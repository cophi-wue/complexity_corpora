 
our
society
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
Cranford
be
in
possession
of
the
Amazons
;
all
the
holder
of
house
above
a
certain
rent
be
woman
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
married
couple
come
to
settle
in
the
town
,
somehow
the
gentleman
disappear
;
he
be
either
fairly
frighten
to

business
all
the
week
in
the
great
neighbouring
commercial
town
of
drumble
,
distant
only
twenty
mile
on
a
railroad
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
whatever
do
become
of
the
gentleman
,
they
be
not
at
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
they
do
if
they
be
there
?
 
<EOS>
the
surgeon
have
his
round
of
thirty
mile
,
and
sleep
at
Cranford
;
but
every
man
can
not
be
a
surgeon
.
 
<EOS>
for
keep
the
trim
garden
full
of
choice
flower
without
a
weed
to
speck
them
;
for
frighten
away
little
boy
who
look
wistfully
at
the
say
flower
through
the
railing
;
for
rush
out
at
the
geese
that
occasionally
venture
in
to
the
garden
if
the
gate
be
leave
open
;
for
decide
all
question
of
literature
and
politic
without
trouble
themselves
with
unnecessary
reason
or
argument
;
for
obtain
clear
and
correct
knowledge
of
everybody
's
affair
in
the
parish
;
for
keep
their
neat
maid
-
servant
in
admirable
order
;
for
kindness
(
somewhat
dictatorial
)
to
the
poor
,
and
real
tender
good
office
to
each
other
whenever
they
be
in
distress
,
the
lady
of
Cranford
be
quite
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
man
,
"
as
one
of
them
observe
to
me
once
,
"
be
so
in
the
way
in
the
house
!
"
 
<EOS>
although
the
lady
of
Cranford
know
all
each
other
's
proceeding
,
they
be
exceedingly
indifferent
to
each
other
's
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
as
each
have
her
own
individuality
,
not
to
say
eccentricity
,
pretty
strongly
developed
,
nothing
be
so
easy
as
verbal
retaliation
;
but
,
somehow
,
good
-
will
reigns
among
them
to
a
considerable
degree
.
  
<EOS>
the
Cranford
lady
have
only
an
occasional
little
quarrel
,
spirit
out
in
a
few
peppery
word
and
angry
jerk
of
the
head
;
just
enough
to
prevent
the
even
tenor
of
their
life
from
become
too
flat
.
 
<EOS>
Their
dress
be
very
independent
of
fashion
;
as
they
observe
,
"
what
do
it
signify
how
we
dress
here
at
Cranford
,
where
everybody
know
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
if
they
go
from
home
,
their
reason
be
equally
cogent
,
"
what
do
it
signify
how
we
dress
here
,
where
nobody
know
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
material
of
their
clothe
be
,
in
general
,
good
and
plain
,
and
most
of
them
be
nearly
as
scrupulous
as
Miss
Tyler
,
of
cleanly
memory
;
but
I
will
answer
for
it
,
the
last
gigot
,
the
last
tight
and
scanty
petticoat
in
wear
in
England
,
be
see
in
Cranford
 
and
see
without
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
testify
to
a
magnificent
family
red
silk
umbrella
,
under
which
a
gentle
little
spinster
,
leave
alone
of
many
brother
and
sister
,
use
to
patter
to
church
on
rainy
day
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
any
red
silk
umbrella
in
London
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
tradition
of
the
first
that
have
ever
be
see
in
Cranford
;
and
the
little
boy
mob
it
,
and
call
it
"
a
stick
in
petticoat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
the
very
red
silk
one
I
have
describe
,
hold
by
a
strong
father
over
a
troop
of
little
one
;
the
poor
little
lady
 
<EOS>
the
survivor
of
all
 
could
scarcely
carry
it
.
  
<EOS>
then
there
be
rule
and
regulation
for
visiting
and
call
;
and
they
be
announce
to
any
young
people
who
may
be
stay
in
the
town
,
with
all
the
solemnity
with
which
the
old
Manx
law
be
read
once
a
year
on
the
Tinwald
Mount
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
have
send
to
inquire
how
you
be
after
your
journey
to
-
night
,
my
dear
"
(
fifteen
mile
in
a
gentleman
's
carriage
)
;
"
they
will
give
you
some
rest
to
-
morrow
,
but
the
next
day
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
they
will
call
;
so
be
at
liberty
after
twelve
 
from
twelve
to
three
<EOS>
be
our
call
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
,
after
they
have
call
     
"
It
be
the
third
day
;
I
dare
say
your
mamma
have
tell
you
,
my
dear
,
never
to
let
more
than
three
day
elapse
between
receive
a
call
and
return
it
;
and
also
,
that
you
be
never
to
stay
longer
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
"
  
"
but
be
I
to
look
at
my
watch
?
 
<EOS>
how
be
I
to
find
out
when
a
quarter
of
an
hour
have
pass
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
keep
think
about
the
time
,
my
dear
,
and
not
allow
yourself
to
forget
it
in
conversation
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
everybody
have
this
rule
in
their
mind
,
whether
they
receive
or
pay
a
call
,
of
course
no
absorb
subject
be
ever
speak
about
.
<EOS>
We
keep
ourselves
to
short
sentence
of
small
talk
,
and
be
punctual
to
our
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
imagine
that
a
few
of
the
gentlefolk
of
Cranford
be
poor
,
and
have
some
difficulty
in
make
both
end
meet
;
but
they
be
like
the
Spartans
,
and
conceal
their
smart
under
a
smile
face
.
 
<EOS>
We
none
of
us
speak
of
money
,
because
that
subject
savour
of
commerce
and
trade
,
and
though
some
may
be
poor
,
we
be
all
aristocratic
.
 
<EOS>
the
Cranfordians
have
that
kindly
esprit
de
corps
which
make
them
overlook
all
deficiency
in
success
when
some
among
them
try
to
conceal
their
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mrs
Forrester
,
for
instance
,
give
a
party
in
her
baby
-
house
of
a
dwelling
,
and
the
little
maiden
disturb
the
lady
on
the
sofa
by
a
request
that
she
may
get
the
tea
-
tray
out
from
underneath
<EOS>
,
everyone
take
this
novel
proceeding
as
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
,
and
talk
on
about
household
form
and
ceremony
as
if
we
all
believe
that
our
hostess
have
a
regular
servant
'
hall
,
second
table
,
with
housekeeper
and
steward
,
instead
of
the
one
little
charity
-
school
maiden
,
whose
short
ruddy
arm
could
never
have
be
strong
enough
to
carry
the
tray
upstairs
,
if
she
have
not
be
assist
in
private
by
her
mistress
,
who
now
sit
in
state
,
pretend
not
to
know
what
cake
be
send
up
,
though
she
know
,
and
we
know
,
and
she
know
that
we
know
,
and
we
know
that
she
know
that
we
know
,
she
have
be
busy
all
the
morning
make
tea
-
bread
and
sponge
-
cake
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
or
two
consequence
arise
from
this
general
but
unacknowledged
poverty
,
and
this
very
much
acknowledge
gentility
,
which
be
not
amiss
,
and
which
may
be
introduce
into
many
circle
of
society
to
their
great
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
the
inhabitant
of
Cranford
keep
early
hour
,
and
clatter
home
in
their
patten
,
under
the
guidance
of
a
lantern
-
bearer
,
about
nine
o'clock
at
night
;
and
the
whole
town
be
abed
and
asleep
by
half
-
past
ten
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
it
be
consider
"
vulgar
"
(
a
tremendous
word
in
Cranford
)
to
give
anything
expensive
,
in
the
way
of
eatable
or
drinkable
,
at
the
evening
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
wafer
bread
-
and
-
butter
and
sponge
-
biscuit
be
all
that
the
honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
give
;
and
she
be
sister
-
in
-
law
to
the
late
Earl
of
Glenmire
,
although
she
do
practise
such
"
elegant
economy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
elegant
economy
!
"
 
<EOS>
how
naturally
one
fall
back
into
the
phraseology
of
Cranford
!
 
<EOS>
there
,
economy
be
always
"
elegant
,
"
and
money
-
spending
always
"
vulgar
and
ostentatious
"
;
a
sort
of
sour
-
grapeism
which
make
us
very
peaceful
and
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
the
dismay
feel
when
a
certain
Captain
Brown
come
to
live
at
Cranford
,
and
openly
speak
about
his
be
poor
 
not
in
a
whisper
to
an
intimate
friend
,
the
door
and
window
be
previously
close
,
but
in
the
public
street
!
<EOS>
in
a
loud
military
voice
!
<EOS>
allege
his
poverty
as
a
reason
for
not
take
a
particular
house
.
<EOS>
the
lady
of
Cranford
be
already
rather
moan
over
the
invasion
of
their
territory
by
a
man
and
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
half
-
pay
captain
,
and
have
obtain
some
situation
on
a
neighbouring
railroad
,
which
have
be
vehemently
petition
against
by
the
little
town
;
and
if
,
in
addition
to
his
masculine
gender
,
and
his
connection
with
the
obnoxious
railroad
,
he
be
so
brazen
as
to
talk
of
be
poor
 
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
indeed
,
he
must
be
send
to
Coventry
.
<EOS>
death
be
as
true
and
as
common
as
poverty
;
yet
people
never
speak
about
that
,
loud
out
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
word
not
to
be
mention
to
ear
polite
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
tacitly
agree
to
ignore
that
any
with
whom
we
associate
on
term
of
visit
equality
could
ever
be
prevent
by
poverty
from
do
anything
that
they
wish
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
walk
to
or
from
a
party
,
it
be
because
the
night
be
so
fine
,
or
the
air
so
refreshing
,
not
because
sedan
-
chair
be
expensive
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
wear
print
,
instead
of
summer
silk
,
it
be
because
we
prefer
a
washing
material
;
and
so
on
,
till
we
blind
ourselves
to
the
vulgar
fact
that
we
be
,
all
of
us
,
people
of
very
moderate
mean
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
then
,
we
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
a
man
who
could
speak
of
poverty
as
if
it
be
not
a
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
somehow
,
Captain
Brown
make
himself
respect
in
Cranford
,
and
be
call
upon
,
in
spite
of
all
resolution
to
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
to
hear
his
opinion
quote
as
authority
at
a
visit
which
I
pay
to
Cranford
about
a
year
after
he
have
settle
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
friend
have
be
among
the
bitter
opponent
of
any
proposal
to
visit
the
Captain
and
his
daughter
,
only
twelve
month
before
;
and
now
he
be
even
admit
in
the
tabooed
hour
before
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
true
,
it
be
to
discover
the
cause
of
a
smoking
chimney
,
before
the
fire
be
light
;
but
still
Captain
Brown
walk
upstairs
,
nothing
daunt
,
speak
in
a
voice
too
large
for
the
room
,
and
joke
quite
in
the
way
of
a
tame
man
about
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
blind
to
all
the
small
slight
,
and
omission
of
trivial
ceremony
,
with
which
he
have
be
receive
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
friendly
,
though
the
Cranford
lady
have
be
cool
;
he
have
answer
small
sarcastic
compliment
in
good
faith
;
and
with
his
manly
frankness
have
overpower
all
the
shrinking
which
meet
him
as
a
man
who
be
not
ashamed
to
be
poor
.
<EOS>
and
,
at
last
,
his
excellent
masculine
common
sense
,
and
<EOS>
his
facility
in
devise
expedient
to
overcome
domestic
dilemma
,
have
gain
him
an
extraordinary
place
as
authority
among
the
Cranford
lady
.
 
<EOS>
He
himself
go
on
in
his
course
,
as
unaware
of
his
popularity
as
he
have
be
of
the
reverse
;
and
I
be
sure
he
be
startle
one
day
when
he
find
his
advice
so
highly
esteem
as
to
make
some
counsel
which
he
have
give
in
jest
to
be
take
in
sober
,
serious
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
subject
:
 
<EOS>
an
old
lady
have
an
Alderney
cow
,
which
she
look
upon
as
a
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
You
could
not
pay
the
short
quarter
of
an
hour
call
without
be
tell
of
the
wonderful
milk
or
wonderful
intelligence
of
this
animal
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
town
know
and
kindly
regard
Miss
Betsy
Barker
's
Alderney
;
therefore
great
be
the
sympathy
and
regret
when
,
in
an
unguarded
moment
,
the
poor
cow
tumble
into
a
lime
-
pit
.
 
<EOS>
She
moan
so
loudly
that
she
be
soon
hear
and
rescue
;
but
meanwhile
the
poor
beast
have
lose
most
of
her
hair
,
and
come
out
look
naked
,
cold
,
and
miserable
,
in
a
bare
skin
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
pity
the
animal
,
though
a
few
could
not
restrain
their
smile
at
her
droll
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Betsy
Barker
absolutely
cry
with
sorrow
and
dismay
;
and
it
be
say
she
think
of
try
a
bath
of
oil
.
 
<EOS>
this
remedy
,
perhaps
,
be
recommend
by
some
one
of
the
number
whose
advice
she
ask
;
but
the
proposal
,
if
ever
it
be
make
,
be
knock
on
the
head
by
Captain
Brown
's
decide
<EOS>
"
get
her
a
flannel
waistcoat
and
flannel
drawer
,
madam
,
if
you
wish
to
keep
her
alive
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
advice
be
,
kill
the
poor
creature
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Betsy
Barker
dry
her
eye
,
and
thank
the
Captain
heartily
;
she
set
to
work
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
all
the
town
turn
out
to
see
the
Alderney
meekly
go
to
her
pasture
,
clothe
in
dark
grey
flannel
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
watch
her
myself
many
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
ever
see
cow
dress
in
grey
flannel
in
London
?
  
<EOS>
Captain
Brown
have
take
a
small
house
on
the
outskirt
of
the
town
,
where
he
live
with
his
two
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
be
upwards
of
sixty
at
the
time
of
the
first
visit
I
pay
to
Cranford
after
I
have
leave
it
as
a
residence
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
a
wiry
,
well
-
train
,
elastic
figure
,
<EOS>
a
stiff
military
throw
-
back
of
his
head
,
and
a
springing
step
,
which
make
him
appear
much
young
than
he
be
.
<EOS>
His
eld
daughter
look
almost
as
old
as
himself
,
and
betray
the
fact
that
his
real
be
more
than
his
apparent
age
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Brown
must
have
be
forty
;
she
have
a
sickly
,
pain
,
careworn
expression
on
her
face
,
and
look
as
if
the
gaiety
of
youth
have
long
fade
out
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
young
she
must
have
be
plain
and
hard

feature

<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
Brown
be
ten
year
young
than
her
sister
,
and
twenty
shade
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
be
round
and
dimple
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
once
say
,
in
a
passion
against
Captain
Brown
(
the
cause
of
which
I
will
tell
you
presently
)
,
"
that
she
think
it
be
time
for
Miss
Jessie
to
leave
off
her
dimple
,
and
not
always
to
be
try
to
look
like
a
child
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
there
be
something
childlike
in
her
face
;
and
there
will
be
,
I
think
,
till
she
die
,
though
she
should
live
to
a
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
large
blue
wonder
eye
,
look
straight
at
you
;
her
nose
be
unformed
and
snub
,
and
her
lip
be
red
and
dewy
;
she
wear
her
hair
,
too
,
in
little
row
of
curl
,
which
heighten
this
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
she
be
pretty
or
not
;
but
I
like
her
face
,
and
so
do
everybody
,
and
I
do
not
think
she
could
help
her
dimple
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
something
of
her
father
's
jauntiness
of
gait
and
manner
;
and
any
female
observer
may
detect
a
slight
difference
in
the
attire
of
the
two
sister
 
that
of
Miss
Jessie
be
about
two
pound
per
annum
more
expensive
than
Miss
Brown
's
.
 
<EOS>
two
pound
be
a
large
sum
in
Captain
Brown
's
annual
disbursement
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
impression
make
upon
me
by
the
Brown
family
when
I
first
see
them
all
together
in
Cranford
Church
.
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
I
have
meet
before
 
on
the
occasion
of
the
smoky
chimney
,
which
he
have
cure
by
some
simple
alteration
in
the
flue
.
 
<EOS>
in
church
,
he
hold
his
double
eye
-
glass
to
his
eye
during
the
Morning
Hymn
,
and
then
lift
up
his
head
erect
and
sing
out
loud
and
joyfully
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
the
response
loud
than
the
clerk
 
an
old
man
with
a
piping
feeble
voice
,
who
,
I
think
,
feel
aggrieve
at
the
Captain
's
sonorous
bass
,
and
quiver
high
and
high
in
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
on
come
out
of
church
,
the
brisk
Captain
pay
the
most
gallant
attention
to
his
two
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
He
nod
and
smile
to
his
acquaintance
;
but
he
shake
hand
with
none
until
he
have
help
Miss
Brown
to
unfurl
her
umbrella
,
have
relieve
her
of
her
prayer
-
book
,
and
have
wait
patiently
till
she
,
with
tremble
nervous
hand
,
have
take
up
her
gown
to
walk
through
the
wet
road
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
the
Cranford
lady
do
with
Captain
Brown
at
their
party
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
often
rejoice
,
in
former
day
,
that
there
be
no
gentleman
to
be
attend
to
,
and
to
find
conversation
for
,
at
the
card
-
party
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
congratulate
ourselves
upon
the
snugness
of
the
evening
;
and
,
in
our
love
for
gentility
,
and
distaste
of
mankind
,
we
have
almost
persuade
ourselves
that
to
be
a
man
be
to
be
"
vulgar
"
;
so
that
when
I
find
my
friend
and
hostess
,
Miss
Jenkyns
,
be
go
to
have
a
party
in
my
honour
,
and
that
Captain
and
the
Miss
Browns
be
invite
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
much
what
would
be
the
course
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
card
-
table
,
with
green
baize
top
,
be
set
out
by
daylight
,
just
as
usual
;
it
be
the
third
week
in
November
,
so
the
evening
close
in
about
four
.
 
<EOS>
candle
,
and
clean
pack
of
card
,
be
arrange
on
each
table
.
 
<EOS>
the
fire
be
make
up
;
the
neat
maid
-
servant
have
receive
her
last
direction
;
and
there
we
stand
,
dress
in
our
good
,
each
with
a
candle
-
light
in
our
hand
,
ready
to
dart
at
the
candle
as
soon
as
the
first
knock
come
.
 
<EOS>
Parties
in
Cranford
be
solemn
festivity
,
make
the
lady
feel
gravely
elated
as
they
sit
together
in
their
good
dress
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
three
have
arrive
,
we
sit
down
to
"
preference
,
"
I
be
the
unlucky
fourth
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
four
comer
be
put
down
immediately
to
another
table
;
and
presently
the
tea
-
tray
,
which
I
have
see
set
out
in
the
store
-
room
as
I
pass
in
the
morning
,
be
place
each
on
the
middle
of
a
card
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
the
china
be
delicate
egg
-
shell
;
the
old
-
fashioned
silver
glitter
with
polishing
;
but
the
eatable
be
of
the
slight
description
.
<EOS>
while
the
tray
be
yet
on
the
table
,
Captain
and
the
Miss
Browns
come
in
;
and
I
could
see
that
,
somehow
or
other
,
the
Captain
be
a
favourite
with
all
the
lady
present
.
 
<EOS>
ruffle
brow
be
smooth
,
sharp
voice
lower
at
his
approach
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Brown
look
ill
,
and
depress
almost
to
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
smile
as
usual
,
and
seem
nearly
as
popular
as
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
immediately
and
quietly
assume
the
man
's
place
in
the
room
;
attend
to
every
one
's
want
,
lessen
the
pretty
maid
-
servant
's
labour
by
wait
on
empty
cup
and
bread
-
and
-
butterless
lady
;
and
yet
do
it
all
in
so
easy
and
dignify
a
manner
,
and
so
much
as
if
it
be
a
matter
of
course
for
the
strong
to
attend
to
the
weak
,
that
he
be
a
true
man
throughout
.
 
<EOS>
He
play
for
threepenny
point
with
as
grave
an
interest
as
if
they
have
be
pound
;
and
yet
,
in
all
his
attention
to
stranger
,
he
have
an
eye
on
his
suffer
daughter
 
for
suffer
I
be
sure
she
be
,
though
to
many
eye
she
may
only
appear
to
be
irritable
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
could
not
play
card
:
but
she
talk
to
the
sitter
-
out
,
who
,
before
her
come
,
have
be
rather
inclined
to
be
cross
.
 
<EOS>
She
sing
,
too
,
to
an
old
crack
piano
,
which
I
think
have
be
a
spinet
in
its
youth
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
sing
,
"
Jock
of
Hazeldean
"
a
little
out
of
tune
;
but
we
be
none
of
us
musical
,
though
Miss
Jenkyns
beat
time
,
out
of
time
,
by
way
of
appear
to
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
good
of
Miss
Jenkyns
to
do
this
;
for
I
have
see
that
,
a
little
before
,
she
have
be
a
good
deal
annoy
by
Miss
Jessie
Brown
's
unguarded
admission
(
a
propos
of
Shetland
wool
)
that
she
have
an
uncle
,
her
mother
's
brother
,
who
be
a
shop
-
keeper
in
Edinburgh
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
try
to
drown
this
confession
by
a
terrible
cough
 
for
the
honourable
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
be
sit
at
a
card
-
table
near
Miss
Jessie
,
and
what
would
she
say
or
think
if
she
find
out
she
be
in
the
same
room
with
a
shop
-
keeper
's
niece
!
<EOS>
but
Miss
Jessie
Brown
(
who
have
no
tact
,
as
we
all
agree
the
next
morning
)
WOULD
repeat
the
information
,
and
assure
Miss
Pole
she
could
easily
get
her
the
identical
Shetland
wool
require
,
"
through
my
uncle
,
who
have
the
good
assortment
of
Shetland
good
of
any
one
in
Edinbro
'
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
take
the
taste
of
this
out
of
our
mouth
,
and
the
sound
of
this
out
of
our
ear
,
that
Miss
Jenkyns
propose
music
;
so
I
say
again
,
it
be
very
good
of
her
to
beat
time
to
the
song
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
tray
re
-
appear
with
biscuit
and
wine
,
punctually
at
a
quarter
to
nine
,
there
be
conversation
,
compare
of
card
,
and
talk
over
trick
;
but
by
-
and
-
by
Captain
Brown
sport
a
bit
of
literature
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
see
any
number
of
"
the
Pickwick
Papers
"
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
(
They
we
be
then
publish
in
part
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
capital
thing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
Miss
Jenkyns
be
daughter
of
a
deceased
rector
of
Cranford
;
and
,
on
the
strength
of
a
number
of
manuscript
sermon
,
and
a
pretty
good
library
of
divinity
,
consider
herself
literary
,
and
look
upon
any
conversation
about
book
as
a
challenge
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
answer
and
say
,
"
yes
,
she
have
see
them
;
indeed
,
she
may
say
she
have
read
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
you
think
of
them
?
"
exclaim
Captain
Brown
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
not
they
famously
good
?
"
  
<EOS>
so
urge
Miss
Jenkyns
could
not
but
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
,
I
do
not
think
they
be
by
any
mean
equal
to
Dr
Johnson
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
perhaps
,
the
author
be
young
.
 
<EOS>
let
him
persevere
,
and
who
know
what
he
may
become
if
he
will
take
the
great
doctor
for
his
model
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
evidently
too
much
for
Captain
Brown
to
take
placidly
;
and
I
see
the
word
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
before
Miss
Jenkyns
have
finish
her
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
a
different
sort
of
thing
,
my
dear
madam
,
"
he
begin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
aware
of
that
,
"
return
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
make
allowance
,
Captain
Brown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
just
allow
me
to
read
you
a
scene
out
of
this
month
's
number
,
"
plead
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
it
only
this
morning
,
and
I
do
not
think
the
company
can
have
read
it
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
as
you
please
,
"
say
she
,
settle
herself
with
an
air
of
resignation
.
 
<EOS>
He
read
the
account
of
the
"
swarry
"
which
Sam
Weller
give
at
Bath
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
us
laugh
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
dare
,
because
I
be
stay
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
sit
in
patient
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
end
,
she
turn
to
me
,
and
say
with
mild
dignity
     
<EOS>
"
fetch
me
"
Rasselas
,
"
my
dear
,
out
of
the
book
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
bring
it
to
her
,
she
turn
to
Captain
Brown
     
"
now
allow
me
to
read
you
a
scene
,
and
then
the
present
company
can
judge
between
your
favourite
,
Mr
Boz
,
and
Dr
Johnson
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
read
one
of
the
conversation
between
Rasselas
and
Imlac
,
in
a
high
-
pitched
,
majestic
voice
:
 
and
when
she
have
end
,
she
say
,
"
I
imagine
I
be
now
justified
in
my
preference
of
Dr
Johnson
as
a
writer
of
fiction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
screw
his
lip
up
,
and
drum
on
the
table
,
but
he
do
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
She
think
she
would
give
him
a
finish
blow
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
consider
it
vulgar
,
and
below
the
dignity
of
literature
,
to
publish
in
number
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
the
Rambler
publish
,
madam
?
"
ask
Captain
Brown
in
a
low
voice
,
which
I
think
Miss
Jenkyns
could
not
have
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr
Johnson
's
style
be
a
model
for
young
beginner
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
recommend
it
to
me
when
I
begin
to
write
letter
 
I
have
form
my
own
style
upon
it
;
I
recommend
it
to
your
favourite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
sorry
for
him
to
exchange
his
style
for
any
such
pompous
writing
,
"
say
Captain
Brown
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
feel
this
as
a
personal
affront
,
in
a
way
of
which
the
Captain
have
not
dream
.
 
<EOS>
epistolary
write
she
and
her
friend
consider
as
her
forte
.
 
<EOS>
many
a
copy
of
many
a
letter
have
I
see
write
and
correct
on
the
slate
,
before
she
"
seize
the
half
-
hour
just
previous
to
post
-
time
to
assure
"
her
friend
of
this
or
of
that
;
and
Dr
Johnson
be
,
as
she
say
,
her
model
in
these
composition
.
 
<EOS>
She
draw
herself
up
with
dignity
,
and
only
reply
to
Captain
Brown
's
last
remark
by
say
,
with
marked
emphasis
on
every
syllable
,
"
I
prefer
Dr
Johnson
to
Mr
Boz
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
say
 
I
will
not
vouch
for
the
fact
 
that
Captain
Brown
be
hear
to
say
,
sotto
voce
,
"
D
-
<EOS>
n
Dr
Johnson
!
"
 
<EOS>
if
he
do
,
he
be
penitent
afterwards
,
as
he
show
by
go
to
stand
near
Miss
Jenkyns
'
arm
-
chair
,
and
endeavour
to
beguile
her
into
conversation
on
some
more
pleasing
subject
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
inexorable
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
day
she
make
the
remark
I
have
mention
about
Miss
Jessie
's
dimple
.
   
<EOS>
the
captain
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
live
a
month
at
Cranford
and
not
know
the
daily
habit
of
each
resident
;
and
long
before
my
visit
be
end
<EOS>
I
know
much
concern
the
whole
Brown
trio
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
new
to
be
discover
respect
their
poverty
;
for
they
have
speak
simply
and
openly
about
that
from
the
very
first
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
no
mystery
of
the
necessity
for
their
be
economical
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
remain
to
be
discover
be
the
Captain
's
infinite
kindness
of
heart
,
and
the
various
mode
in
which
,
unconsciously
to
himself
,
he
manifest
it
.
 
<EOS>
some
little
anecdote
be
talk
about
for
some
time
after
they
occur
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
do
not
read
much
,
and
as
all
the
lady
be
pretty
well
suited
with
servant
,
there
be
a
dearth
of
subject
for
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
We
therefore
discuss
the
circumstance
of
the
Captain
take
a
poor
old
woman
's
dinner
out
of
her
hand
one
very
slippery
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
meet
her
return
from
the
bakehouse
as
he
come
from
church
,
and
notice
her
precarious
footing
;
and
,
with
the
grave
dignity
with
which
he
do
everything
,
he
relieve
her
of
her
burden
,
and
steer
along
the
street
by
her
side
,
carry
her
bake
mutton
and
potato
safely
home
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
think
very
eccentric
;
and
it
be
rather
expect
that
he
would
pay
a
round
of
call
,
on
the
Monday
morning
,
to
explain
and
apologise
to
the
Cranford
sense
of
propriety
:
 
<EOS>
but
he
do
no
such
thing
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
it
be
decide
that
he
be
ashamed
,
and
be
keep
out
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
kindly
pity
for
him
,
we
begin
to
say
,
"
after
all
,
the
Sunday
morning
's
occurrence
show
great
goodness
of
heart
,
"
and
it
be
resolve
that
he
should
be
comfort
on
his
next
appearance
amongst
us
;
but
,
lo
!
<EOS>
he
come
down
upon
us
,
untouched
by
any
sense
of
shame
,
speak
loud
and
bass
as
ever
,
his
head
throw
back
,
his
wig
as
jaunty
and
well
-
curl
as
usual
,
and
we
be
oblige
to
conclude
he
have
forget
all
about
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
and
Miss
Jessie
Brown
have
set
up
a
kind
of
intimacy
on
the
strength
of
the
Shetland
wool
and
the
new
knitting
stitch
;
so
it
happen
that
when
I
go
to
visit
Miss
Pole
I
see
more
of
the
Browns
than
I
have
do
while
stay
with
Miss
Jenkyns
,
who
have
never
get
over
what
she
call
Captain
Brown
's
disparaging
remark
upon
Dr
Johnson
as
a
writer
of
light
and
agreeable
fiction
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
that
Miss
Brown
be
seriously
ill
of
some
linger
,
incurable
complaint
,
the
pain
occasion
by
which
give
the
uneasy
expression
to
her
face
that
I
have
take
for
unmitigated
crossness
.
<EOS>
cross
,
too
,
she
be
at
time
,
when
the
nervous
irritability
occasion
by
her
disease
become
past
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
bear
with
her
at
these
time
,
even
more
patiently
than
she
do
with
the
bitter
self
-
upbraiding
by
which
they
be
invariably
succeed
.
<EOS>
Miss
Brown
use
to
accuse
herself
,
not
merely
of
hasty
and
irritable
temper
,
but
also
of
be
the
cause
why
her
father
and
sister
be
oblige
to
pinch
,
in
order
to
allow
her
the
small
luxury
which
be
necessary
in
her
condition
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
so
fain
have
make
sacrifice
for
them
,
and
have
lighten
their
care
,
that
the
original
generosity
of
her
disposition
add
acerbity
to
her
temper
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
bear
by
Miss
Jessie
and
her
father
with
more
than
placidity
 
with
absolute
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgave
Miss
Jessie
her
singing
out
of
tune
,
and
her
juvenility
of
dress
,
when
I
see
her
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
to
perceive
that
Captain
Brown
's
dark
Brutus
wig
and
pad
coat
<EOS>
(
alas
!
too
often
threadbare
)
be
remnant
of
the
military
smartness
of
his
youth
,
which
he
now
wear
unconsciously
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
infinite
resource
,
gain
in
his
barrack
experience
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
confess
,
no
one
could
black
his
boot
to
please
him
except
himself
;
but
,
indeed
,
he
be
not
above
save
the
little
maid
-
servant
's
labour
in
every
way
 
<EOS>
knowing
,
most
likely
,
that
his
daughter
's
illness
make
the
place
a
hard
one
.
  
<EOS>
He
endeavour
to
make
peace
with
Miss
Jenkyns
soon
after
the
memorable
dispute
I
have
name
,
by
a
present
of
a
wooden
fire
-
shovel
(
his
own
making
)
,
have
hear
her
say
how
much
the
grating
of
an
iron
one
annoy
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
receive
the
present
with
cool
gratitude
,
and
thank
him
formally
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
she
bid
me
put
it
away
in
the
lumber
-
room
;
feeling
,
probably
,
that
no
present
from
a
man
who
prefer
Mr
Boz
to
Dr
Johnson
could
be
less
jarring
than
an
iron
fire
-
shovel
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
state
of
thing
when
I
leave
Cranford
and
go
to
Drumble
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
,
however
,
several
correspondent
,
who
keep
me
au
fait
as
to
the
proceeding
of
the
dear
little
town
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
Miss
Pole
,
who
be
become
as
much
absorb
in
crochet
as
she
have
be
once
in
knitting
,
and
<EOS>
the
burden
of
whose
letter
be
something
like
,
"
<EOS>
but
do
not
you
forget
the
white
worst
at
Flint
's
"
of
the
old
song
;
for
at
the
end
of
every
sentence
of
news
come
a
fresh
direction
as
to
some
crochet
commission
which
I
be
to
execute
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matilda
Jenkyns
(
who
do
not
mind
be
call
Miss
Matty
,
when
Miss
Jenkyns
be
not
by
)
write
nice
,
kind
,
ramble
letter
,
now
and
then
venture
into
an
opinion
of
her
own
;
but
suddenly
pull
herself
up
,
and
either
beg
me
not
to
name
what
she
have
say
,
as
Deborah
think
differently
,
and
SHE
know
,
or
else
put
in
a
postscript
to
the
effect
that
,
since
write
the
above
,
she
have
be
talk
over
the
subject
with
Deborah
,
and
be
quite
convinced
that
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
(
here
probably
follow
a
recantation
of
every
opinion
she
have
give
in
the
letter
)
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
Miss
Jenkyns
 
Deborah
,
as
she
like
Miss
Matty
to
call
her
<EOS>
,
her
father
have
once
say
that
the
hebrew
name
ought
to
be
so
pronounce
.
 
<EOS>
I
secretly
think
she
take
the
Hebrew
prophetess
for
a
model
in
character
;
and
,
indeed
,
she
be
not
unlike
the
stern
prophetess
in
some
way
,
make
allowance
,
of
course
,
for
modern
custom
and
difference
in
dress
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
wear
a
cravat
,
and
a
little
bonnet
like
a
jockey
-
cap
,
and
altogether
have
the
appearance
of
a
strong
-
minded
woman
;
although
she
would
have
despise
the
modern
idea
of
woman
be
equal
to
man
.
 
<EOS>
equal
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
she
know
they
be
superior
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
her
letter
.
 
<EOS>
everything
in
them
be
stately
and
grand
like
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
look
them
over
(
dear
Miss
Jenkyns
<EOS>
,
how
I
honour
her
!
)
<EOS>
and
I
will
give
an
extract
,
more
especially
because
it
relate
to
our
friend
Captain
Brown
:
    
<EOS>
"
the
honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
have
only
just
quit
me
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
she
communicate
to
me
the
intelligence
that
she
have
yesterday
receive
a
call
from
her
revered
husband
's
quondam
friend
,
Lord
Mauleverer
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
easily
conjecture
what
bring
his
lordship
within
the
precinct
of
our
little
town
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
see
Captain
Brown
,
with
whom
,
it
appear
,
his
lordship
be
acquaint
in
the
"
plume
war
,
"
and
who
have
the
privilege
of
avert
destruction
from
his
lordship
's
head
when
some
great
peril
be
impend
over
it
,
off
the
misnomere
Cape
of
Good
Hope
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
our
friend
the
honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
's
deficiency
in
the
spirit
of
innocent
curiosity
,
and
you
will
therefore
not
be
so
much
surprised
when
I
tell
you
she
be
quite
unable
to
disclose
to
me
the
exact
nature
of
the
peril
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
anxious
<EOS>
,
I
confess
,
to
ascertain
in
what
manner
Captain
Brown
,
with
his
limited
establishment
,
could
receive
<EOS>
so
distinguish
a
guest
;
and
I
discover
that
his
lordship
retire
to
rest
,
and
,
let
us
hope
,
to
refresh
slumber
,
at
the
Angel
Hotel
;
but
share
the
brunonian
meal
during
the
two
day
that
he
honour
Cranford
with
his
august
presence
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Johnson
,
our
civil
butcher
's
wife
,
inform
me
that
Miss
Jessie
purchase
a
leg
of
lamb
;
but
,
besides
this
,
I
can
hear
of
no
preparation
whatever
to
give
a
suitable
reception
to
so
distinguish
a
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
they
entertain
him
with
"
the
feast
of
reason
and
the
flow
of
soul
"
;
and
to
us
,
who
be
acquaint
with
Captain
Brown
's
sad
want
of
relish
for
"
the
pure
well
of
English
undefile
,
"
it
may
be
matter
for
congratulation
that
he
have
have
the
opportunity
of
improve
his
taste
by
hold
converse
with
an
elegant
and
refined
member
of
the
british
aristocracy
.
 
<EOS>
but
from
some
mundane
failing
who
be
altogether
free
?
"
  
Miss
Pole
and
Miss
Matty
write
to
me
by
the
same
post
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
piece
of
news
as
Lord
Mauleverer
's
visit
be
not
to
be
lose
on
the
Cranford
letter
-
writer
:
 
<EOS>
they
make
the
most
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
humbly
apologise
for
write
at
the
same
time
as
her
sister
,
who
be
so
much
more
capable
than
she
to
describe
the
honour
do
to
Cranford
;
but
in
spite
of
a
little
bad
spelling
,
Miss
Matty
's
account
give
me
the
good
idea
of
the
commotion
occasion
by
his
lordship
's
visit
,
after
it
have
occur
;
for
,
except
the
people
at
the
Angel
,
the
Browns
,
Mrs
Jamieson
,
and
a
little
lad
his
lordship
have
swear
at
for
drive
a
dirty
hoop
against
the
aristocratic
leg
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
hear
of
any
one
with
whom
his
lordship
have
hold
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
visit
to
Cranford
be
in
the
summer
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
neither
birth
,
death
,
nor
marriage
since
I
be
there
last
.
<EOS>
everybody
live
in
the
same
house
,
and
wear
pretty
nearly
the
same
well
-
preserve
,
old
-
fashioned
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
event
be
,
that
Miss
Jenkyns
have
purchase
a
new
carpet
for
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
oh
,
the
busy
work
Miss
Matty
<EOS>
and
I
have
in
chase
the
sunbeam
,
as
they
fall
in
an
afternoon
right
down
on
this
carpet
through
the
blindless
window
!
 
<EOS>
We
spread
newspaper
over
the
place
and
sit
down
to
our
book
or
our
work
;
and
,
lo
!
<EOS>
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
sun
have
move
,
and
be
blaze
away
on
a
fresh
spot
;
and
down
again
we
go
on
our
knee
to
alter
the
position
of
the
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
very
busy
,
too
,
one
whole
morning
,
before
Miss
Jenkyns
give
her
party
,
in
follow
her
direction
,
and
in
cut
out
and
stitch
together
piece
of
newspaper
so
as
to
form
little
path
to
every
chair
set
for
the
expect
visitor
,
lest
their
shoe
may
dirty
or
defile
the
purity
of
the
carpet
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
make
paper
path
for
every
guest
to
walk
upon
in
London
?
  
<EOS>
Captain
Brown
and
Miss
Jenkyns
be
not
very
cordial
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
the
literary
dispute
,
of
which
I
have
see
the
beginning
,
be
a
"
raw
,
"
the
slight
touch
on
which
make
them
wince
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
difference
of
opinion
they
have
ever
have
;
but
that
difference
be
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
could
not
refrain
from
talk
at
Captain
Brown
;
and
,
though
he
do
not
reply
,
he
drum
with
his
finger
,
which
action
<EOS>
she
feel
and
resent
as
very
disparage
to
Dr
Johnson
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
rather
ostentatious
in
his
preference
of
the
writing
of
Mr
Boz
;
would
walk
through
the
street
so
absorb
in
them
that
he
all
but
run
against
Miss
Jenkyns
;
and
though
his
apology
be
earnest
and
sincere
,
and
though
he
do
not
,
in
fact
,
do
more
than
startle
her
and
himself
,
she
own
to
me
<EOS>
she
have
<EOS>
rather
he
have
knock
her
down
,
if
he
have
only
be
read
a
high
style
of
literature
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
,
brave
Captain
!
<EOS>
he
look
old
,
and
more
worn
,
and
his
clothe
be
very
threadbare
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
seem
as
bright
and
cheerful
as
ever
,
unless
he
be
ask
about
his
daughter
's
health
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
suffer
a
great
deal
,
and
she
must
suffer
more
:
 
<EOS>
we
do
what
we
can
to
alleviate
her
pain
;
 
God
's
will
be
do
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
take
off
his
hat
at
these
last
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
,
from
Miss
Matty
,
that
everything
have
be
do
,
in
fact
.
 
<EOS>
a
medical
man
,
of
high
repute
in
that
country
neighbourhood
,
have
be
send
for
,
and
every
injunction
he
have
give
be
attend
to
,
regardless
of
expense
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
be
sure
they
deny
themselves
many
thing
in
order
to
make
the
invalid
comfortable
;
but
they
never
speak
about
it
;
and
as
for
Miss
Jessie
!
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
she
be
an
angel
,
"
say
poor
Miss
Matty
,
quite
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
see
her
way
of
bear
with
Miss
Brown
's
crossness
,
and
the
bright
face
she
put
on
after
she
be
be
sit
up
a
whole
night
and
scold
above
half
of
it
,
be
quite
beautiful
.
<EOS>
yet
she
look
as
neat
and
as
ready
to
welcome
the
Captain
at
breakfast
-
time
as
if
she
have
be
asleep
in
the
Queen
's
bed
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
!
<EOS>
you
could
never
laugh
at
her
prim
little
curl
or
her
pink
bow
again
if
you
see
her
as
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
feel
very
penitent
,
and
greet
Miss
Jessie
with
double
respect
when
I
meet
her
next
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
faded
and
pinch
;
and
her
lip
begin
to
quiver
,
as
if
she
be
very
weak
,
when
she
speak
of
her
sister
.
<EOS>
but
she
brighten
,
and
send
back
the
tear
that
be
glitter
in
her
pretty
eye
,
as
she
say
     
<EOS>
"
but
,
to
be
sure
,
what
a
town
Cranford
be
for
kindness
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
any
one
have
a
well
dinner
than
usual
cook
but
the
good
part
of
all
come
in
a
little
covered
basin
for
my
sister
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
people
will
leave
their
early
vegetable
at
our
door
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
They
speak
short
and
gruff
,
as
if
they
be
ashamed
of
it
:
but
I
be
sure
it
often
go
to
my
heart
to
see
their
thoughtfulness
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
tear
now
come
back
and
overflow
;
but
after
a
minute
or
two
she
begin
to
scold
herself
,
and
end
by
go
away
the
same
cheerful
Miss
Jessie
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
do
not
this
Lord
Mauleverer
do
something
for
the
man
who
save
his
life
?
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
see
,
unless
Captain
Brown
have
some
reason
for
it
,
he
never
speak
about
be
poor
;
and
he
walk
along
by
his
lordship
look
as
happy
and
cheerful
as
a
prince
;
and
as
they
never
call
attention
to
their
dinner
by
apology
,
and
as
Miss
Brown
be
well
that
day
,
and
all
seem
bright
<EOS>
,
I
daresay
his
lordship
never
know
how
much
care
there
be
in
the
background
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
send
game
in
the
winter
pretty
often
,
but
now
he
be
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
occasion
to
notice
the
use
that
be
make
of
fragment
and
small
opportunity
in
Cranford
;
the
rose
-
leave
that
be
gather
ere
they
fall
to
make
into
a
potpourri
for
someone
who
have
no
garden
;
the
little
bundle
of
lavender
flower
send
to
strew
the
drawer
of
some
town
-
dweller
,
or
to
burn
in
the
chamber
of
some
invalid
.
 
<EOS>
thing
that
many
would
despise
,
and
action
which
it
seem
scarcely
worth
while
to
perform
,
be
all
attend
to
in
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
stick
an
apple
full
of
clove
,
to
be
heat
and
smell
pleasantly
in
Miss
Brown
's
room
;
and
as
she
put
in
each
clove
she
utter
a
johnsonian
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
never
could
think
of
the
Browns
without
talk
Johnson
;
and
,
as
they
be
seldom
absent
from
her
thought
just
then
,
I
hear
many
a
rolling
,
three
-
pile
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Brown
call
one
day
to
thank
Mist
Jenkyns
for
many
little
kindness
,
which
I
do
not
know
until
then
that
she
have
render
.
<EOS>
He
have
suddenly
become
like
an
old
man
;
his
deep
bass
voice
have
a
quavering
in
it
,
his
eye
look
dim
,
and
the
line
on
his
face
be
deep
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
 
could
not
 
speak
cheerfully
of
his
daughter
's
state
,
but
he
talk
with
manly
,
pious
resignation
,
and
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
twice
over
<EOS>
he
say
,
"
what
Jessie
have
be
to
us
,
God
only
know
!
"
<EOS>
and
after
the
second
time
,
he
get
up
hastily
,
shake
hand
all
round
without
speak
,
and
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
that
afternoon
we
perceive
little
group
in
the
street
,
all
listen
with
face
aghast
to
some
tale
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
wonder
what
could
be
the
matter
for
some
time
before
she
take
the
undignified
step
of
send
Jenny
out
to
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
Jenny
come
back
with
a
white
face
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
and
she
burst
into
tear
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
along
with
many
other

have
experience
the
poor
Captain

Good

Miss

Poor

<EOS>
the
great
rough
carter
pucker
up
his
manly
face
,
and
turn
away
to
hide
his
tear

I

She

Miss

give
the
man
a
glass
of
wine

<EOS>
while
she
be

Miss

and
I
huddle
over
the
fire

talk
in

<EOS>
I
know
we

<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
come
home
in
a
silent
mood

and
we
durst
not

her
many
question

<EOS>
She
tell

that
Miss

and
that
she
and
Miss

but
that
,
as
soon
as

she
beg
one

sit
with

"

say
Miss

shiver
with
feeling
to
which
she
dare
not

<EOS>
"
but
how
can

"
ask
Miss

;
"
you
can

she
must
see
your

<EOS>
"
God
will

I
will
not

<EOS>
she
be
asleep
when
the
news
come
;
she
may
be
asleep
yet
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
be
so
utterly
miserable
,
not
merely
at
my
father
's
death
,
but
to
think
of
what
would
become
of
me
;
she
be
so
good
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
look
up
earnestly
in
their
face
with
her
soft
true
eye
,
and
Miss
Pole
tell
Miss
Jenkyns
afterwards
<EOS>
she
could
hardly
bear
it
,
know
,
as
she
do
<EOS>
,
how
Miss
Brown
treat
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
settle
accord
to
Miss
Jessie
's
wish
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Brown
be
to
be
tell
her
father
have
be
summon
to
take
a
short
journey
on
railway
business
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
manage
it
in
some
way
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
could
not
exactly
say
how
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
be
to
stop
with
Miss
Jessie
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
have
send
to
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
all
we
hear
that
night
;
and
a
sorrowful
night
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
day
a
full
account
of
the
fatal
accident
be
in
the
county
paper
which
Miss
Jenkyns
take
in
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
very
weak
,
she
say
,
and
she
ask
me
to
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
the
"
gallant
gentleman
be
deeply
engage
in
the
perusal
of
a
number
of
"
Pickwick
,
"
which
he
have
just
receive
,
<EOS>
"
Miss
Jenkyns
shake
her
head
long
and
solemnly
,
and
then
sigh
out
,
"
poor
,
dear
,
infatuated
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
corpse
be
to
be
take
from
the
station
to
the
parish
church
,
there
to
be
inter
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
have
set
her
heart
on
follow
it
to
the
grave
;
and
no
dissuasive
could
alter
her
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
Her
restraint
upon
herself
make
her
almost
obstinate
;
she
resist
all
Miss
Pole
's
entreaty
and
Miss
Jenkyns
'
advice
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
Miss
Jenkyns
give
up
the
point
;
and
after
a
silence
,
which
I
fear
portend
some
deep
displeasure
against
Miss
Jessie
,
Miss
Jenkyns
say
she
should
accompany
the
latter
to
the
funeral
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
fit
for
you
to
go
alone
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
against
both
propriety
and
humanity
<EOS>
be
I
to
allow
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
seem
as
if
she
do
not
half
like
this
arrangement
;
but
her
obstinacy
,
if
she
have
any
,
have
be
exhaust
in
her
determination
to
go
to
the
interment
.
 
<EOS>
She
long
,
poor
thing
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
to
cry
alone
over
the
grave
of
the
dear
father
to
whom
she
have
be
all
in
all
,
and
to
give
way
,
for
one
little
half
-
hour
,
uninterrupted
by
sympathy
and
unobserved
by
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
that
afternoon
Miss
Jenkyns
send
out
for
a
yard
of
black
crape
,
and
employ
herself
busily
in
trim
the
little
black
silk
bonnet
I
have
speak
about
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
finish
she
put
it
on
,
and
look
at
us
for
approbation
 
admiration
she
despise
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
full
of
sorrow
,
but
,
by
one
of
those
whimsical
thought
which
come
unbidden
into
our
head
,
in
time
of
deep
grief
,
I
no
sooner
see
the
bonnet
than
I
be
remind
of
a
helmet
;
and
in
that
hybrid
bonnet
,
half
helmet
,
half
jockey
-
cap
,
do
Miss
Jenkyns
attend
Captain
Brown
's
funeral
,
and
,
I
believe
,
support
Miss
Jessie
with
a
tender
,
indulgent
firmness
which
be
invaluable
,
allow
her
to
weep
her
passionate
fill
before
they
leave
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
,
Miss
Matty
,
and
I
,
meanwhile
attend
to
Miss
Brown
:
and
hard
work
we
find
it
to
relieve
her
querulous
and
never
-
end
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
we
be
so
weary
and
dispirited
,
what
must
miss
Jessie
have
be
!
 
<EOS>
yet
she
come
back
almost
calm
as
if
she
have
gain
a
new
strength
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
off
her
mourning
dress
,
and
come
in
,
look
pale
and
gentle
,
thank
us
each
with
a
soft
long
pressure
of
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
even
smile
 
a
faint
,
sweet
,
wintry
smile
 
as
if
to
reassure
us
of
her
power
to
endure
;
but
her
look
make
our
eye
fill
suddenly
with
tear
,
more
than
if
she
have
cry
outright
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
settle
that
Miss
Pole
be
to
remain
with
her
all
the
watch
livelong
night
;
and
that
Miss
Matty
and
I
be
to
return
in
the
morning
to
relieve
them
,
and
give
Miss
Jessie
the
opportunity
for
a
few
hour
of
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
the
morning
come
,
Miss
Jenkyns
appear
at
the
breakfast
-
table
,
equip
in
her
helmet
-
bonnet
,
and
order
Miss
Matty
to
stay
at
home
,
as
she
mean
to
go
and
help
to
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
evidently
in
a
state
of
great
friendly
excitement
,
which
she
show
by
eat
her
breakfast
standing
,
and
scold
the
household
all
round
.
  
<EOS>
no
nursing
 
<EOS>
no
energetic
strong
-
minded
woman
could
help
Miss
Brown
now
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
that
in
the
room
as
we
enter
which
be
strong
than
us
all
,
and
make
us
shrink
into
solemn
awestruck
helplessness
.
<EOS>
Miss
Brown
be
die
.
 
<EOS>
We
hardly
know
her
voice
,
it
be
so
devoid
of
the
complaining
tone
we
have
always
associate
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
tell
me
afterwards
that
it
,
and
her
face
too
,
be
just
what
they
have
be
formerly
,
when
her
mother
's
death
leave
her
the
young
anxious
head
of
the
family
,
of
whom
only
Miss
Jessie
survive
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
conscious
of
her
sister
's
presence
,
though
not
,
I
think
,
of
ours
.
 
<EOS>
We
stand
a
little
behind
the
curtain
:
 
Miss
Jessie
kneel
with
her
face
near
her
sister
's
,
in
order
to
catch
the
last
soft
awful
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Jessie
!
 
<EOS>
Jessie
!
 
<EOS>
how
selfish
I

"
hush

say
Miss

sob

<EOS>
"
and
my

<EOS>
I
will
not

strength
to
be
patient

<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
Jessie
!
<EOS>
tell
my
father
how
I
long
and
yearn
to
see
him
at
last
,
and
to
ask
his
forgiveness
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
never
know
now
how
I
love
him
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
may
but
tell
him
,
before
I
die
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
life
of
sorrow
his
have
be
,
and
I
have
do
so
little
to
cheer
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
a
light
come
into
Miss
Jessie
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
it
comfort
you
,
dear
,
to
think
that

<EOS>
would

H

steady
it
into
calmness
 
<EOS>
"
Mary

place
where

He

now
how

"
  
<EOS>
a
strange
look
,
which
be
not
distress
,
come
over
Miss
Brown
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
speak
for
come
time
,
but
then
we
see
her
lip
form
the
word
,
rather
than
hear
the
sound
 
"
Father
,
mother
,
Harry
,
Archy
;
"
 
then
,
as
if
it
be
a
new
idea
throw
a
filmy
shadow
over
her
darken
mind
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
be
alone

Jessie

"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
have
be
feel
this
all
during
the
silence
,
I
think
;
for
the
tear
roll
down
her
cheek
like
rain
,
at
these
word
,
and
she
could
not
answer
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
put
her
hand
together
tight
,
and
lift
them
up
,
and
say
 
but
not
to
us
 
"
<EOS>
though
He
slay
me
,
yet
will
I
trust
in
Him

"
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
moment
more
Miss
Brown
lie
calm
and
still
 
never
to
sorrow
or
murmur
more

<EOS>
after
this
second
funeral
,
Miss
Jenkyns
insist
that
Miss
Jessie
should
come
to
stay
with
her
rather
than
go
back
to
the
desolate
house
,
which
,
in
fact
,
we
learn
from
Miss
Jessie
,
must
now
be
give
up
,
as
she
have
not
wherewithal
to
maintain
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
something
above
twenty
pound
a
year
,
besides
the
interest
of
the
money
for
which
the
furniture
would
sell
;
but
she
could
not
live
upon
that
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
we
talk
over
her
qualification
for
earn
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
sew
neatly
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
I
like
nursing
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
too
<EOS>
,
I
could
manage
a
house
,
if
any
one
would
try
me
as
housekeeper
;
or
I
would
go
into
a
shop
as
saleswoman
,
if
they
would
have
patience
with
me
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
declare
,
in
an
angry
voice
,
that
she
should
do
no
such
thing
;
and
talk
to
herself
about
"
some
people
have
no
idea
of
their
rank
as
a
captain
's
daughter
,
"
nearly
an
hour
afterwards
,
when
she
bring
Miss
Jessie
up
a
basin
of
delicately
-
make
arrowroot
,
and
stand
over
her
like
a
dragoon
until
the
last
spoonful
be
finish
:
 
then
she
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
begin
to
tell
me
some
more
of
the
plan
which
have
suggest
themselves
to
her
,
and
insensibly
fall
into
talking
of
the
day
that
be
past
and
go
,
and
interest
me
so
much
I
neither
know
nor
heed
how
time
pass
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
both
startled
when
Miss
Jenkyns
reappear
,
and
catch
us
cry
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
lest
she
would
be
displease
,
as
she
often
say
that
cry
hinder
digestion
,
and
I
know
she
want
Miss
Jessie
to
get
strong
;
but
,
instead
,
she
look
queer
and
excited
,
and
fidget
round
us
without
say
anything
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
so
much
startled
 
<EOS>

I

"
     
Miss
Jessie
go
very
white
,
then
flush
scarlet
,
and
look
eagerly
at
Miss
Jenkyns
.
  
<EOS>
"

Miss

and
get
no
farther
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
his
card

"
say
Miss
Jenkyns
,
give
it
to
Miss
Jessie
;
and
while
her
head
be
bent
over
it
,
Miss
Jenkyns
go
through
a
series
of
winks
and
odd
face
to
me
,
and
form
her
lip
into
a
long
sentence
,
of
which
,
of
course
,
I
could
not
understand
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
he
come
up
?
"
ask
Miss
Jenkyns
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
certainly
!
"
say
Miss
Jessie
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
this
be
your
house
,
you
may
show
any
visitor
where
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
up
some
knitting
of
Miss
Matty
's
and
begin
to
be
very
busy
,
though
I
could
see
how
she
tremble
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
ring
the
bell
,
and
tell
the
servant
who
answer
it
to
show
Major
Gordon
upstairs
;
and
,
presently
,
in
walk
a
tall
,
fine
,
frank
-
looking
man
of
forty
or
upward
.
 
<EOS>
He
shake
hand
with
Miss
Jessie
;
but
he
could
not
see
her
eye
,
she
keep
them
so
fixed
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
ask
me
if
I
would
come
and
help
her
to
tie
up
the
preserve
in
the
store
-
room
;
and
though
Miss
Jessie
pluck
at
my
gown
,
and
even
look
up
at
me
with
beg
eye
,
I
durst
not
refuse
to
go
where
Miss
Jenkyns
ask
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
tie
up
preserve
in
the
store
-
room
,
however
,
we
go
to
talk
in
the
dining
-
room
;
and
there
Miss
Jenkyns
tell
me
what
Major
Gordon
have
tell
her
;
how
he
have
serve
in
the
same
regiment
with
Captain
Brown
,
and
have
become
acquaint
with
Miss
Jessie
,
then
a
sweet
-
looking
,
bloom
girl
of
eighteen
;
how
the
acquaintance
have
grow
into
love
on
his
part
,
though
it
have
be
some
year
before
he
have
speak

how

though
with
so
much
agitation
and
evident
distress
that
he
be
sure
she
be
not
indifferent
to
him
;
and
how
he
have
discover
that
the
obstacle
be
the
fell
disease
which
be

even
then
,
too
surely
threaten
her
sister

<EOS>
She
have
mention
that
the
surgeon
foretold
intense
suffering
;
and
there
be
no
one
but
herself
to
nurse
her
poor
Mary
,
or
cheer
and
comfort
her
father
during
the
time
of
illness

<EOS>
They

and
on
her

herself
to

a

AFFAIR
of
long
ago
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
probably
my
connection
with
Cranford
would
cease
after
Miss
Jenkyns
's
death
;
at
least
,
that
it
would
have
to
be
keep
up
by
correspondence
,
which
bear
much
the
same
relation
to
personal
intercourse
that
the
book
of
dry
plant
I
sometimes
see
(
"
Hortus
Siccus
,
"
I
think
they
call
the
thing
)
do
to
the
living
and
fresh
flower
in
the
line
and
meadow
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
pleasantly
surprised
,
therefore
,
by
receive
a
letter
from
Miss
Pole
(
who
have
always
come
in
for
a
supplementary
week
after
my
annual
visit
to
Miss
Jenkyns
)
propose
that
I
should
go
and
stay
with
her
;
and
then
,
in
a
couple
of
day
after
my
acceptance
,
come
a
note
from
Miss
Matty
,
in
which
,
in
a
rather
circuitous
and
very
humble
manner
,
she
tell
me
how
much
pleasure
I
should
confer
if
I
could
spend
a
week
or
two
with
her
,
either
before
or
after
I
have
be
at
Miss
Pole
's
;
"
for
,
<EOS>
"
she
say
,
"
since
my
dear
sister
's
death
I
be
well
aware
I
have
no
attraction
to
offer
;
it
be
only
to
the
kindness
of
my
friend
that
I
can
owe
their
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
I
promise
to
come
to
dear
Miss
Matty
as
soon
as
I
have
end
my
visit
to
Miss
Pole
;
and
the
day
after
my
arrival
at
Cranford
<EOS>
I
go
to
see
her
,
much
wonder
what
the
house
would
be
like
without
Miss
Jenkyns
,
and
rather
dread
the
change
aspect
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
begin
to
cry
as
soon
as
she
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
evidently
nervous
from
have
anticipate
my
call
.
 
<EOS>
I
comfort
her
as
well
as
I
could
;
and
I
find
the
good
consolation
I
could
give
be
the
honest
praise
that
come
from
my
heart
as
I
speak
of
the
deceased
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
slowly
shake
her
head
over
each
virtue
as
it
be
name
and
attribute
to
her
sister
;
and
at
last
she
could
not
restrain
the
tear
which
have
long
be
silently
flow
,
but
hide
her
face
behind
her
handkerchief
and
sob
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Matty
,
"
say
I
,
take
her
hand
 
for
indeed
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
in
what
way
to
tell
her
how
sorry
I
be
for
her
,
leave
desert
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
down
her
handkerchief
and
say
     
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
I
would
<EOS>
rather
you
do
not
call
me
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
like
it
;
but
I
do
many
a
thing
she
do
not
like
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
 
<EOS>
and
now
she
be
go
!
 
<EOS>
if
you
please
,
my
love
,
will
you
call
me
Matilda
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
promise
faithfully
,
and
begin
to
practise
the
new
name
with
Miss
Pole
that
very
day
;
and
,
by
degree
,
<EOS>
Miss
Matilda
's
feeling
on
the
subject
be
know
through
Cranford
,
and
we
all
try
to
drop
the
more
familiar
name
,
but
with
so
little
success
that
by
-
and
-
by
we
give
up
the
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
My
visit
to
Miss
Pole
be
very
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
have
so
long
take
the
lead
in
Cranford
that
now
she
be
go
,
they
hardly
know
how
to
give
a
party
.
 
<EOS>
the
honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
,
to
whom
Miss
Jenkyns
herself
have
always
yield
the
post
of
honour
,
be
fat
and
inert
,
and
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
her
old
servant
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
choose
that
she
should
give
a
party
,
they
remind
her
of
the
necessity
for
so
do
:
 
if
not
,
she
let
it
alone
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
all
the
more
time
for
me
to
hear
old
-
world
story
from
Miss
Pole
,
while
she
sit
knit
,
and
I
make
my
father
's
shirt
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
take
a
quantity
of
plain
sewing
to
Cranford
;
for
,
as
we
do
not
read
much
,
or
walk
much
,
I
find
it
a
capital
time
to
get
through
my
work
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
Miss
Pole
's
story
relate
to
a
shadow
of
a
love
affair
that
be
dimly
perceive
or
suspect
long
year
before
.
  
<EOS>
presently
,
the
time
arrive
when
I
be
to
remove
to
Miss
Matilda
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
her
timid
and
anxious
about
the
arrangement
for
my
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
many
a
time
,
while
I
be
unpack
,
do
she
come
backwards
and
forwards
to
stir
the
fire
which
burn
all
the
bad
for
be
so
frequently
poke
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
drawer
enough
,
dear
?
"
<EOS>
ask
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
exactly
how
my
sister
use
to
arrange
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
capital
method
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
would
have
train
a
servant
in
a
week
to
make
a
well
fire
than
this
,
and
Fanny
have
be
with
me
four
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
subject
of
servant
be
a
stand
grievance
,
and
I
could
not
wonder
much
at
it
;
for
if
gentleman
be
scarce
,
and
almost
unheard
of
in
the
"
genteel
society
"
of
Cranford
,
they
or
their
counterpart
 
handsome
young
man
 
abound
in
the
low
class
.
<EOS>
the
pretty
neat
servant
-
maid
have
their
choice
of
desirable
"
follower
"
;
and
their
mistress
,
without
have
the
sort
of
mysterious
dread
of
man
and
matrimony
that
Miss
Matilda
have
,
may
well
feel
a
little
anxious
lest
the
head
of
their
comely
maid
should
be
turn
by
the
joiner
,
or
the
butcher
,
or
the
gardener

who
be
oblige
,
by
their
calling
,
to
come
to
the
house
,
and
who
,
as
ill

luck
would
have
it

be

handsome

<EOS>
Fanny
's
lover
,
if
she
have
any
 
and
Miss
Matilda
suspect
her
of
so
many
flirtation
that
,
if
she
have
not
be
very
pretty
,
I
should
have
doubt
her
have
one
 
be
a
constant
anxiety
to
her
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
forbid
,
by
the
article
of
her
engagement
,
to
have
"
follower
"
;
and
though
she
have
answer
,
innocently
enough
,
double
up
the
hem
of
her
apron
as
she
speak
,
"
please
,
madam
,
I
never
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
,
"
Miss
Matty
prohibit
that
one
.
<EOS>
but
a
vision
of
a
man
seem
to
haunt
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
assure
me
that
it
be
all
fancy
,
or
else
<EOS>
I
should
have
say
myself
that
I
have
see
a
man
's
coat
-
tail
whisk
into
the
scullery
once
,
when
I
go
on
an
errand
into
the
store
-
room
at
night
;
and
another
evening
,
when
,
our
watch
have
stop
,
I
go
to
look
at
the
clock
,
there
be
a
very
odd
appearance
,
singularly
like
a
young
man
squeeze
up
between
the
clock
and
the
back
of
the
open
kitchen
-
door
:
and
I
think
Fanny
snatch
up
the
candle
very
hastily
,
so
as
to
throw
the
shadow
on
the
clock
face
,
while
she
very
positively
tell
me
the
time
half
-
an
-
hour
too
early
,
as
we
find
out
afterwards
by
the
church
clock
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
add
to
Miss
Matty
's
anxiety
by
name
my
suspicion
,
especially
as
Fanny
say
to
me
,
the
next
day
,
that
it
be
such
a
queer
kitchen
for
have
odd
shadow
about
it
<EOS>
,
she
really
be
almost
afraid
to
stay
;
"
for
you
know
,
miss
,
"
she
add
,
"
I
do
not
see
a
creature
from
six
o'clock
tea
,
till
Missus
ring
the
bell
for
prayer
at
ten
.
"
  
<EOS>
however
,
it
so
fall
out
that
Fanny
have
to
leave
and
Miss
Matilda
beg
me
to
stay
and
"
settle
her
"
with
the
new
maid
;
to
which
I
consent
,
after
I
have
hear
from
my
father
that
he
do
not
want
me
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
new
servant
be
a
rough
,
honest
-
looking
,
country
girl
,
who
have
only
live
in
a
farm
place
before
;
but
I
like
her
look
when
she
come
to
be
hire
;
and
I
promise
Miss
Matilda
to
put
her
in
the
way
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
say
way
be
religiously
such
as
Miss
Matilda
think
her
sister
would
approve
.
 
<EOS>
many
a
domestic
rule
and
regulation
have
be
a
subject
of
plaintive
whisper
murmur
to
me
during
Miss
Jenkyns
's
life
;
but
now
that
she
be
go
,
I
do
not
think
that
even
I
,
who
be
a
favourite
,
durst
have
suggest
an
alteration
.
 
<EOS>
to
give
an
instance
:
 
<EOS>
we
constantly
adhere
to
the
form
which
be
observe
,
at
meal
-
time
,
in
"
my
father
,
the
rector
's
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
we
have
always
wine
and
dessert
;
but
the
decanter
be
only
fill
when
there
be
a
party
,
and
what
remain
be
seldom
touch
,
though
we
have
two
wine
-
glass
apiece
every
day
after
dinner
,
until
the
next
festive
occasion
arrive
,
when
the
state
of
the
remainder
wine
be
examine
into
in
a
family
council
.
 
<EOS>
the
dreg
be
often
give
to
the
poor
:
but
occasionally
,
when
a
good
deal
have
be
leave
at
the
last
party
(
five
month
ago
,
it
may
be
)
,
it
be
add
to
some
of
a
fresh
bottle
,
bring
up
from
the
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
poor
Captain
Brown
do
not
much
like
wine
,
for
I
notice
he
never
finish
his
first
glass
,
and
most
military
man
take
several
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
to
our
dessert
,
Miss
Jenkyns
use
to
gather
currant
and
gooseberry
for
it
herself
,
which
I
sometimes
think
would
have
taste
better
fresh
from
the
tree
;
but
then
,
as
Miss
Jenkyns
observe
,
there
would
have
be
nothing
for
dessert
in
summer
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
we
feel
very
genteel
with
our
two
glass
apiece
,
and
a
dish
of
gooseberry
at
the
top
,
of
currant
and
biscuit
at
the
side
,
and
two
decanter
at
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
when
orange
come
in
,
a
curious
proceeding
be
go
through
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
do
not
like
to
cut
the
fruit
;
for
,
as
she
observe
,
the
juice
all
run
out
<EOS>
nobody
know
where
;
suck
(
only
I
think
she
use
some
more
recondite
word
)
be
in
fact
the
only
way
of
enjoy
orange
;
but
then
there
be
the
unpleasant
association
with
a
ceremony
frequently
go
through
by
little
baby
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
after
dessert
,
in
orange
season
,
Miss
Jenkyns
and
Miss
Matty
use
to
rise
up
,
possess
themselves
each
of
an
orange
in
silence
,
and
withdraw
to
the
privacy
of
their
own
room
to
indulge
in
suck
orange
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
once
or
twice
try
,
on
such
occasion
,
to
prevail
on
Miss
Matty
to
stay
,
and
have
succeed
in
her
sister
's
lifetime
.
 
<EOS>
I
hold
up
a
screen
,
and
do
not
look
,
and
,
as
she
say
,
she
try
not
to
make
the
noise
very
offensive
;
but
now
that
she
be
leave
alone
,
she
seem
quite
horrified
when
I
beg
her
to
remain
with
me
in
the
warm
dining
-
parlour
,
and
enjoy
her
orange
as
she
like
best
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
in
everything
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
's
rule
be
make
more
stringent
than
ever
,
because
the
framer
of
them
be
go
where
there
could
be
no
appeal
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
thing
else
<EOS>
Miss
Matilda
be
meek
and
undecided
to
a
fault
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
Fanny
turn
her
round
twenty
time
in
a
morning
about
dinner
,
just
as
the
little
hussy
choose
;
and
I
sometimes
fancy
she
work
on
Miss
Matilda
's
weakness
in
order
to
bewilder
her
,
and
to
make
her
feel
more
in
the
power
of
her
clever
servant
.
 
<EOS>
I
determine
that
I
would
not
leave
her
till
I
have
see
what
sort
of
a
person
Martha
be
;
and
,
if
I
find
her
trustworthy
,
I
would
tell
her
not
to
trouble
her
mistress
with
every
little
decision
.
  
<EOS>
Martha
be
blunt
and
plain
-
spoken
to
a
fault
;
otherwise
she
be
a
brisk
,
well
-
mean
,
but
very
ignorant
girl
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
with
us
a
week
before
Miss
Matilda
<EOS>
and
I
be
astounded
one
morning
by
the
receipt
of
a
letter
from
a
cousin
of
her
,
who
have
be
twenty
or
thirty
year
in
India
,
and
who
have
lately
,
as
we
have
see
by
the
"
Army
List
,
"
return
to
England
,
bring
with
him
an
invalid
wife
who
have
never
be
introduce
to
her
english
relation
.
 
<EOS>
Major
Jenkyns
write
to
propose
that
he
and
his
wife
should
spend
a
night
at
Cranford
,
on
his
way
to
Scotland
 
at
the
inn
,
if
it
do
not
suit
Miss
Matilda
to
receive
them
into
her
house
;
in
which
case
they
should
hope
to
be
with
her
as
much
as
possible
during
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
it
MUST
suit
her
,
as
she
say
;
for
all
Cranford
know
that
she
have
her
sister
's
bedroom
at
liberty
;
but
I
be
sure
she
wish
the
Major
have
stop
in
India
and
forget
his
cousin
out
and
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
must
I
manage
?
"
<EOS>
ask
she
helplessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
Deborah
have
be
alive
she
would
have
know
what
to
do
with
a
gentleman
-
visitor
.
<EOS>
Must
I
put
razor
in
his
dressing
-
room
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
!
<EOS>
dear
!
<EOS>
and
I
have
get
none
.
 
<EOS>
Deborah
would
have
have
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
slipper
,
and
coat
-
brush
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
suggest
that
probably
he
would
bring
all
these
thing
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
after
dinner
,
how
be
I
to
know
when
to
get
up
and
leave
him
to
his
wine
?
 
<EOS>
Deborah
would
have
do
it
so
well
;
she
would
have
be
quite
in
her
element
.
 
<EOS>
Will
he
want
coffee
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
undertake
the
management
of
the
coffee
,
and
tell
her
I
would
instruct
Martha
in
the
art
of
wait
 
in
which
it
must
be
own
<EOS>
she
be
terribly
deficient
 
and
that
I
have
no
doubt
major
and
Mrs
Jenkyns
would
understand
the
quiet
mode
in
which
a
lady
live
by
herself
in
a
country
town
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
sadly
flutter
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
her
empty
her
decanter
and
bring
up
two
fresh
bottle
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
have
prevent
her
from
be
present
at
my
instruction
to
Martha
,
for
she
frequently
cut
in
with
some
fresh
direction
,
muddle
the
poor
girl
's
mind
as
she
stand
open
-
mouthed
,
listen
to
us
both
.
  
<EOS>
"
hand
the
vegetable
round
,
"
say
I
(
foolishly
,
I
see
now
 
for
it
be
aim
at
more
than
we
could
accomplish
with
quietness
and
simplicity
)
;
and
then
,
see
her
look
bewilder
,
I
add
,
"
take
the
vegetable
round
to
people
,
and
let
them
help
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
mind
you
go
first
to
the
lady
,
"
put
in
Miss
Matilda
.
<EOS>
"
always
go
to
the
lady
before
gentleman
when
you
be
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
it
as
you
tell
me
,
madam
,
"
say
Martha
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
like
lad
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
feel
very
uncomfortable
and
shocked
at
this
speech
of
Martha
's
,
yet
I
do
not
think
she
mean
any
harm
;
and
,
on
the
whole
,
she
attend
very
well
to
our
direction
,
except
that
she
"
nudge
"
the
Major
when
he
do
not
help
himself
as
soon
as
she
expect
to
the
potato
,
while
she
be
hand
them
round
.
  
<EOS>
the
major
and
his
wife
be
quiet
unpretending
people
enough
when
they
do
come
;
languid
,
as
all
East
Indians
be
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
rather
dismay
at
their
bring
two
servant
with
them
,
a
Hindoo
body
-
servant
for
the
Major
,
and
a
steady
elderly
maid
for
his
wife
;
but
they
sleep
at
the
inn
,
and
take
off
a
good
deal
of
the
responsibility
by
attend
carefully
to
their
master
's
and
mistress
's
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
,
to
be
sure
,
have
never
end
her
staring
at
the
East
Indian
's
white
turban
and
brown
complexion
,
and
I
see
that
Miss
Matilda
shrink
away
from
him
a
little
as
he
wait
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
ask
me
,
when
they
be
go
,
if
he
do
not
remind
me
of
Blue
Beard
?
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
the
visit
be
most
satisfactory
,
and
be
a
subject
of
conversation
even
now
with
Miss
Matilda
;
at
the
time
it
greatly
excite
Cranford
,
and
even
stir
up
the
apathetic
and
honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
to
some
expression
of
interest
,
when
I
go
to
call
and
thank
her
for
the
kind
answer
she
have
vouchsafe
to
Miss
Matilda
's
inquiry
as
to
the
arrangement
of
a
gentleman
's
dressing
-
room
 
answer
which
I
must
confess
she
have
give
in
the
wearied
manner
of
the
scandinavian
prophetess
     
"
leave
me
,
leave
me
to
repose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
come
to
the
love
affair
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
that
Miss
Pole
have
a
cousin
,
once
or
twice
remove
,
who
have
offer
to
Miss
Matty
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
now
this
cousin
live
four
or
five
mile
from
Cranford
on
his
own
estate
;
but
his
property
be
not
large
enough
to
entitle
him
to
rank
high
than
a
yeoman
;
or
rather
,
with
something
of
the
"
pride
which
ape
humility
,
"
he
have
refuse
to
push
himself
on
,
as
so
many
of
his
class
have
do
,
into
the
rank
of
the
squire
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
call
Thomas
Holbrook
,
ESQ
.
<EOS>
;
he
even
send
back
letter
with
this
address
,
tell
the
post
-
mistress
at
Cranford
that
his
name
be
MR
Thomas
Holbrook
,
yeoman
.
 
<EOS>
He
reject
all
domestic
innovation
;
he
would
have
the
house
door
stand
open
in
summer
and
shut
in
winter
,
without
knocker
or
bell
to
summon
a
servant
.
 
<EOS>
the
closed
fist
or
the
knob
of
a
stick
do
this
office
for
him
if
he
find
the
door
lock
.
 
<EOS>
He
despise
every
refinement
which
have
not
its
root
deep
down
in
humanity
.
 
<EOS>
if
people
be
not
ill
,
he
see
no
necessity
for
moderate
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
the
dialect
of
the
country
in
perfection
,
and
constantly
use
it
in
conversation
;
although
Miss
Pole
(
who
give
me
these
particular
)
add
,
that
he
read
aloud
more
beautifully
and
with
more
feeling
than
any
one
she
have
ever
hear
,
except
the
late
rector
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
come
Miss
Matilda
not
to
marry
him
?
"
ask
I.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
willing
enough
,
I
think
;
but
you
know
Cousin
Thomas
would
not
have
be
enough
of
a
gentleman
for
the
rector
and
Miss
Jenkyns
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
but
they
be
not
to
marry
him
,
"
say
I
,
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
but
they
do
not
like
Miss
Matty
to
marry
below
her
rank
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
she
be
the
rector
's
daughter
,
and
somehow
they
be
relate
to
Sir
Peter
Arley
:
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
think
a
deal
of
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Miss
Matty
!
"
say
I.
  
"
Nay
,
now
,
I
do
not
know
anything
more
than
that
he
offer
and
be
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
may
not
like
him
 
and
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
may
never
have
say
a
word
 
<EOS>
it
be
only
a
guess
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
she
never
see
him
since
?
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
Woodley
,
Cousin
Thomas
's
house
,
lie
half
-
way
between
Cranford
and
Misselton
;
and
I
know
he
make
Misselton
his
market
-
town
very
soon
after
he
have
offer
to
Miss
Matty
;
and
I
do
not
think
he
have
be
into
Cranford
above
once
or
twice
since
 
once
,
when
I
be
walk
with
Miss
Matty
,
in
High
Street
,
and
suddenly
she
dart
from
me
,
and
go
up
Shire
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
minute
after
I
be
startle
by
meet
Cousin
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
old
be
he
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
after
a
pause
of
castle
-
building
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
about
seventy
,
I
think
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Miss
Pole
,
blow
up
my
castle
,
as
if
by
gun
-
powder
,
into
small
fragment
.
  
<EOS>
very
soon
after
 
at
least
during
my
long
visit
to
Miss
Matilda
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
opportunity
of
see
Mr
Holbrook
;
see
,
too
,
his
first
encounter
with
his
former
love
,
after
thirty
or
forty
year
'
separation
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
help
to
decide
whether
any
of
the
new
assortment
of
coloured
silk
which
they
have
just
receive
at
the
shop
would
do
to
match
a
grey
and
black
mousseline
-
delaine
that
want
a
new
breadth
,
when
a
tall
,
thin
,
Don
Quixote
-
look
old
man
come
into
the
shop
for
some
woollen
glove
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
the
person
(
who
be
rather
striking
)
before
,
and
I
watch
him
rather
attentively
while
Miss
Matty
listen
to
the
shopman
.
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
wear
a
blue
coat
with
brass
button
,
drab
breech
,
and
gaiter
,
and
drum
with
his
finger
on
the
counter
until
he
be
attend
to
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
answer
the
shop
-
boy
's
question
,
"
what
can
I
have
the
pleasure
of
show
you
to
-
day
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
see
Miss
Matilda
start
,
and
then
suddenly
sit
down
;
and
instantly
I
guess
who
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
make
some
inquiry
which
have
to
be
carry
round
to
the
other
shopman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Jenkyns
want
the
black
sarsenet
two
-
and
-
twopence
the
yard
"
;
and
Mr
Holbrook
have
catch
the
name
,
and
be
across
the
shop
in
two
stride
.
  
<EOS>
"
Matty
 
Miss
Matilda
 
Miss
Jenkyns
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
know
you
.
 
<EOS>
how
be
you
?
<EOS>
how
be
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
keep
shake
her
hand
in
a
way
which
prove
the
warmth
of
his
friendship
;
but
he
repeat
so
often
,
as
if
to
himself
,
"
I
should
not
have
know
you
!
"
<EOS>
that
any
sentimental
romance
which
I
may
be
incline
to
build
be
quite
do
away
with
by
his
manner
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
he
keep
talk
to
us
all
the
time
we
be
in
the
shop
;
and
then
wave
the
shopman
with
the
unpurchased
glove
on
one
side
,
with
"
another
time
,
sir
!
<EOS>
another
time
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
walk
home
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
happy
to
say
my
client
,
Miss
Matilda
,
also
leave
the
shop
in
an
equally
bewilder
state
,
not
have
purchase
either
green
or
red
silk
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Holbrook
be
evidently
full
with
honest
loud
-
spoken
joy
at
meet
his
old
love
again
;
he
touch
on
the
change
that
have
take
place
;
he
even
speak
of
Miss
Jenkyns
as
"
Your
poor
sister
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
well
!
<EOS>
we
have
all
our
fault
"
;
and
bade
us
good
-
bye
with
many
a
hope
that
he
should
soon
see
Miss
Matty
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
straight
to
her
room
,
and
never
come
back
till
our
early
tea
-
time
,
when
I
think
she
look
as
if
she
have
be
cry
.
   
<EOS>
a
visit
to
an
old
BACHELOR
 
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
,
a
note
come
from
Mr
Holbrook
,
ask
us
 
impartially
ask
both
of
us
 
in
a
formal
,
old
-
fashioned
style
,
to
spend
a
day
at
his
house
 
a
long
June
day
 
for
it
be
June
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
name
that
he
have
also
invite
his
cousin
,
Miss
Pole
;
so
that
we
may
join
in
a
fly
,
which
could
be
put
up
at
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
expect
Miss
Matty
to
jump
at
this
invitation
;
but
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
<EOS>
and
I
have
the
great
difficulty
in
persuade
her
to
go
.
<EOS>
She
think
it
be
improper
;
and
be
even
half
annoyed
when
we
utterly
ignore
the
idea
of
any
impropriety
in
her
go
with
two
other
lady
to
see
her
old
lover
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
a
more
serious
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
think
Deborah
would
have
like
her
to
go
.
<EOS>
this
take
us
half
a
day
's
good
hard
talk
to
get
over
;
but
,
at
the
first
sentence
of
relent
,
I
seize
the
opportunity
,
and
write
and
despatch
an
acceptance
in
her
name
 
fix
day
and
hour
,
that
all
may
be
decide
and
do
with
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
she
ask
me
if
I
would
go
down
to
the
shop
with
her
;
and
there
,
after
much
hesitation
,
we
choose
out
three
cap
to
be
send
home
and
try
on
,
that
the
most
become
may
be
select
to
take
with
us
on
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
state
of
silent
agitation
all
the
way
to
Woodley
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
evidently
never
be
there
before
;
and
,
although
she
little
dreamt
<EOS>
I
know
anything
of
her
early
story
,
I
could
perceive
she
be
in
a
tremor
at
the
thought
of
see
the
place
which
may
have
be
her
home
,
and
round
which
it
be
probable
that
many
of
her
innocent
girlish
imagination
have
cluster
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
drive
there
,
through
pave
jolt
lane
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matilda
sit
bolt
upright
,
and
look
wistfully
out
of
the
window
as
we
draw
near
the
end
of
our
journey
.
 
<EOS>
the
aspect
of
the
country
be
quiet
and
pastoral
.
<EOS>
Woodley
stand
among
field
;
and
there
be
an
old
-
fashioned
garden
where
rose
and
currant
-
bush
touch
each
other
,
and
where
the
feathery
asparagus
form
a
pretty
background
to
the
pink
and
gilly
-
flower
;
there
be
no
drive
up
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
We
get
out
at
a
little
gate
,
and
walk
up
a
straight
box
-
edge
path
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
may
make
a
drive
,
I
think
,
"
say
Miss
Pole
,
who
be
afraid
of
ear
-
ache
,
and
have
only
her
cap
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
very
pretty
,
"
say
Miss
Matty
,
with
a
soft
plaintiveness
in
her
voice
,
and
almost
in
a
whisper
,
for
<EOS>
just
then
Mr
Holbrook
appear
at
the
door
,
rub
his
hand
in
very
effervescence
of
hospitality
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
more
like
my
idea
of
Don
Quixote
than
ever
,
and
yet
the
likeness
be
only
external
.
 
<EOS>
His
respectable
housekeeper
stand
modestly
at
the
door
to
bid
us
welcome
;
and
,
while
she
lead
the
eld
lady
upstairs
to
a
bedroom
,
I
beg
to
look
about
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
My
request
evidently
please
the
old
gentleman
,
who
take
me
all
round
the
place
and
show
me
his
six
-
and
-
twenty
cow
,
name
after
the
different
letter
of
the
alphabet
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
go
along
,
he
surprise
me
occasionally
by
repeat
apt
and
beautiful
quotation
from
the
poet
,
range
easily
from
Shakespeare
and
George
Herbert
to
those
of
our
own
day
.
<EOS>
He
do
this
as
naturally
as
if
he
be
think
aloud
,
and
their
true
and
beautiful
word
be
the
good
expression
he
could
find
for
what
he
be
think
or
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
he
call
Byron
"
my
Lord
Byrron
,
"
and
pronounce
the
name
of
Goethe
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
english
sound
of
the
letter
 
<EOS>
"
as
Goethe
say
,
"
Ye
ever
-
verdant
palace
,
"
&
c.
 
altogether
,
I
never
meet
with
a
man
,
before
or
since
,
who
have
spend
so
long
a
life
in
a
secluded
and
not
impressive
country
,
with
ever
-
increase
delight
in
the
daily
and
yearly
change
of
season
and
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
and
I
go
in
,
we
find
that
dinner
be
nearly
ready
in
the
kitchen
 
<EOS>
for
<EOS>
so
I
suppose
the
room
ought
to
be
call
,
as
there
be
oak
dresser
and
cupboard
all
round
,
all
over
by
the
side
of
the
fireplace
,
and
only
a
small
Turkey
carpet
in
the
middle
of
the
flag
-
floor
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
may
have
be
easily
make
into
a
handsome
dark
oak
dining
-
parlour
by
remove
the
oven
and
a
few
other
appurtenance
of
a
kitchen
,
which
be
evidently
never
use
,
the
real
cooking
-
place
be
at
some
distance
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
we
be
expect
to
sit
be
a
stiffly
-
furnished
,
ugly
apartment
;
but
that
in
which
we
do
sit
be
what
Mr
Holbrook
call
the
counting
-
house
,
where
he
pay
his
labourer
their
weekly
wage
at
a
great
desk
near
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
pretty
sitting
-
room
 
look
into
the
orchard
,
and
all
cover
over
with
dance
tree
-
shadow
 
be
fill
with
book
.
 
<EOS>
They
lie
on
the
ground
,
they
cover
the
wall
,
they
strew
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
half
ashamed
and
half
proud
of
his
extravagance
in
this
respect
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
of
all
kind
 
poetry
and
wild
weird
tale
prevail
.
 
<EOS>
He
evidently
choose
his
book
in
accordance
with
his
own
taste
,
not
because
such
and
such
be
classical
or
establish
favourite
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
"
we
farmer
ought
not
to
have
much
time
for
reading
;
yet
somehow
one
can
not
help
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
pretty
room
!
"
say
Miss
Matty
,
sotto
voce
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
pleasant
place
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
aloud
,
almost
simultaneously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
<EOS>
if
you
like
it
,
"
reply
he
;
"
but
can
you
sit
on
these
great
,
black
leather
,
three
-
corner
chair
?
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
better
than
the
good
parlour
;
but
I
think
lady
would
take
that
for
the
smart
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
smart
place
,
but
,
like
most
smart
thing
,
not
at
all
pretty
,
or
pleasant
,
or
home
-
like
;
so
,
while
we
be
at
dinner
,
the
servant
-
girl
dust
and
scrub
the
counting
-
house
chair
,
and
we
sit
there
all
the
rest
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
pudde
before
meat
;
and
I
think
Mr
Holbrook
be
go
to
make
some
apology
for
his
old
-
fashioned
way
,
for
he
begin
     
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
you
like
newfangled
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
,
not
at
all
!
"
say
Miss
Matty
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
more
do
I
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
house
-
keeper
WILL
have
these
in
her
new
fashion
;
or
else
I
tell
her
that
,
when
I
be
a
young
man
,
we
use
to
keep
strictly
to
my
father
's
rule
,
"
no
broth
,
no
ball
;
no
ball
,
no
beef
"
;
and
always
begin
dinner
with
broth
.
 
<EOS>
then
we
have
suet
pudding
,
boil
in
the
broth
with
the
beef
:
 
and
then
the
meat
itself
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
do
not
sup
our
broth
,
we
have
no
ball
,
which
we
like
a
deal
better
;
and
the
beef
come
last
of
all
,
and
only
those
have
it
who
have
do
justice
to
the
broth
and
the
ball
.
 
<EOS>
now
folk
begin
with
sweet
thing
,
and
turn
their
dinner
topsy
-
turvy
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
the
duck
and
green
pea
come
,
we
look
at
each
other
in
dismay
;
we
have
only
two
-
pronged
,
black
-
handle
fork
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
the
steel
be
as
bright
as
silver
;
but
what
be
we
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
pick
up
her
pea
,
one
by
one
,
on
the
point
of
the
prong
,
much
as
Amine
eat
her
grain
of
rice
after
her
previous
feast
with
the
Ghoul
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
sigh
over
her
delicate
young
pea
as
she
leave
them
on
one
side
of
her
plate
untaste
,
for
they
WOULD
drop
between
the
prong
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
my
host
:
 
<EOS>
the
pea
be
go
wholesale
into
his
capacious
mouth
,
shovel
up
by
his
large
round
-
end
knife
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
I
imitate
,
I
survive
!
 
<EOS>
My
friend
,
in
spite
of
my
precedent
,
could
not
muster
up
courage
enough
to
do
an
ungenteel
thing
;
and
,
if
Mr
Holbrook
have
not
be
so
heartily
hungry
,
he
would
probably
have
see
that
the
good
pea
go
away
almost
untouched
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
a
clay
pipe
be
bring
in
,
and
a
spittoon
;
and
,
ask
us
to
retire
to
another
room
,
where
he
would
soon
join
us
,
if
we
dislike
tobacco
-
smoke
,
he
present
his
pipe
to
Miss
Matty
,
and
request
her
to
fill
the
bowl
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
compliment
to
a
lady
in
his
youth
;
but
it
be
rather
inappropriate
to
propose
it
as
an
honour
to
Miss
Matty
,
who
have
be
train
by
her
sister
to
hold
smoking
of
every
kind
in
utter
abhorrence
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
a
shock
to
her
refinement
,
it
be
also
a
gratification
to
her
feeling
to
be
thus
select
;
so
she
daintily
stuff
the
strong
tobacco
into
the
pipe
,
and
then
we
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
pleasant
dining
with
a
bachelor
,
"
say
Miss
Matty
softly
,
as
we
settle
ourselves
in
the
counting
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
hope
it
be
not
improper
;
so
many
pleasant
thing
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
number
of
book
he
have
!
"
say
Miss
Pole
,
look
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
how
dusty
they
be
!
"

"
I
think
it
must
be
like
one
of
the
great
Dr
Johnson
's
room
,
"
say
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
a
superior
man
your
cousin
must
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
!
"
say
Miss
Pole
,
"
he
be
a
great
reader
;
but
I
be
afraid
he
have
get
into
very
uncouth
habit
with
live
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
uncouth
be
too
hard
a
word

<EOS>
I
should
call
him
eccentric
;
very
clever
people
always
be
!
"
reply
Miss
Matty
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr
Holbrook
return
,
he
propose
a
walk
in
the
field
;
but
the
two
eld
lady
be
afraid
of
damp
,
and
dirt
,
and
have
only
very
unbecoming
calash
to
put
on
over
their
cap
;
so
they
decline
,
and
I
be
again
his
companion
in
a
turn
which
he
say
he
be
oblige
to
take
to
see
after
his
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
stride
along
,
either
wholly
forget
my
existence
,
or
soothe
into
silence
by
his
pipe
 
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
not
silence
exactly
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
before
me
with
a
stoop
gait
,
his
hand
clasp
behind
him
;
and
,
as
some
tree
or
cloud
,
or
glimpse
of
distant
upland
pasture
,
strike
him
,
he
quote
poetry
to
himself
,
say
it
out
loud
in
a
grand
sonorous
voice
,
with
just
the
emphasis
that
true
feeling
and
appreciation
give
.
 
<EOS>
We
come
upon
an
old
cedar
tree
,
which
stand
at
one
end
of
the
house

the
cedar
spread
his
dark

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
he
be
speak
to
me
or
not
;
but
I
put
in
an
assent
"
wonderful
,
"
although
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
just
because
I
be
tired
of
be
forget
,

of
be
consequently
silent

<EOS>
He
turn
sharp
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
!
<EOS>
you
may
say
"
wonderful
.
"
 
<EOS>
why
,
when
I
see
the
review
of
his
poem
in
Blackwood
,
I
set
off
within
an
hour
,
and
walk
seven
mile
to
Misselton
(
for
the
horse
be
not
in
the
way
)
and
order
them
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
what
colour
be
ash
-
bud
in
March

the

I.
 
He
be
very
like

<EOS>
"
what

repeat
he
vehemently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

I

I
,
with
the
meekness
of

I

no

black
as

I
have
live
all
my

more

<EOS>
Black
:
 
<EOS>
they

black

madam

"
 
<EOS>
and
he
go
off
again
,
swinge
along
to
the
music
of
some
rhyme
he
have
get
hold
of
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
back
,
nothing
would
serve
him
but
he
must
read
us
the
poem
he
have
be
speak
of
;
and
Miss
Pole
encourage
him
in
his
proposal
,
I
think
,
because
she
wish
me
to
hear
his
beautiful
reading
,
of
which
she
have
boast
;
but
she
afterwards
say
it
be
because
she
have
get
to
a
difficult
part
of
her
crochet
,
and
want
to
count
her
stitch
without
have
to
talk
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
he
have
propose
would
have
be
right
to
Miss
Matty
;
although
she
do
fall
sound
asleep
within
five
minute
after
he
have
begin
a
long
poem
,
call
"
Locksley
Hall
,
"
and
have
a
comfortable
nap
,
unobserved
,
till
he
end
;
when
the
cessation
of
his
voice
waken
her
up
,
and
she
say
,
feel
that
something
be
expect
,
and
that
Miss
Pole
be
count
     
<EOS>
"

she
,
flutter
at
his

of

<EOS>

It
be
so

it

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

it

he
reflectively
.

I
do
not
know
Dr

poem
well

I
must
read
them

"
  
<EOS>
as
we
be
get
into
the
fly
to
return
,
I
hear
Mr
Holbrook
say
he
should
call
on
the
lady
soon
,
and
inquire
how
they
get
home
;
and
this
evidently
pleased
and
flutter
Miss
Matty
at
the
time
he
say
it
;
but
after
we
have
lose
sight
of
the
old
house
among
the
tree
<EOS>
her
sentiment
towards
the
master
of
it
be
gradually
absorb
into
a
distress
wonder
as
to
whether
Martha
have
break
her
word
,
and
seize
on
the
opportunity
of
her
mistress
's
absence
to
have
a
"
follower
.
"
 
<EOS>
Martha
look
good
,
and
steady
,
and
compose
enough
,
as
she
come
to
help
us
out
;
she
be
always
careful
of
Miss
Matty
,
and
to
-
night
she
make
use
of
this
unlucky
speech
     
"
eh
!
<EOS>
dear
madam
,
to
think
of
your
go
out
in
an
evening
in
such
a
thin
shawl
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
well
than
muslin
.
 
<EOS>
at
your
age
,
madam
,
you
should
be
careful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
age
!
"
say
Miss
Matty
,
almost
speak
crossly
,
for
her
,
for
she
be
usually
gentle
 
<EOS>
"
My
age
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
how
old
do
you
think
I
be
,
that
you
talk
about
my
age
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
madam
,
I
should
say
you
be
not
far
short
of
sixty
:
 
<EOS>
but
folk
'
look
be
often
against
them
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
I
mean
no
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Martha
,
I
be
not
yet
fifty
-
two
!
"
say
Miss
Matty
,
with
grave
emphasis
;
for
probably
the
remembrance
of
her
youth
have
come
very
vividly
before
her
this
day
,
and
she
be
annoy
at
find
that
golden
time
so
far
away
in
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
never
speak
of
any
former
and
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
Mr
Holbrook
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
probably
meet
with
so
little
sympathy
in
her
early
love
,
that
she
have
shut
it
up
close
in
her
heart
;
and
it
be
only
by
a
sort
of
watching
,
which
I
could
hardly
avoid
since
Miss
Pole
's
confidence
,
that
I
see
how
faithful
her
poor
heart
have
be
in
its
sorrow
and
its
silence
.
  
<EOS>
She
give
me
some
good
reason
for
wear
her
good
cap
every
day
,
and
sit
near
the
window
,
in
spite
of
her
rheumatism
,
in
order
to
see
,
without
be
see
,
down
into
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
his
open
palm
upon
his
knee
,
which
be
far
apart
,
as
he
sit
with
his
head
bend
down
,
whistle
,
after
we
have
reply
to
his
inquiry
about
our
safe
return
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
he
jump
up
     
"
well
,
madam
!
<EOS>
have
you
any
command
for
Paris
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
there
in
a
week
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
to
Paris
!
<EOS>
"
we
both
exclaim
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
be
there
,
and
always
have
a
wish
to
go
;
and
I
think
if
I
do
not
go
soon
,
I
may
not
go
at
all
;
so
as
soon
as
the
hay
be
get
in
I
shall
go
,
before
harvest
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
be
so
much
astonished
that
we
have
no
commission
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
he
be
go
out
of
the
room
,
he
turn
back
,
with
his
favourite
exclamation
     
<EOS>
"
God
bless
my
soul
,
madam
!
<EOS>
but
I
nearly
forget
half
my
errand
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
poem
for
you
you
admire
so
much
the
other
evening
at
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
tug
away
at
a
parcel
in
his
coat
-
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
good
-
bye
,
miss
,
"
say
he
;
"
good
-
bye
,
Matty
!
<EOS>
take
care
of
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
have
give
her
a
book
,
and
he
have
call
her
Matty
,
just
as
he
use
to
do
thirty
year
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
would
not
go
to
Paris
,
"
say
Miss
Matilda
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
frog
will
agree
with
him
;
he
use
to
have
to
be
very
careful
what
he
eat
,
which
be
curious
in
so
strong
-
look
a
young
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
soon
after
this
I
take
my
leave
,
give
many
an
injunction
to
Martha
to
look
after
her
mistress
,
and
to
let
me
know
if
she
think
that
Miss
Matilda
be
not
so
well
;
in
which
case
I
would
volunteer
a
visit
to
my
old
friend
,
without
notice
Martha
's
intelligence
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
I
receive
a
line
or
two
from
Martha
every
now
and
then
;
and
,
about
November
I
have
a
note
to
say
her
mistress
be
"
very
low
and
sadly
off
her
food
"
;
and
the
account
make
me
so
uneasy
that
,
although
Martha
do
not
decidedly
summon
me
,
I
pack
up
my
thing
and
go
.
  
<EOS>
I
receive
a
warm
welcome
,
in
spite
of
the
little
flurry
produce
by
my
impromptu
visit
,
for
I
have
only
be
able
to
give
a
day
's
notice
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matilda
look
miserably
ill
;
and
I
prepare
to
comfort
and
cosset
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
down
to
have
a
private
talk
with
Martha
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
long
have
your
mistress
be
so
poorly
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
as
I
stand
by
the
kitchen
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
its
well
than
a
fortnight
;
it
be
,
I
know
;
<EOS>
it
be
one
Tuesday
,
after
Miss
Pole
have
be
,
that
she
go
into
this
mope
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
be
tired
,
and
it
would
go
off
with
a
night
's
rest
;
but
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
she
have
go
on
and
on
ever
since
,
till
I
think
it
my
duty
to
write
to
you
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
quite
right
,
Martha
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
comfort
to
think
she
have
so
faithful
a
servant
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
you
find
your
place
comfortable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
madam
,
missus
be
very
kind
,
and
there
be
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
,
and
no
more
work
<EOS>
but
what
I
can
do
easily
 
but
"
Martha
hesitate
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
what
,
Martha
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
it
seem
so
hard
of
missus
not
to
let
me
have
any
follower
;
there
be
such
lot
of
young
fellow
in
the
town
;
and
many
a
one
have
as
much
as
offer
to
keep
company
with
me
;
and
I
may
never
be
in
such
a
likely
place
again
,
and
it
be
like
waste
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
many
a
girl
as
I
know
would
have
'em
unbeknownst
to
missus
;
but
<EOS>
I
have
give
my
word
,
and
I
will
stick
to
it
;
or
else
this
be
just
the
house
for
missus
never
to
be
the
wise
if
they
do
come
:
 
and
<EOS>
it
be
such
a
capable
kitchen
 
<EOS>
there
be
such
dark
corner
in
it
 
<EOS>
I
would
be
bind
to
hide
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
count
up
last
Sunday
night
 
for
I
will
not
deny
I
be
cry
because
I
have
to
shut
the
door
in
Jem
Hearn
's
face
,
and
he
be
a
steady
young
man
,
fit
for
any
girl
;
only
I
have
give
missus
my
word
.
"
 
<EOS>
Martha
be
all
but
cry
again
;
and
I
have
little
comfort
to
give
her
,
for
I
know
,
from
old
experience
,
of
the
horror
with
which
both
the
Miss
Jenkynses
look
upon
"
follower
"
;
and
in
Miss
Matty
's
present
nervous
state
<EOS>
this
dread
be
not
likely
to
be
lessen
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
see
Miss
Pole
the
next
day
,
and
take
her
completely
by
surprise
,
for
she
have
not
be
to
see
Miss
Matilda
for
two
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
I
must
go
back
with
you
,
my
dear
,
for
I
promise
to
let
her
know
how
Thomas
Holbrook
go
on
;
and
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
his
housekeeper
have
send
me
word
to
-
day
that
he
have
not
long
to
live
.
<EOS>
poor
Thomas
!
<EOS>
that
journey
to
Paris
be
quite
too
much
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
housekeeper
say
he
have
hardly
ever
be
round
his
field
since
,
but
just
sit
with
his
hand
on
his
knee
in
the
counting

house
,
not
read
or
anything
,
but
only
say
what
a
wonderful
city
Paris
be
!
 
<EOS>
Paris
have
much
to
answer
for
if
it
be
kill
my
cousin
Thomas

for
a
well
man
never
live

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Miss
Matilda
know
of
his
illness

<EOS>
ask
I
 
a
new
light
as
to
the
cause

her
indisposition
dawn
upon
me

not

or
more
,
when
first
I
hear
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
how
odd
she
should
not
have
tell
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
not
at
all
,
I
think
;
but
I
do
not
say
anything
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
almost
guilty
of
have
spy
too
curiously
into
that
tender
heart
,
and
I
be
not
go
to
speak
of
its
secret
 
<EOS>
hide
,
Miss
Matty
believe
,
from
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
usher
Miss
Pole
into
Miss
Matilda
's
little
drawing
-
room
,
and
then
leave
them
alone
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
surprised
when
Martha
come
to
my
bedroom
door
,
to
ask
me
to
go
down
to
dinner
alone
,
for
that
missus
<EOS>
have
one
of
her
bad
headache
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
into
the
drawing
-
room
at
tea
-
time
,
but
it
be
evidently
an
effort
to
her
;
and
,
as
if
to
make
up
for
some
reproachful
feeling
against
her
late
sister
,
Miss
Jenkyns
,
which
have
be
trouble
her
all
the
afternoon
,
and
for
which
she
now
feel
penitent
,
she
keep
tell
me
how
good
and
how
clever
Deborah
be
in
her
youth
<EOS>
;
how
she
use
to
settle
what
gown
they
be
to
wear
at
all
the
party
(
faint
,
ghostly
idea
of
grim
party
,
far
away
in
the
distance
,
when
Miss
Matty
and
Miss
Pole
be
young
!
)
<EOS>
;
and
how
Deborah
and
her
mother
have
start
the
benefit
society
for
the
poor
,
and
teach
girl
cook
and
plain
sewing
;
and
how
Deborah
have
once
dance
with
a
lord
;
and
how
she
use
to
visit
at
Sir
Peter
Arley
's
,
and
try
to
remodel
the
quiet
rectory
establishment
on
the
plan
of
Arley
Hall
,
where
they
keep
thirty
servant
;
and
how
she
have
nurse
Miss
Matty
through
a
long
,
long
illness
,
of
which
I
have
never
hear
before
,
but
which
I
now
date
in
my
own
mind
as
follow
the
dismissal
of
the
suit
of
Mr
Holbrook
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
talk
softly
and
quietly
of
old
time
through
the
long
November
evening
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
Miss
Pole
bring
us
word
that
Mr
Holbrook
be
dead
.
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
hear
the
news
in
silence
;
in
fact
,
from
the
account
of
the
previous
day
,
it
be
only
what
we
have
to
expect
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
keep
call
upon
us
for
some
expression
of
regret
,
by
ask
if
it
be
not
sad
that
he
be
go
,
and
say
     
"
to
think
of
that
pleasant
day
last
June
,
when
he
seem
so
well
!
<EOS>
and
he
may
have
live
this
dozen
year
if
he
have
not
go
to
that
wicked
Paris
,
where
they
be
always
have
revolution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
for
some
demonstration
on
our
part
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
Miss
Matty
could
not
speak
,
she
be
tremble
so
nervously
;
so
I
say
what
I
really
feel
;
and
after
a
call
of
some
duration
 
all
the
time
of
which
I
have
<EOS>
no
doubt
Miss
Pole
think
Miss
Matty
receive
the
news
very
calmly
 
our
visitor
take
her
leave
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
make
a
strong
effort
to
conceal
her
feeling
 
a
concealment
she
practise
even
with
me
,
for
she
have
never
allude
to
Mr
Holbrook
again
,
although
the
book
he
give
her
lie
with
her
Bible
on
the
little
table
by
her
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
think
I
hear
her
when
she
ask
the
little
milliner
of
Cranford
to
make
her
cap
something
like
the
honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
's
,
or
that
I
notice
the
reply
     
<EOS>
"
but
she
wear
widow
'
cap
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
only
mean
something
in
that
style
;
not
widow
'
,
of
course
,
but
rather
like
Mrs
Jamieson
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
effort
at
concealment
be
the
beginning
of
the
tremulous
motion
of
head
and
hand
which
I
have
see
ever
since
in
Miss
Matty
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
we
hear
of
Mr
Holbrook
's
death
,
Miss
Matilda
be
very
silent
and
thoughtful
;
after
prayer
she
call
Martha
back
<EOS>
and
then
she
stand
uncertain
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Martha
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
at
last
,
"
you
be
young
"
 
a
nd
<EOS>
then
she
make
so
long
a
pause
that
Martha
,
to
remind
her
of
her
half
-
finished
sentence
,
drop
a
curtsey
,
and
say
     
"
<EOS>
yes
,
please
,
madam
;
two
-
and
-
twenty
last
third
of
October

<EOS>
"
  
"
and
,
perhaps
,
Martha
,
you
may
some
time
meet
with
a
young
man
you
like
,
and
who
like
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
say
you
be
not
to
have
follower
;
but
if
you
meet
with
such
a
young
man
,
and
tell
me
,
and
I
find
he
be
respectable
,
I
have
no
objection
to
his
come
to
see
you
once
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
God
forbid
!
"
say
she
in
a
low
voice
,
"
that
I
should
grieve
any
young
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
speak
as
if
she
be
provide
for
some
distant
contingency
,
and
be
rather
startled
when
Martha
make
her
ready
eager
answer
     
<EOS>
"

she
submit
to

old
letter
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
notice
that
almost
every
one
have
his
own
individual
small
economy
 
careful
habit
of
save
fraction
of
penny
in
some
one
peculiar
direction
 
any
disturbance
of
which
annoy
him
more
than
spend
shilling

pound
on
some
real
extravagance

<EOS>
an
old

of
my
acquaintance

who
take
the
intelligence
of
the
failure
of
a
Joint

Stock
Bank
,
in
which
some
of
his
money
be
invest
,
with
stoical
mildness
,
worry
his
family
all
through
a
long
summer
's
day
because
one
of
them
have
tear
(
instead
of
cut
)
out
the
write
leave
of
his
now
useless
bank
-
book
;
of
course
,
the
corresponding
page
at
the
other
end
come
out
as
well
,
and
this
little
unnecessary
waste
of
paper
(
his
private
economy
)
chafe
him
more
than
all
the
loss
of
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
Envelopes
fret
his
soul
terribly
when
they
first
come
in
;
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
reconcile
himself
to
such
waste
of
his
cherish
article
be
by
patiently
turn
inside
out
all
that
be
send
to
him
,
and
so
make
them
serve
again
.
 
<EOS>
even
now
,
though
tame
by
age
,
I
see
him
cast
wistful
glance
at
his
daughter
when
they
send
a
whole
inside
of
a
half
-
sheet
of
note
paper
,
with
the
three
line
of
acceptance
to
an
invitation

write
on
only
one

the
side

<EOS>
I
be
not

I
have
this
human

myself

<EOS>
My

get
full

little
hank

it

pick
up
and
twist
together
,
ready
for
use
that
never
come

<EOS>
I
be
seriously
annoy
if
any
one
cut
the
string
of
a
parcel
instead
of
patiently
and
faithfully
undo
it
fold
by
fold
.
 
<EOS>
how
people
can
bring
themselves
to
use
india

rubber
ring
,
which
be
a
sort
of
deification
of
string
,
as
lightly
as
they
do

I
can
not
imagine

<EOS>
to
me
an
india

be
a
precious

<EOS>
I
have
one
which
be
not

one
that
I
pick
up
off
the
floor
nearly
six
year
ago

I

really
try

it

but
my
heart
fail
me
,
and
I
could
not
commit
the
extravagance
.
  
<EOS>
small
piece
of
butter
grieve
other
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
not
attend
to
conversation
because
of
the
annoyance
occasion
by
the
habit
which
some
people
have
of
invariably
take
more
butter
than
they
want
.
<EOS>
have
you
not
see
the
anxious
look
(
almost
mesmeric
)
which
such
person
fix
on
the
article
?
 
<EOS>
They
would
feel
it
a
relief
if
they
may
bury
it
out
of
their
sight
by
pop
it
into
their
own
mouth
and
swallow
it
down
;
and
they
be
really
make
happy
<EOS>
if
the
person
on
whose
plate
it
lie
unused
suddenly
break
off
a
piece
of
toast
(
which
he
do
not
want
at
all
)
and
eat
up
his
butter
.
 
<EOS>
They
think
that
this
be
not
waste
.
  
<EOS>
now
Miss
Matty
Jenkyns
be
chary
of
candle
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
many
device
to
use
as
few
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
winter
afternoon
she
would
sit
knit
for
two
or
three
hour
 
<EOS>
she
could
do
this
in
the
dark
,
or
by
firelight
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
ask
if
I
may
not
ring
for
candle
to
finish
stitch
my
wristband
,
she
tell
me
to
"
keep
blind
man
's
holiday
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
be
usually
bring
in
with
tea
;
but
we
only
burn
one
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
live
in
constant
preparation
for
a
friend
who
may
come
in
any
evening
(
but
who
never
do
)
,
it
require
some
contrivance
to
keep
our
two
candle
of
the
same
length
,
ready
to
be
light
,
and
to
look
as
if
we
burn
two
always
.
 
<EOS>
the
candle
take
it
in
turn
;
and
,
whatever
we
may
be
talk
about
or
do
,
Miss
Matty
's
eye
be
habitually
fix
upon
the
candle
,
ready
to
jump
up
and
extinguish
it
and
to
light
the
other
before
they
have
become
too
uneven
in
length
to
be
restore
to
equality
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
one
night
,
I
remember
this
candle
economy
particularly
annoy
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
very
much
tired
of
my
compulsory
"
blind
man
's
holiday
,
"
especially
as
Miss
Matty
have
fall
asleep
,
and
I
do
not
like
to
stir
the
fire
and
run
the
risk
of
awaken
her
;
so
I
could
not
even
sit
on
the
rug
,
and
scorch
myself
with
sewing
by
firelight
,
accord
to
my
usual
custom
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
Miss
Matty
must
be
dream
of
her
early
life
;
for
she
speak
one
or
two
word
in
her
uneasy
sleep
bear
reference
to
person
who
be
dead
long
before
.
 
<EOS>
when
Martha
bring
in
the
lighted
candle
and
tea
,
Miss
Matty
start
into
wakefulness
,
with
a
strange
,
bewilder
look
around
,
as
if
we
be
not
the
people
she
expect
to
see
about
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
sad
expression
that
shadow
her
face
as
she
recognise
me
;
but
immediately
afterwards
she
try
to
give
me
her
usual
smile
.
 
<EOS>
all
through
tea
-
time
her
talk
run
upon
the
day
of
her
childhood
and
youth
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
this
remind
her
of
the
desirableness
of
look
over
all
the
old
family
letter
,
and
destroy
such
as
ought
not
to
be
allow
to
fall
into
the
hand
of
stranger
;
for
she
have
often
speak
of
the
necessity
of
this
task
,
but
have
always
shrink
from
it
,
with
a
timid
dread
of
something
painful
.
 
<EOS>
to
-
night
,
however
,
she
rise
up
after
tea
and
go
for
them
 
in
the
dark
;
for
she
pique
herself
on
the
precise
neatness
of
all
her
chamber
arrangement
,
and
use
to
look
uneasily
at
me
when
I
light
a
bed
-
candle
to
go
to
another
room
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
return
there
be
a
faint
,
pleasant
smell
of
Tonquin
bean
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
notice
this
scent
about
any
of
the
thing
which
have
belong
to
her
mother
;
and
many
of
the
letter
be
address
to
her
 
yellow
bundle
of
love
-
letter
,
sixty
or
seventy
year
old
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
undo
the
packet
with
a
sigh
;
but
she
stifle
it
directly
,
as
if
it
be
hardly
right
to
regret
the
flight
of
time
,
or
of
life
either
.
 
<EOS>
We
agree
to
look
them
over
separately
,
each
take
a
different
letter
out
of
the
same
bundle
and
describe
its
content
to
the
other
before
destroy
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
know
what
sad
work
the
reading
of
old
-
letter
be
before
that
evening
,
though
I
could
hardly
tell
why
.
 
<EOS>
the
letter
be
as
happy
as
letter
could
be
 
<EOS>
at
least
those
early
letter
be
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
in
them
a
vivid
and
intense
sense
of
the
present
time
,
which
seem
so
strong
and
full
,
as
if
it
could
never
pass
away
,
and
as
if
the
warm
,
live
heart
that
so
express
themselves
could
never
die
,
and
be
as
nothing
to
the
sunny
earth
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
feel
less
melancholy
,
I
believe
,
if
the
letter
have
be
more
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
tear
steal
down
the
well
-
wear
furrow
of
Miss
Matty
's
cheek
,
and
her
spectacle
often
want
wipe
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
at
last
that
she
would
light
the
other
candle
,
for
my
own
eye
be
rather
dim
,
and
I
want
more
light
to
see
the
pale
,
fade
ink
;
<EOS>
but
no
,
even
through
her
tear
,
she
see
and
remember
her
little
economical
way
.
  
<EOS>
the
early
set
of
letter
be
two
bundle
tie
together
,
and
ticket
(
in
Miss
Jenkyns
's
handwriting
)
<EOS>
"
letter
interchange
between
my
ever
-
honoured
father
and
my
dearly
-
beloved
mother
,
prior
to
their
marriage
,
in
July
1774
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
should
guess
that
the
rector
of
Cranford
be
about
twenty
-
seven
year
of
age
when
he
write
those
letter
;
and
Miss
Matty
tell
me
that
her
mother
be
just
eighteen
at
the
time
of
her
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
with
my
idea
of
the
rector
derive
from
a
picture
in
the
dining
-
parlour
,
stiff
and
stately
,
in
a
huge
full
-
bottom
wig
,
with
gown
,
cassock
,
and
band
,
and
his
hand
upon
a
copy
of
the
only
sermon
he
ever
publish
 
it
be
strange
to
read
these
letter
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
full
of
eager
,
passionate
ardour
;
short
homely
sentence
,
right
fresh
from
the
heart
(
very
different
from
the
grand
latinised
,
johnsonian
style
of
the
print
sermon
preach
before
some
judge
at
assize
time
)
.
 
<EOS>
His
letter
be
a
curious
contrast
to
those
of
his
girl
-
bride
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
evidently
rather
annoyed
at
his
demand
upon
her
for
expression
of
love
,
and
could
not
quite
understand
what
he
mean
by
repeat
the
same
thing
over
in
so
many
different
way
;
but
what
she
be
quite
clear
about
be
a
longing
for
a
white
"
Paduasoy
"
 
w
hatever
that
may
be
;
and
six
or
seven
letter
be
principally
occupy
in
ask
her
lover
to
use
his
influence
with
her
parent
(
who
evidently
keep
her
in
good
order
)
to
obtain
this
or
that
article
of
dress
,
more
especially
the
white
"
Paduasoy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
care
nothing
how
she
be
dress
;
she
be
always
lovely
enough
for
him
,
as
he
take
pain
to
assure
her
,
when
she
beg
him
to
express
in
his
answer
a
predilection
for
particular
piece
of
finery
,
in
order
that
she
may
show
what
he
say
to
her
parent
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
length
he
seem
to
find
out
that
she
would
not
be
marry
till
she
have
a
"
trousseau
"
to
her
mind
;
and
then
he
send
her
a
letter
,
which
have
evidently
accompany
a
whole
box
full
of
finery
,
and
in
which
he
request
that
she
may
be
dress
in
everything
her
heart
desire
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
letter
,
ticket
in
a
frail
,
delicate
hand
,
"
from
my
dear
John
.
"
 
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
they
be
married
,
I
suppose
,
from
the
intermission
in
their
correspondence
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
burn
them
,
I
think
,
"
say
Miss
Matty
,
look
doubtfully
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
one
will
care
for
them
when
I
be
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
one
by
one
she
drop
them
into
the
middle
of
the
fire
,
watch
each
blaze
up
,
die
out
,
and
rise
away
,
in
faint
,
white
,
ghostly
semblance
,
up
the
chimney
,
before
she
give
another
to
the
same
fate
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
be
light
enough
now
;
but
I
,
like
her
,
be
fascinate
into
watch
the
destruction
of
those
letter
,
into
which
the
honest
warmth
of
a
manly
heart
have
be
pour
forth
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
letter
,
likewise
docket
by
Miss
Jenkyns
,
be
endorse
,
"
Letter
of
pious
congratulation
and
exhortation
from
my
venerable
grandfather
to
my
beloved
mother
,
on
occasion
of
my
own
birth
.
<EOS>
also
some
practical
remark
on
the
desirability
of
keep
warm
the
extremity
of
infant
,
from
my
excellent
grandmother
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
first
part
be
,
indeed
,
a
severe
and
forcible
picture
of
the
responsibility
of
mother
,
and
a
warning
against
the
evil
that
be
in
the
world
,
and
lie
in
<EOS>
ghastly
wait
for
the
little
baby
of
two
day
old
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
do
not
write
,
say
the
old
gentleman
,
because
he
have
forbid
it
,
she
be
indispose
with
a
sprain
ankle
,
which
(
he
say
)
quite
incapacitate
her
from
hold
a
pen
.
<EOS>
however
,
at
the
foot
of
the
page
be
a
small
"
T.O.
,
"
and
on
turn
it
over
,
sure
enough
,
there
be
a
letter
to
"
my
dear
,
dear
Molly
,
"
beg
her
,
when
she
leave
her
room
,
whatever
she
do
,
to
go
up
stair
before
go
down
:
 
and
tell
her
to
wrap
her
baby
's
foot
up
in
flannel
,
and
keep
it
warm
by
the
fire
,
although
it
be
summer
,
for
baby
be
so
tender
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
to
see
from
the
letter
,
which
be
evidently
exchange
with
some
frequency
between
the
young
mother
and
the
grandmother
,
how
the
girlish
vanity
be
be
weed
out
of
her
heart
by
love
for
her
baby
.
 
<EOS>
the
white
"
Paduasoy
"
figure
again
in
the
letter
,
with
almost
as
much
vigour
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
,
it
be
be
make
into
a
christen
cloak
for
the
baby
.
 
<EOS>
It
deck
it
when
it
go
with
its
parent
to
spend
a
day
or
two
at
Arley
Hall
.
<EOS>
It
add
to
its
charm
,
when
it
be
"
the
pretty
little
baby
that
ever
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
dear
mother
,
I
wish
you
could
see
her
!
 
<EOS>
without
any
pershality
,
I
do
think
she
will
grow
up
a
regular
bewty
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
Miss
Jenkyns
,
grey
,
wither
,
and
wrinkle
,
and
I
wonder
if
her
mother
have
know
her
in
the
court
of
heaven
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
know
that
she
have
,
and
that
they
stand
there
in
angelic
guise
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
gap
before
any
of
the
rector
's
letter
appear
.
<EOS>
and
then
his
wife
have
change
her
mode
of
her
endorsement
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
longer
from
,
"
My
dearest
John
;
"
it
be
from
"
My
Honoured
Husband
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
letter
be
write
on
occasion
of
the
publication
of
the
same
sermon
which
be
represent
in
the
picture
.
 
<EOS>
the
preaching
before
"
My
Lord
Judge
,
"
and
the
"
publishing
by
request
,
"
be
evidently
the
culminating
point
 
<EOS>
the
event
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
necessary
for
him
to
go
up
to
London
to
superintend
it
through
the
press
.
 
<EOS>
many
friend
have
to
be
call
upon
and
consult
before
he
could
decide
on
any
printer
fit
for
so
onerous
a
task
;
and
at
length
it
be
arrange
that
J.
and
J.
Rivingtons
be
to
have
the
honourable
responsibility
.
 
<EOS>
the
worthy
rector
seem
to
be
string
up
by
the
occasion
to
a
high
literary
pitch
,
for
he
could
hardly
write
a
letter
to
his
wife
without
crop
out
into
Latin
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
end
of
one
of
his
letter
run
thus
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
ever
hold
the
virtuous
quality
of
my
Molly
in
remembrance
,
dum
memor
ipse
mei
,
dum
spiritus
regit
artus
,
"
which
,
consider
that
the
English
of
his
correspondent
be
sometimes
at
fault
in
grammar
,
and
often
in
spelling
,
may
be
take
as
a
proof
of
how
much
he
"
idealise
his
Molly
;
"
and
,
as
Miss
Jenkyns
use
to
say
,
"
People
talk
a
great
deal
about
idealise
now
-
a
-
day
,
whatever
that
may
mean
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
nothing
to
a
fit
of
write
classical
poetry
which
soon
seize
him
,
in
which
his
Molly
figure
away
as
"
Maria
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
letter
contain
the
carman
be
endorse
by
her
,
"
Hebrew
verse
send
me
by
my
honoured
husband
.
 
<EOS>
I
thowt
to
have
have
a
letter
about
kill
the
pig
,
but
must
wait
.
 
<EOS>
Mem
.
,
to
send
the
poetry
to
Sir
Peter
Arley
,
as
my
husband
desire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
in
a
post
-
scriptum
note
in
his
handwriting
it
be
state
that
the
Ode
have
appear
in
the
Gentleman
's
Magazine
,
December
1782
.
  
<EOS>
Her
letter
back
to
her
husband
(
treasure
as
fondly
by
him
as
if
they
have
be
M.
T.
Ciceronis
Epistolae
)
be
more
satisfactory
to
an
absent
husband
and
father
than
his
<EOS>
could
ever
have
be
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
tell
him
how
Deborah
sew
her
seam
very
neatly
every
day
,
and
read
to
her
in
the
book
he
have
set
her
;
how
she
be
a
very
"
forrard
,
"
good
child
,
but
would
ask
question
her
mother
could
not
answer
,
but
how
she
do
not
let
herself
down
by
say
she
do
not
know
,
but
take
to
stir
the
fire
,
or
send
the
"
forrard
"
child
on
an
errand
.
 
<EOS>
Matty
be
now
the
mother
's
darling
,
and
promise
(
like
her
sister
at
her
age
)
,
to
be
a
great
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
read
this
aloud
to
Miss
Matty
,
who
smile
and
sigh
a
little
at
the
hope
,
so
fondly
express
,
that
"
little
Matty
may
not
be
vain
,
even
if
she
be
a
bewty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
very
pretty
hair
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mist
Matilda
;
"
and
not
a
bad
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
I
see
her
soon
afterwards
adjust
her
cap
and
draw
herself
up
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
Mrs
Jenkyns
's
letter
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
her
husband
about
the
poor
in
the
parish
;
what
homely
domestic
medicine
she
have
administer
;
what
kitchen
physic
she
have
send
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
evidently
hold
his
displeasure
as
a
rod
in
pickle
over
the
head
of
all
the
ne'er
-
do
-
well
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
for
his
direction
about
the
cow
and
pig
;
and
do
not
always
obtain
them
,
as
I
have
show
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
kind
old
grandmother
be
dead
when
a
little
boy
be
bear
,
soon
after
the
publication
of
the
sermon
;
but
there
be
another
letter
of
exhortation
from
the
grandfather
,
more
stringent
and
admonitory
than
ever
,
now
that
there
be
a
boy
to
be
guard
from
the
snare
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
describe
all
the
various
sin
into
which
man
may
fall
,
until
I
wonder
how
any
man
ever
come
to
a
natural
death
.
 
<EOS>
the
gallow
seem
as
if
it
must
have
be
the
termination
of
the
life
of
most
of
the
grandfather
's
friend
and
acquaintance
;
and
I
be
not
surprised
at
the
way
in
which
he
speak
of
this
life
be
"
a
vale
of
tear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seem
curious
that
I
should
never
have
hear
of
this
brother
before
;
but
I
conclude
that
he
have
die
young
,
or
else
surely
his
name
would
have
be
allude
to
by
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
we
come
to
packet
of
Miss
Jenkyns
's
letter
.
 
<EOS>
these
Miss
Matty
do
regret
to
burn
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
all
the
other
have
be
only
interesting
to
those
who
love
the
writer
,
and
that
it
seem
as
if
it
would
have
hurt
her
to
allow
them
to
fall
into
the
hand
of
stranger
,
who
have
not
know
her
dear
mother
,
and
how
good
she
be
,
although
she
do
not
always
spell
,
quite
in
the
modern
fashion
;
but
Deborah
's
letter
be
so
very
superior
!
 
<EOS>
any
one
may
profit
by
read
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
time
since
she
have
read
Mrs
Chapone
,
but
she
know
she
use
to
think
that
Deborah
could
have
say
the
same
thing
quite
as
well
;
and
as
for
Mrs
Carter
!
<EOS>
people
think
a
deal
of
her
letter
,
just
because
she
have
write
"
Epictetus
,
"
but
she
be
quite
sure
Deborah
would
never
have
make
use
of
such
a
common
expression
as
"
I
canna
be
fashe
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
do
grudge
burn
these
letter
,
it
be
evident
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
let
them
be
carelessly
pass
over
with
any
quiet
reading
,
and
skipping
,
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
them
from
me
,
and
even
light
the
second
candle
in
order
to
read
them
aloud
with
a
proper
emphasis
,
and
without
stumble
over
the
big
word
.
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
how
I
want
fact
instead
of
reflection
,
before
those
letter
be
conclude
!
 
<EOS>
They
last
us
two
night
;
and
I
will
not
deny
that
I
make
use
of
the
time
to
think
of
many
other
thing
,
and
yet
I
be
always
at
my
post
at
the
end
of
each
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
the
rector
's
letter
,
and
those
of
his
wife
and
mother
-
in
-
law
,
have
all
be
tolerably
short
and
pithy
,
write
in
a
straight
hand
,
with
the
line
very
close
together
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
the
whole
letter
be
contain
on
a
mere
scrap
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
the
paper
be
very
yellow
,
and
the
ink
very
brown
;
some
of
the
sheet
be
(
as
Miss
Matty
make
me
observe
)
<EOS>
the
old
original
post
,
with
the
stamp
in
the
corner
represent
a
post
-
boy
riding
for
life
and
twang
his
horn
.
 
<EOS>
the
letter
of
Mrs
Jenkyns
and
her
mother
be
fasten
with
a
great
round
red
wafer
;
for
it
be
before
Miss
Edgeworth
's
"
patronage
"
have
banish
wafer
from
polite
society
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
evident
,
from
the
tenor
of
what
be
say
,
that
frank
be
in
great
request
,
and
be
even
use
as
a
means
of
pay
debt
by
needy
member
of
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
the
rector
seal
his
epistle
with
an
immense
coat
of
arm
,
and
show
by
the
care
with
which
he
have
perform
this
ceremony
that
he
expect
they
should
be
cut
open
,
not
break
by
any
thoughtless
or
impatient
hand
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Miss
Jenkyns
's
letter
be
of
a
later
date
in
form
and
writing
.
 
<EOS>
She
write
on
the
square
sheet
which
we
have
learn
to
call
old
-
fashioned
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hand
be
admirably
calculate
,
together
with
her
use
of
many
-
syllable
word
,
to
fill
up
a
sheet
,
and
then
come
the
pride
and
delight
of
cross
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Matty
get
sadly
puzzle
with
this
,
for
the
word
gather
size
like
snowball
,
and
towards
the
end
of
her
letter
Miss
Jenkyns
use
to
become
quite
sesquipedalian
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
to
her
father
,
slightly
theological
and
controversial
in
its
tone
,
she
have
speak
of
Herod
,
Tetrarch
of
Idumea
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
read
it
"
Herod
Petrarch
of
Etruria
,
"
and
be
just
as
well
pleased
as
if
she
have
be
right
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
quite
remember
the
date
,
but
I
think
it
be
in
1805
that
Miss
Jenkyns
write
the
long
series
of
letter
 
on
occasion
of
her
absence
on
a
visit
to
some
friend
near
Newcastle
-
upon
-
tyne
.
<EOS>
these
friend
be
intimate
with
the
commandant
of
the
garrison
there
,
and
hear
from
him
of
all
the
preparation
that
be
be
make
to
repel
the
invasion
of
Buonaparte
,
which
some
people
imagine
may
take
place
at
the
mouth
of
the
Tyne
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
be
evidently
very
much
alarm
;
and
the
first
part
of
her
letter
be
often
write
in
pretty
intelligible
English
,
convey
particular
of
the
preparation
which
be
make
in
the
family
with
whom
she
be
reside
against
the
dreaded
event
;
the
bundle
of
clothe

up
ready
for
a
flight
to
Alston
Moor
(
a
wild
hilly
piece
of
ground
between
Northumberland
and
Cumberland
)
;
the
signal
that
be
to
be
give
for
this
flight

and
for
the
simultaneous
turning
out
of
the
volunteer

say
signal
be
to
consist
(
if
I
remember
rightly
)
in
ring
the
church
bell
in
a
particular
and
ominous
manner

<EOS>
one
day
,
when
Miss
Jenkyns
and
her
host
be
at
a
dinner
-
party
in
Newcastle
,
this
warning
summon
be
actually
give
(
not
a
very
wise
proceeding
,
if
there
be
any
truth
in
the
moral
attach
to
the
fable
of
the
Boy
and
the
Wolf
;
but
so
it
be
)
,
and
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
,
hardly
recover
from
her
fright
,
write
the
next
day
to
describe
the
sound
,
the
breathless
shock
,
the
hurry
and
alarm
;
and
then
,
take
breath
,
she
add
,
"
how
trivial
,
my
dear
father
,
do
all
our
apprehension
of
the
last
evening
appear
,
at
the
present
moment
,
to
calm
and
enquire
mind
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
here
Miss
Matty
break
in
with
     
<EOS>
"
but
,
indeed
,
my
dear
,
they
be
not
at
all
trivial
or
trifling
at
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
use
to
wake
up
in
the
night
many
a
time
and
think
I
hear
the
tramp
of
the
french
enter
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
many
people
talk
of
hide
themselves
in
the
salt
mine
 
and
meat
would
have
keep
capitally
down
there
,
only
perhaps
we
should
have
be
thirsty
.
 
<EOS>
and
my
father
preach
a
whole
set
of
sermon
on
the
occasion
;
one
set
in
the
morning
,
all
about
David
and
Goliath
,
to
spirit
up
the
people
to
fight
with
spade
or
brick
,
if
need
be
;
and
the
other
set
in
the
afternoon
,
prove
that
Napoleon
(
that
be
another
name
for
Bony
,
as
we
use
to
call
him
)
be
all
the
same
as
an
Apollyon
and
Abaddon
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
my
father
rather
think
he
should
be
ask
to
print
this
last
set
;
but
the
parish
have
,
perhaps
,
have
enough
of
them
with
hearing

"
  
<EOS>
Peter
Marmaduke
Arley
Jenkyns
(
"
poor
Peter
!
"
<EOS>
as
Miss
Matty
begin
to
call
him
)
be
at
school
at
Shrewsbury
by
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
rector
take
up
his
pen
,
and
rub
up
his
Latin
once
more
,
to
correspond
with
his
boy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
clear
that
the
lad
's
be
what
be
call
show
letter
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
of
a
highly
mental
description
,
give
an
account
of
his
study
,
and
his
intellectual
hope
of
various
kind
,
with
an
occasional
quotation
from
the
classic
;
but
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
the
animal
nature
break
out
in
such
a
little
sentence
as
this
,
evidently
write
in
a
tremble
hurry
,
after
the
letter
have
be
inspect
:
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
dear
,
do
send
me
a
cake
,
and
put
plenty
of
citron
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
"
mother
dear
"
probably
answer
her
boy
in
the
form
of
cake
and
"
goody
,
"
for
there
be
none
of
her
letter
among
this
set
;
but
a
whole
collection
of
the
rector
's
,
to
whom
the
Latin
in
his
boy
's
letter
be
like
a
trumpet
to
the
old
war
-
horse
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
much
about
Latin
,
certainly
,
and
it
be
,
perhaps
,
an
ornamental
language
,
but
not
very
useful
,
I
think
 
at
least
to
judge
from
the
bit
I
remember
out
of
the
rector
's
letter
.
 
<EOS>
one
be
,
"
You
have
not
get
that
town

your
map
of
Ireland

but
Bonus
Bernardus
non
videt

as
the
Proverbia
say
.
"
 
<EOS>
presently
it
become
very
evident
that
"
poor
Peter
"
get
himself
into
many
scrape
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
letter
of
stilted
penitence
to
his
father
,
for
some
wrong
-
doing
;
and
among
them
all
be
a
badly
-
write
,
badly
-
seal
,
badly
-
direct
,
blot
note
:
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
dear

dear
,
dear
mother
,
I
will
be
a
well
boy
;
I
will

indeed
;
but
do
not

please
,
be
ill

I
be
not
worth
it

I
will
be
good

"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
could
not
speak
for
crying
,
after
she
have
read
this
note
.
 
<EOS>
She
give
it
to
me
in
silence
,
and
then
get
up
and
take
it
to
her
sacred
recess
in
her
own
room
,
for
fear
,
by
any
chance
,
it
may
get
burn
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Peter

"
<EOS>
she
say
;
"
he
be
always
in
scrape

he
be
too
easy

<EOS>
They
lead
him
wrong
,
and
then
leave
him
in
the
lurch
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
too
fond
of
mischief

<EOS>
He
could
never
resist
a
joke

<EOS>
Poor
Peter

<EOS>
POOR
PETER
 
<EOS>
Poor
Peter
's
career
lie
before
him
rather
pleasantly
map
out
by
kind
friend
,
but
Bonus
Bernardus
non
videt
omnia
,
in
this
map
too
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
win
honour
at
the
Shrewsbury
School
,
and
carry
them
thick
to
Cambridge
,
and
after
that
,
a
living
await
him
,
the
gift
of
his
godfather
,
Sir
Peter
Arley
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Peter
!
<EOS>
his
lot
in
life
be
very
different
to
what
his
friend
have
hope
and
plan
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
tell
me
all
about
it
,
and
I
think
it
be
a
relief
when
she
have
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
the
darling
of
his
mother
,
who
seem
to
dote
on
all
her
child
,
though
she
be
,
perhaps
,
a
little
afraid
of
Deborah
's
superior
acquirement
.
 
<EOS>
Deborah
be
the
favourite
of
her
father
,
and
when
Peter
disappoint
him
,
she
become
his
pride
.
 
<EOS>
the
sole
honour
Peter
bring
away
from
Shrewsbury
be
the
reputation
of
be
the
good
good
fellow
that
ever
be
,
and
of
be
the
captain
of
the
school
in
the
art
of
practical
joking
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
be
disappoint
,
but
set
about
remedy
the
matter
in
a
manly
way
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
afford
to
send
Peter
to
read
with
any
tutor
,
but
he
could
read
with
him
himself
;
and
Miss
Matty
tell
me
much
of
the
awful
preparation
in
the
way
of
dictionary
and
lexicon
that
be
make
in
her
father
's
study
the
morning
Peter
begin
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
poor
mother
!
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
remember
how
she
use
to
stand
in
the
hall
,
just
near
enough
the
study
-
door
,
to
catch
the
tone
of
my
father
's
voice
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
tell
in
a
moment
if
all
be
go
right
,
by
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
do
go
right
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
go
wrong
at
last
?
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
that
tiresome
Latin
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
<EOS>
it
be
not
the
Latin
.
 
<EOS>
Peter
be
in
high
favour
with
my
father
,
for
he
work
up
well
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
seem
to
think
that
the
Cranford
people
may
be
joke
about
,
and
make
fun
of
,
and
they
do
not
like
it
;
nobody
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
hoax
them
;
"
hoaxing
"
be
not
a
pretty
word
,
my
dear
,
and
I
hope
you
will
not
tell
your
father
<EOS>
I
use
it
,
<EOS>
for
I
should
not
like
him
to
think
that
I
be
not
choice
in
my
language
,
after
live
with
such
a
woman
as
Deborah
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
sure
you
never
use
it
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
slip
out
of
my
mouth
,
except
it
be
that
I
be
think
of
poor
Peter
<EOS>
and
it
be
always
his
expression
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
very
gentlemanly
boy
in
many
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
like
dear
Captain
Brown
in
always
be
ready
to
help
any
old
person
or
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
he
do
like
joke
and
make
fun
;
and
he
seem
to
think
the
old
lady
in
Cranford
would
believe
anything
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
old
lady
live
here
then
;
we
be
principally
lady
now
,
I
know
,
but
we
be
not
so
old
as
the
lady
use
to
be
when
I
be
a
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
laugh
to
think
of
some
of
Peter
's
joke
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
,
I
will
not
tell
you
of
them
,
because
they
may
not
shock
you
as
they
ought
to
do
,
and
they
be
very
shocking
.
 
<EOS>
He
even
take
in
my
father
once
,
by
dress
himself
up
as
a
lady
that
be
pass
through
the
town
and
wish
to
see
the
Rector
of
Cranford
,
"
who
have
publish
that
admirable
Assize
Sermon
.
"
 
<EOS>
Peter
say
he
be
awfully
frighten
himself
when
he
see
how
my
father
take
it
all
in
,
and
even
offer
to
copy
out
all
his
Napoleon
Buonaparte
sermon
for
her
 
him
,
I
mean
 
<EOS>
no
,
her
,
for
Peter
be
a
lady
then
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
be
more
terrified
than
he
ever
be
before
,
all
the
time
my
father
be
speak
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
think
my
father
would
have
believe
him
;
and
yet
if
he
have
not
,
it
would
have
be
a
sad
thing
for
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
he
be
none
so
glad
of
it
,
for
my
father
keep
him
hard
at
work
copy
out
all
those
twelve
Buonaparte
sermon
for
the
lady
 
that
be
for
Peter
himself
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
and
once
when
he
want
to
go
fishing
,
Peter
say
,
"
confound
the
woman
!
"
 
<EOS>
very
bad
language
,
my
dear
,
but
<EOS>
Peter
be
not
always
so
guard
as
he
should
have
be
;
my
father
be
so
angry
with
him
,
it
nearly
frighten
me
out
of
my
wit
:
 
and
yet
I
could
hardly
keep
from
laugh
at
the
little
curtsey
Peter
keep
make
,
quite
slyly
,
whenever
my
father
speak
of
the
lady
's
excellent
taste
and
sound
discrimination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Miss
Jenkyns
know
of
these
trick
?
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Deborah
would
have
be
too
much
shocked
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
one
know
but
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
always
know
of
Peter
's
plan
;
but
sometimes
he
do
not
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
use
to
say
the
old
lady
in
the
town
want
something
to
talk
about
;
but
I
do
not
think
they
do
.
<EOS>
They
have
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
three
time
a
week
,
just
as
we
have
now
,
and
we
have
plenty
to
say
;
and
I
remember
the
clack
noise
there
always
be
when
some
of
the
lady
get
together
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
probably
,
schoolboy
talk
more
than
lady
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
there
be
a
terrible
,
sad
thing
happen
.
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
get
up
,
go
to
the
door
,
and
open
it
;
no
one
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
ring
the
bell
for
Martha
,
and
when
Martha
come
,
her
mistress
tell
her
to
go
for
egg
to
a
farm
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
lock
the
door
after
you
,
Martha

<EOS>
You
be
not
afraid
to
go
,
be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
madam
,
not
at
all
;
Jem
Hearn
will
be
only
too
proud
to
go
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
draw
herself
up
,
and
as
soon
as
we
be
alone
,
she
wish
that
Martha
have
more
maidenly
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
put
out
the
candle
,
my
dear
.

We
can
talk
just
as
well
by
firelight

you
know

<EOS>
there
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
you
see
,
Deborah
have
go
from
home
for
a
fortnight
or
so
;
it
be
a
very
still
,
quiet
day
,
I
remember
,
overhead
;
and
the
lilacs
be
all
in
flower
,
so
I
suppose
it
be
spre
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
have
go
out
to
see
some
sick
people
in
the
parish
;
I
recollect
see
him
leave
the
house
with
his
wig
and
shovel
-
hat
and
cane
.
 
<EOS>
what
possess
our
poor
Peter
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
;
he
have
the
sweet
temper
,
and
yet
he
always
seem
to
like
to
plague
Deborah
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
laugh
at
his
joke
,
and
think
him
ungenteel
,
and
not
careful
enough
about
improve
his
mind
;
and
that
vex
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
he
go
to
her
room
,
it
seem
,
and
dress
himself
in
her
old
gown
,
and
shawl
,
and
bonnet
;
just
the
thing
she
use
to
wear
in
Cranford
,
and
be
know
by
everywhere
;
and
he
make
the
pillow
into
a
little
 
you
be
sure
you
lock
the
door
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
for
I
should
not
like
anyone
to
hear
 
into
 
into
a
little
baby
,
with
white
long
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
,
as
he
tell
me
afterwards
,
to
make
something
to
talk
about
in
the
town
;
he
never
think
of
it
as
affect
Deborah
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
go
and
walk
up
and
down
in
the
Filbert
walk
 
just
half
-
hide
by
the
rail
,
and
half
-
see
;
and
he
cuddle
his
pillow
,
just
like
a
baby
,
and
talk
to
it
all
the
nonsense
people
do
.
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
and
my
father
come
step
stately
up
the
street
,
as
he
always
do
;
and
what
should
he
see
but
a
little
black
crowd
of
people
 
<EOS>
I
daresay
as
many
as
twenty
 
all
peep
through
his
garden
rail
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
think
,
at
first
,
they
be
only
look
at
a
new
rhododendron
that
be
in
full
bloom
,
and
that
he
be
very
proud
of
;
and
he
walk
slower
,
that
they
may
have
more
time
to
admire
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
wonder
if
he
could
make
out
a
sermon
from
the
occasion
,
and
think
,
perhaps
,
there
be
some
relation
between
the
rhododendron
and
the
lily
of
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
father
!
 
<EOS>
when
he
come
nearer
,
he
begin
to
wonder
that
they
do
not
see
him
;
but
their
head
be
all
so
close
together
,
peep
and
peeping
!
 
<EOS>
My
father
be
amongst
them
,
meaning
,
he
say
,
to
ask
them
to
walk
into
the
garden
with
him
,
and
admire
the
beautiful
vegetable
production
,
<EOS>
when
 
oh
,
my
dear
,
I
tremble
to
think
of
it
 
<EOS>
he
look
through
the
rail
himself
,
and
see
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
he
think
he
see
,
but
old
Clare
tell
me
his
face
go
quite
grey
-
white
with
anger
,
and
his
eye
blaze
out
under
his
frown
black
brow
;
and
he
speak
out
 
oh
,
so
terribly
!
 
and
bade
them
all
stop
where
they
be
 
not
one
of
them
to
go
,
not
one
of
them
to
stir
a
step
;
and
,
swift
as
light
,
he
be
in
at
the
garden
door
,
and
down
the
Filbert
walk
,
and
seize
hold
of
poor
Peter
,
and
tear
his
clothe
off
his
back
 
bonnet
,
shawl
,
gown
,
and
all
 
and
throw
the
pillow
among
the
people
over
the
railing
:
 
and
then
he
be
very
,
very
angry
indeed
,
and
before
all
the
people
he
lift
up
his
cane
and
flog
Peter
!
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
that
boy
's
trick
,
on
that
sunny
day
,
when
all
seem
go
straight
and
well
,
break
my
mother
's
heart
,
and
change
my
father
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Clare
say
,
Peter
look
as
white
as
my
father
;
and
stand
as
still
as
a
statue
to
be
flog
;
and
my
father
strike
hard
!
 
<EOS>
when
my
father
stop
to
take
breath
,
Peter
say
,
"
have
you
do
enough
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
quite
hoarsely
,
and
still
stand
quite
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
my
father
say
 
<EOS>
or
if
he
say
anything
.
 
<EOS>
but
old
Clare
say
,
Peter
turn
to
where
the
people
outside
the
rail
be
,
and
make
them
a
low
bow
,
as
grand
and
as
grave
as
any
gentleman
;
and
then
walk
slowly
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
store
-
room
help
my
mother
to
make
cowslip
wine
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
abide
the
wine
now
,
nor
the
scent
of
the
flower
;
they
turn
me
sick
and
faint
,
as
they
do
that
day
,
when
Peter
come
in
,
look
as
haughty
as
any
man
 
indeed
,
look
like
a
man
,
not
like
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
"
I
be
come
to
say
,
God
bless
you
for
ever
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
see
his
lip
quiver
as
he
speak
;
and
I
think
he
durst
not
say
anything
more
loving
,
for
the
purpose
that
be
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
rather
frighten
,
and
wonder
,
and
ask
him
what
be
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
smile
or
speak
,
but
put
his
arm
round
her
and
kiss
her
as
if
he
do
not
know
how
to
leave
off
;
and
before
she
could
speak
again
,
he
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
We
talk
it
over
,
and
could
not
understand
it
,
and
she
bid
me
go
and
seek
my
father
,
and
ask
what
it
be
all
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
him
walk
up
and
down
,
look
very
highly
displeased
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
tell
your
mother
I
have
flog
Peter
,
and
that
he
richly
deserve
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
durst
not
ask
any
more
question
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
tell
my
mother
,
she
sit
down
,
quite
faint
,
for
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
a
few
day
after
,
I
see
the
poor
,
withered
cowslip
flower
throw
out
to
the
leaf
heap
,
to
decay
and
die
there
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
making
of
cowslip
wine
that
year
at
the
rectory
 
nor
,
indeed
,
ever
after
.
  
<EOS>
"
presently
my
mother
go
to
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
think
of
Queen
Esther
and
King
Ahasuerus
;
for
my
mother
be
very
pretty
and
delicate
-
look
,
and
my
father
look
as
terrible
as
King
Ahasuerus
.
 
<EOS>
some
time
after
they
come
out
together
;
and
then
my
mother
tell
me
what
have
happen
,
and
that
she
be
go
up
to
Peter
's
room
at
my
father
's
desire
 
though
she
be
not
to
tell
Peter
this
 
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
Peter
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
We
look
over
the
house
;
no
Peter
be
there
!
 
<EOS>
even
my
father
,
who
have
not
like
to
join
in
the
search
at
first
,
help
us
before
long
.
 
<EOS>
the
rectory
be
a
very
old
house
 
step
up
into
a
room
,
step
down
into
a
room
,
all
through
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
my
mother
go
call
low
and
soft
,
as
if
to
reassure
the
poor
boy
,
"
Peter
!
<EOS>
Peter
,
dear
!
<EOS>
it
be
only
me
;
"
but
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
as
the
servant
come
back
from
the
errand
my
father
have
send
them
,
in
different
direction
,
to
find
where
Peter
be
 
as
we
find
he
be
not
in
the
garden
,
nor
the
hayloft
,
nor
anywhere
about
 
my
mother
's
cry
grow
louder
and
wild
,
Peter
!
 
<EOS>
Peter
,
my
darling
!
<EOS>
where
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
for
then
she
feel
and
understand
that
that
long
kiss
mean
some
sad
kind
of
"
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
afternoon
go
on
 
my
mother
never
rest
,
but
seek
again
and
again
in
every
possible
place
that
have
be
look
into
twenty
time
before
,
nay
,
that
she
have
look
into
over
and
over
again
herself
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
sit
with
his
head
in
his
hand
,
not
speak
except
when
his
messenger
come
in
,
bring
no
tiding
;
then
he
lift
up
his
face
,
so
strong
and
sad
,
and
tell
them
to
go
again
in
some
new
direction
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
keep
pass
from
room
to
room
,
in
and
out
of
the
house
,
move
noiselessly
,
but
never
cease
.
 
<EOS>
neither
she
nor
my
father
<EOS>
durst
leave
the
house
,
which
be
the
meeting
-
place
for
all
the
messenger
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
(
and
it
be
nearly
dark
)
,
my
father
rise
up
.
<EOS>
He
take
hold
of
my
mother
's
arm
as
she
come
with
wild
,
sad
pace
through
one
door
,
and
quickly
towards
another
.
 
<EOS>
She
start
at
the
touch
of
his
hand
,
for
she
have
forget
all
in
the
world
but
Peter
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Molly
!
"
say
he
,
"
I
do
not
think
all
this
would
happen
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
look
into
her
face
for
comfort
 
<EOS>
her
poor
face
all
wild
and
white
;
for
neither
she
nor
my
father
have
dare
to
acknowledge
 
much
less
act
upon
 
the
terror
that
be
in
their
heart
,
lest
Peter
should
have
make
away
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
see
no
conscious
look
in
his
wife
's
hot
,
dreary
eye
,
and
he
miss
the
sympathy
that
she
have
always
be
ready
to
give
him
 
strong
man
as
he
be
,
and
at
the
dumb
despair
in
her
face
his
tear
begin
to
flow
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
she
see
this
,
a
gentle
sorrow
come
over
her
countenance
,
and
she
say
,
"
Dearest
John
!
<EOS>
do
not
cry
;
come
with
me
,
and
we
will
find
him
,
"
almost
as
cheerfully
as
if
she
know
where
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
take
my
father
's
great
hand
in
her
little
soft
one
,
and
lead
him
along
,
the
tear
drop
as
he
walk
on
that
same
unceasing
,
weary
walk
,
from
room
to
room
,
through
house
and
garden
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
how
I
wish
for
Deborah
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
time
for
crying
,
for
now
all
seem
to
depend
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
for
Deborah
to
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
send
a
message
privately
to
that
same
Mr
Holbrook
's
house
 
<EOS>
poor
Mr
Holbrook
;
 
you
know
who
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
I
send
a
message
to
him
,
but
I
send
one
that
I
could
trust
to
know
if
Peter
be
at
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
for
at
one
time
Mr
Holbrook
be
an
occasional
visitor
at
the
rectory
 
<EOS>
you
know
he
be
Miss
Pole
's
cousin
 
<EOS>
and
he
have
be
very
kind
to
Peter
,
and
teach
him
how
to
fish
 
<EOS>
he
be
very
kind
to
everybody
,
and
I
think
Peter
may
have
go
off
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
Holbrook
be
from
home
,
and
Peter
have
never
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
night
now
;
but
the
door
be
all
wide
open
,
and
my
father
and
mother
walk
on
and
on
;
it
be
more
than
an
hour
since
he
have
join
her
,
and
I
do
not
believe
they
have
ever
speak
all
that
time
.
<EOS>
I
be
get
the
parlour
fire
light
,
and
one
of
the
servant
be
prepare
tea
,
for
I
want
them
to
have
something
to
eat
and
drink
and
warm
them
,
when
old
Clare
ask
to
speak
to
me
.

I
have
borrow
the
net
from
the
weir

Miss
Matty

Shall
we
drag
the
pond
to
-
night
,
or
wait
for
the
morning

<EOS>
"
I
remember
stare
in
his
face
to
gather
his
meaning
;
and
when
I
do
,
I
laugh
out
loud
.
 
<EOS>
the
horror
of
that
new
thought
 
our
bright
,
<EOS>
darle
Peter
,
cold
,
and
stark
,
and
dead
!
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
ring
of
my
own
laugh
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
next
day
Deborah
be
at
home
before
I
be
myself
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
be
so
weak
as
to
give
way
as
I
have
do
;
but
my
scream
(
my
horrible
laughter
have
end
in
cry
)
have
rouse
my
sweet
dear
mother
,
whose
poor
wander
wit
be
call
back
and
collect
as
soon
as
a
child
need
her
care

<EOS>
She
and
Deborah
sit
by
my
bedside
;
I
know
by
the
look
of
each
that
there
have
be
no
news
of
Peter
 
<EOS>
no
awful
,
ghastly
news
,
which
be
what
I
most
have
dread
in
my
dull
state
between
sleep
and
wake
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
same
result
of
all
the
searching
have
bring
something
of
the
same
relief
to
my
mother

to
whom
,
I
be
sure
,
<EOS>
the
thought
that
Peter
may
even
then
be
hang
dead
in
some
of
the
familiar
home
place

cause
that
never

end
walk
of
yesterday

Her
soft
eye
never

the

again
after
that

they
have
always
a
restless

crave
look

as
if
seek
for
what
they
could
not
find

oh

it
be
an
awful
time

come
down

He

yet
he
only
do
what
he
think

perhaps
he
have
be
too
severe

and
perhaps
I

that
spring
day

battle
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
,
and
lick
those
French
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
see
you
again
before
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
she
be
too
late
,
"
say
Miss
Matty
;
"
too
late
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
sit
in
silence
,
ponder
on
the
full
meaning
of
those
sad
,
sad
word
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
I
ask
Miss
Matty
to
tell
me
how
her
mother
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
"
she
be
patience
itself
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
never
be
strong
,
and
this
weaken
her
terribly
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
use
to
sit
look
at
her
:
 
far
more
sad
than
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
as
if
he
could
look
at
nothing
else
when
she
be
by
;
and
he
be
so
humble
 
<EOS>
so
very
gentle
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
,
perhaps
,
speak
in
his
old
way
 
lay
down
the
law
,
as
it
be
 
and
then
,
in
a
minute
or
two
,
he
would
come
round
and
put
his
hand
on
our
shoulder
,
and
ask
us
in
a
low
voice
,
if
he
have
say
anything
to
hurt
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
at
his
speak
so
to
Deborah
,
for
she
be
so
clever
;
but
I
could
not
bear
to
hear
him
talk
so
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
you
see
,
he
see
what
we
do
not
 
that
it
be
kill
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
kill
her
(
put
out
the
candle
,
my
dear
;
I
can
talk
better
in
the
dark
)
,
for
she
be
but
a
frail
woman
,
and
ill
-
fit
to
stand
the
fright
and
shock
she
have
go
through
;
and
she
would
smile
at
him
and
comfort
him
,
not
in
word
,
but
in
her
look
and
tone
,
which
be
always
cheerful
when
he
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
would
speak
of
how
she
think
Peter
stand
a
good
chance
of
be
admiral
very
soon
 
<EOS>
he
be
so
brave
and
clever
;
and
<EOS>
how
she
think
of
see
him
in
his
navy
uniform
,
and
what
sort
of
hat
admiral
wear
;
and
how
much
more
fit
he
be
to
be
a
sailor
than
a
clergyman
;
and
all
in
that
way
,
just
to
make
my
father
think
she
be
quite
glad
of
what
come
of
that
unlucky
morning
's
work
,
and
the
flogging
which
be
always
in
his
mind
,
as
we
all
know
.
 
<EOS>
but
oh
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
the
bitter
,
bitter
cry
she
have
when
she
be
alone
;
and
at
last
,
as
she
grow
weak
,
she
could
not
keep
her
tear
in
when
Deborah
or
me
be
by
,
and
would
give
us
message
after
message
for
Peter
<EOS>
(
his
ship
have
go
to
the
Mediterranean
,
or
somewhere
down
there
,
and
then
he
be
order
off
to
India
,
and
there
be
no
overland
route
then
)
;
but
she
still
say
that
no
one
know
where
their
death
lie
in
wait
,
and
that
we
be
not
to
think
hers
be
near
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
think
it
,
but
we
know
it
,
as
we
see
her
fade
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
it
be
very
foolish
of
me
,
I
know
,
when
in
all
likelihood
I
be
so
near
see
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
only
think
,
love
!
<EOS>
the
very
day
after
her
death
 
<EOS>
for
she
do
not
live
quite
a
twelvemonth
after
Peter
go
away
 
the
very
day
after
 
come
a
parcel
for
her
from
India
 
from
her
poor
boy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
,
soft
,
white
indian
shawl
,
with
just
a
little
narrow
border
all
round
;
just
what
my
mother
would
have
like
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
think
it
may
rouse
my
father
,
for
he
have
sit
with
her
hand
in
his
all
night
long
;
so
Deborah
take
it
in
to
him
,
and
Peter
's
letter
to
her
,
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
he
take
no
notice
;
and
we
try
to
make
a
kind
of
light
careless
talk
about
the
shawl
,
open
it
out
and
admire
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
suddenly
,
he
get
up
,
and
speak
:
 
"
She
shall
be
bury
in
it
,
"
he
say
;
"
Peter
shall
have
that
comfort
;
and
she
would
have
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
perhaps
it
be
not
reasonable
,
but
what
could
we
do
or
say
?
<EOS>
one
give
people
in
grief
their
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
it
up
and
feel
it
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
such
a
shawl
as
she
wish
for
when
she
be
married
,
and
her
mother
do
not
give
it
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
of
it
till
after
,
or
she
should
have
have
it
 
<EOS>
she
should
;
but
she
shall
have
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
look
so
lovely
in
her
death
!
 
<EOS>
She
be
always
pretty
,
and
now
she
look
fair
,
and
waxen
,
and
young
 
young
than
Deborah
,
as
she
stand
tremble
and
shiver
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
We
deck
her
in
the
long
soft
fold
;
she
lie
smile
,
as
if
pleased
;
and
people
come
 
all
Cranford
come
 
to
beg
to
see
her
,
for
they
have
love
her
dearly
,
as
well
they
may
;
and
the
countrywoman
bring
posy
;
old
Clare
's
wife
bring
some
white
violet
and
beg
they
may
lie
on
her
breast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Deborah
say
to
me
,
the
day
of
my
mother
's
funeral
,
that
if
she
have
a
hundred
offer
she
never
would
marry
and
leave
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
likely
she
would
have
so
many
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
she
have
one
;
but
it
be
not
less
to
her
credit
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
such
a
daughter
to
my
father
as
I
think
there
never
be
before
or
since
.
<EOS>
His
eye
fail
him
,
and
she
read
book
after
book
,
and
write
,
and
copy
,
and
be
always
at
his
service
in
any
parish
business
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
do
many
more
thing
than
my
poor
mother
could
;
she
even
once
write
a
letter
to
the
bishop
for
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
miss
my
mother
sorely
;
the
whole
parish
notice
it
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
he
be
less
active
;
I
think
he
be
more
so
,
and
more
patient
in
help
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
all
I
could
to
set
Deborah
at
liberty
to
be
with
him
;
for
I
know
I
be
good
for
little
,
and
that
my
good
work
in
the
world
be
to
do
odd
job
quietly
,
and
set
other
at
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
father
be
a
changed
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Mr
Peter
ever
come
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
once
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
home
a
lieutenant
;
he
do
not
get
to
be
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
and
my
father
be
such
friend
!
 
<EOS>
My
father
take
him
into
every
house
in
the
parish
,
he
be
so
proud
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
walk
out
without
Peter
's
arm
to
lean
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Deborah
use
to
smile
<EOS>
(
I
do
not
think
we
ever
laugh
again
after
my
mother
's
death
)
,
and
say
she
be
quite
put
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
not
but
what
my
father
always
want
her
when
there
be
letter
-
writing
or
read
to
be
do
,
or
anything
to
be
settle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
?
"
say
I
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
Peter
go
to
sea
again
;
and
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
my
father
die
,
bless
us
both
,
and
thank
Deborah
for
all
she
have
be
to
him
;
and
,
of
course
,
our
circumstance
be
change
;
and
,
instead
of
live
at
the
rectory
,
and
keep
three
maid
and
a
man
,
we
have
to
come
to
this
small
house
,
and
be
content
with
a
servant
-
of
-
all-
work
;
but
,
as
Deborah
use
to
say
,
we
have
always
live
genteelly
,
even
if
circumstance
have
compel
us
to
simplicity
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Deborah
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
Mr
Peter
?
"
ask
I.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
there
be
some
great
war
in
India
 
<EOS>
I
forget
what
they
call
it
 
<EOS>
and
we
have
never
hear
of
Peter
since
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
dead
myself
;
and
it
sometimes
fidget
me
that
we
have
never
put
on
mourn
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
again
,
when
I
sit
by
myself
,
and
all
the
house
be
still
,
I
think
I
hear
his
step
come
up
the
street
,
and
my
heart
begin
to
flutter
and
beat
;
but
the
sound
always
go
past
 
and
Peter
never
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
Martha
back
?
 
<EOS>
no
!
 
<EOS>
I'LL
go
,
my
dear
;
I
can
always
find
my
way
in
the
dark
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
and
a
blow
of
fresh
air
at
the
door
will
do
my
head
good
,
and
it
be
rather
get
a
trick
of
ache
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
she
patter
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
light
the
candle
,
to
give
the
room
a
cheerful
appearance
against
her
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
Martha
?
"
ask
I.
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
rather
uncomfortable
,
for
I
hear
such
a
strange
noise
,
just
as
I
be
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
?
"
I
ask
,
for
her
eye
be
round
with
affright
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
street
 
just
outside
 
it
sound
like
"
     
"
talk
?

I
put
in
,
as
she
hesitate
a
little

<EOS>

no

"
      
VISITING
 
<EOS>
one
morning
,
as
Miss
Matty
and
I
sit
at
our
work
 
<EOS>
it
be
before
twelve
o'clock
,
and
Miss
Matty
have
not
change
the
cap
with
yellow
ribbon
that
have
be
Miss
Jenkyns
's
good
,
and
which
Miss
Matty
be
now
wear
out
in
private
,
put
on
the
one
make
in
imitation
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
at
all
time
when
she
expect
to
be
see
 
Martha
come
up
,
and
ask
if
Miss
Betty
Barker
may
speak
to
her
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
assent
,
and
quickly
disappear
to
change
the
yellow
ribbon
,
while
Miss
Barker
come
upstairs
;
but
,
as
she
have
forget
her
spectacle
,
and
be
rather
flurry
by
the
unusual
time
of
the
visit
,
I
be
not
surprised
to
see
her
return
with
one
cap
on
the
top
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
quite
unconscious
of
it
herself
,
and
look
at
us
,
with
bland
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
I
think
Miss
Barker
perceive
it
;
for
,
put
aside
the
little
circumstance
that
she
be
not
so
young
as
she
have
be
,
she
be
very
much
absorb
in
her
errand
,
which
she
deliver
herself
of
with
an
oppressive
modesty
that
find
vent
in
endless
apology
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Betty
Barker
be
the
daughter
of
the
old
clerk
at
Cranford
who
have
officiate
in
Mr
Jenkyns
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
her
sister
have
have
pretty
good
situation
as
lady
'
maid
,
and
have
save
money
enough
to
set
up
a
milliner
's
shop
,
which
have
be
patronise
by
the
lady
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Arley
,
for
instance
,
would
occasionally
give
Miss
Barkers
the
pattern
of
an
old
cap
of
her
,
which
they
immediately
copy
and
circulate
among
the
elite
of
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
the
elite
,
for
Miss
Barkers
have
catch
the
trick
of
the
place
,
and
pique
themselves
upon
their
"
aristocratic
connection
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
would
not
sell
their
cap
and
ribbon
to
anyone
without
a
pedigree
.
 
<EOS>
many
a
farmer
's
wife
or
daughter
turn
away
huffed
from
Miss
Barkers
'
select
millinery
,
and
go
rather
to
the
universal
shop
,
where
the
profit
of
brown
soap
and
moist
sugar
enable
the
proprietor
to
go
straight
to
(
Paris
,
he
say
,
until
he
find
his
customer
too
patriotic
and
John
Bullish
to
wear
what
the
Mounseers
wear
)
<EOS>
London
,
where
,
as
he
often
tell
his
customer
,
Queen
Adelaide
have
appear
,
only
the
very
week
before
,
in
a
cap
exactly
like
the
one
he
show
them
,
trim
with
yellow
and
blue
ribbon
,
and
have
be
compliment
by
King
William
on
the
become
nature
of
her
head
-
dress
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Barkers
,
who
confine
themselves
to
truth
,
and
do
not
approve
of
miscellaneous
customer
,
throve
notwithstanding
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
self
-
deny
,
good
people
.
 
<EOS>
many
a
time
<EOS>
have
I
see
the
eld
of
them
(
she
that
have
be
maid
to
Mrs
Jamieson
)
carry
out
some
delicate
mess
to
a
poor
person
.
 
<EOS>
They
only
ape
their
better
in
have
"
nothing
to
do
"
with
the
class
immediately
below
theirs
.
<EOS>
and
when
Miss
Barker
die
,
their
profit
and
income
be
find
to
be
such
that
Miss
Betty
be
justified
in
shut
up
shop
and
retire
from
business
.
 
<EOS>
She
also
(
as
I
think
I
have
before
say
)
set
up
her
cow
;
a
mark
of
respectability
in
Cranford
almost
as
decide
as
set
up
a
gig
be
among
some
people
.
 
<EOS>
She
dress
fine
than
any
lady
in
Cranford
;
and
we
do
not
wonder
at
it
;
for
it
be
understand
that
she
be
wear
out
all
the
bonnet
and
cap
and
outrageous
ribbon
which
have
once
form
her
stock
-
in
-
trade
.
<EOS>
It
be
five
or
six
year
since
she
have
give
up
shop
,
so
in
any
other
place
than
Cranford
her
dress
may
have
be
consider
passee
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
Miss
Betty
Barker
have
call
to
invite
Miss
Matty
to
tea
at
her
house
on
the
follow
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
She
give
me
also
an
impromptu
invitation
,
as
I
happen
to
be
a
visitor
 
though
I
could
see
she
have
a
little
fear
lest
,
since
my
father
have
go
to
live
in
Drumble
,
he
may
have
engage
in
that
"
horrid
cotton
trade
,
"
and
so
drag
his
family
down
out
of
"
aristocratic
society
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
preface
this
invitation
with
so

my

"
Her
presumption

<EOS>
what
have
she
be
do
?
 
<EOS>
She
seem
so
over
-
power
by
it
<EOS>
I
could
only
think
that
she
have
be
write
to
<EOS>
Queen
Adelaide
to
ask
for
a
receipt
for
wash
lace
;
<EOS>
but
the
act
which
she
so
characterise
be
only
an
invitation
she
have
carry
to
her
sister
's
former
mistress
,
Mrs
Jamieson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
former
occupation
consider
,
could
miss
Matty
excuse
the
liberty

"
 
<EOS>
ah

<EOS>
think
<EOS>
I
,
she
have
find
out
that
double
cap

be
go
to
rectify
Miss
Matty

head

dress

<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
it
be
simply
to
extend
her
invitation
to
Miss
Matty
and
to
me
.
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
bow
acceptance
;
and
I
wonder
that
,
in
the
graceful
action
,
she
do
not
feel
the
unusual
weight
and
extraordinary
height
of
her
head

dress

<EOS>
but
I
do
not
think
she
do
,
for
she
recover
her
balance
,
and
go
on
talk
to
Miss
Betty
in
a
kind
,
condescending
manner
,
very
different
from
the
fidgety
way
she
would
have
have
if
she
have
suspect
how
singular
her
appearance
be

<EOS>
Mrs

one

that

I

Mrs

Mrs

<EOS>
I
have
the
great
respect
for
Mrs
Fitz

Adam
 
<EOS>

I
can
not

her
fit
society

<EOS>
Miss

bow
low

up

She
look

sidelong

half

as
possible

<EOS>
Mrs

dine
at
five

but
have
kindly
promise
not
to
delay
her
visit
beyond
that
time
 
half
-
past
six
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
with
a
swimming
curtsey
Miss
Betty
Barker
take
her
leave
.
  
<EOS>
My
prophetic
soul
foretold
a
visit
that
afternoon
from
Miss
Pole
,
who
usually
come
to
call
on
Miss
Matilda
after
any
event
 
or
indeed
in
sight
of
any
event
 
to
talk
it
over
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Betty
tell
me
it
be
to
be
a
choice
and
select
few
,
"
say
Miss
Pole
,
as
she
and
Miss
Matty
compare
note
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
so
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
not
even
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
be
the
widow
sister
of
the
Cranford
surgeon
,
whom
I
have
name
before
.
 
<EOS>
Their
parent
be
respectable
farmer
,
content
with
their
station
.
 
<EOS>
the
name
of
these
good
people
be
Hoggins
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hoggins
be
the
Cranford
doctor
now
;
we
dislike
the
name
and
consider
it
coarse
;
but
,
as
Miss
Jenkyns
say
,
if
he
change
it
to
Piggins
it
would
not
be
much
well
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
hope
to
discover
a
relationship
between
him
and
that
Marchioness
of
Exeter
whose
name
be
Molly
Hoggins
;
but
the
man
,
careless
of
his
own
interest
,
utterly
ignore
and
deny
any
such
relationship
,
although
,
as
dear
Miss
Jenkyns
have
say
,
he
have
a
sister
call
Mary
,
and
the
same
christian
name
be
very
apt
to
run
in
family
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
Miss
Mary
Hoggins
marry
Mr
Fitz
-
Adam
,
she
disappear
from
the
neighbourhood
for
many
year
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
move
in
a
sphere
in
Cranford
society
sufficiently
high
to
make
any
of
us
care
to
know
what
Mr
Fitz
-
Adam
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
die
and
be
gather
to
his
father
without
our
ever
have
think
about
him
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
reappear
in
Cranford
(
"
as
bold
as
a
lion
,
"
Miss
Pole
say
)
,
a
well
-
to
-
do
widow
,
dress
in
rustle
black
silk
,
so
soon
after
her
husband
's
death
that
poor
Miss
Jenkyns
be
justify
in
the
remark
she
make
,
that
"
bombazine
would
have
show
a
deep
sense
of
her
loss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
remember
the
convocation
of
lady
who
assemble
to
decide
whether
or
not
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
should
be
call
upon
by
the
old
blue
-
blooded
inhabitant
of
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
take
a
large
rambling
house
,
which
have
be
usually
consider
to
confer
a
patent
of
gentility
upon
its
tenant
,
because
,
once
upon
a
time
,
seventy
or
eighty
year
before
,
the
spinster
daughter
of
an
earl
have
reside
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
if
the
inhabit
this
house
be
not
also
believe
to
convey
some
unusual
power
of
intellect
;
for
the
earl
's
daughter
,
Lady
Jane
,
have
a
sister
,
Lady
Anne
,
who
have
marry
a
general
officer
in
the
time
of
the
american
war
,
and
this
general
officer
have
write
one
or
two
comedy
,
which
be
still
act
on
the
London
board
,
and
which
,
when
we
see
them
advertise
,
make
us
all
draw
up
,
and
feel
that
Drury
Lane
be
pay
a
very
pretty
compliment
to
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
it
be
not
at
all
a
settle
thing
that
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
be
to
be
visit
,
when
dear
Miss
Jenkyns
die
;
and
,
with
her
,
something
of
the
clear
knowledge
of
the
strict
code
of
gentility
go
out
too
.
 
<EOS>
as
Miss
Pole
observe
,
"
as
most
of
the
lady
of
good
family
in
Cranford
be
elderly
spinster
,
or
widow
without
child
,
if
we
do
not
relax
a
little
,
and
become
less
exclusive
,
by
-
and
-
<EOS>
by
we
should
have
no
society
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
continue
on
the
same
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
always
understand
that
Fitz
mean
something
aristocratic
;
there
be
Fitz
-
Roy
 
<EOS>
she
think
that
some
of
the
King
's
child
have
be
call
Fitz
-
Roy
;
and
there
be
Fitz
-
Clarence
<EOS>
,
now
 
they
be
the
child
of
dear
good
King
William
the
fourth
.
 
<EOS>
Fitz
-
Adam
!
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
pretty
name
,
and
she
think
it
very
probably
mean
"
Child
of
Adam
.
"
 
<EOS>
no
one
,
who
have
not
some
good
blood
in
their
vein
,
would
dare
to
be
call
Fitz
;
there
be
a
deal
in
a
name
 
she
have
have
<EOS>
a
cousin
who
spelt
his
name
with
two
little
ff
 
ffoulke
 
and
he
always
look
down
upon
capital
letter
and
say
they
belong
to
lately
-
invent
family
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
afraid
he
would
die
a
bachelor
<EOS>
,
he
be
so
very
choice
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
meet
with
a
Mrs
ffarringdon
,
at
a
watering
-
place
,
he
take
to
her
immediately
;
and
a
very
pretty
genteel
woman
<EOS>
she
be
 
a
widow
,
with
a
very
good
fortune
;
and
"
my
cousin
,
"
Mr
ffoulke
,
marry
her
;
and
it
be
all
owe
to
her
two
little
ff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
do
not
stand
a
chance
of
meet
with
a
Mr
Fitz
-
anything
in
Cranford
,
so
that
could
not
have
be
her
motive
for
settle
there
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
think
it
may
have
be
the
hope
of
be
admit
into
the
society
of
the
place
,
which
would
certainly
be
a
very
agreeable
rise
for
ci
-
devant
Miss
Hoggins
;
and
if
this
have
be
her
hope
it
would
be
cruel
to
disappoint
her
.
  
<EOS>
so
everybody
call
upon
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
 
everybody
but
Mrs
Jamieson
,
who
use
to
show
how
honourable
she
be
by
never
see
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
when
they
meet
at
the
Cranford
party
.
 
<EOS>
there
would
be
only
eight
or
ten
lady
in
the
room
,
and
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
be
the
large
of
all
,
and
she
invariably
use
to
stand
up
when
Mrs
Jamieson
come
in
,
and
curtsey
very
low
to
her
whenever
she
turn
in
her
direction
 
so
low
,
in
fact
,
that
I
think
Mrs
Jamieson
must
have
look
at
the
wall
above
her
,
for
she
never
move
a
muscle
of
her
face
,
no
more
than
if
she
have
not
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
still
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
persevere
.
  
<EOS>
the
spring
evening
be
get
bright
and
long
when
three
or
four
lady
in
calash
meet
at
Miss
Barker
's
door
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
what
a
calash
be
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
covering
wear
over
cap
,
not
unlike
the
head
fasten
on
old
-
fashioned
gig
;
but
sometimes
it
be
not
quite
so
large
.
 
<EOS>
this
kind
of
head
-
gear
always
make
an
awful
impression
on
the
child
in
Cranford
;
and
now
two
or
three
leave
off
their
play
in
the
quiet
sunny
little
street
,
and
gather
in
wonder
silence
round
Miss
Pole
,
Miss
Matty
,
and
myself
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
silent
too
,
so
that
we
could
hear
loud
,
suppress
whisper
inside
Miss
Barker
's
house
:
 
<EOS>
"
wait
,
Peggy
!
<EOS>
wait
till
I
have
run
upstairs
and
wash
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
cough
,
open
the
door
;
I
will
not
be
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
,
true
enough
it
be
not
a
minute
before
we
hear
a
noise
,
between
a
sneeze
and
a
crow
;
on
which
the
door
fly
open
.
 
<EOS>
behind
it
stand
a
round
-
eyed
maiden
,
<EOS>
all
aghast
at
the
honourable
company
of
calash
,
who
march
in
without
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
She
recover
presence
of
mind
enough
to
usher
us
into
a
small
room
,
which
have
be
the
shop
,
but
be
now
convert
into
a
temporary
dressing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
there
we
unpin
and
shake
ourselves
,
and
arrange
our
feature
before
the
glass
into
a
sweet
and
gracious
company
-
face
;
and
then
,
bow
backwards
with
"
after
you
,
madam
,
"
we
allow
Mrs
Forrester
to
take
precedence
up
the
narrow
staircase
that
lead
to
Miss
Barker
's
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
there
she
sit
,
as
stately
and
compose
as
though
we
have
never
hear
that
odd
-
sound
cough
,
from
which
her
throat
must
have
be
even
then
sore
and
rough
.
 
<EOS>
Kind
,
gentle
,
shabbily
-
dress
Mrs
Forrester
be
immediately
conduct
to
the
second
place
of
honour
 
a
seat
arrange
something
like
Prince
Albert
be
near
the
Queen
's
 
good
,
but
not
so
good
.
 
<EOS>
the
place
of
pre
-
eminence
be
,
of
course
,
reserve
for
the
honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
,
who
presently
come
pant
up
the
stair
 
<EOS>
carlo
rush
round
her
on
her
progress
,
as
if
he
mean
to
trip
her
up
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
Miss
Betty
Barker
be
a
proud
and
happy
woman
!
 
<EOS>
She
stir
the
fire
,
and
shut
the
door
,
and
sit
as
near
to
it
as
she
could
,
quite
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
.
 
<EOS>
when
Peggy
come
in
,
totter
under
the
weight
of
the
tea
-
tray
,
I
notice
that
Miss
Barker
be
sadly
afraid
lest
Peggy
should
not
keep
her
distance
sufficiently
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
mistress
be
on
very
familiar
term
in
their
every
-
day
intercourse
,
and
Peggy
want
now
to
make
several
little
confidence
to
her
,
which
Miss
Barker
be
on
thorn
to
hear
,
but
which
she
think
it
her
duty
,
as
a
lady
,
to
repress
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
turn
away
from
all
Peggy
's
aside
and
sign
;
but
she
make
one
or
two
very
malapropos
answer
to
what
be
say
;
and
at
last
<EOS>
,
seize
with
a
bright
idea
,
she
exclaim
,
"
poor
,
sweet
Carlo
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
forget
him
.
 
<EOS>
come
downstairs
with
me
,
poor
ittie
doggie
,
and
it
shall
have
its
tea
,
it
shall
!
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
she
return
,
bland
and
benignant
as
before
;
but
I
think
she
have
forget
to
give
the
"
poor
ittie
doggie
"
anything
to
eat
,
judge
by
the
avidity
with
which
he
swallow
down
chance
piece
of
cake
.
 
<EOS>
the
tea
-
tray
be
abundantly
load
 
<EOS>
I
be
pleased
to
see
it
<EOS>
,
I
be
so
hungry
;
but
I
be
afraid
the
lady
present
may
think
it
vulgarly
heap
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
they
would
have
do
at
their
own
house
;
but
somehow
the
heap
disappear
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
Mrs
Jamieson
eat
seed
-
cake
,
slowly
and
considerately
,
as
she
do
everything
;
and
I
be
rather
surprised
,
for
I
know
she
have
tell
us
,
on
the
occasion
of
her
last
party
,
that
she
never
have
it
in
her
house
<EOS>
,
it
remind
her
so

Mrs

kindly
indulgent
to
Miss
Barker
's
want
of
knowledge
of
the
custom
of
high
life

to
spare
her
feeling

eat
three
large
piece
of

cake

with
a
placid

ruminate
expression
of
countenance
,
not
unlike
a

<EOS>
after
tea
there
be
some
little
demur
and
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
six
in
number
;
four
could
play
at
Preference
,
and
for
the
other
two
there

Cribbage

<EOS>
but
all
,
except
myself
(
I
be
rather
afraid
of
the
Cranford
lady
at
card

it

the
most
earnest
and
serious
business
they
ever
engage
in

<EOS>
even
Miss
Barker

while
declare
she
do
not
know
Spadille
from
Manille
,
be
evidently
hanker
to
take
a
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
dilemma
be
soon
put
an
end
to
by
a
singular
kind
of
noise
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
baron
's
daughter
-
in

law
could
ever
be
suppose
to
snore
,
I
should
have
say
Mrs
Jamieson
do
so
then
;
for
,
overcome
by
the
heat
of
the
room
,
and
incline
to
doze
by
nature
,
the
temptation
of
that
very
comfortable
arm

chair
have
be
too
much
for
her
,
and
Mrs
Jamieson
be
nod
.
 
<EOS>
once
or
twice
she
open
her
eye
with
an
effort
,
and
calmly
but
unconsciously
smile
upon
us
;
but
by
-
and
-
by
,
even
her
benevolence
be
not
equal
to
this
exertion
,
and
she
be
sound
asleep

<EOS>
"
It

very
gratifying

whisper
Miss

at

her

,
notwithstanding

Miss

<EOS>
It

very
difficult
to

clear
between
Mrs

's
deafness
and
Mrs

's
sleepiness
.
 
<EOS>
but
Miss
Barker
manage
her
arduous
task
well

<EOS>
She
repeat
the

to
Mrs

distort
her

considerably

in

to
show

by
the
motion

then
she
smile
kindly
all
round
at

murmur
to
herself
,
"

presently
the

wide
open

Carlo
start
to
his
foot

with
a
loud
snapping
bark
,
and
Mrs
Jamieson
awake
:
 
or
,
perhaps
,
she
have
not
be
asleep
 
as
she
say
almost
directly
,
the
room
have
be
so
light
she
have
be
glad
to
keep
her

shut

have
be

with
great

nay

I

although
she
do

,
"

Peggy

you

"
and
look
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
unexpected

<EOS>
all
sort
of
good
thing
for
supper
 
scallop
oyster
,
pot
lobster
,
jelly
,
a
dish
call
"
little
Cupids
"
(
which
be
in
great
favour
with
the
Cranford

,
although
too
expensive
to
be
give
,
except
on
solemn
and
state
occasion
 
macaroon
sop

I
should
have
call
it

if
I
have
not
know
its
more
refined
and
classical
name
)
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
we
be
evidently
to
be
feast
with
all
that
be
sweetest
and
good
;
and
we
think
it
better
to
submit
graciously
,
even
at
the
cost
of
our
gentility
 
which
never
eat
supper
in
general
,
but
which
,
like
most
non-
supper

eater
,
be
particularly
hungry
on
all
special

<EOS>
Miss
Barker
,
in
her
former
sphere
,
have
,
I
daresay
,
be
make
acquainted
with
the
beverage
they
call
cherry
-
brandy
.
 
<EOS>
We
none
of
us
have
ever
see
such
a
thing
,
and
rather
shrink
back
when
she
proffer
it
<EOS>
us
 
<EOS>
"
just
a
little
,
leetle
glass
,
lady
;
after
the
oyster
and
lobster
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Shell
-
fish
be
sometimes
think
not
very
wholesome
.
"
 
<EOS>
We
all
shake
our
head
like
female
mandarin
;
but
,
at
last
,
Mrs
Jamieson
suffer
herself
to
be
persuade
,
and
we
follow
her
lead
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
exactly
unpalatable
,
though
so
hot
and
so
strong
<EOS>
that
we
think
ourselves
bind
to
give
evidence
that
we
be
not
accustom
to
such
thing
by
cough
terribly
 
almost
as
strangely
as
Miss
Barker
have
do
,
before
we
be
admit
by
Peggy
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
strong
,
"
say
Miss
Pole
,
as
she
put
down
her
empty
glass
;
"
I
do
believe
there
be
spirit
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
a
little
drop
 
just
necessary
to
make
it
keep

"
say
Miss
Barker
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
we
put
brandy

pepper
over

<EOS>
I
often

tipsy
myself
from

"
  
<EOS>
I
question
whether
damson
tart
would
have
open
Mrs
Jamieson
's
heart
as
the
cherry
-
brandy
do
;
but
she
tell
us
of
a
come
event
,
respect
which
she
have
be
quite
silent
till
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
My

Lady
Glenmire

come
to
stay

me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
chorus
of
"
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
each
one
rapidly
review
her
wardrobe
,
as
to
its
fitness
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
a
baron
's
widow
;
for
,
of
course
,
a
series
of
small
festival
be
always
hold
in
Cranford
on
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
at
any
of
our
friend
'
house

<EOS>
We
feel
very
pleasantly
excited
on
the
present
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
not
long
after
this
the
maid
and
the
lantern
be
announce
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
have
the
sedan

chair
,
which
have
squeeze
itself
into
Miss
Barker
's
narrow
lobby
with
some
difficulty
,
and
most
literally
"
stop
the
way

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
require
some
skilful
manoeuvring
on
the
part
of
the
old
chairman
(
shoemaker
by
day
,
but
when
summon
to
carry
the
sedan
dress
up
in
a
strange
old
livery
 
long
great

coat
,
with
small
cape

coeval
with
the

and
similar
to
the

try
at

and
finally
to
succeed
in
carry
their
burden
out
of
Miss
Barker

front
door

<EOS>
then
we
hear
<EOS>
their
quick
pit
-
a-
pat
along
the
quiet
little
street
as
we
put
on
our
calash
and
pin
up
our
gown
;
Miss
Barker
hover
about
us
with
offer
of
help
,
which
,
if
she
have
not
remember
her
former
occupation

would
have
be
much
more

<EOS>
"
your

early
the
next
morning
 
directly
after
twelve
 
Miss
Pole
make
her
appearance
at
Miss
Matty

.
 
<EOS>
some
very
trifling
piece
of
business
be
allege
as
a
reason
for
the
call
;
but
there
be
evidently
something
behind
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
out
it
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
by
the
way
,
you
will
think
I
be
strangely
ignorant

do
you

puzzle
how

do

I
have
be
puzzle
all
morning

and
be
we
to
say
"
My

"
instead
of

madam

"
 
<EOS>
now
you
know
Lady

will
you
kindly
tell
me
the

<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Matty
!
<EOS>
she
take
off
her
spectacle
and
she
put
them
on
again
 
<EOS>
but
how
Lady
Arley
be
address
,
she
could
not
remember
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
long
ago
,
"
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
dear

<EOS>

<EOS>
how
stupid
I
be

<EOS>
I
do
not

I
ever

her
more

twice

<EOS>
I
know
we
use
to
call
Sir

"

in

<EOS>
"
My

<EOS>
It
sound
very
strange

as
if
it
be
not
natural

<EOS>
I
never

of
it
before

but
,
now
you
have
name
it

I
be
all
in
a
puzzle

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
certain
Miss
Pole
would
obtain
no
wise
decision
from
Miss
Matty
,
who
get
more
bewilder
every
moment
,
and
more
perplexed
as
to
etiquette
of
address

<EOS>
"
well
,
I
really
think
,
"
say
Miss

,
"
I
have
well
just
go
and
tell
Mrs
Forrester
about
our
little
difficulty

<EOS>
one
sometimes
grow
nervous
;
and
yet
one
would
not
have
<EOS>
Lady

think
we
be
quite
ignorant

the
etiquette

life

and
will
you
just
step
in
here
,
dear
Miss

as
you
come
back
,
please

and
tell
me
what
you
decide
upon
?
 
<EOS>
whatever
you
and
Mrs

fix
upon

will
be
quite
right

I
be
sure

<EOS>
"
Lady
Arley
,
"
"
Sir
Peter
,
"
say
Miss
Matty
to
herself
,
try
to
recall
the
old
form
of
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
Lady
Glenmire
?
"
ask
I.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
she
be
the
widow

Mr

<EOS>

be
Mrs

daughter

<EOS>
"
Your

"
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
if
they
fix
on
that
way
of
speak
,
you
must
just
let
me
practice
a
little
on
you
first
,
for
I
shall
feel
so
foolish
and
hot
say
it
the
first
time
to
Lady
Glenmire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
really
a
relief
to
Miss
Matty
when
Mrs
Jamieson
come
on
a
very
unpolite
errand
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
that
apathetic
people
have
more
quiet
impertinence
than
other
;
and
Mrs
Jamieson
come
now
to
insinuate
pretty
plainly
that
she
do
not
particularly
wish
that
the
Cranford
lady
should
call
upon
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
say
how
she
make
this
clear
;
for
I
grow
very
indignant
and
warm
,
while
with
slow
deliberation
she
be
explain
her
wish
to
Miss
Matty
,
who
,
a
true
lady
herself
,
could
hardly
understand
the
feeling
which
make
Mrs
Jamieson
wish
to
appear
to
her
noble
sister-
in
-
law
as
if
she
only
visit
"
county
"
family
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
remain
puzzled
and
perplex
long
after
I
have
find
out
the
object
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
visit
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
do
understand
the
drift
of
the
honourable
lady
's
call
,
it
be
pretty
to
see
with
what
quiet
dignity
<EOS>
she
receive
the
intimation
thus
uncourteously
give
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
in
the
least
hurt
 
<EOS>
she
be
of
too
gentle
a
spirit
for
that
;
nor
be
she
exactly
conscious
of
disapprove
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
conduct
;
but
there
be
something
of
this
feeling
in
her
mind
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
which
make
her
pass
from
the
subject
to
other
in
a
less
flurried
and
more
compose
manner
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
be
,
indeed
,
the
more
flurried
of
the
two
,
and
I
could
see
she
be
glad
to
take
her
leave
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
while
afterwards
Miss
Pole
return
,
red
and
indignant
.
"
<EOS>
well
!
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
have
Mrs
Jamieson
here
<EOS>
,
I
find
from
Martha

and
we
be
not
to
call
on
Lady
Glenmire
.
 
<EOS>
yes
!
 
<EOS>
I
meet
Mrs
Jamieson
,
half
-
way
between
<EOS>
here
and
Mrs
Forrester

,
and
<EOS>
she
tell
me
;
she
take
me
so
by
surprise
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
think
of
something
very
sharp

sarcastic

I
dare
say
I
shall
to

night
.
 
<EOS>
and
Lady
Glenmire
be
<EOS>
but
the
widow
of
a
Scotch
baron
after
all

<EOS>
I
go
on
to
look
at
Mrs
Forrester

Peerage

to
see
who
this
lady
be

that
be
to
be
keep
under
a
glass
case

widow
of
a
Scotch
peer
 
never
sit
in
the
House
of
Lords
 
and
as
poor
as
job
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
and
she
 
fifth
daughter
of
some
Mr
Campbell
or
other
.
<EOS>
You
be
the
daughter
of
a
rector
,
at
any
rate
,
and
relate
to
the
Arleys

may
have
be
Viscount
Arley

every
one
say

Miss
Pole

in
vain

<EOS>
that
lady

usually
so
kind
and
good

humoured

be
now
in
a
full
flow
of
anger

<EOS>
"
and
I
go
and
order
a
cap
this
morning

to
be
quite
ready

she
at
last

let
out
the
secret
which
give
ste

Mrs
Jamieson
's
intimation

<EOS>
"
Mrs
Jamieson
shall
see
if
it
be
so
easy
to
get
me
to
make
fourth
at
a
pool
when
she

her
fine
Scotch
relation

"
  
<EOS>
in
come
out
of
church
,
the
first
Sunday
on
which
Lady
Glenmire
appear
in
Cranford
,
we
sedulously
talk
together
,
and
turn
our
back
on
Mrs
Jamieson
and
her
guest
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
may
not
call
on
her
,
we
would
not
even
look
at
her
,
though
we
be
die
with
curiosity
to
know
what
she
be
like
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
the
comfort
of
question
Martha
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
do
not
belong
to
a
sphere
of
society
whose
observation
could
be
an
implied
compliment
to
Lady
Glenmire
,
and
Martha
have
make
good
use
of
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
madam
!
<EOS>
be
it
the
little
lady
with
Mrs
Jamieson
,
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
would
like
more
to
know
how
young
Mrs
Smith
be
dress
;
her
be
a
bride
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Mrs
Smith
be
the
butcher
's
wife
)
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
say
,
"
good
gracious
me
!
<EOS>
as
if
we
care
about
a
Mrs
Smith
;
"
but
be
silent
as
Martha
resume
her
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
little
lady
in
Mrs
Jamieson
's
pew
have
on
,
madam
,
rather
an
old
black
silk
,
and
a
shepherd
's
plaid
cloak
,
madam
,
and
very
bright
<EOS>
black
eye
<EOS>
she
have
,
madam
,
and
a
pleasant
,
sharp
face
;
not
over
young
,
madam
,
but
<EOS>
yet
,
I
should
guess
,
young
than
Mrs
Jamieson
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
up
and
down
the
church
,
like
a
bird
,
and
nip
up
her
petticoat
,
when
she
come
out
,
as
quick
and
sharp
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
,
madam
,
she
be
more
like
Mrs
Deacon
,
at
the
"
Coach
and
Horses
,
"
nor
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
Martha
!
"
say
Miss
Matty

that
be
not
respectful

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
it
,
madam
?
 
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
;
but
Jem
Hearn
say
so
as
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
she
be
just
<EOS>
such
a
sharp
,
stirring
sort
of
a
body
"
     
"
Lady
,
"
say
Miss
Pole
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
 
as
Mrs
Deacon
.
"
  
<EOS>
another
Sunday
pass
away
,
and
we
still
avert
our
eye
from
Mrs
Jamieson
and
her
guest
,
and
make
remark
to
ourselves
that
we
think
be
very
severe
 
almost
too
much
so
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
be
evidently
uneasy
at
our
sarcastic
manner
of
speak
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
by
this
time
Lady
Glenmire
have
find
out
that
Mrs
Jamieson
's
be
not
the
gay
,
lively
house
in
the
world
;
perhaps
Mrs
Jamieson
have
find
out
that
most
of
the
county
family
be
in
London
,
and
that
those
who
remain
in
the
country
be
not
so
alive
as
they
may
have
be
to
the
circumstance
of
Lady
Glenmire
be
in
their
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
great
event
spring
out
of
small
cause
<EOS>
;
so
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
what
induce
Mrs
Jamieson
to
alter
her
determination
of
exclude
the
Cranford
lady
,
and
send
note
of
invitation
<EOS>
all
round
for
a
small
party
on
the
follow
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mulliner
himself
bring
them
round
.
 
<EOS>
He
WOULD
always
ignore
the
fact
of
there
be
a
back
-
door
to
any
house
,
and
give
a
loud
rat
-
tat
than
his
mistress
,
Mrs
Jamieson
.
<EOS>
He
have
three
little
note
,
which
he
carry
in
a
large
basket
,
in
order
to
impress
his
mistress
with
an
idea
of
their
great
weight
,
though
they
may
easily
have
go
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
and
I
quietly
decide
that
we
would
have
a
previous
engagement
at
home
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
evening
on
which
Miss
Matty
usually
make
candle
-
lighter
of
all
the
note
and
letter
of
the
week
;
for
on
Mondays
her
account
be
always
make
straight
 
not
a
penny
owe
from
the
week
before
;
so
,
by
a
natural
arrangement
,
make
candle
-
lighter
fall
upon
a
Tuesday
evening
,
and
give
us
a
legitimate
excuse
for
decline
Mrs
Jamieson
's
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
our
answer
be
write
,
in
come
Miss
Pole
,
with
an
open
note
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
!
"
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
have
get
your
note
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
better
late
than
never
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
tell
my
Lady
Glenmire
she
would
be
glad
enough
of
our
society
before
a
fortnight
be
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Miss
Matty
,
"
we
be
ask
for
Tuesday
evening
.
 
<EOS>
and
perhaps
you
would
just
kindly
bring
your
work
across
and
drink
tea
with
us
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
usual
regular
time
for
look
over
the
last
week
's
bill
,
and
note
,
and
letter
,
and
make
candle
-
lighter
of
them
;
but
that
do
not
seem
quite
reason
enough
for
say
I
have
a
previous
engagement
at
home
,
though
I
mean
to
make
it
do
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
if
you
would
come
,
my
conscience
would
be
quite
at
ease
,
and
luckily
the
note
be
not
write
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
see
Miss
Pole
's
countenance
change
while
Miss
Matty
be
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
mean
to
go
then
?
"
ask
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
!
"
say
,
Miss
Matty
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
either
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
reply
Miss
Pole
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
think
I
do
,
"
say
she
,
rather
briskly
;
<EOS>
and
on
see
Miss
Matty
look
surprised
,
she
add
,
"
You
see
,
one
would
not
like
Mrs
Jamieson
to
think
that
anything
she
could
do
,
or
say
,
be
of
consequence
enough
to
give
offence
;
it
would
be
a
kind
of
let
down
of
ourselves
,
that
I
,
for
one
,
should
not
like
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
too
flattering
to
Mrs
Jamieson
if
we
allow
her
to
suppose
that
what
she
have
say
affect
us
a
week
,
nay
ten
day
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
wrong
to
be
hurt
and
annoy
so
long
about
anything
;
and
,
perhaps
,
after
all
,
she
do
not
mean
to
vex
us
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
say
,
I
could
not
have
bring
myself
to
say
the
thing
Mrs
Jamieson
do
about
our
not
call
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
think
I
shall
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
come
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
,
you
must
go
;
you
know
our
friend
Mrs
Jamieson
be
much
more
phlegmatic
than
most
people
,
and
do
not
enter
into
the
little
delicacy
of
feeling
which
you
possess
in
so
remarkable
a
degree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
possess
them
,
too
,
<EOS>
that
day
Mrs
Jamieson
call
to
tell
us
not
to
go
,
"
say
Miss
Matty
innocently
.
  
<EOS>
but
Miss
Pole
,
in
addition
to
her
delicacy
of
feeling
,
possess
a
very
smart
cap
,
which
she
be
anxious
to
show
to
an
admiring
world
;
and
so
she
seem
to
forget
all
her
angry
word
utter
not
a
fortnight
before
,
and
to
be
ready
to
act
on
what
she
call
the
great
christian
principle
of
"
forgive
and
forget
"
;
and
she
lecture
dear
Miss
Matty
so
long
on
this
head
that
she
absolutely
end
by
assure
her
it
be
her
duty
,
as
a
deceased
rector
's
daughter
,
to
buy
a
new
cap
and
go
to
the
party
at
Mrs
Jamieson
's
.
 
<EOS>
so
"
we
be
most
happy
to
accept
,
"
instead
of
"
regret
that
we
be
oblige
to
decline
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
expenditure
on
dress
in
Cranford
be
principally
in
that
one
article
refer
to
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
head
be
bury
in
smart
new
cap

the
lady

like
ostrich

and
care
not
what
become
of

<EOS>
old

any
number
of

old

and
new

the
fashion
of
the
day
 
the

with
chaste
elegance

Miss

prettily
express
it

and
with
three

a
great
array
of
brooch

a
town

do
Mrs
Forrester
,
and
Miss
Matty
,
and
Miss
Pole
appear
on
that
memorable
Tuesday
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
count
seven
brooch
myself
on
Miss
Pole
's
dress
.
 
<EOS>
two
be
fix
negligently
in
her
cap

one
be

Scotch
pebble

may
believe
to
be

real
insect

one

one

one
ornament
the
front
of
her
gown

midway
between
her
throat

and
another
adorn
the
point
of
her
stomacher

<EOS>
where
the
seventh
be
I
have
forget
,
but
it
be
somewhere
about
her
,
I
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
get
on
too
fast
,
in
describe
the
dress
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
first
relate
the
gathering
on
the
way
to
Mrs
Jamieson
's
.
 
<EOS>
that
lady
live
in
a
large
house
just
outside
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
a
road
which
have
know
what
it
be
to
be
a
street
run
right
before
the
house
,
which
open
out
upon
it
without
any
intervene
garden
or
court
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
the
sun
be
about
,
he
never
shine
on
the
front
of
that
house
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
the
living
-
room
be
at
the
back
,
look
on
to
a
pleasant
garden
;
the
front
window
only
belong
to
kitchens
and
housekeeper
'
room
,
and
pantry
,
and
in
one
of
them
<EOS>
Mr
Mulliner
be
report
to
sit
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
look
askance
,
we
often
see
the
back
of
a
head
cover
with
hair
powder
,
which
also
extend
itself
over
his
coat
-
collar
down
to
his
very
waist
;
and
this
impose
back
be
always
engage
in
read
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
,
open
wide
,
which
,
in
some
degree
,
account
for
the
length
of
time
the
said
newspaper
be
in
reach
us
 
equal
subscriber
with
Mrs
Jamieson
,
though
,
in
right
of
her
honourableness
,
she
always
have
the
reading
of
it
first
.
 
<EOS>
this
very
Tuesday
,
the
delay
in
forward
the
last
number
have
be
particularly
aggravate
;
just
when
both
Miss
Pole
and
Miss
Matty
,
the
former
more
especially
,
have
be
want
to
see
it
,
in
order
to
coach
up
the
Court
news
ready
for
the
evening
's
interview
with
aristocracy
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
tell
us
she
have
absolutely
take
time
by
the
forelock
,
and
be
dress
by
five
o'clock
,
in
order
to
be
ready
if
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
should
come
in
at
the
last
moment
 
the
very
St
James
's
Chronicle
which
the
powdered
head
be
tranquilly
and
composedly
read
as
we
pass
the
accustomed
window
this
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
impudence
of
the
man
!
"
say
Miss
Pole
,
in
a
low
indignant
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
ask
him
whether
his
mistress
pay
her
quarter
-
share
for
his
exclusive
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
look
at
her
in
admiration
of
the
courage
of
her
thought
;
for
Mr
Mulliner
be
an
object
of
great
awe
to
all
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
never
to
have
forget
his
condescension
in
come
to
live
at
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
,
at
time
,
have
stand
forth
as
the
undaunted
champion
of
her
sex
,
and
speak
to
him
on
term
of
equality
;
but
even
Miss
Jenkyns
could
get
no
high
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
pleasantest
and
most
gracious
mood
he
look
like
a
sulky
cockatoo
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
speak
except
in
gruff
monosyllable
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
wait
in
the
hall
when
we
beg
him
not
to
wait
,
and
then
look
deeply
offended
because
we
have
keep
him
there
,
while
,
with
tremble
,
hasty
hand
we
prepare
ourselves
for
appear
in
company
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
venture
on
a
small
joke
as
we
go
upstairs
,
intend
,
though
address
to
us
,
to
afford
Mr
Mulliner
some
slight
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
smile
,
in
order
to
seem
as
if
we
feel
at
our
ease
,
and
timidly
look
for
Mr
Mulliner
's
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
muscle
of
that
wooden
face
have
relax
;

we
be
grave
in
an
instant

Mrs

<EOS>
Carlo
lie
on
the
worst
-
worked

,
and
ungraciously
bark
at
us
as
we
enter
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
stand
up
,
give
us
each
a
torpid
smile
of
welcome
,
and
look
helplessly
beyond
us
at
Mr
Mulliner
,
as
if
she
hope
he
would
place
us
in
chair
,
for
,
if
he
do
not
,
she
never
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
think
we
could
find
our
way
to
the
circle
round
the
fire
,
which
remind
me
of
Stonehenge
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
come
to
the
rescue
of
our
hostess
,
and
,
somehow
or
other
,
we
find
ourselves
for
the
first
time
place
agreeably
,
and
not
formally
,
in
Mrs
Jamieson
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
,
now
we
have
time
to
look
at
her
,
prove
to
be
a
bright
little
woman
of
middle
age
,
who
have
be
very
pretty
in
the
day
of
her
youth
,
and
who
be
even
yet
very
pleasant
-
looking
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
Miss
Pole
appraise
her
dress
in
the
first
five
minute
,
and
I
take
her
word
when
she
say
the
next
day
     
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
<EOS>
ten
pound
would
have
purchase
every
stitch
she
have
on
 
lace
and
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
suspect
that
a
peeress
could
be
poor
,
and
partly
reconcile
us
to
the
fact
that
her
husband
have
never
sit
in
the
House
of
Lords
;
which
,
when
we
first
hear
of
it
,
seem
a
kind
of
swindle
us
out
of
our
prospect
on
false
pretence
;
a
sort
of
"
a
Lord
and
no
Lord
"
business
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
all
very
silent
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
think
what
we
could
talk
about
,
that
should
be
high
enough
to
interest
My
Lady
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
rise
in
the
price
of
sugar
,
which
,
as
preserving
-
time
be
near
,
be
a
piece
of
intelligence
to
all
our
house
-
keep
heart
,
and
would
have
be
the
natural
topic
if
Lady
Glenmire
have
not
be
by
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
be
not
sure
if
the
peerage
eat
preserve
 
much
less
know
how
they
be
make
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
Miss
Pole
,
who
have
always
a
great
deal
of
courage
and
savoir
faire
,
speak
to
Lady
Glenmire
,
who
on
her
part
have
seem
just
as
much
puzzle
to
know
how
to
break
the
silence
as
we
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
your
ladyship
be
to
Court
lately
?
"
<EOS>
ask
she
;
and
then
give
a
little
glance
round
at
us
,
half
timid
and
half
triumphant
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
<EOS>
see
how
judiciously
I
have
choose
a
subject
befit
the
rank
of
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
be
there
in
my
life
,
"
say
Lady
Glenmire
,
with
a
broad
Scotch
accent
,
but
in
a
very
sweet
voice
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
if
she
have
be
too
abrupt
,
she
add
:
 
<EOS>
"
We
very
seldom
go
to
London
 
only
twice
,
in
fact
,
during
all
my
married
life
;
and
before
I
be
marry
my
father
have
far
too
large
a
family
"
(
fifth
daughter
of
Mr
Campbell
be
in
all
our
mind
,
I
be
sure
)
"
to
take
us
often
from
our
home
,
even
to
Edinburgh
.
 
<EOS>
Ye'll
have
be
in
Edinburgh
,
maybe
?
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
suddenly
brighten
up
with
the
hope
of
a
common
interest
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
none
of
us
be
there
;
but
Miss
Pole
have
an
uncle
who
once
have
pass
a
night
there
,
which
be
very
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
,
meanwhile
,
be
absorb
in
wonder
why
Mr
Mulliner
do
not
bring
the
tea
;
and
at
length
the
wonder
ooze
out
of
her
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
better
re
the
bell
,
my
dear
,
have
not
I
?
"
say
Lady
Glenmire
briskly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
I
think
not
 
Mulliner
do
not
like
to
be
hurry
.
<EOS>
"
  
We
should
have
like
our
tea
,
for
we
dine
at
an
early
hour
than
Mrs
Jamieson
.
 
<EOS>
I
suspect
Mr
Mulliner
have
to
finish
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
before
he
choose
to
trouble
himself
about
tea
.
 
<EOS>
His
mistress
fidget
and
fidget
,
and
keep
say
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
think
why
Mulliner
do
not
bring
tea
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
what
he
can
be
about
.
"
<EOS>
and
Lady
Glenmire
at
last
grow
quite
impatient
,
but
it
be
a
pretty
kind
of
impatience
after
all
;
and
she
ring
the
bell
rather
sharply
,
on
receive
a
half
-
permission
from
her
sister
-
in
-
law
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mulliner
appear
in
dignified
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Mrs
Jamieson
,
"
Lady
Glenmire
ring
the
bell
<EOS>
;
I
believe
it
be
for
tea
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
tea
be
bring
.
 
<EOS>
very
delicate
be
the
china
,
very
old
<EOS>
the
plate
,
very
thin
the
bread
and
butter
,
and
very
small
the
lump
of
sugar
.
 
<EOS>
Sugar
be
evidently
Mrs
Jamieson
's
favourite
economy
.
 
<EOS>
I
question
if
the
little
filigree
sugar
-
tong
,
make
something
like
scissor
,
could
have
open
themselves
wide
enough
to
take
up
an
honest
,
vulgar
good
-
sized
piece
;
and
when
I
try
to
seize
two
little
minnikin
piece
at
once
,
so
as
not
to
be
detect
in
too
many
return
to
the
sugar
-
basin
,
they
absolutely
drop
one
,
with
a
little
sharp
clatter
,
quite
in
a
malicious
and
unnatural
manner
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
this
happen
we
have
have
a
slight
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
little
silver
jug
be
cream
,
in
the
large
one
be
milk
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Mr
Mulliner
come
in
,
Carlo
begin
to
beg
,
which
be
a
thing
our
manner
forebade
us
to
do
,
though
I
be
sure
we
be
just
as
hungry
;
and
Mrs
Jamieson
say
she
be
certain
we
would
excuse
her
if
she
give
her
poor
dumb
Carlo
his
tea
first
.
<EOS>
She
accordingly
mix
a
saucerful
for
him
,
and
put
it
down
for
him
to
lap
;
and
then
she
tell
us
how
intelligent
and
sensible
the
dear
little
fellow
be
;
he
know
cream
quite
well
,
and
constantly
refuse
tea
with
only
milk
in
it
:
 
<EOS>
so
the
milk
be
leave
for
us
;
but
we
silently
think
we
be
quite
as
intelligent
and
sensible
as
Carlo
,
and
feel
as
if
insult
be
add
to
injury
when
we
be
call
upon
to
admire
the
gratitude
evince
by
his
wag
his
tail
for
the
cream
which
should
have
be
ours
.
  
<EOS>
after
tea
we
thaw
down
into
common
-
life
subject
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
thankful
to
Lady
Glenmire
for
have
propose
some
more
bread
and
butter
,
and
this
mutual
want
make
us
better
acquaint
with
her
than
we
should
ever
have
be
with
talk
about
the
Court
,
though
Miss
Pole
do
say
she
have
hope
to
know
how
the
dear
Queen
be
from
some
one
who
have
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
friendship
begin
over
bread
and
butter
extend
on
to
card
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
play
Preference
to
admiration
,
and
be
a
complete
authority
as
to
Ombre
and
Quadrille
.
 
<EOS>
even
Miss
Pole
quite
forget
to
say
"
my
lady
,
"
and
"
your
ladyship
,
"
and
say
"
Basto
!
<EOS>
madam
"
;
"
you
have
Spadille
,
I
believe
,
"
just
as
quietly
as
if
we
have
never
hold
the
great
Cranford
Parliament
on
the
subject
of
the
proper
mode
of
address
a
peeress
.
  
<EOS>
as
a
proof
of
how
thoroughly
we
have
forget
that
we
be
in
the
presence
of
one
who
may
have
sit
down
to
tea
with
a
coronet
,
instead
of
a
cap
,
on
her
head
,
Mrs
Forrester
relate
a
curious
little
fact
to
Lady
Glenmire
 
<EOS>
an
anecdote
know
to
the
circle
of
her
intimate
friend
,
but
of
which
even
Mrs
Jamieson
be
not
aware
.
<EOS>
It
relate
to
some
fine
old
lace
,
the
sole
relic
of
well
day
,
which
Lady
Glenmire
be
admire
on
Mrs
Forrester
's
collar
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
that
lady
,
"
such
lace
can
not
be
get
now
for
either
love
or
money
;
make
by
the
nun
abroad
,
they
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
that
they
can
not
make
it
now
even
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
they
can
,
now
they
have
pass
the
Catholic
Emancipation
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
meantime
,
I
treasure
up
my
lace
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
even
trust
the
washing
of
it
to
my
maid
"
(
the
little
charity
school
-
girl
I
have
name
before
,
but
who
sound
well
as
"
my
maid
"
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
wash
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
and
once
it
have
a
narrow
escape
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
your
ladyship
know
that
such
lace
must
never
be
starch
or
iron
.
 
<EOS>
some
people
wash
it
in
sugar
and
water
,
and
some
in
coffee
,
to
make
it
the
right
yellow
colour
;
but
I
myself
have
a
very
good
receipt
for
wash
it
in
milk
,
which
stiffen
it
enough
,
and
give
it
a
very
good
creamy
colour
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
madam
,
I
have
tack
it
together
(
and
<EOS>
the
beauty
of
this
fine
lace
be
that
,
when
it
be
wet
,
it
go
into
a
very
little
space
)
,
and
put
it
to
soak
in
milk
,
when
,
unfortunately
,
I
leave
the
room
;
on
my
return
,
I
find
pussy
on
the
table
,
look
very
like
a
thief
,
but
gulp
very
uncomfortably
,
as
if
she
be
half
-
chock
with
something
she
want
to
swallow
and
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
would
you
believe
it
?
 
<EOS>
at
first
I
pity
her
,
and
say
"
poor
pussy
!
<EOS>
poor
pussy
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
till
,
all
at
once
,
I
look
and
see
the
cup
of
milk
<EOS>
empty
 
<EOS>
clean
out
!
 
<EOS>
"
You
naughty
cat
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
and
I
believe
I
be
provoke
enough
to
give
her
a
slap
,
which
do
no
good
,
but
only
help
the
lace
down
 
just
as
one
slap
a
choke
child
on
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
cry
,
I
be
so
vexed
;
but
I
determine
I
would
not
give
the
lace
up
without
a
struggle
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
lace
may
disagree
with
her
,
at
any
rate
;
but
it
would
have
be
too
much
for
Job
,
if
he
have
see
,
as
I
do
,
that
cat
come
in
,
quite
placid
and
purr
,
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
,
and
almost
expect
to
be
stroke
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
pussy
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
"
if
you
have
any
conscience
you
ought
not
to
expect
that
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
a
thought
strike
me
;
and
I
ring
the
bell
for
my
maid
,
and
send
her
to
Mr
Hoggins
,
with
my
compliment
,
and
would
he
be
kind
enough
to
lend
me
one
of
his
top
-
boot
for
an
hour
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
there
be
anything
odd
in
the
message
;
but
Jenny
say
the
young
man
in
the
surgery
laugh
as
if
they
would
be
ill
at
my
want
a
top
-
boot
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
come
,
Jenny
and
I
put
pussy
in
,
with
her
forefeet
straight
down
,
so
that
they
be
fasten
,
and
could
not
scratch
,
and
we
give
her
a
teaspoonful
of
current
-
jelly
in
which
(
your
ladyship
must
excuse
me
)
<EOS>
I
have
mix
some
tartar
emetic
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
how
anxious
I
be
for
the
next
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
I
take
pussy
to
my
own
room
,
and
spread
a
clean
towel
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
kiss
her
when
she
return
the
lace
to
sight
,
very
much
as
it
have
go
down
.
 
<EOS>
Jenny
have
boil
water
ready
,
and
we
soak
it
and
soak
it
,
and
spread
it
on
a
lavender
-
bush
in
the
sun
before
I
could
touch
it
again
,
even
to
put
it
in
milk
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
your
ladyship
would
never
guess
that
it
have
be
in
pussy
's
inside
.

<EOS>
We
find
out
,
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
that
Lady
Glenmire
be
go
to
pay
Mrs
Jamieson
a
long
visit
,
as
she
have
give
up
her
apartment
in
Edinburgh
,
and
have
no
tie
to
take
her
back
there
in
a
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
we
be
rather
glad
to
hear
this
,
for
she
have
make
a
pleasant
impression
upon
us
;
and
it
be
also
very
comfortable
to
find
,
from
thing
which
drop
out
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
that
,
in
addition
to
many
other
genteel
quality
,
she
be
far
remove
from
the
"
vulgarity
of
wealth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
find
it
very
unpleasant
walk
?
"
ask
Mrs
Jamieson
,
as
our
respective
servant
be
announce
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
pretty
regular
question
from
Mrs
Jamieson
,
who
have
her
own
carriage
in
the
coach
-
house
,
and
always
go
out
in
a
sedan
-
chair
to
the
very
short
distance
.
 
<EOS>
the
answer
be
nearly
as
much
a
matter
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
no
!
<EOS>
it
be
so
pleasant
and
still
at
night
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
such
a
refreshment
after
the
excitement
of
a
party
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
star
be
so
beautiful
!
"
 
<EOS>
this
last
be
from
Miss
Matty
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
fond
of
astronomy
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
very
,
"
reply
Miss
Matty
,
rather
confuse
at
the
moment
to
remember
which
be
astronomy
and
which
be
astrology
 
<EOS>
but
the
answer
be
true
under
either
circumstance
,
for

tell
me
she

that
she
would
not

so
tired

dizzy

<EOS>
in
our
patten

pick
our
way
home
with

so
refined

<EOS>
signor
BRUNONI
 
<EOS>
soon
after
the
event
of
which
I
give
an
account
in
my
last
paper
,
I
be
summon
home
by
my
father
's
illness
;
and
for
a
time
I
forget
,
in
anxiety
about
him
,
to
wonder
how
my
dear
friend
at
Cranford
be
get
on
,
or
how
Lady
Glenmire
could
reconcile
herself
to
the
dulness
of
the
long
visit
which
she
be
still
pay
to
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
Mrs
Jamieson
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
father
grow
a
little
strong
I
accompany
him
to
the
seaside
,
so
that
altogether
I
seem
banish
from
Cranford
,
and
be
deprive
of
the
opportunity
of
hear
any
chance
intelligence
of
the
dear
little
town
for
the
great
part
of
that
year
.
  
<EOS>
late
in
November
 
when
we
have
return
home
again
,
and
my
father
be
once
more
in
good
health
 
<EOS>
I
receive
a
letter
from
Miss
Matty
;
and
a
very
mysterious
letter
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
begin
many
sentence
without
end
them
,
run
them
one
into
another
,
in
much
the
same
confused
sort
of
way
in
which
write
word
run
together
on
blotting
-
paper
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
could
make
out
be
that
,
if
my
father
be
well
(
which
she
hope
he
be
)
,
and
would
take
warning
and
wear
a
great
-
coat
from
Michaelmas
to
Lady
-
day
,
if
turban
be
in
fashion
,
could
I
tell
her
?
 
<EOS>
such
a
piece
of
gaiety
be
go
to
happen
as
have
not
be
see
or
know
of
since
Wombwell
's
lion
come
,
when
one
of
them
eat
a
little
child
's
arm
;
and
she
be
,
perhaps
,
too
old
to
care
about
dress
,
but
a
new
cap
she
must
have
;
and
,
have
hear
that
turban
be
wear
,
and
some
of
the
county
family
likely
to
come
,
she
would
like
to
look
tidy
,
if
I
would
bring
her
a
cap
from
the
milliner
I
employ
;
<EOS>
and
oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
how
careless
of
her
to
forget
that
she
write
to
beg
I
would
come
and
pay
her
a
visit
next
Tuesday
;
when
she
hope
to
have
something
to
offer
me
in
the
way
of
amusement
,
which
she
would
not
now
more
particularly
describe
,
only
sea
-
green
be
her
favourite
colour
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
end
her
letter
;
but
in
a
P.S.
she
add
<EOS>
,
she
think
she
may
as
well
tell
me
what
be
the
peculiar
attraction
to
Cranford
just
now
;
Signor
Brunoni
be
go
to
exhibit
his
wonderful
magic
in
the
Cranford
Assembly
Rooms
on
Wednesday
and
Friday
evening
in
the
follow
week
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
to
accept
the
invitation
from
my
dear
Miss
Matty
,
independently
of
the
conjuror
,
and
most
particularly
anxious
to
prevent
her
from
disfigure
her
small
,
gentle
,
mousey
face
with
a
great
Saracen
's
head
turban
;
and
accordingly
,
I
buy
her
a
pretty
,
neat
,
middle
-
aged
cap
,
which
,
however
,
be
rather
a
disappointment
to
her
when
,
on
my
arrival
,
she
follow
me
into
my
bedroom
,
ostensibly
to
poke
the
fire
,
but
in
reality
,
I
do
believe
,
to
see
if
the
sea
-
green
turban
be
not
inside
the
cap
-
box
with
which
I
have
travel
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
I
twirl
the
cap
round
on
my
hand
to
exhibit
back
and
side
front
:
 
<EOS>
her
heart
have
be
set
upon
a
turban
,
and
all
she
could
do
be
to
say
,
with
resignation
in
her
look
and
voice
     
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
do
your
good
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
just
like
the
cap
all
the
lady
in
Cranford
be
wear
,
and
they
have
have
theirs
for
a
year
,
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
like
something
new
<EOS>
,
I
confess
 
something
more
like
the
turban
<EOS>
Miss
Betty
Barker
tell
me
Queen
Adelaide
wear
;
but
it
be
very
pretty
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
dare
say
lavender
will
wear
better
than
sea
-
green
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
after
all
,
what
be
dress
,
that
we
should
care
anything
about
it
?
 
<EOS>
You
will
tell
me
if
you
want
anything
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
turban
have
not
get
down
to
Drumble
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
,
the
dear
old
lady
gently
bemoan
herself
out
of
the
room
,
leave
me
to
dress
for
the
evening
,
when
,
as
she
inform
me
,
she
expect
Miss
Pole
and
Mrs
Forrester
,
and
she
hope
I
should
not
feel
myself
too
much
tired
to
join
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
should
not
;
and
I
make
some
haste
to
unpack
and
arrange
my
dress
;
but
,
with
all
my
speed
,
I
hear
the
arrival
and
the
buzz
of
conversation
in
the
next
room
before
I
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
I
open
the
door
,
I
catch
the
word
,
"
I
be
foolish
to
expect
anything
very
genteel
out
of
the
drumble
shop
;
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
she
do
her
good
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
,
for
all
that
,
I
have
rather
that
she
blame
drumble
and
me
than
disfigure
herself
with
a
turban
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
be
always
the
person
,
in
the
trio
of
Cranford
lady
now
assemble
,
to
have
have
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
in
the
habit
of
spend
the
morning
in
rambling
from
shop
to
shop
,
not
to
purchase
anything
(
except
an
occasional
reel
of
cotton
or
a
piece
of
tape
)
,
but
to
see
the
new
article
and
report
upon
them
,
and
to
collect
all
the
stray
piece
of
intelligence
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
way
,
too
,
of
demurely
pop
hither
and
thither
into
all
sort
of
place
to
gratify
her
curiosity
on
any
point
 
a
way
which
,
if
she
have
not
look
so
very
genteel
and
prim
,
may
have
be
consider
impertinent
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
by
the
expressive
way
in
which
she
clear
her
throat
,
and
wait
for
all
minor
subject
(
such
as
cap
and
turban
)
to
be
clear
off
the
course
,
we
know
she
have
something
very
particular
to
relate
,
when
the
due
pause
come
 
<EOS>
and
I
defy
any
people
possess
of
common
modesty
to
keep
up
a
conversation
long
,
where
one
among
them
sit
up
aloft
in
silence
,
look
down
upon
all
the
thing
they
chance
to
say
as
trivial
and
contemptible
compare
to
what
they
could
disclose
,
if
properly
entreat
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
begin
     
"
as
I
be
step
out
of
Gordon
's
shop
to
-
day
,
I
chance
to
go
into
the
"
George
"
(
my
Betty
have
a
second
-
cousin
who
be
chambermaid
there
,
and
I
think
Betty
would
like
to
hear
how
she
be
)
,
and
,
not
see
anyone
about
,
I
stroll
up
the
staircase
,
and
find
myself
in
the
passage
lead
to
the
Assembly
Room
(
you
and
I
remember
the
Assembly
Room
,
I
be
sure
,
Miss
Matty
!
<EOS>
and
the
minuets
de
la
cour
!
)
<EOS>
;
so
I
go
on
,
not
think
of
what
I
be
about
,
when
,
all
at
once
,
I
perceive
that
I
be
in
the
middle
of
the
preparation
for
to
-
morrow
night
 
<EOS>
the
room
be
divide
with
great
clothe
-
maid
,
over
which
Crosby
's
man
be
tack
red
flannel
;
very
dark
and
odd
<EOS>
it
seem
;
it
quite
bewilder
me
,
and
I
be
go
on
behind
the
screen
,
in
my
absence
of
mind
,
when
a
gentleman
(
quite
the
gentleman
,
I
can
assure
you
)
step
forwards
and
ask
if
I
have
any
business
he
could
arrange
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
such
pretty
broken
English
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
help
think
of
Thaddeus
of
Warsaw
,
and
the
Hungarian
Brothers
,
and
Santo
Sebastiani
;
and
while
I
be
busy
picture
his
past
life
to
myself
,
he
have
bow
me
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
but
wait
a
minute
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
hear
half
my
story
yet
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
downstairs
,
when
who
should
I
meet
<EOS>
but
Betty
's
second
-
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
of
course
,
I
stop
to
speak
to
her
for
Betty
's
sake
;
and
she
tell
me
that
I
have
really
see
the
conjuror
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
who
speak
broken
English
be
Signor
Brunoni
himself
.
 
<EOS>
just
at
this
moment
he
pass
us
on
the
stair
,
make
such
a
graceful
bow
!
<EOS>
in
reply
to
which
I
drop
a
curtsey
 
<EOS>
all
foreigner
have
such
polite
manner
,
one
catch
something
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
go
downstairs
,
I
bethink
me
that
I
have
drop
my
glove
in
the
Assembly
Room
(
it
be
safe
in
my
muff
all
the
time
,
but
I
never
find
it
till
afterwards
)
;
so
I
go
back
,
and
,
just
as
I
be
creep
up
the
passage
leave
on
one
side
of
the
great
screen
that
go
nearly
across
the
room
,
who
should
I
see
but
<EOS>
the
very
same
gentleman
that
have
meet
me
before
,
and
pass
me
on
the
stair
,
come
now
forwards
from
the
inner
part
of
the
room
,
to
which
there
be
no
entrance
 
you
remember
,
Miss
Matty
 
and
just
repeat
,
in
his
pretty
broken
English
,
the
inquiry
if
I
have
any
business
there
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
that
he
put
it
quite
so
bluntly
,
but
he
seem
very
determined
that
I
should
not
pass
the
screen
 
<EOS>
so
,
of
course
,
I
explain
about
my
glove
,
which
,
curiously
enough
,
I
find
at
that
very
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
,
then
,
have
see
the
conjuror
 
<EOS>
the
real
,
live
conjuror
!
<EOS>
and
numerous
be
the
question
we
all
ask
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
he
a
beard
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
he
young
,
or
old
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
fair
,
or
dark
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
he
look
"
  
(
unable
to
shape
my
question
prudently
,
I
put
it
in
another
form
)
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
he
look
?
"
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
Miss
Pole
be
the
heroine
of
the
evening
,
owe
to
her
morning
's
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
be
not
the
rose
(
that
be
to
say
the
conjuror
)
<EOS>
she
have
be
near
it
.
  
<EOS>
conjuration
,
sleight
of
hand
,
magic
,
witchcraft
,
be
the
subject
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
be
slightly
sceptical
,
and
incline
to
think
there
may
be
a
scientific
solution
find
for
even
the
proceeding
of
the
Witch
of
Endor
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
believe
everything
,
from
ghost
to
death
-
watch
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
range
between
the
two
 
always
convince
by
the
last
speaker
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
be
naturally
more
inclined
to
Mrs
Forrester
's
side
,
but
a
desire
of
prove
herself
a
worthy
sister
to
Miss
Jenkyns
keep
her
equally
balanced
 
Miss
Jenkyns
,
who
would
never
allow
a
servant
to
call
the
little
roll
of
tallow
that
form
themselves
round
candle
"
winding
-
sheet
,
"
but
insist
on
their
being
speak
of
as
"
roley-
poley
!
"
 
<EOS>
a
sister
of
her
to
be
superstitious
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
never
do
.
  
<EOS>
after
tea
,
I
be
despatch
downstairs
into
the
dining
-
parlour
for
that
volume
of
the
old
Encyclopaedia
which
contain
the
noun
begin
with
C
,
in
order
that
Miss
Pole
may
prime
herself
with
scientific
explanation
for
the
trick
of
the
follow
evening
.
<EOS>
It
spoilt
the
pool
at
Preference
which
Miss
Matty
and
Mrs
Forrester
have
be
look
forward
to
,
for
Miss
Pole
<EOS>
become
so
much
absorb
in
her
subject
,
and
the
plate
by
which
it
be
illustrate
,
that
we
feel
it
would
be
cruel
to
disturb
her
otherwise
than
by
one
or
two
well
-
time
yawn
,
which
I
throw
in
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
for
I
be
really
touch
by
the
meek
way
in
which
the
two
lady
be
bear
their
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
but
Miss
Pole
only
read
the
more
zealously
,
impart
to
us
no
more
information
than
this
     
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
;
I
comprehend
perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
a
represent
the
ball
.
 
<EOS>
put
A
between
b
and
d
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
between
C
and
F
,
and
turn
the
second
joint
of
the
third
finger
of
your
left
hand
over
the
wrist
of
your
right
H.
very
clear
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Mrs
Forrester
,
conjuring
and
witchcraft
be
a
mere
affair
of
the
alphabet
.
 
<EOS>
do
let
me
read
you
this
one
passage
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
implore
Miss
Pole
to
spare
her
,
say
,
from
a
child
upwards
<EOS>
,
she
never
could
understand
be
read
aloud
to
;
and
I
drop
the
pack
of
card
,
which
I
have
be
shuffle
very
audibly
,
and
by
this
discreet
movement
I
oblige
Miss
Pole
to
perceive
that
Preference
be
to
have
be
the
order
of
the
evening
,
and
to
propose
,
rather
unwillingly
,
that
the
pool
should
commence
.
 
<EOS>
the
pleasant
brightness
that
steal
over
the
other
two
lady
'
face
on
this
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
have
one
or
two
twinge
of
self
-
reproach
for
have
interrupt
Miss
Pole
in
her
study
:
 
and
do
not
remember
her
card
well
,
or
give
her
full
attention
to
the
game
,
until
she
have
soothe
her
conscience
by
offer
to
lend
the
volume
of
the
Encyclopaedia
to
Miss
Pole
,
who
accept
it
thankfully
,
and
say
Betty
should
take
it
home
when
she
come
with
the
lantern
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
evening
we
be
all
in
a
little
gentle
flutter
at
the
idea
of
the
gaiety
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
go
up
to
dress
betime
,
and
hurry
me
until
I
be
ready
,
when
we
find
we
have
an
hour
-
and
-
a-
half
to
wait
before
the
"
door
open
at
seven
precisely
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
we
have
only
twenty
yard
to
go
!
 
<EOS>
however
,
as
Miss
Matty
say
,
it
would
not
do
to
get
too
much
absorb
in
anything
,
and
forget
the
time
;
so
she
think
we
have
better
sit
quietly
,
without
light
the
candle
,
till
five
minute
to
seven
.
 
<EOS>
so
Miss
Matty
doze
,
and
I
knit
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
we
set
off
;
and
at
the
door
under
the
carriage
-
way
at
the
"
George
,
"
we
meet
Mrs
Forrester
and
Miss
Pole
:
 
<EOS>
the
latter
be
discuss
the
subject
of
the
evening
with
more
vehemence
than
ever
,
and
throw
X
's
and
B
's
at
our
head
like
hailstone
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
even
copy
one
or
two
of
the
"
receipt
"
 
<EOS>
a
s
<EOS>
she
call
them
 
for
the
different
trick
,
on
back
of
letter
,
ready
to
explain
and
to
detect
Signor
Brunoni
's
art
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
into
the
cloak
-
room
adjoin
the
Assembly
Room
;
Miss
Matty
give
a
sigh
or
two
to
her
depart
youth
,
and
the
remembrance
of
the
last
time
she
have
be
there
,
as
she
adjust
her
pretty
new
cap
before
the
strange
,
quaint
old
mirror
in
the
cloak
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
the
Assembly
Room
have
be
add
to
the
inn
,
about
a
hundred
year
before
,
by
the
different
county
family
,
who
meet
together
there
once
a
month
during
the
winter
to
dance
and
play
at
card
.
 
<EOS>
many
a
county
beauty
have
first
swing
through
the
minuet
that
she
afterwards
dance
before
Queen
Charlotte
in
this
very
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
one
of
the
gunning
have
grace
the
apartment
with
her
beauty
;
it
be
certain
that
a
rich
and
beautiful
widow
,
Lady
Williams
,
have
here
be
smite
with
the
noble
figure
of
a
young
artist
,
who
be
stay
with
some
family
in
the
neighbourhood
for
professional
purpose
,
and
accompany
his
patron
to
the
Cranford
Assembly
.
 
<EOS>
and
a
pretty
bargain
poor
Lady
Williams
have
of
her
handsome
husband
,
if
all
tale
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
no
beauty
blush
and
dimple
along
the
side
of
the
Cranford
Assembly
Room
;
no
handsome
artist
win
heart
by
his
bow
,
chapeau
bra
in
hand
;
the
old
room
be
dingy
;
the
salmon
-
colour
paint
have
fade
into
a
drab
;
great
piece
of
plaster
have
chip
off
from
the
fine
wreath
and
festoon
on
its
wall
;
but
still
a
mouldy
odour
of
aristocracy
linger
about
the
place
,
and
a
dusty
recollection
of
the
day
that
be
go
make
Miss
Matty
and
Mrs
Forrester
bridle
up
as
they
enter
,
and
walk
mincingly
up
the
room
,
as
if
there
be
a
number
of
genteel
observer
,
instead
of
two
little
boy
with
a
stick
of
toffee
between
them
with
which
to
beguile
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
We
stop
short
at
the
second
front
row
;
I
could
hardly
understand
why
,
until
I
hear
Miss
Pole
ask
a
stray
waiter
if
any
of
the
county
family
be
expect
;
and
when
he
shake
his
head
,
and
believe
not
,
Mrs
Forrester
and
Miss
Matty
move
forwards
,
and
our
party
represent
a
conversational
square
.
 
<EOS>
the
front
row
be
soon
augment
and
enrich
by
Lady
Glenmire
and
Mrs
Jamieson
.
 
<EOS>
We
six
occupy
the
two
front
row
,
and
our
aristocratic
seclusion
be
respect
by
the
group
of
shop
-
keeper
who
stray
in
from
time
to
time
and
huddle
together
on
the
back
bench
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
I
conjecture
so
,
from
the
noise
they
make
,
and
the
sonorous
bump
they
give
in
sit
down
;
but
when
,
in
weariness
of
the
obstinate
green
curtain
that
would
not
draw
up
,
but
would
stare
at
me
with
two
odd
eye
,
see
through
hole
,
as
in
the
old
tapestry
story
,
I
would
fain
have
look
round
at
the
merry
<EOS>
chatter
people
behind
me
<EOS>
,
Miss
Pole
clutch
my
arm
,
and
beg
me
not
to
turn
,
for
"
it
be
not
the
thing
.
"
 
<EOS>
what
"
the
thing
"
be
,
I
never
could
find
out
,
but
it
must
have
be
something
eminently
dull
and
tiresome
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
all
sit
eye
<EOS>
right
,
square
front
,
gaze
at
the
tantalising
curtain
,
and
hardly
speak
intelligibly
,
we
be
so
afraid
of
be
catch
in
the
vulgarity
of
make
any
noise
in
a
place
of
public
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
be
the
most
fortunate
,
for
she
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
the
eye
disappear
 
the
curtain
quiver
 
<EOS>
one
side
go
up
before
the
other
,
which
stick
fast
;
it
be
drop
again
,
and
,
with
a
fresh
effort
,
and
a
vigorous
pull
from
some
unseen
hand
,
it
fly
up
,
reveal
to
our
sight
a
magnificent
gentleman
in
the
turkish
costume
,
seat
before
a
little
table
,
gaze
at
us
<EOS>
(
I
should
have
say
with
the
same
eye
that
I
have
last
see
through
the
hole
in
the
curtain
)
with
calm
and
condescend
dignity
,
"
like
a
being
of
another
sphere
,
"
as
I
hear
a
sentimental
voice
ejaculate
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
Signor
Brunoni
!
"
say
Miss
Pole
decidedly
;
and
so
audibly
that
I
be
sure
he
hear
,
for
he
glance
down
over
his
flow
beard
at
our
party
with
an
air
of
mute
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
"
Signor
Brunoni
have
no
beard
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
he
will
come
soon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
she
lull
herself
into
patience
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Miss
Matty
have
reconnoitre
through
her
eye
-
glass
,
wipe
it
,
and
look
again
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
turn
round
,
and
say
to
me
,
in
a
kind
,
mild
,
sorrowful
tone
     
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
,
turbans
are
wear
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
we
have
no
time
for
more
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
the
Grand
Turk
,
as
Miss
Pole
choose
to
call
him
,
arise
and
announce
himself
as
Signor
Brunoni
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
him
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Miss
Pole
,
in
a
defiant
manner
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
her
again
,
with
the
same
dignified
upbraiding
in
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeat
more
positively
than
ever
.
"
<EOS>
Signor
Brunoni
have
not
get
that
muffy
sort
of
thing
about
his
chin
,
but
look
like
a
close
-
shave
christian
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
's
energetic
speech
have
the
good
effect
of
waken
up
Mrs
Jamieson
,
who
open
her
eye
wide
,
in
sign
of
the
deep
attention
 
a
proceeding
which
silence
Miss
Pole
and
encourage
the
Grand
Turk
to
proceed
,
which
he
do
in
very
break
English
 
<EOS>
so
broken
that
there
be
no
cohesion
between
the
part
of
his
sentence
;
a
fact
which
he
himself
perceive
at
last
,
and
so
leave
off
speak
and
proceed
to
action
.
  
<EOS>
now
we
be
astonished
.
 
<EOS>
how
he
do
his
trick
I
could
not
imagine
;
no
,
not
even
when
Miss
Pole
pull
out
her
piece
of
paper
and
begin
read
aloud
 
or
at
least
in
a
very
audible
whisper
 
<EOS>
the
separate
"
receipt
"
for
the
most
common
of
his
trick
.
 
<EOS>
if
ever
I
see
a
man
frown
and
look
enrage
,
I
see
the
Grand
Turk
frown
at
Miss
Pole
;
but
,
as
she
say
,
what
could
be
expect
but
unchristian
look
from
a
Mussulman
?
 
<EOS>
if
Miss
Pole
be
sceptical
,
and
more
engrossed
with
her
receipt
and
diagram
than
with
his
trick
,
Miss
Matty
and
Mrs
Forrester
be
mystify
and
perplex
to
the
high
degree
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
keep
take
her
spectacle
off
and
wipe
them
,
as
if
she
think
it
be
something
defective
in
them
which
make
the
legerdemain
;
and
Lady
Glenmire
,
who
have
see
many
curious
sight
in
Edinburgh
,
be
very
much
strike
with
the
trick
,
and
would
not
at
all
agree
with
Miss
Pole
,
who
declare
that
anybody
could
do
them
with
a
little
practice
,
and
that
she
would
,
herself
,
undertake
to
do
all
he
do
,
with
two
hour
give
to
study
the
Encyclopaedia
and
make
her
third
finger
flexible
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
Miss
Matty
and
Mrs
Forrester
become
perfectly
awestricken
.
<EOS>
They
whisper
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
just
behind
them
,
so
I
could
not
help
hear
what
they
be
say
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
ask
Mrs
Forrester
"
if
she
think
it
be
quite
right
to
have
come
to
see
such
thing
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
fear
they
be
lend
encouragement
to
something
that
be
not
quite
"
  
<EOS>
a
little
shake
of
the
head
fill
up
the
blank
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
reply
,
that
the
same
thought
have
cross
her
mind
;
she
too
be
feel
very
uncomfortable
,
it
be
so
very
strange
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
quite
certain
that
it
be
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
which
be
in
that
loaf
just
now
;
and
it
have
be
in
her
own
hand
not
five
minute
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
wonder
who
have
furnish
the
bread
?
 
<EOS>
She
be
sure
it
could
not
be
Dakin
,
because
he
be
the
churchwarden
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
Miss
Matty
half
-
turn
towards
me
     
<EOS>
"
Will
you
look
,
my
dear
 
you
be
a
stranger
in
the
town
,
and
it
will
not
give
rise
to
unpleasant
report
 
<EOS>
will
you
just
look
round
and
see
if
the
rector
be
here
?
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
,
I
think
we
may
conclude
that
this
wonderful
man
be
sanction
by
the
Church
,
and
that
will
be
a
great
relief
to
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
,
and
I
see
the
tall
,
thin
,
dry
,
dusty
rector
,
sit
surround
by
National
School
boy
,
guard
by
troop
of
his
own
sex
from
any
approach
of
the
many
Cranford
spinster
.
 
<EOS>
His
kind
face
be
all
agape
with
broad
smile
,
and
the
boy
around
him
be
in
chink
of
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
Miss
Matty
that
the
Church
be
smile
approval
,
which
set
her
mind
at
ease
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
never
name
Mr
Hayter
,
the
rector
,
because
I
,
as
a
well
-
to-
do
and
happy
young
woman
,
never
come
in
contact
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
old
bachelor
,
but
as
afraid
of
matrimonial
report
get
abroad
about
him
as
any
girl
of
eighteen
:
 
and
he
would
rush
into
a
shop
or
dive
down
an
entry
,
sooner
than
encounter
any
of
the
Cranford
lady
in
the
street
;
and
,
as
for
the
Preference
party
,
I
do
not
wonder
at
his
not
accept
invitation
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
always
suspect
Miss
Pole
of
have
give
very
vigorous
chase
to
Mr
Hayter
when
he
first
come
to
Cranford
;
and
not
the
less
,
because
now
she
appear
to
share
so
vividly
in
his
dread
lest
her
name
should
ever
be
couple
with
his
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
all
his
interest
among
the
poor
and
helpless
;
he
have
treat
the
National
School
boy
this
very
night
to
the
performance
;
and
virtue
be
for
once
its
own
reward
,
for
they
guard
him
right
and
leave
,
and
clung
round
him
as
if
he
have
be
the
queen
-
bee
<EOS>
and
they
the
swarm
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
so
safe
in
their
environment
that
he
could
even
afford
to
give
our
party
a
bow
as
we
file
out
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
ignore
his
presence
,
and
pretend
to
be
absorb
in
convince
us
that
we
have
be
cheat
,
and
have
not
see
Signor
Brunoni
after
all
.
   
<EOS>
the
PANIC
 
<EOS>
I
think
a
series
of
circumstance
date
from
Signor
Brunoni
's
visit
to
Cranford
,
which
seem
at
the
time
connect
in
our
mind
with
him
,
though
I
do
not
know
that
he
have
anything
really
to
do
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
all
at
once
all
sort
of
uncomfortable
rumour
get
afloat
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
or
two
robbery
 
real
bona
fide
robbery
;
man
have
up
before
the
magistrate
and
commit
for
trial
 
and
that
seem
to
make
us
all
afraid
of
be
rob
;
and
for
a
long
time
,
at
Miss
Matty
's
,
I
know
,
we
use
to
make
a
regular
expedition
<EOS>
all
round
the
kitchen
and
cellar
every
night
,
Miss
Matty
lead
the
way
,
arm
with
the
poker
,
<EOS>
I
follow
with
the
hearth
-
brush
,
and
Martha
carry
the
shovel
and
fire
-
iron
with
which
to
sound
the
alarm
;
and
by
the
accidental
hit
together
of
them
she
often
frighten
us
so
much
that
we
bolt
ourselves
up
,
all
three
together
,
in
the
back
-
kitchen
,
or
store
-
room
,
or
wherever
we
happen
to
be
,
till
,
when
our
affright
be
over
,
we
recollect
ourselves
and
set
out
afresh
with
double
valiance
.
 
<EOS>
by
day
we
hear
strange
story
from
the
shopkeeper
and
cottager
,
of
cart
that
go
about
in
the
dead
of
night
,
draw
by
horse
shod
with
felt
,
and
guard
by
man
in
dark
clothe
,
go
round
the
town
,
no
doubt
in
search
of
some
unwatched
house
or
some
unfastened
door
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
,
who
affect
great
bravery
herself
,
be
the
principal
person
to
collect
and
arrange
these
report
so
as
to
make
them
assume
their
most
fearful
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
discover
that
she
have
beg
one
of
Mr
Hoggins
's
wear
-
out
hat
to
hang
up
in
her
lobby
,
and
we
(
at
least
I
)
have
doubt
as
to
whether
she
really
would
enjoy
the
little
adventure
of
have
her
house
break
into
,
as
she
protest
she
should
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
make
no
secret
of
be
an
arrant
coward
,
but
she
go
regularly
through
her
housekeeper
's
duty
of
inspection
 
only
the
hour
for
this
become
earlier
and
earlier
,
till
at
last
we
go
the
round
at
half
-
past
six
,
and
Miss
Matty
adjourn
to
bed
soon
after
seven
,
"
in
order
to
get
the
night
over
the
sooner
.
"
  
<EOS>
Cranford
have
so
long
pique
itself
on
be
an
honest
and
moral
town
that
it
have
grow
to
fancy
itself
too
genteel
and
well
-
breed
to
be
otherwise
,
and
feel
the
stain
upon
its
character
at
this
time
doubly
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
comfort
ourselves
with
the
assurance
which
we
give
to
each
other
that
the
robbery
could
never
have
be
commit
by
any
Cranford
person
;
it
must
have
be
a
stranger
or
stranger
who
bring
this
disgrace
upon
the
town
,
and
occasion
as
many
precaution
as
if
we
be
live
among
the
Red
Indians
or
the
French
.
  
<EOS>
this
last
comparison
of
our
nightly
state
of
defence
and
fortification
be
make
by
Mrs
Forrester
,
whose
father
have
serve
under
General
Burgoyne
in
the
american
war
,
and
whose
husband
have
fight
the
French
in
Spain
.
 
<EOS>
She
indeed
incline
to
the
idea
that
,
in
some
way
,
the
French
be
connect
with
the
small
theft
,
which
be
ascertain
fact
,
and
the
burglary
and
highway
robbery
,
which
be
rumours
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
deeply
impressed
with
the
idea
of
french
spy
at
some
time
in
her
life
;
and
the
notion
could
never
be
fairly
eradicate
,
but
spring
up
again
from
time
to
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
her
theory
be
this
:
  
<EOS>
the
Cranford
people
respect
themselves
too
much
,
and
be
too
grateful
to
the
aristocracy
who
be
so
kind
as
to
live
near
the
town
,
ever
to
disgrace
their
bringing
up
by
be
dishonest
or
immoral
;
therefore
,
we
must
believe
that
the
robber
be
stranger
 
if
stranger
,
why
not
foreigner
?
 
<EOS>
if
foreigner
,
who
so
likely
as
the
French
?
 
<EOS>
Signor
Brunoni
speak
broken
English
like
a
Frenchman
;
and
,
though
he
wear
a
turban
like
a
Turk
,
Mrs
Forrester
have
see
a
print
of
Madame
de
Stael
with
a
turban
on
,
and
another
of
Mr
Denon
in
just
such
a
dress
as
that
in
which
the
conjuror
have
make
his
appearance
,
show
clearly
that
the
French
,
as
well
as
the
Turks
,
wear
turban
.
 
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
doubt
<EOS>
Signor
Brunoni
be
a
Frenchman
 
<EOS>
a
french
spy
come
to
discover
the
weak
and
undefended
place
of
England
,
and
doubtless
he
have
his
accomplice
.
 
<EOS>
for
her
part
,
she
,
Mrs
Forrester
,
have
always
have
her
own
opinion
of
Miss
Pole
's
adventure
at
the
"
George
Inn
"
 
s
eee
two
man
where
only
one
be
believe
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
french
people
have
way
and
mean
<EOS>
which
,
she
be
thankful
to
say
,
the
English
know
nothing
about
;
and
she
have
never
feel
quite
easy
in
her
mind
about
go
to
see
that
conjuror
 
<EOS>
it
be
rather
too
much
like
a
forbid
thing
,
though
the
rector
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
Mrs
Forrester
grow
more
excited
than
we
have
ever
know
her
before
,
and
,
be
an
officer
's
daughter
and
widow
,
we
look
up
to
her
opinion
,
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
really
I
do
not
know
how
much
be
true
or
false
in
the
report
which
fly
about
like
wildfire
just
at
this
time
;
but
it
seem
to
me
then
that
there
be
every
reason
to
believe
that
at
Mardon
(
a
small
town
about
eight
mile
from
Cranford
)
<EOS>
house
and
shop
be
enter
by
hole
make
in
the
wall
,
the
brick
be
silently
carry
away
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
and
all
do
so
quietly
that
no
sound
be
hear
either
in
or
out
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
give
it
up
in
despair
when
she
hear
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
use
,
"
say
she
,
"
of
lock
and
bolt
,
and
bell
to
the
window
,
and
go
round
the
house
every
night
?
 
<EOS>
that
last
trick
be
fit
for
a
conjuror
.
<EOS>
now
she
do
believe
that
Signor
Brunoni
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
about
five
o'clock
,
we
be
startle
by
a
hasty
knock
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
bid
me
run
and
tell
Martha
on
no
account
to
open
the
door
till
she
(
Miss
Matty
)
have
reconnoitre
through
the
window
;
and
she
arm
herself
with
a
footstool
to
drop
down
on
the
head
of
the
visitor
,
in
case
he
should
show
a
face
cover
with
black
crape
,
as
he
look
up
in
answer
to
her
inquiry
of
who
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
nobody
but
Miss
Pole
and
Betty
.
 
<EOS>
the
former
come
upstairs
,
carry
a
little
hand
-
basket
,
and
she
be
evidently
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
care
of
that
!
"
say
she
to
me
,
as
I
offer
to
relieve
her
of
her
basket
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
plate
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
there
be
a
plan
to
rob
my
house
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
come
to
throw
myself
on
your
hospitality
,
Miss
Matty

<EOS>
Betty
be
go
to
sleep
with
her
cousin
at
the
"
George
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
can
sit
up
here
all
night
if
you
will
allow
me
;
but
my
house
be
so
far
from
any
neighbour
,
and
I
do
not
believe
we
could
be
hear
if
we
scream
ever
so
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
Miss
Matty
,
"
what
have
alarm
you
so
much
?
 
<EOS>
have
you
see
any
man
lurk
about
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
!
"
answer
Miss
Pole
.
 
<EOS>
"
two
very
bad
-
look
man
have
go
three
time
past
the
house
,
very
slowly
;
and
an
irish
beggar
-
woman
come
not
half
-
an
-
hour
ago
,
and
all
but
force
herself
in
past
Betty
,
say
her
child
be
starve
,
and
she
must
speak
to
the
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
she
say
"
mistress
,
"
though
there
be
a
hat
hang
up
in
the
hall
,
and
it
would
have
be
more
natural
to
have
say
"
master

"
 
<EOS>
but
Betty
shut
the
door
in
her
face
,
and
come
up
to
me
,
and
we
get
the
spoon
together
,
and
sit
in
the
parlour
-
window
watching
till
we
see
Thomas
Jones
go
from
his
work
,
when
we
call
to
him
and
ask
him
to
take
care
of
us
into
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
may
have
triumph
over
Miss
Pole
,
who
have
profess
such
bravery
until
she
be
frightened
;
but
we
be
too
glad
to
perceive
that
she
share
in
the
weakness
of
humanity
to
exult
over
her
;
and
I
give
up
my
room
to
her
very
willingly
,
and
share
Miss
Matty
's
bed
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
we
retire
,
the
two
lady
rummage
up
,
out
of
the
recess
of
their
memory
,
such
horrid
story
of
robbery
and
murder
that
I
quite
quake
in
my
shoe
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
be
evidently
anxious
to
prove
that
such
terrible
event
have
occur
within
her
experience
that
she
be
justified
in
her
sudden
panic
;
and
Miss
Matty
do
not
like
to
be
outdo
,
and
cap
every
story
with
one
yet
more
horrible
,
till
it
remind
me
oddly
enough
,
of
an
old
story
I
have
read
somewhere
,
of
a
nightingale
and
a
musician
,
who
strove
one
against
the
other
which
could
produce
the
most
admirable
music
,
till
poor
Philomel
drop
down
dead
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
story
that
haunt
me
for
a
long
time
afterwards
be
of
a
girl
who
be
leave
in
charge
of
a
great
house
in
Cumberland
on
some
particular
fair
-
day
,
when
the
other
servant
all
go
off
to
the
gaiety
.
 
<EOS>
the
family
be
away
in
London
,
and
a
pedlar
come
by
,
and
ask
to
leave
his
large
and
heavy
pack
in
the
kitchen
,
say
he
would
call
for
it
again
at
night
;
and
the
girl
(
a
gamekeeper
's
daughter
)
,
roam
about
in
search
of
amusement
,
chance
to
hit
upon
a
gun
hang
up
in
the
hall
,
and
take
it
down
to
look
at
the
chasing
;
and
it
go
off
through
the
open
kitchen
door
,
hit
the
pack
,
and
a
slow
dark
thread
of
blood
come
ooze
out
.
<EOS>
(
how
Miss
Pole
enjoy
this
part
of
the
story
,
dwell
on
each
word
as
if
she
love
it
!
)
 
<EOS>
She
rather
hurry
over
the
further
account
of
the
girl
's
bravery
,
and
I
have
but
<EOS>
a
confused
idea
that
,
somehow
,
she
baffle
the
robber
with
italian
iron
,
heated
red
-
hot
,
and
then
restore
to
blackness
by
be
dip
in
grease
.
  
<EOS>
We
part
for
the
night
with
an
awe
-
stricken
wonder
as
to
what
we
should
hear
of
in
the
morning
 
and
,
on
my
part
,
with
a
vehement
desire
for
the
night
to
be
over
and
go
:
 
I
be
so
afraid
lest
the
robber
should
have
see
,
from
some
dark
lurking
-
place
,
that
Miss
Pole
have
carry
off
her
plate
,
and
thus
have
a
double
motive
for
attack
our
house
.
  
<EOS>
but
until
Lady
Glenmire
come
to
call
next
day
we
hear
of
nothing
unusual
.
 
<EOS>
the
kitchen
fire
-
iron
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
against
the
back
door
as
when
Martha
and
I
have
skilfully
pile
them
up
,
like
spillikin
,
ready
to
fall
with
an
awful
clatter
if
only
a
cat
have
touch
the
outside
panel
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
wonder
what
we
should
all
do
if
thus
awaken
and
alarm
,
and
have
propose
to
Miss
Matty
that
we
should
cover
up
our
face
under
the
bedclothe
so
that
there
should
be
no
danger
of
the
robber
think
that
we
could
identify
them
;
but
Miss
Matty
,
who
be
tremble
very
much
,
scout
this
idea
,
and
say
we
owe
it
to
society
to
apprehend
them
,
and
that
she
should
certainly
do
her
good
to
lay
hold
of
them
and
lock
them
up
in
the
garret
till
morning
.
  
<EOS>
when
Lady
Glenmire
come
,
we
almost
feel
jealous
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
's
house
have
really
be
attack
;
at
least
there
be
man
's
footstep
to
be
see
on
the
flower
border
,
underneath
the
kitchen
windows
,
"
where
nae
man
should
be
;
"
and
Carlo
have
bark
all
through
the
night
as
if
stranger
be
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
have
be
awaken
by
Lady
Glenmire
,
and
they
have
ring
the
bell
which
communicate
with
Mr
Mulliner
's
room
in
the
third
storey
,
and
when
his
night
-
cap
head
have
appear
over
the
bannister
,
in
answer
to
the
summon
,
they
have
tell
him
of
their
alarm
,
and
the
reason
for
it
;
whereupon
he
retreat
into
his
bedroom
,
and
lock
the
door
(
for
fear
of
draught
,
as
he
inform
them
in
the
morning
)
,
and
open
the
window
,
and
call
out
valiantly
to
say
,
if
the
suppose
robber
would
come
to
him
he
would
fight
them
;
but
,
as
Lady
Glenmire
observe
,
that
be
but
poor
comfort
,
since
they
would
have
to
pass
by
Mrs
Jamieson
's
room
and
her
own
before
they
could
reach
him
,
and
must
be
of
a
very
pugnacious
disposition
indeed
if
they
neglect
the
opportunity
of
robbery
present
by
the
unguarded
low
storey
,
to
go
up
to
a
garret
,
and
there
force
a
door
in
order
to
get
at
the
champion
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
,
after
wait
and
listen
for
some
time
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
have
propose
to
Mrs
Jamieson
that
they
should
go
to
bed
;
but
that
lady
say
she
should
not
feel
comfortable
unless
she
sit
up
and
watch
;
and
,
accordingly
,
she
pack
herself
warmly
up
on
the
sofa
,
where
she
be
find
by
the
housemaid
,
when
she
come
into
the
room
at
six
o'clock
,
fast
asleep
;
but
Lady
Glenmire
go
to
bed
,
and
keep
awake
all
night
.
  
<EOS>
when
Miss
Pole
hear
of
this
,
she
nod
her
head
in
great
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
sure
we
should
hear
of
something
happen
in
Cranford
that
night
;
and
we
have
hear
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
clear
enough
they
have
first
propose
to
attack
her
house
;
but
when
they
see
that
she
and
Betty
be
on
their
guard
,
and
have
carry
off
the
plate
,
they
have
change
their
tactic
and
go
to
Mrs
Jamieson
's
,
and
no
one
know
what
may
have
happen
if
Carlo
have
not
bark
,
like
a
good
dog
as
he
be
!
  
<EOS>
Poor
Carlo
!
<EOS>
his
barking
day
be
nearly
over
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
gang
who
infest
the
neighbourhood
be
afraid
of
him
,
or
whether
they
be
revengeful
enough
,
for
the
way
in
which
he
have
baffle
them
on
the
night
in
question
,
to
poison
him
;
or
whether
,
as
some
among
the
more
uneducated
people
think
,
he
die
of
apoplexy
,
bring
on
by
too
much
feeding
and
too
little
exercise
;
at
any
rate
,
it
be
certain
that
,
two
day
after
this
eventful
night
,
Carlo
be
find
dead
,
with
his
poor
leg
stretch
out
stiff
in
the
attitude
of
run
,
as
if
by
such
unusual
exertion
he
could
escape
the
sure
pursuer
,
death
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
all
sorry
for
Carlo
,
the
old
familiar
friend
who
have
snap
at
us
for
so
many
year
;
and
the
mysterious
mode
of
his
death
make
us
very
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
Could
Signor
Brunoni
be
at
the
bottom
of
this
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
apparently
kill
a
canary
with
only
a
word
of
command
;
his
will
seem
of
deadly
force
;
who
know
but
what
he
may
yet
be
linger
in
the
neighbourhood
willing
all
sort
of
awful
thing
!
  
<EOS>
We
whisper
these
fancy
among
ourselves
in
the
evening
;
but
in
the
morning
our
courage
come
back
with
the
daylight
,
and
in
a
week
's
time
we
have
get
over
the
shock
of
Carlo
's
death
;
all
but
Mrs
Jamieson
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
poor
thing
,
feel
it
as
she
have
feel
no
event
since
her
husband
's
death
;
indeed
,
Miss
Pole
say
,
that
as
the
honourable
Mr
Jamieson
drink
a
good
deal
,
and
occasion
her
much
uneasiness
,
it
be
possible
that
Carlo
's
death
may
be
the
great
affliction
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
always
a
tinge
of
cynicism
in
Miss
Pole
's
remark
.
<EOS>
however
,
one
thing
be
clear
and
certain
 
<EOS>
it
be
necessary
for
Mrs
Jamieson
to
have
some
change
of
scene
;
and
Mr
Mulliner
be
very
impressive
on
this
point
,
shake
his
head
whenever
we
inquire
after
his
mistress
,
and
speak
of
her
loss
of
appetite
and
bad
night
very
ominously
;
and
with
justice
too
,
for
if
she
have
two
characteristic
in
her
natural
state
of
health
<EOS>
they
be
a
facility
of
eat
and
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
,
she
must
be
indeed
out
of
spirit
and
out
of
health
.

Lady
Glenmire

who
have
evidently
take
very
kindly
to
Cranford
)
do
not
like
the
idea
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
go
to
Cheltenham
,
and
more
than
once
insinuate
pretty
plainly
that
it
be
Mr
Mulliner
's
doing
,
who
have
be
much
alarm
on
the
occasion
of
the
house
be
attack
,
and
since
have
say
,
more
than
once
,
that
he
feel
it
a
very
responsible
charge
to
have
to
defend
so
many
woman
.
 
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
Mrs
Jamieson
go
to
Cheltenham
,
escort
by
Mr
Mulliner
;
and
Lady
Glenmire
remain
in
possession
of
the
house
,
her
ostensible
office
be
to
take
care
that
the
maid
-
servant
do
not
pick
up
follower
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
a
very
pleasant
-
look
dragon
;
and
,
as
soon
as
it
be
arrange
for
her
stay
in
Cranford
,
she
find
out
that
Mrs
Jamieson
's
visit
to
Cheltenham
be
just
the
good
thing
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
let
her
house
in
Edinburgh
,
and
be
for
the
time
house
-
less
,
so
the
charge
of
her
sister
-
in
-
law
's
comfortable
abode
be
very
convenient
and
acceptable
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
be
very
much
inclined
to
instal
herself
as
a
heroine
,
because
of
the
decide
step
she
have
take
in
fly
from
the
two
man
and
one
woman
,
whom
she
entitle
"
that
murderous
gang
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
describe
their
appearance
in
glow
colour
,
and
I
notice
that
every
time
she
go
over
the
story
some
fresh
trait
of
villainy
be
add
to
their
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
one
be
tall
 
<EOS>
he
grow
to
be
gigantic
in
height
before
we
have
do
with
him
;
he
of
course
have
black
hair
 
and
by
-
and
-
<EOS>
by
it
hang
in
elf
-
lock
over
his
forehead
and
down
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
be
short
and
broad
 
and
a
hump
sprout
out
on
his
shoulder
before
we
hear
the
last
of
him
;
he
have
red
hair
 
which
deepen
into
carroty
;
and
she
be
almost
sure
he
have
a
cast
in
the
eye
 
a
decide
squint
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
woman
,
her
eye
glare
,
and
she
be
masculine
-
look
 
a
perfect
virago
;
most
probably
a
man
dress
in
woman
's
clothe
;
afterwards
,
we
hear
of
a
beard
on
her
chin
,
and
a
manly
voice
and
a
stride
.
  
<EOS>
if
Miss
Pole
be
delighted
to
recount
the
event
of
that
afternoon
to
all
inquirer
,
other
be
not
so
proud
of
their
adventure
in
the
robbery
line
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hoggins
,
the
surgeon
,
have
be
attack
at
his
own
door
by
two
ruffian
,
who
be
conceal
in
the
shadow
of
the
porch
,
and
so
effectually
silence
him
that
he
be
rob
in
the
interval
between
ring
his
bell
and
the
servant
's
answer
it
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
be
sure
it
would
turn
out
that
this
robbery
have
be
commit
by
"
her
man
,
"
and
go
the
very
day
she
hear
the
report
to
have
her
tooth
examine
,
and
to
question
Mr
Hoggins
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
to
us
afterwards
;
so
we
hear
what
she
have
hear
,
straight
and
direct
from
the
source
,
while
we
be
yet
in
the
excitement
and
flutter
of
the
agitation
cause
by
the
first
intelligence
;
for
the
event
have
only
occur
the
night
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
Miss
Pole
,
sit
down
with
the
decision
of
a
person
who
have
make
up
her
mind
as
to
the
nature
of
life
and
the
world
(
and
such
people
never
tread
lightly
,
or
seat
themselves
without
a
bump
)
,
"
<EOS>
well
,
Miss
Matty
!
<EOS>
man
will
be
man
.
 
<EOS>
every
mother
's
son
of
them
wish
to
be
consider
Samson
and
Solomon
roll
into
one
 
too
strong
ever
to
be
beat
or
discomfit
 
<EOS>
too
wise
ever
to
be
outwit
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
notice
,
they
have
always
foresee
event
,
though
they
never
tell
one
for
one
's
warning
before
the
event
happen
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
be
a
man
,
and
I
know
the
sex
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
talk
herself
out
of
breath
,
and
we
should
have
be
very
glad
to
fill
up
the
necessary
pause
as
chorus
,
but
we
do
not
exactly
know
what
to
say
,
or
which
man
have
suggest
this
diatribe
against
the
sex
;
so
we
only
join
in
generally
,
with
a
grave
shake
of
the
head
,
and
a
soft
murmur
of
"
They
be
very
incomprehensible
,
certainly
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
only
think
,
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
,
I
have
undergo
the
risk
of
have
one
of
my
remaining
tooth
draw
(
for
one
be
terribly
at
the
mercy
of
any
surgeon
-
dentist
;
and
I
,
for
one
,
always
speak
them
fair
till
I
have
get
my
mouth
out
of
their
clutch
)
,
and
,
after
all
,
Mr
Hoggins
be
too
much
of
a
man
to
own
that
he
be
rob
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
rob
!
"
exclaim
the
chorus
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
tell
me
!
"
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
exclaim
,
angry
that
we
could
be
for
a
moment
impose
upon
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
be
rob
,
just
as
Betty
tell
me
,
and
he
be
ashamed
to
own
it
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
it
be
very
silly
of
him
to
be
rob
just
at
his
own
door
;
I
daresay
he
feel
that
such
a
thing
will
not
raise
him
in
the
eye
of
Cranford
society
,
and
be
anxious
to
conceal
it
 
<EOS>
but
he
nee
not
have
try
to
impose
upon
me
,
by
say
I
must
have
hear
an
exaggerated
account
of
some
petty
theft
of
a
neck
of
mutton
,
which
,
it
seem
,
be
steal
out
of
the
safe
in
his
yard
last
week
;
he
have
the
impertinence
to
add
,
he
believe
that
that
be
take
by
the
cat
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
,
if
I
could
get
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
it
be
that
Irishman
dress
up
in
woman
's
clothe
,
who
come
spy
about
my
house
,
with
the
story
about
the
starve
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
duly
condemn
the
want
of
candour
which
Mr
Hoggins
have
evince
,
and
abuse
man
in
general
,
take
him
for
the
representative
and
type
,
we
get
round
to
the
subject
about
which
we
have
be
talk
when
Miss
Pole
come
in
;
namely
,
how
far
,
in
the
present
disturb
state
of
the
country
,
we
could
venture
to
accept
an
invitation
which
Miss
Matty
have
just
receive
from
Mrs
Forrester
,
to
come
as
usual
and
keep
the
anniversary
of
her
wedding
-
day
by
drink
tea
with
her
at
five
o'clock
,
and
play
a
quiet
pool
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
have
say
that
she
ask
us
with
some
diffidence
,
because
the
road
be
,
she
fear
,
very
unsafe
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
suggest
that
perhaps
one
of
us
would
not
object
to
take
the
sedan
,
and
that
the
other
,
by
walk
briskly
,
may
keep
up
with
the
long
trot
of
the
chairman
,
and
so
we
may
all
arrive
safely
at
Over
Place
,
a
suburb
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
(
no
;
that
be
too
large
an
expression
:
 
a
small
cluster
of
house
separate
from
Cranford
by
about
two
hundred
yard
of
a
dark
and
lonely
lane
.
)
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
but
that
a
similar
note
be
await
Miss
Pole
at
home
;
so
her
call
be
a
very
fortunate
affair
,
as
it
enable
us
to
consult
together
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
all
much
rather
have
decline
this
invitation
;
but
we
feel
that
it
would
not
be
quite
kind
to
Mrs
Forrester
,
who
would
otherwise
be
leave
to
a
solitary
retrospect
of
her
not
very
happy
or
fortunate
life
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
and
Miss
Pole
have
be
visitor
on
this
occasion
for
many
year
,
and
now
they
gallantly
determine
to
nail
their
colour
to
the
mast
,
and
to
go
through
Darkness
Lane
rather
than
fail
in
loyalty
to
their
friend
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
the
evening
come
,
Miss
Matty
(
for
it
be
she
who
be
vote
into
the
chair
,
as
she
have
a
cold
)
,
before
be
shut
down
in
the
sedan
,
like
jack
-
in
-
a
-
box
,
implore
the
chairman
,
whatever
may
befall
,
not
to
run
away
and
leave
her
fasten
up
there
,
to
be
murder
;
and
even
after
they
have
promise
,
I
see
her
tighten
her
feature
into
the
stern
determination
of
a
martyr
,
and
she
give
me
a
melancholy
and
ominous
shake
of
the
head
through
the
glass
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
get
there
safely
,
only
rather
out
of
breath
,
for
it
be
who
could
trot
hardest
through
Darkness
Lane
,
and
I
be
afraid
<EOS>
poor
Miss
Matty
be
sadly
jolt
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
have
make
extra
preparation
,
in
acknowledgment
of
our
exertion
in
come
to
see
her
through
such
danger
.
 
<EOS>
the
usual
form
of
genteel
ignorance
as
to
what
her
servant
may
send
up
be
all
go
through
;
and
harmony
and
Preference
seem
likely
to
be
the
order
of
the
evening
,
but
for
an
interesting
conversation
that
begin
I
do
not
know
how
,
but
which
have
relation
,
of
course
,
to
the
robber
who
infest
the
neighbourhood
of
Cranford
.
  
<EOS>
have
brave
the
danger
of
Darkness
Lane
,
and
thus
have
a
little
stock
of
reputation
for
courage
to
fall
back
upon
;
and
also
,
I
daresay
,
desirous
of
prove
ourselves
superior
to
man
(
videlicet
Mr
Hoggins
)
in
the
article
of
candour
,
we
begin
to
relate
our
individual
fear
,
and
the
private
precaution
we
each
of
us
take
.
<EOS>
I
own
that
my
pet
apprehension
be
eye
 
<EOS>
eye
look
at
me
,
and
watch
me
,
glitter
out
from
some
dull
,
flat
,
wooden
surface
;
and
that
if
I
dare
to
go
up
to
my
looking
-
glass
when
I
be
panic
-
stricken
,
I
should
certainly
turn
it
round
,
with
its
back
towards
me
,
for
fear
of
see
eye
behind
me
look
out
of
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
see
Miss
Matty
nerve
herself
up
for
a
confession
;
and
at
last
out
it
come
.
 
<EOS>
She
own
that
,
ever
since
she
have
be
a
girl
,
she
have
dread
be
catch
by
her
last
leg
,
just
as
she
be
get
into
bed
,
by
some
one
conceal
under
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
when
she
be
young
and
more
active
,
she
use
to
take
a
fly
leap
from
a
distance
,
and
so
bring
both
her
leg
up
safely
into
bed
at
once
;
but
that
this
have
always
annoy
Deborah
,
who
pique
herself
upon
get
into
bed
gracefully
,
and
she
have
give
it
up
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
the
old
terror
would
often
come
over
her
,
especially
since
Miss
Pole
's
house
have
be
attack
(
we
have
get
quite
to
believe
in
the
fact
of
the
attack
have
take
place
)
,
and
yet
it
be
very
unpleasant
to
think
of
look
under
a
bed
,
and
see
a
man
conceal
,
with
a
great
,
fierce
face
stare
out
at
you
;
so
<EOS>
she
have
bethink
herself
of
something
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
have
notice
that
she
have
tell
Martha
to
buy
her
a
penny
ball
,
such
as
child
play
with
 
and
now
she
roll
this
ball
under
the
bed
every
night
:
 
if
it
come
out
on
the
other
side
,
well
and
good
;
if
not
she
always
take
care
to
have
her
hand
on
the
bell
-
rope
,
and
mean
to
call
out
John
and
Harry
,
just
as
if
she
expect
man
-
servant
to
answer
her
ring
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
applaud
this
ingenious
contrivance
,
and
Miss
Matty
sink
back
into
satisfied
silence
,
with
a
look
at
Mrs
Forrester
as
if
to
ask
for
HER
private
weakness
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
look
askance
at
Miss
Pole
,
and
try
to
change
the
subject
a
little
by
tell
us
that
she
have
borrow
a
boy
from
one
of
the
neighbouring
cottage
and
promise
his
parent
a
hundredweight
of
coal
at
Christmas
,
and
his
supper
every
evening
,
for
the
loan
of
him
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
instruct
him
in
his
possible
duty
when
he
first
come
;
and
,
find
him
sensible
<EOS>
,
she
have
give
him
the
Major
's
sword
(
the
Major
be
her
late
husband
)
,
and
desire
him
to
put
it
very
carefully
behind
his
pillow
at
night
,
turn
the
edge
towards
the
head
of
the
pillow
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
sharp
lad
<EOS>
,
she
be
sure
;
for
,
spy
out
the
Major
's
cocked
hat
,
he
have
say
,
if
he
may
have
that
to
wear
,
he
be
sure
he
could
frighten
two
englishman
,
or
four
frenchman
any
day
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
impress
upon
him
anew
that
he
be
to
lose
no
time
in
put
on
hat
or
anything
else
;
but
,
if
he
hear
any
noise
,
he
be
to
run
at
it
with
his
draw
sword
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
suggesting
that
some
accident
may
occur
from
such
slaughterous
and
indiscriminate
direction
,
and
that
he
may
rush
on
Jenny
get
up
to
wash
,
and
have
spit
her
<EOS>
before
he
have
discover
that
she
be
not
a
Frenchman
,
Mrs
Forrester
say
she
do
not
think
that
that
be
likely
,
for
he
be
a
very
sound
sleeper
,
and
generally
have
to
be
well
shaken
or
cold
-
pig
in
a
morning
before
they
could
rouse
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
sometimes
think
such
dead
sleep
must
be
owe
to
the
hearty
supper
the
poor
lad
eat
,
for
he
be
half
-
starve
at
home
,
and
she
tell
Jenny
to
see
that
he
get
a
good
meal
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
still
this
be
no
confession
of
Mrs
Forrester
's
peculiar
timidity
,
and
we
urge
her
to
tell
us
what
she
think
would
frighten
her
more
than
anything
.
 
<EOS>
She
pause
,
and
stir
the
fire
,
and
snuff
the
candle
,
and
then
she
say
,
in
a
sound
whisper
     
"
Ghosts
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
at
Miss
Pole
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
she
have
declare
it
,
and
would
stand
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
look
be
a
challenge
in
itself
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
come
down
upon
her
with
indigestion
,
spectral
illusion
,
optical
delusion
,
and
a
great
deal
out
of
Dr
Ferrier
and
Dr
Hibbert
besides
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
have
rather
a
leaning
to
ghost
,
as
I
have
mention
before
,
and
what
little
she
do
say
be
all
on
Mrs
Forrester
's
side
,
who
,
embolden
by
sympathy
,
protest
that
ghost
be
a
part
of
her
religion
;
that
surely
she
,
the
widow
of
a
major
in
the
army
,
know
what
to
be
frighten
at
,
and
what
not
;
in
short
,
I
never
see
Mrs
Forrester
so
warm
either
before
or
since
,
for
she
be
a
gentle
,
meek
,
endure
old
lady
in
most
thing
.
 
<EOS>
not
all
the
eld
-
wine
that
ever
be
mull
<EOS>
could
this
night
wash
out
the
remembrance
of
this
difference
between
Miss
Pole
and
her
hostess
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
when
the
eld
-
wine
be
bring
in
,
it
give
rise
to
a
new
burst
of
discussion
;
for
Jenny
,
the
little
maiden
who
stagger
under
the
tray
,
have
to
give
evidence
of
have
see
a
ghost
with
her
own
eye
,
not
so
many
night
ago
,
in
Darkness
Lane
,
the
very
lane
we
be
to
go
through
on
our
way
home
.
  
<EOS>
in
spite
of
the
uncomfortable
feeling
which
this
last
consideration
give
me
,
I
could
not
help
be
amuse
at
Jenny
's
position
,
which
be
exceedingly
like
that
of
a
witness
be
examine
and
cross
-
examine
by
two
counsel
who
be
not
at
all
scrupulous
about
ask
lead
question
.
 
<EOS>
the
conclusion
I
arrive
at
be
,
that
Jenny
have
certainly
see
something
beyond
what
a
fit
of
indigestion
would
have
cause
.
 
<EOS>
a
lady
all
in
white
,
and
without
her
head
,
be
what
she
depose
and
adhere
to
,
support
by
a
consciousness
of
the
secret
sympathy
of
her
mistress
under
the
withering
scorn
with
which
Miss
Pole
regard
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
not
only
she
,
but
many
other
,
have
see
this
headless
lady
,
who
sit
by
the
roadside
wring
her
hand
as
in
deep
grief
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
look
at
us
from
time
to
time
with
an
air
of
conscious
triumph
;
but
then
she
have
not
to
pass
through
Darkness
Lane
before
she
could
bury
herself
beneath
her
own
familiar
bed
-
clothe
.
  
<EOS>
We
preserve
a
discreet
silence
as
to
the
headless
lady
while
we
be
put
on
our
thing
to
go
home
,
for
there
be
no
know
how
near
the
ghostly
head
and
ear
may
be
,
or
what
spiritual
connection
they
may
be
keep
up
with
the
unhappy
body
in
Darkness
Lane
;
and
,
therefore
,
even
Miss
Pole
feel
that
it
be
as
well
not
to
speak
lightly
on
such
subject
,
for
fear
of
vexing
or
insult
that
woebegone
trunk
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
so
I
conjecture
;
for
,
instead
of
the
busy
clatter
usual
in
the
operation
,
we
tie
on
our
cloak
as
sadly
as
mute
at
a
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
draw
the
curtain
round
the
window
of
the
chair
to
shut
out
disagreeable
sight
,
and
the
man
(
either
because
they
be
in
spirit
that
their
labour
be
so
nearly
end
,
or
because
they
be
go
down
hill
)
,
set
off
at
such
a
round
and
merry
pace
,
that
it
be
all
Miss
Pole
and
I
could
do
to
keep
up
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
breath
for
nothing
beyond
an
imploring
<EOS>
"
do
not
leave
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
utter
as
she
clutch
my
arm
so
tightly
that
I
could
not
have
quit
her
,
ghost
or
no
ghost
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
relief
it
be
when
the
man
,
weary
of
their
burden
and
their
quick
trot
,
stop
just
where
Headingley
Causeway
branch
off
from
Darkness
Lane
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
unloose
me
and
catch
at
one
of
the
man
     
"
Could
not
you
 
could
not
you
take
Miss
Matty
round
by
Headingley
Causeway
?
 
<EOS>
the
pavement
in
Darkness
Lane
jolt
so
,
and
she
be
not
very
strong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
smothered
voice
be
hear
from
the
inside
of
the
chair
     
<EOS>
"
oh
!
pray
go
on
!
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
sixpence
more
to
go
on
very
fast
;
pray
do
not
stop
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
will
give
you
a
shilling
,
"
say
Miss
Pole
,
with
tremulous
dignity
,
"
if
you
will
go
by
Headingley
Causeway
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
two
man
grunt
acquiescence
and
take
up
the
chair
,
and
go
along
the
causeway
,
which
certainly
answer
Miss
Pole
's
kind
purpose
of
save
Miss
Matty
's
bone
;
for
it
be
cover
with
soft
,
thick
mud
,
and
even
a
fall
there
would
have
be
easy
till
the
get

up
come
,
when
there
may
have
be
some
difficulty
in
extrication

SAMUEL
BROWN
 
<EOS>
the
next
morning
I
meet
Lady
Glenmire
and
Miss
Pole
set
out
on
a
long
walk
to
find
some
old
woman
who
be
famous
in
the
neighbourhood
for
her
skill
in
knit
woollen
stocking
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
say
to
me
,
with
a
smile
half
-
kindly
and
half
-
contemptuous
upon
her
countenance
,
"
I
have
be
just
tell
Lady
Glenmire
of
our
poor
friend
Mrs
Forrester
,
and
her
terror
of
ghost
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
from
live
so
much
alone
,
and
listen
to
the
bug
-
a
-
boo
story
of
that
Jenny
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
calm
and
so
much
above
superstitious
fear
herself
that
I
be
almost
ashamed
to
say
how
glad
I
have
be
of
her
Headingley
Causeway
proposition
the
night
before
,
and
turn
off
the
conversation
to
something
else
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
Miss
Pole
call
on
Miss
Matty
to
tell
her
of
the
adventure
 
the
real
adventure
they
have
meet
with
on
their
morning
's
walk
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
be
perplex
about
the
exact
path
which
they
be
to
take
across
the
field
in
order
to
find
the
knitting
old
woman
,
and
have
stop
to
inquire
at
a
little
wayside
public
-
house
,
stand
on
the
high
road
to
London
,
about
three
mile
from
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
woman
have
ask
them
to
sit
down
and
rest
themselves
while
she
fetch
her
husband
,
who
could
direct
them
better
than
she
could
;
and
,
while
they
be
sit
in
the
sanded
parlour
,
a
little
girl
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
They
think
that
she
belong
to
the
landlady
,
and
begin
some
trifle
conversation
with
her
;
but
,
on
Mrs
Roberts
's
return
,
she
tell
them
that
the
little
thing
be
the
only
child
of
a
couple
who
be
stay
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
begin
a
long
story
,
out
of
which
Lady
Glenmire
and
Miss
Pole
could
only
gather
one
or
two
decide
fact
,
which
be
that
,
about
six
week
ago
,
a
light
spring
-
cart
have
break
down
just
before
their
door
,
in
which
there
be
two
man
,
one
woman
,
and
this
child
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
man
be
seriously
hurt
 
no
bone
break
,
only
"
shake
,
"
the
landlady
call
it
;
but
he
have
probably
sustain
some
severe
internal
injury
,
for
he
have
languish
in
their
house
ever
since
,
attend
by
his
wife
,
the
mother
of
this
little
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
have
ask
what
he
be
,
what
he
look
like
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs
Roberts
have
make
answer
that
he
be
not
like
a
gentleman
,
nor
yet
like
a
common
person
;
if
it
have
not
be
that
he
and
his
wife
be
such
decent
,
quiet
people
,
she
could
almost
have
think
he
be
a
mountebank
,
or
something
of
that
kind
,
for
they
have
a
great
box
in
the
cart
,
full
of
she
<EOS>
do
not
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
help
to
unpack
it
,
and
take
out
their
linen
and
clothe
,
when
the
other
man
 
his
twin
-
brother
,
she
believe
he
be
 
have
go
off
with
the
horse
and
cart
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
have
begin
to
have
her
suspicion
at
this
point
,
and
express
her
idea
that
it
be
rather
strange
that
the
box
and
cart
and
horse
and
all
should
have
disappear
;
but
good
Mrs
Roberts
seem
to
have
become
quite
indignant
at
Miss
Pole
's
implied
suggestion
;
in
fact
,
Miss
Pole
say
she
be
as
angry
as
if
Miss
Pole
have
tell
her
that
she
herself
be
a
swindler
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
good
way
of
convince
the
lady
,
she
bethink
her
of
beg
them
to
see
the
wife
;
and
,
as
Miss
Pole
say
,
there
be
no
doubt
the
honest
,
wear
,
bronze
face
of
the
woman
,
who
at
the
first
tender
word
from
Lady
Glenmire
,
burst
into
tear
,
which
she
be
too
weak
to
check
until
some
word
from
the
landlady
make
her
swallow
down
her
sobs
,
in
order
that
she
may
testify
to
the
christian
kindness
show
by
Mr
and
Mrs
Roberts
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
come
round
with
a
swing
to
as
vehement
a
belief
in
the
sorrowful
tale
as
she
have
be
sceptical
before
;
and
,
as
a
proof
of
this
,
her
energy
in
the
poor
sufferer
's
behalf
be
nothing
daunt
when
she
find
out
that
he
,
and
no
other
,
be
our
Signor
Brunoni
,
to
whom
all
Cranford
have
be
attribute
all
manner
of
evil
this
six
week
past
!
 
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
his
wife
say
his
proper
name
be
Samuel
Brown
 
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
<EOS>
she
call
him
 
but
to
the
last
we
prefer
call
him
"
the
Signor
"
;
it
sound
so
much
well
.
  
<EOS>
the
end
of
their
conversation
with
the
Signora
Brunoni
be
that
it
be
agree
that
he
should
be
place
under
medical
advice
,
and
for
any
expense
incur
in
procure
this
Lady
Glenmire
promise
to
hold
herself
responsible
,
and
have
accordingly
go
to
Mr
Hoggins
to
beg
him
to
ride
over
to
the
"
rise
Sun
"
that
very
afternoon
,
and
examine
into
the
signor
's
real
state
;
and
,
as
Miss
Pole
say
,
if
it
be
desirable
to
remove
him
to
Cranford
to
be
more
immediately
under
Mr
Hoggins
's
eye
,
she
would
undertake
to
see
for
lodging
and
arrange
about
the
rent
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Roberts
have
be
as
kind
as
could
be
all
throughout
,
but
it
be
evident
that
their
long
residence
there
have
be
a
slight
inconvenience
.
  
<EOS>
before
Miss
Pole
leave
us
,
Miss
Matty
and
I
be
as
full
of
the
morning
's
adventure
as
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
We
talk
about
it
all
the
evening
,
turn
it
in
every
possible
light
,
and
we
go
to
bed
anxious
for
the
morning
,
when
we
should
surely
hear
from
someone
what
Mr
Hoggins
think
and
recommend
;
for
,
as
Miss
Matty
observe
,
though
Mr
Hoggins
do
say
"
Jack
's
up
,
"
"
a
fig
for
his
heel
,
"
and
call
Preference
"
Pref
.
<EOS>
"
she
believe
he
be
a
very
worthy
man
and
a
very
clever
surgeon
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
we
be
rather
proud
of
our
doctor
at
Cranford
,
as
a
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
We
often
wish
,
when
we
hear
of
Queen
Adelaide
or
the
Duke
of
Wellington
be
ill
,
that
they
would
send
for
Mr
Hoggins
;
but
,
on
consideration
,
we
be
rather
glad
they
do
not
,
for
,
if
we
be
ail
,
what
should
we
do
if
Mr
Hoggins
have
be
appoint
physician
-
in
-
ordinary
to
the
Royal
Family
?
 
<EOS>
as
a
surgeon
we
be
proud
of
him
;
but
as
a
man
 
or
rather
,
I
should
say
,
as
a
gentleman
 
<EOS>
we
could
only
shake
our
head
over
his
name
and
himself
,
and
wish
that
he
have
read
Lord
Chesterfield
's
Letters
in
the
day
when
his
manner
be
susceptible
of
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
we
all
regard
his
dictum
in
the
signor
's
case
as
infallible
,
and
when
he
say
that
with
care
and
attention
he
may
rally
,
we
have
no
more
fear
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
although
we
have
no
more
fear
,
everybody
do
as
much
as
if
there
be
great
cause
for
anxiety
 
as
indeed
there
be
until
Mr
Hoggins
take
charge
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
look
out
clean
and
comfortable
,
if
homely
,
lodging
;
Miss
Matty
send
the
sedan
-
chair
for
him
,
and
Martha
and
I
air
it
well
before
it
leave
Cranford
by
hold
a
warming
-
pan
full
of
red
-
hot
coal
in
it
,
and
then
shut
it
up
close
,
smoke
and
all
,
until
the
time
when
he
should
get
into
it
at
the
"
rise
Sun

<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire

the
medical
department

Mr

and
rummage
up
all
Mrs
Jamieson
's
medicine
glass
,
and
spoon
,
and
bed
-
table
,
in
a
free
-
and
-
easy
way

that
make
Miss
Matty
feel
a
little
anxious
as
to
what
that

and
Mr
Mulliner
may
say
,
if
they
know

<EOS>
Mrs

for
which
she
be
so
famous

to
have
ready

<EOS>
a

jelly
be
the
high
mark

favour
<EOS>
dear
Mrs
Forrester
could
confer

<EOS>
Miss
Pole
have
once
ask
her
for
the
receipt
,
but
she
have
meet
with
a
very
decide
rebuff
;
that
lady
tell
her
that
she
could
not
part
with
it
to
any
one
during
her
life
,
and
that
after
her
death
it
be
bequeath
,
as
her
executor
would
find
,
to
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
what
Miss
Matty
,
or
,
as
Mrs
Forrester
call
her
(
remember
the
clause
in
her
will
and
the
dignity
of
the
occasion
)
,
Miss
Matilda
Jenkyns
 
may
choose
to
do
with
the
receipt
when
it
come
into
her
possession
 
whether
to
make
it
public
,
or
to
hand
it
down
as
an
heirloom
 
she
do
not
know
,
nor
would
she
dictate

<EOS>
and
a
mould
of
this
admirable
<EOS>
,
digestible
,
unique
bread
-
jelly
be
send
by
Mrs
Forrester
to
our
poor
sick
conjuror

<EOS>
who
say
that
the
aristocracy
be
proud
?
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
lady
by
birth
a
Tyrrell

and
descend
from
the

kind
feeling

out
by
this

and
also
wonderful

pale

feeble

with
his
heavy
,
filmy
eye

that
only
brighten
a
very
little
when
they
fall
upon
the
countenance
of
his
faithful
wife
,
or
their
pale
and
sorrowful
little
girl
.
  
<EOS>
somehow
we
all
forget
to
be
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
I
daresay
it
be
that
find
out
that
he
,
who
have
first
excite
our
love
of
the
marvellous
by
his
unprecedented
art

have
not
sufficient
every

day
gift
to
manage
a
shy
horse

make
us
feel
as

<EOS>
Miss
Pole
come
with
her
little
basket
at
all
hour
of
the
evening
,
as
if
her
lonely
house
and
the
unfrequented
road
to
it
have
never
be
infest
by
that
"
murderous
gang
"
;
Mrs
Forrester
say
she
think
that
neither
Jenny
nor
she
need
mind
the
headless
lady
who
weep
and
wail
in
Darkness
Lane
,
for
surely
<EOS>
the
power
be
never
give
to
such
being
to
harm
those
who
go
about
to
try
to
do
what
little
good
be
in
their
power
,
to
which
Jenny
tremblingly
assent
;
but
the
mistress
's
theory
have
little
effect
on
the
maid
's
practice
until
she
have
sew
two
piece
of
red
flannel
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
on
her
inner
garment
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
Miss
Matty
cover
her
penny
ball
 
<EOS>
the
ball
that
she
use
to
roll
under
her
bed
 
with
gay
-
coloured
worst
in
rainbow
stripes
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
my
heart
be
sad
for
that
little
careworn
child
.
 
<EOS>
although
her
father
be
a
conjuror
,
she
look
as
if
she
have
never
have
a
good
game
of
play
in
her
life

<EOS>
I
use
to
make
very
pretty
ball
in
this
way
when
I
be
a
girl
,
and
I
think
I
would
try
if
I
could
not
make
this
one
smart
and
take
it
to
Phoebe
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
"
the
gang
"
must
have
leave
the
neighbourhood
,
for
one
do
not
hear
any
more
of
their
violence
and
robbery
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
be
all
of
us
far
too
full
of
the
signor
's
precarious
state
to
talk
either
about
robber
or
ghost
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Lady
Glenmire
say
she
never
have
hear
of
any
actual
robbery
,
except
that
two
little
boy
have
steal
some
apple
from
Farmer
Benson
's
orchard
,
and
that
some
egg
have
be
miss
on
a
market
-
day
off
Widow
Hayward
's
stall
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
expect
too
much
of
us
;
we
could
not
acknowledge
that
we
have
only
have
this
small
foundation
for
all
our
panic
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
draw
herself
up
at
this
remark
of
Lady
Glenmire
's
,
and
say
"
that
she
wish
she
could
agree
with
her
as
to
the
very
small
reason
we
have
have
for
alarm
,
but
with
the
recollection
of
a
man
disguise
as
a
woman
who
have
endeavour
to
force
himself
into
her
house
while
his
confederate
wait
outside
;
with
the
knowledge
gain
from
Lady
Glenmire
herself
,
of
the
footprint
see
on
Mrs
Jamieson
's
flower
border
;
with
the
fact
before
her
of
the
audacious
robbery
commit
on
Mr
Hoggins
at
his
own
door
"
 
b
ut
here
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
break
in
with
a
very
strong
expression
of
doubt
as
to
whether
this
last
story
be
not
an
entire
fabrication
found
upon
the
theft
of
a
cat
;
she
grow
so
red
while
she
be
say
all
this
that
I
be
not
surprised
at
Miss
Pole
's
manner
of
bridle
up
,
and
I
be
certain
,
if
Lady
Glenmire
have
not
be
"
her
ladyship
,
"
we
should
have
have
a
more
emphatic
contradiction
than
the
"
well
,
to
be
sure
!
"
and
similar
fragmentary
ejaculation
,
which
be
all
that
she
venture
upon
in
my
lady
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
she
be
go
Miss
Pole
begin
a
long
congratulation
to
Miss
Matty
that
so
far
they
have
escape
marriage
,
which
she
notice
always
make
people
credulous
to
the
last
degree
;
indeed
,
she
think
it
argue
great
natural
credulity
in
a
woman
if
she
could
not
keep
herself
from
be
marry
;
and
in
what
Lady
Glenmire
have
say
about
Mr
Hoggins
's
robbery
we
have
a
speciman
of
what
people
come
to
if
they
give
way
to
such
a
weakness
;
evidently
Lady
Glenmire
would
swallow
anything
if
she
could
believe
the
poor
vamp
-
up
story
about
a
neck
of
mutton
and
a
pussy
with
which
he
have
try
to
impose
on
Miss
Pole
,
only
she
have
always
be
on
her
guard
against
believe
too
much
of
what
man
say
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
thankful
,
as
Miss
Pole
desire
us
to
be
,
that
we
have
never
be
marry
;
but
I
think
,
of
the
two
,
we
be
even
more
thankful
that
the
robber
have
leave
Cranford
;
at
least
I
judge
so
from
a
speech
of
Miss
Matty
's
that
evening
,
as
we
sit
over
the
fire
,
in
which
she
evidently
look
upon
a
husband
as
a
great
protector
against
thief
,
burglar
,
and
ghost
;
and
say
that
she
do
not
think
that
she
should
dare
to
be
always
warn
young
people
against
matrimony
,
as
Miss
Pole
do
continually
;
to
be
sure
,
marriage
be
a
risk
,
as
she
see
,
now
she
have
have
some
experience
;
but
she
remember
the
time
when
she
have
look
forward
to
be
marry
as
much
as
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
to
any
particular
person
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
hastily
check
herself
up
,
as
if
she
be
afraid
of
have
admit
too
much
;
"
only
the
old
story
,
you
know
,
of
lady
always
say
,
"
when
I
marry
,
"
and
gentleman
,
"
if
I
marry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
joke
speak
in
rather
a
sad
tone
,
and
I
doubt
if
either
of
us
smile
;
but
I
could
not
see
Miss
Matty
's
face
by
the
flickering
fire
-
light
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
little
while
she
continue
     
<EOS>
"
but
,
after
all
,
I
have
not
tell
you
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
long
ago
,
and
no
one
ever
know
how
much
I
think
of
it
at
the
time
,
unless
,
indeed
,
my
dear
mother
guess
;
but
I
may
say
that
there
be
a
time
when
I
do
not
think
I
should
have
be
only
Miss
Matty
Jenkyns
all
my
life
;
for
even
if
I
do
meet
with
any
one
who
wish
to
marry
me
now
(
and
,
as
Miss
Pole
say
,
one
be
never
too
safe
)
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
take
him
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
would
not
take
it
too
much
to
heart
,
but
I
could
not
take
him
 
or
any
one
but
<EOS>
the
person
I
once
think
I
should
be
married
to
;
and
he
be
dead
and
go
,
and
he
never
know
how
it
all
come
about
<EOS>
that
I
say
"
no
,
"
when
I
have
think
many
and
many
a
time
 
<EOS>
well
,
it
be
no
matter
what
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
God
ordain
it
all
,
and
I
be
very
happy
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
have
such
kind
friend
as
I
,
"
continue
she
,
take
my
hand
and
hold
it
in
hers
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
never
know
of
Mr
Holbrook
,
I
could
have
say
something
in
this
pause
,
but
as
I
have
,
I
could
not
think
of
anything
that
would
come
in
naturally
,
and
so
we
both
keep
silence
for
a
little
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
once
make
us
,
"
she
begin
,
"
keep
a
diary
,
in
two
column
;
on
one
side
we
be
to
put
down
in
the
morning
what
we
think
would
be
the
course
and
event
of
the
come
day
,
and
at
night
we
be
to
put
down
on
the
other
side
what
really
have
happen
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
to
some
people
rather
a
sad
way
of
tell
their
life
,
"
(
a
tear
drop
upon
my
hand
at
these
word
)
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
that
mine
have
be
sad
,
only
so
very
different
to
what
I
expect
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
one
winter
's
evening
,
sit
over
our
bedroom
fire
with
Deborah
 
<EOS>
I
remember
it
as
if
it
be
yesterday
 
<EOS>
and
we
be
plan
our
future
life
<EOS>
,
both
of
us
be
plan
,
though
only
she
talk
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
she
should
like
to
marry
an
archdeacon
,
and
write
his
charge
;
and
you
know
,
my
dear
,
she
never
be
married
,
and
,
for
aught
I
know
,
she
never
speak
to
an
unmarried
archdeacon
in
her
life

<EOS>
I
never
be
ambitious
,
nor
could
I
have
write
charge
,
but
I
think
I
could
manage
a
house
(
my
mother
use
to
call
me
her
right
hand
)
,
and
I
be
always
so
fond
of
little
child
 
<EOS>
the
shy
baby
would
stretch
out
their
little
arm
to
come
to
me
;
when
I
be
a
girl
,
I
be
half
my
leisure
time
nursing
in
the
neighbouring
cottage
;
but
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
when
I
grow
sad
and
grave
 
<EOS>
which
I
do
a
year
or
two
after
this
time
 
the
little
thing
draw
back
from
me
,
and
I
be
afraid
I
lose
the
knack
,
though
I
be
just
as
fond
of
child
as
ever
,
and
have
a
strange
yearning
at
my
heart
whenever
I
see
a
mother
with
her
baby
in
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
my
dear

(
and
by
a
sudden
blaze
which
spring
up
from
a
fall
of
the
unstirred
coal
,
I
see
that
her
eye
be
full
of
tear
 
gaze
intently
on
some
vision
of
what
may
have
be

,
"
do
you
know
<EOS>
I
dream
sometimes
that
I
have
a
little
child
 
<EOS>
always
the
same
 
a
little
girl
of
about
two
year
old

she
never
grow
old

I
have
dreamt
about
her
for
many
year

<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
ever
dream
of
any
word
or
sound
she
make

she
be
very
noiseless

still
,

she
come
to
me
when
she
be
very
sorry

very
glad

I
have
waken
with
<EOS>
the
clasp
of
her
dear
little

round
my
neck

only
last
night
 
perhaps
because
I
have
go
to
sleep
thinking
of
this
ball
for
Phoebe

my
little
darling
come
in
my
dream

put
up
her
mouth

kiss

nonsense

can
fancy
<EOS>
it
may
be
a
very
happy
state

a
little
credulity
help
one
on
through
life
very
smoothly

always
doubt

doubt

difficulty

disagreeable
in
everything

"
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
incline
to
be
daunt
from
matrimony
,
it
would
not
have
be
Miss

to
do
it
;
it
would
have
be
the
lot
of
poor
Signor
Brunoni
and
his
wife

<EOS>
and
yet
again
,
it
be
an
encouragement
to
see
how
,
through
all
their
care
and
sorrow
,
they
think
of
each
other
and
not
of
themselves
;
and
how
keen
be
their
joy
,
if
they
only
pass
through
each
other
,
or
through
the
little
Phoebe

<EOS>
the
signora
tell
me
,
one
day
,
a
good
deal
about
their
life
up
to
this
period

<EOS>
It
begin
by
my
ask
her
whether
Miss
Pole
's
story
of
the
twin
-
brother
be
true
;
it
sound
so
wonderful
a
likeness

that
I
should
have
have
my
doubt
,
if
Miss

have
not
be
unmarrie

but
the
signora
,
or
(
as
we
find
out
she
prefer
to
be
call
)
<EOS>
Mrs
Brown
,
say
it
be
quite
true
;
that
her
brother
-
in-
law
be
by
many
take
for
her
husband
,
which
be
of
great
assistance
to
them
in
their
profession

"
though
,
"
she
continue
,
"
how
people
can
mistake
Thomas
for
the
real
Signor
Brunoni

I
can
not
conceive
;

he
say
they
do
;
so
I
suppose
I
must
believe
him

<EOS>
not

what
he
be

good

I

I

in
the
ball
trick

where
my

spread
his

wide

out
his

an

Thomas

many

be
bear
,
and
I
be
strong
,
I
shall
leave
you
;
it
will
cut
my
heart
cruel
;
but
if
this
baby
die
too
,
I
shall
go
mad
;
the
madness
be
in
me
now
;
but
if
you
let
me
go
down
to
Calcutta
,
carry
my
baby
step
by
step
,
it
will
,
maybe
,
work
itself
off
;
and
I
will
save
,
and
I
will
hoard
,
and
I
will
beg
 
and
I
will
die
,
to
get
a
passage
home
to
England
,
where
our
baby
may
live
?
"
 
<EOS>
God
bless
him
!
<EOS>
he
say
I
may
go
;
and
he
save
up
his
pay
,
and
I
save
every
pice
I
could
get
for
washing
or
any
way
;
and
when
Phoebe
come
,
and
I
grow
strong
again
,
I
set
off
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
lonely
;
through
the
thick
forest
,
dark
again
with
their
heavy
tree
 
along
by
the
river
's
side
(
but
I
have
be
bring
up
near
the
Avon
in
Warwickshire
,
so
that
flow
noise
sound
like
home
)
 
from
station
to
station
,
from
indian
village
to
village
<EOS>
,
I
go
along
,
carry
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
one
of
the
officer
's
lady
with
a
little
picture
,
<EOS>
madam
 
do
by
a
catholic
foreigner
,
madam
 
of
the
Virgin
and
the
little
Saviour
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
him
on
her
arm
,
and
her
form
be
softly
curl
round
him
,
and
their
cheek
touch
.
<EOS>
well
,
when
I
go
to
bid
good
-
bye
to
this
lady
,
for
whom
I
have
wash
,
she
cry
sadly
;
for
she
,
too
,
have
lose
her
child
,
but
she
have
not
another
to
save
,
like
me
;
and
I
be
bold
enough
to
ask
her
would
she
give
me
that
print
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
cry
the
more
,
and
say
her
child
be
with
that
little
bless
Jesus
;
and
give
it
me
,
and
tell
me
that
she
have
hear
it
have
be
paint
on
the
bottom
of
a
cask
,
which
make
it
have
that
round
shape
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
my
body
be
very
weary
,
and
my
heart
be
sick
(
for
there
be
time
when
I
misdoubte
if
I
could
ever
reach
my
home
,
and
there
be
time
when
I
think
of
my
husband
,
and
<EOS>
one
time
when
I
think
my
baby
be
die
)
,
I
take
out
that
picture
and
look
at
it
,
till
I
could
have
think
the
mother
speak
to
me
,
and
comfort
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
native
be
very
kind
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
not
understand
one
another
;
but
they
see
my
baby
on
my
breast
,
and
they
come
out
to
me
,
and
bring
me
rice
and
milk
,
and
sometimes
flower
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
some
of
the
flower
dry
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
the
next
morning
,
I
be
so
tired
;
and
they
want
me
to
stay
with
them
 
<EOS>
I
could
tell
that
 
and
try
to
frighten
me
from
go
into
the
deep
wood
,
which
,
indeed
,
look
very
strange
and
dark
;
but
it
seem
to
me
as
if
death
be
follow
me
to
take
my
baby
away
from
me
;
and
as
if
I
must
go
on
,
and
on
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
how
God
have
care
for
mother
ever
since
the
world
be
make
,
and
would
care
for
me
;
so
I
bade
them
good
-
bye
,
and
set
off
afresh
.
<EOS>
and
once
when
my
baby
be
ill
,
and
both
she
and
I
need
rest
,
He
lead
me
to
a
place
where
I
find
a
kind
Englishman
live
,
right
in
the
midst
of
the
native
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
reach
Calcutta
safely
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
safely
!
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
when
I
know
I
have
only
two
day
'
journey
more
before
me
,
I
could
not
help
it
,
madam
 
<EOS>
it
may
be
idolatry
,
I
can
not
tell
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
near
one
of
the
native
temple
,
and
I
go
into
it
with
my
baby
to
thank
God
for
His
great
mercy
;
for
it
seem
to
me
that
where
other
have
pray
before
to
their
God
,
in
their
joy
or
in
their
agony
,
be
of
itself
a
sacred
place
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
get
as
servant
to
an
invalid
lady
,
who
grow
quite
fond
of
my
baby
aboard
-
ship
;
and
,
in
two
year
'
time
,
Sam
earn
his
discharge
,
and
come
home
to
me
,
and
to
our
child
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
have
to
fix
on
a
trade
;
but
he
know
of
none
;
and
once
,
once
upon
a
time
,
he
have
learn
some
trick
from
an
indian
juggler
;
so
he
set
up
conjuring
,
and
it
answer
so
well
that
he
take
Thomas
to
help
him
 
as
his
man
,
you
know
,
not
as
another
conjuror
,
though
Thomas
have
set
it
up
now
on
his
own
hook
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
have
be
a
great
help
to
us
that
likeness
between
the
twin
,
and
make
a
good
many
trick
go
off
well
that
they
make
up
together
.
 
<EOS>
and
Thomas
be
a
good
brother
,
<EOS>
only
he
have
not
the
fine
carriage
of
my
husband
,
so
that
I
can
not
think
how
he
can
be
take
for
Signor
Brunoni
himself
,
as
he
say
he
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
little
phoebe
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
my
thought
go
back
to
the
baby
she
carry
all
those
hundred
mile
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
you
may
say
so
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
think
I
should
have
rear
her
,
though
,
when
she
fall
ill
at
Chunderabaddad
;
but
that
good
,
kind
Aga
Jenkyns
take
us
in
,
which
I
believe
be
the
very
saving
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jenkyns
!
<EOS>
"
say
I.
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
Jenkyns
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
think
all
people
of
that
name
be
kind
;
for
here
be
that
nice
old
lady
who
come
every
day
to
take
Phoebe
a
walk
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
an
idea
have
flash
through
my
head
;
could
the
Aga
Jenkyns
be
the
lose
Peter
?
 
<EOS>
true
he
be
report
by
many
to
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
equally
true
,
some
have
say
that
he
have
arrive
at
the
dignity
of
Great
Lama
of
Thibet
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
think
he
be
alive
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
make
further
inquiry
.
   
<EOS>
engaged
to
be
<EOS>
MARRIED
 
<EOS>
be
the
"
poor
Peter
"
of
Cranford
the
Aga
Jenkyns
of
Chunderabaddad
,
or
be
he
not
?
 
<EOS>
as
somebody
say
,
that
be
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
in
my
own
home
,
whenever
people
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
they
blame
me
for
want
of
discretion
.
 
<EOS>
Indiscretion
be
my
bug
-
bear
fault
.
<EOS>
everybody
have
a
bug
-
bear
fault
,
a
sort
of
stand
characteristic
 
<EOS>
a
piece
de
resistance
for
their
friend
to
cut
at
;
and
in
general
they
cut
and
come
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
tired
of
be
call
indiscreet
and
incautious
;
and
I
determine
for
once
to
prove
myself
a
model
of
prudence
and
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
even
hint
my
suspicion
respect
the
Aga
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
collect
evidence
and
carry
it
home
to
lay
before
my
father
,
as
the
family
friend
of
the
two
Miss
Jenkynses
.
  
<EOS>
in
my
search
after
fact
,
I
be
often
remind
of
a
description
my
father
have
once
give
of
a
lady
'
committee
that
he
have
have
to
preside
over
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
could
not
help
think
of
a
passage
in
Dickens
,
which
speak
of
a
chorus
in
which
every
man
take
the
tune
he
know
best
,
and
sing
it
to
his
own
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
at
this
charitable
committee
,
every
lady
take
the
subject
uppermost
in
her
mind
,
and
talk
about
it
to
her
own
great
contentment
,
but
not
much
to
the
advancement
of
the
subject
they
have
meet
to
discuss
.
<EOS>
but
even
that
committee
could
have
be
nothing
to
the
Cranford
lady
when
I
attempt
to
gain
some
clear
and
definite
information
as
to
poor
Peter
's
height
,
appearance
,
and
when
and
where
he
be
see
and
hear
of
last
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
I
remember
ask
Miss
Pole
(
<EOS>
and
I
think
the
question
be
very
opportune
,
for
I
put
it
when
I
meet
her
at
a
call
at
Mrs
Forrester
's
,
and
both
the
lady
have
know
Peter
,
and
I
imagine
that
they
may
refresh
each
other
's
memory
)
 
<EOS>
I
ask
Miss
Pole
what
be
the
very
last
thing
they
have
ever
hear
about
him
;
and
then
she
name
the
absurd
report
to
which
I
have
allude
,
about
his
have
be
elect
Great
Lama
of
Thibet
;
and
this
be
a
signal
for
each
lady
to
go
off
on
her
separate
idea
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
's
start
be
make
on
the
veiled
prophet
in
Lalla
Rookh
 
whether
I
think
he
be
mean
for
the
Great
Lama
,
though
Peter
be
not
so
ugly
,
indeed
rather
handsome
,
if
he
have
not
be
freckle
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
thankful
to
see
her
double
upon
Peter
;
but
,
in
a
moment
,
the
delusive
lady
be
off
upon
Rowland
's
Kalydor
,
and
the
merit
of
cosmetic
and
hair
oil
in
general
,
and
hold
forth
so
fluently
that
I
turn
to
listen
to
Miss
Pole
,
who
(
through
the
llama
,
the
beast
of
burden
)
have
get
to
peruvian
bond
,
and
the
share
market
,
and
her
poor
opinion
of
joint
-
stock
bank
in
general
,
and
of
that
one
in
particular
in
which
Miss
Matty
's
money
be
invest
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
I
put
in
"
<EOS>
when
be
it
 
in
what
year
be
it
that
you
hear
that
Mr
Peter
be
the
Great
Lama
?
"
 
<EOS>
They
only
join
issue
to
dispute
whether
llama
be
carnivorous
animal
or
not
;
in
which
dispute
they
be
not
quite
on
fair
ground
,
as
Mrs
Forrester
(
after
they
have
grow
warm
and
cool
again
)
acknowledge
that
she
always
confuse
carnivorous
and
graminivorous
together
,
just
as
she
do
horizontal
and
perpendicular
;
but
then
she
apologise
for
it
very
prettily
,
by
say
that
in
her
day
the
only
use
people
make
of
four
-
syllable
word
be
to
teach
how
they
should
be
spelt
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
fact
I
gain
from
this
conversation
be
that
certainly
Peter
have
last
be
hear
of
in
India
,
"
or
that
neighbourhood
"
;
and
that
this
scanty
intelligence
of
his
whereabouts
have
reach
Cranford
in
the
year
when
Miss
Pole
have
bring
her
indian
muslin
gown
,
long
since
wear
out
<EOS>
(
we
wash
it
and
mend
it
,
and
trace
its
decline
and
fall
into
a
window
-
blind
before
we
could
go
on
)
;
and
in
a
year
when
Wombwell
come
to
Cranford
,
because
Miss
Matty
have
want
to
see
an
elephant
in
order
that
she
may
the
better
imagine
Peter
ride
on
one
;
and
have
see
a
boa
-
constrictor
too
,
which
be
more
than
she
wish
to
imagine
in
her
fancy
-
picture
of
Peter
's
locality
;
and
in
a
year
when
Miss
Jenkyns
have
learn
some
piece
of
poetry
off
by
heart
,
and
use
to
say
,
at
all
the
Cranford
party
,
how
Peter
be
"
survey
mankind
from
China
to
Peru
,
"
which
everybody
have
think
very
grand
,
and
rather
appropriate
,
because
India
be
between
China
and
Peru
,
if
you
take
care
to
turn
the
globe
to
the
left
instead
of
the
right
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
all
these
inquiry
of
mine
,
and
the
consequent
curiosity
excite
in
the
mind
of
my
friend
,
make
us
blind
and
deaf
to
what
be
go
on
around
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
as
if
the
sun
rise
and
shine
,
and
as
if
the
rain
rain
on
Cranford
,
just
as
usual
,
and
I
do
not
notice
any
sign
of
the
time
that
could
be
consider
as
a
prognostic
of
any
uncommon
event
;
and
,
to
the
good
of
my
belief
,
not
only
Miss
Matty
and
Mrs
Forrester
,
but
even
Miss
Pole
herself
,
whom
we
look
upon
as
a
kind
of
prophetess
,
from
the
knack
she
have
of
foresee
thing
before
they
come
to
pass
 
although
she
do
not
like
to
disturb
her
friend
by
tell
them
her
foreknowledge
 
<EOS>
even
Miss
Pole
herself
be
breathless
with
astonishment
when
she
come
to
tell
us
of
the
astounding
piece
of
news
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
recover
myself
;
the
contemplation
of
it
,
even
at
this
distance
of
time
,
have
take
away
my
breath
and
my
grammar
,
and
unless
I
subdue
my
emotion
,
my
spelling
will
go
too
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
sit
 
Miss
Matty
<EOS>
and
I
 
much
as
usual
,
she
in
the
blue
chintz
easy
-
chair
,
with
her
back
to
the
light
,
and
<EOS>
her
knitting
in
her
hand
,
I
read
aloud
<EOS>
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
minute
more
,
<EOS>
and
we
should
have
go
to
make
the
little
alteration
in
dress
usual
before
call
-
time
(
twelve
o'clock
)
in
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
scene
and
the
date
well
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
be
talk
of
the
signor
's
rapid
recovery
since
the
warm
weather
have
set
in
,
and
praise
Mr
Hoggins
's
skill
,
and
lament
his
want
of
refinement
and
manner
<EOS>
(
it
seem
a
curious
coincidence
that
this
should
have
be
our
subject
,
but
so
it
be
)
,
when
a
knock
be
hear
 
a
caller
's
knock
 
three
distinct
tap
 
<EOS>
and
we
be
fly
<EOS>
(
that
be
to
say
,
Miss
Matty
could
not
walk
very
fast
,
have
have
a
touch
of
rheumatism
)
to
our
room
,
to
change
cap
and
collar
,
when
Miss
Pole
arrest
us
by
call
out
,
as
she
come
up
the
stair
,
"
do
not
go
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
wait
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
twelve
,
I
know
 
<EOS>
but
never
mind
your
dress
 
<EOS>
I
must
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
do
our
good
to
look
as
if
it
be
not
we
who
have
make
the
hurried
movement
,
the
sound
of
which
she
have
hear
;
for
,
of
course
,
we
do
not
like
to
have
it
suppose
that
we
have
any
old
clothe
that
it
be
convenient
to
wear
out
in
the
"
sanctuary
of
home
,
"
as
Miss

so
we
throw
our
gentility

for
two
minute
while
Miss
Pole
recover
breath

and
excite
our
curiosity
strongly
by
lift
up
her
hand
in
amazement
,
and
bring
them
down
in
silence
,
as
if
what
she
have
to

be
too
big
for

and
could
only

express
by
pantomime

<EOS>
I

You

in

Miss

sigh
as

recover
from
a

perhaps
it

perhaps

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
say
Miss

<EOS>
"
I
have
take
care
to
ascertain
that

<EOS>
I
go
straight
to
Mrs
Fitz

Adam
,
to
borrow
a
cookery

book
which
I
know
she
have

and
I
introduce
my
congratulation
a

of
the
difficulty
gentleman
must
have
in
house

keeping

and
Mrs
Fitz

Adam
bridle
up
,
and
say
that
she
believe
it
be
true
,
though
how
and
where
I
could
have
hear
it
<EOS>
she
do
not

<EOS>
She
say
her
brother

have
come
to
an
understanding
at
last

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
understanding
!
"
<EOS>
such
a
coarse
word

<EOS>
but
my
lady
will
have
to
come
down
to
many
a
want
of
refinement

<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
believe
Mr

sup
on
bread

and
-
cheese
and
beer
every
night

<EOS>
"

once
again

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

<EOS>
I
never

<EOS>
two
people
that

It
be
come
very
near

"
so
near
that
my

"
one

Bah

"
<EOS>
well

<EOS>
there
be
a
kind

attraction
about

for

should
be
ashamed

have

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
in
my
wonder

<EOS>
"
but
how
can
she
have
fancy
Mr
Hoggins
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
surprised
that
Mr

have
like
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
do

Mr

be
rich

very
pleasant-
look

say
Miss

,
"
and
very
good
-
temper

kind-
hearted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
marry
for
an
establishment
,
that
be
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
take
the
surgery
with
it
,
"
say
Miss
Pole
,
with
a
little
dry
laugh
at
her
own
joke
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
like
many
people
who
think
they
have
make
a
severe
and
sarcastic
speech
,
which
yet
be
clever
of
its
kind
,
she
begin
to
relax
in
her
grimness
from
the
moment
when
she
make
this
allusion
to
the
surgery
;
and
we
turn
to
speculate
on
the
way
in
which
Mrs
Jamieson
would
receive
the
news
.
 
<EOS>
the
person
whom
she
have
leave
in
charge
of
her
house
to
keep
off
follower
from
her
maid
to
set
up
a
follower
of
her
own
!
 
<EOS>
and
that
follower
a
man
whom
Mrs
Jamieson
have
taboo
as
vulgar
,
and
inadmissible
to
Cranford
society
,
not
merely
on
account
of
his
name
,
<EOS>
but
because
of
his
voice
,
his
complexion
,
his
boot
,
smell
of
the
stable
,
and
himself
,
smell
of
drug
.
 
<EOS>
have
he
ever
be
to
see
Lady
Glenmire
at
Mrs
Jamieson
's
?
 
<EOS>
chloride
of
lime
would
not
purify
the
house
in
its
owner
's
estimation
if
he
have
.
 
<EOS>
or
have
their
interview
be
confine
to
the
occasional
meeting
in
the
chamber
of
the
poor
sick
conjuror
,
to
whom
,
with
all
our
sense
of
the
mesalliance
,
we
could
not
help
allow
that
they
have
both
be
exceedingly
kind
?
 
<EOS>
and
now
it
turn
out
that
a
servant
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
have
be
ill
,
and
Mr
Hoggins
have
be
attend
her
for
some
week
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
wolf
have
get
into
the
fold
,
and
now
he
be
carry
off
the
shepherdess
.
<EOS>
what
would
Mrs
Jamieson
say
?
 
<EOS>
We
look
into
the
darkness
of
futurity
as
a
child
gaze
after
a
rocket
up
in
the
cloudy
sky
,
full
of
wonder
expectation
of
the
rattle
,
the
discharge
,
and
the
brilliant
shower
of
spark
and
light
.
 
<EOS>
then
we
bring
ourselves
down
to
earth
and
<EOS>
the
present
time
by
question
each
other
(
be
all
equally
ignorant
,
and
all
equally
without
the
slight
datum
to
build
any
conclusion
upon
)
<EOS>
as
to
when
it
would
take
place
?
 
<EOS>
where
?
<EOS>
how
much
a
year
Mr
Hoggins
have
?
 
<EOS>
whether
she
would
drop
her
title
?
<EOS>
and
how
Martha
and
the
other
correct
servant
in
Cranford
would
ever
be
bring
to
announce
a
married
couple
as
Lady
Glenmire
and
Mr
Hoggins
?
 
<EOS>
but
would
they
be
visit
?
 
<EOS>
Would
Mrs
Jamieson
let
us
?
<EOS>
or
must
we
choose
between
the
honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
and
the
degraded
Lady
Glenmire
?
 
<EOS>
We
all
like
Lady
Glenmire
the
good
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
bright
,
and
kind
,
and
sociable
,
and
agreeable
;
and
Mrs
Jamieson
be
dull
,
and
inert
,
and
pompous
,
and
tiresome
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
have
acknowledge
the
sway
of
the
latter
so
long
,
that
it
seem
like
a
kind
of
disloyalty
now
even
to
meditate
disobedience
to
the
prohibition
we
anticipate
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
surprise
us
in
our
darn
cap
and
patch
collar
;
and
we
forget
all
about
them
in
our
eagerness
to
see
how
she
would
bear
the
information
,
which
we
honourably
leave
to
Miss
Pole
,
to
impart
,
although
,
if
we
have
be
incline
to
take
unfair
advantage
,
we
may
have
rush
in
ourselves
,
for
she
have
a
most
out
-
of
-
place
fit
of
cough
for
five
minute
after
Mrs
Forrester
enter
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
the
imploring
expression
of
her
eye
,
as
she
look
at
us
over
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
,
as
plain
as
word
could
speak
,
"
do
not
let
Nature
deprive
me
of
the
treasure
which
be
mine
,
although
for
a
time
I
can
make
no
use
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
we
do
not
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
's
surprise
be
equal
to
ours
;
and
her
sense
of
injury
rather
great
,
because
she
have
to
feel
for
her
order
,
and
see
more
fully
than
we
could
do
how
such
conduct
bring
stain
on
the
aristocracy
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
and
Miss
Pole
leave
us
we
endeavour
to
subside
into
calmness
;
but
Miss
Matty
be
really
upset
by
the
intelligence
she
have
hear
.
 
<EOS>
She
reckon
it
up
,
and
it
be
more
than
fifteen
year
since
she
have
hear
of
any
of
her
acquaintance
go
to
be
marry
,
with
the
one
exception
of
Miss
Jessie
Brown
;
and
,
as
she
say
,
it
give
her
quite
a
shock
,
and
make
her
feel
as
if
she
could
not
think
what
would
happen
next
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
a
fancy
of
mine
,
or
a
real
fact
,
but
I
have
notice
that
,
just
after
the
announcement
of
an
engagement
in
any
set
,
the
unmarried
lady
in
that
set
flutter
out
in
an
unusual
gaiety
and
newness
of
dress
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
in
a
tacit
and
unconscious
manner
,
"
We
also
be
spinster
.
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
and
Miss
Pole
talk
and
think
more
about
bonnet
,
gown
,
cap
,
and
shawl
,
during
the
fortnight
that
succeed
this
call
,
than
I
have
know
them
do
for
year
before
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
the
spring
weather
,
for
it
be
a
warm
and
pleasant
March
;
and
merinoe
and
beaver
,
and
woollen
material
of
all
sort
be
but
ungracious
receptacle
of
the
bright
sun
's
glancing
ray
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
not
be
Lady
Glenmire
's
dress
that
have
win
Mr
Hoggins
's
heart
,
for
she
go
about
on
her
errand
of
kindness
more
shabby
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
although
in
the
hurried
glimpse
I
catch
of
her
at
church
or
elsewhere
she
appear
rather
to
shun
meet
any
of
her
friend
<EOS>
,
her
face
seem
to
have
almost
something
of
the
flush
of
youth
in
it
;
her
lip
look
red
and
more
tremble
full
than
in
their
old
compress
state
,
and
her
eye
dwelt
on
all
thing
with
a
linger
light
,
as
if
she
be
learn
to
love
Cranford
and
its
belonging
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hoggins
look
broad
and
radiant
,
and
creak
up
the
middle
aisle
at
church
in
a
brand
-
new
pair
of
top
-
boot
 
<EOS>
an
audible
,
as
well
as
visible
,
sign
of
his
purposed
change
of
state
;
for
the
tradition
go
,
that
the
boot
he
have
wear
till
now
be
the
identical
pair
in
which
he
first
set
out
on
his
round
in
Cranford
twenty
-
five
year
ago
;
only
they
have
be
new
-
piece
,
high
and
low
,
top
and
bottom
,
heel
and
sole
,
black
leather
and
brown
leather
,
more
time
than
any
one
could
tell
.
  
<EOS>
none
of
the
lady
in
Cranford
choose
to
sanction
the
marriage
by
congratulate
either
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
We
wish
to
ignore
the
whole
affair
until
our
liege
lady
,
Mrs
Jamieson
,
return
.
 
<EOS>
till
she
come
back
to
give
us
our
cue
,
we
feel
that
it
would
be
well
to
consider
the
engagement
in
the
same
light
as
the
Queen
of
Spain
's
leg
 
fact
which
certainly
exist
,
but
the
less
say
about
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
this
restraint
upon
our
tongue
 
for
<EOS>
you
see
if
we
do
not
speak
about
it
to
any
of
the
party
concern
,
how
could
we
get
answer
to
the
question
that
we
long
to
ask
?
 
<EOS>
be
begin
to
be
irksome
,
and
our
idea
of
the
dignity
of
silence
be
pale
before
our
curiosity
,
when
another
direction
be
give
to
our
thought
,
by
an
announcement
on
the
part
of
the
principal
shopkeeper
of
Cranford
,
who
range
the
trade
from
grocer
and
cheesemonger
to
man
-
milliner
,
as
occasion
require
,
that
the
spring
fashion
be
arrive
,
and
would
be
exhibit
on
the
follow
Tuesday
at
his
room
in
High
Street
.
 
<EOS>
now
Miss
Matty
have
be
only
wait
for
this
before
buy
herself
a
new
silk
gown
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
offer
,
it
be
true
,
to
send
to
Drumble
for
pattern
,
but
she
have
reject
my
proposal
,
gently
imply
that
she
have
not
forget
her
disappointment
about
the
sea
-
green
turban
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
thankful
that
I
be
on
the
spot
now
,
to
counteract
the
dazzling
fascination
of
any
yellow
or
scarlet
silk
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
say
a
word
or
two
here
about
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
speak
of
my
father
's
old
friendship
for
the
Jenkyns
family
;
indeed
,
I
be
not
sure
if
there
be
not
some
distant
relationship
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
willingly
allow
me
to
remain
all
the
winter
at
Cranford
,
in
consideration
of
a
letter
which
Miss
Matty
have
write
to
him
about
the
time
of
the
panic
,
in
which
I
suspect
she
have
exaggerate
my
power
and
my
bravery
as
a
defender
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
that
the
day
be
long
and
more
cheerful
,
he
be
begin
to
urge
the
necessity
of
my
return
;
and
I
only
delay
in
a
sort
of
odd
forlorn
hope
that
if
I
could
obtain
any
clear
information
,
I
may
make
the
account
give
by
the
signora
of
the
Aga
Jenkyns
tally
with
that
of
"
poor
Peter
,
"
his
appearance
and
disappearance
,
which
I
have
winnow
out
of
the
conversation
of
Miss
Pole
and
Mrs
Forrester
.
   
<EOS>
STOPPED
PAYMENT
 
<EOS>
the
very
Tuesday
morning
on
which
Mr
Johnson
be
go
to
show
the
fashion
,
the
post
-
woman
bring
two
letter
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
the
post
-
woman
,
but
I
should
say
the
postman
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
lame
shoemaker
,
a
very
clean
,
honest
man
,
much
respect
in
the
town
;
but
he
never
bring
the
letter
round
except
on
unusual
occasion
,
such
as
Christmas
Day
or
Good
Friday
;
and
on
those
day
the
letter
,
which
should
have
be
deliver
at
eight
in
the
morning
,
do
not
make
their
appearance
until
two
or
three
in
the
afternoon
,
for
every
one
like
poor
Thomas
,
and
give
him
a
welcome
on
these
festive

He
use
to
say
,
"
He
be
welly
stawe
wi

eating
,
for
there
be
three
or
four
house
where

but
he
must
share
in
their

and
by
the
time
he
have
do
his
last
breakfast
,
he
come
to
some
other
friend
who
be
begin
dinner
;
but
come
what
may
in
the
way
of
temptation
<EOS>
,
Tom
be
always
sober
,
civil
,
and
smile
;
and
,
as
Miss
Jenkyns
use
to
say
,
it
be
a
lesson
in
patience
,
that
she
doubt
not
would
call
out
that
precious
quality
in
some
mind
,
where
,
but
for
Thomas
,
it
may
have
lain
dormant
and
undiscovered
.
 
<EOS>
Patience
be
certainly
very
dormant
in
Miss
Jenkyns
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
always
expect
letter
,
and
always
drum
on
the
table
till
the
post
-
woman
have
call
or
go
past
.
 
<EOS>
on
Christmas
Day
and
<EOS>
Good
Friday
she
drum
from
breakfast
till
church
,
from
church
-
time
till
two
o'clock
 
unless
when
the
fire
want
stir
,
when
she
invariably
knock
down
the
fire
-
iron
,
and
scold
Miss
Matty
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
equally
certain
be
the
hearty
welcome
and
the
good
dinner
for
Thomas
;
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
stand
over
him
like
a
bold
dragoon
,
question
him
as
to
his
child
 
what
they
be
do
 
<EOS>
what
school
they
go
to
;
upbraid
him
if
another
be
likely
to
make
its
appearance
,
but
send
even
the
little
baby
the
shilling
and
the
mince
-
pie
which
be
her
gift
to
all
the
child
,
with
half
-
a
-
crown
in
addition
for
both
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
the
post
be
not
half
of
so
much
consequence
to
dear
Miss
Matty
;
but
not
for
the
world
would
she
have
diminish
Thomas
's
welcome
and
his
dole
,
though
I
could
see
that
she
feel
rather
shy
over
the
ceremony
,
which
have
be
regard
by
Miss
Jenkyns
as
a
glorious
opportunity
for
give
advice
and
benefit
her
fellow
-
creature
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
would
steal
the
money
all
in
a
lump
into
his
hand
,
as
if
she
be
ashamed
of
herself
.
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
give
him
each
individual
coin
separate
,
with
a
"
there
!
<EOS>
that
be
for
yourself
;
that
be
for
Jenny
,
"
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
would
even
beckon
Martha
out
of
the
kitchen
while
he
eat
his
food
:
 
and
once
,
to
my
knowledge
,
wink
at
its
rapid
disappearance
into
a
blue
cotton
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
almost
scold
him
if
he
do
not
leave
a
clean
plate
,
however
heap
it
may
have
be
,
and
give
an
injunction
with
every
mouthful
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
wander
a
long
way
from
the
two
letter
that
await
us
on
the
breakfast
-
table
that
Tuesday
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
be
from
my
father
.
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
's
be
print
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
's
be
just
a
man
's
letter
;
I
mean
it
be
very
dull
,
and
give
no
information
beyond
that
he
be
well
,
that
they
have
have
a
good
deal
of
rain
,
that
trade
be
very
stagnant
,
and
there
be
many
disagreeable
rumour
afloat
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
ask
me
if
I
know
whether
Miss
Matty
still
retain
her
share
in
the
Town
and
County
Bank
,
as
there
be
very
unpleasant
report
about
it
;
though
nothing
more
than
he
have
always
foresee
,
and
have
prophesy
to
Miss
Jenkyns
year
ago
,
when
she
would
invest
their
little
property
in
it
 
the
only
unwise
step
that
clever
woman
have
ever
take
,
to
his
knowledge
(
the
only
time
she
ever
act
against
his
advice
,
I
know
)
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
if
anything
have
go
wrong
,
of
course
I
be
not
to
think
of
leave
Miss
Matty
while
I
could
be
of
any
use
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
your
letter
from
,
my
dear

<EOS>
Mine
be
a
very
civil
invitation
,

"
Edwin
Wilson

"
ask
me
to
attend
an
important
meeting
of
the
shareholder
of
the
Town
and
County
Bank
,
to
be
hold
in
Drumble
,
on
Thursday
the
twenty

first
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
<EOS>
,
it
be
very
attentive
of
them
to
remember
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
hear
of
this
"
important
meeting
,
"
for
,
though
I
do
not
know
much
about
business
,
I
fear
it
confirm
what
my
father
say
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
think
,
ill
news
always
come
fast
enough
,
so
I
resolve
to
say
nothing
about
my
alarm
,
and
merely
tell
her
that
my
father
be
well
,
and
send
his
kind
regard
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
keep
turn
over
and
admire
her
letter
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
speak
     
<EOS>
"
I
remember
their
send
one
to
Deborah
just
like
this
;
but
that
I
do
not
wonder
at
,
for
everybody
know
she
be
so
clear
-
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
could
not
help
them
much
;
indeed
,
if
they
come
to
account
,
I
should
be
quite
in
the
way
,
for
I
never
could
do
sum
in
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
Deborah
,
I
know
,
rather
wish
to
go
,
and
go
so
far
as
to
order
a
new
bonnet
for
the
occasion
:
 
but
when
the
time
come
she
have
a
bad
cold
;
so
they
send
her
a
very
polite
account
of
what
they
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
choose
a
director
,
I
think
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
they
want
me
to
help
them
to
choose
a
director
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
should
choose
your
father
at
once
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
have
no
share
in
the
bank
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
I
remember
.
 
<EOS>
He
object
very
much
to
Deborah
's
buy
any
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
quite
the
woman
of
business
,
and
always
judge
for
herself
;
and
here
,
you
see
,
they
have
pay
eight
per
cent
.
<EOS>
all
these
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
uncomfortable
subject
to
me
,
with
my
half
-
knowledge
;
so
I
think
I
would
change
the
conversation
,
and
I
ask
at
what
time
she
think
we
have
better
go
and
see
the
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
she
say
,
"
the
thing
be
this
:
 
it
be
not
etiquette
to
go
till
after
twelve
;
but
then
,
you
see
,
all
Cranford
will
be
there
,
and
one
do
not
like
to
be
too
curious
about
dress
and
trimming
and
cap
with
all
the
world
look
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
never
genteel
to
be
over
-
curious
on
these
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Deborah
have
the
knack
of
always
look
as
if
the
late
fashion
be
nothing
new
to
her
;
a
manner
she
have
catch
from
Lady
Arley
,
who
do
see
all
the
new
mode
in
London
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
think
we
would
just
slip
down
 
for
I
do
want
this
morning
,
soon
after
breakfast
half
-
a
-
pound
of
tea
 
<EOS>
and
then
we
could
go
up
and
examine
the
thing
at
our
leisure
,
and
see
exactly
how
my
new
silk
gown
must
be
make
;
and
then
,
after
twelve
,
we
could
go
with
our
mind
disengaged
,
and
free
from
thought
of
dress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
begin
to
talk
of
Miss
Matty
's
new
silk
gown
.
 
<EOS>
I
discover
that
it
would
be
really
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
have
have
to
choose
anything
of
consequence
for
herself
:
 
for
Miss
Jenkyns
have
always
be
the
more
decide
character
,
whatever
her
taste
may
have
be
;
and
it
be
astonishing
how
such
people
carry
the
world
before
them
by
the
mere
force
of
will
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
anticipate
the
sight
of
the
glossy
fold
with
as
much
delight
as
if
the
five
sovereign
,
set
apart
for
the
purchase
,
could
buy
all
the
silk
in
the
shop
;
and
(
remember
my
own
loss
of
two
hour
in
a
toyshop
before
I
could
tell
on
what
wonder
to
spend
a
silver
threepence
)
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
that
we
be
go
early
,
that
dear
Miss
Matty
may
have
leisure
for
the
delight
of
perplexity
.
  
<EOS>
if
a
happy
sea
-
green
could
be
meet
with
,
the
gown
be
to
be
sea
-
green
:
if
not
,
she
incline
to
maize
,
and
I
to
silver
gray
;
and
we
discuss
the
requisite
number
of
breadth
until
we
arrive
at
the
shop
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
to
buy
the
tea
,
select
the
silk
,
and
then
clamber
up
the
iron
corkscrew
stair
that
lead
into
what
be
once
a
loft
,
though
now
a
fashion
show
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
man
at
Mr
Johnson
's
have
on
their
good
look
;
and
their
good
cravat
,
and
pivot
themselves
over
the
counter
with
surprising
activity
.
 
<EOS>
They
want
to
show
us
upstairs
at
once
;
but
on
the
principle
of
business
first
and
pleasure
afterwards
,
we
stay
to
purchase
the
tea
.
 
<EOS>
here
Miss
Matty
's
absence
of
mind
betray
itself
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
be
make
aware
that
she
have
be
drink
green
tea
at
any
time
,
she
always
think
it
her
duty
to
lie
awake
half
through
the
night
afterward
(
I
have
know
her
take
it
in
ignorance
many
a
time
without
such
effect
)
,
and
consequently
green
tea
be
prohibit
the
house
;
yet
to
-
day
<EOS>
she
herself
ask
for
the
obnoxious
article
,
under
the
impression
that
she
be
talk
about
the
silk
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
mistake
be
soon
rectify
;
and
then
the
silk
be
unrolled
in
good
truth
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
shop
be
pretty
well
fill
,
for
it
be
Cranford
market
-
day
,
and
many
of
the
farmer
and
country
people
from
the
neighbourhood
round
come
in
,
sleek
down
their
hair
,
and
glance
shyly
about
,
from
under
their
eyelid
,
as
anxious
to
take
back
some
notion
of
the
unusual
gaiety
to
the
mistress
or
the
lass
at
home
,
and
yet
feel
that
they
be
out
of
place
among
the
smart
shopman
and
gay
shawl
and
summer
print
.
 
<EOS>
one
honest
-
looking
man
,
however
,
make
his
way
up
to
the
counter
at
which
we
stand
,
and
boldly
ask
to
look
at
a
shawl
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
country
folk
confine
themselves
to
the
grocery
side
;
but
our
neighbour
be
evidently
too
full
of
some
kind
intention
towards
mistress
,
wife
or
daughter
,
to
be
shy
;
and
it
soon
become
a
question
with
me
,
whether
he
or
Miss
Matty
would
keep
their
shopman
the
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
each
shawl
more
beautiful
than
the
last
;
and
,
as
for
Miss
Matty
,
she
smile
and
sigh
over
each
fresh
bale
that
be
bring
out
;
one
colour
set
off
another
,
and
the
heap
together
would
,
as
she
say
,
make
even
the
rainbow
look
poor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
"
say
she
,
hesitating
,
"
<EOS>
whichever
I
choose
I
shall
wish
I
have
take
another
.
 
<EOS>
look
at
this
lovely
crimson
!
<EOS>
it
would
be
so
warm
in
winter
.
 
<EOS>
but
spring
be
come
on
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
have
a
gown
for
every
season
,
"
say
she
,
drop
her
voice
 
as
we
all
do
in
Cranford
whenever
we
talk
of
anything
we
wish
for
but
could
not
afford
.
 
<EOS>
"
however
,
"
she
continue
in
a
loud
and
more
cheerful
tone
,
"
it
would
give
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
take
care
of
them
if
I
have
them
;
so
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
I
will
only
take
one
.
<EOS>
but
which
must
it
be
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
and
now
she
hover
over
a
lilac
with
yellow
spot
,
while
I
pull
out
a
quiet
sage
-
green
that
have
fade
into
insignificance
under
the
more
brilliant
colour
,
but
which
be
nevertheless
a
good
silk
in
its
humble
way
.
 
<EOS>
Our
attention
be
call
off
to
our
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
choose
a
shawl
of
about
thirty
shilling
'
value
;
and
his
face
look
broadly
happy
,
under
the
anticipation
,
no
doubt
,
of
the
pleasant
surprise
he
would
give
to
some
Molly
or
Jenny
at
home
;
he
have
tug
a
leathern
purse
out
of
his
breech
-
pocket
,
and
have
offer
a
five
-
pound
note
in
payment
for
the
shawl
,
and
for
some
parcel
which
have
be
bring
round
to
him
from
the
grocery
counter
;
and
it
be
just
at
this
point
that
he
attract
our
notice
.
 
<EOS>
the
shopman
be
examine
the
note
with
a
puzzled
,
doubtful
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
Town
and
County
Bank
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
,
sir
,
but
I
believe
we
have
receive
a
warning
against
note
issue
by
this
bank
only
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
just
step
and
ask
Mr
Johnson
,
sir
;
but
I
be
afraid
I
must
trouble
you
for
payment
in
cash
,
or
in
a
note
of
a
different
bank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
man
's
countenance
fall
so
suddenly
into
dismay
and
bewilderment
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
almost
piteous
to
see
the
rapid
change
.
  
<EOS>
"
dang
it
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
strike
his
fist
down
on
the
table
,
as
if
to
try
which
be
the
hard
<EOS>
,
"
the
chap
talk
as
if
note
and
gold
be
to
be
have
for
the
picking
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
have
forget
her
silk
gown
in
her
interest
for
the
man
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
she
have
catch
the
name
of
the
bank
,
and
in
my
nervous
cowardice
I
be
anxious
that
she
should
not
;
and
so
I
begin
admire
the
yellow
-
spot
lilac
<EOS>
gown
that
I
have
be
utterly
condemn
only
a
minute
before
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
of
no
use
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
bank
be
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
what
bank
do
your
note
belong
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Town
and
County
Bank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
see
it
,
"
say
she
quietly
to
the
shopman
,
gently
take
it
out
of
his
hand
,
as
he
bring
it
back
to
return
it
to
the
farmer
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Johnson
be
very
sorry
,
but
,
from
information
he
have

little
well
than

paper

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
it
,
"
say
Miss
Matty
to
me
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
our
bank
,
be
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
the
Town
and
County
Bank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
this
lilac
silk
will
just
match
the
ribbon
in
your
new
cap
,
I
believe
,
"
I
continue
,
hold
up
the
fold
so
as
to
catch
the
light
,
and
wish
that
the
man
would
make
haste
and
be
go
,
and
yet
have
a
new
wonder
,
that
have
only
just
spring
up
,
how
far
it
be
wise
or
right
in
me
to
allow
Miss
Matty
to
make
this
expensive
purchase
,
if
the
affair
of
the
bank
be
really
so
bad
as
the
refusal
of
the
note
imply
.
  
<EOS>
but
Miss
Matty
put
on
the
soft
dignified
manner
,
peculiar
to
her
,
rarely
use
,
and
yet
<EOS>
which
become
her
so
well
,
and
lay
her
hand
gently
on
mine
,
she
say
     
"
never
mind
the
silk
for
a
few
minute
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
you
,
sir

"
turn
now
to
the
shopman
,
who
have
be
attend
to
the
farmer

<EOS>
"
be
this
a
forge
note
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
true
note
of
its
kind
;
but
you
see
,
madam
,
it
be
a
joint
-
stock
bank
,
and
there
be
report
out
that
it
be
likely
to
break
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Johnson
be
only
do
his
duty
,
madam
,
as
I
be
sure
Mr
Dobson
know
.

<EOS>

Mr
Dobson
could
not
respond
to
the
appealing
bow
by
any
answer
smile

<EOS>
He
be
turn
the
note
absently
over
in
his
finger

look
gloomily
enough
at
the
parcel

the
lately

choose
shawl

It
be
hard
upon
a
poor
man

he

earn
every

the
sweat
of
his
brow

<EOS>
however
,
there
be
no
help
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
take
back
your
shawl
,
my
man
;
Lizzle
must
go
on
with
her
cloak
for
a
while
.
 
<EOS>
and
yon
fig
for
the
little
one
 
<EOS>
I
promise
them
to
'em
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
them
;

the

bacco
,

the
other
thing

<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
five
sovereign
for
your
note
,
my
good
man

"
say
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
be
some
great
mistake
about
it

I
be
one
of
the
shareholder

I
be
sure
they
would
have
tell
me

on
right

<EOS>
the
shopman
whisper
a
word
or
two
across
the
table
to
Miss
Matty
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
with
a
dubious
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
so
,
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
pretend
to
understand
business
;
I
only
know
that
if
it
be
go
to
fail
,
and
if
honest
people
be
to
lose
their
money
because
they
have
take
our
note
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
explain
myself
,
"
say
she
,
suddenly
become
aware
that
she
have
get
into
a
long
sentence
with
four
people
for
audience
;
"
only
I
would
rather
exchange
my
gold
for
the
note
,
if
you
please
,

turn
to
the
farmer

and
then
you
can
take
your
wife
the
shawl

<EOS>
It
be
only
go
without
my
gown
a
few
day
longer

she
continue
,
speak
to
me

"
then
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
everything
will
be
clear
up

<EOS>

if
it
be
clear
up
the
wrong
way

say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
it
will
only
have
be
common
honesty
in
me

to
have
give
this
good

the
money

<EOS>
I
be
quite
clear
about
it

you

I
can
never

comprehensibly
as

can

you
must
give
me
your
note

Mr

on
with
your
purchase
with
these
sovereign
.

"
  
<EOS>
the
man
look
at
her
with
silent
gratitude
 
too
awkward
to
put
his
thank
into
word
;
but
he
hang
back
for
a
minute
or
two
,
fumble
with
his
note

<EOS>
"
I
be
loth
to
make
another
one
lose
instead

,
you
see
,
five
pound
be
a
deal
of
money
to
a
man
with
a
family
;
and
,
as
you
say
,
ten
to
one
in
a
day
or
two
the
note
will
be
as
good
as
gold
again

<EOS>
"
no
hope
of
that
,
my
friend
,
"

the
shopman
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
more
reason
why
I
should
take
it
,
"
say
Miss
Matty
quietly
.
<EOS>
She
push
her
sovereign
towards
the
man
,
who
slowly
lay
his
note
down
in
exchange
.
 
<EOS>
"
thank
you

<EOS>
I
will
wait
a
day

two
before
I

any

you
will
then
have
a
great
choice
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
will
you
come
upstairs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
inspect
the
fashion
with
as
minute
and
curious
an
interest
as
if
the
gown
to
be
make
after
them
have
be
buy
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
that
the
little
event
in
the
shop
below
have
in
the
least
damp
Miss
Matty
's
curiosity
as
to
the
make
of
sleeve
or
the
sit
of
skirt
.
 
<EOS>
She
once
or
twice
exchange
congratulation
with
me
on
our
private
and
leisurely
view
of
the
bonnet
and
shawl
;
but
I
be
,
all
the
time
,
not
so
sure
that
our
examination
be
so
utterly
private
,
for
I
catch
glimpse
of
a
figure
dodge
behind
the
cloak
and
mantle
;
and
,
by
a
dexterous
move
,
I
come
face
to
face
with
Miss
Pole
,
also
in
morning
costume
(
<EOS>
the
principal
feature
of
which
be
her
be
without
tooth
,
and
wear
a
veil
to
conceal
the
deficiency
)
,
come
on
the
same
errand
as
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
quickly
take
her
departure
,
because
,
as
she
say
,
she
have
a
bad
headache
,
and
do
not
feel
herself
up
to
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
come
down
through
the
shop
,
the
civil
Mr
Johnson
be
await
us
;
he
have
be
inform
of
the
exchange
of
the
note
for
gold
,
and
with
much
good
feeling
and
real
kindness
,
but
with
a
little
want
of
tact
,
he
wish
to
condole
with
Miss
Matty
,
and
impress
upon
her
the
true
state
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
hope
that
he
have
hear
an
exaggerated
rumour
for
<EOS>
he
say
that
her
share
be
bad
than
nothing
,
and
that
the
bank
could
not
pay
a
shilling
in
the
pound
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
that
Miss
Matty
seem
still
a
little
incredulous
;
but
I
could
not
tell
how
much
of
this
be
real
or
assume
,
with
that
self
-
control
which
seem
habitual
to
lady
of
Miss
Matty
's
standing
in
Cranford
,
who
would
have
think
their
dignity
compromise
by
the
slight
expression
of
surprise
,
dismay
,
or
any
similar
feeling
to
an
inferior
in
station
,
or
in
a
public
shop
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
walk
home
very
silently
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
ashamed
to
say
,
I
believe
I
be
rather
vexed
and
annoy
at
Miss
Matty
's
conduct
in
take
the
note
to
herself
so
decidedly
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
so
set
my
heart
upon
her
have
a
new
silk
gown
,
which
she
want
sadly
;
in
general
she
be
so
undecided
anybody
may
turn
her
round
;
in
this
case
I
have
feel
that
it
be
no
use
attempt
it
,
but
I
be
not
the
less
put
out
at
the
result
.
  
<EOS>
somehow
,
after
twelve
o'clock
,
we
both
acknowledge
to
a
sated
curiosity
about
the
fashion
,
and
to
a
certain
fatigue
of
body
(
which
be
,
in
fact
,
depression
of
mind
)
<EOS>
that
indispose
us
to
go
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
we
never
speak
of
the
note
;
till
,
all
at
once
,
something
possess
me
to
ask
Miss
Matty
if
she
would
think
it
her
duty
to
offer
sovereign
for
all
the
note
of
the
Town
and
County
Bank
<EOS>
she
meet
with
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
bite
my
tongue
out
the
minute
I
have
say
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
up
rather
sadly
,
and
as
if
I
have
throw
a
new
perplexity
into
her
already
distressed
mind
;
and
for
a
minute
or
two
she
do
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
say
 
<EOS>
my
own
dear
Miss
Matty
 
<EOS>
without
a
shade
of
reproach
in
her
voice
     
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
never
feel
as
if
my
mind
be
what
people
call
very
strong
;
and
it
be
often
hard
enough
work
for
me
to
settle
what
I
ought
to
do
with
the
case
right
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
thankful
to
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
thankful
,
that
I
see
my
duty
this
morning
,
with
the
poor
man
stand
by
me
;
but
its
rather
a
strain
upon
me
to
keep
think
and
think
what
I
should
do
if
such
and
such
a
thing
happen
;
and
,
<EOS>
I
believe
,
I
have
rather
wait
and
see
what
really
do
come
;
and
I
do
not
doubt
I
shall
be
help
then
if
I
do
not
fidget
myself
,
and
get
too
anxious
beforehand
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
love
,
I
be
not
like
Deborah
.
 
<EOS>
if
Deborah
have
live
,
I
have
no
doubt
she
would
have
see
after
them
,
before
they
have
get
themselves
into
this
state
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
have
neither
of
us
much
appetite
for
dinner
,
though
we
try
to
talk
cheerfully
about
indifferent
thing
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
return
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
Miss
Matty
unlock
her
desk
and
begin
to
look
over
her
account
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
penitent
for
what
I
have
say
in
the
morning
,
that
I
do
not
choose
to
take
upon
myself
the
presumption
to
suppose
that
I
could
assist
her
;
I
rather
leave
her
alone
,
as
,
with
puzzle
brow
,
her
eye
follow
her
pen
up
and
down
the
rule
page
.
 
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
she
shut
the
book
,
lock
the
desk
,
and
come
and
draw
a
chair
to
mine
,
where
I
sit
in
moody
sorrow
over
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
I
steal
my
hand
into
hers
;
she
clasp
it
,
but
do
not
speak
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
say
,
with
force
composure
in
her
voice
,
"
if
that
bank
go
wrong
,
I
shall
lose
one
hundred
and
forty
-
nine
pound
thirteen
shilling
and
fourpence
a
year
;
I
shall
only
have
thirteen
pound
a
year
leave
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
squeeze
her
hand
hard
and
tight
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
presently
(
it
be
too
dark
to
see
her
face
)
<EOS>
I
feel
her
finger
work
convulsively
in
my
grasp
;
and
I
know
she
be
go
to
speak
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
sobs
in
her
voice
as
she
say
,
"
I
hope
it
be
not
wrong
 
not
wicked
 
but
,
oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
glad
<EOS>
poor
Deborah
be
spare
this
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
bear
to
come
down
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
she
have
such
a
noble
,
lofty
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
she
say
about
the
sister
who
have
insist
upon
invest
their
little
property
in
that
unlucky
bank
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
later
in
light
the
candle
than
usual
that
night
,
and
until
that
light
shame
us
into
speak
,
we
sit
together
very
silently
and
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
we
take
to
our
work
after
tea
with
a
kind
of
force
cheerfulness
(
which
soon
become
real
as
far
as
it
go
)
,
talk
of
that
never
-
end
wonder
,
Lady
Glenmire
's
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
be
almost
come
round
to
think
it
a
good
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
deny
that
man
be
troublesome
in
a
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
judge
from
my
own
experience
,
for
my
father
be
neatness
itself
,
and
wipe
his
shoe
on
come
in
as
carefully
as
any
woman
;
but
still
a
man
have
a
sort
of
knowledge
of
what
should
be
do
in
difficulty
,
that
it
be
very
pleasant
to
have
one
at
hand
ready
to
lean
upon
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Lady
Glenmire
,
instead
of
be
toss
about
,
and
wonder
where
she
be
to
settle
,
will
be
certain
of
a
home
among
pleasant
and
kind
people
,
such
as
our
good
Miss
Pole
and
Mrs
Forrester
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mr
Hoggins
be
really
a
very
personable
man
;
and
as
for
his
manner
,
why
,
if
they
be
not
very
polished
,
I
have
know
people
with
very
good
heart
and
very
clever
mind
too
,
who
be
not
what
some
people
reckon
refined
,
but
who
be
both
true
and
tender
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
fall
off
into
a
soft
reverie
about
Mr
Holbrook
,
and
I
do
not
interrupt
her
<EOS>
,
I
be
so
busy
mature
a
plan
I
have
have
in
my
mind
for
some
day
,
but
which
this
threaten
failure
of
the
bank
have
bring
to
a
crisis
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
,
after
Miss
Matty
go
to
bed
,
I
treacherously
light
the
candle
again
,
and
sit
down
in
the
drawing
-
room
to
compose
a
letter
to
the
Aga
Jenkyns
,
a
letter
which
should
affect
him
if
he
be
Peter
,
and
yet
seem
a
mere
statement
of
dry
fact
if
he
be
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
the
church
clock
peal
out
two
before
I
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
news
come
,
both
official
and
otherwise
,
that
the
Town
and
County
Bank
have
stop
payment
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
be
ruin

<EOS>
She
try
to
speak
quietly
to
me
;
but
when
she
come
to
the
actual
fact
that
she
would
have
but
about
five
shilling
a
week
to
live
upon
,
she
could
not
restrain
a
few
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not

for
myself

say
she

wipe
them
away

believe
I
be
cry
for
the
very
silly
thought
of
how
my
mother
would
grieve
if
she
could
know
;
she
always
care
for
us
so
much
more
than
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
but
many
a
poor
person
have
less
,
and
I
be
not
very
extravagant
,
and
,
thank
God
,
when
the
neck
of
mutton
,
and
Martha
's
wage
,
and
the
rent
be
pay
,
I
have
not
a
farthing
owe
.
<EOS>
Poor
Martha
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
will
be
sorry
to
leave
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
smile
at
me
through
her
tear
,
and
she
would
fain
have
have
me
see
only
the
smile
,
not
the
tear
.
   
<EOS>
friend
in
NEED
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
example
to
me
,
and
I
fancy
it
may
be
to
many
other
,
to
see
how
immediately
Miss
Matty
set
about
the
retrenchment
which
she
know
to
be
right
under
her
alter
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
while
she
go
down
to
speak
to
Martha
,
and
break
the
intelligence
to
her
,
I
steal
out
with
my
letter
to
the
Aga
Jenkyns
,
and
go
to
the
signor
's
lodging
to
obtain
the
exact
address
.
 
<EOS>
I
bind
the
signora
to
secrecy
;
and
indeed
her
military
manner
have
a
degree
of
shortness
and
reserve
in
them
which
make
her
always
say
as
little
as
possible
,
except
when
under
the
pressure
of
strong
excitement
.
<EOS>
moreover
(
which
make
my
secret
doubly
sure
)
,
the
signor
be
now
so
far
recover
as
to
be
look
forward
to
travel
and
conjure
again
in
the
space
of
a
few
day
,
when
he
,
his
wife
,
and
little
Phoebe
would
leave
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
find
him
look
over
a
great
black
and
red
placard
,
in
which
the
Signor
Brunoni
's
accomplishment
be
set
forth
,
and
to
which
only
the
name
of
the
town
where
he
would
next
display
them
be
want
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
wife
be
so
much
absorb
in
decide
where
the
red
letter
would
come
in
with
most
effect
<EOS>
(
it
may
have
be
the
Rubric
for
that
matter
)
,
that
it
be
some
time
before
I
could
get
my
question
ask
privately
,
and
not
before
I
have
give
several
decision
,
the
which
I
question
afterwards
with
equal
wisdom
of
sincerity
as
soon
as
the
signor
throw
in
his
doubt
and
reason
on
the
important
subject
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
get
the
address
,
<EOS>
spelt
by
sound
,
and
very
queer
<EOS>
it
look
.
 
<EOS>
I
drop
it
in
the
post
on
my
way
home
,
and
then
for
a
minute
I
stand
look
at
the
wooden
pane
with
a
gape
slit
which
divide
me
from
the
letter
but
a
moment
ago
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
go
from
me
like
life
,
never
to
be
recall
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
get
toss
about
on
the
sea
,
and
stain
with
sea
-
wave
perhaps
,
and
be
carry
among
palm
-
tree
,
and
scent
with
all
tropical
fragrance
;
the
little
piece
of
paper
,
but
an
hour
ago
so
familiar
and
commonplace
,
have
set
out
on
its
race
to
the
strange
wild
country
beyond
the
Ganges
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
afford
to
lose
much
time
on
this
speculation
.
 
<EOS>
I
hasten
home
,
that
Miss
Matty
may
not
miss
me
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
open
the
door
to
me
,
her
face
swollen
with
crying
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
see
me
she
burst
out
afresh
,
and
take
hold
of
my
arm
<EOS>
she
pull
me
in
,
and
bang
the
door
to
,
in
order
to
ask
me
if
indeed
it
be
all
true
that
Miss
Matty
have
be
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
leave
her
!
 
<EOS>
no
;
I
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
so
,
and
say
I
could
not
think
how
she
could
find
in
her
heart
to
give
me
warning
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
have
the
face
to
do
it
,
if
I
would
be
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
ha
'
be
just
as
good
for
nothing
as
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
's
Rosy
,
who
strike
for
wage
after
live
seven
year
and
a
half
in
one
place
.
<EOS>
I
say
I
be
not
one
to
go
and
serve
Mammon
at
that
rate
;
that
I
know
when
I
would
get
a
good
missus
,
if
she
do
not
know
when
she
would
get
a
good
servant
<EOS>
"
     
"
<EOS>
but
,
Martha
,
"
say
I
,
cut
in
while
she
wipe
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
,
"
but
Martha
"
me
,
"
she
reply
to
my
deprecatory
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
listen
to
reason
"
     
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
listen
to
reason
,
"
she
say
,
now
in
full
possession
of
her
voice
,
which
have
be
rather
choke
with
sob
.
 
<EOS>
"
Reason
always
mean
what
someone
else
have
get
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
think
what
I
have
get
to
say
be
good
enough
reason
;
but
reason
or
not
,
I
will
say
it
,
and
I
will
stick
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
money
in
the
Savings
Bank
,
and
I
have
a
good
stock
of
clothe
,
and
I
be
not
go
to
leave
Miss
Matty
.
<EOS>
no
,
not
if
she
give
me
warn
every
hour
in
the
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
arm
akimbo
,
as
much
as
to
say
she
defy
me
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
could
hardly
tell
how
to
begin
to
remonstrate
with
her
,
so
much
do
I
feel
that
Miss
Matty
,
in
her
increase
infirmity
,
need
the
attendance
of
this
kind
and
faithful
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
"
 
s
aid
I
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
thankful
you
begin
with
"
well
!
"
 
<EOS>
if
you
would
have
begin
with
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
as
you
do
afore
,
I
would
not
ha
'
listen
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
now
you
may
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
would
be
a
great
loss
to
Miss
Matty
,
Martha
<EOS>
"
     
"
I
tell
her
so
.
 
<EOS>
a
loss
she
would
never
cease
to
be
sorry
for
,
"
break
in
Martha
triumphantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
still
,
she
will
have
so
little
 
<EOS>
so
very
little
 
to
live
upon
<EOS>
,
that
I
do
not
see
just
now
how
she
could
find
you
food
 
<EOS>
she
will
even
be
press
for
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
,
Martha
,
because
I
feel
you
be
like
a
friend
to
dear
Miss
Matty
,
but
you
know
she
may
not
like
to
have
it
speak
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
apparently
this
be
even
a
blacker
view
of
the
subject
than
Miss
Matty
have
present
to
her
,
for
Martha
just
sit
down
on
the
first
chair
that
come
to
hand
,
and
cry
out
loud
(
we
have
be
stand
in
the
kitchen
)
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
she
put
her
apron
down
,
and
look
me
earnestly
in
the
face
,
ask
,
"
be
that
the
reason
Miss
Matty
would
not
order
a
pudding
to
-
day
?
 
<EOS>
She
say
she
have
no
great
fancy
for
sweet
thing
,
and
you
and
she
would
just
have
a
mutton
chop
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
be
up
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
never
you
tell
,
but
I
will
make
her
a
pudding
,
and
a
pudding
she
will
like
,
too
,
and
I
will
pay
for
it
myself
;
so
mind
you
see
she
eat
it
.
 
<EOS>
many
a
one
have
be
comfort
in
their
sorrow
by
see
a
good
dish
come
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
rather
glad
that
Martha
's
energy
have
take
the
immediate
and
practical
direction
of
pudding
-
making
,
for
it
stave
off
the
quarrelsome
discussion
as
to
<EOS>
whether
she
should
or
should
not
leave
Miss
Matty
's
service
.
 
<EOS>
She
begin
to
tie
on
a
clean
apron
,
and
otherwise
prepare
herself
for
go
to
the
shop
for
the
butter
,
egg
,
and
what
else
she
may
require
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
use
a
scrap
of
the
article
already
in
the
house
for
her
cookery
,
but
go
to
an
old
tea
-
pot
in
which
her
private
store
of
money
be
deposit
,
and
take
out
what
she
want
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
Miss
Matty
very
quiet
,
and
not
a
little
sad
;
but
by
-
and
-
by
she
try
to
smile
for
my
sake
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
settle
that
I
be
to
write
to
my
father
,
and
ask
him
to
come
over
and
hold
a
consultation
,
and
as
soon
as
this
letter
be
despatch
we
begin
to
talk
over
future
plan
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
's
idea
be
to
take
a
single
room
,
and
retain
as
much
of
her
furniture
as
would
be
necessary
to
fit
up
this
,
and
sell
the
rest
,
and
there
to
quietly
exist
upon
what
would
remain
after
pay
the
rent
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
be
more
ambitious
and
less
contented
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
all
the
thing
by
which
a
woman
,
past
middle
age
,
and
with
the
education
common
to
lady
fifty
year
ago
,
could
earn
or
add
to
a
living
without
materially
lose
caste
;
but
at
length
I
put
even
this
last
clause
on
one
side
,
and
wonder
what
in
the
world
Miss
Matty
could
do
.
  
<EOS>
teaching
be
,
of
course
,
the
first
thing
that
suggest
itself
.
 
<EOS>
if
Miss
Matty
could
teach
child
anything
,
it
would
throw
her
among
the
little
elf
in
whom
her
soul
delight
.
 
<EOS>
I
run
over
her
accomplishment
.
 
<EOS>
once
upon
a
time
I
have
hear
her
say
she
could
play
"
ah
!
<EOS>
vous
dirai
-
je
,
maman
?
<EOS>
"
on
the
piano
,
<EOS>
but
that
be
long
,
long
ago
;
that
faint
shadow
of
musical
acquirement
have
die
out
year
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
also
once
be
able
to
trace
out
pattern
very
nicely
for
muslin
embroidery
,
by
dint
of
place
a
piece
of
silver
paper
over
the
design
to
be
copy
,
and
hold
both
against
the
window
-
pane
while
she
mark
the
scollop
and
eyelet
-
hole
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
her
near
approach
to
the
accomplishment
of
drawing
,
and
I
do
not
think
it
would
go
very
far
.
 
<EOS>
then
again
,
as
to
the
branch
of
a
solid
english
education
 
fancy
work
and
the
use
of
the
globe
 
such
as
the
mistress
of
the
Ladies
'
Seminary
,
to
which
all
the
tradespeople
in
Cranford
send
their
daughter
,
profess
to
teach
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
's
eye
be
fail
her
,
and
I
doubt
if
she
could
discover
the
number
of
thread
in
a
worst
-
work
pattern
,
or
rightly
appreciate
the
different
shade
require
for
Queen
Adelaide
's
face
in
the
loyal
wool
-
work
now
fashionable
in
Cranford
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
use
of
the
globes
,
I
have
never
be
able
to
find
it
out
myself
,
so
perhaps
I
be
not
a
good
judge
of
Miss
Matty
's
capability
of
instructing
in
this
branch
of
education
;
but
it
strike
me
that
equator
and
tropic
,
and
such
mystical
circle
,
be
very
imaginary
line
indeed
to
her
,
and
that
she
look
upon
the
sign
of
the
Zodiac
as
so
many
remnant
of
the
Black
Art
.
  
<EOS>
what
she
pique
herself
upon
,
as
art
in
which
she
excel
,
be
make
candle
-
lighter
,
or
"
spill
"
(
as
she
prefer
call
them
)
,
of
colour
paper
,
cut
so
as
to
resemble
feather
,
and
knit
garter
in
a
variety
of
dainty
stitch
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
once
say
,
on
receive
a
present
of
an
elaborate
pair
,
that
I
should
feel
quite
tempt
to
drop
one
of
them
in
the
street
,
in
order
to
have
it
admire
;
but
I
find
this
little
joke
(
and
it
be
a
very
little
one
)
be
such
a
distress
to
her
sense
of
propriety
,
and
be
take
with
such
anxious
,
earnest
alarm
,
lest
the
temptation
may
some
day
prove
too
strong
for
me
,
that
I
quite
regret
have
venture
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
present
of
these
delicately
-
work
garter
,
a
bunch
of
gay
"
spill
,
"
or
a
set
of
card
on
which
sewing
-
silk
be
wind
in
a
mystical
manner
,
be
the
well
-
know
token
of
Miss
Matty
's
favour
.
<EOS>
but
would
any
one
pay
to
have
their
child
teach
these
art
?
<EOS>
or
,
indeed
,
would
miss
Matty
sell
,
for
filthy
lucre
,
the
knack
and
the
skill
with
which
she
make
trifle
of
value
to
those
who
love
her
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
to
come
down
to
read
,
writing
,
and
arithmetic
;
and
,
in
read
the
chapter
every
morning
,
she
always
cough
before
come
to
long
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
her
power
of
get
through
a
genealogical
chapter
,
with
any
number
of
cough
.
 
<EOS>
Writing
<EOS>
she
do
well
and
delicately
 
but
spell
!
 
<EOS>
She
seem
to
think
that
the
more
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
this
be
,
and
the
more
trouble
it
cost
her
,
the
great
the
compliment
she
pay
to
her
correspondent
;
and
word
that
she
would
spell
quite
correctly
in
her
letter
to
me
become
perfect
enigmas
when
she
write
to
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
she
could
teach
to
the
rise
generation
of
Cranford
,
unless
they
have
be
quick
learner
and
ready
imitator
of
her
patience
,
her
humility
,
her
sweetness
,
her
quiet
contentment
with
all
that
she
could
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
ponder
and
ponder
until
dinner
be
announce
by
Martha
,
with
a
face
all
blubbered
and
swollen
with
cry
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
have
a
few
little
peculiarity
which
Martha
be
apt
to
regard
as
whim
below
her
attention
,
and
appear
to
consider
as
childish
fancy
of
which
an
old
lady
of
fifty
-
eight
should
try
and
cure
herself
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
-
day
everything
be
attend
to
with
the
most
careful
regard
.
 
<EOS>
the
bread
be
cut
to
the
imaginary
pattern
of
excellence
that
exist
in
Miss
Matty
's
mind
,
as
be
the
way
which
her
mother
have
prefer
,
the
curtain
be
draw
so
as
to
exclude
the
dead
brick
wall
of
a
neighbour
's
stable
,
and
yet
leave
so
as
to
show
every
tender
leaf
of
the
poplar
which
be
burst
into
spring
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
's
tone
to
Miss
Matty
be
just
such
as
that
good
,
rough
-
spoken
servant
usually
keep
sacred
for
little
child
,
and
which
I
have
never
hear
her
use
to
any
grow
-
up
person
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
forget
to
tell
Miss
Matty
about
the
pudding
,
and
I
be
afraid
she
may
not
do
justice
to
it
,
for
she
have
evidently
very
little
appetite
this
day
;
so
I
seize
the
opportunity
of
let
her
into
the
secret
while
Martha
take
away
the
meat
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
's
eye
fill
with
tear
,
and
she
could
not
speak
,
either
to
express
surprise
or
delight
,
when
Martha
return
bear
it
aloft
,
make
in
the
most
wonderful
representation
of
a
lion
couchant
that
ever
be
mould
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
's
face
gleam
with
triumph
as
she
set
it
down
before
Miss
Matty
with
an
exultant
"
there
!
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
want
to
speak
her
thank
,
but
could
not
;
so
she
take
Martha
's
hand
and
shake
it
warmly
,
which
set
Martha
off
cry
,
and
I
myself
could
hardly
keep
up
the
necessary
composure
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
burst
out
of
the
room
,
and
Miss
Matty
have
to
clear
her
voice
once
or
twice
before
she
could
speak
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
say
,
"
I
should
like
to
keep
this
pudding
under
a
glass
shade
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
notion
of
the
lion
couchant
,
with
his
currant
eye
,
be
hoist
up
to
the
place
of
honour
on
a
mantelpiece
,
tickle
my
hysterical
fancy
,
and
I
begin
to
laugh
,
which
rather
surprise
Miss
Matty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
dear
,
I
have
see
uglier
thing
under
a
glass
shade
before
now
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
so
have
I
,
many
a
time
and
oft
,
and
I
accordingly
compose
my
countenance
(
and
now
I
could
hardly
keep
from
cry
)
,
and
we
both
fall
to
upon
the
pudding
,
which
be
indeed
excellent
 
<EOS>
only
every
morsel
seem
to
choke
us
,
our
heart
be
so
full
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
too
much
to
think
about
to
talk
much
that
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
It
pass
over
very
tranquilly
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
the
tea
-
urn
be
bring
in
a
new
thought
come
into
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
not
miss
Matty
sell
tea
 
<EOS>
be
an
agent
to
the
East
India
Tea
Company
which
then
exist
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
see
no
objection
to
this
plan
,
while
the
advantage
be
many
 
always
suppose
that
Miss
Matty
could
get
over
the
degradation
of
condescend
to
anything
like
trade
.
 
<EOS>
Tea
be
neither
greasy
nor
sticky
 
<EOS>
grease
and
stickiness
be
two
of
the
quality
which
Miss
Matty
could
not
endure
.
 
<EOS>
no
shop
-
window
would
be
require
.
 
<EOS>
a
small
,
genteel
notification
of
her
be
license
to
sell
tea
<EOS>
would
,
it
be
true
,
be
necessary
,
but
I
hope
that
it
could
be
place
where
no
one
would
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be
tea
a
heavy
article
,
so
as
to
tax
Miss
Matty
's
fragile
strength
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
thing
against
my
plan
be
the
buying
and
selling
involve
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
give
but
absent
answer
to
the
question
Miss
Matty
be
put
 
almost
as
absently
 
we
hear
a
clumping
sound
on
the
stair
,
and
a
whispering
outside
the
door
,
which
indeed
once
open
and
shut
as
if
by
some
invisible
agency
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
little
while
Martha
come
in
,
drag
after
her
a
great
tall
young
man
,
all
crimson
with
shyness
,
and
find
his
only
relief
in
perpetually
sleek
down
his
hair
.
  
<EOS>
"
please
,
madam
,
he
be
only
Jem
Hearn
,
"
say
Martha
,
by
way
of
an
introduction
;
and
so
out
of
breath
be
she
that
I
imagine
she
have
have
some
bodily
struggle
before
she
could
overcome
his
reluctance
to
be
present
on
the
courtly
scene
of
Miss
Matilda
Jenkyns
's
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
please
,
madam
,
he
want
to
marry
me
off
-
hand
.
 
<EOS>
and
please
,
madam
,
we
want
to
take
a
lodger
 
just
one
quiet
lodger
,
to
make
our
two
end
meet
;
and
we
would
take
any
house
conformable
;
and
,
<EOS>
oh
dear
Miss
Matty
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
,
would
you
have
any
objection
to
lodge
with
us
?
 
<EOS>
Jem
want
it
as
much
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
[
to
Jem

<EOS>
"
You
great

<EOS>
why
can
not

very
bad

not

<EOS>
only

you

<EOS>
"
It
be
not

break
in
Jem

<EOS>
"
It
be
that
you
have
take
me
all
on
a
sudden
,
and
I
do
not
think
for
to
get
marry
so
soon
 
and
such
quick

flabbergast
a

<EOS>
It

not

I

<EOS>
(
address
Miss

,
"
only
Martha
have
such
quick
way
with
her

once
she
take

nail
a

over

"
please
,
madam

"
say
Martha
 
who
have
pluck
at
his
sleeve
,
and
nudge
him
with
her
elbow
,
and
otherwise
try
to
interrupt
him
all
the
time
he
have
be
speak
 
"
do
not

him

he
will
come
to

<EOS>
twas
<EOS>
only
last
night
he
be
an
-
axe
me
,
and
an
-
axe
me
,
and
all
the
more
because
I
say
I
could
not
think
of
it
for
year
to
come
,
and
now
he
be
only
take
aback
with
the
suddenness
of
the
joy
;
but
you
know
,
Jem
<EOS>
,
you
be
just
as
full
as
me
about
want
a
lodger
.
"
<EOS>
(
another
great
nudge
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
ay
!
<EOS>
if
Miss
Matty
would
lodge
with
us
 
<EOS>
otherwise
I
have
no
mind
to
be
cumber
with
strange
folk
in
the
house
,
"
say
Jem
,
with
a
want
of
tact
which
I
could
see
enrage
Martha
,
who
be
try
to
represent
a
lodger
as
the
great
object
they
wish
to
obtain
,
and
that
,
in
fact
,
Miss
Matty
would
be
smooth
their
path
and
confer
a
favour
,
if
she
would
only
come
and
live
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
herself
be
bewilder
by
the
pair
;
their
,
or
rather
Martha
's
sudden
resolution
in
favour
of
matrimony
stagger
her
,
and
stand
between
her
and
the
contemplation
of
the
plan
which
Martha
have
at
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
begin
     
"
marriage
be
a
very
solemn
thing
,
Martha
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
indeed
,
madam
,
"
quoth
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
that
I
have
no
objection
to
Martha
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
never
let
me
a
-
be
for
ask
me
for
to
fix
when
I
would
be
marry
,
"
say
Martha
 
her
face
all
a
-
fire
,
and
ready
to
cry
with
vexation
 
"
<EOS>
and
now
you
be
shame
me
before
my
missus
and
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
now
!
 
<EOS>
Martha
do
not
ee
!
<EOS>
do
not
ee
!
<EOS>
only
a
man
like
to
have
breathing
-
time
,
"
say
Jem
,
try
to
possess
himself
of
her
hand
,
but
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
then
see
that
she
be
more
seriously
hurt
than
he
have
imagine
,
he
seem
to
try
to
rally
his
scatter
faculty
,
and
with
more
straightforward
dignity
than
,
ten
minute
before
,
I
should
have
think
it
possible
for
him
to
assume
,
he
turn
to
Miss
Matty
,
and
say
,
"
I
hope
,
madam
,
you
know
that
I
be
bind
to
respect
every
one
who
have
be
kind
to
Martha
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
look
on
her
as
to
be
my
wife
 
<EOS>
some
time
;
and
she
have
often
and
often
spoken
of
you
as
the
kind
lady
that
ever
be
;
and
though
the
plain
truth
be
,
I
would
not
like
to
be
trouble
with
lodger
of
the
common
run
,
yet
if
,
madam
,
you
would
honour
us
by
live
with
us
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
Martha
would
do
her
good
to
make
you
comfortable
;
and
I
would
keep
out
of
your
way
as
much
as
I
could
,
which
I
reckon
would
be
the
good
kindness
<EOS>
such
an
awkward
chap
as
me
could
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
have
be
very
busy
with
take
off
her
spectacle
,
wipe
them
,
and
replace
them
;
but
all
she
could
say
be
,
"
do
not
let
any
thought
of
me
hurry
you
into
marriage
:
 
pray
do
not
.
<EOS>
marriage
be
such
a
very
solemn
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
Miss
Matilda
will
think
of
your
plan
,
Martha
,
"
say
I
,
strike
with
the
advantage
that
it
offer
,
and
unwilling
to
lose
the
opportunity
of
consider
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
sure
neither
she
nor
I
can
ever
forget
your
kindness
;
nor
your
be
either
,
Jem
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
yes
,
madam
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
mean
kindly
,
though
I
be
a
bit
fluttered
by
be
push
straight
ahead
into
matrimony
,
as
it
be
,
and
may
not
express
myself
conformable
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
sure
I
be
willing
enough
,
and
give
me
time
to
get
accustomed
;
so
,
Martha
,
<EOS>
wench
,
what
be
the
use
of
cry
so
,
and
slap
me
if
I
come
near
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
last
be
sotto
voce
,
and
have
the
effect
of
make
Martha
bounce
out
of
the
room
,
to
be
follow
and
soothe
by
her
lover
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
Miss
Matty
sit
down
and
cry
very
heartily
,
and
account
for
it
by
say
that
the
thought
of
Martha
be
marry
so
soon
give
her
quite
a
shock
,
and
that
she
should
never
forgive
herself
if
she
think
she
be
hurry
the
poor
creature
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
my
pity
be
more
for
Jem
,
of
the
two
;
but
both
Miss
Matty
and
I
appreciate
to
the
full
the
kindness
of
the
honest
couple
,
although
we
say
little
about
this
,
and
a
good
deal
about
the
chance
and
danger
of
matrimony
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
very
early
,
I
receive
a
note
from
Miss
Pole
,
so
mysteriously
wrap
up
,
and
with
so
many
seal
on
it
to
secure
secrecy
,
that
I
have
to
tear
the
paper
before
I
could
unfold
it
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
come
to
the
writing
I
could
hardly
understand
the
meaning
,
it
be
so
involved
and
oracular
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
out
,
however
,
that
I
be
to
go
to
Miss
Pole
's
at
eleven
o'clock
;
the
number
ELEVEN
be
write
in
full
length
as
well
as
in
numeral
,
and
<EOS>
A.M.
twice
dash
under
,
as
if
I
be
very
likely
to
come
at
eleven
at
night
,
when
all
Cranford
be
usually
a
-
bed
and
asleep
by
ten
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
signature
except
Miss
Pole
's
initial
reverse
,
P.E.
;
but
as
Martha
have
give
me
the
note
,
"
with
Miss
Pole
's
kind
regard
,
"
it
need
no
wizard
to
find
out
who
send
it
;
and
if
the
writer
's
name
be
to
be
keep
secret
,
it
be
very
well
that
I
be
alone
when
Martha
deliver
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
as
request
to
Miss
Pole
's
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
be
open
to
me
by
her
little
maid
Lizzy
in
Sunday
trim
,
as
if
some
grand
event
be
impend
over
this
work
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
drawing
-
room
upstairs
be
arrange
in
accordance
with
this
idea
.
 
<EOS>
the
table
be
set
out
with
the
good
green
card
-
cloth
,
and
write
material
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
little
chiffonier
be
a
tray
with
a
newly
-
decant
bottle
of
cowslip
wine
,
and
some
ladies'-finger
biscuit
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
herself
be
in
solemn
array
,
as
if
to
receive
visitor
,
although
it
be
only
eleven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
be
there
,
cry
quietly
and
sadly
,
and
my
arrival
seem
only
to
call
forth
fresh
tear
.
<EOS>
before
we
have
finish
our
greeting
,
perform
with
lugubrious
mystery
of
demeanour
,
there
be
another
rat
-
tat
-
tat
,
and
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
appear
,
crimson
with
walking
and
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
this
be
all
the
company
expect
;
for
now
Miss
Pole
make
several
demonstration
of
be
about
to
open
the
business
of
the
meeting
,
by
stir
the
fire
,
opening
and
shut
the
door
,
and
cough
and
blow
her
nose
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
arrange
us
all
round
the
table
,
take
care
to
place
me
opposite
to
her
;
and
last
of
all
,
she
inquire
of
me
if
the
sad
report
be
true
,
as
she
fear
it
be
,
that
Miss
Matty
have
lose
all
her
fortune
?
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
answer
to
make
;
and
<EOS>
I
never
see
more
unaffected
sorrow
depict
on
any
countenance
than
I
do
there
on
the
three
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
Mrs
Jamieson
be
here
!
"
say
Mrs
Forrester
at
last
;
but
to
judge
from
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
's
face
,
she
could
not
second
the
wish
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
without
Mrs
Jamieson
,
"
say
Miss
Pole
,
with
just
a
sound
of
offend
merit
in
her
voice
,
"
we
,
the
lady
of
Cranford
,
in
my
drawing
-
room
assemble
,
can
resolve
upon
something
.
 
<EOS>
I
imagine
we
be
none
of
us
what
may
be
call
rich
,
though
we
all
possess
a
genteel
competency
,
sufficient
for
taste
that
be
elegant
and
refined
,
and
would
not
,
if
they
could

be
vulgarly
ostentatious
.

<EOS>
(
here
I
observe
Miss
Pole
refer
to
a
small
card
conceal
in
her
hand

on

I
imagine
she
have
put
down
a
few
note

I
make
it
my
business
to
do
so
yesterday
afternoon
 
with
these
lady
on
the
misfortune
which
have
happen
to
our
friend
,
and
one
and
all
of
us
have
agree
that
while
we
have
a
superfluity
,
it
be
not
only
a
duty
,
but
a
pleasure
 
a
true
pleasure
,
Mary
!
"
 
<EOS>
her
voice
be
rather
choke
just
here
,
and
she
have
to
wipe
her
spectacle
before
she
could
go
on
 
"
to
give
what
we
can
to
assist
her
 
Miss
Matilda
Jenkyns
.
 
<EOS>
only
in
consideration
of
the
feeling
of
delicate
independence
exist
in
the
mind
of
every
refined
female
"
 
<EOS>
I
 
be
sure
she
have
get
back
to
the
card
now
 
<EOS>
"
we
wish
to
contribute
our
mite
in
a
secret
and
conceal
manner
,
so
as
not
to
hurt
the
feeling
I
have
refer
to
.
 
<EOS>
and
our
object
in
request
you
to
meet
us
this
morning
be
that
,
believe
you
be
the
daughter
 
that
your
father
be
,
in
fact
,
her
confidential
adviser
,
in
all
pecuniary
matter
,
we
imagine
that
,
by
consult
with
him
,
you
may
devise
some
mode
in
which
our
contribution
could
be
make
to
appear
the
legal
due
which
Miss
Matilda
Jenkyns
ought
to
receive
from
 
probably
your
father
,
know
her
investment
,
can
fill
up
the
blank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
conclude
her
address
,
and
look
round
for
approval
and
agreement
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
express
your
meaning
,
lady
,
have
I
not
?
 
<EOS>
and
while
Miss
Smith
consider
what
reply
to
make
,
allow
me
to
offer
you
some
little
refreshment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
great
reply
to
make
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
more
thankfulness
at
my
heart
for
their
kind
thought
than
I
care
to
put
into
word
;
and
so
I
only
mumble
out
something
to
the
effect
"
that
I
would
name
what
Miss
Pole
have
say
to
my
father
,
and
that
if
anything
could
be
arrange
for
dear
Miss
Matty
,
"
 
and
here
I
break
down
utterly
,
and
have
to
be
refresh
with
a
glass
of
cowslip
wine
before
I
could
check
the
crying
which
have
be
repress
for
the
last
two
or
three
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
bad
be
,
all
the
lady
cry
in
concert
.
 
<EOS>
even
Miss
Pole
cry
,
who
have
say
a
hundred
time
that
to
betray
emotion
before
any
one
be
a
sign
of
weakness
and
want
of
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
She
recover
herself
into
a
slight
degree
of
impatient
anger
,
direct
against
me
,
as
have
set
them
all
off
;
and
,
moreover
,
I
think
she
be
vex
that
I
could
not
make
a
speech
back
in
return
for
hers
;
and
if
I
have
know
beforehand
what
be
to
be
say
,
and
have
a
card
on
which
to
express
the
probable
feeling
that
would
rise
in
my
heart
,
I
would
have
try
to
gratify
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
Mrs
Forrester
be
the
person
to
speak
when
we
have
recover
our
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mind
,
among
friend
,
state
that
I
 
no
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
poor
exactly
,
but
I
do
not
think
I
be
what
you
may
call
rich
<EOS>
;
I
wish
I
be
,
for
dear
Miss
Matty
's
sake
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
please
,
I
will
write
down
in
a
seal
paper
what
I
can
give
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
wish
it
be
more
;
my
dear
Mary
,
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
I
see
why
paper
,
pen
,
and
ink
be
provide
.
 
<EOS>
every
lady
write
down
the
sum
she
could
give
annually
,
sign
the
paper
,
and
seal
it
mysteriously
.
 
<EOS>
if
their
proposal
be
accede
to
,
my
father
be
to
be
allow
to
open
the
paper
,
under
pledge
of
secrecy
.
 
<EOS>
if
not
,
they
be
to
be
return
to
their
writer
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
ceremony
have
be
go
through
,
I
rise
to
depart
;
but
each
lady
seem
to
wish
to
have
a
private
conference
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
keep
me
in
the
drawing
-
room
to
explain
why
,
in
Mrs
Jamieson
's
absence
,
she
have
take
the
lead
in
this
"
movement
,
"
as
she
be
pleased
to
call
it
,
and
also
to
inform
me
that
she
have
hear
from
good
source
that
Mrs
Jamieson
be
come
home
directly
in
a
state
of
high
displeasure
against
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
who
be
forthwith
to
leave
her
house
,
and
be
,
she
believe
,
to
return
to
Edinburgh
that
very
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
this
piece
of
intelligence
could
not
be
communicate
before
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
,
more
especially
as
Miss
Pole
be
incline
to
think
that
Lady
Glenmire
's
engagement
to
Mr
Hoggins
could
not
possibly
hold
against
the
blaze
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
hearty
inquiry
after
Miss
Matty
's
health
conclude
my
interview
with
Miss
Pole
.
  
<EOS>
on
come
downstairs
I
find
Mrs
Forrester
wait
for
me
at
the
entrance
to
the
dining
-
parlour
;
she
draw
me
in
,
and
when
the
door
be
shut
,
she
try
two
or
three
time
to
begin
on
some
subject
,
which
be
so
unapproachable
apparently
,
that
I
begin
to
despair
of
our
ever
get
to
a
clear
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
out
it
come
;
the
poor
old
lady
tremble
all
the
time
as
if
it
be
a
great
crime
which
she
be
expose
to
daylight
,
in
tell
me
how
very
,
very
little
she
have
to
live
upon
;
a
confession
which
she
be
bring
to
make
from
a
dread
lest
we
should
think
that
the
small
contribution
name
in
her
paper
bear
any
proportion
to
her
love
and
regard
for
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
that
sum
which
she
so
eagerly
relinquish
be
,
in
truth
,
<EOS>
more
than
a
twentieth
part
of
what
she
have
to
live
upon
,
and
keep
house
,
and
a
little
serving
-
maid
,
all
as
become
one
bear
a
Tyrrell
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
the
whole
income
do
not
nearly
amount
to
a
hundred
pound
,
to
give
up
a
twentieth
of
it
will
necessitate
many
careful
economy
,
and
many
piece
of
self
-
denial
,
small
and
insignificant
in
the
world
's
account
,
but
bear
a
different
value
in
another
account
-
book
that
I
have
hear
of
.
<EOS>
She
do
so
wish
she
be
rich
,
she
say
,
and
this
wish
she
keep
repeat
,
with
no
thought
of
herself
in
it
,
only
with
a
longing
,
yearning
desire
to
be
able
to
heap
up
Miss
Matty
's
measure
of
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
before
I
could
console
her
enough
to
leave
her
;
and
then
,
on
quit
the
house
,
I
be
waylay
by
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
,
who
have
also
her
confidence
to
make
of
pretty
nearly
the
opposite
description
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
like
to
put
down
all
that
she
could
afford
and
be
ready
to
give
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
she
think
she
never
could
look
Miss
Matty
in
the
face
again
if
she
presume
to
be
give
her
so
much
as
she
should
like
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Matty
!
<EOS>
"
continue
she
,
"
that
I
think
be
such
a
fine
young
lady
when
I
be
nothing
but
a
country
girl
,
come
to
market
with
egg
and
butter
and
such
like
thing
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
father
,
though
well
-
to
-
do
,
would
always
make
me
go
on
as
my
mother
have
do
before
me
,
and
I
have
to
come
into
Cranford
every
Saturday
,
and
see
after
sale
,
and
price
,
and
what
not
.
 
<EOS>
and
one
day
,
I
remember
,
I
meet
Miss
Matty
in
the
lane
that
lead
to
Combehurst
;
she
be
walk
on
the
footpath
,
which
,
you
know
,
be
raise
a
good
way
above
the
road
,
and
a
gentleman
ride
beside
her
,
and
be
talk
to
her
,
and
she
be
look
down
at
some
primrose
she
have
gather
,
and
pull
them
all
to
piece
,
and
I
do
believe
she
be
cry
.
 
<EOS>
but
after
she
have
pass
,
she
turn
round
and
run
after
me
to
ask
 
oh
,
so
kindly
 
about
my
poor
mother
,
who
lie
on
her
death
-
bed
;
and
when
I
cry
she
take
hold
of
my
hand
to
comfort
me
 
and
the
gentleman
wait
for
her
all
the
time
 
and
her
poor
heart
very
full
of
something
,
I
be
sure
;
and
I
think
it
such
an
honour
to
be
speak
to
in
that
pretty
way
by
the
rector
's
daughter
,
who
visit
at
Arley
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
love
her
ever
since
,
though
perhaps
I
would
no
right
to
do
it
;
but
if
you
can
think
of
any
way
in
which
I
may
be
allow
to
give
a
little
more
without
any
one
know
it
,
I
should
be
so
much
oblige
to
you
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
and
my
brother
would
be
delighted
to
doctor
her
for
nothing
 
medicine
,
leech
,
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
he
and
her
ladyship
(
my
dear
,
I
little
think
in
the
day
<EOS>
I
be
tell
you
of
that
I
should
ever
come
to
be
sister
-
in
-
law
to
a
ladyship
!
)
<EOS>
would
do
anything
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
be
quite
sure
of
it
,
and
promise
all
sort
of
thing
in
my
anxiety
to
get
home
to
Miss
Matty
,
who
may
well
be
wonder
what
have
become
of
me
 
absent
from
her
two
hour
without
be
able
to
account
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
take
very
little
note
of
time
,
however
,
as
she
have
be
occupy
in
numberless
little
arrangement
preparatory
to
the
great
step
of
give
up
her
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
evidently
a
relief
to
her
to
be
do
something
in
the
way
of
retrenchment
,
for
,
as
she
say
,
whenever
she
pause
to
think
,
the
recollection
of
the
poor
fellow
with
his
bad
five
-
pound
note
come
over
her
,
and
she
feel
quite
dishonest
;
only
if
it
make
her
so
uncomfortable
,
what
must
it
not
be
do
to
the
director
of
the
bank
,
who
must
know
so
much
more
of
the
misery
consequent
upon
this
failure
?
 
<EOS>
She
almost
make
me
angry
by
divide
her
sympathy
between
these
director
(
whom
she
imagine
overwhelmed
by
self
-
reproach
for
the
mismanagement
of
other
people
's
affair
)
and
those
who
be
suffer
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
of
the
two
,
she
seem
to
think
poverty
a
light
burden
than
self
-
reproach
;
but
I
privately
doubt
if
the
director
would
agree
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
old
hoard
be
take
out
and
examine
as
to
their
money
value
which
luckily
be
small
,
or
else
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
Miss
Matty
would
have
prevail
upon
herself
to
part
with
such
thing
as
her
mother
's
wedding
-
ring
,
the
strange
,
uncouth
brooch
with
which
her
father
have
disfigure
his
shirt
-
frill
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
however
,
we
arrange
thing
a
little
in
order
as
to
their
pecuniary
estimation
,
and
be
all
ready
for
my
father
when
he
come
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
weary
you
with
the
detail
of
all
the
business
we
go
through
;
and
one
reason
for
not
tell
about
them
be
,
that
I
do
not
understand
what
we
be
do
at
the
time
,
and
can
not
recollect
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
and
I
sit
assent
to
account
,
and
scheme
,
and
report
,
and
document
,
of
which
I
do
not
believe
we
either
of
us
understand
a
word
;
for
my
father
be
clear
-
headed
and
decisive
,
and
a
capital
man
of
business
,
and
if
we
make
the
slight
inquiry
,
or
express
the
slight
want
of
comprehension
,
he
have
a
sharp
way
of
say
,
"
eh
?
<EOS>
eh
?
<EOS>
it
be
as
dear
as
daylight
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
your
objection
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
as
we
have
not
comprehend
anything
of
what
he
have
propose
,
we
find
it
rather
difficult
to
shape
our
objection
;
in
fact
,
we
never
be
sure
if
we
have
any
.
 
<EOS>
so
presently
Miss
Matty
get
into
a
nervously
acquiescent
state
,
and
say
"
yes
,
"
and
"
<EOS>
certainly
,
"
at
every
pause
,
whether
require
or
not
;
but
when
I
once
join
in
as
chorus
to
a
"
decidedly
,
"
pronounce
by
Miss
Matty
in
a
tremblingly
dubious
tone
,
my
father
fire
round
at
me
and
ask
me
"
what
there
be
to
decide
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
to
this
day
I
have
never
know
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
justice
to
him
,
I
must
say
he
have
come
over
from
drumble
to
help
Miss
Matty
when
he
could
ill
spare
the
time
,
and
when
his
own
affair
be
in
a
very
anxious
state
.
  
<EOS>
while
Miss
Matty
be
out
of
the
room
give
order
for
luncheon
 
and
sadly
perplex
between
her
desire
of
honour
my
father
by
a
delicate
,
dainty
meal
,
and
her
conviction
that
she
have
no
right
,
now
that
all
her
money
be
go
,
to
indulge
this
desire
 
I
tell
him
of
the
meeting
of
the
Cranford
lady
at
Miss
Pole
's
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
keep
brush
his
hand
before
his
eye
as
I
speak
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
go
back
to
Martha
's
offer
the
evening
before
,
of
receive
Miss
Matty
as
a
lodger
,
he
fairly
walk
away
from
me
to
the
window
,
and
begin
drum
with
his
finger
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
turn
abruptly
round
,
and
say
,
"
see
,
Mary
,
how
a
good
,
innocent
life
make
friend
all
around
.
 
<EOS>
confound
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
make
a
good
lesson
out
of
it
if
I
be
a
parson
;
but
,
as
it
be
,
I
can
not
get
a
tail
to
my
sentence
 
<EOS>
only
I
be
sure
you
feel
what
I
want
to
say
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
will
have
a
walk
after
lunch
and
talk
a
bit
more
about
these
plan
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
lunch
 
a
hot
savoury
mutton
-
chop
,
and
a
little
of
the
cold
loin
slice
and
fried
 
be
now
bring
in
.
 
<EOS>
every
morsel
of
this
last
dish
be
finish
,
to
Martha
's
great
gratification
.
 
<EOS>
then
my
father
bluntly
tell
Miss
Matty
he
want
to
talk
to
me
alone
,
and
that
he
would
stroll
out
and
see
some
of
the
old
place
,
and
then
I
could
tell
her
what
plan
we
think
desirable
.
 
<EOS>
just
before
we
go
out
,
she
call
me
back
and
say
,
"
remember
,
dear
<EOS>
,
I
be
the
only
one
left
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
there
be
no
one
to
be
hurt
by
what
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
willing
to
do
anything
that
be
right
and
honest
;
and
I
do
not
think
,
if
Deborah
know
where
she
be
,
she
will
care
so
very
much
if
I
be
not
genteel
;
because
,
you
see
,
she
will
know
all
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
only
let
me
see
what
I
can
do
,
and
pay
the
poor
people
as
far
as
I
be
able
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
give
her
a
hearty
kiss
,
and
run
after
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
the
result
of
our
conversation
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
if
all
party
be
agreeable
,
Martha
and
Jem
be
to
be
marry
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
,
and
they
be
to
live
on
in
Miss
Matty
's
present
abode
;
the
sum
which
the
Cranford
lady
have
agree
to
contribute
annually
be
sufficient
to
meet
the
great
part
of
the
rent
,
and
leave
Martha
free
to
appropriate
what
Miss
Matty
should
pay
for
her
lodging
to
any
little
extra
comfort
require
.
 
<EOS>
about
the
sale
,
my
father
be
dubious
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
the
old
rectory
furniture
,
however
carefully
use
and
reverently
treat
,
would
fetch
very
little
;
and
that
little
would
be
but
as
a
drop
in
the
sea
of
the
debt
of
the
Town
and
County
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
represent
how
Miss
Matty
's
tender
conscience
would
be
soothe
by
feel
that
she
have
do
what
she
could
,
he
give
way
;
especially
after
I
have
tell
him
the
five
-
pound
note
adventure
,
and
he
have
scold
me
well
for
allow
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
allude
to
my
idea
that
she
may
add
to
her
small
income
by
sell
tea
;
and
,
to
my
surprise
(
for
I
have
nearly
give
up
the
plan
)
,
my
father
grasp
at
it
with
all
the
energy
of
a
tradesman
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
reckon
his
chicken
before
they
be
hatch
,
for
he
immediately
run
up
the
profit
of
the
sale
that
she
could
effect
in
Cranford
to
more
than
twenty
pound
a
year
.
<EOS>
the
small
dining
-
parlour
be
to
be
convert
into
a
shop
,
without
any
of
its
degrading
characteristic
;
a
table
be
to
be
the
counter
;
one
window
be
to
be
retain
unaltered
,
and
the
other
change
into
a
glass
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
evidently
rise
in
his
estimation
for
have
make
this
bright
suggestion
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
hope
we
should
not
both
fall
in
Miss
Matty
's
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
patient
and
content
with
all
our
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
,
she
say
,
that
we
should
do
the
good
we
could
for
her
;
and
she
only
hope
,
only
stipulate
,
that
she
should
pay
every
farthing
that
she
could
be
say
to
owe
,
for
her
father
's
sake
,
who
have
be
so
respected
in
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
and
I
have
agree
to
say
as
little
as
possible
about
the
bank
,
indeed
never
to
mention
it
again
,
if
it
could
be
help
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
plan
be
evidently
a
little
perplexing
to
her
;
but
she
have
see
me
sufficiently
snub
in
the
morning
for
want
of
comprehension
to
venture
on
too
many
inquiry
now
;
and
all
pass
over
well
with
a
hope
on
her
part
that
no
one
would
be
hurry
into
marriage
on
her
account
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
the
proposal
that
she
should
sell
tea
,
I
could
see
it
be
rather
a
shock
to
her
;
not
on
account
of
any
personal
loss
of
gentility
involve
,
but
only
because
she
distrust
her
own
power
of
action
in
a
new
line
of
life
,
and
would
timidly
have
prefer
a
little
more
privation
to
any
exertion
for
which
she
fear
she
be
unfitted
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
when
she
see
my
father
be
bent
upon
it
,
she
sigh
,
and
say
she
would
try
;
and
if
she
do
not
do
well
,
of
course
she
may
give
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
one
good
thing
about
it
be
,
she
do
not
think
man
ever
buy
tea
;
and
it
be
of
man
<EOS>
particularly
she
be
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
such
sharp
loud
way
with
them
;
and
do
up
account
,
and
count
their
change
so
quickly
!
 
<EOS>
now
,
if
she
may
only
sell
comfit
to
child
,
she
be
sure
she
could
please
them
!
   
<EOS>
a
happy
return
 
<EOS>
before
I
leave
Miss
Matty
at
Cranford
everything
have
be
comfortably
arrange
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
even
Mrs
Jamieson
's
approval
of
her
sell
tea
have
be
gain
.
 
<EOS>
that
oracle
have
take
a
few
day
to
consider
whether
by
so
do
Miss
Matty
would
forfeit
her
right
to
the
privilege
of
society
in
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
have
some
little
idea
of
mortify
Lady
Glenmire
by
the
decision
she
give
at
last
;
<EOS>
which
be
to
this
effect
:
 
that
whereas
a
married
woman
take
her
husband
's
rank
by
the
strict
law
of
precedence
,
an
unmarried
woman
retain
the
station
her
father
occupy
.
 
<EOS>
so
Cranford
be
allow
to
visit
Miss
Matty
;
and
,
whether
allow
or
not
,
it
intend
to
visit
Lady
Glenmire
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
be
our
surprise
 
<EOS>
our
dismay
 
<EOS>
when
we
learn
that
Mr
and
MRS
hoggin
be
return
on
the
follow
Tuesday
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Hoggins
!
<EOS>
have
she
absolutely
drop
her
title
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
,
cut
the
aristocracy
to
become
a
Hoggins
!
 
<EOS>
She
,
who
may
have
be
call
Lady
Glenmire
to
her
die
day
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
be
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
it
only
convince
her
of
what
she
have
know
from
the
first
,
that
the
creature
have
a
low
taste
.
 
<EOS>
but
"
the
creature
"
look
very
happy
on
Sunday
at
church
;
nor
do
we
see
it
necessary
to
keep
our
veil
down
on
that
side
of
our
bonnet
on
which
Mr
and
Mrs
Hoggins
sit
,
as
Mrs
Jamieson
do
;
thereby
miss
all
the
smile
glory
of
his
face
,
and
all
the
become
blush
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
if
Martha
and
Jem
look
more
radiant
in
the
afternoon
,
when
they
,
too
,
make
their
first
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
soothe
the
turbulence
of
her
soul
by
have
the
blind
of
her
window
draw
down
,
as
if
for
a
funeral
,
on
the
day
when
Mr
and
Mrs
Hoggins
receive
caller
;
and
it
be
with
some
difficulty
that
she
be
prevail
upon
to
continue
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
,
<EOS>
so
indignant
be
she
with
its
have
insert
the
announcement
of
the
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
's
sale
go
off
famously
.
 
<EOS>
She
retain
the
furniture
of
her
sitting
-
room
and
bedroom
;
the
former
of
which
she
be
to
occupy
till
Martha
could
meet
with
a
lodger
who
may
wish
to
take
it
;
and
into
this
sit
-
room
and
bedroom
she
have
to
cram
all
sort
of
thing
,
which
be
(
the
auctioneer
assure
her
)
buy
in
for
her
at
the
sale
by
an
unknown
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
suspect
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
of
this
;
but
she
must
have
have
an
accessory
,
who
know
what
article
be
particularly
regard
by
Miss
Matty
on
account
of
their
association
with
her
early
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
house
look
rather
bare
,
to
be
sure
;
all
except
one
tiny
bedroom
,
of
which
my
father
allow
me
to
purchase
the
furniture
for
my
occasional
use
in
case
of
Miss
Matty
's
illness
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
expend
my
own
small
store
in
buy
all
manner
of
comfit
and
lozenge
,
in
order
to
tempt
the
little
people
whom
Miss
Matty
love
so
much
to
come
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
tea
in
bright
green
canister
,
and
comfit
in
tumbler
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
<EOS>
and
I
feel
quite
proud
as
we
look
round
us
on
the
evening
before
the
shop
be
to
be
open
.
<EOS>
Martha
have
scour
the
board
floor
to
a
white
cleanness
,
and
it
be
adorn
with
a
brilliant
piece
of
oil
-
cloth
,
on
which
customer
be
to
stand
before
the
table
-
counter
.
 
<EOS>
the
wholesome
smell
of
plaster
and
whitewash
pervade
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
small
"
Matilda
Jenkyns
,
license
to
sell
tea
,
"
be
hide
under
the
lintel
of
the
new
door
,
and
two
box
of
tea
,
with
cabalistic
inscription
all
over
them
,
stand
ready
to
disgorge
their
content
into
the
canister
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
,
as
I
ought
to
have
mention
before
,
have
have
some
scruple
of
conscience
at
sell
tea
when
there
be
already
Mr
Johnson
in
the
town
,
who
include
it
among
his
numerous
commodity
;
and
,
before
she
could
quite
reconcile
herself
to
the
adoption
of
her
new
business
,
she
have
trot
down
to
his
shop
,
unknown
to
me
,
to
tell
him
of
the
project
that
be
entertain
,
and
to
inquire
if
it
be
likely
to
injure
his
business
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
call
this
idea
of
hers
"
great
nonsense
,
"
and
"
wonder
how
tradespeople
be
to
get
on
if
there
be
to
be
a
continual
consulting
of
each
other
's
interest
,
which
would
put
a
stop
to
all
competition
directly
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
,
perhaps
,
it
would
not
have
do
in
Drumble
,
but
in
Cranford
it
answer
very
well
;
for
not
only
do
Mr
Johnson
kindly
put
at
rest
all
Miss
Matty
's
scruple
and
fear
of
injure
his
business
,
but
I
have
reason
to
know
he
repeatedly
send
customer
to
her
,
say
that
the
tea
he
keep
be
of
a
common
kind
,
but
that
Miss
Jenkyns
have
all
the
choice
sort
.
 
<EOS>
and
expensive
tea
be
a
very
favourite
luxury
with
well
-
to
-
do
tradespeople
and
rich
farmer
'
wife
,
who
turn
up
their
nose
at
the
Congou
and
Souchong
prevalent
at
many
table
of
gentility
,
and
will
have
nothing
else
than
Gunpowder
and
Pekoe
for
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
really
very
pleasant
to
see
how
her
unselfishness
and
simple
sense
of
justice
call
out
the
same
good
quality
in
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
seem
to
think
any
one
would
impose
upon
her
,
because
she
should
be
so
grieve
to
do
it
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
her
put
a
stop
to
the
asseveration
of
the
man
who
bring
her
coal
by
quietly
say
,
"
I
be
sure
you
would
be
sorry
to
bring
me
wrong
weight
;
"
and
if
the
coal
be
short
measure
that
time
,
I
do
not
believe
they
ever
be
again
.
 
<EOS>
People
would
have
feel
as
much
ashamed
of
presume
on
her
good
faith
as
they
would
have
do
on
that
of
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
father
say
"
such
simplicity
may
be
very
well
in
Cranford
,
but
would
never
do
in
the
world
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
I
fancy
the
world
must
be
very
bad
,
for
with
all
my
father
's
suspicion
of
every
one
with
whom
he
have
dealing
,
and
<EOS>
in
spite
of
all
his
many
precaution
,
he
lose
upwards
of
a
thousand
pound
by
roguery
only
last
year
.
  
<EOS>
I
just
stay
long
enough
to
establish
Miss
Matty
in
her
new
mode
of
life
,
and
to
pack
up
the
library
,
which
the
rector
have
purchase
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
write
a
very
kind
letter
to
Miss
Matty
,
say
"
how
glad
he
should
be
to
take
a
library
,
so
well
select
as
he
know
that
the
late
Mr
Jenkyns
's
must
have
be
,
at
any
valuation
put
upon
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
when
she
agree
to
this
,
with
a
touch
of
sorrowful
gladness
that
they
would
go
back
to
the
rectory
and
be
arrange
on
the
accustomed
wall
once
more
,
he
send
word
that
he
fear
that
he
have
not
room
for
them
all
,
and
perhaps
Miss
Matty
would
kindly
allow
him
to
leave
some
volume
on
her
shelf
.
 
<EOS>
but
Miss
Matty
say
that
she
have
her
Bible
and
"
Johnson
's
Dictionary
,
"
and
should
not
have
much
time
for
reading
,
she
be
afraid
;
still
,
I
retain
a
few
book
out
of
consideration
for
the
rector
's
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
the
money
which
he
have
pay
,
and
that
produce
by
the
sale
,
be
partly
expend
in
the
stock
of
tea
,
and
part
of
it
be
invest
against
a
rainy
day
 
i.e.
old
age
or
illness
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
<EOS>
a
small
sum
,
it
be
true
;
and
it
occasion
a
few
evasion
of
truth
and
white
lie
(
all
of
which
I
think
very
wrong
indeed
 
in
theory
 
and
would
rather
not
put
them
in
practice
)
,
for
we
know
Miss
Matty
would
be
perplex
as
to
her
duty
if
she
be
aware
of
any
little
reserve
 
fund
be
make
for
her
while
the
debt
of
the
bank
remain
unpaid
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
she
have
never
be
tell
of
the
way
in
which
her
friend
be
contribute
to
pay
the
rent
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
like
to
tell
her
this
,
but
the
mystery
of
the
affair
give
a
piquancy
to
their
deed
of
kindness
which
the
lady
be
unwilling
to
give
up
;
and
at
first
Martha
have
to
shirk
many
a
perplex
question
as
to
her
way
and
mean
of
live
in
such
a
house
,
but
by
-
and
-
by
Miss
Matty
's
prudent
uneasiness
sink
down
into
acquiescence
with
the
exist
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
Miss
Matty
with
a
good
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sale
of
tea
during
the
first
two
day
have
surpass
my
most
sanguine
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
country
round
seem
to
be
all
out
of
tea
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
alteration
I
could
have
desire
in
Miss
Matty
's
way
of
do
business
be
,
that
she
should
not
have
so
plaintively
entreat
some
of
her
customer
not
to
buy
green
tea
 
<EOS>
run
it
down
as
a
slow
poison
,
sure
to
destroy
the
nerve
,
and
produce
all
manner
of
evil
.
 
<EOS>
Their
pertinacity
in
take
it
,
in
spite
of
all
her
warning
,
distress
her
so
much
that
I
really
think
she
would
relinquish
the
sale
of
it
,
and
so
lose
half
her
custom
;
and
I
be
drive
to
my
wit
'
end
for
instance
of
longevity
entirely
attributable
to
a
persevere
use
of
green
tea
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
final
argument
,
which
settle
the
question
,
be
a
happy
reference
of
mine
to
the
train
-
oil
and
tallow
candle
which
the
Esquimaux
not
only
enjoy
but
digest
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
she
acknowledge
that
"
one
man
's
meat
may
be
another
man
's
poison
,
"
and
content
herself
thence
-
forward
with
an
occasional
remonstrance
when
she
think
the
purchaser
be
too
young
and
innocent
to
be
acquaint
with
the
evil
effect
green
tea
produce
on
some
constitution
,
and
an
habitual
sigh
when
people
old
enough
to
choose
more
wisely
would
prefer
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
over
from
drumble
once
a
quarter
at
least
to
settle
the
account
,
and
see
after
the
necessary
business
letter
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
speak
of
letter
,
I
begin
to
be
very
much
ashamed
of
remember
my
letter
to
the
Aga
Jenkyns
,
and
very
glad
I
have
never
name
my
writing
to
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
hope
the
letter
be
lose
.
 
<EOS>
no
answer
come
.
 
<EOS>
no
sign
be
make
.
  
<EOS>
about
a
year
after
Miss
Matty
set
up
shop
,
I
receive
one
of
Martha
's
hieroglyphic
,
beg
me
to
come
to
Cranford
very
soon
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
that
Miss
Matty
be
ill
,
and
go
off
that
very
afternoon
,
and
take
Martha
by
surprise
when
she
see
me
on
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
into
the
kitchen
as
usual
,
to
have
our
confidential
conference
,
and
then
Martha
tell
me
she
be
expect
her
confinement
very
soon
 
in
a
week
or
two
;
and
she
do
not
think
Miss
Matty
be
aware
of
it
,
and
she
want
me
to
break
the
news
to
her
,
"
for
indeed
,
miss
<EOS>
,
"
continue
Martha
,
cry
hysterically
,
"
I
be
afraid
she
will
not
approve
of
it
,
and
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
who
be
to
take
care
of
her
as
she
should
be
take
care
of
when
I
be
lay
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
comfort
Martha
by
tell
her
I
would
remain
till
she
be
about
again
,
and
only
wish
she
have
tell
me
her
reason
for
this
sudden
summon
,
as
then
I
would
have
bring
the
requisite
stock
of
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
but
Martha
be
so
tearful
and
tender
-
spirited
,
and
unlike
her
usual
self
,
that
I
say
as
little
as
possible
about
myself
,
and
endeavour
rather
to
comfort
Martha
under
all
the
probable
and
possible
misfortune
which
come
crowd
upon
her
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
steal
out
of
the
house
-
door
,
and
make
my
appearance
as
if
I
be
a
customer
in
the
shop
,
just
to
take
Miss
Matty
by
surprise
,
and
gain
an
idea
of
how
she
look
in
her
new
situation
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
warm
May
weather
,
so
only
the
little
half
-
door
be
close
;
and
Miss
Matty
sit
behind
the
counter
,
knit
an
elaborate
pair
of
garter
;
elaborate
they
seem
to
me
,
but
the
difficult
stitch
be
no
weight
upon
her
mind
,
for
she
be
singe
in
a
low
voice
to
herself
as
her
needle
go
rapidly
in
and
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
it
singe
,
but
I
dare
say
a
musician
would
not
use
that
word
to
the
tuneless
yet
sweet
humming
of
the
low
worn
voice
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
out
from
the
word
,
far
more
than
from
the
attempt
at
the
tune
,
that
it
be
the
Old
Hundredth
she
be
croon
to
herself
;
but
the
quiet
continuous
sound
tell
of
content
,
and
give
me
a
pleasant
feeling
,
as
I
stand
in
the
street
just
outside
the
door
,
quite
in
harmony
with
that
soft
May
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
in
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
she
do
not
catch
who
it
be
,
and
stand
up
as
if
to
serve
me
;
but
in
another
minute
watchful
pussy
have
clutch
her
knitting
,
which
be
drop
in
eager
joy
at
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
,
after
we
have
have
a
little
conversation
,
that
it
be
as
Martha
say
,
and
that
Miss
Matty
have
no
idea
of
the
approach
household
event
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
think
I
would
let
thing
take
their
course
,
<EOS>
secure
that
when
I
go
to
her
with
the
baby
in
my
arm
,
I
should
obtain
that
forgiveness
for
Martha
which
she
be
needlessly
frighten
herself
into
believe
that
Miss
Matty
would
withhold
,
under
some
notion
that
the
new
claimant
would
require
attention
from
its
mother
that
it
would
be
faithless
treason
to
Miss
Matty
to
render
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
must
be
an
hereditary
quality
,
for
my
father
say
he
be
scarcely
ever
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
one
morning
,
within
a
week
after
I
arrive
,
I
go
to
call
Miss
Matty
,
with
a
little
bundle
of
flannel
in
my
arm
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
much
awe
-
strike
when
I
show
her
what
it
be
,
and
ask
for
her
spectacle
off
the
dressing
-
table
,
and
look
at
it
curiously
,
with
a
sort
of
tender
wonder
at
its
small
perfection
of
part
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
banish
the
thought
of
the
surprise
all
day
,
but
go
about
on
tiptoe
,
and
be
very
silent
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
steal
up
to
see
Martha
<EOS>
and
they
both
cry
with
joy
,
and
she
get
into
a
complimentary
speech
to
Jem
,
and
do
not
know
how
to
get
out
of
it
again
,
and
be
only
extricate
from
her
dilemma
by
the
sound
of
the
shop
-
bell
,
which
be
an
equal
relief
to
the
shy
,
proud
,
honest
Jem
,
who
shake
my
hand
so
vigorously
when
I
congratulate
him
,
that
I
think
I
feel
the
pain
of
it
yet
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
busy
life
while
Martha
be
lay
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
attend
on
Miss
Matty
,
and
prepare
her
meal
;
I
cast
up
her
account
,
and
examine
into
the
state
of
her
canister
and
tumbler
.
 
<EOS>
I
help
her
,
too
,
occasionally
,
in
the
shop
;
and
it
give
me
no
small
amusement
,
and
sometimes
a
little
uneasiness
,
to
watch
her
way
there
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
little
child
come
in
to
ask
for
an
ounce
of
almond
-
comfits
(
and
four
of
the
large
kind
which
Miss
Matty
sell
weigh
that
much
)
,
she
always
add
one
more
by
"
way
of
make
-
weight
,
"
as
she
call
it
,
although
the
scale
be
handsomely
turn
before
;
and
when
I
remonstrate
against
this
,
her
reply
be
,
"
the
little
thing
like
it
so
much
!
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
use
in
tell
her
that
the
fifth
comfit
weigh
a
quarter
of
an
ounce
,
and
make
every
sale
into
a
loss
to
her
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
remember
the
green
tea
,
and
wing
my
shaft
with
a
feather
out
of
her
own
plumage
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
how
unwholesome
almond
-
comfit
be
,
and
how
ill
excess
in
them
may
make
the
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
this
argument
produce
some
effect
;
for
,
henceforward
,
instead
of
the
fifth
comfit
,
she
always
tell
them
to
hold
out
their
tiny
palm
,
into
which
she
shake
either
peppermint
or
ginger
lozenge
,
as
a
preventive
to
the
danger
that
may
arise
from
the
previous
sale
.
 
<EOS>
altogether
the
lozenge
trade
,
conduct
on
these
principle
,
do
not
promise
to
be
remunerative
;
but
I
be
happy
to
find
she
have
make
more
than
twenty
pound
during
the
last
year
by
her
sale
of
tea
;
and
,
moreover
,
that
now
she
be
accustomed
to
it
,
she
do
not
dislike
the
employment
,
which
bring
her
into
kindly
intercourse
with
many
of
the
people
round
about
.
<EOS>
if
she
give
them
good
weight
,
they
,
in
their
turn
,
bring
many
a
little
country
present
to
the
"
old
rector
's
daughter
"
;
a
cream
cheese
,
a
few
new
-
lay
egg
,
a
little
fresh
ripe
fruit
,
a
bunch
of
flower
.
 
<EOS>
the
counter
be
quite
load
with
these
offering
sometimes
,
as
she
tell
me
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Cranford
in
general
,
it
be
go
on
much
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
the
Jamieson
and
Hoggins
feud
still
rage
,
if
a
feud
it
could
be
call
,
when
only
one
side
care
much
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Hoggins
be
very
happy
together
,
and
,
like
most
very
happy
people
,
quite
ready
to
be
friendly
;
indeed
,
Mrs
Hoggins
be
really
desirous
to
be
restore
to
Mrs
Jamieson
's
good
grace
,
because
of
the
former
intimacy
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mrs
Jamieson
consider
their
very
happiness
an
insult
to
the
Glenmire
family
,
to
which
she
have
still
the
honour
to
belong
,
and
she
doggedly
refuse
and
reject
every
advance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mulliner
,
like
a
faithful
clansman
,
espouse
his
mistress
'
side
with
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
see
either
Mr
or
Mrs
Hoggins
,
he
would
cross
the
street
,
and
appear
absorb
in
the
contemplation
of
life
in
general
,
and
his
own
path
in
particular
,
until
he
have
pass
them
by
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
use
to
amuse
herself
with
wonder
what
in
the
world
Mrs
Jamieson
would
do
,
if
either
she
,
or
Mr
Mulliner
,
or
any
other
member
of
her
household
be
take
ill
;
she
could
hardly
have
the
face
to
call
in
Mr
Hoggins
after
the
way
she
have
behave
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
grow
quite
impatient
for
some
indisposition
or
accident
to
befall
Mrs
Jamieson
or
her
dependent
,
in
order
that
Cranford
may
see
how
she
would
act
under
the
perplex
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
Martha
be
begin
to
go
about
again
,
and
I
have
already
fix
a
limit
,
not
very
far
distant
,
to
my
visit
,
when
one
afternoon
,
as
I
be
sit
in
the
shop
-
parlour
with
Miss
Matty
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
weather
be
cold
now
than
it
have
be
in
May
,
three
week
before
,
and
we
have
a
fire
and
keep
the
door
fully
close
 
<EOS>
we
see
a
gentleman
go
slowly
past
the
window
,
and
then
stand
opposite
to
the
door
,
as
if
look
out
for
the
name
which
we
have
so
carefully
hide
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
out
a
double
eyeglass
and
peer
about
for
some
time
before
he
could
discover
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
all
on
a
sudden
,
it
flash
across
me
that
it
be
the
Aga
himself
!
 
<EOS>
for
his
clothe
have
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
foreign
cut
about
them
,
and
his
face
be
deep
brown
,
as
if
tan
and
re
-
tan
by
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
His
complexion
contrast
oddly
with
his
plentiful
snow
-
white
hair
,
his
eye
be
dark
and
piercing
,
and
he
have
an
odd
way
of
contract
them
and
pucker
up
his
cheek
into
innumerable
wrinkle
when
he
look
earnestly
at
object
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
so
to
Miss
Matty
when
he
first
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
His
glance
have
first
catch
and
linger
a
little
upon
me
,
but
then
turn
,
with
the
peculiar
searching
look
I
have
describe
,
to
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
fluttered
and
nervous
,
but
no
more
so
than
she
always
be
when
any
man
come
into
her
shop
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
he
would
probably
have
a
note
,
or
a
sovereign
at
least
,
for
which
she
would
have
to
give
change
,
which
be
an
operation
she
very
much
dislike
to
perform
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
present
customer
stand
opposite
to
her
,
without
ask
for
anything
,
only
look
fixedly
at
her
as
he
drum
upon
the
table
with
his
finger
,
just
for
all
the
world
as
Miss
Jenkyns
use
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
be
on
the
point
of
ask
him
what
he
want
(
as
she
tell
me
afterwards
)
,
when
he
turn
sharp
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
be
your
name
Mary
Smith
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
!
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
all
my
doubt
as
to
his
identity
be
set
at
rest
,
and
I
only
wonder
what
he
would
say
or
do
next
,
and
how
Miss
Matty
would
stand
the
joyful
shock
of
what
he
have
to
reveal
.
 
<EOS>
apparently
he
be
at
a
loss
how
to
announce
himself
,
for
he
look
round
at
last
in
search
of
something
to
buy
,
so
as
to
gain
time
,
and
,
as
it
happen
,
his
eye
catch
on
the
almond
-
comfit
,
and
he
boldly
ask
for
a
pound
of
"
those
thing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
Miss
Matty
have
a
whole
pound
in
the
shop
,
and
,
besides
the
unusual
magnitude
of
the
order
,
she
be
distress
with
the
idea
of
the
indigestion
they
would
produce
,
take
in
such
unlimited
quantity
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
up
to
remonstrate
.
 
<EOS>
something
of
tender
relaxation
in
his
face
strike
home
to
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
"
It
be
 
oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
can
you
be
Peter
?
"
and
tremble
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
moment
he
be
round
the
table
and
have
her
in
his
arm
,
sob
the
tearless
cry
of
old
age
.
 
<EOS>
I
bring
her
a
glass
of
wine
,
for
indeed
her
colour
have
change
so
as
to
alarm
me
and
Mr
Peter
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
keep
say
,
"
I
have
be
too
sudden
for
you
,
Matty
 
<EOS>
I
have
,
my
little
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
propose
that
she
should
go
at
once
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
and
lie
down
on
the
sofa
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
wistfully
at
her
brother
,
whose
hand
she
have
hold
tight
,
even
when
nearly
faint
;
but
on
his
assuring
her
that
he
would
not
leave
her
,
she
allow
him
to
carry
her
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
that
the
good
I
could
do
be
to
run
and
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
for
early
tea
,
and
then
to
attend
to
the
shop
,
leave
the
brother
and
sister
to
exchange
some
of
the
many
thousand
thing
they
must
have
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
also
to
break
the
news
to
Martha
,
who
receive
it
with
a
burst
of
tear
which
nearly
infect
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
keep
recover
herself
to
ask
if
I
be
sure
it
be
indeed
Miss
Matty
's
brother
,
<EOS>
for
I
have
mention
that
he
have
grey
hair
,
and
she
have
always
hear
that
he
be
a
very
handsome
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
something
of
the
same
kind
perplex
Miss
Matty
at
tea
-
time
,
when
she
be
instal
in
the
great
easy
-
chair
opposite
to
Mr
Jenkyns
in
order
to
gaze
her
fill
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
drink
for
look
at
him
,
and
as
for
eat
,
that
be
out
of
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
hot
climate
age
people
very
quickly
,
"
say
she
,
almost
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
you
leave
Cranford
you
have
not
a
grey
hair
in
your
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
many
year
ago
be
that
?
"
say
Mr
Peter
,
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
true
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
suppose
you
and
I
be
get
old
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
I
do
not
think
we
be
so
very
old
!
 
<EOS>
but
white
hair
be
very
become
to
you
,
Peter
<EOS>
,
"
she
continue
 
a
little
afraid
lest
she
have
hurt
him
by
reveal
how
his
appearance
have
impress
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
forget
date
too
,
Matty
,
for
what
do
you
think
I
have
bring
for
you
from
India
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
indian
muslin
gown
and
a
pearl
necklace
for
you
somewhere
in
my
chest
at
Portsmouth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
smile
as
if
amuse
at
the
idea
of
the
incongruity
of
his
present
with
the
appearance
of
his
sister
;
but
this
do
not
strike
her
all
at
once
,
while
the
elegance
of
the
article
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
see
that
for
a
moment
her
imagination
dwell
complacently
on
the
idea
of
herself
thus
attire
;
and
instinctively
she
put
her
hand
up
to
her
throat
 
<EOS>
that
little
delicate
throat
which
(
as
Miss
Pole
have
tell
me
)
have
be
one
of
her
youthful
charm
;
but
the
hand
meet
the
touch
of
fold
of
soft
muslin
in
which
she
be
always
swathe
up
to
her
chin
,
and
the
sensation
recall
a
sense
of
the
unsuitableness
of
a
pearl
necklace
to
her
age
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
"
I
be
afraid
I
be
too
old
;
but
it
be
very
kind
of
you
to
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
just
what
I
should
have
like
year
ago
 
when
I
be
young
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
think
,
my
little
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
your
taste
;
they
be
so
like
my
dear
mother
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
the
mention
of
that
name
<EOS>
the
brother
and
sister
clasp
each
other
's
hand
yet
more
fondly
,
and
,
although
they
be
perfectly
silent
,
I
fancy
they
may
have
something
to
say
if
they
be
unchecked
by
my
presence
,
and
I
get
up
to
arrange
my
room
for
Mr
Peter
's
occupation
that
night
,
intend
myself
to
share
Miss
Matty
's
bed
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
my
movement
,
he
start
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
and
settle
about
a
room
at
the
"
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
carpet
-
bag
be
there
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
say
Miss
Matty
,
in
great
distress
 
"
you
must
not
go
;
please
,
dear
Peter
 
pray
,
Mary
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
must
not
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
so
much
agitate
that
we
both
promise
everything
she
wish
.
 
<EOS>
Peter
sit
down
again
and
give
her
his
hand
,
which
for
well
security
she
hold
in
both
of
her
,
and
I
leave
the
room
to
accomplish
my
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
long
,
long
into
the
night
,
far
,
far
into
the
morning
,
do
Miss
Matty
and
I
talk
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
much
to
tell
me
of
her
brother
's
life
and
adventure
,
which
he
have
communicate
to
her
as
they
have
sit
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
all
be
thoroughly
clear
to
her
;
but
I
never
quite
understand
the
whole
story
;
and
when
in
after
day
I
lose
my
awe
of
Mr
Peter
enough
to
question
him
myself
,
he
laugh
at
my
curiosity
,
and
tell
me
story
that
sound
so
very
much
like
Baron
Munchausen
's
,
that
I
be
sure
he
be
make
fun
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
hear
from
Miss
Matty
be
that
he
have
be
a
volunteer
at
the
siege
of
Rangoon
;
have
be
take
prisoner
by
the
Burmese
;
and
somehow
obtain
favour
and
eventual
freedom
from
know
how
to
bleed
the
chief
of
the
small
tribe
in
some
case
of
dangerous
illness
;
that
on
his
release
from
year
of
captivity
he
have
have
his
letter
return
from
England
with
the
ominous
word
"
dead
"
mark
upon
them
;
and
,
believe
himself
to
be
the
last
of
his
race
,
he
have
settle
down
as
an
indigo
planter
,
and
have
propose
to
spend
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
the
country
to
whose
inhabitant
and
mode
of
life
he
have
become
habituated
,
when
my
letter
have
reach
him
;
and
,
with
the
odd
vehemence
which
characterise
him
in
age
as
it
have
do
in
youth
,
he
have
sell
his
land
and
all
his
possession
to
the
first
purchaser
,
and
come
home
to
the
poor
old
sister
,
who
be
more
glad
and
rich
than
any
princess
when
she
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
talk
me
to
sleep
at
last
,
and
then
I
be
awaken
by
a
slight
sound
at
the
door
,
for
which
she
beg
my
pardon
as
she
creep
penitently
into
bed
;
but
it
seem
that
when
I
could
no
longer
confirm
her
belief
that
the
long
-
lost
be
really
here
 
under
the
same
roof
 
she
have
begin
to
fear
lest
it
be
only
a
wake
dream
of
her
;
that
there
never
have
be
a
Peter
sit
by
her
all
that
bless
evening
 
<EOS>
but
that
the
real
Peter
lie
dead
far
away
beneath
some
wild
sea
-
wave
,
or
under
some
strange
eastern
tree
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
strong
have
this
nervous
feeling
of
her
become
,
that
she
be
fain
to
get
up
and
go
and
convince
herself
that
he
be
really
there
by
listen
through
the
door
to
his
even
,
regular
breathing
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
call
it
snore
,
but
I
hear
it
myself
through
two
closed
door
 
and
by-
and
-
by
it
soothe
Miss
Matty
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
Mr
Peter
come
home
from
India
as
rich
as
a
nabob
;
he
even
consider
himself
poor
,
but
neither
he
nor
Miss
Matty
care
much
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
have
enough
to
live
upon
"
very
genteelly
"
at
Cranford
;
he
and
Miss
Matty
together
.
 
<EOS>
and
a
day
or
two
after
his
arrival
,
the
shop
be
close
,
while
troop
of
little
urchin
gleefully
await
the
shower
of
comfit
and
lozenge
that
come
from
time
to
time
down
upon
their
face
as
they
stand
up
-
gazing
at
Miss
Matty
's
drawing
-
room
window
.
 
<EOS>
Occasionally
Miss
Matty
would
say
to
them
(
half
-
hide
behind
the
curtain
)
,
"
My
dear
child
,
do
not
make
yourself
ill
;
"
but
a
strong
arm
pull
her
back
,
and
a
more
rattling
shower
than
ever
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
a
part
of
the
tea
be
send
in
present
to
the
Cranford
lady
;
and
some
of
it
be
distribute
among
the
old
people
who
remember
Mr
Peter
in
the
day
of
his
frolicsome
youth
.
 
<EOS>
the
indian
muslin
gown
be
reserve
for
darle
Flora
Gordon

(
Miss
Jessie

<EOS>
the
Gordons
have
be
on
the
Continent
for
the
last
few
year
,
but
be
now
expect
to
return
very
soon
;
and
Miss
Matty
,
in
her
sisterly
pride
,
anticipate
great
delight
in
the
joy
of
show
them
Mr
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
the
pearl

disappear
;
and
about
that
time
many
handsome
and
useful
present
make
their
appearance
in
the
household
of
Miss
Pole
and
Mrs
Forrester
;
and
some
rare
and
delicate
indian
ornament
grace
the
drawing

room
of
Mrs
Jamieson
and
Mrs
Fitz

Adam

<EOS>
I
myself
be
not
forget
.
 
<EOS>
among
other
thing
,
I
have
the
handsomest
-
bind
and
good
edition
of
Dr
Johnson
's
work
that
could
be
procure
;
and
dear
Miss
Matty
,
with
tear
in
her
eye
,
beg
me
to
consider
it
as
a
present
from
her
sister
as
well
as
herself
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
no
one
be
forget
;
and
,
what
be
more
,
every
one
,
however
insignificant
,
who
have
show
kindness
to
Miss
Matty
at
any
time
,
be
sure
of
Mr
Peter
's
cordial
regard
.
   
<EOS>
peace
to
CRANFORD
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
surprising
that
Mr
Peter
become
such
a
favourite
at
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
vie
with
each
other
who
should
admire
him
most
;
and
no
wonder
,
for
their
quiet
life
be
astonishingly
stir
up
by
the
arrival
from
India
 
especially
as
the
person
arrive
tell
more
wonderful
story
than
sindbad
the
Sailor
;
and
,
as
Miss
Pole
say
,
be
quite
as
good
as
an
Arabian
Night
any
evening
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
vibrate
all
my
life
between
Drumble
and
Cranford
,
and
I
think
it
be
quite
possible
that
all
Mr
Peter
's
story
may
be
true
,
although
wonderful
;
but
when
I
find
that
,
if
we
swallow
an
anecdote
of
tolerable
magnitude
one
week
,
we
have
the
dose
considerably
increase
the
next
,
I
begin
to
have
my
doubt
;
especially
as
I
notice
that
when
his
sister
be
present
the
account
of
indian
life
be
comparatively
tame
;
not
that
she
know
more
than
we
do
,
perhaps
less
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
also
that
when
the
rector
come
to
call
,
Mr
Peter
talk
in
a
different
way
about
the
country
he
have
be
in
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
think
the
lady
in
Cranford
would
have
consider
him
such
a
wonderful
traveller
if
they
have
only
hear
him
talk
in
the
quiet
way
he
do
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
like
him
the
well
,
indeed
,
for
be
what
they
call
"
so
very
oriental
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
at
a
select
party
in
his
honour
,
which
Miss
Pole
give
,
and
from
which
,
as
Mrs
Jamieson
honour
it
with
her
presence
,
and
have
even
offer
to
send
Mr
Mulliner
to
wait
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Hoggins
and
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
be
necessarily
 
exclude
one
day
at
Miss
Pole
's
,
Mr
Peter
say
he
be
tired
of
sit
upright
against
the
hard
-
back
uneasy
chair
,
and
ask
if
he
may
not
indulge
himself
in
sit
cross
-
legged
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
's
consent
be
eagerly
give
,
and
down
he
go
with
the
utmost
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
Miss
Pole
ask
me
,
in
an
audible
whisper
,
"
if
he
do
not
remind
me
of
the
Father
of
the
faithful
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
help
thinking
of
poor
Simon
Jones
,
the
lame
tailor
,
and
while
Mrs
Jamieson
slowly
comment
on
the
elegance
and
convenience
of
the
attitude
,
I
remember
how
we
have
all
follow
that
lady
's
lead
in
condemn
Mr
Hoggins
for
vulgarity
because
he
simply
cross
his
leg
as
he
sit
still
on
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
Mr
Peter
's
way
of
eat
be
a
little
strange
amongst
such
lady
as
Miss
Pole
,
and
Miss
Matty
,
and
Mrs
Jamieson
,
especially
when
I
recollect
the
untasted
green
pea
and
two
-
pronged
fork
at
poor
Mr
Holbrook
's
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
the
mention
of
that
gentleman
's
name
recall
to
my
mind
a
conversation
between
Mr
Peter
and
Miss
Matty
one
evening
in
the
summer
after
he
return
to
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
have
be
very
hot
,
and
Miss
Matty
have
be
much
oppress
by
the
weather
,
in
the
heat
of
which
her
brother
revel
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
she
have
be
unable
to
nurse
Martha
's
baby
,
which
have
become
her
favourite
employment
of
late
,
and
which
be
as
much
at
home
in
her
arm
as
in
its
mother
's
,
as
long
as
it
remain
a
light
-
weight
,
portable
by
one
so
fragile
as
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
this
day
to
which
I
refer
,
Miss
Matty
have
seem
more
than
usually
feeble
and
languid
,
and
only
revive
when
the
sun
go
down
,
and
her
sofa
be
wheel
to
the
open
window
,
through
which
,
although
it
look
into
the
principal
street
of
Cranford
,
the
fragrant
smell
of
the
neighbouring
hayfield
come
in
every
now
and
then
,
bear
by
the
soft
breeze
that
stir
the
dull
air
of
the
summer
twilight
,
and
then
die
away
.
 
<EOS>
the
silence
of
the
sultry
atmosphere
be
lose
in
the
murmuring
noise
which
come
in
from
many
an
open
window
and
door
;
even
the
child
be
abroad
in
the
street
,
late
as
it
be
(
between
ten
and
eleven
)
,
enjoy
the
game
of
play
for
which
they
have
not
have
spirit
during
the
heat
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
Miss
Matty
to
see
how
few
candle
be
light
,
even
in
the
apartment
of
those
house
from
which
issue
the
great
sign
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
,
Miss
Matty
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
all
be
quiet
,
each
with
a
separate
reverie
,
for
some
little
time
,
when
Mr
Peter
break
in
     
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
little
Matty
,
I
could
have
swear
you
be
on
the
high
road
to
matrimony
when
I
leave
England
that
last
time
!
 
<EOS>
if
anybody
have
tell
me
you
would
have
live
and
die
an
old
maid
then
,
I
should
have
laugh
in
their
face
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
make
no
reply
,
and
I
try
in
vain
to
think
of
some
subject
which
should
effectually
turn
the
conversation
;
but
I
be
very
stupid
;
and
before
I
speak
he
go
on
     
<EOS>
"
It
be
Holbrook
,
that
fine
manly
fellow
who
live
at
Woodley
,
that
I
use
to
think
would
carry
off
my
little
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
think
it
now
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
Mary
;
but
this
sister
of
mine
be
once
a
very
pretty
girl
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
I
think
so
,
and
so
I
have
a
notion
do
poor
Holbrook
.
 
<EOS>
what
business
have
he
to
die
before
I
come
home
to
thank
him
for
all
his
kindness
to
a
good
-
for
-
nothing
cub
as
I
be
?
<EOS>
It
be
that
that
make
me
first
think
he
care
for
you
;
for
in
all
our
fishing
expedition
it
be
Matty
,
Matty
<EOS>
,
we
talk
about
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Deborah
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
lecture
she
read
me
on
have
ask
him
home
to
lunch
one
day
,
when
she
have
see
the
Arley
carriage
in
the
town
,
and
think
that
my
lady
may
call
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
that
be
long
year
ago
;
more
than
half
a
life
-
time
,
and
yet
it
seem
like
yesterday
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
a
fellow
I
should
have
like
better
as
a
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
play
your
card
badly
,
my
little
Matty
,
somehow
or
another
 
want
your
brother
to
be
a
good
go
-
between
,
eh
,
little
one
?
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
put
out
his
hand
to
take
hold
of
her
as
she
lie
on
the
sofa
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
be
this
?
<EOS>
you
be
shiver
and
shake
,
Matty
,
with
that
confound
open
window
.
 
<EOS>
Shut
it
,
Mary
,
this
minute
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
and
then
stoop
down
to
kiss
Miss
Matty
,
and
see
if
she
really
be
chill
.
 
<EOS>
She
catch
at
my
hand
,
and
give
it
a
hard
squeeze
 
but
unconsciously
<EOS>
,
I
think
 
for
in
a
minute
or
two
she
speak
to
us
quite
in
her
usual
voice
,
and
smile
our
uneasiness
away
,
although
she
patiently
submit
to
the
prescription
we
enforce
of
a
warm
bed
and
a
glass
of
weak
negus
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
leave
Cranford
the
next
day
,
and
before
I
go
<EOS>
I
see
that
all
the
effect
of
the
open
window
have
quite
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
superintend
most
of
the
alteration
necessary
in
the
house
and
household
during
the
latter
week
of
my
stay
.
 
<EOS>
the
shop
be
once
more
a
parlour
:
 
the
empty
resound
room
again
furnish
up
to
the
very
garret
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
some
talk
of
establish
Martha
and
Jem
in
another
house
,
but
Miss
Matty
would
not
hear
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
never
see
her
so
much
rouse
as
when
Miss
Pole
have
assume
it
to
be
the
most
desirable
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
as
long
as
Martha
would
remain
with
Miss
Matty
,
Miss
Matty
be
only
too
thankful
to
have
her
about
her
;
yes
,
and
Jem
too
,
who
be
a
very
pleasant
man
to
have
in
the
house
,
for
she
never
see
him
from
week
's
end
to
week
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
for
the
probable
child
,
if
they
would
all
turn
out
such
little
darling
as
her
god
-
daughter
,
Matilda
<EOS>
,
she
should
not
mind
the
number
,
if
Martha
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
the
next
be
to
be
call
Deborah
 
a
point
which
Miss
Matty
have
reluctantly
yield
to
Martha
's
stubborn
determination
that
her
first
-
bear
be
to
be
Matilda
.
 
<EOS>
so
Miss
Pole
have
to
lower
her
colour
,
and
even
her
voice
,
as
she
say
to
me
that
,
as
Mr
and
Mrs
Hearn
be
still
to
go
on
live
in
the
same
house
with
Miss
Matty
,
we
have
certainly
do
a
wise
thing
in
hire
Martha
's
niece
as
an
auxiliary
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
Miss
Matty
and
Mr
Peter
most
comfortable
and
contented
;
the
only
subject
for
regret
to
the
tender
heart
of
the
one
,
and
the
social
friendly
nature
of
the
other
,
be
the
unfortunate
quarrel
between
Mrs
Jamieson
and
the
plebeian
Hogginses
and
their
following
.
 
<EOS>
in
joke
,
I
prophesy
one
day
that
this
would
only
last
until
Mrs
Jamieson
or
Mr
Mulliner
be
ill
,
in
which
case
they
would
only
be
too
glad
to
be
friend
with
Mr
Hoggins
;
but
Miss
Matty
do
not
like
my
look
forward
to
anything
like
illness
in
so
light
a
manner
,
and
before
the
year
be
out
all
have
come
round
in
a
far
more
satisfactory
way
.
  
<EOS>
I
receive
two
Cranford
letter
on
one
auspicious
October
morning
.
<EOS>
both
Miss
Pole
and
Miss
Matty
write
to
ask
me
to
come
over
and
meet
the
Gordons
,
who
have
return
to
England
alive
and
well
with
their
two
child
,
now
almost
grow
up
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Jessie
Brown
have
keep
her
old
kind
nature
,
although
she
have
change
her
name
and
station
;
and
she
write
to
say
that
she
and
Major
Gordon
expect
to
be
in
Cranford
on
the
fourteenth
,
and
she
hope
and
beg
to
be
remember
to
Mrs
Jamieson
(
name
first
,
as
become
her
honourable
station
)
,
Miss
Pole
and
Miss
Matty
 
could
she
ever
forget
their
kindness
to
her
poor
father
and
sister
?
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
,
Mr
Hoggins
(
and
here
again
come
in
an
allusion
to
kindness
show
to
the
dead
long
ago
)
,
his
new
wife
,
who
as
such
must
allow
Mrs
Gordon
to
desire
to
make
her
acquaintance
,
and
who
be
,
moreover
,
an
old
Scotch
friend
of
her
husband
's
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
every
one
be
name
,
from
the
rector
 
who
have
be
appoint
to
Cranford
in
the
interim
between
Captain
Brown
's
death
and
Miss
Jessie
's
marriage
,
and
be
now
associate
with
the
latter
event
 
down
to
Miss
Betty
Barker
.
<EOS>
all
be
ask
to
the
luncheon
;
all
except
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
,
who
have
come
to
live
in
Cranford
since
Miss
Jessie
Brown
's
day
,
and
whom
I
find
rather
mope
on
account
of
the
omission
.
 
<EOS>
People
wonder
at
Miss
Betty
Barker
's
be
include
in
the
honourable
list
;
but
,
then
,
as
Miss
Pole
say
,
we
must
remember
the
disregard
of
the
genteel
propriety
of
life
in
which
the
poor
captain
have
educate
his
girl
,
and
for
his
sake
we
swallow
our
pride
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mrs
Jamieson
rather
take
it
as
a
compliment
,
as
put
Miss
Betty
(
formerly
HER
maid
)
on
a
level
with
"
those
hogginse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
when
I
arrive
in
Cranford
,
nothing
be
as
yet
ascertain
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
own
intention
;
would
the
honourable
lady
go
,
or
would
she
not
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
declare
that
she
should
and
she
would
;
Miss
Pole
shake
her
head
and
despond
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
Peter
be
a
man
of
resource
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
persuade
Miss
Matty
to
write
to
Mrs
Gordon
,
and
to
tell
her
of
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
's
existence
,
and
to
beg
that
one
so
kind
,
and
cordial
,
and
generous
,
may
be
include
in
the
pleasant
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
an
answer
come
back
by
return
of
post
,
with
a
pretty
little
note
for
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
,
and
a
request
that
Miss
Matty
would
deliver
it
herself
and
explain
the
previous
omission
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
be
as
pleased
as
could
be
,
and
thank
Miss
Matty
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
have
say
,
"
leave
Mrs
Jamieson
to
me
;
"
so
we
do
;
especially
as
we
know
nothing
that
we
could
do
to
alter
her
determination
if
once
form
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
nor
do
Miss
Matty
<EOS>
,
how
thing
be
go
on
,
until
Miss
Pole
ask
me
,
just
the
day
before
Mrs
Gordon
come
,
if
I
think
there
be
anything
between
Mr
Peter
and
Mrs
Jamieson
in
the
matrimonial
line
,
for
that
Mrs
Jamieson
be
really
go
to
the
lunch
at
the
"
George
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
have
send
Mr
Mulliner
down
to
desire
that
there
may
be
a
footstool
put
to
the
warm
seat
in
the
room
,
as
she
mean
to
come
,
and
know
that
their
chair
be
very
high
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
have
pick
this
piece
of
news
up
,
and
from
it
she
conjecture
all
sort
of
thing
,
and
bemoan
yet
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
Peter
should
marry
,
what
would
become
of
poor
dear
Miss
Matty
?
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs
Jamieson
,
of
all
people
!
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
seem
to
think
there
be
other
lady
in
Cranford
who
would
have
do
more
credit
to
his
choice
,
and
I
think
she
must
have
have
someone
who
be
unmarried
in
her
head
,
for
she
keep
say
,
"
It
be
so
want
in
delicacy
in
a
widow
to
think
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
I
get
back
to
Miss
Matty
's
I
really
do
begin
to
think
that
Mr
Peter
may
be
think
of
Mrs
Jamieson
for
a
wife
,
and
I
be
as
unhappy
as
Miss
Pole
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
the
proof
sheet
of
a
great
placard
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Signor
Brunoni
,
Magician
to
the
King
of
Delhi
,
the
Rajah
of
Oude
,
and
the
great
Lama

"
&
c.
&
c.
,
be
go
to

perform
in
Cranford
for
one
night
only
,
"
the
very
next
night
;
and
Miss
Matty
,
exultant
,
show
me
a
letter
from
the
Gordons
,
promise
to
remain
over
this
gaiety
,
which
Miss
Matty
say
be
entirely
Peter
's
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
write
to
ask
the
signor
to
come
,
and
be
to
be
at
all
the
expense
of
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
ticket
be
to
be
send
gratis
to
as
many
as
the
room
would
hold
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
Miss
Matty
be
charm
with
the
plan
,
and
say
that
to
-
morrow
Cranford
would
remind
her
of
the
Preston
Guild
,
to
which
she
have
be
in
her
youth
 
<EOS>
a
luncheon
at
the
"
George
,
"
with
the
dear
Gordons
,
and
the
signor
in
the
Assembly
Room
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
 
I
look
only
at
the
fatal
word
:
    
"
<EOS>
under
the
patronage
of
the
HONOURABLE
MRS
JAMIESON
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
,
then
,
be
choose
to
preside
over
this
entertainment
of
Mr
Peter
's
;
she
be
perhaps
go
to
displace
my
dear
Miss
Matty
in
his
heart
,
and
make
her
life
lonely
once
more
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
look
forward
to
the
morrow
with
any
pleasure
;
and
every
innocent
anticipation
of
Miss
Matty
's
only
serve
to
add
to
my
annoyance
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
angry
and
irritated
,
and
exaggerate
every
little
incident
which
could
add
to
my
irritation
,
I
go
on
till
we
be
all
assemble
in
the
great
parlour
at
the
"
George
.
"
 
<EOS>
major
and
Mrs
Gordon
and
pretty
Flora
and
Mr
Ludovic
be
all
as
bright
and
handsome
and
friendly
as
could
be
;
but
I
could
hardly
attend
to
them
for
watch
Mr
Peter
,
and
I
see
that
Miss
Pole
be
equally
busy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
Mrs
Jamieson
so
rouse
and
animate
before
;
her
face
look
full
of
interest
in
what
Mr
Peter
be
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
draw
near
to
listen
.
 
<EOS>
My
relief
be
great
when
I
catch
that
his
word
be
not
word
of
love
,
but
that
,
for
all
his
grave
face
,
he
be
at
his
old
trick
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
tell
her
of
his
travel
in
India
,
and
describe
the
wonderful
height
of
the
Himalaya
mountain
:
 
one
touch
after
another
add
to
their
size
,
and
each
exceed
the
former
in
absurdity
;
but
Mrs
Jamieson
really
enjoy
all
in
perfect
good
faith
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
require
strong
stimulant
to
excite
her
to
come
out
of
her
apathy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
wind
up
his
account
by
say
that
,
of
course
,
at
that
altitude
there
be
none
of
the
animal
to
be
find
that
exist
in
the
low
region
;
the
game
,
 
everything
be
different
.
 
<EOS>
fire
one
day
at
some
fly
creature
,
he
be
very
much
dismayed
when
it
fall
,
to
find
that
he
have
shoot
a
cherubim
!
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
catch
my
eye
at
this
moment
,
and
give
me
such
a
funny
twinkle
,
that
I
feel
sure
he
have
no
thought
of
Mrs
Jamieson
as
a
wife
from
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
uncomfortably
amazed
     
<EOS>
"
but
,
Mr
Peter
,
shoot
a
cherubim
 
do
not
you
think
 
I
be
afraid
that
be
sacrilege
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
compose
his
countenance
in
a
moment
,
and
appear
shocked
at
the
idea
,
which
,
as
he
say
truly
enough
,
be
now
present
to
him
for
the
first
time
;
but
then
Mrs
Jamieson
must
remember
that
he
have
be
live
for
a
long
time
among
savage
 
all
of
whom
be
heathen
 
some
of
them
,
he
be
afraid
,
be
downright
dissenter
.
<EOS>
then
,
see
Miss
Matty
draw
near
,
he
hastily
change
the
conversation
,
and
after
a
little
while
,
turn
to
me
,
he
say
,
"
do
not
be
shocked
,
prim
little
Mary
,
at
all
my
wonderful
story
.
<EOS>
I
consider
Mrs
Jamieson
fair
game
,
and
besides
I
be
bent
on
propitiate
her
,
and
the
first
step
towards
it
be
keep
her
well
awake
.
 
<EOS>
I
bribe
her
here
by
ask
her
to
let
me
have
her
name
as
patroness
for
my
poor
conjuror
this
evening
;
and
I
do
not
want
to
give
her
time
enough
to
get
up
her
rancour
against
the
Hogginses
,
who
be
just
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
everybody
to
be
friend
,
for
it
harass
Matty
so
much
to
hear
of
these
quarrel
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
go
at
it
again
by
-
and
-
by
,
so
you
need
not
look
shocked
.
 
<EOS>
I
intend
to
enter
the
Assembly
Room
to
-
night
with
Mrs
Jamieson
on
one
side
,
and
my
lady
,
Mrs
Hoggins
,
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
if
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
somehow
or
another
he
do
;
and
fairly
get
them
into
conversation
together
.
 
<EOS>
Major
and
Mrs
Gordon
help
at
the
good
work
with
their
perfect
ignorance
of
any
exist
coolness
between
any
of
the
inhabitant
of
Cranford
.
  
<EOS>
ever
since
that
day
there
have
be
the
old
friendly
sociability
in
Cranford
society
;
which
I
be
thankful
for
,
because
of
my
dear
Miss
Matty
's
love
of
peace
and
kindliness
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
love
Miss
Matty
,
and
I
somehow
think
we
be
all
of
us
better
when
she
be
near
us
