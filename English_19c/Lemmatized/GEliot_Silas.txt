to

<EOS>
in
this

it
come
to

that
those
scatter

weaver
 
emigrant
from

into
the
country
 
be
to
the
last
regard
as
alien
by

usually
contract
the
eccentric

which
belong
to
a
state

<EOS>
in
the
early
year
of
this
century
,
such
a
linen
-
weaver
,
name
Silas
Marner
,
work
at
his
vocation
in
a
stone
cottage
that
stand
among
the
nutty
hedgerow
near
the
village
of
Raveloe
,
and
not
far
from
the
edge
of
a
desert
stone
-
pit
.
 
<EOS>
the
questionable
sound
of
Silas
's
loom
,
<EOS>
so
unlike
the
natural
cheerful
trotting
of
the
winnowing
-
machine
,
or
the
simple
rhythm
of
the
flail
,
have
a
half
-
fearful
fascination
for
the
Raveloe
boy
,
who
would
often
leave
off
their
nutting
or
bird
'
 
nest
to
peep
in
at
the
window
of
the
stone
cottage
,
counterbalance
a
certain
awe
at
the
mysterious
action
of
the
loom
,
by
a
pleasant
sense
of
scornful
superiority
,
draw
from
the
mockery
of
its
alternate
noise
,
along
with
the
bent
,
tread
-
mill
attitude
of
the
weaver
.
 
<EOS>
but
sometimes
it
happen
that
Marner
,
pause
to
adjust
an
irregularity
in
his
thread
,
become
aware
of
the
small
scoundrel
,
and
,
though
chary
of
his
time
,
he
like
their
intrusion
so
ill
that
he
would
descend
from
his
loom
,
and
,
open
the
door
,
<EOS>
would
fix
on
them
a
gaze
that
be
always
enough
to
make
them
take
to
their
leg
in
terror
.
 
<EOS>
for
how
be
it
possible
to
believe
that
those
large
brown
protuberant
eye
in
Silas
Marner
's
pale
face
really
see
nothing
very
distinctly
that
be
not
close
to
them
,
and
not
rather
that
their
dreadful
stare
could
dart
cramp
,
or
ricket
,
or
a
wry
mouth
at
any
boy
who
happen
to
be
in
the
rear
?
 
<EOS>
They
have
,
perhaps
,
hear
their
father
and
mother
hint
that
Silas
Marner
could
cure
folk
'
rheumatism
if
he
have
a
mind
,
and
add
,
still
more
darkly
,
that
if
you
could
only
speak
the
devil
fair
enough
,
he
may
save
you
the
cost
of
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
such
strange
linger
echo
of
the
old
demon
-
worship
may
perhaps
even
now
be
catch
by
the
diligent
listener
among
the
grey
-
haired
peasantry
;
for
the
rude
mind
with
difficulty
associate
the
idea
of
power
and
benignity
.
 
<EOS>
a
shadowy
conception
of
power
that
by
much
persuasion
can
be
induce
to
refrain
from
inflicting
harm
,
be
the
shape
most
easily
take
by
the
sense
of
the
invisible
in
the
mind
of
man
who
have
always
be
press
close
by
primitive
want
,
and
to
whom
a
life
of
hard
toil
have
never
be
illuminate
by
any
enthusiastic
religious
faith
.
 
<EOS>
to
them
pain
and
mishap
<EOS>
present
a
far
wide
range
of
possibility
than
gladness
and
enjoyment
:
their
imagination
be
almost
barren
of
the
image
that
feed
desire

be
all
overgrow
by
recollection
that

"

anything

refuse

"
no

he
answer
,
"
I
have
never

use
to
nothing
but
common
victual
,
and
I
can
not
eat
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
experience
have
breed
no
fancy
in
him
that
could
raise
the
phantasm
of
appetite
.
  
<EOS>
and
Raveloe
be
a
village
where
many
of
the
old
echo
linger
,
undrowne
by
new
voice
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
it
be
one
of
those
barren
parish
lie
on
the
outskirt
of
civilization
 
inhabit
by
meagre
sheep
and
thinly
-
scatter
shepherd
:
on
the
contrary
,
it
lie
in
the
rich
central
plain
of
what
we
be
pleased
to
call
Merry
England
,
and
hold
farm
which
,
speak
from
a
spiritual
point
of
view

pay
highly

desirable
tithe

<EOS>
but
it
be
nestle
in
a
snug
well
-
woode
hollow
,
quite
an
hour
's
journey
on
horseback
from
any
turnpike
,
where
it
be
never
reach
by
the
vibration
of
the

or
of

opinion

<EOS>
It
be
an
important

look
village

with
a
fine
old
church
and
large
churchyard
in
the
heart
of
it

and
two

three
large
brick

stone

with
well

walled
orchard

ornamental
weathercock

stand
close

the
rectory

which
peep
from
among
the
tree
on
the
other
side
of
the
churchyard
:
 
a
village
which
show
at
once
the
summit
of
its
social
life
,
and
tell
the
practised
eye
that
there
be
no
great
park
and
manor
-
house
in
the
vicinity
,
but
that
there
be
several
chief
in
Raveloe
who
could
farm
badly
quite
at
their
ease
,
draw
enough
money
from
their
bad
farming
,
in
those
war
time

to

<EOS>
It
be
fifteen
year
since
Silas
Marner
have
first
come
to
Raveloe
;
he
be
then
simply
a
pallid
young
man
,
with
prominent
short
-
sight
brown
eye
,
whose
appearance
would
have
have
nothing
strange
for
people
of
average
culture
and
experience
,
but
for
the
villager
near
whom
he
have
come
to
settle
it
have
mysterious
peculiarity
which
correspond
with
the
exceptional
nature
of
his
occupation
,
and
his
advent
from
an
unknown
region
call
"
North'ard
"
.
 
<EOS>
so
have
his
way
of
life
:
 
<EOS>
he
invite
no
comer
to
step
across
his
door
-
sill
,
and
he
never
stroll
into
the
village
to
drink
a
pint
at
the
Rainbow
,
or
to
gossip
at
the
wheelwright
's
:
he
seek
no
man
or
woman
,
save
for
the
purpose
of
his
calling
,
or
in
order
to
supply
himself
with
necessary
;
and
it
be
soon
clear
to
the
Raveloe
lass
that
he
would
never
urge
one
of
them
to
accept
him
against
her
<EOS>
will
 
<EOS>
quite
as
if
he
have
hear
them
declare
that
they
would
never
marry
a
dead
man
come
to
life
again
.
 
<EOS>
this
view
of
Marner
's
personality
be
not
without
another
ground
than
his
pale
face
and
unexampled
eye
;
for
Jem
Rodney
,
the
mole
-
catcher
,
aver
that
one
evening
as
he
be
return
homeward
,
he
see
Silas
Marner
lean
against
a
stile
with
a
heavy
bag
on
his
back
,
instead
of
rest
the
bag
on
the
stile
as
a
man
in
his
sense
would
have
do
;
and
that
,
on
come
up
to
him
,
he
see
that
Marner
's
eye
be
set
like
a
dead
man
's
,
and
he
speak
to
him
,
and
shake
him
,
and
his
limb
be
stiff
,
and
his
hand
clutch
the
bag
as
if
they
would
be
make
of
iron
;
but
just
as
he
have
make
up
his
mind
that
the
weaver
be
dead
,
he
come
all
right
again
,
like
,
as
you
may
say
,
in
the
winking
of
an
eye
,
and
say
"
good
-
night
"
,
and
walk
off
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
Jem
swear
he
have
see
,
more
by
token
that
it
be
the
very
day
he
have
be
mole
-
catch
on
Squire
Cass
's
land
,
down
by
the
old
saw
-
pit
.
 
<EOS>
some
say
Marner
must
have
be
in
a
"
fit
"
,
a
word
which
seem
to
explain
thing
otherwise
incredible
;
but
the
argumentative
Mr.
Macey
,
clerk
of
the
parish
,
shake
his
head
,
and
ask
if
anybody
be
ever
know
to
go
off
in
a
fit
and
not
fall
down
.
 
<EOS>
a
fit
be
a
stroke
,
be
not
it
?
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
in
the
nature
of
a
stroke
to
partly
take
away
the
use
of
a
man
's
limb
and
throw
him
on
the
parish
,
if
he
would
get
no
child
to
look
to
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
<EOS>
;
it
be
no
stroke
that
would
let
a
man
stand
on
his
leg
,
like
a
horse
between
the
shaft
,
and
then
walk
off
as
soon
as
you
can
say
"
gee
!
"
<EOS>
but
there
may
be
such
a
thing
as
a
man
's
soul
be
loose
from
his
body
,
and
go
out
and
in
,
like
a
bird
out
of
its
nest
and
back
;
and
that
be
how
folk
get
over
-
wise
,
for
they
go
to
school
in
this
shell
-
less
state
to
those
who
could
teach
them
more
than
their
neighbour
could
learn
with
their
five
sense
and
the
parson
.
 
<EOS>
and
where
do
Master
Marner
get
his
knowledge
of
herb
from
 
and
charm
too
,
if
he
like
to
give
them
away
?
 
<EOS>
Jem
Rodney
's
story
be
no
more
than
what
may
have
be
expect
by
anybody
who
have
see
how
Marner
have
cure
Sally
Oates
,
and
make
her
sleep
like
a
baby
,
when
her
heart
have
be
beat
enough
to
burst
her
body
,
for
two
month
and
more
,
while
she
have
be
under
the
doctor
's
care
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
cure
more
folk
if
he
would
;
but
he
be
worth
speak
fair
,
if
it
be
only
to
keep
him
from
do
you
a
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
partly
to
this
vague
fear
that
Marner
be
indebte
for
protect
him
from
the
persecution
that
his
singularity
may
have
draw
upon
him
,
but
still
more
to
the
fact
that
,
the
old
linen
-
weaver
in
the
neighbour
parish
of
Tarley
be
dead
,
his
handicraft
make
him
a
highly
welcome
settler
to
the
rich
housewife
of
the
district
,
and
even
to
the
more
provident
cottager
,
who
have
their
little
stock
of
yarn
at
the
year
's
end
.
<EOS>
Their
sense
of
his
usefulness
would
have
counteract
any
repugnance
or
suspicion
which
be
not
confirm
by
a
deficiency
in
the
quality
or
the
tale
of
the
cloth
he
wove
for
them
.
<EOS>
and
the
year
have
roll
on
without
produce
any
change
in
the
impression
of
the
neighbour
concern
Marner
,
except
the
change
from
novelty
to
habit
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
fifteen
year
the
Raveloe
man
say
just
the
same
thing
about
Silas
Marner
as
at
the
beginning
:
they
do
not
say
them
quite
so
often
,
but
they
believe
them
much
more
strongly
when
they
do
say
them
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
important
addition
which
the
year
have
bring
:
it
be
,
that
Master
Marner
have
lay
by
a
fine
sight
of
money
somewhere
,
and
that
he
could
buy
up
"
big
man
"
than
himself
.
  
<EOS>
but
while
opinion
concern
him
have
remain
nearly
stationary
,
and
his
daily
habit
have
present
scarcely
any
visible
change
,
Marner
's
inward
life
have
be
a
history
and
a
metamorphosis
,
as
that
of
every
fervid
nature
must
be
when
it
have
flee
,
or
be
condemn
,
to
solitude
.
<EOS>
His
life
,
before
he
come
to
Raveloe
,
have
be
fill
with
the
movement
,
the
mental
activity
,
and
the
close
fellowship
,
which
,
in
that
day
as
in
this
,
mark
the
life
of
an
artisan
early
incorporate
in
a
narrow
religious
sect
,
where
the
poor
layman
have
the
chance
of
distinguish
himself
by
gift
of
speech
,
and
have
,
at
the
very
least
,
the
weight
of
a
silent
voter
in
the
government
of
his
community
.
<EOS>
Marner
be
highly
think
of
in
that
little
hide
world
,
know
to
itself
as
the
church
assemble
in
Lantern
Yard
;
he
be
believe
to
be
a
young
man
of
exemplary
life
and
ardent
faith
;
and
a
peculiar
interest
have
be
centre
in
him
ever
since
he
have
fall
,
at
a
prayer
-
meeting
,
into
a
mysterious
rigidity
and
suspension
of
consciousness
,
which
,
last
for
an
hour
or
more
,
have
be
mistake
for
death
.
 
<EOS>
to
have
seek
a
medical
explanation
for
this
phenomenon
would
have
be
hold
by
Silas
himself
,
as
well
as
by
his
minister
and
fellow
-
member
,
a
wilful
self
-
exclusion
from
the
spiritual
significance
that
may
lie
therein
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
be
evidently
a
brother
select
for
a
peculiar
discipline
;
and
though
the
effort
to
interpret
this
discipline
be
discourage
by
the
absence
,
on
his
part
,
of
any
spiritual
vision
during
his
outward
trance
,
yet
it
be
believe
by
himself
and
other
that
its
effect
be
see
in
an
accession
of
light
and
fervour
.
<EOS>
a
less
truthful
man
than
he
may
have
be
tempt
into
the
subsequent
creation
of
a
vision
in
the
form
of
resurgent
memory
;
a
less
sane
man
may
have
believe
in
such
a
creation
;
but
Silas
be
both
sane
and
honest
,
though
,
as
with
many
honest
and
fervent
man
,
culture
have
not
define
any
channel
for
his
sense
of
mystery
,
and
so
it
spread
itself
over
the
proper
pathway
of
inquiry
and
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
inherit
from
his
mother
some
acquaintance
with
medicinal
herb
and
their
preparation
 
a
little
store
of
wisdom
which
she
have
impart
to
him
as
a
solemn
bequest
 
but
<EOS>
of
late
year
he
have
have
doubt
about
the
lawfulness
of
apply
this
knowledge
,
believe
that
herb
could
have
no
efficacy
without
prayer
,
and
that
prayer
may
suffice
without
herb
;
so
that
the
inherit
delight
he
have
in
wander
in
the
field
in
search
of
foxglove
and
dandelion
and
coltsfoot
,
begin
to
wear
to
him
the
character
of
a
temptation
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
member
of
his
church
there
be
one
young
man
,
a
little
old
than
himself
,
with
whom
he
have
long
live
in
such
close
friendship
that
it
be
the
custom
of
their
Lantern
Yard
brother
to
call
them
David
and
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
the
real
name
of
the
friend
be
William
Dane
,
and
he
,
too
,
be
regard
as
a
shine
instance
of
youthful
piety
,
though
somewhat
give
to
over
-
severity
towards
weak
brother
,
and
to
be
so
dazzle
by
his
own
light
as
to
hold
himself
wise
than
his
teacher
.
 
<EOS>
but
whatever
blemish
other
may
discern
in
William
,
to
his
friend
's
mind
he
be
faultless
;
for
Marner
have
one
of
those
impressible
self
-
doubt
nature
which
,
at
an
inexperienced
age
,
admire
imperativeness
and
lean
on
contradiction
.
 
<EOS>
the
expression
of
trust
simplicity
in
Marner
's
face
,
heighten
by
that
absence
of
special
observation
,
that
defenceless
,
deer
-
like
gaze
which
belong
to
large
prominent
eye
,
be
strongly
contrast
by
the
self
-
complacent
suppression
of
inward
triumph
that
lurk
in
the
narrow
slanting
eye
and
compress
lip
of
William
Dane
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
most
frequent
topic
of
conversation
between
the
two
friend
be
Assurance
of
salvation
:
<EOS>
Silas
confess
that
he
could
never
arrive
at
anything
high
than
hope
mingle
with
fear
,
and
listen
with
longing
wonder
when
William
declare
that
he
have
possess
unshaken
assurance
ever
since
,
in
the
period
of
his
conversion
,
he
have
dream
that
he
see
the
word
"
calling
and
election
sure
"
stand
by
themselves
on
a
white
page
in
the
open
Bible
.
 
<EOS>
such
colloquy
have
occupy
many
a
pair
of
pale
-
face
weaver
,
whose
unnurtured
soul
have
be
like
young
wing
thing
,
flutter
forsaken
in
the
twilight
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
seem
to
the
unsuspecting
Silas
that
the
friendship
have
suffer
no
chill
even
from
his
formation
of
another
attachment
of
a
close
kind
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
month
he
have
be
engage
to
a
young
servant
-
woman
,
wait
only
for
a
little
increase
to
their
mutual
saving
in
order
to
their
marriage
;
and
it
be
a
great
delight
to
him
that
Sarah
do
not
object
to
William
's
occasional
presence
in
their
Sunday
interview
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
at
this
point
in
their
history
that
Silas
's
cataleptic
fit
occur
during
the
prayer
-
meeting
;
and
amidst
the
various
query
and
expression
of
interest
address
to
him
by
his
fellow
-
member
,
William
's
suggestion
alone
jar
with
the
general
sympathy
towards
a
brother
thus
single
out
for
special
dealing
.
 
<EOS>
He
observe
that
,
to
him
,
this
trance
look
more
like
a
visitation
of
Satan
than
a
proof
of
divine
favour
,
and
exhort
his
friend
to
see
that
he
hide
no
accursed
thing
within
his
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
,
feel
bind
to
accept
rebuke
and
admonition
as
a
brotherly
office
,
feel
no
resentment
,
but
only
pain
,
at
his
friend
's
doubt
concern
him
;
and
to
this
be
soon
add
some
anxiety
at
the
perception
that
Sarah
's
manner
towards
him
begin
to
exhibit
a
strange
fluctuation
between
an
effort
at
an
increase
manifestation
of
regard
and
involuntary
sign
of
shrink
and
dislike
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
her
if
she
wish
to
break
off
their
engagement
;
but
she
deny
this
:
their
engagement
be
know
to
the
church
,
and
have
be
recognize
in
the
prayer
-
meeting
;
it
could
not
be
break
off
without
strict
investigation
,
and
Sarah
could
render
no
reason
that
would
be
sanction
by
the
feeling
of
the
community
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
time
the
senior
deacon
be
take
dangerously
ill
,
and
,
be
a
childless
widower
,
he
be
tend
night
and
day
by
some
of
the
young
brother
or
sister
.
<EOS>
Silas
frequently
take
his
turn
in
the
night
-
watch
with
William
,
the
one
relieve
the
other
at
two
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
,
contrary
to
expectation
,
seem
to
be
on
the
way
to
recovery
,
when
one
night
Silas
,
sit
up
by
his
bedside
,
observe
that
his
usual
audible
breathing
have
cease
.
 
<EOS>
the
candle
be
burn
low
,
and
he
have
to
lift
it
to
see
the
patient
's
face
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
examination
convince
him
that
the
deacon
be
dead
 
have
be
dead
some
time
,
for
the
limb
be
rigid
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
ask
himself
if
he
have
be
asleep
,
and
look
at
the
clock
:
it
be
already
four
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
William
have
not
come
?
 
<EOS>
in
much
anxiety
he
go
to
seek
for
help
,
and
soon
there
be
several
friend
assemble
in
the
house
,
the
minister
among
them
,
while
Silas
go
away
to
his
work
,
wish
he
could
have
meet
William
to
know
the
reason
of
his
non
-
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
six
o'clock
,
as
he
be
think
of
go
to
seek
his
friend
,
William
come
,
and
with
him
the
minister
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
to
summon
him
to
Lantern
Yard
,
to
meet
the
church
member
there
;
and
to
his
inquiry
concern
the
cause
of
the
summon
<EOS>
the
only
reply
be
,
"
You
will
hear
.
"
 
<EOS>
nothing
further
be
say
until
Silas
be
seat
in
the
vestry
,
in
front
of
the
minister
,
with
the
eye
of
those
who
to
him
represent
God
's
people
fix
solemnly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
then
the
minister
,
take
out
a
pocket
-
knife
,
show
it
to
Silas
,
and
ask
him
if
he
know
where
he
have
leave
that
knife
?
 
<EOS>
Silas
say
,
he
do
not
know
that
he
have
leave
it
anywhere
out
of
his
own
pocket
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
tremble
at
this
strange
interrogation
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
then
exhort
not
to
hide
his
sin
,
but
to
confess
and
repent
.
 
<EOS>
the
knife
have
be
find
in
the
bureau
by
the
depart
deacon
's
bedside
 
find
in
the
place
where
the
little
bag
of
church
money
have
lain
,
which
the
minister
himself
have
see
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
some
hand
have
remove
that
bag
;
and
whose
hand
could
it
be
,
if
not
that
of
the
man
to
whom
the
knife
belong
?
 
<EOS>
for
some
time
Silas
be
mute
with
astonishment
:
then
he
say
,
"
God
will
clear
me
:
I
know
nothing
about
the
knife
be
there
,
or
the
money
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
search
me
and
my
dwelling
<EOS>
;
you
will
find
nothing
but
three
pound
five
of
my
own
saving
,
which
William
Dane
know
I
have
have
these
six
month
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
William
groan
,
but
the
minister
say
,
"
the
proof
be
heavy
against
you
,
brother
Marner
.
 
<EOS>
the
money
be
take
in
the
night
last
past
,
and
no
man
be
with
our
depart
brother
<EOS>
but
you
,
for
William
Dane
declare
to
us
that
he
be
hinder
by
sudden
sickness
from
go
to
take
his
place
as
usual
,
and
you
yourself
say
that
he
have
not
come
;
and
,
moreover
,
you
neglect
the
dead
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
sleep
,
"
say
Silas
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
after
a
pause
,
he
add
,
"
<EOS>
or
I
must
have
have
another
visitation
like
that
which
you
have
all
see
me
under
,
so
that
the
thief
must
have
come
and
go
while
I
be
not
in
the
body
,
but
out
of
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
say
again
,
search
me
and
my
dwelling
,
for
I
have
be
nowhere
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
search
be
make
,
and
it
end
 
in
William
Dane
's
find
the
well
-
know
bag
,
empty
,
tuck
behind
the
chest
of
drawer
in
Silas
's
chamber
!
 
<EOS>
on
this
William
exhort
his
friend
to
confess
,
and
not
to
hide
his
sin
any
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
turn
a
look
of
keen
reproach
on
him
,
and
say
,
"
William
,
for
nine
year
that
we
have
go
in
and
out
together
,
have
you
ever
know
me
tell
a
lie
?
 
<EOS>
but
God
will
clear
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
brother
,
"
say
William
,
"
how
do
I
know
what
you
may
have
do
in
the
secret
chamber
of
your
heart
,
to
give
Satan
an
advantage
over
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
be
still
look
at
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
a
deep
flush
come
over
his
face
,
and
he
be
about
to
speak
impetuously
,
when
he
seem
check
again
by
some
inward
shock
,
that
send
the
flush
back
and
make
him
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
last
he
speak
feebly
,
look
at
William
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
now
 
the
knife
be
not
in
my
pocket
.
"
  
<EOS>
William
say
,
"
I
know
nothing
of
what
you
mean
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
other
person
present
,
however
,
begin
to
inquire
where
Silas
mean
to
say
that
the
knife
be
,
but
he
would
give
no
further
explanation
<EOS>
:
he
only
say
,
"
I
be
sore
stricken
;
I
can
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
God
will
clear
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
their
return
to
the
vestry
there
be
further
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
any
resort
to
legal
measure
for
ascertain
the
culprit
be
contrary
to
the
principle
of
the
church
in
Lantern
Yard
,
accord
to
which
prosecution
be
forbid
to
Christians
,
even
have
the
case
hold
less
scandal
to
the
community
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
member
be
bind
to
take
other
measure
for
find
out
the
truth
,
and
they
resolve
on
pray
and
draw
lot
.
 
<EOS>
this
resolution
can
be
a
ground
of
surprise
only
to
those
who
be
unacquainted
with
that
obscure
religious
life
which
have
go
on
in
the
alley
of
our
town
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
kneel
with
his
brother
,
rely
on
his
own
innocence
be
certify
by
immediate
divine
interference
,
but
feel
that
there
be
sorrow
and
mourn
behind
for
him
even
then
 
that
his
trust
in
man
have
be
cruelly
bruise
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
the
lot
declare
that
Silas
Marner
be
guilty
.
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
He
be
solemnly
suspend
from
church
-
membership
,
and
call
upon
to
render
up
the
steal
money
:
only
on
confession
,
as
the
sign
of
repentance
,
could
he
be
receive
once
more
within
the
fold
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
Marner
listen
in
silence
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
everyone
rise
to
depart
,
he
go
towards
William
Dane
and
say
,
in
a
voice
shake
by
agitation
    
<EOS>
"
the
last
time
I
remember
use
my
knife
,
be
when
I
take
it
out
to
cut
a
strap
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
put
it
in
my
pocket
again
.
<EOS>
_
You
_
steal
the
money
,
and
you
have
weave
a
plot
to
lay
the
sin
at
my
door
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
may
prosper
,
for
all
that
:
there
be
no
just
God
that
govern
the
earth
righteously
,
but
a
God
of
lie
,
that
bear
witness
against
the
innocent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
shudder
at
this
blasphemy
.
  
<EOS>
William
say
meekly
,
"
I
leave
our
brother
to
judge
whether
this
be
the
voice
of
Satan
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
nothing
but
pray
for
you
,
Silas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Marner
go
out
with
that
despair
in
his
soul
 
that
shaken
trust
in
God
and
man
,
which
be
little
short
of
madness
to
a
loving
nature
.
<EOS>
in
the
bitterness
of
his
wounded
spirit
,
he
say
to
himself
,
"
_
<EOS>
She
_
will
cast
me
off
too
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
reflect
that
,
if
she
do
not
believe
the
testimony
against
him
,
her
whole
faith
must
be
upset
as
his
be
.
<EOS>
to
people
accustomed
to
reason
about
the
form
in
which
their
religious
feeling
have
incorporate
itself
,
it
be
difficult
to
enter
into
that
simple
,
untaught
state
of
mind
in
which
the
form
and
the
feeling
have
never
be
sever
by
an
act
of
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
apt
to
think
it
inevitable
that
a
man
in
Marner
's
position
should
have
begin
to
question
the
validity
of
an
appeal
to
the
divine
judgment
by
draw
lot
;
but
to
him
this
would
have
be
an
effort
of
independent
thought
such
as
he
have
never
know
;
and
he
must
have
make
the
effort
at
a
moment
when
all
his
energy
be
turn
into
the
anguish
of
disappointed
faith
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
be
an
angel
who
record
the
sorrow
of
man
as
well
as
their
sin
,
he
know
how
many
and
deep
be
the
sorrow
<EOS>
that
spring
from
false
idea
for
which
no
man
be
culpable
.
  
<EOS>
Marner
go
home
,
and
for
a
whole
day
sit
alone
,
stun
by
despair
,
without
any
impulse
to
go
to
Sarah
and
attempt
to
win
her
belief
in
his
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
the
second
day
he
take
refuge
from
benumb
unbelief
,
by
get
into
his
loom
and
work
away
as
usual
;
and
before
many
hour
be
past
,
the
minister
and
one
of
the
deacon
come
to
him
with
the
message
from
Sarah
,
that
she
hold
her
engagement
to
him
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Silas
receive
the
message
mutely

and
then
turn
away
from
the
messenger
to
work
at
his
loom
again
.
 
<EOS>
in
little
more
than
a
month
from
that
time
,
Sarah
be
marry
to
William
Dane
;
and
not
long
afterwards
it
be
know
to
the
brother
in
Lantern
Yard
that
Silas
Marner
have
depart
from
the
town
.
    
<EOS>
even
people
whose
life
have
be
make
various
by
learn
,
sometimes
find
it
hard
to
keep
a
fast
hold
on
their
habitual
view
of
life
,
on
their
faith
in
the
invisible
,
nay
,
on
the
sense
that
their
past
joy
and
sorrow
be
a
real
experience

when
they
be
suddenly
transport
to
a
new
land
,
where
the
being
around
them
know
nothing
of
their
history
,
and
share
none
of
their
idea
 
where
their
mother
earth
show
another
lap

and
human
life
have
other
form
than
those
on
which
their
soul
have
be

<EOS>
mind
that
have
be
unhinge
from
their
old
faith
and
love
,
have
perhaps
seek
this
lethean
influence
of
exile
,
in
which
the
past
become
dreamy
because
its
symbol
have
all
vanish
,
and
the
present
too
be
dreamy
because
it
be
link
with
no
memory
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
_
their
_
experience
may
hardly
enable
them
thoroughly
to
imagine
what
be
the
effect
on
a
simple
weaver
like
Silas
Marner
,
when
he
leave
his
own
country
and
people
and
come
to
settle
in
Raveloe
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
unlike
his
native
town
,
set
within
sight
of
the
widespread
hillside
,
than
this
low
,
wooded
region
,
where
he
feel
hide
even
from
the
heaven
by
the
screening
tree
and
hedgerow
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
here
,
when
he
rise
in
the
deep
morning
quiet
and
look
out
on
the
dewy
bramble
and
rank
tufte
grass
,
<EOS>
that
seem
to
have
any
relation
with
that
life
centre
in
Lantern
Yard
,
which
have
once
be
to
him
the
altar
-
place
of
high
dispensation
.
 
<EOS>
the
whitewashed
wall
;
the
little
pew
where
well
-
know
figure
enter
with
a
subdue
rustling
,
and
where
first
one
well
-
know
voice
and
then
another
,
pitch
in
a
peculiar
key
of
petition
,
uttered
phrase
at
once
occult
and
familiar
,
like
the
amulet
wear
on
the
heart
;
the
pulpit
where
the
minister
deliver
unquestioned
doctrine
,
and
sway
to
and
fro
,
and
handle
the
book
in
a
long
accustomed
manner
;
the
very
pause
between
the
couplet
of
the
hymn
,
as
it
be
give
out
,
and
the
recurrent
swell
of
voice
in
song
:
these
thing
have
be
the
channel
of
divine
influence
to
Marner
 
<EOS>
they
be
the
fostering
home
of
his
religious
emotion
 
<EOS>
they
be
Christianity
and
God
's
kingdom
upon
earth
.
 
<EOS>
a
weaver
who
find
hard
word
in
his
hymn
-
book
know
nothing
of
abstraction
;
as
the
little
child
know
nothing
of
parental
love
,
but
only
know
one
face
and
one
lap
towards
which
it
stretch
its
arm
for
refuge
and
nurture
.
  
<EOS>
and
what
could
be
more
unlike
that
Lantern
Yard
world
than
the
world
in
Raveloe
?
 
<EOS>
orchard
look
lazy
with
neglect
plenty
;
the
large
church
in
the
wide
churchyard
,
which
man
gaze
at
lounge
at
their
own
door
in
service
-
time
<EOS>
;
the
purple
-
face
farmer
jog
along
the
lane
or
turn
in
at
the
Rainbow
;
homestead
,
where
man
sup
heavily
and
sleep
in
the
light
of
the
evening
hearth
,
and
where
woman
seem
to
be
lay
up
a
stock
of
linen
for
the
life
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
lip
in
Raveloe
from
which
a
word
could
fall
that
would
stir
Silas
Marner
's
benumbed
faith
to
a
sense
of
pain
.
<EOS>
in
the
early
age
of
the
world
,
we
know
,
it
be
believe
that
each
territory
be
inhabit
and
rule
by
its
own
divinity
,
so
that
a
man
could
cross
the
bordering
height
and
be
out
of
the
reach
of
his
native
god
,
whose
presence
be
confine
to
the
stream
and
the
grove
and
the
hill
among
which
he
have
live
from
his
birth
.
 
<EOS>
and
poor
Silas
be
vaguely
conscious
of
something
not
unlike
the
feeling
of
primitive
man
,
when
they
flee
thus
,
in
fear
or
in
sullenness
,
from
the
face
of
an
unpropitious
deity
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
that
the
Power
he
have
vainly
trust
in
among
the
street
and
at
the
prayer
-
meeting
,
be
very
far
away
from
this
land
in
which
he
have
take
refuge
,
where
man
live
in
careless
abundance
,
know
and
need
nothing
of
that
trust
,
which
,
for
him
,
have
be
turn
to
bitterness
.
<EOS>
the
little
light
he
possess
spread
its
beam
so
narrowly
,
that
frustrated
belief
be
a
curtain
broad
enough
to
create
for
him
the
blackness
of
night
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
movement
after
the
shock
have
be
to
work
in
his
loom
;
and
he
go
on
with
this
unremittingly
,
never
ask
himself
why
,
now
he
be
come
to
Raveloe
,
he
work
far
on
into
the
night
to
finish
the
tale
of
Mrs.
Osgood
's
table
-
linen
sooner
than
she
expect
 
without
contemplate
beforehand
the
money
she
would
put
into
his
hand
for
the
work
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
weave
,
like
the
spider
,
from
pure
impulse
,
without
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
every
man
's
work
,
pursue
steadily
,
tend
in
this
way
to
become
an
end
in
itself
,
and
so
to
bridge
over
the
loveless
chasm
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
's
hand
satisfy
itself
with
throw
the
shuttle
,
and
his
eye
with
see
the
little
square
in
the
cloth
complete
themselves
under
his
effort
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
the
call
of
hunger
;
and
Silas
,
in
his
solitude
,
have
to
provide
his
own
breakfast
,
dinner
,
and
supper
,
to
fetch
his
own
water
from
the
well
,
and
put
his
own
kettle
on
the
fire
;
and
all
these
immediate
prompting
help
,
along
with
the
weaving
,
to
reduce
his
life
to
the
unquestioning
activity
of
a
spinning
insect
.
 
<EOS>
He
hate
the
thought
of
the
past
;
there
be
nothing
that
call
out
his
love
and
fellowship
toward
the
stranger
he
have
come
amongst
;
and
the
future
be
all
dark
,
for
there
be
no
Unseen
Love
that
care
for
him
.
<EOS>
thought
be
arrest
by
utter
bewilderment
,
now
its
old
narrow
pathway
be
closed
,
and
affection
seem
to
have
die
under
the
bruise
that
have
fall
on
its
keen
nerve
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
last
Mrs.
Osgood
's
table
-
linen
be
finish
,
and
Silas
be
pay
in
gold
.
 
<EOS>
His
earning
in
his
native
town
,
where
he
work
for
a
wholesale
dealer
,
have
be
after
a
low
rate
;
he
have
be
pay
weekly
,
and
of
his
weekly
earning
a
large
proportion
have
go
to
object
of
piety
and
charity
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
he
have
five
bright
guinea
put
into
his
hand
;
no
man
expect
a
share
of
them
,
and
he
love
no
man
that
he
should
offer
him
a
share
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
guinea
to
him
who
see
no
vista
beyond
countless
day
of
weaving
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
needless
for
him
to
ask
that
,
for
it
be
pleasant
to
him
to
feel
them
in
his
palm
,
and
look
at
their
bright
face
,
which
be
all
his
own
:
it
be
another
element
of
life
,
like
the
weaving
and
the
satisfaction
of
hunger
,
subsist
quite
aloof
from
the
life
of
belief
and
love
from
which
he
have
be
cut
off
.
<EOS>
the
weaver
's
hand
have
know
the
touch
of
hard
-
win
money
even
before
the
palm
have
grow
to
its
full
breadth
;
for
twenty
year
,
mysterious
money
have
stand
to
him
as
the
symbol
of
earthly
good
,
and
the
immediate
object
of
toil
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
seem
to
love
it
little
in
the
year
when
every
penny
have
its
purpose
for
him
;
for
he
love
the
_
purpose
_
then
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
when
all
purpose
be
go
,
that
habit
of
look
towards
the
money
and
grasp
it
with
a
sense
of
fulfil
effort
make
a
loam
that
be
deep
enough
for
the
seed
of
desire
;
and
as
Silas
walk
homeward
across
the
field
in
the
twilight
,
he
draw
out
the
money
and
think
it
be
bright
in
the
gathering
gloom
.
  
<EOS>
about
this
time
an
incident
happen
which
seem
to
open
a
possibility
of
some
fellowship
with
his
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
,
take
a
pair
of
shoe
to
be
mend
,
he
see
the
cobbler
's
wife
seat
by
the
fire
,
suffer
from
the
terrible
symptom
of
heart
-
disease
and
dropsy
,
which
he
have
witness
as
the
precursor
of
his
mother
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
a
rush
of
pity
at
the
mingled
sight
and
remembrance
,
and
,
recall
the
relief
his
mother
have
find
from
a
simple
preparation
of
foxglove
,
he
promise
Sally
Oates
to
bring
her
something
that
would
ease
her
,
since
the
doctor
do
her
no
good
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
office
of
charity
,
Silas
feel
,
for
the
first
time
since
he
have
come
to
Raveloe
,
a
sense
of
unity
between
his
past
and
present
life
,
which
may
have
be
the
beginning
of
his
rescue
from
the
insect
-
like
existence
into
which
his
nature
have
shrink
.
<EOS>
but
Sally
Oates
's
disease
have
raise
her
into
a
personage
of
much
interest
and
importance
among
the
neighbour
,
and
the
fact
of
her
have
find
relief
from
drink
Silas
Marner
's
"
stuff
"
become
a
matter
of
general
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
when
Doctor
Kimble
give
physic
,
it
be
natural
that
it
should
have
an
effect
;
but
when
a
weaver
,
who
come
from
nobody
know
where
,
work
wonder
with
a
bottle
of
brown
water
,
the
occult
character
of
the
process
be
evident
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
sort
of
thing
have
not
be
know
since
the
Wise
Woman
at
Tarley
die
;
and
she
have
charm
as
well
as
"
stuff
"
<EOS>
:
everybody
go
to
her
when
their
child
have
fit
.
<EOS>
Silas
Marner
must
be
a
person
of
the
same
sort
,
for
how
do
he
know
what
would
bring
back
Sally
Oates
's
breath
,
if
he
do
not
know
a
fine
sight
more
than
that
?
 
<EOS>
the
Wise
Woman
have
word
that
she
mutter
to
herself
,
so
that
you
could
not
hear
what
they
be
,
and
if
she
tie
a
bit
of
red
thread
round
the
child
's
toe
<EOS>
the
while
,
it
would
keep
off
the
water
in
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
woman
in
Raveloe
,
at
that
present
time
,
who
have
wear
one
of
the
Wise
Woman
's
little
bag
<EOS>
round
their
neck
,
and
,
in
consequence
,
have
never
have
an
idiot
child
,
as
Ann
Coulter
have
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
Marner
could
very
likely
do
as
much
,
and
more
;
and
now
it
be
all
clear
how
he
should
have
come
from
unknown
part
,
and
be
so
"
comical
-
looking
"
.
<EOS>
but
Sally
Oates
must
mind
and
not
tell
the
doctor
,
for
he
would
be
sure
to
set
his
face
against
Marner
:
he
be
always
angry
about
the
Wise
Woman
,
and
use
to
threaten
those
who
go
to
her
that
they
should
have
none
of
his
help
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
now
find
himself
and
his
cottage
suddenly
beset
by
mother
who
want
him
to
charm
away
the
whooping
-
cough
,
or
bring
back
the
milk
,
and
by
man
who
want
stuff
against
the
rheumatic
or
the
knot
in
the
hand
;
and
,
to
secure
themselves
against
a
refusal
,
the
applicant
bring
silver
in
their
palm
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
may
have
drive
a
profitable
trade
in
charm
as
well
as
in
his
small
list
of
drug
;
but
money
on
this
condition
be
no
temptation
to
him
:
he
have
never
know
an
impulse
towards
falsity
,
and
he
drive
one
after
another
away
with
grow
irritation
,
for
the
news
of
him
as
a
wise
man
have
spread
even
to
Tarley
,
and
it
be
long
before
people
cease
to
take
long
walk
for
the
sake
of
ask
his
aid
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
hope
in
his
wisdom
be
at
length
change
into
dread
,
for
no
one
<EOS>
believe
him
when
he
say
he
know
no
charm
and
could
work
no
cure
,
and
every
man
and
woman
who
have
an
accident
or
a
new
attack
after
apply
to
him
,
set
the
misfortune
down
to
Master
Marner
's
ill
-
will
and
irritated
glance
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
come
to
pass
that
his
movement
of
pity
towards
Sally
Oates
,
which
have
give
him
a
transient
sense
of
brotherhood
,
heighten
the
repulsion
between
him
and
his
neighbour
,
and
make
his
isolation
more
complete
.
  
<EOS>
gradually
the
guinea
,
the
crown
,
and
the
half
-
crown
grow
to
a
heap
,
and
Marner
draw
less
and
less
for
his
own
want
,
try
to
solve
the
problem
of
keep
himself
strong
enough
to
work
sixteen
hour
a
-
day
on
as
small
an
outlay
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
have
not
man
,
shut
up
in
solitary
imprisonment
,
find
an
interest
in
mark
the
moment
by
straight
stroke
of
a
certain
length
on
the
wall
,
until
the
growth
of
the
sum
of
straight
stroke
,
arrange
in
triangle
,
have
become
a
master
purpose
?
 
<EOS>
do
we
not
wile
away
moment
of
inanity
or
fatigue
wait
by
repeat
some
trivial
movement
or
sound
,
until
the
repetition
have
breed
a
want
,
which
be
incipient
habit
?
 
<EOS>
that
will
help
us
to
understand
how
the
love
of
accumulate
money
grow
an
absorb
passion
in
man
whose
imagination
,
even
in
the
very
beginning
of
their
hoard
,
show
them
no
purpose
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
Marner
want
the
heap
of
ten
to
grow
into
a
square
,
and
then
into
a
large
square
;
and
every
add
guinea
,
while
it
be
itself
a
satisfaction
,
breed
a
new
desire
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
strange
world
,
make
a
hopeless
riddle
to
him
,
he
may
,
if
he
have
have
a
less
intense
nature
,
have
sit
weaving
,
weave
 
look
towards
the
end
of
his
pattern
,
or
towards
the
end
of
his
web
,
till
he
forget
the
riddle
,
and
everything
else
but
his
immediate
sensation
;
but
the
money
have
come
to
mark
off
his
weaving
into
period
,
and
the
money
not
only
grow
,
but
it
remain
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
to
think
it
be
conscious
of
him
,
as
his
loom
be
,
and
he
would
on
no
account
have
exchange
those
coin
,
which
have
become
his
familiar
,
for
other
coin
with
unknown
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
handle
them
,
he
count
them
,
till
their
form
and
colour
be
like
the
satisfaction
of
a
thirst
to
him
;
but
it
be
only
in
the
night
,
when
his
work
be
do
,
that
he
draw
them
out
to
enjoy
their
companionship
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
take
up
some
brick
in
his
floor
underneath
his
loom
,
and
here
he
have
make
a
hole
in
which
he
set
the
iron
pot
that
contain
his
guinea
and
silver
coin
,
cover
the
brick
with
sand
whenever
he
replace
them
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
the
idea
of
be
rob
present
itself
often
or
strongly
to
his
mind
:
<EOS>
hoarding
be
common
in
country
district
in
those
day
;
there
be
old
labourer
in
the
parish
of
Raveloe
who
be
know
to
have
their
saving
by
them
,
probably
inside
their
flock
-
bed
;
but
their
rustic
neighbour
,
though
not
all
of
them
as
honest
as
their
ancestor
in
the
day
of
King
Alfred
,
have
not
imagination
bold
enough
to
lay
a
plan
of
burglary
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
they
have
spend
the
money
in
their
own
village
without
betray
themselves
?
 
<EOS>
They
would
be
oblige
to
"
run
away
"
 
a
course
as
dark
and
dubious
as
a
balloon
journey
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
year
after
year
,
Silas
Marner
have
live
in
this
solitude
,
his
guinea
rise
in
the
iron
pot
,
and
his
life
narrow
and
harden
itself
more
and
more
into
a
mere
pulsation
of
desire
and
satisfaction
that
have
no
relation
to
any
other
being
.
 
<EOS>
His
life
have
reduce
itself
to
the
function
of
weaving
and
hoarding
,
without
any
contemplation
of
an
end
towards
which
the
function
tend
.
 
<EOS>
the
same
sort
of
process
have
perhaps
be
undergo
by
wise
man
,
when
they
have
be
cut
off
from
faith
and
love
 
only
,
instead
of
a
loom
and
a
heap
of
guinea
,
they
have
have
some
erudite
research
,
some
ingenious
project
,
or
some
well
-
knit
theory
.
 
<EOS>
Strangely
Marner
's
face
and
figure
shrink
and
bend
themselves
into
a
constant
mechanical
relation
to
the
object
of
his
life
,
so
that
he
produce
the
same
sort
of
impression
as
a
handle
or
a
crooked
tube
,
which
have
no
meaning
stand
apart
.
 
<EOS>
the
prominent
eye
that
use
to
look
trust
and
dreamy
,
now
look
as
if
they
have
be
make
to
see
only
one
kind
of
thing
that
be
very
small
,
like
tiny
grain
,
for
which
they
hunt
everywhere
:
and
he
be
so
withered
and
yellow
,
that
,
though
he
be
not
yet
forty
,
the
child
always
call
him
"
Old
Master
Marner
"
.
  
<EOS>
yet
even
in
this
stage
of
wither
a
little
incident
happen
,
which
show
that
the
sap
of
affection
be
not
all
go
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
his
daily
task
to
fetch
his
water
from
a
well
a
couple
of
field
off
,
and
for
this
purpose
,
ever
since
he
come
to
Raveloe
,
he
have
have
a
brown
earthenware
pot
,
which
he
hold
as
his
most
precious
utensil
among
the
very
few
convenience
he
have
grant
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
his
companion
for
twelve
year
,
always
stand
on
the
same
spot
,
always
lend
its
handle
to
him
in
the
early
morning
,
so
that
its
form
have
an
expression
for
him
of
willing
helpfulness
,
and
the
impress
of
its
handle
on
his
palm
give
a
satisfaction
mingle
with
that
of
have
the
fresh
clear
water
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
as
he
be
return
from
the
well
,
he
stumble
against
the
step
of
the
stile
,
and
his
brown
pot
,
fall
with
force
against
the
stone
that
overarch
the
ditch
below
him
,
be
break
in
three
piece
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
pick
up
the
piece
and
carry
them
home
with
grief
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
the
brown
pot
could
never
be
of
use
to
him
any
more
,
but
he
stick
the
bit
together
and
prop
the
ruin
in
its
old
place
for
a
memorial
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
history
of
Silas
Marner
,
until
the
fifteenth
year
after
he
come
to
Raveloe
.
 
<EOS>
the
livelong
day
he
sit
in
his
loom
,
his
ear
fill
with
its
monotony
,
his
eye
bend
close
down
on
the
slow
growth
of
sameness
in
the
brownish
web
,
his
muscle
move
with
such
even
repetition
that
their
pause
seem
almost
as
much
a
constraint
as
the
holding
of
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
night
come
his
revelry
:
at
night
he
close
his
shutter
,
and
make
fast
his
door
,
and
draw
forth
his
gold
.
<EOS>
long
ago
the
heap
of
coin
have
become
too
large
for
the
iron
pot
to
hold
them
,
and
he
have
make
for
them
two
thick
leather
bag
,
which
waste
no
room
in
their
resting
-
place
,
but
lend
themselves
flexibly
to
every
corner
.
 
<EOS>
how
the
guinea
shine
as
they
come
pour
out
of
the
dark
leather
mouth
!
 
<EOS>
the
silver
bore
no
large
proportion
in
amount
to
the
gold
,
because
the
long
piece
of
linen
which
form
his
chief
work
be
always
partly
pay
for
in
gold
,
and
out
of
the
silver
he
supply
his
own
bodily
want
,
choose
always
the
shilling
and
sixpence
to
spend
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
He
love
the
guinea
best
,
but
he
would
not
change
the
silver
 
the
crown
and
half
-
crown
that
be
his
own
earning
,
begotten
by
his
labour
;
he
love
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
spread
them
out
in
heap
and
bathe
his
hand
in
them
;
then
he
count
them
and
set
them
up
in
regular
pile
,
and
feel
their
rounded
outline
between
his
thumb
and
finger
,
and
think
fondly
of
the
guinea
that
be
only
half
-
earn
by
the
work
in
his
loom
,
as
if
they
have
be
unborn
child
 
thought
of
the
guinea
that
be
come
slowly
through
the
come
year
,
through
all
his
life
,
which
spread
far
away
before
him
,
the
end
quite
hide
by
countless
day
of
weaving
.
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
his
thought
be
still
with
his
loom
and
his
money
when
he
make
his
journey
through
the
field
and
the
lane
to
fetch
and
carry
home
his
work
,
so
that
his
step
never
wander
to
the
hedge
-
bank
and
the
lane
-
side
in
search
of
the
once
familiar
herb
:
these
too
belong
to
the
past
,
from
which
his
life
have
shrink
away
,
like
a
rivulet
that
have
sink
far
down
from
the
grassy
fringe
of
its
old
breadth
into
a
little
shivering
thread
,
that
cut
a
groove
for
itself
in
the
barren
sand
.
  
<EOS>
but
about
the
Christmas
of
that
fifteenth
year
,
a
second
great
change
come
over
Marner
's
life
,
and
his
history
become
blent
in
a
singular
manner
with
the
life
of
his
neighbour
.
    
<EOS>
the
great
man
in
Raveloe
be
Squire
Cass
,
who
live
in
the
large
red
house
with
the
handsome
flight
of
stone
step
in
front
and
the
high
stable
behind
it
,
nearly
opposite
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
only
one
among
several
land
parishioner
,
but
he
alone
be
honour
with
the
title
of
Squire
;
for
though
Mr.
Osgood
's
family
be
also
understand
to
be
of
timeless
origin
 
the
Raveloe
imagination
have
never
venture
back
to
that
fearful
blank
when
there
be
no
Osgoods
 
still
,
he
merely
own
the
farm
he
occupy
;
whereas
Squire
Cass
have
a
tenant
or
two
,
who
complain
of
the
game
to
him
quite
as
if
he
have
be
a
lord
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
still
that
glorious
war
-
time
which
be
feel
to
be
a
peculiar
favour
of
Providence
towards
the
landed
interest
,
and
the
fall
of
price
have
not
yet
come
to
carry
the
race
of
small
squire
and
yeoman
down
that
road
to
ruin
for
which
extravagant
habit
and
bad
husbandry
be
plentifully
anoint
their
wheel
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
speak
now
in
relation
to
Raveloe
and
the
parish
that
resemble
it
;
for
our
old
-
fashioned
country
life
have
many
different
aspect
,
as
all
life
must
have
when
it
be
spread
over
a
various
surface
,
and
breathe
on
variously
by
multitudinous
current
,
from
the
wind
of
heaven
to
the
thought
of
man
,
which
be
for
ever
move
and
cross
each
other
with
incalculable
result
.
 
<EOS>
Raveloe
lie
low
among
the
bushy
tree
and
the
rut
lane
,
aloof
from
the
current
of
industrial
energy
and
Puritan
earnestness
:
the
rich
ate
and
drink
freely
,
accept
gout
and
apoplexy
as
thing
that
run
mysteriously
in
respectable
family
,
and
the
poor
thought
that
the
rich
be
entirely
in
the
right
of
it
to
lead
a
jolly
life
;
besides
,
their
feasting
cause
a
multiplication
of
ort
,
which
be
the
heirloom
of
the
poor
.
 
<EOS>
Betty
Jay
scent
the
boiling
of
Squire
Cass
's
ham
,
but
her
longing
be
arrest
by
the
unctuous
liquor
in
which
they
be
boil
;
and
when
the
season
bring
round
the
great
merry
-
making
,
they
be
regard
on
all
hand
as
a
fine
thing
for
the
poor
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
Raveloe
feast
be
like
the
round
of
beef
and
the
barrel
of
ale
 
<EOS>
they
be
on
a
large
scale
,
and
last
a
good
while
,
especially
in
the
winter
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
after
lady
have
pack
up
their
good
gown
and
top
-
knot
in
bandboxes
,
and
have
incur
the
risk
of
ford
stream
on
pillion
with
the
precious
burden
in
rainy
or
snowy
weather
,
when
there
be
no
know
how
high
the
water
would
rise
,
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
they
look
forward
to
a
brief
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
ground
it
be
always
contrive
in
the
dark
season
,
when
there
be
little
work
to
be
do
,
and
the
hour
be
long
,
that
several
neighbour
should
keep
open
house
in
succession
.
<EOS>
so
soon
as
Squire
Cass
's
stand
dish
diminish
in
plenty
and
freshness
,
his
guest
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
walk
a
little
high
up
the
village
to
Mr.
Osgood
's
,
at
the
Orchards
,
and
they
find
hams
and
chine
uncut
,
pork
-
pie
with
the
scent
of
the
fire
in
them
,
spin
butter
in
all
its
freshness
 
everything
,
in
fact
,
that
appetite
at
leisure
could
desire
,
in
perhaps
great
perfection
,
though
not
in
great
abundance
,
than
at
Squire
Cass
's
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
Squire
's
wife
have
die
long
ago
,
and
the
Red
House
be
without
that
presence
of
the
wife
and
mother
which
be
the
fountain
of
wholesome
love
and
fear
in
parlour
and
kitchen
;
and
this
help
to
account
not
only
for
there
be
more
profusion
than
finished
excellence
in
the
holiday
provision
,
but
also
for
the
frequency
with
which
the
proud
Squire
condescend
to
preside
in
the
parlour
of
the
Rainbow
rather
than
under
the
shadow
of
his
own
dark
wainscot
;
perhaps
,
also
,
for
the
fact
that
his
son
have
turn
out
rather
ill
.
 
<EOS>
Raveloe
be
not
a
place
where
moral
censure
be
severe
,
but
it
be
think
a
weakness
in
the
Squire
that
he
have
keep
all
his
son
at
home
in
idleness
;
and
though
some
licence
be
to
be
allow
to
young
man
whose
father
could
afford
it
,
people
shake
their
head
at
the
course
of
the
second
son
,
Dunstan
,
commonly
call
Dunsey
Cass
,
whose
taste
for
swopping
and
betting
may
turn
out
to
be
a
sowing
of
something
bad
than
wild
oat
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
the
neighbour
say
,
it
be
no
matter
what
become
of
Dunsey
 
<EOS>
a
spiteful
jeering
fellow
,
who
seem
to
enjoy
his
drink
the
more
when
other
people
go
dry
 
always
provide
that
his
doing
do
not
bring
trouble
on
a
family
like
Squire
Cass
's
,
with
a
monument
in
the
church
,
and
tankard
old
than
King
George
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
be
a
thousand
pity
if
Mr.
Godfrey
,
the
eld
,
a
fine
open
-
faced
good
-
natured
young
man
who
be
to
come
into
the
land
some
day
,
should
take
to
go
along
the
same
road
with
his
brother
,
as
he
have
seem
to
do
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
go
on
in
that
way
,
he
would
lose
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
;
for
it
be
well
known
that
she
have
look
very
shyly
on
him
ever
since
last
Whitsuntide
twelvemonth
,
when
there
be
so
much
talk
about
his
be
away
from
home
day
and
day
together
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
wrong
,
more
than
common
 
<EOS>
that
be
quite
clear
;
for
Mr.
Godfrey
do
not
look
half
so
fresh
-
coloured
and
open
as
he
use
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
time
everybody
be
say
,
what
a
handsome
couple
<EOS>
he
and
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
would
make
!
<EOS>
and
if
she
could
come
to
be
mistress
at
the
Red
House
,
there
would
be
a
fine
change
,
for
the
Lammeters
have
be
bring
up
in
that
way
,
that
they
never
suffer
a
pinch
of
salt
to
be
waste
,
and
yet
everybody
in
their
household
have
of
the
good
,
accord
to
his
place
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
would
be
a
saving
to
the
old
Squire
,
if
she
never
bring
a
penny
to
her
fortune
;
for
it
be
to
be
fear
that
,
notwithstanding
his
incoming
,
there
be
more
hole
in
his
pocket
than
the
one
where
he
put
his
own
hand
in
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
Mr.
Godfrey
do
not
turn
over
a
new
leaf
,
he
may
say
"
good
-
bye
"
to
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
once
hopeful
Godfrey
who
be
stand
,
with
his
hand
in
his
side
-
pocket
and
his
back
to
the
fire
,
in
the
dark
wainscoted
parlour
,
one
late
November
afternoon
in
that
fifteenth
year
of
Silas
Marner
's
life
at
Raveloe
.
 
<EOS>
the
fading
grey
light
fall
dimly
on
the
wall
decorate
with
gun

whip

and
fox

brush
,
on
coat
and
hat
fling
on
the
chair
,
on
tankard
send
forth
a
scent
of
flat
ale
,
and
on
a
half
-
choke
fire
,
with
pipe
prop
up
in
the
chimney

corner
:
sign
of
a
domestic
life
destitute
of
any
hallow
charm
,
with
which
the
look
of
gloomy
vexation
on
Godfrey
's
blond
face
be
in
sad
accordance
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
wait
and
listen
for
some
one
's
approach
,
and
presently
the
sound
of
a
heavy
step
,
with
an
accompany
whistle
,
be
hear
across
the
large
empty
entrance
-
hall
.

the

and
a
thick

heavy

enter

with
the
flushed
face
and
the
gratuitously
elated
bearing
which
mark
the
first
stage
of
intoxication
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Dunsey
,
and
at
the
sight
of
him
Godfrey
's
face
part
with
some
of
its
gloom
to
take
on
the
more
active
expression
of
hatred
.
 
<EOS>
the
handsome
brown
spaniel

Dunsey
perceive
that
he
have
overshoot
his
mark
,

that
there
be
a
point
at
which
even
the
hesitating
Godfrey
may
be
drive
into
decision

he
say
,
with
an
air
of
unconcern
    
"

as
you
please

I
will
have
a
draught
of
ale
first

ring
the

throw
himself
across
two
chair

seat
with
the
handle

his
whip

Godfrey
stand
,
still
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
uneasily
move
his
finger
among
the
content
of
his
side
-
pocket
,
and
look
at
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
that
big
muscular
frame
of
his
hold
plenty
of
animal
courage

help
him
to
no
decision
when
the
danger
to
be
brave
be
such
as
could
neither
be
knock
down
nor
throttle

<EOS>
His
natural
irresolution
and
moral
cowardice
be
exaggerate
by
a
position
in
which
dread
consequence
seem
to
press
equally
on
all
side
,

his
irritation
have
no
sooner
provoke
him
to
defy
Dunstan
and
anticipate
all
possible
betrayal
,
than
the
misery
he
must
bring
on
himself
by
such
a
step
seem
more
unendurable
to
him
than
the
present
evil
.
 
<EOS>
the
result
of
confession
be
not
contingent
,
they
be
certain
;
whereas
betrayal
be
not
certain

<EOS>
from
the
near
vision
of
that
certainty
he
fall
back
on
suspense
and
vacillation
with
a
sense
of
repose

<EOS>
the
disinherited
son
of
a
small
squire
,
equally
disinclined
to
dig

to
beg

be
almost
as
helpless
as
an
uprooted
tree
,
which
,
by
the
favour
of
earth

sky
,
have
grow
to
a
handsome
bulk
on
the
spot
where
it

shoot
upward

<EOS>
perhaps
it
would
have
be
possible
to
think
of
dig
with
some
cheerfulness
if
Nancy
Lammeter
be
to
be
win
on
those
term
;
but
,
since
he
must
irrevocably
lose
_
<EOS>
her
_
as
well
as
the
inheritance
,
and
must
break
every
tie
<EOS>
but
the
one
that
degrade
him
and
leave
him
without
motive
for
try
to
recover
his
well
self
,
he
could
imagine
no
future
for
himself
on
the
other
side
of
confession

<EOS>
that
of
"
'
list
for
a
soldier

the
most
desperate
step
,
short
of
suicide
,
in
the
eye
of
respectable
family

<EOS>
no
!
 
<EOS>
he
would
rather
trust
to
casualty
than
to
his
own
resolve
 
rather
go
on
sit
at
the
feast
,
and
sip
the
wine
he
love
,
though
with
the
sword
hang
over
him
and
terror
in
his
heart
,
than
rush
away
into
the
cold
darkness
where
there
be
no
pleasure
leave
.
 
<EOS>
the
utmost
concession
to
Dunstan
about
the
horse
begin
to
seem
easy
,
compare
with
the
fulfilment
of
his
own
threat

his
pride
would
not
let
him
recommence
the
conversation
otherwise

by
continue
the
quarrel

wait
for
this

my

"
  
<EOS>
with
that
,
Dunstan
slam
the
door
behind
him
,
and
leave
Godfrey
to
that
bitter
rumination
on
his
personal
circumstance
which
be
now
unbroken
from
day
to
day
save
by
the
excitement
of
sporting
,
drinking
,
card

playing
,
or
the
rarer
and
less
oblivious
pleasure
of
see
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
.
 
<EOS>
the
subtle
and
varied
pain
spring
from
the
high
sensibility
that
accompany
high
culture
,
be
perhaps
less
pitiable
than
that
dreary
absence
of
impersonal
enjoyment
and
consolation
which
leave
ruder
mind
to
the
perpetual
urgent
companionship
of
their
own
griefs
and
discontent
.
 
<EOS>
the
life
of
those
rural
forefather
,
whom
we
be
apt
to
think
very
prosaic
figure
 
<EOS>
man
whose
only
work
be
to
ride
round
their

get
heavy
and
heavier
in

and
who
pass
the
rest
of
their
day
in
the
half
-
listless
gratification
of

dull
by
monotony
 
have
a
certain
pathos
in
them
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
calamity
come
to
_
them
_
too
,
and
their
early
error
carry
hard
consequence
:
perhaps
the
love
of
some
sweet
maiden
,
the
image
of
purity
,
order
,
and
calm
,
have
open
their
eye
to
the
vision
of
a
life
in
which
the
day
would
not
seem
too
long
,
even
without
rioting
;
but
the
maiden
be
lose
,
and
the
vision
pass
away
,
and
then
what
be
leave
to
them
,
especially
when
they
have
become
too
heavy
for
the
hunt
,
or
for
carry
a
gun
over
the
furrow
,
but
to
drink
and
get
merry
,
or
to
drink
and
get
angry
,
so
that
they
may
be
independent
of
variety
,
and
say
over
again
with
eager
emphasis
the
thing
they
have
say
already
any
time
that
twelvemonth
?
<EOS>
assuredly
,
among
these
flush
and
dull
-
eyed
man
there
be
some
whom
 
thank
to
their
native
human
-
kindness
 
even
riot
could
never
drive
into
brutality
;
man
who
,
when
their
cheek
be
fresh
,
have
feel
the
keen
point
of
sorrow
or
remorse
,
have
be
pierce
by
the
reed
they
lean
on
,
or
have
lightly
put
their
limb
in
fetter
from
which
no
struggle
could
loose
them
;
and
under
these
sad
circumstance
,
common
to
us
all
,
their
thought
could
find
no
rest
-
place
outside
the
ever
-
trodden
round
of
their
own
petty
history
.
  
<EOS>
that
,
at
least
,
be
the
condition
of
Godfrey
Cass
in
this
six
-
and
-
twentieth
year
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
a
movement
of
compunction
,
help
by
those
small
indefinable
influence
which
every
personal
relation
exert
on
a
pliant
nature
,
have
urge
him
into
a
secret
marriage
,
which
be
a
blight
on
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
ugly
story
of
low
passion
,
delusion
,
and
wake
from
delusion
,
which
need
not
to
be
drag
from
the
privacy
of
Godfrey
's
bitter
memory
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
long
know
that
the
delusion
be
partly
due
to
a
trap
lay
for
him
by
Dunstan
,
who
see
in
his
brother
's
degrade
marriage
the
mean
of
gratify
at
once
his
jealous
hate
and
his
cupidity
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
Godfrey
could
have
feel
himself
simply
a
victim
,
the
iron
bit
that
destiny
have
put
into
his
mouth
would
have
chafe
him
less
intolerably
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
curse
he
mutter
half
aloud
when
he
be
alone
have
have
no
other
object
than
Dunstan
's
diabolical
cunning
,
he
may
have
shrink
less
from
the
consequence
of
avowal
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
something
else
to
curse
 
his
own
vicious
folly
,
which
now
seem
as
mad
and
unaccountable
to
him
as
almost
all
our
folly
and
vice
do
when
their
prompting
have
long
pass
away
.
 
<EOS>
for
four
year
he
have
think
of
Nancy
Lammeter
,
and
woo
her
with
tacit
patient
worship
,
as
the
woman
who
make
him
think
of
the
future
with
joy
:
she
would
be
his
wife
,
and
would
make
home
lovely
to
him
,
as
his
father
's
home
have
never
be
;
and
it
would
be
easy
,
when
she
be
always
near
,
to
shake
off
those
foolish
habit
that
be
no
pleasure
,
but
only
a
feverish
way
of
annul
vacancy
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
's
be
an
essentially
domestic
nature
,
breed
up
in
a
home
where
the
hearth
have
no
smile
,
and
where
the
daily
habit
be
not
chastise
by
the
presence
of
household
order
.
 
<EOS>
His
easy
disposition
make
him
fall
in
unresistingly
with
the
family
course
,
but
the
need
of
some
tender
permanent
affection
,
the
longing
for
some
influence
that
would
make
the
good
he
prefer
easy
to
pursue
,
cause
the
neatness
,
purity
,
and
liberal
orderliness
of
the
Lammeter
household
,
sun
by
the
smile
of
Nancy
,
to
seem
like
those
fresh
bright
hour
of
the
morning
when
temptation
go
to
sleep
and
leave
the
ear
open
to
the
voice
of
the
good
angel
,
invite
to
industry
,
sobriety
,
and
peace
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
the
hope
of
this
paradise
have
not
be
enough
to
save
him
from
a
course
which
shut
him
out
of
it
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
keep
fast
hold
of
the
strong
silken
rope
by
which
Nancy
would
have
draw
him
safe
to
the
green
bank
where
it
be
easy
to
step
firmly
,
he
have
let
himself
be
drag
back
into
mud
and
slime
,
in
which
it
be
useless
to
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
make
tie
for
himself
which
rob
him
of
all
wholesome
motive
,
and
be
a
constant
exasperation
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
there
be
one
position
bad
than
the
present
:
it
be
the
position
he
would
be
in
when
the
ugly
secret
be
disclose
;
and
the
desire
that
continually
triumph
over
every
other
be
that
of
ward
off
the
evil
day
,
when
he
would
have
to
bear
the
consequence
of
his
father
's
violent
resentment
for
the
wound
inflict
on
his
family
pride
 
would
have
,
perhaps
,
to
turn
his
back
on
that
hereditary
ease
and
dignity
which
,
after
all
,
be
a
sort
of
reason
for
living
,
and
would
carry
with
him
the
certainty
that
he
be
banish
for
ever
from
the
sight
and
esteem
of
Nancy
Lammeter
.
 
<EOS>
the
long
the
interval
,
the
more
chance
there
be
of
deliverance
from
some
,
at
least
,
of
the
hateful
consequence
to
which
he
have
sell
himself
;
the
more
opportunity
remain
for
him
to
snatch
the
strange
gratification
of
see
Nancy
,
and
gather
some
faint
indication
of
her
linger
regard
.
 
<EOS>
towards
this
gratification
he
be
impel
,
fitfully
,
every
now
and
then
,
after
have
pass
week
in
which
he
have
avoid
her
as
the
far
-
off
bright
-
winged
prize
that
only
make
him
spring
forward
and
find
his
chain
all
the
more
galling
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
those
fit
of
yearning
be
on
him
now
,
and
it
would
have
be
strong
enough
to
have
persuade
him
to
trust
Wildfire
to
Dunstan
rather
than
disappoint
the
yearning
,
even
if
he
have
not
have
another
reason
for
his
disinclination
towards
the
morrow
's
hunt
.
 
<EOS>
that
other
reason
be
the
fact
that
the
morning
's
meet
be
near
Batherley
,
the
market
-
town
where
the
unhappy
woman
live
,
whose
image
become
more
odious
to
him
every
day
;
and
to
his
thought
the
whole
vicinage
be
haunt
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
yoke
a
man
create
for
himself
by
wrong
-
doing
will
breed
hate
in
the
kindly
nature
;
and
the
good
-
humour
,
affectionate
-
hearted
Godfrey
Cass
be
fast
become
a
bitter
man
,
visit
by
cruel
wish
,
that
seem
to
enter
,
and
depart
,
and
enter
again
,
like
demon
who
have
find
in
him
a
ready
-
garnished
home
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
he
to
do
this
evening
to
pass
the
time
?
 
<EOS>
He
may
as
well
go
to
the
Rainbow
,
and
hear
the
talk
about
the
cock
-
fighting
<EOS>
:
everybody
be
there
,
and
what
else
be
there
to
be
do
?
 
<EOS>
though
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
do
not
care
a
button
for
cock
-
fighting
.
<EOS>
Snuff
,
the
brown
spaniel
,
who
have
place
herself
in
front
of
him
,
and
have
be
watch
him
for
some
time
,
now
jump
up
in
impatience
for
the
expected
caress
.
<EOS>
but
Godfrey
thrust
her
away
without
look
at
her
,
and
leave
the
room
,
follow
humbly
by
the
unresente
Snuff
 
perhaps
because
she
see
no
other
career
open
to
her
.
    
<EOS>
Dunstan
Cass
,
set
off
in
the
raw
morning
,
at
the
judiciously
quiet
pace
of
a
man
who
be
oblige
to
ride
to
cover
on
his
hunter
,
have
to
take
his
way
along
the
lane
which
,
at
its
farth
extremity
,
pass
by
the
piece
of
unenclosed
ground
call
the
Stone
-
pit
,
where
stand
the
cottage
,
once
a
stone
-
cutter
's
shed
,
now
for
fifteen
year
inhabit
by
Silas
Marner
.
 
<EOS>
the
spot
look
very
dreary
at
this
season
,
with
the
moist
trodden
clay
about
it
,
and
the
red
,
muddy
water
high
up
in
the
desert
quarry
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
Dunstan
's
first
thought
as
he
approach
it
;
the
second
be
,
that
the
old
fool
of
a
weaver
,
whose
loom
he
hear
rattle
already
,
have
a
great
deal
of
money
hide
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
he
,
Dunstan
Cass
,
who
have
often
hear
talk
of
Marner
's
miserliness
,
have
never
think
of
suggest
to
Godfrey
that
he
should
frighten
or
persuade
the
old
fellow
into
lend
the
money
on
the
excellent
security
of
the
young
Squire
's
prospect
?
 
<EOS>
the
resource
occur
to
him
now
as
so
easy
and
agreeable
,
especially
as
Marner
's
hoard
be
likely
to
be
large
enough
to
leave
Godfrey
a
handsome
surplus
beyond
his
immediate
need
,
and
enable
him
to
accommodate
his
faithful
brother
,
that
he
have
almost
turn
the
horse
's
head
towards
home
again
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
would
be
ready
enough
to
accept
the
suggestion
:
he
would
snatch
eagerly
at
a
plan
that
may
save
him
from
part
with
Wildfire
.
<EOS>
but
when
Dunstan
's
meditation
reach
this
point
,
the
inclination
to
go
on
grew
strong
and
prevail
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
want
to
give
Godfrey
that
pleasure
:
he
prefer
that
Master
Godfrey
should
be
vex
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
Dunstan
enjoy
the
self
-
important
consciousness
of
have
a
horse
to
sell
,
and
the
opportunity
of
drive
a
bargain
,
swaggering
,
and
possibly
take
somebody
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
have
all
the
satisfaction
attendant
on
sell
his
brother
's
horse
,
and
not
the
less
have
the
further
satisfaction
of
set
Godfrey
to
borrow
Marner
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
ride
on
to
cover
.
  
<EOS>
Bryce
and
Keating
be
there
,
as
Dunstan
be
quite
sure
they
would
be
 
<EOS>
he
be
such
a
lucky
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heyday
!
"
 
<EOS>
say
Bryce
,
who
have
long
have
his
eye
on
Wildfire
<EOS>
,
"
you
be
on
your

how
be
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
have
swap
with
him
,
"
say
Dunstan
,
whose
delight
in
lying
,
grandly
independent
of
utility
,
be
not
to
be
diminish
by
the
likelihood
that
his
hearer
would
not
believe
him
 
"
Wildfire
's
mine
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
 
<EOS>
have
he
swap
with
you
for
that
big
-
boned
hack
of
yours
?
"
<EOS>
say
Bryce
,
quite
aware
that
he
should
get
another
lie
in
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
there
be
a
little
account
between
us
,
"
say
Dunsey
,
carelessly
,
"
and
Wildfire
make
it
even
.
 
<EOS>
I
accommodate
him
by
take
the
horse
,
though
it
be
against
my
will
,
for
I
would
get
an
itch
for
a
mare
o
'
<EOS>
Jortin
's
 
as
rare
<EOS>
a
bit
o
'
blood
<EOS>
as
ever
you
throw
your
leg
across
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
keep
Wildfire
,
now
I
have
get
him
,
though
I
would
a
bid
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
for
him
the
other
day
,
from
a
man
over
at
Flitton
 
<EOS>
he
be
buy
for
Lord
Cromleck
 
a
fellow
with
a
cast
in
his
eye
,
and
a
green
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
mean
to
stick
to
Wildfire
:
I
shall
not
get
a
well
at
a
fence
in
a
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
the
mare
's
get
more
blood
,
but
she
be
a
bit
too
weak
in
the
hind
-
quarter
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bryce
of
course
divine
that
Dunstan
want
to
sell
the
horse
,
and
Dunstan
know
that
he
divine
it
<EOS>
(
horse
-
dealing
be
only
one
of
many
human
transaction
carry
on
in
this
ingenious
manner
)
;
and
they
both
consider
that
the
bargain
be
in
its
first
stage
,
when
Bryce
reply
ironically
    
"
I
wonder
at
that
now
<EOS>
;
I
wonder
you
mean
to
keep
him
;
for
I
never
hear
of
a
man
who
do
not
want
to
sell
his
horse
get
a
bid
of
half
as
much
again
as
the
horse
be
worth
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
lucky
if
you
get
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Keating
ride
up
now
,
and
the
transaction
become
more
complicated
.
<EOS>
It
end
in
the
purchase
of
the
horse
by
Bryce
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
,
to
be
pay
on
the
delivery
of
Wildfire
,
safe
and
sound
,
at
the
Batherley
stable
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
occur
to
dunsey
that
it
may
be
wise
for
him
to
give
up
the
day
's
hunting
,
proceed
at
once
to
Batherley
,
and
,
have
wait
for
Bryce
's
return
,
hire
a
horse
to
carry
him
home
with
the
money
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
inclination
for
a
run
,
encourage
by
confidence
in
his
luck
,
and
by
a
draught
of
brandy
from
his
pocket
-
pistol
at
the
conclusion
of
the
bargain
,
be
not
easy
to
overcome
,
especially
with
a
horse
under
him
that
would
take
the
fence
to
the
admiration
of
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
,
however
,
take
one
fence
too
many
,
and
get
his
horse
pierce
with
a
hedge
-
stake
.
<EOS>
His
own
ill
-
favour
person
,
which
be
quite
unmarketable
,
escape
without
injury
;
but
poor
Wildfire
,
unconscious
of
his
price
,
turn
on
his
flank
and
painfully
pant
his
last
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
that
Dunstan
,
a
short
time
before
,
have
have
to
get
down
to
arrange
his
stirrup
,
have
mutter
a
good
many
curse
at
this
interruption
,
which
have
throw
him
in
the
rear
of
the
hunt
near
the
moment
of
glory
,
and
under
this
exasperation
have
take
the
fence
more
blindly
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
soon
have
be
up
with
the
hound
again
,
when
the
fatal
accident
happen
;
and
hence
he
be
between
eager
rider
in
advance
,
not
trouble
themselves
about
what
happen
behind
them
,
and
far
-
off
straggler
,
who
be
as
likely
as
not
to
pass
quite
aloof
from
the
line
of
road
in
which
Wildfire
have
fall
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
,
whose
nature
it
be
to
care
more
for
immediate
annoyance
than
for
remote
consequence
,
no
sooner
recover
his
leg
,
and
see
that
it
be
all
over
with
Wildfire
,
than
he
feel
a
satisfaction
at
the
absence
of
witness
to
a
position
which
no
swaggering
could
make
enviable
.
<EOS>
reinforce
himself
,
after
his
shake
,
with
a
little
brandy
and
much
swearing
,
he
walk
as
fast
as
he
could
to
a
coppice
on
his
right
hand
,
through
which
it
occur
to
him
that
he
could
make
his
way
to
Batherley
without
danger
of
encounter
any
member
of
the
hunt
.
<EOS>
His
first
intention
be
to
hire
a
horse
there
and
ride
home
forthwith
,
for
to
walk
many
mile
without
a
gun
in
his
hand
,
and
along
an
ordinary
road
,
be
as
much
out
of
the
question
to
him
as
to
other
spirited
young
man
of
his
kind
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
much
mind
about
take
the
bad
news
to
Godfrey
,
for
he
have
to
offer
him
at
the
same
time
the
resource
of
Marner
's
money
;
and
if
Godfrey
kick
,
as
he
always
do
,
at
the
notion
of
make
a
fresh
debt
from
which
he
himself
get
the
small
share
of
advantage
,
why
,
he
would
not
kick
long
:
<EOS>
Dunstan
feel
sure
he
could
worry
Godfrey
into
anything
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
Marner
's
money
keep
grow
in
vividness
,
now
the
want
of
it
have
become
immediate
;
the
prospect
of
have
to
make
his
appearance
with
the
muddy
boot
of
a
pedestrian
at
Batherley
,
and
to
encounter
the
grin
query
of
stableman
,
stand
unpleasantly
in
the
way
of
his
impatience
to
be
back
at
Raveloe
and
carry
out
his
felicitous
plan
;
and
a
casual
visitation
of
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
,
as
he
be
ruminate
,
awaken
his
memory
to
the
fact
that
the
two
or
three
small
coin
his
forefinger
encounter
there
be
of
too
pale
a
colour
to
cover
that
small
debt
,
without
payment
of
which
the
stable
-
keeper
have
declare
he
would
never
do
any
more
business
with
Dunsey
Cass
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
,
accord
to
the
direction
in
which
the
run
have
bring
him
,
he
be
not
so
very
much
farther
from
home
than
he
be
from
Batherley
;
but
Dunsey
,
not
be
remarkable
for
clearness
of
head
,
be
only
lead
to
this
conclusion
by
the
gradual
perception
that
there
be
other
reason
for
choose
the
unprecedented
course
of
walk
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
nearly
four
o'clock
,
and
a
mist
be
gather
:
<EOS>
the
sooner
he
get
into
the
road
the
well
.
<EOS>
He
remember
have
cross
the
road
and
see
the
finger
-
post
only
a
little
while
before
Wildfire
break
down
;
so
,
button
his
coat
,
twist
the
lash
of
his
hunting
-
whip
compactly
round
the
handle
,
and
rap
the
top
of
his
boot
with
a
self
-
possess
air
,
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
he
be
not
at
all
take
by
surprise
,
he
set
off
with
the
sense
that
he
be
undertake
a
remarkable
feat
of
bodily
exertion
,
which
somehow
and
at
some
time
he
should
be
able
to
dress
up
and
magnify
to
the
admiration
of
a
select
circle
at
the
Rainbow
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
young
gentleman
like
Dunsey
be
reduce
to
so
exceptional
a
mode
of
locomotion
as
walk
,
a
whip
in
his
hand
be
a
desirable
corrective
to
a
too
bewilder
dreamy
sense
of
unwontedness
in
his
position
;
and
Dunstan
,
as
he
go
along
through
the
gathering
mist
,
be
always
rap
his
whip
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Godfrey
's
whip
,
which
he
have
choose
to
take
without
leave
because
it
have
a
gold
handle
;
of
course
no
one
could
see
,
when
Dunstan
hold
it
,
that
the
name
_
Godfrey
Cass
_
be
cut
in
deep
letter
on
that
gold
<EOS>
handle
 
<EOS>
they
could
only
see
that
it
be
a
very
handsome
whip
.
<EOS>
Dunsey
be
not
without
fear
that
he
may
meet
some
acquaintance
in
whose
eye
he
would
cut
a
pitiable
figure
,
for
mist
be
no
screen
when
people
get
close
to
each
other
;
but
when
he
at
last
find
himself
in
the
well
-
know
Raveloe
lane
without
have
meet
a
soul
,
he
silently
remark
that
that
be
part
of
his
usual
good
luck
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
mist
,
help
by
the
evening
darkness
,
be
more
of
a
screen
than
he
desire
,
for
it
hide
the
rut
into
which
his
foot
be
liable
to
slip
 
<EOS>
hide
everything
,
so
that
he
have
to
guide
his
step
by
drag
his
whip
along
the
low
bush
in
advance
of
the
hedgerow
.
<EOS>
He
must
soon
,
he
think
,
be
get
near
the
opening
at
the
Stone
-
pit
:
he
should
find
it
out
by
the
break
in
the
hedgerow
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
it
out
,
however
,
by
another
circumstance
which
he
have
not
expect
 
namely
,
by
certain
gleam
of
light
,
which
he
presently
guess
to
proceed
from
Silas
Marner
's
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
that
cottage
and
the
money
hide
within
it
have
be
in
his
mind
continually
during
his
walk
,
and
he
have
be
imagine
way
of
cajole
and
tempt
the
weaver
to
part
with
the
immediate
possession
of
his
money
for
the
sake
of
receive
interest
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
feel
as
if
there
must
be
a
little
frightening
add
to
the
cajolery
,
for
his
own
arithmetical
conviction
be
not
clear
enough
to
afford
him
any
forcible
demonstration
as
to
the
advantage
of
interest
;
and
as
for
security
,
he
regard
it
vaguely
as
a
means
of
cheat
a
man
by
make
him
believe
that
he
would
be
pay
.
 
<EOS>
altogether
,
the
operation
on
the
miser
's
mind
be
a
task
that
Godfrey
would
be
sure
to
hand
over
to
his
more
daring
and
cunning
brother
:
Dunstan
have
make
up
his
mind
to
that
;
and
by
the
time
he
see
the
light
gleam
through
the
chink
of
Marner
's
shutter
,
the
idea
of
a
dialogue
with
the
weaver
have
become
so
familiar
to
him
,
that
it
occur
to
him
as
quite
a
natural
thing
to
make
the
acquaintance
forthwith
.
 
<EOS>
there
may
be
several
convenience
attend
this
course
:
the
weaver
have
possibly
get
a
lantern
,
and
Dunstan
be
tired
of
feel
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
still
nearly
three
-
quarter
of
a
mile
from
home
,
and
the
lane
be
become
unpleasantly
slippery
,
for
the
mist
be
pass
into
rain
.
<EOS>
He
turn
up
the
bank
,
not
without
some
fear
lest
he
may
miss
the
right
way
,
since
he
be
not
certain
whether
the
light
be
in
front
or
on
the
side
of
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
feel
the
ground
before
him
cautiously
with
his
whip
-
handle
,
and
at
last
arrive
safely
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
knock
loudly
,
rather
enjoy
the
idea
that
the
old
fellow
would
be
frighten
at
the
sudden
noise
.
 
<EOS>
He
hear
no
movement
in
reply
:
all
be
silence
in
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
be
the
weaver
go
to
bed
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
if
so
,
why
have
he
leave
a
light
?
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
strange
forgetfulness
in
a
miser
.
<EOS>
Dunstan
knock
still
more
loudly
,
and
,
without
pause
for
a
reply
,
push
his
finger
through
the
latch
-
hole
,
intend
to
shake
the
door
and
pull
the
latch
-
string
up
and
down
,
not
doubt
that
the
door
be
fasten
.
<EOS>
but
,
to
his
surprise
,
at
this
double
motion
the
door
open
,
and
he
find
himself
in
front
of
a
bright
fire
which
light
up
every
corner
of
the
cottage
 
the
bed
,
the
loom
,
the
three
chair
,
and
the
table
 
and
show
him
that
Marner
be
not
there
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
at
that
moment
could
be
much
more
inviting
to
Dunsey
than
the
bright
fire
on
the
brick
hearth
:
he
walk
in
and
seat
himself
by
it
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
front
of
the
fire
,
too
,
that
would
have
be
invite
to
a
hungry
man
,
if
it
have
be
in
a
different
stage
of
cooking
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
small
bit
of
pork
suspend
from
the
kettle
-
hanger
by
a
string
pass
through
a
large
door
-
key
,
in
a
way
know
to
primitive
housekeeper
unpossesse
of
jack
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
pork
have
be
hang
at
the
farth
extremity
of
the
hanger
,
apparently
to
prevent
the
roasting
from
proceed
too
rapidly
during
the
owner
's
absence
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
stare
simpleton
have
hot
meat
for
his
supper
,
then
?
<EOS>
think
Dunstan
.
 
<EOS>
People
have
always
say
he
live
on
mouldy
bread
,
on
purpose
to
check
his
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
but
where
could
he
be
at
this
time
,
and
on
such
an
evening
,
leave
his
supper
in
this
stage
of
preparation
,
and
his
door
unfastened
?
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
's
own
recent
difficulty
in
make
his
way
suggest
to
him
that
the
weaver
have
perhaps
go
outside
his
cottage
to
fetch
in
fuel
,
or
for
some
such
brief
purpose
,
and
have
slip
into
the
Stone
-
pit
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
an
interesting
idea
to
Dunstan
,
carry
consequence
of
entire
novelty
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
weaver
be
dead
,
who
have
a
right
to
his
money
?
 
<EOS>
who
would
know
where
his
money
be
hide
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
who
would
know
that
anybody
have
come
to
take
it
away
?
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
He
go
no
farther
into
the
subtlety
of
evidence
:
<EOS>
the
press
question
,
"
where
_
be
_
the
money
?
"
 
now
take
such
entire
possession
of
him
as
to
make
him
quite
forget
that
the
weaver
's
death
be
not
a
certainty
.
 
<EOS>
a
dull
mind
,
once
arrive
at
an
inference
that
flatter
a
desire
,
be
rarely
able
to
retain
the
impression
that
the
notion
from
which
the
inference
start
be
purely
problematic
.
 
<EOS>
and
Dunstan
's
mind
be
as
dull
as
the
mind
of
a
possible
felon
usually
be
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
only
three
hiding
-
place
where
he
have
ever
hear
of
cottager
'
hoard
be
find
:
the
thatch
,
the
bed
,
and
a
hole
in
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
Marner
's
cottage
have
no
thatch
;
and
Dunstan
's
first
act
,
after
a
train
of
thought
make
rapid
by
the
stimulus
of
cupidity
,
be
to
go
up
to
the
bed
;
but
while
he
do
so
,
his
eye
travel
eagerly
over
the
floor
,
where
the
brick
,
distinct
in
the
fire
-
light
,
be
discernible
under
the
sprinkling
of
sand
.
 
<EOS>
but
not
everywhere
;
for
there
be
one
spot
,
and
one
only
,
which
be
quite
cover
with
sand
,
and
sand
show
the
mark
of
finger
,
which
have
apparently
be
careful
to
spread
it
over
a
give
space
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
near
the
treddle
of
the
loom
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
Dunstan
dart
to
that
spot
,
sweep
away
the
sand
with
his
whip
,
and
,
insert
the
thin
end
of
the
hook
between
the
brick
,
find
that
they
be
loose
.
 
<EOS>
in
haste
he
lift
up
two
brick
,
and
see
what
he
have
no
doubt
be
the
object
of
his
search
;
for
what
could
there
be
but
money
in
those
two
leathern
bag
?
 
<EOS>
and
,
from
their
weight
,
they
must
be
fill
with
guinea
.
<EOS>
Dunstan
feel
round
the
hole
,
to
be
certain
that
it
hold
no
more
;
then
hastily
replace
the
brick
,
and
spread
the
sand
over
them
.
 
<EOS>
hardly
more
than
five
minute
have
pass
since
he
enter
the
cottage
,
but
it
seem
to
Dunstan
like
a
long
while
;
and
though
he
be
without
any
distinct
recognition
of
the
possibility
that
Marner
may
be
alive
,
and
may
re
-
enter
the
cottage
at
any
moment
,
he
feel
an
undefinable
dread
lay
hold
on
him
,
as
he
rise
to
his
foot
with
the
bag
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
would
hasten
out
into
the
darkness
,
and
then
consider
what
he
should
do
with
the
bag
.
 
<EOS>
He
close
the
door
behind
him
immediately
,
that
he
may
shut
in
the
stream
of
light
:
a
few
step
would
be
enough
to
carry
him
beyond
betrayal
by
the
gleam
from
the
shutter
-
chink
and
the
latch
-
hole
.
 
<EOS>
the
rain
and
darkness
have
get
thick
,
and
he
be
glad
of
it
;
though
it
be
awkward
walk
with
both
hand
fill
,
so
that
it
be
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
grasp
his
whip
along
with
one
of
the
bag
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
go
a
yard
or
two
,
he
may
take
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
step
forward
into
the
darkness
.
    
<EOS>
when
Dunstan
Cass
turn
his
back
on
the
cottage
,
Silas
Marner
be
not
more
than
a
hundred
yard
away
from
it
,
plod
along
from
the
village
with
a
sack
throw
round
his
shoulder
as
an
overcoat
,
and
with
a
horn
lantern
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
His
leg
be
weary
,
but
his
mind
be
at
ease
,
free
from
the
presentiment
of
change
.
 
<EOS>
the
sense
of
security
more
frequently
spring
from
habit
than
from
conviction
,
and
for
this
reason
it
often
subsist
after
such
a
change
in
the
condition
as
may
have
be
expect
to
suggest
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
the
lapse
of
time
during
which
a
give
event
have
not
happen
,
be
,
in
this
logic
of
habit
,
constantly
allege
as
a
reason
why
the
event
should
never
happen
,
even
when
the
lapse
of
time
be
precisely
the
add
condition
which
make
the
event
imminent
.
<EOS>
a
man
will
tell
you
that
he
have
work
in
a
mine
for
forty
year
unhurt
by
an
accident
as
a
reason
why
he
should
apprehend
no
danger
,
though
the
roof
be
begin
to
sink
;
and
it
be
often
observable
,
that
the
old
a
man
get
,
the
more
difficult
it
be
to
him
to
retain
a
believe
conception
of
his
own
death
.
 
<EOS>
this
influence
of
habit
be
necessarily
strong
in
a
man
whose
life
be
so
monotonous
as
Marner
's
 
who
see
no
new
people
and
hear
of
no
new
event
to
keep
alive
in
him
the
idea
of
the
unexpected
and
the
changeful
;
and
it
explain
simply
enough
,
why
his
mind
could
be
at
ease
,
though
he
have
leave
his
house
and
his
treasure
more
defenceless
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
be
think
with
double
complacency
of
his
supper
:
first
,
because
it
would
be
hot
and
savoury
;
and
secondly
,
because
it
would
cost
him
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
little
bit
of
pork
be
a
present
from
that
excellent
housewife
,
Miss
Priscilla
Lammeter
,
to
whom
he
have
this
day
carry
home
a
handsome
piece
of
linen
;
and
it
be
only
on
occasion
of
a
present
like
this
,
that
Silas
indulge
himself
with
roast
-
meat
.
 
<EOS>
Supper
be
his
favourite
meal
,
because
it
come
at
his
time
of
revelry
,
when
his
heart
warm
over
his
gold
;
whenever
he
have
roast
-
meat
,
he
always
choose
to
have
it
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
evening
,
he
have
no
sooner
ingeniously
knot
his
string
fast
round
his
bit
of
pork
,
twist
the
string
accord
to
rule
over
his
door
-
key
,
pass
it
through
the
handle
,
and
make
it
fast
on
the
hanger
,
than
he
remember
that
a
piece
of
very
fine
twine
be
indispensable
to
his
"
set
up
"
a
new
piece
of
work
in
his
loom
early
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
slip
his
memory
,
because
,
in
come
from
Mr.
Lammeter
's
,
he
have
not
have
to
pass
through
the
village
;
but
to
lose
time
by
go
on
errand
in
the
morning
<EOS>
be
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
nasty
fog
to
turn
out
into
,
but
there
be
thing
Silas
love
better
than
his
own
comfort
;
so
,
draw
his
pork
to
the
extremity
of
the
hanger
,
and
arm
himself
with
his
lantern
and
his
old
sack
,
he
set
out
on
what
,
in
ordinary
weather
,
would
have
be
a
twenty
minute
'
errand
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
lock
his
door
without
undo
his
well
-
knot
string
and
retard
his
supper
;
it
be
not
worth
his
while
to
make
that
sacrifice
.
 
<EOS>
what
thief
would
find
his
way
to
the
Stone
-
pit
on
such
a
night
as
this
?
<EOS>
and
why
should
he
come
on
this
particular
night
,
when
he
have
never
come
through
all
the
fifteen
year
before
?
 
<EOS>
these
question
be
not
distinctly
present
in
Silas
's
mind
;
they
merely
serve
to
represent
the
vaguely
-
feel
foundation
of
his
freedom
from
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
He
reach
his
door
in
much
satisfaction
that
his
errand
be
do
:
he
open
it
,
and
to
his
short
-
sight
eye
everything
remain
as
he
have
leave
it
,
except
that
the
fire
send
out
a
welcome
increase
of
heat
.
 
<EOS>
He
tread
about
the
floor
while
put
by
his
lantern
and
throw
aside
his
hat
and
sack
,
so
as
to
merge
the
mark
of
Dunstan
's
foot
on
the
sand
in
the
mark
of
his
own
nail
boot
.
<EOS>
then
he
move
his
pork
nearer
to
the
fire
,
and
sit
down
to
the
agreeable
business
of
tend
the
meat
and
warm
himself
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
any
one
who
have
look
at
him
as
the
red
light
shine
upon
his
pale
face
,
strange
straining
eye
,
and
meagre
form
,
would
perhaps
have
understand
the
mixture
of
contemptuous
pity
,
dread
,
and
suspicion
with
which
he
be
regard
by
his
neighbour
in
Raveloe
.
 
<EOS>
yet
few
man
could
be
more
harmless
than
poor
Marner
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
truthful
simple
soul
,
not
even
the
grow
greed
and
worship
of
gold
could
beget
any
vice
directly
injurious
to
other
.
 
<EOS>
the
light
of
his
faith
quite
put
out
,
and
his
affection
make
desolate
,
he
have
cling
with
all
the
force
of
his
nature
to
his
work
and
his
money
;
and
like
all
object
to
which
a
man
devote
himself
,
they
have
fashion
him
into
correspondence
with
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
His
loom
,
as
he
work
in
it
without
cease
,
have
in
its
turn
work
on
him
,
and
confirm
more
and
more
the
monotonous
craving
for
its
monotonous
response
.
 
<EOS>
His
gold
,
as
he
hang
over
it
and
see
it
grow
,
gather
his
power
of
love
together
into
a
hard
isolation
like
its
own
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
be
warm
he
begin
to
think
it
would
be
a
long
while
to
wait
till
after
supper
before
he
draw
out
his
guinea
,
and
it
would
be
pleasant
to
see
them
on
the
table
before
him
as
he
eat
his
unwonted
feast
.
 
<EOS>
for
joy
be
the
good
of
wine
,
and
Silas
's
guinea
be
a
golden
wine
of
that
sort
.
  
<EOS>
He
rise
and
place
his
candle
unsuspectingly
on
the
floor
near
his
loom
,
sweep
away
the
sand
without
notice
any
change
,
and
remove
the
brick
.
 
<EOS>
the
sight
of
the
empty
hole
make
his
heart
leap
violently
,
but
the
belief
that
his
gold
be
go
could
not
come
at
once
 
only
terror
,
and
the
eager
effort
to
put
an
end
to
the
terror
.
 
<EOS>
He
pass
his
tremble
hand
all
about
the
hole
,
try
to
think
it
possible
that
his
eye
have
deceive
him
;
then
he
hold
the
candle
in
the
hole
and
examine
it
curiously
,
tremble
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
shake
so
violently
that
he
let
fall
the
candle
,
and
lift
his
hand
to
his
head
,
try
to
steady
himself
,
that
he
may
think
.
 
<EOS>
have
he
put
his
gold
somewhere
else
,
by
a
sudden
resolution
last
night
,
and
then
forget
it
?
 
<EOS>
a
man
fall
into
dark
water
seek
a
momentary
footing
even
on
slide
stone
;
and
Silas
,
by
act
as
if
he
believe
in
false
hope
,
ward
off
the
moment
of
despair
.
 
<EOS>
He
search
in
every
corner
,
he
turn
his
bed
over
,
and
shake
it
,
and
knead
it
;
he
look
in
his
brick
oven
where
he
lay
his
stick
.
 
<EOS>
when
there
be
no
other
place
to
be
search
,
he
kneel
down
again
and
feel
once
more
all
round
the
hole
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
untried
refuge
leave
for
a
moment
's
shelter
from
the
terrible
truth
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
there
be
a
sort
of
refuge
which
always
come
with
the
prostration
of
thought
under
an
overpower
passion
:
it
be
that
expectation
of
impossibility
,
that
belief
in
contradictory
image
,
which
be
still
distinct
from
madness
,
because
it
be
capable
of
be
dissipate
by
the
external
fact
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
get
up
from
his
knee
tremble
,
and
look
round
at
the
table
:
do
not
the
gold
lie
there
after
all
?
 
<EOS>
the
table
be
bare
.
<EOS>
then
he
turn
and
look
behind
him
 
look
all
round
his
dwelling
,
seem
to
strain
his
brown
eye
after
some
possible
appearance
of
the
bag
where
he
have
already
seek
them
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
see
every
object
in
his
cottage
 
and
his
gold
be
not
there
.
  
<EOS>
again
he
put
his
tremble
hand
to
his
head
,
and
give
a
wild
ringing
scream
,
the
cry
of
desolation
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
after
,
he
stand
motionless
;
but
the
cry
have
relieve
him
from
the
first
maddening
pressure
of
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
,
and
totter
towards
his
loom
,
and
get
into
the
seat
where
he
work
,
instinctively
seek
this
as
the
strong
assurance
of
reality
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
that
all
the
false
hope
have
vanish
,
and
the
first
shock
of
certainty
be
past
,
the
idea
of
a
thief
begin
to
present
itself
,
and
he
entertain
it
eagerly
,
because
a
thief
may
be
catch
and
make
to
restore
the
gold
.
 
<EOS>
the
thought
bring
some
new
strength
with
it
,
and
he
start
from
his
loom
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
open
it
the
rain
beat
in
upon
him
,
for
it
be
fall
more
and
more
heavily
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
footstep
to
be
track
on
such
a
night
 
footstep
?
<EOS>
when
have
the
thief
come
?
 
<EOS>
during
Silas
's
absence
in
the
daytime
the
door
have
be
lock
,
and
there
have
be
no
mark
of
any
inroad
on
his
return
by
daylight
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
evening
,
too
,
he
say
to
himself
,
everything
be
the
same
as
when
he
have
leave
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
sand
and
brick
look
as
if
they
have
not
be
move
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
be
_
it
a
thief
who
have
take
the
bag
?
 
<EOS>
or
be
it
a
cruel
power
that
no
hand
could
reach
,
which
have
delight
in
make
him
a
second
time
desolate
?
 
<EOS>
He
shrink
from
this
vaguer
dread
,
and
fix
his
mind
with
struggle
effort
on
the
robber
with
hand
,
who
could
be
reach
by
hand
.
 
<EOS>
His
thought
glance
at
all
the
neighbour
who
have
make
any
remark
,
or
ask
any
question
which
he
may
now
regard
as
a
ground
of
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
Jem
Rodney
,
a
know
poacher
,
and
otherwise
disreputable
:
he
have
often
meet
Marner
in
his
journey
across
the
field
,
and
have
say
something
jestingly
about
the
weaver
's
money
;
nay
,
he
have
once
irritate
Marner
,
by
linger
at
the
fire
when
he
call
to
light
his
pipe
,
instead
of
go
about
his
business
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
Rodney
be
the
man
 
<EOS>
there
be
ease
in
the
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
could
be
find
and
make
to
restore
the
money
:
Marner
do
not
want
to
punish
him
,
but
only
to
get
back
his
gold
which
have
go
from
him
,
and
leave
his
soul
like
a
forlorn
traveller
on
an
unknown
desert
.
 
<EOS>
the
robber
must
be
lay
hold
of
.
 
<EOS>
Marner
's
idea
of
legal
authority
be
confuse
,
but
he
feel
that
he
must
go
and
proclaim
his
loss
;
and
the
great
people
in
the
village
 
<EOS>
the
clergyman
,
the
constable
,
and
<EOS>
Squire
Cass
 
would
make
Jem
Rodney
,
or
somebody
else
,
deliver
up
the
steal
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
rush
out
in
the
rain
,
under
the
stimulus
of
this
hope
,
forget
to
cover
his
head
,
not
care
to
fasten
his
door
;
for
he
feel
as
if
he
have
nothing
leave
to
lose
.
 
<EOS>
He
run
swiftly
,
till
want
of
breath
compel
him
to
slacken
his
pace
as
he
be
enter
the
village
at
the
turning
close
to
the
Rainbow
.
  
<EOS>
the
Rainbow
,
in
Marner
's
view
,
be
a
place
of
luxurious
resort
for
rich
and
stout
husband
,
whose
wife
have
superfluous
store
of
linen
;
it
be
the
place
where
he
be
likely
to
find
the
power
and
dignity
of
Raveloe
,
and
where
he
could
most
speedily
make
his
loss
public
.
 
<EOS>
He
lift
the
latch
,
and
turn
into
the
bright
bar
or
kitchen
on
the
right
hand
,
where
the
less
lofty
customer
of
the
house
be
in
the
habit
of
assemble
,
the
parlour
on
the
left
be
reserve
for
the
more
select
society
in
which
Squire
Cass
frequently
enjoy
the
double
pleasure
of
conviviality
and
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
parlour
be
dark
to
-
night
,
the
chief
personage
who
ornament
its
circle
be
all
at
Mrs.
Osgood
's
birthday
dance
,
as
Godfrey
Cass
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
consequence
of
this
,
the
party
on
the
high
-
screened
seat
in
the
kitchen
be
more
numerous
than
usual
;
several
personage
,
who
would
otherwise
have
be
admit
into
the
parlour
and
enlarge
the
opportunity
of
hectoring
and
condescension
for
their
better
,
be
content
this
evening
to
vary
their
enjoyment
by
take
their
spirit
-
and
-
water
where
they
could
themselves
hector
and
condescend
in
company
that
call
for
beer
.
    
<EOS>
the
conversation
,
which
be
at
a
high
pitch
of
animation
when
Silas
approach
the
door
of
the
Rainbow
,
have
,
as
usual
,
be
slow
and
intermittent
when
the
company
first
assemble
.
 
<EOS>
the
pipe
begin
to
be
puff
in
a
silence
which
have
an
air
of
severity
;
the
more
important
customer
,
who
drink
spirit
and
sit
near
the
fire
,
stare
at
each
other
as
if
a
bet
be
depend
on
the
first
man
who
wink
;
while
the
beer
-
drinker
,
chiefly
man
in
fustian
jacket
and
smock
-
frock
,
keep
their
eyelid
down
and
rub
their
hand
across
their
mouth
,
as
if
their
draught
of
beer
be
a
funereal
duty
attend
with
embarrassing
sadness
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
Mr.
Snell
,
the
landlord
,
a
man
of
a
neutral
disposition
,
accustom
to
stand
aloof
from
human
difference
as
those
of
being
who
be
all
alike
in
need
of
liquor
,
break
silence
,
by

in
a
doubtful
tone
to
his
cousin

after

"
be

"
 
<EOS>
say
the
farrier
,
take
up
the
thread

after
the
lapse

minute

the

look
at
the

and
the
landlord
look
at
the
butcher

as
the
person
who
must
take
the
responsibility
of

"
Red

there
be
<EOS>
nobody

know
about
those

only
it
could
not
be
far
north'ard

nor
much
different
from
this
country

for
he
bring
a
fine
breed
o

sheep

him

so
there
must
be
pasture
there
,
and
<EOS>
everything
reasonable

<EOS>
We
hear
tell
as
he
would
sell
his
own

come

take

that
seem
odd
for
a

have
land
of
his
own

to
come

rent
a
farm
in
a
strange
place

they
say
it
be
along

dying

though
there
be
reason
in
thing
as
nobody
know
on

be
pretty
much
what
I
have
make
out

some
folk
be

find
you
fifty

all

help
;
and
so
Mr.
Drumlow
 
poor
old
gentleman
<EOS>
,
I
be
fond
on
him
 
<EOS>
but
when
he
come
to
put
the
question
,
he
put
'em
by
the
rule
o
'
contrairy
,
like
,
and
he
say
,
"
Wilt
thou
have
this
man
to
thy
wed
wife
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
and
then
he
say
,
"
Wilt
thou
have
this
woman
to
thy
wedded
husband
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
but
the
partic'larest
thing
of
all
be
,
as
nobody
take
any
notice
on
it
<EOS>
but
me
,
and
<EOS>
they
answer
straight
off
"
yes
"
,
like
as
if
it
have
be
me
say
<EOS>
"
amen
"
i
'
the
right
place
,
without
listen
to
what
go
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
_
you
_
know
what
be
go
on
well
enough
,
do
not
you
,
Mr.
Macey
?
<EOS>
You
be
live
enough
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
the
butcher
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lor
bless
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
say
Mr.
Macey
,
pause
,
and
smile
in
pity
at
the
impotence
of
his
hearer
's
imagination
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
be
all
of
a
tremble
:
it
be
as
if
I
would
be
a
coat
pull
by
the
two
tail
,
like
;
for
I
could
not
stop
the
parson
,
I
could
not
take
upon
me
to
do
that
;
and
yet
I
say
to
myself
,
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
suppose
they
should
not
be
fast
married
,
because
the
word
be
contrairy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
my
head
go
work
like
a
mill
,
<EOS>
for
I
be
allays
uncommon
for
turn
thing
over
and
see
all
round
'em
;
and
I
say
to
myself
,
"
is't
<EOS>
the
meanin
'
or
the
word
as
make
folk
fast
<EOS>
i
'
wedlock
?
"
 
<EOS>
for
the
parson
mean
right
,
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
mean
right
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
when
I
come
to
think
on
it
,
meanin
'
go
but
<EOS>
a
little
way
<EOS>
i
'
most
thing
,
for
you
may
mean
to
stick
thing
together
and
your
glue
may
be
bad
,
and
then
where
be
you
?
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
say
to
mysen
,
"
It
be
not
the
meanin
'
,
it
be
the
glue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
worrete
as
if
I
would
get
three
bell
to
pull
at
once
,
when
we
go
into
the
vestry
,
and
they
begin
to
sign
their
name
.
 
<EOS>
but
where
be
the
use
<EOS>
o
'
talking
?
 
<EOS>
you
can
not
think
what
go
on
in
a
'
cute
man
be
inside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
hold
in
for
all
that
,
do
not
you
,
Mr.
Macey
?
"
 
say
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
I
hold
in
tight
till
I
be
by
mysen
<EOS>
wi
'
Mr.
Drumlow
,
and
then
I
out
wi
'
everything
,
but
respectful
,
as
I
allays
do
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
make
light
on
it
,
and
he
say
,
"
pooh
,
pooh
,
Macey
,
make
yourself
easy
,
"
he
say
;
"
it
be
neither
the
meaning
nor
the
word
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
re_ges_ter
<EOS>
do
it
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
glue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
you
see
he
settle
it
easy
;
for
parson
and
doctor
know
everything
by
heart
,
like
,
so
as
they
be
not
worrete
wi
'
think
what
be
the
right
and
wrong
<EOS>
o
'
thing
,
as
I'n
be
many
and
many
be
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
sure
enough
the
wedding
turn
out
all
right
,
on'y
<EOS>
poor
Mrs.
Lammeter
 
<EOS>
that
be
Miss
Osgood
as
be
 
<EOS>
die
<EOS>
afore
the
lass
be
grow
up
;
but
for
prosperity
and
everything
respectable
,
there
be
no
family
more
look
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
every
one
of
Mr.
Macey
's
audience
have
hear
this
story
many
time
,
but
it
be
listen
to
as
if
it
have
be
a
favourite
tune
,
and
at
certain
point
the
puffing
of
the
pipe
be
momentarily
suspend
,
that
the
listener
may
give
their
whole
mind
to
the
expect
word
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
more
to
come
;
and
Mr.
Snell
,
the
landlord
,
duly
put
the
leading
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
old
Mr.
Lammeter
have
a
pretty
fortin
,
do
not
they
say
,
when
he
come
into
these
part
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
yes
,
"
say
Mr.
Macey
;
"
but
I
daresay
it
be
as
much
as
this
Mr.
Lammeter
be
do
to
keep
it
whole
.
 
<EOS>
for
there
be
allay
a
talk
as
nobody
could
get
rich
on
the
Warrens
:
though
he
hold
it
cheap
,
for
it
be
what
they
call
Charity
Land
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
and
there
be
few
folk
know
so
well
as
you
how
it
come
to
be
Charity
Land
,
eh
,
Mr.
Macey
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
the
butcher
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
should
they
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
the
old
clerk
,
with
some
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
grandfather
make
the
groom
'
livery
for
that
Mr.
Cliff
as
come
and
build
the
big
stable
at
the
Warrens
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
they
be
stable
four
time
as
big
as
Squire
Cass
's
,
for
he
think
o
'
<EOS>
nothing
but
hosse
and
hunting
,
Cliff
<EOS>
do
not
 
a
Lunnon
tailor
,
some
folk
say
,
as
have
go
mad
wi
'
cheating
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
could
not
ride
;
lor
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
they
say
he
would
get
no
more
grip
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
hoss
than
if
his
leg
have
be
cross
-
stick
<EOS>
:
my
grandfather
hear
<EOS>
old
Squire
Cass
say
so
many
and
many
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
ride
he
would
,
as
if
Old
Harry
have
be
a
-
drive
him
;
and
he
would
a
son
,
a
lad
o
'
sixteen
;
and
nothing
would
his
father
have
him
do
,
but
he
must
ride
and
ride
 
though
the
lad
be
fright
,
they
say
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
a
common
saying
as
the
father
want
to
ride
the
tailor
out
o
'
the
lad
,
and
make
a
gentleman
on
him
 
not
<EOS>
but
what
I
be
a
tailor
myself
,
but
in
respect
as
God
make
me
such
,
I
be
proud
on
it
,
for

Macey
,
tailor

,
be
be
write
up
over
our
door
since
afore
<EOS>
the
Queen
's
head
go
out
on
the
shilling

<EOS>
but
Cliff
,
he
be
ashamed
o
'
be
call
a
tailor
,
and
he
be
sore
vexed
as
his
riding
be
laugh
at
,
and
nobody
o
'
<EOS>
the
gentlefolk
hereabout
could
abide
him
.
 
<EOS>
Howsomever
,
the
poor
lad
get
sickly
and
die
,
and
the
father
do
not
live
long
after
him
,
for
he
get
queerer
nor
ever
,
and
they
say
he
use
to
go
out
<EOS>
i
'
the
dead
o
'
<EOS>
the
night
,
wi
'
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
to
the
stable
,
and
set
a
lot
o
'
light
burn
,
for
he
get
as
he
could
not
sleep
;
and
there
he
would
stand
,
crack
his
whip
and
look
at
his
hosse
;
and
they
say
it
be
a
mercy
as
the
stable
do
not
get
burn
down
wi
'
the
poor
dumb
creatur
in
'em
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
last
he
die
rave
,
and
they
find
as
he
would
leave
all
his
property
,
warren
and
all
,
to
a
Lunnon
Charity
,
and
that
be
how
the
warren
come
to
be
Charity
Land
<EOS>
;
though
,
as
for

Mr.

never

down

refreshed

say
Mr.
Macey
,
in
deep
disgust
at
the
farri
's
crass
incompetence
to
apprehend
the
condition
of
ghostly
phenomenon
.
    
<EOS>
yet
the
next
moment
there
seem
to
be
some
evidence
that
ghost
have
a
more
condescending
disposition
than
Mr.
Macey
attribute
to
them
;
for
the
pale
thin
figure
of
Silas
Marner
be
suddenly
see
stand
in
the
warm
light
,
utter
no
word
,
but
look
round
at
the
company
with
his
strange
unearthly
eye
.
 
<EOS>
the
long
pipe
give
a
simultaneous
movement
,
like
the
antennae
of
startled
insect
,
and
every
man
present
,
not
except
even
the
sceptical
farrier
,
have
an
impression
that
he
see
,
not
Silas
Marner
in
the
flesh
,
but
an
apparition
;
for
the
door
by
which
Silas
have
enter
be
hide
by
the
high
-
screened
seat
,
and
no
one
have
notice
his
approach
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Macey
,
sit
a
long
way
off
the
ghost
,
may
be
suppose
to
have
feel
an
argumentative
triumph
,
which
would
tend
to
neutralize
his
share
of
the
general
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
have
he
not
always
say
that
when
Silas
Marner
be
in
that
strange
trance
of
his
,
his
soul
go
loose
from
his
body
?
 
<EOS>
here
be
the
demonstration
:
nevertheless
,
on
the
whole
,
he
would
have
be
as
well
contented
without
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
there
be
a
dead
silence
,
Marner
's
want
of
breath
and
agitation
not
allow
him
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlord
,
under
the
habitual
sense
that
he
be
bind
to
keep
his
house
open
to
all
company
,
and
confident
in
the
protection
of
his
unbroken
neutrality

at
last
take
on
himself
the
task

adjure
the
ghost

the

force
Marner
to
take
off

then
to
sit
down
on

chair
aloof

<EOS>
"
now
then
,
Master
Marner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
now
tell
his
story
,
under
frequent
questioning
as
the
mysterious
character
of
the
robbery
become
evident
.
  
<EOS>
this
strangely
novel
situation
of
open
his
trouble
to
his
Raveloe
neighbour
,
of
sit
in
the
warmth
of
a
hearth
not
his
own
,
and
feel
the
presence
of
face
and
voice
which
be
his
near
promise
of
help
,
have
doubtless
its
influence
on
Marner
,
in
spite
of
his
passionate
preoccupation
with
his
loss
.
 
<EOS>
Our
consciousness
rarely
register
the
beginning
of
a
growth
within
us
any
more
than
without
us
:
there
have
be
many
circulation
of
the
sap
before
we
detect
the
small
sign
of
the
bud
.
  
<EOS>
the
slight
suspicion
with
which
his
hearer
at
first
listen
to
him
,
gradually
melt
away
before
the
convincing
simplicity
of
his
distress
:
it
be
impossible
for
the
neighbour
to
doubt
that
Marner
be
tell
the
truth
,
not
because
they
be
capable
of
argue
at
once
from
the
nature
of
his
statement
to
the
absence
of
any
motive
for
make
them
falsely
,
but
because
,
as
Mr.
Macey
observe
,
"
folk
as
have
the
devil
to
back
<EOS>
'em
be
not
likely
to
be
so
mush
"
as
poor
Silas
be
.
 
<EOS>
rather
,
from
the
strange
fact
that
the
robber
have
leave
no
trace
,
and
have
happen
to
know
the
nick
of
time
,
utterly
incalculable
by
mortal
agent
,
when
Silas
would
go
away
from
home
without
lock
his
door
,
the
more
probable
conclusion
seem
to
be
,
that
his
disreputable
intimacy
in
that
quarter
,
if
it
ever
exist
,
have
be
break
up
,
and
that
,
in
consequence
,
this
ill
turn
have
be
do
to
Marner
by
somebody
it
be
quite
in
vain
to
set
the
constable
after
.
 
<EOS>
why
this
preternatural
felon
should
be
oblige
to
wait
till
the
door
be
leave
unlocked
,
be
a
question
which
do
not
present
itself

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
Jem

do
this
work

"
You
must

there
may

from

I
will
go
back

your

if
anybody

get
any
fault

stand
up

upon
this
,
the
farri
being
of
course
indispose
to
renounce
the
quality
of
doctor
,
but
contend
that
a
doctor
could
be
a
constable
if
he
like
 
the
law
mean
,
he
nee
not
be
one
if
he
do
not
like
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Macey
think
this
be
nonsense
,
since
the
law
be
not
likely
to
be
fonder
of
doctor
than
of
other
folk
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
if
it
be
in
the
nature
of
doctor
more
than
of
other
man
not
to
like
be
constable
,
how
come
Mr.
Dowlas
to
be
so
eager
to
act
in
that
capacity
?
  
<EOS>
"
_
I

do
not

to
act
the
constable

"
say
the
farri

drive
into
a
corner
by
this
merciless
reasoning
;
"
and
there
be
no
man
<EOS>
can
say
it
of
me
,
if
he
would
tell
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
there
be
to
be
any
jealousy
and
en_vy_e
about
go
to
Kench
's
in
the
rain
,
let
them
go
as
like
it
 
<EOS>
you
will
not
get
me
to
go
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
by
the
landlord
's
intervention
,
however
,
the
dispute
be
accommodate
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dowlas
consent
to
go
as
a
second
person
disincline
to
act
officially
;
and
so
poor
Silas
,
furnish
with
some
old
covering
,
turn
out
with
his
two
companion
into
the
rain
again
,
think
of
the
long
night
-
hour
before
him
,
not
as
those
do
who
long
to
rest
,
but
as
those
who
expect
to
"
watch
for
the
morning
"
.
    
<EOS>
when
Godfrey
Cass
return
from
Mrs.
Osgood
's
party
at
midnight
,
he
be
not
much
surprised
to
learn
that
Dunsey
have
not
come
home
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
not
sell
Wildfire
,
and
be
wait
for
another
chance
 
perhaps
,
on
that
foggy
afternoon
,
he
have
prefer
housing
himself
at
the
Red
Lion
at
Batherley
for
the
night
,
if
the
run
have
keep
him
in
that
neighbourhood
;
for
he
be
not
likely
to
feel
much
concern
about
leave
his
brother
in
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
's
mind
be
too
full
of
Nancy
Lammeter
's
look
and
behaviour
,
too
full
of
the
exasperation
against
himself
and
his
lot
,
which
the
sight
of
her
always
produce
in
him
,
for
him
to
give
much
thought
to
Wildfire
,
or
to
the
probability
of
Dunstan
's
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
the
whole
village
be
excite
by
the
story
of
the
robbery
,
and
Godfrey
,
like
every
one
else
,
be
occupy
in
gathering
and
discuss
news
about
it
,
and
in
visit
the
Stone
-
pit
.
 
<EOS>
the
rain
have
wash
away
all
possibility
of
distinguish
foot
-
mark
,
but
a
close
investigation
of
the
spot
have
disclose
,
in
the
direction
opposite
to
the
village
,
a
tinder
-
box
,
with
a
flint
and
steel
,
half
sink
in
the
mud
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
Silas
's
tinder
-
box
,
for
the
only
one
he
have
ever
have
be
still
stand
on
his
shelf
;
and
the
inference
generally
accept
be
,
that
the
tinder
-
box
in
the
ditch
be
somehow
connect
with
the
robbery
.
 
<EOS>
a
small
minority
shake
their
head
,
and
intimate
their
opinion
that
it
be
not
a
robbery
to
have
much
light
throw
on
it
by
tinder
-
box
,
that
Master
Marner
's
tale
have
a
queer
look
with
it
,
and
that
such
thing
have
be
know
as
a
man
's
do
himself
a
mischief
,
and
then
set
the
justice
to
look
for
the
doer
.
<EOS>
but
when
question
closely
as
to
their
ground
for
this
opinion
,
and
what
Master
Marner
have
to
gain
by
such
false
pretence
,
they
only
shake
their
head
as
before
,
and
observe
that
there
be
no
know
what
some
folk
count
gain
;
moreover
,
that
everybody
have
a
right
to
their
own
opinion
,
ground
or
no
ground
,
and
that
the
weaver
,
as
everybody
know
,
be
partly
crazy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Macey
,
though
he
join
in
the
defence
of
Marner
against
all
suspicion
of
deceit
,
also
pooh
-
poohe
the
tinder
-
box
;
indeed
,
repudiate
it
as
a
rather
impious
suggestion
,
tend
to
imply
that
everything
must
be
do
by
human
hand
,
and
that
there
be
no
power
which
could
make
away
with
the
guinea
without
move
the
brick
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
turn
round
rather
sharply
on
Mr.
Tookey
,
when
the
zealous
deputy
,
feel
that
this
be
a
view
of
the
case
peculiarly
suit
to
a
parish
-
clerk
,
carry
it
still
farther
,
and
doubt
whether
it
be
right
to
inquire
into
a
robbery
at
all
when
the
circumstance
be
so
mysterious
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
if
,
"
conclude
Mr.
Tookey
 
"
as
if
there
be
nothing
but
what
could
be
make
out
by
justice
and
constable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
do
not
you
be
for
overshoot
the
mark
,
Tookey
,
"
say
Mr.
Macey
,
nod
his
head
aside
admonishingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
you
be
allay
at
;
if
I
throw
a
stone
and
hit
,
you
think
there
be
summat
better
than
hit
,
and
you
try
to
throw
a
stone
beyond
.
<EOS>
what
I
say
be
against
the
tinder
-
box
:
I
say
nothing
against
justice
and
constable
,
for
they
be
o
'
King
George
's
making
,
and
it
'
ud
be
ill
-
become
a
man
in
a
parish
office
to
fly
out
again
'
King
George
.
"
  
<EOS>
while
these
discussion
be
go
on
amongst
the
group
outside
the
Rainbow
,
a
high
consultation
be
be
carry
on
within
,
under
the
presidency
of
Mr.
Crackenthorp
,
the
rector
,
assist
by
Squire
Cass
and
other
substantial
parishioner
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
just
occur
to
Mr.
Snell
,
the
landlord
 
<EOS>
he
be
,
as
he
observe
,
a
man
accustomed
to
put
two
and
two
together
 
to
connect
with
the
tinder
-
box
,
which
,
as
deputy
-
constable
,
he
himself
have
have
the
honourable
distinction
of
finding
,
certain
recollection
of
a
pedlar
who
have
call
to
drink
at
the
house
about
a
month
before
,
and
have
actually
state
that
he
carry
a
tinder
-
box
about
with
him
to
light
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
surely
,
be
a
clue
to
be
follow
out
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
memory
,
when
duly
impregnate
with
ascertained
fact
,
be
sometimes
surprisingly
fertile
,
Mr.
Snell
gradually
recover
a
vivid
impression
of
the
effect
produce
on
him
by
the
pedlar
's
countenance
and
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
"
look
with
his
eye
"
which
fall
unpleasantly
on
Mr.
Snell
's
sensitive
organism
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
he
do
not
say
anything
particular
 
<EOS>
no
,
except
that
about
the
tinder
-
box
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
what
a
man
say
,
it
be
the
way
he
say
it
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
he
have
a
swarthy
foreignness
of
complexion
which
bode
little
honesty
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
wear
ear
-
ring
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Crackenthorp
wish
to
know
,
have
some
acquaintance
with
foreign
custom
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
 
stay
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
,
"
say
Mr.
Snell
,
like
a
docile
clairvoyante
,
who
would
really
not
make
a
mistake
if
she
could
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
stretch
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
contract
his
eye
,
as
if
he
be
try
to
see
the
ear
-
ring
,
he
appear
to
give
up
the
effort
,
and
say
,
"
well
,
he
would
get
ear
-
ring
in
his
box
to
sell
,
so
it
be
nat'ral
to
suppose
he
may
wear
'em
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
call
at
every
house
,
a'most
,
in
the
village
;
there
be
somebody
else
,
mayhap
,
see
'em
in
his
ear
,
though
I
can
not
take
upon
me
rightly
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Snell
be
correct
in
his
surmise
,
that
somebody
else
would
remember
the
pedlar
's
ear
-
ring
.
 
<EOS>
for
on
the
spread
of
inquiry
among
the
villager
it
be
state
with
gather
emphasis
,
that
the
parson
have
want
to
know
whether
the
pedlar
wear
ear
-
ring
in
his
ear
,
and
an
impression
be
create
that
a
great
deal
depend
on
the
eliciting
of
this
fact
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
every
one
who
hear
the
question
,
not
have
any
distinct
image
of
the
pedlar
as
_
without
_
ear
-
ring
,
immediately
have
an
image
of
him
_
with
_
ear
-
ring
,
large
or
small
,
as
the
case
may
be
;
and
the
image
be
presently
take
for
a
vivid
recollection
,
so
that
the
glazier
's
wife
,
a
well
-
intentione
woman
,
not
give
to
lying
,
and
whose
house
be
among
the
clean
in
the
village
,
be
ready
to
declare
,
as
sure
as
ever
she
mean
to
take
the
sacrament
the
very
next
Christmas
that
be
ever
come
,
that
she
have
see
big
ear
-
ring
,
in
the
shape
of
the
young
moon
,
in
the
pedlar
's
two
ear
;
while
Jinny
Oates
,
the
cobbler
's
daughter
,
be
a
more
imaginative
person
,
state
not
only
that
she
have
see
them
too
,
but
that
they
have
make
her
blood
creep
,
as
it
do
at
that
very
moment
while
there
she
stand
.
  
<EOS>
also
,
by
way
of
throw
further
light
on
this
clue
of
the
tinder
-
box
,
a
collection
be
make
of
all
the
article
purchase
from
the
pedlar
at
various
house
,
and
carry
to
the
Rainbow
to
be
exhibit
there
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
there
be
a
general
feeling
in
the
village
,
that
for
the
clearing
-
up
of
this
robbery
there
must
be
a
great
deal
do
at
the
Rainbow
,
and
that
no
man
nee
offer
his
wife
an
excuse
for
go
there
while
it
be
the
scene
of
severe
public
duty
.
  
<EOS>
some
disappointment
be
feel
,
and
perhaps
a
little
indignation
also
,
when
it
become
known
that
Silas
Marner
,
on
be
question
by
the
Squire
and
the
parson
,
have
retain
no
other
recollection
of
the
pedlar
than
that
he
have
call
at
his
door
,
but
have
not
enter
his
house
,
have
turn
away
at
once
when
Silas
,
hold
the
door
ajar
,
have
say
that
he
want
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
this
have
be
Silas
's
testimony
,
though
he
clutch
strongly
at
the
idea
of
the
pedlar
's
be
the
culprit
,
if
only
because
it
give
him
a
definite
image
of
a
whereabout
for
his
gold
after
it
have
be
take
away
from
its
hiding
-
place
:
he
could
see
it
now
in
the
pedlar
's
box
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
observe
with
some
irritation
in
the
village
,
that
anybody
but
a
"
blind
creatur
"
like
Marner
would
have
see
the
man
prowl
about
,
for
how
come
he
to
leave
his
tinder
-
box
in
the
ditch
close
by
,
if
he
have
not
be
linger
there
?
 
<EOS>
Doubtless
,
he
have
make
his
observation
when
he
see
Marner
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
anybody
may
know
 
and
only
look
at
him
 
that
the
weaver
be
a
half
-
crazy
miser
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonder
the
pedlar
have
not
murder
him
;
man
of
that
sort
,
with
ring
in
their
ear
,
have
be
know
for
murderer
often
and
often
;
there
have
be
one
try
at
the
'
size
,
not
so
long
ago
but
what
there
be
people
live
who
remember
it
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
Cass
,
indeed
,
enter
the
Rainbow
during
one
of
Mr.
Snell
's
frequently
repeat
recital
of
his
testimony
,
have
treat
it
lightly
,
state
that
he
himself
have
buy
a
pen
-
knife
of
the
pedlar
,
and
think
him
a
merry
grin
fellow
enough
;
it
be
all
nonsense
,
he
say
,
about
the
man
's
evil
look
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
speak
of
in
the
village
as
the
random
talk
of
youth
,
"
as
if
it
be
only
Mr.
Snell
who
have
see
something
odd
about
the
pedlar
!
"
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
there
be
at
least
half
-
a
-
dozen
who
be
ready
to
go
before
Justice
Malam
,
and
give
in
much
more
striking
testimony
than
any
the
landlord
could
furnish
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
hope
Mr.
Godfrey
would
not
go
to
Tarley
and
throw
cold
water
on
what
Mr.
Snell
say
there
,
and
so
prevent
the
justice
from
draw
up
a
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
suspect
of
intend
this
,
when
,
after
mid
-
day
,
he
be
see
set
off
on
horseback
in
the
direction
of
Tarley
.
  
<EOS>
but
by
this
time
Godfrey
's
interest
in
the
robbery
have
fade
before
his
grow
anxiety
about
Dunstan
and
Wildfire
,
and
he
be
go
,
not
to
Tarley
,
but
to
Batherley
,
unable
to
rest
in
uncertainty
about
them
any
longer
.
 
<EOS>
the
possibility
that
Dunstan
have
play
him
the
ugly
trick
of
ride
away
with
Wildfire
,
to
return
at
the
end
of
a
month
,
when
he
have
gamble
away
or
otherwise
squander
the
price
of
the
horse
,
be
a
fear
that
urge
itself
upon
him
more
,
even
,
than
the
thought
of
an
accidental
injury
;
and
now
that
the
dance
at
Mrs.
Osgood
's
be
past
,
he
be
irritated
with
himself
that
he
have
trust
his
horse
to
Dunstan
.
<EOS>
instead
of
try
to
still
his
fear
,
he
encourage
them
,
with
that
superstitious
impression
which
cling
to
us
all
,
that
if
we
expect
evil
very
strongly
it
be
the
less
likely
to
come
;
and
when
he
hear
a
horse
approach
at
a
trot
,
and
see
a
hat
rise
above
a
hedge
beyond
an
angle
of
the
lane
,
he
feel
as
if
his
conjuration
have
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
do
the
horse
come
within
sight
,
than
his
heart
sink
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
Wildfire
;
and
in
a
few
moment
more
he
discern
that
the
rider
be
not
Dunstan
,
but
Bryce
,
who
pull
up
to
speak
,
with
a
face
that
imply
something
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mr.
Godfrey
,
that
be
a
lucky
brother
of
yours

that
Master
Dunsey

I

with
it

him

"
  
<EOS>
"
have
he
throw
him
down
and
break
his
knee
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
Godfrey
,
flush
with
exasperation
.
  
<EOS>
"
bad
than
that
,
"
say
Bryce
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
I
would
make
a
bargain
with
him
to
buy
the
horse
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
 
a
swinging
price
,
but
I
always
like
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
do
he
do
but
go
and
stake
him
 
fly
at
a
hedge
with
stake
in
it
,
atop
of
a
bank
with
a
ditch
before
it
.
<EOS>
the
horse
have
be
dead
a
pretty
good
while
when
he
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
have
not
be
home
since
,
have
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
home
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
"
and
he
would
better
keep
away
.
 
<EOS>
confound
me
for
a
fool
!
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
know
this
would
be
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
"
say
Bryce
,
"
after
I
would
bargain
for
the
horse
,
it
do
come
into
my
head
that
he
may
be
ride
and
sell
the
horse
without
your
knowledge
,
for
I
do
not
believe
it
be
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
Master
Dunsey
be
up
to
his
trick
sometimes
.
<EOS>
but
where
can
he
be
go
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
never
be
see
at
Batherley
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
be
hurt
,
for
he
must
have
walk
off

<EOS>
"
hurt
?
"
 
<EOS>

Godfrey
,
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>

He
will
never
be
hurt
 
he
be
make
to
hurt
other
people

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
_
do
_
give
him
leave
to
sell
the
horse
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
Bryce
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
want
to
part
with
the
horse
 
<EOS>
he
be
always
a
little
too
hard
in
the
mouth
for
me
,
"
say
Godfrey
;
his
pride
make
him
wince
under
the
idea
that
Bryce
guess
the
sale
to
be
a
matter
of
necessity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
see
after
him
 
<EOS>
I
think
some
mischief
have
happen
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
back
now
,
"
he
add
,
turn
the
horse
's
head
,
and
wish
he
could
get
rid
of
Bryce
;
for
he
feel
that
the
long
-
dread
crisis
in
his
life
be
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
come
on
to
Raveloe
,
be
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
no
,
not
now
,
"
say
Bryce
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
be
_
come
round
there
,
for
I
have
to
go
to
Flitton
,
and
I
think
I
may
as
well
take
you
in
my
way
,
and
just
let
you
know
all
I
know
myself
about
the
horse

<EOS>
I
suppose
Master
Dunsey
do
not
like
to
show
himself
till
the
ill
news
have
blow
over
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
perhaps
go
to
pay
a
visit
at
the
Three
Crowns
,
by
Whitbridge
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
he
be
fond
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
be
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
rather
absently
.
 
<EOS>
then
rouse
himself
,
he
say
,
with
an
effort
at
carelessness
,
"
We
shall
hear
of
him
soon
enough
,
I
will
be
bind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
here
be
my
turning
,
"
say
Bryce
,
not
surprised
to
perceive
that
Godfrey
be
rather
"
down
"
;
"
so
I
will
bid
you
good
-
day
,
and
wish
I
may
bring
you
well
news
another
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
ride
along
slowly
,
represent
to
himself
the
scene
of
confession
to
his
father
from
which
he
feel
that
there
be
now
no
longer
any
escape
.
 
<EOS>
the
revelation
about
the
money
must
be
make
the
very
next
morning
;
and
if
he
withhold
the
rest
,
Dunstan
would
be
sure
to
come
back
shortly
,
and
,
find
that
he
must
bear
the
brunt
of
his
father
's
anger
,
would
tell
the
whole
story
out
of
spite
,
even
though
he
have
nothing
to
gain
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
step
,
perhaps
,
by
which
he
may
still
win
Dunstan
's
silence
and
put
off
the
evil
day
:
he
may
tell
his
father
that
he
have
himself
spend
the
money
pay
to
him
by
Fowler
;
and
as
he
have
never
be
guilty
of
such
an
offence
before
,
the
affair
would
blow
over
after
a
little
storming
.
<EOS>
but
Godfrey
could
not
bend
himself
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
that
in
let
Dunstan
have
the
money
,
he
have
already
be
guilty
of
a
breach
of
trust
hardly
less
culpable
than
that
of
spend
the
money
directly
for
his
own
behoof
;
and
yet
there
be
a
distinction
between
the
two
act
which
make
him
feel
that
the
one
be
so
much
more
blackening
than
the
other
as
to
be
intolerable
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
good
fellow
,
"
he
say
to
himself
;
"
but
I
be
not
a
scoundrel
 
at
least
,
I
will
stop
short
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
bear
the
consequence
of
what
I
_
have
_
do
sooner
than
make
<EOS>
believe
I
have
do
what
I
never
would
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
never
have
spend
the
money
for
my
own
pleasure
 
<EOS>
I
be
torture
into
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
through
the
remainder
of
this
day
Godfrey
,
with
only
occasional
fluctuation
,
keep
his
will
bent
in
the
direction
of
a
complete
avowal
to
his
father
,
and
he
withhold
the
story
of
Wildfire
's
loss
till
the
next
morning
,
that
it
may
serve
him
as
an
introduction
to
heavy
matter
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
Squire
be
accustom
to
his
son
's
frequent
absence
from
home
,
and
think
neither
Dunstan
's
nor
Wildfire
's
non
-
appearance
a
matter
call
for
remark
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
say
to
himself
again
and
again
,
that
if
he
let
slip
this
one
opportunity
of
confession
,
he
may
never
have
another
;
the
revelation
may
be
make
even
in
a
more
odious
way
than
by
Dunstan
's
malignity
:
_
she
_
may
come
as
she
have
threaten
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
try
to
make
the
scene
easy
to
himself
by
rehearsal
:
he
make
up
his
mind
how
he
would
pass
from
the
admission
of
his
weakness
in
let
Dunstan
have
the
money
to
the
fact
that
Dunstan
have
a
hold
on
him
which
he
have
be
unable
to
shake
off
,
and
how
he
would
work
up
his
father
to
expect
something
very
bad
before
he
tell
him
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
Squire
be
an
implacable
man
:
he
make
resolution
in
violent
anger
,
and
he
be
not
to
be
move
from
them
after
his
anger
have
subside
 
as
fiery
volcanic
matter
cool
and
harden
into
rock
.
 
<EOS>
like
many
violent
and
implacable
man
,
he
allow
evil
to
grow
under
favour
of
his
own
heedlessness
,
till
they
press
upon
him
with
exasperating
force
,
and
then
he
turn
round
with
fierce
severity
and
become
unrelentingly
hard
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
his
system
with
his
tenant
:
he
allow
them
to
get
into
arrear
,
neglect
their
fence
,
reduce
their
stock
,
sell
their
straw
,
and
otherwise
go
the
wrong
way
,
 
and
<EOS>
then
,
when
he
become
short
of
money
in
consequence
of
this
indulgence
,
he
take
the
hard
measure
and
would
listen
to
no
appeal
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
know
all
this
,
and
feel
it
with
the
great
force
because
he
have
constantly
suffer
annoyance
from
witness
his
father
's
sudden
fit
of
unrelentingness
,
for
which
his
own
habitual
irresolution
deprive
him
of
all
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
(
He
be
not
critical
on
the
faulty
indulgence
which
precede
these
fit
;
_
that
_
seem
to
him
natural
enough
.
)
 
<EOS>
still
there
be
just
the
chance
,
Godfrey
think
,
that
his
father
's
pride
may
see
this
marriage
in
a
light
that
would
induce
him
to
hush
it
up
,
rather
than
turn
his
son
out
and
make
the
family
the
talk
of
the
country
for
ten
mile
round
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
view
of
the
case
that
Godfrey
manage
to
keep
before
him
pretty
closely
till
midnight
,
and
he
go
to
sleep
think
that
he
have
do
with
inward
debating
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
he
awake
in
the
still
morning
darkness
he
find
it
impossible
to
reawaken
his
evening
thought
;
it
be
as
if
they
have
be
tire
out
and
be
not
to
be
rouse
to
further
work
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
argument
for
confession
,
he
could
now
feel
the
presence
of
nothing
but
its
evil
consequence
:
the
old
dread
of
disgrace
come
back
 
the
old
shrinking
from
the
thought
of
raise
a
hopeless
barrier
between
himself
and
Nancy
 
the
old
disposition
to
rely
on
chance
which
may
be
favourable
to
him
,
and
save
him
from
betrayal
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
after
all
,
should
he
cut
off
the
hope
of
them
by
his
own
act
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
see
the
matter
in
a
wrong
light
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
a
rage
with
Dunstan
,
and
have
think
of
nothing
but
a
thorough
break
-
up
of
their
mutual
understanding
;
but
what
it
would
be
really
wisest
for
him
to
do
,
be
to
try
and
soften
his
father
's
anger
against
Dunsey
,
and
keep
thing
as
nearly
as
possible
in
their
old
condition
.
<EOS>
if
Dunsey
do
not
come
back
for
a
few
day
(
and
Godfrey
do
not
know
but
that
the
rascal
have
enough
money
in
his
pocket
to
enable
him
to
keep
away
still
longer
)
,
everything
may
blow
over
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
rise
and
take
his
own
breakfast
earlier
than
usual
,
but
linger
in
the
wainscoted
parlour
till
his
young
brother
have
finish
their
meal
and
go
out
;
await
his
father
,
who
always
take
a
walk
with
his
managing
-
man
before
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
every
one
breakfast
at
a
different
hour
in
the
Red
House
,
and
the
Squire
be
always
the
late
,
give
a
long
chance
to
a
rather
feeble
morning
appetite
before
he
try
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
table
have
be
spread
with
substantial
eatable
nearly
two
hour
before
he
present
himself
 
a
tall
,
stout
man
of
sixty
,
with
a
face
in
which
the
knit
brow
and
rather
hard
glance
seem
contradict
by
the
slack
and
feeble
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
His
person
show
mark
of
habitual
neglect
,
his
dress
be
slovenly
;
and
yet
there
be
something
in
the
presence
of
the
old
Squire
distinguishable
from
that
of
the
ordinary
farmer
in
the
parish
,
who
be
perhaps
every
whit
as
refined
as
he
,
but
,
have
slouch
their
way
through
life
with
a
consciousness
of
be
in
the
vicinity
of
their
"
better
"
,
want
that
self
-
possession
and
authoritativeness
of
voice
and
carriage
which
belong
to
a
man
who
think
of
superior
as
remote
existence
with
whom
he
have
personally
little
more
to
do
than
with
America
or
the
star
.
 
<EOS>
the
Squire
have
be
use
to
parish
homage
all
his
life
,
use
to
the
presupposition
that
his
family
,
his
tankard
,
and
everything
that
be
his
,
be
the
old
and
good
;
and
as
he
never
associate
with
any
gentry
higher
than
himself
,
his
opinion
be
not
disturb
by
comparison
.
  
<EOS>
He
glance
at
his
son
as
he
enter
the
room
,
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
what
,
sir
!
<EOS>
have
not
_
<EOS>
you
_
have
your
breakfast
yet
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
pleasant
morning
greeting
between
them
;
not
because
of
any
unfriendliness
,
but
because
the
sweet
flower
of
courtesy
be
not
a
growth
of
such
home
as
the
Red
House
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
"
I
have
have
my
breakfast
,
but
I
be
wait
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
the
Squire
,
throw
himself
indifferently
into
his
chair
,
and
speak
in
a
ponderous
coughing
fashion
,
which
be
feel
in
Raveloe
to
be
a
sort
of
privilege
of
his
rank
,
while
he
cut
a
piece
of
beef
,
and
hold
it
up
before
the
deer
-
hound
that
have
come
in
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
re
the
bell
for
my
ale
,
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
youngster
'
business
be
your
own
pleasure
,
mostly
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
hurry
about
it
for
anybody
but
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Squire
's
life
be
quite
as
idle
as
his
son
'
,
but
it
be
a
fiction
keep
up
by
himself
and
his
contemporary
in
Raveloe
that
youth
be
exclusively
the
period
of
folly
,
and
that
their
aged
wisdom
be
constantly
in
a
state
of
endurance
mitigate
by
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
wait
,
before
he
speak
again
,
until
the
ale
have
be
bring
and
the
door
close
 
an
interval
during
which
Fleet
,
the
deer
-
hound
,
have
consume
enough
bit
of
beef
to
make
a
poor
man
's
holiday
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
be
a
cursed
piece
of
ill
-
luck
with
Wildfire
,
"
he
begin
;
"
happen
the
day
before
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
 
<EOS>
break
his
knee
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
the
Squire
,
after
take
a
draught
of
ale
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
know
how
to
ride
better
than
that
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
never
throw
a
horse
down
in
my
life

<EOS>
if
I
have

I
may
ha

whistle
for
another

my
_
father
be
not
quite
so
ready
to
unstre
as
some
other
father
I
know

they
must
turn
over
a
new

there
be

not

I

<EOS>
the
Squire
have
deliver
this
speech
in
a
cough
and
interrupted
manner
,
but
with
no
pause
long
enough
for
Godfrey
to
make
it
a
pretext
for
take
up
the
word
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
that
his
father
mean
to
ward
off
any
request
for
money
on
the
ground
of
the
misfortune
with
Wildfire
,
and
that
the
emphasis
he
have
thus
be
lead
to
lay
on
his
shortness
of
cash
and
his
arrear
be
likely
to
produce
an
attitude
of
mind
the
utmost
unfavourable
for
his
own
disclosure
.
<EOS>
but
he
must
go
on
,
now
he
have
begin
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
bad
than
break
the
horse
's
knee

be
stake
and
kill
,

he
say
,
as
soon
as

father
be
silent
,

have
begin
to
cut
his
meat
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
not

of

you
to
buy
me
another
horse

only

I
would
lose
the

of

you

the
price
of
Wildfire

do

Dunsey
take
him
to
the

him
for
me
the
other
day

after

would
make
a
bargain
for
a
hundred

twenty

Bryce
,
he
go
after
the
hound
,

take
some
fool

leap
or
other
that
do
for
the
horse
at
once

down

be
stare
at
his
son
in
amazement
,
not
be
sufficiently
quick
of
brain
to
form
a
probable
guess
as
to
what
could
have
cause
so
strange
an
inversion
of
the
paternal
and
filial
relation
as
this
proposition
of
his
son
to

him
a
hundred

up

leave

relieve

end

have
make
any
change
in

more
uneasy
that

have
entangle
himself
still
further
in
prevarication

deceit

<EOS>
what
have
pass
about
his
proposing
to
Nancy
have
raise
a
new
alarm
,
lest
by
some
after
-
dinner
word
of
his
father
's
to
Mr.
Lammeter
<EOS>
he
should
be
throw
into
the
embarrassment
of
be
oblige
absolutely
to
decline
her
when
she
seem
to
be
within
his
reach
.
 
<EOS>
He
flee
to
his
usual
refuge
,
that
of
hope
for
some
unforeseen
turn
of
fortune
,
some
favourable
chance
which
would
save
him
from
unpleasant
consequence
 
perhaps
even
justify
his
insincerity
by
manifest
its
prudence
.

in
this
point
of
trust
to
some
throw
of
fortune
's
dice

Godfrey
can
hardly
be
call
specially
old
-
fashioned

Favourable
Chance
<EOS>
,
I
fancy
,
be
the
god
of
all
man
who
follow
their
own
device
instead
of
obey
a
law
they
believe
in
.
 
<EOS>
let
even
a
polished
man
of
these
day
get
into
a
position
he
be
ashamed
to
avow
,
and
his
mind
will
be
bent
on
all
the
possible
issue
that
may
deliver
him
from
the
calculable
result
of
that
position

him
live
outside

shirk
the

presently
find
himself
dream
of

a

his

anchor
himself
on
the

the

may
turn
out
not

let

betray

he
will
adore

Chance

forsake
a
decent

that
he
may
pursue
the
gentility
of
a
profession
to
which
nature
never

and
his

will
infallibly
be
the
worship
of

Chance

which
he
will
believe
in

the

<EOS>
Justice
Malam
be
naturally
regard
in
Tarley
and
Raveloe
as
a
man
of
capacious
mind
,
see
that
he
could
draw
much
wide
conclusion
without
evidence
than
could
be
expect
of
his
neighbour
who
be
not
on
the
Commission
of
the
Peace
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
man
be
not
likely
to
neglect
the
clue
of
the
tinder
-
box
,
and
an
inquiry
be
set
on
foot
concern
a
pedlar
,
name
unknown
,
with
curly
black
hair
and
a
foreign
complexion
,
carry
a
box
of
cutlery
and
jewellery
,
and
wear
large
ring
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
but
either
because
inquiry
be
too
slow
-
footed
to
overtake
him
,
or
because
the
description
apply
to
so
many
pedlar
that
inquiry
do
not
know
how
to
choose
among
them
,
week
pass
away
,
and
there
be
no
other
result
concern
the
robbery
than
a
gradual
cessation
of
the
excitement
it
have
cause
in
Raveloe
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
Cass
's
absence
be
hardly
a
subject
of
remark
:
he
have
once
before
have
a
quarrel
with
his
father
,
and
have
go
off
,
nobody
know
whither
,
to
return
at
the
end
of
six
week
,
take
up
his
old
quarter
unforbidden
,
and
swagger
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
His
own
family
,
who
equally
expect
this
issue
,
with
the
sole
difference
that
the
Squire
be
determine
this
time
to
forbid
him
the
old
quarter
,
never
mention
his
absence
;
and
when
his
uncle
Kimble
or
Mr.
Osgood
notice
it
,
the
story
of
his
have
kill
Wildfire
,
and
commit
some
offence
against
his
father
,
be
enough
to
prevent
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
to
connect
the
fact
of
Dunsey
's
disappearance
with
that
of
the
robbery
occur
on
the
same
day
,
lie
quite
away
from
the
track
of
every
one
's
think
 
<EOS>
even
Godfrey
's
,
who
have
well
reason
than
any
one
else
to
know
what
his
brother
be
capable
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
remember
no
mention
of
the
weaver
between
them
since
the
time
,
twelve
year
ago
,
when
it
be
their
boyish
sport
to
deride
him
;
and
,
besides
,
his
imagination
constantly
create
an
_
alibi
_
for
Dunstan
:
he
see
him
continually
in
some
congenial
haunt
,
to
which
he
have
walk
off
on
leave
Wildfire
 
<EOS>
see
him
sponge
on
chance
acquaintance
,
and
meditate
a
return
home
to
the
old
amusement
of
torment
his
eld
brother
.
 
<EOS>
even
if
any
brain
in
Raveloe
have
put
the
say
two
fact
together
,
I
doubt
whether
a
combination
so
injurious
to
the
prescriptive
respectability
of
a
family
with
a
mural
monument
and
venerable
tankard
,
would
not
have
be
suppress
as
of
unsound
tendency
.
 
<EOS>
but
Christmas
pudding
,
brawn
,
and
abundance
of
spirituous
liquor
,
throw
the
mental
originality
into
the
channel
of
nightmare
,
be
great
preservative
against
a
dangerous
spontaneity
of
wake
thought
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
robbery
be
talk
of
at
the
Rainbow
and
elsewhere
,
in
good
company
,
the
balance
continue
to
waver
between
the
rational
explanation
found
on
the
tinder
-
box
,
and
the
theory
of
an
impenetrable
mystery
that
mock
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
the
advocate
of
the
tinder
-
box
-
and
-
pedlar
view
consider
the
other
side
a
muddle
-
headed
and
credulous
set
,
who
,
because
they
themselves
be
wall
-
eyed
,
suppose
everybody
else
to
have
the
same
blank
outlook
;
and
the
adherent
of
the
inexplicable
more
than
hint
that
their
antagonist
be
animal
incline
to
crow
before
they
have
find
any
corn
 
<EOS>
mere
skimming
-
dish
in
point
of
depth
 
whose
clear
-
sightedness
consist
in
supposing
there
be
nothing
behind
a
barn
-
door
because
they
could
not
see
through
it
;
so
that
,
though
their
controversy
do
not
serve
to
elicit
the
fact
concern
the
robbery
,
it
elicit
some
true
opinion
of
collateral
importance
.
  
<EOS>
but
while
poor
Silas
's
loss
serve
thus
to
brush
the
slow
current
of
Raveloe
conversation
,
Silas
himself
be
feel
the
wither
desolation
of
that
bereavement
about
which
his
neighbour
be
argue
at
their
ease
.
 
<EOS>
to
any
one
who
have
observe
him
before
he
lose
his
gold
,
it
may
have
seem
that
so
withered
and
shrink
a
life
as
his
could
hardly
be
susceptible
of
a
bruise
,
could
hardly
endure
any
subtraction
but
such
as
would
put
an
end
to
it
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
reality
it
have
be
an
eager
life
,
fill
with
immediate
purpose
which
fence
him
in
from
the
wide
,
cheerless
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
cling
life
;
and
though
the
object
round
which
<EOS>
its
fibre
have
cling
be
a
dead
disrupted
thing
,
it
satisfy
the
need
for
cling
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
the
fence
be
break
down
 
<EOS>
the
support
be
snatch
away
.
 
<EOS>
Marner
's
thought
could
no
longer
move
in
their
old
round
,
and
be
baffle
by
a
blank
like
that
which
meet
a
plod
ant
when
the
earth
have
break
away
on
its
homeward
path
.
 
<EOS>
the
loom
be
there
,
and
the
weaving
,
and
the
grow
pattern
in
the
cloth
;
but
the
bright
treasure
in
the
hole
under
his
foot
be
go
;
the
prospect
of
handle
and
count
it
be
go
:
the
evening
have
no
phantasm
of
delight
to
still
the
poor
soul
's
craving
.
 
<EOS>
the
thought
of
the
money
he
would
get
by
his
actual
work
could
bring
no
joy
,
for
its
meagre
image
be
only
a
fresh
reminder
of
his
loss
;
and
hope
be
too
heavily
crush
by
the
sudden
blow
for
his
imagination
to
dwell
on
the
growth
of
a
new
hoard
from
that
small
beginning
.
  
<EOS>
He
fill
up
the
blank
with
grief
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
sit
weave
,
he
every
now
and
then
moan
low
,
like
one
in
pain
<EOS>
:
it
be
the
sign
that
his
thought
have
come
round
again
to
the
sudden
chasm
 
to
the
empty
evening
-
time
.
<EOS>
and
all
the
evening
,
as
he
sit
in
his
loneliness
by
his
dull
fire
,
he
lean
his
elbow
on
his
knee
,
and
clasp
his
head
with
his
hand
,
and
moan
very
low
 
not
as
one
who
seek
to
be
hear
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
he
be
not
utterly
forsaken
in
his
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
the
repulsion
Marner
have
always
create
in
his
neighbour
be
partly
dissipate
by
the
new
light
in
which
this
misfortune
have
show
him
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
a
man
who
have
more
cunning
than
honest
folk
could
come
by
,
and
,
what
be
bad
,
have
not
the
inclination
to
use
that
cunne
in
a
neighbourly
way
,
it
be
now
apparent
that
Silas
have
not
cunne
enough
to
keep
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
generally
speak
of
as
a
"
poor
mushed
creatur
"
;
and
that
avoidance
of
his
neighbour
,
which
have
before
be
refer
to
his
ill
-
will
and
to
a
probable
addiction
to
bad
company
,
be
now
consider
mere
craziness
.
  
<EOS>
this
change
to
a
kindly
feeling
be
show
in
various
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
odour
of
Christmas
cooking
be
on
the
wind
<EOS>
,
it
be
the
season
when
superfluous
pork
and
black
pudding
be
suggestive
of
charity
in
well
-
to
-
do
family
;
and
Silas
's
misfortune
have
bring
him
uppermost
in
the
memory
of
housekeeper
like
Mrs.
Osgood
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crackenthorp
,
too
,
while
he
admonish
Silas
that
his
money
have
probably
be
take
from
him
because
he
think
too
much
of
it
and
never
come
to
church
,
enforce
the
doctrine
by
a
present
of
pig
'
pettitoe
,
well
calculated
to
dissipate
unfounded
prejudice
against
the
clerical
character
.
<EOS>
neighbour
who
have
nothing
but
verbal
consolation
to
give
show
a
disposition
not
only
to
greet
Silas
and
discuss
his
misfortune
at
some
length
when
they
encounter
him
in
the
village
,
but
also
to
take
the
trouble
of
call
at
his
cottage
and
get
him
to
repeat
all
the
detail
on
the
very
spot
;
and
then
they
would
try
to
cheer
him
by
say
,
"
well
,
Master
Marner
,
you
be
no
bad
off
nor
other
poor
folk
,
after
all
;
and
if
you
be
to
be
cripple
,
the
parish
'
ud
give
you
a
'
lowance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
one
reason
why
we
be
seldom
able
to
comfort
our
neighbour
with
our
word
be
that
our
goodwill
get
adulterate
,
in
spite
of
ourselves
,
before
it
can
pass
our
lip
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
send
black
pudding
and
pettitoe
without
give
them
a
flavour
of
our
own
egoism
;
but
language
be
a
stream
that
be
almost
sure
to
smack
of
a
mingled
soil
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
fair
proportion
of
kindness
in
Raveloe
;
but
it
be
often
of
a
beery
and
bungling
sort
,
and
take
the
shape
least
ally
to
the
complimentary
and
hypocritical
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Macey
,
for
example
,
come
one
evening
expressly
to
let
Silas
know
that
recent
event
have
give
him
the
advantage
of
stand
more
favourably
in
the
opinion
of
a
man
whose
judgment
be
not
form
lightly
,
open
the
conversation
by
say
,
as
soon
as
he
have
seat
himself
and
adjust
his
thumb
    
"
come
,
Master
Marner
,
why
,
you
have
no
call
to
sit
a
-
moaning
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
a
deal
better
off
to
ha
'
lose
your
money
,
nor
to
ha
'
kep
it
by
foul
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
think
,
when
you
first
come
into
these
part
,
as
you
be
no
well
nor
you
should
be
;
you
be
young
a
deal
than
what
you
be
now
;
but
you
be
allay
a
staring
,
white
-
face
creatur
,
partly
like
a
bald
-
faced
calf
,
as
I
may
say
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
knowing
<EOS>
:
it
be
not
every
queer
-
looksed
thing
as
Old
Harry
's
have
the
making
of
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
speak
o
'
toad
and
such
;
for
they
be
often
harmless
,
like
,
and
useful
against
varmin
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
pretty
much
the
same
wi
'
you
,
as
fur
as
I
can
see
.
 
<EOS>
though
as
to
the
yarb
and
stuff
to
cure
the
breathing
,
if
you
bring
that
sort
o
'
knowledge
from
distant
part
,
you
may
ha
'
be
a
bit
free
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
if
the
knowledge
be
not
well
come
by
<EOS>
,
why
,
you
may
ha
'
make
up
for
it
by
come
to
church
reg'lar
;
for
,
as
for
the
child
as
the
Wise
Woman
charm
,
I
have
be
at
the
christening
of
'em
again
and
again
,
and
they
take
the
water
just
as
well
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
reasonable
;
for
if
Old
Harry
's
a
mind
to
do
a
bit
o
'
kindness
for
a
holiday
,
like
,
who
be
get
anything
against
it
?
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
thinking
;
and
I
have
be
clerk
o
'
<EOS>
this
parish
forty
year
,
<EOS>
and
I
know
,
when
the
parson
and
me
do
the
cussing
of
a
Ash
<EOS>
Wednesday
,
there
be
no
cuss
o

folk
as
have
a
mind
to
be
cure
without
a
doctor
,
let
Kimble
say
what
he
will
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
Master
Marner
,
as
I
be
say
 
for
there
be
winding
<EOS>
i

thing
as
they
may
carry
you
to
<EOS>
the
fur
end
o

<EOS>
the
prayer
-
book
afore
you
get
back
to

<EOS>
my
advice
be
,
as
you
keep
up
your
sperrit
;
for
as
for
think
you
be
a
deep
un
,
and
ha
'
get
more
inside
you
nor
'
ull
bear
daylight
<EOS>
,
I
be
not
o
'
<EOS>
that
opinion
at
all
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
tell
the
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
say
I
,
you
talk
o
'
Master
Marner
make
out
a
tale
 
<EOS>
why
,
it
be
nonsense
,
that
is
:
<EOS>
it
'
ud
take
a
'
cute
man
to
make
a
tale
like
that
;
and
,
say
I
,
he
look
as
scared
as
a
rabbit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
during
this
discursive
address
Silas
have
continue
motionless
in
his
previous
attitude
,
lean
his
elbow
on
his
knee
,
and
press
his
hand
against
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Macey
,
not
doubt
that
he
have
be
listen
to
,
pause
,
in
the
expectation
of
some
appreciatory
reply
,
but
Marner
remain
silent
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
sense
that
the
old
man
mean
to
be
good
-
natured
and
neighbourly
;
but
the
kindness
fall
on
him
as
sunshine
fall
on
the
wretched
 
he
have
no
heart
to
taste
it
,
and
feel
that
it
be
very
far
off
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
Master
Marner
,
have
you
get
nothing
to
say
to
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
Mr.
Macey
at
last
,
with
a
slight
accent
of
impatience
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
Marner
,
slowly
,
shake
his
head
between
his

I

you
 
thank

I

say
Mr.

and
my
advice
be
 
<EOS>
have
you
get
a
Sunday
suit
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

say
Marner

<EOS>
"
I
doubt
it
be
so
,
"
say
Mr.
Macey

<EOS>
"
now
,
let
me
advise
you
to
get
a
Sunday
suit

there
be
Tookey
,
he
be
a
poor
creatur
,
but
he
be
get
my
tailoring
business
,
and
some
o
'
<EOS>
my
money
in
it
,
and
he
shall
make
a
suit
at

give
you
trust
,
and
then
you
can
come
to
church
,
and
be
a
bit
neighbourly
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
you
have
never
hear
me
say
"
amen
"
since
you
come
into
these
part
,
and
I
recommend
you
to
lose
no
time
,
for
it
will
be
poor
work
when
Tookey
have
it
all
to
himself
,
for
I
may
not

equil
to
stand
i

the
desk
at
all
<EOS>
,
come
another
winter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
Mr.
Macey
pause
,
perhaps
expect
some
sign
of
emotion
in
his
hearer
;
but
not
observe
any
,
he
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
and
as
for
the
money
for
the
suit

,
why
,
you
get
a
matter
of
a
pound
a

week
at
your
weaving
,
Master
Marner
,
and
you
be
a
young
man
,
eh
,
for
all
you
look
so
mushed
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
you
could
not

five

twenty
when
you
come

"
  
<EOS>
Silas
start
a
little
at
the
change
to
a
question
tone
,
and
answer
mildly
,
"
I
do
not
know
;
I
can
not
rightly
say
 
it
be
a
long
while
since
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
receive
such
an
answer
as
this
,
it
be
not
surprising
that
Mr.
Macey
observe
,
later
on
in
the
evening
at
the
Rainbow
,
that
Marner
's
head
be
"
all
of
a
muddle
"
,
and
that
it
be
to
be
doubt
if
he
ever
know
when
Sunday
come
round
,
which
show
him
a
bad
heathen
than
many
a
dog
.
  
<EOS>
another
of
Silas
's
comforter
,
besides
Mr.
Macey
,
come
to
him
with
a
mind
highly
charge
on
the
same
topic
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
the
wheelwright
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
of
Raveloe
be
not
severely
regular
in
their
church
-
go
,
and
perhaps
there
be
hardly
a
person
in
the
parish
who
would
not
have
hold
that
to
go
to
church
every
Sunday
in
the
calendar
would
have
show
a
greedy
desire
to
stand
well
with
Heaven
,
and
get
an
undue
advantage
over
their
neighbour
 
a
wish
to
be
well
than
the
"
common
run
"
,
that
would
have
imply
a
reflection
on
those
who
have
have
godfather
and
godmother
as
well
as
themselves
,
and
have
an
equal
right
to
the
burying
-
service
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
it
be
understand
to
be
requisite
for
all
who
be
not
household
servant
,
or
young
man
,
to
take
the
sacrament
at
one
of
the
great
festival
:
<EOS>
Squire
Cass
himself
take
it
on
Christmas
-
day
;
while
those
who
be
hold
to
be
"
good
liver
"
go
to
church
with
great
,
though
still
with
moderate
,
frequency
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Winthrop
be
one
of
these
:
she
be
in
all
respect
a
woman
of
scrupulous
conscience
,
so
eager
for
duty
that
life
seem
to
offer
them
too
scantily
unless
she
rise
at
half
-
past
four
,
though
this
throw
a
scarcity
of
work
over
the
more
advanced
hour
of
the
morning
,
which
it
be
a
constant
problem
with
her
to
remove
.
 
<EOS>
yet
she
have
not
the
vixenish
temper
which
be
sometimes
suppose
to
be
a
necessary
condition
of
such
habit
<EOS>
:
she
be
a
very
mild
,
patient
woman
,
whose
nature
it
be
to
seek
out
all
the
sad
and
more
serious
element
of
life
,
and
pasture
her
mind
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
the
person
<EOS>
always
first
thought
of
in
Raveloe
when
there
be
illness
or
death
in
a
family
,
when
leech
be
to
be
apply
,
or
there
be
a
sudden
disappointment
in
a
monthly
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
"
comfortable
woman
"
 
<EOS>
good
-
looking
,
fresh
-
complexioned
,
have
her
lip
always
slightly
screw
,
as
if
she
feel
herself
in
a
sick
-
room
with
the
doctor
or
the
clergyman
present
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
never
whimper
;
no
one
have
see
her
shed
tear
;
she
be
simply
grave
and
inclined
to
shake
her
head
and
sigh
,
almost
imperceptibly
,
like
a
funereal
mourner
who
be
not
a
relation
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
surprising
that
Ben
Winthrop
,
who
love
his
quart
-
pot
and
his
joke
,
get
along
so
well
with
Dolly
;
but
she
take
her
husband
's
joke
and
joviality
as
patiently
as
everything
else
,
consider
that
"
man
_
would
_
be
so
"
,
and
view
the
strong
sex
in
the
light
of
animal
whom
it
have
please
Heaven
to
make
naturally
troublesome
,
like
bull
and
turkey
-
cock
.
  
<EOS>
this
good
wholesome
woman
could
hardly
fail
to
have
her
mind
draw
strongly
towards
Silas
Marner
,
now
that
he
appear
in
the
light
of
a
sufferer
;
and
one
Sunday
afternoon
she
take
her
little
boy
Aaron
with
her
,
and
go
to
call
on
Silas
,
carry
in
her
hand
some
small
lard
-
cake
,
flat
paste
-
like
article
much
esteem
in
Raveloe
.
<EOS>
Aaron
,
an
apple
-
cheek
youngster
of
seven
,
with
a
clean
starched
frill
which
look
like
a
plate
for
the
apple
,
need
all
his
adventurous
curiosity
to
embolden
him
against
the
possibility
that
the
big
-
eyed
weaver
may
do
him
some
bodily
injury
;
and
his
dubiety
be
much
increase
when
,
on
arrive
at
the
Stone
-
pit
,
they
hear
the
mysterious
sound
of
the
loom
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
it
be
as
I
think
,
"
say
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
to
knock
loudly
before
Silas
hear
them
;
but
when
he
do
come
to
the
door
he
show
no
impatience
,
as
he
would
once
have
do
,
at
a
visit
that
have
be
unasked
for
and
unexpected
.
<EOS>
formerly
,
his
heart
have
be
as
a

with
its

but
now
the
casket
be
empty

and
the
lock
be
break

<EOS>
leave
grope
in
darkness
,
with
his
prop
utterly
go
,
Silas
have
inevitably
a
sense
,
though
a
dull
and
half
-
despair
one
,
that
if
any
help
come
to
him
it
must
come
from
without
;
and
there
be
a
slight
stirring
of
expectation
at
the
sight
of
his
fellow

man
,
a
faint
consciousness
of
dependence
on
their
goodwill
.
<EOS>
He
open
the
door
wide
to
admit
Dolly

but
without
otherwise
return
her
greeting
than
by
move
the
armchair
a
few

a
sign

be

there
be
no

misunderstand
the

give
comfort
that
make
itself

say
,
with
more
feeling

he
lay
down

Poor
Dolly
's
exposition
of
her
simple
Raveloe
theology
fall
rather
unmeaningly
on
Silas
's
ear
,
for
there
be
no
word
in
it
that
could
rouse
a
memory
of
what
he
have
know
as
religion
,
and
his
comprehension
be
quite
baffle
by
the
plural
pronoun
,
which
be
no
heresy
of
Dolly
's
,
but
only
her
way
of
avoid
a
presumptuous
familiarity
.
 
<EOS>
He
remain
silent
,
not
feel
inclined
to
assent
to
the
part
of
Dolly
's
speech
which
he
fully
understand
 
her
recommendation
that
he
should
go
to
church
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Silas
be
so
unaccustomed
to
talk
beyond
the
brief
question
and
answer
necessary
for
the
transaction
of
his
simple
business
,
that
word
do
not
easily
come
to
him
without
the
urgency
of
a
distinct
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
,
little
Aaron
,
have
become
used
to
the
weaver
's
awful
presence
,
have
advance
to
his
mother
's
side
,
and
<EOS>
Silas
,
seem
to
notice
him
for
the
first

try
to
return
Dolly
's
sign
of
good
-
will
by
offer
the
lad
a
bit
of
lard
-
cake
.
 
<EOS>
Aaron
shrink
back
a
little
,
and
rub
his
head
against
his
mother
's
shoulder
,
but
still
think
the
piece
of
cake
worth
the
risk
of
put
his
hand
out
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
for
shame
,
Aaron
,
"
say
his

take
him
on

He

she
go

that

He

<EOS>
She
stroke
Aaron

Master
Marner
good
to

Marner
,
on

see
the
neat

rosy
face

you

he
can
sing
a

carril

I
take
it
for
a

come

Aaron
be
not
indispose
to
display
his
talent

even
to
an
ogre
,
under
protect
circumstance
;
and
after
a
few
more
sign
of
coyness
,
consist
chiefly
in
rub
the
back

his
hand
over
his
eye

then
peep
between

at

to

so
that

he
begin
with

listen
with

<EOS>
the
Christmas
carol
,
with
its
hammer
-
like
rhythm
,
have
fall
on
his
ear

strange
music

quite
unlike
a

could
have
none

but
he
want
to
show
her

I
beg

pray
of
you
to
leave
off
weaving
of
a
Sunday

Silas
say
"
good

thank
you
kindly

"
as
he
open
the
door
for
Dolly
,
but
he
could
not
help
feel
relieved
when
she
be
go
 
relieve
that
he
may
weave
again
and
moan
at
his
ease

<EOS>
Her
simple
view
of
life
and
its
comfort
,
by
which
she
have
try
to
cheer
him
,
be
only
like
a
report
of
unknown
object
,
which
his
imagination
could
not
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
the
fountain
of
human
love
and
of
faith
in
a
divine
love
have
not
yet
be
unlock
,
and
his
soul
be
still
the
shrink
rivulet
,
with
only
this
difference
,
that
its
little
groove
of
sand
be
block
up

and
it
wander
confusedly
against
dark
obstruction

<EOS>
and
so
,
notwithstanding
the
honest
persuasion
of
Mr.
Macey
and
Dolly
Winthrop
,
Silas
spend
his
Christmas
-
day
in
loneliness
,
eat
his
meat
in
sadness
of
heart
,
though
the
meat
have
come
to
him
as
a
neighbourly
present
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
he
look
out
on
the
black
frost
that
seem
to
press
cruelly
on
every
blade
of
grass
,
while
the
half
-
icy
red
pool
shiver
under
the
bitter
wind
;
but
towards
evening
the
snow
begin
to
fall
,
and
curtain
from
him
even
that
dreary
outlook
,
shut
him
close
up
with
his
narrow
grief
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
sit
in
his
robbed
home
through
the
livelong
evening
,
not
care
to
close
his
shutter
or
lock
his
door
,
press
his
head
between
his
hand
and
moan
,
till
the
cold
grasp
him
and
tell
him
that
his
fire
be
grey
.
  
<EOS>
nobody
in
this
world
but
himself
know
that
he
be
the
same
Silas
Marner
who
have
once
love
his
fellow
with
tender
love
,
and
trust
in
an
unseen
goodness

<EOS>
even
to
himself
that
past

have
become
dim

<EOS>
but
in
Raveloe
village
the
bell
ring
merrily
,
and
the
church
be
full
than
all
through
the
rest
of
the

with
red

among
the
abundant
dark

green
bough
 
face
prepare
for
a
long
service
than
usual
by
an
odorous
breakfast
of
toast
and
ale
.
 
<EOS>
those
green
bough
,
the
hymn
and
anthem
never
hear
but
at
Christmas
 
even
the
Athanasian
Creed
,
which
be
discriminate
from
the
other
only
as
be

of
exceptional
virtue

since
it
be
only

on
rare
occasion

a
vague
exulting
sense

<EOS>
for
which
the
grow

could
as
little
have
find
word
as
the
child

that
something
great

for

in
heaven
above

in

and
then
the
red

make
their
way
through
the
black
biting
frost
to
their

themselves
free

Anxiety
go

refuse

some

I

bonnet

greatcoat

cut
out
under
an
exiguity
of
cloth
that
would
only
allow
of
miniature
cape

be
not
well
adapt
to
conceal
deficiency
of
contour

be
drab

It

be
free
from
self
-
consciousness
;
but
certainly
the
bloom
on
her
cheek
be
at
its
high
point
of
contrast
with
the
surround
drab
when
she
arrive
at
the
door
of
the
Red
House
,
and
see
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
ready
to
lift
her
from
the
pillion
.
 
<EOS>
She
wish
her
sister
Priscilla
have
come
up
at
the
same
time
behind
the
servant
,
for
then
she
would
have
contrive
that
Mr.
Godfrey
should
have
lift
off
Priscilla
first
,
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
she
would
have
persuade
her
father
to
go
round
to
the
horse
-
block
instead
of
alight
at
the
door
-
step
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
painful
,
when
you
have
make
it
quite
clear
to
a
young
man
that
you
be
determine
not
to
marry
him
,
however
much
he
may
wish
it
,
that
he
would
still
continue
to
pay
you
marked
attention
;
besides
,
why
do
not
he
always
show
the
same
attention
,
if
he
mean
them
sincerely
,
instead
of
be
so
strange
as
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
be
,
sometimes
behave
as
if
he
do
not
want
to
speak
to
her
,
and
take
no
notice
of
her
for
week
and
week
,
and
then
,
all
on
a
sudden
,
almost
make
love
again
?
<EOS>
moreover
,
it
be
quite
plain
he
have
no
real
love
for
her
,
else
he
would
not
let
people
have
_
that
_
to
say
of
him
which
they
do
say
.
<EOS>
do
he
suppose
that
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
be
to
be
win
by
any
man
,
squire
or
no
squire
,
who
lead
a
bad
life
?
 
<EOS>
that
be
not
what
she
have
be
use
to
see
in
her
own
father
,
who
be
the
soberest
and
good
man
in
that
country
-
side
,
<EOS>
only
a
little
hot
and
hasty
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
thing
be
not
do
to
the
minute
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
thought
rush
through
Miss
Nancy
's
mind
,
in
their
habitual
succession
,
in
the
moment
between
her
first
sight
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
stand
at
the
door
and
her
own
arrival
there
.
<EOS>
happily
,
the
Squire
come
out
too
and
give
a
loud
greeting
to
her
father
,
so
that
,
somehow
,
under
cover
of
this
noise
she
seem
to
find
concealment
for
her
confusion
and
neglect
of
any
suitably
formal
behaviour
,
while
she
be
be
lift
from
the
pillion
by
strong
arm
which
seem
to
find
her
ridiculously
small
and
light
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
the
good
reason
for
hasten
into
the
house
at
once
,
since
the
snow
be
begin
to
fall
again
,
threaten
an
unpleasant
journey
for
such
guest
as
be
still
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
a
small
minority
;
for
already
the
afternoon
be
begin
to
decline
,
and
there
would
not
be
too
much
time
for
the
lady
who
come
from
a
distance
to
attire
themselves
in
readiness
for
the
early
tea
which
be
to
inspirit
them
for
the
dance
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
buzz
of
voice
through
the
house
,
as
Miss
Nancy
enter
,
mingle
with
the
scrape
of
a
fiddle
prelude
in
the
kitchen
;
but
the
Lammeters
be
guest
whose
arrival
have
evidently
be
think
of
so
much
that
it
have
be
watch
for
from
the
window
,
for
Mrs.
Kimble
,
who
do
the
honour
at
the
Red
House
on
these
great
occasion
,
come
forward
to
meet
Miss
Nancy
in
the
hall
,
and
conduct
her
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Kimble
be
the
Squire
's
sister
,
as
well
as
the
doctor
's
wife
 
a
double
dignity
,
with
which
her
diameter
be
in
direct
proportion
;
so
that
,
a
journey
up
-
stair
be
rather
fatigue
to
her
<EOS>
,
she
do
not
oppose
Miss
Nancy
's
request
to
be
allow
to
find
her
way
alone
to
the
Blue
Room
,
where
the
Miss
Lammeters
'
bandbox
have
be
deposit
on
their
arrival
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
hardly
a
bedroom
in
the
house
where
feminine
compliment
be
not
pass
and
feminine
toilette
go
forward
,
in
various
stage
,
in
space
make
scanty
by
extra
bed
spread
upon
the
floor
;
and
Miss
Nancy
,
as
she
enter
the
Blue
Room
,
have
to
make
her
little
formal
curtsy
to
a
group
of
six
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
one
hand
,
there
be
lady
no
less
important
than
the
two
Miss
Gunns
,
the
wine
merchant
's
daughter
from
Lytherly
,
dress
in
the
height
of
fashion
,
with
the
tight
skirt
and
the
short
waist
,
and
gaze
at
by
Miss
Ladbrook
(
of
the
Old
Pastures
)
with
a
shyness
not
unsustained
by
inward
criticism
.
 
<EOS>
Partly
,
Miss
Ladbrook
feel
that
her
own
skirt
must
be
regard
as
unduly
lax
by
the
Miss
Gunns
,
and
partly
,
that
it
be
a
pity
the
Miss
Gunns
do
not
show
that
judgment
which
she
herself
would
show
if
she
be
in
their
place
,
by
stop
a
little
on
this
side
of
the
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
Mrs.
Ladbrook
be
stand
in
skull

cap
and
front
,
with
her
turban
in
her
hand
,
curtsy
and
smile
blandly
and
say
,
"
after
you

madam
,
"
to
another
lady
in
similar
circumstance
,
who
have
politely
offer
the
precedence
at
the
looking

glass
.
  
<EOS>
but
Miss
Nancy
have
no
sooner
make
her
curtsy
than
an
elderly
lady
come
forward
,
whose
full
white
muslin
kerchief
,
and
mob
-
cap
round
her
curl
of
smooth
grey
hair
,
be
in
dare
contrast
with
the
puffed
yellow
satin
and
top
-
knot
cap
of
her
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
She
approach
Miss
Nancy
with
much
primness
,
and
say
,
with
a
slow
,
treble
suavity
    
"
Niece
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
see
you
well
in
health
.
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Nancy
kiss
her
aunt
's
cheek
dutifully
,
and
answer
,
with
the
same
sort
of
amiable
primness
,
"
quite
well
,
I
thank
you
,
aunt
;
and
I
hope
I
see
you
the
same

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you

I
keep
my
health
for
the
present

<EOS>
and
how
be
my
brother
-
in

law
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
these
dutiful
question
and
answer
be
continue
until
it
be
ascertain
in
detail
that
the
Lammeters
be
all
as
well
as
usual
,
and
the
Osgoods
likewise
,
also
that
niece
Priscilla
must
certainly
arrive
shortly
,
and
that
travel
on
pillion
in
snowy
weather
be
unpleasant
,
though
a
joseph
be
a
great
protection
.
 
<EOS>
then
Nancy
be
formally
introduce
to
her
aunt
's
visitor
,
the
Miss
Gunns
,
as
be
the
daughter
of
a
mother
know
to
_
their
_
mother
,
though
now
for
the
first
time
induce
to
make
a
journey
into
these
part
;
and
these
lady
be
so
take
by
surprise
at
find
such
a
lovely
face
and
figure
in
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
country
place
,
that
they
begin
to
feel
some
curiosity
about
the
dress
she
would
put
on
when
she
take
off
her
joseph
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Nancy
,
whose
thought
be
always
conduct
with
the
propriety
and
moderation
conspicuous
in
her
manner
,
remark
to
herself
that
the
Miss
Gunns
be
rather
hard
-
featured
than
otherwise
,
and
that
such
very
low
dress
as
they
wear
may
have
be
attribute
to
vanity
if
their
shoulder
have
be
pretty
,
but
that
,
be
as
they
be
,
it
be
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
show
their
neck
from
a
love
of
display
,
but
rather
from
some
obligation
not
inconsistent
with
sense
and
modesty
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
convinced
,
as
she
open
her
box
,
that
this
must
be
her
aunt
Osgood
's
opinion
,
for
Miss
Nancy
's
mind
resemble
her
aunt
be
to
a
degree
that
everybody
say
be
surprising
,
consider
the
kinship
be
on
Mr.
Osgood
's
side
;
and
though
you
may
not
have
suppose
it
from
the
formality
of
their
greeting
,
there
be
a
devoted
attachment
and
mutual
admiration
between
aunt
and
niece
.
 
<EOS>
even
Miss
Nancy
's
refusal
of
her
cousin
Gilbert
Osgood
(
on
the
ground
solely
that
he
be
her
cousin
)
,
though
it
have
grieve
her
aunt
greatly
,
have
not
in
the
least
cool
the
preference
which
have
determine
her
to
leave
Nancy
several
of
her
hereditary
ornament
,
let
Gilbert
's
future
wife
be
whom
she
may
.
  
<EOS>
three
of
the
lady
quickly
retire
,
but
the
Miss
Gunns
be
quite
content
that
Mrs.
Osgood
's
inclination
to
remain
with
her
niece
give
them
also
a
reason
for
stay
to
see
the
rustic
beauty
's
toilette
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
really
a
pleasure
 
from
the
first
opening
of
the
bandbox
,
where
everything
smelt
of
lavender
and
rise
-
leave
,
to
the
clasping
of
the
small
coral
necklace
that
fit
closely
round
her
little
white
neck
.
<EOS>
everything
belong
to
Miss
Nancy
be
of
delicate
purity
and
nattiness
:
not
a
crease
be
where
it
have
no
business
to
be
,
not
a
bit
of
her
linen
profess
whiteness
without
fulfil
its
profession
;
the
very
pin
on
her
pincushion
be
stick
in
after
a
pattern
from
which
she
be
careful
to
allow
no
aberration
;
and
as
for
her
own
person
,
it
give
the
same
idea
of
perfect
unvarying
neatness
as
the
body
of
a
little
bird
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
her
light
-
brown
hair
be
crop
behind
like
a
boy
's
,
and
be
dress
in
front
in
a
number
of
flat
ring
,
that
lie
quite
away
from
her
face
;
but
there
be
no
sort
of
coiffure
that
could
make
Miss
Nancy
's
cheek
and
neck
look
otherwise
than
pretty
;
and
when
at
last
she
stand
complete
in
her
silvery
twilled
silk
,
her
lace
tucker
,
her
coral
necklace
,
and
coral
ear
-
drop
,
the
Miss
Gunns
could
see
nothing
to
criticise
except
her
hand
,
which
bear
the
trace
of
butter
-
making
,
cheese
-
crushing
,
and
even
still
coarse
work
.
 
<EOS>
but
Miss
Nancy
be
not
ashamed
of
that
,
for
even
while
she
be
dress
she
narrate
to
her
aunt
<EOS>
how
she
and
Priscilla
have
pack
their
box
yesterday
,
because
this
morning
be
bake
morning
,
and
since
they
be
leave
home
,
it
be
desirable
to
make
a
good
supply
of
meat
-
pie
for
the
kitchen
;
and
as
she
conclude
this
judicious
remark
,
she
turn
to
the
Miss
Gunns
that
she
may
not
commit
the
rudeness
of
not
include
them
in
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
the
Miss
Gunns
smile
stiffly
,
and
think
what
a
pity
it
be
that
these
rich
country
people
,
who
could
afford
to
buy
such
good
clothe
(
really
Miss
Nancy
's
lace
and
silk
be
very
costly
)
,
should
be
bring
up
in
utter
ignorance
and
vulgarity
.
 
<EOS>
She
actually
say
"
mate
"
for
"
meat
"
,
"
'
appen
"
for
"
perhaps
"
,
and
"
oss
"
for
"
horse
"
,
which
,
to
young
lady
live
in
good
lytherly
society
,
who
habitually
say
'
orse
,
even
in
domestic
privacy
,
and
<EOS>
only
say
'
appen
on
the
right
occasion
,
be
necessarily
shocking
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Nancy
,
indeed
,
have
never
be
to
any
school
high
than
<EOS>
Dame
Tedman
's
:
her
acquaintance
with
profane
literature
hardly
go
beyond
the
rhyme
she
have
work
in
her
large
sampler
under
the
lamb
and
the
shepherdess
;
and
in
order
to
balance
an
account
,
she
be
oblige
to
effect
her
subtraction
by
remove
visible
metallic
shilling
and
sixpence
from
a
visible
metallic
total
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
hardly
a
servant
-
maid
in
these
day
who
be
not
better
inform
than
Miss
Nancy
;
yet
she
have
the
essential
attribute
of
a
lady
 
high
veracity
,
delicate
honour
in
her
dealing
,
deference
to
other
,
and
refine
personal
habit
,
 
and
lest
these
should
not
suffice
to
convince
grammatical
fair
one
that
her
feeling
can
at
all
resemble
theirs
,
I
will
add
that
she
be
slightly
proud
and
exacting
,
and
as
constant
in
her
affection
towards
a
baseless
opinion
as
towards
an
err
lover
.
  
<EOS>
the
anxiety
about
sister
Priscilla
,
which
have
grow
rather
active
by
the
time
the
coral
necklace
be
clasp
,
be
happily
end
by
the
entrance
of
that
cheerful
-
look
lady
herself
,
with
a
face
make
blowsy
by
cold
and
damp
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
first
question
and
greeting
,
she
turn
to
Nancy
,
and
survey
her
from
head
to
foot
 
then
wheel
her
round
,
to
ascertain
that
the
back
view
be
equally
faultless
.
  
<EOS>
"
what

Mrs.

any

do

the

natured

common

sense
of

would
soon
have
dissipate
the
one
suspicion

the
modest

speech

tell
clearly
of

place

pleasant
with
handsome
branch
of
holly
,
yew
,
and
laurel
,
from
the
abundant
growth
of
the
old
garden

and
Nancy
feel
an
inward
flutter

that
no
firmness

purpose
could
prevent
,
when
she
see
Mr.

advance
to

<EOS>
It
certainly
do
make
some
difference
to
Nancy
that
the
lover
she
have
give
up
be
the
young
man
of
quite
the
high
consequence
in

be
speak

these
circumstance
exalt
her
inward

deepen
the
emphasis
with
which
she
declare
to
herself
that
not
the
most
dazzling
rank
should
induce
her
to
marry
a
man
whose
conduct
show
him
careless
of

that

"
love
once

love
always

be
the
motto
of
a
true

pure

no

should
ever
have
any

would
be

nothing

a

blush
betray
the
move
thought
that
urge
themselves
upon
her
as
she
accept
the

she
be
so
instinctively
neat

adroit
in

her
action

her
pretty
lip
meet

with
such
quiet

appropriate
compliment

<EOS>
He
be
not
in
the
least
lofty

aristocratic

simply
a
merry

eyed

small

featured

grey
-
haired
man
,
with
his
chin
prop
by
an
ample
,
many
-
creased
white
neckcloth
which
seem
to
predominate
over
every
other
point
in
his
person

somehow
to
impress
its
peculiar
character
on
his
remark
;
<EOS>
so
that
to
have
consider
his
amenity
apart
from
his
cravat
would
have
be
a
severe
,
and
perhaps
a
dangerous
,
effort
of
abstraction
.
  
<EOS>
"
ha
,
Miss
Nancy

"
he
say
,
turn
his
head
within

smile
down
pleasantly
upon

Godfrey
make
no

avoid

very
markedly

these
complimentary
personality
be
hold
to
be
in

fashioned

reverent
love
have
a
politeness
of
its
own
which
it
teach
to
man
otherwise
of
small
schooling

<EOS>
but
the
Squire
be
rather
impatient
at
<EOS>
Godfrey

show
himself
a
dull
spark
in
this
way

<EOS>
by
this
advanced
hour
of
the
day
,
the
Squire
be
always
in
high
spirit
than
we
have
see
him
in
at
the
breakfast
-
table
,
and
feel
it
quite
pleasant
to
fulfil
the
hereditary
duty
of
be
noisily
jovial
and
patronizing
:
the
large
silver
snuff
-
box
be
in
active
service
and
be
offer
without
fail
to
all
neighbour
from
time
to
time
,
however
often
they
may
have
decline
the
favour
.
 
<EOS>
at
present
,
the
Squire
have
only
give
an
express
welcome
to
the
head
of
family
as
they
appear
;
but
always
as
the
evening
deepen
,
his
hospitality
ray
out
more
widely
,
till
he
have
tap
the
young
guest
on
the
back
and
show
a
peculiar
fondness
for
their
presence
,
in
the
full
belief
that
they
must
feel
their
life
make
happy
by
their
belong
to
a
parish
where
there
be
such
a
hearty
man
as
Squire
Cass
to
invite
them
and
wish
them
well
.
 
<EOS>
even
in
this
early
stage
of
the
jovial
mood
,
it
be
natural
that
he
should
wish
to
supply
his
son
's
deficiency
by
look
and
speak
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
aye

he
begin
,
offer
his
snuff

box
to
Mr.

who
for
the
second
time
bow
his
head
and
wave
his
hand
in
stiff
rejection
of
the
offer

emphatic
compliment

feel
by
other
besides

to
have
a
diplomatic
significance

give
a
slight
additional
erectness

the
stout

Doctor
Kimble
(
country

<EOS>
Time
out
of
mind
<EOS>
the
Raveloe
doctor
have
be
a
Kimble
;
Kimble
be
inherently
a
doctor
's
name
;
and
it
be
difficult
to
contemplate
firmly
the
melancholy
fact
that
the
actual
Kimble
have
no
son
,
so
that
his
practice
may
one
day
be
hand
over
to
a
successor
with
the
incongruous
name

Taylor

Johnson

in
that
case
the
wise
people

Dr.

foresee

play
vigorously

march
forward
at

the
White

where

Old

already

great
be
the
admiration

satisfaction
in
that
quarter
when
the

have
form
themselves
for
the
dance

and
the
Squire
lead
off
with
Mrs.

that
be

that

what
everybody
have
be
use

and
<EOS>
the
charter
of
Raveloe
seem
to
be
renew
by
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
think
of
as
an
unbecoming
levity
for
the
old
and
middle
-
aged
people
to
dance
a
little
before
sit
down
to
card
,
but
rather
as
part
of
their
social
duty

<EOS>
for
what
be
these
if
not
to
be
merry
at
appropriate
time
,
interchanging
visit

poultry
with
due
frequency

pay
each

old

establish
compliment

pass
well

try
personal

urge
your

to
eat

out

hospitality

eat

drink
too
much
in
your
neighbour

house
to
show
that
you
like
your
cheer

<EOS>
and
the
parson
naturally
set
an
example
in
these
social
duty
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
would
not
have
be
possible
for
the
Raveloe
mind
,
without
a
peculiar
revelation
,
to
know
that
a
clergyman
should
be
a
pale
-
faced
memento
of
solemnity
,
instead
of
a
reasonably
faulty
man
whose
exclusive
authority
to
read
prayer
and
preach
,
to
christen
,
marry
,
and
bury
you
,
necessarily
coexist
with
the
right
to
sell
you
the
ground
to
be
bury
in
and
to
take
tithe
in
kind
;
on
which
last
point
,
of
course
,
there
be
a
little
grumbling
,
but
not
to
the
extent
of
irreligion
 
not
of
deep
significance
than
the
grumbling
at
the
rain
,
which
be
by
no
mean
accompany
with
a
spirit
of
impious
defiance
,
but
with
a
desire
that
the
prayer
for
fine
weather
may
be
read
forthwith
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
,
then
,
why
the
rector

dancing
should
not
be
receive
as
part
of
the
fitness
of
thing
quite
as
much
as
the
Squire

,
or
why
,
on
the
other
hand
,
Mr.
Macey
's
official
respect
should
restrain
him
from
subject
the
parson
's
performance
to
that
criticism
with
which
mind
of
extraordinary
acuteness
must
necessarily
contemplate
the
doing
of
their
fallible
fellow

<EOS>
"
the

Mr.

uncommon
well

Mr.

beat
'em
all

you

he

cushiony

<EOS>
they
run
fat
in
general

he
be
get
a
fine

<EOS>
the

nimble
enough

he
have
not

much
of

it
be

as
anybody

pritty

<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if

Madam
Cass
<EOS>
some
day
,
arter
<EOS>
all
 
and
nobody
more
rightfuller
,
for
they
would
make
a
fine
match
.
<EOS>
You
can
find
nothing
against
Master
Godfrey
's
shape
,
Macey
,
<EOS>
_
i_'ll
bet
a
penny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Macey
screw
up
his
mouth
,
lean
his
head
further
on
one
side
,
and
twirl
his
thumb
with
a
presto
movement
as
his
eye
follow
Godfrey
up
the
dance
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
sum
up
his
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
"
pretty
well
down'ard
,
but
a
bit
too
round
<EOS>
i
'
the
shoulder
-
blade
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
them
coat
as
he
get
from
the
Flitton
tailor
,
they
be
a
poor
cut
to
pay
double
money
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Mr.
Macey
,
you
and
me
be
two
folk
,
"
say
Ben
,
slightly
indignant
at
this
carping
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
I
have
get
a
pot
o
'
good
ale
,
I
like
to
swaller
it
,
and
do
my
inside
good
,
i'stead
o
'
smelling
and
stare
at
it
to
see
if
I
can
not
find
faut
wi
'
the
brewing
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
you
to
pick
me
out
a
finer
-
limbe
young
fellow
nor
Master
Godfrey
 
one
as

or

more
pleasanter

looksed
when

be
piert
and
merry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
tchuh
!
"
 
<EOS>
say
Mr.
Macey
,
provoke
to
increase
severity
,
"
he
be
not
come
to
his
right
colour
yet
:
<EOS>
he
be
partly
like
a
slack
-
bake
pie
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
doubt
he
be
get
a
soft
place
in
his
head
,
else
why
should
he
be
turn
round
the
finger
by
that
offal
Dunsey
as
nobody
be
see
o
'
late
,
and
let
him
kill
that
fine
hunting
hoss
as
be
the
talk
o
'
the
country
?
 
<EOS>
and
one
while
he
be
allay
after
Miss
Nancy
,
<EOS>
and
then
it
all
go
off
again
,
like
a
smell
<EOS>
o
'
hot
porridge
,
as
I
may
say
.
<EOS>
that
be
not
my
way
when
_
I
_
go
a
-
coorting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
but
mayhap
Miss
Nancy
hang
off
,
like
,
and
your
lass
do
not
,
"
say
Ben
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
she
do
not
,
"
say
Mr.
Macey
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"
before
I
say
"
sniff
"
,
I
take
care
to
know
as
she
would
say
"
snaff
"
,
and
pretty
quick
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
-
go
to
open
_
<EOS>
my
_
mouth
,
like
a
dog
at
a
fly
,
and
snap
it
to
again
,
wi
'
nothing
to
swaller
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
think
Miss
Nancy
's
a
-
come
round
again
,
"
say
Ben
,
"
for
Master
Godfrey
do
not
look
so
down
-
hearted
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
see
he
be
for
take
her
away
to
sit
down
<EOS>
,
now
they
be
at
the
end
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
the
dance
:
<EOS>
that
look
like
sweethearting
,
that
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
reason
why
Godfrey
and
Nancy
have
leave
the
dance
be
not
so
tender
as
Ben
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
close
press
of
couple
a
slight
accident
have
happen
to
Nancy
's
dress
,
which
,
while
it
be
short
enough
to
show
her
neat
ankle
in
front
,
be
long
enough
behind
to
be
catch
under
the
stately
stamp
of
the
Squire
's
foot
,
so
as
to
rend
certain
stitch
at
the
waist
,
and
cause
much
sisterly
agitation
in
Priscilla
's
mind
,
as
well
as
serious
concern
in
Nancy
's
.
 
<EOS>
one
's
thought
may
be
much
occupy
with
love
-
struggle
,
but
hardly
so
as
to
be
insensible
to
a
disorder
in
the
general
framework
of
thing
.
<EOS>
Nancy
have
no
sooner
complete
her
duty
in
the
figure
they
be
dance
than
she
say
to
Godfrey
,
with
a
deep
blush
,
that
she
must
go
and
sit
down
till
Priscilla
could
come
to
her
;
for
the
sister
have
already
exchange
a
short
whisper
and
an
open
-
eyed
glance
full
of
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
no
reason
less
urgent
than
this
could
have
prevail
on
Nancy
to
give
Godfrey
this
opportunity
of
sit
apart
with
her
.
<EOS>
as
for
Godfrey
,
he
be
feel
so
happy
and
oblivious
under
the
long
charm
of
the
country
-
dance
with
Nancy
,
that
he
get
rather
bold
on
the
strength
of
her
confusion
,
and
be
capable
of
lead
her
straight
away
,
without
leave
ask
,
into
the
adjoin
small
parlour
,
where
the
card
-
table
be
set
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
thank
you
,
"
say
Nancy
,
coldly
,
as
soon
as
she
perceive
where
he
be
go
,
"
not
in
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
wait
here
till
Priscilla
's
ready
to
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
bring
you
out
of
the
dance
and
make
myself
troublesome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
will
be
more
comfortable
here
by
yourself
,
"
say
the
artful
Godfrey
:
"
I
will
leave
you
here
till
your
sister
can
come
.
"
<EOS>
He
speak
in
an
indifferent
tone
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
an
agreeable
proposition
,
and
just
what
Nancy
desire
;
why
,
then
,
be
she
a
little
hurt
that
Mr.
Godfrey
should
make
it
?
 
<EOS>
They
enter
,
and
she
seat
herself
on
a
chair
against
one
of
the
card
-
table
,
as
the
stiff
and
most
unapproachable
position
she
could
choose
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
she
say
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
give
you
any
more
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
you
have
have
such
an
unlucky
partner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
ill
-
natured
of
you
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
stand
by
her
without
any
sign
of
intend
departure
,
"
to
be
sorry
you
have
dance
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
sir
,
I
do
not
mean
to
say
what
be
ill
-
natured
at
all
,
"
say
Nancy
,
look
distractingly
prim
and
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
gentleman
have
so
many
pleasure
,
one
dance
can
matter
but
very
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
be
not
true
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
one
dance
with
you
matter
more
to
me
than
all
the
other
pleasure
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
,
long
while
since
Godfrey
have
say
anything
so
direct
as
that
,
and
Nancy
be
startle
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
instinctive
dignity
and
repugnance
to
any
show
of
emotion
make
her
sit
perfectly
still
,
and
only
throw
a
little
more
decision
into
her
voice
,
as
she
say
    
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Godfrey
,
that
be
not
known
to
me
,
and
I
have
very
good
reason
for
think
different
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
true
,
I
do
not
wish
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
never
forgive
me
,
then
,
Nancy
 
never
think
well
of
me
,
let
what
would
happen
 
<EOS>
would
you
never
think
the
present
make
amend
for
the
past
?
 
<EOS>
not
if
I
turn
a
good
fellow
,
and
give
up
everything
you
do
not
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
be
half
conscious
that
this
sudden
opportunity
of
speak
to
Nancy
alone
have
drive
him
beside
himself
;
but
blind
feeling
have
get
the
mastery
of
his
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
really
feel
much
agitate
by
the
possibility
Godfrey
's
word
suggest
,
but
this
very
pressure
of
emotion
that
she
be
in
danger
of
find
too
strong
for
her
rouse
all
her
power
of
self
-
command
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
glad
to
see
a
good
change
in
anybody
,
Mr.
Godfrey
,
"
she
answer
,
with
the
slight
discernible
difference
of
tone
,
"
but
it
'
ud
be
well
if
no
change
be
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
hard
-
hearted
,
Nancy
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
pettishly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
encourage
me
to
be
a
well
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
miserable
 
<EOS>
but
you
have
no
feeling

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
those
have
the
least
feeling
that
act
wrong
to
begin
with

"
say
Nancy
,
send
out
a
flash
in
spite
of
herself
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
be
delight
with
that
little
flash
,
and
would
have
like
to
go
on
and
make
her
quarrel
with
him
;
Nancy
be
so
exasperatingly
quiet
and
firm
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
indifferent
to
him
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
yet
_
,
though
    
the
entrance
of
Priscilla
,
bustle
forward
and
say
,
"
dear
heart
alive
,
child
,
let
us
look
at
this
gown
,
"
cut
off
Godfrey
's
hope
of
a
quarrel
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
must
go
now
,
"
he
say
to
Priscilla
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
matter
to
me
whether
you
go
or
stay
,
"
say
that
frank
lady
,
search
for
something
in
her
pocket
,
with
a
preoccupied
brow
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
_
you
_
want
me
to
go
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
Godfrey
,
look
at
Nancy
,
who
be
now
stand
up
by
Priscilla
's
order
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
you
like
,
"
say
Nancy
,
try
to
recover
all
her
former
coldness
,
and
look
down
carefully
at
the
hem
of
her
gown
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
like
to
stay
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
with
a
reckless
determination
to
get
as
much
of
this
joy
as
he
could
to
-
night
,
and
think
nothing
of
the
morrow
.
    
<EOS>
while
Godfrey
Cass
be
take
draught
of
forgetfulness
from
the
sweet
presence
of
Nancy
,
willingly
lose
all
sense
of
that
hide
bond
which
at
other
moment
gall
and
fret

wife

with
slow
uncertain
step
through
the
snow
-
cover
Raveloe
lane
,
carry
her
child
in
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
this
journey
on
New
Year
's
Eve
be
a
premeditated
act
of
vengeance
which
she
have
keep
in
her
heart
ever
since
Godfrey
,
in
a
fit
of
passion
,
have
tell
her
he
would
sooner
die
than
acknowledge
her
as
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
there
would
be
a
great
party
at
the
Red
House
on
New
Year
's
Eve
,
she
know
:
her
husband
would
be
smile
and
smile
upon
,
hide
_
<EOS>
her
_
existence
in
the
dark
corner
of
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
would
mar
his
pleasure
:
she
would
go
in
her
dingy
rag
,
with
her
faded
face
,
once
as
handsome
as
the
good
,
with
her
little
child
that
have
its
father
's
hair
and
eye
,
and
disclose
herself
to
the
Squire
as
his
eld
son
's
wife
.
<EOS>
It
be
seldom
that
the
miserable
can
help
regard
their
misery
as
a
wrong
inflict
by
those
who
be
less
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
Molly
know
that
the
cause
of
her
dingy
rag
be
not
her
husband
's
neglect
,
but
the
demon
Opium
to
whom
she
be
enslave
,
body
and
soul
,
except
in
the
linger
mother
's
tenderness
that
refuse
to
give
him
her
hungry
child
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
this
well
;
and
yet
,
in
the
moment
of
wretched
unbenumbed
consciousness
,
the
sense
of
her
want
and
degradation
transform
itself
continually
into
bitterness
towards
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
be
well
off
;
and
if
she
have
her
right
she
would
be
well
off
too
.
 
<EOS>
the
belief
that
he
repent
his
marriage
,
and
suffer
from
it
,
only
aggravate
her
vindictiveness
.
<EOS>
just
and
self
-
reprove
thought
do
not
come
to
us
too
thickly
,
even
in
the
pure
air
,
and
with
the
good
lesson
of
heaven
and
earth
;
how
should
those
white
-
winged
delicate
messenger
make
their
way
to
Molly
's
poison
chamber
,
inhabit
by
no
high
memory
than
those
of
a
barmaid
's
paradise
of
pink
ribbon
and
gentleman
's
joke
?
  
<EOS>
She
have
set
out
at
an
early
hour
,
but
have
linger
on
the
road
,
incline
by
her
indolence
to
believe
that
if
she
wait
under
a
warm
shed
the
snow
would
cease
to
fall
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
wait
longer
than
she
know
,
and
now
that
she
find
herself
belate
in
the
snow
-
hide
ruggedness
of
the
long
lane
,
even
the
animation
of
a
vindictive
purpose
could
not
keep
her
spirit
from
fail
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
seven
o'clock
,
and
by
this
time
she
be
not
very
far
from
Raveloe
,
but
she
be
not
familiar
enough
with
those
monotonous
lane
to
know
how
near
she
be
to
her
journey
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
She
need
comfort
,
and
she
know
<EOS>
but
one
comforter
 
<EOS>
the
familiar
demon
in
her
bosom
<EOS>
;
but
she
hesitate
a
moment
,
after
draw
out
the
black
remnant
,
before
she
raise
it
to
her
lip
.
<EOS>
in
that
moment
the
mother
's
love
plead
for
painful
consciousness
rather
than
oblivion
 
plead
to
be
leave
in
ache
weariness
,
rather
than
to
have
the
encircle
arm
benumb
so
that
they
could
not
feel
the
dear
burden
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
moment
Molly
have
fling
something
away
,
but
it
be
not
the
black
remnant
 
<EOS>
it
be
an
empty
phial
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
walk
on
again
under
the
break
cloud
,
from
which
there
come
now
<EOS>
and
then
the
light
of
a
quickly
veil
star
,
for
a
freezing
wind
have
spring
up
since
the
snowing
have
cease
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
walk
always
more
and
more
drowsily
,
and
clutch
more
and
more
automatically
the
sleep
child
at
her
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
slowly
the
demon
be
work
his
will
,
and
cold
and
weariness
be
his
helper
.
 
<EOS>
soon
she
feel
nothing
but
a
supreme
immediate
longing
that
curtain
off
all
futurity
 
the
longing
to
lie
down
and
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
arrive
at
a
spot
where
her
footstep
be
no
longer
check
by
a
hedgerow
,
and
she
have
wander
vaguely
,
unable
to
distinguish
any
object
,
notwithstanding
the
wide
whiteness
around
her
,
and
the
grow
starlight
.
 
<EOS>
She
sink
down
against
a
straggle
furze
bush
,
an
easy
pillow
enough
;
and
the
bed
of
snow
,
too
,
be
soft
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
feel
that
the
bed
be
cold
,
and
do
not
heed
whether
the
child
would
wake
and
cry
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
arm
have
not
yet
relax
their
instinctive
clutch
;
and
the
little
one
slumber
on
as
gently
as
if
it
have
be
rock
in
a
lace
-
trim
cradle
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
complete
torpor
come
at
last
<EOS>
:
the
finger
lose
their
tension
,
the
arm
unbend
;
then
the
little
head
fall
away
from
the
bosom
,
and
the
blue
eye
open
wide
on
the
cold
starlight
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
there
be
a
little
peevish
cry
of
"
mammy
"
,
and
an
effort
to
regain
the
pillow
arm
and
bosom
;
but
mammy
's
ear
be
deaf
,
and
the
pillow
seem
to
be
slip
away
backward
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
as
the
child
roll
downward
on
its
mother
's
knee
,
all
wet
with
snow
,
its
eye
be
catch
by
a
bright
glancing
light
on
the
white
ground
,
and
,
with
the
ready
transition
of
infancy
,
it
be
immediately
absorb
in
watch
the
bright
living
thing
run
towards
it
,
yet
never
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
that
bright
living
thing
must
be
catch
;
and
in
an
instant
the
child
have
slip
on
all
-
four
,
and
hold
out
one
little
hand
to
catch
the
gleam
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
gleam
would
not
be
catch
in
that
way
,
and
now
the
head
be
hold
up
to
see
where
the
cunning
gleam
come
from
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
from
a
very
bright
place
;
and
the
little
one
,
rise
on
its
leg
,
toddle
through
the
snow
,
the
old
grimy
shawl
in
which
it
be
wrap
trail
behind
it
,
and
the
queer
little
bonnet
dangle
at
its
back
 
toddle
on
to
the
open
door
of
Silas
Marner
's
cottage
,
and
right
up
to
the
warm
hearth
,
where
there
be
a
bright
fire
of
log
and
stick
,
which
have
thoroughly
warm
the
old
sack
(
Silas
's
greatcoat
)
spread
out
on
the
brick
to
dry
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
one
,
accustom
to
be
leave
to
itself
for
long
hour
without
notice
from
its
mother
,
squat
down
on
the
sack
,
and
spread
its
tiny
hand
towards
the
blaze
,
in
perfect
contentment
,
gurgle
and
make
many
inarticulate
communication
to
the
cheerful
fire
,
like
a
new
-
hatched
gosling
begin
to
find
itself
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
but
presently
the
warmth
have
a
lulling
effect
,
and
the
little
golden
head
sink
down
on
the
old
sack
,
and
the
blue
eye
be
veil
by
their
delicate
half
-
transparent
lid
.
  
<EOS>
but
where
be
Silas
Marner
while
this
strange
visitor
have
come
to
his
hearth
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
cottage
,
but
he
do
not
see
the
child
.
<EOS>
during
the
last
few
week
,
since
he
have
lose
his
money
,
he
have
contract
the
habit
of
open
his
door
and
look
out
from
time
to
time
,
as
if
he
think
that
his
money
may
be
somehow
come
back
to
him
,
or
that
some
trace
,
some
news
of
it
,
may
be
mysteriously
on
the
road
,
and
be
catch
by
the
listening
ear
or
the
strain
eye
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
chiefly
at
night
,
when
he
be
not
occupy
in
his
loom
,
that
he
fall
into
this
repetition
of
an
act
for
which
he
could
have
assign
no
definite
purpose
,
and
which
can
hardly
be
understand
except
by
those
who
have
undergo
a
bewilder
separation
from
a
supremely
love
object
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
evening
twilight
,
and
later
whenever
the
night
be
not
dark
,
Silas
look
out
on
that
narrow
prospect
round
the
Stone
-
pit
,
listening
and
gaze
,
not
with
hope
,
but
with
mere
yearning
and
unrest
.
  
<EOS>
this
morning
he
have
be
tell
by
some
of
his
neighbour
that
it
be
New
Year
's
Eve
,
and
that
he
must
sit
up
and
hear
the
old
year
ring
out
and
the
new
rung
in
,
because
that
be
good
luck
,
and
may
bring
his
money
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
only
a
friendly
Raveloe
-
way
of
jest
with
the
half
-
crazy
oddity
of
a
miser
,
but
it
have
perhaps
help
to
throw
Silas
into
a
more
than
usually
excite
state
.
 
<EOS>
since
the
on
-
coming
of
twilight
he
have
open
his
door
again
and
again
,
though
only
to
shut
it
immediately
at
see
all
distance
veil
by
the
fall
snow
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
last
time
he
open
it
the
snow
have
cease
,
and
the
cloud
be
part
here
and
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
and
listen
,
and
gaze
for
a
long
while
 
there
be
really
something
on
the
road
come
towards
him
then
,
but
he
catch
no
sign
of
it
;
and
the
stillness
and
the
wide
trackless
snow
seem
to
narrow
his
solitude
,
and
touch
his
yearning
with
the
chill
of
despair
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
in
again
,
and
put
his
right
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
door
to
close
it
 
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
close
it
<EOS>
:
he
be
arrest
,
as
he
have
be
already
since
his
loss
,
by
the
invisible
wand
of
catalepsy
,
and
stand
like
a
graven
image
,
with
wide
but
sightless
eye
,
hold
open
his
door
,
powerless
to
resist
either
the
good
or
the
evil
that
may
enter
there
.
  
<EOS>
when
Marner
's
sensibility
return
,
he
continue
the
action
which
have
be
arrest
,
and
close
his
door
,
unaware
of
the
chasm
in
his
consciousness
,
unaware
of
any
intermediate
change
,
except
that
the
light
have
grow
dim
,
and
that
he
be
chill
and
faint
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
he
have
be
too
long
stand
at
the
door
and
look
out
.
 
<EOS>
turn
towards
the
hearth
,
where
the
two
log
have
fall
apart
,
and
send
forth
only
a
red
uncertain
glimmer
,
he
seat
himself
on
his
fireside
chair
,
and
be
stoop
to
push
his
log
together
,
when
,
to
his
blurred
vision
,
it
seem
as
if
there
be
gold
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
gold
!
 
<EOS>
his
own
gold
 
bring
back
to
him
as
mysteriously
as
it
have
be
take
away
!
 
<EOS>
He
feel
his
heart
begin
to
beat
violently
,
and
for
a
few
moment
he
be
unable
to
stretch
out
his
hand
and
grasp
the
restore
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
the
heap
of
gold
seem
to
glow
and
get
large
beneath
his
agitated
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
He
lean
forward
at
last
,
and
stretch
forth
his
hand
;
but
instead
of
the
hard
coin
with
the
familiar
resist
outline
,
his
finger
encounter
soft
warm
curl
.
 
<EOS>
in
utter
amazement
,
Silas
fall
on
his
knee
and
bend
his
head
low
to
examine
the
marvel
:
it
be
a
sleep
child
 
a
round
,
fair
thing
,
with
soft
yellow
ring
all
over
its
head
.
 
<EOS>
Could
this
be
his
little
sister
<EOS>
come
back
to
him
in
a
dream
 
his
little
sister
whom
he
have
carry
about
in
his
arm
for
a
year
before
she
die
,
when
he
be
a
small
boy
without
shoe
or
stocking
?
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
first
thought
that
dart
across
Silas
's
blank
wonderment
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
be
_
it
a
dream
?
 
<EOS>
He
rise
to
his
foot
again
,
push
his
log
together
,
and
,
throw
on
some
dry
leave
and
stick
,
raise
a
flame
;
but
the
flame
do
not
disperse
the
vision
 
<EOS>
it
only
light
up
more
distinctly
the
little
round
form
of
the
child
,
and
its
shabby
clothing
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
much
like
his
little
sister
.
<EOS>
Silas
sink
into
his
chair
powerless
,
under
the
double
presence
of
an
inexplicable
surprise
and
a
hurry
influx
of
memory
.
 
<EOS>
how
and
when
have
the
child
come
in
without
his
knowledge
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
be
beyond
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
but
along
with
that
question
,
and
almost
thrust
it
away
,
there
be
a
vision
of
the
old
home
and
the
old
street
lead
to
Lantern
Yard
 
and
within
that
vision
another
,
of
the
thought
which
have
be
present
with
him
in
those
far
-
off
scene
.
<EOS>
the
thought
be
strange
to
him
now
,
like
old
friendship
impossible
to
revive
;
and
yet
he
have
a
dreamy
feeling
that
this
child
be
somehow
a
message
come
to
him
from
that
far
-
off
life
<EOS>
:
it
stir
fibre
that
have
never
be
move
in
Raveloe
 
old
quivering
of
tenderness
 
old
impression
of
awe
at
the
presentiment
of
some
Power
preside
over
his
life
;
for
his
imagination
have
not
yet
extricate
itself
from
the
sense
of
mystery
in
the
child
's
sudden
presence
,
and
have
form
no
conjecture
of
ordinary
natural
mean
by
which
the
event
could
have
be
bring
about
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
cry
on
the
hearth
<EOS>
:
the
child
have
awake
,
and
Marner
stoop
to
lift
it
on
his
knee
.
 
<EOS>
It
cling
round
his
neck
,
and
burst
louder
and
louder
into
that
mingling
of
inarticulate
cry
with
"
mammy
"
by
which
little
child
express
the
bewilderment
of
wake
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
press
it
to
him
,
and
almost
unconsciously
uttered
sound
of
hush
tenderness
,
while
he
bethink
himself
that
some
of
his
porridge
,
which
have
get
cool
by
the
die
fire
,
would
do
to
feed
the
child
with
if
it
be
only
warm
up
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
plenty
to
do
through
the
next
hour
.
 
<EOS>
the
porridge
,
sweeten
with
some
dry
brown
sugar
from
an
old
store
which
he
have
refrain
from
use
for
himself
,
stop
the
cry
of
the
little
one
,
and
make
her
lift
her
blue
eye
with
a
wide
quiet
gaze
at
Silas
,
as
he
put
the
spoon
into
her
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
presently
she
slip
from
his
knee
and
begin
to
toddle
about
,
but
with
a
pretty
stagger
that
make
Silas
jump
up
and
follow
her
lest
she
should
fall
against
anything
that
would
hurt
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
only
fall
in
a
sit
posture
on
the
ground
,
and
begin
to
pull
at
her
boot
,
look
up
at
him
with
a
crying
face
as
if
the
boot
hurt
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
her
on
his
knee
again
,
but
it
be
some
time
before
it
occur
to
Silas
's
dull
bachelor
mind
that
the
wet
boot
be
the
grievance
,
press
on
her
warm
ankle
.
 
<EOS>
He
get
them
off
with
difficulty
,
and
baby
be
at
once
happily
occupy
with
the
primary
mystery
of
her
own
toe
,
invite
Silas
,
with
much
chuckling
,
to
consider
the
mystery
too
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
wet
boot
have
at
last
suggest
to
Silas
that
the
child
have
be
walk
on
the
snow
,
and
this
rouse
him
from
his
entire
oblivion
of
any
ordinary
mean
by
which
it
could
have
enter
or
be
bring
into
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
under
the
prompting
of
this
new
idea
,
and
without
wait
to
form
conjecture
,
he
raise
the
child
in
his
arm
,
and
go
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
open
it
,
there
be
the
cry
of
"
mammy
"
again
,
which
Silas
have
not
hear
since
the
child
's
first
hungry
waking
.
 
<EOS>
bend
forward
,
he
could
just
discern
the
mark
make
by
the
little
foot
on
the
virgin
snow
,
and
he
follow
their
track
to
the
furze
bush
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mammy
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
little
one
cry
again
and
again
,
stretch
itself
forward
so
as
almost
to
escape
from
Silas
's
arm
,
before
he
himself
be
aware
that
there
be
something
more
than
the
bush
before
him
 
that
there
be
a
human
body
,
with
the
head
sink
low
in
the
furze
,
and
half
-
cover
with
the
shaken
snow
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
after
the
early
supper
-
time
at
the
Red
House
,
and
the
entertainment
be
in
that
stage
when
bashfulness
itself
have
pass
into
easy
jollity
,
when
gentleman
,
conscious
of
unusual
accomplishment
,
could
at
length
be
prevail
on
to
dance
a
hornpipe
,
and
when
the
Squire
prefer
talk
loudly
,
scatter
snuff
,
and
pat
his
visitor
'
back
,
to
sit
longer
at
the
whist
-
table
 
a
choice
exasperate
to
uncle
Kimble
,
who
,
be
always
volatile
in
sober
business
hour
,
become
intense
and
bitter
over
card
and
brandy
,
shuffle
before
his
adversary
's
deal
with
a
glare
of
suspicion
,
and
turn
up
a
mean
trump
-
card
with
an
air
of
inexpressible
disgust
,
as
if
in
a
world
where
such
thing
could
happen
one
may
as
well
enter
on
a
course
of
reckless
profligacy
.
<EOS>
when
the
evening
have
advance
to
this
pitch
of
freedom
and
enjoyment
,
it
be
usual
for
the
servant
,
the
heavy
duty
of
supper
be
well
over
,
to
get
their
share
of
amusement
by
come
to
look
on
at
the
dancing
;
so
that
the
back
region
of
the
house
be
leave
in
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
door
by
which
the
White
Parlour
be
enter
from
the
hall
,
and
they
be
both
stand
open
for
the
sake
of
air
;
but
the
low
one
be
crowd
with
the
servant
and
villager
,
and
only
the
upper
doorway
be
leave
free
.
 
<EOS>
Bob
Cass
be
figure
in
a
hornpipe
,
and
his
father
,
very
proud
of
this
lithe
son
,
whom
he
repeatedly
declare
to
be
just
like
himself
in
his
young
day
in
a
tone
that
imply
this
to
be
the
very
high
stamp
of
juvenile
merit
,
be
the
centre
of
a
group
who
have
place
themselves
opposite
the
performer
,
not
far
from
the
upper
door
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
be
stand
a
little
way
off
,
not
to
admire
his
brother
's
dancing
,
but
to
keep
sight
of
Nancy
,
who
be
seat
in
the
group
,
near
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
aloof
,
because
he
wish
to
avoid
suggest
himself
as
a
subject
for
the
Squire
's
fatherly
joke
in
connection
with
matrimony
and
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
's
beauty
,
which
be
likely
to
become
more
and
more
explicit
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
the
prospect
of
dance
with
her
again
when
the
hornpipe
be
conclude
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
it
be
very
pleasant
to
get
long
glance
at
her
quite
unobserved
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
Godfrey
be
lift
his
eye
from
one
of
those
long
glance
,
they
encounter
an
object
as
startling
to
him
at
that
moment
as
if
it
have
be
an
apparition
from
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
It
<EOS>
_
be
_
an
apparition
from
that
hidden
life
which
lie
,
like
a
dark
by
-
street
,
behind
the
goodly
ornament
facade
that
meet
the
sunlight
and
the
gaze
of
respectable
admirer
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
own
child
,
carry
in
Silas
Marner
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
his
instantaneous
impression
,
unaccompanied
by
doubt
,
though
he
have
not
see
the
child
for
month
past
;
and
when
the
hope
be
rise
that
he
may
possibly
be
mistake
,
Mr.
Crackenthorp
and
Mr.
Lammeter
have
already
advance
to
Silas
,
in
astonishment
at
this
strange
advent
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
join
them
immediately
,
unable
to
rest
without
hear
every
word
 
try
to
control
himself
,
but
conscious
that
if
any
one
notice
him
,
they
must
see
that
he
be
white
-
lipped
and
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
all
eye
at
that
end
of
the
room
be
bent
on
Silas
Marner
;
the
Squire
himself
have
rise
,
and
ask
angrily
,
"
how
be
this
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
this
?
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
do
come
in
here
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
for
the
doctor
 
<EOS>
I
want
the
doctor
,
"
Silas
have
say
,
in
the
first
moment
,
to
Mr.
Crackenthorp
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
be
the
matter
,
Marner
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
the
rector
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
doctor
be
here
;
but
say
quietly
what
you
want
him
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
woman
,
"
say
Silas
,
speak
low
,
and
half
-
breathlessly
,
just
as
Godfrey
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
dead
,
I
think
 
dead
in
the
snow
at
the
Stone
-
pit
 
not
far
from
my
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
feel
a
great
throb
:
there
be
one
terror
in
his
mind
at
that
moment
:
<EOS>
it
be
,
that
the
woman
may
_
not
_
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
an
evil
terror
 
<EOS>
an
ugly
inmate
to
have
find
a
nestling
-
place
in
Godfrey
's
kindly
disposition
;
but
no
disposition
be
a
security
from
evil
wish
to
a
man
whose
happiness
hang
on
duplicity
.
  
<EOS>
"
hush
,
hush
!
"
 
<EOS>
say
Mr.
Crackenthorp
.
 
<EOS>
"
go
out
into
the
hall
there
.
<EOS>
I
will
fetch
the
doctor
to
you

a
woman
in
the
snow
 
and
think
she
be
dead

he
add
,
speak
low
to
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
"
better
say
as
little
about
it
as
possible
:
it
will
shock
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
just
tell
them
a
poor
woman
be
ill
from
cold
and
hunger
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
fetch
Kimble

"
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
however
,
the
lady
have
press
forward
,
curious
to
know
what
could
have
bring
the
solitary
linen

weaver
there
under
such
strange
circumstance
,
and
interested
in
the
pretty
child
,
who
,
half
alarmed
and
half
attract
by
the
brightness
and
the
numerous
company

now
frown
and
hide
her
face
,
now
lift
up
her
head
again
and
look
round
placably
,
until
a
touch
or
a
coax
word
bring
back
the
frown
,
and
make
her
bury
her
face
with
new
determination
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
child

"
 
<EOS>
say
several
lady
at
once
,

,
among
the
rest

Nancy

Godfrey

the
answer
Godfrey
wrung
from
himself
with
a
terrible
effort

(

he
hasten
to

silently

in

of
his

conscience

why

you

better
leave
the

Master
Marner

good
-
natured
Mrs.
Kimble
,
hesitating
,
however
,
to
take
those
dingy
clothe
into
contact
with
her
own
ornamented
satin
bodice

abruptly

<EOS>
"
It
be
come
to
me

"
  
<EOS>
the
proposition
to
take
the
child
from
him
have
come
to
Silas
quite
unexpectedly
,
and
his
speech
,
utter
under
a
strong
sudden
impulse
,
be
almost
like
a
revelation
to
himself
:
<EOS>
a
minute
before
,
he
have
no
distinct
intention
about
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever

Mrs.

in
mild
surprise

to

"
now
,
lady

I
must
trouble
you

stand
aside

say
Mr.
Kimble
,
come
from
the
card

room
,
in
some
bitterness
at
the
interruption
,
but
drill
by
the
long
habit
of
his
profession
into
obedience
to
unpleasant
call
,
even
when
he
be
hardly
sober
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
nasty
business
turn
out
now
,
eh

Kimble

"
 
<EOS>
say
the
Squire

He

growled
uncle
Kimble
,
hasten
out
with
Marner
,
and
follow
by
Mr.
Crackenthorp
and
Godfrey

I

to

anything

only
I

for
the
doctor
,

he
say

at
the
Squire

and
I
make
haste
and
run
,
and
there
be
nobody
to
be
see
at
the
back
o

the
house
,
and
so
I
go
in
to
where

company

"
  
<EOS>
the
child
,
no
longer
distract
by
the
bright
light
and
the
smile
woman
's
face
,
begin
to
cry
and
call
for
"
mammy
"
,
though
always
cling
to
Marner
,
who
have
apparently
win
her
thorough
confidence
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
have
come
back
with
the
boot
,
and
feel
the
cry
as
if
some
fibre
be
draw
tight
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
,
"
he
say
,
hastily
,
eager
for
some
movement
;
"
I
will
go
and
fetch
the
woman
 
Mrs.
Winthrop

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
pooh
 
send
somebody
else

uncle
Kimble

away
with
Marner

<EOS>
"
You
will
let
me
know
if
I
can
be
of
any
use

Kimble

say
Mr.
Crackenthorp
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
be
out
of
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
too
,
have
disappear
:
he
be
go
to
snatch
his
hat
and
coat
,
have
just
reflection
enough
to
remember
that
he
must
not
look
like
a
madman
;
but
he
rush
out
of
the
house
into
the
snow
without
heed
his
thin
shoe
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
he
be
on
his
rapid
way
to
the
Stone
-
pit
by
the
side
of
Dolly
,
who
,
though
feeling
that
she
be
entirely
in
her
place
in
encounter
cold
and
snow
on
an
errand
of
mercy
,
be
much
concerned
at
a
young
gentleman
's
get
his
foot
wet
under
a
like
impulse
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
a
deal
better
go
back
,
sir
,
"
say
Dolly
,
with
respectful
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
call
to
catch
cold
;
and
I
would
ask
you
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
tell
my
husband
to
come
,
on
your
way
back
 
<EOS>
he
be
at
the
Rainbow
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
 
if
you
find
him
anyway
sober
enough
to
be
o

use

<EOS>
or
else
,
there
be
Mrs.
Snell
'
ud
happen
<EOS>
send
the
boy
up
to
fetch
and
carry
,
for
there
may
be
thing
want
from
the
doctor

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
will
stay
,
now
I
be
once
out
 
<EOS>
I
will
stay
outside
here
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
when
they
come
opposite
Marner
's
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
come
and
tell
me
if
I
can
do
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
you
be
very
good
:
you
have
a
tender
heart
,
"
say
Dolly
,
go
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
be
too
painfully
preoccupied
to
feel
a
twinge
of
self
-
reproach
at
this
undeserved
praise
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
up
and
down
,
unconscious
that
he
be
plunge
ankle
-
deep
in
snow
,
unconscious
of
everything
but
tremble
suspense
about
what
be
go
on
in
the
cottage
,
and
the
effect
of
each
alternative
on
his
future
lot
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
quite
unconscious
of
everything
else
.
 
<EOS>
deep
down
,
and
half
-
smother
by
passionate
desire
and
dread
,
there
be
the
sense
that
he
ought
not
to
be
wait
on
these
alternative
;
that
he
ought
to
accept
the
consequence
of
his
deed
,
own
the
miserable
wife
,
and
fulfil
the
claim
of
the
helpless
child
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
moral
courage
enough
to
contemplate
that
active
renunciation
of
Nancy
as
possible
for
him
:
he
have
only
conscience
and
heart
enough
to
make
him
for
ever
uneasy
under
the
weakness
that
forbid
the
renunciation
.
 
<EOS>
and
at
this
moment
his
mind
leap
away
from
all
restraint
toward
the
sudden
prospect
of
deliverance
from
his
long
bondage
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
she
dead
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
the
voice
that
predominate
over
every
other
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
she
be
,
I
may
marry
Nancy
;
and
then
I
shall
be
a
good
fellow
in
future
,
and
have
no
secret
,
and
the
child
 
shall
be
take
care
of
somehow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
but
across
that
vision
come
the
other
possibility
 
<EOS>
"
She
may
live
,
and
then
it
be
all
up
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
never
know
how
long
it
be
before
the
door
of
the
cottage
open
and
Mr.
Kimble
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
forward
to
meet
his
uncle
,
prepare
to
suppress
the
agitation
he
must
feel
,
whatever
news
he
be
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wait
for
you
,
as
I
would
come
so
far
,
"
he
say
,
speak
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
pooh
,
it
be
nonsense
for
you
to
come
out
:
why
do
not
you
send
one
of
the
man
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
She

dead
 
have
be
dead
for
hour

I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
sort
of
woman
be
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
Godfrey
,
feel
the
blood
rush
to
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
young
woman
,
but
emaciate
,
with
long
black
hair

<EOS>
some
vagrant
 
quite
in
rag

She

They
must
fetch
her
away
to
the
workhouse

<EOS>
Come
,
come
along

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
look
at
her
,
"
say
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
see
such
a
woman
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
overtake
you
in
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kimble
go
on
,
and
Godfrey
turn
back
to
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
He
cast
only
one
glance
at
the
dead
face
on
the
pillow
,
which
Dolly
have
smooth
with
decent
care
;
but
he
remember
that
last
look
at
his
unhappy
hate
wife
so
well
,
that
at
the
end
of
sixteen
year
every
line
in
the
worn
face
be
present
to
him
when
he
tell
the
full
story
of
this
night
.
  
<EOS>
He
turn
immediately
towards
the
hearth
,
where
Silas
Marner
sit
lull
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
perfectly
quiet
now
,
but
not
asleep
 
only
soothe
by
sweet
porridge
and
warmth
into
that
wide
-
gaze
calm
which
make
us
old
human
being
,
with
our
inward
turmoil
,
feel
a
certain
awe
in
the
presence
of
a
little
child
,
such
as
we
feel
before
some
quiet
majesty
or
beauty
in
the
earth
or
sky
 
before
a
steady
glowing
planet
,
or
a
full
-
flowered
eglantine
,
or
the
bend
tree
over
a
silent
pathway
.
 
<EOS>
the
wide
-
open
blue
eye
look
up
at
Godfrey
's
without
any
uneasiness
or
sign
of
recognition
:
the
child
could
make
no
visible
audible
claim
on
its
father
;
and
the
father
feel
a
strange
mixture
of
feeling
,
a
conflict
of
regret
and
joy
,
that
the
pulse
of
that
little
heart
have
no
response
for
the
half
-
jealous
yearning
in
his
own
,
when
the
blue
eye
turn
away
from
him
slowly
,
and
fix
themselves
on
the
weaver
's
queer
face
,
which
be
bent
low
down
to
look
at
them
,
while
the
small
hand
begin
to
pull
Marner
's
withered
cheek
with
loving
disfiguration
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
the
child
to
the
parish
to
-
morrow
?
"
 
<EOS>
ask
Godfrey
,
speak
as
indifferently
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
say
so
?

<EOS>
say
Marner
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
they
make
me
take
her
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
why

Marner

"
the
mother

dead

It

that
be
strange
for
a

him

I
give

a

out

no

glad
of
the
subterfuge
his

have
suggest
to
him

<EOS>
the
prevarication

white
lie
which
a

that

itself
ambitiously
pure

as
uneasy
under

Godfrey
reappear
in

,
since
the
truth
must

tell

with
a
sense
of
relief

gladness
that
be

strong
for
painful
thought

for
could

whenever
opportunity

to
promise

<EOS>
there
be
no
danger
that
his

would
be
recognize

those
be
not

active
inquiry

wide
report

as
for

that
be

Dunsey
may

and
when

turn
out

it

<EOS>
when

just
we
should

after

would

away
his

nay

her

<EOS>
for

<EOS>
as
for

he
would
see

he

never
forsake
it

he
would
do
everything

own
it

<EOS>
perhaps
it
would
be
just
as
happy
in
life
without
be
own
by
its

see
that
nobody
could
tell
how

would
turn
out

well

His

for
she
have
speak
from
the
depth

simple

be
much
concerned
to
know
whether

He
be
puzzled

anxious
,
for

I
will
ask
Mr.

to
speak
to

you

My

I

It

a

you

it
be
awk'ard

your

such
a
hard

when
you
would

nothing
big

<EOS>
Baby
_
be
_
christen
,
the
rector
decide
that
a
double
baptism
be
the
less
risk
to
incur
;
and
on
this
occasion
Silas
,
make
himself
as
clean
and
tidy
as
he
could
,
appear
for
the
first
time
within
the
church
,
and
share
in
the
observance
hold
sacred
by
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
unable
,
by
mean
of
anything
he
hear
or
see
,
to
identify
the
Raveloe
religion
with
his
old
faith
;
if
he
could
at
any
time
in
his
previous
life
have
do
so
,
it
must
have
be
by
the
aid
of
a
strong
feeling
ready
to
vibrate
with
sympathy
,
rather
than
by
a
comparison
of
phrase
and
idea
:
and
now
for
long
year
that
feeling
have
be
dormant
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
distinct
idea
about
the
baptism
and
the
church
-
go
,
except
that
Dolly
have
say
it
be
for
the
good
of
the
child
;
and
in
this
way
,
as
the
week
grow
to
month
,
the
child
create
fresh
and
fresh
link
between
his
life
and
the
life
from
which
he
have
hitherto
shrink
continually
into
narrow
isolation
.
 
<EOS>
unlike
the
gold
which
need
nothing
,
and
must
be
worship
in
close
-
lock
solitude
 
which
be
hide
away
from
the
daylight
,
be
deaf
to
the
song
of
bird
,
and
start
to
no
human
tone
 
<EOS>
Eppie
be
a
creature
of
endless
claim
and
ever

grow
desire
,
seek
and
love
sunshine
,
and
living
sound
,
and
live
movement

make
trial
of
everything

stir
the

in

<EOS>
the
gold
have
keep
his
thought
in
an
ever

repeat
circle
,
lead
to
nothing
beyond
itself
;
but
Eppie
be
an
object
compact
of
change
and
hope
that
force
his
thought
onward
,
and
carry
them
far
away
from
their
old
eager
pacing
towards
the
same
blank
limit
 
carry
them
away
to
the
new
thing
that
would
come
with
the
come
year
,
when
Eppie
would
have
learn
to
understand
how
her
father
Silas
care
for
her
;
and
make
him
look
for
image
of
that
time
in
the
tie
and
charity
that
bind
together
the
family
of
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
the
gold
have
ask
that
he
should
sit
weave
longer
and
longer
,
deafen
and
blind
more
and
more
to
all
thing
except
the
monotony
of
his
loom
and
the
repetition
of
his
web
;
but
Eppie
call
him
away
from
his
weaving
,
and
make
him
think
all
its
pause
a
holiday
,
reawaken
his
sense
with
her
fresh
life
,
even
to
the
old
winter
-
fly
that
come
crawl
forth
in
the
early
spring
sunshine
,
and
warm
him
into
joy
because
_
<EOS>
she
_
have
joy
.
  
<EOS>
and
when
the
sunshine
grow
strong
and
lasting
,
so
that
the
buttercup
be
thick
in
the
meadow
,
Silas
may
be
see
in
the
sunny
midday
,
or
in
the
late
afternoon
when
the
shadow
be
lengthen
under
the
hedgerow
,
stroll
out
with
uncovered
head
to
carry
Eppie
beyond
the
Stone
-
pit
to
where
the
flower
grow
,
till
they
reach
some
favourite
bank
where
he
could
sit
down
,
while
Eppie
toddle
to
pluck
the
flower
,
and
make
remark
to
the
wing
thing
that
murmur
happily
above
the
bright
petal
,
call
"
Dad
-
dad
's
"
attention
continually
by
bring
him
the
flower
.
<EOS>
then
she
would
turn
her
ear
to
some
sudden
bird
-
note
,
and
Silas
learn
to
please
her
by
make
sign
of
hushed
stillness
,
that
they
may
listen
for
the
note
to
come
again
:
so
that
when
it
come
,
she
set
up
her
small
back
and
laugh
with
gurgle
triumph
.
<EOS>
sit
on
the
bank
in
this
way
,
Silas
begin
to
look
for
the
once
familiar
herb
again
;
and
as
the
leave
,
with
their
unchanged
outline
and
marking
,
lie
on
his
palm
,
there
be
a
sense
of
crowd
remembrance
from
which
he
turn
away
timidly
,
take
refuge
in
Eppie
's
little
world
,
that
lie
lightly
on
his
enfeebled
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
child
's
mind
be
grow
into
knowledge
,
his
mind
be
grow
into
memory
:
as
her
life
unfold
,
his
soul
,
long
stupefy
in
a
cold
narrow
prison
,
be
unfold
too
,
and
tremble
gradually
into
full
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
influence
which
must
gather
force
with
every
new
year
:
the
tone
that
stir
Silas
's
heart
grow
articulate
,
and
call
for
more
distinct
answer
;
shape
and
sound
grow
clear
for
Eppie
's
eye
and
ear
,
and
there
be
more
that
"
Dad
-
dad
"
be
imperatively
require
to
notice
and
account
for
.
 
<EOS>
also
,
by
the
time
Eppie
be
three
year
old
,
she
develop
a
fine
capacity
for
mischief
,
and
for
devise
ingenious
way
of
be
troublesome
,
which
find
much
exercise
,
not
only
for
Silas
's
patience
,
but
for
his
watchfulness
and
penetration
.
 
<EOS>
sorely
be
poor
Silas
puzzle
on
such
occasion
by
the
incompatible
demand
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
Winthrop
tell
him
that
punishment
be
good
for
Eppie
,
and
that
,
as
for
rear
a
child
without
make
it
tingle
a
little
in
soft
and
safe
place
now
and
then
,
it
be
not
to
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
there
be
another
thing
you
may
do
,
Master
Marner
,
"
add
Dolly
,
meditatively
:
"
<EOS>
you
may
shut
her
up
once
i
'
the
coal
-
hole
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
do
wi
'
Aaron
;
for
I
be
that
silly
<EOS>
wi
'
the
young
lad
,
as
I
could
never
bear
to
smack
him
.
 
<EOS>
not
as
I
could
find
i
'
my
heart
to
let
him
stay
i
'
the
coal
-
hole
more
nor
a
minute
,
but
it
be
enough
to
colly
him
all
over
,
so
as
he
must
be
new
wash
and
dress
,
and
it
be
as
good
as
a
rod
to
him
 
that
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
put
it
upo
'
<EOS>
your
conscience
,
Master
Marner
,
as
there
be
one
of
'em
<EOS>
you
must
choose
 
ayther
smacking
or
the
coal
-
hole
 
else
she
will
get
so
masterful
,
there
will
be
no
hold
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
be
impressed
with
the
melancholy
truth
of
this
last
remark
;
but
his
force
of
mind
fail
before
the
only
two
penal
method
open
to
him
,
not
only
because
it
be
painful
to
him
to
hurt
Eppie
,
but
because
he
tremble
at
a
moment
's
contention
with
her
,
lest
she
should
love
him
the
less
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
let
even
an
affectionate
Goliath
get
himself
tie
to
a
small
tender
thing
,
dread
to
hurt
it
by
pull
,
and
dread
still
more
to
snap
the
cord
,
and
which
of
the
two
,
pray
,
will
be
master
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
Eppie
,
with
her
short
toddling
step
,
must
lead
father
Silas
a
pretty
dance
on
any
fine
morning
when
circumstance
favour
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
for
example
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
wisely
choose
a
broad
strip
of
linen
as
a
means
of
fasten
her
to
his
loom
when
he
be
busy
:
it
make
a
broad
belt
round
her
waist
,
and
be
long
enough
to
allow
of
her
reach
the
truckle
-
bed
and
sit
down
on
it
,
but
not
long
enough
for
her
to
attempt
any
dangerous
climbing
.
 
<EOS>
one
bright
summer
's
morning
<EOS>
Silas
have
be
more
engrossed
than
usual
in
"
set
up
"
a
new
piece
of
work
,
an
occasion
on
which
his
scissor
be
in
requisition
.
 
<EOS>
these
scissor
,
owe
to
an
especial
warning
of
Dolly
's
,
have
be
keep
carefully
out
of
Eppie
's
reach
;
but
the
click
of
them
have
have
a
peculiar
attraction
for
her
ear
,
and
watch
the
result
of
that
click
,
she
have
derive
the
philosophic
lesson
that
the
same
cause
would
produce
the
same
effect
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
have
seat
himself
in
his
loom
,
and
the
noise
of
weaving
have
begin
;
but
he
have
leave
his
scissor
on
a
ledge
which
Eppie
's
arm
be
long
enough
to
reach
;
and
now
,
like
a
small
mouse
,
watch
her
opportunity
,
she
steal
quietly
from
her
corner
,
secure
the
scissor
,
and
toddle
to
the
bed
again
,
set
up
her
back
as
a
mode
of
conceal
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
distinct
intention
as
to
the
use
of
the
scissor
;
and
have
cut
the
linen
strip
in
a
jagged
but
effectual
manner
,
in
two
moment
she
have
run
out
at
the
open
door
where
the
sunshine
be
invite
her
,
while
poor
Silas
believe
her
to
be
a
well
child
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
he
happen
to
need
his
scissor
that
the
terrible
fact
burst
upon
him
<EOS>
:
Eppie
have
run
out
by
herself
 
have
perhaps
fall
into
the
Stone
-
pit
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
,
shake
by
the
bad
fear
that
could
have
befall
him
,
rush
out
,
call
"
Eppie
!
"
 
and
run
eagerly
about
the
unenclosed
space
,
explore
the
dry
cavity
into
which
she
may
have
fall
,
and
then
gaze
with
question
dread
at
the
smooth
red
surface
of
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
the
cold
drop
stand
on
his
brow
.
<EOS>
how
long
have
she
be
out
?
<EOS>
there
be
one
hope
 
that
she
have
creep
through
the
stile
and
get
into
the
field
,
where
he
habitually
take
her
to
stroll
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
grass
be
high
in
the
meadow
,
and
there
be
no
descry
her
,
if
she
be
there
,
except
by
a
close
search
that
would
be
a
trespass
on
Mr.
Osgood
's
crop
.
<EOS>
still
,
that
misdemeanour
must
be
commit
;
and
poor
Silas
,
after
peer
all
round
the
hedgerow
,
traverse
the
grass
,
begin
with
perturbed
vision
to
see
Eppie
behind
every
group
of
red
sorrel
,
and
to
see
her
move
always
farther
off
as
he
approach
.
 
<EOS>
the
meadow
be
search
in
vain
;
and
he
get
over
the
stile
into
the
next
field
,
look
with
die
hope
towards
a
small
pond
which
be
now
reduce
to
its
summer
shallowness
,
so
as
to
leave
a
wide
margin
of
good
adhesive
mud
.
<EOS>
here
,
however
,
sit
Eppie
,
discourse
cheerfully
to
her
own
small
boot
,
which
she
be
use
as
a
bucket
to
convey
the
water
into
a
deep
hoof
-
mark
,
while
her
little
naked
foot
be
plant
comfortably
on
a
cushion
of
olive
-
green
mud
.
 
<EOS>
a
red
-
head
calf
be
observe
her
with
alarmed
doubt
through
the
opposite
hedge
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
clearly
a
case
of
aberration
in
a
christened
child
which
demand
severe
treatment
;
but
Silas
,
overcome
with
convulsive
joy
at
find
his
treasure
again
,
could
do
nothing
but
snatch
her
up
,
and
cover
her
with
half
-
sob
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
he
have
carry
her
home
,
and
have
begin
to
think
of
the
necessary
washing
<EOS>
,
that
he
recollect
the
need
that
he
should
punish
Eppie
,
and
"
make
her
remember
"
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
that
she
may
run
away
again
and
come
to
harm
,
give
him
unusual
resolution
,
and
for
the
first
time
he
determine
to
try
the
coal
-
hole
 
a
small
closet
near
the
hearth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Naughty
,
naughty
Eppie
,
"
he
suddenly
begin
,
hold
her
on
his
knee
,
and
point
to
her
muddy
foot
and
clothe
 
"
naughty
to
cut
with
the
scissor
and
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
Eppie
must
go
into
the
coal
-
hole
for
be
naughty
.
 
<EOS>
daddy
must
put
her
in
the
coal
-
hole
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
half
-
expect
that
this
would
be
shock
enough
,
and
that
Eppie
would
begin
to
cry
.
 
<EOS>
but
instead
of
that
,
she
begin
to
shake
herself
on
his
knee
,
as
if
the
proposition
open
a
pleasing
novelty
.
<EOS>
see
that
he
must
proceed
to
extremity
,
he
put
her
into
the
coal
-
hole
,
and
hold
the
door
close
,
with
a
tremble
sense
that
he
be
use
a
strong
measure
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
moment
there
be
silence
,
but
then
come
a
little
cry
,
"
opy
,
opy
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
Silas
let
her
out
again
,
say
,
"
now
Eppie
'
ull
never
be
naughty
again
,
else
she
must
go
in
the
coal
-
hole
 
<EOS>
a
black
naughty
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
weaving
must
stand
still
a
long
while
this
morning
,
for
now
Eppie
must
be
wash
,
and
have
clean
clothe
on
;
but
it
be
to
be
hope
that
this
punishment
would
have
a
lasting
effect
,
and
save
time
in
future
 
though
,
perhaps
<EOS>
,
it
would
have
be
well
if
Eppie
have
cry
more
.
  
<EOS>
in
half
an
hour
she
be
clean
again
,
and
Silas
have
turn
his
back
to
see
what
he
could
do
with
the
linen
band
,
throw
it
down
again
,
with
the
reflection
that
Eppie
would
be
good
without
fasten
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
round
again
,
and
be
go
to
place
her
in
her
little
chair
near
the
loom
,
when
she
peep
out
at
him
with
black
face
and
hand
again
,
and
say
,
"
Eppie
in
de
toal
-
hole
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
total
failure
of
the
coal
-
hole
discipline
shake
Silas
's
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
would
take
it
all
for
fun
,
"
he
observe
to
Dolly
,
"
if
I
do
not
hurt
her
,
and
that
I
can
not
do
,
Mrs.
Winthrop
.
<EOS>
if
she
make
me
a
bit
o
'
trouble
,
I
can
bear
it
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
get
no
trick
but
<EOS>
what
she
will
grow
out
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
that
be
partly
true
,
Master
Marner
,
"
say
Dolly
,
sympathetically
;
"
and
if
you
can
not
bring
your
mind
to
frighten
her
off
touching
thing
,
you
must
do
what
you
can
to
keep
'em
out
of
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
do
wi
'
the
pup
as
the
lad
be
allay
a
-
rearing
.
 
<EOS>
They
_
<EOS>
will
_
worry
and
gnaw
 
worry
and
gnaw
<EOS>
they
will
,
if
it
be
one
's
Sunday
cap
as
hang
anywhere
so
as
they
could
drag
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
know
no
difference
<EOS>
,
God
help
'em
:
it
be
the
pushing
o
'
the
tooth
as
set
'em
on
<EOS>
,
that
be
what
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
Eppie
be
rear
without
punishment
,
the
burden
of
her
misdeed
be
bear
vicariously
by
father
Silas
.
 
<EOS>
the
stone
hut
be
make
a
soft
nest
for
her
,
line
with
downy
patience
:
and
also
in
the
world
that
lie
beyond
the
stone
hut
<EOS>
she
know
nothing
of
frown
and
denial
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
difficulty
of
carry
her
and
his
yarn
or
linen
at
the
same
time
,
Silas
take
her
with
him
in
most
of
his
journey
to
the
farmhouse
,
unwilling
to
leave
her
behind
at
Dolly
Winthrop
's
,
who
be
always
ready
to
take
care
of
her
;
and
little
curly
-
head
Eppie
,
the
weaver
's
child
,
become
an
object
of
interest
at
several
outlying
homestead
,
as
well
as
in
the
village
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
have
be
treat
very
much
as
if
he
have
be
a
useful
gnome
or
brownie
 
a
queer
and
unaccountable
creature
,
who
must
necessarily
be
look
at
with
wonder
curiosity
and
repulsion
,
and
with
whom
one
would
be
glad
to
make
all
greeting
and
bargain
as
brief
as
possible
,
but
who
must
be
deal
with
in
a
propitiatory
way
,
and
occasionally
have
a
present
of
pork
or
garden
stuff
to
carry
home
with
him
,
see
that
without
him
there
be
no
get
the
yarn
weave
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
Silas
meet
with
open
smile
face
and
cheerful
questioning
,
as
a
person
whose
satisfaction
and
difficulty
could
be
understand
.
 
<EOS>
everywhere
he
must
sit
a
little
and
talk
about
the
child
,
and
word
of
interest
be
always
ready
for
him
:
"
<EOS>
ah
,
Master
Marner
,
you
will
be
lucky
if
she
take
the
measle
soon
and
easy
!
"
 
<EOS>
or
,
"
why
,
there
be
not
many
lone
man
'
<EOS>
ud
ha
'
be
wish
to
take
up
with
a
little
un
like
that
:
but
I
reckon
the
weaving
make
you
handy
than
man
as
do
out
-
door
work
 
<EOS>
you
be
partly
as
handy
as
a
woman
,
for
weaving
come
next
to
spinning
.
"
 
<EOS>
elderly
master
and
mistress
,
seat
observantly
in
large
kitchen
arm
-
chair
,
shake
their
head
over
the
difficulty
attendant
on
rear
child
,
feel
Eppie
's
round
arm
and
leg
,
and
pronounce
them
remarkably
firm
,
and
tell
Silas
that
,
if
she
turn
out
well
(
which
,
however
,
there
be
no
telling
)
,
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
him
to
have
a
steady
lass
to
do
for
him
when
he
get
helpless
.
 
<EOS>
servant
maiden
be
fond
of
carry
her
out
to
look
at
the
hen
and
chicken
,
or
to
see
if
any
cherry
could
be
shake
down
in
the
orchard
;
and
the
small
boy
and
girl
approach
her
slowly
,
with
cautious
movement
and
steady
gaze
,
like
little
dog
face
to
face
with
one
of
their
own
kind
,
till
attraction
have
reach
the
point
at
which
the
soft
lip
be
put
out
for
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
no
child
be
afraid
of
approach
Silas
when
Eppie
be
near
him
:
there
be
no
repulsion
around
him
now
,
either
for
young
or
old
;
for
the
little
child
have
come
to
link
him
once
more
with
the
whole
world
.
<EOS>
there
be
love
between
him
and
the
child
that
blent
them
into
one
,
and
there
be
love
between
the
child
and
the
world
 
from
man
and
woman
with
parental
look
and
tone
,
to
the
red
lady
-
bird
and
the
round
pebble
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
begin
now
to
think
of
Raveloe
life
entirely
in
relation
to
Eppie
:
she
must
have
everything
that
be
a
good
in
Raveloe
;
and
he
listen
docilely
,
that
he
may
come
to
understand
well
what
this
life
be
,
from
which
,
for
fifteen
year
,
he
have
stand
aloof
as
from
a
strange
thing
,
with
which
he
could
have
no
communion
:
as
some
man
who
have
a
precious
plant
to
which
he
would
give
a
nurturing
home
in
a
new
soil
,
think
of
the
rain
,
and
the
sunshine
,
and
all
influence
,
in
relation
to
his
nursling
,
and
ask
industriously
for
all
knowledge
that
will
help
him
to
satisfy
the
want
of
the
search
root
,
or
to
guard
leaf
and
bud
from
invade
harm
.
 
<EOS>
the
disposition
to
hoard
have
be
utterly
crush
at
the
very
first
by
the
loss
of
his
long
-
store
gold
:
the
coin
he
earn
afterwards
seem
as
irrelevant
as
stone
bring
to
complete
a
house
suddenly
bury
by
an
earthquake
;
the
sense
of
bereavement
be
too
heavy
upon
him
for
the
old
thrill
of
satisfaction
to
arise
again
at
the
touch
of
the
newly
-
earn
coin
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
something
have
come
to
replace
his
hoard
which
give
a
grow
purpose
to
the
earning
,
draw
his
hope
and
joy
continually
onward
beyond
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
in
old
day
there
be
angel
who
come
and
take
man
by
the
hand
and
lead
them
away
from
the
city
of
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
We
see
no
white
-
winged
angel
now
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
man
be
lead
away
from
threaten
destruction
<EOS>
:
a
hand
be
put
into
theirs
,
which
lead
them
forth
gently
towards
a
calm
and
bright
land
,
so
that
they
look
no
more
backward
;
and
the
hand
may
be
a
little
child
's
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
one
person
,
as
you
will
believe
,
who
watch
with
keener
though
more
hide
interest
than
any
other
,
the
prosperous
growth
of
Eppie
under
the
weaver
's
care
.
 
<EOS>
He
dare
not
do
anything
that
would
imply
a
strong
interest
in
a
poor
man
's
adopt
child
than
could
be
expect
from
the
kindliness
of
the
young
Squire
,
when
a
chance
meeting
suggest
a
little
present
to
a
simple
old
fellow
whom
other
notice
with
goodwill
;
but
he
tell
himself
that
the
time
would
come
when
he
may
do
something
towards
further
the
welfare
of
his
daughter
without
incur
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
be
he
very
uneasy
in
the
meantime
at
his
inability
to
give
his
daughter
her
birthright
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
be
be
take
care
of
,
and
would
very
likely
be
happy
,
as
people
in
humble
station
often
be
 
happier
,
perhaps
,
than
those
bring
up
in
luxury
.
  
<EOS>
that
famous
ring
that
prick
its
owner
when
he
forget
duty
and
follow
desire
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
it
prick
very
hard
when
he
set
out
on
the
chase
,
or
whether
it
prick
but
lightly
then
,
and
only
pierce
to
the
quick
when
the
chase
have
long
be
end
,
and
hope
,
fold
her
wing
,
look
backward
and
become
regret
?
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
Cass
's
cheek
and
eye
be
bright
than
ever
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
undivided
in
his
aim
,
that
he
seem
like
a
man
of
firmness
.
 
<EOS>
no
Dunsey
have
come
back
:
people
have
make
up
their
mind
that
he
be
go
for
a
soldier
,
or
go
"
out
of
the
country
"
,
and
no
one
care
to
be
specific
in
their
inquiry
on
a
subject
delicate
to
a
respectable
family
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
have
cease
to
see
the
shadow
of
Dunsey
across
his
path
;
and
the
path
now
lie
straight
forward
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
good
,
longest
-
cherish
wish
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
say
Mr.
Godfrey
have
take
the
right
turn
;
and
it
be
pretty
clear
what
would
be
the
end
of
thing
,
for
there
be
not
many
day
in
the
week
that
he
be
not
see
ride
to
the
Warrens
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
himself
,
when
he
be
ask
jocosely
if
the
day
have
be
fix
,
smile
with
the
pleasant
consciousness
of
a
lover
who
could
say
"
yes
"
,
if
he
like
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
a
reformed
man
,
deliver
from
temptation
;
and
the
vision
of
his
future
life
seem
to
him
as
a
promise
land
for
which
he
have
no
cause
to
fight
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
himself
with
all
his
happiness
centre
on
his
own
hearth
,
while
Nancy
would
smile
on
him
as
he
play
with
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
and
that
other
child
 
not
on
the
hearth
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
forget
it
;
he
would
see
that
it
be
well
provide
for
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
father
's
duty
.
      
<EOS>
It
be
a
bright
autumn
Sunday
,
sixteen
year
after
Silas
Marner
have
find
his
new
treasure
on
the
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
the
bell
of
the
old
Raveloe
church
be
ring
the
cheerful
peal
which
tell
that
the
morning
service
be
end
;
and
out
of
the
arched
doorway
in
the
tower
come
slowly
,
retard
by
friendly
greeting
and
question
,
the
rich
parishioner
who
have
choose
this
bright
Sunday
morning
as
eligible
for
church
-
going
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
rural
fashion
of
that
time
for
the
more
important
member
of
the
congregation
to
depart
first
,
while
their
humble
neighbour
wait
and
look
on
,
stroke
their
bent
head
or
drop
their
curtsy
to
any
large
ratepayer
who
turn
to
notice
them
.
  
<EOS>
foremost
among
these
advance
group
of
well
-
clothe
people
,
there
be
some
whom
we
shall
recognize
,
in
spite
of
Time
,
who
have
lay
his
hand
on
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
tall
blond
man
of
forty
be
not
much
change
in
feature
from
the
Godfrey
Cass
of
six
-
and
-
twenty
:
he
be
only
full
in
flesh
,
and
have
only
lose
the
indefinable
look
of
youth
 
<EOS>
a
loss
which
be
mark
even
when
the
eye
be
undulle
and
the
wrinkle
be
not
yet
come
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
pretty
woman
,
not
much
young
than
he
,
who
be
lean
on
his
arm
,
be
more
changed
than
her
husband
:
the
lovely
bloom
that
use
to
be
always
on
her
cheek
now
come
but
fitfully
,
with
the
fresh
morning
air
or
with
some
strong
surprise
;
yet
to
all
who
love
human
face
best
for
what
they
tell
of
human
experience
,
Nancy
's
beauty
have
a
heightened
interest
.
 
<EOS>
often
the
soul
be
ripen
into
full
goodness
while
age
have
spread
an
ugly
film
,
so
that
mere
glance
can
never
divine
the
preciousness
of
the
fruit
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
year
have
not
be
so
cruel
to
Nancy
.
 
<EOS>
the
firm
yet
placid
mouth
,
the
clear
veracious
glance
of
the
brown
eye
,
speak
now
of
a
nature
that
have
be
test
and
have
keep
its
high
quality
;
and
even
the
costume
,
with
its
dainty
neatness
and
purity
,
have
more
significance
now
the
coquetry
of
youth
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Godfrey
Cass
(
any
high
title
have
die
away
from
Raveloe
lip
since
the
old
Squire
be
gather
to
his
father
and
his
inheritance
<EOS>
be
divide
)
have
turn
round
to
look
for
the
tall
aged
man
and
the
plainly
dressed
woman
who
be
a
little
behind
 
Nancy
have
observe
that
they
must
wait
for
"
father
and
Priscilla
"
 
<EOS>
and
now
they
all
turn
into
a
narrow
path
lead
across
the
churchyard
to
a
small
gate
opposite
the
Red
House
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
not
follow
them
now
;
for
may
there
not
be
some
other
in
this
depart
congregation
whom
we
should
like
to
see
again
 
some
of
those
who
be
not
likely
to
be
handsomely
clothe
,
and
whom
we
may
not
recognize
so
easily
as
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
Red
House
?
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
impossible
to
mistake
Silas
Marner
.
 
<EOS>
His
large
brown
eye
seem
to
have
gather
a
long
vision
,
as
be
the
way
with
eye
that
have
be
short
-
sight
in
early
life
,
and
they
have
a
less
vague
,
a
more
answering
gaze
;
but
in
everything
else
one
see
sign
of
a
frame
much
enfeeble
by
the
lapse
of
the
sixteen
year
.
 
<EOS>
the
weaver
's
bent
shoulder
and
white
hair
give
him
almost
the
look
of
advanced
age
,
though
he
be
not
more
than
five
-
and
-
fifty
;
but
there
be
the
fresh
blossom
of
youth
close
by
his
side
 
a
blonde
dimpled
girl
of
eighteen
,
who
have
vainly
try
to
chastise
her
curly
auburn
hair
into
smoothness
under
her
brown
bonnet
:
the
hair
ripple
as
obstinately
as
a
brooklet
under
the
March
breeze
,
and
the
little
ringlet
burst
away
from
the
restrain
comb
behind
and
show
themselves
below
the
bonnet
-
crown
.
<EOS>
Eppie
can
not
help
be
rather
vexed
about
her
hair
,
for
there
be
no
other
girl
in
Raveloe
who
have
hair
at
all
like
it
,
and
she
think
hair
ought
to
be
smooth
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
like
to
be
blameworthy
even
in
small
thing
<EOS>
:
you
see
how
neatly
her
prayer
-
book
be
fold
in
her
spot
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
that
good
-
look
young
fellow
,
in
a
new
fustian
suit
,
who
walk
behind
her
,
be
not
quite
sure
upon
the
question
of
hair
in
the
abstract
,
when
Eppie
put
it
to
him
,
and
think
that
perhaps
straight
hair
be
the
good
in
general
,
but
he
do
not
want
Eppie
's
hair
to
be
different
.
 
<EOS>
She
surely
divine
that
there
be
some
one
behind
her
who
be
think
about
her
very
particularly
,
and
muster
courage
to
come
to
her
side
as
soon
as
they
be
out
in
the
lane
,
else
why
should
she
look
rather
shy
,
and
take
care
not
to
turn
away
her
head
from
her
father
Silas
,
to
whom
she
keep
murmur
little
sentence
as
to
who
be
at
church
and
who
be
not
at
church
,
and
how
pretty
the
red
mountain
-
ash
be
over
the
Rectory
wall
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
_
we
_
have
a
little
garden
,
father
,
with
double
daisy
in
,
like
Mrs.
Winthrop
's
,
"
say
Eppie
,
when
they
be
out
in
the
lane
;
"
only
they
say
it
'
ud
take
a
deal
of
dig
and
bring
fresh
soil
 
<EOS>
and
you
could
not
do
that
,
<EOS>
could
you
,
father
?
 
<EOS>
anyhow
,
I
should
not
like
you
to
do
it
,
for
it
'
ud
be
too
hard
work
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
could
do
it
,
child
,
if
you
want
a
bit
o

garden
:
these
long
evening
,
I
could
work
at

in
a
little
bit
<EOS>
o
'
the
waste
,
just
enough
for
a
root
or
two
o
'
flower
for
you
;
and
again
,
i
'
<EOS>
the
morning
,
I
could
have
a
turn
wi
'
the
spade
before
I
sit
down
to
the
loom
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
tell
me
before
as
you
want
a
bit
o

garden
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
_
I
_
can
dig
it
for
you
,
Master
Marner
,
"
say
the
young
man
in
fustian
,
who
be
now
by
Eppie
's
side
,
enter
into
the
conversation
without
the
trouble
of
formality
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
play
to
me
after
I
have
do
my
day
's
work
,
or
any
odd
bit
<EOS>
o
'
time
when
the
work
's
slack

<EOS>
and
I
will
bring
you
some
soil
from
Mr.

he
will
let
me
,

willing

Aaron

my
lad
,
be
you
there

Silas
;

I
be

for
when

Aaron
,

I
will
come
to
the
Stone

pit
this
afternoon

we

settle
what

in

I

get
up
an
hour
earlier

i

the
morning
,

begin
on

"
  
"
<EOS>
but
not
if
you
do
not
promise
me
not
to
work
at
the
hard
digging

father

for
I

she
add
,
half

bashfully

half
-
roguishly

only
Mrs.

so
good

and
Master

know
too
,
I
hope
,
as
I
be
able

willing
to
do
a
turn
o

work
for
him
,

he

out

there

now
,
father

you
will
not

it
till
it
be
all
easy
,
"

Eppie
,
"
and
you
and
me
can
mark
out
the
bed
,
and
make
hole
and
plant
the
root
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
deal
livelier
at
the
Stone
-
pit
when
we
have
get
some
flower
,
<EOS>
for
I
always
think
the
flower
can
see
us
and
know
what
we
be
talk
about

<EOS>
and
I
will
have
a
bit
o

rosemary
,
and
bergamot
,
and
thyme
,
because
they
be
so
sweet
-
smell
;
but
there
be
no
lavender
only
in
the
gentlefolk
'
garden
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
no
reason
why
you
should
not

say
Aaron
,

for
I
can
bring
you
slip
of
anything

;
I
be
force
to
cut
no
end
of
'em
when
I
be
garden

throw
'em
away
mostly
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
<EOS>
a
big
bed
o

lavender
at
the
Red
House

:
the
missis
be
very
fond
of
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
well

Silas

gravely
,
"
so
as
you
do
not

free
for

for
Mr.

up

<EOS>
"
no

there

somebody

up

It

there

nobody

with

"
  
<EOS>
Eppie
be
now
aware
that
her
behaviour
be
under
observation
,
but
it
be
only
the
observation
of
a
friendly
donkey
,
browse
with
a
log
fasten
to
his
foot
 
<EOS>
a
meek
donkey
,
not
scornfully
critical
of
human
triviality

thankful
to
share
in
them

if
possible

by
get
his

to
gratify
him
with
her
usual
notice

it

attend
with
the
inconvenience

his
follow
them

painfully

up
to

but
the
sound
of
a
sharp
bark
inside

as
Eppie
put
the
key
in
the
door
,
modify
the
donkey
's
view

he
limp
away
again
without

the
sharp
bark
be
the
sign
of
an
excited
welcome
that
be
await
them
from
a
know
brown
terrier
,
who
,
after
dance
at
their
leg
in
a
hysterical
manner
,
rush
with
a
worrying
noise
at
a
tortoise
-
shell
kitten
under
the
loom
,
and
then
rush
back
with
a
sharp
bark
again
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
I
have
do
my
duty
by
this
feeble
creature
,
you
perceive
"
;
while
the
lady
-
mother
of
the
kitten
sit
sun
her
white
bosom
in
the
window
,
and
look
round
with
a
sleepy
air
of
expecting
caress
,
though
she
be
not
go
to
take
any
trouble
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
presence
of
this
happy
animal
life
be
not
the
only
change
which
have
come
over
the
interior
of
the
stone
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
bed
now
in
the
living

room
,
and
the
small
space
be
well
fill
with
decent
furniture
,
all
bright
and
clean
enough
to
satisfy
Dolly
Winthrop
's
eye

<EOS>
the
oaken
table
and
three
-
corner
oaken
chair
be
hardly
what
be
likely
to
be
see
in
so
poor
a
cottage
:
they
have
come
,
with
the
bed
and
other
thing
,
from
the
Red
House
;
for
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
,
as
every
one
say
in
the
village
,
do
very
kindly
by
the
weaver
;
and
it
be
nothing
<EOS>
but
right
a
man
should
be
look
on
and
help
by
those
who
could
afford
it
,
when
he
have
bring
up
an
orphan
child
,
and
be
father
and
mother
to
her
 
and
have
lose
his
money
too
,
so
as
he
have
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
he
work
for
week
by
week
,
and
when
the
weaving
be
go
down
too
 
for
there
be
<EOS>
less

less
flax
spin

Master
Marner
be
none
so
young

<EOS>
nobody
be
jealous
of

for
he
be
regard
as
an
exceptional
person
,
whose
claim
on
neighbourly
help
be
not
to
be
match
in
Raveloe
.
 
<EOS>
any
superstition
that
remain
concern
him
have
take
an
entirely
new
colour
;
and
Mr.
Macey
,
now
a
very
feeble
old
man
of
fourscore
and
six
,
never
see
except
in
his
chimney
-
corner
or
sit
in
the
sunshine
at
his
door
-
sill
,
be
of
opinion
that
when
a
man
have
do
what
Silas
have
do
by
an
orphan
child
,
it
be
a
sign
that
his
money
would
come
to
light
again
,
or
leastwise
that
the
robber
would
be
make
to
answer
for
it
 
for
,
as
Mr.
Macey
observe
of
himself
,
his
faculty
be
as
strong
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
sit
down
now
and
watch
Eppie
with
a
satisfied
gaze
as
she
spread
the
clean
cloth
,
and
set
on
it
the
potato
-
pie
,
warm
up
slowly
in
a
safe
Sunday
fashion
,
by
be
put
into
a
dry
pot
over
a
slowly
-
die
fire
,
as
the
good
substitute
for
an
oven
.
 
<EOS>
for
Silas
would
not
consent
to
have
a
grate
and
oven
add
to
his
convenience
:
he
love
the
old
brick
hearth
as
he
have
love
his
brown
pot
 
and
be
it
not
there
when
he
have
find
Eppie
?
 
<EOS>
the
god
of
the
hearth
exist
for
us
still
;
and
let
all
new
faith
be
tolerant
of
that
fetishism
,
lest
it
bruise
its
own
root
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
eat
his
dinner
more
silently
than
usual
,
soon
lay
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
watch
half
-
abstractedly
Eppie
's
play
with
Snap
and
the
cat
,
by
which
her
own
dining
be
make
rather
a
lengthy
business
.
 
<EOS>
yet
it
be
a
sight
that
may
well
arrest
wander
thought
:
Eppie
,
with
the
ripple
radiance
of
her
hair
and
the
whiteness
of
her
rounded
chin
and
throat
set
off
by
the
dark
-
blue
cotton
gown
,
laugh
merrily
as
the
kitten
hold
on
with
her
four
claws
to
one
shoulder
,
like
a
design
for
a
jug
-
handle
,
while
Snap
on
the
right
hand
and
Puss
on
the
other
put
up
their
paw
towards
a
morsel
which
she
hold
out
of
the
reach
of
both
 
Snap
occasionally
desist
in
order
to
remonstrate
with
the
cat
by
a
cogent
worry
growl
on
the
greediness
and
futility
of
her
conduct
;
till
Eppie
relent
,
caress
them
both
,
and
divide
the
morsel
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
last
Eppie
,
glance
at
the
clock
,
check
the
play
,
and
say
,
"
o
daddy
,
you
be
want
to
go
into
the
sunshine
to
smoke
your
pipe
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
clear
away
first
,
so
as
the
house
may
be
tidy
when
godmother
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
haste
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
have
take
to
smoke
a
pipe
daily
during
the
last
two
year
,
have
be
strongly
urge
to
it
by
the
sage
of
Raveloe
,
as
a
practice
"
good
for
the
fit
"
;
and
this
advice
be
sanction
by
Dr.
Kimble
,
on
the
ground
that
it
be
as
well
to
try
what
could
do
no
harm
 
a
principle
which
be
make
to
answer
for
a
great
deal
of
work
in
that
gentleman
's
medical
practice
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
do
not
highly
enjoy
smoke
,
and
often
wonder
how
his
neighbour
could
be
so
fond
of
it
;
but
a
humble
sort
of
acquiescence
in
what
be
hold
to
be
good
,
have
become
a
strong
habit
of
that
new
self
which
have
be
develop
in
him
since
he
have
find
Eppie
on
his
hearth
:
it
have
be
the
only
clew
his
bewilder
mind
could
hold
by
in
cherish
this
young
life
that
have
be
send
to
him
out
of
the
darkness
into
which
his
gold
have
depart
.
 
<EOS>
by
seek
what
be
needful
for
Eppie
,
by
share
the
effect
that
everything
produce
on
her
,
he
have
himself
come
to
appropriate
the
form
of
custom
and
belief
which
be
the
mould
of
Raveloe
life
;
and
as
,
with
reawaken
sensibility
,
memory
also
reawaken
,
he
have
begin
to
ponder
over
the
element
of
his
old
faith
,
and
blend
them
with
his
new
impression
,
till
he
recover
a
consciousness
of
unity
between
his
past
and
present
.
<EOS>
the
sense
of
preside
goodness
and
the
human
trust
which
come
with
all
pure
peace
and
joy
,
have
give
him
a
dim
impression
that
there
have
be
some
error
,
some
mistake
,
which
have
throw
that
dark
shadow
over
the
day
of
his
good
year
;
and
as
it
grow
more
and
more
easy
to
him
to
open
his
mind
to
Dolly
Winthrop
,
he
gradually
communicate
to
her
all
he
could
describe
of
his
early
life
.
 
<EOS>
the
communication
be
necessarily
a
slow
and
difficult
process
,
for
Silas
's
meagre
power
of
explanation
be
not
aid
by
any
readiness
of
interpretation
in
Dolly
,
whose
narrow
outward
experience
give
her
no
key
to
strange
custom
,
and
make
every
novelty
a
source
of
wonder
that
arrest
them
at
every
step
of
the
narrative
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
by
fragment
,
and
at
interval
which
leave
Dolly
time
to
revolve
what
she
have
hear
till
it
acquire
some
familiarity
for
her
,
that
Silas
at
last
arrive
at
the
climax
of
the
sad
story
 
the
drawing
of
lot
,
and
its
false
testimony
concern
him
;
and
this
have
to
be
repeat
in
several
interview
,
under
new
question
on
her
part
as
to
the
nature
of
this
plan
for
detect
the
guilty
and
clear
the
innocent
.

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

Silas

he
add
in

low
tone

<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear

"
say
Dolly
in
a
grieve
voice
,
as
if
she
be

report
of
a
sick
man

case

<EOS>
She
be
silent
for
some
minute

at

she

"
there

I

such
as
poor

not

much
out

<EOS>
I
can
never

the
meaning
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
what
I
hear
at

only
a
bit
here

there

I

,
if

by

They
would
never

let
you
be
turn
out
for

you
be
innicent

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
 
<EOS>
say
Silas
,
who
have
now
come
to
understand
Dolly
's
phraseology
,
"
that
be
what
fall
on
me
like
as
if
it
have
be
red

there
be
nobody
as

and
him
as
I
would
go
out

in

for
ten

and
more
,
since
when
we
be

go
half
 
mine

lift
up

un
 
<EOS>
I
can
not

say
Dolly

"
but
I
be
o'ercome

Master

I
be
like
as
if
I
would
wake

do
not

whether
it

night

I
feel
somehow
as
sure
as
I
do
when
I
have
lay
something
up
though
I
can
not
justly
put
my
hand
on
it

as
there
be
a
right
in
what
happen
to
you

if
one
could
but
make
it
out
;
and
you
would
no
call
to
lose
heart
as
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
will
talk
on
it
again
;
for
sometimes
thing
come
into
my
head
when
I
be
leech
or
poultice
,
or
such
,
as
I
could
never
think
on
when
I
be
sit
still

<EOS>
Dolly
be
too
useful
a
woman
not
to
have
many
opportunity
of
illumination
of
the
kind
she
allude
to
,
and
she
be
not
long
before
she
recur
to
the
subject

<EOS>
"
Master
Marner
,
"
she
say
,
one
day
that
she
come
to
bring
home
Eppie

"
I
have
be
sore
puzzle
for
a
good
bit
wi

<EOS>
that
trouble

o

the

it

back'ards
and
for'ards
,
as
I
do
not
know
<EOS>
which
end
to
lay
hold
on
.
<EOS>
but
it
come
to
me
all
clear
like
,
that
night
when
I
be
sit
up
wi
'
poor
bessy
fawke
,
as
be
dead
and
leave
her
child
behind
<EOS>
,
God
help
'em
 
<EOS>
it
come
to
me
as
clear
as
daylight
;
but
whether
I
have
get
hold
on
it
now
,
or
can
anyways
bring
it
to
my
tongue
's
end
,
that
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
often
a
deal
inside
me
as'll
never
come
out
;
and
for
what
you
talk
<EOS>
o
'
your
folk
in
your
old
country
niver
say
prayer
by
heart
nor
say
'em
out
of
a
book
<EOS>
,
they
must
be
wonderful
cliver
;
for
if
I
do
not
know
"
Our

"
,
and
little
bit
o
'
good
word
as
I
can
carry
out
o
'
church
wi
'
me
,
I
may
down
o
'
my
knee
every
night
,
but
nothing
could
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
can
mostly
say
something
as
I
can
make
sense
on
,
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
"
say
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
Master
Marner
,
it
come
to
me
summat
like
this
:
I
can
make
nothing
<EOS>
o
'
the
drawing
o
'
lot
and
the
answer
come
wrong
;
it
'
ud
mayhap
take
the
parson
to
tell
that
,
and
he
could
only
tell
us
i
'
big
word
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
come
to
me
as
clear
as
the
daylight
,
it
be
when
I
be
trouble
over
poor
Bessy
Fawkes
,
and
it
allay
come
into
my
head
when
I
be
sorry
for
folk
,
and
feel
as
I
can
not
do
a
power
to
help
'em
,
not
if
I
be
to
get
up
<EOS>
i
'
the
middle
o
'
<EOS>
the
night
 
<EOS>
it
come
into
my
head
as
Them
above
<EOS>
have
get
a
deal
tenderer
heart
nor
<EOS>
what
I
have
get
 
for
I
can
not
be
anyways
well
nor
Them
as
make
me
;
and
if
anything
look
hard
to
me
,
it
be
because
there
be
thing
I
do
not
know
on
;
and
for
the
matter
o
<EOS>
'
that
,
there
may
be
plenty
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
thing
I
do
not

on

<EOS>
for
it
be
little
as
I
know
 
that
it
be
.
<EOS>
and
so
,
while
I
be
think
o
'
that
,
you
come
into
my
mind
,
Master
Marner
,
and
it
all
come
pour
in
:
 
if
_
<EOS>
I
_
feel
<EOS>
i

<EOS>
my
inside
<EOS>
what
be
the
right
and
just
thing
by
you
,
and
them
as
pray

draw
the

<EOS>
all
but
that
wicked
un

if

by

if
they
could

be

there
Them
as
be
at

making
on

know
well
and
have
a
well

<EOS>
and
that
be
all
as
ever
<EOS>
I
can
be
sure
on
,
and
everything
else
be
a
big
puzzle
to
me
when
I
think
on

for
there
be
the
fever
come

take
off
them
as
be
full

growed

leave
the
helpless
child

and
there
be
the
breaking

them
as

do
right

have
to
suffer

there
be
trouble

i

there
be
thing
as
we
can
niver
make
out

and
all
as
we
have
get
to
do
be
to

to

the

I

.
 
<EOS>
now
that
she
be
grow
up
,
Silas
have
often
be
lead
,
in
those
moment
of
quiet
outpouring
which
come
to
people
who
live
together
in
perfect
love
,
to
talk
with
_
<EOS>
her
_
<EOS>
too
of
the
past
,
and
how
and
why
he
have
live
a
lonely
man
until
she
have
be
send
to
him
.
<EOS>
for
it
would
have
be
impossible
for
him
to
hide
from
Eppie
that
she
be
not
his
own
child
:
even
if
the
most
delicate
reticence
on
the
point
could
have
be
expect
from
Raveloe
gossip
in
her
presence
,
her
own
question
about
her
mother
could
not
have
be
parry
,
as
she
grow
up
,
without
that
complete
shrouding
of
the
past
which
would
have
make
a
painful
barrier
between
their
mind
.
<EOS>
so
Eppie
have
long
know
how
her
mother
have
die
on
the
snowy
ground
,
and
how
she
herself
have
be
find
on
the
hearth
by
father
Silas
,
who
have
take
her
golden
curl
for
his
lose
guinea
bring
back
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
tender
and
peculiar
love
with
which
Silas
have
rear
her
in
almost
inseparable
companionship
with
himself
,
aid
by
the
seclusion
of
their
dwelling
,
have
preserve
her
from
the
lower
influence
of
the
village
talk
and
habit
,
and
have
keep
her
mind
in
that
freshness
which
be
sometimes
falsely
suppose
to
be
an
invariable
attribute
of
rusticity
.
 
<EOS>
perfect
love
have
a
breath
of
poetry
which
can
exalt
the
relation
of
the
least
-
instruct
human
being
;
and
this
breath
of
poetry
have
surround
Eppie
from
the
time
when
she
have
follow
the
bright
gleam
that
beckon
her
to
Silas
's
hearth
;
so
that
it
be
not
surprising
if
,
in
other
thing
besides
her
delicate
prettiness
,
she
be
not
quite
a
common
village
maiden
,
but
have
a
touch
of
refinement
and
fervour
which
come
from
no
other
teaching
than
that
of
tenderly
-
nurture
unvitiated
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
too
childish
and
simple
for
her
imagination
to
rove
into
question
about
her
unknown
father
;
for
a
long
while
it
do
not
even
occur
to
her
that
she
must
have
have
a
father
;
and
the
first
time
that
the
idea
of
her
mother
have
have
a
husband
present
itself
to
her
,
be
when
Silas
show
her
the
wedding
-
ring
which
have
be
take
from
the
waste
finger
,
and
have
be
carefully
preserve
by
him
in
a
little
lackered
box
shape
like
a
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
He
deliver
this
box
into
Eppie
's
charge
when
she
have
grow
up
,
and
she
often
open
it
to
look
at
the
ring
:
but
still
she
think
hardly
at
all
about
the
father
of
whom
it
be
the
symbol
.
 
<EOS>
have
she
not
a
father
very
close
to
her
,
who
love
her
better
than
any
real
father
in
the
village
seem
to
love
their
daughter
?
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
who
her
mother
be
,
and
how
she
come
to
die
in
that
forlornness
,
be
question
that
often
press
on
Eppie
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Her
knowledge
of
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
who
be
her
near
friend
next
to
Silas
,
make
her
feel
that
a
mother
must
be
very
precious
;
and
she
have
again
and
again
ask
Silas
to
tell
her
how
her
mother
look
,
whom
she
be
like
,
and
how
he
have
find
her
against
the
furze
bush
,
lead
towards
it
by
the
little
footstep
and
the
outstretche
arm
.
 
<EOS>
the
furze
bush
be
there
still
;
and
this
afternoon
,
when
Eppie
come
out
with
Silas
into
the
sunshine
,
it
be
the
first
object
that
arrest
her
eye
and
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
she
say
,
in
a
tone
of
gentle
gravity
,
which
sometimes
come
like
a
sadder
,
slow
cadence
across
her
playfulness
,
"
we
shall
take
the
furze
bush
into
the
garden
;
it
will
come
into
the
corner
,
and
just
against
it
I
will
put
snowdrop
and
crocus
,
because
Aaron
say
they
will
not
die
out
,
but'll
always
get
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
child
,
"
say
Silas
,
always
ready
to
talk
when
he
have
his
pipe
in
his
hand
,
apparently
enjoy
the
pause
more
than
the
puff
,
"
it
would
not
do
to
leave
out
the
furze
bush
;
and
there
be
nothing
pretty
,
to
my
thinking
,
when
it
be
yallow
with
flower
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
just
come
into
my
head
what
we
be
to
do
for
a
fence
 
<EOS>
mayhap
Aaron
can
help
us
to
a
thought
;
but
a
fence
we
must
have
,
else
the
donkey
and
thing
'
ull
come
and
trample
everything
down
.
 
<EOS>
and
fence
be
hard
to
be
get
at
,
by
what
I
can
make
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
will
tell
you
,
daddy
,
"
say
Eppie
,
clasp
her
hand
suddenly
,
after
a
minute
's
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
<EOS>
lot
o
'
loose
stone
about
,
some
of
'em
not
big
,
<EOS>
and
we
may
lay
'em
atop
of
one
another
,
and
make
a
wall

<EOS>
You
and
me
could
carry
the
small

Aaron

carry
the
rest

I
know
he
would

"
  
<EOS>
"
eh
,
my
precious
un

"
say
Silas
,
"
there
be
not
enough
stone
to
go
all
round

as
for
you

why
,
wi

your
little

you
could
not

no

<EOS>
You

my

he
add
,
with
a
tender
intonation
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
Mrs.
Winthrop
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
be
strong
than
you
think
,
daddy

Eppie
;

if
there

stone
enough
to
go
all
round
,
why
they
will
go
<EOS>
part
o

the
way

<EOS>
and
then
it
will
be
easy
to
get
stick
and

for
the
rest

<EOS>
see
here
,
round
the
big
pit
,
what

<EOS>
She
skip
forward
to
the
pit
,
mean
to
lift
one
of
the
stone
and
exhibit
her
strength
,
but
she
start
back
in
surprise

away

sentence
slowly

more
than

Eppie
,
when
they

down
on

nestle
close

take
hold
caressingly
of

hold
it
on

puff
again
dutifully
at

occupy
his

an
ash
in

happy

shadow
all
about

"

very
gently

in

Silas
give
an
almost
imperceptible
start
,
though
the
question
fall
in
with
the
under
-
current
of
thought
in
his
own
mind
,
and
then
say
,
in
a
subdued
tone

slight

the

not

you

parting
injunction

shake
them
gently

by
way

friendly
incitement

Speckle

<EOS>
"
I
shall
just
take
a
turn
to
the
field
against
the
Stone

pit

Nancy

look
at
the
draining

Godfrey

"
You

I

<EOS>
It
be
Godfrey
's
custom
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
to
do
a
little
contemplative
farming
in
a
leisurely
walk
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
seldom
accompany
him
;
for
the
woman
of
her
generation
 
unless
,
like
Priscilla
,
they
take
to
outdoor
management
 
be
not
give
to
much
walk
beyond
their
own
house
and
garden
,
find
sufficient
exercise
in
domestic
duty
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
when
Priscilla
be
not
with
her
,
she
usually
sit
with
Mant
's
Bible
before
her
,
and
after
follow
the
text
with
her
eye
for
a
little
while
,
she
would
gradually
permit
them
to
wander
as
her
thought
have
already
insist
on
wander
.
  
<EOS>
but
Nancy
's
Sunday
thought
be
rarely
quite
out
of
keep
with
the
devout
and
reverential
intention
imply
by
the
book
<EOS>
spread
open
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
theologically
instruct
enough
to
discern
very
clearly
the
relation
between
the
sacred
document
of
the
past
which
she
open
without
method
,
and
her
own
obscure
,
simple
life
;
but
the
spirit
of
rectitude
,
and
the
sense
of
responsibility
for
the
effect
of
her
conduct
on
other
,
which
be
strong
element
in
Nancy
's
character
,
have
make
it
a
habit
with
her
to
scrutinize
her
past
feeling
and
action
with
self
-
question
solicitude
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mind
not
be
court
by
a
great
variety
of
subject
,
she
fill
the
vacant
moment
by
live
inwardly
,
again
and
again
,
through
all
her
remembered
experience
,
especially
through
the
fifteen
year
of
her
married
time
,
in
which
her
life
and
its
significance
have
be
double
.
 
<EOS>
She
recall
the
small
detail
,
the
word
,
tone
,
and
look
,
in
the
critical
scene
which
have
open
a
new
epoch
for
her
by
give
her
a
deep
insight
into
the
relation
and
trial
of
life
,
or
which
have
call
on
her
for
some
little
effort
of
forbearance
,
or
of
painful
adherence
to
an
imagined
or
real
duty
 
ask
herself
continually
whether
she
have
be
in
any
respect
blamable
.
 
<EOS>
this
excessive
rumination
and
self
-
questioning
be
perhaps
a
morbid
habit
inevitable
to
a
mind
of
much
moral
sensibility
when
shut
out
from
its
due
share
of
outward
activity
and
of
practical
claim
on
its
affection
 
inevitable
to
a
noble
-
hearted
,
childless
woman
,
when
her
lot
be
narrow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
so
little
 
<EOS>
have
I
do
it
all
well
?
<EOS>
"
 
be
the
perpetually
recur
think
;
and
there
be
no
voice
call
her
away
from
that
soliloquy
,
no
peremptory
demand
to
divert
energy
from
vain
regret
or
superfluous
scruple
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
main
thread
of
painful
experience
in
Nancy
's
marry
life
,
and
on
it
hang
certain
deeply
-
feel
scene
,
which
be
the
oftenest
revive
in
retrospect
.
 
<EOS>
the
short
dialogue
with
Priscilla
in
the
garden
have
determine
the
current
of
retrospect
in
that
frequent
direction
this
particular
Sunday
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
wandering
of
her
thought
from
the
text
,
which
she
still
attempt
dutifully
to
follow
with
her
eye
and
silent
lip
,
be
into
an
imaginary
enlargement
of
the
defence
she
have
set
up
for
her
husband
against
Priscilla
's
imply
blame
.
 
<EOS>
the
vindication
of
the
loved
object
be
the
good
balm
affection
can
find
for
its
wound
:
 
<EOS>
"
a
man
must
have
so
much
on
his
mind
,
"
be
the
belief
by
which
a
wife
often
support
a
cheerful
face
under
rough
answer
and
unfeele
word
.
 
<EOS>
and
Nancy
's
deep
wound
have
all
come
from
the
perception
that
the
absence
of
child
from
their
hearth
be
dwell
on
in
her
husband
's
mind
as
a
privation
to
which
he
could
not
reconcile
himself
.
  
<EOS>
yet
sweet
Nancy
may
have
be
expect
to
feel
still
more
keenly
the
denial
of
a
blessing
to
which
she
have
look
forward
with
all
the
varied
expectation
and
preparation
,
solemn
and
prettily
trivial
,
which
fill
the
mind
of
a
loving
woman
when
she
expect
to
become
a
mother
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
not
a
drawer
fill
with
the
neat
work
of
her
hand
,
all
unworn
and
untouched
,
just
as
she
have
arrange
it
there
fourteen
year
ago
 
just
,
but
for
one
little
dress
,
which
have
be
make
the
burial
-
dress
?
 
<EOS>
but
under
this
immediate
personal
trial
Nancy
be
so
firmly
unmurmuring
,
<EOS>
that
year
ago
she
have
suddenly
renounce
the
habit
of
visit
this
drawer
,
lest
she
should
in
this
way
be
cherish
a
longing
for
what
be
not
give
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
this
very
severity
towards
any
indulgence
of
what
she
hold
to
be
sinful
regret
in
herself
,
that
make
her
shrink
from
apply
her
own
standard
to
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
different
 
<EOS>
it
be
much
bad
for
a
man
to
be
disappoint
in
that
way
:
a
woman
can
always
be
satisfied
with
devote
herself
to
her
husband
,
but
a
man
want
something
that
will
make
him
look
forward
more
 
and
sit
by
the
fire
be
so
much
duller
to
him
than
to
a
woman
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
always
,
when
Nancy
reach
this
point
in
her
meditation
 
try
,
with
predetermine
sympathy
,
to
see
everything
as
Godfrey
see
it
 
there
come
a
renewal
of
self
-
questioning
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
have
_
<EOS>
she
do
everything
in
her
power
to
lighten
Godfrey
's
privation
?
 
<EOS>
have
she
really
be
right
in
the
resistance
which
have
cost
her
so
much
pain
six
year
ago
,
and
<EOS>
again
four
year
ago
 
the
resistance
to
her
husband
's
wish
that
they
should
adopt
a
child
?
<EOS>
adoption
be
more
remote
from
the
idea
and
habit
of
that
time
than
of
our
own
;
still
Nancy
have
her
opinion
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
necessary
to
her
mind
to
have
an
opinion
on
all
topic
,
not
exclusively
masculine
,
that
have
come
under
her
notice
,
as
for
her
to
have
a
precisely
mark
place
for
every
article
of
her
personal
property
:
and
her
opinion
be
always
principle
to
be
unwaveringly
act
on
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
firm
,
not
because
of
their
basis
,
but
because
she
hold
them
with
a
tenacity
inseparable
from
her
mental
action
.
 
<EOS>
on
all
the
duty
and
propriety
of
life
,
from
filial
behaviour
to
the
arrangement
of
the
evening
toilette
,
pretty
Nancy
Lammeter
,
by
the
time
she
be
three
-
and
-
twenty
,
have
her
unalterable
little
code
,
and
have
form
every
one
of
her
habit
in
strict
accordance
with
that
code
.
 
<EOS>
She
carry
these
decide
judgment
within
her
in
the
most
unobtrusive
way
:
they
root
themselves
in
her
mind
,
and
grow
there
as
quietly
as
grass
.
 
<EOS>
year
ago
,
we
know
,
she
insist
on
dress
like
Priscilla
,
because
"
it
be
right
for
sister
to
dress
alike
"
,
and
because
"
she
would
do
what
be
right
<EOS>
if
she
wear
a
gown
dye
with
cheese
-
colour
"
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
trivial
but
typical
instance
of
the
mode
in
which
Nancy
's
life
be
regulate
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
rigid
principle
,
and
no
petty
egoistic
feeling
,
which
have
be
the
ground
of
Nancy
's
difficult
resistance
to
her
husband
's
wish
.
 
<EOS>
to
adopt
a
child
,
because
child
of
your
own
have
be
deny
you
,
be
to
try
and
choose
your
lot
in
spite
of
Providence
:
the
adopt
child
,
she
be
convince
,
would
never
turn
out
well
,
and
would
be
a
curse
to
those
who
have
wilfully
and
rebelliously
seek
what
it
be
clear
that
,
for
some
high
reason
,
they
be
well
without
.
<EOS>
when
you
see
a
thing
be
not
mean
to
be
,
say
Nancy
,
it
be
a
bounden
duty
to
leave
off
so
much
as
wish
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
far
,
perhaps
,
the
wise
of
man
could
scarcely
make
more
than
a
verbal
improvement
in
her
principle
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
condition
under
which
she
hold
it
apparent
that
a
thing
be
not
mean
to
be
,
depend
on
a
more
peculiar
mode
of
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
give
up
make
a
purchase
at
a
particular
place
if
,
on
three
successive
time
,
rain
,
or
some
other
cause
of
Heaven
's
sending
,
have
form
an
obstacle
;
and
she
would
have
anticipate
a
broken
limb
or
other
heavy
misfortune
to
any
one
who
persist
in
spite
of
such
indication
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
should
you
think
the
child
would
turn
out
ill
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
Godfrey
,
in
his
remonstrance
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
have
thrive
as
well
as
child
can
do
with
the
weaver
;
and
_
<EOS>
he
_
adopt
her
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
such
a
pretty
little
girl
anywhere
else
in
the
parish
,
or
one
fitter
for
the
station
we
could
give
her
.
 
<EOS>
where
can
be
the
likelihood
of
her
be
a
curse
to
anybody
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
Godfrey
,
"
say
Nancy
,
who
be
sit
with
her
hand
tightly
clasp
together
,
and
with
yearning
,
regretful
affection
in
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
child
may
not
turn
out
ill
with
the
weaver
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
then
,
he
do
not
go
to
seek
her
,
as
we
should
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
wrong
:
I
feel
sure
it
will
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
what
that
lady
we
meet
at
the
Royston
Baths
tell
us
about
the
child
her
sister
adopt
?
<EOS>
that
be
the
only
adopt
I
ever
hear
of
:
and
the
child
be
transport
when
it
be
twenty
-
three
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Godfrey
,
do
not
ask
me
to
do
what
I
know
be
wrong
:
I
should
never
be
happy
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
very
hard
for
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
it
be
easy
for
me
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
will
of
Providence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
seem
singular
that
Nancy
 
with
her
religious
theory
piece
together
out
of
narrow
social
tradition
,
fragment
of
church
doctrine
imperfectly
understand
,
and
girlish
reasoning
on
her
small
experience
 
should
have
arrive
by
herself
at
a
way
of
thinking
so
nearly
akin
to
that
of
many
devout
people
,
whose
belief
be
hold
in
the
shape
of
a
system
quite
remote
from
her
knowledge
 
<EOS>
singular
,
if
we
do
not
know
that
human
belief
,
like
all
other
natural
growth
,
elude
the
barrier
of
system
.
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
have
from
the
first
specify
Eppie
,
then
about
twelve
year
old
,
as
a
child
suitable
for
them
to
adopt
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
never
occur
to
him
that
Silas
would
rather
part
with
his
life
than
with
Eppie
.
<EOS>
surely
the
weaver
would
wish
the
good
to
the
child
he
have
take
so
much
trouble
with
,
and
would
be
glad
that
such
good
fortune
should
happen
to
her
:
she
would
always
be
very
grateful
to
him
,
and
he
would
be
well
provide
for
to
the
end
of
his
life
 
provide
for
as
the
excellent
part
he
have
do
by
the
child
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
an
appropriate
thing
for
people
in
a
high
station
to
take
a
charge
off
the
hand
of
a
man
in
a
low
?
 
<EOS>
It
seem
an
eminently
appropriate
thing
to
Godfrey
,
for
reason
that
be
know
only
to
himself
;
and
by
a
common
fallacy
,
he
imagine
the
measure
would
be
easy
because
he
have
private
motive
for
desire
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
rather
a
coarse
mode
of
estimate
Silas
's
relation
to
Eppie
;
but
we
must
remember
that
many
of
the
impression
which
Godfrey
be
likely
to
gather
concern
the
labour
people
around
him
would
favour
the
idea
that
deep
affection
can
hardly
go
along
with
callous
palm
and
scant
mean
;
and
he
have
not
have
the
opportunity
,
even
if
he
have
have
the
power
,
of
enter
intimately
into
all
that
be
exceptional
in
the
weaver
's
experience
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
the
want
of
adequate
knowledge
that
could
have
make
it
possible
for
Godfrey
deliberately
to
entertain
an
unfeeling
project
:
his
natural
kindness
have
outlive
that
blight
time
of
cruel
wish
,
and
Nancy
's
praise
of
him
as
a
husband
be
not
found
entirely
on
a
wilful
illusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
right
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
when
she
have
recall
all
their
scene
of
discussion
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
I
be
right
to
say
him
nay
,
though
it
hurt
me
more
than
anything
;
but
how
good
Godfrey
have
be
about
it
!
<EOS>
many
man
would
have
be
very
angry
with
me
for
stand
out
against
their
wish
;
and
they
may
have
throw
out
that
they
would
have
ill
-
luck
in
marry
me
;
but
Godfrey
have
never
be
the
man
to
say
me
an
unkind
word
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
what
he
can
not
hide
:
everything
seem
so
blank
to
him
,
I
know
;
and
the
land
 
<EOS>
what
a
difference
<EOS>
it
'
ud
make
to
him
,
when
he
go
to
see
after
thing
,
if
he
would
child
grow
up
that
he
be
do
it
all
for
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
murmur
;
and
perhaps
if
he
would
marry
a
woman
who
'd
have
have
child
,
she
would
have
vex
him
in
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
possibility
be
Nancy
's
chief
comfort
;
and
to
give
it
great
strength
,
she
labour
to
make
it
impossible
that
any
other
wife
should
have
have
more
perfect
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
_
force
_
to
vex
him
by
that
one
denial
.
 
<EOS>
Godfrey
be
not
insensible
to
her
loving
effort
,
and
do
Nancy
no
injustice
as
to
the
motive
of
her
obstinacy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
have
live
with
her
fifteen
year
and
not
be
aware
that
an
unselfish
cling
to
the
right
,
and
a
sincerity
clear
as
the
flower
-
bear
dew
,
be
her
main
characteristic
;
indeed
,
Godfrey
feel
this
so
strongly
,
that
his
own
more
wavering
nature
,
too
averse
to
face
difficulty
to
be
unvaryingly
simple
and
truthful
,
be
keep
in
a
certain
awe
of
this
gentle
wife
who
watch
his
look
with
a
yearning
to
obey
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
impossible
that
he
should
ever
confess
to
her
the
truth
about
Eppie
:
she
would
never
recover
from
the
repulsion
the
story
of
his
early
marriage
would
create
,
tell
to
her
now
,
after
that
long
concealment
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
child
,
too
,
he
think
,
must
become
an
object
of
repulsion
:
the
very
sight
of
her
would
be
painful
.
<EOS>
the
shock
to
Nancy
's
mingled
pride
and
ignorance
of
the
world
's
evil
may
even
be
too
much
for
her
delicate
frame
.
 
<EOS>
since
he
have
marry
her
with
that
secret
on
his
heart
,
he
must
keep
it
there
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
whatever
else
he
do
,
he
could
not
make
an
irreparable
breach
between
himself
and
this
long
-
love
wife
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
why
could
he
not
make
up
his
mind
to
the
absence
of
child
from
a
hearth
brighten
by
such
a
wife
?
 
<EOS>
why
do
his
mind
fly
uneasily
to
that
void
,
as
if
it
be
the
sole
reason
why
life
be
not
thoroughly
joyous
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
the
way
with
all
man
and
woman
who
reach
middle
age
without
the
clear
perception
that
life
never
_
can
_
be
thoroughly
joyous
:
under
the
vague
dullness
of
the
grey
hour
,
dissatisfaction
seek
a
definite
object
,
and
find
it
in
the
privation
of
an
untried
good
.
 
<EOS>
dissatisfaction
seat
musingly
on
a
childless
hearth
,
think
with
envy
of
the
father
whose
return
be
greet
by
young
voice
 
seat
at
the
meal
where
the
little
head
rise
one
above
another
like
nursery
plant
,
it
see
a
black
care
hover
behind
every
one
of
them
,
and
think
the
impulse
by
which
man
abandon
freedom
,
and
seek
for
tie
,
be
surely
nothing
but
a
brief
madness
.
 
<EOS>
in
Godfrey
's
case
there
be
further
reason
why
his
thought
should
be
continually
solicit
by
this
one
point
in
his
lot
:
<EOS>
his
conscience
,
never
thoroughly
easy
about
Eppie
,
now
give
his
childless
home
the
aspect
of
a
retribution
;
and
as
the
time
pass
on
,
under
Nancy
's
refusal
to
adopt
her
,
any
retrieval
of
his
error
become
more
and
more
difficult
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
Sunday
afternoon
it
be
already
four
year
since
there
have
be
any
allusion
to
the
subject
between
them
,
and
Nancy
suppose
that
it
be
for
ever
bury
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
he
will
mind
it
less
or
more
as
he
get
old
<EOS>
,
"
she
think
;
"
I
be
afraid
more
.
 
<EOS>
aged
people
feel
the
miss
of
child
:
what
would
father
do
without
Priscilla
?
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
die
,
Godfrey
will
be
very
lonely
 
not
hold
together
with
his
brother
much
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
be
over
-
anxious
,
and
try
to
make
thing
out
beforehand
:
I
must
do
my
good
for
the
present
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
last
think
Nancy
rouse
herself
from
her
reverie
,
and
turn
her
eye
again
towards
the
forsaken
page
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
forsake
longer
than
she
imagine
,
for
she
be
presently
surprise
by
the
appearance
of
the
servant
with
the
tea
-
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
in
fact
,
a
little
before
the
usual
time
for
tea
;
but
Jane
have
her
reason
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
your
master
come
into
the
yard
,
Jane
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
'
m
,
he
be
not
,
"
say
Jane
,
with
a
slight
emphasis
,
of
which
,
however
,
her
mistress
take
no
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
you
have
see
'em
,
'

"
continue
Jane
,
after
a
pause
,
"
but
there
be
folk
make
haste
all
one
way
,
afore
the
front
window
.

I
doubt
something
be
happen

there
be
niver
a

the

I
would
send

I
have
be
up
into
the
top
attic
,
but
there
be
no
see
anything
for
tree
.

I
hope
nobody
be
hurt
,
that
be
all

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
I
daresay
there
be
nothing
much
the
matter
,
"
say
Nancy
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
perhaps
Mr.
Snell
's
bull
get
out
again
,
as
he
do
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
may
not
gore
anybody
then
<EOS>
,
that
be
all
,
"
say
Jane
,
not
altogether
despise
a
hypothesis
which
cover
a
few
imaginary
calamity
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
girl
be
always
terrify
me
,
"
think
Nancy
;
"
I
wish
Godfrey
would
come
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
go
to
the
front
window
and
look
as
far
as
she
could
see
along
the
road
,
with
an
uneasiness
which
she
feel
to
be
childish
,
for
there
be
now
no
such
sign
of
excitement
as
Jane
have
speak
of
,
and
Godfrey
would
not
be
likely
to
return
by
the
village
road
,
but
<EOS>
by
the
field
.
<EOS>
She
continue
to
stand
,
however
,
look
at
the
placid
churchyard
with
the
long
shadow
of
the
gravestone
across
the
bright
green
hillock
,
and
at
the
glowing
autumn
colour
of
the
Rectory
tree
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
before
such
calm
external
beauty
the
presence
of
a
vague
fear
be
more
distinctly
feel
 
like
a
raven
flap
its
slow
wing
across
the
sunny
air
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
wish
more
and
more
that
Godfrey
would
come
in
.
    
<EOS>
some
one
open
the
door
at
the
other

She

She

for
Godfrey

lay
down
his
hat
with
tremble
hand
,
and
turn
towards
her
with
a
pale
face
and
a
strange
unanswering
glance
,
as
if
he
see
her
indeed
,
but
see
her
as
part
of
a
scene
invisible
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
lay
her
hand
on
his
arm
,
not
daring
to
speak
again
;
but
he
leave
the
touch
unnoticed
,
and
throw
himself
into
his
chair

<EOS>
Jane

already
at
the

with
the
hiss
urn

<EOS>
"
tell
her

will
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
Godfrey
;
and
when
the
door
be
close
again
he
exert
himself
to
speak
more
distinctly
.
  
<EOS>
"
sit
down
,
Nancy
 
there
,
"
he
say
,
point
to
a
chair
opposite
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
come
back
as
soon
as
I
could
,
to
hinder
anybody

tell
you
but
me

<EOS>
I
have
have
a
great
shock
 
<EOS>
but
I
care
most
about
the
shock
it
will
be
to
you

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
father
and
Priscilla

"
 
<EOS>
say
Nancy
,
with
quivering
lip
,
clasp
her
hand
together
tightly
on
her
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
be
nobody

"
say
Godfrey
,
unequal
to
the
considerate
skill
with
which
he
would
have
wish
to
make
his
revelation
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
dunstan

We

"
  
<EOS>
the
deep
dread
Godfrey
's
look
have
create
in
Nancy
make
her
feel
these
word
a
relief
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
in
comparative
calmness
to
hear
what
else
he
have
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
on
:
  
<EOS>
"
The
Stone
-
pit
have
go
dry
suddenly
 
from
the
draining
,
I
suppose
;
and
there
he
lie
 
<EOS>
have
lain
for
sixteen
year
,
wedge
between
two
great
stone
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
his
watch
and
seal
,
and
there
be
my
gold
-
handle
hunting
-
whip
,
with
my
name
on
<EOS>
:
he
take
it
away
,
without
my
knowing
,
the
day
he
go
hunt
on
Wildfire
,
the
last
time
he
be

.
"
  
<EOS>
Godfrey
pause
:
<EOS>
it
be
not
so
easy
to
say
what
come
next
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
he
drown
himself
?
"
 
<EOS>
say
Nancy
,
almost
wonder
that
her
husband
should
be
so
deeply
shake
by
what
have
happen
all
those
year
ago
to
an
unloved
brother
,
of
whom
bad
thing
have
be
augur
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
he
fall
in
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
,
as
if
he
feel
some
deep
meaning
in
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
presently
he
add
:
"
Dunstan
be
the
man
that
rob
Silas
Marner
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
blood
rush
to
Nancy
's
face
and
neck
at
this
surprise
and
shame
,
for
she
have
be
breed
up
to
regard
even
a
distant
kinship
with
crime
as
a
dishonour
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
Godfrey
!
"
 
<EOS>
she
say
,
with
compassion
in
her
tone
,
for
she
have
immediately
reflect
that
the
dishonour
must
be
feel
still
more
keenly
by
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
the
money
in
the
pit
,
"
he
continue
 
"
all
the
weaver
's
money

<EOS>
Everything
be
be
gather
up
,
and
they
be
take
the

to
the
Rainbow

<EOS>
but
I
come
back
to
tell
you
:
<EOS>
there
be
no
hinder
it
;
you
must
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
silent
,
look
on
the
ground
for
two
long
minute
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
would
have
say
some
word
of
comfort
under
this
disgrace
,
but
she
refrain
,
from
an
instinctive
sense
that
there
be
something
behind
 
that
Godfrey
have
something
else
to
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
presently
he
lift
his
eye
to
her
face
,
and
keep
them
fix
on
her
,
as
he
say
    
"
everything
come
to
light
,
Nancy
,
sooner
or
later
.
 
<EOS>
when
God
Almighty
will
it
,
our
secret
be
find
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
live
with
a
secret
on
my
mind
,
but
I
will
keep
it
from
you
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
know
it
by
somebody
else
,
and
not
by
me
 
I
would
not
have
you
find
it
out
after
I
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
be
"
I
will
"
and
<EOS>
"
I
will
not

with
me
all
my
life
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
sure
of
myself
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nancy
's
utmost
dread
have
return
.
 
<EOS>
the
eye
of
the
husband
and
wife
meet
with
awe
in
them
,
as
at
a
crisis
which
suspend
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nancy
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
slowly
,
"
when
I
marry
you
,
I
hide
something
from
you
 
something
I
ought
to
have
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
that
woman
Marner
find
dead
in
the
snow
 
<EOS>
Eppie
's
mother
 
<EOS>
that
wretched
woman
 
be
my
wife
:
Eppie
be
my
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
,
dread
the
effect
of
his
confession
.
 
<EOS>
but
Nancy
sit
quite
still
,
only
that
her
eye
drop
and
cease
to
meet
his
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
pale
and
quiet
as
a
meditative
statue
,
clasp
her
hand
on
her
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
think
the
same
of
me
again
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
after
a
little
while
,
with
some
tremor
in
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ought
not
to
have
leave
the
child
unowne
:
I
ought
not
to
have
keep
it
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
bear
to
give
you
up
,
Nancy
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
lead
away
into
marry
her
 
<EOS>
I
suffer
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
still
Nancy
be
silent
,
look
down
;
and
he
almost
expect
that
she
would
presently
get
up
and
say
she
would
go
to
her
father
's
.
<EOS>
how
could
she
have
any
mercy
for
fault
that
must
seem
so
black
to
her
,
with
her
simple
,
severe
notion
?
  
<EOS>
but
at
last
she
lift
up
her
eye
to
his
again
and
speak
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
indignation
in
her
voice
 
only
deep
regret
.
  
<EOS>
"
Godfrey
,
if
you
have
but
tell
me
this
six
year
ago
,
we
could
have
do
some
of
our
duty
by
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
would
have
refuse
to
take
her
in
,
if
I
would
know
she
be
yours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
that
moment
Godfrey
feel
all
the
bitterness
of
an
error
that
be
not
simply
futile
,
but
have
defeat
its
own
end
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
measure
this
wife
with
whom
he
have
live
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
speak
again
,
with
more
agitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
 
oh
,
Godfrey
 
if
we
would
have
her
from
the
first
,
if
you
would
take
to
her
as
you
ought
,
she
would
have
love
me
for
her
mother
 
<EOS>
and
you
would
have
be
happy
with
me
<EOS>
:
I
could
better
have
bear
my
little
baby
die
,
and
our
life
may
have
be
more
like
what
we
use
to
think
it

ud
be

"
  
<EOS>
the
tear
fall
,
and
Nancy
cease
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
would
not
have
marry
me
then
,
Nancy
,
if
I
would
tell
you
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
urge
,
in
the
bitterness
of
his
self
-
reproach
,
to
prove
to
himself
that
his
conduct
have
not
be
utter
folly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
think
you
would
now
,
but
you
would
not
then
.
 
<EOS>
with
your
pride
and
your
father
's
,
you
would
have
hate
have
anything
to
do
with
me
after
the
talk
there
'd
have
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
what
I
should
have
do
about
that
,
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
marry
anybody
else

<EOS>
but
I
be
not
worth
do
wrong
for
 
<EOS>
nothing

<EOS>
nothing
be
so
good
as
it
seem
beforehand
 
not
even
our
marrying

not

you
see

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
faint
sad
smile
on
Nancy
's
face
as
she
say
the
last
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
bad
man
than
you
think
I
be
,
Nancy
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
rather
tremulously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
forgive
me
ever
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
wrong
to
me
be
but
little
,
Godfrey
<EOS>
:
you
have
make
it
up
to
me
 
<EOS>
you
have
be
good
to
me
for
fifteen
year
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
another
you
do
the
wrong
to
;
and
I
doubt
it
can
never
be
all
make
up
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
we
can
take
Eppie
now
,
"
say
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
mind
the
world
know
at
last

<EOS>
I
will
be
plain
and
open
for
the
rest
o

my

"
It
will
be
different
come
to
us
<EOS>
,
now
she
be
grow
up
,

say
Nancy
,
shake
her
head
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
your
duty
to
acknowledge
her
and
provide
for
her
;
and
I
will
do
my
part
by
her
,
and
pray
to
God
Almighty
to
make
her
love
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
we
will
go
together
to
Silas
Marner
be
this
very
night
,
as
soon
as
everything
's
quiet
at
the
Stone
-
pit
.
"
    
<EOS>
between
eight
and
nine
o'clock
that
evening
,
Eppie
and
Silas
be
seat
alone
in
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
great
excitement
the
weaver
have
undergo
from
the
event
of
the
afternoon
,
he
have
feel
a
longing
for
this
quietude
,
and
have
even
beg
Mrs.
Winthrop
and
Aaron
,
who
have
naturally
linger
behind
every
one
else
,
to
leave
him
alone
with
his
child
.
 
<EOS>
the
excitement
have
not
pass
away
:
it
have
only
reach
that
stage
when
the
keenness
of
the
susceptibility
make
external
stimulus
intolerable
 
when
there
be
no
sense
of
weariness
,
but
rather
an
intensity
of
inward
life
,
under
which
sleep
be
an
impossibility
.
 
<EOS>
any
one
who
have
watch
such
moment
in
other
man
remember
the
brightness
of
the
eye
and
the
strange
definiteness
that
come
over
coarse
feature
from
that
transient
influence
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
a
new
fineness
of
ear
for
all
spiritual
voice
have
send
wonder
-
work
vibration
through
the
heavy
mortal
frame
 
as
if
"
beauty

into
the
face

<EOS>
Silas
's
face
show
that
sort
of
transfiguration
,
as
he
sit
in
his
arm
-
chair
and
look
at
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
draw
her
own
chair
towards
his
knee
,
and
lean
forward
,
hold
both
his
hand
,
while
she
look
up
at
him

<EOS>
on
the
table
near
them
,
light
by
a
candle

lie
the
recovered
gold
 
the
old
long

gold

range
in
orderly
heap

as
Silas
use
to
range
it
in
the
day
when
it
be
his
only
joy

<EOS>
He
have
be
tell
her
how
he
use
to
count
it
every
night
,
and
how
his
soul
be
utterly
desolate
till
she
be
send
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
first
,
I
would
a
sort

feeling
come
across
me
now

then
,

he
be
say
in
a
subdued
tone

"
as
if
you
may
be
change
into
the

again

for
sometimes
,
turn
my
head
which
way
<EOS>
I
would
,
I
seem
to
see
the
gold
;

I
think
I
should
be
glad
if
I
could
feel
it
,

find
it
be
come
back

that
do
not

after
a
bit
,
I

curse
come
again

drive
you
from

un

what
your
old
father

I
know
now
,
father

"
say
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
it
have
not

for
you
,
they
would
have
take
me
to
the
workhouse

there

I

the

It
be
wonderful

"
  
<EOS>
Silas
sit
in
silence
a
few
minute
,
look
at
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
take
no
hold
of
me
now

he
say
,
ponderingly
 
"
the
money
do
not

<EOS>
I
wonder
if
it
ever
could
again
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
may
,
if
I
lose
you
,
Eppie
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
come
to
think
I
be
forsake
again
,
and
lose
the
feeling
that
God
be
good
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
that
moment
there
be
a
knocking
at
the
door
;
and
Eppie
be
oblige
to
rise
without
answer
Silas
.
 
<EOS>
beautiful
she
look
,
with
the
tenderness
of
gather
tear
in
her
eye
and
a
slight
flush
on
her
cheek
,
as
she
step
to
open
the
door

<EOS>
the
flush
deepen
when
she

She
make

It
seem
to
him
that

a

readily
pass

oppose
what
be
undoubtedly

very

it

she
may

some
low

to
hurt
you
after
what
you
have
do
,
and
what
I
have
leave
undone
,
I
feel
now
<EOS>
it
be
my
duty
to
insist
on
take
care
of
my
own
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
do
my
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
whether
it
be
Silas
or
Eppie
<EOS>
that
be
more
deeply
stir
by
this
last
speech
of
Godfrey
's
.
 
<EOS>
Thought
have
be
very
busy
in
Eppie
as
she
listen
to
the
contest
between
her
old
long
-
love
father
and
this
new
unfamiliar
father
who
have
suddenly
come
to
fill
the
place
of
that
black
featureless
shadow
which
have
hold
the
ring
and
place
it
on
her
mother
's
finger
.
 
<EOS>
Her
imagination
have
dart
backward
in
conjecture
,
and
forward
in
prevision
,
of
what
this
reveal
fatherhood
imply
;
and
there
be
word
in
Godfrey
's
last
speech
which
help
to
make
the
prevision
especially
definite
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
these
thought
,
either
of
past
or
future
,
determine
her
resolution
 
_
that
_
be
determine
by
the
feeling
which
vibrate
to
every
word
Silas
have
utter
;
but
they
raise
,
even
apart
from
these
feeling
,
a
repulsion
towards
the
offer
lot
and
the
newly
-
reveal
father
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
,
on
the
other
hand
,
be
again
stricken
in
conscience
,
and
alarm
lest
Godfrey
's
accusation
should
be
true
 
lest
he
should
be
raise
his
own
will
as
an
obstacle
to
Eppie
's
good
.
 
<EOS>
for
many
moment
he
be
mute
,
struggle
for
the
self
-
conquest
necessary
to
the
uttering
of
the
difficult
word
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
out
tremulously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
let
it
be
as
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
speak
to
the
child
.
<EOS>
I
will
hinder
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
even
Nancy
,
with
all
the
acute
sensibility
of
her
own
affection
,
share
her
husband
's
view
,
that
Marner
be
not
justifiable
in
his
wish
to
retain
Eppie
,
after
her
real
father
have
avow
himself
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
that
it
be
a
very
hard
trial
for
the
poor
weaver
,
but
her
code
allow
no
question
that
a
father
by
blood
must
have
a
claim
above
that
of
any
foster
-
father
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
Nancy
,
use
all
her
life
to
plenteous
circumstance
and
the
privilege
of
"
respectability
"
,
could
not
enter
into
the
pleasure
which
early
nurture
and
habit
connect
with
all
the
little
aim
and
effort
of
the
poor
who
be
bear
poor
:
to
her
mind
,
Eppie
,
in
be
restore
to
her
birthright
,
be
enter
on
a
too
long
withhold
but
unquestionable
good
.
 
<EOS>
hence
she
hear
Silas
's
last
word
with
relief
,
and
think
,
as
Godfrey
do
,
that
their
wish
be
achieve
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eppie
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Godfrey
,
look
at
his
daughter
,
not
without
some
embarrassment
,
under
the
sense
that
she
be
old
enough
to
judge
him
,
"
it
will
always
be
our
wish

many

Eppie
do
not

forward

curtsy

as
she
have
do
before

She
hold
Silas

hand
in
hers

and
grasp
it
firmly

a

with
a
palm

tip
that

in

walk
home
under

starlight
in
silence

when
they
enter
the
oaken
parlour

Godfrey
throw
himself
into
his
chair
,
while
Nancy
lay
down
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
stand
on
the
hearth
near
her
husband
,
unwilling
to
leave
him
even
for
a
few
minute
,
and
yet
fear
to
utter
any
word
lest
it
may
jar
on
his
feeling

<EOS>
at
last
Godfrey
turn
his
head
towards
her
,
and
their
eye
meet
,
dwell
in
that
meeting
without
any
movement
on
either
side

<EOS>
that
quiet
mutual
gaze
of
a
trust
husband

wife
be
like
the
first
moment
of
rest
or
refuge
from
a
great
weariness
or
a
great
danger
 
not
to
be
interfere
with
by
speech
or
action
which
would
distract
the
sensation
from
the
fresh
enjoyment

repose

but
presently
he
put
out
his
hand
,

as
Nancy
place
her
within
it

he
draw
her
towards
him
,

bend
to

relief

also
of
come

Aaron

with

after

cheer
him

no

in

and
then
we
must
go
to

straight
for'ard
for

up

They

always
on

<EOS>
"
perhaps
the
people

neither

CONCLUSION
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
time
of
the
year
which
be
hold
in
Raveloe
to
be
especially
suitable
for
a
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
when
the
great
lilacs
and
laburnum
in
the
old
-
fashioned
garden
show
their
golden
and
purple
wealth
above
the
lichen
-
tint
wall
,
and
when
there
be
calf
still
young
enough
to
want
bucketful
of
fragrant
milk
.
<EOS>
People
be
not
so
busy
then
as
they
must
become
when
the
full
cheese
-
making
and
the
mowing
have
set
in
;
and
besides
,
it
be
a
time
when
a
light
bridal
dress
could
be
wear
with
comfort
and
see
to
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
happily
the
sunshine
fall
more
warmly
than
usual
on
the
lilac
tuft
the
morning
that
Eppie
be
marry
,
for
her
dress
<EOS>
be
a
very
light
one
.
<EOS>
She
have
often
think
,
though
with
a
feeling
of
renunciation
,
that
the
perfection
of
a
wedding
-
dress
would
be
a
white
cotton
,
with
the
tiny
pink
sprig
at
wide
interval
;
so
that
when
Mrs.
Godfrey
Cass
beg
to
provide
one
,
and
ask
Eppie
to
choose
what
it
should
be
,
previous
meditation
have
enable
her
to
give
a
decide
answer
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
see
at
a
little
distance
as
she
walk
across
the
churchyard
and
down
the
village
,
she
seem
to
be
attire
in
pure
white
,
and
her
hair
look
like
the
dash
of
gold
on
a
lily
.
 
<EOS>
one
hand
be
on
her
husband
's
arm
,
and
with
the
other
she
clasp
the
hand
of
her
father
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
give
me
away
,
father
,
"
she
have
say
before
they
go
to
church
;
"
you
will
only
be
take
Aaron
to
be
a
son
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
dolly
Winthrop
walk
behind
with
her
husband
;
and
there
end
the
little
bridal
procession
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
eye
to
look
at
it
,
and
Miss
Priscilla
Lammeter
be
glad
that
she
and
her
father
have
happen
to
drive
up
to
the
door
of
the
Red
House
just
in
time
to
see
this
pretty
sight
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
come
to
keep
Nancy
company
to
-
day
,
because
Mr.
Cass
have
have
to
go
away
to
Lytherley
,
for
special
reason
.
 
<EOS>
that
seem
to
be
a
pity
,
for
otherwise
he
may
have
go
,
as
Mr.
Crackenthorp
and
Mr.
Osgood
certainly
would
,
to
look
on
at
the
wedding
-
feast
which
he
have
order
at
the
Rainbow
,
naturally
feel
a
great
interest
in
the
weaver
who
have
be
wrong
by
one
of
his
own
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
ha

wish
Nancy
have
have
the
luck
to
find
a
child
like
that
and
bring
her
up
,
"
say
Priscilla
to
her
father
,
as
they
sit
in
the
gig
;
"
I
should
ha

have
something
young
to
think
of
then
,
besides
the
lamb
and
the
calf
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

my

"
say
Mr.

;
"
one
feel
that
as
one

old

look
dim
to

they
would

use
to

;
and

pass
on
beyond

House
to
the
humbler
part
of

first
to
divine

that
old
Mr.
Macey
,
who
have
be
set
in
his
arm

chair
outside
his
own
door
,
would
expect
some
special
notice
as
they
pass
,
since

be
too
old
to
be
at
the
wedding
-
feast
.

Mr.
Macey
's
look
for
a
word
from
us
,
"
say
Dolly
;
"
he
will
be
hurt
if
we
pass
him
and
say
nothing
 
and
him
so
rack
with
rheumatiz
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
they
turn
aside
to
shake
hand
with
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
look
forward
to
the
occasion
,
and
have
his
premeditated
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Master
Marner
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
voice
that
quaver
a
good
deal
,
"
I
have
live
to
see
my
word
come
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
the
first
to
say
there
be
no
harm
in
you
,
though
your
look
may
be
again
'
you
;
and
I
be
the
first
to
say
you
would
get
your
money
back
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
nothing
but
rightful
as
you
should
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
would
ha
'
say
the
"
Amens
"
,
and
willing
,
at
the
holy
matrimony
;
but
Tookey
's
do
it
a
good
while
now
,
and
I
hope
you
will
have
none
the
bad
luck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
open
yard
before
the
Rainbow
the
party
of
guest
be
already
assemble
,
though
it
be
still
nearly
an
hour
before
the
appoint
feast
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
by
this
mean
they
could
not
only
enjoy
the
slow
advent
of
their
pleasure
;
they
have
also
ample
leisure
to
talk
of
Silas
Marner
's
strange
history
,
and
arrive
by
due
degree
at
the
conclusion
that
he
have
bring
a
blessing
on
himself
by
act
like
a
father
to
a
lone
motherless
child
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
farri
do
not
negative
this
sentiment
:
on
the
contrary
,
he
take
it
up
as
peculiarly
his
own
,
and
invite
any
hardy
person
present
to
contradict
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
meet
with
no
contradiction
;
and
all
difference
among
the
company
be
merge
in
a
general
agreement
with
Mr.
Snell
's
sentiment
,
that
when
a
man
have
deserve
his
good
luck
,
it
be
the
part
of
his
neighbour
to
wish
him
joy
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
bridal
group
approach
,
a
hearty
cheer
be
raise
in
the
Rainbow
yard
;
and
Ben
Winthrop
,
whose
joke
have
retain
their
acceptable
flavour
,
find
it
agreeable
to
turn
in
there
and
receive
congratulation
;
not
require
the
propose
interval
of
quiet
at
the
Stone
-
pit
before
join
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
Eppie
have
a
large
garden
than
she
have
ever
expect
there
now
;
and
in
other
way
there
have
be
alteration
at
the
expense
of
Mr.
Cass
,
the
landlord
,
to
suit
Silas
's
large
family
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
and
Eppie
have
declare
that
they
would
rather
stay
at
the
Stone
-
pit
than
go
to
any
new
home
.
<EOS>
the
garden
be
fence
with
stone
on
two
side
,
but
in
front
there
be
an
open
fence
,
through
which
the
flower
shine
with
answer
gladness
,
as
the
four
united
people
come
within
sight
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
father
,
"
say
Eppie
,
"
what
a
pretty
home
ours
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
nobody
could
be
happy
than
we
be
.
