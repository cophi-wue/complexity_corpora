   
<EOS>
the
storming
of
SERINGAPATAM
(
1799
)
extract
from
a
Family
Paper
  
<EOS>
I
address
these
line
 
write
in
India
 
to
my
relative
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
My
object
be
to
explain
the
motive
which
have
induce
me
to
refuse
the
right
hand
of
friendship
to
my
cousin
,
John
Herncastle
.
<EOS>
the
reserve
which
I
have
hitherto
maintain
in
this
matter
have
be
misinterpret
by
member
of
my
family
whose
good
opinion
I
can
not
consent
to
forfeit
.
<EOS>
I
request
them
to
suspend
their
decision
until
they
have
read
my
narrative
.
<EOS>
and
I
declare
,
on
my
word
of
honour
,
that
what
I
be
now
about
to
write
be
,
strictly
and
literally
,
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
the
private
difference
between
my
cousin
and
me
take
its
rise
in
a
great
public
event
in
which
we
be
both
concerned
 
the
storming
of
Seringapatam
,
under
General
Baird
,
on
the
4th
of
May
,
1799
.
  
<EOS>
in
order
that
the
circumstance
may
be
clearly
understand
,
I
must
revert
for
a
moment
to
the
period
before
the
assault
,
and
to
the
story
current
in
our
camp
of
the
treasure
in
jewel
and
gold
store
up
in
the
Palace
of
Seringapatam
.
    
<EOS>
one
of
the
wildest
of
these
story
relate
to
a
Yellow
Diamond
 
a
famous
gem
in
the
native
annal
of
India
.
  
<EOS>
the
early
know
tradition
describe
the
stone
as
have
be
set
in
the
forehead
of
the
four
-
handed
indian
god
who
typify
the
Moon
.
<EOS>
partly
from
its
peculiar
colour
,
partly
from
a
superstition
which
represent
it
as
feel
the
influence
of
the
deity
whom
it
adorn
,
and
grow
and
lessen
in
lustre
with
the
waxing
and
waning
of
the
moon
,
it
first
gain
the
name
by
which
it
continue
to
be
know
in
India
to
this
day
 
<EOS>
the
name
of
the
MOONSTONE
.
<EOS>
a
similar
superstition
be
once
prevalent
,
as
I
have
hear
,
in
ancient
Greece
and
Rome
;
not
apply
,
however
(
as
in
India
)
,
to
a
diamond
devote
to
the
service
of
a
god
,
but
to
a
semi
-
transparent
stone
of
the
inferior
order
of
gem
,
suppose
to
be
affect
by
the
lunar
influence
 
the
moon
,
in
this
latter
case
also
,
give
the
name
by
which
the
stone
be
still
know
to
collector
in
our
own
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
adventure
of
the
Yellow
Diamond
begin
with
the
eleventh
century
of
the
christian
era
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
date
,
the
Mohammedan
conqueror
,
Mahmoud
of
Ghizni
,
cross
India
;
seize
on
the
holy
city
of
Somnauth
;
and
strip
of
its
treasure
the
famous
temple
,
which
have
stand
for
century
 
the
shrine
of
Hindoo
pilgrimage
,
and
the
wonder
of
the
eastern
world
.
  
<EOS>
of
all
the
deity
worship
in
the
temple
,
the
moon
-
god
alone
escape
the
rapacity
of
the
conquer
Mohammedans

<EOS>
preserve
by
three
Brahmins

the
inviolate

Yellow
Diamond

,
be

night
,
and
be
transport
to
the
second
of
the
sacred
city
of
India
 
<EOS>
the
city
of
Benares
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
in
a
new
shrine
 
in
a
hall
inlaid
with
precious
stone
,
under
a
roof
support
by
pillar
of
gold
 
<EOS>
the
moon
-
god
be
set
up
and
worship
.
<EOS>
here
,
on
the
night
when
the
shrine
be
complete
,
Vishnu
the
Preserver
appear
to
the
three
Brahmins
in
a
dream
.
  
<EOS>
the
deity
breathe
the
breath
of
his
divinity
on
the
Diamond
in
the
forehead
of
the
god
.
<EOS>
and
the
Brahmins
knelt
and
hide
their
face
in
their
robe
.
<EOS>
the
deity
command
that
the
Moonstone
should
be
watch
,
from
that
time
forth
,
by
three
priest
in
turn
,
night
and
day
,
to
the
end
of
the
generation
of
man
.
<EOS>
and
the
Brahmins
hear
,
and
bow
before
his
will
.
<EOS>
the
deity
predict
certain
disaster
to
the
presumptuous
mortal
who
lay
hand
on
the
sacred
gem
,
and
to
all
of
his
house
and
name
who
receive
it
after
him
.
<EOS>
and
the
Brahmins
cause
the
prophecy
to
be
write
over
the
gate
of
the
shrine
in
letter
of
gold
.
  
<EOS>
one
age
follow
another
 
and
still
,
generation
after
generation
,
the
successor
of
the
three
Brahmins
watch
their
priceless
Moonstone
,
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
one
age
follow
another
until
the
first
year
of
the
eighteenth
christian
century
see
the
reign
of
Aurungzebe
,
Emperor
of
the
Moguls
.
<EOS>
at
his
command
havoc
and
rapine
be
let
loose
once
more
among
the
temple
of
the
worship
of
Brahmah
.
<EOS>
the
shrine
of
the
four
-
handed
god
be
pollute
by
the
slaughter
of
sacred
animal
;
the
image
of
the

break
in
piece
;
and
the
Moonstone
be
seize
by
an
officer
of
rank
in
the
army
of
Aurungzebe
.
  
<EOS>
Powerless
to
recover
their
lose
treasure
by
open
force
,
the
three
guardian
priest
follow
and
watch
it
in
disguise
.
<EOS>
the
generation
succeed
each
other
;
the
warrior
who
have
commit
the
sacrilege
perish
miserably
;
the
Moonstone
pass
(
carry
its
curse
with
it
)
from
one
lawless
Mohammedan
hand
to
another
;
and
still
,
through
all
chance
and
change
,
the
successor
of
the
three
guardian
priest
keep
their
watch
,
wait
the
day
when
the
will
of
Vishnu
the
Preserver
should
restore
to
them
their
sacred
gem
.
<EOS>
Time
roll
on
from
the
first
to
the
last
year
of
the
eighteenth
christian
century
.
<EOS>
the
Diamond
fall
into
the
possession
of
Tippoo
,
Sultan
of
Seringapatam
,
who
cause
it
to
be
place
as
an
ornament
in
the
handle
of
a
dagger
,
and
who
command
it
to
be
keep
among
the
choice
treasure
of
his
armoury
.
<EOS>
even
then
 
in
the
palace
of
the
Sultan
himself
 
the
three
guardian
priest
still
keep
their
watch
in
secret
.
<EOS>
there
be
three
officer
of
Tippoo
's
household
,
stranger
to
the
rest
,
who
have
win
their
master
's
confidence
by
conform

or
appear

conform

to
the
Mussulman
faith
;
and
to
those
three
man
report
point
as
the
three
priest
in
disguise
.
    
<EOS>
so
,
as
tell
in
our
camp
,
run
the
fanciful
story
of
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
It
make
no
serious
impression
on
any
of
us
except
my
cousin
 
whose
love
of
the
marvellous
induce
him
to
believe
it
.
<EOS>
on
the
night
before
the
assault
on
Seringapatam
,
he
be
absurdly
angry
with
me
,
and
with
other
,
for
treat
the
whole
thing
as
a
fable
.
<EOS>
a
foolish
wrangle
follow
;
and
Herncastle
's
unlucky
temper
get
the
well
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
declare
,
in
his
boastful
way
,
that
we
should
see
the
Diamond
on
his
finger
,
if
the
english
army
take
Seringapatam
.
<EOS>
the
sally
be
salute
by
a
roar
of
laughter
,
and
there
,
as
we
all
think
that
night
,
the
thing
end
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
now
take
you
on
to
the
day
of
the
assault
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
and
I
be
separate
at
the
outset
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
him
when
we
ford
the
river
;
when
we
plant
the
english
flag
in
the
first
breach
;
when
we
cross
the
ditch
beyond
;
and
,
fight
every
inch
of
our
way
,
enter
the
town
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
at
dusk
,
when
the
place
be
ours
,
and
after
General
Baird
himself
have
find
the
dead
body
of
Tippoo
under
a
heap
of
the
slain
,
that
Herncastle
and
I
meet
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
each
attach
to
a
party
send
out
by
the
general
's
order
to
prevent
the
plunder
and
confusion
which
follow
our
conquest
.
<EOS>
the
camp
-
follower
commit
deplorable
excess
;
and
,
worse
still
,
the
soldier
find
their
way
,
by
a
guard
door
,
into
the
treasury
of
the
Palace
,
and
load
themselves
with
gold
and
jewel
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
court
outside
the
treasury
that
my
cousin
and
I
meet
,
to
enforce
the
law
of
discipline
on
our
own
soldier
.
<EOS>
Herncastle
's
fiery
temper
have
be
,
as
I
could
plainly
see
,
exasperate
to
a
kind
of
frenzy
by
the
terrible
slaughter
through
which
we
have
pass
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
unfit
,
in
my
opinion
,
to
perform
the
duty
that
have
be
entrust
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
riot
and
confusion
enough
in
the
treasury
,
but
no
violence
that
I
see
.
<EOS>
the
man
(
if
I
may
use
such
an
expression
)
disgrace
themselves
good
-
humouredly
.
<EOS>
all
sort
of
rough
jest
and
catchword
be
bandy
about
among
them
;
and
the
story
of
the
Diamond
turn
up
again
unexpectedly
,
in
the
form
of
a
mischievous
joke
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
get
the
moonstone
?
<EOS>
"
be
the
rally
cry
which
perpetually
cause
the
plundering
,
as
soon
as
it
be
stop
in
one
place
,
to
break
out
in
another
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
still
vainly
try
to
establish
order
,
I
hear
a
frightful
yelling
on
the
other
side
of
the
courtyard
,
and
at
once
run
towards
the
cry
,
in
dread
of
find
some
new
outbreak
of
the
pillage
in
that
direction
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
to
an
open
door
,
and
see
the
body
of
two
Indians
(
by
their
dress
,
as
I
guess
,
officer
of
the
palace
)
lie
across
the
entrance
,
dead
.
  
<EOS>
a
cry
inside
hurry
me
into
a
room
,
which
appear
to
serve
as
an
armoury
.
<EOS>
a
third
Indian
,
mortally
wound
,
be
sink
at
the
foot
of
a
man
whose
back
be
towards
me
.
<EOS>
the
man
turn
at
the
instant
when
I
come
in
,
and
I
see
John
Herncastle
,
with
a
torch
in
one
hand
,
and
a
dagger
drip
with
blood
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
a
stone
,
set
like
a
pommel
,
in
the
end
of
the
dagger
's
handle
,
flash
in
the
torchlight
,
as
he
turn
on
me
,
like
a
gleam
of
fire
.
<EOS>
the
die
Indian
sink
to
his
knee
,
point
to
the
dagger
in
Herncastle
's
hand
,
and
say
,
in
his
native
language
 
<EOS>
"
the
Moonstone
will
have
its
vengeance
yet
on
you
and
yours
!
"
<EOS>
He
speak
those
word
,
and
fall
dead
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
could
stir
in
the
matter
,
the
man
who
have
follow
me
across
the
courtyard
crowd
in
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
rush
to
meet
them
,
like
a
madman
.
<EOS>
"
clear
the
room
!
"
he
shout
to
me
,
"
and
set
a
guard
on
the
door
!
"
<EOS>
the
man
fall
back
as
he
throw
himself
on
them
with
his
torch
and
his
dagger
.
<EOS>
I
put
two
sentinel
of
my
own
company
,
on
whom
I
could
rely
,
to
keep
the
door
.
<EOS>
through
the
remainder
of
the
night
,
I
see
no
more
of
my
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
,
the
plunder
still
go
on
,
General
Baird
announce
publicly
by
beat
of
drum
,
that
any
thief
detect
in
the
fact
,
be
he
whom
he
may
,
should
be
hang
.
<EOS>
the
provost
-
marshal
be
in
attendance
,
to
prove
that
the
General
be
in
earnest
;
and
in
the
throng
that
follow
the
proclamation
,
Herncastle
and
I
meet
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
hold
out
his
hand
,
as
usual
,
and
say
,
"
good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wait
before
I
give
him
my
hand
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
first
,
"
I
say
,
"
how
the
Indian
in
the
armoury
meet
his
death
,
and
what
those
last
word
mean
,
when
he
point
to
the
dagger
in
your
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
Indian
meet
his
death
,
as
I
suppose
,
by
a
mortal
wound
,
"
say
Herncastle
.
<EOS>
"
what
his
last
word
mean
I
know
no
more
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
narrowly
.
<EOS>
His
frenzy
of
the
previous
day
have
all
calm
down
.
<EOS>
I
determine
to
give
him
another
chance
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
all
you
have
to
tell
me
?
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
He
answer
,
"
that
be
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
turn
my
back
on
him
;
and
we
have
not
speak
since
.
    
<EOS>
I
beg
it
to
be
understand
<EOS>
that
what
I
write
here
about
my
cousin
(
unless
some
necessity
should
arise
for
make
it
public
)
be
for
the
information
of
the
family
only
.
<EOS>
Herncastle
have
say
nothing
that
can
justify
me
in
speak
to
our
command
officer
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
taunt
more
than
once
about
the
Diamond
,
by
those
who
recollect
his
angry
outbreak
before
the
assault
;
but
,
as
may
easily
be
imagine
,
his
own
remembrance
of
the
circumstance
under
which
I
surprise
him
in
the
armoury
have
be
enough
to
keep
him
silent
.
<EOS>
It
be
report
that
he
mean
to
exchange
into
another
regiment
,
avowedly
for
the
purpose
of
separate
himself
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
whether
this
be
true
or
not
,
I
can
not
prevail
upon
myself
to
become
his
accuser
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
with
good
reason
.
<EOS>
if
I
make
the
matter
public
,
I
have
no
evidence
but
moral
evidence
to
bring
forward
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
only
no
proof
that
he
kill
the
two
man
at
the
door
;
I
can
not
even
declare
that
he
kill
the
third
man
inside
 
for
I
can
not
say
that
my
own
eye
see
the
deed
commit
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
I
hear
the
die
Indian
's
word
;
but
if
those
word
be
pronounce
to
be
the
raving
of
delirium
,
how
could
I
contradict
the
assertion
from
my
own
knowledge
?
<EOS>
let
our
relative
,
on
either
side
,
form
their
own
opinion
on
what
I
have
write
,
and
decide
for
themselves
whether
the
aversion
I
now
feel
towards
this
man
be
well
or
ill
found
.
  
<EOS>
although
I
attach
no
sort
of
credit
to
the
fantastic
indian
legend
of
the
gem
,
I
must
acknowledge
,
before
I
conclude
,
that
I
be
influence
by
a
certain
superstition
of
my
own
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
conviction
,
or
my
delusion
,
no
matter
which
,
that
crime
bring
its
own
fatality
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
only
persuade
of
Herncastle
's
guilt
;
I
be
even
fanciful
enough
to
believe
that
he
will
live
to
regret
it
,
if
he
keep
the
Diamond
;
and
that
other
will
live
to
regret
take
it
from
him
,

the
STORY
  
FIRST
PERIOD
  
<EOS>
the
loss
of
the
diamond
(
1848
)
  
<EOS>
the
event
relate
by
GABRIEL
BETTEREDGE
,
house
-
steward
in
the
service
of
JULIA
,
LADY
VERINDER
.
      
<EOS>
in
the
first
part
of
ROBINSON
crusoe
,
at
page
one
hundred
and
twenty
-
nine
,
you
will
find
it
thus
write
:
  
"
<EOS>
now
I
see
,
though
too
late
,
the
Folly
of
begin
a
work
before
we
count
the
cost
,
and
before
we
judge
rightly
of
our
own
strength
to
go
through
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
only
yesterday
,
I
open
my
ROBINSON
crusoe
at
that
place
.
<EOS>
only
this
morning
(
May
twenty
-
first
,
eighteen
hundred
and
fifty
)
,
come
my
lady
's
nephew
,
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
and
hold
a
short
conversation
with
me
,
as
follow
:
    
"
Betteredge
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
I
have
be
to
the
lawyer
be
about
some
family
matter
;
and
,
among
other
thing
,
we
have
be
talk
of
the
loss
of
the
Indian
Diamond
,
in
my
aunt
's
house
in
Yorkshire
,
two
year
since
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
think
as
I
think
,
that
the
whole
story
ought
,
in
the
interest
of
truth
,
to
be
place
on
record
in
writing
 
and
the
sooner
the
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
not
perceive
his
drift
yet
,
and
think
it
always
desirable
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
quietness
to
be
on
the
lawyer
's
side
,
I
say
I
think
so
too
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
this
matter
of
the
Diamond
,
"
he
say
,
"
the
character
of
innocent
people
have
suffer
under
suspicion
already
 
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
the
memory
of
innocent
people
may
suffer
,
hereafter
,
for
want
of
a
record
of
the
fact
to
which
those
who
come
after
us
can
appeal
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
strange
family
story
of
ours
ought
to
be
tell
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
,
Betteredge
,
Mr.
Bruff
and
I
together
have
hit
on
the
right
way
of
tell
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
very
satisfactory
to
both
of
them
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
I
fail
to
see
what
I
myself
have
to
do
with
it
,
so
far
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
certain
event
to
relate
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
proceed
;
"
and
we
have
certain
person
concern
in
those
event
who
be
capable
of
relate
them
.
<EOS>
start
from
these
plain
fact
,
the
idea
be
that
we
should
all
write
the
story
of
the
Moonstone
in
turn
 
as
far
as
our
own
personal
experience
extend
,
and
no
farther
.
<EOS>
We
must
begin
by
show
how
the
Diamond
first
fall
into
the
hand
of
my
uncle
Herncastle
,
when
he
be
serve
in
India
fifty
year
since
.
<EOS>
this
prefatory
narrative
I
have
already
get
by
me
in
the
form
of
an
old
family
paper
,
which
relate
the
necessary
particular
on
the
authority
of
an
eye
-
witness
.
<EOS>
the
next
thing
to
do
be
to
tell
how
the
Diamond
find
its
way
into
my
aunt
's
house
in
Yorkshire
,
two
year
ago
,
and
how
it
come
to
be
lose
in
little
more
than
twelve
hour
afterwards
.
<EOS>
nobody
know
as
much
as
you
do
,
Betteredge
,
about
what
go
on
in
the
house
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
so
you
must
take
the
pen
in
hand
,
and
start
the
story
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
those
term
I
be
inform
of
what
my
personal
concern
be
with
the
matter
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
curious
to
know
what
course
I
take
under
the
circumstance
,
I
beg
to
inform
you
that
I
do
what
you
would
probably
have
do
in
my
place
.
<EOS>
I
modestly
declare
myself
to
be
quite
unequal
to
the
task
impose
upon
me
 
<EOS>
and
I
privately
feel
,
all
the
time
,
that
I
be
quite
clever
enough
to
perform
it
,
if
I
only
give
my
own
ability
a
fair
chance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
I
imagine
,
must
have
see
my
private
sentiment
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
He
decline
to
believe
in
my
modesty
;
and
he
insist
on
give
my
ability
a
fair
chance
.
  
<EOS>
two
hour
have
pass
since
Mr.
Franklin
leave
me
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
his
back
be
turn
,
I
go
to
my
write
desk
to
start
the
story
.
<EOS>
there
I
have
sit
helpless
(
in
spite
of
my
ability
)
ever
since
;
see
what
Robinson
Crusoe
see
,
as
quote
above
 
namely
,
the
folly
of
begin
a
work
before
we
count
the
cost
,
and
before
we
judge
rightly
of
our
own
strength
to
go
through
with
it
.
<EOS>
please
to
remember
,
I
open
the
book
by
accident
,
at
that
bit
,
only
the
day
before
I
rashly
undertake
the
business
now
in
hand
;
and
,
allow
me
to
ask
 
if
that
be
not
prophecy
,
what
be
?
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
superstitious
;
I
have
read
a
heap
of
book
in
my
time
;
I
be
a
scholar
in
my
own
way
.
<EOS>
though
turn
seventy
,
I
possess
an
active
memory
,
and
leg
to
correspond
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
to
take
it
,
if
you
please
,
as
the
saying
of
an
ignorant
man
,
when
I
express
my
opinion
that
such
a
book
as
ROBINSON
crusoe
never
be
write
,
and
never
will
be
write
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
try
that
book
for
year
 
generally
in
combination
with
a
pipe
of
tobacco
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
find
it
my
friend
in
need
in
all
the
necessity
of
this
mortal
life
.
<EOS>
when
my
spirit
be
bad
 
ROBINSON
crusoe
.
<EOS>
when
I
want
advice
 
ROBINSON
crusoe
.
<EOS>
in
past
time
when
my
wife
plague
me
;
in
present
time
when
I
have
have
a
drop
too
much
 
<EOS>
ROBINSON
crusoe
.
<EOS>
I
have
wear
out
six
stout
ROBINSON
crusoe
with
hard
work
in
my
service
.
<EOS>
on
my
lady
's
last
birthday
she
give
me
a
seventh
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
drop
too
much
on
the
strength
of
it
;
and
ROBINSON
crusoe
put
me
right
again
.
<EOS>
price
four
shilling
and
sixpence
,
bind
in
blue
,
with
a
picture
into
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
this
do
not
look
much
like
start
the
story
of
the
Diamond
 
do
it
?
<EOS>
I
seem
to
be
wander
off
in
search
of
Lord
know
what
,
Lord
know
where
.
<EOS>
We
will
take
a
new
sheet
of
paper
,
if
you
please
,
and
begin
over
again
,
with
my
good
respect
to
you
.
    
<EOS>
I
speak
of
my
lady
a
line
or
two
back
.
<EOS>
now
the
Diamond
could
never
have
be
in
our
house
,
where
it
be
lose
,
if
it
have
not
be
make
a
present
of
to
my
lady
's
daughter
;
and
my
lady
's
daughter
would
never
have
be
in
existence
to
have
the
present
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
my
lady
who
(
with
pain
and
travail
)
produce
her
into
the
world
.
<EOS>
consequently
,
if
we
begin
with
my
lady
,
we
be
pretty
sure
of
begin
far
enough
back
.
<EOS>
and
that
,
let
me
tell
you
,
when
you
have
get
such
a
job
as
mine
in
hand
,
be
a
real
comfort
at
start
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
know
anything
of
the
fashionable
world
,
you
have
hear
tell
of
the
three
beautiful
Miss
Herncastles
.
<EOS>
Miss
Adelaide
;
Miss
Caroline
;
and
Miss
Julia
 
<EOS>
this
last
be
the
young
and
the
good
of
the
three
sister
,
in
my
opinion
;
and
I
have
opportunity
of
judging
,
as
you
shall
presently
see
.
<EOS>
I
go
into
the
service
of
the
old
lord
,
their
father
(
thank
God
,
we
have
get
nothing
to
do
with
him
,
in
this
business
of
the
Diamond
;
he
have
the
long
tongue
and
the
short
temper
of
any
man
,
high
or
low
,
I
ever
meet
with
)
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
<EOS>
I
go
into
the
service
of
the
old
lord
,
as
page
-
boy
in
wait
on
the
three
honourable
young
lady
,
at
the
age
of
fifteen
year
.
<EOS>
there
I
live
till
Miss
Julia
marry
the
late
Sir
John
Verinder
.
<EOS>
an
excellent
man
,
who
only
want
somebody
to
manage
him
;
and
,
between
ourselves
<EOS>
,
he
find
somebody
to
do
it
;
and
what
be
more
,
he
thrive
on
it
and
grow
fat
on
it
,
and
live
happy
and
die
easy
on
it
,
date
from
the
day
when
my
lady
take
him
to
church
to
be
marry
,
to
the
day
when
she
relieve
him
of
his
last
breath
,
and
close
his
eye
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
omit
to
state
that
I
go
with
the
bride
to
the
bride
's
husband
's
house
and
land
down
here
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
John
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
can
not
do
without
Gabriel
Betteredge
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
lady
,
"
say
Sir
John
,
"
I
can
not
do
without
him
,
either
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
his
way
with
her
 
and
that
be
how
I
go
into
his
service
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
one
to
me
where
I
go
,
so
long
as
my
mistress
and
I
be
together
.
  
<EOS>
see
that
my
lady
take
an
interest
in
the
out
-
of
-
door
work
,
and
the
farm
,
and
such
like
,
I
take
an
interest
in
them
too
 
with
all
the
more
reason
that
I
be
a
small
farmer
's
seventh
son
myself
.
<EOS>
My
lady
get
me
put
under
the
bailiff
,
and
I
do
my
good
,
and
give
satisfaction
,
and
get
promotion
accordingly
.
<EOS>
some
year
later
,
on
the
Monday
as
it
may
be
,
my
lady
say
,
"
Sir
John
,
your
bailiff
be
a
stupid
old
man
.
<EOS>
pension
him
liberally
,
and
let
Gabriel
Betteredge
have
his
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
on
the
Tuesday
as
it
may
be
,
Sir
John
say
,
"
My
lady
,
the
bailiff
be
pension
liberally
;
and
Gabriel
Betteredge
have
get
his
place
.
<EOS>
"
You
hear
more
than
enough
of
married
people
live
together
miserably
.
<EOS>
here
be
an
example
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
let
it
be
a
warning
to
some
of
you
,
and
an
encouragement
to
other
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
I
will
go
on
with
my
story
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
there
I
be
in
clover
,
you
will
say
.
<EOS>
place
in
a
position
of
trust
and
honour
,
with
a
little
cottage
of
my
own
to
live
in
,
with
my
round
on
the
estate
to
occupy
me
in
the
morning
,
and
my
account
in
the
afternoon
,
and
my
pipe
and
my
ROBINSON
crusoe
in
the
evening
 
<EOS>
what
more
could
I
possibly
want
to
make
me
happy
?
<EOS>
remember
what
Adam
want
when
he
be
alone
in
the
Garden
of
Eden
;
and
if
you
do
not
blame
it
in
Adam
,
do
not
blame
it
in
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
I
fix
my
eye
on
,
be
the
woman
who
keep
house
for
me
at
my
cottage
.
<EOS>
Her
name
be
Selina
Goby
.
<EOS>
I
agree
with
the
late
William
Cobbett
about
pick
a
wife
.
<EOS>
see
that
she
chew
her
food
well
and
set
her
foot
down
firmly
on
the
ground
when
she
walk
,
and
you
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
Selina
Goby
be
all
right
in
both
these
respect
,
which
be
one
reason
for
marry
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
another
reason
,
likewise
,
entirely
of
my
own
discovering
.
<EOS>
Selina
,
be
a
single
woman
,
make
me
pay
so
much
a
week
for
her
board
and
service
.
<EOS>
Selina
,
be
my
wife
,
could
not
charge
for
her
board
,
and
would
have
to
give
me
her
service
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
point
of
view
I
look
at
it
from
.
<EOS>
economy
 
with
a
dash
of
love
.
<EOS>
I
put
it
to
my
mistress
,
as
in
duty
bind
,
just
as
I
have
put
it
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
turn
Selina
Goby
over
in
my
mind
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
I
think
,
my
lady
,
it
will
be
cheap
to
marry
her
than
to
keep
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
lady
burst
out
laugh
,
and
say
she
do
not
know
which
to
be
most
shocked
at
 
my
language
or
my
principle
.
<EOS>
some
joke
tickle
her
,
I
suppose
,
of
the
sort
that
you
can
not
take
unless
you
be
a
person
of
quality
.
<EOS>
understand
nothing
myself
but
that
I
be
free
to
put
it
next
to
Selina
,
I
go
and
put
it
accordingly
.
<EOS>
and
what
do
Selina
say
?
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
little
you
must
know
of
woman
,
if
you
ask
that
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
say
,
yes
.
  
<EOS>
as
my
time
draw
near
,
and
there
get
to
be
talk
of
my
have
a
new
coat
for
the
ceremony
,
my
mind
begin
to
misgive
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
compare
note
with
other
man
as
to
what
they
feel
while
they
be
in
my
interesting
situation
;
and
they
have
all
acknowledge
that
,
about
a
week
before
it
happen
,
they
privately
wish
themselves
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
go
a
trifle
further
than
that
myself
;
I
actually
rise
up
,
as
it
be
,
and
try
to
get
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
not
for
nothing
!
<EOS>
I
be
too
just
a
man
to
expect
she
would
let
me
off
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
compensation
to
the
woman
when
the
man
get
out
of
it
,
be
one
of
the
law
of
England
.
<EOS>
in
obedience
to
the
law
,
and
after
turn
it
over
carefully
in
my
mind
,
I
offer
Selina
Goby
a
feather
-
bed
and
fifty
shilling
to
be
off
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
You
will
hardly
believe
it
,
but
it
be
nevertheless
true
 
<EOS>
she
be
fool
enough
to
refuse
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
it
be
all
over
with
me
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
get
the
new
coat
as
cheap
as
I
could
,
and
I
go
through
all
the
rest
of
it
as
cheap
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
a
happy
couple
,
and
not
a
miserable
couple
.
<EOS>
We
be
six
of
one
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
how
it
be
I
do
not
understand
,
but
we
always
seem
to
be
get
,
with
the
good
of
motive
,
in
one

<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
go
on
with
my
business
as
bailiff
year
after
year
up
to
Christmas
1847
,
when
there
come
a
change
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
on
that
day
,
my
lady
invite
herself
to
a
cup
of
tea
alone
with
me
in
my
cottage
.
<EOS>
She
remark
that
,
reckon
from
the
year
when
I
start
as
page
-
boy
in
the
time
of
the
old
lord
,
I
have
be
more
than
fifty
year
in
her
service
,
and
she
put
into
my
hand
a
beautiful
waistcoat
of
wool
that
she
have
work
herself
,
to
keep
me
warm
in
the
bitter
winter
weather
.
  
<EOS>
I
receive
this
magnificent
present
quite
at
a
loss
to
find
word
to
thank
my
mistress
with
for
the
honour
she
have
do
me
.
<EOS>
to
my
great
astonishment
,
it
turn
out
,
however
,
that
the
waistcoat
be
not
an
honour
,
but
a
bribe
.
<EOS>
My
lady
have
discover
that
I
be
get
old
before
I
have
discover
it
myself
,
and
she
have
come
to
my
cottage
to
wheedle
me
(
if
I
may
use
such
an
expression
)
into
give
up
my
hard
out
-
of
-
door
work
as
bailiff
,
and
take
my
ease
for
the
rest
of
my
day
as
steward
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
make
as
good
a
fight
of
it
against
the
indignity
of
take
my
ease
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
but
my
mistress
know
the
weak
side
of
me
;
she
put
it
as
a
favour
to
herself
.
<EOS>
the
dispute
between
us
end
,
after
that
,
in
my
wipe
my
eye
,
like
an
old
fool
,
with
my
new
woollen
waistcoat
,
and
say
I
would
think
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
perturbation
in
my
mind
,
in
regard
to
think
about
it
,
be
truly
dreadful
after
my
lady
have
go
away
<EOS>
,
I
apply
the
remedy
which
I
have
never
yet
find
to
fail
me
in
case
of
doubt
and
emergency
.
<EOS>
I
smoke
a
pipe
and
take
a
turn
at
ROBINSON
crusoe
.
<EOS>
before
I
have
occupy
myself
with
that
extraordinary
book
five
minute
,
I
come
on
a
comfort
bit
(
page
one
hundred
and
fifty
-
eight
)
,
as
follow
:
"
to
-
day
we
love
,
what
to
-
morrow
we
hate
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
my
way
clear
directly
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
I
be
all
for
continue
to
be
farm
-
bailiff
;
to
-
morrow
,
on
the
authority
of
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
,
I
should
be
all
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
take
myself
to
-
morrow
while
in
to
-
morrow
's
humour
,
and
the
thing
be
do
.
<EOS>
My
mind
be
relieve
in
this
manner
,
I
go
to
sleep
that
night
in
the
character
of
Lady
Verinder
's
farm
bailiff
,
and
I
wake
up
the
next
morning
in
the
character
of
Lady
Verinder
's
house
-
steward
.
<EOS>
all
quite
comfortable
,
and
all
through
ROBINSON
crusoe
!
  
<EOS>
My
daughter
Penelope
have
just
look
over
my
shoulder
to
see
what
I
have
do
so
far
.
<EOS>
She
remark
that
it
be
beautifully
write
,
and
every
word
of
it
true
.
<EOS>
but
she
point
out
one
objection
.
<EOS>
She
say
what
I
have
do
so
far
be
not
in
the
least
what
I
be
want
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
ask
to
tell
the
story
of
the
Diamond
and
,
instead
of
that
,
I
have
be
tell
the
story
of
my
own
self
.
<EOS>
curious
,
and
quite
beyond
me
to
account
for
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
the
gentleman
who
make
a
business
and
a
living
out
of
write
book
,
ever
find
their
own
self
get
in
the
way
of
their
subject
,
like
me
?
<EOS>
if
they
do
,
I
can
feel
for
them
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
here
be
another
false
start
,
and
more
waste
of
good
writing
-
paper
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
now
?
<EOS>
nothing
that
I
know
of
,
except
for
you
to
keep
your
temper
,
and
for
me
to
begin
it
all
over
again
for
the
third
time
.
    
<EOS>
the
question
of
how
I
be
to
start
the
story
properly
I
have
try
to
settle
in
two
way
.
<EOS>
first
,
by
scratch
my
head
,
which
lead
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
second
,
by
consult
my
daughter
Penelope
,
which
have
result
in
an
entirely
new
idea
.
  
<EOS>
Penelope
's
notion
be
that
I
should
set
down
what
happen
,
regularly
day
by
day
,
begin
with
the
day
when
we
get
the
news
that
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
be
expect
on
a
visit
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
when
you
come
to
fix
your
memory
with
a
date
in
this
way
,
it
be
wonderful
what
your
memory
will
pick
up
for
you
upon
that
compulsion
.
<EOS>
the
only
difficulty
be
to
fetch
out
the
date
,
in
the
first
place
.
<EOS>
this
Penelope
offer
to
do
for
me
by
look
into
her
own
diary
,
which
she
be
teach
to
keep
when
she
be
at
school
,
and
which
she
have
go
on
keep
ever
since
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
an
improvement
on
this
notion
,
devise
by
myself
,
namely
,
that
she
should
tell
the
story
instead
of
me
,
out
of
her
own
diary
,
Penelope
observe
,
with
a
fierce
look
and
a
red
face
,
that
her
journal
be
for
her
own
private
eye
,
and
that
no
live
creature
shall
ever
know
what
be
in
it
but
herself
.
<EOS>
when
I
inquire
what
this
mean
,
Penelope
say
,
"
fiddlestick
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
sweetheart
.
  
<EOS>
beginning
,
then
,
on
Penelope
's
plan
,
I
beg
to
mention
that
I
be
specially
call
one
Wednesday
morning
into
my
lady
's
own
sitting
-
room
,
the
date
be
the
twenty
-
fourth
of
May
,
eighteen
hundred
and
forty
-
eight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
,
"
say
my
lady
,
"
here
be
news
that
will
surprise
you
.
<EOS>
Franklin
Blake
have
come
back
from
abroad
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
stay
with
his
father
in
London
,
and
he
be
come
to
us
to
-
morrow
to
stop
till
next
month
,
and
keep
Rachel
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
have
a
hat
in
my
hand
,
nothing
but
respect
would
have
prevent
me
from
throw
that
hat
up
to
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
Mr.
Franklin
since
he
be
a
boy
,
live
along
with
us
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
out
of
all
sight
(
as
I
remember
him
)
,
the
nice
boy
that
ever
spin
a
top
or
break
a
window
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
,
who
be
present
,
and
to
whom
I
make
that
remark
,
observe
,
in
return
,
that
she
remember
him
as
the
most
atrocious
tyrant
that
ever
torture
a
doll
,
and
the
hard
driver
of
an
exhausted
little
girl
in
string
harness
that
England
could
produce
.
<EOS>
"
I
burn
with
indignation
,
and
I
ache
with
fatigue
,
"
be
the
way
Miss
Rachel
sum
it
up
,
"
when
I
think
of
Franklin
Blake
.
"
  
<EOS>
hear
what
I
now
tell
you
,
you
will
naturally
ask
how
it
be
that
Mr.
Franklin
should
have
pass
all
the
year
,
from
the
time
when
he
be
a
boy
to
the
time
when
he
be
a
man
,
out
of
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
because
his
father
have
the
misfortune
to
be
next
heir
to
a
Dukedom
,
and
not
to
be
able
to
prove
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
two
word
,
this
be
how
the
thing
happen
:
  
My
lady
's
eld
sister
marry
the
celebrated
Mr.
Blake
 
equally
famous
for
his
great
rich
,
and
his
great
suit
at
law
.
<EOS>
how
many
year
he
go
on
worry
the
tribunal
of
his
country
to
turn
out
the
Duke
in
possession
,
and
to
put
himself
in
the
Duke
's
place
 
how
many
lawyer
's
purse
he
fill
to
burst
,
and
how
many
otherwise
harmless
people
he
set
by
the
ear
together
dispute
whether
he
be
right
or
wrong
 
<EOS>
be
more
by
a
great
deal
than
I
can
reckon
up
.
<EOS>
His
wife
die
,
and
two
of
his
three
child
die
,
before
the
tribunal
could
make
up
their
mind
to
show
him
the
door
and
take
no
more
of
his
money
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
all
over
,
and
the
Duke
in
possession
be
leave
in
possession
,
Mr.
Blake
discover
that
the
only
way
of
be
even
with
his
country
for
the
manner
in
which
it
have
treat
him
,
be
not
to
let
his
country
have
the
honour
of
educate
his
son
.
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
trust
my
native
institution
,
"
be
the
form
in
which
he
put
it
,
"
after
the
way
in
which
my
native
institution
have
behave
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
add
to
this
,
that
Mr.
Blake
dislike
all
boy
,
his
own
include
,
and
you
will
admit
that
it
could
only
end
in
one
way
.
<EOS>
Master
Franklin
be
take
from
us
in
England
,
and
be
send
to
institution
which
his
father
COULD
trust
,
in
that
superior
country
,
Germany
;
Mr.
Blake
himself
,
you
will
observe
,
remain
snug
in
England
,
to
improve
his
fellow
-
countryman
in
the
Parliament
House
,
and
to
publish
a
statement
on
the
subject
of
the
Duke
in
possession
,
which
have
remain
an
unfinished
statement
from
that
day
to
this
.
  
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
thank
God
,
that
be
tell
!
<EOS>
neither
you
nor
I
need
trouble
our
head
any
more
about
Mr.
Blake
,
senior
.
<EOS>
leave
him
to
the
Dukedom
;
and
let
you
and
I
stick
to
the
Diamond
.
  
<EOS>
the
Diamond
take
us
back
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
who
be
the
innocent
mean
of
bring
that
unlucky
jewel
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Our
nice
boy
do
not
forget
us
after
he
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
He
write
every
now
and
then
;
sometimes
to
my
lady
,
sometimes
to
Miss
Rachel
,
and
sometimes
to
me
.
<EOS>
We
have
have
a
transaction
together
,
before
he
leave
,
which
consist
in
his
borrowing
of
me
a
ball
of
string
,
a
four
-
blade
knife
,
and
seven
-
and
-
sixpence
in
money
 
the
colour
of
which
<EOS>
last
I
have
not
see
,
and
never
expect
to
see
again
.
<EOS>
His
letter
to
me
chiefly
related
to
borrow
more
.
<EOS>
I
hear
,
however
,
from
my
lady
,
how
he
get
on
abroad
,
as
he
grow
in
year
and
stature
.
<EOS>
after
he
have
learn
what
the
institution
of
Germany
could
teach
him
,
he
give
the
French
a
turn
next
,
and
the
Italians
a
turn
after
that
.
<EOS>
They
make
him
among
them
a
sort
of
universal
genius
,
as
well
as
I
could
understand
it
.
<EOS>
He
write
a
little
;
he
paint
a
little
;
he
sing
and
play
and
compose
a
little
 
borrowing
,
as
I
suspect
,
in
all
these
case
,
just
as
he
have
borrow
from
me
.
<EOS>
His
mother
's
fortune
(
seven
hundred
a
year
)
fall
to
him
when
he
come
of
age
,
and
run
through
him
,
as
it
may
be
through
a
sieve
.
<EOS>
the
more
money
he
have
,
the
more
he
want
;
there
be
a
hole
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
pocket
that
nothing
would
sew
up
.
<EOS>
wherever
he
go
,
the
lively
,
easy
way
of
him
make
him
welcome
.
<EOS>
He
live
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
;
his
address
(
as
he
use
to
put
it
himself
)
be
"
Post
Office
,
Europe
 
to
be
leave
till
call
for
.
"
<EOS>
twice
over
,
he
make
up
his
mind
to
come
back
to
England
and
see
us
;
and
twice
over
(
save
your
presence
)
,
some
unmentionable
woman
stand
in
the
way
and
stop
him
.
<EOS>
His
third
attempt
succeed
,
as
you
know
already
from
what
my
lady
tell
me
.
<EOS>
on
Thursday
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
May
,
we
be
to
see
for
the
first
time
what
our
nice
boy
have
grow
to
be
as
a
man
.
<EOS>
He
come
of
good
blood
;
he
have
a
high
courage
;
and
he
be
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
of
age
,
by
our
reckoning
.
<EOS>
now
you
know
as
much
of
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
as
I
do
 
before
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
come
down
to
our
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
Thursday
be
as
fine
a
summer
's
day
as
ever
you
see
:
and
my
lady
and
Miss
Rachel
(
not
expect
Mr.
Franklin
till
dinner
-
time
)
drive
out
to
lunch
with
some
friend
in
the
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
be
go
,
I
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
bedroom
which
have
be
get
ready
for
our
guest
,
and
see
that
all
be
straight
.
<EOS>
then
,
be
butl
in
my
lady
's
establishment
,
as
well
as
steward
(
at
my
own
particular
request
,
mind
,
and
because
it
vex
me
to
see
anybody
but
myself
in
possession
of
the
key
of
the
late
Sir
John
's
cellar
)
 
<EOS>
then
,
I
say
,
I
fetch
up
some
of
our
famous
Latour
claret
,
and
set
it
in
the
warm
summer
air
to
take
off
the
chill
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
conclude
to
set
myself
in
the
warm
summer
air
next
 
see
that
what
be
good
for
old
claret
be
equally
good
for
old
age
 
<EOS>
I
take
up
my
beehive
chair
to
go
out
into
the
back
court
,
when
I
be
stop
by
hear
a
sound
like
the
soft
beating
of
a
drum
,
on
the
terrace
in
front
of
my
lady
's
residence
.
  
<EOS>
go
round
to
the
terrace
,
I
find
three
mahogany
-
colour
Indians
,
in
white
linen
frock
and
trouser
,
look
up
at
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
Indians
,
as
I
see
on
look
closer
,
have
small
hand
-
drum
sling
in
front
of
them
.
<EOS>
behind
them
stand
a
little
delicate
-
look
light
-
haired
English
boy
carry
a
bag
.
<EOS>
I
judge
the
fellow
to
be
stroll
conjuror
,
and
the
boy
with
the
bag
to
be
carry
the
tool
of
their
trade
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
three
,
who
speak
English
and
who
exhibit
,
I
must
own
,
the
most
elegant
manner
,
presently
inform
me
that
my
judgment
be
right
.
<EOS>
He
request
permission
to
show
his
trick
in
the
presence
of
the
lady
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
be
not
a
sour
old
man
.
<EOS>
I
be
generally
all
for
amusement
,
and
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
distrust
another
person
because
he
happen
to
be
a
few
shade
dark
than
myself
.
<EOS>
but
the
good
of
us
have
our
weakness
 
and
my
weakness
,
when
I
know
a
family
plate
-
basket
to
be
out
on
a
pantry
-
table
,
be
to
be
instantly
remind
of
that
basket
by
the
sight
of
a
strolling
stranger
whose
manner
be
superior
to
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
inform
the
Indian
that
the
lady
of
the
house
be
out
;
and
I
warn
him
and
his
party
off
the
premise
.
<EOS>
He
make
me
a
beautiful
bow
in
return
;
and
he
and
his
party
go
off
the
premise
.
<EOS>
on
my
side
,
I
return
to
my
beehive
chair
,
and
set
myself
down
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
court
,
and
fall
(
if
the
truth
must
be
own
)
,
not
exactly
into
a
sleep
,
but
into
the
next
good
thing
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
rouse
up
by
my
daughter
Penelope
run
out
at
me
as
if
the
house
be
on
fire
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
she
want
?
<EOS>
She
want
to
have
the
three
indian
juggler
instantly
take
up
;
for
this
reason
,
namely
,
that
they
know
who
be
come
from
London
to
visit
us
,
and
that
they
mean
some
mischief
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
name
rouse
me
.
<EOS>
I
open
my
eye
,
and
make
my
girl
explain
herself
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
that
Penelope
have
just
come
from
our
lodge
,
where
she
have
be
have
a
gossip
with
the
lodge
-
keeper
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
two
girl
have
see
the
Indians
pass
out
,
after
I
have
warn
them
off
,
follow
by
their
little
boy
.
<EOS>
take
it
into
their
head
that
the
boy
be
ill
-
use
by
the
foreigner
 
for
no
reason
that
I
could
discover
,
except
that
he
be
pretty
and
delicate
-
look
 
<EOS>
the
two
girl
have
steal
along
the
inner
side
of
the
hedge
between
us
and
the
road
,
and
have
watch
the
proceeding
of
the
foreigner
on
the
outer
side
.
<EOS>
those
proceeding
result
in
the
performance
of
the
follow
extraordinary
trick
.
  
<EOS>
They
first
look
up
the
road
,
and
down
the
road
,
and
make
sure
that
they
be
alone
.
<EOS>
then
they
all
three
face
about
,
and
stare
hard
in
the
direction
of
our
house
.
<EOS>
then
they
jabber
and
dispute
in
their
own
language
,
and
look
at
each
other
like
man
in
doubt
.
<EOS>
then
they
all
turn
to
their
little
english
boy
,
as
if
they
expect
him
to
help
them
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
chief
Indian
,
who
speak
English
,
say
to
the
boy
,
"
hold
out
your
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
hear
those
dreadful
word
,
my
daughter
Penelope
say
she
do
not
know
what
prevent
her
heart
from
fly
straight
out
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
think
privately
that
it
may
have
be
her
stay
.
<EOS>
all
I
say
,
however
,
be
,
"
You
make
my
flesh
creep
.
"
<EOS>
(
NOTA
BENE
:
<EOS>
woman
like
these
little
compliment
.
)
  
<EOS>
well
,
when
the
Indian
say
,
"
hold
out
your
hand
,
"
the
boy
shrink
back
,
and
shake
his
head
,
and
say
he
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
the
Indian
,
thereupon
,
ask
him
(
not
at
all
unkindly
)
,
whether
he
would
like
to
be
send
back
to
London
,
and
leave
where
they
have
find
him
,
sleep
in
an
empty
basket
in
a
market
 
a
hungry
,
ragged
,
and
forsake
little
boy
.
<EOS>
this
,
it
seem
,
end
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
the
little
chap
unwillingly
hold
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
upon
that
,
the
Indian
take
a
bottle
from
his
bosom
,
and
pour
out
of
it
some
black
stuff
,
like
ink
,
into
the
palm
of
the
boy
's
hand
.
<EOS>
the
indian
 
first
touch
the
boy
's
head
,
and
make
sign
over
it
in
the
air
 
then
say
,
"
look
.
"
<EOS>
the
boy
become
quite
stiff
,
and
stand
like
a
statue
,
look
into
the
ink
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
(
so
far
,
it
seem
to
me
to
be
juggle
,
accompany
by
a
foolish
waste
of
ink
.
<EOS>
I
be
begin
to
feel
sleepy
again
,
when
Penelope
's
next
word
stir
me
up
.
)
  
<EOS>
the
Indians
look
up
the
road
and
down
the
road
once
more
 
<EOS>
and
then
the
chief
Indian
say
these
word
to
the
boy
;
<EOS>
"

the
english
gentleman
from
foreign
part
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
boy
say
,
"
I
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Indian
say
,
"
be

on
the
road
to
this
house
,
and
on
no
other
,

day
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
boy
say
,
"
It
be
on
the
road
to
this
house
,
and
on
no
other
,
that
the
english
gentleman
will
travel
to
-
day
.
"
<EOS>
the
Indian
put
a
second
question
 
after
wait
a
little
first
.
<EOS>
He
say
:
"
have
the
english
gentleman
get
It
about
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
boy
answer
 
also
,
after
wait
a
little
first
 
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Indian
put
a
third
and
last
question
:
"
Will
the
english
gentleman
come
here
,
as
he
have
promise
to
come
,
at
the
close
of
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
boy
say
,
"
I
can
not
tell
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Indian
ask
why
.
  
<EOS>
the
boy
say
,
"
I
be
tired
.
<EOS>
the
mist
rise
in
my
head
,
and
puzzle
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
see
no
more
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
the
catechism
end
.
<EOS>
the
chief
Indian
say
something
in
his
own
language
to
the
other
two
,
point
to
the
boy
,
and
point
towards
the
town
,
in
which
(
as
we
afterwards
discover
)
<EOS>
they
be
lodge
.
<EOS>
He
then
,
after
make
more
sign
on
the
boy
's
head
,
blow
on
his
forehead
,
and
so
wake
him
up
with
a
start
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
they
all
go
on
their
way
towards
the
town
,
and
the
girl
see
them
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Most
thing
they
say
have
a
moral
,
if
you
only
look
for
it
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
moral
of
this
?
  
<EOS>
the
moral
be
,
as
I
think
:
first
,
that
the
chief
juggler
have
hear
Mr.
Franklin
's
arrival
talk
of
among
the
servant
out
-
of
-
door
,
and
see
his
way
to
make
a
little
money
by
it
.
<EOS>
second
,
that
he
and
his
man
and
boy
(
with
a
view
to
make
the
say
money
)
mean
to
hang
about
till
they
see
my
lady
drive
home
,
and
then
to
come
back
,
and
foretell
Mr.
Franklin
's
arrival
by
magic
.
<EOS>
third
,
that
Penelope
have
hear
them
rehearse
their
hocus
-
pocus
,
like
actor
rehearse
a
play
.
<EOS>
fourth
,
that
I
should
do
well
to
have
an
eye
,
that
evening
,
on
the
plate
-
basket
.
<EOS>
fifth
,
that
Penelope
would
do
well
to
cool
down
,
and
leave
me
,
her
father
,
to
doze
off
again
in
the
sun
.
  
<EOS>
that
appear
to
me
to
be
the
sensible
view
.
<EOS>
if
you
know
anything
of
the
way
of
young
woman
,
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
Penelope
would
not
take
it
.
<EOS>
the
moral
of
the
thing
be
serious
,
accord
to
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
particularly
remind
me
of
the
Indian
's
third
question
,
have
the
english
gentleman
get
It
about
him
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
father
!
"
say
Penelope
,
clasp
her
hand
,
"
do
not
joke
about
this
.
<EOS>
what
do
"
It
'
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
ask
Mr.
Franklin
,
my
dear
,
"
I
say
,
"
if
you
can
wait
till
Mr.
Franklin
come
.
<EOS>
"
I
wink
to
show
I
mean
that
in
joke
.
<EOS>
Penelope
take
it
quite
seriously
.
<EOS>
My
girl
's
earnestness
tickle
me
.
<EOS>
"
what
on
earth
should
Mr.
Franklin
know
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
<EOS>
"
ask
him
,
"
say
Penelope
.
<EOS>
"
and
see
whether
he
think
it
a
laugh
matter
,
too
.
"
<EOS>
with
that
parting
shot
,
my
daughter
leave
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
settle
it
with
myself
,
when
she
be
go
,
that
I
really
would
ask
Mr.
Franklin
 
mainly
to
set
Penelope
's
mind
at
rest
.
<EOS>
what
be
say
between
us
,
when
I
do
ask
him
,
later
on
that
same
day
,
you
will
find
set
out
fully
in
its
proper
place
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
do
not
wish
to
raise
your
expectation
and
then
disappoint
them
,
I
will
take
leave
to
warn
you
here
 
before
we
go
any
further
 
that
you
will
not
find
the
ghost
of
a
joke
in
our
conversation
on
the
subject
of
the
juggler
.
<EOS>
to
my
great
surprise
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
like
Penelope
,
take
the
thing
seriously
.
<EOS>
how
seriously
,
you
will
understand
,
when
I
tell
you
that
,
in
his
opinion
,
"
It
"
mean
the
Moonstone
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
truly
sorry
to
detain
you
over
me
and
my
beehive
chair
.
<EOS>
a
sleepy
old
man
,
in
a
sunny
back
yard
,
be
not
an
interesting
object
,
I
be
well
aware
.
<EOS>
but
thing
must
be
put
down
in
their
place
,
as
thing
actually
happen
 
and
you
must
please
to
jog
on
a
little
while
longer
with
me
,
in
expectation
of
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
arrival
later
in
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
have
time
to
doze
off
again
,
after
my
daughter
Penelope
have
leave
me
,
I
be
disturb
by
a
rattling
of
plate
and
dish
in
the
servant
'
hall
,
which
mean
that
dinner
be
ready
.
<EOS>
take
my
own
meal
in
my
own
sitting
-
room
,
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
servant
'
dinner
,
except
to
wish
them
a
good
stomach
to
it
all
round
,
previous
to
compose
myself
once
more
in
my
chair
.
<EOS>
I
be
just
stretch
my
leg
,
when
out
bounce
another
woman
on
me
.
<EOS>
not
my
daughter
again
;
only
Nancy
,
the
kitchen
-
maid
,
this
time
.
<EOS>
I
be
straight
in
her
way
out
;
and
I
observe
,
as
she
ask
me
to
let
her
by
,
that
she
have
a
sulky
face
 
a
thing
which
,
as
head
of
the
servant
,
I
never
allow
,
on
principle
,
to
pass
me
without
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
turn
your
back
on
your
dinner
for
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
wrong
now
,
Nancy
?
"
  
Nancy
try
to
push
by
,
without
answer
;
upon
which
I
rise
up
,
and
take
her
by
the
ear
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
nice
plump
young
lass
,
and
it
be
customary
with
me
to
adopt
that
manner
of
show
that
I
personally
approve
of
a
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
wrong
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rosanna
's
late
again
for
dinner
,
"
say
Nancy
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
send
to
fetch
her
in

<EOS>
all
the
hard
work
fall
on
my
shoulder
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
let
me
alone
,
Mr.
Betteredge
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
person
here
mention
as
Rosanna
be
our
second
housemaid
.
<EOS>
have
a
kind
of
pity
for
our
second
housemaid
(
why
,
you
shall
presently
know
)
,
and
see
in
Nancy
's
face
,
that
she
would
fetch
her
fellow
-
servant
in
with
more
hard
word
than
may
be
needful
under
the
circumstance
,
it
strike
me
that
I
have
nothing
particular
to
do
,
and
that
I
may
as
well
fetch
Rosanna
myself
;
give
her
a
hint
to
be
punctual
in
future
,
which
I
know
she
would
take
kindly
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
Rosanna
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
the
sand
,
of
course
!
"
say
Nancy
,
with
a
toss
of
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
another
of
her
fainting
fit
this
morning
,
and
she
ask
to
go
out
and
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
patience
with
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
go
back
to
your
dinner
,
my
girl
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
patience
with
her
,
and
I
will
fetch
her
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nancy
(
who
have
a
fine
appetite
)
look
pleased
.
<EOS>
when
she
look
pleased
,
she
look
nice
.
<EOS>
when
she
look
nice
,
I
chuck
her
under
the
chin
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
immorality
 
<EOS>
it
be
only
habit
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
take
my
stick
,
and
set
off
for
the
sand
.
  
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
it
will
not
do
to
set
off
yet
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
again
to
detain
you
;
but
you
really
must
hear
the
story
of
the
sand
,
and
the
story
of
Rosanna
 
for
this
reason
,
that
the
matter
of
the
Diamond
touch
them
both
nearly
.
<EOS>
how
hard
I
try
to
get
on
with
my
statement
without
stop
by
the
way
,
and
how
badly
I
succeed
!
<EOS>
but
,
there
!
 
<EOS>
person
and
thing
do
turn
up
so
vexatiously
in
this
life

will
in
a
manner
insist
on
be
notice
.
<EOS>
let
us
take
it
easy
,
and
let
us
take
it
short
;
we
shall
be
in
the
thick
of
the
mystery
soon
,
I
promise
you
!
  
<EOS>
Rosanna
(
to
put
the
person
before
the
Thing
,
which
be
but
common
politeness
)
be
the
only
new
servant
in
our
house
.
<EOS>
about
four
month
before
the
time
I
be
write
of
,
my
lady
have
be
in
London
,
and
have
go
over
a
Reformatory
,
intend
to
save
forlorn
woman
from
drift
back
into
bad
way
,
after
they
have
get
release
from
prison
.
<EOS>
the
matron
,
see
my
lady
take
an
interest
in
the
place
,
point
out
a
girl
to
her
,
name
Rosanna
Spearman
,
and
tell
her
a
most
miserable
story
,
which
I
have
not
the
heart
to
repeat
here
;
for
I
do
not
like
to
be
make
wretched
without
any
use
,
and
no
more
do
you
.
<EOS>
the
upshot
of
it
be
,
that
Rosanna
Spearman
have
be
a
thief
,
and
not
be
of
the
sort
that
get
up
company
in
the
City
,
and
rob
from
thousand
,
instead
of
only
rob
from
one
,
the
law
lay
hold
of
her
,
and
the
prison
and
the
reformatory
follow
the
lead
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
the
matron
's
opinion
of
Rosanna
be
(
in
spite
of
what
she
have
do
)
that
the
girl
be
one
in
a
thousand
,
and
that
she
only
want
a
chance
to
prove
herself
worthy
of
any
christian
woman
's
interest
in
her
.
<EOS>
My
lady
(
be
a
christian
woman
,
if
ever
there
be
one
yet
)
say
to
the
matron
,
upon
that
,
"
Rosanna
Spearman
shall
have
her
chance
,
in
my
service
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
a
week
afterwards
,
Rosanna
Spearman
enter
this
establishment
as
our
second
housemaid
.
  
<EOS>
not
a
soul
be
tell
the
girl
's
story
,
except
Miss
Rachel
and
me
.
<EOS>
My
lady
,
do
me
the
honour
to
consult
me
about
most
thing
,
consult
me
about
Rosanna
.
<EOS>
have
fall
a
good
deal
latterly
into
the
late
Sir
John
's
way
of
always
agree
with
my
lady
,
I
agree
with
her
heartily
about
Rosanna
Spearman
.
  
<EOS>
a
fairer
chance
no
girl
could
have
have
than
be
give
to
this
poor
girl
of
ours
.
<EOS>
none
of
the
servant
could
cast
her
past
life
in
her
tooth
,
for
none
of
the
servant
know
what
it
have
be
.
<EOS>
She
have
her
wage
and
her
privilege
,
like
the
rest
of
them
;
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
friendly
word
from
my
lady
,
in
private
,
to
encourage
her
.
<EOS>
in
return
,
she
show
herself
,
I
be
bind
to
say
,
well
worthy
of
the
kind
treatment
bestow
upon
her
.
<EOS>
though
far
from
strong
,
and
trouble
occasionally
with
those
fainting
-
fit
already
mention
,
she
go
about
her
work
modestly
and
uncomplainingly
,
do
it
carefully
,
and
do
it
well
.
<EOS>
but
,
somehow
,
she
fail
to
make
friend
among
the
other
woman
servant
,
except
my
daughter
Penelope
,
who
be
always
kind
to
Rosanna
,
though
never
intimate
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
the
girl
do
to
offend
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
certainly
no
beauty
about
her
to
make
the
other
envious
;
she
be
the
plain
woman
in
the
house
,
with
the
additional
misfortune
of
have
one
shoulder
big
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
what
the
servant
chiefly
resent
,
I
think
,
be
her
silent
tongue
and
her
solitary
way
.
<EOS>
She
read
or
work
in
leisure
hour
when
the
rest
gossip
.
<EOS>
and
when
it
come
to
her
turn
to
go
out
,
nine
time
out
of
ten
she
quietly
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
have
her
turn
by
herself
.
<EOS>
She
never
quarrel
,
she
never
take
offence
;
she
only
keep
a
certain
distance
,
obstinately
and
civilly
,
between
the
rest
of
them
and
herself
.
<EOS>
add
to
this
that
,
plain
as
she
be
,
there
be
just
a
dash
of
something
that
be
not
like
a
housemaid
,
and
that
be
like
a
lady
,
about
her
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
in
her
voice
,
or
it
may
have
be
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
all
I
can
say
be
,
that
the
other
woman
pounce
on
it
like
lightne
the
first
day
she
come
into
the
house
,
and
say
(
which
be
most
unjust
)
that
Rosanna
Spearman
give
herself
air
.
  
<EOS>
have
now
tell
the
story
of
Rosanna
,
I
have
only
to
notice
one
of
the
many
queer
way
of
this
strange
girl
to
get
on
next
to
the
story
of
the
sand
.
  
<EOS>
Our
house
be
high
up
on
the
Yorkshire
coast
,
and
close
by
the
sea
.
<EOS>
We
have
get
beautiful
walk
all
round
us
,
in
every
direction
but
one
.
<EOS>
that
one
I
acknowledge
to
be
a
horrid
walk
.
<EOS>
It
lead
,
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
through
a
melancholy
plantation
of
firs
,
and
bring
you
out
between
low
cliff
on
the
lonely
and
ugliest
little
bay
on
all
our
coast
.
  
<EOS>
the
sand
-
hill
here
run
down
to
the
sea
,
and
end
in
two
spit
of
rock
jut
out
opposite
each
other
,
till
you
lose
sight
of
them
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
one
be
call
the
North
Spit
,
and
one
the
South
.
<EOS>
between
the
two
,
shift
backwards
and
forwards
at
certain
season
of
the
year
,
lie
the
most
horrible
quicksand
on
the
shore
of
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
,
something
go
on
in
the
unknown
deep
below
,
which
set
the
whole
face
of
the
quicksand
shivering
and
tremble
in
a
manner
most
remarkable
to
see
,
and
which
have
give
to
it
,
among
the
people
in
our
part
,
the
name
of
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
a
great
bank
,
half
a
mile
out
,
nigh
the
mouth
of
the
bay
,
break
the
force
of
the
main
ocean
come
in
from
the
offing
.
<EOS>
winter
and
summer
,
when
the
tide
flow
over
the
quicksand
,
the
sea
seem
to
leave
the
wave
behind
it
on
the
bank
,
and
roll
its
water
in
smoothly
with
a
heave
,
and
cover
the
sand
in
silence
.
<EOS>
a
lonesome
and
a
horrid
retreat
,
I
can
tell
you
!
<EOS>
no
boat
ever
venture
into
this
bay
.
<EOS>
no
child
from
our
fishing
-
village
,
call
Cobb
's
Hole
,
ever
come
here
to
play
.
<EOS>
the
very
bird
of
the
air
,
as
it
seem
to
me
,
give
the
Shivering
Sand
a
wide
berth
.
<EOS>
that
a
young
woman
,
with
dozen
of
nice
walk
to
choose
from
,
and
company
to
go
with
her
,
if
she
only
say
"
come
!
"
should
prefer
this
place
,
and
should
sit
and
work
or
read
in
it
,
all
alone
,
when
it
be
her
turn
out
<EOS>
,
I
grant
you
,
pass
belief
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
nevertheless
,
account
for
it
as
you
may
,
that
this
be
Rosanna
Spearman
's
favourite
walk
,
except
when
she
go
once
or
twice
to
Cobb
's
Hole
,
to
see
the
only
friend
she
have
in
our
neighbourhood
,
of
whom
more
anon
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
true
that
I
be
now
set
out
for
this
same
place
,
to
fetch
the
girl
in
to
dinner
,
which
bring
us
round
happily
to
our
former
point
,
and
start
us
fair
again
on
our
way
to
the
sand
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
no
sign
of
the
girl
in
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
when
I
get
out
,
through
the
sand
-
hill
,
on
to
the
beach
,
there
she
be
,
in
her
little
straw
bonnet
,
and
her
plain
grey
cloak
that
she
always
wear
to
hide
her
deform
shoulder
as
much
as
may
be
 
there
<EOS>
she
be
,
all
alone
,
look
out
on
the
quicksand
and
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
She
start
when
I
come
up
with
her
,
and
turn
her
head
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
not
look
me
in
the
face
be
another
of
the
proceeding
,
which
,
as
head
of
the
servant
,
I
never
allow
,
on
principle
,
to
pass
without
inquiry
 
<EOS>
I
turn
her
round
my
way
,
and
see
that
she
be
cry
.
<EOS>
My
bandanna
handkerchief
 
one
of
six
beauty
give
to
me
by
my
lady
 
be
handy
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
out
,
and
I
say
to
Rosanna
,
"
come
and
sit
down
,
my
dear
,
on
the
slope
of
the
beach
along
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
dry
your
eye
for
you
first
,
and
then
I
will
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
what
you
have
be
cry
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
you
come
to
my
age
,
you
will
find
sit
down
on
the
slope
of
a
beach
a
much
long
job
than
you
think
it
now
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
I
be
settle
,
Rosanna
have
dry
her
own
eye
with
a
very
inferior
handkerchief
to
mine
 
cheap
cambric
.
<EOS>
She
look
very
quiet
,
and
very
wretched
;
but
she
sit
down
by
me
like
a
good
girl
,
when
I
tell
her
.
<EOS>
when
you
want
to
comfort
a
woman
by
the
short
way
,
take
her
on
your
knee
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
this
golden
rule
.
<EOS>
but
there
!
<EOS>
Rosanna
be
not
Nancy
,
and
that
be
the
truth
of
it
!
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
tell
me
,
my
dear
,
"
I
say
,
"
what
be
you
cry
about
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
about
the
year
that
be
go
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
say
Rosanna
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
My
past
life
still
come
back
to
me
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
my
girl
,
"
I
say
,
"
your
past
life
be
all
sponge
out
.
<EOS>
why
can
not
you
forget
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
take
me
by
one
of
the
lappet
of
my
coat
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
slovenly
old
man
,
and
a
good
deal
of
my
meat
and
drink
get
splash
about
on
my
clothe
.
<EOS>
sometimes
one
of
the
woman
,
and
sometimes
another
,
clean
me
of
my
grease
.
<EOS>
the
day
before
,
Rosanna
have
take
out
a
spot
for
me
on
the
lappet
of
my
coat
,
with
a
new
composition
,
warrant
to
remove
anything
.
<EOS>
the
grease
be
go
,
but
there
be
a
little
dull
place
leave
on
the
nap
of
the
cloth
where
the
grease
have
be
.
<EOS>
the
girl
point
to
that
place
,
and
shake
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
stain
be
take
off
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
the
place
show
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
<EOS>
the
place
show
!
"
  
<EOS>
a
remark
which
take
a
man
unawares
by
mean
of
his
own
coat
be
not
an
easy
remark
to
answer
.
<EOS>
something
in
the
girl
herself
,
too
,
make
me
particularly
sorry
for
her
just
then
.
<EOS>
She
have
nice
brown
eye
,
plain
as
she
be
in
other
way
 
<EOS>
and
she
look
at
me
with
a
sort
of
respect
for
my
happy
old
age
and
my
good
character
,
as
thing
for
ever
out
of
her
own
reach
,
which
make
my
heart
heavy
for
our
second
housemaid
.
<EOS>
not
feel
myself
able
to
comfort
her
,
there
be
only
one
other
thing
to
do
.
<EOS>
that
thing
be
 
to
take
her
in
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
help
me
up
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
late
for
dinner
,
Rosanna
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
come
to
fetch
you
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
Mr.
Betteredge
!
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
tell
Nancy
to
fetch
you
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
think
you
may
like
your
scold
better
,
my
dear
,
if
it
come
from
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
instead
of
help
me
up
,
the
poor
thing
steal
her
hand
into
mine
,
and
give
it
a
little
squeeze
.
<EOS>
She
try
hard
to
keep
from
cry
again
,
and
succeed
 
for
which
I
respect
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
kind
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
any
dinner
to

day
 
let
me
bide
a
little
longer
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
make
you
like
to
be
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
that
bring
you
everlastingly
to
this
miserable
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
something
draw
me
to
it
,
"
say
the
girl
,
make
image
with
her
finger
in
the
sand
.
<EOS>
"
I
try
to
keep
away
from
it
,
and
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
"
say
she
in
a
low
voice
,
as
if
she
be
frightened
at
her
own
fancy
,
"
sometimes
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
I
think
that
my
grave
be
wait
for
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
roast
mutton
and
suet
-
pudde
wait
for
you
!
"
say
I.
"
go
in
to
dinner
directly
.
<EOS>
this
be
what
come
,
Rosanna
,
of
think
on
an
empty
stomach
!
<EOS>
"
I
speak
severely
,
be
naturally
indignant
(
at
my
time
of
life
)
to
hear
a
young
woman
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
talk
about
her
latter
end
!
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
seem
to
hear
me
:
she
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
keep
me
where
I
be
,
sit
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
place
have
lay
a
spell
on
me
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
dream
of
it
night
after
night
;
I
think
of
it
when
I
sit
stitch
at
my
work
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
be
grateful
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
<EOS>
you
know
I
try
to
deserve
your
kindness
,
and
my
lady
's
confidence
in
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
wonder
sometimes
whether
the
life
here
be
too
quiet
and
too
good
for
such
a
woman
as
I
be
,
after
all
I
have
go
through
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
after
all
I
have
go
through
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
lonely
to
me
to
be
among
the
other
servant
,
know
I
be
not
what
they
be
,
than
it
be
to
be
here
.
<EOS>
My
lady
do
not
know
,
the
matron
at
the
reformatory
do
not
know
,
what
a
dreadful
reproach
honest
people
be
in
themselves
to
a
woman
like
me
.
<EOS>
do
not
scold
me
,
there
be
a
dear
good
man
.
<EOS>
I
do
my
work

My

<EOS>
She
snatch
her
hand
off
my

,
and
suddenly
point
down
to
the
quicksand
.
"
<EOS>
look

I
look
where

point
.
<EOS>
the
tide
be
on
the
turn
,
and
the
horrid
sand
begin
to
shiver
.
<EOS>
the
broad
brown
face
of
it
heave
slowly
,
and
then
dimple
and
quiver
all
over

look
like
to
me

"
say
Rosanna
,
catch
me
by
the
shoulder
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
look
as
if
it
have
hundred
of
suffocate
people
under
it
 
all
struggle
to
get
to
the
surface
,
and
all
sink
lower
and
low
in
the
dreadful
deep
!
<EOS>
throw
a
stone
in
,
Mr.
Betteredge

<EOS>
throw
a
stone
in

let

see
the
sand
suck
it
down
!
"
  
<EOS>
here
be
unwholesome
talk
!
<EOS>
here
be
an
empty
stomach
feed
on
an
unquiet
mind
!
<EOS>
My
answer
 
a
pretty
sharp
one
,
in
the
poor
girl
's
own
interest
,
I
promise
you
!
 
<EOS>
be
at
my
tongue
's
end
,
when
it
be
snap
short
off
on
a
sudden
by
a
voice
among
the
sand
-
hill
shout
for
me
by
my
name
.
<EOS>
"
Betteredge
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
voice
,
"
<EOS>
where
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
here
!
<EOS>
"
I
shout
out
in
return
,
without
a
notion
in
my
mind
of
who
it
be
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
start
to
her
foot
,
and
stand
look
towards
the
voice
.
<EOS>
I
be
just
think
of
get
on
my
own
leg
next
,
when
I
be
stagger
by
a
sudden
change
in
the
girl
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
Her
complexion
turn
of
a
beautiful
red
,
which
I
have
never
see
in
it
before
;
she
brighten
all
over
with
a
kind
of
speechless
and
breathless
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
give
me
back
my
own
question
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
who
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
softly
,
more
to
herself
than
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
twist
round
on
the
sand
and
look
behind
me
.
<EOS>
there
,
come
out
on
us
from
among
the
hill
,
be
a
bright
-
eyed
young
gentleman
,
dress
in
a
beautiful
fawn
-
coloured
suit
,
with
glove
and
hat
to
match
,
with
a
rose
in
his
button
-
hole
,
and
a
smile
on
his
face
that
may
have
set
the
Shivering
Sand
itself
smile
at
him
in
return
.
<EOS>
before
I
could
get
on
my
leg
,
he
plump
down
on
the
sand
by
the
side
of
me
,
put
his
arm
<EOS>
round
my
neck
,
foreign
fashion
,
and
give
me
a
hug
that
fairly
squeeze
the
breath
out
of
my
body
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
dear
old
Betteredge
!
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
owe
you
seven
-
and
-
sixpence
.
<EOS>
now
do
you
know
who
I
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
bless
us
and
save
us
!
<EOS>
here
 
four
good
hour
before
we
expect
him
 
be
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
!
  
<EOS>
before
I
could
say
a
word
,
I
see
Mr.
Franklin
,
a
little
surprised
to
all
appearance
,
look
up
from
me
to
Rosanna
.
<EOS>
follow
his
lead
,
I
look
at
the
girl
too
.
<EOS>
She
be
blush
of
a
deep
red
than
ever
,
seemingly
at
have
catch
Mr.
Franklin
's
eye
;
and
she
turn
and
leave
us
suddenly
,
in
a
confusion
quite
unaccountable
to
my
mind
,
without
either
make
her
curtsey
to
the
gentleman
or
say
a
word
to
me
.
<EOS>
very
unlike
her
usual
self
:
a
civiller
and
better
-
behave
servant
,
in
general
,
you
never
meet
with
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
an
odd
girl
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
she
see
in
me
to
surprise
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
sir
,
"
I
answer
,
drolle
on
our
young
gentleman
's
Continental
education
,
"
it
be
the
varnish
from
foreign
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
set
down
here
Mr.
Franklin
's
careless
question
,
and
my
foolish
answer
,
as
a
consolation
and
encouragement
to
all
stupid
people
 
<EOS>
it
be
,
as
I
have
remark
,
a
great
satisfaction
to
our
inferior
fellow
-
creature
to
find
that
their
better
be
,
on
occasion
,
no
bright
than
they
be
.
<EOS>
neither
Mr.
Franklin
,
with
his
wonderful
foreign
training
,
nor
I
,
with
my
age
,
experience
,
and
natural
mother
-
wit
,
have
the
ghost
of
an
idea
of
what
Rosanna
Spearman
's
unaccountable
behaviour
really
mean
.
<EOS>
She
be
out
of
our
thought
,
poor
soul
,
before
we
have
see
the
last
flutter
of
her
little
grey
cloak
among
the
sand
-
hill
.
<EOS>
and
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
you
will
ask
,
naturally
enough
.
<EOS>
read
on
,
good
friend
,
as
patiently
as
you
can
,
and
perhaps
you
will
be
as
sorry
for
Rosanna
Spearman
as
I
be
,
when
I
find
out
the
truth
.
    
<EOS>
the
first
thing
I
do
,
after
we
be
leave
together
alone
,
be
to
make
a
third
attempt
to
get
up
from
my
seat
on
the
sand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
stop
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
one
advantage
about
this
horrid
place
,
"
he
say
;
"
we
have
get
it
all
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
stay
where
you
be
,
Betteredge
;
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
while
he
be
speak
,
I
be
look
at
him
,
and
try
to
see
something
of
the
boy
I
remember
,
in
the
man
before
me
.
<EOS>
the
man
put
me
out
.
<EOS>
look
as
I
may
,
I
could
see
no
more
of
his
boy
's
rosy
cheek
than
of
his
boy
's
trim
little
jacket
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
have
get
pale
:
his
face
,
at
the
low
part
be
cover
,
to
my
great
surprise
and
disappointment
,
with
a
curly
brown
beard
and
mustachio
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
lively
touch
-
and
-
go
way
with
him
,
very
pleasant
and
engaging
,
I
admit
;
but
nothing
to
compare
with
his
free
-
and
-
easy
manner
of
other
time
.
<EOS>
to
make
matter
bad
,
he
have
promise
to
be
tall
,
and
have
not
keep
his
promise
.
<EOS>
He
be
neat
,
and
slim
,
and
well
make
;
but
he
be
not
by
an
inch
or
two
up
to
the
middle
height
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
baffle
me
altogether
.
<EOS>
the
year
that
have
pass
have
leave
nothing
of
his
old
self
,
except
the
bright
,
straightforward
look
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
there
I
find
our
nice
boy
again
,
and
there
I
conclude
to
stop
in
my
investigation
.
  
<EOS>
"
welcome
back
to
the
old
place
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
all
the
more
welcome
,
sir
,
that
you
have
come
some
hour
before
we
expect
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
reason
for
come
before
you
expect
me
,
"
answer
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
,
Betteredge
,
that
I
have
be
follow
and
watch
in
London
,
for
the
last
three
or
four
day
;
and
I
have
travel
by
the
morning
instead
of
the
afternoon
train
,
because
I
want
to
give
a
certain
dark
-
look
stranger
the
slip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
those
word
do
more
than
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
They
bring
back
to
my
mind
,
in
a
flash
,
the
three
juggler
,
and
Penelope
's
notion
that
they
mean
some
mischief
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
watch
you
,
sir
,
 
and
why
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
about
the
three
Indians
you
have
have
at
the
house
to
-
day
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
without
notice
my
question
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
possible
,
Betteredge
,
that
my
stranger
and
your
three
juggler
may
turn
out
to
be
piece
of
the
same
puzzle
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
come
to
know
about
the
juggler
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
put
one
question
on
the
top
of
another
,
which
be
bad
manner
,
I
own
.
<EOS>
but
you
do
not
expect
much
from
poor
human
nature
 
<EOS>
so
do
not
expect
much
from
me

I

Penelope
at

Mr.
Franklin
;

She

Mr.

particular
about

divinely

<EOS>
I
be
something
dissatisfied
with
my

let
Mr.

kiss
her
;
Mr.

be
welcome

that

for

me

foolish

at

hand

however

there
be

He

repeat
after
me
two
of

the
chief

I
tell

here
follow
the
substance
of
what
I
say

write
out
entirely
for
your
benefit

attention

a

the
young
and
good
of
the
three
.
<EOS>
of
the
two
son
,
the
eld
,
Arthur
,
inherit
the
title
and
estate
.
<EOS>
the
second
,
the
honourable
John
,
get
a
fine
fortune
leave
him
by
a
relative
,
and
go
into
the
army
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
ill
bird
,
they
say
,
that
foul
its
own
nest
.
<EOS>
I
look
on
the
noble
family
of
the
Herncastles
as
be
my
nest
;
and
I
shall
take
it
as
a
favour
if
I
be
not
expect
to
enter
into
particular
on
the
subject
of
the
honourable
John
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
I
honestly
believe
,
one
of
the
great
blackguard
that
ever
live
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
say
more
or
less
for
him
than
that
.
<EOS>
He
go
into
the
army
,
begin
in
the
Guards
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
leave
the
Guards
before
he
be
two
-
and
-
twenty
 
<EOS>
never
mind
why
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
strict
in
the
army
,
and
they
be
too
strict
for
the
honourable
John
.
<EOS>
He
go
out
to
India
to
see
whether
they
be
equally
strict
there
,
and
to
try
a
little
active
service
.
<EOS>
in
the
matter
of
bravery
(
to
give
him
his
due
)
,
he
be
a
mixture
of
bull
-
dog
and
game
-
cock
,
with
a
dash
of
the
savage
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
the
taking
of
Seringapatam
.
<EOS>
soon
afterwards
he
change
into
another
regiment
,
and
,
in
course
of
time
,
change
into
a
third
.
<EOS>
in
the
third
he
get
his
last
step
as
lieutenant
-
colonel
,
and
,
get
that
,
get
also
a
sunstroke
,
and
come
home
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
back
with
a
character
that
close
the
door
of
all
his
family
against
him
,
my
lady
(
then
just
married
)
take
the
lead
,
and
declare
(
with
Sir
John
's
approval
,
of
course
)
that
her
brother
should
never
enter
any
house
of
hers
.
<EOS>
there
be
more
than
one
slur
on
the
Colonel
that
make
people
shy
of
him
;
but
the
blot
of
the
Diamond
be
all
I
need
mention
here
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
say
he
have
get
possession
of
his
indian
jewel
by
mean
which
,
bold
as
he
be
,
he
do
not
dare
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
He
never
attempt
to
sell
it
 
not
be
in
need
of
money
,
and
not
<EOS>
(
to
give
him
his
due
again
)
make
money
an
object
.
<EOS>
He
never
give
it
away
;
he
never
even
show
it
to
any
live
soul
.
<EOS>
some
say
he
be
afraid
of
its
get
him
into
a
difficulty
with
the
military
authority
;
other
(
very
ignorant
indeed
of
the
real
nature
of
the
man
)
say
he
be
afraid
,
if
he
show
it
,
of
its
cost
him
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
perhaps
a
grain
of
truth
mix
up
with
this
last
report
.
<EOS>
It
be
false
to
say
that
he
be
afraid
;
but
it
be
a
fact
that
his
life
have
be
twice
threaten
in
India
;
and
it
be
firmly
believe
that
the
Moonstone
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
back
to
England
,
and
find
himself
avoid
by
everybody
,
the
Moonstone
be
think
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
again
.
<EOS>
the
mystery
of
the
Colonel
's
life
get
in
the
Colonel
's
way
,
and
outlaw
him
,
as
you
may
say
,
among
his
own
people
.
<EOS>
the
man
would
not
let
him
into
their
club
;
the
woman
 
more
than
one
 
whom
he
want
to
marry
,
refuse
him
;
friend
and
relation
get
too
near
-
sight
to
see
him
in
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
some
man
in
this
mess
would
have
try
to
set
themselves
right
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
to
give
in
,
even
when
he
be
wrong
,
and
have
all
society
against
him
,
be
not
the
way
of
the
honourable
John
.
<EOS>
He
have
keep
the
Diamond
,
in
flat
defiance
of
assassination
,
in
India
.
<EOS>
He
keep
the
Diamond
,
in
flat
defiance
of
public
opinion
,
in
England
.
<EOS>
there
you
have
the
portrait
of
the
man
before
you
,
as
in
a
picture
:
a
character
that
brave
everything
;
and
a
face
,
handsome
as
it
be
,
that
look
possess
by
the
devil
.
  
<EOS>
We
hear
different
rumour
about
him
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
sometimes
they
say
he
be
give
up
to
smoking
opium
and
collect
old
book
;
sometimes
he
be
report
to
be
try
strange
thing
in
chemistry
;
sometimes
he
be
see
carouse
and
amuse
himself
among
the
low
people
in
the
low
slum
of
London
.
<EOS>
anyhow
,
a
solitary
,
vicious
,
underground
life
be
the
life
the
Colonel
lead
.
<EOS>
once
,
and
once
only
,
after
his
return
to
England
,
I
myself
see
him
,
face
to
face
.
  
<EOS>
about
two
year
before
the
time
of
which
I
be
now
write
,
and
about
a
year
and
a
half
before
the
time
of
his
death
,
the
Colonel
come
unexpectedly
to
my
lady
's
house
in
London
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
night
of
Miss
Rachel
's
birthday
,
the
twenty
-
first
of
June
;
and
there
be
a
party
in
honour
of
it
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
receive
a
message
from
the
footman
to
say
that
a
gentleman
want
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
go
up
into
the
hall
,
there
I
find
the
Colonel
,
waste
,
and
worn
,
and
old
,
and
shabby
,
and
as
wild
and
as
wicked
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
up
to
my
sister
,
"
say
he
;
"
and
say
that
I
have
call
to
wish
my
niece
many
happy
return
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
make
attempt
by
letter
,
more
than
once
already
,
to
be
reconcile
with
my
lady
,
for
no
other
purpose
,
I
be
firmly
persuade
,
than
to
annoy
her
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
first
time
he
have
actually
come
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
have
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
say
that
my
mistress
have
a
party
that
night
.
<EOS>
but
the
devilish
look
of
him
daunt
me
.
<EOS>
I
go
up
-
stair
with
his
message
,
and
leave
him
,
by
his
own
desire
,
wait
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
the
servant
stand
stare
at
him
,
at
a
distance
,
as
if
he
be
a
walk
engine
of
destruction
,
load
with
powder
and
shot
,
and
likely
to
go
off
among
them
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
have
a
dash
 
no
more
 
of
the
family
temper
.
"
<EOS>
tell
Colonel
Herncastle
,
"
she
say
,
when
I
give
her
her
brother
's
message
,
"
that
Miss
Verinder
be
engage
,
and
that
I
decline
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
try
to
plead
for
a
civiller
answer
than
that
;
know
the
Colonel
's
constitutional
superiority
to
the
restraint
which
govern
gentleman
in
general
.
<EOS>
quite
useless
!
<EOS>
the
family
temper
flash
out
at
me
directly
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
want
your
advice
,
"
say
my
lady
,
"
you
know
that
I
always
ask
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
for
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
I
go
downstairs
with
the
message
,
of
which
I
take
the
liberty
of
present
a
new
and
amended
edition
of
my
own
contriving
,
as
follow
:
"
My
lady
and
Miss
Rachel
regret
that
they
be
engage
,
Colonel
;
and
beg
to
be
excuse
have
the
honour
of
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
expect
him
to
break
out
,
even
at
that
polite
way
of
put
it
.
<EOS>
to
my
surprise
he
do
nothing
of
the
sort
;
he
alarm
me
by
take
the
thing
with
an
unnatural
quiet
.
<EOS>
His
eye
,
of
a
glitter
bright
grey
,
just
settle
on
me
for
a
moment
;
and
he
laugh
,
not
out
of
himself
,
like
other
people
,
but
into
himself
,
in
a
soft
,
chuckle
,
horridly
mischievous
way
.
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Betteredge
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
remember
my
niece
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
"
with
that
,
he
turn
on
his
heel
,
and
walk
out
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
birthday
come
round
,
and
we
hear
he
be
ill
in
bed
.
<EOS>
six
month
afterwards
 
that
be
to
say
,
six
month
before
the
time
I
be
now
write
of
 
there
come
a
letter
from
a
highly
respectable
clergyman
to
my
lady
.
<EOS>
It
communicate
two
wonderful
thing
in
the
way
of
family
news
.
<EOS>
first
,
that
the
Colonel
have
forgive
his
sister
on
his
death
-
bed
.
<EOS>
second
,
that
he
have
forgive
everybody
else
,
and
have
make
a
most
edifying
end
.
<EOS>
I
have
myself
(
in
spite
of
the
bishop
and
the
clergy
)
<EOS>
an
unfeigned
respect
for
the
Church
;
but
I
be
firmly
persuade
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
the
devil
remain
in
undisturbed
possession
of
the
Honourable
John
,
and
that
the
last
abominable
act
in
the
life
of
that
abominable
man
be
(
save
your
presence
)
to
take
the
clergyman
in
!
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
sum
-
total
of
what
I
have
to
tell
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
I
remark
that
he
listen
more
and
more
eagerly
the
longer
I
go
on
.
<EOS>
also
,
that
the
story
of
the
Colonel
be
send
away
from
his
sister
's
door
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
niece
's
birthday
,
seem
to
strike
Mr.
Franklin
like
a
shot
that
have
hit
the
mark
.
<EOS>
though
he
do
not
acknowledge
it
,
I
see
that
I
have
make
him
uneasy
,
plainly
enough
,
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
say
your
say
,
Betteredge
,
"
he
remark
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
turn
now
.
<EOS>
before
,
however
,
I
tell
you
what
discovery
I
have
make
in
London
,
and
how
I
come
to
be
mix
up
in
this
matter
of
the
Diamond
,
I
want
to
know
one
thing
.
<EOS>
You
look
,
my
old
friend
,
as
if
you
do
not
quite
understand
the
object
to
be
answer
by
this
consultation
of
ours
.
<EOS>
do
your
look
belie
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
My
look
,
on
this
occasion
at
any
rate
,
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
that
case
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
suppose
I
put
you
up
to
my
point
of
view
,
before
we
go
any
further
.
<EOS>
I
see
three
very
serious
question
involve
in
the
Colonel
's
birthday
-
gift
to
my
cousin
Rachel
.
<EOS>
follow
me
carefully
,
Betteredge
;
and
count
me
off
on
your
finger
,
if
it
will
help
you
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
with
a
certain
pleasure
in
show
how
clear
-
head
he
could
be
,
which
remind
me
wonderfully
of
old
time
when
he
be
a
boy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
question
the
first
:
<EOS>
be
the
Colonel
's
Diamond
the
object
of
a
conspiracy
in
India
?
<EOS>
question
the
second
:
have
the
conspiracy
follow
the
Colonel
's
Diamond
to
England
?
<EOS>
question
the
third
:
<EOS>
do
the
Colonel
know
the
conspiracy
follow
the
Diamond
;
and
have
he
purposely
leave
a
legacy
of
trouble
and
danger
to
his
sister
,
through
the
innocent
medium
of
his
sister
's
child
?
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
be
drive
at
,
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
do
not
let
me
frighten
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
to
say
that
,
but
he
have
frighten
me
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
be
right
,
here
be
our
quiet
English
house
suddenly
invade
by
a
devilish
Indian
Diamond
 
bring
after
it
a
conspiracy
of
living
rogue
,
set
loose
on
us
by
the
vengeance
of
a
dead
man
.
<EOS>
there
be
our
situation
as
reveal
to
me
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
last
word
!
<EOS>
who
ever
hear
the
like
of
it
 
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
mind
;
in
an
age
of
progress
,
and
in
a
country
which
rejoice
in
the
blessing
of
the
british
constitution
?
<EOS>
nobody
ever
hear
the
like
of
it
,
and
,
consequently
,
nobody
can
be
expect
to
believe
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
on
with
my
story
,
however
,
in
spite
of
that
.
  
<EOS>
when
you
get
a
sudden
alarm
,
of
the
sort
that
I
have
get
now
,
nine
time
out
of
ten
the
place
you
feel
it
in
be
your
stomach
.
<EOS>
when
you
feel
it
in
your
stomach
,
your
attention
wander
,
and
you
begin
to
fidget
.
<EOS>
I
fidget
silently
in
my
place
on
the
sand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
notice
me
,
contend
with
a
perturb
stomach
or
mind
 
which
you
please
;
they
mean
the
same
thing
 
and
,
check
himself
just
as
he
be
start
with
his
part
of
the
story
,
say
to
me
sharply
,
"
what
do
you
want
?
"
  
<EOS>
what
do
I
want
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
tell
him
;
but
I
will
tell
you
,
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
I
want
a
whiff
of
my
pipe
,
and
a
turn
at
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
.
    
<EOS>
keep
my
private
sentiment
to
myself
,
I
respectfully
request
Mr.
Franklin
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
reply
,
"
do
not
fidget
,
Betteredge
,
"
and
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
's
first
word
inform
me
that
his
discovery
,
concern
the
wicked
Colonel
and
the
Diamond
,
have
begin
with
a
visit
which
he
have
pay
(
before
he
come
to
us
)
to
the
family
lawyer
,
at
Hampstead
.
<EOS>
a
chance
word
drop
by
Mr.
Franklin
,
when
the
two
be
alone
,
one
day
,
after
dinner
,
reveal
that
he
have
be
charge
by
his
father
with
a
birthday
present
to
be
take
to
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
one
thing
lead
to
another
;
and
it
end
in
the
lawyer
mention
what
the
present
really
be
,
and
how
the
friendly
connexion
between
the
late
Colonel
and
Mr.
Blake
,
senior
,
have
take
its
rise
.
<EOS>
the
fact
here
be
really
so
extraordinary
,
that
I
doubt
if
I
can
trust
my
own
language
to
do
justice
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
try
to
report
Mr.
Franklin
's
discovery
,
as
nearly
as
may
be
,
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
own
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
the
time
,
Betteredge
,
"
he
say
,
"
when
my
father
be
try
to
prove
his
title
to
that
unlucky
Dukedom
?
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
that
be
also
the
time
when
my
uncle
Herncastle
return
from
India
.
<EOS>
My
father
discover
that
his
brother
-
in
-
law
be
in
possession
of
certain
paper
which
be
likely
to
be
of
service
to
him
in
his
lawsuit
.
<EOS>
He
call
on
the
Colonel
,
on
pretence
of
welcome
him
back
to
England
.
<EOS>
the
Colonel
be
not
to
be
delude
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
You
want
something
,
"
he
say
,
"
or
you
would
never
have
compromise
your
reputation
by
call
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
see
that
the
one
chance
for
him
be
to
show
his
hand
;
he
admit
,
at
once
,
that
he
want
the
paper
.
<EOS>
the
Colonel
ask
for
a
day
to
consider
his
answer
.
<EOS>
His
answer
come
in
the
shape
of
a
most
extraordinary
letter
,
which
my
friend
the
lawyer
show
me
.
<EOS>
the
Colonel
begin
by
say
that
he
want
something
of
my
father
,
and
that
he
beg
to
propose
an
exchange
of
friendly
service
between
them
.
<EOS>
the
fortune
of
war
(
that
be
the
expression
he
use
)
have
place
him
in
possession
of
one
of
the
large
diamond
in
the
world
;
and
he
have
reason
to
believe
that
neither
he
nor
his
precious
jewel
be
safe
in
any
house
,
in
any
quarter
of
the
globe
,
which
they
occupy
together
.
<EOS>
under
these
alarming
circumstance
,
he
have
determine
to
place
his
Diamond
in
the
keeping
of
another
person
.
<EOS>
that
person
be
not
expect
to
run
any
risk
.
<EOS>
He
may
deposit
the
precious
stone
in
any
place
especially
guard
and
set
apart
 
like
a
banker
's
or
jeweller
's
strong
-
room
 
for
the
safe
custody
of
valuable
of
high
price
.
<EOS>
His
main
personal
responsibility
in
the
matter
be
to
be
of
the
passive
kind
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
undertake
either
by
himself
,
or
by
a
trustworthy
representative
 
to
receive
at
a
prearrange
address
,
on
certain
prearranged
day
in
every
year
,
a
note
from
the
Colonel
,
simply
state
the
fact
that
he
be
a
live
man
at
that
date
.
<EOS>
in
the
event
of
the
date
pass
over
without
the
note
be
receive
,
the
Colonel
's
silence
may
be
take
as
a
sure
token
of
the
Colonel
's
death
by
murder
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
and
in
no
other
,
certain
sealed
instruction
relate
to
the
disposal
of
the
Diamond
,
and
deposit
with
it
,
be
to
be
open
,
and
follow
implicitly
.
<EOS>
if
my
father
choose
to
accept
this
strange
charge
,
the
Colonel
's
paper
be
at
his
disposal
in
return
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

what
do
your

do
,
sir
?
<EOS>

I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
?

Mr.
Franklin

I
will
tell
you
what
he
do
.
<EOS>
He
bring
the
invaluable
faculty
,
call
common
sense
,
to
bear
on
the
Colonel
's
letter
.
<EOS>
the
whole
thing
,
he
declare
,
be
simply
absurd
.
<EOS>
somewhere
in
his
indian
wandering
,
the
Colonel
have
pick
up
with
some
wretched
crystal
which
he
take
for
a
diamond
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
danger
of
his
be
murder
,
and
the
precaution
devise
to
preserve
his
life
and
his
piece
of
crystal
,
this
be
the
nineteenth
century
,
and
any
man
in
his
sense
have
only
to
apply
to
the
police
.
<EOS>
the
Colonel
have
be
a
notorious
opium
-
eater
for
year
past
;
and
,
if
the
only
way
of
get
at
the
valuable
paper
he
possess
be
by
accept
a
matter
of
opium
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
my
father
be
quite
willing
to
take
the
ridiculous
responsibility
impose
on
him
 
all
the
more
readily
that
it
involve
no
trouble
to
himself
.
<EOS>
the
Diamond
and
the
sealed
instruction
go
into
his
banker
's
strong

room
,
and
the
Colonel
's
letter
,
periodically
report
him

live
man
,
be
receive

open
by
our

lawyer

Mr.

my

<EOS>
no

have
view
the

nothing

probable
unless
it
appeal
to

only
believe
in

we
see
it
in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
plain
to
me
from
this
,
that
Mr.
Franklin
think
his
father
's
notion
about
the
Colonel
hasty
and
wrong
.

be
your

I
ask

Mr.

there
be
a
curious
want

the
most
slovenly

<EOS>
"
so
much
,

I
think
to
myself

He

<EOS>
Mr.

take
up

go
on

"
My

he
say
,
"
get
the
paper
he
want

and
never
see
his

in

again
from
that
time

<EOS>
year
after
year
,
on
the
prearranged
day
,
the
prearrange
letter
come
from
the
Colonel
,
and
be
open
by
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
letter
,
in
a
heap
,
all
of
them
write
in
the
same
brief
,
business
-
like
form
of
word
:
"
<EOS>
Sir
,
 
this
be
to
certify
that
I
be
still
a
live
man

let
the
Diamond
be

<EOS>
John
Herncastle

"
that
be
all
he
ever
write
,
and
that
come
regularly
to
the
day
;
until
some
six
or
eight
month
since
,
when
the
form
of
the
letter
vary
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
It
run
now
:
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
 
They
tell
me
I
be
die
.
<EOS>
come
to
me
,
and
help
me
to
make
my
will
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
go
,
and
find
him
,
in
the
little
suburban
villa
,
surround
by
its
own
ground
,
in
which
he
have
live
alone
,
ever
since
he
have
leave
India
.
<EOS>
He
have
dog
,
cat
,
and
bird
to
keep
him
company
;
but
no
human
being
near
him
,
except
the
person
who
come
daily
to
do
the
house
-
work
,
and
the
doctor
at
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
the
will
be
a
very
simple
matter
.
<EOS>
the
Colonel
have
dissipate
the
great
part
of
his
fortune
in
his
chemical
investigation
.
<EOS>
His
will
begin
and
end
in
three
clause
,
which
he
dictate
from
his
bed
,
in
perfect
possession
of
his
faculty
.
<EOS>
the
first
clause
provide
for
the
safe
keeping
and
support
of
his
animal
.
<EOS>
the
second
found
a
professorship
of
experimental
chemistry
at
a
northern
university
.
<EOS>
the
third
bequeath
the
Moonstone
as
a
birthday
present
to
his
niece
,
on
condition
that
my
father
would
act
as
executor
.
<EOS>
My
father
at
first
refuse
to
act
.
<EOS>
on
second
thought
,
however
,
he
give
way
,
partly
because
he
be
assure
that
the
executorship
would
involve
him
in
no
trouble
;
partly
because
Mr.
Bruff
suggest
,
in
Rachel
's
interest
,
that
the
Diamond
may
be
worth
something
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
the
Colonel
give
any
reason
,
sir
,
"
I
inquire
,
"
why
he
leave
the
Diamond
to
Miss
Rachel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
not
only
give
the
reason
 
he
have
the
reason
write
in
his
will
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
an
extract
,
which
you
shall
see
presently
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
slovenly
-
minded
,
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
one
thing
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
You
have
hear
about
the
Colonel
's
will
;
now
you
must
hear
what
happen
after
the
Colonel
's
death
.
<EOS>
It
be
formally
necessary
to
have
the
Diamond
value
,
before
the
Will
could
be
prove
.
<EOS>
all
the
jeweller
consult
,
at
once
confirm
the
Colonel
's
assertion
that
he
possess
one
of
the
large
diamond
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
the
question
of
accurately
value
it
present
some
serious
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Its
size
make
it
a
phenomenon
in
the
diamond
market
;
its
colour
place
it
in
a
category
by
itself
;
and
,
to
add
to
these
element
of
uncertainty
,
there
be
a
defect
,
in
the
shape
of
a
flaw
,
in
the
very
heart
of
the
stone
.
<EOS>
even
with
this
last
serious
draw
-
back
,
however
,
the
low
of
the
various
estimate
give
be
twenty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
conceive
my
father
's
astonishment
!
<EOS>
He
have
be
within
a
hair's
-
breadth
of
refuse
to
act
as
executor
,
and
of
allow
this
magnificent
jewel
to
be
lose
to
the
family
.
<EOS>
the
interest
he
take
in
the
matter
now
,
induce
him
to
open
the
sealed
instruction
which
have
be
deposit
with
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
show
this
document
to
me
,
with
the
other
paper
;
and
it
suggest
(
to
my
mind
)
<EOS>
a
clue
to
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
which
threaten
the
Colonel
's
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
do
believe
,
sir
,
"
I
say
,
"
that
there
be
a
conspiracy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
possess
my
father
's
excellent
common
sense
,
"
answer
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
I
believe
the
Colonel
's
life
be
threaten
,
exactly
as
the
Colonel
say
.
<EOS>
the
sealed
instruction
,
as
I
think
,
explain
how
it
be
that
he
die
,
after
all
,
quietly
in
his
bed
.
<EOS>
in
the
event
of
his
death
by
violence
(
that
be
to
say
,
in
the
absence
of
the
regular
letter
from
him
at
the
appoint
date
)
,
my
father
be
then
direct
to
send
the
Moonstone
secretly
to
Amsterdam
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
deposit
in
that
city
with
a
famous
diamond
-
cutter
,
and
it
be
to
be
cut
up
into
from
four
to
six
separate
stone
.
<EOS>
the
stone
be
then
to
be
sell
for
what
they
would
fetch
,
and
the
proceed
be
to
be
apply
to
the
founding
of
that
professorship
of
experimental
chemistry
,
which
the
Colonel
have
since
endow
by
his
Will
.
<EOS>
now
,
Betteredge
,
exert
those
sharp
wit
of
yours
,
and
observe
the
conclusion
to
which
the
Colonel
's
instruction
point
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
instantly
exert
my
wit
.
<EOS>
They
be
of
the
slovenly
english
sort
;
and
they
consequently
muddle
it
all
,
until
Mr.
Franklin
take
them
in
hand
,
and
point
out
what
they
ought
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remark
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
that
the
integrity
of
the
Diamond
,
as
a
whole
stone
,
be
here
artfully
make
dependent
on
the
preservation
from
violence
of
the
Colonel
's
life
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
satisfied
with
say
to
the
enemy
he
dread
,
"
kill
me
 
and
you
will
be
no
nearer
to
the
Diamond
than
you
be
now
;
it
be
where
you
can
not
get
at
it
 
in
the
guard
strong
-
room
of
a
bank
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
instead
,
"
kill
me
 
and
the
Diamond
will
be
the
Diamond
no
longer
;
its
identity
will
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
that
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
I
have
(
as
I
think
)
a
flash
of
the
wonderful
foreign
brightness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
mean
lower
the
value
of
the
stone
,
and
cheat
the
rogue
in
that
way
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
of
the
sort
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
inquire
about
that
.
<EOS>
the
flawed
Diamond
,
cut
up
,
would
actually
fetch
more
than
the
Diamond
as
it
now
be
;
for
this
plain
reason
 
that
from
four
to
six
perfect
brilliant
may
be
cut
from
it
,
which
would
be
,
collectively
,
worth
more
money
than
the
large
 
but
imperfect
single
stone
.
<EOS>
if
robbery
for
the
purpose
of
gain
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
conspiracy
,
the
Colonel
's
instruction
absolutely
make
the
Diamond
better
worth
steal
.
<EOS>
More
money
could
have
be
get
for
it
,
and
the
disposal
of
it
in
the
diamond
market
would
have
be
infinitely
easy
,
if
it
have
pass
through
the
hand
of
the
workman
of
Amsterdam
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lord
bless
us
,
sir
!
"
I
burst
out
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
plot
,
then
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
a
plot
organise
among
the
Indians
who
originally
own
the
jewel
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
 
"
a
plot
with
some
old
Hindoo
superstition
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
opinion
,
confirm
by
a
family
paper
which
I
have
about
me
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
see
,
now
,
why
the
appearance
of
the
three
indian
juggler
at
our
house
have
present
itself
to
Mr.
Franklin
in
the
light
of
a
circumstance
worth
note
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
force
my
opinion
on
you
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
the
idea
of
certain
choose
servant
of
an
old
Hindoo
superstition
devote
themselves
,
through
all
difficulty
and
danger
,
to
watch
the
opportunity
of
recover
their
sacred
gem
,
appear
to
me
to
be
perfectly
consistent
with
everything
that
we
know
of
the
patience
of
oriental
race
,
and
the
influence
of
oriental
religion
.
<EOS>
but
then
I
be
an
imaginative
man
;
and
the
butcher
,
the
baker
,
and
the
tax
-
gatherer
,
be
not
the
only
credible
reality
in
existence
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
let
the
guess
I
have
make
at
the
truth
in
this
matter
go
for
what
it
be
worth
,
and
let
us
get
on
to
the
only
practical
question
that
concern
us
.
<EOS>
do
the
conspiracy
against
the
Moonstone
survive
the
Colonel
's
death
?
<EOS>
and
do
the
Colonel
know
it
,
when
he
leave
the
birthday
gift
to
his
niece
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
begin
to
see
my
lady
and
Miss
Rachel
at
the
end
of
it
all
,
now
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
he
say
escape
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
very
willing
,
when
I
discover
the
story
of
the
Moonstone
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
to
be
the
mean
of
bring
it
here
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Bruff
remind
me
that
somebody
must
put
my
cousin
's
legacy
into
my
cousin
's
hand
 
and
that
I
may
as
well
do
it
as
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
after
take
the
Diamond
out
of
the
bank
,
I
fancy
I
be
follow
in
the
street
by
a
shabby
,
dark
-
complexioned
man
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
my
father
's
house
to
pick
up
my
luggage
,
and
find
a
letter
there
,
which
unexpectedly
detain
me
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
go
back
to
the
bank
with
the
Diamond
,
and
think
I
see
the
shabby
man
again
.
<EOS>
take
the
Diamond
once
more
out
of
the
bank
this
morning
,
I
see
the
man
for
the
third
time
,
give
him
the
slip
,
and
start
(
before
he
recover
the
trace
of
me
)
by
the
morning
instead
of
the
afternoon
train
.
<EOS>
here
I
be
,
with
the
Diamond
safe
and
sound
 
and
what
be
the
first
news
that
meet
me
?
<EOS>
I
find
that
three
stroll
Indians
have
be
at
the
house
,
and
that
my
arrival
from
London
,
and
something
which
I
be
expect
to
have
about
me
,
be
two
special
object
of
investigation
to
them
when
they
believe
themselves
to
be
alone
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
waste
time
and
word
on
their
pour
the
ink
into
the
boy
's
hand
,
and
tell
him
to
look
in
it
for
a
man
at
a
distance
,
and
for
something
in
that
man
's
pocket
.
<EOS>
the
thing
(
which
I
have
often
see
do
in
the
East
)
be
"
hocus
-
pocus
'
in
my
opinion
,
as
it
be
in
yours
.
<EOS>
the
present
question
for
us
to
decide
be
,
whether
I
be
wrongly
attach
a
meaning
to
a
mere
accident
?
<EOS>
or
whether
we
really
have
evidence
of
the
Indians
be
on
the
track
of
the
Moonstone
,
the
moment
it
be
remove
from
the
safe
keeping
of
the
bank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
neither
he
nor
I
seem
to
fancy
deal
with
this
part
of
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
We
look
at
each
other
,
and
then
we
look
at
the
tide
,
ooze
in
smoothly
,
high
and
high
,
over
the
Shivering
Sand
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
think
of
?
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
think
,
sir
,
"
I
answer
,
"
that
I
should
like
to
shy
the
Diamond
into
the
quicksand
,
and
settle
the
question
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
if
you
have
get
the
value
of

stone
in

Mr.

so
,
Betteredge

in
it
go

<EOS>
It
be
curious
to
note
,
when
your
mind
be
anxious
,
how
very
far
in
the
way
of
relief
a
very
small
joke
will
go
.
<EOS>
We
find
a
fund
of
merriment
,
at
the
time
,
in
the
notion
of
make
away
with
Miss
Rachel
's
lawful
property
,
and
get
Mr.
Blake
,
as
executor
,
into
dreadful
trouble
 
though
where
the
merriment
be
,
I
be
quite
at
a
loss
to
discover
now

<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
be
the
first
to
bring
the
talk
back
to
the
talk
's
proper
purpose

He
take
an
envelope
out
of

open
it

to
me
the
paper
inside

<EOS>
up

my

that

die

wickedly

live

convert
me
from
that
opinion

:
I
only
say
it
stagger
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
now
you

I

<EOS>
"
It
seem
hard
to
say
,
sir

"
I
answer
,
"
that
he
die
with
a
horrid
revenge
in
his
heart

a
horrid

alone

<EOS>
Mr.

sit
twist

turn
the

Will
in
his
finger

as
if
he
expect
to
squeeze
the
truth
out

it

manner

<EOS>
He
alter
quite
remarkably
,
at
the

time
.
<EOS>
from
be
brisk
and
bright
,
he
now
become
,
most
unaccountably
,
a
slow
,
solemn
,
and
ponder
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
question
have
two
side
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
an
objective
side

a
subjective
side

which
be
we
to
take
?

<EOS>
He
have
have
a
german
education
as
well
as
a
French
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
two
have
be
in
undisturbed
possession
of
him
(
as
I
suppose
)
up
to
this
time

now
(
as
well
as
I
could
make
out
)
<EOS>
the
other
be
take
its
place

It
be
one
of
my
rule
in

never

notice
what
I
do
not

I
steer
a
middle
course
between
the
objective
side

the
subjective
side

<EOS>
in
plain
English
I
stare
hard
,
and
say
nothing

<EOS>
"
let
's
extract
the
inner
meaning
of
this
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
my
uncle
leave
the
Diamond
to
Rachel
?

why
do
not
he
leave
it
to
my
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
beyond
guessing
,
sir
,
at
any
rate
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
Colonel
Herncastle
know
my
lady
well
enough
to
know
that
she
would
have
refuse
to
accept
any
legacy
that
come
to
her
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
he
know
that
Rachel
may
not
refuse
to
accept
it
,
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
any
young
lady
in
existence

sir
,
who
could
resist
the
temptation
of
accept
such
a
birthday
present
as
the
Moonstone
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
subjective
view
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
It
do
you
great
credit
,
Betteredge
,
to
be
able
to
take
the
subjective
view
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
another
mystery
about
the
Colonel
's
legacy
which
be
not
account
for
yet
.
<EOS>
how
be
we
to
explain
his
only
give
Rachel
her
birthday
present
conditionally
on
her
mother
be
alive
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
slander
a
dead
man
,
sir
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
he
have
purposely
leave
a
legacy
of
trouble
and
danger
to
his
sister
,
by
the
mean
of
her
child
,
it
must
be
a
legacy
make
conditional
on
his
sister
's
be
alive
to
feel
the
vexation
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
that
be
your
interpretation
of
his
motive
,
be
it
?
<EOS>
the
subjective
interpretation
again
!
<EOS>
have
you
ever
be
in
Germany
,
Betteredge

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir

what
be
your
interpretation
,
if
you
please
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
that
the
Colonel
's
object
may
,
quite
possibly
,
have
be
 
not
to
benefit
his
niece

whom
he
have
never
even
see
 
but
to
prove
to
his
sister
that
he
have
die
forgive
her
,
and
to
prove
it
very
prettily
by
mean
of
a
present
make
to
her
child

<EOS>
there
be
a
totally
different
explanation
from
yours
,
Betteredge
,
take
its
rise
in
a
Subjective
-
objective
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
from
all
I
can
see
,
one
interpretation
be
just
as
likely
to
be
right
as
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
have
bring
matter
to
this
pleasant
and
comforting
issue
,
Mr.
Franklin
appear
to
think
that
he
have
complete
all
that
be
require
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
lay
down
flat
on
his
back
on
the
sand
,
and
ask
what
be
to
be
do
next
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
so
clever
,
and
clear
-
headed
(
before
he
begin
to
talk
the
foreign
gibberish
)
,
and
have
so
completely
take
the
lead
in
the
business
up
to
the
present
time
,
that
I
be
quite
unprepared
for
such
a
sudden
change
as
he
now
exhibit
in
this
helpless
lean
upon
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
later
that
I
learn
 
by
assistance
of
Miss
Rachel
,
who
be
the
first
to
make
the
discovery
 
that
these
puzzle
shift
and
transformation
in
Mr.
Franklin
be
due
to
the
effect
on
him
of
his
foreign
training
.
<EOS>
at
the
age
when
we
be
all
of
us
most
apt
to
take
our
colouring
,
in
the
form
of
a
reflection
from
the
colouring
of
other
people
,
he
have
be
send
abroad
,
and
have
be
pass
on
from
one
nation
to
another
,
before
there
be
time
for
any
one
colour
more
than
another
to
settle
itself
on
him
firmly
.
<EOS>
as
a
consequence
of
this
,
he
have
come
back
with
so
many
different
side
to
his
character
,
all
more
or
less
jarring
with
each
other
,
that
he
seem
to
pass
his
life
in
a
state
of
perpetual
contradiction
with
himself
.
<EOS>
He
could
be
a
busy
man
,
and
a
lazy
man
;
cloudy
in
the
head
,
and
clear
in
the
head
;
a
model
of
determination
,
and
a
spectacle
of
helplessness
,
all
together
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
french
side
,
and
his
german
side
,
and
his
italian
side
 
<EOS>
the
original
english
foundation
show
through
,
every
now
and
then
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
here
I
be
,
sorely
transmogrify
,
as
you
see
,
but
there
be
something
of
me
leave
at
the
bottom
of
him
still
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
use
to
remark
that
the
italian
side
of
him
be
uppermost
,
on
those
occasion
when
he
unexpectedly
give
in
,
and
ask
you
in
his
nice
sweet
-
tempered
way
to
take
his
own
responsibility
on
your
shoulder
.
<EOS>
You
will
do
him
no
injustice
,
I
think
,
if
you
conclude
that
the
italian
side
of
him
be
uppermost
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
it
your
business
,
sir
,
"
I
ask
,
"
to
know
what
to
do
next
?
<EOS>
surely
it
can
not
be
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
do
not
appear
to
see
the
force
of
my
question
 
not
be
in
a
position
,
at
the
time
,
to
see
anything
but
the
sky
over
his
head

I
do
not

to
alarm
my
aunt
without
reason

he
say
.

I
do
not
want

leave

what

needful
warning

you
be
in
my
place

tell
me

in
one
word

what
would
you
do

<EOS>
in
one
word
,
I
tell
him
:
"
wait

<EOS>
"
with
all
my
heart

"
say
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
how
long
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
proceed
to
explain
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
I
understand
it
,
sir

I
say
,
"
somebody
be
bind

put
this
plaguy
Diamond

it

another

have
get
close
on
four
week
before
us

's
wait

see
what
happen
in

time

's
warn
my

"
  
<EOS>
"
Perfect
,
Betteredge
,
as
far
as
it
go

"
say
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
but
between
this
and
the
birthday
,
what
be
to
be
do
with
the
Diamond
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
your
father
do
with
it
,
to
be
sure
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Your
father
put
it
in
the
safe
keeping
of
a
bank
in
London
.
<EOS>
You
put
in
the
safe
keeping
of
the
bank
at
Frizinghall
.
"
<EOS>
(
Frizinghall
be
our
near
town
,
and
the
Bank
of
England
be
not
safe
than
the
bank
there
.
)
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
you
,
sir
,
"
I
add
,
"
I
would
ride
straight
away
with
it
to
Frizinghall
before
the
lady
come
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
do
something
 
and
,
what
be
more
,
of
do
that
something
on
a
horse
 
bring
Mr.
Franklin
up
like
lightne
from
the
flat
of
his
back
.
<EOS>
He
spring
to
his
foot
,
and
pull
me
up
,
without
ceremony
,
on
to
mine
.
"
<EOS>
Betteredge
,
you
be
worth
your
weight
in
gold
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
come
along
,
and
saddle
the
good
horse
in
the
stable
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
(
God
bless
it
!
)
<EOS>
be
the
original
english
foundation
of
him
show
through
all
the
foreign
varnish
at
last
!
<EOS>
here
be
the
Master
Franklin
I
remember
,
come
out
again
in
the
good
old
way
at
the
prospect
of
a
ride
,
and
remind
me
of
the
good
old
time
!
<EOS>
saddle
a
horse
for
him
?
<EOS>
I
would
have
saddle
a
dozen
horse
,
if
he
could
only
have
ride
them
all
!
  
<EOS>
We
go
back
to
the
house
in
a
hurry
;
we
have
the
fleet
horse
in
the
stable
saddle
in
a
hurry
;
and
Mr.
Franklin
rattle
off
in
a
hurry
,
to
lodge
the
cursed
Diamond
once
more
in
the
strong
-
room
of
a
bank
.
<EOS>
when
I
hear
the
last
of
his
horse
's
hoofs
on
the
drive
,
and
when
I
turn
about
in
the
yard
and
find
I
be
alone
again
,
I
feel
half
inclined
to
ask
myself
if
I
have
not
wake
up
from
a
dream
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
be
in
this
bewilder
frame
of
mind
,
sorely
need
a
little
quiet
time
by
myself
to
put
me
right
again
,
my
daughter
Penelope
get
in
my
way
(
just
as
her
late
mother
use
to
get
in
my
way
on
the
stair
)
,
and
instantly
summon
me
to
tell
her
all
that
have
pass
at
the
conference
between
Mr.
Franklin
and
me
.
<EOS>
under
present
circumstance
,
the
one
thing
to
be
do
be
to
clap
the
extinguisher
upon
Penelope
's
curiosity
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
reply
that
Mr.
Franklin
and
I
have
both
talk
of
foreign
politic
,
till
we
could
talk
no
longer
,
and
have
then
mutually
fallen
asleep
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
try
that
sort
of
answer
when
your
wife
or
your
daughter
next
worry
you
with
an
awkward
question
at
an
awkward
time
,
and
depend
on
the
natural
sweetness
of
woman
for
kiss
and
make
it
up
again
at
the
next
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
the
afternoon
wear
on
,
and
my
lady
and
Miss
Rachel
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
needless
to
say
how
astonished
they
be
,
when
they
hear
that
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
have
arrive
,
and
have
go
off
again
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
Needless
also
to
say
,
that
they
ask
awkward
question
directly
,
and
that
the
"
foreign
politic
"
and
the
"
fall
asleep
in
the
sun
"
would
not
serve
a
second
time
over
with
them
.
<EOS>
be
at
the
end
of
my
invention
,
I
say
Mr.
Franklin
's
arrival
by
the
early
train
be
entirely
attributable
to
one
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
freak
.
<EOS>
be
ask
,
upon
that
,
whether
his
gallop
off
again
on
horseback
be
another
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
freak
,
I
say
,
"
yes
,
it
be
;
"
and
slip
out
of
it
 
<EOS>
I
think
very
cleverly
 
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
have
get
over
my
difficulty
with
the
lady
,
I
find
more
difficulty
wait
for
me
when
I
go
back
to
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
in
come
Penelope
 
with
the
natural
sweetness
of
woman
 
to
kiss
and
make
it
up
again
;
and
 
with
the
natural
curiosity
of
woman
 
to
ask
another
question
.
<EOS>
this
time
she
only
want
me
to
tell
her
what
be
the
matter
with
our
second
housemaid
,
Rosanna
Spearman
.
  
<EOS>
after
leave
Mr.
Franklin
and
me
at
the
Shivering
Sand
,
Rosanna
,
it
appear
,
have
return
to
the
house
in
a
very
unaccountable
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
She
have
turn
(
if
Penelope
be
to
be
believe
)
<EOS>
all
the
colour
of
the
rainbow
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
merry
without
reason
,
and
sad
without
reason
.
<EOS>
in
one
breath
she
ask
hundred
of
question
about
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
and
in
another
breath
she
have
be
angry
with
Penelope
for
presume
to
suppose
that
a
strange
gentleman
could
possess
any
interest
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
surprised
,
smile
,
and
scribble
Mr.
Franklin
's
name
inside
her
workbox
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
surprise
again
,
cry
and
look
at
her
deform
shoulder
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
have
she
and
Mr.
Franklin
know
anything
of
each
other
before
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
quite
impossible
!
<EOS>
have
they
hear
anything
of
each
other
?
<EOS>
impossible
again
!
<EOS>
I
could
speak
to
Mr.
Franklin
's
astonishment
as
genuine
,
when
he
see
how
the
girl
stare
at
him
.
<EOS>
Penelope
could
speak
to
the
girl
's
inquisitiveness
as
genuine
,
when
she
ask
question
about
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
the
conference
between
us
,
conduct
in
this
way
,
be
tiresome
enough
,
until
my
daughter
suddenly
end
it
by
burst
out
with
what
I
think
the
most
monstrous
supposition
I
have
ever
hear
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
!
<EOS>
"
say
Penelope
,
quite
seriously
,
"
there
be
only
one
explanation
of
it
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
have
fall
in
love
with
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
at
first
sight
!
"
  
<EOS>
You
have
hear
of
beautiful
young
lady
fall
in
love
at
first
sight
,
and
have
think
it
natural
enough
.
<EOS>
but
a
housemaid
out
of
a
reformatory
,
with
a
plain
face
and
a
deform
shoulder
,
fall
in
love
,
at
first
sight
,
with
a
gentleman
who
come
on
a
visit
to
her
mistress
's
house
,
match
me
that
,
in
the
way
of
an
absurdity
,
out
of
any
story
-
book
in
Christendom
,
if
you
can
!
<EOS>
I
laugh
till
the
tear
roll
down
my
cheek
.
<EOS>
Penelope
resent
my
merriment
,
in
rather
a
strange
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
know
you
cruel
before
,
father
,
"
she
say
,
very
gently
,
and
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
My
girl
's
word
fall
upon
me
like
a
splash
of
cold
water
.
<EOS>
I
be
savage
with
myself
,
for
feel
uneasy
in
myself
the
moment
she
have
speak
them
 
<EOS>
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
We
will
change
the
subject
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
I
drift
into
write
about
it
;
and
not
without
reason
,
as
you
will
see
when
we
have
go
on
together
a
little
long
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
come
,
and
the
dressing
-
bell
for
dinner
rang
,
before
Mr.
Franklin
return
from
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
I
take
his
hot
water
up
to
his
room
myself
,
expect
to
hear
,
after
this
extraordinary
delay
,
that
something
have
happen
.
<EOS>
to
my
great
disappointment
(
and
no
doubt
to
yours
also
)
,
nothing
have
happen
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
meet
with
the
Indians
,
either
go
or
return
.
<EOS>
He
have
deposit
the
Moonstone
in
the
bank
 
describe
it
merely
as
a
valuable
of
great
price
 
and
he
have
get
the
receipt
for
it
safe
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
go
down
-
stair
,
feel
that
this
be
rather
a
flat
ending
,
after
all
our
excitement
about
the
Diamond
earlier
in
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
how
the
meeting
between
Mr.
Franklin
and
his
aunt
and
cousin
go
off
,
be
more
than
I
can
tell
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
give
something
to
have
wait
at
table
that
day
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
my
position
in
the
household
,
wait
at
dinner
(
except
on
high
family
festival
)
be
let
down
my
dignity
in
the
eye
of
the
other
servant
 
a
thing
which
my
lady
consider
me
quite
prone
enough
to
do
already
,
without
seek
occasion
for
it
.
<EOS>
the
news
bring
to
me
from
the
upper
region
,
that
evening
,
come
from
Penelope
and
the
footman
.
<EOS>
Penelope
mention
that
she
have
never
know
Miss
Rachel
so
particular
about
the
dressing
of
her
hair
,
and
have
never
see
her
look
so
bright
and
pretty
as
she
do
when
she
go
down
to
meet
Mr.
Franklin
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
the
footman
's
report
be
,
that
the
preservation
of
a
respectful
composure
in
the
presence
of
his
better
,
and
the
waiting
on
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
at
dinner
,
be
two
of
the
hard
thing
to
reconcile
with
each
other
that
have
ever
try
his
training
in
service
.
<EOS>
later
in
the
evening
,
we
hear
them
singe
and
play
duet
,
Mr.
Franklin
pipe
high
,
Miss
Rachel
pipe
higher
,
and
my
lady
,
on
the
piano
,
<EOS>
follow
them
as
it
be
over
hedge
and
ditch
,
and
see
them
safe
through
it
in
a
manner
most
wonderful
and
pleasant
to
hear
through
the
open
window
,
on
the
terrace
at
night
.
<EOS>
later
still
,
I
go
to
Mr.
Franklin
in
the
smoking
-
room
,
with
the
soda
-
water
and
brandy
,
and
find
that
Miss
Rachel
have
put
the
Diamond
clean
out
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
the
most
charming
girl
I
have
see
since
I
come
back
to
England
!
"
be
all
I
could
extract
from
him
,
when
I
endeavour
to
lead
the
conversation
to
more
serious
thing
.
  
<EOS>
towards
midnight
,
I
go
round
the
house
to
lock
up
,
accompany
by
my
second
in
command
<EOS>
(
Samuel
,
the
footman
)
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
when
all
the
door
be
make
fast
,
except
the
side
door
that
open
on
the
terrace
,
I
send
Samuel
to
bed
,
and
step
out
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
before
I
too
go
to
bed
in
my
turn
.
  
<EOS>
the
night
be
still
and
close
,
and
the
moon
be
at
the
full
in
the
heaven
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
silent
out
of
door
,
that
I
hear
from
time
to
time
,
very
faint
and
low
,
the
fall
of
the
sea
,
as
the
ground
-
swell
heave
it
in
on
the
sand
-
bank
near
the
mouth
of
our
little
bay
.
<EOS>
as
the
house
stand
,
the
terrace
side
be
the
dark
side
;
but
the
broad
moonlight
show
fair
on
the
gravel
walk
that
run
along
the
next
side
to
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
look
this
way
,
after
look
up
at
the
sky
,
I
see
the
shadow
of
a
person
in
the
moonlight
throw
forward
from
behind
the
corner
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
be
old
and
sly
,
I
forbore
to
call
out
;
but
be
also
,
unfortunately
,
old
and
heavy
,
my
foot
betray
me
on
the
gravel
.
<EOS>
before
I
could
steal
suddenly
round
the
corner
,
as
I
have
propose
,
I
hear
light
foot
than
mine
 
and
more
than
one
pair
of
them
as
I
think
 
retreat
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
I
have
get
to
the
corner
,
the
trespasser
,
whoever
they
be
,
have
run
into
the
shrubbery
at
the
off
side
of
the
walk
,
and
be
hide
from
sight
among
the
thick
tree
and
bush
in
that
part
of
the
ground
.
<EOS>
from
the
shrubbery
,
they
could
easily
make
their
way
,
over
our
fence
into
the
road
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
forty
year
young
,
I
may
have
have
a
chance
of
catch
them
before
they
get
clear
of
our
premise
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
go
back
to
set
a
-
go
a
young
pair
of
leg
than
mine
.
<EOS>
without
disturb
anybody
,
Samuel
and
I
get
a
couple
of
gun
,
and
go
all
round
the
house
and
through
the
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
have
make
sure
that
no
person
be
lurk
about
anywhere
in
our
ground
,
we
turn
back
.
<EOS>
pass
over
the
walk
where
I
have
see
the
shadow
,
I
now
notice
,
for
the
first
time
,
a
little
bright
object
,
lie
on
the
clean
gravel
,
under
the
light
of
the
moon
.
<EOS>
pick
the
object
up
,
I
discover
it
be
a
small
bottle
,
contain
a
thick
sweet
-
smell
liquor
,
as
black
as
ink
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
to
Samuel
.
<EOS>
but
,
remember
what
Penelope
have
tell
me
about
the
juggler
,
and
the
pouring
of
the
little
pool
of
ink
into
the
palm
of
the
boy
's
hand
,
I
instantly
suspect
that
I
have
disturb
the
three
Indians
,
lurk
about
the
house
,
and
bent
,
in
their
heathenish
way
,
on
discover
the
whereabouts
of
the
Diamond
that
night
.
    
<EOS>
here
,
for
one
moment
,
I
find
it
necessary
to
call
a
halt
.
  
<EOS>
on
summon
up
my
own
recollection
 
and
on
get
Penelope
to
help
me
,
by
consult
her
journal
 
I
find
that
we
may
pass
pretty
rapidly
over
the
interval
between
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
arrival
and
Miss
Rachel
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
for
the
great
part
of
that
time
the
day
pass
,
and
bring
nothing
with
them
worth
recording
.
<EOS>
with
your
good
leave
,
then
,
and
with
Penelope
's
help
,
I
shall
notice
certain
date
only
in
this
place
;
reserve
to
myself
to
tell
the
story
day
by
day
,
once
more
,
as
soon
as
we
get
to
the
time
when
the
business
of
the
Moonstone
become
the
chief
business
of
everybody
in
our
house
.
  
<EOS>
this
say
,
we
may
now
go
on
again
 
beginning
,
of
course
,
with
the
bottle
of
sweet
-
smell
ink
which
I
find
on
the
gravel
walk
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
(
the
morning
of
the
twenty
-
sixth
)
<EOS>
I
show
Mr.
Franklin
this
article
of
jugglery
,
and
tell
him
what
I
have
already
tell
you
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
be
,
not
only
that
the
Indians
have
be
lurk
about
after
the
Diamond
,
but
also
that
they
be
actually
foolish
enough
to
believe
in
their
own
magic
 
mean
<EOS>
thereby
the
making
of
sign
on
a
boy
's
head
,
and
the
pouring
of
ink
into
a
boy
's
hand
,
and
then
expect
him
to
see
person
and
thing
beyond
the
reach
of
human
vision
.
<EOS>
in
our
country
,
as
well
as
in
the
East
,
Mr.
Franklin
inform
me
,
there
be
people
who
practise
this
curious
hocus
-
pocus
(
without
the
ink
,
however
)
;
and
who
call
it
by
a
french
name
,
signify
something
like
brightness
of
sight
.
<EOS>
"
depend
upon
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
the
Indians
take
it
for
grant
that
we
should
keep
the
Diamond
here
;
and
they
bring
their
clairvoyant
boy
to
show
them
the
way
to
it
,
if
they
succeed
in
get
into
the
house
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
they
will
try
again
,
sir
?
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
depend
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
on
what
the
boy
can
really
do
.
<EOS>
if
he
can
see
the
Diamond
through
the
iron
safe
of
the
bank
at
Frizinghall
,
we
shall
be
trouble
with
no
more
visit
from
the
Indians
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
if
he
can
not
,
we
shall
have
another
chance
of
catch
them
in
the
shrubbery
,
before
many
more
night
be
over
our
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wait
pretty
confidently
for
that
latter
chance
;
but
,
strange
to
relate
,
it
never
come
.
  
<EOS>
whether
the
juggler
hear
,
in
the
town
,
of
Mr.
Franklin
have
be
see
at
the
bank
,
and
draw
their
conclusion
accordingly
;
or
whether
the
boy
really
do
see
the
Diamond
where
the
Diamond
be
now
lodge
(
which
I
,
for
one
,
flatly
disbelieve
)
;
or
whether
,
after
all
,
it
be
a
mere
effect
of
chance
,
this
at
any
rate
be
the
plain
truth
 
not
the
ghost
of
an
Indian
come
near
the
house
again
,
through
the
week
that
pass
before
Miss
Rachel
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
the
juggler
remain
in
and
about
the
town
ply
their
trade
;
and
Mr.
Franklin
and
I
remain
wait
to
see
what
may
happen
,
and
resolute
not
to
put
the
rogue
on
their
guard
by
show
our
suspicion
of
them
too
soon
.
<EOS>
with
this
report
of
the
proceeding
on
either
side
,
end
all
that
I
have
to
say
about
the
Indians
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
twenty
-
ninth
of
the
month
,
Miss
Rachel
and
Mr.
Franklin
hit
on
a
new
method
of
work
their
way
together
through
the
time
which
may
otherwise
have
hang
heavy
on
their
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
reason
for
take
particular
notice
here
of
the
occupation
that
amuse
them
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
it
have
a
bearing
on
something
that
be
still
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Gentlefolks
in
general
have
a
very
awkward
rock
ahead
in
life
 
<EOS>
the
rock
ahead
of
their
own
idleness
.
<EOS>
Their
life
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
pass
in
look
about
them
for
something
to
do
,
it
be
curious
to
see
 
especially
when
their
taste
be
of
what
be
call
the
intellectual
sort
 
<EOS>
how
often
they
drift
blindfold
into
some
nasty
pursuit
.
<EOS>
nine
time
out
of
ten
they
take
to
torture
something
,
or
to
spoil
something
 
<EOS>
and
they
firmly
believe
they
be
improve
their
mind
,
when
the
plain
truth
be
,
they
be
only
make
a
mess
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
them
(
lady
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
as
well
as
gentleman
)
<EOS>
go
out
,
day
after
day
,
for
example
,
with
empty
pill
-
box
,
and
catch
newts
,
and
beetle
,
and
spider
,
and
frog
,
and
come
home
and
stick
pin
through
the
miserable
wretch
,
or
cut
them
up
,
without
a
pang
of
remorse
,
into
little
piece
.
<EOS>
You
see
my
young
master
,
or
my
young
mistress
,
pore
over
one
of
their
spider
'
inside
with
a
magnifying
-
glass
;
or
you
meet
one
of
their
frog
walk
downstairs
without
his
head
 
and
when
you
wonder
what
this
cruel
nastiness
mean
,
you
be
tell
that
it
mean
a
taste
in
my
young
master
or
my
young
mistress
for
natural
history
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
again
,
you
see
them
occupy
for
hour
together
in
spoil
a
pretty
flower
with
pointed
instrument
,
out
of
a
stupid
curiosity
to
know
what
the
flower
be
make
of
.
<EOS>
be
its
colour
any
prettier
,
or
its
scent
any
sweeter
,
when
you
do
know
?
<EOS>
but
there
!
<EOS>
the
poor
soul
must
get
through
the
time
,
you
see
 
they
must
get
through
the
time
.
<EOS>
You
dabble
in
nasty
mud
,
and
make
pie
,
when
you
be
a
child
;
and
you
dabble
in
nasty
science
,
and
dissect
spider
,
and
spoil
flower
,
when
you
grow
up
.
<EOS>
in
the
one
case
and
in
the
other
,
the
secret
of
it
be
,
that
you
have
get
nothing
to
think
of
in
your
poor
empty
head
,
and
nothing
to
do
with
your
poor
idle
hand
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
end
in
your
spoil
canvas
with
paint
,
and
make
a
smell
in
the
house
;
or
in
keep
tadpole
in
a
glass
box
full
of
dirty
water
,
and
turn
everybody
's
stomach
in
the
house
;
or
in
chip
off
bit
of
stone
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
,
and
drop
grit
into
all
the
victual
in
the
house
;
or
in
stain
your
finger
in
the
pursuit
of
photography
,
and
do
justice
without
mercy
on
everybody
's
face
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
often
fall
heavy
enough
,
no
doubt
,
on
people
who
be
really
oblige
to
get
their
living
,
to
be
force
to
work
for
the
clothe
that
cover
them
,
the
roof
that
shelter
them
,
and
the
food
that
keep
them
go
.
<EOS>
but
compare
the
hard
day
's
work
you
ever
do
with
the
idleness
that
split
flower
and
poke
its
way
into
spider
'
stomach
,
and
thank
your
star
that
your
head
have
get
something
it
MUST
think
of
,
and
your
hand
something
that
they
MUST
do
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Mr.
Franklin
and
Miss
Rachel
,
they
torture
nothing
,
I
be
glad
to
say
.
<EOS>
They
simply
confine
themselves
to
make
a
mess
;
and
all
they
spoilt
,
to
do
them
justice
,
be
the
panelling
of
a
door
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
universal
genius
,
dabble
in
everything
,
dabble
in
what
he
call
"
decorative
painting
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
invent
,
he
inform
us
,
a
new
mixture
to
moisten
paint
with
,
which
he
describe
as
a
"
vehicle
.
<EOS>
"
what
it
be
make
of
,
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
what
it
do
,
I
can
tell
you
in
two
word
 
it
stank
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
be
wild
<EOS>
to
try
her
hand
at
the
new
process
,
Mr.
Franklin
send
to
London
for
the
material
;
mix
them
up
,
with
accompaniment
of
a
smell
which
make
the
very
dog
sneeze
when
they
come
into
the
room
;
put
an
apron
and
a
bib
over
Miss
Rachel
's
gown
,
and
set
her
to
work
decorate
her
own
little
sitting
-
room
 
call
,
for
want
of
English
to
name
it
in
,
her
"
boudoir
.
"
<EOS>
They
begin
with
the
inside
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
scrape
off
all
the
nice
varnish
with
pumice
-
stone
,
and
make
what
he
describe
as
a
surface
to
work
on
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
then
cover
the
surface
,
under
his
direction
and
with
his
help
,
with
pattern
and
device
 
griffin
,
bird
,
flower
,
cupid
,
and
such
like
 
copy
from
design
make
by
a
famous
italian
painter
,
whose
name
escape
me
:
the
one
,
I
mean
,
who
stock
the
world
with
Virgin
Maries
,
and
have
a
sweetheart
at
the
baker
's
.
<EOS>
view
as
work
,
this
decoration
be
slow
to
do
,
and
dirty
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
but
our
young
lady
and
gentleman
never
seem
to
tire
of
it
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
not
ride
,
or
see
company
,
or
take
their
meal
,
or
pipe
their
song
,
there
they
be
with
their
head
together
,
as
busy
as
bee
,
spoil
the
door
.
<EOS>
who
be
the
poet
who
say
that
Satan
find
some
mischief
still
for
idle
hand
to
do
?
<EOS>
if
he
have
occupy
my
place
in
the
family
,
and
have
see
Miss
Rachel
with
her
brush
,
and
Mr.
Franklin
with
his
vehicle
,
he
could
have
write
nothing
true
of
either
of
them
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
date
worthy
of
notice
be
Sunday
the
fourth
of
June
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
evening
we
,
in
the
servant
'
hall
,
debate
a
domestic
question
for
the
first
time
,
which
,
like
the
decoration
of
the
door
,
have
its
bearing
on
something
that
be
still
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
see
the
pleasure
which
Mr.
Franklin
and
Miss
Rachel
take
in
each
other
's
society
,
and
note
what
a
pretty
match
they
be
in
all
personal
respect
,
we
naturally
speculate
on
the
chance
of
their
put
their
head
together
with
other
object
in
view
besides
the
ornamenting
of
a
door
.
<EOS>
some
of
us
say
there
would
be
a
wedding
in
the
house
before
the
summer
be
over
.
<EOS>
other
(
lead
by
me
)
admit
it
be
likely
enough
Miss
Rachel
may
be
marry
;
but
we
doubt
(
for
reason
which
will
presently
appear
)
whether
her
bridegroom
would
be
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
that
Mr.
Franklin
be
in
love
,
on
his
side
,
nobody
who
see
and
hear
him
could
doubt
.
<EOS>
the
difficulty
be
to
fathom
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
let
me
do
myself
the
honour
of
make
you
acquaint
with
her
;
after
which
,
I
will
leave
you
to
fathom
for
yourself
 
if
you
can
.
  
<EOS>
My
young
lady
's
eighteenth
birthday
be
the
birthday
now
come
,
on
the
twenty
-
first
of
June
.
<EOS>
if
you
happen
to
like
dark
woman
(
who
,
I
be
inform
,
have
go
out
of
fashion
latterly
in
the
gay
world
)
,
and
if
you
have
no
particular
prejudice
in
favour
of
size
,
I
answer
for
Miss
Rachel
as
one
of
the
pretty
girl
your
eye
ever
look
on
.
<EOS>
She
be
small
and
slim
,
but
all
in
fine
proportion
from
top
to
toe
.
<EOS>
to
see
her
sit
down
,
to
see
her
get
up
,
and
specially
to
see
her
walk
,
be
enough
to
satisfy
any
man
in
his
sense
that
the
grace
of
her
figure
(
if
you
will
pardon
me
the
expression
)
be
in
her
flesh
and
not
in
her
clothe
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
be
the
black
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
match
her
hair
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
be
not
quite
large
enough
,
I
admit
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
and
chin
be
(
to
quote
Mr.
Franklin
)
morsel
for
the
god
;
and
her
complexion
(
on
the
same
undeniable
authority
)
be
as
warm
as
the
sun
itself
,
with
this
great
advantage
over
the
sun
,
that
it
be
always
in
nice
order
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
add
to
the
foregoing
that
she
carry
her
head
as
upright
as
a
dart
,
in
a
dashing
,
spirit
,
thoroughbred
way
 
that
she
have
a
clear
voice
,
with
a
ring
of
the
right
metal
in
it
,
and
a
smile
that
begin
very
prettily
in
her
eye
before
it
get
to
her
lip
 
<EOS>
and
there
behold
the
portrait
of
her
,
to
the
good
of
my
painting
,
as
large
as
life
!
  
<EOS>
and
what
about
her
disposition
next
?
<EOS>
have
this
charming
creature
no
fault
?
<EOS>
She
have
just
as
many
fault
as
you
have
,
madam
 
<EOS>
neither
more
nor
less
.
  
<EOS>
to
put
it
seriously
,
my
dear
pretty
Miss
Rachel
,
possess
a
host
of
grace
and
attraction
,
have
one
defect
,
which
strict
impartiality
compel
me
to
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
She
be
unlike
most
other
girl
of
her
age
,
in
this
 
that
she
have
idea
of
her
own
,
and
be
stiff
-
necked
enough
to
set
the
fashion
themselves
at
defiance
,
if
the
fashion
do
not
suit
her
view
.
<EOS>
in
trifle
,
this
independence
of
her
be
all
well
enough
;
but
in
matter
of
importance
,
it
carry
her
(
as
my
lady
think
,
and
as
I
think
)
too
far
.
<EOS>
She
judge
for
herself
,
as
few
woman
of
twice
her
age
judge
in
general
;
never
ask
your
advice
;
never
tell
you
beforehand
what
she
be
go
to
do
;
never
come
with
secret
and
confidence
to
anybody
,
from
her
mother
downwards
.
<EOS>
in
little
thing
and
great
,
with
people
she
love
,
and
people
she
hate
(
and
she
do
both
with
equal
heartiness
)
,
Miss
Rachel
always
go
on
a
way
of
her
own
,
sufficient
for
herself
in
the
joy
and
sorrow
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
I
have
hear
my
lady
say
,
"
Rachel
's
good
friend
and
Rachel
's
bad
enemy
be
,
one
and
the
other
 
Rachel
herself
.
"
  
<EOS>
add
one
thing
more
to
this
,
and
I
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
her
secrecy
,
and
self
-
will
,
there
be
not
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
anything
false
in
her
.
<EOS>
I
never
remember
her
break
her
word
;
I
never
remember
her
say
<EOS>
no
,
and
mean
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
can
call
to
mind
,
in
her
childhood
,
more
than
one
occasion
when
the
good
little
soul
take
the
blame
,
and
suffer
the
punishment
,
for
some
fault
commit
by
a
playfellow
whom
she
love
.
<EOS>
nobody
ever
know
her
to
confess
to
it
,
when
the
thing
be
find
out
,
and
she
be
charge
with
it
afterwards
.
<EOS>
but
nobody
ever
know
her
to
lie
about
it
,
either
.
<EOS>
She
look
you
straight
in
the
face
,
and
shake
her
little
saucy
head
,
and
say
plainly
,
"
I
will
not
tell
you
!
"
<EOS>
punish
again
for
this
,
she
would
own
to
be
sorry
for
say
"
will
not
;
"
but
,
bread
and
water
notwithstanding
,
she
never
tell
you
.
<EOS>
self
-
will
 
devilish
self
-
willed
<EOS>
sometimes
 
I
grant
;
but
the
fine
creature
,
nevertheless
,
that
ever
walk
the
way
of
this
low
world
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
think
you
see
a
certain
contradiction
here
?
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
a
word
in
your
ear

an
invitation
from
my
mistress
be
send
to
a
gentleman
in
London
,
to
come

keep
Miss

<EOS>
this
be
the
fortunate
individual
on
whom
I
believe
her
heart
to
be
privately
set
!
<EOS>
like
Mr.
Franklin
,
he
be
a
cousin
of
her
.
<EOS>
His
name
be
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
's
second
sister
(
do
not
be
alarm
;
we
be
not
go
very
deep
into
family
matter
this
time
)
 
<EOS>
my
lady
's
second
sister
,
I
say
,
have
a
disappointment
in
love
;
and
take
a
husband
afterwards
,
on
the
neck
or
nothing
principle
,
make
what
they
call
a
misalliance
.
<EOS>
there
be
terrible
work
in
the
family
when
the
honourable
Caroline
insist
on
marry
plain
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
the
banker
at
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
rich
and
very
respectable
,
and
he
beget
a
prodigious
large
family
 
all
in
his
favour
,
so
far
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
presume
to
raise
himself
from
a
low
station
in
the
world
 
and
that
be
against
him
.
<EOS>
however
,
Time
and
the
progress
of
modern
enlightenment
put
thing
right
;
and
the
misalliance
pass
muster
very
well
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
get
liberal
now
;
and
(
provide
you
can
scratch
me
,
if
I
scratch
you
)
<EOS>
what
do
I
care
,
in
or
out
of
Parliament
,
whether
you
be
a
Dustman
or
a
Duke
?
<EOS>
that
be
the
modern
way
of
look
at
it
 
<EOS>
and
I
keep
up
with
the
modern
way
.
<EOS>
the
Ablewhites
live
in
a
fine
house
and
ground
,
a
little
out
of
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
very
worthy
people
,
and
greatly
respect
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
be
much
troubled
with
them
in
these
page
 
except
Mr.
Godfrey
,
who
be
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
second
son
,
and
who
must
take
his
proper
place
here
,
if
you
please
,
for
Miss
Rachel
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
his
brightness
and
cleverness
and
general
good
quality
,
Mr.
Franklin
's
chance
of
top
Mr.
Godfrey
in
our
young
lady
's
estimation
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
very
poor
chance
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
Mr.
Godfrey
be
,
in
point
of
size
,
the
fine
man
by
far
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
He
stand
over
six
foot
high
;
he
have
a
beautiful
red
and
white
colour
;
a
smooth
round
face
,
shave
as
bare
as
your
hand
;
and
a
head
of
lovely
long
flaxen
hair
,
fall
negligently
over
the
poll
of
his
neck
.
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
try
to
give
you
this
personal
description
of
him
?
<EOS>
if
you
ever
subscribe
to
a
Ladies
'
Charity
in
London
,
you
know
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
barrister
by
profession
;
a
lady
'
man
by
temperament
;
and
a
good
Samaritan
by
choice
.
<EOS>
female
benevolence
and
female
destitution
could
do
nothing
without
him
.
<EOS>
maternal
society
for
confine
poor
woman
;
Magdalen
society
for

;
strong

themselves
;
 
he
be
vice

<EOS>
wherever
there

round
it
in
council
there
be
Mr.
Godfrey
at
the
bottom

keep
the
temper
of
the
committee
,
and
lead
the
dear
creature
along
the
thorny
way
of
business
,
hat
in
hand
.
<EOS>
I
do
suppose
this
be
the
most
accomplished
philanthropist
(
on
a
small
independence
)
that
England
ever
produce
.
<EOS>
as
a
speaker
at
charitable
meeting
the
like
of
him
for
draw
your
tear
and
your
money
be
not
easy
to
find

<EOS>
He

quite
a
public
character

<EOS>
crowd

<EOS>
ditto

<EOS>
and
with
all
this
,
the
sweetest
temper
person
(
I
allude
to
Mr.
Godfrey
)
 
the
simple
and
pleasantest
and
easy

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
and

<EOS>
what
chance
have
Mr.
Franklin
 
<EOS>
what
chance
have
anybody
of
average
reputation
and
capacity
 
against
such
a
man
as
this
?
  
<EOS>
on
the
fourteenth
,
come
Mr.
Godfrey
's
answer
.
  
<EOS>
He
accept
my
mistress
's
invitation
,
from
the
Wednesday
of
the
birthday
to
the
evening
of
Friday
 
when
his
duty
to
the
Ladies
'
Charities
would
oblige
him
to
return
to
town
.
<EOS>
He
also
enclose
a
copy
of
verse
on
what
he
elegantly
call
his
cousin
's
"
natal
day
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
,
I
be
inform
,
join
Mr.
Franklin
in
make
fun
of
the
verse
at
dinner
;
and
Penelope
,
who
be
all
on
Mr.
Franklin
's
side
,
ask
me
,
in
great
triumph
,
what
I
think
of
that
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
have
lead
you
off
on
a
false
scent
,
my
dear
,
"
I
reply
;
"
but
my
nose
be
not
so
easily
mystified
.
<EOS>
wait
till
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
verse
be
follow
by
Mr.
Ablewhite
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
daughter
reply
,
that
Mr.
Franklin
may
strike
in
,
and
try
his
luck
,
before
the
verse
be
follow
by
the
poet
.
<EOS>
in
favour
of
this
view
,
I
must
acknowledge
that
Mr.
Franklin
leave
no
chance
untried
of
win
Miss
Rachel
's
good
grace
.
  
<EOS>
though
one
of
the
most
inveterate
smoker
I
ever
meet
with
,
he
give
up
his
cigar
,
because
she
say
,
one
day
,
she
hate
the
stale
smell
of
it
in
his
clothe
.
<EOS>
He
sleep
so
badly
,
after
this
effort
of
self
-
denial
,
for
want
of
the
composing
effect
of
the
tobacco
to
which
he
be
use
,
and
come
down
morning
after
morning
look
so
haggard
and
wear
,
that
Miss
Rachel
herself
beg
him
to
take
to
his
cigar
again
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
he
would
take
to
nothing
again
that
could
cause
her
a
moment
's
annoyance
;
he
would
fight
it
out
resolutely
,
and
get
back
his
sleep
,
sooner
or
later
,
by
main
force
of
patience
in
wait
for
it
.
<EOS>
such
devotion
as
this
,
you
may
say
(
as
some
of
them
say
downstairs
)
,
could
never
fail
of
produce
the
right
effect
on
Miss
Rachel
 
back
up
,
too
,
as
it
be
,
by
the
decorate
work
every
day
on
the
door
.
<EOS>
all
very
well
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
a
photograph
of
Mr.
Godfrey
in
her
bed
-
room
;
represent
speak
at
a
public
meeting
,
with
all
his
hair
blow
out
by
the
breath
of
his
own
eloquence
,
and
his
eye
,
most
lovely
,
charm
the
money
out
of
your
pocket
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
that
?
<EOS>
every
morning
 
as
Penelope
herself
own
to
me
 
there
be
the
man
whom
the
woman
could
not
do
without
,
look
on
,
in
effigy
,
while
Miss
Rachel
be
have
her
hair
comb
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
look
on
,
in
reality
,
before
long
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
opinion
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
June
the
sixteenth
bring
an
event
which
make
Mr.
Franklin
's
chance
look
,
to
my
mind
,
a
bad
chance
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
a
strange
gentleman
,
speak
English
with
a
foreign
accent
,
come
that
morning
to
the
house
,
and
ask
to
see
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
on
business
.
<EOS>
the
business
could
not
possibly
have
be
connect
with
the
Diamond
,
for
these
two
reason
 
first
,
that
Mr.
Franklin
tell
me
nothing
about
it
;
secondly
,
that
he
communicate
it
(
when
the
gentleman
have
go
,
as
I
suppose
)
to
my
lady
.
<EOS>
She
probably
hint
something
about
it
next
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
Miss
Rachel
be
report
to
have
say
some
severe
thing
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
at
the
piano
that
evening
,
about
the
people
he
have
live
among
,
and
the
principle
he
have
adopt
in
foreign
part
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
for
the
first
time
,
nothing
be
do
towards
the
decoration
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
some
imprudence
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
on
the
continent
 
with
a
woman
or
a
debt
at
the
bottom
of
it
 
have
follow
him
to
England
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
all
guesswork
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
,
not
only
Mr.
Franklin
,
but
my
lady
too
,
for
a
wonder
,
leave
me
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
seventeenth
,
to
all
appearance
,
the
cloud
pass
away
again
.
<EOS>
They
return
to
their
decorate
work
on
the
door
,
and
seem
to
be
as
good
friend
as
ever
.
<EOS>
if
Penelope
be
to
be
believe
,
Mr.
Franklin
have
seize
the
opportunity
of
the
reconciliation
to
make
an
offer
to
Miss
Rachel
,
and
have
neither
be
accept
nor
refuse
.
<EOS>
My
girl
be
sure
(
from
sign
and
token
which
I
need
not
trouble
you
with
)
that
her
young
mistress
have
fight
Mr.
Franklin
off
by
decline
to
believe
that
he
be
in
earnest
,
and
have
then
secretly
regretted
treat
him
in
that
way
afterwards
.
<EOS>
though
Penelope
be
admit
to
more
familiarity
with
her
young
mistress
than
maid
generally
be
 
for
the
two
have
be
almost
bring
up
together
as
child
 
<EOS>
still
I
know
Miss
Rachel
's
reserve
character
too
well
to
believe
that
she
would
show
her
mind
to
anybody
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
what
my
daughter
tell
me
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
be
,
as
I
suspect
,
more
what
she
wish
than
what
she
really
know
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
nineteenth
another
event
happen
.
<EOS>
We
have
the
doctor
in
the
house
professionally
.
<EOS>
He
be
summon
to
prescribe
for
a
person
whom
I
have
have
occasion
to
present
to
you
in
these
page
 
our
second
housemaid
,
Rosanna
Spearman
.
  
<EOS>
this
poor
girl
 
who
have
puzzle
me
,
as
you
know
already
,
at
the
Shivering
Sand
 
puzzle
me
more
than
once
again
,
in
the
interval
time
of
which
I
be
now
write
.
<EOS>
Penelope
's
notion
that
her
fellow
-
servant
be
in
love
with
Mr.
Franklin
(
which
my
daughter
,
by
my
order
,
keep
strictly
secret
)
seem
to
be
just
as
absurd
as
ever
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
own
that
what
I
myself
see
,
and
what
my
daughter
see
also
,
of
our
second
housemaid
's
conduct
,
begin
to
look
mysterious
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
for
example
,
the
girl
constantly
put
herself
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
way
 
very
slyly
and
quietly
,
but
she
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
take
about
as
much
notice
of
her
as
he
take
of
the
cat
;
it
never
seem
to
occur
to
him
to
waste
a
look
on
Rosanna
's
plain
face
.
<EOS>
the
poor
thing
's
appetite
,
never
much
,
fall
away
dreadfully
;
and
her
eye
in
the
morning
show
plain
sign
of
wake
and
cry
at
night
.
<EOS>
one
day
Penelope
make
an
awkward
discovery
,
which
we
hush
up
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
She
catch
Rosanna
at
Mr.
Franklin
's
dressing
-
table
,
secretly
remove
a
rose
which
Miss
Rachel
have
give
him
to
wear
in
his
button
-
hole
,
and
put
another
rose
like
it
,
of
her
own
picking
,
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
after
that
,
once
or
twice
impudent
to
me
,
when
I
give
her
a
well
-
mean
general
hint
to
be
careful
in
her
conduct
;
and
,
bad
still
<EOS>
,
she
be
not
over
-
respectful
now
,
on
the
few
occasion
when
Miss
Rachel
accidentally
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
notice
the
change
,
and
ask
me
what
I
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
screen
the
girl
by
answer
that
I
think
she
be
out
of
health
;
and
it
end
in
the
doctor
be
send
for
,
as
already
mention
,
on
the
nineteenth
.
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
her
nerve
,
and
doubt
if
she
be
fit
for
service
.
<EOS>
My
lady
offer
to
remove
her
for
change
of
air
to
one
of
our
farm
,
inland
.
<EOS>
She
beg
and
pray
,
with
the
tear
in
her
eye
,
to
be
let
to
stop
;
and
,
in
an
evil
hour
,
I
advise
my
lady
to
try
her
for
a
little
long
.
<EOS>
as
the
event
prove
,
and
as
you
will
soon
see
,
this
be
the
bad
advice
I
could
have
give
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
only
have
look
a
little
way
into
the
future
,
I
would
have
take
Rosanna
Spearman
out
of
the
house
,
then
and
there
,
with
my
own
hand
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
twentieth
,
there
come
a
note
from
Mr.
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
He
have
arrange
to
stop
at
Frizinghall
that
night
,
have
occasion
to
consult
his
father
on
business
.
<EOS>
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
,
he
and
his
two
eld
sister
would
ride
over
to
us
on
horseback
,
in
good
time
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
an
elegant
little
casket
in
China
accompany
the
note
,
present
to
Miss
Rachel
,
with
her
cousin
's
love
and
good
wish
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
have
only
give
her
a
plain
locket
not
worth
half
the
money
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
Penelope
,
nevertheless
 
such
be
the
obstinacy
of
woman
 
still
back
him
to
win
.
  
<EOS>
thank
be
to
Heaven
,
we
have
arrive
at
the
eve
of
the
birthday
at
last
!
<EOS>
You
will
own
,
I
think
,
that
I
have
get
you
over
the
ground
this
time
,
without
much
loitering
by
the
way
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
will
ease
you
with
another
new
chapter
here
 
and
,
what
be
more
,
that
chapter
shall
take
you
straight
into
the
thick
of
the
story

<EOS>
June
twenty
-
first
,
the
day
of
the
birthday
,
be
cloudy
and
unsettle
at
sunrise
,
but
towards
noon
it
clear
up
bravely
.
  
<EOS>
We
,
in
the
servant
'
hall
,
begin
this
happy
anniversary
,
as
usual
,
by
offer
our
little
present
to
Miss
Rachel
,
with
the
regular
speech
deliver
annually
by
me
as
the
chief
.
<EOS>
I
follow
the
plan
adopt
by
the
Queen
in
open
Parliament
 
namely
,
the
plan
of
say
much
the
same
thing
regularly
every
year
.
<EOS>
before
it
be
deliver
,
my
speech
(
like
the
Queen
's
)
be
look
for
as
eagerly
as
if
nothing
of
the
kind
have
ever
be
hear
before
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
deliver
,
and
turn
out
not
to
be
the
novelty
anticipate
,
though
they
grumble
a
little
,
they
look
forward
hopefully
to
something
new
next
year
.
<EOS>
an
easy
people
to
govern
,
in
the
Parliament
and
in
the
Kitchen
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
moral
of
it
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
Mr.
Franklin
and
I
have
a
private
conference
on
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
 
<EOS>
the
time
have
now
come
for
remove
it
from
the
bank
at
Frizinghall
,
and
place
it
in
Miss
Rachel
's
own
hand
.
  
<EOS>
whether
he
have
be
try
to
make
love
to
his
cousin
again
,
and
have
get
a
rebuff
 
or
whether
his
broken
rest
,
night
after
night
,
be
aggravate
the
queer
contradiction
and
uncertainty
in
his
character
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
but
certain
it
be
,
that
Mr.
Franklin
fail
to
show
himself
at
his
good
on
the
morning
of
the
birthday
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
twenty
different
mind
about
the
Diamond
in
as
many
minute
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
stick
fast
by
the
plain
fact
as
we
know
them
.
<EOS>
nothing
have
happen
to
justify
us
in
alarm
my
lady
on
the
subject
of
the
jewel
;
and
nothing
could
alter
the
legal
obligation
that
now
lie
on
Mr.
Franklin
to
put
it
in
his
cousin
's
possession
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
view
of
the
matter
;
and
,
twist
and
turn
it
as
he
may
,
he
be
force
in
the
end
to
make
it
his
view
too
.
<EOS>
We
arrange
that
he
be
to
ride
over
,
after
lunch
,
to
Frizinghall
,
and
bring
the
Diamond
back
,
with
Mr.
Godfrey
and
the
two
young
lady
,
in
all
probability
,
to
keep
him
company
on
the
way
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
this
settle
,
our
young
gentleman
go
back
to
Miss
Rachel
.
  
<EOS>
They
consume
the
whole
morning
,
and
part
of
the
afternoon
,
in
the
everlasting
business
of
decorate
the
door
,
Penelope
stand
by
to
mix
the
colour
,
as
direct
;
and
my
lady
,
as
luncheon
time
draw
near
,
go
in
and
out
of
the
room
,
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
nose
(
for
they
use
a
deal
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
vehicle
that
day
)
,
and
try
vainly
to
get
the
two
artist
away
from
their
work
.
<EOS>
It
be
three
o'clock
before
they
take
off
their
apron
,
and
release
Penelope
(
much
the
bad
for
the
vehicle
)
,
and
clean
themselves
of
their
mess
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
do
what
they
want
 
they
have
finish
the
door
on
the
birthday
,
and
proud
enough
they
be
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
griffin
,
cupid
,
and
so
on
,
be
,
I
must
own
,
most
beautiful
to
behold
;
though
so
many
in
number
,
so
entangle
in
flower
and
device
,
and
so
topsy
-
turvy
in
their
action
and
attitude
,
that
you
feel
them
unpleasantly
in
your
head
for
hour
after
you
have
do
with
the
pleasure
of
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
if
I
add
that
Penelope
end
her
part
of
the
morning
's
work
by
be
sick
in
the
back
-
kitchen
,
it
be
in
no
unfriendly
spirit
towards
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
It
leave
off
stink
when
it
dry
;
and
if
art
require
these
sort
of
sacrifice
 
though
the
girl
be
my
own
daughter
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
let
art
have
them
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
snatch
a
morsel
from
the
luncheon
-
table
,
and
ride
off
to
Frizinghall
 
to
escort
his
cousin
,
as
he
tell
my
lady
.
<EOS>
to
fetch
the
Moonstone
,
as
be
privately
know
to
himself
and
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
high
festival
on
which
I
take
my
place
at
the
side
-
board
,
in
command
of
the
attendance
at
table
,
I
have
plenty
to
occupy
my
mind
while
Mr.
Franklin
be
away
.
<EOS>
have
see
to
the
wine
,
and
review
my
man
and
woman
who
be
to
wait
at
dinner
,
I
retire
to
collect
myself
before
the
company
come
.
<EOS>
a
whiff
of
 
you
know
what
,
and
a
turn
at
a
certain
book
which
I
have
have
occasion
to
mention
in
these
page
,
compose
me
,
body
and
mind
.
<EOS>
I
be
arouse
from
what
I
be
inclined
to
think
must
have
be
,
not
a
nap
,
but
a
reverie
,
by
the
clatter
of
horse
'
hoofs
outside
;
and
,
go
to
the
door
,
receive
a
cavalcade
comprise
Mr.
Franklin
and
his
three
cousin
,
escort
by
one
of
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
groom
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
strike
me
,
strangely
enough
,
as
be
like
Mr.
Franklin
in
this
respect
 
that
he
do
not
seem
to
be
in
his
customary
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
kindly
shake
hand
with
me
as
usual
,
and
be
most
politely
glad
to
see
his
old
friend
Betteredge
wear
so
well
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
sort
of
cloud
over
him
,
which
I
could
not
at
all
account
for
;
and
when
I
ask
how
he
have
find
his
father
in
health
,
he
answer
rather
shortly
,
"
much
as
usual
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
however
,
the
two
Miss
Ablewhites
be
cheerful
enough
for
twenty
,
which
more
than
restore
the
balance
.
<EOS>
They
be
nearly
as
big
as
their
brother
;
spanking
,
yellow
-
haired
,
rosy
lass
,
overflow
with
super
-
abundant
flesh
and
blood
;
burst
from
head
to
foot
with
health
and
spirit
.
<EOS>
the
leg
of
the
poor
horse
tremble
with
carry
them
;
and
when
they
jump
from
their
saddle
(
without
wait
to
be
help
)
,
I
declare
they
bounce
on
the
ground
as
if
they
be
make
of
india
-
rubber
.
<EOS>
everything
the
Miss
Ablewhites
say
begin
with
a
large
o
;
everything
they
do
be
do
with
a
bang
;
and
they
giggle
and
scream
,
in
season
and
out
of
season
,
on
the
small
provocation
.
<EOS>
bouncer
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
call
them
.
  
<EOS>
under
cover
of
the
noise
make
by
the
young
lady
,
I
have
an
opportunity
of
say
a
private
word
to
Mr.
Franklin
in
the
hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
get
the
Diamond
safe
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
nod
,
and
tap
the
breast
-
pocket
of
his
coat
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
see
anything
of
the
Indians
?
"
  
"
not
a
glimpse
.
"
<EOS>
with
that
answer
,
he
ask
for
my
lady
,
and
,
hear
she
be
in
the
small
drawing
-
room
,
go
there
straight
.
<EOS>
the
bell
ring
,
before
he
have
be
a
minute
in
the
room
,
and
Penelope
be
send
to
tell
Miss
Rachel
that
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
want
to
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
cross
the
hall
,
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
,
I
be
bring
to
a
sudden
standstill
by
an
outbreak
of
scream
from
the
small
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
I
be
at
all
alarm
;
for
I
recognise
in
the
scream
the
favourite
large
o
of
the
Miss
Ablewhites
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
go
in
(
on
pretence
of
ask
for
instruction
about
the
dinner
)
to
discover
whether
anything
serious
have
really
happen
.
  
<EOS>
there
stand
Miss
Rachel
at
the
table
,
like
a
person
fascinate
,
with
the
Colonel
's
unlucky
Diamond
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
there
,
on
either
side
of
her
,
knelt
the
two
bouncer
,
devour
the
jewel
with
their
eye
,
and
scream
with
ecstasy
every
time
it
flash
on
them
in
a
new
light
.
<EOS>
there
,
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
,
stand
Mr.
Godfrey
,
clap
his
hand
like
a
large
child
,
and
singe
out
softly
,
"
Exquisite
!
exquisite
!
"
<EOS>
there
sit
Mr.
Franklin
in
a
chair
by
the
book
-
case
,
tugging
at
his
beard
,
and
look
anxiously
towards
the
window
.
<EOS>
and
there
,
at
the
window
,
stand
the
object
he
be
contemplate
 
my
lady
,
have
the
extract
from
the
Colonel
's
will
in
her
hand
,
and
keep
her
back
turn
on
the
whole
of
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
She
face
me
,
when
I
ask
for
my
instruction
;
and
I
see
the
family
frown
gather
over
her
eye
,
and
the
family
temper
twitch
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
to
my
room
in
half
an
hour
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
something
to
say
to
you
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
those
word
she
go
out
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
enough
that
she
be
pose
by
the
same
difficulty
which
have
pose
Mr.
Franklin
and
me
in
our
conference
at
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
be
the
legacy
of
the
Moonstone
a
proof
that
she
have
treat
her
brother
with
cruel
injustice
?
<EOS>
or
be
it
a
proof
that
he
be
bad
than
the
bad
she
have
ever
think
of
him
?
<EOS>
serious
question
those
for
my
lady
to
determine
,
while
her
daughter
,
innocent
of
all
knowledge
of
the
Colonel
's
character
,
stand
there
with
the
Colonel
's
birthday
gift
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
could
leave
the
room
in
my
turn
,
Miss
Rachel
,
always
considerate
to
the
old
servant
who
have
be
in
the
house
when
she
be
bear
,
stop
me
.
<EOS>
"
look
,
Gabriel
!
"
she
say
,
and
flash
the
jewel
before
my
eye
in
a
ray
of
sunlight
that
pour
through
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
bless
us
!
<EOS>
it
be
a
Diamond
!
<EOS>
as
large
,
or
nearly
,
as
a
plover
's
egg
!
<EOS>
the
light
that
stream
from
it
be
like
the
light
of
the
harvest
moon
.
<EOS>
when
you
look
down
into
the
stone
,
you
look
into
a
yellow
deep
that
draw
your
eye
into
it
so
that
they
see
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
It
seem
unfathomable
;
this
jewel
,
that
you
could
hold
between
your
finger
and
thumb
,
seem
unfathomable
as
the
heaven
themselves
.
<EOS>
We
set
it
in
the
sun
,
and
then
shut
the
light
out
of
the
room
,
and
it
shine
awfully
out
of
the
depth
of
its
own
brightness
,
with
a
moony
gleam
,
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
be
fascinate
:
no
wonder
her
cousin
scream
.
<EOS>
the
Diamond
lay
such
a
hold
on
me
that
I
burst
out
with
as
large
an
"
o
"
as
the
bouncer
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
only
one
of
us
who
keep
his
sense
be
Mr.
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
He
put
an
arm
round
each
of
his
sister
's
waist
,
and
,
look
compassionately
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
Diamond
and
me
,
say
,
"
Carbon
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
mere
carbon
,
my
good
friend
,
after
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
object
,
I
suppose
,
be
to
instruct
me
.
<EOS>
all
he
do
,
however
,
be
to
remind
me
of
the
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
hobble
off
to
my
army
of
waiter
downstairs
.
<EOS>
as
I
go
out
,
Mr.
Godfrey
say
,
"
dear
old
Betteredge
,
I
have
the
true
regard
for
him
!
"
<EOS>
He
be
embrace
his
sister
,
and
ogle
Miss
Rachel
,
while
he
honour
me
with
that
testimony
of
affection
.
<EOS>
something
like
a
stock
of
love
to
draw
on
THERE
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
be
a
perfect
savage
by
comparison
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
,
I
present
myself
,
as
direct
,
in
my
lady
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
what
pass
between
my
mistress
and
me
,
on
this
occasion
,
be
,
in
the
main
,
a
repetition
of
what
have
pass
between
Mr.
Franklin
and
me
at
the
Shivering
Sand
 
with
this
difference
,
that
I
take
care
to
keep
my
own
counsel
about
the
juggler
,
see
that
nothing
have
happen
to
justify
me
in
alarm
my
lady
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
when
I
receive
my
dismissal
,
I
could
see
that
she
take
the
black
view
possible
of
the
Colonel
's
motive
,
and
that
she
be
bent
on
get
the
Moonstone
out
of
her
daughter
's
possession
at
the
first
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
on
my
way
back
to
my
own
part
of
the
house
,
I
be
encounter
by
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
He
want
to
know
if
I
have
see
anything
of
his
cousin
Rachel
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
nothing
of
her
.
<EOS>
Could
I
tell
him
where
his
cousin
Godfrey
be
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
begin
to
suspect
that
cousin
Godfrey
may
not
be
far
away
from
cousin
Rachel
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
suspicion
apparently
take
the
same
turn
.
<EOS>
He
tug
hard
at
his
beard
,
and
go
and
shut
himself
up
in
the
library
with
a
bang
of
the
door
that
have
a
world
of
meaning
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
interrupt
no
more
in
the
business
of
prepare
for
the
birthday
dinner
till
it
be
time
for
me
to
smarten
myself
up
for
receive
the
company
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
have
get
my
white
waistcoat
on
,
Penelope
present
herself
at
my
toilet
,
on
pretence
of
brush
what
little
hair
I
have
get
leave
,
and
improve
the
tie
of
my
white
cravat
.
<EOS>
My
girl
be
in
high
spirit
,
and
I
see
she
have
something
to
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
give
me
a
kiss
on
the
top
of
my
bald
head
,
and
whisper
,
<EOS>
"
news
for
you
,
father
!
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
have
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
"
HIM
"
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
lady
'
committee
-
man
,
father
,
"
say
Penelope
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
nasty
sly
fellow
!
<EOS>
I
hate
him
for

<EOS>
if
I
have
have
breath
enough
,
I
should
certainly
have
protest
against
this
indecent
way
of
speak
of
an
eminent
philanthropic
character

<EOS>
but
my
daughter
happen
to
be

Penelope

I

how

They
have
go
out
arm

in

arm

both
laughing

They
come
back

walk
separate

as
grave
as
grave
could
be

and
look
straight
away
from
each
other
in
a
manner
which
there
be
no
mistaking

I
never
be
more
delighted

in

<EOS>
there
be
one
woman
in
the
world
who
can
resist
Mr.

at

I
should

another

<EOS>
here
I
should
have
protest
again

my

have
get
the

the

little
by
himself

Awkward

he

between

look
up

and
go
on
to
the
house
 
"
very
awkward
!
"
<EOS>
if
that
be
his
opinion
of
himself

he
be
quite
right

<EOS>
awkward
enough
,
I
be
sure

what
I
tell
you
all

the
hot
of

<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
the
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
get
possession
of
the
hair
-
brush
,
and
open
my
lip
to
administer
the
reproof
which
,
you
will
own
,
my
daughter
's
language
and
conduct
richly
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
could
say
a
word
,
the
crash
of
carriage
-
wheel
outside
strike
in
,
and
stop
me
.
<EOS>
the
first
of
the
dinner
-
company
have
come
.
<EOS>
Penelope
instantly
run
off
.
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
coat
,
and
look
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
My
head
be
as
red
as
a
lobster
;
but
,
in
other
respect
,
I
be
as
nicely
dress
for
the
ceremony
of
the
evening
<EOS>
as
a
man
nee
be
.
<EOS>
I
get
into
the
hall
just
in
time
to
announce
the
two
first
of
the
guest
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
feel
particularly
interested
about
them
.
<EOS>
only
the
philanthropist
's
father
and
mother
 
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Ablewhite
.
    
<EOS>
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
the
rest
of
the
company
follow
the
Ablewhites
,
till
we
have
the
whole
tale
of
them
complete
.
<EOS>
include
the
family
,
they
be
twenty
-
four
in
all
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
noble
sight
to
see
,
when
they
be
settle
in
their
place
<EOS>
round
the
dinner
-
table
,
and
the
rector
of
Frizinghall
(
with
beautiful
elocution
)
rise
and
say
grace
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
to
worry
you
with
a
list
of
the
guest
.
<EOS>
You
will
meet
none
of
them
a
second
time
 
in
my
part
of
the
story
,
at
any
rate
 
with
the
exception
of
two
.
  
<EOS>
those
two
sit
on
either
side
of
Miss
Rachel
,
who
,
as
queen
of
the
day
,
be
naturally
the
great
attraction
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
she
be
more
particularly
the
centre
-
point
towards
which
everybody
's
eye
be
direct
;
for
(
to
my
lady
's
secret
annoyance
)
she
wear
her
wonderful
birthday
present
,
which
eclipse
all
the
rest
 
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
It
be
without
any
setting
when
it
have
be
place
in
her
hand
;
but
that
universal
genius
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
have
contrive
,
with
the
help
of
his
neat
finger
and
a
little
bit
of
silver
wire
,
to
fix
it
as
a
brooch
in
the
bosom
of
her
white
dress
.
<EOS>
everybody
wonder
at
the
prodigious
size
and
beauty
of
the
Diamond
,
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
the
only
two
of
the
company
who
say
anything
out
of
the
common
way
about
it
be
those
two
guest
I
have
mention
,
who
sit
by
Miss
Rachel
on
her
right
hand
and
her
left
.
  
<EOS>
the
guest
on
her
left
be
Mr.
Candy
,
our
doctor
at
Frizinghall
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
pleasant
,
companionable
little
man
,
with
the
drawback
,
however
,
I
must
own
,
of
be
too
fond
,
in
season
and
out
of
season
,
of
his
joke
,
and
of
his
plunging
in
rather
a
headlong
manner
into
talk
with
stranger
,
without
wait
to
feel
his
way
first
.
<EOS>
in
society
he
be
constantly
make
mistake
,
and
set
people
unintentionally
by
the
ear
together
.
<EOS>
in
his
medical
practice
he
be
a
more
prudent
man
;
pick
up
his
discretion
(
as
his
enemy
say
)
by
a
kind
of
instinct
,
and
prove
to
be
generally
right
where
more
carefully
conduct
doctor
turn
out
to
be
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
what
he
say
about
the
Diamond
to
Miss
Rachel
be
say
,
as
usual
,
by
way
of
a
mystification
or
joke
.
<EOS>
He
gravely
entreat
her
(
in
the
interest
of
science
)
to
let
him
take
it
home
and
burn
it
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
first
heat
it
,
Miss
Rachel
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
to
such
and
such
a
degree
;
then
we
will
expose
it
to
a
current
of
air
;
and
,
little
by
little
 
puff
!
 
<EOS>
we
evaporate
the
Diamond
,
and
spare
you
a
world
of
anxiety
about
the
safe
keeping
of
a
valuable
precious
stone
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lady
,
listen
with
rather
a
careworn
expression
on
her
face
,
seem
to
wish
that
the
doctor
have
be
in
earnest
,
and
that
he
could
have
find
Miss
Rachel
zealous
enough
in
the
cause
of
science
to
sacrifice
her
birthday
gift
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
guest
,
who
sit
on
my
young
lady
's
right
hand
,
be
an
eminent
public
character
 
be
no
other
than
the
celebrated
indian
traveller
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
who
,
at
risk
of
his
life
,
have
penetrate
in
disguise
where
no
European
have
ever
set
foot
before
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
long
,
lean
,
wiry
,
brown
,
silent
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
weary
look
,
and
a
very
steady
,
attentive
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
rumour
that
he
be
tired
of
the
humdrum
life
among
the
people
in
our
part
,
and
longing
to
go
back
and
wander
off
on
the
tramp
again
in
the
wild
place
of
the
East
.
<EOS>
except
what
he
say
to
Miss
Rachel
about
her
jewel
,
I
doubt
if
he
speak
six
word
or
drank
so
much
as
a
single
glass
of
wine
,
all
through
the
dinner
.
<EOS>
the
Moonstone
be
the
only
object
that
interest
him
in
the
small
degree
.
<EOS>
the
fame
of
it
seem
to
have
reach
him
,
in
some
of
those
perilous
indian
place
where
his
wandering
have
lain
.
<EOS>
after
look
at
it
silently
for
so
long
a
time
that
Miss
Rachel
begin
to
get
confused
,
he
say
to
her
in
his
cool
immovable
way
,
"
if
you
ever
go
to
India
,
Miss
Verinder
,
do
not
take
your
uncle
's
birthday
gift
with
you
.
<EOS>
a
Hindoo
diamond
be
sometimes
part
of
a
Hindoo
religion
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
certain
city
,
and
a
certain
temple
in
that
city
,
where
,
dress
as
you
be
now
,
your
life
would
not
be
worth
five
minute
'
purchase
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
,
safe
in
England
,
be
quite
delighted
to
hear
of
her
danger
in
India
.
<EOS>
the
Bouncers
be
more
delighted
still
;
they
drop
their
knife
and
fork
with
a
crash
,
and
burst
out
together
vehemently
,
"
o
!
<EOS>
how
interesting
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lady
fidget
in
her
chair
,
and
change
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
dinner
get
on
,
I
become
aware
,
little
by
little
,
that
this
festival
be
not
prosper
as
other
like
festival
have
prosper
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
look
back
at
the
birthday
now
,
by
the
light
of
what
happen
afterwards
,
I
be
half
inclined
to
think
that
the
cursed
Diamond
must
have
cast
a
blight
on
the
whole
company
.
<EOS>
I
ply
them
well
with
wine
;
and
be
a
privileged
character
,
follow
the
unpopular
dish
round
the
table
,
and
whisper
to
the
company
confidentially
,
"
please
to
change
your
mind
and
try
it
;
for
I
know
it
will
do
you
good
.
"
<EOS>
nine
time
out
of
ten
they
change
their
mind
 
out
of
regard
for
their
old
original
Betteredge
,
they
be
pleased
to
say
 
but
all
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
there
be
gap
of
silence
in
the
talk
,
as
the
dinner
get
on
,
that
make
me
feel
personally
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
when
they
do
use
their
tongue
again
,
they
use
them
innocently
,
in
the
most
unfortunate
manner
and
to
the
bad
possible
purpose
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
,
the
doctor
,
for
instance
,
say
more
unlucky
thing
than
I
ever
know
him
to
say
before
.
<EOS>
take
one
sample
of
the
way
in
which
he
go
on
,
and
you
will
understand
what
I
have
to
put
up
with
at
the
sideboard
,
officiate
as
I
be
in
the
character
of
a
man
who
have
the
prosperity
of
the
festival
at
heart
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
our
lady
present
at
dinner
be
worthy
Mrs.
Threadgall
,
widow
of
the
late
Professor
of
that
name
.
<EOS>
talk
of
her
deceased
husband
perpetually
,
this
good
lady
never
mention
to
stranger
that
he
be
deceased
.
<EOS>
She
think
,
I
suppose
,
that
every
able
-
bodied
adult
in
England
ought
to
know
as
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
in
one
of
the
gap
of
silence
,
somebody
mention
the
dry
and
rather
nasty
subject
of
human
anatomy
;
whereupon
good
Mrs.
Threadgall
straightway
bring
in
her
late
husband
as
usual
,
without
mention
that
he
be
dead
.
<EOS>
anatomy
<EOS>
she
describe
as
the
Professor
's
favourite
recreation
in
his
leisure
hour
.
<EOS>
as
ill
-
luck
would
have
it
,
Mr.
Candy
,
sit
opposite
(
who
know
nothing
of
the
deceased
gentleman
)
,
hear
her
.
<EOS>
be
the
most
polite
of
man
,
he
seize
the
opportunity
of
assist
the
Professor
's
anatomical
amusement
on
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
get
some
remarkably
fine
skeleton
lately
at
the
College
of
Surgeons
,
"
say
Mr.
Candy
,
across
the
table
,
in
a
loud
cheerful
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
strongly
recommend
the
Professor
,
madam
,
when
he
next
have
an
hour
to
spare
,
to
pay
them
a
visit
.
"
  
<EOS>
You
may
have
hear
a
pin
fall
.
<EOS>
the
company
(
out
of
respect
to
the
Professor
's
memory
)
all
sit
speechless
.
<EOS>
I
be
behind
Mrs.
Threadgall
at
the
time
,
ply
her
confidentially
with
a
glass
of
hock
.
<EOS>
She
drop
her
head
,
and
say
in
a
very
low
voice
,
"
My
beloved
husband
be
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Unluckily
Mr.
Candy
,
hear
nothing
,
and
mile
away
from
suspect
the
truth
,
go
on
across
the
table
louder
and
politer
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Professor
may
not
be
aware
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
the
card
of
a
member
of
the
College
will
admit
him
,
on
any
day
but
Sunday
,
between
the
hour
of
ten
and
four
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Threadgall
drop
her
head
right
into
her
tucker
,
and
,
in
a
low
voice
still
,
repeat
the
solemn
word
,
"
My
beloved
husband
be
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
wink
hard
at
Mr.
Candy
across
the
table
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
touch
his
arm
.
<EOS>
My
lady
look
unutterable
thing
at
him
.
<EOS>
quite
useless
!
<EOS>
on
he
go
,
with
a
cordiality
that
there
be
no
stop
anyhow
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
send
the
Professor
my
card
,
if
you
will
oblige
me
by
mention
his
present
address
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
His
present
address
,
sir
,
be
the
GRAVE
,
"
say
Mrs.
Threadgall
,
suddenly
lose
her
temper
,
and
speak
with
an
emphasis
and
fury
that
make
the
glass
ring
again
.
<EOS>
"
the
Professor
have
be
dead
these
ten
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
good
heaven
!
"
say
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
except
the
Bouncers
,
who
burst
out
laugh
,
such
a
blank
now
fall
on
the
company
,
that
they
may
all
have
be
go
the
way
of
the
Professor
,
and
hail
as
he
do
from
the
direction
of
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
so
much
for
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
them
be
nearly
as
provoking
in
their
different
way
as
the
doctor
himself
.
<EOS>
when
they
ought
to
have
speak
,
they
do
not
speak
;
or
when
they
do
speak

He

I
suspect
,
of
Mr.

's
reception
in
the
rose

garden

<EOS>
but
,
talk
as

nine
time
out

ten
he
pitch
on
the
wrong
subject
,
or
he
address
himself
to
the
wrong
person

the
end
of
it
be
that
he
offend
some

puzzle
all

<EOS>
that
foreign

the
lord

while
that
great

on
cattle
be
quote
his
experience
in
the
breeding
of
bull
,
that
experience
,
properly
understand
count
for
nothing
,
and
that
the
proper
way
to
breed
bull
be
to
look
deep
into
your
own
mind
,
evolve
out
of
it
the
idea
of
a
perfect
bull
,
and
produce
him
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
say

when
our

<EOS>
what

to
Mr.

answer
,
from
the
italian
point
of
view
:
"
We
have

Love

Salad
"
?
<EOS>
He
not
only
terrify
the
company
with
such
outbreak
as
these
,
but
,
when
the
english
side
of
him
turn
up
in
due
course
,
he
lose
his
foreign
smoothness
;
and
,
get
on

such
downright

<EOS>
I
forget
how
 
to
acknowledge
that
he
have
latterly
sleep
very
badly
at
night
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
thereupon
tell
him
that
his
nerve
be
all
out
of
order
and
that
he
ought
to
go
through
a
course
of
medicine
immediately
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
reply
that
a
course
of
medicine
,
and
a
course
of
grope
in
the
dark
,
mean
,
in
his
estimation
,
one
and
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
,
hit
back
smartly
,
say
that
Mr
Franklin
himself
be
,
constitutionally
speak
,
grope
in
the
dark
after
sleep
,
and
that
nothing
but
medicine
could
help
him
to
find
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
keep
the
ball
up
on
his
side
,
say
he
have
often
hear
of
the
blind
lead
the
blind

and
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
know
what
it
mean

<EOS>
in
this
way

they
keep
it
go
briskly
,
cut
and
thrust
,
till
they
both
of
them
get
hot
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
,
in
particular
,
so
completely
lose
his
self
-
control
,
in
defence
of
his
profession
,
that
my
lady
be
oblige
to
interfere
,
and
forbid
the
dispute
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
this
necessary
act
of
authority
put
the
last
extinguisher
on
the
spirit
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
the
talk
spurt
up
again
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
for
a
minute
or
two
at
a
time
;
but
there
be
a
miserable
lack
of
life
and
sparkle
in
it
.
<EOS>
the
Devil
(
or
the
Diamond
)
possess
that
dinner
-
party
;
and
it
be
a
relief
to
everybody
when
my
mistress
rise
,
and
give
the
lady
the
signal
to
leave
the
gentleman
over
their
wine
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
range
the
decanter
in
a
row
before
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
(
who
represent
the
master
of
the
house
)
,
when
there
come
a
sound
from
the
terrace
which
,
startle
me
out
of
my
company
manner
on
the
instant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
and
I
look
at
each
other
;
it
be
the
sound
of
the
indian
drum
.
<EOS>
as
I
live
by
bread
,
here
be
the
juggler
return
to
us
with
the
return
of
the
Moonstone
to
the
house
!
  
<EOS>
as
they
round
the
corner
of
the
terrace
,
and
come
in
sight
,
I
hobble
out
to
warn
them
off
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
ill
-
luck
would
have
it
,
the
two
bouncer
be
beforehand
with
me
.
<EOS>
They
whiz
out
on
to
the
terrace
like
a
couple
of
skyrocket
,
wild
to
see
the
Indians
exhibit
their
trick
.
<EOS>
the
other
lady
follow
;
the
gentleman
come
out
on
their
side
.
<EOS>
before
you
could
say
,
"
Lord
bless
us
!
"
<EOS>
the
rogue
be
make
their
salaam
;
and
the
bouncer
be
kiss
the
pretty
little
boy
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
get
on
one
side
of
Miss
Rachel
,
and
I
put
myself
behind
her
.
<EOS>
if
our
suspicion
be
right
,
there
she
stand
,
innocent
of
all
knowledge
of
the
truth
,
show
the
Indians
the
Diamond
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
!
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
what
trick
they
perform
,
or
how
they
do
it
.
<EOS>
what
with
the
vexation
about
the
dinner
,
and
what
with
the
provocation
of
the
rogue
come
back
just
in
the
nick
of
time
to
see
the
jewel
with
their
own
eye
,
I
own
I
lose
my
head
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
that
I
remember
notice
be
the
sudden
appearance
on
the
scene
of
the
indian
traveller
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
skirt
the
half
-
circle
in
which
the
gentlefolk
stand
or
sit
,
he
come
quietly
behind
the
juggler
and
speak
to
them
on
a
sudden
in
the
language
of
their
own
country
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
have
prick
them
with
a
bayonet
,
I
doubt
if
the
Indians
could
have
start
and
turn
on
him
with
a
more
tigerish
quickness
than
they
do
,
on
hear
the
first
word
that
pass
his
lip
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
they
be
bow
and
salaam
to
him
in
their
most
polite
and
snaky
way
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
word
in
the
unknown
tongue
have
pass
on
either
side
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
withdraw
as
quietly
as
he
have
approach
.
<EOS>
the
chief
Indian
,
who
act
as
interpreter
,
thereupon
wheel
about
again
towards
the
gentlefolk
.
<EOS>
I
notice
that
the
fellow
's
coffee
-
colour
face
have
turn
grey
since
Mr.
Murthwaite
have
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
bow
to
my
lady
,
and
inform
her
that
the
exhibition
be
over
.
<EOS>
the
Bouncers
,
indescribably
disappoint
,
burst
out
with
a
loud
"
o
!
"
<EOS>
direct
against
Mr.
Murthwaite
for
stop
the
performance
.
<EOS>
the
chief
Indian
lay
his
hand
humbly
on
his
breast
,
and
say
a
second
time
that
the
juggling
be
over
.
<EOS>
the
little
boy
go
round
with
the
hat
.
<EOS>
the
lady
withdraw
to
the
drawing
-
room
;
and
the
gentleman
(
except
Mr.
Franklin
and
Mr.
Murthwaite
)
return
to
their
wine
.
<EOS>
I
and
the
footman
follow
the
Indians
,
and
see
them
safe
off
the
premise
.
  
<EOS>
go
back
by
way
of
the
shrubbery
,
I
smell
tobacco
,
and
find
Mr.
Franklin
and
Mr.
Murthwaite
(
the
latter
smoking
a
cheroot
)
walk
slowly
up
and
down
among
the
tree
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
beckon
to
me
to
join
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
present
me
to
the
great
traveller
,
"
be
Gabriel
Betteredge
,
the
old
servant
and
friend
of
our
family
of
whom
I
speak
to
you
just
now
.
<EOS>
tell
him
,
if
you
please
,
what
you
have
just
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
take
his
cheroot
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
lean
,
in
his
weary
way
,
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
begin
,
"
those
three
Indians
be
no
more
juggler
than
you
<EOS>
and
I
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
new
surprise
!
<EOS>
I
naturally
ask
the
traveller
if
he
have
ever
meet
with
the
Indians
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
never
,
"
say
Mr.
Murthwaite
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
know
what
indian
juggling
really
be
.
<EOS>
all
you
have
see
to
-
night
be
a
very
bad
and
clumsy
imitation
of
it
.
<EOS>
unless
,
after
long
experience
,
I
be
utterly
mistaken
,
those
man
be
high
-
caste
Brahmins
.
<EOS>
I
charge
them
with
be
disguise
,
and
you
see
how
it
tell
on
them
,
clever
as
the
Hindoo
people
be
in
conceal
their
feeling
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
mystery
about
their
conduct
that
I
can
not
explain
.
<EOS>
They
have
doubly
sacrifice
their
caste
 
first
,
in
cross
the
sea
;
secondly
,
in
disguise
themselves
as
juggler
.
<EOS>
in
the
land
they
live
in
that
be
a
tremendous
sacrifice
to
make
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
some
very
serious
motive
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
and
some
justification
of
no
ordinary
kind
to
plead
for
them
,
in
recovery
of
their
caste
,
when
they
return
to
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
strike
dumb
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
go
on
with
his
cheroot
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
after
what
look
to
me
like
a
little
private
veer
about
between
the
different
side
of
his
character
,
break
the
silence
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
some
hesitation
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
in
trouble
you
with
family
matter
,
in
which
you
can
have
no
interest
and
which
I
be
not
very
willing
to
speak
of
out
of
our
own
circle
.
<EOS>
but
,
after
what
you
have
say
,
I
feel
bind
,
in
the
interest
of
Lady
Verinder
and
her
daughter
,
to
tell
you
something
which
may
possibly
put
the
clue
into
your
hand
.
<EOS>
I
speak
to
you
in
confidence
;
you
will
oblige
me
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
by
not
forget
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
preface
,
he
tell
the
indian
traveller
all
that
he
have
tell
me
at
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
even
the
immovable
Mr.
Murthwaite
be
so
interested
in
what
he
hear
,
that
he
let
his
cheroot
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
when
he
have
do
,
"
what
do
your
experience
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
My
experience
,
"
answer
the
traveller
,
"
say
that
you
have
have
more
narrow
escape
of
your
life
,
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
than
I
have
have
of
mine
;
and
that
be

a
great
deal

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
Mr.
Franklin
's
turn
to
be
astonish
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
really
as
serious
as
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
my
opinion
it
be
,
"
answer
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
doubt
,
after
what
you
have
tell
me
,
that
the
restoration
of
the
Moonstone
to
its
place
on
the
forehead
of
the
indian
idol
,
be
the
motive
and
the
justification

that
sacrifice
of
caste

I
allude
to
just
now

<EOS>
those

will
wait
their
opportunity

use
it

how

say
the
eminent

light
his
cheroot
again

stare
hard
at
Mr.

fire

throw
away

notice

notice
it

He
look

It
be

very
well
for

joke

<EOS>
but
I
be
not

my

have
not
lead
me
into
play
duck
and
drake
with
my
own
life
,
among
thief

murderer
in

outlandish
place
of

earth

<EOS>
I
go
into
my
own
little
room
,
and
sit
down
in
my
chair
in
a
perspiration
,
and
wonder
helplessly
what
be
to
be
do
next

<EOS>
in
this
anxious
frame

other
man
may
have
end
by
work
themselves
up
into
a
fever

I
end
in

different
way

I
light
my
pipe
,

take
a
turn
at
ROBINSON
CRUSOE

<EOS>
before
I
have
be
at

five
minute

I
come
to
this
amazing
bit
 
page
one
hundred
and
sixty
-
one
 
as
follow
:
  
"
<EOS>
fear
of
Danger
be
ten
thousand
time
more
terrifying
than
Danger
itself
,
when
apparent
to
the
eye
;
and
we
find
the
Burthen
of
Anxiety
great
,
by
much
,
than
the
Evil
which
we
be
anxious
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
man
who
do
not
believe
in
ROBINSON
crusoe
,
after
that
,
be
a
man
with
a
screw
loose
in
his
understanding
,
or
a
man
lose
in
the
mist
of
his
own
self

conceit
!
<EOS>
argument
be
throw
away
upon
him
;
and
pity
be
better
reserve
for
some
person
with
a
lively
faith
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
far
on
with
my
second
pipe
,
and
still
lose
in
admiration
of
that
wonderful
book
,
when
Penelope
(
who
have
be
hand
round
the
tea
)
come
in
with
her
report
from
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
have
leave
the
Bouncers
singe
a
duet
 
word
begin
with
a
large
"
o
,
"
and
music
to
correspond
.
<EOS>
She
have
observe
that
my
lady
make
mistake
in
her
game
of
whist
for
the
first
time
in
our
experience
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
the
great
traveller
asleep
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
She
have
overhear
Mr.
Franklin
sharpen
his
wit
on
Mr.
Godfrey
,
at
the
expense
of
Ladies
'
charity
in
general
;
and
she
have
notice
that
Mr.
Godfrey
hit
him
back
again
rather
more
smartly
than
become
a
gentleman
of
his
benevolent
character
.
<EOS>
She
have
detect
Miss
Rachel
,
apparently
engage
in
appease
Mrs.
Threadgall
by
show
her
some
photograph
,
and
really
occupy
in
steal
look
at
Mr.
Franklin
,
which
no
intelligent
lady
's
maid
could
misinterpret
for
a
single
instant
.
<EOS>
finally
,
she
have
miss
Mr.
Candy
,
the
doctor
,
who
have
mysteriously
disappear
from
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
have
then
mysteriously
return
,
and
enter
into
conversation
with
Mr.
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
thing
be
prosper
well
than
the
experience
of
the
dinner
<EOS>
give
us
any
right
to
expect
.
<EOS>
if
we
could
only
hold
on
for
another
hour
,
old
Father
Time
would
bring
up
their
carriage
,
and
relieve
us
of
them
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
everything
wear
off
in
this
world
;
and
even
the
comfort
effect
of
ROBINSON
crusoe
wear
off
,
after
Penelope
leave
me
.
<EOS>
I
get
fidgety
again
,
and
resolve
on
make
a
survey
of
the
ground
before
the
rain
come
.
<EOS>
instead
of
take
the
footman
,
whose
nose
be
human
,
and
therefore
useless
in
any
emergency
,
I
take
the
bloodhound
with
me
.
<EOS>
his
nose
for
a
stranger
be
to
be
depend
on
.
<EOS>
We
go
all
round
the
premise
,
and
out
into
the
road
 
and
return
as
wise
as
we
go
,
have
discover
no
such
thing
as
a
lurk
human
creature
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
the
arrival
of
the
carriage
be
the
signal
for
the
arrival
of
the
rain
.
<EOS>
It
pour
as
if
it
mean
to
pour
all
night
.
<EOS>
with
the
exception
of
the
doctor
,
whose
gig
be
wait
for
him
,
the
rest
of
the
company
go
home
snugly
,
under
cover
,
in
close
carriage
.
<EOS>
I
tell
Mr.
Candy
that
I
be
afraid
he
would
get
wet
through
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
in
return
,
that
he
wonder
I
have
arrive
at
my
time
of
life
,
without
know
that
a
doctor
's
skin
be
waterproof
.
<EOS>
so
he
drive
away
in
the
rain
,
laugh
over
his
own
little
joke
;
and
so
we
get
rid
of
our
dinner
company
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
thing
to
tell
be
the
story
of
the
night
.
    
<EOS>
when
the
last
of
the
guest
have
drive
away
,
I
go
back
into
the
inner
hall
and
find
Samuel
at
the
side
-
table
,
preside
over
the
brandy
and
soda
-
water
.
<EOS>
My
lady
and
Miss
Rachel
come
out
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
follow
by
the
two
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
have
some
brandy
and
soda
-
water
,
Mr.
Franklin
take
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
sit
down
,
look
dead
tired
;
the
talking
on
this
birthday
occasion
have
,
I
suppose
,
be
too
much
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
,
turn
round
to
wish
them
good
-
night
,
look
hard
at
the
wicked
Colonel
's
legacy
shine
in
her
daughter
's
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rachel
,
"
she
ask
,
"
where
be
you
go
to
put
your
Diamond
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
be
in
high
good
spirit
,
just
in
that
humour
for
talk
nonsense
,
and
perversely
persist
in
it
as
if
it
be
sense
,
which
you
may
sometimes
have
observe
in
young
girl
,
when
they
be
highly
work
up
,
at
the
end
of
an
exciting
day
.
<EOS>
first
,
she
declare
she
do
not
know
where
to
put
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
then
she
say
,
"
on
her
dressing
-
table
,
of
course
,
along
with
her
other
thing
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
remember
that
the
Diamond
may
take
to
shining
of
itself
,
with
its
awful
moony
light
in
the
dark
 
and
that
would
terrify
her
in
the
dead
of
night
.
<EOS>
then
she
bethink
herself
of
an
indian
cabinet
which
stand
in
her
sitting
-
room
;
and
instantly
make
up
her
mind
to
put
the
indian
diamond
in
the
indian
cabinet
,
for
the
purpose
of
permit
two
beautiful
native
production
to
admire
each
other
.
<EOS>
have
let
her
little
flow
of
nonsense
run
on
as
far
as
that
point
,
her
mother
interpose
and
stop
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
<EOS>
your
indian
cabinet
have
no
lock
to
it
,
"
say
my
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
Heavens
,
mamma
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Miss
Rachel
,
"
be
this
an
hotel
?
<EOS>
be
there
thief
in
the
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
without
take
notice
of
this
fantastic
way
of
talking
,
my
lady
wish
the
gentleman
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
She
next
turn
to
Miss
Rachel
,
and
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
"
why
not
let
me
keep
the
Diamond
for
you
to
-
night
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
receive
that
proposal
as
she
may
,
ten
year
since
,
have
receive
a
proposal
to
part
her
from
a
new
doll
.
<EOS>
My
lady
see
there
be
no
reasoning
with
her
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
come
into
my
room
,
Rachel
,
the
first
thing
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
with
those
last
word
she
leave
us
slowly
;
think
her
own
thought
,
and
,
to
all
appearance
,
not
best
pleased
with
the
way
by
which
they
be
lead
her
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
be
the
next
to
say
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
She
shake
hand
first
with
Mr.
Godfrey
,
who
be
stand
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
,
look
at
a
picture
.
<EOS>
then
she
turn
back
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
still
sit
weary
and
silent
in
a
corner
.
  
<EOS>
what
word
pass
between
them
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
but
stand
near
the
old
oak
frame
which
hold
our
large
looking
-
glass
,
I
see
her
reflect
in
it
,
slyly
slip
the
locket
which
Mr.
Franklin
have
give
to
her
,
out
of
the
bosom
of
her
dress
,
and
show
it
to
him
for
a
moment
,
with
a
smile
which
certainly
mean
something
out
of
the
common
,
before
she
trip
off
to
bed
.
<EOS>
this
incident
stagger
me
a
little
in
the
reliance
I
have
previously
feel
on
my
own
judgment
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
that
Penelope
may
be
right
about
the
state
of
her
young
lady
's
affection
,
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Miss
Rachel
leave
him
eye
to
see
with
,
Mr.
Franklin
notice
me
.
<EOS>
His
variable
humour
,
shift
about
everything
,
have
shift
about
the
Indians
already
.
  
<EOS>
"
Betteredge
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
be
half
inclined
to
think
I
take
Mr.
Murthwaite
too
seriously
,
when
we
have
that
talk
in
the
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
he
have
be
try
any
of
his
traveller
's
tale
on
us
?
<EOS>
do
you
really
mean
to
let
the
dog
loose
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
relieve
them
of
their
collar
,
sir

"
I
answer
,
"
and
leave
them
free
to
take
a
turn
in
the
night
,
if
they
smell
a
reason
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
see
what
be
to
be
do
to

morrow

<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
dispose
to
alarm
my
aunt
,
Betteredge
,
without
a
very
pressing
reason
for

good

<EOS>
He
look
so
worn
and
pale
as
he
nod
to
me
,
and
take
his
candle
to
go
up
-
stair
,
that
I
venture
to
advise
his
have
a
drop
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
by
way
of
night
-
cap
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
walk
towards
us
from
the
other
end
of
the
hall
,
back
me
.
<EOS>
He
press
Mr.
Franklin
,
in
the
friendly
manner
,
to
take
something
,
before
he
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
only
note
these
trifling
circumstance
,
because
,
after
all
I
have
see
and
hear
,
that
day
,
it
please
me
to
observe
that
our
two
gentleman
be
on
just
as
good
term
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Their
warfare
of
word
(
hear
by
Penelope
in
the
drawing
-
room
)
,
and
their
rivalry
for
the
good
place
in
Miss
Rachel
's
good
grace
,
seem
to
have
set
no
serious
difference
between
them
.
<EOS>
but
there
!
<EOS>
they
be
both
good
-
tempered
,
and
both
man
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
certainly
this
merit
in
people
of
station
,
that
they
be
not
nearly
so
quarrelsome
among
each
other
as
people
of
no
station
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
decline
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
go
up
-
stair
with
Mr.
Godfrey
,
their
room
be
next
door
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
on
the
landing
,
however
,
either
his
cousin
persuade
him
,
or
he
veer
about
and
change
his
mind
as
usual
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
may
want
it
in
the
night
,
"
he
call
down
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
send
up
some
brandy
-
and
-
water
into
my
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
send
up
Samuel
with
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
;
and
then
go
out
and
unbuckle
the
dog
'
collar
.
<EOS>
They
both
lose
their
head
with
astonishment
on
be
set
loose
at
that
time
of
night
,
and
jump
upon
me
like
a
couple
of
puppy
!
<EOS>
however
,
the
rain
soon
cool
them
down
again
:
they
lap
a
drop
of
water
each
,
and
creep
back
into
their
kennel
.
<EOS>
as
I
go
into
the
house
I
notice
sign
in
the
sky
which
betoken
a
break
in
the
weather
for
the
well
.
<EOS>
for
the
present
,
it
still
pour
heavily
,
and
the
ground
be
in
a
perfect
sop
.
  
<EOS>
Samuel
and
I
go
all
over
the
house
,
and
shut
up
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
examine
everything
myself
,
and
trust
nothing
to
my
deputy
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
all
be
safe
and
fast
when
I
rest
my
old
bone
in
bed
,
between
midnight
and
one
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
the
worry
of
the
day
have
be
a
little
too
much
for
me
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
I
have
a
touch
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
malady
that
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
sunrise
before
I
fall
off
at
last
into
a
sleep
.
<EOS>
all
the
time
I
lie
awake
the
house
be
as
quiet
as
the
grave
.
<EOS>
not
a
sound
stir
but
the
splash
of
the
rain
,
and
the
sighing
of
the
wind
among
the
tree
as
a
breeze
spring
up
with
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
about
half
-
past
seven
I
wake
,
and
open
my
window
on
a
fine
sunshiny
day
.
<EOS>
the
clock
have
strike
eight
,
and
I
be
just
go
out
to
chain
up
the
dog
again
,
when
I
hear
a
sudden
whisking
of
petticoat
on
the
stair
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
turn
about
,
and
there
be
Penelope
fly
down
after
me
like
mad
.
"
<EOS>
Father
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
scream
,
"
come
up

stair
,
for
God
's
sake
!
<EOS>

diamond

GONE

"
<EOS>
"
be
you
out
of
your

<EOS>
"
I
ask
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
go

"
say
Penelope
.
<EOS>
"
go
,
nobody
know
how

<EOS>
come
up
and
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
drag
me
after
her
into
our
young
lady
's
sitting
-
room
,
which
open
into
her
bedroom
.
<EOS>
there
,
on
the
threshold
of
her
bedroom
door
,
stand
Miss
Rachel
,
almost
as
white
in
the
face
as
the
white
dressing
-
gown
that
clothe
her
.
<EOS>
there
also
stand
the
two
door
of
the
indian
cabinet
,
wide
open
.
<EOS>
one
,
of
the
drawer
inside
be
pull
out
as
far
as
it
would
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
!
"
say
Penelope
.
<EOS>
"
I
myself
see
Miss
Rachel
put
the
Diamond
into
that
drawer
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
I
go
to
the
cabinet
.
<EOS>
the
drawer
be
empty
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
this
true
,
miss
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
with
a
look
that
be
not
like
herself
,
with
a
voice
that
be
not
like
her
own
,
Miss
Rachel
answer
as
my
daughter
have
answer
:
"
the
Diamond
be
go
!
"
<EOS>
have
say
those
word
,
she
withdraw
into
her
bedroom
,
and
shut
and
lock
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
before
we
know
which
way
to
turn
next
,
my
lady
come
in
,
hear
my
voice
in
her
daughter
's
sitting
-
room
,
and
wonder
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
the
news
of
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
seem
to
petrify
her
.
<EOS>
She
go
straight
to
Miss
Rachel
's
bedroom
,
and
insist
on
be
admit
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
let
her
in
.
  
<EOS>
the
alarm
,
run
through
the
house
like
fire
,
catch
the
two
gentleman
next
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
be
the
first
to
come
out
of
his
room
.
<EOS>
all
he
do
when
he
hear
what
have
happen
be
to
hold
up
his
hand
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
,
which
do
not
say
much
for
his
natural
strength
of
mind
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
whose
clear
head
I
have
confidently
count
on
to
advise
us
,
seem
to
be
as
helpless
as
his
cousin
when
he
hear
the
news
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
for
a
wonder
,
he
have
have
a
good
night
's
rest
at
last
;
and
the
unaccustomed
luxury
of
sleep
have
,
as
he
say
himself
,
apparently
stupefy
him
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
he
have
swallow
his
cup
of
coffee
 
which
he
always
take
,
on
the
foreign
plan
,
some
hour
before
he
eat
any
breakfast
 
his
brain
brighten
;
the
clear
-
headed
side
of
him
turn
up
,
and
he
take
the
matter
in
hand
,
resolutely
and
cleverly
,
much
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
He
first
send
for
the
servant
,
and
tell
them
to
leave
all
the
low
door
and
window
(
with
the
exception
of
the
front
door
,
which
I
have
open
)
exactly
as
they
have
be
leave
when
we
lock
up
over
night
.
<EOS>
He
next
propose
to
his
cousin
and
to
me
to
make
quite
sure
,
before
we
take
any
further
step
,
that
the
Diamond
have
not
accidentally
drop
somewhere
out
of
sight
 
say
at
the
back
of
the
cabinet
,
or
down
behind
the
table
on
which
the
cabinet
stand
.
<EOS>
have
search
in
both
place
,
and
find
nothing
 
have
also
question
Penelope
,
and
discover
from
her
no
more
than
the
little
she
have
already
tell
me
 
Mr.
Franklin
suggest
next
extend
our
inquiry
to
Miss
Rachel
,
and
send
Penelope
to
knock
at
her
bed
-
room
door
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
answer
the
knock
,
and
close
the
door
behind
her
.
<EOS>
the
moment
after
we
hear
it
lock
inside
by
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
come
out
among
us
,
look
sorely
puzzle
and
distressed
.
<EOS>
"
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
seem
to
have
quite
overwhelm
Rachel
,
"
she
say
,
in
reply
to
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
She
shrink
,
in
the
strange
manner
,
from
speak
of
it
,
even
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
you
can
see
her
for
the
present
.
"
<EOS>
have
add
to
our
perplexity
by
this
account
of
Miss
Rachel
,
my
lady
,
after
a
little
effort
,
recover
her
usual
composure
,
and
act
with
her
usual
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
be
no
help
for
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
have
no
alternative
but
to
send
for
the
police
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
the
first
thing
for
the
police
to
do
,
"
add
Mr.
Franklin
,
catch
her
up
,
"
be
to
lay
hand
on
the
indian
juggler
who
perform
here
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
lady
and
Mr.
Godfrey
(
not
know
what
Mr.
Franklin
and
I
know
)
both
start
,
and
both
look
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
stop
to
explain
myself
now
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
tell
you
that
the
Indians
have
certainly
steal
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
give
me
a
letter
of
introduction
,
"
say
he
,
address
my
lady
,
"
to
one
of
the
magistrate
at
Frizinghall
 
merely
tell
him
that
I
represent
your
interest
and
wish
,
and
let
me
ride
off
with
it
instantly
.
<EOS>
Our
chance
of
catch
the
thief
may
depend
on
our
not
waste
one
unnecessary
minute
.
"
<EOS>
(
Nota
bene
:
<EOS>
whether
it
be
the
french
side
or
the
English
,
the
right
side
of
Mr.
Franklin
seem
to
be
uppermost
now
.
<EOS>
the
only
question
be
,
how
long
would
it
last
?
)
  
<EOS>
He
put
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
before
his
aunt
,
who
(
as
it
appear
to
me
)
write
the
letter
he
want
a
little
unwillingly
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
be
possible
to
overlook
such
an
event
as
the
loss
of
a
jewel
worth
twenty
thousand
pound
,
I
believe
 
with
my
lady
's
opinion
of
her
late
brother
,
and
her
distrust
of
his
birthday
-
gift
 
<EOS>
it
would
have
be
privately
a
relief
to
her
to
let
the
thief
get
off
with
the
Moonstone
scot
free
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
out
with
Mr.
Franklin
to
the
stable
,
and
take
the
opportunity
of
ask
him
how
the
Indians
(
whom
I
suspect
,
of
course
,
as
shrewdly
as
he
do
)
could
possibly
have
get
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
of
them
may
have
slip
into
the
hall
,
in
the
confusion
,
when
the
dinner
company
be
go
away
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
the
fellow
may
have
be
under
the
sofa
while
my
aunt
and
Rachel
be
talk
about
where
the
Diamond
be
to
be
put
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
He
would
only
have
to
wait
till
the
house
be
quiet
,
and
there
it
would
be
in
the
cabinet
,
to
be
have
for
the
taking
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
those
word
,
he
call
to
the
groom
to
open
the
gate
,
and
gallop
off
.
  
<EOS>
this
seem
certainly
to
be
the
only
rational
explanation
.
<EOS>
but
how
have
the
thief
contrive
to
make
his
escape
from
the
house
?
<EOS>
I
have
find
the
front
door
lock
and
bolt
,
as
I
have
leave
it
at
night
,
when
I
go
to
open
it
,
after
get
up
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
other
door
and
window
,
there
they
be
still
,
all
safe
and
fast
,
to
speak
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
dog
,
too
?
<EOS>
suppose
the
thief
have
get
away
by
drop
from
one
of
the
upper
window
,
how
have
he
escape
the
dog
?
<EOS>
have
he
come
provide
for
them
with
drugged
meat
?
<EOS>
as
the
doubt
cross
my
mind
,
the
dog
themselves
come
gallop
at
me
round
a
corner
,
roll
each
other
over
on
the
wet
grass
,
in
such
lively
health
and
spirit
that
it
be
with
no
small
difficulty
I
bring
them
to
reason
,
and
chain
them
up
again
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
turn
it
over
in
my
mind
,
the
less
satisfactory
Mr.
Franklin
's
explanation
appear
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
our
breakfast
 
whatever
happen
in
a
house
,
robbery
or
murder
,
it
do
not
matter
,
you
must
have
your
breakfast
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
do
,
my
lady
send
for
me
;
and
I
find
myself
compel
to
tell
her
all
that
I
have
hitherto
conceal
,
relate
to
the
Indians
and
their
plot
.
<EOS>
be
a
woman
of
a
high
courage
,
she
soon
get
over
the
first
startling
effect
of
what
I
have
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
seem
to
be
far
more
perturbed
about
her
daughter
than
about
the
heathen
rogue
and
their
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
odd
Rachel
be
,
and
how
differently
she
behave
sometimes
from
other
girl
,
"
my
lady
say
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
never
,
in
all
my
experience
,
see
her
so
strange
and
so
reserved
as
she
be
now
.
<EOS>
the
loss
of
her
jewel
seem
almost
to
have
turn
her
brain
.
<EOS>
who
would
have
think
that
horrible
Diamond
could
have
lay
such
a
hold
on
her
in
so
short
a
time
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
strange
.
<EOS>
take
toy
and
trinket
in
general
,
Miss
Rachel
be
nothing
like
so
mad
after
them
as
most
young
girl
.
<EOS>
yet
there
she
be
,
still
lock
up
inconsolably
in
her
bedroom
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
fair
to
add
that
she
be
not
the
only
one
of
us
in
the
house
who
be
throw
out
of
the
regular
groove
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
for
instance
 
though
professionally
a
sort
of
consoler
-
general
 
seem
to
be
at
a
loss
where
to
look
for
his
own
resource
.
<EOS>
have
no
company
to
amuse
him
,
and
get
no
chance
of
try
what
his
experience
of
woman
in
distress
could
do
towards
comfort
Miss
Rachel
,
he
wander
hither
and
thither
about
the
house
and
gardens
in
an
aimless
uneasy
way
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
two
different
mind
about
what
it
become
him
to
do
,
after
the
misfortune
that
have
happen
to
us
.
<EOS>
Ought
he
to
relieve
the
family
,
in
their
present
situation
,
of
the
responsibility
of
him
as
a
guest
,
or
ought
he
to
stay
on
the
chance
that
even
his
humble
service
may
be
of
some
use
?
<EOS>
He
decide
ultimately
that
the
last
course
be
perhaps
the
most
customary
and
considerate
course
to
take
,
in
such
a
very
peculiar
case
of
family
distress
as
this
be
.
<EOS>
circumstance
try
the
metal
a
man
be
really
make
of
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
try
by
circumstance
,
show
himself
of
weak
metal
than
I
have
think
him
to
be
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
woman
-
servant
except
Rosanna
Spearman
,
who

take
to
whisper
together

the
manner
of
that
weak
half
of
the
human
family

when
anything
extraordinary

in
a
house

<EOS>
I
myself
acknowledge
to
have

<EOS>
the
cursed
Moonstone
have
turn
us
all
upside
down

<EOS>
a
little
before
eleven
Mr.
Franklin
come
back
.
<EOS>
the
resolute
side
of
him
have
,
to
all
appearance
,
give
way
,
in
the
interval
since
his
departure
,
under
the
stress
that
have

lay
on
it

<EOS>
He
have
leave
us
at
a
gallop
;
he
come
back
to
us
at
a
walk

<EOS>
when
he
go
away

he
be
make
of
iron

<EOS>
when
he
return

he
be
stuff
with
cotton

<EOS>
"

say
my

"
be
the
police
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

"
say
Mr.
Franklin
;

they

<EOS>
Superintendent
Seegrave

of
his

<EOS>
a
mere
form

<EOS>
the

be
hopeless

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
have
the
Indians
escape
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
poor
ill

use
Indians
have
be
most
unjustly
put
in
prison
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
as
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn

<EOS>
My
idea
that
one
of
them
be
hide
in
the
house
have
end
,
like
all
the
rest
of
my
idea
,
in
smoke
.
<EOS>
It
be
be
prove
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
dwell
with
great
relish
on
his
own
incapacity
,
"
to
be
simply
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
astonish
us
by
announce
this
totally
new
turn
in
the
matter
of
the
Moonstone
,
our
young
gentleman
,
at
his
aunt
's
request
,
take
a
seat
,
and
explain
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
that
the
resolute
side
of
him
have
hold
out
as
far
as
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
He
have
put
the
whole
case
plainly
before
the
magistrate
,
and
the
magistrate
have
at
once
send
for
the
police
.
<EOS>
the
first
inquiry
institute
about
the
Indians
<EOS>
show
that
they
have
not
so
much
as
attempt
to
leave
the
town
.
<EOS>
further
question
address
to
the
police
,
prove
that
all
three
have
be
see
return
to
Frizinghall
with
their
boy
,
on
the
previous
night
between
ten
and
eleven
 
<EOS>
which
(
regard
be
have
to
hour
and
distance
)
also
prove
that
they
have
walk
straight
back
after
perform
on
our
terrace
.
<EOS>
later
still
,
at
midnight
,
the
police
,
have
occasion
to
search
the
common
lodging
-
house
where
they
live
,
have
see
them
all
three
again
,
and
their
little
boy
with
them
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
soon
after
midnight
I
myself
have
safely
shut
up
the
house
.
<EOS>
plainer
evidence
than
this
,
in
favour
of
the
Indians
,
there
could
not
well
be
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
say
there
be
not
even
a
case
of
suspicion
against
them
so
far
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
it
be
just
possible
,
when
the
police
come
to
investigate
the
matter
,
that
discovery
affect
the
juggler
may
be
make
,
he
would
contrive
,
by
commit
them
as
rogue
and
vagabond
,
to
keep
them
at
our
disposal
,
under
lock
and
key
,
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
They
have
ignorantly
do
something
(
I
forget
what
)
in
the
town
,
which
barely
bring
them
within
the
operation
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
every
human
institution
(
justice
include
)
will
stretch
a
little
,
if
you
only
pull
it
the
right
way
.
<EOS>
the
worthy
magistrate
be
an
old
friend
of
my
lady
's
,
and
the
Indians
be
"
commit
"
for
a
week
,
as
soon
as
the
court
open
that
morning
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
Mr.
Franklin
's
narrative
of
event
at
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
the
indian
clue
to
the
mystery
of
the
lost
jewel
be
now
,
to
all
appearance
,
a
clue
that
have
break
in
our
hand
.
<EOS>
if
the
juggler
be
innocent
,
who
,
in
the
name
of
wonder
,
have
take
the
Moonstone
out
of
Miss
Rachel
's
drawer
?
  
<EOS>
ten
minute
later
,
to
our
infinite
relief
;
Superintendent
Seegrave
arrive
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
report
pass
Mr.
Franklin
on
the
terrace
,
sit
in
the
sun
(
I
suppose
with
the
italian
side
of
him
uppermost
)
,
and
warn
the
police
,
as
they
go
by
,
that
the
investigation
be
hopeless
,
before
the
investigation
have
begin
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
family
in
our
situation
,
the
superintendent
of
the
Frizinghall
police
be
the
most
comforting
officer
you
could
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Seegrave
be
tall
and
portly
,
and
military
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
fine
commanding
voice
,
and
a
mighty
resolute
eye
,
and
a
grand
frock
-
coat
which
button
beautifully
up
to
his
leather
stock
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
the
man
you
want
!
"
be
write
all
over
his
face
;
and
he
order
his
two
inferior
police
man
about
with
a
severity
which
convince
us
all
that
there
be
no
trifling
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
begin
by
go
round
the
premise
,
outside
and
in
;
the
result
of
that
investigation
prove
to
him
that
no
thief
have
break
in
upon
us
from
outside
,
and
that
the
robbery
,
consequently
,
must
have
be
commit
by
some
person
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
leave
you
to
imagine
the
state
the
servant
be
in
when
this
official
announcement
first
reach
their
ear
.
<EOS>
the
superintendent
decide
to
begin
by
examine
the
boudoir
,
and
,
that
do
,
to
examine
the
servant
next
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
he
post
one
of
his
man
on
the
staircase
which
lead
to
the
servant
'
bedroom
,
with
instruction
to
let
nobody
in
the
house
pass
him
,
till
further
order
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
latter
proceeding
,
the
weak
half
of
the
human
family
go
distract
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
They
bounce
out
of
their
comer
,
whisk
up

stair
in
a
body
to
Miss
Rachel

room
<EOS>
(

,
burst
in
on
Superintendent
Seegrave
,
and
,
all
look
equally
guilty
,
summon
him
to
say
which
of
them
he
suspect
,
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
prove
equal
to
the
occasion
;
he
look
at
them
with
his
resolute
eye
,
and
he
cow
them
with
his
military
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"

say
Mr.

suddenly
point
to
a

just

on
the

"
a
timely
word
from
me
put
Justice
and
Penelope
on
a
pleasanter
foot
together
.
<EOS>
the
question
and
answer
go
swimmingly
,
and
end
in
nothing
worth
mention
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
have
see
Miss
Rachel
put
the
Diamond
in
the
drawer
of
the
cabinet
the
last
thing
at
night

<EOS>
Mr.

next
ask
to
see
Miss
Rachel
herself
.
<EOS>
Penelope
mention
his
request
through
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
answer
reach
us
by
the
same
road
:
"
I
have
nothing
to
tell
the
policeman
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
Our
experienced
officer
look
equally
surprised
and
offend
when
he
hear
that
reply
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
my
young
lady
be
ill
,
and
beg
him
to
wait
a
little
and
see
her
later
.
<EOS>
We
thereupon
go
downstairs
again
,
and
be

summon
to
say
if
they
could
throw
any
light
on
the
matter

<EOS>
neither
of
them
know
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
have
they
hear
any
suspicious
noise
during
the
previous
night
?
<EOS>
They
have
hear
nothing
but
the
pattering
of
the
rain
.
<EOS>
have
I
,
lie
awake
longer
than
either

<EOS>

<EOS>
release
from

,
Mr.
Franklin
,
still
stick
to
the
helpless
view
of
our
difficulty
,
whisper
to
me
:
"
that
man
will
be
of
no
earthly
use
to
us
.
<EOS>
Superintendent
Seegrave

an
ass
.
"
<EOS>
release
in
his
turn
,
Mr.

to
me
 
"

Betteredge

"
<EOS>
many
man

many
opinion

as
one
of
the
ancient

,
before

<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
's
next
proceeding
take
him
back
to
the
"
boudoir
"
again
,
with
my
daughter
and
me
at
his
heel
.
<EOS>
His
object
be
to
discover
whether
any
of
the
furniture
have
be
move
,
during
the
night
,
out
of
its
customary
place
 
his
previous
investigation
in
the
room
have
,
apparently
,
not
go
quite
far
enough
to
satisfy
his
mind
on
this
point
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
still
poke
about
among
the
chair
and
table
,
the
door
of
the
bed
-
room
be
suddenly
open
.
<EOS>
after
have
deny
herself
to
everybody
,
Miss
Rachel
,
to
our
astonishment
,
walk
into
the
midst
of
us
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
She
take
up
her
garden
hat
from
a
chair
,
and
then
go
straight
to
Penelope
with
this
question
:
    
"
Mr.
Franklin
Blake

a
message
to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
"
where

"
  
<EOS>
hearing
voice
on
the
terrace
below
,
I
look
out
of
window
,
and
see
the
two
gentleman
walk
up
and
down
together
.
<EOS>
answer
for
my
daughter
,
I
say
,
"
Mr.
Franklin

the
terrace

"
  
<EOS>
without
another
word
,
without
heed
Mr.
Superintendent
,
who
try
to
speak
to
her
,
pale
as
death
,
and
wrap
up
strangely
in
her
own
thought
,
she
leave
the
room
,
and
go
down
to
her
cousin
on
the
terrace
.
  
<EOS>
It
show
a
want
of
due
respect
,
it
show
a
breach
of
good
manner
,
on
my
part
,
but
,
for
the
life
of
me
,
I
could
not
help
look
out
of
window
when
Miss
Rachel
meet
the
gentleman
outside
.
<EOS>
She
go
up
to
Mr.
Franklin
without
appear
to
notice
Mr.
Godfrey
,
who
thereupon
draw
back
and
leave
them
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
what
she
say
to
Mr.
Franklin
appear
to
be
speak
vehemently
.
<EOS>
It
last
but
for
a
short
time
,
and
,
judge
by
what
I
see
of
his
face
from
the
window
,
seem
to
astonish
him
beyond
all
power
of
expression
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
still
together
,
my
lady
appear
on
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
see
her
 
say
a
few
last
word
to
Mr.

and
suddenly
go
back
into

<EOS>
My

Mr.

speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.

join
them
,
and

also
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
walk
away
a
little
between
the
two
,
tell
them
what
have
happen
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
for
they
both
stop
short
,
after
take
a
few
step
,
like
person
strike
with
amazement
.
<EOS>
I
have
just

,
when

room
be
open
violently
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel

swiftly
through
to
her

wild
and
angry
,
with
fierce
eye
and
flaming
cheek
.
<EOS>
Mr.

more
attempt
to
question
her

<EOS>
She
turn
round
on
him
at
her

<EOS>
"

<EOS>

<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
with
those
word

<EOS>
Penelope

<EOS>
what
do

<EOS>
I

by
the
loss
of
her

<EOS>
be
anxious
for

officer
 
<EOS>
and
I
make
the

<EOS>
in

I
be
more
puzzle
by
Miss

extraordinary
language
and
conduct
than
word
can
tell
.
<EOS>
take
what
she
have
say
at
her
bed
-
room
door
as
a
guide
to
guess
by
,
I
could
only
conclude
that
she
be
mortally
offend
by
our
send
for
the
police
,
and
that
Mr.
Franklin
's
astonishment
on
the
terrace
be
cause
by
her
have
express
herself
to
him
(
as
the
person
chiefly
instrumental
in
fetch
the
police
)
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
if
this
guess
be
right
,
why
 
have
lose
her
Diamond
 
should
she
object
to
the
presence
in
the
house
of
the
very
people
whose
business
it
be
to
recover
it
for
her
?
<EOS>
and
how
,
in
Heaven
's
name
,
could
she
know
that
the
Moonstone
would
never
be
find
again
?
  
<EOS>
as
thing
stand
,
at
present
,
no
answer
to
those
question
be
to
be
hope
for
from
anybody
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
appear
to
think
it
a
point
of
honour
to
forbear
repeat
to
a
servant
 
even
to
so
old
a
servant
as
I
be
 
what
Miss
Rachel
have
say
to
him
on
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
who
,
as
a
gentleman
and
a
relative
,
have
be
probably
admit
into
Mr.
Franklin
's
confidence
,
respect
that
confidence
as
he
be
bind
to
do
.
<EOS>
My
lady
,
who
be
also
in
the
secret
no
doubt
,
and
who
alone
have
access
to
Miss
Rachel
,
own
openly
that
she
could
make
nothing
of
her
.
"
<EOS>
You
madden
me
when
you
talk
of
the
Diamond
!
<EOS>
"
all
her
mother
's
influence
fail
to
extract
from
her
a
word
more
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
be
,
then
,
at
a
dead
-
lock
about
Miss
Rachel
 
and
at
a
dead
-
lock
about
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
case
,
my
lady
be
powerless
to
help
us
.
<EOS>
in
the
second
(
as
you
shall
presently
judge
)
,
Mr.
Seegrave
be
fast
approach
the
condition
of
a
superintendent
at
his
wit
'
end
.
  
<EOS>
have
ferret
about
all
over
the
"
boudoir
,
"
without
make
any
discovery
among
the
furniture
,
our
experienced
officer
apply
to
me
to
know
,
whether
the
servant
in
general
be
or
be
not
acquaint
with
the
place
in
which
the
Diamond
have
be
put
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
where
it
be
put
,
sir
,
"
I
say
,
"
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
Samuel
,
the
footman
,
know
also
 
for
he
be
present
in
the
hall
,
when
they
be
talk
about
where
the
Diamond
be
to
be
keep
that
night
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
know
,
as
she
have
already
tell
you
.
<EOS>
She
or
Samuel
may
have
mention
the
thing
to
the
other
servant
 
or
the
other
servant
may
have
hear
the
talk
for
themselves
,
through
the
side
-
door
of
the
hall
,
which
may
have
be
open
to
the
back
staircase
.
<EOS>
for
all
I
can
tell
,
everybody
in
the
house
may
have
know
where
the
jewel
be
,
last
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
answer
present
rather
a
wide
field
for
Mr.
Superintendent
's
suspicion
to
range
over
,
he
try
to
narrow
it
by
ask
about
the
servant
'
character
next
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
directly
of
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
neither
my
place
nor
my
wish
to
direct
suspicion
against
a
poor
girl
,
whose
honesty
have
be
above
all
doubt
as
long
as
I
have
know
her
.
<EOS>
the
matron
at
the
Reformatory
have
report
her
to
my
lady
as
a
sincerely
penitent
and
thoroughly
trustworthy
girl
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
superintendent
's
business
to
discover
reason
for
suspect
her
first
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
it
would
be
my
duty
to
tell
him
how
she
come
into
my
lady
's
service
.
<EOS>
"
all
our
people
have
excellent
character
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
all
have
deserve
the
trust
their
mistress
have
place
in
them
.
"
<EOS>
after
that
,
there
be
but
one
thing
leave
for
Mr.
Seegrave
to
do
 
namely
,
to
set
to
work
,
and
tackle
the
servant
'
character
himself
.
  
<EOS>
one
after
another
,
they
be
examine
.
<EOS>
one
after
another
,
they
prove
to
have
nothing
to
say
 
and
say
it
(
so
far
as
the
woman
be
concern
)
at
great
length
,
and
with
a
very
angry
sense
of
the
embargo
lay
on
their
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
them
be
send
back
to
their
place
downstairs
,
Penelope
be
then
summon
,
and
examine
separately
a
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
My
daughter
's
little
outbreak
of
temper
in
the
"
boudoir
,
"
and
her
readiness
to
think
herself
suspect
,
appear
to
have
produce
an
unfavourable
impression
on
Superintendent
Seegrave
.
<EOS>
It
seem
also
to
dwell
a
little
on
his
mind
,
that
she
have
be
the
last
person
who
see
the
Diamond
at
night
.
<EOS>
when
the
second
questioning
be
over
,
my
girl
come
back
to
me
in
a
frenzy
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
of
it
any
longer
 
<EOS>
the
police
-
officer
have
almost
as
good
as
tell
her
she
be
the
thief
!
<EOS>
I
could
scarcely
believe
him
(
take
Mr.
Franklin
's
view
)
to
be
quite
such
an
ass
as
that
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
he
say
nothing
,
the
eye
with
which
he
look
at
my
daughter
be
not
a
very
pleasant
eye
to
see
.
<EOS>
I
laugh
it
off
with
poor
Penelope
,
as
something
too
ridiculous
to
be
treat
seriously
 
which
it
certainly
be
.
<EOS>
secretly
,
I
be
afraid
I
be
foolish
enough
to
be
angry
too
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
trying
 
<EOS>
it
be
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
My
girl
sit
down
in
a
corner
,
with
her
apron
over
her
head
,
quite
break
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
foolish
of
her
,
you
will
say
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
wait
till
he
openly
accuse
her
.
<EOS>
well
,
be
a
man
of
just
an
equal
temper
,
I
admit
that
.
<EOS>
still
Mr.
Superintendent
may
have
remember
 
never
mind
what
he
may
have
remember
.
<EOS>
the
devil
take
him
!
  
<EOS>
the
next
and
last
step
in
the
investigation
bring
matter
,
as
they
say
,
to
a
crisis
.
<EOS>
the
officer
have
an
interview
(
at
which
I
be
present
)
with
my
lady
.
<EOS>
after
inform
her
that
the
Diamond
must
have
be
take
by
somebody
in
the
house
,
he
request
permission
for
himself
and
his
man
to
search
the
servant
'
room
and
box
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
My
good
mistress
,
like
the
generous
high
-
bred
woman
she
be
,
refuse
to
let
us
be
treat
like
thief
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
consent
to
make
such
a
return
as
that
,
"
she
say
,
"
for
all
I
owe
to
the
faithful
servant
who
be
employ
in
my
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
make
his
bow
,
with
a
look
in
my
direction
,
which
say
plainly
,
"
why
employ
me
,
if
you
be
to
tie
my
hand
in
this
way
?
"
<EOS>
as
head
of
the
servant
,
I
feel
directly
that
we
be
bind
,
in
justice
to
all
party
,
not
to
profit
by
our
mistress
's
generosity
.
<EOS>
"
We
gratefully
thank
your
ladyship
,
"
I
say
;
"
but
we
ask
your
permission
to
do
what
be
right
in
this
matter
by
give
up
our
key
.
<EOS>
when
Gabriel
Betteredge
set
the
example
,
"
say
I
,
stop
Superintendent
Seegrave
at
the
door
<EOS>
,
"
the
rest
of
the
servant
will
follow
,
I
promise
you
.
<EOS>
there
be
my
key
,
to
begin
with
!
<EOS>
"
My
lady
take
me
by
the
hand
,
and
thank
me
with
the
tear
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
would
I
not
have
give
,
at
that
moment
,
for
the
privilege
of
knock
Superintendent
Seegrave
down
!
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
promise
for
them
,
the
other
servant
follow
my
lead
,
sorely
against
the
grain
,
of
course
,
but
all
take
the
view
that
I
take
.
<EOS>
the
woman
be
a
sight
to
see
,
while
the
police
-
officer
be
rummage
among
their
thing
.
<EOS>
the
cook
look
as
if
she
could
grill
Mr.
Superintendent
alive
on
a
furnace
,
and
the
other
woman
look
as
if
they
could
eat
him
when
he
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
search
over
,
and
no
diamond
or
sign
of
a
Diamond
be
find
,
of
course
,
anywhere
,
Superintendent
Seegrave
retire
to
my
little
room
to
consider
with
himself
what
he
be
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
man
have
now
be
hour
in
the
house
,
and
have
not
advance
us
one
inch
towards
a
discovery
of
how
the
Moonstone
have
be
take
,
or
of
whom
we
be
to
suspect
as
the
thief
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
police
-
officer
be
still
ponder
in
solitude
,
I
be
send
for
to
see
Mr.
Franklin
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
to
my
unutterable
astonishment
,
just
as
my
hand
be
on
the
door
,
it
be
suddenly
open
from
the
inside
,
and
out
walk
Rosanna
Spearman
!
  
<EOS>
after
the
library
have
be
sweep
and
clean
in
the
morning
,
neither
first
nor
second
housemaid
have
any
business
in
that
room
at
any
later
period
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
I
stop
Rosanna
Spearman
,
and
charge
her
with
a
breach
of
domestic
discipline
on
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
may
you
want
in
the
library
at
this
time
of
day
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
drop
one
of
his
ring
up
-
stair
,
"
say
Rosanna
;
"
and
I
have
be
into
the
library
to
give
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
girl
's
face
be
all
in
a
flush
as
she
make
me
that
answer
;
and
she
walk
away
with
a
toss
of
her
head
and
a
look
of
self
-
importance
which
I
be
quite
at
a
loss
to
account
for
.
<EOS>
the
proceeding
in
the
house
have
doubtless
upset
all
the
woman
-
servant
more
or
less
;
but
none
of
them
have
go
clean
out
of
their
natural
character
,
as
Rosanna
,
to
all
appearance
,
have
now
go
out
of
hers
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
Mr.
Franklin
write
at
the
library
-
table
.
<EOS>
He
ask
for
a
conveyance
to
the
railway
station
the
moment
I
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
inform
me
that
we
now
have
the
resolute
side
of
him
uppermost
once
more
.
<EOS>
the
man
make
of
cotton
have
disappear
;
and
the
man
make
of
iron
sit
before
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
to
London
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
to
telegraph
to
London
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
convince
my
aunt
that
we
must
have
a
clever
head
than
Superintendent
Seegrave
's
to
help
us
;
and
I
have
get
her
permission
to
despatch
a
telegram
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
Chief
Commissioner
of
Police
,
and
the
Commissioner
can
lay
his
hand
on
the
right
man
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
Diamond

<EOS>
talk
of
mystery
,
by
-
the
-
bye

"
say
Mr.
Franklin
,
drop
his
voice
,
"
I
have
another
word
to
say
to
you
before
you
go
to
the
stable
.
<EOS>
do
not
breathe
a
word
of
it
to
anybody
as
yet
;
but
either
Rosanna
Spearman
's
head
be
not
quite
right
,
or
I
be
afraid
she
know
more
about
the
Moonstone
than
she
ought
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
tell
whether
I
be
more
startled
or
distressed
at
hear
him
say
that
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
young
,
I
may
have
confess
as
much
to
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
but
when
you
be
old
,
you
acquire
one
excellent
habit
.
<EOS>
in
case
where
you
do
not
see
your
way
clearly
,
you
hold
your
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
come
in
here
with
a
ring
I
drop
in
my
bed
-
room
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
have
thank
her
,
of
course
I
expect
her
to
go
.
<EOS>
instead
of
that
,
she
stand
opposite
to
me
at
the
table
,
look
at
me
in
the
oddest
manner
 
half
frightened
,
and
half
familiar
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
make
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
strange
thing
about
the
Diamond
,
sir
,
"
she
say
,
in
a
curiously
sudden
,
headlong
way
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
yes
,
it
be
,
"
and
wonder
what
be
come
next
.
<EOS>
upon
my
honour
,
Betteredge
,
I
think
she
must
be
wrong
in
the
head
!
<EOS>
She
say
,
"
They
will
never
find
the
Diamond
,
sir
,
will
they
?
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
nor
the
person
who
take
it
 
I
will
answer
for
that
.

"
<EOS>
She
actually
nod
and
smile
at
me
!
<EOS>
before
I
could
ask
her
what
she
mean
,
we
hear
your
step
outside
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
be
afraid
of
your
catching
her
here
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
she
change
colour
,
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
what
on
earth
do
it
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
tell
him
the
girl
's
story
,
even
then
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
almost
as
good
as
tell
him
that
she
be
the
thief
.
<EOS>
besides
,
even
if
I
have
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
,
and
even
suppose
she
be
the
thief
,
the
reason
why
she
should
let
out
her
secret
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
,
would
have
be
still
as
far
to
seek
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
get
the
poor
girl
into
a
scrape
,
merely
because
she
have
a
flighty
way
with
her
,
and
talk
very
strangely
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
and
yet
if
she
have
say
to
,
the
superintendent
<EOS>
what
she
say
to
me
,
fool
as
he
be
,
I
be
afraid

He
stop
there
,
and
leave
the
rest
unspoken
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
good
way
,
sir
,
"
I
say
,
"
will
be
for
me
to
say
two
word
privately
to
my
mistress
about
it
at
the
first
opportunity

<EOS>
My
lady
have
a
very
friendly
interest
in
Rosanna

the
girl
may
only
have
be
forward

foolish
,
after
all

when
there
be
a
mess
of
any
kind

the

side

give
the
poor
wretch
a
kind
of
importance
in
their
own
eye

<EOS>
if
there
be
anybody
ill
,
trust
the
woman
for
prophesy
that
the
person
will
die

<EOS>
if
it

lose

trust
them
for
prophesy
that
it

never

again

"
  
<EOS>
this
view
(
which
I
be
bind
to
say
<EOS>
,
I
think
a
probable
view
myself
,
on
reflection
)
seem
to
relieve
Mr.
Franklin
mightily
:
he
fold
up
his
telegram
,
and
dismiss
the
subject
.
<EOS>
on
my
way
to
the
stable
,
to
order
the
pony
-
chaise
,
I
look
in
at
the
servant
'
hall
,
where
they
be
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
be
not
among
them
.
<EOS>
on
inquiry
,
I
find
that
she
have
be
suddenly
take
ill
,
and
have
go
up
-
stair
to
her
own
room
to
lie
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
curious
!
<EOS>
She
look
well
enough
when
I
see
her
last
,
"
I
remark
.
  
<EOS>
Penelope
follow
me
out
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
talk
in
that
way
before
the
rest
of
them
,
father
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
only
make
them
harder
on
Rosanna
than
ever
.
<EOS>
the
poor
thing
be
break
her
heart
about
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
be
another
view
of
the
girl
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
possible
for
Penelope
to
be
right
,
the
explanation
of
Rosanna
's
strange
language
and
behaviour
may
have
be
all
in
this
 
that
she
do
not
care
what
she
say
,
so
long
as
she
could
surprise
Mr.
Franklin
into
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
grant
that
to
be
the
right
reading
of
the
riddle
,
it
account
,
perhaps
,
for
her
flighty
,
self
-
conceite
manner
when
she
pass
me
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
though
he
have
only
say
three
word
,
still
she
have
carry
her
point
,
and
Mr.
Franklin
have
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
the
pony
harness
myself
.
<EOS>
in
the
infernal
network
of
mystery
and
uncertainty
that
now
surround
us
,
I
declare
it
be
a
relief
to
observe
how
well
the
buckle
and
strap
understand
each
other
!
<EOS>
when
you
have
see
the
pony
back
into
the
shaft
of
the
chaise
,
you
have
see
something
there
be
no
doubt
about
.
<EOS>
and
that
,
let
me
tell
you
,
be
become
a
treat
of
the
rare
kind
in
our
household
.
  
<EOS>
go
round
with
the
chaise
to
the
front
door
,
I
find
not
only
Mr.
Franklin
,
but
Mr.
Godfrey
and
Superintendent
Seegrave
also
wait
for
me
on
the
step
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Superintendent
's
reflection
(
after
fail
to
find
the
Diamond
in
the
servant
'
room
or
box
)
have
lead
him
,
it
appear
,
to
an
entirely
new
conclusion
.
<EOS>
still
stick
to
his
first
text
,
namely
,
that
somebody
in
the
house
have
steal
the
jewel
,
our
experienced
officer
be
now
of
the
opinion
that
the
thief
(
he
be
wise
enough
not
to
name
poor
Penelope
,
whatever
he
may
privately
think
of
her
!
)
<EOS>
have
be
act
in
concert
with
the
Indians
;
and
he
accordingly
propose
shift
his
inquiry
to
the
juggler
in
the
prison
at
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
hear
of
this
new
move
,
Mr.
Franklin
have
volunteer
to
take
the
superintendent
back
to
the
town
,
from
which
he
could
telegraph
to
London
as
easily
as
from
our
station
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
still
devoutly
believe
in
Mr.
Seegrave
,
and
greatly
interested
in
witness
the
examination
of
the
Indians
,
have
beg
leave
to
accompany
the
officer
to
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
two
inferior
policeman
be
to
be
leave
at
the
house
,
in
case
anything
happen
.
<EOS>
the
other
be
to
go
back
with
the
superintendent
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
so
the
four
place
in
the
pony
-
chaise
be
just
fill
.
  
<EOS>
before
he
take
the
rein
to
drive
off
,
Mr.
Franklin
walk
me
away
a
few
step
out
of
hearing
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
wait
to
telegraph
to
London
,
"
he
say
,
"
<EOS>
till
I
see
what
come
of
our
examination
of
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
My
own
conviction
be
,
that
this
muddle
-
head
local
police
-
officer
be
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
,
and
be
simply
try
to
gain
time
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
any
of
the
servant
be
in
league
with
the
Indians
be
a
preposterous
absurdity
,
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
keep
about
the
house
,
Betteredge
,
till
I
come
back
,
and
try
what
you
can
make
of
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
you
to
do
anything
degrade
to
your
own
self
-
respect
,
or
anything
cruel
towards
the
girl
.
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
to
exercise
your
observation
more
carefully
than
usual
.
<EOS>
We
will
make
as
light
of
it
as
we
can
before
my
aunt
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
more
important
matter
than
you
may
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
be
a
matter
of
twenty
thousand
pound
,
sir
,
"
I
say
,
think
of
the
value
of
the
Diamond
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
matter
of
quiet
Rachel
's
mind
,
"
answer
Mr.
Franklin
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
uneasy
about
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
leave
me
suddenly
;
as
if
he
desire
to
cut
short
any
further
talk
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
understand
why
.
<EOS>
further
talk
may
have
let
me
into
the
secret
of
what
Miss
Rachel
have
say
to
him
on
the
terrace
.
  
<EOS>
so
they
drive
away
to
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
I
be
ready
enough
,
in
the
girl
's
own
interest
,
to
have
a
little
talk
with
Rosanna
in
private
.
<EOS>
but
the
needful
opportunity
fail
to
present
itself
.
<EOS>
She
only
come
downstairs
again
at
tea
-
time
.
<EOS>
when
she
do
appear
,
she
be
flighty
and
excited
,
have
what
they
call
an
hysterical
attack
,
take
a
dose
of
sal
-
volatile
by
my
lady
's
order
,
and
be
send
back
to
her
bed
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
wear
on
to
its
end
drearily
and
miserably
enough
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
still
keep
her
room
,
declare
that
she
be
too
ill
to
come
down
to
dinner
that
day
.
<EOS>
My
lady
be
in
such
low
spirit
about
her
daughter
,
that
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
make
her
additionally
anxious
,
by
report
what
Rosanna
Spearman
have
say
to
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
Penelope
persist
in
believe
that
she
be
to
be
forthwith
try
,
sentence
,
and
transport
for
theft
.
<EOS>
the
other
woman
take
to
their
Bibles
and
hymn
-
book
,
and
look
as
sour
as
verjuice
over
their
reading
 
a
result
,
which
I
have
observe
,
in
my
sphere
of
life
,
to
follow
generally
on
the
performance
of
act
of
piety
at
unaccustomed
period
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
have
not
even
heart
enough
to
open
my
ROBINSON
crusoe
.
<EOS>
I
go
out
into
the
yard
,
and
,
be
hard
up
for
a
little
cheerful
society
,
set
my
chair
by
the
kennels
,
and
talk
to
the
dog
.
  
<EOS>
half
an
hour
before
dinner
-
time
,
the
two
gentleman
come
back
from
Frizinghall
,
have
arrange
with
Superintendent
Seegrave
that
he
be
to
return
to
us
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
They
have
call
on
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
the
indian
traveller
,
at
his
present
residence
,
near
the
town
.
<EOS>
at
Mr.
Franklin
's
request
,
he
have
kindly
give
them
the
benefit
of
his
knowledge
of
the
language
,
in
deal
with
those
two
,
out
of
the
three
Indians
,
who
know
nothing
of
English
.
<EOS>
the
examination
,
conduct
carefully
,
and
at
great
length
,
have
end
in
nothing
;
not
the
shadow
of
a
reason
be
discover
for
suspect
the
juggler
of
have
tamper
with
any
of
our
servant
.
<EOS>
on
reach
that
conclusion
,
Mr.
Franklin
have
send
his
telegraphic
message
to
London
,
and
there
the
matter
now
rest
till
to
-
morrow
come
.
  
<EOS>
so
much
for
the
history
of
the
day
that
follow
the
birthday
.
<EOS>
not
a
glimmer
of
light
have
break
in
on
us
,
so
far
.
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
after
,
however
,
the
darkness
lift
a
little
.
<EOS>
how
,
and
with
what
result
,
you
shall
presently
see
.
    
<EOS>
the
Thursday
night
pass
,
and
nothing
happen
.
<EOS>
with
the
Friday
morning
come
two
piece
of
news
.
  
<EOS>
item
<EOS>
the
first
:
the
baker
's
man
declare
he
have
meet
Rosanna
Spearman
,
on
the
previous
afternoon
,
with
a
thick
veil
on
,
walk
towards
Frizinghall
by
the
foot
-
path
way
over
the
moor
.
<EOS>
It
seem
strange
that
anybody
should
be
mistake
about
Rosanna
,
whose
shoulder
mark
her
out
pretty
plainly
,
poor
thing
 
<EOS>
but
mistake
the
man
<EOS>
must
have
be
;
for
Rosanna
,
as
you
know
,
have
be
all
the
Thursday
afternoon
ill
up
-
stair
in
her
room
.
  
<EOS>
item
the
second
come
through
the
postman
.
<EOS>
Worthy
Mr.
Candy
have
say
one
more
of
his
many
unlucky
thing
,
when
he
drive
off
in
the
rain
on
the
birthday
night
,
and
tell
me
that
a
doctor
's
skin
be
waterproof
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
his
skin
,
the
wet
have
get
through
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
catch
a
chill
that
night
,
and
be
now
down
with
a
fever
.
<EOS>
the
last
account
,
bring
by
the
postman
,
represent
him
to
be
light
-
head
 
<EOS>
talk
nonsense
as
glibly
,
poor
man
,
in
his
delirium
as
he
often
talk
it
in
his
sober
sense
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
sorry
for
the
little
doctor
;
but
Mr.
Franklin
appear
to
regret
his
illness
,
chiefly
on
Miss
Rachel
's
account
.
<EOS>
from
what
he
say
to
my
lady
,
while
I
be
in
the
room
at
breakfast
-
time
,
he
appear
to
think
that
Miss
Rachel
 
if
the
suspense
about
the
Moonstone
be
not
soon
set
at
rest
 
may
stand
in
urgent
need
of
the
good
medical
advice
at
our
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
Breakfast
have
not
be
over
long
,
when
a
telegram
from
Mr.
Blake
,
the
elder
,
arrive
,
in
answer
to
his
son
.
<EOS>
It
inform
us
that
he
have
lay
hand
(
by
help
of
his
friend
,
the
Commissioner
)
on
the
right
man
to
help
us
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
him
be
Sergeant
Cuff
;
and
the
arrival
of
him
from
London
may
be
expect
by
the
morning
train
.
  
<EOS>
at
read
the
name
of
the
new
police
-
officer
,
Mr.
Franklin
give
a
start
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
he
have
hear
some
curious
anecdote
about
Sergeant
Cuff
,
from
his
father
's
lawyer
,
during
his
stay
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
hope
we
be
see
the
end
of
our
anxiety
already
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
if
half
the
story
I
have
hear
be
true
,
when
it
come
to
unravel
a
mystery
,
there
be
not
the
equal
in
England
of
Sergeant
Cuff
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
all
get
excited
and
impatient
as
the
time
draw
near
for
the
appearance
of
this
renowned
and
capable
character
.
<EOS>
Superintendent
Seegrave
,
return
to
us
at
his
appoint
time
,
and
hear
that
the
Sergeant
be
expect
,
instantly
shut
himself
up
in
a
room
,
with
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
to
make
note
of
the
Report
which
would
be
certainly
expect
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
like
to
have
go
to
the
station
myself
,
to
fetch
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
but
my
lady
's
carriage
and
horse
be
not
to
be
think
of
,
even
for
the
celebrated
Cuff
;
and
the
pony
-
chaise
be
require
later
for
Mr.
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
He
deeply
regret
be
oblige
to
leave
his
aunt
at
such
an
anxious
time
;
and
he
kindly
put
off
the
hour
of
his
departure
till
as
late
as
the
last
train
,
for
the
purpose
of
hear
what
the
clever
London
police
-
officer
thought
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
but
on
Friday
night
he
must
be
in
town
,
have
a
Ladies
'
charity
,
in
difficulty
,
wait
to
consult
him
on
Saturday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
time
come
for
the
Sergeant
's
arrival
,
I
go
down
to
the
gate
to
look
out
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
a
fly
from
the
railway
drive
up
as
I
reach
the
lodge
;
and
out
get
a
grizzled
,
elderly
man
,
so
miserably
lean
that
he
look
as
if
he
have
not
get
an
ounce
of
flesh
on
his
bone
in
any
part
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
dress
all
in
decent
black
,
with
a
white
cravat
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
as
sharp
as
a
hatchet
,
and
the
skin
of
it
be
as
yellow
and
dry
and
wither
as
an
autumn
leaf
.
<EOS>
His
eye
,
of
a
steely
light
grey
,
have
a
very
disconcerting
trick
,
when
they
encounter
your
eye
,
of
look
as
if
they
expect
something
more
from
you
than
you
be
aware
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
His
walk
be
soft
;
his
voice
be
melancholy
;
his
long
lanky
finger
be
hook
like
claw
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
be
a
parson
,
or
an
undertaker
 
or
anything
else
you
like
,
except
what
he
really
be
.
<EOS>
a
more
complete
opposite
to
Superintendent
Seegrave
than
Sergeant
Cuff
,
and
a
less
comforting
officer
to
look
at
,
for
a
family
in
distress
,
I
defy
you
to
discover
,
search
where
you
may
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
this
Lady
Verinder
's
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
this
way
,
sir
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
our
road
to
the
house
,
I
mention
my
name
and
position
in
the
family
,
to
satisfy
him
that
he
may
speak
to
me
about
the
business
on
which
my
lady
be
to
employ
him
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
<EOS>
do
he
say
about
the
business
,
however
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
He
admire
the
ground
,
and
remark
that
he
feel
the
sea
air
very
brisk
and
refreshing
.
<EOS>
I
privately
wonder
,
on
my
side
,
how
the
celebrated
Cuff
have
get
his
reputation
.
<EOS>
We
reach
the
house
,
in
the
temper
of
two
strange
dog
,
couple
up
together
for
the
first
time
in
their
life
by
the
same
chain

the
Musk
Rose
with
his
lanky
finger
,
and
speak
to
it
as
if
he

<EOS>
this

You

the
Sergeant
,
on
whose
mind
the
gravel
path
of
our
rosery
seem
to
dwell
unpleasantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
an
odd
taste
,
sir

"
I
venture
to
say
,
"
for
a
man
in
your
line
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
look
about
you
(
which
most
people
will
not
do
)
,
"
say
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
you
will
see
that
the
nature
of
a
man
's
taste
be
,
most
time
,
as
opposite
as
possible
to
the
nature
of
a
man
's
business

<EOS>
show
me
any
two
thing
more
opposite
one
from
the
other

a

I
will
correct
my
taste
accordingly

late

find
the

not
you

<EOS>
I
think
so

<EOS>
He
have
see
her

I

have
see
her
,
though
we
know
which
way
to
look
,
and
he
do
not
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
him
rather
a
quick
man
than
he
appear
to
be
at
first
sight

<EOS>
the
Sergeant
's
appearance
,

the
Sergeant

errand
 
<EOS>
one
or
both
 
seem
to
cause
my

some
little
embarrassment

She
be
,
for

first

at

loss
what
to

at

<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
put
her
at
her
ease
directly
.
<EOS>
He
ask
if
any
other
person
have
be
employ
about
the
robbery
before
we
send
for
him

hear
that
another

<EOS>
My

lead

before

relieve
his

on
the

why

small
than

on
be
present
to
Sergeant
Cuff

I
can
not
undertake
to
explain

<EOS>
I
can
only
state
the
fact
.
<EOS>
They
retire
together
;
and
remain
a
weary
long
time
shut
up
from
all
mortal
intrusion
.
<EOS>
when
they
come
out
,
Mr.

<EOS>
while
I

about
in

I
look
at
the
great
Cuff

<EOS>
the
great
Cuff
,
on
his
side
,
look
at
Superintendent
Seegrave
in
that
quietly
expect
way
which
I
have
already
notice
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
affirm
that
he
be
on
the
watch
for
his
brother
officer
's
speedy
appearance
in
the
character
of
<EOS>
an
Ass
 
I
can
only
say
that
I
strongly
suspect
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
lead
the
way
up

stair
.
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
go
softly
all
over
the
indian
cabinet
and
all
round
the
"
boudoir
;
"
ask
question
(
occasionally
only
of
Mr.
Superintendent
,
and
continually
of
me
)
,
the
drift
of
which
I
believe
to
have
be
equally
unintelligible
to
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
in
due
time
,
his
course
bring
him
to
the
door
,
and
put
him
face
to
face
with
the
decorative
painting
that
you
know
of
.
<EOS>
He
lay
one
lean
inquire
finger
on
the
small
smear
,
just
under
the
lock
,
which
Superintendent
Seegrave
have
already
notice
,
when
he
reprove
the

for
all
crowd
together
into

<EOS>
"
that
be
a
pity

say
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
how
do
it
happen

"
  
<EOS>
He
put
the
question
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
answer
that
the
woman

servant
have
crowd
into
the
room
on
the
previous
morning
,

that
some
of
their
petticoat
have
do
the
mischief

them
out

I
add
,

the
good
of
it

the
gravel
walk
in
the
rosery

give
us
,
in
his
melancholy
way

the
first
taste
of
his
quality

we
have
have
yet

<EOS>
in

dirty
way

dirty
little
world

I
have
never

<EOS>
before

you
happen
to
know
anything
about

you
have
do
it
by
accident

with
that
answer
,
she
turn
away
,
and
shut
herself
up
again
in
her
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
this
time
,
I
hear
her
 
as
Penelope
have
hear
her
before
 
burst
out
cry
as
soon
as
she
be
alone
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
look
at
the
Sergeant
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
Mr.
Franklin
,
who
stand
near
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
even
more
sorely
distressed
at
what
have
pass
than
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
be
uneasy
about
her
,

he
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
now
you
see
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Verinder
appear
to
be
a
little
out
of
temper
about
the
loss
of
her
Diamond

the
Sergeant

"
It
be
a
valuable
jewel

here
be
the
excuse

for

previous
day

could
not
have
have
my
interest
in

it
 
for

a
perfect
stranger

<EOS>
a
kind
of
cold
shudder
run
through
me
,
which
I
could
not
account
for
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
now
,
that
I
must
have
get
my
first
suspicion
,
at
that
moment
,
of
a
new
light
(
and
horrid
light
)
have
suddenly
fall
on
the
case
,
in
the
mind
of
Sergeant
Cuff
 
purely
and
entirely
in
consequence
of
what
he
have
see
in
Miss
Rachel
,

hear
from
Miss
Rachel
,
at
that
first
interview
between
them

have
manage
this

among
other
thing
,
he
have
,
by
his
own
confession

set
the

back
up

<EOS>
It
be
very
important
to
smooth
them
down
again

<EOS>
tell
your
daughter
,
and
tell
the
rest
of

these
two
thing

with
my
compliment

first
,
that
I
have
no
evidence
before
me
,
yet
,
that
the
Diamond
have
be
steal
;
I
only
know
that
the
Diamond
have
be
lose
.
<EOS>
second
,
that
my
business
here
with
the
servant
be
simply
to
ask
them
to
lay
their
head
together
and
help
me
to
find
it

<EOS>
My
experience
of
the
woman

servant
,
when
Superintendent
Seegrave
lay
his
embargo
on
their
room

come
in
handy
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
make
so
bold
,
Sergeant
,
as
to
tell
the
woman
a
third
thing
?

I
ask
.
"
<EOS>
be
they
free
(
with
your
compliment

to
fidget
up

downstairs

whisk
in

out

room

if
the
fit
take
them

<EOS>
I
do
it
in
less
than
five
minute
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
difficulty
when
I
come
to
the
bit
about
the
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
take
a
pretty
stiff
exertion
of
my
authority
,
as
chief
,
to
prevent
the
whole
of
the
female
household
from
follow
me
and
penelope
up
-
stair
,
in
the
character
of
volunteer
witness
in
a
burn
fever
of
anxiety
to
help
Sergeant
Cuff

<EOS>
the
Sergeant
seem
to
approve
of
Penelope
.
<EOS>
He
become
a
trifle
less
dreary
;
and
he
look
much
as
he
have
look
when
he
notice
the
white
musk
rise
in
the
flower

garden

<EOS>
here
be
my
daughter

evidence

"
have
grow
a
little
in
importance
since
you
notice
it
last
.
<EOS>
at
the
present
stage
of
the
inquiry
there
be
,
as
I
take
it
,
three
discovery
to
make
,
start
from

<EOS>
find
out
(

)
whether
there

if

you
,
you
have
not

the
hand

hit
hard
by
the
celebrated
Cuff

he
hit
back
smartly
,
to
the
good
of
his
ability

on
leave

"
I

Mr.

I
have

remark

such
a
thing

high

it

<EOS>
have
return
his
brother
-
officer
's
compliment
in
those
term
,
Sergeant
Cuff
wheel
about
,
and
walk
away
to
the
window
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
and
I
wait
to
see
what
be
come
next
.
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
stand
at
the
window
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
look
out
,
and
whistle
the
tune
of
"
the
last
Rose
of
Summer
"
softly
to
himself
.
<EOS>
later
in
the
proceeding
,
I
discover
that
he
only
forget
his
manner
so
far
as
to
whistle
,
when
his
mind
be
hard
at
work
,
see
its
way
inch
by
inch
to
its
own
private
end
,
on
which
occasion
"
the
last
Rose
of
Summer
"
evidently
help
and
encourage
him
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
fit
in
somehow
with
his
character
.
<EOS>
It
remind
him
,
you
see
,
of
his
favourite
rose
,
and
,
as
he
whistle
it
,
it
be
the
most
melancholy
tune
go
.
  
<EOS>
turn
from
the
window
,
after
a
minute
or
two
,
the
Sergeant
walk
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
stop
there
,
deep
in
thought
,
with
his
eye
on
Miss
Rachel
's
bed
-
room
door

<EOS>
after
a
little
he
rouse
himself
,
nod
his
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
that
will
do
,
"
and
,
address
me
,
<EOS>
ask
for
ten
minute
'
conversation

my
mistress

at
her
ladyship

early
convenience

<EOS>
leave
the
room
with
this
message

I
hear
Mr.
Franklin
ask
the
Sergeant
a
question
,
and
stop
to
hear
the
answer
also
at
the
threshold
of
the
door

"
Can
you
guess

inquire
Mr.

We
both
start
at
that
extraordinary

both
earnestly
beg
him
to
tell
us
what
he
mean

wait
a
little

the
Sergeant

piece

<EOS>
I
find
my
lady
in

start

look
annoyed

ask

can
not

I
feel
at

loss

understand
this

show
it
plainly

suppose
,
in
my
face

My
lady
be
so
good

to
explain
herself

"
I
be
afraid

shaken

I
hardly
know
what
to

to
this

the
more
I

well
I
like
him

rally
a
little
after

high
courage

already

I
can
not

I
remember
in
my
mistress
since
the
time
when
she
be
a
young
girl

<EOS>
I
go
back
to
the

boudoir

<EOS>
Mr.

,
and
join
Mr.

whose
time
for
departure
be
now

<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
<EOS>
and
I
go

's
room

<EOS>
I
declare
my
lady
turn
a
shade
paler
at
the
sight
of
him
!
<EOS>
She
command
herself
,
however
,
in
other
respect
,
and
ask
the
Sergeant
if
he
have
any
objection
to
my
be
present
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
good
as
to
add
,
that
I
be
her
trust
adviser
,
as
well
as
her
old
servant
,
and
that
in
anything
which
relate
to
the
household
I
be
the
person
whom
it
may
be
most
profitable
to
consult
.
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
politely
answer
that
he
would
take
my
presence
as
a
favour
,
have
something
to
say
about
the
servant
in
general
,
and
have
find
my
experience
in
that
quarter
already
of
some
use
to
him
.
<EOS>
My
lady
point
to
two
chair
,
and
we
set
in
for
our
conference
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
form
an
opinion
on
this
case
,
"
say
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
which
I
beg
your
ladyship
's
permission
to
keep
to
myself
for
the

<EOS>
My
business

be
to
mention
what
I
have
discover
upstairs
in
Miss
Verinder

on
do
next
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
go
into
the
matter
of
the
smear
on
the
paint
,
and
state
the
conclusion
he
draw
from
it
 
just
as
he
have
state
them
(
only
with
great
respect
of
language
)
to
Superintendent
Seegrave
.
<EOS>
"
one
thing

in
conclusion

be
certain

<EOS>
the
Diamond

miss
out
of
the
drawer
in
the
cabinet
.
<EOS>
another
thing
be
next
to
certain
.
<EOS>
the
mark
from
the
smear
on
the
door
must
be
on
some
article
of
dress
belong
to
somebody
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
We
must
discover
that
article
of
dress
before
we
go
a
step
further
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
that
discovery
,
"
remark
my
mistress
,
"
imply
,
I
presume
,
the
discovery
of
the
thief
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
ladyship
's
pardon
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
the
Diamond
be
steal
.
<EOS>
I
only
say
,
at
present
,
that
the
Diamond
be
miss
.
<EOS>
the
discovery
of
the
stained
dress
may
lead
the
way
to
find
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
understand
this
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sergeant
Cuff
understand
it
,
my
lady
,
"
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
propose
to
discover
the
stained
dress
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
my
mistress
,
address
herself
once
more
to
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
My
good
servant
,
who
have
be
with
me
for
year
,
have
,
I
be
ashamed
to
say
,
have
their
box
and
room
search
already
by
the
other
officer
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
and
will
not
permit
them
to
be
insult
in
that
way
a
second
time
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
there
be
a
mistress
to
serve
!
<EOS>
there
be
a
woman
in
ten
thousand
,
if
you
like
!
)
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
very
point
I
be
about
to
put
to
your
ladyship
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
the
other
officer
have
do
a
world
of
harm
to
this
inquiry
,
by
let
the
servant
see
that
he
suspect
them
.
<EOS>
if
I
give
them
cause
to
think
themselves
suspect
a
second
time
,
there
be
no
knowing
what
obstacle
they
may
not
throw
in
my
way
 
the
woman
especially
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
their
box
must
be
search
again
 
for
this
plain
reason
,
that
the
first
investigation
only
look
for
the
Diamond
,
and
that
the
second
investigation
must
look
for
the
stained
dress
.
<EOS>
I
quite
agree
with
you
,
my
lady
,
that
the
servant
'
feeling
ought
to
be
consult
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
equally
clear
that
the
servant
'
wardrobe
ought
to
be
search
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
look
very
like
a
dead
-
lock
.
<EOS>
My
lady
say
so
,
in
choicer
language
than
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
a
plan
to
meet
the
difficulty
,
"
say
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
if
your
ladyship
will
consent
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
propose
explain
the
case
to
the
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
woman
will
think
themselves
suspect
directly

I
say
,
interrupt
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
woman
will
not

Mr.
Betteredge

answer
the
Sergeant
,
"
if
I
can
tell
them
I
be
go
to

mere
formality

he
add
,
with
a
side
look
at
my
mistress

the
servant
will
accept
it
as
even
deal
between
them
and
their
better
;

,
instead
of
hinder
the
investigation

they
will
make
a
point
of
honour
of
assist
it

<EOS>
I
see
the
truth
of
that
.
<EOS>
My

,
after
her
first
surprise
be
over

the
truth
of
it
also

You
be

her

very
unexpected
question

"
have

too

my

with
a
look
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
the
only
gentleman

my

Mr.
Blake

Mr.
Ablewhite

<EOS>
there
be
not
the

fear
of
a
refusal
from
any

"
  
<EOS>
I
remind
my
lady
here
that
Mr.
Godfrey
be
go
away
.
<EOS>
as
I
say
the
word
,
Mr.
Godfrey
himself
knock
at
the
door
to
say
good
-
bye
,
and
be
follow
in
by
Mr.
Franklin

the
station

<EOS>
My
lady
explain
the
difficulty

<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
settle
it
directly
.
<EOS>
He
call
to
Samuel
,
through
the
window
,
to
take
his
portmanteau
up
-
stair
again
,
and
he
then
put
the
key
himself
into
Sergeant
Cuff
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
My
luggage

follow
me
to
London

he
say
,
"
when

over

<EOS>
the
Sergeant
receive
the
key
with
a
become
apology
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
put
you
to
any
inconvenience

sir

for
a
mere
formality

the

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
,
after
take
leave
of
my
lady
,
in
a
most
sympathising
manner
,
leave
a
farewell
message
for
Miss
Rachel
,
the
term
of
which
make
it
clear
to
my
mind
that
he
have
not
take
no
for
an
answer
,
and
that
he
mean
to
put
the
marriage
question
to
her
once
more
,
at
the
next
opportunity

<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin

his
good
acknowledgment

His
view

readiness

their
lead

call
the
servant
together

the
search

the
stained
dress

<EOS>
My
lady
's
unaccountable
objection
to
the
Sergeant
seem
to
make
our
conference
more
distasteful
to
her
than
ever

soon

alone
again

"
I

your

"
before

I
should
like

article

able
to
account

there
will

"
why
do
you

my

<EOS>
"
the
last

prison

"
  
<EOS>
after
that
,
there
be
no
help
for
it
,
but
to
tell
him
the
truth
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
dwelt
strongly
on
Rosanna
's
good
conduct
in
her
service
,
and
on
the
high
opinion
entertain
of
her
by
the
matron
at
the
reformatory

<EOS>
"
You
do
not
suspect

I
hope

"
my

add
,
in
conclusion
,
very
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
tell
your

I
do
not

<EOS>
after
that
answer

my

rise
to
go
up

stair

ask
for
Miss
Rachel
's
key

the
Sergeant
be
before

hand
with
me
in
open
the
door
for
her

He
make
a
very
low
bow

My
lady
shudder
as
she
pass
him

<EOS>
We
wait
,
and
wait
,
and
no
key
appear

<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
make
no
remark
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
turn
his
melancholy
face
to
the
window
;
he
put
his
lanky
hand
into
his
pocket
;
and
he
whistle
"
the
last
Rose
of
Summer

softly
to
himself

<EOS>
at
last
,
Samuel
come
in
,
not
with
the
key
,
but
with
a
morsel
of
paper
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
get
at
my
spectacle
,
with
some
fumbling
and
difficulty
,
feel
the
Sergeant
's
dismal
eye
fix
on
me
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
or
three
line
on
the
paper
,
write
in
pencil
by
my
lady
.
<EOS>
They
inform
me
that
Miss
Rachel
flatly
refuse
to
have
her
wardrobe
examine
.
<EOS>
ask
for
her
reason
,
she
have
burst
out
cry
.
<EOS>
ask
again
,
she
have
say
:
"
I
will
not
,
because
I
will
not

<EOS>
I
must
yield
to
force
if
you
use
it
,
but
I
will
yield
to
nothing
else

"
I
understand
my
lady
's
disinclination
to
face
Sergeant
Cuff
with
such
an
answer
from
her
daughter
as
that
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
not
be
too
old
for
the
amiable
weakness
of
youth
,
I
believe
I
should
have
blush
at
the
notion
of
face
him
myself

any
news

Verinder

<EOS>
His
voice
be
not

such
a
perfect
state

discipline

his

when

he
say
it
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
have
hear
something
which
he
expect
to
hear

<EOS>
He
half
angered
and
half
frighten
me
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
could
not
tell
,
but
he
do
it

<EOS>
"
Must
the
search

up

ask

yes

sudden
illness

not

aside

softly
to
himself

off
sharp

down

there

about

,
for

be
I
to

to
him

know
the
shrubbery
be
Mr.
Franklin
's
favourite
walk
;
I
know
he
would
most
likely
turn
that
way
when
he
come
back
from

station

I
know
that
Penelope
have
over

over
again
catch
her

hang
about
there

have
always
declare

I
be
put
between

two
difficulty
of
mention
Penelope

fanciful
notion

mine

of
leave
an
unfortunate
creature

suffer
the
consequence

the
very
serious
consequence

excite
the
suspicion

soul

my
character

pure
pity

I
give
the
Sergeant
the
necessary
explanation

tell
him
that
Rosanna

mad

set
her
heart
on

nothing

I
be
glad

clear
up

slyness

not
think
Rosanna
be
concern
in
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
?
<EOS>
"
I
venture
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
the
corner
of
the
Sergeant
's
melancholy
mouth
curl
up
,
and
he
look
hard
in
my
face
,
just
as
he
have
look
in
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
well
not
tell
you
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
lose
your
head
,
you
know
,
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
begin
to
doubt
whether
I
have
be
one
too
many
for
the
celebrated
Cuff
,
after
all
!
<EOS>
It
be
rather
a
relief
to
me
that
we
be
interrupt
here
by
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
a
message
from
the
cook
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
HAD
ask
to
go
out
,
for
the
usual
reason
,
that
her
head
be
bad
,
and
she
want
a
breath
of
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
at
a
sign
from
the
Sergeant
,
I
say
,
yes
.
"
<EOS>
which
be
the
servant
'
way
out
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
when
the
messenger
have
go
.
<EOS>
I
show
him
the
servant
'
way
out
.
<EOS>
"
lock
the
door
of
your
room
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
;
"
and
if
anybody
ask
for
me
,
say
I
be
in
there
,
compose
my
mind
.
"
<EOS>
He
curl
up
again
at
the
corner
of
the
lip
,
and
disappear
.
  
<EOS>
leave
alone
,
under
those
circumstance
,
a
devour
curiosity
push
me
on
to
make
some
discovery
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
Sergeant
Cuff
's
suspicion
of
Rosanna
have
be
rouse
by
something
that
he
have
find
out
at
his
examination
of
the
servant
in
my
room
.
<EOS>
now
,
the
only
two
servant
(
except
Rosanna
herself
)
who
have
remain
under
examination
for
any
length
of
time
,
be
my
lady
's
own
maid
and
the
first
housemaid
,
those
two
be
also
the
woman
who
have
take
the
lead
in
persecute
their
unfortunate
fellow
-
servant
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
reach
these
conclusion
,
I
look
in
on
them
,
casually
as
it
may
be
,
in
the
servant
'
hall
,
and
,
find
tea
go
forward
,
instantly
invite
myself
to
that
meal
.
<EOS>
(
for
,
NOTA
BENE
,
a
drop
of
tea
be
to
a
woman
's
tongue
what
a
drop
of
oil
be
to
a
waste
lamp
.
)
  
<EOS>
My
reliance
on
the
tea
-
pot
,
as
an
ally
,
do
not
go
unrewarded
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
half
an
hour
I
know
as
much
as
the
Sergeant
himself
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
's
maid
and
the
housemaid
,
have
,
it
appear
,
neither
of
them
believe
in
Rosanna
's
illness
of
the
previous
day
.
<EOS>
these
two
devil
 
<EOS>
I
ask
your
pardon
;
but
how
else
CAN
you
describe
a
couple
of
spiteful
woman
?
 
<EOS>
have
steal
up
-
stair
,
at
interval
during
the
Thursday
afternoon
;
have
try
Rosanna
's
door
,
and
find
it
lock
;
have
knock
,
and
not
be
answer
;
have
listen
,
and
not
hear
a
sound
inside
.
<EOS>
when
the
girl
have
come
down
to
tea
,
and
have
be
send
up
,
still
out
of
sort
,
to
bed
again
,
the
two
devil
aforesaid
have
try
her
door
once
more
,
and
find
it
lock
;
have
look
at
the
keyhole
,
and
find
it
stop
up
;
have
see
a
light
under
the
door
at
midnight
,
and
have
hear
the
crackling
of
a
fire
(
a
fire
in
a
servant
's
bed
-
room
in
the
month
of
June
!
)
<EOS>
at
four
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
all
this
they
have
tell
Sergeant
Cuff
,
who
,
in
return
for
their
anxiety
to
enlighten
him
,
have
eye
them
with
sour
and
suspicious
look
,
and
have
show
them
plainly
that
he
do
not
believe
either
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
hence
,
the
unfavourable
report
of
him
which
these
two
woman
have
bring
out
with
them
from
the
examination
.
<EOS>
hence
,
also
(
without
reckon
the
influence
of
the
tea
-
pot
)
,
their
readiness
to
let
their
tongue
run
to
any
length
on
the
subject
of
the
Sergeant
's
ungracious
behaviour
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
have
have
some
experience
of
the
great
Cuff
's
round
-
about
way
,
and
have
last
see
him
evidently
bent
on
follow
Rosanna
privately
when
she
go
out
for
her
walk
,
it
seem
clear
to
me
that
he
have
think
it
unadvisable
to
let
the
lady
's
maid
and
the
housemaid
know
how
materially
they
have
help
him
.
<EOS>
They
be
just
the
sort
of
woman
,
if
he
have
treat
their
evidence
as
trustworthy
,
to
have
be
puff
up
by
it
,
and
to
have
say
or
do
something
which
would
have
put
Rosanna
Spearman
on
her
guard
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
out
in
the
fine
summer
afternoon
,
very
sorry
for
the
poor
girl
,
and
very
uneasy
in
my
mind
at
the
turn
thing
have
take
.
<EOS>
drift
towards
the
shrubbery
,
some
time
later
,
there
I
meet
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
after
return
from
see
his
cousin
off
at
the
station
,
he
have
be
with
my
lady
,
hold
a
long
conversation
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
him
of
Miss
Rachel
's
unaccountable
refusal
to
let
her
wardrobe
be
examine
;
and
have
put
him
in
such
low
spirit
about
my
young
lady
that
he
seem
to
shrink
from
speak
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
the
family
temper
appear
in
his
face
that
evening
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
experience
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Betteredge
,
"
he
say
,
"
how
do
the
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
suspicion
in
which
we
be
all
live
now
,
agree
with
you
?
<EOS>
do
you
remember
that
morning
when
I
first
come
here
with
the
Moonstone
?
<EOS>
I
wish
to
God
we
have
throw
it
into
the
quicksand
!
"
  
<EOS>
after
break
out
in
that
way
,
he
abstain
from
speak
again
until
he
have
compose
himself
.
<EOS>
We
walk
silently
,
side
by
side
,
for
a
minute
or
two
,
and
then
he
ask
me
what
have
become
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
put
Mr.
Franklin
off
with
the
excuse
of
the
Sergeant
be
in
my
room
,
compose
his
mind
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
exactly
what
have
happen
,
mention
particularly
what
my
lady
's
maid
and
the
house
-
maid
have
say
about
Rosanna
Spearman
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
clear
head
see
the
turn
the
Sergeant
's
suspicion
have
take
,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
tell
me
this
morning
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
one
of
the
tradespeople
declare
he
have
meet
Rosanna
yesterday
,
on
the
footway
to
Frizinghall
,
when
we
suppose
her
to
be
ill
in
her
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
my
aunt
's
maid
and
the
other
woman
have
speak
the
truth
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
the
tradesman
do
meet
her
.
<EOS>
the
girl
's
attack
of
illness
be
a
blind
to
deceive
us
.
<EOS>
She
have
some
guilty
reason
for
go
to
the
town
secretly
.
<EOS>
the
paint
-
stain
dress
be
a
dress
of
hers
;
and
the
fire
hear
crackle
in
her
room
at
four
in
the
morning
be
a
fire
light
to
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
have
steal
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
in
directly
,
and
tell
my
aunt
the
turn
thing
have
take
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
just
yet
,
if
you
please
,
sir
,
"
say
a
melancholy
voice
behind
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
both
turn
about
,
and
find
ourselves
face
to
face
with
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
just
yet
?
"
ask
Mr.
Franklin
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
,
sir
,
if
you
tell
her
ladyship
,
her
ladyship
will
tell
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
she
do
.
<EOS>
what
then
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
say
those
word
with
a
sudden
heat
and
vehemence
,
as
if
the
Sergeant
have
mortally
offend
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
it
be
wise
,
sir
,
"
say
Sergeant
Cuff
,
quietly
,
"
to
put
such
a
question
as
that
to
me
 
at
such
a
time
as
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
moment
's
silence
between
them
:
Mr.
Franklin
walk
close
up
to
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
the
two
look
each
other
straight
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
speak
first
,
drop
his
voice
as
suddenly
as
he
have
raise
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
know
,
Mr.
Cuff
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
you
be
tread
on
delicate
ground
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
the
first
time
,
by
a
good
many
hundred
,
that
I
find
myself
tread
on
delicate
ground
,

answer
the
other
,
as
immovable
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
to
understand
that
you
forbid
me
to
tell
my
aunt
what
have
happen

"
You
be
to
understand

I
throw
up
the
case

Lady
Verinder

I
give
you
leave

"
  
<EOS>
that
settle
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
have
no
choice
but
to
submit
.
<EOS>
He
turn
away
in
anger
 
and
leave
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
stand
there
listen
to
them
,
all
in
a
tremble
;
not
know
whom
to
suspect
,
or
what
to
think
next
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
my
confusion
,
two
thing
,
however
,
be
plain
to
me
.
<EOS>
first
,
that
my
young
lady
be
,
in
some
unaccountable
manner
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
sharp
speech
that
have
pass
between
them
.
<EOS>
second
,
that
they
thoroughly
understand
each
other
,
without
have
previously
exchange
a
word
of
explanation
on
either
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
"
you
have
do
a
very
foolish
thing
in
my
absence
.
<EOS>
You
have
do
a
little
detective
business
on
your
own
account
.
<EOS>
for
the
future
,
perhaps
you
will
be
so
obliging
as
to
do
your
detective
business
along
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
me
by
the
arm
,
and
walk
me
away
with
him
along
the
road
by
which
he
have
come
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
have
deserve
his
reproof
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
go
to
help
him
to
set
trap
for
Rosanna
Spearman
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
thief
or
no
thief
,
legal
or
not
legal
,
I
do
not
care
 
<EOS>
I
pity
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want
of
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
shake
him
off
,
and
stop
short
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
a
little
information
about
the
country
round
here
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
well
object
to
improve
Sergeant
Cuff
in
his
geography
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
any
path
,
in
that
direction
,
lead

sea

beach
from
this
house

ask
the
Sergeant

He
point
,
as
he

to
the
fir

plantation
which
lead
to
the
Shivering
Sand

<EOS>
"
yes

I

,
"
there
be
a
path

it

<EOS>
side
by
side
,
in
the
grey
of
the
summer
evening
,
Sergeant
Cuff
and
I
set
forth
for
the
Shivering
Sand
.
    
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
remain
silent

think
his
own
thought
,
till
we
enter
the
plantation
of
fir
which
lead
to
the
quicksand

there
he
rouse
himself
,
like
a
man

mind
be
make
up

speak
to
me
again

"
Mr.

you

honour

as
you
may
,
I
think

be
of
some
assistance
to
me
before
the
evening
be
out

I
see
no
use
in
our
mystify
one
another
any
longer

and
I
propose
to
set
you
an
example
of
plain
speak
on
my
side

<EOS>
You
be
determined
to
give
me
no
information
to
the
prejudice
of
Rosanna
Spearman

have
be
a
good

you
a

into
trouble

concern

evidence

be
as
plain

nose
on

you
mean

ask

"
I
mean
that
your
lady
can't
prosecute

the
Sergeant

<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
be
simply
an
instrument
in
the
hand
of
another
person

harmless

He
speak
like

man
in

there
be
no
deny
that

still
,
I
feel
something
stir
uneasily

my
mind

can
not

with
a
look

melancholy

It

<EOS>
what
he
mean
by
slip
in
this
extraordinary
question
unaware
,
I
be
at
a
total
loss
to
imagine
.
<EOS>
see
no
possible
injury
to
Rosanna
if
I
own
the
truth
,
I
answer
that
the
girl
have
come
to
us
rather
sparely
provide
with
linen

that
my
lady
,
in
recompense
for
her
good

I
lay
a

a
fortnight
since

"
this
be
a
miserable
world

the
Sergeant

"
<EOS>
human
life
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
be
a
sort
of
target
 
misfortune
be
always
fire
at
it
,
and
always
hit
the
mark
.
<EOS>
but
for
that
outfit
,
we
should
have
discover
a
new
nightgown
or
petticoat
among
Rosanna
's
thing
,
and
have
nail
her
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
at
a
loss
to
follow
me
,
be
you
?
<EOS>
You
have
examine
the
servant
yourself
,
and
you
know
what
discovery
two
of
them
make
outside
Rosanna
's
door
.
<EOS>
surely
you
know
what
the
girl
be
about
yesterday
,
after
she
be
take
ill
?
<EOS>
You
can
not
guess
?
<EOS>
oh
dear
me
,
it
be
as
plain
as
that
strip
of
light
there
,
at
the
end
of
the
tree
.
<EOS>
at
eleven
,
on
Thursday
morning
,
Superintendent
Seegrave
(
who
be
a
mass
of
human
infirmity
)
point
out
to
all
the
woman
servant
the
smear
on
the
door
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
have
her
own
reason
for
suspect
her
own
thing
;
she
take
the
first
opportunity
of
get
to
her
room
,
find
the
paint
-
stain
on
her
night
-
gown
,
or
petticoat
,
or
what
not
,
sham
ill
and
slip
away
to
the
town
,
get
the
material
for
make
a
new
petticoat
or
nightgown
,
make
it
alone
in
her
room
on
the
Thursday
night
light
a
fire
(
not
to
destroy
it
;
two
of
her
fellow
-
servant
be
pry
outside
her
door
,
and
she
know
well
than
to
make
a
smell
of
burning
,
and
to
have
a
lot
of
tinder
to
get
rid
of
)
 
light
a
fire
,
I
say
,
to
dry
and
iron
the
substitute
dress
after
wring
it
out
,
keep
the
stained
dress
hide
(
probably
on
her
)
,
and
be
at
this
moment
occupy
in
make
away
with
it
,
in
some
convenient
place
,
on
that
lonely
bit
of
beach
ahead
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
have
trace
her
this
evening
to
your
fishing
village
,
and
to
one
particular
cottage
,
which
we
may
possibly
have
to
visit
,
before
we
go
back
.
<EOS>
She
stop
in
the
cottage
for
some
time
,
and
she
come
out
with
(
as
I
believe
)
something
hide
under
her
cloak
.
<EOS>
a
cloak
(
on
a
woman
's
back
)
be
an
emblem
of
charity
 
it
cover
a
multitude
of
sin
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
set
off
northward
along
the
coast
,
after
leave
the
cottage
.

your
sea

shore
here
consider
a
fine
speciman

marine
landscape

Mr.
Betteredge

<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
yes

as
shortly
as
may
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
taste
differ
,
"
say
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
look
at
it
from
my
point
of
view
,
I
never
see
a
marine
landscape
that
I
admire
less
.
<EOS>
if
you
happen
to
be
follow
another
person
along
your
sea
-
coast
,
and
if
that
person
happen
to
look
round
,
there
be
not
a
scrap
of
cover
to
hide
you
anywhere
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
choose
between
take
Rosanna
in
custody
on
suspicion
,
or
leave
her
,
for
the
time
be
,
with
her
little
game
in
her
own
hand
.
<EOS>
for
reason
which
I
will
not
trouble
you
with
,
I
decide
on
make
any
sacrifice
rather
than
give
the
alarm
as
soon
as
to
-
night
to
a
certain
person
who
shall
be
nameless
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
come
back
to
the
house
to
ask
you
to
take
me
to
the
north
end
of
the
beach
by
another
way

in
respect
of
its
printing
off
people
's
footstep

be
one
of
the
good
detective
officer
I
know

<EOS>
if
we
do
not
meet
with
Rosanna
Spearman
by
come
round
on
her
in
this
way
,
the
sand
may
tell
us
what
she
have
be
at
,
if
the
light
only
last
long
enough

<EOS>
here
be
the
sand

<EOS>
if
you
will
excuse
my
suggest

suppose
you
hold
your
tongue

let
me
go
first

<EOS>
if
there
be
such
a
thing
know
at
the
doctor
's
shop
as
a
DETECTIVE
-
FEVER
,
that
disease
have
now
get
fast
hold
of
your
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
go
on
between
the
hillock
of
sand
,
down
to
the
beach
.
<EOS>
I
follow
him
(
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
)
;
and
wait
at
a
little
distance
for
what
be
to
happen
next
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
turn
out
,
I
find
myself
stand
nearly
in
the
same
place
where
Rosanna
Spearman
and
I
have
be
talk
together
when
Mr.
Franklin
suddenly
appear
before
us
,
on
arrive
at
our
house
from
London
.
<EOS>
while
my
eye
be
watch
the
Sergeant
,
my
mind
wander
away
in
spite
of
me
to
what
have
pass
,
on
that
former
occasion
,
between
Rosanna
and
me
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
almost
feel
the
poor
thing
slip
her
hand
again
into
mine
,
and
give
it
a
little
grateful
squeeze
to
thank
me
for
speak
kindly
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
almost
hear
her
voice
tell
me
again
that
the
Shivering
Sand
seem
to
draw
her
to
it
against
her
own
will
<EOS>
,
whenever
she
go
out
 
almost
see
her
face
brighten
again
,
as
it
brighten
when
she
first
set
eye
upon
Mr.
Franklin
come
briskly
out
on
us
from
among
the
hillock
.
<EOS>
My
spirit
fall
lower
and
low
as
I
think
of
these
thing
 
and
the
view
of
the
lonesome
little
bay
,
when
I
look
about
to
rouse
myself
,
only
serve
to
make
me
feel
more
uneasy
still
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
of
the
evening
light
be
fade
away
;
and
over
all
the
desolate
place
there
hang
a
still
and
awful
calm
.
<EOS>
the
heave
of
the
main
ocean
on
the
great
sandbank
out
in
the
bay
,
be
a
heave
that
make
no
sound
.
<EOS>
the
inner
sea
lie
lost
and
dim
,
without
a
breath
of
wind
to
stir
it
.
<EOS>
patch
of
nasty
ooze
float
,
yellow
-
white
,
on
the
dead
surface
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
scum
and
slime
shine
faintly
in
certain
place
,
where
the
last
of
the
light
still
catch
them
on
the
two
great
spit
of
rock
jut
out
,
north
and
south
,
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
time
of
the
turn
of
the
tide
:
and
even
as
I
stand
there
wait
,
the
broad
brown
face
of
the
quicksand
begin
to
dimple
and
quiver
 
the
only
move
thing
in
all
the
horrid
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
the
Sergeant
start
as
the
shiver
of
the
sand
catch
his
eye
.
<EOS>
after
look
at
it
for
a
minute
or
so
,
he
turn
and
come
back
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
treacherous
place
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
say
;
"
and
no
sign
of
Rosanna
Spearman
anywhere
on
the
beach
,
look
where
you
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
me
down
lower
on
the
shore
,
and
I
see
for
myself
that
his
footstep
and
mine
be
the
only
footstep
print
off
on
the
sand
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
the
fishing
village
bear
,
stand
where
we
be
now
?
"
ask
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cobb
's
Hole
,
"
I
answer
(
that
be
the
name
of
the
place
)
,
"
bear
as
near
as
may
be
,
due
south
.

<EOS>
"
I
see
the
girl
this
evening
,
walk
northward
along
the
shore
,
from
Cobb
's
Hole
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
consequently
,
she
must
have
be
walk
towards
this
place
.
<EOS>
be
Cobb
's
Hole
on
the
other
side
of
that
point
of
land
there
?
<EOS>
and
can
we
get
to
it
 
<EOS>
now
it
be
low
water
 
by
the
beach
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
yes
,
"
to
both
those
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
excuse
my
suggest
it
,
we
will
step
out
briskly
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
find
the
place
where
she
leave
the
shore
,
before
it
get
dark
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
have
walk
,
I
should
say
,
a
couple
of
hundred
yard
towards
Cobb
's
Hole
,
when
Sergeant
Cuff
suddenly
go
down
on
his
knee
on
the
beach
,
to
all
appearance
seize
with
a
sudden
frenzy
for
say
his
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
to
be
say
for
your
marine
landscape
here
,
after
all
,
"
remark
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
woman
's
footstep
,
Mr.
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
let
us
call
them
Rosanna
's
footstep
,
until
we
find
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
we
can
not
resist
.
<EOS>
very
confused
footstep
,
you
will
please
to
observe
 
purposely
confused
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
ah
,
poor
soul
,
she
understand
the
detective
virtue
of
sand
as
well
as
I
do
!
<EOS>
but
have
not
she
be
in
rather
too
great
a
hurry
to
tread
out
the
mark
thoroughly
?
<EOS>
I
think
she
have
.
<EOS>
here
be
one
footstep
go
from
Cobb
's
Hole
;
and
here
be
another
go
back
to
it
.
<EOS>
be
not
that
the
toe
of
her
shoe
point
straight
to
the
water
's
edge
?
<EOS>
and
do
not
I
see
two
heel
-
mark
further
down
the
beach
,
close
at
the
water
's
edge
also
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
hurt
your
feeling
,
but
I
be
afraid
Rosanna
be
sly
.
<EOS>
It
look
as
if
she
have
determine
to
get
to
that
place
you
<EOS>
and
I
have
just
come
from
,
without
leave
any
mark
on
the
sand
to
trace
her
by
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
say
that
she
walk
through
the
water
from
this
point
till
she
get
to
that
ledge
of
rock
behind
us
,
and
come
back
the
same
way
,
and
then
take
to
the
beach
again
where
those
two
heel
mark
be
still
leave
?
<EOS>
yes
,
we
will
say
that
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
fit
in
with
my
notion
that
she
have
something
under
her
cloak
,
when
she
leave
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
not
something
to
destroy
 
for
,
in
that
case
,
where
would
have
be
the
need
of
all
these
precaution
to
prevent
my
trace
the
place
at
which
her
walk
end
?
<EOS>
something
to
hide
be
,
I
think
,
the
well
guess
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
if
we
go
on
to
the
cottage
,
we
may
find
out
what
that
something
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
proposal
,
my
detective
-
fever
suddenly
cool
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
want
me
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
what
good
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
longer
I
know
you
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
"
the
more
virtue
I
discover
.
<EOS>
modesty
 
<EOS>
oh
dear
me
<EOS>
,
how
rare
modesty
be
in
this
world
!
<EOS>
and
how
much
of
that
rarity
you
possess
!
<EOS>
if
I
go
alone
to
the
cottage
,
the
people
's
tongue
will
be
tie
at
the
first
question
I
put
to
them
.
<EOS>
if
I
go
with
you
,
I
go
introduce
by
a
justly
respect
neighbour
,
and
a
flow
of
conversation
be
the
necessary
result
.
<EOS>
It
strike
me
in
that
light
;
how
do
it
strike
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
not
have
an
answer
of
the
needful
smartness
as
ready
as
I
could
have
wish
,
I
try
to
gain
time
by
ask
him
what
cottage
he
want
to
go
to
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Sergeant
describe
the
place
,
I
recognise
it
as
a
cottage
inhabit
by
a
fisherman
name
Yolland
,
with
his
wife
and
two
grow
-
up
child
,
a
son
and
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
look
back
,
you
will
find
that
,
in
first
present
Rosanna
Spearman
to
your
notice
,
I
have
describe
her
as
occasionally
vary
her
walk
to
the
Shivering
Sand
,
by
a
visit
to
some
friend
of
her
at
Cobb
's
Hole
.
<EOS>
those
friend
be
the
Yollands
 
respectable
,
worthy
people
,
a
credit
to
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
's
acquaintance
with
them
have
begin
by
mean
of
the
daughter
,
who
be
afflict
with
a
misshapen
foot
,
and
who
be
know
in
our
part
by
the
name
of
Limping
Lucy
.
<EOS>
the
two
deform
girl
have
,
I
suppose
,
a
kind
of
fellow
-
feeling
for
each
other
.
<EOS>
anyway
,
the
Yollands
and
Rosanna
always
appear
to
get
on
together
,
at
the
few
chance
they
have
of
meeting
,
in
a
pleasant
and
friendly
manner
.
<EOS>
the
fact
of
Sergeant
Cuff
have
trace
the
girl
to
their
cottage
,
set
the
matter
of
my
help
his
inquiry
in
quite
a
new
light
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
have
merely
go
where
she
be
in
the
habit
of
go
;
and
to
show
that
she
have
be
in
company
with
the
fisherman
and
his
family
be
as
good
as
to
prove
that
she
have
be
innocently
occupy
so
far
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
do
the
girl
a
service
,
therefore
,
instead
of
an
injury
,
if
I
allow
myself
to
be
convince
by
Sergeant
Cuff
's
logic
.
<EOS>
I
profess
myself
convinced
by
it
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
on
to
Cobb
's
Hole
,
see
the
footstep
on
the
sand
,
as
long
as
the
light
last
.
  
<EOS>
on
reach
the
cottage
,
the
fisherman
and
his
son
prove
to
be
out
in
the
boat
;
and
Limping
Lucy
,
always
weak
and
weary
,
be
rest
on
her
bed
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
good
Mrs.
Yolland
receive
us
alone
in
her
kitchen
.
<EOS>
when
she
hear
that
Sergeant
Cuff
be
a
celebrated
character
in
London
,
she
clap
a
bottle
of
dutch
gin
and
a
couple
of
clean
pipe
on
the
table
,
and
stare
as
if
she
could
never
see
enough
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
sit
quiet
in
a
corner
,
wait
to
hear
how
the
Sergeant
would
find
his
way
to
the
subject
of
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
His
usual
roundabout
manner
of
go
to
work
prove
,
on
this
occasion
,
to
be
more
roundabout
than
ever
.
<EOS>
how
he
manage
it
be
more
than
I
could
tell
at
the
time
,
and
more
than
I
can
tell
now
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
certain
,
he
begin
with
the
Royal
Family
,
the
Primitive
Methodists
,
and
the
price
of
fish
;
and
he
get
from
that
(
in
his
dismal
,
underground
way
)
to
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone

the
spitefulness
of
our
first
house

maid

the
hard
behaviour
of
the
woman
-
servant
generally
towards
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
have
reach
his
subject
in
this
fashion
,
he
describe
himself
as
make
his
inquiry
about
the
lose
Diamond
,
partly
with
a
view
to
find
it
,
and
partly
for
the
purpose
of
clear
Rosanna
from
the
unjust
suspicion
of
her
enemy
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
the
time
when
we
enter
the
kitchen
,
good
Mrs.
Yolland
be
persuade
that
she
be
talk
to
Rosanna
's
good
friend
,
and
be
press
Sergeant
Cuff
to
comfort
his
stomach
and
revive
his
spirit
out
of
the
dutch
bottle
.
  
<EOS>
be
firmly
persuade
that
the
Sergeant
be
waste
his
breath
to
no
purpose
on
Mrs.
Yolland
,
I
sit
enjoy
the
talk
between
them
,
much
as
I
have
sit
,
in
my
time
,
enjoy
a
stage
play
.
<EOS>
the
great
Cuff
show
a
wonderful
patience
;
try
his
luck
drearily
this
way
and
that
way
,
and
firing
shot
after
shot
,
as
it
be
,
at
random
,
on
the
chance
of
hit
the
mark
.
<EOS>
everything
to
Rosanna
's
credit
,
nothing
to
Rosanna
's
prejudice
 
<EOS>
that
be
how
it
end
,
try
as
he
may
;
with
Mrs.
Yolland
talk
nineteen
to
the
dozen
,
and
place
the
most
entire
confidence
in
him
.
<EOS>
His
last
effort
be
make
,
when
we
have
look
at
our
watch
,
and
have
get
on
our
leg
previous
to
take
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
now
wish
you
good

night
,
madam

"
say
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
shall
only
say
,
at
parting
,
that
Rosanna
Spearman
have
a
sincere
well
-
wisher
in
myself
,
your
obedient
servant
.
<EOS>
but
,
oh
dear
me
!
<EOS>
she
will
never
get
on
in
her
present
place
;
and
my
advice
to
her
be
 
<EOS>
leave
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
bless
your
heart
alive

<EOS>

be
go

Mrs.
Yolland

<EOS>
(
NOTA
BENE
 
<EOS>
I
translate
Mrs.
Yolland
out
of
the
Yorkshire
language
into
the
english
language
.
<EOS>
when
I
tell
you
that
the
all
-
accomplished
Cuff
be
every
now
and
then
puzzle
to
understand
her
until
I
help
him
,
you
will
draw
your
own
conclusion
as
to
what
your
state
of
mind
would
be
if
I
report
her
in
her
native
tongue
.
)
  
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
go
to
leave
us
!
<EOS>
I
prick
up
my
ear
at
that
.
<EOS>
It
seem
strange
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
,
that
she
should
have
give
no
warning
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
my
lady
or
to
me
.
<EOS>
a
certain
doubt
come
up
in
my
mind
whether
Sergeant
Cuff
's
last
random
shot
may
not
have
hit
the
mark
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
question
whether
my
share
in
the
proceeding
be
quite
as
harmless
a
one
as
I
have
think
it
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
all
in
the
way
of
the
Sergeant
's
business
to
mystify
an
honest
woman
by
wrap
her
round
in
a
network
of
lie
but
it
be
my
duty
to
have
remember
,
as
a
good
Protestant
,
that
the
father
of
lie
be
the
Devil
 
and
<EOS>
that
mischief
and
the
Devil
be
never
far
apart
.
<EOS>
begin
to
smell
mischief
in
the
air
,
I
try
to
take
Sergeant
Cuff
out
.
<EOS>
He
sit
down
again
instantly
,
and
ask
for
a
little
drop
of
comfort
out
of
the
dutch
bottle
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Yolland
sit
down
opposite
to
him
,
and
give
him
his
nip
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
to
the
door
,
excessively
uncomfortable
,
and
say
I
think
I
must
bid
them
good
-
night
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
do
not
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
she
mean
to
leave
?
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
she
to
do
when
she
do
leave
?
<EOS>
sad
,
sad
!
<EOS>
the
poor
creature
have
get
no
friend
in
the
world

you

<EOS>

<EOS>
"

Mrs.

She

I

this
evening

little
with
my
girl
Lucy
and
me
she
ask
to
go
up

stair
by
herself
,
into
Lucy
's
room

<EOS>
It

there

"
I
want
to
write
a
letter
to
a
friend
,

she

"
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
do
it

the
prying
and
peeping
of
the

up
at

who
the

I
offer

a

She
have
not

the
letter

she
do
not
accept

little
close
,
poor
soul

about

the
Sergeant

as
soon

Mrs.
Yolland
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
step
in
again
from
the
door
.
<EOS>
as
chief
of
my
lady
's
establishment
,
I
could
not
allow
this
sort
of
loose
talk

not

if
one
or
both
of
them
have
mortally
offend
me
.
<EOS>
before
I
have
take
three
step
down
the
village
,
I
hear
the
Sergeant
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
for
your
introduction
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
indebted
to
the
fisherman
's
wife
for
an
entirely
new
sensation
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Yolland
have
puzzle
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
have
give
him
a
sharp
answer
,
for
no
well
reason
than
this
 
that
I
be
out
of
temper
with
him
,
because
I
be
out
of
temper
with
myself
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
own
to
be
puzzle
,
a
comfort
doubt
cross
my
mind
whether
any
great
harm
have
be
do
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
wait
in
discreet
silence
to
hear
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
as
if
he
be
actually
read
my
thought
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
instead
of
put
me
on
the
scent
,
it
may
console
you
to
know
,
Mr.
Betteredge
(
with
your
interest
in
Rosanna
)
,
that
you
have
be
the
mean
of
throw
me
off
.
<EOS>
what
the
girl
have
do
,
to
-
night
,
be
clear
enough
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
She
have
join
the
two
chain
,
and
have
fasten
them
to
the
hasp
in
the
tin
case
.
<EOS>
She
have
sink
the
case
,
in
the
water
or
in
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
She
have
make
the
loose
end
of
the
chain
fast
to
some
place
under
the
rock
,
know
only
to
herself
.
<EOS>
and
she
will
leave
the
case
secure
at
its
anchorage
till
the
present
proceeding
have
come
to
an
end
;
after
which
she
can
privately
pull
it
up
again
out
of
its
hiding
-
place
,
at
her
own
leisure
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
all
perfectly
plain
,
so
far
.
<EOS>
but
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
with
the
first
tone
of
impatience
in
his
voice
that
I
have
hear
yet
,
"
the
mystery
be
 
what
the
devil
have
she
hide
in
the
tin
case
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
to
myself
,
"
the
Moonstone
!
"
<EOS>
but
I
only
say
to
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
can
not
you
guess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
the
Diamond
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
the
whole
experience
of
my
life
be
at
fault
,
if
Rosanna
Spearman
have
get
the
Diamond

"
  
<EOS>
on
hear
those
word
,
the
infernal
detective
-
fever
begin
,
I
suppose
,
to
burn
in
me
again
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
I
forget
myself
in
the
interest
of
guess
this
new
riddle
.
<EOS>
I
say
rashly
,
"
the
stained
dress
!
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
stop
short
in
the
dark
,
and
lay
his
hand
on
my
arm

<EOS>
"
be
anything

into

up

never

I

She
know
it
as
well

<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
"
what
on
earth
have
she
get
to
do
but
to
tie
up
a
bit
of
stone
in
the
stained
dress

throw
it
into
the
quicksand
?
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
shadow
of
a
reason
why
she
should
have
hide
it
 
<EOS>
and
yet
she
must
have
hide
it

Query
,
"

on
again

the
paint

stain
dress

gown

be
it
something
else

there
be
a
reason
for
preserve
at
any
risk

<EOS>
Mr.
Betteredge
,
if
nothing
occur
to
prevent
it
,
I
must
go
to
Frizinghall
to

morrow
,

discover
what
she
buy
in
the
town
,
when
she
privately
get
the
material
for

the
substitute
dress
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
risk
to
leave
the
house
,
as
thing
be
now
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
bad
risk
still
to
stir
another
step
in
this
matter
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
excuse
my
be
a
little
out
of
temper
<EOS>
;
I
be
degrade
in
my

I
have
let
Rosanna

puzzle
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
we
get
back
,
the
servant
be
at
supper
.
<EOS>
the
first
person
we
see
in
the
outer
yard
be
the
policeman
whom
Superintendent
Seegrave
have
leave
at
the
Sergeant

disposal

<EOS>
the
Sergeant
ask
if
Rosanna

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
when

<EOS>
nearly
an
hour
since

what
have

She

stair
to
take
off

now
at

quietly
with

<EOS>
without
make
any
remark
,
Sergeant
Cuff
walk
on
,
sink
low
and
low
in
his
own
estimation
,
to
the
back
of
the
house

<EOS>
miss
the
entrance
in
the
dark
,
he
go
on
(
in
spite
of
my
calling
to
him
)
till
he
be
stop
by
a
wicket
-
gate
which
lead
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
when
I
join
him
to
bring
him
back
by
the
right
way
,
I
find
that
he
be
look
up
attentively
at
one
particular
window
,
on
the
bed
-
room
floor
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
look
up
,
in
my
turn
,
I
discover
that
the
object
of
his
contemplation
be
the
window
of
Miss
Rachel
's
room
,
and
that
light
be
pass
backwards
and
forwards
there
as
if
something
unusual
be
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
that
Miss
Verinder
's
room

"
ask
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
I
reply
that
it
be
,
and
invite
him
to
go
in
with
me
to
supper
.
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
remain
in
his
place
,
and
say
something
about
enjoy
the
smell
of
the
garden
at
night
.
<EOS>
I
leave
him
to
his
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
be
turn
in
at
the
door
,
I
hear
"
<EOS>
the
last
Rose
of
Summer

at
the
wicket

gate

<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
have
make
another
discovery
!
<EOS>
and
my
young
lady
's
window
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
this
time
!
  
<EOS>
the
latter
reflection
take
me
back
again
to
the
Sergeant
,
with
a
polite
intimation
that
I
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
leave
him
by
himself
.
<EOS>
"
be
there
anything
you
do
not
understand
up
there
?
"
<EOS>
I
add
,
point
to
Miss
Rachel
's
window
.
  
<EOS>
judge
by
his
voice
,
Sergeant
Cuff
have
suddenly
rise
again
to
the
right
place
in
his
own
estimation
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
great
people
for
bet
in
Yorkshire
,
be
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
suppose
we
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
a
Yorkshireman
,
"
proceed
the
Sergeant
,
take
my
arm
,
"
I
would
lay
you
an
even
sovereign
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
that
your
young
lady
have
suddenly
resolve
to
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
if
I
win
on
that
event
,
I
should
offer
to
lay
another
sovereign
,
that
the
idea
have
occur
to
her
within
the
last
hour
.
<EOS>
"
the
first
of
the
Sergeant
's
guess
startle
me
.
<EOS>
the
second
mix
itself
up
somehow
in
my
head
with
the
report
we
have
hear
from
the
policeman
,
that
Rosanna
Spearman
have
return
from
the
sand
with
in
the
last
hour
.
<EOS>
the
two
together
have
a
curious
effect
on
me
as
we
go
in
to
supper
.
<EOS>
I
shake
off
Sergeant
Cuff
's
arm
,
and
,
forget
my
manner
,
push
by
him
through
the
door
to
make
my
own
inquiry
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Samuel
,
the
footman
,
be
the
first
person
I
meet
in
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
ladyship
be
wait
to
see
you
and
Sergeant
Cuff
,

he
say
,
before
I
could
put
any
question
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
long
have

"
<EOS>
ask
the
Sergeant

voice
behind
me

<EOS>
there

resolution
out
of
the
common

and
my
lady
have
be
wait
to
see
the
Sergeant
 
all
within
the
last
hour
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
pleasant
to
find
these
very
different
person
and
thing
link
themselves
together
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
upstairs
,
without
look
at
Sergeant
Cuff
,
or
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
My
hand
take
a
sudden
fit
of
tremble

I
lift
it
to
knock
at

door

as

the
word
I
hear
my

voice
call
to
us
to
come
in

instead

close

make
a
step
forward

go
clean
out

collar

him
against

My

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
go
into

house
to
get
a
light
to
read
it
by
,
Samuel
remark
that
there
seem
a
change
come
in
the
weather

<EOS>
My
troubled
mind
have
prevent
me
from
notice
it

<EOS>
but
,
now
my
attention
be
rouse
,
I
hear
the
dog
uneasy
,
and
the
wind
moan
low
.
<EOS>
look
up
at
the
sky
,
I
see
the
rack
of
cloud
get
blacker
and
blacker
,
and
hurry
faster
and
faster
over
a
watery
moon
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
Samuel

right
,
wild

me
,
that
the
magistrate
at
Frizinghall
have
write
to
remind
her
about
the
three
Indians

<EOS>
early
in
the
come
week
,
the
rogue
must
need
be
release
,
and
leave
free
to
follow
their
own
device

<EOS>
if
we
have
any
more
question
to
ask
them
,
there
be
no
time
to
lose
.
<EOS>
have
forget
to
mention
this
,
when
she
have
last
see
Sergeant
Cuff
,
my
mistress
now
desire
me
to
supply
the
omission
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
have
go
clean
out
of
my
head
(
as
they
have
,
no
doubt
,
go
clean
out
of
yours
)
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
much
use
in
stir
that
subject
again
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
obey
my
order
on
the
spot
,
as
a
matter
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
Sergeant
Cuff
and
the
gardener
,
with
a
bottle
of
Scotch
whisky
between
them
,
head
over
ear
in
an
argument
on
the
growing
of
rose
.
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
be
so
deeply
interested
that
he
hold
up
his
hand
,
and
sign
to
me
not
to
interrupt
the
discussion
,
when
I
come
in
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
could
understand
it
,
the
question
between
them
be
,
whether
the
white
moss
rise
do
,
or
do
not
,
require
to
be
bud
on
the
dog
-
rise
to
make
it
grow
well
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Begbie
say
,
yes
;
and
Sergeant
Cuff
say
,
no
.
<EOS>
They
appeal
to
me
,
as
hotly
as
a
couple
of
boy
.
<EOS>
know
nothing
whatever
about
the
growing
of
rose
,
I
steer
a
middle
course
 
just
as
her
Majesty
's
judge
do
,
when
the
scale
of
justice
bother
them
by
hang
even
to
a
hair
.
<EOS>
"
gentleman
,
"
I
remark
,
"
there
be
much
to
be
say
on
both
side
.
"
<EOS>
in
the
temporary
lull
produce
by
that
impartial
sentence
,
I
lay
my
lady
's
write
message
on
the
table
,
under
the
eye
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
get
by
this
time
,
as
nearly
as
may
be
,
to
hate
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
but
truth
compel
me
to
acknowledge
that
,
in
respect
of
readiness
of
mind
,
he
be
a
wonderful
man
.
  
<EOS>
in
half
a
minute
after
he
have
read
the
message
,
he
have
look
back
into
his
memory
for
Superintendent
Seegrave
's
report
;
have
pick
out
that
part
of
it
in
which
the
Indians
be
concern
;
and
be
ready
with
his
answer
.
<EOS>
a
certain
great
traveller
,
who
understand
the
Indians
and
their
language
,
have
figure
in
Mr.
Seegrave
's
report
,
have
not
he
?
<EOS>
very
well
.
<EOS>
do
I
know
the
gentleman
's
name
and
address
?
<EOS>
very
well
again
.
<EOS>
Would
I
write
them
on
the
back
of
my
lady
's
message
?
<EOS>
much
oblige
to
me
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
would
look
that
gentleman
up
,
when
he
go
to
Frizinghall
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
expect
anything
to
come
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
"
<EOS>
Superintendent
Seegrave
find
the
Indians
as
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Superintendent
Seegrave
have
be
prove
wrong
,
up
to
this
time
,
in
all
his
conclusion
,
"
answer
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
worth
while
to
find
out
to
-
morrow
whether
Superintendent
Seegrave
be
wrong
about
the
Indians
as
well
.
"
<EOS>
with
that
he
turn
to
Mr.
Begbie
,
and
take
up
the
argument
again
exactly
at
the
place
where
it
have
leave
off
.
"
<EOS>
this
question
between
us
be
a
question
of
soil
and
season
,
and
patience
and
pain
,
Mr.
Gardener
.
<EOS>
now
let
me
put
it
to
you
from
another
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
You
take
your
white
mos
<EOS>
rise
 
"
  
<EOS>
by
that
time
,
I
have
close
the
door
on
them
,
and
be
out
of
hearing
of
the
rest
of
the
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
passage
,
I
meet
Penelope
hang
about
,
and
ask
what
she
be
wait
for
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
wait
for
her
young
lady
's
bell
,
when
her
young
lady
choose
to
call
her
back
to
go
on
with
the
packing
for
the
next
day
's
journey
.
<EOS>
further
inquiry
reveal
to
me
,
that
Miss
Rachel
have
give
it
as
a
reason
for
want
to
go
to
her
aunt
at
Frizinghall
,
that
the
house
be
unendurable
to
her
,
and
that
she
could
bear
the
odious
presence
of
a
policeman
under
the
same
roof
with
herself
no
longer
.
<EOS>
on
be
inform
,
half
an
hour
since
,
that
her
departure
would
be
delay
till
two
in
the
afternoon
,
she
have
fly
into
a
violent
passion
.
<EOS>
My
lady
,
present
at
the
time
,
have
severely
rebuke
her
,
and
then
(
have
apparently
something
to
say
,
which
be
reserve
for
her
daughter
's
private
ear
)
have
send
Penelope
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
My
girl
be
in
wretchedly
low
spirit
about
the
changed
state
of
thing
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
go
right
,
father
;
nothing
be
like
what
it
use
to
be

I
feel
as
if
some
dreadful
misfortune
be
hang
over
us
all

"
  
<EOS>
that
be
my
feeling
too
.
<EOS>
but
I
put
a
good
face
on
it
,
before
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
's
bell
rang
while
we
be
talk
.
<EOS>
Penelope
run
up
the
back
stair
to
go
on
with
the
packing
.
<EOS>
I
go
by
the
other
way
to
the
hall
,
to
see
what
the
glass
say
about
the
change
in
the
weather
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
I
approach
the
swing
-
door
lead
into
the
hall
from
the
servant
'
office
,
it
be
violently
open
from
the
other
side
,
and
Rosanna
Spearman
run
by
me
,
with
a
miserable
look
of
pain
in
her
face
,
and
one
of
her
hand
press
hard
over
her
heart
,
as
if
the
pang
be
in
that
quarter
.

what
be
the
matter
,
my

?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
stop
her
.
"
<EOS>
be
you
ill
?
"
<EOS>
"
for
God
's
sake
,
do
not
speak
to
me

"
she
answer
,
and
twist
herself
out
of
my
hand
,
and
run
on
towards
the
servant
'
staircase
.
<EOS>
I
call
to
the
cook
(
who
be
within
hearing
)
to
look
after
the
poor
girl
.
<EOS>
two
other
person
prove
to
be
within
hearing
,
as
well
as
the
cook
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
dart
softly
out
of
my
room
,
and
ask
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
,
on
the
other
side
,
pull
open
the
swing
-
door
,
and
beckon
me
into
the
hall
,
inquire
if
I
have
see
anything
of
Rosanna
Spearman
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
just
pass
me
,
sir
,
with
a
very
disturbed
face
,
and
in
a
very
odd
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
I
be
innocently
the
cause
of
that
disturbance

Betteredge

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
sir
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
explain
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
;
"
but
,
if
the
girl
be
concern
in
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
,
I
do
really
believe
she
be
on
the
point
of
confess
everything
 
to
me
,
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
 
not
two
minute
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
look
towards
the
swing
-
door
,
as
he
say
those
last
word
,
I
fancy
I
see
it
open
a
little
way
from
the
inner
side
.
  
<EOS>
be
there
anybody
listen
?
<EOS>
the
door
fall
to
,
before
I
could
get
to
it
.
<EOS>
look
through
,
the
moment
after
,
I
think
I
see
the
tail
of
Sergeant
Cuff
's
respectable
black
coat
disappear
round
the
corner
of
the
passage
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
he
could
expect
no
more
help
from
me
,
now
that
I
have
discover
the
turn
which
his
investigation
be
really
take
.
<EOS>
under
those
circumstance
,
it
be
quite
in
his
character
to
help
himself
,
and
to
do
it
by
the
underground
way
.
  
<EOS>
not
feel
sure
that
I
have
really
see
the
Sergeant
 
and
not
desire
to
make
needless
mischief
,
<EOS>
where
,
Heaven
know
,
there
be
mischief
enough
go
on
already
 
<EOS>
I
tell
Mr.
Franklin
that
I
think
one
of
the
dog
have
get
into
the
house
 
and
then
beg
him
to
describe
what
have
happen
between
Rosanna
and
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
pass
through
the
hall
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
meet
her
accidentally
,
when
she
speak
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
point
to
the
billiard
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
knock
the
ball
about
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
try
to
get
this
miserable
business
of
the
Diamond
out
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
happen
to
look
up
 
and
there
stand
Rosanna
Spearman
at
the
side
of
me
,
like
a
ghost
!
<EOS>
Her
steal
on
me
in
that
way
be
so
strange
,
that
I
hardly
know
what
to
do
at
first
.
<EOS>
see
a
very
anxious
expression
in
her
face
,
I
ask
her
if
she
wish
to
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
answer
,
"
yes
,
if
I
dare
.
"
<EOS>
know
what
suspicion
attach
to
her
,
I
could
only
put
one
construction
on
such
language
as
that
.
<EOS>
I
confess
it
make
me
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
wish
to
invite
the
girl
's
confidence
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
in
the
difficulty
that
now
beset
us
,
I
could
hardly
feel
justified
in
refuse
to
listen
to
her
,
if
she
be
really
bent
on
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
awkward
position
;
and
I
dare
say
I
get
out
of
it
awkwardly
enough
.
<EOS>
I
say
to
her
,
"
I
do
not
quite
understand
you
.
<EOS>
be
there
anything
you
want
me
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
mind
,
Betteredge
,
I
do
not
speak
unkindly
!
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
can
not
help
be
ugly
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
,
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
the
cue
be
still
in
my
hand
,
and
I
go
on
knock
the
ball
about
,
to
take
off
the
awkwardness
of
the
thing
.
<EOS>
as
it
turn
out
,
I
only
make
matter
bad
still
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
mortify
her
without
mean
it
!
<EOS>
She
suddenly
turn
away
.
"
<EOS>
He
look
at
the
billiard
ball
,
"
I
hear
her
say
.
<EOS>
"
anything
rather
than
look
at
_
me
_
!
<EOS>
"
before
I
could
stop
her
,
she
have
leave
the
hall
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
quite
easy
about
it
,
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
Would
you
mind
tell
Rosanna
that
I
mean
no
unkindness
?
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
little
hard
on
her
,
perhaps
,
in
my
own
thought
 
<EOS>
I
have
almost
hope
that
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
may
be
trace
to
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
not
from
any
ill
-
will
to
the
poor
girl
:
but
 
"
He
stop
there
,
and
go
back
to
the
billiard
-
table
,
begin
to
knock
the
ball
about
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
after
what
have
pass
between
the
Sergeant
and
me
,
I
know
what
it
be
that
he
have
leave
unspoken
as
well
as
he
know
it
himself
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
tracing
of
the
Moonstone
to
our
second
housemaid
could
now
raise
Miss
Rachel
above
the
infamous
suspicion
that
rest
on
her
in
the
mind
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
longer
a
question
of
quiet
my
young
lady
's
nervous
excitement
;
it
be
a
question
of
prove
her
innocence
.
<EOS>
if
Rosanna
have
do
nothing
to
compromise
herself
,
the
hope
which
Mr.
Franklin
confess
to
have
feel
would
have
be
hard
enough
on
her
in
all
conscience
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
She
have
pretend
to
be
ill
,
and
have
go
secretly
to
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
up
all
night
,
make
something
or
destroy
something
,
in
private
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
be
at
the
Shivering
Sand
,
that
evening
,
under
circumstance
which
be
highly
suspicious
,
to
say
the
least
of
them
.
<EOS>
for
all
these
reason
(
sorry
as
I
be
for
Rosanna
)
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
think
that
Mr.
Franklin
's
way
of
look
at
the
matter
be
neither
unnatural
nor
unreasonable
,
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
position
.
<EOS>
I
say
a
word
to
him
to
that
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
in
return
.
"
<EOS>
but
there
be
just
a
chance
 
a
very
poor
one
,
certainly
 
that
Rosanna
's
conduct
may
admit
of
some
explanation
which
we
do
not
see
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
hate
hurt
a
woman
's
feeling
,
Betteredge
!
<EOS>
tell
the
poor
creature
what
I
tell
you
to
tell
her
.
<EOS>
and
if
she
want
to
speak
to
me
 
I
do
not
care
whether
I
get
into
a
scrape
or
not
 
<EOS>
send
her
to
me
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
"
with
those
kind
word
he
lay
down
the
cue
and
leave
me
.
  
<EOS>
inquiry
at
the
servant
'
office
inform
me
that
Rosanna
have
retire
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
She
have
decline
all
offer
of
assistance
with
thank
,
and
have
only
ask
to
be
leave
to
rest
in
quiet
.
<EOS>
here
,
therefore
,
be
an
end
of
any
confession
on
her
part
(
supposing
she
really
have
a
confession
to
make
)
for
that
night
.
<EOS>
I
report
the
result
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
who
,
thereupon
,
leave
the
library
,
and
go
up
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
put
the
light
out
,
and
make
the
window
fast
,
when
Samuel
come
in
with
news
of
the
two
guest
whom
I
have
leave
in
my
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
argument
about
the
white
moss
rise
<EOS>
have
apparently
come
to
an
end
at
last
.
<EOS>
the
gardener
have
go
home
,
and
Sergeant
Cuff
be
nowhere
to
be
find
in
the
low
region
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
into
my
room
.
<EOS>
quite
true
 
nothing
be
to
be
discover
there
but
a
couple
of
empty
tumbler
and
a
strong
smell
of
hot
grog
.
<EOS>
have
the
Sergeant
go
of
his
own
accord
to
the
bed
-
chamber
that
be
prepare
for
him
?
<EOS>
I
go
up
-
stair
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
after
reach
the
second
landing
,
I
think
I
hear
a
sound
of
quiet
and
regular
breathing
on
my
left
-
hand
side
.
<EOS>
My
left
-
hand
side
lead
to
the
corridor
which
communicate
with
Miss
Rachel
's
room
.
<EOS>
I
look
in
,
and
there
,
coil
up
on
three
chair
place
right
across
the
passage
 
there
,
with
a
red
handkerchief
tie
round
his
grizzle
head
,
and
his
respectable
black
coat
roll
up
for
a
pillow
,
lay
and
sleep
Sergeant
Cuff
!
  
<EOS>
He
wake
,
instantly
and
quietly
,
like
a
dog
,
the
moment
I
approach
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
night
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
mind
,
if
you
ever
take
to
grow
rose
,
the
white
moss
rise
be
all
the
well
for
not
be
bud
on
the
dog
-
rose
,
whatever
the
gardener
may
say
to
the
contrary
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
do
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
why
be
you
not
in
your
proper
bed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
in
my
proper
bed
,
"
answer
the
Sergeant
,
"
because
I
be
one
of
the
many
people
in
this
miserable
world
who
can
not
earn
their
money
honestly
and
easily
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
coincidence
,
this
evening
,
between
the
period
of
Rosanna
Spearman
's
return
from
the
Sands
and
the
period
when
Miss
Verinder
state
her
resolution
to
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
whatever
Rosanna
may
have
hide
,
it
be
clear
to
my
mind
that
your
young
lady
could
not
go
away
until
she
know
that
it
be
hide
.
<EOS>
the
two
must
have
communicate
privately
once
already
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
if
they
try
to
communicate
again
,
when
the
house
be
quiet
,
I
want
to
be
in
the
way
,
and
stop
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
blame
me
for
upset
your
sleep
arrangement
,
Mr.
Betteredge
 
blame
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
God
the
Diamond
have
never
find
its
way
into
this
house
!
<EOS>
"
I
break
out
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
look
with
a
rueful
face
at
the
three
chair
on
which
he
have
condemn
himself
to
pass
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
do
I
,
"
he
say
,
gravely
.
    
<EOS>
nothing
happen
in
the
night
;
and
(
I
be
happy
to
add
)
<EOS>
no
attempt
at
communication
between
Miss
Rachel
and
Rosanna
reward
the
vigilance
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
expect
the
Sergeant
to
set
off
for
Frizinghall
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
He
wait
about
,
however
,
as
if
he
have
something
else
to
do
first
.
<EOS>
I
leave
him
to
his
own
device
;
and
go
into
the
ground
shortly
after
,
meet
Mr.
Franklin
on
his
favourite
walk
by
the
shrubbery
side
.
  
<EOS>
before
we
have
exchange
two
word
,
the
Sergeant
unexpectedly
join
us
.
<EOS>
He
make
up
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
who
receive
him
,
I
must
own
,
haughtily
enough

you
anything

be
all
the
return
he
get
for
politely
wish
Mr.
Franklin
good
morning

"
I
have
something

answer
the
Sergeant
,

on
the
subject

here
.
<EOS>
You
detect
the
turn
that
inquiry
be
really
take
,
yesterday
.
<EOS>
naturally
enough
,
in
your
position
,
you
be
shocked
and
distressed
.
<EOS>
naturally
enough
,
also
,
you
visit
your
own
angry
sense
of
your
own
family
scandal
upon
Me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want

"
<EOS>
Mr.

break
in
,
sharply
enough
.

I
want
to

that

thus
far

bear
that

be
pleased
to

,
at

time
,
that
I
be
an
officer
of

here
under

sanction
of
the
mistress
of
the
house

under

it
not

your

<EOS>
"
I
possess
no
special
information

say
Mr.
Franklin

Sergeant
Cuff
put
that
answer
by
him

Mr.

<EOS>
"
one
of
the
female
servant

I
will
not
mention

last
night
.

"
  
<EOS>
once
more
Mr.
Franklin
cut
him
short
;
once
more
Mr.
Franklin
answer
,
"
I
have
nothing

"
  
<EOS>
stand
by
in
silence
,
I
think
of
the
movement
in
the
swing
-
door
on
the
previous
evening
,
and
of
the
coat
-
tail
which
I
have
see
disappear
down
the
passage
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
have
,
no
doubt
,
just
hear
enough
,
before
I
interrupt
him
,
to
make
him
suspect
that
Rosanna
have
relieve
her
mind
by
confess
something
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
this
notion
have
barely
strike
me
 
when
who
should
appear
at
the
end
of
the
shrubbery
walk
but
Rosanna
Spearman
in
her
own
proper
person
!
<EOS>
She
be
follow
by
Penelope
,
who
be
evidently
try
to
make
her
retrace
her
step
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
see
that
Mr.
Franklin
be
not
alone
,
Rosanna
come
to
a
standstill
,
evidently
in
great
perplexity
what
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
Penelope
wait
behind
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
see
the
girl
as
soon
as
I
see
them
.
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
,
with
his
devilish
cunning
,
take
on
not
to
have
notice
them
at
all
.
<EOS>
all
this
happen
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
before
either
Mr.
Franklin
or
I
could
say
a
word
,
Sergeant
Cuff
strike
in
smoothly
,
with
an
appearance
of
continue
the
previous
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
be
afraid
of
harm
the
girl
,
sir
,
"
he
say
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
speak
in
a
loud
voice
,
so
that
Rosanna
may
hear
him
.
"
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
recommend
you
to
honour
me
with
your
confidence
,
if
you
feel
any
interest
in
Rosanna
Spearman
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
instantly
take
on
not
to
have
notice
the
girl
either
.
<EOS>
He
answer
,
speak
loudly
on
his
side
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
no
interest
<EOS>
whatever
in
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
look
towards
the
end
of
the
walk
.
<EOS>
all
I
see
at
the
distance
be
that
Rosanna
suddenly
turn
round
,
the
moment
Mr.
Franklin
have
speak
.
<EOS>
instead
of
resist
Penelope
,
as
she
have
do
the
moment
before
,
she
now
let
my
daughter
take
her
by
the
arm
and
lead
her
back
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
breakfast
-
bell
rang
as
the
two
girl
disappear
 
and
even
Sergeant
Cuff
be
now
oblige
to
give
it
up
as
a
bad
job
!

He
say
to
me
quietly
,
"
I
shall
go
to
Frizinghall
,
Mr.
Betteredge
;
and
I
shall
be
back
before
two
.
"
<EOS>
He
go
his
way
without
a
word
more
 
and
for
some
few
hour
we
be
well
rid
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
make
it
right
with
Rosanna
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
say
to
me
,
when
we
be
alone
.
<EOS>
"
I
seem
to
be
fate
to
say
or
do
something
awkward
,
before
that
unlucky
girl
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
see
yourself
that
Sergeant
Cuff
lay
a
trap
for
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
confuse
me
,
or
irritate
HER
into
break
out
,
either
she
or
I
may
have
say
something
which
would
answer
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
I
see
no
well
way
out
of
it
than
the
way
I
take
.
<EOS>
It
stop
the
girl
from
say
anything
,
and
it
show
the
Sergeant
that
I
see
through
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
listen
,
Betteredge
,
when
I
be
speak
to
you
last
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
do
bad
than
listen
,
as
I
privately
think
to
myself
.
<EOS>
He
have
remember
my
tell
him
that
the
girl
be
in
love
with
Mr.
Franklin
;
and
he
have
calculate
on
that
,
when
he
appeal
to
Mr.
Franklin
's
interest
in
Rosanna
 
in
Rosanna
's
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
listening
,
sir
,
"
I
remark
(
keep
the
other
point
to
myself
)
,
"
we
shall
all
be
row
in
the
same
boat
if
this
sort
of
thing
go
on
much
long
.
<EOS>
pry
,
and
peeping
,
and
listening
be
the
natural
occupation
of
people
situate
as
we
be
.
<EOS>
in
another
day
or
two
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
we
shall
all
be
strike
dumb
together
 
for
this
reason
,
that
we
shall
all
be
listen
to
surprise
each
other
's
secret
,
and
all
know
it
.
<EOS>
excuse
my
breaking
out
,
sir
.
<EOS>
the
horrid
mystery
hang
over
us
in
this
house
get
into
my
head
like
liquor
,
and
make
me
wild
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
forget
what
you
have
tell
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
the
first
opportunity
of
make
it
right
with
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
say
anything
to
her
yet
about
last
night
,
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
say
nothing
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
well
not
invite
the
girl
's
confidence
,
with
the
Sergeant
on
the
look
-
out
to
surprise
us
together
.
<EOS>
My
conduct
be
not
very
consistent
<EOS>
,
Betteredge
 
be
it
?
<EOS>
I
see
no
way
out
of
this
business
,
which
be
not
dreadful
to
think
of
,
unless
the
Diamond
be
trace
to
Rosanna
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
can
not
,
and
will
not
,
help
Sergeant
Cuff
to
find
the
girl
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
unreasonable
enough
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
my
state
of
mind
as
well
.
<EOS>
I
thoroughly
understand
him
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
,
for
once
in
your
life
,
remember
that
you
be
mortal
,
perhaps
you
will
thoroughly
understand
him
too
.
  
<EOS>
the
state
of
thing
,
indoor
and
out
,
while
Sergeant
Cuff
be
on
his
way
to
Frizinghall
,
be
briefly
this
:
  
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
wait
for
the
time
when
the
carriage
be
to
take
her
to
her
aunt
's
,
still
obstinately
shut
up
in
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
My
lady
and
Mr.
Franklin
breakfast
together
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
Mr.
Franklin
take
one
of
his
sudden
resolution
,
and
go
out
precipitately
to
quiet
his
mind
by
a
long
walk
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
only
person
who
see
him
go
;
and
he
tell
me
he
should
be
back
before
the
Sergeant
return
.
<EOS>
the
change
in
the
weather
,
foreshadow
overnight
,
have
come
.
<EOS>
heavy
rain
have
be
follow
soon
after
dawn
,
by
high
wind
.
<EOS>
It
be
blow
fresh
,
as
the
day
get
on
.
<EOS>
but
though
the
cloud
threaten
more
than
once
,
the
rain
still
hold
off
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
bad
day
for
a
walk
,
if
you
be
young
and
strong
,
and
could
breast
the
great
gust
of
wind
which
come
sweep
in
from
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
I
attend
my
lady
after
breakfast
,
and
assist
her
in
the
settlement
of
our
household
account
.
<EOS>
She
only
once
allude
to
the
matter
of
the
Moonstone
,
and
that
be
in
the
way
of
forbid
any
present
mention
of
it
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
wait
till
that
man
come
back
,
"
she
say
,
mean
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
We
MUST
speak
of
it
then
:
we
be
not
oblige
to
speak
of
it
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
leave
my
mistress
,
I
find
Penelope
wait
for
me
in
my
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
father
,
you
would
come
and
speak
to
Rosanna
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
uneasy
about
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
suspect
what
be
the
matter
readily
enough
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
maxim
of
mine
that
man
(
be
superior
creature
)
be
bind
to
improve
woman
 
if
they
can
.
<EOS>
when
a
woman
want
me
to
do
anything
(
my
daughter
,
or
not
,
it
do
not
matter
)
,
I
always
insist
on
know
why
.
<EOS>
the
oftener
you
make
them
rummage
their
own
mind
for
a
reason
,
the
more
manageable
you
will
find
them
in
all
the
relation
of
life
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
their
fault
(
poor
wretch
!
)
<EOS>
that
they
act
first
and
think
afterwards
;
it
be
the
fault
of
the
fool
who
humour
them
.
  
<EOS>
Penelope
's
reason
why
,
on
this
occasion
,
may
be
give
in
her
own
word
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
father
,
"
she
say
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
have
hurt
Rosanna
cruelly
,
without
intend
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
take
Rosanna
into
the
shrubbery
walk
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
own
madness
,
"
say
Penelope
;
"
I
can
call
it
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
She
be
bent
on
speak
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
this
morning
,
come
what
may
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
my
good
to
stop
her
;
you
see
that
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
only
have
get
her
away
before
she
hear
those
dreadful
word
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
there
!
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
do
not
lose
your
head
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
call
to
mind
that
anything
happen
to
alarm
Rosanna
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
nothing
to
alarm
her
,
father
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Franklin
say
he
take
no
interest
whatever
in
her
 
<EOS>
and
,
oh
,
he
say
it
in
such
a
cruel
voice
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
say
it
to
stop
the
Sergeant
's
mouth
,
"
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
her
that
,
"
say
Penelope
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
see
,
father
(
though
Mr.
Franklin
be
not
to
blame
)
,
he
be
be
mortify
and
disappoint
her
for
week
and
week
past
;
and
now
this
come
on
the
top
of
it
all
!
<EOS>
She
have
no
right
,
of
course
,
to
expect
him
to
take
any
interest
in
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
monstrous
that
she
should
forget
herself
and
her
station
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
but
she
seem
to
have
lose
pride
,
and
proper
feeling
,
and
everything
.
<EOS>
She
frighten
me
,
father
,
when
Mr.
Franklin
say
those
word
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
turn
her
into
stone
.
<EOS>
a
sudden
quiet
come
over
her
,
and
she
have
go
about
her
work
,
ever
since
,
like
a
woman
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
begin
to
feel
a
little
uneasy
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
way
Penelope
put
it
which
silence
my
superior
sense
.
<EOS>
I
call
to
mind
,
now
my
thought
be
direct
that
way
,
what
have
pass
between
Mr.
Franklin
and
Rosanna
overnight
.
<EOS>
She
look
cut
to
the
heart
on
that
occasion
;
and
now
,
as
ill
-
luck
would
have
it
,
she
have
be
unavoidably
sting
again
,
poor
soul
,
on
the
tender
place
.
<EOS>
sad
!
<EOS>
sad
!
 
<EOS>
all
the
more
sad
because
the
girl
have
no
reason
to
justify
her
,
and
no
right
to
feel
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
promise
Mr.
Franklin
to
speak
to
Rosanna
,
and
this
seem
the
fit
time
for
keep
my
word
.
  
<EOS>
We
find
the
girl
sweep
the
corridor
outside
the
bedroom
,
pale
and
compose
,
and
neat
as
ever
in
her
modest
print
dress
.
<EOS>
I
notice
a
curious
dimness
and
dullness
in
her
eye
 
not
as
if
she
have
be
cry
but
as
if
she
have
be
look
at
something
too
long
.
<EOS>
possibly
,
it
be
a
misty
something
raise
by
her
own
thought
.
<EOS>
there
be
certainly
no
object
about
her
to
look
at
which
she
have
not
see
already
hundred
on
hundred
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
cheer
up
,
Rosanna
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
fret
over
your
own
fancy
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
something
to
say
to
you
from
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
thereupon
put
the
matter
in
the
right
view
before
her
,
in
the
friendly
and
most
comforting
word
I
could
find
.
<EOS>
My
principle
,
in
regard
to
the
other
sex
,
be
,
as
you
may
have
notice
,
very
severe
.
<EOS>
but
somehow
or
other
,
when
I
come
face
to
face
with
the
woman
,
my
practice
(
I
own
)
be
not
conformable
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
be
very
kind
and
considerate
.
<EOS>
please
to
thank
him
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
the
answer
she
make
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
daughter
have
already
notice
that
Rosanna
go
about
her
work
like
a
woman
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
I
now
add
to
this
observation
,
that
she
also
listen
and
speak
like
a
woman
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
her
mind
be
in
a
fit
condition
to
take
in
what
I
have
say
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
quite
sure
,
Rosanna
,
that
you
understand
me
?
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
echo
me
,
not
like
a
live
woman
,
but
like
a
creature
move
by
machinery
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
sweep
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
take
away
the
broom
as
gently
and
as
kindly
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
my
girl
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
this
be
not
like
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
have
get
something
on
your
mind
.
<EOS>
I
be
your
friend
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
stand
your
friend
,
even
if
you
have
do
wrong
.
<EOS>
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
,
Rosanna
 
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
time
have
be
,
when
my
speaking
to
her
in
that
way
would
have
bring
the
tear
into
her
eye
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
no
change
in
them
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
will
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
to
my
lady
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
to
Mr.
Franklin
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
to
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
hardly
know
what
to
say
to
that
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
no
condition
to
understand
the
caution
against
speak
to
him
in
private
,
which
Mr.
Franklin
have
direct
me
to
give
her
.
<EOS>
feel
my
way
,
little
by
little
,
I
only
tell
her
Mr.
Franklin
have
go
out
for
a
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
do
not
matter
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
trouble
Mr.
Franklin
,
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
speak
to
my
lady
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
the
way
to
relieve
your
mind
be
to
speak
to
the
merciful
and
christian
mistress
who
have
always
be
kind
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
at
me
for
a
moment
with
a
grave
and
steady
attention
,
as
if
she
be
fix
what
I
say
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
then
she
take
the
broom
out
of
my
hand
and
move
off
with
it
slowly
,
a
little
way
down
the
corridor
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
she
say
,
go
on
with
her
sweeping
,
and
speak
to
herself
;
"
I
know
a
well
way
of
relieve
my
mind
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
please
to
let
me
go
on
with
my
work
.
"
  
<EOS>
Penelope
follow
her
,
and
offer
to
help
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
answer
,
"
no
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
do
my
work
.
<EOS>
thank
you
,
Penelope
.
"
<EOS>
She
look
round
at
me
.
"
<EOS>
thank
you
,
Mr.
Betteredge
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
move
her
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
more
to
be
say
.
<EOS>
I
sign
to
Penelope
to
come
away
with
me
.
<EOS>
We
leave
her
,
as
we
have
find
her
,
sweep
the
corridor
,
like
a
woman
in
a
dream
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
matter
for
the
doctor
to
look
into
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
beyond
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
daughter
remind
me
of
Mr.
Candy
's
illness
,
owing
(
as
you
may
remember
)
to
the
chill
he
have
catch
on
the
night
of
the
dinner
-
party
.
<EOS>
His
assistant
 
a
certain
Mr.
Ezra
Jennings
 
be
at
our
disposal
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
but
nobody
know
much
about
him
in
our
part
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
engage
by
Mr.
Candy
under
rather
peculiar
circumstance
;
and
,
right
or
wrong
,
we
none
of
us
like
him
or
trust
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
doctor
at
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
stranger
to
our
house
;
and
Penelope
doubt
,
in
Rosanna
's
present
state
,
whether
stranger
may
not
do
her
more
harm
than
good
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
of
speak
to
my
lady
.
<EOS>
but
,
remember
the
heavy
weight
of
anxiety
which
she
already
have
on
her
mind
,
I
hesitate
to
add
to
all
the
other
vexation
this
new
trouble
.
<EOS>
still
,
there
be
a
necessity
for
do
something
.
<EOS>
the
girl
's
state
be
,
to
my
thinking
,
downright
alarm
 
and
<EOS>
my
mistress
ought
to
be
inform
of
it
.
<EOS>
unwilling
enough
,
I
go
to
her
sit
-
room
.
<EOS>
no
one
be
there
.
<EOS>
My
lady
be
shut
up
with
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
see
her
till
she
come
out
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
wait
in
vain
till
the
clock
on
the
front
staircase
strike
the
quarter
to
two
.
<EOS>
five
minute
afterwards
,
I
hear
my
name
call
,
from
the
drive
outside
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
voice
directly
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
have
return
from
Frizinghall
.
    
<EOS>
go
down
to
the
front
door
,
I
meet
the
Sergeant
on
the
step
.
  
<EOS>
It
go
against
the
grain
with
me
,
after
what
have
pass
between
us
,
to
show
him
that
I
feel
any
sort
of
interest
in
his
proceeding
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
myself
,
however
,
I
feel
an
interest
that
there
be
no
resisting
.
<EOS>
My
sense
of
dignity
sink
from
under
me
,
and
out
come
the
word
:
"
<EOS>
what
news
from
Frizinghall
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
the
Indians
,
"
answer
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
have
find
out
what
Rosanna
buy
privately
in
the
town
,
on
Thursday
last
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
will
be
set
free
on
Wednesday
in
next
week
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
doubt
on
my
mind
,
and
there
be
not
a
doubt
on
Mr.
Murthwaite
's
mind
,
that
they
come
to
this
place
to
steal
the
Moonstone

I

"
Her

<EOS>
between

in
go
back
to

her
nightgown
must
have
brush
the
wet
paint
on
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
wash
out
the
stain
;
and
she
could
not
safely
destroy
the
night

gown
without
first
provide
another

to
make
the
inventory
of
her

the
pinch
of
the

be
 
why
,
after
have
provide
the
substitute
dress
,
do
she
hide
the
smear
nightgown
,
instead
of
destroy
it

<EOS>
if
the
girl
will
not
speak
out
,
there
be
only
one
way
of
settle
the
difficulty

<EOS>
the

"
I

His

I
could
have
cut

<EOS>
not

either
to

<EOS>
with

she
have
wrap
round
her

into
the

there

in

more

Miss

set
off
her
dark
complexion

her
tight
(
in
the
form
of
a
jacket
)

<EOS>
She

She

<EOS>
nothing
that
I

cut
him
short

passage

dreary

I

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
I
find
it
very
difficult
to
describe
how
I
be
affect
by
the
discovery

I
seem
to
be
in
fifty
different

all

in

I

Sergeant
Cuff
 
and
my
power
of
language
quite
fail
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
as
if
he
have
discover
the
uppermost
thought
in
me
,
and
be
pick
it
out
to
be
answer
,
before
all
the
rest

<EOS>
Your
young
friend
,
Rosanna
,
will
not
slip
through
my
finger
so
easy
as
you
think
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
I
know
where
Miss
Verinder
be
,
I
have
the
mean
at
my
disposal
of
trace
Miss
Verinder
's
accomplice
.
<EOS>
I
prevent
them
from
communicate
last
night
.
<EOS>
very
good
.
<EOS>
They
will
get
together
at
Frizinghall
,
instead
of
get
together
here
.
<EOS>
the
present
inquiry
must
be
simply
shift
(
rather
sooner
than
I
have
anticipate
)
from
this
house
,
to
the
house
at
which
Miss
Verinder
be
visit
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
I
be
afraid
I
must
trouble
you
to
call
the
servant
together
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
go
round
with
him
to
the
servant
'
hall
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
disgraceful
,
but
it
be
not
the
less
true
,
that
I
have
another
attack
of
the
detective
-
fever
,
when
he
say
those
last
word
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
that
I
hate
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
I
seize
him
confidentially
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
for
goodness
'
sake
,
tell
us
what
you
be
go
to
do
with
the
servant
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
great
Cuff
stand
stock
still
,
and
address
himself
in
a
kind
of
melancholy
rapture
to
the
empty
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
this
man
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
(
apparently
mean
me
)
,
"
only
understand
the
growing
of
rose
he
would
be
the
most
completely
perfect
character
on
the
face
of
creation
!
"
<EOS>
after
that
strong
expression
of
feeling
,
he
sigh
,
and
put
his
arm
through
mine
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
how
it
stand
,
"
he
say
,
drop
down
again
to
business
.
"
<EOS>
Rosanna
have
do
one
of
two
thing
.
<EOS>
She
have
either
go
direct
to
Frizinghall
(
before
I
can
get
there
)
,
or
she
have
go
first
to
visit
her
hiding
-
place
at
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
to
find
out
be
,
which
of
the
servant
see
the
last
of
her
before
she
leave
the
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
institute
this
inquiry
,
it
turn
out
that
the
last
person
who
have
set
eye
on
Rosanna
be
Nancy
,
the
kitchenmaid
.
  
<EOS>
Nancy
have
see
her
slip
out
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
,
and
stop
the
butcher
's
man
who
have
just
be
deliver
some
meat
at
the
back
door
.
<EOS>
Nancy
have
hear
her
ask
the
man
to
post
the
letter
when
he
get
back
to
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
look
at
the
address
,
and
have
say
it
be
a
roundabout
way
of
deliver
a
letter
direct
to
Cobb
's
Hole
,
to
post
it
at
Frizinghall
 
and
that
,
moreover
,
on
a
Saturday
,
which
would
prevent
the
letter
from
get
to
its
destination
until
Monday
morning
,
Rosanna
have
answer
that
the
delivery
of
the
letter
be
delay
till
Monday
be
of
no
importance
.
<EOS>
the
only
thing
she
wish
to
be
sure
of
be
that
the
man
would
do
what
she
tell
him
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
promise
to
do
it
,
and
have
drive
away
.
<EOS>
Nancy
have
be
call
back
to
her
work
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
and
no
other
person
have
see
anything
afterwards
of
Rosanna
Spearman
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
when
we
be
alone
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
to
Frizinghall

"
<EOS>
about
the
letter
,
sir
?

"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
the
memorandum
of
the
hiding
-
place
be
in
that
letter
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
the
address
at
the
post
-
office
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
the
address
<EOS>
I
suspect
,
I
shall
pay
our
friend
,
Mrs.
Yolland
,
another
visit
on
Monday
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
go
with
the
Sergeant
to
order
the
pony
-
chaise
.
<EOS>
in
the
stable
-
yard
we
get
a
new
light
throw
on
the
miss
girl
.
    
<EOS>
the
news
of
Rosanna
's
disappearance
have
,
as
it
appear
,
spread
among
the
out
-
of
-
door
servant
.
<EOS>
They
too
have
make
their
inquiry
;
and
they
have
just
lay
hand
on
a
quick
little
imp
,
nickname
"
Duffy
"
 
who
be
occasionally
employ
in
weed
the
garden
,
and
who
have
see
Rosanna
Spearman
as
lately
as
half
-
an
-
hour
since
.
<EOS>
Duffy
be
certain
that
the
girl
have
pass
him
in
the
fir
-
plantation
,
not
walk
,
but
running
,
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
-
shore
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
this
boy
know
the
coast
hereabouts
?
"
ask
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
bear
and
breed
on
the
coast
,
"
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Duffy
!
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
"
do
you
want
to
earn
a
shilling
?
<EOS>
if
you
do
,
come
along
with
me
.
<EOS>
keep
the
pony
-
chaise
ready
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
till
I
come
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
start
for
the
Shivering
Sand
,
at
a
rate
that
my
leg
(
though
well
enough
preserve
for
my
time
of
life
)
have
no
hope
of
match
.
<EOS>
Little
Duffy
,
as
the
way
be
with
the
young
savage
in
our
part
when
they
be
in
high
spirit
,
give
a
howl
,
and
trot
off
at
the
Sergeant
's
heel
.
  
<EOS>
here
again
,
I
find
it
impossible
to
give
anything
like
a
clear
account
of
the
state
of
my
mind
in
the
interval
after
Sergeant
Cuff
have
leave
us
.
<EOS>
a
curious
and
stupefying
restlessness
get
possession
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
a
dozen
different
needless
thing
in
and
out
of
the
house
,
not
one
of
which
I
can
now
remember
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
even
know
how
long
it
be
after
the
Sergeant
have
go
to
the
sand
,
when
Duffy
come
run
back
with
a
message
for
me
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
have
give
the
boy
a
leaf
tear
out
of
his
pocket
-
book
,
on
which
be
write
in
pencil
,
"
send
me
one
of
Rosanna
Spearman
's
boot
,
and
be
quick
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
despatch
the
first
woman
-
servant
I
could
find
to
Rosanna
's
room
;
and
I
send
the
boy
back
to
say
that
I
myself
would
follow
him
with
the
boot
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
I
be
well
aware
,
be
not
the
quick
way
to
take
of
obey
the
direction
which
I
have
receive
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
resolve
to
see
for
myself
what
new
mystification
be
go
on
before
I
trust
Rosanna
's
boot
in
the
Sergeant
's
hand
.
<EOS>
My
old
notion
of
screen
the
girl
,
if
I
could
,
seem
to
have
come
back
on
me
again
,
at
the
eleventh
hour
.
<EOS>
this
state
of
feeling
(
to
say
nothing
of
the
detective
-
fever
)
hurry
me
off
,
as
soon
as
I
have
get
the
boot
,
at
the
near
approach
to
a
run
which
a
man
turn
seventy
can
reasonably
hope
to
make
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
get
near
the
shore
,
the
cloud
gather
black
,
and
the
rain
come
down
,
drift
in
great
white
sheet
of
water
before
the
wind
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
thunder
of
the
sea
on
the
sand
-
bank
at
the
mouth
of
the
bay
.
<EOS>
a
little
further
on
,
I
pass
the
boy
crouch
for
shelter
under
the
lee
of
the
sand
hill
.
<EOS>
then
I
see
the
rage
sea
,
and
the
roller
tumble
in
on
the
sand
-
bank
,
and
the
drive
rain
sweep
over
the
water
like
a
flying
garment
,
and
the
yellow
wilderness
of
the
beach
with
one
solitary
black
figure
stand
on
it
 
the
figure
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
He
wave
his
hand
towards
the
north
,
when
he
first
see
me
.
"
<EOS>
keep
on
that
side
!
"
<EOS>
he
shout
.
<EOS>
"
and
come
on
down
here
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
go
down
to
him
,
choke
for
breath
,
with
my
heart
leaping
as
if
it
be
like
to
leap
out
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
past
speak
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
hundred
question
to
put
to
him
;
and
not
one
of
them
would
pass
my
lip
.
<EOS>
His
face
frighten
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
look
in
his
eye
which
be
a
look
of
horror
.
<EOS>
He
snatch
the
boot
out
of
my
hand
,
and
set
it
in
a
footmark
on
the
sand
,
bear
south
from
us
as
we
stand
,
and
point
straight
towards
the
rocky
ledge
call
the
South
Spit
.
<EOS>
the
mark
be
not
yet
blur
out
by
the
rain
 
and
the
girl
's
boot
fit
it
to
a
hair
.
  
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
point
to
the
boot
in
the
footmark
,
without
say
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
I
catch
at
his
arm
,
and
try
to
speak
to
him
,
and
fail
as
I
have
fail
when
I
try
before
.
<EOS>
He
go
on
,
follow
the
footstep
down
and
down
to
where
the
rock
and
the
sand
join
.
<EOS>
the
South
Spit
be
just
awash
with
the
flow
tide
;
the
water
heave
over
the
hidden
face
of
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
now
this
way
and
now
that
,
with
an
obstinate
patience
that
be
dreadful
to
see
,
Sergeant
Cuff
try
the
boot
in
the
footstep
,
and
always
find
it
point
the
same
way
 
straight
to
the
rock
.
<EOS>
Hunt
as
he
may
,
no
sign
could
he
find
anywhere
of
the
footstep
walk
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
give
it
up
at
last
.
<EOS>
still
keep
silence
,
he
look
again
at
me
;
and
then
he
look
out
at
the
water
before
us
,
heave
in
deep
and
deep
over
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
I
look
where
he
look
 
<EOS>
and
I
see
his
thought
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
a
dreadful
dumb
tremble
crawl
all
over
me
on
a
sudden
.
<EOS>
I
fall
upon
my
knee
on
the
beach
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
be
back
at
the
hiding
-
place
,
"
<EOS>
I
hear
the
Sergeant
say
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
some
fatal
accident
have
happen
to
her
on
those
rock
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
girl
's
alter
look
,
and
word
,
and
action
 
the
numb
,
deaden
way
in
which
she
listen
to
me
,
and
speak
to
me
 
when
I
have
find
her
sweep
the
corridor
but
a
few
hour
since
,
rise
up
in
my
mind
,
and
warn
me
,
even
as
the
Sergeant
speak
,
that
his
guess
be
wide
of
the
dreadful
truth
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
tell
him
of
the
fear
that
have
freeze
me
up
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
say
,
"
the
death
she
have
die
,
Sergeant
,
be
a
death
of
her
own
seeking
.
"
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
the
word
would
not
come
.
<EOS>
the
dumb
tremble
hold
me
in
its
grip
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
feel
the
drive
rain
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
the
rise
tide
.
<EOS>
as
in
the
vision
of
a
dream
,
the
poor
lose
creature
come
back
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
again
as
I
have
see
her
in
the
past
time
 
on
the
morning
when
I
go
to
fetch
her
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
hear
her
again
,
tell
me
that
the
Shivering
Sand
seem
to
draw
her
to
it
against
her
will
,
and
wonder
whether
her
grave
be
wait
for
her
THERE
.
<EOS>
the
horror
of
it
strike
at
me
,
in
some
unfathomable
way
,
through
my
own
child
.
<EOS>
My
girl
be
just
her
age
.
<EOS>
My
girl
,
try
as
Rosanna
be
try
,
may
have
live
that
miserable
life
,
and
die
this
dreadful
death
.
  
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
kindly
lift
me
up
,
and
turn
me
away
from
the
sight
of
the
place
where
she
have
perish
.
  
<EOS>
with
that
relief
,
I
begin
to
fetch
my
breath
again
,
and
to
see
thing
about
me
,
as
thing
really
be
.
<EOS>
look
towards
the
sand
-
hill
,
I
see
the
man
-
servant
from
out
-
of
-
door
,
and
the
fisherman
,
name
Yolland
,
all
run
down
to
us
together
;
and
all
,
have
take
the
alarm
,
call
out
to
know
if
the
girl
have
be
find
.
<EOS>
in
the
few
word
,
the
Sergeant
show
them
the
evidence
of
the
footmark
,
and
tell
them
that
a
fatal
accident
must
have
happen
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
then
pick
out
the
fisherman
from
the
rest
,
and
put
a
question
to
him
,
turn
about
again
towards
the
sea
:
"
tell
me
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
Could
a
boat
have
take
her
off
,
in
such
weather
as
this
,
from
those
rock
where
her
footmark
stop
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
fisherman
point
to
the
roller
tumble
in
on
the
sand
-
bank
,
and
to
the
great
wave
leap
up
in
cloud
of
foam
against
the
headland
on
either
side
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
boat
that
ever
be
build
,
"
he
answer
,
"
could
have
get
to
her
through
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
look
for
the
last
time
at
the
foot
-
mark
on
the
sand
,
which
the
rain
be
now
fast
blur
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
he
say
,
"
be
the
evidence
that
she
can
not
have
leave
this
place
by
land
.
<EOS>
and
here
,
"
he
go
on
,
look
at
the
fisherman
,
"
be
the
evidence
that
she
can
not
have
get
away
by
sea
.
"
<EOS>
He
stop
,
and
consider
for
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
see
run
towards
this
place
,
half
an
hour
before
I
get
here
from
the
house
,
"
he
say
to
Yolland
.
<EOS>
"
some
time
have
pass
since
then
.
<EOS>
call
it
,
altogether
,
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
how
high
would
the
water
be
,
at
that
time
,
on
this
side
of
the
rock
?
"
<EOS>
He
point
to
the
south
side
 
otherwise
,
the
side
which
be
not
fill
up
by
the
quicksand
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
the
tide
make
to
-
day
,
"
say
the
fisherman
,
"
there
would
not
have
be
water
enough
to
drown

<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff

about
northward
,
towards
the
quicksand
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
much
on
this
side
?
"
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
less
still
,
"
answer
Yolland
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Shivering
Sand
would
have
be
just
awash
,
and
no
more

"
  
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
turn
to
me
,
and
say
that
the
accident
must
have
happen
on
the
side
of
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
My
tongue
be
loosen
at
that
.
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
.
<EOS>
"
when

come
to
this
place
,
she
come
weary
of
her
life
,
to
end
it
here
.

<EOS>
He
start
back
from

<EOS>
"
how
do
you
know

he
ask
.
<EOS>
the

round
.
<EOS>

himself
instantly
.
<EOS>
He
put
them
back
from
me
;
he
say
I
be
an
old
man
;
he
say
the
discovery
have
shake
me
;
he
say
,
"
let
him
alone
a
little
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
turn
to
Yolland
,
and
ask
,
"
be
there
any
chance
of
find
her
,
when
the
tide
ebb
again

"
<EOS>
and
Yolland
answer
,
"
none

<EOS>
what
the

"
<EOS>
have
say
that
,

a
step
nearer

and
address
himself
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
about
the
young
woman
's
death

<EOS>
four
foot
out
,
broadwise
,
along
the
side
of
the
Spit
,
there
be
a
shelf
of
rock
,
about
half
fathom
down
under
the
sand
.
<EOS>
My
question
be
 
why
do
not
she
strike
that
?
<EOS>
if
she
slip
,
by
accident
,
from
off
the
Spit
,
she
fall
in
where
there
be
foothold
at
the
bottom
,
at
a
depth
that
would
barely
cover
her
to
the
waist
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
wade
out
,
or
jump
out
,
into
the
Deeps
beyond
 
<EOS>
or
she
would
not
be
miss
now
.
<EOS>
no
accident
,
sir
!
<EOS>
the
deep
of
the
Quicksand
have
get
her
.
<EOS>
and
they
have
get
her
by
her
own
act
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
testimony
from
a
man
whose
knowledge
be
to
be
rely
on
,
the
Sergeant
be
silent
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
us
,
like
him
,
hold
our
peace
.
<EOS>
with
one
accord
,
we
all
turn
back
up
the
slope
of
the
beach
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
sand
-
hillock
we
be
meet
by
the
under

from

have
an
honest
respect

<EOS>
He
hand
me
a
little
note
,
with
a
decent
sorrow
in
his
face
.
"
<EOS>
Penelope

Mr.

he
say

"
She

<EOS>
It
be
her
last
farewell
word

the

have
do
his

God

You

when
you
next
see
the
Shivering
Sand

try
to
forgive
me
once
more

<EOS>
I
have
find
my

<EOS>
I

live

grateful

your
kindness

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
little
as
it
be
,
I
have
not
manhood
enough
to
hold
up
against
it

<EOS>
Your
tear
come
easy

when

the
world

Your
tear
come
easy

out

Sergeant
Cuff
take
a
step
nearer

me
 
mean
kindly
,
I
do
not

I
shrink
back
from
him

<EOS>
do
not

I
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
dread
of
you

that
have
drive
her
to
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
wrong
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
answer
,
quietly
.
"
<EOS>
but
there
will
be
time
enough
to
speak
of
it
when
we
be
indoor
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
follow
the
rest
of
them
,
with
the
help
of
the
groom
's
arm
.
<EOS>
through
the
drive
rain
we
go
back
 
to
meet
the
trouble
and
the
terror
that
be
wait
for
us
at
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
those
in
front
have
spread
the
news
before
us
.
<EOS>
We
find
the
servant
in
a
state
of
panic
.
<EOS>
as
we
pass
my
lady
's
door
,
it
be
throw
open
violently
from
the
inner
side
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
come
out
among
us
(
with
Mr.
Franklin
follow
,
and
try
vainly
to
compose
her
)
,
quite
beside
herself
with
the
horror
of
the
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
answerable
for
this
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
out
,
threaten
the
Sergeant
wildly
with
her
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
give
that
wretch
his
money
 
and
release
me
from
the
sight
of
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
be
the
only
one
among
us
who
be
fit
to
cope
with
her
 
be
the
only
one
among
us
who
be
in
possession
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
no
more
answerable
for
this
distress
calamity
,
my
lady
,
than
you
be
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
if
,
in
half
an
hour
from
this
,
you
still
insist
on
my
leave
the
house
,
I
will
accept
your
ladyship
's
dismissal
,
but
not
your
ladyship
's
money
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
speak
very
respectfully
,
but
very
firmly
at
the
same
time
 
<EOS>
and
it
have
its
effect
on
my
mistress
as
well
as
on
me
.
<EOS>
She
suffer
Mr.
Franklin
to
lead
her
back
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
as
the
door
close
on
the
two
,
the
Sergeant
,
look
about
among
the
woman
-
servant
in
his
observant
way
,
notice
that
while
all
the
rest
be
merely
frightened
,
Penelope
be
in
tear
.
<EOS>
"
when
your
father
have
change
his
wet
clothe
,
"
he
say
to
her
,
"
come
and
speak
to
us
,
in
your
father
's
room
.
"
  
<EOS>
before
the
half
-
hour
be
out
,
I
have
get
my
dry
clothe
on
,
and
have
lend
Sergeant
Cuff
such
change
of
dress
as
he
require
.
<EOS>
Penelope
come
in
to
us
to
hear
what
the
Sergeant
want
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
ever
feel
what
a
good
dutiful
daughter
I
have
,
so
strongly
as
I
feel
it
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
I
take
her
and
sit
her
on
my
knee
and
I
pray
God
bless
her
.
<EOS>
She
hide
her
head
on
my
bosom
,
and
put
her
arm
<EOS>
round
my
neck
 
<EOS>
and
we
wait
a
little
while
in
silence
.
<EOS>
the
poor
dead
girl
must
have
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
I
think
,
with
my
daughter
and
with
me
.
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
go
to
the
window
,
and
stand
there
look
out
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
right
to
thank
him
for
consider
us
both
in
this
way
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
People
in
high
life
have
all
the
luxury
to
themselves
 
among
other
,
the
luxury
of
indulge
their
feeling
.
<EOS>
People
in
low
life
have
no
such
privilege
.
<EOS>
necessity
,
which
spare
our
better
,
have
no
pity
on
us
.
<EOS>
We
learn
to
put
our
feeling
back
into
ourselves
,
and
to
jog
on
with
our
duty
as
patiently
as
may
be
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
complain
of
this
 
<EOS>
I
only
notice
it
.
<EOS>
penelope
and
I
be
ready
for
the
Sergeant
,
as
soon
as
the
Sergeant
be
ready
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
ask
if
she
know
what
have
lead
her
fellow
-
servant
to
destroy
herself
,
my
daughter
answer
(
as
you
will
foresee
)
that
it
be
for
love
of
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
ask
next
,
if
she
have
mention
this
notion
of
her
to
any
other
person
,
Penelope
answer
,
"
I
have
not
mention
it
,
for
Rosanna
's
sake
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
necessary
to
add
a
word
to
this
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
<EOS>
and
for
Mr.
Franklin
's
sake
,
my
dear
,
as
well
.
<EOS>
if
Rosanna
have
die
for
love
of
him
,
it
be
not
with
his
knowledge
or
by
his
fault
.
<EOS>
let
him
leave
the
house
to
-
day
,
if
he
do
leave
it
,
without
the
useless
pain
of
know
the
truth
.
"
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
say
,
"
quite
right
,
"
and
fall
silent
again
;
compare
Penelope
's
notion
(
as
it
seem
to
me
)
with
some
other
notion
of
his
own
which
he
keep
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
half
-
hour
,
my
mistress
's
bell
rang
.
  
<EOS>
on
my
way
to
answer
it
,
I
meet
Mr.
Franklin
come
out
of
his
aunt
's
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
mention
that
her
ladyship
be
ready
to
see
Sergeant
Cuff
 
in
my
presence
as
before
 
<EOS>
and
he
add
that
he
himself
want
to
say
two
word
to
the
Sergeant
first
.
<EOS>
on
our
way
back
to
my
room
,
he
stop
,
and
look
at
the
railway
time
-
table
in
the
hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
really
go
to
leave
us
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
will
surely
come
right
again
,
if
you
only
give
her
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
come
right
again
,
"
answer
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
when
she
hear
that
I
have
go
away
,
and
that
she
will
see
me
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
he
speak
in
resentment
of
my
young
lady
's
treatment
of
him
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
have
notice
,
from
the
time
when
the
police
first
come
into
the
house
,
that
the
bare
mention
of
him
be
enough
to
set
Miss
Rachel
's
temper
in
a
flame
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
too
fond
of
his
cousin
to
like
to
confess
this
to
himself
,
until
the
truth
have
be
force
on
him
,
when
she
drive
off
to
her
aunt
's
.
<EOS>
His
eye
once
open
in
that
cruel
way
which
you
know
of
,
Mr.
Franklin
have
take
his
resolution
 
the
one
resolution
which
a
man
of
any
spirit
COULD
take
 
to
leave
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
what
he
have
to
say
to
the
Sergeant
be
speak
in
my
presence
.
<EOS>
He
describe
her
ladyship
as
willing
to
acknowledge
that
she
have
speak
over
-
hastily
.
<EOS>
and
he
ask
if
Sergeant
Cuff
would
consent
 
in
that
case
 
to
accept
his
fee
,
and
to
leave
the
matter
of
the
Diamond
where
the
matter
stand
now
.
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
answer
,
"
no
,
sir
.
<EOS>
My
fee
be
pay
me
for
do
my
duty
.
<EOS>
I
decline
to
take
it
,
until
my
duty
be
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
,
"
say
Mr.
Franklin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
explain
myself
,
sir
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
come
here
,
I
undertake
to
throw
the
necessary
light
on
the
matter
of
the
miss
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
ready
,
and
wait
to
redeem
my
pledge
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
state
the
case
to
Lady
Verinder
as
the
case
now
stand
,
and
when
I
have
tell
her
plainly
what
course
of
action
to
take
for
the
recovery
of
the
Moonstone
,
the
responsibility
will
be
off
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
let
her
ladyship
decide
,
after
that
,
whether
she
do
,
or
do
not
,
allow
me
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
shall
then
have
do
what
I
undertake
to
do
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
take
my
fee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
those
word
Sergeant
Cuff
remind
us
that
,
even
in
the
Detective
Police
,
a
man
may
have
a
reputation
to
lose
.
  
<EOS>
the
view
he
take
be
so
plainly
the
right
one
,
that
there
be
no
more
to
be
say
.
<EOS>
as
I
rise
to
conduct
him
to
my
lady
's
room
,
he
ask
if
Mr.
Franklin
wish
to
be
present
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
answer
,
"
not
unless
Lady
Verinder
desire
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
add
,
in
a
whisper
to
me
,
as
I
be
follow
the
Sergeant
out
,
"
I
know
what
that
man
be
go
to
say
about
Rachel
;
and
I
be
too
fond
of
her
to
hear
it
,
and
keep
my
temper
.
<EOS>
leave
me
by
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
leave
him
,
miserable
enough
,
lean
on
the
sill
of
my
window
,
with
his
face
hide
in
his
hand
and
Penelope
peep
through
the
door
,
long
to
comfort
him
.
<EOS>
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
place
,
I
should
have
call
her
in
.
<EOS>
when
you
be
ill
-
use
by
one
woman
,
there
be
great
comfort
in
tell
it
to
another
 
because
,
nine
time
out
of
ten
,
the
other
always
take
your
side
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
when
my
back
be
turn
,
he
do
call
her
in
?
<EOS>
in
that
case
it
be
only
do
my
daughter
justice
to
declare
that
she
would
stick
at
nothing
,
in
the
way
of
comfort
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
Sergeant
Cuff
and
I
proceed
to
my
lady
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
last
conference
we
have
hold
with
her
,
we
have
find
her
not
over
willing
to
lift
her
eye
from
the
book
which
she
have
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
there
be
a
change
for
the
well
.
<EOS>
She
meet
the
Sergeant
's
eye
with
an
eye
that
be
as
steady
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
the
family
spirit
show
itself
in
every
line
of
her
face
;
and
I
know
that
Sergeant
Cuff
would
meet
his
match
,
when
a
woman
like
my
mistress
be
string
up
to
hear
the
bad
he
could
say
to
her
.
    
<EOS>
the
first
word
,
when
we
have
take
our
seat
,
be
speak
by
my
lady
.

Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
she
say
,
"
there
be
perhaps
some
excuse
for
the
inconsiderate
manner
in
which
I
speak
to
you
half
an
hour
since
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
wish
,
however
,
to
claim
that
excuse
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
with
perfect
sincerity
,
that
I
regret
it
,
if
I
wrong
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
grace
of
voice
and
manner
with
which
she
make
him
that
atonement
have
its
due
effect
on
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
He
request
permission
to
justify
himself
 
put
his
justification
as
an
act
of
respect
to
my
mistress
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
,
he
say
,
that
he
could
be
in
any
way
responsible
for
the
calamity
,
which
have
shock
us
all
,
for
this
sufficient
reason
,
that
his
success
in
bring
his
inquiry
to
its
proper
end
depend
on
his
neither
say
nor
do
anything
that
could
alarm
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
He
appeal
to
me
to
testify
whether
he
have
,
or
have
not
,
carry
that
object
out
.
<EOS>
I
could
,
and
do
,
bear
witness
that
he
have
.
<EOS>
and
there
,
as
I
think
,
the
matter
may
have
be
judiciously
leave
to
come
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
,
however
,
take
it
a
step
further
,
evidently
(
as
you
shall
now
judge
)
with
the
purpose
of
force
the
most
painful
of
all
possible
explanation
to
take
place
between
her
ladyship
and
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
a
motive
assign
for
the
young
woman
's
suicide
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
"
which
may
possibly
be
the
right
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
motive
quite
unconnected
with
the
case
which
I
be
conduct
here
.
<EOS>
I
be
bind
to
add
,
however
,
that
my
own
opinion
point
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
some
unbearable
anxiety
in
connexion
with
the
miss
Diamond
,
have
,
I
believe
,
drive
the
poor
creature
to
her
own
destruction
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
know
what
that
unbearable
anxiety
may
have
be
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
(
with
your
ladyship
's
permission
)
I
can
lay
my
hand
on
a
person
who
be
capable
of
decide
whether
I
be
right
or
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
the
person
now
in
the
house
?
"
<EOS>
my
mistress
ask
,
after
wait
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
person
have
leave
the
house
,
my
lady
.
"
  
<EOS>
that
answer
point
as
straight
to
Miss
Rachel
as
straight
could
be
.
<EOS>
a
silence
drop
on
us
which
I
think
would
never
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
the
wind
howl
,
and
how
the
rain
drive
at
the
window
,
as
I
sit
there
wait
for
one
or
other
of
them
to
speak
again
!
  
<EOS>
"
be
so
good
as
to
express
yourself
plainly
,
"
say
my
lady
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
refer
to
my
daughter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
say
Sergeant
Cuff
,
in
so
many
word
.
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
have
her
cheque
-
book
on
the
table
when
we
enter
the
room
 
no
doubt
to
pay
the
Sergeant
his
fee
.
<EOS>
She
now
put
it
back
in
the
drawer
.
<EOS>
It
go
to
my
heart
to
see
how
her
poor
hand
tremble
 
the
hand
that
have
load
her
old
servant
with
benefit
;
the
hand
that
,
I
pray
God
,
may
take
mine
,
when
my
time
come
,
and
I
leave
my
place
for
ever
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hope
,
"
say
my
lady
,
very
slowly
and
quietly
,
"
to
have
recompense
your
service
,
and
to
have
part
with
you
without
Miss
Verinder
's
name
have
be
openly
mention
between
us
as
it
have
be
mention
now
.
<EOS>
My
nephew
have
probably
say
something
of
this
,
before
you
come
into
my
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Blake
give
his
message
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
and
I
give
Mr.
Blake
a
reason
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
be
needless
to
tell
me
your
reason
.
<EOS>
after
what
you
have
just
say
,
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
you
have
go
too
far
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
I
owe
it
to
myself
,
and
I
owe
it
to
my
child

to
insist
on
your
remain
here
,

to
insist
on
your
speak
out

<EOS>
the
Sergeant
look
at
his
watch
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
there
have
be
time
,
my
lady

he
answer
,
"
I
should
have
prefer
write
my
report
,
instead
of
communicate
it
by
word
of
mouth

<EOS>
but
,
if
this
inquiry
be
to
go
on
,
time
be
of
too
much
importance
to
be
waste
in
writing
.
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
go
into
the
matter
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
painful
matter
for
me
to
speak
of
,
and
for
you
to
hear
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
my
mistress
stop
him
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
possibly
make
it
less
painful
to
you
,
and
to
my
good
servant
and
friend
here
,

she
say
,
"
if
I
set
the
example
of
speak
boldly
,
on
my
side

You
suspect
Miss
Verinder
of
deceive
us
all
,
by
secrete
the
Diamond
for
some
purpose
of
her
own
?
<EOS>
be
that
true
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
true
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
.
<EOS>
now
,
before
you
begin
,
I
have
to
tell
you
,
as
Miss
Verinder
's
mother
,
that
she
be
absolutely
INCAPABLE
of
do
what
you
suppose
her
to
have
do
.
<EOS>
Your
knowledge
of
her
character
date
from
a
day
or
two
since
.
<EOS>
My
knowledge
of
her
character
date
from
the
beginning
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
state
your
suspicion
of
her
as
strongly
as
you
please
 
<EOS>
it
be
impossible
that
you
can
offend
me
by
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
beforehand
,
that
(
with
all
your
experience
)
the
circumstance
have
fatally
mislead
you
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
mind
!
<EOS>
I
be
in
possession
of
no
private
information
.
<EOS>
I
be
as
absolutely
shut
out
of
my
daughter
's
confidence
as
you
be
.
<EOS>
My
one
reason
for
speak
positively
,
be
the
reason
you
have
hear
already
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
turn
to
me
,
and
give
me
her
hand
.
<EOS>
I
kiss
it
in
silence
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
on
,
"
she
say
,
face
the
Sergeant
again
as
steadily
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
bow
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
have
produce
but
one
effect
on
him
.
<EOS>
His
hatchet
-
face
soften
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
be
sorry
for
her
.
<EOS>
as
to
shake
him
in
his
own
conviction
,
it
be
plain
to
see
that
she
have
not
move
him
by
a
single
inch
.
<EOS>
He
settle
himself
in
his
chair
;
and
he
begin
his
vile
attack
on
Miss
Rachel
's
character
in
these
word
:
  
"
I
must
ask
your
ladyship
,
"
he
say
,
"
to
look
this
matter
in
the
face
,
from
my
point
of
view
as
well
as
from
yours
.
<EOS>
Will
you
please
to
suppose
yourself
come
down
here
,
in
my
place
,
and
with
my
experience
?
<EOS>
and
will
you
allow
me
to
mention
very
briefly
what
that
experience
have
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
sign
to
him
that
she
would
do
this
.
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
go
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
for
the
last
twenty
year
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
have
be
largely
employ
in
case
of
family
scandal
,
act
in
the
capacity
of
confidential
man
.
<EOS>
the
one
result
of
my
domestic
practice
which
have
any
bearing
on
the
matter
now
in
hand
,
be
a
result
which
I
may
state
in
two
word
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
within
my
experience
,
that
young
lady
of
rank
and
position
do
occasionally
have
private
debt
which
they
dare
not
acknowledge
to
their
near
relative
and
friend
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
the
milliner
and
the
jeweller
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
the
money
be
want
for
purpose
which
I
do
not
suspect
in
this
case
,
and
which
I
will
not
shock
you
by
mention
.
<EOS>
bear
in
mind
<EOS>
what
I
have
say
,
my
lady
 
<EOS>
and
now
let
us
see
how
event
in
this
house
have
force
me
back
on
my
own
experience
,
whether
I
like
it
or
not
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
consider
with
himself
for
a
moment
,
and
go
on
 
with
a
horrid
clearness
that
oblige
you
to
understand
him
;
with
an
abominable
justice
that
favour
nobody
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
first
information
relate
to
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
"
come
to
me
from
Superintendent
Seegrave
.
<EOS>
He
prove
to
my
complete
satisfaction
that
he
be
perfectly
incapable
of
manage
the
case
.
<EOS>
the
one
thing
he
say
which
strike
me
as
worth
listen
to
,
be
this
 
that
Miss
Verinder
have
decline
to
be
question
by
him
,
and
have
speak
to
him
with
a
perfectly
incomprehensible
rudeness
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
think
this
curious
 
<EOS>
but
I
attribute
it
mainly
to
some
clumsiness
on
the
Superintendent
's
part
which
may
have
offend
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
I
put
it
by
in
my
mind
,
and
apply
myself
,
single
-
handed
,
to
the
case
.
<EOS>
It
end
,
as
you
be
aware
,
in
the
discovery
of
the
smear
on
the
door
,
and
in
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
evidence
satisfy
me
,
that
this
same
smear
,
and
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
,
be
piece
of
the
same
puzzle
.
<EOS>
so
far
,
if
I
suspect
anything
,
I
suspect
that
the
Moonstone
have
be
steal
,
and
that
one
of
the
servant
may
prove
to
be
the
thief
.
<EOS>
very
good
.
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
thing
,
what
happen
?
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
suddenly
come
out
of
her
room
,
and
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
observe
three
suspicious
appearance
in
that
young
lady
.
<EOS>
She
be
still
violently
agitate
,
though
more
than
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
have
pass
since
the
Diamond
be
lose
.
<EOS>
She
treat
me
as
she
have
already
treat
Superintendent
Seegrave
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
mortally
offend
with
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
very
good
again
.
<EOS>
here
(
I
say
to
myself
)
be
a
young
lady
who
have
lose
a
valuable
jewel
 
a
young
lady
,
also
,
as
my
own
eye
and
ear
inform
me
,
who
be
of
an
impetuous
temperament
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
and
with
that
character
,
what
do
she
do
?
<EOS>
She
betray
an
incomprehensible
resentment
against
Mr.
Blake
,
Mr.
Superintendent
,
and
myself
 
<EOS>
otherwise
,
the
very
three
people
who
have
all
,
in
their
different
way
,
be
try
to
help
her
to
recover
her
lost
jewel
.
<EOS>
have
bring
my
inquiry
to
that
point
 
then
,
my
lady
,
and
not
till
then
,
I
begin
to
look
back
into
my
own
mind
for
my
own
experience
.
<EOS>
My
own
experience
explain
Miss
Verinder
's
otherwise
incomprehensible
conduct
.
<EOS>
It
associate
her
with
those
other
young
lady
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
It
tell
me
she
have
debt
she
dare
not
acknowledge
,
that
must
be
pay
.
<EOS>
and
it
set
me
ask
myself
,
whether
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
may
not
mean
 
that
the
Diamond
must
be
secretly
pledge
to
pay
them
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
conclusion
which
my
experience
draw
from
plain
fact
.
<EOS>
what
do
your
ladyship
's
experience
say
against
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
have
say
already
,
"
answer
my
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
the
circumstance
have
mislead
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
ROBINSON
crusoe
 
<EOS>
God
know
how
 
have
get
into
my
muddled
old
head
.
<EOS>
if
Sergeant
Cuff
have
find
himself
,
at
that
moment
,
transport
to
a
desert
island
,
without
a
man
Friday
to
keep
him
company
,
or
a
ship
to
take
him
off
 
<EOS>
he
would
have
find
himself
exactly
where
I
wish
him
to
be
!
<EOS>
(
Nota
bene
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
an
average
good
Christian
,
when
you
do
not
push
my
Christianity
too
far
.
<EOS>
and
all
the
rest
of
you
 
which
be
a
great
comfort
 
be
,
in
this
respect
,
much
the
same
as
I
be
.
)
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
go
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
right
or
wrong
,
my
lady
,
"
he
say
,
"
have
draw
my
conclusion
,
the
next
thing
to
do
be
to
put
it
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
I
suggest
to
your
ladyship
the
examination
of
all
the
wardrobe
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
means
of
find
the
article
of
dress
which
have
,
in
all
probability
,
make
the
smear
;
and
it
be
a
means
of
put
my
conclusion
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
how
do
it
turn
out
?
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
consent
;
Mr.
Blake
consent
;
Mr.
Ablewhite
consent
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
alone
stop
the
whole
proceeding
by
refuse
point
-
blank
.
<EOS>
that
result
satisfy
me
that
my
view
be
the
right
one
.
<EOS>
if
your
ladyship
and
Mr.
Betteredge
persist
in
not
agree
with
me
,
you
must
be
blind
to
what
happen
before
you
this
very
day
.
<EOS>
in
your
hearing
,
I
tell
the
young
lady
that
her
leave
the
house
(
as
thing
be
then
)
would
put
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
my
recover
her
jewel
.
<EOS>
You
see
yourselves
that
she
drive
off
in
the
face
of
that
statement
.
<EOS>
You
see
yourself
that
,
so
far
from
forgive
Mr.
Blake
for
have
do
more
than
all
the
rest
of
you
to
put
the
clue
into
my
hand
,
she
publicly
insult
Mr.
Blake
,
on
the
step
of
her
mother
's
house
.
<EOS>
what
do
these
thing
mean
?
<EOS>
if
Miss
Verinder
be
not
privy
to
the
suppression
of
the
Diamond
,
what
do
these
thing
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
time
he
look
my
way
.
<EOS>
It
be
downright
frightful
to
hear
him
pile
up
proof
after
proof
against
Miss
Rachel
,
and
to
know
,
while
one
be
long
to
defend
her
,
that
there
be
no
dispute
the
truth
of
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
I
be
(
thank
God
!
)
<EOS>
constitutionally
superior
to
reason
.
<EOS>
this
enable
me
to
hold
firm
to
my
lady
's
view
,
which
be
my
view
also
.
<EOS>
this
rouse
my
spirit
,
and
make
me
put
a
bold
face
on
it
before
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
profit
,
good
friend
,
I
beseech
you
,
by
my
example
.
<EOS>
It
will
save
you
from
many
trouble
of
the
vexing
sort
.
<EOS>
cultivate
a
superiority
to
reason
,
and
see
how
you
pare
the
claws
of
all
the
sensible
people
when
they
try
to
scratch
you
for
your
own
good
!
  
<EOS>
find
that
I
make
no
remark
,
and
that
my
mistress
make
no
remark
,
Sergeant
Cuff
proceed
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
it
do
enrage
me
to
notice
that
he
be
not
in
the
least
put
out
by
our
silence
!
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
the
case
,
my
lady
,
as
it
stand
against
Miss
Verinder
alone
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
the
next
thing
be
to
put
the
case
as
it
stand
against
Miss
Verinder
and
the
deceased
Rosanna
Spearman
take
together
.
<EOS>
We
will
go
back
for
a
moment
,
if
you
please
,
to
your
daughter
's
refusal
to
let
her
wardrobe
be
examine
.
<EOS>
My
mind
be
make
up
,
after
that
circumstance
,
I
have
two
question
to
consider
next
.
<EOS>
first
,
as
to
the
right
method
of
conduct
my
inquiry
.
<EOS>
second
,
as
to
whether
Miss
Verinder
have
an
accomplice
among
the
female
servant
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
after
carefully
think
it
over
,
I
determine
to
conduct
the
inquiry
in
,
what
we
should
call
at
our
office
,
a
highly
irregular
manner
.
<EOS>
for
this
reason
:
I
have
a
family
scandal
to
deal
with
,
which
it
be
my
business
to
keep
within
the
family
limit
.
<EOS>
the
less
noise
make
,
and
the
few
stranger
employ
to
help
me
,
the
well
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
usual
course
of
take
people
in
custody
on
suspicion
,
go
before
the
magistrate
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
 
<EOS>
nothing
of
the
sort
be
to
be
think
of
,
when
your
ladyship
's
daughter
be
(
as
I
believe
)
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
business
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
,
I
feel
that
a
person
of
Mr.
Betteredge
's
character
and
position
in
the
house
 
know
the
servant
as
he
do
,
and
have
the
honour
of
the
family
at
heart
 
would
be
safe
to
take
as
an
assistant
than
any
other
person
whom
I
could
lay
my
hand
on
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
try
Mr.
Blake
as
well
 
<EOS>
but
for
one
obstacle
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
he
see
the
drift
of
my
proceeding
at
a
very
early
date
;
and
,
with
his
interest
in
Miss
Verinder
,
any
mutual
understanding
be
impossible
between
him
and
me
.
<EOS>
I
trouble
your
ladyship
with
these
particular
to
show
you
that
I
have
keep
the
family
secret
within
the
family
circle
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
only
outsider
who
know
it
 
and
my
professional
existence
depend
on
hold
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
I
feel
that
my
professional
existence
depend
on
not
hold
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
to
be
hold
up
before
my
mistress
,
in
my
old
age
,
as
a
sort
of
deputy
-
policeman
,
be
,
once
again
,
more
than
my
Christianity
be
strong
enough
to
bear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
to
inform
your
ladyship
,
"
I
say
,
"
that
I
never
,
to
my
knowledge
,
help
this
abominable
detective
business
,
in
any
way
,
from
first
to
last
;
and
I
summon
Sergeant
Cuff
to
contradict
me
,
if
he
dare
!
"
  
<EOS>
have
give
vent
in
those
word
,
I
feel
greatly
relieved
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
honour
me
by
a
little
friendly
pat
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
I
look
with
righteous
indignation
at
the
Sergeant
,
to
see
what
he
think
of
such
a
testimony
as
that
.
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
look
back
like
a
lamb
,
and
seem
to
like
me
better
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
inform
him
that
he
may
continue
his
statement
.
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
she
say
,
"
that
you
have
honestly
do
your
good
,
in
what
you
believe
to
be
my
interest
.
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
have
to
say
next
,
"
answer
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
relate
to
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
I
recognise
the
young
woman
,
as
your
ladyship
may
remember
,
when
she
bring
the
washing
-
book
into
this
room
.
<EOS>
up
to
that
time
I
be
inclined
to
doubt
whether
Miss
Verinder
have
trust
her
secret
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
when
I
see
Rosanna
,
I
alter
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
her
at
once
of
be
privy
to
the
suppression
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
the
poor
creature
have
meet
her
death
by
a
dreadful
end
,
and
I
do
not
want
your
ladyship
to
think
,
now
she
be
go
,
that
I
be
unduly
hard
on
her
.
<EOS>
if
this
have
be
a
common
case
of
thieving
,
I
should
have
give
Rosanna
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
just
as
freely
as
I
should
have
give
it
to
any
of
the
other
servant
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Our
experience
of
the
reformatory
woman
be
,
that
when
try
in
service
 
and
when
kindly
and
judiciously
treat
 
they
prove
themselves
in
the
majority
of
case
to
be
honestly
penitent
,
and
honestly
worthy
of
the
pain
take
with
them
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
a
common
case
of
thieving
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
case
 
in
my
mind
 
of
a
deeply
plan
fraud
,
with
the
owner
of
the
Diamond
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
hold
this
view
,
the
first
consideration
which
naturally
present
itself
to
me
,
in
connection
with
Rosanna
,
be
this
:
Would
miss
Verinder
be
satisfied
(
beg
your
ladyship
's
pardon
)
with
lead
us
all
to
think
that
the
Moonstone
be
merely
lose
?
<EOS>
or
would
she
go
a
step
further
,
and
delude
us
into
believe
that
the
Moonstone
be
steal
?
<EOS>
in
the
latter
event
there
be
Rosanna
Spearman
 
with
the
character
of
a
thief
 
ready
to
her
hand
;
the
person
of
all
other
to
lead
your
ladyship
off
,
and
to
lead
me
off
,
on
a
false
scent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
be
it
possible
<EOS>
(
I
ask
myself
)
that
he
could
put
his
case
against
Miss
Rachel
and
Rosanna
in
a
more
horrid
point
of
view
than
this
?
<EOS>
It
be
possible
,
as
you
shall
now
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
another
reason
for
suspect
the
deceased
woman
,
"
he
say
,
"
which
appear
to
me
to
have
be
strong
still
.
<EOS>
who
would
be
the
very
person
to
help
miss
Verinder
in
raise
money
privately
on
the
Diamond
?
<EOS>
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
no
young
lady
in
Miss
Verinder
's
position
could
manage
such
a
risky
matter
as
that
by
herself
.
<EOS>
a
go
-
between
she
must
have
,
and
who
so
fit
,
I
ask
again
,
as
Rosanna
Spearman
?
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
's
deceased
housemaid
be
at
the
top
of
her
profession
when
she
be
a
thief
.
<EOS>
She
have
relation
,
to
my
certain
knowledge
,
with
one
of
the
few
man
in
London
(
in
the
money
-
lending
line
)
who
would
advance
a
large
sum
on
such
a
notable
jewel
as
the
Moonstone
,
without
ask
awkward
question
,
or
insist
on
awkward
condition
.
<EOS>
bear
this
in
mind
,
my
lady
;
and
now
let
me
show
you
how
my
suspicion
have
be
justify
by
Rosanna
's
own
act
,
and
by
the
plain
inference
to
be
draw
from
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
thereupon
pass
the
whole
of
Rosanna
's
proceeding
under
review
.
<EOS>
You
be
already
as
well
acquaint
with
those
proceeding
as
I
be
;
and
you
will
understand
how
unanswerably
this
part
of
his
report
fix
the
guilt
of
be
concern
in
the
disappearance
of
the
Moonstone
on
the
memory
of
the
poor
dead
girl
.
<EOS>
even
my
mistress
be
daunt
by
what
he
say
now
.
<EOS>
She
make
him
no
answer
when
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
seem
to
matter
to
the
Sergeant
whether
he
be
answer
or
not
.
<EOS>
on
he
go
(
devil
take
him
!
)
,
just
as
steady
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
state
the
whole
case
as
I
understand
it
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
have
only
to
tell
your
ladyship
,
now
,
what
I
propose
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
I
see
two
way
of
bring
this
inquiry
successfully
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
one
of
those
way
I
look
upon
as
a
certainty
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
I
admit
,
be
a
bold
experiment
,
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
shall
decide
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
take
the
certainty
first
?
"
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
make
him
a
sign
to
take
his
own
way
,
and
choose
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
begin
with
the
certainty
,
as
your
ladyship
be
so
good
as
to
leave
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
whether
Miss
Verinder
remain
at
Frizinghall
,
or
whether
she
return
here
,
I
propose
,
in
either
case
,
to
keep
a
careful
watch
on
all
her
proceeding
 
on
the
people
she
see
,
on
the
ride
and
walk
she
may
take
,
and
on
the
letter
she
may
write
and
receive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
next
?
"
ask
my
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
next
,
"
answer
the
Sergeant
,
"
request
your
ladyship
's
leave
to
introduce
into
the
house
,
as
a
servant
in
the
place
of
Rosanna
Spearman
,
a
woman
accustom
to
private
inquiry
of
this
sort
,
for
whose
discretion
I
can
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
next
?
"
repeat
my
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Next
,
"
proceed
the
Sergeant
,
"
and
last
<EOS>
,
I
propose
to
send
one
of
my
brother
-
officer
to
make
an
arrangement
with
that
money
-
lender
in
London
,
whom
I
mention
just
now
as
formerly
acquaint
with
Rosanna
Spearman
 
and
whose
name
and
address
,
your
ladyship
may
rely
on
it
,
have
be
communicate
by
Rosanna
to
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
deny
that
the
course
of
action
I
be
now
suggest
will
cost
money
,
and
consume
time
.
<EOS>
but
the
result
be
certain
.
<EOS>
We
run
a
line
round
the
Moonstone
,
and
we
draw
that
line
closer
and
closer
till
we
find
it
in
Miss
Verinder
's
possession
,
supposing
she
decide
to
keep
it
.
<EOS>
if
her
debt
press
,
and
she
decide
on
send
it
away
,
then
we
have
our
man
ready
,
and
we
meet
the
Moonstone
on
its
arrival
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
to
hear
her
own
daughter
make
the
subject
of
such
a
proposal
as
this
,
sting
my
mistress
into
speak
angrily
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
consider
your
proposal
decline
,
in
every
particular
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
go
on
to
your
other
way
of
bring
the
inquiry
to
an
end
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
other
way
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
go
on
as
easy
as
ever
,
"
be
to
try
that
bold
experiment
to
which
I
have
allude
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
form
a
pretty
correct
estimate
of
Miss
Verinder
's
temperament
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
capable
(
accord
to
my
belief
)
of
commit
a
daring
fraud
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
too
hot
and
impetuous
in
temper
,
and
too
little
accustomed
to
deceit
as
a
habit
,
to
act
the
hypocrite
in
small
thing
,
and
to
restrain
herself
under
all
provocation
.
<EOS>
Her
feeling
,
in
this
case
,
have
repeatedly
get
beyond
her
control
,
at
the
very
time
when
it
be
plainly
her
interest
to
conceal
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
peculiarity
in
her
character
that
I
now
propose
to
act
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
give
her
a
great
shock
suddenly
,
under
circumstance
that
will
touch
her
to
the
quick
.
<EOS>
in
plain
English
,
I
want
to
tell
Miss
Verinder
,
without
a
word
of
warning
,
of
Rosanna
's
death
 
on
the
chance
that
her
own
well
feeling
will
hurry
her
into
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
.
<EOS>
do
your
ladyship
accept
that
alternative
?
"
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
astonish
me
beyond
all
power
of
expression
.
<EOS>
She
answer
him
on
the
instant
:
  
"
yes
;
I
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
pony
-
chaise
be
ready

the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
your
ladyship
good
morning

"
  
<EOS>
My
lady
hold
up
her
hand
,
and
stop
him
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
's
well
feeling
shall
be
appeal
to
,
as
you
propose
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
claim
the
right
,
as
her
mother
,
of
put
her
to
the
test
myself
.
<EOS>
You
will
remain
here
,
if
you
please
;
and
I
will
go
to
Frizinghall
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
once
in
his
life
,
the
great
Cuff
stand
speechless
with
amazement
,
like
an
ordinary
man
.
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
ring
the
bell
,
and
order
her
water
-
proof
thing
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
pour
with
rain
;
and
the
close
carriage
have
go
,
as
you
know
,
with
Miss
Rachel
to
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
dissuade
her
ladyship
from
face
the
severity
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
quite
useless
!
<EOS>
I
ask
leave
to
go
with
her
,
and
hold
the
umbrella
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
pony
-
chaise
come
round
,
with
the
groom
in
charge
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
rely
on
two
thing
,
"
she
say
to
Sergeant
Cuff
,
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
the
experiment
on
Miss
Verinder
as
boldly
as
you
could
try
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
and
I
will
inform
you
of
the
result
,
either
personally
or
by
letter
,
before
the
last
train
leave
for
London
to
-
night
.

"
  
<EOS>
with
that
,
she
step
into
the
chaise
,
and
,
take
the
rein
herself
,
drive
off
to
Frizinghall
.
    
<EOS>
My
mistress
have
leave
us
,
I
have
leisure
to
think
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
sit
in
a
snug
corner
of
the
hall
,
consult
his
memorandum
book
,
and
curl
up
viciously
at
the
corner
of
the
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
make
note
of
the
case
?
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
look
to
see
what
my
next
professional
engagement
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
think
it
be
all
over
then
,
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
answer
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
that
Lady
Verinder
be
one
of
the
clever
woman
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
also
think
a
rose
much
better
worth
look
at
than
a
diamond
.
<EOS>
where
be
the
gardener
,
Mr.
Betteredge
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
get
a
word
more
out
of
him
on
the
matter
of
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
He
have
lose
all
interest
in
his
own
inquiry
;
and
he
would
persist
in
look
for
the
gardener
.
<EOS>
an
hour
afterwards
,
I
hear
them
at
high
word
in
the
conservatory
,
with
the
dog
-
rise
once
more
at
the
bottom
of
the
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
it
be
my
business
to
find
out
whether
Mr.
Franklin
persist
in
his
resolution
to
leave
us
by
the
afternoon
train
.
<EOS>
after
have
be
inform
of
the
conference
in
my
lady
's
room
,
and
of
how
it
have
end
,
he
immediately
decide
on
wait
to
hear
the
news
from
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
this
very
natural
alteration
in
his
plan
 
<EOS>
which
,
with
ordinary
people
,
would
have
lead
to
nothing
in
particular
 
prove
,
in
Mr.
Franklin
's
case
,
to
have
one
objectionable
result
.
<EOS>
It
leave
him
unsettle
,
with
a
legacy
of
idle
time
on
his
hand
,
and
,
in
so
do
,
it
let
out
all
the
foreign
side
of
his
character
,
one
on
the
top
of
another
,
like
rat
out
of
a
bag
.
  
<EOS>
now
as
an
Italian
-
Englishman
,
now
as
a
German
-
Englishman
,
and
now
as
a
French
-
Englishman
,
he
drift
in
and
out
of
all
the
sitting
-
room
in
the
house
,
with
nothing
to
talk
of
<EOS>
but
Miss
Rachel
's
treatment
of
him
;
and
with
nobody
to
address
himself
to
<EOS>
but
me
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
(
for
example
)
in
the
library
,
sit
under
the
map
of
Modern
Italy
,
and
quite
unaware
of
any
other
method
of
meet
his
trouble
,
except
the
method
of
talk
about
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
several
worthy
aspiration
,
Betteredge
;
but
what
be
I
to
do
with
them
now
?
<EOS>
I
be
full
of
dormant
good
quality
,
if
Rachel
would
only
have
help
me
to
bring
them
out
!
"
<EOS>
He
be
so
eloquent
in
draw
the
picture
of
his
own
neglect
merit
,
and
so
pathetic
in
lament
over
it
when
it
be
do
,
that
I
feel
quite
at
my
wit
'
end
how
to
console
him
,
when
it
suddenly
occur
to
me
that
here
be
a
case
for
the
wholesome
application
of
a
bit
of
ROBINSON
crusoe
.
<EOS>
I
hobble
out
to
my
own
room
,
and
hobble
back
with
that
immortal
book
.
<EOS>
nobody
in
the
library
!
<EOS>
the
map
of
Modern
Italy
stare
at
me
;
and
I
stare
at
the
map
of
Modern
Italy
.
  
<EOS>
I
try
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
there
be
his
handkerchief
on
the
floor
,
to
prove
that
he
have
drift
in
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
the
empty
room
to
prove
that
he
have
drift
out
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
try
the
dining
-
room
,
and
discover
Samuel
with
a
biscuit
and
a
glass
of
sherry
,
silently
investigate
the
empty
air
.
<EOS>
a
minute
since
,
Mr.
Franklin
have
ring
furiously
for
a
little
light
refreshment
.
<EOS>
on
its
production
,
in
a
violent
hurry
,
by
Samuel
,
Mr.
Franklin
have
vanish
before
the
bell
downstairs
have
quite
do
ringing
with
the
pull
he
have
give
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
try
the
morning
-
room
,
and
find
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
there
he
be
at
the
window
,
draw
hieroglyphic
with
his
finger
in
the
damp
on
the
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sherry
be
wait
for
you
,
sir
,
"
I
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
have
address
myself
to
one
of
the
four
wall
of
the
room
;
he
be
down
in
the
bottomless
deep
of
his
own
meditation
,
past
all
pull
up
.
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
explain
Rachel
's
conduct
,
Betteredge
?
"
<EOS>
be
the
only
answer
I
receive
.
<EOS>
not
be
ready
with
the
needful
reply
,
I
produce
ROBINSON
crusoe
,
in
which
I
be
firmly
persuade
some
explanation
may
have
be
find
,
if
we
have
only
search
long
enough
for
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
shut
up
ROBINSON
crusoe
,
and
flounder
into
his
german
-
english
gibberish
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
"
why
not
look
into
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
as
if
I
have
personally
object
to
look
into
it
.
<EOS>
"
why
the
devil
lose
your
patience
,
Betteredge
,
when
patience
be
all
that
be
want
to
arrive
at
the
truth
?
<EOS>
do
not
interrupt
me
.
<EOS>
Rachel
's
conduct
be
perfectly
intelligible
,
if
you
will
only
do
her
the
common
justice
to
take
the
objective
view
first
,
and
the
subjective
view
next
,
and
the
objective
-
subjective
view
to
wind
up
with
.
<EOS>
what
do
we
know
?
<EOS>
We
know
that
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
,
on
Thursday
morning
last
,
throw
her
into
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
,
from
which
she
have
not
recover
yet
.
<EOS>
do
you
mean
to
deny
the
objective
view
,
so
far
?
<EOS>
very
well
,
then
 
do
not
interrupt
me
.
<EOS>
now
,
be
in
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
,
how
be
we
to
expect
that
she
should
behave
as
she
may
otherwise
have
behave
to
any
of
the
people
about
her
?
<EOS>
argue
in
this
way
,
from
within
-
outward
,
what
do
we
reach
?
<EOS>
We
reach
the
subjective
view
.
<EOS>
I
defy
you
to
controvert
the
subjective
view
.
<EOS>
very
well
then
 
what
follow
?
<EOS>
good
Heavens
!
<EOS>
the
objective
-
subjective
explanation
follow
,
of
course
!
<EOS>
Rachel
,
properly
speak
,
be
not
Rachel
,
but
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
do
I
mind
be
cruelly
treat
by
somebody
else
?
<EOS>
You
be
unreasonable
enough
,
Betteredge
;
but
you
can
hardly
accuse
me
of
that
.
<EOS>
then
how
do
it
end
?
<EOS>
It
end
,
in
spite
of
your
confound
english
narrowness
and
prejudice
,
in
my
be
perfectly
happy
and
comfortable
.
<EOS>
where
be
the
sherry
?
"
  
<EOS>
My
head
be
by
this
time
in
such
a
condition
,
that
I
be
not
quite
sure
whether
it
be
my
own
head
,
or
Mr.
Franklin
's
.
<EOS>
in
this
deplorable
state
,
I
contrive
to
do
,
what
I
take
to
have
be
,
three
objective
thing
.
<EOS>
I
get
Mr.
Franklin
his
sherry
;
I
retire
to
my
own
room
;
and
I
solace
myself
with
the
most
composing
pipe
of
tobacco
I
ever
remember
to
have
smoke
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
do
not
suppose
,
however
,
that
I
be
quit
of
Mr.
Franklin
on
such
easy
term
as
these
.
<EOS>
drift
again
,
out
of
the
morning
-
room
into
the
hall
,
he
find
his
way
to
the
office
next
,
smelt
my
pipe
,
and
be
instantly
remind
that
he
have
be
simple
enough
to
give
up
smoking
for
Miss
Rachel
's
sake
.
<EOS>
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
he
burst
in
on
me
with
his
cigar
-
case
,
and
come
out
strong
on
the
one
everlasting
subject
,
in
his
neat
,
witty
,
unbelieving
,
french
way
.
"
<EOS>
give
me
a
light
,
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
be
it
conceivable
that
a
man
can
have
smoke
as
long
as
I
have
without
discover
that
there
be
a
complete
system
for
the
treatment
of
woman
at
the
bottom
of
his
cigar
-
case
?
<EOS>
follow
me
carefully
,
and
I
will
prove
it
in
two
word
.
<EOS>
You
choose
a
cigar
,
you
try
it
,
and
it
disappoint
you
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
do
upon
that
?
<EOS>
You
throw
it
away
and
try
another
.
<EOS>
now
observe
the
application
!
<EOS>
You
choose
a
woman
,
you
try
her
,
and
she
break
your
heart
.
<EOS>
fool
!
<EOS>
take
a
lesson
from
your
cigar
-
case
.
<EOS>
throw
her
away
,
and
try
another
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
at
that
.
<EOS>
wonderfully
clever
,
I
dare
say
,
but
my
own
experience
be
dead
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
the
time
of
the
late
Mrs.
Betteredge
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
feel
pretty
often
inclined
to
try
your
philosophy
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
but
the
law
insist
on
your
smoking
your
cigar
,
sir
,
when
you
have
once
choose
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
point
that
observation
with
a
wink
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
burst
out
laugh
 
<EOS>
and
we
be
as
merry
as
cricket
,
until
the
next
new
side
of
his
character
turn
up
in
due
course
.
<EOS>
so
thing
go
on
with
my
young
master
and
me
;
and
so
(
while
the
Sergeant
and
the
gardener
be
wrangle
over
the
rose
)
<EOS>
we
two
spend
the
interval
before
the
news
come
back
from
Frizinghall
.
  
<EOS>
the
pony
-
chaise
return
a
good
half
hour
before
I
have
venture
to
expect
it
.
<EOS>
My
lady
have
decide
to
remain
for
the
present
,
at
her
sister
's
house
.
<EOS>
the
groom
bring
two
letter
from
his
mistress
;
one
address
to
Mr.
Franklin
,
and
the
other
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
's
letter
I
send
to
him
in
the
library
 
into
which
refuge
his
drifting
have
now
take
him
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
My
own
letter
,
I
read
in
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
a
cheque
,
which
drop
out
when
I
open
it
,
inform
me
(
before
I
have
master
the
content
)
that
Sergeant
Cuff
's
dismissal
from
the
inquiry
after
the
Moonstone
be
now
a
settle
thing
.
  
<EOS>
I
send
to
the
conservatory
to
say
that
I
wish
to
speak
to
the
Sergeant
directly
.
<EOS>
He
appear
,
with
his
mind
full
of
the
gardener
and
the
dog
-
rose
,
declare
that
the
equal
of
Mr.
Begbie
for
obstinacy
never
have
exist
yet
,
and
never
would
exist
again
.
<EOS>
I
request
him
to
dismiss
such
wretched
trifling
as
this
from
our
conversation
,
and
to
give
his
good
attention
to
a
really
serious
matter
.
<EOS>
upon
that
he
exert
himself
sufficiently
to
notice
the
letter
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
in
a
weary
way
,
"
you
have
hear
from
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
have
I
anything
to
do
with
it
,
Mr.
Betteredge
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
judge
for
yourself
,
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
thereupon
read
him
the
letter
(
with
my
good
emphasis
and
discretion
)
<EOS>
,
in
the
follow
word
:
  
"
my
GOOD
GABRIEL
,
 
I
request
that
you
will
inform
Sergeant
Cuff
,
that
I
have
perform
the
promise
I
make
to
him
;
with
this
result
,
so
far
as
Rosanna
Spearman
be
concern
.
<EOS>
miss
Verinder
solemnly
declare
,
that
she
have
never
speak
a
word
in
private
to
Rosanna
,
since
that
unhappy
woman
first
enter
my
house
.
<EOS>
They
never
meet
,
even
accidentally
,
on
the
night
when
the
Diamond
be
lose
;
and
no
communication
of
any
sort
whatever
take
place
between
them
,
from
the
Thursday
morning
when
the
alarm
be
first
raise
in
the
house
,
to
this
present
Saturday
afternoon
,
when
Miss
Verinder
leave
us
.
<EOS>
after
tell
my
daughter
suddenly
,
and
in
so
many
word
,
of
Rosanna
Spearman
's
suicide
 
this
be
what
have
come
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
have
reach
that
point
,
I
look
up
,
and
ask
Sergeant
Cuff
what
he
think
of
the
letter
,
so
far
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
only
offend
you
if
I
express
my
opinion
,
"
answer
the
Sergeant
.
"
<EOS>
go
on
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
say
,
with
the
most
exasperating
resignation
,
"
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
I
remember
that
this
man
have
have
the
audacity
to
complain
of
our
gardener
's
obstinacy
,
my
tongue
itch
to
"
go
on
"
in
other
word
than
my
mistress
's
.
<EOS>
this
time
,
however
,
my
Christianity
hold
firm
.
<EOS>
I
proceed
steadily
with
her
ladyship
's
letter
:
  
"
have
appeal
to
Miss
Verinder
in
the
manner
which
the
officer
think
most
desirable
,
I
speak
to
her
next
in
the
manner
which
I
myself
think
most
likely
to
impress
her
.
<EOS>
on
two
different
occasion
,
before
my
daughter
leave
my
roof
,
I
privately
warn
her
that
she
be
expose
herself
to
suspicion
of
the
most
unendurable
and
most
degrading
kind
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
tell
her
,
in
the
plain
term
,
that
my
apprehension
have
be
realise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
answer
to
this
,
on
her
own
solemn
affirmation
,
be
as
plain
as
word
can
be
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
she
owe
no
money
privately
to
any
live
creature
.
<EOS>
in
the
second
place
,
the
Diamond
be
not
now
,
and
never
have
be
,
in
her
possession
,
since
she
put
it
into
her
cabinet
on
Wednesday
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
confidence
which
my
daughter
have
place
in
me
go
no
further
than
this
.
<EOS>
She
maintain
an
obstinate
silence
,
when
I
ask
her
if
she
can
explain
the
disappearance
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
She
refuse
,
with
tear
,
when
I
appeal
to
her
to
speak
out
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
"
the
day
will
come
when
you
will
know
why
I
be
careless
about
be
suspect
,
and
why
I
be
silent
even
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
much
to
make
my
mother
pity
me
 
nothing
to
make
my
mother
blush
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
those
be
my
daughter
's
own
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
what
have
pass
between
the
officer
and
me
,
I
think
 
stranger
as
he
be
 
that
he
should
be
make
acquainted
with
what
Miss
Verinder
have
say
,
as
well
as
you
.
<EOS>
read
my
letter
to
him
,
and
then
place
in
his
hand
the
cheque
which
I
enclose
.
<EOS>
in
resign
all
further
claim
on
his
service
,
I
have
only
to
say
that
I
be
convince
of
his
honesty
and
his
intelligence
;
but
I
be
more
firmly
persuade
than
ever
,
that
the
circumstance
,
in
this
case
,
have
fatally
mislead
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
the
letter
end
.
<EOS>
before
present
the
cheque
,
I
ask
Sergeant
Cuff
if
he
have
any
remark
to
make
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
part
of
my
duty
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
he
answer
,
"
to
make
remark
on
a
case
,
when
I
have
do
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
toss
the
cheque
across
the
table
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
believe
in
that
part
of
her
ladyship
's
letter
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
look
at
the
cheque
,
and
lift
up
his
dismal
eyebrow
in
acknowledgment
of
her
ladyship
's
liberality
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
such
a
generous
estimate
of
the
value
of
my
time
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
I
feel
bound
to
make
some
return
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
bear
in
mind
the
amount
in
this
cheque
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
when
the
occasion
come
round
for
remember
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
ladyship
have
smooth
matter
over
for
the
present
very
cleverly
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
this
family
scandal
be
of
the
sort
that
burst
up
again
when
you
least
expect
it
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
more
detective
-
business
on
our
hand
,
sir
,
before
the
Moonstone
be
many
month
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
those
word
mean
anything
,
and
if
the
manner
in
which
he
speak
them
mean
anything
 
it
come
to
this
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
's
letter
have
prove
,
to
his
mind
,
that
Miss
Rachel
be
harden
enough
to
resist
the
strong
appeal
that
could
be
address
to
her
,
and
that
she
have
deceive
her
own
mother
(
good
God
,
under
what
circumstance
!
)
<EOS>
by
a
series
of
abominable
lie
.
<EOS>
how
other
people
,
in
my
place
,
may
have
reply
to
the
Sergeant
,
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
answer
what
he
say
in
these
plain
term
:
  
"
Sergeant
Cuff
,
I
consider
your
last
observation
as
an
insult
to
my
lady
and
her
daughter
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
consider
it
as
a
warning
to
yourself
,
and
you
will
be
nearer
the
mark
.
"
  
<EOS>
hot
and
angry
as
I
be
,
the
infernal
confidence
with
which
he
give
me
that
answer
close
my
lip
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
to
the
window
to
compose
myself
.
<EOS>
the
rain
have
give
over
;
and
,
who
should
I
see
in
the
court
-
yard
,
but
Mr.
Begbie
,
the
gardener
,
wait
outside
to
continue
the
dog
-
rise
controversy
with
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
compliment
to
the
Sairgent
,
"
say
Mr.
Begbie
,
the
moment
he
set
eye
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
minded
to
walk
to
the
station
,
I
be
agreeable
to
go
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
cry
the
Sergeant
,
behind
me
,
"
be
you
not
convince
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
de'il
<EOS>
a
bit
I
be
convinced
!
"
answer
Mr.
Begbie
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
walk
to
the
station
!
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
meet
you
at
the
gate
!
"
say
Mr.
Begbie
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
angry
enough
,
as
you
know
 
<EOS>
but
how
be
any
man
's
anger
to
hold
out
against
such
an
interruption
as
this
?
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
notice
the
change
in
me
,
and
encourage
it
by
a
word
in
season
.
<EOS>
"
come
!
<EOS>
come
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
"
why
not
treat
my
view
of
the
case
as
her
ladyship
treat
it
?
<EOS>
why
not
say
,
the
circumstance
have
fatally
mislead
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
to
take
anything
as
her
ladyship
take
it
be
a
privilege
worth
enjoy
 
even
with
the
disadvantage
of
its
have
be
offer
to
me
by
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
I
cool
slowly
down
to
my
customary
level
.
<EOS>
I
regard
any
other
opinion
of
Miss
Rachel
,
than
my
lady
's
opinion
or
mine
,
with
a
lofty
contempt
.
<EOS>
the
only
thing
I
could
not
do
,
be
to
keep
off
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
!
<EOS>
My
own
good
sense
ought
to
have
warn
me
,
I
know
,
to
let
the
matter
rest
 
<EOS>
but
,
there
!
<EOS>
the
virtue
which
distinguish
the
present
generation
be
not
invent
in
my
time
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
have
hit
me
on
the
raw
,
and
,
though
I
do
look
down
upon
him
with
contempt
,
the
tender
place
still
tingle
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
the
end
of
it
be
that
I
perversely
lead
him
back
to
the
subject
of
her
ladyship
's
letter
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
satisfied
myself
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
never
mind
that
!
<EOS>
go
on
,
as
if
I
be
still
open
to
conviction
.
<EOS>
You
think
Miss
Rachel
be
not
to
be
believe
on
her
word
;
and
you
say
we
shall
hear
of
the
Moonstone
again
.
<EOS>
back
your
opinion
,
Sergeant
,
"
I
conclude
,
in
an
airy
way
.
<EOS>
"
back
your
opinion
.
"
  
<EOS>
instead
of
take
offence
,
Sergeant
Cuff
seize
my
hand
,
and
shake
it
till
my
finger
ache
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
to
heaven
,
"
say
this
strange
officer
solemnly
,
"
I
would
take
to
domestic
service
to
-
morrow
,
Mr.
Betteredge
,
if
I
have
a
chance
of
be
employ
along
with
You
!
<EOS>
to
say
you
be
as
transparent
as
a
child
,
sir
,
be
to
pay
the
child
a
compliment
which
nine
out
of
ten
of
them
do
not
deserve
.
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
we
will
not
begin
to
dispute
again
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
it
out
of
me
on
easy
term
than
that
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
a
word
more
about
her
ladyship
,
or
about
Miss
Verinder
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
turn
prophet
,
for
once
in
a
way
,
and
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
I
have
warn
you
already
that
you
have
not
do
with
the
Moonstone
yet
.
<EOS>
very
well
.
<EOS>
now
I
will
tell
you
,
at
parting
,
of
three
thing
which
will
happen
in
the
future
,
and
which
,
I
believe
,
will
force
themselves
on
your
attention
,
whether
you
like
it
or
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
go
on
!
"
I
say
,
quite
unabashed
,
and
just
as
airy
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
first
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
"
you
will
hear
something
from
the
Yollands
 
when
the
postman
deliver
Rosanna
's
letter
at
Cobb
's
Hole
,
on
Monday
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
he
have
throw
a
bucket
of
cold
water
over
me
,
I
doubt
if
I
could
have
feel
it
much
more
unpleasantly
than
I
feel
those
word
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
's
assertion
of
her
innocence
have
leave
Rosanna
's
conduct
 
<EOS>
the
making
the
new
nightgown
,
the
hiding
the
smear
nightgown
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
 
entirely
without
explanation
.

and
this
have
never
occur
to
me
,
till
Sergeant
Cuff
force
it
on
my
mind
all
in
a
moment
!
  
<EOS>

second
place

Sergeant

you
will
hear
of
the
three
Indians

You
will
hear
of
them

neighbourhood

Rachel
remain
in

London

lose
all
interest
in
the
three
juggler

have
thoroughly
convince
myself
of
my
young
lady
's
innocence

I
take
this
second
prophecy
easily
enough
.
"
<EOS>
so
much
for
two
of

three

eager

the
controversy

gate

Sergeant

my
hand

dart
out
into
the
court

yard

hotter
still
on

side

him
about

I
may
as
well
(
as
the
Irish
say
)
have
whistle
jig
to
a
milestone

away
they
go
together
,
fight
the
battle
of
the
rose

last
I

get
him
by

arm

well

<EOS>
well

report
Mr.
Franklin

departure

the
history
of
the
Saturday
's
event
will
be
finish
at
last

and
when
I
have
next
describe
certain
strange
thing
that
happen
in
the
course
of
the
new
week
,
I
shall
have
do
my
part
of
the
Story

shall
hand
over
the
pen

the
person

follow
my
lead

Lord
,
how
we
shall
enjoy
ourselves
on
both
side
a
few
page
further
on
!
    
<EOS>
I
have
keep
the
pony
chaise
ready
,
in
case
Mr.
Franklin
persist
in
leave
us
by
the
train
that
night
.
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
luggage
,
follow
downstairs
by
Mr.
Franklin
himself

inform
me
plainly
enough
that
he
have
hold
firm
to
a
resolution
for
once
in
his
life

<EOS>
"
so
you
have
really
make
up
your
mind
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
as
we
meet
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"
why
not
wait
a
day
or
two
long
,
and
give
Miss
Rachel
another
chance
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
foreign
varnish
appear
to
have
all
wear
off
Mr.
Franklin
,
now
that
the
time
have
come
for
say
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
instead
of
reply
to
me
in
word
,
he
put
the
letter
which
her
ladyship
have
address
to
him
into
my
hand
.
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
it
say
over
again
what
have
be
say
already
in
the
other
communication
receive
by
me
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
bit
about
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
add
at
the
end
,
which
will
account
for
the
steadiness
of
Mr.
Franklin
's
determination
,
if
it
account
for
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
wonder
,
I
dare
say
"
(
her
ladyship
write
)
,
"
at
my
allow
my
own
daughter
to
keep
me
perfectly
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
a
Diamond
worth
twenty
thousand
pound
have
be
lose
 
and
I
be
leave
to
infer
that
the
mystery
of
its
disappearance
be
no
mystery
to
Rachel
,
and
that
some
incomprehensible
obligation
of
silence
have
be
lay
on
her
,
by
some
person
or
person
utterly
unknown
to
me
,
with
some
object
in
view
at
which
I
can
not
even
guess
.
<EOS>
be
it
conceivable
that
I
should
allow
myself
to
be
trifle
with
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
It
be
quite
conceivable
,
in
Rachel
's
present
state
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
condition
of
nervous
agitation
pitiable
to
see
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
approach
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
again
until
time
have
do
something
to
quiet
her
.
<EOS>
to
help
this
end
,
I
have
not
hesitate
to
dismiss
the
police
-
officer
.
<EOS>
the
mystery
which
baffle
us
,
baffle
him
too
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
a
matter
in
which
any
stranger
can
help
us
.
<EOS>
He
add
to
what
I
have
to
suffer
;
and
he
madden
Rachel
if
she
only
hear
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
plan
for
the
future
be
as
well
settle
as
they
can
be
.
<EOS>
My
present
idea
be
to
take
Rachel
to
London
 
partly
to
relieve
her
mind
by
a
complete
change
,
partly
to
try
what
may
be
do
by
consult
the
good
medical
advice
.
<EOS>
Can
I
ask
you
to
meet
us
in
town
?
<EOS>
My
dear
Franklin
,
you
,
in
your
way
,
must
imitate
my
patience
,
and
wait
,
as
I
do
,
for
a
fitter
time
.
<EOS>
the
valuable
assistance
which
you
render
to
the
inquiry
after
the
lost
jewel
be
still
an
unpardoned
offence

dreadful
state

move
blindfold
in
this
matter

you
have
add
to
the
burden
of
anxiety
which
she
have
have
to
bear

by
innocently
threaten
her
secret
with
discovery

through
your
exertion

It
be
impossible
for
me
to
excuse
the
perversity
that
hold
you
responsible
for
consequence
which
neither
you
nor
I
could
imagine

foresee

She
be
not

reason
with
 
she
can
only
be
pity

<EOS>
I
be
grieve
to
have
to
say
it
,
but
for
the
present
,
you
and
Rachel
be
better
apart

the
only
advice
I
can
offer
you

,
to
give
her
time

<EOS>
I
hand
the
letter
back
,
sincerely
sorry
for
Mr.
Franklin
,
for
I
know
how
fond
he
be
of
my
young
lady
;
and
I
see
that
her
mother
's
account
of
her
have
cut
him
to
the
heart

"
You

be
all
I

<EOS>
Mr.

fold
up
his

letter

without
appear
to
be
much
comfort
by
the
remark
which
I
have
venture
on
address
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
come
here
from
London

horrible
Diamond

he

I
do
not
believe
there
be
a
happy
household

England

<EOS>
look
at
the
household
now

<EOS>
scatter
,
disunite
 
the
very
air

the
place
poison
with
mystery

suspicion

<EOS>
do
you
remember
that
morning
at
the
Shivering
Sand

we
talk
about
my
uncle
Herncastle

his
birthday
gift

<EOS>

<EOS>
with
that
he
shake
me
by
the
hand
,
and
go
out
to
the
pony
chaise
.
  
<EOS>
I
follow
him
down
the
step
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
miserable
to
see
him
leave
the
old
place
,
where
he
have
spend
the
happy
year
of
his
life
,
in
this
way

<EOS>
Penelope
(
sadly
upset
by
all
that
have
happen
in

house

come
round
crying
,
to
bid
him
good
-
bye

<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
kiss
her

I
wave
my
hand
as
much
as

,
"
You

welcome

<EOS>
"
some
of
the
other
female
servant
appear
,
peep
after
him
round
the
corner
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
man
whom
the
woman
all
like
.
<EOS>
at
the
last
moment
,
I
stop
the
pony
chaise
,
and
beg
as
a
favour
that
he
would
let
us
hear
from
him
by
letter
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
seem
to
heed
what
I
say
 
he
be
look
round
from
one
thing
to
another
,
take
a
sort
of
farewell
of
the
old
house
and
ground
.
<EOS>
"
tell
us
where
you
be
go
to
,
sir

"
<EOS>
I
say
,
hold
on
by
the
chaise
,
and
try
to
get
at
his
future
plan
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
pull
his
hat
down
suddenly
over
his
eye
.
"
<EOS>
go
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
echo
the
word
after
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
the
devil
!
"
<EOS>
the
pony
start
at
the
word
,
as
if
he
have
feel
a
christian
horror
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
sir
,
go
where
you
may
!
"
be
all
I
have
time
to
say
,
before
he
be
out
of
sight
and
hearing
.
<EOS>
a
sweet
and
pleasant
gentleman
!
<EOS>
with
all
his
fault
and
folly
,
a
sweet
and
pleasant
gentleman
!
<EOS>
He
leave
a
sad
gap
behind
him
,
when
he
leave
my
lady
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
dull
and
dreary
enough
,
when
the
long
summer
evening
close
in
,
on
that
Saturday
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
keep
my
spirit
from
sink
by
stick
fast
to
my
pipe
and
my
ROBINSON
crusoe
.
<EOS>
the
woman
(
except
Penelope
)
beguile
the
time
by
talk
of
Rosanna
's
suicide
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
obstinately
of
opinion
that
the
poor
girl
have
steal
the
Moonstone
,
and
that
she
have
destroy
herself
in
terror
of
be
find
out
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
,
of
course
,
privately
hold
fast
to
what
she
have
say
all
along
.
<EOS>
Her
notion
of
the
motive
which
be
really
at
the
bottom
of
the
suicide
fail
,
oddly
enough
,
just
where
my
young
lady
's
assertion
of
her
innocence
fail
also
.
<EOS>
It
leave
Rosanna
's
secret
journey
to
Frizinghall
,
and
Rosanna
's
proceeding
in
the
matter
of
the
nightgown
entirely
unaccounted
for
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
use
in
point
this
out
to
Penelope
;
the
objection
make
about
as
much
impression
on
her
as
a
shower
of
rain
on
a
waterproof
coat

<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
my
daughter
inherit
my
superiority
to
reason
 
and
,
in
respect
to
that
accomplishment
,
have
get
a
long
way
ahead
of
her

in
my
opinion

the

some
pleasing
quality
in
the
eye
of
a

<EOS>
a
dark

keen

clever

high

She
poise
herself
on

"
LAMBETH
 
shortly
before
the
closing
of

Septimus
Luker
,
the

-
know
dealer
in
ancient
gem
,
carving
,
intagli
,
&
c.
,
&
c.
,
apply
to
the
sit
magistrate
for
advice
.
<EOS>
the
applicant
state
that
he
have
be
annoy
,
at
interval
throughout
the
day
,
by
the
proceeding
of
some
of
those
stroll
Indians
who
infest
the
street
.
<EOS>
the
person
complain
of
be
three
in
number
.
<EOS>
after
have
be
send
away
by
the
police
,
they
have
return
again
and
again
,
and
have
attempt
to
enter
the
house
on
pretence
of
ask
for
charity
.
<EOS>
warn
off
in
the
front
,
they
have
be
discover
again
at
the
back
of
the
premise
.
<EOS>
besides
the
annoyance
complain
of
,
Mr.
Luker
express
himself
as
be
under
some
apprehension
that
robbery
may
be
contemplate
.
<EOS>
His
collection
contain
many
unique
gem
,
both
classical
and
oriental
,
of
the
high
value
.
<EOS>
He
have
only
the
day
before
be
compel
to
dismiss
a
skilled
workman
in
ivory
carve
from
his
employment
(
a
native
of
India
,
as
we
understand
)
,
on
suspicion
of
attempt
theft
;
and
he
feel
by
no
means
sure
that
this
man
and
the
street
juggler
of
whom
he
complain
,
may
not
be
act
in
concert
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
their
object
to
collect
a
crowd
,
and
create
a
disturbance
in
the
street
,
and
,
in
the
confusion
thus
cause
,
to
obtain
access
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
in
reply
to
the
magistrate
,
Mr.
Luker
admit
that
he
have
no
evidence
to
produce
of
any
attempt
at
robbery
be
in
contemplation
.
<EOS>
He
could
speak
positively
to
the
annoyance
and
interruption
cause
by
the
Indians
,
but
not
to
anything
else
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
remark
that
,
if
the
annoyance
be
repeat
,
the
applicant
could
summon
the
Indians
to
that
court
,
where
they
may
easily
be
deal
with
under
the
Act
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
valuable
in
Mr.
Luker
's
possession
,
Mr.
Luker
himself
must
take
the
good
measure
for
their
safe
custody
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
well
perhaps
to
communicate
with
the
police
,
and
to
adopt
such
additional
precaution
as
their
experience
may
suggest
.
<EOS>
the
applicant

his
worship
,
and

We

<EOS>
whatever
opinion
any
of
the

may
express
,
whatever
peculiarity
of
treatment
may
mark
,
and
perhaps
in
a
literary
sense
,
disfigure
the
narrative
which
I
be
now
collect
,
not
a

will
be
tamper

happy
enough
at
the
present
moment
,
not
only
to
brave
the
smart
exercise
of
Miss
Clack
's
pen
,
but
even
to
recognise
its
unquestionable
value
as
an
instrument
for
the
exhibition
of
Miss
Clack
's
character
.

<EOS>
see
the
shutter
open
,
and
the

draw
up

I
feel
that
it
would
be
an
act
of
polite
attention
to
knock
,
and
make
inquiry
.
<EOS>
the
person
who
answer
the

<EOS>
the

in
insolent
silence
,
and

She

a
heathen
old

Betteredge

too

<EOS>
I
sit
down
in

to
wait
for
my

and
,
have
always
a
few
tract
in
my

I
select
one
which
prove

be
quite
providentially
applicable
to
the

<EOS>
the
hall
be
dirty

be
hard
;
but
the
bless
consciousness
of
return
good

me
quite
above
any
trifle
consideration
of
that
kind

<EOS>
the
tract

one
of
a
series
address
to

I
pass
over
the
manner
in
which
she
give
her
message
,
and
the
dreadful
boldness
of
her
look
.
<EOS>
I
thank
this
young
castaway
;
and
I
say
,
in
a
tone
of
christian
interest
,
"

<EOS>
I

bank
.
<EOS>
the
stranger
insist
on
make
Mr.
Godfrey
precede
him
;
Mr.
Godfrey
say
a
few
civil
word
;
they
bow
,
and
part
in
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
thoughtless
and
superficial
people
may
say
,
here
be
surely
a
very
trumpery
little
incident
relate
in
an
absurdly
circumstantial
manner
.
<EOS>
oh
,
my
young
friend
and
fellow
-
sinner
!
<EOS>
beware
of
presuming
to
exercise
your
poor
carnal
reason
.
<EOS>
oh
,
be
morally
tidy
.
<EOS>
let
your
faith
be
as
your
stocking
,
and
your
stocking
as
your
faith
.
<EOS>
both
ever
spotless
,
and
both
ready
to
put
on
at
a
moment
's
notice
!
  
<EOS>
I
beg
a
thousand
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
have
fall
insensibly
into
my
Sunday
-
school
style
.
<EOS>
Most
inappropriate
in
such
a
record
as
this
.
<EOS>
let
me
try
to
be
worldly
 
<EOS>
let
me
say
that
trifle
,
in
this
case
as
in
many
other
,
lead
to
terrible
result
.
<EOS>
merely
premise
that
the
polite
stranger
be
Mr.
Luker
,
of
Lambeth
,
we
will
now
follow
Mr.
Godfrey
home
to
his
residence
at
Kilburn
.
  
<EOS>
He
find
wait
for
him
,
in
the
hall
,
a
poorly
clothe
but
delicate
and
interesting
-
look
little
boy
.
<EOS>
the
boy
hand
him
a
letter
,
merely
mention
that
he
have
be
entrust
with
it
by
an
old
lady
whom
he
do
not
know
,
and
who
have
give
him
no
instruction
to
wait
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
such
incident
as
these
be
not
uncommon
in
Mr.
Godfrey
's
large
experience
as
a
promoter
of
public
charity
.
<EOS>
He
let
the
boy
go
,
and
open
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
the
handwriting
be
entirely
unfamiliar
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
request
his
attendance
,
within
an
hour
's
time
,
at
a
house
in
Northumberland
Street
,
Strand
,
which
he
have
never
have
occasion
to
enter
before
.
<EOS>
the
object
seek
be
to
obtain
from
the
worthy
manager
certain
detail
on
the
subject
of
the
Mothers'-Small
-
Clothes
-
Conversion
-
Society
,
and
the
information
be
want
by
an
elderly
lady
who
propose
add
largely
to
the
resource
of
the
charity
,
if
her
question
be
meet
by
satisfactory
reply
.
<EOS>
She
mention
her
name
,
and
she
add
that
the
shortness
of
her
stay
in
London
prevent
her
from
give
any
long
notice
to
the
eminent
philanthropist
whom
she
address
.
  
<EOS>
ordinary
people
may
have
hesitate
before
set
aside
their
own
engagement
to
suit
the
convenience
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
the
Christian
Hero
never
hesitate
where
good
be
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
instantly
turn
back
,
and
proceed
to
the
house
in
Northumberland
Street
.
<EOS>
a
most
respectable
though
somewhat
corpulent
man
answer
the
door
,
and
,
on
hear
Mr.
Godfrey
's
name
,
immediately
conduct
him
into
an
empty
apartment
at
the
back
,
on
the
drawing
-
room
floor
.
<EOS>
He
notice
two
unusual
thing
on
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
be
a
faint
odour
of
musk
and
camphor
.
<EOS>
the
other
be
an
ancient
oriental
manuscript
,
richly
illuminate
with
indian
figure
and
device
,
that
lie
open
to
inspection
on
a
table
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
look
at
the
book
,
the
position
of
which
cause
him
to
stand
with
his
back
turn
towards
the
close
fold
door
communicate
with
the
front
room
,
when
,
without
the
slight
previous
noise
to
warn
him
,
he
feel
himself
suddenly
seize
round
the
neck
from
behind
.
<EOS>
He
have
just
time
to
notice
that
the
arm
round
his
neck
<EOS>
be
naked
and
of
a
tawny
-
brown
colour
,
before
his
eye
be
bandage
,
his
mouth
be
gag
,
and
he
be
throw
helpless
on
the
floor
by
(
as
he
judge
)
two
man
.
<EOS>
a
third
rifle
his
pocket
,
and
 
if
,
as
a
lady
,
I
may
venture
to
use
such
an
expression
 
<EOS>
search
him
,
without
ceremony
,
through
and
through
to
his
skin
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
should
greatly
enjoy
say
a
few
cheer
word
on
the
devout
confidence
which
could
alone
have
sustain
Mr.
Godfrey
in
an
emergency
so
terrible
as
this
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
however
,
the
position
and
appearance
of
my
admirable
friend
at
the
culminate
period
of
the
outrage
(
as
above
describe
)
be
hardly
within
the
proper
limit
of
female
discussion
.
<EOS>
let
me
pass
over
the
next
few
moment
,
and
return
to
Mr.
Godfrey
at
the
time
when
the
odious
search
of
his
person
have
be
complete
.
<EOS>
the
outrage
have
be
perpetrate
throughout
in
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
it
some
word
be
exchange
,
among
the
invisible
wretch
,
in
a
language
which
he
do
not
understand
,
but
in
tone
which
be
plainly
expressive
(
to
his
cultivated
ear
)
of
disappointment
and
rage
.
<EOS>
He
be
suddenly
lift
from
the
ground
,
place
in
a
chair
,
and
bind
there
hand
and
foot
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
he
feel
the
air
flow
in
from
the
open
door
,
listen
,
and
conclude
that
he
be
alone
again
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
an
interval
elapse
,
and
he
hear
a
sound
below
like
the
rustle
sound
of
a
woman
's
dress
.
<EOS>
It
advance
up
the
stair
,
and
stop
.
<EOS>
a
female
scream
rent
the
atmosphere
of
guilt
.
<EOS>
a
man
's
voice
below
exclaim
"
Hullo
!
"
<EOS>
a
man
's
foot
ascend
the
stair
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
feel
christian
finger
unfasten
his
bandage
,
and
extract
his
gag
.
<EOS>
He
look
in
amazement
at
two
respectable
stranger
,
and
faintly
articulate
,
"
what
do
it
mean
?
<EOS>
"
the
two
respectable
stranger
look
back
,
and
say
,
"
exactly
the
question
we
be
go
to
ask
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
inevitable
explanation
follow
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
let
me
be
scrupulously
particular
.
<EOS>
Sal
volatile
and
water
follow
,
to
compose
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
's
nerve
.
<EOS>
the
explanation
come
next
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
from
the
statement
of
the
landlord
and
landlady
of
the
house
(
person
of
good
repute
in
the
neighbourhood
)
,
that
their
first
and
second
floor
apartment
have
be
engage
,
on
the
previous
day
,
for
a
week
certain
,
by
a
most
respectable
-
look
gentleman
 
the
same
who
have
be
already
describe
as
answer
the
door
to
Mr.
Godfrey
's
knock
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
have
pay
the
week
's
rent
and
all
the
week
's
extra
in
advance
,
state
that
the
apartment
be
want
for
three
oriental
nobleman
,
friend
of
his
,
who
be
visit
England
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
early
on
the
morning
of
the
outrage
,
two
of
the
oriental
stranger
,
accompany
by
their
respectable
english
friend
,
take
possession
of
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
the
third
be
expect
to
join
them
shortly
;
and
the
luggage
(
report
as
very
bulky
)
be
announce
to
follow
when
it
have
pass
through
the
Custom
-
house
,
late
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
not
more
than
ten
minute
previous
to
Mr.
Godfrey
's
visit
,
the
third
foreigner
have
arrive
.
<EOS>
nothing
out
of
the
common
have
happen
,
to
the
knowledge
of
the
landlord
and
landlady
down
-
stair
,
until
within
the
last
five
minute
 
when
they
have
see
the
three
foreigner
,
accompany
by
their
respectable
english
friend
,
all
leave
the
house
together
,
walk
quietly
in
the
direction
of
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
remember
that
a
visitor
have
call
,
and
not
have
see
the
visitor
also
leave
the
house
,
the
landlady
have
think
it
rather
strange
that
the
gentleman
should
be
leave
by
himself
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
discussion
with
her
husband
,
she
have
consider
it
advisable
to
ascertain
whether
anything
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
the
result
have
follow
,
as
I
have
already
attempt
to
describe
it
;
and
there
the
explanation
of
the
landlord
and
the
landlady
come
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
an
investigation
be
next
make
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
's
property
be
find
scatter
in
all
direction
.
<EOS>
when
the
article
be
collect
,
however
,
nothing
be
miss
;
his
watch
,
chain
,
purse
,
key
,
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
note
-
book
,
and
all
his
loose
paper
have
be
closely
examine
,
and
have
then
be
leave
unharmed
to
be
resume
by
the
owner
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
way
,
not
the
small
morsel
of
property
belong
to
the
proprietor
of
the
house
have
be
abstract
.
<EOS>
the
oriental
nobleman
have
remove
their
own
illuminate
manuscript
,
and
have
remove
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
what
do
it
mean
?
<EOS>
take
the
worldly
point
of
view
,
it
appear
to
mean
that
Mr.
Godfrey
have
be
the
victim
of
some
incomprehensible
error
,
commit
by
certain
unknown
man
.
<EOS>
a
dark
conspiracy
be
on
foot
in
the
midst
of
us
;
and
our
beloved
and
innocent
friend
have
be
entangle
in
its
mesh
.
<EOS>
when
the
christian
hero
of
a
hundred
charitable
victory
plunge
into
a
pitfall
that
have
be
dig
for
him
by
mistake
,
oh
,
what
a
warning
<EOS>
it
be
to
the
rest
of
us
to
be
unceasingly
on
our
guard
!
<EOS>
how
soon
may
our
own
evil
passion
prove
to
be
oriental
nobleman
who
pounce
on
us
unaware
!
  
<EOS>
I
could
write
page
of
affectionate
warning
on
this
one
theme
,
but
(
alas
!
)
<EOS>
I
be
not
permit
to
improve
 
I
be
condemn
to
narrate
.
<EOS>
My
wealthy
relative
's
cheque
 
<EOS>
henceforth
,
the
incubus
of
my
existence
 
warn
me
that
I
have
not
do
with
this
record
of
violence
yet
.
<EOS>
We
must
leave
Mr.
Godfrey
to
recover
in
Northumberland
Street
,
and
must
follow
the
proceeding
of
Mr.
Luker
at
a
later
period
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
after
leave
the
bank
,
Mr.
Luker
have
visit
various
part
of
London
on
business
errand
.
<EOS>
return
to
his
own
residence
,
he
find
a
letter
wait
for
him
,
which
be
describe
as
have
be
leave
a
short
time
previously
by
a
boy
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
,
as
in
Mr.
Godfrey
's
case
,
the
handwriting
be
strange
;
but
the
name
mention
be
the
name
of
one
of
Mr.
Luker
's
customer
.
<EOS>
His
correspondent
announce
(
write
in
the
third
person
 
apparently
by
the
hand
of
a
deputy
)
that
he
have
be
unexpectedly
summon
to
London
.
<EOS>
He
have
just
establish
himself
in
lodging
in
Alfred
Place
,
Tottenham
Court
Road
;
and
he
desire
to
see
Mr.
Luker
immediately
,
on
the
subject
of
a
purchase
which
he
contemplate
make
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
be
an
enthusiastic
collector
of
oriental
antiquity
,
and
have
be
for
many
year
a
liberal
patron
of
the
establishment
in
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
oh
,
when
shall
we
wean
ourselves
from
the
worship
of
Mammon
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
call
a
cab
,
and
drive
off
instantly
to
his
liberal
patron
.
  
<EOS>
exactly
what
have
happen
to
Mr.
Godfrey
in
Northumberland
Street
now
happen
to
Mr.
Luker
in
Alfred
Place
.
<EOS>
once
more
the
respectable
man
answer
the
door
,
and
show
the
visitor
up
-
stair
into
the
back
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
there
,
again
,
lie
the
illuminate
manuscript
on
a
table
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
's
attention
be
absorb
,
as
Mr.
Godfrey
's
attention
have
be
absorb
,
by
this
beautiful
work
of
indian
art
.
<EOS>
He
too
be
arouse
from
his
study
by
a
tawny
naked
arm
round
his
throat
,
by
a
bandage
over
his
eye
,
and
by
a
gag
in
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
too
be
throw
prostrate
and
search
to
the
skin
.
<EOS>
a
long
interval
have
then
elapse
than
have
pass
in
the
experience
of
Mr.
Godfrey
;
but
it
have
end
as
before
,
in
the
person
of
the
house
suspect
something
wrong
,
and
go
up
-
stair
to
see
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
precisely
the
same
explanation
which
the
landlord
in
Northumberland
Street
have
give
to
Mr.
Godfrey
,
the
landlord
in
Alfred
Place
now
give
to
Mr.
Luker
.
<EOS>
both
have
be
impose
on
in
the
same
way
by
the
plausible
address
and
well
-
fill
purse
of
the
respectable
stranger
,
who
introduce
himself
as
act
for
his
foreign
friend
.
<EOS>
the
one
point
of
difference
between
the
two
case
occur
when
the
scatter
content
of
Mr.
Luker
's
pocket
be
be
collect
from
the
floor
.
<EOS>
His
watch
and
purse
be
safe
,
but
(
less
fortunate
than
Mr.
Godfrey
)
<EOS>
one
of
the
loose
paper
that
he
carry
about
him
have
be
take
away
.
<EOS>
the
paper
in
question
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
a
valuable
of
great
price
which
Mr.
Luker
have
that
day
leave
in
the
care
of
his
banker
.
<EOS>
this
document
would
be
useless
for
purpose
of
fraud
,
inasmuch
as
it
provide
that
the
valuable
should
only
be
give
up
on
the
personal
application
of
the
owner
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
recover
himself
,
Mr.
Luker
hurry
to
the
bank
,
on
the
chance
that
the
thief
who
have
rob
him
may
ignorantly
present
themselves
with
the
receipt
.
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
see
of
them
when
he
arrive
at
the
establishment
,
and
nothing
be
see
of
them
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Their
respectable
english
friend
have
(
in
the
opinion
of
the
banker
)
look
the
receipt
over
before
they
attempt
to
make
use
of
it
,
and
have
give
them
the
necessary
warning
in
good
time
.
  
<EOS>
information
of
both
outrage
be
communicate
to
the
police
,
and
the
needful
investigation
be
pursue
,
I
believe
,
with
great
energy
.
<EOS>
the
authority
hold
that
a
robbery
have
be
plan
,
on
insufficient
information
receive
by
the
thief
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
plainly
not
sure
whether
Mr.
Luker
have
,
or
have
not
,
trust
the
transmission
of
his
precious
gem
to
another
person
;
and
poor
polite
Mr.
Godfrey
have
pay
the
penalty
of
have
be
see
accidentally
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
add
to
this
,
that
Mr.
Godfrey
's
absence
from
our
Monday
evening
meeting
have
be
occasion
by
a
consultation
of
the
authority
,
at
which
he
be
request
to
assist
 
and
all
the
explanation
require
be
now
give
,
I
may
proceed
with
the
simple
story
of
my
own
little
personal
experience
in
Montagu
Square
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
punctual
to
the
luncheon
hour
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
reference
to
my
diary
show
this
to
have
be
a
chequer
day
 
much
in
it
to
be
devoutly
regret
,
much
in
it
to
be
devoutly
thankful
for
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
Aunt
Verinder
receive
me
with
her
usual
grace
and
kindness
.
<EOS>
but
I
notice
,
after
a
little
while
,
that
something
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
certain
anxious
look
escape
my
aunt

I
never
see
Rachel
myself
without
wonder
how
it
can
be
that
so
insignificant
-
look
a
person
should
be
the
child
of
such
distinguished
parent
as
Sir
John
and
Lady
Verinder
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
however
,
she
not
only
disappoint
 
she
really
shock
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
absence
of
all
lady
-
like
restraint
in
her
language
and
manner
most
painful
to
see
.
<EOS>
She
be
possess
by
some
feverish
excitement
which
make
her
distressingly
loud
when
she
laugh
,
and
sinfully
wasteful
and
capricious
in
what
she
eat
and
drink
at
lunch
.
<EOS>
I
feel
deeply
for
her
poor
mother
,
even
before
the
true
state
of
the
case
have
be
confidentially
make
known
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
luncheon
over

my
aunt
say
:
"
remember
what

Rachel
,
about
quiet
yourself

your

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
into

but
if

I
be
tell
of
it

<EOS>
I
be
die
for
more
news
of
him
,
after

<EOS>
She
kiss
her

on
the

,
and
look
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
good

Clack

"
she
say
,
carelessly
.
<EOS>
Her
insolence
rouse
no
angry
feeling
in
me
;
I
only
make
a
private
memorandum
to
pray
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
leave
by
ourselves
,
my
aunt
tell
me
the
whole
horrible
story
of
the
Indian
Diamond
,
which
,
I
be
happy
to
know
<EOS>
,
it
be
not
necessary
to
repeat
here
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
conceal
from
me
that
she
would
have
prefer
keep
silence
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
but
when
her
own
servant
all
know
of
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone

and
when
some
of
the
circumstance
have
actually
find
their

when
stranger

speculate
whether
there
be
any
connection
between
what

house

and
what
have
happen
in
Northumberland

Alfred
Place
 
concealment
be
not

of
;
and
perfect
frankness
become
a
necessity
as
well
as
a
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
some
person
,
hear
what
I
now
hear
,
would
have
be
probably
overwhelm
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part

know
Rachel

spirit
to
have
be
essentially
unregenerate
from
her
childhood
upwards

I
be
prepare
for
whatever
my
aunt
could
tell
me
on
the
subject
of
her
daughter

<EOS>
It
may
have
go
on
from
bad
to
bad
till
it
end
in
murder

I

<EOS>
Lady

My

this

a
most
unfortunate
time

<EOS>
Rachel

<EOS>
She
leave
me
no
peace
till
I
have
write
and
ask
my

<EOS>
She
even
feel
an
interest
in
the
other
person
who
be
roughly
use
 
Mr.
Luker
,
or
some
such
name
 
though
the
man
be
,
of

,
a
total
stranger
to
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
Your

dear
aunt

be
superior
to
mine

"
I
suggest
diffidently
.
"
<EOS>
but
there
must
be
a
reason
surely
for
this
extraordinary
conduct
on
Rachel
's
part
.
<EOS>
She
be
keep
a
sinful
secret
from
you
and
from
everybody

<EOS>
May
there
not
be
something
in
these
recent
event

threaten
her
secret

Discovery

Discovery

<EOS>
as

a
special
providence
occur

<EOS>
the
servant
open
the
door
,
and
announce
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite

<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
follow
the
announcement
of
his
name
 
as
Mr.
Godfrey

everything
else
 
exactly
at
the
right
time
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
close
on
the
servant
's
heel
as
to
startle
us
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
far
behind
as
to
cause
us
the
double
inconvenience
of
a
pause
and
an
open
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
completeness
of
his
daily
life
that
the
true

<EOS>
this

very
complete

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
both
inquire
after
his
health

<EOS>
We
both
ask
him
together
whether
he
feel
like
himself
again
,
after
his
terrible
adventure
of
the
past
week
.
<EOS>
with
perfect
tact
,
he
contrive
to
answer
us
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
have
his
reply
in
word
.
<EOS>
I
have
his
charming
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
what

"
he
cry
,
with
infinite
tenderness

"
have
I
do

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
my
dear
Miss
Clack
!
<EOS>
I
have
merely
be
mistake
for
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
be
blindfold
;
I
have
only
be
strangle
;
I
have
only
be
throw
flat
on
my
back
,
on
a
very
thin
carpet
,
cover
a
particularly
hard
floor
.
<EOS>
just
think
how
much
bad
it
may
have
be
!
<EOS>
I
may
have
be
murder
;
I
may
have
be
rob
.
<EOS>
what
have
I
lose
?
<EOS>
nothing
but
Nervous
Force
 
which
the
law
do
not
recognise
as
property
;
so
that
,
strictly
speak
,
I
have
lose
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
have
have
my
own
way
,
I
would
have
keep
my
adventure
to
myself
 
<EOS>
I
shrink
from
all
this
fuss
and
publicity
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Luker
make
his
injury
public
,
and
my
injury
,
as
the
necessary
consequence
,
have
be
proclaim
in
their
turn
.
<EOS>
I
have
become
the
property
of
the
newspaper
,
until
the
gentle
reader
get
sick
of
the
subject

<EOS>
I
be
very
sick
indeed
of
it
myself

<EOS>
May
the
gentle
reader
soon
be
like
me

<EOS>
and
how
be
dear

<EOS>
still
enjoy
the
gaiety
of
London

<EOS>
so
glad
to
hear
it
!
<EOS>
Miss
Clack
,
I
need
all
your
indulgence
.
<EOS>
I
be
sadly
behind
-
hand
with
my
Committee
Work
and
my
dear
lady
.
<EOS>
but
I
really
do
hope
to
look
in
at
the
Mothers'-Small
-
Clothes
next
week
.
<EOS>
do
you
make
cheer
progress
at
Monday
's
Committee
?
<EOS>
be
the
Board
hopeful
about
future
prospect
?
<EOS>
and
be
we
nicely
off
for
trouser
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
heavenly
gentleness
of
his
smile
make
his
apology
irresistible
.
<EOS>
the
richness
of
his
deep
voice
add
its
own
indescribable
charm
to
the
interesting
business
question
which
he
have
just
address
to
me
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
we
be
almost
too
nicely
off
for
trouser
;
we
be
quite
overwhelmed
by
them
.
<EOS>
I
be
just
about
to
say
so
,
when
the
door
open
again
,
and
an
element
of
worldly
disturbance
enter
the
room
,
in
the
person
of
Miss
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
She
approach
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
at
a
most
unladylike
rate
of
speed
,
with
her
hair
shockingly
untidy
,
and
her
face
,
what
I
should
call
,
unbecomingly
flush
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
charm
to
see
you
,
Godfrey
,
"
she
say
,
address
him
,
I
grieve
to
add
,
in
the
off
-
hand
manner
of
one
young
man
talk
to
another
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
have
bring
Mr.
Luker
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
and
he
(
as
long
as
our
present
excitement
last
)
be
the
two
most
interesting
man
in
all
London
.
<EOS>
It
be
morbid
to
say
this
;
it
be
unhealthy
;
it
be
all
that
a
well
-
regulate
mind
like
Miss
Clack
's
most
instinctively
shudder
at
.
<EOS>
never
mind
that
.
<EOS>
tell
me
the
whole
of
the
Northumberland
Street
story
directly
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
newspaper
have
leave
some
of
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
even
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
partake
of
the
fall
nature
which
we
all
inherit
from
Adam
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
very
small
share
of
our
human
legacy
,
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
have
it
.
<EOS>
I
confess
it
grieve
me
to
see
him
take
Rachel
's
hand
in
both
of
his
own
hand
,
and
lie
it
softly
on
the
left
side
of
his
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
direct
encouragement
to
her
reckless
way
of
talking
,
and
her
insolent
reference
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Rachel
,
"
he
say
,
in
the
same
voice
which
have
thrill
me
when
he
speak
of
our
prospect
and
our
trouser
,
"
the
newspaper
have
tell
you
everything
 
<EOS>
and
they
have
tell
it
much
well
than
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Godfrey
think
we
all
make
too
much
of
the
matter
,
"
my
aunt
remark
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
just
be
say
that
he
do
not
care
to
speak
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
the
question
with
a
sudden
flash
in
her
eye
,
and
a
sudden
look
up
into
Mr.
Godfrey
's
face
.
<EOS>
on
his
side
,
he
look
down
at
her
with
an
indulgence
so
injudicious
and
so
ill
-
deserved
,
that
I
really
feel
call
on
to
interfere
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rachel
,
darling
!
<EOS>
"
I
remonstrate
gently
,
"
true
greatness
and
true
courage
be
ever
modest
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
very
good
fellow
in
your
way
,
Godfrey
,
"
she
say
 
not
take
the
small
notice
,
observe
,
of
me
,
and
still
speak
to
her
cousin
as
if
she
be
one
young
man
address
another
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
quite
sure
you
be
not
great
;
I
do
not
believe
you
possess
any
extraordinary
courage

I
be
firmly
persuade
 
if
you
ever
have
any
modesty
 
that
your
lady

worshipper
relieve
you
of
that
virtue
a
good
many
year
since

<EOS>
You
have
some
private
reason
for
not
talk
of
your
adventure
in
Northumberland
Street
;
and
I
mean
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
reason
be
the
simple
imaginable
,
and
the
most
easily
acknowledge
,
"
he
answer
,
still
bear
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
tired
of
the
subject

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
tired
of
the
subject

<EOS>
My
dear
Godfrey
,
I
be
go
to
make
a
remark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
live
a
great
deal
too
much
in
the
society
of
woman

<EOS>
and
you
have
contract
two
very
bad
habit
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
You
have
learn
to
talk
nonsense
seriously
,
and
you
have
get
into
a
way
of
tell
fib
for
the
pleasure
of
tell
them
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
go
straight
with
your
lady

worshipper

<EOS>
I
mean
to
make
you
go
straight
with
me

<EOS>
come
,
and
sit
down
.
<EOS>
I
be
brimful
of
downright
question

I
expect
you
to
be
brimful
of
downright
answer

<EOS>
She
actually
drag
him
across
the
room
to
a
chair
by
the
window
,
where
the
light
would
fall
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
deeply
feel
be
oblige
to
report
such
language
,
and
to
describe
such
conduct
.
<EOS>
but
,
hem
in
,
as
I
be
,
between
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
cheque
on
one
side
and
my
own
sacred
regard
for
truth
on
the
other
,
what
be
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
look
at
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
She
sit
unmoved
;
apparently
in
no
way
disposed
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
notice
this
kind
of
torpor
in
her
before
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
perhaps
,
the
reaction
after
the
try
time
she
have
have
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
not
a
pleasant
symptom
to
remark
,
be
it
<EOS>
what
it
may
,
at

Lady
Verinder

age

autumnal
exuberance

figure

in

settle

She
begin
the
string
of
question
with
which
she

threaten
him

no
more
notice

I

deeply
affected

I
close
my

remonstrance

stop
here
 
<EOS>
I
should
like

close
my
narrative
with
the
record
of
Mr.

noble
conduct

<EOS>
unhappily
there
be
more

much
more
,
which
the
unrelenting
pecuniary
pressure
of
Mr.

cheque
oblige
me
to
tell

<EOS>
the
painful
disclosure

be

Montagu
Square

<EOS>
find
myself
alone
with
Lady
Verinder

I
turn
naturally
to
the
subject
of
her
health

touch
delicately
on
the
strange
anxiety
which
she
have
show
to
conceal
her
indisposition

and
the
remedy
apply
to
it
,
from
the
observation
of

My

's
reply
greatly
surprise
me

mention

permit

to
mention
it
now

distressing
subject

<EOS>
I
rise
immediately
.
<EOS>
delicacy
leave
me
but
one
alternative
 
the
alternative
,
after
first
make
my
apology
,
of
take
my
leave
.
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
stop
me
,
and
insist
on
my
sit
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
surprise
a
secret

"
she
say
,
"
which
I
have
confide
to
my
sister
Mrs.
Ablewhite

to
my
lawyer
Mr.
Bruff

to
no
one
else

<EOS>
I
can
trust
in
their
discretion

and
I
be
sure
,
when
I
tell
you
the
circumstance
,
I
can
trust
in
yours

have
you
any
press
engagement

your
time
your
own

afternoon

<EOS>
It
be
needless
to
say
that
my
time
be
entirely
at
my
aunt
's
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
"
keep
me
company
then
,
"
she
say
,
"
for
another
hour

I
have
something
to
tell
you

I
believe
you
will
be
sorry
to
hear

I
shall
have
a
service
to
ask
of
you
afterwards
,
if
you
do
not
object
to
assist

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
again
needless
to
say
that
,
so
far
from
object
,
I
be
all
eagerness
to
assist
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
wait
here

"
she
go
on
,
"
till
Mr.
Bruff
come
at
five

you
can
be
one
of
the
witness

when
I
sign
my
will

"
  
<EOS>
Her
will
!
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
drop
which
I
have
see
in
her
work
-
box
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
bluish
tinge
which
I
have
notice
in
her
complexion
.
<EOS>
a
light
which
be
not
of
this
world
 
a
light
shine
prophetically
from
an
unmade
grave
 
dawn
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
secret
be
a
secret
no
longer
.
    
<EOS>
Consideration
for
poor
Lady
Verinder
forbid
me
even
to
hint
that
I
have
guess
the
melancholy
truth
,
before
she
open
her
lip
.
<EOS>
I
wait
her
pleasure
in
silence
;
and
,
have
privately
arrange
to
say
a
few
sustaining
word
at
the
first
convenient
opportunity
,
feel
prepared
for
any
duty
that
could
claim
me
,
no
matter
how
painful
it
may
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
seriously
ill
,
Drusilla
,
for
some
time
past
,
"
my
aunt
begin
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
strange
to
say
,
without
know
it
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
thousand
and
thousand
of
perish
human
creature
who
be
all
at
that
moment
spiritually
ill
,
without
know
it
themselves

<EOS>
and
I
greatly
fear
that
my
poor
aunt
may
be
one
of
the
number
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
dear
,
"
I
say
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
bring
Rachel
to
London
,
as
you
know
,
for
medical
advice

"
she
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
right
to
consult
two
doctor
.
"
  
<EOS>
two
doctor
!
<EOS>
and
,
oh
me
(
in
Rachel
's
state
)
,
<EOS>
not
one
clergyman
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
once
more
.
"
<EOS>
yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
of
the
two
medical
man
,
"
proceed
my
aunt
,
"
be
a
stranger
to
me

<EOS>
the
other
have
be
an
old
friend
of
my
husband
's
,
and
have
always
feel
a
sincere
interest
in
me
for
my
husband
's
sake
.
<EOS>
after
prescribe
for
Rachel
,
he
say
he
wish
to
speak
to
me
privately
in
another
room
.
<EOS>
I
expect
,
of
course
,
to
receive
some
special
direction
for
the
management
of
my
daughter
's
health
.
<EOS>
to
my
surprise
,
he
take
me
gravely
by
the
hand
,
and
say
,
"
I
have
be
look
at
you
,
Lady
Verinder
,
with
a
professional
as
well
as
a
personal
interest
.
<EOS>
You
be
,
I
be
afraid
,
far
more
urgently
in
need
of
medical
advice
than
your
daughter
.
"
<EOS>
He
put
some
question
to
me
,
which
I
be
at
first
incline
to
treat
lightly
enough
,
until
I
observe
that
my
answer
distress
him
.
<EOS>
It
end
in
his
make
an
appointment
to
come
and
see
me
,
accompany
by
a
medical
friend
,
on
the
next
day
,
at
an
hour
when
Rachel
would
not
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
the
result
of
that
visit
 
most
kindly
and
gently
convey
to
me
 
satisfy
both
the
physician
that
there
have
be
precious
time
lose
,
which
could
never
be
regain
,
and
that
my
case
have
now
pass
beyond
the
reach
of
their
art
.
<EOS>
for
more
than
two
year
I
have
be
suffer
under
an
insidious
form
of
heart
disease
,
which
,
without
any
symptom
to
alarm
me
,
have
,
by
little
and
little
,
fatally
break
me
down
.
<EOS>
I
may
live
for
some
month
,
or
I
may
die
before
another
day
have
pass
over
my
head
 
the
doctor
can
not
,
and
dare
not
,
speak
more
positively
than
this
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
vain
to
say
,
my
dear
,
that
I
have
not
have
some
miserable
moment
since
my
real
situation
have
be
make
known
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
more
resigned
than
I
be
,
and
I
be
do
my
good
to
set
my
worldly
affair
in
order
.
<EOS>
My
one
great
anxiety
be
that
Rachel
should
be
keep
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
if
she
know
it
,
she
would
at
once
attribute
my
broken
health
to
anxiety
about
the
Diamond
,
and
would
reproach
herself
bitterly
,
poor
child
,
for
what
be
in
no
sense
her
fault
.
<EOS>
both
the
doctor
agree
that
the
mischief
begin
two
,
if
not
three
year
since
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
keep
my
secret
,
<EOS>
Drusilla
 
<EOS>
for
I
be
sure
I
see
sincere
sorrow
and
sympathy
for
me
in
your
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
sorrow
and
sympathy
!
<EOS>
oh
,
what
Pagan
emotion
to
expect
from
a
Christian
Englishwoman
anchor
firmly
on
her
faith
!
  
<EOS>
little
do
my
poor
aunt
imagine
what
a
gush
of
devout
thankfulness
thrill
through
me
as
she
approach
the
close
of
her
melancholy
story
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
career
of
usefulness
open
before
me
!

here
be
a
beloved
relative

perish
fellow

on
the
eve
of
the
great
change

utterly
unprepared
;
and
lead
,
providentially
lead
,
to
reveal
her
situation
to
Me
!
<EOS>
how
can
I
describe
the
joy
with
which
I
now
remember
that
the
precious
clerical
friend
on
whom
I
could
rely
,
be
to
be
count
,
not
by
one
or
two
,
but
by
ten
and
twenty
.
<EOS>
I
take
my
aunt
in
my
arm
 
<EOS>
my
overflow
tenderness
be
not
to
be
satisfied
,
now
,
with
anything
less
than
an
embrace

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
to
her
,
fervently
,
"
the
indescribable
interest
with
which
you
inspire
me
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
the
good
<EOS>
I
mean
to
do
you
,
dear

before
we
part
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
another
word
or
two
of
earnest
prefatory
warning
,
I
give
her
her
choice
of
three
precious
friend
,
all
ply
the
work
of
mercy
from
morning
to
night
in
her
own
neighbourhood
;
all
equally
inexhaustible
in
exhortation
;
all
affectionately
ready
to
exercise
their
gift
at
a
word
from
me
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
the
result
be
far
from
encouraging
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Verinder
look
puzzled
and
frightened
,
and
meet
everything
I
could
say
to
her
with
the
purely
worldly
objection
that
she
be
not
strong
enough
to
face
stranger
.
<EOS>
I
yield
 
for
the
moment
only
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
My
large
experience
(
as
Reader
and
Visitor
,
under
not
less

first

last

fourteen
beloved
clerical

inform
me

another
case
for
preparation
by

pretty
story

<EOS>
I
have
pass
over
the
manner

which
this

have
remark
that
I
be
more
than
twenty
-
one
,
and
that
I
have
no
pecuniary
interest

my

but
the
tone
in
which
he
allude
to
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
be
too
much
for
my
forbearance
.
<EOS>
feel
bind
,
after
what
have
pass
in

that
afternoon

to
assert
the
innocence

my
admirable

whenever
I
find
it
call
in
question
 
I
own
to
have
also
feel
bind
to
include
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
righteous
purpose
,
a
stinging
castigation
in
the
case
of
Mr.
Bruff

<EOS>
"
I
live
very
much
out

say
;

I
do
not
possess

<EOS>
Mr.

will
not
find
the
world
in
general
quite
so
easy
to
convince
as
a
committee
of
charitable
lady
.
<EOS>
appearance
be
dead
against
him

<EOS>
He
be
in
the
house
when
the
Diamond
be
lose

<EOS>
and
he
be
the
first
person
in
the
house
to
go
to
London
afterwards

those
be
ugly
circumstance
,
madam

view
by
the
light
of
later
event

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
ought
,
I
know
,
to
have
set
him
right
before
he
go
any
farther
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
tell
him
that
he
be
speak
in
ignorance
of
a
testimony
to
Mr.
Godfrey

innocence

offer
by
the
only
person

be
undeniably
competent
to
speak
from

positive
knowledge

alas
!
<EOS>
the
temptation
to
lead
the
lawyer
artfully
on
to
his
own
discomfiture
be
too
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
ask
what
he
mean
by
"
later
event
"
 
with
an
appearance
of
the
utmost
innocence
.
  
<EOS>
"
by
later
event
,
Miss
Clack
,
I
mean
event
in
which
the
Indians
be
concern
,
"
proceed
Mr.
Bruff
,
get
more
and
more
superior
to
poor
Me
,
the
longer
he
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
the
Indians
do
,
the
moment
they
be
let
out
of
the
prison
at
Frizinghall
?
<EOS>
They
go
straight
to
London
,
and
fix
on
Mr.
Luker
.
<EOS>
what
follow
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
feel
alarm
for
the
safety
of
"
a
valuable
of
great
price
,
"
which
he
have
get
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
lodge
it
privately
(
under
a
general
description
)
in
his
banker
'
strong
-
room
.
<EOS>
wonderfully
clever
of
him
:
but
the
Indians
be
just
as
clever
on
their
side
.
<EOS>
They
have
their
suspicion
that
the
"
valuable
of
great
price
"
be
be
shift
from
one
place
to
another
;
and
they
hit
on
a
singularly
bold
and
complete
way
of
clear
those
suspicion
up
.
<EOS>
whom
do
they
seize
and
search
?
<EOS>
not
Mr.
Luker
only
 
which
would
be
intelligible
enough
 
but
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
as
well
.
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
explanation
be
,
that
they
act
on
blind
suspicion
,
after
see
him
accidentally
speak
to
Mr.
Luker
.
<EOS>
absurd
!
<EOS>
half
-
a
-
dozen
other
people
speak
to
Mr.
Luker
that
morning
.
<EOS>
why
be
they
not
follow
home
too
,
and
decoy
into
the
trap
?
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
the
plain
inference
be
,
that
Mr.
Ablewhite
have
his
private
interest
in
the
"
valuable
"
as
well
as
Mr.
Luker
,
and
that
the
Indians
be
so
uncertain
as
to
which
of
the
two
have
the
disposal
of
it
,
that
there
be
no
alternative
but
to
search
them
both
.
<EOS>
public
opinion

that
,
Miss
Clack

<EOS>
and
public
opinion
,
on
this
occasion
,
be
not
easily

"
  
<EOS>
He
say
those
last
word
,
look
so
wonderfully
wise
in
his
own
worldly
conceit
,
that
I
really
(
to
my
shame
be
it
spoken
)
could
not
resist
lead
him
a
little
farther
still
,
before
I
overwhelm
him
with
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
presume
to
argue
with
a
clever
lawyer
like
you
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
be
it
quite
fair
,
sir
,
to
Mr.
Ablewhite
to
pass
over
the
opinion
of
the
famous
London
police
officer
who
investigate
this
case
?
<EOS>
not
the
shadow
of
a
suspicion

upon
anybody

Miss
Verinder

in
the
mind
of
Sergeant
Cuff

you

tell
me
,
Miss

that
you
agree
with
the
Sergeant

<EOS>
"
I

nobody

enormity

I
judge
the
Sergeant

have
be
utterly
wrong

I
offer
the
opinion

Rachel

character

he
would
have
suspect

be
mislead

appearance

irritably
up

down

see
plainly

drop
from

more

absorb
in

suggest
to
my
mind
the
abominable
view
that
he
have
hitherto
take
of

mystery

He
have
not

suspect

the
infamy

steal
the
Diamond

attribute

own
authority
 
a
perfectly
unassailable
authority
,
as
you
be
aware
,
in
the
estimation
of
Mr.
Bruff
 
that
explanation
of
the
circumstance
be
now
show
to
be
utterly
wrong
.
<EOS>
the
perplexity
into
which
I
have
plunge
this
high
legal
authority
be
so
overwhelming
that
he
be
quite
unable
to
conceal
it
from
notice
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
case
!
<EOS>
"
I
hear
him
say
to
himself
,
stop
at
the
window
in
his
walk
,
and
drum
on
the
glass
with
his
finger
.
<EOS>
"
It
not
only
defy
explanation
,
it
be
even
beyond
conjecture
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
these
word
which
make
any
reply
at
all
needful
,
on
my
part
 
and
yet
,
I
answer
them
!
<EOS>
It
seem
hardly
credible
that
I
should
not
have
be
able
to
let
Mr.
Bruff
alone
,
even
now
.
<EOS>
It
seem
almost
beyond
mere
mortal
perversity
that
I
should
have
discover
,
in
what
he
have
just
say
,
a
new
opportunity
of
make
myself
personally
disagreeable
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
 
ah
,
my
friend
!
<EOS>
nothing
be
beyond
mortal
perversity
;
and
anything
be
credible
when
our
fall
nature
get
the
well
of
us
!
  
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
for
intrude
on
your
reflection
<EOS>
,
"
I
say
to
the
unsuspecting
Mr.
Bruff
.
"
<EOS>
but
surely
there
be
a
conjecture
to
make
which
have
not
occur
to
us
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
maybe
,
Miss
Clack
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
it
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
before
I
be
so
fortunate
,
sir
,
as
to
convince
you
of
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
innocence
,
you
mention
it
as
one
of
the
reason
for
suspect
him
,
that
he
be
in
the
house
at
the
time
when
the
Diamond
be
lose
.
<EOS>
permit
me
to
remind
you
that
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
be
also
in
the
house
at
the
time
when
the
Diamond
be
lose
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
old
worldling
leave
the
window
,
take
a
chair
exactly
opposite
to
mine
,
and
look
at
me
steadily
,
with
a
hard
and
vicious
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
so
good
<EOS>
a
lawyer

Miss
Clack

he
remark
in
a
meditative
manner
,
"
as
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
how
to
let
well
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
I
fail
to
follow
you
,
Mr.
Bruff

"
I
say
,
modestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
do
,
<EOS>
Miss
Clack
 
<EOS>
it
really
will
not
do
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
Franklin
Blake
be
a
prime
favourite
of
mine
,
as
you
be
well
aware
.
<EOS>
but
that
do
not
matter
.
<EOS>
I
will
adopt
your
view
,
on
this
occasion
,
before
you
have
time
to
turn
round
on
me
.
<EOS>
You
be
quite
right
,
madam
.
<EOS>
I
have
suspect
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
on
ground
which
abstractedly
justify
suspect
Mr.
Blake
too
.
<EOS>
very
good
 
<EOS>
let
's
suspect
them
together
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
in
his
character
,
we
will
say
,
to
be
capable
of
steal
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
the
only
question
be
,
whether
it
be
his
interest
to
do
so
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
debt
,
"
I
remark
,
"
be
matter
of
family
notoriety
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
debt
have
not
arrive
at
that
stage
of
development
yet
.
<EOS>
quite
true
.
<EOS>
but
there
happen
to
be
two
difficulty
in
the
way
of
your
theory
,
Miss
Clack
.
<EOS>
I
manage
Franklin
Blake
's
affair
,
and
I
beg
to
inform
you
that
the
vast
majority
of
his
creditor
(
know
his
father
to
be
a
rich
man
)
be
quite
content
to
charge
interest
on
their
debt
,
and
to
wait
for
their
money
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
first
difficulty
 
which
be
tough
enough
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
the
second
tougher
still
.
<EOS>
I
have
it
on
the
authority
of
Lady
Verinder
herself
,
that
her
daughter
be
ready
to
marry
Franklin
Blake
,
before
that
infernal
Indian
Diamond
disappear
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
have
draw
him
on
and
put
him
off
again
,
with
the
coquetry
of
a
young
girl
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
confess
to
her
mother
that
she
love
cousin
Franklin
,
and
her
mother
have
trust
cousin
Franklin
with
the
secret
.
<EOS>
so
there
he
be
,
Miss
Clack
,
with
his
creditor
content
to
wait
,
and
with
the
certain
prospect
before
him
of
marry
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
by
all
mean
consider
him
a
scoundrel
;
but
tell
me
,
if
you
please
,
why
he
should
steal
the
moonstone
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
human
heart
be
unsearchable
,
"
I
say
gently
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
to
fathom
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
other
word
,
madam
 
though
he
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
take
the
Diamond
 
he
may
have
take
it
,
nevertheless
,
through
natural
depravity
.
<EOS>
very
well
.
<EOS>
say
he
do
.
<EOS>
why
the
devil
 
"
  
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
if
I
hear
the
devil
refer
to
in
that
manner
,
I
must
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Miss
Clack
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
more
careful
in
my
choice
of
language
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
all
I
mean
to
ask
be
this
.
<EOS>
why
 
even
suppose
he
do
take
the
Diamond
 
<EOS>
should
Franklin
Blake
make
himself
the
most
prominent
person
in
the
house
in
try
to
recover
it
?
<EOS>
You
may
tell
me
he
cunningly
do
that
to
divert
suspicion
from
himself
.
<EOS>
I
answer
that
he
have
no
need
to
divert
suspicion
 
because
nobody
suspect
him
.
<EOS>
He
first
steal
the
Moonstone
(
without
the
slight
reason
)
through
natural
depravity
;
and
he
then
act
a
part
,
in
relation
to
the
loss
of
the
jewel
,
which
there
be
not
the
slight
necessity
to
act
,
and
which
lead
to
his
mortally
offend
the
young
lady
who
would
otherwise
have
marry
him
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
monstrous
proposition
which
you
be
drive
to
assert
,
if
you
attempt
to
associate
the
disappearance
of
the
Moonstone
with
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
Miss
Clack
!
<EOS>
after
what
have
pass
here
to
-
day
,
between
us
two

this
case

<EOS>
Rachel
's
own
innocence
be
(
as
her
mother
know
,
and
as
I
know
)
beyond
a
doubt

<EOS>
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
innocence
be
equally
certain
 
or
Rachel
would
never
have
testify
to
it

Franklin

unanswerably
assert
itself

hand

morally
certain
of
all
these

and
,
on

sure

London

that

his

be
in

Sergeant

I
be
about
to
mention
this
,
with
all
possible
mildness
,
and
with
every
necessary
protest
against
be

to
cast
a
slur
upon
Rachel
 
when
the

come
in

<EOS>
this
stop
the
discussion

<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
collect
his
paper
,
look
a
little
exhaust
by
the
demand
which
our
conversation
have
make
on
him
.
<EOS>
I
take
up
my
bag
-
full
of
precious
publication
,
feel
as
if
I
could
have
go
on
talk
for
hour
.
<EOS>
We
proceed
in
silence
to
Lady
Verinder
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
permit
me
to
add
here
,
before
my
narrative
advance
to
other
event
,
that
I
have
not
describe
what
pass
between
the
lawyer
and
me
,
without
have
a
definite
object
in
view
.
<EOS>
I
be
order
to
include
in
my
contribution
to
the
shocking
story
of
the
Moonstone
a
plain
disclosure
,
not
only
of
the
turn
which
suspicion
take
,
but
even
of
the
name
of
the
person
on
whom
suspicion
rest
,
at
the
time
when
the
Indian
Diamond
be
believe
to
be
in
London
.
<EOS>
a
report
of
my
conversation
in
the
library
with
Mr.
Bruff
appear
to
me
to
be
exactly
what
be
want
to
answer
this
purpose
 
<EOS>
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
it
possess
the
great
moral
advantage
of
render
a
sacrifice
of
sinful
self
-
esteem
essentially
necessary
on
my
part

<EOS>
I
have
be
oblige
to
acknowledge

in
make
that
humiliating
confession
,
I
get
the
well

my
fall
nature

<EOS>
the
moral
balance
be
restore
;
the
spiritual
atmosphere
feel
clear
once
more
.
<EOS>
dear
friend
,
we
may
go
on
again
.
    
<EOS>
the
signing
of
the
Will
be
a
much
short
matter
than
I
have
anticipate
.
<EOS>
It
be
hurry
over
,
to
my
thinking
,
in
indecent
haste
.
<EOS>
Samuel
,
the
footman
,
be
send
for
to
act
as
second
witness
 
and
the
pen
be
put
at
once
into
my
aunt
's
hand
.
<EOS>
I
feel
strongly
urged
to
say
a
few
appropriate
word
on
this
solemn
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Bruff
's
manner
convince
me
that
it
be
wisest
to
check
the
impulse
while
he
be
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
two
minute
it
be
all
over
 
and
Samuel
(
unbenefite
by
what
I
may
have
say
)
<EOS>
have
go
downstairs
again
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
fold
up
the
Will
,
and
then
look
my
way
;
apparently
wonder
whether
I
do
or
do
not
mean
to
leave
him
alone
with
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
mission
of
mercy
to
fulfil
,
and
my
bag
of
precious
publication
ready
on
my
lap
.
<EOS>
He
may
as
well
have
expect
to
move
St.
Paul
's
Cathedral
by
look
at
it
,
as
to
move
Me
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
merit
about
him
(
due
no
doubt
to
his
worldly
training
)
which
I
have
no
wish
to
deny
.
<EOS>
He
be
quick
at
see
thing
.
<EOS>
I
appear
to
produce
almost
the
same
impression
on
him
which
I
have
produce
on
the
cabman
.
<EOS>
he
too
utter
a
profane
expression
,
and
withdraw
in
a
violent
hurry
,
and
leave
me
mistress
of
the
field
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
be
alone
,
my
aunt
recline
on
the
sofa
,
and
then
allude
,
with
some
appearance
of
confusion
,
to
the
subject
of
her
Will

"
I

here

a
golden
opportunity

I
seize
it
on
the
spot

<EOS>
in
other
word

I
instantly
open
my
bag

take
out
the
top
publication

<EOS>
It
prove
to
be
an
early
edition
 
<EOS>
only
the
twenty

fifth
 
of
the
famous
anonymous
work
(
believe
to
be
by
precious
Miss
Bellows
)
,
entitle
the
SERPENT
AT
HOME
.
<EOS>
the
design
of
the
book
 
with
which
the
worldly
reader
may
not
be
acquaint
 
be
to
show
how
the
Evil
One
lie
in
wait
for
us
in
all
the
most
apparently
innocent
action
of
our
daily
life

<EOS>
the
chapter
best
adapt

perusal
be
"
Satan

Poor

glance
at
the

hand
it
back

more
confused

creature

notoriously
infidel
profession
of
Medicine

step
between
me
and
my
mission
of
mercy
 
on
the
miserable
pretence
that
the
patient
want
quiet

that
the
disturbing
influence
of
all
other
which
they
most
dread
,
be
the
influence
of
Miss
Clack
and
her
book

<EOS>
precisely
the

blinded
materialism

treacherously

seek
to
rob

<EOS>
there
be
no

any

superior
importance

such
a

with

provoke

his

to
threaten
to
throw
up

happily

an
hour
or
two
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
or
you
may
wake
,
to
-
morrow
morning
,
with
a
sense
of
something
want
,
and
even
this
unpretende
volume
may
be
able
to
supply
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
let
me
leave
the
book
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
the
doctor
can
hardly
object
to
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
slip
it
under
the
sofa
cushion
,
half
in
,
and
half
out
,
close
by
her
handkerchief
,
and
her
smelling
-
bottle
.
<EOS>
every
time
her
hand
search
for
either
of
these
,
it
would
touch
the
book
;
and
,
sooner
or
later
(
who
know
?
)
<EOS>
the
book
may
touch
her
.
<EOS>
after
make
this
arrangement
,
I
think
it
wise
to
withdraw
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
leave
you
to
repose
,
dear
aunt
;
I
will
call
again
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
I
look
accidentally
towards
the
window
as
I
say
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
full
of
flower
,
in
box
and
pot
.
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
be
extravagantly
fond
of
these
perishable
treasure
,
and
have
a
habit
of
rise
every
now
and
then
,
and
go
to
look
at
them
and
smell
them
.
<EOS>
a
new
idea
flash
across
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
may
I
take
a
flower
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
 
and
get
to
the
window
unsuspecte
,
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
instead
of
take
away
a
flower
,
I
add
one
,
in
the
shape
of
another
book
from
my
bag
,
which
I
leave
,
to
surprise
my
aunt
,
among
the
geranium
and
rose
.
<EOS>
the
happy
thought
follow
,
"
why
not
do
the
same
for
her
,
poor
dear
,
in
every
other
room
that
she
enter
?
<EOS>
"
I
immediately
say
good
-
bye
;
and
,
cross
the
hall
,
slip
into
the
library
.
<EOS>
Samuel
,
come
up
to
let
me
out
,
and
suppose
I
have
go
,
go
down
-
stair
again
.
<EOS>
on
the
library
table
I
notice
two
of
the
"
amusing
book
"
which
the
infidel
doctor
have
recommend
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
cover
them
from
sight
with
two
of
my
own
precious
publication
.
<EOS>
in
the
breakfast
-
room
I
find
my
aunt
's
favourite
canary
singe
in
his
cage
.
<EOS>
She
be
always
in
the
habit
of
feed
the
bird
herself
.
<EOS>
some
groundsel
be
strew
on
a
table
which
stand
immediately
under
the
cage
.
<EOS>
I
put
a
book
among
the
groundsel
.
<EOS>
in
the
drawing
-
room
I
find
more
cheering
opportunity
of
empty
my
bag
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
favourite
musical
piece
be
on
the
piano
.
<EOS>
I
slip
in
two
more
book
among
the
music
.
<EOS>
I
dispose
of
another
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
under
some
unfinished
embroidery
,
which
I
know
to
be
of
Lady
Verinder
be
working
.
<EOS>
a
third
little
room
open
out
of
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
from
which
it
be
shut
off
by
curtain
instead
of
a
door
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
plain
old
-
fashioned
fan
be
on
the
chimney
-
piece
.
<EOS>
I
open
my
ninth
book
at
a
very
special
passage
,
and
put
the
fan
in
as
a
marker
,
to
keep
the
place
.
<EOS>
the
question
then
come
,
whether
I
should
go
higher
still
,
and
try
the
bed
-
room
floor
 
at
the
risk
,
undoubtedly
,
of
be
insult
,
if
the
person
with
the
cap
-
ribbon
happen
to
be
in
the
upper
region
of
the
house
,
and
to
find
me
out
.
<EOS>
but
oh
,
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
It
be
a
poor
Christian
that
be
afraid
of
be
insult
.
<EOS>
I
go
upstairs
,
prepare
to
bear
anything
.
<EOS>
all
be
silent
and
solitary
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
servant
'
tea
-
time
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
room
be
in
front
.
<EOS>
the
miniature
of
my
late
dear
uncle
,
Sir
John
,
hang
on
the
wall
opposite
the
bed
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
smile
at
me
;
it
seem
to
say
,
"
Drusilla
!
<EOS>
deposit
a
book
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
table
on
either
side
of
my
aunt
's
bed
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
bad
sleeper
,
and
want
,
or
think
she
want
,
many
thing
at
night
.
<EOS>
I
put
a
book
near
the
match
on
one
side
,
and
a
book
under
the
box
of
chocolate
drop
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
whether
she
want
a
light
,
or
whether
she
want
a
drop
,
there
be
a
precious
publication
to
meet
her
eye
,
or
to
meet
her
hand
,
and
to
say
with
silent
eloquence
,
in
either
case
,
"
come
,
try
me
!
<EOS>
try
me
!
"
<EOS>
but
one
book
be
now
leave
at
the
bottom
of
my
bag
,
and
but
one
apartment
be
still
unexplore
 
<EOS>
the
bath
-
room
,
which
open
out
of
the
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
peep
in
;
and
the
holy
inner
voice
that
never
deceive
,
whisper
to
me
,
"
<EOS>
You
have
meet
her
,
Drusilla
,
everywhere
else
;
meet
her
at
the
bath
,
and
the
work
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
I
observe
a
dressing
-
gown
throw
across
a
chair
.
<EOS>
It
have
a
pocket
in
it
,
and
in
that
pocket
I
put
my
last
book
.
<EOS>
Can
word
express
my
exquisite
sense
of
duty
do
,
when
I
have
slip
out
of
the
house
,
unsuspecte
by
any
of
them
,
and
when
I
find
myself
in
the
street
with
my
empty
bag
under
my
arm
?
<EOS>
oh
,
my
worldly
friend
,
pursue
the
phantom
,
Pleasure
,
through
the
guilty
maze
of
Dissipation
,
how
easy
it
be
to
be
happy
,
if
you
will
only
be
good
!
  
<EOS>
when
I
fold
up
my
thing
that
night
 
when
I
reflect
on
the
true
rich
which
I
have
scatter
with
such
a
lavish
hand
,
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
house
of
my
wealthy
aunt
 
<EOS>
I
declare
I
feel
as
free
from
all
anxiety
as
if
I
have
be
a
child
again
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
light
-
hearted
that
I
sing
a
verse
of
the
Evening
Hymn
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
light
-
hearted
that
I
fall
asleep
before
I
could
sing
another
.
<EOS>
quite
like
a
child
again
!
<EOS>
quite
like
a
child
again
!
  
<EOS>
so
I
pass
that
blissful
night
.
<EOS>
on
rise
the
next
morning
,
how
young
I
feel
!
<EOS>
I
may
add
,
how
young
I
look
,
if
I
be
capable
of
dwell
on
the
concern
of
my
own
perishable
body
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
capable
 
<EOS>
and
I
add
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
towards
luncheon
time
 
not
for
the
sake
of
the
creature
-
comfort
,
but
for
the
certainty
of
find
dear
aunt
 
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
bonnet
to
go
to
Montagu
Square
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
be
ready
,
the
maid
at
the
lodging
in
which
I
then
live
look
in
at
the
door
,
and
say
,
"
Lady
Verinder
's
servant
,
to
see
Miss
Clack
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
occupy
the
parlour
-
floor
,
at
that
period
of
my
residence
in
London
.
<EOS>
the
front
parlour
be
my
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
very
small
,
very
low
in
the
ceiling
,
very
poorly
furnish
 
<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
so
neat
!
<EOS>
I
look
into
the
passage
to
see
which
of
Lady
Verinder
's
servant
have
ask
for
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
young
footman
,
Samuel
 
a
civil
fresh
-
coloured
person
,
with
a
teachable
look
and
a
very
obliging
manner
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
feel
a
spiritual
interest
in
Samuel
,
and
a
wish
to
try
him
with
a
few
serious
word
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
I
invite
him
into
my
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
in
,
with
a
large
parcel
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
when
he
put
the
parcel
down
,
it
appear
to
frighten
him
.
<EOS>
"
My
lady
's
love
,
Miss
;
and
I
be
to
say
that
you
would
find
a
letter
inside
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
give
that
message
,
the
fresh
-
coloured
young
footman
surprise
me
by
look
as
if
he
would
have
like
to
run
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
detain
him
to
make
a
few
kind
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Could
I
see
my
aunt
,
if
I
call
in
Montagu
Square
?
<EOS>
no
;
she
have
go
out
for
a
drive
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
have
go
with
her
,
and
Mr.
Ablewhite
have
take
a
seat
in
the
carriage
,
too
.
<EOS>
know
how
sadly
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
's
charitable
work
be
in
arrear
,
I
think
it
odd
that
he
should
be
go
out
drive
,
like
an
idle
man
.
<EOS>
I
stop
Samuel
at
the
door
,
and
make
a
few
more
kind
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rachel
be
go
to
a
ball
that
night
,
and
Mr.
Ablewhite
have
arrange
to
come
to
coffee
,
and
go
with
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
morning
concert
advertise
for
to
-
morrow
,
and
Samuel
be
order
to
take
place
for
a
large
party
,
include
a
place
for
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
"
all
the
ticket
may
be
go
,
Miss
,
"
say
this
innocent
youth
,
"
if
I
do
not
run
and
get
them
at
once
!
"
<EOS>
He
run
as
he
say
the
word
 
<EOS>
and
I
find
myself
alone
again
,
with
some
anxious
thought
to
occupy
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
special
meeting
of
the
Mothers'-Small
-
Clothes
-
Conversion
Society
that
night
,
summon
expressly
with
a
view
to
obtain
Mr.
Godfrey
's
advice
and
assistance
.
<EOS>
instead
of
sustain
our
sisterhood
,
under
an
overwhelming
flow
of
trouser
which
quite
prostrate
our
little
community
,
he
have
arrange
to
take
coffee
in
Montagu
Square
,
and
to
goto
a
ball
afterwards
!
<EOS>
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
have
be
select
for
the
Festival
of
the
British

ladies'-servants'-sunday
-

<EOS>
instead
of

present
,
the
life
and
soul
of
that
struggle
Institution
,
he
have
engage
to
make
one
of
a
party
of
worldling
at
a
morning
concert
!
<EOS>
I
ask
myself
what
do
it
mean
?
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
it
mean
that
our
Christian
Hero
be
to
reveal
himself
to
me
in
a
new
character
,
and
to
become
associated
in
my
mind
with
one
of
the
most
awful
backsliding
of
modern
time
.
  
<EOS>
to
return
,
however
,
to
the
history
of
the
pass
day
.
<EOS>
on
find
myself
alone
in
my
room
,
I
naturally
turn
my
attention
to
the
parcel
which
appear
to
have
so
strangely
intimidate
the
fresh
-
coloured
young
footman
.
<EOS>
have
my
aunt
send
me
my
promised
legacy
?
<EOS>
and
have
it
take
the
form
of
cast
-
off
clothe
,
or
wear
-
out
silver
spoon
,
or
unfashionable
jewellery
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
?
<EOS>
prepared
to
accept
all
,
and
to
resent
nothing
,
I
open
the
parcel
 
and
what
meet
my
view
?
<EOS>
the
twelve
precious
publication
which
I
have
scatter
through
the
house
,
on
the
previous
day
;
all
return
to
me
by
the
doctor
's
order
!
<EOS>
well
may
the
youthful
Samuel
shrink
when
he
bring
his
parcel
into
my
room
!
<EOS>
well
may
he
run
when
he
have
perform
his
miserable
errand
!
<EOS>
as
to
my
aunt
's
letter
,
it
simply
amount
,
poor
soul
,
to
this
 
that
she
dare
not
disobey
her
medical
man
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
now
?
<EOS>
with
my
training
and
my
principle
,
I
never
have
a
moment
's
doubt

<EOS>
once
self
-
support
by
conscience
,
once
embark
on
a
career
of
manifest
usefulness
,
the
true
Christian
never
yield
.
<EOS>
neither
public
nor
private
influence
produce
the
slight
effect
on
us
,
when
we
have
once
get
our
mission
.
<EOS>
taxation
may
be
the
consequence
of
a
mission
;
riot
may
be
the
consequence
of
a
mission
;
war
may
be
the
consequence
of
a
mission
:
we
go
on
with
our
work
,
irrespective
of
every
human
consideration
which
move
the
world
outside
us
.
<EOS>
We
be
above
reason

we
be
beyond
ridicule

we
see
with
nobody

eye

we
hear
with
nobody

and
how

<EOS>
ah

spare
yourself
the
useless
inquiry

We

can
earn
it
 
for
we

<EOS>
in
the
case
of
my
misguided

pious
perseverance

take

itself
to
me
plainly
enough

arrangement
for
send
through
the
post
,
and
six
I
keep
in
my
pocket
for
personal
distribution
in
the
house
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
two
o'clock
I
be
again
on
the
field
of
pious
conflict
,
address
more
kind
inquiry
to
Samuel
at
Lady
Verinder
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
My
aunt
have
have
a
bad
night
.
<EOS>
She
be
again
in
the
room
in
which
I
have
witness
her
will
,
rest
on
the
sofa
,
and
try
to
get
a
little
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
I
would
wait
in
the
library
,
on
the
chance
of
see
her
.
<EOS>
in
the
fervour
of
my
zeal
to
distribute
the
letter
,
it
never
occur
to
me
to
inquire
about
Rachel
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
quiet
,
and
it
be
past
the
hour
at
which
the
musical
performance
begin
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
for
grant
that
she
and
her
party
of
pleasure
-
seeker
(
Mr.
Godfrey
,
alas
!
<EOS>
include
)
be
all
at
the
concert
,
and
eagerly
devote
myself
to
my
good
work
,
while
time
and
opportunity
be
still
at
my
own
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
My
aunt
's
correspondence
of
the
morning
 
include
the
six
awakening
letter
which
I
have
post
overnight
 
be
lie
unopened
on
the
library
table
.
<EOS>
She
have
evidently
not
feel
herself
equal
to
deal
with
a
large
mass
of
letter
 
<EOS>
and
she
may
be
daunt
by
the
number
of
them
,
if
she
enter
the
library
later
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
I
put
one
of
my
second
set
of
six
letter
on
the
chimney
-
piece
by
itself
;
leave
it
to
attract
her
curiosity
,
by
mean
of
its
solitary
position
,
apart
from
the
rest
.
<EOS>
a
second
letter
I
put
purposely
on
the
floor
in
the
breakfast
-
room
.
<EOS>
the
first
servant
who
go
in
after
me
would
conclude
that
my
aunt
have
drop
it
,
and
would
be
specially
careful
to
restore
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
field
thus
sow
on
the
basement
story
,
I
run
lightly
upstairs
to
scatter
my
mercy
next
over
the
draw
-
room
floor
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
I
enter
the
front
room
,
I
hear
a
double
knock
at
the
street
-
door
 
a
soft
,
flutter
,
considerate
little
knock
.
<EOS>
before
I
could
think
of
slip
back
to
the
library
(
in
which
I
be
suppose
to
be
wait
)
,
the
active
young
footman
be
in
the
hall
,
answer
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
matter
little
,
as
I
think
.
<EOS>
in
my
aunt
's
state
of
health
,
visitor
in
general
be
not
admit
.
<EOS>
to
my
horror
and
amazement
,
the
performer
of
the
soft
little
knock
prove
to
be
an
exception
to
general
rule
.
<EOS>
Samuel
's
voice
below
me
(
after
apparently
answer
some
question
which
I
do
not
hear
)
say
,
unmistakably
,
"
upstairs
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
the
next
moment
I
hear
footstep
 
<EOS>
a
man
's
footstep
 
approach
the
drawing
-
room
floor
.
<EOS>
who
could
this
favour
male
visitor
possibly
be
?
<EOS>
almost
as
soon
as
I
ask
myself
the
question
,
the
answer
occur
to
me
.
<EOS>
who
COULD
it
be
but
the
doctor
?
  
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
any
other
visitor
,
I
should
have
allow
myself
to
be
discover
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
there
would
have
be
nothing
out
of
the
common
in
my
have
get
tired
of
the
library
,
and
have
go
upstairs
for
a
change
.
<EOS>
but
my
own
self
-
respect
stand
in
the
way
of
my
meeting
the
person
who
have
insult
me
by
send
me
back
my
book
.
<EOS>
I
slip
into
the
little
third
room
,
which
I
have
mention
as
communicate
with
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
and
drop
the
curtain
which
close
the
open
doorway
.
<EOS>
if
I
only
wait
there
for
a
minute
or
two
,
the
usual
result
in
such
case
would
take
place
.
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
the
doctor
would
be
conduct
to
his
patient
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
wait
a
minute
or
two
,
and
more
than
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
visitor
walk
restlessly
backwards
and
forwards
.
<EOS>
I
also
hear
him
talk
to
himself
.
<EOS>
I
even
think
I
recognise
the
voice
.
<EOS>
have
I
make
a
mistake
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
the
doctor
,
but
somebody
else
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
,
for
instance
?
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
an
unerring
instinct
tell
me
it
be
not
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
whoever
he
be
,
he
be
still
talk
to
himself
.
<EOS>
I
part
the
heavy
curtain
the
least
little
morsel
in
the
world
,
and
listen
.
  
<EOS>
the
word
I
hear
be
,
"
I
will
do
it
to
-
day
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
voice
that
speak
them
be
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
.
    
<EOS>
My
hand
drop
from
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
suppose
 
oh
,
do
not
suppose
 
that
the
dreadful
embarrassment
of
my
situation
be
the
uppermost
idea
in
my
mind
!
<EOS>
so
fervent
still
be
the
sisterly
interest
I
feel
in
Mr.
Godfrey
,
that
I
never
stop
to
ask
myself
why
he
be
not
at
the
concert
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
I
think
only
of
the
word
 
<EOS>
the
startling
word
 
which
have
just
fall
from
his
lip
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
it
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
,
in
a
tone
of
terrible
resolution
,
he
would
do
it
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
what
,
<EOS>
oh
what
,
would
he
do
?
<EOS>
something
even
more
deplorably
unworthy
of
him
than
what
he
have
do
already
?
<EOS>
Would
he
apostatise
from
the
faith
?
<EOS>
Would
he
abandon
us
at
the
Mothers'-Small
-
Clothes
?
<EOS>
have
we
see
the
last
of
his
angelic
smile
in
the
committee
-
room
?
<EOS>
have
we
hear
the
last
of
his
unrivalled
eloquence
at
Exeter
Hall
?
<EOS>
I
be
so
work
up
by
the
bare
idea
of
such
awful
eventuality
as
these
in
connection
with
such
a
man
,
<EOS>
that
I
believe
I
should
have
rush
from
my
place
of
concealment
,
and
implore
him
in
the
name
of
all
the
Ladies
'
Committees
in
London
to
explain
himself
 
when
I
suddenly
hear
another
voice
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
penetrate
through
the
curtain
;
it
be
loud
,
it
be
bold
,
it
be
want
in
every
female
charm
.
<EOS>
the
voice
of
Rachel
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
have
you
come
up
here
,
Godfrey
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
go
into
the
library
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
laugh
softly
,
and
answer
,
"
Miss
Clack
be
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
clack
in
the
library
!
"
<EOS>
She
instantly
seat
herself
on
the
ottoman
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
right
,
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
We
have
much
well
stop
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
a
burn
fever
,
a
moment
since
,
and
in
some
doubt
what
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
I
become
extremely
cold
now
,
and
feel
no
doubt
whatever
.
<EOS>
to
show
myself
,
after
what
I
have
hear
,
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
to
retreat
 
except
into
the
fireplace
 
be
equally
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
a
martyrdom
be
before
me
.
<EOS>
in
justice
to
myself
,
I
noiselessly
arrange
the
curtain
so
that
I
could
both
see
and
hear
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
meet
my
martyrdom
,
with
the
spirit
of
a
primitive
Christian
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
sit
on
the
ottoman
,
"
the
young
lady
proceed
.
<EOS>
"
bring
a
chair
,
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
I
like
people
to
be
opposite
to
me
when
I
talk
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
the
near
seat
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
low
chair
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
tall
,
and
many
size
too
large
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
his
leg
to
such
disadvantage
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
she
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
to
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
what
you
say
,
dear
Rachel
,
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
mamma
be
not
at
all
well
to

day

<EOS>
and
that
I
do
not
quite
like
leave
her
to
go
to
the
concert
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
those
be
the
word
.
<EOS>
They
be
grieve
to
lose
you
at
the
concert
,
but
they
quite
understand
.
<EOS>
all
send
their
love
;
and
all
express
a
cheer
belief
that
Lady
Verinder
's
indisposition
would
soon
pass
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
you
do
not
think
it
be
serious
,
do
you
,
Godfrey
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
far
from
it
!
<EOS>
in
a
few
day
,
I
feel
quite
sure
,
all
will
be
well
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
too
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
frightened
at
first
,
but
I
think
so
too
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
kind
to
go
and
make
my
excuse
for
me
to
people
who
be
almost
stranger
to
you
.
<EOS>
but
why
not
have
go
with
them
to
the
concert
?
<EOS>
It
seem
very
hard
that
you
should
miss
the
music
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
say
that
,
Rachel
!
<EOS>
if
you
only
know
how
much
happy
I
be
 
here
,
with
you

<EOS>
He
clasp
his
hand
,
and
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
in
the
position
which
he
occupy
,
when
he
do
that
,
he
turn
my
way
.
<EOS>
Can
word
describe
how
I
sicken
when
I
notice
exactly
the
same
pathetic
expression
on
his
face

which
have
charm
me
when
he
be
plead
for
destitute
million
of
his
fellow

creature
on
the
platform
at
Exeter
Hall

<EOS>
"
It
be
hard
to
get
over
one
's
bad
habit
,
Godfrey
.
<EOS>

do
try
to
get
over
the
habit

I
never

sometimes

He
draw
his

close

take
her
hand
,
when

"
hopeless

there
be
a
momentary
silence

<EOS>
He

who
thrill
everybody

have
doubtless
thrill

I
think
I
now
understand
the
word

have
drop
from
him
when
he
be
alone

His

tremble

he
put
his

to

<EOS>
nothing

I
hear
a

you

I
wish

at

<EOS>
if
the
annal
of
apostasy
offer
anything
comparable
to
such
a
declaration
as
that
,
I
can
only
say
that
the
case
in
point
be
not
producible
from
the
store
of
my
reading

<EOS>
I
think
of
the
Mothers'-Small
-
Clothes
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
Sunday
-
Sweetheart
-
Supervision
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
other
Societies

too
numerous
to
mention
,
all
build
up
on
this
man
as
on
a
tower
of
strength

<EOS>
I
think
of
the
struggle
Female

,
who
,
so
to
speak
,
draw
the
breath
of
their
business

life
through

Mr.

who
have
just
revile
our
good
work
as
a

nuisance

just
declare
that
he
wish
he
be
at

uttermost
end

he
find
himself
in
our
company

<EOS>
My
young
female
friend
will
feel
encouraged
to
persevere
,
when
I
mention
that
it
try
even
My
discipline
before
I
could
devour
my
own
righteous
indignation
in
silence
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
it
be
only
justice
to
myself
to
add
,
that
I
do
not
lose
a
syllable
of
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
Rachel
be
the
next
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
make
your
confession
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
it
would
cure
you
of
your
unhappy
attachment
to
me

if
I
make
mine

<EOS>
He
start
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
start
too
.
<EOS>
He
think
,

I
think
,

She
turn

this
death

myself
in

see
this
clerical
castaway
make
one
of

player
at

inform

at

be
no
secret
at
all

the
grand
question
for
Mr.

another
confirm
castaway

be
how
to
make
himself

his

most
agreeable

the
wealthy
young
lady
who
be
go

marry
his
son

Rachel
give
him
some
trouble
at
the
outset

about
the
choice
of
a
place

could
be
prevail
upon
to
reside

the
house
in

associate

death

house
in
Yorkshire

scandalous
affair

lose
Moonstone

Her
guardian
's
own
residence
at
Frizinghall
be
open
to
neither
of
these
objection

Rachel
's
presence
in
it
,
after
her
recent
bereavement
,
operate
as
a
check
on
the
gaiety
of
her
cousin
,
the
Miss
Ablewhites
 
<EOS>
and
she
herself
request
that
her
visit
may
be
defer
to
a
more
favourable
opportunity

It
end
in
a
proposal
,
emanate
from
old
Mr.
Ablewhite

to
try
a
furnished
house
at
Brighton

<EOS>
His
wife
,
an

Rachel
be
to
inhabit
it
together

be
to
expect
him
to
join
them
later
in
the
season

They
would
see
no
society
but
a
few
old
friend
,
and
they
would
have
his
son
Godfrey
,
travel
backwards
and
forwards
by
the
London
train
,
always
at
their
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
I
describe
this
aimless
flit
about
from
one
place
of
residence
to
another
 
<EOS>
this
insatiate
restlessness
of
body
and
appalling
stagnation
of
soul
 
merely
with
the
view
to
arrive
at
result
.
<EOS>
the
event
which
(
under
Providence
)
prove
to
be
the
mean
of
bring
Rachel
Verinder
and
myself
together
again
,
be
no
other
than
the
hiring
of
the
house
at
Brighton
.

My
Aunt
Ablewhite
be
a
large
,
silent
,
fair
-
complexioned
woman
,
with
one
noteworthy
point
in
her
character

<EOS>
from
the
hour
of
her
birth
she
have
never
be
know
to
do
anything
for
herself

have
go
through
life
,
accept
everybody
's
help
,
and
adopt
everybody
's
opinion
.

a
more
hopeless
person

in
a
spiritual
point
of

I
have
never

be

so
see
Rachel
again
for
the
first
time
since
we
have
part
in
Montagu
Square

<EOS>
She
look
pitiably
small

thin

deep
mourning

<EOS>
if
I
attach
any
serious
importance
to
such
a
perishable
trifle
as
personal
appearance

I
may
be
incline
to
add
that
her
be
one
of
those
unfortunate
complexion
which
always
suffer
when
not
relieve
by
a
border
of
white
next
the
skin

up

a
young
woman
in
a
state
of
bereavement
,
with
so
little
idea
of
where
to
look
for
true
comfort
,
that
she
actually
expect
to
find
it
among
her
mother
's
friend
!
<EOS>
here
be
a
relative
of
mine
,
awaken
to
a
sense
of
her
shortcoming
towards
other
,
under
the
influence
,
not
of
conviction
and
duty
,
but
of
sentiment
and
impulse
!
<EOS>
most
deplorable
to
think
of
 
<EOS>
but
,
still
,
suggestive
of
something
hopeful
,
to
a
person
of
my
experience
in
ply
the
good
work
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
harm
,
I
think
,
in
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
change
which
the
loss
of
her
mother
have
work
in
Rachel
's
character
.
<EOS>
I
decide
,
as
a
useful
test
,
to
probe
her
on
the
subject
of
her
marriage
-
engagement
to
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
  
<EOS>
have
first
meet
her
advance
with
all
possible
cordiality
,
I
sit
by
her
on
the
sofa
,
at
her
own
request
.
<EOS>
We
discuss
family
affair
and
future
plan
 
always
except
that
one
future
plan
which
be
to
end
in
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
try
as
I
may
to
turn
the
conversation
that
way
,
she
resolutely
decline
to
take
the
hint
.
<EOS>
any
open
reference
to
the
question
,
on
my
part
,
would
have
be
premature
at
this
early
stage
of
our
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
have
discover
all
I
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
She
be
no
longer
the
reckless
,
defiant
creature
whom
I
have
hear
and
see
,
on
the
occasion
of
my
martyrdom
in
Montagu
Square
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
of
itself
,
enough
to
encourage
me
to
take
her
future
conversion
in
hand
 
begin
with
a
few
word
of
earnest
warning
direct
against
the
hasty
formation
of
the
marriage
tie
,
and
so
get
on
to
high
thing
.
<EOS>
look
at
her
,
now
,
with
this
new
interest
 
and
call
to
mind
the
headlong
suddenness
with
which
she
have
meet
Mr.
Godfrey
's
matrimonial
view
 
<EOS>
I
feel
the
solemn
duty
of
interfere
with
a
fervour
which
assure
me
that
I
should
achieve
no
common
result
.
<EOS>
rapidity
of
proceeding
be
,
as
I
believe
,
of
importance
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
I
go
back
at
once
to
the
question
of
the
servant
want
for
the
furnished
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
the
list
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rachel
produce
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cook

and
footman

I
read
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Rachel
,
these
servant
be
only
want
for
a
term
 
<EOS>
the
term
during
which
your
guardian
have
take
the
house
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
great
difficulty
in
find
person
of
character
and
capacity
to
accept
a
temporary
engagement
of
that
sort
,
if
we
try
in
London
.
<EOS>
have
the
house
in
Brighton
be
find
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
have
take
it
;
and
person
in
the
house
want
him
to
hire
them
as
servant
.
<EOS>
He
think
they
would
hardly
do
for
us
,
and
come
back
have
settle
nothing
.

<EOS>
"
and
you
have
no
experience
yourself
in
these
matter

Rachel

<EOS>
"
none
whatever

and
Aunt
Ablewhite
will
not
exert
herself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
poor
dear

<EOS>
do
not
blame
her

Drusilla

I

only
really
happy

there
be
degree

We
must
have
a
little
talk

some
day

on
that
subject

<EOS>
in
the
meantime
I
will
undertake
to
meet
the
difficulty
about
the
servant
.
<EOS>
Your
aunt
will
write
a
letter
to
the
people
of
the
house
 
<EOS>

"
She
will
sign
a
letter
,
if
I
write
it
for
her
,
which
come
to
the

thing

quite
the

<EOS>
in
those
word
the
invitation
be
give
,
and
the
glorious
prospect
of
interference
be
open
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
then
the
middle
of
the
week
.
<EOS>
by
Saturday
afternoon
the
house
be
ready
for
them
.
<EOS>
in
that
short
interval
I
have
sift
,
not
the
character
only
,
but
the
religious
view
as
well
,
of
all
the
disengaged
servant
who
apply
to
me
,
and
have
succeed
in
make
a
selection
which
my
conscience
approve

<EOS>
I
also
discover
,
and
call
on
two
serious
friend

resident
in
the
town
,
to
whom
I
know
I
could
confide
the
pious
object

have
bring
me
to
Brighton

<EOS>
one
of
them
 
a
clerical
friend
 
kindly

me
to
take
sitting
for
our
little
party
in
the

place
the
resource

<EOS>
I
borrow
half

dozen
work

all
carefully
choose
with
a
view
to
Rachel

<EOS>
when
these
have
be
judiciously
distribute
in
the
various
room
she
would
be
likely
to
occupy

I
consider
that
my
preparation

<EOS>
sound

<EOS>
alas

<EOS>
how
many
of

feel
my
exquisite
sense

<EOS>
an
awful
question

let

not

between
six
and
seven
the
traveller

<EOS>
to
my
indescribable
surprise
,
they
be
escort

"
how

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
that

the
occasion
on

I
have
oblige
him
to
postpone
his

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
remain
to
dinner
,
and
stay
through
the
evening
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
see
of
him
,
the
more
certain
I
feel
that
he
have
some
private
end
to
serve
in
come
to
Brighton
.
<EOS>
I
watch
him
carefully
.
<EOS>
He
maintain
the
same
appearance
of
ease
,
and
talk
the
same
godless
gossip
,
hour
after
hour
,
until
it
be
time
to
take
leave
.
<EOS>
as
he
shake
hand
with
Rachel
,
I
catch
his
hard
and
cunning
eye
rest
on
her
for
a
moment
with
a
peculiar
interest
and
attention
.
<EOS>
She
be
plainly
concerned
in
the
object
that
he
have
in
view
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
out
of
the
common
to
her
or
to
anyone
on
leave
.
<EOS>
He
invite
himself
to
luncheon
the
next
day
,
and
then
he
go
away
to
his
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
the
next
morning
to
get
my
Aunt
Ablewhite
out
of
her
dressing
-
gown
in
time
for
church
.
<EOS>
Her
invalid
daughter
(
suffer
from
nothing
,
in
my
opinion
,
but
incurable
laziness
,
inherit
from
her
mother
)
announce
that
she
mean
to
remain
in
bed
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
Rachel
and
I
go
alone
together
to
church
.
<EOS>
a
magnificent
sermon
be
preach
by
my
gifted
friend
on
the
heathen
indifference
of
the
world
to
the
sinfulness
of
little
sin

more
than
an
hour
his
eloquence

assist
by
his
glorious
voice

thunder
through
the
sacred
edifice

<EOS>
I
say
to
Rachel
,
when
we
come
out
,
"
have
it
find
its
way
to
your
heart
,

?
"
<EOS>
and
she
answer
,
"
no
;
it
have
only
make
my
head
ache

<EOS>
"
this
may
have
be
discourage
to
some
people
;
but
,
once
embark
on
a
career
of
manifest
usefulness

nothing
discourage
Me

<EOS>
We
find
Aunt
Ablewhite
and
Mr.
Bruff
at
luncheon
.
<EOS>
when
Rachel
decline
eat
anything
,
and
give
as
a
reason
for
it
that
she
be
suffer
from
a
headache

the
lawyer
's
cunning
instantly
see
,
and
seize
,
the
chance
that
she
have
give
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
there

only
one
remedy

this
horrible
old
man

It

I
gently

and
the
afternoon
service

begin
at
three

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
expect

she
ask
,
petulantly
,
"
with
such
a
headache
as
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
officiously
open
the
door
for
her
.
<EOS>
in
another
minute
more
they
be
both
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
when
I
have
feel
the
solemn
duty
of
interfere
so
strongly
as
I
feel
it
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
to
be
do
?
<EOS>
nothing
be
to
be
do
but
to
interfere
at
the
first
opportunity
,
later
in
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
on
my
return
from
the
afternoon
service
I
find
that
they
have
just
get
back
.
<EOS>
one
look
at
them
tell
me
that
the
lawyer
have
say
what
he
want
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
before
see
Rachel
so
silent
and
so
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
before
see
Mr.
Bruff
pay
her
such
devoted
attention
,
and
look
at
her
with
such
marked
respect
.
<EOS>
He
have
(
or
pretend
that
he
have
)
an
engagement
to
dinner
that
day
 
<EOS>
and
he
take
an
early
leave
of
us
all
;
intend
to
go
back
to
London
by
the
first
train
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
sure
of
your
own
resolution
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
Rachel
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
sure
,
"
she
answer
 
and
so
they
part
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
his
back
be
turn
,
Rachel
withdraw
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
She
never
appear
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
Her
maid
(
the
person
with
the
cap
-
ribbon
)
be
send
down
-
stair
to
announce
that
her
headache
have
return
.
<EOS>
I
run
up
to
her
and
make
all
sort
of
sisterly
offer
through
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
lock
,
and
she
keep
it
lock
.
<EOS>
plenty
of
obstructive
material
to
work
on
here
!
<EOS>
I
feel
greatly
cheered
and
stimulate
by
her
lock
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
when
her
cup
of
tea
go
up
to
her
the
next
morning
,
I
follow
it
in
.
<EOS>
I
sit
by
her
bedside
and
say
a
few
earnest
word
.
<EOS>
She
listen
with
languid
civility
.
<EOS>
I
notice
my
serious
friend
's
precious
publication
huddle
together
on
a
table
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
have
she
chance
to
look
into
them
?
 
<EOS>
I
ask
.
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
and
they
have
not
interest
her
.
<EOS>
Would
she
allow
me
to
read
a
few
passage
of
the
deep
interest
,
which
have
probably
escape
her
eye
?
<EOS>
no
,
not
now
 
she
have
other
thing
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
She
give
these
answer
,
with
her
attention
apparently
absorb
in
fold
and
refolde
the
frilling
on
her
nightgown
.
<EOS>
It
be
plainly
necessary
to
rouse
her
by
some
reference
to
those
worldly
interest
which
she
still
have
at
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
love
<EOS>
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
have
an
odd
fancy
,
yesterday
,
about
Mr.
Bruff
?
<EOS>
I
think
,
when
I
see
you
after
your
walk
with
him
,
that
he
have
be
tell
you
some
bad
news
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
finger
drop
from
the
frilling
of
her
nightgown
,
and
her
fierce
black
eye
flash
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
the
contrary
!

<EOS>
she
say
.

It
be
news
<EOS>
I
be
interested
in

<EOS>

"
I
say
,
in
a
tone
of
gentle
interest

<EOS>
Her
finger
go
back
to
the
frilling
,
and
she
turn
her
head
sullenly
away
from
me

<EOS>
I
have
be

in

manner

in

of

She
merely
stimulate
me
to
try
again

<EOS>
in
my
dauntless
zeal
for

welfare

I
run
the
great
risk

openly
allude
to

I
repeat

I

news
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite

"
  
She
start
up
in
the
bed
,
and
turn
deadly
pale
.
<EOS>
It
be
evidently
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
retort
on
me
with
the
unbridled
insolence
of
former
time
.
<EOS>
She
check
herself
 
lay
her
head
back
on
the
pillow
 
<EOS>
consider
a
minute
 
and
then
answer
in
these
remarkable
word
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never

<EOS>
GODFREY
ABLEWHITE

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
my
turn
to
start
at
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
you
possibly
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
the
marriage
be
consider
by
the
whole
family
as
a
settle
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
be
expect
here
to
-
day
,
"
she
say
doggedly
.
"
<EOS>
wait
till
he
come
 
and
you
will
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
my
dear
Rachel
 
"
  
She
ring
the
bell
at
the
head
of
her
bed
.
<EOS>
the
person
with
the
cap
-
ribbon
appear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Penelope
!
<EOS>
my
bath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
let
me
give
her
her
due
.
<EOS>
in
the
state
of
my
feeling
at
that
moment
,
I
do
sincerely
believe
that
she
have
hit
on
the
only
possible
way
of
force
me
to
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
mere
worldly
mind
my
position
towards
Rachel
may
have
be
view
as
present
difficulty
of
no
ordinary
kind
.
<EOS>
I
have
reckon
on
lead
her
to
high
thing
by
mean
of
a
little
earnest
exhortation
on
the
subject
of
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
if
she
be
to
be
believe
,
no
such
event
as
her
marriage
be
to
take
place
at
all
.
<EOS>
but
ah
,
my
friend
!
<EOS>
a
work
Christian
of
my
experience
(
with
an
evangelise
prospect
before
her
)
take
broad
view
than
these
.
<EOS>
Supposing
Rachel
really
break
off
the
marriage
,
on
which
the
Ablewhites
,
father
and
son
,
count
as
a
settle
thing
,
what
would
be
the
result
?
<EOS>
It
could
only
end
,
if
she
hold
firm
,
in
an
exchanging
of
hard
word
and
bitter
accusation
on
both
side
.
<EOS>
and
what
would
be
the
effect
on
Rachel
when
the
stormy
interview
be
over
?
<EOS>
a
salutary
moral
depression
would
be
the
effect
.
<EOS>
Her
pride
would
be
exhaust
,
her
stubbornness
would
be
exhaust
,
by
the
resolute
resistance
which
it
be
in
her
character
to
make
under
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
She
would
turn
for
sympathy
to
the
near
person
who
have
sympathy
to
offer
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
that
near
person
 
brimful
of
comfort
,
charge
to
overflow
with
seasonable
and
revive
word
.
<EOS>
never
have
the
evangelise
prospect
look
bright
,
to
my
eye
,
than
it
look
now
.
  
<EOS>
She
come
down
to
breakfast
,
but
she
eat
nothing
,
and
hardly
utter
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
after
breakfast
she
wander
listlessly
from
room
to
room
 
then
suddenly
rouse
herself
,
and
open
the
piano
.
<EOS>
the
music
she
select
to
play
be
of
the
most
scandalously
profane
sort
,
associate
with
performance
on
the
stage
which
it
curdle
one
's
blood
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
premature
to
interfere
with
her
at
such
a
time
as
this
.
<EOS>
I
privately
ascertain
the
hour
at
which
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
be
expect
,
and
then
I
escape
the
music
by
leave
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
be
out
alone
,
I
take
the
opportunity
of
call
upon
my
two
resident
friend
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
indescribable
luxury
to
find
myself
indulge
in
earnest
conversation
with
serious
person
.
<EOS>
infinitely
encouraged
and
refresh
<EOS>
,
I
turn
my
step
back
again
to
the
house
,
in
excellent
time
to
await
the
arrival
of
our
expect
visitor
.
<EOS>
I
enter
the
dining
-
room
,
always
empty
at
that
hour
of
the
day
,
and
find
myself
face
to
face
with
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
!
  
<EOS>
He
make
no
attempt
to
fly
the
place
.
<EOS>
quite
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
He
advance
to
meet
me
with
the
utmost
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Clack

,
in
consequence
,
earlier
than
my
appoint
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
not
the
slight
embarrassment
encumber
his
explanation
,
though
this
be
his
first
meeting
with
me
after
the
scene
in
Montagu
Square
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
aware
,
it
be
true
,
of
my
have
be
a
witness
of
that
scene
.
<EOS>
but
he
know
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
my
attendance
at
the
Mothers
'
Small
-
clothe
,
and
my
relation
with
friend
attach
to
other
charity
,
must
have
inform
me
of
his
shameless
neglect
of
his
Ladies
and
of
his
Poor
.
<EOS>
and
yet
there
he
be
before
me
,
in
full
possession
of
his
charming
voice
and
his
irresistible
smile
!
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
see
Rachel
yet
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
He
sigh
gently
,
and
take
me
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
have
snatch
my
hand
away
,
if
the
manner
in
which
he
give
his
answer
have
not
paralyse
me
with
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
Rachel
,
"
he
say
with
perfect
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
aware
,
dear
friend
,
that
she
be
engage
to
me
?
<EOS>
well
,
she
have
take
a
sudden
resolution
to
break
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
reflection
have
convince
her
that
she
will
best
consult
her
welfare
and
mine
by
retract
a
rash
promise
,
and
leave
me
free
to
make
some
happy
choice
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
only
reason
she
will
give
,
and
the
only
answer
she
will
make
to
every
question
that
I
can
ask
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
you
do
on
your
side
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
<EOS>
"
have
you
submit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
say
with
the
most
unruffled
composure
,
"
I
have
submit
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
conduct
,
under
the
circumstance
,
be
so
utterly
inconceivable
,
that
I
stand
bewilder
with
my
hand
in
his
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
piece
of
rudeness
to
stare
at
anybody
,
and
it
be
an
act
of
indelicacy
to
stare
at
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
commit
both
those
impropriety
.
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
as
if
in
a
dream
,
"
what
do
it
mean
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
permit
me
to
tell
you
,

he
reply
.
"
<EOS>
and
suppose
we
sit
down
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
lead
me
to
a
chair
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
indistinct
remembrance
that
he
be
very
affectionate
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
he
put
his
arm
<EOS>
round
my
waist
to
support
me
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
sure
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
helpless
,
and
his
way
with
lady
be
very
endearing
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
we
sit
down
.
<EOS>
I
can
answer
for
that

if
I
can
answer
for
nothing
more

feeling

go

sentence

I
find
that

have
change
her
mind

when

hear
her
propose

I
experience
<EOS>
(

<EOS>
a

overpowering
sense

relief

month

I
be
press
her
rapturously
to
my
bosom

<EOS>
an
hour
ago

the
happiness
of
know
that
I
shall
never
press
her
again
,
intoxicate
me
like
strong
liquor
.
<EOS>
the
thing
seem
impossible
 
the
thing
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
the
fact
,
as
I
have
the
honour
of
state
them
when
we
first
sit
down
together
in
these
two
chair
.
<EOS>
I
have
lose
a
beautiful
girl
,
an
excellent
social
position
,
and
a
handsome
income
;
and
I
have
submit
to
it
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
Can
you
account
for
it
,
dear
friend
?
<EOS>
It
be
quite
beyond
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
magnificent
head
sink
on
his
breast
,
and
he
give
up
his
own
mental
problem
in
despair
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
deeply
touch
.
<EOS>
the
case
(
if
I
may
speak
as
a
spiritual
physician
)
be
now
quite
plain
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
uncommon
event
,
in
the
experience
of
us
all
,
to
see
the
possessor
of
exalt
ability
occasionally
humble
to
the
level
of
the
most
poorly
-
gift
people
about
them
.
<EOS>
the
object
,
no
doubt
,
in
the
wise
economy
of
Providence
,
be
to
remind
greatness
that
it
be
mortal
and
that
the
power
which
have
confer
it
can
also
take
it
away
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
 
to
my
mind
 
easy
to
discern
one
of
these
salutary
humiliation
in
the
deplorable
proceeding
on
dear
Mr.
Godfrey
's
part
,
of
which
I
have
be
the
unseen
witness
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
equally
easy
to
recognise
the
welcome
reappearance
of
his
own
fine
nature
in
the
horror
with
which
he
recoil
from
the
idea
of
a
marriage
with
Rachel
,
and
in
the
charming
eagerness
which
he
show
to
return
to
his
Ladies
and
his
Poor
.
  
<EOS>
I
put
this
view
before
him
in
a
few
simple
and
sisterly
word
.
<EOS>
His
joy
be
beautiful
to
see
.
<EOS>
He
compare
himself
,
as
I
go
on
,
to
a
lost
man
emerge
from
the
darkness
into
the
light
.
<EOS>
when
I
answer
for
a
love
reception
of
him
at
the
Mothers
'
Small
-
Clothes
,
the
grateful
heart
of
our
Christian
Hero
overflow
.
<EOS>
He
press
my
hand
alternately
to
his
lip
.
<EOS>
overwhelm
by
the
exquisite
triumph
of
have
get
him
back
among
us
,
I
let
him
do
what
he
like
with
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
close
my
eye
.
<EOS>
I
feel
my
head
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
spiritual
self
-
forgetfulness
,
sink
on
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
in
a
moment
more
I
should
certainly
have
swoon
away
in
his
arm
,
but
for
an
interruption
from
the
outer
world
,
which
bring
me
to
myself
again
.
<EOS>
a
horrid
rattle
of
knife
and
fork
sound
outside
the
door
,
and
the
footman
come
in
to
lay
the
table
for
luncheon
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
start
up
,
and
look
at
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
time
fly
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
barely
catch
the
train
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
venture
on
ask
why
he
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
get

<EOS>
His
answer
remind
me
of
family
difficulty
that
be
still
to
be
reconcile
,
and
of
family
disagreement
that
be
yet
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

he

<EOS>
"
business
oblige
him
to
leave
Frizinghall
for
London
to

day

and
he
propose
come
on
here

either
this
evening
or
to

morrow

<EOS>
I
must
tell
him
what
have
happen
between
Rachel
and
me

<EOS>
His
heart
be
set
on
our
marriage
 
there
will
be
great
difficulty
,
I
fear
,
in
reconcile
him
to
the
breaking

off
of

I
must
stop
him

for

<EOS>
best

"
  
<EOS>
with
those
word
he
hurry
out
.
<EOS>
in
equal
haste
on
my
side
,
I
run
upstairs
to
compose
myself
in
my
own
room
before
meet
Aunt
Ablewhite
and
Rachel
at
the
luncheon
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
well
aware
 
to
dwell
for
a
moment
yet
on
the
subject
of
Mr.
Godfrey
 
that
the
all
-
profane
opinion
of
the
world
have
charge
him
with
have
his
own
private
reason
for
release
Rachel
from
her
engagement
,
at
the
first
opportunity
she
give
him
.
<EOS>
It
have
also
reach
my
ear
,
that
his
anxiety
to
recover
his
place
in
my
estimation
have
be
attribute
in
certain
quarter
,
to
a
mercenary
eagerness
to
make
his
peace
(
through
me
)
with
a
venerable
committee
-
woman
at
the
Mothers
'
Small
-
clothe
,
abundantly
bless
with
the
good
of
this
world
,
and
a
beloved
and
intimate
friend
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
only
notice
these
odious
slander
for
the
sake
of
declare
that
they
never
have
a
moment
's
influence
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
in
obedience
to
my
instruction
,
I
have
exhibit
the
fluctuation
in
my
opinion
of
our
Christian
Hero
,
exactly
as
I
find
them
record
in
my
diary
.
<EOS>
in
justice
to
myself
,
let
me
here
add
that
,
once
reinstate
in
his
place
in
my
estimation
,
my
gifted
friend
never
lose
that
place
again
.
<EOS>
I
write
with
the
tear
in
my
eye
,
burn
to
say
more
.
<EOS>
but
no
 
I
be
cruelly
limited
to
my
actual
experience
of
person
and
thing
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
a
month
from
the
time
of
which
I
be
now
write
,
event
in
the
money
-
market
(
which
diminish
even
my
miserable
little
income
)
force
me
into
foreign
exile
,
and
leave
me
with
nothing
but
a
love
remembrance
of
Mr.
Godfrey
which
the
slander
of
the
world
have
assail
,
and
assail
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
dry
my
eye
,
and
return
to
my
narrative
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
downstairs
to
luncheon
,
naturally
anxious
to
see
how
Rachel
be
affect
by
her
release
from
her
marriage
engagement
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
 
<EOS>
but
I
own
I
be
a
poor
authority
in
such
matter
 
that
the
recovery
of
her
freedom
have
set
her
thinking
again
of
that
other
man
whom
she
love
,
and
that
she
be
furious
with
herself
for
not
be
able
to
control
a
revulsion
of
feeling
of
which
she
be
secretly
ashamed
.
<EOS>
who
be
the
man
?
<EOS>
I
have
my
suspicion
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
needless
to
waste
time
in
idle
speculation
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
convert
her
,
she
would
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
have
no
concealment
from
Me
.
<EOS>
I
should
hear
all
about
the
man
;
I
should
hear
all
about
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
have
no
high
object
in
stir
her
up
to
a
sense
of
spiritual
thing
,
the
motive
of
relieve
her
mind
of
its
guilty
secret
would
have
be
enough
of
itself
to
encourage
me
to
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
Aunt
Ablewhite
take
her
exercise
in
the
afternoon
in
an
invalid
chair
.
<EOS>
Rachel
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
drag
the
chair
,
"
she
break
out
,
recklessly
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
fatigue
myself
till
I
be
ready
to
drop
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
in
the
same
humour
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
discover
in
one
of
my
friend
's
precious
publication
 
<EOS>
the
Life
,
Letters
,
and
Labours
of
Miss
Jane
Ann
Stamper
,
forty
-
fourth
edition
 
<EOS>
passage
which
bear
with
a
marvellous
appropriateness
on
Rachel
's
present
position
.
<EOS>
upon
my
proposing
to
read
them
,
she
go
to
the
piano
.
<EOS>
conceive
how
little
she
must
have
know
of
serious
people
,
if
she
suppose
that
my
patience
be
to
be
exhaust
in
that
way
!
<EOS>
I
keep
Miss
Jane
Ann
Stamper
by
me
,
and
wait
for
event
with
the
most
unfaltering
trust
in
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Ablewhite
never
make
his
appearance
that
night
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
the
importance
which
his
worldly
greed
attach
to
his
son
's
marriage
with
Miss
Verinder
 
<EOS>
and
I
feel
a
positive
conviction
<EOS>
(
do
what
Mr.
Godfrey
may
to
prevent
it
)
that
we
should
see
him
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
with
his
interference
in
the
matter
,
the
storm
on
which
I
have
count
would
certainly
come
,
and
the
salutary
exhaustion
of
Rachel
's
resist
power
would
as
certainly
follow
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
ignorant
that
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
have
the
reputation
generally
(
especially
among
his
inferior
)
of
be
a
remarkably
good
-
natured
man
.
<EOS>
accord
to
my
observation
of
him
,
he
deserve
his
reputation
as
long
as
he
have
his
own
way
,
and
not
a
moment
longer
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
exactly
as
I
have
foresee
,
Aunt
Ablewhite
be
as
near
to
be
astonish
as
her
nature
would
permit
,
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
have
barely
be
a
minute
in
the
house
,
before
he
be
follow
,
to
my
astonishment
this
time
,
by
an
unexpected
complication
in
the
shape
of
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
remember
feel
the
presence
of
the
lawyer
to
be
more
unwelcome
than
I
feel
it
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
look
ready
for
anything
in
the
way
of
an
obstructive
proceeding
 
capable
even
of
keep
the
peace
with
Rachel
for
one
of
the
combatant
!
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
pleasant
surprise
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
address
himself
with
his
deceptive
cordiality
to
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
leave
your
office
yesterday
,
I
do
not
expect
to
have
the
honour
of
see
you
at
Brighton
to

day

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
turn
over
our
conversation
in
my
mind
,
after
you
have
go
,
"
reply
Mr.
Bruff
.
"
<EOS>
and
it
occur
to
me
that
I
may
perhaps
be
of
some
use
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
be
just
in
time
to
catch
the
train
,
and
I
have
no
opportunity
of
discover
the
carriage
in
which
you
be
travel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
give
that
explanation
,
he
seat
himself
by
Rachel
.
<EOS>
I
retire
modestly
to
a
corner
 
with
Miss
Jane
Ann
Stamper
on
my
lap
,
in
case
of
emergency
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
sit
at
the
window
;
placidly
fan
herself
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ablewhite
stand
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
with
his
bald
head
much
pinker
than
I
have
ever
see
it
yet
,
and
address
himself
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
to
his
niece
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rachel
,
my
dear
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
have
hear
some
very
extraordinary
news
from
Godfrey

and
I
be
here
to
inquire
about
it

<EOS>
You
have
a
sit

room
of
your

Will
you
honour

me
the
way

it

<EOS>
Rachel
never
move
.
<EOS>
whether
she
be
determined
to
bring
matter
to
a
crisis
,
or
whether
she
be
prompt
by
some
private
sign
from
Mr.
Bruff
,
be
more
than
I
can
tell
.
<EOS>
She
decline
do
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
the
honour
of
conduct
him
into
her
sitting
-
room

<EOS>
"
whatever
you
wish

answer

<EOS>

just
as

say
the
amiable
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
He
take
a
chair
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
them
look
at
his
face
 
as
if
they
expect
it
,
after
seventy
year
of
worldly
training
,
to
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
top
of
his
bald
head
;
have
notice
on
other
occasion
that
the
temper
which
be
really
in
him
have
a
habit
of
register
itself
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
some
week
ago

in

to
what

make
no

<EOS>
the
error
be
evidently
in
what
he
tell
me
yesterday

<EOS>
I
begin
to
see
it
now
.
<EOS>
You

he
have
have
a

quarrel

my
foolish
son
have
interpret
it
seriously

<EOS>
the
self

register
thermometer
at
the
top
of
Mr.
Ablewhite

bald
head
begin
to
indicate
a
rise
of
temper

<EOS>
His
face
be
more
amiable

THERE
be
the
pink
at

a

deeper
already

the

<EOS>
She
speak
with
a
bitterness
of
tone
which
satisfy
me
that
the
scandal
of
the
Moonstone
have
be
in
some
way
recall
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
more

"
she
add
,
wearily
,
not
address
the
word
to
anyone
in
particular
,
and
look
away
from
us
all
,
out
of
the
window
that
be
near
to
her

<EOS>
Mr.
Ablewhite
get
upon
his
foot
,
and
push
away
his
chair
so
violently
that
it
topple
over
and
fall
on
the
floor

<EOS>
"
I
have
something
more

he
announce
,
bring
down
the
flat
of
his
hand
on
the
table
with
a
bang
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
say

I
do

<EOS>
Rachel
start
,
and
look
at
him
in
sudden
surprise

<EOS>
"
Insult

she
repeat

<EOS>
"
what
do

Insult

Mr.

<EOS>
"
I
know
your

I

<EOS>
Your

Her

their
back

I
be
not

from
a
set
of
cut

throat
scoundrel

<EOS>
I
could
not

to
the
time

Ablewhites
have
not
a

to
their
back

and
could
not
sign
their

come
to
the
pinch

Mr.

I
be
astonished

<EOS>
before
Mr.
Ablewhite
could
find
word
to
answer
in
,
Rachel
speak
in
a
tone
of
the
most
exasperating
contempt

<EOS>
"
surely

she
say
to
the

"
this
be

<EOS>
from
scarlet
,
Mr.
Ablewhite
be
now
become
purple
.
<EOS>
He
gasp
for
breath
;
he
look
backwards
and
forwards
from
Rachel
to
Mr.
Bruff
in
such
a
frenzy
of
rage
with
both
of
them
that
he
do
not
know
which
to
attack
first
.
<EOS>
His

who
have
sit
impenetrably

herself
up

begin
to
be
alarm
,
and
attempt
,
quite
uselessly
,
to
quiet
him

<EOS>
I
have
,
throughout
this
distressing
interview
,
feel
more
than
one
inward
call
to
interfere
with
a
few
earnest
word
,
and
have
control
myself
under
a
dread
of
the
possible
result
,
very
unworthy
of
a
Christian
Englishwoman
who
look
,
not
to
what
be
meanly
prudent
,
but
to
what
be
morally
right
.
<EOS>
at
the
point
at
which
matter
have
now
arrive
,
I
rise
superior
to
all
consideration
of
mere
expediency

<EOS>
if
I
have
contemplate
interpose
any
remonstrance
of
my
own
humble

I
may
possibly
have
still
hesitate

<EOS>
but
the
distress
domestic
emergency
which
now
confront
me

most
marvellously

beautifully

I
rise
in
my
modest
corner
,
and
I
open
my
precious
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
Mr.
Ablewhite
,
"
I
say
,
"
one
word
!
"
  
<EOS>
when
I
first
attract
the
attention
of
the
company
by
rise
,
I
could
see
that
he
be
on
the
point
of
say
something
rude
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
sisterly
form

check
him

<EOS>
He
stare
at

in
heathen
astonishment

fortify
other

permit
me
to
take
the
most
pardonable
of

liberty
 
the
liberty

<EOS>
He
begin
to
recover
himself
;
he
be
on
the
point
of
break
out
 
he
WOULD
have
break
out
,
with
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
but
my
voice
(
habitually
gentle
)
possess
a
high
note
or
so
,
in
emergency
.
<EOS>
in
this
emergency
,
I
feel
imperatively
call
upon
to
have
the
high
voice
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
I
hold
up
my
precious
book
before
him
;
I
rap
the
open
page
impressively
with
my
forefinger
.
"
<EOS>
not

"
I
exclaim
,
in
a
burst
of
fervent
interruption
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
I
be
stop
there
by
a
momentary
impediment
of
the
breath
.
<EOS>
before
I
could
recover
myself
,
this
monster
in
human
form
shout
out
furiously
,
  
"

Jane

Stamper

<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
write
the
awful
word
,
which
be
here
represent
by
a
blank

<EOS>
I
shriek
as
it
pass
his
lip

I
fly
to
my
little
bag
on
the
side
table
;
I
shake
out
all

I
seize
the

particular
tract
on
profane
swearing

<EOS>
;
I
hand
it
to
him
with
an
expression
of
agonised
entreaty
.
<EOS>
He
tear
it
in
two
,
and
throw
it
back
at
me
across
the
table
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
them
rise
in
alarm
,
not
know
what
may
happen
next
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
sit
down
again
in
my
corner
.
<EOS>
there
have
once
be
an
occasion
,
under
somewhat
similar
circumstance
,
when
Miss
Jane
Ann
Stamper
have
be
take
by
the
two
shoulder
and
turn
out
of
a
room
.
<EOS>
I
wait
,
inspire
by
HER
spirit
,
for
a
repetition
of
HER
martyrdom
.
  
<EOS>
but
no
 
it
be
not
to
be

<EOS>
His
wife
be
the
next
person

he
address
.
<EOS>
"

with
rage

impudent
fanatic

do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
before
Aunt
Ablewhite
could
say
a
word
,
Rachel
answer
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Clack

"
  
<EOS>
those
word
have
a
singular
effect
on
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
They
suddenly
change
him
from
a
man
in
a
state
of
red
-
hot
anger
to
a
man
in
a
state
of
icy
-
cold
contempt
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
to
everybody
that
Rachel
have
say
something
 
short
and
plain
as
her
answer
have
be
 
which
give
him
the
upper
hand
of
her

last

<EOS>

"

She
turn

haughtily

have
dread
he
would
do
,
when
he
ask
Mrs.
Ablewhite
for
Rachel

bonnet
and
shawl

<EOS>
before
I
could
interpose
a
word

Rachel
have
accept
his
invitation
in
the
warm
term

<EOS>
if
I
suffer
the
arrangement
thus
make
between

carry
out
 
if
she
once
pass
the
threshold
of
Mr.
Bruff

door
 
farewell
to
the
fond
hope
of
my
life
,
the
hope
of
bring
my
lost
sheep
back
to
the
fold
!
<EOS>
the
bare
idea
of
such
a
calamity
as
this
quite
overwhelm
me
.
<EOS>
I
cast
the
miserable
trammel
of
worldly
discretion
to
the
wind
,
and
speak
with
the
fervour
that
fill
me
,
in
the
word
that
come
first

her
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
Rachel

dear
Rachel

I

you
my

home
;
come
to
London
by
the
next
train

it
with
me

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
Rachel
look
at
me
with
a
cruel
astonishment
which
she
make
no
effort
to
conceal
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

very
kind
,
Drusilla

"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
hope
to
visit
you
whenever
I
happen
to
be
in
London

<EOS>
but
I
have
accept
Mr.
Bruff
's
invitation
,
and
I
think
it
will
be
good
,
for
the
present
,
if
I
remain
under
Mr.
Bruff
's
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

I
plead
.
<EOS>
"
I
can

Rachel
 
I

"
  
<EOS>
I
try
to
fold
her
in
my
arm
.
<EOS>
but
she
draw
back
.
<EOS>
My
fervour
do
not
communicate
itself
;
it
only
alarm
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
surely
,
"
she
say
,
"
this
be
a
very
unnecessary
display
of
agitation

<EOS>
I
do
not

it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I

say
Mr.

<EOS>
Their
hardness
 
their
hideous

worldly
hardness
 
revolt
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh

<EOS>
Rachel

I
burst
out

<EOS>
have
not

"
  
<EOS>
Rachel
advance
a
step
nearer
,
and
look
at
me
very
strangely
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

your

she
say

<EOS>
"
Miss
Clack

will
you

"
  
<EOS>
before
I
could
answer
,
Mr.
Bruff
come
forward
,
and
offer
his
arm
to
Rachel
,
try
to
lead
her
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
well
not

the
subject

my

he
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
Miss

have
well
not

herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
a
stock
or
a
stone
,
such
an
interference
as
this
must
have
rouse
me
into
testify
to
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
put
Mr.
Bruff
aside
indignantly
with
my
own
hand
,
and
,
in
solemn
and
suitable
language
,
I
state
the
view
with
which
sound
doctrine
do
not
scruple
to
regard
the
awful
calamity
of
die
unprepared
.
  
<EOS>
Rachel
start
back
from
me
 
<EOS>
I
blush
to
write
 
with
a
scream
of
horror
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
away
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
to
Mr.
Bruff
.
"
<EOS>
come
away

for
God
's

before

<EOS>
You
be
at

Mr.

you

the
poor
helpless

cry
at

grave
over
the
loss
of

<EOS>
and
that

<EOS>
Deaf
to
all
remonstrance
,
she
run
to
the
door

<EOS>
at
the

moment

approach
her
 
<EOS>
I
be
shocked
and
grieve
,
but
,
it
be
needless
to
say
,
not
offend

<EOS>
I
only
wish
to
say
to
her
,
"
May
your
hard
heart
be
soften

<EOS>
I
freely
forgive
you
!
"
<EOS>
She
pull
down
her
veil
,
and
tear
her
shawl
away
from
my
hand
,
and
,
hurry
out
,
shut
the
door
in

<EOS>
I

the
insult
with

Mr.

"
I

a

She

go
out

her

My
fair
friend
,
Miss
Clack
,
have
lay
down
the
pen
,
there
be
two
reason
for
my
take
it
up
next
,
in
my
turn
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
I
be
in
a
position
to
throw
the
necessary
light
on
certain
point
of
interest
which
have
thus
far
be
leave
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
have
her
own
private
reason
for
break
her
marriage
engagement
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
have
his
own
private
reason
for
withdraw
all
claim
to
the
hand
of
his
charming
cousin
 
<EOS>
and
I
discover
what
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
second
place
,
it
be
my
good
or
ill
fortune
,
I
hardly
know
which
,
to
find
myself
personally
involve
 
at
the
period
of
which
I
be
now
write
 
in
the
mystery
of
the
Indian
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
honour
of
an
interview
,
at
my
own
office
,
with
an
oriental
stranger
of
distinguished
manner
,
who
be
no
other
,
unquestionably
,
than
the
chief
of
the
three
Indians
.
<EOS>
add
to
this
,
that
I
meet
with
the
celebrated
traveller
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
the
day
afterwards
,
and
that
I
hold
a
conversation
with
him
on
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
,
which
have
a
very
important
bearing
on
later
event
.
<EOS>
and
there
you
have
the
statement
of
my
claim
to
fill
the
position
which
I
occupy
in
these
page
.
  
<EOS>
the
true
story
of
the
broken
marriage
engagement
come
first
in
point
of
time
,
and
must
therefore
take
the
first
place
in
the
present
narrative
.
<EOS>
trace
my
way
back
along
the
chain
of
event
,
from
one
end
to
the
other
,
I
find
it
necessary
to
open
the
scene
,
oddly
enough
as
you
will
think
,
at
the
bedside
of
my
excellent
client
and
friend
,
the
late
Sir
John
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
have
his
share
 
perhaps
rather
a
large
share
 
of
the
more
harmless
and
amiable
of
the
weakness
incidental
to
humanity
.
<EOS>
among
these
,
I
may
mention
as
applicable
to
the
matter
in
hand
,
an
invincible
reluctance
 
so
long
as
he
enjoy
his
usual
good
health
 
to
face
the
responsibility
of
make
his
will
.
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
exert
her
influence
to
rouse
him
to
a
sense
of
duty
in
this
matter
;
and
I
exert
my
influence
.
<EOS>
He
admit
the
justice
of
our
view
 
but
he
go
no
further
than
that
,
until
he
find
himself
afflict
with
the
illness
which
ultimately
bring
him
to
his
grave
.
<EOS>
then
,
I
be
send
for
at
last
,
to
take
my
client
's
instruction
on
the
subject
of
his
will
.
<EOS>
They
prove
to
be
the
simple
instruction
I
have
ever
receive
in
the
whole
of
my
professional
career
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
be
doze
,
when
I
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
rouse
himself
at
the
sight
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Bruff
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
sha'n't
be
very
long
about
this
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
will
go
to
sleep
again
.
"
<EOS>
He
look
on
with
great
interest
while
I
collect
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
.
"
<EOS>
be
you
ready
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
I
bow
and
take
a
dip
of
ink
,
and
wait
for
my
instruction
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
leave
everything
to
my
wife
,
"
say
Sir
John
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
.
"
<EOS>
He
turn
round
on
his
pillow
,
and
compose
himself
to
sleep
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
disturb
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
to
understand
,
"
I
ask
,
"
that
you
leave
the
whole
of
the
property

of
every
sort

description

of
which
you

absolutely

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

"
say
Sir

.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
,
I
put
it
shorter

<EOS>
why
can
not
you
put
it
shorter
,
and
let
me
go
to
sleep
again
?
<EOS>
everything
to
my
wife
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
property
be
entirely
at
his
own
disposal
,
and
be
of
two
kind
.
<EOS>
property
in
land
<EOS>
(
I
purposely
abstain
from
use
technical
language
)
,
and
property
in
money
.
<EOS>
in
the
majority
of
case
,
I
be
afraid
I
should
have
feel
it
<EOS>
my
duty
to
my
client
to
ask
him
to
reconsider
his
Will
.
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
Sir
John
,
I
know
Lady
Verinder
to
be
,
not
only
worthy
of
the
unreserved
trust
which
her
husband
have
place
in
her
(
all
good
wife
be
worthy
of
that
)
 
but
to
be
also
capable
of
properly
administer
a
trust
(
which
,
in
my
experience
of
the
fair
sex
,
not
one
in
a
thousand
of
them
be
competent
to
do
)
.
<EOS>
in
ten
minute
,
Sir
John
's
will
be
draw
,
and
execute
,
and
Sir
John
himself
,
good
man
,
be
finish
his
interrupted
nap
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
amply
justify
the
confidence
which
her
husband
have
place
in
her
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
day
of
her
widowhood
,
she
send
for
me
,
and
make
her
Will
.
<EOS>
the
view
she
take
of
her
position
be
so
thoroughly
sound
and
sensible
,
that
I
be
relieve
of
all
necessity
for
advise
her
.
<EOS>
My
responsibility
begin
and
end
with
shape
her
instruction
into
the
proper
legal
form
.
<EOS>
before
Sir
John
have
be
a
fortnight
in
his
grave
,
the
future
of
his
daughter
have
be
most
wisely
and
most
affectionately
provide
for
.
  
<EOS>
the
Will
remain
in
its
fireproof
box
at
my
office
,
through
more
year
than
I
like
to
reckon
up
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
the
summer
of
eighteen
hundred
and
forty
-
eight
that
I
find
occasion
to
look
at
it
again
under
very
melancholy
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
date
I
have
mention
,
the
doctor
pronounce
the
sentence
on
poor
Lady
Verinder
,
which
be
literally
a
sentence
of
death
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
first
person
whom
she
inform
of
her
situation
;
and
I
find
her
anxious
to
go
over
her
Will
again
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
improve
the
provision
relate
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
lapse
of
time
,
her
wish
in
regard
to
certain
minor
legacy
,
leave
to
different
relative
,
have
undergo
some
modification
;
and
it
become
necessary
to
add
three
or
four
codicil
to
the
original
document
.
<EOS>
have
do
this
at
once
,
for
fear
of
accident
,
I
obtain
her
ladyship
's
permission
to
embody
her
recent
instruction
in
a
second
Will
.
<EOS>
My
object
be
to
avoid
certain
inevitable
confusion
and
repetition
which
now
disfigure
the
original
document
,
and
which
,
to
own
the
truth
,
grate
sadly
on
my
professional
sense
of
the
fitness
of
thing
.
  
<EOS>
the
execution
of
this
second
Will
have
be
describe
by
Miss
Clack
,
who
be
so
obliging
as
to
witness
it
.
<EOS>
so
far
as
regard
Rachel
Verinder
's
pecuniary
interest
,
it
be
,
word
for
word
,
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
first
Will
.
<EOS>
the
only
change
introduce
relate
to
the
appointment
of
a
guardian
,
and
to
certain
provision
concern
that
appointment
,
which
be
make
under
my
advice
.
<EOS>

Lady
Verinder
's
death
,
the
Will
be
place
in
the
hand
of
my
proctor
to
be
"
prove
"
(
as
the
phrase
be
)
in
the
usual
way
.
  
<EOS>
in
about
three
week
from
that
time
 
as
well
as
I
can
remember
 
the
first
warning
reach
me
of
something
unusual
go
on
under
the
surface
.
<EOS>
I
happen
to
be
look
in
at
my
friend
the
proctor
's
office
,
and
I
observe
that
he
receive
me
with
an
appearance
of
great
interest
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
news
for
you
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
I
hear
at
doctor
'
common
this
morning
?
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
's
will
have
be
ask
for
,
and
examine
,
already
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
news
indeed
!
<EOS>
there
be
absolutely
nothing
which
could
be
contest
in
the
Will
;
and
there
be
nobody
I
could
think
of
who
have
the
slight
interest
in
examine
it
.
<EOS>
(
I
shall
perhaps
do
well
<EOS>
if
I
explain
in
this
place
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
few
people
who
do
not
know
it
already
,
that
the
law
allow
all
will
to
be
examine
at
doctor
'
Commons
by
anybody
who
apply
,
on
the
payment
of
a
shill
fee

)
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
who
ask
for
the
Will
?
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
the
clerk
have
no
hesitation
in
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Smalley
,
of
the
firm
of
Skipp
and
Smalley
,
ask
for
it
.
<EOS>
the
Will
have
not
be
copy
yet
into
the
great
Folio
register
.
<EOS>
so
there
be
no
alternative
but
to
depart
from
the
usual
course
,
and
to
let
him
see
the
original
document
.
<EOS>
He
look
it
over
carefully
,
and
make
a
note
in
his
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
have
you
any
idea
of
what
he
want
with
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
find
out
,
"
I
answer
,
"
before
I
be
a
day
old
.
"
<EOS>
with
that
I
go
back
at
once
to
my
own
office
.
  
<EOS>
if
any
other
firm
of
solicitor
have
be
concern
in
this
unaccountable
examination
of
my
deceased
client
's
Will
,
I
may
have
find
some
difficulty
in
make
the
necessary
discovery
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
hold
over
Skipp
and
Smalley
which
make
my
course
in
this
matter
a
comparatively
easy
one
.
<EOS>
My
common
-
law
clerk
(
a
most
competent
and
excellent
man
)
be
a
brother
of
Mr.
Smalley
's
;
and
,
owe
to
this
sort
of
indirect
connection
with
me
,
Skipp
and
Smalley
have
,
for
some
year
past
,
pick
up
the
crumb
that
fall
from
my
table
,
in
the
shape
of
case
bring
to
my
office
,
which
,
for
various
reason
,
I
do
not
think
it
worth
while
to
undertake
.
<EOS>
My
professional
patronage
be
,
in
this
way
,
of
some
importance
to
the
firm
.
<EOS>
I
intend
,
if
necessary
,
to
remind
them
of
that
patronage
,
on
the
present
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
I
get
back
<EOS>
I
speak
to
my
clerk
;
and
,
after
tell
him
what
have
happen
,
I
send
him
to
his
brother
's
office
,
"
with
Mr.
Bruff
's
compliment
,
and
he
would
be
glad
to
know
why
Messrs.
Skipp
and
Smalley
have
find
it
necessary
to
examine
Lady
Verinder
's
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
message
bring
Mr.
Smalley
back
to
my
office
in
company
with
his
brother
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledge
that
he
have
act
under
instruction
receive
from
a
client
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
put
it
to
me
,
whether
it
would
not
be
a
breach
of
professional
confidence
on
his
part
to
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
smart
discussion
upon
that
.
<EOS>
He
be
right
,
no
doubt
;
and
I
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
I
be
angry
and
suspicious
 
<EOS>
and
I
insist
on
know
more
.
<EOS>
bad
still
,
I
decline
to
consider
any
additional
information
offer
me
,
as
a
secret
place
in
my
keeping
:
I
claim
perfect
freedom
to
use
my
own
discretion
.
<EOS>
bad
even
than
that
,
I
take
an
unwarrantable
advantage
of
my
position
.
<EOS>
"
choose
,
sir
,
"
I
say
to
Mr.
Smalley
,
"
between
the
risk
of
lose
your
client
's
business
and
the
risk
of
lose
Mine
.
"
<EOS>
quite
indefensible
,
I
admit
 
an
act
of
tyranny
,
and
nothing
less
.
<EOS>
like
other
tyrant
,
I
carry
my
point
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Smalley
choose
his
alternative
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
He
smile
resignedly
,
and
give
up
the
name
of
his
client
:
  
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
enough
for
me
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
have
reach
this
point
in
my
narrative
,
it
now
become
necessary
to
place
the
reader
of
these
line
 
so
far
as
Lady
Verinder
's
will
be
concern
 
on
a
footing
of
perfect
equality
,
in
respect
of
information
,
with
myself
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
state
,
then
,
in
the
few
possible
word
,
that
Rachel
Verinder
have
nothing
but
a
life
-
interest
in
the
property
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
excellent
sense
,
and
my
long
experience
,
have
combine
to
relieve
her
of
all
responsibility
,
and
to
guard
her
from
all
danger
of
become
the
victim
in
the
future
of
some
needy
and
unscrupulous
man
.
<EOS>
neither
she
,
nor
her
husband
(
if
she
marry
)
,
could
raise
sixpence
,
either
on
the
property
in
land
,
or
on
the
property
in
money
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
the
house
in
London
and
in
Yorkshire
to
live
in
,
and
they
would
have
the
handsome
income
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
all
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
think
over
what
I
have
discover
,
I
be
sorely
perplex
what
to
do
next
.
  
<EOS>
hardly
a
week
have
pass
since
I
have
hear
(
to
my
surprise
and
distress
)
of
Miss
Verinder
's
propose
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
sincere
admiration
and
affection
for
her
;
and
I
have
be
inexpressibly
grieve
when
I
hear
that
she
be
about
to
throw
herself
away
on
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
here
be
the
man
 
whom
I
have
always
believe
to
be
a
smooth
-
tongued
impostor
 
justify
the
very
bad
that
I
have
think
of
him
,
and
plainly
reveal
the
mercenary
object
of
the
marriage
,
on
his
side
!
<EOS>
and
what
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
you
may
reply
 
<EOS>
the
thing
be
do
every
day
.
<EOS>
grant
,
my
dear
sir
.
<EOS>
but
would
you
think
of
it
quite
as
lightly
as
you
do
,
if
the
thing
be
do
(
let
us
say
)
with
your
own
sister
?
  
<EOS>
the
first
consideration
which
now
naturally
occur
to
me
be
this
.
<EOS>
Would
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
hold
to
his
engagement
,
after
what
his
lawyer
have
discover
for
him
?
  
<EOS>
It
depend
entirely
on
his
pecuniary
position
,
of
which
I
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
if
that
position
be
not
a
desperate
one
,
it
would
be
well
worth
his
while
to
marry
Miss
Verinder
for
her
income
alone
.
<EOS>
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
stand
in
urgent
need
of
realise
a
large
sum
by
a
give
time
,
then
Lady
Verinder
's
Will
would
exactly
meet
the
case
,
and
would
preserve
her
daughter
from
fall
into
a
scoundrel
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
latter
event
,
there
would
be
no
need
for
me
to
distress
Miss
Rachel
,
in
the
first
day
of
her
mourning
for
her
mother
,
by
an
immediate
revelation
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
in
the
former
event
,
if
I
remain
silent
,
I
should
be
connive
at
a
marriage
which
would
make
her
miserable
for
life
.
  
<EOS>
My
doubt
end
in
my
calling
at
the
hotel
in
London
,
at
which
I
know
Mrs.
Ablewhite
and
Miss
Verinder
to
be
stay
.
<EOS>
They
inform
me
that
they
be
go
to
Brighton
the
next
day
,
and
that
an
unexpected
obstacle
prevent
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
from
accompany
them
.
<EOS>
I
at
once
propose
to
take
his
place
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
only
think
of
Rachel
Verinder
,
it
be
possible
to
hesitate
.
<EOS>
when
I
actually
see
her
,
my
mind
be
make
up
directly
,
come
what
may
of
it
,
to
tell
her
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
my
opportunity
,
when
I
be
out
walk
with
her
,
on
the
day
after
my
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
speak
to
you
,
"
I
ask
,
"
about
your
marriage
engagement
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
,
indifferently
,
"
if
you
have
nothing
more
interesting
to
talk
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
forgive
an
old
friend
and
servant
of
your
family
,
Miss
Rachel
,
if
I
venture
on
ask
whether
your
heart
be
set
on
this
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
marry
in
despair
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
 
on
the
chance
of
drop
into
some
sort
of
stagnant
happiness
which
may
reconcile
me
to
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
strong
language
!
<EOS>
and
suggestive
of
something
below
the
surface
,
in
the
shape
of
a
romance
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
my
own
object
in
view
,
and
I
decline
(
as
we
lawyer
say
)
to
pursue
the
question
into
its
side
issue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
can
hardly
be
of
your
way
of
thinking
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
his
heart
must
be
set
on
the
marriage
at
any
rate
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
say
so
,
and
I
suppose
I
ought
to
believe
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
hardly
marry
me
,
after
what
I
have
own
to
him
,
unless
he
be
fond
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
the
bare
idea
of
a
man
marry
her
for
his
own
selfish
and
mercenary
end
have
never
enter
her
head
.
<EOS>
the
task
I
have
set
myself
begin
to
look
like
a
hard
task
than
I
have
bargain
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
sound
strangely
,
"
<EOS>
I
go
on
,
"
in
my
old
-
fashioned
ear
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
what
sound
strangely
?
"
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
hear
you
speak
of
your
future
husband
as
if
you
be
not
quite
sure
of
the
sincerity

his
attachment
.
<EOS>
be
you
conscious

any
reason
in
your
own
mind
for
doubt
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
astonishing
quickness
of
perception
,
detect
a
change
in
my
voice
,
or
my
manner
,
when
I
put
that
question
,
which
warn
her
that
I
have
be
speak
all
along
with
some
ulterior
object
in
view
.
<EOS>
She
stop
,
and
take
her
arm
out
of
mine
,
look
me
searchingly
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bruff
,
"
she
say
,
"
you
have
something
to
tell
me
about
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
tell
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
know
her
well
enough
to
take
her
at
her
word
.
<EOS>
I
tell
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
arm
again
into
mine
,
and
walk
on
with
me
slowly
.
<EOS>
I
feel
her
hand
tighten
its
grasp
mechanically
on
my
arm
,
and
I
see
her
get
paler
and
paler
as
I
go
on
 
<EOS>
but
,
not
a
word
pass
her
lip
while
I
be
speak
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
do
,
she
still
keep
silence
.
<EOS>
Her
head
droop
a
little
,
and
she
walk
by
my
side
,
unconscious
of
my
presence
,
unconscious
of
everything
about
her
;
lose
 
bury
<EOS>
,
I
may
almost
say
 
in
her
own
thought
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
attempt
to
disturb
her
.
<EOS>
My
experience
of
her
disposition
warn
me
,
on
this
,
as
on
former
occasion
,
to
give
her
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
instinct
of
girl
in
general
,
on
be
tell
of
anything
which
interest
them
,
be
to
ask
a
multitude
of
question
,
and
then
to
run
off
,
and
talk
it
all
over
with
some
favourite
friend
.
<EOS>
Rachel
Verinder
's
first
instinct
,
under
similar
circumstance
,
be
to
shut
herself
up
in
her
own
mind
,
and
to
think
it
over
by
herself
.
<EOS>
this
absolute
self
-
dependence
be
a
great
virtue
in
a
man
.
<EOS>
in
a
woman
it
have
a
serious
drawback
of
morally
separate
her
from
the
mass
of
her
sex
,
and
so
expose
her
to
misconstruction
by
the
general
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
strongly
suspect
myself
of
think
as
the
rest
of
the
world
think
in
this
matter
 
except
in
the
case
of
Rachel
Verinder
.
<EOS>
the
self
-
dependence
in
her
character
,
be
one
of
its
virtue
in
my
estimation
;
partly
,
no
doubt
,
because
I
sincerely
admire
and
like
her
;
partly
,
because
the
view
I
take
of
her
connexion
with
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
be
base
on
my
own
special
knowledge
of
her
disposition
.
<EOS>
badly
as
appearance
may
look
,
in
the
matter
of
the
Diamond
 
shocking
as
it
undoubtedly
be
to
know
that
she
be
associate
in
any
way
with
the
mystery
of
an
undiscovered
theft
 
<EOS>
I
be
satisfied
nevertheless
that
she
have
do
nothing
unworthy
of
her
,
because
I
be
also
satisfied
that
she
have
not
stir
a
step
in
the
business
,
without
shut
herself
up
in
her
own
mind
,
and
think
it
over
first
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
walk
on
,
for
nearly
a
mile
I
should
say
before
Rachel
rouse
herself
.
<EOS>
She
suddenly
look
up
at
me
with
a
faint
reflection
of
her
smile
of
happy
time
 
the
most
irresistible
smile
I
have
ever
see
on
a
woman
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
owe
much
already
to
your
kindness
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
feel
more
deeply
indebted
to
it
now
than
ever
.
<EOS>
if
you
hear
any
rumour
of
my
marriage
when
you
get
back
to
London
contradict
them
at
once

on
my
authority

you

My

you
be
very
young

you

find
more
difficulty
in
withdraw
from

whom
you
could
consult
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
one
,
"
she
answer
.
  
<EOS>
It
distress
me
<EOS>
,
it
do
indeed
distress
me
,
to
hear
her
say
that
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
young
and
so
lonely
 
<EOS>
and
she
bear
it
so
well
!
<EOS>
the
impulse
to
help
her
get
the
well
of
any
sense
of
my
own
unfitness
which
I
may
have
feel
under
the
circumstance
;
and
I
state
such
idea
on
the
subject
as
occur
to
me
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
to
the
good
of
my
ability
.
<EOS>
I
have
advise
a
prodigious
number
of
client
,
and
have
deal
with
some
exceedingly
awkward
difficulty
,
in
my
time
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
first
occasion
on
which
I
have
ever
find
myself
advise
a
young
lady
how
to
obtain
her
release
from
a
marriage
engagement
.
<EOS>
the
suggestion
I
offer
amount
briefly
to
this
.
<EOS>
I
recommend
her
to
tell
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
 
at
a
private
interview
,
of
course
 
that
he
have
,
to
her
certain
knowledge
,
betray
the
mercenary
nature
of
the
motive
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
She
be
then
to
add
that
their
marriage
,
after
what
she
have
discover
,
be
a
simple
impossibility
 
<EOS>
and
she
be
to
put
it
to
him
,
whether
he
think
it
wisest
to
secure
her
silence
by
fall
in
with
her
view
,
or
to
force
her
,
by
oppose
them
,
to
make
the
motive
under
which
she
be
act
generally
know
.
<EOS>
if
he
attempt
to
defend
himself
,
or
to
deny
the
fact
,
she
be
,
in
that
event
,
to
refer
him
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
listen
attentively
till
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
She
then
thank
me
very
prettily
for
my
advice
,
but
inform
me
at
the
same
time
that
it
be
impossible
for
her
to
follow
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
"
I
say
,
"
what
objection
you
see
to
follow
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
hesitate
 
and
then
meet
me
with
a
question
on
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
you
be
ask
to
express
your
opinion
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
conduct
?
<EOS>
"
she
begin
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
call
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
call
it
the
conduct
of
a
meanly
deceitful
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bruff
!
<EOS>
I
have
believe
in
that
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
promise
to
marry
that
man
.
<EOS>
how
can
I
tell
him
he
be
mean
<EOS>
,
how
can
I
tell
him
he
have
deceive
me
,
how
can
I
disgrace
him
in
the
eye
of
the
world
after
that
?
<EOS>
I
have
degrade
myself
by
ever
think
of
him
as
my
husband
.
<EOS>
if
I
say
what
you
tell
me
to
say
to
him
 
<EOS>
I
be
own
that
I
have
degrade
myself
to
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
after
what
have
pass
between
us
,
I
can
not
do
that
!
<EOS>
the
shame
of
it
would
be
nothing
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
shame
of
it
would
be
unendurable
to
_
me
_
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
be
another
of
the
marked
peculiarity
in
her
character
disclose
itself
to
me
without
reserve
.
<EOS>
here
be
her
sensitive
horror
of
the
bare
contact
with
anything
mean
,
blind
her
to
every
consideration
of
what
she
owe
to
herself
,
hurry
her
into
a
false
position
which
may
compromise
her
in
the
estimation
of
all
her
friend
!
<EOS>
up
to
this
time
,
I
have
be
a
little
diffident
about
the
propriety
of
the
advice
I
have
give
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
,
after
what
she
have
just
say
,
I
have
no
sort
of
doubt
that
it
be
the
good
advice
that
could
have
be
offer
;
and
I
feel
no
sort
of
hesitation
in
press
it
on
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
She
only
shake
her
head
,
and
repeat
her
objection
in
other
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
intimate
enough
with
me
to
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
have
stand
high
enough
in
my
estimation
to
obtain
my
consent
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
him
to
his
face
that
he
be
the
most
contemptible
of
living
creature
,
after
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
dear
Miss
Rachel
,
"
I
remonstrate
,
"
it
be
equally
impossible
for
you
to
tell
him
that
you
withdraw
from
your
engagement
without
give
some
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
say
that
I
have
think
it
over
,
and
that
I
be
satisfied
it
will
be
good
for
both
of
us
if
we
part
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
more
than
that
?
"
  
"
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
think
of
what
he
may
say
,
on
his
side
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
say
what
he
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
not
to
admire
her
delicacy
and
her
resolution
,
and
it
be
equally
impossible
not
to
feel
that
she
be
put
herself
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
entreat
her
to
consider
her
own
position
.
<EOS>
I
remind
her
that
she
would
be
expose
herself
to
the
most
odious
misconstruction
of
her
motive
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
brave
public
opinion
,
"
I
say
,
"
at
the
command
of
private
feeling
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
it
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
forget
the
Moonstone
,
Mr.
Bruff

have
I
not
brave
public
opinion
,
there
,
with
my
own
private
reason
for
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
answer
silence
me
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
It
set
me
try
to
trace
the
explanation
of
her
conduct
,
at
the
time
of
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
,
out
of
the
strange
avowal
which
have
just
escape
her
.
<EOS>
I
may
perhaps
have
do
it
when
I
be
young
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
could
not
do
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
I
try
a
last
remonstrance
before
we
return
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
be
just
as
immovable
as
ever
.
<EOS>
My
mind
be
in
a
strange
conflict
of
feeling
about
her
when
I
leave
her
that
day
.
<EOS>
She
be
obstinate
;
she
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
be
interesting
;
she
be
admirable
;
she
be
deeply
to
be
pity
.
<EOS>
I
make
her
promise
to
write
to
me
the
moment
she
have
any
news
to
send
.
<EOS>
and
I
go
back
to
my
business
in
London
,
with
a
mind
exceedingly
ill
at
ease
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
evening
of
my
return
,
before
it
be
possible
for
me
to
receive
my
promise
letter
,
I
be
surprised
by
a
visit
from
Mr.
Ablewhite
the
elder
,
and
be
inform
that
Mr.
Godfrey
have
get
his
dismissal
 
and
have
accept
<EOS>
it
 
<EOS>
that
very
day
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
view
I
already
take
of
the
case
,
the
bare
fact
state
in
the
word
that
I
have
underline
,
reveal
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
motive
for
submission
as
plainly
as
if
he
have
acknowledge
it
himself
.
<EOS>
He
need
a
large
sum
of
money
;
and
he
need
it
by
a
give
time
.
<EOS>
Rachel
's
income
,
which
would
have
help
him
to
anything
else
,
would
not
help
him
here
;
and
Rachel
have
accordingly
release
herself
,
without
encounter
a
moment
's
serious
opposition
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
tell
that
this
be
a
mere
speculation
,
I
ask
,
<EOS>
in
my
turn
,
what
other
theory
will
account
for
his
give
up
a
marriage
which
would
have
maintain
him
in
splendour
for
the
rest
of
his
life
?
  
<EOS>
any
exultation
I
may
otherwise
have
feel
at
the
lucky
turn
which
thing
have
now
take
,
be
effectually
check
by
what
pass
at
my
interview
with
old
Mr.
Ablewhite
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
,
of
course
,
to
know
whether
I
could
give
him
any
explanation
of
Miss
Verinder
's
extraordinary
conduct
.
<EOS>
It
be
needless
to
say
that
I
be
quite
unable
to
afford
him
the
information
he
want
.
<EOS>
the
annoyance
which
I
thus
inflict
,
follow
on
the
irritation
produce
by
a
recent
interview
with
his
son
,
throw
Mr.
Ablewhite
off
his
guard
.
<EOS>
both
his
look
and
his
language
convince
me
that
Miss
Verinder
would
find
him
a
merciless
man
to
deal
with
,
when
he
join
the
lady
at
Brighton
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
restless
night
,
consider
what
I
ought
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
how
my
reflection
end
,
and
how
thoroughly
well
found
my
distrust
of
Mr.
Ablewhite
<EOS>
prove
to
be
,
be
item
of
information
which
(
as
I
be
tell
)
have
already
be
put
tidily
in
their
proper
place
,
by
that
exemplary
person
,
Miss
Clack
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
add
 
in
completion
of
her
narrative
 
that
Miss
Verinder
find
the
quiet
and
repose
which
she
sadly
need
,
poor
thing
,
in
my
house
at
Hampstead
.
<EOS>
She
honour
us
by
make
a
long
stay
.
<EOS>
My
wife
and
daughter
be
charm
with
her
;
and
,
when
the
executor
decide
on
the
appointment
of
a
new
guardian
,
I
feel
sincere
pride
and
pleasure
in
record
that
my
guest
and
my
family
part
like
old
friend
,
on
either
side
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
thing
I
have
to
do
,
be
to
present
such
additional
information
as
I
possess
on
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
,
or
,
to
speak
more
correctly
,
on
the
subject
of
the
indian
plot
to
steal
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
the
little
that
I
have
to
tell
be
(
as
I
think
I
have
already
say
)
of
some
importance
,
nevertheless
,
in
respect
of
its
bearing
very
remarkably
on
event
which
be
still
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
about
a
week
or
ten
day
after
Miss
Verinder
have
leave
us
,
one
of
my
clerk
enter
the
private
room
at
my
office
,
with
a
card
in
his
hand
,
and
inform
me
that
a
gentleman
be
below
,
who
want
to
speak
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
card
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
foreign
name
write
on
it
,
which
have
escape
my
memory
.
<EOS>
It
be
follow
by
a
line
write
in
English
at
the
bottom
of
the
card
,
which
I
remember
perfectly
well
:
  
"
recommend
by
Mr.
Septimus
Luker
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
audacity
of
a
person
in
Mr.
Luker
's
position
presuming
to
recommend
anybody
to
me
,
take
me
so
completely
by
surprise
,
that
I
sit
silent
for
the
moment
,
wonder
whether
my
own
eye
have
not
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
the
clerk
,
observe
my
bewilderment
,
favour
me
with
the
result
of
his
own
observation
of
the
stranger
who
be
wait
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
rather
a
remarkable
-
looking
man
,
sir
.
<EOS>
so
dark
in
the
complexion
that
we
all
set
him
down
in
the
office
for
an
Indian
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
"
  
<EOS>
associate
the
clerk
's
idea
with
the
line
inscribe
on
the
card
in
my
hand
,
I
think
it
possible
that
the
Moonstone
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
Mr.
Luker
's
recommendation
,
and
of
the
stranger
's
visit
at
my
office
.
<EOS>
to
the
astonishment
of
my
clerk
,
I
at
once
decide
on
grant
an
interview
to
the
gentleman
below
.
  
<EOS>
in
justification
of
the
highly
unprofessional
sacrifice
to
mere
curiosity
which
I
thus
make
,
permit
me
to
remind
anybody
who
may
read
these
line
,
that
no
live
person
(
in
England
,
at
any
rate
)
can
claim
to
have
have
such
an
intimate
connexion
with
the
romance
of
the
Indian
Diamond
as
mine
have
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
trust
with
the
secret
of
Colonel
Herncastle
's
plan
for
escape
assassination
.
<EOS>
I
receive
the
Colonel
's
letter
,
periodically
report
himself
a
live
man
.
<EOS>
I
draw
his
will
,
leave
the
Moonstone
to
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
I
persuade
his
executor
to
act
,
on
the
chance
that
the
jewel
may
prove
to
be
a
valuable
acquisition
to
the
family
.
<EOS>
and
,
lastly
,
I
combat
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
's
scruple
,
and
induce
him
to
be
the
mean
of
transport
the
Diamond
to
Lady
Verinder
's
house
.
<EOS>
if
anyone
can
claim
a
prescriptive
right
of
interest
in
the
Moonstone
,
and
in
everything
connect
with
it
,
I
think
it
be
hardly
to
be
deny
that
I
be
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
my
mysterious
client
be
show
in
,
I
feel
an
inner
conviction
that
I
be
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
three
Indians
 
probably
of
the
chief
.
<EOS>
He
be
carefully
dress
in
european
costume
.
<EOS>
but
his
swarthy
complexion
,
his
long
lithe
figure
,
and
his
grave
and
graceful
politeness
of
manner
be
enough
to
betray
his
oriental
origin
to
any
intelligent
eye
that
look
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
point
to
a
chair
,
and
beg
to
be
inform
of
the
nature
of
his
business
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
after
first
apologise
 
in
an
excellent
selection
of
english
word
 
for
the
liberty
which
he
have
take
in
disturb
me
,
the
Indian
produce
a
small
parcel
the
outer
covering
of
which
be
of
cloth
of
gold
.
<EOS>
remove
this
and
a
second
wrapping
of
some
silken
fabric
,
he
place
a
little
box
,
or
casket
,
on
my
table
,
most
beautifully
and
richly
inlay
in
jewel
,
on
an
ebony
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
,
sir
,
"
he
say
,
"
to
ask
you
to
lend
me
some
money
.
<EOS>
and
I
leave
this
as
an
assurance
to
you
that
my
debt
will
be
pay
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
point
to
his
card
.
"
<EOS>
and
you
apply
to
me
,
"
I
rejoin
,
"
at
Mr.
Luker
's
recommendation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
Indian
bow
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
how
it
be
that
Mr.
Luker
himself
do
not
advance
the
money
that
you
require
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Luker
inform
me
,
sir
,
that
he
have
no
money
to
lend
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
so
he
recommend
you
to
come
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
Indian
,
in
his
turn
,
point
to
the
card
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
write
there
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
Briefly
answer
,
and
thoroughly
to
the
purpose
!
<EOS>
if
the
Moonstone
have
be
in
my
possession
,
this
oriental
gentleman
would
have
murder
me
,
I
be
well
aware
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
and
bar
that
slight
drawback
,
I
be
bind
to
testify
that
he
be
the
perfect
model
of
a
client
.
<EOS>
He
may
not
have
respect
my
life
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
what
none
of
my
own
countryman
have
ever
do
,
in
all
my
experience
of
them
 
he
respect
my
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
,
"
I
say
,
"
that
you
should
have
have
the
trouble
of
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
be
quite
mistaken
in
send
you
here
.
<EOS>
I
be
trust
,
like
other
man
in
my
profession
,
with
money
to
lend
.
<EOS>
but
I
never
lend
it
to
stranger
,
and
I
never
lend
it
on
such
a
security
as
you
have
produce
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
far
from
attempt
,
as
other
people
would
have
do
,
to
induce
me
to
relax
my
own
rule
,
the
Indian
only
make
me
another
bow
,
and
wrap
up
his
box
in
its
two
covering
without
a
word
of
protest
.
<EOS>
He
rise
 
this
admirable
assassin
rise
to
go
,
the
moment
I
have
answer
him
!
  
<EOS>
"
Will
your
condescension
towards
a
stranger
,
excuse
my
ask
one
question
,
"
he
say
,
"
before
I
take
my
leave
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bow
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
only
one
question
at
parting
!
<EOS>
the
average
in
my
experience
be
fifty
.
  
<EOS>
"
supposing
,
sir
,
it
have
be
possible
(
and
customary
)
for
you
to
lend
me
the
money
,
"
he
say
,
"
in
what
space
of
time
would
it
have
be
possible
(
and
customary
)
for
me
to
pay
it
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
accord
to
the
usual
course
pursue
in
this
country
,
"
I
answer
,
"
you
would
have
be
entitle
to
pay
the
money
back
(
if
you
like
)
in
one
year
's
time
from
the
date
at
which
it
be
first
advanced
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Indian
make
me
a
last
bow
,
the
low
of
all
 
and
suddenly
and
softly
walk
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
do
in
a
moment
,
in
a
noiseless
,
supple
,
cat
-
like
way
,
which
a
little
startle
me
,
I
own
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
be
compose
enough
to
think
,
I
arrive
at
one
distinct
conclusion
in
reference
to
the
otherwise
incomprehensible
visitor
who
have
favour
me
with
a
call
.
  
<EOS>
His
face
,
voice
,
and
manner
 
while
I
be
in
his
company
 
be
under
such
perfect
control
that
they
set
all
scrutiny
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
give
me
one
chance
of
look
under
the
smooth
outer
surface
of
him
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
show
the
slight
sign
of
attempt
to
fix
anything
that
I
have
say
to
him
in
his
mind
,
until
I
mention
the
time
at
which
it
be
customary
to
permit
the
early
repayment
,
on
the
part
of
a
debtor
,
of
money
that
have
be
advance
as
a
loan
.
<EOS>
when
I
give
him
that
piece
of
information
,
he
look
me
straight
in
the
face
,
while
I
be
speak
,
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
the
inference
I
draw
from
this
be
 
that
he
have
a
special
purpose
in
ask
me
his
last
question
,
and
a
special
interest
in
hear
my
answer
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
more
carefully
I
reflect
on
what
have
pass
between
us
,
the
more
shrewdly
I
suspect
the
production
of
the
casket
,
and
the
application
for
the
loan
,
of
have
be
mere
formality
,
design
to
pave
the
way
for
the
part
inquiry
address
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
satisfy
myself
of
the
correctness
of
this
conclusion
 
and
be
try
to
get
on
a
step
further
,
and
penetrate
the
Indian
's
motive
next
 
when
a
letter
be
bring
to
me
,
which
prove
to
be
from
no
less
a
person
that
Mr.
Septimus
Luker
himself
.
<EOS>
He
ask
my
pardon
in
term
of
sickening
servility
,
and
assure
me
that
he
could
explain
matter
to
my
satisfaction
,
if
I
would
honour
him
by
consent
to
a
personal
interview
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
another
unprofessional
sacrifice
to
mere
curiosity
.
<EOS>
I
honour
him
by
make
an
appointment
at
my
office
,
for
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
be
,
in
every
respect
,
such
an
inferior
creature
to
the
indian
 
<EOS>
he
be
so
vulgar
,
so
ugly
,
so
cringe
,
and
so
prosy
 
that
he
be
quite
unworthy
of
be
report
,
at
any
length
,
in
these
page
.
<EOS>
the
substance
of
what
he
have
to
tell
me
may
be
fairly
state
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
the
day
before
I
have
receive
the
visit
of
the
indian
,
Mr.
Luker
have
be
favour
with
a
call
from
that
accomplished
gentleman
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
his
european
disguise
,
Mr.
Luker
have
instantly
identify
his
visitor
with
the
chief
of
the
three
Indians
,
who
have
formerly
annoy
him
by
loiter
about
his
house
,
and
who
have
leave
him
no
alternative
but
to
consult
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
from
this
startling
discovery
he
have
rush
to
the
conclusion
(
naturally
enough
I
own
)
that
he
must
certainly
be
in
the
company
of
one
of
the
three
man
,
who
have
blindfold
him
,
gag
him
,
and
rob
him
of
his
banker
's
receipt
.
<EOS>
the
result
be
that
he
become
quite
paralysed
with
terror
,
and
that
he
firmly
believe
his
last
hour
have
come
.
  
<EOS>
on
his
side
,
the
Indian
preserve
the
character
of
a
perfect
stranger
.
<EOS>
He
produce
the
little
casket
,
and
make
exactly
the
same
application
which
he
have
afterwards
make
to
me
.
<EOS>
as
the
speedy
way
of
get
rid
of
him
,
Mr.
Luker
have
at
once
declare
that
he
have
no
money
.
<EOS>
the
Indian
have
thereupon
ask
to
be
inform
of
the
good
and
safe
person
to
apply
to
for
the
loan
he
want
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
have
answer
that
the
good
and
safe
person
,
in
such
case
,
be
usually
a
respectable
solicitor
.
<EOS>
ask
to
name
some
individual
of
that
character
and
profession
,
Mr.
Luker
have
mention
me
 
for
the
one
simple
reason
that
,
in
the
extremity
of
his
terror
,
mine
be
the
first
name
which
occur
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
the
perspiration
be
pour
off
me
like
rain
,
sir
,
"
the
wretched
creature
conclude
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
I
be
talk
about
.
<EOS>
and
I
hope
you
will
look
over
it
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
sir
,
in
consideration
of
my
have
be
really
and
truly
frighten
out
of
my
wit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
excuse
the
fellow
graciously
enough
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
readiest
way
of
release
myself
from
the
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
before
he
leave
me
,
I
detain
him
to
make
one
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
have
the
Indian
say
anything
noticeable
,
at
the
moment
of
quit
Mr.
Luker
's
house
?
  
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
the
Indian
have
put
precisely
the
same
question
to
Mr.
Luker
,
at
parting
,
which
he
have
put
to
me
;
receive
of
course
,
the
same
answer
as
the
answer
which
I
have
give
him
.
  
<EOS>
what
do
it
mean
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
's
explanation
give
me
no
assistance
towards
solve
the
problem
.
<EOS>
My
own
unaided
ingenuity
,
consult
next
,
prove
quite
unequal
to
grapple
with
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
dinner
engagement
that
evening
;
and
I
go
upstairs
,
in
no
very
genial
frame
of
mind
,
little
suspect
that
the
way
to
my
dressing
-
room
and
the
way
to
discovery
,
mean
,
on
this
particular
occasion
,
<EOS>
one
and
the
same
thing
.
    
<EOS>
the
prominent
personage
among
the
guest
at
the
dinner
party
I
find
to
be
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
  
<EOS>
on
his
appearance
in
England
,
after
his
wandering
,
society
have
be
greatly
interested
in
the
traveller
,
as
a
man
who
have
pass
through
many
dangerous
adventure
,
and
who
have
escape
to
tell
the
tale
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
announce
his
intention
of
return
to
the
scene
of
his
exploit
,
and
of
penetrate
into
region
leave
still
unexplored
.
<EOS>
this
magnificent
indifference
to
place
his
safety
in
peril
for
the
second
time
,
revive
the
flagging
interest
of
the
worshipper
in
the
hero
.
<EOS>
the
law
of
chance
be
clearly
against
his
escaping
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
every
day
that
we
can
meet
an
eminent
person
at
dinner
,
and
feel
that
there
be
a
reasonable
prospect
of
the
news
of
his
murder
be
the
news
that
we
hear
of
him
next
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
gentleman
be
leave
by
themselves
in
the
dining
-
room
,
I
find
myself
sit
next
to
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
the
guest
present
be
all
English
,
it
be
needless
to
say
that
,
as
soon
as
the
wholesome
check
exercise
by
the
presence
of
the
lady
be
remove
,
the
conversation
turn
on
politic
as
a
necessary
result
.
  
<EOS>
in
respect
to
this
all
-
absorb
national
topic
,
I
happen
to
be
one
of
the
most
un
-
English
Englishmen
live
.
<EOS>
as
a
general
rule
,
political
talk
appear
to
me
to
be
of
all
talk
the
most
dreary
and
the
most
profitless
.
<EOS>
glance
at
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
when
the
bottle
have
make
their
first
round
of
the
table
,
I
find
that
he
be
apparently
of
my
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
He
be
do
it
very
dexterously
 
with
all
possible
consideration
for
the
feeling
of
his
host
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
the
less
certain
that
he
be
compose
himself
for
a
nap
.
<EOS>
It
strike
me
as
an
experiment
worth
attempt
,
to
try
whether
a
judicious
allusion
to
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
would
keep
him
awake
,
and
,
if
it
do
,
to
see
what
he
think
of
the
last
new
complication
in
the
indian
conspiracy
,
as
reveal
in
the
prosaic
precinct
of
my
office
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
"
I
begin
,
"
you
be
acquaint
with
the
late
Lady
Verinder
,
and
you
take
some
interest
in
the
strange
succession
of
event
which
end
in
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
eminent
traveller
do
me
the
honour
of
wake
up
in
an
instant
,
and
ask
me
who
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
inform
him
of
my
professional
connection
with
the
Herncastle
family
,
not
forget
the
curious
position
which
I
have
occupy
towards
the
Colonel
and
his
Diamond
in
the
bygone
time
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
shift
round
in
his
chair
,
so
as
to
put
the
rest
of
the
company
behind
him
(
Conservatives
and
Liberals
alike
)
,
and
concentrate
his
whole
attention
on
plain
Mr.
Bruff
,
of
Gray
's
Inn
Square
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
hear
anything
,
lately
,
of
the
Indians
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
every
reason
to
believe
,
"
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
that
one
of
them
have
an
interview
with
me
,
in
my
office
,
yesterday
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
be
not
an
easy
man
to
astonish
;
but
that
last
answer
of
mine
completely
stagger
him
.
<EOS>
I
describe
what
have
happen
to
Mr.
Luker
,
and
what
have
happen
to
myself
,
exactly
as
I
have
describe
it
here
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
clear
that
the
Indian
's
parting
inquiry
have
an
object
,
"
I
add
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
he
be
so
anxious
to
know
the
time
at
which
a
borrower
of
money
be
usually
privileged
to
pay
the
money
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
possible
that
you
do
not
see
his
motive
,
Mr.
Bruff
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
ashamed
of
my
stupidity
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
 
<EOS>
but
I
certainly
do
not
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
great
traveller
become
quite
interested
in
sound
the
immense
vacuity
of
my
dulness
to
its
low
depth
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
ask
you
one
question
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
in
what
position
do
the
conspiracy
to
seize
the
Moonstone
now
stand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
the
indian
plot
be
a
mystery
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
indian
plot
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
can
only
be
a
mystery
to
you
,
because
you
have
never
seriously
examine
it
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
run
it
over
together
,
from
the
time
when
you
draw
Colonel
Herncastle
's
will
,
to
the
time
when
the
Indian
call
at
your
office
?
<EOS>
in
your
position
,
it
may
be
of
very
serious
importance
to
the
interest
of
Miss
Verinder
,
that
you
should
be
able
to
take
a
clear
view
of
this
matter
in
case
of
need
.
<EOS>
tell
me
,
bear
that
in
mind
,
whether
you
will
penetrate
the
Indian
's
motive
for
yourself
?
<EOS>
or
whether
you
wish
me
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
make
any
inquiry
into
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
needless
to
say
that
I
thoroughly
appreciate
the
practical
purpose
which
I
now
see
that
he
have
in
view
,
and
that
the
first
of
the
two
alternative
be
the
alternative
I
choose
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
"
say
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
take
the
question
of
the
age
of
the
three
Indians
first
.
<EOS>
I
can
testify
that
they
all
look
much
about
the
same
age
 
and
you
can
decide
for
yourself
,
whether
the
man
whom
you
see
be
,
or
be
not
,
in
the
prime
of
life
.
<EOS>
not
forty
,
you
think
?
<EOS>
My
idea
too
.
<EOS>
We
will
say
not
forty
.
<EOS>
now
look
back
to
the
time
when
Colonel
Herncastle
come
to
England
,
and
when
you
be
concern
in
the
plan
he
adopt
to
preserve
his
life
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
you
to
count
the
year
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
say
,
it
be
clear
that
these
present
Indians
,
at
their
age
,
must
be
the
successor
of
three
other
Indians
(
high
caste
Brahmins
all
of
them
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
when
they
leave
their
native
country
!
)
<EOS>
who
follow
the
Colonel
to
these
shore
.
<EOS>
very
well
.
<EOS>
these
present
man
of
our
have
succeed
to
the
man
who
be
here
before
them
.
<EOS>
if
they
have
only
do
that
,
the
matter
would
not
have
be
worth
inquire
into
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
do
more
.
<EOS>
They
have
succeed
to
the
organisation
which
their
predecessor
establish
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
do
not
start
!
<EOS>
the
organisation
be
a
very
trumpery
affair
,
accord
to
our
idea
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
should
reckon
it
up
as
include
the
command
of
money
;
<EOS>
the
service
,
when
need
,
of
that
shady
sort
of
Englishman
,
who
live
in
the
byway
of
foreign
life
in
London
;
and
,
lastly
,
the
secret
sympathy
of
such
few
man
of
their
own
country
,
and
(
formerly
,
at
least
)
of
their
own
religion
,
as
happen
to
be
employ
in
minister
to
some
of
the
multitudinous
want
of
this
great
city
.
<EOS>
nothing
very
formidable
,
as
you
see
!
<EOS>
but
worth
notice
at
starting
,
because
we
may
find
occasion
to
refer
to
this
modest
little
indian
organisation
as
we
go
on
.
<EOS>
have
now
clear
the
ground
,
I
be
go
to
ask
you
a
question
;
and
I
expect
your
experience
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
event
which
give
the
Indians
their
first
chance
of
seize
the
Diamond
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
understand
the
allusion
to
my
experience
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
first
chance
they
get
,
"
I
reply
,
"
be
clearly
offer
to
them
by
Colonel
Herncastle
's
death
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
aware
of
his
death
,
I
suppose
,
as
a
matter
of
course
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
and
his
death
,
as
you
say
,
give
them
their
first
chance
.
<EOS>
up
to
that
time
the
Moonstone
be
safe
in
the
strong
-
room
of
the
bank
.
<EOS>
You
draw
the
Colonel
's
will
leave
his
jewel
to
his
niece
;
and
the
Will
be
prove
in
the
usual
way
.
<EOS>
as
a
lawyer
,
you
can
be
at
no
loss
to
know
what
course
the
Indians
would
take
(
under
english
advice
)
after
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
would
provide
themselves
with
a
copy
of
the
Will
from
doctor
'
Commons
,
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exactly
.
<EOS>
one
or
other
of
those
shady
Englishmen
to
whom
I
have
allude
,
would
get
them
the
copy
you
have
describe
.
<EOS>
that
copy
would
inform
them
that
the
Moonstone
be
bequeath
to
the
daughter
of
Lady
Verinder
,
and
that
Mr.
Blake
the
elder
,
or
some
person
appoint
by
him
,
be
to
place
it
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
You
will
agree
with
me
that
the
necessary
information
about
person
in
the
position
of
Lady
Verinder
and
Mr.
Blake
,
would
be
perfectly
easy
information
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
the
one
difficulty
for
the
Indians
would
be
to
decide
whether
they
should
make
their
attempt
on
the
Diamond
when
it
be
in
course
of
removal
from
the
keeping
of
the
bank
,
or
whether
they
should
wait
until
it
be
take
down
to
Yorkshire
to
Lady
Verinder
's
house
.
<EOS>
the
second
way
would
be
manifestly
the
safe
way
 
<EOS>
and
there
you
have
the
explanation
of
the
appearance
of
the
Indians
at
Frizinghall
,
disguise
as
juggler
,
and
wait
their
time
.
<EOS>
in
London
,
it
be
needless
to
say
,
they
have
their
organisation
at
their
disposal
to
keep
them
inform
of
event
.
<EOS>
two
man
would
do
it
.
<EOS>
one
to
follow
anybody
who
go
from
Mr.
Blake
's
house
to
the
bank
.
<EOS>
and
one
to
treat
the
low
man
servant
with
beer
,
and
to
hear
the
news
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
these
commonplace
precaution
would
readily
inform
them
that
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
have
be
to
the
bank
,
and
that
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
be
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
be
go
to
visit
Lady
Verinder
.
<EOS>
what
actually
follow
upon
that
discovery
,
you
remember
,
no
doubt
,
quite
as
correctly
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
remember
that
Franklin
Blake
have
detect
one
of
the
spy
,
in
the
street
 
that
he
have
,
in
consequence
,
advance
the
time
of
his
arrival
in
Yorkshire
by
some
hour
 
and
that
(
thank
to
old
Betteredge
's
excellent
advice
)
<EOS>
he
have
lodge
the
Diamond
in
the
bank
at
Frizinghall
,
before
the
Indians
be
so
much
as
prepare
to
see
him
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
all
perfectly
clear
so
far
.
<EOS>
but
the
Indians
be
ignorant
of
the
precaution
thus
take
,
how
be
it
that
they
have
make
no
attempt
on
Lady
Verinder
's
house
(
in
which
they
must
have
suppose
the
Diamond
to
be
)
through
the
whole
of
the
interval
that
elapse
before
Rachel
's
birthday
?
  
<EOS>
in
put
this
difficulty
to
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
I
think
it
right
to
add
that
I
have
hear
of
the
little
boy
,
and
the
drop
of
ink
,
and
the
rest
of
it
,
and
that
any
explanation
base
on
the
theory
of
clairvoyance
be
an
explanation
which
would
carry
no
conviction
<EOS>
whatever
with
it
,
to
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
nor
to
mine
either
,
"
say
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
"
the
clairvoyance
in
this
case
be
simply
a
development
of
the
romantic
side
of
the
indian
character
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
refreshment
and
an
encouragement
to
those
man
 
quite
inconceivable
,
I
grant
you
,
to
the
english
mind
 
to
surround
their
wearisome
and
perilous
errand
in
this
country
with
a
certain
halo
of
the
marvellous
and
the
supernatural
.
<EOS>
Their
boy
be
unquestionably
a
sensitive
subject
to
the
mesmeric
influence
 
<EOS>
and
,
under
that
influence
,
he
have
no
doubt
reflect
what
be
already
in
the
mind
of
the
person
mesmerise
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
test
the
theory
of
clairvoyance
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
never
find
the
manifestation
get
beyond
that
point
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
do
not
investigate
the
matter
in
this
way
;
the
Indians
look
upon
their
boy
as
a
Seer
of
thing
invisible
to
their
eye
 
<EOS>
and
,
I
repeat
,
<EOS>
in
that
marvel
they
find
the
source
of
a
new
interest
in
the
purpose
that
unite
them
.
<EOS>
I
only
notice
this
as
offer
a
curious
view
of
human
character
,
which
must
be
quite
new
to
you
.
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
clairvoyance
,
or
with
mesmerism
,
or
with
anything
else
that
be
hard
of
belief
to
a
practical
man
,
in
the
inquiry
that
we
be
now
pursue
.
<EOS>
My
object
in
follow
the
indian
plot
,
step
by
step
,
be
to
trace
result
back
,
by
rational
mean
,
to
natural
cause
.
<EOS>
have
I
succeed
to
your
satisfaction
so
far
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
a
doubt
of
it
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
!
<EOS>
I
be
wait
,
however
,
with
some
anxiety
,
to
hear
the
rational
explanation
of
the
difficulty
which
I
have
just
have
the
honour
of
submit
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
smile
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
easy
difficulty
to
deal
with
of
all
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
permit
me
to
begin
by
admit
your
statement
of
the
case
as
a
perfectly
correct
one
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
be
undoubtedly
not
aware
of
what
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
have
do
with
the
Diamond
 
<EOS>
for
we
find
them
make
their
first
mistake
,
on
the
first
night
of
Mr.
Blake
's
arrival
at
his
aunt
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Their
first
mistake
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
!
<EOS>
the
mistake
of
allow
themselves
to
be
surprised
,
lurk
about
the
terrace
at
night
,
by
Gabriel
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
have
the
merit
of
see
for
themselves
that
they
have
take
a
false
step
 
for
,
as
you
say
,
again
,
with
plenty
of
time
at
their
disposal
,
they
never
come
near
the
house
for
week
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
?
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
want
to
know
!
<EOS>
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
no
Indian
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
ever
run
an
unnecessary
risk
.
<EOS>
the
clause
you
draw
in
Colonel
Herncastle
's
will
,
inform
them
(
do
not
it
?
)
<EOS>
that
the
Moonstone
be
to
pass
absolutely
into
Miss
Verinder
's
possession
on
her
birthday
.
<EOS>
very
well
.
<EOS>
tell
me
which
be
the
safe
course
for
man
in
their
position
?
<EOS>
to
make
their
attempt
on
the
Diamond
while
it
be
under
the
control
of
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
who
have
show
already
that
he
could
suspect
and
outwit
them
?
<EOS>
or
to
wait
till
the
Diamond
be
at
the
disposal
of
a
young
girl
,
who
would
innocently
delight
in
wear
the
magnificent
jewel
at
every
possible
opportunity
?
<EOS>
perhaps
you
want
a
proof
that
my
theory
be
correct
?
<EOS>
take
the
conduct
of
the
Indians
themselves
as
the
proof
.
<EOS>
They
appear
at
the
house
,
after
wait
all
those
week
,
on
Miss
Verinder
's
birthday
;
and
they
be
reward
for
the
patient
accuracy
of
their
calculation
by
see
the
Moonstone
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
!
<EOS>
when
I
hear
the
story
of
the
Colonel
and
the
Diamond
,
later
in
the
evening
,
I
feel
so
sure
about
the
risk
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
have
run
<EOS>
(
they
would
have
certainly
attack
him
,
if
he
have
not
happen
to
ride
back
to
Lady
Verinder
be
in
the
company
of
other
people
)
;
and
I
be
so
strongly
convinced
of
the
bad
risk
<EOS>
still
,
in
store
for
Miss
Verinder
,
that
I
recommend
follow
the
Colonel
's
plan
,
and
destroy
the
identity
of
the
gem
by
have
it
cut
into
separate
stone
.
<EOS>
how
its
extraordinary
disappearance
that
night
,
make
my
advice
useless
,
and
utterly
defeat
the
Hindoo
plot
 
and
how
all
further
action
on
the
part
of
the
Indians
be
paralyse
the
next
day
by
their
confinement
in
prison

rogue

vagabond

well

I
do

first
act

conspiracy

there

before
we
go
on
to
the
second

may
I
ask
whether
I
have
meet
your
difficulty
,
with
an
explanation
which
be
satisfactory
to
the
mind
of
a
practical
man
?

<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
deny
that
he
have
meet
my
difficulty
fairly
;
thank
to
his
superior
knowledge
of
the
indian
character
 
and
thank

his
not

will

time

good

first
chance

at
the
time

<EOS>
a
day
or
two
before
the
Indians
be
set
free
(
on
a
Monday
,
I
think
)
,
the
governor
of
the
prison
come
to
me
with
a
letter
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
leave
for
the
Indians
by
one
Mrs.
Macann

of
whom
they
have
hire
the
lodging

it
have

deliver
at
Mrs.
Macann
's
door
,
in

course

post
,
on
the
previous
morning
.
<EOS>
the
prison
authority
have
notice
that
the
postmark
be
"
Lambeth
,
"
and
that
the
address
on
the
outside
,
though
express
in
correct
English
,
be
,
in
form
,
oddly
at
variance
with
the
customary
method
of
direct
a
letter
.
<EOS>
on
open
it
,
they
have
find
the
content
to
be
write
in
a
foreign
language
,
which
they
rightly
guess
at
as
Hindustani
.
<EOS>
Their
object
in
come
to
me
be
,
of
course
,
to
have
the
letter
translate
to
them

take
a
copy
in
my
pocket

original
,

translation

there
they

He
hand
me
the
open
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
the
address
on
the
letter
be
the
first
thing
copy
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
write
in
one
paragraph
,
without
any
attempt
at
punctuation
,
thus
:
"
to
the
three

<EOS>
the
Hindoo
character

;
and
the
english
translation
appear
at
the
end
,
express
in
these
mysterious
word
:
  
"
<EOS>
in
the
name
of
the
regent
of
the
Night
,
whose
seat
be
on
the
Antelope
,
whose
arm
embrace
the
four
corner
of
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
"
brother
,
turn
your
face
to
the
south
,
and
come
to
me
in
the
street
of
many
noise
,
which
lead
down
to
the
muddy
river

the
reason
be
this

"
My
own
eye

it

the
letter
end
,
without
either
date
or
signature
.

I
hand
it
back
to
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
and
own
that
this
curious
speciman
of
Hindoo
correspondence
rather
puzzle
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
explain
the
first
sentence
to
you
,
"
he
say
;
"
and
the
conduct
of
the
Indians
themselves
will
explain
the
rest

<EOS>
the
god
of
the
moon
be
represent
,
in
the
Hindoo
mythology
,
as
a
four
-
armed
deity
,
seat
on
an
antelope
;
and
one
of
his
title
be
the
regent
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
here
,
then
,
to
begin
with
,
be
something
which
look
suspiciously
like
an
indirect
reference
to
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
now
,
let
us
see
what
the
Indians
do
,
after
the
prison
authority
have
allow
them
to
receive
their
letter
.
<EOS>
on
the
very
day
when
they
be
set
free
they
go
at
once
to
the
railway
station
,
and
take
their
place
in
the
first
train
that
start
for
London
.
<EOS>
We
all
think
it
a
pity
at
Frizinghall
that
their
proceeding
be
not
privately
watch
.
<EOS>
but
,
after
Lady
Verinder
have
dismiss
the
police

officer
,
and
have
stop
all
further
inquiry
into
the
loss
of
the
Diamond

no
one
else
could
presume
to
stir
in
the
matter

the
Indians
be
free
to
go
to
London
,
and
to
London
they
go
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
next
news
we
hear
of
them
,
Mr.
Bruff
?

They
be

Mr.
Luker
,
"
I
answer
,
"
by
loiter
about
the
house
at
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
read
the
report
of
Mr.
Luker
's
application
to
the
magistrate
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
course
of
his
statement
he
refer
,
if
you
remember
,
to
a
foreign
workman
in
his
employment
,
whom
he
have
just
dismiss
on
suspicion
of
attempt
theft
,
and
whom
he
also
distrust
as
possibly
act
in
collusion
with
the
Indians
who
have
annoy
him
.
<EOS>
the
inference
be
pretty
plain
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
as
to
who
write
that
letter
which
puzzle
you
just
now
,
and
as
to
which
of
Mr.
Luker
's
oriental
treasure
the
workman
have
attempt
to
steal
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
inference
(
as
I
hasten
to
acknowledge
)
be
too
plain
to
need
be
point
out
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
doubt
that
the
Moonstone
have
find
its
way
into
Mr.
Luker
's
hand
,
at
the
time
Mr.
Murthwaite
allude
to
.
<EOS>
My
only
question
have
be
,
how
have
the
Indians
discover
the
circumstance
?
<EOS>
this
question
(
the
most
difficult
to
deal
with
of
all
,
as
I
have
think
)
have
now
receive
its
answer
,
like
the
rest
.
<EOS>
lawyer
as
I
be
,
I
begin
to
feel
that
I
may
trust
Mr.
Murthwaite
to
lead
me
blindfold
through
the
last
winding
of
the
labyrinth
,
along
which
he
have
guide
me
thus
far
.
<EOS>
I
pay
him
the
compliment
of
tell
him
this
,
and
find
my
little
concession
very
graciously
receive
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
give
me
a
piece
of
information
in
your
turn
before
we
go
on
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
somebody
must
have
take
the
Moonstone
from
Yorkshire
to
London
.
<EOS>
and
somebody
must
have
raise
money
on
it
,
or
it
would
never
have
be
in
Mr.
Luker
's
possession
.
<EOS>
have
there
be
any
discovery
make
of
who
that
person
be
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
none
that
I
know
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
story
(
be
there
not
?
)
<EOS>
about
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
he
be
an
eminent
philanthropist
 
which
be
decidedly
against
him
,
to
begin
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
heartily
agree
in
this
with
Mr.
Murthwaite
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
I
feel
bind
to
inform
him
(
without
,
it
be
needless
to
say
,
mention
Miss
Verinder
's
name
)
that
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
have
be
clear
of
all
suspicion
,
on
evidence
which
I
could
answer
for
as
entirely
beyond
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
Mr.
Murthwaite
,
quietly
,
"
let
us
leave
it
to
time
to
clear
the
matter
up
.
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
we
must
get
back
again
to
the
Indians
,
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
Their
journey
to
London
simply
end
in
their
become
the
victim
of
another
defeat
.
<EOS>
the
loss
of
their
second
chance
of
seize
the
Diamond
be
mainly
attributable
,
as
I
think
,
to
the
cunning
and
foresight
of
Mr.
Luker
 
who
do
not
stand
at
the
top
of
the
prosperous
and
ancient
profession
of
usury
for
nothing
!
<EOS>
by
the
prompt
dismissal
of
the
man
in
his
employment
,
he
deprive
the
Indians
of
the
assistance
which
their
confederate
would
have
render
them
in
get
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
by
the
prompt
transport
of
the
Moonstone
to
his
banker
's
,
he
take
the
conspirator
by
surprise
before
they
be
prepare
with
a
new
plan
for
rob
him
.
<EOS>
how
the
Indians
,
in
this
latter
case
,
suspect
what
he
have
do
,
and
how
they
contrive
to
possess
themselves
of
his
banker
's
receipt
,
be
event
too
recent
to
need
dwell
on
.
<EOS>
let
it
be
enough
to
say
that
they
know
the
moonstone
to
be
once
more
out
of
their
reach
;
deposit
(
under
the
general
description
of
"
a
valuable
of
great
price
"
)
in
a
banker
's
strong
room
.
<EOS>
now
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
what
be
their
third
chance
of
seize
the
Diamond
?
<EOS>
and
when
will
it
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
the
question
pass
his
lip
,
I
penetrate
the
motive
of
the
Indian
's
visit
to
my
office
at
last
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Indians
take
it
for
grant
,
as
we
do
,
that
the
Moonstone
have
be
pledge
;
and
they
want
to
be
certainly
inform
of
the
early
period
at
which
the
pledge
can
be
redeem
 
because
that
will
be
the
early
period
at
which
the
Diamond
can
be
remove
from
the
safe
keeping
of
the
bank
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
you
would
find
it
out
for
yourself
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
if
I
only
give
you
a
fair
chance
.
<EOS>
in
a
year
from
the
time
when
the
Moonstone
be
pledge
,
the
Indians
will
be
on
the
watch
for
their
third
chance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
's
own
lip
have
tell
them
how
long
they
will
have
to
wait
,
and
your
respectable
authority
have
satisfy
them
that
Mr.
Luker
have
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
when
do
we
suppose
,
at
a
rough
guess
,
that
the
Diamond
find
its
way
into
the
money
-
lender
's
hand
?

<EOS>
"
towards
the
end
of
last
June

I
answer
,

as
well

I

it

<EOS>

we
be

if
the

the

will
be
in

nine

<EOS>
I
shall
be
thousand
of
mile
from
England
and
English
news
at
that
date

it
may
be
worth
YOUR

it

to
arrange
to
be

make
a

close

repeat

FRANKLIN

in
the

of
the

eighteen
hundred

nine
I
be
wander
in
the
East
,
and
have
then
recently
alter
the
travel
plan
which
I
have
lay
out
some
month
before
,
and
which
I
have
communicate
to
my
lawyer
and
my
banker
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
this
change
make
it
necessary
for
me
to
send
one
of
my
servant
to
obtain
my
letter
and
remittance
from
the
english
consul
in
a
certain
city
,
which
be
no
longer
include
as
one
of
my
resting

place
in
my
new
travel
scheme
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
to
join
me
again
at
an
appoint
place
and
time
.
<EOS>
an
accident
,
for
which
he
be
not
responsible
,
delay
him
on
his
errand
.
<EOS>
for
a
week
I
and
my
people
wait
,
encamp
on
the
border
of
a
desert
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
miss
man
make
his
appearance
,
with
the
money
and
the
letter
,
at
the
entrance
of
my
tent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
I
bring
you
bad
news
,
sir
,
"
he
say
,
and
point
to
one
of
the
letter
,
which
have
a
mourn
border
round
it
,
and
the
address
on
which
be
in
the
handwriting
of
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
,
in
a
case
of
this
kind
,
so
unendurable
as
suspense
.
<EOS>
the
letter
with
the
mourn
border
be
the
letter
that
I
open
first
.
  
<EOS>
It
inform
me
that
my
father
be
dead
,
and
that
I
be
heir
to
his
great
fortune
.
<EOS>
the
wealth
which
have
thus
fall
into
my
hand
bring
its
responsibility
with
it
,
and
Mr.
Bruff
entreat
me
to
lose
no
time
in
return
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
by
daybreak
the
next
morning
,
I
be
on
my
way
back
to
my
own
country
.
  
<EOS>
the
picture
present
of
me
,
by
my
old
friend
Betteredge
,
at
the
time
of
my
departure
from
England
,
be
(
as
I
think
)
a
little
overdrawn
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
in
his
own
quaint
way
,
interpret
seriously
one
of
his
young
mistress
's
many
satirical
reference
to
my
foreign
education
;
and
have
persuade
himself
that
he
actually
see
those
french
,
german
,
and
italian
side
to
my
character
,
which
my
lively
cousin
only
profess
to
discover
in
jest
,
and
which
never
have
any
real
existence
,
except
in
our
good
Betteredge
's
own
brain
.
<EOS>
but
,
bar
this
drawback
,
I
be
bind
to
own
that
he
have
state
no
more
than
the
truth
in
represent
me
as
wound
to
the
heart
by
Rachel
's
treatment
,
and
as
leave
England
in
the
first
keenness
of
suffering
cause
by
the
bitter
disappointment
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
abroad
,
resolve
 
if
change
and
absence
could
help
me
 
to
forget
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
I
be
persuade
,
no
true
view
of
human
nature
which
deny
that
change
and
absence
DO
help
a
man
under
these
circumstance
;
they
force
his
attention
away
from
the
exclusive
contemplation
of
his
own
sorrow
.
<EOS>
I
never
forget
her
;
but
the
pang
of
remembrance
lose
its
bad
bitterness
,
little
by
little
,
as
time
,
distance
,
and
novelty
interpose
themselves
more
and
more
effectually
between
Rachel
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
it
be
no
less
certain
that
,
with
the
act
of
turning
homeward
,
the
remedy
which
have
gain
its
ground
so
steadily
,
begin
now
,
just
as
steadily
,
to
drop
back
.
<EOS>
the
nearer
I
draw
to
the
country
which
she
inhabit
,
and
to
the
prospect
of
see
her
again
,
the
more
irresistibly
her
influence
begin
to
recover
its
hold
on
me
.
<EOS>
on
leave
England
she
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
whose
name
I
would
have
suffer
to
pass
my
lip
.
<EOS>
on
return
to
England
,
she
be
the
first
person
I
inquire
after
,
when
Mr.
Bruff
and
I
meet
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
inform
,
of
course
,
of
all
that
have
happen
in
my
absence
;
in
other
word
,
of
all
that
have
be
relate
here
in
continuation
of
Betteredge
's
narrative
 
one
circumstance
only
be
except
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
do
not
,
at
that
time
,
feel
himself
at
liberty
to
inform
me
of
the
motive
which
have
privately
influence
Rachel
and
Godfrey
Ablewhite
in
recall
the
marriage
promise
,
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
I
trouble
him
with
no
embarrass
question
on
this
delicate
subject
.
<EOS>
It
be
relief
enough
to
me
,
after
the
jealous
disappointment
cause
by
hear
that
she
have
ever
contemplate
be
Godfrey
's
wife
,
to
know
that
reflection
have
convince
her
of
act
rashly
,
and
that
she
have
effect
her
own
release
from
her
marriage
engagement
.
  
<EOS>
have
hear
the
story
of
the
past
,
my
next
inquiry
(
still
inquiry
after
Rachel
!
)
advance
naturally
to
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
under
whose
care
have
she
be
place
after
leave
Mr.
Bruff
's
house
?
<EOS>
and
where
be
she
live
now
?
  
<EOS>
She
be
live
under
the
care
of
a
widow
sister
of
the
late
Sir
John
Verinder
 
<EOS>
one
Mrs.
Merridew
 
whom
her
mother
's
executor
have
request
to
act
as
guardian
,
and
who
have
accept
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
They
be
report
to
me
as
get
on
together
admirably
well
,
and
as
be
now
establish
,
for
the
season
,
in
Mrs.
Merridew
's
house
in
Portland
Place
.
  
<EOS>
half
an
hour
after
receive
this
information
,
I
be
on
my
way
to
Portland
Place
 
without
have
have
the
courage
to
own
it
to
Mr.
Bruff
!
  
<EOS>
the
man
who
answer
the
door
be
not
sure
whether
Miss
Verinder
be
at
home
or
not
.
<EOS>
I
send
him
upstairs
with
my
card
,
as
the
speedy
way
of
set
the
question
at
rest
.
<EOS>
the
man
come
down
again
with
an
impenetrable
face
,
and
inform
me
that
Miss
Verinder
be
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
have
suspect
other
people
of
purposely
deny
themselves
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
impossible
to
suspect
Rachel
.
<EOS>
I
leave
word
that
I
would
call
again
at
six
o'clock
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
at
six
o'clock
I
be
inform
for
the
second
time
that
Miss
Verinder
be
not
at
home

<EOS>
have
any
message
be
leave

<EOS>
no

have
be

have
Miss
Verinder
not
receive
my
card
?
<EOS>
the
servant
beg
my
pardon
 
Miss
Verinder
HAD
receive
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
inference
be
too
plain
to
be
resist
.
<EOS>
Rachel
decline
to
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
on
my
side
,
I
decline
to
be
treat
in
this
way
,
without
make
an
attempt
,
at
least
,
to
discover
a
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
send
up
my
name
to
Mrs.
Merridew
,
and
request
her
to
favour
me
with
a
personal
interview
at
any
hour
which
it
may
be
most
convenient
to
her
to
name
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Merridew
make
no
difficulty
about
receive
me
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
be
show
into
a
comfortable
little
sitting
-
room
,
and
find
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
comfortable
little
elderly
lady
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
good
as
to
feel
great
regret
and
much
surprise
,
entirely
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
She
be
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
not
in
a
position
to
offer
me
any
explanation
,
or
to
press
Rachel
on
a
matter
which
appear
to
relate
to
a
question
of
private
feeling
alone
.
<EOS>
this
be
say
over
and
over
again
,
with
a
polite
patience
that
nothing
could
tire
;
and
this
be
all
I
gain
by
apply
to
Mrs.
Merridew
.
  
<EOS>
My
last
chance
be
to
write
to
Rachel
.
<EOS>
My
servant
take
a
letter
to
her
the
next
day
,
with
strict
instruction
to
wait
for
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
the
answer
come
back
,
literally
in
one
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
"
miss
verinder
beg
to
decline

Mr.
Franklin
Blake

"
  
<EOS>
Fond
as
I
be
of
her
<EOS>
,
I
feel
indignantly
the
insult
offer
to
me
in
that
reply
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
come
in
to
speak
to
me
on
business
,
before
I
have
recover
possession
of
myself
.
<EOS>
I
dismiss
the
business
on
the
spot
,
and
lay
the
whole
case
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
prove
to
be
as
incapable
of
enlighten
me
as
Mrs.
Merridew
herself
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
if
any
slander
have
be
speak
of
me
in
Rachel
's
hearing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
be
not
aware
of
any
slander
of
which
I
be
the
object
.
<EOS>
have
she
refer
to
me
in
any
way
while
she
be
stay
under
Mr.
Bruff
's
roof

<EOS>
never

<EOS>
have
she
not
so
much
as
ask
,
during
all
my
long
absence
,
whether
I
be
live
or
dead
?
<EOS>
no
such
question
have
ever
pass
her
lip
.
<EOS>
I
take
out
of
my
pocket
-
book
the
letter
which
poor
Lady
Verinder
have
write
to
me
from
Frizinghall
,
on
the
day
when
I
leave
her
house
in
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
and
I
point
Mr.
Bruff
's
attention
to
these
two
sentence
in
it
:
  
<EOS>
"
the
valuable
assistance
which

to
the
inquiry

lost
jewel

an
unpardoned
offence

present
dreadful
state
of
Rachel
's
mind

<EOS>
move
blindfold
in
this
matter
,
you
have
add
to
the
burden
of
anxiety
which
she

innocently
threaten
her
secret
with
discovery
through
your
exertion

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
possible
,
"
I
ask
,
"
that
the
feeling
towards
me
which
be
there
describe
,
be
as
bitter
as
ever
against
me
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
look
unaffectedly
distressed
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
insist
on
an
answer
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
own
I
can
place
no
other
interpretation
on
her
conduct
than
that
.

"
  
<EOS>
I
ring
the
bell
,
and
direct
my
servant
to
pack
my
portmanteau
,
and
to
send
out
for
a
railway
guide
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
ask
,
in
astonishment
,
what
I
be
go
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be

to
Yorkshire

"
I
answer

by

<EOS>

May
I
ask
for
what
purpose
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
,
the
assistance
I
innocently
render
to
the
inquiry
after
the
Diamond
be
an
unpardoned
offence
,
in
Rachel

nearly
a
year
since
;
and
it
remain
an
unpardoned
offence
still
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
accept
that
position
!
<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
find
out
the
secret
of
her
silence
towards
her
mother
,
and
her
enmity
towards
me
.
<EOS>
if
time
,
pain
,
and
money
can
do
it
,
I
will
lay
my
hand
on
the
thief
who
take
the
moonstone

<EOS>
the
worthy
old
gentleman
attempt
to
remonstrate
 
to
induce
me
to
listen
to
reason
 
to
do
his
duty
towards
me
,
in
short
.
<EOS>
I
be
deaf
to
everything
that
he
could
urge
.
<EOS>
no
earthly
consideration
would
,
at
that
moment

have
shake
the
resolution
that
be
in
me

<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
up
the
inquiry
again

<EOS>
I
go
on
,
"
at
the
point

I
drop
it

"
  
<EOS>
towards
sunset
that
evening
I
stand
again
on
the
well

remember
terrace
,
and
look
once
more
at
the
peaceful
old
country
house

<EOS>
the
gardener

the
first
person
whom
I
see
in
the
desert
ground

<EOS>
He
have
leave
Betteredge
,
an
hour
since
,
sun
himself
in
the
customary
corner
of
the
back
yard
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
well
;
and
I
say
I
would
go
and
seek
him
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
round
by
the
familiar
path
and
passage
,
and
look
in
at
the
open
gate
of
the
yard
.
  
<EOS>
there
he
be
 
the
dear
old
friend
of
the
happy
day
that
be
never

there
he
be
in
the
old
corner
,
on
the

with
his
pipe
in

mouth
,
and
his
ROBINSON

,
and
his

on

I

<EOS>
either
the
dog
see
it
,
or
their
keen
scent
inform
them
of
my
approach
;
they
start
up
with
a
growl
.
<EOS>
start
in
his
turn
,
the
old
man
quiet
them
by
a
word
,
and
then
shade
his
fail
eye
with
his
hand
,
and
look
inquiringly
at
the
figure
at
the
gate
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
eye
be
full
of
tear

<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
wait
a
moment
before
I
could
trust
myself

<EOS>
"

stand
for
a

look
backwards

forwards
between

apparently
at

loss
to
discover

I

inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Hotherstone
herself
,
sir
,
ask
for
my
good
word
to
recommend
the
room
,
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
them
,
Betteredge
,
with
the
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
go
back
to
the
yard
,
in
which
I
have
leave
my
travelling
-
bag
.
<EOS>
after
put
a
stick
through
the
handle
,
and
swinge
the
bag
over
his
shoulder
,
Betteredge
appear
to
relapse
into
the
bewilderment
which
my
sudden
appearance
have
cause
,
when
I
surprise
him
in
the
beehive
chair
.
<EOS>
He
look
incredulously
at
the
house
,
and
then
he
wheel
about
,
and
look
more
incredulously
still
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
live
a
goodish
long
time
in
the
world
,
"
say
this
good
and
dear
of
all
old
servant
 
"
but
the
like
of
this
,
I
never
do
expect
to
see
.
<EOS>
there
stand
the
house
,
and
here
stand
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
 
and
,
Damme
,
if
one
of
them
be
not
turn
his
back
on
the
other
,
and
go
to
sleep
in
a
lodging
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
lead
the
way
out
,
wag
his
head
and
growl
ominously
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
only
one
more
miracle
that
CAN
happen
,
"
he
say
to
me
,
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
the
next
thing
you
will
do
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
will
be
to
pay
me
back
that
seven
-
and
-
sixpence
you
borrow
of
me
when
you
be
a
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
stroke
of
sarcasm
put
him
in
a
well
humour
with
himself
and
with
me
.
<EOS>
We
leave
the
house
,
and
pass
through
the
lodge
gate
.
<EOS>
once
clear
of
the
ground
,
the
duty
of
hospitality
(
in
Betteredge
's
code
of
moral
)
cease
,
and
the
privilege
of
curiosity
begin
.
  
<EOS>
He
drop
back
,
so
as
to
let
me
get
on
a
level
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
fine
evening
for
a
walk
,
Mr.
Franklin
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
,
as
if
we
have
just
accidentally
encounter
each
other
at
that
moment

Betteredge

suddenly
abandon
the
crooked
way
,

take
the
straight
one
,

<EOS>
the
old
man
suddenly
stand
still
,
and
look
at
me
in
the
grey
twilight
as
if

It
be
likely
enough
that
I
speak
rather
carelessly

<EOS>
at
any
rate

Betteredge
seem
to
be
pique
by
something
in

the
one
chance

inquiry

<EOS>
those
word
evidently
put
the
case
before
him

as
he

ask

prompt

come

lock

He
point
to
a
light
,
glimmer
below
us
;
and
,
at
the

moment
,
I
hear
through
the
stillness

the
evening
the
bubbling
of
a
stream

Farm

We
descend
the
path
that
lead
to
the
Farm

<EOS>
I
have
only
the
most
indistinct
recollection
of
what
happen
at
Hotherstone
's
Farm
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
a
hearty
welcome
;
a
prodigious
supper
,
which
would
have
feed
a
whole
village
in
the
East
;
a
delightfully
clean
bedroom
,
with
nothing
in
it
to
regret
but
that
detestable
product
of
the
folly
of
our
fore
-
father
 
a
feather
-
bed
;
a
restless
night
,
with
much
kindling
of
match
,
and
many
lighting
of
one
little
candle
;
and
an
immense
sensation
of
relief
when
the
sun
rise
,
and
there
be
a
prospect
of
get
up
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
arrange
over

night

Betteredge

I
be
to
call
for

as
early

I
like

,
interpret
by
my
impatience

get
possession

mean
as
early
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
without
wait
for
breakfast
at
the
Farm
,
I
take
a
crust
of
bread
in
my
hand
,
and
set
forth
,
in
some
doubt
whether
I
should
not
surprise
the
excellent
Betteredge
in
his
bed
.
<EOS>
to
my
great
relief
he
prove
to
be
quite
as
excited
about
the
come
event
as
I
be

<EOS>
I
find
him
ready
,
and
wait
for
me

with
his
stick
in

<EOS>

I

a
new
disease

Mr.
Franklin
,
of
my
own
inventing

I
do
not

to
alarm
you

you

catch
it
before
the
morning
be
out

the

do
you
feel
an
uncomfortable
heat
at

pit
of
your

sir

a
nasty
thumping
at
the
top
of
your
head
?
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
not
yet
?
<EOS>
It
will
lay
hold
of
you
at
Cobb

Hole

Mr.
Franklin

I
call
it
the
detective

fever

I
first
catch
it
in
the
company
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
!
aye
!
<EOS>
and
the
cure
in
this
instance
be
to
open
Rosanna
Spearman
's
letter

I
suppose
?
<EOS>
come
along
,
and
let
's
get
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
early
as
it
be
,
we
find
the
fisherman
's
wife
astir
in
her
kitchen
.
<EOS>
on
my
presentation
by
Betteredge
,
good
Mrs.
Yolland
perform
a
social
ceremony
,
strictly
reserve
(
as
I
afterwards
learn
)
for
stranger
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
She
put
a
bottle
of
dutch
gin
and
a
couple
of
clean
pipe
on
the
table
,
and
open
the
conversation
by
say
,
"
what
news
from
London
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
before
I
could
find
an
answer
to
this
immensely
comprehensive
question
,
an
apparition
advance
towards
me
,
out
of
a
dark
corner
of
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
a
wan
,
wild
,
haggard
girl
,
with
remarkably
beautiful
hair
,
and
with
a
fierce
keenness
in
her
eye
,
come
limp
up
on
a
crutch
to
the
table
at
which
I
be
sit
,
and
look
at
me
as
if
I
be
an
object
of
mingle
interest
and
horror
,
which
it
quite
fascinate
her
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Betteredge
,
"
she
say
,
without
take
her
eye
off
me
,
"
mention
his
name
again
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
this
gentleman
's
name
,
"
answer
Betteredge
(
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
GENTLEMAN
)
,
"
be
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
girl
turn
her
back
on
me
,
and
suddenly
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
good
Mrs.
Yolland
 
as
I
believe
 
make
some
apology
for
her
daughter
's
odd
behaviour
,
and
Betteredge
(
probably
)
translate
them
into
polite
English
.
<EOS>
I
speak
of
this
in
complete
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
My
attention
be
absorb
in
follow
the
sound
of
the
girl
's
crutch
.
<EOS>
thump
-
thump
,
up
the
wooden
stair
;
thump
-
thump
across
the
room
above
our
head
;
thump
-
thump
down
the
stair
again
 
<EOS>
and
there
stand
the
apparition
at
the
open
door
,
with
a
letter
in
its
hand
,
beckon
me
out
!
  
<EOS>
I
leave
more
apology
in
course
of
delivery
behind
me
,
and
follow
this
strange
creature
 
limp
on
before
me
,
faster
and
faster
 
down
the
slope
of
the
beach
.
<EOS>
She
lead
me
behind
some
boat
,
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
the
few
people
in
the
fishing
-
village
,
and
then
stop
,
and
face
me
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
stand
there
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
want
to
look
at
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
mistake
the
expression
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
I
inspire
her
with
the
strong
emotion
of
abhorrence
and
disgust
.
<EOS>
let
me
not
be
vain
enough
to
say
that
no
woman
have
ever
look
at
me
in
this
manner
before
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
venture
on
the
more
modest
assertion
that
no
woman
have
ever
let
me
perceive
it
yet
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
limit
to
the
length
of
the
inspection
which
a
man
can
endure
,
under
certain
circumstance
.
<EOS>
I
attempt
to
direct
Limping
Lucy
's
attention
to
some
less
revolting
object
than
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
have
get
a
letter
to
give
me
,
"
I
begin
.
<EOS>
"
be
it
the
letter
there
,
in
your
hand
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
say
that
again
,
"
be
the
only
answer
I
receive
.
  
<EOS>
I
repeat
the
word
,
like
a
good
child
learn
its
lesson
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
girl
,
speak
to
herself
,
but
keep
her
eye
still
mercilessly
fix
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
find
out
what
she
see
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
guess
what
she
hear
in
his
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
suddenly
look
away
from
me
,
and
rest
her
head
wearily
on
the
top
of
her
crutch
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
poor
dear
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
in
the
first
soft
tone
which
have
fall
from
her
,
in
my
hearing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
my
lose
darling
!
<EOS>
what
could
you
see
in
this
man
?
"
<EOS>
She
lift
her
head
again
fiercely
,
and
look
at
me
once
more
.
"
<EOS>
Can
you
eat
and
drink
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
my
good
to
preserve
my
gravity
,
and
answer
,
"
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
sleep
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
see
a
poor
girl
in
service
,
do
you
feel
no
remorse
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
why
should
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
abruptly
thrust
the
letter
(
as
the
phrase
be
)
into
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
it
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
set
eye
on
you
before
.
<EOS>
God
Almighty
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
ever
set
eye
on
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
those
part
word
she
limp
away
from
me
at
the
top
of
her
speed
.
<EOS>
the
one
interpretation
that
I
could
put
on
her
conduct
have
,
no
doubt
,
be
anticipate
by
everybody
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
suppose
that
she
be
mad
.
  
<EOS>
have
reach
that
inevitable
conclusion
,
I
turn
to
the
more
interesting
object
of
investigation
which
be
present
to
me
by
Rosanna
Spearman
's
letter
.
<EOS>

address
be

I
break

envelope

a
letter

and
this
,
in
its
turn
,
contain
a
slip

I
read
the
letter
first
:

<EOS>
I
turn
to
the
slip
of
paper
next
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
literal
copy
of
it
,
word
for
word
:

<EOS>
just
as

have
read

last
word

in

original

I
hear
the
voice
of
Betteredge

completely
succumb
to

hand
him
the
letter
,
and
the
memorandum

<EOS>
He
read
the
first
without
appear
to

interested
in
it

<EOS>
but
the
second
 
the
memorandum
 
produce

strong
impression

look
up
,
and
observe
a

at
work

at
some
little
distance
from

mend
a
net

We
can
go
round
by
the
coast
,
Mr.

"
say
Betteredge
;
"
and
get
to
the
quicksand
in
that
way
with
plenty
of
time

what
do
you
say
,

"
  
<EOS>
"
come
along
!
"
  
<EOS>
on
our
way
to
the
Shivering
Sand
,
I
apply
to
Betteredge
to
revive
my
memory
of
event
(
as
affect
Rosanna
Spearman
)
at
the
period
of
Sergeant
Cuff
's
inquiry
.
<EOS>
with
my
old
friend
's
help
,
I
soon
have
the
succession
of
circumstance
clearly
register
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Rosanna
's
journey
to
Frizinghall
,
when
the
whole
household
believe
her
to
be
ill
in
her
own
room
 
Rosanna
's
mysterious
employment
of
the
night
-
time
with
her
door
lock
,
and
her
candle
burn
till
the
morning
 
<EOS>
Rosanna
's
suspicious
purchase
of
the
japan
tin
case
,
and
the
two
dog
's
chain
from
Mrs.
Yolland
 
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
's
positive
conviction
that
Rosanna
have
hide
something
at
the
Shivering
Sand
,
and
the
Sergeant
's
absolute
ignorance
as
to
what
that
something
may
be
 
all
these
strange
result
of
the
abortive
inquiry
into
the
loss
of
the
Moonstone
be
clearly
present
to
me
again
,
when
we
reach
the
quicksand
,
and
walk
out
together
on
the
low
ledge
of
rock
call
the
South
Spit
.
  
<EOS>
with
Betteredge
's
help
,
I
soon
stand
in
the
right
position
to
see
the
Beacon
and
the
Coast
-
guard
flagstaff
in
a
line
together
.
<EOS>
follow
the
memorandum
as
our
guide
,
we
next
lay
my
stick
in
the
necessary
direction
,
as
neatly
as
we
could
,
on
the
uneven
surface
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
and
then
we
look
at
our
watch
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
want
nearly
twenty
minute
yet
of
the
turn
of
the
tide
.
<EOS>
I
suggest
wait
through
this
interval
on
the
beach
,
instead
of
on
the
wet
and
slippery
surface
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
have
reach
the
dry
sand
,
I
prepare
to
sit
down
;
and
,
greatly
to
my
surprise
,
Betteredge
prepare
to
leave
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
go
away
for
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
at
the
letter
again
,
sir
,
and
you
will
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
glance
at
the
letter
remind
me
that
I
be
charge
,
when
I
make
my
discovery
,
to
make
it
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
hard
enough
for
me
to
leave
you
,
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
"
say
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
but
she
die
a
dreadful
death
,
poor
soul
 
<EOS>
and
I
feel
a
kind
of
call
on
me
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
to
humour
that
fancy
of
her
.
<EOS>
besides
,
"
he
add
,
confidentially
,
"
there
be
nothing
in
the
letter
against
your
letting
out
the
secret
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
will
hang
about
in
the
fir
plantation
,
and
wait
till
you
pick
me
up
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
long
than
you
can
help
,
sir
.
<EOS>
the
detective
-
fever
be
not
an
easy
disease
to
deal
with
,
under
these
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
parting
caution
,
he
leave
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
interval
of
expectation
,
short
as
it
be
when
reckon
by
the
measure
of
time
,
assume
formidable
proportion
when
reckon
by
the
measure
of
suspense
.
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
occasion
on
which
the
invaluable
habit
of
smoking
become
especially
precious
and
consolatory
.
<EOS>
I
light
a
cigar
,
and
sit
down
on
the
slope
of
the
beach
.
  
<EOS>
the
sunlight
pour
its
unclouded
beauty
on
every
object
that
I
could
see
.
<EOS>
the
exquisite
freshness
of
the
air
make
the
mere
act
of
living
and
breathe
a
luxury
.
<EOS>
even
the
lonely
little
bay
welcome
the
morning
with
a
show
of
cheerfulness
;
and
the
bare
wet
surface
of
the
quicksand
itself
,
glitter
with
a
golden
brightness
,
hide
the
horror
of
its
false
brown
face
under
a
pass
smile
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
fine
day
I
have
see
since
my
return
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
the
turn
of
the
tide
come
,
before
my
cigar
be
finish
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
preliminary
heaving
of
the
Sand
,
and
then
the
awful
shiver
that
creep
over
its
surface
 
as
if
some
spirit
of
terror
live
and
move
and
shudder
in
the
fathomless
deep
beneath
.
<EOS>
I
throw
away
my
cigar
,
and
go
back
again
to
the
rock
.
  
<EOS>
My
direction
in
the
memorandum
instruct
me
to
feel
along
the
line
trace
by
the
stick
,
begin
with
the
end
which
be
near
to
the
beacon
.
  
<EOS>
I
advance
,
in
this
manner
,
more
than
half
way
along
the
stick
,
without
encounter
anything
<EOS>
but
the
edge
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
an
inch
or
two
further
on
,
however
,
my
patience
be
reward
.
<EOS>
in
a
narrow
little
fissure
,
just
within
reach
of
my
forefinger
,
I
feel
the
chain
.
<EOS>
attempt
,
next
,
to
follow
it
,
by
touch
,
in
the
direction
of
the
quicksand
,
I
find
my
progress
stop
by
a
thick
growth
of
seaweed
 
which
have
fasten
itself
into
the
fissure
,
no
doubt
,
in
the
time
that
have
elapse
since
Rosanna
Spearman
have
choose
her
hiding
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
equally
impossible
to
pull
up
the
seaweed
,
or
to
force
my
hand
through
it
.
<EOS>
after
mark
the
spot
indicate
by
the
end
of
the
stick
which
be
place
near
to
the
quicksand
,
I
determine
to
pursue
the
search
for
the
chain
on
a
plan
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
My
idea
be
to
"
sound
"
immediately
under
the
rock
,
on
the
chance
of
recover
the
lose
trace
of
the
chain
at
the
point
at
which
it
enter
the
sand
.
<EOS>
I
take
up
the
stick
,
and
kneel
down
on
the
brink
of
the
South
Spit
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
position
,
my
face
be
within
a
few
foot
of
the
surface
of
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
it
so
near
me
,
still
disturb
at
interval
by
its
hideous
shivering
fit
,
shake
my
nerve
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
a
horrible
fancy
that
the
dead
woman
may
appear
on
the
scene
of
her
suicide
,
to
assist
my
search
 
an
unutterable
dread
of
see
her
rise
through
the
heave
surface
of
the
sand
,
and
point
to
the
place
 
force
itself
into
my
mind
,
and
turn
me
cold
in
the
warm
sunlight
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
close
my
eye
at
the
moment
when
the
point
of
the
stick
first
enter
the
quicksand
.
  
<EOS>
the
instant
afterwards
,
before
the
stick
could
have
be
submerge
more
than
a
few
inch
<EOS>
,
I
be
free
from
the
hold
of
my
own
superstitious
terror
,
and
be
throb
with
excitement
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
sound
blindfold
,
at
my
first
attempt
 
at
that
first
attempt
I
have
sound
right
!
<EOS>
the
stick
strike
the
chain
.
  
<EOS>
take
a
firm
hold
of
the
root
of
the
seaweed
with
my
left
hand
,
I
lay
myself
down
over
the
brink
,
and
feel
with
my
right
hand
under
the
overhang
edge
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
My
right
hand
find
the
chain
.
  
<EOS>
I
draw
it
up
without
the
slight
difficulty
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
the
japan
tin
case
fasten
to
the
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
action
of
the
water
have
so
rust
the
chain
,
that
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
unfasten
it
from
the
hasp
which
attach
it
to
the
case
.
<EOS>
put
the
case
between
my
knee
and
exert
my
utmost
strength
,
I
contrive
to
draw
off
the
cover
.
<EOS>
some
white
substance
fill
the
whole
interior
when
I
look
in
.
<EOS>
I
put
in
my
hand
,
and
find
it
to
be
linen
.
  
<EOS>
in
draw
out
the
linen
,
I
also
draw
out
a
letter
crumple
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
after
look
at
the
direction
,
and
discover
that
it
bear
my
name
,
I
put
the
letter
in
my
pocket
,
and
completely
remove
the
linen
.
<EOS>
It
come
out
in
a
thick
roll
,
mould
,
of
course
,
to
the
shape
of
the
case
in
which
it
have
be
so
long
confine
,
and
perfectly
preserve
from
any
injury
by
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
I
carry
the
linen
to
the
dry
sand
of
the
beach
,
and
there
unrolled
and
smooth
it
out
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
mistake
it
as
an
article
of
dress
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
nightgown
.
  
<EOS>
the
uppermost
side
,
when
I
spread
it
out
,
present
to
view
innumerable
fold
and
crease
,
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
I
try
the
undermost
side
,
next
 
and
instantly
discover
the
smear
of
the
paint
from
the
door
of
Rachel
's
boudoir
!
  
<EOS>
My
eye
remain
rivet
on
the
stain
,
and
my
mind
take
me
back
at
a
leap
from
present
to
past
.
<EOS>
the
very
word
of
Sergeant
Cuff
recur
to
me
,
as
if
the
man
himself
be
at
my
side
again
,
point
to
the
unanswerable
inference
which
he
draw
from
the
smear
on
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
find
out
whether
there
be
any
article
of
dress
in
this
house
with
the
stain
of
paint
on
it
.
<EOS>
find
out
who
that
dress
belong
to
.
<EOS>
find
out
how
the
person
can
account
for
have
be
in
the
room
,
and
smear
the
paint
between
midnight
and
three
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
if
the
person
can
not
satisfy
you
,
you
have
not
far
to
look
for
the
hand
that
take
the
Diamond
.
"
  
<EOS>
one
after
another
those
word
travel
over
my
memory
,
repeat
themselves
again
and
again
with
a
wearisome
,
mechanical
reiteration
.
<EOS>
I
be
rouse
from
what
feel
like
a
trance
of
many
hour
 
from
what
be
really
,
no
doubt
,
the
pause
of
a
few
moment
only
 
by
a
voice
call
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
look
up
,
and
see
that
Betteredge
's
patience
have
fail
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
He
be
just
visible
between
the
sandhill
,
return
to
the
beach
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
's
appearance
recall
me
,
the
moment
I
perceive
it
,
to
my
sense
of
present
thing
,
and
remind
me
that
the
inquiry
which
I
have
pursue
thus
far
still
remain
incomplete
.
<EOS>
I
have
discover
the
smear
on
the
nightgown
.
<EOS>
to
whom
do
the
nightgown
belong
?
  
<EOS>
My
first
impulse
be
to
consult
the
letter
in
my
pocket
 
<EOS>
the
letter
which
I
have
find
in
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
raise
my
hand
to
take
it
out
,
I
remember
that
there
be
a
short
way
to
discovery
than
this
.
<EOS>
the
nightgown
itself
would
reveal
the
truth
,
for
,
in
all
probability
,
the
nightgown
be
mark
with
its
owner
's
name
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
it
up
from
the
sand
,
and
look
for
the
mark
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
the
mark
,
and
read
 
my
own
NAME
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
the
familiar
letter
which
tell
me
that
the
nightgown
be
mine
.
<EOS>
I
look
up
from
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
sun
;
there
be
the
glitter
water
of
the
bay
;
there
be
old
Betteredge
,
advance
nearer
and
near
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
look
back
again
at
the
letter
.
<EOS>
My
own
name
.
<EOS>
plainly
confront
me
 
my
own
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
time
,
pain
,
and
money
can
do
it
,
I
will
lay
my
hand
on
the
thief
who
take
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
leave
London
,
with
those
word
on
my
lip
.
<EOS>
I
have
penetrate
the
secret
which
the
quicksand
have
keep
from
every
other
live
creature
.
<EOS>
and
,
on
the
unanswerable
evidence
of
the
paint
-
stain
,
I
have
discover
Myself
as
the
thief
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
not
a
word
to
say
about
my
own
sensation
.
  
<EOS>
My
impression
be
that
the
shock
inflict
on
me
completely
suspend
my
thinking
and
feel
power
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
could
not
have
know
what
I
be
about
when
Betteredge
join
me
 
for
I
have
it
on
his
authority
that
I
laugh
,
<EOS>
when
he
ask
what
be
the
matter
,
and
put
the
nightgown
into
his
hand
,
tell
him
to
read
the
riddle
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
of
what
be
say
between
us
on
the
beach
,
I
have
not
the
faint
recollection
.
<EOS>
the
first
place
in
which
I
can
now
see
myself
again
plainly
be
the
plantation
of
fir
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
and
I
be
walk
back
together
to
the
house
;
and
Betteredge
be
tell
me
that
I
shall
be
able
to
face
it
,
and
he
will
be
able
to
face
it
,
when
we
have
have
a
glass
of
grog
.
  
<EOS>
the
scene
shift
from
the
plantation
,
to
Betteredge
's
little
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
My
resolution
not
to
enter
Rachel
's
house
be
forget
.
<EOS>
I
feel
gratefully
the
coolness
and
shadiness
and
quiet
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
drink
the
grog
(
a
perfectly
new
luxury
to
me
,
at
that
time
of
day
)
,
which
my
good
old
friend
mix
with
icy
-
cold
water
from
the
well
.
<EOS>
under
any
other
circumstance
,
the
drink
would
simply
stupefy
me
.
<EOS>
as
thing
be
,
it
string
up
my
nerve
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
"
face
it
,
"
as
Betteredge
have
predict
.
<EOS>
and
Betteredge
,
on
his
side
,
begin
to
"
face
it
,
"
too
.
  
<EOS>
the
picture
which
I
be
now
present
of
myself
,
will
,
I
suspect
,
be
think
a
very
strange
one
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
.
<EOS>
place
in
a
situation
which
may
,
I
think
,
be
describe
as
entirely
without
parallel
,
what
be
the
first
proceeding
to
which
I
resort
?
<EOS>
do
I
seclude
myself
from
all
human
society
?
<EOS>
do
I
set
my
mind
to
analyse
the
abominable
impossibility
which
,
nevertheless
,
confront
me
as
an
undeniable
fact
?
<EOS>
do
I
hurry
back
to
London
by
the
first
train
to
consult
the
high
authority
,
and
to
set
a
search
inquiry
on
foot
immediately
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
accept
the
shelter
of
a
house
which
I
have
resolve
never
to
degrade
myself
by
enter
again
;
and
I
sit
,
tippling
spirit
and
water
in
the
company
of
an
old
servant
,
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
be
this
the
conduct
that
may
have
be
expect
from
a
man
place
in
my
horrible
position
?
<EOS>
I
can
only
answer
that
the
sight
of
old
Betteredge
's
familiar
face
be
an
inexpressible
comfort
to
me
,
and
that
the
drinking
of
old
Betteredge
's
grog
help
me
,
as
I
believe
nothing
else
would
have
help
me
,
in
the
state
of
complete
bodily
and
mental
prostration
into
which
I
have
fall
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
offer
this
excuse
for
myself
;
and
I
can
only
admire
that
invariable
preservation
of
dignity
,
and
that
strictly
logical
consistency
of
conduct
which
distinguish
every
man
and
woman
who
may
read
these
line
,
in
every
emergency
of
their
life
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
there
be
one
thing
certain
,
at
any
rate
,
"
say
Betteredge
,
throw
the
nightgown
down
on
the
table
between
us
,
and
point
to
it
as
if
it
be
a
live
creature
that
could
hear
him
.
"
<EOS>
he
be
a
liar
,
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
comforting
view
of
the
matter
be
not
the
view

present
itself
to
my

<EOS>
"
I
be
as
innocent
of
all
knowledge
of
have
take
the
Diamond
as
you
be

I
say

but
there
be
the
witness
against
me

nightgown

fact

Betteredge
lift
my

put
it
persuasively
into
my
hand

he
repeat
.
<EOS>
"
take
a
drop
more

over

confidentially

I
read

out

<EOS>
the
question
instantly
remind
me
of
the
letter
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
out
,
and
open
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
letter

many
page

closely
write

look
impatiently
for
the
signature
at
the
end

I
read

sudden
remembrance
illuminate
my

a
sudden
suspicion
rise
out
of
the
new
light

stop

I
exclaim

purposely
with

<EOS>
Betteredge
lay
his
hand
on
my
arm
,
and
stop
me
before
I
could
say
any
more
.

"
You
will
be
clear

speak
 
feel

I

<EOS>
I
resume
the
reading
of
the
letter

It
would
be
very
disgraceful
to
me

tell
you
this

if
I

a
live
woman

read
it

<EOS>
I
shall
be
dead

It

me
bold

<EOS>
not
even
my
grave
will
be
leave

tell

may
own
the
truth
 
with
the
quicksand
wait
to
hide
me

be
write

you
will
find
your
nightgown

you
will
want
to
know
how
it
come
to
be
hide
by

why
I
say
nothing
to
you
about
it
in

time

<EOS>
I
have
only
one
reason
to
give

I
do
these
strange

I
will

Verinder

me
out

reformatory

<EOS>
I
have
go
to
the
reformatory
from
the
prison

<EOS>
I
be
put
in
the
prison
,
because
I
be
a
thief

I
be
a
thief

street

quite
a
little
girl

My
mother

no

often
enough

do
you
remember
when
you
come
out
on
us
from
among
the
sand
hill
,
that
morning
,
look
for
Mr.
Betteredge

<EOS>
You
be
like
a
prince
in
a
fairy

story

<EOS>
You
be
like
a
lover
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
You
be
the
most
adorable
human
creature
I
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
something
that
feel
like
the
happy
life
I
have
never
lead
yet
,
leapt
up
in
me
at
the
instant
I
set
eye
on
you
.
<EOS>
do
not
laugh
at
this
if
you
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
oh
,
if
I
could
only
make
you
feel
how
serious
it
be
to
me
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
go
back
to
the
house
,
and
write
your
name
and
mine
in
my
work
-
box
,
and
draw
a
true
lover
'
knot
under
them
.
<EOS>
then
,
some
devil
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
ought
to
say
some
good
angel
 
whisper
to
me
,
"
go
and
look
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
glass
tell
me
 
never
mind
what
.
<EOS>
I
be
too
foolish
to
take
the
warning
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
get
fonder
and
fonder
of
you
,
just
as
if
I
be
a
lady
in
your
own
rank
of
life
,
and
the
most
beautiful
creature
your
eye
ever
rest
on
.
<EOS>
I
try
 
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
,
how
I
try
 
to
get
you
to
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
know
how
I
use
to
cry
at
night
with
the
misery
and
the
mortification
of
your
never
take
any
notice
of
me
,
you
would
have
pity
me
perhaps
,
and
have
give
me
a
look
now
and
then
to
live
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
be
no
very
kind
look
,
perhaps
,
if
you
have
know
how
I
hate
Miss
Rachel
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
find
out
you
be
in
love
with
her
,
before
you
know
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
She
use
to
give
you
rose
to
wear
in
your
button
-
hole
.
<EOS>
ah
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
you
wear
my
rose
oftener
than
either
you
<EOS>
or
she
think
!
<EOS>
the
only
comfort
I
have
at
that
time
,
be
put
my
rose
secretly
in
your
glass
of
water
,
in
place
of
her
 
and
then
throw
her
rise
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
she
have
be
really
as
pretty
as
you
think
her
,
I
may
have
bear
it
better
.
<EOS>
no
;
I
believe
I
should
have
be
more
spiteful
against
her
still
.
<EOS>
suppose
you
put
Miss
Rachel
into
a
servant
's
dress
,
and
take
her
ornament
off
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
be
the
use
of
my
writing
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
deny
that
she
have
a
bad
figure
;
she
be
too
thin
.
<EOS>
but
who
can
tell
what
the
man
like
?
<EOS>
and
young
lady
may
behave
in
a
manner
which
would
cost
a
servant
her
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
business
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
expect
you
to
read
my
letter
,
if
I
write
it
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
but
it
do
stir
one
up
to
hear
Miss
Rachel
call
pretty
,
when
one
know
all
the
time
that
it
be
her
dress
do
it
,
and
her
confidence
in
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
try
not
to
lose
patience
with
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
will
get
on
as
fast
as
I
can
to
the
time
which
be
sure
to
interest
you
 
the
time
when
the
Diamond
be
lose
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
one
thing
which
I
have
get
it
on
my
mind
to
tell
you
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
life
be
not
a
very
hard
life
to
bear
,
while
I
be
a
thief
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
they
have
teach
me
at
the
reformatory
to
feel
my
own
degradation
,
and
to
try
for
well
thing
,
that
the
day
grow
long
and
weary
.
<EOS>
thought
of
the
future
force
themselves
on
me
now
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
dreadful
reproach
that
honest
people
 
even
the
kind
of
honest
people
 
be
to
me
in
themselves
.
<EOS>
a
heart
-
break
sensation
of
loneliness
keep
with
me
,
go
where
I
may
,
and
do
what
I
may
,
and
see
what
person
I
may
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
duty
,
I
know
,
to
try
and
get
on
with
my
fellow
-
servant
in
my
new
place
.
<EOS>
somehow
,
I
could
not
make
friend
with
them
.
<EOS>
They
look
(
or
I
think
they
look
)
as
if
they
suspect
what
I
have
be
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
regret
,
far
from
it
,
have
be
rouse
to
make
the
effort
to
be
a
reform
woman
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
indeed
it
be
a
weary
life
.
<EOS>
You
have
come
across
it
like
a
beam
of
sunshine
at
first
 
<EOS>
and
then
you
too
fail
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
mad
enough
to
love
you
;
and
I
could
not
even
attract
your
notice
.
<EOS>
there
be
great
misery
 
there
really
be
great
misery
in
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
I
be
come
to
what
I
want
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
in
those
day
of
bitterness
,
I
go
two
or
three
time
,
when
it
be
my
turn
to
go
out
,
to
my
favourite
place
 
the
beach
above
the
Shivering
Sand
.
<EOS>
and
I
say
to
myself
,
"
I
think
it
will
end
here
.
<EOS>
when
I
can
bear
it
no
longer
,
I
think
it
will
end
here
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
understand
,
sir
,
that
the
place
have
lay
a
kind
of
spell
on
me
before
you
come
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
have
a
notion
that
something
would
happen
to
me
at
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
never
look
at
it
,
with
the
thought
of
its
be
the
mean
of
my
make
away
with
myself
,
till
the
time
come
of
which
I
be
now
write
.
<EOS>
then
I
do
think
that
here
be
a
place
which
would
end
all
my
trouble
for
me
in
a
moment
or
two
 
and
hide
me
for
ever
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
all
I
have
to
say
about
myself
,
reckon
from
the
morning
when
I
first
see
you
,
to
the
morning
when
the
alarm
be
raise
in
the
house
that
the
Diamond
be
lose
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
aggravate
by
the
foolish
talk
among
the
woman
servant
,
all
wonder
who
be
to
be
suspect
first
;
and
I
be
so
angry
with
you
(
know
no
better
at
that
time
)
for
the
pain
you
take
in
hunting
for
the
jewel
,
and
send
for
the
police
,
that
I
keep
as
much
as
possible
away
by
myself
,
until
later
in
the
day
,
when
the
officer
from
Frizinghall
come
to
the
house

Mr.
Seegrave
begin
,
as
you
may
remember

by
set
a
guard
on

bedroom

the

all
follow
him
up

stair
in
a
rage

know
what
he
mean
by
the
insult
he
have
put
on

go
with
the
rest

if
I
have
do
anything
different
from
the
rest

Mr.

the
sort
of
man

would
have
suspect

directly

I
shall
not
tell
you
in
plain
word
<EOS>
what
be
the
first
suspicion
that
cross
my
mind
,
when
I
have
make
that
discovery
.
<EOS>
You
would
only
be
angry

,
if
you
be
angry

you
may
tear
my
letter
up

read
no

let
it
be
enough

if
you
please
,
to
say
only
this

think
it
over
to
the
good
of
my
ability
,
I
make
it
out
that
the
thing
be
not
likely
,
for
a
reason
that
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
be
in
Miss
Rachel
's
sitting
-
room
,
at
that
time
of
night
,
with
Miss
Rachel
's
knowledge
(
and
if
you
have
be
foolish
enough
to
forget
to
take
care
of
the
wet
door

<EOS>
she
would
have
remind
you
 
<EOS>
she
would
never
have
let
you
carry
away
such
a
witness
against
her
,
as
the
witness
I
be
look
at
now
!
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
I
own
I
be
not
completely
certain
in
my
own
mind
that
I
have
prove
my
own
suspicion
to
be
wrong

<EOS>
You
will
not
have
forget
that
I
have
own
to
hate
Miss
Rachel

<EOS>
try
to
think
,
if
you
can
,
that
there
be
a
little
of
that
hatred
in
all
this

<EOS>
It
end
in
my
determining
to
keep
the
nightgown
,
and
to
wait
,
and
watch
,
and
see
what
use
I
may
make
of
it

time

idea

my
head

you
have
steal
the
Diamond

<EOS>
there
,
I
break
off
in
the
reading
of
the
letter
for
the
second
time

<EOS>
I
have
read
those
portion
of
the
miserable
woman
's
confession
which
relate
to
myself
,
with
unaffected
surprise
,
and
,
I
can
honestly
add
,
with
sincere
distress
.
<EOS>
I
have
regret
,
truly
regretted
,
the
aspersion
which
I
have
thoughtlessly
cast
on
her
memory
,
before
I
have
see
a
line
of
her
letter
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
have
advance
as
far
as
the
passage
which
be
quote
above
,
I
own
<EOS>
I
feel
my
mind
grow
bitterer
and
bitterer
against
Rosanna
Spearman
as
I
go
on
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
read
the
rest
for
yourself
,

I
say
,
hand
the
letter
to
Betteredge
across
the
table

there
be
anything
in

I

you

in

no

natural

"
  
<EOS>
I
proceed
to
copy
the
continuation
of
the
letter
from
the
original
,
in
my
own
possession
:
    
"
have
determined
to
keep
the
nightgown
,

to
see
what
use
my
love

my
revenge
(
I
hardly
know
which
)
could
turn
it
to
in
the
future

next
thing
to
discover
be
how
to
keep
it
without
the
risk
of
be
find
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
only
one
way
 
to
make
another
nightgown
exactly
like
it
,
before
Saturday
come
,
and
bring
the
laundry
-
woman
and
her
inventory
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
to
put
it
off
till
next
day
(
the
Friday
)
;
be
in
doubt
lest
some
accident
may
happen
in
the
interval
.
<EOS>
I
determine
to
make
the
new
nightgown
on
that
same
day
(
the
Thursday
)
,
while
I
could
count
,
if
I
play
my
card
properly
,
on
have
my
time
to
myself
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
to
do
(
after
lock
up
your
nightgown
in
my
drawer
)
be
to
go
back
to
your
bed
-
room
 
not
so
much
to
put
it
to
right
<EOS>
(
Penelope
would
have
do
that
for
me
,
if
I
have
ask
her
)
as
to
find
out
whether
you
have
smear
off
any
of
the
paint
-
stain
from
your
nightgown
,
on
the
bed
,
or
on
any
piece
of
furniture
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
examine
everything
narrowly
,
and
at
last
,
I
find
a
few
streak
of
the
paint
on
the
inside
of
your
dressing
-
gown
 
not
the
linen
<EOS>
dressing
-
gown
you
usually
wear
in
that
summer
season
,
but
a
flannel
dressing
-
gown
which
you
have
with
you
also
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
feel
chilly
after
walk
to
and
fro
in
nothing
but
your
nightdress
,
and
put
on
the
warm
thing
you
could
find
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
there
be
the
stain
,
just
visible
,
on
the
inside
of
the
dressing
-
gown
.
<EOS>
I
easily
get
rid
of
these
by
scrape
away
the
stuff
of
the
flannel
.
<EOS>
this
do
,
the
only
proof
leave
against
you
be
the
proof
lock
up
in
my
drawer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
finish
your
room
when
I
be
send
for
to
be
question
by
Mr.
Seegrave
,
along
with
the
rest
of
the
servant
.
<EOS>
next
come
the
examination
of
all
our
box
.
<EOS>
and
then
follow
the
most
extraordinary
event
of
the
day
 
to
me
 
since
I
have
find
the
paint
on
your
nightgown
.
<EOS>
this
event
come
out
of
the
second
questioning
of
Penelope
Betteredge
by
Superintendent
Seegrave
.
  
<EOS>
"
Penelope
return
to
us
quite
beside
herself
with
rage
at
the
manner
in
which
Mr.
Seegrave
have
treat
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
hint
,
beyond
the
possibility
of
mistake
him
,
that
he
suspect
her
of
be
the
thief
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
equally
astonished
at
hear
this
,
and
we
all
ask
,
<EOS>
why
?
  
"
"
because
the
Diamond
be
in
Miss
Rachel
's
sitting
-
room
,
"
Penelope
answer
.
<EOS>
"
and
because
I
be
the
last
person
in
the
sitting
-
room
at
night
!
"
  
"
almost
before
the
word
have
leave
her
lip
,
I
remember
that
another
person
have
be
in
the
sit
-
room
later
than
Penelope
.
<EOS>
that
person
be
yourself
.
<EOS>
My
head
whirl
round
,
and
my
thought
be
in
dreadful
confusion
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
it
all
,
something
in
my
mind
whisper
to
me
that
the
smear
on
your
nightgown
may
have
a
meaning
entirely
different
to
the
meaning
which
I
have
give
to
it
up
to
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
if
the
last
person
who
be
in
the
room
be
the
person
to
be
suspect
,
"
I
think
to
myself
,
"
the
thief
be
not
Penelope
,
but
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
case
of
any
other
gentleman
,
I
believe
I
should
have
be
ashamed
of
suspect
him
of
theft
,
almost
as
soon
as
the
suspicion
have
pass
through
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
bare
think
that
you
have
let
yourself
down
to
my
level
,
and
that
I
,
in
possess
myself
of
your
nightgown
,
have
also
possess
myself
of
the
mean
of
shield
you
from
be
discover
,
and
disgrace
for
life
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
sir
,
the
bare
thought
of
this
seem
to
open
such
a
chance
before
me
of
win
your
good
will
,
that
I
pass
blindfold
,
as
one
may
say
,
from
suspect
to
believe
.
<EOS>
I
make
up
my
mind
,
on
the
spot
,
that
you
have
show
yourself
the
busy
of
anybody
in
fetch
the
police
,
as
a
blind
to
deceive
us
all
;
and
that
the
hand
which
have
take
Miss
Rachel
's
jewel
could
by
no
possibility
be
any
other
hand
than
yours
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
excitement
of
this
new
discovery
of
mine
must
,
I
think
,
have
turn
my
head
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
I
feel
such
a
devour
eagerness
to
see
you
 
to
try
you
with
a
word
or
two
about
the
Diamond
,
and
to
MAKE
you
look
at
me
,
and
speak
to
me
,
in
that
way
 
that
I
put
my
hair
tidy
,
and
make
myself
as
nice
as
I
could
,
and
go
to
you
boldly
in
the
library
where
I
know
you
be
write
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
leave
one
of
your
ring
up
-
stair
,
which
make
as
good
an
excuse
for
my
intrusion
as
I
could
have
desire
.
<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
if
you
have
ever
love
,
you
will
understand
how
it
be
that
all
my
courage
cool
,
when
I
walk
into
the
room
,
and
find
myself
in
your
presence
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
you
look
up
at
me
so
coldly
,
and
you
thank
me
for
find
your
ring
in
such
an
indifferent
manner
,
that
my
knee
tremble
under
me
,
and
I
feel
as
if
I
should
drop
on
the
floor
at
your
foot
.
<EOS>
when
you
have
thank
me
,
you
look
back
,
if
you
remember
,
at
your
writing
.

I
be
so
mortified
at
be
treat
in
this
way
<EOS>
,
that
I
pluck
up
spirit
enough
to
speak
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
this
be
a
strange
thing
about
the
Diamond
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
and
you
look
up
again
,
and
say
,
"
yes
,
it
be
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
speak
civilly
(
I
can
not
deny
that
)
;
but
still
you
keep
a
distance
 
a
cruel
distance
between
us
.
<EOS>
believe
,
as
I
do
,
that
you
have
get
the
lost
Diamond
hide
about
you
,
while
you
be
speak
,
your
coolness
so
provoke
me
that
I
get
bold
enough
,
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
,
to
give
you
a
hint
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
They
will
never
find
the
Diamond
,
sir
,
will
they
?
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
nor
the
person
who
take
it
 
I
will
answer
for
that
.

I
nod
,
and
smile
at
you
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
I
know
!
"
<EOS>
this
time
,
you
look
up
at
me
with
something
like
interest
in
your
eye
;
and
I
feel
that
a
few
more
word
on
your
side
and
mine
may
bring
out
the
truth
.
<EOS>
just
at
that
moment

Mr.
Betteredge
spoilt
it
all
by
come
to
the
door

know
his
footstep
,

I
also
know
that
it
be
against
his
rule
for
me
to
be
in
the
library
at
that
time
of
day
 
let
alone
be
there
along
with
you
.

I
have
only
just
time
to
get
out
of
my
own
accord
,
before
he
could
come
in
and
tell
me
to
go
.

I
be
angry
and
disappointed
;

I
be
not
entirely
without
hope
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
the
ice
,
you
see
,
be
break
between
us

I
think
I
would
take
care
,
on
the
next
occasion

that
Mr.

be
out
of
the
way

<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
hurry
you
 
<EOS>
but
would
you
mind
tell
me
,
in
one
word
,
whether
you
see
your
way
out
of
this
dreadful
mess
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
my
way
back
to
London
,
"
I
say
,
"
to
consult
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
if
he
can
not
help
me
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
?
"
  
"
and
if
the
Sergeant
will
not
leave
his
retirement
at
Dorking
 
"
  
"
He
will
not
,
Mr.
Franklin
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
Betteredge
 
as
far
as
I
can
see
now
 
<EOS>
I
be
at
the
end
of
my
resource
.
<EOS>
after
Mr.
Bruff
and
the
Sergeant
,
I
do
not
know
of
a
live
creature
who
can
be
of
the
slight
use
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
the
word
pass
my
lip
,
some
person
outside
knock
at
the
door
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
look
surprised
as
well
as
annoy
by
the
interruption
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
"
he
call
out
,
irritably
,
"
whoever
you
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
door
open
,
and
there
enter
to
us
,
quietly
,
the
most
remarkable
-
looking
man
that
I
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
judge
him
by
his
figure
and
his
movement
,
he
be
still
young
.
<EOS>
judge
him
by
his
face
,
and
compare
him
with
Betteredge
,
he
look
the
elder
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
be
of
a
gipsy
darkness
;
his
fleshless
cheek
have
fall
into
deep
hollow
,
over
which
the
bone
project
like
a
pent
-
house
.
<EOS>
His
nose
present
the
fine
shape
and
modelling
so
often
find
among
the
ancient
people
of
the
East
,
so
seldom
visible
among
the
new
race
of
the
West
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
rise
high
and
straight
from
the
brow
.
<EOS>
His
mark
and
wrinkle
be
innumerable
.
<EOS>
from
this
strange
face
,
eye
,
stranger
still
,
of
the
soft
brown
 
eye
dreamy
and
mournful
,
and
deeply
sink
in
their
orbit
 
look
out
at
you
,
and
(
in
my
case
,
at
least
)
take
your
attention
captive
at
their
will
.
<EOS>
add
to
this
a
quantity
of
thick
closely
-
curl
hair
,
which
,
by
some
freak
of
Nature
,
have
lose
its
colour
in
the
most
startlingly
partial
and
capricious
manner
.
<EOS>
over
the
top
of
his
head
it
be
still
of
the
deep
black
which
be
its
natural
colour
.
<EOS>
round
the
side
of
his
head
 
without
the
slight
gradation
of
grey
to
break
the
force
of
the
extraordinary
contrast
 
it
have
turn
completely
white
.
<EOS>
the
line
between
the
two
colour
preserve
no
sort
of
regularity
.
<EOS>
at
one
place
,
the
white
hair
run
up
into
the
black
;
at
another
,
the
black
hair
run
down
into
the
white
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
man
with
a
curiosity
which
,
I
be
ashamed
to
say
<EOS>
,
I
find
it
quite
impossible
to
control
.
<EOS>
His
soft
brown
eye
look
back
at
me
gently
;
and
he
meet
my
involuntary
rudeness
in
stare
at
him
,
with
an
apology
which
I
be
conscious
that
I
have
not
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
idea
that
Mr.
Betteredge
be
engage
.
"
<EOS>
He
take
a
slip
of
paper
from
his
pocket
,
and
hand
it
to
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
"
the
list
for
next
week
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
His
eye
just
rest
on
me
again
 
<EOS>
and
he
leave
the
room
as
quietly
as
he
have
enter
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
that
?
<EOS>

I
ask

hear
that

that
illness

home
from
the
birthday
dinner

<EOS>
He
be
pretty
well
in
health

but
he
lose
his
memory
in
the
fever
,
and
he
have
never
recover
more
than
the
wreck
of
it
since

<EOS>
the
work

<EOS>
not
much
of
it
now
,
except
among
the
poor

<EOS>
they
can
not
help
themselves
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
they
must
put
up
with
the
man
with
the
piebald
hair
,
and
the
gipsy
complexion
 
or
they
would
get
no
doctoring
at
all

well
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
his
appearance
be
against
him

to
begin
with

<EOS>
and
then
there
be
a
story
that
Mr.
Candy
take
him
with
a
very
doubtful
character
.
<EOS>
nobody
know
who
he
be
 
<EOS>
and
he
have
not

how
can
you
expect
one
to
like
him
,
after
that
?

"
<EOS>
quite
impossible
,
of

May
I
ask
what
he
want
with
you
,
when
he
give
you
that
bit
of
paper
?

in

He
put
on

his

gloomily

Mr.

strong
an
impression

me
to
be
immediately
dismiss
from
my
thought

I
pass
over
the
last
unanswerable
utterance

Betteredge

to
the
subject

summon
composure
enough
to
plan
out
for

future

<EOS>
to
go
back
to
London
that
day

to
put
the
whole
case
before
Mr.

,
last

most
important

to
obtain
(
no

there
be
more
than
an
hour
still
to
spare
before
the
train
start

there
be
the
bare
chance
that
Betteredge
may
discover
something
in
the
unread
portion
of
Rosanna
Spearman

letter
,
which
it
may
be
useful
for
me
to
know
before

if
I
do

some
little
triumph
at

that
I
hold
all
your
prospect
in
life
in
my
own
hand

<EOS>
anxiety
and
fear
soon
come
back
to
me

<EOS>
with
the
view

of
the
loss
of
the
Diamond

would
be
sure
to
end
in
examine
our
linen

our
dress

be
no

I
could

be
safe
from
him

<EOS>
how
to
hide
the
nightgown
so
that
not
even
the
Sergeant
could
find
it
?
<EOS>
and
how
to
do
that
without
lose
one
moment
of
precious
time
?

these
be
not
easy
question
to
answer

My
uncertainty

in
my
take

may
make
you
laugh

undress

put
the
nightgown
on
me

You
have
wear
it

another
little
moment

pleasure

wear
it

Sergeant

come
across
each

once
in
former
day

be
certain

would

again

house

a
valuable
jewel
have
be

<EOS>
in
this
suspense

I
feel
it
would
be
a
relief
to
me
to
get
the
meeting
between

over

bad
of

he
be
very
specially
polite

me
for
bring

those
be
both
bad

It
be
then
time
for
your
return
from

Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
off
by
the
railway

I
go
to
your
favourite
walk

tell
you
already

thing
go
on
in

bear
Mr.

into

not

stop
you

you
avoid
me

cruel
manner

do
not
I
call
out
,
"
Mr.
Franklin
,
I
have
get
something
to
say
to
you
;
it
concern
yourself
,
and
you
must
,

shall
,
hear
it
?

You
be
at
my

have
get
the
whip

you

be
useful

you

I
never
suppose

you

steal
the
Diamond

it

no

Penelope
have
hear
Miss
Rachel

I
have
hear
Mr.

talk
about
your
extravagance

your
debt

It
be
plain
enough
to
me

you
have
take
the
Diamond
to
sell
it
,

pledge
it

so
to
get
the
money

which
you
stand

could
have
tell

it

I
wonder
whether
the
risk
and
difficulty
of
keep
the
nightgown
be
as
much
as
I
could
manage
,
without

other
risk

add
to
them

this
may
have
be
the

how
could
it
be

thief

I
have
run
fifty
time
great
risk

find
my
way
out

this
difficulty
be
mere
child

to
fraud

of

grand
scale

manage
so
cleverly

that
they
become
famous
,

appear
in

be
such
a
little
thing
as
the
keeping
of
the
nightgown
likely
to
weigh
on
my
spirit
,

to
set
my
heart
sink
within
me
,
at
the
time
when
I
ought
to
have
speak
to
you

what
nonsense
to
ask
the

not

the
use

folly

plain
enough

She

speak
those
cruel
word

all
the
indoor
servant
be
to
assemble
in

hall

then
we
be
to
go
in

one
by
one
,

be
question
in
Mr.

room
by
Sergeant
Cuff

It
come
to
my
turn

go
in

her
ladyship

maid

the
upper
housemaid
have
be
question
first
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
's
inquiry
 
though
he
wrap
them
up
very
cunningly
 
soon
show
me
that
those
two
woman
(
the
bitter
enemy
I
have
in

house
)
have
make
their
discovery
outside
my
door
,
on
the
Tuesday
afternoon
,

again
on
the
Thursday
night

They
have
tell
the
Sergeant
enough
to
open
his
eye
to
some
part
of
the
truth

He
rightly
believe
me
to
have
make
a
new
nightgown
secretly
,
but
he
wrongly
believe
the
paint
-
stain
nightgown
to
be
mine
.
<EOS>
I
feel
satisfied
of
another
thing
,
from
what
he
say
,
which
it
puzzle
me
to
understand
.
<EOS>
He
suspect
me
,
of
course
,
of
be
concern
in
the
disappearance
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
let
me
see
 
purposely
,
as
I
think
 
that
he
do
not
consider
me
as
the
person
chiefly
answerable
for
the
loss
of
the
jewel
.
<EOS>
He
appear
to
think
that
I
have
be
act
under
the
direction
of
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
who
that
person
may
be
,
I
could
not
guess
then
,

can
not
guess
now

"
in
this
uncertainty
,
one
thing
be
plain
 
that
Sergeant
Cuff
be
mile
away
from
know
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
You
be
safe
as
long
as
the
nightgown
be
safe
 
and
not
a
moment
longer

I
quite
despair
of
make
you
understand
the
distress
and
terror
which
press
upon
me
now

<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
risk
wear
your
nightgown
any
longer

<EOS>
I
may
find
myself
take
off
,
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
to
the
police
court
at
Frizinghall
,
to
be
charge
on
suspicion
,
and
search
accordingly
.
<EOS>
while
Sergeant
Cuff
still
leave
me
free
,
I
have
to
choose
 
and
at
once
 
between
destroy
the
nightgown
,
or
hide
it
in
some
safe
place
,
at
some
safe
distance
from
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
only
be
a
little
less
fond
of
you
,
I
think
I
should
have
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
but
oh
!
<EOS>
how
could
I
destroy
the
only
thing
I
have
which
prove
that
I
have
save
you
from
discovery
?
<EOS>
if
we
do
come
to
an
explanation
together
,
and
if
you
suspect
me
of
have
some
bad
motive
,
and
deny
it
all
<EOS>
,
how
could
I
win
upon
you
to
trust
me
,
unless
I
have
the
nightgown
to
produce
?
<EOS>
be
it
wrong
you
to
believe
,
as
I
do
and
do
still
,
that
you
may
hesitate
to
let
a
poor
girl
like
me
be
the
sharer
of
your
secret
,
and
your
accomplice
in
the
theft
which
your
money
-
trouble
have
tempt
you
to
commit
?
<EOS>
think
of
your
cold
behaviour
to
me
,
sir
,
and
you
will
hardly
wonder
at
my
unwillingness
to
destroy
the
only
claim
on
your
confidence
and
your
gratitude
which
it
be
my
fortune
to
possess

<EOS>

I
determine
to
hide
it

the
place
I
fix
on

the
place

know
best

Shivering
Sand

soon
as
the
questioning
be
over

come
into

leave

go
out

breath

fresh
air

to
write
this
letter

to
have
a
safe
opportunity
of
take
the
nightgown
off
me

as
I
be

could
do
neither

those
thing
with
any

security

up

nothing
to
guide
you
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
"
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
keep
the
letter
in
the
cover
till
these
present
anxiety
of
your
have
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
It
will
sorely
distress
you
,
whenever
you
read
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
read
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
the
letter
away
in
my
pocket
-
book
.
  
<EOS>
a
glance
back
at
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
chapter
of
Betteredge
's
Narrative
will
show
that
there
really
be
a
reason
for
my
thus
spare
myself
,
at
a
time
when
my
fortitude
have
be
already
cruelly
try
.
<EOS>
twice
over
,
the
unhappy
woman
have
make
her
last
attempt
to
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
and
twice
over
,
it
have
be
my
misfortune
(
God
know
how
innocently
!
)
to
repel
the
advance
she
have
make
to
me
.
<EOS>
on
the
Friday
night
,
as
Betteredge
truly
describe
it
,
she
have
find
me
alone
at
the
billiard
-
table
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
and
language
suggest
to
me
and
would
have
suggest
to
any
man
,
under
the
circumstance
 
that
she
be
about
to
confess
a
guilty
knowledge
of
the
disappearance
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
for
her
own
sake
,
I
have
purposely
show
no
special
interest
in
what
be
come
;
for
her
own
sake
,
I
have
purposely
look
at
the
billiard
-
ball
,
instead
of
look
at
HER
 
and
what
have
be
the
result
?
<EOS>
I
have
send
her
away
from
me
,
wound
to
the
heart
!
<EOS>
on
the
Saturday
again
 
on
the
day
when
she
must
have
foresee
,
after
what
Penelope
have
tell
her
,
that
my
departure
be
close
at
hand
 
<EOS>
the
same
fatality
still
pursue
us
.
<EOS>
She
have
once
more
attempt
to
meet
me
in
the
shrubbery
walk
,
and
she
have
find
me
there
in
company
with
Betteredge
and
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
in
her
hearing
,
the
Sergeant
,
with
his
own
underhand
object
in
view
,
have
appeal
to
my
interest
in
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
again
for
the
poor
creature
's
own
sake
,
I
have
meet
the
police
-
officer
with
a
flat
denial
,
and
have
declare
 
loudly
declare
,
so
that
she
may
hear
me
too
 
that
I
feel
"
no
interest
whatever
in
Rosanna
Spearman
.
<EOS>
"
at
those
word
,
solely
design
to
warn
her
against
attempt
to
gain
my
private
ear
,
she
have
turn
away
and
leave
the
place
:
caution
of
her
danger
,
as
I
then
believe
;
self
-
doom
to
destruction
,
as
I
know
now
.
<EOS>
from
that
point
,
I
have
already
trace
the
succession
of
event
which
lead
me
to
the
astounding
discovery
at
the
quicksand
.
<EOS>
the
retrospect
be
now
complete
.
<EOS>
I
may
leave
the
miserable
story
of
Rosanna
Spearman
 
to
which
,
even
at
this
distance
of
time
,
I
can
not
revert
without
a
pang
of
distress
 
to
suggest
for
itself
all
that
be
here
purposely
leave
unsaid
.
<EOS>
I
may
pass
from
the
suicide
at
the
Shivering
Sand
,
with
its
strange
and
terrible
influence
on
my
present
position
and
future
prospect
,
to
interest
which
concern
the
live
people
of
this
narrative
,
and
to
event
which
be
already
pave
my
way
for
the
slow
and
toilsome
journey
from
the
darkness
to
the
light
.
    
<EOS>
I
walk
to
the
railway
station
accompany
,
it
be
needless
to
say
,
by
Gabriel
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
letter
in
my
pocket
,
and
the
nightgown
safely
pack
in
a
little
bag
 
both
to
be
submit
,
before
I
sleep
that
night
,
to
the
investigation
of
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
We
leave
the
house
in
silence
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
in
my
experience
of
him
,
I
find
old
Betteredge
in
my
company
without
a
word
to
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
have
something
to
say
on
my
side
,
I
open
the
conversation
as
soon
as
we
be
clear
of
the
lodge
gate
.
  
<EOS>
"
before
I
go
to
London
,
"
I
begin
,
"
I
have
two
question
to
ask
you
.
<EOS>
They
relate
to
myself
,
and
I
believe
they
will
rather
surprise
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
they
will
put
that
poor
creature
's
letter
out
of
my
head
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
they
may
do
anything
else
they
like
with
me
.
<EOS>
please
to
begin
surprise
me
,
sir
,
as
soon
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
first
question
,
Betteredge
,
be
this
.
<EOS>
be
I
drunk
on
the
night
of
Rachel
's
birthday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
you
drunk
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
it
be
the
great
defect
of
your
character
,
Mr.
Franklin
that
you
only
drink
with
your
dinner
,
and
never
touch
a
drop
of
liquor
afterwards
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
birthday
be
a
special
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
abandon
my
regular
habit
,
on
that
night
of
all
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
consider
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
go
out
of
your
habit
,
sir
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
will
tell
you
how
.
<EOS>
You
look
wretchedly
ill
 
<EOS>
and
we
persuade
you
to
have
a
drop
of
brandy
and
water
to
cheer
you
up
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
use
to
brandy
and
water
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
possible
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
wait
a
bit
,
Mr.
Franklin
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
be
not
use
,
too
.
<EOS>
I
pour
you
out
half
a
wineglass
-
full
of
our
fifty
year
old
Cognac
;
and
(
more
shame
for
me
!
)
<EOS>
I
drown
that
noble
liquor
in
nigh
on
a
tumbler
-
full
of
cold
water
.
<EOS>
a
child
could
not
have
get
drunk
on
it
 
<EOS>
let
alone
a
grown
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
know
I
could
depend
on
his
memory
,
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
It
be
plainly
impossible
that
I
could
have
be
intoxicate
.
<EOS>
I
pass
on
to
the
second
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
before
I
be
send
abroad
,
Betteredge
,
you
see
a
great
deal
of
me
when
I
be
a
boy
?
<EOS>
now
tell
me
plainly
,
do
you
remember
anything
strange
of
me
,
after
I
have
go
to
bed
at
night
?
<EOS>
do
you
ever
discover
me
walk
in
my
sleep
?
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
stop
,
look
at
me
for
a
moment
,
nod
his
head
,
and
walk
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
your
drift
now
,
Mr.
Franklin
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
"
You
be
try
to
account
for
how
you
get
the
paint
on
your
nightgown
,
without
know
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
be
mile
away
still
from
get
at
the
truth
.
<EOS>
walk
in
your
sleep
?
<EOS>
You
never
do
such
a
thing
in
your
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
here
again
,
I
feel
that
Betteredge
must
be
right
.
<EOS>
neither
at
home
nor
abroad
have
my
life
ever
be
of
the
solitary
sort
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
a
sleep
-
walker
,
there
be
hundred
on
hundred
of
people
who
must
have
discover
me
,
and
who
,
in
the
interest
of
my
own
safety
,
would
have
warn
me
of
the
habit
,
and
have
take
precaution
to
restrain
it
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
admit
all
this
,
I
cling
 
with
an
obstinacy
which
be
surely
natural
and
excusable
,
under
the
circumstance
 
to
one
or
other
of
the
only
two
explanation
that
I
could
see
which
account
for
the
unendurable
position
in
which
I
then
stand
.
<EOS>
observe
that
I
be
not
yet
satisfied
,
Betteredge
shrewdly
advert
to
certain
later
event
in
the
history
of
the
Moonstone
;
and
scatter
both
my
theory
to
the
wind
at
once
and
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
's
try
it
another
way
,
sir
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
keep
your
own
opinion
,
and
see
how
far
it
will
take
you
towards
find
out
the
truth
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
to
believe
the
nightgown
 
<EOS>
which
I
do
not
for
one
 
<EOS>
you
not
only
smear
off
the
paint
from
the
door
,
without
know
it
,
but
you
also
take
the
Diamond
without
know
it
.
<EOS>
be
that
right
,
so
far
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
right
.
<EOS>
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
sir
.
<EOS>
We
will
say
you
be
drunk
,
or
walk
in
your
sleep
,
when
you
take
the
jewel
.
<EOS>
that
account
for
the
night
and
morning
,
after
the
birthday
.
<EOS>
but
how
do
it
account
for
what
have
happen
since
that
time
?
<EOS>
the
Diamond
have
be
take
to
London
,
since
that
time
.
<EOS>
the
Diamond
have
be
pledge
to
Mr.
Luker
,
since
that
time
.
<EOS>
do
you
do
those
two
thing
,
without
know
it
,
too
?
<EOS>
be
you
drunk
when
I
see
you
off
in
the
pony
-
chaise
on
that
Saturday
evening
?
<EOS>
and
do
you
walk
in
your
sleep
to
Mr.
Luker
's
,
when
the
train
have
bring
you
to
your
journey
's
end
?
<EOS>
excuse
me
for
say
it
,
Mr.
Franklin
,
but
this
business
have
so
upset
you
,
that
you
be
not
fit
yet
to
judge
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
the
sooner
you
lay
your
head
alongside
Mr.
Bruff
's
head
,
the
sooner
you
will
see
your
way
out
of
the
dead
-
lock
that
have
get
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
reach
the
station
,
with
only
a
minute
or
two
to
spare
.
  
<EOS>
I
hurriedly
give
Betteredge
my
address
in
London
,
so
that
he
may
write
to
me
,
if
necessary
;
promise
,
on
my
side
,
to
inform
him
of
any
news
which
I
may
have
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
this
done
,
and
just
as
I
be
bid
him
farewell
,
I
happen
to
glance
towards
the
book
-
and
-
newspaper
stall
.
<EOS>
there
be
Mr.
Candy
's
remarkable
-
look
assistant
again
,
speak
to
the
keeper
of
the
stall
!
<EOS>
Our
eye
meet
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
take
off
his
hat
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
return
the
salute
,
and
get
into
a
carriage
just
as
the
train
start
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
relief
to
my
mind
,
I
suppose
,
to
dwell
on
any
subject
which
appear
to
be
,
personally
,
of
no
sort
of
importance
to
me
.
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
I
begin
the
momentous
journey
back
which
be
to
take
me
to
Mr.
Bruff
,
wonder
 
absurdly
enough
,
I
admit
 
that
I
should
have
see
the
man
with
the
piebald
hair
twice
in
one
day
!
  
<EOS>
the
hour
at
which
I
arrive
in
London
preclude
all
hope
of
my
finding
Mr.
Bruff
at
his
place
of
business
.
<EOS>
I
drive
from
the
railway
to
his
private
residence
at
Hampstead
,
and
disturb
the
old
lawyer
doze
alone
in
his
dining
-
room
,
with
his
favourite
pug
-
dog
on
his
lap
,
and
his
bottle
of
wine
at
his
elbow
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
best
describe
the
effect
which
my
story
produce
on
the
mind
of
Mr.
Bruff
by
relate
his
proceeding
when
he
have
hear
it
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
He
order
light
,
and
strong
tea
,
to
be
take
into
his
study
;
and
he
send
a
message
to
the
lady
of
his
family
,
forbid
them
to
disturb
us
on
any
pretence
whatever
.
<EOS>
these
preliminary
dispose
of
<EOS>
,
he
first
examine
the
nightgown
,
and
then
devote
himself
to
the
reading
of
Rosanna
Spearman
's
letter
.
  
<EOS>
the
reading
complete
,
Mr.
Bruff
address
me
for
the
first
time
since
we
have
be
shut
up
together
in
the
seclusion
of
his
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Franklin
Blake
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
,
"
this
be
a
very
serious
matter
,
in
more
respect
than
one
.
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
it
concern
Rachel
quite
as
nearly
as
it
concern
you
.
<EOS>
Her
extraordinary
conduct
be
no
mystery
now
.
<EOS>
She
believe
you
have
steal
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
shrink
from
reason
my
own
way
fairly
to
that
revolt
conclusion
.
<EOS>
but
it
have
force
itself
on
me
,
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
My
resolution
to
obtain
a
personal
interview
with
Rachel
,
rest
really
and
truly
on
the
ground
just
state
by
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
first
step
to
take
in
this
investigation
,
"
the
lawyer
proceed
,
"
be
to
appeal
to
Rachel
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
silent
all
this
time
,
from
motive
which
I
(
who
know
her
character
)
can
readily
understand
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
,
after
what
have
happen
,
to
submit
to
that
silence
any
longer
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
persuade
to
tell
us
,
or
she
must
be
force
to
tell
us
,
on
what
ground
she
base
her
belief
that
you
take
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
the
chance
be
,
that
the
whole
of
this
case
,
serious
as
it
seem
now
,
will
tumble
to
piece
,
if
we
can
only
break
through
Rachel
's
inveterate
reserve
,
and
prevail
upon
her
to
speak
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
very
comforting
opinion
for
_
me
_
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
own
I
should
like
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
like
to
know
how
I
can
justify
it
,
"
inter
-
pose
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
you
in
two
minute
.
<EOS>
understand
,
in
the
first
place
,
that
I
look
at
this
matter
from
a
lawyer
's
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
question
of
evidence
,
with
me
.
<EOS>
very
well
.
<EOS>
the
evidence
break
down
,
at
the
outset
,
on
one
important
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
what
point
?
"
  
"
You
shall
hear
.
<EOS>
I
admit
that
the
mark
of
the
name
prove
the
nightgown
to
be
yours
.
<EOS>
I
admit
that
the
mark
of
the
paint
prove
the
nightgown
to
have
make
the
smear
on
Rachel
's
door
.
<EOS>
but
what
evidence
be
there
to
prove
that
you
be
the
person
who
wear
it
,
on
the
night
when
the
Diamond
be
lose
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
objection
strike
me
,
all
the
more
forcibly
that
it
reflect
an
objection
which
I
have
feel
myself
.

"
as
to

I
can
understand
that
the
letter
be
a
distress
one
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
understand
that
you
may
hesitate
to
analyse
it
from
a
purely
impartial
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
in
your
position
.
<EOS>
I
can
bring
my
professional
experience
to
bear
on
this
document
,
just
as
I
should
bring
it
to
bear
on
any
other
.
<EOS>
without
allude
to
the
woman
's
career
as
a
thief
,
I
will
merely
remark
that
her
letter
prove
her
to
have
be
an
adept
at
deception
,
on
her
own
showing
;
and
I
argue
from
that
,
that
I
be
justified
in
suspect
her
of
not
have
tell
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
start
any
theory
,
at
present
,
as
to
what
she
may
or
may
not
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
say
that
,
if
Rachel
have
suspect
you
on
the
evidence
of
the
NIGHTGOWN
ONLY
,
the
chance
be
ninety
-
nine
to
a
hundred
that
Rosanna
Spearman
be
the
person
who
show
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
there
be
the
woman
's
letter
,
confess
that
she
be
jealous
of
Rachel
,
confess
that
she
change
the
rose
,
confess
that
she
see
a
glimpse
of
hope
for
herself
,
in
the
prospect
of
a
quarrel
between
Rachel
and
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
stop
to
ask
who
take
the
Moonstone
(
as
a
means
to
her
end
,
Rosanna
Spearman
would
have
take
fifty
moonstone
)
 
<EOS>
I
only
say
that
the
disappearance
of
the
jewel
give
this
reclaim
thief
who
be
in
love
with
you
,
an
opportunity
of
set
you
and
Rachel
at
variance
for
the
rest
of
your
life
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
decide
on
destroy
herself
,
then
,
remember
;
and
,
have
the
opportunity
,
I
distinctly
assert
that
it
be
in
her
character
,
and
in
her
position
at
the
time
,
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
some
such
suspicion
<EOS>
,
"
I
answer
,
"
cross
my
own
mind
,
as
soon
as
I
open
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
exactly
!
<EOS>
and
when
you
have
read
the
letter
,
you
pity
the
poor
creature
,
and
could
not
find
it
in
your
heart
to
suspect
her
.
<EOS>
do
you
credit
,
my
dear
sir
 
<EOS>
do
you
credit
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
suppose
it
turn
out
that
I
do
wear
the
nightgown
?
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
how
the
fact
can
be
prove
,
"
say
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
assume
the
proof
to
be
possible
,
the
vindication
of
your
innocence
would
be
no
easy
matter
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
go
into
that
,
now
.
<EOS>
let
us
wait
and
see
whether
Rachel
have
not
suspect
you
on
the
evidence
of
the
nightgown
only
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
,
how
coolly
you
talk
of
Rachel
suspect
me
!
<EOS>
"
I
break
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
right
have
she
to
suspect
Me
,
on
any
evidence
,
of
be
a
thief
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
sensible
question
,
my
dear
sir

<EOS>
rather
hotly
put
 
<EOS>
but
well
worth
consider
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
what
puzzle
you
,
puzzle
me
too
.
<EOS>
search
your
memory

and
tell
me
this

anything
happen

you
be
stay
at
the
house
 
not
,
of
course
,
to
shake
Rachel
's
belief
in
your
honour
 
<EOS>
but
,
let
us
say
,
to
shake
her
belief
(
no
matter
with
how
little
reason
)
in
your
principle
generally
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
start
,
in
ungovernable
agitation
,
to
my
foot
.
<EOS>
the
lawyer
's
question
remind
me
,
for
the
first
time
since
I
have
leave
England
,
that
something
have
happen
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
eighth
chapter
of
Betteredge
's
Narrative
,
an
allusion
will
be
find
to
the
arrival
of
a
foreigner
and
a
stranger
at
my
aunt
's
house
,
who
come
to
see
me
on
business
.
<EOS>
the
nature
of
his
business
be
this
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
foolish
enough
(
be
,
as
usual
,
straiten
for
money
at
the
time
)
to
accept
a
loan
from
the
keeper
of
a
small
restaurant
in
Paris
,
to
whom
I
be
well
know
as
a
customer
.
<EOS>
a
time
be
settle
between
us
for
pay
the
money
back
;
and
when
the
time
come
,
I
find
it
(
as
thousand
of
other
honest
man
have
find
it
)
impossible
to
keep
my
engagement
.
<EOS>
I
send
the
man
a
bill
.
<EOS>
My
name
be
unfortunately
too
well
known
on
such
document
:
he
fail
to
negotiate
it
.
<EOS>
His
affair
have
fall
into
disorder
,
in
the
interval
since
I
have
borrow
of
him
;
bankruptcy
stare
him
in
the
face
;
and
a
relative
of
his
,
a
french
lawyer
,
come
to
England
to
find
me
,
and
to
insist
upon
the
payment
of
my
debt
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
violent
temper
;
and
he
take
the
wrong
way
with
me
.
<EOS>
high
word
pass
on
both
side
;
and
my
aunt
and
Rachel
be
unfortunately
in
the
next
room
,
and
hear
us
.
<EOS>
Lady
Verinder
come
in
,
and
insist
on
know
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
the
Frenchman
produce
his
credential
,
and
declare
me
to
be
responsible
for
the
ruin
of
a
poor
man
,
who
have
trust
in
my
honour
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
instantly
pay
him
the
money
,
and
send
him
off
.
<EOS>
She
know
me
better
of
course
than
to
take
the
Frenchman
's
view
of
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
shock
at
my
carelessness
,
and
justly
angry
with
me
for
place
myself
in
a
position
,
which
,
but
for
her
interference
,
may
have
become
a
very
disgraceful
one
.
<EOS>
either
her
mother
tell
her
,
or
Rachel
hear
what
pass
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
which
.
<EOS>
She
take
her
own
romantic
,
high
-
flown
view
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
be
"
heartless
"
;
I
be
"
dishonourable
"
;
I
have
"
no
principle
"
;
there
be
"
no
know
what
I
may
do
next
<EOS>
"
 
in
short
,
she
say
some
of
the
severe
thing
to
me
which
I
have
ever
hear
from
a
young
lady
's
lip
.
<EOS>
the
breach
between
us
last
for
the
whole
of
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
the
day
after
,
I
succeed
in
make
my
peace
,
and
think
no
more
of
it
.
<EOS>
have
Rachel
revert
to
this
unlucky
accident
,
at
the
critical
moment
when
my
place
in
her
estimation
be
again
,
and
far
more
seriously
,
assail
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
,
when
I
have
mention
the
circumstance
to
him
,
answer
the
question
at
once
in
the
affirmative
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
its
effect
on
her
mind
,
"
he
say
gravely
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
wish
,
for
your
sake
,
the
thing
have
not
happen
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
have
discover
that
there
be
a
predisposing
influence
against
you
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
one
uncertainty
clear
out
of
our
way
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
more
that
we
can
do
now
.
<EOS>
Our
next
step
in
this
inquiry
must
be
the
step
that
take
us
to
Rachel
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
rise
,
and
begin
walk
thoughtfully
up
and
down
the
room
.
<EOS>
twice
,
I
be
on
the
point
of
tell
him
that
I
have
determine
on
see
Rachel
personally
;
and
twice
,
have
regard
to
his
age
and
his
character
,
I
hesitate
to
take
him
by
surprise
at
an
unfavourable
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
grand
difficulty
be
,
"
he
resume
,
"
how
to
make
her
show
her
whole
mind
in
this
matter
,
without
reserve
.
<EOS>
have
you
any
suggestion
to
offer
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
make
up
my
mind
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
to
speak
to
Rachel
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
!
"
<EOS>
He
suddenly
stop
in
his
walk
,
and
look
at
me
as
if
he
think
I
have
take
leave
of
my
sense
.
<EOS>
"
You
,
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
!
"
<EOS>
He
abruptly
check
himself
,
and
take
another
turn
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
wait
a
little
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
in
case
of
this
extraordinary
kind
,
the
rash
way
be
sometimes
the
good
way
.
"
<EOS>
He
consider
the
question
for
a
moment
or
two
,
under
that
new
light
,
and
end
boldly
by
a
decision
in
my
favour
.
"
<EOS>
nothing
venture
,
nothing
have
,
"
the
old
gentleman
resume
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
chance
in
your
favour
which
I
do
not
possess
 
<EOS>
and
you
shall
be
the
first
to
try
the
experiment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
chance
in
my
favour
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
,
in
the
great
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
's
face
soften
,
for
the
first
time
,
into
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
how
it
stand
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
fairly
,
I
do
not
trust
your
discretion
,
and
I
do
not
trust
your
temper
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
trust
in
Rachel
's
still
preserve
,
in
some
remote
little
corner
of
her
heart
,
a
certain
perverse
weakness
for
you
.
<EOS>
touch
that
 
and
trust
to
the
consequence
for
the
full
disclosure
that
can
flow
from
a
woman
's
lip
!
<EOS>
the
question
be
 
how
be
you
to
see
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
be
a
guest
of
yours
at
this
house
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
venture
to
suggest
 
if
nothing
be
say
about
me
<EOS>
beforehand
 
<EOS>
that
I
may
see
her
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
cool
!
"
say
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
with
that
one
word
of
comment
on
the
reply
that
I
have
make
to
him
,
he
take
another
turn
up
and
down
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
plain
English
,
"
he
say
,
"
my
house
be
to
be
turn
into
a
trap
to
catch
Rachel
;
with
a
bait
to
tempt
her
,
in
the
shape
of
an
invitation
from
my
wife
and
daughter
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
anybody
else
but
Franklin
Blake
,
and
if
this
matter
be
one
atom
less
serious
than
it
really

I
should
refuse
point
-
blank

<EOS>
as
thing
be
,
I
firmly
believe
Rachel
will
live
to
thank
me
for
turn
traitor
to
her
in
my
old
age

<EOS>
consider
me
your
accomplice

<EOS>
Rachel
shall

ask
to
spend
the
day
here

shall

due
notice

day

<EOS>

how
shall
I
hear
from
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
stay
at
home
all
the
morning

expect
me
to
call
on
you

<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
the
inestimable
assistance
which
he
be
render
to
me
,
with
the
gratitude
that
I
really
feel
;
and
,
decline
a
hospitable
invitation
to
sleep
that
night
at
Hampstead
,
return
to
my
lodging
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
of
the
day
that
follow
,
I
have
only
to
say
that
it
be
the
long
day
of
my
life

<EOS>
innocent
as
I
know
myself
to
be
,
certain
as
I
be
that
the
abominable
imputation
which
rest
on
me
must
sooner
or
later
be
clear
off
,
there
be
nevertheless
a
sense
of
self
-
abasement
in
my
mind
which
instinctively
disincline
me
to
see
any
of
my
friend
.
<EOS>
We
often
hear
(
almost
invariably
,
however
,
from
superficial
observer
)
that
guilt
can
look
like
innocence
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
to
be
infinitely
the
truer
axiom
of
the
two
that
innocence
can
look
like
guilt
.
<EOS>
I
cause
myself
to
be
deny
all
day
,
to
every
visitor
who
call
;

I
only
venture
out
under
cover

the
night

<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
Mr.
Bruff
surprise
me
at
the
breakfast

table

He
hand
me
a
large
key

announce
that

Candy
hearing
of
this
,
have
himself
drive
over
to
Betteredge
,
to
express
his
regret
at
our
have
miss
each
other
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
reason
for
wish
particularly
to
speak
to
me
;
and
when
I
be
next
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Frizinghall
,
he
beg
I
would
let
him
know
.
<EOS>
apart
from
a
few
characteristic
utterance
of
the
Betteredge
philosophy
,
this
be
the
sum
and
substance
of
my
correspondent
's
letter
.
<EOS>
the
warm
-
hearted
,
faithful
old
man
acknowledge
that
he
have
write
"
mainly
for
the
pleasure
of
write
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
crumple
up
the
letter
in
my
pocket
,
and
forget
it
the
moment
after
,
in
the
all
-
absorb
interest
of
my
coming
interview
with
Rachel
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
clock
of
Hampstead
church
strike
three
,
I
put
Mr.
Bruff
's
key
into
the
lock
of
the
door
in
the
wall
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
step
into
the
garden
,
and
while
I
be
secure
the
door
again
on
the
inner
side
,
I
own
to
have
feel
a
certain
guilty
doubtfulness
about
what
may
happen
next
.
<EOS>
I
look
furtively
on
either
side
of
me
;
suspicious
of
the
presence
of
some
unexpected
witness
in
some
unknown
corner
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
nothing
appear
,
to
justify
my
apprehension
.
<EOS>
the
walk
be
,
one
and
all
,
solitude
;
and
the
bird
and
the
bee
be
the
only
witness
.
  
<EOS>
I
pass
through
the
garden
;
enter
the
conservatory
;
and
cross
the
small
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
as
I
lay
my
hand
on
the
door
opposite
,
I
hear
a
few
plaintive
chord
strike
on
the
piano
in
the
room
within
.
<EOS>
She
have
often
idle
over
the
instrument
in
this
way
,
when
I
be
stay
at
her
mother
's
house
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
wait
a
little
,
to
steady
myself
.
<EOS>
the
past
and
present
rise
side
by
side
,
at
that
supreme
moment
 
and
the
contrast
shake
me
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
lapse
of
a
minute
,
I
rouse
my
manhood
,
and
open
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
at
the
moment
when
I
show
myself
in
the
doorway
,
Rachel
rise
from
the
piano
.
  
<EOS>
I
close
the
door
behind
me
.
<EOS>
We
confront
each
other
in
silence
,
with
the
full
length
of
the
room
between
us
.
<EOS>
the
movement
she
have
make
in
rise
appear
to
be
the
one
exertion
of
which
she
be
capable
.
<EOS>
all
use
of
every
other
faculty
,
bodily
or
mental
,
seem
to
be
merge
in
the
mere
act
of
look
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
a
fear
cross
my
mind
that
I
have
show
myself
too
suddenly
.
<EOS>
I
advance
a
few
step
towards
her
.
<EOS>
I
say
gently
,
"
Rachel
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
sound
of
my
voice
bring
the
life
back
to
her
limb
,
and
the
colour
to
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
advance
,
on
her
side
,
still
without
speak
.
<EOS>
slowly
,
as
if
act
under
some
influence
independent
of
her
own
will
,
she
come
nearer
and
near
to
me
;
the
warm
dusky
colour
flush
her
cheek
,
the
light
of
revive
intelligence
brighten
every
instant
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
I
forget
the
object
that
have
bring
me
into
her
presence
;
I
forget
the
vile
suspicion
that
rest
on
my
good
name
;
I
forget
every
consideration
,
past
,
present
,
and
future
,
which
I
be
bind
to
remember
.
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
but
the
woman
I
love
come
nearer
and
near
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
tremble
;
she
stand
irresolute
.
<EOS>
I
could
resist
it
no
longer
 
<EOS>
I
catch
her
in
my
arm
,
and
cover
her
face
with
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
moment
when
I
think
the
kiss
be
return
;
a
moment
when
it
seem
as
if
she
,
too
may
have
forget
.
<EOS>
almost
before
the
idea
could
shape
itself
in
my
mind
,
her
first
voluntary
action
make
me
feel
that
she
remember
.
<EOS>
with
a
cry
which
be
like
a
cry
of
horror
 
with
a
strength
which
I
doubt
if
I
could
have
resist
if
I
have
try
 
<EOS>
she
thrust
me
back
from
her
.
<EOS>
I
see
merciless
anger
in
her
eye
;
I
see
merciless
contempt
on
her
lip
.
<EOS>
She
look
me
over
,
from
head
to
foot
,
as
she
may
have
look
at
a
stranger
who
have
insult
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
coward
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
mean
,
miserable
,
heartless
coward
!
"
  
<EOS>
those
be
her
first
word
!
<EOS>
the
most
unendurable
reproach
that
a
woman
can
address
to
a
man
,
be
the
reproach
that
she
pick
out
to
address
to
Me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
the
time
,
Rachel
,
"
I
say
,
"
when
you
could
have
tell
me
that
I
have
offend
you
,
in
a
worthy
way
than
that
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
something
of
the
bitterness
that
I
feel
may
have
communicate
itself
to
my
voice
.
<EOS>
at
the
first
word
of
my
reply
,
her
eye
,
which
have
be
turn
away
the
moment
before
,
look
back
at
me
unwillingly
.
<EOS>
She
answer
in
a
low
tone
,
with
a
sullen
submission
of
manner
which
be
quite
new
in
my
experience
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
there
be
some
excuse
for
me
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
after
what
you
have
do
,
be
it
a
manly
action
,
on
your
part
,
to
find
your
way
to
me
as
you
have
find
it
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
It
seem
a
cowardly
experiment
,
to
try
an
experiment
on
my
weakness
for
you
.
<EOS>
It
seem
a
cowardly
surprise
,
to
surprise
me
into
let
you
kiss
me
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
only
a
woman
's
view
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
know
it
could
not
be
your
view
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
do
better
if
I
have
control
myself
,
and
say
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
apology
be
more
unendurable
than
the
insult
.
<EOS>
the
most
degraded
man
living
would
have
feel
humiliate
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
my
honour
be
not
in
your
hand
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
would
leave
you
this
instant
,
and
never
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
You
have
speak
of
what
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
you
do
!
<EOS>
you
ask
that
question
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
keep
your
infamy
a
secret
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
have
suffer
the
consequence
of
conceal
it
.
<EOS>
have
I
no
claim
to
be
spare
the
insult
of
your
ask
me
what
you
have
do
?
<EOS>
be
all
sense
of
gratitude
dead
in
you
?
<EOS>
You
be
once
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
You
be
once
dear
to
my
mother
,
and
dearer
still
to
me
 
"
  
Her
voice
fail
her
.
<EOS>
She
drop
into
a
chair
,
and
turn
her
back
on
me
,
and
cover
her
face
with
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
wait
a
little
before
I
trust
myself
to
say
any
more
.
<EOS>
in
that
moment
of
silence
,
I
hardly
know
which
I
feel
most
keenly
 
<EOS>
the
sting
which
her
contempt
have
plant
in
me
,
or
the
proud
resolution
which
shut
me
out
from
all
community
with
her
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
not
speak
first
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
must
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
with
something
serious
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
do
me
the
common
justice
of
listen
while
I
say
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
neither
move
,
nor
answer
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
second
appeal
to
her
;
I
never
advance
an
inch
nearer
to
her
chair
.
<EOS>
with
a
pride
which
be
as
obstinate
as
her
pride
,
I
tell
her
of
my
discovery
at
the
Shivering
Sand
,
and
of
all
that
have
lead
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
narrative
,
of
necessity
,
occupy
some
little
time
.
<EOS>
from
begin
to
end
,
she
never
look
round
at
me
,
and
she
never
utter
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
I
keep
my
temper
.
<EOS>
My
whole
future
depend
,
in
all
probability
,
on
my
not
lose
possession
of
myself
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
the
time
have
come
to
put
Mr.
Bruff
's
theory
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
in
the
breathless
interest
of
try
that
experiment
,
I
move
round
so
as
to
place
myself
in
front
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
question
to
ask
you
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
oblige
me
to
refer
again
to
a
painful
subject
.
<EOS>
do
Rosanna
Spearman
show
you
the
nightgown
.
<EOS>
yes
,
or
no
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
start
to
her
foot
;
and
walk
close
up
to
me
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
look
me
searchingly
in
the
face
,
as
if
to
read
something
there
which
they
have
never
read
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
mad
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
I
still
restrain
myself
.
<EOS>
I
say
quietly
,
"
Rachel
,
will
you
answer
my
question
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
go
on
,
without
heed
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
some
object
to
gain
which
I
do
not
understand
?
<EOS>
some
mean
fear
about
the
future
,
in
which
I
be
concern
?
<EOS>
They
say
your
father
's
death
have
make
you
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
have
you
come
here
to
compensate
me
for
the
loss
of
my
Diamond
?
<EOS>
and
have
you
heart
enough
leave
to
feel
ashamed
of
your
errand
?
<EOS>
be
that
the
secret
of
your
pretence
of
innocence
,
and
your
story
about
Rosanna
Spearman
?
<EOS>
be
there
a
motive
of
shame
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
falsehood
,
this
time
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
stop
her
there
.
<EOS>
I
could
control
myself
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
do
me
an
infamous
wrong
!
<EOS>
"
I
break
out
hotly
.
<EOS>
"
You
suspect
me
of
steal
your
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
right
to
know
,
and
I
WILL
know
,
the
reason
why
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
suspect
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
her
anger
rise
with
mine
.
"
<EOS>
you
VILLAIN
<EOS>
,
I
saw
you
take
the
diamond
with
my
own
EYES
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
revelation
which
burst
upon
me
in
those
word
,
the
overthrow
which
they
instantly
accomplish
of
the
whole
view
of
the
case
on
which
Mr.
Bruff
have
rely
,
strike
me
helpless
.
<EOS>
innocent
as
I
be
,
I
stand
before
her
in
silence
.
<EOS>
to
her
eye
,
to
any
eye
,
I
must
have
look
like
a
man
overwhelm
by
the
discovery
of
his
own
guilt
.
  
<EOS>
She
draw
back
from
the
spectacle
of
my
humiliation
and
of
her
triumph
.
<EOS>
the
sudden
silence
that
have
fall
upon
me
seem
to
frighten
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
spare
you
,
at
the
time
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
spare
you
now
,
if
you
have
not
force
me
to
speak
.
"
<EOS>
She
move
away
as
if
to
leave
the
room
 
and
hesitate
before
she
get
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
come
here
to
humiliate
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
come
here
to
humiliate
me
?
"
<EOS>
She
go
on
a
few
step
,
and
pause
once
more
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
say
something
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
any
mercy
leave
,
do
not
let
me
degrade
myself
in
this
way
!
<EOS>
say
something
 
and
drive
me
out
of
the
room
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
advance
towards
her
,
hardly
conscious
of
what
I
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
possibly
some
confused
idea
of
detain
her
until
she
have
tell
me
more
.
<EOS>
from
the
moment
when
I
know
that
the
evidence
on
which
I
stand
condemn
in
Rachel
's
mind
,
be
the
evidence
of
her
own
eye
,
nothing
 
not
even
my
conviction
of
my
own
innocence
 
be
clear
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
take
her
by
the
hand
;
I
try
to
speak
firmly
and
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
all
I
could
say
be
,
"
Rachel
,
you
once
love
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
shudder
,
and
look
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
lie
powerless
and
tremble
in
mine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
go
of
it
,
"
she
say
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
My
touch
seem
to
have
the
same
effect
on
her
which
the
sound
of
my
voice
have
produce
when
I
first
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
after
she
have
say
the
word
which
call
me
a
coward
,
after
she
have
make
the
avowal
which
brand
me
as
a
thief
 
while
her
hand
lie
in
mine
<EOS>
I
be
her
master
still
!
  
<EOS>
I
draw
her
gently
back
into
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
seat
her
by
the
side
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rachel
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
can
not
explain
the
contradiction
in
what
I
be
go
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
speak
the
truth
as
you
have
speak
it
.
<EOS>
You
see
me
 
with
your
own
eye
,
you
see
me
take
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
before
God
who
hear
us
,
I
declare
that
I
now
know
I
take
it
for
the
first
time
!
<EOS>
do
you
doubt
me
still
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
neither
heed
nor
hear
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
go
of
my
hand
,
"
she
repeat
faintly
.
<EOS>
that
be
her
only
answer
.
<EOS>
Her
head
sink
on
my
shoulder
;
and
her
hand
unconsciously
close
on
mine
,
at
the
moment
when
she
ask
me
to
release
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
refrain
from
press
the
question
.
<EOS>
but
there
my
forbearance
stop
.
<EOS>
My
chance
of
ever
hold
up
my
head
again
among
honest
man
depend
on
my
chance
of
induce
her
to
make
her
disclosure
complete
.
<EOS>
the
one
hope
leave
for
me
be
the
hope
that
she
may
have
overlook
something
in
the
chain
of
evidence
 
some
mere
trifle
,
perhaps
,
which
may
nevertheless
,
under
careful
investigation
,
be
make
the
mean
of
vindicate
my
innocence
in
the
end

up
my

mercy

HER
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
can
honestly
say
it
 
in
mercy
to
HER

I
turn
away
without
a
word

open
the
door

I
have
enter
the

She
follow
,
and
snatch
the
door
out

she
close
it
,
and
point
back
to
the
place

I
have
leave

no

"
not

It
seem
that
I
owe
a
justification
of
my
conduct
to
you

<EOS>
You
shall
stay
and
hear
it
.
<EOS>
or
you
shall
stoop
to
the
low
infamy
of
all
,
and
force
your
way
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
wring
my
heart
to
see
her
;
it
wring
my
heart
to
hear
her
.
<EOS>
I
answer
by
a
sign
 
it
be
all
I
could
do
 
that
I
submit
myself
to
her
will
.
  
<EOS>
the
crimson
flush
of
anger
begin
to
fade
out
of
her
face
,
as
I
go
back
,
and
take
my
chair
in
silence
.
<EOS>
She
wait
a
little
,
and
steady
herself
.
<EOS>
when
she
go
on
,
but
one
sign
of
feeling
be
discernible
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
speak
without
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
be
fast
clasped
in
her
lap
,
and
her
eye
be
fix
on
the
ground

<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
have
do
you
the
common
justice
to
explain
myself

she

,
repeat
my
own
word

<EOS>
"
You
shall
see
whether
I
do
try
to
do
you
justice

or
not

<EOS>
I
tell
you
just
now
that
I
never
sleep
,
and
never
return
to
my
bed
,
after
you
have
leave
my
sitting

room

<EOS>
It
be
useless
to
trouble
you
by

on
what
I
think
 
<EOS>
you
would
not
understand
my
thought
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
tell
you
what
I
do
,
when
time
enough
have
pass
to
help
me
to
recover
myself

<EOS>
I
refrain
from
alarm
the
house
,

tell
everybody
what
have
happen
 
as
I
ought
to
have
do

<EOS>
in

of
what
I
have
see

I
be
fond
enough
of
you

believe
 
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
any
impossibility
,
rather
than
admit
it
to
my
own
mind
that
you
be
deliberately
a
thief

<EOS>
I
think

think
 
<EOS>

I
end

hear
why

My
letter
would
have
tell
you
nothing
openly

<EOS>
It
would
not
have
ruin
you
for
life
,
if
it
have
fall
into
some
other
person
's
hand
.
<EOS>
It
would
only
have
say
 
in
a
manner
which
you
yourself
could
not
possibly
have
mistake
 
that
I
have
reason
to
know
you
be
in
debt
,
and
that
it
be
in
my
experience
and
in
my
mother
's
experience
of
you
,
that
you
be
not
very
discreet
,

very
scrupulous
about
how
you
get
money
when
you
want
it
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
remember
the
visit
of
the
french
lawyer
,

you
would
have
know
what
I
refer
to

<EOS>
if
you
have
read
on
with
some
interest
after
that
,
you
would
have
come
to
an
offer
I
have
to
make
to
you

the
offer

privately
(
not

openly
about

of
the
loan

large

rise
again

her
eye
look
up
at
me
once
more

You

remind
me
again
that
you

can
tell
you
why

I
tear
it
up

I
ask

<EOS>
"
for
the

it
up

throw
it
away

you

be
the
first
news
that
reach
me
in
the
morning

just
as
my
little
plan

complete

what
do
I
hear
?

I
hear
that
you
 
you

!
!

be
the
foremost
person

house

fetch
the
police

You
be
the
active
man
;
you
be
the
leader
;
you
be
work
harder
than
any
of
them
to
recover
the
jewel
!
<EOS>
You
even
carry
your
audacity
far
enough
to
ask
to
speak
to
me
about
the
loss
of
the
Diamond
 
the
Diamond
which
you
yourself
have
steal
;
the
Diamond
which
be
all
the
time
in
your
own
hand

after
that
proof
of
your
horrible
falseness

cunning
,
I
tear
up
my
letter

even
then
 
even
when
I
be
madden
by
the
search
and
questioning
of
the
policeman
,
whom
you
have
send
in
 
even
then
,
there
be
some
infatuation
in
my
mind

would
not
let
me
give
you
up

I
say
to
myself
,
"
He

play
his

farce

go
down

<EOS>
I
may
have
answer
that
I
remember
every

it

what
purpose
,
at
that
moment

would
the
answer
have
serve
?

how
could
I
tell
her
that
what
she

astonish
me

have
distress
me
,
have
suggest
to
me
that
she
be
in
a
state
of
dangerous
nervous
excitement

have
even
rouse
a
moment
's
doubt
in
my

whether
the
loss
of
the
jewel
be
as
much
a
mystery
to
her
as
to
the
rest

us

have
never

give
me
so
much
as
a
glimpse
at
the
truth

<EOS>
without
the
shadow
of
a
proof
to
produce
in
vindication
of
my
innocence

how
could
I
persuade
her
that
I
know
no
more

the

stranger
could
have
know
of
what
be
really
in
her
thought

if
I

the

I

You

Rachel

I
have
come
here
after
take
her
back
to
Portland
Place
;
it
be
impossible
to
let
her
return
in
the
carriage
by
herself

<EOS>
I
can
hardly
hold
you
responsible
 
<EOS>
consider
that
you
see
her
in
my
house
and
by
my
permission
 
for
the
shock
that
this
unlucky
interview
have
inflict
on
her
.
<EOS>
all
I
can
do
be
to
provide
against
a
repetition
of
the
mischief

<EOS>
She
be
young
 
<EOS>
she
have
a
resolute
spirit
 
<EOS>
she
will
get
over
this
,
with
time
and
rest
to
help
her
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
assure
that
you
will
do
nothing
to
hinder
her
recovery
.
<EOS>
May
I
depend
on
your
make
no
second

see
her
 
except
with
my
sanction
and
approval

"
  
<EOS>
"
after
what
she
have
suffer

and
after
what
I
have
suffer

I

,
"
you
may
rely

"
I

"
You
have
my

<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
look
relieved
.
<EOS>
He
put
down
his
hat
,
and
draw
his
chair
nearer
to
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
settle
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
now
,
about
the
future
 
<EOS>
your
future

I
mean
.
<EOS>
to
my
mind
,
the
result
of
the
extraordinary
turn
which
the
matter
have
now
take
be
briefly
this
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
we
be
sure
that
Rachel
have
tell
you
the
whole
truth
,
as
plainly
as
word
can
tell
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
second
place
 
though
we
know
that
there
must
be
some
dreadful
mistake
somewhere
 
we
can
hardly
blame
her
for
believe
you
to
be
guilty
,
on
the
evidence
of
her
own
sense
;
back
,
as
that
evidence
have
be
,
by
circumstance
which
appear
,
on
the
face
of
them
,
to
tell
dead
against
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
I
interpose
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
blame
Rachel
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
regret
that
she
could
not
prevail
on
herself
to
speak
more
plainly
to
me
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
as
well
regret
that
Rachel
be
not
somebody
else
,
"
rejoin
Mr.
Bruff
.
"
<EOS>
and
even
then
,
I
doubt
if
a
girl
of
any
delicacy
,
whose
heart
have
be
set
on
marry
you
,
could
have
bring
herself
to
charge
you
to
your
face
with
be
a
thief
.
<EOS>
anyhow
,
it
be
not
in
Rachel
's
nature
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
in
a
very
different
matter
to
this
matter
of
yours
 
which
place
her
,
however
,
in
a
position
not
altogether
unlike
her
position
towards
you
 
<EOS>
I
happen
to
know
that
she
be
influence
by
a
similar
motive
to
the
motive
which
actuate
her
conduct
in
your
case
.
<EOS>
besides
,
as
she
tell
me
herself
,
on
our
way
to
town
this
evening
,
if
she
have
speak
plainly
,
she
would
no
more
have
believe
your
denial
then
than
she
believe
it
now
.
<EOS>
what
answer
can
you
make
to
that
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
answer
to
be
make
to
it
.
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
Mr.
Franklin
!
<EOS>
my
view
of
the
case
have
be
prove
to
be
all
wrong
,
I
admit
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
thing
be
now
,
my
advice
may
be
worth
have
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
plainly
,
we
shall
be
waste
our
time
,
and
cudgel
our
brain
to
no
purpose
,
if
we
attempt
to
try
back
,
and
unravel
this
frightful
complication
from
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
let
us
close
our
mind
resolutely
to
all
that
happen
last
year
at
Lady
Verinder
's
country
house
;
and
let
us
look
to
what
we
CAN
discover
in
the
future
,
instead
of
to
what
we
can
not
discover
in
the
past
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
surely
you
forget
,
"
I
say
,
"
that
the
whole
thing
be
essentially
a
matter
of
the
past
 
so
far
as
I
be
concerned
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
answer
me
this
,
"
retort
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
be
the
moonstone
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
mischief
 
or
be
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
good
.
<EOS>
what
do
we
believe
be
do
with
the
Moonstone
,
when
it
be
take
to
London
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
pledge
to
Mr.
Luker
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
know
that
you
be
not
the
person

we

who
do
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
do
we
believe
the
moonstone
to
be
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
deposit
in
the
keeping
of
Mr.
Luker
's
banker
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
exactly
.
<EOS>
now
observe
.
<EOS>
We
be
already
in
the
month
of
June
.
<EOS>
towards
the
end
of
the
month
(
I
can
not
be
particular
to
a
day
)
<EOS>
a
year
will
have
elapse
from
the
time
when
we
believe
the
jewel
to
have
be
pledge
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
chance
 
to
say
the
least
 
that
the
person
who
pawn
it
,
may
be
prepare
to
redeem
it
when
the
year
's
time
have
expire
.
<EOS>
if
he
redeem
it
,
Mr.
Luker
must
himself
 
<EOS>
accord
to
the
term
of
his
own
arrangement
 
take
the
Diamond
out
of
his
banker
's
hand
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
I
propose
set
a
watch
at
the
bank
,
as
the
present
month
draw
to
an
end
,
and
discover
who
the
person
be
to
whom
Mr.
Luker
restore
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
do
you
see
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
admit
(
a
little
unwillingly
)
that
the
idea
be
a
new
one
,
at
any
rate
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
Mr.
Murthwaite
's
idea
quite
as
much
as
mine
,
"
say
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
have
never
enter
my
head
,
but
for
a
conversation
we
have
together
some
time
since
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Murthwaite
be
right
,
the
Indians
be
likely
to
be
on
the
lookout
at
the
bank
,
towards
the
end
of
the
month
too
 
and
something
serious
may
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
what
come
of
it
do
not
matter
to
you
and
me
except
as
it
may
help
us
to
lay
our
hand
on
the
mysterious
Somebody
who
pawn
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
that
person
,
you
may
rely
on
it
,
be
responsible
<EOS>
(
I
do
not
pretend
to
know
how
)
for
the
position
in
which
you
stand
at
this
moment
;
and
that
person
alone
can
set
you
right
in
Rachel
's
estimation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
deny
,
"
I
say
,
"
that
the
plan
you
propose
meet
the
difficulty
in
a
way
that
be
very
daring
,
and
very
ingenious
,
and
very
new
.
<EOS>
but
 
"
  
"
but
you
have
an
objection
to
make
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
My
objection
be
,
that
your
proposal
oblige
us
to
wait
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
grant
.
<EOS>
as
I
reckon
the
time
,
it
require
you
to
wait
about
a
fortnight
 
more
or
less
.
<EOS>
be
that
so
very
long
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
life
-
time
,
Mr.
Bruff
,
in
such
a
situation
as
mine
.
<EOS>
My
existence
will
be
simply
unendurable
to
me
,
unless
I
do
something
towards
clear
my
character
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
I
understand
that
.
<EOS>
have
you
think
yet
of
what
you
can
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
of
consult
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
retire
from
the
police
.
<EOS>
It
be
useless
to
expect
the
Sergeant
to
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
where
to
find
him
;
and
I
can
but
try
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
try
,
"
say
Mr.
Bruff
,
after
a
moment
's
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
the
case
have
assume
such
an
extraordinary
aspect
since
Sergeant
Cuff
's
time
,
that
you
may
revive
his
interest
in
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
try
,
and
let
me
hear
the
result
.
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
,
"
he
continue
,
rise
,
"
if
you
make
no
discovery
between
this
,
and
the
end
of
the
month
,
be
I
free
to
try
,
on
my
side
,
what
can
be
do
by
keep
a
lookout
at
the
bank
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
I
answer
 
"
unless
I
relieve
you
of
all
necessity
for
try
the
experiment
in
the
interval
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
smile
,
and
take
up
his
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
he
rejoin
,
"
that
I
say
the
discovery
of
the
truth
depend
on
the
discovery
of
the
person
who
pawn
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
and
let
me
hear
what
the
Sergeant
's
experience
say
to
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
we
part
.
  
<EOS>
early
the
next
morning
,
I
set
forth
for
the
little
town
of
Dorking
 
the
place
of
Sergeant
Cuff
's
retirement
,
as
indicate
to
me
by
Betteredge
.
  
<EOS>
inquire
at
the
hotel
,
I
receive
the
necessary
direction
for
find
the
Sergeant
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
It
be
approach
by
a
quiet
bye
-
road
,
a
little
way
out
of
the
town
,
and
it
stand
snugly
in
the
middle
of
its
own
plot
of
garden
ground
,
protect
by
a
good
brick
wall
at
the
back
and
the
side
,
and
by
a
high
quickset
hedge
in
front
.
<EOS>
the
gate
,
ornament
at
the
upper
part
by
smartly
-
paint
trellis
-
work
,
be
lock
.
<EOS>
after
ring
at
the
bell
,
I
peer
through
the
trellis
-
work
,
and
see
the
great
Cuff
's
favourite
flower
everywhere
;
bloom
in
his
garden
,
cluster
over
his
door
,
look
in
at
his
window
.
<EOS>
far
from
the
crime
and
the
mystery
of
the
great
city
,
the
illustrious
thief
-
taker
be
placidly
live
out
the
last
Sybarite
year
of
his
life
,
smother
in
rose
!
  
<EOS>
a
decent
elderly
woman
open
the
gate
to
me
,
and
at
once
annihilate
all
the
hope
I
have
build
on
secure
the
assistance
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
He
have
start
,
only
the
day
before
,
on
a
journey
to
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
he
go
there
on
business
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
have
only
one
business
now
,
sir
,
"
she
say
;
"
and
that
be
rose
.
<EOS>
some
great
man
's
gardener
in
Ireland
have
find
out
something
new
in
the
growing
of
rose
 
and
<EOS>
Mr.
Cuff
be
away
to
inquire
into
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
when
he
will
be
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
uncertain
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cuff
say
he
should
come
back
directly
,
or
be
away
some
time
,
just
accord
as
he
find
the
new
discovery
worth
nothing
,
or
worth
look
into
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
any
message
to
leave
for
him
,
I
will
take
care
,
sir
,
that
he
get
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
give
her
my
card
,
have
first
write
on
it
in
pencil
:
"
I
have
something
to
say
about
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
let
me
hear
from
you
as
soon
as
you
get
back
.
<EOS>
"
that
do
,
there
be
nothing
leave
but
to
submit
to
circumstance
,
and
return
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
irritable
condition
of
my
mind
,
at
the
time
of
which
I
be
now
write
,
the
abortive
result
of
my
journey
to
the
Sergeant
's
cottage
simply
aggravate
the
restless
impulse
in
me
to
be
do
something
.
<EOS>
on
the
day
of
my
return
from
Dorking
,
I
determine
that
the
next
morning
should
find
me
bent
on
a
new
effort
at
force
my
way
,
through
all
obstacle
,
from
the
darkness
to
the
light
.
  
<EOS>
what
form
be
my
next
experiment
to
take
?
  
<EOS>
if
the
excellent
Betteredge
have
be
present
while
I
be
consider
that
question
,
and
if
he
have
be
let
into
the
secret
of
my
thought
,
he
would
,
no
doubt
,
have
declare
that
the
german
side
of
me
be
,
on
this
occasion
,
my
uppermost
side
.
<EOS>
to
speak
seriously
,
it
be
perhaps
possible
that
my
german
training
be
in
some
degree
responsible
for
the
labyrinth
of
useless
speculation
in
which
I
now
involve
myself
.
<EOS>
for
the
great
part
of
the
night
,
I
sit
smoke
,
and
build
up
theory
,
one
more
profoundly
improbable
than
another
.
<EOS>
when
I
do
get
to
sleep
,
my
waking
fancy
pursue
me
in
dream
.
<EOS>
I
rise
the
next
morning
,
with
Objective
-
subjective
and
Subjective
-
objective
inextricably
entangle
together
in
my
mind
;
and
I
begin
the
day
which
be
to
witness
my
next
effort
at
practical
action
of
some
kind
,
by
doubt
whether
I
have
any
sort
of
right
(
on
purely
philosophical
ground
)
to
consider
any
sort
of
thing
(
the
Diamond
include
)
as
exist
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
how
long
I
may
have
remain
lose
in
the
mist
of
my
own
metaphysic
,
if
I
have
be
leave
to
extricate
myself
,
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
say
.
<EOS>
as
the
event
prove
,
accident
come
to
my
rescue
,
and
happily
deliver
me
.
<EOS>
I
happen
to
wear
,
that
morning
,
the
same
coat
which
I
have
wear
on
the
day
of
my
interview
with
Rachel
.
<EOS>
search
for
something
else
in
one
of
the
pocket
,
I
come
upon
a
crumpled
piece
of
paper
,
and
,
take
it
out
,
find
Betteredge
's
forget
letter
in
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
hard
on
my
good
old
friend
to
leave
him
without
a
reply
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
my
writing
-
table
,
and
read
his
letter
again
.
  
<EOS>
a
letter
which
have
nothing
of
the
slight
importance
in
it
,
be
not
always
an
easy
letter
to
answer
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
's
present
effort
at
correspond
with
me
come
within
this
category
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
's
assistant
,
otherwise
Ezra
Jennings
,
have
tell
his
master
that
he
have
see
me
;
and
Mr.
Candy
,
in
his
turn
,
want
to
see
me
and
say
something
to
me
,
when
I
be
next
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Frizinghall
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
say
in
answer
to
that
,
which
would
be
worth
the
paper
it
be
write
on
?
<EOS>
I
sit
idly
draw
likeness
from
memory
of
Mr.
Candy
's
remarkable
-
look
assistant
,
on
the
sheet
of
paper
which
I
have
vow
to
dedicate
to
Betteredge
 
until
it
suddenly
occur
to
me
that
here
be
the
irrepressible
Ezra
Jennings
get
in
my
way
again
!
<EOS>
I
throw
a
dozen
portrait
,
at
least
,
of
the
man
with
the
piebald
hair
(
the
hair
in
every
case
,
remarkably
like
)
,
into
the
waste
-
paper
basket
 
<EOS>
and
then
and
there
,
write
my
answer
to
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
perfectly
commonplace
letter
 
<EOS>
but
it
have
one
excellent
effect
on
me
.
<EOS>
the
effort
of
write
a
few
sentence
,
in
plain
English
,
completely
clear
my
mind
of
the
cloudy
nonsense
which
have
fill
it
since
the
previous
day
.
  
<EOS>
devote
myself
once
more
to
the
elucidation
of
the
impenetrable
puzzle
which
my
own
position
present
to
me
,
I
now
try
to
meet
the
difficulty
by
investigate
it
from
a
plainly
practical
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
the
event
of
the
memorable
night
be
still
unintelligible
to
me
,
I
look
a
little
farther
back
,
and
search
my
memory
of
the
early
hour
of
the
birthday
for
any
incident
which
may
prove
of
some
assistance
to
me
in
find
the
clue
.
  
<EOS>
have
anything
happen
while
Rachel
and
I
be
finish
the
paint
door
?
<EOS>
or
,
later
,
when
I
ride
over
to
Frizinghall
?
<EOS>
or
afterwards
,
when
I
go
back
with
Godfrey
Ablewhite
and
his
sister
?
<EOS>
or
,
later
again
,
when
I
put
the
Moonstone
into
Rachel
's
hand
?
<EOS>
or
,
later
still
,
when
the
company
come
,
and
we
all
assemble
round
the
dinner
-
table
?
<EOS>
My
memory
dispose
of
that
string
of
question
readily
enough
,
until
I
come
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
look
back
at
the
social
event
of
the
birthday
dinner
,
I
find
myself
bring
to
a
standstill
at
the
outset
of
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
even
capable
of
accurately
remember
the
number
of
the
guest
who
have
sit
at
the
same
table
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
to
feel
myself
completely
at
fault
here
,
and
to
conclude
,
thereupon
,
that
the
incident
of
the
dinner
may
especially
repay
the
trouble
of
investigate
them
,
form
part
of
the
same
mental
process
,
in
my
case
.
<EOS>
I
believe
other
people
,
in
a
similar
situation
,
would
have
reason
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
when
the
pursuit
of
our
own
interest
cause
us
to
become
object
of
inquiry
to
ourselves
,
we
be
naturally
suspicious
of
what
we
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
once
in
possession
of
the
name
of
the
person
who
have
be
present
at
the
dinner
,
I
resolve
 
as
a
means
of
enrich
the
deficient
resource
of
my
own
memory
 
to
appeal
to
the
memory
of
the
rest
of
the
guest
;
to
write
down
all
that
they
could
recollect
of
the
social
event
of
the
birthday
;
and
to
test
the
result
,
thus
obtain
,
by
the
light
of
what
have
happen
afterwards
,
when
the
company
have
leave
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
this
last
and
new
of
my
many
contemplate
experiment
in
the
art
of
inquiry
 
<EOS>
which
Betteredge
would
probably
have
attribute
to
the
clear
-
headed
,
or
French
,
side
of
me
be
uppermost
for
the
moment
 
may
fairly
claim
record
here
,
on
its
own
merit
.
<EOS>
unlikely
as
it
may
seem
,
I
have
now
actually
grope
my
way
to
the
root
of
the
matter
at
last
.
<EOS>
all
I
want
be
a
hint
to
guide
me
in
the
right
direction
at
start
.
<EOS>
before
another
day
have
pass
over
my
head
,
that
hint
be
give
me
by
one
of
the
company
who
have
be
present
at
the
birthday
feast
!
  
<EOS>
with
the
plan
of
proceeding
which
I
now
have
in
view
,
it
be
first
necessary
to
possess
the
complete
list
of
the
guest
.
<EOS>
this
I
could
easily
obtain
from
Gabriel
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
I
determine
to
go
back
to
Yorkshire
on
that
day
,
and
to
begin
my
contemplate
investigation
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
just
too
late
to
start
by
the
train
which
leave
London
before
noon
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
alternative
but
to
wait
,
nearly
three
hour
,
for
the
departure
of
the
next
train
.
<EOS>
be
there
anything
I
could
do
in
London
,
which
may
usefully
occupy
this
interval
of
time
?
  
<EOS>
My
thought
go
back
again
obstinately
to
the
birthday
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
though
I
have
forget
the
number
,
and
,
in
many
case
,
the
name
of
the
guest
,
I
remember
readily
enough
that
by
far
the
large
proportion
of
them
come
from
Frizinghall
,
or
from
its
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
but
the
large
proportion
be
not
all
.
<EOS>
some
few
of
us
be
not
regular
resident
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
myself
be
one
of
the
few
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Murthwaite
be
another
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
Ablewhite
be
a
third
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
 
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
:
I
call
to
mind
that
business
have
prevent
Mr.
Bruff
from
make
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
have
any
lady
be
present
,
whose
usual
residence
be
in
London
?
<EOS>
I
could
only
remember
Miss
Clack
as
come
within
this
latter
category
.
<EOS>
however
,
here
be
three
of
the
guest
,
at
any
rate
,
whom
it
be
clearly
advisable
for
me
to
see
before
I
leave
town
.
<EOS>
I
drive
off
at
once
to
Mr.
Bruff
's
office
;
not
know
the
address
of
the
person
of
whom
I
be
in
search
,
and
think
it
probable
that
he
may
put
me
in
the
way
of
find
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
prove
to
be
too
busy
to
give
me
more
than
a
minute
of
his
valuable
time
.
<EOS>
in
that
minute
,
however
,
he
contrive
to
dispose
 
in
the
most
discouraging
manner
 
of
all
the
question
I
have
to
put
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
consider
my
newly
-
discover
method
of
find
a
clue
to
the
mystery
as
something
too
purely
fanciful
to
be
seriously
discuss
.
<EOS>
in
the
second
,
third
,
and
fourth
place
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
be
now
on
his
way
back
to
the
scene
of
his
past
adventure
;
Miss
Clack
have
suffer
loss
,
and
have
settle
,
from
motive
of
economy
,
in
France
;
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
may
,
or
may
not
,
be
discoverable
somewhere
in
London
.
<EOS>
suppose
I
inquire
at
his
club
?
<EOS>
and
suppose
I
excuse
Mr.
Bruff
,
if
he
go
back
to
his
business
and
wish
me
good
morning
?
  
<EOS>
the
field
of
inquiry
in
London
,
be
now
so
narrowed
as
only
to
include
the
one
necessity
of
discover
Godfrey
's
address
,
I
take
the
lawyer
's
hint
,
and
drive
to
his
club
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
hall
,
I
meet
with
one
of
the
member
,
who
be
an
old
friend
of
my
cousin
's
,
and
who
be
also
an
acquaintance
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
after
enlighten
me
on
the
subject
of
Godfrey
's
address
,
tell
me
of
two
recent
event
in
his
life
,
which
be
of
some
importance
in
themselves
,
and
which
have
not
previously
reach
my
ear
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
that
Godfrey
,
far
from
be
discourage
by
Rachel
's
withdrawal
from
her
engagement
to
him
have
make
matrimonial
advance
soon
afterwards
to
another
young
lady
,
repute
to
be
a
great
heiress
.
<EOS>
His
suit
have
prosper
,
and
his
marriage
have
be
consider
as
a
settle
and
certain
thing
.
<EOS>
but
,
here
again
,
the
engagement
have
be
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
break
off
 
owing
,
it
be
say
,
on
this
occasion
,
to
a
serious
difference
of
opinion
between
the
bridegroom
and
the
lady
's
father
,
on
the
question
of
settlement
.
  
<EOS>
as
some
compensation
for
this
second
matrimonial
disaster
,
Godfrey
have
soon
afterwards
find
himself
the
object
of
fond
pecuniary
remembrance
,
on
the
part
of
one
of
his
many
admirer
.
<EOS>
a
rich
old
lady
 
highly
respect
at
the
Mothers
'
Small
-
Clothes
-
Conversion
-
Society
,
and
a
great
friend
of
Miss
Clack
's
(
to
whom
she
leave
nothing
but
a
mourning
ring
)
 
have
bequeath
to
the
admirable
and
meritorious
Godfrey
a
legacy
of
five
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
after
receive
this
handsome
addition
to
his
own
modest
pecuniary
resource
,
he
have
be
hear
to
say
that
he
feel
the
necessity
of
get
a
little
respite
from
his
charitable
labour
,
and
that
his
doctor
prescribe
"
a
run
on
the
Continent
,
as
likely
to
be
productive
of
much
future
benefit
to
his
health
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
want
to
see
him
,
it
would
be
advisable
to
lose
no
time
in
pay
my
contemplate
visit
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
,
then
and
there
,
to
pay
my
visit
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
fatality
which
have
make
me
just
one
day
too
late
in
call
on
Sergeant
Cuff
,
make
me
again
one
day
too
late
in
call
on
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
He
have
leave
London
,
on
the
previous
morning
,
by
the
tidal
train
,
for
Dover
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
cross
to
Ostend
;
and
his
servant
believe
he
be
go
on
to
Brussels
.
<EOS>
the
time
of
his
return
be
rather
uncertain
;
but
I
may
be
sure
he
would
be
away
at
least
three
month
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
back
to
my
lodging
a
little
depressed
in
spirit
.
<EOS>
three
of
the
guest
at
the
birthday
dinner
 
and
those
three
<EOS>
all
exceptionally
intelligent
people
 
be
out
of
my
reach
,
at
the
very
time
when
it
be
most
important
to
be
able
to
communicate
with
them
.
<EOS>
My
last
hope
now
rest
on
Betteredge
,
and
on
the
friend
of
the
late
Lady
Verinder
whom
I
may
still
find
live
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Rachel
's
country
house
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
I
travel
straight
to
Frizinghall
 
<EOS>
the
town
be
now
the
central
point
in
my
field
of
inquiry
.
<EOS>
I
arrive
too
late
in
the
evening
to
be
able
to
communicate
with
Betteredge
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
I
send
a
messenger
with
a
letter
,
request
him
to
join
me
at
the
hotel
,
at
his
early
convenience
.
  
<EOS>
have
take
the
precaution
 
partly
to
save
time
,
partly
to
accommodate
Betteredge
 
of
send
my
messenger
in
a
fly
,
I
have
a
reasonable
prospect
,
if
no
delay
occur
,
of
see
the
old
man
within
less
than
two
hour
from
the
time
when
I
have
send
for
him
.
<EOS>
during
this
interval
,
I
arrange
to
employ
myself
in
open
my
contemplate
inquiry
,
among
the
guest
present
at
the
birthday
dinner
who
be
personally
know
to
me
,
and
who
be
easily
within
my
reach
.
<EOS>
these
be
my
relative
,
the
Ablewhites
,
and
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
express
a
special
wish
to
see
me
,
and
the
doctor
live
in
the
next
street
.
<EOS>
so
to
Mr.
Candy
I
go
first
.
  
<EOS>
after
what
Betteredge
have
tell
me
,
I
naturally
anticipate
finding
trace
in
the
doctor
's
face
of
the
severe
illness
from
which
he
have
suffer
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
utterly
unprepared
for
such
a
change
as
I
see
in
him
when
he
enter
the
room
and
shake
hand
with
me
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
dim
;
his
hair
have
turn
completely
grey
;
his
face
be
wizen
;
his
figure
have
shrink
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
once
lively
,
rattlepate
,
humorous
little
doctor
 
associate
in
my
remembrance
with
the
perpetration
of
incorrigible
social
indiscretion
and
innumerable
boyish
joke
 
<EOS>
and
I
see
nothing
leave
of
his
former
self
,
but
the
old
tendency
to
vulgar
smartness
in
his
dress
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
a
wreck
;
but
his
clothe
and
his
jewellery
 
in
cruel
mockery
of
the
change
in
him
 
be
as
gay
and
as
gaudy
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
think
of
you
,
Mr.
Blake
,
"
he
say
;
"
and
I
be
heartily
glad
to
see
you
again
at
last
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
anything
I
can
do
for
you
,
pray
command
my
service
,
sir
 
pray
command
my
service
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
say
those
few
commonplace
word
with
needless
hurry
and
eagerness
,
and
with
a
curiosity
to
know
what
have
bring
me
to
Yorkshire
,
which
he
be
perfectly
 
I
may
say
childishly
 
incapable
of
conceal
from
notice
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
object
that
I
have
in
view
,
I
have
of
course
foresee
the
necessity
of
enter
into
some
sort
of
personal
explanation
,
before
I
could
hope
to
interest
people
,
mostly
stranger
to
me
,
in
do
their
good
to
assist
my
inquiry
.
<EOS>
on
the
journey
to
Frizinghall
I
have
arrange
what
my
explanation
be
to
be
 
<EOS>
and
I
seize
the
opportunity
now
offer
to
me
of
try
the
effect
of
it
on
Mr.
Candy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
Yorkshire
,
the
other
day
,
and
I
be
in
Yorkshire
again
now
,
on
rather
a
romantic
errand
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
matter
,
Mr.
Candy
,
in
which
the
late
Lady
Verinder
's
friend
all
take
some
interest
.
<EOS>
You
remember
the
mysterious
loss
of
the
Indian
Diamond
,
now
nearly
a
year
since
?
<EOS>
circumstance
have
lately
happen
which
lead
to
the
hope
that
it
may
yet
be
find
 
and
I
be
interesting
myself
,
as
one
of
the
family
,
in
recover
it
.
<EOS>
among
the
obstacle
in
my
way
,
there
be
the
necessity
of
collect
again
all
the
evidence
which
be
discover
at
the
time
,
and
more
if
possible
.
<EOS>
there
be
peculiarity
in
this
case
which
make
it
desirable
to
revive
my
recollection
of
everything
that
happen
in
the
house
,
on
the
evening
of
Miss
Verinder
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
and
I
venture
to
appeal
to
her
late
mother
's
friend
who
be
present
on
that
occasion
,
to
lend
me
the
assistance
of
their
memory
 
<EOS>
"
  
I
have
get
as
far
as
that
in
rehearse
my
explanatory
phrase
,
when
I
be
suddenly
check
by
see
plainly
in
Mr.
Candy
's
face
that
my
experiment
on
him
be
a
total
failure
.
  
<EOS>
the
little
doctor
sit
restlessly
pick
at
the
point
of
his
finger
all
the
time
I
be
speak
.
<EOS>
His
dim
watery
eye
be
fix
on
my
face
with
an
expression
of
vacant
and
wistful
inquiry
very
painful
to
see
.
<EOS>
what
he
be
think
of
,
it
be
impossible
to
divine
.
<EOS>
the
one
thing
clearly
visible
be
that
I
have
fail
,
after
the
first
two
or
three
word
,
in
fix
his
attention
.
<EOS>
the
only
chance
of
recall
him
to
himself
appear
to
lie
in
change
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
try
a
new
topic
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
much
,
"
I
say
,
gaily
,
"
for
what
bring
me
to
Frizinghall
!
<EOS>
now
,
Mr.
Candy
,
it
be
your
turn
.
<EOS>
You
send
me
a
message
by
Gabriel
Betteredge
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
leave
off
pick
at
his
finger
,
and
suddenly
brighten
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
be
it
!
<EOS>
I
send
you
a
message
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
Betteredge
duly
communicate
it
by
letter
,
"
I
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
something
to
say
to
me
,
the
next
time
I
be
in
your
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
well
,
Mr.
Candy
,
here
I
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
here
you
be
!
"
echo
the
doctor
.
"
<EOS>
and
Betteredge
be
quite
right
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
message
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
be
a
wonderful
man
.
<EOS>
what
a
memory
!
<EOS>
at
his
age
,
what
a
memory
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
drop
back
into
silence
,
and
begin
pick
at
his
finger
again
.
<EOS>
recollect
what
I
have
hear
from
Betteredge
about
the
effect
of
the
fever
on
his
memory
,
I
go
on
with
the
conversation
,
in
the
hope
that
I
may
help
him
at
start
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
long
time
since
we
meet
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
We
last
see
each
other
at
the
last
birthday
dinner
my
poor
aunt
be
ever
to
give
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
it
!
"
cry
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
"
the
birthday
dinner
!
"
<EOS>
He
start
impulsively
to
his
foot
,
and
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
a
deep
flush
suddenly
overspread
his
faded
face
,
and
he
abruptly
sit
down
again
,
as
if
conscious
of
have
betray
a
weakness
which
he
would
fain
have
conceal
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
,
pitiably
plain
,
that
he
be
aware
of
his
own
defect
of
memory
,
and
that
he
be
bent
on
hide
it
from
the
observation
of
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
thus
far
he
have
appeal
to
my
compassion
only
.
<EOS>
but
the
word
he
have
just
say
 
few
as
they
be
 
rouse
my
curiosity
instantly
to
the
high
pitch
.
<EOS>
the
birthday
dinner
have
already
become
the
one
event
in
the
past
,
at
which
I
look
back
with
strangely
-
mixed
feeling
of
hope
and
distrust
.
<EOS>
and
here
be
the
birthday
dinner
unmistakably
proclaim
itself
as
the
subject
on
which
Mr.
Candy
have
something
important
to
say
to
me
!
  
<EOS>
I
attempt
to
help
him
out
once
more
.
<EOS>
but
,
this
time
,
my
own
interest
be
at
the
bottom
of
my
compassionate
motive
,
and
they
hurry
me
on
a
little
too
abruptly
,
to
the
end
I
have
in
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
nearly
a
year
now
,
"
I
say
,
"
since
we
sit
at
that
pleasant
table
.
<EOS>
have
you
make
any
memorandum
 
in
your
diary
,
or
otherwise
 
of
what
you
want
to
say
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Candy
understand
the
suggestion
,
and
show
me
that
he
understand
it
,
as
an
insult
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
require
no
memorandum
,
Mr.
Blake
,
"
he
say
,
stiffly
enough
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
such
a
very
old
man
,
yet
 
and
my
memory
(
thank
God
)
be
to
be
thoroughly
depend
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
needless
to
say
that
I
decline
to
understand
that
he
be
offend
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
say
the
same
of
my
memory
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
try
to
think
of
matter
that
be
a
year
old
,
I
seldom
find
my
remembrance
as
vivid
as
I
could
wish
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
take
the
dinner
at
Lady
Verinder
's
,
for
instance
 
"
  
Mr.
Candy
brighten
up
again
,
the
moment
the
allusion
pass
my
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
the
dinner
,
the
dinner
at
Lady
Verinder
's
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
more
eagerly
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
something
to
say
to
you
about
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
eye
look
at
me
again
with
the
painful
expression
of
inquiry
,
so
wistful
,
so
vacant
,
so
miserably
helpless
to
see
.
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
try
hard
,
and
try
in
vain
,
to
recover
the
lose
recollection
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
very
pleasant
dinner
,
"
he
burst
out
suddenly
,
with
an
air
of
say
exactly
what
he
want
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
a
very
pleasant
dinner
,
Mr.
Blake
,
be
not
it
?
"
<EOS>
He
nod
and
smile
,
and
appear
to
think
,
poor
fellow
,
that
he
have
succeed
in
conceal
the
total
failure
of
his
memory
,
by
a
well
-
time
exertion
of
his
own
presence
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
so
distressing
that
I
at
once
shift
the
talk
 
deeply
as
I
be
interested
in
his
recover
the
lose
remembrance
 
to
topic
of
local
interest
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
he
get
on
glibly
enough
.
<EOS>
trumpery
little
scandal
and
quarrel
in
the
town
,
some
of
them
as
much
as
a
month
old
,
appear
to
recur
to
his
memory
readily
.
<EOS>
He
chatter
on
,
with
something
of
the
smooth
gossiping
fluency
of
former
time
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
moment
,
even
in
the
full
flow
of
his
talkativeness
,
when
he
suddenly
hesitate
 
look
at
me
for
a
moment
with
the
vacant
inquiry
once
more
in
his
eye
 
control
himself
 
and
go
on
again
.
<EOS>
I
submit
patiently
to
my
martyrdom
(
it
be
surely
nothing
less
than
martyrdom
to
a
man
of
cosmopolitan
sympathy
,
to
absorb
in
silent
resignation
the
news
of
a
country
town
?
)
<EOS>
until
the
clock
on
the
chimney
-
piece
tell
me
that
my
visit
have
be
prolong
beyond
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
have
now
some
right
to
consider
the
sacrifice
as
complete
,
I
rise
to
take
leave
.
<EOS>
as
we
shake
hand
,
Mr.
Candy
revert
to
the
birthday
festival
of
his
own
accord
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
we
have
meet
again
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
it
on
my
mind
 
<EOS>
I
really
have
it
on
my
mind
,
Mr.
Blake
,
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
about
the
dinner
at
Lady
Verinder
's
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
a
pleasant
dinner
 
really
a
pleasant
dinner
now
,
be
not
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
on
repeat
the
phrase
,
he
seem
to
feel
hardly
as
certain
of
have
prevent
me
from
suspect
his
lapse
of
memory
,
as
he
have
feel
on
the
first
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
wistful
look
cloud
his
face
again
:
and
,
after
apparently
design
to
accompany
me
to
the
street
door
,
he
suddenly
change
his
mind
,
rang
the
bell
for
the
servant
,
and
remain
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
slowly
down
the
doctor
's
stair
,
feel
the
dishearten
conviction
that
he
really
have
something
to
say
which
it
be
vitally
important
to
me
to
hear
,
and
that
he
be
morally
incapable
of
say
it
.
<EOS>
the
effort
of
remember
that
he
want
to
speak
to
me
be
,
but
too
evidently
,
the
only
effort
that
his
enfeeble
memory
be
now
able
to
achieve
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
I
reach
the
bottom
of
the
stair
,
and
have
turn
a
corner
on
my
way
to
the
outer
hall
,
a
door
open
softly
somewhere
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
house
,
and
a
gentle
voice
say
behind
me
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
sir
,
you
find
Mr.
Candy
sadly
change
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
turn
round
,
and
find
myself
face
to
face
with
Ezra
Jennings
.
    
<EOS>
the
doctor
's
pretty
housemaid
stand
wait
for
me
,
with
the
street
door
open
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
pour
brightly
into
the
hall
,
the
morning
light
fall
full
on
the
face
of
Mr.
Candy
's
assistant
when
I
turn
,
and
look
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
dispute
Betteredge
's
assertion
that
the
appearance
of
Ezra
Jennings
,
speak
from
a
popular
point
of
view
,
be
against
him
.
<EOS>
His
gipsy
-
complexion
,
his
fleshless
cheek
,
his
gaunt
facial
bone
,
his
dreamy
eye
,
his
extraordinary
parti
-
coloured
hair
,
the
puzzle
contradiction
between
his
face
and
figure
which
make
him
look
old
and
young
both
together
 
be
all
more
or
less
calculated
to
produce
an
unfavourable
impression
of
him
on
a
stranger
's
mind
.
<EOS>
and
yet
 
feel
this
as
I
certainly
do
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
to
be
deny
that
Ezra
Jennings
make
some
inscrutable
appeal
to
my
sympathy
,
which
I
find
it
impossible
to
resist
.
<EOS>
while
my
knowledge
of
the
world
warn
me
to
answer
the
question
which
he
have
put
,
acknowledge
that
I
do
indeed
find
Mr.
Candy
sadly
change
,
and
then
to
proceed
on
my
way
out
of
the
house
 
my
interest
in
Ezra
Jennings
hold
me
root
to
the
place
,
and
give
him
the
opportunity
of
speak
to
me
in
private
about
his
employer
,
for
which
he
have
be
evidently
on
the
watch
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
walk
my
way
,
Mr.
Jennings
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
observe
that
he
hold
his
hat
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
call
on
my
aunt
,
Mrs.
Ablewhite
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
reply
that
he
have
a
patient
to
see
,
and
that
he
be
walk
my
way
.
  
<EOS>
We
leave
the
house
together
.
<EOS>
I
observe
that
the
pretty
servant
girl
 
who
be
all
smile
and
amiability
,
when
I
wish
her
good
morning
on
my
way
out
 
receive
a
modest
little
message
from
Ezra
Jennings
,
relate
to
the
time
at
which
he
may
be
expect
to
return
,
with
purse
-
up
lip
,
and
with
eye
which
ostentatiously
look
anywhere
rather
than
look
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
the
poor
wretch
be
evidently
no
favourite
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
out
of
the
house
,
I
have
Betteredge
's
word
for
it
that
he
be
unpopular
everywhere
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
a
life
!
<EOS>
"
I
think
to
myself
,
as
we
descend
the
doctor
's
doorstep
.
  
<EOS>
have
already
refer
to
Mr.
Candy
's
illness
on
his
side
,
Ezra
Jennings
now
appear
determined
to
leave
it
to
me
to
resume
the
subject
.
<EOS>
His
silence
say
significantly
,
"
It
be
your
turn
now
.
<EOS>
"
I
,
too
,
have
my
reason
for
refer
to
the
doctor
's
illness
:
and
I
readily
accept
the
responsibility
of
speak
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
judge
by
the
change
I
see
in
him
,
"
I
begin
,
"
Mr.
Candy
's
illness
must
have
be
far
more
serious
that
I
have
suppose
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
almost
a
miracle
,
"
say
Ezra
Jennings
,
"
that
he
live
through
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
his
memory
never
any
well
than
I
have
find
it
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
He
have
be
try
to
speak
to
me
 
"
  
"
of
something
which
happen
before
he
be
take
ill
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
assistant
,
observe
that
I
hesitate
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
memory
of
event
,
at
that
past
time
,
be
hopelessly
enfeeble
,
"
say
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
almost
to
be
deplore
,
poor
fellow
,
that
even
the
wreck
of
it
remain
.
<EOS>
while
he
remember
dimly
plan
that
he
form
 
thing
,
here
and
there
,
that
he
have
to
say
or
do
before
his
illness
 
<EOS>
he
be
perfectly
incapable
of
recall
what
the
plan
be
,
or
what
the
thing
be
that
he
have
to
say
or
do
.
<EOS>
He
be
painfully
conscious
of
his
own
deficiency
,
and
painfully
anxious
,
as
you
must
have
see
,
to
hide
it
from
observation
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
only
have
recover
in
a
complete
state
of
oblivion
as
to
the
past
,
he
would
have
be
a
happy
man
.
<EOS>
perhaps
we
should
all
be
happy
,
"
he
add
,
with
a
sad
smile
,
"
if
we
could
but
completely
forget
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
some
event
surely
in
all
man
's
life
,
"
I
reply
,
"
the
memory
of
which
they
would
be
unwilling
entirely
to
lose
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
is
,
I
hope
,
to
be
say
of
most
man
,
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
it
can
not
truly
be
say
of
all
.
<EOS>
have
you
any
reason
to
suppose
that
the
lose
remembrance
which
Mr.
Candy
try
to
recover
 
while
you
be
speak
to
him
just
now
 
be
a
remembrance
which
it
be
important
to
you
that
he
should
recall
?
"
  
<EOS>
in
say
those
word
,
he
have
touch
,
of
his
own
accord
,
on
the
very
point
upon
which
I
be
anxious
to
consult
him
.
<EOS>
the
interest
I
feel
in
this
strange
man
have
impel
me
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
give
him
the
opportunity
of
speak
to
me
;
reserve
what
I
may
have
to
say
,
on
my
side
,
in
relation
to
his
employer
,
until
I
be
first
satisfied
that
he
be
a
person
in
whose
delicacy
and
discretion
I
could
trust
.
<EOS>
the
little
that
he
have
say
,
thus
far
,
have
be
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
I
be
speak
to
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
have
what
I
may
venture
to
describe
as
the
UNSOUGHT
self
-
possession
,
which
be
a
sure
sign
of
good
breeding
,
not
in
England
only
,
but
everywhere
else
in
the
civilised
world
.
<EOS>
whatever
the
object
which
he
have
in
view
,
in
put
the
question
that
he
have
just
address
to
me
,
I
feel
no
doubt
that
I
be
justify
 
so
far
 
in
answer
him
without
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
have
a
strong
interest

<EOS>
from

fever

no

<EOS>
I
send
at
once
to
two
of
Mr.

medical
friend
in
the
town
,
both
physician
,
to
come
and
give
me
their
opinion
of
the
case

<EOS>
They
agree
with
me
that
it
look
serious
;
but
they
both
strongly
dissent
from
the
view
I
take
of
the
treatment
.
<EOS>
We
differ
entirely
in
the
conclusion
which
we
draw
from
the
patient
's
pulse
.
<EOS>
the
two
doctor
,
argue
from
the
rapidity
of
the
beat
,
declare
that
a
lower
treatment
be
the
only
treatment
to
be
adopt
.
<EOS>
on
my
side
,
I
admit
the
rapidity
of
the
pulse
,
but
I
also
point
to
its
alarm
feebleness
as
indicate
an
exhausted
condition
of
the
system
,
and
as
show
a
plain
necessity
for
the
administration
of
stimulant
.
<EOS>
the
two
doctor
be
for
keep
him
on
gruel
,
lemonade
,
barley
-
water
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
I
be
for
give
him
champagne
,
or
brandy
,
ammonia
,
and
quinine
.
<EOS>
a
serious
difference
of
opinion
,
as
you
see
!
<EOS>
a
difference
between
two
physician
of
establish
local
repute
,
and
a
stranger
who
be
only
an
assistant
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
few
day
,
I
have
no
choice
but
to
give
way
to
my
elder
and
better
;
the
patient
steadily
sink
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
make
a
second
attempt
to
appeal
to
the
plain
,
undeniably
plain
,
evidence
of
the
pulse
.
<EOS>
Its
rapidity
be
unchecked
,
and
its
feebleness
have
increase
.
<EOS>
the
two
doctor
take
offence
at
my
obstinacy
.
<EOS>
They
say
,
"
Mr.

five

when

expire

You
positively
refuse

try
the
stimulant

<EOS>
They
refuse
in

down

cellar

bottle
of
champagne

<EOS>
"
in
my
place

Mr.

you
would
have
remember
that
Mr.

have
take
you
into
his
employment

under
circumstance
which
make
you
his
debtor

life

<EOS>
in

place

you
would
have
see
him
sink
,
hour
by
hour
;
and
you
would
have
risk
anything
,
rather
than
let
the
one
man
on
earth
who
have
befriend
you

die
before
your
eye

<EOS>
do
not
suppose
that
I
have
no
sense
of
the
terrible
position
in
which
I
have
place
myself

<EOS>
there
be
moment
when
I
feel
all
the
misery
of
my
friendlessness

all
the
peril

my
dreadful
responsibility

if
I
have
be

happy

prosperous
life

I
believe
I
should
have
sink
under
the
task

on
myself

I
have
no
happy
time
to
look
back
at
,
no
past
peace
of
mind
to
force
itself
into
contrast
with
my
present
anxiety
and
suspense
 
<EOS>
and
I
hold
firm
to
my
resolution
through
it
all
.
<EOS>
I
take
an
interval
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
when
my
patient
's
condition
be
at
its
good
,
for
the
repose
I
need
.
<EOS>
for
the
rest
of
the
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
,
as
long
as
his
life
be
in
danger
,
I
never
leave
his
bedside
.
<EOS>
towards
sunset
,
as
usual
in
such
case
,
the
delirium
incidental
to
the
fever
come
on
.
<EOS>
It
last
more
or
less
through
the
night
;
and
then
intermit
,
at
that
terrible
time
in
the
early
morning
 
from
two
o'clock
to
five
 
when
the
vital
energy
even
of
the
healthy
of
us
be
at
their
low
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
that
death
gather
in
his
human
harvest
most
abundantly
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
that
death
<EOS>
and
I
fight
our
fight
over
the
bed
,
which
should
have
the
man
who
lie
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
hesitate
in
pursue
the
treatment
on
which
I
have
stake
everything
.
<EOS>
when
wine
fail
,
I
try
brandy
.
<EOS>
when
the
other
stimulant
lose
their
influence
,
I
double
the
dose
.
<EOS>
after
an
interval
of
suspense
 
the
like
of
which
I
hope
to
God
I
shall
never
feel
again
 
there
come
a
day
when
the
rapidity
of
the
pulse
slightly
,

appreciably
,
diminish
;
and
,
better
still
,
there
come
also
a
change
in
the
beat
 
an
unmistakable
change
to
steadiness

strength

then
,
I
know
that
I
have
save
him

then
I
own
I
break
down

I
lay
the
poor
fellow

waste
hand
back

burst
out
cry

an
hysterical
relief

that
bitterly
professional
apology
for
his
tear

quietly

unaffectedly

he
have
speak
throughout

His
tone

manner

from
begin

show
him
to
be
especially

almost
morbidly

anxious
not

It

the
only
way
I
can
see
,
Mr.

of
properly
introduce
to
you
what
I
have
to
say
next
.
<EOS>
now
you
know
exactly
what
my
position
be
,
at
the
time
of
Mr.

illness

you
will
the
more
readily
understand
the
sore
need
I
have
of
lighten
the
burden
on
my
mind
by
give
it
,
at
interval
,
some
sort
of
relief

<EOS>
I
have
have
the
presumption
to
occupy
my
leisure
,
for
some
year
past
,
in
write
a
book
,
address
to
the
member
of
my
profession
 
<EOS>
a
book
on
the
intricate
and
delicate
subject
of
the
brain

the
nervous
system

<EOS>
My
work
will
probably
never
be
finish
;
and
it
will
certainly
never
be
publish
.
<EOS>
It
have
none
the
less
be
the
friend
of
many
lonely
hour
;
and
it
help
me
to
while
away
the
anxious
time
 
<EOS>
the
time
of
waiting
,
and
nothing
else
 
at
Mr.
Candy
's
bedside
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
he
be
delirious
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
and
I
mention
the
time
at
which
his
delirium
come
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
have
reach
a
section
of
my
book
,
at
that
time
,
which
touch
on
this
same
question
of
delirium
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
trouble
you
at
any
length
with
my
theory
on
the
subject
 
I
will
confine
myself
to
tell
you
only
what
it
be
your
present
interest
to
know
.
<EOS>
It
have
often
occur
to
me
in
the
course
of
my
medical
practice
,
to
doubt
whether
we
can
justifiably
infer
 
in
case
of
delirium
 
that
the
loss
of
the
faculty
of
speak
connectedly
,
imply
of
necessity
the
loss
of
the
faculty
of
thinking
connectedly
as
well
.
<EOS>
poor
Mr.
Candy
's
illness
give
me
an
opportunity
of
put
this
doubt
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
I
understand
the
art
of
writing
in
shorthand
;
and
I
be
able
to
take
down
the
patient
's
"
wandering
'
,
exactly
as
they
fall
from
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
see
,
Mr.
Blake
,
what
I
be
come
to
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
see
it
clearly
,
and
wait
with
breathless
interest
to
hear
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
odd
and
end
of
time
,
"
Ezra
Jennings
go
on
,
"
I
reproduce
my
shorthand
note
,
in
the
ordinary
form
of
writing
 
leave
large
space
between
the
broken
phrase
,
and
even
the
single
word
,
as
they
have
fall
disconnectedly
from
Mr.
Candy
's
lip
.
<EOS>
I
then
treat
the
result
thus
obtain
,
on
something
like
the
principle
which
one
adopt
in
put
together
a
child
's
"
puzzle
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
confusion
to
begin
with
;
but
it
may
be
all
bring
into
order
and
shape
,
if
you
can
only
find
the
right
way
.
<EOS>
act
on
this
plan
,
I
fill
in
each
blank
space
on
the
paper
,
with
what
the
word
or
phrase
on
either
side
of
it
suggest
to
me
as
the
speaker
's
meaning
;
alter
over
and
over
again
,
until
my
addition
follow
naturally
on
the
spoken
word
which
come
before
them
,
and
fit
naturally
into
the
spoken
word
which
come
after
them
.
<EOS>
the
result
be
,
that
I
not
only
occupy
in
this
way
many
vacant
and
anxious
hour
,
but
that
I
arrive
at
something
which
be
(
as
it
seem
to
me
)
<EOS>
a
confirmation
of
the
theory
that
I
hold
.
<EOS>
in
plainer
word
,
after
put
the
broken
sentence
together
I
find
the
superior
faculty
of
thinking
go
on
,
more
or
less
connectedly
,
in
my
patient
's
mind
,
while
the
inferior
faculty
of
expression
be
in
a
state
of
almost
complete
incapacity
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
word
!
"
<EOS>
I
interpose
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
do
my
name
occur
in
any
of

wandering
?

You
shall
hear
,
Mr.
Blake

among
my
write
proof
of
the
assertion

I
have
just
advance

I
ought
to

experiment

tend

put
my
assertion
to
the
proof
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
,
in
which
your
name
occur
.
<EOS>
for
nearly
the
whole
of
one
night
,
Mr.
Candy
's
mind
be
occupy
with
something
between
himself
and
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
the
broken
word
,
as
they
drop
from
his
lip
,
on
one
sheet
of
paper
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
get
the
link
of
my
own
discovering
which
connect
those
word
together
,
on
another
sheet
of
paper
.
<EOS>
the
product
(
as
the
arithmeticians
would
say
)
be
an
intelligible
statement
 
first
,
of
something
actually
do
in
the
past
;
secondly
,
of
something
which
Mr.
Candy
contemplate
do
in
the
future
,
if
his
illness
have
not
get
in
the
way
,
and
stop
him
.
<EOS>
the
question
be
whether
this
do
,
or
do
not
,
represent
the
lost
recollection
which
he
vainly
attempt
to
find
when
you
call
on
him
this
morning
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
a
doubt
of
it
!

"
<EOS>
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
let
us
go
back
directly
,
and
look
at
the
paper
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
impossible
,
Mr.
Blake
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
put
yourself
in
my
position
for
a
moment
,
"
say
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
disclose
to
another
person
what
have
drop
unconsciously
from
the
lip
of
your
suffering
patient
and
your
helpless
friend
,
without
first
know
that
there
be
a
necessity
to
justify
you
in
open
your
lip
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
feel
that
he
be
unanswerable
,
here
;
but
I
try
to
argue
the
question
,
nevertheless
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
conduct
in
such
a
delicate
matter
as
you
describe
,
"
I
reply
,
"
would
depend
greatly
on
whether
the
disclosure
be
of
a
nature
to
compromise
my
friend
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
dispose
of
all
necessity

that
side
of
the
question

long
since

Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
"
wherever
my
note

anything

harmless
as

I

miserably
ill

Mr.

he

so
helplessly
dependent
upon
Me

<EOS>
be
it
too
much
to
ask
,
if
I
request
you
only
to
hint
to
me
what
your
interest
be
in
the
lost
recollection

<EOS>
what
you
believe

lose
recollection
to
be

"
  
<EOS>
to
have
answer
him
with
the
frankness
which
his
language
and
his
manner
both
claim
from
me
,
would
have
be
to
commit
myself
to
openly
acknowledge
that
I
be
suspect
of
the
theft
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
strongly
as
Ezra
Jennings
have
intensify
the
first
impulsive
interest
which
I
have
feel
in
him
,
he
have
not
overcome
my
unconquerable
reluctance
to
disclose
the
degrade
position
in
which
I
stand
.
<EOS>
I
take
refuge
once
more
in
the
explanatory
phrase
with
which
I
have
prepare
myself
to
meet
the
curiosity
of
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
this
time
I
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
a
want
of
attention
on
the
part

the
person

I
address

Ezra

listen
patiently

even
anxiously

until
I
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry

no

<EOS>
We
arrive
,

at

His
voice
tell
me
that
he
speak
sincerely

<EOS>
His
soft
brown
eye
rest
on
me
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
melancholy
interest

<EOS>
He
bow
,
and
go
,
without
another
word
,
on
his
way
to
the
village

<EOS>
for
a
minute
or
more
I
stand
and
watch
him
,
walk
farther
and
farther
away
from
me
;
carry
farther
and
farther
away
with
him
what
I
now
firmly
believe
to
be
the
clue
of
which
I
be
in
search

He
turn
,
after

on

little
way

look
back

<EOS>
see
me
still
stand
at
the
place

we
have
part

stop
,
as

be
no

out

remind
myself

at
what
may
be
the
turning
point

all
to
flatter
nothing
more
important

esteem

<EOS>
there
be
only
time
to
call
him
back
first
,

to
think
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
I
be
one
of
the
rash
of

<EOS>
I
call
him
back

then
I

some
terrible
emotion

shake
him

the
soul

His
gipsy
complexion
have
alter
to
a
livid
greyish
paleness

his

have
suddenly
become
wild

glitter

his

have
drop
to
a
tone
 
low

stern
,

resolute
 
which
I
now
hear
for

up

a

hundred

at

ground

screen
by
bush

lay
aside
his
hat

pass
his

wearily
over
his
forehead

wearily
through
his
startling
white
and
black
hair

toss
his
little
nosegay
of
wild
flower
away
from
him

it
recall

miserable
year
.
<EOS>
It
end
in
my
drifting
to
this
place
,
and
meet
with
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
He
want
an
assistant
.
<EOS>
I
refer
him
,
on
the
question
of
capacity
,
to
my
last
employer
.
<EOS>
the
question
of
character
remain
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
what
I
have
tell
you
 
and
more
.
<EOS>
I
warn
him
that
there
be
difficulty
in
the
way
,
even
if
he
believe
me
.
"
<EOS>
here
,
as
elsewhere
,
"
I
say
"
I
scorn
the
guilty
evasion
of
live
under
an
assumed
name
:
I
be
no
safe
at
Frizinghall
than
at
other
place
from
the
cloud
that
follow
me
,
go
where
I
may
.
"
<EOS>
He
answer
,
"
I
do
not
do
thing
by
half
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
,
and
I
pity
you
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
risk
what
may
happen
,
I
will
risk
it
too
.
"
<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
him
!
<EOS>
He
have
give
me
shelter
<EOS>
,
he
have
give
me
employment
,
he
have
give
me
rest
of
mind
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
the
certain
conviction
<EOS>
(
I
have
have
it
for
some
month
past
)
that
nothing
will
happen
now
to
make
him
regret
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
slander
have
die
out
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
slander
be
as
active
as
ever
.
<EOS>
but
when
it
follow
me
here
,
it
will
come
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
leave
the
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Mr.
Blake
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
dead
.
<EOS>
for
ten
year
past
I
have
suffer
from
an
incurable
internal
complaint
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
disguise
from
you
that
I
should
have
let
the
agony
of
it
kill
me
long
since
,
but
for
one
last
interest
in
life
,
which
make
my
existence
of
some
importance
to
me
still
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
provide
for
a
person
 
very
dear
to
me
 
whom
I
shall
never
see
again
.
<EOS>
My
own
little
patrimony
be
hardly
sufficient
to
make
her
independent
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
the
hope
,
if
I
could
only
live
long
enough
,
of
increase
it
to
a
certain
sum
,
have
impel
me
to
resist
the
disease
by
such
palliative
mean
as
I
could
devise
.
<EOS>
the
one
effectual
palliative
in
my
case
,
be
 
opium
.
<EOS>
to
that
all
-
potent
and
all
-
merciful
drug
I
be
indebte
for
a
respite
of
many
year
from
my
sentence
of
death
.
<EOS>
but
even
the
virtue
of
opium
have
their
limit
.
<EOS>
the
progress
of
the
disease
have
gradually
force
me
from
the
use
of
opium
to
the
abuse
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
feel
the
penalty
at
last
.
<EOS>
My
nervous
system
be
shatter
;
my
night
be
night
of
horror
.
<EOS>
the
end
be
not
far
off
now
.
<EOS>
let
it
come
 
I
have
not
live
and
work
in
vain
.
<EOS>
the
little
sum
be
nearly
make
up
;
and
I
have
the
mean
of
complete
it
,
if
my
last
reserve
of
life
fail
me
sooner
than
I
expect
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
I
have
wander
into
tell
you
this
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
be
mean
enough
to
appeal
to
your
pity
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
I
fancy
you
may
be
all
the
ready
to
believe
me
,
if
you
know
that
what
I
have
say
to
you
,
I
have
say
with
the
certain
knowledge
in
me
that
I
be
a
die
man
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
disguising
,
Mr.
Blake
,
that
you
interest
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
attempt
to
make
my
poor
friend
's
loss
of
memory
the
mean
of
better
my
acquaintance
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
speculate
on
the
chance
of
your
feel
a
pass
curiosity
about
what
he
want
to
say
,
and
of
my
be
able
to
satisfy
it
.
<EOS>
be
there
no
excuse
for
my
intrude
myself
on
you
?
<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
some
excuse
.
<EOS>
a
man
who
have
live
as
I
have
live
have
his
bitter
moment
when
he
ponder
over
human
destiny
.
<EOS>
You
have
youth
,
health
,
rich
,
a
place
in
the
world
,
a
prospect
before
you
.
<EOS>
You
,
and
such
as
you
,
show
me
the
sunny
side
of
human
life
,
and
reconcile
me
with
the
world
that
I
be
leave
,
before
I
go
.
<EOS>
however
this
talk
between
us
may
end
,
I
shall
not
forget
that
you
have
do
me
a
kindness
in
do
that
.
<EOS>
It
rest
with
you
,
sir
,
to
say
what
you
propose
say
,
or
to
wish
me
good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
answer
to
make
to
that
appeal
.
<EOS>
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
I
tell
him
the
truth
,
as
unreservedly
as
I
have
tell
it
in
these
page
.
  
<EOS>
He
start
to
his
foot
,
and
look
at
me
with
breathless
eagerness
as
I
approach
the
lead
incident
of
my
story
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
certain
that
I
go
into
the
room
,
"
I
say
;
"
it
be
certain
that
I
take
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
meet
those
two
plain
fact
by

that
,
do
what
I
may
,
I
do
it
without
my

knowledge
 
"
  
<EOS>
Ezra
Jennings
catch
me
excitedly
by
the
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
stop
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
suggest
more
to
me
than

have
you

accustomed
to

<EOS>

I

I
sleep
soundly

<EOS>
He
drop
my
arm
as
suddenly
as
he
have
take
it
 
and
look
at
me
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
mind
be

of
the
last
doubt
that
rest
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
marked
day
in
your
life
,
and
in
mine

"
he
say
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
absolutely
certain
,
Mr.
Blake
,
of
one
thing
 
I
have
get
what
Mr.
Candy
want
to

to

this
morning

I
believe
the
vindication
of
your

<EOS>
"
explain
yourself
,
for
God
's
sake

<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
excitement
of
our
colloquy
,
we
have
walk
on
a
few
step
,
beyond
the
clump
of
dwarf
tree
which
have
hitherto
screen
us
from
view
.
<EOS>
before
Ezra
Jennings
could
answer
me
,
he
be
hail
from
the
high
road
by
a
man
,
in
great
agitation
,
who
have
be
evidently
on
the
look
-
out
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
,
"
he
call
back
;
"
I
be
come
as
fast
as
I
can

<EOS>
He
turn
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
an
urgent

village
yonder

give

two

at
Mr.

again

be
I

I
exclaim

impatiently

not
you

my

this
be
far

serious

not

try
your

only
be
add
to
your

at
Frizinghall

hour

time

<EOS>
the
man
on
the
high
road
hail
him
again
.
<EOS>
He
hurry
away
,
and
leave
me
.
    
<EOS>
how
the
interval
of
suspense
in
which
I
be
now
condemn
may
have
affect
other
man
in
my
position
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
say
.
<EOS>
the
influence
of
the
two
hour
'
probation
upon
my
temperament
be
simply
this
.
<EOS>
I
feel
physically
incapable
of
remain
still
in
any
one
place
,
and
morally
incapable
of
speak
to
any
one
human
being
,
until
I
have
first
hear
all
that
Ezra
Jennings
have
to
say
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
frame
of
mind
,
I
not
only
abandon
my
contemplate
visit
to
Mrs.
Ablewhite
 
<EOS>
I
even
shrink
from
encounter
Gabriel
Betteredge
himself
.
  
<EOS>
return
to
Frizinghall
,
I
leave
a
note
for
Betteredge
,
tell
him
that
I
have
be
unexpectedly
call
away
for
a
few
hour
,
but
that
he
may
certainly
expect
me
to
return
towards
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
request
him
,
in
the
interval
,
to
order
his
dinner
at
the
usual
hour
,
and
to
amuse
himself
as
he
please
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
as
I
well
know
,
host
of
friend
in
Frizinghall
;
and
he
would
be
at
no
loss
how
to
fill
up
his
time
until
I
return
to
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
this
done
,
I
make
the
good
of
my
way
out
of
the
town
again
,
and
roam
the
lonely
moorland
country
which
surround
Frizinghall
,
until
my
watch
tell
me
that
it
be
time
,
at
last
,
to
return
to
Mr.
Candy
's
house
.

I
find
Ezra
Jennings
ready

wait
for
me

come
in
as
intruder
on
a
silence

nothing

shudder
inwardly

familiar

use
of
Ezra
Jennings
'
room

<EOS>
I
draw
up
to
the
table
;
and
Ezra

hand
me
his
manuscript
note

<EOS>
They

of
two
large

completely

<EOS>
in
the
irritated
state
of
my
curiosity

at
that
moment

I
lay
aside
the
second
sheet

paper
in
despair

He
look
at

with

smile
on

the
kindly
interest
in
his
soft
brown
eye

You

your
sleeplessness
to
something

to
what
?

"
to
my
leaving
off
smoking
.

you

Betteredge
be
perfectly
right
,
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
when
smoking
be
a
habit
a
man
must
have
no
common
constitution
who
can
leave
it
off
suddenly
without
some
temporary
damage
to
his
nervous
system

Your
sleepless
night

account
for
,
to
my

<EOS>
My
next
question
refer
to
Mr.
Candy
.
<EOS>
do
you
remember
have
enter
into
anything
like
a
dispute
with
him
 
at
the
birthday
dinner
,
or
afterwards
 
on
the
subject
of
his
profession
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
question
instantly
awaken
one
of
my
dormant
remembrance
in
connection
with
the
birthday
festival
.
<EOS>
the
foolish
wrangle
which
take
place
,
on
that
occasion
,
between
Mr.
Candy
and
myself
,
will
be
find
describe
at
much
great
length
than
it
deserve
in
the
tenth
chapter
of
Betteredge
's
Narrative
.
<EOS>
the
detail
there
present
of
the
dispute
 
so
little
<EOS>
have
I
think
of
it
afterwards
 
entirely
fail
to
recur
to
my
memory
.
<EOS>
all
that
I
could
now
recall
,
and
all
that
I
could
tell
Ezra
Jennings
be
,
that
I
have
attack
the
art
of
medicine
at
the
dinner
-
table
with
sufficient
rashness
and
sufficient
pertinacity
to
put
even
Mr.
Candy
out
of
temper
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
I
also
remember
that
Lady
Verinder
have
interfere
to
stop
the
dispute
,
and
that
the
little
doctor
and
I
have
"
make
it
up
again
,
"
as
the
child
say
,
and
have
become
as
good
friend
as
ever
,
before
we
shake
hand
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
one
thing
more
,
"
say
Ezra
Jennings
,
"
which
it
be
very
important
I
should
know
.
<EOS>
have
you
any
reason

any
special
anxiety

the
Diamond

at
this

<EOS>

I
have
the
strong
reason
for

anxiety
about

Diamond

it
to
be
the
object
of
a
conspiracy
;
and
I

warn

take
measure

Miss
Verinder

protection
,
as
the
possessor
of
the
stone

astounding

take
the
Diamond
,
in
a
state
of
trance
,
produce
by
opium
.

secondly
,
that
the
opium
be
give
to
you
by
Mr.

without
your
own
knowledge
 
as
a
practical
refutation
of
the
opinion

you
have
express

birthday
dinner

<EOS>
I

the

gently

He

do
dreadful
mischief

<EOS>
if

will
look
at

you
will
see
that

for
his
illness
 
he
would
have
return
to
Lady

be
the
morning
after
the
party
,
and
would
have
acknowledge
the
trick
that
he
have

Miss

would
have
hear
of
it

Miss
Verinder
would
have
question
him

the
truth

the

get
you

back

guiltless

point

I

I

walk
down

along

my
opening

shut
the

my
go
back

the
influence

first
to
stupefy
you

to
send
you
to
sleep

"
  
<EOS>
"
the
common

some
ten

large

on

come
within

I
anticipate
the
objection
you
have
just
make
:
and
I
have
again
provide
myself
with
independent
testimony

will
carry
its
due
weight
with
it

your
own
mind

in
the
mind

away

at

passage

you
will
find
that
when
De
Quincey
have
commit
what
he
call

a
debauch

he
either
go
to

bargaining
of
the

so
much
for
the
capacity

occupy
himself
actively
,

to
move
about
from
place
to
place
under

influence

opium

I

I

to
the
effect
produce
by
the
opium
on
myself

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
answer
you
in
a
few
word

"
say
Ezra

<EOS>
"
the
action
of
opium
be
comprise
,
in
the
majority
of
case
,
in
two
influence
 
a
stimulating
influence
first
,
and
a
sedative
influence
afterwards
.
<EOS>
under
the
stimulating
influence
,
the
late
and
most
vivid
impression
leave
on
your
mind
 
namely
,
the
impression
relate
to
the
Diamond
 
would
be
likely
,
in
your
morbidly
sensitive
nervous
condition
,
to
become
intensify
in
your
brain
,
and
would
subordinate
to
themselves
your
judgment
and
your
will
exactly
as
an
ordinary
dream
subordinate
to
itself
<EOS>
your
judgment
and
your
will

<EOS>
little
by
little
,
under
this
action
,
any
apprehension
about
the
safety
of
the
Diamond
which
you
may
have
feel
during
the
day
would
be
liable
to
develop
themselves
from
the
state
of
doubt
to
the
state
of
certainty
 
would
impel
you
into
practical
action
to
preserve
the
jewel
 
would
direct
your
step
,
with
that
motive
in
view
,
into
the
room
which
you
enter
 
and
would
guide
your
hand
to
the
drawer
of
the
cabinet
,
until
you
have
find
the
drawer
which
hold
the
stone
.
<EOS>
in
the
spiritualised
intoxication
of
opium
,
you
would
do
all
that
.
<EOS>
later
,
as
the
sedative
action
begin
to
gain
on
the
stimulant
action
,
you
would
slowly
become
inert
and
stupefy
.
<EOS>
later
still
you
would
fall
into
a
deep
sleep

<EOS>
when
the
morning
come

the
effect

be
all

off

you

wake

maintain
the
opinion

I
express
just
now

I

me

remind
you

your
opinion
also
rest

assumption

well

view
he
take
of
the

new
to
me

<EOS>
I
wait
anxiously
to
hear
how
he
would
defend
it

<EOS>
"
I
assume
,

pursue
Ezra
Jennings
,
"
that
the
influence
of
the
opium
 
after
impel
you
to
possess
yourself
of
the
Diamond
,
with
the
purpose
of
secure
its
safety
 
may
also
impel
you
,
act
under
the
same
influence
and
the
same
motive
,
to
hide
it
somewhere
in
your
own
room
.
<EOS>
you
assume
that
the
Hindoo
conspirator
could
by
no
possibility
commit
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
go
to
Mr.
Luker
's
house
after
the
Diamond
 
and
,
therefore
,
in
Mr.
Luker
's
possession
the
Diamond
must
be
!
<EOS>
have
you
any
evidence
to
prove
that
the
Moonstone
be
take
to
London
at
all
?
<EOS>
You
can
not
even
guess
how
,
or
by
whom

it

from
Lady
Verinder
's
house

<EOS>
have
you
any
evidence
that
the
jewel
be
pledge
to
Mr.
Luker

<EOS>
He
declare
that
he
never
hear
of
the
Moonstone
;
and
his
banker
'
receipt
acknowledge
nothing
but
the
deposit
of
a
valuable
of
great
price
.
<EOS>
the
Indians
assume
that
Mr.
Luker
be
lie
 
and
you
assume
again
that
the
Indians
be
right

<EOS>
all
I
say
,
in
differ
with
you

be
 
that
my
view
be
possible

<EOS>
what
more

Mr.

either
logically

can
be

<EOS>
It

put
strongly

there
be
no
denying
that
it

put
truly

"
I
confess
you
stagger

you

let
us
return
to
our
experiment

We

decide

off

smoking

"
from
this
moment

<EOS>
"
that
be
the
first
step

<EOS>
the
next
step

we
can
,
the
domestic
circumstance
which
surround
you
last
year

<EOS>
how
be
this

do

Godfrey
Ablewhite

<EOS>
It
be
simply
impossible
to
reassemble
the
people
who
have
inhabit
the
house
,
when
I
have
sleep
in
it
last
.
<EOS>
the
statement
of
this
objection
do
not
appear
to
embarrass
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
He
attach
very
little
importance
,
he
say
,
to
reassemble
the
same
people
 
see
that
it
would
be
vain
to
expect
them
to
reassume
the
various
position
which
they
have
occupy
towards
me
in
the
past
time
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
he
consider
it
essential
to
the
success
of
the
experiment
,
that
I
should
see
the
same
object
about
me
which
have
surround
me
when
I
be
last
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
above
all
thing
,
"
he
say
,
"
you
must
sleep
in
the
room

you
sleep
in

on

birthday
night

it

<EOS>
the

Rose
late
,
after
a
dreadful
night
;
the
vengeance
of
yesterday
's
opium
,
pursue
me
through
a
series
of
frightful
dream
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
I
be
whirl
through
empty
space
with
the
phantom
of
the
dead
,
friend
and
enemy
together
.
<EOS>
at
another
,
the
one
beloved
face
which
I
shall
never
see
again
,
rise
at
my
bedside
,
hideously
phosphorescent
in
the
black
darkness
,
and
glare
and
grin
at
me
.
<EOS>
a
slight
return
of
the
old
pain
,
at
the
usual
time
in
the
early
morning
,
be
welcome
as
a
change
.
<EOS>
It
dispel
the
vision
 
and
it
be
bearable
because
it
do
that

<EOS>
My
bad
night
make
it
late
in
the
morning
,
before
I
could
get
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
stretch
on
the
sofa
,
breakfast
on
brandy
and
soda
-
water
,
and
a
dry
biscuit
.
  
<EOS>

well

a
miserable
,
restless
night

a
total
failure
of
appetite
this
morning

exactly
what
happen
last
year
,
when
I
give
up
my
cigar

sooner
I
be
ready

laudanum

pleased

it

become
exhausted

<EOS>
I
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
appear
to
think
,
yesterday
,
that
our
experiment
with
the
opium
be
not
likely
to
be
view
very
favourably
by
some
of
my
friend
.
<EOS>
You
be
quite
right
.
<EOS>
I
call
old
Gabriel
Betteredge
one
of
my
friend
;
and
you
will
be
amuse
to
hear
that
he
protest
strongly
when
I
see
him
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
do
a
wonderful
number
of
foolish
thing
in

course
of

Mr.
Franklin

but
this
top
them
all
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
there
be
Betteredge
's
opinion
!
<EOS>
You
will
make
allowance
for
his
prejudice
,
I
be
sure
,
if
you
and
he
happen
to
meet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
leave
Mr.
Blake
,
to
go
my
round
among
my
patient
;
feel
the
well
and
the
happy
even
for
the
short
interview
that
I
have
have
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
secret
of
the
attraction
that
there
be
for
me
in
this
man
?
<EOS>
do
it
only
mean
that
I
feel
the
contrast
between
the
frankly
kind
manner
in
which
he
have
allow
me
to
become
acquainted
with
him
,
and
the
merciless
dislike
and
distrust
with
which
I
be
meet
by
other
people
?
<EOS>
or
be
there
really
something
in
him
which
answer
to
the
yearning
that
I
have
for
a
little
human
sympathy
 
<EOS>
the
yearning
,
which
have
survive
the
solitude
and
persecution
of
many
year
;
which
seem
to
grow
keen
and
keener
,
as
the
time
come
nearer
and
near
when
I
shall
endure
and
feel
no
more
?
<EOS>
how
useless
to
ask
these
question
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
have
give
me
a
new
interest
in
life
.
<EOS>
let
that
be
enough
,
without
seek
to
know
what
the
new
interest
be

June
17th
.
 
<EOS>
before
breakfast
,
this
morning
,
Mr.
Candy
inform
me
that
he
be
go
away
for
a
fortnight
,
on
a
visit
to
a
friend
in
the
south
of
England
.
<EOS>
He
give
me
as
many
special
direction
,
poor
fellow
,
about
the
patient
,
as
if
he
still
have
the
large
practice
which
he
possess
before
he
be
take
ill
.
<EOS>
the
practice
be
worth
little
enough
now
!
<EOS>
other
doctor
have
supersede
him
;
and
nobody
who
can
help
it
will
employ
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
perhaps
fortunate
that
he
be
to
be
away
just
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
mortify
if
I
have
not
inform
him
of
the
experiment
which
I
be
go
to
try
with
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
and
I
hardly
know
what
undesirable
result
may
not
have
happen
,
if
I
have
take
him
into
my
confidence
.
<EOS>
better
as
it
be
.
<EOS>
unquestionably
,
well
as
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
post
bring
me
Miss
Verinder
's
answer
,
after
Mr.
Candy
have
leave
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
a
charming
letter
!
<EOS>
It
give
me
the
high
opinion
of
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
interest
that
she
feel
in
our
proceeding
.
<EOS>
She
tell
me
,
in
the
prettiest
manner
,
that
my
letter
have
satisfy
her
of
Mr.
Blake
's
innocence
,
without
the
slight
need
(
so
far
as
she
be
concern
)
of
put
my
assertion
to
the
proof
.
<EOS>
She
even
upbraid
herself
 
most
undeservedly
,
poor
thing
!
 
<EOS>
for
not
have
divine
at
the
time
what
the
true
solution
of
the
mystery
may
really
be
.
<EOS>
the
motive
underlie
all
this
proceed
evidently
from
something
more
than
a
generous
eagerness
to
make
atonement
for
a
wrong
which
she
have
innocently
inflict
on
another
person
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
she
have
love
him
,
throughout
the
estrangement
between
them
.
<EOS>
in
more
than
one
place
the
rapture
of
discover
that
he
have
deserve
to
be
love
,
break
its
way
innocently
through
the
stout
formality
of
pen
and
ink
,
and
even
defy
the
strong
restraint
still
of
write
to
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
be
it
possible
(
I
ask
myself
,
in
read
this
delightful
letter
)
that
I
,
of
all
man
in
the
world
,
be
choose
to
be
the
mean
of
bring
these
two
young
people
together
again
?
<EOS>
My
own
happiness
have
be
trample
under
foot
;
my
own
love
have
be
tear
from
me
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
live
to
see
a
happiness
of
other
,
which
be
of
my
making
 
a
love
renew
,
which
be
of
my
bringing
back
?
<EOS>
oh
merciful
death
,
let
me
see
it
before
your
arm
enfold
me
,
before
your
voice
whisper
to
me
,
"
rest
at
last
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
request
contain
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
prevent
me
from
show
it
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
I
be
authorise
to
tell
him
that
Miss
Verinder
willingly
consent
to
place
her
house
at
our
disposal
;
and
,
that
say
,
I
be
desire
to
add
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
so
far
,
it
be
easy
to
comply
with
her
wish
.
<EOS>
but
the
second
request
embarrass
me
seriously
.
  
<EOS>
not
content
with
have
write
to
Mr.
Betteredge
,
instruct
him
to
carry
out
whatever
direction
I
may
have
to
give
,
Miss
Verinder
ask
leave
to
assist
me
,
by
personally
superintend
the
restoration
of
her
own
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
only
wait
a
word
of
reply
from
me
to
make
the
journey
to
Yorkshire
,
and
to
be
present
as
one
of
the
witness
on
the
night
when
the
opium
be
try
for
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
again
,
there
be
a
motive
under
the
surface
;
and
,
here
again
,
I
fancy
that
I
can
find
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
what
she
have
forbid
me
to
tell
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
,
she
be
(
as
I
interpret
it
)
eager
to
tell
him
with
her
own
lip
,
before
he
be
put
to
the
test
which
be
to
vindicate
his
character
in
the
eye
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
I
understand
and
admire
this
generous
anxiety
to
acquit
him
,
without
wait
until
his
innocence
may
,
or
may
not
,
be
prove
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
atonement
that
she
be
long
to
make
,
poor
girl
,
after
have
innocently
and
inevitably
wrong
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
thing
can
not
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
sort
of
doubt
that
the
agitation
which
a
meeting
between
them
would
produce
on
both
side
 
revive
dormant
feeling
,
appeal
to
old
memory
,
awaken
new
hope
 
would
,
in
their
effect
on
the
mind
of
Mr.
Blake
,
be
almost
certainly
fatal
to
the
success
of
our
experiment
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
enough
,
as
thing
be
,
to
reproduce
in
him
the
condition
as
they
exist
,
or
nearly
as
they
exist
,
last
year
.
<EOS>
with
new
interest
and
new
emotion
to
agitate
him
,
the
attempt
would
be
simply
useless
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
know
this
,
I
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
disappoint
her
.
<EOS>
I
must
try
if
I
can
discover
some
new
arrangement
,
before
post
-
time
,
which
will
allow
me
to
say
yes
to
Miss
Verinder
,
without
damage
to
the
service
which
I
have
bind
myself
to
render
to
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
two
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
return
from
my
round
of
medical
visit
;
have
begin
,
of
course
,
by
call
at
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
's
report
of
the
night
be
the
same
as
before
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
some
interval
of
broken
sleep
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
but
he
feel
it
less
to
-
day
,
have
sleep
after
yesterday
's
dinner
.
<EOS>
this
after
-
dinner
sleep
be
the
result
,
no
doubt
,
of
the
ride
which
I
advise
him
to
take
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
shall
have
to
curtail
his
restorative
exercise
in
the
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
He
must
not
be
too
well
;
he
must
not
be
too
ill
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
case
(
as
a
sailor
would
say
)
of
very
fine
steering
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
hear
yet
from
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
eager
to
know
if
I
have
receive
any
answer
from
Miss
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
exactly
what
I
be
permit
to
tell
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
needless
to
invent
excuse
for
not
show
him
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
bitterly
enough
,
poor
fellow
,
that
he
understand
the
delicacy
which
disincline
me
to
produce
it
.
"
<EOS>
She
consent
,
of
course
,
as
a
matter
of
common
courtesy
and
common
justice
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
she
keep
her
own
opinion
of
me
,
and
wait
to
see
the
result
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorely
tempt
to
hint
that
he
be
now
wrong
her
as
she
have
wrong
him
.
<EOS>
on
reflection
,
I
shrink
from
forestall
her
in
the
double
luxury
of
surprising
and
forgive
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
visit
be
a
very
short
one
.
<EOS>
after
the
experience
of
the
other
night
,
I
have
be
compel
once
more
to
give
up
my
dose
of
opium
.
<EOS>
as
a
necessary
result
,
the
agony
of
the
disease
that
be
in
me
have
get
the
upper
hand
again
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
attack
come
on
,
and
leave
abruptly
,
so
as
not
to
alarm
or
distress
him
.
<EOS>
It
only
last
a
quarter
of
an
hour
this
time
,
and
it
leave
me
strength
enough
to
go
on
with
my
work
.
  
<EOS>
five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
write
my
reply
to
Miss
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
the
arrangement
I
have
propose
reconcile
the
interest
on
both
side
,
if
she
will
only
consent
to
it
.
<EOS>
after
first
state
the
objection
that
there
be
to
a
meeting
between
Mr.
Blake
and
herself
,
before
the
experiment
be
try
,
I
have
suggest
that
she
should
so
time
her
journey
as
to
arrive
at
the
house
privately
,
on
the
evening
when
we
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
travel
by
the
afternoon
train
from
London
,
she
would
delay
her
arrival
until
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
at
that
hour
,
I
have
undertake
to
see
Mr.
Blake
safely
into
his
bedchamber
;
and
so
to
leave
Miss
Verinder
free
to
occupy
her
own
room
until
the
time
come
for
administer
the
laudanum
.
<EOS>
when
that
have
be
do
,
there
can
be
no
objection
to
her
watch
the
result
,
with
the
rest
of
us
.
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
,
she
shall
show
Mr.
Blake
(
if
she
like
)
her
correspondence
with
me
,
and
shall
satisfy
him
in
that
way
that
he
be
acquit
in
her
estimation
,
before
the
question
of
his
innocence
be
put
to
the
proof
.
  
<EOS>
in
that
sense
,
I
have
write
to
her
.
<EOS>
this
be
all
that
I
can
do
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
I
must
see
Mr.
Betteredge
,
and
give
the
necessary
direction
for
reopen
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
June
18th
.
 
<EOS>
late
again
,
in
call
on
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
.
<EOS>
More
of
that
horrible
pain
in
the
early
morning
;
follow
,
this
time
,
by
complete
prostration
,
for
some
hour
.
<EOS>
I
foresee
,
in
spite
of
the
penalty
which
it
exact
from
me
,
that
I
shall
have
to
return
to
the
opium
for
the
hundredth
time
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
only
myself
to
think
of
,
I
should
prefer
the
sharp
pain
to
the
frightful
dream
.
<EOS>
but
the
physical
suffering
exhaust
me
.
<EOS>
if
I
let
myself
sink
,
it
may
end
in
my
become
useless
to
Mr.
Blake
at
the
time
when
he
want
me
most
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
one
o'clock
before
I
could
get
to
the
hotel
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
the
visit
,
even
in
my
shatter
condition
,
prove
to
be
a
most
amusing
one
 
thank
entirely
to
the
presence
on
the
scene
of
Gabriel
Betteredge
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
him
in
the
room
,
when
I
go
in
.
<EOS>
He
withdraw
to
the
window
and
look
out
,
while
I
put
my
first
customary
question
to
my
patient
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
have
sleep
badly
again
,
and
he
feel
the
loss
of
rest
this
morning
more
than
he
have
feel
it
yet
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
next
if
he
have
hear
from
Mr.
Bruff
.
  
<EOS>
a
letter
have
reach
him
that
morning
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
express
the
strong
disapproval
of
the
course
which
his
friend
and
client
be
take
under
my
advice
.
<EOS>
It
be
mischievous
 
for
it
excite
hope
that
may
never
be
realise
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
unintelligible
to
his
mind
,
except
that
it
look
like
a
piece
of
trickery
,
akin
to
the
trickery
of
mesmerism
,
clairvoyance
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
It
unsettle
Miss
Verinder
's
house
,
and
it
would
end
in
unsettling
Miss
Verinder
herself
.
<EOS>
He
have
put
the
case
(
without
mention
name
)
to
an
eminent
physician
;
and
the
eminent
physician
have
smile
,
have
shake
his
head
,
and
have
say
 
nothing
.
<EOS>
on
these
ground
,
Mr.
Bruff
enter
his
protest
,
and
leave
it
there
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
inquiry
relate
to
the
subject
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
have
the
lawyer
produce
any
evidence
to
prove
that
the
jewel
be
in
London
?
  
<EOS>
no
,
the
lawyer
have
simply
decline
to
discuss
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
be
himself
satisfied
that
the
Moonstone
have
be
pledge
to
Mr.
Luker
.
<EOS>
His
eminent
absent
friend
,
Mr.
Murthwaite
(
whose
consummate
knowledge
of
the
indian
character
no
one
could
deny
)
,
be
satisfied
also
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
and
with
the
many
demand
already
make
on
him
,
he
must
decline
enter
into
any
dispute
on
the
subject
of
evidence
.
<EOS>
Time
would
show
;
and
Mr.
Bruff
be
willing
to
wait
for
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
quite
plain
 
even
if
Mr.
Blake
have
not
make
it
plainer
still
by
report
the
substance
of
the
letter
,
instead
of
read
what
be
actually
write
 
that
distrust
of
me
be
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
have
myself
foresee
that
result
,
I
be
neither
mortify
nor
surprised
.
<EOS>
I
ask
Mr.
Blake
if
his
friend
's
protest
have
shake
him
.
<EOS>
He
answer
emphatically
,
that
it
have
not
produce
the
slight
effect
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
I
be
free
after
that
to
dismiss
Mr.
Bruff
from
consideration
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
dismiss
him
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
a
pause
in
the
talk
between
us
,
follow
 
and
Gabriel
Betteredge
come
out
from
his
retirement
at
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
favour
me
with
your
attention
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquire
,
address
himself
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
at
your
service
,
"
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
take
a
chair
and
seat
himself
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
produce
a
huge
old
-
fashioned
leather
pocket
-
book
,
with
a
pencil
of
dimension
to
match
.
<EOS>
have
put
on
his
spectacle
,
he
open
the
pocket
-
book
,
at
a
blank
page
,
and
address
himself
to
me
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
live
,
"
say
Betteredge
,
look
at
me
sternly
<EOS>
,
"
nigh
on

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
burst
out
laughing
.
<EOS>
I
attempt
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
hold
up
his

,
in

<EOS>
another
protest
against
our
contemplate
proceeding

<EOS>
from
a
lady
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
morning
's
post
bring
me
two
letter
.
<EOS>
one
from
Miss
Verinder
,
consenting
,
in
the
kind
manner
,
to
the
arrangement
that
I
have
propose
.
<EOS>
the
other
from
the
lady
under
whose
care
she
be
live
 
one
Mrs.
Merridew
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Merridew
present
her
compliment
,
and
do
not
pretend
to
understand
the
subject
on
which
I
have
be
correspond
with
Miss
Verinder
,
in
its
scientific
bearing
.
<EOS>
view
in
its
social
bearing
,
however
,
she
feel
free
to
pronounce
an
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
be
probably
,
Mrs.
Merridew
think
,
not
aware
that
Miss
Verinder
be
barely
nineteen
year
of
age
.
<EOS>
to
allow
a
young
lady
,
at
her
time
of
life
,
to
be
present
(
without
a
"
chaperone
"
)
in
a
house
full
of
man
among
whom
a
medical
experiment
be
be
carry
on
,
be
an
outrage
on
propriety
which
Mrs.
Merridew
can
not
possibly
permit
.
<EOS>
if
the
matter
be
allow
to
proceed
,
she
will
feel
it
to
be
her
duty
 
at
a
serious
sacrifice
of
her
own
personal
convenience
 
to
accompany
Miss
Verinder
to
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
she
venture
to
request
that
I
will
kindly
reconsider
the
subject
;
see
that
Miss
Verinder
decline
to
be
guide
by
any
opinion
but
mine
.
<EOS>
Her
presence
can
not
possibly
be
necessary
;
and
a
word
from
me
,
to
that
effect
,
would
relieve
both
Mrs.
Merridew
and
myself
of
a
very
unpleasant
responsibility
.
  
<EOS>
translate
from
polite
commonplace
into
plain
English
,
the
meaning
of
this
be
,
as
I
take
it
,
that
Mrs.
Merridew
stand
in
mortal
fear
of
the
opinion
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
have
unfortunately
appeal
to
the
very
last
man
in
existence
who
have
any
reason
to
regard
that
opinion
with
respect
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
disappoint
Miss
Verinder
;
and
I
will
not
delay
a
reconciliation
between
two
young
people
who
love
each
other
,
and
who
have
be
part
too
long
already
.
<EOS>
translate
from
plain
English
into
polite
commonplace
,
this
mean
that
Mr.
Jennings
present
his
compliment
to
Mrs.
Merridew
,
and
regret
that
he
can
not
feel
justified
in
interfere
any
farther
in
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
's
report

himself

We
determine
not

disturb
Betteredge

overlook
him
at

day

to

morrow
will
be
time
enough
for
our
first
visit

<EOS>
June
20th
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
be
begin
to
feel
his
continued
restlessness
at
night
.
<EOS>
the
sooner
the
room
be
refurnish
,
now
,
the
well
.
  
<EOS>
on
our
way
to
the
house
,
this
morning
,
he
consult
me
,
with
some
nervous
impatience
and
irresolution
,
about
a
letter
<EOS>
(
forward
to
him
from
London
)
which
he
have
receive
from
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
write
from
Ireland
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledge
the
receipt
(
through
his
housekeeper
)
of
a
card
and
message
which
Mr.
Blake
leave
at
his
residence
near
Dorking
,
and
announce
his
return
to
England
as
likely
to
take
place
in
a
week
or
less
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
he
request
to
be
favour
with
Mr.
Blake
's
reason
for
wish
to
speak
to
him
(
as
state
in
the
message
)
on
the
subject
of
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Blake
can
convict
him
of
have
make
any
serious
mistake
,
in
the
course
of
his
last
year
's
inquiry
concern
the
Diamond
,
he
will
consider
it
a
duty
(
after
the
liberal
manner
in
which
he
be
treat
by
the
late
Lady
Verinder
)
to
place
himself
at
that
gentleman
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
if
not
,
he
beg
permission
to
remain
in
his
retirement
,
surround
by
the
peaceful
horticultural
attraction
of
a
country
life
.
  
<EOS>
after
read
the
letter
,
I
have
no
hesitation
in
advise
Mr.
Blake
to
inform
Sergeant
Cuff
,
in
reply
,
of
all
that
have
happen
since
the
inquiry
be
suspend
last
year
,
and
to
leave
him
to
draw
his
own
conclusion
from
the
plain
fact
.
  
<EOS>
on
second
thought
I
also
suggest
invite
the
Sergeant
to
be
present
at
the
experiment
,
in
the
event
of
his
return
to
England
in
time
to
join
us
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
a
valuable
witness
to
have
,
in
any
case
;
and
,
if
I
prove
to
be
wrong
in
believe
the
Diamond
to
be
hide
in
Mr.
Blake
's
room
,
his
advice
may
be
of
great
importance
,
at
a
future
stage
of
the
proceeding
over
which
I
could
exercise
no
control
.
<EOS>
this
last
consideration
appear
to
decide
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
He
promise
to
follow
my
advice
.
  
<EOS>
the
sound
of
the
hammer
inform
us
that
the
work
of
re
-
furnishing
be
in
full
progress
,
as
we
enter
the
drive
that
lead
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
,
attire
for
the
occasion
in
a
fisherman
's
red
cap
,
and
an
apron
of
green
baize
,
meet
us
in
the
outer
hall
.
<EOS>
the
moment
he
see
me
,
he
pull
out
the
pocket
-
book
and
pencil
,
and
obstinately
insist
on
take
note
of
everything
that
I
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
look
where
we
may
,
we
find
,
as
Mr.
Blake
have
foretold
that
the
work
be
advance
as
rapidly
and
as
intelligently
as
it
be
possible
to
desire
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
still
much
to
be
do
in
the
inner
hall
,
and
in
Miss
Verinder
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
seem
doubtful
whether
the
house
would
be
ready
for
us
before
the
end
of
the
week
.
  
<EOS>
have
congratulate
Betteredge
on
the
progress
that
he
have
make
(
he
persist
in
take
note
every
time
I
open
my
lip
;
decline
,
at
the
same
time
,
to
pay
the
slight
attention
to
anything
say
by
Mr.
Blake
)
;
and
have
promise
to
return
for
a
second
visit
of
inspection
in
a
day
or
two
,
we
prepare
to
leave
the
house
,
go
out
by
the
back
way
.
<EOS>
before
we
be
clear
of
the
passage
downstairs
,
I
be
stop
by
Betteredge
,
just
as
I
be
pass
the
door
which
lead
into
his
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
I
say
two
word
to
you
in
private
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
in
a
mysterious
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
I
consent
of
course
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
walk
on
to
wait
for
me
in
the
garden
,
while
I
accompany
Betteredge
into
his
room
.
<EOS>
I
fully
anticipate
a
demand
for
certain
new
concession
,
follow
the
precedent
already
establish
in
the
case
of
the
stuff
buzzard
,
and
the
Cupid
's
wing
.
<EOS>
to
my
great
surprise
,
Betteredge
lay
his
hand
confidentially
on
my
arm
,
and
put
this
extraordinary
question
to
me
:
  
"
Mr.
Jennings
,
do
you
happen
to
be
acquaint
with
ROBINSON
crusoe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
answer
that
I
have
read
ROBINSON
crusoe
when
I
be
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
since
then
?
"
inquire
Betteredge
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
since
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
fall
back
a
few
step
,
and
look
at
me
with
an
expression
of
compassionate
curiosity
,
temper
by
superstitious
awe
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
not
read
ROBINSON
crusoe
since
he
be
a
child
,
"
say
Betteredge
,
speak
to
himself
 
not
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
's
try
how
ROBINSON
crusoe
strike
him
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
unlock
a
cupboard
in
a
corner
,
and
produce
a
dirty
and
dog'
-
eared
book
,
which
exhale
a
strong
odour
of
stale
tobacco
as
he
turn
over
the
leave
.
<EOS>
have

<EOS>
a
short
entry
must
suffice
in
my
journal
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
have
have
the
bad
night
that
he
have
pass
yet
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
oblige
,
greatly
against
my
will
,
to
prescribe
for
him
.
<EOS>
man
of
his
sensitive
organisation
be
fortunately
quick
in
feel
the
effect
of
remedial
measure
.
<EOS>
otherwise
,
I
should
be
incline
to
fear
that
he
will
be
totally
unfit
for
the
experiment
when
the
time
come
to
try
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
after
some
little
remission
of
my
pain
for
the
last
two
day
I
have
an
attack
this
morning
,
of
which
I
shall
say
nothing
but
that
it
have
decide
me
to
return
to
the
opium
.
<EOS>
I
shall
close
this
book
,
and
take
my
full
dose
 
five
hundred
drop
.
  
<EOS>
June
22nd
.
 
<EOS>
Our
prospect
look
well
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
's
nervous
suffering
be
greatly
allay
.
<EOS>
He
sleep
a
little
last
night
.
<EOS>
my
night
,
thank
to
the
opium
,
be
the
night
of
a
man
who
be
stunned
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
wake
this
morning
;
the
fitter
expression
would
be
,
that
I
recover
my
sense
.
  
<EOS>
We
drive
to
the
house
to
see
if
the
refurnishing
be
do
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
complete
to
-
morrow
 
Saturday
.
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Blake
foretold
,
Betteredge
raise
no
further
obstacle
.
<EOS>
from
first
to
last
,
he
be
ominously
polite
,
and
ominously
silent
.
  
<EOS>
My
medical
enterprise
(
as
Betteredge
call
it
)
must
now
,
inevitably
,
be
delay
until
Monday
next
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
evening
the
workman
will
be
late
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
,
the
establish
Sunday
tyranny
which
be
one
of
the
institution
of
this
free
country
,
so
time
the
train
as
to
make
it
impossible
to
ask
anybody
to
travel
to
us
from
London
.
<EOS>
until
Monday
come
,
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
but
to
watch
Mr.
Blake
carefully
,
and
to
keep
him
,
if
possible
,
in
the
same
state
in
which
I
find
him
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
,
I
have
prevail
on
him
to
write
to
Mr.
Bruff
,
make
a
point
of
it
that
he
shall
be
present
as
one
of
the
witness
.
<EOS>
I
especially
choose
the
lawyer
,
because
he
be
strongly
prejudiced
against
us
.
<EOS>
if
we
convince
him
,
we
place
our
victory
beyond
the
possibility
of
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
have
also
write
to
Sergeant
Cuff
;
and
I
have
send
a
line
to
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
with
these
,
and
with
old
Betteredge
(
who
be
really
a
person
of
importance
in
the
family
)
we
shall
have
witness
enough
for
the
purpose
 
without
include
Mrs.
Merridew
,
if
Mrs.
Merridew
persist
in
sacrifice
herself
to
the
opinion
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
June
23rd
.
 
<EOS>
the
vengeance
of
the
opium
overtook
me
again
last
night
.
<EOS>
no
matter
;
I
must
go
on
with
it
now
till
Monday
be
past
and
go
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
be
not
so
well
again
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
at
two
this
morning
,
he
confess
that
he
open
the
drawer
in
which
his
cigar
be
put
away
.
<EOS>
He
only
succeed
in
lock
it
up
again
by
a
violent
effort
.
<EOS>
His
next
proceeding
,
in
case
of
temptation
,
be
to
throw
the
key
out
of
window
.
<EOS>
the
waiter
bring
it
in
this
morning
,
discover
at
the
bottom
of
an
empty
cistern
 
<EOS>
such
be
Fate
!
<EOS>
I
have
take
possession
of
the
key
until
Tuesday
next
.
  
<EOS>
June
24th
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
<EOS>
and
I
take
a
long
drive
in
an
open
carriage
.
<EOS>
We
both
feel
beneficially
the
blessed
influence
of
the
soft
summer
air
.
<EOS>
I
dine
with
him
at
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
to
my
great
relief
 
for
I
find
him
in
an
over
-
wrought
,
over
-
excite
state
this
morning
 
<EOS>
he
have
two
hour
'
sound
sleep
on
the
sofa
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
another
bad
night
,
now
 
I
be
not
afraid
of
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
June
25th
,
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
of
the
experiment
!
<EOS>
It
be
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
We
have
just
arrive
at
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
and
foremost
question
,
be
the
question
of
Mr.
Blake
's
health
.
  
<EOS>
so
far
as
it
be
possible
for
me
to
judge
,
he
promise
(
physically
speak
)
to
be
quite
as
susceptible
to
the
action
of
the
opium
to
-
night
as
he
be
at
this
time
last
year
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
this
afternoon
,
in
a
state
of
nervous
sensitiveness
which
just
stop
short
of
nervous
irritation
.
<EOS>
He
change
colour
readily
;
his
hand
be
not
quite
steady
;
and
he
start
at
chance
noise
,
and
at
unexpected
appearance
of
person
and
thing
.
  
<EOS>
these
result
have
all
be
produce
by
deprivation
of
sleep
,
which
be
in
its
turn
the
nervous
consequence
of
a
sudden
cessation
in
the
habit
of
smoking
,
after
that
habit
have
be
carry
to
an
extreme
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
same
cause
at
work
again
,
which
operate
last
year
;
and
here
be
,
apparently
,
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
Will
the
parallel
still
hold
good
,
when
the
final
test
have
be
try
?
<EOS>
the
event
of
the
night
must
decide
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
write
these
line
,
Mr.
Blake
be
amuse
himself
at
the
billiard
table
in
the
inner
hall
,
practise
different
stroke
in
the
game
,
as
he
be
accustomed
to
practise
them
when
he
be
a
guest
in
this
house
in
June
last
.
<EOS>
I
have
bring
my
journal
here
,
partly
with
a
view
to
occupy
the
idle
hour
which
I
be
sure
to
have
on
my
hand
between
this
and
to
-
morrow
morning
;
partly
in
the
hope
that
something
may
happen
which
it
may
be
worth
my
while
to
place
on
record
at
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
have
I
omit
anything
,
thus
far
?
<EOS>
a
glance
at
yesterday
's
entry
show
me
that
I
have
forget
to
note
the
arrival
of
the
morning
's
post
.
<EOS>
let
me
set
this
right
before
I
close
these
leave
for
the
present
,
and
join
Mr.
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
I
receive
a
few
line
then
,
yesterday
,
from
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
She
have
arrange
to
travel
by
the
afternoon
train
,
as
I
recommend
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Merridew
have
insist
on
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
the
note
hint
that
the
old
lady
's
generally
excellent
temper
be
a
little
ruffled
,
and
request
all
due
indulgence
for
her
,
in
consideration
of
her
age
and
her
habit
.
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
,
in
my
relation
with
Mrs.
Merridew
,
to
emulate
the
moderation
which
Betteredge
display
in
his
relation
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
receive
us
to
-
day
,
portentously
array
in
his
good
black
suit
,
and
his
stiff
white
cravat
.
<EOS>
whenever
he
look
my
way
,
he
remember
that
I
have
not
read
ROBINSON
crusoe
since
I
be
a
child
,
and
he
respectfully
pity
me
.
  
<EOS>
yesterday
,
also
,
Mr.
Blake
have
the
lawyer
's
answer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
accept
the
invitation
 
under
protest
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
he
think
,
clearly
necessary
that
a
gentleman
possess
of
the
average
allowance
of
common
sense
,
should
accompany
Miss
Verinder
to
the
scene
of
,
what
we
will
venture
to
call
,
the
propose
exhibition
.
<EOS>
for
want
of
a
well
escort
,
Mr.
Bruff
himself
will
be
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
so
here
be
poor
Miss
Verinder
provide
with
two
"
chaperone
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
relief
to
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
world
must
surely
be
satisfied
with
this
!
  
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
hear
of
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
doubt
still
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
expect
to
see
him
to
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
have
just
come
in
,
to
say
that
Mr.
Blake
have
ask
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
lay
down
my
pen
for
the
present
.
     
<EOS>
seven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
be
all
over
the
refurnish
room
and
staircase
again
;
and
we
have
have
a
pleasant
stroll
in
the
shrubbery
,
which
be
Mr.
Blake
's
favourite
walk
when
he
be
here
last
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
,
I
hope
to
revive
the
old
impression
of
place
and
thing
as
vividly
as
possible
in
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
go
to
dine
,
exactly
at
the
hour
at
which
the
birthday
dinner
be
give
last
year
.
<EOS>
My
object
,
of
course
,
be
a
purely
medical
one
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
the
laudanum
must
find
the
process
of
digestion
,
as
nearly
as
may
be
,
where
the
laudanum
find
it
last
year
.
  
<EOS>
at
a
reasonable
time
after
dinner
I
propose
to
lead
the
conversation
back
again
 
as
inartificially
as
I
can
 
to
the
subject
of
the
Diamond
,
and
of
the
indian
conspiracy
to
steal
it
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
fill
his
mind
with
these
topic
,
I
shall
have
do
all
that
it
be
in
my
power
to
do
,
before
the
time
come
for
give
him
the
second
dose
.
     
<EOS>
half
-
past
eight
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
this
moment
find
an
opportunity
of
attend
to
the
most
important
duty
of
all
;
the
duty
of
look
in
the
family
medicine
chest
,
for
the
laudanum
which
Mr.
Candy
use
last
year
.
  
<EOS>
ten
minute
since
,
I
catch
Betteredge
at
an
unoccupied
moment
,
and
tell
him
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
without
a
word
of
objection
,
without
so
much
as
an
attempt
to
produce
his
pocket
-
book
,
he
lead
the
way
(
make
allowance
for
me
at
every
step
)
to
the
store
-
room
in
which
the
medicine
chest
be
keep
.
  
<EOS>
I
discover
the
bottle
,
carefully
guard
by
a
glass
stopper
tie
over
with
leather
.
<EOS>
the
preparation
which
it
contain
be
,
as
I
have
anticipate
,
the
common
Tincture
of
Opium
.
<EOS>
find
the
bottle
still
well
fill
,
I
have
resolve
to
use
it
,
in
preference
to
employ
either
of
the
two
preparation
with
which
I
have
take
care
to
provide
myself
,
in
case
of
emergency
.
  
<EOS>
the
question
of
the
quantity
which
I
be
to
administer
present
certain
difficulty
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
it
over
,
and
have
decide
on
increase
the
dose
.
  
<EOS>
My
note
inform
me
that
Mr.
Candy
only
administer
twenty
-
five
minim
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
small
dose
to
have
produce
the
result
which
follow
 
even
in
the
case
of
a
person
so
sensitive
as
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
highly
probable
that
Mr.
Candy
give
more
than
he
suppose
himself
to
have
give
 
knowing
,
as
I
do
,
that
he
have
a
keen
relish
of
the
pleasure
of
the
table
,
and
that
he
measure
out
the
laudanum
on
the
birthday
,
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
in
any
case
,
I
shall
run
the
risk
of
enlarge
the
dose
to
forty
minim
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
Mr.
Blake
know
beforehand
that
he
be
go
to
take
the
laudanum
 
which
be
equivalent
,
physiologically
speak
,
to
his
have
(
unconsciously
to
himself
)
<EOS>
a
certain
capacity
in
him
to
resist
the
effect
.
<EOS>
if
my
view
be
right
,
a
large
quantity
be
therefore
imperatively
require
,
this
time
,
to
repeat
the
result
which
the
small
quantity
produce
,
last
year
.
     
<EOS>
ten
o'clock

<EOS>

hour
since

<EOS>
a
little
before
nine
o'clock

I
prevail
on
Mr.
Blake
to
accompany
me
to
his
bedroom
;
stating
,
as
a
reason
,
that
I
wish
him
to
look
round
it
,
for
the
last
time
,
in
order
to
make
quite
sure
that
nothing
have
be
forget
in
the
refurnishing
of
the
room

<EOS>
I
have
previously
arrange
with
Betteredge

five

plainly
enough
out
of
Mr.
Bruff

<EOS>
be
well
used
to
produce
this
effect
on
stranger

I
do
not

a
moment
in

what
I
want
to

,
before
the
lawyer
find
his
way
into
Mr.
Blake

<EOS>

I
bow
,
and
leave
Betteredge
to
show
him
to

It

<EOS>
We

upon

take

apology
,
the
lawyer
have
go
back
to
his
own
room
,
and
have
immerse
himself
obstinately
in
his
black
bag
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
of
Mrs.
Merridew
and
her
embroidery
,
and
of
Betteredge
and
his
conscience
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
wonderful
sameness
in
the
solid
side
of
the
english
character
 
just
as
there
be
a
wonderful
sameness
in
the
solid
expression
of
the
english
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
be
you
go
to
give
me
the
laudanum
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Mr.
Blake
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
wait
a
little
longer
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
stay
and
keep
you
company
till
the
time
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
then
not
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
inquiry
which
I
have
make
,
at
various
time
,
of
Betteredge
and
Mr.
Blake
,
have
lead
me
to
the
conclusion
that
the
dose
of
laudanum
give
by
Mr.
Candy
could
not
possibly
have
be
administer
before
eleven
.
<EOS>
I
have
accordingly
determine
not
to
try
the
second
dose
until
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
We
talk
a
little
;
but
both
our
mind
be
preoccupy
by
the
come
ordeal
.
<EOS>
the
conversation
soon
flag
 
then
drop
altogether
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
idly
turn
over
the
book
on
his
bedroom
table
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
the
precaution
of
look
at
them
,
when
we
first
enter
the
room

all
(

immeasurably
superior
to
anything
produce
in

and
all
(
from
my
present
point
of
view
)
possess
the
one
great
merit
of
enchain
nobody

interest
,
and
excite
nobody

<EOS>
I
leave
Mr.
Blake
to
the
composing
influence
of
Standard
Literature
,
and
occupy
myself
in
make
this
entry
in
my

<EOS>
My

inform
me
that
it

two
o'clock
A.M.
 
<EOS>
the

have
be
try

<EOS>
with
what
result
,
I
be
now
to
describe

<EOS>
at
eleven
o'clock

I
ring
the
bell
for
Betteredge
,
and
tell
Mr.
Blake
that
he
may
at
last
prepare
himself
for
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
out
of
the
window
at
the
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
mild
and
rainy
,
resemble
,
in
this
respect
,
the
night
of
the
birthday
 
<EOS>
the
twenty
-
first
of
June
,
last
year
.
<EOS>
without
profess
to
believe
in
omen
,
it
be
at
least
encouraging
to
find
no
direct
nervous
influence
 
no
stormy
or
electric
perturbation
 
in
the
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
join
me
at
the
window
,
and
mysteriously
put
a
little
slip
of
paper
into
my
hand
.
<EOS>
It
contain
these
line
:
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Merridew
have
go
to

on
the
distinct
understanding
that

morning
,
and
that
I
be
not
to
stir
out
of
this

house
until

set
me
free

<EOS>
She
have
no
idea

scene
of

she
would
have
remain
in
it
for

<EOS>
I
be
alone
,
and
very
anxious
.
<EOS>
pray
let
me
see
you
measure
out
the

I
want
to
have
something

<EOS>
I
follow
Betteredge
out
of

tell
him
to
remove
the

<EOS>
the
order
appear
to
take
him
completely
by

<EOS>
He
look
as
if
he
suspect
me

occult
medical
design

may
I
presume
to
ask

Betteredge

effectually

occasion

I
go

Mr.

address

speak
from

with
that
reply
he
follow

answer
fervently

<EOS>
one
look

that
I
could
trust

"
I

He
get
up
with
a
start
 
as
if
I
have
disturb
him
at
a
particularly
interesting
place
 
and
follow
me
to
the
medicine
-
chest
.
<EOS>
there
,
deprive
of
the
breathless
excitement
incidental
to
the
practice
of
his
profession

he
look
at
Betteredge
 
and
yawn
wearily

<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
join
me
with
a
glass
jug
of
cold
water

which
she
have
take
from

side

table

<EOS>
"

she
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
I

"
  
<EOS>
I
measure
out
the
forty
minim
from

pour
the
laudanum

medicine
glass

fill
it

it
be
three
part
full

I
say
,
and
hand
the
glass
to
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
I
then
direct
Betteredge
to
lock
up
the
medicine
chest
;
inform
him
that
I
have
do
with
it
now

<EOS>
a
look
of
unutterable
relief
overspread
the
old
servant
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
have
evidently
suspect
me
of
a
medical
design
on
his
young
lady
!
  
<EOS>
after
add
the
water
as
I
have
direct
,
Miss

seize
a
moment
 
while

be
lock
the
chest

while
Mr.

be
look
back
to
his
paper

slyly
kiss
the
rim
of
the
medicine
glass
.
<EOS>
"
when
you
give
it
to
him
,
"
say
the
charming
girl
,
"
give
it
to
him
on
that
side
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
take
the
piece
of
crystal
which
be
to
represent
the
Diamond
from
my
pocket
,
and
give
it
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
a
hand
in
this

too

I
say

"
You

put
it
where
you
put
the
Moonstone
last

<EOS>
She
lead
the
way
to
the
indian
cabinet
,
and
put
the
mock
Diamond
into
the
drawer
which
the
real
Diamond
have
occupy
on
the
birthday
night
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
witness
this
proceeding
,
under
protest
,
as
he
have
witness
everything
else
.
<EOS>
but
the
strong
dramatic
interest
which
the
experiment
be
now
assume
,
prove
(
to
my
great
amusement
)
to
be
too
much
for
Betteredge
's
capacity
of
self
restraint
.
<EOS>
His
hand
tremble
as
he
hold
the
candle
,
and
he
whisper
anxiously
,
"
be
you
sure
,
miss
<EOS>
,
it
be
the
right
drawer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
lead
the
way
out
again
,
with
the
laudanum
and
water
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
at
the
door
,
I
stop
to
address
a
last
word
to
Miss
Verinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
long
in
put
out
the
light
,
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
put
them
out
at
once
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
will
wait
in
my
bedroom
,
with
only
one
candle
alight
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
close
the
sit
-
room
door
behind
us
.
<EOS>
follow
by
Mr.
Bruff
and
Betteredge
,
I
go
back
to
Mr.
Blake
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
We
find
him
move
restlessly
from
side
to
side
of
the
bed
,
and
wonder
irritably
whether
he
be
to
have
the
laudanum
that
night
.
<EOS>
in
the
presence
of
the
two
witness
,
I
give
him
the
dose
,
and
shake
up
his
pillow
,
and
tell
him
to
lie
down
again
quietly
and
wait
.
  
<EOS>
His
bed
,
provide
with
light
chintz
curtain
,
be
place
,
with
the
head
against
the
wall
of
the
room
,
so
as
to
leave
a
good
open
space
on
either
side
of
it
.
<EOS>
on
one
side
,
I
draw
the
curtain
completely
 
and
in
the
part
of
the
room
thus
screen
from
his
view
,
I
place
Mr.
Bruff
and
Betteredge
,
to
wait
for
the
result
.
<EOS>
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
I
half
draw
the
curtain
 
and
place
my
own
chair
at
a
little
distance
,
so
that
I
may
let
him
see
me
or
not
see
me
,
speak
to
me
or
not
speak
to
me
,
just
as
the
circumstance
may
direct
.
<EOS>
have
already
be
inform
that
he
always
sleep
with
a
light
in
the
room
,
I
place
one
of
the
two
light
candle
on
a
little
table
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
where
the
glare
of
the
light
would
not
strike
on
his
eye
.
<EOS>
the
other
candle
I
give
to
Mr.
Bruff
;
the
light
,
in
this
instance
,
be
subdue
by
the
screen
of
the
chintz
curtain
.
<EOS>
the
window
be
open
at
the
top
,
so
as
to
ventilate
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
rain
fall
softly
,
the
house
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
It
be
twenty
minute
past
eleven
,
by
my
watch
,
when
the
preparation
be
complete
,
and
I
take
my
place
on
the
chair
set
apart
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
resume
his
paper
,
with
every
appearance
of
be
as
deeply
interested
in
them
as
ever
.
<EOS>
but
look
towards
him
now
,
I
see
certain
sign
and
token
which
tell
me
that
the
Law
be
begin
to
lose
its
hold
on
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
the
suspended
interest
of
the
situation
in
which
we
be
now
place
be
slowly
assert
its
influence
even
on
his
unimaginative
mind
.
<EOS>
as
for
Betteredge
,
consistency
of
principle
and
dignity
of
conduct
have
become
,
in
his
case
,
mere
empty
word
.
<EOS>
He
forget
that
I
be
perform
a
conjuring
trick
on
Mr.
Franklin
Blake
;
he
forget
that
I
have
upset
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
;
he
forget
that
I
have
not
read
ROBINSON
crusoe
since
I
be
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
the
Lord
's
sake
,
sir
,
"
he
whisper
to
me
,
"
tell
us
when
it
will
begin
to
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
before
midnight
,
"
I
whisper
back
.
<EOS>
"
say
nothing
,
and
sit
still
.
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
drop
to
the
low
depth
of
familiarity
with
me
,
without
a
struggle
to
save
himself
.
<EOS>
He
answer
by
a
wink
!
  
<EOS>
look
next
towards
Mr.
Blake
<EOS>
,
I
find
him
as
restless
as
ever
in
his
bed
;
fretfully
wonder
why
the
influence
of
the
laudanum
have
not
begin
to
assert
itself
yet
.
<EOS>
to
tell
him
,
in
his
present
humour
,
that
the
more
he
fidget
and
wonder
,
the
longer
he
would
delay
the
result
for
which
we
be
now
wait
,
would
have
be
simply
useless
.
<EOS>
the
wise
course
to
take
be
to
dismiss
the
idea
of
the
opium
from
his
mind
,
by
lead
him
insensibly
to
think
of
something
else
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
I
encourage
him
to
talk
to
me
;
contrive
so
to
direct
the
conversation
,
on
my
side
,
as
to
lead
it
back
again
to
the
subject
which
have
engage
us
earlier
in
the
evening
 
<EOS>
the
subject
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
I
take
care
to
revert
to
those
portion
of
the
story
of
the
Moonstone
,
which
relate
to
the
transport
of
it
from
London
to
Yorkshire
;
to
the
risk
which
Mr.
Blake
have
run
in
remove
it
from
the
bank
at
Frizinghall
:
and
to
the
unexpected
appearance
of
the
Indians
at
the
house
,
on
the
evening
of
the
birthday
.
<EOS>
and
I
purposely
assume
,
in
refer
to
these
event
,
to
have
misunderstood
much
of
what
Mr.
Blake
himself
have
tell
me
a
few
hour
since
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
,
I
set
him
talk
on
the
subject
with
which
it
be
now
vitally
important
to
fill
his
mind
 
without
allow
him
to
suspect
that
I
be
make
him
talk
for
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
little
by
little
,
he
become
so
interested
in
put
me
right
that
he
forget
to
fidget
in
the
bed
.
<EOS>
His
mind
be
far
away
from
the
question
of
the
opium
,
at
the
all
-
important
time
when
his
eye
first
tell
me
that
the
opium
be
begin
to
lay
its
hold
on
his
brain
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
at
my
watch
.
<EOS>
It
want
five
minute
to
twelve
,
when
the
premonitory
symptom
of
the
working
of
the
laudanum
first
show
themselves
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
time
,
no
unpractised
eye
would
have
detect
any
change
in
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
minute
of
the
new
morning
wear
away
,
the
swiftly
-
subtle
progress
of
the
influence
begin
to
show
itself
more
plainly
.
<EOS>
the
sublime
intoxication
of
opium
gleam
in
his
eye
;
the
dew
of
a
stealthy
perspiration
begin
to
glisten
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
in
five
minute
more
,
the
talk
which
he
still
keep
up
with
me
,
fail
in
coherence
.
<EOS>
He
hold
steadily
to
the
subject
of
the
Diamond
;
but
he
cease
to
complete
his
sentence
.
<EOS>
a
little
later
,
the
sentence
drop
to
single
word
.
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
an
interval
of
silence
.
<EOS>
then
,
he
sit
up
in
bed
.
<EOS>
then
,
still
busy
with
the
subject
of
the
Diamond
,
he
begin
to
talk
again
 
not
to
me
,
but
to
himself
.
<EOS>
that
change
tell
me
that
the
first
stage
in
the
experiment
be
reach
.
<EOS>
the
stimulant
influence
of
the
opium
have
get
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
time
,
now
,
be
twenty
-
three
minute
past
twelve
.
<EOS>
the
next
half
hour
,
at
most
,
would
decide
the
question
of
whether
he
would
,
or
would
not
,
get
up
from
his
bed
,
and
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
breathless
interest
of
watch
him
 
in
the
unutterable
triumph
of
see
the
first
result
of
the
experiment
declare
itself
in
the
manner
,
and
nearly
at
the
time
,
which
I
have
anticipate
 
I
have
utterly
forget
the
two
companion
of
my
night
vigil
.
<EOS>
look
towards
them
now
,
I
see
the
Law
(
as
represent
by
Mr.
Bruff
's
paper
)
lie
unheeded
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
himself
be
look
eagerly
through
a
crevice
leave
in
the
imperfectly
-
draw
curtain
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
and
Betteredge
,
oblivious
of
all
respect
for
social
distinction
,
be
peep
over
Mr.
Bruff
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
They
both
start
back
,
on
find
that
I
be
look
at
them
,
like
two
boy
catch
out
by
their
schoolmaster
in
a
fault
.
<EOS>
I
sign
to
them
to
take
off
their
boot
quietly
,
as
I
be
take
off
mine
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Blake
give
us
the
chance
of
follow
him
,
it
be
vitally
necessary
to
follow
him
without
noise
.
  
<EOS>
ten
minute
pass
 
and
nothing
happen
.
<EOS>
then
,
he
suddenly
throw
the
bed
-
clothe
off
him
.
<EOS>
He
put
one
leg
out
of
bed
.
<EOS>
He
wait
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
have
never
take
it
out
of
the
bank
,
"
he
say
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
safe
in
the
bank
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
heart
throb
fast
;
the
pulse
at
my
temple
beat
furiously
.
<EOS>
the
doubt
about
the
safety
of
the
Diamond
be
,
once
more
,
the
dominant
impression
in
his
brain
!
<EOS>
on
that
one
pivot
,
the
whole
success
of
the
experiment
turn
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
thus
suddenly
open
before
me
be
too
much
for
my
shatter
nerve
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
look
away
from
him
 
<EOS>
or
I
should
have
lose
my
self
-
control
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
another
interval
of
silence
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
could
trust
myself
to
look
back
at
him
<EOS>
he
be
out
of
his
bed
,
stand
erect
at
the
side
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
pupil
of
his
eye
be
now
contract
;
his
eyeball
gleam
in
the
light
of
the
candle
as
he
move
his
head
slowly
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
He
be
think
;
he
be
doubt
 
he
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
I
know
?
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
the
Indians
may
be
hide
in
the
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stop
,
and
walk
slowly
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
turn
 
wait
 
come
back
to
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
even
lock
up
,
"
he
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
in
the
drawer
of
her
cabinet
.
<EOS>
and
the
drawer
do
not
lock
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
sit
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
anybody
may
take
it
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
He
rise
again
restlessly
,
and
reiterate
his
first
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
I
know
?
<EOS>
the
Indians
may
be
hide
in
the
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
wait
again
.
<EOS>
I
draw
back
behind
the
half
curtain
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
He
look
about
the
room
,
with
a
vacant
glitter
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
breathless
moment
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
of
some
sort
.
<EOS>
a
pause
in
the
action
of
the
opium
?
<EOS>
a
pause
in
the
action
of
the
brain
?
<EOS>
who
could
tell
?
<EOS>
everything
depend
,
now
,
on
what
he
do
next
.
  
<EOS>
He
lay
himself
down
again
on
the
bed
!
  
<EOS>
a
horrible
doubt
cross
my
mind
.
<EOS>
be
it
possible
that
the
sedative
action
of
the
opium
be
make
itself
feel
already
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
my
experience
that
it
should
do
this
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
experience
,
where
opium
be
concern
?
<EOS>
there
be
probably
no
two
man
in
existence
on
whom
the
drug
act
in
exactly
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
be
some
constitutional
peculiarity
in
him
,
feel
the
influence
in
some
new
way
?
<EOS>
be
we
to
fail
on
the
very
brink
of
success
?
  
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
He
get
up
again
abruptly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
the
devil
be
I
to
sleep
,
"
he
say
,
"
with
this
on
my
mind
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
the
light
,
burn
on
the
table
at
the
head
of
his
bed
.
<EOS>
after
a
moment
,
he
take
the
candle
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
blow
out
the
second
candle
,
burn
behind
the
closed
curtain
.
<EOS>
I
draw
back
,
with
Mr.
Bruff
and
Betteredge
,
into
the
farth
corner
by
the
bed
.
<EOS>
I
sign
to
them
to
be
silent
,
as
if
their
life
have
depend
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
wait
 
see
and
hear
nothing
.
<EOS>
We
wait
,
hide
from
him
by
the
curtain
.
  
<EOS>
the
light
which
he
be
hold
on
the
other
side
of
us
move
suddenly
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
he
pass
us
,
swift
and
noiseless
,
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
He
open
the
bedroom
door
,
and
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
We
follow
him
along
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
We
follow
him
down
the
stair
.
<EOS>
We
follow
him
along
the
second
corridor
.
<EOS>
He
never
look
back
;
he
never
hesitate
.
  
<EOS>
He
open
the
sit
-
room
door
,
and
go
in
,
leave
it
open
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
be
hang
(
like
all
the
other
door
in
the
house
)
on
large
old
-
fashioned
hinge
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
open
,
a
crevice
be
open
between
the
door
and
the
post
.
<EOS>
I
sign
to
my
two
companion
to
look
through
this
,
so
as
to
keep
them
from
show
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
place
myself
 
outside
the
door
also
 
on
the
opposite
side
.
<EOS>
a
recess
in
the
wall
be
at
my
left
hand
,
in
which
I
could
instantly
hide
myself
,
if
he
show
any
sign
of
look
back
into
the
corridor
.
  
<EOS>
He
advance
to
the
middle
of
the
room
,
with
the
candle
still
in
his
hand
:
he
look
about
him
 
but
he
never
look
back
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
the
door
of
Miss
Verinder
's
bedroom
,
stand
ajar
.
<EOS>
She
have
put
out
her
light
.
<EOS>
She
control
herself
nobly
.
<EOS>
the
dim
white
outline
of
her
summer
dress
be
all
that
I
could
see
.
<EOS>
nobody
who
have
not
know
it
beforehand
would
have
suspect
that
there
be
a
live
creature
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
keep
back
,
in
the
dark
:
not
a
word
,
not
a
movement
escape
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
ten
minute
past
one
.
<EOS>
I
hear
,
through
the
dead
silence
,
the
soft
drip
of
the
rain
and
the
tremulous
passage
of
the
night
air
through
the
tree
.
  
<EOS>
after
wait
irresolute
,
for
a
minute
or
more
,
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
he
move
to
the
corner
near
the
window
,
where
the
indian
cabinet
stand
.
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
candle
on
the
top
of
the
cabinet
.
<EOS>
He
open
,
and
shut
,
one
drawer
after
another
,
until
he
come
to
the
drawer
in
which
the
mock
Diamond
be
put
.
<EOS>
He
look
into
the
drawer
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
then
he
take
the
mock
Diamond
out
with
his
right
hand
.
<EOS>
with
the
other
hand
,
he
take
the
candle
from
the
top
of
the
cabinet
.
  
<EOS>
He
walk
back
a
few
step
towards
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
stand
still
again
.
  
<EOS>
thus
far
,
he
have
exactly
repeat
what
he
have
do
on
the
birthday
night
.
<EOS>
Would
his
next
proceeding
be
the
same
as
the
proceeding
of
last
year
?
<EOS>
Would
he
leave
the
room
?
<EOS>
Would
he
go
back
now
,
as
I
believe
he
have
go
back
then
,
to
his
bed
-
chamber
?
<EOS>
Would
he
show
us
what
he
have
do
with
the
Diamond
,
when
he
have
return
to
his
own
room
?
  
<EOS>
His
first
action
,
when
he
move
once
more
,
prove
to
be
an
action
which
he
have
not
perform
,
when
he
be
under
the
influence
of
the
opium
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
candle
down
on
a
table
,
and
wander
on
a
little
towards
the
farther
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
sofa
there
.
<EOS>
He
lean
heavily
on
the
back
of
it
,
with
his
left
hand
 
then
rouse
himself
,
and
return
to
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
could
now
see
his
eye
.
<EOS>
They
be
get
dull
and
heavy
;
the
glitter
in
them
be
fast
die
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
suspense
of
the
moment
prove
too
much
for
Miss
Verinder
's
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
She
advance
a
few
step
 
then
stop
again
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
and
Betteredge
look
across
the
open
doorway
at
me
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
the
prevision
of
a
come
disappointment
be
impress
itself
on
their
mind
as
well
as
on
mine
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
so
long
as
he
stand
where
he
be
,
there
be
hope
.
<EOS>
We
wait
,
in
unutterable
expectation
,
to
see
what
would
happen
next
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
event
be
decisive
.
<EOS>
He
let
the
mock
Diamond
drop
out
of
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
It
fall
on
the
floor
,
before
the
doorway
 
plainly
visible
to
him
,
and
to
everyone
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
effort
to
pick
it
up
:
he
look
down
at
it
vacantly
,
and
,
as
he
look
,
his
head
sink
on
his
breast
.
<EOS>
He
stagger
 
rouse
himself
for
an
instant
 
walk
back
unsteadily
to
the
sofa
 
and
sit
down
on
it
.
<EOS>
He
make
a
last
effort
;
he
try
to
rise
,
and
sink
back
.
<EOS>
His
head
fall
on
the
sofa
cushion
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
twenty
-
five
minute
past
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
before
I
have
put
my
watch
back
in
my
pocket
,
he
be
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
the
sedative
influence
have
get
him
;
the
experiment
be
at
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
I
enter
the
room
,
tell
Mr.
Bruff
and
Betteredge
that
they
may
follow
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
fear
of
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
We
be
free
to
move
and
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
first
thing
to
settle
,
"
I
say
,
"
be
the
question
of
what
we
be
to
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
probably
sleep
for
the
next
six
or
seven
hour
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
distance
to
carry
him
back
to
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
young
,
I
could
have
do
it
alone
.
<EOS>
but
my
health
and
strength
be
not
what
they
be
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
must
ask
you
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
before
they
could
answer
,
Miss
Verinder
call
to
me
softly
.
<EOS>
She
meet
me
at
the
door
of
her
room
,
with
a
light
shawl
,
and
with
the
counterpane
from
her
own
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
to
watch
him
while
he
sleep
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
not
sure
enough
of
the
action
of
the
opium
in
his
case
to
be
willing
to
leave
him
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
hand
me
the
shawl
and
the
counterpane
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
disturb
him
?
"
<EOS>
she
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
make
his
bed
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
I
can
shut
my
door
,
and
keep
in
my
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
infinitely
the
simple
and
the
safe
way
of
dispose
of
him
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
I
mention
the
suggestion
to
Mr.
Bruff
and
Betteredge
 
who
both
approve
of
my
adopt
it
.
<EOS>
in
five
minute
I
have
lay
him
comfortably
on
the
sofa
,
and
have
cover
him
lightly
with
the
counterpane
and
the
shawl
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
wish
us
good
night
,
and
close
the
door
.
<EOS>
at
my
request
,
we
three
then
draw
round
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
on
which
the
candle
be
still
burn
,
and
on
which
writing
material
be
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
before
we
separate
,
"
I
begin
,
"
I
have
a
word
to
say
about
the
experiment
which
have
be
try
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
two
distinct
object
be
to
be
gain
by
it
.
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
object
be
to
prove
,
that
Mr.
Blake
enter
this
room
,
and
take
the
Diamond
,
last
year
,
act
unconsciously
and
irresponsibly
,
under
the
influence
of
opium
.
<EOS>
after
what
you
have
both
see
,
be
you
both
satisfied
,
so
far
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
answer
me
in
the
affirmative
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
second
object
,
"
I
go
on
,
"
be
to
discover
what
he
do
with
the
Diamond
,
after
he
be
see
by
Miss
Verinder
to
leave
her
sitting
-
room
with
the
jewel
in
his
hand
,
on
the
birthday
night
.
<EOS>
the
gaining
of
this
object
depend
,
of
course
,
on
his
still
continue
exactly
to
repeat
his
proceeding
of
last
year
.
<EOS>
He
have
fail
to
do
that
;
and
the
purpose
of
the
experiment
be
defeat
accordingly
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
assert
that
I
be
not
disappoint
at
the
result
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
honestly
say
that
I
be
not
surprise
by
it
.
<EOS>
I
tell
Mr.
Blake
from
the
first
,
that
our
complete
success
in
this
matter
depend
on
our
completely
reproduce
in
him
the
physical
and
moral
condition
of
last
year
 
and
I
warn
him
that
this
be
the
next
thing
to
a
downright
impossibility
.
<EOS>
We
have
only
partially
reproduce
the
condition
,
and
the
experiment
have
be
only
partially
successful
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
possible
that
I
may
have
administer
too
large
a
dose
of
laudanum
.
<EOS>
but
I
myself
look
upon
the
first
reason
that
I
have
give
,
as
the
true
reason
why
we
have
to
lament
a
failure
,
as
well
as
to
rejoice
over
a
success
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
say
those
word
,
I
put
the
writing
material
before
Mr.
Bruff
,
and
ask
him
if
he
have
any
objection
 
before
we
separate
for
the
night
 
to
draw
out
,
and
sign
,
a
plain
statement
of
what
he
have
see
.
<EOS>
He
at
once
take
the
pen
,
and
produce
the
statement
with
the
fluent
readiness
of
a
practised
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
owe
you
this
,
"
he
say
,
sign
the
paper
,
"
as
some
atonement
for
what
pass
between
us
earlier
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
for
have
doubt
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
do
Franklin
Blake
an
inestimable
service
.
<EOS>
in
our
legal
phrase
,
you
have
prove
your
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Betteredge
's
apology
be
characteristic
of
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Jennings
,
"
he
say
,
"
when
you
read
ROBINSON
CRUSOE
again
(
which
I
strongly
recommend
you
to
do
)
,
you
will
find
that
he
never
scruple
to
acknowledge
it
,
when
he
turn
out
to
have
be
in
the
wrong

<EOS>
please
to
consider
me
,
sir
,
as
do
what
Robinson
Crusoe
do
,
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
with
those
word
he
sign
the
paper
in
his
turn
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
take
me
aside
,
as
we
rise
from
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
word
about
the
Diamond
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
Your
theory
be
that
Franklin
Blake
hide
the
Moonstone
in
his
room
.
<EOS>
My
theory
be
,
that
the
Moonstone
be
in
the
possession
of
Mr.
Luker
's
banker
in
London
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
dispute
which
of
us
be
right
.
<EOS>
We
will
only
ask
,
which
of
us
be
in
a
position
to
put
his
theory
to
the
test
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
test
,
in
my
case
,
"
I
answer
,
"
have
be
try
to
-
night
,
and
have
fail
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
test
,
in
my
case
,
"
rejoin
Mr.
Bruff
,
"
be
still
in
process
of
trial
.
<EOS>
for
the
last
two
day
I
have
have
a
watch
set
for
Mr.
Luker
at
the
bank
;
and
I
shall
cause
that
watch
to
be
continue
until
the
last
day
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
he
must
take
the
Diamond
himself
out
of
his
banker
'
hand
 
and
I
be
act
on
the
chance
that
the
person
who
have
pledge
the
Diamond
may
force
him
to
do
this
by
redeem
the
pledge
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
I
may
be
able
to
lay
my
hand
on
the
person
.
<EOS>
if
I
succeed
,
I
clear
up
the
mystery
,
exactly
at
the
point
where
the
mystery
baffle
us
now
!
<EOS>
do
you
admit
that
,
so
far
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
admit
it
readily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
back
to
town
by
the
morning
train
,

pursue
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
hear
,
when
I
return
,
that
a
discovery
have
be
make
 
and
it
may
be
of
the
great
importance
that
I
should
have
Franklin
Blake
at
hand
to
appeal
to
,
if
necessary

<EOS>
I
intend
to
tell
him
,
as
soon
as
he
wake
,
that
he
must
return
with
me
to
London
.
<EOS>
after
all
that
have
happen
,
may
I
trust
to
your
influence
to
back
me
?
"
  
"
certainly
!
"
<EOS>
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
shake
hand
with
me
,
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
Betteredge
follow
him
out
;
I
go
to
the
sofa
to
look
at
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
move
since
I
have
lay
him
down
and
make
his
bed
 
<EOS>
he
lie
lock
in
a
deep
and
quiet
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
still
look
at
him
,
I
hear
the
bedroom
door
softly
open
.
<EOS>
once
more
,
Miss
Verinder
appear
on
the
threshold
,
in
her
pretty
summer
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
me
a
last
favour
?
"
she
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
watch
him
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
hesitate
 
not
in
the
interest
of
propriety
;
only
in
the
interest
of
her
night
's
rest
.
<EOS>
She
come
close
to
me
,
and
take
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
sleep
;
I
can
not
even
sit
still
,
in
my
own
room
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Jennings
,
if
you
be
me
,
only
think
how
you
would
long
to
sit
and
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
say
,
yes
!
<EOS>
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
be
it
necessary
to
mention
that
I
give
way
?
<EOS>
surely
not
!
  
<EOS>
She
draw
a
chair
to
the
foot
of
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
in
a
silent
ecstasy
of
happiness
,
till
the
tear
rise
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
She
dry
her
eye
,
and
say
she
would
fetch
her
work
.
<EOS>
She
fetch
her
work
,
and
never
do
a
single
stitch
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
lie
in
her
lap
 
<EOS>
she
be
not
even
able
to
look
away
from
him
long
enough
to
thread
her
needle
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
my
own
youth
;
I
think
of
the
gentle
eye
which
have
once
look
love
at
me
.
<EOS>
in
the
heaviness
of
my
heart
I
turn
to
my
Journal
for
relief
,
and
write
in
it
what
be
write
here
.
  
<EOS>
so
we
keep
our
watch
together
in
silence
.
<EOS>
one
of
us
absorb
in
his
writing
;
the
other
absorbed
in
her
love
.
  
<EOS>
hour
after
hour
he
lie
in
his
deep
sleep
.
<EOS>
the
light
of
the
new
day
grow
and
grow
in
the
room
,
and
still
he
never
move
.
  
<EOS>
towards
six
o'clock
,
I
feel
the
warning
which
tell
me
that
my
pain
be
come
back
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
leave
her
alone
with
him
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
I
say
I
would
go
up
-
stair
,
and
fetch
another
pillow
for
him
out
of
his
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
long
attack
,
this
time
.
<EOS>
in
a
little
while
I
be
able
to
venture
back
,
and
let
her
see
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
her
at
the
head
of
the
sofa
,
when
I
return
.
<EOS>
She
be
just
touch
his
forehead
with
her
lip
.
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
as
soberly
as
I
could
,
and
point
to
her
chair
.
<EOS>
She
look
back
at
me
with
a
bright
smile
,
and
a
charming
colour
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
do
it
,
"
she
whisper
,
"
in
my
place
!
"
     
<EOS>
It
be
just
eight
o'clock

<EOS>
He

to
move
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
be

by
the
side
of
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
have
so
place
herself
that
when
his
eye
first
open
,
they
must
open
on
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
Shall
I
leave
them
together
?
  
<EOS>
yes
!
     
<EOS>
eleven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
the
house

empty
again
.
<EOS>
They
have
arrange
it
among
themselves
;
they
have
all
go
to
London
by
the
ten
o'clock
train
.
<EOS>
My
brief
dream
of
happiness
be
over
.
<EOS>
I
have
awaken
again
to
the
reality
of
my
friendless
and
lonely
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
dare
not
trust
myself
to
write
down
,
the
kind
word
that
have
be
say
to
me
especially
by
Miss
Verinder
and
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
needless
.
<EOS>
those
word
will
come
back
to
me
in
my
solitary
hour
,
and
will
help
me
through
what
be
leave
of
the
end
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Blake
be
to
write
,
and
tell
me
what
happen
in
London

<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
be

the
autumn
(
for
her
marriage

no

)
;
and
I

My

the
dreadful
alternative
between
the
opium

<EOS>
God

His

<EOS>
I
have

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
the
Story
resume
by
FRANKLIN
BLAKE
   
<EOS>
but
few
word
be
need
,
on
my
part
,
to
complete
the
narrative
that
have
be
present
in
the
Journal
of
Ezra
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
of
myself
,
I
have
only
to
say
that
I
awake
on
the
morning
of
the
twenty
-
sixth
,
perfectly
ignorant
of
all
that
I
have
say
and
do
under
the
influence
of
the
opium
 
from
the
time
when
the
drug
first
lay
its
hold
on
me
,
to
the
time
when
I
open
my
eye
,
in
Rachel
's
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
of
what
happen
after
my
waking
,
I
do
not
feel
call
upon
to
render
an
account
in
detail
.
<EOS>
confine
myself
merely
to
result
,
I
have
to
report
that
Rachel
and
I
thoroughly
understand
each
other
,
before
a
single
word
of
explanation
have
pass
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
I
decline
to
account
,
and
Rachel
decline
to
account
,
for
the
extraordinary
rapidity
of
our
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
Sir
and
Madam
,
look
back
at
the
time
when
you
be
passionately
attach
to
each
other
 
and
you
will
know
what
happen
,
after
Ezra
Jennings
have
shut
the
door
of
the
sitting
-
room
,
as
well
as
I
know
it
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
however
,
no
objection
to
add
,
that
we
should
have
be
certainly
discover
by
Mrs.
Merridew
,
but
for
Rachel
's
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
She
hear
the
sound
of
the
old
lady
's
dress
in
the
corridor
,
and
instantly
run
out
to
meet
her
;
I
hear
Mrs.
Merridew
say
,
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
and
I
hear
Rachel
answer
,
"
the
explosion

"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Merridew
instantly
permit
herself
to
be
take
by
the
arm
,
and
lead
into
the
garden
,
out
of
the
way
of
the
impending
shock
.
<EOS>
on
her
return
to

express
herself
as

the
vast
improvement

Science

since
the
time

"
explosion
,
Mr.
Blake
,
be
infinitely
mild
than
they
be
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
I
barely
hear
Mr.
Jennings
's
explosion
from
the
garden
.
<EOS>
and
no
smell
afterwards
,
that
I
can
detect
,
now
we
have
come
back
to
the
house
!
<EOS>
I
must
really
apologise
to
your
medical
friend
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
due
to
him
to
say
that
he
have
manage
it
beautifully
!
"
  
<EOS>
so
,
after
vanquish
Betteredge
and
Mr.
Bruff
,
Ezra
Jennings
vanquish
Mrs.
Merridew
herself
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
of
undeveloped
liberal
feeling
in
the
world
,
after
all
!
  
<EOS>
at
breakfast
,
Mr.
Bruff
make
no
secret
of
his
reason
for
wish
that
I
should
accompany
him
to
London
by
the
morning
train
.
<EOS>
the
watch
keep
at
the
bank
,
and
the
result
which
may
yet
come
of
it
,
appeal
so
irresistibly
to
Rachel
's
curiosity
,
that
she
at
once
decide
(
if
Mrs.
Merridew
have
no
objection
)
on
accompany
us
back
to
town
 
so
as
to
be
within
reach
of
the
early
news
of
our
proceeding
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Merridew
prove
to
be
all
pliability
and
indulgence
,
after
the
truly
considerate
manner
in
which
the
explosion
have
conduct
itself
;
and
Betteredge
be
accordingly
inform
that
we
be
all
four
to
travel
back
together
by
the
morning
train
.
<EOS>
I
fully
expect
that
he
would
have
ask
leave
to
accompany
us
.
<EOS>
but
Rachel
have
wisely
provide
her
faithful
old
servant
with
an
occupation
that
interest
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
charge
with
complete
the
refurnishing
of
the
house
,
and
be
too
full
of
his
domestic
responsibility
to
feel
the
"
detective
-
fever
"
as
he
may
have
feel
it
under
other
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
Our
one
subject
of
regret
,
in
go
to
London
,
be
the
necessity
of
parting
,
more
abruptly
than
we
could
have
wish
,
with
Ezra
Jennings
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
persuade
him
to
accompany
us
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
promise
to
write
to
him
 
and
Rachel
could
only
insist
on
his
come
to
see
her
when
she
return
to
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
there
be
every
prospect
of
our
meeting
again
in
a
few
month
 
and
yet
there
be
something
very
sad
in
see
our
good
and
dear
friend
leave
stand
alone
on
the
platform
,
as
the
train
move
out
of
the
station
.
  
<EOS>
on
our
arrival
in
London
,
Mr.
Bruff
be
accost
at
the
terminus
by
a
small
boy
,
dress
in
a
jacket
and
trouser
of
threadbare
black
cloth
,
and
personally
remarkable
in
virtue
of
the
extraordinary
prominence
of
his
eye
.
<EOS>
They
project
so
far
,
and
they
roll
about
so
loosely
,
that
you
wonder
uneasily
why
they
remain
in
their
socket
.
<EOS>
after
listen
to
the
boy
,
Mr.
Bruff
ask
the
lady
whether
they
would
excuse
our
accompany
them
back
to
Portland
Place
.
<EOS>
I
have
barely
time
to
promise
Rachel
that
I
would
return
,
and
tell
her
everything
that
have
happen
,
before
Mr.
Bruff
seize
me
by
the
arm
,
and
hurry
me
into
a
cab
.
<EOS>
the
boy
with
the
ill
-
secure
eye
take
his
place
on
the
box
by
the
driver
,
and
the
driver
be
direct
to
go

<EOS>
It

then
time
for
Mr.
Bruff
to
go
to
Hampstead

and
for
me

<EOS>
I

that
I

at
Portland

on

with
Rachel

in
a

forty
foot
long
,
with
Mrs.
Merridew

<EOS>
do
anybody
wonder
that
I
get
home

instead
of
half
past
ten
?
<EOS>
how
thoroughly
heartless
that
person
must
be
!
<EOS>
and
how
earnestly
I
hope
I
may
never
make
that

's
acquaintance
!
  
<EOS>
My

hand
me
a
morsel
of
paper
when

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Inquiry
prove
that
a
boy
,
with
very
extraordinary
-
look
eye
,
have
call
,
and
present
my
card
and
message
,
have
wait
an
hour
,
have
do
nothing

fall
asleep

wake
up
again
,
have
write
a

and
have
go

after
gravely
inform
the

that
"
he

fit
for
nothing
unless
he
get
his
night
's
rest
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
nine
,
the
next
morning
,
I
be
ready
for
my
visitor
.
<EOS>
at
half
past
nine
,
I
hear
step
outside
my
door
.
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
Gooseberry
!
<EOS>
"
I
call
out
.
"
<EOS>
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
answer
a
grave
and
melancholy
voice
.
<EOS>
the
door
open
.
<EOS>
I
start
to
my
foot
,
and
confront
 
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
would
look
in
here
,
Mr.
Blake
,
on
the
chance
of
your
being
in
town
,
before
I
write
to
Yorkshire
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
as
dreary
and
as
lean
as
ever
.
<EOS>
His
eye
have
not
lose
their
old
trick
(
so
subtly
notice
in
Betteredge
's
NARRATIVE
)
of
"
look
as
if
they
expect
something
more
from
you
than
you
be
aware
of
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
so
far
as
dress
can
alter
a
man
,
the
great
Cuff
be
change
beyond
all
recognition
.
<EOS>
He
wear
a
broad
-
brim
white
hat
,
a
light
shoot
jacket
,
white
trouser
,
and
drab
gaiter
.
<EOS>
He
carry
a
stout
oak
stick
.
<EOS>
His
whole
aim
and
object
seem
to
be
to
look
as
if
he
have
live
in
the
country
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
when
I
compliment
him
on
his
metamorphosis
,
he
decline
to
take
it
as
a
joke
.
<EOS>
He
complain
,
quite
gravely
,
of
the
noise
and
the
smell
of
London
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
be
far
from
sure
that
he
do
not
speak
with
a
slightly
rustic
accent
!
<EOS>
I
offer
him
breakfast
.
<EOS>
the
innocent
countryman
be
quite
shocked
.
<EOS>
his
breakfast
hour
be
half
-
past
six
 
<EOS>
and
he
go
to
bed
with
the
cock
and
hen
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
get
back
from
Ireland
last
night
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
come
round
to
the
practical
object
of
his
visit
,
in
his
own
impenetrable
manner
.
<EOS>
"
before
I
go
to
bed
,
I
read
your
letter

tell
me
what
have
happen
since
my
inquiry
after
the
Diamond

suspend
last
year
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
thing
to
be
say
about
the
matter
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
I
completely
mistake
my
case
.
<EOS>
how
any
man
live
be
to
have
see
thing
in
their
true
light
,
in
such
a
situation
as
mine
be
at
the
time
,
I
do
not
profess
to
know
.
<EOS>
but
that
do
not
alter
the
fact
as
they
stand
.
<EOS>
I
own
that
I
make
a
mess
of
it
.
<EOS>
not
the
first
mess
,
Mr.
Blake
,
which
have
distinguish
my
professional
career
!
<EOS>
It
be
only
in
book
that
the
officer
of
the
detective
force
be
superior
to
the
weakness
of
make
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
in
the
nick
of
time
to
recover
your

I

<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon

Mr.
Blake

rejoin
the
Sergeant

<EOS>
"
now
I
have
retire
from

about
my

<EOS>
I
tell
him
of
the
experiment
with
the
opium
,
and
of
what
have
occur
afterwards
at
the
bank
in
Lombard
Street
.
<EOS>
He
be
greatly
strike
by
the
experiment
 
<EOS>
it
be
something
entirely
new
in
his
experience

<EOS>
and
he

particularly
interested
in
the
theory
of
Ezra
Jennings

relate
to
what
I
have
do
with

Diamond
,
after
I
have
leave
Rachel

birthday
night

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
hold
with
Mr.
Jennings
that
you
hide
the
Moonstone
,
"
say
Sergeant
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
agree
with
him
,
that
you
must
certainly
have
take
it
back
to
your
own
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

I
ask

"
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
rise
,
and
go
to
my
writing

table
.
<EOS>
He
come
back
with

<EOS>
It

he

wait

Mr.

till
you

<EOS>
I
put
the

ask
for

the
measure

<EOS>
It

He

after
his
old
friend
Betteredge

<EOS>
in

more

I
(
with
Gooseberry
on

box
to
guide
the

)
be
on
our
way
eastward
,
towards
the
City
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
of
these
day
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
,
point
through
the
front
window
of
the
cab
,
"
that
boy
will
do
great
thing
in
my
late
profession
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
bright
and
clever
little
chap
I
have
meet
with
,
for
many
a
long
year
past
.
<EOS>
You
shall
hear
the
substance
,
Mr.
Blake
,
of
what
he
tell
me
while
you
be
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
You
be
present
,
I
think
,
when
he
mention
that
he
hold
on
behind
the
cab
,
and
run
after
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
the
cab
go
from
Lombard
Street
to
the
Tower
Wharf
.
<EOS>
the
sailor
with
the
black
beard
get
out
,
and
speak
to
the
steward
of
the
Rotterdam
steamboat
,
which
be
to
start
next
morning
.
<EOS>
He
ask
if
he
could
be
allow
to
go
on
board
at
once
,
and
sleep
in
his
berth
over
-
night
.
<EOS>
the
steward
say
,
no
.
<EOS>
the
cabin
,
and
berth
,
and
bedding
be
all
to
have
a
thorough
cleaning
that
evening
,
and
no
passenger
could
be
allow
to
come
on
board
,
before
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
sailor
turn
round
,
and
leave
the
wharf
.
<EOS>
when
he
get
into
the
street
again
,
the
boy
notice
for
the
first
time
,
a
man
dress
like
a
respectable
mechanic
,
walk
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
,
and
apparently
keep
the
sailor
in
view
.
<EOS>
the
sailor
stop
at
an
eat
-
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
go
in
.
<EOS>
the
boy
 
not
be
able
to
make
up
his
mind
,
at
the
moment
 
hang
about
among
some
other
boy
,
stare
at
the
good
thing
in
the
eat
-
house
window
.
<EOS>
He
notice
the
mechanic
wait
,
as
he
himself
be
wait
 
but
still
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
after
a
minute
,
a
cab
come
by
slowly
,
and
stop
where
the
mechanic
be
stand
.
<EOS>
the
boy
could
only
see
plainly
one
person
in
the
cab
,
who
lean
forward
at
the
window
to
speak
to
the
mechanic
.
<EOS>
He
describe
that
person
,
Mr.
Blake
,
without
any
prompting
from
me
,
as
have
a
dark
face
,
like
the
face
of
an
Indian
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
plain
,
by
this
time
,
that
Mr.
Bruff
and
I
have
make
another
mistake
.
<EOS>
the
sailor
with
the
black
beard
be
clearly
not
a
spy
in
the
service
of
the
indian
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
be
he
,
by
any
possibility
,
the
man
who
have
get
the
Diamond
?
  
<EOS>
"
after
a
little
,
"
pursue
the
Sergeant
,
"
the
cab
move
on
slowly
down
the
street
.
<EOS>
the
mechanic
cross
the
road
,
and
go
into
the
eat
-
house
.
<EOS>
the
boy
wait
outside
till
he
be
hungry
and
tired
 
and
then
go
into
the
eat
-
house
,
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
;
and
he
dine
sumptuously
,
he
tell
me
,
on
a
black
-
pudding
,
an
eel
-
pie
,
and
a
bottle
of
ginger
-
beer
.
<EOS>
what
can
a
boy
not
digest
?
<EOS>
the
substance
in
question
have
never
be
find
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
see
in
the
eat
-
house
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mr.
Blake
,
he
see
the
sailor
read
the
newspaper
at
one
table
,
and
the
mechanic
read
the
newspaper
at
another
.
<EOS>
It
be
dusk
before
the
sailor
get
up
,
and
leave
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
look
about
him
suspiciously
when
he
get
out
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
the
boy
 
be
a
boy
 
pass
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
the
mechanic
have
not
come
out
yet
.
<EOS>
the
sailor
walk
on
,
look
about
him
,
and
apparently
not
very
certain
of
where
he
be
go
next
.
<EOS>
the
mechanic
appear
once
more
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
the
sailor
go
on
,
till
he
get
to
Shore
Lane
,
lead
into
Lower
Thames
Street
.
<EOS>
there
he
stop
before
a
public
-
house
,
under
the
sign
of
"
the
Wheel
of
Fortune
,
"
and
,
after
examine
the
place
outside
,
go
in
.
<EOS>
Gooseberry
go
in
too
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
many
people
,
mostly
of
the
decent
sort
,
at
the
bar
.
"
<EOS>
the
Wheel
of
Fortune
"
be
a
very
respectable
house
,
Mr.
Blake
;
famous
for
its
porter
and
pork
-
pie
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Sergeant
's
digression
irritate
me
.
<EOS>
He
see
it
;
and
confine
himself
more
strictly
to
Gooseberry
's
evidence
when
he
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
sailor
,
"
he
resume
,
"
ask
if
he
could
have
a
bed
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
say
"
no
;
they
be
full
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
barmaid
correct
him
,
and
say
"
Number
Ten
be
empty
.
"
<EOS>
a
waiter
be
send
for
to
show
the
sailor
to
Number
ten
.
<EOS>
just
before
that
,
Gooseberry
have
notice
the
mechanic
among
the
people
at
the
bar
.
<EOS>
before
the
waiter
have
answer
the
call
,
the
mechanic
have
vanish
.
<EOS>
the
sailor
be
take
off
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
not
know
what
to
do
next
,
Gooseberry
have
the
wisdom
to
wait
and
see
if
anything
happen
.
<EOS>
something
do
happen
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
be
call
for
.
<EOS>
angry
voice
be
hear
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
the
mechanic
suddenly
make
his
appearance
again
,
collar
by
the
landlord
,
and
exhibit
,
to
Gooseberry
's
great
surprise
,
all
the
sign
and
token
of
be
drunk
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
thrust
him
out
at
the
door
,
and
threaten
him
with
the
police
if
he
come
back
.
<EOS>
from
the
altercation
between
them
,
while
this
be
go
on
,
it
appear
that
the
man
have
be
discover
in
Number
ten
,
and
have
declare
with
drunken
obstinacy
that
he
have
take
the
room
.
<EOS>
Gooseberry
be
so
strike
by
this
sudden
intoxication
of
a
previously
sober
person
,
that
he
could
not
resist
run
out
after
the
mechanic
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
he
be
in
sight
of
the
public
-
house
,
the
man
reel
about
in
the
most
disgraceful
manner
.
<EOS>
the
moment
he
turn
the
corner
of
the
street
,
he
recover
his
balance
instantly
,
and
become
as
sober
a
member
of
society
as
you
could
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
Gooseberry
go
back
to
"
the
Wheel
of
Fortune
"
in
a
very
bewildered
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
He
wait
about
again
,
on
the
chance
of
something
happen
.
<EOS>
nothing
happen
;
and
nothing
more
be
to
be
hear
,
or
see
,
of
the
sailor
.
<EOS>
Gooseberry
decide
on
go
back
to
the
office
.
<EOS>
just
as
he
come
to
this
conclusion
,
who
should
appear
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
as
usual
,
but
the
mechanic
again
!
<EOS>
He
look
up
at
one
particular
window
at
the
top
of
the
public
-
house
,
which
be
the
only
one
that
have
a
light
in
it
.
<EOS>
the
light
seem
to
relieve
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
leave
the
place
directly
.
<EOS>
the
boy
make
his
way
back
to
Gray
's
Inn
 
<EOS>
get
your
card
and
message
 
call
 
and
fail
to
find
you
.
<EOS>
there
you
have
the
state
of
the
case
,
Mr.
Blake
,
as
it
stand
at
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
own
opinion
of
the
case
,
Sergeant
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
serious
,
sir
.
<EOS>
judge
by
what
the
boy
see
,
the
Indians
be
in
it
,
to
begin
with
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
and
the
sailor
be
evidently
the
person
to
whom
Mr.
Luker
pass
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
It
seem
odd
that
Mr.
Bruff
,
and
I
,
and
the
man
in
Mr.
Bruff
's
employment
,
should
all
have
be
mistake
about
who
the
person
be
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
at
all
,
Mr.
Blake
.
<EOS>
consider
the
risk
that
person
run
,
it
be
likely
enough
that
Mr.
Luker
purposely
mislead
you
,
by
previous
arrangement
between
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
understand
the
proceeding
at
the
public
-
house
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
the
man
dress
like
a
mechanic
be
act
of
course
in
the
employment
of
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
as
much
puzzle
to
account
for
his
sudden
assumption
of
drunkenness
as
Gooseberry
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
give
a
guess
at
what
it
mean
,
sir
,
"
say
the
Sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
reflect
,
you
will
see
that
the
man
must
have
have
some
pretty
strict
instruction
from
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
They
be
far
too
noticeable
themselves
to
risk
be
see
at
the
bank
,
or
in
the
public
-
house
 
they
be
oblige
to
trust
everything
to
their
deputy
.
<EOS>
very
good
.
<EOS>
Their
deputy
hear
a
certain
number
name
in
the
public
-
house
,
as
the
number
of
the
room
which
the
sailor
be
to
have
for
the
night
 
that
be
also
the
room
(
unless
our
notion
be
all
wrong
)
which
the
Diamond
be
to
have
for
the
night
,
too
.
<EOS>
under
those
circumstance
,
the
Indians
,
you
may
rely
on
it
,
would
insist
on
have
a
description
of
the
room
 
of
its
position
in
the
house
,
of
its
capability
of
be
approach
from
the
outside
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
man
to
do
,
with
such
order
as
these
?
<EOS>
just
what
he
do
!
<EOS>
He
run
up
-
stair
to
get
a
look
at
the
room
,
before
the
sailor
be
take
into
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
find
there
,
make
his
observation
 
<EOS>
and
he
sham
drunk
,
as
the
easy
way
of
get
out
of
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
that
be
how
I
read
the
riddle
.
<EOS>
after
he
be
turn
out
of
the
public
-
house
,
he
probably
go
with
his
report
to
the
place
where
his
employer
be
wait
for
him
.
<EOS>
and
his
employer
,
no
doubt
,
send
him
back
to
make
sure
that
the
sailor
be
really
settle
at
the
public
-
house
till
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
as
for
what
happen
at
"
the
Wheel
of
Fortune
,
"
after
the
boy
leave
 
we
ought
to
have
discover
that
last
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
eleven
in
the
morning
,
now
.
<EOS>
We
must
hope
for
the
good
,
and
find
out
what
we
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
,
the
cab
stop
in
Shore
Lane
,
and
Gooseberry
open
the
door
for
us
to
get
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
right
?
"
ask
the
Sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
"
answer
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
we
enter
"
the
Wheel
of
Fortune
"
it
be
plain
even
to
my
inexperienced
eye
that
there
be
something
wrong
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
person
behind
the
counter
at
which
the
liquor
be
serve
,
be
a
bewilder
servant
girl
,
perfectly
ignorant
of
the
business
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
customer
,
wait
for
their
morning
drink
,
be
tap
impatiently
on
the
counter
with
their
money
.
<EOS>
the
bar
-
maid
appear
from
the
inner
region
of
the
parlour
,
excited
and
preoccupied
.
<EOS>
She
answer
Sergeant
Cuff
's

for
the
landlord
,
by
tell
him
sharply
that
her
master
be
up

and
be
not
to
be
bother
by
anybody
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
along
with
me
,
sir
,
"
say
Sergeant
Cuff
,
coolly
lead
the
way
up
-
stair
,
and
beckon
to
the
boy
to
follow
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
barmaid
call
to
her
master
,
and
warn
him
that
stranger
be
intrude
themselves
into
the
house

<EOS>
on
the
first
floor
we
be
encounter
by
the
Landlord
,
hurry
down
,
in
a
highly
irritated
state
,
to
see
what
be
the

<EOS>
"

the

he
ask

quietly

the
angry
landlord
throw
open
the
door
of
a

ask
the

's
pardon

<EOS>
I
have
be
out
this
morning
 
<EOS>
and
I
only
get
back
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
I
have
hammer
at
the
door
myself
 
and
all
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
potboy
have
go
to
fetch
a
carpenter
.
<EOS>
if
you
can
wait
a
few
minute
,
gentleman
,
we
will
have
the
door
open
,
and
see
what
it
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
the
man
drunk
last
night
?
"
ask
Sergeant
Cuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
perfectly
sober
,
sir
 
or
I
would
never
have
let
him
sleep
in
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
pay
for
his
bed
beforehand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
he
leave
the
room
in
any
way
,
without
go
out
by
the

?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
room
be
a
garret
,
"
say
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
a
trap
-
door
in
the
ceiling
,
lead
out
on
to
the
roof
 
and
a
little
low
down
the
street
,
there
be
an
empty
house
under
repair
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
,
Sergeant
,
the
blackguard
have
get
off
in
that
way
,
without
pay
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
sailor
,
"
say
Sergeant
Cuff
,
"
may
have
do
it
 
early
in
the
morning
,
before
the
street
be
astir
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
use
to
climb
,
and
his
head
would
not
fail
him
on
the
roof
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
the
arrival
of
the
carpenter
be
announce
.
<EOS>
We
all
go
up
-
stair
,
at
once
,
to
the
top
story
.
<EOS>
I
notice
that
the
Sergeant
be
unusually
grave
,
even
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
also
strike
me
as
odd
that
he
tell
the
boy
(
after
have
previously
encourage
him
to
follow
us
)
,
to
wait
in
the
room
below
till
we
come
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
carpenter
's
hammer
and
chisel
disposed
of
the
resistance
of
the
door
in
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
but
some
article
of
furniture
have
be
place
against
it
inside
,
as
a
barricade
.
<EOS>
by
push
at
the
door
,
we
thrust
this
obstacle
aside
,
and
so
get
admission
to
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
enter
first
;
the
Sergeant
second
;
and
I
third
.
<EOS>
the
other
person
present
follow
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
look
towards
the
bed
,
and
all
start
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
have
not
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
lie
,
dress
,
on
the
bed
 
with
a
white
pillow
over
his
face
,
which
completely
hide
it
from
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
that
mean
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
landlord
,
point
to
the
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
Sergeant
Cuff
lead
the
way
to
the
bed
,
without
answer
,
and
remove
the
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
's
swarthy
face
be
placid
and
still
;
his
black
hair
and
beard
be
slightly
,
very
slightly
,
discompose
.
<EOS>
His
eye
stare
wide
-
open
,
glassy
and
vacant
,
at
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
the
filmy
look
and
the
fix
expression
of
them
horrify
me
.
<EOS>
I
turn
away
,
and
go
to
the
open
window
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
them
remain

where

the

<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
the
waiter
be
despatch
on
both
errand
.
<EOS>
some
strange
fascination
seem
to
hold
Sergeant
Cuff
to
the
bed
.
<EOS>
some
strange
curiosity
seem
to
keep
the
rest
of
them
wait
,
to
see
what
the
Sergeant
would
do
next
.
  
<EOS>
I
turn
again
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
the
moment
afterwards
,
I
feel
a
soft
pull
at
my
coat
-
tail
,
and
a
small
voice
whisper
,
"
<EOS>
look

"
  
<EOS>
Gooseberry
have
follow
us
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
His
loose
eye
roll
frightfully
 
not
in
terror
,
but
in
exultation
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
a
detective
-
discovery
on
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
"
look
here
,
sir
,
"
he
repeat
 
and
lead
me
to
a
table
in
the
corner
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
table
stand
a

<EOS>
those
line
remove
all
further
doubt
,
on

point
at

the

that
have
occur
in
the
production
of
the
Report
,
with
which
I
engage
to

<EOS>
I
have
wait
to
make
it
a
complete
report
;
and
I
have
be
meet
,
here
and
there
,
by
obstacle
which
it
be
only
possible
to
remove
by
some
little
expenditure
of
patience
and
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
object
which
I
propose
to
myself
have
now
,
I
hope
,
be
attain
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
,
in
these
page
,
answer
to
the
great
part
 
if
not
all
 
of
the
question
,
concern
the
late
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
,
which
occur
to
your
mind
when
I
last
have
the
honour
of
see
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
propose
to
tell
you
 
in
the
first
place
 
what
be
know
of
the
manner
in
which
your
cousin
meet
his
death
;
append
to
the
statement
such
inference
and
conclusion
as
we
be
justified
(
accord
to
my
opinion
)
in
draw
from
the
fact
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
then
endeavour
 
in
the
second
place
 
to
put
you
in
possession
of
such
discovery
as
I
have
make
,
respect
the
proceeding
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
,
before
,
during
and
after
the
time
,
when
you
and
he
meet
as
guest
at
the
late
Lady
Verinder
's
country
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
II
  
<EOS>
as
to
your
cousin
's
death
,
then
,
first
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
to
be
establish
,
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
,
that
he
be
kill
(
while
he
be
asleep
,
or
immediately
on
his
waking
)
by
be
smother
with
a
pillow
from
his
bed
 
that
the
person
guilty
of
murder
him
be
the
three
Indians
 
and
that
the
object
contemplate
(
and
achieve
)
by
the
crime
,
be
to
obtain
possession
of
the
diamond
,
call
the
Moonstone
.
  
<EOS>
the
fact
from
which
this
conclusion
be
draw
,
be
derive
partly
from
an
examination
of
the
room
at
the
tavern
;
and
partly
from
the
evidence
obtain
at
the
Coroner
's
Inquest
.
  
<EOS>
on
force
the
door
of
the
room
,
the
deceased
gentleman
be
discover
,
dead
,
with
the
pillow
of
the
bed
over
his
face
.
<EOS>
the
medical
man
who
examine
him
,
be
inform
of
this
circumstance
,
consider
the
post
-
mortem
appearance
as
be
perfectly
compatible
with
murder
by
smother
 
that
be
to
say
,
with
murder
commit
by
some
person
,
or
person
,
press
the
pillow
over
the
nose
and
mouth
of
the
deceased
,
until
death
result
from
congestion
of
the
lung
.
  
<EOS>
next
,
as
to
the
motive
for
the
crime
.
  
<EOS>
a
small
box
,
with
a
seal
paper
tear
off
from
it
(
the
paper
contain
an
inscription
)
be
find
open
,
and
empty
,
on
a
table
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
have
himself
personally
identify
the
box
,
the
seal
,
and
the
inscription
.
<EOS>
He
have
declare
that
the
box
do
actually
contain
the
diamond
,
call
the
Moonstone
;
and
he
have
admit
have
give
the
box
(
thus
seal
up
)
to
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
(
then
conceal
under
a
disguise
)
,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
twenty
-
sixth
of
June
last
.
<EOS>
the
fair
inference
from
all
this
be
,
that
the
stealing
of
the
Moonstone
be
the
motive
of
the
crime
.
  
<EOS>
next
,
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
crime
be
commit
.
  
<EOS>
on
examination
of
the
room
(
which
be
only
seven
foot
high
)
,
a
trap
-
door
in
the
ceiling
,
lead
out
on
to
the
roof
of
the
house
,
be
discover
open
.
<EOS>
the
short
ladder
,
use
for
obtain
access
to
the
trap
-
door
(
and
keep
under
the
bed
)
,
be
find
place
at
the
opening
,
so
as
to
enable
any
person
or
person
,
in
the
room
,
to
leave
it
again
easily
.
<EOS>
in
the
trap
-
door
itself
be
find
a
square
aperture
cut
in
the
wood
,
apparently
with
some
exceedingly
sharp
instrument
,
just
behind
the
bolt
which
fasten
the
door
on
the
inner
side
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
,
any
person
from
the
outside
could
have
draw
back
the
bolt
,
and
open
the
door
,
and
have
drop
(
or
have
be
noiselessly
lower
by
an
accomplice
)
into
the
room
 
its
height
,
as
already
observe
,
be
only
seven
foot
.
<EOS>
that
some
person
,
or
person
,
must
have
get
admission
in
this
way
,
appear
evident
from
the
fact
of
the
aperture
be
there
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
(
or
they
)
obtain
access
to
the
roof
of
the
tavern
,
it
be
to
be
remark
that
the
third
house
,
low
down
in
the
street
,
be
empty
,
and
under
repair
 
that
a
long
ladder
be
leave
by
the
workman
,
lead
from
the
pavement
to
the
top
of
the
house
 
and
that
,
on
return
to
their
work
,
on
the
morning
of
the
27th
,
the
man
find
the
plank
which
they
have
tie
to
the
ladder
,
to
prevent
anyone
from
use
it
in
their
absence
,
remove
,
and
lie
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
possibility
of
ascend
by
this
ladder
,
pass
over
the
roof
of
the
house
,
pass
back
,
and
descend
again
,
unobserved
 
it
be
discover
,
on
the
evidence
of
the
night
policeman
,
that
he
only
pass
through
Shore
Lane
twice
in
an
hour
,
when
out
on
his
beat
.
<EOS>
the
testimony
of
the
inhabitant
also
declare
,
that
Shore
Lane
,
after
midnight
,
be
one
of
the
quiet
and
lonely
street
in
London
.
<EOS>
here
again
,
therefore
,
it
seem
fair
to
infer
that
 
with
ordinary
caution
,
and
presence
of
mind
 
<EOS>
any
man
,
or
man
,
may
have
ascend
by
the
ladder
,
and
may
have
descend
again
,
unobserved
.
<EOS>
once
on
the
roof
of
the
tavern
,
it
have
be
prove
,
by
experiment
,
that
a
man
may
cut
through
the
trap
-
door
,
while
lie
down
on
it
,
and
that
in
such
a
position
,
the
parapet
in
front
of
the
house
would
conceal
him
from
the
view
of
anyone
pass
in
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
lastly
,
as
to
the
person
,
or
person
,
by
whom
the
crime
be
commit
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
know
(

)
that
the
Indians
have
an
interest
in
possess
themselves
of
the
Diamond
.
<EOS>
(

<EOS>
It
be
at
least
probable
that
the
man
look
like
an
Indian
,
whom
Octavius
Guy
see
at
the
window
of
the
cab
,
speak
to
the
man
dress
like
a
mechanic
,
be
one
of
the
three
Hindoo
conspirator
.
<EOS>
(

<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
this
same
man
dress
like
a
mechanic
,
be
see
keep
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
in
view
,
all
through
the
evening
of
the
26th
,
and
be
find
in
the
bedroom
(
before
Mr.
Ablewhite

which
lead

which
person
expert

declare
to

and
to
be
a
species
of
gold

not

in
England
.
<EOS>
(

<EOS>
on
the
morning
of

the
Tower
Wharf

<EOS>
there
be
here
,
moral
,
if
not
legal
,
evidence
,
that
the
murder
be
commit
by
the
Indians
.
  
<EOS>
whether
the
man
personate
a
mechanic
be
,
or
be
not
,
an
accomplice
in
the
crime
,
it
be
impossible
to
say
.
<EOS>
that
he
could
have
commit
the
murder
alone
,
seem
beyond
the
limit
of
probability
.
<EOS>
act
by
himself
,
he
could
hardly
have
smother
Mr.
Ablewhite
 
<EOS>
who
be
the
tall
and
strong
man
of
the
two
 
without

<EOS>
the
landlord

<EOS>
the
whole
evidence
point
to
the
inference
that
more
than
one
man
be
concern
in
this
crime
 
and
the
circumstance
<EOS>
,
I
repeat
,
morally
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
Indians
commit
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
add
,
that
the
verdict
at
the
Coroner
's
Inquest
be
wilful
murder
against
some
person
,
or
person
,
unknown
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ablewhite
's
family
have
offer
a
reward
,
and
no
effort
have
be
leave
untried
to
discover
the
guilty
person

<EOS>
the
man

have
elude
all
inquiry

<EOS>
the
Indians
have
be
trace
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
prospect
of
ultimately
capture
these
last
,
I
shall
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
on
that
head
,
when
I
reach
the
end
of
the
present
report
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
,
have
now
write
all
that
be
needful
on
the
subject
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
death
,
I
may
pass
next
to
the
narrative
of
his
proceeding
before
,
during
,
and
after
the
time
,
when
you
and
he
meet
at
the
late
Lady
Verinder
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
iii
  
<EOS>
with
regard
to
the
subject
now
in
hand
,
I
may
state
,
at
the
outset
,
that
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
's
life
have
two
side
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
side
turn
up
to
the
public
view
,
present
the
spectacle
of
a
gentleman
,
possess
of
considerable
reputation
as
a
speaker
at
charitable
meeting
,
and
endow
with
administrative
ability
,
which
he
place
at
the
disposal
of
various
Benevolent
Societies
,
mostly
of
the
female
sort
.
<EOS>
the
side
keep
hide
from
the
general
notice
,
exhibit
this
same
gentleman
in
the
totally
different
character
of
a
man
of
pleasure
,
with
a
villa
in
the
suburb
which
be
not
take
in
his
own
name
,
and
with
a
lady
in
the
villa
,
who
be
not
take
in
his
own
name
,
either
.
  
<EOS>
My
investigation
in
the
villa
have
show
me
several
fine
picture
and
statue
;
furniture
tastefully
select
,
and
admirably
make
;
and
a
conservatory
of
the
rare
flower
,
the
match
of
which
it
would
not
be
easy
to
find
in
all
London
.
<EOS>
My
investigation
of
the
lady
have
result
in
the
discovery
of
jewel
which
be
worthy
to
take
rank
with
the
flower
,
and
of
carriage
and
horse
which
have
(
deservedly
)
produce
a
sensation
in
the
Park
,
among
person
well
qualified
to
judge
of
the
build
of
the
one
,
and
the
breed
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
,
so
far
,
common
enough
.
<EOS>
the
villa
and
the
lady
be
such
familiar
object
in
London
life
,
that
I
ought
to
apologise
for
introduce
them
to
notice
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
not
common
and
not
familiar
(
in
my
experience
)
,
be
that
all
these
fine
thing
be
not
only
order
,
but
pay
for
.
<EOS>
the
picture
,
the
statue
,
the
flower
,
the
jewel
,
the
carriage
,
and
the
horse
 
inquiry
prove
,
to
my
indescribable
astonishment
,
that
not
a
sixpence
of
debt
be
owe
on
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
villa
,
it
have
be
buy
,
out
and

and
settle
on
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
have
try
to
find
the
right
reading
of
this
riddle
,
and
try
in
vain
 
but
for
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite

and
that

Would
Mr.

Would

<EOS>
upon
this
compulsion
,
Mr.
Godfrey

an
effort
,
and
come
out
with
a
new
and
amended
version
of

some
effect
on
you
,
which
have
not

what
you
would
do

Your

<EOS>
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
go
back
,
with
the
Diamond
,
into
his
own

.
<EOS>
His
statement
be
,
that
he
come
to
no
conclusion
,
at
that
time
 
except
that
he
would
wait
,
and
see
what
happen
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
morning
come
,
your
language
and
conduct
show
that
you
be
absolutely
ignorant
of
what
you
have
say
and
do
overnight
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
Miss
Verinder
's
language
and
conduct
show
that
she
be
resolve
to
say
nothing
(
in
mercy
to
you
)
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
choose
to
keep
the
Diamond
,
he
may
do
so
with
perfect
impunity
.
<EOS>
the
Moonstone
stand
between
him
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
Moonstone
into
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
v
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
story
tell
by
your
cousin
(
under
pressure
of
necessity
)
to
Mr.
Luker
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
believe
the
story
to
be
,
as
to
all
main
essential
,
true
 
on
this
ground
,
that
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
be
too
great
a
fool
to
have
invent
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bruff
and
I
agree
with
Mr.
Luker
,
in
consider
this
test
of
the
truth
of
the
story
to
be
a
perfectly
reliable
one
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
question
,
be
the
question
of
what
Mr.
Luker
would
do
in
the
matter
of
the
Moonstone
.
<EOS>
He
propose
the
follow
term
,
as
the
only
term
on
which
he
would
consent
to
mix
himself
up
with
,
what
be
(
even
in
his
line
of
business
)
a
doubtful
and
dangerous
transaction
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
would
consent
to
lend
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
the
sum
of
two
thousand
pound
,
on
condition
that
the
Moonstone
be
to
be
deposit
with
him
as
a
pledge
.
<EOS>
if
,
at
the
expiration
of
one
year
from
that
date
,
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
pay
three
thousand
pound
to
Mr.
Luker
,
he
be
to
receive
back
the
Diamond
,
as
a
pledge
redeem
.
<EOS>
if
he
fail
to
produce
the
money
at
the
expiration
of
the
year
,
the
pledge
(
otherwise
the
Moonstone
)
be
to
be
consider
as
forfeit
to
Mr.
Luker
 
<EOS>
who
would
,
in
this
latter
case
,
generously
make
Mr.
Godfrey
a
present
of
certain
promissory
note
of
his
(
relate
to
former
dealing
)
which
be
then
in
the
money
-
lender
's
possession
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
needless
to
say
,
that
Mr.
Godfrey
indignantly
refuse
to
listen
to
these
monstrous
term
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
thereupon
,
hand
him
back
the
Diamond
,
and
wish
him
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
Your
cousin
go
to
the
door
,
and
come
back
again
.
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
be
sure
that
the
conversation
of
that
evening
would
be
keep
strictly
secret
between
his
friend
and
himself
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Luker
do
not
profess
to
know
how
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Godfrey
have
accept
his
term
,
Mr.
Godfrey
would
have
make
him
an
accomplice
,
and
may
have
count
on
his
silence
as
on
a
certainty
.
<EOS>
as
thing
be
,
Mr.
Luker
must
be
guide
by
his
own
interest
.
<EOS>
if
awkward
inquiry
be
make
,
how
could
he
be
expect
to
compromise
himself
,
for
the
sake
of
a
man
who
have
decline
to
deal
with
him
?
  
<EOS>
receive
this
reply
,
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
do
,
what
all
animal
(
human
and
otherwise
)
do
,
when
they
find
themselves
catch
in
a
trap
.
<EOS>
He
look
about
him
in
a
state
of
helpless
despair
.
<EOS>
the
day
of
the
month

card
in
a
box
on

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
on

twenty
-
fourth
he
have
three
hundred
pound
to
pay
to
the
young
gentleman
for
whom
he
be
trustee
,
and
no
chance
of
raise
the
money
,
except
the
chance
that
Mr.
Luker
have
offer
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
for
this
miserable
obstacle
,
he
may
have
take
the
Diamond
to
Amsterdam
,
and
have
make
a
marketable
commodity
of
it
,
by
have
it
cut
up
into
separate
stone
.
<EOS>
as
matter
stand
,
he
have
no
choice
but
to
accept
Mr.
Luker
's
term
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
he
have
a
year
at
his
disposal
,
in
which
to
raise
the
three
thousand
pound
 
and
a
year
be
a
long
time
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.

draw
out
the
necessary
document
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
sign
,
he
give
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
two
cheque

<EOS>

for

hundred

.
<EOS>
another
,
date
a

seventeen
hundred

.
  
<EOS>
how
the
Moonstone
be
trust
to
the
keeping
of
Mr
Luker
's
banker
,
and
how
the
Indians
treat
Mr.
Luker
and
Mr.
Godfrey
(
after
that
have
be
do
)
<EOS>
you
know
already
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
event
in
your
cousin
's
life
refer
again
to
Miss
Verinder
.
<EOS>
He
propose
marriage
to
her
for
the
second
time
 
<EOS>
and
(
after
have
be
accept
)
he
consent
,
at
her
request
,
to
consider
the
marriage
as
break
off
.
<EOS>
one
of
his
reason
for
make
this
concession
have
be
penetrate
by
Mr.
Bruff
.
<EOS>
Miss
Verinder
have
only
a
life
interest
in
her
mother
's
property
 
and
there
be
no
raise
the
twenty
thousand
pound
on
that
.
  
<EOS>
but
you
will
say
,
he
may
have
save
the
three
thousand
pound
,
to
redeem
the
pledge
Diamond
,
if
he
have
marry
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
do
so
certainly
 
supposing
neither
his
wife
,
nor
her
guardian
and
trustee
,
object
to
his
anticipate
more
than
half
of
the
income
at
his
disposal
,
for
some
unknown
purpose
,
in
the
first
year
of
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
but
even
if
he
get
over
this
obstacle
,
there
be
another
waiting
for
him
in
the
background
.
<EOS>
the
lady
at
the
Villa
,
have
hear
of
his
contemplate
marriage
.
<EOS>
a
superb
woman
,
Mr.
Blake
,
of
the
sort
that
be
not
to
be
trifle
with
 
the
sort
with
the
light
complexion
and
the
roman
nose
.
<EOS>
She
feel
the
utmost
contempt
for
Mr.
Godfrey
Ablewhite
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
silent
contempt
,
if
he
make
a
handsome
provision
for
her
.
<EOS>
otherwise
,
it
would
be
contempt
with
a
tongue
to
it
.
<EOS>
miss
Verinder
's
life
interest
allow
him
no
more
hope
of
raise
the
"
provision
"
than
of
raise
the
twenty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
marry
 
he
really
could
not
marry
,
under
all
the
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
how
he
try
his
luck
again
with
another
lady
,
and
how
that
marriage
also
break
down
on
the
question
of
money
,
you
know
already
.
<EOS>
You
also
know
of
the
legacy
of
five
thousand
pound
,
leave
to
him
shortly
afterwards
,
by
one
of
those
many
admirer
among
the
soft
sex
whose
good
grace
this
fascinating
man
have
contrive
to
win
.
<EOS>
that
legacy
(
as
the
event
have
prove
)
lead
him
to
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
ascertain
that
when
he
go
abroad
,
on
get
his
five
thousand
pound
,
he
go
to
Amsterdam
.
<EOS>
there
he
make
all
the
necessary
arrangement
for
have
the
Diamond
cut
into
separate
stone
.
<EOS>
He
come
back
(
in
disguise
)
,
and
redeem
the
Moonstone
,
on
the
appoint
day
.
<EOS>
a
few
day
be
allow
to
elapse
(
as
a
precaution
agree
to
by
both
party
)
before
the
jewel
be
actually
take
out
of
the
bank
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
get
safe
with
it
to
Amsterdam
,
there
would
have
be
just
time
between
July
"
forty
-
nine
,
and
February
"
fifty
(
when
the
young
gentleman
come
of
age
)
to
cut
the
Diamond
,
and
to
make
a
marketable
commodity
(
polished
or
unpolished
)
of
the
separate
stone
.
<EOS>
Judge
from
this
,
what
motive
he
have
to
run
the
risk
which
he
actually
run
.
<EOS>
It
be
"
neck
or
nothing
"
with
him
 
if
ever
it
be
"
neck
or
nothing
"
with
a

They

there

to
believe
)
on
their

to
Bombay

in
an

me
rest
,
unknown
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
try
to
plead
with
him
to
alter
his
resolution
,
he
become
for
the
first
,
and
only
time
,
violently
agitate
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
see
it
;
and
I
give
way
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
a
little
grass
mound
mark
the
place
of
his
rest
.
<EOS>
in
time
,
the
tombstones
will
rise
round
it
.
<EOS>
and
the
people
who
come
after
us
will
look
and
wonder
at
the
nameless
grave
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
tell
you
,
for
six
hour
before
his
death
his
suffering
cease
.
<EOS>
He
doze
a
little
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
dream
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
he
smile
.
<EOS>
a
woman
's
name
,
as
I
suppose
 
the
name
of
"
Ella
"
 
be
often
on
his
lip
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
a
few
minute
before
the
end
he
ask
me
to
lift
him
on
his
pillow
,
to
see
the
sun
rise
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
weak
.
<EOS>
His
head
fall
on
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
whisper
,
"
It
be
come
!
"
<EOS>
then
he
say
,
"
kiss
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
kiss
his
forehead
.
<EOS>
on
a
sudden
he
lift
his
head
.
<EOS>
the
sunlight
touch
his
face
.
<EOS>
a
beautiful
expression
,
an
angelic
expression
,
come
over
it
.
<EOS>
He
cry
out
three
time
,
"
peace
!
<EOS>
peace
!
<EOS>
peace
!
"
<EOS>
His
head
sink
back
again
on
my
shoulder
,
and
the
long
trouble
of
his
life
be
at
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
have
go
from
us
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
as
I
think
,
a
great
man
 
though
the
world
never
know
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
sweet
temper
I
have
ever
meet
with
.
<EOS>
the
loss
of
him
make
me
feel
very
lonely
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
have
never
be
quite
myself
since
my
illness
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
I
think
of
give
up
my
practice
,
and
go
away
,
and
try
what
some
of
the
foreign
bath
and
water
will
do
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
It

a
fact
in

which
have

that
way
.
<EOS>
the
fact
to
which
I
allude
be
 
the
marriage
of
Miss
Rachel
and
Mr.

Blake
.
<EOS>
this
interesting
event
take
place
at
our
house
in
Yorkshire
,
on
Tuesday
,
October
ninth
,
eighteen
hundred

<EOS>
I
have
a
new
suit
of
clothe
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
and
the
married
couple
go
to
spend
the
honeymoon
in
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
family
festival
have
be
rare
enough
at
our
house
,
since
my
poor
mistress
's
death
,
I
own
 
on
this
occasion
of
the
wedding
 
to
have
(
towards
the
latter
part
of
the
day
)
take
a
drop
too
much
on
the
strength
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
have
ever
do
the
same
sort
of
thing
yourself
you
will
understand
and
feel
for
me
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
not
,
you
will
very
likely
say
,
"
disgusting
old
man
!
<EOS>
why
do
he
tell
us
this
?
"
<EOS>
the
reason
why
be
now
to

take
my
drop
(

only
your
vice

<EOS>

I
next
apply
the
one
infallible
remedy
 
<EOS>
that
remedy
be
,
as
you

,
ROBINSON
crusoe
.
<EOS>
where
I
open
that
unrivalled
book
,
I
can
not

leave
off
run

however
,
perfectly
well

<EOS>
It
be
at
page

a
domestic
bit
concern
Robinson
Crusoe
's
marriage
,
as
follow
:
  
"
with
those
thought
,
I
consider
my
new
Engagement
,
that
I
have
a
Wife
"
 
(
observe

<EOS>
so
have
Mr.

)
 
<EOS>
"

Child

<EOS>
that

too
!
)
 
<EOS>
"
and
my
Wife
then
"
 
<EOS>
what
Robinson
Crusoe

wife
do
,
or
do
not
do
,
"
then
,
"
I
feel
no
desire
to
discover
.
<EOS>
I
score
the
bit
about
the
child
with
my
pencil
,
and
put
a
morsel
of
paper
for
a
mark
to
keep
the
place
;
"
lie
you
there
,
"
I
say
,
"
till

marriage
of
