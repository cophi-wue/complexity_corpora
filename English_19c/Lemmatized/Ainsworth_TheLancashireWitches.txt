<EOS>
torch

instant
.
 
<EOS>
the
watch
be
hold
one
afternoon
at
the
latter
end
of
November
,
1536
.
<EOS>
in
that
year
have
arise
a
formidable
rebellion
in
the
northern
county
of
England
,
the
member
of
which
,
while
engage
to
respect
the
person
of
the
king
,
Henry
VIII
.
,
and
his
issue
,
bind
themselves
by
solemn
oath
to
accomplish
the
restoration
of
Papal
supremacy
throughout
the
realm
,
and
the
restitution
of
religious
establishment
and
land
to
their
late
eject
possessor
.
<EOS>
They
bind
themselves
,
also
,
to
punish
the
enemy
of
the
romish
church
,
and
suppress
heresy
.
<EOS>
from
its
religious
character
the
insurrection
assume
the
name
of
the
Pilgrimage
of
Grace
,
and
number
among
its
adherent
all
who
have
not
embrace
the
new
doctrine
in
Yorkshire
and
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
that
such
an
outbreak
should
occur
on
the
suppression
of
the
monastery
,
be
not
marvellous
.
<EOS>
the
desecration
and
spoliation
of
so
many
sacred
structure
--
the
destruction
of
shrine
and
image
long
regard
with
veneration
--
the
ejection
of
so
many
ecclesiastic
,
renowne
for
hospitality
and
revere
for
piety
and
learning
--
the
violence
and
rapacity
of
the
commissioner
appoint
by
the
Vicar
-
General
Cromwell
to
carry
out
these
severe
measure
--
all
these
outrage
be
regard
by
the
people
with
abhorrence
,
and
dispose
them
to
aid
the
sufferer
in
resistance
.
<EOS>
as
yet
the
wealthy
monastery
in
the
north
have
be
spare
,
and
it
be
to
preserve
them
from
the
greedy
hand
of
the
visiter
,
Doctors
Lee
and
Layton
,
that
the
insurrection
have
be
undertake
.
<EOS>
a
simultaneous
rise
take
place
in
Lincolnshire
,
head
by
Makarel
,
Abbot
of
Barlings
,
but
it
be
speedily
quell
by
the
vigour
and
skill
of
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
and
its
leader
execute
.
<EOS>
but
the
northern
outbreak
be
better
organize
,
and
of
great
force
,
for
it
now
number
thirty
thousand
man
,
under
the
command
of
a
skilful
and
resolute
leader
name
Robert
Aske
.
 
<EOS>
as
may
be
suppose
,
the
priesthood
be
main
mover
in
a
revolt
have
their
especial
benefit
for
its
aim
;
and
many
of
them
,
follow
the
example
of
the
Abbot
of
Barlings
,
clothe
themselves
in
steel
instead
of
woollen
garment
,
and
gird
on
the
sword
and
the
breastplate
for
the
redress
of
their
grievance
and
the
maintenance
of
their
right
.
<EOS>
amongst
these
be
the
abbot
of
Jervaux
,
Furness
,
Fountains
,
Rivaulx
,
and
Salley
,
and
,
lastly
,
the
Abbot
of
Whalley
,
before
mention
;
a
fiery
and
energetic
prelate
,
who
have
ever
be
constant
and
determined
in
his
opposition
to
the
aggressive
measure
of
the
king
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
Pilgrimage
of
Grace
,
such
its
design
,
and
such
its
supporter

the

I

"
poverty
will
not
alone
be
the
fate
of
the
Church

of

whole

<EOS>
"
Cromwell

whether

It

<EOS>
the
abbot

command

and

glance
from

two
man
-
at

arm

number
of
thirty

forty

the
stone
wall
,
and
begin
to
scale
the
hill
with
great
rapidity

<EOS>
They
come
up
a
deep
dry
channel

apparently

in
the
hill

side
by

former
torrent

CHAPTER
II.--THE
ERUPTION
.
  
<EOS>
Demdike
go
a
little
further
down
the
hill
,
stop
when
he
come
to
the
green
patch
.
<EOS>
He
then
plunge
his
staff
into
the
sod
at
the
first
point
where
he
have
cast
a
tuft
of
heather
,
and
with
such
force
that
it
sink
more
than
three
foot
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
he
pluck
it
forth
,
as
if
with
a
great
effort
,
and
a
jet
of
black
water
spout
into
the
air
;
but
,
heedless
of
this
,
he
go
to
the
next
marked
spot
,
and
again
plunge
the
sharp
point
of
the
implement
into
the
ground
.
<EOS>
again
it
sink
to
the
same
depth
,
and
,
on
be
draw
out
,
a
second
black
jet
spring
forth
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
hostile
party
continue
to
advance
up
the
dry
channel
before
mention
,
and
shout
on
behold
these
strange
preparation
,
but
they
do
not
relax
their
speed
.
<EOS>
once
more
the
staff
sink
into
the
ground
,
and
a
third
black
fountain
follow
its
extraction
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
the
royalist
soldier
be
close
at
hand
,
and
the
feature
of
their
two
leader
,
John
Braddyll
and
Richard
Assheton
,
could
be
plainly
distinguished
,
and
their
voice
hear
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
he

'
<EOS>

rebel
abbot
!
"
<EOS>
vociferate
Braddyll
,
press
forward
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
not

<EOS>
He
have
be

"
 
<EOS>
"
Ho

<EOS>
"

Earl
of
poverty

"
respond
Assheton
.
<EOS>
"
the
villain
shall
be
gibbet
on
the
spot
where
he

beacon
,
as
a
warning
to
all

"
 
<EOS>
"
ha
,
heretics!--ha
,
blasphemers!--I
can
at
least
avenge
myself
upon
you
,
"
cry
Paslew
,
strike
spur
into
his
charger
.
<EOS>
but
ere
he
could
execute
his
purpose
,
Demdike
have
spring
backward
,
and
,
catch
the
bridle
,
restrain
the
animal
by
a
powerful
effort
.
 
<EOS>
"
hold
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
"
or
you
will
share
their
fate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
the
word
be
utter
,
a
dull
,
booming
,
subterranean
sound
be
hear
,
and
instantly
afterwards
,
with
a
crash
like
thunder
,
the
whole
of
the
green
circle
beneath
slip
off
,
and
from
a
yawning
rent
under
it
burst
forth
with
irresistible
fury
,
a
thick
inky
-
coloured
torrent
,
which
,
rise
almost
breast
high
,
fall
upon
the
devoted
royalist
soldier
,
who
be
advance
right
in
its
course
.
<EOS>
unable
to
avoid
the
watery
eruption
,
or
to
resist
its
fury
when
it
come
upon
them
,
they
be
instantly
sweep
from
their
foot
,
and
carry
down
the
channel
.
 
<EOS>
a
sight
of
horror
be
it
to
behold
the
sudden
rise
of
that
swarthy
stream
,
whose
water
,
tinge
by
the
ruddy
glare
of
the
beacon
-
fire
,
look
like
wave
of
blood
.
<EOS>
nor
less
fearful
be
it
to
hear
the
first
wild
despairing
cry
raise
by
the
victim
,
or
the
quickly
stifle
shriek
and
groan
that
follow
,
mix
with
the
deafening
roar
of
the
stream
,
and
the
crash
fall
of
the
stone
,
which
accompany
its
course
.
<EOS>
down
,
down

poor
wretch

by
the
torrent
,
now

their
foot
only
to
utter
a
scream

and
then
be

<EOS>
here

miserable
struggler

onward

at

bank
and

<EOS>
at
another
point

a
footing

the
current

He

<EOS>
the

He

He
would
have

his

be
stiffen
and
paralysed

and
he
could
only
gaze
aghast
at

<EOS>
amidst

but
a
churlish
guard
bid

and
menace

<EOS>
Closed

Neglected

<EOS>
all

a

<EOS>
in
the
plenitude
of
its
pride

Its

<EOS>
but

<EOS>
never

and

<EOS>
the

by
sacrilegious

<EOS>
but
all

bright

beauteous
now

and

no
solemn
strain

in
the
holy
pile
,
its
stillness

scarcely

reverential
and

<EOS>
the
old
abbey
wreathe
itself
in
all
its
attraction
,
as
if
to
welcome
back
its
former
ruler
,
whereas
it
be
only
to
receive
him
as
a
captive
doom
to
a
felon

death
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
outward
show
.
<EOS>
within
all
be
terrible
preparation
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
discontent
state
of
the
country
,
that
fear
some
new
revolt
,
the
Earl
of
Derby
have
take
measure
for
the
defence
of
the
abbey
,
and
along
the
wide

circle
wall
of
the
close

place
ordnance
and
man
,
and
within
the
grange
store
of
ammunition

<EOS>
a
strong
guard
be
set
at
each

the
gate

and
the
court

fill
with
troop

<EOS>
the
bray
of
the
trumpet
echo
within
the
close
,
where
round
be
set
for
the
archer
,
and
martial
music
resound
within
the
area
of
the
cloister
.
<EOS>
over
the
great
north

eastern
gateway
,
which
form
the
chief
entrance
to
the
abbot
's
lodging

float
the
royal
banner

<EOS>
despite
these
warlike
proceeding
the
fair
abbey
smile
beneath
the
sun
,
in
all
,
or
more
than
all
,
its
pristine
beauty
,
its
green
hill
slope
gently
down
towards
it
,
and
the
clear
and
sparkle
Calder
dash
merrily
over
the
stone
at
its
base
.
 
<EOS>
but
upon
the
bridge
,
and
by
the
river
side
,
and
within
the
little
village
,
many
person

assemble
,
converse
gravely
and
anxiously
together
,
and
look
out
towards
the
hill
,
where
other
group
be

as
if
in
expectation
of
some
afflicting
event

<EOS>
Most
of
these
be
herdsman
and
farm
man
,
but
some
among
them
be
poor
monk
in
the
white
habit
of
the
cistertian
brotherhood
,
but
which
be
now
stain
and
threadbare
,
while
their
countenance
bear
trace
of
severest
privation
and
suffering
.
<EOS>
all
the
herdsman
and
farmer
have
be
retainer
of
the
abbot
.
<EOS>
the
poor
monk
look
wistfully
at
their
former
habitation
,
but
reply
not
except
by
a
gentle
bowing
of
the
head
to
the
cruel
scoff
and
taunt
with
which
they
be
greet
by
the
pass
soldier
;
but
the
sturdy
rustic
do
not
bear
these
outrage
so
tamely
,
and
more
than
one
brawl
ensue
,
in
which
blood
flow
,
while
a
ruffianly
arquebussier
would
have
be
drown
in
the
Calder
but
for
the
exertion
to
save
him
of
a
monk

but
though
of
Herculean
build

it
soon
become
evident
that
Ashbead
would
have
the
bad
of

when

it

instant

to
spend
an
hour
in
prayer
in
a
little
chapel
on
an
adjoining
hill
,
overlook
a
most
picturesque
portion
of
the
forest
,
the
beauty
of
which
be
enhance
by
the
winding
of
the
Hodder
,
one
of
the
lovely
stream
in

scene
familiar

almost
from
infancy

noble
tree

like
old
friend

to
whom
he
be
bid
an
eternal
adieu
,
stand
around
him
.
<EOS>
beneath
them
,
at
the
end
of
a
glade
,
couch
a
herd
of
deer
,
which
start
off
at
sight
of
the
intruder
,
and
make
him
envy
their
freedom
and
fleetness
as
he
follow
them
in
thought
to
their
solitude
.
<EOS>
at
the
foot
of
a
steep
rock
run
the
Hodder
,
make
the
pleasant
music
of
other
day
as
it
dash
over
its
pebbly
bed
,
and
recalling
time
,
when
,
free
from
all
care
,
he
have
stray
by
its
wood
-
fringe
bank
,
to
listen
to
the
pleasant
sound
of
run
water
,
and
watch
the
shine
pebble
beneath
them
,
and
the
swift
trout
and
dainty
umber
glance
past
.
 
<EOS>
a
bitter
pang
be
it
to
part
with
scene
so
fair
,
and
the
abbot
speak
no
word
,
nor
even
look
up
,
until
,
pass
Little
Mitton
,
he
come
in
sight
of

all
his
energy

the
shock

when
he
behold
the
stately
pile
,
once
his
own
,
now
go
from
him
and
his
for
ever
.
<EOS>
He
give
one
fond
glance
towards
it
,
and
then
painfully
avert
his
gaze
,
recite
,
in
a
low
voice
,
this
supplication:--
     
"

but
other
thought
and
other
emotion
crowd
upon
him
,
when
he
behold
the
group
of
his
old
retainer
advance
to
meet
him
:
man
,
woman
,
and
child
pour
forth
loud
lamentation
,
prostrate
themselves
at
his
foot
,
and
deplore
his
doom
.
<EOS>
the
abbot
's
fortitude
have
a
severe
trial
here
,
and
the
tear
spring
to
his
eye
.
<EOS>
the
devotion
of
these
poor
people
touch
him
more
sharply

the
severity

<EOS>
those

at

<EOS>
to
him
the
whole
scene
appear
like
a
vision

<EOS>
the
light
stream
from

--
the
incense
load
the
air
--
the
deep
diapason
roll
overhead
--
the
well
-
know
face
of
the
brother
--
the
familiar
aspect
of
the
sacred
edifice
--
all
these
fill
him
with
emotion
too
painful
almost
for
endurance
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
last
time
he
should
visit
this
holy
place
--
the
last
time
he
should
hear
those
solemn
sound
--
the
last
time
he
should
behold
those
familiar
object
--
ay
,
the
last
!
<EOS>
death
could
have
no
pang
like
this
!
<EOS>
and
with
heart
wellnigh
bursting
,
and
limb
scarcely
serve
their
office
,
he
totter
on
.
 
<EOS>
another
trial
await
him
,
and
one
for
which
he
be
wholly
unprepared
.
<EOS>
as
he
draw
near
the
chancel
,
he
look
down
an
opening
on
the
right
,
which
seem
purposely
preserve
by
the
guard
.
<EOS>
why
be
those
taper
burn
in
the
side
chapel
?
<EOS>
what
be
within
it
?
<EOS>
He
look
again
,
and
beheld
two
uncovered
bier
.
<EOS>
on
one
lay
the
body
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
He
start
.
<EOS>
in
the
beautiful
,
but
fierce
feature
of
the
dead
,
he
behold
the
witch
,
Bess
Demdike

<EOS>
She
be
go
to
her

<EOS>
the
malediction
he
have

upon
her
child
have
kill
her
.
 
<EOS>
appal
,
he
turn
to
the
other
bi
,
and
recognise
Cuthbert
Ashbead
.
<EOS>
He
shudder
,
but
comfort
himself
that
he
be
at
least
guiltless
of
his
death
;
though
he
have
a
strange
feeling
that
the
poor
forester
have
in
some
way
perish
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
attention
be
divert
towards
a
tall
monk
in
the
cistertian
habit
,
stand
between
the
body
,
with
the
cowl
draw
over
his
face
.
<EOS>
as
Paslew
gaze
at
him
,
the
monk
slowly
raise
his
hood
,
and
partially
disclose
feature
that
smote
the
abbot
as
if
he
have
behold
a
spectre
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
?
<EOS>
Could
fancy
cheat
him
thus
?
<EOS>
He
look
again
.
<EOS>
the
monk
be
still
stand
there
,
but
the
cowl
have
drop
over
his
face
.
<EOS>
strive
to
shake
off
the
horror
that
possess
him
,
the
abbot
stagger
forward
,
and
reach
the
presbytery
,
sink
upon
his
knee
.
 
<EOS>
the
ceremonial
then
commence
.
<EOS>
the
solemn
requiem
be
sing
by
the
choir
;
and
three
yet
live
hear
the
hymn
for
the
repose
of
their
soul
.
<EOS>
always
deeply
impressive
,
the
service
be
unusually
so
on
this
sad
occasion
,
and
the
melodious
voice
of
the
singer
never
sound
so
mournfully
sweet
as
then
--
<EOS>
the
demeanour
of
the
prior
never
seem
so
dignified
,
nor
his
accent
so
touching
and
solemn
.
<EOS>
the
sternest
heart
be
soften
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
abbot
find
it
impossible
to
fix
his
attention
on
the
service
.
<EOS>
the
light
at
the
altar
burn
dimly
in
his
eye
--
the
loud
antiphon
and
the
supplicatory
prayer
fall
upon
a
listless
ear
.
<EOS>
His
whole
life
be
pass
in
review
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
see
himself
as
he
be
when
he
first
profess
his
faith
,
and
feel
the
zeal
and
holy
aspiration
that
fill
him
then
.
<EOS>
year
fly
by
at
a
glance
,
and
he
find
himself
sub
-
deacon
;
the
sub
-
deacon
become
deacon
;
and
the
deacon
,
sub
-
prior
,
and
the
end
of
his
ambition
seem
plain
before
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
a
rival
;
his
fear
tell
him
a
superior
in
zeal
and
learning
:
one
who
,
though
many
year
young
than
he
,
have
rise
so
rapidly
in
favour
with
the
ecclesiastical
authority
,
that
he
threaten
to
outstrip
him
,
even
now
,
when
the
goal
be
full
in
view
.
<EOS>
the
dark
passage
of
his
life
approach
:
a
crime
which
should
cast
a
deep
shadow
over
the
whole
of
his
brilliant
after
-
career
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
shun
its
contemplation
,
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
in
vain
.
<EOS>
It
stand
out
more
palpably
than
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
His
rival
be
no
longer
in
his
path
.
<EOS>
how
he
be
remove
the
abbot
do
not
dare
to
think
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
go
for
ever
,
unless
the
tall
monk
be
he
!
 
<EOS>
unable
to
endure
this
terrible
retrospect
,
Paslew
strove
to
bend
his
thought
on
other
thing
.
<EOS>
the
choir
be
singe
the
"
_

,
"
and
their
voice
thunder
forth:--

<EOS>
Qui

salvas
gratis

Salva

<EOS>
Fain
would
the
abbot
have
close
his
ear
,
and
,
hope
to
stifle
the
remorseful
pang
that
seize
upon
his
very
vital
with
the
sharpness
of
serpent
'
tooth
,
he
strove
to
dwell
upon
the
frequent
and
severe
act
of
penance
he
have
perform
.
<EOS>
but
he
now
find
that
his
penitence
have
never
be
sincere
and
efficacious
.
<EOS>
this
one
damn
sin
obscure
all
his
good
action
;
and
he
feel
if
he
die
unconfessed
,
and
with
the
weight
of
guilt
upon
his
soul
,
he
should
perish
everlastingly
.
<EOS>
again
he
flee
from
the
torment
of
retrospection
,
and
again
hear
the
choir
thunder
forth--

"

"
 
<EOS>
then
he
look
up

and
resolve
to
ask
for
a

unburthen
his
soul
without

I

I

a

myself

ear
to
me

I

when
first
shut
within

dungeon

I
yield

the
prompting

despair

<EOS>
curse
you

I
throw
myself
upon

soon
release

love
of
life
prevail

<EOS>
on
the
second
day
I
take
the
bread
and
water
allot
me
,
and
eat
and
drank
;
after
which
I
scale
the
narrow
staircase
,
and
gaze
through
the
thin
bar
loophole
at
the
bright
blue
sky
above
,
sometimes
catch
the
shadow
of
a
bird
as
it
fly
past
.
<EOS>
oh
,
how
I
yearn
for
freedom
then
!
<EOS>
oh
,
how
I
wish
to
break
through
the
stone
wall
that
hold
me
fast
!
<EOS>
oh
,
what
a
weight
of
despair
crush
my
heart
as
I
creep
back
to
my
narrow
bed
!
<EOS>
the
cell
seem
like
a
grave
,
and
indeed
it
be
little
well
.
<EOS>
horrible
thought
possess
me
.
<EOS>
what
if
I
should
be
wilfully
forget
?
<EOS>
what
if
no
food
should
be
give
me
,
and
I
should
be
leave
to
perish
by
the
slow
pang
of
hunger
?
<EOS>
at
this
idea
I
shriek
aloud
,
but
the
wall
alone
return
a
dull
echo
to
my
cry
.
<EOS>
I
beat
my
hand
against
the
stone
,
till
the
blood
flow
from
them
,
but
no
answer
be
return
;
and
at

I
desist
from
sheer
exhaustion

<EOS>
day
after
day
,

night
after
night

pass
in
this
way

My
food
regularly
come

I
become
madden
by
solitude
;

with
terrible
imprecation
invoke
aid
from
the
power
of
darkness
to
set
me
free
.
<EOS>
one
night
,
while
thus
employ
,
I
be
startle
by
a
mock
voice
which
say
,
 
"

all
this
fury

needless

hast
only
to

"
It
be
profoundly
dark
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
nothing
but
a
pair
of
red
orb
,
glow
like
flaming
carbuncle
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Thou
wouldst
be
free

Thou

be
so

,
and
follow
me

'
 
<EOS>
"
at
this
I
feel
myself
grasp
by
an
iron
arm
,
against
which
all
resistance
would
have
be
unavaile
,
even
if
I
have
dare
to
offer
it
,
and
in
an
instant
I
be
drag
up
the
narrow
step
.
<EOS>
the
stone
wall
open
before
my
unseen
conductor
,
and
in
another
moment
we
be
upon
the
roof
of
the
dormitory
.
<EOS>
by
the
bright
starbeam
shoot
down
from
above
,
I
discern
a
tall
shadowy
figure
stand
by
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Thou
art
mine
,
'
he
cry
,
in
accent
grave
for
ever
on
my
memory
;
'
but
I
be
a
generous
master
,
and
will
give
thee
a
long
term
of
freedom
.
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
be
avenge
upon
thine
enemy
--
deeply
avenged
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
grant
this
,
and
I
be
thine
,
'
I
reply
,
a
spirit
of
infernal
vengeance
possess
me
.
<EOS>
and
I
knelt
before
the
fiend
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
but
thou
must
tarry
for
awhile
,
'
he
answer
,
'
for
thine
enemy
's
time
will
be
long
in
come
;
but
it
_
will
_
come
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
work
him
immediate
harm
;
but
I
will
lead
him
to
a
height
from
which
he
will
assuredly
fall
headlong
.
<EOS>
Thou
must
depart
from
this
place
;
for
it
be
perilous
to
thee
,
and
if
thou
stay
here
,
ill
will
befall
thee
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
a
rat
to
thy
dungeon
,
which
shall
daily
devour
the
provision
,
so
that
the
monk
shall
not
know
thou
hast
flee
.
<EOS>
in
thirty
and
one
year
shall
the
abbot
's
doom
be
accomplish
.
<EOS>
two
year
before
that
time
thou
mayst
return
.
<EOS>
then
come
alone
to
Pendle
Hill
on
a
Friday
night
,
and
beat
the
water
of
the
moss
pool
on
the
summit
,

I
will
appear
to
thee

tell
thee
more

and
twenty
year

<EOS>
"
with
these
word
the
shadowy
figure
melt
away
,
and
I
find
myself
stand
alone
on
the
mossy
roof
of
the
dormitory
.
<EOS>
the
cold
star
be
shine
down
upon
me
,
and
I
hear
the
howl
of
the
watch
-
dog
near
the
gate
.
<EOS>
the
fair
abbey
sleep
in
beauty
around
me

I
gnash
my
tooth
with
rage
to
think
that
you
have
make
me
an
outcast
from
it
,
and
rob
me
of
a
dignity
which
may
have
be
mine
.
<EOS>
I
be
wroth
also
that
my
vengeance
should
be
so
long
delay
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
remain
where
I
be
,
so
I
clamber
down
the
buttress
,
and
flee
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
this
be
?
<EOS>
"
cry
the
abbot
,
who
have
listen
in
rapt
wonderment
to
the
narration
.
<EOS>
"
two
year
after
your
immurement
in

cell

the
food
have
be
for
some
time
untouched

the
wall

open

upon

pallet

find
a

carcase

monkish
vestment

It

from

monk

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
my
long
wandering
in
other
land

beneath
bright
sky
I
need
not
tell
you
;
but
neither
absence
nor
lapse
of
year
cool
my
desire
of
vengeance
,
and
when
the
appoint
time
draw
nigh
<EOS>
I
return
to
my
own
country

come
hither
in
a
lowly
garb

under

Nicholas
Demdike

the
Dark
Shape
there
as
I
beheld
it
on
the
dormitory
roof

<EOS>
all
thing
be
then
tell
me
,
and
I
learn
how
the
late
rebellion
should
rise
,
and
how
it
should
be
crush

<EOS>
I
learn
also
how
my
vengeance
should
be
satisfied

"
 
<EOS>
Paslew
groan
aloud
.
<EOS>
a
brief
pause
ensue
,
and
deep
emotion
mark
the
accent
of
the
wizard
as
he
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
I
come
back
,
all
this
part
of
Lancashire
resound
with
praise
of
the
beauty
of
Bess
Blackburn
,
a
rustic
lass
who
dwelt
in
Barrowford
.
<EOS>
She
be
call
the
Flower
of
Pendle

and
inflame
all
the
youth
with
love
,
and
all
the
maiden
with
jealousy
.
<EOS>
but
she
favour
none
except
Cuthbert
Ashbead
,
forester
to
the
Abbot
of
Whalley
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
would
fain
have
give
her
to
the
forester
in
marriage
,
but
Bess
would
not
be
dispose
of
so
easily
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
,
and
become
at
once
enamour
.
<EOS>
I
think
my
heart
be
sear
;
but
it
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
the
savage
beauty
of
Bess
please
me
more
than
the
most
refined
charm
could
have
do
,
and
her
fierce
character
harmonise
with
my
own
.
<EOS>
how
I
win
her
matter
not
,
but
she
cast
off
all
thought
of
Ashbead
,
and
clung
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
wild
life
suit
her
;
and
she
roam
the
waste
with
me
,
scale
the
hill
in
my
company
,
and
shrink
not
from
the
weird
meeting
I
attend
.
<EOS>
Ill
repute
quickly
attend
her
,
and
she
become
brand
as
a
witch
.
<EOS>
Her
aged
mother
close
her
door
upon
her
,
and
those
who
would
have
go
mile
to
meet
her
,
now
avoid
her
.
<EOS>
Bess
heed
this
little
.
<EOS>
She
be
of
a
nature
to
repay
the
world
be
contumely
with
like
scorn
,
but
when
her
child
be
bear
the
case
become
different

<EOS>
She
wish
to
save
it

<EOS>
then
it
be

pursue
Demdike
,
vehemently
,
and
regard
the
abbot
with
flashing
<EOS>
eyes--"then
<EOS>
it
be
that
I

then

"
you

"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
long
,
fearful
silence

<EOS>
at
last
Demdike
advanced
to
the
abbot
,
and
,
seize
his
arm
,
fix
his
eye
upon
him

as
if
to
search
into

<EOS>
Can
that
malediction

<EOS>
dare
not
to
trifle
with
me
,
or
I
will
tear
forth
your

<EOS>
"
It

reply
the
abbot

half
dead
with
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
away
,
then

"
thunder
Demdike
,
cast
him
from
him

at

<EOS>
but
it
be
long
before
the
tumult
of

<EOS>
presently
,

stealthily
approach
him
,
and
almost
hope

<EOS>
but
he
be
quickly
undeceived

three

four

much

by

the
fresh

have
make
some
slight
preparation
,

let

down
into

stream

at
this
moment
a
loud
crash
be
hear
,

one
of

man
cry
out
that

have
burst
open

cry
Hal

who
have
some
difficulty
in
maintain
his
footing
on
the
rough
,
stony
bottom
of
the
swift
stream
.
 
<EOS>
passively
yield
,
the
abbot
suffer
the
miller
and
one
of
the
stout
of
his
man
to
assist
him
through
the
trapdoor
,
while
a
third
hold
down
the
lamp
,
and
show
Hal

up
to

middle
in

burden

<EOS>
the

fall
upon
the

black
circle
of
the
watershed
now
stop
,

upon
the
dripping
arch
support
the
mill

<EOS>
in
another
moment
the
abbot
plunge
into
the
water
,
the
trapdoor
be
replace
,
and
bolt
underneath
by

who
,
while
guide
his
companion
along
,
and
bid
him
catch
hold
of
the
wood

work
of

wheel
,
hear
a
heavy
trampling
of
many
foot
on

board

show
that
the
pursuer
have
obtain
admittance
.
 
<EOS>
encumber
by
his
heavy
vestment
,
the
abbot
could
with
difficulty
contend
against
the
strong
current
,
and
he
momently
expect
to
be
sweep
away
;
but
he
have
a
stout
and
active
assistant
by
his
side
,
who
soon
place
him
under
shelter
of
the
wheel
.
<EOS>
the
trample
overhead
continue
for
a
few
minute
,
after
which
all
be
quiet
,
and
Hal
judge
that
,
find
their
search
within
ineffectual
,
the
enemy
would
speedily
come
forth
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
deceive
.
<EOS>
shout
be
soon
hear
at
the
door
of
the
mill
,
and
the
glare
of
torch
be
cast
on
the
stream
.
<EOS>
then
it
be
that
Hal
drag
his
companion
into
a
deep
hole
,
form
by
some
decay
in
the
masonry
,
behind
the
wheel
,
where
the
water
rise
nearly
to
their
chin
,
and
where
they
be
completely
conceal
.
<EOS>
scarcely
be
they
thus
ensconce
,
than
two
or
three
armed
man
,
hold
torch
aloft
,
be
see
wade
under
the
archway
;
but
after
look
carefully
around
,
and
even
approach
close
to
the
water
-
wheel
,
these
person
could
detect
nothing
,
and
withdraw
,
mutter
curse
of
rage
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
the
light
almost
wholly
disappear
,
and
the
shout
become
fainter
and
more
distant
,
it
be
evident
that
the
man
have
go
low
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
upon
this
,
Hal
think
they
may
venture
to
quit
their
retreat
,
and
accordingly
,
grasp
the
abbot
's
arm
,
he
proceed
to
wade
up
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
benumb
with
cold
,
and
half
dead
with
terror
,
Paslew
need
all
his
companion
's
support
,
for
he
could
do
little
to
help
himself
,
add
to
which
,
they
occasionally
encounter
some
large
stone
,
or
step
into
a
deep
hole
,
so
that
it
require
Hal
's
utmost
exertion
and
strength
to
force
a
way
on
.
<EOS>
at
last
they
be
out
of
the
arch
,
and
though
both
bank
seem

,
for
fear
of
surprise
,
Hal
deem
it
prudent
still
to
keep
to
the
river
.
<EOS>
Their
course
be
completely
shelter
from
observation
by
the
mist
that
envelop
them
;
and
after
proceed
in
this
way
for
some
distance
,
Hal
stop
to
listen
,
and
while
debate
with
himself
whether
he
should
now
quit
the
river
,
he
fancy
he
behold
a
black
object
swim
towards
him
.
<EOS>
take
it
for
an
otter
,
with
which
voracious
animal
the
Calder
,
a
stream
swarm
with
trout
,
abound
,
and
know
the
creature
would
not
meddle
with
them
unless
first
attack

he
pay
little
attention
to
it

but
he
be
soon
make
sensible
of
his
error

<EOS>
His
arm
be
suddenly

by
a
large
black
hound

whose
sharp
fang
meet
in
his
flesh

<EOS>
unable
to
repress
a
cry
of
pain
,
Hal
strove
to
disengage
himself
from
his
assailant
,
and
,
find
it
impossible
,
fling
himself
into
the
water
in
the
hope
of
drown
him
,
but
,
as
the
hound
still
maintain
his
hold
,
he
search
for
his
knife
to
slay
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
find
it
,
and
in
his
distress
apply
to

CHAPTER
viii.--the
EXECUTIONER
.
  
<EOS>
Dawn
come
at
last
,
after
a
long
and
weary
night
to
many
within
and
without
the
abbey
.
<EOS>
every
thing
betoken
a
dismal
day
.
<EOS>
the
atmosphere
be
damp
,
and
oppressive
to
the
spirit
,
while
the
raw
cold
sensibly
affect
the
frame
.
<EOS>
all
astir
be
fill
with
gloom
and
despondency
,
and
secretly
breathe
a
wish
that
,
the
tragical
business
of
the
day
be
end
.
<EOS>
the
vast
range
of
Pendle
be
obscure
by
cloud
,
and
ere
long
the
vapour
descend
into
the
valley
,
and
rain
begin
to
fall
;
at
first
slightly
,
but
afterwards
in
heavy
continuous
shower
.
<EOS>
Melancholy
be
the
aspect
of
the
abbey
,
and
it
require
no
stretch
of
imagination
to
fancy
that
the
old
structure
be
deplore
the
fate
of
its
former
ruler
.
<EOS>
to
those
impressed
with
the
idea
--
and
many
there
be
who
be
so
--
<EOS>
the
very
stone
of
the
convent
church
seem
dissolve
into
tear
.
<EOS>
the
statue
of
the
saint
appear
to
weep
,
and
the
great
statue
of
Saint
Gregory
de
Northbury
over
the
porch
seem
bow
down
with
grief
.
<EOS>
the
grotesquely
carve
head
on
the
spout
grin
horribly
at
the
abbot
's
destroyer
,
and
spout
forth
cascade
of
water
,
as
if
with
the
intent
of
drown
them
.
<EOS>
so
deluging
and
incessant
be
the
shower
,
that
it
seem
,
indeed
,
as
if
the
abbey
would
be
flood
.
<EOS>
all
the
inequality
of
ground
within
the
great
quadrangle
of
the
cloister
look
like
pond
,
and
the
various
water
-
spout
from
the
dormitory
,
the
refectory
,
and
the
chapter
-
house
,
continue
to
jet
forth
stream
into
the
court
below
,
the
ambulatory
be
soon
fill
ankle
-
deep
,
and
even
the
low
apartment
,
on
which
they
open
,
invade
.
 
<EOS>
surcharge
with
moisture
,
the
royal
banner
on
the
gate
droop
and
cling
to
the
staff
,
as
if
it
too
share
in
the
general
depression
,
or
as
if
the
sovereign
authority
it
represent
have
give
way
.
<EOS>
the
countenance
and
deportment
of
the
man
harmonize
with
the
weather
;
they
move
about
gloomily
and
despondently
,
their
bright
accoutrement
sully
with
the
wet
,
and
their
buskin
clog
with
mire
.
<EOS>
a
forlorn
sight
<EOS>
it
be
to
watch
the
shivering
sentinel
on
the
wall
;
and
yet
more
forlorn
to
see
the
group
of
the
abbot
's
old
retainer
gather
without
,
wrap
in
their
blue
woollen
cloak
,
patiently
endure
the
drench
shower
,
and
await
the
last
awful
scene
.
<EOS>
but
the
sad
sight
of
all
be
on
the
hill
,
already
describe
,
call
the
Holehouses

they

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
Father

since
the

a

Wiswall
Hall
,
a
great
gloomy
stone
mansion
,
situate
at
the
foot
of
the
south
-
western
side
of
Pendle
Hill
,
where
his
brother
Francis
still
reside
.
<EOS>
of
a
cold
and
cautious
character
,
Francis
Paslew
,
second
of
the
name
,
hold
aloof
from
the
insurrection
,
and
when
his
brother
be
arrest
he
wholly
abandon
him
.
<EOS>
still
the
owner
of
Wiswall
have
not
altogether
escape
suspicion
,
and
it
be
probably
as
much
with
the
view
of
degrade
him
as
of
add
to
the
abbot
's
punishment
,
that
the
latter
be
take
to
the
hall
on
the
morning
of
his
execution
.
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
the
cortège
toil
thither
through
road
bad
in
the
good
of
season
,
but
now
,
since
the
heavy
rain
,
scarcely
passable
;
and
it
arrive
there
in
about
half
an
hour
,
and
draw
up
on
the
broad
green
lawn
.
<EOS>
window
and
door
of
the
hall
be
closed
;
<EOS>
no
smoke
issue
from
the
heavy
pile
of
chimney
;
and
to
all
outward
seem
the
place
be
utterly
desert
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
inquiry
,
it
appear
that
Francis
Paslew
have
depart
for
Northumberland
on
the
previous
day
,
take
all
his
household
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
in
early
year
,
a
quarrel
have
occur
between
the
haughty
abbot
and
the
churlish
Francis
,
the
brother
rarely
meet
,
whence
it
chance
that
John
Paslew
have
seldom
visit
the
place
of
his
birth
of
late
,
though
lie
so
near
to
the
abbey
,
and
,
indeed
,
form
part
of
its
ancient
dependency
.
<EOS>
It
be
sad
to
view
it
now
;
and
yet
<EOS>
the
house
,
gloomy
as
it
be
,
recall
season
with
which
,
though
they
may
awaken
regret
,
no
guilty
association
be
connect
.
<EOS>
Dark
be
the
hall
,
and
desolate
,
but
on
the
fine
old
tree
around
it
the
rook
be
settle
,
and
their
loud
cawing
please
him
,
and
excited
gentle
emotion
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
he
grow
young
again
,
and
forget
why
he
be
there
.
<EOS>
fondly
survey
the
house
,
the
terrace
garden
,
in
which
,
as
a
boy
,
he
have
so
often
stray
,
and
the
park
beyond
it
,
where
he
have
chase
the
deer
;
his
gaze
rise
to
the
cloudy
height
of
Pendle
,
spring
immediately
behind
the
mansion
,
and
up
which
he
have
frequently
climb
.
<EOS>
the
flood
-
gate
of
memory
be
open
at
once
,
and
a
whole
tide
of
long
-
bury
feeling
rush
upon
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
half
-
painful
,
half
-
pleasurable
retrospect
he
be
arouse
by
the
loud
blast
of
a
trumpet
,
thrice
blown
.
<EOS>
a
recapitulation
of
his
offence
,
together
with
his
sentence
,
be
read
by
a
herald
,
after
which
the
reversed
blazonry
be
fasten
upon
the
door
of
the
hall
,
just
below
a
stone
escutcheon
on
which
be
carve
the
arm
of
the

;
while
the
paper

and
trample
under

,
the
lathen
crosier
break
in
twain
,
and
the
scurril

reply
Paslew
,
who
recognise
the
voice
of
Hal

and
hope
by
this
assertion
to
divert
him

<EOS>
at
this
moment

word

and
in
half
an
hour
the
cavalcade
arrive
at
the
abbey
in
the
same
order

it
have
leave
it

<EOS>
though
the
rain
have
cease
,
heavy
cloud
still
hang
overhead
,
threaten
another
deluge
,
and
the
aspect
of
the
abbey
remain
gloomy
as
ever
.
<EOS>
the
bell
continue
to
toll
;
drum
be
beat
;
and
trumpet
sound
from
the
outer
and
inner
gateway
,
and
from
the
three
quadrangle
.
<EOS>
the
cavalcade
draw
up
in
front
of
the
great
northern
entrance
;
and
its
return
be
announce
within
,
the
two
other
captive

bring
forth
,
each

upon
a
hurdle
,
harness
to
a
stout
horse

<EOS>
They
look
dead
already
,
so
ghastly

the
hue
of
their

come
next
.
<EOS>
another
hurdle
be

forward
,
and
Demdike
advance
to
the
tumbrel
.
<EOS>
but
Paslew
recoil
from
his
touch
,
and
spring
to
the
ground
unaided
.
<EOS>
He
be
then
lay
on
his
back
upon
the
hurdle
,
and
his
hand
and
foot
be
bind
fast
with
rope
to

<EOS>
while
this
painful
task

,
the
crowd
of
rustic
who
look
on
,
murmur
and
exhibit
such
strong
token
of
displeasure
,
that
the
guard
think
it
prudent
to
keep
them
off
with
their
halbert
.
<EOS>
but
when
all
be
do
,
Demdike
motion
to
a
man

behind
him
to
advance
,
and
the
person
who
be
wrap
in
a
russet
cloak
comply
,
draw
forth
an
infant
,
and
hold
it
in
such
way
that
the
abbot
could
see
it
.
<EOS>
Paslew
understand
what
be
mean
,
but
he
utter
not

<EOS>
demdike
then
knelt
down
beside

security
of

in

as

meekly

with
an
infuriate
gesture

CHAPTER

<EOS>
at
this
moment

blast
of

from
the
gateway

and

in
their
tabard

<EOS>
to
doleful
tolling
of
bell
--
to
solemn
music
--
to
plaintive
hymn
chant
by
monk
--
to
roll
of
muffled
drum
at
interval
--
the
sad
cortège
set
forth
.
<EOS>
loud
cry
from
the
bystander
mark
its
departure
,
and
some
of
them
follow
it
,
but
many
turn
away
,
unable
to
endure
the
sight
of
horror
about
to
ensue
.
<EOS>
amongst
those
who
go
on
be
Hal
o

<EOS>
Nabs
,
but
he
take
care
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
guard
,
though
he
be
little
likely
to
be
recognise
,
owe
to
his
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
despite
the
miserable
state
of
the
weather
,
a
great
multitude
be
assemble
at
the
place
of

and
they
watch

moody
curiosity

<EOS>

and
a
clear
course

<EOS>
but

and
yet
more
so
by
the
trampling
of
the
crowd
,
the
road
be
so
bad
in
place
that
the
horse
could
scarcely
drag
the
hurdle
up
it
,
and
more
than
one
delay
occur
.
<EOS>
the
stoppage
be
always
denounce
by
groan
,
yell
,
and
hooting
from
the
mob
,
and
these
neither
the
menace
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
nor
the
active
measure
of
the
guard
,
could
repress
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
the
cavalcade
reach
its
destination

<EOS>
then
the
crowd

"
 
<EOS>
"
My

and
up
this
Demdike
,
have
cast
off
his
houppeland
,

and
adjust
the
rope
.
<EOS>
His
tall
gaunt
figure
,
fully
display
in
his
tight
-
fitting
red
garb
,
make
him
look
like
a
hideous
scarecrow
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
be
greet
by
the
mob
with
a
perfect
hurricane
of
indignant
outcry
and
yell

<EOS>
but
he
heed
them
not

but
calmly
pursue
his
task
.
<EOS>
above
him

the
two
raven

who
have
never

the
place
since
daybreak

utter
their
discordant
cry

<EOS>
when
all

he
descend
a
few
step
,
and
,
take
a
black
hood
from
his
girdle
to
place
over
the
head
of
his
victim
,
call
out
in
a
voice
which
have
little

its
tone
,
"

John

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be

"
demand
the

<EOS>
"

and

,
"

It

"
I

with
this
he
mount
the
ladder
,
with
as
much
firmness
and
dignity
as
if

the
step
of

<EOS>
Hitherto
nothing

and
several

Hal

who
stand
on
the
outskirt
of

far
but
he

<EOS>
Hal

he
hurry

enter
it
,
the
door

and
rush
up
to
the
gallery
,
contrive
to
get
out
through
a
window
upon
the
top
of
the
porch
,
where
he
secrete
himself
behind
the
great
stone
statue
of
Saint
Gregory
.
 
<EOS>
the
information
he
have
obtain
prove
correct
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
a
mournful
train
approach
the
church
,
and
a
bi
be
set
down
before
the
porch
.
<EOS>
a
black
hood
cover
the
face
of
the
dead
,
but
the
vestment
show
that
it
be
the
body
of
Paslew
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
head
of
the
bearer
be
Demdike
,
and
when
the
body
be
set
down
he
advance
towards
it
,
and
,
remove
the
hood
,
gaze
at
the
livid
and
distorted
feature
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
length
I

"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
Abbot
Paslew
,
also
,
"
cry
a
voice
above
him
.
 
<EOS>
Demdike
look
up
,
but
the
look
be
his
last
,
for
the
ponderous
statue
of
Saint
Gregory
de
Northbury
,
launch
from
its
pedestal
,
fall
upon
his
head
,
and
crush
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
a
mangled
and
breathless
mass
be
take
from
beneath
the
image
,
and
the
hand
and
visage
of
Paslew
be
find
spot
with
blood
dash
from
the
gory
carcass
.
<EOS>
the
author
of
the
wizard
's
destruction
be
suspect
,
but
never
find
,
nor
be
it
positively
know
who
have
do
the
deed
till
year
after
,
when
Hal

Nabs
,
who
meanwhile
have
marry
pretty
Dorothy
Croft
,
and
have
be
bless
by
numerous
offspring
in
the
union
,
make
his
last
confession
,
and
then
he
exhibit
no
remarkable
or
become
penitence
for
the
act
,
neither
be
he
refuse
absolution
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
come
to
pass
that
the
abbot
and
his
enemy
perish
together
.
<EOS>
the
mutilated
remain
of
the
wizard
be
place
in
a
shell
,
and
huddle
into
the
grave
where
his
wife
have
that
morning
be
lay
.
<EOS>
but
no
prayer
be
say
over
him
.
<EOS>
and
the
superstitious
believe
that
the
body
be
carry
off
that
very
night
by
the
Fiend
,
and
take
to
a
witch
's
sabbath
in
the
ruined
tower
on
Rimington
Moor
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
that
the
unhallowed
grave
be
disturb
.
<EOS>
the
body
of
Paslew
be
decently
inter
in
the
north
aisle
of
the
parish
church
of
Whalley
,
beneath
a
stone
with
a
gothic
cross
sculpture
upon
it
,
and
bear
the
piteous
inscription:--"_miserere
mei
_
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
in
the
belief
of
the
vulgar
the
abbot
do
not
rest
tranquilly
.
<EOS>
for
many
year
afterwards
a
white
-
robe
monastic
figure
be
see
to
flit
along
the
cloister
,
pass
out
at
the
gate
,
and
disappear
with
a
wail
cry
over
the
Holehouses
.
<EOS>
and
the
same
ghostly
figure
be
often
see
to
glide
through
the
corridor
in
the
abbot
's
lodging
,
and
vanish
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
lead
to
the
little
oratory
.
<EOS>
thus
Whalley
Abbey
be
suppose
to
be
haunt
,
and
few
like
to
wander
through
its
desert
cloister
,
or
ruin
church
,
after
dark

<EOS>
the
abbot

tragical
end
be
thus
recorded:--

as
to
the
infant

upon
whom
the
abbot

malediction
fall
,
it
be
reserve
for
the
dark
destiny
shadow
forth

the
dread
anathema
he
have
utter
:
to
the
development
of
which
the
tragic

about
to
follow

devoted
,
and
to
which
the
fate
of
Abbot
Paslew
form
a
necessary
and
fitting
prologue

<EOS>
thus
far
the
veil
of

<EOS>
on
a
May

day
in
the
early
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
,
and
a
most
lovely
May
-
day
,
too
,
admirably
adapt
to
usher
in
the
merry
month
of
the
year
,
and
seemingly
make
expressly
for
the
occasion
,
a
wake
be
hold
at
Whalley
,
to
which
all
the
neighbour
country
folk
resort
,
and
indeed
many
of
the
gentry
as
well
,
for
in
the
good
old
time
,
when
England
be
still
merry
England
,
a
wake
have
attraction
for
all
class
alike
,
and
especially
in
Lancashire
;
for
,
with
pride
I
speak
it
,
there
be
no
lad
who
,
in
run
,
vaulting
,
wrestling
,
dancing
,
or
in
any
other
manly
exercise
,
could
compare
with
the
Lancashire
lad
.
<EOS>
in
archery
,
above
all
,
none
could
match
them
;
for
be
not
their
ancestor
the
stout
bowman
and
billman
whose
cloth
-
yard
shaft
,
and
trenchant
weapon
,
win
the
day
at
Flodden
?
<EOS>
and
be
they
not
true
son
of
their
father
?
<EOS>
and
then
,
I
speak
it
with
yet
great
pride
<EOS>
,
there
be
few
,
if
any
,
lass
who
could
compare
in
comeliness
with
the
rosy

cheek
,
dark
-
haired
,
bright

lass
of
Lancashire

<EOS>
assemblage
of
this
kind
,
therefore
,
where
the
good
specimen
of
either
sex
be
to
be
meet
with
,
be
sure
to
be
well
attend
,
and
in

of
an

in

prohibit

,
or
on
any

,
and
also
superstitious
ringing
of
bell
,
wake
,
and
common
feast
,
"
they
be
not
only
not
interfere
with
,
but
rather
encourage
by
the
high
order
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
well
know
that
the
reign
monarch
,
James
the
First
,
incline
the
other
way
,
and
,
desirous
of
check
the
grow
spirit
of
Puritanism
throughout
the
kingdom
,
have
openly
express
himself
in
favour
of
honest
recreation
after
evening
prayer
and
upon
holiday
;
and
,
furthermore
,
have
declare
that
he
like
well
the
spirit
of
his
good
subject
in
Lancashire
,
and
would
not
see
them
punish
for
indulge
in
lawful
exercise
,
but
that
ere
long
he
would
pay
them
a
visit
in
one
of
his
progress
,
and
judge
for
himself
,
and
if
he
find
all
thing
as
they
have
be
represent
to
him
,
he
would
grant
them
still
further
licence
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
this
expression
of
the
royal
opinion
remove
every
restriction

,
and

,
be
as
much
practise
as
before
the
passing
of
the
obnoxious
enactment
of
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
the
Puritans
and
Precisians
discountenance
them
,
it
be
true
,
as
much
as
ever
,
and
would
have
put
them
down
,
if
they
could
,
as
savouring
of
papistry
and
idolatry
,
and
some
rigid
divine
thunder
against
them
from
the
pulpit
;
but
with
the
king
and
the
authority
in
their
favour
,
the
people
little
heed
these
denunciation
against
them
,
and
abstain
not
from
any
"
honest
recreation
"
whenever
a
holiday
occur
.
 
<EOS>
if
Lancashire
be
famous
for
wake
,
the
wake
of
Whalley
be
famous
even
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
the
man
of
the

be
in
general
a
hardy
,
handsome
race
,
of
the
genuine
Saxon
breed
,
and
passionately
fond
of
all
kind
of
pastime
,
and
the
woman
have
their
full
share
of
the
beauty
indigenous
to

<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
a
secluded
spot
,
in
the
heart
of
a
wild
mountainous
region

and
though
occasionally

by
traveller
journey
northward
,
or
by
other
come
from
the
opposite
direction
,
retain
a
primitive
simplicity
of
manner
,
and
a
great
partiality
for
old
custom
and
habit
.
 
<EOS>
the
natural
beauty
of
the
place
,
contrast
with
the
dreary
region
around
it

and
heighten
by
the
picturesque
ruin
of
the
ancient

part
of
which

namely

but
when
on

in

there
be

soon

<EOS>
this
morning
ceremonial
ought
to
have

without

but
though
some

few
could
achieve
the

on

<EOS>
Day
be
usher
in
by
a
merry
peal
of
bell
from
the
tower
of
the
old
parish
church
,
and
the
ringer
practise
all
kind
of
joyous
change
during
the
morning
,
and
fire
many
a
clanging
volley

<EOS>
the
whole
village
be
early
astir
;
and
as
these
be
time
when
good
hour

keep

and
as
early
rise
be
a
famous
sharpener
of
the
appetite

so
an
hour
before
noon
the

general
hospitality
.
<EOS>
the
alehouse
be
reserve

male
as
well
as
female
,
as
will
be
more
fully

to

<EOS>
private
chamber
be
,
of
course
,
reserve
for
the
gentry
;
but
not
unfrequently
the
squire
and
his
friend
would
take
their
bottle
with
the
other
guest
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
invariable
practice
in
the
northern
county
in
the
reign
of
James
the
First

<EOS>
soon
after
mid

day

and
when

merrily
again
(

small

then
about

<EOS>
and
,
certainly
,
by
sovereign

prescriptive
right

no
one
better
deserve
the
high

distinction
confer
upon
her

this
fair

<EOS>
lovelier
maiden
in
the
whole
county

and
however
high
her
degree
,
than
this
rustic
damsel
<EOS>
,
it
be
impossible
to
find
;
and
though
the
becoming
and
fanciful
costume
in
which
she
be
deck
could
not
heighten
her
natural
charm
,
it
certainly
display
them
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
upon
her
smooth

<EOS>
slight
and
fragile

her
figure
be
of
such
just
proportion
that
every
movement

gesture
have
an
indescribable
charm

<EOS>
the
most
courtly
dame
may
have
envy
her
fine
and
taper
finger
,
and
fancy
she
could
improve
them
by
protect
them
against
the
sun
,
or
by
render
them
snowy
white
with
paste
or
cosmetic
,
but
this
be
questionable
;
nothing
certainly
could
improve
the
small
foot
and
finely

so
well
display
in
the
red

and
smart

Her
robe

colour
silk

with
wide
sleeve
,
and
the
gold

fringe
skirt
descend
only
a
little

the
knee
,
like
the
dress
of
a
modern
swiss
peasant
,
so
as
to
reveal
the
exquisite
symmetry
of
her
limb
.
<EOS>
over
all
she
wear
a
surcoat

azure
silk

line
with

the

the
eager

envious
interest
she
take
in
the

crimson
circle
round
them
!
<EOS>
so
think
the
little
girl
,
as
she
gaze
at
it
,
and
press
it
to
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
in
do
this
,
gentle
and
good
thought
come
upon
her
,
and
she
reflect
what
a
nice
present
this
pretty
bird
would
make
to
her
sister
Alizon
on
her
return
from
the
merry
-
making
,
and
how
pleased
she
should
feel
to
give
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
think
of
Alizon
's
constant
kindness
to
her
,
and
half
reproach
herself
with
the
poor
return
she
make
for
it
,
wonder
she
could
entertain
any
feeling
of
envy
towards
one
so
good
and
amiable
.
<EOS>
all
this
while
the
dove
nestle
in
her
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
while
thus
ponder
,
the
little
girl
feel
an
unaccountable
drowsiness
steal
over
her
,
and
presently
afterwards
drop
asleep
,
when
she
have
a
very
strange
dream
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
her
that
there
be
a
contest
go
on
between
two
spirit
,
a
good
one
and
a
bad,--the
bad
one
be
represent
by
the
great
black
cat
,
and
the
good
spirit
by
the
white
dove
.
<EOS>
what
they
be
strive
about
she
could
not
exactly
tell
,
but
she
feel
that
the
conflict
have
some
relation
to
herself
.
<EOS>
the
dove
at
first
appear
to
have
but
a
poor
chance
against
the
claws
of
its
sable
adversary
,
but
the
sharp
talon
of
the
latter
make
no
impression
upon
the
white
plumage
of
the
bird
,
which
now
shine
like
silver
armour
,
and
in
the
end
the
cat
flee
,
yell
as
it
dart
off--"Thou
art
victorious
now
,
but
her
soul
shall
yet
be
mine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
something
awaken
the
little
sleeper
at
the
same
moment
,
and
she
feel
very
much
terrified
at
her
dream
,
as
she
could
not
help
think
her
own
soul
may
be
the
one
in
jeopardy
,
and
her
first
impulse
be
to
see
whether
the
white
dove
be
safe
.
<EOS>
yes
,
there
it
be
still
nestle
in
her
bosom
,
with
its
head
under
its
wing
.
 
<EOS>
just
then
she
be
startle
at

her
own

<EOS>
between
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
of
the
Abbey
and
the
inhabitant
of
Whalley
,
many
of
whom
be
his
tenant
,
he
be
joint
lord
of
the
manor
with
John
Braddyll
of
Portfield
,
the
good
possible
feeling
subsist
;
for
though
somewhat
austere
in
manner
,
and
tincture
with
Puritanism
,
the
worthy
knight
be
sufficiently
shrewd
,
or
,
more
correctly
speak
,
<EOS>
sufficiently
liberal
-
minded
,
to
be
tolerant
of
the
opinion
of
other
,
and
be
moreover
sincere
in
his
own
religious
view
,
no
man
could
call
him
in
question
for
them
;
besides
which
,
he
be
very
hospitable
to
his
friend
,
very
bountiful
to
the
poor
,
a
good
landlord
,
and
a
humane
man
.
<EOS>
His
very
austerity
of
manner
,
temper
by
stately
courtesy
,
add
to
the
respect
he
inspire
,
especially
as
he
could
now
and
then
relax
into
gaiety
,
and
,
when
he
do
so
,
his
smile
be
account
singularly
sweet
.
<EOS>
but
in
general
he
be
grave
and
formal
;
stiff
in
attire
,
and
stiff
in
gait
;
cold
and
punctilious
in
manner
,
precise
in
speech
,
and
exact
in

refuse
him

other
good
quality
,
for
such
it

esteem
by
his
friend
and
retainer
,
and
they
be
,
of
course
,
the
good
judge
,
be
a
strong
love
of
the
chase
,
and
perhaps
he
indulge
a
little
too
freely
in
the
sport
of
the
field
,
for
a
gentleman
of
a
character
so
staid
and
decorous
;
but
his
popularity
be
far
from
be
diminish
by
the
circumstance
;
neither
do
he
suffer
the
rude
and
boisterous
companionship
into
which
he
be
bring
by
indulgence
in
this
his
favourite
pursuit
in
any
way
to
affect
him

sad
severity
of
his
aspect
,
give
him
the
air
of
one
considerably
past
the
middle
term
of

a
very
different
person
from
Sir
Ralph
be
his
cousin
,
Nicholas
Assheton
of
Downham
,
who
,
except
as
regard
his
Puritanism
,
may
be
consider
a
type
of
the
Lancashire
squire
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
a
precisian
in
religious
notion
,
and
constant
in
attendance
at
church
and
lecture
,
he
put
no
sort
of
restraint
upon
himself
,
but
mix
up
fox
-
hunting
,
otter
-
hunting
,
shoot
at
the
mark
,
and
perhaps
shoot
with
the
long
-
bow
,
foot
-
racing
,
horse
-
racing
,
and
,
in
fact
,
every
other
kind
of
country
diversion
,
not
forget
tipple
,
card
,
and
dicing
,
with
daily
devotion
,
discourse
,
and
psalm
-
singing
in
the
oddest
way
imaginable
.
<EOS>
a
thorough
sportsman
be
Squire
Nicholas
Assheton
,
well
verse
in
all
the
art
and
mystery
of
hawking
and
hunting
.
<EOS>
not
a
man
in
the
county
could
ride
harder
,
hunt
deer
,
unkennel
fox
,
unearth
badger
,
or
spear
otter
,
well
than
he
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
to
tipple
,
he
would
sit
you
a
whole
afternoon
at
the
alehouse
,
and
be
the
merry
man
there
,
and
drink
a
bout
with
every
farmer
present
.
<EOS>
and
if
the
parson
chance
to
be
out
of
hearing
,
he
would
never
make
a
mouth
at
a
round
oath
,
nor
choose
a
second
expression
when
the
first
would
serve
his
turn
.
<EOS>
then
,
who
so
constant

surprising
manner

daily
duty
over
his

him
the
roundhead
look
,
some
year

more
than

<EOS>
a
proud
poor

Richard

her
late

and
his
scanty

<EOS>
during

many
reputed
witch
dwell
in
it

they
be
the
more
readily

<EOS>
Mistress

<EOS>
though
a

to
all
that
she
have

seclusion
to

present
revel

<EOS>
Her
motive

CHAPTER
IV.--ALICE
NUTTER
.
  
<EOS>
the
quarrel
between
Nicholas
Assheton
and
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
have
already
be
make
known
to
Sir
Ralph
by
the
officious
Master
Potts
,
and
though
it
occasion
the
knight
much
displeasure
;
as
interfere
with
the
amicable
arrangement
he
hope
to
effect
with
Sir
Thomas
for
his
relative
the
Robinsons
,
still
he
feel
sure
that
he
have
sufficient
influence
with
his
hot
-
headed
cousin
,
the
squire
,
to
prevent
the
dispute
from
be
carry
further
,
and
he
only
wait
the
conclusion
of
the
sport
on
the
green
,
to
take
him
to
task
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
knight
's
surprise
and
annoyance
,
therefore
,
to
find
that
a
new
brawl
have
spring
up
,
and
,
ignorant
of
its
precise
cause
,
he
lay
it
entirely
at
the
door
of
the
turbulent
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
on
the
commencement
of
the
fray
he
imagine
that
the
squire
be
personally
concerned
in
it
,
and
full
of
wroth
,
fly
to
the
scene
of
action
;
but
before
he
get
there
,
the
affair
,
which
,
as
have
be
see
,
be
of
short
duration
,
be
fully
settle
,
and
<EOS>
he
only
hear
the
jeer
address
to
the
retreat
combatant
by
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
Sir
Ralph
's
way
to
vent
his
choler
in
word
,
but
the
squire
know
in
an
instant
,
from
the
expression
of
his
countenance
,
that
he
be
greatly
incensed
,
and
therefore
hasten
to
explain
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
mean
this
unseemly
disturbance
,
Nicholas
?
"
cry
Sir
Ralph
,
not
allow
the
other
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
ever
brawl
like
an
alsatian
squire
.
<EOS>
independently
of
the
ill
example
set
to
these
good
folk
,
who
have
meet
here
for
tranquil
amusement
,
you
have
counteract
all
my
plan
for
the
adjustment
of
the
difference
between
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
and
our
aunt
of
Raydale
.
<EOS>
if
you
forget
what
be
due
to
yourself
,
sir
,
do
not
forget
what
be
due
to
me

and
to
the
name
you
bear

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no

yourself
should
say
as
much
to
me
,
Sir
Ralph

"
rejoin
Nicholas
somewhat
haughtily
;
"
but
you
be
under
a
misapprehension
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
I
who
have

though
I
should
have
act
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
our
cousin
Dick
,
if
I
have
receive
the
same
affront
,
and
so
I
make
bold
to
say
would
you
.
<EOS>
Our
name
shall
suffer
no
discredit
from
me
;
and
as
a
gentleman
,
I
assert
,
that
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
have
only
receive
due
chastisement
,
as
you
yourself
will
admit
,
cousin
,
when
you
know
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
him
to
be
overbear
,
"
observe
Sir
Ralph
.
 
<EOS>
"
overbearing
be
not
the
word
,
cousin
,
"
interrupt
Nicholas
;
"
he
be
as
proud
as
a
peacock
,
and
would
trample
upon
us
all
,
and
gore
us
too
,
like
one
of
the
wild
bull
of
Bowland
,
if
we
would
let
him
have
his
way
.
<EOS>
but
I
would
treat
him
as
I
would
the
bull
aforesaid
,
a
wild
boar
,
or
any
other
savage
and
intractable
beast
,
hunt
him
down
,
and
poll
his
horn
,
or
pluck
out
his
tusk
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
Nicholas
,
this
be
no
very
gentle
language
,
"
remark
Sir
Ralph
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
to
speak
truth
,
cousin
,
I
do
not
feel
in
any
very
gentle
frame
of
mind

"
rejoin
the
squire
;
"
my
ire
have
be
rouse
by
this
insolent
braggart

my
blood

up

I
long

"
 
<EOS>
"
unchristian
feeling

Nicholas

say
Sir
Ralph
,
severely
,
"

should
be
overcome

<EOS>
turn
the
other
cheek
to
the
smiter
.
<EOS>
I
trust
you
bear
no
malice
to
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
bear
him
no
malice
,
for
I
hope
malice
be
not
in
my
nature

cousin

"
reply
Nicholas
,
"

I
owe
him
a
grudge
,

when
a
fitting
opportunity
occurs--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
more
of
this
,

you
would
really
incur
my
displeasure
,
"
rejoin
Sir
Ralph
;
"
the
matter
have
go
far
enough
,
too
far
,
perhaps
for
amendment
,
and
if
you
know
it
not
,
I
can
tell
you
that
Sir
Thomas
's
claim
to
Raydale
will
be
difficult
to
dispute
,
and
<EOS>
so
our
uncle
Robinson
have
find
since
he
hath
take
counsel
on
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
have
a
care
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
notice
that
Master
Potts
be
approach
them
,
with
his
ear
evidently
wide
open
,
"
there
be
that
little
London
lawyer
hover
about
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
give
the
cunne
fox
a
double
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
he
add
,
in
a
tone
calculate
to
reach
Potts
,
"
and
since
our
uncle
Robinson
be
so
sure
of
his
cause
,
it
may
be
well
to
let
this
blustering
knight
be
.
<EOS>
perchance
,
it
be
the
certainty
of
failure
that
make
him
so
insensate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
mean
to
blind
me
,
but
it
shall
not
serve
your
turn
,
cautelous
squire
,
"
muttered
Potts
;
"
I
catch
enough
of
what
fall
just
now
from
Sir
Ralph
to
satisfy
me
that
he
hath
strong
misgiving
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
good
not
to
appear
too
secure.--ah
,
Sir
Ralph
,
"
he
add
,
come
forward
,
"
I
be
right
,
you
see
,
in
my
caution
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
man
of
peace
,
and
strive
to
prevent
quarrel
and
bloodshed
.
<EOS>
Quarrel
if
you
please
--
and
unfortunately
man
be
prone
to
anger
--
but
always
settle
your
dispute
in
a
court
of
law
;
always
in
a
court
of
law
,
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
only
arena
where
a
sensible
man
should
ever
fight
.
<EOS>
take
good
advice
,
fee
your
counsel
well
,
and
the
chance
be
ten
to
one
in
your
favour

<EOS>
that
be
what
I
say
to
my
worthy
and
singular
good
client
,
Sir
Thomas
;
but
he
be
somewhat
headstrong
and
vehement
,
and
will
not
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
be
for
settle
matter
by
the
sword
,
for
make
forcible
entry
and
detainer
,
and
oust
the
tenant
in
possession
,
whereby
he
would
render
himself
liable
to
arrest
,
fine
,
ransom
,
and
forfeiture
;
instead
of
proceed
cautiously
and
decorously
as
the
law
direct
,
and
as
I
advise
,
Sir
Ralph
,
by
writ
of
_
ejectione
firmæ
_
or
action
of
trespass
,
the
which
would
assuredly
establish
his
title
,
and
restore
him
the
house
and
land
.
<EOS>
or
he
may
proceed
by
writ
of
right
,
which
perhaps
,
in
his
case
,
consider
the
long
absence
of
possession
,
and
the
doubt
suppose
to
perplex
the
title
--
though
I
myself
have
no
doubt
about
it
--
would
be
the
most
efficacious
.
<EOS>
these
be
your
only
true
weapon
,
Sir
Ralph
--
your
writ
of
entry

assise
,

your
plea
of

your
remitter
,
your
præcipe

your

the
sword

armour
of
proof
of
a

in
one
respect
I
be
of

opinion

would
rather

<EOS>
not
far
from
the
green
where
the
May
-
day
revel
be
hold
,
stand
the
ancient
parish
church
of
Whalley
,
its
square
tower
surmount
with
a
flag
-
staff
and
banner
,
and
shake
with
the
joyous
peal
of
the
ringer

<EOS>
a
picturesque
and
beautiful
structure
<EOS>
it
be
,
though
full
of
architectural
incongruity
;
and
its
grey
wall
and
hoary
buttress
,
with
the
lancet
-
shape
window
of
the
choir
,
and
the
ramify
tracery
of
the
fine
eastern
window
,
could
not
fail
to
please
any
taste
not
quite
so
critical
as
to
require
absolute
harmony
and
perfection
in
a
building
.
<EOS>
part
of
the
venerable
fabric
be
old
than
the
Abbey
itself
,
date
back
as
far
as
the
eleventh
century
,
when
a
chapel
occupy
the
site
;
and
though
many
alteration
have
be
make
in
the
subsequent
structure
at
various
time
,
and
many
beauty
destroy
,
especially
during
the
period
of
the
Reformation
,
enough
of
its
pristine
character
remain
to
render
it
a
very
good
speciman
of
an
old
country
church
.
<EOS>
internally
,
the
cylindrical
column
of
the
north
aisle
,
the
construction
of
the
choir
,
and
the
three
stone
seat
support
on
rounded
column
near
the
altar

proclaim
its
high
antiquity

<EOS>
within

choir

eighteen

similar
position
in

desecrated
conventual
church

though
exquisite
in
themselves

they
seem
here
sadly
out
of
place

not

proportionate
to
the
structure

<EOS>
Their
elaborately

seat

far
into

their

<EOS>

it

well
<EOS>
they

within

two
fine

an
old
stone
coffin
,
together
with
a
fragment
of
a
curious
monumental
effigy
,
likewise
of
stone

but
the
most
striking
object
in
the
place
,
and
deservedly
rank
amongst
the
wonder
of

be
three
remarkable
obelisk

shape
crosse

upon

cover
with
singular
device
in

all
three
differ
in
size

<EOS>
evidently
of

antiquity

other
legend

them
by
the
vulgar

dim
mystery

over
them

<EOS>
vestige
of
another
people
and
another
faith
be
likewise
here
discernible
,
for
where
the
Saxon
forefather
of
the
village
pray
and
slumber
in
death
,
the
roman
invader
of
the
isle
have
trodden
,
and
perchance
perform
their
religious
rite
;
some
trace
of
an
encampment

some
forty

the

on

it

land

see
how
this
superstitious
notion
have
be
disprove
in
our

to
whom
Whalley
Abbey

its

have
bring
wealth

<EOS>
"
there
be
something
in

Nicholas

though
our

I

continue
an

most

,
without

the
point

there
be
one

undoubtedly

long
after
his
death

<EOS>
You
have
hear
,
I
suppose
,
that
he
pronounce
a
dreadful
anathema
upon
the
child
of
a
man
who
have
the
reputation
of
be
a
wizard
,
and
who
afterwards
act
as
his
executioner
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
the
whole
particular
of
the
dark
story
,
but
I
know
that
Paslew
fix
a
curse
upon
the
child
,
declare
it
should
become
a
witch
,
and
the
mother
of
witch
.
<EOS>
and
the
prediction
have
be
verify
.
<EOS>
nigh
eighty
year
have
fly
by
since
then
,
and
the
infant
still
live
--
a
fearful
and
mischievous
witch
--
and
all
her
family
be
similarly
fate
--
all
be
witch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
the
story
before
,
"
say
Richard
,
somewhat
thoughtfully
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
guess
to
whom
you
allude
--
<EOS>
Mother
Demdike
of
Pendle
Forest
,
and
her
family
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
precisely
,
"
rejoin
Nicholas
;
"
they
be
a
brood
of
witch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
that
case
Alizon
Device
must
be
a
witch
,
"
cry
Richard
;
"
and
I
think
you
will
hardly
venture
upon
such
an
assertion
after
what
you
have
see
of
her
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
a
witch
,
I
would
there
be
many
such
--
as
fair
and
gentle
.
<EOS>
and
see
you
not
how
easily
the
matter
be
explain
?
'
<EOS>
give
a
dog
an
ill
name
and
hang
him'--a
proverb
with
which
you
be
familiar
enough
.
<EOS>
so
with
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
whether
really
uttered
or
not
,
the
abbot
's
curse
upon
her
and
her
issue
have
be
bruit
abroad
,
and
hence
she
be
make
a
witch
,
and
her
child
be
suppose
to
inherit
the
infamous
taint
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
with
yon
tomb
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
to
be
dangerous
to
our
family
,
and
dangerous
no
doubt
it
be
to
those
who
believe
in
the
saying
,
which
,
luckily
,
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
the
prophecy
work
its
own
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
the
absurdity
and
injustice
of
yield
to
the
opinion
be
manifest
.
<EOS>
no
wrong
can
have
be
do
the
abbot
by
Mother
Demdike
,
any
more
than
by
her
child
,
and
yet
they
be
to
be
punish
for
the
misdeed
of
their
predecessor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
just
as
you
and
I
,
who
be
of

third

fourth
generation

may
be
punish
for
the
sin

Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
scripture
against
you

Dick

<EOS>
the
only
thing
I
see
in
favour
of
your
argument
be
,
the
instance
you
allege
of
Alizon
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
look
like
a
witch

certainly
;
but
there
be
no
saying

She
may
be
only
the
more
dangerous
for
her
rare
beauty

and
apparent
innocence

<EOS>
"
I
would
answer
for
her
truth
with
my
life

"
cry
Richard
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
look
at
her
countenance
,
in
which
candour
and
purity
shine
forth
,
and
doubt
her
goodness

"
 
<EOS>
"
She
hath
cast
her
spell
over
you

Dick

that
be
certain

rejoin
Nicholas
,
laugh
;
"
but
to
be
serious
.
<EOS>
Alizon
,
I
admit
,
be
an
exception
to
the
rest
of
the
family
,
but
that
only
strengthen
the
general
rule
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
remark
the
strange
look
they
all
--
save
the
fair
maid
in
question
--
<EOS>
have
about
the
eye
?
"
 
<EOS>
Richard
answer
in
the
negative
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
singular
,
and
I
wonder
you
have
not
notice
it
,
"
pursue
Nicholas
;
"
but
the
question
of
reputed
witchcraft
in
Mother
Demdike
have
some
chance
of
be
speedily
settle
;
for
Master
Potts
,
the
little
London
lawyer
,
who
go
with
us
to
Pendle
Forest
to
-
morrow
,
be
about
to
have
her
arrest
and
examine
before
a
magistrate
.
"
 
"
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Richard
,
"
this
must
be
prevent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Nicholas
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
because
the
prejudice
exist
against
her
be
sure
to
convict
and
destroy
her
,
"
reply
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
great
age
,
infirmity
,
and
poverty
,
will
be
proofs
against
her
.
<EOS>
how
can
she
,
or
any
old
enfeebled
creature
like
her
,
whose
decrepitude
and
misery
should
move
compassion
rather
than
excite
fear
--
how
can
such
a
person
defend
herself
against
charge
easily
make
,
and
impossible
to
refute
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
deny
the
possibility
of
witchcraft
,
even
in
our
own
day
,
though
I
think
it
of
very
unlikely
occurrence
;
but
I
would
determinately
resist
give
credit
to
any
tale
tell
by
the
superstitious
vulgar
,
who
,
naturally
prone
to
cruelty
,
have
so
many
motive
for
revenge
imaginary
wrong
.
<EOS>
It
be
place
a
dreadful
weapon
in
their
hand
,
of
which
they
have
cunne
enough
to
know
the
use
,
but
neither
mercy
nor
justice
enough
to
restrain
them
from
use
it
.
<EOS>
better
let
one
guilty
person
escape
,
than
many
innocent
perish
.
<EOS>
so
many
undefined
charge
have
be
bring
against
Mother
Demdike
,
that
at
last
they
have
fix
a
stigma
on
her
name
,
and
make
her
an
object
of
dread
and
suspicion
.
<EOS>
She
be
endow
with
mysterious
power
,
which
would
have
no
effect
if
not
believe
in
;
and
now
must
be
burn
because
she
be
call
a
witch
,
and
be
dote
and
vain
enough
to
accept
the
title
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
in
a
witch
difficult
,
nay
,
almost
impossible
to
describe
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
"
but
you
can
not
be
mistake
about
her
.
<EOS>
by
her
general
ill
course
of
life
,
by
repeat
act
of
mischief
,
and
by
threat
,
follow
by
the
consequence
menace
,
she
become
known
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
mystery
in
the
matter
,
not
permit
human
knowledge
entirely
to
penetrate
;
but
,
as
we
know
from
the
scripture
that
the
sin
of
witchcraft
do
exist
,
and
as
we
have
no
evidence
that
it
have
cease
,
so
it
be
fair
to
conclude
,
that
there
may
be
practiser
of
the
dark
offence
in
our
own
day
,
and
such
I
hold
to
be
Mother
Demdike
and
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
rival
potentate
in
evil
<EOS>
,
they
contend
which
shall
do
most
mischief
,
but
it
must
be
admit
the
former
bear
away
the
bell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
all
the
ill
attribute
to
her
be
really
cause
by
her
machination
,
this
may
be
correct
,
"
reply
Richard
,
"
but
it
only
show
her
to
be
more
calumniate
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
cousin
Nicholas
,
I
look
upon
them
as
two
poor
old
creature
,
who
,
persuade
they
really
possess
the
supernatural
power
accord
to
them
by
the
vulgar
,
strive
to
act
up
to
their
part
,
and
be
mainly
assist
in
do
so
by
the
credulity
and
fear
of
their
audience
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
admit
the
blind
credulity
of
the
multitude
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
"
and
their
proneness
to
discern
the
hand
of
the
witch
in
the
most
trifling
accident
;
admit
also
,
their
readiness
to
accuse
any
old
crone
unlucky
enough
to
offend
them
of
sorcery
<EOS>
;
I
still
believe
that
there
be
actual
practiser
of
the
black
art
,
who
,
for
a
brief
term
of
power
,
have
enter
into
a
league
with
Satan
,
worship
him
and
attend
his
sabbath
,
and
have
a
familiar
,
in
the
shape
of
a
cat
,
dog
,
toad
,
or
mole
,
to
obey
their
behest
,
transform
themselves
into
various
shape
--
as
a
hound
,
horse
,
or
hare,--raise
storm
of
wind
or
hail
,
maim
cattle
,
bewitch
and
slay
human
being
,
and
ride
whither
they
will
on
broomstick
.
<EOS>
but
,
hold
the
contrary
opinion
,
you
will
not
,
I
apprehend
,
aid
Master
Potts
in
his
quest
of
witch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
"
rejoin
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
,
I
will
oppose
him
.
<EOS>
but
enough
of
this
.
<EOS>
let
us
go
forth
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
they
quit
the
church
together
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
issue
into
the
churchyard
,
they
find
the
principal
arbour

by
the

dancer

Robin
Hood

Doctor
Ormerod

towards

to

it

new

ruthless
experiment

almost
at

fling
one
coil
of
rope
across
the
river

it
be

much
dexterity
by

the
assemblage
then
spread
out
on
the
bank

while
Jem
,
take
the
poor
young
woman
in
his
arm
,
who
neither
speak
nor
struggle
,
but
hold
her
breath
tightly
,
approach
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dunna

rejoin
Jem

gruffly

<EOS>
and
without
bestow
further
attention
upon
her
,
he
let
down
his
burden
carefully
into
the
water
;
and
this
achieve
,
he
call
out
to

who
draw
her
slowly
towards
him

while
Jem
guide
her
with
the
other
rope

<EOS>
the
crowd
watch
the
experiment
for
a
few
moment
in
profound
silence

but
as
the
poor
young

who
have
now
reach
the
centre

the
stream

still
float

be
support
either
by
the
tension

by
her
woollen
apparel

a
loud
shout
be
raise
that
she
could
not
sink

and
be

therefore

an

the

water
ordeal

<EOS>
Our
sovereign

master

in
his
wisdom

hath
graciously
vouchsafe
to
explain
the
matter
thus

them
(
meaning

of
course
)
in

bosom

that
have
shake
off
their
sacred
water
of
baptism
,
and
wilfully
refuse
the
benefit
thereof
.
'
<EOS>
It
be
manifest
,
you
see

that
this
diabolical
young
woman
hath
renounce
her
baptism

for
the
water
rejecteth
her

Non

She
float
like

as
if
the
clear
water
of
the
Calder
have
suddenly
become
like
the
slab
,
salt
wave
of
the
Dead
Sea
,
in
which
,
nothing
can
sink

You

<EOS>
"
Hoo

Jem
Device

<EOS>
but
as
he

,
chance
slightly
to
slacken
the
rope

the
tension
of
which
maintain
the
equilibrium
of
the
body

the
poor
woman

<EOS>
a
groan
,
as
much
of
disappointment
as
sympathy
,
break
from
the
spectator
,
but
none
attempt
to
aid
her
;
and
on
see
her
sink
,
Jem
abandon
the
rope
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
but
assistance
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
two
person
rush
quickly
and
furiously
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
They
be
Richard
and
Nicholas
Assheton
.
<EOS>
the
iron
bar
have
at
length
yield
to
their
effort
,
and
the
first
use
they
make
of
their
freedom
be
to
hurry
to
the
river
.
<EOS>
a
glance
show
them
what
have
occur
,
and
the
young
Assheton
,
unhesitatingly
plunge
into
the
water
,
seize
the
rope
drop
by
Jem
,
and
call
to
the
beadle
to
let
go
his
hold
,
drag
forth
the
poor
half
-
drown
young
woman
,
and
place
her
on
the
bank
,
hew
asunder
the
cord
that
bind
her
hand
and
foot
with
his
sword
.
<EOS>
but
though
still
sensible
,
Nance
be
so
much
exhaust
by
the
shock
she
have
undergo
,
and
her
muscle
be
so
severely

by
the
painful
and
unnatural
posture
to
which
she
have
be
compel

that
she
be
wholly
unable

<EOS>
Her
thumb
be
blacken
and
swollen
,
and
the
cord
have
cut
into
the
flesh
,
while
blood
trickle
down
from
the
puncture
in
her
breast

<EOS>
fix
a
look
of
inexpressible
gratitude
upon
her
preserver

she
make
an
effort
to
speak
,
but
the
exertion
be
too
great
;
violent
hysterical
sobbing
come
on
,
and
her
sense
soon
after
forsook
her
.
<EOS>
Richard
call
loudly
for
assistance
,
and
the
sentiment
of
the
most
humane
part
of
the
crowd
have
undergo
a
change
since
the
failure
of
the
ordeal
,
some
female
come
forward
,
and
take
step
for
her
restoration
.
<EOS>
sensibility
have
return

a
cloak

around
her

stiffened
limb

chafed
and

and
it
begin
to
be

consequence
would
ensue

aside
the

such

it

innocent

her

CHAPTER
VII.--THE
ruined
conventual
CHURCH
.
  
<EOS>
beneath
a
wild
cherry
-
tree
,
plant
by
chance
in
the
Abbey
garden
,
and
of
such
remarkable
size
that
it
almost
rival
the
elm
and
lime
tree
surround
it
,
and
when
in
bloom
resemble
an
enormous
garland
,
stand
two
young
maiden
,
both
of
rare
beauty
,
though
in
totally
different
styles;--the
one
be
fair
-
haired
and
blue
-
eyed
,
with
a
snowy
skin
tinge
with
delicate
bloom
,
like
that
of
rose
see
through
milk
,
to
borrow
a
simile
from
old
Anacreon
;
while
the
other
far
eclipse
her
in
the
brilliancy
of
her
complexion
,
the
dark
splendour
of
her
eye
,
and
the
luxuriance
of
her
jetty
tress
,
which
,
unbound
and
knot
with
riband
,
flow
down
almost
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
in
age
,
there
be
little
disparity
between
them
,
though
perhaps
the
dark
-
haired
girl
may
be
a
year
nearer
twenty
than
the
other
,
and
somewhat
more
of
seriousness
,
though
not
much
,
sit
upon
her
lovely
countenance
than
on
the
other
's
laughing
feature
.
<EOS>
different
be
they
too
,
in
degree
,
and
here
social
position
be
infinitely
in
favour
of
the
fairer
girl
,
but
no
one
would
have
judge
it
so
if
not
previously
acquaint
with
their
history
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
rather
the
one
have
least
title
to
be
proud
(
<EOS>
if
any
one
have
such
title
)
who
now
seem
to
look
up
to
her
companion
with
mingle
admiration
and
regard
;
the
latter
being
enthral
at
the
moment
by
the
rich
note
of
a
thrush
pour
from
a
neighbour
lime
-
tree
.
 
<EOS>
Pleasant
be
the
garden
where
the
two
girl
stand
,
shade
by
great
tree
,
lay
out
in
exquisite
parterre
,
with
knot
and
figure
,
quaint
flower
-
bed
,
shorn
tree
and
hedge
,
cover
alley
and
arbour
,
terrace
and
mound
,
in
the
taste
of
the
time
,
and
above
all
an
admirably
keep
bowling
-
green
.
<EOS>
It
be
bound
on
the
one
hand
by
the
ruin
chapter
-
house
and
vestry
of
the
old
monastic
structure
,
and
on
the
other
by
the
stately
pile
of
building
formerly
make
part
of
the
Abbot
's
lodging
,
in
which
the
long
gallery
be
situate
,
some
of
its
window
look
upon
the
bowling
-
green
,
and
then
keep
in
excellent
condition
,
but
now
roofless
and
desolate
.
<EOS>
behind
them
,
on
the
right
,
half
hide
by
tree
,
lie
the
desecrated
and
despoil
conventual
church
.
<EOS>
rear
at
such
cost
,
and
with
so
much
magnificence
,
by
thirteen
abbot
--
the
great
work
have
be
commence
,
as
heretofore
state
,
by
Robert
de
Topcliffe
,
in
1330
,
and
only
complete
in
all
its
detail
by
John

this

accord
to
Whitaker
,
"
many

"
be
now
abandon
to
the
slow
ravage
of
decay
.
<EOS>
Would
it
have
never
encounter
bad
enemy
!
<EOS>
but
some
half
century
later
,
the
hand
of
man
be
call
in
to
accelerate
its
destruction
,
and
it
be
then
almost
entirely
rase
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
at
the
period
in
question
though
partially
unroofed
,
and
with
some
of
the
wall
destroy
,
it
be
still
beautiful
and
picturesque
--
<EOS>
more
picturesque
,
indeed
than
in
the
day
of
its
pride
and
splendour
.
<EOS>
the
tower
with
its
lofty
crockete
spire
be
still
stand
,
though
the
latter
be
crack
and
totter
,
and
the
jackdaw
roost
within
its
window
and
belfry
.
<EOS>
two
range
of
break
column
tell
of
the
bygone
glory
of
the
aisle
;
and
the
beautiful
side
chapel
have
escape
injury
better
than
other
part
of
the
fabric
,
remain
in
tolerable
preservation
.
<EOS>
but
the
choir
and
high
altar
be
strip
of
all
their
rich
carving
and
ornament
,
and
the
rain
descend
through
the
open
rood
-
loft
upon
the
now
grass
-
grow
grave
of
the
abbot
in
the
presbytery
.
<EOS>
here
and
there
the
ramify
mullion
still
retain
their
wealth
of
paint
glass
,
and
the
grand
eastern
window
shone
gorgeously
as
of
yore
.
<EOS>
all
else
be
neglect
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
brier
and
turf
usurp
the
place
of
the
marble
pavement
;
many
of
the
pillar
be
festoon
with
ivy
;
and
,
in
some
place
,
the
shatter
wall
be
cover
with
creeper
,
and
tree
have
take
root
in
the
crevice
of
the
masonry
.
<EOS>
beautiful
at
all
time
be
these
magnificent
ruin
;
but
never
so
beautiful
as
when
see
by
the
witching
light
of
the
moon
--
the
hour
,
accord
to
the
good
authority
,
when
all
ruin
should
be
view
--
when
the
long
line
of
broken
pillar
,
the
mouldering
arch
,
and
the
still
glow
pane
over
the
altar
,
have
a
magical
effect
.
 
<EOS>
in
front
of
the
maidens
stand
a
square
tower
,
part
of
the
defence
of
the
religious
establishment
,
erect
by
Abbot
Lyndelay
,
in
the
reign
of
Edward
III
.
,
but
disuse
and
decay
.
<EOS>
It
be
sustain
by
high
and
richly
groin
arch
,
cross
the
swift
mill

race
,
and
face
the
river

<EOS>
a
path
lead
through
the
ruin
chapter
-
house
to
the
spacious
cloister
quadrangle
,
once
use
as
a
cemetery
for
the
monk
,
but
now
convert
into
a
kitchen
garden
,
its
broad
area
be
plant
out
,
and
fruit
-
tree
train
against
the
hoary
wall
.
<EOS>
little
of
the
old
refectory
be
leave
,
except
the
dilapidated
stair
once
conduct
to
the
gallery
where
the
brother
be
will
not
to
take
their
meal
,
but
the
inner
wall
still
serve
to
enclose
the
garden
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
of
the
dormitory
,
formerly
constitute
the
eastern
angle
of
the
cloister
,
the
shell
be
still
leave
,
and
it
be
use
partly
as
a
grange
,
partly
as
a
shed
for
cattle
,
the
farm
-
yard
and
tenement
lie
on
this
side
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
will
be
see
that
the
garden
and
ground
,
fill
up
the
ruin
of
Whalley
Abbey
,
offer
abundant
point
of
picturesque
attraction
,
all
of
which
--
with
the
exception
of
the
ruin
conventual
church
--
have
be
visit
by
the
two
girl

<EOS>
They
have
track
the
labyrinth
of
passage
,
scale
the
broken
staircase
,
creep
into
the
roofless
and
neglect
chamber
,
peer
timorously
into
the
black
and
yawn
vault
,
and
now
,
have
finish
their
investigation
,
have
pause
for
awhile
,
previous
to
extend
their
ramble
to
the
church
,
beneath
the
wild
cherry

tree
to
listen
to
the
warbling
of
the
bird

I

the

no

I

therefore

indulge

yet
I
have
no

she
have
show
me
little

repel
all
exhibition
of
affection
on
my
part

she
have
treat
me
very
differently

her
other
child

with
much
great
consideration

<EOS>
I
can
make
slight
boast
of
education

the
good
the
village
could
afford
have

vicarage
propose
,
as
you
have
do
,
that
I
should
live
with
them
,
but
my
mother
forbid
it
;
enjoin
me
,
on
the
peril
of
incur
her
displeasure
,
not
to
leave
her
,
and
remind
me
of
all
the
benefit
I
have
receive
from
her
,
and
of
the
necessity
of
make
an
adequate
return
.
<EOS>
and
,
ungrateful
indeed
I
should
be
,
if
I
do
not
comply
;
for
,
though
her
manner
be
harsh
and
cold
to
me
<EOS>
,
she
have
never
ill
-
use
me
,
as
she
have
do
her
favourite
child
,
my
little
sister
Jennet
,
but
have
always
allow
me
a
separate
chamber
,
where
I
can
retire
when
I
please
,
to
read
,
or
meditate
,
or
pray
.
<EOS>
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
dear
young
lady
,
I
dare
not
pray
before
my
mother
.
<EOS>
be
not
shocked
at
what
I
tell
you
,
but
I
can
not
hide
it
.
<EOS>
My
poor
mother
deny
herself
the
consolation
of
religion
--
never
address
herself
to
Heaven
in
prayer
--
never
open
the
book
of
Life
and
Truth
--
never
enter
church
.
<EOS>
in
her
own
mistaken
way
she
have
bring
up
poor
little
Jennet
,
who
have
be
teach
to
make
a
scoff
at
religious
truth
and
ordinance
,
and
have
never
be
suffer
to
keep
holy
the
Sabbath
-
day
.
<EOS>
happy
and
thankful
be
I
,
that
no
such
evil
lesson
have
be
teach
me
,
but
rather
,
that
I
have
profit
by
the
sad
example
.
<EOS>
in
my
own
secret
chamber
I
have
pray
,
daily
and
nightly
,
for
both
--
pray
that
their
heart
may
be
turn
.
<EOS>
often
have
I
besought
my
mother
to
let
me
take
Jennet
to
church
,
but
she
never
would
consent
.
<EOS>
and
in
that
poor
misguided
child
,
dear
young
lady
,
there
be
a
strange
mixture
of
good
and
ill
.
<EOS>
afflict
with
personal
deformity
,
and
delicate
in
health
,
the
mind
perhaps
sympathise
with
the
body
,
she
be
wayward
and
uncertain
in
temper
,
but
sensitive
and
keenly
alive
to
kindness
,
and
with
a
shrewdness
beyond
her
year
.
<EOS>
at
the
risk
of
offend
my
mother
,
for
I
feel
confident
I
be
act
rightly
,
I
have
endeavour
to
instil
religious
principle
into
her
heart
,
and
to
inspire
her
with
a
love
of
truth
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
have
listen
to
me
;
and
I
have
observe
strange
struggle
in
her
nature
,
as
if
the
good
be
obtain
mastery
of
the
evil
principle
,
and
I
have
strive
the
more
to
convince
her
,
and
win
her
over
,
but
never
with
entire
success
,
for
my
effort
have
be
overcome
by
pernicious
counsel
,
and
sceptical
sneer
.
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
young
lady
,
what
would
I
not
do
to
be
the
instrument
of
her
salvation
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
pain
me
much
by
this
relation

Alizon

say
Dorothy
Assheton
,
who
have
listen
with
profound
attention
,
"
and
I
now
wish
more
ardently
than
ever
to
take
you
from
such
a
family

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
leave
them
,
dear
young
lady
,
"
reply
Alizon
;
"
for
I
feel
I
may
be
of
infinite
service

especially
to
Jennet

by
stay
with
them

<EOS>
where
there
be
a
soul
to

the
soul

no
sacrifice
can

great

<EOS>
no
price

heavy

<EOS>
by
the
blessing
of
Heaven
I

to

<EOS>
"
I
will
not
oppose
your
virtuous
intention

dear
Alizon

"
reply
Dorothy
;
"
but
I
must
now
mention
a
circumstance
in
connexion
with
your
mother

of
which
you
be
perhaps
in
ignorance

but
which
it
be
right
you
should
know

therefore
no
false
delicacy

restrain

from

<EOS>
Your
grandmother

Old
Demdike

be
stigmatise

even
by

Your

opprobrium
attach
to
her

I
dread
this

Alizon

deadly
pale

tremble
violently

<EOS>
I
fear
you
have
hear
the
terrible
report

believe
it

My
poor

be
err
enough

bad

<EOS>
"
I
will
not

Dorothy
,

since
she
be
bless
with
such
a

what
I
fear
be
that
you

you
so
kind

so
good

so
beautiful

may
come
under
the

I

run
this

Dorothy

earnestly

<EOS>
while
thus
converse
,
they
gradually
stray
away
from
the
cherry

tree

and
take
a
wind
path
lead
in
that
direction
,
enter
the
conventual
church

about
the
middle
of
the
south
aisle

after
gaze
with
wonder

delight
at
the
still
majestic
pillar

that
,
like
ghost
of
the
depart

seem
to
protest
against
the
desolation
around
them

they
take
their
way
along
the
nave
,
through
broken
arch
,
and
over
prostrate
fragment
of
stone
,
to
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
fane

and
have
admire
the
light
shaft
and
clerestory
window
of
the
choir

as
well
as
the
magnificent
paint
glass
over
the
altar

before
an
arched
doorway
on

with
two

of
which

closed

it
easily
open
when
try
by
Dorothy
,

they
find
themselves
in
a
small

beautiful
chapel
.
<EOS>
what
strike
them
chiefly
in
it
be
a
magnificent
monument
of
white
marble

numerous

two
recumbent

armour

cover
with
a
surcoat

<EOS>
this
superb
monument

behind

discover
a
flight
of
steep
stone
step
,
lead
to
a
vault

other
subterranean
chamber

<EOS>
after
look
round
this
chapel

Dorothy

,
"
there
be
something
else
that

just
occur
to

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
the

I
can
not

an

"
 
<EOS>
"
far
be
it
from
me
to
affirm
the
contrary

reply
Dorothy
;
"
but
it
be
undoubted
that
some
family

be

be
,
under
the
influence

an
inevitable
fatality

<EOS>
in
one
respect

also

it

some
baneful
influence

<EOS>
Her
unholy
life
,
her
strange
action
,
all
impress
me
with
the
idea

<EOS>
and
there
be
the

tendency
in
Jennet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
a

inquire
Dorothy

return
Alizon

slightly
colour

I
see
little

he
live
near
my
grandmother

in
Pendle
Forest

always
avoid
me
in
his
rare
visit
here

<EOS>
You
will
think
it
strange

I
tell
you
I

I

there
frequently

at
one
time
I
much

press
my

still

I
must
confess

itself
up

pass
through

he
abstain

inquiry

"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
do
not
venture
to
give
utterance
to
the
same
sentiment
,
but
her
look
plainly
express
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only

"
say
Richard
to
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
can
not

"
she

turn
to
Dorothy

"
he

just
like

<EOS>
"
You
have
make
a
bitter
enemy
of
him
,
Nicholas

observe
Mistress

so
look
well
to
yourself

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I

him
not

"
rejoin
the
squire

he

I
shall
take
good
care
how
I
put
myself
in
his
power

<EOS>
one
thing
I
may
mention
,
to
show
the
impotent
malice
of
the
knave

<EOS>
just
as
he
be
set
off
,
he
say
,
'
this
be
not
the
only
discovery
of
witchcraft
I

make
to

<EOS>
I

another

<EOS>
what

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not

Mistress
Nutter

a
shade
of
disquietude
pass
over
her
countenance

<EOS>

he

quite
capable
of
bring
the
charge
against
you

any
of
us

"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
so
,
"
say
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
what
have
occur
,
I
wonder
whether
he
will
go
over
to
Rough
Lee
to

morrow
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
likely
not
,
"
reply
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
in
that
case
Master
Roger
Nowell
must
provide
some
other
person
competent
to
examine
the
boundary
-
line
of
the
property
on
his
behalf

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

then
you

confident

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
quite
so
,
"
reply
Mistress
Nutter
,
with
a
self
-
satisfied
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
result
,
I
hope
,
may
justify
your
expectation
,
"
say
Nicholas
;
"
but
it
be
right
to
tell
you
,
that
Sir
Ralph
,
in
consent
to
postpone
his
decision
,
have
only
do
so
out
of
consideration
to
you

<EOS>
if
the
division

Master

unquestionably
obtain
an
award
in

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
under
such
circumstance
he
may
,

you

soon

<EOS>
a

of
hot
sack
put
my

into

luckily

a
change

We

Our

in

court
of
law

<EOS>
You
understand

Master

<EOS>

there
be

a
fool

drily

<EOS>
Would
it

You

assuredly
not

since
you

my

must
not

I
have
a
clear

CHAPTER
viii.--the
REVELATION
.
  
<EOS>
on
quit
the
long
gallery
,
Mistress
Nutter
and
Alizon
ascend
a
wide
staircase
,
and
,
traverse
a
corridor
,
come
to
an
antique
,
tapestried
chamber
,
richly
but
cumbrously
furnished
,
have
a
carve
oak
bedstead
with
sombre
hanging
,
a
few
high
-
back
chair
of
the
same
material
,
and
a
massive
wardrobe
,
with
shrine
-
work
atop
,
and
two
finely
sculpture
figure
,
of
the
size
of
life
,
in
the
habit
of
cistertian
monk
,
place
as
supporter
at
either
extremity
.
<EOS>
at
one
side
of
the
bed
the
tapestry
be
draw
aside
,
show
the
entrance
to
a
closet
or
inner
room
,
and
opposite
it
there
be
a
great
yawning
fireplace
,
with
a
lofty
mantelpiece
and
chimney
project
beyond
the
wall
.
<EOS>
the
window
be
narrow
,
and
darken
by
heavy
transom
bar
and
small
diamond
pane
while
the
view
without
,
look
upon
Whalley
Nab
,
be
obstruct
by
the
contiguity
of
a
tall
cypress
,
whose
funereal
branch
add
to
the
general
gloom
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
one
of
those
formerly
allot
to
their
guest
by
the
hospitable
abbot
,
and
have
undergo
little
change
since
their
time
,
except
in
regard
to
furniture
;
and
even
that
appear
old
and
fade
now
.
<EOS>
what
with
the
gloomy
arra
,
the
shrouded
bedstead
,
and
the
gothic
wardrobe
with
its
mysterious
figure
,
the
chamber
have
a
grim
,
ghostly
air
,
and
so
the
young
girl
think
on
enter
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
bring
you
hither
,
Alizon
,
"
say
Mistress
Nutter
,
motion
her
to
a
seat
,
"
that
we
may
converse
without
chance
of
interruption
,
for
I
have
much
to
say
.
<EOS>
on
first
see
you
to
-
day
,
your
appearance
,
so
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
May
-
day
mummer
,
strike
me
forcibly
,
and
I
resolve
to
question
Elizabeth
Device
about
you
.
<EOS>
accordingly
I
bade
her
join
me
in
the
Abbey
garden
.
<EOS>
She
do
so
,
and
have
not
long
leave
me
when
I
accidentally
meet
you
and
the
other
in
the
Lacy
Chapel
.
<EOS>
when
question
,
Elizabeth
affect
great
surprise
,
and
deny
positively
that
there
be
any
foundation
for
the
idea
that
you
be
other
than
her
child
;
but
,
notwithstanding
her
asseveration
,
I
could
see
from
her
confused
manner
that
there
be
more
in
the
notion
than
she
choose
to
admit
,
and
I
determine
to
have
recourse
to
other
mean
of
arrive
at
the
truth
,
little
expect
my
suspicion
would
be
so
soon
confirm
by
Mother
Chattox
.
<EOS>
to
my
interrogation
of
that
old
woman
,
you
be
yourself
a
party
,
and
I
be
now
rejoice
that
you
interfere
to
prevent
me
from
prosecute
my
inquiry
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
present
from
whom
the
secret
of
your
birth
must
be
strictly
keep
--
at
least
,
for
awhile
--
and
my
impatience
carry
me
too
far
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
obey
a
natural
impulse
,
madam
,
"
say
Alizon
;
"
but
I
be
at
a
loss
to
conceive
what
claim
I
can
possibly
have
to
the
consideration
you
show
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
listen
to
me
,
and
you
shall
learn
,
"
reply
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
sad
tale
,
and
its
recital
will
tear
open
old
wound
,
but
it
must
not
be
withhold
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
you
to
bury
the
secret
I
be
about
to
impart
in
the
recess
of
your
bosom
.
<EOS>
You
will
do
so
when
you
learn
them
,
without
my
tell
you
.
<EOS>
when
little
more
than
your
age
I
be
wed
;
but
not
to
him
I
would
have
choose
if
choice
have
be
permit
me
.
<EOS>
the
union
I
need
scarcely
say
be
unhappy
--
most
unhappy
--
though
my
discomfort
be
scrupulously
conceal
,
and
I
be
look
upon
as
a
devoted
wife
,
and
my
husband
as
a
model
of
conjugal
affection
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
merely
the
surface
--
internally
all
be
strife
and
misery
.
<EOS>
erelong
my
dislike
of
my
husband
increase
to
absolute
hate
,
while
on
his
part
,
though
he
still
regard
me
with
as
much
passion
as
heretofore
,
he
become
frantically
jealous
--
and
above
all
of
Edward
Braddyll
of
Portfield
,
who
,
as
his
bosom
friend
,
and
my
distant
relative
,
be
a
frequent
visiter
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
to
relate
the
numerous
exhibition
of
jealousy
that
occur
would
answer
little
purpose
,
and
it
will
be
enough
to
say
that
not
a
word
or
look
pass
between
Edward
and
myself
but
be
misconstrue
.
<EOS>
I
take
care
never
to
be
alone
with
our
guest
--
nor
to
give
any
just
ground
for
suspicion
--
but
my
caution
avail
nothing
.
<EOS>
an
easy
remedy
would
have
be
to
forbid
Edward
the
house
,
but
this
my
husband
's
pride
reject
.
<EOS>
He
prefer
to
endure
the
jealous
torment
occasion
by
the
presence
of
his
wife
's
fancy
lover
,
and
inflict
needless
anguish
on
her
,
rather
than
brook
the
jeer
of
a
few
indifferent
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
the
same
feeling
make
him
desire
to
keep
up
an
apparent
good
understanding
with
me
;
and
so
far
I
second
his
view
,
for
I
share
in
his
pride
,
if
in
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
Our
quarrel
be
all
in
private
,
when
no
eye
could
see
us
--
no
ear
listen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yours
be
a
melancholy
history
,
madam
,
"
remark
Alizon
,
in
a
tone
of
profound
interest
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
think
so
ere
<EOS>
I
have
do

"
return
the
lady
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
the
only
person
in
my
confidence
,
and
aware
of
my
secret
sorrow
,
be
Elizabeth
Device
,
who
with
her
husband
,
John
Device
,
then
live
at
Rough
Lee
.
<EOS>
serve
me
in
the
quality
of
tire

woman

personal
attendant

what
take
place

poor
soul
offer
me
all
the
sympathy
in
her
power

<EOS>
much
be
it
need

for
I
have
no
other
sympathy

<EOS>
after
awhile
,
I
know
not
from
what
cause
,
unless
from
some
imprudence
on
the
part
of
Edward
Braddyll
,
who
be
wild
and
reckless
,
my
husband
conceive
bad
suspicion
than
ever
of
me

and
begin
to
treat
me
with
such
harshness
and
cruelty

that
,
unable
longer
to
endure
his
violence

I
appeal
to
my
father

<EOS>
but
he
be
of
a
stern
and
arbitrary
nature

and
,
have
force
me
into
the
match

would
not
listen
to
my
complaint

but
bade
me
submit
.

<EOS>
It
be
my
duty
to
do
so

he
say
,
and
he
add
some
cut
expression
to
the
effect
that
I
deserve
the
treatment
I

to
desperation

unspotte

eye

tarnish
it

thus
for

innocent
endearment

compensation

the
harshness

bright

for
weakness
prevent
me
from
afford
it
the
support
it
be
a
mother
's
bless
privilege
to
bestow
.
<EOS>
She
seem
as
fond
of
it
as
myself
;
and
never
be
babe
more
calculated
to
win
love
than
my
little
Millicent
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
shall
I
go
on
?
<EOS>
the
retrospect
I
be
compel
to
take
be
frightful
,
but
I
can
not
shun
it
.
<EOS>
the
foul
and
false
suspicion
entertain
by
my
husband
begin
to
settle
on
the
child
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
believe
it
to
be
his
own
.
<EOS>
with
violent
oath
and
threat
he
first
announce
his
odious
suspicion
to
Elizabeth
Device
,
and
she
,
full
of
terror
,
communicate
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
tiding
fill
me
with
inexpressible
alarm
;
for
I
know
,
if
the
dread
idea
have
once
take
possession
of
him
,
it
would
never
be
remove
,
while
what
he
threaten
would
be
execute
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
flee
at
once
with
my
poor
babe
if
I
have
know
where
to
go
;
but
I
have
no
place
of
shelter
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
in
vain
to
seek
refuge
with
my
father
;
and
I
have
no
other
relative
or
friend
whom
I
could
trust
.
<EOS>
where
then
should
I
fly
?
<EOS>
at
last
I
bethink
me
of
a
retreat
,
and
arrange
a
plan
of
escape
with
Elizabeth
Device
.
<EOS>
Vain
be
my
precaution
.
<EOS>
on
that
very
night
,
I
be
startle
from
slumber
by
a
sudden
cry
from
the
nurse
,
who
be
seat
by
the
fire
,
with
the
child
on
her
knee
.
<EOS>
It
be
long
past
midnight
,
and
all
the
household
be
at
rest
.
<EOS>
two
person
have
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
one
be
my
ruthless
husband
,
Richard
Nutter
;
the
other
be
John
Device
,
a
powerful
ruffianly
fellow
,
who
plant
himself
near
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
march
quickly
towards
Elizabeth
,
who
have
arise
on
see
him
,
my
husband
snatch
the
child
from
her
before
I
could
seize
it
,
and
with
a
violent
blow
on
the
chest
fell
me
to
the
ground
,
where
I
lay
helpless
,
speechless
.
<EOS>
with
reel
sense
I
hear
Elizabeth
cry
out
that
it
be
her
own
child
,
and
call
upon
her
husband
to
save
it
.
<EOS>
Richard
Nutter
pause
,
but
re
-
assure
by
a
laugh
of
disbelief
from
his
ruffianly
follower
,
he
tell
Elizabeth
the
pitiful
excuse
would
not
avail
to
save
the
brat
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
see
a
weapon
gleam
--
there
be
a
feeble
piteous
cry
--
a
cry
that
may
have
move
a
demon
--
but
it
do
not
move
_
<EOS>
him
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
with
wicked
word
and
blood
-
imbrue
hand
he
cast
the
body
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
the
horrid
sight
be
too
much
for
me
,
and
I
become
senseless
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
dreadful
tale
,
indeed
,
madam

<EOS>
cry
Alizon
,

with
horror
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
crime
be
hide
--
hide
from
the
eye
of
man
,
but
mark
the
retribution
that
follow

say
Mistress
Nutter
;
her
eye
sparkle
with
vindictive
joy

of
the
two

miserably

John

Richard
Nutter

end
be
terrible

the
pang

by
frightful
suffering

<EOS>
but
another
dark
event
precede
his
death
,
which
may
have
lay
a
crime
the
more
on
his
already
heavily

burden
soul

<EOS>
Edward
Braddyll
,
the
object
of
his
jealousy
and
hate
,
suddenly
sicken
of
a
malady
so
strange
and
fearful
,
that
all
who
see
him
affirm
it
the
result
of
witchcraft
.
<EOS>
none
think
of
my
husband
's
agency
in
the
dark
affair
except
myself
;
but
know
he
have
hold
many
secret
conference
about
the
time
with
Mother
Chattox
,
I
more
than
suspect
him
.
<EOS>
the
sick
man
die

and
from
that
hour
Richard
Nutter
know
no
rest

<EOS>
ever
on
horseback
,
or
fiercely
carouse
,
he
seek
in
vain
to
stifle
remorse
.
<EOS>
vision
scare
him
by
night
,
and
vague
fear
pursue
him
by
day

<EOS>
He
would
start
at
shadow
,
and
talk
wildly
.
<EOS>
to
me
his
whole
demeanour
be
alter
;
and
he
strive
by
every
mean
in
his
power
to
win
my
love
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
give
me
back
the
treasure
he
have
take
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
to
life
my
murdered
babe
.
<EOS>
like
his
victim
,
he
fall
ill
on
a
sudden
,
and
of
a
strange
and
terrible
sickness
.
<EOS>
I
see
he
could
not
recover
,
and
therefore
tend
him
carefully
.
<EOS>
He
die
;
and
I
shed
no
tear

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
alas

exclaim
Alizon
,
"

guilty

I
can
not

compassionate
him

<EOS>
"
You
be

do
so

Alizon

Mistress
Nutter

Mistress

she
cry

<EOS>
"
the
voice
of
nature
from
the
first
plead
eloquently
in
your
behalf
,

I
should
have
be
deaf
to
all
impulse
of
affection
if
I
have
not
listen
to
the
call
.
<EOS>
I
now
trace
in
every
feature
the
lineament
of
the
babe
I
think
lose
for
ever
.
<EOS>
all
be
clear
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
exclamation
of
Elizabeth
Device
,
which
,
like
my
ruthless
husband
,
I
look
upon
as
an
artifice
to
save
the
infant
's
life
,
I
now
find
to
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Her
child
perish
instead
of
mine

<EOS>
how
or
why
she
exchange
the
infant
on
that
night

to
be
explain

that
she
do
so
be
certain
;
while
that
she
should
afterwards
conceal
the
circumstance
be
easily
comprehend
,
from
a
natural
dread
of
her
own
husband
as
well
as
of
mine
.
<EOS>
It
be
possible
that
from
some
cause
she
may
still
deny
the
truth
,
but
I
can
make
it
her
interest
to
speak
plainly
.
<EOS>
the
main
difficulty
will
lie
in
my
public
acknowledgment
of
you

,
at
whatever
cost
,
it
shall
be
make

It

bring
the
dark

<EOS>
but
other
terror
be
add
to
Alizon
's
natural
dread
of
the
elemental
warfare
.
<EOS>
again
she
fancy
the
two
monkish
figure
,
which
have
before
excite
her
alarm
,
move
,
and
even
shake
their
arm
menacingly
at
her
.
<EOS>
at
first
she
attribute
this
wild
idea
to
her
overwrought
imagination
,
and
strove
to
convince
herself
of
its
fallacy
by
keep
her
eye
steadily
fix
upon
them
.
<EOS>
but
each
succeed
flash
only
serve
to
confirm
her
superstitious
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
another
circumstance
contribute
to
heighten
her
alarm
.
<EOS>
scare
most
probably
by
the
storm
,
a
large
white
owl
flutter
down
the
chimney
,
and
after
wheel
twice
or
thrice
round
the
chamber
,
settle
upon
the
bed
,
hooting
,
puff
,
ruffle
its
feather
,
and
glare
at
her
with
eye
that
glow
like
fiery
coal
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
seem
little
move
by
the
storm
,
though
she
keep
a
profound
silence
,
but
when
Alizon
gaze
in
her
face
,
she
be
frighten
by
its
expression
,
which
remind
her
of
the
terrible
aspect
she
have
wear
at
the
interview
with
Mother
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
all
at
once
Mistress
Nutter
arise
,
and
,
rapid
as
the
lightning
play
around
her
and
reveal
her
movement
,
make
several
pass
,
with
extended
hand
,
over
her
daughter
;
and
on
this
the
latter
instantly
fall
back
,
as
if
fainting
,
though

her
consciousness
;
and
,
what
be
strange

her
power
of
sight
remain

<EOS>
in
this
condition
she
fancy
invisible
form
be
move
about
her
.
<EOS>
strange
sound
seem
to
salute
her
ear
,
like
the
gibbering
of
ghost
,
and
she
think
she
feel
the
flapping
of
unseen
wing
around
her
.
 
<EOS>
all
at
once
her
attention
be
draw
--
she
know
not
why
--
towards
the
closet
,
and
from
out
it
she
fancy
she
see
issue
the
tall
dark
figure
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
she
see
him
;
for
her
imagination
could
not
body
forth
feature
charge
with
such
a
fiendish
expression
,
or
eye
of
such
unearthly
lustre
.
<EOS>
He
be
clothe
in
black
,
but
the
fashion
of
his
raiment
be
unlike
aught
she
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
His
stature
be
gigantic
,
and
a
pale
phosphoric
light
enshroud
him
.
<EOS>
as
he
advance
,
fork
lightning
shoot
into
the
room
,
and
the
thunder
split
overhead
.
<EOS>
the
owl
hoot
fearfully
,
quit
its
perch
,
and
fly
off
by
the
way
it
have
enter
the

<EOS>
the
Dark
Shape
come
on

<EOS>
It

beside
Mistress

and
she
prostrate
herself
before

<EOS>
the
gesture
of
the
figure
be
angry
and
imperious
--
those
of
Mistress
Nutter
supplicate
.
<EOS>
Their
converse
be
drown
by
the
rattling
of
the
storm
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
figure
point
to
Alizon
,
and
the
word
"
midnight
"
break
in
tone
loud
than
the
thunder
from
its
lip
.
<EOS>
all
consciousness
then
forsook
her
.
 
<EOS>
how
long
she
continue
in
this
state
she
know
not
,
but
the
touch
of
a
finger
apply
to
her
brow
seem
to
recall
her
suddenly
to
animation
.
<EOS>
She
heave
a
deep
sigh
,
and
look
around
.
<EOS>
a
wondrous
change
have
occur
.
<EOS>
the
storm
have
pass
off

and
the
moon
be

brightly
over
the
top
of

flood
the

with
its
gentle
radiance

while
her

with
look
of
tender
affection

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
You

it

<EOS>
this

Methought

<EOS>
Alizon

More

thus
the

Robin

between
two
pretty
female
morris

dancer

whose

Ned
Huddlestone

the

of
Friar

equally
fortunate

have
a
buxom
dame

<EOS>
from
the

it

highly
probable
he
would
be
under

Ned

like
the
burly
priest

have
a
stout
bullet

proof
against

the
copious

he
swallow

instead
of

only
tend
to
make
him
more
uproarious
.
<EOS>
bless
also
with
lusty
lung

his
shout

in
an
effort

fall

<EOS>
this

excess

for
though
the

forester

none

Lawrence

Tom

the

<EOS>
of

more

and
of
these
the
great
portion

young

good

looking

while
in
the
case

<EOS>
before

be
half
over

it
become
so
dark

it

find
necessary

Scarcely

to

a

even
this
be
only
do
with
the
view

exact
attention
on
the
part

their
swain

and
never
fail
in
effect

<EOS>
the
thunder
-
storm
,
therefore
,
instead
of
put
a
stop
to
the
general
enjoyment
,
only
tend
to
increase
it
.
<EOS>
however
the
last
peal
be
loud
enough
to
silence
the
most
uproarious
.
<EOS>
the

turn
pale

a

this

<EOS>
the
bearer
of
the
intelligence

after

dreadfully
frighten

have
see
a
bolt
strike
the
steeple

and
hear
some
stone

she

<EOS>
no

He

some

in

how

no

long

<EOS>
"
as
to
who
he

be
many
opinion

some
aver
he
be
Francis
Paslew

grandson
of
Francis
,
brother
to
the
abbot

and
be
a
Jesuit
priest

for
you
know

all
strictly
adhere

will
go
question

proceed
to

accompany
by

draw
near

during

the

glide
towards
a
side

door
at
the
upper
end
of
the
hall

pass
through
it

<EOS>
so
general
be
the
consternation

that
no

attempt
to
stay
him

nor
would
any
one
follow
to
see
whither
he
go

<EOS>
release

at
length

from

strong
grasp
of

rush
forth
,
and
not
return

Nicholas
,
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minute
,
go
in
search
of
him
,
but
come
back
presently
,
and
tell
the
old
steward
he
could
neither
find
him

the
monk

<EOS>
"
Master

will
be
back
anon

I
dare

Adam

"
he
remark
;
"
if
not
,
I
will
make
further
search
for
him

well
not
mention

mysterious
occurrence

Sir
Ralph

at

event
not
until

festivity

over

the
lady

retire

disturb

notice
just
now

that
yon
fearsome
monk
regard
him
more
attentively
than

bid
him
be
careful

conjure
you

Gregory

bestir
yourself

serve
supper
at
the
upper
table

trice

"
 
<EOS>
any
apprehension
Nicholas
may
entertain
for
Richard
be
at
this
moment
relieve
,
for
as
Sir
Ralph
and
his
guest
come
in
at
one
door
,
the
young
man
enter
by
another
.
<EOS>
He
look
deathly
pale
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
put
his
finger
to
his
lip
in
token
of
silence
--
a
gesture
which
the
other
signify
that
he
understand
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
and
his
guest
have
take
their
place
at
the
table
,
an
excellent
and
plentiful
repast
be
speedily
set
before
them
,
and
if
they
do
not
do
quite
such
ample
justice
to
it
as
the
hungry
rustic
at
the
low
board
have
do
to
the
good
thing
provide
for
them
,
the
cook
could
not
reasonably
complain
.
<EOS>
no
allusion
whatever
be
make
to
the
recent
strange
occurrence
,
the
cheerfulness
of
the
company
be
uninterrupted
;
but
the
noise
in
the
low
part
of
the
hall
have
in
a
great
measure
subside
,
partly
out
of
respect
to
the
host
,
and
partly
in
consequence
of
the
alarm
occasion
by
the
suppose
supernatural
visitation
.
<EOS>
Richard
continue
silent
and
preoccupied
,
and
neither
eat
nor
drank
;
but
Nicholas
appear
to
think
his
courage
would
be
best
sustain
by
an
extra
allowance
of
clary
and
sack
,
apply
himself
frequently
to
the
goblet
with
that
view
,
and
erelong
his
spirit
improve
so
wonderfully
,
and
his
natural
boldness
be
so
much
increase
,
that
he
be
ready
to
confront
Abbot
Paslew
,
or
any
other
abbot
of
them
all
,
wherever
they
may
chance
to
cross
him
.
<EOS>
in
this
enterprising
frame
of
mind
he
draw
Richard
aside
,
and
question
him
as
to
what
have
take
place
in
his
pursuit
of
the
mysterious
monk
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
overtook
him
,
Dick
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
"
and
put
it
to
him
roundly
why
he
come
hither
,
where
neither
ghost
nor
Jesuit
priest
,
whichever
he
may
be
,
be
want
.
<EOS>
what
answer
he
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Would
I
have
be
there
to
interrogate
him
!
<EOS>
He
should
have
declare
how
he
become
possessed
of
that
old
moth
-
eat
,
blood
-
stain
,
monkish
gown
,
or
I
would
have
unfrock
him
,
even
if
he
have
prove
to
be
a
skeleton
.
<EOS>
but
I
interrupt
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
tell
me
what
occur
at
the
interview
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no

gravely

no

Nicholas

<EOS>
s'blood

I
must
be
careful
,
for
Doctor
Ormerod
and
Parson
Dewhurst

within
hearing
,
and
may
lecture
me
on
the
wantonness
and
profanity
of
swear

<EOS>
by
Saint
Gregory
de
Northbury!--no
,
that
be
an
oath

,
what
be
bad

a
popish
oath

<EOS>
by
--
I
have
several
tremendous
imprecation
at
my
tongue

end

they
shall
not
out

It
be
a
sinful
propensity

must
be
control

<EOS>
in
a
word

then
,
you
let
him
escape

"
if
you
be
so
anxious
to
stay
him
,
I
wonder
you
come
not
with
me

"
reply
Richard
;
"
but
you
now
hold
very
different
language
from
what
you
use
when
I
quit
the
hall

<EOS>
"
ah
,
true

right

Dick

reply
Nicholas
;
"
my
sentiment
have
undergo
a
wonderful
change
since
then

I
now
regret
have
stop
you

by
my
troth

if
I
meet

confound
monk
again

he
shall
give
a
good
account

himself

I
promise
him

what
say
he
to
you

Dick
?
<EOS>
make
an
end
of
your

<EOS>
"
I
have
not
begin
it
yet

Richard

"
<EOS>
but
pay
attention
,
and
you
shall
hear
what
occur
.
<EOS>
when
I
rush
forth
,
the
monk
have
already
gain
the
entrance

hall
.
<EOS>
no
one
be
within
it
at
the
time
,
all
the
serving

man
be
busy
here
with
the
feasting
.
<EOS>
I
summon
him
to
stay
,
but
he
answer
not
,
and
,
still
grimly
regard
me
,
glide
towards
the
outer
door
,
which
(
I
know
not
by
what
chance
)
stand
open
,
and
pass
through
it
,
close
it
upon
me
.
<EOS>
this
delay
me
a
moment
;
and
when
I
get
out
,
he
have
already
descend
the
step
,
and
be
move
towards
the
garden
.
<EOS>
It
be
bright
moonlight
,
so
I
could
see
him
distinctly
.
<EOS>
and
mark
this
,
Nicholas
--
the
two
great
blood
-
hound
be
run
about
at
large
in
the
court
-
yard
,
but
they
slink
off
,
as
if
alarm
at
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
the
monk
have
now
gain
the
garden
,
and
be
shape
his
course
swiftly
towards
the
ruin
Conventual
Church
.
<EOS>
determine
to
overtake
him
,
I
quicken
my
pace
;
but
he
gain
the
old
fane
before
me
,
and
thread
the
broken
aisle
with
noiseless
celerity
.
<EOS>
in
the
choir
he
pause
and
confront
me
.
<EOS>
when
within
a
few
yard
of
him
,
I
pause
,
arrest
by
his
fix
and
terrible
gaze
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
,
his
look
freeze
my
blood
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
speak
,
but
I
could
not
.
<EOS>
My
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
for
very
fear
.
<EOS>
before
I
could
shake
off
this
apprehension
the
figure
raise
its
hand
menacingly

this

rare

give
you

I

object

to
your
dancing
with
Alizon
Device

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
"
cry
Nicholas

"
why
should
I
not
dance
with

what
right
<EOS>
hast
thou
to
forbid
me
Alizon
?
<EOS>
troth
,
lad

art
thou
<EOS>
so
ignorant
of
human
nature

not
to
know
that
forbid
fruit

the
sweetest

so

fall

now

the
more
bent

with

prohibit
damsel

I

know
the
principle

thou
erectest
thyself

it
because

faint
when
thy

head
fool

Sir

that
thou
flatter
thyself
<EOS>
she
be
in
love

thee

<EOS>
be
not

sure
of
it

Dick

<EOS>
many
a
timid
wench
have
swoon
at
the
sight
of
a
naked
weapon

without
be
enamour
of
the
swordsman

<EOS>
the
fainting
prove
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
grant
she
love
thee
--
<EOS>
what
then
!
<EOS>
an
end
must
speedily
come
of
it
;
so
well
finish
at
once
,
before
she
be
entangle
in
a
mesh
from
which
she
can
not
be
extricate
without
danger
.
<EOS>
for
hark
thee
,
Dick

whatever
thou
mayst
think

<EOS>
I

not

far
go

my

much
obscure

plainly
enough

thee

see
through
you

matter
must
go
no
further

have
go
too
far
already

night

must
see
her
no
more

serious
in
this

serious

inter
pocula

such
a
thing
can
be

to
observe
caution

this

soberly

you
heartily

your

at

will
at

I
love
Alizon

her

you
may
rest
assured
I
would
sacrifice
my
life
a
thousand
time
rather

endanger
her
happiness

there
be
a
point
in
her
history

with
which
if
you
be
acquaint

it
may
alter
your
view

Nicholas

I
leave

sadly

out

off

sad
business
it

die
of
it

I
make
quite
sure
that
the
devoted
girl
would
die
first

in

we
be
to
occupy
the

grave

I
be
not

to
such
a

extremity

before

keep
house
a
week

Jack
Walker

the
keeper
of
Downham

make
his
appearance
in
my
room

after
tell
me

the
mischief
do
by
a
pair
of
otter
in

Ribble

find
me
in

very
desponding
state

venture
to
inquire

hear
the
news

<EOS>
expect
to
hear
of
the
death

I
prepare
myself
for
an
outburst
of
grief

resolve
to
give
immediate
direction
for

recover
at

Alizon

the
hall

<EOS>
Richard
endeavour
to
read
in
the
young
girl
's
countenance
some
intimation
of
what
have
pass
between
her
and
Mistress
Nutter
,
but
he
only
remark
that
she
be
paler
than
before
,
and
have
trace
of
anxiety
about
her
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
also
look
gloomy
and
thoughtful
,
and
there
be
nothing
in
the
manner
or
deportment
of
either
to
lead
to
the
conclusion
,
that
a
discovery
of
relationship
between

have
take
place

as

move
on
,

instantly
call
off
her

while

bumper
,
and
,
utter
the
name
of
the

drain
it
to

<EOS>
this
time
he
be
quite
certain
he
receive
a
significant
glance
in
return
,
and
no
one
be
near
to
contradict
him
,
he
go
on
indulge
the
idea
of
an
amorous
understanding
between
himself
and
the

till
he
have
finish
the

obtain
as
many

be
readily
suppose
under
the
circumstance
,
this
part
of

entertainment
be
distasteful
to
both
of

;
but
it
could
not
be
avoid
without
enter
into
explanation
,
which
Mistress
Nutter
be
unwilling
to
make
,
and
she
,
therefore
,
counsel
her
daughter
to
act
in
all
respect
as
if
she
be
still
Alizon
Device
,

in
no

the

Pavane

a
favourite
with

Virgin
Queen

which
I
should
like

polka

solemn
tune

accord
to
Sir
John

"
 
<EOS>
be
not
this
very
much
like
a
waltz
?
<EOS>
yes
,
lady
,
you
have
be
dance
the
lavolta
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
century
without
be
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
another
waltz
still
old
,
call
the
Sauteuse
,
which
I
suspect
answer
to
your
favourite
polka
.
<EOS>
then
there
be

kiss
dance
,
and
round
,
any
of
which
be
well
than
the
objectionable
polka
.
<EOS>
thus
you
will
see
that
there
be
infinite
variety
at
least
at
the
period
under
consideration
,
and
that
you
have
rather
retrograde
than
advanced
in
the
saltatory
art
.
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
ball
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nicholas
Assheton
<EOS>
,
I
have
say
,
excel
in
the
graceful
accomplishment
of
dancing
,
and
that
be
probably
the
reason
why
she
have
be
select
for
the

Sir
Ralph

who
know
the
value
of
a
good

by
many
person
she
be

the
handsome
woman
in
the

in
dignity
of
carriage
she
be
certainly
unrivalled
.
<EOS>
this
be
precisely
what
Sir
Ralph
require
,
and
have
execute
a
few
"
current
traverse
and
slide
passage
"
with
her
,
with
a
gravity
and
stateliness
worthy
of
Sir
Christopher
Hatton
himself
,
when
grace
by
the
hand
of
his
sovereign
mistress
,
he
conduct
her
,
amid
the
hushed
admiration
of
the
beholder

they
come
in
for
the
large

admiration

if
the

she
make
up

afford
ample

what
be

Mrs.
Nutter
think
it
a
fitting
opportunity

adopt
the
young

though
Sir
Ralph
seem
a
good
deal
surprise
at
the
suddenness
of
the
declaration
,
he
raise
no
objection
to
the
plan

,
on
the
contrary
,
applaud
it
.
<EOS>

another

by
no

dispose
to
regard
it
in
an
equally
favourable
light

Master
Potts

set

detect
Jennet

resolve
,
by

otherwise

to
extract
all

the
dance
over
,
Richard
and
his

wander
towards
a
more
retired
part

the
hall

<EOS>
"
why
do
your
sister
shun
me
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Alizon
,
with
a
look
of
great
distress
.
<EOS>
"
what
can
I
have
do
to
offend
her
?
<EOS>
whenever
I
regard
her
she
avert
her
head
,
and
as
I
approach
her
just
now
,
she
move
away
,
make
it
evident
she
design
to
avoid
me
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
think
myself
in
any
way
different
from
what
I
be
this
morning
,
when
she
treat
me
with
such
unbounded
confidence
and
kindness
,
or
accuse
myself
of
any
offence
towards
her
,
even
in
thought
,
I
could
understand
it
;
but
as
it
be
,
her
present
coldness
appear
inexplicable
and
unreasonable
,
and
give
me
great
pain
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
forfeit
her
regard
for
world
,
and
therefore
beseech
you
to
tell
me
what
I
have
do
amiss
,
that
I
may
endeavour
to
repair
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
do
nothing
--
nothing
whatever

sweet
girl

reply
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
caprice
on
Dorothy
's
part
,
and
except
that
it
distress
you
,
her
conduct
,
which
you
justly
call
'
unreasonable
,
'
do
not
deserve
a
moment

serious
consideration

<EOS>
"
oh
no
!
<EOS>
you
can
not
deceive
me
thus
,
"
cry
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
too
kind
--
too
well
-
judge
,
to
be
capricious
.
<EOS>
something
must
have
occur
to
make
her
change
her
opinion
of
me
,
though
what
it
be
<EOS>
I
can
not
conjecture
.
<EOS>
I
have
gain
much
to

day
--
more
than
I
have
any
right
to
expect
;
but
if
I
have
forfeit
the
good
opinion
of
your
sister

the
loss
of
her
friendship
will
counterbalance
all
the
rest

<EOS>

you
have
not
lose
it

Alizon

Richard

earnestly

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dorothy
have
get
some
strange
notion
into
her
head
,
which
only
require
to
be
combat
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
like
Mistress
Nutter
,

be
pique
and
displease
by
the
extraordinary
interest
which
that
lady
display
towards
you

that
be
all

why
should
she
not

Mistress
Nutter
?
"
inquire
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
there
be
no
accounting
for
fancy
,
"
return
Richard
,
with
a
faint
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
attempt
to
defend
her
,
but
simply
offer
the
only
excuse
in
my
power
for
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
concerned
to
hear
it
,
"
say
Alizon
,
sadly
,
"
because
henceforth
I
shall
be
so
intimately
connect
with
Mistress
Nutter
,
that
this
estrangement
,
which
I
hope
arise
only
from
some
trivial
cause
,
and
merely
require
a
little
explanation
to
be
set
aside
,
may
become
widened
and
lasting
.
<EOS>
owe
every
thing
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
I
must
espouse
her
cause
;
and
if
your
sister
like
her
not
,
she
like
me
not
in
consequence
,
and
therefore
we
must
continue
divide
.
<EOS>
but
surely
her
dislike
be
of
very
recent
date
,
and
can
not
have
any
strong
hold
upon
her
;
for
when
she
and
Mistress
Nutter
meet
this
morning
,
a
very
different
feeling
seem
to
animate
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
,
indeed
,
it
do

reply
Richard
,
visibly
embarrassed

distressed

"
<EOS>
and
since
you
have
make
me
acquaint
with
the
new
tie

you
have

I
can
only
regret
allude
to
the
circumstance

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
you
may
not

me

say
Alizon
,
"
I
will
explain
the
extent
of
my
obligation
to
Mistress
Nutter

then
you
will
perceive
how
much
I
be
bounden
to
her

<EOS>
Childless
herself

greatly
interested

it
not

anxiously

me
further

little

speak

what

out

have
sway
her

I
have

they
do

Alizon
;

that
wish

no

have
great
weight
with
her

<EOS>
nay

notwithstanding

she
have
kindly
consent
to
use
her
good

weight
you
have

from

joyfully

I
will
tell
Dorothy

You

certainly

not

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
You

me
into
an
infinitude
of

for
you

which
shall
be
use
with

<EOS>
tired

to
a
sudden
halt

address
the
piper
as
Nicholas
have
address
him
,
and
receive
a
like
answer
,
summon
the
delinquent
to
come
forward
;
but
as
he
kneel
down
on
the
cushion
,
instead
of
receive
the
anticipate
salute
,
he
get
a
sound
box
on

actuate
probably
by
some
feeling
of
jealousy
,
take
advantage
of
the
favourable
opportunity
afford
her
of

herself
.
<EOS>
no

could
refrain
from
laugh
at
this
unexpected
turn
in
affair

and
Nicholas

do
him
justice
,
take
it
in
excellent
part
,
and
laugh
louder
than
the
rest

<EOS>
spring
to
his
foot
,
he
snatch
the
kiss
deny
him
by
the
spirited
dame
,
and
lead
her
to
obtain
some
refreshment
at
the
low
table
,
of
which
they
both
stand
in
need
,
while
the
cushion
be
appropriate
by
other
couple
,
other
box
on
the
ear
and
kiss

interchange

lead
to
an

forth
excuse

be

there
be
nothing

"
 
<EOS>
"
I

Nicholas

with
a
hollow
laugh

and
in
a
dismally
deep
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
Isole
herself

<EOS>
I
be
foolhardy
enough
to
invite
her

<EOS>
She
smile

at
me
thus

<EOS>
and
he

away
with
a
rapid
but
uncertain
step

<EOS>
"
the
potent

,
"

Richard
.
<EOS>
"
I
must

<EOS>
and
,
wave
his

to
his
sister

he
follow
the
squire
,
who
move
on
,
stare
inquisitively
into
the
countenance
of
every
pretty
damsel
he
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
Time
have
fly
fleetly
with
Dorothy
and
Alizon
,
who
,
occupy
with
each
other
,
have
take
little
note
of
its
progress
,
and
be
surprised
to
find
how
quickly
the
hour
have
go
by
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
several
dance
have
be
perform
;
a
Morisco
,
in
which
all
the
May
-
day
reveller
take
part
,
with
the
exception
of
the
queen
herself
,
who
,
notwithstanding
the
united
entreaties
of
Robin
Hood
and
her
gentleman
-
usher
,
could
not
be
prevail
upon
to
join
it
:
a
trenchmore
,
a
sort
of
long
country
-
dance
,
extend
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
hall
,
and
in
which
the
whole
of
the
rustic
stand
up
:
a
galliard
,
confine
to
the
more
important
guest
,
and
in
which
both
Alizon
and
Dorothy
be
include
,
the
former
dancing
,
of
course
,
with
Richard
,
and
the
latter
with
one
of
her
cousin
,
young
Joseph
Robinson
:
and
a
jig
,
quite
promiscuous
and
unexclusive
,
and
not
the
less
merry
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
,
what
with
the
dance
,
which
be
of
some
duration
--
the
trenchmore
alone
occupy
more
than
an
hour
--
and
the
necessary
breathing
-
time
between
them
,
it
be
on
the
stroke
of
ten
without
any
body
be
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
now
this
,
though
a
very
early
hour
for
a
modern
party
,
be
about
the
time
when
the
first
guest
would
arrive
,
be
a
very
late
one
even
in
fashionable
assemblage
at
the
period
in
question
,
and
the
guest
begin
to
think
of
retire
,
when
the
brawl
,
intend
to
wind
up
the
entertainment
,
be
call
.
<EOS>
the
high
animation
still
prevail
throughout
the
company
,
for
the
generous
host
have
take
care
that
the
interval
between
the
dance
should
be
well
fill
up
with
refreshment
,
and
large
bowl
of
spice
wine
,
with
burn
orange
and
crab
float
in
them
,
be
place
on
the
side
-
table
,
and
liberally
dispense
to
all
applicant
.
<EOS>
thus
all
seem
destine
to
be
bring
to
a
happy
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
throughout
the
evening
Alizon
have
be
closely
watch
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
who
remark
,
with
feeling
akin
to
jealousy
and
distrust
,
the
mark
predilection
exhibit
by
her
for
Richard
and
Dorothy
Assheton
,
as
well
as
her
inattention
to
her
own
express
injunction
in
remain
constantly
near
them
.
<EOS>
though
secretly
displease
by
this
,
she
put
a
calm
face
upon
it
,
and
neither
remonstrate
by
word
or
look
.
<EOS>
thus
Alizon
,
feel
encourage
in
the
course
she
have
adopt
,
and
prompt
by
her
inclination
,
soon
forget
the
interdiction
she
have
receive
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
even
go
so
far
in
her
duplicity
as
to
promise
Dorothy
,
that
Alizon
should
pay
her
an
early
visit
at
Middleton
--
though
inwardly
resolve
no
such
visit
should
ever
take
place
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
now
receive
the
proposal
very
graciously
,
and
make
Alizon
quite
happy
in
accede
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
fain
have
her
go
back
with
me
to
Middleton
when
I
return
,
"
say
Dorothy
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
fear
you
would
not
like
to
part
with
your
newly
-
adopt
daughter
so
soon
;
neither
would
it
be
quite
fair
to
rob
you
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
hold
you
to
your
promise
of
an
early
visit
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
reply
by
a
bland
smile
,
and
then
observe
to
Alizon
that
it
be
time
for
them
to
retire
,
and
that
she
have
stay
on
her
account
far
later
than
she
intend
--
a
mark
of
consideration
duly
appreciate
by
Alizon
.
<EOS>
farewell
for
the
night

between
the
two

this
very
juncture

<EOS>
before

and

,
but

in
a
chair
at
one
corner
of

,
and
could
not
be
waken
,
she
instantly
fly
thither
and
try
to
rouse
her
,
but
in
vain
;
when
Mistress
Nutter
,
come
up
the
next
moment
,
merely
touch
her
brow
,
and
the
little
girl
open
her
eye
and
gaze
about
her
with
a
bewilder
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
unused
to
these
late
hour
,
poor
child
,
"
say
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
some
one
must
be
find
to
take
her
home
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
go
far
in
search
of
a
convoy
,
"
say
Potts
,
who
have
be
hover
about

and
now
step
up
;
"
I
be
go
to
the
Dragon
myself
,
and
shall
be
happy
to
take
charge
of
her

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You

officious

"
rejoin
Mistress

coldly
;
"
when

<EOS>
My

Simon
Blackadder

<EOS>
during

this
time

Mistress

her
eye
steadily
fix
on
the
little
girl

an
ireful
and
piercing
look
at
him
,
which
seem
to
produce
much
the

consequence
as
those

for

CHAPTER
x.--the
NOCTURNAL
MEETING
.
  
<EOS>
on
gain
the
head
of
the
staircase
lead
to
the
corridor
,
Mistress
Nutter
,
whose
movement
have
hitherto
be
extremely
rapid
,
pause
with
her
daughter
to
listen
to
the
sound
arise
from
below
.
<EOS>
suddenly
be
hear
a
loud
cry
,
and
the
music
,
which
have
wax
fast
and
furious
in
order
to
keep
pace
with
the
frenzied
bounding
of
the
squire
,
cease
at
once
,
show
some
interruption
have
occur
,
while
from
the
confused
noise
that
ensue
,
it
be
evident
the
sudden
stoppage
have
be
the
result
of
accident
.
<EOS>
with
blanch
cheek
Alizon
listen
,
scarcely
daring
to
look
at
her
mother
,
whose
expression
of
countenance
,
reveal
by
the
lamp
she
hold
in
her
hand
,
almost
frighten
her
;
and
it
be
a
great
relief
to
hear
the
voice
and
laughter
of
the
serving
-
man
as
they
come
forth
with
Nicholas
,
and
bear
him
towards
another
part
of
the
mansion
;
and
though
much
shocked
,
she
be
glad
when
one
of
them
,
who
appear
to
be
Nicholas
's
own
servant
,
assure
the
other
"
that
it
be
only
a
drunken
fit
and
that
the
squire
would
wake
up
next
morning
as
if
nothing
have
happen
.
"
 
<EOS>
apparently
satisfied
with
this
explanation
,
Mistress
Nutter
move
on
;
but
a
new
feeling
of
uneasiness
come
over
Alizon
as
she
follow
her
down
the
long
dusky
corridor
,
in
the
direction
of
the
mysterious
chamber
,
where
they
be
to
pass
the
night
.
<EOS>
the
fitful
flame
of
the
lamp
fall
upon
many
a
grim
painting
depict
the
suffering
of
the
early
martyr
;
and
these
ghastly
representation
do
not
serve
to
re
-
assure
her
.
<EOS>
the
grotesque
carving
on
the
panel
and
rib
of
the
vaulted
roof
,
likewise
impress
her
with
vague
terror
,
and
there
be
one
large
piece
of
sculpture
--
Saint
Theodora
subject
to
diabolical
temptation
,
as
describe
in
the
Golden
Legend
--
that
absolutely
scare
her
.
<EOS>
Their
footstep
echo
hollowly
overhead
,
and
more
than
once
,
deceive
by
the
sound
,
Alizon
turn
to
see
if
any
one
be
behind
them
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
lie
the
room
once
occupy
by
the
superior
of
the
religious
establishment
,
and
still
know
from
that
circumstance
as
the
"
Abbot
's
Chamber
.
<EOS>
"
connect
with
this
apartment
be
the
beautiful
oratory
build
by
Paslew
,
wherein
he
have
keep
his
last
vigil
;
and
though
now
no
longer
apply
to
purpose
of
worship
,
still
wear
from
the
character
of
its
architecture
,
its
sculptured
ornament
,
and
the
paint
glass
in
its
casement
,
a
dim
religious
air
.
<EOS>
the
abbot
's
room
be
allot
to
Dorothy
Assheton
;
and
from
its
sombre
magnificence
,
as
well
as
the
ghostly
tale
connect
with
it
,
have
impress
her
with
so
much
superstitious
misgiving
,
that
she
beseech
Alizon
to
share
her
couch
with
her
,
but
the
young
girl
do
not
dare
to
assent
.
<EOS>
just
,
however
,
as
Mistress
Nutter
be
about
to
enter
her
own
room
,
Dorothy
appear
on
the
corridor
,
and
,
call
to
Alizon
to
stay
a
moment
,
fly
quickly
towards
her
,
and
renew
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
Alizon
look
at
her
mother
,
but
the
latter
decidedly
,
and
somewhat
sternly
,
negative
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
girl
then
say
good
-
night
,
kiss
each
other
affectionately
,
after
which
Alizon
enter
the
room
with
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
the
door
be
close
.
<EOS>
two
taper
be
burn
on
the
dressing
-
table
,
and
their
light
fall
upon
the
carve
figure
of
the
wardrobe
,
which
still
exercise
the
same
weird
influence
over
her
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
neither
seem
disposed
to
retire
to
rest
immediately
,
nor
willing
to
talk
,
but
sit
down
,
and
be
soon
lose
in
thought
.
<EOS>
after
awhile
,
an
impulse
of
curiosity
which
she
could
not
resist
,
prompt
Alizon
to
peep
into
the
closet
,
and
push
aside
the
tapestry
,
partly
draw
over
the
entrance
,
she
hold
the
lamp
forward
so
as
to
throw
its
light
into
the
little
chamber
.
<EOS>
a
mere
glance
be
all
she
be
allow
,
but
it
suffice
to
show
her
the
large
oak
chest
,
though
the
monkish
robe
lately
suspend
above
it
,
and
which
have
particularly
attract
her
attention
,
be
go
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
have
notice
the
movement
,
and
instantly
and
somewhat
sharply
recall
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
Alizon
obey
,
a
slight
tap
be
hear
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
young
girl
turn
pale
,
for
in
her
present
frame
of
mind
any
little
matter
affect
her
.
<EOS>
nor
be
her
apprehension
materially
allay
by
the
entrance
of
Dorothy
,
who
,
look
white
as
a
sheet
,
say
she
do
not
dare
to
remain
in
her
own
room
,
have
be
terribly
frightened
,
by
see
a
monkish
figure
in
moulder
white
garment
,
exactly
resemble
one
of
the
carve
image
on
the
wardrobe
,
issue
from
behind
the
hanging
on
the
wall
,
and
glide
into
the
oratory
,
and
she
entreat
Mistress
Nutter
to
let
Alizon
go
back
with
her
.
<EOS>
the
request
be
peremptorily
refuse
,
and
the
lady
,
ridicule
Dorothy
for
her
fear
,
bade
her
return
;
but
she
still
linger
.
<EOS>
this
relation
fill
Alizon
with
inexpressible
alarm
,
for
though
she
do
not
dare
to
allude
to
the
disappearance
of
the
monkish
gown
,
she
could
not
help
connect
the
circumstance
with
the
ghostly
figure
see
by
Dorothy
.
 
<EOS>
unable
otherwise
to
get
rid
of
the
terrified
intruder
,
whose
presence
be
an
evident
restraint
to
her
,
Mistress
Nutter
,
at
length
,
consent
to
accompany
her
to
her
room
,
and
convince
her
of
the
folly
of
her
fear
,
by
an
examination
of
the
oratory
.
<EOS>
Alizon
go
with
them
,
her
mother
not
choose
to
leave
her
behind
,
and
indeed
she
herself
be
most
anxious
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
the
abbot
's
chamber
be
large
and
gloomy
,
nearly
twice
the
size
of
the
room
occupy
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
but
resemble
it
in
many
respect
,
as
well
as
in
the
no
interdusky
hue
of
its
hanging
and
furniture
,
most
of
which
have
be
undisturbed
since
the
day
of
Paslew
.
<EOS>
the
very
bed
,
of
carve
oak
,
be
that
in
which
he
have
sleep
,
and
his
arm
be
still
display
upon
it
,
and
on
the
paint
glass
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
as
Alizon
enter
she
look
round
with
apprehension
,
but
nothing
occur
to
justify
her
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
have
raise
the
arra
,
from
behind
which
Dorothy
aver
the
figure
have
issue
,
and
discover
nothing
but
a
panel
of
oak
;
with
a
smile
of
incredulity
,
Mistress
Nutter
walk
boldly
towards
the
oratory
,
the
two
girl
,
hand
in
hand
,
follow
tremblingly
after
her
;
but
no
fearful
object
meet
their
view
.
<EOS>
a
dressing
-
table
,
with
a
large
mirror
upon
it
,
occupy
the
spot
where
the
altar
have
formerly
stand
;
but
,
in
spite
of
this
,
and
of
other
furniture
,
the
little
place
of
prayer
,
as
have
previously
be
observe
,
retain
much
of
its
original
character
,
and
seem
more
calculated
to
inspire
sentiment
of
devotional
awe
than
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
after
remain
for
a
short
time
in
the
oratory
,
during
which
she
point
out
the
impossibility
of
any
one
be
conceal
there
,
Mistress
Nutter
assure
Dorothy
she
may
rest
quite
easy
that
nothing
further
would
occur
to
alarm
her
,
and
recommend
her
to
lose
the
sense
of
her
fear
as
speedily
as
she
could
in
sleep
,
take
her
departure
with
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
recommendation
be
of
little
avail
.
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
's
heart
die
within
her
,
and
all
her
former
terror
return
,
and
with
additional
force
.
<EOS>
sit
down
,
she
look
fixedly
at
the
hanging
till
her
eye
ache
,
and
then
cover
her
face
with
her
hand
,
and
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
,
she
listen
intently
for
the
slight
sound
.
<EOS>
a
rustle
would
have
make
her
scream
--
but
all
be
still
as
death
,
so
profoundly
quiet
,
that
the
very
hush
and
silence
become
a
new
cause
of
disquietude
,
and
longing
for
some
cheerful
sound
to
break
it
,
she
would
have
speak
aloud
but
from
a
fear
of
hear
her
own
voice
.
<EOS>
a
book
lie
before
her
,
and
she
essay
to
read
it
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
be
ever
glance
fearfully
round
--
ever
listen
intently
.
<EOS>
this
state
could
not
endure
for
ever
,
and
feel
a
drowsiness
steal
over
her
she
yield
to
it
,
and
at
length
drop
asleep
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
Her
dream
,
however
,
be
influence
by
her
mental
condition
,
and
slumber
be
no
refuge
,
as
promise
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
from
the
haunting
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
a
jarring
sound
arouse
her
,
and
she
find
she
have
be
awaken
by
the
clock
striking
twelve
.
<EOS>
Her
lamp
require
trim
and
burn
dimly
,
but
by
its
imperfect
light
she
see
the
arra
move
.
<EOS>
this
could
be
no
fancy
,
for
the
next
moment
the
hanging
be
raise
,
and
a
figure
look
from
behind
them
;
and
this
time
it
be
not
the
monk
,
but
a
female
robe
in
white
.
<EOS>
a
glimpse
of
the
figure
be
all
Dorothy
catch
,
for
it
instantly
retreat
,
and
the
tapestry
fall
back
to
its
place
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
scare
by
this
apparition
,
Dorothy
rush
out
of
the
room
so
hurriedly
that
she
forget
to
take
her
lamp
,
and
make
her
way
,
she
scarcely
know
how
,
to
the
adjoining
chamber
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
tap
at
the
door
,
but
try
it
,
and
find
it
unfastened
,
open
it
softly
,
and
close
it
after
her
,
resolve
if
the
occupant
of
the
room
be
asleep
not
to
disturb
them
,
but
to
pass
the
night
in
a
chair
,
the
presence
of
some
live
being
beside
her
sufficing
,
in
some
degree
,
to
dispel
her
terror
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
bury
in
darkness
,
the
taper
be
extinguish
.
 
<EOS>
advance
on
tiptoe
she
soon
discover
a
seat
,
when
what
be
her
surprise
to
find
Alizon
asleep
within
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
it
be
Alizon
--
for
she
have
touch
her
hair
and
face
,
and
she
feel
surprised
that
the
contact
have
not
awaken
her
.
<EOS>
still
more
surprised
<EOS>
do
she
feel
that
the
young
girl
have
not
retire
to
rest
.
<EOS>
again
she
step
forward
in
search
of
another
chair
,
when
a
gleam
of
light
suddenly
shoot
from
one
side
of
the
bed
,
and
the
tapestry
,
mask
the
entrance
to
the
closet

<EOS>
from
behind
it

the
next
moment

appear
the
same
female
figure
,
robe
in
white
,
that
she
have
previously
behold
in
the
abbot

chamber

<EOS>
the
figure
hold
a
lamp
in
one
hand
,
and
a
small
box
in
the
other
,
and
,
to
her
unspeakable
horror
,
disclose
the
livid
and
contort
countenance
of
Mistress
Nutter

<EOS>
during
this
invocation
,
the
glee
of
the
assemblage
cease
,
and
they
look
around
in
hushed
expectation
of
the
result
.
<EOS>
slowly
then
do
a
long
procession
of
monkish
form
,
robe
in
white
,
glide
along
the
aisle
,
and
gather
round
the
altar
.
<EOS>
the
brass
-
cover
stone
within
the
presbytery
be
lift
up
,
as
if
they
move
on
hinge
,
and
from
the
yawning
grave
beneath
them
arise
solemn
shape
,
sixteen
in
number
,
each
with
mitre
on
head
and
crosi
in
hand
,
which
likewise
proceed
to
the
altar
.
<EOS>
then
a
loud
cry
be
hear
,
and
from
a
side
chapel
burst
the
monkish
form
,
in
moulder
garment
,
which
Dorothy
have
see
enter
the
oratory
,
and
which
would
have
mingle
with
its
brother
at
the
altar
,
but
they
wave
it
off
menacingly
.
<EOS>
another
piercing
shriek
follow
,
and
a
female
shape
,
habit
like
a
nun
,
and
of
surpass
loveliness
,
issue
from
the
opposite
chapel
,
and
hover
near
the
fire
.
<EOS>
content
with
this
proof
of
her
power
,
Mother
Chattox
wave
her
hand
,
and
the
long
shadowy
train
glide
off
as
they
come
.
<EOS>
the
ghostly
abbot
return
to
their
tomb
,
and
the
stone
close
over
them
.
<EOS>
but
the
shade
of
Paslew
and
Isole
de
Heton
still
linger
.
 
<EOS>
the
storm
have
wellnigh
cease
,
the
thunder
roll
hollowly
at
interval
,
and
a
flash
of
lightning
now
and
then
lick
the
wall
.
<EOS>
the
weird
crew
have
resume
their
rite
,
when
the
door
of
the
Lacy
chapel
fly
open
,
and
a
tall
female
figure
come
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
doubt
if
she
behold
aright
.
<EOS>
Could
that
terrific
woman
in
the
strangely
-
fashioned
robe
of
white
,
girt
by
a
brazen
zone
grave
with
mystic
character
,
with
a
long
glitter
blade

infernal
fury
in

roll
orb

the
livid
hue
of
death
on

cheek

and
the
red
brand
upon
her
brow

could
that
fearful
woman
,
with
the
black
dishevel
tress
float
over
her
bare
shoulder
,
and
whose
gesture
be
so
imperious
,
be
Mistress
Nutter
?
<EOS>
mother
no
longer
,
if
it
indeed
be
she
!
<EOS>
how
come
she
there
amid
that
weird
assemblage
?
<EOS>
why
do
they
so
humbly
salute
her
,
and
fall
prostrate
before
her
,
kiss
the
hem
of
her
garment
?
<EOS>
why
do
she
stand
proudly
in
the
midst
of
them
,
and
extend
her
hand
,
arm
with
the
knife
,
over
them
?
<EOS>
be
she
their
sovereign
mistress
,
that
they
bend
so
lowly
at
her
coming
,
and
rise
so
reverentially
at
her
bidding
?
<EOS>
be
this
terrible
woman
,
now
seat
oh
a
dilapidated
tomb
,
and
regard
the
dark
conclave
with
the
eye
of
a
queen
who
hold
their
life
in
her
hand
--
<EOS>
be
she
her
mother
?
<EOS>
oh
,
no!--no!--it
could
not
be

<EOS>
It
must
be
some
fiend
that
usurp
her
likeness
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
though
Alizon
thus
strove
to
discredit
the
evidence
of
her
sense
,
and
to
hold
all
she
see
to
be
delusion
,
and
the
work
of
darkness
,
she
could
not
entirely
convince
herself
,
but
imperfectly
recall
the
fearful
vision
she
have
witness
during
her
former
stupor
,
begin
to
connect
it
with
the
scene
now
pass
before
her
.
<EOS>
the
storm
have
wholly
cease
,
and
the
star
again

down
through
the
shatter
roof

<EOS>

,
break
only
by
the
hiss
and
bubbling
of
the
caldron
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
's
gaze
be
rivet
upon
her
mother
,
whose
slight
gesture
she
watch
.
<EOS>
after
number
the
assemblage
thrice
,
Mistress
Nutter
majestically
arise
,
and
motion
Mother
Chattox
towards
her
,
the
old
witch
tremblingly
advance
,
and
some
word
pass
between
them
,
the
import
of
which
do
not
reach
the
listener
's
ear
.
<EOS>
in
conclusion
,
however
,
Mistress
Nutter
exclaim
aloud
,
in
accent
of
command--"Go
,
bring
it
at
once
,
the
sacrifice

be

<EOS>
"--And
on
this
,
Mother
Chattox
hobble
off
to
one
of
the
side
chapel
.
 
<EOS>
a
mortal
terror
seize
Alizon
,
and
she
could
scarcely
draw
breath

<EOS>
dark
tale
have
be
tell
her
that
unbaptised
infant
be
sometimes
sacrifice
by

,
and
their
flesh
boil
and
devour
at
their
impious
banquet
,
and
dreading
lest
some
such
atrocity
be
now
about
to
be
practise
,
she
muster
all
her
resolution
,
determine
,
at
any
risk
,
to
interfere
,
and
,
if
possible
,
prevent
its
accomplishment

<EOS>
in
another
moment
,
Mother
Chattox
return

some
live
thing
,
wrap
in
a
white
cloth
,
which
struggle
feebly
for
liberation
,
apparently
confirm
Alizon
's
suspicion
,
and
she
be
about
to
rush
forward
,
when
Mistress
Nutter
,
snatch
the
bundle
from
the
old
witch
,
open
it
,
and
disclose
a
beautiful
bird
,
with
plumage
white
as
drive
snow
,
whose
leg
be
tie
together
,
so
that
it
could
not
escape

<EOS>
conjecture
what
be
to
follow
,
Alizon
avert
her
eye
,
and
when
she
look
round
again
the
bird

,
while
Mother
Chattox
be
in
the
act
of
throw
its
body
into
the
caldron
,
mutter
a
charm
as
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
hold
the
ensanguine
knife
aloft
,
and
cast
some
ruddy
drop
upon
the
glow
ember
,
pronounce
,
as
they
hiss
and
smoke
,

follow
adjuration:--

<EOS>
an
immediate
response
be
make
by
an
awful
voice
issue
apparently
from
the
bowel
of
the
earth

<EOS>
"

in

accents:--

Alizon

Her

<EOS>
a

<EOS>
brightly
shine
the
sun
upon
the
fair
Calder
as
it
wind
along
the
green
mead
above
the
bridge
,
as
it
rush
rejoicingly
over
the
weir
,
and
pursue
its
rapid
course
through
the
broad
plain
below
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
a
few
white
vapour

upon
the
summit
of
Whalley

with
gold
,
and
tip
with
fire
the
tree

top
that
pierce
through
them
,
augur
their
speedy
dispersion
.
<EOS>
so
beautiful
,
so
tranquil
,
look
the
old
monastic
fane
,
that
none
would
have
deem
its
midnight
rest
have
be
break
by
the
impious
rite
of
a
foul
troop
.
<EOS>
the
choir
,
where
the
unearthly
scream
and
the
demon
laughter
have
resound
,
be
now
vocal
with
the
melody
of
the
blackbird
,
the
thrush
,
and
other
songster
of
the
grove

<EOS>
bell
of

glitter
upon

and
gem
the
countless
spider

webs
stretch
from
bough
to

all
unbroken

<EOS>
no
trace
be
visible
on
the
sod
where
the
unhallowed
crew
have
dance
their
round
;
nor
be
any
ashe
leave
where
the
fire
have
burn
and
the
caldron
have
bubble
.
<EOS>
the
brass

cover
tomb
of
the
abbot
in
the
presbytery
look
as
if
a
century
have
pass
over

without
disturbance
;
while
the
grave

obliterate
,
and
only

when
a
broken
coffin
or
a
mouldering
bone
be
turn
up
by
the
tiller
of
the
ground
,
preserve
their
wonte
appearance
.
<EOS>
the
face
of
nature
have
receive
neither
impress
nor
injury
from
the
fantastic
freak
and
necromantic
exhibition
of
the
witch

<EOS>
every
thing
look
as
it
be
leave
overnight
;
and
the
only
footprint
to
be
detect
be
those
of
the
two
girl
,
and
of
the
party
who
come
in
quest
of
them
.
<EOS>
all
else
have
pass
by
like
a
vision
or
a
dream
.
<EOS>
the
rook
caw
loudly
in
the
neighbouring
tree
,
as
if
discuss
the
question
of
breakfast
,
and
the
jackdaw
wheel
merrily
round
the
tall
spire
,
which
spring
from
the
eastern
end
of
the
fane
.
 
<EOS>
brightly
shine
the
sun
upon
the
noble
timber
embower
the
mansion
of
the
assheton

upon
the
ancient
gateway
,
in
the
upper
chamber
of
which
<EOS>
Ned
Huddlestone

and
the
burly
representative
of
Friar
Tuck
,

sleepy
eye

preparatory
to
habit
himself
in
his
ordinary
attire
;
and
upon
the
wide
court
-
yard
,
across
which
Nicholas
be

in
the
direction
of
the

.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
excess
overnight
,
the
squire
be
astir
,
as
he
have
declare
he
should
be
,
before
daybreak
;
and
a
plunge
into
the
Calder
have
cool
his
feverish
limb
and
cure
his
rack
headache
,
while
a
draught
of
ale
set
his
stomach
right
.
<EOS>
still
,
in
modern
parlance
,
he
look
rather
"
seedy
,
"
and
his
recollection
of
the
event
of
the
previous
night
be
somewhat
confused
.
<EOS>
Aware
he
have
commit
many
foolery
,
he
do
not
desire
to
investigate
matter
too
closely
,
and
only
hope
he
should
not
be
remind
of
them

Sir
Ralph

or
bad
still
,
by
Parson
Dewhurst

<EOS>
as
to
his
poor

dear

uncomplaine
wife

he
never
once
trouble
his
head
about
her
,
feel
quite
sure
she
would
not
upbraid
him

<EOS>
on
his
appearance
in

,
the
two
noble

and
several
less

<EOS>
half
an
hour
on

I

perambulate
the

<EOS>
Flint

the
wicked

most
wilful

<EOS>
We
shall
have
Master

run
away
with
,
or
throw
into
a
moss

pit
.
<EOS>
better
give
him
something
quieter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It

Sir

"
reply
Peter
,
"
<EOS>
an
ey
darna

<EOS>
Boh

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
think
nothing
of
the
sort
,
Peter
,
"
say
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
You
expect
to
see
the
little
gentleman
fly
over
the
pony
's
head
,
and
perhaps
break
his
own
at
starting
.
<EOS>
but
if
Sir
Ralph
have
order
it
,
he
must
abide
by
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
sha'n't
interfere
further
.
<EOS>
how
go
on
the
young
colt
you
be
break
in
?
<EOS>
You
should
take
care
to
show
him
the
saddle
in
the
manger
,
let
him
smell
it
,
and
jingle
the
stirrup
in
his
ear
,
before
you
put
it
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
well
ground
for
his
first
lesson
could
not
be
desire
than
the
field
below
the
grange
,
near
the
Calder
.
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
be
say
yesterday
,
that
the
roan
mare
have
prick
her
foot
.
<EOS>
You
must
wash
the
sore
well
with
white
wine
and
salt
,
rub
it
with
the
ointment
the
farrier
call
ægyptiacum
,
and
then
put
upon
it
a
hot
plaster
compound
of
flax
hard
,
turpentine
,
oil
and
wax
,
bathe
the
top
of
the
hoof
with
bole
armeniac
and
vinegar
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
good
and
quick
remedy
.
<EOS>
and
recollect
,
Peter
,
that
for
a
new
strain
,
vinegar
,
bole
armeniac
,
white
of
egg
,
and
bean
-
flour
,
make
the
good
salve
.
<EOS>
how
go
on
Sir
Ralph
's
black
charger
,
Dragon
?
<EOS>
a
brave
horse
that
,
Peter
,
and
the
only
one
in
your
master
's
whole
stud
to
compare
with
my
Robin
!
<EOS>
but
Dragon
,
though
of
high
courage
and
great
swiftness
,
have
not
the
strength
and
endurance
of
Robin
--
neither
can
he
leap
so
well
.
<EOS>
why
,
Robin
would
almost
clear
the
Calder
,
Peter
,
and
make
nothing
of
Smithies
Brook
,
near
Downham
,
and
you
know
how
wide
that
stream
be
.
<EOS>
I
once
try
him
at
the
Ribble
,
at
a
narrow
point
,
and
if
horse
could
have
do
it
,
he
would
--
<EOS>
but
it
be
too
much
to
expect
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
great
deal
,
ey
should
say

reply
the

his

chestnut

black

but
dun
be
my
fancy

<EOS>
a

no

me

the
chance

he
will
not
support
my

I
must
put
on
an
air
of
penitence

sooth
to
say
,
in
my

state

it
be
not

difficult
to
assume

with

lengthen

approach
the

<EOS>
think
it
the
good
plan
to
open

fire
himself

Nicholas
salute
them

beautiful

for

I
have
be
awake

allowance

high
animal
spirit

can
excuse
some
licence

I

not

decorum

neither

me
more
strongly

I

<EOS>
I
allow
myself
to
be
overcome
by

in

guilty

folly
I

ever
regret

Nicholas

with
difficulty
repress
a
smile

as
I
certainly
lose
my
head

I
may
have
stand
upon
it
unconsciously

I
do
recollect
enough
to

heartily
ashamed

in

rejoin
Dewhurst

"
the
occurrence
of
last
night
,
though
sufficiently
discreditable
to
you

will
not
be
without
profit
;
for
I
have
observe
to
my
infinite
regret
,
that
you
be
apt
to
indulge
in
immoderate
potation
,
and
when
under
their
influence
to
lose
due
command

yourself

commit
folly

your

condemn

at
such
time
I

You
speak

levity

escape
your

<EOS>

It
be

true

Nicholas

zounds!--a
plague
upon

tongue

it
be
an
unruly

I
be
sober
enough
now

Nicholas
;

I
be
convinced

that
you
be
under

a
senseless

more
than
I

I

plainly

Nicholas

warmly
;

that
I

upon

I
will
not
take
upon

indeed
I

some
misgiving
on

Nicholas

,
as
I
have
already
pass
two

three
hour
in
prayer
<EOS>
,
I
hope
they
may
stand
me
in
lieu
of
any
present
fasting

and
induce
you
to
omit
the
article
of
penance
,
or
postpone
it
to
some
future
occasion

when
I
may
be
better
able

perform
it

for
I
be
just
now
particularly
hungry

always
better
able

resist
temptation

a
full
stomach

an
empty
one

as
I
find
it
displease
to
Sir

I
will
not

upon
my
visionary
partner

the
dance

at

until
I
be
better
able

substantiate
the
fact
;

I
shall
listen
to
your
lecture

worthy

with
great
delight

,
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
,
with
equal
benefit
;

in
the
meantime

as
carnal
want
must
be
supply
,

mundane
matter

,
I
propose

with
our
excellent
host

that
we
proceed
to
breakfast

<EOS>
Sir

make
no
answer

ascend
the
step
,
and
be
follow
by
Dewhurst
,
heave
a
deep
sigh
,
and
turn
up
the
white
of
his
eye

and
by
Nicholas

who
feel
his
bosom
ease
of
half
its
load
,
and
secretly
congratulate
himself
upon
get
out
of
the
scrape
so
easily

<EOS>
in
the
hall
they
find
Richard
Assheton
habit
in
a
riding
-
dress
,
boot
,
spur
,
and
in
all
respect
prepare
for
the
expedition
.
<EOS>
there
be
such
evident
trace
of
anxiety
and
suffer
about
him
,
that
Sir
Ralph
question
him
as
to
the
cause
,
and
Richard
reply
that
he
have
pass
a
most
restless
night
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
add
,
that
he
have
be
make
acquaint
by
Adam
Whitworth
with
the
midnight
visit
of
the
two
girl
to
the
conventual
church
,
because
he
be
well
aware
Sir
Ralph
would
be
greatly
displease
by
the
circumstance
,
and
because
Mistress
Nutter
have
express
a
wish
that
it
should
be
keep
secret
.
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
,
however
,
see
there
be
more
upon
his
young
relative
's
mind
than
he
choose
to
confess
,
but
he
do
not
urge
any
further
admission
into

<EOS>
meantime
,
the
party
have
be
increase
by
the
arrival
of
Master
Potts

who
be
likewise
equip
for
the
ride

<EOS>
the
hour
be
too
early
,
it
may
be
,
for
him
,
or
he
have
not
rest
well
like
Richard
,
or
have
be
trouble
with
bad
dream
,
but
certainly
he
do
not
look
very
well
,
or
in
very
good

humour
.
<EOS>
He
have
sleep
at
the
Abbey
,
have
be
accommodate
with
a
bed
after
the
sudden
seizure
which
he
attribute
to
the
instrumentality
of
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
the
little
attorney
bow
obsequiously
to
Sir
Ralph
,
who
return
his
salutation
very
stiffly
,
nor
be
he
much
better
receive
by
the
rest
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
at
a
sign
from
Sir
Ralph
,
his
guest
then
knelt
down
,
and
a
prayer
be
utter
by
the
divine
--
or
rather
a
discourse
,
for
it
partake
more
of
the
latter
character
than
the
former
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
it
he
take
occasion
to
paint
in
strong
colour
the
terrible
consequence
of
intemperance
,
and
Nicholas
be
oblige
to
endure
a
well
-
merit
lecture
of
half
an
hour
's
duration
.
<EOS>
but
even
Parson
Dewhurst
could
not
hold
out
for
ever
,
and
,
to
the
relief
of
all
his
hearer
,
he
at
length
bring
this
discourse
to
a
close
.
 
<EOS>
Breakfast
at
this
period
be
a
much
more
substantial
affair
than
a
modern
morning
repast
,
and
differ
little
from
dinner
or
supper
,
except
in
respect
to
quantity
.
<EOS>
on
the
present
occasion
,
there
be
carbonado
of
fish
and
fowl
,
a
cold
chine
,
a
huge
pasty
,
a
capon
,
neat
's
tongue
,
sausage
,
botargo
,
and
other
matter
as
provocative
of
thirst
as
suffice
to
the
appetite
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
set
to
work
bravely
.
<EOS>
broil
trout
,
steak
,
and
a
huge
slice
of
venison
pasty
,
disappear
quickly
before
him
,
and
he
be
not
quite
so
spare
of
the
ale
as
seem
consistent
with
his
previously
-
express
resolution
of
temperance
.
<EOS>
in
vain
Parson
Dewhurst
fill
a
goblet
with
water
,
and
look
significantly
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
take
the
hint
,
and
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
admonitory
cough
of
Sir
Ralph
.
<EOS>
He
have
little
help
from
the
other
,
for
Richard
eat
sparingly
,
and
Master
Potts
make
a
very
poor
figure
beside
him
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
have
clear
his
plate
,
empty
his
cup
,
and
wipe
his
lip
,
the
squire
arise
,
and
say
he
must
bid
adieu
to
his
wife
,
and
should
then
be
ready
to
attend
them
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
quit
the
hall
for
this
purpose
,
Mistress
Nutter
enter
it
.
<EOS>
She
look
paler
than
ever
,
and
her
eye
seem
large
,
dark
,
and
bright
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
shudder
slightly
as
she
approach
,
and
even
Potts
feel
a
thrill
of
apprehension
pass
through
his
frame
.
<EOS>
He
scarcely
,
indeed
,
venture
a
look
at
her
,
for
he
dread
her
mysterious
power
,
and
fear
she
could
fathom
the
design
he
secretly
entertain
against
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
take
no
notice
whatever
of
him
.
<EOS>
acknowledge
Sir
Ralph
's
salutation
,
she
motion
Richard
to
follow
her
to
the
further
end
of
the
room

<EOS>
Adam
Whitworth
have
tell
you

the
ruin

be
highly
prejudicial
,
if

fatal
to

<EOS>
It
be
most
unlucky

<EOS>
descend
to
the

hall

where

find
Sir

shout
of
laughter
salute
the
ear
of
the
trio
as
they
descend
the
step
.
<EOS>
the
cause
of
the
merriment
be
speedily
explain
when
they
look
towards
the
stable
,
and
beheld
Potts
struggle
for
mastery
with
a
stout
Welsh
pony
,
who
show
every
disposition
,
by
plunge
,
kick
,
and
rear
,
to
remove
him
from
his
seat
,
though
without
success
,
for
the
attorney
be
not
quite
such
a
contemptible
horseman
as
may
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
a
wicked
-
look
little
fellow
be
Flint
,
with
a
rough
,
rusty
-
black
coat
,
a
thick
tail
that
sweep
the
ground
,
a
mane
to
match
,
and
an
eye
of
mixed
fire
and
cunning
.
<EOS>
when
bring
forth
he
have
allow
Potts
to
mount
him
quietly
enough
;
but
no
sooner
be
the
attorney
comfortably
in
possession
,
than
he
be
serve
with
a
notice
of
ejectment
.
<EOS>
down
go
Flint
's
head
and
up
go
his
heel
;
while
on
the
next
instant
he
be
rear
aloft
,
with
his
fore

foot
beat
the
air
,
so
nearly
perpendicular
,
that
the
chance
seem
in
favour
of
his
come
down
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
then
he
whirl
suddenly
round
,
shake
himself
violently
,
threaten
to
roll
over
,
and
perform
antic
of
the
most
extraordinary
kind
,
to
the
dismay
of
his
rider
,
but
to
the
infinite
amusement
of
the
spectator

who
be
ready
to
split
their
side
with
laughter
--
indeed
,
tear
fairly
stream
down
the
squire
's
cheek
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
Sir
Ralph
appear
,
it
be
think
desirable
to
put
an
end
to
the
fun
;
and
Peter
,
the
groom
,
advance
to
seize
the
restive
little
animal
's
bridle
,
but
,
elude
the
grasp
,
Flint
start
off
at
full
gallop
,
and
,
accompany
by
the
two
blood

hound
,
career
round
the
court

yard

as
if
run
in

vainly
do
poor

tug
at
the
bridle

<EOS>
Flint
,
have
the
bit
firmly
between

defy
his

away

the
hound
at

as
if

say
Nicholas
,
"
the
devil
be
behind
him

"
<EOS>
though
annoyed
and
angry
,
Sir
Ralph
could
not
help
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
scene
,
and
even
a
smile
cross
Parson
Dewhurst
's
grave
countenance
as
Flint
and
his
rider
scamper
madly
past
them
.
<EOS>
Sir
Ralph
call
to
the
groom
,
and
attempt
be
instantly
make
to
check
the
furious
pony
's
career
;
but
he
baffle
them
all
,
swerve
suddenly
round
when
an
endeavour
be
make
to
intercept
him
,
leap
over
any
trifling
obstacle
,
and
occasionally
charge
any
one
who
stand
in
his
path
.
<EOS>
what
with
the
groom
run
hither
and
thither
,
vociferating
and
swearing
,
the
barking
and
springing
of
the
hound
,
the
yelping
of
less
dog
,
and
the
screaming
of
poultry
,
the
whole
yard
be
in
a
state
of
uproar
and
confusion
.

<EOS>
this
occur
sooner
than

<EOS>

possibly
,
that
he
have
do
enough
to
induce
Master
Potts
to
give
up
all
idea
of
ride
him
,
Flint
suddenly
slacken
his
pace
,
and
trot
,
as
if
nothing
have
happen
,
to
the
stable

door
;
but
if
he
have
form
any
such
notion
as
the
above
,
he
be
deceive
,
for
the
attorney
,
who
be
quite
as
obstinate

wilful
as
himself

and
who
through
all
his
peril
have
manage
to
maintain
his

,
be
resolve
not
to
abandon
it
,
and
positively
refuse
to
dismount
when
urge
to
do
so
by
Nicholas

the
groom

<EOS>
"
He
will
go
quietly
enough
now
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say

"
observe
Potts
,
"
and
if
not
,
and
you
will
lend
me
a
hunting

whip

I
will
undertake
to

of
his
trick

"
 
<EOS>
Flint
seem
to
understand
what
be
say
,
for
he
lay
back
his
ear
as
if
meditate
more
mischief
;
but
be
surround
by
the
groom
,
he
deem
it
advisable
to
postpone
the
attempt
to
a
more
convenient
opportunity

<EOS>
in
compliance
with
his
request
,
a
heavy
hunting

and

with

Sir

at

<EOS>
at

want
grandeur

they
themselves

shortly
after

by
a
brook
,
and
both

clear
it
excellently
,
they
keep
well
together
again
for
a
short
time
,
when
they
near
a

which
lie
between

and
the

out
a
course
to
the

but
Nicholas

on
,
unheede
the
caution
.
<EOS>
fully
expect
to
see
him
break
his
neck
,
for
the
dyke
be
of
formidable
width
,
Richard
watch
him
with
apprehension
,
but
the
squire
give
him
a
re
-
assuring
nod
,
and
go
on
.
<EOS>
neither
horse
nor
man
falter
,
though
failure
would
have
be
certain
destruction
to
both

<EOS>
the
wide

now
yawn
before
them
--
they
be
upon
its
edge
,
and
without
trust
himself
to
measure
it
with
his
eye
,
Nicholas
clap
spur
into
Robin
's
side
.
<EOS>
the
brave
horse
spring
forward
and
land
him
safely
on
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
halloo
cheerily
,
as
soon
as
he
could
check
his
courser
the
squire
wheel
round
,
and
ride
back
to
look
at
the
dyke
he
have
cross
.
<EOS>
Its
width
be
terrific
,
and
fairly
astound
him
.
<EOS>
Robin
snort
loudly
,
as
if
proud
of
his
achievement
,
and
show
some
disposition
to
return
,
but
the
squire
be
quite
content
with
what
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
the
exploit
afterwards
become
a
theme
of
wonder
throughout
the
country
,
and
the
spot
be
long
afterwards
point
out
as
"
Squire
Nicholas

Leap
"
;
but
there
be
not
another
horseman

enough
to
repeat
the
experiment

<EOS>
Richard

to
make
a
considerable
circuit
to
join
his
cousin
,
and
,
while
he
be
go
round
,
Nicholas
look
out
for
the
other
.
<EOS>
in
the
distance
,
he
could
see
Roger
Nowell
ride
leisurely
on
,
follow
by
Sparshot
and
a
couple
of
groom
,
who
have
come
with
their
master
from
the
hall
;
while
midway
,
to
his
surprise
,
he
perceive
Flint
gallop
without
a
rider
.
<EOS>
a
close
examination
show
the

<EOS>

Master

out
of

cover
from

with
inky

coloured
slime
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
aware
of
the
accident
,
the
two
groom
push
forward
,
and
one
of
them
gallop
after
Flint
,
whom
he
succeed
at
last
in
catching
;
while
the
other
,
with
difficulty
preserve
his
countenance
at
the
woful
plight
of
the
attorney

who
look
as
black
as

point
out
a
cottage
in
the
hollow
which
belong
to
one
of
the
keeper
,
and
offer
to
conduct
him
thither
.
<EOS>
Potts
gladly
assent
,
and
soon

the
little
tenement
,
where
he
be
be
wash
and
rub
down
by
a
couple
of
stout
wench
when
the
rest
of
the
party
come
up
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
help
laugh
at
him
,
but
Potts
take
the
merriment
in
good
part
;
and
,
to
show
he
be
not
dishearten
by
the
misadventure
,
as

CHAPTER
III.--THE
BOGGART
's
GLEN
.
  
<EOS>
the
manor
of
Read
,
it
have
be
say
,
be
skirt
by
a
deep
woody
ravine
of
three
or
four
mile
in
length
,
extend
from
the
little
village
of
Sabden
,
in
Pendle
Forest
,
to
within
a
short
distance
of
Whalley
;
and
through
this
gully
flow
a
stream
which
,
take
its
rise
near
Barley
,
at
the
foot
of
Pendle
Hill
,
add
its
water
to
those
of
the
Calder
at
a
place
call
Cock
Bridge
.
<EOS>
in
summer
,
or
in
dry
season
,
this
stream
proceed
quietly
enough
,
and
leave
the
great
part
of
its
stony
bed
unoccupied
;
but
in
winter
,
or
after
continuous
rain
,
it
assume
all
the
character
of
a
mountain
torrent
,
and
sweep
every
thing
before
it
.
<EOS>
a
narrow
bridle
road
lead
through
the
ravine
to
Sabden
,
and
along

,
the
cavalcade

<EOS>
the
little
river
dance
merrily
past
them
,
singe
as
it
go
,
the
sunshine
sparkle
on
its
bright
clear
water
,
and
glitter
on
the
pebble
beneath
them
.
<EOS>
now
the
stream
would
chafe
and
foam
against
some
large
impediment
to
its
course
;
now
it
would
dash
down
some
rocky
height
,
and
form
a
beautiful
cascade
;
then
it
would
hurry
on
for
some
time
with
little
interruption
,
till
stay
by
a
projecting
bank
it
would
form
a
small
deep
basin
,
where
,
beneath
the
far
-
cast
shadow
of
an
overhanging
oak
,
or
under
its
huge
twist
and
denuded
root
,
the
angler
may
be
sure
of
find
the
speckle
trout
,
the
dainty
greyling
,
or
their
mutual
enemy
,
the
voracious
jack
.
<EOS>
the
ravine
be
well
wooded
throughout
,
and
in
many
part
singularly
beautiful
,
from
the
disposition
of
the
timber
on
its
bank
,
as
well
as
from
the
varied
form
and
character
of
the
tree
.
<EOS>
here
may
be
see
an
acclivity
cover
with
wave
birch
,
or
a
top
crown
with
a
mountain
ash
--
there
,
on
a
smooth
expanse
of
greensward
,
stand
a
range
of
noble
elm
,
whose
mighty
arm
stretch
completely
across
the
ravine
.
<EOS>
further
on
,
there
be
chestnut
and
walnut
tree
;
willow
,
with
hoary
stem
and
silver

almost
encroach
upon
the
stream
;
larche
upon
the
height
;
and
here
and
there
,
upon
some
sandy
eminence
,
a
spread
beech
-
tree
.
<EOS>
for
the
most
part
the
bottom
of
the
glen
be
overgrow
with
brushwood
,
and
,
where
its
side
be
too
abrupt
to
admit
the
growth
of
large
tree
,
they
be
mat
with
woodbine
and
bramble
.
<EOS>
out
of
these
would
sometimes
start
a
sharp
pinnacle
,
or
fantastically
-
form
crag
,
add
greatly
to
the
picturesque
beauty
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
on
such
point
be
not
unfrequently
find
perch
a
hawk
,
a
falcon
,
or
some
large
bird
of
prey
;
for
the
gully
,
with
its
brake
and
thicket
,
be
a
favourite
haunt
of
the
feather
tribe
.
<EOS>
the
holly
,
of
which
there
be
plenty
,
with
their
green
prickly

the
thorn

by
the
thrush
;
and
numberless
less
songster
fill
every
other
tree
.
<EOS>
in
the
covert
there
be
pheasant
and
partridge
in
abundance
,
and
snipe
and
wild
-
fowl

to
the
river
in
winter
.
<EOS>
thither
also
,
at
all
season
,
repair
the
stately

,
to
devour
the
finny
race
;
and
thither

on

,
the

<EOS>
the

,
the

Hitherto

the
glen
have
be
remarkable
for
its
softness
and
beauty

but
it

to

a
savage

sombre
character

<EOS>
the

precipitous
;
while
the

meet
overhead

intermingle
their

form
a

impervious
to

<EOS>
the

be
likewise

and
its
current

which

,
look
black
as

flow
swiftly

as

<EOS>
a
large
raven
,
which
have
attend
the
horseman
all
the
way
,
now
alight
near

,
and
croak
ominously
.
 
<EOS>
this
part
of
the
glen
be
in
very
ill
repute
,
and
be
never
traverse
,
even
at
noonday
,
without
apprehension
.
<EOS>
Its
wild
and
savage
aspect
,
its
horrent
precipice
,
its
shaggy
wood
,
its
strangely

shape
rock
and
tenebrous
depth
,
where
every
imperfectly

see
object
appear
doubly
frightful
--
all
combine
to
invest
it
with
mystery
and
terror
.
<EOS>
no
one
willingly
linger
here
,
but
hurry
on
,
afraid
of
the
sound
of
his
own
footstep
.
<EOS>
no
one
dare
to
gaze
at
the
rock
,
lest
he
should
see
some
hideous
hobgoblin
peer
out
of
their
fissure
.
<EOS>
no
one
glance
at
the
water
,
for
fear
some
terrible
kelpy
,
with
twine
snake
for
hair
and
scaly
hide
,
should
issue
from
it
and
drag
him
down
to
devour
him
with
his
shark
-
like
tooth

<EOS>
among
the
common
folk
,
this
part
of
the
ravine
be
know
as
"
the
boggart
's
glen
"
,
and
be
suppose
to
be
haunt
by
mischievous
being
,
who
make
the
unfortunate
wanderer
their
sport
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
last
half
-
mile
the
road
have
be
so
narrow
and
intricate
in
its
winding
,
that
the
party
be
oblige
to
proceed
singly
;
but
this
do
not
prevent
conversation
;
and
Nicholas
,
throw
the
bridle
over
Robin
's
neck
,
leave
the
surefoote
animal
to
pursue
his
course
unguided
,
while
he
himself
,
lean
back
,
chat
with
Roger
Nowell
.
<EOS>
at
the
entrance
of
the
gloomy
gorge
above
describe
,
Robin
come
to
a
stand
,
and
refuse
to
move
at
a
jerk
from
his
master
,
the
latter
raise
himself
,
and
look
forward
to
see
what
could
be
the
cause
of
the
stoppage
.
<EOS>
no
impediment
be
visible
,
but
the
animal
obstinately
refuse
to
go
on
,
though
urge
both
by
word
and
spur
.
<EOS>
this
stoppage
necessarily
delay
the
rest
of
the
cavalcade
.
 
<EOS>
well
aware
of
the
ill
reputation
of
the
place
,
when
Simon
Sparshot
and
the
groom
find
that
Robin
would
not
go
on
,
they
declare
he
must
see
the
boggart
,
and
urge
the
squire
to
turn
back
,
or
some
mischief
would
befall
him
.
<EOS>
but
Nicholas
,
though
not
without
misgiving
,
do
not
like
to
yield
thus
,
especially
when
urge
on
by
Roger
Nowell
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
party
could
not
get
out
of
the
ravine
without
go
back
nearly
a
mile
,
while
Sabden
be
only
half
that
distance
from
them
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
?
<EOS>
Robin
still
continue
obstinate
,
and
for
the
first
time
pay
no
attention
to
his
master
's
command
.
<EOS>
the
poor
animal
be
evidently
a
prey
to
violent
terror
,
and
snort
and
rear

while
his
limb
be
bathe
in
cold
sweat

<EOS>
dismounting
,
and
leave
him
in
charge
of
Roger
Nowell
,
Nicholas
walk
on
by
himself
to
see
if
he
could
discover
any
cause
for
the
horse
's
alarm
;
and
he
have
not
advance
far
,
when
his
eye
rest
upon
a
blast
oak
form
a
conspicuous

on
a

on

Would
I
have
a

"
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
pick
up
a
stone
to
cast
at
the
raven
,
a
crash
noise
be
hear
among
the
bush
high
up
on
the
rock

and
the
next
moment
a
huge
fragment
dislodge

Nicholas

with
the
cry
of
the
bird

<EOS>
the
raven
nod
its
head
and
expand
its
wing
,
and
the
squire
,
whose
recent
experience
have
prepare
him
for
any
wonder
,
fully
expect
to
hear
it
speak
,
but
it
only
croak
loudly
and
exultingly
,
or
if
it
laugh
,
the
sound
be
like
the
creaking
of
rusty
hinge
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
do
not
like
it
at
all
,
and
he
resolve
to
go
back
;
but
ere
he
could
do
so
,
he
be
startle
by
a
buffet
on
the
ear
,
and
turn
angrily
round
to
see
who
have
deal
it
<EOS>
,
he
could
distinguish
no
one
,
but
at
the
same
moment
receive
a
second
buffet
on
the
other
ear
.
 
<EOS>
the
raven
croak
merrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
I
could
wring
thy
neck
,
accurse
bird

"
<EOS>
cry
the
enraged
squire
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely

vindictive
wish
utter
than
a
shower
of
blow
fall
upon
him
,
and
kick
from
unseen
foot
be
apply
to
his
person

<EOS>
all
the
while
the
raven
croak
merrily
,
and
flap
his
big
black
wing
.
 
<EOS>
infuriate
by
the
attack
,
the
squire
hit
right
and
leave
manfully
,
and
dash
out
his
foot
in
every
direction
;
but
his
blow
and
kick
only
meet
the
empty
air
,
while
those
of
his
unseen
antagonist
tell
upon
his
own
person
with
increase
effect
.
 
<EOS>
the
spectacle
seem
to
afford
infinite
amusement
to
the
raven
.
<EOS>
the
mischievous
bird
almost
crow
with
glee
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
standing
it
any
longer
.
<EOS>
so
,
amid
a
perfect
hurricane
of
blow
and
kick
,
and
with
the
infernal
voice
of
the
raven
ringing
in
his
ear
,
the
squire
take
to
his
heel
.
<EOS>
on
reach
his
companion
he
find
they
have
not
fare
much
well
than
himself
.
<EOS>
the
two
groom
be
belabour
each
other
lustily
;
and
Master
Potts
be
exercise
his
hunting
-
whip
on
the
broad
shoulder
of
Sparshot

who
in
return

make
him
acquaint

the
taste
of
a
stout
ash
-
plant
.
<EOS>
assail
in
the
same
manner
as
the
squire
,
and
naturally
attribute
the
attack
to
their
near
neighbour
,
they
wait
for
no
explanation
,
but
fall
upon
each
other
.
<EOS>
Richard
Assheton
and
Roger
Nowell
endeavour
to
interfere
and
separate
the
combatant
,
and
in
do
so
receive
some
hard
knock
for
their
pain
;
but
all
their
pacific
effort
be
fruitless
,
until
the
squire
appear
,
and
tell
them
they
be
merely
the
sport
of
hobgoblin
<EOS>
,
they
desist
,
but
still
the
blow
fall
heavily
on
them
as
before

prove
the
truth

assertion

<EOS>
meanwhile
the

mount
Robin

exhibit
the
same
reluctance
to
proceed

he
dash
at
full
speed
through
the

glen

but
even
above
the
clatter
,
of
hoofs
,
and
the
noise

exulting
croaking
of

as
the

and
the
sun
once
more

its

through

and
shine
upon

begin
to

it

not

fairly
out
of
the
wood
that
he
relax
his
speed
.
<EOS>
not
care
to
enter
into
any
explanation
of
the
occurrence
,
he
ride
a
little
apart
to
avoid
conversation
;
as
the

,
who
be
still
smart
from
the
blow
they
have
receive
,
be
in
no
very
good
-
humour
,
a
sullen
silence
prevail
throughout
the

they
mount
the
bare
hill

side
in
the
direction
of
the
few

the
village
of
Sabden

<EOS>
a
blight
seem
to
have
fall
upon
the
place
.
<EOS>
Roger
Nowell
,
who
have
visit
it
a
few
month
ago
,
could
scarcely
believe
his
eye
,
so
changed
be
its
appearance
.
<EOS>
His
inquiry
as
to
the
cause
of
its
altered
condition
be
every
where
meet
by
the
same
answer
--
the
poor
people
be
all
bewitch
.
<EOS>
here
a
child
be
ill
of
a
strange
sickness
,
toss
and
tumble
in
its
bed
,
and
contort
its
limb
so
violently
,
that
its
parent
could
scarcely
hold
it
down
.
<EOS>
another
family
be
afflict
in
a
different
manner
,
two
of
its
number
pine
away
and
lose
strength
daily
,
as
if
a
prey
to
some
consume
disease
.
<EOS>
in
a
third
,
another
child
be
sick
,
and
vomit
pin
,
nail
,
and
other
extraordinary
substance
.
<EOS>
a
fourth
household
be
torment
by
an
imp
in
the
form
of
a
monkey
,
who
come
at
night
and
pinch
them
all
black
and
blue
,
spill
the
milk
,
break
the
dish
and
platter
,
get
under
the
bed
,
and
,
raise
it
to
the
roof
,
let
it
fall
with
a
terrible
crash
;
put
them
all
in
mental
terror
.
<EOS>
in
the
next
cottage
there
be
no
end
to
calamity
,
though
they
take
a
more
absurd
form
.
<EOS>
sometimes
the
fire
would
not
burn
,
or
when
it
do
it
emit
no
heat
,
so
that
the
pot
would
not
boil
,
nor
the
meat
roast
.
<EOS>
then
the
oatcake
would
stick
to
the
bake
-
stone
,
and
no
force
could
get
them
away
from
it
till
they
be
burn
and
spoil
;
the
milk
turn
sour
,
the
cheese
become
so
hard
that
not
even
rat
'
tooth
could
gnaw
it
,
the
stool
and
settle
break
down
if
sit
upon
,
and
the
list
of
petty
grievance
be
complete
by
a
whole
side
of
bacon
be
devour
in
a
single
night
.
<EOS>
Roger
Nowell
and
Nicholas
listen
patiently
to
a
detail
of
all
these
grievance
,
and
express
strong
sympathy
for
the
sufferer
,
promise
assistance
and
redress
if
possible
.
<EOS>
all
the
complainant
tax
either
Mother
Demdike
or
Mother
Chattox

afflict
them

and
say
they
have
incur
the

of
the

malevolent

refuse
to

them
with
poultry
,
egg

<EOS>
Master

make
ample
note
of
the
strange

and
take
down
the

<EOS>
at
length
,
they
arrive
at

here
a

with

soon
after

they
enter
a
wide
dreary
waste
form
the
bottom
of
the
valley
,
lie
between
the
height
of
Padiham
and
Pendle
Hill
,
and
while
wend
their
way
across
it
,
they
hear
a
shout
from
the
hill
-
side
,
and
presently
afterwards
perceive
a
man
,
mount
on
a
powerful
black
horse
,
gallop
swiftly
towards
them
.
<EOS>
the
party
await
his
approach

stranger
speedily
come
up

<EOS>
He
be
a
small
man
habit
in
a
suit
of
rusty
black
,
and
bear
a
most
extraordinary
and
marked
resemblance
to
Master
Potts

<EOS>
He
have
the
same
perky
feature
,
the
same
parchment
complexion
,
the
same
yellow
forehead
,
as
the
little
attorney
.
<EOS>
so
surprising
be
the
likeness
,
that
Nicholas
unconsciously
look
round
for
Potts
,
and
beheld
him
stare
at

new

comer
in
angry
wonder

surprise

party

by
no
means

when
the
stranger
speak
.
<EOS>
His
voice
exactly
resemble
the
sharp
crack
tone
of
the
attorney

<EOS>
"

freedom

and
salute
them
respectfully

"
<EOS>
but
,
be
aware
of
your
errand
,
I
be
come
to

"
 
<EOS>
"
and
who

fellow

who
thus
volunteer
your
service
?
"
demand
Roger
Nowell
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
one
of
the
reeve
of
the
forest
of
Blackburnshire
,
worshipful
sir
,
"
reply
the
stranger
,
"
and
as
such

property

"
 
<EOS>

exclaim
Nowell

"
 
<EOS>
"
Mistress
Nutter
send
me
word
last
night
,
"
reply
the
reeve
,
"
that
Master
Nicholas
Assheton
and
certain
other
gentleman
,
would
come
to
Rough
Lee
for
the
purpose
of
ascertain
the
mark
,
mere
,
and
boundary
of
her
property
,
early
this
morning
,
and
desire
my
attendance
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
accordingly
I
station
myself
on
yon
high
ground
to
look
out
for
you
,
and
have
be
on
the
watch

more
than
an
hour

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Humph

"
exclaim
Roger
Nowell
,
"
and

the
forest

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
live
at
Barrowford

worshipful

the
reeve
,
"

I

only
lately

may

Nowell

"
You

"
 
<EOS>
"
aha

<EOS>

"
cry
Nowell
;
"
you

suborn
to

false
testimony

<EOS>
I
object
to
his
attendance

Master
Nicholas

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nay

I
think
you

the

injustice

"
say
the
squire
.
"
<EOS>
He
speak
frankly
and
fairly
enough
,
and
seem
to
know
his
business
.
<EOS>
the
bad
that
can
be
say
against
him
be
,
that
he
resemble
somewhat
too
closely
our
little
legal
friend
there
.
<EOS>
that
,
however
,
ought
to
be
no
objection

you

Master
Nowell

rather
the
contrary
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
take
the
responsibility
of
the
matter
upon
your
own
shoulder
,
"

Nowell

any
ill
come
of
it
I
shall
blame
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
so

reply
the
squire
;
"
my

broad
enough

the
burthen

<EOS>
You

"
 
<EOS>
"
May

exclaim
Nicholas

who

I

You

judge

the

anxious

apparently
,
to
avoid

conversation

he
draw
in
the
rein

allow

to
pass
on

<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
boasting

Master

much
secret
misgiving

his

obstinacy
make
him
determine

comfort
himself
by
recall
the

<EOS>
as

pass
through
the

mind
a
low
derisive
laugh
sound
in

connect
it
with

he
look
back

find
the

maliciously

the

effect

rather

be

the

vindictive

Booth
--
for
so
the
little
hostel
at
Goldshaw
be
call
,
after
its
mistress
Bess
Whitaker
--
be
far
more
comfortable
and
commodious
than
its
unpretende
exterior
seem
to
warrant
.
<EOS>
stouter
and
bright
ale
be
not
to
be
drunk
in
Lancashire
than
Bess
brew
;
nor
be
better
sherris
or
clary
to
be
find
,
go
where
you
would
,
than
in
her
cellar
.
<EOS>
the
traveller
cross
those
dreary
waste
,
and
ride
from
Burnley
to
Clithero
,
or
from
Colne
to
Whalley
,
as
the
case
may
be
,
may
well
halt
at
Bess
's
,
and
be
sure
of
a
roast
fowl
for
dinner
,
with
the
addition
,
perhaps
,
of
some
trout
from
Pendle
Water
,
or
,
if
the
season
permit
,
a
heath
-
cock
or
a
pheasant
;
or
,
if
he
tarry
there
for
the
night
,
he
be
equally
sure
of
a
good
supper
and
fair
linen
.
<EOS>
It
have
already
be
mention
,
that
at
this
period
it
be
the
custom
of
all
class
in
the
northern
county
,
man
and
woman
,
to
resort
to
the
alehouse
to
drink
,
and
the
hostel
at
Goldshaw
be
the
general
rendezvous
of
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
for
those
who
could
afford
it
Bess
would
brew
incomparable
sack
;
but
if
a
guest
call
for
wine
,
and
she
like
not
his
look
,
she
would
flatly
tell
him
her
ale
be
good
enough
for
him
,
and
if
it
please
him
not
he
should
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
submission
always
follow
in
such
case
,
for
there
be
no
disputing
with
Bess
.
<EOS>
neither
would
she
permit
the
frequenter
of
the
hostel
to
sit
later
than
she
choose
,
and
would
clear
the
house
in
a
way
equally
characteristic
and
effectual
.
<EOS>
at
a
certain
hour
,
and
that
by
no
mean
a
late
one
,
she
would
take
down
a
large
horsewhip
,
which
hang
on
a
convenient
peg
in
the
principal
room
,
and
after
bluntly
order
her
guest
to
go
home
,
if
any
resistance
be
offer
,
she
would
lay
the
whip
across
their
shoulder
,
and
forcibly
eject
them
from
the
premise
;
but
,
as
her
determined
character
be
well
know
,
this
violence
be
seldom
necessary
.
<EOS>
in
strength
Bess
be
a
match
for
any
man
,
and
assistance
from
her
cowherd
--
for
she
be
a
farmer
as
well
as
hostess
<EOS>
--
be
at
hand
if
require
.
<EOS>
as
will
be
surmise
from
the
above
,
Bess
be
large
and
masculine
-
look
,
but
well
-
proportion
nevertheless
,
and
possess
a
certain
coarse
kind
of
beauty
,
which
in
early
year
have
inflame
Richard
Baldwyn
,
the
miller
of
Rough
Lee
,
who
make
overture
of
marriage
to
her
.
<EOS>
these
be
favourably
entertain
,
but
a
slight
quarrel
occur
between
them
,
the
lover
,
in
her
own
phrase
,
get
"
his
jacket
soundly
dust
"
by
her
,
and
declare
off
,
take
to
wife
a
more
docile
and
light
-
handed
maiden
.
<EOS>
as
to
Bess
,
though
she
have
give
this
unmistakable
proof
of
her
ability
to
manage
a
husband
,
she
do
not
receive
a
second
offer
,
nor
,
as
she
have
now
attain
the
mature
age
of
forty
,
do
it
seem
likely
she
would
ever
receive
one
.
 
<EOS>

the
window

more
than
narrow
slit

with
heavy
stone
frame
,
further
darken
by
minute
diamond
pane
;
but
the
bench
be
scrupulously
clean
,
and
so
be
the
long
oak
table
in
the
centre
of
the
principal
and
only
large
room
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
a
roundabout
fireplace
occupy
one
end

from
the
draught
of
the
door
by
a
dark
oak
screen
,
with
a
bench
on
the
warm
side
of
it
;
and
here
,
or
in
the
deep
ingle
-
nook
,
on
winter
night
,
the
neighbour
would
sit
and
chat
by
the
blaze
hearth
,
discuss
pot
of
"
nappy
ale
,
good
and
stale
,
"
as
the
old
ballad
hath
it
;
and
as
person
of
both
sex
come
thither
,
young
as
well
as
old
,
many
a
match
be
strike
up
by
Bess
's
cheery
fireside
.
<EOS>
from
the
blacken
rafter
hang
a
goodly
supply
of
hams
,
side
of
bacon
,
and
dry
tongue
,
with
a
profusion
of
oatcake
in
a
bread
-
flake
;
while
,
in
case
this
store
should
be
exhaust
,
mean
of
replenishment
be
at
hand
in
the
huge
,
full
-
crammed
meal
-
chest
standing
in
one
corner
.
<EOS>
altogether
,
there
be
a
look
of
abundance
as
well
as
of
comfort
about
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Great
be
Bess
's
consternation
when
the
poor
pedlar
,
who
have
quit
her
house
little
more
than
an
hour
ago
,
full
of
health
and
spirit
,
be
bring
back
to
it
in
such
a
deplorable
condition
;
and
when
she
see
him
deposit
at
her
door
,
notwithstanding
her
masculine
character
,
she
have
some
difficulty
in
repress
a
scream
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
,
however
,
yield
to
the
weakness
,
but
see
at
once
what
be
good
to
be
do
,
cause
him
to
be
transport
by
the
groom
to
the
chamber
he
have
occupy
over
-
night
,
and
lay
upon
the
bed
.
<EOS>
medical
assistance
be
fortunately
at
hand
;
for
it
chance
that
Master
Sudall
,
the
chirurgeon
of
Colne
,
be
in
the
house
at
the
time
,
have
be
bring
to
Goldshaw
by
the
great
sickness
that
prevail
at
Sabden
and
elsewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Sudall
be
immediately
in
attendance
upon
the
sufferer
,
and
bleed
him
copiously
,
after
which
the
poor
man
seem
much
easy
;
and
Richard
Assheton
,
take
the
chirurgeon
aside
,
ask
his
opinion
of
the
case
,
and
be
tell
by
Sudall
that
he
do
not
think
the
pedlar
's
life
in
danger
,
but
he
doubt
whether
he
would
ever
recover
the
use
of
his
limb
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
attribute
the
attack
to
witchcraft
,
I
suppose
,
Master
Sudall
?
"
say
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
to
deliver
an
opinion
,
sir
,
"
reply
the
chirurgeon
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
decide
,
when
all
the
appearance
be
precisely
like
those
of
an
ordinary
attack
of
paralysis
.
<EOS>
but
a
sad
case
have
recently
come
under
my
observation
,
as
to
which
I
can
have
no
doubt
--
<EOS>
I
mean
as
to
its
be
the
result
of
witchcraft

but
I
will
tell
you
more

a
short

answer
your

Master
Richard
,
and
a
most
afflict
one
it
be
.
<EOS>
but
you
shall
have
the
particular
.
<EOS>
six
month
ago
,
Mary
Baldwyn
be
as
lovely
and
bloom
a
lass
as
could
be
see
,
the
joy
of
her
widowed
father
's
heart
.
<EOS>
a
hot
-
headed
,
obstinate
man
be
Richard
Baldwyn
,
and
he
be
unwise
enough
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
Mother
Demdike
,
by
favour
her
rival
,
old
Chattox
,
to
whom
he
give
flour
and
meal
,
while
he
refuse
the
same
tribute
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
the
first
time
Mother
Demdike
be
dismiss
without
the
customary
dole
,
one
of
his
millstone
break
,
and
,
instead
of
take
this
as
a
warning
,
he
become
more
obstinate
.
<EOS>
She
come
a
second
time
,
and
he
send
her
away
with
curse
.
<EOS>
then
all
his
flour
grow
damp
and
musty
,
and
no
one
would
buy
it
.
<EOS>
still
he
remain
obstinate
,
and
,
when
she
appear
again
,
he
would
have
lay
hand
upon
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
raise
her
staff
,
and
the
blow
fall
short
.
'
<EOS>
I
have
give
thee
two
warning
,
Richard
,
'
she
say
,
'
and
thou
hast
pay
no
heed
to
them
.
<EOS>
now
I
will
make
thee
smart
,
lad
,
in
right
earnest
.
<EOS>
that
which
thou
lovest
good
thou
shalt
lose
.
'
<EOS>
upon
this
,
bethink
him
that
the
dear
thing
he
have
in
the
world
be
his
daughter
Mary
,
and
afraid
of
harm
happen
to
her
,
Richard
would
fain
have
make
up
his
quarrel
with
the
old
witch
;
but
it
have
now
go
too
far
,
and
she
would
not
listen
to
him
,
but
utter
some
word
,
with
which
the
name
of
the
girl
be
mingle
,
shake
her
staff
at
the
house
and
depart
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
poor
Mary
be
take
ill
,
and
her
father
,
in
despair
,
apply
to
old
Chattox
,
who
promise
him
help
,
and
do
her
good
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
--
for
she
would
have
willingly
thwart
her
rival
,
and
rob
her
of
her
prey
;
but
the
latter
be
too
strong
for
her
,
and
the
hapless
victim
get
daily
bad
and
bad
.
<EOS>
Her
bloom
cheek
grow
white
and
hollow
,
her
dark
eye
glisten
with
unnatural
lustre
,
and
she
be
see
no
more
on
the
bank
of
Pendle
water
.
<EOS>
before
this
my
aid
have
be
call
in
by
the
afflict
father
--
and
I
do
all
I
could
--
but
I
know
she
would
die

and
I
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
the
information
I
fear
have
kill
him
,
for
he
fall
down
like
a
stone
--
and
I
repent
have
speak
.
<EOS>
however
he
recover
,
and
make
a
last
appeal
to
Mother
Demdike
;
but
the
unrelenting
hag
deride
him
and
curse
him
,
tell
him
if
he
bring
her
all
his
mill
contain
,
and
add
to
that
all
his
substance
,
she
would
not
spare
his
child

<EOS>
He
return

and
never

the
poor

bedside
till

after

It

have
meditate
some

assure
him
that
the
most
certain
and
efficacious
mode

he
could
adopt
would
be
through

that

while

who

<EOS>
so
overpower
by
grief

that
the

deem
it
expedient

may
indulge
his

unobserved

without

he
pause

<EOS>
the

continue

<EOS>
the
sad
tale

have
hear
hold
possession
of
his

while
he
pity
poor
Mary

he
begin
to
entertain
apprehension
that
Alizon
may
meet
a
similar
fate

<EOS>
so
many
strange
circumstance
have
take
place
during

by

which
it
be
impossible
to
shake
off

<EOS>
He
think
of
Mothers
Demdike

Chattox

<EOS>
Could
these
dread
being

permit
to
exercise
such
baneful
influence
over
mankind

<EOS>
with
all
the
apparent
proof
of
their
power
he
have
receive
,
he
still
strove
to
doubt
,
and
to
persuade
himself
that
the
various
case
of
witchcraft
describe
to
him
be
only
hold
to
be
such
by
the
timid
and
the
credulous
.
 
<EOS>
full
of
these
meditation
,
he
tie
his
horse
to
a
tree
and
enter
the
churchyard
,
and
while
pursue
a
path

by
a
row
of

lead
to

he

who
attract
his

<EOS>
one
be
the

who
be

an

neither

his

and

influence
by
an
unaccountable
feeling

he
stand

CHAPTER
VI.--THE
TEMPTATION
.
  
<EOS>
shortly
after
Richard
's
departure
,
a
round
,
rosy
-
faced
personage
,
whose
rusty
black
cassock
,
hastily
huddle
over
a
dark
riding
-
dress
,
proclaim
him
a
churchman
,
enter
the
hostel
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
rector
of
Goldshaw
,
Parson
Holden
,
a
very
worthy
little
man
,
though
rather
,
perhaps
,
too
fond
of
the
sport
of
the
field
and
the
bottle
.
<EOS>
to
Roger
Nowell
and
Nicholas
Assheton
<EOS>
he
be
of
course
well
known
,
and
be
much
esteem
by
the
latter
,
often
ride
over
to
hunt
and
fish
,
or
carouse
,
at
Downham
.
<EOS>
Parson
Holden
have
be
send
for
by
Bess
to
administer
spiritual
consolation
to
poor
Richard
Baldwyn
,
who
she
think
stand
in
need
of
it
,
and
have
respectfully
salute
the
magistrate
,
of
whom
he
stand
somewhat
in
awe
,
and
shake
hand
cordially
with
Nicholas
,
who
be
delighted
to
see
him
,
he
repair
to
the
inner
room
,
promise
to
come
back
speedily
.
<EOS>
and
he
keep
his
word
;
for
in
less
than
five
minute
he
reappear
with
the
satisfactory
intelligence
that
the
afflict
miller
be
considerably
calm
,
and
have
listen
to
his
counsel
with
much
edification
.
 
<EOS>
"
take
him
a
glass
of
aquavitæ
,
Bess
,
"
he
say
to
the
hostess
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
a
cup
too
low
,
and
will
be
the
well
for
it
.
<EOS>
strong
water
be
a
specific
I
always
recommend
under
such
circumstance
,
Master
Sudall
,
and
indeed
adopt
myself
,
and
I
be
sure
you
will
approve
of
it.--Harkee
,
Bess
,
when
you
have
minister
to
poor
Baldwyn
's
want
,
I
must
crave
your
attention
to
my
own
,
and
beg
you
to
fill
me
a
tankard
with
your
old
ale
,
and
toast
me
an
oatcake
to
eat
with
it.--I
must
keep
up
my
spirit
,
worthy
sir
,
"
he
add
to
Roger
Nowell
,
"
for
I
have
a
painful
duty
to
perform
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
when
I
have
be
more
shocked
than
by
the
death
of
poor
Mary
Baldwyn
.
<EOS>
a
fair
flower
,
and
early
nipped
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nipped

all
we
have

be
correct

Newell
.

"
<EOS>
the
forest
be
in
a
sad
state
,
reverend
sir
.
<EOS>
It
would
seem
as
if
the
enemy
of
mankind
,
by
mean
of
his
abominable
agent
,
be
permit
to
exercise
uncontrolled
dominion
over
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
needs
say
,
the
forlorn
condition
of
the
people
reflect
little
credit
on
those
who
have
them
in
charge
.
<EOS>
the
power
of
darkness
could
never
have
prevail
to
such
an
extent
if
duly
resist
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
lament
to
hear
you
say
so
,
good
Master
Nowell
,
"
reply
the
rector
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
my
good
,
I
assure
you

them
from

of
Mary

fall
a
victim
,
I
be
scarcely

for
the
mischance

<EOS>
rather
let
me
say
,
sir
,
that
you

as
an
active
and
zealous
magistrate
,
should
take
the
matter
in
hand
,
and
by
severe
deal
with
the
offender

arrest
the
progress
of
the
evil
.
<EOS>
no
defence

spiritual
or
otherwise

set
up
against
them

prove
effectual

,
reverend
sir

Potts

look
up
from
the
memorandum
book
in
which
he

<EOS>
I
be
sure
your
advice

upon
Master
Roger
Nowell
.

as

the
person
who
may
be
afflict
by
witchcraft

hath
not
<EOS>
our
sagacious
monarch
observe
,
that
'
there
be
three
kind
of
folk
who
may
be
tempt

trouble
:
the
wicked
for
their
horrible
sin

punish
them

measure

the
godly
that
be
sleep
in

great
sin

infirmity

weakness
in
faith

to
waken
them
up
the
faster
by
such
an
uncouth
form

even
some
of
the
good
,
that
their
patience
may

of
extraordinary
punishment
,
when

Him

as
well

the
ordinary
rod

sickness

adversity

'
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
true
,
sir
,
"
reply
Holden
.
<EOS>
"
and
we
be
undergo
this
severe
trial
now
.
<EOS>
fortunate
be
they
who
profit
by
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
hear
what
be
say
further
,
sir
,
by
the
king
,
"
pursue
Potts
.
"
<EOS>
'
no
man

declare
that
wise
prince
,
'
ought
to
presume
so
far
as
to
promise
any
impunity
to
himself
.
'
<EOS>
but
further
on
he
give
us
courage
,
for
he
add
,
'
<EOS>
and
yet
we
ought
not
to
be
afraid
for
that
,
of
any
thing
that
the
devil
and
his
wicked
instrument
can
do
against
us
,
for
we
daily
fight
against
him
in
a
hundred
other

therefore

at

combat

rummishe

clack

<EOS>
not

certain
what
may

on
him

even
so

boldly

go
forward

against
the
devil

I

I

I

here

ale

he
add

the
foam

cordial
wherewith

courage

<EOS>
"
some
remedy
must
be
find

observe
Roger
Nowell

after
a
few
moment

reflection

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
till
this
morning
I
be
not
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
evil
,
but
suppose
that
the
two
malignant
hag
,
who
seem
to
reign
supreme
here
,
confine
their
operation
to
blight
corn
,
maim
cattle
,
turn
milk
sour
;
and
even
these
report
I
fancy
be
greatly
exaggerated
;
but
I
now
find
,
from
what
I
have
see
at
Sabden
and
elsewhere
,
that
they
fall
very
far
short
of
the
reality

<EOS>
"
It
would
be
difficult
to
increase
the
darkness
of

what
remedy
will
you
apply
?

<EOS>

the
cautery

whether

the
chirurgeon
's
marvellous
story
be
listen
to
with
great
attention
by
his
auditor
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
be
familiar
with
different
version
of
it
;
but
to
Master
Potts
it
be
altogether
new
,
and
he
make
rapid
note
of
it
,
question
the
narrator
as
to
one
or
two
point
which
appear
to
him
to
require
explanation
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
be
particularly
interested
in
that
part
of
the
legend
which
refer
to
Isole
de
Heton
.
<EOS>
He
now
for
the
first
time
hear
of
her
unhallowed
intercourse
with
the
freebooter
Blackburn
,
of
her
compact
on
Whalley
Nab
with
the
fiend
,
of
her
mysterious
connection
with
Malkin
Tower
,
and
of
her
be
the
ancestress
of
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
the
consideration
of
all
these
point
,
couple
with
a
vivid
recollection
of
his
own
strange
adventure
with
the
impious
votaress
at
the
Abbey
on
the
previous
night
,
plunge
him
into
a
deep
train
of
thought
,
and
he
begin
seriously
to
consider
whether
he
may
not
have
commit
some
heinous
sin
,
and
,
indeed
,
jeopardise
his
soul
's
welfare
by
dance
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
what
if
I
should
share
the
same
fate
as
the
robber
Blackburn
,
"
he
ruminate
,
"
and
be
drag
to
perdition
by
her
?
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
awful
reflection
.
<EOS>
but
though
my
fate
may
operate
as
a
warning
to
other
,
I
be
by
no
means
anxious
to
be
hold
up
as
a
moral
scarecrow
.
<EOS>
rather
let
me
take
warn
myself
,
amend
my
life
,
abandon
intemperance
,
which
lead
to
all
manner
of
wickedness
,
and
suffer
myself
no
more
to
be
ensnare
by
the
wile
and
delusion
of
the
tempter
in
the
form
of
a
fair
woman
.
<EOS>
no
--
<EOS>
no
--
I
will
alter
and
amend
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
regret
,
however
,
to
say
that
these
praiseworthy
resolution
be
but
transient
,
and
that
the
squire
,
quite
forget
that
the
work
of
reform
,
if
intend
to
be
really
accomplished
,
ought
to
commence
at
once
,
and
by
no
means
be
postpone
till
the
morrow
,
yield
to
the
seduction
of
a
fresh
pottle
of
sack
,
which
be
present
to
him
at
the
moment
by
Bess
,
and
in
take
it
could
not
help
squeeze
the
hand
of
the
bounce
hostess
,
and
gaze
at

more
tenderly
than
become
a

Nicholas

Nicholas

<EOS>
the
work
of
reform
,
I
be
afraid
,
proceed
very
slowly
and
imperfectly
with
you
.
<EOS>
Your
friend
,
Parson
.
<EOS>
Dewhurst
,
would
have
tell
you
that
it
be
much
easy
to
form
good
resolution
than
to
keep
them
.
 
<EOS>
leave
the
squire
,
however
,
to
his
cogitation
and
his
sack
,
the
attorney
to
his
memorandum
-
book
,
in
which
he
be
still
engage
in
writing
,
and
the
other
to
their
talk
,
we
shall
proceed
to
the
chamber
whither
the
poor
miller
have
be
lead
by
Bess
.
<EOS>
when
visit
by
the
rector
,
he
have
be
apparently
soothe
by
the
worthy
man
's
consolatory
advice
,
but
when
leave
alone
he
speedily
relapse
into
his
former
dark
and
gloomy
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
notice
Bess
,
who
,
accord
to
Holden
's
direction
,
place
the
aquavitæ
bottle
before
him
,
but
,
as
long
as
she
stay
,
remain
with
his
face
bury
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
be
go
he
arise
,
and
begin
to
pace
the
room
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
the
window
be
open
,
and
he
could
hear
the
funeral
bell
toll
mournfully
at
interval
.
<EOS>
each
recurrence
of
the
dismal
sound
add
sharpness
and
intensity
to
his
grief
.
<EOS>
His
suffering
become
almost
intolerable
,
and
drive
him
to
the
very
verge
of
despair
and
madness
.
<EOS>
if
a
weapon
have
be
at
hand
,
he
may
have
seize
it
,
and
put
a
sudden
period
to
his
existence
.
<EOS>
His
breast
be
a
chaos
of
fierce
and
troubled
thought
,
in
which
one
black
and
terrible
idea
arise
and
overpower
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
desire
of
vengeance
,
deep
and
complete
,
upon
her
whom
he
look
upon
as
the
murderess
of
his
child
.
<EOS>
He
care
not
how
it
be
accomplish
so
it
be
do
;
but
such
be
the
opinion
he
entertain
of
the
old
hag
's
power
,
that
he
doubt
his
ability
to
the
task
.
<EOS>
still
,
as
the
bell
toll
on
,
the
fury
at
his
heart
lash
and
goad
him
on
,
and
yell
in
his
ear
revenge
--
revenge
!
<EOS>
now
,
indeed
,
he
be
craze
with
grief
and
rage
;
he
tear
off
handful
of
hair
,
plunge
his
nail
deeply
into
his
breast
,
and
while
commit
these
and
other
wild
excess
,
with
frantic
imprecation
he
call
down
Heaven
's
judgment
on
his
own
head
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
that
lost
and
helpless
state
when
the
enemy
of
mankind
have
power
over
man
.
<EOS>
nor
be
the
opportunity
neglect
;
for
when
the
wretched
Baldwyn
,
who
,
exhaust
by
the
violence
of
his
motion
,
have
lean
for
a
moment

he
perceive
to
his
surprise
that
there
be
a
man
in
the
room

a
small
personage
attire
in
rusty
black
,
whom
he
think
have
be
one
of
the
party
in
the
adjoining
chamber

<EOS>
there
be
an
expression
of
mockery
about
this
person
's
countenance
which
do
not
please
the
miller
,
and
he
ask
him

sternly
,
what

CHAPTER
VII.--THE
PERAMBULATION
of
the
boundary
.
  
<EOS>
the
lane
along
which
Richard
Assheton
gallop
in
pursuit
of
Mother
Chattox
,
make
so
many
turn
,
and
be
,
moreover
,
so
completely
hem
in
by
high
bank
and
hedge
,
that
he
could
sec
nothing
on
either
side
of
him
,
and
very
little
in
advance
;
but
,
guide
by
the
clatter
of
hoofs
,
he
urge
Merlin
to
his
utmost
speed
,
fancy
he
should
soon
come
up
with
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
in
this
,
however
,
he
be
deceive
.
<EOS>
the
sound
that
have
lead
him
on
become
fainter
and
fainter
,
till
at
last
it
die
away
altogether
;
and
on
quit
the
lane
and
gain
the
moor
,
where
the
view
be
wholly
uninterrupted
,
no
trace
either
of
witch
or
reeve
could
be
discern
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
feeling
of
angry
disappointment
,
Richard
be
about
to
turn
back
,
when
a
large
black
greyhound
come
from
out
an
adjoin
clough
,
and
make
towards
him
.
<EOS>
the
singularity
of
the
circumstance
induce
him
to
halt
and
regard
the
dog
with
attention
.
<EOS>
on
near
him
,
the
animal
look
wistfully
in
his
face
,
and
seem
to
invite
him
to
follow
;
and
the
young
man
be
so
strike
by
the
dog
's
manner
,
that
he
comply
,
and
have
not
go
far
when
a
hare
of
unusual
size
and
grey
with
age
bound
from
beneath
a
gorse
-
bush
and
speed
away
,
the
greyhound
start
in
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
Aware
of
the
prevail
notion
,
that
a
witch
most
commonly
assume
such
a
form
when
desirous
of
escaping
,
or
perform
some
act
of
mischief
,
such
as
dry
the
milk
of
kine
,
<EOS>
Richard
at
once
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
hare
could
be
no
other
than
Mother
Chattox
;
and
without
pause
to
inquire
what
the
hound
could
be
,
or
why
it
should
appear
at
such
a
singular
and
apparently
fortunate
juncture
,
he
at
once
join
the
run
,
and
cheer
on
the
dog
with
whoop
and
holloa
.
 
<EOS>
old
as
it
be
,
apparently
,
the
hare
run
with
extraordinary
swiftness
,
clear
every
stone
wall
and
other
impediment
in
the
way
,
and
more
than
once
cunningly
double
upon
its
pursuer
.
<EOS>
but
every
feint
and
stratagem
be
defeat
by
the
fleet
and
sagacious
hound
,
and
the
hunt
animal
at
length
take
to
the
open
waste
,
where
the
run
become
so
rapid
,
that
Richard
have
enough
to
do
to
keep
up
with
it
,
though
Merlin
,
almost
as
furiously
excited
as
his
master
,
strain
every
sinew
to
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
way
the
chaser
and
the
chase
scour
the
dark
and
heathy
plain
,
skirt
moss
-
pool
and
clearing
dyke
,
till
they
almost
reach
the
but
-
end
of
Pendle
Hill
,
which
rise
like
an
impassable
barrier
before
them
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
the
chance
have
seem
in
favour
of
the
hare
;
but
they
now
begin
to
turn
,
and
as
it
seem
certain
she
must
fall
into
the
hound
's
jaw
,
Richard
expect
every
moment
to
find
her
resume
her
natural
form
.
<EOS>
the
run
have
bring
him
within
,
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
Barley
,
the
rude
hovel
compose
which
little
booth
be
clearly
discernible
,
the
young
man
begin
to
think
the
hag
's
dwelling
must
he
among
them
,
and
that
she
be
hurry
thither
as
to
a
place
of
refuge
.
<EOS>
but
before
this
could
be
accomplish
,
he
hope
to
effect
her
capture
,
and
once
more
cheer
on
the
hound
,
and
plunge
his
spur
into
Merlin
's
side
.
<EOS>
an
obstacle
,
however
,
occur
which
he
have
not
count
on
.
<EOS>
directly
in
the
course
take
by
the
hare
lie
a
deep
,
disuse
limestone
quarry
,
completely
screen
from
view
by
a
fringe
of
brushwood
.
<EOS>
when
within
a
few
yard
of
this
pit
,
the
hound
make
a
dash
at
the
fly
hare
,
but
elude
him
,
the
latter
spring
forward
,
and
both
go
over
the
edge
of
the
quarry
together
.
<EOS>
Richard
have
wellnigh
follow
,
and
in
that
case
would
have
be
inevitably
dash
in
piece
;
but
,
discover
the
danger
ere
it
be
too
late
,
by
a
powerful
effort
,
which
throw
Merlin
upon
his
haunch
,
he
pull
him
back
on
the
very
brink
of
the
pit
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
man
shudder
as
he
gaze
into
the
depth
of
the
quarry
,
and
see
the
jagged
point
and
heap
of
break
stone
that
would
have
receive
him
;
but
he
look
in
vain
for
the
old
witch
,
whose
mangle
body
,
together
with
that
of
the
hound
,
he
expect
to
behold
;
and
he
then
ask
himself
whether
the
chase
may
not
have
be
a
snare
set
for
him
by
the
hag
and
her
familiar
,
with
the
intent
of
lure
him
to
destruction
.
<EOS>
if
so

have

<EOS>

his
first
idea
be
to
proceed
to
Barley
,
which
be
now
only
a
few
hundred
yard
off
,
to
make
inquiry
respect
Mother
Chattox
,
and
ascertain
whether
she
really
dwelt
there
;
but
,
on
further
consideration
,
he
judge
it
good
to
return
without
further
delay
to
Goldshaw
,
lest
his
friend
,
ignorant
as
to
what
have
befall
him
,
may
become
alarmed
on
his
account
;
but
he
resolve
,
as
soon
as
he
have
dispose
of
the
business
in
hand
,
to
prosecute
his
search
after
the
hag
.
<EOS>
ride
rapidly
,
he
soon
clear
the
ground
between
the
quarry
and
Goldshaw
Lane
,
and
be
about
to
enter
the
latter
,
when
the
sound
of
voice
singe
a
funeral
hymn
catch
his
ear
,
and
,
pause
to
listen
to
it
,
he
behold
a
little
procession
,
the
meaning
of
which
he
readily
comprehend
,
wend
its
slow
and
melancholy
way
in
the
same
direction
as
himself
.
<EOS>
It

<EOS>
many
of

"
You

Master

remark
Richard

"
 
<EOS>
"
not

so

sir

"
reply
the

"
there
be
a
slight
difference

I
will
explain

you

<EOS>
the
word

the

_
meta

,
or
mark

be

a

may
chance
to
stand

be
the

lie
on

a

a
pool
,

a
bog

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
comprehend
the
distinction
,
"
reply
Richard

"
<EOS>
and
now
,
as
we
be
on
this
subject
,
"
he
add
to
the
reeve
,
"
I
would
gladly
know
the
precise
nature

"
 
<EOS>
"
My

be

offence
against
vert

present
them
at

next
court

<EOS>
It
be
also
my
business
to
drive
into
the
forest
such
wild
beast
as
have
stray
from
it
;
to
attend
to
the
lawing

expeditation
of
mastiff

to
raise
hue

cry
against
any
malefactor
or
trespasser
within
the
forest

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
the

Potts--'_Si

I

observe
Richard

<EOS>
while
this
conversation
have
be
go
on
,
the
party
have
proceed
well
on
their
way
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
the
road
,
which
consist
of
little
more
than
tract
of
wheel
along
the
turf
,
lead
along
a
plain
,
throw
up
into
heathy
hillock
,
and
then
pass
through
a
thicket
,
evidently
part
of
the
old
forest
,
it
bring
them
to
the
foot
of
a
hill
,
which
they
mount
,
and
descend
into
another
valley
.
<EOS>
here
they
come
upon
Pendle
Water
,
and
while
skirt
its
bank
,
could
see
at
a
great
depth
below
,
the
river
rush
over
its
rocky
bed
like
an
Alpine
torrent
.
<EOS>
the
scenery
have
now
begin
to
assume
a
savage
and
sombre
character
.
<EOS>
the
deep
rift
through
which
the
river
run
be
evidently
the
result
of
some
terrible
convulsion
of
the
earth
,
and
the
rocky
strata
be
strangely
and
fantastically
display
.
<EOS>
on
the
further
side
the
bank
rise
up
precipitously
,
consist
for
the
most
part
of
bare
cliff
,
though
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
tree
would
root
itself
in
some
crevice
.
<EOS>
below
this
the
stream
sink
over
a
wide
shelf
of
rock
,
in
a
broad
full
cascade
,
and
boil
and
foam
in
the
stony
basin
that
receive
it
,
after
which
,
grow
less
impetuous
,
it
run
tranquilly
on
for
a
couple
of
hundred
yard
,
and
be
then
artificially
restrain
by
a
dam
,
which
,
divert
it
in
part
from
its
course
,
cause
it
to
turn
the
wheel
of
a
mill
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
abode
of
the
unfortunate
Richard
Baldwyn
,
and
here
have
blossom
forth
the
fair
flower

untimely
gather

<EOS>
an
air
of
gloom
hang
over
this
once
cheerful
spot
:
its
very
beauty
contribute
to
this
saddening
effect
.
<EOS>
the
mill

race
flow
swiftly
and
brightly
on
;
but
the
wheel
be
stop
,
window
and
door
be
closed
,
and
death
keep
his
grim
holiday
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
no
one
be
to
be
see
about
the
premise
,
nor
be
any
sound
hear
except
the
bark
of
the
lonely
watch

dog
.
<EOS>
many
a
sorrow
glance
be
cast
at
this
forlorn
habitation
as
the
party
ride
past
it
,
and
many
a
sigh
be
heave
for
the
poor
girl
who
have
so
lately
be
its
pride
and
ornament
;
but
if
any
one
have
notice
the
bitter
sneer
curl
the
reeve
's
lip
,
or
catch
the
malignant
fire
gleam
in
his
eye
,
it
would
scarcely
have
be
think
that
he
share
in
the
general
regret

<EOS>
after
the
cavalcade
have
pass
the
mill
,
one
or
two
other
cottage
appear
on
the
near
side
of
the
river
,
while
the
opposite
bank
begin
to
be
clothe
with
timber

<EOS>
the
glen
become
more

more
contracted

and
a
stone
bridge
cross
the
stream

near
which

on

same
side
of

a

<EOS>
on

Mistress

habitation
come
in

and
it
be
point
out
by
Nicholas
to
Potts

who
contemplate
it
with
much
curiosity
.
<EOS>
in
his
eye
it
seem
exactly
adapt
to
its
owner
,
and
form
to
hide
dark
and
guilty
deed
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
stern

sombre

<EOS>
at
the

of

few
ancient
oak

sycamore

and
in

<EOS>
part

<EOS>
the

cut
up
into
paddock

and
the
approach

a
labyrinth
of
low
stone
wall

while
miserable

append
to
it

the
terrace
be
wholly
obliterated
;
and
the
grange
and
office
be
pull
down
,
but
sufficient
be
still
leave
of
the
place
to
give
an
idea
of
its
pristine
appearance
and
character
.
<EOS>
Its
situation
be
strike
and
peculiar
.
<EOS>
in
front
rise
a
high
hill
,
form
the
last
link
of
the
chain
of
Pendle
,
and
look
upon
Barrowford
and
Colne
,
on
the
further
side
of
which
,
and
therefore
not
discernible
from
the
mansion
,
stand
Malkin
Tower
.
<EOS>
at
the
period
in
question
the
low
part
of
this
hill
be
well
wooded
,
and
wash
by
the
Pendle
Water
,
which
sweep
past
it
through
bank
picturesque
and
beautiful
,
though
not
so
bold
and
rocky
as
those
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mill
.
<EOS>
in
the
rear
of
the
house
the
ground
gradually
rise
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
when
it

a
considerable
elevation
,
follow
the
course
of
the
stream
,
and
look
down
the
gorge
,
another
hill

so
that
the
house
be
completely
shut
in
by
mountainous
acclivity
.
<EOS>
in

when
the

lie
on
the
height
,
or
when
the
mist
hang
upon
them
for
week
together
,
or
descend
in
continuous
rain
,
Rough
Lee
be
sufficiently
desolate
,
and
seem
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
the
outer
world
;
but
at
the
season
when
the
party
behold
it
,
though
the
approach
be
rugged
and
difficult
,
and
almost
inaccessible
except
to
the
horseman
or
pedestrian
,
bid
defiance
to
any
vehicle
except
of
the
strong
construction
,
still
the
place
be
not
without
a
certain
charm
,
mainly
,
however
,
derive
from
its
seclusion
.
<EOS>
the
scenery
be
stern
and
sombre
,
the
hill
be
dark
and
dreary
;
but
the
very
wildness
of
the
place
be
attractive
,
and
the
old
house
,
with
its
grey
wall
,
<EOS>
its
lofty
chimney
,
its
garden
with
their

<EOS>
as
the
party
draw
near
the
house
,
the
gate
be
throw
open
by
an
old
porter
with
two
other
servant
,
who
besought
them
to
stay
and
partake
of
some
refreshment
;
but
Roger
Nowell
haughtily
and
peremptorily
decline
the
invitation

and
ride
on

and
the

though
some

<EOS>
scarcely

than
James

<EOS>
pass
through

receive
some
accession
from

as
well
as
from

hut
on
the

,
again
approach

and
proceed
along

bank

<EOS>
the

and
act
apparently
under
the
direction
of
James
Device
,
who
have
now
join
the
troop
,
stoutly
and
loudly
maintain
that
the
lady
would
be
find
right
in
the
inquiry
,
with
the
exception
of
one
old
man
name
Henry
Mitton
;
and
he
shake
his
head
gravely
when
appeal
to
by
Jem

and
could
by
no
effort
be
induce
to
join
him
in
the
clamour
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
demonstration
,
Roger
Nowell
and
his
legal
adviser
be
both
very
sanguine
as
to
the
result

and
Master

to

from
Sparshot
that
the
two
plan

which
have
be
roll
up
and
consign
to
his

be
quite
safe

<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
party
have
follow
the
course
of
Pendle
Water
through
the
glen
for
about
half
a
mile
,
during
which
they
keep
close
to
the
brawling
current
,
enter
a
little
thicket
,
and
then
strike
off
on
the
left
,
pass
over
the
foot
of
a
hill
,
and
come
to
the
edge
of
a
wide
moor
,
where
a
halt

<EOS>
It

Presently

between
the
two

with

behind
him

<EOS>
so
wonderfully
elated
be
Master
Potts
by
the
successful
hit
he
have
just
make
,
and
which
,
in
his
opinion
,
quite
counterbalance
his
previous
failure
,
that
he
could
not
help
communicate
his
satisfaction
to
Flint
,
and
this
in
such
manner
,
that
the
fiery
little
animal
,
who
have
be
for
some
time
exceedingly
tractable
and
good
-
natured
,
take
umbrage
at
it
,
and
threaten
to
dislodge
him
if
he
do
not
desist
from
his
vagary
--
deliver
the
hint
so
clearly
and
unmistakeably
that
it
be
not
lose
upon
his
rider
,
who
endeavour
to
calm
him
down
.
<EOS>
in
proportion
as
the
attorney
's
spirit
rise
,
those
of
James
Device
and
his
follower
sink
,
for
they
feel
they
be
catch
in
a
snare
,
from
which
they
could
not
easily
escape
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
they
have
reach
the
border
of
Worston
Moor
,
which
have
be
hitherto
conceal
by
a
piece
of
rise
ground
,
cover
with
gorse
and
brushwood
,
and
Jem
's
hut
,
together
with
the
clough
,
the
rindle
,
and
the
dyke
,
come
distinctly
into
view
.
<EOS>
the
plan
be
again
produce
,
and
,
on
compare
them
,
it
appear
that
the
various
landmark
be
precisely
situate
as
lay
down
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
while
their
disposition
be
entirely
at
variance
with
James
Device
's
statement
.
 
<EOS>
Master
Potts
then
rise
in
his
stirrup
,
and
call
for
silence
,
address
the
assemblage
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
stand
the
hut
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
instead
of
be
behind
the
clough
,
it
be
on
one
side
of
it
,
while
the
door
certainly
do
_
not
_
face
the
moor
,
neither
be
the
rindle
in
front
of
the
dwelling
or
near
it
;
while
the
dyke
,
which
be
the
main
and
important
boundary
line
between
the
property
,
run
above
two
hundred
yard
further
west
than
formerly
.
<EOS>
now
,
observe
the
original
position
of
these
mark
,
mere
,
and
boundary
--
that
is
,
of
this
hut
,
this
clough
,
this
rindle
,
and
this
dyke
--
exactly
correspond
with
the
description
give
of
them
by
the
man
Device
,
who
dwell
in
the
place
,
and
who
be
,
therefore
,
a
person
most
likely
to
be
accurately
acquaint
with
the
country
;
and
yet
,
though
he
have
only
be
absent
two
day
,
change
the
most
surprising
have
take
place
--
change
so
surprising
,
indeed
,
that
he
scarcely
know
the
way
to
his
own
house
,
and
certainly
never
could
find
the
path
which
he
have
describe
as
lead
to
Hook
Cliff
,
since
it
be
entirely
obliterate
.
<EOS>
observe
,
further
,
all
these
extraordinary
and
incomprehensible
change
in
the
appearance
of
the
country
,
and
in
the
situation
of
the
mark
,
mere
,
and
boundary
,
be
favourable
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
give
her
the
advantage
she
seek
over
my
honoured
and
honourable
client
.
<EOS>
They
be
set
down
in
Mistress
Nutter
's
plan
,
it
be
true
;
but
when
,
let
me
ask
,
be
that
plan
prepare
?
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
it
be
prepare
first
,
and
the
change
in
the
land
make
after
it
by
diabolical
fraud
and
contrivance
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
have
to
declare
this
to
you
,
Master
Nicholas
,
and
to
you
,
Master
Richard
,
but
such
be
my
firm
conviction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
mine
,
also
,
"
add
Nowell
;
"
and
I
here
charge
Mistress
Nutter
with
sorcery
and
witchcraft
,
and
on
my
return
I
will
immediately
issue
a
warrant
for
her
arrest
.
<EOS>
sparshot
,
I
command
you
to
attach
the
person
of

abet
her
in

foul
practice

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
help
you
to
take
charge
of
him
,
"
say
the
reeve
,
ride
forward
.
 
<EOS>
probably
this
be
do
to
give
Jem
a
chance
of
escape
,
and
if
so
,
it
be
successful
,
for
as
the
reeve
push
among
his
captor
,
and
thrust
Sparshot
aside
,
the
ruffian
break
from
them
;
and
run
with
great
swiftness
across
the
moor
,
plunge
into
the
clough
,
and
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
and
Richard
instantly
give
chase
,
as
do
Master
Potts
,
but
the
fugitive
lead
them
over
the
treacherous
bog
in
such
a
manner
as
to
baffle
all
pursuit
.
<EOS>
a
second
disaster
here
overtook
the
unlucky
attorney
,
and
damp
him
in
his
hour
of
triumph
.
<EOS>
Flint
,
who
have
apparently
not
forget
or
forgive
the
joyous
kick
he
have
recently
receive
from
the
attorney
's
heel
,
come
to
a
sudden
halt
by
the
side
of
the
quagmire
,
and
,
put
down
his
head
,
and
fling
up
his
leg
,
cast
him
into
it
.
<EOS>
while
Potts
be
scramble
out
,
the
animal
gallop
off
in
the
direction
of
the
clough
,
and
have
just
reach
it
when
he
be
seize
upon
by
James

suddenly
start
from
the

upon

CHAPTER
VIII.--ROUGH
LEE
.
  
<EOS>
on
return
from
their
unsuccessful
pursuit
of
James
Device
,
the
two
assheton
find
Roger
Nowell
harangue
the
hind
,
who
,
on
the
flight
of
their
leader
,
would
have
take
to
their
heel
likewise
,
if
they
have
not
be
detain
,
partly
by
the
energetic
effort
of
Sparshot
and
the
groom
,
and
partly
by
the
exhortation
and
menace
of
the
magistrate
and
Holden
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
two
or
three
contrive
to
get
away
,
and
flee
across
the
moor
,
whither
the
reeve
pretend
to
pursue
them
;
while
those
leave
behind
be
take
sharply
to
task
by
Roger
Nowell
.
 
<EOS>
"
listen
to
me
,
"
he
cry
,
"
and
take
good
heed
to
what
I
say
,
for
it
concern
you
nearly
.
<EOS>
strange
and
dreadful
thing
have
come
under
my
observation
on
my
way
hither
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
whole
village
stricken
as
by
a
plague
--
a
poor
pedlar
deprive
of
the
use
of
his
limb
and
put
in
peril
of
his
life
--
and
a
young
maiden
,
once
the
pride
and
ornament
of
your
own
village
,
snatch
from
a
fond
father
's
care
,
and
borne
to
an
untimely
grave
.
<EOS>
these
thing
I
have
see
with
my
own
eye
;
and
I
be
resolve
that
the
perpetrator
of
these
enormity
,
Mothers
Demdike
and
Chattox
,
shall
be
bring
to
justice
.
<EOS>
as
to
you
,
the
delude
victim
of
the
impious
hag
,
I
can
easily
understand
why
you
shut
your
eye
to
their
evil
doing
.
<EOS>
terrify
by
their
threat
you
submit
to
their
exaction
,
and
so
become
their
slave
--
slave
of
the
bond
-
slave
of
Satan
.
<EOS>
what
miserable
servitude
be
this
!
<EOS>
by
so
do
you
not
only
endanger
the
welfare
of
your
soul
,
by
league
with
the
enemy
of
Heaven
,
and
render
yourself
unworthy
to
be
class
with
a
religious
and
christian
people
,
but
you
place
your
life
in
jeopardy
by
become
accessory
to
the
crime
of
those
great
offender
,
and
render
yourself
liable
to
like
punishment
with
them
.
<EOS>
see
,
then
,
the
imminency
of
the
peril
in
which
you
stand
,
you
will
do
well
to
avoid
it
while
there
be
yet
time
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
your
only
risk
.
<EOS>
Your
servitude
to
Mistress
Nutter
be
equally
perilous
.
<EOS>
what
if
she
be
owner
of
the
land
you
till
,
and
the
flock
you
tend
!
<EOS>
You
owe
her
no
fealty
.
<EOS>
She
have
forfeit
all
title
to
your
service
--
and
,
so
far
from
aid
her
,
you
ought
to
regard
her
as
a
great
criminal
,
whom
you
be
bind
to
bring
to
justice
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
incontestable
proof
of
her
deal
in
the
black
art
,
and
can
show
that
by
witchcraft
she
have
alter
the
face
of
this
country
,
with
the
intent
to
rob
me
of
my
land
.
"
 
<EOS>
Holden
now
take
up
the
theme
.
<EOS>
"
the
finger
of
Heaven
be
point
against
such
robbery
,
"
he
cry
.
"
<EOS>
'
Cursed
be
he
,
'
saith
the
scripture
,
'
that
removeth
his
neighbour
's
landmark
.
'
<EOS>
and
again
,
it
be
write
,
'
Cursed
be
he
that
smiteth
his
neighbour
secretly
.
'
<EOS>
both
these
thing
hath
Mistress
Nutter
do
,
and
for
both
shall
she
incur
divine
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
neither
shall
she
escape
that
of
man
,
"
add
Nowell
,
severely
;
"
for
our
sovereign
lord
hath
enact
that
all
person
employ
or
reward
any
evil
spirit
,
shall
be
hold
guilty
of
felony
,
and
shall
suffer
death
.
<EOS>
and
death
will
be
her
portion
,
for
such
demoniacal
agency
<EOS>
most
assuredly
hath
she
employ
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
magistrate
here
pause
for
a
moment
to
regard
his
audience
,
and
read
in
their
terrified
look
that
his
address
have
produce
the
desire
impression
,
he
continue
with
increase
severity--
 
<EOS>
"
these
wicked
woman
shall
trouble
the
land
no
longer
.
<EOS>
They
shall
be
arrest
and
bring
to
judgment
;
and
if
you
do
not
heartily
bestir
yourself
in
their
capture
,
and
undertake
to
appear
in
evidence
against
them
,
you
shall
be
hold
and
deal
with
as
accessory
in
their
crime
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
hind
,
who
be
greatly
alarm
,
declare
with
one
accord
their
willingness
to
act
as
the
magistrate
should
direct
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
wisely
,
"
cry
Potts
,
who
by
this
time
have
make
his
way
back
to
the
assemblage
,
cover
from
head
to
foot
with
ooze
,
as
on
his
former
misadventure
.
"
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
and
the
two
old
hag
who
hold
you
in
thrall
would
lead
you
to
destruction
.
<EOS>
for
understand
it
be
the
firm
determination
of
my
respect

Master
Roger
Nowell
,
as
well
as

<EOS>
the

He

but

Master

be
of
opinion
that
,
as
they
be
in

neighbourhood

,
they
should
proceed
thither
at
once
,
and
effect
the
arrest

,
after
which
Mother

could
be
seek
out

<EOS>
the

second
Master

's
proposition
,
hope
that
the
time
occupy
by
the
visit
to
Malkin
Tower
would
prove
serviceable
to
Mistress
Nutter
;
for
they
do
not

that
intelligence

of

of

<EOS>
Old
Mitton
have
,
indeed

himself

heinous
offence

have

show

his

I

Mistress

if
I
fail
in

proof

she

I
have
little
fear
of

he
add
,
with
a
sinister

You
be

I

so

sharply

in
make
the
charge

would
hesitate

bring
an
accusation
even
where

guilt

suspicion

the

forth

<EOS>
a
slight
smile

exchange
between
the
lover
;

it
be
evident
,
from
her
anxious
look

that
Alizon

him
sharply

without

blow

take
down

affected

demean
yourself
valiantly

eye

now
,
Alizon

to
our
chamber

"
 
<EOS>
Richard
do
not
hazard
a
look
at
the
young
girl
as
she
quit
the
hall
with
her
mother
,
but
follow
the
squire
mechanically
into
the
garden
,
where
they
find
the
horse
.
<EOS>
scarcely
be
they
mount
than
a
loud
hubbub
,
arise
from
the
little
village
,
proclaim
that
their
opponent
have
arrive
,
and
presently
after
a
large
company
of
horse
and
foot
appear
at
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
at
sight
of
the
large
force
bring
against
them
,
the
countenance
of
the
squire
lose
its
confident
and
jovial
expression
.
<EOS>
Pie
count
nearly
forty
man
,
each
of
whom
be
armed
in
some
way
or
other
,
and
begin
to
fear
the
affair
would
terminate
awkwardly
,
and
entail
unpleasant
consequence
upon
himself
and
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
therefore
,
by
no
mean
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
as
to
Richard
,
he
do
not
dare
to
ask
himself
how
thing
would
end
,
neither
do
he
know
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
His
mind
be
in
utter
confusion
,
and
his
breast
oppress
as
if
by
a
nightmare
.
<EOS>
He
cast
one
look
towards
the
upper
window
,
and
beheld
at
it
the
white
face
of
Mistress
Nutter
,
intently
gaze
at
what
be
go
forward
,
but
Alizon
be
not
to
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
within
the
last
half
hour
the
sky
have
darken
,
and
a
heavy
cloud
hang
over
the
house
,
threaten
a
storm
.
<EOS>
Richard
hope
it
would
come
on
fiercely
and
fast
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Roger
Newell
have
dismount
and
advanced
to
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
he
cry
,
address
the
two
assheton
,
"
I
expect
to
find
free
access
give
to
me
and
my
follower
;
but
as
these
gate
be
still
bar
against
me
,
I
call
upon
you
,
as
loyal
subject
of
the
King
,
not
to
resist
or
impede
the
course
of
law
,
but
to
throw
them
instantly
open

<EOS>
"
You
must
unbar
them
yourself

Master
Nowell
,
"

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
We
shall
give
you
no
help

<EOS>

nor
offer
any
opposition

I
hope

sir

the
magistrate

sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
twenty
to
one
,

thereabout

return
the
squire
,
with
a
laugh
;
"
we
shall
stand
a
poor
chance
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
other
defensive
and
offensive
preparation
have
be
make
,
I
doubt
not
,
"
say
Nowell
;
"
nay
,
I
descry
some
armed
man
through
the
window
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
before
come
to
extremity
,
I
will
make
a
last
appeal
to
you
and
your
kinsman
.
<EOS>
I
have
grant
Mistress
Nutter
and
the
girl
with
her
an
hour
's
delay
,
in
the
hope
that
,
see
the
futility
of
resistance
,
they
would
quietly
surrender
.
<EOS>
but
I
find
my
clemency
throw
away
,
and
undue
advantage
take
of
the
time
allow
for
respite
;
therefore
,
I
shall
show
them
no
further
consideration
.
<EOS>
but
to
you
,
my
friend
,
I
would
offer
a
last
warning
.
<EOS>
forget
not
that
you
be
act
in
direct
opposition
to
the
law
;
that
we
be
here
armed
with
full
authority
and
power
to
carry
out
our
intention
;
and
that
all
opposition
on
your
part
will
be
fruitless
,
and
will
be
visit
upon
you
hereafter
with
severe
pain
and
penalty
.
<EOS>
forget
not
,
also
,
that
your
character
will
be
irrecoverably
damage
from
your
connexion
with
party
charge
with
the
heinous
offence
of
witchcraft
.
<EOS>
Meddle
not
,
therefore
,
in
the
matter
,
but
go
your
way
,
or
,
if
you
would
act
as
best
become
you
,
aid
me
in
the
arrest
of
the
offender
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Master
Roger
Nowell
,
"
reply
Nicholas
,
walk
his
horse
slowly
towards
the
gate
,
"
as
you
have
give
me
a
caution
,
I
will
give
you
one
in
return
;
and
that
is
,
to
put
a
bridle
on
your
tongue
when
you
address
gentleman
,
or
,
by
my
fay
,
you
be
likely
to
get
answer
little
to
your
taste
.
<EOS>
You
have
say
that
our
character
be
likely
to
suffer
in
this
transaction
,
but
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
they
will
not
suffer
so
much
as
your
own
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
who
use
the
arm
of
the
law
for
purpose
of
private
vengeance
,
and
who
bring
a
false
and
foul
charge
against
his
enemy

know
that
it
can
not

repel
,
be
not
entitle

any
particular
respect

<EOS>
thus
have
you
act
towards
Mistress
Nutter

<EOS>
defeat
by
her
in
the
boundary
question
,
without
leave
its
decision
to
those
to
whom
you
have
refer
it
,
you
instantly
accuse
her
of
witchcraft
,
and
seek
to
destroy
her
,
as
well
as
an
innocent
and
unoffending
girl
,
by
whom
she
be
attend
.
<EOS>
be
such
conduct
worthy
of
you

likely
to
redound
to
your
credit

<EOS>
I
think
not

<EOS>

this
be
not
all

<EOS>
aid
by
your
crafty
and
unscrupulous
ally
,
Master
Potts
,
you
get
together
a
number
of
Mistress
Nutter
's
tenant
,
and
,
by
threat
and
misrepresentation
,
induce
them
to
become
instrument
of
your
vengeance
.
<EOS>
but
when
these
misguide
man
come
to
know
the
truth
of
the
case
--
when
they
learn
that
you
have
no
proof
whatever
against
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
that
you
be
influence
solely
by
animosity
to
her

they
be
quite
as
likely
to
desert
you
as
to
stand
by
you

<EOS>
at
all
event
,
we
be
determined
to
resist
this
unjust
arrest
,
and
,
at
the
hazard
of
our
life

to
oppose
your
entrance
into
the
house

"
 
<EOS>
Nowell

exasperate

its
consequence

<EOS>
many
of
those
who
have
be
induce
to
accompany
them
,
as
have
be
show
,
waver
in
their
resolution
of
act
against
Mistress
Nutter
,
but
they
now
begin
to
declare
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
in
vain
Potts
repeat
all
his
former
argument
.
<EOS>
They
be
no
long
of
any
avail
.
<EOS>
of
the
troop
assemble
at
the
gate
more
than
half
march
off
,
and
shape
their
course
towards
the
rear
of
the
house
--
with
what
intention
it
be
easy
to
surmise
--
while
of
those
who
remain
<EOS>
it
be
very
doubtful
whether
the
whole
of
them
would
act
.
 
<EOS>
the
result
of
his
oration
be
quite
as
surprising
to
Nicholas
as
to
his
opponent
,
and
,
enchant
by
the
effect
of
his
eloquence
,
he
could
not
help
glance
up
at
the
window
,
where
he
perceive
Mistress
Nutter
,
whose
smile
show
that
she
be
equally
well
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
see
that
,
if
any
further
desertion
take
place
,
his
chance
would
be
at
an
end
,
with
a
menacing
gesture
at
the
squire
,
Roger
Nowell
order
the
attack
to
commence
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
while
some
of
his
man
,
amongst
whom
be
Baldwyn
and
old
Mitton
,
batter
against
the
gate
with
stone
,
another
party
,
head
by
Potts
,
scale
the
wall
,
which
,
though
of
considerable
height
,
present
no
very
serious
obstacle
in
the
way
of
active
assailant
.
<EOS>
elevate
on
the
shoulder
of
Sparshot
,
Potts
be
soon
on
the
summit
of
the
wall
,
and
be
about
to
drop
into
the
garden
,
when
he
hear
a
sound
that
cause
him
to
suspend
his
intention
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
about
to
do
,
cousin
Nicholas
?
"
inquire
Richard
,
as
the
word
of
assault
be
give
by
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
loose
Mistress
Nutter
's
stag
-
hound
upon
them
,
"
reply
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
keep
in
leash
by
a
varlet
station
behind
yon
yew
-
tree
hedge
,
who
only
await
my
signal
to
let
them
slip
;
and
by
my
faith
it
be
time
he
have
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
apply
a
dog
-
whistle
to
his
lip
,
and
,
blow
a
loud
call
,
it
be
immediately
answer
by
a
savage
barking
,
and
half
a
dozen
hound
,
rough
-
haired
,
of
prodigious
size
and
power
,
resemble
in
make
,
colour
,
and
ferocity
,
the
irish
wolf
-
hound
bound
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
aha
!
"
exclaim
Nicholas
,
clap
his
hand
to
encourage
them
:
"
we
could
have
disperse
the
whole
rout
with
these
assistant
.
<EOS>
Hyke
,
tristam!--hyke
,
Hubert
!
<EOS>
upon
them!--upon
them
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
savage
barking
of
the
hound
that
have
catch
the
ear
of
the
alarmed
attorney
,
and
make
him
desirous
to
scramble
back
again
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
no
such
easy
matter
.
<EOS>
Sparshot
's
broad
shoulder
be
want
to
place
his
foot
upon
,
and
while
he
be
bruise
his
knee
against
the
roughen
side
of
the
wall
in
vain
attempt
to
raise
himself
to
the
top
of
it
unaided
,
Hubert
's
sharp
tooth
meet
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
,
while
those
of
Tristam
be
fix
in
the
skirt
of
his
doublet
,
and
penetrate
deeply
into
the
flesh
that
fill
it
.
<EOS>
a
terrific
yell
proclaim
the
attorney
's
anguish
and
alarm
,
and
he
redouble
his
effort
to
escape
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
before
it
be
difficult
to
get
up
,
the
feat
be
now
impossible
.
<EOS>
all
he
could
do
be
to
cling
with
desperate
tenacity
to
the
coping
of
the
wall
,
for
he
make
no
doubt
,
if
drag
down
,
he
should
be
tear
in
piece
.
<EOS>
roar
lustily
for
help
,
he
beseech
Nicholas
to
have
compassion
upon
him
;
but
the
squire
appear
little
move
by
his
distress
,
and
laugh
heartily
at
his
yell
and
vociferation
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
come
again
on
a
like
errand
,
in
a
hurry

I
fancy
Master
Potts

he

They

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
I

upon
the

over
it
upon
the
other
side

alight
upon
the
head
of
his
respected
and
singular
good
client
,
whom
he
bring
to
the
ground

<EOS>
meanwhile
,
all
those
unlucky
person
who
have
succeed
in
scale
the
wall
be
attack
by
the
hound
,
and
,
unable
to
stand
against
them
,
be
chase
round
the
garden
,
to
the
infinite
amusement
of
the
squire
.
<EOS>
frightened
to
death
,
and
unable
otherwise
to
escape
,
for
the
gate
allow
them
no
means
of
exit
,
the
poor
wretch

towards
the
terrace

Pendle
Water

and
,
leap
into
the
stream

gain
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
there
they
be
safe
,
for
the
hound

them
further
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
the
garden
be
completely
clear
of
the
enemy
,
and
Nicholas
and
Richard
be
leave
master
of
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
lean
out
of
the
window
,
Mistress
Nutter
laughingly
congratulate
them
on
their
success
,
and
,
as
no
further
disposition
be
manifest
on
the
part
of
Nowell
and
such
of
his
troop
that
remain
to
renew
the
attack
,
the
contest
,
for
the
present
at
least
,
be
suppose
to
be
at
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
also
,
intimation
have
be
convey
by
the
deserter
from
Nowell
's
troop
,
who
,
it
will
be
remember
,
have
make
their
way
to
the
back
of
the
premise
,
that
they
be
anxious
to
offer
their
service
to
Mistress
Nutter
;
and

as
soon
as
this

she
order

<EOS>
thus
thing
wear
a
promising
aspect
for
the
besiege

while
the
assail
party
be
proportionately
dishearten

<EOS>
long
ere
this
,
<EOS>
Baldwyn
and
old
Mitton
have
desist
from
their
attempt
to
break
open
the
gate
,
and
,
indeed
,
rejoice
that
such
a
barrier
be
interpose
between
them
and
the
hound
,
whose
furious
onslaught
they
witness
.
<EOS>
a
bolt
be
launch
against
these
four
-
footed
guardian
of
the
premise
by
the
bearer
of
the
crossbow
,
but
the
man
prove
but
an
indifferent
marksman
,
for
,
instead
of
hit
the
hound
,
he
disable
one
of
his
companion
who
be
battle
with
him
.
<EOS>
find
thing
in
this
state
,
and
that
neither
Nowell
nor
Potts
return
to
their
charge
,
while
their
follower
be
withdraw
from
before
the
gate
,
Nicholas
think
he
may
fairly
infer
that
a
victory
have
be
obtain
.
<EOS>
but
,
like
a
prudent
leader
,
he
do
not
choose
to
expose
himself
till
the
enemy
have
absolutely
yield
,
and
he
therefore
sign
to
Blackadder
and
his
man
to
come
forth
from
the
hall
.
<EOS>
the
order
be
obey
,
not
only
by
them
,
but
by
the
seceder
from
the
hostile
troop
,
and
some
thirty
man
issue
from
the
principal
door
,
and
,
range
themselves
upon
the
lawn
,
set
up
a
deafening
and
triumphant
shout
,
very
different
from
that
raise
by
the
same
individual
when
under
the
command
of
Nowell
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
moment
Mistress
Nutter
and
Alizon
appear
at
the
door
,
and
at
the
sight
of
them
the
shouting
be
renew
.
 
<EOS>
the
unexpected
turn
in
affair
have
not
be
without
its
effect
upon
Richard
and
Alizon
,
and
tend
to
revive
the
spirit
of
both
.
<EOS>
the
immediate
danger
by
which
they
be
threaten
have
vanish
,
and
time
be
give
for
the
consideration
of
new
plan
.
<EOS>
Richard
have
be
firmly
resolve
to
take
no
further
part
in
the
affray
than
should
be
require
for
the
protection
of
Alizon
,
and
,
consequently
,
it
be
no
little
satisfaction
to
him
to
reflect
that
the
victory
have
be
accomplish
without
him
,
and
by
mean
which
could
not
afterwards
be
question
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Mistress
Nutter
have
join
Nicholas
,
and
the

they

Poor

on

You

lesson

Master

Mistress
Nutter
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
come
hither
to
taunt
you

<EOS>
I
be
quite
satisfied
with
the
victory
I
have
obtain
,
and
be
anxious
to
put
an
end
to
the
misunderstanding
between
us

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I

Nowell
;

I

escape
now

a
day
of
reckoning

"
Your

calmly

"
be

that
I

<EOS>
"
I

sternly

I

at
this

I

happy
to

in

CHAPTER
X.--ROGER
NOWELL
and
his
DOUBLE
.
  
<EOS>
the
magistrate
be
usher
by
the
lady
into
a
small
chamber
,
open
out
of
the
entrance
-
hall
,
which
,
in
consequence
of
have
only
one
small
narrow
window
,
with
a
clip
yew
-
tree
before
it
,
be
extremely
dark
and
gloomy
.
<EOS>
the
wall
be
cover
with
sombre
tapestry
,
and
on
enter
,
Mistress
Nutter
not
only
carefully
close
the
door
,
but
draw
the
arra
before
it
,
so
as
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
their
conversation
be
hear
outside
.
<EOS>
these
precaution
take
,
she
motion
the
magistrate
to
a
chair
,
and
seat
herself
opposite
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
can
now
deal
unreservedly
with
each
other
,
Master
Nowell
,
"
she
say
,
fix
her
eye
steadily
upon
him
;
"
and
,
as
our
discourse
can
not
be
overhear
and
repeat
,
may
use
perfect
freedom
of
speech
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
it
,
"
reply
Nowell
,
"
because
it
will
save
circumlocution
,
which
I
dislike
;
and
therefore
,
before
proceed
further
,
I
must
tell
you
,
directly
and
distinctly
,
that
if
there
be
aught
of
witchcraft
in
what
you
be
about
to
propose
to
me
,
I
will
have
nought
to
do
with
it
,
and
our
conference
may
as
well
never
begin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
really
believe
me
to
be
a
witch
?
"
say
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
reply
Nowell
,
unflinchingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
since
you
believe
this
,
you
must
also
believe
that
I
have
absolute

I

<EOS>
My
motive
for
wish
you

with
Mistress
Nutter

request
be
this
:
We
be
in

from

there

my

prevent
me

know
your

I
apprehend
that
,
find
the
table
turn
against
you
,
you
would
not
desire
to
play
a
lose
game
,
and
I
therefore
counsel
apparent
submission
as
the
good
mean
of
disarm
your
antagonist

<EOS>
whatever
arrangement
you
have
make
with
Mistress

neither

bind
upon

that
Richard

Alizon

<EOS>
the
young

seem
doubtful
at

whether
to
comply
with
the
invitation

she
finally
assent

they
go
forth

for
Nicholas

fancy
they
could
dispense

only
attend

the

I
be
scarcely
do
right
in

Dick
to
entangle
himself
in
this
fashion

<EOS>

where
be
the
use
of
give
advice
to
a
young
man
who
be
over
head
and
ear
in
love
?
<EOS>
He
will
never
listen
to
it

and
will
only
resent
interference

<EOS>
Dick
must
take
his
chance

<EOS>
I
have
already
point
out
the
danger
to
him

if
he
choose
to
run
headlong
into
the
pit

why

I

him

after
all

I

Alizon

be
all
smooth

straightforward
in
her
history

there
could
be
no
reason

--
pshaw
!
<EOS>
I
be
as
foolish
as
the

Sir
Richard
Assheton

would
disown

no

nothing

misery

I

the

I

up

which
never

<EOS>
but
even
with
you
I
do
not

I
could
be
happy
here

<EOS>
there
be
something
about
the
house
which
,
when
I
first
beheld
it

fill
me
with
unaccountable
terror

<EOS>
never
since
I
be
a
mere
infant

have
I
be
within
it
till
to
-
day
,
and
yet
it
be
quite
familiar
to
me
--
horribly
familiar
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
hall
in
which
we
stand
together
,
with
its
huge
arched
fireplace
,
and
the
armorial
bearing
upon
it
,
and
could
point
out
the
stone
on
which
be
carve
my
father
's
initial

R.N.
,
'
with
the
date
'
1572

<EOS>
I
know
the
tapestry
on
the
wall
,
and
the
paint
glass
in
the
long
range
window
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
old
oak
staircase
,
and
the
gallery
beyond
it
,
and
the
room
to
which
my
mother
lead
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
portrait
paint
on
the
panel
,
and
at
once
recognise
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
great
carved
oak
bedstead
in

the
high
chimney

piece

the
raise
hearthstone

You

how
these

could

<EOS>
I

I

them
repeatedly

They
have
haunt
me
for

I
only
to

they
have
an
actual

in
any
way

with
my

<EOS>
the
sight
of
that
house
inspire
me
with
a
horror
I
have
not

able
to
overcome
;

I
have
a
presentiment

some
ill
will
befall
me
within

I
would
never

there

the
alder
,
neither
Alizon
,
nor
Jennet

nor
the
old
beldame

to
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
the
terrible
conviction
that
she
have
be
carry
off
by
Mother
Demdike
then
smote
him
,
and
though
he
continue
his
search
for
her
among
the
adjoining
bush
,
it
be
with
fearful
misgiving
.
<EOS>
no
answer
be
return
to
his
shout
,
nor
could
he
discover
any
trace
of
the
mean
by
which
Alizon
have
be
spirit
away
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
time
spend
in
ineffectual
search
,
uncertain
what
course
to
pursue
,
and
with
a
heart
full
of
despair
,
Richard
cross
the
river
,
and
proceed
towards
the
house
,
in
front
of
which
he
find
Mistress
Nutter
and
Nicholas
,
both
of
whom
seem
surprised
when
they
perceive
he
be
unaccompanied
by
Alizon
.
<EOS>
the
lady
immediately
,
and
somewhat
sharply
,
question
him
as
to
what
have
become
of
her
adopt
daughter
,
and
appear
at
first
to
doubt
his
answer
;
but
at
length
,
unable
to
question
his
sincerity
,
she
become
violently
agitate
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
poor
girl
have
be
convey
away
by
Mother
Demdike
,
"
she
cry
,
"
though
for
what
purpose
I
be
at
a
loss
to
conceive
.
<EOS>
the
old
hag
could
not
cross
the
running
water
,
and
therefore
resort
to
that
stratagem
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
must
not
be
leave
in
her
hand
,
madam
,
"
say
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
must
not

reply
the
lady

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
Blackadder

I

I
would
despatch
him
instantly
to
Malkin
Tower

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
instead
,
"

Richard

<EOS>
"
You
have
better
accept
his
offer
,

interpose
Nicholas
;

he
will
serve
you
as
well
as
Blackadder

I

<EOS>
"
come
,
then
,
with
me
,
"
say
the
lady

enter
the
house
,
"
and
I
will
furnish
you
with
that
which
shall
be
your
safeguard
in
the
enterprise

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
this
,
she
proceed
to
the
closet
where
her
interview
with
Roger
Nowell
have
be
hold
;
and
,
unlock
an
ebony
cabinet
,
take
from
a
drawer
within
it
a
small
flat
piece
of
gold
,
grave
with
mystic
character
,
and
have
a
slend
chain
of
the
same
metal
attach
to
it
.
<EOS>
throw
the
chain
over
Richard

neck
,
she

,
"
place
this
talisman

which
be
of
sovereign
virtue
,
near
your
heart

and
no
witchcraft
shall
have
power
over
you
.
<EOS>
but
be
careful
that
you
be
not
by
any
artifice
deprive
of
it
,
for
the
old
hag
will
soon
discover
that
you
possess
some
charm
to
protect
you
against
her
spell
.
<EOS>
You
be
impatient
to
be
go
,
but
I
have
not
yet

"
she
continue
,
take
down
a
small
silver
bugle
from
a
hook
,
and
give
it
him
.
"
<EOS>
on
reach
Malkin
Tower
,
wind
this
horn
thrice
,
and
the
old
witch
will
appear
at
the
upper
window
.
<EOS>
demand
admittance
in
my
name
,
and
she
will
not
dare
to
refuse
you
;
or
,
if
she
do
,
tell
her
you
know
the
secret
entrance
to
her
stronghold
,
and
will
have
recourse
to
it
.
<EOS>
and
in
case
this
should
be
needful
<EOS>
,
I
will
now
disclose
it
to
you
,
but
you
must
not
use
it
till
other
mean
fail
.
<EOS>
when
opposite
the
door
,
which
you
will
find
be
high
up
in
the
building
,
take
ten
pace
to
the
left
,
and
if
you
examine
the
masonry
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
,
you
will
perceive
one
stone
somewhat
dark
than
the
rest
.
<EOS>
at
the
bottom
of
this
stone
,
and
conceal
by
a
patch
of
heath
,
you
will
discover
a
knob
of
iron
.
<EOS>
touch
it
,
and
it
will
give
you
an
opening
to
a
vaulted
chamber
,
whence
you
can
mount
to
the
upper
room
.
<EOS>
even
then
you
may
experience
some
difficulty
,
but
with
resolution
you
will
surmount
all
obstacle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
fear
of
success
,
madam
,
"
reply
Richard
,
confidently
.
 
<EOS>
and
quit
her
,
he
proceed
to
the
stable
,
and
call
for
his
horse
,
vault
into
the
saddle
,
and
gallop
off
towards
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
fast
as
Richard
ride
up
the
steep
hill
-
side
,
still
faster
do
the
black
cloud
gather
over
his
head
.
<EOS>
no
natural
cause
could
have
produce
so
instantaneous
a
change
in
the
aspect
of
the
sky
,
and
the
young
man
view
it
with
uneasiness
,
and
wish
to
get
out
of
the
thicket
in
which
he
be
now
involve
,
before
the
threaten
thunder
-
storm
commence
.
<EOS>
but
the
hill
be
steep
and
the
road
bad
,
be
full
of
loose
stone
,
and
cross
in
many
place
by
bare
root
of
tree
.
<EOS>
though
ordinarily
surefoote
,
Merlin
stumble
frequently
,
and
Richard
be
oblige
to
slacken
his
pace
.
<EOS>
It
grow
dark
and
dark
,
and
the
storm
seem
ready
to
burst
upon
him
.
<EOS>
the
small
bird
cease
singing
,
and
screen
themselves
under
the
thick
foliage
;
the
pie
chatter
incessantly
;
the
jay
scream
;
the
bittern
fly
past
,
boom
heavily
in
the
air
;
the
raven
croak
;
the
heron
arise
from
the
river
,
and
speed
off
with
his
long
neck
stretch
out
;
and
the
falcon
,
who
have
be
hover
over
him
,
sweep
sidelong
down
and
seek
shelter
beneath
an
impending
rock
;
the
rabbit
scud
off
to
his
burrow
in
the
brake
;
and
the
hare
,
erect
himself
for
a
moment
,
as
if
to
listen
to
the
note
of
danger
,
creep
timorously
off
into
the
long
dry
grass
.
 
<EOS>
It
grow
so
dark
at
last
that
the
road
be
difficult
to
discern
,
and
the
dense
row
of
tree
on
either
side
assume
a
fantastic
appearance
in
the
deep
gloom
.
<EOS>
Richard
be
now
more
than
half
-
way
up
the
hill
,
and
the
thicket
have
become
more
tangled
and
intricate
,
and
the
road
narrower
and
more
rugged
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
Merlin
stop
,
quiver
in
every
limb
,
as
if
in
extremity
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
before
the
rider
,
and
right
in
his
path
,
glare
a
pair
of
red
fiery
orb
,
with
something
dusky
and
obscure
link
to
them
;
but
whether
of
man
or
beast
he
could
not
distinguish
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
call
to
it
.
<EOS>
no
answer
.
<EOS>
He
strike
spur
into
the
reek
flank
of
his
horse
.
<EOS>
the
animal
refuse
to
stir
.
<EOS>
just
then
there
be
a
moaning
sound
in
the
wood
,
as
of
some
one
in
pain
.
<EOS>
He
turn
in
the
direction
,
shout
,
but
receive
no
answer
.
<EOS>
when
he
look
back
the
red
eye
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
then
Merlin
move
forward
of
his
own
accord
,
but
ere
he
have
go
far
,
the
eye
be
visible
again
,
glare
at
the
rider
from
the
wood
.
<EOS>
this
time
they
approach
,
dilating
,
and
increase
in
glow
intensity
,
till
they
scorch
him
like
burn
-
glass
.
<EOS>
bethink
him
of
the
talisman
,
Richard
draw
it
forth
.
<EOS>
the
light
be
instantly
extinguish
,
and
the
indistinct
figure
accompany
it
melt
into
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
once
more
Merlin
resume
his
toilsome
way
,
and
Richard
be
marvel
that
the
storm
so
long
suspend
its
fury
,
when
the
sky
be
rive
by
a
sudden
blaze
,
and
a
crackling
bolt
shoot
down
and
strike
the
earth
at
his
foot
.
<EOS>
the
affrighted
steed
rear
aloft
,
and
be
with
difficulty
prevent
from
fall
backwards
upon
his
rider
.
<EOS>
almost
before
he
could
be
bring
to
his
foot
,
an
awful
peal
of
thunder
burst
overhead
,
and
it
require
Richard
's
utmost
effort
to
prevent
him
from
rush
madly
down
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
the
storm
have
now
fairly
commence
.
<EOS>
Flash
follow
flash
,
and
peal
succeed
peal
,
without
intermission
.
<EOS>
the
rain
descend
hiss
and
spout
,
and
presently
run
down
the
hill
in
a
torrent
,
add
to
the
horseman
's
other
difficulty
and
danger
.
<EOS>
to
heighten
the
terror
of
the
scene
,
strange
shape
,
reveal
by
the
lightning
,
be
see
flit
among
the
tree
,
and
strange
sound
be
hear
,
though
overpower
by
the
dreadful
rolling
of
the
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
but
Richard
's
resolution
continue
unshaken
,
and
he
force
Merlin
on
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
proceed
far
,
however
,
when
the
animal
utter
a
cry
of
fright
,
and
begin
beat
the
air
with
his
fore
hoofs
.
<EOS>
the
lightning
enable
Richard
to
discern
the
cause
of
this
new
distress
.
<EOS>
coil
round
the
poor
beast
's
leg
,
all
whose
effort
to
disengage
himself
from
the
terrible
assailant
be
ineffectual
,
be
a
large
black
snake
,
seemingly
about
to
plunge
its
poisonous
fang
into
the
flesh
.
<EOS>
again
have
recourse
to
the
talisman
,
and
bend
down
,
Richard
stretch
it
towards
the
snake
,
upon
which
the
reptile
instantly
dart
its
arrow
-
shape
head
against
him
,
but
instead
of
wound
him
,
its
fork
tooth
encounter
the
piece
of
gold
,
and
,
as
if
stricken
a
violent
blow
,
it
swiftly
untwine
itself
,
and
flee
,
hiss
,
into
the
thicket
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
be
now
oblige
to
dismount
and
lead
his
horse
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
he
toil
slowly
up
the
hill
.
<EOS>
the
storm
continue
with
unabated
fury
:
the
red
lightning
play
around
him
,
the
brattling
thunder
stun
him
,
and
the
pelting
rain
pour
down
upon
his
head
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
no
more
molested
.
<EOS>
save
for
the
vivid
flash
,
it
have
become
dark
as
night
,
but
they
serve
to
guide
him
on
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
get
out
of
the
thicket
,
and
trod
upon
the
turf
,
but
it
be
render
so
slippery
by
moisture
,
that
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
foot
,
while
the
lightning
no
longer
aid
him
.
<EOS>
fear
he
have
take
a
wrong
course
,
he
stand
still
,
and
while
debate
with
himself
a
blaze
of
light
illumine
the
wide
heath
,
and
show
him
the
object
of
his
search
,
Malkin
Tower
,
stand
alone
,
like
a
beacon
,
at
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
's
distance
,
on
the
further
side
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
be
it
disturb
fancy
,
or
do
he
really
behold
on
the
summit
of
the
structure
a
grisly
shape
resembling
--
if
it
resemble
any
thing
human
--
a
gigantic
black
cat
,
with
roughen
stare
skin
,
and
flaming
eyeball
?
 
<EOS>
nerve
by
the
sight
of
the
tower
,
Richard
be
on
his
steed
be
back
in
an
instant
,
and
the
animal
,
have
in
some
degree
recover
his
spirit
,
gallop
off
with
him
,
and
keep
his
foot
in
spite
of
the
slippery
state
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
Erelong
,
another
flash
show
the
young
man
that
he
be
draw
rapidly
near
the
tower
,
and
dismount
,
he
tie
Merlin
to
a
tree
,
and
hurry
towards
the
unhallowed
pile
.
<EOS>
when
within
twenty
pace
of
it
,
mindful
of
Mistress
Nutter
's
injunction
,
he
place
the
bugle
to
his
lip
,
and
wind
it
thrice
.
<EOS>
the
summon
,
though
clear
and
loud
,
sound
strangely
in
the
portentous
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
have
the
last
note
die
away
,
when
a
light
shine
through
the
dark
red
curtain
hang
before
a
casement
in
the
upper
part
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
these
be
draw
aside
,
and
a
face
appear
,
so
frightful
,
so
charge
with
infernal
wickedness
and
malice
,
that
Richard
's
blood
grow
chill
at
the
sight
.
<EOS>
be
it
man
or
woman
?
<EOS>
the
white
beard
,
and
the
large
,
broad
,
masculine
character
of
the
countenance
,
seem
to
denote
the
,
former
,
but
the
garb
be
that
of
a
female
.
<EOS>
the
face
be
at
once
hideous
and
fantastic
--
the
eye
set
across
--
the
mouth
awry
--
the
right
cheek
mark
by
a
mole
shine
with
black
hair
,
and
horrible
from
its
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
visage
,
and
the
brow
brand
as
if
by
a
streak
of
blood
.
<EOS>
a
black
thrum
cap
constitute
the
old
witch
's
head
-
gear
,
and
from
beneath
it
her
hoary
hair
escape
in
long
elf
-
lock
.
<EOS>
the
low
part
of
her
person
be
hide
from
view
,
but
she
appear
to
be
as
broad
-
shoulder
as
a
man
,
and
her
bulky
person
be
wrap
in
a
tawny

colour
robe
.
<EOS>
throw
open
the
window
,
she
look
forth
,
and
demand
in
harsh
imperious
tones--
 
<EOS>
"
who

to
summon
Mother
Demdike
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
messenger
from
Mistress

reply
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
I

the
restitution
of
Alizon
Device

thou
hast
forcibly
and
wrongfully

"
 
<EOS>
"
Alizon
Device

rejoin
Mother

.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
knowest
thou
speakest
false

foul
hag

"
cry
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alizon
be
no
blood
of
thine

<EOS>
open
the
door
and
cast
down
the
ladder
,
or
I
will
find
other
mean
of
entrance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
try
them
,
then
,
"
rejoin
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
and
she
close
the
casement
sharply
,
and
draw
the
curtain
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
reconnoitre
the
building
for
a
moment
,
Richard
move
quickly
to
the
left
,
and
count
ten
pace
,
as
direct
by
Mistress
Nutter
,
begin
to
search
among
the
thick
grass
grow
near
the
base
of
the
tower
for
the
conceal
entrance
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
dark
to
distinguish
any
difference
in
the
colour
of
the
masonry
,
but
he
be
sure
he
could
not
be
far
wrong
,
and
presently
his
hand
come
in
contact
with
a
knob
of
iron
.
<EOS>
He
press
it
,
but
it
do
not
yield
to
the
touch
.
<EOS>
again
more
forcibly
,
but
with
like
ill
success
.
<EOS>
Could
he
be
mistake
?
<EOS>
He
try
the
next
stone
,
and
discover
another
knob
upon
it
,
but
this
be
as
immovable
as
the
first
.
<EOS>
He
go
on
,
and
then
find
that
each

Greater

at

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
human
in
her
countenance

infernal
light
gleam

set
eye

<EOS>
Her

evidently
unimpaire
by
age

I

Thy

would

me
of
mine

not

her
hair
be
as
white
as

her
knowledge
equal
to

<EOS>
after

on
his
perilous
mission
to
Malkin
Tower
,
Mistress
Nutter
retire
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
hold
long
and
anxious
self
-
communion
.
<EOS>
the
course
of
her
thought
may
be
gather
from
the
terrible
revelation
make
by
Mother
Demdike
to
Alizon
.
<EOS>
a
prey
to
the
most
agonising
emotion
,
it
may
be
question
if
she
could
have
endure
great
torment
if
her
heart
have
be
consume
by
live
fire
,
as
in
the
punishment
assign
to
the
damned
in
the
fabled
hall
of
Eblis
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
remorse
assail
her
,
and
she
feel
compunction
for
the
evil
she
have
commit
.
<EOS>
the
whole
of
her
dark
career
pass
in
review
before
her
.
<EOS>
the
long
catalogue
of
her
crime
unfold
itself
like
a
scroll
of
flame
,
and
at
its
foot
be
write
in
blaze
character
the
awful
word
,
JUDGMENT
and
CONDEMNATION
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
escape
--
none
!
<EOS>
hell
,
with
its
unquenchable
fire
and
unimaginable
horror
,
yawn
to
receive
her
;
and
she
feel
,
with
anguish
and
self
-
reproach
not
to
be
describe
,
how
wretche
a
bargain
she
have
make
,
and
how
dearly
the
brief
gratification
of
her
evil
passion
have
be
purchase
at
the
cost
of
an
eternity
of
woe
and
torture
.
 
<EOS>
this
change
of
feeling
have
be
produce
by
her
newly
-
awaken
affection
for
her
daughter
,
long
suppose
dead
,
and
now
restore
to
her
,
only
to
be
snatch
away
again
in
a
manner
which
add
to
the
sharpness
of
the
loss
.
<EOS>
She
see
herself
the
sport
of
a
juggling
fiend
,
whose
aim
be
to
win
over
her
daughter
's
soul
through
her
instrumentality
,
and
she
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
defeat
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
this
,
she
be
aware
,
could
only
be
accomplish
by
her
own
destruction
,
but
even
this
dread
alternative
she
be
prepared
to
embrace
.
<EOS>
Alizon
's
sinless
nature
and
devotion
to
herself
have
so
work
upon
her
,
that
,
though
she
have
at
first
resist
the
well
impulse
kindle
within
her
bosom
,
in
the
end
they
completely
overmaster
her
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
<EOS>
,
she
ask
herself
,
too
late
to
repent
?
<EOS>
be
there
no
way
of
break
her
compact
?
<EOS>
She
remember
to
have
read
of
a
young
man
who
have
sign
away
his
own
soul
,
be
restore
to
heaven
by
the
intercession
of
the
great
reformer
of
the
church
,
Martin
Luther
.
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
she
have
hear
of
many
other
,
who
,
on
the
slight
manifestation
of
penitence
,
have
be
rend
in
piece
by
the
Fiend
.
<EOS>
still
the
idea
recur
to
her
.
<EOS>
may
not
her
daughter
,
arm
with
perfect
purity
and
holiness
,
with
a
soul
free
from
stain
as
an
unspotted
mirror
;
may
not
she
,
who
have
avouch
herself
ready
to
risk
all
for
her
--
for
she
have
overhear
her
declaration
to
richard;--might
<EOS>
not
she
be
able
to
work
out
her
salvation
?
<EOS>
Would
confession
of
her
sin
and
voluntary
submission
to
earthly
justice
save
her
?
<EOS>
Alas!--no
.
<EOS>
She
be
without
hope
.
<EOS>
She
have
an
inexorable
master
to
deal
with
,
who
would
grant
her
no
grace
,
except
upon
condition
she
would
not
assent
to
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
throw
herself
on
her
knee
,
but
they
refuse
to
bend
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
pray
,
but
the
word
turn
to
blasphemy
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
weep
,
but
the
fountain
of
tear
be
dry
.
<EOS>
the
witch
could
never
weep
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
despair
and
frenzy
,
and
,
like
fury
,
lash
her
with
whip
of
scorpion
,
goad
her
with
the
memory
of
her
abomination
and
idolatry
,
and
her
infinite
and
varied
iniquity
.
<EOS>
They
show
her
,
as
in
a
swiftly
-
fleeting
vision
,
all
who
have
suffer
wrong
by
her
,
or
whom
her
malice
have
afflict
in
body
or
estate
.
<EOS>
They
mock
her
with
a
glimpse
of
the
paradise
she
have
forfeit
.
<EOS>
She
see
her
daughter
in
a
beatified
state
about
to
enter
its
golden
portal
,
and
would
have
cling
to
her
robe
in
the
hope
of
be
carry
in
with
her
,
but
she
be
drive
away
by
an
angel
with
a
flaming
sword
,
who
cry
out
,
"
Thou
hast
abjure
heaven
,
and
heaven
reject
thee
.
<EOS>
Satan

brand

upon
thy

,
thou
canst
never

here
.
<EOS>
down
to
Tophet
,
thou
witch
!
"
<EOS>
then
she
implore
her
daughter
to
touch
her
brow
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
;
and
,
as
the
latter
be
about
to
comply
,
a
dark
demoniacal
shape
suddenly
rise
,
and
,
seize
her
by
the
hair
,
plunge
with
her
down
--
down
--
million
of
mile
--
till
she
beheld
a
world
of
fire
appear
beneath
her
,
consist
of
a
multitude
of
volcano
,
roar
and
rage
like
furnace
,
boil
over
with
redhot
lava
,
and
cast
forth
huge
burning
stone
.
<EOS>
in
each
of
these
bed
of
fire
thousand
upon
thousand
of
sufferer
be
writhe
,
and
their
groan
and
lamentation
arise
in
one
frightful
,
incessant
wail
,
too
terrible
for
human
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
over
this
place
of
torment
the
demon
hold
her
suspend
.
<EOS>
She
shriek
aloud
in
her
agony
,
and
,
shake
off
the
oppression
,
rejoice
to
find
the
vision
have
be
cause
by
her
own
distemper
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
storm
,
which
have
obstruct
Richard
as
he
climb
the
hill
,
have
come
on
,
though
Mistress
Nutter
have

but
now
a
loud
peal
of
thunder

the
room

the

her

a

for

light
up
by
infernal

glare
at

from

him

"

I

I

You

it

all

I

,
and
blow

eye
the

fiercely
,
as
he
intrude
upon
their
privacy
,
they
glance
at
their
leader
to
ask
whether
they
should
turn
him
out
;
but
,
receive
no
encouragement
for
such
rudeness
,
they
content
themselves
with
scowling
at
him
from
beneath
their
bent
brow
,
twist
up
their
shaggy
mustache
,
and
trifle
with
the
hilt
of
their
rapier
.
<EOS>
Holden
open
his
business
at
once
;
and
as
soon
as
Sir
Thomas
hear
it
,
he
spring
to
his
foot
,
and
,
swear
a
great
oath
,
declare
he
would
storm
Rough
Lee
,
and
burn
it
to
the
ground
,
if
Mistress
Nutter
do
not
set
the
two
captive
free

it
be
then
agree
that

the
question
I
shall
put
to
you
,
truly
and
satisfactorily
<EOS>
,
I
will
have
you
take
out
into
the
yard
,
and
shoot
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
thus
much
premised
,
I
shall
proceed
with
my
examination
.
<EOS>
Master
Roger
Nowell
and
Master
Thomas
Potts
<EOS>
,
you
be
aware
,
be
unlawfully
detain
prisoner
by
Mistress
Alice
Nutter
.
<EOS>
now
I
have
be
call
upon
by
the
reverend
gentleman
here
to
undertake
their
liberation
,
but
,
before
do
so
,
I
desire
to
know
from
you
what
defensive
and
offensive
preparation
your
mistress
have
make
,
and
whether
you
judge
it
likely
she
will
attempt
to
hold
out
her
house
against
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
most
assuredly
she
will
,
"
reply
Blackadder
,
"
and
against
twice
your
force
.
<EOS>
rough
Lee
be
as
strong
as
a
castle
;
and
as
those
within
it
be
well
-
armed
,
vigilant
,
and
of
good
courage
,
there
be
little
fear
of
its
capture
.
<EOS>
if
your
worship
should
propose
term
to
my
mistress
for
the
release
of
her
prisoner
,
she
may
possibly
assent
to
them
;
but
if
you
approach
her
in
hostile
fashion
,
and
demand
their
liberation
,
I
be
well
assured
she
will
resist
you
,
and
well
assured
,
also
<EOS>
,
she
will
resist
you
effectually
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
approach
her
in
no
other
sort
than
that
of
an
enemy
,
"
rejoin
Sir
Thomas
;
"
but
thou
art
over
confident
,
knave
.
<EOS>
unless
thy
mistress
have
a
legion
of
devil
at
her
back
,
and
they
hold
us
in
check
,
we
will
force
a
way
into
her
dwelling

<EOS>
fire
and
fury
!
<EOS>
dost
presume
to
laugh
at
me
,
fellow

<EOS>
take
him
hence
,
and
let
him
be
soundly
cudgel
for
his
insolence
,
Gauntlet

"
 
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
,
your
worship
,
"
cry
Blackadder
,
"
<EOS>
I
only
smile
at
the
strange
notion
you
entertain
of
my
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
dost
mean
to
deny
that
she
be
a
witch
?
"
demand
Metcalfe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
if
your
worship
will
have
it
so
,
it
be
not
for
me
to
contradict
you
,
"
reply
Blackadder
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
ask
thee
be
she
not
a
servant
of
<EOS>
Satan?--dost
<EOS>
thou
not
know
it?--canst
<EOS>
thou
not
prove
it
?
"
cry
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
put
him
to
the
torture
to
make
him
confess
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
tie
his
thumb
together
till
the
blood
burst
forth
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
say
Gauntlet
.
 
<EOS>
"
or
hang
him
up
to
yon
beam
by
the
heel
,
"
suggest
Captain
Storks

<EOS>
"
on
no
account

"
interpose
Holden
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
bring
him
hither
to
be
deal
with
in
this
way
,
and
I
will
not
permit
it
.
<EOS>
if
torture
be
to
be
administer
it
must
be
by
the
hand
of
justice
,
into
which
I
require
him
to
be
deliver
;
and
then
,
if
he
can
testify
aught
against

he
will

make

it

torture
shall
never

Blackadder

doggedly
;

though
I
could
tell
much

I
choose

<EOS>
now
give
heed

me

Sir

You
will
never
take
Rough
Lee

still
less
its

<EOS>
"
what
be
thy
term

knave
?
<EOS>
"
exclaim
the
knight
,
ponder
upon
the
offer
.
"
<EOS>
and
take
heed
thou
triflest
not
with
me
,
or
I
will
have
thee
flog
within
an
inch
of
thy
life

<EOS>
"
They

<EOS>
"
beware
what

I

compromise
justice

who
,
while

assuredly
deceive

<EOS>
You
will
equally
deceive
him
in
feign
to

to
term
which
you

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
can
not

"
<EOS>
ejaculate
the
knight
,
highly
offended
;
"
I
would
have
you
to
know

sir
,
that
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
's
word

his
bond

that
whatsoever

but
for
the
respect
I
owe
your
cloth
,
I
would
give
you
a
very
different
answer
,
reverend
sir

<EOS>
but
since
you
have
choose
to
thrust
yourself
unasked
into
the
affair
,
I
take
leave
to
say
that
I

will

hear
this
knave

proposal

judge
for
myself
of
the
expediency

<EOS>
I
must
pray
you
therefore
,
to
withdraw

<EOS>
nay

peaceably

you

"
 
<EOS>
thus
enjoin
,
the
alsatian
captain
take
each
an
arm
of
the
rector
,
and
force
him
out
of
the
room
,
leave
Sir
Thomas
alone
with
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
greatly
incensed
at
the
treatment
he
have
experience
,
Holden
instantly
quit
the
house
,
hasten
to
the
rectory
,
which
adjoin
the
church
,
and
have
give
some
message
to
his
household
,
ride
off
to
Whalley
,
with
the
intention
of
acquaint
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
with
all
that
have
occur
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
remain
closet
with
the
prisoner
for
a
few
minute
,
and
then
come
forth
,
issue
order
that
all
should
get
ready
to
start
for
Rough
Lee
without
delay
;
whereupon
each
man
empty
his
flagon
,
pocket
the
dice
he
have
be
cog
,
push
aside
the
shuffle
-
board
,
leave
the
loggat
on
the
clay
floor
of
the
barn
,
and
,
grasp
his
weapon
--
halbert
or
caliver
,
as
it
may
be
--
prepared
to
attend
his
leader
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
do
not
relate
,
even
to
the
alsatian
captain
,
what
have
pass
between
him
and
Blackadder
;
but
it
do
not
appear
that
he
place
entire
confidence
in
the
latter
;
for
though
he
cause
his
hand
to
be
unbound
,
and
allow
him
in
consideration
of
his
wounded
state
to
ride
,
he
secretly
direct
Gauntlet
and
Storks
to
keep
near
him
,
and
shoot
him
through
the
head
if
he
attempt
to
escape
.
<EOS>
both
these
personage
be
provide
with
horse
as
well
as
their
leader
,
but
all
the
rest
of
the
party
be
on
foot
.
<EOS>
Metcalfe
make
some
inquiry
after
the
rector
,
but
find
he
be
go
,
he
do
not
concern
himself
further
about
him
.
<EOS>
before
start
,
the
knight
,
who
,
with
all
his
recklessness
,
have
a
certain
sense
of
honesty
,
call
the
girl
who
have
be
leave
in
charge
of
the
hostel
by
Bess
,
and
give
her
a
sum
amply
sufficient
to
cover
all
the
excess
of
his
man
,
add
a
handsome
gratuity
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
part
of
the
journey
be
accomplish
without
mischance
,
and
the
party
bade
fair
to
arrive
at
the
end
of
it
in
safety
;
but
as
they
enter
the
gorge
,
at
the
extremity
of
which
Rough
Lee
be
situate
,
a
terrific
storm
burst
upon
them
,
compel
them
to
seek
shelter
in
the
mill
,
from
which
they
be
luckily
not
far
distant
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
completely
desert
,
but
they
be
well
able
to
shift
for
themselves
,
and
not
over
scrupulous
in
the
manner
of
do
so
;
and
as
the
remain
of
the
funeral
feast
be
not
remove
from
the
table
,
some
of
the
company
sit
down
to
them
,
while
other
find
their
way
to
the
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
the
storm
be
of
long
continuance
,
much
longer
than
be
agreeable
to
Sir
Thomas
,
and
he
pace
the
room
to
and
fro
impatiently
,
ever
and
anon
walk
to
the
window
or
door
,
to
see
whether
it
have
in
any
degree
abate
,
and
be
constantly
doom
to
disappointment
.
<EOS>
instead
of
diminish
,
it
increase
in
violence
,
and
it
be
now
impossible
to
quit
the
house
with
safety
.
<EOS>
the
lightning
blaze
,
the
thunder
rattle
among
the
overhang
rock
,
and
the
swollen
stream
of
Pendle
Water
roar
at
their
foot
.
<EOS>
Blackadder
be
leave
under
the
care
of
the
two
Alsatians
,
but
while
they
have
shield
their
eye
from
the
glare
of
the
lightning
,
he
throw
open
the
window
,
and
,
spring
through
it
,
make
good
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
in
such
a
storm
it
be
in
vain
to
follow
him
,
even
if
they
have
dare
to
attempt
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
fume
and
fret
--
in
vain
he
heap
curse
upon
the
bully
for
their
negligence
--
<EOS>
in
vain
he
hurl
menace
after
the
fugitive
:
the
former
pay
little
heed
to
his
imprecation
,
and
the
latter
be
beyond
his
reach
.
<EOS>
the
notion
begin
to
gain
ground
amongst
the
rest
of
the
troop
that
the
storm
be
the
work
of
witchcraft
,
and
occasion
general
consternation
.
<EOS>
even
the
knight
's
anger
yield
to
superstitious
fear
,
and
as
a
terrific
explosion
shake
the
rafter
overhead
,
and
threaten
to
bring
them
down
upon
him
,
he
fall
on
his
knee
,
and
essay
,
with
unaccustomed
lip
,
to
murmur
a
prayer
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
interrupt
;
for
amid
the
deep
silence
succeed
the
awful
crash
,
a
mocking
laugh
be
hear
,
and
the
villainous
countenance
of
Blackadder
,
render
doubly
hideous
by
the
white
lightning
,
be
see
at
the
casement
.
<EOS>
the
sight
restore
Sir
Thomas
at
once
.
<EOS>
draw
his
sword
he
fly
to
the
window
,
but
before
he
could
reach
it
Blackadder
be
go
.
<EOS>
the
next
flash
show
what
have
befall
him
.
<EOS>
in
step
backwards
,
he
tumble
into
the
mill
-
race
;
and
the
current
,
increase
in
depth
and
force
by
the
deluge
rain
,
instantly
sweep
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
half
an
hour
after
this
,
the
violence
of
the
storm
have
perceptibly
diminish
,
and
Sir
Thomas
and
his
companion
begin
to
hope
that
their
speedy
release
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
latterly
the
knight
have
abandon
all
idea
of
attack
Rough
Lee
,
but
with
the
prospect
of
fair
weather
his
courage
return
,
and
he
once
more
resolve
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
move
about
among
his
follower
,
strive
to
dispel
their
fear
,
and
persuade
them
that
the
temp
be
only
the
result
of
natural
cause
,
when
the
door
be
suddenly
throw
open
,
give
entrance
to
Bess
Whitaker
,
who
bear
the
miller
in
her
arm
.
<EOS>
She
stare
on
see
the
party
assemble
,
and
knit
her
brow
,
but
say
nothing
till
she
have
deposit
Baldwyn
in
a
seat
,
when
she
observe
to
Sir
Thomas
,
that
he
seem
to
have
little
scruple
in
take
possession
of
a
house
in
its
owner
's
absence
.
<EOS>
the
knight
excuse
himself
for
the
intrusion
by
say
,
he
have
be
compel
by
the
storm
to
take
refuge
there
with
his
follower
--
a
plea
readily
admit
by
Baldwyn
,
who
be
now
able
to
speak
for
himself
;
and
the
miller
next
explain
that
he
have
be
to
Rough
Lee
,
and
after
many
perilous
adventure
,
into
the
particular
of
which
he
do
not
enter
,
have
be
bring
away
by
Bess
,
who
have
carry
him
home
.
<EOS>
that
home
he
now
feel
would
be
a
lonely
and
insecure
one
unless
she
would
consent
to
occupy
it
with
him
;
and
Bess
,
on
be
thus
appeal
to
,
affirm
that
the
only
motive
that
would
induce
her
to
consent
to
such
an
arrangement
would
be
her
desire
to
protect
him
from
his
mischievous
neighbour
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
thus
discourse
,
Old
Mitton
,
who
it
appear
have
follow
them
,
arrive
wellnigh
exhaust
,
and
Baldwyn
go
in
search
of
some
refreshment
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
storm
have
sufficiently
clear
off
to
allow
the
other
to
take
their
departure
;
and
though
the
miller
and
Bess
would
fain
have
dissuade
the
knight
from
the
enterprise
,
he
be
not
to
be
turn
aside
,
but
,
bid
his
man
attend
him
,
set
forth
.
<EOS>
the
rain
have
cease
,
but
it
be
still
very
dark
.
<EOS>
under
cover
of
the
gloom
,
however
,
they
think
they
could
approach
the
house
unobserve
,
and
obtain
an
entrance
before
Mistress
Nutter
could
be
aware
of
their
arrival
.
<EOS>
in
this
expectation
they
pursue
their
way
in
silence
,
and
soon
stand
before
the
gate
.
<EOS>
these
be
fasten
,
but
as
no
one
appear
to
be
on
the
watch
,
Sir
Thomas
,
in
a
low
tone
,
order
some
of
his
man
to
scale
the
wall
,
with
the
intention
of
follow
himself
;
but
scarcely
have
a
head
rise
above
the
level
of
the
brickwork
than
the
flash
of
an
arquebuss
be
see
,
and
the
man
jump
backwards
,
luckily
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
bullet
that
whistle
over
him
.
<EOS>
an
alarm
be
then
instantly
give
,
voice
be
hear
in
the
garden
,
mingle
with
the
furious
barking
of
hound
.
<EOS>
a
bell
be
ring
from
the
upper
part
of
the
house
,
and
light
appear
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
some
of
the
man
,
less
alarmed
than
their
comrade
,
contrive
to
scramble
over
the
wall
,
and
be
soon
engage
hand
to
hand
with
those
on
the
opposite
side
.
<EOS>
but
not
alone
have
they
to
contend
with
adversary
like
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
stag
-
hound
,
which
have
do
so
much
execution
during
the
first
attack
upon
the
house
by
Roger
Nowell
,
rage
amongst
them
like
so
many
lion
,
rend
their
limb
,
and
seize
their
throat
.
<EOS>
to
free
themselves
from
these
formidable
antagonist
be
their
first
business
,
and
by
dint
of
thrust
from
pike
,
cut
from
sword
,
and
ball
from
caliver
,
they
succeed
in
slaughter
two
of
them
,
and
drive
the
other
,
badly
wound
,
and
savagely
howl
,
away
.
<EOS>
in
do
this
,
however
,
they
themselves
have
sustain
considerable
injury
.
<EOS>
three
of
their
number
be
lie
on
the
ground
,
in
no
condition
,
from
their
broken
head
,
or
shatter
limb
,
for
renew
the
combat
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
so
far
as
the
siege
have
go
,
success
seem
to
declare

Sir

CHAPTER
XV.--THE
PHANTOM
MONK
.
  
<EOS>
many
hour
have
pass
by
,
and
night
have
come
on
--
a
night
profoundly
dark
.
<EOS>
Richard
be
still
lie
where
he
have
fall
at
the
foot
of
Malkin
Tower
;
for
though
he
have
regain
his
sensibility
,
he
be
so
bruise
and
shake
as
to
be
wholly
unable
to
move
.
<EOS>
His
limb
,
stiffened
and
powerless
,
refuse
their
office
,
and
,
after
each
unsuccessful
effort
,
he
sink
back
with
a
groan
.
 
<EOS>
His
sole
hope
be
that
Mistress
Nutter
,
alarm
by
his
prolonged
absence
,
may
come
to
her
daughter
's
assistance
,
and
so
discover
his
forlorn
situation
;
but
as
time
fly
by
,
and
nothing
occur
,
he
give
himself
up
for
lose
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
sudden
the
gloom
be
disperse
,
and
a
silvery
light
shed
over
the
scene
.
<EOS>
the
moon
have
break
through
a
rack
of
cloud
,
and
illumine
the
tall
mysterious
tower
,
and
the
dreary
waste
around
it
.
<EOS>
with
the
light
a
ghostly
figure
near
him
become
visible
to
Richard
,
which
under
other
circumstance
would
have
excited
terror
in
his
breast
,
but
which
now
only
fill
him
with
wonder
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
of
a
cistertian
monk
;
the
vestment
be
old
and
fade
,
the
visage
white
and
corpse
-
like
.
<EOS>
Richard
at
once
recognise
the
phantom
he
have
see
in
the
banquet
-
hall
at
the
Abbey
,
and
have
afterwards
so
rashly
follow
to
the
conventual
church
.
<EOS>
It
touch
him
with
its
icy
finger
,
and
a
dullness
like
death
shot
through
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
dost
thou
trouble
me
thus
,
unhappy
spirit
?
"
say
the
young
man
.
"
<EOS>
leave
me
,
I
adjure
thee
,
and
let
me
die
in
peace
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
wilt
not
die
yet
,
Richard
Assheton
,
"
return
the
phantom
;
"
and
my
intention
be
not
to
trouble
thee
,
but
to
serve
thee
.
<EOS>
without
my
aid
thou
wouldst
perish
where
thou
li
,
but
I
will
raise
thee
up
,
and
set
thee
on
thy
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
wilt
thou
help
me
to
liberate
Alizon
?
"
demand
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
concern
thyself
further
about
her
,
"
reply
the
phantom
;
"
she
must
pass
through
an
ordeal
with
which
nothing
human
may
interfere
.
<EOS>
if
she
escape
it
you
will
meet
again
.
<EOS>
if
not
,
it
be
better
thou
shouldst
<EOS>
be
in
thy
grave
than
see
her
.
<EOS>
take
this
phial
.
<EOS>
drink
thou
<EOS>
the
liquid
it
contain
,
and
thy
strength
will
return
to
thee
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
I
know
thou
art
not
send
hither
by
Mother
Demdike
to
tempt
me
?
"
demand
Richard
,
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
fall
into
her
snare
,
"
he
add
,
with
a
groan
.
 
<EOS>
[

"
I

reply
the

,
in
a
tone
that
do
not
admit
of

<EOS>
"
drink
,
and
fear

Richard
obey
,
and
the
next
moment
spring
to
his

<EOS>
"
Thou

<EOS>
he

.
<EOS>
"
I

fain

"
 
"

it
not

<EOS>
cry
the
phantom
;

but
depart
instantly
for
Pendle
Hill

"
 
<EOS>
"
wherefore
should
I
go
thither
?
"
demand
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
wilt
learn
anon
,
"
return
the
monk
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
thee
more
now
.
<EOS>
dismount
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
and
proceed
to
the
beacon
.
<EOS>
Thou
know'st
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
reply
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
there
a
fire
be
light
which

mean
to

all
England
in
a
blaze

"
<EOS>
and
which
lead
many

"
say
the
monk
,
in
a
tone
of
indescribable
sadness
.
<EOS>
"

alas
!
<EOS>
for
him
who
kindle
it

<EOS>
the
offence
be
not
yet
work
out

<EOS>
but
depart
without
more
delay
;
and
look
not
back
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
Richard
hasten
towards
the
spot
where
he
have
leave
Merlin
,
he
fancy
he
be
follow
by
the
phantom
;
but
,
obedient
to
the
injunction
he
receive
,
he
do
not
turn
his
head
.
<EOS>
as
he
mount
the
horse
,
who
neigh
cheerily
as
he
draw
near
,
he
find
he
be
right
in
suppose
the
monk
to
be
behind
him
,
for
he
hear
his
voice
call
out
,
"
linger
not
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
to
the
beacon!--to
the
beacon
!
"
 
<EOS>
thus
exhort
,
the
young
man
dash
off
,
and
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
find
Merlin
as
fresh
as
if
he
have
undergo
no
fatigue
during
the
day
.
<EOS>
It
would
almost
seem
,
from
his
spirit
,
that
he
have
partake
of
the
same
wondrous
elixir
which
have
revive
his
master
.
<EOS>
down
the
hill
he
plunge
,
regardless
of
the
steep
descent
,
and
soon
enter
the
thicket
where
the
storm
have
fall
upon
them
,
and
where
so
many
act
of
witchcraft
be
perform
.
<EOS>
now
,
neither
accident
nor
obstacle
occur
to
check
the
headlong
pace
of
the
animal
,
though
the
stone
rattle
after
him
as
he
strike
them
with
his
fly
hoof
.
<EOS>
the
moonlight
quiver
on
the
branch
of
the
tree
,
and
on
the
tender
spray
,
and
all
look
as
tranquil
and
beautiful
as
it
have
so
lately
be
gloomy
and
disturbed
.
<EOS>
the
wood
be
pass
,
and
the
last
and
steepest
descent
clear
.
<EOS>
the
little
bridge
be
at
hand
,
and
beneath
be
Pendle
Water
,
rush
over
its
rocky
bed
,
and
glitter
like
silver
in
the
moon
's
ray
.
<EOS>
but
here
Richard
have
wellnigh
receive
a
check
.
<EOS>
a
party
of
armed
man
,
it
prove
,
occupy
the
road
lead
to
Rough
Lee
,
about
a
bow
-
shot
from
the
bridge
,
and
as
soon
as
they
perceive
he
be
take
the
opposite
course
,
with
the
apparent
intention
of
avoid
them
,
they
shout
to
him
to
stay
.
<EOS>
this
shout
make
Richard
aware
of
their
presence
,
for
he
have
not
before
observe
them
,
as
they
be
conceal
by
the
intervention
of
some
small
tree
;
but
though
surprised
at
the
circumstance
,
and
not
without
apprehension
that
they
may
be
there
with
a
hostile
design
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
he
do
not
slacken
his
pace
.
<EOS>
a
horseman
,
who
appear
to
be
their
leader
,
ride
after
him
for
a
short
distance
,
but
find
pursuit
futile
,
he
desist
,
pour
forth
a
volley
of
oath
and
threat
,
in
a
voice
that
proclaim
him
as
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
.
<EOS>
this
discovery
confirm
Richard
in
his
supposition
that
mischief
be
intend
Mistress
Nutter
;
but
even
this
conviction
,
strengthen
by
his
antipathy
to
Metcalfe
,
be
not
sufficiently
strong
to
induce
him
to
stop
.
<EOS>
promise
himself
to
return
on
the
morrow
,
and
settle
account
with
the
insolent
knight
,
he
speed
on
,
and
,
pass
the
mill
,
track
the
rocky
gorge
above
it
,
and
begin
to
mount
another
hill
.
<EOS>
despite
the
ascent
,
Merlin
never
slacken
his
pace
,
but
,
though
his
master
would
have
restrain
him
,
hold
on
as
before
.
<EOS>
but
the
brow
of
the
hill
attain
,
Richard
compel
him
to
a
brief
halt
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
sky
be
comparatively
clear
,
but
small
cloud
be
sail
across
the
heavens
,
and
at
one
moment
the
moon
would
be
obscure
by
them
,
and
the
next
,
burst
forth
with
sudden
effulgence
.
<EOS>
these
alternation
produce
corresponding
effect
on
the
broad
,
brown
,
heathy
plain
extend
below
,
and
fantastic
shadow
be
cast
upon
it
,
which
it
need
not
Richard
's
heated
imagination
to
liken
to
evil
being
fly
past
.
<EOS>
the
wind
,
too
,
lie
in
the
direction
of
the
north
end
of
Pendle
Hill
,
whither
Richard
be
about
to
shape
his
course
,
and
the
shadow
consequently
troop
off
towards
that
quarter
.

the
vast
mass
of
Pendle

in
gloomy
majesty
before

be
throw
into
shade

except
at
its
crown
,
where
a
flood
of
radiance
rest

<EOS>
like
an
eagle
swoop
upon
his
prey
,
Richard
descend
into
the
valley
,
and
like
a
stag
pursue
by
the
huntsman
he
speed
across
it
.
<EOS>
neither
dyke
,
morass
,
nor
stone
wall
check
him
,
or
make
him
turn
aside
;
and
almost
as
fast
as
the
cloud
hurry
above
him
,
and
their
shadow
travel
at
his
foot
,
do
he
reach
the
base
of
Pendle
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
make
up
to
a
shed
,
which
,
though
empty
,
luckily
contain
a
wisp
or
two
of
hay
,
he
turn
Merlin
into
it
,
and
commence
the
ascent
of
the
hill
on
foot
.
<EOS>
after
attain
a
considerable
elevation
,
he
look
down
from
the
giddy
height
upon
the
valley
he
have
just
traverse
.
<EOS>
a
few
hut
,
form
the
little
village
of
Barley
,
lie
sleep
in
the
moonlight
beneath
him
,
while
further
off
could
be
just
discern
Goldshaw
,
with
its
embowered
church
.
<EOS>
a
line
of
thin
vapour
mark
the
course
of
Pendle
Water
,
and
thick
mist
hover
over
the
moss
.
<EOS>
the
shadow
be
still
pass
over
the
plain

<EOS>
press
on
,
Richard
soon
come
among
the
rock
protrude
from
the
high
part
of
the
hill
,
and
as
the
path
be
here
not
more
than
a
foot
wide
,
rarely
take
except
by
the
sheep
and
their
guardian
,
it
be
necessary
to
proceed
with
the
utmost
caution
,
as
a
single
false
step
would
have
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
after
some
toil
,
and
not
without
considerable
risk
,
he
reach
the
summit
of
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
bound
over
the
springy
turf
,
and
inhale
the
pure
air

that
exalt
region

his

and
new
elasticity

communicate
to
his
limb

<EOS>
He
shape
his
course
near
the
edge
of
the
hill
,
so
that
the
extensive
view
it
command
be
fully
display
.
<EOS>
but
his
eye
rest
on
the
mountainous
range
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
,
where
Malkin
Tower
be
situate

<EOS>
even
in
broad

the
accurse
structure
would
have
be
invisible
,
as
it
stand
on
the
further
side
of
the
hill
,
overlook
Barrowford
and
Colne
;
but
Richard
know
its
position
well
,
and
while
his
gaze
be
fix
upon
the
point
,
he
see
a
star
shoot
down
from
the
heavens
and
apparently
alight
near
the
spot
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
alarm
him
,
for
he
could
not
help
think
it
ominous
of
ill
to
Alizon
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
,
however
,
follow
to
increase
his
misgiving
,
and
erelong
he
come
in
sight
of
the
beacon
.
<EOS>
the
ground
have
be
gradually
rise
,
and
if
he
have
proceed
a
few
hundred
yard
further
,
a
vast
panorama
would
have
open
upon
him
,
comprise
a
large
part
of
Lancashire
on
the
one
hand
,
and
on
the
other
an
equally
extensive
portion
of
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
forest
and
fall
,
black
moor
and
bright
stream
,
old
castle
and
stately
hall
,
would
have
then
be
lay
before
him
as
in
a
map
.
<EOS>
but
other
thought
engross
him
,
and
he
go
straight
on
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
he
could
discern
he
be
alone
on
the
hill
top
;
and
the
silence
and
solitude
,
couple
with
the
ill
report
of
the
place
,
which
at
this
hour
be
say
to
be
often
visit
by
foul
hag
,
for
the
performance
of
their
unhallowed
rite
,
awaken
superstitious
fear
in
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
soon
by
the
side
of
the
beacon
.
<EOS>
the
stone
be
still
stand
as
they
have
be
rear
by
Paslew
,
and
on
look
at
them
he
be
astonish
to
find
the
hollow
within
them
fill
with
dry
furze
,
brushwood
,
and
fagot
,
as
if
in
readiness
for
another
signal
.
<EOS>
in
pass
round
the
circle
,
his
surprise
be
still
further
increase
by
discover
a
torch
,
and
not
far
from
it
,
in
one
of
the
interstice
of
the
stone
,
a
dark
lantern
,
in
which
,
on
remove
the
shade
,
he
find
a
candle
burning
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
clear
the
beacon
be
to
be
kindle
that
night
,
though
for
what
end
he
could
not
conjecture
,
and
equally
clear
that
he
be
bring
thither
to
fire
it
.
<EOS>
He
put
back
the
lantern
into
its
place
,
take
up
the
torch
,
and
hold
himself
in
readiness
.
 
<EOS>

an
hour

suddenly
,
a
hurtle
noise

it
seem
to
the
watcher
as

distance
from

CHAPTER
XVI.--ONE
O'CLOCK
!
  
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
and
Mother
Chattox
be
still
at
the
hut
,
impatiently
await
the
return
of
Fancy
.
<EOS>
but
nearly
an
hour
elapse
before
he
appear
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
have
detain
thee
so
long
?
<EOS>
"
demand
the
hag
,
sharply
,
as
he
stand
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
,
mistress
,
"
reply
Fancy
:
"
I
have
have
a
busy
time
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
and
think
I
should
never
accomplish
my
errand
.
<EOS>
on
arrive
at
Rough
Lee
,
I
find
the
place
invest
by
Sir
Thomas
Metcalfe
and
a
host
of
armed
man
,
who
have
be
send
thither
by
Parson
Holden
,
for
the
joint
purpose
of
arrest
you
,
madam
,
"
address
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
and
liberate
Nowell
and
Potts
.
<EOS>
the
knight
be
in
a
great
fume
;
for
,
in
spite
of
the
force
bring
against
it
,
the
house
have
be
stoutly
defend
by
Nicholas
Assheton
,
who
have
worst
the
besiege
party
,
and
capture
two
alsatian
captain
,
hanger
on
of
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
appear
in
the
character
of
an
enemy
,
I
be
immediately
surround
by
Metcalfe
and
his
man
,
who
swear
they
would
cut
my
throat
unless
I
undertake
to
procure
the
liberation
of
the
two
bravos
in
question
,
as
well
as
that
of
Nowell
and
Potts
.
<EOS>
I
tell
them
I
be
come
for
the
express
purpose
of
set
free
the
two
last
-
name
gentleman
;
but
,
with
respect
to
the
former
,
I
have
no
instruction
,
and
they
must
arrange
the
matter
with
Master
Nicholas
himself
.
<EOS>
upon
this
Sir
Thomas
become
exceedingly
wroth
and
insolent
,
and
proceed
to
such
length
that
I
resolve
to
chastise
him
,
and
in
so
do
perform
a
feat
which
will
tend
greatly
to
exalt
Richard
's
character
for
courage
and
strength
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
let
us
hear
it
,
my
doughty
champion
,
"
cry
Mother
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
"
while
Metcalfe
be
pour
forth
his
rage
,
and
menace
me
with
uplifted
hand
,
"
pursue
the
familiar
,
"
I
seize
him
by
the
throat
,
drag
him
from
his
horse
,
and
in
spite
of
the
effort
of
his
man
,
whose
blow
fall
upon
me
thick
as
hail
,
and
quite
as
harmlessly
,
I
bear
him
through
the
garden
to
the
back
of
the
house
,
where
my
shout
soon
bring
Nicholas
and
other
to
my
assistance
,
and
after
deliver
my
captive
to
them
,
I
dismount
.
<EOS>
the
squire
,
you
will
imagine
,
be
astonish
to
see
me
,
and
greatly
applaud
my
prowess
.
<EOS>
I
reply
,
with
the
modesty
become
my
assume
character
,
that
I
have
do
nothing
,
and
,
in
reality
,
the
feat
be
nothing
to
me
;
but
I
tell
him
I
have
something
of
the
utmost
importance
to
communicate
,
and
which
could
not
be
delay
a
moment
;
whereupon
he
lead
me
to
a
small
room
adjoin
the
hall
,
while
the
crestfallen
knight
be
leave
to
vent
his
rage
and
mortification
on
the
groom
to
whose
custody
he
be
commit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
act
your
part
to
perfection
,
"
say
Mistress
Nutter
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
trust
my
sweet
Fancy
for
that
,
"
say
the
hag--"there
be
no
familiar
like
him
--
none
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
praise
make
me
blush
,
"
rejoin
fancy
.
"
<EOS>
but
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
I
fulfil
your
instruction
to
the
letter
,
and
excited
Nicholas
's
horror
and
indignation
by
the
tale
I
tell
him
.
<EOS>
I
laugh
in
my
sleeve
all
the
while
,
but
I
maintain
a
very
different
countenance
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
think
me
full
of
anguish
and
despair
.
<EOS>
He
question
me
as
to
my
proceeding
at
Malkin
Tower
,
and
I
amaze
him
with
the
description
of
a
fearful
storm
I
have
encounter
--
of
my
interview
with
old
Demdike
,
and
her
atrocious
treatment
of
Alizon
--
to
all
of
which
he
listen
with
profound
interest
.
<EOS>
Richard
himself
could
not
have
move
him
more
--
perhaps
not
so
much
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
have
finish
,
he
vow
he
would
rescue
Alizon
from
the
murtherous
hag
,
and
prevent
the
latter
from
commit
further
mischief
;
and
bid
me
come
with
him
,
we
repair
to
the
room
in
which
Nowell
and
Potts
be
confine
.
<EOS>
We
find
them
both
fast
asleep
in
their
chair
;
but
Nicholas
quickly
awaken
them
,
and
some
explanation
ensue
,
which
do
not
at
first
appear
very
clear
and
satisfactory
to
either
magistrate
or
attorney
,
but
in
the
end
they
agree
to
accompany
us
on
the
expedition
,
Master
Potts
declare
it
would
compensate
him
for
all
his
mischance
if
he
could
arrest
Mother
Demdike
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
may
have
his
wish
,
"
say
Mother
Chattox
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
but
he
declare
that
his
next
step
should
be
to
arrest
you

mistress

observe
Fancy

with
a
laugh

<EOS>
the
first
part

a

"
<EOS>
yonder
they
go
,
to
the
back
of
the
beacon

"
 
<EOS>
cast
a
look
at
the
wretched
speaker
,
and
find
she
be
too
grievously
wound
to
be
able
to
move
,
Nicholas
bestow
no
further
think
upon
her
,
but
set
off
with
his
companion
in
the
direction
point
out
.
<EOS>
He
speedily
arrive
at
the
edge
of
the
hill
,
and
,
look
down
it
,
seek
in
vain
for
any
appearance
of
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
the
side
be
here
steep
and
shelve
,
and
some
hundred
yard
low
down
be
break
into
ridge
,
behind
one
of
which
it
be
possible
the
old
witch
and
her
grandson
may
be
conceal
;
so
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
the
squire
descend
,
and
begin
to
search
about
in
the
hollow
,
scramble
over
the
loose
stone
,
or
slide
down
for
some
pace
with
the
uncertain
boggy
soil
,
when
he
fancy
he
hear
a
plaintive
cry
.
<EOS>
He
look
around
,
but
could
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
the
whole
side
of
the
mountain
be
light
up
by
the
fire
from
the
beacon
,
which
,
instead
of
diminish
,
burn
with
increase
ardour
,
so
that
every
object
be
as
easily
to
be
discern
as
in
the
day
-
time
;
but
,
notwithstanding
this
,
he
could
not
detect
whence
the
sound
proceed
.
<EOS>
It
be
repeat
,
but
more
faintly
than
before
,
and
Nicholas
almost
persuade
himself
it
be
the
voice
of
Potts
call
for
help
.
<EOS>
motion
to
his
follower
,
who
be
engage
in
the
search
like
himself
,
to
keep
still
,
the
squire
listen
intently
,
and
again
catch
the
sound
,
be
this
time
convince
it
arise
from
the
ground
.
<EOS>
be
it
possible
the
unfortunate
attorney
have
be
bury
alive
?
<EOS>
or
have
he
be
thrust
into
some
hole
,
and
a
stone
place
over
it
,
which
he
find
it
impossible
to
remove
?
<EOS>
the
latter
idea
seem
the
more
probable
,
and
Nicholas
be
guide
by
a
feeble
repetition
of
the
noise
towards
a
large
fragment
of
rock
,
which
,
on
examination
,
have
evidently
be
roll
from
a
point
immediately
over
the
mouth
of
a
hollow
.
<EOS>
the
squire
instantly
set
himself
to
work
to
dislodge
the
ponderous
stone
,
and
,
aid
by
two
of
his
man
,
who
lend
their
broad
shoulder
to
the
task
,
quickly
accomplish
his
object
,
disclose
what
appear
to
be
the
mouth
of
a
cavernous
recess
.
<EOS>
from
out
of
this
,
as
soon
as
the
stone
be
remove
,
pop
the
head
of
Master
Potts
,
and
Nicholas
,
bid
him
be
of
good
cheer
,
lay
hold
of
him
to
draw
him
forth
,
as
he
seem
to
have
some
difficulty
in
extricate
himself
,
when
the
attorney
cry
out--

hard

Nicholas

effort

him

pull
down
into

<EOS>
the
squire
be
at
a
loss
what
to
do
,

be
consider
whether
he
should
resort
to
the
tedious
process
of
dig
him
out
,
when
a
scramble
noise
be

the
captive
's
head
once
more
appear
above

Nicholas

CHAPTER
I.--DOWNHAM
MANOR
-
HOUSE
.
  
<EOS>
on
a
lovely
morning
,
about
the
middle
of
July
,
in
the
same
year
as
the
event
previously
narrate
,
Nicholas
Assheton
,
always
astir
with
the
lark
,
issue
from
his
own
dwelling
,
and
saunter
across
the
smooth
lawn
in
front
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
green
eminence
on
which
he
stand
be
shelter
on
the
right
by
a
grove
of
sycamore
,
form
the
boundary
of
the
park
,
and
slope
down
into
a
valley
thread
by
a
small
clear
stream
,
whose
murmuring
,
as
it
dance
over
its
pebbly
bed
,
distinctly
reach
his
ear
in
the
stillness
of
early
day
.
<EOS>
on
the
left
,
partly
in
the
valley
,
and
partly
on
the
side
of
the
acclivity
on
which
the
hall
be
situate
,
nestle
the
little
village
whose
inhabitant
own
Nicholas
as
lord
;
and
,
to
judge
from
their
habitation
,
they
have
reason
to
rejoice
in
their
master
;
for
certainly
there
be
a
cheerful
air
about
Downham
which
the
neighbouring
hamlet
,
especially
those
in
Pendle
Forest
,
sadly
want
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
left
of
the
mansion
,
and
only
separate
from
it
by
the
garden
wall
,
stand
the
church
,
a
venerable
structure
,
date
back
to
a
period
more
remote
even
than
Whalley
Abbey
.
<EOS>
from
the
churchyard
a
view
,
almost
similar
to
that
enjoy
by
the
squire
,
be
obtain
,
though
partially
interrupt
by
the
thick
rounded
foliage
of
a
large
tree
grow
beneath
it
;
and
many
a
traveller
who
come
that
way
linger
within
the
hallowed
precinct
to
contemplate
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
be
a
small
stone
bridge
cross
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
across
the
road
,
and
scarce
thirty
pace
from
the
church
-
gate
,
stand
a
little
alehouse
,
whose
comfortable
fireside
nook
and
good
liquor
be
not
disdain
by
the
squire
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
to
his
shame
be
it
speak
,
he
be
quite
as
often
to
be
find
there
of
an
evening
as
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
this
have
more
particularly
be
the
case
since
the
house
be
tenant
by
Richard
Baldwyn
,
who
have
give
up
the
mill
at
Rough
Lee
,
and
take
to
wife
Bess
Whitaker
of
Goldshaw
Booth
,
have
remove
with
her
to
Downham
,
where
he
now
flourish
under
the
special
protection
of
the
squire
.
<EOS>
Bess
have
lose
none
of
her
old
habit
of
command
,
and
it
must
be
confess
that
poor
Richard
play
a
very
secondary
part
in
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
be
permit
considerable
licence
by
her
,
but
even
he
have
limit
,
which
she
take
good
care
he
should
not
exceed
.
 
<EOS>
the
Downham
domain
be
well
cultivate
;
the
line
of
demarcation
between
them
and
the
heathy
waste
adjoin
,
be
clearly
trace
out
,
and
you
have
only
to
follow
the
course
of
the
brook
to
see
at
a
glance
where
the
purlieu
of
the
forest
end
,
and
where
Nicholas
Assheton
's
property
commence
:
the
one
be
a
dreary
moor
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
thicket
upon
it
,
but
more
frequently
a
dangerous
morass
,
cover
with
sulphur
-
colour
mos
;
and
the
other
consisting
of
green
meadow
,
border
in
most
instance
by
magnificent
timber
.
<EOS>
the
contrast
,
however
,
be
not
without
its
charm
;
and
while
the
sterile
waste
set
off
the
fair
and
fertile
field
around
them
,
and
enhance
their
beauty
,
they
offer
a
wide
,
uninterrupted
expanse
,
over
which
the
eye
could
range
at
will
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
further
side
of
the
valley
,
and
immediately
opposite
the
lawn
whereon
<EOS>
Nicholas
stand
,
the
ground
gradually
arise
,
until
it
reach
the
foot
of
Pendle
Hill
,
which
here
assume
its
most
majestic
aspect
,
constitute
the
grand
and
peculiar
feature
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
nowhere
could
the
lordly
eminence
be
see
to
the
same
advantage
as
from
this
point
,
and
Nicholas
contemplate
it
with
feeling
of
rapture
,
which
no
familiarity
could
diminish
.
<EOS>
the
sun
shine
brightly
upon
its
rounded
summit
,
and
upon
its
seamy
side
,
reveal
all
its
rift
and
ridge
;
add
depth
of
tint
to
its
dusky
soil
,
lay
bare
in
place
by
the
winter
torrent
;
lend
new
beauty
to
its
purple
heath
,
and
make
its
grey
sod
glow
as
with
fire
.
<EOS>
so
exhilarating
be
the
prospect
,
that
Nicholas
feel
half
tempt
to
cross
the
valley
and
scale
the
hill
before
break
his
fast
;
but
other
feeling
check
him
,
and
he
turn
towards
the
right
.
<EOS>
here
,
beyond
a
paddock
and
some
outbuilding
,
lie
the
park
,
small
in
extent
,
but
beautifully
diversify
,
<EOS>
well
stock
with
deer
,
and
boast
much
noble
timber
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
be
an
exquisite
knoll
,
which
,
besides
command
a
fine
view
of
Pendle
Hill
,
Downham
,
and
all
the
adjacent
country
,
bring
within
its
scope
,
on
the
one
hand
,
the
ancient
castle
of
Clithero
and
the
height
overlook
Whalley
;
and
,
on
the
other
,
the
lovely
and
extensive
vale
through
which
the
Ribble
wander
.
<EOS>
this
,
also
,
be
a
favourite
point
of
view
with
the
squire
,
and
he
have
some
idea
of
walk
towards
it
,
when
he
be
arrest
by
a
person
who
come
from
the
house
,
and
who
shout
to
him
,
hoarsely
but
blithely
,
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
the
new
-
comer
be
a
man
of
middle
age
,
with
a
skin
almost
as
tawny
as
a
gipsy
's
,
a
hooked
nose
,
black
beetling
brow
,
and
eye
so
strangely
set
in
his
head
,
that
they
communicate
a
sinister
expression
to
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
possess
a
burly
frame
,
square
,
and
somewhat
heavy
,
though
not
so
much
so
as
to
impede
his
activity
.
<EOS>
in
deportment
and
stature
,
though
not
in
feature
,
he
resemble
the
squire
himself
;
and
the
likeness
be
heighten
by
his
habiliment
be
part
of
Nicholas
's
old
wardrobe
,
the
doublet
and
hose
,
and
even
the
green
hat
and
boot
,
be
those
in
which
Nicholas
make
his
first
appearance
in
this
history
.
<EOS>
the
personage
who
thus
condescend
to
be
feed
and
clothe
at
the
squire
's
expense
,
and
who
fill
a
situation
something
between
guest
and
menial
,
without
receive
the
precise
attention
of
the
one
or
the
wage
of
the
other
,
but
who
make
himself
so
useful
to
Nicholas
that
he
could
not
dispense
with
him
--
neither
,
perhaps
would
he
have
be
shake
off
,
even
if
it
have
be
desire
--
be
name
Lawrence
Fogg
,
an
entire
stranger
to
the
country
,
whom
Nicholas
have
pick
up
at
Colne
,
and
whom
he
have
invite
to
Downham
for
a
few
week
'
hunting
,
and
have
never
be
able
to
get
rid
of
him
since
.
 
<EOS>
Lawrence
Fogg
like
his
quarter
immensely
,
and
determine
to
remain
in
them
;
and
as
a
means
to
so
desirable
an
end
,
he
study
all
the
squire
's
weak
point
and
peculiarity
,
and
these
not
be
very
difficult
to
be
understand
,
he
soon
master
them
,
and
master
the
squire
into
the
bargain
,
but
without
allow
his
success
to
become
manifest
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
be
delighted
to
find
one
with
taste
so
congenial
to
his
own
,
who
be
so
willing
to
hunt
or
fish
with
him
--
who
could
train
a
hawk
as
well
as
Phil
Royle
,
the
falconer
--
<EOS>
diet
a
fighting
-
cock
as
well
as
Tom
Shaw
,
the
cock
-
master
--
enter
a
hound
better
than
Charlie
Crouch
,
the
old
huntsman
--
<EOS>
shoot
with
the
long
-
bow
further
than
any
one
except
himself
,
and
be
willing
to
toss
off
a
pot
with
him
,
or
sing
a
merry
stave
whenever
he
feel
inclined
.
<EOS>
such
a
companion
be
invaluable
,
and
Nicholas
congratulate
himself
upon
the
discovery
,
especially
when
he
find
Lawrence
Fogg
not
unwilling
to
undertake
some
delicate
commission
for
him
,
which
he
could
not
well
execute
himself
,
and
which
he
be
unwilling
should
reach
Mistress
Assheton
's
ear
.
<EOS>
these
be
manage
with
equal
adroitness
and
caution
.
<EOS>
about
the
same
time
,
too
,
Nicholas
find
money
scarce
,
and
,
not
like
to
borrow
it
in
person
,
delegate
Fogg
,
and
send
him
round
to
his
friend
to
ask
for
a
loan
;
but
,
in
this
instance
,
the
mission
be
attend
with
very
indifferent
success
,
for
not
one
of
them
would
lend
him
so
small
<EOS>
a
sum
as
thirty
pound
,
all
aver
they
stand
in
need
of
it
quite
as
much
as
himself
.
<EOS>
though
somewhat
inconvenienced
by
their
refusal
,
Nicholas
bear
the
disappointment
with
his
customary
equanimity
,
and
make
merry
with
his
friend
as
if
nothing
have
happen
.
<EOS>
Fogg
show
an
equal
accommodate
spirit
in
all
religious
observance
,
and
,
though
much
against
his
inclination
,
attend
morning
discourse
and
lecture
with
his
patron
,
and
even
make
an
attempt
at
psalm
-
singe
;
but
on
one
occasion
,
miss
the
tune
and
come
in
with
a
bacchanalian
chorus
,
he
be
severely
rebuke
by
the
minister
,
and
enjoin
to
keep
silence
in
future
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
friendly
relation
subsist
between
the
party
when
they
meet
together
on
the
lawn
on
the
morning
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Fogg
,
"
cry
Nicholas
,
after
exchange
salutation
with
his
friend
,
"
what
say
you
to
hunt
the
otter
in
the
Ribble
after
breakfast
?
'
<EOS>
tis
a
rare
day
for
the
sport
,
and
the
hound
be
in
excellent
order
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
dam
and
her
litter
whom
we
must
kill
,
for
she
have
be
play
the
very
devil
with
the
fish
for
a
space
of
more
than
two
mile
;
and
if
we
let
her
off
for
another
week
,
we
shall
have
neither
salmon
,
trout
,
nor
umber
,
as
all
will
have
pass
down
the
maw
of
her
voracious
brood
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
that
would
be
a
pity
,
in
good
sooth
,
squire
,
"
reply
Fogg
;
"
for
there
be
no
fish
like
those
of
the
Ribble
.
<EOS>
nothing
I
should
prefer
to
the
sport
you
promise
;
but
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
other
business
for
me
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
another
attempt
to
borrow
money
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
from
my
cousin
,
Dick
Assheton
,
"
rejoin
Nicholas
;
"
he
will
lend
me
the
thirty
pound
,
I
be
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
better
defer
the
visit
till
to
-
morrow
,
when
his
father
,
Sir
Richard
,
will
be
at
Whalley
,
and
when
you
can
have
him
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
Dick
will
not
say
you
nay
,
depend
on't
;
he
be
too
good
a
fellow
for
that
.
<EOS>
a
murrain
on
those
close
-
fisted
curmudgeon
,
Roger
Nowell
,
Nicholas
Townley
,
and
Tom
Whitaker
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
be
delighted
to
oblige
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
they
declare
they
have
no
money
,
"
say
Fogg
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
money!--pshaw
!
"
exclaim
Nicholas
;
"
an
idle
excuse
.
<EOS>
They
have
chest
full

<EOS>
Would
I
have
all
Roger
Nowell
's
gold
,
I
should
not
require
another
supply
for
year
.
<EOS>
but
,
'
sdeath
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
trouble
myself
for
a
paltry
thirty
pound
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
may
venture
to
suggest
,
squire
,
while
you
be
about
it
,
I
would
ask
for
a
hundred
pound
,
or
even
two
or
three
hundred
,
"
say
Fogg
.
<EOS>
"
Your
friend
will
think
all
the
well
of
you
,
and
feel
more
satisfied
you
intend
to
repay
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
so
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Nicholas
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
by
Plutus
,
it
shall
be
three
hundred
pound
--
three
hundred
at
interest
.
<EOS>
Dick
will
have
to
borrow
the
amount
to
lend
it
to
me
;
but
,
no
matter
,
he
will
easily
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
Harkye
,
Fogg
,
while
you
be
at
Middleton
,
endeavour
to
ascertain
whether
any
thing
have
be
arrange
about
the
marriage
of
a
certain
young
lady
to
a
certain
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
be
curious
to
know
the
precise
state
of
affair
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
arrive
at
the
truth
,
if
possible
,
squire
,
"
reply
Fogg
;
"
but
I
should
scarcely
think
Sir
Richard
would
assent
to
his
son
's
union
with
the
daughter
of
a
notorious
witch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Richard
's
son
be
scarcely
likely
to
ask
Sir
Richard
's
consent

Nicholas
;
"
and
as
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
though
heavy
charge
have
be
bring
against
her

nothing
have
be
prove

for
you
know

rather
be
rescue

on
her
way
to
Lancaster
Castle

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
fully
aware
of
it
,
squire
,

<EOS>
reply
Fogg
;
"
and
I
more
than
suspect
a
worthy
friend
of
mine
have
a
hand
in
her
deliverance

could
tell
where
to
find
her
if
needful

<EOS>
but
that
be
neither
here

there

<EOS>
the
lady
be
quite
innocent
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
quite
sure
of
it
,
since
you
espouse
her
cause
so
warmly
.
<EOS>
but
the
world
be
malicious
,
and
strange
thing
be
report
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
heed
not
the
world
,
Fogg
,
"
rejoin
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
world
speak
well
of
no
man
,
be
his
desert
what
they
may
.
<EOS>
the
world
say
that
I
waste
my
estate
in
wine
,
woman
,
and
horseflesh
--
that
I
spend
time
in
pleasure
which
may
be
profitably
employ
--
that
I
neglect
my
wife
,
forget
my
religious
observance
,
be
on
horseback
when
I
should
be
afoot
,
at
the
alehouse
when
I
should
be
at
home
,
at
a
marriage
when
I
should
be
at
a
funeral
,
shoot
when
I
should
be
keep
my
book
--
in
short
,
it
have
not
a
good
word
to
say
for
me
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
thee
,
Fogg
,
it
say
thou
art
an
idle
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
fellow
;
or
,
if
thou
art
good
for
aught
,
it
be
only
for

It

profanely

that
thou

let

<EOS>
a
fine
old
manorial
residence
be
Downham
,
and
beautifully
situate
,
as
have
be
show
,
on
a
woody
eminence
to
the
north
of
Pendle
Hill
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
great
antiquity
,
and
first
come
into
the
possession
of
the
Assheton
family
in
1558
.
<EOS>
considerable
addition
have
be
make
to
it
by
its
present
owner
,
Nicholas
,
and
the
outlay
necessarily
require
,
combine
with
his
lavish
expenditure
,
have
contribute
to
embarrass
him
.
<EOS>
the
stable
be
large
,
and
full
of
horse
;
the
kennel
on
the
same
scale
,
and
equally
well
supply
with
hound
;
and
there
be
a
princely
retinue
of
servant
in
the
yard
--
groom
,
keeper
,
falconer
,
huntsman
,
and
their
assistant
--
to
say
nothing
of
their
fellow
within
door
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
if
it
have
be
your
fortune
to
accompany
the
squire
and
his
friend
round
the
premise
--
if
you
have
walk
through
the
stable
and
count
the
horse
--
if
you
have
view
the
kennel
and
examine
the
various
hound
--
the
great
Lancashire
dog
,
tall
,
shaggy
,
and
heavy
,
a
race
now
extinct
;
the
Worcestershire
hound
,
then
also
in
much
repute
;
the
greyhound
,
the
harrier
,
the
beagle
,
the
lurcher
,
and
,
lastly
,
the
verminer
,
or
,
as
we
should
call
them
,
the
terriers,--if
you
have
see
all
these
,
you
would
not
have
wonder
that
money
be
scarce
with
him
.
<EOS>
still
further
would
your
surprise
at
such
a
consequence
have
diminish
if
you
have
go
on
to
the
falconry
,
and
see
on
the
perch
the
goshawk
and
her
tercel
,
the
sparrowhawk
and
her
musket
,
under
the
care
of
the
ostringer
;
and
further
on
the
falcon
-
gentle
,
the
gerfalcon
,
the
lanner
,
the
merlin
,
and
the
hobby
,
all
of
which
be
attend
to
by
the
head
falconer
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
do
you
good
to
hear
Nicholas
inquire
from
his
man
if
they
have
"
set
out
their
bird
that
morning
,
and
weather
them
;
"
if
they
have
mummy
powder
in
readiness
,
then
esteem
a
sovereign
remedy
;
if
the
lur
,
hood
,
jesse
,
buet
,
and
all
other
needful
furniture
,
be
in
good
order
;
and
if
the
meat
be
sweet
and
wholesome
.
<EOS>
You
may
next
have
follow
him
to
the
pen
where
the
fighting
cock
be
keep
,
and
where
you
would
have
find
another
source
of
expense
in
the
cock
-
master
,
Tom
Shaw
--
a
knave
who
not
only
get
high
wage
from
his
master
,
but
understand
so
well
the
dieting
of
his
bird
that
he
could
make
them
win
or
lose
a
battle
as
he
think
proper
.
<EOS>
here
,
again
,
Nicholas
have
much
to
say
,
and
be
in
rapture
with
one
cock
,
which
he
tell
Fogg
he
would
back
to
any
amount
,
utterly
unconscious
of
a
significant
look
that
pass
between
his

master

<EOS>
"

cry
the

;
"
how
proud
and
erect

<EOS>
His
head

as
small
as

large

quick

thick

his
leg
strong
in

here
the

<EOS>
the

,
happily

insensible
to
the
condition
of
the
chamber
,
and
look
around

with
an
air
of
satisfaction

with
a

such

<EOS>
already
have
it

remark
that

soon
after

eminence

where

sweep

open
upon

include
the
fine

the

all

the

tongue
keep
pace
with
his

briskly
along
;

as
they
enter
the
thicket
in
question

catch
sight
of

river
through
the
tree
,
the
old
huntsman
enjoin
silence
,
and
he
be
oblige
to
put
a
check
upon
his
loquacity
.
 
<EOS>
when
within
a
bowshot
from
the
water
,
the
party
come
to
a
halt
,
and
two
of
the
man
be
direct
by
Crouch
to
cross
the
stream
at

point

and
then
commence
beat
the
bank

while
the
other
two
be
order
to
pursue
a
like
course

but
to
keep
on
the
near
side
of
the
river

<EOS>
the
hound
be
next
uncoupled

and
the
man
set
off
to

the
order

afterwards
the
crashing
of
branch
,
and
the
splashing
of

,
accompany
by
the
deep
baying
of
the
hound

tell
they
be
at
work

<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Nicholas
and
the
other
have
not
remain
idle
.
<EOS>
as
the
varlet
strike
off
in
different
direction
,
they
go
straight
on
,
and
force
their
way
through
the
brushwood
,
come
to
a
high
bank
overlook
the
Ribble
,
on
<EOS>
the
top
of
which
grow
<EOS>
three

four
large

whose

place

<EOS>
receive
a
hint
from
Crouch
to
make
for
the
central
tree
,
Nicholas
grasp
his
spear
,
and
spring
forward
;
but
,
quick
as
he
be
,
he
be
too
late
,
though
he
see
enough
to
convince
him
that
the
crafty
old
huntsman
have
be
correct
in
his
judgment
;
for
a
dark
,
slimy
object
drop
from
out
the
root
of
the
tree
beneath
him
,
and
glide
into
the
water
as
swiftly
and
as
noiselessly
as
if
its
skin
have
be
oil
.
<EOS>
a
few
bubble
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
water
,
but
these
be
all
the
indication
mark
the
course
of
the
wondrous
diver
.
 
<EOS>
but
other
eye
,
sharp
than
those
of
Nicholas
,
be
on
the
watch
,
and
the
old
huntsman
shout
out
,
"
there
hoo
go
,
grip
--
efter
her
,
lad
,
efter
her
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
word
be
scarcely
utter
when
the
dog
spring
from
the
top
of
the
bank
and
sink
under
the
water
.
<EOS>
for
some
second
no
trace
could
be
observe
of
either
animal
,
and
then
the
shaggy
nose
of
the
lurcher
be
see
nearly
fifty
yard
high
up
the
river
,
and
after
sniff
around
for
a
moment
,
and
fix
his
single
eye
on
his
master
,
who
be
stand
on
the
bank
,
and
encourage
him
with
his
voice
and
gesture
,
he
dive
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Station

"

Yo

"
 
<EOS>
all
be
now
animation
and
excitement
.
<EOS>
perceive
from
the
noise
that
the
otter
have
be
find
,
the
four
varlet
hasten
towards
the
scene
of
action
,
and
,
by
their
shout
and
the
clatter
of
their
stave
,
contribute
greatly
to
its
spirit
.
<EOS>
two
be
on
one
side
of
the
stream
,
and
two
on
the
other
,
and
up
to
this
moment
the
hound
be
similarly
separate
;
but
now
most
of
them
have
take
to
the
water
,
some
swimming
about
,
other
stand
up
to
the
middle
in
the
shallow
part
of
the
current
,
watch
with
keen
gaze
for
the
appearance
of
their
anticipate
victim
.
 
<EOS>
have
descend
the
bank
,
Nicholas
have
so
place
himself
among
the
huge
twisted
root
of
the
tree
,
that
if
the
otter
,
alarm
by
the
presence
of
so
many
foe
,
and
unable
to
escape
either
up
or
down
the
river
,
should
return
to
her
couch
,
he
make
certain
of
strike
her
.
<EOS>
at
first
there
seem
little
chance
of
such
an
occurrence
,
for
Fogg
,
who
have
go
a
hundred
yard
high
up
,
suddenly
dash
into
the
stream
,
and
,
plunge
his
spear
into
the
mud
,
cry
out
that
he
have
hit
the
beast
;
but
the
next
moment
,
when
he
draw
the
weapon
forth
,
and
exhibit
a
large
rat
which
he
have
transfix
,
his
mistake
excite
much
merriment
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Crouch
,
meantime
,
do
not
suffer
his
attention
to
be
draw
from
his
dog
.
<EOS>
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
see
him
come
to
the
surface
to
breathe
,
but
as
he
keep
within
a
short
distance
,
though
rise
at
different
point
,
the
old
huntsman
feel
certain
the
otter
have
not
get
away
,
and
,
have
the
utmost
reliance
upon
Grip
's
perseverance
and
sagacity
<EOS>
,
he
feel
confident
he
would
bring
the
quarry
to
him
if
the
thing
be
possible
.
<EOS>
the
varlet
keep
up
an
incessant
clatter
,
beat
the
water
with
their
stave
,
and
cast
large
stone
into
it
,
while
the
hound
bay
furiously
,
so
that
the
poor
fugitive
be
turn
on
whichever
side
<EOS>
she
attempt
a
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
while
this
be
go
on
,
Nicholas
be
caution
by
the
huntsman
to
look
out
,
and
scarcely
have
the
admonition
reach
him
than
the
sleek
shine
body
of
the
otter
emerge
from
the
water
,
and
wreathe
itself
among
the
root
.
<EOS>
the
squire
instantly
deal
a
blow
which
he
expect
to
prove
fatal
,
but
his
mortification
be
excessive
when
he
find
he
have
drive
the
spear
-
head
so
deeply
into
the
tree
that
he
could
scarcely
disengage
it
,
while
an
almost
noiseless
plunge
tell
that
his
prey
have
escape
.
<EOS>
almost
at
the
same
moment
that
the
poor
hunt
beast
have
seek
its
old
lodging
,
the
untire
lurcher
have
appear
at
the
edge
of
the
bank
,
and
,
as
the
former
again
go
down
,
he
dive
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
secretly
laugh
at
the
squire
's
failure
,
the
old
huntsman
prepare
to
take
advantage
of
a
similar
opportunity
if
it
should
present
itself
,
and
with
this
view
ensconce
himself
behind
a
pollard
willow
,
which
stand
close
beside
the
stream
,
and
whence
he
could
watch
closely
all
that
pass
,
without
be
expose
to
view
.
<EOS>
the
prudence
of
the
step
be
soon
manifest
.
<EOS>
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
second
,
during
which
neither
dog
nor
otter
have
rise
to
breathe
,
a
slight
,
very
slight
,
undulation
be
perceptible
on
the
surface
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
Crouch
's
grasp
tighten
upon
his
staff
--
he
wait
another
moment
--
then
dash
forward
,
strike
down
his
spear
,
and
raise
it
aloft
,
with
the
poor
otter
transfix
and
writhe
upon
its
point
.
 
<EOS>
loudly
and
exultingly
do
the
old
man
shout
at
his
triumph
,
and
loudly
be
his
vociferation
answer
by
the
other
.
<EOS>
all
fly
to
the
spot
where
he
be
stand
,
and
the
hound
,
gather
round
him
,
yell
furiously
at
the
otter
,
and
show
every
disposition
to
tear
her
in
piece
,
if
they
could
get
at
her
.
<EOS>
kick
the
noisiest
and
fierce
of
them
out
of
the
way
,
Crouch
approach
the
river
's
brink
,
and
lower
the
spear
-
head
till
it
come
within
reach
of
his
favourite
Grip
,
who
have
not
yet
come
out
of
the
water
,
but
stand
within
his
depth
,
with
his
one
red
eye
fix
on
the
enemy
he
have
so
hotly
pursue
,
and
fully
expect
his
reward
.
<EOS>
It
now
come
;
his
sharp
tooth
instantly
meet
in
the
otter
's
throat
,
and
when
Crouch
swing
them
both
in
the
air
,
he
still
maintain
his
hold
,
show
how
well
he
deserve
his
name
,
nor
could
he
be
disengage
until
long
after
the
suffering
of
the
torture
animal
have
cease
.
 
<EOS>
to
say
that
Nicholas
be
neither
chagrin
at
his
ill
success
,
nor
jealous
of
the
old
huntsman
's
superior
skill
,
would
be
to
affirm
an
untruth
;
but
he
put
the
good
face
he
could
upon
the
matter
,
and
praise
Grip
very
highly
,
allege
that
the
whole
merit
of
the
hunt
rest
with
him
.
<EOS>
Old
Crouch
let
him
go
on
,
and
when
he
have
do
,
quietly
observe
that
the
otter
they
have
destroy
be
not
the
one
they
come
in
search
of
,
as
they
have
see
nothing
of
her
litter
;
and
that
,
most
likely
,
the
beast
that
have
do
so
much
mischief
have
her
lodging
in
the
hollow
tree
near
the
Swanside
Beck
,
as
describe
by
the
varlet
,
and
he
wish
to
know
whether
the
squire
would
like
to
go
and
hunt
her
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
reply
that
he
be
quite
willing
to
do
so
,
and
hope
he
should
have
well
luck
on
the
second
occasion
;
and
with
this
they
set
forward
again
,
take
their
way
along
the
side
of
the
stream
,
beat
the
bank
as
they
go
,
but
without
rouse
any
thing
beyond
an
occasional
water
-
rat
,
which
be
kill
almost
as
soon
as
find
by
Grip
.
 
<EOS>
somehow
or
other
,
without
any
one
be
aware
what
lead
to
it
the
conversation
fall
upon
the
two
old
witch
,
mother
Demdike
and
Chattox
,
and
the
strange
manner
in
which
their
career
have
terminate
on
the
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
--
if
,
indeed
it
could
be
say
to
have
terminate
,
when
their
spirit
be
report
to
haunt
the
spot
,
and
may
be
see
,
it
be
assert
,
at
midnight
,
flit
round
the
beacon
,
and
shriek
dismally
.
<EOS>
the
restless
shade
be
pursue
,
it
be
add
,
by
the
figure
of
a
monk
in
white
mouldering
robe
,
suppose
to
be
the
ghost
of
Paslew
.
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
understand
how
these
apparition
could
be
witness
,
since
no
one
,
even
for
a
reward
,
could
be
prevail
upon
to
ascend
Pendle
Hill
after
nightfall
;
but
the
shepherd
affirm
they
have
see
them
from
below
,
and
that
be
testimony
sufficient
to
shake
the
most
sceptical
.
<EOS>
one
singular
circumstance
be
mention
,
which
must
not
be
pass
by
without
notice
;
and
this
be
,
that
when
the
cinder
of
the
extinct
beacon
-
fire
come
to
be
examine
,
no
remain
whatever
of
the
two
hag
could
be
discover
,
though
the
ashe

carefully
sift
,
and
it
be
quite
certain
that
the
flame
have
expire
long
before
their
body
could
be
consume
.
<EOS>
the
explanation
attempt
for
this
marvel
be
,
that
Satan
have
carry
them
off
while
yet
live
,
to
finish
their
combustion
in
a
still
more
fiery
region
.
 
<EOS>
mention
of
Mother
Demdike
naturally
lead
to
her
grandson
,
Jem
Device
,
who
,
have
escape
in
a
remarkable
manner
on
the
night
in
question
,
notwithstanding
the
hue
and
cry
make
after
him
,
have
not
,
as
yet
,
be
capture
,
though
he
have
be
occasionally
see
at
night
,
and
under
peculiar
circumstance
,
by
various
individual
,
and
amongst
other
by
old
Crouch
,
who
,
however
,
declare
he
have
be
unable
to
lay
hand
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
allusion
be
then
make
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
whereupon
it
be
observe
that
the
squire
change
the
conversation
quickly
;
while
sundry
sly
winks
and
shrug
be
exchange
among
the
varlet
of
the
kennel
,
seem
to
intimate
that
they
know
more
about
the
matter
than
they
care
to
admit
.
<EOS>
nothing
more
,
however
,
be
elicit
than
that
the
escort
conduct
her
to
Lancaster
Castle
,
together
with
the
other
witch
,
after
their
examination
before
the
magistrate
at
Whalley
,
and
committal
,
have
be
attack
,
while
it
be
pass
through
a
woody
defile
in
Bowland
Forest
,
by
a
party
of
man
in
the
garb
of
forester
,
and
the
lady
set
free
.
<EOS>
nor
have
she
be
hear
of
since
.
<EOS>
what
make
this
rescue
the
more
extraordinary
be
,
that
none
of
the
other
witch
be
liberate
at
the
same
time
,
but
some
of
them
who
seem
disposed
to
take
advantage
of
the
favourable
interposition
,
and
endeavour
to
get
away
,
be
bring
back
by
the
forester
to
the
officer
of
justice
;
thus
clearly
prove
that
the
attempt
be
solely
make
on
Mistress
Nutter
's
account
,
and
must
have
be
undertake
by
her
friend
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
it
be
assert
,
could
equal
the
rage
and
mortification
of
Roger
Nowell
and
Potts
,
on
learn
that
their
chief
prey
have
thus
escape
them
;
and
by
their
direction
,
for
more
than
a
week
,
the
strict
search
be
make
for
the
fugitive
throughout
the
neighbourhood
,
but
without
effect
--
no
clue
could
be
discover
to
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
suspicion
naturally
fall
upon
the
two
assheton
,
Nicholas
and
Richard
,
and
Roger
Nowell
roundly
tax
them
with
contrive
and
execute
the
enterprise
in
person
;
while
Potts
tell
them
they
be
guilty
of
misprision
of
felony
,
and
threaten
them
with
imprisonment
for
life
,
forfeiture
of
good
and
of
rent
,
for
the
offence
;
but
as
the
charge
could
not
be
prove
against
them
,
notwithstanding
all
the
effort
of
the
magistrate
and
attorney
,
it
fall
to
the
ground
;
and
Master
Potts
,
full
of
chagrin
at
this
unexpected
and
vexatious
termination
of
the
affair
,
return
to
London
,
and
settle
himself
in
his
chamber
in
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>
His
duty
,
however
,
as
clerk
of
the
court
,
would
necessarily
call
him
to
Lancaster
in
August
,
when
the
assizes
commence
,
and
when
he
would
assist
at
the
trial
of
such
of
the
witch
as
be
still
in
durance
.
 
<EOS>
from
Mother
Demdike
it
be
natural
that
the
conversation
should
turn
to
her
weird
retreat
,
Malkin
Tower
;
and
Richard
Sherborne
express
his
surprise
that
the
unhallowed
structure
should
be
suffer
to
remain
stand
after
her
removal
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
say
he
be
equally
anxious
with
his
brother
-
in
-
law
for
its
demolition
,
but
it
be
not
so
easily
to
be
accomplish
as
it
may
appear
;
for
the
deserted
structure
be
in
such
ill
repute
with
the
common
folk
,
as
well
as
every
one
else
,
that
no
one
dare
approach
it
,
even
in
the
daytime
.
<EOS>
a
boggart
,
it
be
say
,
have
take
possession
of
its
vault
,
and
scare
away
all
who
venture
near
it
;
sometimes
show
himself
in
one
frightful
shape
,
and
sometimes
in
another
;
now
as
a
monstrous
goat
,
now
as
an
equally
monstrous
cat
,
utter
fearful
cry
,
glare
with
fiery
eye
from
out
of
the
window
,
or
appear
in
all
his
terror
on
the
summit
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
the
haunt
structure
be
frequently
light
up
at
dead
of
night
,
strain
of
unearthly
music
be
hear
resound
from
it
,
and
wild
figure
be
see
flit
past
the
window
,
as
if
engage
in
dancing
and
revelry
;
so
that
it
appear
that
no
alteration
for
the
well
have
take
place
there
,
and
that
thing
be
still
quite
as
improperly
conduct
now
,
as
they
have
be
in
the
time
of
Mother
Demdike
,
or
in
those
of
her
predecessor
,
Isole
de
Heton
and
Blackburn
,
the
robber
.
<EOS>
the
common
opinion
be
,
that
Satan
and
all
his
imp
have
take
up
their
abode
in
the
tower
,
and
,
as
they
like
their
quarter
,
lead
a
jolly
life
there
,
dance
and
drink
all
night
long
,
it
would
be
useless
at
present
to
give
them
notice
to
quit
,
still
less
to
attempt
to
pull
down
the
house
about
their
ear
.
<EOS>
Richard
Sherborne
hear
this
wondrous
relation
in
silence
,
but
with
a
look
of
incredulity
;
and
when
it
be
do
he
wink
slily
at
his
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
a
strange
expression
,
half
comical
,
half
suspicious
,
may
also
have
be
observe
on
Fogg
's
countenance
;
and
he
narrowly
watch
the
squire
as
the
latter
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
with
the
disappearance
of
the
malignant
old
hag
who
have
so
long
infest
the
neighbourhood
,
have
all
mischief
and
calamity
cease
,
or
be
people
as
much
afflict
as
heretofore
?
<EOS>
be
there
,
in
short
,
so
many
case
of
witchcraft
,
real
or
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
question
next
address
by
Sherborne
to
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
the
squire
answer
decidedly
there
be
not
.
<EOS>
since
the
burning
of
the
two
old
beldame
,
and
the
imprisonment
of
the
other
,
the
whole
district
of
Pendle
have
improve
.
<EOS>
all
those
who
have
be
smite
with
strange
illness
have
recover
;
and
the
inhabitant
of
the
little
village
of
Sabden
,
who
have
experience
the
full
effect
of
their
malignity
,
be
entirely
free
from
sickness
.
<EOS>
and
not
only
have
they
and
their
family
suddenly
regain
health
and
strength
,
but
all
belong
to
them
have
undergo
a
similar
beneficial
change
.
<EOS>
the
kine
that
have
lose
their
milk
now
yield
it
abundantly
;
the
lame
horse
halt
no
longer
;
the
murrain
cease
among
the
sheep
;
the
pig
that
have
grow
lean
amidst
abundance
fatten
rapidly
;
and
though
the
farrow
that
have
perish
during
the
evil
ascendency
of
the
witch
could
not
be
bring
back
again
,
their
place
promise
speedily
to
be
supply
by
other
.
<EOS>
the
corn
blight
early
in
the
year
have
spring
forth
anew
,
and
the
tree
nip
in
the
bud
be
laden
with
fruit
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
all
be
as
fair
and
as
flourishing
as
it
have
recently
be
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
amongst
other
,
John
Law
,
the
pedlar
,
who
have
be
deprive
of
the
use
of
his
limb
by
the
damnable
art
of
Mother
Demdike
,
have
marvellously
recover
on
the
very
night
of
her
destruction
,
and
be
now
as
strong
and
as
active
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"
such
happy
result
have
follow
the
removal
of
the
witch
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
"
Sherborne
say
,
"
that
the
riddance
would
be
complete
,
and
that
none
of
the
obnoxious
brood
would
be
leave
to
inflict
future
misery
on
their
fellow
.
<EOS>
this
could
not
be
the
case
so
long
as
James
Device
be
allow
to
go
at
large
;
nor
while
his
mother
,
Elizabeth
Device
,
a
notorious
witch
,
be
suffer
to
escape
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
Jennet
,
Elizabeth
's
daughter
,
a
mischievous
and
ill
-
favour
little
creature
,
who
inherit
all
the
ill
quality
of
her
parent
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
spawn
of
the
old
snake
,
and
,
until
they
be
entirely
exterminate
,
there
could
be
no
security
against
a
recurrence
of
the
evil
.
<EOS>
again
,
there
be
Nance
Redferne
,
old
Chattox
's
grand
-
daughter
,
a
comely
woman
enough
,
but
a
reputed
witch
,
and
an
undoubted
fabricator
of
clay
image
.
<EOS>
She
be
still
at
liberty
,
though
she
ought
to
be
with
the
rest
in
the
dungeon
of
Lancaster
Castle
.
<EOS>
It
be
useless
to
allege
that
with
the
destruction
of
the
old
hag
all
danger
have
cease
.
<EOS>
common
prudence
would
keep
the
other
quiet
now
;
but
the
moment
the
storm
pass
over
,
they
would
resume
their
atrocious
practice
,
and
all
would
be
as
bad
as
ever
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
the
tree
must
be
utterly
uprooted
,
or
it
would
inevitably
burst
forth
anew
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
these
opinion
Nicholas
generally
concur
;
but
he
express
some
sympathy
for
Nance
Redferne
,
whom
he
think
far
too
good
-
look
to
be
as
wicked
and
malicious
as
represent
.
<EOS>
but
however
that
may
be
,
and
however
much
he
may
desire
to
get
rid
of
the
family
of
the
Devices
<EOS>
,
he
fear
such
a
step
may
be
attend
with
danger
to
Alizon
,
and
that
she
may
in
some
way
or
other
be
implicate
with
them
.
<EOS>
this
last
remark
he
address
in
an
under
-
tone
to
his
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Sherborne
do
not
at
first
feel
any
apprehension
on
that
score
,
but
,
on
reflection
,
he
admit
that
Nicholas
be
perhaps
right
;
and
though
Alizon
be
now
the
recognise
daughter
of
Mistress
Nutter
,
yet
her
long
and
intimate
connection
with
the
Device
family
may
operate
to
her
prejudice
,
while
her
near
relationship
to
an
avow
witch
would
not
tend
to
remove
the
unfavourable
impression
.
<EOS>
Sherborne
then
go
on
to
speak
in
the
most
rapturous
term
of
the
beauty
and
goodness
of
the
young
girl
who
form
the
subject
of
their
conversation
,
and
declare
he
be
not
in
the
least
surprised
that
Richard
Assheton
be
so
much
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
he
add
,
a
most
extraordinary
change
have
take
place
in
her
since
the
dreadful
night
on
Pendle
Hill
,
when
her
mother
's
guilt
have
be
proclaim
,
and
when
her
arrest
have
take
place
as
an
offender
of
the
dark
dye
.
<EOS>
Alizon
,
he
say
,
have
lose
none
of
her
beauty
,
but
her
light
and
joyous
expression
of
countenance
have
be
supplant
by
a
look
of
profound
sadness
,
which
nothing
could
remove
.
<EOS>
Gentle
and
meek
in
her
deportment
<EOS>
,
she
seem
to
look
upon
herself
as
under
a
ban
,
and
as
if
she
be
unfit
to
associate
with
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
in
vain
Richard
Assheton
and
his
sister
endeavour
to
remove
this
impression
by
the
tender
assiduity
;
in
vain
they
seek
to
induce
her
to
enter
into
amusement
consistent
with
her
year
;
she
decline
all
society
but
their
own
,
and
pass
the
great
part
of
her
time
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
Sherborne
have
see
her
so
engage
,
and
the
expression
of
her
countenance
,
he
declare
,
be
seraphic
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
extreme
verge
of
a
high
bank
situate
at
the
point
of
junction
between
Swanside
Beck
and
the
Ribble
,
stand
an
old
,
decayed
oak
.
<EOS>
little
of
the
once
mighty
tree
beyond
the
gnarled
trunk
be
leave
,
and
this
be
completely
hollow
;
while
there
be
a
great
rift
near
the
bottom
through
which
a
man
may
easily
creep
,
and
,
when
once
in
,
stand
erect
without
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
beneath
the
bank
the
river
be
deep
and
still
,
form
a
pool
,
where
the
large
and
fat
fish
be
to
be
meet
with
.
<EOS>
in
addition
to
this
,
the
spot
be
extremely
secluded
,
be
rarely
visit
by
the
angler
on
account
of
the
thick
copse
by
which
it
be
surround
and
which
extend
along
the
back
,
from
the
point
of
confluence
between
the
less
and
the
large
stream
,
to
Downham
mill
,
nearly
half
a
mile
distant
.
 
<EOS>
the
side
of
the
Ribble
be
here
,
as
elsewhere
,
beautifully
woode
,
and
as
the
clear
stream
wind
along
through
bank
of
every
diversity
of
shape
and
character
,
and
cover
by
forest
tree
of
every
description
,
and
of
the
most
luxuriant
growth
,
the
effect
be
enchanting
;
the
more
so
,
that
the
sun
,
have
now
rise
high
in
the
heavens
,
pour
down
a
flood
of
summer
heat
and
radiance
,
that
render
these
cool
shade
inexpressibly
delightful
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
be
it
,
as
the
huntsman
leap
from
stone
to
stone
,
to
listen
to
the
sound
of
the
water
rush
past
them
.
<EOS>
pleasant
as
they
spring
upon
some
green
holm
or
fairy
islet
,
stand
in
the
midst
of
the
stream
,
and
divide
its
lucid
water
,
to
suffer
the
eye
to
follow
the
course
of
the
rapid
current
,
and
to
see
it
here
sparkle
in
the
bright
sunshine
,
there
plunge
in
shade
by
the
overhang
tree
--
now
fringe
with
osier
and
rush
,
now
embank
with
smooth
sward
of
emerald
green
;
<EOS>
anon
defend
by
steep
rock
,
sometimes
bold
and
bare
,
but
more
frequently
clothe
with
timber
;
then
sink
down
by
one
of
those
sudden
but
exquisite
transition
,
which
nature
alone
dare
display
,
from
this
savage
and
sombre
character
into
the
soft
and
gentle
expression
;
every
where
varied
,
yet
every
where
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
through
such
scene
of
silvan
loveliness
have
the
huntsman
pass
on
their
way
to
the
hollow
oak
,
and
they
have
ample
leisure
to
enjoy
them
,
because
the
squire
and
his
brother
-
in
-
law
be
engage
in
conversation
,
as
before
relate
,
make
frequent
pause
,
and
,
during
these
,
the
other
halt
likewise
;
and
even
the
hound
,
glad
of
a
respite
,
stand
still
,
or
amuse
themselves
by
splash
about
amid
the
shallow
without
any
definite
object
unless
of
cool
themselves
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
the
leader
once
more
move
forward
,
arise
the
cheering
shout
,
the
loud
deep
bay
,
the
clattering
of
stave
,
the
crashing
of
branch
,
and
all
the
other
inspirit
noise
accompany
the
progress
of
the
hunt
.
<EOS>
but
for
some
minute
these
have
again
cease
,
and
as
Nicholas
and
Sherborne
linger
beneath
the
shade
of
a
wide
-
spread
beech
-
tree
grow
on
a
sandy
hillock
near
the
stream
,
and
seem
deeply
interested
in
their
talk
--
as
well
they
may
,
for
it
related
to
Alizon
--
the
whole
troop
,
include
Fogg
,
hold
respectfully
aloof
,
and
await
their
pleasure
to
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
the
signal
to
move
be
,
at
length
,
give
by
the
squire
,
who
see
they
be
now
not
more
than
a
hundred
yard
from
the
bank
on
which
stand
the
hollow
tree
they
be
anxious
to
reach
.
<EOS>
as
the
river
here
make
a
turn
,
and
sweep
round
the
point
in
question
,
form
,
owe
to
this
detention
,
the
deep
pool
previously
mention
,
the
bank
almost
face
them
,
and
,
as
nothing
intervene
,
they
could
almost
look
into
the
rift
near
the
base
of
the
tree
,
form
<EOS>
,
they
suppose
,
the
entrance
to
the
otter
's
couch
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
this
be
easily
distinguished
,
no
trace
of
the
predatory
animal
could
be
see
;
and
though
many
sharp
eye
be
fix
upon
the
spot
during
the
prolonged
discourse
of
the
two
gentleman
,
nothing
have
occur
to
attract
their
attention
,
and
to
prove
that
the
object
of
their
quest
be
really
there
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
little
consultation
between
the
squire
and
Crouch
,
it
be
agree
that
the
former
should
alone
force
his
way
to
the
tree
,
while
the
other
be
to
station
themselves
with
the
hound
at
various
point
of
the
stream
,
above
and
below
the
bank
,
so
that
,
if
the
otter
and
her
litter
escape
their
first
assailant
,
they
should
infallibly
perish
by
the
hand
of
some
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
this
being
agree
upon
,
the
plan
be
instantly
put
into
execution
--
two
of
the
varlet
remain
where
they
be
--
two
go
high
up
;
while
Sherborne
and
Fogg
station
themselves
on
great
stone
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
,
whence
they
could
command
all
around
them
,
and
Crouch
,
wade
on
with
Grip
,
plant
himself
at
the
entrance
of
Swanside
Beck
into
the
Ribble
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
squire
have
scale
the
bank
,
enter
the
thick
covert
encircling
it
,
and
,
not
without
some
damage
to
his
face
and
hand
from
the
numerous
thorn
and
bramble
grow
amongst
it
,
force
his
way
upwards
until
he
reach
the
bare
space
surround
the
hollow
tree
;
and
this
attain
,
his
first
business
be
to
ascertain
that
all
be
in
readiness
below
before
commence
the
attack
.
<EOS>
a
glance
show
him
on
one
side
old
Crouch
stand
up
to
his
middle
in
the
beck
,
grasp
his
long
otter
spear
,
and
with
Grip
beat
the
water
in
front
of
him
in
anxious
expectation
of
employment
;
and
in
front
Fogg
,
Sherborne
,
and
two
of
the
varlet
,
with
their
hound
so
disposed
that
they
could
immediately
advance
upon
the
otter
if
it
plunge
into
the
river
,
while
its
passage
up
or
down
would
be
stop
by
their
comrade
.
<EOS>
all
this
he
discern
at
a
glance
;
and
comprehend
from
a
sign
make
him
by
the
old
huntsman
that
he
should
not
delay
<EOS>
,
he
advance
towards
the
tree
,
and
be
about
to
plunge
his
spear
into
the
hole
,
hope
to
transfix
one
at
least
of
its
occupant
,
when
he
be
startle
by
hear
a
deep
voice
apparently
issue
from
the
hollow
of
the
timber
,
bid
him
"
beware
!
"
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
recoil
aghast
,
for
he
think
it
may
be
Hobthurst

the
demon
of
the
wood
,
who
thus
bespeak
him
.
 
<EOS>

exclaim
the

,

for

the

<EOS>
"

I

exclaim
the
squire
;

they
marvellously

at

I
will
strike

<EOS>
"
an

"
retort
Jem
.
<EOS>
and
suddenly
spring
from
the
hole
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
,
he
pass
between
the
squire
's
leg
with
great
promptitude
,
and
fling
him
face
foremost
upon
the
ground
,
crawl
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
,
and
thence
drop
into
the
deep
pool
below
.
 
<EOS>
the
plunge
rouse
all
the
spectator
,
who
,
though
they
have
hear
what
have
pass
,
and
have
see
the
squire
upset
in
the
manner
describe
,
have
be
so
much
astounded
that
they
could
render
no
assistance
;
but
they
now
,
one
and
all
,
bestir
themselves
actively
to
seize
the
diver
when
he
should
rise
to
the
surface
.
<EOS>
but
though
every
eye
be
on
the
look
-
out
,
and
every
arm
raise
;
though
the
hound
be
as
eager
as
their
master
,
and
yell
fiercely
,
swam
round
the
pool
,
ready
to
pounce
upon
the
swimmer
as
upon
a
duck
,
all
be
disappoint
;
for
,
even
after
a
long
interval
than
their
patience
could
brook
,
he
do
not
appear
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
Nicholas
have
regain
his
leg
,
and
,
infuriate
by
his
discomfiture
,
approach
the
edge
of
the
bank
,
and
peer
down
below
,
hope
to
detect
the
fugitive
immediately
beneath
him
,
resolve
to
show
him
no
mercy
when
he
catch
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
equally
at
fault
with
the
other
,
and
after
more
than
five
minute
spend
in
ineffectual
search
,
he
order
Crouch
to
send
Grip
into
the
pool
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
keeper
reply
that
the
dog
be
not
use
to
this
kind
of
chase
,
and
may
not
display
his
usual
skill
in
it
;
but
as
the
squire
would
take
no
nay
,
he
be
oblige
to
consent
,
and
the
other
hound
be
call
off
lest
they
should
puzzle
him
.
<EOS>
twice
do
the
shrewd
lurcher
swim
round
the
pool
,
sniff
the
air
,
after
which
he
approach
the
shore
,
and
scent
close
to
the
bank
;
still
it
be
evident
he
could
detect
nothing
,
and
Nicholas
begin
to
despair
,
when
the
dog
suddenly
dive
.
<EOS>
expectation
be
then
raise
to
the
utmost
,
and
all
be
on
the
watch
again
,
Nicholas
lean
over
the
edge
of
the
bank
with
his
spear
in
hand
,
prepare
to
strike
;
but
the
dog
be
so
long
in
reappearing
,
that
all
have
give
him
up
for
lost
,
and
his
master
be
give
utterance
to
ejaculation
of
grief
and
rage
,
and
vow
vengeance
against
the
warlock
,
when
Grip
's
grisly
head
be
once
more
see
above
the
surface
of
the
water
,
and
this
time
he
have
a
piece
of
blue
serge
in
his
jaw
,
prove
that
he
have
have
hold
of
the
raiment
of
the
fugitive
,
and
that
therefore
the
latter
could
not
be
far
off
,
but
have
most
probably
get
into
some
hole
beneath
the
bank
.
 
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
this
notion
suggest
than
it
be
act
on
by
the
old
huntsman
and
Fogg
,
and
,
wade
forward
,
they
prick
the
bank
with
their
spear
at
various
point
below
the
level
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
Fogg
fall
forward
.
<EOS>
His
spear
have
enter
a
hole
,
and
have
penetrate
so
deeply
that
he
have
lose
his
balance
.
<EOS>
but
though
,
souse
over
head
and
ear
,
he
have
make
a
successful
hit
,
for
the
next
moment
Jem
Device
appear
above
the
water
,
and
ere
he
could
dive
again
his
throat
be
seize
by
Grip
,
and
while
struggle
to
free
himself
from
the
fang
of
the
tenacious
animal
,
he
be
lay
hold
of
by
Crouch
,
and
the
varlet
rush
forward
to
the
latter
's
assistance
,
the
ruffian
be
capture
.
 
<EOS>
some
difficulty
be
experience
in
rescue
the
captive
from
the
jaw
of
the
hound
,
who
,
infuriate
by
his
struggle
,
and
perhaps
mistake
him
for
some
strange
beast
of
chase
,
make
their
sharp
tooth
meet
in
various
part
of
his
person
,
rend
his
garment
from
his
limb
,
and
would
no
doubt
have
rend
the
flesh
also
,
if
they
have
be
permit
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
after
much
fighting
and
struggle
,
mingle
with
yell
and
vociferation
,
Jem
be
bear
ashore
,
and
fling
on
the
ground
,
where
he
present
a
wretched
spectacle
;
bleeding
,
half
-
drowned
,
and
cover
with
slime
acquire
during
his
occupation
of
the
hole
in
the
bank
.
<EOS>
but
though
unable
to
offer
further
resistance
,
his
spirit
be
not
quell
,
and
his
eye
glare
terribly
at
his
captor
.
<EOS>
fear
they
may
have
further
trouble
with
him
when
he
recover
from
his
present
exhausted
condition
,
Crouch
have
his
hand
bind
tightly
together
with
one
of
the
dog
leash
,
and
then
would
fain
have
question
him
as
to
how
he
manage
to
breathe
in
a
hole
below
the
level
of
the
water
;
but
Jem
refuse
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
,
and
return
only
a
sullen
rejoinder
to
any
question
address
to
him
,
until
the
squire
,
who
have
cross
the
river
at
some
step
-
stone
low
down
,
come
up
,
and
the
ruffian
then
inquire
,
in
a
half
-
menace
tone
,
what
he
mean
to
do
with
him
?

Cliviger
.
<EOS>
You
may
as
well
tarry
for
me
at
the
Abbey
,
for
Sir
Ralph
will
be
glad
of
thy
company
,
and
we
can
return
together
to
Downham
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
the
squire
thus
speak
,
he
notice
a
singular
sparkle
in
Fogg
's
ill
-
set
eye
;
but
he
think
nothing
of
it
at
the
time
,
though
it
subsequently
occur
to
his
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
prisoner
,
find
no
grace
likely
to
be
show
him
,
shout
out
to
the
squire
,
that
if
he
be
set
free
,
he
would
make
certain
important
disclosure
to
him
respect
Fogg
,
who
be
not
what
he
represent
himself
;
but
Nicholas
treat
the
offer
with
disdain
;
and
the
individual
mainly
interest
in
the
matter
,
who
appear
highly
incense
by
Jem
's
malignity
,
cut
a
short
peg
by
way
of
gag
,
and
,
thrust
it
into
the
ruffian
's
mouth
,
effectually
check
any
more
revelation
on
his
part
.
 
<EOS>
Fogg
then
order
the
varlet
to
bring
on
the
prisoner
;
but
as
Jem
obstinately
refuse
to
move
,
they
be
under
the
necessity
of
take
him
on
their
shoulder
,
and
transport
him
in
this
manner
to
the
stable
,
where
he
be
place
on
a
horse
,
as
direct
by
the
squire

CHAPTER
II.--THE
PENITENT
's
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
Nicholas
and
Sherborne
return
by
a
different
road
from
that
take
by
the
other
,
and
loiter
so
much
by
the
way
that
they
do
not
arrive
at
the
manor
-
house
until
the
prisoner
and
his
escort
have
set
out
.
<EOS>
probably
this
be
design
,
as
Nicholas
seem
relieved
when
he
learn
they
be
go
.
<EOS>
have
enter
the
house
with
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
and
conduct
him
to
an
apartment
open
out
of
the
hall
,
usually
occupy
by
Mistress
Assheton
,
and
where
,
in
fact
,
they
find
that
amiable
lady
employ
at
her
embroidery
,
he
leave
Sherborne
with
her
,
and
,
make
some
excuse
for
his
own
hasty
retreat
,
betook
himself
to
another
part
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
mount
the
principal
staircase
,
which
be
of
dark
oak
,
with
richly
-
carve
railing
,
he
turn
into
a
gallery
communicate
with
the
sleep
apartment
,
and
,
after
proceed
more
than
half
-
way
down
it
,
halt
before
a
door
,
which
he
unlock
,
and
enter
a
spacious
but
evidently
disuse
chamber
,
hang
round
with
fade
tapestry
,
and
contain
a
large
gloomy
-
look
bedstead
.
<EOS>
secure
the
door
carefully
after
him
,
Nicholas
raise
the
hanging
in
one
corner
of
the
room
,
and
press
against
a
spring
,
a
slide
panel
fly
open
.
<EOS>
a
screen
be
place
within
,
so
as
to
hide
from
view
the
inmate
of
the
secret
chamber
,
and
Nicholas
,
have
cough
slightly
,
to
announce
his
presence
,
and
receive
an
answer
in
a
low
,
melancholy
female
voice
,
step
through
the
aperture
,
and
stand
within
a
small
closet
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
tenant
by
a
lady
,
whose
feature
and
figure
bear
the
strong
mark
of
affliction
.
<EOS>
Her
person
be
so
attenuate
that
she
look
little
more
than
a
skeleton
--
<EOS>
her
finger
be
long
and
thin
--
her
cheek
hollow
and
deathly
pale
--
<EOS>
her
eye
lustreless
and
deep
sink
in
their
socket
--
and
her
hair
,
once
jetty
as
the
raven
's
wing
,
prematurely
blanch
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
profound
gloom
stamp
upon
her
countenance
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
look
upon
her
without
compassion
;
while
,
in
spite
of
her
wo
-
begone
look
,
there
be
a
noble
character
about
her
that
elevate
the
feeling
into
deep
interest
,
blend
with
respect
.
<EOS>
She
be
kneel
beside
a
small
desk
,
with
an
open
Bible
lay
upon
it
,
which
she
be
intently
study
when
the
squire
appear
.
 
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
terrible
text
for
you
,
Nicholas
,
"
she
say
,
regard
him
,
mournfully
.
<EOS>
"
listen
to
it
,
and
judge
of
its
effect
on
me
.
<EOS>
thus
it
be
write
in
Deuteronomy:--'There
<EOS>
shall
not
be
find
among
you
any
one
that
maketh
his
son
or
his
daughter
to
pass
through
the
fire
,
or
that
useth
divination
,
or
an
observer
of
time
,
or
an
enchanter
,
or
a
witch
.
'
<EOS>
a
witch
,
Nicholas
--
do
you
mark
the
word
?
<EOS>
and
yet
more
particular
be
the
next
verse
<EOS>
,
wherein
it
be
said;--'or
a
charmer
,
or
a
consulter
with
familiar
spirit
,
or
a
wizard
,
or
a
necromancer
.
'
<EOS>
and
then
cometh
the
denunciation
of
divine
anger
against
such
offender
in
these
awful
words:--'For
all
that
do
these
thing
<EOS>
be
an
abomination
unto
the
Lord
:
and
because
of
these
abomination
,
the
Lord
thy
God
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
thee
.
'
<EOS>
again
,
it
be
say
in
Leviticus
,
that
'
the
Lord
setteth
his
face
against
such
,
to
cut
them
off
.
'
<EOS>
and
in
Exodus
,
the
law
be
expressly
lay
down
thus--'thou
SHALT
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
.
'
<EOS>
there
be
no
escape
for
her
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
by
the
divine
command
she
must
perish
,
and
human
justice
must
;
carry
out
the
decree
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
,
I
be
one
of
the
offender
thus
denounce
,
thus
condemn
.
<EOS>
I
have
practise
witchcraft
,
consult
with
familiar
spirit
,
and
do
other
abomination
in
the
sight
of
Heaven
;
and
I
ought
to
pay
the
full
penalty
of
my
offence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
,
I
beseech
you
,
madam
,
"
reply
the
squire
,
"
continue
to
take
this
view
of
your
case
.
<EOS>
however
you
have
sin
,
you
have
make
amend
by
the
depth
and
sincerity
of
your
repentance
.
<EOS>
Your
day
and
night
--
for
you
allow
yourself
only
such
rest
as
nature
force
on
you
,
and
take
even
that
most
unwillingly
--
be
pass
in
constant
prayer
.
<EOS>
Your
abstinence
be
severe
than
any
anchoress
ever
practise
,
for
I
be
sure
for
the
last
month
you
have
not
take
as
much
food
altogether
as
I
consume
in
a
day
;
while
,
not
content
with
this
,
you
perform
act
of
penance
that
afflict
me
beyond
measure
to
think
upon
,
and
which
I
have
strive
in
vain
to
induce
you
to
forego
.
<EOS>
there
will
be
no
occasion
to
deliver
yourself
up
to
justice
,
madam
;
for
,
if
you
go
on
thus
,
and
do
not
deal
with
yourself
a
little
more
mildly
,
your
account
with
this
world
will
be
speedily
settle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
should
rejoice
to
think
so
,
Nicholas
,
"
reply
Mistress
Nutter
,
"
if
I
have
any
hope
in
the
world
to
come
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
none
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
by
any
act
of
penitence
and
contrition
,
expiate
my
offence
.
<EOS>
My
soul
be
darken
by
despair
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
ought
to
give
myself
up
--
that
Heaven
and
man
alike
require
my
life
,
and
I
can
not
reconcile
myself
to
avoid
my
just
doom
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
Evil
One
who
put
these
thought
into
your
head
,
"
reply
Nicholas
,
"
and
who
fill
your
heart
with
prompting
of
despair
,
that
he
may
again
obtain
the
mastery
over
it
.
<EOS>
but
take
a
calm
and
more
consolatory
view
of
your
condition
.
<EOS>
human
justice
may
require
a
public
sacrifice
as
an
example
,
but
Heaven
,
will
be
satisfied
with
contrition
in
secret
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
trust
so
,
"
reply
the
lady
,
vainly
strive
to
draw
comfort
from
his
word
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Nicholas
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
know
the
temptation
I
be
expose
to
in
this
chamber
--
<EOS>
the
difficulty
I
experience
in
keep
my
thought
fix
on
one
object
--
the
distraction
I
undergo
--
the
mental
obscuration
--
the
fainting
of
spirit
--
the
bodily
prostration
--
the
terror
,
the
inconceivable
terror
,
that
assail
me
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
wish
my
spirit
would
flee
away
,
and
be
at
rest
.
<EOS>
rest
!
<EOS>
there
be
none
for
me
--
none
in
the
grave
--
none
beyond
the
grave
--
and
therefore
I
be
afraid
of
death
,
and
still
more
of
the
judgment
after
death
!
<EOS>
Man
may
inflict
all
the
torture
he
could
devise
upon
this
poor
frame
.
<EOS>
I
would
bear
them
all
with
patience
,
with
delight
,
if
I
think
they
would
purchase
me
immunity
hereafter
!
<EOS>
but
with
the
dread
conviction
,
the
almost
certainty
,
that
it
will
be
otherwise
<EOS>
,
I
can
only
look
to
the
final
consummation
with
despair
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
again
I
tell
you
these
suggestion
be
evil
,
"
say
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Son
of
God
,
who
sacrifice
himself
for
man
,
and
by
whose
atonement
all
mankind
hope
for
salvation
,
have
assure
us
that
the
great
sinner
who
repent
shall
be
forgive
,
and
,
indeed
,
be
more
acceptable
in
the
eye
of
Heaven
than
him
who
have
never
err
.
<EOS>
far
be
it
from
me
to
attempt
to
exculpate
you
in
your
own
eye
,
or
extenuate
your
former
criminality
.
<EOS>
You
have
sin
deeply
,
so
deeply
that
you
may
well
shrink
aghast
from
the
contemplation
of
your
past
life
--
may
well
recoil
in
abhorrence
from
yourself
--
and
may
fitly
devote
yourself
to
constant
prayer
and
act
of
penitence
.
<EOS>
but
have
cast
off
your
iniquity
,
and
sincerely
repent
,
I
bid
you
hope
--
<EOS>
I
bid
you
place
a
confident
reliance
in
the
clemency
of
an
all

merciful
power

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
give
me
much
comfort
,
Nicholas
,
"
say
the
lady
,
"
and
if
tear
of
blood
can
wash
away
my
sin
they
shall
be
shed
;
but
much
as
you
know
of
my
wickedness
,
even
you
can
not
conceive
its
extent
.
<EOS>
in
my
madness
,
for
it
be
nothing
else
,
I
cast
off
all
hope
of
heaven

renounce
my
Redeemer
,
be
baptise
by
the
demon

enter
into
a
compact
by
which

to
speak
it

my
soul
be
surrender
to
him

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
place
yourself
in
fearful
jeopardy
,
no
doubt
,
"
rejoin
Nicholas
;

but
you
have
break
the
contract
in
time

bond

He

contest
the
point

the
ear

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
do
you
hear

demand
Mistress
Nutter

in
accent
of
wildest
terror

He
be
ever
on
the
watch

<EOS>
I

I
know
it

"
 
<EOS>
clasp
her
hand
together
,
and
fix
her
look
on
high
<EOS>
she
then
address
the
most
fervent
supplication
to
Heaven
for
deliverance
from
evil

and
erelong
her
troubled
countenance

Her

greatly
alarm

have
drop
upon

now
arise
with
somewhat
more
composure
in

demeanour

aspect

<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry

do
not

this
morning

as
the
fellow

greatly
exasperate
against

he
threaten
to
betray
your
retreat
to
the
officer

though
he
be

probably
,
unacquainted
with
it
notwithstanding
his
boasting

still
he
may
cause
search
to

You
know

You
would

brand
for
ever

Alizon

<EOS>

I
would
not

you

Nicholas

evasively

for

mine

I
must
urge
you
to
seek
some

refuge
to
night

here
you

<EOS>
yet
still

remain
for

two

over

some
hesitation

the
lady

hence

bleak
fell

desolate
moor

as
to
Mother
Demdike

I

you

ghost

evil

do
you
mischief

strong

them

them
brother
and
sister

<EOS>
profound
melancholy
pervade
the
countenance
of
the
young
man
,
whose
handsome
brow
be
cloud
by
care
--
while
the
girl
,
though
sad
,
seem
so
only
from
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
converse
together
in
deep
and
earnest
tone
,
show
how
greatly
they
be
interested
;
and
,
as
they
proceed
,
many
an
involuntary
sigh
be
heave
by
Richard
Assheton
,
while
a
tear
,
more
than

brightness
of
his
sister
's
eye
,
and
her
hand
seek
by
its
gentle
pressure
to
re
-
assure
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
talk
of
Alizon
,
of
her
peculiar
and
distressing
situation
,
and
of
the
young
man
's
hopeless
love
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
general
theme
of
their
discourse
,
for
Richard
's
sole
comfort
be
in
pour
forth
his
griefs
into
his
sister
's
willing
ear
;
but
new
cause
of
anxiety
have
be
give
them
by
Nicholas
,
who
have
arrive
that
afternoon
,
bring
intelligence
of
James
Device
's
capture
,
and
of
his
threat
against
Mistress
Nutter
.
<EOS>
the
squire
have
only
just
depart
,
have
succeed
in
the
twofold
object
of
his
visit
--
which
be
,
firstly
,
to
borrow
three
hundred
pound
from
his
cousin
--
and
,
secondly
,
to
induce
him
to
attend
the
meeting
at
Hoghton
Tower
.
<EOS>
with
the
first
request
Richard
willingly
comply
,
and
he
assent
,
though
with
some
reluctance
,
to
the
second
,
provide
nothing
of
serious
moment
should
occur
in
the
interim
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
try
to
rally
him
on
his
despondency
,
endeavour
to
convince
him
all
would
come
right
in
time
,
and
that
his
misgiving
be
causeless
;
but
his
argument
be
ineffectual
,
and
he
be
soon
compel
to
desist
.
<EOS>
the
squire
would
fain
also
have
see
Alizon
,
but
,
understand
she
always
remain
secluded
in
her
chamber
till
eventide
,
he
do
not
press
the
point
.
<EOS>
Richard
urge
him
to
stay
over
the
night
,
allege
the
length
of
the
ride
,
and
the
speedy
approach
of
evening
,
as
inducement
to
him
to
remain
;
but
on
this
score
the
squire
be
resolute
--
and
have
carefully
secure
the
large
sum
of
money
he
have
obtain
beneath
his
doublet
,
he
mount
his
favourite
steed
,
Robin
,
who
seem
as
fresh
as
if
he
have
not
achieve
upwards
of
thirty
mile
that
morning
,
and
ride
off
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
watch
him
cross
the
drawbridge
,
and
take
the
road
towards
Rochdale
,
and
,
after
exchange
a
farewell
wave
of
the
hand
with
him
,
return
to
the
hall
and
seek
out
his
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Dorothy
be
easily
persuade
to
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
with
her
brother
,
and
during
their
walk
he
confide
to
her
all
he
have
hear
from
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
Her
alarm
at
Jem
Device
's
threat
be
much
great
than
his
own
;
and
,
though
she
entertain
a
strong
and
unconquerable
aversion
to
Mistress
Nutter
,
and
could
not
be
bring
to
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
her
penitence
,
still
,
for
Alizon
's
sake
,
she
dread
lest
any
harm
should
befall
her
,
and
more
particularly
desire
to
avoid
the
disgrace
which
would
be
inflict
by
a
public
execution
.
<EOS>
Alizon
<EOS>
she
be
sure
would
not
survive
such
a
catastrophe
,
and
therefore
,
at
all
risk
,
it
must
be
avert
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
do
not
share
,
to
the
same
extent
,
in
her
apprehension
,
because
he
have
be
assure
by
Nicholas
that
Mistress
Nutter
would
be
remove
to
a
place
of
perfect
security
,
and
because
he
be
dispose
,
with
the
squire
,
to
regard
the
prisoner
's
threat
as
mere
raving
of
impotent
malice
.
<EOS>
still
he
could
not
help
feel
great
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
vague
fear
,
too
,
beset
him
,
which
he
find
it
in
vain
to
shake
off
,
but
he
do
not
communicate
them
to
his
sister
,
as
he
know
the
terrifying
effect
they
would
have
upon
her
timid
nature
;
and
he
,
therefore
,
keep
the
mental
anguish
he
endure
to
himself
,
hope
erelong
it
would
diminish
in
intensity
.
<EOS>
but
in
this
he
be
deceive
,
for
,
instead
of
abate
,
his
gloom
and
depression
momently
increase
.
 
<EOS>
almost
unconsciously
,
Richard
and
his
sister
have
quit
the
garden
,
proceed
with
slow
and
melancholy
step
to
the
beech
-
crown
knoll
.
<EOS>
the
seat
they
have
choose
be
a
favourite
one
with
Alizon
,
and
she
come
thither
on
most
evening
,
either
accompany
by
Dorothy
or
alone
.
<EOS>
here
it
be
that
Richard
have
more
than
once
passionately
besought
her
to
become
his
bride
,
receive
on
both
occasion
a
same
meek
yet
firm
refusal
.
<EOS>
to
Dorothy
also
,
who
plead
her
brother
's
cause
with
all
the
eloquence
and
fervour
of
which
she
be
mistress
,
Alizon
reply
that
her
affection
be
fix
upon
Richard
;
but
that
,
while
her
mother
live
,
and
need
her
constant
prayer
,
they
must
not
be
withhold
;
and
that
,
look
upon
any
earthly
passion
as
a
criminal
interference
with
this
paramount
duty
,
she
do
not
dare
to
indulge
it
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
represent
to
her
that
the
sacrifice
be
great
than
she
be
call
upon
to
make
,
that
her
health
be
visibly
decline
,
and
that
she
may
fall
a
victim
to
her
over
-
zeal
;
but
Alizon
be
deaf
to
her
remonstrance
,
as
she
have
be
to
the
entreaty
of
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
with
heart
less
burthen
,
the
contemplation
of
the
scene
before
them
could
not
have
fail
to
give
delight
to
Richard
and
his
sister
,
and
,
even
amid
the
adverse
circumstance
under
which
it
be
view
,
its
beauty
and
tranquillity
produce
a
soothing
influence
.
 
<EOS>
evening
be
gradually
steal
on
,
and
all
the
exquisite
tint
mark
that
delightful
hour
,
be
spread
over
the
landscape
.
<EOS>
the
sun
be
set
gorgeously
,
and
a
flood
of
radiance
fall
upon
the
old
mansion
beneath
them
,
and
upon
the
grey
and
venerable
church
,
situate
on
a
hill
adjoin
it
.
<EOS>
the
sound
be
all
in
unison
with
the
hour
,
and
the
lowing
of
cattle
,
the
voice
of
the
husbandman
return
from
their
work
,
mingle
with
the
cawing
of
the
rook
newly
alight
on
the
high
tree
near
the
church
,
tell
them
that
bird
,
man
,
and
beast
be
seek
their
home
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
but
though
Richard
's
eye
dwell
upon
the
fair
garden
beneath
him
,
embrace
all
its
terrace
,
green
slope
,
and
trim
pasture
;
though
it
fall
upon
the
moat
belt
the
hall
like
a
glitter
zone
;
though
it
rest
upon
the
church
tower
;
and
,
roam
over
the
park
beyond
it
,
finally
settle
upon
the
range
of
hill
bound
the
horizon
,
which
have
not
inaptly
be
term
the
English
Apennines
;
though
he
see
all
these
thing
,
he
think
not
of
them
,
neither
be
he
conscious
of
the
sound
that
meet
his
ear
,
and
which
all
speak
of
rest
from
labour
,
and
peace
.
<EOS>
Darker
and
deeper
grow
his
melancholy
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
persuade
himself
he
be
not
long
for
this
world
;
and
,
while
gaze
upon
the
beautiful
prospect
before
him
,
be
perhaps
look
upon
it
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
minute
Dorothy
watch
him
anxiously
,
and
at
last
receive
no
answer
to
her
question
,
and
alarm
by
the
expression
of
his
countenance
,
she
fling
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
and
burst
into
tear
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
Richard
's
turn
to
console
her
,
and
he
inquire
with
much
anxiety
as
to
the
cause
of
this
sudden
outburst
of
grief
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
yourself
be
the
cause
of
it
,
dear
Richard
,
"
reply
Dorothy
,
regard
him
with
brim
eye
;
"
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
so
unhappy

<EOS>
if
you
suffer
this
melancholy
to
grow
upon
you

it
will
affect
both
mind
and
body

<EOS>
just
now
your
countenance
wear
an
expression
most
distress
to
look
upon
.
<EOS>
try
to
smile
,
dear
Richard
,
if
only
to
cheer
me
,
or
else
I
shall
grow
as
sad
as
you
.
<EOS>
ah

me
!
<EOS>
I
have
know
the
day
,
and
not
long
since
either
,
when
on
a
pleasant
summer
evening
like
this
you
would
propose
a
stroll
into
the
park
with
me
;
and
,
when
there
,
would
trip
along
the
glade
as
fleetly
as
a
deer
,
and
defy
me
to
catch
you
.
<EOS>
but
you
always
take
care
<EOS>
I
should
,
though
--
ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
come
,
there
be
a
little
attempt
at
a
smile

<EOS>
that
be
something

<EOS>
You
look
more
like
yourself
now
.
<EOS>
how
happy
we
use
to
be
in
those
day
,
to
be
sure!--and
<EOS>
how
merry
!
<EOS>
You
would
make
the
court
ring
with
your
blithe
laughter
,
and
wellnigh
kill
me
with
your
jest
.
<EOS>
if
love
be
to
make
one
mope
like
an
owl
,
and
sigh
like
the
wind
through

dance

I

not
how

I
feel
unusually
despondent
this
evening

be
haunt
by
a
thousand
dismal
fancy

I
will
do
my
good
to

with
your

I
shall
succeed

there!--there

up

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Richard
!
<EOS>
I
be
quite
happy
now
.
<EOS>
and
after
all
I
do
not
see
why
you
should
take
such
a
gloomy
view
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
there
be
a
great
deal
,
a
very
great
deal
,
of
happiness
in
store
for
you
and
Alizon
<EOS>
--
I
must
couple
her
name
with
yours
,
or
you
will
not
allow
it
to
be
happiness
--
if
you
can
only
be
bring
to
think
so
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
of
it
;
and
you
shall
see
how
nicely
I
can
make
the
matter
out
.
<EOS>
as
thus
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
be
certain
to
die
soon
--
such
a
wicked
woman
can
not
live
long
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
angry
with
me
for
call
her
wicked
,
Richard
;
but
you
know
I
never
can
forget
her
unhallowed
proceeding
in
the
convent
church
at
Whalley
,
<EOS>
where
I
be
so
nearly
become
a
witch
myself
.
<EOS>
well
,
as
I
be
say
,
she
can
not
live
long
,
and
when
she
go
--
and
Heaven
grant
it
may
be
soon!--alizon
,
no
doubt
,
will
mourn
for
her
though
I
shall
not
,
and
after
a
decent
interval
--
then
,
Richard
,
then
she
will
no
longer
say
you
nay
,
but
will
make
you
happy
as
your
wife
.
<EOS>
nay
,
do
not
look
so
sad
again
,
dear
brother
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
make
you
quite
cheerful
by
the
picture
I
be
draw
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
because
I
fear
it
will
never
be
realize
that
I
be
sad
,
Dorothy
,
"
reply
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
My
own
anticipation
be
the
opposite
of
yours

and
paint
Alizon
sink
into
an
early
grave
before
her
mother

while
as
to
myself

if
such
be
the
case

I
shall
not
long
survive
her

"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
now
you
will
make
me
weep
again

"
cry
Dorothy

her
tear
flow
afresh

<EOS>
"
but
I
will
not
allow
you
to
indulge
such
gloomy
idea
,
Richard
.
<EOS>
if
I
seriously
think
Mistress
Nutter
likely
to
occasion
all
this
fresh
mischief
,
I
would
cause
her
to
be
deliver
up
to
justice
,
and
hang
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
You
may
look
cross
at
me
,
but
I
would
.
<EOS>
what
be
an
old
witch
like
her
,
compare
with
two
young
handsome
person
,
die
for
love
of
each
other

yet
not
able
to
marry
on
her
account

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dorothy
,
Dorothy
,
you
must
put
some
restraint
on
your
tongue
,
"
say
Richard
;
"
you
give
it
sadly
too
much
licence
.
<EOS>
You
forget
it
be
the
wish
of
the
unhappy
lady
you
refer
to
,
to
expiate
her
offence
at
the
stake
,
and
that
it
be
only
out
of
consideration
to
her
daughter
that
she
have
be
induce
to
remain
in
concealment
.
<EOS>
what
will
be
the
issue
of
it
all
,
I
dare
scarcely
conjecture
.
<EOS>
wo
to
her
,
I
fear
!
<EOS>
wo
to
Alizon
!
<EOS>
wo
to
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
Richard
,
that
you
should
link
yourself
to
her
fate
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Dorothy
,
half
mournfully
,
half
reproachfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
it
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
destiny
--
a
deplorable
destiny
,
if
you
will
--
but
not
to
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
that
Mistress
Nutter
will
escape
the
consequence
of
her
crime
,
I
can
scarcely
believe
.
<EOS>
Her
penitence
be
profound
and
sincere
,
and
that
be
a
great
consolation
;
for
I
trust
she
will
not
perish
,
body
and
soul
.
<EOS>
I
should
wish
her
to
have
some
spiritual
assistance
,
but
this
Nicholas
will
not
for
the
present
permit
,
allege
that
no
churchman
would
consent
to
screen
her
from
justice
when
he
become
aware
,
as
he
must
by
her
confession
,
of
the
nature
and
magnitude
of
her
offence

<EOS>
this
may
be
true
;
but
when
the
wretch
who
have
be
league
with
her
in
iniquity
be
dispose
of
,
the
reason
will
no
longer
exist

I
will
see
that
she

care
for
.
<EOS>
but
,
apart
from
her
mother
,
I
have
another
source
of
anxiety
respect
Alizon
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
:
order
have
be
this
day
give
for
the
arrest
of
Elizabeth
Device
and
her
daughter
,
Jennet
,
and
Alizon
will
be
the
chief
witness
against
them
.
<EOS>
this
will
be
a
great
trouble
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
undoubtedly
,
"
rejoin
Dorothy
,
with
much
concern
.
<EOS>
"
but
can
it
not

avoid
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
not

"
say
Richard

"
and
I
blame
Nicholas
much
for
his
precipitancy
in
give
the
order
;
but
he
reply
he
have
be
hold
up
latterly
as
a
favourer
of
witch
,
and
must
endeavour
to
redeem
his
character
by
a
display
of
severity

<EOS>
be
it
not
for
Alizon

I
should
rejoice
that
the
noxious
brood
should
at

be
utterly
exterminate

<EOS>
"
and
so
should
I
,
in
good
sooth

"
respond
Dorothy

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
to
Elizabeth
Device
,
she
be
bad
enough
for
any
thing
,
and
capable
of
almost
any
mischief
:
but
she
be
nothing
to
Jennet
,
who
,
I
be
persuade
,
would
become
a
second
Mother
Demdike
if
her
career
be
not
cut
short

<EOS>
You
have
see
the

know
what
an
ill

favour
,
deform
little
creature
she
be
,
with
round
high
shoulder

eye
set
strangely
in
her
face

such
a
malicious
expression

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
shudder
to

of
it

she
cover
her
face

unpleasant
object

off

<EOS>
the

better

even

guiltless

than
hereafter

with
crime

<EOS>
as
he
conclude
,
he
put
his
hand
quickly
to
his
side
,
for
a
sharp
and
sudden
pang
shoot
through
his
heart
;
and
so
acute
be
the
pain
,
that
,
after
struggle
against
it
for
a
moment
,
he
groan
deeply
,
and
would
have
fall
,
if
his
sister

greatly
alarm
,

with
difficulty
repress
a
scream

have
not
lend
him
support

<EOS>
neither
of
them
be
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
little
girl

who
have
approach
the
place
where
they
be
sit
,
with
footstep
so
light
that
the
grass
scarcely
seem
to
bend
beneath
them
,
and
who
,
ensconce
herself
behind
the
tree
,
drink
in
their
discourse
with
eager
ear
.
<EOS>
She
be
attend
by
a
large
black
cat
,
who
,
climb
the
tree
,
place
himself
on
a
bough
above
her
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
latter
part
of
the
conversation
,
and
when
it
turn
upon
the
arrest
of
Jennet
and
her
mother
,
the
expression
of
the
child
's
countenance
,
malicious
enough
to
begin
with
,
become
desperately
malignant
,
and
she
be
only
restrain
by
certain
sign
from
the
cat
,
which
appear
to
be
intelligible
to
her
,
from
some
act
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
at
last
even
this
fail
,
and
before
the
animal
could
descend
and
check
her
,
she
creep
round
the
bole
of
the
tree
,
so
as
to
bring
herself
close
to
Richard
,
and
mutter
a
spell
,
make
one
or
two
pass
behind
his
back
,
touch
him
with
the
point
of
her
finger
,
but
so
lightly
that
he
be
unconscious
of
the
pressure
,
and
then
hastily
retreat
with
the
cat
,
who
glare
furiously
at
her
from
his
flaming
orb
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
at
the
moment
she
touch
him
that
Richard
feel
as
if
an
arrow
be
quiver
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dorothy
's
alarm
be
so
great
that
she
could
not
even
scream
for
assistance
,
and
she
fear
,
if
she
quit
her
brother
,
he
would
expire
before
her
return
;
but
the
agony
,
though
great
,
be
speedily
over
,
and
as
the
spasm
cease
,
he
look
up
,
and
,
with
a
faint
smile
,
strove
to
re
-
assure
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
alarm

"
he
say
;
"
it
be
nothing
--
a
momentary
faintness
--
that
be
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
the
damp
upon
his
brow
,
and
the
deathly
hue
of
his
cheek
,
contradict
the
assertion
,
and
show
how
much
he
have
endure
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
more
than
momentary
faintness
,
dear
Richard
,
"
reply
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
frightful
seizure
--
so
frightful
that
I
almost
fear

no
matter

easily
alarm

God

colour

well

you
not

Alizon
come
towards
us
?
<EOS>
not
a
word
of
this
sudden
seizure
to
her
.
<EOS>
do
you
mind
,
Dorothy

"
 
<EOS>
Alizon
be
soon
close
behind
them
,
and
though
,
in
obedience
to
Richard
's
injunction
,
no
allusion
be
make
to
his
recent
illness
,
she
at
once
perceive
he
be
suffer
greatly
,
and
with
much
solicitude
inquire
into
the
cause
.
<EOS>
Richard
avoid
give
a
direct
answer
,
and
,
immediately
enter
upon
Nicholas
's
visit
,
try
to
divert
her
attention
from
himself
.
 
<EOS>
so
great
a
change
have
be
work
in
Alizon
's
appearance
and
manner
during
the
last
few
week
,
that
she
could
scarcely
be
recognise
.
<EOS>
still
beautiful
as
ever
,
her
beauty
have
lose
its
earthly
character
,
and
have
become
in
the
high
degree
spiritualise
and
refine
.
<EOS>
humility
of
deportment
and
resignation
of
look
,
blend
with
an
expression
of
religious
fervour
,
give
her
the
appearance
of
one
of
the
early
martyr
.
<EOS>
unremitte
ardour
in
the
pursuance
of
her
devotional
exercise
by
day
,
and
long
vigil
at
night
,
have
wear
down
her
frame
,
and
rob
it
of
some
of
its
grace
and
fulness
of
outline
;
but
this
attenuation
have
a
charm
of
its
own
,
and
give
a
touching
interest
to
her
figure
,
which
be
want
before
.
<EOS>
if
her
check
be
thin
and
paler
,
her
eye
look
large
and
bright
,
and
more
akin
to
the
star
in
splendour
;
and
if
she
appear
less
childlike
,
less
joyous
,
less
free
from
care
,
the
want
of
these
quality
be
more
than
counterbalance
by
increase
gentleness
,
resignation
,
and
serenity
.
 
<EOS>
deeply
interested
in
all
Richard
tell
her
of
her
mother
<EOS>
,
she
be
greatly
concerned
to
hear
of
the
intended
arrest
of
Elizabeth
and
Jennet
Device
,
especially
the
latter
.
<EOS>
for
this
unhappy
and
misguided
child
she
have
once
entertain
the
affection
of
a
sister
,
and
it
could
not
but
be
a
source
of
grief
to
her
to
reflect
upon
her
probable
fate

<EOS>
little
more
pass
between
them
,
for
Richard
,
feel
his
strength
again
fail
him
,
be
anxious
to
reach
the
house
,
and
Dorothy
be
quite
unequal
to
conversation
.
<EOS>
They
part
at
the
door
,
and
as
Alizon
,
after
take
leave
of
her
friend
,
turn
to
continue
her
walk
in
the
garden
,
Richard
stagger
into
the
entrance
-
hall
,
and
sink
upon
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
desire
to
be
alone
,
for
she
do
not
wish
to
have
a
witness
to
the
grief
that
overpower
her
,
and
which
,
when
she
have
gain
a
retire
part
of
the
garden
,
where
she
suppose
herself
free
from
all
observation
,
find
relief
in
a
flood
of
tear
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
minute
she
be
a
prey
to
violent
and
irrepressible
emotion
,
and
have
scarcely
regain
a
show
of
composure
,
when
she
hear
herself
address
,
as
she
think
,
in
the
voice
of
the
very
child
whose
unlucky
fate
she
be
deplore
.
<EOS>
look
round
in
surprise
,
and
see
no
one
,
she
begin
to
think
fancy
must
have
cheat
her
,
when
a
low
malicious
laugh
,
arise
from
a
shrubbery
near
her
,
convince
her
that
Jennet
be
hide
there
.
<EOS>
and
the
next
moment
the
little
girl
step
from
out
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
's
first
impulse
be
to
catch
the
child
in
her
arm
,
and
press
her
to
her
bosom
;
but
there
be
something
in
Jennet
's
look
that
deter
her
,
and
so
embarrassed
her
,
that
she
be
unable
to
bestow
upon
her
the
ordinary
greeting
of
affection
,
or
even
approach
her
.
 
<EOS>
Jennet
seem
to
enjoy
her
confusion
,
and
laugh
spitefully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
dunna
seem
ower
glad
to
see
me
,
sister
Alizon
,
"
say
Jennet
,
at
length

CHAPTER
IV.--THE
gorge
of
CLIVIGER
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
have
already
set
as
Nicholas
Assheton
reach
Todmorden
,
then
a
very
small
village
indeed
,
and
alight
at
a
little
inn
near
the
church
,
find
the
ale
so
good
,
and
so
many
boon
companion
assemble
to
discuss
it
,
that
he
would
fain
have
tarry
with
them
for
an
hour
or
so
;
but
prudence
,
for
once
,
get
the
well
of
inclination
,
and
suggest
that
he
have
fifteen
or
sixteen
mile
still
to
ride
,
over
a
rough
and
lonely
road
,
part
of
which
lie
through
the
gorge
of
Cliviger
,
a
long
and
solitary
pass
among
the
English
Apennines
,
and
,
moreover
,
have
a
large
sum
of
money
about
him
,
he
tear
himself
away
by
a
great
effort
.
 
<EOS>
on
quit
the
smile
valley
of
Todmorden
,
and
draw
near
the
dangerous
defile
before
mention
,
some
misgiving
cross
him
,
and
he
almost
reproach
himself
with
foolhardiness
in
venture
within
it
at
such
an
hour
,
and
wholly
unattended
.
<EOS>
several
recent
case
of
robbery
,
some
of
them
attend
by
murder
,
have
occur
within
the
pass
;
and
these
now
occur
so
forcibly
to
the
squire
,
that
he
be
half
inclined
to
ride
back
to
Todmorden
,
and
engage
two
or
three
of
the
toper
he
have
leave
at
the
inn
to
serve
him
as
an
escort
as
far
as
Burnley
,
but
he
dismiss
the
idea
almost
as
soon
as
form
,
and
,
cast
one
look
at
the
green
and
woody
slope
around
him
,
strike
spur
into
Robin
,
and
dash
into
the
gorge
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
right
tower
a
precipice
,
on
the
bare
crest
of
which
stand
a
heap
of
stone
pile
like
a
column
--
the
remain
,
probably
,
of
a
cairn
.
<EOS>
on
this
commanding
point
Nicholas
perceive
a
female
figure
,
dilate
to
gigantic
proportion
against
the
sky
,
who
,
as
far
as
he
could
distinguish
,
seem
watch
him
,
and
make
sign
to
him
,
apparently
to
go
back
;
but
he
pay
little
regard
to
them
,
and
soon
afterwards
lose
sight
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
precipitous
and
almost
inaccessible
rock
,
of
every
variety
of
form
and
hue
;
some
spring
perpendicularly
up
like
the
spire
of
a
church
,
other
run
along
in
broken
ridge
,
or
present
the
appearance
of
high
embattle
wall
<EOS>
;
here
rive
into
deep
gully
,
there
open
into
wild
savage
glen
,
fit
spot
for
robber
ambuscade
;
now
present
a
fair
smooth
surface
,
now
jagged
,
shatter
,
shelving
,
roughen
with
brushwood
;
sometimes
bleach
and
hoary
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
pinnacle
crag
call
the
White
Kirk
;
sometimes
green
with
moss
or
grey
with
lichen
;
sometimes
,
though
but
rarely
,
shade
with
timber
,
as
in
the
approach
to
the
cavern
name
the
Earl
's
Bower
;
but
generally
bold
and
naked
,
and
sombre
in
tint
as
the
colour
employ
by
the
savage
Rosa
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
distinguishing
feature
of
the
gorge
of
Cliviger
when
Nicholas
traverse
it
.
<EOS>
now
the
high
embankment
and
mighty
arch
of
a
railway
fill
up
its
recess
and
span
its
gully
;
the
roar
of
the
engine
be
hear
where
the
cry
of
the
bird
of
prey
alone
resound
;
and
cloud
of
steam
usurp
the
place
of
the
mist
-
wreath
on
its
crag
.
 
<EOS>
formerly
,
the
high
cliff
abound
with
hawk
;
the
rock
echo
with
their
yell
and
screech

and
the
spot
adjoin
their

resemble
,
in
the
word
of
the

of
the
district
,
Whitaker
,
"
little
charnel

house

inaccessible
point

the

rear
its
brood
from

<EOS>
the
gaunt

once

the

the
sly
fox

fierce

the
gorge

<EOS>
the
general
savage
character
of
the
ravine
be

by
some
spot
of
exquisite
beauty

where
the
traveller
may
have
linger
with
delight

in

in
one
unbroken
sheet

<EOS>
through
the
midst
of
the
gorge
run
a
swift
and
brawl
stream
,
know
by
the
appellation
of
the
Calder
;
but
it
must
not
be
confound
with
the
river

past
Whalley
Abbey

<EOS>
the
course
of
this
impetuous
current
be
not
always
restrained
within
its
rocky
channel
,
and
when
swell
by
heavy
rain
,
it
would
frequently
invade
the
narrow
causeway
run
beside
it
,
and
,
spread
over
the
whole
width
of
the
gorge
,
render
the
road
almost
impassable
.
 
<EOS>
through
this
rocky
and
sombre
defile
,
and
by
the
side
of
the
brawling
Calder
,
which
dash
swiftly
past
him
,
Nicholas
take
his
way
.
<EOS>
the
hawk
be
yell
overhead
;
the
rook
be
caw
on
the
topmost
branch
of
some
tall
timber
,
on
which
they

a
raven

he
strike

his
pace

he

He

thrust
a

across

to
the

like
a
bandit
;
and
a
white
owl
burst
from

,
scare
him
as

<EOS>
however

in

Nicholas

seat

Robin

who
seem
no
way
incommode
by
his
double
burthen

dash
down
the
further
side

causeway

sharp
application

spur

her
arm
round

heedless

gathering
gloom

mile
be

whisper
in

ear

Stones

presently
they
come
to
a
narrow
glen

half
-
fill
with
huge
rocky
fragment
,
detach
from
the
topple
precipice
on
either
side

and
form
an
admirable
place

ambuscade

one
rock
,
large
than

rest

completely
command
the
pass

and
,
as
the

advance
,
a
thundering
voice
from
it
call
to
him
to
stay

the
injunction

unmoved

marksman

at

time
four

stone

level

sharp
discharge
echo
along

the
shot
rattle
against

none

Nicholas
may
have
go
on
without

hindrance

,
despite
Nance

remonstrance
,
who
urge
him
to
go
on
,
he
pull
up
to
await
the
coming
of
the
person

have
first

<EOS>
scarcely
an
instant
elapse
before
he
be
beside

petronel
at

discharge

petronel
full
at

ball
rebound

as

doublet
have

<EOS>
It
be
in
fact
line
with
gold

on
see
the

unhurt

the
robber
captain
utter
an
exclamation
of
rage
and
astonishment

"
You
be
mistaken

you
see

perfidious
villain

cry
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
yet
to
render
an
account

all

wrong
you
have

me

but
meantime
you
shall
not
pass
unpunished

"
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
speak
,
he
snatch
the
petronel
from
Fogg
,
and
with
the
but
-
end
deal
him
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
head

fell
him
to
the
ground

by
this
time
the
other
robber
have
descend
from
the
rock

and
,
see
the
fall
of
their
leader
,
rush
forward
to
avenge
him
,
but
Nicholas
do
not
tarry
for
any
further
encounter
;
but
,
fully
satisfied
with
what
he
have
do
,
strike
spur
into
Robin
,
and
gallop
off
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
minute
he
could
hear
the
shout
of
the
man
,
but
they
soon
afterwards
die
away
.
 
<EOS>
little
more
than
half
the
ravine
have
be
traverse
when
the
rencounter
above
describe
take
place
;
but
,
though
the
road
be
still
difficult
and
dangerous
,
and
render
doubly
so
by
the
obscurity
,
no
further
hindrance
occur
till
just
as
Nicholas
be
quit
the
gloomy
intricacy
of
the
gorge
,
and
approach
the
more
open
country
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
at
this
point
Robin
fall
,
throw
both
him
and
Nance
,
and
when
the
animal
rise
again
<EOS>
he
be
find
to
be
so
much
injure
that
it
be
impossible
to
mount
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
resource
but
to
proceed
to
Burnley
,
which
be
still
three
or
four
mile
distant
,
on
foot
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
,
Nance
volunteer
to
provide
the
squire
with
another
steed
,
but
he
resolutely
refuse
the
offer
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
--
none
of
your
broomstick
for
me

he
cry
;

no
devil
's
horse

do
not
know
where
they
may
carry
me

<EOS>
My
own
leg
must
serve
me
now

<EOS>
I
will
just
take
poor
Robin
out
of
the
road
,
and
then
trudge
off
for
Burnley
as
fast
as
I
can
.

"
 
<EOS>
with
this
,
he
lead
the
horse
to
a
small
green
mead
skirt
the
stream
,
and
take
off
his
saddle
and
bridle
,
and
deposit
them
carefully
under
a
tree
,
he
pat
the
animal
on
the
neck
,
promise
to
return
for
him
on
the
morrow
,
and
then
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
,
with
Nance
walk
beside
him
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
go
far
,
however
,
when
the
clattering
of
hoofs
be
hear
behind
them
,
and
it
be
evident
that
several
horseman
be
rapidly
approach
.
<EOS>
Nance
stop
,
listen
for
a
moment
,
and
then
declare
that
it
be
Demdike
and
his
band
in
pursuit
,
seize
the
squire
's
arm
and
draw
him
out
of
the
road
,
and
under
the
shelter
of
some
bush
of
hazel
.
<EOS>
the
robber
captain
could
only
have
be
stun
,
it
appear
;
and
,
as
soon
as
he
have
recover
from
the
effect
of
the
blow
,
have
mount
his
horse
,
which
be
conceal
,
with
those
of
his
man
,
behind
the
rock
,
and
start
after
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
construction
put
upon
the
matter
by
Nance
,
and
the
event
prove
it
correct
.
<EOS>
a
loud
shout
from
the
horseman
,
and
a
sudden
halt
,
proclaim
that
poor
Robin
have
be
discover
;
and
this
circumstance
seem
to
give
great
satisfaction
to
Demdike
,
who
loudly
declare
that
they
be
now
sure
of
overtake
the
runaway
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
can
not

far
off

they

themselves

look
well
about
you

so
say
,
he
ride
on

and
it
be
evident
from
the
noise
,
that
the

implicitly
obey
his
injunction

nothing

ere
many
minute

at
the

he
discharge
a

into
the
large

as
no

the
report
,
he
said--
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
see
something
move
here
,
but
I
suppose
I
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
they
have
get
on
further
than
we
expect
,
or
have
retire
into
some
of
the
clough
,
in
which
case
it
will
be
useless
to
search
for
them
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
will
make
sure
of
them
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
two
of
you
shall
form
an
ambuscade
near
Holme
and
two
further
on
within
half
a
mile
of
Burnley
,
and
shall
remain
on
the
watch
till
dawn
,
so
that
you
will
be
sure
to
capture
them
,
and
when
take
,
make
away
with
them
without
hesitation
.
<EOS>
unless
my
skull
have
be
of
the
strong
,
that
butcherly
squire
would
have
crack
it

so
he
shall
have
no
grace
from
me

and
as
to
that
treacherous
witch
,
Nance
Redferne
,
she
deserve
death
at
our
hand

and
she
shall
have
her
desert

<EOS>
I
have
long
suspect
her
,
and
,
indeed
,
be
a
fool
to
trust
one
of
the
vile
Chattox
brood
,
who
be
all
my
natural
enemy
--
but
no
matter
,
I
shall
have
my
revenge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the

promise
compliance
with
their

he
go
on--

<EOS>
as

myself

I

as
fast

me

will
tell
you
why

<EOS>
It

CHAPTER
v.--the
end
of
MALKIN
TOWER
.
  
<EOS>
the
shade
of
night
have
fall
on
Downham
manor
-
house
,
and
with
an
ache
heart
,
and
a
strong
presentiment
of
ill
,
Mistress
Nutter
prepare
to
quit
the
little
chamber
which
have
shelter
her
for
more
than
two
month
,
and
where
she
would
willingly
have
breathe
her
late
sigh
,
if
it
have
be
so
permit
her
.
<EOS>
close
the
Bible
<EOS>
she
have
be
read
,
she
place
the
sacred
volume
under
her
arm
,
and
take
up
a
small
bundle
,
contain
her
slender
preparation
for
travel
,
extinguish
the
taper
,
and
then
descend
by
a
secret
staircase
,
pass
through
a
door
,
fashion
externally
like
a
cupboard
,
and
enter
a
summer
-
house
,
where
she
find
old
Crouch
await
her
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
whisper
word
only
pass
between
her
and
the
huntsman
,
and
inform
her
that
the
horse
be
in
wait
at
the
back
of
the
garden
<EOS>
,
he
take
the
bundle
from
her
,
and
would
fain
have
relieve
her
also
of
the
Bible
,
but
she
would
not
part
with
it
,
and
press
it
more
closely
to
her
bosom
,
say
she
be
quite
ready
to
attend
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
beautiful
,
starlight
night
;
the
air
soft
and
balmy
,
and
laden
with
the
perfume
of
the
flower
.
<EOS>
a
nightingale
be
singe
plaintively
in
an
adjoining
tree
,
and
presently
come
a
response
equally
tender
from
another
part
of
the
grove
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
could
not
choose
but
listen
,
and
the
melody
so
touch
her
that
she
be
half
suffocate
by
repressed
emotion
,
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
relief
of
tear
be
deny
her
.
 
<EOS>
motion
her
somewhat
impatiently
to
come
on
,
Crouch
strike
into
a
sombre
alley
,
edge
by
clip
yew
-
tree
,
and
terminate
in
a
plantation
,
through
which
a
wind
path
lead
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
<EOS>
whereon
the
mansion
be
situate
.
<EOS>
by
daylight
this
be
a
beautiful
walk
,
afford
exquisite
glimpse
through
the
tree
of
the
surround
scenery
,
and
command
a
noble
view
of
Pendle
Hill
,
the
dominant
point
in
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
but
even
now
to
the
poor
lady
,
so
long
immured
in
her
cell
-
like
chamber
,
and
deprive
of
many
of
nature
's
choice
blessing
,
it
appear
delightful
.
<EOS>
the
fresh
air
,
redolent
of
new
-
mown
hay
,
fan
her
pale
cheek
and
feverish
brow
,
and
allay
her
agitation
and
excitement
.
<EOS>
the
perfect
stillness
,
break
only
by
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
in
the
adjoining
pasture
,
by
the
drowsy
hum
of
the
dor
-
fly
,
or
the
rippling
of
the
beck
in
the
valley
,
further
calm
her
;
and
the
soothing
influence
be
complete
by
a
contemplation
of
the
serene
heaven
,
wherein
be
see
the
starry
host
,
with
the
thin
bright
crescent
of
the
new
moon
in
the
midst
of
them
,
diffuse
a
pearly
light
around
her
.
<EOS>
one
blot
alone
appear
in
the
otherwise
smile
sky
,
and
this
be
a
great
,
ugly
,
black
cloud
lower
over
the
summit
of
Pendle
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
notice
the
portentous
cloud
,
and
notice
also
its
shadow
on
the
hill
,
which
may
have
be
cast
by
the
Fiend
himself
,
so
like
be
it
to
a
demoniacal
shape
with
outstretched
wing
;
but
,
though
shudder
at
the
idea
it
suggest
,
she
would
not
suffer
it
to
obtain
possession
of
her
mind
,
but
resolutely
fix
her
attention
on
other
and
more
pleasing
object
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
they
have
reach
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
and
a
gate
admit
them
to
a
road
run
by
the
side
of
Downham
beck
.
<EOS>
here
they
find
the
horse
in
charge
of
a
man
in
the
dark
red
livery
of
Nicholas
Assheton
,
and
who
be
no
other
than
Tom
Shaw
,
the
rascally
cock
-
master
.
<EOS>
deliver
the
bridle
to
Crouch
,
the
knave
hastily
stride
away
,
but
he
linger
at
a
little
distance
to
see
the
lady
mount
;
and
then
leap
the
hedge
,
strike
through
the
plantation
towards
the
hall
,
chink
the
money
in
his
pocket
as
he
go
,
and
think
how
cleverly
he
have
earn
it
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
go
unpunished
;
for
it
be
a
satisfaction
to
record
that
,
in
walk
through
the
wood
,
he
be
catch
in
a
gin
place
there
by
Crouch
,
which
hold
him
fast
in
its
iron
tooth
till
morning
,
when
he
be
discover
by
one
of
the
under
-
keeper
while
go
his
round
,
in
a
deplorable
condition
,
and
lame
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
unconscious
either
of
the
manner
in
which
she
have
be
betray
,
or
of
the
punishment
await
her
betrayer
,
Mistress
Nutter
follow
her
conductor
in
silence
.
<EOS>
for
a
while
the
road
continue
by
the
side
of
the
brook
,
and
then
quit
it
,
commence
a
long
and
tedious
ascent
,
run
between
high
bank
fringe
with
tree
.
<EOS>
the
overhang
bough
render
it
so
dark
that
Mistress
Nutter
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
old
huntsman
,
though
he
be
not
many
yard
in
advance
of
her
,
but
she
hear
the
tramp
of
his
horse
,
and
that
be
enough
.
 
<EOS>
all
at
once
,
where
the
bough
be
thick
,
and
the
road
dark
,
she
perceive
a
small
fiery
object
on
the
bank
,
and
in
her
alarm
call
out
to
the
huntsman
,
who
,
look
back
for
a
moment
,
laugh
,
and
tell
her
not
to
be
uneasy
,
for
it
be
only
a
glow
-
worm
.
<EOS>
ashamed
of
her
idle
fear
she
ride
on
,
but
have
not
proceed
far
,
when
,
look
again
at
the
bank
,
she
see
it
studded
with
the
same
light
.
<EOS>
this
time
she
do
not
call
out
or
scream
,
but
gaze
steadily
at
the
twinkle
fire
,
hope
to
get
the
well
of
her
fear
.
<EOS>
Her
alarm
,
however
,
rise
to
absolute
terror
,
as
she
behold
the
glow
-
worm
--
if
glow
-
worm
they
be
--
twist
together
and
form
themselves
into
a
flaming
brand
,
such
as
she
have
see
in
her
vision
,
grasp
by
the
angel
who
have
drive
her
from
the
gate
of
Paradise
.
 
<EOS>
avert
her
gaze
,
she
would
have
hasten
on
,
but
a
hand
suddenly
lay
upon
her
bridle
,
hold
back
her
horse
;
and
she
then
perceive
a
tall
dark
man
,
mount
on
a
sable
steed
,
ride
beside
her
.
<EOS>
the
supernatural
character
of
the
horseman
be
manifest
,
inasmuch
as
no
sound
be
cause
by
the
tread
of
his
steed
,
nor
do
he
appear
to
be
visible
to
Crouch
when
the
latter
look
back
.
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
maintain
her
seat
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
She
well
know
who
be
her
companion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Soh
,
Alice
Nutter
,
"
say
the
horseman
at
length
,
in
a
low
deep
tone
,
"
you
have
choose
to
shut
yourself
up
in
a
narrow
cell
,
like
a
recluse
,
for
more
than
two
month
,
deny
yourself
all
sort
of
enjoyment
,
practise
severest
abstinence
,
and
pass
your
whole
time
in
useless
prayer
--
ay
,
useless
,
for
if
you
be
to
pray
from
now
till
doomsday

come
when
it
will
,
a
thousand
year
hence
,
or
to

morrow

it
will
not

when

sentence

little
of
it

now
be
of
service

you

You
would
then
see
the
folly
of
this
abject
conduct

humble
yourself
to
the
dust
only
to
be
spurn

Your

Mistress

<EOS>
"
I
will
never

with
this
holy
volume

which

my
present
safeguard

on
which
I

my
hope
of
salvation

your

<EOS>
no

I

him

you

I
command
you
in
Heaven

hence

to
tempt
me
no

<EOS>
as
the
word
be
utter
,
with
a
howl
of
rage
and
mortification
,
like
the
roar
of
a
wild
beast
,
the
dark
horseman
and
his
steed
vanish

<EOS>
alarm
by
the
sound
,
Crouch
stop
,
and
question
the
lady
as
to
its
cause
;
but
receive
no
satisfactory
explanation
from
her
,
he
bid
her
ride
quickly
on
,
affirm
it
must
be
the
boggart
of
the
clough

<EOS>
soon
after
this
they
again
come
upon
Downham
beck
,
and
be
about
to
cross
it
,
when
their
purpose
be
arrest
by
a
joyous
barking
,
and
the
next
moment
Grip
come
up
.

the

up
in

other
to
get
out

he
have
scent
his

course
,
and
in
the
end
overtake
him
.
<EOS>
Crouch
do
not
know
whether
to
be
angry
or
pleased
,
and
at
first
give
utterance
to
an
oath
,
and
raise
his
whip
to
chastise
him
,
but
almost
instantly
the
latter
feeling
predominate
,
and
he
welcome
the
faithful
animal
with
a
few
kind
word

<EOS>
"

"
 
<EOS>
They
be
now
across
the
beck
,
and
speed
over
the
wide
brown
waste
.
<EOS>
the
huntsman
warily
shape
his
course
so
as
to
avoid
any
limestone
-
quarry
or
turf
-
pit
.
<EOS>
He
point
out
a
jack
-
o'-lantern
dance
merrily
on
the
surface
of
a
dangerous
morass
,
and
tell
a
dismal
tale
of
a
traveller
lure
into
it
by
the
delusive
light
,
and
swallow
up
.
 
<EOS>
Mistress
Nutter
pay
little
heed
to
him
,
but
ever
and
anon
look
back
,
as
if
in
dread
of
some
one
behind
her
.
<EOS>
but
no
one
be
visible
,
and
she
only
see
the
great
black
cloud
still
hover
over
Pendle
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
on
--
on
--
they
go
;
their
horse
'
hoofs
now
splash
through
the
wet
sod
,
now
beat
upon
the
firm
but
elastic
turf
.
<EOS>
a
merry
ride
it
would
be
if
their
errand
be
different
,
and
their
heart
free
from
care
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
fresh
and
revive
,
and
the
rapid
motion
exhilarating
.
<EOS>
the
star
shine
out
,
and
the
crescent
moon
be
still
glitter
in
the
heavens
,
but
the
black
cloud
hang
motionless
on
Pendle
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
now
<EOS>
and
then
some
bird
of
night
fly
past
them
,
and
they
hear
the
whooping
of
the
owl
,
and
see
him
skim
like
a
ghost
over
the
waste
.
<EOS>
then
more
fen
fire
arise
,
show
that
other
treacherous
quagmire
be
at
hand
;
but
Crouch
skirt
them
safely
.
<EOS>
now
the
bull
-
frog
croak
in
the
marsh
,
and
a
deep
booming
tell
of
a
bittern
passing
by
.
<EOS>
They
see
the
mighty
bird
above
them
,
with
his
wide
heavy
wing
and
long
neck
.
<EOS>
grip
howl
at
him
,
but
be
instantly
check
by
his
master
,
and
they
gallop
on
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
now
by
the
side
of
Pendle
Water
,
and
within
sight
of
Rough
Lee
.
<EOS>
what
tumultuous
thought
agitate
the
lady
's
breast
!
<EOS>
the
ground
she
trample
on
be
once
her
own
;
the
wood
by
the
river
side
be
plant
by
her
;
the
mansion
before
her
once
own
her
as
mistress
,
and
now
she
dare
not
approach
it
.
<EOS>
nor
do
she
desire
to
do
so
,
for
the
sight
of
it
bring
back
terrible
recollection
,
and
fill
her
again
with
despair
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
now
close
upon
it
,
and
it
appear
dark
,
silent
,
and
desert
.
<EOS>
how
different
from
what
it
be
of
yore
in
her
husband
's
day
--
the
husband
she
have
foully
slay
!
<EOS>
speed
on
,
old
huntsman!--lash
your
pant
horse
,
or
the
remorseful
lady
will
far
outstrip
you
,
for
she
ride
as
if
the
avenging
fury
be
at
her
heel
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
rattle
over
the
bridge
,
and
<EOS>
Crouch
,
toil
after
her
,
and
with
Grip
toil
after
him
,
shout
to
her
to
moderate
her
pace
.
<EOS>
She
look
back
,
and
behold
the
grim
old
house
frown
full
upon
her
,
and
hurry
on
.
<EOS>
Huntsman
and
dog
be
leave
behind
for
awhile
,
but
the
steep
ascent
soon
compel
her
to
slacken
speed
,
and
they
come
up
,
Crouch
swear
lustily
,
and
Grip
,
with
his
tongue
out
of
his
mouth
,
<EOS>
limp
as

sore
.
 
<EOS>
the
road
now
lead
through
a
thicket
.
<EOS>
the
horse
stumble
frequently
,
for
the
stone
be
loose
,
and
the
footing
consequently
uncertain
.
<EOS>
Crouch
have
a
fall
,
and
ere
he
can
remount
the
lady
be
go
.
<EOS>
It
be
useless
to
hurry
after
her
,
and
he
be
proceed
slowly
,
when
Grip
,
who
be
a
little
in
advance
,
growl
fiercely
,
and
look
back
at
his
master
,
as
if
to
intimate
that
danger
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
the
huntsman
press
on
,
but
he
be
too
late
,
if
,
indeed
,
he
could
at
any
time
have
render
effectual
assistance

by
several

<EOS>
part
of
the
band
bear
her
shriek
off
,
and
the
rest
fire
at
him
,
but
without
effect
,
and
then
chase
him
as
far
as
the
steep
part
of
the
hill
,
down
which
he
dash
,
follow
by
Grip
.
<EOS>
arrive
at
the
bottom
,
he
pause
to
listen
if
he

,
and
hear
nothing
further
to
alarm
him
,
debate
with
himself
what
be
good
to
be
do
;
and
,
not
like
to
alarm
the
village
,
for
that
would
be
to
betray
Mistress
Nutter
,
he
get
off
his
horse
,
tie
him
to
a
tree
,
and
with
Grip
close
at
his
heel
,
commence
the
ascent
of
the
hill
by
a
different
road
from
that
he
have
previously

<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Mistress
Nutter

forcibly
towards
the
tower

<EOS>
Their
arm
and
appearance
leave
her
no
doubt
they
be
depredator
,
and
she
seek
to
convince
them
she
have
neither
money
nor
valuable
in
her
possession
.
<EOS>
They
laugh
at
her
assertion
,
but
make
no
other
reply
.
<EOS>
Her
sole
consolation
be
,
that
they
do
not
seek
to
deprive
her
of
her
Bible

upon

<EOS>
there

something
in
the
man

truculent
physiognomy
,
and
strange
and
oblique
vision

that
remind
her
of
Mother

"

<EOS>
the

my

till
lately
Northumberland

the

but
chance
to
hear
of
my
worthy
old
mother

death

I
think
we
could
not
do
better
than
take
possession
of
her
stronghold
,
which
devolve
upon
me
by
right
of
inheritance

<EOS>
since
our
arrival
here
we

take
us

psalm

singing

pleasant

all

I

I

precisely

I

the

I

to

Demdike

I

gentle

too
tender

hearted

<EOS>
You
must
get

a

you

long

<EOS>
the
dungeon
be
dark
and
unwholesome
,
and
my
band
be
apt
to
be
harsh
in
their
treatment
of
captive

<EOS>
They
have
find
in
the
vault
some
instrument
of
torture
belong
to
old
Blackburn
,
the
freebooter

the
efficacy
of
which
in
an
obstinate
case
I
fear
they
may
be
incline
to
try

<EOS>
You
now
begin
to
see
the
drift
of
my

you

barbarous
fellow

inhuman

jocularity

<EOS>

It
may
put
an
end

discussion

Mistress

morning
in
August
,
Nicholas
Assheton
and
Richard
Sherborne

forth
together
from
the
proud
town
of
Preston
.
<EOS>
both
be
gaily
attire
in
doublet
and
hose
of
yellow
velvet
,
slash
with
white
silk

with
mantle
to
match
,

somewhat
conspicuously
embroidered
on
the
shoulder
with
a
wild
bull
work
in
gold
,
and
underneath
it
the
motto
,
"
_

<EOS>
follow
at
a
respectful
distance
by
four
mounted

the
two
gentleman

cross
the
bridge
over
the
Ribble
,
and
be
wend
their
way
along
the
bank
of
a
tributary
stream
,
the
Darwen
,
within
a
short
distance
of
the
charming
village
of
Walton
-
le

Dale
,
when
they
perceive
a
horseman
advance
slowly
towards
them
,
whom
they
instantly
hail
as
Richard
Assheton
,
and
push
forward
,
be
soon
beside
him
.
<EOS>
both
be
much
shock
by
the
young
man
's
haggard
look
,
and
inquire
anxiously
as
to
his
health
,
but
Richard
bid
them
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
,
not
be
uneasy
,
for
all
would
be
well
with
him
erelong
.
 
<EOS>
"
all
will
be
over
with
you
,
lad
,
if
you
do
not
mind
;
and
that
be
,
perhaps
,
what
you
mean
<EOS>
,
"
reply
Nicholas
;
"
but
as
soon
as
the
royal
festivity
at
Hoghton
be
over
,
I
will
set
about
your
cure
;
and
,
what
be
more
,
I
will
accomplish
it
--
for
I
know
where
the
seat
of
the
disease
lie
better
than
Dr.
Morphew
,
your
family
physician
at
Middleton
.
'
<EOS>
Tis

in
a
suit
of
sable
velvet
,
with
a
black
spanish
hat
and
feather
,
for
a
festival
!
<EOS>
You
look
as

to
a
funeral

I
be
fearful
his
Majesty
may
take
it
amiss
.
<EOS>
why

wear
the
livery
of
our
house
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay

rejoin
Richard
,
"
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
and
Sherborne
wear
it
,
instead
of
flaunt
like
daw
in
borrow
plumage
?
<EOS>
I
scarce
know
you
in
your
strange
garb
,
and
certainly
should
not
take
you
for
an
Assheton
,
or
aught
pertain
to
our
family
,
from
your
gaudy
colour
and
the
strange
badge
on
your
shoulder
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wonder
at
it
,
Dick
,

say
Nicholas
;
<EOS>
"
I
scarce
know
myself
;
and
though
the
clothe
I
wear
be
well
make
enough
,
they
seem
to
sit
awkwardly
on
me
,
and
trouble
me
as
much
as
the
shirt
of
Nessus
do
Hercules
of
old

,
though

man

desire
any
violation

somewhat
puritanically
inclined

I

still

"
 
<EOS>
"
have
no
misgiving

if

give
you
all
I
can

for
I
feel

observe
the

rest

I
have
reason

be
in

"
They

echo
Nicholas

if
he
<EOS>
I
grant
this

he
will
prove
himself
their

for
he

I
have
all

"
 
<EOS>
"
little
harm
will
ensue

for
he
will
be
cheer

protect
by
the
prayer

"
 
<EOS>
They
then
ride
on
for
a
few
minute
in
silence
,
after
which
;
Richard
inquired--
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
brave
doing

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
ay

answer
the
squire

and
the
feasting
must
have
cost
Ned
Tyldesley
a
pretty
penny
.
<EOS>
besides
the
King
and
his
own
particular
attendant
,
there
be
some
dozen
nobleman
and
their
follower
,
include
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
who
move
about
like
a
king
himself
,
and
I
know
not
how
many
knight
and
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Sherborne
and
I
ride
over
from
Dunnow
,
and
reach
the
forest
immediately
after
the
King
have
enter
it
in
his
coach
;
so
we
take
a
short
cut
through
the
wood
,
and
come
up
just
in
time
to
join
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
's
train
as
he
be
ride
up
to
his
Majesty
.
<EOS>
fancy
a
wide
glade
,
down
which
a
great
gild
coach
be
slowly
move
,
draw
by
eight
horse
,
and
follow
by
a
host
of
nobleman

gentleman
in
splendid
apparel
,
their
esquire
and
page
equally
richly
array
,
and
equally
well
mount
;
and
,
after
these
,
numerous
falconer
,
huntsman
,
pricker
,
forester
,
and
yeoman
,
with
staghound
in
leash
,
and
hawk
on
fist
,
all
ready
for
the
sport
.
<EOS>
fancy
all
this
if
you
can

Dick
,
and
then
conceive
what
a
brave
sight
it
must
have
be
.
<EOS>
well
,
as
I
say
,
we
come
up
in
the
very
nick
of
time
,
for
presently
the
royal
coach
stop
,
and
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
call
all
his
gentleman
around
him
,
and
bid
us
dismount
,
and
we
follow
him
,
and
draw
up
,
bareheade
,
before
the
King
,
while
Sir
Richard
point
out
to
his
Majesty
the
boundary
of
the
royal
forest
,
and
tell
him
he
would
find
it
as
well
stock
with
deer
as
any
in
his
kingdom

<EOS>
before
put
an
end
to
the
conference
,
the
King
compliment
the
worthy
Knight
on
the
gallant
appearance
of
his
train

on
learn
we
be
all
gentleman

graciously
signify
his
pleasure
that
some
of
us
should
be
present
to
him
.
<EOS>
amongst
other
,
I
be
bring
forward
by
Sir
Richard
,
and
like
my
look
,
I
suppose
,
the
King
be
condescend
enough
to
enter
into
conversation
with
me
;
and
as
his
discourse
chiefly
turn
on
sporting
matter
,
I
be
at
home
with
him
at
once
,
and
he
presently
grow
so
familiar
with
me
,
that
I
almost
forget
the
presence
in
which
I
stand
.
<EOS>
however
,
his
Majesty
seem
in
no
way
offend
by
my
freedom

but
,
on
the
contrary
,
clap
me
on

shoulder

after

mount

They

throw

to
an

he
vouchsafe
not
a

quickly

It

word

give
that
the

about
to

domestic
chapel

<EOS>
upon
this

an
immediate
rush

in
that
direction
by
the
crowd
;
but
the
great
part
be
keep
back
by
the
guard

who
cross
their
halbert
to
prevent
their
ingress

and
a
few
only

the
whole
Court

present
,
this
be
a
great
disappointment
to

<EOS>
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
two
very
courtly
personage

allow
a
passage
for

<EOS>
Nicholas

Richard
in

whisper
that
the
foremost
and
stately
of
the
two

Lord
Stanhope

Harrington
,

chamberlain

the
other

handsome

slight
figure
and
somewhat
libertine
expression
of
countenance
,
be
the
renowned
Sir
John
Finett
,
master
of
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
licentiousness
,
however
,
which
be
the
vice
of
the
age
and
the
stain
of
the
court
,
Sir
John
be
a
man
of
wit
and
address
,
and
perfectly
conversant
with
the
duty
of
his
office

of
which
he

leave
satisfactory
evidence
in
an
amusing
tractate

"
 
<EOS>
some
little
time
elapse
before
the
King
make
his
appearance
,
during
which
the
curiosity
of
such
as
have
not
see
him
,
as
be
the
case
with
Richard
,
be
greatly
excited
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
wonder
whether
the
pedantic
monarch
,
whose
character
perplex
the
shrewd
,
would
answer
his
preconceived
notion
,
and
whether
it
would
turn
out
that
his
portrait
be
like
him
.
<EOS>
while
these
thought
be
pass
through
his
mind
,
a
shuffling
noise
be
hear
without
,
and
King
James
appear
at
the
doorway
.
<EOS>
He
pause
there
for
a
moment
to
place
his
plumed
and
jewel
cap
upon
his
head
,
and
to
speak
a
word
with
Sir
John
Finett
,
and
during
this
Richard
have
an
opportunity
of
observe
him
.
<EOS>
the
portrait
_
be
_
like
,
but
the
artist
have
flatter
him
,
though
not
much
.
<EOS>
there
be
great
shrewdness
of
look
,
but
there
be
also
a
vacant
expression
,
which
seem
to
contradict
the
idea
of
profound
wisdom
generally
ascribe
to
him
.
<EOS>
when
in
perfect
repose
,
which
they
be
not
for
more
than
a
minute
,
the
feature
be
thoughtful
,
benevolent
,
and
pleasing
,
and
Richard
begin
to
think
him
quite
handsome
,
when
another
change
be
work
by
some
remark
of
Sir
John
Finett
.
<EOS>
as
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
tell
his
tale
,
the
King
's
fine
dark
eye
blaze
with
an
unpleasant
light
,
and
he
laugh
so
loudly
and
indecorously
at
the
close
of
the
narrative
,
with
his
great
tongue
hang
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
tear
run
down
his
cheek
,
that
the
young
man
be
quite
sicken
.
<EOS>
the
King
's
face
be
thin
and
long
,
the
cheek
shave
,
but
the
lip
clothe
with
mustache
,
and
a
scanty
beard
cover
his
chin
.
<EOS>
the
hair
be
brush
away
from
the
face
,
and
the
cap
place
at
the
back
of
the
head
,
so
as
to
exhibit
a
high
bald
forehead
,
of
which
he
be
prodigiously
vain
.
<EOS>
James
be
fully
equip
for
the
chase

a
green
silk

and
slightly

down
on

attire
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
majestic
,
but
the
very
reverse
,
in
the
King
's
deportment
,
and
he
seem
only
keep
upright
by
the
exceed
stiffness
of
his
cumbersome
clothe
.
<EOS>
with
the
appearance
of
be
corpulent
,
he
be
not
so
in
reality
,
and
his
weak

He

great
contrast

<EOS>
Sir

by
a
smart
slap
on
the
shoulder
from
Sir
John
Finett
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
ponder
over
the
masque
,
Master
Nicholas

thinking
of
the
petition

<EOS>
"

the

I
doubt
not

I
be
sure
,
for
I
know
the
king

sentiment
on
the
subject

<EOS>
but
touch
the
dame
,
Master
Nicholas
--
have
you
find
one
willing

able

take
part

<EOS>
"
I
have
find
several
willing

Sir

"
reply
Nicholas
;
"
but
as
to
their
ability
that
be
another
question
.
<EOS>
however
,
one
of
them
may
do
as
a
make
-
shift
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
in

base
court

shall
wait
on
you
when
you
please

then
you
can
make
your

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
far
well
,
"
reply
Finett
;
"
it
may
be
that
we
shall
have
Ben
Jonson
here
to
-
day
--
rare
Ben
,
the
prince
of
poet
and
masque
-
writer
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
expect
him
.
<EOS>
Ben
be
prepare
a

for
Christmas
,
to

call
'
the
Vision

Delight

'
in
which
his
highness
the
prince
be
to

a
principal
actor

some
verse
which

"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
singular
pleasure
to
me
to
see
him
,
"
say
Nicholas
;
"
for
I
hold
Ben
Jonson
in
the
high
esteem
as
a
poet
--
ay
,
above
them
all
,
unless
it
be
Will
Shakspeare

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
you
do
well
to
except
Shakspeare
,
"
rejoin
Sir
John
Finett
.
<EOS>
"
great
as
Ben
Jonson
be
,
and
for
wit
and
learn
no
man
surpass
him
,
he
be
not
to
be
compare
with
Shakspeare
,
who
for
profound
knowledge
of
nature
,
and
of
all
the
high
quality
of
dramatic
art
,
be
unapproachable
.
<EOS>
but
ours
be
a
learn
court
,
Master
Nicholas
,
and
therefore
we
have
a
learn
poet
;
but
a
right
good
fellow
be
Ben
Jonson
,
and
<EOS>
a
boon
companion
,
though
somewhat
prone
to
sarcasm
,
as
you
will
find
if
you
drink
with
him
.
<EOS>
over
his
cup
he
will
rail
at
court
and
courtier
in
good
set
term
,
I
promise
you
,
and
I
myself
have
come
in
for
his
gibe
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
love
him
none
the
less
for
his
quip
,
for
I
know
it
be
his
humour
to
utter
them
,
and
so
overlook
what
in
another
and
less
deserving
person
I
should
assuredly
resent
.
<EOS>
but
be
not
that
young
man
,
who
be
now
go
forth
,
your
cousin
,
Richard
Assheton
?
<EOS>
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
the
King
have
have
a
strange
tale
whisper
in
his
ear
,
that
the
youth
have
be
bewitch
by
a
maiden
--
Alizon
Nutter
,
I
think
she
be
name
--
of
whom
he
be
enamour
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
truth
may
be
in
the
charge
,
but
the
youth
himself
seem
to
warrant
it
,
for
he
look
ghastly
ill
.
<EOS>
a
letter
be
send
to
his
Majesty
at
Myerscough
,
communicate
this
and
certain
other
particular
with
which
I
be
not
acquaint
;
but
I
know
they
relate
to
some
professor
of
the
black
art
in
your
country
,
the
soil
of
which
seem
favourable
to
the
growth
of
such
noxious
weed
,
and
at
first
he
be
much
disturb
by
it
,
but
in
the
end
decide
that
both
party
should
be
bring
hither
without
be
make
aware
of
his
design
,
that
he
may
see
and
judge
for
himself
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
accordingly
a
messenger
be
send
over
to
Middleton
Hall
as
from
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
invite
the
whole
family
to
the
Tower
,
and
give
Sir
Richard
Assheton
to
understand
it
be
the
King
's
pleasure
<EOS>
he
should
bring
with
him
a
certain
young
damsel
,
name
Alizon
Nutter

of

mention
have

<EOS>
Sir

no
choice

His

conjecture

the
deep
baying
of
a
bloodhound

<EOS>
"
aha
!
<EOS>
they
have
rouse
him
,
"
cry
the
King
,
joyfully
place
his
own
bugle
to
his
lip
,
and
sound
an
answer
.
<EOS>
upon
this
the
whole
company
halt
in
anxious
expectation
,
the
hound
bay
loudly
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
,
a
noble
hart
burst
from
the
wood
,
whence
he
have
be
drive
by
the
shout
of
Nicholas
and
the
chief
huntsman
,
both
of
whom
appear
immediately
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
my
faith
!
<EOS>
a
great
hart
as
ever
be
hunt
,
"
exclaim
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
there
boy
,
there
!
<EOS>
to
him
!
<EOS>
to
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
dash
after
the
fly
hart
,
the
hound
make
the
welkin
ring
with
their
cry
.
<EOS>
many
lovely
damsel
be
there
,
but
none
think
of
the
cruelty
of
the
sport
--
none
sympathise
with
the
noble
animal
they
be
run
to
death
.
<EOS>
the
cry
of
the
hound
--
now
loud
and
ringing
--
now
deep
and
dole
,
accompany
by
the
whooping
of
the
huntsman
,
form
a
stirring
concert
,
which
find
a
response
in
many
a
gentle
bosom
.
<EOS>
the
whole
cavalcade
be
spread
widely
about
,
for
none
be
allow
to
ride
near
the
King
.
<EOS>
over
the
plain
they
scour
,
fleet
as
the
wind
,
and
the
hart
seem
make
for
a
fell
,
form
part
of
the
hill
near
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
but
ere
he
reach
it
,
the
relay
station
within
a
covert
burst
forth
,
and
,
turn
him
aside
,
he
once
more
dashed
fleetly
across
the
broad
expanse
,
as
if
about
to
return
to
his
old
lair
.
<EOS>
now
he
be
see
plunge
into
some
bosky
dell
;
and
,
after
be
lose
to
view
for
a
moment
,
bound
up
the
opposite
bank
,
and
stretch
across
a
tract
thickly
cover
with
fern
.
<EOS>
here
he
gain
upon
the
hound
,
who
be
lose
in
the
green
wilderness
,
and
their
cry
be
hush
for
a
brief
space
--
but
anon
they
burst
forth
anew
,
and
the
pack
be
soon
again
in
full
cry
,
and
speed
over
the
open
ground
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
the
cavalcade
have
keep
pretty
well
together
,
but
on
the
return
the
case
be
very
different
;
and
many
of
the
dame
,
be
unable
to
keep
up
with
the
hound
,
fall
off
,
and
,
as
a
natural
consequence
,
many
of
the
gallant
linger
behind
,
too
.
<EOS>
thus
only
the
keen
huntsman
hold
on
.
<EOS>
amongst
these
,
and
about
fifty
yard
behind
the
King
,
be
Richard
and
Nicholas
.
<EOS>
the
squire
be
right
when
he
predict
that
the
hart
would
show
them
good
sport
.
<EOS>
plunge
into
the
wood
,
the
hard
-
press
beast
knock
up
another
stag
,
and
take
possession
of
his
lair
,
but
be
speedily
rouse
again
by
Nicholas
and
the
chief
huntsman
.
<EOS>
once
more
he
be
cross
the
wide
plain
,
with
hound
and
huntsman
after
him
--
once
more
he
be
turn
by
a
new
relay
;
but
this
time
he
shape
his
course
towards
the
wood
skirt
the
Darwen
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
piteous
sight
to
see
him
now
;
his
coat
black
and
glisten
with
sweat
,
his
mouth
emboss
with
foam
,
<EOS>
his
eye
dull
,
big
tear
course
down
his
cheek
,
and
his
noble
head
carry
low
.
<EOS>
His
end
seem
nigh
--
for
the
hound
,
though
weary
too
,
redouble
their
energy
,
and
the
monarch
cheer
them
on
.
<EOS>
again
the
poor
beast
erect
his
head
--
if
he
can
only
reach
yon
coppice
he
be
safe
.
<EOS>
despair
nerve
him
,
and
with
gigantic
bound
he
clear
the
intervene
space
,
and
disappear
beneath
the
branch
.
<EOS>
quickly
as
the
hound
come
after
him
,
they
be
at
fault
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
take
to
the
soil
,
sire
,
"
cry
Nicholas
come
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
the
river
--
to
the
river
!
<EOS>
You
may
see
by
the
broken
branch
he
have
go
this
way
.
"
 
<EOS>
force
his
way
through
the
wood
,
James
be
soon
on
the
bank
of
the
Darwen
,
which
here
run
deep
and
slow
.
<EOS>
the
hart
be
nowhere
to
be
see
,
nor
be
there
any
slot
on
the
further
side
to
denote
that
he
have
go
forth
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
,
therefore
,
that
he
have
swam
down
the
stream
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
a
shout
be
hear
a
hundred
yard
low
down
,
proceed
from
Nicholas
;
and
,
ride
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
the
King
find
the
hart
at
bay
on
the
further
side
of
the
stream
,
and
nearly
up
to
his
haunch
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
the
King
regard
him
for
a
moment
anxiously
.
<EOS>
the
poor
animal
be
now
in
his
last
extremity
,
but
he
seem
determined
to
sell
his
life
dearly
.
<EOS>
He
stand
on
a
bank
project
into
the
stream
,
round
which
the
water
flow
deeply
,
and
could
not
be
approach
without
difficulty
and
danger
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
gore
several
hound
,
whose
bleed
body
be
sweep
down
the
current
;
and
,
though
the
other
bay
round
him
,
they
do
not
dare
to
approach
him
,
and
could
not
get
behind
him
,
as
a
high
bank
arise
in
his
rear
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
I
your
Majesty
's
permission
to
despatch
him
?
"
ask
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay

if
you

"
reply
James

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Nicholas
,
however
,
heed
not
the
caution
,
but
,
draw
his
wood

knife
,
and
disencumber
himself
of
his
cloak
,
he
plunge
into
the
stream
,
and
with
one
or
two
stroke
reach
the
bank

<EOS>
the
hart
watch
his
approach
,
as
if
divine
his
purpose
,
with
a
look
half
menacing
,
half
reproachful
,
and
when
he
come
near
,
dash
his
antlered
head
at
him
.
<EOS>
nimbly
elude
the
blow
,
which

if
it
have
take
effect

may
have
prove
serious

his
weapon
into

poor
brute

a
heavy
splash
into

<EOS>
as

afterwards

for
the
monarch

as
he

to
the
common
superstition

have

before

<EOS>
Sir

Sir
Thomas
Hoghton

in
close
attendance
upon
the
monarch
,
and

his

but
several
of
the
noble
and
gentleman
stretch
themselves
on
the
sward
,
and
address
themselves
to
the
viand
set
before
them
by

page

<EOS>
none
of
the
dame

and
few
could

any
refreshment

<EOS>
besides

two
barrel
of

the

and
well
calculated

gratify
one
so
fond
of
silvan
sport
as
the
monarch
for
whom
it

<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
this
tranquillity
and
enjoyment
an
incident
occur
which
interrupt
it
as
completely
as
if
a
thunder

storm

<EOS>
just
when

a

crashing
of

<EOS>
all
start
to
their
foot
at
the
appalling
sound
,
and
the
King
himself
turn
pale
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
in

it
be
,
Sir
Richard

"
<EOS>
he
inquire
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be

the
baronet
,
tremble

<EOS>
"
wild

"
<EOS>
ejaculate
James
,
in
great
alarm
;
"

<EOS>
we

<EOS>
Sir

,
ye

thus

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
unable
to
account
for
it
,

"
stammer
the
frightened
baronet
.
<EOS>
"
I
give

"
 
<EOS>
"

the
monarch

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
eh
!
<EOS>
what
be
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
amidst
all
this
consternation
and
confusion
the
bellowing
be
redouble
,
and
the
crashing
of
branch
draw
near
and
nearer
,
and
Nicholas
Assheton
rush
forward
with
the
King
's
horse
,
say
,
"
Mount
,
sire
;
mount
,
and
away
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
James
be
so
much
alarm
that
his
limb
refuse
to
perform
their
office
,
and
he
be
unable
to
put
foot
in
the
stirrup
.
<EOS>
see
his
condition
,
Nicholas
cry
out
,
"
Pardon
,
my
liege
;
but
at
a
moment
of
peril
like
the
present
,
one
must
not
stand
on
ceremony
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
take
the
King
round
the
waist
,
and
place
him
on
his
steed
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
,
a
loud
cry
be
hear
,
and
a
man
in
extremity
of
terror
issue
from
the
wood
,
and
dash
towards
the
hollow
.
<EOS>
close
on
his
heel
come
the
drove
of
wild
cattle
,
and
,
just
as
he
gain
the
very
verge
of
the
descent
,
the
foremost
of
the
herd
overtook
him
,
and
lower
his
curled
head
,
catch
him
on
the
point
of
his
horn
,
and
throw
him
forwards
to
such
a
distance
that
he
alight
with
a
heavy
crash
almost
at
the
King
's
foot
.
<EOS>
satisfied
,
apparently
,
with
their
vengeance
,
or
alarm
by
the
numerous
assemblage
,
the
drove
instantly
turn
tail
and
be
pursue
into
the
depth
of
the
forest
by
the
pricker
.
 
<EOS>
have
recover
his
composure
,
James
bid
some
of
the
attendant
raise
the
poor
wretch
,
who
be
lie
groan
upon
the
ground
,
evidently
so
much
injure
as
to
be
unable
to
move
without
assistance
.
<EOS>
His
garb
be
that
of
a
forester
,
and
his
bulk
--
for
he
be
stoutly
and
squarely
build
--
have
contribute
,
no
doubt
,
to
the
severity
of
the
fall
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
lift
from
the
ground
,
Nicholas
instantly
recognise
in
his
blacken
and
distorted
feature
those
of
Christopher
Demdike

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
he
exclaim

rush
towards
him

"

<EOS>
the
sufferer
only
reply
by
a
look
of
intense
malignity

<EOS>
"
eh

James

"
no

he
be
fearful

if
they

long

some

indeed

through

he

<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
mummer
arrive
in
front
of
the
King
,
the
dance
begin
.
<EOS>
with
their
sword
hold
upright
,
the
party
take
hand
and
wheel
rapidly
round
the
plough
,
keep
time
to
a
merry
measure
play
by
the
piper
,
who
still
maintain
his
seat
.
<EOS>
suddenly
the
ring
be
enlarge
to
double
its
former
size
,
each
man
extend
his
sword
to
his
neighbour
,
who
take
hold
of
the
point
;
after
which
an
hexagonal
figure
be

,
all
the
blade
be
bring
together
.
<EOS>
the
sword
be
then
quickly

,
flash
like
sunbeam
,
and
a
four
square
figure
be
present
,
the

actively
over
each
other

head
.
<EOS>
other
variation

,
not
necessary
to
be

--
and
the
sport
conclude
by
a
general
clashing
of
sword
,
intend
to
represent
a
melee
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Nicholas
have
be
join
by
Richard
Assheton
,
and
the
latter
be
not
long
in
detect
the
two
Devices
through
their
disguise
.
<EOS>
on
make
this
discovery
he
mention
it
to
the
squire
,
and
be
surprised
to
find
him
already
aware
of
the
circumstance
,
and
not
less
astonished
when
he
be
advise
to
let
them
alone
;
the
squire
add
he
be
unable
at
that
time
to
give
his
reason
for
such
counsel
,
but
,
be
good
and
conclusive
<EOS>
,
Richard
would
be
satisfied
of
their
propriety
hereafter
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
,
however
,
think
otherwise
,
and
,
notwithstanding
his
relative
's
attempt
to
dissuade
him
,
announce
his
intention
of
cause
the
party
to
be
arrest
at
once
;
and
with
this
design
he
go
in
search
of
an
officer
of
the
guard
,
that
the
capture
may
be
effect
without
disturbance
.
<EOS>
but
the
throng
be
so
close
round
the
dancer
that
he
could
not
pierce
it
,
and
be
compel
to
return
and
take
another
course
,
he
get
near
to
the
mazy
ring
,
and
be
unceremoniously
push
aside
by
the
mummer
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
both
his
arm
be
forcibly
grasp
,
and
a
deep
voice
on
the
right
whisper
in
his
ear--"meddle
not
with
us
,
and
we
will
not
meddle
with
you
,
"
while
similar
counsel
be
give
him
in
other
equally
menacing
tone
,
though
in
a
different
key
,
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
Richard
would
have
shake
off
his
assailant
,
and
seize
them
in
his
turn
,
but
power
to
do
so
be
want
to
him
.
<EOS>
for
the
moment
he
be
deprive
of
speech
and
motion
;
but
while
thus
situate
he
feel
that
the
sapphire
ring
give
him
by
the
King
be
snatch
from
his
finger
by
the
first
speaker
,
whom
he
know
to
be
Jem
Device
,
while
a
fearful
spell
be
mutter
over
him
by
Elizabeth

<EOS>
as
this
occur
at
the
time
when
the
rattling
of

the
whole
attention
of
the
spectator
,
no

except
Nicholas

before

could
get
up

the
young

,
the
two
miscreant
be
go
,
nor
could
any
one
tell
what
have
become
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
the
wretch

you
a
mischief
?
<EOS>
"
ask
the
squire
,
in
a
low
tone
,
of
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
They

the
King

ring
,
which
I
mean
to
use

"
reply
the
young
man
,
who
by
this
time
have

his
speech
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
unlucky
,

Nicholas

<EOS>
the
time

<EOS>
"
the

do
not

round
,
for
he
well
know
that
<EOS>
the
caution
proceed
from
Nance
Redferne

<EOS>
and
,
accordingly
,
he

to
Richard--"Tarry
awhile

and
you
will

"
 
<EOS>
and
with
this
assurance
the
young
man
be
fain
to
be
content
.
 
<EOS>
just
then
a

and
a

the
summit
of
the
broad
flight
of

and
a

to

in

<EOS>
the
Duke

jester

an
obese
little
fellow
,
and
his
appearance
in
this
warlike

how
it
would
terminate

when

with
the
hilt

off
the
porringer

but
stretch
him
on

ground
beside

the
punishment

be
enough
for
poor
Davy

He

Archie

drollery
in

"
 
<EOS>
the
baronet
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
and
soon
afterwards
the
stage
be
occupy
by
a
new
class
of
performer
,
and
a
drollery
commence
which
keep
the
audience
in
one
continual
roar
of
laughter
so
long
as
it
last
.
<EOS>
and
yet
none
of
the
part
have
be
study
,
the
actor
entirely
trust
to
their
own
power
of
comedy
to
carry
it
out
.
<EOS>
the
principal
character
be
the
Cap
Justice
,
enact
by
Sir
John
Finett
,
who
take
occasion
in
the
course
of
the
performance
to
lampoon
and
satirise
most
of
the
eminent
legal
character
of
the
day
,
mimic
the
voice
and
manner
of
the
three
justice
--
Crooke
,
Hoghton
,
and
Doddridge
--
so
admirably
,
that
his
hearer
be
wellnigh
convulse
;
and
the
three
learn
gentleman
,
who
sit
near
the
King
,
though
fully
conscious
of
the
ridicule
apply
to
them
,
be
oblige
to
laugh
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
but
the
unspare
satirist
be
not
content
with
this
,
but
go
on
,
with
most
of
the
other
attendant
upon
the
King
,
and
be
intimately
verse
in
court
scandal
,
he
direct
his
lash
with
tell
effect
.
<EOS>
as
a
contrast
to
the
malicious
pleasantry
of
the
Cap
Justice
,
be
the
gambol
and
jest
of
Robin
Goodfellow
--
a
merry
imp
,
who
,
if
he
lead
people
into
mischief
,
be
always
ready
to
get
them
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
dance
by
Bill
Huckler
,
old
Crambo
,
and
Tom
o
<EOS>
'
Bedlam
,
the
half
-
craze
individual
already
mention
as
be
among
the
crowd
in
the
base
court
.
<EOS>
this
be
applaud
to
the
echo
,
and
consequently
repeat
.
<EOS>
but
the
most
diverting
scene
of
all
be
that
in
which
Jem
Tospot
and
the
three
Doll
Wangos
appear
.
<EOS>
though
give
in
the
broad
vernacular
of
the
county
,
and
scarcely
intelligible
to
the
whole
of
the
company
,
the
dialogue
of
this
part
of
the
piece
be
so
lifelike
and
natural
,
that
every
one
recognise
its
truth
;
while
the
situation
,
arrange
with
the
slight
effort
,
and
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
be
extremely
ludicrous
.
<EOS>
the
scene
be
suppose
to
take
place
in
a
small
Lancashire
alehouse
,
where
a
jovial
pedlar
be
carouse
,
and
where
,
be
visit
by
his
three
sweetheart
--
each
of
whom
he
privately
declare
to
be
the
favourite
--
he
have
to
reconcile
their
difference
,
and
keep
them
all
in
good
-
humour

<EOS>
familiar
with
the
character
in
all
its
aspect
,
Nicholas

it
to
the
life
;
and
,
to
do
them
justice
,
Dames
Baldwyn
,
Tetlow
,
and
Nance
Redferne
,
be
but
little
if
at
all
inferior
to
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
reality
in
their
jealous
quarrelling
that
give
infinite
zest
to
the
performance
.
 
<EOS>
"

CHAPTER
XI.--FATALITY
.
  
<EOS>
along
the
eastern
terrace
a
youth
and
maiden
be
pace
slowly
.
<EOS>
They
have
steal
forth
unperceived
from
the
revel
,
and
,
pass
through
a
door
stand
invitingly
open
,
have
enter
the
garden
.
<EOS>
though
overjoy
in
each
other
's
presence
,
the
solemn
beauty
of
the
night
,
so
powerful
in
its
contrast
to
the
riotous
scene
they
have
just
quit
,
profoundly
impress
them
.
<EOS>
above
,
be
the
deep
serene
heaven
,
light
up
by
the
starry
host
and
their
radiant
queen
--
below
,
the
immemorial
wood
,
steep
in
silvery
mist
arise
from
the
stream
flow
past
them
.
<EOS>
all
nature
be
hush
in
holy
rest
.
<EOS>
in
opposition
to
the
flood
of
soft
light
emanate
from
the
lovely
planet
overhead
,
and
which
turn
all
it
fall
on
,
whether
tree
,
or
tower
,
or
stream
,
to
beauty
,
be
the
artificial
glare
cause
by
the
torch
near
the
pavilion
;
while
the
discordant
sound
occasion
by
the
minstrel
tune
their
instrument
,
disturb
the
repose
.
<EOS>
as
they
go
on
,
however
,
these
sound
be
lose
in
the
distance
,
and
the
glare
of
the
torch
be
exclude
by
intervene
tree
.
<EOS>
then
the
moon
look
down
lovingly
upon
them
,
and
the
only
music
that
reach
their
ear
arise
from
the
nightingale
.
<EOS>
after
a
pause
,
they
walk
on
again
,
hand
-
in
-
hand
,
gaze
at
each
other
,
at
the
glorious
heavens
,
and
drink
in
the
thrill
melody
of
the
songster
of
the
grove
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
angle
of
the
terrace
be
a
small
arbour
place
in
the
midst
of
a
bosquet
,
and
they
sit
down
within
it
.
<EOS>
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
do
their
thought
find
vent
in
word
.
<EOS>
forget
the
sorrow
they
have
endure
,
and
the
peril
by
which
they
be
environ
,
they
find
in
their
deep
mutual
love
a
shield
against
the
sharp
arrow
of
fate
.
<EOS>
in
low
gentle
accent
they
breathe
their
passion
,
solemnly
plight
their
faith
before
all
-
see
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
they
be
happy
then
--
intensely
happy
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
that
their
happiness
should
be
so
short
;
for
those
few
moment
of
bliss
,
steal
from
a
waste
of
tear
,
be
all
that
be
allow
them
.
<EOS>
inexorable
fate
still
dog
their
footstep
.
 
<EOS>
amidst
the
bosquet
stand
a
listener
to
their
converse
--
a
little
girl
with
high
shoulder
and
sharp
feature
,
on
which
diabolical
malice
be
stamp
.
<EOS>
two
yellow
eye
glisten
through
the
leave
beside
her
,
mark
the
presence
of
a
cat
.
<EOS>
as
the
lover
breathe
their
vow
,
and
indulge
in
hope
never
to
be
realise
,
the
wicked
child
grin
,
clench
her
hand
,
and
,
grudge
them
their
short
-
live
happiness
,
seem
inclined
to
interrupt
it
.
<EOS>
some
strong
motive
,
however
,
keep
her
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
pair
talking
of
now?--She
hear
<EOS>
her
own
name
mention
by
the
maiden
,
who
speak
of
her
with
pity
,
almost
with
affection
--
pardon
her
for
the
mischief
she
have
do
her
,
and
hope
Heaven
will
pardon
her
likewise
.
<EOS>
but
she
know
not
the
full
extent
of
the
girl
's
malignity
,
or
even
her
gentle
heart
must
have
be
rouse
to
resentment
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
girl
,
however
,
feel
no
compunction
.
<EOS>
infernal
malice
have
take
possession
of
her
heart
,
and
crush
every
kindly
feeling
within
it
.
<EOS>
She
hate
all
those
that
compassionate
her
,
and
return

<EOS>
what
be
the
lover
talk
of
now
?
<EOS>
of
their
first
meeting
at
Whalley
Abbey
,
when
one
be
May
Queen
,
and
by
her
beauty
and
simplicity
win
the
other
's
heart
,
lose
her
own
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
a
bright
unclouded
career
seem
to
lie
before
them
then
.
<EOS>
wofully
have
it
darken
since
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
 
<EOS>
the
little
girl
smile
.
<EOS>
She
hope
they
will
go
on
.
<EOS>
She
like
to
hear
them
talk
thus
.
<EOS>
past
happiness
be
ever
remember
with
a
pang
by
the
wretched
,
and
they
_
be
_
happy
then
.
<EOS>
go
on
--
go
on
!
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
silent
for
awhile
,
for
they
wish
to
dwell
on
that
hopeful
,
that
blissful
season
.
<EOS>
and
a
nightingale
,
alight
on
a
bough
above
them
,
pour
forth
its
sweet
plaint
,
as
if
in
response
to
their
tender
emotion
.
<EOS>
They
praise
the
bird
's
song
,
and
it
suddenly
cease
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
little
girl
,
full
of
malevolence
,
stretch
forth
her
hand
,
and
it
drop
to
the
ground
,
as
if
stricken
by
a
dart
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
thy
heart
broken
,
poor
bird
?
"
exclaim
the
young
man
,
take
up
the
hapless
songster
,
yet
warm
and
palpitating
.
"
<EOS>
to
die
in
the
midst
of
thy
song--'tis
hard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
hard
!
<EOS>
"
reply
the
maiden
,
tearfully
.
"
<EOS>
Its
fate
seem
a
type
of
our
own
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
little
girl
laugh
,
but
in
a
low
tone
,
and
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
the
pair
then
grow
sad
.
<EOS>
this
slight
incident
have
touch
them
deeply
,
and
their
conversation
take
a
melancholy
turn
.
<EOS>
They
speak
of
the
blight
that
have
nip
their
love
in
the
bud
--
of
the
canker
that
have
eat
into
its
heart
--
of
the
destiny
that
so
relentlessly
pursue
them
,
threaten
to
separate
them
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
girl
laugh
merrily
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
speak
of
the
grave
--
and
of
hope
beyond
the
grave
;
and
they
speak
cheerfully
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
girl
could
laugh
no
longer
,
for
with
her
all
beyond
the
grave
be
despair
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
they
speak
of
the
terrible
power
that
Satan
have
lately
obtain
in
that
unhappy
district
,
of
the
art
he
have
employ
,
and
of
the
votary
he
have
win
.
<EOS>
both
pray
fervently
that
his
snare
may
be
circumvent
,
and
his
rule
destroy
.
 
<EOS>
during
this
part
of
the
discourse
the
cat
swell
to
the
size
of
a
tiger
,
and
his
eye
glow
like
fiery
coal
.
<EOS>
He
make
a
motion
as
if
he
would
spring
forward
,
but
the
voice
of
prayer
arrest
him
,
and
he
shrink
back
to
his
former
size
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Jennet
be
ensnare
by
the
Fiend
,
"
murmur
the
maiden
,
"
and
will
perish
eternally
.
<EOS>
Would
I
could
save
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
,
"
reply
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
beyond
redemption
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
little
girl
gnash
her
tooth
with
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
my
mother
--
I
do
not
now
<EOS>
despair
of
her
,
"
say
Alizon
.
<EOS>
"
She

and

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
exclaim
Richard

<EOS>
scarcely

<EOS>
"

cry
the
little

<EOS>
but
the
familiar

not

to
the
call

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
and
with
this
she
creep
stealthily
round
the
arbour
,
and
,
approach
the
side
where
Richard
sit
,
watch
an
opportunity
of
touch
him
unperceived
.
 
<EOS>
as
her
finger
come
in
contact
with
his
frame
,
a
pang
like
death
shoot
through
his
heart
,
and
he
fall
upon
Alizon

shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
gaze
at
his
pallid
feature
,
render
ghastly
white
by
the
moonlight

<EOS>
Richard
could
make
no

,
and
Alizon
,
become
dreadfully

,
be
about
to
fly
for

but

just
then
Richard
recover

but
his
word
be
faintly
utter

and
with
difficulty

<EOS>
"

she

<EOS>
and
as

his
strength
utterly
forsook
him
,
and
he
fall
backwards

"

she
cry
,
in
frenzied
tone
,
"
I
shall
thus
escape
my
enemy

and
avoid
the
horrible
and
shameful
death

and
she
snatch
the
dagger
from

<EOS>
"
now

"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
with
a
fearful
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
one
last
look
at
that
calm
beautiful
face
--
one
kiss
of
the
cold
lip
,
which
can
no

the
endearment

the
dagger

<EOS>
but
she
be
withhold
by
an
arm
of
iron

and
the
weapon
fall
from

<EOS>
She
look
up
.
<EOS>
a
tall
figure
,
clothe
in
the
mouldering
habiliment
of
a
cistertian
monk

stand
beside

She

and
the
feature
of
the
ghostly
monk
seem
familiar
to
her

<EOS>
"
raise
not

tone

awful
reproof

He

Alizon

gaze
at

with
wonder
rather

with
terror

who

<EOS>
"
the
enemy

I

"
Thou

"
 
<EOS>
"
with
that
assurance
I
will
go

reply
Alizon
,
with
a
last
look
at
the
object
of
her
love

"

"
It

<EOS>
and
he
glide
on
with
noiseless
footstep
.
 
<EOS>
Alizon
follow
him
along
the
terrace
.
 
<EOS>
presently
they
come
to
a
dark
yew
-
tree
walk
,
lead
to
a
labyrinth
,
and
track
it
swiftly
,
as
well
as
the
overarched
and
intricate
path
to
which
it
conduct
,
they
enter
a
grotto
,
whence
a
flight
of
step
descend
to
a
subterranean
passage
,
hew
out
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
along
this
passage
,
which
be
of
some
extent
,
the

proceed
,
and
Alizon
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
they
come
to
another
flight
of
step
,
and
here
the
monk
stop
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
now
beneath
the
pavilion

where
you

"
Mount

<EOS>
Alizon
obey
;
and
,
as
she
advance
,
be
surprised
to
find
the
monk
go
.
<EOS>
He
have
neither

chapter
XII.--THE
last
hour
.
  
<EOS>
within
the
pavilion
sit
Alice
Nutter
.
<EOS>
She
be
clothe
in
deep
mourning
,
but
her
dress
seem
disorder
as
if
by
hasty
travel
.
<EOS>
Her
look
be
full
of
anguish
and
terror
;
her
blanch
tress
,
once
so
dark
and
beautiful
,
hang
dishevel
over
her
shoulder
;
and
her
thin
hand
be
clasp
in
supplication
.
<EOS>
Her
cheek
be
ashy
pale
,
but
on
her
brow
be
a
bright
red
mark
,
as
if
trace
by
a
finger
dip
in
blood
.
 
<EOS>
a
lamp
be
burn
on
the
table
beside
her
.
<EOS>
near
it
be
a
skull
,
and
near
this
emblem
of
mortality
an
hourglass
,
run
fast
.
 
<EOS>
the
window
and
door
of
the
building
be
closed
,
and
it
would
seem
the
unhappy
lady
be
a
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
bring
there
secretly
that
night
,
with
what
intent
<EOS>
she
know
not
;
but
she
feel
sure
it
be
with
no
friendly
design
towards
herself
.
<EOS>
early
in
the
day
three
horseman
have
arrive
at
her
retreat
in
Pendle
Forest
,
and
without
make
any
charge
against
her
,
or
explain
whither
they
mean
to
take
her
,
or
indeed
answer
any
inquiry
,
have
bring
her
off
with
them
,
and
,
proceed
across
the
country
,
have
arrive
at
a
forester
's
hut
on
the
outskirt
of
Hoghton
Park
.
<EOS>
here
they
tarry
till
evening
,
place
her
in
a
room
by
herself
,
and
keep
strict
watch
over
her
;
and
when
the
shadow
of
night
fall
,
they
convey
her
through
the
wood
,
and
by
a
private
entrance
to
the
garden
of
the
Tower
,
and
with
equal
secresy
to
the
pavilion
,
where
,
set
a
lamp
before
her
,
they
leave
her
to
her
meditation
.
<EOS>
all
refuse
to
answer
her
inquiry
,
but
one
of
them
,
with
a
sinister
smile
,
place
the
hourglass
and
skull
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
leave
alone
,
the
wretched
lady
vainly
seek
some
solution
of
the
enigma
--
why
she
have
be
bring
thither
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
solve
it
;
but
she
determine
,
if
her
capture
have
be
make
by
any
lawful
authority
,
to
confess
her
guilt
and
submit
to
condign
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
window
and
door
be
close
as
before
mention
,
sound
from
without
reach
her
,
and
she
hear
confused
and
tumultuous
noise
as
if
from
a
large
assemblage
.
<EOS>
for
what
purpose
be
they
meet
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
for
her
execution
?
<EOS>
no
--
there
be
strain
of
music
,
and
burst
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
have
hear
that
the
burning
of
a
witch
be
a
spectacle
in
which
the
populace
delight
--
that
they
look
upon
it
as
a
show
,
like
any
other
;
and
why
should
they
not
laugh
,
and
have
music
at
it
?
<EOS>
but
could
she
be
execute
without
trial
,
without
judgment
?
<EOS>
She
know
not
.
<EOS>
all
she
know
be
she
be
guilty
,
and
deserve
to
die
.
<EOS>
but
when
this
idea
take
possession
of
her
,
the
laughter
sound
in
her
ear
like
the
yell
of
demon
,
and
the
strain
like
the
fearful
harmony
she
have
hear
at
weird
sabbath
.
 
<EOS>
all
at
once
she
recollect
with
indescribable
terror
,
that
on
this
very
night
the
compact

into
with
the
Fiend

<EOS>
that
at
midnight
,
unless
by
her
penitence
and
prayer
she
have
work
out
her
salvation
,
he
could
claim
her
.
<EOS>
She
recollect
also
,
and
with
increase
uneasiness
,
that
the
man
who
have
set
the
hourglass
on
the
table
,
and
who
have
regard
her
with
a
sinister
smile
as
he
do
so
,
have
say
it
be
eleven
o'clock
!
<EOS>
Her
last
hour
then
have
arrive

and
the
moment

pass
swiftly
by

<EOS>
the
agony
she
endure
at
this
thought
be
intense
.
<EOS>
She
feel
as
if
reason

her
,
and
,
but
for
her
determined
effort
to
resist
it
,
such
a
crisis
may
have
occur
.
<EOS>
but
she
know
that
her
eternal
welfare
depend
upon
the
preservation
of
her
mental
balance

and
she
strove
to
maintain
it
,
and
in
the
end
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
Her
gaze
be
fix
intently
on
the
hourglass
.
<EOS>
She
see
the
sand
trickle
silently
but
swiftly
down
,
like
a
current
of
life
-
blood
,
which
,
when
it
cease
,
life
would
cease
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
see
the
shine
grain
above
insensibly
diminish
in
quantity
,
and
,
as
if
she
could
arrest
her
destiny
by
the
act
,
she
seize
the
glass
,
and
would
have
turn
it
,
but
the
folly
of
the
proceeding
arrest
her
,
and
she
set
it
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
then
horrible
thought
come
upon
her
,
crush
her
and
overwhelm
her
,
and
she
feel
by
anticipation
all
the
torment
she
would
speedily
have
to
endure

<EOS>
a
hot
sulphureous
atmosphere
oppress

and
a

of

dim
her

<EOS>
She
endeavour
to
pray
,
but
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
Hell

and
with
new
torment

<EOS>
She
close
her
eye

<EOS>
She
shut
her
ear

<EOS>
but
she
see
it
still

and
hear
its
terrific

<EOS>
again
she

<EOS>
She

of

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
if
Alizon

She

she

<EOS>
no

she

again
she

<EOS>
one
quarter

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
a

<EOS>
She
see
a

she

<EOS>
Can

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
no

she
touch

It

She

on

GRAVE

"
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
sad
occurrence
above
detail
,
James
remain
for
two
more
day
the
guest
of
Sir
Richard
Hoghton
,
enjoy
his
princely
hospitality
,
hunt
in
the
park
,
carouse
in
the
great
hall
,
and
witness
all
kind
of
sport
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
,
indeed
,
be
leave
to
remind
him
of
the
sad
event
that
have
occur
.
<EOS>
the
prisoner
be
take
that
night
to
Lancaster
Castle
,
and
Master
Potts
accompany
the
escort
,
to
be
ready
for
the
assize
.
<EOS>
the
three
judge
proceed
thither
at
the
end
of
the
week
.
<EOS>
the
attendance
of
Roger
Nowell
,
Nicholas
,
and
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
be
also
require
as
witness
at
the
trial
of
the
witch
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Assheton
and
Dorothy
have
return
,
as
already
state
,
to
Middleton
;
and
,
though
the
intelligence
of
the
death
of
Richard
and
Alizon
be
communicate
to
them
with
infinite
caution
,
the
shock
to
both
be
very
great
,
especially
to
Dorothy
,
who
be
long
--
very
long
--
in
recover
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
's
vivacity
of
temperament
make
him
feel
the
loss
of
his
cousin
at
first
very
keenly
,
but
it
soon
wear
off
.
<EOS>
He
vow
amendment
and
reformation
on
the
model
of
John
Bruen
,
whose
life
offer
so
strike
a
contrast
to
his
own
,
that
it
have
very
properly
be
place
in
opposition
by
a
reverend
moralist
;
but
I
regret
to
say
that
he
do
not
carry
out
his
praiseworthy
intention
.
<EOS>
He
be
apt
to
make
a
joke
of
John
Bruen
,
instead
of
imitate
his
example
.
<EOS>
He
profess
to
devote
himself
to
his
excellent
wife
--
but
his
old
habit
would
break
out
;
and
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
he
be
often
to
be
find
in
the
alehouse
,
and
be
just
as
fond
of
horse
-
race
,
cock
-
fighting
,
hunting
,
fishing
,
and
all
other
sport
,
as
ever
.
<EOS>
occasionally
he
occupy
a
leisure
or
a
rainy
day
with
a
Journal,[6
]
<EOS>
part
of
which
have
be
preserve
;
but
he
set
down
in
it
few
of
the
terrible
event
here
relate
,
probably
because
they
be
of
too
painful
a
nature
to
be
record
.
<EOS>
He
die
in
1625
-
-at
the
early
age
of
thirty
-
five
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
the
tragical
event
at
Hoghton
Tower
,
the
whole
village
of
Whalley
be
astir
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
no
festive
occasion
--
no
merry
-
making
--
<EOS>
that
call
forth
the
inhabitant
,
for
grief
sit
upon
every
countenance
.
<EOS>
the
day
,
too
,
be
gloomy
.
<EOS>
the
feathered
summit
of
Whalley
Nab
be
wreathe
in
mist
,
and
a
fine
rain
descend
in
the
valley
.
<EOS>
the
Calder
look
dull
and
discolour
as
it
flow
past
the
wall
of
the
ancient
Abbey
.
<EOS>
the
church
bell
toll
mournfully
,
and
a
large
concourse
be
gather
in
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
not
far
from
one
of
the
three
crosse
of
Paulinus
,
which
stand
near
the
church
porch
,
a
grave
have
be
digge

and
almost
every
one
look
into
it
.
<EOS>
the
grave
,
it
be
say
,
be
intend
to
hold
two
coffin
.
<EOS>
soon
after
this
,
a
train
of
mourner
issue
from
the
ancient
Abbey
gateway
,
and
sure
enough
there
be
two
coffin

the
shoulder
of
the
bearer
;
They
be
meet
at
the
gate
by
Doctor
Ormerod
,
who
be
so
deeply
affected
as
scarcely
to
be
able
to
perform
the
needful
office
for
the
dead
.
<EOS>
the
principal
mourner
be
Sir
Richard
Assheton
of
Middleton
,
Sir
Ralph
Assheton
,
and
Nicholas

<EOS>
amid
the

sobs
of
all
the
bystander
,
the
body
of
Richard
and
Alizon
be
commit
to
the
earth

in
one
grave

<EOS>
thus
be
their
late
wish

<EOS>
flower
grow
upon
the
turf
that
cover
them
,
and
there
be
the
early
primrose

<EOS>
many
a
fond
youth
and
trust
maiden
have
visit
their
lowly
tomb
,
and
many
a
tear
,
fresh
from
the
heart
,

cover

<EOS>
It
be
the

<EOS>
at

She

<EOS>
on
issue

exceed
faintness

support

<EOS>
She
be
lead
towards
the
stake
in
this
state

but
she
grow
fainter

fainter

and
at
last
fall
back
in
the
arm
of
the
man
that
support
her
.
<EOS>
still
they
carry
her
on
.
<EOS>
when
the
executioner
put
out
his
hand
to
receive
her
from
his
aid
,
she
be
find
to

quite
dead

<EOS>
hundred
of
spectator
beheld
those
terrible
fire
,
and
exult
in
the
torment
of
the
miserable
sufferer
.
<EOS>
Their
shriek
and
blasphemy
be
terrific
,
and
the
place
resemble
a
hell
upon
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Jennet
escape
,
to
the
dismay
of
Master
Potts
,
who
fear
she
would
wreak
her
threaten
vengeance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
he
do
suffer
from
ache
and
cramp
,
which
he
attribute
to
her
;
but
which
be
more
reasonably
suppose
to
be
owe
to
rheum
catch
in
the
marsh
of
Pendle
Forest
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
the
pleasure
of
assist
at
her
execution
,
when
some
year
afterwards
retributive
justice
overtake
her
.
 
<EOS>
Jennet
be
the
last
of
the
Lancashire
Witches
.
<EOS>
ever
since
then
witchcraft
have
take
a
new
form
with
the
lady
of
the
county
--
though
their
fascination
and
spell
be
as
potent
as
ever
.
<EOS>
few
can
now
escape
them,--few
desire
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
to
all
who
be
afraid
of
a
bright
eye
and
a
bloom
cheek
,
and
who
desire
to
adhere
to
a
bachelor

condition

to
such
I

"
