the
STORY
BEGUN
by
<EOS>
WALTER
HARTRIGHT
  
(
of
Clement
's
Inn
,
teacher
of
draw
)
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
story
of
what
a
Woman
's
patience
can
endure
,
and
what
a
Man
's
resolution
can
achieve
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
machinery
of
the
Law
could
be
depend
on
to
fathom
every
case
of
suspicion
,
and
to
conduct
every
process
of
inquiry
,
with
moderate
assistance
only
from
the
lubricate
influence
of
oil
of
gold
,
the
event
which
fill
these
page
may
have
claim
their
share
of
the
public
attention
in
a
Court
of
Justice
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
Law
be
still
,
in
certain
inevitable
case
,
the
pre
-
engaged
servant
of
the
long
purse
;
and
the
story
be
leave
to
be
tell
,
for
the
first
time
,
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
as
the
Judge
may
once
have
hear
it
,
so
the
reader
shall
hear
it
now
.
<EOS>
no
circumstance
of
importance
,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
disclosure
,
shall
be
relate
on
hearsay
evidence
.
<EOS>
when
the
writer
of
these
introductory
line
(
Walter
Hartright
by
name
)
happen
to
be
more
closely
connected
than
other
with
the
incident
to
be
record
,
he
will
describe
them
in
his
own
person
.
<EOS>
when
his
experience
fail
,
he
will
retire
from
the
position
of
narrator
;
and
his
task
will
be
continue
,
from
the
point
at
which
he
have
leave
it
off
,
by
other
person
who
can
speak
to
the
circumstance
under
notice
from
their
own
knowledge
,
just
as
clearly
and
positively
as
he
have
speak
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
the
story
here
present
will
be
tell
by
more
than
one
pen
,
as
the
story
of
an
offence
against
the
law
be
tell
in
Court
by
more
than
one
witness
 
with
the
same
object
,
in
both
case
,
to
present
the
truth
always
in
its
most
direct
and
most
intelligible
aspect
;
and
to
trace
the
course
of
one
complete
series
of
event
,
by
make
the
person
who
have
be
most
closely
connected
with
them
,
at
each
successive
stage
,
relate
their
own
experience
,
word
for
word
.
  
<EOS>
let
Walter
Hartright
,
teacher
of
draw
,
aged
twenty
-
eight
year
,
be
hear
first
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
the
last
day
of
July
.
<EOS>
the
long
hot
summer
be
draw
to
a
close
;
and
we
,
the
weary
pilgrim
of
the
London
pavement
,
be
begin
to
think
of
the
cloud
-
shadow
on
the
corn
-
field
,
and
the
autumn
breeze
on
the
sea
-
shore
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
own
poor
part
,
the
fade
summer
leave
me
out
of
health
,
out
of
spirit
,
and
,
if
the
truth
must
be
tell
,
out
of
money
as
well
.
<EOS>
during
the
past
year
I
have
not
manage
my
professional
resource
as
carefully
as
usual
;
and
my
extravagance
now
limit
me
to
the
prospect
of
spend
the
autumn
economically
between
my
mother
's
cottage
at
Hampstead
and
my
own
chamber
in
town
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
,
I
remember
,
be
still
and
cloudy
<EOS>
;
the
London
air
be
at
its
heavy
;
the
distant
hum
of
the
street
-
traffic
be
at
its
faint
;
the
small
pulse
of
the
life
within
me
,
and
the
great
heart
of
the
city
around
me
,
seem
to
be
sink
in
unison
,
languidly
and
more
languidly
,
with
the
sink
sun
.
<EOS>
I
rouse
myself
from
the
book
which
I
be
dream
over
rather
than
read
,
and
leave
my
chamber
to
meet
the
cool
night
air
in
the
suburb
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
two
evening
in
every
week
which
I
be
accustomed
to
spend
with
my
mother
and
my
sister
.
<EOS>
so
I
turn
my
step
northward
in
the
direction
of
Hampstead
.
  
<EOS>
event
which
I
have
yet
to
relate
make
it
necessary
to
mention
in
this
place
that
my
father
have
be
dead
some
year
at
the
period
of
which
I
be
now
write
;
and
that
my
sister
Sarah
and
I
be
the
sole
survivor
of
a
family
of
five
child
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
a
drawing
-
master
before
me
.
<EOS>
His
exertion
have
make
him
highly
successful
in
his
profession
;
and
his
affectionate
anxiety
to
provide
for
the
future
of
those
who
be
dependent
on
his
labour
have
impel
him
,
from
the
time
of
his
marriage
,
to
devote
to
the
insuring
of
his
life
a
much
large
portion
of
his
income
than
most
man
consider
it
necessary
to
set
aside
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
thank
to
his
admirable
prudence
and
self
-
denial
<EOS>
my
mother
and
sister
be
leave
,
after
his
death
,
as
independent
of
the
world
as
they
have
be
during
his
lifetime
.
<EOS>
I
succeed
to
his
connection
,
and
have
every
reason
to
feel
grateful
for
the
prospect
that
await
me
at
my
starting
in
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
quiet
twilight
be
still
tremble
on
the
topmost
ridge
of
the
heath
;
and
the
view
of
London
below
me
have
sink
into
a
black
gulf
in
the
shadow
of
the
cloudy
night
,
when
I
stand
before
the
gate
of
my
mother
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
ring
the
bell
before
the
house
door
be
open
violently
;
my
worthy
italian
friend
,
Professor
Pesca
,
appear
in
the
servant
's
place
;
and
dart
out
joyously
to
receive
me
,
with
a
shrill
foreign
parody
on
an
english
cheer
.
  
<EOS>
on
his
own
account
,
and
,
I
must
be
allow
to
add
,
on
mine
also
,
the
Professor
merit
the
honour
of
a
formal
introduction
.
<EOS>
accident
have
make
him
the
starting
-
point
of
the
strange
family
story
which
it
be
the
purpose
of
these
page
to
unfold
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
first
become
acquainted
with
my
italian
friend
by
meet
him
at
certain
great
house
where
he
teach
his
own
language
<EOS>
and
I
teach
draw
.
<EOS>
all
I
then
know
of
the
history
of
his
life
be
,
that
he
have
once
hold
a
situation
in
the
University
of
Padua
;
that
he
have
leave
Italy
for
political
reason
(
the
nature
of
which
he
uniformly
decline
to
mention
to
any
one
)
;
and
that
he
have
be
for
many
year
respectably
establish
in
London
as
a
teacher
of
language
.
  
<EOS>
without
be
actually
a
dwarf
 
for
he
be
perfectly
well
proportion
from
head
to
foot
 
<EOS>
Pesca
be
,
I
think
,
the
small
human
being
I
ever
see
out
of
a
show
-
room
.
<EOS>
remarkable
anywhere
,
by
his
personal
appearance
,
he
be
still
further
distinguish
among
the
rank
and
file
of
mankind
by
the
harmless
eccentricity
of
his
character
.
<EOS>
the
rule
idea
of
his
life
appear
to
be
,
that
he
be
bind
to
show
his
gratitude
to
the
country
which
have
afford
him
an
asylum
and
a
means
of
subsistence
by
do
his
utmost
to
turn
himself
into
an
Englishman
.
<EOS>
not
content
with
pay
the
nation
in
general
the
compliment
of
invariably
carry
an
umbrella
,
and
invariably
wear
gaiter
and
a
white
hat
,
the
Professor
further
aspire
to
become
an
Englishman
in
his
habit
and
amusement
,
as
well
as
in
his
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
find
us
distinguish
,
as
a
nation
,
by
our
love
of
athletic
exercise
,
the
little
man
,
in
the
innocence
of
his
heart
,
devote
himself
impromptu
to
all
our
english
sport
and
pastime
whenever
he
have
the
opportunity
of
join
them
;
firmly
persuade
that
he
could
adopt
our
national
amusement
of
the
field
by
an
effort
of
will
precisely
as
he
have
adopt
our
national
gaiter
and
our
national
white
hat
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
see
him
risk
his
limb
blindly
at
a
fox
-
hunt
and
in
a
cricket
-
field
;
and
soon
afterwards
I
see
him
risk
his
life
,
just
as
blindly
,
in
the
sea
at
Brighton
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
meet
there
accidentally
,
and
be
bathe
together
.
<EOS>
if
we
have
be
engage
in
any
exercise
peculiar
to
my
own
nation
I
should
,
of
course
,
have
look
after
Pesca
carefully
;
but
as
foreigner
be
generally
quite
as
well
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
in
the
water
as
Englishmen
,
it
never
occur
to
me
that
the
art
of
swimming
may
merely
add
one
more
to
the
list
of
manly
exercise
which
the
Professor
believe
that
he
could
learn
impromptu
.
<EOS>
soon
after
we
have
both
strike
out
from
shore
,
I
stop
,
find
my
friend
do
not
gain
on
me
,
and
turn
round
to
look
for
him
.
<EOS>
to
my
horror
and
amazement
,
I
see
nothing
between
me
and
the
beach
but
two
little
white
arm
which
struggle
for
an
instant
above
the
surface
of
the
water
,
and
then
disappear
from
view
.
<EOS>
when
I
dive
for
him
,
the
poor
little
man
be
lie
quietly
coil
up
at
the
bottom
,
in
a
hollow
of
shingle
,
look
by
many
degree
small
than
I
have
ever
see
him
look
before
.
<EOS>
during
the
few
minute
that
elapse
while
I
be
take
him
in
,
the
air
revive
him
,
and
he
ascend
the
step
of
the
machine
with
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
with
the
partial
recovery
of
his
animation
come
the
return
of
his
wonderful
delusion
on
the
subject
of
swimming
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
his
chatter
tooth
would
let
him
speak
,
he
smile
vacantly
,
and
say
he
think
it
must
have
be
the
Cramp
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
thoroughly
recover
himself
,
and
have
join
me
on
the
beach
,
his
warm
southern
nature
break
through
all
artificial
english
restraint
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
He
overwhelm
me
with
the
wildest
expression
of
affection
 
exclaim
passionately
,
in
his
exaggerated
italian
way
,
that
he
would
hold
his
life
henceforth
at
my
disposal
 
and
declare
that
he
should
never
be
happy
again
until
he
have
find
an
opportunity
of
prove
his
gratitude
by
render
me
some
service
which
I
may
remember
,
on
my
side
,
to
the
end
of
my
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
my
good
to
stop
the
torrent
of
his
tear
and
protestation
by
persist
in
treat
the
whole
adventure
as
a
good
subject
for
a
joke
;
and
succeed
at
last
,
as
I
imagine
,
in
lessen
Pesca
's
overwhelming
sense
of
obligation
to
me
.
<EOS>
little
<EOS>
do
I
think
then
 
little
<EOS>
do
I
think
afterwards
when
our
pleasant
holiday
have
draw
to
an
end
 
that
the
opportunity
of
serve
me
for
which
my
grateful
companion
so
ardently
long
be
soon
to
come
;
that
he
be
eagerly
to
seize
it
on
the
instant
;
and
that
by
so
do
he
be
to
turn
the
whole
current
of
my
existence
into
a
new
channel
,
and
to
alter
me
to
myself
almost
past
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
yet
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
not
dive
for
Professor
Pesca
when
he
lie
under
water
on
his
shingle
bed
,
I
should
in
all
human
probability
never
have
be
connect
with
the
story
which
these
page
will
relate
 
<EOS>
I
should
never
,
perhaps
,
have
hear
even
the
name
of
the
woman
who
have
live
in
all
my
thought
,
who
have
possess
herself
of
all
my
energy
,
who
have
become
the
one
guide
influence
that
now
direct
the
purpose
of
my
life
.
    
<EOS>
Pesca
's
face
and
manner
,
on
the
evening
when
we
confront
each
other
at
my
mother
's
gate
,
be
more
than
sufficient
to
inform
me
that
something
extraordinary
have
happen
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
useless
,
however
,
to
ask
him
for
an
immediate
explanation
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
conjecture
,
while
he
be
drag
me
in
by
both
hand
,
that
(
know
my
habit
)
he
have
come
to
the
cottage
to
make
sure
of
meet
me
that
night
,
and
that
he
have
some
news
to
tell
of
an
unusually
agreeable
kind
.
  
<EOS>
We
both
bounce
into
the
parlour
in
a
highly
abrupt
and
undignified
manner
.
<EOS>
My
mother
sit
by
the
open
window
laugh
and
fan
herself
.
<EOS>
Pesca
be
one
of
her
especial
favourite
and
his
wildest
eccentricity
be
always
pardonable
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
poor
dear
soul
!
<EOS>
from
the
first
moment
when
she
find
out
that
the
little
Professor
be
deeply
and
gratefully
attach
to
her
son
,
she
open
her
heart
to
him
unreservedly
,
and
take
all
his
puzzle
foreign
peculiarity
for
grant
,
without
so
much
as
attempt
to
understand
any
one
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
Sarah
,
with
all
the
advantage
of
youth
,
be
,
strangely
enough
,
less
pliable
.
<EOS>
She
do
full
justice
to
Pesca
's
excellent
quality
of
heart
;
but
she
could
not
accept
him
implicitly
,
as
my
mother
accept
him
,
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
Her
insular
notion
of
propriety
rise
in
perpetual
revolt
against
Pesca
's
constitutional
contempt
for
appearance
;
and
she
be
always
more
or
less
undisguisedly
astonished
at
her
mother
's
familiarity
with
the
eccentric
little
foreigner
.
<EOS>
I
have
observe
,
not
only
in
my
sister
's
case
,
but
in
the
instance
of
other
,
that
we
of
the
young
generation
be
nothing
like
so
hearty
and
so
impulsive
as
some
of
our
elder
.
<EOS>
I
constantly
see
old
people
flush
and
excite
by
the
prospect
of
some
anticipate
pleasure
which
altogether
fail
to
ruffle
the
tranquillity
of
their
serene
grandchild
.
<EOS>
be
we
,
I
wonder
,
quite
such
genuine
boy
and
girl
now
as
our
senior
be
in
their
time
?
<EOS>
have
the
great
advance
in
education
take
rather
too
long
a
stride
;
and
be
we
in
these
modern
day
,
just
the
least
trifle
in
the
world
too
well
bring
up
?
  
<EOS>
without
attempt
to
answer
those
question
decisively
,
I
may
at
least
record
that
I
never
see
my
mother
and
my
sister
together
in
Pesca
's
society
,
without
find
my
mother
much
the
young
woman
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
for
example
,
while
the
old
lady
be
laugh
heartily
over
the
boyish
manner
in
which
we
tumble
into
the
parlour
,
Sarah
be
perturbedly
pick
up
the
broken
piece
of
a
teacup
,
which
the
Professor
have
knock
off
the
table
in
his
precipitate
advance
to
meet
me
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
would
have
happen
,
Walter
,
"
say
my
mother
,
"
if
you
have
delay
much
long
.
<EOS>
Pesca
have
be
half
mad
with
impatience
,
and
I
have
be
half
mad
with
curiosity
.
<EOS>
the
Professor
have
bring
some
wonderful
news
with
him
,
in
which
he
say
you
be
concerned
;
and
he
have
cruelly
refuse
to
give
us
the
small
hint
of
it
till
his
friend
Walter
appear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
provoking
:
it
spoil
the
Set
,
"
murmur
Sarah
to
herself
,
mournfully
absorb
over
the
ruin
of
the
broken
cup
.
  
<EOS>
while
these
word
be
be
speak
,
Pesca
,
happily
and
fussily
unconscious
of
the
irreparable
wrong

loose
the

emotion

<EOS>
It
may
be
necessary
to
explain
here
that
Pesca
pride
himself
on
be
a
perfect
Englishman
in
his
language
,
as
well
as
in
his
dress
,
manner
,
and
amusement
.
<EOS>
have
pick
up
a
few
of
our
most
familiar
colloquial
expression
,
he
scatter
them
about
over
his
conversation
whenever
they
happen
to
occur
to
him
,
turn
them
,
in
his
high
relish
for
their
sound
and
his
general
ignorance
of
their
sense
,
into
compound
word
and
repetition
of
his
own
,
and
always
run
them
into
each
other
,
as
if
they
consist
of
one
long
syllable

<EOS>
"

fourthly

that
no

for
this
situation
unless
he
could
furnish
the
most
unexceptionable
reference
to
character
and
ability

<EOS>
the
reference
be
to
be
send
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
friend
in
London
,
who
be
empower
to
conclude
all
necessary
arrangement

<EOS>
these
instruction
be
follow
by
the
name
and
address
of
Pesca
's
employer
in
Portland
Place
 
and
there
the
note

or
memorandum
,
end
.
  
<EOS>
the
prospect
which
this
offer
of
an
engagement
hold
out
be
certainly
an
attractive
one
.
<EOS>
the
employment
be
likely
to
be
both
easy
and
agreeable
;
it
be
propose
to
me
at
the
autumn
time
of
the
year
when
I
be
least
occupy
;
and
the
term
,
judge
by
my
personal
experience
in
my
profession
,
be
surprisingly
liberal
.
<EOS>
I
know
this
;
I
know
that
I
ought
to
consider
myself
very
fortunate
if
I
succeed
in
secure
the
offer
employment
 
and
yet
,
no
sooner
have
I
read
the
memorandum
than
I
feel
an
inexplicable
unwillingness
within
me
to
stir
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
in
the
whole
of
my
previous
experience
find
my
duty
and
my
inclination
so
painfully
and
so
unaccountably
at
variance
as
I
find
them
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh

Walter

your
father
never
have
such
a
chance
as
this

say
my
mother
,
when
she
have
read
the

of

have
hand

<EOS>
"
yes

yes
;
the
term
,
in
every
sense

be
tempt

"
I
reply
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
but
before
I
send
in
my
testimonial
,
I
should
like
a
little
time
to
consider

exclaim
my

with
a
sense
of
the
overpower
richness
of
the
man
who
walk
in

<EOS>
four

and
,
more

the
charming

young

<EOS>
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
have
not
eye
enough
in
my
head
to
look
,
and
wonder
at
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
neither
my
mother
's
evident
astonishment
at
my
behaviour
,
nor
Pesca
's
fervid
enumeration
of
the
advantage
offer
to
me
by
the
new
employment
,
have
any
effect
in
shake
my
unreasonable
disinclination
to
go
to
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
after
start
all
the
petty
objection
that
I
could
think
of
to
go
to
Cumberland
,
and
after
hear
them
answer
,
one
after
another
,
to
my
own
complete
discomfiture
,
I
try
to
set
up
a
last
obstacle
by
ask
what
be
to
become
of
my
pupil
in
London
while
I
be
teach
Mr.
Fairlie
's
young
lady
to
sketch
from
nature
.
<EOS>
the
obvious
answer
to
this
be
,
that
the
great
part
of
them
would
be
away
on
their
autumn
travel
,
and
that
the
few
who
remain
at
home
may
be
confide
to
the
care
of
one
of
my
brother
drawing
-
master
,
whose
pupil
I
have
once
take
off
his
hand
under
similar
circumstance
.
<EOS>
My
sister
remind
me
that
this
gentleman
have
expressly
place
his
service
at
my
disposal
,
during
the
present
season
,
in
case
I
wish
to
leave
town
;
my
mother
seriously
appeal
to
me
not
to
let
an
idle
caprice
stand
in
the
way
of
my
own
interest
and
my
own
health
;
and
Pesca
piteously
entreat
that
I
would
not
wound
him
to
the
heart
by
reject
the
first
grateful
offer
of
service
that
he
have
be
able
to
make
to
the
friend
who
have
save
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
evident
sincerity
and
affection
which
inspire
these
remonstrance
would
have
influence
any
man
with
an
atom
of
good
feeling
in
his
composition
.
<EOS>
though
I
could
not
conquer
my
own
unaccountable
perversity
,
I
have
at
least
virtue
enough
to
be
heartily
ashamed
of
it
,
and
to
end
the
discussion
pleasantly
by
give
way
,
and
promise
to
do
all
that
be
want
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
evening
pass
merrily
enough
in
humorous
anticipation
of
my
come
life
with
the
two
young
lady
in
Cumberland

<EOS>
Pesca

inspire
by
our
national
grog

which
appear
to
get
into
his
head

in
the
most
marvellous
manner

minute
after
it
have
go
down
his
throat
,
assert
his
claim
to
be
consider
a
complete
Englishman

a
series
of
speech
in
rapid
succession

health

health

two
young
Misses

immediately
afterwards

for
the

party

"
a

my
little
friend
confidentially
,
as
we
walk
home
together

I
be
flush
by
the
recollection
of
my
own
eloquence

<EOS>
My
soul
burst
itself
with
ambition

<EOS>
one
of
these
day
I
go
into
your
noble
Parliament

It

the
dream
of
my
whole
life
to

Honourable
Pesca

"
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
I
send
my
testimonial
to
the
Professor
's
employer
in
Portland
Place
.
<EOS>
three
day
pass
,
and
I
conclude
,
with
secret
satisfaction
,
that
my
paper
have
not
be
find
sufficiently
explicit
.
<EOS>
on
the
fourth
day
,
however
,
an
answer
come
.
<EOS>
It
announce
that
Mr.
Fairlie
accept
my
service
,
and
request
me
to
start
for
Cumberland
immediately
.
<EOS>
all
the
necessary
instruction
for
my
journey
be
carefully
and
clearly
add
in
a
postscript
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
my
arrangement
,
unwillingly
enough
,
for
leave
London
early
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
towards
evening
Pesca
look
in
,
on
his
way
to
a
dinner
-
party
,
to
bid
me
good
-
bye
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
dry
my
tear
in
your
absence
,
"
say
the
Professor
gaily
,
"
with
this
glorious
thought
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
auspicious
hand
that
have
give
the
first
push
to
your
fortune
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
go
,
my
friend
!
<EOS>
when
your
sun
shine
in
Cumberland
(
english
proverb
)
,
in
the
name
of
heaven
make
your
hay
.
<EOS>
marry
one
of
the
two
young
Misses
;
become
Honourable
Hartright
,
M.P.
;
and
when
you
be
on
the
top
of
the
ladder
remember
that
Pesca
,
at
the
bottom
,
have
do
it
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
try
to
laugh
with
my
little
friend
over
his
parting
jest
,
but
my
spirit
be
not
to
be
command
.
<EOS>
something
jar
in
me
almost
painfully
while
he
be
speak
his
light
farewell
word
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
leave
alone
again
nothing
remain
to
be
do
but
to
walk
to
the
Hampstead
cottage
and
bid
my
mother
and
Sarah
good
-
bye
.
    
<EOS>
the
heat
have
be
painfully
oppressive
all
day
,
and
it
be
now
a
close
and
sultry
night
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
and
sister
have
speak
so
many
last
word
,
and
have
beg
me
to
wait
another
five
minute
so
many
time
,
that
it
be
nearly
midnight
when
the
servant
lock
the
garden
-
gate
behind
me
.
<EOS>
I
walk
forward
a
few
pace
on
the
short
way
back
to
London
,
then
stop
and
hesitate
.
  
<EOS>
the
moon
be
full
and
broad
in
the
dark
blue
starless
sky
,
and
the
broken
ground
of
the
heath
look
wild
enough
in
the
mysterious
light
to
be
hundred
of
mile
away
from
the
great
city
that
lie
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
descend
any
sooner
than
I
could
help
into
the
heat
and
gloom
of
London
repel
me
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
go
to
bed
in
my
airless
chamber
,
and
the
prospect
of
gradual
suffocation
,
seem
,
in
my
present
restless
frame
of
mind
and
body
,
to
be
one
and
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
I
determine
to
stroll
home
in
the
purer
air
by
the
most
roundabout
way
I
could
take
;
to
follow
the
white
wind
path
across
the
lonely
heath
;
and
to
approach
London
through
its
most
open
suburb
by
strike
into
the
Finchley
Road
,
and
so
get
back
,
in
the
cool
of
the
new
morning
,
by
the
western
side
of
the
Regent
's
Park
.
  
<EOS>
I
wound
my
way
down
slowly
over
the
heath
,
enjoy
the
divine
stillness
of
the
scene
,
and
admire
the
soft
alternation
of
light
and
shade
as
they
follow
each
other
over
the
broken
ground
on
every
side
of
me
.
<EOS>
so
long
as
I
be
proceed
through
this
first
and
prettiest
part
of
my
night
walk
my
mind
remain
passively
open
to
the
impression
produce
by
the
view
;
and
I
think
but
little
on
any
subject
 
indeed
,
so
far
as
my
own
sensation
be
concern
,
I
can
hardly
say
that
I
think
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
I
have
leave
the
heath
and
have
turn
into
the
by
-
road
,
where
there
be
less
to
see
,
the
idea
naturally
engender
by
the
approach
change
in
my
habit
and
occupation
gradually
draw
more
and
more
of
my
attention
exclusively
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
I
have
arrive
at
the
end
of
the
road
I
have
become
completely
absorb
in
my
own
fanciful
vision
of
Limmeridge
House
,
of
Mr.
Fairlie
,
and
of
the
two
lady
whose
practice
in
the
art
of
water
-
colour
painting
I
be
so
soon
to
superintend
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
arrive
at
that
particular
point
of
my
walk
where
four
road
meet
 
the
road
to
Hampstead
,
along
which
I
have
return
,
the
road
to
Finchley
,
the
road
to
West
End
,
and
the
road
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
I
have
mechanically
turn
in
this
latter
direction
,
and
be
stroll
along
the
lonely
high
-
road
 
idly
wonder
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
what
the
Cumberland
young
lady
would
look
like
 
when
,
in
one
moment
,
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
body
be
bring
to
a
stop
by
the
touch
of
a
hand
lay
lightly
and
suddenly
on
my
shoulder
from
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
turn
on
the
instant
,
with
my
finger
tighten
round
the
handle
of
my
stick
.
  
<EOS>
there
,
in
the
middle
of
the
broad
bright
high
-
road
 
there
,
as
if
it
have
that
moment
spring
out
of
the
earth
or
drop
from
the
heaven
 
stand
the
figure
of
a
solitary
Woman
,
dress
from
head
to
foot
in
white
garment
,
her
face
bent
in
grave
inquiry
on
mine
,
her
hand
point
to
the
dark
cloud
over
London
,
as
I
face
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
far
too
seriously
startle
by
the
suddenness
with
which
this
extraordinary
apparition
stand
before
me
,
in
the
dead
of
night
and
in
that
lonely
place
,
to
ask
what
she
want
.
<EOS>
the
strange
woman
speak
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
the
road
to
London
?
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
attentively
at
her
,
as
she
put
that
singular
question
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
nearly
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
all
I
could
discern
distinctly
by
the
moonlight
be
a
colourless
,
youthful
face
,
meagre
and
sharp
to
look
at
about
the
cheek
and
chin
;
large
,
grave
,
wistfully
attentive
eye
;
nervous
,
uncertain
lip
;
and
light
hair
of
a
pale
,
brownish
-
yellow
hue
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
wild
,
nothing
immodest
in
her
manner
:
it
be
quiet
and
self
-
control
,
a
little
melancholy
and
a
little
touch
by
suspicion
;
not
exactly
the
manner
of
a
lady
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
not
the
manner
of
a
woman
in
the
humble
rank
of
life
.
<EOS>
the
voice
,
little
as
I
have
yet
hear
of
it
,
have
something
curiously
still
and
mechanical
in
its
tone
,
and
the
utterance
be
remarkably
rapid
.
<EOS>
She
hold
a
small
bag
in
her
hand
:
and
her
dress
 
bonnet
,
shawl
,
and
gown
all
of
white
 
be
,
so
far
as
I
could
guess
,
certainly
not
compose
of
very
delicate
or
very
expensive
material
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
be
slight
,
and
rather
above
the
average
height
 
her
gait
and
action
free
from
the
slight
approach
to
extravagance
.
<EOS>
this
be
all
that
I
could
observe
of
her
in
the
dim
light
and
under
the
perplexingly
strange
circumstance
of
our
meeting
.
<EOS>
what
sort
of
a
woman
she
be
,
and
how
she
come
to
be
out
alone
in
the
high
-
road
,
an
hour
after
midnight
,
I
altogether
fail
to
guess
.
<EOS>
the
one
thing
of
which
I
feel
certain
be
,
that
the
gross
of
mankind
could
not
have
misconstrue
her
motive
in
speak
,
even
at
that
suspiciously
late
hour
and
in
that
suspiciously
lonely
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
me
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
still
quietly
and
rapidly
,
and
without
the
least
fretfulness
or
impatience
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
if
that
be
the
way
to
London
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
reply
,
"
that
be
the
way
:
it
lead
to
St.
John
's
Wood
and
the
Regent
's
Park
.
<EOS>
You
must
excuse
my
not
answer
you
before
.
<EOS>
I
be
rather
startle
by
your
sudden
appearance
in
the
road
;
and
I
be
,
even
now
,
quite
unable
to
account
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
suspect
me
of
do
anything
wrong
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
I
have
do
nothing
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
have
meet
with
an
accident
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
unfortunate
in
be
here
alone
so
late
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
suspect
me
of
do
wrong
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
speak
with
unnecessary
earnestness
and
agitation
,
and
shrink
back
from
me
several
pace
.
<EOS>
I
do
my
good
to
reassure
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
suppose
that
I
have
any
idea
of
suspect
you
,
"
I
say
,
"
or
any
other
wish
than
to
be
of
assistance
to
you
,
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
I
only
wonder
at
your
appearance
in
the
road
,
because
it
seem
to
me
to
be
empty
the
instant
before
I
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
turn
,
and
point
back
to
a
place
at
the
junction
of
the
road
to
London
and
the
road
to
Hampstead
,
where
there
be
a
gap
in
the
hedge
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
come
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
hide
there
to
see
what
sort
of
man
you
be
,
before
I
risk
speak
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
and
fear
about
it
till
you
pass
;
and
then
I
be
oblige
to
steal
after
you
,
and
touch
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
steal
after
me
and
touch
me
?
<EOS>
why
not
call
to
me
?
<EOS>
strange
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
trust
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
think
the
bad
of
me
because
I
have
meet
with
an
accident
?
"
<EOS>
She
stop
in
confusion
;
shift
her
bag
from
one
hand
to
the
other
;
and
sigh
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
the
loneliness
and
helplessness
of
the
woman
touch
me
.
<EOS>
the
natural
impulse
to
assist
her
and
to
spare
her
get
the
well
of
the
judgment
,
the
caution
,
the
worldly
tact
,
which
an
old
,
wise
,
and
colder
man
may
have
summon
to
help
him
in
this
strange
emergency
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
trust
me
for
any
harmless
purpose
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
if
it
trouble
you
to
explain
your
strange
situation
to
me
,
do
not
think
of
return
to
the
subject
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
ask
you
for
any
explanation
.
<EOS>
tell
me
how
I
can
help
you
;
and
if
I
can
,
I
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
kind
,
and
I
be
very
,
very
thankful
to
have
meet
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
first
touch
of
womanly
tenderness
that
I
have
hear
from
her
tremble
in
her
voice
as
she
say
the
word
;
but
no
tear
glisten
in
those
large
,
wistfully
attentive
eye
of
her
,
which
be
still
fix
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
be
in
London
once
before
,
"
she
go
on
,
more
and
more
rapidly
,
"
and
I
know
nothing
about
that
side
of
it
,
yonder
.
<EOS>
Can
I
get
a
fly
,
or
a
carriage
of
any
kind

be
it
too
late
?
<EOS>
I
do
not

<EOS>
if
you
could
show
me
where
to
get
a
fly
 
and
if
you
will
only
promise
not

interfere
with
me
,
and
to
let
me
leave
you
,
when

how
I
please
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
friend
in
London
who
will
be
glad
to
receive
me
 
<EOS>
I
want
nothing
else
 
<EOS>
will
you
promise
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
anxiously
up
and
down
the
road
;
shift
her
bag
again
from
one
hand
to
the
other
;
repeat
the
word
,
"
Will
you
promise
?
"
and
look
hard
in
my
face
,
with
a
plead
fear
and
confusion
that
it
trouble
me
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
here
be
a
stranger
utterly
and
helplessly
at
my
mercy
 
and
that
stranger
a
forlorn
woman
.
<EOS>
no
house
be
near
;
no
one
be
pass
whom
I
could
consult
;
and
no
earthly
right
exist
on
my
part
to
give
me
a
power
of
control
over
her
,
even
if
I
have
know
how
to
exercise
it
.
<EOS>
I
trace
these
line
,
self
-
distrustfully
,
with
the
shadow
of
after
-
event
darken
the
very
paper
I
write
on
;
and
still
I
say
,
what
could
I
do
?
  
<EOS>
what
I
do
do
,
be
to
try
and
gain
time
by
question
her
.

you
sure

a

"
  
<EOS>
as
she
repeat
the
word
for
the
third
time
,
she
come
close
to
me
and
lay
her
hand
,
with
a
sudden
gentle
stealthiness
,
on
my
bosom
 
<EOS>
a
thin
hand
;
a
cold
hand
(
when
I
remove
it
with
mine
)
even
on
that
sultry
night
.
<EOS>
remember
that
I
be
young

remember
that
the
hand
which
touch
me
be
a
woman
's

<EOS>
"
Will
you
promise
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes

"
  
<EOS>
one
word
!
<EOS>
the
little
familiar
word
that
be
on
everybody
's
lip
,
every
hour
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
oh
me
!
<EOS>
and
I
tremble
,
now
,
when
I
write
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
set
our
face
towards
London
,
and
walk
on
together
in
the
first
still
hour
of
the
new
day
 
I
,
and
this
woman
,
whose
name
,
whose
character
,
whose
story
,
whose
object
in
life
,
whose
very
presence
by
my
side
,
at
that
moment
,
be
fathomless
mystery
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
a
dream
.
<EOS>
be
I
Walter
Hartright
?
<EOS>
be
this
the
well
-
know
,
uneventful
road
,
where
holiday
people
stroll
on
Sundays
?
<EOS>
have
I
really
leave
,
little
more
than
an
hour
since
,
the
quiet
,
decent
,
conventionally
domestic
atmosphere
of
my
mother
's
cottage
?
<EOS>
I
be
too
bewilder
 
<EOS>
too
conscious
also
of
a
vague
sense
of
something
like
self
-
reproach
 
to
speak
to
my
strange
companion
for
some
minute
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
voice
again
that
first
break
the
silence
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
ask
you
something
,
"
she
say
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
many
people
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
a
great
many
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
many
man
of
rank
and
title
?
<EOS>
"
there
be
an
unmistakable
tone
of
suspicion
in
the
strange
question
.
<EOS>
I
hesitate
about
answer
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
some
,
"
I
say
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
many
"
 
<EOS>
she
come
to
a
full
stop
,
and
look
me
searchingly
in
the
face
 
"
many
man
of
the
rank
of
Baronet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
too
much
astonish
to
reply
,
I
question
her
in
my
turn
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
ask
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
hope
,
for
my
own
sake
,
there
be
one
Baronet
that
you
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
me
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
 
I
dare
not
 
<EOS>
I
forget
myself
when
I
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
speak
loudly
and
almost
fiercely
,
raise
her
clenched
hand
in
the
air
,
and
shake
it
passionately
;
then
,
on
a
sudden
,
control
herself
again
,
and
add
,
in
tone
lower
to
a
whisper
"
<EOS>
tell
me
which
of
them
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
could
hardly
refuse
to
humour
her
in
such
a
trifle
,
and
I
mention
three
name
.
<EOS>
two
,
the
name
of
father
of
family
whose
daughter
I
teach
;
one
,
the
name
of
a
bachelor
who
have
once
take
me
a
cruise
in
his
yacht
,
to
make
sketch
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
you
don't
know
him
,
"
she
say
,
with
a
sigh
of
relief
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
a
man
of
rank
and
title
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
far
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
a
drawing
-
master
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
the
reply
pass
my
lip
 
a
little
bitterly
,
perhaps
 
she
take
my
arm
with
the
abruptness
which
characterise
all
her
action
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
a
man
of
rank
and
title
,
"
she
repeat
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
thank
God
!
<EOS>
I
may
trust
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
hitherto
contrive
to
master
my
curiosity
out
of
consideration
for
my
companion
;
but
it
get
the
well
of
me
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
you
have
serious
reason
to
complain
of
some
man
of
rank
and
title
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
the
baronet
,
whose
name
you
be
unwilling
to
mention
to
me
,
have
do
you
some
grievous
wrong
?
<EOS>
be
he
the
cause
of
<EOS>
your
be
out
here
at
this
strange
time
of
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
ask
me
:
do
not
make
me
talk
of
it
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
fit
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
cruelly
use
and
cruelly
wrong
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
kind
than
ever
,
if
you
will
walk
on
fast
,
and
not
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
sadly
want
to
quiet
myself
,
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
move
forward
again
at
a
quick
pace
;
and
for
half
an
hour
,
at
least
,
not
a
word
pass
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
from
time
to
time
,
be
forbid
to
make
any
more
inquiry
,
I
steal
a
look
at
her
face
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
the
same
;
the
lip
close
shut
,
the
brow
frown
,
the
eye
look
straight
forward
,
eagerly
and
yet
absently
.
<EOS>
We
have
reach
the
first
house
,
and
be
close
on
the
new
Wesleyan
college
,
before
her
set
feature
relaxed
and
she
speak
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
live
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
as
I
answer
,
it
strike
me
that
she
may
have
form
some
intention
of
appeal
to
me
for
assistance
or
advice
,
and
that
I
ought
to
spare
her
a
possible
disappointment
by
warn
her
of
my
approach
absence
from
home
.
<EOS>
so
I
add
,
"
but
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
shall
be
away
from
London
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
?
"
she
ask
.
<EOS>
"
north
or
south
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
north
 
to
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cumberland
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeat
the
word
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
wish
I
be
go
there
too
.
<EOS>
I
be
once
happy
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
try
again
to
lift
the
veil
that
hang
between
this
woman
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
be
bear
,
"
I
say
,
"
in
the
beautiful
Lake
country
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
bear
in
Hampshire
;
but
I
once
go
to
school
for
a
little
while
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
lake
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
any
lake
.
<EOS>
It
be
Limmeridge
village
,
and
Limmeridge
House
,
I
should
like
to
see
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
my
turn
now
to
stop
suddenly
.
<EOS>
in
the
excited
state
of
my
curiosity
,
at
that
moment
,
the
chance
reference
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
place
of
residence
,
on
the
lip
of
my
strange
companion
,
stagger
me
with
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
anybody
call
after
us
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
,
look
up
and
down
the
road
affrightedly
,
the
instant
I
stop
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
strike
by
the
name
of
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
I
hear
it
mention
by
some
Cumberland
people
a
few
day
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
ah
!
not
my
people
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairlie
be
dead
;
and
her
husband
be
dead
;
and
their
little
girl
may
be
marry
and
go
away
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
who
live
at
Limmeridge
now
.
<EOS>
if
any
more
be
leave
there
of
that
name
,
I
only
know
I
love
them
for
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
seem
about
to
say
more
;
but
while
she
be
speak
,
we
come
within
view
of
the
turnpike
,
at
the
top
of
the
Avenue
Road
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
tighten
round
my
arm
,
and
she
look
anxiously
at
the
gate
before
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
the
turnpike
man
look
out
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
look
out
;
no
one
else
be
near
the
place
when
we
pass
through
the
gate
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
the
gas
-
lamp
and
house
seem
to
agitate
her
,
and
to
make
her
impatient
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
London
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
any
carriage
I
can
get
?
<EOS>
I
be
tired
and
frightened
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
shut
myself
in
and
be
drive
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
explain
to
her
that
we
must
walk
a
little
further
to
get
to
a
cab
-
stand
,
unless
we
be
fortunate
enough
to
meet
with
an
empty
vehicle
;
and
then
try
to
resume
the
subject
of
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
It
be
useless
.
<EOS>
that
idea
of
shut
herself
in
,
and
be
drive
away
,
have
now
get
full
possession
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
could
think
and
talk
of
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
hardly
proceed
a
third
of
the
way
down
the
Avenue
Road
when
I
see
a
cab
draw
up
at
a
house
a
few
door
below
us
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
get
out
and
let
himself
in
at
the
garden
door
.
<EOS>
I
hail
the
cab
,
as
the
driver
mount
the
box
again
.
<EOS>
when
we
cross
the
road
,
my
companion
's
impatience
increase
to
such
an
extent
that
she
almost
force

"
She
speak
with
breathless
eagerness
,
and
press
by
me
into
the
cab
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
assure
myself
that
the
man
be
sober
as
well
as
civil
before
I
let
her
enter
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
when
she
be
seat
inside
,
I
entreat
her
to
let
me
see
her
set
down
safely
at
her
destination

<EOS>
"

vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
I

"
  
<EOS>
My
hand
be
on
the
cab
door
.
<EOS>
She
catch
it
in
her
,
kiss
it
,
and
push
it
away
.
<EOS>
the
cab
drive
off
at
the
same
moment
 
I
start
into
the
road
,
with
some
vague
idea
of
stop
it
again
,
I
hardly
know
why
 
hesitate
from
dread
of
frightening
and
distress
her
 
call
,
at
last
,
but
not
loudly
enough
to
attract
the
driver
's
attention
.
<EOS>
the
sound
of
the
wheel
grow
fainter
in
the
distance
 
the

melt
into
the
black
shadow
on
the
road
 
<EOS>
the

<EOS>
ten
minute
or
more
have
pass
.
<EOS>
I
be
still
on
the
same
side
of
the
way
;
now
mechanically
walk
forward
a
few
pace
;
now
stop
again
absently
.
<EOS>
at
one
moment
I
find
myself
doubt
the
reality
of
my
own
adventure
;
at
another
I
be
perplex
and
distress
by
an
uneasy
sense
of
have
do
wrong
,
which
yet
leave
me
confusedly
ignorant
of
how
I
could
have
do
right
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
where
I
be
go
,
or
what
I
mean
to
do
next
;
I
be
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
confusion
of
my
own
thought
,
when
I
be
abruptly
recall
to
myself
 
<EOS>
awaken
<EOS>
,
I
may
almost
say
 
by
the
sound
of
rapidly
approach
wheel
close
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
on
the
dark
side
of
the
road
,
in
the
thick
shadow
of
some
garden
tree
,
when
I
stop
to
look
round
.
<EOS>
on
the
opposite
and
light
side
of
the
way

a
short
distance
below

I
stand

the

look
at
the
card
that
be

down
to
him
.

"
She

"
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
with
truth
that
the
terrible
inference
which
those
word
suggest
flash
upon
me
like
a
new
revelation
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
strange
question
put
to
me
by
the
woman
in
white
,
after
my
ill
-
consider
promise
to
leave
her
free
to
act
as
she
please
,
have
suggest
the
conclusion
either
that
she
be
naturally
flighty
and
unsettled
,
or
that
some
recent
shock
of
terror
have
disturb
the
balance
of
her
faculty
.
<EOS>
but
the
idea
of
absolute
insanity
which
we
all
associate
with
the
very
name
of
an
Asylum
,
have
,
I
can
honestly
declare
,
never
occur
to
me
,
in
connection
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
nothing
,
in
her
language
or
her
action
,
to
justify
it
at
the
time
;
and
even
with
the
new
light
throw
on
her
by
the
word
which
the
stranger
have
address
to
the
policeman
,
I
could
see
nothing
to
justify
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
?
<EOS>
assist
the
victim
of
the
most
horrible
of
all
false
imprisonment
to
escape
;
or
cast
loose
on
the
wide
world
of
London
an
unfortunate
creature
,
whose
action
it
be
my
duty
,
and
every
man
's
duty
,
mercifully
to
control
?
<EOS>
I
turn
sick
at
heart
when
the
question
occur
to
me
,
and
when
I
feel
self
-
reproachfully
that
it
be
ask
too
late
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
disturbed
state
of
my
mind
,
it
be
useless
to
think
of
go
to
bed
,
when
I
at
last
get
back
to
my
chamber
in
Clement
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
before
many
hour
elapse
it
would
be
necessary
to
start
on
my
journey
to
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
I
sit
down
and
try
,
first
to
sketch
,
then
to
read
 
but
the
woman
in
white
get
between
me
and
my
pencil
,
between
me
and
my
book
.
<EOS>
have
the
forlorn
creature
come
to
any
harm
?
<EOS>
that
be
my
first
thought
,
though
I
shrink
selfishly
from
confront
it
.
<EOS>
other
thought
follow
,
on
which
it
be
less
harrowing
to
dwell
.
<EOS>
where
have
she
stop
the
cab
?
<EOS>
what
have
become
of
her
now
?
<EOS>
have
she
be
trace
and
capture
by
the
man
in
the
chaise
?
<EOS>
or
be
she
still
capable
of
control
her
own
action
;
and
be
we
two
follow
our
widely
part
road
towards
one
point
in
the
mysterious
future
,
at
which
we
be
to
meet
once
more
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
relief
when
the
hour
come
to
lock
my
door
,
to
bid
farewell
to
London
pursuit
,
London
pupil
,
and
London
friend
,
and
to
be
in
movement
again
towards
new
interest
and
a
new
life
.
<EOS>
even
the
bustle
and
confusion
at
the
railway
terminus
,
<EOS>
so
wearisome
and
bewilder
at
other
time
,
rouse
me
and
do
me
good
.
  
<EOS>
My
travel
instruction
direct
me
to
go
to
Carlisle
,
and
then
to
diverge
by
a
branch
railway
which
run
in
the
direction
of
the
coast
.
<EOS>
as
a
misfortune
to
begin
with
,
our
engine
break
down
between
Lancaster
and
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
the
delay
occasion
by
this
accident
cause
me
to
be
too
late
for
the
branch
train
,
by
which
I
be
to
have
go
on
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
wait
some
hour
;
and
when
a
later
train
finally
deposit
me
at
the
near
station
to
Limmeridge
House
,
it
be
past
ten
,
and
the
night
be
so
dark
that
I
could
hardly
see
my
way
to
the
pony
-
chaise
which
Mr.
Fairlie
have
order
to
be
in
wait
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
driver
be
evidently
discompose
by
the
lateness
of
my
arrival
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
that
state
of
highly
respectful
sulkiness
which
be
peculiar
to
english
servant
.
<EOS>
We
drive
away
slowly
through
the
darkness
in
perfect
silence
.
<EOS>
the
road
be
bad
,
and
the
dense
obscurity
of
the
night
increase
the
difficulty
of
get
over
the
ground
quickly
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
by
my
watch
,
nearly
an
hour
and
a
half
from
the
time
of
our
leave
the
station
before
I
hear
the
sound
of
the
sea
in
the
distance
,
and
the
crunch
of
our
wheel
on
a
smooth
gravel
drive
.
<EOS>
We
have
pass
one
gate
before
enter
the
drive
,
and
we
pass
another
before
we
draw
up
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
be
receive
by
a
solemn
man
-
servant
out
of
livery
,
be
inform
that
the
family
have
retire
for
the
night
,
and
be
then
lead
into
a
large
and
lofty
room
where
my
supper
be
await
me
,
in
a
forlorn
manner
,
at
one
extremity
of
a
lonesome
mahogany
wilderness
of
dining
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
too
tired
and
out
of
spirit
to
eat
or
drink
much
,
especially
with
the
solemn
servant
wait
on
me
as
elaborately
as
if
a
small
dinner
party
have
arrive
at
the
house
instead
of
a
solitary
man
.
<EOS>
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
I
be
ready
to
be
take
up
to
my
bedchamber
.
<EOS>
the
solemn
servant
conduct
me
into
a
prettily
furnished
room
 
say
,
"
Breakfast
at
nine
o'clock
,
sir
"
 
look
all
round
him
to
see
that
everything
be
in
its
proper
place
,
and
noiselessly
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
shall
I
see
in
my
dream
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
I
think
to
myself
,
as
I
put
out
the
candle
;
"
the
woman
in
white
?
<EOS>
or
the
unknown
inhabitant
of
this
Cumberland
mansion
?
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
strange
sensation
to
be
sleep
in
the
house
,
like
a
friend
of
the
family
,
and
yet
not
to
know
one
of
the
inmate
,
even
by
sight
!
    
<EOS>
when
I
rise
the
next
morning
and
draw
up
my
blind
,
the
sea
open
before
me
joyously
under
the
broad
August
sunlight
,
and
the
distant
coast
of
Scotland
fringe
the
horizon
with
its
line
of
melt
blue
.
  
<EOS>
the
view
be
such
a
surprise
,
and
such
a
change
to
me
,
after
my
weary
London
experience
of
brick
and
mortar
landscape
,
that
I
seem
to
burst
into
a
new
life
and
a
new
set
of
thought
the
moment
I
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
a
confused
sensation
of
have
suddenly
lose
my
familiarity
with
the
past
,
without
acquire
any
additional
clearness
of
idea
in
reference
to
the
present
or
the
future
,
take
possession
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
circumstance
that
be
but
a
few
day
old
fade
back
in
my
memory
,
as
if
they
have
happen
month
and
month
since
.
<EOS>
Pesca
's
quaint
announcement
of
the
mean
by
which
he
have
procure
me
my
present
employment
;
the
farewell
evening
I
have
pass
with
my
mother
and
sister
;
even
my
mysterious
adventure
on
the
way
home
from
Hampstead
 
have
all
become
like
event
which
may
have
occur
at
some
former
epoch
of
my
existence
.
<EOS>
although
the
woman
in
white
be
still
in
my
mind
,
the
image
of
her
seem
to
have
grow
dull
and
faint
already
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
before
nine
o'clock
,
I
descend
to
the
ground
-
floor
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
solemn
man
-
servant
of
the
night
before
meet
me
wander
among
the
passage
,
and
compassionately
show
me
the
way
to
the
breakfast
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
glance
round
me
,
as
the
man
open
the
door
,
disclose
a
well
-
furnish
breakfast
-
table
,
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
long
room
,
with
many
window
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
look
from
the
table
to
the
window
farthest
from
me
,
and
see
a
lady
stand
at
it
,
with
her
back
turn
towards
me
.
<EOS>
the
instant
my
eye
rest
on
her
,
I
be
strike
by
the
rare
beauty
of
her
form
,
and
by
the
unaffected
grace
of
her
attitude
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
be
tall
,
yet
not
too
tall
;
comely
and
well
-
develop
,
yet
not
fat
;
her
head
set
on
her
shoulder
with
an
easy
,
pliant
firmness
;
her
waist
,
perfection
in
the
eye
of
a
man
,
for
it
occupy
its
natural
place
,
it
fill
out
its
natural
circle
,
it
be
visibly
and
delightfully
undeforme
by
stay
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
hear
my
entrance
into
the
room
;
and
I
allow
myself
the
luxury
of
admire
her
for
a
few
moment
,
before
I
move
one
of
the
chair
near
me
,
as
the
least
embarrassing
mean
of
attract
her
attention
.
<EOS>
She
turn
towards
me
immediately
.
<EOS>
the
easy
elegance
of
every
movement
of
her
limb
and
body
as
soon
as
she
begin
to
advance
from
the
far
end
of
the
room
,
set
me
in
a
flutter
of
expectation
to
see
her
face
clearly
.
<EOS>
She
leave
the
window
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
to
myself
,
the
lady
be
dark
.
<EOS>
She
move
forward
a
few
step
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
to
myself
,
the
lady
be
young
.
<EOS>
She
approach
near
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
to
myself
(
with
a
sense
of
surprise
which
word
fail
me
to
express
)
,
the
lady
be
ugly
!
  
<EOS>
never
be
the
old
conventional
maxim
,
that
Nature
can
not
err
,
more
flatly
contradict
 
never
be
the
fair
promise
of
a
lovely
figure
more
strangely
and
startlingly
belie
by
the
face
and
head
that
crown
it
.
<EOS>
the
lady
's
complexion
be
almost
swarthy
,
and
the
dark
down
on
her
upper
lip
be
almost
a
moustache
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
large
,
firm
,
masculine
mouth
and
jaw
;
prominent
,
pierce
,
resolute
brown
eye
;
and
thick
,
coal
-
black
hair
,
grow
unusually
low
down
on
her
forehead
.
<EOS>
Her
expression
 
bright
,
frank
,
and
intelligent
 
appear
,
while
she
be
silent
,
to
be
altogether
want
in
those
feminine
attraction
of
gentleness
and
pliability
,
without
which
the
beauty
of
the
handsome
woman
alive
be
beauty
incomplete
.
<EOS>
to
see
such
a
face
as
this
set
on
shoulder
that
a
sculptor
would
have

the

the
lady
interrogatively
,
her
dark
face
light
up
with
a
smile

soften
and
grow
womanly
the
moment
she
begin
to
speak

"
We
resign
all
hope
of
you
last
night
,

go
to
bed
as
usual

accept
my
apology
for
our
apparent
want
of
attention
;

allow
me
to
introduce
myself
as
one
of
your
pupil

Shall
we
shake
hand

<EOS>
I
suppose
we
must
come
to
it
sooner

later

why
not
sooner

odd

of
welcome

pleasant

to
me
with
the
easy

unaffected
self

reliance

a
highly

breed
woman
.
<EOS>
We
sit
down
together
at
the
breakfast
-
table
in
as
cordial
and
customary
a
manner
as
if
we
have
know
each
other
for
year
,
and
have
meet
at
Limmeridge
House
to
talk
over
old
time
by
previous
appointment
.

I
hope
you
come
here

good

make
the
good
of
your

the
lady

<EOS>
"
You
will
have
to
begin
this
morning
by
put
up
with
no
other
company
at
breakfast
than
mine
.
<EOS>
My
sister
be
in
her
own
room
,
nursing
that
essentially
feminine
malady
,
a
slight
headache
;
and
her
old
governess
,
Mrs.
Vesey
,
be
charitably
attend
on
her
with
restorative
tea
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
Mr.
Fairlie
,
never
join
us
at
any
of
our
meal
:
he
be
an
invalid
,
and
keep
bachelor
state
in
his
own
apartment
.
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
else
in
the
house
<EOS>
but
me
.
<EOS>
two
young
lady
have
be
stay
here
,
but
they
go
away
yesterday
,
in
despair
;
and
no
wonder
.
<EOS>
all
through
their
visit
(
in
consequence
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
invalid
condition
)
we
produce
no
such
convenience
in
the
house
as
a
flirtable
,
danceable
,
small
-
talkable
creature
of
the
male
sex
;
and
the
consequence
be
,
we
do
nothing
but
quarrel
,
especially
at
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
how
can
you
expect
four
woman
to
dine
together
alone
every
day
,
and
not
quarrel
?
<EOS>
We
be
such
fool
,
we
can
not
entertain
each
other
at
table
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
do
not
think
much
of
my
own
sex
,
Mr.
Hartright
 
which
will
you
have
,
tea
or
coffee
?
 
<EOS>
no
woman
do
think
much
of
her
own
sex
,
although
few
of
them
confess
it
as
freely
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
dear
me
,
you
look
puzzle
.
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
be
you
wonder
what
you
will
have
for
breakfast
?
<EOS>
or
be
you
surprised
at
my
careless
way
of
talk
?
<EOS>
in
the
first
case
,
I
advise
you
,
as
a
friend
,
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
cold
ham
at
your
elbow
,
and
to
wait
till
the
omelette
come
in
.
<EOS>
in
the
second
case
,
I
will
give
you
some
tea
to
compose
your
spirit
,
and
do
all
a
woman
can
(
which
be
very
little
,
by
-
the
-
bye
)
to
hold
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
hand
me
my
cup
of
tea
,
laugh
gaily
.
<EOS>
Her
light
flow
of
talk
,
and
her
lively
familiarity
of
manner
with
a
total
stranger
,
be
accompany
by
an
unaffected
naturalness
and
an
easy
inborn
confidence
in
herself
and
her
position
,
which
would
have
secure
her
the
respect
of
the
most
audacious
man
breathe
.
<EOS>
while
it
be
impossible
to
be
formal
and
reserved
in
her
company
,
it
be
more
than
impossible
to
take
the
faint
vestige
of
a
liberty
with
her
,
even
in
thought
.
<EOS>
I
feel
this
instinctively
,
even
while
I
catch
the
infection
of
her
own
bright
gaiety
of
spirit
 
even
while
I
do
my
good
to
answer
her
in
her
own
frank
,
lively
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
she
say
,
when
I
have
suggest
the
only
explanation
I
could
offer
,
to
account
for
my
perplex
look
,
"
I
understand
.
<EOS>
You
be
such
a
perfect
stranger
in
the
house
,
that
you
be
puzzle
by
my
familiar
reference
to
the
worthy
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
natural
enough
:
I
ought
to
have
think
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
I
can
set
it
right
now
.
<EOS>
suppose
I
begin
with
myself
,
so
as
to
get
do
with
that
part
of
the
subject
as
soon
as
possible
?
<EOS>
My
name
be
Marian
Halcombe
;
and
I
be
as
inaccurate
as
woman
usually
be
,
in
call
Mr.
Fairlie
my
uncle
,
and
Miss
Fairlie
my
sister
.
<EOS>
My
mother
be
twice
married
:
the
first
time
to
Mr.
Halcombe
,
my
father
;
the
second
time
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
my
half
-
sister
's
father
.
<EOS>
except
that
we
be
both
orphan
,
we
be
in
every
respect
as
unlike
each
other
as
possible
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
a
poor
man
,
and
Miss
Fairlie
's
father
be
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
nothing
,
and
she
have
a
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
be
dark
and
ugly
,
and
she
be
fair
and
pretty
.
<EOS>
everybody
think
me
crabbed
and
odd
(
with
perfect
justice
)
;
and
everybody
think
her
sweet
-
tempered
and
charming
(
with
more
justice
still
)
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
she
be
an
angel
;
and
I
be
try
some
of
that
marmalade
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
and
finish
the
sentence
,
in
the
name
of
female
propriety
,
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
what
be
I
to
tell
you
about
Mr.
Fairlie
?
<EOS>
upon
my
honour
,
I
hardly
know
.
<EOS>
He
be
sure
to
send
for
you
after
breakfast
,
and
you
can
study
him
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
I
may
inform
you
,
first
,
that
he
be
the
late
Mr.
Fairlie
's
young
brother
;
secondly
,
that
he
be
a
single
man
;
and
thirdly
,
that
he
be
Miss
Fairlie
's
guardian
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
live
without
her
,
and
she
can
not
live
without
me
;
and
that
be
how
I
come
to
be
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
My
sister
and
I
be
honestly
fond
of
each
other
;
which
,
you
will
say
,
be
perfectly
unaccountable
,
under
the
circumstance
,
and
I
quite
agree
with
you
 
<EOS>
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
You
must
please
both
of
us
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
or
please
neither
of
us
:
<EOS>
and
,
what
be
still
more
trying
,
you
will
be
throw
entirely
upon
our
society
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
be
an
excellent
person
,
who
possess
all
the
cardinal
virtue
,
and
count
for
nothing
;
and
Mr.
Fairlie
be
too
great
an
invalid
to
be
a
companion
for
anybody
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
be
the
matter
with
him
,
and
the
doctor
do
not
know
what
be
the
matter
with
him
,
and
he
do
not
know
himself
what
be
the
matter
with
him
.
<EOS>
We
all
say
it
be
on
the
nerve
,
and
we
none
of
us
know
what
we
mean
when
we
say
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
advise
you
to
humour
his
little
peculiarity
,
when
you
see
him
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
admire
his
collection
of
coin
,
print
,
and
water
-
colour
drawing
,
and
you
will
win
his
heart
.
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
if
you
can
be
content
with
a
quiet
country
life
,
I
do
not
see
why
you
should
not
get
on
very
well
here
.
<EOS>
from
breakfast
to
lunch
,
Mr.
Fairlie
's
drawing
will
occupy
you
.
<EOS>
after
lunch
,
Miss
Fairlie
and
I
shoulder
our
sketch
-
book
,
and
go
out
to
misrepresent
Nature
,
under
your
direction
.
<EOS>
drawing
be
her
favourite
whim
,
mind
,
not
mine
.
<EOS>
woman
can
not
draw
 
their
mind
be
too
flighty
,
and
their
eye
be
too
inattentive
.
<EOS>
no
matter
 
my
sister
like
it
;
so
I
waste
paint
and
spoil
paper
,
for
her
sake
,
as
composedly
as
any
woman
in
England
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
evening
,
I
think
we
can
help
you
through
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
play
delightfully
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
poor
part
,
I
do
not
know
one
note
of
music
from
the
other
;
but
I
can
match
you
at
chess
,
backgammon
,
ecarte
,
and
<EOS>
(
with
the
inevitable
female
drawback
)
even
at
billiard
as
well
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
the
programme
?
<EOS>
Can
you
reconcile
yourself
to
our
quiet
,
regular
life
?
<EOS>
or
do
you
mean
to
be
restless
,
and
secretly
thirst
for
change
and
adventure
,
in
the
humdrum
atmosphere
of
Limmeridge
House
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
run
on
thus
far
,
in
her
gracefully
banter
way
,
with
no
other
interruption
on
my
part
than
the
unimportant
reply
which
politeness
require
of
me
.
<EOS>
the
turn
of
the
expression
,
however
,
in
her
last
question
,
or
rather
the
one
chance
word
,
"
adventure
,
"
lightly
as
it
fall
from
her
lip
,
recall
my
thought
to
my
meeting
with
the
woman
in
white
,
and
urge
me
to
discover
the
connection
which
the
stranger
's
own
reference
to
Mrs.
Fairlie
inform
me
must
once
have
exist
between
the
nameless
fugitive
from
the
Asylum
,
and
the
former
mistress
of
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
"
even
if
I
be
the
most
restless
of
mankind
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
should
be
in
no
danger
of
thirst
after
adventure
for
some
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
the
very
night
before
I
arrive
at
this
house
,
I
meet
with
an
adventure
;
and
the
wonder
and
excitement
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
can
assure
you
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
will
last
me
for
the
whole
term
of
my
stay
in
Cumberland
,
if
not
for
a
much
long
period
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
say
so
,
Mr.
Hartright
!
<EOS>
May
I
hear
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
claim
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
the
chief
person
in
the
adventure
be
a
total
stranger
to
me
,
and
may
perhaps
be
a
total
stranger
to
you
;
but
she
certainly
mention
the
name
of
the
late
Mrs.
Fairlie
in
term
of
the
sincerest
gratitude
and
regard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
mention
my
mother
's
name
!
<EOS>
You
interest
me
indescribably
.
<EOS>
pray
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
at
once
relate
the
circumstance
under
which
I
have
meet
the
woman
in
white
,
exactly
as
they
have
occur
;
and
I
repeat
what
she
have
say
to
me
about
Mrs.
Fairlie
and
Limmeridge
House
,
word
for
word
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
's
bright
resolute
eye
look
eagerly
into
mine
,
from
the
beginning
of
the
narrative
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Her
face
express
vivid
interest
and
astonishment
,
but
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
She
be
evidently
as
far
from
know
of
any
clue
to
the
mystery
as
I
be
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
quite
sure
of
those
word
refer
to
my
mother
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
sure
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
whoever
she
may
be
,
the
woman
be
once
at
school
in
the
village
of
Limmeridge
,
be
treat
with
especial
kindness
by
Mrs.
Fairlie
,
and
,
in
grateful
remembrance
of
that
kindness
,
feel
an
affectionate
interest
in
all
survive
member
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
Mrs.
Fairlie
and
her
husband
be
both
dead
;
and
she
speak
of
Miss
Fairlie
as
if
they
have
know
each
other
when
they
be
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
,
I
think
,
that
she
deny
belong
to
this
place
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
she
tell
me
she
come
from
Hampshire
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
entirely
fail
to
find
out
her
name
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
entirely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
strange
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
be
quite
justified
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
in
give
the
poor
creature
her
liberty
,
for
she
seem
to
have
do
nothing
in
your
presence
to
show
herself
unfit
to
enjoy
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
wish
you
have
be
a
little
more
resolute
about
find
out
her
name
.
<EOS>
We
must
really
clear
up
this
mystery
,
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
You
have
well
not
speak
of
it
yet
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
or
to
my
sister
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
of
them
,
I
be
certain
,
quite
as
ignorant
of
who
the
woman
be
,
and
of
what
her
past
history
in
connection
with
us
can
be
,
as
I
be
myself
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
also
,
in
widely
different
way
,
rather
nervous
and
sensitive
;
and
you
would
only
fidget
one
and
alarm
the
other
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
I
be
all
aflame
with
curiosity
,
and
I
devote
my
whole
energy
to
the
business
of
discovery
from
this
moment
.
<EOS>
when
my
mother
come
here
,
after
her
second
marriage
,
she
certainly
establish
the
village
school
just
as
it
exist
at
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
but
the
old
teacher
be
all
dead
,
or
go
elsewhere
;
and
no
enlightenment
be
to
be
hope
for
from
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
the
only
other
alternative
I
can
think
of
 
"
  
at
this
point
we
be
interrupt
by
the
entrance
of
the
servant
,
with
a
message
from
Mr.
Fairlie
,
intimate
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
me
,
as
soon
as
I
have
do
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
wait
in
the
hall
,
"
say
Miss
Halcombe
,
answer
the
servant
for
me
,
in
her
quick
,
ready
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
will
come
out
directly
.
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
say
,
"
she
go
on
,
address
me
again
,
"
that
my
sister
and
I
have
a
large
collection
of
my
mother
's
letter
,
address
to
my
father
and
to
hers
.
<EOS>
in
the
absence
of
any
other
mean
of
get
information
,
I
will
pass
the
morning
in
look
over
my
mother
's
correspondence
with
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
He
be
fond
of
London
,
and
be
constantly
away
from
his
country
home
;
and
she
be
accustom
,
at
such
time
,
to
write
and
report
to
him
how
thing
go
on
at
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
Her
letter
be
full
of
reference
to
the
school
in
which
she
take
so
strong
an
interest
;
and
I
think
it
more
than
likely
that
I
may
have
discover
something
when
we
meet
again
.
<EOS>
the
luncheon
hour
be
two

Mr.
Hartright

<EOS>
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
introduce
you
to
my

we
will
occupy
the

"
  
<EOS>
She
nod
to
me
with
the
lively
grace
,
the
delightful
refinement
of
familiarity
,
which
characterise
all
that
she
do
and
all
that
she
say
;
and
disappear
by
a
door
at
the
low
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
have
leave
me

I
turn
my

and
follow
the

,
on

for
the
first
time
,
to
the

of
Mr.
Fairlie

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
must
have
be
hard

<EOS>
He

all
exhausted

and
silently

the
door
for
me
to
go
out
into
the

<EOS>
We

when

can
be
accept
as
a
safe
guide
to
his

which

more

<EOS>
Mr.

's
age
,
when
I
see
him
,
may
have
be
reasonably
compute
at
over
fifty
and
under
sixty
year

<EOS>
His
beardless
face

thin

worn

and
transparently
pale
,
but
not

his
nose
be
high
and
hooked

his

be
of
a
dim
greyish

large

of
that
light

its

change
towards
grey

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
upon

he
have
a
frail

languidly

fretful

<EOS>
over

refine
look
 
something
singularly
and
unpleasantly
delicate
in
its
association
with
a

,
at
the

,
something
which
could
by
no
possibility
have
look
natural
and
appropriate
if
it

<EOS>
My
morning
's
experience
of
Miss
Halcombe
have
predispose
me
to
be
pleased
with
everybody
in
the
house
;
but
my
sympathy
shut
themselves
up
resolutely
at
the
first
sight
of
Mr.
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
on
approach
nearer
to
him

I
discover
that
he
be
not
so
entirely
without

as
I
have
at

suppose

near

some
tiny
jeweller
's
brush
,
a
wash

leather
"
stump

"
and
a
little
bottle
of
liquid
,
all
wait
to
be
use
in
various
way
for
the
removal
of
any
accidental
impurity
which
may
be
discover
on
the
coin
.
<EOS>
His
frail
white
finger
be
listlessly
toy
with
something
which
look
,
to
my
uninstructed
eye
,
like
a
dirty
pewter
medal
with
ragged
edge
,
when
I
advance
within
a
respectful
distance
of
his
chair
,
and
stop
to
make
my
bow
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
glad

Mr.

he
say
in
a
querulous

croak
voice
,
which
combine
,
in
anything
but
an
agreeable
manner
,
a
discordantly
high
tone
with
a
drowsily
languid
utterance

<EOS>
pray
sit
down
.
<EOS>
and
do
not
trouble
yourself
to
move
the
chair
,
please

in
the
wretched
state

movement
of
any

be
exquisitely
painful

me

<EOS>
have
you
see
your

<EOS>
Will

<EOS>

I

<EOS>
He
stop
me
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
,
by
close
his
eye
,
and
hold
up
one
of
his
white
hand
imploringly
.
<EOS>
I
pause
in
astonishment
;
and
the
croak
voice
honour
me
with
this
explanation
    
<EOS>
"
pray
excuse
me

<EOS>

could
you
contrive

loud

You

<EOS>
"
I
could
wish
for
nothing
pretty
and
nothing
more
comfortable

"
I
answer
,
drop
my
voice
,
and
begin
to
discover
already
that
Mr.
Fairlie
's
selfish
affectation
and
Mr.
Fairlie
's
wretched
nerve
mean
one
and
the
same
thing

barbarity

<EOS>
so
much
of
my
early
life

abroad

I

respect

<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
say
the

detestable

They

such
ass
,
be
they
not

<EOS>
do
tell
me
 
what
do
you
think
of
the
drawing
?
<EOS>
They
have
come
from
a
sale
in
a
shocking
state
 
<EOS>
I
think
they
smell
of
horrid
dealer
'
and
broker
'
finger
when
I
look
at
them
last
.
<EOS>
CAN
you
undertake
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
although
my
nerve
be
not
delicate
enough
to
detect
the
odour
of
plebeian
finger
which
have
offend
Mr.
Fairlie
's
nostril
,
my
taste
be
sufficiently
educate
to
enable
me
to
appreciate
the
value
of
the
drawing
,
while
I
turn
them
over
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
really
fine
specimen
of
english
water
-
colour
art
;
and
they
have
deserve
much
well
treatment
at
the
hand
of
their
former
possessor
than
they
appear
to
have
receive
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
drawing
,
"
I
answer
,
"
require
careful
straining
and
mount
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
they
be
well
worth

<EOS>

I
beg
your
pardon

interpose
Mr.
Fairlie

<EOS>

do
you
mind
my
close
my
eye
while
you
speak

<EOS>
even
this
light
be
too
much
for
them

<EOS>
yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
about
to
say
that
the
drawing
be
well
worth
all
the
time
and
trouble
 
<EOS>
"
  
Mr.
Fairlie
suddenly
open
his
eye
again
,
and
roll
them
with
an
expression
of
helpless
alarm
in
the
direction
of
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
entreat
you
to
excuse
me
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
he
say
in
a
feeble
flutter
.
<EOS>
"
but
surely
I
hear
some
horrid
child
in
the
garden
 
<EOS>
my
private
garden
 
<EOS>
below
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not

Mr.
Fairlie

I
hear
nothing

oblige
me

you
have

so
very
good

Mr.
Hartright

have
you
get
the

up

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
then
will
you
be
so
very
kind
as
to
look
into
the
garden
and
make
quite
sure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
comply
with
this
new
request

the

round

report
that
gratify
fact

Mr.
Fairlie

a
thousand
thank

<EOS>
My
fancy
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
child
,
thank
Heaven
,
in
the
house
;
but
the
servant
(
person
bear
without
nerve
)
will
encourage
the
child
from
the
village

<EOS>
such
brat
 
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
me
,
such
brat
!
<EOS>
Shall
I
confess
it
,
Mr.
Hartright
?
 
<EOS>
I
sadly
want
a
reform
in
the
construction
of
child
.
<EOS>
Nature
's
only
idea
seem
to
be
to
make
them
machine
for
the
production
of
incessant
noise
.
<EOS>
surely
our
delightful
Raffaello
's
conception
be
infinitely
preferable
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
point
to
the
picture
of
the
Madonna
,
the
upper
part
of
which
represent
the
conventional
cherub
of
Italian
Art

provide
with
sit
accommodation
for
their
chin

on
balloon

buff

coloured

<EOS>
"
quite
a
model
family

"
say
Mr.
Fairlie
,
leer
at
the
cherub

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
nice
round
face

and
such
nice
soft
wing

and
 
nothing
else

<EOS>
no
dirty
little
leg
to
run
about
on
,
and
no
noisy
little
lung
to
scream
with
.
<EOS>
how
immeasurably
superior
to
the
exist
construction

<EOS>
I
will
close
my
eye
again

if
you
will
allow
me

you
really
can
manage

glad

there

settle

there

I

it

Shall
we
ring
for
Louis
again

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
being
,
by
this
time
,
quite
as
anxious
,
on
my
side

as
Mr.
Fairlie
evidently
be
on
his
,
to
bring
the
interview
to
a
speedy
conclusion
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
would
try
to
render
the
summoning
of
the
servant
unnecessary
,
by
offer
the
requisite
suggestion
on
my
own
responsibility

the
only
point

Mr.

I

refer

I
think
,
to
the
instruction

I

the
two
young

just
so

Mr.

I
wish
I
feel
strong
enough
to
go
into
that
part

the
arrangement
 
<EOS>

I
do
not
.
<EOS>
the
lady
who
profit
by
your
kind
service
,
Mr.
Hartright

must
settle
,

decide

so
on

<EOS>
My

be
fond

your
charming
art

She
know
just

so
pleasant

<EOS>
when
the

green
curtain
be
closed

and
when
the
two
baize
door
be
shut
behind
me

I
stop
for
a
moment
in
the
little
circular
hall
beyond
,
and
draw
a
long
,
luxurious
breath
of
relief
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
come
to
the
surface
of
the
water
after
deep
diving
,
to
find
myself
once
more
on
the
outside
of
Mr.

room

<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
be
comfortably
establish
for
the
morning
in
my
pretty
little
studio
,
the
first
resolution
at
which
I
arrive
be
to
turn
my
step
no
more
in
the
direction
of
the
apartment
occupy
by
the
master
of
the
house
,
except
in
the
very
improbable
event
of
his
honour
me
with
a
special
invitation
to
pay
him
another
visit
.
<EOS>
have
settle
this
satisfactory
plan
of
future
conduct
in
reference
to
Mr.
Fairlie

I
soon
recover
the
serenity
of
temper
of
which
my
employer
's
haughty
familiarity
and
impudent
politeness
have
,
for
the
moment
,
deprive
me
.
<EOS>
the
remain
hour
of
the
morning
pass
away
pleasantly
enough
,
in
look
over
the
drawing
,
arrange
them
in
set
,
trim
their
ragged
edge
,
and
accomplish
the
other
necessary
preparation
in
anticipation
of
the
business
of
mount
them
.
<EOS>
I
ought
,
perhaps
,
to
have
make
more
progress
than
this
;
but
,
as
the
luncheon
-
time
draw
near
,
I
grow
restless
and
unsettle
,
and
feel
unable
to
fix
my
attention
on
work
,
even
though
that
work
be
only
of
the
humble
manual
kind
.
  
<EOS>
at
two
o'clock
I
descend
again
to
the
breakfast
-
room

little
anxiously
.
<EOS>
expectation
of
some
interest

connect
with
my
approach
reappearance
in
that
part
of
the
house

<EOS>
My
introduction
to
Miss
Fairlie

now
close
at
hand
;
and
,
if
Miss
Halcombe
's
search
through
her
mother
's

have
produce
the
result
which
she
anticipate

time
have
come
for
clear
up
the
mystery

<EOS>
when
I
enter

I
find
Miss

Mrs.
Vesey

have
be
briefly
describe
to
me
by
my
lively
companion
at

breakfast
-
table

as
possess
of

all
the
cardinal
virtue

count
for
nothing

<EOS>
"
I
can
do
little
more
than
offer
my
humble
testimony
to
the
truthfulness
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
sketch
of
the
old
lady
's
character
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
look
the
personification
of
human
composure
and
female
amiability
.

a
calm
enjoyment
of
a
calm
existence
beam
in
drowsy
smile
on

plump

placid
face

some
of
us
rush
through
life

and
some
of

saunter
through
life

<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
SAT
through
life
.
<EOS>
Sat
in
the
house
,
early
and
late
;
sit
in
the
garden
;
sit
in
unexpected
window
-
seat
in
passage
;
sit
(
on
a
camp
-
stool
)
<EOS>
when
her
friend
try
to
take
her
out
walk
;
sit
before
she
look
at
anything
,
before
she
talk
of
anything
,
before
she
answer
<EOS>
yes
,
or
no
,
to
the
common
question
 
always
with
the
same
serene
smile
on
her
lip
,
the
same
vacantly
-
attentive
turn
of
the
head
,
the
same
snugly
-
comfortable
position
of
her
hand
and
arm
,
under
every
possible
change
of
domestic
circumstance
.
<EOS>
a
mild
,
a
compliant
,
an
unutterably
tranquil
and
harmless
old
lady
,
who
never
by
any
chance
suggest
the
idea
that
she
have
be
actually
alive
since
the
hour
of
her
birth
.
<EOS>
nature
have
so
much
to
do
in
this
world
,
and
be
engage
in
generate
such
a
vast
variety
of
co
-
existent
production
,
that
she
must
surely
be
now
and
then
too
flurry
and
confuse
to
distinguish
between
the
different
process
that
she
be
carry
on
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
start
from
this
point
of
view
,
it
will
always
remain
my
private
persuasion
that
Nature
be
absorb
in
make
cabbage
when
Mrs.
Vesey
be
bear
,
and
that
the
good
lady
suffer
the
consequence
of
a
vegetable
preoccupation
in
the
mind
of
the
Mother
of
us
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Mrs.
Vesey
,
"
say
Miss
Halcombe
,
look
bright

sharp
,
and
ready
than
ever

by
contrast
with
the
undemonstrative
old
lady
at
her
side

"
what
will
you
have

<EOS>
a
cutlet
?

<EOS>
Mrs.

what
be

you
like

take
her
dimpled

off

"
<EOS>
well

it

you
have
a
little
of
both

and
suppose
you
begin
with
the
chicken

look
devour
by
anxiety

for
you

put
the

dimpled
hand
back
on
the
edge
of
the
table
;
brighten
dimly
one
moment
;
go
out
again
the
next
;
bow
obediently

say
,
"
if
you

"
  
<EOS>
surely
a
mild
,
a
compliant

an
unutterably
tranquil
and
harmless
old
lady

<EOS>
but
enough
,
perhaps
,
for
the
present
,
of
Mrs.
Vesey

<EOS>
all
this
time

there
be
no
sign
of
Miss
Fairlie

We
finish
our
luncheon
;

still
she
never
appear

Miss
Halcombe
,
whose
quick
eye
nothing
escape

notice
the
look
that
I
cast
,
from
time
to
time
,
in
the
direction
of
the
door

"
I
understand
you

have
be
downstairs

and
have
get
over
her
headache

have
not
sufficiently
recover
her
appetite

join
us
at
lunch

if
you
will
put
yourself
under

find
her
somewhere
in

<EOS>
She
take
up
a
parasol
lie
on
a
chair
near
her
,
and
lead
the
way
out
,
by
a
long
window
at
the
bottom
of
the
room
,
which
open
on
to
the
lawn

<EOS>
It
be
almost
unnecessary
to
say
that
we
leave
Mrs.
Vesey
still
seat
at
the
table
,
with
her
dimpled
hand
still
cross
on
the
edge
of
it

apparently
settle
in
that
position
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon

cross
the
lawn

Miss
Halcombe

significantly

shake
her
head

still
remain

look
over

do
not
despair

this

success

,
and
you
may
confidently
rely
on
my
spending
the
whole
evening
over
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
,
then
,
be
one
of
my
anticipation
of
the
morning
still
unfulfilled
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
wonder
,
next
,
whether
my
introduction
to
Miss
Fairlie
would
disappoint
the
expectation
that
I
have
be
form
of
her
since
breakfast
-
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
do
you
get
on
with
Mr.
Fairlie
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Miss
Halcombe
,
as
we
leave
the
lawn
and
turn
into
a
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
he
particularly
nervous
this
morning
?
<EOS>
never
mind
consider
about
your
answer
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
the
mere
fact
of
your
be
oblige
to
consider
be
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
in
your
face
that
he
be
particularly
nervous
;
and
,
as
I
be
amiably
unwilling
to
throw
you
into
the
same
condition
,
I
ask
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
turn
off
into
a
wind
path
while
she
be
speak
,
and
approach
a
pretty
summer
-
house
,
build
of
wood
,
in
the
form
of
a
miniature
swiss
chalet
.
<EOS>
the
one
room
of
the
summer
-
house
,
as
we
ascend
the
step
of
the
door
,
be
occupy
by
a
young
lady
.
<EOS>
She
be
stand
near
a
rustic
table
,
look
out
at
the
inland
view
of
moor
and
hill
present
by
a
gap
in
the
tree
,
and
absently
turn
over
the
leave
of
a
little
sketch
-
book
that
lie
at
her
side
.
<EOS>
this
be
Miss
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
how
can
I
describe
her
?
<EOS>
how
can
I
separate
her
from
my
own
sensation
,
and
from
all
that
have
happen
in
the
later
time
?
<EOS>
how
can
I
see
her
again
as
she
look
when
my
eye
first
rest
on
her
 
as
she
should
look
,
now
,
to
the
eye
that
be
about
to
see
her
in
these
page
?
  
<EOS>
the
water
-
colour
drawing
that
I
make
of
Laura
Fairlie
,
at
an
after
period
,
in
the
place
and
attitude
in
which
I
first
see
her
,
lie
on
my
desk
while
I
write
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
it
,
and
there
dawn
upon
me
brightly
,
from
the
dark
greenish
-
brown
background
of
the
summer
-
house
,
a
light
,
youthful
figure
,
clothe
in
a
simple
muslin
dress
,
the
pattern
of
it
form
by
broad
alternate
stripe
of
delicate
blue
and
white
.
<EOS>
a
scarf
of
the
same
material
sit
crisply
and
closely
round
her
shoulder
,
and
a
little
straw
hat
of
the
natural
colour
,
plainly
and
sparingly
trim
with
ribbon
to
match
the
gown
,
cover
her
head
,
and
throw
its
soft
pearly
shadow
over
the
upper
part
of
her
face
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
be
of
so
faint
and
pale
a
brown
 
not
flaxen
,
and
yet
almost
as
light
;
not
golden
,
and
yet
almost
as
glossy
 
that
it
nearly
melt
,
here
and
there
,
into
the
shadow
of
the
hat
.
<EOS>
It
be
plainly
part
and
draw
back
over
her
ear
,
and
the
line
of
it
ripple
naturally
as
it
cross
her
forehead
.
<EOS>
the
eyebrow
be
rather
dark
than
the
hair
;
and
the
eye
be
of
that
soft
,
limpid
,
turquoise
blue
,
so
often
sing
by
the
poet
,
so
seldom
see
in
real
life
.
<EOS>
lovely
eye
in
colour
,
<EOS>
lovely
eye
in
form
 
large
and
tender
and
quietly
thoughtful
 
but
beautiful
above
all
thing
in
the
clear
truthfulness
of
look
that
dwell
in
their
inmost
depth
,
and
shine
through
all
their
change
of
expression
with
the
light
of
a
purer
and
a
well
world
.
<EOS>
the
charm
 
most
gently
and
yet
most
distinctly
express
 
which
they
shed
over
the
whole
face
,
so
cover
and
transform
its
little
natural
human
blemish
elsewhere
,
that
it
be
difficult
to
estimate
the
relative
merit
and
defect
of
the
other
feature
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
to
see
that
the
low
part
of
the
face
be
too
delicately
refine
away
towards
the
chin
to
be
in
full
and
fair
proportion
with
the
upper
part
;
that
the
nose
,
in
escape
the
aquiline
bend
(
always
hard
and
cruel
in
a
woman
,
no
matter
how
abstractedly
perfect
it
may
be
)
,
have
err
a
little
in
the
other
extreme
,
and
have
miss
the
ideal
straightness
of
line
;
and
that
the
sweet
,
sensitive
lip
be
subject
to
a
slight
nervous
contraction
,
when
she
smile
,
which
draw
them
upward
a
little
at
one
corner
,
towards
the
cheek
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
possible
to
note
these
blemish
in
another
woman
's
face
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
easy
to
dwell
on
them
in
hers
,
so
subtly
be
they
connect
with
all
that
be
individual
and
characteristic
in
her
expression
,
and
so
closely
do
the
expression
depend
for
its
full
play
and
life
,
in
every
other
feature
,
on
the
move
impulse
of
the
eye
.
  
<EOS>
do
my
poor
portrait
of
her
,
my
fond
,
patient
labour
of
long
and
happy
day
,
show
me
these
thing
?
<EOS>
ah
,
how
few
of
them
be
in
the
dim
mechanical
drawing
,
and
how
many
in
the
mind
with
which
I
regard
it
!
<EOS>
a
fair
,
delicate
girl
,
in
a
pretty
light
dress
,
trifle
with
the
leave
of
a
sketch
-
book
,
while
she
look
up
from
it
with
truthful
,
innocent
blue
eye
 
that
be
all
the
drawing
can
say
;
all
,
perhaps
,
that
even
the
deep
reach
of
thought
and
pen
can
say
in
their
language
,
either
.
<EOS>
the
woman
who
first
give
life
,
light
,
and
form
to
our
shadowy
conception
of
beauty
,
fill
a
void
in
our
spiritual
nature
that
have
remain
unknown
to
us
till
she
appear
.
<EOS>
sympathy
that
lie
too
deep
for
word
,
too
deep
almost
for
thought
,
be
touch
,
at
such
time
,
by
other
charm
than
those
which
the
sense
feel
and
which
the
resource
of
expression
can
realise
.
<EOS>
the
mystery
which
underlie
the
beauty
of
woman
be
never
raise
above
the
reach
of
all
expression
until
it
have
claim
kindre
with
the
deep
mystery
in
our
own
soul
.
<EOS>
then
,
and
then
only
,
have
it
pass
beyond
the
narrow
region
on
which
light
fall
,
in
this
world
,
from
the
pencil
and
the
pen
.
  
<EOS>
think
of
her
as
you
think
of
the
first
woman
who
quicken
the
pulse
within
you
that
the
rest
of
her
sex
have
no
art
to
stir
.
<EOS>
let
the
kind
,
candid
blue
eye
meet
your
,
as
they
meet
mine
,
with
the
one
matchless
look
which
we
both
remember
so
well
.
<EOS>
let
her
voice
speak
the
music
that
you
once
love
best
,
attune
as
sweetly
to
your
ear
as
to
mine
.
<EOS>
let
her
footstep
,
as
she
come
and
go
,
in
these
page
,
be
like
that
other
footstep
to
whose
airy
fall
your
own
heart
once
beat
time
.
<EOS>
take
her
as
the
visionary
nursling
of
your
own
fancy
;
and
she
will
grow
upon
you
,
all
the
more
clearly
,
as
the
live
woman
who
dwell
in
mine
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
sensation
that
crowd
on
me
,
when
my
eye
first
look
upon
her
 
familiar
sensation
which
we
all
know
,
which
spring
to
life
in
most
of
our
heart
,
die
again
in
so
many
,
and
renew
their
bright
existence
in
so
few
 
there
be
one
that
trouble
and
perplex
me
:
one
that
seem
strangely
inconsistent
and
unaccountably
out
of
place
in
Miss
Fairlie
's
presence
.
  
<EOS>
mingle
with
the
vivid
impression
produce
by
the
charm
of
her
fair
face
and
head
,
her
sweet
expression
,
and
her
win
simplicity
of
manner
,
be
another
impression
,
which
,
in
a
shadowy
way
,
suggest
to
me
the
idea
of
something
want
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
it
seem
like
something
want
in
HER
:
at
another
,
like
something
want
in
myself
,
which
hinder
me
from
understand
her
as
I
ought
.
<EOS>
the
impression
be
always
strong
in
the
most
contradictory
manner
,
when
she
look
at
me
;
or
,
in
other
word
,
when
I
be
most
conscious
of
the
harmony
and
charm
of
her
face
,
and
yet
,
at
the
same
time
,
most
trouble
by
the
sense
of
an
incompleteness
which
it
be
impossible
to
discover
.
<EOS>
something
want
,
something
want
 
and
where
it
be
,
and
what
it
be
,
I
could
not
say
.
  
<EOS>
the
effect
of
this
curious
caprice
of
fancy
(
as
I
think
it
then
)
be
not
of
a
nature
to
set
me
at
my
ease
,
during
a
first
interview
with
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
the
few
kind
word
of
welcome
which
she
speak
find
me
hardly
self
-
possess
enough
to
thank
her
in
the
customary
phrase
of
reply
.
<EOS>
observe
my
hesitation
,
and
no
doubt
attribute
it
,
naturally
enough
,
to
some
momentary
shyness
on
my
part
,
Miss
Halcombe
take
the
business
of
talk
,
as
easily
and
readily
as
usual
,
into
her
own
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
there
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
she
say
,
point
to
the
sketch
-
book
on
the
table
,
and
to
the
little
delicate
wander
hand
that
be
still
trifle
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
surely
you
will
acknowledge
that
your
model
pupil
be
find
at
last
?
<EOS>
the
moment
she
hear
that
you
be
in
the
house
,
she
seize
her
inestimable
sketch
-
book
,
look
universal
Nature
straight
in
the
face
,
and
long
to
begin
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
laugh
with
a
ready
good
-
humour
,
which
break
out
as
brightly
as
if
it
have
be
part
of
the
sunshine
above
us
,
over
her
lovely
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
take
credit
to
myself
where
no
credit
be
due
,
"
she
say
,
her
clear
,
truthful
blue
eye
look
alternately
at
Miss
Halcombe
and
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
fond
as
I
be
of
drawing
,
I
be
so
conscious
of
my
own
ignorance
that
I
be
more
afraid
than
anxious
to
begin
.
<EOS>
now
I
know
you
be
here
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
I
find
myself
look
over
my
sketch
,
as
I
use
to
look
over
my
lesson
when
I
be
a
little
girl
,
and
when
I
be
sadly
afraid
that
I
should
turn
out
not
fit
to
be
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
make
the
confession
very
prettily
and
simply
,
and
,
with
quaint
,
childish
earnestness
,
draw
the
sketch
-
book
away
close
to
her
own
side
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
cut
the
knot
of
the
little
embarrassment
forthwith
,
in
her
resolute
,
downright
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
,
"
she
say
,
"
the
pupil
's
sketch
must
pass
through
the
fiery
ordeal
of
the
master
's
judgment
 
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
suppose
we
take
them
with
us
in
the
carriage
,
Laura
,
and
let
Mr.
Hartright
see
them
,
for
the
first
time
,
under
circumstance
of
perpetual
jolting
and
interruption
?
<EOS>
if
we
can
only
confuse
him
all
through
the
drive
,
between
Nature
as
it
be
,
when
he
look
up
at
the
view
,
and
Nature
as
it
be
not
when
he
look
down
again
at
our
sketch
-
book
,
we
shall
drive
him
into
the
last
desperate
refuge
of
pay
us
compliment
,
and
shall
slip
through
his
professional
finger
with
our
pet
feather
of
vanity
all
unruffled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mr.
Hartright
will
pay
me
no
compliment
,
"
say
Miss
Fairlie
,
as
we
all
leave
the
summer
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
venture
to
inquire
why
you
express
that
hope
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
shall
believe
all
that
you
say
to
me
,
"
she
answer
simply
.
  
<EOS>
in
those
few
word
she
unconsciously
give
me
the
key
to
her
whole
character
:
to
that
generous
trust
in
other
which
,
in
her
nature
,
grow
innocently
out
of
the
sense
of
her
own
truth
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
it
intuitively
then
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
by
experience
now
.
  
<EOS>
We
merely
wait
to
rouse
good
Mrs.
Vesey
from
the
place
which
she
still
occupy
at
the
deserted
luncheon
-
table
,
before
we
enter
the
open
carriage
for
our
promised
drive
.
<EOS>
the
old
lady
and
Miss
Halcombe
occupy
the
back
seat
,
and
Miss
Fairlie
and
<EOS>
I
sit
together
in
front
,
with
the
sketch
-
book
open
between
us
,
fairly
exhibit
at
last
to
my
professional
eye
.
<EOS>
all
serious
criticism
on
the
drawing
,
even
if
I
have
be
dispose
to
volunteer
it
,
be
render
impossible
by
Miss
Halcombe
's
lively
resolution
to
see
nothing
but
the
ridiculous
side
of
the
Fine
Arts
,
as
practise
by
herself
,
her
sister
,
and
lady
in
general
.
<EOS>
I
can
remember
the
conversation
that
pass
far
more
easily
than
the
sketch
that
I
mechanically
look
over
.
<EOS>
that
part
of
the
talk
,
especially
,
in
which
Miss
Fairlie
take
any
share
,
be
still
as
vividly
impressed
on
my
memory
as
if
I
have
hear
it
only
a
few
hour
ago
.
  
<EOS>
yes
!
let
me
acknowledge
that
on
this
first
day
I
let
the
charm
of
her
presence
lure
me
from
the
recollection
of
myself
and
my
position
.
<EOS>
the
most
trifling
of
the
question
that
she
put
to
me
,
on
the
subject
of
use
her
pencil
and
mix
her
colour
;
the
slight
alteration
of
expression
in
the
lovely
eye
that
look
into
mine
with
such
an
earnest
desire
to
learn
all
that
I
could
teach
,
and
to
discover
all
that
I
could
show
,
attract
more
of
my
attention
than
the
fine
view
we
pass
through
,
or
the
grand
change
of
light
and
shade
,
as
they
flow
into
each
other
over
the
wave
moorland
and
the
level
beach
.
<EOS>
at
any
time
,
and
under
any
circumstance
of
human
interest
,
be
it
not
strange
to
see
how
little
real
hold
the
object
of
the
natural
world
amid
which
we
live
can
gain
on
our
heart
and
mind
?
<EOS>
We
go
to
Nature
for
comfort
in
trouble
,
and
sympathy
in
joy
,
only
in
book
.
<EOS>
admiration
of
those
beauty
of
the
inanimate
world
,
which
modern
poetry
so
largely
and
so
eloquently
describe
,
be
not
,
even
in
the
good
of
us
,
one
of
the
original
instinct
of
our
nature
.
<EOS>
as
child
,
we
none
of
us
possess
it
.
<EOS>
no
uninstructed
man
or
woman
possess
it
.
<EOS>
those
whose
life
be
most
exclusively
pass
amid
the
ever
-
change
wonder
of
sea
and
land
be
also
those
who
be
most
universally
insensible
to
every
aspect
of
Nature
not
directly
associate
with
the
human
interest
of
their
calling

<EOS>
Our
capacity
of
appreciate
the
beauty
of
the
earth
we
live
on
be
,
in
truth
,
one
of
the
civilised
accomplishment
which
we
all
learn
as
an
art
;
and
,
more
,
that
very
capacity
be
rarely
practise
by
any
of
us
except
when
our
mind
be
most
indolent
and
most
unoccupied
.
<EOS>
how
much
share
have
the
attraction
of
Nature
ever
have
in
the
pleasurable
or
painful
interest
and
emotion
of
ourselves
or
our
friend
?
<EOS>
what
space
do
they
ever
occupy
in
the
thousand
little
narrative
of
personal
experience
which
pass
every
day
by
word
of
mouth
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
?
<EOS>
all
that
our
mind
can
compass
,
all
that
our
heart
can
learn
,
can
be
accomplish
with
equal
certainty
,
equal
profit
,
and
equal
satisfaction
to
ourselves
,
in
the
poor
as
in
the
rich
prospect
that
the
face
of
the
earth
can
show
.
<EOS>
there
be
surely
a
reason
for
this
want
of
inborn
sympathy
between
the
creature
and
the
creation
around
it
,
a
reason
which
may
perhaps
be
find
in
the
widely
-
differ
destiny
of
man
and
his
earthly
sphere
.
<EOS>
the
grand
mountain
prospect
that
the
eye
can
range
over
be
appoint
to
annihilation
.
<EOS>
the
small
human
interest
that
the
pure
heart
can
feel
be
appoint
to
immortality
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
be
out
nearly
three
hour
,
when
the
carriage
again
pass
through
the
gate
of
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
on
our
way
back
I
have
let
the
lady
settle
for
themselves
the
first
point
of
view
which
they
be
to
sketch
,
under
my
instruction
,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
when
they
withdraw
to
dress
for
dinner
,
and
when
I
be
alone
again
in
my
little
sitting
-
room
,
my
spirit
seem
to
leave
me
on
a
sudden
.
<EOS>
I
feel
ill
at
ease
and
dissatisfy
with
myself
,
I
hardly
know
why
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
be
now
conscious
for
the
first
time
of
have
enjoy
our
drive
too
much
in
the
character
of
a
guest
,
and
too
little
in
the
character
of
a
drawing
-
master
.
<EOS>
perhaps
that
strange
sense
of
something
want
,
either
in
Miss
Fairlie
or
in
myself
,
which
have
perplex
me
when
I
be
first
introduce
to
her
,
haunt
me
still
.
<EOS>
anyhow
,
it
be
a
relief
to
my
spirit
when
the
dinner
-
hour
call
me
out
of
my
solitude
,
and
take
me
back
to
the
society
of
the
lady
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
strike
,
on
enter
the
drawing
-
room
,
by
the
curious
contrast
,
rather
in
material
than
in
colour
,
of
the
dress
which
they
now
wear
.
<EOS>
while
Mrs.
Vesey
and
Miss
Halcombe
be
richly
clothe
(
each
in
the
manner
most
become
to
her
age
)
,
the
first
in
silver
-
grey
,
and
the
second
in
that
delicate
primrose
-
yellow
colour
which
match
so
well
with
a
dark
complexion
and
black
hair
,
Miss
Fairlie
be
unpretendingly
and
almost
poorly
dress
in
plain
white
muslin
.
<EOS>
It
be
spotlessly
pure
:
it
be
beautifully
put
on
;
but
still
it
be
the
sort
of
dress
which
the
wife
or
daughter
of
a
poor
man
may
have
wear
,
and
it
make
her
,
so
far
as
external
go
,
look
less
affluent
in
circumstance
than
her
own
governess
.
<EOS>
at
a
later
period
,
when
I
learn
to
know
more
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
character
,
I
discover
that
this
curious
contrast
,
on
the
wrong
side
,
be
due
to
her
natural
delicacy
of
feeling
and
natural
intensity
of
aversion
to
the
slight
personal
display
of
her
own
wealth
.
<EOS>
neither
Mrs.
Vesey
nor
Miss
Halcombe
could
ever
induce
her
to
let
the
advantage
in
<EOS>
dress
desert
the
two
lady
who
be
poor
,
to
lean
to
the
side
of
the
one
lady
who
be
rich
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
dinner
be
over
we
return
together
to
the
drawing

room
.
<EOS>
although
Mr.
Fairlie
(
emulate
the
magnificent
condescension
of
the
monarch
who
have
pick
up
Titian
's
brush
for
him
)
have
instruct
his
butler
to
consult
my
wish
in
relation
to
the
wine
that
I
may
prefer
after
dinner
,
I
be
resolute
enough
to
resist
the
temptation
of
sit
in
solitary
grandeur
among
bottle
of
my
own
choosing
,
and
sensible
enough
to
ask
the
lady
'
permission
to
leave
the
table
with
them
habitually
,
on
the
civilised
foreign
plan

during

with

good
Mrs.

take
possession
of
an

in
a

off
comfortably
to

<EOS>
at
my
request
Miss
Fairlie
place
herself
at
the
piano
.
<EOS>
as
I
follow
her
to
a
seat
near
the
instrument
,
I
see
Miss
Halcombe
retire
into
a
recess
of
one
of
the
side
window
,
to
proceed
with
the
search
through
her
mother
's
letter
by
the
last
quiet
ray
of
the
evening
light

<EOS>
how
vividly

peaceful

picture
of

come
back
to
me
while
I
write
!
<EOS>
from
the
place
where
I
sit
I
could
see
Miss
Halcombe
's
graceful
figure
,
half
of
it
in
soft
light
,
half
in
mysterious
shadow
,
bend
intently
over
the
letter
in
her
lap
;
while
,
near
to
me
,
the
fair
profile
of
the
player
at
the
piano
be
just
delicately
define
against
the
faintly
-
deepen
background
of
the
inner
wall
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
outside
,
on
the
terrace
,
the
cluster
flower
and
long
grass
and
creeper
wave
so
gently
in
the
light
evening
air
,
that
the
sound
of
their
rustling
never
reach
us
.
<EOS>
the
sky
be
without
a
cloud
,
and
the
dawn
mystery
of
moonlight
begin
to
tremble
already
in
the
region
of
the
eastern
heaven
.
<EOS>
the
sense
of
peace
and
seclusion
soothe
all
thought
and
feel
into
a
rapt
,
unearthly
repose
;
and
the
balmy
quiet
,
that
deepen
ever
with
the
deepen
light
,
seem
to
hover
over
us
with
a
gentle
influence
still
,
when
there
steal
upon
it
from
the
piano
the
heavenly
tenderness
of
the
music
of
Mozart
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
evening
of
sight
and
sound
never
to
forget
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
sit
silent
in
the
place
we
have
choose
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
still
sleep
,
Miss
Fairlie
still
play
,
Miss
Halcombe

till

<EOS>
by
this
time
the
moon
have
steal
round
to
the
terrace
,
and
soft
,
mysterious
ray
of
light
be
slant
already
across
the
low
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
change
from
the
twilight
obscurity
be
so
beautiful
that
we
banish
the
lamp
,
by
common
consent
,
when
the
servant
bring
them
in
,
and
keep
the
large
room
unlighte
,
except
by
the
glimmer
of
the
two
candle
at

<EOS>
for
half
an
hour
more

still
go
on
.
<EOS>
after
that
the
beauty
of
the
moonlight
view
on
the
terrace
tempt
Miss
Fairlie
out
to
look
at
it

<EOS>
when
the

Miss
Halcombe
have
change
her
place
,
so
as
to
continue
her
examination
of
the

by
their
assistance

<EOS>
We
leave
her
,
on
a
low
chair
,
at
one
side
of
the
instrument
,
so
absorb
over
her
reading
that
she
do
not
seem
to
notice
when
we
move

<EOS>
We
have
be
out
on

together
,
just
in

hardly
so
long
as
five

I
should
think

and
Miss

be
,
by
my
advice
,
just
tie
her
white
handkerchief
over
her
head
as
a
precaution
against
the
night
air
 
when
I
hear
Miss

pronounce

<EOS>
on

in

there

a
look
in

face
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
describe
it
 
which
suggest
to
me
that
she
have
something

<EOS>
She

altogether
what
you
would
call
a

Her

<EOS>
Mrs.

may
die
in
a
week

time
,
or
may
linger
on
for
month
;
and
Mrs.
Catherick
's
object
be

once
more
Miss

out

I
have
take
a
violent
fancy
,
Philip
,
to
my
new
scholar
,
for
a
reason
which
I
mean
to
keep
till
the
last
for
the
sake
of
surprise
you
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
have
tell
me
as
little
about
the
child
as
she
tell
me
of
herself
,
I
be
leave
to
discover
(
which
I
do
on
the
first
day
when
we
try
her
at
lesson
)
that
the
poor
little
thing
's
intellect
be
not
develop
as
it
ought
to
be
at
her
age
.
<EOS>
see
this
I
have
her
up
to
the
house
the
next
day
,
and
privately
arrange
with
the
doctor
to
come
and
watch
her
and
question
her
,
and
tell
me
what
he
think
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
be
that
she
will
grow
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
he
say
her
careful
bringing
-
up
at
school
be
a
matter
of
great
importance
just
now
,
because
her
unusual
slowness
in
acquire
idea
imply
an
unusual
tenacity
in
keep
them
,
when
they
be
once
receive
into
her
mind
.
<EOS>
now
,
my
love

you
must
not
imagine
,
in
your
off
-
hand
way
,
that
I
have
be
attach
myself
to
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
this
poor
little
Anne
Catherick
be
a
sweet
,
affectionate
,
grateful
girl
,
and
say
the
quaint
,
prettiest
thing
(
as
you
shall
judge
by
an
instance
)
,
in
the
most
oddly
sudden
,
surprised
,
half
-
frightened
way
.
<EOS>
although
she
be
dress
very
neatly
,
her
clothe
show
a
sad
want
of
taste
in
colour
and
pattern
.
<EOS>
so
I
arrange
,
yesterday
,
that
some
of
our
darling
Laura
's
old
white
frock
and
white
hat
should
be
alter
for
Anne
Catherick
,
explain
to
her
that
little
girl
of
her
complexion
look
neater
and
better
all
in
white
than
in
anything
else
.
<EOS>
She
hesitate
and
seem
puzzled
for
a
minute
,
then
flush
up
,
and
appear
to
understand
.
<EOS>
Her
little
hand
clasp
mine
suddenly
.
<EOS>
She
kiss
it
,
Philip
,
and
say
(
oh
,
so
earnestly
!
)
,
"
I
will
always
wear
white
as
long
as
I
live
.
<EOS>
It
will
help
me
to
remember
you
,
madam
,
and
to
think
that
I
be
please
you
still
,
when
I
go
away
and
see
you
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
only
one
speciman
of
the
quaint
thing
she
say
so
prettily
.
<EOS>
poor
little
soul
!
<EOS>
She
shall
have
a
stock
of
white
frock
,
make
with
good
deep
tuck
,
to
let
out
for
her
as
she
grow
 
"
"
  
Miss
Halcombe
pause
,
and
look
at
me
across
the
piano
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
the
forlorn
woman
whom
you
meet
in
the
high
-
road
seem
young
?
"
she
ask
.
<EOS>
"
young
enough
to
be
two-
or
three
-
and
-
twenty
?
"
  
"
yes
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
as
young
as
that
.
"
  
"
and
she
be
strangely
dress
,
from
head
to
foot
,
all
in
white
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
all
in
white
.
"
  
while
the
answer
be
pass
my
lip
Miss
Fairlie
glide
into
view
on
the
terrace
for
the
third
time
.
<EOS>
instead
of
proceed
on
her
walk
,
she
stop
,
with
her
back
turn
towards
us
,
and
,
lean
on
the
balustrade
of
the
terrace
,
look
down
into
the
garden
beyond
.
<EOS>
My
eye
fix
upon
the
white
gleam
of
her
muslin
gown
and
head
-
dress
in
the
moonlight
,
and
a
sensation
,
for
which
I
can
find
no
name
 
a
sensation
that
quicken
my
pulse
,
and
raise
a
fluttering
at
my
heart
 
begin
to
steal
over
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
in
white
?
"
Miss
Halcombe
repeat
.
<EOS>
"
the
most
important
sentence
in
the
letter
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
be
those
at
the
end
,
which
I
will
read
to
you
immediately
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
help
dwell
a
little
upon
the
coincidence
of
the
white
costume
of
the
woman
you
meet
,
and
the
white
frock
which
produce
that
strange
answer
from
my
mother
's
little
scholar
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
may
have
be
wrong
when
he
discover
the
child
's
defect
of
intellect
,
and
predict
that
she
would
"
grow
out
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
She
may
never
have
grow
out
of
them
,
and
the
old
grateful
fancy
about
dress
in
white
,
which
be
a
serious
feeling
to
the
girl
,
may
be
a
serious
feeling
to
the
woman
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
a
few
word
in
answer
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
.
<EOS>
all
my
attention
be
concentrate
on
the
white
gleam
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
muslin
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
listen
to
the
last
sentence
of
the
letter
,
"
say
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
will
surprise
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
she
raise
the
letter
to
the
light
of
the
candle
,
Miss
Fairlie
turn
from
the
balustrade
,
look
doubtfully
up
and
down
the
terrace
,
advance
a
step
towards
the
glass
door
,
and
then
stop
,
face
us
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
Miss
Halcombe
read
me
the
last
sentence
to
which
she
have
refer
    
"
"
and
now
,
my
love
,
see
that
I
be
at
the
end
of
my
paper
,
now
for
the
real
reason
,
the
surprising
reason
,
for
my
fondness
for
little
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Philip
,
although
she
be
not
half
so
pretty
,
she
be
,
nevertheless
,
by
one
of
those
extraordinary
caprice
of
accidental
resemblance
which
one
sometimes
see
,
the
live
likeness
,
in
her
hair
,
her
complexion
,
the
colour
of
her
eye
,
and
the
shape
of
her
face
 
"
<EOS>
"
  
I
start
up
from
the
ottoman
before
Miss
Halcombe
could
pronounce
the
next
word
.
<EOS>
a
thrill
of
the
same
feeling
which
run
through
me
when
the
touch
be
lay
upon
my
shoulder
on
the
lonely
high
-
road
chill
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
there
stand
Miss
Fairlie
,
a
white
figure
,
alone
in
the
moonlight
;
in
her
attitude
,
in
the
turn
of
her
head
,
in
her
complexion
,
in
the
shape
of
her
face
,
the
living
image
,
at
that
distance
and
under
those
circumstance
,
of
the
woman
in
white
!
<EOS>
the
doubt
which
have
trouble
my
mind
for
hour
and
hour
past
flash
into
conviction
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
that
"
something
want
"
be
my
own
recognition
of
the
ominous
likeness
between
the
fugitive
from
the
asylum
and
my
pupil
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
it
!
"
say
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
She
drop
the
useless
letter
,
and
her
eye
flash
as
they
meet
mine
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
it
now
,
as
my
mother
see
it
eleven
year
since
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
 
more
unwillingly
than
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
to
associate
that
forlorn
,
friendless
,
lose
woman
,
even
by
an
accidental
likeness
only
,
with
Miss
Fairlie
,
seem
like
cast
a
shadow
on
the
future
of
the
bright
creature
who
stand
look
at
us
now
.
<EOS>
let
me
lose
the
impression
again
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
call
her
in
,
out
of
the
dreary
moonlight
 
<EOS>
pray
call
her
in
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Hartright
,
you
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
whatever
woman
may
be
,
I
think
that
man
,
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
be
above
superstition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pray
call
her
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
hush
,
hush
!
<EOS>
She
be
come
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
say
nothing
in
her
presence
.
<EOS>
let
this
discovery
of
the
likeness
be
keep
a
secret
between
you
and
me

<EOS>
come
in
,
Laura
,
come
in
,
and
wake
Mrs.
Vesey
with
the
piano
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
be

for
some
more
music
,
and
he
want
it
,
this
time
,
of
the
light
and
lively
kind

"
    
<EOS>
so
end
my
eventful
first
day
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
and
I
keep
our
secret
.
<EOS>
after
the
discovery
of
the
likeness
no
fresh
light
seem
destine
to
break
over
the
mystery
of
the
woman
in
white
.
<EOS>
at
the
first
safe
opportunity
Miss
Halcombe
cautiously
lead
her
half
-
sister
to
speak
of
their
mother
,
of
old
time
,
and
of
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
's
recollection
of
the
little
scholar
at
Limmeridge
be
,
however
,
only
of
the
most
vague
and
general
kind
.
<EOS>
She
remember
the
likeness
between
herself
and
her
mother
's
favourite
pupil
,
as
something
which
have
be
suppose
to
exist
in
past
time
;
but
she
do
not
refer
to
the
gift
of
the
white
dress
,
or
to
the
singular
form
of
word
in
which
the
child
have
artlessly
express
her
gratitude
for
them
.
<EOS>
She
remember
that
Anne
have
remain
at
Limmeridge
for
a
few
month
only
,
and
have
then
leave
it
to
go
back
to
her
home
in
Hampshire
;
but
she
could
not
say
whether
the
mother
and
daughter
have
ever
return
,
or
have
ever
be
hear
of
afterwards
.
<EOS>
no
further
search
,
on
Miss
Halcombe
's
part
,
through
the
few
letter
of
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
writing
which
she
have
leave
unread
,
assist
in
clear
up
the
uncertainty
still
leave
to
perplex
us
.
<EOS>
We
have
identify
the
unhappy
woman
whom
I
have
meet
in
the
night
-
time
with
Anne
Catherick
 
<EOS>
we
have
make
some
advance
,
at
least
,
towards
connect
the
probably
defective
condition
of
the
poor
creature
's
intellect
with
the
peculiarity
of
her
be
dress
all
in
white
,
and
with
the
continuance
,
in
her
maturer
year
,
of
her
childish
gratitude
towards
Mrs.
Fairlie
 
<EOS>
and
there
,
so
far
as
we
know
at
that
time
,
our
discovery
have
end
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
pass
on
,
the
week
pass
on
,
and
the
track
of
the
golden
autumn
wind
its
bright
way
visibly
through
the
green
summer
of
the
tree
.
<EOS>
peaceful
,
fast
-
flow
,
happy
time
!
<EOS>
my
story
glide
by
you
now
as
swiftly
as
you
once
glide
by
me
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
treasure
of
enjoyment
that
you
pour
so
freely
into
my
heart
,
how
much
be
leave
me
that
have
purpose
and
value
enough
to
be
write
on
this
page
?
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
saddest
of
all
confession
that
a
man
can
make
 
the
confession
of
his
own
folly
.
  
<EOS>
the
secret
which
that
confession
disclose
should
be
tell
with
little
effort
,
for
it
have
indirectly
escape
me
already
.
<EOS>
the
poor
weak
word
,
which
have
fail
to
describe
Miss
Fairlie
,
have
succeed
in
betray
the
sensation
she
awaken
in
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
with
us
all
.
<EOS>
Our
word
be
giant
when
they
do
us
an
injury
,
and
dwarf
when
they
do
us
a
service
.
  
<EOS>
I
love
her
.
  
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
how
well
I
know
all
the
sadness
and
all
the
mockery
that
be
contain
in
those
three
word
.
<EOS>
I
can
sigh
over
my
mournful
confession
with
the
tender
woman
who
read
it
and
pity
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
laugh
at
it
as
bitterly
as
the
hard
man
who
toss
it
from
him
in
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
love
her
!
<EOS>
feel
for
me
,
or
despise
me
,
I
confess
it
with
the
same
immovable
resolution
to
own
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
be
there
no
excuse
for
me
?
<EOS>
there
be
some
excuse
to
be
find
,
surely
,
in
the
condition
under
which
my
term
of
hire
service
be
pass
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
My
morning
hour
succeed
each
other
calmly
in
the
quiet
and
seclusion
of
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
work
enough
to
do
,
in
mount
my
employer
's
drawing
,
to
keep
my
hand
and
eye
pleasurably
employ
,
while
my
mind
be
leave
free
to
enjoy
the
dangerous
luxury
of
its
own
unbridled
thought
.
<EOS>
a
perilous
solitude
,
for
it
last
long
enough
to
enervate
,
not
long
enough
to
fortify
me
.
<EOS>
a
perilous
solitude
,
for
it
be
follow
by
afternoon
and
evening
spend
,
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
alone
in
the
society
of
two
woman
,
one
of
whom
possess
all
the
accomplishment
of
grace
,
wit
,
and
high
-
breeding
,
the
other
all
the
charm
of
beauty
,
gentleness
,
and
simple
truth
,
that
can
purify
and
subdue
the
heart
of
man
.
<EOS>
not
a
day
pass
,
in
that
dangerous
intimacy
of
teacher
and
pupil
,
in
which
my
hand
be
not
close
to
Miss
Fairlie
's
;
my
cheek
,
as
we
bend
together
over
her
sketch
-
book
,
almost
touch
her
.
<EOS>
the
more
attentively
she
watch
every
movement
of
my
brush
,
the
more
closely
I
be
breathe
the
perfume
of
her
hair
,
and
the
warm
fragrance
of
her
breath
.
<EOS>
It
be
part
of
my
service
to
live
in
the
very
light
of
her
eye
 
at
one
time
to
be
bend
over
her
,
so
close
to
her
bosom
as
to
tremble
at
the
thought
of
touch
it
;
at
another
,
to
feel
her
bend
over
me
,
bend
so
close
to
see
what
I
be
about
,
that
her
voice
sink
low
when
she
speak
to
me
,
and
her
ribbon
brush
my
cheek
in
the
wind
before
she
could
draw
them
back
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
which
follow
the
sketching
excursion
of
the
afternoon
vary
,
rather
than
check
,
these
innocent
,
these
inevitable
familiarity
.
<EOS>
My
natural
fondness
for
the
music
which
she
play
with
such
tender
feeling
,
such
delicate
womanly
taste
,
and
her
natural
enjoyment
of
give
me
back
,
by
the
practice
of
her
art
,
the
pleasure
which
I
have
offer
to
her
by
the
practice
of
mine
,
only
wove
another
tie
which
draw
us
closer
and
closer
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
the
accident
of
conversation
;
the
simple
habit
which
regulate
even
such
a
little
thing
as
the
position
of
our
place
at
table
;
the
play
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
ever
-
ready
raillery
,
always
direct
against
my
anxiety
as
teacher
,
while
it
sparkle
over
her
enthusiasm
as
pupil
;
the
harmless
expression
of
poor
Mrs.
Vesey
's
drowsy
approval
,
which
connect
Miss
Fairlie
and
me
as
two
model
young
people
who
never
disturb
her
 
every
one
of
these
trifle
,
and
many
more
,
combine
to
fold
us
together
in
the
same
domestic
atmosphere
,
and
to
lead
us
both
insensibly
to
the
same
hopeless
end
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
remember
my
position
,
and
have
put
myself
secretly
on
my
guard
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
but
not
till
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
all
the
discretion
,
all
the
experience
,
which
have
avail
me
with
other
woman
,
and
secure
me
against
other
temptation
,
fail
me
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
my
profession
,
for
year
past
,
to
be
in
this
close
contact
with
young
girl
of
all
age
,
and
of
all
order
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
have
accept
the
position
as
part
of
my
calling
in
life
;
I
have
train
myself
to
leave
all
the
sympathy
natural
to
my
age
in
my
employer
's
outer
hall
,
as
coolly
as
I
leave
my
umbrella
there
before
I
go
upstairs
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
since
learn
to
understand
,
composedly
and
as
a
matter
of
course
,
that
my
situation
in
life
be
consider
a
guarantee
against
any
of
my
female
pupil
feel
more
than
the
most
ordinary
interest
in
me
,
and
that
I
be
admit
among
beautiful
and
captivate
woman
much
as
a
harmless
domestic
animal
<EOS>
be
admit
among
them
.
<EOS>
this
guardian
experience
I
have
gain
early
;
this
guardian
experience
have
sternly
and
strictly
guide
me
straight
along
my
own
poor
narrow
path
,
without
once
let
me
stray
aside
,
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
and
my
trusty
talisman
be
part
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
yes
,
my
hardly
-
earn
self
-
control
be
as
completely
lose
to
me
as
if
I
have
never
possess
it
;
lose
to
me
,
as
it
be
lose
every
day
to
other
man
,
in
other
critical
situation
,
where
woman
be
concerned
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
now
,
that
I
should
have
question
myself
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
ask
why
any
room
in
the
house
be
well
than
home
to
me
when
she
enter
it
,
and
barren
as
a
desert
when
she
go
out
again
 
why
I
always
notice
and
remember
the
little
change
in
her
dress
that
I
have
notice
and
remember
in
no
other
woman
's
before
 
why
I
see
her
,
hear
her
,
and
touch
her
(
when
we
shake
hand
at
night
and
morning
)
as
I
have
never
see
,
hear
,
and
touch
any
other
woman
in
my
life
?
<EOS>
I
should
have
look
into
my
own
heart
,
and
find
this
new
growth
spring
up
there
,
and
pluck
it
out
while
it
be
young
.
<EOS>
why
be
this
easy
,
simple
work
of
self
-
culture
always
too
much
for
me
?
<EOS>
the
explanation
have
be
write
already
in
the
three
word
that
be
many
enough
,
and
plain
enough
,
for
my
confession
.
<EOS>
I
love
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
pass
,
the
week
pass
;
it
be
approach
the
third
month
of
my
stay
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
the
delicious
monotony
of
life
in
our
calm
seclusion
flow
on
with
me
,
like
a
smooth
stream
with
a
swimmer
who
glide
down
the
current
.
<EOS>
all
memory
of
the
past
,
all
think
of
the
future
,
all
sense
of
the
falseness
and
hopelessness
of
my
own
position
,
lie
hush
within
me
into
deceitful
rest
.
<EOS>
lull
by
the
Syren
-
song
that
my
own
heart
sing
to
me
,
with
eye
shut
to
all
sight
,
and
ear
close
to
all
sound
of
danger
,
I
drift
nearer
and
near
to
the
fatal
rock
.
<EOS>
the
warning
that
arouse
me
at
last
,
and
startle
me
into
sudden
,
self
-
accuse
consciousness
of
my
own
weakness
,
be
the
plain
,
the
true
,
the
kind
of
all
warning
,
for
it
come
silently
from
HER
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
part
one
night
as
usual
.
<EOS>
no
word
have
fall
from
my
lip
,
at
that
time
or
at
any
time
before
it
,
that
could
betray
me
,
or
startle
her
into
sudden
knowledge
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
but
when
we
meet
again
in
the
morning
,
a
change
have
come
over
her
 
a
change
that
tell
me
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
shrink
then
 
<EOS>
I
shrink
still
 
from
invade
the
innermost
sanctuary
of
her
heart
,
and
lay
it
open
to
other
,
as
I
have
lay
open
my
own
.
<EOS>
let
it
be
enough
to
say
that
the
time
when
she
first
surprise
my
secret
be
,
I
firmly
believe
,
the
time
when
she
first
surprise
her
own
,
and
the
time
,
also
,
when
she
change
towards
me
in
the
interval
of
one
night
.
<EOS>
Her
nature
,
too
truthful
to
deceive
other
,
be
too
noble
to
deceive
itself
.
<EOS>
when
the
doubt
that
I
have
hush
asleep
first
lay
its
weary
weight
on
her
heart
,
the
true
face
own
all
,
and
say
,
in
its
own
frank
,
simple
language
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
him
;
I
be
sorry
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>
It
say
this
,
and
more
,
which
I
could
not
then
interpret
.
<EOS>
I
understand
but
too
well
the
change
in
her
manner
,
to
great
kindness
and
quick
readiness
in
interpret
all
my
wish
,
before
other
 
to
constraint
and
sadness
,
and
nervous
anxiety
to
absorb
herself
in
the
first
occupation
she
could
seize
on
,
whenever
we
happen
to
be
leave
together
alone
.
<EOS>
I
understand
why
the
sweet
sensitive
lip
smile
so
rarely
and
so
restrainedly
now
,
and
why
the
clear
blue
eye
look
at
me
,
sometimes
with
the
pity
of
an
angel
,
sometimes
with
the
innocent
perplexity
of
a
child
.
<EOS>
but
the
change
mean
more
than
this
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
coldness
in
her
hand
,
there
be
an
unnatural
immobility
in
her
face
,
there
be
in
all
her
movement
the
mute
expression
of
constant
fear
and
cling
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
the
sensation
that
I
could
trace
to
herself
and
to
me
,
the
unacknowledged
sensation
that
we
be
feel
in
common
,
be
not
these
.
<EOS>
there
be
certain
element
of
the
change
in
her
that
be
still
secretly
draw
us
together
,
and
other
that
be
,
as
secretly
,
begin
to
drive
us
apart
.
  
<EOS>
in
my
doubt
and
perplexity
,
in
my
vague
suspicion
of
something
hide
which
I
be
leave
to
find
by
my
own
unaided
effort
,
I
examine
Miss
Halcombe
's
look
and
manner
for
enlightenment
.
<EOS>
live
in
such
intimacy
as
our
,
no
serious
alteration
could
take
place
in
any
one
of
us
which
do
not
sympathetically
affect
the
other
.
<EOS>
the
change
in
Miss
Fairlie
be
reflect
in
her
half
-
sister
.
<EOS>
although
not
a
word
escape
Miss
Halcombe
which
hint
at
an
altered
state
of
feeling
towards
myself
,
her
penetrating
eye
have
contract
a
new
habit
of
always
watch
me
.
<EOS>
sometimes
the
look
be
like
suppress
anger
,
sometimes
like
suppress
dread
,
sometimes
like
neither
 
like
nothing
,
in
short
,
which
I
could
understand
.
<EOS>
a
week
elapse
,
leave
us
all
three
still
in
this
position
of
secret
constraint
towards
one
another
.
<EOS>
My
situation
,
aggravate
by
the
sense
of
my
own
miserable
weakness
and
forgetfulness
of
myself
,
now
too
late
awaken
in
me
,
be
become
intolerable
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
must
cast
off
the
oppression
under
which
I
be
live
,
at
once
and
for
ever
 
yet
how
to
act
for
the
good
,
or
what
to
say
first
,
be
more
than
I
could
tell
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
position
of
helplessness
and
humiliation
I
be
rescue
by
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
Her
lip
tell
me
the
bitter
,
the
necessary
,
the
unexpected
truth
;
her
hearty
kindness
sustain
me
under
the
shock
of
hear
it
;
her
sense
and
courage
turn
to
its
right
use
an
event
which
threaten
the
bad
that
could
happen
,
to
me
and
to
other
,
in
Limmeridge
House
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
on
a
Thursday
in
the
week
,
and
nearly
at
the
end
of
the
third
month
of
my
sojourn
in
Cumberland
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
when
I
go
down
into
the
breakfast
-
room
at
the
usual
hour
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
for
the
first
time
since
I
have
know
her
,
be
absent
from
her
customary
place
at
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
be
out
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
She
bow
to
me
,
but
do
not
come
in
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
have
drop
from
my
lip
,
or
from
hers
,
that
could
unsettle
either
of
us
 
and
yet
<EOS>
the
same
unacknowledged
sense
of
embarrassment
make
us
shrink
alike
from
meet
one
another
alone
.
<EOS>
She
wait
on
the
lawn
,
and
I
wait
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
till
Mrs.
Vesey
or
Miss
Halcombe
come
in
.
<EOS>
how
quickly
I
should
have
join
her
:
how
readily
we
should
have
shake
hand
,
and
glide
into
our
customary
talk
,
only
a
fortnight
ago
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
Miss
Halcombe
enter
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
preoccupied
look
,
and
she
make
her
apology
for
be
late
rather
absently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
detain
,
"
she
say
,
"
by
a
consultation
with
Mr.
Fairlie
on
a
domestic
matter
which
he
wish
to
speak
to
me
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
come
in
from
the
garden
,
and
the
usual
morning
greeting
pass
between
us
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
strike
cold
to
mine
than
ever
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
look
at
me
,
and
she
be
very
pale
.
<EOS>
even
Mrs.
Vesey
notice
it
when
she
enter
the
room
a
moment
after
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
the
change
in
the
wind
,
"
say
the
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
winter
be
come
 
ah
,
my
love
,
the
winter
be
come
soon
!
"
  
<EOS>
in
her
heart
and
in
mine
it
have
come
already
!
  
<EOS>
Our
morning
meal
 
once
so
full
of
pleasant
good
-
humoured
discussion
of
the
plan
for
the
day
 
be
short
and
silent
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
seem
to
feel
the
oppression
of
the
long
pause
in
the
conversation
,
and
look
appealingly
to
her
sister
to
fill
them
up
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
,
after
once
or
twice
hesitate
and
check
herself
,
in
a
most
uncharacteristic
manner
,
speak
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
your
uncle
this
morning
,
Laura
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
He
think
the
purple
room
be
the
one
that
ought
to
be
get
ready
,
and
he
confirm
what
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Monday
be
the
day
 
not
Tuesday

"
  
while
these
word
be
be
speak
Miss
Fairlie
look
down
at
the
table
beneath
her
.
<EOS>
Her
finger
move
nervously
among
the
crumb
that
be
scatter
on
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
the
paleness
on
her
cheek
spread
to
her
lip
,
and
the
lip
themselves
tremble
visibly
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
the
only
person
present
who
notice
this
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
see
it
,
too
,
and
at
once
set
us
the
example
of
rise
from
table
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
and
Miss
Fairlie
leave
the
room
together
.
<EOS>
the
kind
sorrowful
blue
eye
look
at
me
,
for
a
moment
,
with
the
prescient
sadness
of
a
coming
and
a
long
farewell
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
answering
pang
in
my
own
heart
 
<EOS>
the
pang
that
tell
me
I
must
lose
her
soon
,
and
love
her
the
more
unchangeably
for
the
loss
.
  
<EOS>
I
turn
towards

comprehensive
sweep

<EOS>
She
lead
me
across
the
lawn
,
along
the

path
by
which
I
have
follow
her
on
the
day
after
my
arrival
at
Limmeridge
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
little
summer
-
house

in
which
Laura
Fairlie
and
I
have
first
see
each

she
stop
,

break
the
silence

the
chair
at
the
little
round
table
inside
,

<EOS>
I
suspect
what
be
come
when
she

to
me
in

breakfast

I

"
Mr.

,
"
I
be
go
to

a
frank
avowal

you

<EOS>
I
be
go
to
say
 
without
phrase

making
,
which
I
detest
,
or
pay
compliment
,
which
I
heartily
despise
 
that
I
have
come

in
the
course
of
your
residence
with
us
,
to
feel
a
strong
friendly
regard
for
you

<EOS>
I
be
predispose
in
your
favour
when
you
first
tell
me
of
your
conduct
towards
that
unhappy
woman
whom
you
meet
under
such
remarkable
circumstance

<EOS>
Your
management
of
the
affair
may
not
have
be
prudent
,
but
it
show
the
self

control
,
the
delicacy
,
and
the
compassion
of
a
man
who
be
naturally
a
gentleman

It
make
me
expect
good
thing
from
you

you
have
not
disappoint
my
expectation

<EOS>
She
pause
 
but
hold
up
her
hand
at
the

time
,
as
a
sign
that
she
await
no
answer
from

now

Miss

<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
,
you
have
thoughtlessly
allow
yourself
to
form
an
attachment
 
<EOS>
a
serious
and
devoted
attachment
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
 
to
my
sister
Laura
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
put
you
to
the
pain
of
confess
it
in
so
many
word
,
because
I
see
and
know
that
you
be
too
honest
to
deny
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
even
blame
you
 
<EOS>
I
pity
you
for
open
your
heart
to
a
hopeless
affection
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
attempt
to
take
any
underhand
advantage
 
<EOS>
you
have
not
speak
to
my
sister
in
secret
.
<EOS>
You
be
guilty
of
weakness
and
want
of
attention
to
your
own
good
interest
,
but
of
nothing
bad
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
act
,
in
any
single
respect
,
less
delicately
and
less
modestly
,
I
should
have
tell
you
to
leave
the
house
without
an
instant
's
notice
,
or
an
instant
's
consultation
of
anybody
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
blame
the
misfortune
of
your
year
and
your
position
 
I
do
not
blame
you
.
<EOS>
shake
hand
 
<EOS>
I
have
give
you
pain
;
I
be
go
to
give
you
more
,
but
there
be
no
help
for
it
 
<EOS>
shake
hand
with
your
friend
,
Marian
Halcombe
,
first

"
  
<EOS>
the
sudden
kindness
 
the
warm
,
high

minded
,
fearless
sympathy
which
meet
me
on
such
mercifully
equal
term
,
which
appeal
with
such
delicate
and
generous
abruptness
straight
to
my
heart
,
my
honour

and
my
courage

overcome
me
in
an

<EOS>
I

look
at
her

I

let
us
get

over
at

.
<EOS>
It
be
a
real
true
relief
to
me
that
I
be
not

,
in
what
I
have
now
to
say
,
to
enter
into
the
question
 
the
hard

cruel
question
as
I
think
it
 
of
social
inequality
.
<EOS>
circumstance
which
will
try
you
to
the
quick
,
spare
me
the
ungracious
necessity
of
pain
a
man
who
have
live
in
friendly
intimacy
under
the

roof
with
myself
by
any
humiliating
reference
to
matter
of
rank

station

<EOS>
You
must
leave
Limmeridge
House
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
before
more
harm
be
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
duty
to
say
that
to
you
;
and
it
would
be
equally
my
duty
to
say
it
,
under
precisely
the
same
serious
necessity
,
if
you
be
the
representative
of
the
old
and
wealthy
family
in
England
.
<EOS>
You
must
leave

She

a
moment
,
turn
her
face
full
on
me
,
and
reach
across
the
table
,
lay
her
hand
firmly

<EOS>
"
not

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
My

Would

<EOS>
I

tighten
its

<EOS>
I
raise

Her

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
We

prove
my
gratitude
in

if
I
can
prove

<EOS>

You

by

<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
,
concealment

at
an
end
between

<EOS>
I
can
not
affect
to
hide
from
you
what
my
sister
have
unconsciously
show
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
must
leave
us
for
her
sake
,
as
well
as
for
your
own
.
<EOS>
Your
presence
here
,
your
necessary
intimacy
with
us

harmless
as
it
have
be
,
God
know
,
in
all
other
respect
,
have
unsteady
her
and
make
her
wretched
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
love
her
better
than
my
own
life
 
<EOS>
I
,
who
have
learn
to
believe
in
that
pure
,
noble
,
innocent
nature
as
I
believe
in
my
religion
 
know
<EOS>
but
too
well
the
secret
misery
of
self
-
reproach
that
she
have
be
suffer
since
the
first
shadow
of
a
feel
disloyal
to
her
marriage
engagement
enter
her
heart
in
spite
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
 
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
say
it
after
what
have
happen
 
that
her
engagement
have
ever
have
a
strong
hold
on
her
affection
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
engagement
of
honour
,
not
of
love
;
her
father
sanction
it
on
his
deathbed
,
two
year
since
;
she
herself
neither
welcome
it
nor
shrink
from
it
 
<EOS>
she
be
content
to
make
it
.
<EOS>
till
you
come
here
she
be
in
the
position
of
hundred
of
other
woman
,
who
marry
man
without
be
greatly
attract
to
them
or
greatly
repel
by
them

and
who
learn
to
love
them
(
when
they
do
not
learn
to
hate

)
<EOS>
after
marriage
,
instead
of
before

<EOS>
I
hope
more
earnestly
than
word
can
say
 
<EOS>
and
you
should
have
the
self
-
sacrifice
courage
to
hope
too
 
that
the
new
thought
and
feeling
which
have
disturb
the
old
calmness
and
the
old
content
have
not
take
root
too
deeply
to
be
ever

<EOS>
Your
absence
(
if
I
have
less
belief
in
your
honour
,
and
your
courage
,
and
your
sense

I
should
not
trust
to
them
as
I

now

<EOS>
your
absence
will
help
my
effort
,
and
time
will
help
us
all

<EOS>
It
be
something
to
know
that
my

It

the
only
reason
you
can
assign
to
Mr.
Fairlie
for
your
departure
,
before
the
end

must
be
that
an
unforeseen
necessity
compel
you
to
ask
his
permission

return
at

London

You

from
the
moment
when
I
have
discover
that
the

visitor
at

Miss

husband
,
I
have
feel
a
bitter
curiosity
,
a
burn
envious
eagerness
,
to
know
who
he
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
possible
that
a
future
opportunity

put
the

risk
ask
it

(
I
hesitate
 
I
have
force
myself
to
think
of
him

it
be
hard
still
to
speak
of
him

as
her

who

Her

Miss

hasten
immediately
to
her

I
withdraw
to
my
studio
to
set
in

all

that
I
have
not

<EOS>
there
be
hundred

I

yet
,
I
do
connect
him

be
it
because
he
have
now
become
associated

Miss

being
,
in

associate

Anne

since
the
night

I
have
discover
the

likeness
between

have
the
event

the
morning
so
unnerve
me
already

I
be
at

common
chance

common
coincidence
may
suggest
to
my
imagination

<EOS>
impossible
to

I
could
only
feel

what
have

even
my

be
powerless

asunder

the

more
darkly

Poignant
as
it

the
sense
of
suffering
cause
by
the
miserable
end

my
brief

presumptuous

seem
to

blunt

the

weak

such
step

be
a
question

shut
up

that

at

it
be
surely
too
incoherent

be

<EOS>
the
reference
to
the
bridal

to
point

"
those
word
and
the
doubt
which
have
just
escape
me
as
to
the
sanity
of
the
writer
of
the
letter
,
act
together
on
my
mind
,
suggest
an
idea
,
which
I
be
literally
afraid
to
express
openly
,
or
even
to
encourage
secretly

<EOS>
I
begin
to
doubt
whether
my
own
faculty
be
not
in
danger
of
lose
their
balance

It
seem
almost
like
a
monomania

back
everything
strange
that
happen
,
everything
unexpected
that
be
say
,
always
to
the
same
hide
source
and
the
same
sinister
influence
.
<EOS>
I
resolve
,
this
time
,
in
defence
of
my
own
courage
and
my
own
sense
,
to
come
to
no
decision
that
plain
fact
do
not
warrant
,
and
to
turn
my
back
resolutely
on
everything
that
tempt
me
in
the
shape

surmise
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
we
have
any
chance
of
trace
the
person
who
have
write
this
,
"
I
say
,
return
the
letter
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
there
can
be
no
harm
in
seize
our
opportunity
the
moment
it
offer
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
ought
to
speak
to
the
gardener
again
about
the
elderly
woman
who
give
him
the
letter
,
and
then
to
continue
our
inquiry
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
but
first
let
me
ask
a
question
.
<EOS>
You
mention
just
now
the
alternative
of
consult
Mr.
Fairlie
's
legal
adviser
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
be
there
no
possibility
of
communicate
with
him
earlier
?
<EOS>
why
not
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
explain
,
"
reply
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
by
enter
into
certain
particular
,
connect
with
my
sister
's
marriage
-
engagement
,
which
I
do
not
think
it
necessary
or
desirable
to
mention
to
you
this
morning
.
<EOS>
one
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
object
in
come
here
on
Monday
,
be
to
fix
the
period
of
his
marriage
,
which
have
hitherto
be
leave
quite
unsettled
.
<EOS>
He
be
anxious
that
the
event
should
take
place
before
the
end
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Miss
Fairlie
know
of
that
wish
?
"
I
ask
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
no
suspicion
of
it
,
and
after
what
have
happen
,
I
shall
not
take
the
responsibility
upon
myself
of
enlighten
her
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
only
mention
his
view
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
who
have
tell
me
himself
that
he
be
ready
and
anxious
,
as
Laura
's
guardian
,
to
forward
them
.
<EOS>
He
have
write
to
London
,
to
the
family
solicitor
,
Mr.
Gilmore
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
happen
to
be
away
in
Glasgow
on
business
,
and
he
have
reply
by
propose
to
stop
at
Limmeridge
House
on
his
way
back
to
town
.
<EOS>
He
will
arrive
to
-
morrow
,
and
will
stay
with
us
a
few
day
,
so
as
to
allow
Sir
Percival
time
to
plead
his
own
cause
.
<EOS>
if
he
succeed
,
Mr.
Gilmore
will
then
return
to
London
,
take
with
him
his
instruction
for
my
sister
's
marriage
-
settlement
.
<EOS>
You
understand
now
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
why
I
speak
of
wait
to
take
legal
advice
until
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
be
the
old
and
try
friend
of
two
generation
of
fairlie
,
and
we
can
trust
him
,
as
we
could
trust
no
one
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
marriage
-
settlement
!
<EOS>
the
mere
hearing
of
those
two
word
sting
me
with
a
jealous
despair
that
be
poison
to
my
high
and
well
instinct
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
 
it
be
hard
to
confess
this
,
but
I
must
suppress
nothing
from
begin
to
end
of
the
terrible
story
that
I
now
stand
committed
to
reveal
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
,
with
a
hateful
eagerness
of
hope
,
of
the
vague
charge
against
Sir
Percival
Glyde
which
the
anonymous
letter
contain
.
<EOS>
what
if
those
wild
accusation
rest
on
a
foundation
of
truth
?
<EOS>
what
if
their
truth
could
be
prove
before
the
fatal
word
of
consent
be
speak
,
and
the
marriage
-
settlement
be
draw
?
<EOS>
I
have
try
to
think
since
,
that
the
feeling
which
then
animate
me
begin
and
end
in
pure
devotion
to
Miss
Fairlie
's
interest
,
but
I
have
never
succeed
in
deceive
myself
into
believe
it
,
and
I
must
not
now
attempt
to
deceive
other
.
<EOS>
the
feeling
begin
and
end
in
reckless
,
vindictive
,
hopeless
hatred
of
the
man
who
be
to
marry
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
we
be
to
find
out
anything
,
"
I
say
,
<EOS>
speak
under
the
new
influence
which
be
now
direct
me
,
"
we
have
well
not
let
another
minute
slip
by
us
unemployed
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
suggest
,
once
more
,
the
propriety
of
question
the
gardener
a
second
time
,
and
of
inquire
in
the
village
immediately
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
may
be
of
help
to
you

<EOS>
I
have
the
door
in
my
hand
to
open
it
for
her
 
<EOS>

I
stop
,
on
a
sudden
,
to
ask
an
important
question
before

set
forth
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
of
the
paragraph
of
the
anonymous
letter
,

I
say
,

contain
some
sentence
of
minute
personal
description

Sir

I
know

do
that
description
at
all

accurately

his
age

<EOS>
I
know
that
 
and
yet
even
the
mention
of
his
age
<EOS>
,
when
I
contrast
it
with
her

add
to
my
blind
hatred

distrust
of
him

<EOS>
"
accurately
,
"
Miss
Halcombe
continue
,
"
even
to
the
scar
on
his
right
hand
,
which
be
the
scar
of
a
wound
that
he
receive
year
since
when
he
be
travel
in
Italy
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
every
peculiarity
of
his
personal
appearance
be
thoroughly
well
known
to
the
writer
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>

a
cough
that
he
be
troubled
with

I
remember
right

yes

treat
it
lightly

it

anxious

I
suppose
no

<EOS>
Mr.

be
not
unjust

let
that
infamous
letter

blood

into

for
I
know
that
it
have
influence
me

<EOS>

I
hope
not

I
answer
confusedly

perhaps
I
have
no
right

the
question

He
have
fight
successfully

and
have
come
out
of
the
ordeal
unscathed
.
<EOS>
a
man
who
can
do
that

in
England
,
be
a
man
whose
character
be
establish

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
open
the
door
for
her
in
silence
,
and
follow
her
out
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
convince
me
.
<EOS>
if
the
record
angel
have
come
down
from
heaven
to
confirm
her
,
and
have
open
his
book
to
my
mortal
eye
,
the
record
angel
would
not
have
convince
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
find
the
gardener
at
work
as
usual
.
<EOS>
no
amount
of
question
could
extract
a
single
answer
of
any
importance
from
the
lad
's
impenetrable
stupidity
.
<EOS>
the
woman
who
have
give
him
the
letter
be
an
elderly
woman
;
she
have
not
speak
a
word
to
him
,
and
she
have
go
away
towards
the
south
in
a
great
hurry
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
the
gardener
could
tell
us
.
  
<EOS>
the
village
lie
southward
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
so
to
the
village
we
go
next
.
    
<EOS>
Our
inquiry
at
Limmeridge
be
patiently
pursue
in
all
direction
,
and
among
all
sort
and
condition
of
people
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
come
of
them
.
<EOS>
three
of
the
villager
do
certainly
assure
us
that
they
have
see
the
woman
,
but
as
they
be
quite
unable
to
describe
her
,
and
quite
incapable
of
agree
about
the
exact
direction
in
which
she
be
proceed
when
they
last
see
her
,
these
three
bright
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
total
ignorance
afford
no
more
real
assistance
to
us
than
the
mass
of
their
unhelpful
and
unobservant
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
the
course
of
our
useless
investigation
bring
us
,
in
time
,
to
the
end
of
the
village
at
which
the
school
establish
by
Mrs.
Fairlie
be
situate
.
<EOS>
as
we
pass
the
side
of
the
building
appropriate
to
the
use
of
the
boy
,
I
suggest
the
propriety
of
make
a
last
inquiry
of
the
schoolmaster
,
whom
we
may
presume
to
be
,
in
virtue
of
his
office
,
the
most
intelligent
man
in
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
the
schoolmaster
must
have
be
occupy
with
his
scholar
,
"
say
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
just
at
the
time
when
the
woman
pass
through
the
village
and
return
again
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
can
but
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
enter
the
playground
enclosure
,
and
walk
by
the
schoolroom
window
to
get
round
to
the
door
,
which
be
situate
at
the
back
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
I
stop
for
a
moment
at
the
window
and
look
in
.
  
<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
be
sit
at
his
high
desk
,
with
his
back
to
me
,
apparently
harangue
the
pupil
,
who
be
all
gather
together
in
front
of
him
,
with
one
exception
.
<EOS>
the
one
exception
be
a
sturdy
white
-
head
boy
,
stand
apart
from
all
the
rest
on
a
stool
in
a
corner
 
<EOS>
a
forlorn
little
Crusoe
,
isolate
in
his
own
desert
island
of
solitary
penal
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
,
when
we
get
round
to
it
,
be
ajar
,
and
the
school
-
master
's
voice
reach
us
plainly
,
as
we
both
stop
for
a
minute
under
the
porch
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
boy
,
"
say
the
voice
,
"
mind
what
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
if
I
hear
another
word
speak
about
ghost
in
this
school
,
it
will
be
the
bad
for
all
of
you
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
such
thing
as
ghost
,
and
therefore
any
boy
who
believe
in
ghost
believe
in
what
can
not
possibly
be
;
and
a
boy
who
belong
to
Limmeridge
School
,
and
believe
in
what
can
not
possibly
be
,
set
up
his
back
against
reason
and
discipline
,
and
must
be
punish
accordingly
.
<EOS>
You
all
see
Jacob
Postlethwaite
stand
up
on
the
stool
there
in
disgrace
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
punish
,
not
because
he
say
he
see
a
ghost
last
night
,
but
because
he
be
too
impudent
and
too
obstinate
to
listen
to
reason
,
and
because
he
persist
in
say
he
see
the
ghost
after
I
have
tell
him
that
no
such
thing
can
possibly
be
.
<EOS>
if
nothing
else
will
do
,
I
mean
to
cane
the
ghost
out
of
Jacob
Postlethwaite
,
and
if
the
thing
spread
among
any
of
the
rest
of
you
,
I
mean
to
go
a
step
farther
,
and
cane
the
ghost
out
of
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
seem
to
have
choose
an
awkward
moment
for
our
visit
,
"
say
Miss
Halcombe
,
push
open
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
schoolmaster
's
address
,
and
lead
the
way
in
.
  
<EOS>
Our
appearance
produce
a
strong
sensation
among
the
boy
.
<EOS>
They
appear
to
think
that
we
have
arrive
for
the
express
purpose
of
see
Jacob
Postlethwaite
cane
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
home
all
of
you
to
dinner
,
"
say
the
schoolmaster
,
"
except
Jacob
.
<EOS>
Jacob
must
stop
where
he
be
;
and
the
ghost
may
bring
him
his
dinner
,
if
the
ghost
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jacob
's
fortitude
desert
him
at
the
double
disappearance
of
his
schoolfellow
and
his
prospect
of
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
take
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
,
look
hard
at
his
knuckle
,
raise
them
with
great
deliberation
to
his
eye
,
and
when
they
get
there
,
ground
them
round
and
round
slowly
,
accompany
the
action
by
short
spasm
of
sniffing
,
which
follow
each
other
at
regular
interval
 
the
nasal
minute
gun
of
juvenile
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
come
here
to
ask
you
a
question
,
Mr.
Dempster
,
"
say
Miss
Halcombe
,
address
the
schoolmaster
;
"
and
we
little
expect
to
find
you
occupy
in
exorcise
a
ghost

<EOS>
what
do
it
all
mean
?
<EOS>
what
have
really
happen
?

<EOS>
"
that
wicked
boy

Halcombe

by
declare
that
he
see
a
ghost
yesterday
evening

answer
the
master
;

and
he
still
persist
in
his
absurd
story
,
in
spite
of
all
that
I
can
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
most
extraordinary
,
"
say
Miss
Halcombe
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
think
it
possible
that
any
of
the
boy
have
imagination
enough
to
see
a
ghost

<EOS>
this
be
a
new
accession
indeed
to
the
hard
labour
of
form
the
youthful
mind
at
Limmeridge
,
and
I
heartily
wish
you
well
through
it
,
Mr.
Dempster

<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
let
me
explain
why
you
see
me
here
,
and
what
it
be
I
want
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
put
the
same
question
to
the
schoolmaster
which
we
have
ask
already
of
almost
every
one
else
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
It
be
meet
by
the
same
discouraging
answer
Mr.
Dempster
have
not
set
eye
on
the
stranger
of
whom
we
be
in
search
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
may
as
well
return
to
the
house
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
say
Miss
Halcombe
;
"
the
information
we
want
be
evidently
not
to
be
find
.

"
  
<EOS>
She
have
bow
to
Mr.
Dempster
,
and
be
about
to
leave
the
schoolroom
,
when
the
forlorn
position
of
Jacob
Postlethwaite
,
piteously
sniff
on
the
stool
of
penitence
,
attract
her
attention
as
she
pass
him
,
and
make
her
stop
good
-
humouredly
to
speak
a
word
to
the
little
prisoner
before
she
open
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
foolish
boy

she
say
,
"
why
do
not
you
beg
Mr.
Dempster

pardon
,

hold
your
tongue
about
the
ghost

I
beg
your
pardon

Miss

the
schoolmaster
a
little
uneasily

I

the
obstinate
folly

<EOS>
She
turn
with
an
air
of
satirical
defiance
to
little
Jacob
,
and
begin
to
question
him
directly
.
"

<EOS>
she

I

away

you
talk

manner

have
be
familiar

<EOS>
You
have
get
your

at

I
suppose
I
shall
hear
next
that
you
can
actually
tell
me
whose

it
be

"
<EOS>
eh
!
<EOS>
but
I
just
can

"
reply
Jacob
,
nod
his
head
with
an
air
of
gloomy
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dempster
have
already
try
several
time
to
speak
while
Miss
Halcombe
be
examine
his
pupil
,
and
he
now
interpose
resolutely
enough
to
make
himself
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
Miss

"
he
say
,

if
I
venture
to
say

him
these
question

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
merely
ask
one
more
,
Mr.
Dempster
,
and
then
I
shall
be
quite
satisfied
.
<EOS>
well
,
"
she
continue
,
turn
to
the
boy
,
"
and
whose
ghost
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
T
'
ghaist
of
Mistress
Fairlie
,
"
answer
Jacob
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
the
effect
which
this
extraordinary
reply
produce
on
Miss
Halcombe
fully
justify
the
anxiety
which
the
schoolmaster
have
show
to
prevent
her
from
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Her
face
crimson
with
indignation
 
<EOS>
she
turn
upon
little
Jacob
with
an
angry
suddenness
which
terrify
him
into
a
fresh
burst
of
tear
 
<EOS>
open
her
lip
to
speak
to
him
 
then
control
herself
,
and
address
the
master
instead
of
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
useless
,
"
she
say
,
"
to
hold
such
a
child
as
that
responsible
for
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
I
have
little
doubt
that
the
idea
have
be
put
into
his
head
by
other
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
people
in
this
village
,
Mr.
Dempster
,
who
have
forget
the
respect
and
gratitude
due
from
every
soul
in
it
to
my
mother
's
memory
,
I
will
find
them
out
,
and
if
I
have
any
influence
with
Mr.
Fairlie
,
they
shall
suffer
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
 
indeed
,
I
be
sure
,
Miss
Halcombe
 
<EOS>
that
you
be
mistaken
,
"
say
the
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
the
matter
begin
and
end
with
the
boy
's
own
perversity
and
folly
.
<EOS>
He
see
,
or
think
he
see
,
a
woman
in
white
,
yesterday
evening
,
as
he
be
pass
the
churchyard
;
and
the
figure
,
real
or
fancied
,
be
stand
by
the
marble
cross
,
which
he
and
every
one
else
in
Limmeridge
know
to
be
the
monument
over
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
.
<EOS>
these
two
circumstance
be
surely
sufficient
to
have
suggest
to
the
boy
himself
the
answer
which
have
so
naturally
shock
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
although
Miss
Halcombe
do
not
seem
to
be
convince
,
she
evidently
feel
that
the
schoolmaster
's
statement
of
the
case
be
too
sensible
to
be
openly
combat
.
<EOS>
She
merely
reply
by
thank
him
for
his
attention
,
and
by
promise
to
see
him
again
when
her
doubt
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
this
say
,
she
bow
,
and
lead
the
way
out
of
the
schoolroom
.
  
<EOS>
throughout
the
whole
of
this
strange
scene
I
have
stand
apart
,
listen
attentively
,
and
draw
my
own
conclusion
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
be
alone
again
,
Miss
Halcombe
ask
me
if
I
have
form
any
opinion
on
what
I
have
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
strong
opinion
,
"
I
answer
;
"
the
boy
's
story
,
as
I
believe
,
have
a
foundation
in
fact
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
be
anxious
to
see
the
monument
over
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
,
and
to
examine
the
ground
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
see
the
grave
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
after
make
that
reply
,
and
reflect
a
little
as
we
walk
on
.
<EOS>
"
what
have
happen
in
the
schoolroom
,
"
she
resume
,
"
have
so
completely
distract
my
attention
from
the
subject
of
the
letter
,
that
I
feel
a
little
bewildered
when
I
try
to
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
Must
we
give
up
all
idea
of
make
any
further
inquiry
,
and
wait
to
place
the
thing
in
Mr.
Gilmore
's
hand
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
by
no
mean
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
what
have
happen
in
the
schoolroom
encourage
me
to
persevere
in
the
investigation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
it
encourage
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
it
strengthen
a
suspicion
I
feel
when
you
give
me
the
letter
to
read
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
your
reason
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
for
conceal
that
suspicion
from
me
till
this
moment
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
to
encourage
it
in
myself
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
utterly
preposterous
 
<EOS>
I
distrust
it
as
the
result
of
some
perversity
in
my
own
imagination
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
do
so
no
longer
.
<EOS>
not
only
the
boy
's
own
answer
to
your
question
,
but
even
a
chance
expression
that
drop
from
the
schoolmaster
's
lip
in
explain
his
story
,
have
force
the
idea
back
into
my
mind
.
<EOS>
event
may
yet
prove
that
idea
to
be
a
delusion
,
Miss
Halcombe
;
but
the
belief
be
strong
in
me
,
at
this
moment
,
that
the
fancy
ghost
in
the
churchyard
,
and
the
writer
of
the
anonymous
letter
,
be
one
and
the
same
person
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
stop
,
turn
pale
,
and
look
me
eagerly
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
person
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
schoolmaster
unconsciously
tell
you
.
<EOS>
when
he
speak
of
the
figure
that
the
boy
see
in
the
churchyard
he
call
it
"
a
woman
in
white
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
Anne
Catherick
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
through
my
arm
and
lean
on
it
heavily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
,
"
she
say
in
low
tone
,
"
but
there
be
something
in
this
suspicion
of
yours
that
seem
to
startle
and
unnerve
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
 
"
She
stop
,
and
try
to
laugh
it
off
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
she
go
on
,
"
I
will
show
you
the
grave
,
and
then
go
back
at
once
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
have
well
not
leave
Laura
too
long
alone
.
<EOS>
I
have
better
go
back
and
sit
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
be
close
to
the
churchyard
when
she
speak
.
<EOS>
the
church
,
a
dreary
building
of
grey
stone
,
be
situate
in
a
little
valley
,
so
as
to
be
shelter
from
the
bleak
wind
blow
over
the
moorland
all
round
it
.
<EOS>
the
burial
-
ground
advanced
,
from
the
side
of
the
church
,
a
little
way
up
the
slope
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
It
be
surround
by
a
rough
,
low
stone
wall
,
and
be
bare
and
open
to
the
sky
,
except
at
one
extremity
,
where
a
brook
trickle
down
the
stony
hill
-
side
,
and
a
clump
of
dwarf
tree
throw
their
narrow
shadow
over
the
short
,
meagre
grass
.
<EOS>
just
beyond
the
brook
and
the
tree
,
and
not
far
from
one
of
the
three
stone
stile
which
afford
entrance
,
at
various
point
,
to
the
churchyard
,
rise
the
white
marble
cross
that
distinguish
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
from
the
humbler
monument
scatter
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
go
no
farther
with
you
,
"
say
Miss
Halcombe
,
point
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
let
me
know
if
you
find
anything
to
confirm
the
idea
you
have
just
mention
to
me
.
<EOS>
let
us
meet
again
at
the
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
leave
me
.
<EOS>
I
descend
at
once
to
the
churchyard
,
and
cross
the
stile
which
lead
directly
to
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
.
  
<EOS>
the
grass
about
it
be
too
short
,
and
the
ground
too
hard
,
to
show
any
mark
of
footstep
.
<EOS>
disappoint
thus
far
,
I
next
look
attentively
at
the
cross
,
and
at
the
square
block
of
marble
below
it
,
on
which
the
inscription
be
cut
.
  
<EOS>
the
natural
whiteness
of
the
cross
be
a
little
clouded
,
here
and
there
,
by
weather
stain
,
and
rather
more
than
one
half
of
the
square
block
beneath
it
,
on
the
side
which
bear
the
inscription
,
be
in
the
same
condition
.
<EOS>
the
other
half
,
however
,
attract
my
attention
at
once
by
its
singular
freedom
from
stain
or
impurity
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
I
look
closer
,
and
see
that
it
have
be
clean
 
recently
clean
,
in
a
downward
direction
from
top
to
bottom
.
<EOS>
the
boundary
line
between
the
part
that
have
be
clean
and
the
part
that
have
not
be
traceable
wherever
the
inscription
leave
a
blank
space
of
marble
 
sharply
traceable
as
a
line
that
have
be
produce
by
artificial
mean
.
<EOS>
who
have
begin
the
cleansing
of
the
marble
,
and
who
have
leave
it
unfinished
?
  
<EOS>
I
look
about
me
,
wonder
how
the
question
be
to
be
solve
.
<EOS>
no
sign
of
a
habitation
could
be
discern
from
the
point
at
which
I
be
stand
 
the
burial
-
ground
be
leave
in
the
lonely
possession
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
I
return
to
the
church
,
and
walk
round
it
till
I
come
to
the
back
of
the
building
;
then
cross
the
boundary
wall
beyond
,
by
another
of
the
stone
stile
,
and
find
myself
at
the
head
of
a
path
lead
down
into
a
desert
stone
quarry
.
<EOS>
against
one
side
of
the
quarry
a
little
two
-
room
cottage
be
build
,
and
just
outside
the
door
an
old
woman
be
engage
in
washing
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
up
to
her
,
and
enter
into
conversation
about
the
church
and
burial
-
ground
.
<EOS>
She
be
ready
enough
to
talk
,
and
almost
the
first
word
she
say
inform
me
that
her
husband
fill
the
two
office
of
clerk
and
sexton
.
<EOS>
I
say
a
few
word
next
in
praise
of
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
monument
.
<EOS>
the
old
woman
shake
her
head
,
and
tell
me
I
have
not
see
it
at
its
good
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
husband
's
business
to
look
after
it
,
but
he
have
be
so
ailing
and
weak
for
month
and
month
past
,
that
he
have
hardly
be
able
to
crawl
into
church
on
Sundays
to
do
his
duty
,
and
the
monument
have
be
neglect
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
He
be
get
a
little
better
now
,
and
in
a
week
or
ten
day
'
time
he
hope
to
be
strong
enough
to
set
to
work
and
clean
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
information
 
extract
from
a
long
rambling
answer
in
the
broad
Cumberland
<EOS>
dialect
 
tell
me
all
that
I
most
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
I
give
the
poor
woman
a
trifle
,
and
return
at
once
to
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
the
partial
cleansing
of
the
monument
have
evidently
be
accomplish
by
a
strange
hand
.
<EOS>
connect
what
I
have
discover
,
thus
far
,
with
what
I
have
suspect
after
hear
the
story
of
the
ghost
see
at
twilight
,
I
want
nothing
more
to
confirm
my
resolution
to
watch
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
,
in
secret
,
that
evening
,
return
to
it
at
sunset
,
and
wait
within
sight
of
it
till
the
night
fall
.
<EOS>
the
work
of
cleanse
the
monument
have
be
leave
unfinished
,
and
the
person
by
whom
it
have
be
begin
may
return
to
complete
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
get
back
to
the
house
I
inform
Miss
Halcombe
of
what
I
intend
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
look
surprised
and
uneasy
while
I
be
explain
my
purpose
,
but
she
make
no
positive
objection
to
the
execution
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
only
say
,
"
I
hope
it
may
end
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
just
as
she
be
leave
me
again
,
I
stop
her
to
inquire
,
as
calmly
as
I
could
,
after
Miss
Fairlie
's
health
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
well
spirit
,
and
Miss
Halcombe
hope
she
may
be
induce
to
take
a
little
walking
exercise
while
the
afternoon
sun
last
.
  
<EOS>
I
return
to
my
own
room
to
resume
set
the
drawing
in
order
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
do
this
,
and
doubly
necessary
to
keep
my
mind
employ
on
anything
that
would
help
to
distract
my
attention
from
myself
,
and
from
the
hopeless
future
that
lie
before
me
.
<EOS>
from
time
to
time
I
pause
in
my
work
to
look
out
of
window
and
watch
the
sky
as
the
sun
sink
nearer
and
near
to
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
on
one
of
those
occasion
I
see
a
figure
on
the
broad
gravel
walk
under
my
window
.
<EOS>
It
be
Miss
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
her
since
the
morning
,
and
I
have
hardly
speak
to
her
then
.
<EOS>
another
day
at
Limmeridge
be
all
that
remain
to
me
,
and
after
that
day
my
eye
may
never
look
on
her
again
.
<EOS>
this
thought
be
enough
to
hold
me
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
have
sufficient
consideration
for
her
to
arrange
the
blind
so
that
she
may
not
see
me
if
she
look
up
,
but
I
have
no
strength
to
resist
the
temptation
of
let
my
eye
,
at
least
,
follow
her
as
far
as
they
could
on
her
walk
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
dress
in
a
brown
cloak
,
with
a
plain
black
silk
gown
under
it
.
<EOS>
on
her
head
be
the
same
simple
straw
hat
which
she
have
wear
on
the
morning
when
we
first
meet
.
<EOS>
a
veil
be
attach
to
it
now
which
hide
her
face
from
me
.
<EOS>
by
her
side
trot
a
little
italian
greyhound
,
the
pet
companion
of
all
her
walk
,
smartly
dress
in
a
scarlet
cloth
wrapper
,
to
keep
the
sharp
air
from
his
delicate
skin
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
seem
to
notice
the
dog
.
<EOS>
She
walk
straight
forward
,
with
her
head
droop
a
little
,
and
her
arm
fold
in
her
cloak
.
<EOS>
the
dead
leave
,
which
have
whirl
in
the
wind
before
me
when
I
have
hear
of
her
marriage
engagement
in
the
morning
,
whirl
in
the
wind
before
her
,
and
rise
and
fall
and
scatter
themselves
at
her
foot
as
she
walk
on
in
the
pale
waning
sunlight
.
<EOS>
the
dog
shiver
and
tremble
,
and
press
against
her
dress
impatiently
for
notice
and
encouragement
.
<EOS>
but
she
never
heed
him
.
<EOS>
She
walk
on
,
farther
and
farther
away
from
me
,
with
the
dead
leave
whirl
about
her
on
the
path
 
walk
on
,
till
my
ache
eye
could
see
her
no
more
,
and
I
be
leave
alone
again
with
my
own
heavy
heart
.
  
<EOS>
in
another
hour
's
time
I
have
do
my
work
,
and
the
sunset
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
I
get
my
hat
and
coat
in
the
hall
,
and
slip
out
of
the
house
without
meet
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
the
cloud
be
wild
in
the
western
heaven
,
and
the
wind
blow
chill
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
far
as
the
shore
be
,
the
sound
of
the
surf
sweep
over
the
intervene
moorland
,
and
beat
drearily
in
my
ear
when
I
enter
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
not
a
live
creature
be
in
sight
.
<EOS>
the
place
look
lonely
than
ever
as
I
choose
my
position
,
and
wait
and
watch
,
with
my
eye
on
the
white
cross
that
rise
over
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
.
    
<EOS>
the
expose
situation
of
the
churchyard
have
oblige
me
to
be
cautious
in
choose
the
position
that
I
be
to
occupy
.
  
<EOS>
the
main
entrance
to
the
church
be
on
the
side
next
to
the
burial
-
ground
,
and
the
door
be
screen
by
a
porch
wall
in
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
after
some
little
hesitation
,
cause
by
natural
reluctance
to
conceal
myself
,
indispensable
as
that
concealment
be
to
the
object
in
view
,
I
have
resolve
on
enter
the
porch
.
<EOS>
a
loophole
window
be
pierce
in
each
of
its
side
wall
.
<EOS>
through
one
of
these
window
I
could
see
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
.
<EOS>
the
other
look
towards
the
stone
quarry
in
which
the
sexton
's
cottage
be
build
.
<EOS>
before
me
,
front
the
porch
entrance
,
be
a
patch
of
bare
burial
-
ground
,
a
line
of
low
stone
wall
,
and
a
strip
of
lonely
brown
hill
,
with
the
sunset
cloud
sail
heavily
over
it
before
the
strong
,
steady
wind
.
<EOS>
no
live
creature
be
visible
or
audible
 
<EOS>
no
bird
fly
by
me
,
no
dog
bark
from
the
sexton
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
the
pause
in
the
dull
beating
of
the
surf
be
fill
up
by
the
dreary
rustling
of
the
dwarf
tree
near
the
grave
,
and
the
cold
faint
bubble
of
the
brook
over
its
stony
bed
.
<EOS>
a
dreary
scene
and
a
dreary
hour
.
<EOS>
My
spirit
sink
fast
as
I
count
out
the
minute
of
the
evening
in
my
hiding
-
place
under
the
church
porch
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
twilight
yet
 
the
light
of
the
set
sun
still
linger
in
the
heavens
,
and
little
more
than
the
first
half
-
hour
of
my
solitary
watch
have
elapse
 
when
I
hear
footstep
and
a
voice
.
<EOS>
the
footstep
be
approach
from
the
other
side
of
the
church
,
and
the
voice
be
a
woman
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
fret
,
my
dear
,
about
the
letter
,
"
say
the
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
it
to
the
lad
quite
safe
,
and
the
lad
he
take
it
from
me
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
go
his
way
<EOS>
and
I
go
mine
,
and
not
a
live
soul
follow
me
afterwards
 
that
I
will
warrant
.
"
  
<EOS>
these
word
string
up
my
attention
to
a
pitch
of
expectation
that
be
almost
painful
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
of
silence
,
but
the
footstep
still
advance
.
<EOS>
in
another
moment
two
person
,
both
woman
,
pass
within
my
range
of
view
from
the
porch
window
.
<EOS>
They
be
walk
straight
towards
the
grave
;
and
therefore
they
have
their
back
turn
towards
me
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
woman
be
dress
in
a
bonnet
and
shawl
.
<EOS>
the
other
wear
a
long
travelling
-
cloak
of
a
dark
-
blue
colour
,
with
the
hood
draw
over
her
head
.
<EOS>
a
few
inch
of
her
gown
be
visible
below
the
cloak
.
<EOS>
My
heart
beat
fast
as
I
note
the
colour
 
<EOS>
it
be
white
.
  
<EOS>
after
advance
about
half
-
way
between
the
church
and
the
grave
they
stop
,
and
the
woman
in
the
cloak
turn
her
head
towards
her
companion
.
<EOS>
but
her
side
face
,
which
a
bonnet
may
now
have
allow
me
to
see
,
be
hide
by
the
heavy
,
project
edge
of
the
hood
.
  
<EOS>
"
mind
you
keep
that
comfortable
warm
cloak
on
,
"
say
the
same
voice
which
I
have
already
hear
 
the
voice
of
the
woman
in
the
shawl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Todd
be
right
about
your
look
too
particular
,
yesterday
,
all
in
white
.
<EOS>
I
will
walk
about
a
little
while
you
be
here
,
churchyard
be
not
at
all
in
my
way
,
whatever
they
may
be
in
yours
.
<EOS>
finish
what
you
want
to
do
before
I
come
back
,
and
let
us
be
sure
and
get
home
again
before
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
with
those
word
she
turn
about
,
and
retrace
her
step
,
advanced
with
her
face
towards
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
face
of
an
elderly
woman
,
brown
,
rugged
,
and
healthy
,
with
nothing
dishonest
or
suspicious
in
the
look
of
it
.
<EOS>
close
to
the
church
she
stop
to
pull
her
shawl
closer
round
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Queer
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
"
always
queer
,
with
her
whim
and
her
way
,
ever
since
I
can
remember
her
.
<EOS>
harmless
,
though
 
as
harmless
,
poor
soul
,
as
a
little
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sigh
 
look
about
the
burial
-
ground
<EOS>
nervously
 
shake
her
head
,
as
if
the
dreary
prospect
by
no
mean
please
her
,
and
disappear
round
the
corner
of
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
I
doubt
for
a
moment
whether
I
ought
to
follow
and
speak
to
her
or
not
.
<EOS>
My
intense
anxiety
to
find
myself
face
to
face
with
her
companion
help
me
to
decide
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
I
could
ensure
see
the
woman
in
the
shawl
by
wait
near
the
churchyard
until
she
come
back
 
although
it
seem
more
than
doubtful
whether
she
could
give
me
the
information
of
which
I
be
in
search
.
<EOS>
the
person
who
have
deliver
the
letter
be
of
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
the
person
who
have
write
it
be
the
one
centre
of
interest
,
and
the
one
source
of
information
,
and
that
person
I
now
feel
convinced
be
before
me
in
the
churchyard
.
  
<EOS>
while
these
idea
be
pass
through
my
mind
<EOS>
I
see
the
woman
in
the
cloak
approach
close
to
the
grave
,
and
stand
look
at
it
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
She
then
glance
all
round
her
,
and
take
a
white
linen
cloth
or
handkerchief
from
under
her
cloak
,
turn
aside
towards
the
brook
.
<EOS>
the
little
stream
run
into
the
churchyard
under
a
tiny
archway
in
the
bottom
of
the
wall
,
and
run
out
again
,
after
a
winding
course
of
a
few
dozen
yard
,
under
a
similar
opening
.
<EOS>
She
dip
the
cloth
in
the
water
,
and
return
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
kiss
the
white
cross
,
then
kneel
down
before
the
inscription
,
and
apply
her
wet
cloth
to
the
cleansing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
after
consider
how
I
could
show
myself
with
the
least
possible
chance
of
frighten
her
,
I
resolve
to
cross
the
wall
before
me
,
to
skirt
round
it
outside
,
and
to
enter
the
churchyard
again
by
the
stile
near
the
grave
,
in
order
that
she
may
see
me
as
I
approach
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
absorb
over
her
employment
that
she
do
not
hear
me
come
until
I
have
step
over
the
stile
.
<EOS>
then
she
look
up
,
start
to
her
foot
with
a
faint
cry
,
and
stand
face
me
in
speechless
and
motionless
terror
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
frightened
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
surely
you
remember
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
stop
while
I
speak
 
then
advance
a
few
step
gently
 
then
stop
again
 
and
so
approach
by
little
and
little
till
I
be
close
to
her
.
<EOS>
if
there
have
be
any
doubt
still
leave
in
my
mind
,
it
must
have
be
now
set
at
rest
.
<EOS>
there
,
speak
affrightedly
for
itself
 
there
be
the
same
face
confront
me
over
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
which
have
first
look
into
mine
on
the
high
-
road
by
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
We
meet
very
late
,
and
I
help
you
to
find
the
way
to
London
.
<EOS>
surely
you
have
not
forget
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
feature
relaxed
,
and
she
draw
a
heavy
breath
of
relief
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
new
life
of
recognition
stir
slowly
under
the
death
-
like
stillness
which
fear
have
set
on
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
attempt
to
speak
to
me
just
yet
,
"
I
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
take
time
to
recover
yourself
 
take
time
to
feel
quite
certain
that
I
be
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
kind
to
me
,
"
she
murmur
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
kind
now
as
you
be
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
stop
,
and
I
keep
silence
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
grant
time
for
composure
to
her
only
,
I
be
gain
time
also
for
myself
.
<EOS>
under
the
wan
wild
evening
light
,
that
woman
and
I
be
meet
together
again
,
a
grave
between
us
,
the
dead
about
us
,
the
lonesome
hill
close
us
round
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
the
time
,
the
place
,
the
circumstance
under
which
we
now
stand
face
to
face
in
the
evening
stillness
of
that
dreary
valley
 
the
lifelong
interest
which
may
hang
suspend
on
the
next
chance
word
that
pass
between
us
 
the
sense
that
,
for
aught
I
know
to
the
contrary
,
the
whole
future
of
Laura
Fairlie
's
life
may
be
determine
,
for
good
or
for
evil
,
by
my
win
or
lose
the
confidence
of
the
forlorn
creature
who
stand
tremble
by
her
mother
's
grave
 
all
<EOS>
threaten
to
shake
the
steadiness
and
the
self
-
control
on
which
every
inch
of
the
progress
I
may
yet
make
now
depend
.
<EOS>
I
try
hard
,
as
I
feel
this
,
to
possess
myself
of
all
my
resource
;
I
do
my
utmost
to
turn
the
few
moment
for
reflection
to
the
good
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
calm
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
as
soon
as
I
think
it
time
to
speak
again
.
"
<EOS>
Can
you
talk
to
me
without
feel
frightened
,
and
without
forget
that
I
be
a
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
ask
,
without
notice
what
I
have
just
say
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
remember
my
tell
you
,
<EOS>
when
we
last
meet
,
that
I
be
go
to
Cumberland
?
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
Cumberland
ever
since
 
I
have
be
stay
all
the
time
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
at
Limmeridge
House
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
pale
face
brighten
as
she
repeat
the
word
,
her
wander
eye
fix
on
me
with
a
sudden
interest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
how
happy
you
must
have
be
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
look
at
me
eagerly
,
without
a
shadow
of
its
former
distrust
leave
in
her
expression
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
advantage
of
her
newly
-
arouse
confidence
in
me
to
observe
her
face
,
with
an
attention
and
a
curiosity
which
I
have
hitherto
restrain
myself
from
show
,
for
caution
's
sake
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
her
,
with
my
mind
full
of
that
other
lovely
face
which
have
so
ominously
recall
her
to
my
memory
on
the
terrace
by
moonlight
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
Anne
Catherick
's
likeness
in
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
I
now
see
Miss
Fairlie
's
likeness
in
Anne
Catherick
 
see
it
all
the
more
clearly
because
the
point
of
dissimilarity
between
the
two
be
present
to
me
as
well
as
the
point
of
resemblance
.
<EOS>
in
the
general
outline
of
the
countenance
and
general
proportion
of
the
feature
 
in
the
colour
of
the
hair
and
in
the
little
nervous
uncertainty
about
the
lip
 
in
the
height
and
size
of
the
figure
,
and
the
carriage
of
the
head
and
body
,
the
likeness
appear
even
more
startling
than
I
have
ever
feel
it
to
be
yet
.
<EOS>
but
there
the
resemblance
end
,
and
the
dissimilarity
,
in
detail
,
begin
.
<EOS>
the
delicate
beauty
of
Miss
Fairlie

the

clearness
of

the
smooth
purity
of

skin

the

colour

although
I
hate
myself
even
for
think
such
a
thing

still
,
while
I
look
at
the
woman
before

the
idea
would
force
itself
into
my

that
one
sad
change

in
the

be
all
that

to

if
ever
sorrow
and
suffering
set
their
profaning
mark
on
the
youth
and
beauty
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
face
,
then
,
and
then
only
,
Anne
Catherick
and
she
would
be
the
twin
-
sister
of
chance
resemblance
,
the
live
reflection
of
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
I
shudder
at
the
thought
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
horrible
in
the
blind
unreasoning
distrust
of
the
future
which
the
mere
passage
of
it
through
my
mind
seem
to
imply
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
welcome
interruption
to
be
rouse
by
feel
Anne
Catherick
's
hand
lay
on
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
the
touch
be
as
stealthy
and
as
sudden
as
that
other
touch
which
have
petrify
me
from
head
to
foot
on
the
night
when
we
first
meet
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

at

something

rapidity
of
utterance

I

<EOS>
She
turn
from

kneel
down

the

once
more

it

<EOS>
the
old
grateful
sense

her
benefactress

kindness

evidently
the
rule
idea
still
in
the
poor
creature

mind
 
<EOS>
the
narrow
mind
which
have
but
too
plainly
open
to
no
other
last
impression
since
that
first
impression
of
her
young
and
happy
day

<EOS>
I
see
that
my
good
chance
of
win
her
confidence
lie
in
encourage
her
to
proceed
with
the
artless
employment
which
she
have
come
into
the
burial

ground
to
pursue

<EOS>
She
resume
it
at
once
,
on
my
tell

may
do
so

touch
the
hard
marble
as
tenderly
as

it
have
be
a
sentient
thing

and
whisper
the
word
of
the
inscription
to
herself
,
over
and
over
again

as
if
the
lose
day
of
her

have
return

patiently
learn
her
lesson
once
more
at
Mrs.

<EOS>
"
Should

a

My
manner
seem
to
influence
her
more
than

<EOS>
She
make
an
effort
to
grasp
the
new
idea
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
shift
the
damp
cloth
hesitatingly
from
one

the
other

exactly

have
shift
the
little
travelling

bag
on

night

slowly
the

its

confusion

slowly
her
feature
relaxed

then
,
with
evident
suspicion

anxiously

cross
my

over
my
misfortune

it
must
be
keep
secret
from
everybody

"
  
<EOS>
Her
"
misfortune
.
<EOS>
"
in
what
sense
be
she
use
that
word
?
<EOS>
in
a
sense
which
may
explain
her
motive
in
write
the
anonymous
letter
?
<EOS>
in
a
sense
which
may
show
it
to
be
the
too
common
and
too
customary
motive
that
have
lead
many
a
woman
to
interpose
anonymous
hindrance
to
the
marriage
of
the
man
who
have
ruin
her
?
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
attempt
the
clearing
up
of
this
doubt
before
more
word
pass
between
us
on
either
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
misfortune
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
misfortune

my
being
shut
up

she
answer
,
with
every
appearance
of
feeling
surprised
at
my
question
.
<EOS>
"
what
other
misfortune
could
there
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
determine
to
persist
,
as
delicately
and
forbearingly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
very
great
importance
that
I
should
be
absolutely
sure
of
every
step
in
the
investigation
which
I
now
gain
in
advance
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
another
misfortune
,
"
I
say
,
"
to
which
a
woman
may
be
liable
,
and
by
which
she
may
suffer
lifelong
sorrow
and
shame

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
misfortune
of
believe
too
innocently
in
her
own
virtue
,

in
the
faith

honour
of
the
man
she
love
,

I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
She
look
up
at
me
with
the
artless
bewilderment
of
a
child
.
<EOS>
not
the
slight
confusion
or
change
of
colour
 
not
the
faint
trace
of
any
secret
consciousness
of
shame
struggle
to
the
surface
appear
in
her
face
 
that
face
which
betray
every
other
emotion
with
such
transparent
clearness
.
<EOS>
no
word
that
ever
be
speak
could
have
assure
me
,
as
her
look
and
manner
now
assure
me
,
that
the
motive
which
I
have
assign
for
her
write
the
letter
and
send
it
to
Miss
Fairlie
be
plainly
and
distinctly
the
wrong
one
.
<EOS>
that
doubt
,
at
any
rate
,
be
now
set
at
rest
;
but
the
very
removal
of
it
open
a
new
prospect
of
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
the
letter
,
as
I
know
from
positive
testimony
,
point
at
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
though
it
do
not
name
him
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
have
some
strong
motive
,
originate
in
some
deep
sense
of
injury
,
for
secretly
denounce
him
to
Miss
Fairlie
in
such
term
as
she
have
employ
,
and
that
motive
be
unquestionably
not
to
be
trace
to
the
loss
of
her
innocence
and
her
character
.
<EOS>
whatever
wrong
he
may
have
inflict
on
her
be
not
of
that
nature
.
<EOS>
of
what
nature
could
it
be
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
,
"
she
say
,
after
evidently
try
hard
,
and
try
in
vain
,
to
discover
the
meaning
of
the
word
I
have
last
say
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
never

I
answer

"
let
us
go
on

at
the
junction
of
two
hill
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
relation
of
Mrs.
Clements
at
Todd
's
Corner
,
"
she
go
on
,
"
and
they
have
often
ask
her
to
go
and
see
them
.
<EOS>
She
say
she
would
go
,
and
take
me
with
her
,
for
the
quiet
and
the
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
kind
,
be
it
not
?
<EOS>
I
would
have
go
anywhere
to
be
quiet
,
and
safe
,
and
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
hear
that
Todd
's
Corner
be
near
Limmeridge
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
be
so
happy
I
would
have
walk
all
the
way
barefoot
to
get
there
,
and
see
the
school
and
the
village
and
Limmeridge
House
again
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
good
people
at
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
stay
there
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
thing
I
do
not
like
about
them
,
and
do
not
like
about
Mrs.
Clements
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
tease
me
about
dress
all
in
white
 
<EOS>
they
say
it
look
so
particular
.
<EOS>
how
do
they
know
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairlie
know
best
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairlie
would
never
have
make
me
wear
this
ugly
blue
cloak
!
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
she
be
fond
of
white
in
her
lifetime
,
and
here
be
white
stone
about
her
grave
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
make
it
white
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
She
often
wear
white
herself
,
and
she
always
dress
her
little
daughter
in
white
.
<EOS>
be
Miss
Fairlie
well
and
happy
?
<EOS>
do
she
wear
white
now
,
as
she
use
when
she
be
a
girl
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
voice
sink
when
she
put
the
question
about
Miss
Fairlie
,
and
she
turn
her
head
farther
and
farther
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
detect
,
in
the
alteration
of
her
manner
,
an
uneasy
consciousness
of
the
risk
she
have
run
in
send
the
anonymous
letter
,
and
I
instantly
determine
so
to
frame
my
answer
as
to
surprise
her
into
own
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Fairlie
be
not
very
well
or
very
happy
this
morning
,
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
She
murmur
a
few
word
,
but
they
be
speak
so
confusedly
,
and
in
such
a
low
tone
,
that
I
could
not
even
guess
at
what
they
mean
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
ask
me
why
Miss
Fairlie
be
neither
well
nor
happy
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
I
continue
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
she
say
quickly
and
eagerly
 
"
<EOS>
oh
no
,
I
never
ask
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
without
your
asking
,
"
I
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
have
receive
your
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
be
down
on
her
knee
for
some
little
time
past
,
carefully
remove
the
last
weather
-
stain
leave
about
the
inscription
while
we
be
speak
together
.
<EOS>
the
first
sentence
of
the
word
I
have
just
address
to
her
make
her
pause
in
her
occupation
,
and
turn
slowly
without
rise
from
her
knee
,
so
as
to
face
me
.
<EOS>
the
second
sentence
literally
petrify
her
.
<EOS>
the
cloth
she
have
be
hold
drop
from
her
hand
 
her
lip
fall
apart
 
all
the
little
colour
that
there
be
naturally
in
her
face
leave
it
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who
show
it
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
blood
rush
back
into
her
face
 
rush
overwhelmingly
,
as
the
sense
rush
upon
her
mind
that
her
own
word
have
betray
her
.
<EOS>
She
strike
her
hand
together
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
write
it
,
"
she
gasp
affrightedly
;
"
I
know
nothing
about
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
,
"
you
write
it
,
and
you
know
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
wrong
to
send
such
a
letter
,
it
be
wrong
to
frighten
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
anything
to
say
that
it
be
right
and
necessary
for
her
to
hear
,
you
should
have
go
yourself
to
Limmeridge
House
 
<EOS>
you
should
have
speak
to
the
young
lady
with
your
own
lip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
crouch
down
over
the
flat
stone
of
the
grave
,
till
her
face
be
hide
on
it
,
and
make
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Fairlie
will
be
as
good
and
kind
to
you
as
her
mother
be
,
if
you
mean
well
,
"
I
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
will
keep
your
secret
,
and
not
let
you
come
to
any
harm
.
<EOS>
Will
you
see
her
to
-
morrow
at
the
farm
?
<EOS>
Will
you
meet
her
in
the
garden
at
Limmeridge
House
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
if
I
could
die
,
and
be
hide
and
at
rest
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
Her
lip
murmur
the
word
close
on
the
grave
-
stone
,
murmur
them
in
tone
of
passionate
endearment
,
to
the
dead
remain
beneath
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
I
love
your
child
,
for
your
sake
!
<EOS>
oh
,
Mrs.
Fairlie
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairlie
!
<EOS>
tell
me
how
to
save
her
.
<EOS>
be
my
darling
and
my
mother
once
more
,
and
tell
me
what
to
do
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hear
her
lip
kiss
the
stone
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
hand
beat
on
it
passionately
.
<EOS>
the
sound
and
the
sight
deeply
affect
me
.
<EOS>
I
stoop
down
,
and
take
the
poor
helpless
hand
tenderly
in
mine
,
and
try
to
soothe
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
useless
.
<EOS>
She
snatch
her
hand
from
me
,
and
never
move
her
face
from
the
stone
.
<EOS>
see
the
urgent
necessity
of
quiet
her
at
any
hazard
and
by
any
mean
,
I
appeal
to
the
only
anxiety
that
she
appear
to
feel
,
in
connection
with
me
and
with
my
opinion
of
her
 
the
anxiety
to
convince
me
of
her
fitness
to
be
mistress
of
her
own
action
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
"
I
say
gently
.
<EOS>
"
try
to
compose
yourself
,
or
you
will
make
me
alter
my
opinion
of
you
.
<EOS>
do
not
let
me
think
that
the
person
who
put
you
in
the
Asylum
may
have
have
some
excuse
 
"
  
the
next
word
die
away
on
my
lip
.
<EOS>
the
instant
I
risk
that
chance
reference
to
the
person
who
have
put
her
in
the
Asylum
<EOS>
she
spring
up
on
her
knee
.
<EOS>
a
most
extraordinary
and
startling
change
pass
over
her
.
<EOS>
Her
face
,
at
all
ordinary
time
so
touch
to
look
at
,
in
its
nervous
sensitiveness
,
weakness
,
and
uncertainty
,
become
suddenly
darken
by
an
expression
of
maniacally
intense
hatred
and
fear
,
which
communicate
a
wild
,
unnatural
force
to
every
feature
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
dilate
in
the
dim
evening
light
,
like
the
eye
of
a
wild
animal
.
<EOS>
She
catch
up
the
cloth
that
have
fall
at
her
side
,
as
if
it
have
be
a
live
creature
that
she
could
kill
,
and
crush
it
in
both
her
hand
with
such
convulsive
strength
,
that
the
few
drop
of
moisture
leave
in
it
trickle
down
on
the
stone
beneath
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
talk
of
something
else
,
"
she
say
,
whisper
through
her
tooth
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
lose
myself
if
you
talk
of
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
every
vestige
of
the
gentler
thought
which
have
fill
her
mind
hardly
a
minute
since
seem
to
be
sweep
from
it
now
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
the
impression
leave
by
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
kindness
be
not
,
as
I
have
suppose
,
the
only
strong
impression
on
her
memory
.
<EOS>
with
the
grateful
remembrance
of
her
school
-
day
at
Limmeridge
,
there
exist
the
vindictive
remembrance
of
the
wrong
inflict
on
her
by
her
confinement
in
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
who
have
do
that
wrong
?
<EOS>
Could
it
really
be
her
mother
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
hard
to
give
up
pursue
the
inquiry
to
that
final
point
,
but
I
force
myself
to
abandon
all
idea
of
continue
it
.
<EOS>
see
her
as
I
see
her
now
,
it
would
have
be
cruel
to
think
of
anything
but
the
necessity
and
the
humanity
of
restore
her
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
talk
of
nothing
to
distress
you
,
"
I
say
soothingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
something
,
"
she
answer
sharply
and
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
look
at
me
like
that
.
<EOS>
speak
to
me
 
tell
me
what
you
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
want
you
to
quiet
yourself
,
and
when
you
be
calm
,
to
think
over
what
I
have
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
say
?
"
<EOS>
She
pause
 
twist
the
cloth
in
her
hand
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
whisper
to
herself
,
"
what
be
it
<EOS>
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
She
turn
again
towards
me
,
and
shake
her
head
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
help
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
,
with
angry
suddenness
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
will
help
you
,
and
you
will
soon
remember
.
<EOS>
I
ask
you
to
see
Miss
Fairlie
to
-
morrow
and
to
tell
her
the
truth
about
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
 
<EOS>
Fairlie
 
Fairlie
 
<EOS>
"
  
the
mere
utterance
of
the
loved
familiar
name
seem
to
quiet
her
.
<EOS>
Her
face
soften
and
grow
like
itself
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
have
no
fear
of
Miss
Fairlie
,
"
I
continue
,
"
and
no
fear
of
get
into
trouble
through
the
letter
.
<EOS>
She
know
so
much
about
it
already
,
that
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
tell
her
all
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
little
necessity
for
concealment
where
there
be
hardly
anything
leave
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
You
mention
no
name
in
the
letter
;
but
Miss
Fairlie
know
that
the
person
you
write
of
be
Sir
Percival
Glyde
 
"
  
<EOS>
the
instant
I
pronounce
that
name
<EOS>
she
start
to
her
foot
,
and
a
scream
burst
from
her
that
ring
through
the
churchyard
,
and
make
my
heart
leap
in
me
with
the
terror
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
dark
deformity
of
the
expression
which
have
just
leave
her
face
lower
on
it
once
more
,
with
double
and
trebled
intensity
.
<EOS>
the
shriek
at
the
name
,
the
reiterated
look
of
hatred
and
fear
that
instantly
follow
,
tell
all
.
<EOS>
not
even
a
last
doubt
now
remain
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
guiltless
of
imprison
her
in
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
a
man
have
shut
her
up
 
and
that
man
be
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
the
scream
have
reach
other
ear
than
mine
.
<EOS>
on
one
side
I
hear
the
door
of
the
sexton
's
cottage
open
;
on
the
other
I
hear
the
voice
of
her
companion
,
the
woman
in
the
shawl
,
the
woman
whom
she
have
speak
of
as
Mrs.
Clements
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
!
<EOS>
I
be
come
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
voice
from
behind
the
clump
of
dwarf
tree
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
moment
more
Mrs.
Clements
hurry
into
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
face
me
resolutely
as
she
set
her
foot
on
the
stile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
dare
you
frighten
a
poor
helpless
woman
like
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
at
Anne
Catherick
's
side
,
and
have
put
one
arm
around
her
,
before
I
could
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
be
it
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
what
have
he
do
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
"
the
poor
creature
answer
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
frightened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
turn
on
me
with
a
fearless
indignation
,
for
which
I
respect
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
if
I
deserve
that
angry
look
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
unfortunately
startle
her
without
intend
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
first
time
she
have
see
me
.
<EOS>
ask
her
yourself
,
and
she
will
tell
you
that
I
be
incapable
of
willingly
harm
her
or
any
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
speak
distinctly
,
so
that
Anne
Catherick
may
hear
and
understand
me
,
and
I
see
that
the
word
and
their
meaning
have
reach
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
she
say
 
"
he
be
good
to
me
once
 
he
help
me
 
<EOS>
"
She
whisper
the
rest
into
her
friend
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
strange
,
indeed
!
"
say
Mrs.
Clements
,
with
a
look
of
perplexity
.
<EOS>
"
It
make
all
the
difference
,
though
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
I
speak
so
rough
to
you
,
sir
;
but
you
must
own
that
appearance
look
suspicious
to
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
my
fault
than
yours
,
for
humour
her
whim
,
and
let
her
be
alone
in
such
a
place
as
this
.
<EOS>
come
,
my
dear
 
come
home
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
the
good
woman
look
a
little
uneasy
at
the
prospect
of
the
walk
back
,
and
I
offer
to
go
with
them
until
they
be
both
within
sight
of
home
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
thank
me
civilly
,
and
decline
.
<EOS>
She
say
they
be
sure
to
meet
some
of
the
farm
-
labourer
as
soon
as
they
get
to
the
moor
.
  
<EOS>
"
try
to
forgive
me
,
"
I
say
,
when
Anne
Catherick
take
her
friend
's
arm
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
innocent
as
I
have
be
of
any
intention
to
terrify
and
agitate
her
,
my
heart
smite
me
as
I
look
at
the
poor
,
pale
,
frightened
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
know
too
much
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
you
will
always
frighten
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
glance
at
me
,
and
shake
her
head
pityingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
night
,
sir
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
could

I

frighten
,
and
not
her

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
move
away
a
few
step
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
have
leave
me
,
but
Anne
suddenly
stop
,
and
separate
herself
from
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
wait
a
little
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
good
-
bye

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
return
to
the
grave
,
rest
both
hand
tenderly
on
the
marble
cross
,
and
kiss
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
well
now

she
sigh
,
look
up
at
me
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
I
forgive
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
join
her
companion
again
,
and
they
leave
the
burial
-
ground
.
<EOS>
I
see
them
stop
near
the
church
and
speak
to
the
sexton
's
wife
,
who
have
come
from
the
cottage
,
and
have
wait
,
watch
us
from
a
distance
.
<EOS>
then
they
go
on
again
up
the
path
that
lead
to
the
moor
.
<EOS>
I
look
after
Anne
Catherick
as
she
disappear
,
till
all
trace
of
her
have
fade
in
the
twilight
 
look
as
anxiously
and
sorrowfully
as
if
that
be
the
last
<EOS>
I
be
to
see
in
this
weary
world
of
the
woman
in
white
.
    
<EOS>
half
an
hour
later
I
be
back
at
the
house
,
and
be
inform
Miss
Halcombe
of
all
that
have
happen
.
  
<EOS>
She
listen
to
me
from
begin
to
end
with
a
steady
,
silent
attention
,
which
,
in
a
woman
of
her
temperament
and
disposition
,
be
the
strong
proof
that
could
be
offer
of
the
serious
manner
in
which
my
narrative
affect
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mind
misgive
me

"
be
all
she
say
when
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

misgive
me
sadly
about
the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
future
may
depend
,
"
I
suggest
,
"
on
the
use
we
make
of
the
present

<EOS>
It
be
not
improbable
that
Anne
Catherick
may
speak
more
readily
and
unreservedly
to
a
woman
than
she
have
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
if
Miss
Fairlie

"
not

Miss
Halcombe

most
decide
manner

<EOS>
"
let
me
suggest

I
continue

that
you
should

Catherick

all

for
my
own
part

I
shrink
from
the
idea
of
alarm
the
poor
creature
a
second

as
I
have
most
unhappily
alarm
her
already

do
you

any
objection

none

go
backwards

She
ring
the
bell

send
the
servant
with
his
message
.
<EOS>
He
return
,
and
announce
that
the
dairymaid

<EOS>
She
have
not
be
there
for
the
last
three
day

the
housekeeper

give
her
leave

go
home

Asylum

there
be
not

<EOS>
the
only
mystery

remain

the
mystery

motive

<EOS>
look
to
the
great
difference
between
his
station

seem
to
preclude
all

We
part
for

<EOS>
after
breakfast
the
next
morning

an
obstacle

the
event
of
the
evening
before
have
put
out
of
my
memory

interpose
to
prevent
our
proceeding
immediately
to
the
farm

<EOS>
this
be
my
last
day
at
Limmeridge
House
,
and
it
be
necessary
,
as
soon
as
the
post
come
in
,
to
follow
Miss
Halcombe
's
advice
,
and
to
ask
Mr.
Fairlie

permission
to
shorten
my
engagement
by
a
month
,
in
consideration
of
an
unforeseen
necessity
for
my

London

<EOS>
fortunately
for
the
probability

this
excuse

so
far
as
appearance

concern
,
the
post
bring
me
two
letter
from
London
friend

morning

<EOS>
I
take
them
away
at

to
my

send
the
servant
with
a
message
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
request
to
know
when
I
could
see
him
on
a
matter
of
business

<EOS>
I
await
the
man
's
return
,
free
from
the
slight
feeling
of
anxiety
about
the
manner
in
which
his
master
may
receive
my
application
.
<EOS>
with
Mr.
Fairlie
's
leave
or
without
it
,
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
the
consciousness
of
have
now
take
the
first
step
on
the
dreary
journey
which
be
henceforth
to
separate
my
life
from
Miss

have
blunt
my
sensibility

<EOS>
I
have
do
with

's
touchy
pride

I

with
all
my

vanity

<EOS>
no
insolence
of
Mr.

,
if
he
choose

be
insolent

could
wound
me
now

<EOS>
the
servant
return
with
a
message
for
which
I
be
not
unprepared

<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
regret
that
the
state
of
his
health
,
on
that
particular
morning
,
be
such
as
to
preclude
all
hope
of
his
have
the
pleasure
of
receive
me

<EOS>
He
beg
,
therefore
,
that
I
would
accept
his
apology
,
and
kindly
communicate
what
I
have
to
say
in
the
form
of
a
letter
.
<EOS>
similar
message
to
this
have
reach
me
,
at
various
interval
,
during
my
three
month
'
residence
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
throughout
the
whole
of
that
period
Mr.
Fairlie
have
be
rejoice
to
"
possess
"
me
,
but
have
never
be
well
enough
to
see
me
for
a
second

<EOS>
the
servant
take
every
fresh
batch

drawing
that
I
mount

restore
back
to

that
the
state

his
health
still
oblige
him
to
remain

solitary
prisoner

<EOS>
a
more
satisfactory
arrangement
to
both
side
could
not
possibly
have
be
adopt
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
hard
to
say
which
of
us
,
under
the
circumstance
,
feel
the
most
grateful
sense
of
obligation
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
accommodate
nerve

<EOS>
I
sit
down
at
once
to
write
the

Mr.

Mr.

be
more
surprised
and
disappointed
than
he
can
say
(
in
the
present
state
of
his
health
)
by
Mr.
Hartright
's
application
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
be
not
a
man
of
business
,
but
he
have
consult
his
steward
,
who
be
,
and
that
person
confirm
Mr.
Fairlie
's
opinion
that
Mr.
Hartright
's
request
to
be
allow
to
break
his
engagement
can
not
be
justify
by
any
necessity
whatever
,
except
perhaps
a
case
of
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
if
the
highly

appreciative
feeling
towards
art
and
its
professor
,
which
it
be
the
consolation
and
happiness
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
suffer
existence
to
cultivate
,
could
be
easily
shake
,
Mr.
Hartright
's
present
proceeding
would
have
shake
it
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
do
so
 
except
in
the
instance
of
Mr.
Hartright
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
state
his
opinion
 
so
far
,
that
be
to
say
,
as
acute
nervous
suffering
will
allow
him
to
state
anything
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
have
nothing
to
add
but
the
expression
of
his
decision
,
in
reference
to
the
highly
irregular
application
that
have
be
make
to
him

<EOS>
perfect
repose
of
body
and
mind
be
to
the
last
degree
important
in
his

not
suffer
Mr.
Hartright

disturb
that
repose
by
remain
in
the
house
under
circumstance
of
an
essentially
irritate
nature
to
both
side

<EOS>
accordingly
,
Mr.
Fairlie
waive
his
right
of
refusal
,
purely
with
a
view
to
the
preservation
of
his
own
tranquillity
 
and
inform
Mr.
Hartright
that
he
may
go
.

"
  
<EOS>
I
fold
the
letter
up
,
and
put
it
away
with
my
other
paper
.
<EOS>
the
time
have
be
when
I
should
have
resent
it
as
an
insult
 
<EOS>
I
accept
it
now
as
a
write
release
from
my
engagement
.
<EOS>
It
be
off
my
mind
,
it
be
almost
out
of
my
memory
,
when
I
go
downstairs
to
the
breakfast
-
room
,
and
inform
Miss
Halcombe
that
I
be
ready
to
walk
with
her
to
the
farm
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
Mr.
Fairlie
give
you
a
satisfactory
answer
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
as
we
leave
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
allow
me
to
go
,
Miss
Halcombe
.

"
  
<EOS>
She
look
up
at
me
quickly
,
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
since
I
have
know
her
,
take
my
arm
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
no
word
could
have
express
so
delicately
that
she
understand
how
the
permission
to
leave
my
employment
have
be
grant
,
and
that
she
give
me
her
sympathy
,
not
as
my
superior
,
but
as
my
friend
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
feel
the
man
's
insolent
letter
,
but
I
feel
deeply
the
woman
's
atone
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
on
our
way
to
the
farm
we
arrange
that
Miss
Halcombe
be
to
enter
the
house
alone
,
and
that
I
be
to
wait
outside
,
within
call
.
<EOS>
We
adopt
this
mode
of
proceed
from
an
apprehension
that
my
presence
,
after
what
have
happen
in
the
churchyard
the
evening
before
,
may
have
the
effect
of
renew
Anne
Catherick
's
nervous
dread
,
and
of
render
her
additionally
distrustful
of
the
advance
of
a
lady
who
be
a
stranger
to
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
leave
me
,
with
the
intention
of
speak
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
the
farmer
's
wife
(
of
whose
friendly
readiness
to
help
her
in
any
way
she
be
well
assure
)
,
while
I
wait
for
her
in
the
near
neighbourhood
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
fully
expect
to
be
leave
alone
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
to
my
surprise
,
however
,
little
more
than
five
minute
have
elapse
before
Miss
Halcombe
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
Anne
Catherick
refuse
to
see
you

I
ask
in
astonishment

Miss
Halcombe

<EOS>
"

<EOS>

go
with
Mrs.
Clements

<EOS>
They
both
leave
the
farm
at
eight
o'clock
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
could
say
nothing
 
I
could
only
feel
that
our
last
chance
of
discovery
have
go
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
that
Mrs.
Todd
know
about
her
guest
,
I
know
,

Miss
Halcombe
go
on

and
it
leave
me
,
as
it
leave
her
,
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
They
both
come
back
safe
last
night
,
after
they
leave
you
,
and
they
pass
the
first
part
of
the
evening
with
Mr.
Todd
's
family
as
usual
.
<EOS>
just
before
supper
-
time
,
however
,
Anne
Catherick
startle
them
all
by
be
suddenly
seize
with
faintness
.
<EOS>
She
have
have
a
similar
attack
,
of
a
less
alarming
kind
,
on
the
day
she
arrive
at
the
farm
;
and
Mrs.
Todd
have
connect
it
,
on
that
occasion
,
with
something
she
be
read
at
the
time
in
our
local
newspaper
,
which
lie
on
the
farm
table
,
and
which
she
have
take
up
only
a
minute
or
two
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Mrs.
Todd
know
what
particular
passage
in
the
newspaper
affect
her
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
look
it
over
,
and
have
see
nothing
in
it
to
agitate
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
ask
leave
,
however
,
to
look
it
over
in
my
turn
,
and
at
the
very
first
page
I
open
I
find
that
the
editor
have
enrich
his
small
stock
of
news
by
draw
upon
our
family
affair
,
and
have
publish
my
sister
's
marriage
engagement
,
among
his
other
announcement
,
copy
from
the
London
paper
,
of
Marriages
in
High
Life
.
<EOS>
I
conclude
at
once
that
this
be
the
paragraph
which
have
so
strangely
affect
Anne
Catherick
,
and
I
think
I
see
in
it
,
also
,
the
origin
of
the
letter
which
she
send
to
our
house
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
can
be
no
doubt
in
either
case
.
<EOS>
but
what
do
you
hear
about
her
second
attack
of
faintness
yesterday
evening
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
cause
of
it
be
a
complete
mystery
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
stranger
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
only
visitor
be
our
dairymaid
,
who
,
as
I
tell
you
,
be
one
of
Mr.
Todd
's
daughter
,
and
the
only
conversation
be
the
usual
gossip
about
local
affair
.
<EOS>
They
hear
her
cry
out
,
and
see
her
turn
deadly
pale
,
without
the
slight
apparent
reason
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Todd
and
Mrs.
Clements
take
her
upstairs
,
and
Mrs.
Clements
remain
with
her
.
<EOS>
They
be
hear
talk
together
until
long
after
the
usual
bedtime
,
and
early
this
morning
Mrs.
Clements
take
Mrs.
Todd
aside
,
and
amaze
her
beyond
all
power
of
expression
by
say
that
they
must
go
.
<EOS>
the
only
explanation
Mrs.
Todd
could
extract
from
her
guest
be
,
that
something
have
happen
,
which
be
not
the
fault
of
any
one
at
the
farmhouse
,
but
which
be
serious
enough
to
make
Anne
Catherick
resolve
to
leave
Limmeridge
immediately
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
useless
to
press
Mrs.
Clements
to
be
more
explicit
.
<EOS>
She
only
shake
her
head
,
and
say
that
,
for
Anne
's
sake
,
she
must
beg
and
pray
that
no
one
would
question
her
.
<EOS>
all
she
could
repeat
,
with
every
appearance
of
be
seriously
agitate
herself
,
be
that
Anne
must
go
,
that
she
must
go
with
her
,
and
that
the
destination
to
which
they
may
both
betake
themselves
must
be
keep
a
secret
from
everybody
.
<EOS>
I
spare
you
the
recital
of
Mrs.
Todd
's
hospitable
remonstrance
and
refusal
.
<EOS>
It
end
in
her
drive
them
both
to
the
near
station
,
more
than
three
hour
since
.
<EOS>
She
try
hard
on
the
way
to
get
them
to
speak
more
plainly
,
but
without
success
;
and
she
set
them
down
outside
the
station
-
door
,
so
hurt
and
offend
by
the
unceremonious
abruptness
of
their
departure
and
their
unfriendly
reluctance
to
place
the
least
confidence
in
her
,
that
she
drive
away
in
anger
,
without
so
much
as
stop
to
bid
them
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
that
be
exactly
what
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
search
your
own
memory
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
and
tell
me
if
anything
happen
in
the
burial
-
ground
yesterday
evening
which
can
at
all
account
for
the
extraordinary
departure
of
those
two
woman
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
should
like
to
account
first
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
for
the
sudden
change
in
Anne
Catherick
which
alarm
them
at
the
farmhouse
,
hour
after
she
and
I
have
part
,
and
when
time
enough
have
elapse
to
quiet
any
violent
agitation
that
I
may
have
be
unfortunate
enough
to
cause
.
<EOS>
do
you
inquire
particularly
about
the
gossip
which
be
go
on
in
the
room
when
she
turn
faint
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Todd
's
household
affair
seem
to
have
divide
her
attention
that
evening
with
the
talk
in
the
farmhouse
parlour
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
tell
me
that
it
be
"
just
the
news
,
"
 
meaning
,
I
suppose
,
that
they
all
talk
as
usual
about
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
dairymaid
's
memory
may
be
well
than
her
mother
's
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
as
well
for
you
to
speak
to
the
girl
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
as
soon
as
we
get
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
suggestion
be
act
on
the
moment
we
return
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
lead
me
round
to
the
servant
'
office
,
and
we
find
the
girl
in
the
dairy
,
with
her
sleeve
tuck
up
to
her
shoulder
,
clean
a
large
milk
-
pan
and
singe
blithely
over
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
bring
this
gentleman
to
see
your
dairy
,
Hannah
,
"
say
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
one
of
the
sight
of
the
house
,
and
it
always
do
you
credit
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
girl
blush
and
curtsey
,
and
say
shyly
that
she
hope
she
always
do
her
good
to
keep
thing
neat
and
clean
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
just
come
from
your
father
's
,
"
Miss
Halcombe
continue
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
there
yesterday
evening
,
I
hear
,
and
you
find
visitor
at
the
house

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
"
one
of
them
be

<EOS>
I
suppose
nothing

or
do
to
frighten
her
?
<EOS>
You
be
not
talk
of
anything
very
terrible
,
be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

<EOS>
"
say
the
girl
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
only

of
the
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sister

you
the
news

Todd
's
Corner

I
suppose

<EOS>
"
  
"
yes

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
tell
them
the
news
at
Limmeridge
House
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
miss
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
quite
sure
nothing
be
say
to
frighten
the
poor
thing
,
for
I
be
talk
when
she
be
take
ill

<EOS>
It
give
me
quite
a
turn
,
miss
,
to
see
it
,
never
have
be
take
faint
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
before
any
more
question
could
be
put
to
her
,
she
be
call
away
to
receive
a
basket
of
egg
at
the
dairy
door
.
<EOS>
as
she
leave
us
I
whisper
to
Miss
Halcombe
    
<EOS>
"
ask
her
if
she
happen
to
mention
,
last
night
,
that
visitor

"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
show
me
,
by
a
look
,
that
she
understand
,
and
put
the
question
as
soon
as
the
dairymaid
return
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh

<EOS>

say
the
girl
simply
.

<EOS>

Mr.
Hartright

Hannah

us
in
the
way
,
if

interrupt
her
any
longer
over
her
work

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
stop
and
look
at
one
another
the
moment
we
be
alone
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
any
doubt
in
your
mind
,
now
,
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Percival
Glyde
shall
remove
that
doubt
,
Mr.
Hartright

Laura
Fairlie
shall
never
be
his
wife

"
    
<EOS>
as
we
walk
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
a
fly
from
the
railway
approach
us
along
the
drive
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
wait
on
the
door
-
step
until
the
fly
draw
up
,
and
then
advance
to
shake
hand
with
an
old
gentleman
,
who
get
out
briskly
the
moment
the
step
be
let
down
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
have
arrive
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
,
when
we
be
introduce
to
each
other
,
with
an
interest
and
a
curiosity
which
I
could
hardly
conceal
.
<EOS>
this
old
man
be
to
remain
at
Limmeridge
House
after
I
have
leave
it
,
he
be
to
hear
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
explanation
,
and
be
to
give
Miss
Halcombe
the
assistance
of
his
experience
in
form
her
judgment
;
he
be
to
wait
until
the
question
of
the
marriage
be
set
at
rest
;
and
his
hand
,
if
that
question
be
decide
in
the
affirmative
,
be
to
draw
the
settlement
which
bind
Miss
Fairlie
irrevocably
to
her
engagement
.
<EOS>
even
then
,
when
I
know
nothing
by
comparison
with
what
I
know
now
,
I
look
at
the
family
lawyer
with
an
interest
which
I
have
never
feel
before
in
the
presence
of
any
man
breathe
who
be
a
total
stranger
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
in
external
appearance
Mr.
Gilmore
be
the
exact
opposite
of
the
conventional
idea
of
an
old
lawyer
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
be
florid
 
<EOS>
his
white
hair
be
wear
rather
long
and
keep
carefully
brush
 
his
black
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
trouser
fit
him
with
perfect
neatness
 
<EOS>
his
white
cravat
be
carefully
tie
,
and
his
lavender
-
colour
kid
glove
may
have
adorn
the
hand
of
a
fashionable
clergyman
,
without
fear
and
without
reproach
.
<EOS>
His
manner
be
pleasantly
mark
by
the
formal
grace
and
refinement
of
the
old
school
of
politeness
,
quicken
by
the
invigorate
sharpness
and
readiness
of
a
man
whose
business
in
life
oblige
him
always
to
keep
his
faculty
in
good
working
order
.
<EOS>
a
sanguine
constitution
and
fair
prospect
to
begin
with
 
a
long
subsequent
career
of
creditable
and
comfortable
prosperity
 
a
cheerful
,
diligent
,
widely
-
respect
old
age
 
such
be
the
general
impression
I
derive
from
my
introduction
to
Mr.
Gilmore
,
and
it
be
but
fair
to
him
to
add
,
that
the
knowledge
I
gain
by
later
and
well
experience
only
tend
to
confirm
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
the
old
gentleman
and
Miss
Halcombe
to
enter
the
house
together
,
and
to
talk
of
family
matter
undisturbed
by
the
restraint
of
a
stranger
's
presence
.
<EOS>
They
cross
the
hall
on
their
way
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
I
descend
the
step
again
to
wander
about
the
garden
alone
.
  
<EOS>
My
hour
be
number
at
Limmeridge
House
 
my
departure
the
next
morning
be
irrevocably
settle
 
<EOS>
my
share
in
the
investigation
which
the
anonymous
letter
have
render
necessary
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
no
harm
could
be
do
to
any
one
but
myself
if
I
let
my
heart
loose
again
,
for
the
little
time
that
be
leave
me
,
from
the
cold
cruelty
of
restraint
which
necessity
have
force
me
to
inflict
upon
it
,
and
take
my
farewell
of
the
scene
which
be
associate
with
the
brief
dream
-
time
of
my
happiness
and
my
love
.
  
<EOS>
I
turn
instinctively
to
the
walk
beneath
my
study
-
window
,
where
I
have
see
her
the
evening
before
with
her
little
dog
,
and
follow
the
path
which
her
dear
foot
have
trodden
so
often
,
till
I
come
to
the
wicket
gate
that
lead
into
her
rose
garden
.
<EOS>
the
winter
bareness
spread
drearily
over
it
now
.
<EOS>
the
flower
that
she
have
teach
me
to
distinguish
by
their
name
,
the
flower
that
I
have
teach
her
to
paint
from
,
be
go
,
and
the
tiny
white
path
that
lead
between
the
bed
be
damp
and
green
already
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
to
the
avenue
of
tree
,
where
we
have
breathe
together
the
warm
fragrance
of
August
evening
,
where
we
have
admire
together
the
myriad
combination
of
shade
and
sunlight
that
dapple
the
ground
at
our
foot
.
<EOS>
the
leave
fall
about
me
from
the
groaning
branch
,
and
the
earthy
decay
in
the
atmosphere
chill
me
to
the
bone
.
<EOS>
a
little
farther
on
,
<EOS>
and
I
be
out
of
the
ground
,
and
follow
the
lane
that
wound
gently
upward
to
the
near
hill
.
<EOS>
the
old
fell
tree
by
the
wayside
,
on
which
we
have
sit
to
rest
,
be
sodden
with
rain
,
and
the
tuft
of
fern
and
grass
which
I
have
draw
for
her
,
nestle
under
the
rough
stone
wall
in
front
of
us
,
have
turn
to
a
pool
of
water
,
stagnate
round
an
island
of
draggle
weed
.
<EOS>
I
gain
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
and
look
at
the
view
which
we
have
so
often
admire
in
the
happy
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
cold
and
barren
 
<EOS>
it
be
no
longer
the
view
that
I
remember
.
<EOS>
the
sunshine
of
her
presence
be
far
from
me
 
the
charm
of
her
voice
no
longer
murmur
in
my
ear
.
<EOS>
She
have
talk
to
me
,
on
the
spot
from
which
I
now
look
down
,
of
her
father
,
who
be
her
last
survive
parent
 
have
tell
me
how
fond
of
each
other
they
have
be
,
and
how
sadly
she
miss
him
still
when
she
enter
certain
room
in
the
house
,
and
when
she
take
up
forget
occupation
and
amusement
with
which
he
have
be
associate
.
<EOS>
be
the
view
that
I
have
see
,
while
listen
to
those
word
,
the
view
that
I
see
now
,
stand
on
the
hill
-
top
by
myself
?
<EOS>
I
turn
and
leave
it
 
<EOS>
I
wound
my
way
back
again
,
over
the
moor
,
and
round
the
sandhill
,
down
to
the
beach
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
white
rage
of
the
surf
,
and
the
multitudinous
glory
of
the
leaping
wave
 
but
<EOS>
where
be
the
place
on
which
she
have
once
draw
idle
figure
with
her
parasol
in
the
sand
 
<EOS>
the
place
where
we
have
sit
together
,
while
she
talk
to
me
about
myself
and
my
home
,
while
she
ask
me
a
woman
's
minutely
observant
question
about
my
mother
and
my
sister
,
and
innocently
wonder
whether
I
should
ever
leave
my
lonely
chamber
and
have
a
wife
and
a
house
of
my
own
?
<EOS>
wind
and
wave
have
long
since
smooth
out
the
trace
of
her
which
she
have
leave
in
those
mark
on
the
sand
,
I
look
over
the
wide
monotony
of
the
sea
-
side
prospect
,
and
the
place
in
which
we
two
have
idle
away
the
sunny
hour
be
as
lose
to
me
as
if
I
have
never
know
it
,
as
strange
to
me
as
if
I
stand
already
on
a
foreign
shore
.
  
<EOS>
the
empty
silence
of
the
beach
strike
cold
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
return
to
the
house
and
the
garden
,
where
trace
be
leave
to
speak
of
her
at
every
turn
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
west
terrace
walk
I
meet
Mr.
Gilmore
.

passionately

satirically

His
have

he
have
just

<EOS>
He
evidently
attribute
Miss
Halcombe
's
abrupt
change
in
the
card

table
arrangement
to
a
lady
's
inability
to
play
the

<EOS>
She
keep
her
place
at
the
piano

and
I
keep
mine
at
the
card

table
.
<EOS>
She
play
unintermittingly
 
play
as
if
the
music
be
her
only
refuge
from
herself
.
<EOS>
sometimes
her
finger
touch
the
note
with
a
linger
fondness
 
a
soft
,
plaintive
,
die
tenderness
,
unutterably
beautiful
and
mournful
to
hear
;
sometimes
they
falter
and
fail
her
,
or
hurry
over
the
instrument
mechanically
,
as
if
their
task
be
a
burden
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
still
,
change
and
waver
as
they
may
in
the
expression
they
impart
to
the
music
,
their
resolution
to
play
never
falter
.
<EOS>
She
only
rise
from

rise
to
say
good

<EOS>
in

silence

sit
down
together

I
turn

where
nothing
face

lonely
autumn
landscape

<EOS>
then
,
with
that
courage

often
in
the
small
emergency
,
and
so
seldom
in
the
great
,

strangely
pale

draw
one

remind
me
of
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
play
to
us
in
the
evening
 
not
so
well
as
usual
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
rubber
at
whist
,
a
mere
profanation
,
so
far
as
play
be
concern
,
of
that
noble
game
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
favourably
impress
by
Mr.
Hartright
on
our
first
introduction
to
one
another
,
but
I
soon
discover
that
he
be
not
free
from
the
social
failing
incidental
to
his
age
.
<EOS>
there
be
three
thing
that
none
of
the
young
man
of
the
present
generation
can
do
.
<EOS>
They
can
not
sit
over
their
wine
,
they
can
not
play
at
whist
,
and
they
can
not
pay
a
lady
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
be
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
.
<EOS>
otherwise
,
even
in
those
early
day
and
on
that
short
acquaintance
,
he
strike
me
as
be
a
modest
and
gentlemanlike
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
Friday
pass
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
about
the
more
serious
matter
which
engage
my
attention
on
that
day
 
the
anonymous
letter
to
Miss
Fairlie
,
the
measure
I
think
it
right
to
adopt
when
the
matter
be
mention
to
me
,
and
the
conviction
I
entertain
that
every
possible
explanation
of
the
circumstance
would
be
readily
afford
by
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
have
all
be
fully
notice
,
as
I
understand
,
in
the
narrative
which
precede
this
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Saturday
Mr.
Hartright
have
leave
before
I
get
down
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
keep
her
room
all
day
,
and
Miss
Halcombe
appear
to
me
to
be
out
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
not
what
it
use
to
be
in
the
time
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Philip
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
walk
by
myself
in
the
forenoon
,
and
look
about
at
some
of
the
place
which
I
first
see
when
I
be
stay
at
Limmeridge
to
transact
family
business
,
more
than
thirty
year
since
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
what
they
use
to
be
either
.
  
<EOS>
at
two
o'clock
Mr.
Fairlie
send
to
say
he
be
well
enough
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
he
have
not
alter
,
at
any
rate
,
since
I
first
know
him
.
<EOS>
His
talk
be
to
the
same
purpose
as
usual
 
all
about
himself
and
his
ailment
,
his
wonderful
coin
,
and
his
matchless
Rembrandt
etching
.
<EOS>
the
moment
I
try
to
speak
of
the
business
that
have
bring
me
to
his
house
,
he
shut
his
eye
and
say
I
"
upset
"
him
.
<EOS>
I
persist
in
upset
him
by
return
again
and
again
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
all
I
could
ascertain
be
that
he
look
on
his
niece
's
marriage
as
a
settle
thing
,
that
her
father
have
sanction
it
,
that
he
sanction
it
himself
,
that
it
be
a
desirable
marriage
,
and
that
he
should
be
personally
rejoice
when
the
worry
of
it
be
over
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
settlement
,
if
I
would
consult
his
niece
,
and
afterwards
dive
as
deeply
as
I
please
into
my
own
knowledge
of
the
family
affair
,
and
get
everything
ready
,
and
limit
his
share
in
the
business
,
as
guardian
,
to
say
yes
,
at
the
right
moment
 
why
,
of
course
he
would
meet
my
view
,
and
everybody
else
's
view
,
with
infinite
pleasure
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
there
I
see
him
,
a
helpless
sufferer
,
confine
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
do
I
think
he
look
as
if
he
want
tease
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
then
why
tease
him
?
  
<EOS>
I
may
,
perhaps
,
have
be
a
little
astonished
at
this
extraordinary
absence
of
all
self
-
assertion
on
Mr.
Fairlie
's
part
,
in
the
character
of
guardian
,
if
my
knowledge
of
the
family
affair
have
not
be
sufficient
to
remind
me
that
he
be
a
single
man
,
and
that
he
have
nothing
more
than
a
life
-
interest
in
the
Limmeridge
property
.
<EOS>
as
matter
stand
,
therefore
,
I
be
neither
surprised
nor
disappointed
at
the
result
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
have
simply
justify
my
expectation
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
be
a
dull
day
,
out
of
door
and
in
.
<EOS>
a
letter
arrive
for
me
from
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
solicitor
,
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
my
copy
of
the
anonymous
letter
and
my
accompanying
statement
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
join
us
in
the
afternoon
,
look
pale
and
depressed
,
and
altogether
unlike
herself
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
talk
with
her
,
and
venture
on
a
delicate
allusion
to
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
She
listen
and
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
all
other
subject
she
pursue
willingly
,
but
this
subject
she
allow
to
drop
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
doubt
whether
she
may
not
be
repent
of
her
engagement
 
just
as
young
lady
often
do
,
when
repentance
come
too
late
.
  
<EOS>
on
Monday
Sir
Percival
Glyde
arrive
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
him
to
be
a
most
prepossessing
man
,
so
far
as
manner
and
appearance
be
concern
.
<EOS>
He
look
rather
old
than
I
have
expect
,
his
head
be
bald
over
the
forehead
,
and
his
face
somewhat
marked
and
worn
,
but
his
movement
be
as
active
and
his
spirit
as
high
as
a
young
man
's
.
<EOS>
His
meeting
with
Miss
Halcombe
be
delightfully
hearty
and
unaffected
,
and
his
reception
of
me
,
upon
my
be
present
to
him
,
be
so
easy
and
pleasant
that
we
get
on
together
like
old
friend
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
be
not
with
us
when
he
arrive
,
but
she
enter
the
room
about
ten
minute
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
rise
and
pay
his
compliment
with
perfect
grace
.
<EOS>
His
evident
concern
on
see
the
change
for
the
bad
in
the
young
lady
's
look
be
express
with
a
mixture
of
tenderness
and
respect
,
with
an
unassume
delicacy
of
tone
,
voice
,
and
manner
,
which
do
equal
credit
to
his
good
breeding
and
his
good
sense
.
<EOS>
I
be
rather
surprised
,
under
these
circumstance
,
to
see
that
Miss
Fairlie
continue
to
be
constrain
and
uneasy
in
his
presence
,
and
that
she
take
the
first
opportunity
of
leave
the
room
again
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
neither
notice
the
restraint
in
her
reception
of
him
,
nor
her
sudden
withdrawal
from
our
society
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
obtrude
his
attention
on
her
while
she
be
present
,
and
he
do
not
embarrass
Miss
Halcombe
by
any
allusion
to
her
departure
when
she
be
go
.
<EOS>
His
tact
and
taste
be
never
at
fault
on
this
or
on
any
other
occasion
while
I
be
in
his
company
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Miss
Fairlie
have
leave
the
room
he
spare
us
all
embarrassment
on
the
subject
of
the
anonymous
letter
,
by
advert
to
it
of
his
own
accord
.
<EOS>
He
have
stop
in
London
on
his
way
from
Hampshire
,
have
see
his
solicitor
,
have
read
the
document
forward
by
me
,
and
have
travel
on
to
Cumberland
,
anxious
to
satisfy
our
mind
by
the
speedy
and
the
full
explanation
that
word
could
convey
.
<EOS>
on
hear
him
express
himself
to
this
effect
,
I
offer
him
the
original
letter
,
which
I
have
keep
for
his
inspection
.
<EOS>
He
thank
me
,
and
decline
to
look
at
it
,
say
that
he
have
see
the
copy
,
and
that
he
be
quite
willing
to
leave
the
original
in
our
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
statement
itself
,
on
which
he
immediately
enter
,
be
as
simple
and
satisfactory
as
I
have
all
along
anticipate
it
would
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
,
he
inform
us
,
have
in
past
year
lay
him
under
some
obligation
for
faithful
service
render
to
his
family
connection
and
to
himself
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
doubly
unfortunate
in
be
marry
to
a
husband
who
have
desert
her
,
and
in
have
an
only
child
whose
mental
faculty
have
be
in
a
disturbed
condition
from
a
very
early
age
.
<EOS>
although
her
marriage
have
remove
her
to
a
part
of
Hampshire
far
distant
from
the
neighbourhood
in
which
Sir
Percival
's
property
be
situate
,
he
have
take
care
not
to
lose
sight
of
her
 
his
friendly
feeling
towards
the
poor
woman
,
in
consideration
of
her
past
service
,
have
be
greatly
strengthen
by
his
admiration
of
the
patience
and
courage
with
which
she
support
her
calamity
.
<EOS>
in
course
of
time
the
symptom
of
mental
affliction
in
her
unhappy
daughter
increase
to
such
a
serious
extent
,
as
to
make
it
a
matter
of
necessity
to
place
her
under
proper
medical
care
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
herself
recognise
this
necessity
,
but
she
also
feel
the
prejudice
common
to
person
occupy
her
respectable
station
,
against
allow
her
child
to
be
admit
,
as
a
pauper
,
into
a
public
Asylum
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
respect
this
prejudice
,
as
he
respect
honest
independence
of
feeling
in
any
rank
of
life
,
and
have
resolve
to
mark
his
grateful
sense
of
Mrs.
Catherick
's
early
attachment
to
the
interest
of
himself
and
his
family
,
by
defray
the
expense
of
her
daughter
's
maintenance
in
a
trustworthy
private
Asylum
.
<EOS>
to
her
mother
's
regret
,
and
to
his
own
regret
,
the
unfortunate
creature
have
discover
the
share
which
circumstance
have
induce
him
to
take
in
place
her
under
restraint
,
and
have
conceive
the
most
intense
hatred
and
distrust
of
him
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
to
that
hatred
and
distrust
 
which
have
express
itself
in
various
way
in
the
Asylum
 
<EOS>
the
anonymous
letter
,
write
after
her
escape
,
be
plainly
attributable
.
<EOS>
if
Miss
Halcombe
's
or
Mr.
Gilmore
's
recollection
of
the
document
do
not
confirm
that
view
,
or
if
they
wish
for
any
additional
particular
about
the
Asylum
(
the
address
of
which
he
mention
,
as
well
as
the
name
and
address
of
the
two
doctor
on
whose
certificate
the
patient
be
admit
)
,
he
be
ready
to
answer
any
question
and
to
clear
up
any
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
He
have
do
his
duty
to
the
unhappy
young
woman
,
by
instruct
his
solicitor
to
spare
no
expense
in
trace
her
,
and
in
restore
her
once
more
to
medical
care
,
and
he
be
now
only
anxious
to
do
his
duty
towards
Miss
Fairlie
and
towards
her
family
,
in
the
same
plain
,
straightforward
way
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
the
first
to
speak
in
answer
to
this
appeal
.
<EOS>
My
own
course
be
plain
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
great
beauty
of
the
Law
that
it
can
dispute
any
human
statement
,
make
under
any
circumstance
,
and
reduce
to
any
form
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
feel
professionally
call
upon
to
set
up
a
case
against
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
on
the
strength
of
his
own
explanation
,
I
could
have
do
so
beyond
all
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
my
duty
do
not
lie
in
this
direction
 
<EOS>
my
function
be
of
the
purely
judicial
kind
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
weigh
the
explanation
we
have
just
hear
,
to
allow
all
due
force
to
the
high
reputation
of
the
gentleman
who
offer
it
,
and
to
decide
honestly
whether
the
probability
,
on
Sir
Percival
's
own
showing
,
be
plainly
with
him
,
or
plainly
against
him
.
<EOS>
My
own
conviction
be
that
they
be
plainly
with
him
,
and
I
accordingly
declare
that
his
explanation
be
,
to
my
mind
,
unquestionably
a
satisfactory
one
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
,
after
look
at
me
very
earnestly
,
say
a
few
word
,
on
her
side
,
to
the
same
effect
 
with
a
certain
hesitation
of
manner
,
however
,
which
the
circumstance
do
not
seem
to
me
to
warrant
.
<EOS>
I
be
unable
to
say
,
positively
,
whether
Sir
Percival
notice
this
or
not
.
<EOS>
My
opinion
be
that
he
do
,
see
that
he
pointedly
resume
the
subject
,
although
he
may
now
,
with
all
propriety
,
have
allow
it
to
drop
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
my
plain
statement
of
fact
have
only
be
address
to
Mr.
Gilmore
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
should
consider
any
further
reference
to
this
unhappy
matter
as
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
I
may
fairly
expect
Mr.
Gilmore
,
as
a
gentleman
,
to
believe
me
on
my
word
,
and
when
he
have
do
me
that
justice
,
all
discussion
of
the
subject
between
us
have
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
but
my
position
with
a
lady
be
not
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
owe
to
her
 
what
I
would
concede
to
no
man
alive
 
a
PROOF
of
the
truth
of
my
assertion
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
ask
for
that
proof
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
it
be
therefore
my
duty
to
you
,
and
still
more
to
Miss
Fairlie
,
to
offer
it
.
<EOS>
May
I
beg
that
you
will
write
at
once
to
the
mother
of
this
unfortunate
woman
 
to
Mrs.
Catherick
 
to
ask
for
her
testimony
in
support
of
the
explanation
which
I
have
just
offer
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
see
Miss
Halcombe
change
colour
,
and
look
a
little
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
suggestion
,
politely
as
it
be
express
,
appear
to
her
,
as
it
appear
to
me
,
to
point
very
delicately
at
the
hesitation
which
her
manner
have
betray
a
moment
or
two
since
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Sir
Percival
,
you
do
not
do
me
the
injustice
to
suppose
that
I
distrust
you
,
"
she
say
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
not
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
I
make
my
proposal
purely
as
an
act
of
attention
to
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
excuse
my
obstinacy
if
I
still
venture
to
press
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
walk
to
the
writing
-
table
as
he
speak
,
draw
a
chair
to
it
,
and
open
the
paper
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
beg
you
to
write
the
note
,
"
he
say
,
"
as
a
favour
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
need
not
occupy
you
more
than
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
ask
Mrs.
Catherick
two
question
.
<EOS>
first
,
if
her
daughter
be
place
in
the
Asylum
with
her
knowledge
and
approval
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
if
the
share
I
take
in
the
matter
be
such
as
to
merit
the
expression
of
her
gratitude
towards
myself
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
's
mind
be
at
ease
on
this
unpleasant
subject
,
and
your
mind
be
at
ease
 
<EOS>
pray
set
my
mind
at
ease
also
by
write
the
note
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
oblige
me
to
grant
your
request
,
Sir
Percival
,
when
I
would
much
rather
refuse
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
those
word
Miss
Halcombe
rise
from
her
place
and
go
to
the
writing
-
table
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
thank
her
,
hand
her
a
pen
,
and
then
walk
away
towards

<EOS>
the

look
up

him
sharply
,
shrink
away
from
his

whine
,
shiver
,
and
hide
itself
under
a
sofa

<EOS>
It
be
scarcely
possible
that
he
could
have
be
put
out
by
such
a
trifle
as
a
dog
's
reception
of
him
,
but
I
observe
,
nevertheless
,
that
he
walk
away
towards
the
window
very
suddenly

<EOS>
perhaps
his
temper
be
irritable
at

if
so

I

sympathise

My

He

You

She
may
have
say
something
at
Todd

Corner

I
will
go
there

make
inquiry
on
the
chance

<EOS>
in
the

as
I
can
not
prevail
on
myself
to
discuss
this
painful
subject
with
Miss
Fairlie

may
I
beg
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
that
you
will
kindly
undertake

give

the
necessary
explanation

defer
it

<EOS>
Miss

to
comply
with
his

<EOS>
He
thank
her

nod
pleasantly

leave

to
go

establish
himself
in

grain

out
her
sharp

a

she
go
on

speak
more
to
herself

to
me

<EOS>
but
I
almost
wish
Walter
Hartright
have
stay
here
long
enough
to
be
present
at
the
explanation

to
hear
the
proposal
to
me
to
write
this

event
,
it

connect
Mr.

very
remarkably

readily
admit

conduct
himself

all

consider

with
great
delicacy

discretion

I
be
quite
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
useful
influence
his
presence
could
have
exercise
in
relation
to
the
effect
of
Sir
Percival

statement
on
your

mine

<EOS>

It
be
only
a
fancy

she
say
absently

<EOS>
"
there
be
no
need
to

it

Mr.
Gilmore

Your
experience

to

the
good
guide
I
can
desire

<EOS>
I
do
not
altogether
like
her
thrust
the
whole
responsibility
,
in
this
marked
manner

on
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Fairlie
have
do
it
,
I
should
not
have
be
surprise

<EOS>
but
resolute
,
clear

minded
Miss
Halcombe
be
the
very
last
person
in
the
world
whom
I
should
have
expect
to
find
shrink
from
the
expression
of
an
opinion
of
her
own

if
any
doubt
still
trouble
you

I

why
not

them

me

me
plainly

you
any
reason

Sir
Percival

<EOS>

none
whatever

do
you
see
anything
improbable

contradictory

in
his
explanation

"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
say
I
do
,
after
the
proof
he
have
offer
me
of
the
truth
of
it
?
<EOS>
Can
there
be
well
testimony
in
his
favour
,
Mr.

the
testimony

the
woman

mother

<EOS>
"
none
better

<EOS>
if
the
answer
to
your
note

inquiry
prove

satisfactory

I
for
one

more
any

rise
to

dismiss
all
further
reference
to
the
subject
until
the
answer
arrive
.
<EOS>
do
not
attach
any
weight
to
my
hesitation
.
<EOS>
I
can
give
no
well
reason
for
it
than
that
I
have
be
over
-
anxious
about
Laura
lately
 
and
anxiety
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
unsettle
the
strong
of
us
.

"
  
<EOS>
She
leave
me
abruptly
,
her
naturally
firm
voice
falter
as
she
speak
those
last
word
.
<EOS>
a
sensitive
,
vehement
,
passionate
nature
 
<EOS>
a
woman
of
ten
thousand
in
these
trivial
,
superficial
time
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
her
from
her
early
year
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
her
test
,
as
she
grow
up
,
in
more
than
one
try
family
crisis
,
and
my
long
experience
make
me
attach
an
importance
to
her
hesitation
under
the
circumstance
here
detail
,
which
I
should
certainly
not
have
feel
in
the
case
of
another
woman
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
no
cause
for
any
uneasiness
or
any
doubt
,
but
she
have
make
me
a
little
uneasy
,
and
a
little
doubtful
,
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
in
my
youth
,
I
should
have
chafe
and
fret
under
the
irritation
of
my
own
unreasonable
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
in
my
age
,
I
know
better
,
and
go
out
philosophically
to
walk
it
off
.
    
<EOS>
We
all
meet
again
at
dinner
-
time
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
be
in
such
boisterous
high
spirit
that
I
hardly
recognise
him
as
the
same
man
whose
quiet
tact
,
refinement
,
and
good
sense
have
impress
me
so
strongly
at
the
interview
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
only
trace
of
his
former
self
that
I
could
detect
reappear
,
every
now
and
then
,
in
his
manner
towards
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
a
look
or
a
word
from
her
suspend
his
loud
laugh
,
check
his
gay
flow
of
talk
,
and
render
him
all
attention
to
her
,
and
to
no
one
else
at
table
,
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
although
he
never
openly
try
to
draw
her
into
the
conversation
,
he
never
lose
the
slight
chance
she
give
him
of
let
her
drift
into
it
by
accident
,
and
of
say
the
word
to
her
,
under
those
favourable
circumstance
,
which
a
man
with
less
tact
and
delicacy
would
have
pointedly
address
to
her
the
moment
they
occur
to
him
.
<EOS>
rather
to
my
surprise
,
Miss
Fairlie
appear
to
be
sensible
of
his
attention
without
be
move
by
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
confused
from
time
to
time
when
he
look
at
her
,
or
speak
to
her
;
but
she
never
warm
towards
him
.
<EOS>
rank
,
fortune
,
good
breeding
,
good
look
,
the
respect
of
a
gentleman
,
and
the
devotion
of
a
lover
be
all
humbly
place
at
her
foot
,
and
,
so
far
as
appearance
go
,
be
all
offer
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
,
the
Tuesday
,
Sir
Percival
go
in
the
morning
(
take
one
of
the
servant
with
him
as
a
guide
)
to
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
His
inquiry
,
as
I
afterwards
hear
,
lead
to
no
result
.
<EOS>
on
his
return
he
have
an
interview
with
Mr.
Fairlie
,
and
in
the
afternoon
he
and
Miss
Halcombe
ride
out
together
.
<EOS>
nothing
else
happen
worthy
of
record
.
<EOS>
the
evening
pass
as
usual
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
change
in
Sir
Percival
,
and
no
change
in
Miss
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
the
Wednesday
's
post
bring
with
it
an
event
 
<EOS>
the
reply
from
Mrs.
Catherick

<EOS>
I
take
a
copy

affirmative

both
those

<EOS>
"
  
short
,
sharp
,
and
to
the
point
;
in
form
rather
a
business
-
like
letter
for
a
woman
to
write
 
in
substance
as
plain
a
confirmation
as
could
be
desire
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
statement
.
<EOS>
this
be
my
opinion
,
and
with
certain
minor
reservation
,
Miss
Halcombe
's
opinion
also
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
,
when
the
letter
be
show
to
him
,
do
not
appear
to
be
strike
by
the
sharp
,
short
tone
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
that
Mrs.
Catherick
be
a
woman
of
few
word
,
a
clear
-
headed
,
straightforward
,
unimaginative
person
,
who
write
briefly
and
plainly
,
just
as
she
speak
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
duty
to
be
accomplish
,
now
that
the
answer
have
be
receive
,
be
to
acquaint
Miss
Fairlie
with
Sir
Percival
's
explanation
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
have
undertake
to
do
this
,
and
have
leave
the
room
to
go
to
her
sister
,
when
she
suddenly
return
again
,
and
sit
down
by
the
easy
-
chair
in
which
I
be
read
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
go
out
a
minute
before
to
look
at
the
stable
,
and
no
one
be
in
the
room
but
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
we
have
really
and
truly
do
all
we
can
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
turn
and
twist
Mrs.
Catherick
's
letter
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
we
be
friend
of
Sir
Percival
's
,
who
know
him
and
trust
him
,
we
have
do
all
,
and
more
than
all
,
that
be
necessary
,
"
I
answer
,
a
little
annoy
by
this
return
of
her
hesitation
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
we
be
enemy
who
suspect
him
 
"
  
"
that
alternative
be
not
even
to
be
think
of
,
"
she
interpose
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
Sir
Percival
's
friend
,
and
if
generosity
and
forbearance
can
add
to
our
regard
for
him
,
we
ought
to
be
Sir
Percival
's
admirer
as
well
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
he
see
Mr.
Fairlie
yesterday
,
and
that
he
afterwards
go
out
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
ride
away
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
begin
the
ride
by
talk
about
Anne
Catherick
,
and
about
the
singular
manner
in
which
Mr.
Hartright
meet
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
we
soon
drop
that
subject
,
and
Sir
Percival
speak
next
,
in
the
most
unselfish
term
,
of
his
engagement
with
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
observe
that
she
be
out
of
spirit
,
and
he
be
willing
,
if
not
informed
to
the
contrary
,
to
attribute
to
that
cause
the
alteration
in
her
manner
towards
him
during
his
present
visit
.
<EOS>
if
,
however
,
there
be
any
more
serious
reason
for
the
change
,
he
would
entreat
that
no
constraint
may
be
place
on
her
inclination
either
by
Mr.
Fairlie
or
by
me
.
<EOS>
all
he
ask
,
in
that
case
,
be
that
she
would
recall
to
mind
,
for
the
last
time
,
what
the
circumstance
be
under
which
the
engagement
between
them
be
make
,
and
what
his
conduct
have
be
from
the
beginning
of
the
courtship
to
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
if
,
after
due
reflection
on
those
two
subject
,
she
seriously
desire
that
he
should
withdraw
his
pretension
to
the
honour
of
become
her
husband
 
<EOS>
and
if
she
would
tell
him
so
plainly
with
her
own
lip
 
he
would
sacrifice
himself
by
leave
her
perfectly
free
to
withdraw
from
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
man
could
say
more
than
that
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
as
to
my
experience
,
few
man
in
his
situation
would
have
say
as
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
after
I
have
speak
those
word
,
and
look
at
me
with
a
singular
expression
of
perplexity
and
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
accuse
nobody
,
and
I
suspect
nothing
,
"
she
break
out
abruptly
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
and
will
not
accept
the
responsibility
of
persuade
Laura
to
this
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
exactly
the
course
<EOS>
which
Sir
Percival
Glyde
have
himself
request
you
to
take
,
"
I
reply
in
astonishment
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
beg
you
not
to
force
her
inclination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
indirectly
oblige
me
to
force
them
,
if
I
give
her
his
message
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
that
possibly
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
consult
your
own
knowledge
of
Laura
,
Mr.
Gilmore
.
<EOS>
if
I
tell
her
to
reflect
on
the
circumstance
of
her
engagement
,
I
at
once
appeal
to
two
of
the
strong
feeling
in
her
nature
 
to
her
love
for
her
father
's
memory
,
and
to
her
strict
regard
for
truth
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
she
never
break
a
promise
in
her
life
 
<EOS>
you
know
that
she
enter
on
this
engagement
at
the
beginning
of
her
father
's
fatal
illness
,
and
that
he
speak
hopefully
and
happily
of
her
marriage
to
Sir
Percival
Glyde
on
his
deathbed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
own
that
I
be
a
little
shocked
at
this
view
of
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
surely
,
"
I
say
,
"
you
do
not
mean
to
infer
that
when
Sir
Percival
speak
to
you
yesterday
he
speculate
on
such
a
result
as
you
have
just
mention
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
frank
,
fearless
face
answer
for
her
before
she
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
I
would
remain
an
instant
in
the
company
of
any
man
whom
I
suspect
of
such
baseness
as
that
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
I
like
to
feel
her
hearty
indignation
flash
out
on
me
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
We
see
so
much
malice
and
so
little
indignation
in
my
profession
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
that
case
,
"
I
say
,
"
excuse
me
if
I
tell
you
,
in
our
legal
phrase
,
that
you
be
travel
out
of
the
record
.
<EOS>
whatever
the
consequence
may
be
,
Sir
Percival
have
a
right
to
expect
that
your
sister
should
carefully
consider
her
engagement
from
every
reasonable
point
of
view
before
she
claim
her
release
from
it
.
<EOS>
if
that
unlucky
letter
have
prejudice
her
against
him
,
go
at
once
,
and
tell
her
that
he
have
clear
himself
in
your
eye
and
in
mine
.
<EOS>
what
objection
can
she
urge
against
him
after
that
?
<EOS>
what
excuse
can
she
possibly
have
for
change
her
mind
about
a
man
whom
she
have
virtually
accept
for
her
husband
more
than
two
year
ago
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
eye
of
law
and
reason
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
no
excuse
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
if
she
still
hesitate
,
and
if
I
still
hesitate
,
you
must
attribute
our
strange
conduct
,
if
you
like
,
to
caprice
in
both
case
,
and
we
must
bear
the
imputation
as
well
as
we
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
those
word
she
suddenly
rise
and
leave
me
.
<EOS>
when
a
sensible
woman
have
a
serious
question
put
to
her
,
and
evade
it
by
a
flippant
answer
,
it
be
a
sure
sign
,
in
ninety
-
nine
case
out
of
a
hundred
,
that
she
have
something
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
I
return
to
the
perusal
of
the
newspaper
,
strongly
suspect
that
Miss
Halcombe
and
Miss
Fairlie
have
a
secret
between
them
which
they
be
keep
from
Sir
Percival
,
and
keep
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
this
hard
on
both
of
us
,
especially
on
Sir
Percival
.
  
<EOS>
My
doubt
 
or
to
speak
more
correctly
,
my
conviction
 
be
confirm
by
Miss
Halcombe
's
language
and
manner
when
I
see
her
again
later
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
She
be
suspiciously
brief
and
reserve
in
tell
me
the
result
of
her
interview
with
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
,
it
appear
,
have
listen
quietly
while
the
affair
of
the
letter
be
place
before
her
in
the
right
point
of
view
,
but
when
Miss
Halcombe
next
proceed
to
say
that
the
object
of
Sir
Percival
's
visit
at
Limmeridge
be
to
prevail
on
her
to
let
a
day
be
fix
for
the
marriage
she
check
all
further
reference
to
the
subject
by
beg
for
time
.
<EOS>
if
Sir
Percival
would
consent
to
spare
her
for
the
present
,
she
would
undertake
to
give
him
his
final
answer
before
the
end
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
She
plead
for
this
delay
with
such
anxiety
and
agitation
,
that
Miss
Halcombe
have
promise
to
use
her
influence
,
if
necessary
,
to
obtain
it
,
and
there
,
at
Miss
Fairlie
's
earnest
entreaty
,
all
further
discussion
of
the
marriage
question
have
end
.
  
<EOS>
the
purely
temporary
arrangement
thus
propose
may
have
be
convenient
enough
to
the
young
lady
,
but
it
prove
somewhat
embarrassing
to
the
writer
of
these
line
.
<EOS>
that
morning
's
post
have
bring
a
letter
from
my
partner
,
which
oblige
me
to
return
to
town
the
next
day
by
the
afternoon
train
.
<EOS>
It
be
extremely
probable
that
I
should
find
no
second
opportunity
of
present
myself
at
Limmeridge
House
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
suppose
Miss
Fairlie
ultimately
decide
on
hold
to
her
engagement
,
my
necessary
personal
communication
with
her
,
before
I
draw
her
settlement
,
would
become
something
like
a
downright
impossibility
,
and
we
should
be
oblige
to
commit
to
writing
question
which
ought
always
to
be
discuss
on
both
side
by
word
of
mouth
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
about
this
difficulty
until
Sir
Percival
have
be
consult
on
the
subject
of
the
desire
delay
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
gallant
a
gentleman
not
to
grant
the
request
immediately
.
<EOS>
when
Miss
Halcombe
inform
me
of
this
I
tell
her
that
I
must
absolutely
speak
to
her
sister
before
I
leave
Limmeridge
,
and
it
be
,
therefore
,
<EOS>
arrange
that
I
should
see
Miss
Fairlie
in
her
own
sitting
-
room
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
come
down
to
dinner
,
or
join
us
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
indisposition
be
the
excuse
,
and
I
think
Sir
Percival
look
,
as
well
he
may
,
a
little
annoyed
when
he
hear
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
as
soon
as
breakfast
be
over
,
I
go
up
to
Miss
Fairlie
's
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
look
so
pale
and
sad
,
and
come
forward
to
welcome
me
so
readily
and
prettily
,
that
the
resolution
to
lecture
her
on
her
caprice
and
indecision
,
which
I
have
be
form
all
the
way
upstairs
,
fail
me
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
lead
her
back
to
the
chair
from
which
she
have
rise
,
and
place
myself
opposite
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
cross
-
grain
pet
greyhound
be
in
the
room
,
and
I
fully
expect
a
barking
and
snapping
reception
.
<EOS>
strange
to
say
,
the
whimsical
little
brute
falsify
my
expectation
by
jump
into
my
lap
and
poke
its
sharp
muzzle
familiarly
into
my
hand
the
moment
I
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
use
often
to
sit
on
my
knee
when
you
be
a
child
,
my
dear
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
now
your
little
dog
seem
determined
to
succeed
you
in
the
vacant
throne
.
<EOS>
be
that
pretty
draw
your
doing
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
point
to
a
little
album
which
lie
on
the
table
by
her
side
and
which
she
have
evidently
be
look
over
when
I
come
in
.
<EOS>
the
page
that
lie
open
have
a
small
water
-
colour
landscape
very
neatly
mount
on
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
drawing
which
have
suggest
my
question
 
<EOS>
an
idle
question
enough
 
<EOS>
but
how
could
I
begin
to
talk
of
business
to
her
the
moment
I
open
my
lip
?
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
she
say
,
look
away
from
the
drawing
rather
confusedly
,
"
it
be
not
my
doing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
finger
have
a
restless
habit
,
which
I
remember
in
her
as
a
child
,
of
always
play
with
the
first
thing
that
come
to
hand
whenever
any
one
be
talk
to
her
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
they
wander
to
the
album
,
and
toy
absently
about
the
margin
of
the
little
water
-
colour
drawing
.
<EOS>
the
expression
of
melancholy
deepen
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
look
at
the
drawing
,
or
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
move
uneasily
from
object
to
object
in
the
room
,
betray
plainly
that
she
suspect
what
my
purpose
be
in
come
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
see
that
,
I
think
it
best
to
get
to
the
purpose
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
of
the
errand
,
my
dear
,
which
bring
me
here
be
to
bid
you
good
-
bye
,
"
I
begin
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
get
back
to
London
to
-
day
:
and
,
before
I
leave
,
I
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
on
the
subject
of
your
own
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
you
be
go
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
"
she
say
,
look
at
me
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
like
the
happy
old
time
to
have
you
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
may
be
able
to
come
back
and
recall
those
pleasant
memory
once
more
,
"
I
continue
;
"
but
as
there
be
some
uncertainty
about
the
future
,
I
must
take
my
opportunity
when
I
can
get
it
,
and
speak
to
you
now
.
<EOS>
I
be
your
old
lawyer
and
your
old
friend
,
and
I
may
remind
you
,
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
without
offence
,
of
the
possibility
of
your
marry
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.

"
  
<EOS>
She
take
her
hand
off
the
little
album
as
suddenly
as
if
it
have
turn
hot
and
burn
her
.
<EOS>
Her
finger
twine
together
nervously
in
her
lap
,
her
eye
look
down
again
at
the
floor
,
and
an
expression
of
constraint
settle
on
her
face
which
look
almost
like
an
expression
of
pain
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
absolutely
necessary
to
speak
of
my
marriage
engagement
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
in
low
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
necessary
to
refer
to
it
,
"
I
answer
,
"
but
not
to
dwell
on
it
.
<EOS>
let
us
merely
say
that
you
may
marry
,
or
that
you
may
not
marry
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
case
,
I
must
be
prepare
,
beforehand
,
to
draw
your
settlement
,
and
I
ought
not
to
do
that
without
,
as
a
matter
of
politeness
,
first
consult
you
.
<EOS>
this
may
be
my
only
chance
of
hear
what
your
wish
be
.
<EOS>
let
us
,
therefore
,
suppose
the
case
of
your
marrying
,
and
let
me
inform
you
,
in
as
few
word
as
possible
,
what
your
position
be
now
,
and
what
you
may
make
it
,
if
you
please
,
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
explain
to
her
the
object
of
a
marriage
-
settlement
,
and
then
tell
her
exactly
what
her
prospect
be
 
in
the
first
place
,
on
her
coming
of
age
,
and
in
the
second
place
,
on
the
decease
of
her
uncle
 
mark
the
distinction
between
the
property
in
which
she
have
a
life
-
interest
only
,
and
the
property
which
be
leave
at
her
own
control
.
<EOS>
She
listen
attentively
,
with
the
constrained
expression
still
on
her
face
,
and
her
hand
still
nervously
clasp
together
in
her
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
"
I
say
in
conclusion
,
"
tell
me
if
you
can
think
of
any
condition

the
case
we
have

of
course

your
guardian
's
approval

you
be
not
yet
of
age

<EOS>
She
move
uneasily
in
her
chair
,
then
look
in
my
face
on
a
sudden
very
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
do
happen
,

she
begin
faintly
,
"
if
I
be

you
be
married

I
add
,
help
her
out

<EOS>
"
do
not

him
part
me
from
Marian

she
cry
,
with
a
sudden
outbreak
of
energy
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
pray
make
it
law
that
Marian
be
to
live
with
me
!

<EOS>
under
other
circumstance
I
may
,
perhaps
,
have
be
amuse
at
this
essentially
feminine
interpretation
of
my
question
,
and
of
the
long
explanation
which
have
precede
it
.
<EOS>
but
her
look
and
tone
,
when
she
speak
,
be
of
a
kind
to
make
me
more
than
serious
 
<EOS>
they
distress
me
.
<EOS>
Her
word
,
few
as
they
be
,
betray
a
desperate
cling
to
the
past
which
bode
ill
for
the
future

Your
have
Marian
Halcombe

easily

settle

private
arrangement

I
say

You
hardly
understand
my
question

think

It
refer
to
your
own
property
 
to
the
disposal
of
your
money

suppose
you
be
to
make
a

you

remember
what

large
sum
it

you
like
it
all

go
to

Halcombe

She
hesitate

her
colour
come
and
go

her
hand
steal
back
again
to
the
little
album

not
all

some
one
else

She
stop
;
her
colour
heighten
,
and
the
finger
of
the
hand
that
rest
upon
the
album
beat
gently
on
the
margin
of
the

as
if
her
memory
have
set
them
go
mechanically
with
the
remembrance
of
a
favourite
tune
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
some
other
member
of
the
family
besides
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
I
suggest
,
see
her
at
a
loss
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
the
heighten
colour
spread
to
her
forehead
and
her
neck
,
and
the
nervous
finger
suddenly
clasp
themselves
fast
round
the
edge
of
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
some
one
else
,
"
she
say
,
not
notice
my
last
word
,
though
she
have
evidently
hear
them
;
"
there
be
some
one
else
who
may
like
a
little

<EOS>
if
 
if
I
may
leave
it

<EOS>
there
would
be
no
harm
if
I
should
die
first
 
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
again
.
<EOS>
the
colour
that
have
spread
over
her
cheek
suddenly
,
as
suddenly
leave
them
.
<EOS>
the
hand
on
the
album
resign
its
hold
,
tremble
a
little
,
and
move
the
book
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
me
for
an
instant
 
then
turn
her
head
aside
in
the
chair
.
<EOS>
Her
handkerchief
fall
to
the
floor
as
she
change
her
position
,
and
she
hurriedly
hide
her
face
from
me
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Sad
!
<EOS>
to
remember
her
,
as
I
do
,
the
lively
,
happy
child
that
ever
laugh
the
day
through
,
and
to
see
her
now
,
in
the
flower
of
her
age
and
her
beauty
,
so
broken
and
so
bring
down
as
this
!
  
<EOS>
in
the
distress
that
she
cause
me
I
forget
the
year
that
have
pass
,
and
the
change
they
have
make
in
our
position
towards
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
move
my
chair
close
to
her
,
and
pick
up
her
handkerchief
from
the
carpet
,
and
draw
her
hand
from
her
face
gently
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
cry
,
my
love
,
"
I
say
,
and
dry
the
tear
that
be
gather
in
her
eye
with
my
own
hand
,
as
if
she
have
be
the
little
Laura
Fairlie
of
ten
long
year
ago
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
good
way
I
could
have
take
to
compose
her
.
<EOS>
She
lay
her
head
on
my
shoulder
,
and
smile
faintly
through
her
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
for
forget
myself
,
"
she
say
artlessly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
be
well
 
I
have
feel
sadly
weak
and
nervous
lately
,
and
I
often
cry
without
reason
when
I
be
alone
.
<EOS>
I
be
better
now
 
<EOS>
I
can
answer
you
as
I
ought

Mr.
Gilmore

I
can

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

my

I
reply
,
"
we
will
consider
the

<EOS>
You
have
say
enough
to
sanction
my
take
the
good

we
can
settle
detail
at
another
opportunity

<EOS>
let
us
have
do
with
business
now
,
and
talk
of
something
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
lead
her
at
once
into
speak
on
other
topic
.
<EOS>
in
ten
minute
'
time
she
be
in
well
spirit
,
and
I
rise
to
take
my
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
here
again
,
"
she
say
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
be
worthy
of
your
kind
feeling
for
me
and
for
my
interest
if
you
will
only
come
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
still
cling
to
the
past
 
that
past
which
I
represent
to
her
,
in
my
way
,
as
Miss
Halcombe
do
in
her
!
<EOS>
It
trouble
me
sorely
to
see
her
look
back
,
at
the
beginning
of
her
career
,
just
as
I
look
back
at
the
end
of
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
do
come
again
,
I
hope
I
shall
find
you
well
,
"
I
say
;
"
well
and
happy

<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
my
dear

"
  
<EOS>
She
only
answer
by
put
up
her
cheek
to
me
to
be
kiss
.
<EOS>
even
lawyer
have
heart
,
and
mine
ache
a
little
as
I
take
leave
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
interview
between
us
have
hardly
last
more
than
half
an
hour
 
<EOS>
she
have
not
breathe
a
word
,
in
my
presence
,
to
explain
the
mystery
of
her
evident
distress
and
dismay
at
the
prospect
of
her
marriage
,
and
yet
she
have
contrive
to
win
me
over
to
her
side
of
the
question
<EOS>
,
I
neither
know
how
nor
why
.
<EOS>
I
have
enter
the
room
,
feel
that
Sir
Percival
Glyde
have
fair
reason
to
complain
of
the
manner
in
which
she
be
treat
him
.
<EOS>
I
leave
it
,
secretly
hope
that
matter
may
end
in
her
take
him
at
his
word
and
claim
her
release
.
<EOS>
a
man
of
my
age
and
experience
ought
to
have
know
better
than
to
vacillate
in
this
unreasonable
manner
.
<EOS>
I
can
make
no
excuse
for
myself
;
I
can
only
tell
the
truth
,
and
say
 
so
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
hour
for
my
departure
be
now
draw
near
.
<EOS>
I
send
to
Mr.
Fairlie
to
say
that
I
would
wait
on
him
to
take
leave
if
he
like
,
but
that
he
must
excuse
my
being
rather
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
He
send
a
message
back
,
write
in
pencil
on
a
slip
of
paper
:
"
kind
love
and
good

good

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
just
before
I
leave
I
see
Miss
Halcombe
for
a
moment
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
say
all

"
<EOS>
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"

I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
She

nervous
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad

you
to
take

"
  
<EOS>
Miss

sharp
eye
study
my
face
attentively

<EOS>
"
You

she
say
.
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
  
no

<EOS>
I
only
answer
    
"

me
know
what

<EOS>
I
will
do
nothing
till
I
hear
from
you

"
  
<EOS>
She
still
look
hard
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
be
all
over
,
and
well
over

Mr.
Gilmore

"
<EOS>
with
those
word
she
leave
me
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
most
politely
insist
on
see
me
to
the
carriage
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
if

"
he
say
,
"
pray
do
not

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
a
really
irresistible
man
 
courteous
,
considerate
,
delightfully
free
from
pride
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
,
every
inch
of
him
.
<EOS>
as
I
drive
away
to
the
station
I
feel
as
if
I
could
cheerfully
do
anything
to
promote
the
interest
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
 
anything
in
the
world
,
except
draw
the
marriage
settlement
of
his
wife
.
    
<EOS>
a
week
pass
,
after
my
return
to
London
,
without
the
receipt
of
any
communication
from
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
eighth
day
a
letter
in
her
handwriting
be
place
among
the
other
letter
on
my
table
.
  
<EOS>
It
announce
that
Sir
Percival
Glyde
have
be
definitely
accept
,
and
that
the
marriage
be
to
take
place
,
as
he
have
originally
desire
,
before
the
end
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
the
ceremony
would
be
perform
during
the
last
fortnight
in
December
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
's
twenty
-
first
birthday
be
late
in
March
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
therefore
,
by
this
arrangement
,
become
Sir
Percival
's
wife
about
three
month
before
she
be
of
age
.
  
<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
have
be
surprise
,
I
ought
not
to
have
be
sorry
,
but
I
be
surprised
and
sorry
,
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
some
little
disappointment
,
cause
by
the
unsatisfactory
shortness
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
letter
,
mingle
itself
with
these
feeling
,
and
contribute
its
share
towards
upset
my
serenity
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
in
six
line
my
correspondent
announce
the
propose
marriage
 
in
three
more
,
she
tell
me
that
Sir
Percival
have
leave
Cumberland
to
return
to
his
house
in
Hampshire
,
and
in
two
conclude
sentence
she
inform
me
,
first
,
that
Laura
be
sadly
in
want
of
change
and
cheerful
society
;
secondly
,
that
she
have
resolve
to
try
the
effect
of
some
such
change
forthwith
,
by
take
her
sister
away
with
her
on
a
visit
to
certain
old
friend
in
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
there
the
letter
end
,
without
a
word
to
explain
what
the
circumstance
be
which
have
decide
Miss
Fairlie
to
accept
Sir
Percival
Glyde
in
one
short
week
from
the
time
when
I
have
last
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
at
a
later
period
the
cause
of
this
sudden
determination
be
fully
explain
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
business
to
relate
it
imperfectly
,
on
hearsay
evidence
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
come
within
the
personal
experience
of
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
when
her
narrative
succeed
mine
,
she
will
describe
them
in
every
particular
exactly
as
they
happen
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
the
plain
duty
for
me
to
perform
 
before
I
,
in
my
turn
,
lie
down
my
pen
and
withdraw
from
the
story
 
be
to
relate
the
one
remain
event
connect
with
Miss
Fairlie
's
propose
marriage
in
which
I
be
concern
,
namely
,
the
drawing
of
the
settlement
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
refer
intelligibly
to
this
document
without
first
enter
into
certain
particular
in
relation
to
the
bride
's
pecuniary
affair
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
make
my
explanation
briefly
and
plainly
,
and
to
keep
it
free
from
professional
obscurity
and
technicality
.
<EOS>
the
matter
be
of
the
utmost
importance
.
<EOS>
I
warn
all
reader
of
these
line
that
Miss
Fairlie
's
inheritance
be
a
very
serious
part
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
story
,
and
that
Mr.
Gilmore
's
experience
,
in
this
particular
,
must
be
their
experience
also
,
if
they
wish
to
understand
the
narrative
which
be
yet
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
's
expectation
,
then
,
be
of
a
twofold
kind
,
comprise
her
possible
inheritance
of
real
property
,
or
land
,
when
her
uncle
die
,
and
her
absolute
inheritance
of
personal
property
,
or
money
,
when
she
come
of
age
.
  
<EOS>
let
us
take
the
land
first
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
time
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
paternal
grandfather
(
whom
we
will
call
Mr.
Fairlie
,
the
elder
)
the
entail
succession
to
the
Limmeridge
estate
stand
thus
    
Mr.
Fairlie
,
the
elder
,
die
and
leave
three
son
,
Philip
,
Frederick
,
and
Arthur
.
<EOS>
as
eld
son
,
Philip
succeed
to
the
estate
,
if
he
die
without
leave
a
son
,
the
property
go
to
the
second
brother
,
Frederick
;
and
if
Frederick
die
also
without
leave
a
son
,
the
property
go
to
the
third
brother
,
Arthur
.
  
<EOS>
as
event
turn
out
,
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
die
leave
an
only
daughter
,
the
Laura
of
this
story
,
and
the
estate
,
in
consequence
,
go
,
in
course
of
law
,
to
the
second
brother
,
Frederick
,
a
single
man
.
<EOS>
the
third
brother
,
Arthur
,
have
die
many
year
before
the
decease
of
Philip
,
leave
a
son
and
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
son
,
at
the
age
of
eighteen
,
be
drown
at
Oxford
.
<EOS>
His
death
leave
Laura
,
the
daughter
of
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
,
presumptive
heiress
to
the
estate
,
with
every
chance
of
succeed
to
it
,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
,
on
her
uncle
Frederick
's
death
,
if
the
say
Frederick
die
without
leave
male
issue
.
  
<EOS>
except
in
the
event
,
then
,
of
Mr.
Frederick
Fairlie
's
marrying
and
leave
an
heir
(
the
two
very
last
thing
in
the
world
that
he
be
likely
to
do
)
,
his
niece
,
Laura
,
would
have
the
property
on
his
death
,
possess
,
it
must
be
remember
,
nothing
more
than
a
life
-
interest
in
it
.
<EOS>
if
she
die
single
,
or
die
childless
,
the
estate
would
revert
to
her
cousin
,
Magdalen
,
the
daughter
of
Mr.
Arthur
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
if
she
marry
,
with
a
proper
settlement
 
or
,
in
other
word
,
with
the
settlement
I
mean
to
make
for
her
 
the
income
from
the
estate
(
a
good
three
thousand
a
year
)
would
,
during
her
lifetime
,
be
at
her
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
if
she
die
before
her
husband
,
he
would
naturally
expect
to
be
leave
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
income
,
for
his
lifetime
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
a
son
,
that
son
would
be
the
heir
,
to
the
exclusion
of
her
cousin
Magdalen
.
<EOS>
thus
,
Sir
Percival
's
prospect
in
marry
Miss
Fairlie
(
so
far
as
his
wife
's
expectation
from
real
property
be
concern
)
promise
him
these
two
advantage
,
on
Mr.
Frederick
Fairlie
's
death
:
<EOS>
first
,
the
use
of
three
thousand
a
year
(
by
his
wife
's
permission
,
while
she
live
,
and
in
his
own
right
,
on
her
death
,
if
he
survive
her
)
;
and
,
secondly
,
the
inheritance
of
Limmeridge
for
his
son
,
if
he
have
one
.
  
<EOS>
so
much
for
the
landed
property
,
and
for
the
disposal
of
the
income
from
it
,
on
the
occasion
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
thus
far
,
no
difficulty
or
difference
of
opinion
on
the
lady
's
settlement
be
at
all
likely
to
arise
between
Sir
Percival
's
lawyer
and
myself
.
  
<EOS>
the
personal
estate
,
or
,
in
other
word
,
the
money
to
which
Miss
Fairlie
would
become
entitled
on
reach
the
age
of
twenty
-
one
year
,
be
the
next
point
to
consider
.
  
<EOS>
this
part
of
her
inheritance
be
,
in
itself
,
a
comfortable
little
fortune
.
<EOS>
It
be
derive
under
her
father
's
will
,
and
it
amount
to
the
sum
of
twenty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
besides
this
,
she
have
a
life
-
interest
in
ten
thousand
pound
more
,
which
latter
amount
be
to
go
,
on
her
decease
,
to
her
aunt
Eleanor
,
her
father
's
only
sister
.
<EOS>
It
will
greatly
assist
in
set
the
family
affair
before
the
reader
in
the
clear
possible
light
,
if
I
stop
here
for
a
moment
,
to
explain
why
the
aunt
have
be
keep
wait
for
her
legacy
until
the
death
of
the
niece
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
have
live
on
excellent
term
with
his
sister
Eleanor
,
as
long
as
she
remain
a
single
woman
.
<EOS>
but
when
her
marriage
take
place
,
somewhat
late
in
life
,
and
when
that
marriage
unite
her
to
an
italian
gentleman
name
Fosco
,
or
,
rather
,
to
an
italian
nobleman
 
see
that
he
rejoice
in
the
title
of
Count
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
disapprove
of
her
conduct
so
strongly
that
he
cease
to
hold
any
communication
with
her
,
and
even
go
the
length
of
strike
her
name
out
of
his
will
.
<EOS>
the
other
member
of
the
family
all
think
this
serious
manifestation
of
resentment
at
his
sister
's
marriage
more
or
less
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
Count
Fosco
,
though
not
a
rich
man
,
be
not
a
penniless
adventurer
either
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
small
but
sufficient
income
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
have
live
many
year
in
England
,
and
he
hold
an
excellent
position
in
society
.
<EOS>
these
recommendation
,
however
,
avail
nothing
with
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
in
many
of
his
opinion
he
be
an
Englishman
of
the
old
school
,
and
he
hate
a
foreigner
simply
and
solely
because
he
be
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
the
utmost
that
he
could
be
prevail
on
to
do
,
in
after
year
 
mainly
at
Miss
Fairlie
's
intercession
 
be
to
restore
his
sister
's
name
to
its
former
place
in
his
will
,
but
to
keep
her
wait
for
her
legacy
by
give
the
income
of
the
money
to
his
daughter
for
life
,
and
the
money
itself
,
if
her
aunt
die
before
her
,
to
her
cousin
Magdalen
.
<EOS>
consider
the
relative
age
of
the
two
lady
,
the
aunt
's
chance
,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
,
of
receive
the
ten
thousand
pound
,
be
thus
render
doubtful
in
the
extreme
;
and
Madame
Fosco
resent
her
brother
's
treatment
of
her
as
unjustly
as
usual
in
such
case
,
by
refuse
to
see
her
niece
,
and
decline
to
believe
that
Miss
Fairlie
's
intercession
have
ever
be
exert
to
restore
her
name
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
will
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
history
of
the
ten
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
here
again
no
difficulty
could
arise
with
Sir
Percival
's
legal
adviser
.
<EOS>
the
income
would
be
at
the
wife
's
disposal
,
and
the
principal
would
go
to
her
aunt
or
her
cousin
on
her
death
.
  
<EOS>
all
preliminary
explanation
be
now
clear
out
of
the
way
,
I
come
at
last
to
the
real
knot
of
the
case
 
to
the
twenty
thousand
pound
.
  
<EOS>
this
sum
be
absolutely
Miss
Fairlie
's
own
on
her
complete
her
twenty
-
first
year
,
and
the
whole
future
disposition
of
it
depend
,
in
the
first
instance
,
on
the
condition
I
could
obtain
for
her
in
her
marriage
-
settlement
.
<EOS>
the
other
clause
contain
in
that
document
be
of
a
formal
kind
,
and
nee
not
be
recite
here
.
<EOS>
but
the
clause
relate
to
the
money
be
too
important
to
be
pass
over
.
<EOS>
a
few
line
will
be
sufficient
to
give
the
necessary
abstract
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
stipulation
in
regard
to
the
twenty
thousand
pound
be
simply
this
:
the
whole
amount
be
to
be
settle
so
as
to
give
the
income
to
the
lady
for
her
life
 
afterwards
to
Sir
Percival
for
his
life
 
and
the
principal
to
the
child
of
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
in
default
of
issue
,
the
principal
be
to
be
dispose
of
as
the
lady
may
by
her
will
direct
,
for
which
purpose
I
reserve
to
her
the
right
of
make
a
will
.
<EOS>
the
effect
of
these
condition
may
be
thus
sum
up
.
<EOS>
if
Lady
Glyde
die
without
leave
child
,
her
half
-
sister
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
any
other
relative
or
friend
whom
she
may
be
anxious
to
benefit
,
would
,
on
her
husband
's
death
,
divide
among
them
such
share
of
her
money
as
she
desire
them
to
have
.
<EOS>
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
she
die
leave
child
,
then
their
interest
,
naturally
and
necessarily
,
supersede
all
other
interest
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
clause
 
and
<EOS>
no
one
who
read
it
can
fail
,
I
think
,
to
agree
with
me
that
it
mete
out
equal
justice
to
all
party
.
  
<EOS>
We
shall
see
how
my
proposal
be
meet
on
the
husband
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
time
when
Miss
Halcombe
's
letter
reach
me
<EOS>
I
be
even
more
busily
occupy
than
usual
.
<EOS>
but
I
contrive
to
make
leisure
for
the
settlement
.
<EOS>
I
have
draw
it
,
and
have
send
it
for
approval
to
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
,
in
less
than
a
week
from
the
time
when
Miss
Halcombe
have
inform
me
of
the
propose
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
lapse
of
two
day
the
document
be
return
to
me
,
with
note
and
remark
of
the
baronet
's
lawyer
.
<EOS>
His
objection
,
in
general
,
prove
to
be
of
the
most
trifling
and
technical
kind
,
until
he
come
to
the
clause
relate
to
the
twenty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
against
this
there
be
double
line
draw
in
red
ink
,
and
the
follow
note
be
append
to
them
    
"
not
admissible
.
<EOS>
the
principal
to
go
to
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
in
the
event
of
his
survive
Lady
Glyde
,
and
there
be
no
issue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
not
one
farthing
of
the
twenty
thousand
pound
be
to
go
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
or
to
any
other
relative
or
friend
of
Lady
Glyde
's
.
<EOS>
the
whole
sum
,
if
she
leave
no
child
,
be
to
slip
into
the
pocket
of
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
the
answer
I
write
to
this
audacious
proposal
be
as
short
and
sharp
as
I
could
make
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
's
settlement
.
<EOS>
I

the
clause

which
you

rejoinder

quarter

hour

<EOS>
My
dear
sir
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
's
settlement
.
<EOS>
I
maintain
the
red
ink
to
which
you
object
,
exactly
as
it
stand
.
<EOS>
Yours
truly
.
<EOS>
"
in
the
detestable
slang
of
the
day
,
we
be
now
both
"
at
a
deadlock
,
"
and
nothing
be
leave
for
it
but
to
refer
to
our
client
on
either
side
.
  
<EOS>
as
matter
stand
,
my
client
 
Miss
Fairlie
not
have
yet
complete
her
twenty
-
first
year
 
Mr.
Frederick
Fairlie
,
be
her
guardian
.
<EOS>
I
write
by
that
day
's
post
,
and
put
the
case
before
him
exactly
as
it
stand
,
not
only
urge
every
argument
I
could
think
of
to
induce
him
to
maintain
the
clause
as
I
have
draw
it
,
but
state
to
him
plainly
the
mercenary
motive
which
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
opposition
to
my
settlement
of
the
twenty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
the
knowledge
of
Sir
Percival
's
affair
which
I
have
necessarily
gain
when
the
provision
of
the
deed
on
his
side
be
submit
in
due
course
to
my
examination
,
have
but
too
plainly
inform
me
that
the
debt
on
his
estate
be
enormous
,
and
that
his
income
,
though
nominally
a
large
one
,
be
virtually
,
for
a
man
in
his
position
,
next
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
want
of
ready
money
be
the
practical
necessity
of
Sir
Percival
's
existence
,
and
his
lawyer
's
note
on
the
clause
in
the
settlement
be
nothing
but
the
frankly
selfish
expression
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
's
answer
reach
me
by
return
of
post
,
and
prove
to
be
wander
and
irrelevant
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
turn
into
plain
English
,
it
practically
express
itself
to
this
effect
:
"
Would
dear
Gilmore
be
so
very
obliging
as
not
to
worry
his
friend
and
client
about
such
a
trifle
as
a
remote
contingency
?
<EOS>
be
it
likely
that
a
young
woman
of
twenty
-
one
would
die
before
a
man
of
forty
five
,
and
die
without
child
?
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
in
such
a
miserable
world
as
this
,
be
it
possible
to
over
-
estimate
the
value
of
peace
and
quietness
?
<EOS>
if
those
two
heavenly
blessing
be
offer
in
exchange
for
such
an
earthly
trifle
as
a
remote
chance
of
twenty
thousand
pound
,
be
it
not
a
fair
bargain
?
<EOS>
surely
,
yes
.
<EOS>
then
why
not
make
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
throw
the
letter
away
in
disgust
.
<EOS>
just
as
it
have
flutter
to
the
ground
,
there
be
a
knock
at
my
door
,
and
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
,
Mr.
Merriman
,
be
show
in
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
variety
of
sharp
practitioner
in
this
world
,
but
I
think
the
hard
of
all
to
deal
with
be
the
man
who
overreach
you
under
the
disguise
of
inveterate
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
a
fat
,
well
fed
,
smile
,
friendly
man
of
business
be
of
all
party
to
a
bargain
the
most
hopeless
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Merriman
be
one
of
this
class
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
how
be
good
Mr.
Gilmore
?
<EOS>
"
he
begin
,
all
in
a
glow
with
the
warmth
of
his
own
amiability

in
such
excellent
health

be
pass
your
door

I
think
I
would
look
in
in
case
you
may
have
something
to
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
do
 
now
pray
do
let
us
settle
this
little
difference
of
our
by
word
of
mouth
,
if
we
can

you

from

my

the
responsibility

off

obstinate

me

off

<EOS>
Merriman
,
I
leave
detail
to
you
.
<EOS>
do
what
you
think
right
for
my
interest
,
and
consider
me
as
have
personally
withdraw
from
the
business
until
it
be
all
over

<EOS>
"
those
be
Sir
Percival
's
word
a
fortnight
ago
,
and
all
I
can
get
him
to
do
now
be
to
repeat
them
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
hard
man

Mr.
Gilmore
,
as
you
know

<EOS>
personally

privately

I
do
assure
you

I
should
like
to
sponge
out

note

mine

if
Sir

will
not
go
into
the
matter

if
Sir

will
blindly
leave
all
his
interest
in
my
sole

what
course
can
I
possibly
take

the
course

assert
them

not

You

it

no

He
walk
to
the
fireplace

warm
himself

hum
the
fag
end

a
tune
in
a
rich
convivial
bass
voice

I

My

the
well

We

Our
somebody
be
a
man

We
have
get
him
close
under

here
in

we
strongly
suspect
he
have
something
to

Asylum

Sir
Percival
want
to
question
him
at
once

I
say
,
"
no

<EOS>
question
him
will
only
put
him
on
his
guard

watch

We

Mr.

He
smile
amiably

go
out

<EOS>
My
mind
have
be
rather
absent
during
the
latter
part
of
the
conversation
with
my
legal
friend
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
anxious
about
the
matter
of
the
settlement
that
I
have
little
attention
to
give
to
any
other
subject
,
and
the
moment
I
be
leave
alone
again
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
over
what
my
next
proceeding
ought
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
any
other
client
I
should
have
act
on
my
instruction
,
however
personally
distasteful
to
me
,
and
have
give
up
the
point
about
the
twenty
thousand
pound
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
act
with
this
business
-
like
indifference
towards
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
honest
feeling
of
affection
and
admiration
for
her
 
<EOS>
I
remember
gratefully
that
her
father
have
be
the
kind
patron
and
friend
to
me
that
ever
man
have
 
<EOS>
I
have
feel
towards
her
while
I
be
draw
the
settlement
as
I
may
have
feel
,
if
I
have
not
be
an
old
bachelor
,
towards
a
daughter
of
my
own
,
and
<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
spare
no
personal
sacrifice
in
her
service
and
where
her
interest
be
concern
.
<EOS>
write
a
second
time
to
Mr.
Fairlie
be
not
to
be
think
of
 
it
would
only
be
give
him
a
second
opportunity
of
slip
through
my
finger
.
<EOS>
see
him
and
personally
remonstrate
with
him
may
possibly
be
of
more
use
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
be
Saturday
.
<EOS>
I
determine
to
take
a
return
ticket
and
jolt
my
old
bone
down
to
Cumberland
,
on
the
chance
of
persuade
him
to
adopt
the
just
,
the
independent
,
and
the
honourable
course
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
poor
chance
enough
,
no
doubt
,
but
when
I
have
try
it
my
conscience
would
be
at
ease
.
<EOS>
I
should
then
have
do
all
that
a
man
in
my
position
could
do
to
serve
the
interest
of
my
old
friend
's
only
child
.
  
<EOS>
the
weather
on
Saturday
be
beautiful
,
a
west
wind
and
a
bright
sun
.
<EOS>
have
feel
latterly
a
return
of
that
fulness
and
oppression
of
the
head
,
against
which
my
doctor
warn
me
so
seriously
more
than
two
year
since
,
I
resolve
to
take
the
opportunity
of
get
a
little
extra
exercise
by
send
my
bag
on
before
me
and
walk
to
the
terminus
in
Euston
Square
.
<EOS>
as
I
come
out
into
Holborn
a
gentleman
walk
by
rapidly
stop
and
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mr.
Walter
Hartright
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
have
not
be
the
first
to
greet
me
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
have
pass
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
change
that
I
hardly
know
him
again
.
<EOS>
His
face
look
pale
and
haggard
 
<EOS>
his
manner
be
hurried
and
uncertain
 
and
<EOS>
his
dress
,
which
I
remember
as
neat
and
gentlemanlike
when
I
see
him
at
Limmeridge
,
be
so
slovenly
now
that
I
should
really
have
be
ashamed
of
the
appearance
of
it
on
one
of
my
own
clerk
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
be
long
back
from
Cumberland
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
from
Miss
Halcombe
lately

I
be
aware
that
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
explanation
have
be
consider
satisfactory

<EOS>
Will
the
marriage
take
place
soon
?
<EOS>
do
you
happen
to
know
Mr.
Gilmore
?

"
  
<EOS>
He
speak
so
fast
,
and
crowd
his
question
together
so
strangely
and
confusedly
,
that
I
could
hardly
follow
him
.
<EOS>
however
accidentally
intimate
he
may
have
be
with
the
family
at
Limmeridge
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
see
that
he
have
any
right
to
expect
information
on
their
private
affair
,
and
I
determine
to
drop
him
,
as
easily
as
may
be
,
on

subject

Miss
Fairlie
's
marriage

will
show

time
will

dare
say
if
we
look
out
for
the
marriage
in
the
paper
we
shall
not
be
far
wrong
.
<EOS>
excuse
my
notice
it
,

I
be
sorry
to
see
you
not
look
so
well
as
you
be
when
we
last
meet
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
momentary
nervous
contraction
quiver
about
his
lip
and
eye
,
and
make
me
half
reproach
myself
for
have
answer
him
in
such
a
significantly
guard
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
ask
about
her
marriage
,
"
he
say
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
wait
to
see
it
in
the
newspaper
like
other
people
.
<EOS>
yes
,
"
 
he
go
on
before
I
could
make
any
apology
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
be
well
lately
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
another
country
to
try
a
change
of
scene
and
occupation
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
have
kindly
assist
me
with
her
influence
,
and
my
testimonial
have
be
find
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
distance
off
,
but
I
do
not
care
where
I
go
,
what
the
climate
be
,
or
how
long
I
be
away
.
"
<EOS>
He
look
about
him
while
he
say
this
at
the
throng
of
stranger
pass
us
by
on
either
side
,
in
a
strange
,
suspicious
manner
,
as
if
he
think
that
some
of
them
may
be
watch
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
well
through
it
,
and
safe
back
again
,
"
I
say
,
and
then
add
,
<EOS>
so
as
not
to
keep
him
altogether
at
arm
's
length
on
the
subject
of
the
Fairlies
,
"
I
be
go
down
to
Limmeridge
to
-
day
on
business
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
and
Miss
Fairlie
be
away
just
now
on
a
visit
to
some
friend
in
Yorkshire
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
eye
brighten
,
and
he
seem
about
to
say
something
in
answer
,
but
the
same
momentary
nervous
spasm
cross
his
face
again
.
<EOS>
He
take
my
hand
,
press
it
hard
,
and
disappear
among
the
crowd
without
say
another
word
.
<EOS>
though
he
be
little
more
than
a
stranger
to
me
,
I
wait
for
a
moment
,
look
after
him
almost
with
a
feeling
of
regret
.
<EOS>
I
have
gain
in
my
profession
sufficient
experience
of
young
man
to
know
what
the
outward
sign
and
token
be
of
their
beginning
to
go
wrong
,
and
when
I
resume
my
walk
to
the
railway
I
be
sorry
to
say
I
feel
more
than
doubtful
about
Mr.
Hartright
's
future
.
    
<EOS>
leave
by
an
early
train
,
I
get
to
Limmeridge
in
time
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
oppressively
empty
and
dull
.
<EOS>
I
have
expect
that
good
Mrs.
Vesey
would
have
be
company
for
me
in
the
absence
of
the
young
lady
,
but
she
be
confine
to
her
room
by
a
cold
.
<EOS>
the
servant
be
so
surprised
at
see
me
that
they
hurry
and
bustle
absurdly
,
and
make
all
sort
of
annoying
mistake
.
<EOS>
even
the
butler
,
who
be
old
enough
to
have
know
better
,
bring
me
a
bottle
of
port
that
be
chill
.
<EOS>
the
report
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
health
be
just
as
usual
,
and
when
I
send
up
a
message
to
announce
my
arrival
,
I
be
tell
that
he
would
be
delighted
to
see
me
the
next
morning
but
that
the
sudden
news
of
my
appearance
have
prostrate
him
with
palpitation
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
the
wind
howl
dismally
all
night
,
and
strange
cracking
and
groaning
noise
sound
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
in
the
empty
house
.
<EOS>
I
sleep
as
wretchedly
as
possible
,
and
get
up
in
a
mighty
bad
humour
to
breakfast
by
myself
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
at
ten
o'clock
I
be
conduct
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
apartment
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
his
usual
room
,
his
usual
chair
,
and
his
usual
aggravating
state
of
mind
and
body
.
<EOS>
when
I
go
in
,
his
valet
be
stand
before
him
,
hold
up
for
inspection
a
heavy
volume
of
etching
,
as
long
and
as
broad
as
my
office
writing
-
desk
.
<EOS>
the
miserable
foreigner
grin
in
the
most
abject
manner
,
and
look
ready
to
drop
with
fatigue
,
while
his
master
composedly
turn
over
the
etching
,
and
bring
their
hide
beauty
to
light
with
the
help
of
a
magnify
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
very
good
of
good
old
friend
,
"
say
Mr.
Fairlie
,
lean
back
lazily
before
he
could
look
at
me
,
"
be
you
QUITE
<EOS>
well
?
<EOS>
how
nice
of
you
to
come
here
and
see
me
in
my
solitude
.
<EOS>
dear
Gilmore
!

"
  
<EOS>
I
have
expect
that
the
valet
would
be
dismiss
when
I
appear
,
but
nothing
of
the
sort
happen
.
<EOS>
there
he
stand
,
in
front
of
his
master
's
chair
,
tremble
under
the
weight
of
the
etching
,
and
there
Mr.
Fairlie
sit
,
serenely
twirl
the
magnify
glass
between
his
white
finger
and
thumb
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
speak
to
you
on
a
very
important
matter
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
you
will
therefore
excuse
me
,
if
I
suggest
that
we
have
better
be
alone

"
  
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
valet
look
at
me
gratefully
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
faintly
repeat
my
last
three
word
,
"
better
be
alone
,
"
with
every
appearance
of
the
utmost
possible
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
in
no
humour
for
trifling
,
and
I
resolve
to
make
him
understand
what
I
mean
.
  
<EOS>
"
oblige
me
by
give
that
man
permission
to
withdraw
,
"
I
say
,
point
to
the
valet
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
arch
his
eyebrow
and
purse
up
his
lip
in
sarcastic
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
man
?
"
he
repeat
.
<EOS>
"
You
provoking
old
Gilmore
,
what
can
you
possibly
mean
by
call
him
a
man
?
<EOS>
He
be
nothing
of
the
sort

<EOS>
He
may
have
be
a
man
half
an
hour
ago
,
before
I
want
my
etching
,
and
he
may
be
a
man
half
an
hour
hence
,
when
I
do
not
want
them
any
longer
.
<EOS>
at
present
he
be
simply
a
portfolio
stand

<EOS>
why
object

Gilmore

to
a
portfolio
stand

<EOS>

I
do
object

<EOS>
for
the
third
time
,
Mr.
Fairlie
,
I
beg
that
we
may
be
alone

"
  
<EOS>
My
tone
and
manner
leave
him
no
alternative
but
to
comply
with
my
request
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
the
servant
,
and
point
peevishly
to
a
chair
at
his
side

put
down
the
etching

away

he

you

you
not

lose
my
place

<EOS>
be
you
sure
you
have
not

<EOS>
and
have
you
put
my
hand
-
bell
quite
within
my
reach
?
<EOS>
yes
?
<EOS>
then
why
the
devil
do
not
you
go

"
  
<EOS>
the
valet
go
out
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
twist
himself
round
in
his
chair
,
polish
the
magnify
glass
with
his
delicate
cambric
handkerchief
,
and
indulge
himself
with
a
sidelong
inspection
of
the
open
volume
of
etching
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
to
keep
my
temper
under
these
circumstance
,
but
I
do
keep
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come

I
say
,

<EOS>
"

exclaim
Mr.

fall
back
helplessly

close
his
eye

I
go
on

reconsider
your
letter

once

never

on

I
put
all
the
point

him
carefully

I
set
the

before

light

He

back
in

chair
the
whole

I
be
speak
with
his
eye
close

when
I
have
do
he
open
them
indolently
,
take
his
silver
smelling
-
bottle
from

sniff
at
it

an
air
of
gentle
relish

Good

he

between
the
sniff

human
nature

give
me

again

Sir
Percival
Glyde
have
no
shadow

more

<EOS>
the

itself
if
your

no

ought
to
be
under

control

to
return
to
her

stand
firm

Sir
Percival
must
give
way
 
<EOS>
he
must
give

I
tell
you

expose
himself

the
base
imputation
of
marry
Miss
Fairlie
entirely

mercenary
motive

a
Radical

<EOS>
I
could
put
up
with
a
good
deal
of
provocation
,
but
,
after
hold
the
soundest
conservative
principle
all
my
life
,
I
could
not
put
up
with
be
call
a
Radical
.
<EOS>
My
blood
boil
at
it
 
<EOS>
I
start
out
of
my
chair
 
<EOS>
I
be
speechless
with
Indignation
.

<EOS>
cry
Mr.
Fairlie
 
"
for
Heaven
's

<EOS>
do
not
shake
the
room

<EOS>
worthiest
of
all
possible
gilmore
,
I
mean
no
offence
.
<EOS>
My
own
view
be
so
extremely
liberal
that
I
think
I
be
a
Radical
myself
.
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
We
be
a
pair
of
radical
.
<EOS>
please
do
not
be
angry

<EOS>
I
can
not

I
have
not

Shall

<EOS>
yes

come

do
now

a
good
Gilmore

"
  
<EOS>
while
he
be
maunder
on
in
this
way
I
be
,
fortunately
for
my
own
self
-
respect
,
return
to
my
sense
.
<EOS>
when
I
speak
again
I
be
compose
enough
to
treat
his
impertinence
with
the
silent
contempt
that
it
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
entirely
wrong
,
sir
,
"
I
say
,
"
in
supposing
that
I
speak
from
any
prejudice
against
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
I
may
regret
that
he
have
so
unreservedly
resign
himself
in
this
matter
to
his
lawyer
's
direction
as
to
make
any
appeal
to
himself
impossible
,
but
I
be
not
prejudice
against
him
.
<EOS>
what
I
have
say
would
equally
apply
to
any
other
man
in
his
situation
,
high
or
low
.
<EOS>
the
principle
I
maintain
be
a
recognise
principle
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
apply
at
the
near
town
here
,
to
the
first
respectable
solicitor
you
could
find
,
he
would
tell
you
as
a
stranger
what
I
tell
you
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
He
would
inform
you
that
it
be
against
all
rule
to
abandon
the
lady
's
money
entirely
to
the
man
she
marry
.
<EOS>
He
would
decline
,
on
ground
of
common
legal
caution
,
to
give
the
husband
,
under
any
circumstance
whatever
,
an
interest
of
twenty
thousand
pound
in

's
death

Would

Mr.

<EOS>
"
if
he

anything

at

before

<EOS>
this
morning
Mr.
Gilmore
leave
us
.
  
<EOS>
His
interview
with
Laura
have
evidently
grieve
and
surprise
him
more
than
he
like
to
confess
.
<EOS>
I
feel
afraid
,
from
his
look
and
manner
when
we
part
,
that
she
may
have
inadvertently
betray
to
him
the
real
secret
of
her
depression
and
my
anxiety
.
<EOS>
this
doubt
grow
on
me
so
,
after
he
have
go
,
that
I
decline
ride
out
with
Sir
Percival
,
and
go
up
to
Laura
's
room
instead
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
sadly
distrustful
of
myself
,
in
this
difficult
and
lamentable
matter
,
ever
since
I
find
out
my
own
ignorance
of
the
strength
of
Laura
's
unhappy
attachment
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
know
that
the
delicacy
and
forbearance
and
sense
of
honour
which
draw
me
to
poor
Hartright
,
and
make
me
so
sincerely
admire
and
respect
him
,
be
just
the
quality
to
appeal
most
irresistibly
to
Laura
's
natural
sensitiveness
and
natural
generosity
of
nature
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
until
she
open
her
heart
to
me
of
her
own
accord
,
I
have
no
suspicion
that
this
new
feeling
have
take
root
so
deeply
.
<EOS>
I
once
think
time
and
care
may
remove
it
.
<EOS>
I
now
fear
that
it
will
remain
with
her
and
alter
her
for
life
.
<EOS>
the
discovery
that
I
have
commit
such
an
error
in
judgment
as
this
make
me
hesitate
about
everything
else
.
<EOS>
I
hesitate
about
Sir
Percival
,
in
the
face
of
the
plain
proof
.
<EOS>
I
hesitate
even
in
speak
to
Laura
.
<EOS>
on
this
very
morning
I
doubt
,
with
my
hand
on
the
door
,
whether
I
should
ask
her
the
question
I
have
come
to
put
,
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
go
into
her
room
I
find
her
walk
up
and
down
in
great
impatience
.
<EOS>
She
look
flushed
and
excited
,
and
she
come
forward
at
once
,
and
speak
to
me
before
I
could
open
my
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
come
and
sit
down
on
the
sofa
with
me
.
<EOS>
Marian
!
<EOS>
I
can
bear
this
no
longer
 
<EOS>
I
must
and
will
end
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
too
much
colour
in
her
cheek
,
too
much
energy
in
her
manner
,
too
much
firmness
in
her
voice
.
<EOS>
the
little
book
of
Hartright
's
drawing
 
the
fatal
book
that
she
will
dream
over
whenever
she
be
alone
 
be
in
one
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
I
begin
by
gently
and
firmly
take
it
from
her
,
and
put
it
out
of
sight
on
a
side
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
quietly
,
my
darling
,
what
you
wish
to
do
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
have
Mr.
Gilmore
be
advise
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
not
in
what
I
be
think
of
now
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
kind
and
good
to
me
,
Marian
,
and
I
be
ashamed
to
say
I
distress
him
by
cry
.
<EOS>
I
be
miserably
helpless
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
control
myself
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
sake
,
and
for
all
our
sake
,
I
must
have
courage
enough
to
end
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
courage
enough
to
claim
your
release
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
she
say
simply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
courage
,
dear
,
to
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
arm
round
my
neck
,
and
rest
her
head
quietly
on
my
bosom
.
<EOS>
on
the
opposite
wall
hang
the
miniature
portrait
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
I
bend
over
her
,
and
see
that
she
be
look
at
it
while
her
head
lie
on
my
breast
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
claim
my
release
from
my
engagement
,
"
she
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
whatever
way
it
end
it
must
end
wretchedly
for
me
.
<EOS>
all
I
can
do
,
Marian
,
be
not
to
add
the
remembrance
that
I
have
break
my
promise
and
forgotten
my
father
's
dying
word
,
to
make
that
wretchedness
worse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
you
propose
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
tell
Sir
Percival
Glyde
the
truth
with
my
own
lip
,

she
answer
,
"
and
to
let
him
release
me
,
if
he
will

not
because
I
ask
him

but
because
he
know
all

<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean

Laura
,
by
"
all
"
?
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
will
know
enough
(
he
have
tell
me
so
himself
)
if
he
know
that
the
engagement
be
oppose
to
your

wish

<EOS>

Can
I
tell

that
,
when

engagement

consent

<EOS>
I
should
have
keep
my
promise

not
happily

I
be
afraid
,
but
still
contentedly
 
"
she
stop
,
turn
her
face
to
me
,
and
lay
her
cheek
close
against
mine
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
keep
my
engagement

Marian
,
if
another
love
have
not
grow
up
in
my
heart

be
not
there

first
promise

you
will
never
lower
yourself
by
make
a
confession
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>

I
shall
lower
myself
,
indeed

if
I
gain
my
release
by
hide
from
him
what

have
a
right
to
know

I
ought
to
deceive
no

least

all

man

whom
my
father
give
me
,
and

whom
I
give

<EOS>
She
put
her
lip
to
mine

and
kiss
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
own
love

she
say
softly
,

you
be
so
much
too
fond

proud

that
you
forget

in
my
case

what
you
would
remember

<EOS>
better
that
Sir
Percival
should
doubt
my
motive
,
and
misjudge
my
conduct
if
he
will
,
than
that
I
should
be
first
false
to

in
thought

then
mean
enough

serve

by

the
falsehood

<EOS>
I
hold
her
away
from
me
in
astonishment

<EOS>
for
the
first
time
in
our
life
we
have
change
place
 
<EOS>
the
resolution
be
all
on
her
side
,
the
hesitation
all
on
mine
.
<EOS>
I
look
into
the
pale
,
quiet
,
resign
young
face
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
pure
,
innocent
heart
,
in
the
loving
eye
that
look
back
at
me
 
and
the
poor
worldly
caution
and
objection
that
rise
to
my
lip
dwindle
and
die
away
in
their
own
emptiness
.
<EOS>
I
hang
my
head
in
silence
.
<EOS>
in
her
place
the
despicably
small
pride
which
make
so
many
woman
deceitful
would
have
be
my
pride
,
and
would
have
make
me
deceitful
too

do
not

mistake
my
silence

<EOS>
I
only
answer
by
draw
her
close
to
me
again

<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
cry
if
I
speak

<EOS>
My
tear
do
not
flow
so
easily
as
they
ought
 
<EOS>
they
come
almost
like
man
's
tear
,
with
sobs
that
seem
to
tear
me
in
piece
,
and
that
frighten
every
one
about
me

<EOS>
"
I
have
think
of
this

love

for
many
day
,
"
she
go
on
,
twine
and
twist
my
hair
with
that
childish
restlessness
in
her
finger
,
which
poor
Mrs.
Vesey
still
try
so
patiently
and
so
vainly
to
cure
her
of
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
of
it
very
seriously
,
and
I
can
be
sure
of
my
courage
when
my
own
conscience
tell
me
I
be
right
.
<EOS>
let
me
speak
to
him
to
-
morrow
 
in
your
presence
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
that
be
wrong
,
nothing
that
you
or
I
need
be
ashamed
of
 
<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
it
will
ease
my
heart
so
to
end
this
miserable
concealment
!
<EOS>
only
let
me
know
and
feel
that
I
have
no
deception
to
answer
for
on
my
side
,
and
then
,
when
he
have
hear
what
I
have
to
say
,
let
him
act
towards
me
as
he
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sigh
,
and
put
her
head
back
in
its
old
position
on
my
bosom
.
<EOS>
sad
misgiving
about
what
the
end
would
be
weigh
upon
my
mind
,
but
still
distrust
myself
,
I
tell
her
that
I
would
do
as
she
wish
.
<EOS>
She
thank
me
,
and
we
pass
gradually
into
talking
of
other
thing
.
  
<EOS>
at
dinner
she
join
us
again
,
and
be
more
easy
and
more
herself
with
Sir
Percival
than
I
have
see
her
yet
.
<EOS>
in
the
evening
she
go
to
the
piano
,
choose
new
music
of
the
dexterous
,
tuneless
,
florid
kind
.
<EOS>
the
lovely
old
melody
of
Mozart
,
which
poor
Hartright
be
so
fond
of
,
she
have
never
play
since
he
leave
.
<EOS>
the
book
be
no
longer
in
the
music
-
stand
.
<EOS>
She
take
the
volume
away
herself
,
so
that
nobody
may
find
it
out
and
ask
her
to
play
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
opportunity
of
discover
whether
her
purpose
of
the
morning
have
change
or
not
,
until
she
wish
Sir
Percival
good
-
night
 
<EOS>
and
then
her
own
word
inform
me
that
it
be
unaltered
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
very
quietly
,
that
she
wish
to
speak
to
him
after
breakfast
,
and
that
he
would
find
her
in
her
sitting
-
room
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
change
colour
at
those
word
,
and
I
feel
his
hand
tremble
a
little
when
it
come
to
my
turn
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
the
event
of
the
next
morning
would
decide
his
future
life
,
and
he
evidently
know
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
in
,
as
usual
,
through
the
door
between
our
two
bedroom
,
to
bid
Laura
good
-
night
before
she
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
in
stoop
over
her
to
kiss
her
<EOS>
I
see
the
little
book
of
Hartright
's
drawing
half
hide
under
her
pillow
,
just
in
the
place
where
she
use
to
hide
her
favourite
toy
when
she
be
a
child
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
say
anything
,
but
I
point
to
the
book
and
shake
my
head
.
<EOS>
She
reach
both
hand
up
to
my
cheek
,
and
draw
my
face
down
to
her
till
our
lip
meet
.
  
<EOS>
"
leave
it
there
to
-
night
,
"
she
whisper
;
"
to
-
morrow
may
be
cruel
,
and
may
make
me
say
good
-
bye
to
it
for
ever
.
"
  
<EOS>
9th
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
event
of
the
morning
be
not
of
a
kind
to
raise
my
spirit
 
a
letter
arrive
for
me
from
poor
Walter
Hartright
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
answer
to
mine
describe
the
manner
in
which
Sir
Percival
clear
himself
of
the
suspicion
raise
by
Anne
Catherick
's
letter
.
<EOS>
He
write
shortly
and
bitterly
about
Sir
Percival
's
explanation
,
only
say
that
he
have
no
right
to
offer
an
opinion
on
the
conduct
of
those
who
be
above
him
.
<EOS>
this
be
sad
,
but
his
occasional
reference
to
himself
grieve
me
still
more
.
<EOS>
He
say
that
the
effort
to
return
to
his
old
habit
and
pursuit
grow
hard
instead
of
easy
to
him
every
day
and
he
implore
me
,
if
I
have
any
interest
,
to
exert
it
to
get
him
employment
that
will
necessitate
his
absence
from
England
,
and
take
him
among
new
scene
and
new
people
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
make
all
the
ready
to
comply
with
this
request
by
a
passage
at
the
end
of
his
letter
,
which
have
almost
alarm
me
.
  
<EOS>
after
mention
that
he
have
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
of
Anne
Catherick
,
he
suddenly
break
off
,
and
hint
in
the
most
abrupt
,
mysterious
manner
,
that
he
have
be
perpetually
watch
and
follow
by
strange
man
ever
since
he
return
to
London
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledge
that
he
can
not
prove
this
extraordinary
suspicion
by
fix
on
any
particular
person
,
but
he
declare
that
the
suspicion
itself
be
present
to
him
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
this
have
frighten
me
,
because
it
look
as
if
his
one
fix
idea
about
Laura
be
become
too
much
for
his
mind
.
<EOS>
I
will
write
immediately
to
some
of
my
mother
's
influential
old
friend
in
London
,
and
press
his
claim
on
their
notice
.
<EOS>
change
of
scene
and
change
of
occupation
may
really
be
the
salvation
of
him
at
this
crisis
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
greatly
to
my
relief
,
Sir
Percival
send
an
apology
for
not
join
us
at
breakfast
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
an
early
cup
of
coffee
in
his
own
room
,
and
he
be
still
engage
there
in
write
letter
.
<EOS>
at
eleven
o'clock
,
if
that
hour
be
convenient
,
he
would
do
himself
the
honour
of
wait
on
Miss
Fairlie
and
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
My
eye
be
on
Laura
's
face
while
the
message
be
be
deliver
.
<EOS>
I
have
find
her
unaccountably
quiet
and
compose
on
go
into
her
room
in
the
morning
,
and
so
she
remain
all
through
breakfast
.
<EOS>
even
when
we
be
sit
together
on
the
sofa
in
her
room
,
wait
for
Sir
Percival
,
she
still
preserve
her
self
-
control
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
afraid
of
me
,
Marian
,
"
be
all
she
say
;
"
I
may
forget
myself
with
an
old
friend
like
Mr.
Gilmore
,
or
with
a
dear
sister
like
you
,
but
I
will
not
forget
myself
with
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
look
at
her
,
and
listen
to
her
in
silent
surprise
.
<EOS>
through
all
the
year
of
our
close
intimacy
this
passive
force
in
her
character
have
be
hide
from
me
 
hide
even
from
herself
,
till
love
find
it
,
and
suffering
call
it
forth
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
strike
eleven
Sir
Percival
knock
at
the
door
and
come
in
.
<EOS>
there
be
suppress
anxiety
and
agitation
in
every
line
of
his
face
.
<EOS>
the
dry
,
sharp
cough
,
which
tease
him
at
most
time
,
seem
to
be
trouble
him
more
incessantly
than
ever
.
<EOS>
He
sit
down
opposite
to
us
at
the
table
,
and
Laura
remain
by
me
.
<EOS>
I
look
attentively
at
them
both
,
and
he
be
the
palest
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
a
few
unimportant
word
,
with
a
visible
effort
to
preserve
his
customary
ease
of
manner
.
<EOS>
but
his
voice
be
not
to
be
steady
,
and
the
restless
uneasiness
in
his
eye
be
not
to
be
conceal
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
feel
this
himself
,
for
he
stop
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
,
and
give
up
even
the
attempt
to
hide
his
embarrassment
any
longer
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
just
one
moment
of
dead
silence
before
Laura
address
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
,
Sir
Percival
,
"
she
say
,
"
on
a
subject
that
be
very
important
to
us
both
.
<EOS>
My
sister
be
here
,
because
her
presence
help
me
and
give
me
confidence
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
suggest
one
word
of
what
I
be
go
to
say
 
I
speak
from
my
own
thought
,
not
from
hers
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
understand
that
before
I
go
any
farther
?
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
bow
.
<EOS>
She
have
proceed
thus
far
,
with
perfect
outward
tranquillity
and
perfect
propriety
of
manner
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
,
and
he
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
They
seem
,
at
the
outset
,
at
least
,
resolve
to
understand
one
another
plainly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
from
Marian
,
"
she
go
on
,
"
that
I
have
only
to
claim
my
release
from
our
engagement
to
obtain
that
release
from
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
forbear
and
generous
on
your
part
,
Sir
Percival
,
to
send
me
such
a
message
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
do
you
justice
to
say
that
I
be
grateful
for
the
offer
,
and
I
hope
and
believe
that
it
be
only
do
myself
justice
to
tell
you
that
I
decline
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
attentive
face
relax
a
little
.
<EOS>
but
I
see
one
of
his
foot
,
softly
,
quietly
,
incessantly
beat
on
the
carpet
under
the
table
,
and
I
feel
that
he
be
secretly
as
anxious
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
forget
,
"
she
say
,
"
that
you
ask
my
father
's
permission
before
you
honour
me
with
a
proposal
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
have
not
forget
either
what
I
say
when
I
consent
to
our
engagement
?
<EOS>
I
venture
to
tell
you
that
my
father
's
influence
and
advice
have
mainly
decide
me
to
give
you
my
promise
.
<EOS>
I
be
guide
by
my
father
,
because
I
have
always
find
him
the
true
of
all
adviser
,
the
good
and
fond
of
all
protector
and
friend
.
<EOS>
I
have
lose
him
now
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
his
memory
to
love
,
but
my
faith
in
that
dear
dead
friend
have
never
be
shake
.
<EOS>
I
believe
at
this
moment
,
as
truly
as
I
ever
believe
,
that
he
know
what
be
good
,
and
that
his
hope
and
wish
ought
to
be
my
hope
and
wish
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
voice
tremble
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Her
restless
finger
steal
their
way
into
my
lap
,
and
hold
fast
by
one
of
my
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
moment
of
silence
,
and
then
Sir
Percival
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
"
he
say
,
"
if
I
have
ever
prove
myself
unworthy
of
the
trust
which
it
have
be
hitherto
my
great
honour
and
great
happiness
to
possess
?
"
  
"
I
have
find
nothing
in
your
conduct
to
blame
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
always
treat
me
with
the
same
delicacy
and
the
same
forbearance
.
<EOS>
You
have
deserve
my
trust
,
and
,
what
be
of
far
more
importance
in
my
estimation
,
you
have
deserve
my
father
's
trust
,
out
of
which
mine
grow
.
<EOS>
You
have
give
me
no
excuse
,
even
if
I
have
want
to
find
one
,
for
ask
to
be
release
from
my
pledge
.
<EOS>
what
I
have
say
so
far
have
be
speak
with
the
wish
to
acknowledge
my
whole
obligation
to
you
.
<EOS>
My
regard
for
that
obligation
,
my
regard
for
my
father
's
memory
,
and
my
regard
for
my
own
promise
,
all
forbid
me
to
set
the
example
,
on
my
side
,
of
withdraw
from
our
present
position
.
<EOS>
the
breaking
of
our
engagement
must
be
entirely
your
wish
and
your
act
,
Sir
Percival
 
not
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
uneasy
beating
of
his
foot
suddenly
stop
,
and
he
lean
forward
eagerly
across
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
act
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
what
reason
can
there
be
on
my
side
for
withdraw
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
hear
her
breath
quicken
 
<EOS>
I
feel
her
hand
grow
cold
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
what
she
have
say
to
me
when
we
be
alone
,
I
begin
to
be
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
be
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
reason
that
it
be
very
hard
to
tell
you
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
change
in
me
,
Sir
Percival
 
a
change
which
be
serious
enough
to
justify
you
,
to
yourself
and
to
me
,
in
break
off
our
engagement
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
face
turn
so
pale
again
that
even
his
lip
lose
their
colour
.
<EOS>
He
raise
the
arm
which
lie
on
the
table
,
turn
a
little
away
in
his
chair
,
and
support
his
head
on
his
hand
,
so
that
his
profile
only
be
present
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
change
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
the
tone
in
which
he
put
the
question
jar
on
me
 
there
be
something
painfully
suppress
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
sigh
heavily
,
and
lean
towards
me
a
little
,
so
as
to
rest
her
shoulder
against
mine
.
<EOS>
I
feel
her
tremble
,
and
try
to
spare
her
by
speak
myself
.
<EOS>
She
stop
me
by
a
warning
pressure
of
her
hand
,
and
then
address
Sir
Percival
one
more
,
but
this
time
without
look
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
,
"
she
say
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
believe
it
,
that
the
fond
and
true
of
all
affection
be
the
affection
which
a
woman
ought
to
bear
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
when
our
engagement
begin
that
affection
be
mine
to
give
,
if
I
could
,
and
your
to
win
,
if
you
could
.
<EOS>
Will
you
pardon
me
,
and
spare
me
,
Sir
Percival
,
if
I
acknowledge
that
it
be
not
so
any
longer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
few
tear
gather
in
her
eye
,
and
drop
over
her
cheek
slowly
as
she
pause
and
wait
for
his
answer
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
at
the
beginning
of
her
reply
he
have
move
the
hand
on
which
his
head
rest
,
so
that
it
hide
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
but
the
upper
part
of
his
figure
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
not
a
muscle
of
him
move
.
<EOS>
the
finger
of
the
hand
which
support
his
head
be
dent
deep
in
his
hair
.
<EOS>
They
may
have
express
hide
anger
or
hide
grief
 
<EOS>
it
be
hard
to
say
which
 
there
be
no
significant
tremble
in
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
,
absolutely
nothing
,
to
tell
the
secret
of
his
thought
at
that
moment
 
the
moment
which
be
the
crisis
of
his
life
and
the
crisis
of
hers
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
make
him
declare
himself
,
for
Laura
's
sake
.

"
Sir
Percival
!

Her

try

so

my

<EOS>
"
the
least
that
you

He
raise
it
gently
to
his
lip
 
touch
it
with
them
,
rather
than
kiss
it
 
bow
to
me

then
,
with
perfect
delicacy

discretion
,
silently
quit

I
see
it
be
hopeless

useless
to
speak

I
only
put
my
arm
round
her

and
hold
her
to
me
in
silence

<EOS>
We
remain
together
so
for
what
seem
a
long
and
weary
time
 
so
long
and
so
weary

that
I
grow
uneasy

speak
to
her
softly
,
in
the
hope
of
produce
a
change

<EOS>
the
sound
of
my
voice
seem

startle
her
into
consciousness

She

away

as

a
side

table
near
the
window

on
which
her
sketching
material
be

and
have
take

the
album
that
contain
Walter

<EOS>
She
hesitate
for
a
moment
,
hold

little
volume
fondly
in

then
lift
it
to
her
lip

I

not

It

<EOS>
"
I

She
lay
the
book
on

comb
that
fasten
her
hair

<EOS>
It
fall
,
in
its
matchless
beauty

over
her
back

and
drop
round

far
below

<EOS>
She
separate
one
long

thin
lock
from
the
rest
,
cut
it
off
,
and
pin
it
carefully
,
in
the
form
of
a
circle

on
the
first
blank
page
of
the
album
.
<EOS>
the
moment
it
be
fasten
she
close
the
volume
hurriedly
,
and
place
it
in
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
while

this
little
book

there
can
be
no

<EOS>
She
fling
her
arm
round
my
neck
,
and
whisper
the
last
word
in
my
ear
with
a
passionate
delight
in
utter
them
which
it
almost
break
my
heart
to
hear
.
<EOS>
all
the
long
restraint
she
have
impose
on
herself
give
way
in
that
first
last
outburst
of
tenderness
.
<EOS>
She
break
from
me
with
hysterical
vehemence
,
and
throw
herself
on
the
sofa
in
a
paroxysm
of
sobs
and
tear
that
shake
her
from
head
to
foot
.
  
<EOS>
I
try
vainly
to
soothe
her
and
reason
with
her
 
<EOS>
she
be
past
be
soothe
,
and
past
be
reason
with
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
sad
,
sudden
end
for
us
two
of
this
memorable
day
.
<EOS>
when
the
fit
have
wear
itself
out
<EOS>
she
be
too
exhausted
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
slumber
towards
the
afternoon
,
and
I
put
away
the
book
of
drawing
so
that
she
may
not
see
it
when
she
wake
.
<EOS>
My
face
be
calm
,
whatever
my
heart
may
be
,
when
she
open
her
eye
again
and
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
We
say
no
more
to
each
other
about
the
distressing
interview
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
name
be
not
mention
.
<EOS>
Walter
Hartright
be
not
allude
to
again
by
either
of
us
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
10th
.
 
<EOS>
find
that
she
be
compose
<EOS>
and
like
herself
this
morning
,
I
return
to
the
painful
subject
of
yesterday
,
for
the
sole
purpose
of
implore
her
to
let
me
speak
to
Sir
Percival
and
Mr.
Fairlie
,
more
plainly
and
strongly
than
she
could
speak
to
either
of
them
herself
,
about
this
lamentable
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
interpose
,
gently
but
firmly
,
in
the
middle
of
my
remonstrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
leave
yesterday
to
decide
,
"
she
say
;
"
and
yesterday
have
decide
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
speak
to
me
this
afternoon
about
what
have
pass
in
Laura
's
room
.
<EOS>
He
assure
me
that
the
unparalleled
trust
she
have
place
in
him
have
awaken
such
an
answer
conviction
of
her
innocence
and
integrity
in
his
mind
,
that
he
be
guiltless
of
have
feel
even
a
moment
's
unworthy
jealousy
,
either
at
the
time
when
he
be
in
her
presence
,
or
afterwards
when
he
have
withdraw
from
it
.
<EOS>
deeply
as
he
lament
the
unfortunate
attachment
which
have
hinder
the
progress
he
may
otherwise
have
make
in
her
esteem
and
regard
,
he
firmly
believe
that
it
have
remain
unacknowledged
in
the
past
,
and
that
it
would
remain
,
under
all
change
of
circumstance
which
it
be
possible
to
contemplate
,
unacknowledged
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
absolute
conviction
;
and
the
strong
proof
he
could
give
of
it
be
the
assurance
,
which
he
now
offer
,
that
he
feel
no
curiosity
to
know
whether
the
attachment
be
of
recent
date
or
not
,
or
who
have
be
the
object
of
it
.
<EOS>
His
implicit
confidence
in
Miss
Fairlie
make
him
satisfied
with
what
she
have
think
fit
to
say
to
him
,
and
he
be
honestly
innocent
of
the
slight
feeling
of
anxiety
to
hear
more
.
  
<EOS>
He
wait
after
say
those
word
and
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
conscious
of
my
unreasonable
prejudice
against
him
 
so
conscious
of
an
unworthy
suspicion
that
he
may
be
speculate
on
my
impulsively
answer
the
very
question
which
he
have
just
describe
himself
as
resolve
not
to
ask
 
that
I
evade
all
reference
to
this
part
of
the
subject
with
something
like
a
feeling
of
confusion
on
my
own
part
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
I
be
resolve
not
to
lose
even
the
small
opportunity
of
try
to
plead
Laura
's
cause
,
and
I
tell
him
boldly
that
I
regret
his
generosity
have
not
carry
him
one
step
farther
,
and
induce
him
to
withdraw
from
the
engagement
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
again
,
he
disarm
me
by
not
attempt
to
defend
himself
.
<EOS>
He
would
merely
beg
me
to
remember
the
difference
there
be
between
his
allow
Miss
Fairlie
to
give
him
up
,
which
be
a
matter
of
submission
only
,
and
his
force
himself
to
give
up
Miss
Fairlie
,
which
be
,
in
other
word
,
ask
him
to
be
the
suicide
of
his
own
hope
.
<EOS>
Her
conduct
of
the
day
before
have
so
strengthen
the
unchangeable
love
and
admiration
of
two
long
year
,
that
all
active
contention
against
those
feeling
,
on
his
part
,
be
henceforth
entirely
out
of
his
power
.
<EOS>
I
must
think
him
weak
,
selfish
,
unfeele
towards
the
very
woman
whom
he
idolise
,
and
he
must
bow
to
my
opinion
as
resignedly
as
he
could
 
only
put
it
to
me
,
at
the
same
time
,
whether
her
future
as
a
single
woman
,
pine
under
an
unhappily
place
attachment
which
she
could
never
acknowledge
,
could
be
say
to
promise
her
a
much
bright
prospect
than
her
future
as
the
wife
of
a
man
who
worship
the
very
ground
she
walk
on
?
<EOS>
in
the
last
case
there
be
hope
from
time
,
however
slight
it
may
be
 
in
the
first
case
,
on
her
own
showing
,
there
be
no
hope
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
answer
him
 
more
because
my
tongue
be
a
woman
's
,
and
must
answer
,
than
because
I
have
anything
convincing
to
say
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
too
plain
that
the
course
Laura
have
adopt
the
day
before
have
offer
him
the
advantage
if
he
choose
to
take
it
 
and
that
he
have
choose
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
I
feel
this
at
the
time
,
and
I
feel
it
just
as
strongly
now
,
while
I
write
these
line
,
in
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
the
one
hope
leave
be
that
his
motive
really
spring
,
as
he
say
they
do
,
from
the
irresistible
strength
of
his
attachment
to
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
close
my
diary
for
to
-
night
<EOS>
I
must
record
that
I
write
to
-
day
,
in
poor
Hartright
's
interest
,
to
two
of
my
mother
's
old
friend
in
London
 
both
man
of
influence
and
position
.
<EOS>
if
they
can
do
anything
for
him
,
I
be
quite
sure
they
will
.
<EOS>
except
Laura
,
I
never
be
more
anxious
about
any
one
than
I
be
now
about
Walter
.
<EOS>
all
that
have
happen
since
he
leave
us
have
only
increase
my
strong
regard
and
sympathy
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
be
do
right
in
try
to
help
him
to
employment
abroad
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
most
earnestly
and
anxiously
,
that
it
will
end
well
.

11th

<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
an
interview
with
Mr.
Fairlie
,
and
I
be
send
for
to
join
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
Mr.
Fairlie
greatly
relieve
at
the
prospect
of
the
"
family
worry
"
(
as
he
be
pleased
to
describe
his
niece
's
marriage
)
be
settle
at
last
.
<EOS>
so
far
,
I
do
not
feel
call
on
to
say
anything
to
him
about
my
own
opinion
,
but
when
he
proceed
,
in
his
most
aggravatingly
languid
manner
,
to
suggest
that
the
time
for
the
marriage
have
better
be
settle
next
,
in
accordance
with
Sir
Percival
's
wish
,
I
enjoy
the
satisfaction
of
assail
Mr.
Fairlie
's
nerve
with
as
strong
a
protest
against
hurry
Laura
's
decision
as
I
could
put
into
word
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
immediately
assure
me
that
he
feel
the
force
of
my
objection
,
and
beg
me
to
believe
that
the
proposal
have
not
be
make
in
consequence
of
any
interference
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
lean
back
in
his
chair
,
close
his
eye
,
say
we
both
of
us
do
honour
to
human
nature
,
and
then
repeat
his
suggestion
as
coolly
as
if
neither
Sir
Percival
nor
I
have
say
a
word
in
opposition
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
end
in
my
flatly
decline
to
mention
the
subject
to
Laura
,
unless
she
first
approach
it
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
I
leave
the
room
at
once
after
make
that
declaration
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
look
seriously
embarrassed
and
distress
,
Mr.
Fairlie
stretch
out
his
lazy
leg
on
his
velvet
footstool
,
and
say
,
"
dear
Marian
!
<EOS>
how
I
envy
you
your
robust
nervous
system
!
<EOS>
do
not
bang
the
door
!
"
  
<EOS>
on
go
to
Laura
's
room
I
find
that
she
have
ask
for
me
,
and
that
Mrs.
Vesey
have
inform
her
that
I
be
with
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
She
inquire
at
once
what
I
have
be
want
for
,
and
I
tell
her
all
that
have
pass
,
without
attempt
to
conceal
the
vexation
and
annoyance
that
I
really
feel
.
<EOS>
Her
answer
surprise
and
distress
me
inexpressibly
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
very
last
reply
that
I
should
have
expect
her
to
make
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
be
right
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
cause
trouble
and
anxiety
enough
to
you
,
and
to
all
about
me
.
<EOS>
let
me
cause
no
more
<EOS>
,
marian
 
let
Sir
Percival
decide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
remonstrate
warmly
,
but
nothing
that
I
could
say
move
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
hold
to
my
engagement
,
"
she
reply
;
"
I
have
break
with
my
old
life
.
<EOS>
the
evil
day
will
not
come
the
less
surely
because
I
put
it
off
.
<EOS>
no
,
Marian
!
<EOS>
once
again
my
uncle
be
right
.
<EOS>
I
have
cause
trouble
enough
and
anxiety
enough
,
and
I
will
cause
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
use
to
be
pliability
itself
,
but
she
be
now
inflexibly
passive
in
her
resignation
 
<EOS>
I
may
almost
say
in
her
despair
.
<EOS>
dearly
as
I
love
her
,
I
should
have
be
less
pain
if
she
have
be
violently
agitate
 
<EOS>
it
be
so
shockingly
unlike
her
natural
character
to
see
her
as
cold
and
insensible
as
I
see
her
now
.
  
<EOS>
12th
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
put
some
question
to
me
at
breakfast
about
Laura
,
which
leave
me
no
choice
but
to
tell
him
what
she
have
say
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
talk
she
herself
come
down
and
join
us
.
<EOS>
She
be
just
as
unnaturally
compose
in
Sir
Percival
's
presence
as
she
have
be
in
mine
.
<EOS>
when
breakfast
be
over
he
have
an
opportunity
of
say
a
few
word
to
her
privately
,
in
a
recess
of
one
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
more
than
two
or
three
minute
together
,
and
on
their
separating
she
leave
the
room
with
Mrs.
Vesey
,
while
Sir
Percival
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
entreat
her
to
favour
him
by
maintain
her
privilege
of
fix
the
time
for
the
marriage
at
her
own
will
and
pleasure
.
<EOS>
in
reply
she
have
merely
express
her
acknowledgment
,
and
have
desire
him
to
mention
what
his
wish
be
to
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
patience
to
write
more
.
<EOS>
in
this
instance
,
as
in
every
other
,
Sir
Percival
have
carry
his
point
with
the
utmost
possible
credit
to
himself
,
in
spite
of
everything
that
I
can
say
or
do
.
<EOS>
His
wish
be
now
,
what
they
be
,
of
course
,
when
he
first
come
here
;
and
Laura
have
resign
herself
to
the
one
inevitable
sacrifice
of
the
marriage
,
remain
as
coldly
hopeless
and
enduring
as
ever
.
<EOS>
in
part
with
the
little
occupation
and
relic
that
remind
her
of
Hartright
,
she
seem
to
have
part
with
all
her
tenderness
and
all
her
impressibility
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
while
I
write
these
line
,
and
Sir
Percival
have
leave
us
already
,
in
the
happy
hurry
of
a
bridegroom
,
to
prepare
for
the
bride
's
reception
at
his
house
in
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
unless
some
extraordinary
event
happen
to
prevent
it
they
will
be
marry
exactly
at
the
time
when
he
wish
to
be
marry
 
before
the
end
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
My
very
finger

as
I
write
it
!
  
<EOS>
13th
.
 
<EOS>
a
sleepless
night
,
through
uneasiness
about
Laura
.
<EOS>
towards
the
morning
I
come
to
a
resolution
to
try
what
change
of
scene
would
do
to
rouse
her
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
surely
remain
in
her
present
torpor
of
insensibility
,
if
I
take
her
away
from
Limmeridge
and
surround
her
with
the
pleasant
face
of
old
friend
?
<EOS>
after
some
consideration
I
decide
on
write
to
the
Arnolds
,
in
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
They
be
simple
,
kind
-
hearted
,
hospitable
people
,
and
she
have
know
them
from
her
childhood
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
put
the
letter
in
the
post
-
bag
I
tell
her
what
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
a
relief
to
me
if
she
have
show
the
spirit
to
resist
and
object
.
<EOS>
but
no
 
<EOS>
she
only
say
,
"
I
will
go
anywhere
with
you
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
be
right
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
the
change
will
do
me
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
14th
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
to
Mr.
Gilmore
,
inform
him
that
there
be
really
a
prospect
of
this
miserable
marriage
take
place
,
and
also
mention
my
idea
of
try
what
change
of
scene
would
do
for
Laura
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
heart
to
go
into
particular
.
<EOS>
Time
enough
for
them

we
get
near

<EOS>
His

a
farewell
line
when

I
can
only
hope
and
pray
earnestly
that
he
and
I
be
both

in
this
matter
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
It
seem
such
a
serious
step
for
him
to
take
,
that
the
mere
contemplation
of
it
startle
me
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
in
his
unhappy
position
,
how
can
I
expect
him
or
wish
him
to
remain
at
home

and
alteration
in
his
house
in
Hampshire
would
occupy
a
much
long
time
in
completion
than
he
have
originally
anticipate
.
<EOS>
the
proper
estimate
be
to
be
submit
to
him
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
it
would
greatly
facilitate
his
entering
into
definite
arrangement
with
the
workpeople
,
if
he
could
be
inform
of
the
exact
period
at
which
the
wedding
ceremony
may
be
expect
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
He
could
then
make
all
his
calculation
in
reference
to
time
,
besides
write
the
necessary
apology
to
friend

<EOS>
feel

unless
I
could
first
obtain
Laura
's
authority
to
make
it
,

consent
to

so
strangely
and
so
resolutely
maintain
ever
since
Sir

be
not
proof

the
slight
hint
she
could
give
be
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
rise
to
leave
the
room
,
and
fight
her
battle
for
her
at
once
with
Mr.
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
my
hand
be
on
the
door
,
she
catch
fast
hold
of
my
dress
and
stop
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
go
!
"
<EOS>
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
My
tongue
burn
to
tell
your
uncle
that
he
and
Sir
Percival
be
not
to
have
it
all
their
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sigh
bitterly
,
and
still
hold
my
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
too
late
,
Marian
,
too
late
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
a
minute
too
late
,
"
I
retort
.
<EOS>
"
the
question
of
time
be
our
question
 
and
trust
me
,
Laura
,
to
take
a
woman
's
full
advantage
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
unclasp
her
hand
from
my
gown
while
I
speak
;
but
she
slip
both
her
arm
round
my
waist
at
the
same
moment
,
and
hold
me
more
effectually
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
only
involve
us
in
more
trouble
and
more
confusion
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
set
you
and
my
uncle
at
variance
,
and
bring
Sir
Percival
here
again
with
fresh
cause
of
complaint
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
much
the
well
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
cry
out
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
who
care
for
his
cause
of
complaint
?
<EOS>
be
you
to
break
your
heart
to
set
his
mind
at
ease
?
<EOS>
no
man
under
heaven
deserve
these
sacrifice
from
us
woman
.
<EOS>
man
!
<EOS>
They
be
the
enemy
of
our
innocence
and
our
peace
 
they
drag
us
away
from
our
parent
'
love
and
our
sister
'
friendship
 
<EOS>
they
take
us
body
and
soul
to
themselves
,
and
fasten
our
helpless
life
to
theirs
as
they
chain
up
a
dog
to
his
kennel

<EOS>
and
what
do
the
good
of
them
give
us
in
return
?
<EOS>
let
me
go
,
Laura
 
<EOS>
I
be
mad
when
I
think
of
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
tear
 
miserable
,
weak
,
woman
's
tear
of
vexation
and
rage
 
start
to
my
eye
.
<EOS>
She
smile
sadly
,
and
put
her
handkerchief
over
my
face
to
hide
for
me
the
betrayal
of
my
own
weakness
 
the
weakness
of
all
other
which
she
know
that
I
most
despised
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Marian
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
cry
!
<EOS>
think
what
you
would

me

if
the

change

be
mine

<EOS>
all
your
love

not

have
his

us
have
no

burning
that
any

mine
can
prevent

say
you
will
live
with
me
,
Marian
,
when
I
be
married
 
and
say
no
more

"
  
<EOS>
but
I
do
say
more
.
<EOS>
I
force
back
the
contemptible
tear
that
be
no
relief
to
me
,
and
that
only
distress
HER
,
and
reason
and
plead
as
calmly
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
avail
.
<EOS>
She
make
me
twice
repeat
the
promise
to
live
with
her
when
she
be
married
,
and
then
suddenly
ask
a
question
which
turn
my
sorrow
and
my
sympathy
for
her
into
a
new
direction
.
  
<EOS>
"
while
we
be
at
Polesdean
,
"
she
say
,
"
you
have
a
letter
,
Marian
 
<EOS>
"
  
Her
altered
tone
 
<EOS>
the
abrupt
manner
in
which
she
look
away
from
me
and
hide
her
face
on
my
shoulder
 
the
hesitation
which
silence
her
before
she
have
complete
her
question
<EOS>
,
all
tell
me
,
but
too
plainly
,
to
whom
the
half
-
express
inquiry
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Laura
,
that
you
and
I
be
never

refer
to
him
again

I
say
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
letter
from
him
?

<EOS>
she
persist
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
reply
,
"
if
you
must
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
to
write
to
him
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hesitate
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
afraid
to
tell
her
of
his
absence
from
England
,
or
of
the
manner
in
which
my
exertion
to
serve
his
new
hope
and
project
have
connect
me
with
his
departure
.
<EOS>
what
answer
could
I
make
?
<EOS>
He
be
go
where
no
letter
could
reach
him
for
month
,
perhaps
for
year
,
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
I
do
mean
to
write
to
him
again
,
"
I
say
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
what
then
,
Laura
?
"
  
Her
cheek
grow
burn
hot
against
my
neck
,
and
her
arm
tremble
and
tighten
round
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
tell
him
about
the
TWENTY
-
second
,
"
she
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
promise
,
marian
 
pray
promise
you
will
not
even
mention
my
name
to
him
when
you
write
next
.
"
  
I
give
the
promise
.
<EOS>
no
word
can
say
how
sorrowfully
I
give
it
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
take
her
arm
from
my
waist
,
walk
away
to
the
window
,
and
stand
look
out
with
her
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
after
a
moment
she
speak
once
more
,
but
without
turn
round
,
without
allow
me
to
catch
the
small
glimpse
of
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
to
my
uncle
's
room
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
say
that
I
consent
to
whatever
arrangement
he
may
think
best
?
<EOS>
never
mind
leave
me
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
better
alone
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
go
out
.
<EOS>
if
,
as
soon
as
I
get
into
the
passage
,
I
could
have
transport
Mr.
Fairlie
and
Sir
Percival
Glyde
to
the
uttermost
end
of
the
earth
by
lift
one
of
my
finger
,
that
finger
would
have
be
raise
without
an
instant
's
hesitation
.
<EOS>
for
once
my
unhappy
temper
now
stand
my
friend
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
break
down
altogether
and
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
crying
,
if
my
tear
have
not
be
all
burn
up
in
the
heat
of
my
anger
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
dash
into
Mr.
Fairlie
's
room
 
call
to
him
as
harshly
as
possible
,
"
Laura
consent
to
the
twenty
-
second
"
 
and
dash
out
again
without
wait
for
a
word
of
answer
.
<EOS>
I
bang
the
door
after
me
,
and
I
hope
I
shatter
Mr.
Fairlie
's
nervous
system
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
28th
.
 
<EOS>
this
morning
I
read
poor
Hartright
's
farewell
letter
over
again
,
a
doubt
have
cross
my
mind
since
yesterday
,
whether
I
be
act
wisely
in
conceal
the
fact
of
his
departure
from
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
on
reflection
,
I
still
think
I
be
right
.
<EOS>
the
allusion
in
his
letter
to
the
preparation
make
for
the
expedition
to
Central
America
,
all
show
that
the
leader
of
it
know
it
to
be
dangerous
.
<EOS>
if
the
discovery
of
this
make
me
uneasy
,
what
would
it
make
her
?
<EOS>
It
be
bad
enough
to
feel
that
his
departure
have
deprive
us
of
the
friend
of
all
other
to
whose
devotion
we
could
trust
in
the
hour
of
need
,
if
ever
that
hour
come
and
find
us
helpless
;
but
it
be
far
bad
to
know
that
he
have
go
from
us
to
face
the
peril
of
a
bad
climate
,
a
wild
country
,
and
a
disturb
population
.
<EOS>
surely
it
would
be
a
cruel
candour
to
tell
Laura
this
,
without
a
pressing
and
a
positive
necessity
for
it
?
  
<EOS>
I
almost
doubt
whether
I
ought
not
to
go
a
step
farther
,
and
burn
the
letter
at
once
,
for
fear
of
its
one
day
fall
into
wrong
hand
.
<EOS>
It
not
only
refer
to
Laura
in
term
which
ought
to
remain
a
secret
for
ever
between
the
writer
and
me
,
but
it
reiterate
his
suspicion
 
<EOS>
so
obstinate
,
so
unaccountable
,
and
so
alarming
 
that
he
have
be
secretly
watch
since
he
leave
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
He
declare
that
he
see
the
face
of
the
two
strange
man
who
follow
him
about
the
street
of
London
,
watch
him
among
the
crowd
which
gather
at
Liverpool
to
see
the
expedition
embark
,
and
he
positively
assert
that
he
hear
the
name
of
Anne
Catherick
pronounce
behind
him
as
he
get
into
the
boat
.
<EOS>
His
own
word
be
,
"
these
event
have
a
meaning
,
these
event
must
lead
to
a
result
.
<EOS>
the
mystery
of
Anne
Catherick
be
not
clear
up
yet
.
<EOS>
She
may
never
cross
my
path
again
,
but
if
ever
she
cross
yours
,
make
well
use
of
the
opportunity
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
than
I
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
speak
on
strong
conviction
 
<EOS>
I
entreat
you
to
remember
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
these
be
his
own
expression
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
danger
of
my
forget
them
 
my
memory
be
only
too
ready
to
dwell
on
any
word
of
Hartright
's
that
refer
to
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
danger
in
my
keep
the
letter
.
<EOS>
the
mere
accident
may
place
it
at
the
mercy
of
stranger
.
<EOS>
I
may
fall
ill
 
<EOS>
I
may
die
.
<EOS>
well
to
burn
it
at
once
,
and
have
one
anxiety
the
less
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
burn
.
<EOS>
the
ashe
of
his
farewell
letter
 
the
last
he
may
ever
write
to
me
 
lie
in
a
few
black
fragment
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
be
this
the
sad
end
to
all
that
sad
story
?
<EOS>
oh
,
not
the
end
 
surely
,
surely
not
the
end
already
!
  
<EOS>
29th
.
 
<EOS>
the
preparation
for
the
marriage
have
begin
.
<EOS>
the
dressmaker
have
come
to
receive
her
order
.
<EOS>
Laura
be
perfectly
impassive
,
perfectly
careless
about
the
question
of
all
other
in
which
a
woman
's
personal
interest
be
most
closely
bind
up
.
<EOS>
She
have
leave
it
all
to
the
dressmaker
and
to
me
.
<EOS>
if
poor
Hartright
have
be
the
baronet
,
and
the
husband
of
her
father
's
choice
,
how
differently
she
would
have
behave
!
<EOS>
how
anxious
and
capricious
she
would
have
be
,
and
what
a
hard
task
the
good
of
dressmaker
would
have
find
it
to
please
her
!
  
<EOS>
30th
.
 
<EOS>
We
hear
every
day
from
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
the
last
news
be
that
the
alteration
in
his
house
will
occupy
from
four
to
six
month
before
they
can
be
properly
complete
.
<EOS>
if
painter
,
paperhanger
,
and
upholsterer
could
make
happiness
as
well
as
splendour
,
I
should
be
interested
about
their
proceeding
in
Laura
's
future
home
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
the
only
part
of
Sir
Percival
's
last
letter
which
do
not
leave
me
as
it
find
me
,
perfectly
indifferent
to
all
his
plan
and
project
,
be
the
part
which
refer
to
the
wedding
tour
.
<EOS>
He
propose
,
as
Laura
be
delicate
,
and
as
the
winter
threaten
to
be
unusually
severe
,
to
take
her
to
Rome
,
and
to
remain
in
Italy
until
the
early
part
of
next
summer
.
<EOS>
if
this
plan
should
not
be
approve
,
he
be
equally
ready
,
although
he
have
no
establishment
of
his
own
in
town
,
to
spend
the
season
in
London
,
in
the
most
suitable
furnished
house
that
can
be
obtain
for
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
put
myself
and
my
own
feeling
entirely
out
of
the
question
(
which
it
be
my
duty
to
do
,
and
which
I
have
do
)
,
I
,
for
one
,
have
no
doubt
of
the
propriety
of
adopt
the
first
of
these
proposal
.
<EOS>
in
either
case
a
separation
between
Laura
and
me
be
inevitable
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
long
separation
,
in
the
event
of
their
go
abroad
,
than
it
would
be
in
the
event
of
their
remain
in
London
 
<EOS>
but
we
must
set
against
this
disadvantage
the
benefit
to
Laura
,
on
the
other
side
,
of
pass
the
winter
in
a
mild
climate
,
and
more
than
that
,
the
immense
assistance
in
raise
her
spirit
,
and
reconcile
her
to
her
new
existence
,
which
the
mere
wonder
and
excitement
of
travel
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
in
the
most
interesting
country
in
the
world
,
must
surely
afford
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
of
a
disposition
to
find
resource
in
the
conventional
gaiety
and
excitement
of
London
.
<EOS>
They
would
only
make
the
first
oppression
of
this
lamentable
marriage
fall
the
heavy
on
her
.
<EOS>
I
dread
the
beginning
of
her
new
life
more
than
word
can
tell
,
but
I
see
some
hope
for
her
if
she
travel
 
none
if
she
remain
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
strange
to
look
back
at
this
late
entry
in
my
journal
,
and
to
find
that
I
be
write
of
the
marriage
and
the
parting
with
Laura
,
as
people
write
of
a
settle
thing
.
<EOS>
It
seem
so
cold
and
so
unfeele
to
be
look
at
the
future
already
in
this
cruelly
compose
way
.
<EOS>
but
what
other
way
be
possible
,
now
that
the
time
be
draw
so
near
?
<EOS>
before
another
month
be
over
our
head
she
will
be
his
Laura
instead
of
mine
!
<EOS>
his
Laura
!
<EOS>
I
be
as
little
able
to
realise
the
idea
which
those
two
word
convey
 
<EOS>
my
mind
feel
almost
as
dull
and
stun
by
it
 
as
if
writing
of
her
marriage
be
like
write
of
her
death
.
  
<EOS>
December
1st
.
 
<EOS>
a
sad
,
sad
day
 
a
day
that
I
have
no
heart
to
describe
at
any
length
.
<EOS>
after
weakly
put
it
off
last
night
,
I
be
oblige
to
speak
to
her
this
morning
of
Sir
Percival
's
proposal
about
the
wedding
tour
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
full
conviction
that
I
should
be
with
her
wherever
she
go
,
the
poor
child
 
for
a
child
<EOS>
she
be
still
in
many
thing
 
be
almost
happy
at
the
prospect
of
see
the
wonder
of
Florence
and
Rome
and
Naples
.
<EOS>
It
nearly
break
my
heart
to
dispel
her
delusion
,
and
to
bring
her
face
to
face
with
the
hard
truth
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
tell
her
that
no
man
tolerate
a
rival
 
not
even
a
woman
rival
 
in
his
wife
's
affection
,
when
he
first
marry
,
whatever
he
may
do
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
warn
her
that
my
chance
of
live
with
her
permanently
under
her
own
roof
,
depend
entirely
on
my
not
arouse
Sir
Percival
's
jealousy
and
distrust
by
stand
between
them
at
the
beginning
of
their
marriage
,
in
the
position
of
the
choose
depositary
of
his
wife
's
close
secret
.
<EOS>
drop
by
drop
<EOS>
I
pour
the
profane
bitterness
of
this
world
's
wisdom
into
that
pure
heart
and
that
innocent
mind
,
while
every
high
and
well
feeling
within
me
recoil
from
my
miserable
task
.
<EOS>
It
be
over
now
.
<EOS>
She
have
learn
her
hard
,
her
inevitable
lesson
.
<EOS>
the
simple
illusion
of
her
girlhood
be
go
,
and
my
hand
have
strip
them
off
.
<EOS>
better
mine
than
his
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
my
consolation
 
well
mine
than
his
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
first
proposal
be
the
proposal
accept
.
<EOS>
They
be
to
go
to
Italy
,
and
I
be
to
arrange
,
with
Sir
Percival
's
permission
,
for
meet
them
and
stay
with
them
when
they
return
to
England
.
<EOS>
in
other
word
,
I
be
to
ask
a
personal
favour
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
and
to
ask
it
of
the
man
of
all
other
to
whom
I
least
desire
to
owe
a
serious
obligation
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
do
even
more
than
that
,
for
Laura
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
2nd
.
 
<EOS>
on
look
back
,
I
find
myself
always
refer
to
Sir
Percival
in
disparage
term
.
<EOS>
in
the
turn
affair
have
now
take
.
<EOS>
I
must
and
will
root
out
my
prejudice
against
him
,
I
can
not
think
how
it
first
get
into
my
mind
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
never
exist
in
former
time
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
Laura
's
reluctance
to
become
his
wife
that
have
set
me
against
him
?
<EOS>
have
Hartright
's
perfectly
intelligible
prejudice
infect
me
without
my
suspect
their
influence
?
<EOS>
do
that
letter
of
Anne
Catherick
's
still
leave
a
lurking
distrust
in
my
mind
,
in
spite
of
Sir
Percival
's
explanation
,
and
of
the
proof
in
my
possession
of
the
truth
of
it
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
account
for
the
state
of
my
own
feeling
;
the
one
thing
I
be
certain
of
be
,
that
it
be
my
duty
 
<EOS>
doubly
my
duty
now
 
not
to
wrong
Sir
Percival
by
unjustly
distrust
him
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
get
to
be
a
habit
with
me
always
to
write
of
him
in
the
same
unfavourable
manner
,
I
must
and
will
break
myself
of
this
unworthy
tendency
,
even
though
the
effort
should
force
me
to
close
the
page
of
my
journal
till
the
marriage
be
over
!
<EOS>
I
be
seriously
dissatisfied
with
myself
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
no
more
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
December
16th
.
 
<EOS>
a
whole
fortnight
have
pass
,
and
I
have
not
once
open
these
page
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
long
enough
away
from
my
journal
to
come
back
to
it
with
a
healthy
and
well
mind
,
I
hope
,
so
far
as
Sir
Percival
be
concern
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
to
record
of
the
past
two
week
.
<EOS>
the
dress
be
almost
all
finish
,
and
the
new
travel
trunk
have
be
send
here
from
London
.
<EOS>
poor
dear
Laura
hardly
leave
me
for
a
moment
all
day
,
and
<EOS>
last
night
,
when
neither
of
us
could
sleep
,
she
come
and
creep
into
my
bed
to
talk
to
me
there
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
lose
you
so
soon
,
Marian
,
"
she
say
;
"
I
must
make
the
most
of
you
while
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
to
be
marry
at
Limmeridge
Church
,
and
thank
Heaven
,
not
one
of
the
neighbour
be
to
be
invite
to
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
the
only
visitor
will
be
our
old
friend
,
Mr.
Arnold
,
who
be
to
come
from
Polesdean
to
give
Laura
away
,
her
uncle
be
far
too
delicate
to
trust
himself
outside
the
door
in
such
inclement
weather
as
we
now
have
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
not
determine
,
from
this
day
forth
,
to
see
nothing
but
the
bright
side
of
our
prospect
,
the
melancholy
absence
of
any
male
relative
of
Laura
's
,
at
the
most
important
moment
of
her
life
,
would
make
me
very
gloomy
and
very
distrustful
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
do
with
gloom
and
distrust
 
that
be
to
say
,
I
have
do
with
write
about
either
the
one
or
the
other
in
this
journal
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
be
to
arrive
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
offer
,
in
case
we
wish
to
treat
him
on
term
of
rigid
etiquette
,
to
write
and
ask
our
clergyman
to
grant
him
the
hospitality
of
the
rectory
,
during
the
short
period
of
his
sojourn
at
Limmeridge
,
before
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
under
the
circumstance
,
neither
Mr.
Fairlie
nor
I
think
it
at
all
necessary
for
us
to
trouble
ourselves
about
attend
to
trifle
form
and
ceremony
.
<EOS>
in
our
wild
moorland
country
,
and
in
this
great
lonely
house
,
we
may
well
claim
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
the
trivial
conventionality
which
hamper
people
in
other
place
.
<EOS>
I
write
to
Sir
Percival
to
thank
him
for
his
polite
offer
,
and
to
beg
that
he
would
occupy
his
old
room
,
just
as
usual
,
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
17th
.
 
<EOS>
He
arrive
to
-
day
,
look
,
as
I
think
,
a
little
worn
and
anxious
,
but
still
talk
and
laugh
like
a
man
in
the
good
possible
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
bring
with
him
some
really
beautiful
present
in
jewellery
,
which
Laura
receive
with
her
good
grace
,
and
,
outwardly
at
least
,
with
perfect
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
the
only
sign
I
can
detect
of
the
struggle
it
must
cost
her
to
preserve
appearance
at
this
try
time
,
express
itself
in
a
sudden
unwillingness
,
on
her
part
,
ever
to
be
leave
alone
.
<EOS>
instead
of
retreat
to
her
own
room
,
as
usual
,
she
seem
to
dread
go
there
.
<EOS>
when
I
go
upstairs
to
-
day
,
after
lunch
,
to
put
on
my
bonnet
for
a
walk
,
she
volunteer
to
join
me
,
and
again
,
before
dinner
,
she
throw
the
door
open
between
our
two
room
,
so
that
we
may
talk
to
each
other
while
we
be
dress
.
<EOS>
"
keep
me
always
do
something
,
"
she
say
;
"
keep
me
always
in
company
with
somebody
.
<EOS>
do
not
let
me
think
 
that
be
all
I
ask
now
,
Marian
 
do
not
let
me
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
sad
change
in
her
only
increase
her
attraction
for
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
He
interpret
it
,
I
can
see
,
to
his
own
advantage
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
feverish
flush
in
her
cheek
,
a
feverish
brightness
in
her
eye
,
which
he
welcome
as
the
return
of
her
beauty
and
the
recovery
of
her
spirit
.
<EOS>
She
talk
to
-
day
at
dinner
with
a
gaiety
and
carelessness
so
false
,
so
shockingly
out
of
her
character
,
that
I
secretly
long
to
silence
her
and
take
her
away
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
delight
and
surprise
appear
to
be
beyond
all
expression
.
<EOS>
the
anxiety
which
I
have
notice
on
his
face
when
he
arrive
totally
disappear
from
it
,
and
he
look
,
even
to
my
eye
,
a
good
ten
year
young
than
he
really
be
.
  
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
doubt
 
though
some
strange
perversity
prevent
me
from
see
it
myself
 
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
Laura
's
future
husband
be
a
very
handsome
man
.
<EOS>
regular
feature
form
a
personal
advantage
to
begin
with
 
and
he
have
them
.
<EOS>
bright
brown
eye
,
either
in
man
or
woman
,
be
a
great
attraction
 
<EOS>
and
he
have
them
.
<EOS>
even
baldness
,
when
it
be
only
baldness
over
the
forehead
(
as
in
his
case
)
,
be
rather
become
than
not
in
a
man
,
for
it
heighten
the
head
and
add
to
the
intelligence
of
the
face
.
<EOS>
grace
and
ease
of
movement
,
untire
animation
of
manner
,
ready
,
pliant
,
conversational
power
 
<EOS>
all
these
be
unquestionable
merit
,
and
all
these
he
certainly
possess
.
<EOS>
surely
Mr.
Gilmore
,
ignorant
as
he
be
of
Laura
's
secret
,
be
not
to
blame
for
feeling
surprised
that
she
should
repent
of
her
marriage
engagement
?
<EOS>
any
one
else
in
his
place
would
have
share
our
good
old
friend
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
ask
,
at
this
moment
,
to
say
plainly
what
defect
I
have
discover
in
Sir
Percival
,
I
could
only
point
out
two
.
<EOS>
one
,
his
incessant
restlessness
and
excitability
 
<EOS>
which
may
be
cause
,
naturally
enough
,
by
unusual
energy
of
character
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
his
short
,
sharp
,
ill
-
temper
manner
of
speak
to
the
servant
 
which
may
be
only
a
bad
habit
after
all
.
<EOS>
no
,
I
can
not
dispute
it
,
and
I
will
not
dispute
it
 
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
be
a
very
handsome
and
a
very
agreeable
man
.
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
I
have
write
it
down
at
last
,
and
I
be
glad
it
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
18th
.
 
<EOS>
feel
weary
and
depressed
this
morning
,
I
leave
Laura
with
Mrs.
Vesey
,
and
go
out
alone
for
one
of
my
brisk
midday
walk
,
which
I
have
discontinue
too
much
of
late
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
dry
airy
road
over
the
moor
that
lead
to
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
after
have
be
out
half
an
hour
,
I
be
excessively
surprised
to
see
Sir
Percival
approach
me
from
the
direction
of
the
farm
.
<EOS>
He
be
walk
rapidly
,
swinge
his
stick
,
his
head
erect
as
usual
,
and
his
shooting
jacket
fly
open
in
the
wind
.
<EOS>
when
we
meet
he
do
not
wait
for
me
to
ask
any
question
 
he
tell
me
at
once
that
he
have
be
to
the
farm
to
inquire
if
Mr.
or
Mrs.
Todd
have
receive
any
tiding
,
since
his
last
visit
to
Limmeridge
,
of
Anne
Catherick
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
find
,
of
course
,
that
they
have
hear
nothing
?
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
whatever
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
be
seriously
afraid
that
we
have
lose
her
.
<EOS>
do
you
happen
to
know
,
"
he
continue
,
look
me
in
the
face
very
attentively
"
if
the
artist
 
Mr.
Hartright
 
be
in
a
position
to
give
us
any
further
information
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
neither
hear
of
her
,
nor
see
her
,
since
he
leave
Cumberland
,
"
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
sad
,
"
say
Sir
Percival
,
speak
like
a
man
who
be
disappoint
,
and
yet
,
oddly
enough
,
look
at
the
same
time
like
a
man
who
be
relieve
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
say
what
misfortune
may
not
have
happen
to
the
miserable
creature
.
<EOS>
I
be
inexpressibly
annoy
at
the
failure
of
all
my
effort
to
restore
her
to
the
care
and
protection
which
she
so
urgently
need
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
time
he
really
look
annoyed
.
<EOS>
I
say
a
few
sympathise
word
,
and
we
then
talk
of
other
subject
on
our
way
back
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
surely
my
chance
meet
with
him
on
the
moor
have
disclose
another
favourable
trait
in
his
character
?
<EOS>
surely
it
be
singularly
considerate
and
unselfish
of
him
to
think
of
Anne
Catherick
on
the
eve
of
his
marriage
,
and
to
go
all
the
way
to
Todd
's
Corner
to
make
inquiry
about
her
,
when
he
may
have
pass
the
time
so
much
more
agreeably
in
Laura
's
society
?
<EOS>
consider
that
he
can
only
have
act
from
motive
of
pure
charity
,
his
conduct
,
under
the
circumstance
,
show
unusual
good
feeling
and
deserve
extraordinary
praise
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
give
him
extraordinary
praise
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
19th
.
 
<EOS>
More
discovery
in
the
inexhaustible
mine
of
Sir
Percival
's
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
to
-
day
I
approach
the
subject
of
my
propose
sojourn
under
his
wife
's
roof
when
he
bring
her
back
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
drop
my
first
hint
in
this
direction
before
he
catch
me
warmly
by
the
hand
,
and
say
I
have
make
the
very
offer
to
him
which
he
have
be
,
on
his
side
,
most
anxious
to
make
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
companion
of
all
other
whom
he
most
sincerely
long
to
secure
for
his
wife
,
and
he
beg
me
to
believe
that
I
have
confer
a
last
favour
on
him
by
make
the
proposal
to
live
with
Laura
after
her
marriage
,
exactly
as
I
have
always
live
with
her
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
thank
him
in
her
name
and
mine
for
his
considerate
kindness
to
both
of
us
,
we
pass
next
to
the
subject
of
his
wedding
tour
,
and
begin
to
talk
of
the
english
society
in
Rome
to
which
Laura
be
to
be
introduce
.
<EOS>
He
run
over
the
name
of
several
friend
whom
he
expect
to
meet
abroad
this
winter
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
English
,
as
well
as
I
can
remember
,
with
one
exception
.
<EOS>
the
one
exception
be
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
the
mention
of
the
Count
's
name
,
and
the
discovery
that
he
and
his
wife
be
likely
to
meet
the
bride
and
bridegroom
on
the
continent
,
put
Laura
's
marriage
,
for
the
first
time
,
in
a
distinctly
favourable
light
.
<EOS>
It
be
likely
to
be
the
mean
of
heal
a
family
feud
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
Madame
Fosco
have
choose
to
forget
her
obligation
as
Laura
's
aunt
out
of
sheer
spite
against
the
late
Mr.
Fairlie
for
his
conduct
in
the
affair
of
the
legacy
.
<EOS>
now
however
,
she
can
persist
in
this
course
of
conduct
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
and
Count
Fosco
be
old
and
fast
friend
,
and
their
wife
will
have
no
choice
but
to
meet
on
civil
term
.
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
in
her
maiden
day
be
one
of
the
most
impertinent
woman
I
ever
meet
with
 
capricious
,
exact
,
and
vain
to
the
last
degree
of
absurdity
.
<EOS>
if
her
husband
have
succeed
in
bring
her
to
her
sense
,
he
deserve
the
gratitude
of
every
member
of
the
family
,
and
he
may
have
mine
to
begin
with
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
become
anxious
to
know
the
Count
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
most
intimate
friend
of
Laura
's
husband
,
and
in
that
capacity
he
excite
my
strong
interest
.
<EOS>
neither
Laura
nor
I
have
ever
see
him
.
<EOS>
all
I
know
of
him
be
that
his
accidental
presence
,
year
ago
,
on
the
step
of
the
Trinita
del
Monte
at
Rome
,
assist
Sir
Percival
's
escape
from
robbery
and
assassination
at
the
critical
moment
when
he
be
wound
in
the
hand
,
and
may
the
next
instant
have
be
wound
in
the
heart
.
<EOS>
I
remember
also
that
,
at
the
time
of
the
late
Mr.
Fairlie
's
absurd
objection
to
his
sister
's
marriage
,
the
Count
write
him
a
very
temperate
and
sensible
letter
on
the
subject
,
which
,
I
be
ashamed
to
say
,
remain
unanswered
.
<EOS>
this
be
all
I
know
of
Sir
Percival
's
friend
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
he
will
ever
come
to
England
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
I
shall
like
him
?
  
<EOS>
My
pen
be
run
away
into
mere
speculation
.
<EOS>
let
me
return
to
sober
matter
of
fact
.
<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
Sir
Percival
's
reception
of
my
venturesome
proposal
to
live
with
his
wife
be
more
than
kind
,
it
be
almost
affectionate
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
Laura
's
husband
will
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
me
if
I
can
only
go
on
as
I
have
begin
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
declare
him
to
be
handsome
,
agreeable
,
full
of
good
feeling
towards
the
unfortunate
and
full
of
affectionate
kindness
towards
me
.
<EOS>
really
,
I
hardly
know
myself
again
,
in
my
new
character
of
Sir
Percival
's
warm
friend
.
  
<EOS>
20th
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
Sir
Percival
!
<EOS>
I
flatly
deny
his
good
look
.
<EOS>
I
consider
him
to
be
eminently
ill
-
tempered
and
disagreeable
,
and
totally
want
in
kindness
and
good
feeling
.
<EOS>
last
night
the
card
for
the
married
couple
be
send
home
.
<EOS>
Laura
open
the
packet
and
see
her
future
name
in
print
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
look
over
her
shoulder
familiarly
at
the
new
card
which
have
already
transform
Miss
Fairlie
into
Lady
Glyde
 
smile
with
the
most
odious
self
-
complacency
,
and
whisper
something
in
her
ear
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
it
be
 
<EOS>
Laura
have
refuse
to
tell
me
 
<EOS>
but
I
see
her
face
turn
to
such
a
deadly
whiteness
that
I
think
she
would
have
faint
.
<EOS>
He
take
no
notice
of
the
change
 
he
seem
to
be
barbarously
unconscious
that
he
have
say
anything
to
pain
her
.
<EOS>
all
my
old
feeling
of
hostility
towards
him
revive
on
the
instant
,
and
all
the
hour
that
have
pass
since
have
do
nothing
to
dissipate
them
.
<EOS>
I
be
more
unreasonable
and
more
unjust
than
ever
.
<EOS>
in
three
word
 
how
glibly
my
pen
write
them
!
 
<EOS>
in
three
word
,
I
hate
him
.
  
<EOS>
21st
.
 
<EOS>
have
the
anxiety
of
this
anxious
time
shake
me
a
little
,
at
last
?
<EOS>
I
have
be
write
,
for
the
last
few
day
,
in
a
tone
of
levity
which
,
Heaven
know
,
be
far
enough
from
my
heart
,
and
which
it
have
rather
shock
me
to
discover
on
look
back
at
the
entry
in
my
journal
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
have
catch
the
feverish
excitement
of
Laura
's
spirit
for
the
last
week
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
the
fit
have
already
pass
away
from
me
,
and
have
leave
me
in
a
very
strange
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
a
persistent
idea
have
be
force
itself
on
my
attention
,
ever
since
last
night
,
that
something
will
yet
happen
to
prevent
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
what
have
produce
this
singular
fancy
?
<EOS>
be
it
the
indirect
result
of
my
apprehension
for
Laura
's
future
?
<EOS>
or
have
it
be
unconsciously
suggest
to
me
by
the
increase
restlessness
and
irritability
which
I
have
certainly
observe
in
Sir
Percival
's
manner
as
the
wedding
-
day
draw
nearer
and
nearer
?
<EOS>
impossible
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
have
the
idea
 
surely
the
wild
idea
,
<EOS>
under
the
circumstance
,
that
ever
enter
a
woman
's
head
?
 
<EOS>
but
try
as
I
may
,
I
can
not
trace
it
back
to
its
source
.
  
<EOS>
this
last
day
have
be
all
confusion
and
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
how
can
I
write
about
it
?
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
I
must
write
.
<EOS>
anything
be
well
than
brood
over
my
own
gloomy
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Kind
Mrs.
Vesey
,
whom
we
have
all
too
much
overlooked
and
forget
of
late
,
innocently
cause
us
a
sad
morning
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
,
for
month
past
,
secretly
make
a
warm
Shetland
shawl
for
her
dear
pupil
 
a
most
beautiful
and
surprising
piece
of
work
to
be
do
by
a
woman
at
her
age
and
with
her
habit
.
<EOS>
the
gift
be
present
this
morning
,
and
poor
warm
-
hearted
Laura
completely
break
down
when
the
shawl
be
put
proudly
on
her
shoulder
by
the
loving
old
friend
and
guardian
of
her
motherless
childhood
.
<EOS>
I
be
hardly
allow
time
to
quiet
them
both
,
or
even
to
dry
my
own
eye
,
when
I
be
send
for
by
Mr.
Fairlie
,
to
be
favour
with
a
long
recital
of
his
arrangement
for
the
preservation
of
his
own
tranquillity
on
the
wedding
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Laura
"
be
to
receive
his
present
 
<EOS>
a
shabby
ring
,
with
her
affectionate
uncle
's
hair
for
an
ornament
,
instead
of
a
precious
stone
,
and
with
a
heartless
french
inscription
inside
,
about
congenial
sentiment
and
eternal
friendship
 
<EOS>
"
dear
Laura
"
be
to
receive
this
tender
tribute
from
my
hand
immediately
,
so
that
she
may
have
plenty
of
time
to
recover
from
the
agitation
produce
by
the
gift
before
she
appear
in
Mr.
Fairlie
's
presence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Laura

be
to

<EOS>
"
I
be
so
exasperate
by
this
miserable
selfish
trifling
,
at
such
a
time
,
that
I
should
certainly
have
shock
Mr.
Fairlie
by
some
of
the
hard
and
rudest
truth
he
have
ever
hear
in
his
life
,
if
the
arrival
of
Mr.
Arnold
from
Polesdean
have
not
call
me
away
to
new
duty
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
day
be
indescribable
.
<EOS>
I
believe
no
one
in
the
house
really
know
how
it
pass
.
<EOS>
the
confusion
of
small
event
,
all
huddle
together
one
on
the
other
,
bewilder
everybody
.
<EOS>
there
be
dress
send
home
that
have
be
forget
 
there
be
trunk
to
be
pack
and
unpack
and
pack
again
 
there
be
present
from
friend
far
and
near
,
friend
high
and
low
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
needlessly
hurried
,
all
nervously
expectant
of
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
,
especially
,
be
too
restless
now
to
remain
five
minute
together
in
the
same
place
.
<EOS>
that
short
,
sharp
cough
of
his
trouble
him
more
than
ever
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
and
out
of
door
all
day
long
,
and
he
seem
to
grow
so
inquisitive
on
a
sudden
,
that
he
question
the
very
stranger
who
come
on
small
errand
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
add
to
all
this
,
the
one
perpetual
thought
in
Laura
's
mind
and
mine
,
that
we
be
to
part
the
next
day
,
and
the
haunting
dread
,
unexpresse
by
either
of
us
,
and
yet
ever
present
to
both
,
that
this
deplorable
marriage
may
prove
to
be
the
one
fatal
error
of
her
life
and
the
one
hopeless
sorrow
of
mine
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
in
all
the
year
of
our
close
and
happy
intercourse
we
almost
avoid
look
each
other
in
the
face
,
and
we
refrain
,
by
common
consent
,
from
speak
together
in
private
through
the
whole
evening
.
<EOS>
I
can
dwell
on
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
whatever
future
sorrow
may
be
in
store
for
me
,
I
shall
always
look
back
on
this
twenty
-
first
of
December
as
the
most
comfortless
and
most
miserable
day
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
write
these
line
in
the
solitude
of
my
own
room
,
long
after
midnight
,
have
just
come
back
from
a
steal
look
at
Laura
in
her
pretty
little
white
bed
 
<EOS>
the
bed
she
have
occupy
since
the
day
of
her
girlhood
.
  
<EOS>
there
she
lie
,
unconscious
that
I
be
look
at
her
 
quiet
,
more
quiet
than
I
have
dare
to
hope
,
but
not
sleep
.
<EOS>
the
glimmer
of
the
night
-
light
show
me
that
her
eye
be
only
partially
close
 
the
trace
of
tear
glisten
between
her
eyelid
.
<EOS>
My
little
keepsake
 
only
a
brooch
 
lie
on
the
table
at
her
bedside
,
with
her
prayer
-
book
,
and
the
miniature
portrait
of
her
father
which
she
take
with
her
wherever
she
go
.
<EOS>
I
wait
a
moment
,
look
at
her
from
behind
her
pillow
,
as
she
lie
beneath
me
,
with
one
arm
and
hand
rest
on
the
white
coverlid
,
so
still
,
so
quietly
breathe
,
that
the
frill
on
her
night
-
dress
never
move
 
<EOS>
I
wait
,
look
at
her
,
as
I
have
see
her
thousand
of
time
,
as
I
shall
never
see
her
again
 
and
then
steal
back
to
my
room
.
<EOS>
My
own
love

<EOS>
with
all
your
wealth

and
all
your
beauty

how
friendless
you
be

one
man

would
give
his
heart
's
life
to
serve
you
be
far
away

this
stormy
night

awful

who
else
be
leave
to
you

<EOS>
no
father
,
no
brother
 
no
live
creature
but
the
helpless
,
useless
woman
who
write
these
sad
line
,
and
watch
by
you
for
the
morning
,
in
sorrow
that
she
can
not
compose
,
in
doubt
that
she
can
not
conquer
.
<EOS>

what
a

for
her
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
be
ready
to
be
happy
anywhere
in
her
society
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
,
therefore
,
well
contented
in
our
various
way
,
to
begin
with
.
  
<EOS>
last
night
I
sleep
in
London
,
and
be
delay
there
so
long
to
-
day
by
various
call
and
commission
,
that
I
do
not
reach
Blackwater
this
evening
till
after
dusk
.
  
<EOS>
judge
by
my
vague
impression
of
the
place
thus
far
,
it
be
the
exact
opposite
of
Limmeridge
.
  
<EOS>
the
house
be
situate
on
a
dead
flat
,
and
seem
to
be
shut
in
 
almost
suffocate
,
to
my
north
-
country
notion
,
by
tree
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
nobody
but
the
man
-
servant
who
open
the
door
to
me
,
and
the
housekeeper
,
a
very
civil
person
,
who
show
me
the
way
to
my
own
room
,
and
get
me
my
tea
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
nice
little
boudoir
and
bedroom
,
at
the
end
of
a
long
passage
on
the
first
floor
.
<EOS>
the
servant
and
some
of
the
spare
room
be
on
the
second
floor
,
and
all
the
live
room
be
on
the
ground
floor
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
one
of
them
yet
,
and
I
know
nothing
about
the
house
,
except
that
one
wing
of
it
be
say
to
be
five
hundred
year
old
,
that
it
have
a
moat
round
it
once
,
and
that
it
get
its
name
of
Blackwater
from
a
lake
in
the
park
.
  
<EOS>
eleven
o'clock
have
just
strike
,
in
a
ghostly
and
solemn
manner
,
from
a
turret
over
the
centre
of
the
house
,
which
I
see
when
I
come
in
.
<EOS>
a
large
dog
have
be
wake
,
apparently
by
the
sound
of
the
bell
,
and
be
howl
and
yawn
drearily
,
somewhere
round
a
corner
.
<EOS>
I
hear
echo
footstep
in
the
passage
below
,
and
the
iron
thumping
of
bolt
and
bar
at
the
house
door
.
<EOS>
the
servant
be
evidently
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
follow
their
example
?
  
<EOS>
no
,
I
be
not
half
sleepy
enough
.
<EOS>
Sleepy
,
do
I
say
?
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
should
never
close
my
eye
again
.
<EOS>
the
bare
anticipation
of
see
that
dear
face
,
and
hear
that
well
-
know
voice
to
-
morrow
,
keep
me
in
a
perpetual
fever
of
excitement
.
<EOS>
if
I
only
have
the
privilege
of
a
man
,
I
would
order
out
Sir
Percival
's
good
horse
instantly
,
and
tear
away
on
a
night
-
gallop
,
eastward
,
to
meet
the
rise
sun
 
a
long
,
hard
,
heavy
,
ceaseless
gallop
of
hour
and
hour
,
like
the
famous
highwayman
's
ride
to
York
.
<EOS>
being
,
however
,
nothing
but
a
woman
,
condemn
to
patience
,
propriety
,
and
petticoat
for
life
,
I
must
respect
the
house
-
keeper
's
opinion
,
and
try
to
compose
myself
in
some
feeble
and
feminine
way
.
  
<EOS>
reading
be
out
of
the
question
 
I
can
not
fix
my
attention
on
book
.
<EOS>
let
me
try
if
I
can
write
myself
into
sleepiness
and
fatigue
.
<EOS>
My
journal
have
be
very
much
neglect
of
late
.
<EOS>
what
can
I
recall
 
standing
,
as
I
now
do
,
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
life
 
of
person
and
event
,
of
chance
and
change
,
during
the
past
six
month
 
the
long
,
weary
,
empty
interval
since
Laura
's
wedding
-
day
?
  
<EOS>
Walter
Hartright
be
uppermost
in
my
memory
,
and
he
pass
first
in
the
shadowy
procession
of
my
absent
friend
.
<EOS>
I
receive
a
few
line
from
him
,
after
the
landing
of
the
expedition
in
Honduras
,
write
more
cheerfully
and
hopefully
than
he
have
write
yet
.
<EOS>
a
month
or
six
week
later
I
see
an
extract
from
an
american
newspaper
,
describe
the
departure
of
the
adventurer
on
their
inland
journey
.
<EOS>
They
be
last
see
enter
a
wild
primeval
forest
,
each
man
with
his
rifle
on
his
shoulder
and
his
baggage
at
his
back
.
<EOS>
since
that
time
,
civilisation
have
lose
all
trace
of
them
.
<EOS>
not
a
line
more
have
I
receive
from
Walter
,
not
a
fragment
of
news
from
the
expedition
have
appear
in
any
of
the
public
journal
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
dense
,
dishearten
obscurity
hang
over
the
fate
and
fortune
of
Anne
Catherick
,
and
her
companion
,
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
nothing
whatever
have
be
hear
of
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
whether
they
be
in
the
country
or
out
of
it
,
whether
they
be
live
or
dead
,
no
one
know
.
<EOS>
even
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
have
lose
all
hope

and
have
order
the
useless
search
after
the
fugitive
to

Our
good
old
friend
Mr.
Gilmore
have
meet
with
a
sad
check
in
his
active
professional
career
.
<EOS>
early
in
the
spring
we
be
alarm
by
hear
that
he
have
be
find
insensible
at
his
desk
,
and
that
the
seizure
be
pronounce
to
be
an
apoplectic
fit
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
long
complain
of
fulness
and
oppression
in
the
head
,
and
his
doctor
have
warn
him
of
the
consequence
that
would
follow
his
persistency
in
continue
to
work
,
early
and
late
,
as
if
he
be
still
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
the
result
now
be
that
he
have
be
positively
order
to
keep
out
of
his
office
for
a
year
to
come
,
at
least
,
and
to
seek
repose
of
body
and
relief
of
mind
by
altogether
change
his
usual
mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
the
business
be
leave
,
accordingly
,
to
be
carry
on
by
his
partner
,
and
he
be
himself
,
at
this
moment
,
away
in
Germany
,
visit
some
relation
who
be
settle
there
in
mercantile
pursuit
.
<EOS>
thus
another
true
friend
and
trustworthy
adviser
be
lose
to
us
 
<EOS>
lose
,
I
earnestly
hope
and
trust
,
for
a

Poor
Mrs.
Vesey
travel
with
me
as
far
as
London
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
abandon
her
to
solitude
at
Limmeridge
after
Laura
<EOS>
and
I
have
both
leave
the
house
,
and
we
have
arrange
that
she
be
to
live
with
an
unmarried
young
sister

hers
,
who

a
school
at
Clapham

<EOS>
She
be
to
come
here
this
autumn
to
visit
her
pupil
 
<EOS>
I
may
almost
say
her
adopted
child
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
good

lady
safe

her
destination

leave
her

Laura
again
in

time

<EOS>
as
for
Mr.
Fairlie

I
believe
I
be
guilty
of
no
injustice
if
I
describe
him
as
be
unutterably

the
house

<EOS>
the
idea
of
his

simply
preposterous
 
<EOS>
he
use
to
let
month
pass
in
the
old
time
without

her
 
and
in
my
case
and
Mrs.

I
take

to
be
equivalent
to
a
confession

so

Laura
have
be

to

all
the

<EOS>
what
can
I
recall
of
her
during
the
past
six
month
,
before
I
close
my
journal
for
the
night
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
her
letter
to
guide
me
,
and
on
the
most
important
of
all
the
question
which
our
correspondence
can
discuss
,
every
one
of
those
letter
leave
me
in

<EOS>
do
he
treat
her
kindly
?
<EOS>
be
she
happy
now
than
she
be
when
I
part
with
her
on
the
wedding
-
day
?
<EOS>
all
my
letter
have
contain
these
two
inquiry
,
put
more
or
less
directly
,
now
in
one
form
,
and
now
in
another
,
and
all
,
on
that
point
only
,
have
remain
without
reply
,
or
have
be
answer
as
if
my
question
merely
relate
to
the
state
of
her
health
.
<EOS>
She
inform
me
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
she
be
perfectly
well
 
that
travel
agree
with
her
 
that
she
be
get
through
the
winter
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
without
catch
cold
 
but
not
a
word
<EOS>
can
I
find
anywhere
which
tell
me
plainly
that
she
be
reconcile
to
her
marriage
,
and
that
she
can
now
look
back
to
the
twenty
-
second
of
December
without
any
bitter
feeling
of
repentance
and
regret
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
her
husband
be
only
mention
in
her
letter
,
as
she
may
mention
the
name
of
a
friend
who
be
travel
with
them
,
and
who
have
undertake
to
make
all
the
arrangement
for
the
journey
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
"
have
settle
that
we
leave
on
such
a
day
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Percival
"
have
decide
that
we
travel
by
such
a
road
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
write
"
Percival
"
only
,
but
very
seldom
 
in
nine
case
out
of
ten
she
give
him
his
title
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
find
that
his
habit
and
opinion
have
change
and
colour
her
in
any
single
particular
.
<EOS>
the
usual
moral
transformation
which
be
insensibly
work
in
a
young
,
fresh
,
sensitive
woman
by
her
marriage
,
seem
never
to
have
take
place
in
Laura
.
<EOS>
She
write
of
her
own
thought
and
impression
,
amid
all
the
wonder
she
have
see
,
exactly
as
she
may
have
write
to
some
one
else
,
if
I
have
be
travel
with
her
instead
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
betrayal
anywhere
of
sympathy
of
any
kind
exist
between
them
.
<EOS>
even
when
she
wander
from
the
subject
of
her
travel
,
and
occupy
herself
with
the
prospect
that
await
her
in
England
,
her
speculation
be
busied
with
her
future
as
my
sister
,
and
persistently
neglect
to
notice
her
future
as
Sir
Percival
's
wife
.
<EOS>
in
all
this
there
be
no
undertone
of
complaint
to
warn
me
that
she
be
absolutely
unhappy
in
her
married
life
.
<EOS>
the
impression
I
have
derive
from
our
correspondence
do
not
,
thank
God
,
lead
me
to
any
such
distressing
conclusion
as
that
.
<EOS>
I
only
see
a
sad
torpor
,
an
unchangeable
indifference
,
when
I
turn
my
mind
from
her
in
the
old
character
of
a
sister
,
and
look
at
her
,
through
the
medium
of
her
letter
,
in
the
new
character
of
a
wife
.
<EOS>
in
other
word
,
it
be
always
Laura
Fairlie
who
have
be
write
to
me
for
the
last
six
month
,
and
never
Lady
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
the
strange
silence
which
she
maintain
on
the
subject
of
her
husband
's
character
and
conduct
<EOS>
,
she
preserve
with
almost
equal
resolution
in
the
few
reference
which
her
later
letter
contain
to
the
name
of
her
husband
's
bosom
friend
,
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
for
some
unexplained
reason
the
Count
and
his
wife
appear
to
have
change
their
plan
abruptly
,
at
the
end
of
last
autumn
,
and
to
have
go
to
Vienna
instead
of
go
to
Rome
,
<EOS>
at
which
latter
place
Sir
Percival
have
expect
to
find
them
when
he
leave
England
.
<EOS>
They
only
quit
Vienna
in
the
spring
,
and
travel
as
far
as
the
Tyrol
to
meet
the
bride
and
bridegroom
on
their
homeward
journey
.
<EOS>
Laura
write
readily
enough
about
the
meeting
with
Madame
Fosco
,
and
assure
me
that
she
have
find
her
aunt
so
much
change
for
the
well
 
so
much
quieter
,
and
so
much
more
sensible
as
a
wife
than
she
be
as
a
single
woman
 
that
I
shall
hardly
know
her
again
when
I
see
her
here
.
<EOS>
but
on
the
subject
of
Count
Fosco
(
who
interest
me
infinitely
more
than
his
wife
)
,
Laura
be
provokingly
circumspect
and
silent
.
<EOS>
She
only
say
that
he
puzzle
her
,
and
that
she
will
not
tell
me
what
her
impression
of
him
be
until
I
have
see
him
,
and
form
my
own
opinion
first
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
to
my
mind
,
look
ill
for
the
Count
.
<EOS>
Laura
have
preserve
,
far
more
perfectly
than
most
people
do
in
later
life
,
the
child
's
subtle
faculty
of
know
a
friend
by
instinct
,
and
if
I
be
right
in
assume
that
her
first
impression
of
Count
Fosco
have
not
be
favourable
,
I
for
one
am
in
some
danger
of
doubt
and
distrust
that
illustrious
foreigner
before
I
have
so
much
as
set
eye
on
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
patience
,
patience
 
this
uncertainty
,
and
many
uncertainty
more
,
can
not
last
much
longer
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
will
see
all
my
doubt
in
a
fair
way
of
be
clear
up
,
sooner
or
later
.
  
<EOS>
twelve
o'clock
have
strike
,
and
I
have
just
come
back
to
close
these
page
,
after
look
out
at
my
open
window
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
still
,
sultry
,
moonless
night
.
<EOS>
the
star
be
dull
and
few
.
<EOS>
the
tree
that
shut
out
the
view
on
all
side
look
dimly
black
and
solid
in
the
distance
,
like
a
great
wall
of
rock
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
croaking
of
frog
,
faint
and
far
off
,
and
the
echo
of
the
great
clock
hum
in
the
airless
calm
long
after
the
stroke
have
cease
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
Blackwater
Park
will
look
in
the
daytime
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
altogether
like
it
by
night
.
  
<EOS>
12th
.
 
<EOS>
a
day
of
investigation
and
discovery
 
a
more
interesting
day
,
for
many
reason
,
than
I
have
venture
to
anticipate
.
  
<EOS>
I
begin
my
sight
-
see
,
of
course
,
with
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
main
body
of
the
building
be
of
the
time
of
that
highly
-
overrate
woman
,
Queen
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
on
the
ground
floor
there
be
two
hugely
long
gallery
,
with
low
ceiling
lie
parallel
with
each
other
,
and
render
additionally
dark
and
dismal
by
hideous
family
portrait
 
<EOS>
every
one
of
which
I
should
like
to
burn
.
<EOS>
the
room
on
the
floor
above
the
two
gallery
be
keep
in
tolerable
repair
,
but
be
very
seldom
use
.
<EOS>
the
civil
housekeeper
,
who
act
as
my
guide
,
offer
to
show
me
over
them
,
but
considerately
add
that
she
fear
I
should
find
them
rather
out
of
order
.
<EOS>
My
respect
for
the
integrity
of
my
own
petticoat
and
stocking
infinitely
exceed
my
respect
for
all
the
Elizabethan
bedroom
in
the
kingdom
,
so
I
positively
decline
explore
the
upper
region
of
dust
and
dirt
at
the
risk
of
soil
my
nice
clean
clothe
.
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
say
,
"
I
be
quite
of
your
opinion
,
miss
,
"
and
appear
to
think
me
the
most
sensible
woman
she
have
meet
with
for
a
long
time
past
.
  
<EOS>
so
much
,
then
,
for
the
main
building
.
<EOS>
two
wing
be
add
at
either
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
half
-
ruin
wing
on
the
left
(
as
you
approach
the
house
)
be
once
a
place
of
residence
stand
by
itself
,
and
be
build
in
the
fourteenth
century
.
<EOS>
one
of
Sir
Percival
's
maternal
ancestor
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
,
and
do
not
care
which
 
tack
on
the
main
building
,
at
right
angle
to
it
,
in
the
aforesaid
Queen
Elizabeth
's
time
.
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
tell
me
that
the
architecture
of
"
the
old
wing
,
"
both
outside
and
inside
,
be
consider
remarkably
fine
by
good
judge
.
<EOS>
on
further
investigation
I
discover
that
good
judge
could
only
exercise
their
ability
on
Sir
Percival
's
piece
of
antiquity
by
previously
dismissing
from
their
mind
all
fear
of
damp
,
darkness
,
and
rat
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
I
unhesitatingly
acknowledge
myself
to
be
no
judge
at
all
,
and
suggest
that
we
should
treat
"
the
old
wing
"
precisely
as
we
have
previously
treat
the
Elizabethan
bedroom
.
<EOS>
once
more
the
housekeeper
say
,
"
I
be
quite
of
your
opinion
,
miss
,
"
and
once
more
she
look
at
me
with
undisguised
admiration
of
my
extraordinary
common
-
sense
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
next
to
the
wing
on
the
right
,
which
be
build
,
by
way
of
complete
the
wonderful
architectural
jumble
at
Blackwater
Park
,
in
the
time
of
George
the
Second
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
habitable
part
of
the
house
,
which
have
be
repair
and
redecorate
inside
on
Laura
's
account
.
<EOS>
My
two
room
,
and
all
the
good
bedroom
besides
,
be
on
the
first
floor
,
and
the
basement
contain
a
drawing
-
room
,
a
dining
-
room
,
a
morning
-
room
,
a
library
,
and
a
pretty
little
boudoir
for
Laura
,
all
very
nicely
ornament
in
the
bright
modern
way
,
and
all
very
elegantly
furnish
with
the
delightful
modern
luxury
.
<EOS>
none
of
the
room
be
anything
like
so
large
and
airy
as
our
room
at
Limmeridge
,
but
they
all
look
pleasant
to
live
in
.
<EOS>
I
be
terribly
afraid
,
from
what
I
have
hear
of
Blackwater
Park
,
of
fatigue
antique
chair
,
and
dismal
stained
glass
,
and
musty
,
frouzy
hanging
,
and
all
the
barbarous
lumber
which
people
bear
without
a
sense
of
comfort
accumulate
about
them
,
in
defiance
of
the
consideration
due
to
the
convenience
of
their
friend
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
inexpressible
relief
to
find
that
the
nineteenth
century
have
invade
this
strange
future
home
of
mine
,
and
have
sweep
the
dirty
"
good
old
time
"
out
of
the
way
of
our
daily
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
dawdle
away
the
morning
 
part
of
the
time
in
the
room
downstairs
,
and
part
out
of
door
in
the
great
square
which
be
form
by
the
three
side
of
the
house
,
and
by
the
lofty
iron
railing
and
gate
which
protect
it
in
front
.
<EOS>
a
large
circular
fish
-
pond
with
stone
side
,
and
an
allegorical
leaden
monster
in
the
middle
,
occupy
the
centre
of
the
square
.
<EOS>
the
pond
itself
be
full
of
gold
and
silver
fish
,
and
be
encircle
by
a
broad
belt
of
the
soft
turf
I
ever
walk
on
.
<EOS>
I
loiter
here
on
the
shady
side
pleasantly
enough
till
luncheon
-
time
,
and
after
that
take
my
broad
straw
hat
and
wander
out
alone
in
the
warm
lovely
sunlight
to
explore
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Daylight
confirm
the
impression
which
I
have
feel
the
night
before
,
of
there
be
too
many
tree
at
Blackwater
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
stifle
by
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
young
,
and
plant
far
too
thickly
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
there
must
have
be
a
ruinous
cutting
down
of
timber
all
over
the
estate
before
Sir
Percival
's
time
,
and
an
angry
anxiety
on
the
part
of
the
next
possessor
to
fill
up
all
the
gap
as
thickly
and
rapidly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
after
look
about
me
in
front
of
the
house
,
I
observe
a
flower
-
garden
on
my
left
hand
,
and
walk
towards
it
to
see
what
I
could
discover
in
that
direction
.
  
<EOS>
on
a
near
view
the
garden
prove
to
be
small
and
poor
and
ill
keep
.
<EOS>
I
leave
it
behind
me
,
open
a
little
gate
in
a
ring
fence
,
and
find
myself
in
a
plantation
of
fir
-
tree
.
  
<EOS>
a
pretty
winding
path
,
artificially
make
,
lead
me
on
among
the
tree
,
and
my
north
-
country
experience
soon
inform
me
that
I
be
approach
sandy
,
heathy
ground
.
<EOS>
after
a
walk
of
more
than
half
a
mile
,
I
should
think
,
among
the
fir
,
the
path
take
a
sharp
turn
 
the
tree
abruptly
cease
to
appear
on
either
side
of
me
,
and
I
find
myself
stand
suddenly
on
the
margin
of
a
vast
open
space
,
and
look
down
at
the
Blackwater
lake
from
which
the
house
take
its
name
.
  
<EOS>
the
ground
,
shelve
away
below
me
,
be
all
sand
,
with
a
few
little
heathy
hillock
to
break
the
monotony
of
it
in
certain
place
.
<EOS>
the
lake
itself
have
evidently
once
flow
to
the
spot
on
which
I
stand
,
and
have
be
gradually
waste
and
dry
up
to
less
than
a
third
of
its
former
size
.
<EOS>
I
see
its
still
,
stagnant
water
,
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
from
me
in
the
hollow
,
separate
into
pool
and
pond
by
twine
reed
and
rush
,
and
little
knoll
of
earth
.
<EOS>
on
the
farther
bank
from
me
the
tree
rise
thickly
again
,
and
shut
out
the
view
,
and
cast
their
black
shadow
on
the
sluggish
,
shallow
water
.
<EOS>
as
I
walk
down
to
the
lake
,
I
see
that
the
ground
on
its
farth
side
be
damp
and
marshy
,
overgrow
with
rank
grass
and
dismal
willow
.
<EOS>
the
water
,
which
be
clear
enough
on
the
open
sandy
side
,
where
the
sun
shine
,
look
black
and
poisonous
opposite
to
me
,
where
it
lie
deep
under
the
shade
of
the
spongy
bank
,
and
the
rank
overhang
thicket
and
tangle
tree
.
<EOS>
the
frog
be
croak
,
and
the
rat
be
slip
in
and
out
of
the
shadowy
water
,
like
live
shadow
themselves
,
as
I
get
near
to
the
marshy
side
of
the
lake
.
<EOS>
I
see
here
,
lie
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
water
,
the
rotten
wreck
of
an
old
overturn
boat
,
with
a
sickly
spot
of
sunlight
glimmer
through
a
gap
in
the
tree
on
its
dry
surface
,
and
a
snake
basking
in
the
midst
of
the
spot
,
fantastically
coil
and
treacherously
still
.
<EOS>
far
and
near
the
view
suggest
the
same
dreary
impression
of
solitude
and
decay
,
and
the
glorious
brightness
of
the
summer
sky
overhead
seem
only
to
deepen
and
harden
the
gloom
and
barrenness
of
the
wilderness
on
which
it
shine
.
<EOS>
I
turn
and
retrace
my
step
to
the
high
heathy
ground
,
direct
them
a
little
aside
from
my
former
path
towards
a
shabby
old
wooden
shed
,
which
stand
on
the
outer
skirt
of
the
fir
plantation
,
and
which
have
hitherto
be
too
unimportant
to
share
my
notice
with
the
wide
,
wild
prospect
of
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
on
approach
the
shed
I
find
that
it
have
once
be
a
boat
-
house
,
and
that
an
attempt
have
apparently
be
make
to
convert
it
afterwards
into
a
sort
of
rude
arbour
,
by
place
inside
it
a
firwood
seat
,
a
few
stool
,
and
a
table
.
<EOS>
I
enter
the
place
,
and
sit
down
for
a
little
while
to
rest
and
get
my
breath
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
in
the
boat
-
house
more
than
a
minute
when
it
strike
me
that
the
sound
of
my
own
quick
breathing
be
very
strangely
echo
by
something
beneath
me
.
<EOS>
I
listen
intently
for
a
moment
,
and
hear
a
low
,
thick
,
sob
breath
that
seem
to
come
from
the
ground
under
the
seat
which
I
be
occupy
.
<EOS>
My
nerve
be
not
easily
shake
by
trifle
,
but
on
this
occasion
I
start
to
my
foot
in
a
fright
 
call
out
 
receive
no
answer
 
summon
back
my
recreant
courage
,
and
look
under
the
seat
.
  
<EOS>
there
,
crouch
up
in
the
farth
corner
,
lie
the
forlorn
cause
of
my
terror
,
in
the
shape
of
a
poor
little
dog
 
a
black
and
white
spaniel
.
<EOS>
the
creature
moan
feebly
when
I
look
at
it
and
call
to
it
,
but
never
stir
.
<EOS>
I
move
away
the
seat
and
look
closer
.
<EOS>
the
poor
little
dog
's
eye
be
glaze
fast
,
and
there
be
spot
of
blood
on
its
glossy
white
side
.
<EOS>
the
misery
of
a
weak
,
helpless
,
dumb
creature
be
surely
one
of
the
saddest
of
all
the
mournful
sight
which
this
world
can
show
.
<EOS>
I
lift
the
poor
dog
in
my
arm
as
gently
as
I
could
,
and
contrive
a
sort
of
make
-
shift
hammock
for
him
to
lie
in
,
by
gather
up
the
front
of
my
dress
all
round
him
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
I
take
the
creature
,
as
painlessly
as
possible
,
and
as
fast
as
possible
,
back
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
find
no
one
in
the
hall
<EOS>
I
go
up
at
once
to
my
own
sitting
-
room
,
make
a
bed
for
the
dog
with
one
of
my
old
shawl
,
and
ring
the
bell
.
<EOS>
the
large
and
fattest
of
all
possible
house
-
maid
answer
it
,
in
a
state
of
cheerful
stupidity
which
would
have
provoke
the
patience
of
a
saint
.
<EOS>
the
girl
's
fat
,
shapeless
face
actually
stretch
into
a
broad
grin
at
the
sight
of
the
wound
creature
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
see
there
to
laugh
at
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
as
angrily
as
if
she
have
be
a
servant
of
my
own
.
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
whose
dog
it
be
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
miss
,
that
I
certainly
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
She
stoop
,
and
look
down
at
the
spaniel
's
injure
side
 
brighten
suddenly
with
the
irradiation
of
a
new
idea
 
and
point
to
the
wound
with
a
chuckle
of
satisfaction
,
say
,
"
that
be
Baxter
's
doing
,
that
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
exasperate
that
I
could
have
box
her
ear
.
<EOS>
"
baxter
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
the
brute
you
call
Baxter
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
girl
grin
again
more
cheerfully
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
bless
you
,
miss
!
<EOS>
Baxter
be
the
keeper
,
and
<EOS>
when
he
find
strange
dog
hunt
about
,
he
take
and
shoot
'em
.
<EOS>
It
be
keeper
's
dooty
miss
,
I
think
that
dog
will
die
.
<EOS>
here
be
where
he
be
be
shoot
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
that
be
Baxter
's
doing
,
that
be
.
<EOS>
Baxter
's
doing
,
miss
,
and
Baxter
's
dooty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
almost
wicked
enough
to
wish
that
Baxter
have
shoot
the
housemaid
instead
of
the
dog
.
<EOS>
see
that
it
be
quite
useless
to
expect
this
densely
impenetrable
personage
to
give
me
any
help
in
relieve
the
suffering
creature
at
our
foot
,
I
tell
her
to
request
the
housekeeper
's
attendance
with
my
compliment
.
<EOS>
She
go
out
exactly
as
she
have
come
in
,
grin
from
ear
to
ear
.
<EOS>
as
the
door
close
on
her
she
say
to
herself
softly
,
"
It
be
Baxter
's
doing
and
Baxter
's
dooty
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
,
a
person
of
some
education
and
intelligence
,
thoughtfully
bring
upstairs
with
her
some
milk
and
some
warm
water
.
<EOS>
the
instant
she
see
the
dog
on
the
floor
she
start
and
change
colour
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Lord
bless
me
,
"
cry
the
housekeeper
,
"
that
must
be
Mrs.
Catherick
's
dog
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
whose
?
"
I
ask
,
in
the
utmost
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Catherick
's
.
<EOS>
You
seem
to
know
Mrs.
Catherick
,
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
  
"
not
personally
,
but
I
have
hear
of
her
.
<EOS>
do
she
live
here
?
<EOS>
have
she
have
any
news
of
her
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
she
come
here
to
ask
for
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
when
?
"
  
"
only
yesterday
.
<EOS>
She
say
some
one
have
report
that
a
stranger
answer
to
the
description
of
her
daughter
have
be
see
in
our
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
no
such
report
have
reach
us
here
,
and
no
such
report
be
know
in
the
village
,
when
I
send
to
make
inquiry
there
on
Mrs.
Catherick
's
account
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
bring
this
poor
little
dog
with
her
when
she
come
,
and
I
see
it
trot
out
after
her
when
she
go
away
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
creature
stray
into
the
plantation
,
and
get
shoot
.
<EOS>
where
do
you
find
it
,
Miss
Halcombe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
old
shed
that
look
out
on
the
lake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
,
that
be
the
plantation
side
,
and
the
poor
thing
drag
itself
,
I
suppose
,
to
the
near
shelter
,
as
dog
<EOS>
will
,
to
die
.
<EOS>
if
you
can
moisten
its
lip
with
the
milk
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
I
will
wash
the
clot
hair
from
the
wound
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
afraid
it
be
too
late
to
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
can
but
try
.

<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
!
<EOS>
the
name
still
ring
in
my
ear
,
as
if
the
housekeeper
have
only
that
moment
surprise
me
by
utter
it
.
<EOS>
while
we
be
attend
to
the
dog
,
the
word
of
Walter
Hartright
's
caution
to
me
return
to
my
memory
:
"
if
ever
Anne
Catherick
cross
your
path
,
make
well
use
of
the
opportunity
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
than
I
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
finding
of
the
wound
spaniel
have
lead
me
already
to
the
discovery
of
Mrs.
Catherick
's
visit
to
Blackwater
Park
,
and
that
event
may
lead
in
its
turn
,
to
something
more
.
<EOS>
I
determine
to
make
the
most
of
the
chance
which
be
now
offer
to
me
,
and
to
gain
as
much
information
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
say
that
Mrs.
Catherick
live
anywhere
in
this
neighbourhood
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
no
,
"
say
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
She
live
at
Welmingham
,
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
county
 
five
-
and
-
twenty
mile
off
,
at
least
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
know
Mrs.
Catherick
for
some
year
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
I
never
see
her
before
she
come
here
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
her
,
of
course
,
because
I
have
hear
of
Sir
Percival
's
kindness
in
put
her
daughter
under
medical
care
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
be
rather
a
strange
person
in
her
manner
,
but
extremely
respectable
-
look
.
<EOS>
She
seem
sorely
put
out
when
she
find
that
there
be
no
foundation
 
<EOS>
none
,
at
least
,
that
any
of
us
could
discover
 
for
the
report
of
her
daughter
have
be
see
in
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
rather
interested
about
Mrs.
Catherick
,
"
<EOS>
I
go
on
,
continue
the
conversation
as
long
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
have
arrive
here
soon
enough
to
see
her
yesterday
.
<EOS>
do
she
stay
for
any
length
of
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
housekeeper
,
"
she
stay
for
some
time
;
and
I
think
she
would
have
remain
longer
,
if
I
have
not
be
call
away
to
speak
to
a
strange
gentleman
 
a
gentleman
who
come
to
ask
when
Sir
Percival
be
expect
back
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
get
up
and
leave
at
once
,
when
she
hear
the
maid
tell
me
what
the
visitor
's
errand
be
.
<EOS>
She
say
to
me
,
at
parting
,
that
there
be
no
need
to
tell
Sir
Percival
of
her
come
here
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
rather
an
odd
remark
to
make
,
especially
to
a
person
in
my
responsible
situation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
an
odd
remark
too
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
certainly
lead
me
to
believe
,
at
Limmeridge
,
that
the
most
perfect
confidence
exist
between
himself
and
Mrs.
Catherick
.
<EOS>
if
that
be
the
case
,
why
should
she
be
anxious
to
have
<EOS>
her
visit
at
Blackwater
Park
keep
a
secret
from
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
probably
,
"
I
say
,
see
that
the
housekeeper
expect
me
to
give
my
opinion
on
Mrs.
Catherick
's
parting
word
<EOS>
,
"
probably
she
think
the
announcement
of
her
visit
may
vex
Sir
Percival
to
no
purpose
,
by
remind
him
that
her
lose
daughter
be
not
find
yet
.
<EOS>
do
she
talk
much
on
that
subject
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
little
,
"
reply
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
She
talk
principally
of
Sir
Percival
,
and
ask
a
great
many
question
about
where
he
have
be
travel
,
and
what
sort
of
lady
his
new
wife
be
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
be
more
sour
and
put
out
than
distressed
,
by
fail
to
find
any
trace
of
her
daughter
in
these
part
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
her
up
,
"
be
the
last
word
she
say
that
I
can
remember
;
"
I
give
her
up
,
madam
,
for
lose
.
"
<EOS>
and
from
that
she
pass
at
once
to
her
question
about
Lady
Glyde
,
want
to
know
if
she
be
a
handsome
,
amiable
lady
,
comely
and
healthy
and
young
 
<EOS>
ah
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
think
how
it
would
end
.
<EOS>
look
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
the
poor
thing
be
out
of
its
misery
at
last
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
dog
be
dead
.
<EOS>
It
have
give
a
faint
,
sob
cry
,
it
have
suffer
an
instant
's
convulsion
of
the
limb
,
just
as
those
last
word
,
"
comely
and
healthy
and
young
,
"
drop
from
the
housekeeper
's
lip
.
<EOS>
the
change
have
happen
with
startling
suddenness
 
in
one
moment
the
creature
lie
lifeless
under
our
hand
.
  
<EOS>
eight
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
return
from
dining
downstair
,
in
solitary
state
.
<EOS>
the
sunset
be
burn
redly
on
the
wilderness
of
tree
that
I
see
from
my
window
,
and
I
be
pore
over
my
journal
again
,
to
calm
my
impatience
for
the
return
of
the
traveller
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
have
arrive
,
by
my
calculation
,
before
this
.
<EOS>
how
still
and
lonely
the
house
be
in
the
drowsy
evening
quiet
!
<EOS>
oh
me
!
<EOS>
how
many
minute
more
before
I
hear
the
carriage
wheel
and
run
downstairs
to
find
myself
in
Laura
's
arm
?
  
<EOS>
the
poor
little
dog
!
<EOS>
I
wish
my
first
day
at
Blackwater
Park
have
not
be
associate
with
death
,
though
it
be
only
the
death
of
a
stray
animal
.
  
<EOS>
Welmingham
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
on
look
back
through
these
private
page
of
mine
,
that
Welmingham
be
the
name
of
the
place
where
Mrs.
Catherick
live
.
<EOS>
Her
note
be
still
in
my
possession
,
the
note
in
answer
to
that
letter
about
her
unhappy
daughter
which
Sir
Percival
oblige
me
to
write
.
<EOS>
one
of
these
day
,
when
I
can
find
a
safe
opportunity
,
I
will
take
the
note
with
me
by
way
of
introduction
,
and
try
what
I
can
make
of
Mrs.
Catherick
at
a
personal
interview
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
her
wishing
to
conceal
her
visit
to
this
place
from
Sir
Percival
's
knowledge
,
and
I
do
not
feel
half
so
sure
,
as
the
housekeeper
seem
to
do
,
that
her
daughter
Anne
be
not
in
the
neighbourhood
after
all
.
<EOS>
what
would
Walter
Hartright
have
say
in
this
emergency
?
<EOS>
poor
,
dear
Hartright
!
<EOS>
I
be
begin
to
feel
the
want
of
his
honest
advice
and
his
willing
help
already
.
  
<EOS>
surely
I
hear
something
.
<EOS>
be
it
a
bustle
of
footstep
below
stair
?
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
I
hear
the
horse
'
foot
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
rolling
wheel
      
June
15th
.
 
<EOS>
the
confusion
of
their
arrival
have
have
time
to
subside
.
<EOS>
two
day
have
elapse
since
the
return
of
the
traveller
,
and
that
interval
have
suffice
to
put
the
new
machinery
of
our
life
at
Blackwater
Park
in
fair
working
order
.
<EOS>
I
may
now
return
to
my
journal
,
with
some
little
chance
of
be
able
to
continue
the
entry
in
it
as
collectedly
as
usual
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
must
begin
by
put
down
an
odd
remark
which
have
suggest
itself
to
me
since
Laura
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
when
two
member
of
a
family
or
two
intimate
friend
be
separate
,
and
one
go
abroad
and
one
remain
at
home
,
the
return
of
the
relative
or
friend
who
have
be
travel
always
seem
to
place
the
relative
or
friend
who
have
be
stay
at
home
at
a
painful
disadvantage
when
the
two
first
meet
.
<EOS>
the
sudden
encounter
of
the
new
thought
and
new
habit
eagerly
gain
in
the
one
case
,
with
the
old
thought
and
old
habit
passively
preserve
in
the
other
,
seem
at
first
to
part
the
sympathy
of
the
most
loving
relative
and
the
fond
friend
,
and
to
set
a
sudden
strangeness
,
unexpected
by
both
and
uncontrollable
by
both
,
between
them
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
after
the
first
happiness
of
my
meeting
with
Laura
be
over
,
after
we
have
sit
down
together
hand
in
hand
to
recover
breath
enough
and
calmness
enough
to
talk
,
I
feel
this
strangeness
instantly
,
and
I
could
see
that
she
feel
it
too
.
<EOS>
It
have
partially
wear
away
,
now
that
we
have
fall
back
into
most
of
our
old
habit
,
and
it
will
probably
disappear
before
long
.
<EOS>
but
it
have
certainly
have
an
influence
over
the
first
impression
that
I
have
form
of
her
,
now
that
we
be
live
together
again
 
for
which
reason
only
I
have
think
fit
to
mention
it
here
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
find
me
unaltered
,
but
I
have
find
her
change
.
  
<EOS>
change
in
person
,
and
in
one
respect
change
in
character
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
absolutely
say
that
she
be
less
beautiful
than
she
use
to
be
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
she
be
less
beautiful
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
other
,
who
do
not
look
at
her
with
my
eye
and
my
recollection
,
would
probably
think
her
improved
.
<EOS>
there
be
more
colour
and
more
decision
and
roundness
of
outline
in
her
face
than
there
use
to
be
,
and
her
figure
seem
more
firmly
set
and
more
sure
and
easy
in
all
its
movement
than
it
be
in
her
maiden
day
.
<EOS>
but
I
miss
something
when
I
look
at
her
 
something
that
once
belong
to
the
happy
,
innocent
life
of
Laura
Fairlie
,
and
that
I
can
not
find
in
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
there
be
in
the
old
time
a
freshness
,
a
softness
,
an
ever
-
vary
and
yet
ever
-
remain
tenderness
of
beauty
in
her
face
,
the
charm
of
which
it
be
not
possible
to
express
in
word
,
or
,
as
poor
Hartright
use
often
to
say
,
in
painting
either
.
<EOS>
this
be
go
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
see
the
faint
reflection
of
it
for
a
moment
when
she
turn
pale
under
the
agitation
of
our
sudden
meeting
on
the
evening
of
her
return
,
but
it
have
never
reappear
since
.
<EOS>
none
of
her
letter
have
prepare
me
for
a
personal
change
in
her
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
they
have
lead
me
to
expect
that
her
marriage
have
leave
her
,
in
appearance
at
least
,
quite
unaltered
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
read
her
letter
wrongly
in
the
past
,
and
be
now
read
her
face
wrongly
in
the
present
?
<EOS>
no
matter
!
<EOS>
whether
her
beauty
have
gain
or
whether
it
have
lose
in
the
last
six
month
,
the
separation
either
way
have
make
her
own
dear
self
more
precious
to
me
than
ever
,
and
that
be
one
good
result
of
her
marriage
,
at
any
rate
!
  
<EOS>
the
second
change
,
the
change
that
I
have
observe
in
her
character
,
have
not
surprise
me
,
because
I
be
prepared
for
it
in
this
case
by
the
tone
of
her
letter
.
<EOS>
now
that
she
be
at
home
again
,
I
find
her
just
as
unwilling
to
enter
into
any
detail
on
the
subject
of
her
married
life
as
I
have
previously
find
her
all
through
the
time
of
our
separation
,
when
we
could
only
communicate
with
each
other
by
write
.
<EOS>
at
the
first
approach
I
make
to
the
forbid
topic
she
put
her
hand
on
my
lip
with
a
look
and
gesture
which
touchingly
,
almost
painfully
,
recall
to
my
memory
the
day
of
her
girlhood
and
the
happy
bygone
time
when
there
be
no
secret
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
whenever
you
and
I
be
together
,
<EOS>
Marian
<EOS>
,
"
she
say
,
"
we
shall
both
be
happy
and
easy
with
one
another
,
if
we
accept
my
married
life
for
what
it
be
,
and
say
and
think
as
little
about
it
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
would
tell
you
everything
,
darle
,
about
myself
,
"
she
go
on
,
nervously
buckle
and
unbuckle
the
ribbon
<EOS>
round
my
waist
,
"
if
my
confidence
could
only
end
there
.
<EOS>
but
they
could
not
 
they
would
lead
me
into
confidence
about
my
husband
too
;
and
now
I
be
married
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
have
better
avoid
them
,
for
his
sake
,
and
for
your
sake
,
and
for
mine
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
they
would
distress
you
,
or
distress
me
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
think
that
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
 
I
want
to
be
so
happy
,
now
I
have
get
you
back
again
,
and
I
want
you
to
be
so
happy
<EOS>
too
 
<EOS>
"
She
break
off
abruptly
,
and
look
round
<EOS>
the
room
,
my
own
sitting
-
room
,
in
which
we
be
talk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
"
she
cry
,
clap
her
hand
with
a
bright
smile
of
recognition
,
"
another
old
friend
find
already
!
<EOS>
Your

the
horrid
heavy
man

look

<EOS>
It
be
so
like
home
again
to
be
here
.
<EOS>
how
can
we
make
it
more
like
home
still
?
<EOS>
I
will
put
my
father
's
portrait
in
your
room
instead
of
in
mine
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
keep
all
my
little
treasure
from
Limmeridge
here
 
<EOS>
and
we
will
pass
hour
and
hour
every
day
with
these
four
friendly
wall
round
us
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Marian
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
suddenly
seat
herself
on
a
footstool
at
my
knee
,
and
look
up
earnestly
in
my
face
,
"
promise
you
will
never
marry
,
and
leave
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
selfish
to
say
so
,
but
you
be
so
much
well
off
as
a
single
woman
 
unless
 
unless
you
be
very
fond
of
your
husband
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
not
be
very
fond
of
anybody
but
me
,
will
you
?
"
<EOS>
She
stop
again
,
cross
my
hand
on
my
lap
,
and
lay
her
face
on
them
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
be
write
many
letter
,
and
receive
many
letter
lately
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
,
in
low
,
suddenly
-
alter
tone
.
<EOS>
I
understand
what
the
question
mean
,
but
I
think
it
my
duty
not
to
encourage
her
by
meet
her
half
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
hear
from
him
?
<EOS>
"
she
go
on
,
coax
me
to
forgive
the
more
direct
appeal
on
which
she
now
venture
,
by
kiss
my
hand
,
upon
which
her
face
still
rest
.
<EOS>
"
be
he
well
and
happy
,
and
get
on
in
his
profession
?
<EOS>
have
he
recover
himself
 
and
forget
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
should
not
have
ask
those
question
.
<EOS>
She
should
have
remember
her
own
resolution
,
on
the
morning
when
Sir
Percival
hold
her
to
her
marriage
engagement
,
and
when
she
resign
the
book
of
Hartright
's
drawing
into
my
hand
for
ever
.
<EOS>
but
,
ah
me
!
<EOS>
where
be
the
faultless
human
creature
who
can
persevere
in
a
good
resolution
,
without
sometimes
fail
and
fall
back
?
<EOS>
where
be
the
woman
who
have
ever
really
tear
from
her
heart
the
image
that
have
be
once
fix
in
it
by
a
true
love
?
<EOS>
book
tell
us
that
such
unearthly
creature
have
exist
 
but
what
do
our
own
experience
say
in
answer
to
book
?
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
attempt
to
remonstrate
with
her
:
perhaps
,
because
I
sincerely
appreciate
the
fearless
candour
which
let
me
see
,
what
other
woman
in
her
position
may
have
have
reason
for
conceal
even
from
their
dear
friend
 
perhaps
,
because
I
feel
,
in
my
own
heart
and
conscience
,
that
in
her
place
I
should
have
ask
the
same
question
and
have
the
same
thought
.
<EOS>
all
I
could
honestly
do
be
to
reply
that
I
have
not
write
to
him
or
hear
from
him
lately
,
and
then
to
turn
the
conversation
to
less
dangerous
topic
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
much
to
sadden
me
in
our
interview
 
my
first
confidential
interview
with
her
since
her
return
.
<EOS>
the
change
which
her
marriage
have
produce
in
our
relation
towards
each
other
,
by
place
a
forbid
subject
between
us
,
for
the
first
time
in
our
life
;
the
melancholy
conviction
of
the
dearth
of
all
warmth
of
feeling
,
of
all
close
sympathy
,
between
her
husband
and
herself
,
which
her
own
unwilling
word
now
force
on
my
mind
;
the
distress
discovery
that
the
influence
of
that
ill
-
fate
attachment
still
remain
(
no
matter
how
innocently
,
how
harmlessly
)
root
as
deeply
as
ever
in
her
heart
 
<EOS>
all
these
be
disclosure
to
sadden
any
woman
who
love
her
as
dearly
,
and
feel
for
her
as
acutely
,
as
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
consolation
to
set
against
them
 
a
consolation
that
ought
to
comfort
me
,
and
that
do
comfort
me
.
<EOS>
all
the
grace
and
gentleness
of
her
character
 
<EOS>
all
the
frank
affection
of
her
nature
 
<EOS>
all
the
sweet
,
simple
,
womanly
charm
which
use
to
make
her
the
darling
and
delight
of
every
one
who
approach
her
,
have
come
back
to
me
with
herself
.
<EOS>
of
my
other
impression
I
be
sometimes
a
little
inclined
to
doubt
.
<EOS>
of
this
last
,
best
,
happy
of
all
impression
,
I
grow
more
and
more
certain
every
hour
in
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
turn
,
now
,
from
her
to
her
travel
companion
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
must
engage
my
attention
first
.
<EOS>
what
have
I
observe
in
Sir
Percival
,
since
his
return
,
to
improve
my
opinion
of
him
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
say
.
<EOS>
small
vexation
and
annoyance
seem
to
have
beset
him
since
he
come
back
,
and
no
man
,
under
those
circumstance
,
be
ever
present
at
his
good
.
<EOS>
He
look
,
as
I
think
,
thin
than
he
be
when
he
leave
England
.
<EOS>
His
wearisome
cough
and
his
comfortless
restlessness
have
certainly
increase
.
<EOS>
His
manner
 
at
least
his
manner
towards
me
 
be
much
more
abrupt
than
it
use
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
greet
me
,
on
the
evening
of
his
return
,
with
little
or
nothing
of
the
ceremony
and
civility
of
former
time
 
<EOS>
no
polite
speech
of
welcome
 
<EOS>
no
appearance
of
extraordinary
gratification
at
see
me
 
nothing
but
a
short
shake
of
the
hand
,
and
a
sharp
"
how
-
d'ye
-
do
,
Miss
Halcombe
 
<EOS>
glad
to
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
seem
to
accept
me
as
one
of
the
necessary
fixture
of
Blackwater
Park
,
to
be
satisfied
at
find
me
establish
in
my
proper
place
,
and
then
to
pass
me
over
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
Most
man
show
something
of
their
disposition
in
their
own
house
,
which
they
have
conceal
elsewhere
,
and
Sir
Percival
have
already
display
a
mania
for
order
and
regularity
,
which
be
quite
a
new
revelation
of
him
,
so
far
as
my
previous
knowledge
of
his
character
be
concern
.
<EOS>
if
I
take
a
book
from
the
library
and
leave
it
on
the
table
,
he
follow
me
and
put
it
back
again
.
<EOS>
if
I
rise
from
a
chair
,
and
let
it
remain
where
I
have
be
sit
,
he
carefully
restore
it
to
its
proper
place
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
He
pick
up
stray
flower
-
blossom
from
the
carpet
,
and
mutter
to
himself
as
discontentedly
as
if
they
be
hot
cinder
burn
hole
in
it
,
and
he
storm
at
the
servant
if
there
be
a
crease
in
the
tablecloth
,
or
a
knife
miss
from
its
place
at
the
dinner
-
table
,
as
fiercely
as
if
they
have
personally
insult
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
already
refer
to
the
small
annoyance
which
appear
to
have
trouble
him
since
his
return
.
<EOS>
much
of
the
alteration
for
the
bad
which
I
have
notice
in
him
may
be
due
to
these
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
persuade
myself
that
it
be
so
,
because
I
be
anxious
not
to
be
dishearten
already
about
the
future
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
try
to
any
man
's
temper
to
be
meet
by
a
vexation
the
moment
he
set
foot
in
his
own
house
again
,
after
a
long
absence
,
and
this
annoying
circumstance
do
really
happen
to
Sir
Percival
in
my
presence
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
evening
of
their
arrival
the
housekeeper
follow
me
into
the
hall
to
receive
her
master
and
mistress
and
their
guest
.
<EOS>
the
instant
he
see
her
,
Sir
Percival
ask
if
any
one
have
call
lately
.
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
mention
to
him
,
in
reply
,
what
she
have
previously
mention
to
me
,
the
visit
of
the
strange
gentleman
to
make
inquiry
about
the
time
of
her
master
's
return
.
<EOS>
He
ask
immediately
for
the
gentleman
's
name
.
<EOS>
no
name
have
be
leave
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
's
business
?
<EOS>
no
business
have
be
mention
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
gentleman
like
?
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
try
to
describe
him
,
but
fail
to
distinguish
the
nameless
visitor
by
any
personal
peculiarity
which
her
master
could
recognise
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
frown
,
stamp
angrily
on
the
floor
,
and
walk
on
into
the
house
,
take
no
notice
of
anybody
.
<EOS>
why
he
should
have
be
so
discompose
by
a
trifle
I
can
not
say
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
seriously
discompose
,
beyond
all
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
it
will
be
good
,
perhaps
,
if
I
abstain
from
form
a
decisive
opinion
of
his
manner
,
language
,
and
conduct
in
his
own
house
,
until
time
have
enable
him
to
shake
off
the
anxiety
,
whatever
they
may
be
,
which
now
evidently
trouble
his
mind
in
secret
.
<EOS>
I
will
turn
over
to
a
new
page
,
and
my
pen
shall
let
Laura
's
husband
alone
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
guest
 
the
Count
and
Countess
Fosco
 
come
next
in
my
catalogue
.
<EOS>
I
will
dispose
of
the
countess
first
,
so
as
to
have
do
with
the
woman
as
soon
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Laura
be
certainly
not
chargeable
with
any
exaggeration
,
in
write
me
word
that
I
should
hardly
recognise
her
aunt
again
when
we
meet
.
<EOS>
never
before
have
I
beheld
such
a
change
produce
in
a
woman
by
her
marriage
as
have
be
produce
in
Madame
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
as
Eleanor
Fairlie
(
aged
seven
-
and
-
thirty
)
,
she
be
always
talk
pretentious
nonsense
,
and
always
worry
the
unfortunate
man
with
every
small
exaction
which
a
vain
and
foolish
woman
can
impose
on
long
-
suffer
male
humanity
.
<EOS>
as
Madame
Fosco
(
age
three
-
and
-
forty
)
,
she
sit
for
hour
together
without
say
a
word
,
freeze
up
in
the
strange
manner
in
herself
.
<EOS>
the
hideously
ridiculous
love
-
lock
which
use
to
hang
on
either
side
of
her
face
be
now
replace
by
stiff
little
row
of
very
short
curl
,
of
the
sort
one
see
in
old
-
fashioned
wig
.
<EOS>
a
plain
,
matronly
cap
cover
her
head
,
and
make
her
look
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
since
I
remember
her
,
like
a
decent
woman
.
<EOS>
nobody
(
put
her
husband
out
of
the
question
,
of
course
)
now
see
in
her
,
what
everybody
once
see
 
<EOS>
I
mean
the
structure
of
the
female
skeleton
,
in
the
upper
region
of
the
collar
-
bone
and
the
shoulder
-
blade
.
<EOS>
clothe
in
quiet
black
or
grey
gown
,
make
high
round
the
throat
 
<EOS>
dress
that
she
would
have
laugh
at
,
or
scream
at
,
as
the
whim
of
the
moment
incline
her
,
in
her
maiden
day
 
<EOS>
she
sit
speechless
in
corner
;
her
dry
white
hand
(
so
dry
that
the
pore
of
her
skin
look
chalky
)
incessantly
engage
,
either
in
monotonous
embroidery
work
or
in
roll
up
endless
cigarette
for
the
Count
's
own
particular
smoking
.
<EOS>
on
the
few
occasion
when
her
cold
blue
eye
be
off
her
work
,
they
be
generally
turn
on
her
husband
,
with
the
look
of
mute
submissive
inquiry
which
we
be
all
familiar
with
in
the
eye
of
a
faithful
dog
.
<EOS>
the
only
approach
to
an
inward
thaw
which
I
have
yet
detect
under
her
outer
covering
of
icy
constraint
,
have
betray
itself
,
once
or
twice
,
in
the
form
of
a
suppress
tigerish
jealousy
of
any
woman
in
the
house
(
the
maid
include
)
to
whom
the
Count
speak
,
or
on
whom
he
look
with
anything
approach
to
special
interest
or
attention
.
<EOS>
except
in
this
one
particular
,
she
be
always
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
indoor
and
out
,
fair
weather
or
foul
,
as
cold
as
a
statue
,
and
as
impenetrable
as
the
stone
out
of
which
it
be
cut
.
<EOS>
for
the
common
purpose
of
society
the
extraordinary
change
thus
produce
in
her
be
,
beyond
all
doubt
,
a
change
for
the
well
,
see
that
it
have
transform
her
into
a
civil
,
silent
,
unobtrusive
woman
,
who
be
never
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
how
far
she
be
really
reform
or
deteriorate
in
her
secret
self
,
be
another
question
.
<EOS>
I
have
once
or
twice
see
sudden
change
of
expression
on
her
pinch
lip
,
and
hear
sudden
inflexion
of
tone
in
her
calm
voice
,
which
have
lead
me
to
suspect
that
her
present
state
of
suppression
may
have
seal
up
something
dangerous
in
her
nature
,
which
use
to
evaporate
harmlessly
in
the
freedom
of
her
former
life
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
possible
that
I
may
be
altogether
wrong
in
this
idea
.
<EOS>
My
own
impression
,
however
,
be
,
that
I
be
right
.
<EOS>
Time
will
show
.
  
<EOS>
and
the
magician
who
have
work
this
wonderful
transformation
 
the
foreign
husband
who
have
tame
this
once
wayward
english
woman
till
her
own
relation
hardly
know
her
again
 
the
Count
himself
?
<EOS>
what
of
the
Count
?
  
<EOS>
this
in
two
word
<EOS>
:
He
look
like
a
man
who
could
tame
anything
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
marry
a
tigress
,
instead
of
a
woman
,
he
would
have
tame
the
tigress
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
marry
me
,
I
should
have
make
his
cigarette
,
as
his
wife
do
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
hold
my
tongue
when
he
look
at
me
,
as
she
hold
hers
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
almost
afraid
to
confess
it
,
even
to
these
secret
page
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
interest
me
,
have
attract
me
,
have
force
me
to
like
him
.
<EOS>
in
two
short
day
he
have
make
his
way
straight
into
my
favourable
estimation
,
and
how
he
have
work
the
miracle
be
more
than
I
can
tell
.
  
<EOS>
It
absolutely
startle
me
,
now
he
be
in
my
mind
,
to
find
how
plainly
I
see
him
!
 
<EOS>
how
much
more
plainly
than
I
see
Sir
Percival
,
or
Mr.
Fairlie
,
or
Walter
Hartright
,
or
any
other
absent
person
of
whom
I
think
,
with
the
one
exception
of
Laura
herself
!
<EOS>
I
can
hear
his
voice
,
as
if
he
be
speak
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
his
conversation
be
yesterday
,
as
well
as
if
I
be
hear
it
now
.
<EOS>
how
be
I
to
describe
him
?
<EOS>
there
be
peculiarity
in
his
personal
appearance
,
his
habit
,
and
his
amusement
,
which
I
should
blame
in
the
bold
term
,
or
ridicule
in
the
most
merciless
manner
,
if
I
have
see
them
in
another
man
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
that
make
me
unable
to
blame
them
,
or
to
ridicule
them
in
him
?
  
<EOS>
for
example
,
he
be
immensely
fat
.
<EOS>
before
this
time
I
have
always
especially
dislike
corpulent
humanity
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
maintain
that
the
popular
notion
of
connect
excessive
grossness
of
size
and
excessive
good
-
humour
as
inseparable
ally
be
equivalent
to
declare
,
either
that
no
people
but
amiable
people
ever
get
fat
,
or
that
the
accidental
addition
of
so
many
pound
of
flesh
have
a
directly
favourable
influence
over
the
disposition
of
the
person
on
whose
body
they
accumulate
.
<EOS>
I
have
invariably
combat
both
these
absurd
assertion
by
quote
example
of
fat
people
who
be
as
mean
,
vicious
,
and
cruel
as
the
lean
and
the
bad
of
their
neighbour
.
<EOS>
I
have
ask
whether
Henry
the
Eighth
be
an
amiable
character
?
<EOS>
whether
Pope
Alexander
the
Sixth
be
a
good
man
?
<EOS>
whether
Mr.
Murderer
and
Mrs.
Murderess
Manning
be
not
both
unusually
stout
people
?
<EOS>
whether
hire
nurse
,
proverbially
as
cruel
a
set
of
woman
as
be
to
be
find
in
all
England
,
be
not
,
for
the
most
part
,
also
as
fat
a
set
of
woman
as
be
to
be
find
in
all
England
?
 
<EOS>
and
so
on
,
through
dozen
of
other
example
,
modern
and
ancient
,
native
and
foreign
,
high
and
low
.
<EOS>
hold
these
strong
opinion
on
the
subject
with
might
and
main
as
I
do
at
this
moment
,
here
,
nevertheless
,
be
Count
Fosco
,
as
fat
as
Henry
the
Eighth
himself
,
establish
in
my
favour
,
at
one
day
's
notice
,
without
let
or
hindrance
from
his
own
odious
corpulence
.
<EOS>
marvellous
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
be
it
his
face
that
have
recommend
him
?
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
most
remarkable
likeness
,
on
a
large
scale
,
of
the
great
Napoleon
.
<EOS>
His
feature
have
Napoleon
's
magnificent
regularity
 
his
expression
recall
the
grandly
calm
,
immovable
power
of
the
Great
Soldier
's
face
.
<EOS>
this
strike
resemblance
certainly
impress
me
,
to
begin
with
;
but
there
be
something
in
him
besides
the
resemblance
,
which
have
impress
me
more
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
influence
I
be
now
try
to
find
be
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
most
unfathomable
grey
eye
I
ever
see
,
and
they
have
at
time
a
cold
,
clear
,
beautiful
,
irresistible
glitter
in
them
which
force
me
to
look
at
him
,
and
yet
cause
me
sensation
,
when
I
do
look
,
which
I
would
rather
not
feel
.
<EOS>
other
part
of
his
face
and
head
have
their
strange
peculiarity
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
,
for
instance
,
have
a
singular
sallow
-
fairness
,
so
much
at
variance
with
the
dark
-
brown
colour
of
his
hair
,
that
I
suspect
the
hair
of
be
a
wig
,
and
his
face
,
closely
shave
all
over
,
be
smooth
and
free
from
all
mark
and
wrinkle
than
mine
,
though
(
accord
to
Sir
Percival
's
account
of
him
)
he
be
close
on
sixty
year
of
age
.
<EOS>
but
these
be
not
the
prominent
personal
characteristic
which
distinguish
him
,
to
my
mind
,
from
all
the
other
man
I
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
the
marked
peculiarity
which
single
him
out
from
the
rank
and
file
of
humanity
lie
entirely
,
so
far
as
I
can
tell
at
present
,
in
the
extraordinary
expression
and
extraordinary
power
of
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
His
manner
and
his
command
of
our
language
may
also
have
assist
him
,
in
some
degree
,
to
establish
himself
in
my
good
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
have
that
quiet
deference
,
that
look
of
pleased
,
attentive
interest
in
listen
to
a
woman
,
and
that
secret
gentleness
in
his
voice
in
speak
to
a
woman
,
which
,
say
what
we
may
,
we
can
none
of
us
resist
.
<EOS>
here
,
too
,
his
unusual
command
of
the
english
language
necessarily
help
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
hear
of
the
extraordinary
aptitude
which
many
Italians
show
in
master
our
strong
,
hard
,
northern
speech
;
but
,
until
I
see
Count
Fosco
,
I
have
never
suppose
it
possible
that
any
foreigner
could
have
speak
English
as
he
speak
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
time
when
it
be
almost
impossible
to
detect
,
by
his
accent
that
he
be
not
a
countryman
of
our
own
,
and
as
for
fluency
,
there
be
very
few
bear
englishman
who
can
talk
with
as
few
stoppage
and
repetition
as
the
Count
.
<EOS>
He
may
construct
his
sentence
more
or
less
in
the
foreign
way
,
but
I
have
never
yet
hear
him
use
a
wrong
expression
,
or
hesitate
for
a
moment
in
his
choice
of
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
small
characteristic
of
this
strange
man
have
something
strikingly
original
and
perplexingly
contradictory
in
them
.
<EOS>
fat
as
he
be
and
old
as
he
be
,
his
movement
be
astonishingly
light
and
easy
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
noiseless
in
a
room
as
any
of
us
woman
,
and
more
than
that
,
with
all
his
look
of
unmistakable
mental
firmness
and
power
,
he
be
as
nervously
sensitive
as
the
weak
of
us
.
<EOS>
He
start
at
chance
noise
as
inveterately
as
Laura
herself
.
<EOS>
He
wince
and
shudder
yesterday
,
when
Sir
Percival
beat
one
of
the
spaniel
,
so
that
I
feel
ashamed
of
my
own
want
of
tenderness
and
sensibility
by
comparison
with
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
the
relation
of
this
last
incident
remind
me
of
one
of
his
most
curious
peculiarity
,
which
I
have
not
yet
mention
 
his
extraordinary
fondness
for
pet
animal
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
these
he
have
leave
on
the
continent
,
but
he
have
bring
with
him
to
this
house
a
cockatoo
,
two
canary
-
bird
,
and
a
whole
family
of
white
mouse
.
<EOS>
He
attend
to
all
the
necessity
of
these
strange
favourite
himself
,
and
he
have
teach
the
creature
to
be
surprisingly
fond
of
him
and
familiar
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
cockatoo
,
a
most
vicious
and
treacherous
bird
towards
every
one
else
,
absolutely
seem
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
let
it
out
of
its
cage
,
it
hop
on
to
his
knee
,
and
claw
its
way
up
his
great
big
body
,
and
rub
its
top
-
knot
against
his
sallow
double
chin
in
the
most
caressing
manner
imaginable
.
<EOS>
He
have
only
to
set
the
door
of
the
canary
'
cage
open
,
and
to
call
them
,
and
the
pretty
little
cleverly
train
creature
perch
fearlessly
on
his
hand
,
mount
his
fat
outstretche
finger
one
by
one
,
when
he
tell
them
to
"
go
upstairs
,
"
and
sing
together
as
if
they
would
burst
their
throat
with
delight
when
they
get
to
the
top
finger
.
<EOS>
His
white
mouse
live
in
a
little
pagoda
of
gaily
-
paint
wirework
,
design
and
make
by
himself
.
<EOS>
They
be
almost
as
tame
as
the
canary
,
and
they
be
perpetually
let
out
like
the
canary
.
<EOS>
They
crawl
all
over
him
,
pop
in
and
out
of
his
waistcoat
,
and
sit
in
couple
,
white
as
snow
,
on
his
capacious
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
even
fonder
of
his
mouse
than
of
his
other
pet
,
smile
at
them
,
and
kiss
them
,
and
call
them
by
all
sort
of
endear
name
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
possible
to
suppose
an
Englishman
with
any
taste
for
such
childish
interest
and
amusement
as
these
,
that
Englishman
would
certainly
feel
rather
ashamed
of
them
,
and
would
be
anxious
to
apologise
for
them
,
in
the
company
of
grow
-
up
people
.
<EOS>
but
the
Count
,
apparently
,
see
nothing
ridiculous
in
the
amazing
contrast
between
his
colossal
self
and
his
frail
little
pet
.
<EOS>
He
would
blandly
kiss
his
white
mouse
and
twitt
to
his
canary
-
bird
amid
an
assembly
of
English
fox
-
hunter
,
and
would
only
pity
them
as
barbarian
when
they
be
all
laugh
their
loud
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
hardly
credible
while
I
be
write
it
down
,
but
it
be
certainly
true
,
that
this
same
man
,
who
have
all
the
fondness
of
an
old
maid
for
his
cockatoo
,
and
all
the
small
dexterity
of
an
organ
-
boy
in
manage
his
white
mouse
,
can
talk
,
when
anything
happen
to
rouse
him
,
with
a
daring
independence
of
thought
,
a
knowledge
of
book
in
every
language
,
and
an
experience
of
society
in
half
the
capital
of
Europe
,
which
would
make
him
the
prominent
personage
of
any
assembly
in
the
civilised
world
.
<EOS>
this
trainer
of
canary
-
bird
,
this
architect
of
a
pagoda
for
white
mouse
,
be
(
as
Sir
Percival
himself
have
tell
me
)
one
of
the
first
experimental
chemist
live
,
and
have
discover
,
among
other
wonderful
invention
,
a
means
of
petrify
the
body
after
death
,
so
as
to
preserve
it
,
as
hard
as
marble
,
to
the
end
of
time
.
<EOS>
this
fat
,
indolent
,
elderly
man
,
whose
nerve
be
so
finely
string
that
he
start
at
chance
noise
,
and
wince
when
he
see
a
house
-
spaniel
get
a
whipping
,
go
into
the
stable
-
yard
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
,
and
put
his
hand
on
the
head
of
a
chain
bloodhound
 
a
beast
<EOS>
so
savage
that
the
very
groom
who
feed
him
keep
out
of
his
reach
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
I
be
present
,
and
I
shall
not
forget
the
scene
that
follow
,
short
as
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
mind
that
dog
,
sir
,
"
say
the
groom
;
"
he
fly
at
everybody
!
"
<EOS>
"
He
do
that
,
my
friend
,
"
reply
the
Count
quietly
,
"
because
everybody
be
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
let
us
see
if
he
fly
at
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
lay
his
plump
,
yellow
-
white
finger
,
on
which
the
canary
-
bird
have
be
perch
ten
minute
before
,
upon
the
formidable
brute
's
head
,
and
look
him
straight
in
the
eye
.
<EOS>
"
You
big
dog
be
all
coward
,
"
he
say
,
address
the
animal
contemptuously
,
with
his
face
and
the
dog
be
within
an
inch
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
kill
a
poor
cat
,
you
infernal
coward
.
<EOS>
You
would
fly
at
a
starve
beggar
,
you
infernal
coward
.
<EOS>
anything
that
you
can
surprise
unaware
 
anything
that
be
afraid
of
your
big
body
,
and
your
wicked
white
tooth
,
and
your
slobbering
,
bloodthirsty
mouth
,
be
the
thing
you
like
to
fly
at
.
<EOS>
You
could
throttle
me
at
this
moment
,
you
mean
,
miserable
bully
,
and
you
dare
not
so
much
as
look
me
in
the
face
,
because
I
be
not
afraid
of
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
think
better
of
it
,
and
try
your
tooth
in
my
fat
neck
?
<EOS>
bah
!
<EOS>
not
you
!
"
<EOS>
He
turn
away
,
laugh
at
the
astonishment
of
the
man
in
the
yard
,
and
the
dog
creep
back
meekly
to
his
kennel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
my
nice
waistcoat
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
pathetically
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
I
come
here
.
<EOS>
some
of
that
brute
's
slobber
have
get
on
my
pretty
clean
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
"
those
word
express
another
of
his
incomprehensible
oddity
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
fond
of
fine
clothe
as
the
veri
fool
in
existence
,
and
have
appear
in
four
magnificent
waistcoat
already
 
all
of
light
garish
colour
,
and
all
immensely
large
even
for
him
 
in
the
two
day
of
his
residence
at
Blackwater
Park
.
  
<EOS>
His
tact
and
cleverness
in
small
thing
be
quite
as
noticeable
as
the
singular
inconsistency
in
his
character
,
and
the
childish
triviality
of
his
ordinary
taste
and
pursuit
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
see
already
that
he
mean
to
live
on
excellent
term
with
all
of
us
during
the
period
of
his
sojourn
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
He
have
evidently
discover
that
Laura
secretly
dislike
him
(
she
confess
as
much
to
me
when
I
press
her
on
the
subject
)
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
also
find
out
that
she
be
extravagantly
fond
of
flower
.
<EOS>
whenever
she
want
a
nosegay
he
have
get
one
to
give
her
,
gather
and
arrange
by
himself
,
and
greatly
to
my
amusement
,
he
be
always
cunningly
provide
with
a
duplicate
,
compose
of
exactly
the
same
flower
,
group
in
exactly
the
same
way
,
to
appease
his
icily
jealous
wife
before
she
can
so
much
as
think
herself
aggrieved
.
<EOS>
His
management
of
the
Countess
(
in
public
)
be
a
sight
to
see
.
<EOS>
He
bow
to
her
,
he
habitually
address
her
as
"
my
angel
,
"
he
carry
his
canary
to
pay
her
little
visit
on
his
finger
and
to
sing
to
her
,
he
kiss
her
hand
when
she
give
him
his
cigarette
;
he
present
her
with
sugar
-
plum
in
return
,
which
he
put
into
her
mouth
playfully
,
from
a
box
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
the
rod
of
iron
with
which
he
rule
her
never
appear
in
company
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
private
rod
,
and
be
always
keep
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
His
method
of
recommend
himself
to
me
be
entirely
different
.
<EOS>
He
flatter
my
vanity
by
talk
to
me
as
seriously
and
sensibly
as
if
I
be
a
man
.
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
I
can
find
him
out
when
I
be
away
from
him
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
flatter
my
vanity
,
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
him
up
here
in
my
own
room
 
and
yet
,
when
I
go
downstairs
,
and
get
into
his
company
again
,
he
will
blind
me
again
,
and
I
shall
be
flatter
again
,
just
as
if
I
have
never
find
him
out
at
all
!
<EOS>
He
can
manage
me
as
he
manage
his
wife
and
Laura
,
as
he
manage
the
bloodhound
in
the
stable
-
yard
,
as
he
manage
Sir
Percival
himself
,
every
hour
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
Percival
!
<EOS>
how
I
like
your
rough
english
humour
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
Percival
!
<EOS>
how
I
enjoy
your
solid
english
sense
!
"
<EOS>
He
put
the
rude
remark
Sir
Percival
can
make
on
his
effeminate
taste
and
amusement
quietly
away
from
him
in
that
manner
 
always
call
the
baronet
by
his
christian
name
,
smile
at
him
with
the
calm
superiority
,
pat
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
bear
with
him
benignantly
,
as
a
good
-
humoured
father
bear
with
a
wayward
son
.
  
<EOS>
the
interest
which
I
really
can
not
help
feel
in
this
strangely
original
man
have
lead
me
to
question
Sir
Percival
about
his
past
life
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
either
know
little
,
or
will
tell
me
little
,
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
and
the
Count
first
meet
many
year
ago
,
at
Rome
,
under
the
dangerous
circumstance
to
which
I
have
allude
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
since
that
time
they
have
be
perpetually
together
in
London
,
in
Paris
,
and
in
Vienna
 
but
never
in
Italy
again
;
the
Count
have
,
oddly
enough
,
not
cross
the
frontier
of
his
native
country
for
year
past
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
be
make
the
victim
of
some
political
persecution
?
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
he
seem
to
be
patriotically
anxious
not
to
lose
sight
of
any
of
his
own
countryman
who
may
happen
to
be
in
England
.
<EOS>
on
the
evening
of
his
arrival
he
ask
how
far
we
be
from
the
near
town
,
and
whether
we
know
of
any
italian
gentleman
who
may
happen
to
be
settle
there
.
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
in
correspondence
with
people
on
the
Continent
,
for
his
letter
have
all
sort
of
odd
stamp
on
them
,
and
I
see
one
for
him
this
morning
,
wait
in
his
place
at
the
breakfast
-
table
,
with
a
huge
,
official
-
look
seal
on
it
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
be
in
correspondence
with
his
government
?
<EOS>
and
yet
,
that
be
hardly
to
be
reconcile
either
with
my
other
idea
that
he
may
be
a
political
exile
.
  
<EOS>
how
much
I
seem
to
have
write
about
Count
Fosco
!
<EOS>
and
what
do
it
all
amount
to
?
 
<EOS>
as
poor
,
dear
Mr.
Gilmore
would
ask
,
in
his
impenetrable
business
-
like
way
I
can
only
repeat
that
I
do
assuredly
feel
,
even
on
this
short
acquaintance
,
a
strange
,
half
-
willing
,
half
-
unwilling
liking
for
the
Count
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
establish
over
me
the
same
sort
of
ascendency
which
he
have
evidently
gain
over
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
free
,
and
even
rude
,
as
he
may
occasionally
be
in
his
manner
towards
his
fat
friend
,
Sir
Percival
be
nevertheless
afraid
,
as
I
can
plainly
see
,
of
give
any
serious
offence
to
the
Count
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
I
be
afraid
too
?
<EOS>
I
certainly
never
see
a
man
,
in
all
my
experience
,
whom
I
should
be
so
sorry
to
have
for
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
be
this
because
I
like
him
,
or
because
I
be
afraid
of
him
?
<EOS>
Chi
sa
?
 
<EOS>
as
Count
Fosco
may
say
in
his
own
language
.
<EOS>
who
know
?
  
<EOS>
June
16th
.
 
<EOS>
something
to
chronicle
to
-
day
besides
my
own
idea
and
impression
.
<EOS>
a
visitor
have
arrive
 
quite
unknown
to
Laura
and
to
me
,
and
apparently
quite
unexpected
by
Sir
Percival
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
all
at
lunch
,
in
the
room
with
the
new
french
window
that
open
into
the
verandah
,
and
the
Count
(
who
devour
pastry
as
I
have
never
yet
see
it
devour
by
any
human
being
but
girl
at
boarding
-
school
)
have
just
amuse
us
by
ask
gravely
for
his
fourth
tart
 
when
the
servant
enter
to
announce
the
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Merriman
have
just
come
,
Sir
Percival
,
and
wish
to
see
you
immediately
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
start
,
and
look
at
the
man
with
an
expression
of
angry
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Merriman
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeat
,
as
if
he
think
his
own
ear
must
have
deceive
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Sir
Percival
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Merriman
,
from
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
library
,
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
leave
the
table
the
instant
the
last
answer
be
give
,
and
hurry
out
of
the
room
without
say
a
word
to
any
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
Mr.
Merriman
?
<EOS>
"
ask
Laura
,
appeal
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
idea
,
"
be
all
I
could
say
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
the
Count
have
finish
his
fourth
tart
,
and
have
go
to
a
side
-
table
to
look
after
his
vicious
cockatoo
.
<EOS>
He
turn
round
to
us
with
the
bird
perch
on
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Merriman
be
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
,
"
he
say
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
perfectly
straightforward
answer
to
Laura
's
question
,
and
yet
,
under
the
circumstance
,
it
be
not
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Merriman
have
be
specially
send
for
by
his
client
,
there
would
have
be
nothing
very
wonderful
in
his
leave
town
to
obey
the
summon
.
<EOS>
but
when
a
lawyer
travel
from
London
to
Hampshire
without
be
send
for
,
and
when
his
arrival
at
a
gentleman
's
house
seriously
startle
the
gentleman
himself
,
it
may
be
safely
take
for
grant
that
the
legal
visitor
be
the
bearer
of
some
very
important
and
very
unexpected
news
 
news
which
may
be
either
very
good
or
very
bad
,
but
which
can
not
,
in
either
case
,
be
of
the
common
everyday
kind
.
  
<EOS>
Laura
and
I
sit
silent
at
the
table
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
,
wonder
uneasily
what
have
happen
,
and
wait
for
the
chance
of
Sir
Percival
's
speedy
return
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sign
of
his
return
,
and
we
rise
to
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
Count
,
attentive
as
usual
,
advanced
from
the
corner
in
which
he
have
be
feed
his
cockatoo
,
with
the
bird
still
perch
on
his
shoulder
,
and
open
the
door
for
us
.
<EOS>
Laura
and
Madame
Fosco
go
out
first
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
be
on
the
point
of
follow
them
he
make
a
sign
with
his
hand
,
and
speak
to
me
,
before
I
pass
him
,
in
the
oddest
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
say
,
quietly
answer
the
unexpressed
idea
at
that
moment
in
my
mind
,
as
if
I
have
plainly
confide
it
to
him
in
so
many
word
 
"
yes
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
something
have
happen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
on
the
point
of
answering
,
"
<EOS>
I
never
say
so
,
"
but
the
vicious
cockatoo
ruffle
his
clipped
wing
and
give
a
screech
that
set
all
my
nerve
on
edge
in
an
instant
,
and
make
me
only
too
glad
to
get
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
join
Laura
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
.
<EOS>
the
thought
in
her
mind
be
the
same
as
the
thought
in
mine
,
which
Count
Fosco
have
surprise
,
and
when
she
speak
her
word
be
almost
the
echo
of
his
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
say
to
me
secretly
that
she
be
afraid
something
have
happen
.
    
<EOS>
June
16th
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
few
line
more
to
add
to
this
day
's
entry
before
I
go
to
bed
to
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
about
two
hour
after
Sir
Percival
rise
from
the
luncheon
-
table
to
receive
his
solicitor
,
Mr.
Merriman
,
in
the
library
,
I
leave
my
room
alone
to
take
a
walk
in
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
be
at
the
end
of
the
landing
the
library
door
open
and
the
two
gentleman
come
out
.
<EOS>
think
it
good
not
to
disturb
them
by
appear
on
the
stair
,
I
resolve
to
defer
go
down
till
they
have
cross
the
hall
.
<EOS>
although
they
speak
to
each
other
in
guard
tone
,
their
word
be
pronounce
with
sufficient
distinctness
of
utterance
to
reach
my
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
make
your
mind
easy
,
Sir
Percival
,
"
I
hear
the
lawyer
say
;
"
it
all
rest
with
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
turn
to
go
back
to
my
own
room
for
a
minute
or
two
,
but
the
sound
of
Laura
's
name
on
the
lip
of
a
stranger
stop
me
instantly
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
it
be
very
wrong
and
very
discreditable
to
listen
,
but
where
be
the
woman
,
in
the
whole
range
of
our
sex
,
who
can
regulate
her
action
by
the
abstract
principle
of
honour
,
when
those
principle
point
one
way
,
and
when
her
affection
,
and
the
interest
which
grow
out
of
them
,
point
the
other
?
  
<EOS>
I
listen
 
and
under
similar
circumstance
I
would
listen
again
 
yes
!
<EOS>
with
my
ear
at
the
keyhole
,
if
I
could
not
possibly
manage
it
in
any
other
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
quite
understand
,
Sir
Percival
,
"
the
lawyer
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
be
to
sign
her
name
in
the
presence
of
a
witness
 
or
of
two
witness
,
if
you
wish
to
be
particularly
careful
 
and
be
then
to
put
her
finger
on
the
seal
and
say
,
"
I
deliver
this
as
my
act
and
deed
.
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
do
in
a
week
's
time
the
arrangement
will
be
perfectly
successful
,
and
the
anxiety
will
be
all
over
.
<EOS>
if
not
 
"
  
"
what
do
you
mean
by
"
if
not
'
?
"
ask
Sir
Percival
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
if
the
thing
must
be
do
it
SHALL
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
promise
you
that
,
Merriman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
just
so
,
Sir
Percival
 
<EOS>
just
so
;
but
there
be
two
alternative
in
all
transaction
,
and
we
lawyer
like
to
look
both
of
them
in
the
face
boldly
.
<EOS>
if
through
any
extraordinary
circumstance
the
arrangement
should
not
be
make
,
I
think
I
may
be
able
to
get
the
party
to
accept
bill
at
three
month
.
<EOS>
but
how
the
money
be
to
be
raise
when
the
bill
fall
due
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
damn
the
bill
!
<EOS>
the
money
be
only
to
be
get
in
one
way
,
and
in
that
way
,
I
tell
you
again
,
it
SHALL
be
get
.
<EOS>
take
a
glass
of
wine
,
Merriman
,
before
you
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
much
oblige
,
Sir
Percival
,
I
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
if
I
be
to
catch
the
up
-
train
.
<EOS>
You
will
let
me
know
as
soon
as
the
arrangement
be
complete
?
<EOS>
and
you
will
not
forget
the
caution
I
recommend
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
dog
-
cart
at
the
door
for
you
.
<EOS>
My
groom
will
get
you
to
the
station
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
Benjamin
,
drive
like
mad
!
<EOS>
jump
in
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Merriman
miss
the
train
you
lose
your
place
.
<EOS>
hold
fast
,
Merriman
,
and
if
you
be
upset
trust
to
the
devil
to
save
his
own
.
"
<EOS>
with
that
parting
benediction
the
baronet
turn
about
and
walk
back
to
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
hear
much
,
but
the
little
that
have
reach
my
ear
be
enough
to
make
me
feel
uneasy
.
<EOS>
the
"
something
"
that
"
have
happen
"
be
but
too
plainly
a
serious
money
embarrassment
,
and
Sir
Percival
's
relief
from
it
depend
upon
Laura
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
see
her
involve
in
her
husband
's
secret
difficulty
fill
me
with
dismay
,
exaggerate
,
no
doubt
,
by
my
ignorance
of
business
and
my
settled
distrust
of
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
instead
of
go
out
,
as
I
propose
,
I
go
back
immediately
to
Laura
's
room
to
tell
her
what
I
have
hear
.
  
<EOS>
She
receive
my
bad
news
so
composedly
as
to
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
She
evidently
know
more
of
her
husband
's
character
and
her
husband
's
embarrassment
than
I
have
suspect
up
to
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
as
much
,
"
she
say
,
"
when
I
hear
of
that
strange
gentleman
who
call
,
and
decline
to
leave
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
do
you
think
the
gentleman
be
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
some
person
who
have
heavy
claim
on
Sir
Percival
,
"
she
answer
,
"
and
who
have
be
the
cause
of
Mr.
Merriman
's
visit
here
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
anything
about
those
claim
?
"
  
"
no
,
I
know
no
particular
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
sign
nothing
,
Laura
,
without
first
look
at
it
?
"
  
"
certainly
not
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
whatever
I
can
harmlessly
and
honestly
do
to
help
him
I
will
do
 
for
the
sake
of
make
your
life
and
mine
,
love
,
as
easy
and
as
happy
as
possible
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
do
nothing
ignorantly
,
which
we
may
,
one
day
,
have
reason
to
feel
ashamed
of
.
<EOS>
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
now
.
<EOS>
You
have
get
your
hat
on
 
<EOS>
suppose
we
go
and
dream
away
the
afternoon
in
the
ground
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
leave
the
house
we
direct
our
step
to
the
near
shade
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
pass
an
open
space
among
the
tree
in
front
of
the
house

there
be
Count
Fosco

nothing

attention
on

home

he
several
time
check
Sir
Percival
's
outbreak
of
temper
,
in
the
most
considerate
manner
towards
me
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
dislike
him
because
he
have
so
much
more
power
over
my
husband
than
I
have
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
hurt
my
pride
to
be
under
any
obligation
to
his
interference

<EOS>
all
I
know
be
,
that
I
do
dislike
him

the
rest
of
the
day
and
evening
pass
quietly
enough
.
<EOS>
the
Count
and
I
play
at
chess
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
two
game
he
politely
allow
me
to
conquer
him
,
and
then
,
when
he
see
that
I
have
find
him
out
,
beg
my
pardon
,
and
at
the
third
game
checkmate
me
in
ten
minute
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
never
once
refer
,
all
through
the
evening
,
to
the
lawyer
's
visit
.
<EOS>
but
either
that
event
,
or
something
else
,
have
produce
a
singular
alteration
for
the
well
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
polite
and
agreeable
to
all
of
us
,
as
he
use
to
be
in
the
day
of
his
probation
at
Limmeridge
,
and
he
be
so
amazingly
attentive
and
kind
to
his
wife
,
that
even
icy
Madame
Fosco
be
rouse
into
look
at
him
with
a
grave
surprise
.
<EOS>
what
do
this
mean
?
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
guess
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
Laura
can
guess
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
Count
Fosco
know
.
<EOS>
I
catch
Sir
Percival
look
at
him
for
approval
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
June
17th
.
 
<EOS>
a
day
of
event
.
<EOS>
I
most
fervently
hope
I
may
not
have
to
add
,
a
day
of
disaster
as
well
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
be
as
silent
at
breakfast
as
he
have
be
the
evening
before
,
on
the
subject
of
the
mysterious
"
arrangement
"
(
as
the
lawyer
call
it
)
which
be
hang
over
our
head
.
<EOS>
an
hour
afterwards
,
however
,
he
suddenly
enter
the
morning
-
room
,
where
his
wife
and
I
be
wait
,
with
our
hat
on
,
for
Madame
Fosco
to
join
us
,
and
inquire
for
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
expect
to
see
him
here
directly
,
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
"
Sir
Percival
go
on
,
walk
nervously
about
the
room
,
"
I
want
Fosco
and
his
wife
in
the
library
,
for
a
mere
business
formality
,

I
want
you
there
,
Laura
,
for
a
minute
too
.
"
<EOS>
He
stop
,
and
appear
to
notice
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
we
be
in
our
walking
costume
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
just
come
in
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
"
or
be
you
just
go
out
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
all
think
of
go
to
the
lake
this
morning
,
"
say
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
have
any
other
arrangement
to
propose
 
"
  
"
no
,
no
,
"
he
answer
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
My
arrangement
can
wait
.
<EOS>
after
lunch
will
do
as
well
for
it
as
after
breakfast
.
<EOS>
all
go
to
the
lake
,
eh
?
<EOS>
a
good
idea
.
<EOS>
let
's
have
an
idle
morning
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
mistake
his
manner
,
even
if
it
have
be
possible
to
mistake
the
uncharacteristic
readiness
which
his
word
express
,
to
submit
his
own
plan
and
project
to
the
convenience
of
other
.
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
relieve
at
find
any
excuse
for
delay
the
business
formality
in
the
library
,
to
which
his
own
word
have
refer
.
<EOS>
My
heart
sink
within
me
as
I
draw
the
inevitable
inference
.
  
<EOS>
the
Count
and
his
wife
join
us
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
the
lady
have
her
husband
's
embroidered
tobacco
-
pouch
,
and
her
store
of
paper
in
her
hand
,
for
the
manufacture
of
the
eternal
cigarette
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
dress
,
as
usual
,
in
his
blouse
and
straw
hat
,
carry
the
gay
little
pagoda
-
cage
,
with
his
darle
white
mouse
in
it
,
and
smile
on
them
,
and
on
us
,
with
a
bland
amiability
which
it
be
impossible
to
resist
.
  
<EOS>
"
with
your
kind
permission
,
"
say
the
Count
,
"
I
will
take
my
small
family
here
 
my
poor
-
little
-
harmless
-
pretty
-
Mouseys
,
out
for
an
airing
along
with
us
.
<EOS>
there
be
dog
about
the
house
,
and
shall
I
leave
my
forlorn
white
child
at
the
mercy
of
the
dog
?
<EOS>
ah
,
never
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
chirrup
paternally
at
his
small
white
child
through
the
bar
of
the
pagoda
,
and
we
all
leave
the
house
for
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
plantation
Sir
Percival
stray
away
from
us
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
part
of
his
restless
disposition
always
to
separate
himself
from
his
companion
on
these
occasion
,
and
always
to
occupy
himself
when
he
be
alone
in
cut
new
walking
-
stick
for
his
own
use
.
<EOS>
the
mere
act
of
cut
and
lop
at
hazard
appear
to
please
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
fill
the
house
with
walking
-
stick
of
his
own
making
,
not
one
of
which
he
ever
take
up
for
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
when
they
have
be
once
use
his
interest
in
them
be
all
exhausted
,
and
he
think
of
nothing
but
go
on
and
make
more
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
old
boat
-
house
he
join
us
again
.
<EOS>
I
will
put
down
the
conversation
that
ensue
when
we
be
all
settle
in
our
place
exactly
as
it
pass
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
important
conversation
,
so
far
as
I
be
concern
,
for
it
have
seriously
dispose
me
to
distrust
the
influence
which
Count
Fosco
have
exercise
over
my
thought
and
feeling
,
and
to
resist
it
for
the
future
as
resolutely
as
I
can
.
  
<EOS>
the
boat
-
house
be
large
enough
to
hold
us
all
,
but
Sir
Percival
remain
outside
trim
the
last
new
stick
with
his
pocket
-
axe
.
<EOS>
We
three
woman
find
plenty
of
room
on
the
large
seat
.
<EOS>
Laura
take
her
work
,
and
Madame
Fosco
begin
her
cigarette
.
<EOS>
I
,
as
usual
,
have
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
My
hand
always
be
,
and
always
will
be
,
as
awkward
as
a
man
's
.
<EOS>
the
Count
good
-
humouredly
take
a
stool
<EOS>
many
size
too
small
for
him
,
and
balance
himself
on
it
with
his
back
against
the
side
of
the
shed
,
which
creak
and
groan
under
his
weight
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
pagoda
-
cage
on
his
lap
,
and
let
out
the
mouse
to
crawl
over
him
as
usual
.
<EOS>
They
be
pretty
,
innocent
-
look
little
creature
,
but
the
sight
of
them
creep
about
a
man
's
body
be
for
some
reason
not
pleasant
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
excite
a
strange
responsive
creeping
in
my
own
nerve
,
and
suggest
hideous
idea
of
man
die
in
prison
with
the
crawling
creature
of
the
dungeon
prey
on
them
undisturbed
.
  
<EOS>
the
morning
be
windy
and
cloudy
,
and
the
rapid
alternation
of
shadow
and
sunlight
over
the
waste
of
the
lake
make
the
view
look
doubly
wild
,
weird
,
and
gloomy
.
  
<EOS>
"
some
people
call
that
picturesque
,
"
say
Sir
Percival
,
point
over
the
wide
prospect
with
his
half
-
finish
walking
-
stick
.
<EOS>
"
I
call
it
a
blot
on
a
gentleman
's
property

<EOS>
in
my
great
-
grandfather
's
time
the
lake
flow
to
this
place
.
<EOS>
look
at
it
now
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
four
foot
deep
anywhere
,
and
it
be
all
puddle
and
pool
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
afford
to
drain
it
,
and
plant
it
all
over
.

My
bailiff
(
a
superstitious
idiot
)
say
he
be
quite
sure
the
lake
have
a
curse
on
it
,
like
the
Dead
Sea

<EOS>
what
do
you
think
,
Fosco
?

It
look
just
the
place
for
a
murder

do
not
it

<EOS>

My
good
Percival

remonstrate
the
Count

"
what
be
your
solid
english
sense
think
of
?
<EOS>
the
water
be
too
shallow
to
hide
the
body
,
and
there
be
sand
everywhere
to
print
off
the
murderer
's
footstep
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
the
very
bad
place
for
a
murder
that
I
ever
set
my
eye
on
.
"
  
"
Humbug
!

say
Sir
Percival
,
cut
away
fiercely
at
his
stick

<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean

the
dreary
scenery

lonely
situation

the
Count

Laura
look
at
the
Count
with
her
dislike
for
him
appear
a
little
too
plainly
in
her
face

<EOS>
He
be
so
busy
with
his
mouse
that
he
do
not
notice
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to

view
connect
with
anything
so
horrible
as
the
idea
of
murder

she
say

if

Fosco

divide
murderer
into
class

I
think
he
have
be
very
unfortunate
in
his
choice
of
expression

to
describe
them

an
indulgence

have
no

to
describe

have
always
hear
that

truly
good

have
a
horror

My

the

report

Mrs.
Catherick
's
desire
to
conceal
her
visit
to
Blackwater
Park
from
Sir
Percival
's
knowledge
recur
to
my
memory
the
moment
he
put
that
last
question
,
and
I
half
doubt
the
discretion
of
answer
it
;
but
in
my
anxiety
to
quiet
the
general
alarm
,
I
have
thoughtlessly
advance
too
far
to
draw
back
,
except
at
the
risk
of
exciting
suspicion
,
which
may
only
make
matter
bad

Sir

inner
end

house
with
Count
Fosco

to

from
the
door

<EOS>
but
the
instant
Mrs.
Catherick

pass
my
lip
he
push
by
the
Count
roughly
,
and
place
himself
face
to
face
with
me
under
the
open
daylight

<EOS>
"
how
come

half
anger
,
half
startle
me

<EOS>

She
know

quietly

<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
he
put
the
question
be
even
more
offensive
than
the
language
in
which
he
express
it
.
<EOS>
I
mark
my
sense
of
his
want
of
common
politeness
by
silently
turn
away
from
him

<EOS>
just
as
I
move
the
Count

persuasive

be
lay
on
his

the
Count

offer

I

out

I
should
like

so

interpose
again

"
in

why

to
the
fountain

head
of
information
at

<EOS>

quite
right
!

say
Sir

<EOS>
"
of
course
the

be
the
first
person
to
question

<EOS>
excessively
stupid
of
me
not
to
see
it
myself
.
<EOS>
"
with
those
word
he
instantly
leave
us
to
return
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
motive
of
the
Count
's
interference
,
which
have
puzzle
me
at
first
,
betray
itself
when
Sir
Percival
's
back
be
turn
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
host
of
question
to
put
to
me
about
Mrs.
Catherick
,
and
the
cause
of
her
visit
to
Blackwater
Park
,
which
he
could
scarcely
have
ask
in
his
friend
's
presence
.
<EOS>
I
make
my
answer
as
short
as
I
civilly
could
,
for
I
have
already
determine
to
check
the
least
approach
to
any
exchanging
of
confidence
between
Count
Fosco
and
myself
.
<EOS>
Laura
,
however
,
unconsciously
help
him
to
extract
all
my
information
,
by
make
inquiry
herself
,
which
leave
me
no
alternative
but
to
reply
to
her
,
or
to
appear
in
the
very
unenviable
and
very
false
character
of
a
depositary
of
Sir
Percival
's
secret
.
<EOS>
the
end
of
it
be
,
that
,
in
about
ten
minute
'
time
,
the
Count
know
as
much
as
I
know
of
Mrs.
Catherick
,
and
of
the
event
which
have
so
strangely
connect
us
with
her
daughter
,
Anne
,
from
the
time
when
Hartright
meet
with
her
to
this
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
effect
of
my
information
on
him
be
,
in
one
respect
,
curious
enough
.
  
<EOS>
intimately
as
he
know
Sir
Percival
,
and
closely
as
he
appear
to
be
associate
with
Sir
Percival
's
private
affair
in
general
,
he
be
certainly
as
far
as
I
be
from
know
anything
of
the
true
story
of
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
the
unsolved
mystery
in
connection
with
this
unhappy
woman
be
now
render
doubly
suspicious
,
in
my
eye
,
by
the
absolute
conviction
which
I
feel
,
that
the
clue
to
it
have
be
hide
by
Sir
Percival
from
the
most
intimate
friend
he
have
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
mistake
the
eager
curiosity
of
the
Count
's
look
and
manner
while
he
drink
in
greedily
every
word
that
fall
from
my
lip
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
kind
of
curiosity
,
I
know
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
misinterpret
the
curiosity
of
blank
surprise
<EOS>
:
if
I
ever
see
it
in
my
life
I
see
it
in
the
Count
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
question
and
answer
be
go
on
,
we
have
all
be
stroll
quietly
back
through
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
reach
the
house
the
first
object
that
we
see
in
front
of
it
be
Sir
Percival
's
dog
-
cart
,
with
the
horse
put
to
and
the
groom
wait
by
it
in
his
stable
-
jacket
.
<EOS>
if
these
unexpected
appearance
be
to
be
trust
,
the
examination
of
the
house
-
keeper
have
produce
important
result
already
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
fine
horse
,
my
friend
,
"
say
the
Count
,
address
the
groom
with
the
most
engaging
familiarity
of
manner
,
"
You
be
go
to
drive
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
,
sir
,
"
reply
the
man
,
look
at
his
stable
-
jacket
,
and
evidently
wonder
whether
the
foreign
gentleman
take
it
for
his
livery
.
<EOS>
"
My
master
drive
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
aha
!
"
say
the
Count
,
"
do
he
indeed
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
he
give
himself
the
trouble
when
he
have
get
you
to
drive
for
him
.
<EOS>
be
he
go
to
fatigue
that
nice
,
shining
,
pretty
horse
by
take
him
very
far
to
-
day
?

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,

answer
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
horse
be
a
mare

if
you
please

your

Brown

for

long

logical
inference

Miss
Halcombe

"
continue
the
Count
,
wheel
round
briskly
,
and
address
me
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
be
go
a
long
distance
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
reply
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
own
inference
to
draw
,
from
what
I
know
through
the
housekeeper
and
from
what
I
see
before
me
,
and
I
do
not
choose
to
share
them
with
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
when
Sir
Percival
be
in
Cumberland
(
I
think
to
myself
)
,
he
walk
away
a
long
distance
,
on
Anne
's
account
,
to
question
the
family
at
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
now
he
be
in
Hampshire
,
be
he
go
to
drive
away
a
long
distance
,
on
Anne
's
account
again
,
to
question
Mrs.
Catherick
at
Welmingham
?
  
<EOS>
We
all
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
as
we
cross
the
hall
Sir
Percival
come
out
from
the
library
to
meet
us
.
<EOS>
He
look
hurried
and
pale
and
anxious
 
but
for
all
that
,
he
be
in
his
most
polite
mood
when
he
speak
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
say
I
be
oblige
to
leave
you
,
"
he
begin
 
"
a
long
drive
 
a
matter
that
I
can
not
very
well
put
off
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
back
in
good
time
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
but
before
I
go
I
should
like
that
little
business
-
formality
,
which
I
speak
of
this
morning
,
to
be
settle
.
<EOS>
Laura
,
will
you
come
into
the
library
?
<EOS>
It
will
not
take
a
minute
 
a
mere
formality
.
<EOS>
Countess
,
may
I
trouble
you
also
?
<EOS>
I
want
you
and
the
Countess
,
Fosco
,
to
be
witness
to
a
signature
 
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
come
in
at
once
and
get
it
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
hold
the
library
door
open
until
they
have
pass
in
,
follow
them
,
and
shut
it
softly
.
  
<EOS>
I
remain
,
for
a
moment
afterwards
,
stand
alone
in
the
hall
,
with
my
heart
beat
fast
and
<EOS>
my
mind
misgive
me
sadly
.
<EOS>
then
I
go
on
to
the
staircase
,
and
ascend
slowly
to
my
own
room
.
    
<EOS>
June
17th
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
my
hand
be
on
the
door
of
my
room
,
I
hear
Sir
Percival
's
voice
call
to
me
from
below
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
beg
you
to
come
downstairs
again
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
Fosco
's
fault
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
not
mine
.
<EOS>
He
have
start
some
nonsensical
objection
to
his
wife
be
one
of
the
witness
,
and
have
oblige
me
to
ask
you
to
join
us
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
enter
the
room
immediately
with
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
Laura
be
wait
by
the
writing
-
table
,
twist
and
turn
her
garden
hat
uneasily
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
sit
near
her
,
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
imperturbably
admire
her
husband
,
who
stand
by
himself
at
the
other
end
of
the
library
,
pick
off
the
dead
leave
from
the
flower
in
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
I
appear
the
Count
advance
to
meet
me
,
and
to
offer
his
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
thousand
pardon
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
character
which
be
give
to
my
countryman
by
the
English
?
<EOS>
We
Italians
be
all
wily
and
suspicious
by
nature
,
in
the
estimation
of
the
good
John
Bull
.
<EOS>
set
me
down
,
if
you
please
,
as
be
no
well
than
the
rest
of
my
race
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
wily
italian
and
a
suspicious
Italian
.
<EOS>
You
have
think
so
yourself
,
dear
lady
,
have
you
not
?
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
it
be
part
of
my
wiliness
and
part
of
my
suspicion
to
object
to
Madame
Fosco
be
a
witness
to
Lady
Glyde
's
signature
,
when
I
be
also
a
witness
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
his
objection
,
"
interpose
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
explain
to
him
that
the
law
of
England
allow
Madame
Fosco
to
witness
a
signature
as
well
as
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
admit
it
,
"
resume
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
the
law
of
England
say
,
yes
,
but
the
conscience
of
Fosco
say
,
no
.
"
<EOS>
He
spread
out
his
fat
finger
on
the
bosom
of
his
blouse
,
and
bow
solemnly
,
as
if
he
wish
to
introduce
his
conscience
to
us
all
,
in
the
character
of
an
illustrious
addition
to
the
society
.
<EOS>
"
what
this
document
which
Lady
Glyde
be
about
to
sign
may
be
,
"
he
continue
,
"
I
neither
know
nor
desire
to
know
.
<EOS>
I
only
say
this
,
circumstance
may
happen
in
the
future
which
may
oblige
Percival
,
or
his
representative
,
to
appeal
to
the
two
witness
,
in
which
case
it
be
certainly
desirable
that
those
witness
should
represent
two
opinion
which
be
perfectly
independent
the
one
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
this
can
not
be
if
my
wife
sign
as
well
as
myself
,
because
we
have
but
one
opinion
between
us
,
and
that
opinion
be
mine
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
have
it
cast
in
my
tooth
,
at
some
future
day
,
that
Madame
Fosco
act
under
my
coercion
,
and
be
,
in
plain
fact
,
no
witness
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
speak
in
Percival
's
interest
,
when
I
propose
that
my
name
shall
appear
(
as
the
near
friend
of
the
husband
)
,
and
your
name
,
Miss
Halcombe
(
as
the
near
friend
of
the
wife
)
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
Jesuit
,
if
you
please
to
think
<EOS>
so
 
a
splitter
of
straw
 
a
man
of
trifle
and
crochet
and
scruple
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
humour
me
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
in
merciful
consideration
for
my
suspicious
italian
character

my
uneasy
italian
conscience

<EOS>
He
bow
again
,
step
back
a
few
pace
,
and
withdraw
his
conscience
from
our
society
as
politely
as
he
have
introduce
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
Count
's
scruple
may
have
be
honourable
and
reasonable
enough
,
but
there
be
something
in
his
manner
of
express
them
which
increase
my
unwillingness
to
be
concern
in
the
business
of
the
signature
.
<EOS>
no
consideration
of
less
importance
than
my
consideration
for
Laura
would
have
induce
me
to
consent
to
be
a
witness
at
all

<EOS>
one
look

however

at

anxious
face
decide
me

anything

desert
her

Sir

at

go
back
to

puff
little

of
smoke
at

in

state
of

deep
anxiety
about

He

but
the
expression
of
distress
in

turn

venture

silent

draw
his

from
under

slowly

away
from
the
Count

eye

doggedly
look
down
for
a
little
while
at
the
parchment
on
the
table

then
speak
,
with
the
sullen
submission
of
a
tamed
animal

rather
than
the
become
resignation

convinced
man

I
do
not

suppress

It
be

hard

treat
Count
Fosco

scruple
so
much
more
indulgently

you
have
treat
mine

this
unfortunate

yet
most
natural

reference
to
the
Count
's
extraordinary
power
over
her
husband

indirect
as
it
be

throw
down

expression
in

eye

,
throughout
all
my
experience
of
her
,
I
have
never
see
in
them
before
,
and
turn
her
back
on
him
in
dead
silence
.
  
<EOS>
this
strong
expression
of
the
most
open
and
the
most
bitter
contempt
be
so
entirely
unlike
herself

so
utterly
out
of

that
it
silence
us
all

<EOS>
there
be
something
hide
,
beyond
a
doubt

under
the
mere
surface
-
brutality
of
the
word
which
her
husband
have
just
address
to
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
lurk
insult
beneath
them
,
of
which
I
be
wholly
ignorant

which
have
leave
the
mark
of
its
profanation
so
plainly
on

face

even
a

may
have
see
it

<EOS>
the
Count
,
who
be
no

see
it
as
distinctly

I
do

when

leave

whisper
under

Laura
walk
before

once
more

positively

in
the
altered
tone

be
conscious

let
his

licence
of
language
seriously
injure
him

firmly

Sir

<EOS>
Laura
have
take
my
arm
while
he
be
speak
<EOS>
and
she
press
it
significantly
when
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
a
hard
trial
to
any
woman
to
stand
by
and
see
the
office
of
apologist
for
her
husband
's
misconduct
quietly
assume
by
his
male
friend
in
her
own
house
 
<EOS>

it
be
a
trial
to
HER
.
<EOS>
I
thank
the
Count
civilly
,
and
let
her
out
.
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
I
thank
him
:
<EOS>
for
I
feel
already
,
with
a
sense
of
inexpressible
helplessness
and
humiliation
,
that
it
be
either
his
interest
or
his
caprice
to
make
sure
of
my
continue
to
reside
at
Blackwater
Park
,
and
I
know
after
Sir
Percival
's
conduct
to
me
,
that
without
the
support
of
the
Count
's
influence
,
I
could
not
hope
to
remain
there
.
<EOS>
His
influence
,
the
influence
of
all
other
that
I
dread
most
,
be
actually
the
one
tie
which
now
hold
me
to
Laura
in
the
hour
of
her
utmost
need
!
  
<EOS>
We
hear
the
wheel
of
the
dog
-
cart
crash
on
the
gravel
of
the
drive
as
we
come
into
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
start
on
his
journey
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
he
go
to
,
Marian
?
"
<EOS>
Laura
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
every
fresh
thing
he
do
seem
to
terrify
me
about
the
future

<EOS>
have
you
any
suspicion
?
"
  
<EOS>
after
what
she
have
undergo
that
morning
,
I
be
unwilling
to
tell
her
my
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
should
I
know
his
secret
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
evasively
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
the
housekeeper
know
?
"
<EOS>
she
persist
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
not
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
quite
as
ignorant
as
we
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
shake
her
head
doubtfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
not
hear
from
the
housekeeper
that
there
be
a
report
of
Anne
Catherick
have
be
see
in

neighbourhood

do
not
you
think
he
may
have
go
away
to
look
for
her
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
compose
myself
,
Laura
,
by
not
think
about
it
at
all
,
and
after
what
have
happen
,
you
have
well
follow
my
example

<EOS>
come
into
my
room
,
and
rest
and
quiet
yourself
a
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
sit
down
together
close
to
the
window
,
and
let
the
fragrant
summer
air
breathe
over
our
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
ashamed
to
look
at
you
,
Marian
,
"
she
say
,
"
after
what
you
submit
to
downstairs
,
for
my
sake

<EOS>
oh
,
my
own
love
,
I
be
almost
heartbroken
when
I
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
but
I
will
try
to
make
it
up
to
you
 
I
will
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
hush
!
"
<EOS>
I
reply
;
"
do
not
talk
so
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
trifle
mortification
of
my
pride
compare
to
the
dreadful
sacrifice
of
your
happiness
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
hear
what
he
say
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
go
on
quickly
and
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
You
hear
the
word
 
but
you
do
not
know
what
they
mean
 
you
do
not
know
why
I
throw
down
the
pen
and
turn
my
back
on
him
.
"
<EOS>
She
rise
in
sudden
agitation
,
and
walk
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
keep
many
thing
from
your
knowledge
,
Marian
,
for
fear
of
distress
you
,
and
make
you
unhappy
at
the
outset
of
our
new
life

You
do
not
know
how
he
have
use
me

<EOS>
and
yet
you
ought
to
know
,
for
you
see
how
he
use
me
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
You
hear
him
sneer
at
my
presuming
to
be
scrupulous
 
<EOS>
you
hear
him
say
I
have
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
in
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
sit
down
again
,
her
face
flush
deeply
,
and
her
hand
twist
and
twine
together
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
about
it
now
,
"
she
say
;
"
I
shall
burst
out
cry
if
I
tell
you
now
 
later
,
<EOS>
Marian
,
when
I
be
more
sure
of
myself
.
<EOS>
My
poor
head
ache
,
darle
 
ache
,
ache
,
ache
.
<EOS>
where
be
your
smelling
-
bottle
?
<EOS>
let
me
talk
to
you
about
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
give
him
my
signature
,
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
give
it
to
him
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
I
would
rather
compromise
myself
than
compromise
you
.
<EOS>
after
your
take
my
part
against
him
,
he
will
lay
all
the
blame
on
you
if
I
refuse
again
.
<EOS>
what
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
oh
,
for
a
friend
to
help
us
and
advise
us
!
 
<EOS>
a
friend
we
could
really
trust
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
sigh
bitterly
.
<EOS>
I
see
in
her
face
that
she
be
think
of
Hartright
 
<EOS>
see
it
the
more
plainly
because
her
last
word
set
me
think
of
him
too
.
<EOS>
in
six
month
only
from
her
marriage
we
want
the
faithful
service
he
have
offer
to
us
in
his
farewell
word
.
<EOS>
how
little
I
once
think
that
we
should
ever
want
it
at
all
!
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
do
what
we
can
to
help
ourselves
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
let
us
try
to
talk
it
over
calmly
,
Laura
 
let
us
do
all
in
our
power
to
decide
for
the
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
put
what
she
know
of
her
husband
's
embarrassment
and
what
I
have
hear
of
his
conversation
with
the
lawyer
together
,
we
arrive
necessarily
at
the
conclusion
that
the
parchment
in
the
library
have
be
draw
up
for
the
purpose
of
borrow
money
,
and
that
Laura
's
signature
be
absolutely
necessary
to
fit
it
for
the
attainment
of
Sir
Percival
's
object
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
question
,
concern
the
nature
of
the
legal
contract
by
which
the
money
be
to
be
obtain
,
and
the
degree
of
personal
responsibility
to
which
Laura
may
subject
herself
if
she
sign
it
in
the
dark
,
involved
consideration
which
lie
far
beyond
any
knowledge
and
experience
that
either
of
us
possess
.
<EOS>
My
own
conviction
lead
me
to
believe
that
the
hide
content
of
the
parchment
conceal
a
transaction
of
the
mean
and
the
most
fraudulent
kind
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
form
this
conclusion
in
consequence
of
Sir
Percival
's
refusal
to
show
the
writing
or
to
explain
it
,
for
that
refusal
may
well
have
proceed
from
his
obstinate
disposition
and
his
domineering
temper
alone
.
<EOS>
My
sole
motive
for
distrust
his
honesty
spring
from
the
change
which
I
have
observe
in
his
language
and
his
manner
at
Blackwater
Park
,
a
change
which
convince
me
that
he
have
be
act
a
part
throughout
the
whole
period
of
his
probation
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
His
elaborate
delicacy
,
his
ceremonious
politeness
which
harmonise
so
agreeably
with
Mr.
Gilmore
's
old
-
fashioned
notion
,
his
modesty
with
Laura
,
his
candour
with
me
,
his
moderation
with
Mr.
Fairlie
 
all
these
be
the
artifice
of
a
mean
,
cunning
,
and
brutal
man
,
who
have
drop
his
disguise
when
his
practise
duplicity
have
gain
its
end
,
and
have
openly
show
himself
in
the
library
on
that
very
day
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
the
grief
which
this
discovery
cause
me
on
Laura
's
account
,
for
it
be
not
to
be
express
by
any
word
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
only
refer
to
it
at
all
,
because
it
decide
me
to
oppose
her
sign
the
parchment
,
whatever
the
consequence
may
be
,
unless
she
be
first
make
acquaint
with
the
content
.
  
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
the
one
chance
for
us
when
to
-
morrow
come
be
to
be
provide
with
an
objection
to
give
the
signature
,
which
may
rest
on
sufficiently
firm
commercial
or
legal
ground
to
shake
Sir
Percival
's
resolution
,
and
to
make
him
suspect
that
we
two
woman
understand
the
law
and
obligation
of
business
as
well
as
himself
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
pondering
,
I
determine
to
write
to
the
only
honest
man
within
reach
whom
we
could
trust
to
help
us
discreetly
in
our
forlorn
situation
.
<EOS>
that
man
be
Mr.
Gilmore
's
partner
,
Mr.
Kyrle
,
who
conduct
the
business
now
that
our
old
friend
have
be
oblige
to
withdraw
from
it
,
and
to
leave
London
on
account
of
his
health
.
<EOS>
I
explain
to
Laura
that
I
have
Mr.
Gilmore
's
own
authority
for
place
implicit
confidence
in
his
partner
's
integrity
,
discretion
,
and
accurate
knowledge
of
all
her
affair
,
and
with
her
full
approval
I
sit
down
at
once
to
write
the
letter
,
I
begin
by
state
our
position
to
Mr.
Kyrle
exactly
as
it
be
,
and
then
ask
for
his
advice
in
return
,
express
in
plain
,
downright
term
which
he
could
comprehend
without
any
danger
of
misinterpretation
and
mistake
.
<EOS>
My
letter
be
as
short
as
I
could
possibly
make
it
,
and
be
,
I
hope
,
unencumbered
by
needless
apology
and
needless
detail
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
I
be
about
to
put
the
address
on
the
envelope
an
obstacle
be
discover
by
Laura
,
which
in
the
effort
and
preoccupation
of
writing
have
escape
my
mind
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
we
to
get
the
answer
in
time
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
<EOS>
"
Your
letter
will
not
be
deliver
in
London
before
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
the
post
will
not
bring
the
reply
here
till
the
morning
after
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
only
way
of
overcome
this
difficulty
be
to
have
the
answer
bring
to
us
from
the
lawyer
's
office
by
a
special
messenger
.
<EOS>
I
write
a
postscript
to
that
effect
,
beg
that
the
messenger
may
be
despatch
with
the
reply
by
the
eleven
o'clock
morning
train
,
which
would
bring
him
to
our
station
at
twenty
minute
past
one
,
and
so
enable
him
to
reach
Blackwater
Park
by
two
o'clock
at
the
late
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
be
direct
to
ask
for
me
,
to
answer
no
question
address
to
him
by
any
one
else
,
and
to
deliver
his
letter
into
no
hand
but
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
case
Sir
Percival
should
come
back
to
-
morrow
before
two
o'clock
,
"
I
say
to
Laura
,
"
the
wise
plan
for
you
to
adopt
be
to
be
out
in
the
ground
all
the
morning
with
your
book
or
your
work
,
and
not
to
appear
at
the
house
till
the
messenger
have
have
time
to
arrive
with
the
letter
.
<EOS>
I
will
wait
here
for
him
all
the
morning
,
to
guard
against
any
misadventure
or
mistake

I

and
believe
we
shall
avoid
be
take
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
let
us
go
down
to
the
drawing
-
room
now
.
<EOS>
We
may
excite
suspicion
if
we
remain
shut
up
together
too
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
suspicion
?
<EOS>
"
she
repeat
.
<EOS>
"
whose
suspicion
can
we
excite
,
now
that
Sir
Percival
have
leave
the
house
?
<EOS>
do
you
mean
Count
Fosco
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
do
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
begin
to
dislike
him
as
much
as
I
do
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
not
to
dislike
him
.
<EOS>
Dislike
be
always
more
or
less
associated
with
contempt
 
<EOS>
I
can
see
nothing
in
the
Count
to
despise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
afraid
of
him
,
be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
be
 
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
afraid
of
him
,
after
his
interference
in
our
favour
to
-
day
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
be
more
afraid
of
his
interference
than
I
be
of
Sir
Percival
's
violence
.
<EOS>
remember
what
I
say
to
you
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
whatever
you
do
,
Laura
,
do
not
make
an
enemy
of
the
Count
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
go
downstairs
.
<EOS>
Laura
enter
the
drawing
-
room
,
while
I
proceed
across
the
hall
,
with
my
letter
in
my
hand
,
to
put
it
into
the
post
-
bag
,
which
hang
against
the
wall
opposite
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
house
door
be
open
,
and
as
I
cross
past
it
,
I
see
Count
Fosco
and
his
wife
stand
talk
together
on
the
step
outside
,
with
their
face
turn
towards
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
Countess
come
into
the
hall
rather
hastily
,
and
ask
if
I
have
leisure
enough
for
five
minute
'
private
conversation
.
<EOS>
feel
a
little
surprised
by
such
an
appeal
from
such
a
person
,
I
put
my
letter
into
the
bag
,
and
reply
that
I
be
quite
at
her
disposal
.
<EOS>
She
take
my
arm
with
unaccustomed
friendliness
and
familiarity
,
and
instead
of
lead
me
into
an
empty
room
,
draw
me
out
with
her
to
the
belt
of
turf
which
surround
the
large
fish
-
pond
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
pass
the
Count
on
the
step
he
bow
and
smile
,
and
then
go
at
once
into
the
house
,
push
the
hall
door
to
after
him
,
but
not
actually
close
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
Countess
walk
me
gently
round
the
fish
-
pond
.
<EOS>
I
expect
to
be
make
the
depositary
of
some
extraordinary
confidence
,
and
I
be
astonish
to
find
that
Madame
Fosco
's
communication
for
my
private
ear
be
nothing
more
than
a
polite
assurance
of
her
sympathy
for
me
,
after
what
have
happen
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
have
tell
her
of
all
that
have
pass
,
and
of
the
insolent
manner
in
which
Sir
Percival
have
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
this
information
have
so
shock
and
distress
her
,
on
my
account
and
on
Laura
's
,
that
she
have
make
up
her
mind
,
if
anything
of
the
sort
happen
again
,
to
mark
her
sense
of
Sir
Percival
's
outrageous
conduct
by
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
Count
have
approve
of
her
idea
,
and
she
now
hope
that
I
approve
of
it
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
this
a
very
strange
proceeding
on
the
part
of
such
a
remarkably
reserved
woman
as
Madame
Fosco
,
especially
after
the
interchange
of
sharp
speech
which
have
pass
between
us
during
the
conversation
in
the
boat
-
house
on
that
very
morning
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
my
plain
duty
to
meet
a
polite
and
friendly
advance
on
the
part
of
one
of
my
elder
with
a
polite
and
friendly
reply
.
<EOS>
I
answer
the
Countess
accordingly
in
her
own
tone
,
and
then
,
think
we
have
say
all
that
be
necessary
on
either
side
,
make
an
attempt
to
get
back
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
but
Madame
Fosco
seem
resolve
not
to
part
with
me
,
and
to
my
unspeakable
amazement
,
resolve
also
to
talk
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
the
most
silent
of
woman
,
she
now
persecute
me
with
fluent
conventionality
on
the
subject
of
married
life
,
on
the
subject
of
Sir
Percival
and
Laura
,
on
the
subject
of
her
own
happiness
,
on
the
subject
of
the
late
Mr.
Fairlie
's
conduct
to
her
in
the
matter
of
her
legacy
,
and
on
half
a
dozen
other
subject
besides
,
until
she
have
detain
me
walk
round
and
round
the
fish
-
pond
for
more
than
half
an
hour
,
and
have
quite
weary
me
out
.
<EOS>
whether
she
discover
this
or
not
,
I
can
not
say
,
but
she
stop
as
abruptly
as
she
have
begin
 
look
towards
the
house
door
,
resume
her
icy
manner
in
a
moment
,
and
drop
my
arm
of
her
own
accord
before
I
could
think
of
an
excuse
for
accomplish
my
own
release
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
push
open
the
door
and
enter
the
hall
,
I
find
myself
suddenly
face
to
face
with
the
Count
again
.
<EOS>
He
be
just
put
a
letter
into
the
post
-
bag
.
  
<EOS>
after
he
have
drop
it
in
and
have
close
the
bag
,
he
ask
me
where
I
have
leave
Madame
Fosco
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
and
he
go
out
at
the
hall
door
immediately
to
join
his
wife
.
<EOS>
His
manner
when
he
speak
to
me
be
so
unusually
quiet
and
subdue
that
I
turn
and
look
after
him
,
wonder
if
he
be
ill
or
out
of
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
why
my
next
proceeding
be
to
go
straight
up
to
the
post
-
bag
and
take
out
my
own
letter
and
look
at
it
again
,
with
a
vague
distrust
on
me
,
and
why
the
look
at
it
for
the
second
time
instantly
suggest
the
idea
to
my
mind
of
seal
the
envelope
for
its
great
security
 
be
mystery
which
be
either
too
deep
or
too
shallow
for
me
to
fathom
.
<EOS>
woman
,
as
everybody
know
,
constantly
act
on
impulse
which
they
can
not
explain
even
to
themselves
,
and
I
can
only
suppose
that
one
of
those
impulse
be
the
hide
cause
of
my
unaccountable
conduct
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
whatever
influence
animate
me
,
I
find
cause
to
congratulate
myself
on
have
obey
it
as
soon
as
I
prepare
to
seal
the
letter
in
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
I
have
originally
close
the
envelope
in
the
usual
way
by
moisten
the
adhesive
point
and
press
it
on
the
paper
beneath
,
and
when
I
now
try
it
with
my
finger
,
after
a
lapse
of
full
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
,
the
envelope
open
on
the
instant
,
without
stick
or
tearing
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
have
fasten
it
insufficiently
?
<EOS>
perhaps
there
may
have
be
some
defect
in
the
adhesive
gum
?
  
<EOS>
or
,
perhaps
 
no
!
<EOS>
it
be
quite
revolt
enough
to
feel
that
third
conjecture
stir
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
not
see
it
confront
me
in
plain
black
and
white
.
  
<EOS>
I
almost
dread
to
-
morrow
 
so
much
depend
on
my
discretion
and
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
precaution
,
at
all
event
,
which
I
be
sure
not
to
forget
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
careful
to
keep
up
friendly
appearance
with
the
Count
,
and
I
must
be
well
on
my
guard
when
the
messenger
from
the
office
come
here
with
the
answer
to
my
letter
.
    
<EOS>
June
17th
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
dinner
hour
bring
us
together
again
,
Count
Fosco
be
in
his
usual
excellent
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
exert
himself
to
interest
and
amuse
us
,
as
if
he
be
determined
to
efface
from
our
memory
all
recollection
of
what
have
pass
in
the
library
that
afternoon
.
<EOS>
lively
description
of
his
adventure
in
travel
,
amusing
anecdote
of
remarkable
people
whom
he
have
meet
with
abroad
,
quaint
comparison
between
the
social
custom
of
various
nation
,
illustrate
by
example
draw
from
man
and
woman
indiscriminately
all
over
Europe
,
humorous
confession
of
the
innocent
folly
of
his
own
early
life
,
when
he
rule
the
fashion
of
a
second
-
rate
italian
town
,
and
write
preposterous
romance
on
the
french
model
for
a
second
-
rate
italian
newspaper
 
all
flow
in
succession
so
easily
and
so
gaily
from
his
lip
,
and
all
address
our
various
curiosity
and
various
interest
so
directly
and
so
delicately
,
that
Laura
and
I
listen
to
him
with
as
much
attention
and
,
inconsistent
as
it
may
seem
,
with
as
much
admiration
also
,
as
Madame
Fosco
herself
.
<EOS>
woman
can
resist
a
man
's
love
,
a
man
's
fame
,
a
man
's
personal
appearance
,
and
a
man
's
money
,
but
they
can
not
resist
a
man
's
tongue
when
he
know
how
to
talk
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
while
the
favourable
impression
which
he
have
produce
on
us
be
still
vivid
in
our
mind
,
the
Count
modestly
withdraw
to
read
in
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
Laura
propose
a
stroll
in
the
ground
to
enjoy
the
close
of
the
long
evening
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
in
common
politeness
to
ask
Madame
Fosco
to
join
us
,
but
this
time
she
have
apparently
receive
her
order
beforehand
,
and
she
beg
we
would
kindly
excuse
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Count
will
probably
want
a
fresh
supply
of
cigarette
,
"
she
remark
by
way
of
apology
,
"
and
nobody
can
make
them
to
his
satisfaction
but
myself
.
"
<EOS>
Her
cold
blue
eye
almost
warm
as
she
speak
the
word
 
she
look
actually
proud
of
be
the
officiate
medium
through
which
her
lord
and
master
compose
himself
with
tobacco
-
smoke
!
  
<EOS>
Laura
and
I
go
out
together
alone
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
misty
,
heavy
evening
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
sense
of
blight
in
the
air
;
the
flower
be
droop
in
the
garden
,
and
the
ground
be
parch
and
dewless
.
<EOS>
the
western
heaven
,
as
we
see
it
over
the
quiet
tree
,
be
of
a
pale
yellow
hue
,
and
the
sun
be
set
faintly
in
a
haze
.
<EOS>
come
rain
seem
near
 
it
would
fall
probably
with
the
fall
of
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
which
way
shall
we
go
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
  
"
towards
the
lake
,
Marian
,
if
you
like
,

she
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
unaccountably
fond
,
Laura
,
of
that
dismal
lake
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
not
of
the
lake
but
of
the
scenery
about
it
.
<EOS>
the
sand
and
heath
and
the
fir
-
tree
be
the
only
object
I
can
discover
,
in
all
this
large
place
,
to
remind
me
of
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
but
we
will
walk
in
some
other
direction
if
you
prefer
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
have
no
favourite
walk
at
Blackwater
Park
,
my
love

<EOS>
one
be
the
same
as
another
to
me
.
<EOS>
let
us
go
to
the
lake
 
<EOS>
we
may
find
it
cool
in
the
open
space
than
we
find
it
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
walk
through
the
shadowy
plantation
in
silence
.
<EOS>
the
heaviness
in
the
evening
air
oppress
us
both
,
and
when
we
reach
the
boat
-
house
we
be
glad
to
sit
down
and
rest
inside
.
  
<EOS>
a
white
fog
hung
low
over
the
lake
.
<EOS>
the
dense
brown
line
of
the
tree
on
the
opposite
bank
appear
above
it
,
like
a
dwarf
forest
float
in
the
sky
.
<EOS>
the
sandy
ground
,
shelve
downward
from
where
we
sit
,
be
lose
mysteriously
in
the
outward
layer
of
the
fog
.
<EOS>
the
silence
be
horrible
.
<EOS>
no
rustling
of
the
leave
 
<EOS>
no
bird
's
note
in
the
wood
 
<EOS>
no
cry
of
water

fowl
from
the
pool
of
the
hide
lake

<EOS>
even
the
croaking
of
the
frog
have
cease
to

night

<EOS>
"
It
be
very
desolate
and
gloomy
,
"
say
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
but
we
can
be
more
alone
here
than
anywhere
else

"
  
<EOS>
She
speak
quietly
and
look
at
the
wilderness
of
sand
and
mist
with
steady
,
thoughtful
eye
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
that
her
mind
be
too
much
occupy
to
feel
the
dreary
impression
from
without
which
have
fasten
themselves
already
on
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
promise
,
Marian
,
to
tell
you
the
truth

my
married

perhaps
a
little
for

confess

I
make

I

the
few
day
we

,
as
well
as
if
I
have
describe
it
in
so
many
word
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
day
at
Rome
when
we
have
ride
out
together
to
the
tomb
of
Cecilia
Metella
.
<EOS>
the
sky
be
calm
and
lovely
,
and
the
grand
old
ruin
look
beautiful
,
and
the
remembrance
that
a
husband
's
love
have
raise
it
in
the
old
time
to
a
wife
's
memory
,
make
me
feel
more
tenderly
and
more
anxiously
towards
my
husband
than
I
have
ever
feel
yet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
build
such
a
tomb
for
me
,
Percival
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
say
you
love
me
dearly
before
we
be
married
,
and
yet
,
since
that
time
 
"
I
could
get
no
farther
.
<EOS>
marian
!
<EOS>
he
be
not
even
look
at
me
!
<EOS>
I
pull
down
my
veil
,
think
it
best
not
to
let
him
see
that
the
tear
be
in
my
eye
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
he
have
not
pay
any
attention
to
me
,
but
he
have
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
come
away
,
"
and
laugh
to
himself
as
he
help
me
on
to
my
horse
.
<EOS>
He
mount
his
own
horse
and
laugh
again
as
we
ride
away
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
do
build
you
a
tomb
,
"
he
say
,
"
it
will
be
do
with
your
own
money
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Cecilia
Metella
have
a
fortune
and
pay
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
make
no
reply
 
how
could
I
,
when
I
be
cry
behind
my
veil
?
"
<EOS>
ah
,
you
light
-
complexioned
woman
be
all
sulky
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
compliment
and
soft
speech
?
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
good
humour
this
morning
.
<EOS>
consider
the
compliment
pay
and
the
speech
say
.
<EOS>
"
man
little
know
when
they
say
hard
thing
to
us
<EOS>
how
well
we
remember
them
,
and
how
much
harm
they
do
us
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
well
for
me
if
I
have
go
on
cry
,
but
his
contempt
dry
up
my
tear
and
harden
my
heart
.
<EOS>
from
that
time
,
Marian
,
I
never
check
myself
again
in
thinking
of
Walter
Hartright
.
<EOS>
I
let
the
memory
of
those
happy
day
,
when
we
be
so
fond
of
each
other
in
secret
,
come
back
and
comfort
me
.
<EOS>
what
else
have
I
to
look
to
for
consolation
?
<EOS>
if
we
have
be
together
you
would
have
help
me
to
well
thing
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
wrong
,
darle
,
but
tell
me
if
I
be
wrong
without
any
excuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
be
oblige
to
turn
my
face
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
ask
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
have
I
suffer
as
you
have
suffer
?
<EOS>
what
right
have
I
to
decide
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
use
to
think
of
him
,
"
she
pursue
,
drop
her
voice
and
move
closer
to
me
,
"
I
use
to
think
of
him
when
Percival
leave
me
alone
at
night
to
go
among
the
Opera
people
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
fancy
what
I
may
have
be
if
it
have
please
God
to
bless
me
with
poverty
,
and
if
I
have
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
see
myself
in
my
neat
cheap
gown
,
sit
at
home
and
wait
for
him
while
he
be
earn
our
bread
 
sit
at
home
and
work
for
him
and
love
him
all
the
well
because
I
have
to
work
for
him
 
see
him
come
in
tired
and
take
off
his
hat
and
coat
for
him
,
and
,
Marian
,
please
him
with
little
dish
at
dinner
that
I
have
learn
to
make
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
hope
he
be
never
lonely
enough
and
sad
enough
to
think
of
me
and
see
me
as
I
have
think
of
him
and
see
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
as
she
say
those
melancholy
word
,
all
the
lose
tenderness
return
to
her
voice
,
and
all
the
lost
beauty
tremble
back
into
her
face
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
rest
as
lovingly
on
the
blight
,
solitary
,
ill
-
omened
view
before
us
,
as
if
they
see
the
friendly
hill
of
Cumberland
in
the
dim
and
threatening
sky
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
speak
of
Walter
any
more
,
"
I
say
,
as
soon
as
I
could
control
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Laura
,
spare
us
both
the
wretchedness
of
talk
of
him
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
rouse
herself
,
and
look
at
me
tenderly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
be
silent
about
him
for
ever
,
"
she
answer
,
"
than
cause
you
a
moment
's
pain
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
in
your
interest
,
"
I
plead
;
"
it
be
for
your
sake
that
I
speak
.
<EOS>
if
your
husband
hear
you
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
would
not
surprise
him
if
he
do
hear
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
make
that
strange
reply
with
a
weary
calmness
and
coldness
.
<EOS>
the
change
in
her
manner
,
when
she
give
the
answer
,
startle
me
almost
as
much
as
the
answer
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
surprise
him
!
"
I
repeat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Laura

<EOS>

"
  
<EOS>
"
It

what
I
want

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hear
her
,
but
I
could
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
Her
last
word
have
kill
the
little
hope
that
still
live
in

<EOS>

It

as
wearily
calm
and
cold
as

We

a
little
party
give

Mrs.

some

prevail
on

<EOS>
We
all
admire
them

something

particularly
to
me

<EOS>
"
surely

"
<EOS>
she
ask
.
<EOS>
"

I

"

<EOS>
I

control
myself
 
<EOS>
I
say
nothing

and
look
down
close
at
the
drawing
.
<EOS>
when
I
venture
to
raise
my

again
,
my

<EOS>
He
lay
an
emphasis
on
the
last
word

We

<EOS>
He

but
the
moment
we
be
in

he
lock

door
,
push
me
down
into
a
chair
,
and
stand
over

<EOS>
"
ever

I

You

I

torment
of
my
remorse
have
close
them
round
her
like

<EOS>

<EOS>
my

<EOS>
the

to
the
heart
in
the
summer
-
house
at
Limmeridge
,
rise
before
me
in
mute
,
unendurable
reproach
.
<EOS>
My
hand
have
point
the
way
which
lead
the
man

step
by
step
,
far
from

<EOS>
between

sunder
them
for

I

<EOS>
I

her
voice
that
she
be
comfort
me
 
I

who
deserve
nothing
but
the
reproach
of
her
silence

<EOS>
how
long
it
be
before
I
master
the
absorb
misery
of
my
own
thought
,
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
I
be
first
conscious
that
she
be
kiss
me
,
and
then
my
eye
seem
to
wake
on
a
sudden
to
their
sense
of
outward
thing

and
I
know
that
I

mechanically
straight

a
minute

I
be
afraid

trust
myself
to
look
at

I
keep
my
eye
fix
on
the
view
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
late
.
<EOS>
the
dense
brown
line
of
tree
in
the
sky
have
fade
in
the
gathering
darkness
to
the
faint
resemblance
of
a
long
wreath
of
smoke
.
<EOS>
the
mist
over
the
lake
below
have
stealthily
enlarge
,
and
advance
on
us

<EOS>
the
silence
be
as
breathless
as
ever

but
the
horror
of
it
have
go
,
and
the
solemn
mystery
of
its
stillness
be
all
that
remain

<EOS>
"
We

far
from

She
stop
suddenly

the
entrance

I
see
it
too

over
the
waste

heath
in
the
distance

darkly
along

minute
elapse
before
Laura

venture
into

make
up
my

.
<EOS>
there
be
really
nothing
to
be
alarm
about
.
<EOS>
the
shore
of
the
lake
be
not
far
from
the
village
,
and
they
be
free
to
any
one
to
walk
on
by
day
or
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
wonderful
we
have
see
no
live
creature
there
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
in
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
dark
 
<EOS>
so
dark
,
that
we
find
some
difficulty
in
keep
the
path
.
<EOS>
I
give
Laura
my
arm
,
and
we
walk
as
fast
as
we
could
on
our
way
back
.
  
<EOS>
before
we
be
half
-
way
through
she
stop
,
and
force
me
to
stop
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
listen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
"
she
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
something
behind
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
dead
leave
,
"
I
say
to
cheer
her
,
"
or
a
twig
blow
off
the
tree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
summer
time
,
Marian
,
and
there
be
not
a
breath
of
wind
.
<EOS>
listen
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
hear
the
sound
too
 
a
sound
like
a
light
footstep
follow
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
matter
who
it
be
,
or
what
it
be
,
"
I
say
,
"
let
us
walk
on
.
<EOS>
in
another
minute
,
if
there
be
anything
to
alarm
us
,
we
shall
be
near
enough
to
the
house
to
be
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
go
on
quickly
 
so
quickly
,
that
Laura
be
breathless
by
the
time
we
be
nearly
through
the
plantation
,
and
within
sight
of
the
light
window
.
  
<EOS>
I
wait
a
moment
to
give
her
breathing
-
time
.
<EOS>
just
as
we
be
about
to
proceed
she
stop
me
again
,
and
sign
to
me
with
her
hand
to
listen
once
more
.
<EOS>
We
both
hear
distinctly
a
long
,
heavy
sigh
behind
us
,
in
the
black
depth
of
the
tree
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
there
?
<EOS>
"
I
call
out
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
there
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
an
instant
of
silence
follow
,
and
then
we
hear
the
light
fall
of
the
footstep
again
,
fainter
and
fainter
 
sink
away
into
the
darkness
 
sinking
,
sinking
,
sink
 
till
they
be
lose
in
the
silence
.
  
<EOS>
We
hurry
out
from
the
tree
to
the
open
lawn
beyond
cross
it
rapidly
;
and
without
another
word
pass
between
us
,
reach
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
light
of
the
hall
-
lamp
Laura
look
at
me
,
with
white
cheek
and
startle
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
half
dead
with
fear
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
who
could
it
have
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
try
to
guess
to
-
morrow
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
in
the
meantime
say
nothing
to
any
one
of
what
we
have
hear
and
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
silence
be
safe
,
and
we
have
need
of
safety
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
send
Laura
upstairs
immediately
,
wait
a
minute
to
take
off
my
hat
and
put
my
hair
smooth
,
and
then
go
at
once
to
make
my
first
investigation
in
the
library
,
on
pretence
of
search
for
a
book
.
  
<EOS>
there
sit
the
Count
,
fill
out
the
large
easy
-
chair
in
the
house
,
smoke
and
read
calmly
,
with
his
foot
on
an
ottoman
,
his
cravat
across
his
knee
,
and
his
shirt
collar
wide
open
.
<EOS>
and
there
sit
Madame
Fosco
,
like
a
quiet
child
,
on
a
stool
by
his
side
,
make
cigarette
.
<EOS>
neither
husband
nor
wife
could
,
by
any
possibility
,
have
be
out
late
that
evening
,
and
have
just
get
back
to
the
house
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
my
object
in
visit
the
library
be
answer
the
moment
I
set
eye
on
them
.
  
<EOS>
Count
Fosco
rise
in
polite
confusion
and
tie
his
cravat
on
when
I
enter
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
let
me
disturb
you
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
come
here
to
get
a
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
unfortunate
man
of
my
size
suffer
from
the
heat
,
"
say
the
Count
,
refresh
himself
gravely
with
a
large
green
fan
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
change
place
with
my
excellent
wife
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
cool
at
this
moment
as
a
fish
in
the
pond
outside
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Countess
allow
herself
to
thaw
under
the
influence
of
her
husband
's
quaint
comparison
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
never
warm
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
she
remark
,
with
the
modest
air
of
a
woman
who
be
confess
to
one
of
her
own
merit
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
and
Lady
Glyde
be
out
this
evening
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
Count
,
while
I
be
take
a
book
from
the
shelf
to
preserve
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
we
go
out
to
get
a
little
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
in
what
direction
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
direction
of
the
lake
 
as
far
as
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aha
?
<EOS>
as
far
as
the
boat
-
house
?
"
  
under
other
circumstance
I
may
have
resent
his
curiosity
.
<EOS>
but
to
-
night
I
hail
it
as
another
proof
that
neither
he
nor
his
wife
be
connect
with
the
mysterious
appearance
at
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
more
adventure
,
I
suppose
,
this
evening
?
<EOS>
"
he
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
no
more
discovery
,
like
your
discovery
of
the
wound
dog
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
fix
his
unfathomable
grey
eye
on
me
,
with
that
cold
,
clear
,
irresistible
glitter
in
them
which
always
force
me
to
look
at
him
,
and
always
make
me
uneasy
while
I
do
look
.
<EOS>
an
unutterable
suspicion
that
his
mind
be
pry
into
mine
overcome
me
at
these
time
,
and
it
overcome
me
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
I
say
shortly
;
"
no
adventure
 
no
discovery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
try
to
look
away
from
him
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
strange
as
it
seem
,
I
hardly
think
I
should
have
succeed
in
the
attempt
if
Madame
Fosco
have
not
help
me
by
cause
him
to
move
and
look
away
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
count
,
you
be
keep
Miss
Halcombe
stand
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
he
turn
round
to
get
me
a
chair
,
I
seize
my
opportunity
 
<EOS>
thank
him
 
make
my
excuse
 
and
slip
out
.
  
<EOS>
an
hour
later
,
when
Laura
's
maid
happen
to
be
in
her
mistress
's
room
,
I
take
occasion
to
refer
to
the
closeness
of
the
night
,
with
a
view
to
ascertain
next
how
the
servant
have
be
pass
their
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
be
suffer
much
from
the
heat
downstairs
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
miss
,
"
say
the
girl
,
"
we
have
not
feel
it
to
speak
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
out
in
the
wood
then
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
some
of
us
think
of
go
,
miss
.
<EOS>
but
cook
say
she
should
take
her
chair
into
the
cool
court
-
yard
,
outside
the
kitchen
door
,
and
on
second
thought
,
all
the
rest
of
us
take
our
chair
out
there
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
be
now
the
only
person
who
remain
to
be
account
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
Mrs.
Michelson
go
to
bed
yet
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
,
miss
,
"
say
the
girl
,
smile
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Michelson
be
more
likely
to
be
get
up
just
now
than
go
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
have
Mrs.
Michelson
be
take
to
her
bed
in
the
daytime
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
miss
,
not
exactly
,
but
the
next
thing
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
be
asleep
all
the
evening
on
the
sofa
in
her
own
room
.
"
  
<EOS>
put
together
what
I
observe
for
myself
in
the
library
,
and
what
I
have
just
hear
from
Laura
's
maid
,
one
conclusion
seem
inevitable
.
<EOS>
the
figure
we
see
at
the
lake
be
not
the
figure
of
Madame
Fosco
,
of
her
husband
,
or
of
any
of
the
servant
.
<EOS>
the
footstep
we
hear
behind
us
be
not
the
footstep
of
any
one
belong
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
who
could
it
have
be
?
  
<EOS>
It
seem
useless
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
even
decide
whether
the
figure
be
a
man
's
or
a
woman
's
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
I
think
it
be
a
woman
's
.
    
<EOS>
June
18th
.
 
<EOS>
the
misery
of
self
-
reproach
which
I
suffer
yesterday
evening
,
on
hear
what
Laura
tell
me
in
the
boat
-
house
,
return
in
the
loneliness
of
the
night
,
and
keep
me
wake
and
wretche
for
hour
.
  
<EOS>
I
light
my
candle
at
last
,
and
search
through
my
old
journal
to
see
what
my
share
in
the
fatal
error
of
her
marriage
have
really
be
,
and
what
I
may
have
once
do
to
save
her
from
it
.
<EOS>
the
result
soothe
me
a
little
for
it
show
that
,
however
blindly
and
ignorantly
I
act
,
I
act
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
crying
generally
do
me
harm
;
but
it
be
not
so
<EOS>
last
night
 
I
think
it
relieve
me
.
<EOS>
I
rise
this
morning
with
a
settle
resolution
and
a
quiet
mind
.
<EOS>
nothing
Sir
Percival
can
say
or
do
shall
ever
irritate
me
again
,
or
make
me
forget
for
one
moment
that
I
be
stay
here
in
defiance
of
mortification
,
insult
,
and
threat
,
for
Laura
's
service
and
for
Laura
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
the
speculation
in
which
we
may
have
indulge
this
morning
,
on
the
subject
of
the
figure
at
the
lake
and
the
footstep
in
the
plantation
,
have
be
all
suspend
by
a
trifling
accident
which
have
cause
Laura
great
regret
.
<EOS>
She
have
lose
the
little
brooch
I
give
her
for
a
keepsake
on
the
day
before
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
as
she
wear
it
when
we
go
out
yesterday
evening
we
can
only
suppose
that
it
must
have
drop
from
her
dress
,
either
in
the
boat
-
house
or
on
our
way
back
.
<EOS>
the
servant
have
be
send
to
search
,
and
have
return
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
and
now
Laura
herself
have
go
to
look
for
it
.
<EOS>
whether
she
find
it
or
not
the
loss
will
help
to
excuse
her
absence
from
the
house
,
if
Sir
Percival
return
before
the
letter
from
Mr.
Gilmore
's
partner
be
place
in
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
one
o'clock
have
just
strike
.
<EOS>
I
be
consider
whether
I
have
better
wait
here
for
the
arrival
of
the
messenger
from
London
,
or
slip
away
quietly
,
and
watch
for
him
outside
the
lodge
gate
.
  
<EOS>
My
suspicion
of
everybody
and
everything
in
this
house
incline
me
to
think
that
the
second
plan
may
be
the
good
.
<EOS>
the
Count
be
safe
in
the
breakfast
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
hear
him
,
through
the
door
,
as
I
run
upstairs
ten
minute
since
,
exercise
his
canary
-
bird
at
their
trick
:
 
<EOS>
"

out
on
my
little
finger
,

pret

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
bird
burst
into
their
usual
ecstasy
of
singing
,
and
the
Count
chirrup
and
whistle
at
them
in
return
,
as
if
he
be
a
bird
himself
.
<EOS>
My
room
door
be
open
,
and
I
can
hear
the
shrill
singe
and
whistle
at
this
very
moment
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
really
to
slip
out
without
be
observe
,
now
be
my
time
.
  
<EOS>
four
<EOS>
O'CLOCK
.
<EOS>
the
three
hour
that
have
pass
since
I
make
my
last
entry
have
turn
the
whole
march
of
event
at
Blackwater
Park
in
a
new
direction
.
<EOS>
whether
for
good
or
for
evil
,
I
can
not
and
dare
not
decide
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
get
back
first
to
the
place
at
which
I
leave
off
,
or
I
shall
lose
myself
in
the
confusion
of
my
own
thought
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
out
,
as
I
have
propose
,
to
meet
the
messenger
with
my
letter
from
London
at
the
lodge
gate
.
<EOS>
on
the
stair
I
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
in
the
hall
I
hear
the
Count
still
exercise
his
bird
.
<EOS>
but
on
cross
the
quadrangle
outside
,
I
pass
Madame
Fosco
,
walk
by
herself
in
her
favourite
circle
,
round
and
round
the
great
fish
-
pond
.
<EOS>
I
at
once
slacken
my
pace
,
so
as
to
avoid
all
appearance
of
be
in
a
hurry
,
and
even
go
the
length
,
for
caution
's
sake
,
of
inquire
if
she
think
of
go
out
before
lunch
.
<EOS>
She
smile
at
me
in
the
friendly
manner
 
<EOS>
say
she
prefer
remain
near
the
house
,
nod
pleasantly
,
and
re
-
enter
the
hall
.
<EOS>
I
look
back
,
and
see
that
she
have
close
the
door
before
I
have
open
the
wicket
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
gate
.
  
<EOS>
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
I
reach
the
lodge
.
  
<EOS>
the
lane
outside
take
a
sudden
turn
to
the
left
,
run
on
straight
for
a
hundred
yard
or
so
,
and
then
take
another
sharp
turn
to
the
right
to
join
the
high
-
road
.
<EOS>
between
these
two
turn
,
hide
from
the
lodge
on
one
side
,
and
from
the
way
to
the
station
on
the
other
,
I
wait
,
walk
backwards
and
forwards
.
<EOS>
high
hedge
be
on
either
side
of
me
,
and
for
twenty
minute
,
by
my
watch
,
I
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
sound
of
a
carriage
catch
my
ear
,
and
I
be
meet
,
as
I
advance

DEAR
MADAM
,
 
Your
letter

this
morning
have
cause
me
very
great
anxiety

<EOS>
I
will
reply
to
it
as
briefly
and

<EOS>
"
My
careful
consideration
of
the
statement
make
by
yourself
,
and
my
knowledge
of
Lady
Glyde
's
position
,
as
define
in
the
settlement
,
lead
me
,
I
regret
to
say
,
to
the
conclusion
that
a
loan
of
the
trust
money
to
Sir
Percival
(
or
,
in
other
word
,
a
loan
of
some
portion
of
the
twenty
thousand
pound
of
Lady
Glyde
's
fortune
)
be
in
contemplation
,
and
that
she
be
make
a
party
to
the
deed
,
in
order
to
secure
her
approval
of
a
flagrant
breach
of
trust
,
and
to
have
her
signature
produce
against
her
if
she
should
complain
hereafter
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
,
on
any
other
supposition
,
to
account
,
situate
as
she
be
,
for
her
execution
to
a
deed
of
any
kind
be
want
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
event
of
Lady
Glyde
's
signing
such
a
document
,
as
I
be
compel
to
suppose
the
deed
in
question
to
be
,
her
trustee
would
be
at
liberty
to
advance
money
to
Sir
Percival
out
of
her
twenty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
if
the
amount
so
lent
should
not
be
pay
back
,
and
if
Lady
Glyde
should
have
child
,
their
fortune
will
then
be
diminish
by
the
sum
,
large
or
small
,
so
advanced
.
<EOS>
in
plainer
term
still
,
the
transaction
,
for
anything
that
Lady
Glyde
know
to
the
contrary
,
may
be
a
fraud
upon
her
unborn
child

<EOS>
"
under
these
serious
circumstance
,
I
would
recommend
Lady
Glyde
to
assign
as
a
reason
for
withhold
her
signature

that
she
wish
the
deed
to
be
first
submit
to
myself
,
as
her
family
solicitor

in
the
absence
of
my
partner

Mr.
Gilmore

<EOS>
no
reasonable
objection
can
be
make
to
take
this
course
 
for
,
if
the
transaction
be
an
honourable
one

will
necessarily
be
no

give
my
approval

very

<EOS>
It
supply
Laura
with
a
reason
for

to
the
signature

be
unanswerable

stand
before
me
as
if

spring
up
out

<EOS>
the
suddenness
of
his
appearance
,
in
the
very
last
place
under

off

<EOS>
I
take
his

the

of

scatter
sense

the

<EOS>
He
talk
on
in
this
complimentary
strain
with
a
fluency
which
leave
me
no
exertion
to
make
beyond
the
effort
of
maintain
my
composure

<EOS>
He
never
refer
in
the
most
distant
manner
to

he
have
see
in
the
lane
,
or
to
the
letter
which
I
still
have
in

<EOS>
this
ominous
discretion
help
to
convince
me
that
he
must
have
surprise
,
by
the
most
dishonourable
mean
,
the
secret
of
my
application
in
Laura

interest
to
the
lawyer
;
and
that
,
have
now
assure
himself
of
the
private
manner
in
which
I
have
receive
the
answer
,
he
have
discover
enough
to
suit
his
purpose
,
and
be
only
bent
on
try
to
quiet
the
suspicion
which
he
know
he
must
have
arouse
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
be
wise
enough
,
under
these
circumstance
,
not
to
attempt
to
deceive
him
by
plausible
explanation
,
and
woman
enough

notwithstanding
my

take

from

Count

slowly
ascend
the
step
.
<EOS>
He
honour
me
with
one
of
his
magnificent
bow
,
and
then
address
himself
gaily
to
the
scowling
master
of
the
house

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
I
linger
long
enough
in
pass
through
the
hall
-
door
to
hear
this
question
and
answer
,
and
to
see
Sir
Percival
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
in
sullen
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
want
to
badger
me

any
more

infernal
scruple

<EOS>
"
come
out
here

repeat
the
Count
,
still
perfectly
uninfluenced
by
the
rude
speech
that
his
friend
could
make
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
descend
the
step
.
<EOS>
the
Count
take
him
by
the
arm
,
and
walk
him
away
gently
.
<EOS>
the
"
business
,
"
I
be
sure
,
refer
to
the
question
of
the
signature
.
<EOS>
They
be
speak
of
Laura
and
of
me
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
feel
heart
-
sick
and
faint
with
anxiety
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
of
the
last
importance
to
both
of
us
to
know
what
they
be
say
to
each
other
at
that
moment
,
and
not
one
word
of
it
could
by
any
possibility
reach
my
ear
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
about
the
house
,
from
room
to
room
,
with
the
lawyer
's
letter
in
my
bosom
<EOS>
(
I
be
afraid
by
this
time
even
to
trust
it
under
lock
and
key
)
,
till
the
oppression
of
my
suspense
<EOS>
half
madden
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sign
of
Laura
's
return
,
and
I
think
of
go
out
to
look
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
my
strength
be
so
exhausted
by
the
trial
and
anxiety
of
the
morning
that
the
heat
of
the
day
quite
overpower
me
,
and
after
an
attempt
to
get
to
the
door
I
be
oblige
to
return
to
the
drawing
-
room
and
lie
down
on
the
near
sofa
to
recover
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
just
compose
myself
when
the
door
open
softly
and
the
Count
look
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
thousand
pardon

capricious

see
fit

business

put
off

great
relief

see
with
pleasure
in

present

good
respect
and
felicitation

mention
this
pleasant
change
of
circumstance
to
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
leave
me
before
I
have
recover
my
astonishment
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
this
extraordinary
alteration
of
purpose
in
the
matter
of
the
signature
be
due
to
his
influence
,
and
that
his
discovery
of
my
application
to
London
yesterday
,
and
of
my
have
receive
an
answer
to
it
to
-
day
,
have
offer
him
the
mean
of
interfere
with
certain
success
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
these
impression
,
but
my
mind
seem
to
share
the
exhaustion
of
my
body
,
and
I
be
in
no
condition
to
dwell
on
them
with
any
useful
reference
to
the
doubtful
present
or
the
threatening
future
.
<EOS>
I
try
a
second
time
to
run
out
and
find
Laura
,
but
my
head
be
giddy
and
my
knee
tremble
under
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
choice
but
to
give
it
up
again
and
return
to
the
sofa
,
sorely
against
my
will
.
  
<EOS>
the
quiet
in
the
house
,
and
the
low
murmuring
hum
of
summer
insect
outside
the
open
window
,
soothe
me
.
<EOS>
My
eye
close
of
themselves
,
and
I
pass
gradually
into
a
strange
condition
,
which
be
not
wake
 
for
I
know
nothing
of
what
be
go
on
about
me
,
and
not
sleep
 
for
I
be
conscious
of
my
own
repose
.
<EOS>
in
this
state
my
fevered
mind
break
loose
from
me
,
while
my
weary
body
be
at
rest
,
and
in
a
trance
,
or
day
-
dream
of
my
fancy
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
call
it
 
<EOS>
I
see
Walter
Hartright
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
think
of
him
since
I
rise
<EOS>
that
morning
 
Laura
have
not
say
one
word
to
me
either
directly
or
indirectly
refer
to
him
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
see
him
now
as
plainly
as
if
the
past
time
have
return
,
and
we
be
both
together
again
at
Limmeridge
House

<EOS>
He
appear
to
me
as
one
among
many

startle

so
dismay
by

first
wake
impression

She

She
push
me
in

lock

draw
the
chintz

a
grow
conviction
that
the
complication

to
gather
about

suddenly
close

<EOS>
I
could
not

I
could
hardly
even

it
dimly
in

for

I
go
out
,
as
you
know

to
find
my
brooch

and
I
walk
along
the
path
through
the
plantation
,
look
down
on
the
ground
carefully
at
every
step
.
<EOS>
in
that
way
I
get
on

after

house

as
soon
as
I
be
inside

I
go
on

hunt
over
the
floor

<EOS>
I
be
still
search
with
my
back
to
the
doorway

strange

behind
me

"

I
start
up
 
not
frightened

the
voice
be
too
kind
and
gentle
to
frighten
anybody

very
much
surprised
.
<EOS>
there
,
look
at
me
from
the
doorway

thin
dark
shawl

<EOS>
Her
bonnet
be
of
brown
straw

as
poor

<EOS>
I
be
strike
by
the
difference
between

the
rest

I
notice

breathless

very
strange

<EOS>
before
I
could
say
anything
to
soothe
her
,
she
hold
out
one
of
her
hand

and
I
see
my
brooch

<EOS>
I
be
so
pleased

make
it
with
such
extraordinary

I
draw
back
a
step

as
well
as
in
her
mention
my
mother
in
that
reproachful
manner

which
make
me
ashamed

I
take
her
hand
with

<EOS>
Her
face
be
pale
and
thin
and
weary
 
but
the
sight
of
it
startle
me
,
as
if

have
be
the
sight
of
my

glass
after

long
illness

the
discovery

she
break
out
violently
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
nothing
like
madness
in
her
before
this
,

I
fancy
I
see
it
now
in
her
eye

"
I
only
think
you

not
escape
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
's
eye
read
mine
attentively
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
believe
,
"
she
say
,
"
in
this
secret
that
my
husband
be
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
suppose
,
Marian
<EOS>
,
it
should
only
exist
after
all
in
Anne
Catherick
's
fancy
?
<EOS>
suppose
she
only
want
to
see
me
and
to
speak
to
me
,
for
the
sake
of
old
remembrance
?
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
so
strange
 
<EOS>
I
almost
doubt
her
.
<EOS>
Would
you
trust
her
in
other
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust
nothing
,
Laura
,
but
my
own
observation
of
your
husband
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
judge
Anne
Catherick
's
word
by
his
action
,
and
I
believe
there
be
a
secret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
no
more
,
and
get
up
to
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
thought
be
trouble
me
which
I
may
have
tell
her
if
we
have
speak
together
longer
,
and
which
it
may
have
be
dangerous
for
her
to
know
.
<EOS>
the
influence
of
the
terrible
dream
from
which
she
have
awaken
me
hang
darkly
and
heavily
over
every
fresh
impression
which
the
progress
of
her
narrative
produce
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
ominous
future
come
close
,
chill
me
with
an
unutterable
awe
,
force
on
me
the
conviction
of
an
unseen
design
in
the
long
series
of
complication
which
have
now
fasten
round
us
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
Hartright
 
as
I
see
him
in
the
body
when
he
say
farewell
;
as
I
see
him
in
the
spirit
in
my
dream
 
<EOS>
and
I
too
begin
to
doubt
now
whether
we
be
not
advance
blindfold
to
an
appoint
and
an
inevitable
end
.
  
<EOS>
leave
Laura
to
go
upstairs
alone
,
I
go
out
to
look
about
me
in
the
walk
near
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
under
which
Anne
Catherick
have
part
from
her
have
make
me
secretly
anxious
to
know
how
Count
Fosco
be
pass
the
afternoon
,
and
have
render
me
secretly
distrustful
of
the
result
of
that
solitary
journey
from
which
Sir
Percival
have
return
<EOS>
but
a
few
hour
since
.
  
<EOS>
after
look
for
them
in
every
direction
and
discover
nothing
,
I
return
to
the
house
,
and
enter
the
different
room
on
the
ground
floor
one
after
another
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
empty
.
<EOS>
I
come
out
again
into
the
hall
,
and
go
upstairs
to
return
to
Laura
.
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
open
her
door
as
I
pass
it
in
my
way
along
the
passage
,
and
I
stop
to
see
if
she
could
inform
me
of
the
whereabouts
of
her
husband
and
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
yes
,
she
have
see
them
both
from
her
window
more
than
an
hour
since
.
<EOS>
the
Count
have
look
up
with
his
customary
kindness
,
and
have
mention
with
his
habitual
attention
to
her
in
the
small
trifle
,
that
he
and
his
friend
be
go
out
together
for
a
long
walk
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
long
walk
!
<EOS>
They
have
never
yet
be
in
each
other
's
company
with
that
object
in
my
experience
of
them
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
care
for
no
exercise
but
ride
,
and
the
Count
(
except
when
he
be
polite
enough
to
be
my
escort
)
care
for
no
exercise
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
join
Laura
again
,
I
find
that
she
have
call
to
mind
in
my
absence
the
impending
question
of
the
signature
to
the
deed
,
which
,
in
the
interest
of
discuss
her
interview
with
Anne
Catherick
,
we
have
hitherto
overlook
.
<EOS>
Her
first
word
when
I
see
her
express
her
surprise
at
the
absence
of
the
expect
summon
to
attend
Sir
Percival
in
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
make
your
mind
easy
on
that
subject
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
for
the
present
,
at
least
,
neither
your
resolution
nor
mine
will
be
expose
to
any
further
trial
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
alter
his
plan
 
the
business
of
the
signature
be
put
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
put
off
?
"
<EOS>
Laura
repeat
amazedly
.
<EOS>
"
who
tell
you
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
authority
be
Count
Fosco
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
to
his
interference
that
we
be
indebted
for
your
husband
's
sudden
change
of
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
impossible
,
marian
.
<EOS>
if
the
object
of
my
signing
be
,
as
we
suppose
,
to
obtain
money
for
Sir
Percival
that
he
urgently
want
,
how
can
the
matter
be
put
off
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Laura
,
we
have
the
mean
at
hand
of
set
that
doubt
at
rest
.
<EOS>
have
you
forget
the
conversation
that
I
hear
between
Sir
Percival
and
the
lawyer
as
they
be
cross
the
hall
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
remember
 
"
  
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
alternative
propose
.
<EOS>
one
be
to
obtain
your
signature
to
the
parchment
.
<EOS>
the
other
be
to
gain
time
by
give
bill
at
three
month
.
<EOS>
the
last
resource
be
evidently
the
resource
now
adopt
,
and
we
may
fairly
hope
to
be
relieve
from
our
share
in
Sir
Percival
's
embarrassment
for
some
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Marian
,
it
sound
too
good
to
be
true
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
it
,
my
love
?
<EOS>
You
compliment
me
on
my
ready
memory
not
long
since
,
but
you
seem
to
doubt
it
now
.
<EOS>
I
will
get
my
journal
,
and
you
shall
see
if
I
be
right
or
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
go
away
and
get
the
book
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
on
look
back
to
the
entry
refer
to
the
lawyer
's
visit
,
we
find
that
my
recollection
of
the
two
alternative
present
be
accurately
correct
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
as
great
a
relief
to
my
mind
as
to
Laura
's
,
to
find
that
my
memory
have
serve
me
,
on
this
occasion
,
as
faithfully
as
usual
.
<EOS>
in
the
perilous
uncertainty
of
our
present
situation
,
it
be
hard
to
say
what
future
interest
may
not
depend
upon
the
regularity
of
the
entry
in
my
journal
,
and
upon
the
reliability
of
my
recollection
at
the
time
when
I
make
them
.
  
<EOS>
Laura
's
face
and
manner
suggest
to
me
that
this
last
consideration
have
occur
to
her
as
well
as
to
myself
.
<EOS>
anyway
,
it
be
only
a
trifling
matter
,
and
I
be
almost
ashamed
to
put
it
down
here
in
writing
 
<EOS>
it
seem
to
set
the
forlornness
of
our
situation
in
such
a
miserably
vivid
light
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
little
indeed
to
depend
on
,
when
the
discovery
that
my
memory
can
still
be
trust
to
serve
us
be
hail
as
if
it
be
the
discovery
of
a
new
friend
!
  
<EOS>
the
first
bell
for
dinner
separate
us
.
<EOS>
just
as
it
have
do
ringing
,
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
return
from
their
walk
.
<EOS>
We
hear
the
master
of
the
house
storm
at
the
servant
for
be
five
minute
late
,
and
the
master
's
guest
interpose
,
as
usual
,
in
the
interest
of
propriety
,
patience
,
and
peace
.
     
<EOS>
the
evening
have
come
and
go
.
<EOS>
no
extraordinary
event
have
happen
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
notice
certain
peculiarity
in
the
conduct
of
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
,
which
have
send
me
to
my
bed
feel
very
anxious
and
uneasy
about
Anne
Catherick
,
and
about
the
result
which
to
-
morrow
may
produce
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
enough
by
this
time
,
to
be
sure
,
that
the
aspect
of
Sir
Percival
which
be
the
most
false
,
and
which
,
therefore
,
mean
the
bad
,
be
his
polite
aspect
.
<EOS>
that
long
walk
with
his
friend
have
end
in
improve
his
manner
,
especially
towards
his
wife
.
<EOS>
to
Laura
's
secret
surprise
and
to
my
secret
alarm
,
he
call
her
by
her
christian
name
,
ask
if
she
have
hear
lately
from
her
uncle
,
inquire
when
Mrs.
Vesey
be
to
receive
her
invitation
to
Blackwater
,
and
show
her
so
many
other
little
attention
that
he
almost
recall
the
day
of
his
hateful
courtship
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
bad
sign
to
begin
with
,
and
I
think
it
more
ominous
still
that
he
should
pretend
after
dinner
to
fall
asleep
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
that
his
eye
should
cunningly
follow
Laura
and
me
when
he
think
we
neither
of
us
suspect
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
have
any
doubt
that
his
sudden
journey
by
himself
take
him
to
Welmingham
to
question
Mrs.
Catherick
 
but
the
experience
of
to
-
night
have
make
me
fear
that
the
expedition
be
not
undertake
in
vain
,
and
that
he
have
get
the
information
which
he
unquestionably
leave
us
to
collect
.
<EOS>
if
I
know
where
Anne
Catherick
be
to
be
find
,
I
would
be
up
to
-
morrow
with
sunrise
and
warn
her
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
aspect
under
which
Sir
Percival
present
himself
to
-
night
be
unhappily
but
too
familiar
to
me
,
the
aspect
under
which
the
Count
appear
be
,
on
the
other
hand
,
entirely
new
in
my
experience
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
permit
me
,
this
evening
,
to
make
his
acquaintance
,
for
the
first
time
,
in
the
character
of
a
Man
of
Sentiment
 
of
sentiment
,
as
I
believe
,
really
feel
,
not
assume
for
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
for
instance
,
he
be
quiet
and
subdue
 
his
eye
and
his
voice
express
a
restrained
sensibility
.
<EOS>
He
wear
(
as
if
there
be
some
hide
connection
between
his
showiest
finery
and
his
deep
feeling
)
<EOS>
the
most
magnificent
waistcoat
he
have
yet
appear
in
 
<EOS>
it
be
make
of
pale
sea
-
green
silk
,
and
delicately
trim
with
fine
silver
braid
.
<EOS>
His
voice
sink
into
the
tender
inflection
,
his
smile
express
a
thoughtful
,
fatherly
admiration
,
whenever
he
speak
to
Laura
or
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
press
his
wife
's
hand
under
the
table
when
she
thank
him
for
trifle
little
attention
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
take
wine
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
Your
health
and
happiness
,
my
angel
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
with
fond
glistening
eye
.
<EOS>
He
eat
little
or
nothing
,
and
sigh
,
and
say
"
Good
Percival
!
"
<EOS>
when
his
friend
laugh
at
him
.
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
he
take
Laura
by
the
hand
,
and
ask
her
if
she
would
be
"
so
sweet
as
to
play
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
She
comply
,
through
sheer
astonishment
.
<EOS>
He
sit
by
the
piano
,
with
his
watch
-
chain
resting
in
fold
,
like
a
golden
serpent
,
on
the
sea
-
green
protuberance
of
his
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
His
immense
head
lie
languidly
on
one
side
,
and
he
gently
beat
time
with
two
of
his
yellow
-
white
finger
.
<EOS>
He
highly
approve
of
the
music
,
and
tenderly
admire
Laura
's
manner
of
play
 
not
as
poor
Hartright
use
to
praise
it
,
with
an
innocent
enjoyment
of
the
sweet
sound
,
but
with
a
clear
,
cultivated
,
practical
knowledge
of
the
merit
of
the
composition
,
in
the
first
place
,
and
of
the
merit
of
the
player
's
touch
in
the
second
.
<EOS>
as
the
evening
close
in
,
he
beg
that
the
lovely
die
light
may
not
be
profane
,
just
yet
,
by
the
appearance
of
the
lamp
.
<EOS>
He
come
,
with
his
horribly
silent
tread
,
to
the
distant
window
at
which
I
be
stand
,
to
be
out
of
his
way
and
to
avoid
the
very
sight
of
him
 
<EOS>
he
come
to
ask
me
to
support
his
protest
against
the
lamp
.
<EOS>
if
any
one
of
them
could
only
have
burn
him
up
at
that
moment
,
I
would
have
go
down
to
the
kitchen
and
fetch
it
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
surely
you
like
this
modest
,
tremble
english
twilight
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
softly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
I
love
it
.
<EOS>
I
feel
my
inborn
admiration
of
all
that
be
noble
,
and
great
,
and
good
,
purify
by
the
breath
of
heaven
on
an
evening
like
this
.
<EOS>
nature
have
such
imperishable
charm
,
such
inextinguishable
tenderness
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
an
old
,
fat
man
 
talk
which
would
become
your
lip
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
sound
like
a
derision
and
a
mockery
on
mine
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
to
be
laugh
at
in
my
moment
of
sentiment
,
as
if
my
soul
be
like
myself
,
old
and
overgrown
.
<EOS>
observe
,
dear
lady
,
what
a
light
be
die
on
the
tree
!
<EOS>
do
it
penetrate
your
heart
,
as
it
penetrate
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
,
look
at
me
,
and
repeat
the
famous
line
of
Dante
on
the
evening
-
time
,
with
a
melody
and
tenderness
which
add
a
charm
of
their
own
to
the
matchless
beauty
of
the
poetry
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
suddenly
,
as
the
last
cadence
of
those
noble
italian
word
die
away
on
his
lip
;
"
I
make
an
old
fool
of
myself
,
and
only
weary
you
all
!
<EOS>
let
us
shut
up
the
window
in
our
bosom
and
get
back
to
the
matter
-
of
-
fact
world
.
<EOS>
Percival
!
<EOS>
I
sanction
the
admission
of
the
lamp
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
 
Miss
Halcombe
 
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
my
good
wife
 
which
of
you
will
indulge
me
with
a
game
at
domino
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
address
us
all
,
but
he
look
especially
at
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
learn
to
feel
my
dread
of
offend
him
,
and
she
accept
his
proposal
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
I
could
have
do
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
sit
down
at
the
same
table
with
him
for
any
consideration
.
<EOS>
His
eye
seem
to
reach
my
inmost
soul
through
the
thicken
obscurity
of
the
twilight
.
<EOS>
His
voice
tremble
along
every
nerve
in
my
body
,
and
turn
me
hot
and
cold
alternately
.
<EOS>
the
mystery
and
terror
of
my
dream
,
which
have
haunt
me
at
interval
all
through
the
evening
,
now
oppress
my
mind
with
an
unendurable
foreboding
and
an
unutterable
awe
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
white
tomb
again
,
and
the
veiled
woman
rise
out
of
it
by
Hartright
's
side
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
Laura
well
up
like
a
spring
in
the
depth
of
my
heart
,
and
fill
it
with
water
of
bitterness
,
never
,
never
know
to
it
before
.
<EOS>
I
catch
her
by
the
hand
as
she
pass
me
on
her
way
to
the
table
,
and
kiss
her
as
if
that
night
be
to
part
us
for
ever
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
all
gaze
at
me
in
astonishment
,
I
run
out
through
the
low
window
which
be
open
before
me
to
the
ground
 
run
out
to
hide
from
them
in
the
darkness
,
to
hide
even
from
myself
.
  
<EOS>
We
separate
that
evening
later
than
usual
.
<EOS>
towards
midnight
the
summer
silence
be
break
by
the
shuddering
of
a
low
,
melancholy
wind
among
the
tree
.
<EOS>
We
all
feel
the
sudden
chill
in
the
atmosphere
,
but
the
Count
be
the
first
to
notice
the
stealthy
rise
of
the
wind
.
<EOS>
He
stop
while
he
be
light
my
candle
for
me
,
and
hold
up
his
hand
warningly
    
"
listen
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
there
will
be
a
change
to
-
morrow
.
"
    
<EOS>
June
19th
.
 
<EOS>
the
event
of
yesterday
warn
me
to
be
ready
,
sooner
or
later
,
to
meet
the
bad
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
be
not
yet
at
an
end
,
and
the
bad
have
come
.
  
<EOS>
judge
by
the
close
calculation
of
time
that
Laura
and
I
could
make
,
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
Anne
Catherick
must
have
appear
at
the
boat
-
house
at
half
-
past
two
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
of
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
arrange
that
Laura
should
just
show
herself
at
the
luncheon
-
table
to
-
day
,
and
should
then
slip
out
at
the
first
opportunity
,
leave
me
behind
to
preserve
appearance
,
and
to
follow
her
as
soon
as
I
could
safely
do
so
.
<EOS>
this
mode
of
proceeding
,
if
no
obstacle
occur
to
thwart
us
,
would
enable
her
to
be
at
the
boat
-
house
before
half
-
past
two
,
and
(
when
I
leave
the
table
,
in
my
turn
)
would
take
me
to
a
safe
position
in
the
plantation
before
three
.
  
<EOS>
the
change
in
the
weather
,
which
last
night
's
wind
warn
us
to
expect
,
come
with
the
morning
.
<EOS>
It
be
rain
heavily
when
I
get
up
,
and
it
continue
to
rain
until
twelve
o'clock
 
when
the
cloud
disperse
,
the
blue
sky
appear
,
and
the
sun
shine
again
with
the
bright
promise
of
a
fine
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
My
anxiety
to
know
how
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
would
occupy
the
early
part
of
the
day
be
by
no
means
set
at
rest
,
so
far
as
Sir
Percival
be
concern
,
by
his
leave
us
immediately
after
breakfast
,
and
go
out
by
himself
,
in
spite
of
the
rain
.
<EOS>
He
neither
tell
us
where
he
be
go
nor
when
we
may
expect
him
back
.
<EOS>
We
see
him
pass
the
breakfast
-
room
window
hastily
,
with
his
high
boot
and
his
waterproof
coat
on
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
Count
pass
the
morning
quietly
indoor
,
some
part
of
it
in
the
library
,
some
part
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
play
odd
and
end
of
music
on
the
piano
,
and
hum
to
himself
.
<EOS>
judge
by
appearance
,
the
sentimental
side
of
his
character
be
persistently
inclined
to
betray
itself
still
.
<EOS>
He
be
silent
and
sensitive
,
and
ready
to
sigh
and
languish
ponderously
(
as
only
fat
man
CAN
sigh
and
languish
)
on
the
small
provocation
.
  
<EOS>
luncheon
-
time
come
and
Sir
Percival
do
not
return
.
<EOS>
the
Count
take
his
friend
's
place
at
the
table
,
plaintively
devour
the
great
part
of
a
fruit
tart
,
submerge
under
a
whole
jugful
of
cream
,
and
explain
the
full
merit
of
the
achievement
to
us
as
soon
as
he
have
do
.
"
<EOS>
a
taste
for
sweet
,
"
he
say
in
his
soft
tone
and
his
tender
manner
,
"
be
the
innocent
taste
of
woman
and
child
.
<EOS>
I
love
to
share
it
with
them
 
<EOS>
it
be
another
bond
,
dear
lady
,
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
leave
the
table
in
ten
minute
'
time
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorely
tempt
to
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
but
if
we
have
both
go
out
together
we
must
have
excite
suspicion
,
and
bad
still
,
if
we
allow
Anne
Catherick
to
see
Laura
,
accompany
by
a
second
person
who
be
a
stranger
to
her
,
we
should
in
all
probability
forfeit
her
confidence
from
that
moment
,
never
to
regain
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
wait
,
therefore
,
as
patiently
as
I
could
,
until
the
servant
come
in
to
clear
the
table
.
<EOS>
when
I
quit
the
room
,
there
be
no
sign
,
in
the
house
or
out
of
it
,
of
Sir
Percival
's
return
.
<EOS>
I
leave
the
Count
with
a
piece
of
sugar
between
his
lip
,
and
the
vicious
cockatoo
scramble
up
his
waistcoat
to
get
at
it
,
while
Madame
Fosco
,
sit
opposite
to
her
husband
,
watch
the
proceeding
of
his
bird
and
himself
as
attentively
as
if
she
have
never
see
anything
of
the
sort
before
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
on
my
way
to
the
plantation
I
keep
carefully
beyond
the
range
of
view
from
the
luncheon
-
room
window
.
<EOS>
nobody
see
me
and
nobody
follow
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
a
quarter
to
three
o'clock
by
my
watch
.
  
<EOS>
once
among
the
tree
I
walk
rapidly
,
until
I
have
advance
more
than
half
-
way
through
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
at
that
point
I
slacken
my
pace
and
proceed
cautiously
,
but
I
see
no
one
,
and
hear
no
voice
.
<EOS>
by
little
and
little
I
come
within
view
of
the
back
of
the
boat
-
house
 
stop
and
listen
 
then
go
on
,
till
I
be
close
behind
it
,
and
must
have
hear
any
person
who
be
talk
inside
.
<EOS>
still
the
silence
be
unbroken
 
still
far
and
near
no
sign
of
a
live
creature
appear
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
after
skirt
round
by
the
back
of
the
building
,
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
,
and
make
no
discovery
,
I
venture
in
front
of
it
,
and
fairly
look
in
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
empty
.
  
<EOS>
I
call
,
"
Laura
!
"
 
<EOS>
at
first
softly
,
then
louder
and
louder
.
<EOS>
no
one
answer
and
no
one
appear
.
<EOS>
for
all
that
I
could
see
and
hear
,
the
only
human
creature
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
lake
and
the
plantation
be
myself
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
begin
to
beat
violently
,
but
I
keep
my
resolution
,
and
search
,
first
the
boat
-
house
and
then
the
ground
in
front
of
it
,
for
any
sign
which
may
show
me
whether
Laura
have
really
reach
the
place
or
not
.
<EOS>
no
mark
of
her
presence
appear
inside
the
building
,
but
I
find
trace
of
her
outside
it
,
in
footstep
on
the
sand
.
  
<EOS>
I
detect
the
footstep
of
two
person
 
large
footstep
like
a
man
's
,
and
small
footstep
,
which
,
by
put
my
own
foot
into
them
and
test
their
size
in
that
manner
,
I
feel
certain
be
Laura
's
.
<EOS>
the
ground
be
confusedly
mark
in
this
way
just
before
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
close
against
one
side
of
it
,
under
shelter
of
the
projecting
roof
,
I
discover
a
little
hole
in
the
sand
 
<EOS>
a
hole
artificially
make
,
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
just
notice
it
,
and
then
turn
away
immediately
to
trace
the
footstep
as
far
as
I
could
,
and
to
follow
the
direction
in
which
they
may
lead
me
.
  
<EOS>
They
lead
me
,
start
from
the
left
-
hand
side
of
the
boat
-
house
,
along
the
edge
of
the
tree
,
a
distance
<EOS>
,
I
should
think
,
of
between
two
and
three
hundred
yard
,
and
then
the
sandy
ground
show
no
further
trace
of
them
.
<EOS>
feel
that
the
person
whose
course
I
be
track
must
necessarily
have
enter
the
plantation
at
this
point
,
I
enter
it
too
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
could
find
no
path
,
but
I
discover
one
afterwards
,
just
faintly
trace
among
the
tree
,
and
follow
it
.
<EOS>
It
take
me
,
for
some
distance
,
in
the
direction
of
the
village
,
until
I
stop
at
a
point
where
another
foot
-
track
cross
it
.
<EOS>
the
bramble
grow
thickly
on
either
side
of
this
second
path
.
<EOS>
I
stand
look
down
it
,
uncertain
which
way
to
take
next
,
and
while
I
look
I
see
on
one
thorny
branch
some
fragment
of
fringe
from
a
woman
's
shawl
.
<EOS>
a
close
examination
of
the
fringe
satisfy
me
that
it
have
be
tear
from
a
shawl
of
Laura
's
,
and
I
instantly
follow
the
second
path
.
<EOS>
It
bring
me
out
at
last
,
to
my
great
relief
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
say
to
my
great
relief
,
because
I
infer
that
Laura
must
,
for
some
unknown
reason
,
have
return
before
me
by
this
roundabout
way
.
<EOS>
I
go
in
by
the
court
-
yard
and
the
office
.
<EOS>
the
first
person
whom
I
meet
in
cross
the
servant
'
hall
be
Mrs.
Michelson
,
the
housekeeper
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
"
I
ask
,
"
whether
Lady
Glyde
have
come
in
from
her
walk
or
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lady
come
in
a
little
while
ago
with
Sir
Percival
,
"
answer
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
something
very
distressing
have
happen
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
heart
sink
within
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
an
accident
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
 
thank
God
,
no
accident
.
<EOS>
but
my
lady
run
upstairs
to
her
own
room
in
tear
,
and
Sir
Percival
have
order
me
to
give
Fanny
warning
to
leave
in
an
hour
's
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
Laura
's
maid
 
<EOS>
a
good
affectionate
girl
who
have
be
with
her
for
year
 
<EOS>
the
only
person
in
the
house
whose
fidelity
and
devotion
we
could
both
depend
upon
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
Fanny
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
my
room
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
the
young
woman
be
quite
overcome
,
and
I
tell
her
to
sit
down
and
try
to
recover
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
Mrs.
Michelson
's
room
,
and
find
Fanny
in
a
corner
,
with
her
box
by
her
side
,
cry
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
give
me
no
explanation
whatever
of
her
sudden
dismissal
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
order
that
she
should
have
a
month
's
wage
,
in
place
of
a
month
's
warning
,
and
go
.
<EOS>
no
reason
have
be
assign
 
no
objection
have
be
make
to
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
forbid
to
appeal
to
her
mistress
,
forbid
even
to
see
her
for
a
moment
to
say
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
go
without
explanation
or
farewell
,
and
to
go
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
after
soothe
the
poor
girl
by
a
few
friendly
word
,
I
ask
where
she
propose
to
sleep
that
night
.
<EOS>
She
reply
that
she
think
of
go
to
the
little
inn
in
the
village
,
the
landlady
of
which
be
a
respectable
woman
,
know
to
the
servant
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
by
leave
early
,
she
may
get
back
to
her
friend
in
Cumberland
without
stop
in
London
,
where
she
be
a
total
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
directly
that
Fanny
's
departure
offer
us
a
safe
mean
of
communication
with
London
and
with
Limmeridge
House
,
of
which
it
may
be
very
important
to
avail
ourselves
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
tell
her
that
she
may
expect
to
hear
from
her
mistress
or
from
me
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
and
that
she
may
depend
on
our
both
do
all
that
lie
in
our
power
to
help
her
,
under
the
trial
of
leave
us
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
those
word
say
,
I
shake
hand
with
her
and
go
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
which
lead
to
Laura
's
room
be
the
door
of
an
ante
-
chamber
opening
on
to
the
passage
.
<EOS>
when
I
try
it
,
it
be
bolt
on
the
inside
.
  
<EOS>
I
knock
,
and
the
door
be
open
by
the
same
heavy
,
overgrow
housemaid
whose
lumpish
insensibility
have
try
my
patience
so
severely
on
the
day
when
I
find
the
wounded
dog
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
since
that
time
,
discover
that
her
name
be
Margaret
Porcher
,
and
that
she
be
the
most
awkward
,
slatternly
,
and
obstinate
servant
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
on
open
the
door
she
instantly
step
out
to
the
threshold
,
and
stand
grin
at
me
in
stolid
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
stand
there
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
see
that
I
want
to
come
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
but
you
must
not
come
in
,
"
be
the
answer
,
with
another
and
a
broad
grin
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
talk
to
me
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
stand
back
instantly
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
stretch
out
a
great
red
hand
and
arm
on
each
side
of
her
,
so
as
to
bar
the
doorway
,
and
slowly
nod
her
addle
head
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
's
order
,
"
she
say
,
and
nod
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
need
of
all
my
self
-
control
to
warn
me
against
contest
the
matter
with
HER
,
and
to
remind
me
that
the
next
word
I
have
to
say
must
be
address
to
her
master
.
<EOS>
I
turn
my
back
on
her
,
and
instantly
go
downstairs
to
find
him
.
<EOS>
My
resolution
to
keep
my
temper
under
all
the
irritation
that
Sir
Percival
could
offer
be
,
by
this
time
,
as
completely
forget
 
<EOS>
I
say
so
to
my
shame
 
as
if
I
have
never
make
it
.
<EOS>
It
do
me
good
,
after
all
I
have
suffer
and
suppress
in
that
house
 
<EOS>
it
actually
do
me
good
to
feel
how
angry
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
drawing
-
room
and
the
breakfast
-
room
be
both
empty
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
to
the
library
,
and
there
I
find
Sir
Percival
,
the
Count
,
and
Madame
Fosco
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
three
stand
up
,
close
together
,
and

the

to

the
drawing
-
room
,
as
compare
with
the
time
at
which
Laura
and
Anne
Catherick
have
be
speak
together
,
prove
that
fact
to
us
at
any
rate
,
beyond
a
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
have
arrive
at
something
like
a
conclusion
so
far
,
my
next
great
interest
be
to
know
what
discovery
Sir
Percival
have
make
after
Count
Fosco
have
give
him
his
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
come
you
to
lose
possession
of
the
letter
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
do
with
it
when
you
find
it
in
the
sand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
after
read
it
once
through
,
"
she
reply
,
"
I
take
it
into
the
boat
-
house
with
me
to
sit
down
and
look
over
it
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
read
a
shadow
fall
across
the
paper
.
<EOS>
I
look
up
,
and
see
Sir
Percival
stand
in
the
doorway
watch
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
try
to
hide
the
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
try
,
but
he
stop
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
trouble
to
hide
that
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
happen
to
have
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
only
look
at
him
helplessly
 
I
could
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
You
understand
?
<EOS>
"
he
go
on
;
"
I
have
read
it
.
<EOS>
I
dig
it
up
out
of
the
sand
two
hour
since
,
and
bury
it
again
,
and
write
the
word
above
it
again
,
and
leave
it
ready
to
your
hand
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
lie
yourself
out
of
the
scrape
now
.
<EOS>
You
see
Anne
Catherick
in
secret
yesterday
,
and
you
have
get
her
letter
in
your
hand
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
catch
HER
yet
,
but
I
have
catch
you
.
<EOS>
give
me
the
letter
.
"
<EOS>
He
step
close
up
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
be
alone
with
him
,
Marian
 
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
say
when
you
give
it
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
first
he
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
take
me
by
the
arm
,
and
lead
me
out
of
the
boat
-
house
,
and
look
about
him
on
all
side
,
as
if
he
be
afraid
of
our
be
see
or
hear

<EOS>
then
he
clasp
his
hand
fast
round
my
arm
,
and
whisper
to
me
,
<EOS>
"
what

it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
it
,
Laura
,
because
our
endurance
must
end
,
and
our
resistance
must
begin
to
-
day

<EOS>
that
mark
be
a
weapon
to
strike
him
with

see
it

I
may
have
to

She

me
the
mark

<EOS>
I
be
past
grieve
over
them

past
cry
over
them

past
shudder
over
them

<EOS>
They
say
we
be
either
well
than
man
,
or
bad

<EOS>
if
the
temptation
that
have
fall
in
some
woman

way

and
make
them
bad

have
fall
in
mine
at
that
moment

God

<EOS>
my
face
betray
nothing
that
his
wife
could
read

<EOS>
the
gentle

innocent

affectionate
creature
think
I
be
frightened
for
her

sorry
for
her

no

anything

He
look
at
me
,
and
laugh
to
himself
in
a
mocking

bitter
way

<EOS>
He
lead
me
away
by
a
strange
path
through
the
plantation
 
a
path
where
there
be
no
hope
of
our
meeting
you
 
<EOS>
and
he
speak
no
more
till
we
come
within
sight
of
the
house

<EOS>
then
he
stop
again
,
and
say
,
"
Will
you
take
a

I
could
only
repeat
the
same
word
I
have
speak
before
.
<EOS>
He
curse
my
obstinacy
,
and
go
on
,
and
take
me
with
him
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
deceive
me

he
say
,
"
you
know
more

have
your

out

it
out

I
will
have
you
watch
morning

noon

and
night
,
till
you
confess
the
truth

<EOS>
"
He
be
deaf
to
everything
I
could
say
.
<EOS>
He
take
me
straight
upstairs
into
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
sit
there
,
do
some
work
for
me
,
and
he
instantly
order
her
out

I

take
good

conspiracy

<EOS>
He
push
me
into
the
room
,
and
lock
the
door
on
me
.
<EOS>
He
set
that
senseless
woman
to
watch
me
outside
,
Marian
!

He
look
and
speak
like
a
madman

You
may
hardly
understand
it
 
he
do
indeed

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
understand
it
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
be
mad
 
mad
with
the
terror
of
a
guilty
conscience
.
<EOS>
every
word
you
have
say
make
me
positively
certain
that
when
Anne
Catherick
leave
you
yesterday
you
be
on
the
eve
of
discover
a
secret
which
may
have
be
your
vile
husband
's
ruin
,
and
he
think
you
have
discover
it
.
<EOS>
nothing
you
can
say
or
do
will
quiet
that
guilty
distrust
,
and
convince
his
false
nature
of
your
truth
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
this
,
my
love
,
to
alarm
you
.
<EOS>
I
say
it
to
open
your
eye
to
your
position
,
and
to
convince
you
of
the
urgent
necessity
of
let
me
act
,
as
I
best
can
,
for
your
protection
while
the
chance
be
our
own
.
<EOS>
Count
Fosco
's
interference
have
secure
me
access
to
you
to
-
day
,
but
he
may
withdraw
that
interference
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
already
dismiss
Fanny
because
she
be
a
quick
-
witted
girl
,
and
devotedly
attach
to
you
,
and
have
choose
a
woman
to
take
her
place
who
care
nothing
for
your
interest
,
and
whose
dull
intelligence
lower
her
to
the
level
of
the
watch
-
dog
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
say
what
violent
measure
he
may
take
next
,
unless
we
make
the
most
of
our
opportunity
while
we
have
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
we
do
,
Marian
?
<EOS>
oh
,
if
we
could
only
leave
this
house
,
never
to
see
it
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
listen
to
me
,
my
love
,
and
try
to
think
that
you
be
not
quite
helpless
so
long
as
I
be
here
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
think
<EOS>
so
 
I
do
think
so

<EOS>
do
not
altogether
forget
poor
Fanny
in
thinking
of
me
.
<EOS>
She
want
help
and
comfort
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
forget
her
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
before
I
come
up
here
,

I
have
arrange
to
communicate
with
her
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
letter
be
not
safe
in
the
post
-
bag
at
Blackwater
Park
,
and
I
shall
have
two
to
write
to
-
day
,
in
your
interest
,
which
must
pass
through
no
hand
but
Fanny
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
write
first
,
Laura
,
to
Mr.
Gilmore
's
partner
,
who
have
offer
to
help
us
in
any
fresh
emergency
.
<EOS>
little
as
I
know
of
the
law
,
I
be
certain
that
it
can
protect
a
woman
from
such
treatment
as
that
ruffian
have
inflict
on
you
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
into
no
detail
about
Anne
Catherick
,
because
I
have
no
certain
information
to
give
.
<EOS>
but
the
lawyer
shall
know
of
those
bruise
on
your
arm
,
and
of
the
violence
offer
to
you
in
this
room
 
he
shall
,
before
I
rest
to
-
night

<EOS>
"
but
think
of
the
exposure
,
Marian
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
calculate
on
the
exposure
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
more
to
dread
from
it
than
you
have
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
an
exposure
may
bring
him
to
term
when
nothing
else
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rise
as
I
speak
,
but
Laura
entreat
me
not
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
drive
him
to
desperation
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
increase
our
danger
tenfold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
feel
the
truth
 
the
dishearten
truth
 
of
those
word
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
bring
myself
plainly
to
acknowledge
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
in
our
dreadful
position
there
be
no
help
and
no
hope
for
us
but
in
risk
the
bad
.
<EOS>
I
say
so
in
guard
term
.
<EOS>
She
sigh
bitterly
,
but
do
not
contest
the
matter
.
<EOS>
She
only
ask
about
the
second
letter
that
I
have
propose
writing
.
<EOS>
to
whom
be
it
to
be
address
?
  
<EOS>
"
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
be
your
near
male
relative
,
and
the
head
of
the
family

<EOS>
He
must
and
shall
interfere
.
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
shake
her
head
sorrowfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
I
go
on
,
"
your
uncle
be
a
weak
,
selfish
,
worldly
man
,
I
know
,
but
he
be
not
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
and
he
have
no
such
friend
about
him
as
Count
Fosco
.
<EOS>
I
expect
nothing
from
his
kindness
or
his
tenderness
of
feeling
towards
you
or
towards
me
,
but
he
will
do
anything
to
pamper
his
own
indolence
,
and
to
secure
his
own
quiet
.
<EOS>
let
me
only
persuade
him
that
his
interference
at
this
moment
will
save
him
inevitable
trouble
and
wretchedness
and
responsibility
hereafter
,
and
he
will
bestir
himself
for
his
own
sake
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
to
deal
with
him
,
Laura
 
I
have
have
some
practice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
could
only
prevail
on
him
to
let
me
go
back
to
Limmeridge
for
a
little
while
and
stay
there
quietly
with
you
,
Marian
<EOS>
,
I
could
be
almost
as
happy
again
as
I
be
before
I
be
married
!
"
  
<EOS>
those
word
set
me
think
in
a
new
direction
.
<EOS>
Would
it
be
possible
to
place
Sir
Percival
between
the
two
alternative
of
either
expose
himself
to
the
scandal
of
legal
interference
on
his
wife
's
behalf
,
or
of
allow
her
to
be
quietly
separate
from
him
for
a
time
under
pretext
of
a
visit
to
her
uncle
's
house
?
<EOS>
and
could
he
,
in
that
case
,
be
reckon
on
as
likely
to
accept
the
last
resource
?
<EOS>
It
be
doubtful
 
more
than
doubtful
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
hopeless
as
the
experiment
seem
,
surely
it
be
worth
try
.
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
try
it
in
sheer
despair
of
know
what
well
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
shall
know
the
wish
you
have
just
express
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
I
will
ask
the
lawyer
's
advice
on
the
subject
as
well
.
<EOS>
good
may
come
of
it
 
and
will
come
of
it
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
say
that
I
rise
again
,
and
again
Laura
try
to
make
me
resume
my
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
leave
me
,
"
she
say
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"
My
desk
be
on
that
table
.
<EOS>
You
can
write
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
try
me
to
the
quick
to
refuse
her
,
even
in
her
own
interest
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
be
too
long
shut
up
alone
together
already
.
<EOS>
Our
chance
of
see
each
other
again
may
entirely
depend
on
our
not
excite
any
fresh
suspicion
.
<EOS>
It
be
full
time
to
show
myself
,
quietly
and
unconcernedly
,
among
the
wretch
who
be
at
that
very
moment
,
perhaps
,
think
of
us
and
talk
of
us
downstairs
.
<EOS>
I
explain
the
miserable
necessity
to
Laura
,
and
prevail
on
her
to
recognise
it
as

I

It

a
relief
to
me
as
I
walk
away

turn
in

to
know
that
the

<EOS>
June
19th
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
get
as
far
as
the
top
of
the
stair
when
the
locking
of
Laura
's
door
suggest
to
me
the
precaution
of
also
lock
my
own
door
,
and
keep
the
key
safely
about
me
while
I
be
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
My
journal
be
already
secure
with
other
paper
in
the
table
drawer
,
but
my
writing
material
be
leave
out
.
<EOS>
these
include
a
seal
bear
the
common
device
of
two
dove
drink
out
of
the
same
cup
,
and
some
sheet
of
blotting
-
paper
,
which
have
the
impression
on
them
of
the
closing
line
of
my
writing
in
these
page
trace
during
the
past
night
.
<EOS>
distort
by
the
suspicion
which
have
now
become
a
part
of
myself
,
even
such
trifle
as
these
look
too
dangerous
to
be
trust
without
a
guard
 
even
the
lock
table
drawer
seem
to
be
not
sufficiently
protect
in
my
absence
until
the
mean
of
access
to
it
have
be
carefully
secure
as
well
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
no
appearance
of
any
one
have
enter
the
room
while
I
have
be
talk
with
Laura
.
<EOS>
My
writing
material
(
which
I
have
give
the
servant
instruction
never
to
meddle
with
)
be
scatter
over
the
table
much
as
usual
.
<EOS>
the
only
circumstance
in
connection
with
them
that
at
all
strike
me
be
that
the
seal
lie
tidily
in
the
tray
with
the
pencil
and
the
wax
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
my
careless
habit
(
I
be
sorry
to
say
)
to
put
it
there
,
neither
do
I
remember
put
it
there
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
could
not
call
to
mind
,
on
the
other
hand
,
where
else
I
have
throw
it
down
,
and
as
I
be
also
doubtful
whether
I
may
not
for
once
have
lay
it
mechanically
in
the
right
place
,
I
abstain
from
add
to
the
perplexity
with
which
the
day
's
event
have
fill
my
mind
by
trouble
it
afresh
about
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
I
lock
the
door
,
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
,
and
go
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
be
alone
in
the
hall
look
at
the
weather
-
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
still
fall
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
we
must
expect
more
rain
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
face
be
compose
again
to
its
customary
expression
and
its
customary
colour
.
<EOS>
but
the
hand
with
which
she
point
to
the
dial
of
the
weather
-
glass
still
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
Could
she
have
tell
her
husband
already
that
she
have
overhear
Laura
revile
him
,
in
my
company
,
as
a
"
spy
?
"
<EOS>
My
strong
suspicion
that
she
must
have
tell
him
,
my
irresistible
dread
(
all
the
more
overpowering
from
its
very
vagueness
)
of
the
consequence
which
may
follow
,
my
fix
conviction
,
derive
from
various
little
self
-
betrayal
which
woman
notice
in
each
other
,
that
Madame
Fosco
,
in
spite
of
her
well
-
assume
external
civility
,
have
not
forgive
her
niece
for
innocently
stand
between
her
and
the
legacy
of
ten
thousand
pound
 
all
rush
upon
my
mind
together
,
all
impel
me
to
speak
in
the
vain
hope
of
use
my
own
influence
and
my
own
power
of
persuasion
for
the
atonement
of
Laura
's
offence
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
trust
to
your
kindness
to
excuse
me
,
Madame
Fosco
,
if
I
venture
to
speak
to
you
on
an
exceedingly
painful
subject
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
cross
her
hand
in
front
of
her
and
bow
her
head
solemnly
,
without
utter
a
word
,
and
without
take
her
eye
off
mine
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
be
so
good
as
to
bring
me
back
my
handkerchief
,
"
I
go
on
,
"
I
be
very
,
very
much
afraid
you
must
have
accidentally
hear
Laura
say
something
which
I
be
unwilling
to
repeat
,
and
which
I
will
not
attempt
to
defend
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
venture
to
hope
that
you
have
not
think
it
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
mention
to
the
Count
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
of
no
importance
whatever

say
Madame
Fosco
sharply
and
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
she
add
,
resume
her
icy
manner
in
a
moment
,
"
I
have
no
secret
from
my
husband
even
in
trifle

<EOS>
when
he
notice
just
now
that
I
look
distressed
,
it
be
my
painful
duty
to
tell
him
why
I
be
distressed

I
frankly
acknowledge
to
you
,
Miss
Halcombe

that
I

<EOS>
I
be

she
turn
me
cold
all
over

<EOS>
"

the
sad
position

<EOS>
She
speak
while
she
be
smart
under
the
insult

injustice
inflict
on
her
by
her
husband

she
be
not

will
be
considerately

<EOS>
"
most
assuredly

the
Count
's
quiet
voice
behind
me

<EOS>
He
have
steal
on
us
with
his
noiseless
tread
and
his
book
in
his
hand
from
the

when

hasty
word

she
do
me
an
injustice

I
lament

<EOS>
let

never

all
comfortably
combine

forget
it
from

<EOS>
"
You

very
kind

I
say
,
"
you
relieve
me
inexpressibly

I
try
to
continue

but
his
eye
be
on
me
;
his
deadly
smile

hide
everything
be
set

hard

and
unwavere
on
his
broad

smooth

<EOS>
My
distrust

his
unfathomable
falseness
,
my
sense
of
my
own
degradation
in
stoop
to
conciliate
his

so
disturbed

confuse
me

I

there
in
silence

you

so
much

<EOS>
with
that
polite
speech
he
take
my
hand
 
<EOS>
oh
,
how
I
despise
myself
!
<EOS>
oh
,
how
little
comfort
there
be
even
in
know
that
I
submit
to
it
for
Laura

sake

<EOS>
he
take
my
hand
and
put
it
to
his
poisonous
lip

<EOS>
never

I
know
all
my
horror
of
him

then

that
innocent
familiarity
turn
my

it

vile
insult

I
hide
my
disgust

him
 
<EOS>
I
try

smile
 
I

who
once
mercilessly
despise
deceit
in
other
woman

be
as
false
as
the
bad
of
them

as
false
as
the
Judas
whose
lip
have
touch
my

<EOS>
I
could
not

maintain
my
degrade
self

control
 
<EOS>
it
be
all
that
redeem
me
in
my
own
estimation
to
know
that
I
could
not
 
if
he
have
still
continue
to
keep
his
eye
on
my
face

<EOS>
His

's
tigerish
jealousy
come
to
my
rescue

force
his
attention
away
from
me
the
moment
he
possess
himself

<EOS>
Her
cold
blue
eye
catch
light

cheek
flush
into
bright
colour

she
look
year
young

<EOS>
"

Your

"
with
those
word
he
drop
my
hand
and
quietly
raise
his
wife
's
hand
to
his
lip
in
place
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
run
back
up
the
stair
to
take
refuge
in
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
if
there
have
be
time
to
think
,
my
thought
,
when
I
be
alone
again
,
would
have
cause
me
bitter
suffering
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
time
to
think
.
<EOS>
happily
for
the
preservation
of
my
calmness
and
my
courage
there
be
time
for
nothing
but
action
.
  
<EOS>
the
letter
to
the
lawyer
and
to
Mr.
Fairlie
be
still
to
be
write
,
and
I
sit
down
at
once
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
to
devote
myself
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
multitude
of
resource
to
perplex
me
 
there
be
absolutely
no
one
to
depend
on
,
in
the
first
instance
,
but
myself
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
neither
friend
nor
relative
in
the
neighbourhood
whose
intercession
I
could
attempt
to
employ
.
<EOS>
He
be
on
the
cold
term
 
in
some
case
on
the
bad
term
with
the
family
of
his
own
rank
and
station
who
live
near
him
.
<EOS>
We
two
woman
have
neither
father
nor
brother
to
come
to
the
house
and
take
our
part
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
choice
but
to
write
those
two
doubtful
letter
,
or
to
put
Laura
in
the
wrong
and
myself
in
the
wrong
,
and
to
make
all
peaceable
negotiation
in
the
future
impossible
by
secretly
escape
from
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
most
imminent
personal
peril
could
justify
our
take
that
second
course
.
<EOS>
the
letter
must
be
try
first
,
and
I
write
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
to
the
lawyer
about
Anne
Catherick
,
because
(
as
I
have
already
hint
to
Laura
)
<EOS>
that
topic
be
connect
with
a
mystery
which
we
could
not
yet
explain
,
and
which
it
would
therefore
be
useless
to
write
about
to
a
professional
man
.
<EOS>
I
leave
my
correspondent
to
attribute
Sir
Percival
's
disgraceful
conduct
,
if
he
please
,
to
fresh
dispute
about
money
matter
,
and
simply
consult
him
on
the
possibility
of
take
legal
proceeding
for
Laura
's
protection
in
the
event
of
her
husband
's
refusal
to
allow
her
to
leave
Blackwater
Park
for
a
time
and
return
with
me
to
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
I
refer
him
to
Mr.
Fairlie
for
the
detail
of
this
last
arrangement
 
<EOS>
I
assure
him
that
I
write
with
Laura
's
authority
 
<EOS>
and
I
end
by
entreat
him
to
act
in
her
name
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
power
and
with
the
least
possible
loss
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
letter
to
Mr.
Fairlie
occupy
me
next
.
<EOS>
I
appeal
to
him
on
the
term
which
I
have
mention
to
Laura
as
the
most
likely
to
make
him
bestir
himself
;
I
enclose
a
copy
of
my
letter
to
the
lawyer
to
show
him
how
serious
the
case
be
,
and
I
represent
our
removal
to
Limmeridge
as
the
only
compromise
which
would
prevent
the
danger
and
distress
of
Laura
's
present
position
from
inevitably
affect
her
uncle
as
well
as
herself
at
no
very
distant
time
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
do
,
and
have
seal
and
direct
the
two
envelope
,
I
go
back
with
the
letter
to
Laura
's
room
,
to
show
her
that
they
be
write
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
anybody
disturb
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
ask
,
when
she
open
the
door
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
have
knock
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
hear
some
one
in
the
outer
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
a
man
or
a
woman
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
woman
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
rustling
of
her
gown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
rustling
like
silk
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
like
silk
.
"
  
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
have
evidently
be
watch
outside
.
<EOS>
the
mischief
she
may
do
by
herself
be
little
to
be
fear
.
<EOS>
but
the
mischief
she
may
do
,
as
a
willing
instrument
in
her
husband
's
hand
,
be
too
formidable
to
be
overlook
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
become
of
the
rustling
of
the
gown
when
you
no
longer
hear
it
in
the
ante
-
room
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
it
go
past
your
wall
,
along
the
passage
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
keep
still
and
listen
,
and
just
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
which
way
do
it
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
towards
your
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
consider
again
.
<EOS>
the
sound
have
not
catch
my
ear
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
then
deeply
absorb
in
my
letter
,
and
I
write
with
a
heavy
hand
and
a
quill
pen
,
scraping
and
scratch
noisily
over
the
paper
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
likely
that
Madame
Fosco
would
hear
the
scraping
of
my
pen
than
that
I
should
hear
the
rustling
of
her
dress
.
<EOS>
another
reason
(
if
I
have
want
one
)
for
not
trust
my
letter
to
the
post
-
bag
in
the
hall
.
  
<EOS>
Laura
see
me
think
.
<EOS>
"
More
difficulty
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
wearily
;
"
more
difficulty
and
more
danger
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
danger
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
some
little
difficulty
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
be
think
of
the
safe
way
of
put
my
two
letter
into
Fanny
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
really
write
them
,
then
?
<EOS>
oh
,
Marian
,
run
no
risk
 
pray
,
pray
run
no
risk
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
 
no
fear
.
<EOS>
let
me
see
 
what
o'clock
be
it
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
quarter
to
six
.
<EOS>
there
would
be
time
for
me
to
get
to
the
village

before

if
I
wait
till
the
evening
I
may
find
no
second
opportunity
of
safely
leave

about

if

hear

inquiry
make
,
call
through
the
door
,
and
say
that
I
be
go
out
for
a
walk

<EOS>

when
shall
you
be
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
before
dinner
,
without
fail
.
<EOS>
courage
,
my
love

<EOS>
by
this
time
to
-
morrow
you
will
have
a
clear
-
headed
,
trustworthy
man
act
for
your
good
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
's
partner
be
our
next
good
friend
to
Mr.
Gilmore
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
moment
's
reflection
,
as
soon
as
I
be
alone
,
convince
me
that
I
have
well
not
appear
in
my
walking
-
dress
until
I
have
first
discover
what
be
go
on
in
the
low
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
ascertain
yet
whether
Sir
Percival
be
indoor
or
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
singing
of
the
canary
in
the
library
,
and
the
smell
of
tobacco
-
smoke
that
come
through
the
door
,
which
be
not
closed
,
tell
me
at
once
where
the
Count
be
.
<EOS>
I
look
over
my
shoulder
as
I
pass
the
doorway
,
and
see
to
my
surprise
that
he
be
exhibit
the
docility
of
the
bird
in
his
most
engagingly
polite
manner
to
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
specially
invite
her
to
see
them
 
for
she
would
never
have
think
of
go
into
the
library
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
the
man
's
slight
action
have
a
purpose
of
some
kind
at
the
bottom
of
every
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
what
could
be
his
purpose
here
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
time
then
to
inquire
into
his
motive
.
<EOS>
I
look
about
for
Madame
Fosco
next
,
and
find
her
follow
her
favourite
circle
round
and
round
the
fish
-
pond
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
doubtful
how
she
would
meet
me
,
after
the
outbreak
of
jealousy
of
which
I
have
be
the
cause
<EOS>
so
short
a
time
since
.
<EOS>
but
her
husband
have
tame
her
in
the
interval
,
and
she
now
speak
to
me
with
the
same
civility
as
usual
.
<EOS>
My
only
object
in
address
myself
to
her
be
to
ascertain
if
she
know
what
have
become
of
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
I
contrive
to
refer
to
him
indirectly
,
and
after
a
little
fence
on
either
side
she
at
last
mention
that
he
have
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
which
of
the
horse
have
he
take
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
carelessly
.
  
<EOS>
"
none
of
them
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
go
away
two
hour
since
on
foot
.
<EOS>
as
I
understand
it
,
his
object
be
to
make
fresh
inquiry
about
the
woman
name
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
He
appear
to
be
unreasonably
anxious
about
trace
her
.
<EOS>
do
you
happen
to
know
if
she
be
dangerously
mad
,
Miss
Halcombe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
Countess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
will
soon
be
time
to
dress
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
enter
the
house
together
.
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
stroll
into
the
library
,
and
close
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
go
at
once
to
fetch
my
hat
and
shawl
.
<EOS>
every
moment
be
of
importance
,
if
I
be
to
get
to
Fanny
at
the
inn
and
be
back
before
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
cross
the
hall
again
no
one
be
there
,
and
the
singing
of
the
bird
in
the
library
have
cease
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
stop
to
make
any
fresh
investigation
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
assure
myself
that
the
way
be
clear
,
and
then
leave
the
house
with
the
two
letter
safe
in
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
on
my
way
to
the
village
I
prepare
myself
for
the
possibility
of
meet
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
I
have
him
to
deal
with
alone
<EOS>
I
feel
certain
of
not
lose
my
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
any
woman
who
be
sure
of
her
own
wit
be
a
match
at
any
time
for
a
man
who
be
not
sure
of
his
own
temper
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
such
fear
of
Sir
Percival
as
I
have
of
the
Count
.
<EOS>
instead
of
flutter
,
it
have
compose
me
,
to
hear
of
the
errand
on
which
he
have
go
out
.
<EOS>
while
the
tracing
of
Anne
Catherick
be
the
great
anxiety
that
occupy
him
,
Laura
and
I
may
hope
for
some
cessation
of
any
active
persecution
at
his
hand
.
<EOS>
for
our
sake
now
,
as
well
as
for
Anne
's
,
I
hope
and
pray
fervently
that
she
may
still
escape
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
on
as
briskly
as
the
heat
would
let
me
till
I
reach
the
cross
-
road
which
lead
to
the
village
,
look
back
from
time
to
time
to
make
sure
that
I
be
not
follow
by
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
be
behind
me
all
the
way
but
an
empty
country
waggon
.
<EOS>
the
noise
make
by
the
lumber
wheel
annoy
me
,
and
when
I
find
that
the
waggon
take
the
road
to
the
village
,
as
well
as
myself
,
I
stop
to
let
it
go
by
and
pass
out
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
as
I
look
toward
it
,
more
attentively
than
before
,
I
think
I
detect
at
interval
the
foot
of
a
man
walk
close
behind
it
,
the
carter
be
in
front
,
by
the
side
of
his
horse
.
<EOS>
the
part
of
the
cross
-
road
which
I
have
just
pass
over
be
so
narrow
that
the
waggon
come
after
me
brush
the
tree
and
thicket
on
either
side
,
and
I
have
to
wait
until
it
go
by
before
I
could
test
the
correctness
of
my
impression
.
<EOS>
apparently
that
impression
be
wrong
,
for
when
the
waggon
have
pass
me
the
road
behind
it
be
quite
clear
.
  
<EOS>
I
reach
the
inn
without
meet
Sir
Percival
,
and
without
notice
anything
more
,
and
be
glad
to
find
that
the
landlady
have
receive
Fanny
with
all
possible
kindness
.
<EOS>
the
girl
have
a
little
parlour
to
sit
in
,
away
from
the
noise
of
the
taproom
,
and
a
clean
bedchamber
at
the
top
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
begin
cry
again
at
the
sight
of
me
,
and
say
,
poor
soul
,
truly
enough
,
that
it
be
dreadful
to
feel
herself
turn
out
into
the
world
as
if
she
have
commit
some
unpardonable
fault
,
when
no
blame
could
be
lay
at
her
door
by
anybody
 
not
even
by
her
master
,
who
have
send
her
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
try
to
make
the
good
of
it
,
Fanny
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
Your
mistress
and
I
will
stand
your
friend
,
and
will
take
care
that
your
character
shall
not
suffer

<EOS>
now
,
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
very
little
time
to
spare
,
and
I
be
go
to
put
a
great
trust
in

<EOS>
I
wish
you
to
take
care
of

no

of
the
last
importance

your
mistress
's
interest

<EOS>
Fanny
put
the
letter
into
the
bosom
of
her
dress
.
<EOS>
"
there
they
shall
stop

when

when
I
get
back

I
have
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
spare

put
myself
in

the
dinner
-
bell
rang
<EOS>
and
I
hasten
away
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
take
Madame
Fosco
into
the
dining
-
room
,
and
the
Count
give
me
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
be
hot
and
flushed
,
and
be
not
dress
with
his
customary
care
and
completeness
.
<EOS>
have
he
,
too
,
be
out
before
dinner
,
and
be
late
in
get
back
?
<EOS>
or
be
he
only
suffer
from
the
heat
a
little
more
severely
than
usual
?
  
<EOS>
however
this
may
be
,
he
be
unquestionably
trouble
by
some
secret
annoyance
or
anxiety
,
which
,
with
all
his
power
of
deception
,
he
be
not
able
entirely
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
through
the
whole
of
dinner
he
be
almost
as
silent
as
Sir
Percival
himself
,
and
he
,
every
now
and
then
,
look
at
his
wife
with
an
expression
of
furtive
uneasiness
which
be
quite
new
in
my
experience
of
him
.
<EOS>
the
one
social
obligation
which
he
seem
to
be
self
-
possess
enough
to
perform
as
carefully
as
ever
be
the
obligation
of
be
persistently
civil
and
attentive
to
me
.
<EOS>
what
vile
object
he
have
in
view
I
can
not
still
discover
,
but
be
the
design
what
it
may
,
invariable
politeness
towards
myself
,
invariable
humility
towards
Laura
,
and
invariable
suppression
(
at
any
cost
)
of
Sir
Percival
's
clumsy
violence
,
<EOS>
have
be
the
mean
he
have
resolutely
and
impenetrably
use
to
get
to
his
end
ever
since
he
set
foot
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
it
when
he
first
interfere
in
our
favour
,
on
the
day
when
the
deed
be
produce
in
the
library
,
and
I
feel
certain
of
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
when
Madame
Fosco
and
I
rise
to
leave
the
table
,
the
Count
rise
also
to
accompany
us
back
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
go
away
for
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Sir
Percival
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
you
,
Fosco

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
away
because
I
have
have
dinner
enough
,
and
wine
enough

"
answer
the
Count
.
"
<EOS>
be
so
kind
,
Percival
,
as
to
make
allowance
for
my
foreign
habit
of
go
out
with
the
lady
,
as
well
as
come
in
with
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
nonsense
!
<EOS>
another
glass
of
claret
will
not
hurt
you
.
<EOS>
sit
down
again
like
an
Englishman
.
<EOS>
I
want
half
an
hour
's
quiet
talk
with
you
over
our
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
quiet
talk
,
Percival
,
with
all
my
heart
,
but
not
now
,
and
not
over
the
wine
.
<EOS>
later
in
the
evening
,
if
you
please
 
later
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
civil
!
"
say
Sir
Percival
savagely
.
"
<EOS>
civil
behaviour
,
upon
my
soul
,
to
a
man
in
his
own
house
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
more
than
once
see
him
look
at
the
Count
uneasily
during
dinner
-
time
,
and
have
observe
that
the
Count
carefully
abstain
from
look
at
him
in
return
.
<EOS>
this
circumstance
,
couple
with
the
host
's
anxiety
for
a
little
quiet
talk
over
the
wine
,
and
the
guest
's
obstinate
resolution
not
to
sit
down
again
at
the
table
,
revive
in
my
memory
the
request
which
Sir
Percival
have
vainly
address
to
his
friend
earlier
in
the
day
to
come
out
of
the
library
and
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
Count
have
defer
grant
that
private
interview
,
when
it
be
first
ask
for
in
the
afternoon
,
and
have
again
defer
grant
it
,
when
it
be
a
second
time
ask
for
at
the
dinner
-
table
.
<EOS>
whatever
the
come
subject
of
discussion
between
them
may
be
,
it
be
clearly
an
important
subject
in
Sir
Percival
's
estimation
 
and
perhaps
(
judge
from
his
evident
reluctance
to
approach
it
)
a
dangerous
subject
as
well
,
in
the
estimation
of
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
these
consideration
occur
to
me
while
we
be
pass
from
the
dining
-
room
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
angry
commentary
on
his
friend
's
desertion
of
him
have
not
produce
the
slight
effect
.
<EOS>
the
Count
obstinately
accompany
us
to
the
tea
-
table
 
wait
a
minute
or
two
in
the
room
 
go
out
into
the
hall
 
and
return
with
the
post
-
bag
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
eight
o'clock
 
the
hour
at
which
the
letter
be
always
despatch
from
Blackwater
Park
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
letter
for
the
post
,
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
approach
me
with
the
bag
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
Madame
Fosco
,
who
be
make
the
tea
,
pause
,
with
the
sugar
-
tong
in
her
hand
,
to
listen
for
my
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Count
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
no
letter
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
give
the
bag
to
the
servant
,
who
be
then
in
the
room
;
sit
down
at
the
piano
,
and
play
the
air
of
the
lively
Neapolitan
street
-
song
,
"
La
mia
Carolina
,
"
twice
over
.
<EOS>
His
wife
,
who
be
usually
the
most
deliberate
of
woman
in
all
her
movement
,
make
the
tea
as
quickly
as
I
could
have
make
it
myself
 
finish
her
own
cup
in
two
minute
,
and
quietly
glide
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
rise
to
follow
her
example
 
partly
because
I
suspect
her
of
attempt
some
treachery
upstairs
with
Laura
,
partly
because
I
be
resolve
not
to
remain
alone
in
the
same
room
with
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
could
get
to
the
door
the
Count
stop
me
,
by
a
request
for
a
cup
of
tea
.
<EOS>
I
give
him
the
cup
of
tea
,
and
try
a
second
time
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
He
stop
me
again
 
this
time
by
go
back
to
the
piano
,
and
suddenly
appeal
to
me
on
a
musical
question
in
which
he
declare
that
the
honour
of
his
country
be
concern
.
  
<EOS>
I
vainly
plead
my
own
total
ignorance
of
music
,
and
total
want
of
taste
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
He
only
appeal
to
me
again
with
a
vehemence
which
set
all
further
protest
on
my
part
at
defiance
.
"
<EOS>
the
English
and
the
Germans
(
he
indignantly
declare
)
be
always
revile
the
Italians
for
their
inability
to
cultivate
the
high
kind
of
music
.
<EOS>
We
be
perpetually
talk
of
our
oratorio
,
and
they
be
perpetually
talk
of
their
symphony
.
<EOS>
do
we
forget
and
do
they
forget
his
immortal
friend
and
countryman
,
Rossini
?
<EOS>
what
be
Moses
in
Egypt
but
a
sublime
oratorio
,
which
be
act
on
the
stage
instead
of
be
coldly
sing
in
a
concert
-
room
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
overture
to
Guillaume
Tell
but
a
symphony
under
another
name
?
<EOS>
have
I
hear
Moses
in
Egypt
?
<EOS>
Would
I
listen
to
this
,
and
this
,
and
this
,
and
say
if
anything
more
sublimely
sacred
and
grand
have
ever
be
compose
by
mortal
man
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
without
wait
for
a
word
of
assent
or
dissent
on
my
part
,
look
me
hard
in
the
face
all
the
time
,
he
begin
thunder
on
the
piano
,
and
singe
to
it
with
loud
and
lofty
enthusiasm
 
only
interrupt
himself
,
at
interval
,
to
announce
to
me
fiercely
the
title
of
the
different
piece
of
music
:
"
Chorus
of
Egyptians
in
the
Plague
of
Darkness
,
Miss
Halcombe
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Recitativo
of
Moses
with
the
table
of
the
Law
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Prayer
of
Israelites
,
at
the
passage
of
the
Red
Sea
.
<EOS>
aha
!
<EOS>
aha
!
<EOS>
be
that
sacred
?
<EOS>
be
that
sublime
?
"
<EOS>
the
piano
tremble
under
his
powerful
hand
,
and
the
teacup
on
the
table
rattle
,
as
his
big
bass
voice
thunder
out
the
note
,
and
his
heavy
foot
beat
time
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
horrible
 
something
fierce
and
devilish
 
in
the
outburst
of
his
delight
at
his
own
singing
and
playing
,
and
in
the
triumph
with
which
he
watch
its
effect
upon
me
as
I
shrink
nearer
and
near
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
be
release
at
last
,
not
by
my
own
effort
,
but
by
Sir
Percival
's
interposition
.
<EOS>
He
open
the
dining
-
room
door
,
and
call
out
angrily
to
know
what
"
that
infernal
noise
"
mean
.
<EOS>
the
Count
instantly
get
up
from
the
piano
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
if
Percival
be
come
,
"
he
say
,
"
harmony
and
melody
be
both
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
the
Muse
of
Music
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
desert
us
in
dismay
,
and
I
,
the
fat
old
minstrel
,
exhale
the
rest
of
my
enthusiasm
in
the
open
air
!
"
<EOS>
He
stalk
out
into
the
verandah
,
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
resume
the
Recitativo
of
Moses
,
sotto
voce
,
in
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
Sir
Percival
call
after
him
from
the
dining
-
room
window
.
<EOS>
but
he
take
no
notice
 
<EOS>
he
seem
determined
not
to
hear
.
<EOS>
that
long
-
defer
quiet
talk
between
them
be
still
to
be
put
off
,
be
still
to
wait
for
the
Count
's
absolute
will
and
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
detain
me
in
the
drawing
-
room
nearly
half
an
hour
from
the
time
when
his
wife
leave
us
.
<EOS>
where
have
she
be
,
and
what
have
she
be
do
in
that
interval
?
  
<EOS>
I
go
upstairs
to
ascertain
,
but
I
make
no
discovery
,
and
when
I
question
Laura
,
I
find
that
she
have
not
hear
anything
.
<EOS>
nobody
have
disturb
her
,
no
faint
rustling
of
the
silk
dress
have
be
audible
,
either
in
the
ante
-
room
or
in
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
then
twenty
minute
to
nine
.
<EOS>
after
go
to
my
room
to
get
my
journal
,
I
return
,
and
sit
with
Laura
,
sometimes
write
,
sometimes
stop
to
talk
with
her
.
<EOS>
nobody
come
near
us
,
and
nothing
happen
.
<EOS>
We
remain
together
till
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
then
rise
,
say
my
last
cheering
word
,
and
wish
her
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
She
lock
her
door
again
after
we
have
arrange
that
I
should
come
in
and
see
her
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
few
sentence
more
to
add
to
my
diary
before
go
to
bed
myself
,
and
as
I
go
down
again
to
the
drawing
-
room
after
leave
Laura
for
the
last
time
that
weary
day
,
I
resolve
merely
to
show
myself
there
,
to
make
my
excuse
,
and
then
to
retire
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
for
the
night

It

the
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
She

a
strange
emphasis

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
"

Sir

a
headache
as
mine

"
  
<EOS>
I
take
my
leave
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
same
insolent
smile
on
the
woman
's
face
when
I
shake
hand
with

<EOS>
Sir

He

<EOS>
the
Count

to
himself
behind
his

<EOS>
there
be
yet
another
delay
to
that
quiet
talk
with
Sir
Percival
 
and
<EOS>
the
Countess
be
the
impediment
this
time
.
    
<EOS>
June
19th
.
 
<EOS>
once
safely
shut
into
my
own
room
,
I
open
these
page
,
and
prepare
to
go
on
with
that
part
of
the
day
's
record
which
be
still
leave
to
write
.
  
<EOS>
for
ten
minute
or
more
I
sit
idle
,
with
the
pen
in
my
hand
,
think
over
the
event
of
the
last
twelve
hour
.
<EOS>
when
I
at
last
address
myself
to
my
task
,
I
find
a
difficulty
in
proceed
with
it
which
I
have
never
experience
before
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
my
effort
to
fix
my
thought
on
the
matter
in
hand
,
they
wander
away
with
the
strange
persistency
in
the
one
direction
of
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
,
and
all
the
interest
which
I
try
to
concentrate
on
my
journal
centre
instead
in
that
private
interview
between
them
which
have
be
put
off
all
through
the
day
,
and
which
be
now
to
take
place
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
perverse
state
of
my
mind
,
the
recollection
of
what
have
pass
since
the
morning
would
not
come
back
to
me
,
and
there
be
no
resource
but
to
close
my
journal
and
to
get
away
from
it
for
a
little
while
.
  
<EOS>
I
open
the
door
which
lead
from
my
bedroom
into
my
sitting
-
room
,
and
have
pass
through
,
pull
it
to
again
,
to
prevent
any
accident
in
case
of
draught
with
the
candle
leave
on
the
dressing
-
table
.
<EOS>
My
sit
-
room
window
be
wide
open
,
and
I
lean
out
listlessly
to
look
at
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
dark
and
quiet
.
<EOS>
neither
moon
nor
star
be
visible
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
smell
like
rain
in
the
still
,
heavy
air
,
and
I
put
my
hand
out
of
window
.
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
the
rain
be
only
threaten
,
it
have
not
come
yet
.
  
<EOS>
I
remain
lean
on
the
window
-
sill
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
look
out
absently
into
the
black
darkness
,
and
hear
nothing
,
except
now
and
then
the
voice
of
the
servant
,
or
the
distant
sound
of
a
closing
door
,
in
the
low
part
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
I
be
turn
away
wearily
from
the
window
to
go
back
to
the
bedroom
and
make
a
second
attempt
to
complete
the
unfinished
entry
in
my
journal
,
I
smell
the
odour
of
tobacco
-
smoke
steal
towards
me
on
the
heavy
night
air
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
I
see
a
tiny
red
spark
advance
from
the
farther
end
of
the
house
in
the
pitch
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
hear
no
footstep
,
and
I
could
see
nothing
but
the
spark
.
<EOS>
It
travel
along
in
the
night
,
pass
the
window
at
which
I
be
stand
,
and
stop
opposite
my
bedroom
window
,
inside
which
I
have
leave
the
light
burn
on
the
dressing
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
the
spark
remain
stationary
for
a
moment
,
then
move
back
again
in
the
direction
from
which
it
have
advance
.
<EOS>
as
I
follow
its
progress
I
see
a
second
red
spark
,
large
than
the
first
,
approach
from
the
distance
.
<EOS>
the
two
meet
together
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
remember
who
smoke
cigarette
and
who
smoke
cigar
,
I
infer
immediately
that
the
Count
have
come
out
first
to
look
and
listen
under
my
window
,
and
that
Sir
Percival
have
afterwards
join
him
.
<EOS>
They
must
both
have
be
walk
on
the
lawn
 
<EOS>
or
I
should
certainly
have
hear
Sir
Percival
's
heavy
footfall
,
though
the
Count
's
soft
step
may
have
escape
me
,
even
on
the
gravel
walk
.
  
<EOS>
I
wait
quietly
at
the
window
,
certain
that
they
could
neither
of
them
see
me
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
I
hear
Sir
Percival
say
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
come
in
and
sit
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
the
light
out
of
that
window
,
"
reply
the
Count
softly
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
harm
do
the
light
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
show
she
be
not
in
bed
yet
.
<EOS>
She
be
sharp
enough
to
suspect
something
,
and
bold
enough
to
come
downstairs
and
listen
,
if
she
can
get
the
chance
.
<EOS>
Patience
,
Percival
 
patience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humbug
!
<EOS>
You
be
always
talk
of
patience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
talk
of
something
else
presently
.
<EOS>
My
good
friend
,
you
be
on
the
edge
of
your
domestic
precipice
,
and
if
I
let
you
give
the
woman
one
other
chance
,
on
my
sacred
word
of
honour
they
will
push
you
over
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
come
to
our
explanation
,
Percival
,
when
the
light
be
out
of
that
window
,
and
when
I
have
have
one
little
look
at
the
room
on
each
side
of
the
library
,
and
a
peep
at
the
staircase
as
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
slowly
move
away
,
and
the
rest
of
the
conversation
between
them
(
which
have
be
conduct
throughout
in
the
same
low
tone
)
cease
to
be
audible
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
matter
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
enough
to
determine
me
on
justify
the
Count
's
opinion
of
my
sharpness
and
my
courage
.
<EOS>
before
the
red
sparks
be
out
of
sight
in
the
darkness
I
have
make
up
my
mind
that
there
should
be
a
listener
when
those
two
man
sit
down
to
their
talk
 
and
that
the
listener
,
in
spite
of
all
the
Count
's
precaution
to
the
contrary
,
should
be
myself
.
<EOS>
I
want
but
one
motive
to
sanction
the
act
to
my
own
conscience
,
and
to
give
me
courage
enough
for
perform
it
 
and
that
motive
I
have
.
<EOS>
Laura
's
honour
,
Laura
's
happiness
 
Laura
's
life
itself
 
may
depend
on
my
quick
ear
and
my
faithful
memory
to
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hear
the
Count
say
that
he
mean
to
examine
the
room
on
each
side
of
the
library
,
and
the
staircase
as
well
,
before
he
enter
on
any
explanation
with
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
this
expression
of
his
intention
be
necessarily
sufficient
to
inform
me
that
the
library
be
the
room
in
which
he
propose
that
the
conversation
should
take
place
.
<EOS>
the
one
moment
of
time
which
be
long
enough
to
bring
me
to
that
conclusion
be
also
the
moment
which
show
me
a
means
of
baffle
his
precaution
 
or
,
in
other
word
,
of
hear
what
he
and
Sir
Percival
say
to
each
other
,
without
the
risk
of
descend
at
all
into
the
low
region
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
in
speak
of
the
room
on
the
ground
floor
I
have
mention
incidentally
the
verandah
outside
them
,
on
which
they
all
open
by
mean
of
french
window
,
extend
from
the
cornice
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
the
top
of
this
verandah
be
flat
,
the
rain
-
water
be
carry
off
from
it
by
pipe
into
tank
which
help
to
supply
the
house
.
<EOS>
on
the
narrow
leaden
roof
,
which
run
along
past
the
bedroom
,
and
which
be
rather
less
,
I
should
think
,
than
three
foot
below
the
sill
of
the
window
,
a
row
of
flower
-
pot
be
range
,
with
wide
interval
between
each
pot
 
<EOS>
the
whole
be
protect
from
fall
in
high
wind
by
an
ornamental
iron
rail
along
the
edge
of
the
roof
.
  
<EOS>
the
plan
which
have
now
occur
to
me
be
to
get
out
at
my
sit
-
room
window
on
to
this
roof
,
to
creep
along
noiselessly
till
I
reach
that
part
of
it
which
be
immediately
over
the
library
window
,
and
to
crouch
down
between
the
flower
-
pot
,
with
my
ear
against
the
outer
rail
.
<EOS>
if
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
sit
and
smoke
to
-
night
,
as
I
have
see
them
sit
and
smoke
many
night
before
,
with
their
chair
close
at
the
open
window
,
and
their
foot
stretch
on
the
zinc
garden
seat
which
be
place
under
the
verandah
,
every
word
they
say
to
each
other
above
a
whisper
(
and
no
long
conversation
,
as
we
all
know
by
experience
,
can
be
carry
on
in
a
whisper
)
must
inevitably
reach
my
ear
.
<EOS>
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
they
choose
to
-
night
to
sit
far
back
inside
the
room
,
then
the
chance
be
that
I
should
hear
little
or
nothing
 
and
in
that
case
,
I
must
run
the
far
more
serious
risk
of
try
to
outwit
them
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
strongly
as
I
be
fortify
in
my
resolution
by
the
desperate
nature
of
our
situation
,
I
hope
most
fervently
that
I
may
escape
this
last
emergency
.
<EOS>
My
courage
be
only
a
woman
's
courage
after
all
,
and
it
be
very
near
to
fail
me
when
I
think
of
trust
myself
on
the
ground
floor
,
at
the
dead
of
night
,
within
reach
of
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
softly
back
to
my
bedroom
to
try
the
safe
experiment
of
the
verandah
roof
first
.
  
<EOS>
a
complete
change
in
my
dress
be
imperatively
necessary
for
many
reason
.
<EOS>
I
take
off
my
silk
gown
to
begin
with
,
because
the
slight
noise
from
it
on
that
still
night
may
have
betray
me
.
<EOS>
I
next
remove
the
white
and
cumbersome
part
of
my
underclothing
,
and
replace
them
by
a
petticoat
of
dark
flannel
.
<EOS>
over
this
I
put
my
black
travel
cloak
,
and
pull
the
hood
on
to
my
head
.
<EOS>
in
my
ordinary
evening
costume
I
take
up
the
room
of
three
man
at
least
.
<EOS>
in
my
present
dress
,
when
it
be
hold
close
about
me
,
no
man
could
have
pass
through
the
narrow
space
more
easily
than
I.
<EOS>
the
little
breadth
leave
on
the
roof
of
the
verandah
,
between
the
flower
-
pot
on
one
side
and
the
wall
and
the
window
of
the
house
on
the
other
,
make
this
a
serious
consideration
.
<EOS>
if
I
knock
anything
down
,
if
I
make
the
least
noise
,
who
could
say
what
the
consequence
may
be
?
  
<EOS>
I
only
wait
to
put
the
match
near
the
candle
before
I
extinguish
it
,
and
grope
my
way
back
into
the
sitting
-
room
<EOS>
,
I
lock
that
door
,
as
I
have
lock
my
bedroom
door
 
then
quietly
get
out
of
the
window
,
and
cautiously
set
my
foot
on
the
leaden
roof
of
the
verandah
.
  
<EOS>
My
two
room
be
at
the
inner
extremity
of
the
new
wing
of
the
house
in
which
we
all
live
,
and
I
have
five
window
to
pass
before
I
could
reach
the
position
it
be
necessary
to
take
up
immediately
over
the
library
.
<EOS>
the
first
window
belong
to
a
spare
room
which
be
empty
.
<EOS>
the
second
and
third
window
belong
to
Laura
's
room
.
<EOS>
the
fourth
window
belong
to
Sir
Percival
's
room
.
<EOS>
the
fifth
belong
to
the
Countess
's
room
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
by
which
it
be
not
necessary
for
me
to
pass
,
be
the
window
of
the
Count
's
dressing
-
room
,
of
the
bathroom
,
and
of
the
second
empty
spare
room
.
  
<EOS>
no
sound
reach
my
ear
 
<EOS>
the
black
blinding
darkness
of
the
night
be
all
round
me
when
I
first
stand
on
the
verandah
,
except
at
that
part
of
it
which
Madame
Fosco
's
window
overlook
.
<EOS>
there
,
at
the
very
place
above
the
library
to
which
my
course
be
direct
 
there
<EOS>
I
see
a
gleam
of
light
!
<EOS>
the
Countess
be
not
yet
in
bed
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
to
draw
back
 
<EOS>
it
be
no
time
to
wait
.
<EOS>
I
determine
to
go
on
at
all
hazard
,
and
trust
for
security
to
my
own
caution
and
to
the
darkness
of
the
night
.
"
<EOS>
for
Laura
's
sake
!
<EOS>
"
I
think
to
myself
,
as
I
take
the
first
step
forward
on
the
roof
,
with
one
hand
hold
my
cloak
close
round
me
,
and
the
other
grope
against
the
wall
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
to
brush
close
by
the
wall
than
to
risk
strike
my
foot
against
the
flower
-
pot
within
a
few
inch
of
me
,
on
the
other
side
.
  
<EOS>
I
pass
the
dark
window
of
the
spare
room
,
try
the
leaden
roof
at
each
step
with
my
foot
before
I
risk
rest
my
weight
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
pass
the
dark
window
of
Laura
's
room
(
"
God
bless
her
and
keep
her
to
-
night
!
"
)
.
<EOS>
I
pass
the
dark
window
of
Sir
Percival
's
room
.
<EOS>
then
I
wait
a
moment
,
knelt
down
with
my
hand
to
support
me
,
and
so
creep
to
my
position
,
under
the
protection
of
the
low
wall
between
the
bottom
of
the
light
window
and
the
verandah
roof
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
venture
to
look
up
at
the
window
itself
I
find
that
the
top
of
it
only
be
open
,
and
that
the
blind
inside
be
draw
down
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
look
I
see
the
shadow
of
Madame
Fosco
pass
across
the
white
field
of
the
blind
 
then
pass
slowly
back
again
.
<EOS>
thus
far
she
could
not
have
hear
me
,
or
the
shadow
would
surely
have
stop
at
the
blind
,
even
if
she
have
want
courage
enough
to
open
the
window
and
look
out
?
  
<EOS>
I
place
myself
sideways
against
the
railing
of
the
verandah
 
first
ascertaining
,
by
touch
them
,
the
position
of
the
flower
-
pot
on
either
side
of
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
room
enough
for
me
to
sit
between
them
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
the
sweet
-
scented
leave
of
the
flower
on
my
left
hand
just
brush
my
cheek
as
I
lightly
rest
my
head
against
the
railing
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
sound
that
reach
me
from
below
be
cause
by
the
opening
or
closing
(
most
probably
the
latter
)
of
three
door
in
succession
 
the
door
,
no
doubt
,
lead
into
the
hall
and
into
the
room
on
each
side
of
the
library
,
which
the
Count
have
pledge
himself
to
examine
.
<EOS>
the
first
object
that
I
see
be
the
red
spark
again
travel
out
into
the
night
from
under
the
verandah
,
move
away
towards
my
window
,
wait
a
moment
,
and
then
return
to
the
place
from
which
it
have
set
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
devil
take
your
restlessness
!
<EOS>
when
do
you
mean
to
sit
down
?
<EOS>
"
growl
Sir
Percival
's
voice
beneath
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ouf
!
<EOS>
how
hot
it
be
!
"
say
the
Count
,
sigh
and
puff
wearily
.
  
<EOS>
His
exclamation
be
follow
by
the
scraping
of
the
garden
chair
on
the
tile
pavement
under
the
verandah
 
the
welcome
sound
which
tell
me
they
be
go
to
sit
close
at
the
window
as
usual
.
<EOS>
so
far
the
chance
be
mine
.
<EOS>
the
clock
in
the
turret
strike
the
quarter
to
twelve
as
they
settle
themselves
in
their
chair
.
<EOS>
I
hear
Madame
Fosco
through
the
open
window
yawning
,
and
see
her
shadow
pass
once
more
across
the
white
field
of
the
blind
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
begin
talk
together
below
,
now
and
then
drop
their
voice
a
little
low
than
usual
,
but
never
sink
them
to
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
the
strangeness
and
peril
of
my
situation
,
the
dread
,
which
I
could
not
master
,
of
Madame
Fosco
's
light
window
,
make
it
difficult
,
almost
impossible
,
for
me
,
at
first
,
to
keep
my
presence
of
mind
,
and
to
fix
my
attention
solely
on
the
conversation
beneath
.
<EOS>
for
some
minute
I
could
only
succeed
in
gather
the
general
substance
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
understand
the
Count
to
say
that
the
one
window
alight
be
his
wife
's
,
that
the
ground
floor
of
the
house
be
quite
clear
,
and
that
they
may
now
speak
to
each
other
without
fear
of
accident
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
merely
answer
by
upbraid
his
friend
with
have
unjustifiably
slight
his
wish
and
neglect
his
interest
all
through
the
day
.
<EOS>
the
Count
thereupon
defend
himself
by
declare
that
he
have
be
beset
by
certain
trouble
and
anxiety
which
have
absorb
all
his
attention
,
and
that
the
only
safe
time
to
come
to
an
explanation
be
a
time
when
they
could
feel
certain
of
be
neither
interrupt
nor
overheard
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
at
a
serious
crisis
in
our
affair
,
Percival
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
if
we
be
to
decide
on
the
future
at
all
,
we
must
decide
secretly
to
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
that
sentence
of
the
Count
's
be
the
first
which
my
attention
be
ready
enough
to
master
exactly
as
it
be
speak
.
<EOS>
from
this
point
,
with
certain
break
and
interruption
,
my
whole
interest
fix
breathlessly
on
the
conversation
,
and
I
follow
it
word
for
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
crisis
?
<EOS>
"
repeat
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
bad
crisis
than
you
think
for
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
should
suppose
,
from
your
behaviour
for
the
last
day
or
two
,
"
return
the
other
coolly
.
"
<EOS>
but
wait
a
little
.
<EOS>
before
we
advance
to
what
I
do
not
know
,
let
us
be
quite
certain
of
what
I
do
know
.
<EOS>
let
us
first
see
if
I
be
right
about
the
time
that
be
past
,
before
I
make
any
proposal
to
you
for
the
time
that
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
stop
till
I
get
the
brandy
and
water
.
<EOS>
have
some
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Percival

cold
water

pleasure

a
spoon

basin

"
now
listen
,
Percival
.
<EOS>
I
will
put
our
position
plainly
before
you
,
as
I
understand
it
,
and
you
shall
say
if
I
be
right
or
wrong

<EOS>
You

I
both
come
back
to
this
house
from
the
Continent
with
our
affair
very
seriously
embarrassed

cut
it
short

<EOS>
I
want
some
thousand

well

in
your
own
solid
english
word

you
want
some
thousand

I
want

the
only

do
I
tell
you
about
your

our
way

England

what
do
I
tell
you
again

I
say
this
:
human
ingenuity

my
friend

have
hitherto
only
discover
two
way
in
which
a
man
can
manage

one
way
be

the

enough

the
manner
of

clear

do
you
suspect
the

close
their

her

She
be
just
mad
enough
to

shut
up

from

I
look
out

darkness
of
last
night

I
look
out
now
at
the
bright
stillness
of
the
morning

<EOS>
I
count
the
hour
that
have
pass
since
I
escape
to
the
shelter
of
this
room
by
my
own
sensation
 
and
those
hour
seem
like
week
.
  
<EOS>
how
short
a
time
,
and
yet
how
long
to
me
 
since
I
sink
down
in
the
darkness
,
here
,
on
the
floor
 
drench
to
the
skin
,
cramp
in
every
limb
,
cold
to
the
bone
,
a
useless
,
helpless
,
panic
-
stricken
creature

<EOS>
I
hardly
know
when
I
rouse
myself

<EOS>
I
hardly
know
when
I
grope
my
way
back
to
the
bedroom
,
and
light
the
candle
,
and
search
(
with
a
strange
ignorance
,
at
first
,
of
where
to
look
for
them
)
for
dry
clothe
to
warm
me

<EOS>
the
doing

these
thing
be
in
my
mind

not
the
time
when
they
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
Can
I
even
remember
when
the
chill
,
cramp
feeling
leave
me
,
and
the
throbbing
heat
come
in
its
place
?
  
<EOS>
surely
it
be
before
the
sun
rise
?
<EOS>
yes
,
I
hear
the
clock
strike
three
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
time
by
the
sudden
brightness
and
clearness
,
the
feverish
strain
and
excitement
of
all
my
faculty
which
come
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
remember
my
resolution
to
control
myself
,
to
wait
patiently
hour
after
hour
,
till
the
chance
offer
of
remove
Laura
from
this
horrible
place
,
without
the
danger
of
immediate
discovery
and
pursuit
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
persuasion
settle
itself
in
my
mind
that
the
word
those
two
man
have
say
to
each
other
would
furnish
us
,
not
only
with
our
justification
for
leave
the
house
,
but
with
our
weapon
of
defence
against
them
as
well
.
<EOS>
I
recall
the
impulse
that
awaken
in
me
to
preserve
those
word
in
writing
,
exactly
as
they
be
speak
,
while
the
time
be
my
own
,
and
while
my
memory
vividly
retain
them

all
this
I
remember
plainly
:
there
be
no
confusion
in
my

POSTSCRIPT
by
a
sincere
friend
  
<EOS>
the
illness
of
our
excellent
Miss
Halcombe
have
afford
me
the
opportunity
of
enjoy
an
unexpected
intellectual
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
I
refer
to
the
perusal
(
which
I
have
just
complete
)
of
this
interesting
Diary
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
hundred
page
here
.
<EOS>
I
can
lay
my
hand
on
my
heart
,
and
declare
that
every
page
have
charm
,
refresh
,
delight
me
.
  
<EOS>
to
a
man
of
my
sentiment
it
be
unspeakably
gratify
to
be
able
to
say
this
.
  
<EOS>
admirable
woman
!
  
<EOS>
I
allude
to
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
stupendous
effort
!
  
<EOS>
I
refer
to
the
Diary
.
  
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
these
page
be
amazing
.
<EOS>
the
tact
which
I
find
here
,
the
discretion
,
the
rare
courage
,
the
wonderful
power
of
memory
,
the
accurate
observation
of
character
,
the
easy
grace
of
style
,
the
charming
outburst
of
womanly
feel
,
have
all
inexpressibly
increase
my
admiration
of
this
sublime
creature
,
of
this
magnificent
Marian
.
<EOS>
the
presentation
of
my
own
character
be
masterly
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
I
certify
,
with
my
whole
heart
,
to
the
fidelity
of
the
portrait
.
<EOS>
I
feel
how
vivid
an
impression
I
must
have
produce
to
have
be
paint
in
such
strong
,
such
rich
,
such
massive
colour
as
these
.
<EOS>
I
lament
afresh
the
cruel
necessity
which
set
our
interest
at
variance
,
and
oppose
us
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
under
happy
circumstance
how
worthy
I
should
have
be
of
Miss
Halcombe
 
how
worthy
Miss
Halcombe
would
have
be
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
sentiment
which
animate
my
heart
assure
me
that
the
line
I
have
just
write
express
a
Profound
Truth
.
  
<EOS>
those
sentiment
exalt
me
above
all
merely
personal
consideration
.
<EOS>
I
bear
witness
,
in
the
most
disinterested
manner
,
to
the
excellence
of
the
stratagem
by
which
this
unparalleled
woman
surprise
the
private
interview
between
Percival
and
myself
 
also
to
the
marvellous
accuracy
of
her
report
of
the
whole
conversation
from
its
beginning
to
its
end
.
  
<EOS>
those
sentiment
have
induce
me
to
offer
to
the
unimpressionable
doctor
who
attend
on
her
my
vast
knowledge
of
chemistry
,
and
my
luminous
experience
of
the
more
subtle
resource
which
medical
and
magnetic
science
have
place
at
the
disposal
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
He
have
hitherto
decline
to
avail
himself
of
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
miserable
man
!
  
<EOS>
finally
,
those
sentiment
dictate
the
line
 
grateful
,
sympathetic
,
paternal
line
 
which
appear
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
I
close
the
book
.
<EOS>
My
strict
sense
of
propriety
restore
it
(
by
the
hand
of
my
wife
)
to
its
place
on
the
writer
's
table
.
<EOS>
event
be
hurry
me
away
.
<EOS>
circumstance
be
guide
me
to
serious
issue
.
<EOS>
vast
perspective
of
success
unroll
themselves
before
my
eye
.
<EOS>
I
accomplish
my
destiny
with
a
calmness
which
be
terrible
to
myself
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
homage
of
my
admiration
be
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
deposit
it
with
respectful
tenderness
at
the
foot
of
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
I
breathe
my
wish
for
her
recovery
.
  
<EOS>
I
condole
with
her
on
the
inevitable
failure
of
every
plan
that
she
have
form
for
her
sister
's
benefit
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
I
entreat
her
to
believe
that
the
information
which
I
have
derive
from
her
Diary
will
in
no
respect
help
me
to
contribute
to
that
failure
.
<EOS>
It
simply
confirm
the
plan
of
conduct
which
I
have
previously
arrange
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
thank
these
page
for
awaken
the
fine
sensibility
in
my
nature
 
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
to
a
person
of
similar
sensibility
this
simple
assertion
will
explain
and
excuse
everything
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
be
a
person
of
similar
sensibility
.
  
<EOS>
in
that
persuasion
I
sign
myself
,
Fosco

the
manner
in
which
Mr.
Fairlie
's
Narrative
and
other
narrative
that
be
shortly
to
follow
it
,
be
originally
obtain
,
form
the
subject
of
an
explanation
which
will
appear
at
a
later
period
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
grand
misfortune
of
my
life
that
nobody
will
let
me
alone
.
  
<EOS>
why
 
I
ask
everybody
 
why
worry
me
?
<EOS>
nobody
answer
that
question
,
and
nobody
let
me
alone
.
<EOS>
relative
,
friend
,
and
stranger
all
combine
to
annoy
me
.
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
ask
myself
,
I
ask
my
servant
,
Louis
,
fifty
time
a
day
 
what
have
I
do
?
<EOS>
neither
of
us
can
tell
.
<EOS>
Most
extraordinary
!
  
<EOS>
the
last
annoyance
that
have
assail
me
be
the
annoyance
of
be
call
upon
to
write
this
Narrative
.
<EOS>
be
a
man
in
my
state
of
nervous
wretchedness
capable
of
write
narrative
?
<EOS>
when
I
put
this
extremely
reasonable
objection
,
I
be
tell
that
certain
very
serious
event
relate
to
my
niece
have
happen
within
my
experience
,
and
that
I
be
the
fit
person
to
describe
them
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
I
be
threaten
if
I
fail
to
exert
myself
in
the
manner
require
,
with
consequence
which
I
can
not
so
much
as
think
of
without
perfect
prostration
.
<EOS>
there
be
really
no
need
to
threaten
me
.
<EOS>
shatter
by
my
miserable
health
and
my
family
trouble
,
I
be
incapable
of
resistance
.
<EOS>
if
you
insist
,
you
take
your
unjust
advantage
of
me
,
and
I
give
way
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
to
remember
what
I
can
(
under
protest
)
,
and
to
write
what
I
can
(
also
under
protest
)
,
and
what
I
can
not
remember
and
can
not
write
,
Louis
must
remember
and
write
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
ass
,
and
I
be
an
invalid
,
and
we
be
likely
to
make
all
sort
of
mistake
between
us
.
<EOS>
how
humiliating
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
tell
to
remember
date
.
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
I
never
do
such
a
thing
in
my
life
 
<EOS>
how
be
I
to
begin
now
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
ask
Louis
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
quite
such
an
ass
as
I
have
hitherto
suppose
.
<EOS>
He
remember
the
date
of
the
event
,
within
a
week
or
two
 
and
I
remember
the
name
of
the
person
.
<EOS>
the
date
be
towards
the
end
of
June
,
or
the
beginning
of
July
,
and
the
name
(
in
my
opinion
a
remarkably
vulgar
one
)
be
Fanny
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
June
,
or
the
beginning
of
July
,
then
,
I
be
recline
in
my
customary
state
,
surround
by
the
various
object
of
art
which
I
have
collect
about
me
to
improve
the
taste
of
the
barbarous
people
in
my
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
I
have
the
photograph
of
my
picture
,
and
print
,
and
coin
,
and
so
forth
,
all
about
me
,
which
I
intend
,
one
of
these
day
,
to
present
(
the
photograph
,
I
mean
,
if
the
clumsy
english
language
will
let
me
mean
anything
)
to
present
to
the
institution
at
Carlisle
(
horrid
place
!
)
,
with
a
view
to
improve
the
taste
of
the
member
(
Goths
and
Vandals
to
a
man
)
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
suppose
that
a
gentleman
who
be
in
course
of
confer
a
great
national
benefit
on
his
countryman
be
the
last
gentleman
in
the
world
to
be
unfeelingly
worried
about
private
difficulty
and
family
affair
.
<EOS>
quite
a
mistake
,
I
assure
you
,
in
my
case
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
there
I
be
,
recline
,
with
my
art
-
treasure
about
me
,
and
want
a
quiet
morning
.
<EOS>
because
I
want
a
quiet
morning
,
of
course
Louis
come
in
.
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
natural
that
I
should
inquire
what
the
deuce
he
mean
by
make
his
appearance
when
I
have
not
ring
my
bell
.
<EOS>
I
seldom
swear
 
it
be
such
an
ungentlemanlike
habit
 
<EOS>
but
when
Louis
answer
by
a
grin
,
I
think
it
be
also
perfectly
natural
that
I
should
damn
him
for
grin
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
this
rigorous
mode
of
treatment
,
I
have
observe
,
invariably
bring
person
in
the
low
class
of
life
to
their
sense
.
<EOS>
It
bring
Louis
to
his
sense
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
obliging
as
to
leave
off
grin
,
and
inform
me
that
a
young
person
be
outside
want
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
He
add
(
with
the
odious
talkativeness
of
servant
)
,
that
her
name
be
Fanny
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
Fanny
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Glyde
's
maid

<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Miss
Halcombe

sir

"
  
<EOS>
the
moment
I
hear
Miss
Halcombe
's
name
I
give
up
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
habit
of
mine
always
to
give
up
to
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
I
find
,
by
experience
,
that
it
save
noise
.
<EOS>
I
give
up
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
dear
Marian
!
  
<EOS>
"
let
Lady
Glyde
's
maid
come
in
,
Louis
.
<EOS>
stop
!
<EOS>
do
her
shoe
creak
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
ask
the
question
.
<EOS>
creaking
shoe
invariably
upset
me
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
I
be
resign
to
see
the
Young
person
,
but
I
be
not
resign
to
let
the
Young
Person
's
shoe
upset
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
limit
even
to
my
endurance
.
  
<EOS>
Louis
affirm
distinctly
that
her
shoe
be
to
be
depend
upon
.
<EOS>
I
wave
my
hand
.
<EOS>
He
introduce
her
.
<EOS>
be
it
necessary
to
say
that
she
express
her
sense
of
embarrassment
by
shut
up
her
mouth
and
breathe
through
her
nose
?
<EOS>
to
the
student
of
female
human
nature
in
the
low
order
,
surely
not
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
do
the
girl
justice
.
<EOS>
Her
shoe
do
not
creak
.
<EOS>
but
why
do
Young
Persons
in
service
all
perspire
at
the
hand
?
<EOS>
why
have
they
all
get
fat
nose
and
hard
cheek
?
<EOS>
and
why
be
their
face
so
sadly
unfinished
,
especially
about
the
corner
of
the
eyelid
?
<EOS>
I
be
not
strong
enough
to
think
deeply
myself
on
any
subject
,
but
I
appeal
to
professional
man
,
who
be
.
<EOS>
why
have
we
no
variety
in
our
breed
of
young
Persons
?
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
letter
for
me
,
from
Miss
Halcombe
?
<EOS>
put
it
down
on
the
table
,
please
,
and
do
not
upset
anything
.
<EOS>
how
be
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
thank
you
,
sir
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
Lady
Glyde
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
receive
no
answer
.
<EOS>
the
Young
Person
's
face
become
more
unfinished
than
ever
,
and
I
think
she
begin
to
cry
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
see
something
moist
about
her
eye
.
<EOS>
tear
or
perspiration
?
<EOS>
Louis
(
whom
I
have
just
consult
)
be
incline
to
think
,
tear
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
her
class
of
life
,
and
he
ought
to
know
best
.
<EOS>
let
us
say
,
tear
.
  
<EOS>
except
when
the
refining
process
of
Art
judiciously
remove
from
them
all
resemblance
to
Nature
,
I
distinctly
object
to
tear
.
<EOS>
tear
be
scientifically
describe
as
a
Secretion
.
<EOS>
I
can
understand
that
a
secretion
may
be
healthy
or
unhealthy
,
but
I
can
not
see
the
interest
of
a
secretion
from
a
sentimental
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
perhaps
my
own
secretion
be
all
wrong
together
,
I
be
a
little
prejudiced
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
no
matter
.
<EOS>
I
behave
,
on
this
occasion
,
with
all
possible
propriety
and
feeling
.
<EOS>
I
close
my
eye
and
say
to
Louis
    
"
Endeavour
to
ascertain
what
she
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Louis
endeavour
,
and
the
Young
Person
endeavour
.
<EOS>
They
succeed
in
confuse
each
other
to
such
an
extent
that
I
be
bind
in
common
gratitude
to
say
,
they
really
amuse
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
send
for
them
again
when
I
be
in
low
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
mention
this
idea
to
Louis
.
<EOS>
strange
to
say
,
it
seem
to
make
him
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
poor
devil
!
  
<EOS>
surely
I
be
not
expect
to
repeat
my
niece
's
maid
's
explanation
of
her
tear
,
interpret
in
the
English
of
my
swiss
valet
?
<EOS>
the
thing
be
manifestly
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
can
give
my
own
impression
and
feeling
perhaps
.
<EOS>
Will
that
do
as
well
?
<EOS>
please
say
,
yes
.
  
<EOS>
My
idea
be
that
she
begin
by
tell
me
(
through
Louis
)
that
her
master
have
dismiss
her
from
her
mistress
's
service
.
<EOS>
(
observe
,
throughout
,
the
strange
irrelevancy
of
the
Young
Person
.
<EOS>
be
it
my
fault
that
she
have
lose
her
place
?
)
<EOS>
on
her
dismissal
,
she
have
go
to
the
inn
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
(
I
do
not
keep
the
inn
 
<EOS>
why
mention
it
to
me
?
)
<EOS>
between
six
o'clock
and
seven
Miss
Halcombe
have
come
to
say
good
-
bye
,
and
have
give
her
two
letter
,
one
for
me
,
and
one
for
a
gentleman
in
London
.
<EOS>
(
I
be
not
a
gentleman
in
London
 
<EOS>
hang
the
gentleman
in
London
!
)
<EOS>
She
have
carefully
put
the
two
letter
into
her
bosom
(
what
have
I
to
do
with
her
bosom
?
)
;
she
have
be
very
unhappy
,
when
Miss
Halcombe
have
go
away
again
;
she
have
not
have
the
heart
to
put
bit
or
drop
between
her
lip
till
it
be
near
bedtime
,
and
then
,
when
it
be
close
on
nine
o'clock
,
she
have
think
she
should
like
a
cup
of
tea
.
<EOS>
(
be
I
responsible
for
any
of
these
vulgar
fluctuation
,
which
begin
with
unhappiness
and
end
with
tea
?
)
<EOS>
just
as
she
be
warm
the
POT
<EOS>
(
I
give
the
word
on
the
authority
of
Louis
,
who
say
he
know
what
they
mean
,
and
wish
to
explain
,
but
I
snub
him
on
principle
)
 
just
as
she
be
warm
the
pot
the
door
open
,
and
she
be
strike
of
a
HEAP
(
her
own
word
again
,
and
perfectly
unintelligible
this
time
to
Louis
,
as
well
as
to
myself
)
by
the
appearance
in
the
inn
parlour
of
her
ladyship
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
I
give
my
niece
's
maid
's
description
of
my
sister
's
title
with
a
sense
of
the
high
relish
.
<EOS>
My
poor
dear
sister
be
a
tiresome
woman
who
marry
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
to
resume
:
the
door
open
,
her
ladyship
the
Countess
appear
in
the
parlour
,
and
the
Young
Person
be
strike
of
a
heap
.
<EOS>
most
remarkable
!
  
<EOS>
I
must
really
rest
a
little
before
I
can
get
on
any
farther
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
recline
for
a
few
minute
,
with
my
eye
closed
,
and
when
Louis
have
refresh
my
poor
ache
temple
with
a
little
eau
-
de
-
Cologne
,
I
may
be
able
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
the
Countess
    
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
be
able
to
proceed
,
but
not
to
sit
up
.
<EOS>
I
will
recline
and
dictate
.
<EOS>
Louis
have
a
horrid
accent
,
but
he
know
the
language
,
and
can
write
.
<EOS>
how
very
convenient
!
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
,
the
Countess
,
explain
her
unexpected
appearance
at
the
inn
by
tell
Fanny
that
she
have
come
to
bring
one
or
two
little
message
which
Miss
Halcombe
in
her
hurry
have
forget
.
<EOS>
the
Young
Person
thereupon
wait
anxiously
to
hear
what
the
message
be
,
but
the
Countess
seem
disinclined
to
mention
them
(
so
like
my
sister
's
tiresome
way
!
)
<EOS>
until
Fanny
have
have
her
tea
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
be
surprisingly
kind
and
thoughtful
about
it
(
extremely
unlike
my
sister
)
,
and
say
,
"
I
be
sure
,
my
poor
girl
,
you
must
want
your
tea
.
<EOS>
We
can
let
the
message
wait
till
afterwards
.
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
<EOS>
if
nothing
else
will
put
you
at
your
ease
,
I
will
make
the
tea
and
have
a
cup
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
those
be
the
word
,
as
report
excitably
,
in
my
presence
,
by
the
Young
Person
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
the
Countess
insist
on
make
the
tea
,
and
carry
her
ridiculous
ostentation
of
humility
so
far
as
to
take
one
cup
herself
,
and
to
insist
on
the
girl
's
take
the
other
.
<EOS>
the
girl
drink
the
tea
,
and
accord
to
her
own
account
,
solemnise
the
extraordinary
occasion
five
minute
afterwards
by
faint
dead
away
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
here
again
I
use
her
own
word
.
<EOS>
Louis
think
they
be
accompany
by
an
increase
secretion
of
tear
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
myself
.
<EOS>
the
effort
of
listen
be
quite
as
much
as
I
could
manage
,
my
eye
be
close
.
  
<EOS>
where
do
I
leave
off
?
<EOS>
ah
,
yes
 
she
faint
after
drink
a
cup
of
tea
with
the
Countess
 
<EOS>
a
proceeding
which
may
have
interested
me
if
I
have
be
her
medical
man
,
but
be
nothing
of
the
sort
<EOS>
I
feel
bored
by
hear
of
it
,
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
when
she
come
to
herself
in
half
an
hour
's
time
she
be
on
the
sofa
,
and
nobody
be
with
her
but
the
landlady
.
<EOS>
the
Countess
,
find
it
too
late
to
remain
any
longer
at
the
inn
,
have
go
away
as
soon
as
the
girl
show
sign
of
recover
,
and
the
landlady
have
be
good
enough
to
help
her
upstairs
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
leave
by
herself
,
she
have
feel
in
her
bosom
<EOS>
(
I
regret
the
necessity
of
refer
to
this
part
of
the
subject
a
second
time
)
,
and
have
find
the
two
letter
there
quite
safe
,
but
strangely
crumple
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
giddy
in
the
night
,
but
have
get
up
well
enough
to
travel
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
She
have
put
the
letter
address
to
that
obtrusive
stranger
,
the
gentleman
in
London
into
the
post
,
and
have
now
deliver
the
other
letter
into
my
hand
as
she
be
tell
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
plain
truth
,
and
though
she
could
not
blame
herself
for
any
intentional
neglect
,
she
be
sadly
troubled
in
her
mind
,
and
sadly
in
want
of
a
word
of
advice
.
<EOS>
at
this
point
Louis
think
the
secretion
appear
again
.
<EOS>
perhaps
they
do
,
but
it
be
of
infinitely
great
importance
to
mention
that
at
this
point
also
I
lose
my
patience
,
open
my
eye
,
and
interfere
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
purport
of
all
this
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
My
niece
's
irrelevant
maid
stare
,
and
stand
speechless
.
  
<EOS>
"
endeavour
to
explain
,
"
I
say
to
my
servant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
translate
me
,
Louis
.
"
  
<EOS>
Louis
endeavour
and
translate
.
<EOS>
in
other
word
,
he
descend
immediately
into
a
bottomless
pit
of
confusion
,
and
the
Young
Person
follow
him
down
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
know
when
I
have
be
so
amused
.
<EOS>
I
leave
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
as
long
as
they
divert
me
.
<EOS>
when
they
cease
to
divert
me
,
I
exert
my
intelligence
,
and
pull
them
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
unnecessary
to
say
that
my
interference
enable
me
,
in
due
course
of
time
,
to
ascertain
the
purport
of
the
Young
Person
's
remark
.
  
<EOS>
I
discover
that
she
be
uneasy
in
her
mind

the
train
of
event
that
she

just
describe
to
me
have
prevent
her
from
receive
those
supplementary
message
which
Miss
Halcombe
have
intrust
to
the
Countess
to
deliver

<EOS>
She
be
afraid
the
message
may
have
be
of
great
importance
to
her
mistress
's
interest

<EOS>
Her
dread
of
Sir
Percival
have
deter
her
from
go
to
Blackwater
Park
late
at
night
to
inquire
about
them
,

Miss
Halcombe
's
own
direction
to
her

on
no
account
to
miss
the
train
in
the
morning

have
prevent

from
wait
at

next

She
be
most
anxious
that
the
misfortune
of
her
fainting
-
fit
should
not
lead
to
the
second
misfortune
of
make
her
mistress
think
her
neglectful

she
would
humbly
beg
to
ask
me
whether
I
would
advise
her
to
write
her
explanation
and
excuse
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
request
to
receive
the
message
by
letter

if
it
be
not
too
late

<EOS>
I
make
no
apology
for
this
extremely
prosy
paragraph

<EOS>
I
have
be
order
to
write
it

<EOS>
there
be
people
,
unaccountable

it

appear

who
actually
take
more
interest
in
what
my

as

I
have
a
little
nap
 
<EOS>
I
really
want
it

<EOS>
when
I
awake
again
I
notice
dear
Marian

letter
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
have
the
least
idea

what
it
contain
I
should
certainly
not

<EOS>
be
,
unfortunately
for
myself
,
quite
innocent
of
all
suspicion
,
I
read
the
letter

<EOS>
It
immediately
upset
me
for
the
day

<EOS>
I
be
,
by
nature
,
one
of
the
most
easy
-
tempered
creature
that
ever
live
 
<EOS>
I
make
allowance
for
everybody
,
and
I
take
offence
at
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
have
before
remark
,
there
be
limit
to
my
endurance
.
<EOS>
I
lay
down
Marian
's
letter
,
and
feel
myself
 
justly
feel
myself
 
an
injured
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
make
a
remark
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
of
course
,
applicable
to
the
very
serious
matter
now
under
notice
,
or
I
should
not
allow
it
to
appear
in
this
place
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
,
in
my
opinion
,
set
the
odious
selfishness
of
mankind
in
such
a
repulsively
vivid
light
as
the
treatment
,
in
all
class
of
society
,
which
the
single
people
receive
at
the
hand
of
the
married
people
.
<EOS>
when
you
have
once
show
yourself
too
considerate
and
self
-
deny
to
add
a
family
of
your
own

an
already
overcrowded
population

you
be
vindictively
mark
out
by
your

who
have
no
similar
consideration
and
no
similar
self
-
denial

I
considerately

inconsiderately

what
do
he
do

<EOS>
He
leave
his

me

<EOS>
She
be
a
sweet
girl
 
<EOS>
she
be
also
a
dreadful
responsibility

<EOS>
why
lie
her
on

<EOS>
because
I
be
bind

harmless

<EOS>
I
do

poor

<EOS>
poor
human

<EOS>
It
be
quite
unnecessary
to
say
that
Marian
's
letter
threaten
me
.
<EOS>
everybody
threaten
me
.
<EOS>
all
sort
of
horror
be
to
fall
on
my
devoted
head
if
I
hesitate
to
turn
Limmeridge
House
into
an
asylum
for
my
niece
and
her
misfortune
.
<EOS>
I
do
hesitate
,
nevertheless
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
mention
that
my
usual
course
,
hitherto
,
have
be
to
submit
to
dear
Marian
,
and
save
noise
.
<EOS>
but
on
this
occasion
,
the
consequence
involve
in
her
extremely
inconsiderate
proposal
be
of
a
nature
to
make
me
pause
.
<EOS>
if
I
open
Limmeridge
House
as
an
asylum
to
Lady
Glyde
,
what
security
have
I
against
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
<EOS>
follow
her
here
in
a
state
of
violent
resentment
against
me
for
harbour
his
wife
?
<EOS>
I
see
such
a
perfect
labyrinth
of
trouble
involve
in
this
proceeding
that
I
determine
to
feel
my
ground
,
as
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
write
,
therefore
,
to
dear
Marian
to
beg
(
as
she
have
no
husband
to
lay
claim
to
her
)
that
she
would
come
here
by
herself
,
first
,
and
talk
the
matter
over
with
me
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
answer
my
objection
to
my
own
perfect
satisfaction
,
then
I
assure
her
that
I
would
receive
our
sweet
Laura
with
the
great
pleasure
,
but
not
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
,
of
course
,
at
the
time
,
that
this
temporising
on
my
part
would
probably
end
in
bring
Marian
here
in
a
state
of
virtuous
indignation
,
bang
door
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
the
other
course
of
proceeding
may
end
in
bring
Sir
Percival
here
in
a
state
of
virtuous
indignation
,
bang
door
also
,
and
of
the
two
indignation
and
banging
<EOS>
I
prefer
Marian
's
,
because
I
be
use
to
her
.
<EOS>
accordingly
I
despatch
the
letter
by
return
of
post
.
<EOS>
It
gain
me
time
,
at
all
event
 
<EOS>
and
,
oh
dear
me
!
<EOS>
what
a
point
that
be
to
begin
with
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
totally
prostrate
(
do
I
mention
that
I
be
totally
prostrate
by
Marian
's
letter
?
)
<EOS>
it
always
take
me
three
day
to
get
up
again
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
unreasonable
 
<EOS>
I
expect
three
day
of
quiet
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
do
not
get
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
day
's
post
bring
me
a
most
impertinent
letter
from
a
person
with
whom
I
be
totally
unacquainted
.
<EOS>
He
describe
himself
as
the
act
partner
of
our
man
of
business
 
our
dear
,
pig
-
head
old
Gilmore
 
<EOS>
and
he
inform
me
that
he
have
lately
receive
,
by
the
post
,
a
letter
address
to
him
in
Miss
Halcombe
's
handwriting
.
<EOS>
on
open
the
envelope
,
he
have
discover
,
to
his
astonishment
,
that
it
contain
nothing
but
a
blank
sheet
of
note
-
paper
.
<EOS>
this
circumstance
appear
to
him
so
suspicious
(
as
suggest
to
his
restless
legal
mind
that
the
letter
have
be
tamper
with
)
that
he
have
at
once
write
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
have
receive
no
answer
by
return
of
post
.
<EOS>
in
this
difficulty
,
instead
of
act
like
a
sensible
man
and
let
thing
take
their
proper
course
,
his
next
absurd
proceeding
,
on
his
own
showing
,
be
to
pester
me
by
write
to
inquire
if
I
know
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
what
the
deuce
should
I
know
about
it
?
<EOS>
why
alarm
me
as
well
as
himself
?
<EOS>
I
write
back
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
my
keen
letter
.
<EOS>
I
have
produce
nothing
with
a
sharp
epistolary
edge
to
it
since
I
tender
his
dismissal
in
write
to
that
extremely
troublesome
person
,
Mr.
Walter
Hartright
.
  
<EOS>
My
letter
produce
its
effect
.
<EOS>
I
hear
nothing
more
from
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
this
perhaps
be
not
altogether
surprising
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
certainly
a
remarkable
circumstance
that
no
second
letter
reach
me
from
Marian
,
and
that
no
warning
sign
appear
of
her
arrival
.
<EOS>
Her
unexpected
absence
do
me
amazing
good
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
very
soothing
and
pleasant
to
infer
(
as
I
do
of
course
)
that
my
married
connection
have
make
it
up
again
.
<EOS>
five
day
of
undisturbed
tranquillity
,
of
delicious
single
blessedness
,
quite
restore
me
.
<EOS>
on
the
sixth
day
I
feel
strong
enough
to
send
for
my
photographer
,
and
to
set
him
at
work
again
on
the
presentation
copy
of
my
art
-
treasure
,
with
a
view
,
as
I
have
already
mention
,
to
the
improvement
of
taste
in
this
barbarous
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
dismiss
him
to
his
workshop
,
and
have
just
begin
coquet
with
my
coin
,
when
Louis
suddenly
make
his
appearance
with
a
card
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
another
young
person
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
see
her

my
state
of
health

gentleman
this
time

<EOS>
a
gentleman
of
course
make
a
difference
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
card
.
  
<EOS>
Gracious
Heaven
!
<EOS>
my
tiresome
sister
's
foreign
husband
,
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
necessary
to
say
what
my
first
impression
be
when
I
look
at
my
visitor
's
card
?
<EOS>
surely
not
!
<EOS>
My
sister
have
marry
a
foreigner
,
there
be
but
one
impression
that
any
man
in
his
sense
could
possibly
feel
.
<EOS>
of
course
the
Count
have
come
to
borrow
money
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Louis
,
"
I
say
,
"
do
you
think
he
would
go
away
if
you
give
him
five
shilling
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Louis
look
quite
shocked
.
<EOS>
He
surprise
me
inexpressibly
by
declare
that
my
sister
's
foreign
husband
be
dress
superbly
,
and
look
the
picture
of
prosperity
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
my
first
impression
alter
to
a
certain
extent
.
<EOS>
I
now
take
it
for
grant
that
the
Count
have
matrimonial
difficulty
of
his
own
to
contend
with
,
and
that
he
have
come
,
like
the
rest
of
the
family
,
to
cast
them
all
on
my
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
mention
his
business
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
Count
Fosco

he
have
come
here

because
Miss
Halcombe

unable
to
leave

Park

"
  
<EOS>
fresh
trouble
,
apparently
.
<EOS>
not
exactly
his
own
,
as
I
have
suppose
,
but
dear
Marian
's
.
<EOS>
trouble
,
anyway
.
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
  
<EOS>
"
show
him
in
,
"
I
say
resignedly
.
  
<EOS>
the
Count
's
first
appearance
really
startle
me
.
<EOS>
He
be
such
an
alarmingly
large
person
that
I
quite
tremble
.
<EOS>
I
feel
certain
that
he
would
shake
the
floor
and
knock
down
my
art
-
treasure
.
<EOS>
He
do
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
.
<EOS>
He
be
refreshingly
dressed
in
summer
costume
 
<EOS>
his
manner
be
delightfully
self
-
possessed
and
quiet
 
<EOS>
he
have
a
charming
smile
.
<EOS>
My
first
impression
of
him
be
highly
favourable
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
creditable
to
my
penetration
 
as
the
sequel
will
show
 
to
acknowledge
this
,
but
I
be
a
naturally
candid
man
,
and
I
do
acknowledge
it
notwithstanding
.
  
<EOS>
"
allow
me
to
present
myself

he
say
.

I
come
from

a
contrast

extremely
considerate

delightfully
confidential

<EOS>
when

remember
at

that
the
unscrupulous

I
have
endeavour

assist

regular
medical
attendant

uninfectious
nature

He
be
too
yellow
to

<EOS>
He
look
like
a
walk

west

epidemic

<EOS>
He
be
big
enough
to
carry
typhus

the
ton

to
dye

scarlet
fever

You

<EOS>
I
fervently
hope
that
this
remarkably
broad
hint
would
throw
him
off
his
balance
 
<EOS>
confuse
him
 
reduce
him
to
polite
apology
 
in
short

get
him
out

on

contrary

additionally
solemn

up

first

I

bear
my
testimony

with
profound
sorrow

to
the
lamentable
disagreement
between
Sir
Percival

Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
I
be
Sir
Percival

old
friend
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
be
an
eye
-
witness
of
all
that
have
happen
at
Blackwater
Park

<EOS>
in
those
three
capacity
I
speak
with
authority

with
confidence

with
honourable
regret

<EOS>
Sir

I
inform
you
,
as
the
head
of
Lady
Glyde

family
,
that
Miss
Halcombe
have
exaggerate
nothing
in
the
letter
which
she
write
to
your
address

<EOS>
I
affirm
that
the
remedy
which
that
admirable
lady
have
propose
be
the
only
remedy
that
will
spare
you
the
horror
of
public
scandal
.
<EOS>
a
temporary
separation
between
husband
and
wife
be
the
one
peaceable
solution
of
this
difficulty

them
for
the
present

cause
of
irritation

,
I
,
who
have
now
the
honour
of
address
you
 
I
will
undertake
to
bring
Sir
Percival
to
reason
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
be
innocent
,
Lady
Glyde
be
injure
,
but
 
follow
my
thought
here
!
 
<EOS>
she
be
,
on
that
very
account
(
I
say
it
with
shame
)
,
the
cause
of
irritation
while
she
remain
under
her
husband
's
roof
.
<EOS>
no
other
house

receive
her
with

yours

fold

his
coat

to
come
out
from
the
North
of
England
and
take
my
share
of
the
pelting

<EOS>
I
try
to
put
the
point
forcibly

just
as
I
have
put
it
here

Count

lower
one
of
his
horrid
finger

keep
the
other
up

go
on

down

to

You

most
right

to
receive
the
wife
until
you
be
quite
certain
that
the
husband
will
not
exert
his
authority
to
reclaim
her

I
agree
to
that
.
<EOS>
I

you

which
you

I

all

be
bind
in
the
sacred
interest
of
the
family
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
with
all
my
soul

I
advise
you
to
remove
the
serious
responsibility
of
delay
from
your
own
shoulder
by
write
to
Lady
Glyde
to
come
here
at

can
lay
the
blame
on
you

<EOS>
I
speak

large
experience
 
<EOS>
I
offer
my
friendly
advice
.
<EOS>
be
it
accept
 
<EOS>
yes
,
or
no
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
 
<EOS>
merely
look
at
him
 
with
my
sense
of
his
amazing
assurance
,
and
my
dawn
resolution
to
ring
for
Louis
and
have
him
show
out
of
the
room
express
in
every
line
of
my
face
.
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
incredible
,
but
quite
true
,
that
my
face
do
not
appear
to
produce
the
slight
impression
on
him
.
<EOS>
bear
without
nerve
 
evidently
bear
without

"
You
hesitate

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
!
<EOS>
I
understand
that
hesitation
.
<EOS>
You
object
 
<EOS>
see
,
sir
,
how
my
sympathy
look
straight
down
into
your
thought
!
 
<EOS>
you
object
that
Lady
Glyde
be
not
in
health
and
not
in
spirit
to
take
the
long
journey
,
from
Hampshire
to
this
place
,
by
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
own
maid
be
remove
from
her
,
as
you

and
of
other

fit
to
travel
with
her
,
from
one
end
of
England
to
another
,
there
be
none
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
You
object
,
again
,
that
she
can
not
comfortably
stop
and
rest
in
London
,
on
her
way
here
,
because
she
can
not
comfortably
go
alone
to
a
public
hotel
where
she
be
a
total
stranger
.
<EOS>
in
one
breath

I
grant
both
objection
 
in
another
breath

I
remove
them
.
<EOS>
follow
me
,
if
you
please

for
the
last

<EOS>
It

my
intention

when

so
obliging

this
fact
in
your
mind

and
observe
the
programme
I
now
propose
.

<EOS>
I
cordially

<EOS>
He
wave
his
horrid
hand
at
me
 
he
strike
his
infectious
breast
 
<EOS>
he
address
me
oratorically
,
as
if
I
be
lay
up
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
It
be
high
time
to
take
a
desperate
course
of
some
sort
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
high
time
to
send
for
Louis
,
and
adopt
the
precaution
of
fumigate
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
try
emergency
an
idea
occur
to
me
 
an
inestimable
idea
which
,
so
to
speak
,
kill
two
intrusive
bird
with
one
stone
.
<EOS>
I
determine
to
get
rid
of
the
Count
's
tiresome
eloquence
,
and
of
Lady
Glyde
's
tiresome
trouble
,
by
comply
with
this
odious
foreigner
's
request
,
and
write
the
letter
at
once
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
least
danger
of
the
invitation
be
accept
,
for
there
be
not
the
least
chance
that
Laura
would
consent
to
leave
Blackwater
Park
while
Marian
be
lie
there
ill
.
<EOS>
how
this
charmingly
convenient
obstacle
could
have
escape
the
officious
penetration
of
the
Count
,
it
be
impossible
to
conceive
 
<EOS>
but
it
have
escape
him
.
<EOS>
My
dread
that
he
may
yet
discover
it
,
if
I
allow
him
any
more
time
to
think
,
stimulate
me
to
such
an
amazing
degree
,
that
I
struggle
into
a
sit
position
 
seize
,
really
seize
,
the
writing
material
by
my
side
,
and
produce
the
letter
as
rapidly
as
if
I
have
be
a
common
clerk
in
an
office

<EOS>
I
close
my
eye
 
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
hear
as
little
as
possible
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
my
endeavour
I
be
oblige
to
hear
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
My

congratulate
himself
,
and
congratulate

on
the

the
necessity

importance

three
day
'
time
 
he
beg
my
permission

look
forward
to
our
next
meeting
,
instead
of
pain
himself
and
pain
me
,
by
say
farewell
 
he
add
a
great
deal
more
,
which
,
I
rejoice
to
think
,
I
do
not
attend
to
at
the
time
,
and
do
not
remember
now
.
<EOS>
I
hear
his
sympathetic
voice
travel
away
from
me
by
degree
 
<EOS>
but
,
large
as
he
be
,
I
never
hear
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
negative
merit
of
be
absolutely
noiseless
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
when
he
open
the
door
,
or
when
he
shut
it
.
<EOS>
I
venture
to
make
use
of
my
eye
again
,
after
an
interval
of
silence
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
I
ring
for
Louis
,
and
retire
to
my
bathroom
.
<EOS>
tepid
water
,
strengthen
with
aromatic
vinegar
,
for
myself
,
and
copious
fumigation
for
my
study
,
be
the
obvious
precaution
to
take
,
and
of
course
I
adopt
them
.
<EOS>
I
rejoice
to
say
they
prove
successful
.
<EOS>
I
enjoy
my
customary
siesta
.
<EOS>
I
awake
moist
and
cool
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
inquiry
be
for
the
Count
.
<EOS>
have
we
really
get
rid
of
him
?
<EOS>
yes
 
he
have
go
away
by
the
afternoon
train
.
<EOS>
have
he
lunch
,
and
if
so
,
upon
what
?
<EOS>
entirely
upon
fruit
-
tart
and
cream
.
<EOS>
what
a
man
!
<EOS>
what
a
digestion
!
  
<EOS>
be
I
expect
to
say
anything
more
?
<EOS>
I
believe
not
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
reach
the
limit
assign
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
shocking
circumstance
which
happen
at
a
later
period
do
not
,
I
be
thankful
to
say
,
happen
in
my
presence
.
<EOS>
I
do
beg
and
entreat
that
nobody
will
be
so
very
unfeeling
as
to
lay
any
part
of
the
blame
of
those
circumstance
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
everything
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
answerable
for
a
deplorable
calamity
,
which
it
be
quite
impossible
to
foresee
.
<EOS>
I
be
shatter
by
it
 
<EOS>
I
have
suffer
under
it
,
as
nobody
else
have
suffer
.
<EOS>
My
servant
,
Louis
(
who
be
really
attach
to
me
in
his
unintelligent
way
)
,
think
I
shall
never
get
over
it
.
<EOS>
He
see
me
dictate
at
this
moment
,
with
my
handkerchief
to
my
eye
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
mention
,
in
justice
to
myself
,
that
it
be
not
my
fault
,
and
that
I
be
quite
exhausted
and
heartbroken
.
<EOS>
need
<EOS>
I
say
more

the
STORY
continue
by
ELIZA
MICHELSON
  
<EOS>
(
housekeeper
at
Blackwater
Park
)
      
<EOS>
I
be
ask
to
state
plainly
what
I
know
of
the
progress
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
illness
and
of
the
circumstance
under
which
Lady
Glyde
leave
Blackwater
Park
for
London
.
  
<EOS>
the
reason
give
for
make
this
demand
on
me
be
,
that
my
testimony
be
want
in
the
interest
of
truth
.
<EOS>
as
the
widow
of
a
clergyman
of
the
Church
of
England
(
reduce
by
misfortune
to
the
necessity
of
accept
a
situation
)
,
I
have
be
teach
to
place
the
claim
of
truth
above
all
other
consideration
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
comply
with
a
request
which
I
may
otherwise
,
through
reluctance
to
connect
myself
with
distress
family
affair
,
have
hesitate
to
grant
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
memorandum
at
the
time
,
and
I
can
not
therefore
be
sure
to
a
day
of
the
date
,
but
I
believe
I
be
correct
in
state
that
Miss
Halcombe
's
serious
illness
begin
during
the
last
fortnight
or
ten
day
in
June
.
<EOS>

sometimes
as

<EOS>
on
the

to
which
I

Miss
Halcombe

who
be
usually

do
not
make
her

the
upper
housemaid

send
to
see
after
her
,
and
come
run
out
of
the
room
dreadfully
frighten
.
<EOS>
I
meet
the
servant
on
the
stair
,
and
go
at
once
to
Miss
Halcombe
to
see
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
the
poor

Lady
Glyde

without

her
my

be
the
first
to
come
in
from
her
own
bedroom
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
dreadfully
alarm
and
distress
that
she
be
quite
useless
.
<EOS>
the
Count
Fosco
,
and
his
lady
,
who
come
upstairs
immediately
afterwards
,
be
both
most
serviceable
and
kind

<EOS>
Her

His

for
Miss
Halcombe

and
a
cool
lotion
to
be
apply
to
her
head
,
so
as
to
lose
no
time
before
the
doctor
come
.
<EOS>
We
apply
the
lotion
,
but
we
could
not
get
her
to
take
the
mixture
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
undertake
to
send
for
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
He
despatch
a
groom
,
on
horseback
,
for
the
near

,
Mr.
Dawson
,
of
Oak
Lodge
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
arrive
in
less
than
an
hour
's
time
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
respectable
elderly
man
,
well
know
<EOS>
all
round
the
country
,
and
we
be
much
alarm
when
we
find
that
he
consider
the
case
to
be
a
very
serious
one
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
the
Count
affably
enter
into
conversation
with
Mr.
Dawson
,
and
give
his
opinion
with
a
judicious
freedom
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
,
not
over
-
courteously
,
inquire
if
his
lordship
's
advice
be
the
advice
of
a
doctor
,
and
be
inform
that
it
be
the
advice
of
one
who
have
study
medicine
unprofessionally
,
reply
that
he
be
not
accustom
to
consult
with
amateur
physician
.
<EOS>
the
Count
,
with
truly
christian
meekness
of
temper
,
smile
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
before
he
go
out
he
tell
me
that
he
may
be
find
,
in
case
he
be
want
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
at
the
boat

house
on

<EOS>
why

should
have
go

I
can
not

but
he
do
go
,
remain
away
the
whole
day
till
seven
o'clock

which
be
dinner

time

<EOS>
perhaps
he
wish
to
set
the
example
of
keep
the
house
as
quiet
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
be
entirely
in

<EOS>
Lady

<EOS>
She
be
much
too
nervous

too
delicate
in
health
to
bear
the
anxiety
of

Halcombe
's
illness
calmly
.
<EOS>
She
only
do
herself
harm

<EOS>
a

gentle

affectionate
lady
never

but
she
cry

and
she
be
frightened

two
weakness
which
make

appear
much
confused

unsettle
in

<EOS>
His

on
the
contrary

a
become
composure
and
interest

<EOS>
He

his
straw
hat
in

<EOS>
Sir
Percival
be
not
civil
enough
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
ought
in
justice
to
say
,
not
compose
enough
 
to
take
leave
of
me
with
the
same
polite
attention
.
<EOS>
the
only
person
in
the
house
,
indeed
,
who
treat
me
,
at
that
time
or
at
any
other
,
on
the
footing
of
a
lady
in
distressed
circumstance
,
be
the
Count
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
manner
of
a
true
nobleman
 
<EOS>
he
be
considerate
towards
every
one
.
<EOS>
even
the
young
person
(
Fanny
by
name
)
who
attend
on
Lady
Glyde
be
not
beneath
his
notice
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
send
away
by
Sir
Percival
,
his
lordship
(
show
me
his
sweet
little
bird
at
the
time
)
be
most
kindly
anxious
to
know
what
have
become
of
her
,
where
she
be
to
go
the
day
she
leave
Blackwater
Park
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
such
little
delicate
attention
that
the
advantage
of
aristocratic
birth
always
show
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
apology
for
introduce
these
particular
 
they
be
bring
forward
in
justice
to
his
lordship
,
whose
character
,
I
have
reason
to
know
,
be
view
rather
harshly
in
certain
quarter
.
<EOS>
a
nobleman
who
can
respect
a
lady
in
distressed
circumstance
,
and
can
take
a
fatherly
interest
in
the
fortune
of
an
humble
servant
girl
,
show
principle
and
feeling
of
too
high
an
order
to
be
lightly
call
in
question

<EOS>
I
advance
no
opinion
 
<EOS>
I
offer
fact
only

<EOS>
My
endeavour
through
life
be
to
judge
not

<EOS>
one
of
my
beloved

fine
sermon
be
on

<EOS>
I
read
it
constantly
 
in
my
own
copy
of
the

in
the
first
day
of
my
widowhood
 
and
at
every
fresh
perusal
I
derive
an
increase
of
spiritual
benefit
and
edification
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
improvement
in
Miss
Halcombe

and
the
second
night
be
even
bad
than
the
first

Mr.

nothing

"
  
<EOS>
towards
midday
I
go
downstairs
to
attend
to
some
of
my
regular
duty
.
<EOS>
an
hour
afterwards
,
on
my
way
back
to
the
sick

room

I
see
the
Count
(
who
have
go
out
again
early

for

enter
the
hall

to

<EOS>
Sir

,
at
the

moment
,
put
his

out

and
address
his

with
extreme
eagerness

<EOS>
His

large

become
dimple
all
over

placid
smile

he
make
no

<EOS>
at
the

Sir
Percival
turn
his
head
,
observe
that
I

You

It
be
certainly
time
you

I
may
be
the

nothing

<EOS>
I
express
my
grateful
acknowledgment
for
his
lordship
's
kind
consideration
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
cut
them
short
by
call
to
his
noble
friend
(
use
,
I
regret
to
say
,
a
profane
expression
)
to
come
into
the
library
,
and
not
to
keep
him
wait
there
any
longer
.
  
<EOS>
I
proceed
upstairs
.
<EOS>
We
be
poor
erring
creature
,
and
however
well
establish
<EOS>
a
woman
's
principle
may
be
she
can
not
always
keep
on
her
guard
against
the
temptation
to
exercise
an
idle
curiosity

<EOS>
I
be
ashamed
to
say
that
an
idle
curiosity
,
on
this
occasion
,
get
the
well
of
my
principle
,
and
make
me
unduly
inquisitive
about
the
question
which
Sir
Percival
have
address
to
his
noble
friend
at
the
library
door
.
<EOS>
who
be
the
Count
expect
to
find
in
the
course
of
his
studious
morning
ramble
at
Blackwater
Park
?
<EOS>
a
woman
,
it
be
to
be
presume
,
from
the
term
of
Sir
Percival
's
inquiry
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suspect
the
Count
of
any
impropriety
 
<EOS>
I
know
his
moral
character
too
well
.
<EOS>
the
only
question
I
ask
myself
be
 
<EOS>
have
he
find
her
?
  
<EOS>
to
resume
.
<EOS>
the
night
pass
as
usual
without
produce
any
change
for
the
well
in
Miss
Halcombe

<EOS>
the
next
day
she
seem
to
improve
a
little
.
<EOS>
the
day
after
that
her
ladyship
the
Countess

without

the
object

her
journey
to
any
one
in

morning
train
to
London
 
<EOS>
her
noble
husband

with
his
customary
attention

station

<EOS>
I
be
now
leave
in
sole
charge
of
Miss
Halcombe

with
every
apparent
chance
,
in
consequence
of
her
sister
's
resolution
not
to
leave
the
bedside
,
of
have
Lady
Glyde
herself
to
nurse
next
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
circumstance
of
any
importance
that
happen
in
the
course
of
the
day
be
the
occurrence
of
another
unpleasant
meeting
between
the
doctor
and
the
Count

<EOS>
His
lordship
,
on
return
from
the
station
,
step
up
into
Miss
Halcombe
's
sitting
-
room
to
make
his
inquiry

<EOS>
I
go
out
from
the
bedroom
to
speak
to
him
,
Mr.
Dawson
and
Lady
Glyde
be
both
with
the
patient
at
the
time

<EOS>
the
Count
ask
me
many
question
about
the
treatment
and
the
symptom
.
<EOS>
I
inform
him
that
the
treatment
be
of
the
kind
describe
as
"
saline
,
"
and
that
the
symptom
,
between
the
attack
of
fever
,
be
certainly
those
of
increase
weakness
and
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
be
mention
these
last
particular
,
Mr.
Dawson
come
out
from
the
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
morning

sir
,
"
say
his
lordship
,
step
forward
in
the
most
urbane
manner
,
and
stop
the
doctor
,
with
a
high
-
breed
resolution
impossible
to
resist
,
"
I
greatly
fear
you
find
no
improvement
in
the
symptom
to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
decide
improvement

"
answer
Mr.
Dawson
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
still
persist
in
your
lower
treatment
of
this
case
of
fever
?
"
continue
his
lordship
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
persist
in
the
treatment
which
be
justify
by
my
own
professional
experience
,
"
say
Mr.
Dawson
.
  
<EOS>
"
permit
me
to
put
one
question
to
you
on
the
vast
subject
of
professional
experience

"
observe
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
I
presume
to
offer
no
more
advice
 
<EOS>
I
only
presume
to
make
an
inquiry
.
<EOS>
You
live
at
some
distance
,
sir
,
from
the
gigantic
centre
of
scientific
activity
 
London
and
Paris

<EOS>
have
you
ever
hear
of
the
waste
effect

intelligibly

by
fortify
the
exhaust
patient

brandy

<EOS>
have
that
new
heresy

high
medical
authority
ever
reach
your
ear
 
<EOS>
yes
or
no

"
  
<EOS>
"
when
a
professional
man
put
that
question
to
me
I
shall
be
glad
to
answer
him
,

say
the
doctor
,
open
the
door
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
a
professional
man
,
and
I
beg
to
decline
answer
you

"
  
<EOS>
buffet
in
this
inexcusably
uncivil
way
on
one
cheek
,
the
Count
,
like
a
practical
Christian
,
immediately
turn
the
other
,
and
say
,
in
the
sweetest
manner
,
"
good
-
morning
,
Mr.
Dawson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
my
late
beloved
husband
have
be
so
fortunate
as
to
know
his
lordship
,
how
highly
he
and
the
Count
would
have
esteem
each
other
!
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
the
Countess
return
by
the
last
train
that
night
,
and
bring
with
her
the
nurse
from
London
.
<EOS>
I
be
instruct
that
this
person
's
name
be
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
Her
personal
appearance
,
and
her
imperfect
English
when
she
speak
,
inform
me
that
she
be
a
foreigner
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
always
cultivate
a
feeling
of
humane
indulgence
for
foreigner
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
possess
our
blessing
and
advantage
,
and
they
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
bring
up
in
the
blind
error
of
Popery
.
<EOS>
It
have
also
always
be
my
precept
and
practice
,
as
it
be
my
dear
husband
's
precept
and
practice
before
me
(
see
Sermon
XXIX
.
<EOS>
in
the
Collection
by
the
late
Rev.
Samuel
Michelson
,
M.A.
)
,
to
do
as
I
would
be
do
by
.
<EOS>
on
both
these
account
I
will
not
say
that
Mrs.
Rubelle
strike
me
as
be
a
small
,
wiry
,
sly
person
,
of
fifty
or
thereabout
,
with
a
dark
brown
or
creole
complexion
and
watchful
light
grey
eye
.
<EOS>
nor
will
I
mention
,
for
the
reason
just
allege
,
that
I
think
her
dress
,
though
it
be
of
the
plain
black
silk
,
inappropriately
costly
in
texture
and
unnecessarily
refine
in
trimming
and
finish
,
for
a
person
in
her
position
in
life
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
like
these
thing
to
be
say
of
me
,
and
therefore
it
be
my
duty
not
to
say
them
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
I
will
merely
mention
that
her
manner
be
,
not
perhaps
unpleasantly
reserve
,
but
only
remarkably
quiet
and
retire
 
that
she
look
about
her
a
great
deal
,
and
say
very
little
,
which
may
have
arise
quite
as
much
from
her
own
modesty
as
from
distrust
of
her
position
at
Blackwater
Park
;
and
that
she
decline
to
partake
of
supper
(
which
be
curious
perhaps
,
but
surely
not
suspicious
?
)
,
although
I
myself
politely
invite
her
to
that
meal
in
my
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
Count
's
particular
suggestion
(
so
like
his
lordship
's
forgiving
kindness
!
)
,
it
be
arrange
that
Mrs.
Rubelle
should
not
enter
on
her
duty
until
she
have
be
see
and
approve
by
the
doctor
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
I
sit
up
that
night
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
appear
to
be
very
unwilling
that
the
new
nurse
should
be
employ
to
attend
on
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
such
want
of
liberality
towards
a
foreigner
on
the
part
of
a
lady
of
her
education
and
refinement
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
I
venture
to
say
,
"
My
lady
,
we
must
all
remember
not
to
be
hasty
in
our
judgment
on
our
inferior
 
especially
when
they
come
from
foreign
part
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
do
not
appear
to
attend
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
only
sigh
,
and
kiss
Miss
Halcombe
's
hand
as
it
lie
on
the
counterpane
.
<EOS>
scarcely
a
judicious
proceeding
in
a
sick
-
room
,
with
a
patient
whom
it
be
highly
desirable
not
to
excite
.
<EOS>
but
poor
Lady
Glyde
know
nothing
of
nursing
 
<EOS>
nothing
whatever
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
Mrs.
Rubelle
be
send
to
the
sitting
-
room
,
to
be
approve
by
the
doctor
on
his
way
through
to
the
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
Lady
Glyde
with
Miss
Halcombe
,
who
be
slumber
at
the
time
,
and
join
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
with
the
object
of
kindly
prevent
her
from
feel
strange
and
nervous
in
consequence
of
the
uncertainty
of
her
situation
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
appear
to
see
it
in
that
light
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
be
quite
satisfied
,
beforehand
,
that
Mr.
Dawson
would
approve
of
her
,
and
she
sit
calmly
look
out
of
window
,
with
every
appearance
of
enjoy
the
country
air
.
<EOS>
some
people
may
have
think
such
conduct
suggestive
of
brazen
assurance
.
<EOS>
I
beg
to
say
that
I
more
liberally
set
it
down
to
extraordinary
strength
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
instead
of
the
doctor
come
up
to
us
,
I
be
send
for
to
see
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
I
think
this
change
of
affair
rather
odd
,
but
Mrs.
Rubelle
do
not
appear
to
be
affect
by
it
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
I
leave
her
still
calmly
look
out
of
the
window
,
and
still
silently
enjoy
the
country
air
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
be
wait
for
me
by
himself
in
the

"
about
this
new
nurse
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
that
she
have
be
bring
here
from
London
by
the
wife
of
that
fat
old
foreigner
,
who
be
always
try
to
interfere
with
me
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Michelson
,
the
fat
old
foreigner
be
a
quack
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
rude
.
<EOS>
I
be
naturally
shock
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
aware
,
sir
,
"
I
say
,
"
that
you
be
talk
of
a
nobleman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pooh
!
<EOS>
He
be
not
the
first
quack
with
a
handle
to
his
name
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
Counts
 
<EOS>
hang
'
em
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
not
be
a
friend
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
,
sir
,
if
he
be
not
a
member
of
the
high
aristocracy
 
except
the
english
aristocracy
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
call
him
what
you
like
,
and
let
us
get
back
to
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
object
to
her
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
without
have
see
her
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
without
have
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
the
good
nurse
in
existence
,
but
she
be
not
a
nurse
of
my
providing
.
<EOS>
I
have
put
that
objection
to
Sir
Percival
,
as
the
master
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
support
me
.
<EOS>
He
say
a
nurse
of
my
providing
would
have
be
a
stranger
from
London
also
,
and
he
think
the
woman
ought
to
have
a
trial
,
after
his
wife
's
aunt
have
take
the
trouble
to
fetch
her
from
London
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
justice
in
that
,
and
I
can
not
decently
say
no
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
make
it
a
condition
that
she
be
to
go
at
once
,
if
I
find
reason
to
complain
of
her
.
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
one
which
I
have
some
right
to
make
,
as
medical
attendant
,
Sir
Percival
have
consent
to
it
.
<EOS>
now
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
I
know
I
can
depend
on
you
,
and
I
want
you
to
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
the
nurse
for
the
first
day
or
two
,
and
to
see
that
she
give
Miss
Halcombe
no
medicine
but
mine
.
<EOS>
this
foreign
nobleman
of
yours
be
die
to
try
his
quack
remedy
(
mesmerism
include
)
on
my
patient
,
and
a
nurse
who
be
bring
here
by
his
wife
may
be
a
little
too
willing
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
You
understand
?
<EOS>
very
well
,
then
,
we
may
go
upstairs
.
<EOS>
be
the
nurse
there
?
<EOS>
I
will
say
a
word
to
her
before
she
go
into
the
sick
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
find
Mrs.
Rubelle
still
enjoy
herself
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
when
I
introduce
her
to
Mr.
Dawson
,
neither
the
doctor
's
doubtful
look
nor
the
doctor
's
search
question
appear
to
confuse
her
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
She
answer
him
quietly
in
her
broken
English
,
and
though
he
try
hard
to
puzzle
her
,
she
never
betray
the
least
ignorance
,
so
far
,
about
any
part
of
her
duty
.
<EOS>
this
be
doubtless
the
result
of
strength
of
mind
,
as
I
say
before
,
and
not
of
brazen
assurance
,
by
any
mean
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
go
into
the
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
look
very
attentively
at
the
patient
,
curtsey
to
Lady
Glyde
,
set
one
or
two
little
thing
right
in
the
room
,
and
sit
down
quietly
in
a
corner
to
wait
until
she
be
want
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
seem
startled
and
annoy
by
the
appearance
of
the
strange
nurse
.
<EOS>
no
one
say
anything
,
for
fear
of
rouse
Miss
Halcombe
,
who
be
still
slumber
,
except
the
doctor
,
who
whisper
a
question
about
the
night
.
<EOS>
I
softly
answer
,
"
much
as
usual
,
"
and
then
Mr.
Dawson
go
out
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
follow
him
,
I
suppose
to
speak
about
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
make
up
my
mind
already
that
this
quiet
foreign
person
would
keep
her
situation
.
<EOS>
She
have
all
her
wit
about
her
,
and
she
certainly
understand
her
business
.
<EOS>
so
far
,
I
could
hardly
have
do
much
well
by
the
bedside
myself
.
  
<EOS>
remember
Mr.
Dawson
's
caution
to
me
,
I
subject
Mrs.
Rubelle
to
a
severe
scrutiny
at
certain
interval
for
the
next
three
or
four
day
.
<EOS>
I
over
and
over
again
enter
the
room
softly
and
suddenly
,
but
I
never
find
her
out
in
any
suspicious
action
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
,
who
watch
her
as
attentively
as
I
do
,
discover
nothing
either
.
<EOS>
I
never
detect
a
sign
of
the
medicine
bottle
be
tamper
with
<EOS>
,
I
never
see
Mrs.
Rubelle
say
a
word
to
the
Count
,
or
the
Count
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
manage
Miss
Halcombe
with
unquestionable
care
and
discretion
.
<EOS>
the
poor
lady
waver
backwards
and
forwards
between
a
sort
of
sleepy
exhaustion
,
which
be
half
faintness
and
half
slumbering
,
and
attack
of
fever
which
bring
with
them
more
or
less
of
wander
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
never
disturb
her
in
the
first
case
,
and
never
startle
her
in
the
second
,
by
appear
too
suddenly
at
the
bedside
in
the
character
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
honour
to
whom
honour
be
due
(
whether
foreign
or
English
)
 
<EOS>
and
I
give
her
privilege
impartially
to
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
She
be
remarkably
uncommunicative
about
herself
,
and
she
be
too
quietly
independent
of
all
advice
from
experienced
person
who
understand
the
duty
of
a
sick
-
room
 
<EOS>
but
with
these
drawback
,
she
be
a
good
nurse
,
and
she
never
give
either
Lady
Glyde
or
Mr.
Dawson
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
complaining
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
circumstance
of
importance
that
occur
in
the
house
be
the
temporary
absence
of
the
Count
,
occasion
by
business
which
take
him
to
London
.
<EOS>
He
go
away
(
I
think
)
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
after
the
arrival
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
and
at
part
he
speak
to
Lady
Glyde
very
seriously
,
in
my
presence
,
on
the
subject
of
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Trust
Mr.
Dawson
,
"
he
say
,
"
for
a
few
day
more
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
but
if
there
be
not
some
change
for
the
well
in
that
time
,
send
for
advice
from
London
,
which
this
mule
of
a
doctor
must
accept
in
spite
of
himself
.
<EOS>
offend
Mr.
Dawson
,
and
save
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
I
say
this
seriously
,
on
my
word
of
honour
and
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
speak
with
extreme
feeling
and
kindness
.
<EOS>
but
poor
Lady
Glyde
's
nerve
be
so
completely
break
down
that
she
seem
quite
frightened
at
him
.
<EOS>
She
tremble
from
head
to
foot
,
and
allow
him
to
take
his
leave
without
utter
a
word
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
She
turn
to
me
when
he
have
go
,
and
say
,
"
oh
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
I
be
heartbroken
about
my
sister
,
and
I
have
no
friend
to
advise
me
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
Mr.
Dawson
be
wrong
?
<EOS>
He
tell
me
himself
this
morning
that
there
be
no
fear
,
and
no
need
to
send
for
another
doctor
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
with
all
respect
to
Mr.
Dawson
,
"
I
answer
,
"
in
your
ladyship
's
place
I
should
remember
the
Count
's
advice
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
turn
away
from
me
suddenly
,
with
an
appearance
of
despair
,
for
which
I
be
quite
unable
to
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
his
advice
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
God
help
us
 
his
advice
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
Count
be
away
from
Blackwater
Park
,
as
nearly
as
I
remember
,
a
week
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
seem
to
feel
the
loss
of
his
lordship
in
various
way
,
and
appear
also
,
I
think
,
much
depressed
and
alter
by
the
sickness
and
sorrow
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
occasionally
he
be
so
very
restless
that
I
could
not
help
notice
it
,
come
and
go
,
and
wander
here
and
there
and
everywhere
in
the
ground
.
<EOS>
His
inquiry
about
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
about
his
lady
(
whose
fail
health
seem
to
cause
him
sincere
anxiety
)
,
be
most
attentive
.
<EOS>
I
think
his
heart
be
much
soften
.
<EOS>
if
some
kind
clerical
friend
 
some
such
friend
as
he
may
have
find
in
my
late
excellent
husband
 
have
be
near
him
at
this
time
,
cheer
moral
progress
may
have
be
make
with
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
I
seldom
find
myself
mistaken
on
a
point
of
this
sort
,
have
have
experience
to
guide
me
in
my
happy
married
day
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
the
Countess
,
who
be
now
the
only
company
for
Sir
Percival
downstairs
,
rather
neglect
him
,
as
I
consider
 
or
,
perhaps
,
it
may
have
be
that
he
neglect
her
.
<EOS>
a
stranger
may
almost
have
suppose
that
they
be
bent
,
now
they
be
leave
together
alone
,
on
actually
avoid
one
another
.
<EOS>
this
,
of
course
,
could
not
be
.
<EOS>
but
it
do
so
happen
,
nevertheless
,
that
the
Countess
make
her
dinner
at
luncheon
-
time
,
and
that
she
always
come
upstairs
towards
evening
,
although
Mrs.
Rubelle
have
take
the
nursing
duty
entirely
off
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
dine
by
himself
,
and
William
(
the
man
out
of
livery
)
make
the
remark
,
in
my
hearing
,
that
his
master
have
put
himself
on
half
ration
of
food
and
on
a
double
allowance
of
drink
.
<EOS>
I
attach
no
importance
to
such
an
insolent
observation
as
this
on
the
part
of
a
servant
.
<EOS>
I
reprobate
it
at
the
time
,
and
I
wish
to
be
understand
as
reprobate
it
once
more
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
day
Miss
Halcombe
do
certainly
seem
to
all
of
us
to
be
mend
a
little
.
<EOS>
Our
faith
in
Mr.
Dawson
revive
.
<EOS>
He
appear
to
be
very
confident
about
the
case
,
and
he
assure
Lady
Glyde
,
when
she
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
,
that
he
would
himself
propose
to
send
for
a
physician
the
moment
he
feel
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
cross
his
own
mind
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
person
among
us
who
do
not
appear
to
be
relieve
by
these
word
be
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
She
say
to
me
privately
,
that
she
could
not
feel
easy
about
Miss
Halcombe
on
Mr.
Dawson
's
authority
,
and
that
she
should
wait
anxiously
for
her
husband
's
opinion
on
his
return
.
<EOS>
that
return
,
his
letter
inform
her
,
would
take
place
in
three
day
'
time
.
<EOS>
the
Count
and
Countess
correspond
regularly
every
morning
during
his
lordship
's
absence
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
that
respect
,
as
in
all
other
,
a
pattern
to
married
people
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
I
notice
a
change
in
Miss
Halcombe
,
which
cause
me
serious
apprehension
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
notice
it
too
.
<EOS>
We
say
nothing
on
the
subject
to
Lady
Glyde
,
who
be
then
lie
asleep
,
completely
overpower
by
exhaustion
,
on
the
sofa
in
the
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
do
not
pay
his
evening
visit
till
later
than
usual
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
set
eye
on
his
patient
I
see
his
face
alter
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
hide
it
,
but
he
look
both
confused
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
a
messenger
be
send
to
his
residence
for
his
medicine
-
chest
,
disinfect
preparation
be
use
in
the
room
,
and
a
bed
be
make
up
for
him
in
the
house
by
his
own
direction
.
"
<EOS>
have
the
fever
turn
to
infection
?
<EOS>
"
I
whisper
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
have
,
"
he
answer
;
"
we
shall
know
well
to
-
morrow
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
by
Mr.
Dawson
's
own
direction
Lady
Glyde
be
keep
in
ignorance
of
this
change
for
the
bad
.
<EOS>
He
himself
absolutely
forbid
her
,
on
account
of
her
health
,
to
join
us
in
the
bedroom
that
night
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
resist
 
there
be
a
sad
scene
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
his
medical
authority
to
support
him
,
and
he
carry
his
point
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
one
of
the
man
-
servant
be
send
to
London
at
eleven
o'clock
,
with
a
letter
to
a
physician
in
town
,
and
with
order
to
bring
the
new
doctor
back
with
him
by
the
early
possible
train
.
<EOS>
half
an
hour
after
the
messenger
have
go
the
Count
return
to
Blackwater
Park
.
  
<EOS>
the
Countess
,
on
her
own
responsibility
,
immediately
bring
him
in
to
see
the
patient
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
impropriety
that
I
could
discover
in
her
take
this
course
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
be
a
married
man
,
he
be
old
enough
to
be
Miss
Halcombe
's
father
,
and
he
see
her
in
the
presence
of
a
female
relative
,
Lady
Glyde
's
aunt
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
nevertheless
protest
against
his
presence
in
the
room
,
but
I
could
plainly
remark
the
doctor
be
too
much
alarm
to
make
any
serious
resistance
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
suffering
lady
be
past
know
any
one
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
take
her
friend
for
enemy
.
<EOS>
when
the
Count
approach
her
bedside
<EOS>
her
eye
,
which
have
be
wander
incessantly
round
and
round
the
room
before
,
settle
on
his
face
with
a
dreadful
stare
of
terror
,
which
I
shall
remember
to
my
die
day
.
<EOS>
the
Count
sit
down
by
her
,
feel
her
pulse
and
her
temple
,
look
at
her
very
attentively
,
and
then
turn
round
upon
the
doctor
with
such
an
expression
of
indignation
and
contempt
in
his
face
,
that
the
word
fail
on
Mr.
Dawson
's
lip
,
and
he
stand
for
a
moment
,
pale
with
anger
and
alarm
 
pale
and
perfectly
speechless
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
look
next
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
do
the
change
happen
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
Lady
Glyde
be
in
the
room

"
  
<EOS>
I
reply
that
she
have
not
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
absolutely
forbid
her
to
come
into
the
room
on
the
evening
before
,
and
have
repeat
the
order
again
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
and
Mrs.
Rubelle
be
make
aware
of
the
full
extent
of
the
mischief
?
"
be
his
next
question
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
aware
,
I
answer
,
that
the
malady
be
consider
infectious
.
<EOS>
He
stop
me
before
I
could
add
anything
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
typhus
fever
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
minute
that
pass
,
while
these
question
and
answer
be
go
on
,
Mr.
Dawson
recover
himself
,
and
address
the
Count
with
his
customary
firmness
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
typhus
fever
,
"
he
remark
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
I
protest
against
this
intrusion
,
sir
.
<EOS>
no
one
have
a
right
to
put
question
here
but
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
my
duty
to
the
good
of
my
ability
 
"
  
<EOS>
the
Count
interrupt
him
 
not
by
word
,
but
only
by
point
to
the
bed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
seem
to
feel
that
silent
contradiction
to
his
assertion
of
his
own
ability
,
and
to
grow
only
the
more
angry
under
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
I
have
do
my
duty
,
"
he
reiterate
.
<EOS>
"
a
physician
have
be
send
for
from
London
.
<EOS>
I
will
consult
on
the
nature
of
the
fever
with
him
,
and
with
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
insist
on
your
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
enter
this
room
,
sir
,
in
the
sacred
interest
of
humanity
,
"
say
the
Count
.
"
<EOS>
and
in
the
same
interest
,
if
the
coming
of
the
physician
be
delay
,
I
will
enter
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
warn
you
once
more
that
the
fever
have
turn
to
typhus
,
and
that
your
treatment
be
responsible
for
this
lamentable
change
.
<EOS>
if
that
unhappy
lady
die
,
I
will
give
my
testimony
in
a
court
of
justice
that
your
ignorance
and
obstinacy
have
be
the
cause
of
her
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
before
Mr.
Dawson
could
answer
,
before
the
Count
could
leave
us
,
the
door
be
open
from
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
we
see
Lady
Glyde
on
the
threshold
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
MUST
and
WILL
come
in
,
"
she
say
,
with
extraordinary
firmness
.
  
<EOS>
instead
of
stop
her
,
the
Count
move
into
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
make
way
for
her
to
go
in
.
<EOS>
on
all
other
occasion
he
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
forget
anything
,
but
in
the
surprise
of
the
moment
he
apparently
forget
the
danger
of
infection
from
typhus
,
and
the
urgent
necessity
of
force
Lady
Glyde
to
take
proper
care
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
to
my
astonishment
Mr.
Dawson
show
more
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
He
stop
her
ladyship
at
the
first
step
she
take
towards
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sincerely
sorry
,
I
be
sincerely
grieve
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
the
fever
may
,
I
fear
,
be
infectious
.
<EOS>
until
I
be
certain
that
it
be
not
,
I
entreat
you
to
keep
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
struggle
for
a
moment
,
then
suddenly
drop
her
arm
and
sink
forward
.
<EOS>
She
have
faint
.
<EOS>
the
Countess
and
I
take
her
from
the
doctor
and
carry
her
into
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
the
Count
precede
us
,
and
wait
in
the
passage
till
I
come
out
and
tell
him
that
we
have
recover
her
from
the
swoon
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
back
to
the
doctor
to
tell
him
,
by
Lady
Glyde
's
desire
,
that
she
insist
on
speak
to
him
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
withdraw
at
once
to
quiet
her
ladyship
's
agitation
,
and
to
assure
her
of
the
physician
's
arrival
in
the
course
of
a
few
hour
.
<EOS>
those
hour
pass
very
slowly
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
be
together
downstairs
,
and
send
up
from
time
to
time
to
make
their
inquiry
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
between
five
and
six
o'clock
,
to
our
great
relief
,
the
physician
come
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
man
than
Mr.
Dawson
,
very
serious
and
very
decide
.
<EOS>
what
he
think
of
the
previous
treatment
I
can
not
say
,
but
it
strike
me
as
curious
that
he
put
many
more
question
to
myself
and
to
Mrs.
Rubelle
than
he
put
to
the
doctor
,
and
that
he
do
not
appear
to
listen
with
much
interest
to
what
Mr.
Dawson
say
,
while
he
be
examine
Mr.
Dawson
's
patient
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
suspect
,
from
what
I
observe
in
this
way
,
that
the
Count
have
be
right
about
the
illness
all
the
way
through
,
and
I
be
naturally
confirm
in
that
idea
when
Mr.
Dawson
,
after
some
little
delay
,
ask
the
one
important
question
which
the
London
doctor
have
be
send
for
to
set
at
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
opinion
of
the
fever
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Typhus
,
"
reply
the
physician
"
Typhus
fever
beyond
all
doubt
.
"
  
that
quiet
foreign
person
,
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
cross
her
thin
brown
hand
in
front
of
her
,
and
look
at
me
with
a
very
significant
smile
.
<EOS>
the
Count
himself
could
hardly
have
appear
more
gratified
if
he
have
be
present
in
the
room
and
have
hear
the
confirmation
of
his
own
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
after
give
us
some
useful
direction
about
the
management
of
the
patient
,
and
mention
that
he
would
come
again
in
five
day
'
time
,
the
physician
withdraw
to
consult
in
private
with
Mr.
Dawson
.
<EOS>
He
would
offer
no
opinion
on
Miss
Halcombe
's
chance
of
recovery
 
<EOS>
he
say
it
be
impossible
at
that
stage
of
the
illness
to
pronounce
one
way
or
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
the
five
day
pass
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
Countess
Fosco
and
myself
take
it
by
turn
to
relieve
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
Miss
Halcombe
's
condition
grow
bad
and
bad
,
and
require
our
utmost
care
and
attention
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
terribly
try
time
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
(
support
,
as
Mr.
Dawson
say
,
by
the
constant
strain
of
her
suspense
on
her
sister
's
account
)
rally
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
,
and
show
a
firmness
and
determination
for
which
I
should
myself
never
have
give
her
credit
.
<EOS>
She
insist
on
come
into
the
sick
-
room
two
or
three
time
every
day
,
to
look
at
Miss
Halcombe
with
her
own
eye
,
promise
not
to
go
too
close
to
the
bed
,
if
the
doctor
would
consent
to
her
wish
so
far
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
very
unwillingly
make
the
concession
require
of
him
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
see
that
it
be
hopeless
to
dispute
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
come
in
every
day
,
and
she
self
-
denyingly
keep
her
promise
.
<EOS>
I
feel
it
personally
so
distress
(
as
remind
me
of
my
own
affliction
during
my
husband
's
last
illness
)
to
see
how
she
suffer
under
these
circumstance
,
that
I
must
beg
not
to
dwell
on
this
part
of
the
subject
any
longer
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
agreeable
to
me
to
mention
that
no
fresh
dispute
take
place
between
Mr.
Dawson
and
the
Count
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
make
all
his
inquiry
by
deputy
,
and
remain
continually
in
company
with
Sir
Percival
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
fifth
day
the
physician
come
again
and
give
us
a
little
hope
.
<EOS>
He
say
the
tenth
day
from
the
first
appearance
of
the
typhus
would
probably
decide
the
result
of
the
illness
,
and
he
arrange
for
his
third
visit
to
take
place
on
that
date
.
<EOS>
the
interval
pass
as
before
 
except
that
the
Count
go
to
London
again
one
morning
and
return
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
tenth
day
it
please
a
merciful
Providence
to
relieve
our
household
from
all
further
anxiety
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
the
physician
positively
assure
us
that
Miss
Halcombe
be
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
want
no
doctor
now
 
all
she
require
be
careful
watching
and
nursing
for
some
time
to
come
,
and
that
I
see
she
have
.
<EOS>
"
those
be
his
own
word
.
<EOS>
that
evening
I
read
my
husband
's
touch
sermon
on
Recovery
from
Sickness
,
with
more
happiness
and
advantage
(
in
a
spiritual
point
of
view
)
than
I
ever
remember
to
have
derive
from
it
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
effect
of
the
good
news
on
poor
Lady
Glyde
be
,
I
grieve
to
say
,
quite
overpowering
.
<EOS>
She
be
too
weak
to
bear
the
violent
reaction
,
and
in
another
day
or
two
she
sink
into
a
state
of
debility
and
depression
which
oblige
her
to
keep
her
room
.
<EOS>
rest
and
quiet
,
and
change
of
air
afterwards
,
be
the
good
remedy
which
Mr.
Dawson
could
suggest
for
her
benefit
.
<EOS>
It
be
fortunate
that
matter
be
no
bad
,
for
,
on
the
very
day
after
she
take
to
her
room
,
the
Count
and
the
doctor
have
another
disagreement
 
and
this
time
the
dispute
between
them
be
of
so
serious
a
nature
that
Mr.
Dawson
leave
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
present
at
the
time
,
but
I
understand
that
the
subject
of
dispute
be
the
amount
of
nourishment
which
it
be
necessary
to
give
to
assist
Miss
Halcombe
's
convalescence
after
the
exhaustion
of
the
fever
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
,
now
that
his
patient
be
safe
,
be
less
inclined
than
ever
to
submit
to
unprofessional
interference
,
and
the
Count
(
I
can
not
imagine
why
)
lose
all
the
self
-
control
which
he
have
so
judiciously
preserve
on
former
occasion
,
and
taunt
the
doctor
,
over
and
over
again
,
with
his
mistake
about
the
fever
when
it
change
to
typhus
.
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
affair
end
in
Mr.
Dawson
's
appeal
to
Sir
Percival
,
and
threaten
(
now
that
he
could
leave
without
absolute
danger
to
Miss
Halcombe
)
to
withdraw
from
his
attendance
at
Blackwater
Park
if
the
Count
's
interference
be
not
peremptorily
suppress
from
that
moment
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
reply
(
though
not
designedly
uncivil
)
have
only
result
in
make
matter
bad
,
and
Mr.
Dawson
have
thereupon
withdraw
from
the
house
in
a
state
of
extreme
indignation
at
Count
Fosco
's
usage
of
him
,
and
have
send
in
his
bill
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
,
therefore
,
leave
without
the
attendance
of
a
medical
man
.
<EOS>
although
there
be
no
actual
necessity
for
another
doctor
 
nursing
and
watch
be
,
as
the
physician
have
observe
,
all
that
Miss
Halcombe
require
 
I
should
still
,
if
my
authority
have
be
consult
,
have
obtain
professional
assistance
from
some
other
quarter
,
for
form
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
the
matter
do
not
seem
to
strike
Sir
Percival
in
that
light
.
<EOS>
He
say
it
would
be
time
enough
to
send
for
another
doctor
if
Miss
Halcombe
show
any
sign
of
a
relapse
.
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
we
have
the
Count
to
consult
in
any
minor
difficulty
,
and
we
need
not
unnecessarily
disturb
our
patient
in
her
present
weak
and
nervous
condition
by
the
presence
of
a
stranger
at
her
bedside
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
that
be
reasonable
,
no
doubt
,
in
these
consideration
,
but
they
leave
me
a
little
anxious
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
nor
be
I
quite
satisfied
in
my
own
mind
of
the
propriety
of
our
conceal
the
doctor
's
absence
as
we
do
from
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
merciful
deception
,
I
admit
 
for
she
be
in
no
state
to
bear
any
fresh
anxiety
.
<EOS>
but
still
it
be
a
deception
,
and
,
as
such
,
to
a
person
of
my
principle
,
at
best
a
doubtful
proceeding
.
  
<EOS>
a
second
perplexing
circumstance
which
happen
on
the
same
day
,
and
which
take
me
completely
by
surprise
,
add
greatly
to
the
sense
of
uneasiness
that
be
now
weigh
on
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
send
for
to
see
Sir
Percival
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
the
Count
,
who
be
with
him
when
I
go
in
,
immediately
rise
and
leave
us
alone
together
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
civilly
ask
me
to
take
a
seat
,
and
then
,
to
my
great
astonishment
,
address
me
in
these
term
    
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
about
a
matter
which
I
decide
on
some
time
ago
,
and
which
I
should
have
mention
before
,
but
for
the
sickness
and
trouble
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
in
plain
word
,
I
have
reason
for
wish
to
break
up
my
establishment
immediately
at
this
place
 
leave
you
in
charge
,
of
course
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Lady
Glyde
and
Miss
Halcombe
can
travel
they
must
both
have
change
of
air
.
<EOS>
My
friend
,
Count
Fosco
and
the
Countess
,
will
leave
us
before
that
time
to
live
in
the
neighbourhood
of
London
,
and
I
have
reason
for
not
open
the
house
to
any
more
company
,
with
a
view
to
economise
as
carefully
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
blame
you
,
but
my
expense
here
be
a
great
deal
too
heavy
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
shall
sell
the
horse
,
and
get
rid
of
all
the
servant
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
never
do
thing
by
half
,
as
you
know
,
and
I
mean
to
have
the
house
clear
of
a
pack
of
useless
people
by
this
time
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
listen
to
him
,
perfectly
aghast
with
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
,
Sir
Percival
,
that
I
be
to
dismiss
the
indoor
servant
under
my
charge
without
the
usual
month
's
warning
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
I
do
.
<EOS>
We
may
all
be
out
of
the
house
before
another
month
,
and
I
be
not
go
to
leave
the
servant
here
in
idleness

with
no
master
to
wait
on

who
be
to
do
the
cooking

Sir
Percival

Margaret
Porcher

My
weekly
expense

shall
be
lower
immediately

<EOS>
I
do
not
send
for
you
to
make
objection
,
Mrs.
Michelson
 
I
send
for
you
to
carry
out
my
plan
of
economy

<EOS>
dismiss
the
whole
lazy
pack
of
indoor
servant
to
-
morrow
,
except
Porcher
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
strong
as
a
horse
 
<EOS>
and
we
will
make
her
work
like
a
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
excuse
me
for
remind
you
,
Sir
Percival
,
that
if
the
servant
go
to
-
morrow
they
must
have
a
month
's
wage
in
lieu
of
a
month
's
warning

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
them
!
<EOS>
a
month
's
wage
save
a
month
's
waste
and
gluttony
in
the
servant
'
hall
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
last
remark
convey
an
aspersion
of
the
most
offensive
kind
on
my
management
.
<EOS>
I
have
too
much
self
-
respect
to
defend
myself
under
so
gross
an
imputation
.
<EOS>
christian
consideration
for
the
helpless
position
of
Miss
Halcombe
and
Lady
Glyde
,
and
for
the
serious
inconvenience
which
my
sudden
absence
may
inflict
on
them
,
alone
prevent
me
from
resign
my
situation
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
rise
immediately
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
lower
me
in
my
own
estimation
to
have
permit
the
interview
to
continue
a
moment
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
that
last
remark
,
Sir
Percival
,
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
Your
direction
shall
be
attend
to
.
<EOS>
"
pronounce
those
word
,
I
bow
my
head
with
the
most
distant
respect
,
and
go
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
the
servant
leave
in
a
body
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
himself
dismiss
the
groom
and
stableman
,
send
them
,
with
all
the
horse
but
one
,
to
London
.
<EOS>
of
the
whole
domestic
establishment
,
indoor
and
out
,
there
now
remain
only
myself
,
Margaret
Porcher
,
and
the
gardener
 
<EOS>
this
last
living
in
his
own
cottage
,
and
be
want
to
take
care
of
the
one
horse
that
remain
in
the
stable
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
house
leave
in
this
strange
and
lonely
condition
 
with
the
mistress
of
it
ill
in
her
room
 
with
Miss
Halcombe
still
as
helpless
as
a
child
 
and
with
the
doctor
's
attendance
withdraw
from
us
in
enmity
 
<EOS>
it
be
surely
not
unnatural
that
my
spirit
should
sink
,
and
my
customary
composure
be
very
hard
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
My
mind
be
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
I
wish
the
poor
lady
both
well
again
,
and
I
wish
myself
away
from
Blackwater
Park
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
event
that
occur
be
of
so
singular
a
nature
that
it
may
have
cause
me
a
feeling
of
superstitious
surprise
,
if
my
mind
have
not
be
fortify
by
principle
against
any
pagan
weakness
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
the
uneasy
sense
of
something
wrong
in
the
family
which
have
make
me
wish
myself
away
from
Blackwater
Park
,
be
actually
follow
,
strange
to
say
,
by
my
departure
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
my
absence
be
for
a
temporary
period
only
,
but
the
coincidence
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
not
the
less
remarkable
on
that
account
.
  
<EOS>
My
departure
take
place
under
the
follow
circumstance
    
a
day
or
two
after
the
servant
all
leave
I
be
again
send
for
to
see
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
the
undeserved
slur
which
he
have
cast
on
my
management
of
the
household
do
not
,
I
be
happy
to
say
,
prevent
me
from
return
good
for
evil
to
the
good
of
my
ability
,
by
comply
with
his
request
as
readily
and
respectfully
as
ever
.
<EOS>
It
cost
me
a
struggle
with
that
fall
nature
,
which
we
all
share
in
common
,
before
I
could
suppress
my
feeling
.
<EOS>
be
accustomed
to
self
-
discipline
,
I
accomplish
the
sacrifice
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
Sir
Percival
and
Count
Fosco
sit
together
again
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
his
lordship
remain
present
at
the
interview
,
and
assist
in
the
development
of
Sir
Percival
's
view
.
  
<EOS>
the
subject
to
which
they
now
request
my
attention
relate
to
the
healthy
change
of
air
by
which
we
all
hope
that
Miss
Halcombe
and
Lady
Glyde
may
soon
be
enable
to
profit
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
mention
that
both
the
lady
would
probably
pass
the
autumn
(
by
invitation
of
Frederick
Fairlie
,
Esquire
)
at
Limmeridge
House
,
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
but
before
they
go
there
,
it
be
his
opinion
,
confirm
by
Count
Fosco
(
who
here
take
up
the
conversation
and
continue
it
to
the
end
)
,
that
they
would
benefit
by
a
short
residence
first
in
the
genial
climate
of
Torquay
.
<EOS>
the
great
object
,
therefore
,
be
to
engage
lodging
at
that
place
,
afford
all
the
comfort
and
advantage
of
which
they
stand
in
need
,
and
the
great
difficulty
be
to
find
an
experienced
person
capable
of
choose
the
sort
of
residence
which
they
want
.
<EOS>
in
this
emergency
the
Count
beg
to
inquire
,
on
Sir
Percival
's
behalf
,
whether
I
would
object
to
give
the
lady
the
benefit
of
my
assistance
,
by
proceed
myself
to
Torquay
in
their
interest
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
a
person
in
my
situation
to
meet
any
proposal
,
make
in
these
term
,
with
a
positive
objection
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
only
venture
to
represent
the
serious
inconvenience
of
my
leave
Blackwater
Park
in
the
extraordinary
absence
of
all
the
indoor
servant
,
with
the
one
exception
of
Margaret
Porcher
.
<EOS>
but
Sir
Percival
and
his
lordship
declare
that
they
be
both
willing
to
put
up
with
inconvenience
for
the
sake
of
the
invalid
.
<EOS>
I
next
respectfully
suggest
write
to
an
agent
at
Torquay
,
but
I
be
meet
here
by
be
remind
of
the
imprudence
of
take
lodging
without
first
see
them
.
<EOS>
I
be
also
inform
that
the
Countess
(
who
would
otherwise
have
go
to
devonshire
herself
)
could
not
,
in
Lady
Glyde
's
present
condition
,
leave
her
niece
,
and
that
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
have
business
to
transact
together
which
would
oblige
them
to
remain
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
be
clearly
show
me
that
if
I
do
not
undertake
the
errand
,
no
one
else
could
be
trust
with
it
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
I
could
only
inform
Sir
Percival
that
my
service
be
at
the
disposal
of
Miss
Halcombe
and
Lady
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
thereupon
arrange
that
I
should
leave
the
next
morning
,
that
I
should
occupy
one
or
two
day
in
examine
all
the
most
convenient
house
in
Torquay
,
and
that
I
should
return
with
my
report
as
soon
as
I
conveniently
could
.
<EOS>
a
memorandum
be
write
for
me
by
his
lordship
,
state
the
requisite
which
the
place
I
be
send
to
take
must
be
find
to
possess
,
and
a
note
of
the
pecuniary
limit
assign
to
me
be
add
by
Sir
Percival
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
idea
on
read
over
these
instruction
be
,
that
no
such
residence
as
I
see
describe
could
be
find
at
any
watering
-
place
in
England
,
and
that
,
even
if
it
could
by
chance
be
discover
,
it
would
certainly
not
be
part
with
for
any
period
on
such
term
as
I
be
permit
to
offer
.
<EOS>
I
hint
at
these
difficulty
to
both
the
gentleman
,
but
Sir
Percival
(
who
undertake
to
answer
me
)
do
not
appear
to
feel
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
me
to
dispute
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
say
no
more
,
but
I
feel
a
very
strong
conviction
that
the
business
on
which
I
be
send
away
be
so
beset
by
difficulty
that
my
errand
be
almost
hopeless
at
starting
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
leave
I
take
care
to
satisfy
myself
that
Miss
Halcombe
be
go
on
favourably
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
painful
expression
of
anxiety
in
her
face
which
make
me
fear
that
her
mind
,
on
first
recover
itself
,
be
not
at
ease
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
certainly
strengthen
more
rapidly
than
I
could
have
venture
to
anticipate
,
and
she
be
able
to
send
kind
message
to
Lady
Glyde
,
say
that
she
be
fast
get
well
,
and
entreat
her
ladyship
not
to
exert
herself
again
too
soon
.
<EOS>
I
leave
her
in
charge
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
who
be
still
as
quietly
independent
of
every
one
else
in
the
house
as
ever
.
<EOS>
when
I
knock
at
Lady
Glyde
's
door
before
go
away
,
I
be
tell
that
she
be
still
sadly
weak
and
depressed
,
my
informant
be
the
Countess
,
who
be
then
keep
her
company
in
her
room
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
be
walk
on
the
road
to
the
lodge
as
I
be
drive
by
in
the
chaise
.
<EOS>
I
bow
to
them
and
quit
the
house
,
with
not
a
live
soul
leave
in
the
servant
'
office
but
Margaret
Porcher
.
  
<EOS>
every
one
must
feel
what
I
have
feel
myself
since
that
time
,
that
these
circumstance
be
more
than
unusual
 
<EOS>
they
be
!
<EOS>
almost
suspicious
.
<EOS>
let
me
,
however
,
say
again
that
it
be
impossible
for
me
,
in
my
dependent
position
,
to
act
otherwise
than
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
result
of
my
errand
at
Torquay
be
exactly
what
I
have
foresee
.
<EOS>
no
such
lodging
as
I
be
instruct
to
take
could
be
find
in
the
whole
place
,
and
the
term
I
be
permit
to
give
be
much
too
low
for
the
purpose
,
even
if
I
have
be
able
to
discover
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
return
to
Blackwater
Park
,
and
inform
Sir
Percival
,
who
meet
me
at
the
door
,
that
my
journey
have
be
take
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
seem
too
much
occupy
with
some
other
subject
to
care
about
the
failure
of
my
errand
,
and
his
first
word
inform
me
that
even
in
the
short
time
of
my
absence
another
remarkable
change
have
take
place
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
Count
and
Countess
Fosco
have
leave
Blackwater
Park
for
their
new
residence
in
St.
John
's
Wood
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
make
aware
of
the
motive
for
this
sudden
departure
 
<EOS>
I
be
only
tell
that
the
Count
have
be
very
particular
in
leave
his
kind
compliment
to
me
.
<EOS>
when
I
venture
on
ask
Sir
Percival
whether
Lady
Glyde
have
any
one
to
attend
to
her
comfort
in
the
absence
of
the
Countess
,
he
reply
that
she
have
Margaret
Porcher
to
wait
on
her
,
and
he
add
that
a
woman
from
the
village
have
be
send
for
to
do
the
work
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
the
answer
really
shock
me
 
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
glaring
impropriety
in
permit
an
under
-
housemaid
to
fill
the
place
of
confidential
attendant
on
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
I
go
upstairs
at
once
,
and
meet
Margaret
on
the
bedroom
landing
.
<EOS>
Her
service
have
not
be
require
(
naturally
enough
)
,
her
mistress
have
sufficiently
recover
that
morning
to
be
able
to
leave
her
bed
.
<EOS>
I
ask
next
after
Miss
Halcombe
,
but
I
be
answer
in
a
slouching
,
sulky
way
,
which
leave
me
no
wise
than
I
be
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
choose
to
repeat
the
question
,
and
perhaps
provoke
an
impertinent
reply
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
every
respect
more
become
to
a
person
in
my
position
to
present
myself
immediately
in
Lady
Glyde
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
that
her
ladyship
have
certainly
gain
in
health
during
the
last
few
day
.
<EOS>
although
still
sadly
weak
and
nervous
,
she
be
able
to
get
up
without
assistance
,
and
to
walk
slowly
about
her
room
,
feel
no
bad
effect
from
the
exertion
than
a
slight
sensation
of
fatigue
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
make
a
little
anxious
that
morning
about
Miss
Halcombe
,
through
have
receive
no
news
of
her
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
think
this
seem
to
imply
a
blamable
want
of
attention
on
the
part
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
but
I
say
nothing
,
and
remain
with
Lady
Glyde
to
assist
her
to
dress
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
ready
we
both
leave
the
room
together
to
go
to
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
stop
in
the
passage
by
the
appearance
of
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
He
look
as
if
he
have
be
purposely
wait
there
to
see
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
to
Lady
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
Marian
's
room
,
"
she
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
spare
you
a
disappointment
,
"
remark
Sir
Percival
,
"
if
I
tell
you
at
once
that
you
will
not
find
her
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
find
her
there
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
She
leave
the
house
yesterday
morning
with
Fosco
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
be
not
strong
enough
to
bear
the
surprise
of
this
extraordinary
statement
.
<EOS>
She
turn
fearfully
pale
,
and
lean
back
against
the
wall
,
look
at
her
husband
in
dead
silence
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
astonished
myself
that
I
hardly
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
ask
Sir
Percival
if
he
really
mean
that
Miss
Halcombe
have
leave
Blackwater
Park
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
mean
it
,
"
he
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
her
state
,
Sir
Percival
!
<EOS>
without
mention
her
intention
to
Lady
Glyde
!
"
  
<EOS>
before
he
could
reply
her
ladyship
recover
herself
a
little
and
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
impossible
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
out
in
a
loud
,
frightened
manner
,
take
a
step
or
two
forward
from
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
the
doctor
?
<EOS>
where
be
Mr.
Dawson
when
Marian
go
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Dawson
be
not
want
,
and
be
not
here
,
"
say
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
leave
of
his
own
accord
,
which
be
enough
of
itself
to
show
that
she
be
strong
enough
to
travel
.
<EOS>
how
you
stare
!
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
believe
she
have
go
,
look
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
open
her
room
door
,
and
all
the
other
room
door
if
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
take
him
at
his
word
,
and
I
follow
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
in
Miss
Halcombe
's
room
but
Margaret
Porcher
,
who
be
busy
set
it
to
right
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
in
the
spare
room
or
the
dressing
-
room
when
we
look
into
them
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
still
wait
for
us
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
as
we
be
leave
the
last
room
that
we
have
examine
Lady

<EOS>
He
leave
us
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
His
manner
all
through
this
strange
conversation
have
be
very
unlike
what
it
usually
be
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
almost
as
nervous
and
fluttered
,
every
now
and
then
,
as
his
lady
herself
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
suppose
that
his
health
have
be
so
delicate
,
or
his
composure
so
easy
to
upset
.
  
<EOS>
I
try
to
prevail
on
Lady
Glyde
to
go
back
to
her
room
,
but
it
be
useless
.
<EOS>
She
stop
in
the
passage
,
with
the
look
of
a
woman
whose
mind
be
panic
-
stricken
.
  
<EOS>
"
something
have
happen
to
my

<EOS>
she

.
  
<EOS>
"
remember
,
my
lady

what
surprising
energy
there
be
in
Miss
Halcombe

I
suggest
.
<EOS>
"
She
may
well
make
an
effort
which
other
lady
in
her
situation
would
be
unfit

I
hope
and
believe
there
be
nothing
wrong

I
do
indeed

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
follow
Marian

say
her

,
with
the
same
panic
-
stricken
look
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
where
she
have
go

I
must
see
that
she

alive

well

down
with

<EOS>
I
hesitate

fear
that
my

may
be
consider
an
intrusion
.
<EOS>
I
attempt
to
represent
this
to
her
ladyship
,
but
she
be
deaf
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
hold
my
arm
fast
enough
to
force
me
to
go
downstairs
with
her
,
and
she
still
cling
to
me
with
all
the
little
strength
she
have
at
the
moment
when
I
open
the
dining
-
room
door
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
be
sit
at
the
table
with
a
decanter
of
wine
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
raise
the
glass
to
his
lip
as
we
go
in
and
drain
it
at
a
draught
.
<EOS>
see
that
he
look
at
me
angrily
when
he
put
it
down
again
,
I
attempt
to
make
some
apology
for
my
accidental
presence
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
suppose
there
be
any
secret
go
on
here
?
<EOS>
"
he
break
out
suddenly
;
"
there
be
none
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
underhand
,
nothing
keep
from
you
or
from
any
one

"
<EOS>
after
speak
those
strange
word
loudly
and
sternly
,
he
fill
himself
another
glass
of
wine
and
ask
Lady
Glyde
what
she
want
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
my
sister
be
fit

travel
<EOS>
I

say
her
ladyship
,
with
more
firmness
than
she
have
yet
show
.
<EOS>
"
I
come
to
beg
you
will
make
allowance
for
my
anxiety
about
Marian
,

let
me
follow
her
at
once
by
the
afternoon
train

<EOS>
"
You
must
wait
till

morrow

reply
Sir
Percival
,
"
and
then
if
you
do
not
hear
to
the
contrary
you
can
go

<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
you
be
at
all
likely

hear
to
the
contrary

so
I
shall
write
to
Fosco
by
to

night
's
post

<EOS>
He
say
those
last
word
hold
his
glass
up
to
the
light
,
and
look
at
the
wine
in
it
instead
of
at
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
indeed
he
never
once
look
at
her
throughout
the
conversation

<EOS>
such
a
singular
want
of
good
breeding
in
a
gentleman
of
his
rank
impress
me
<EOS>
,
I
own
,
very
painfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
write
to
count
Fosco

she
ask
,
in
extreme
surprise

Lady
Glyde

hand
begin
to
tremble
violently
round
my
arm

why
I
could
not
imagine

<EOS>
"
there
be
no
necessity

faintly

It
be
a
note

short

careless

out
eagerly
with

word

quite
do
read

short

Sir

fill
another
glass
from

decanter
so
awkwardly

upset

spill
all

slowly
set

up
again

refill
it
,
and
drain
it
once
more
at
a
draught

Sir

with
a
sudden
burst

anger

startle
us
both

<EOS>
the
arrangement
propose

so
unquestionably
the
right

the
proper
one

that
I
could
make
no
possible
objection
to
it

<EOS>
much
as
I
sympathise
with
Lady
Glyde
in
other
respect

I
could
not
sympathise

her
unjust
prejudice

I
never

rank

station
who

so
lamentably
narrow

minded

neither
her
uncle

note

Sir

increase
impatience

effect

start
to
his
foot
,
and
suddenly
walk
out
into
the
verandah
through
the
open
glass
door

your

whisper

<EOS>
She
consent
to
leave
the
room
in
a
weary
,
absent
manner

<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
be
safe
upstairs
again
,
I
do
all
I
could
to
compose
her
ladyship
's
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
remind
her
that
Mr.
Fairlie
's
letter
to
Miss
Halcombe
and
to
herself
do
certainly
sanction
,
and
even
render
necessary
,
sooner
or
later
,
the
course
that
have
be
take
.
<EOS>
She
agree
to
this
,
and
even
admit
,
of
her
own
accord
,
that
both
letter
be
strictly
in
character
with
her
uncle
's
peculiar
disposition
 
but
her
fear
about
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
her
unaccountable
dread
of
sleep
at
the
Count
's
house
in
London
,
still
remain
unshaken
in
spite
of
every
consideration
that
I
could
urge
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
my
duty
to
protest
against
Lady
Glyde
's
unfavourable
opinion
of
his
lordship
,
and
I
do
so
,
with
become
forbearance
and
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
will
pardon
my
freedom

I
remark
,
in
conclusion

it
be

sure

merit
our

<EOS>
even
his

serious
misunderstanding

entirely
attributable

what
misunderstanding

inquire
her

with
a
look

sudden

I
relate
the
unhappy
circumstance

which
Mr.
Dawson
have
withdraw
his
attendance
 
mention
them
all
the
more
readily

I
disapprove

Lady
Glyde

<EOS>
Her
ladyship
start
up
,
with
every
appearance
of
be
additionally
agitate
and
alarm
by
what
I
have
tell
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
bad
!
<EOS>
bad
than
I
think
!
<EOS>
"
she
say
,
walk
about
the
room
,
in
a
bewildered
manner
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Count
know
Mr.
Dawson
would
never
consent
to
Marian
's
take
a
journey
 
he
purposely
insult
the
doctor
to
get
him
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
lady
!
<EOS>
my
lady
!
<EOS>
"
I
remonstrate

<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Michelson
!
<EOS>
"
she
go
on
vehemently
,
"
no
word
that
ever
be
speak
will
persuade
me
that
my
sister
be
in
that
man
's
power
and
in
that
man
's
house
with
her
own
consent
.
<EOS>
My
horror
of
him
be
such
,
that
nothing
Sir
Percival
could
say
and
no
letter
my
uncle
could
write
,
would
induce
me
,
if
I
have
only
my
own
feeling
to
consult
,
to
eat
,
drink
,
or
sleep
under
his
roof
.
<EOS>
but
my
misery
of
suspense
about
Marian
give
me
the
courage
to
follow
her
anywhere
,
to
follow
her
even
into
Count
Fosco
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
right
,
at
this
point
,
to
mention
that
Miss
Halcombe
have
already
go
on
to
Cumberland
,
accord
to
Sir
Percival
's
account
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
to
believe
it
!
"
answer
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
she
be
still
in
that
man
's
house
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
wrong
,
if
she
have
really
go
on
to
Limmeridge
,
I
be
resolve
I
will
not
sleep
to
-
morrow
night
under
Count
Fosco
's
roof
.
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
in
the
world
,
next
to
my
sister
,
live
near
London
.
<EOS>
You
have
hear
me
,
you
have
hear
Miss
Halcombe
,
speak
of
Mrs.
Vesey
?
<EOS>
I
mean
to
write
,
and
propose
to
sleep
at
her
house
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
I
shall
get
there
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
I
shall
avoid
the
Count
 
<EOS>
but
to
that
refuge
I
will
escape
in
some
way
,
if
my
sister
have
go
to
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
all
I
ask
of
you
to
do
,
be
to
see
yourself
that
my
letter
to
Mrs.
Vesey
go
to
London
to
-
night
,
as
certainly
as
Sir
Percival
's
letter
go
to
Count
Fosco
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
for
not
trust
the
post
-
bag
downstairs
.
<EOS>
Will
you
keep
my
secret
,
and
help
me
in
this
?
<EOS>
it
be
the
last
favour
,
perhaps
,
that
I
shall
ever
ask
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hesitate
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
all
very
strange
,
I
almost
fear
that
her
ladyship
's
mind
have
be
a
little
affect
by
recent
anxiety
and
suffering
.
<EOS>
at
my
own
risk
,
however
,
I
end
by
give
my
consent
.
<EOS>
if
the
letter
have
be
address
to
a
stranger
,
or
to
any
one
but
a
lady
so
well
known
to
me
by
report
as
Mrs.
Vesey
,
I
may
have
refuse
.
<EOS>
I
thank
God
 
look
to
what
happen
afterwards
 
<EOS>
I
thank
God
<EOS>
I
never
thwart
that
wish
,
or
any
other
,
which
Lady
Glyde
express
to
me
,
on
the
last
day
of
her
residence
at
Blackwater
Park
.
  
<EOS>
the
letter
be
write
and
give
into
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
myself
put
it
into
the
post
-
box
in
the
village
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
We
see
nothing
more
of
Sir
Percival
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
sleep
,
by
Lady
Glyde
's
own
desire
,
in
the
next
room
to
her
,
with
the
door
open
between
us
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
strange
and
dreadful
in
the
loneliness
and
emptiness
of
the
house
,
that
I
be
glad
,
on
my
side
,
to
have
a
companion
near
me
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
sit
up
late
,
read
letter
and
burn
them
,
and
empty
her
drawer
and
cabinet
of
little
thing
she
prize
,
as
if
she
never
expect
to
return
to
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
Her
sleep
be
sadly
disturb
when
she
at
last
go
to
bed
 
<EOS>
she
cry
out
in
it
several
time
,
once
so
loud
that
she
wake
herself
.
<EOS>
whatever
her
dream
be
,
she
do
not
think
fit
to
communicate
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
in
my
situation
,
I
have
no
right
to
expect
that
she
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
matter
little
now
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
her
,
I
be
indeed
heartily
sorry
for
her
all
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
be
fine
and
sunny
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
come
up
,
after
breakfast
,
to
tell
us
that
the
chaise
would
be
at
the
door
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
 
<EOS>
the
train
to
London
stop
at
our
station
at
twenty
minute
after
.
<EOS>
He
inform
Lady
Glyde
that
he
be
oblige
to
go
out
,
but
add
that
he
hope
to
be
back
before
she
leave
.
<EOS>
if
any
unforeseen
accident
delay
him
,
I
be
to
accompany
her
to
the
station
,
and
to
take
special
care
that
she
be
in
time
for
the
train
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
communicate
these
direction
very
hastily
 
walk
here
<EOS>
and
there
about
the
room
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
look
attentively
after
him
wherever
he
go
.
<EOS>
He
never
once
look
at
her
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
She
only
speak
when
he
have
do
,
and
then
she
stop
him
as
he
approach
the
door
,
by
hold
out
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
see
you
no
more
,
"
she
say
,
in
a
very
marked
manner
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
our
parting
 
our
parting
,
it
may
be
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Will
you
try
to
forgive
me
,
Percival
,
as
heartily
as
I
forgive
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
His
face
turn
of
an
awful
whiteness
all
over
,
and
great
bead
of
perspiration
break
out
on
his
bald
forehead
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
back
,
"
he
say
,
and
make
for
the
door
,
as
hastily
as
if
his
wife
's
farewell
word
have
frighten
him
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
never
like
Sir
Percival
,
but
the
manner
in
which
he
leave
Lady
Glyde
make
me
feel
ashamed
of
have
eat
his
bread
and
live
in
his
service
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
say
a
few
comforting
and
christian
word
to
the
poor
lady
,
but
there
be
something
in
her
face
,
as
she
look
after
her
husband
when
the
door
close
on
him
,
that
make
me
alter
my
mind
and
keep
silence
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
time
name
the
chaise
draw
up
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
be
right
 
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
never
come
back
.
<EOS>
I
wait
for
him
till
the
last
moment
,
and
wait
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
no
positive
responsibility
lie
on
my
shoulder
,
and
yet
I
do
not
feel
easy
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
of
your
own
free
will
,
"
I
say
,
as
the
chaise
drive
through
the
lodge
-
gate
,
"
that
your
ladyship
go
to
London
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
anywhere
,
"
she
answer
,
"
to
end
the
dreadful
suspense
that
I
be
suffer
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
make
me
feel
almost
as
anxious
and
as
uncertain
about
Miss
Halcombe
as
she
feel
herself
.
<EOS>
I
presume
to
ask
her
to
write
me
a
line
,
if
all
go
well
in
London
.
<EOS>
She
answer
,
"
most
willingly
,
Mrs.
Michelson
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
have
our
crosse
to
bear
,
my
lady
,
"
I
say
,
see
her
silent
and
thoughtful
,
after
she
have
promise
to
write
.
  
<EOS>
She
make
no
reply
 
<EOS>
she
seem
to
be
too
much
wrap
up
in
her
own
thought
to
attend
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
your
ladyship
rest
badly
last
night
,
"
I
remark
,
after
wait
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

"
she
say
,
"
I
be
terribly

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
I
think
she
be
go
to
tell
me
her
dream
,
but
no
,
when
she
speak
next
it
be
only
to
ask
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

the
letter
to
Mrs.
Vesey
with
your
own
hand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

"
He

my
lady

"
  
<EOS>
She
sigh
heavily
when
I
answer
that
last
question
,
and
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
We
arrive
at
the
station
,
with
hardly
two
minute
to
spare
.
<EOS>
the
gardener
(
who
have
drive

about
the
luggage
,
while
I
take

ticket
.
<EOS>
the
whistle
of
the
train
be
sound
when
I
join
her
ladyship
on
the
platform

<EOS>
She
look
very
strangely
,
and
press
her
hand
over
her
heart
,
as
if
some
sudden
pain
or
fright
have
overcome
her
at
that
moment

<EOS>
if
there

be
time
,
if
I
have
feel
the
day
before
as
I
feel
then
,
I
would

<EOS>
as

express
at
the
last
moment
only

be
express
too
late
for

<EOS>
She
seem
to
understand
this
herself
before
I
could
explain
it
,
and
do
not
repeat
her
desire
to
have
me
for
a
travel
companion

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
She

"
You

She

She
shake

in

the

Her

for
the
last
time
 
look
sorrowfully
and
solemnly
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
She
wave
her
hand
,
and
I
see
her
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
towards
five
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
of
that
same
day
,
have
a
little
time
to
myself
in
the
midst
of
the
household
duty
which
now
press
upon
me
,
I
sit
down
alone
in
my
own
room
,
to
try
and
compose
my
mind
with
the
volume
of
my
husband
's
Sermons
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
find
my
attention
wander
over
those
pious
and
cheer
word
.
<EOS>
conclude
that
Lady
Glyde
's
departure
must
have
disturb
me
far
more
seriously
than
I
have
myself
suppose
,
I
put
the
book
aside
,
and
go
out
to
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
not
yet
return
,
to
my
knowledge
,
so
I
could
feel
no
hesitation
about
show
myself
in
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
on
turn
the
corner
of
the
house
,
and
gain
a
view
of
the
garden
,
I
be
startle
by
see
a
stranger
walk
in
it
.
<EOS>
the
stranger
be
a
woman
 
<EOS>
she
be
lounge
along
the
path
with
her
back
to
me
,
and
be
gather
the
flower
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
approach
she
hear
me
,
and
turn
round
.
  
<EOS>
My
blood
curdle
in
my
vein
.
<EOS>
the
strange
woman
in
the
garden
be
Mrs.
Rubelle
!
  
<EOS>
I
could
neither
move
nor
speak
.
<EOS>
She
come
up
to
me
,
as
composedly
as
ever
,
with
her
flower
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
madam
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
here
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasp
out
.
"
<EOS>
not
go
to
London
!
<EOS>
not
go
to
Cumberland
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
smell
at
her
flower
with
a
smile
of
malicious
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
not
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
leave
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
summon
breath
enough
and
courage
enough
for
another
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
fairly
laugh
at
me
this
time
,
and
reply
in
these
word
    
"
Miss
Halcombe
,
madam
,
have
not
leave
Blackwater
Park
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
I
hear
that
astounding
answer
,
all
my
thought
be
startle
back
on
the
instant
to
my
parting
with
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
say
I
reproach
myself
,
but
at
that
moment
I
think
I
would
have
give
many
a
year
's
hard
saving
to
have
know
four
hour
earlier
what
I
know
now
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
wait
,
quietly
arrange
her
nosegay
,
as
if
she
expect
me
to
say
something
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
Lady
Glyde
's
wear
-
out
energy
and
weakly
health
,
and
I
tremble
for
the
time
when
the
shock
of
the
discovery
that
I
have
make
would
fall
on
her
.
<EOS>
for
a
minute
or
more
my
fear
for
the
poor
lady
silence
me
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
that
time
Mrs.
Rubelle
look
up
sideways
from
her
flower
,
and
say
,
"
here
be
Sir
Percival
,
madam
,
return
from
his
ride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
see
him
as
soon
as
she
do
.
<EOS>
He
come
towards
us
,
slash
viciously
at
the
flower
with
his
riding
-
whip
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
near
enough
to
see
my
face
he
stop
,
strike
at
his
boot
with
the
whip
,
and
burst
out
laugh
,
so
harshly
and
so
violently
that
the
bird
fly
away
,
startle
,
from
the
tree
by
which
he
stand
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
"
he
say
,
"
you
have
find
it
out
at
last

have
you

"
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
reply
.
<EOS>
He
turn
to
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
do
you
show
yourself
in
the
garden
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
show
myself
about
half
an
hour
ago
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
say
I
may
take
my
liberty
again
as
soon
as
Lady
Glyde
have
go
away
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
right
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
blame
you
 
<EOS>
I
only
ask
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
wait
a
moment
,
and
then
address
himself
once
more
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
believe
it
,
can
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
mockingly
.
"
<EOS>
here
!
come
along
and
see
for
yourself

"
  
<EOS>
He
lead
the
way
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
follow
him
,
and
Mrs.
Rubelle
follow
me
.
<EOS>
after
pass
through
the
iron
gate
he
stop
,
and
point
with
his
whip
to
the
disused
middle
wing
of
the
building
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
!
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
look
up
at
the
first
floor

<EOS>
You
know
the
old
Elizabethan
bedroom

<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe

snug
and
safe
in
one
of
the
good
of

Mrs.
Rubelle

take
Mrs.
Michelson
in
,
and
let
her
own
eye
satisfy
her
that
there
be
no
deception
this
time

"
  
<EOS>
the
tone
in
which
he
speak
to
me
,
and
the
minute
or
two
that
have
pass
since
we
leave
the
garden
,
help
me
to
recover
my
spirit
a
little
.
<EOS>
what
I
may
have
do
at
this
critical
moment
,
if
all
my
life
have
be
pass
in
service
,
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
possess
the
feeling
,
the
principle
,
and
the
bringing
up
of
a
lady
,
I
could
not
hesitate
about
the
right
course
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
My
duty
to
myself
,
and
my
duty
to
Lady
Glyde
,
alike
forbid
me
to
remain
in
the
employment
of
a
man
who
have
shamefully
deceive
us
both
by
a
series
of
atrocious
falsehood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
beg
permission
,
Sir
Percival

to
speak
a
few
word
to
you
in
private

I
say
.
<EOS>
"
have
do
so

I
shall
be

proceed
with
this

Miss
Halcombe

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
whom
I
have
indicate
by
a
slight
turn
of
my
head
,
insolently
sniff
at
her
nosegay

walk
away

with
great
deliberation

towards

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I

He
eye
me
with
one
of

look

thrust
his

savagely
into
the
pocket
of
his
riding

coat

why
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
,
"
why

I
should

It
be
not

<EOS>
I
desire

give
no

I
merely
wish
to
say
that
I
do
not

he
break
out
in
his
most
violent
manner

I
see
what

You
have
take
your
own

underhand
view
of
an
innocent
deception
practise
on
Lady
Glyde
for
her
own
good

<EOS>
It
be
essential
to
her
health
that
she
should
have
a
change
of
air
immediately
,
and
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
she
would
never
have
go
away
if

She

scandal
about

my
affair

remember

have
a
change

at
the
early
possible
opportunity
.

bear
all
that
well

then

anything

<EOS>
He
pour
out
these
word
fiercely
,
all
in
a
breath
,
walk
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
strike
about
him
in
the
air
with
his
whip

<EOS>
nothing
that
he
say

do
shake
my
opinion
of
the
disgraceful
series
of
falsehood
that
he
have
tell
in

the
day
before

or
of
the
cruel
deception
by
which
he
have
separate
Lady
Glyde
from
her

and
have
send
her
uselessly
to
London
,
when
she
be
half
distract
with
anxiety
on
Miss
Halcombe
's
account

<EOS>
I
naturally
keep
these
thought
to
myself

say
nothing
more
to
irritate
him
;
but
I
be
not
the
less
resolve
to
persist
in
my
purpose

<EOS>
a
soft
answer
turneth
away
wrath
,
and
<EOS>
I
suppress
my
own
feeling
accordingly
when
it
be
my
turn

I

Miss

will
not
have
a
soul
leave
here
to
look
after
her

"
  
<EOS>
I
hope
it
be
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
that
I
be
quite
incapable
of
desert
Miss
Halcombe
in
such
an
emergency
as
have
now
befall
Lady
Glyde
and
herself
.
<EOS>
after
first
distinctly
ascertain
from
Sir
Percival
that
Mrs.
Rubelle
be
certain
to
leave
at
once
if
I
take
her
place
,
and
after
also
obtain
permission
to
arrange
for
Mr.
Dawson
's
resume
his
attendance
on
his
patient
,
I
willingly
consent
to
remain
at
Blackwater
Park
until
Miss
Halcombe
no
longer
require
my
service
.
<EOS>
It
be
settle
that
I
should
give
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
a
week
's
notice
before
I
leave
,
and
that
he
be
to
undertake
the
necessary
arrangement
for
appoint
my
successor
.
<EOS>
the
matter
be
discuss
in
very
few
word
.
<EOS>
at
its
conclusion
Sir
Percival
abruptly
turn
on
his
heel
,
and
leave
me
free
to
join
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
that
singular
foreign
person
have
be
sit
composedly
on
the
door
-
step
all
this
time
,
wait
till
I
could
follow
her
to
Miss
Halcombe
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
walk
half
-
way
towards
the
house
when
Sir
Percival
,
who
have
withdraw
in
the
opposite
direction
,
suddenly
stop
and
call
me
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
be
you
leave
my
service
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
the
question
be
so
extraordinary
,
after
what
have
just
pass
between
us
,
that
I
hardly
know
what
to
say
in
answer
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
mind
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why

be
go
,

he
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
give
a
reason
for
leave
me
,
I
suppose
,
when
you
get
another
situation
.
<EOS>
what
reason
?
<EOS>
the
breaking
up
of
the
family
?
<EOS>
be
that
it
?

<EOS>
"
there
can
be
no
positive

very
well

that
be
all
I
want

apply
for
your

that
be
your

state
by

You
go
in
consequence
of
the
breaking
up

<EOS>
He
turn
away
again
before
I
could
say
another
word
,
and
walk
out
rapidly
into
the
ground
.
<EOS>
His
manner
be
as
strange
as
his
language
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
he
alarm
me
.
  
<EOS>
even
the
patience
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
be
get
exhaust
,
when
I
join
her
at
the
house
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
last
!
"
she
say
,
with
a
shrug
of
her
lean
foreign
shoulder
.
<EOS>
She
lead
the
way
into
the
inhabited
side
of
the
house
,
ascend
the
stair
,
and
open
with
her
key
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
,
which
communicate
with
the
old
Elizabethan
room
 
a
door
never
previously
use
,
in
my
time
,
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
the
room
themselves
<EOS>
I
know
well
,
have
enter
them
myself
on
various
occasion
from
the
other
side
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
stop
at
the
third
door
along
the
old
gallery
,
hand
me
the
key
of
it
,
with
the
key
of
the
door
of
communication
,
and
tell
me
I
should
find
Miss
Halcombe
in
that
room
.
<EOS>
before
I
go
in
I
think
it
desirable
to
make
her
understand
that
her
attendance
have
cease
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
tell
her
in
plain
word
that
the
charge
of
the
sick
lady
henceforth
devolve
entirely
on
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
it
,
madam
,
"
say
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
go
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
leave
to

day
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
to
make
sure
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
that
you
have
take
charge
,
madam
,
I
leave
in
half
an
hour
's
time

<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
kindly
place
at
my
disposition
the
gardener
,
and
the
chaise
,
whenever
I
want
them
.
<EOS>
I
shall
want
them
in
half
an
hour
's
time
to
go
to
the
station

<EOS>
I
be
pack
up
in
anticipation
already

<EOS>
I
wish
you
good

day

madam

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
drop
a
brisk
curtsey
,
and
walk
back
along
the
gallery
,
hum
a
little
tune
,
and
keep
time
to
it
cheerfully
with
the
nosegay
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
I
be
sincerely
thankful
to
say
that
be
the
last
I
see
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
go
into
the
room
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
be
asleep
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
her
anxiously
,
as
she
lie
in
the
dismal
,
high
,
old
-
fashioned
bed
.
<EOS>
She
be
certainly
not
in
any
respect
alter
for
the
bad
since
I
have
see
her
last
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
neglect
,
I
be
bind
to
admit
,
in
any
way
that
I
could
perceive
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
dreary
,
and
dusty
,
and
dark
,
but
the
window
(
look
on
a
solitary
court
-
yard
at
the
back
of
the
house
)
be
open
to
let
in
the
fresh
air
,
and
all
that
could
be
do
to
make
the
place
comfortable
have
be
do
.
<EOS>
the
whole
cruelty
of
Sir
Percival
's
deception
have
fall
on
poor
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
the
only
ill
-
usage
which
either
he
or
Mrs.
Rubelle
have
inflict
on
Miss
Halcombe
consist
,
so
far
as
I
could
see
,
in
the
first
offence
of
hide
her
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
steal
back
,
leave
the
sick
lady
still
peacefully
asleep
,
to
give
the
gardener
instruction
about
bring
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
I
beg
the
man
,
after
he
have
take
Mrs.
Rubelle
to
the
station
,
to
drive
round
by
Mr.
Dawson
's
,
and
leave
a
message
in
my
name
,
ask
him
to
call
and
see
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
come
on
my
account
,
and
I
know
he
would
remain
when
he
find
Count
Fosco
have
leave
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
in
due
course
of
time
the
gardener
return
,
and
say
that
he
have
drive
round
by
Mr.
Dawson
's

<EOS>

word
that
he
be
poorly
in
health
himself
,
but
that
he
would
call
,
if
possible
,
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
have
deliver
his
message
the
gardener
be
about
to
withdraw
,
but
I
stop
him
to
request
that
he
would
come
back
before
dark
,
and
sit
up
that
night
,
in
one
of
the
empty
bedroom
,
so
as
to
be
within
call
in
case
<EOS>
I
want
him
.
<EOS>
He
understand
readily
enough
my
unwillingness
to
be
leave
alone
all
night
in
the
most
desolate
part
of
that
desolate
house
,
and
we
arrange
that
he
should
come
in
between
eight
and
nine
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
punctually
,
and
I
find
cause
to
be
thankful
that
I
have
adopt
the
precaution
of
call
him
in
.
<EOS>
before
midnight
Sir
Percival
's
strange
temper
break
out
in
the
most
violent
and
most
alarming
manner
,
and
if
the
gardener
have
not
be
on
the
spot
to
pacify
him
on
the
instant
,
I
be
afraid
to
think
what
may
have
happen
.
  
<EOS>
almost
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
he
have
be
walk
about
the
house
and
ground
in
an
unsettled
,
excitable
manner
,
have
,
in
all
probability
,
as
I
think
,
take
an
excessive
quantity
of
wine
at
his
solitary
dinner
.
<EOS>
however
that
may
be
,
I
hear
his
voice
call
loudly
and
angrily
in
the
new
wing
of
the
house
,
as
I
be
take
a
turn
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
gallery
the
last
thing
at
night
.
<EOS>
the
gardener
immediately
run
down
to
him
,
and
I
close
the
door
of
communication
,
to
keep
the
alarm
,
if
possible
,
from
reach
Miss
Halcombe
's
ear
.
<EOS>
It
be
full
half
an
hour
before
the
gardener
come
back
.
<EOS>
He
declare
that
his
master
be
quite
out
of
his
sense
 
not
through
the
excitement
of
drink
,
as
I
have
suppose
,
but
through
a
kind
of
panic
or
frenzy
of
mind
,
for
which
it
be
impossible
to
account
.
<EOS>
He
have
find
Sir
Percival
walk
backwards
and
forwards
by
himself
in
the
hall
,
swear
,
with
every
appearance
of
the
most
violent
passion
,
that
he
would
not
stop
another
minute
alone
in
such
a
dungeon
as
his
own
house
,
and
that
he
would
take
the
first
stage
of
his
journey
immediately
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
the
gardener
,
on
approach
him
,
have
be
hunt
out
,
with
oath
and
threat
,
to
get
the
horse
and
chaise
ready
instantly
.
<EOS>
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Sir
Percival
have
join
him
in
the
yard
,
have
jump
into
the
chaise
,
and
,
lash
the
horse
into
a
gallop
,
have
drive
himself
away
,
with
his
face
as
pale
as
ashe
in
the
moonlight
.
<EOS>
the
gardener
have
hear
him
shout
and
curse
at
the
lodge
-
keeper
to
get
up
and
open
the
gate
 
have
hear
the
wheel
roll
furiously
on
again
in
the
still
night
,
when
the
gate
be
unlock
 
and
know
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
or
a
day
or
two
after
,
I
forget
which
,
the
chaise
be
bring
back
from
Knowlesbury
,
our
near
town
,
by
the
ostler
at
the
old
inn
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
stop
there
,
and
have
afterwards
leave
by
the
train
 
for
what
destination
the
man
could
not
tell
.
<EOS>
I
never
receive
any
further
information
,
either
from
himself
or
from
any
one
else
,
of
Sir
Percival
's
proceeding
,
and
I
be
not
even
aware
,
at
this
moment
,
whether
he
be
in
England
or
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
have
not
meet
since
he
drive
away
like
an
escaped
criminal
from
his
own
house
,
and
it
be
my
fervent
hope
and
prayer
that
we
may
never
meet
again
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
part
of
this
sad
family
story
be
now
draw
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
inform
that
the
particular
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
waking
,
and
of
what
pass
between
us
when
she
find
me
sit
by
her
bedside
,
be
not
material
to
the
purpose
which
be
to
be
answer
by
the
present
narrative
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
sufficient
for
me
to
say
in
this
place
,
that
she
be
not
herself
conscious
of
the
mean
adopt
to
remove
her
from
the
inhabit
to
the
uninhabited
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
deep
sleep
at
the
time
,
whether
naturally
or
artificially
produce
she
could
not
say
.
<EOS>
in
my
absence
at
Torquay
,
and
in
the
absence
of
all
the
resident
servant
except
Margaret
Porcher
(
who
be
perpetually
eat
,
drink
,
or
sleep
,
when
she
be
not
at
work
)
,
the
secret
transfer
of
Miss
Halcombe
from
one
part
of
the
house
to
the
other
be
no
doubt
easily
perform
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
(
as
I
discover
for
myself
,
in
look
about
the
room
)
have
provision
,
and
all
other
necessary
,
together
with
the
mean
of
heating
water
,
broth
,
and
so
on
,
without
kindle
a
fire
,
place
at
her
disposal
during
the
few
day
of
her
imprisonment
with
the
sick
lady
.
<EOS>
She
have
decline
to
answer
the
question
which
Miss
Halcombe
naturally
put
,
but
have
not
,
in
other
respect
,
treat
her
with
unkindness
or
neglect
.
<EOS>
the
disgrace
of
lend
herself
to
a
vile
deception
be
the
only
disgrace
with
which
I
can
conscientiously
charge
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
write
no
particular
(
and
I
be
relieved
to
know
it
)
of
the
effect
produce
on
Miss
Halcombe
by
the
news
of
Lady
Glyde
's
departure
,
or
by
the
far
more
melancholy
tiding
which
reach
us
only
too
soon
afterwards
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
in
both
case
I
prepare
her
mind
beforehand
as
gently
and
as
carefully
as
possible
,
have
the
doctor
's
advice
to
guide
me
,
in
the
last
case
only
,
through
Mr.
Dawson
's
be
too
unwell
to
come
to
the
house
for
some
day
after
I
have
send
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
time
,
a
time
which
it
afflict
me
to
think
of
or
to
write
of
now
.
<EOS>
the
precious
blessing
of
religious
consolation
which
I
endeavour
to
convey
be
long
in
reach
Miss
Halcombe
's
heart
,
but
I
hope
and
believe
they
come
home
to
her
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
never
leave
her
till
her
strength
be
restore
.
<EOS>
the
train
which
take
me
away
from
that
miserable
house
be
the
train
which
take
her
away
also
.
<EOS>
We
part
very
mournfully
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
remain
with
a
relative
at
Islington
,
and
she
go
on
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
house
in
Cumberland
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
a
few
line
more
to
write
before
I
close
this
painful
statement
.
<EOS>
They
be
dictate
by
a
sense
of
duty
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
I
wish
to
record
my
own
personal
conviction
that
no
blame
whatever
,
in
connection
with
the
event
which
I
have
now
relate
,
attach
to
Count
Fosco
.
<EOS>
I
be
inform
that
a
dreadful
suspicion
have
be
raise
,
and
that
some
very
serious
construction
be
place
upon
his
lordship
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
My
persuasion
of
the
Count
's
innocence
remain
,
however
,
quite
unshaken
.
<EOS>
if
he
assist
Sir
Percival
in
send
me
to
Torquay
,
he
assist
under
a
delusion
,
for
which
,
as
a
foreigner
and
a
stranger
,
he
be
not
to
blame
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
concerned
in
bring
Mrs.
Rubelle
to
Blackwater
Park
,
it
be
his
misfortune
and
not
his
fault
,
when
that
foreign
person
be
base
enough
to
assist
a
deception
plan
and
carry
out
by
the
master
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
protest
,
in
the
interest
of
morality
,
against
blame
be
gratuitously
and
wantonly
attach
to
the
proceeding
of
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
second
place
,
I
desire
to
express
my
regret
at
my
own
inability
to
remember
the
precise
day
on
which
Lady
Glyde
leave
Blackwater
Park
for
London
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
that
it
be
of
the
last
importance
to
ascertain
the
exact
date
of
that
lamentable
journey
,
and
I
have
anxiously
tax
my
memory
to
recall
it
.
<EOS>
the
effort
have
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
remember
now
that
it
be
towards
the
latter
part
of
July
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
the
difficulty
,
after
a
lapse
of
time
,
of
fix
precisely
on
a
past
date
unless
it
have
be
previously
write
down
.
<EOS>
that
difficulty
be
greatly
increase
in
my
case
by
the
alarming
and
confusing
event
which
take
place
about
the
period
of
Lady
Glyde
's
departure
.
<EOS>
I
heartily
wish
I
have
make
a
memorandum
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
heartily
wish
my
memory
of
the
date
be
as
vivid
as
my
memory
of
that
poor
lady
's
face
,
when
it
look
at
me
sorrowfully
for
the
last
time
from
the
carriage
window
.
  
<EOS>

STORY

FOSCO
  
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
say
that
I
have
never
learn
to
read
or
write
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
hard
-
work
woman
all
my
life
,
and
have
keep
a
good
character
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
it
be
a
sin
and
wickedness
to
say
the
thing
which
be
not
,
and
I
will
truly
beware
of
do
so
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
all
that
I
know
I
will
tell
,
and
I
humbly
beg
the
gentleman
who
take
this
down
to
put
my
language
right
as
he
go
on
,
and
to
make
allowance
for
my
be
no
scholar
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
last
summer
I
happen
to
be
out
of
place
(
through
no
fault
of
my
own
)
,
and
I
hear
of
a
situation
as
plain
cook
,
at
Number
Five
,
Forest
Road
,
<EOS>
St.
John
's
Wood

<EOS>
I

the
place
on
trial
.

<EOS>
My

<EOS>

do
housemaid
's
work
when
I
get
there
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
over
-
clean
or
tidy
,
but
there
be
no
harm
in
her
.
<EOS>
I
and
she
be
the
only
servant
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Our
master
and
mistress
come
after
we
get
in
;
and
as
soon
as
they
do
come
we
be

downstairs
,
that
company

<EOS>
the
company

my
mistress
's
niece
,
and
the
back
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
be
get
ready
for
her

<EOS>
My
mistress
mention
to
me
that
Lady
Glyde
(
that
be
her
name
)
be
in
poor
health
,
and
that
I
must
be
particular
in
my
cooking
accordingly
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
come
that
day
,
as
well
as
I
can
remember
 
but
whatever
you
do
,
do
not
trust
my
memory
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
say
it
be
no
use
ask
me
about
day
of
the
month
,
and
such
-
like
.
<EOS>
except
Sundays
,
half
my
time
I
take
no
heed
of
them
,
be
a
hard
-
work
woman
and
no
scholar
.
<EOS>
all
I
know
be
Lady
Glyde
come
,
and
when
she
do
come
,
a
fine
fright
she
give
us
all
surely
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
master
bring
her
to
the
house
,
be
hard
at
work
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
bring
her
in
the
afternoon
,
I
think
,
and
the
housemaid
open
the
door
to
them
,
and
show
them
into
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
before
she
have
be
long
down
in
the
kitchen
again
with
me
,
we
hear
a
hurry
-
skurry
upstairs
,
and
the
parlour
bell
ring
like
mad
,
and
my
mistress
's
voice
call
out
for
help
.
  
<EOS>
We
both
run
up
,
and
there
we
see
the
lady
lay
on
the
sofa
,
with
her
face
ghastly
white
,
and
her
hand
fast
clench
,
and
her
head
draw
down
to
one
side
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
take
with
a
sudden
fright
,
my
mistress
say
,
and
master
he
tell
us
<EOS>
she
be
in
a
fit
of
convulsion
.
<EOS>
I
run
out
,
know
the
neighbourhood
a
little
well
than
the
rest
of
them
,
to
fetch
the
near
doctor
's
help
.
<EOS>
the
near
help
be
at
Goodricke
's
and
Garth
's
,
who
work
together
as
partner
,
and
have
a
good
name
and
connection
,
as
I
have
hear
,
all
round
St.
John
's
Wood
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Goodricke
be
in
,
and
he
come
back
with
me
directly
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
before
he
could
make
himself
of
much
use
.
<EOS>
the
poor
unfortunate
lady
fall
out
of
one
fit
into
another
,
and
go
on
so
till
she
be
quite
weary
out
,
and
as
helpless
as
a
new
-
bear
babe
.
<EOS>
We
then
get
her
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Goodricke
go
away
to
his
house
for
medicine
,
and
come
back
again
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
less
.
<EOS>
besides
the
medicine
he
bring
a
bit
of
hollow
mahogany
wood
with
him
,
shape
like
a
kind
of
trumpet
,
and
after
wait
a
little
while
,
he
put
one
end
over
the
lady
's
heart
and
the
other
to
his
ear
,
and
listen
carefully
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
he
say
to
my
mistress
,
who
be
in
the
room
,
"
this
be
a
very
serious
case
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
recommend
you
to
write
to
Lady
Glyde
's
friend
directly
.
<EOS>
"
My
mistress
say
to
him
,
"
be
it
heart
-
disease
?
"
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
"
yes
,
heart
-
disease
of
a
most
dangerous
kind
.
"
<EOS>
He
tell
her
exactly
what
he
think
be
the
matter
,
which
I
be
not
clever
enough
to
understand
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
this
,
he
end
by
say
that
he
be
afraid
neither
his
help
nor
any
other
doctor
's
help
be
likely
to
be
of
much
service
.
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
take
this
ill
news
more
quietly
than
my
master
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
big
,
fat
,
odd
sort
of
elderly
man
,
who
keep
bird
and
white
mouse
,
and
speak
to
them
as
if
they
be
so
many
christian
child
.
<EOS>
He
seem
terribly
cut
up
by
what
have
happen
.
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
poor
Lady
Glyde
!
<EOS>
poor
dear
Lady
Glyde
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
and
go
stalk
about
,
wring
his
fat
hand
more
like
a
play
-
actor
than
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
for
one
question
my
mistress
ask
the
doctor
about
the
lady
's
chance
of
get
round
,
he
ask
a
good
fifty
at
least
.
<EOS>
I
declare
he
quite
torment
us
all
,
and
when
he
be
quiet
at
last
,
out
he
go
into
the
bit
of
back
garden
,
pick
trumpery
little
nosegay
,
and
ask
me
to
take
them
upstairs
and
make
the
sick
-
room
look
pretty
with
them
.
<EOS>
as
if
that
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
must
have
be
,
at
time
,
a
little
soft
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
a
bad
master
 
<EOS>
he
have
a
monstrous
civil
tongue
of
his
own
,
and
a
jolly
,
easy
,
coax
way
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
like
him
a
deal
well
than
my
mistress
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
hard
one
,
if
ever
there
be
a
hard
one
yet
.
  
<EOS>
towards
night
-
time
the
lady
rouse
up
a
little
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
so
weary
out
,
before
that
,
by
the
convulsion
,
that
she
never
stir
hand
or
foot
,
or
speak
a
word
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
She
move
in
the
bed
now
,
and
stare
about
her
at
the
room
and
us
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
be
a
nice
-
look
lady
when
well
,
with
light
hair
,
and
blue
eye
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
Her
rest
be
trouble
at
night
 
at
least
so
I
hear
from
my
mistress
,
who
sit
up
alone
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
only
go
in
once
before
go
to
bed
to
see
if
I
could
be
of
any
use
,
and
then
she
be
talk
to
herself
in
a
confused
,
ramble
manner
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
want
sadly
to
speak
to
somebody
who
be
absent
from
her
somewhere
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
catch
the
name
the
first
time
,
and
the
second
time
master
knock
at
the
door
,
with
his
regular
mouthful
of
question
,
and
another
of
his
trumpery
nosegay
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
go
in
early
the
next
morning
,
the
lady
be
clean
wear
out
again
,
and
lie
in
a
kind
of
faint
sleep
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Goodricke
bring
his
partner
,
Mr.
Garth
,
with
him
to
advise
.
<EOS>
They
say
she
must
not
be
disturb
out
of
her
rest
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
They
ask
my
mistress
many
question
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
about
what
the
lady
's
health
have
be
in
past
time
,
and
who
have
attend
her
,
and
whether
she
have
ever
suffer
much
and
long
together
under
distress
of
mind
.
<EOS>
I
remember
my
mistress
say
"
yes
"
to
that
last
question
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Goodricke
look
at
Mr.
Garth
,
and
shake
his
head
;
and
Mr.
Garth
look
at
Mr.
Goodricke
,
and
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
think
that
the
distress
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
mischief
at
the
lady
's
heart
.
<EOS>
She
be
but
a
frail
thing
to
look
at
,
poor
creature
!
<EOS>
very
little
strength
at
any
time
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
 
very
little
strength
.
  
<EOS>
later
on
the
same
morning
,
when
she
wake
,
the
lady
take
a
sudden
turn
,
and
get
seemingly
a
great
deal
better
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
let
in
again
to
see
her
,
no
more
be
the
housemaid
,
for
the
reason
that
she
be
not
to
be
disturb
by
stranger
.
<EOS>
what
I
hear
of
her
be
well
be
through
my
master
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
wonderful
good
spirit
about
the
change
,
and
look
in
at
the
kitchen
window
from
the
garden
,
with
his
great
big
curly
-
brim
white
hat
on
,
to
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good

Cook

"
say
he
,
"
Lady
Glyde
be
well
.
<EOS>
My
mind
be
more
easy
than

and
I
be
go
out
to
stretch
my
big
leg
with
a
sunny
little
summer
walk
.
<EOS>
Shall

<EOS>
"
that
be
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
be
past
sixty
,
and
fond
of
pastry
.
<EOS>
just
think
of
that
!
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
come
again
in
the
forenoon
,
and
see
for
himself
that
Lady
Glyde
have
wake
up
better
.
<EOS>
He
forbid
us
to
talk
to
her
,
or
to
let
her
talk
to
us
,
in
case
she
be
that
way
disposed
,
say
she
must
be
keep
quiet
before
all
thing
,
and
encourage
to
sleep
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
seem
to
want
to
talk
whenever
I
see
her
,
except
overnight
,
when
I
could
not
make
out
what
she
be
say
 
<EOS>
she
seem
too
much
wear
down
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Goodricke
be
not
nearly
in
such
good
spirit
about
her
as
master
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
when
he
come
downstairs
,
except
that
he
would
call
again
at
five
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
about
that
time
(
which
be
before

<EOS>

,
and
call
to
me
to

Mr.
Goodricke
,
and
tell
him

lady

<EOS>
I
get
on

bonnet
and
shawl
,
when
,
as
good
luck
would
have
it
,
the
doctor
himself
come
to
the
house
for

promised
visit
.
  
<EOS>
I
let

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
She

Jane
Gould

<EOS>
I
consider
her
to
be
a
respectable
-
looking
woman
.
<EOS>
She
make
no
remark
,
except
to
say
that
she
understand
what
be
want
of
her
,
and
that
she
have
wind
a
many
of

in

<EOS>
when
I
do
see
him

<EOS>
He

quiet
in

corner
,
with
his
fat
hand
hang
over
his
thick
knee
,
and
his
head
down
,
and
his
eye
look
at
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
seem
not
so
much
sorry
,
as
scared
and
dazed
like

by

.
<EOS>
My
mistress

death
by
the
Indians

death
by

all
three

Liverpool

<EOS>
the
ship
reach
her
port
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
October
1850
.
<EOS>
We
land
late
in
the
afternoon
,
and
I
arrive
in
London
the
same
night
.
  
<EOS>
these
page
be
not
the
record
of
my
wandering
and
my
danger
away
from
home
.
<EOS>
the
motive
which
lead
me
from
my
country
and
my
friend
to
a
new
world
of
adventure
and
peril
be
know
.
<EOS>
from
that
self
-
impose
exile
I
come
back
,
as
I
have
hope
,
pray
,
believe
I
should
come
back
 
a
changed
man
.
<EOS>
in
the
water
of
a
new
life
I
have
temper
my
nature
afresh
.
<EOS>
in
the
stern
school
of
extremity
and
danger
my
will
have
learn
to
be
strong
,
my
heart
to
be
resolute
,
my
mind
to
rely
on
itself
.
<EOS>
I
have
go
out
to
fly
from
my
own
future
.
<EOS>
I
come
back
to
face
it
,
as
a
man
should
.
  
<EOS>
to
face
it
with
that
inevitable
suppression
of
myself
which
I
know
it
would
demand
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
part
with
the
bad
bitterness
of
the
past
,
but
not
with
my
heart
's
remembrance
of
the
sorrow
and
the
tenderness
of
that
memorable
time
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
cease
to
feel
the
one
irreparable
disappointment
of
my
life
 
I
have
only
learn
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
Laura
Fairlie
be
in
all
my
thought
when
the
ship
bear
me
away
,
and
I
look
my
last
at
England
.
<EOS>
Laura
Fairlie
be
in
all
my
thought
when
the
ship
bring
me
back
,
and
the
morning
light
show
the
friendly
shore
in

<EOS>
My
pen
trace
the
old
letter
as
my
heart
go
back
to
the
old
love
.
<EOS>
I
write
of
her
as
Laura
Fairlie
still
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
to
think
of
her
,
it
be
hard
to
speak
of
her
,
by
her
husband
's
name
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
more
word
of
explanation
to
add
on
my
appearance
for
the
second
time
in
these
page
.
<EOS>
this
narrative
,
if
I
have
the
strength
and
the
courage
to
write
it
,
may
now
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
anxiety
and
first
hope
when
the
morning
come
centre
in
my
mother
and
my
sister
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
necessity
of
prepare
them
for
the
joy
and
surprise
of
my
return
,
after
an
absence
during
which
it
have
be
impossible
for
them
to
receive
any
tiding
of
me
for
month
past
.
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
I
send
a
letter
to
the
Hampstead
Cottage
,
and
follow
it
myself
in
an
hour
's
time
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
first
meeting
be
over
,
when
our
quiet
and
composure
of
other
day
begin
gradually
to
return
to
us
,
I
see
something
in
my
mother
's
face
which
tell
me
that
a
secret
oppression
lie
heavy
on
her
heart
.
<EOS>
there
be
more
than
love
 
<EOS>
there
be
sorrow
in
the
anxious
eye
that
look
on
me
<EOS>
so
tenderly
 
there
be
pity
in
the
kind
hand
that
slowly
and
fondly
strengthen
its
hold
on
mine
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
concealment
from
each
other
.
<EOS>
She
know
how
the
hope
of
my
life
have
be
wreck
 
<EOS>
she
know
why
I
have
leave
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
my
lip
to
ask
as
composedly
<EOS>
as
I
could
if
any
letter
have
come
for
me
from
Miss
Halcombe
,
if
there
be
any
news
of
her
sister
that
I
may
hear
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
look
in
my
mother
's
face
I
lose
courage
to
put
the
question
even
in
that
guard
form
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
say
,
doubtingly
and
restrainedly
    
"
You
have
something
to
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
sister
,
who
have
be
sit
opposite
to
us
,
rise
suddenly
without
a
word
of
explanation
 
rise
and
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
move
closer
to
me
on
the
sofa
and
put
her
arm
round
my
neck
.
<EOS>
those
fond
arm
tremble
 
<EOS>
the
tear
flow
fast
over
the
faithful
loving
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
she
whisper
,
"
my
own
darling
!
<EOS>
my
heart
be
heavy
for
you
.
<EOS>
oh
,
my
son
!
<EOS>
my
son
!
<EOS>
try
to
remember
that
I
be
still
leave
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
head
sink
on
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
all
in
say
those
word
.
     
<EOS>
It
be
the
morning
of
the
third
day
since
my
return
 
the
morning
of
the
sixteenth
of
October
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
remain
with
them
at
the
cottage
 
I
have
try
hard
not
to
embitter
the
happiness
of
my
return
to
them
as
it
be
embitter
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
all
man
could
to
rise
after
the
shock
,
and
accept
my
life
resignedly
 
to
let
my
great
sorrow
come
in
tenderness
to
my
heart
,
and
not
in
despair
.
<EOS>
It
be
useless
and
hopeless
.
<EOS>
no
tear
soothe
my
aching
eye
,
no
relief
come
to
me
from
my
sister
's
sympathy
or
my
mother
's
love
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
third
morning
I
open
my
heart
to
them
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
word
pass
my
lip
which
I
have
long
to
speak
on
the
day
when
my
mother
tell
me
of
her
death
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
go
away
alone
for
a
little
while
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
bear
it
better
when
I
have
look
once
more
at
the
place
where
I
first
see
her
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
knelt
and
pray
by
the
grave
where
they
have
lay
her
to
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
depart
on
my
journey
 
my
journey
to
the
grave
of
Laura
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
quiet
autumn
afternoon
when
I
stop
at
the
solitary
station
,
and
set
forth
alone
on
foot
by
the
well
-
remember
road
.
<EOS>
the
wane
sun
be
shine
faintly
through
thin
white
cloud
 
the
air
be
warm
and
still
 
the
peacefulness
of
the
lonely
country
be
overshadow
and
sadden
by
the
influence
of
the
fall
year
.
  
<EOS>
I
reach
the
moor
 
<EOS>
I
stand
again
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
 
<EOS>
I
look
on
along
the
path
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
the
familiar
garden
tree
in
the
distance
,
the
clear
sweeping
semicircle
of
the
drive
,
the
high
white
wall
of
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
the
chance
and
change
,
the
wandering
and
danger
of
month
and
month
past
,
all
shrink
and
shrivel
to
nothing
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
yesterday
since
my
foot
have
last
trodden
the
fragrant
heathy
ground
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
see
her
come
to
meet
me
,
with
her
little
straw
hat
shade
her
face
,
her
simple
dress
flutter
in
the
air
,
and
her
well
-
fill
sketch
-
book
ready
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
oh
death
,
thou
hast
<EOS>
thy
sting
!
<EOS>
oh
,
grave
,
thou
hast
thy
victory
!
  
<EOS>
I
turn
aside
,
and
there
below
me
in
the
glen
be
the
lonesome
grey
church
,
the
porch
where
I
have
wait
for
the
coming
of
the
woman
in
white
,
the
hill
encircle
the
quiet
burial
-
ground
,
the
brook
bubble
cold
over
its
stony
bed
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
marble
cross
,
fair
and
white
,
at
the
head
of
the
tomb
 
<EOS>
the
tomb
that
now
rise
over
mother
and
daughter
alike
.
  
<EOS>
I
approach
the
grave
.
<EOS>
I
cross
once
more
the
low
stone
stile
,
and
bare
my
head
as
I
touch
the
sacred
ground
.
<EOS>
sacred
to
gentleness
and
goodness
,
sacred
to
reverence
and
grief
.
  
<EOS>
I
stop
before
the
pedestal
from
which
the
cross
rise
.
<EOS>
on
one
side
of
it
,
on
the
side
near
to
me
,
the
newly
-
cut
inscription
meet
my
eye
 
the
hard
,
clear
,
cruel
black
letter
which
tell
the
story
of
her
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
read
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
read
as
far
as
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
sacred
to
the
memory
of
Laura
 
<EOS>
"
the
kind
blue
eye
dim
with
tear
 
<EOS>
the
fair
head
droop
wearily
 
the
innocent
parting
word
which
implore
me
to
leave
her
 
<EOS>
oh
,
for
a
happy
last
memory
of
her
than
this
;
the
memory
I
take
away
with
me
,
the
memory
I
bring
back
with
me
to
her
grave
!
  
<EOS>
a
second
time
I
try
to
read
the
inscription
.
<EOS>
I
see
at
the
end
the
date
of
her
death
,
and
above
it
    
<EOS>
above
it
there
be
line
on
the
marble
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
name
among
them
which
disturb
my
thought
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
go
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
grave
,
where
there
be
nothing
to
read
,
nothing
of
earthly
vileness
to
force
its
way
between
her
spirit
and
mine
.
  
<EOS>
I
knelt
down
by
the
tomb
.
<EOS>
I
lay
my
hand
,
I
lay
my
head
on
the
broad
white
stone
,
and
close
my
weary
eye
on
the
earth
around
,
on
the
light
above
.
<EOS>
I
let
her
come
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
oh
,
my
love
!
<EOS>
my
love
!
<EOS>
my
heart
may
speak
to
you
now
!
<EOS>
It
be
yesterday
again
since
we
part
 
yesterday
,
since
your
dear
hand
lie
in
mine
 
yesterday
,
since
my
eye
look
their
last
on
you
.
<EOS>
My
love

my
love

<EOS>
Time
have
flow
on
,
and
silence
have
fall
like
thick
night
over
its
course
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
sound
that
come
after
the
heavenly
peace
rustle
faintly
like
a
passing
breath
of
air
over
the
grass
of
the
burial
-
ground
.
<EOS>
I
hear
it
near
me
slowly
,
until
it
come
changed
to
my
ear
 
<EOS>
come
like
footstep
move
onward
 
then
stop
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
up

<EOS>

sunset
be
near
at

<EOS>
the
cloud
have
part
 
the
slant
light
fall
mellow
over
the
hill
.
<EOS>
the
last
of
the
day
be
cold
and
clear
and
still
in
the
quiet
valley
of
the
dead

<EOS>
beyond
me
,
in
the
burial
-
ground

stand
together
in
the
cold
clearness

They

<EOS>
when
they
stop

grief
write
on
her
as

I
take
one
step
towards
her
from
the
grave

<EOS>
She
never

<EOS>
the
veiled

the
third
epoch
  
<EOS>
the
STORY
CONTINUED
by
WALTER
HARTRIGHT
.
      
<EOS>
I
open
a
new
page
.
<EOS>
I
advance
my
narrative
by
one
week
.
  
<EOS>
the
history
of
the
interval
which
I
thus
pass
over
must
remain
unrecorded
.
<EOS>
My
heart
turn
faint
,
my
mind
sink
in
darkness
and
confusion
when
I
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
this
must
not
be
,
if
I
who
write
be
to
guide
,
as
I
ought
,
you
who
read
.
<EOS>
this
must
not
be
,
if
the
clue
that
lead
through
the
winding
of
the
story
be
to
remain
from
end
to
end
untangled
in
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
a
life
suddenly
change
 
its
whole
purpose
create
afresh
,
<EOS>
its
hope
and
fear
,
its
struggle
,
its
interest
,
and
its
sacrifice
all
turn
at
once
and
for
ever
into
a
new
direction
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
prospect
which
now
open
before
me
,
like
the
burst
of
view
from
a
mountain
's
top
.
<EOS>
I
leave
my
narrative
in
the
quiet
shadow
of
Limmeridge
church
 
<EOS>
I
resume
it
,
one
week

<EOS>
It

upon
the
effect
<EOS>
which
the
intelligence
of
Lady
Glyde
's
sudden
death

on
her
sister

<EOS>
It
be
only
useful
to
the
present
purpose
to
say
that
she

<EOS>
at

<EOS>
on
part
with
the

include
)
 
her
suspicion
of
the
circumstance
under
which
Lady
Glyde
be
say
to
have

<EOS>
Mr.
Kyrle
,
who
have
previously
give
friendly
proof
of
his
anxiety
to
serve
Miss
Halcombe
,
at
once
undertook
to
make
such
inquiry
as
the
delicate
and
dangerous
nature
of
the
investigation
propose
to
him
would
permit
.
  
<EOS>
to
exhaust
this
part
of
the
subject
before
go
farther
,
it
may
be
mention
that
Count
Fosco

every
facility
to
Mr.

on
that

the
result

doctor
's
and
the
servant
'
evidence
,
and
of
the
volunteer
statement
of
Count
Fosco
and
his
wife
,
be
conclusive
to
the
mind
of
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
assume
that
the
intensity
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
suffering
,
under
the
loss
of
her
sister
,
have
mislead
her
judgment
in
a
most
deplorable

in

Anne
Catherick
(
of

hear
full
particular
from
Miss
Halcombe
when
she
reach
Limmeridge
)
have
be
trace
and
recover
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Blackwater
Park

and
have
be
for
the
second
time

under
the
charge
of

custody
she
have
once
escape

<EOS>
this
be
the
first
part
of
the
postscript

<EOS>
the
second
part
warn
Mr.
Fairlie
that
Anne
Catherick
's
mental
malady
have
be
aggravate
by
her
long
freedom
from

and
that
the
insane
hatred
and
distrust
of
Sir
Percival

,
which
have
be
one
of
her
most
marked
delusion
in

<EOS>
the
unfortunate

the
idea

Glyde

she
have
observe
the
extraordinary
accidental
likeness

<EOS>
It
be
to
the
last
degree
improbable
that
she
would
succeed
a
second
time
in
escape
from
the
Asylum
,
but
it
be
just
possible
she
may
find
some
mean
of
annoy
the
late
Lady
Glyde
's
relative
with
letter
,
and
in
that
case
Mr.

<EOS>
They

the
posture

shortly

<EOS>
although

address
of
the
Asylum
,
that
important
omission

the
other
particular
of

exactly
as

from
Mr.

's
own
lip
.
<EOS>
accordingly
she
look
back
at
the

and
extract

herself
with
the
Count
's
letter
to
Mr.

of
credential
which

to

,
and

for
the
Asylum
on
the
eleventh
of
October
.
  
<EOS>
She
pass
the
night
of
the
eleventh
in
London
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
her
intention
to
sleep
at
the
house
inhabit
by
Lady
Glyde
's
old
governess
,
but
Mrs.
Vesey
's
agitation
at
the
sight
of
her
lost
pupil
's
near
and
dear
friend
be
so
distress
that
Miss
Halcombe
considerately
refrain
from
remain
in
her
presence
,
and
remove
to
a
respectable
boarding
-
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
recommend
by
Mrs.
Vesey
's
married
sister
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
she
proceed
to
the
Asylum
,
which
be
situate
not
far
from
London
on
the
northern
side
of
the
metropolis
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
immediately
admit
to
see
the
proprietor
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
he
appear
to
be
decidedly
unwilling
to
let
her
communicate
with
his
patient
.
<EOS>
but
on
her
show
him
the
postscript
to
Count
Fosco
's
letter
 
on
her
remind
him
that
she
be
the
"
Miss
Halcombe
"
there
refer
to
 
that
she
be
a
near
relative
of
the
deceased
Lady
Glyde
 
and
that
she
be
therefore
naturally
interested
,
for
family
reason
,
in
observe
for
herself
the
extent
of
Anne
Catherick
's
delusion
in
relation
to
her
late
sister
 
<EOS>
the
tone
and
manner
of
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
alter
,
and
he
withdraw
his
objection
.
<EOS>
He
probably
feel
that
a
continue
refusal
,
under
these
circumstance
,
would
not
only
be
an
act
of
discourtesy
in
itself
,
but
would
also
imply
that
the
proceeding
in
his
establishment
be
not
of
a
nature
to
bear
investigation
by
respectable
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
's
own
impression
be
that
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
have
not
be
receive
into
the
confidence
of
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
.
<EOS>
His
consenting
at
all
to
let
her
visit
his
patient
seem
to
afford
one
proof
of
this
,
and
his
readiness
in
make
admission
which
could
scarcely
have
escape
the
lip
of
an
accomplice
,
certainly
appear
to
furnish
another
.
  
<EOS>
for
example
,
in
the
course
of
the
introductory
conversation
which
take
place
,
he
inform
Miss
Halcombe
that
Anne
Catherick
have
be
bring
back
to
him
with
the
necessary
order
and
certificate
by
Count
Fosco
on
the
twenty
-
seventh
of
July
 
the
Count
also
produce
a
letter
of
explanation
and
instruction
sign
by
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
on
receive
his
inmate
again
,
the
proprietor
of
the
Asylum
acknowledge
that
he
have
observe
some
curious
personal
change
in
her
.
<EOS>
such
change
no
doubt
be
not
without
precedent
in
his
experience
of
person
mentally
afflict
.
<EOS>
insane
people
be
often
at
one
time
,
outwardly
as
well
as
inwardly
,
unlike
what
they
be
at
another
 
the
change
from
better
to
bad
,
or
from
bad
to
better
,
in
the
madness
have
a
necessary
tendency
to
produce
alteration
of
appearance
externally
.
<EOS>
He
allow
for
these
,
and
he
allow
also
for
the
modification
in
the
form
of
Anne
Catherick
's
delusion
,
which
be
reflect
no
doubt
in
her
manner
and
expression
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
still
perplex
at
time
by
certain
difference
between
his
patient
before
she
have
escape
and
his
patient
since
she
have
be
bring
back
.
<EOS>
those
difference
be
too
minute
to
be
describe
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
say
of
course
that
she
be
absolutely
alter
in
height
or
shape
or
complexion
,
or
in
the
colour
of
her
hair
and
eye
,
or
in
the
general
form
of
her
face
 
<EOS>
the
change
be
something
that
he
feel
more
than
something
that
he
see
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
case
have
be
a
puzzle
from
the
first
,
and
one
more
perplexity
be
add
to
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
say
that
this
conversation
lead
to
the
result
of
even
partially
prepare
Miss
Halcombe
's
mind
for
what
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
but
it
produce
,
nevertheless
,
a
very
serious
effect
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
completely
unnerved
by
it
,
that
some
little
time
elapse
before
she
could
summon
composure
enough
to
follow
the
proprietor
of
the
Asylum
to
that
part
of
the
house
in
which
the
inmate
be
confine
.
  
<EOS>
on
inquiry
,
it
turn
out
that
the
suppose
Anne
Catherick
be
then
take
exercise
in
the
ground
attach
to
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
nurse
volunteer
to
conduct
Miss
Halcombe
to
the
place
,
the
proprietor
of
the
Asylum
remain
in
the
house
for
a
few
minute
to
attend
to
a
case
which
require
his
service
,
and
then
engage
to
join
his
visitor
in
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
the
nurse
lead
Miss
Halcombe
to
a
distant
part
of
the
property
,
which
be
prettily
lay
out
,
and
after
look
about
her
a
little
,
turn
into
a
turf
walk
,
shade
by
a
shrubbery
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
about
half
-
way
down
this
walk
two
woman
be
slowly
approach
.
<EOS>
the
nurse
point
to
them
and
say
,
"
there
be
Anne
Catherick
,
madam
,
with
the
attendant
who
wait
on
her
.
<EOS>
the
attendant
will
answer
any
question
you
wish
to
put
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
those
word
the
nurse
leave
her
to
return
to
the
duty
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
advance
on
her
side
,
and
the
woman
advance
on
theirs
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
within
a
dozen
pace
of
each
other
,
one
of
the
woman
stop
for
an
instant
,
look
eagerly
at
the
strange
lady
,
shake
off
the
nurse
's
grasp
on
her
,
and
the
next
moment
rush
into
Miss
Halcombe
's
arm
.
<EOS>
in
that
moment
Miss
Halcombe
recognise
her
sister
 
recognise
the
dead
-
alive
.
  
<EOS>
fortunately
for
the
success
of
the
measure
take
subsequently
,
no
one
be
present
at
that
moment
but
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
young
woman
,
and
she
be
so
startled
that
she
be
at
first
quite
incapable
of
interfere
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
able
to
do
so
her
whole
service
be
require
by
Miss
Halcombe
,
who
have
for
the
moment
sink
altogether
in
the
effort
to
keep
her
own
sense
under
the
shock
of
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
after
wait
a
few
minute
in
the
fresh
air
and
the
cool
shade
,
her
natural
energy
and
courage
help
her
a
little
,
and
she
become
sufficiently
mistress
of
herself
to
feel
the
necessity
of
recall
her
presence
of
mind
for
her
unfortunate
sister
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
She
obtain
permission
to
speak
alone
with
the
patient
,
on
condition
that
they
both
remain
well
within
the
nurse
's
view
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
time
for
question
 
there
be
only
time
for
Miss
Halcombe
to
impress
on
the
unhappy
lady
the
necessity
of
control
herself
,
and
to
assure
her
of
immediate
help
and
rescue
if
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
escape
from
the
Asylum
by
obedience
to
her
sister
's
direction
be
sufficient
to
quiet
Lady
Glyde
,
and
to
make
her
understand
what
be
require
of
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
next

to
the
nurse

place
all
the
gold

then
have
in
her
pocket
(
three
sovereign

and
where
she
could
speak
to
her
alone
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman

at
first
surprised
and
distrustful
.
<EOS>
but
on
Miss
Halcombe
's
declare
that
she
only
want
to
put
some
question
which
she
be
too
much
agitate
to
ask
at
that
moment
,
and
that
she
have
no
intention
of
mislead
the
nurse
into
any
dereliction
of
duty
,
the
woman
take
the
money
,
and
propose
three
o'clock
on
the
next
day
as
the
time
for
the
interview
.
<EOS>
She
may
then
slip
out
for
half
an
hour
,
after

,
and
she
would
meet
the

in
a
retired

,
outside

,
and
to

very
little

<EOS>
the
nurse
have
dress
Lady
Glyde
,
with
excellent
forethought
,
in
a
bonnet
,
veil
,
and
shawl
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
only
detain
her
to
suggest
a
means
of
turn
the
pursuit
in
a
false
direction
,
when
the
escape
be
discover
at
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
go
back
to
the
house
,
to
mention
in
the
hearing
of
the
other
nurse
that
Anne
Catherick
have
be
inquire
latterly
about
the
distance
from
London
to
Hampshire
,
to
wait
till
the
last
moment
,
before
discovery
be
inevitable
,
and
then
to
give
the
alarm
that
Anne
be
miss
.
<EOS>
the
suppose
inquiry
about
Hampshire
,
when
communicate
to
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
,
would
lead
him
to
imagine
that
his
patient
have
return
to
Blackwater
Park
,
under
the
influence
of
the
delusion
which
make
her
persist
in
assert
herself
to
be
Lady
Glyde
,
and
the
first
pursuit
would
,
in
all
probability
,
be
turn
in
that
direction
.
  
<EOS>
the
nurse
consent
to
follow
these
suggestion
,
the
more
readily
as
they
offer
her
the
mean
of
secure
herself
against
any
bad
consequence
than
the
loss
of
her
place
,
by
remain
in
the
Asylum
,
and
so
maintain
the
appearance
of
innocence
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
She
at
once
return
to
the
house
,
and
Miss
Halcombe
lose
no
time
in
take
her
sister
back
with
her
to
London
.
<EOS>
They
catch
the
afternoon
train
to
Carlisle
the
same
afternoon
,
and
arrive
at
Limmeridge
,
without
accident
or
difficulty
of
any
kind
,
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
latter
part
of
their
journey
they
be
alone
in
the
carriage
,
and
Miss
Halcombe
be
able
to
collect
such
remembrance
of
the
past
as
her
sister
's
confused
and
weakened
memory
be
able
to
recall
.
<EOS>
the
terrible
story
of
the
conspiracy
so
obtain
be
present
in
fragment
,
sadly
incoherent
in
themselves
,
and
widely
detach
from
each
other
.
<EOS>
imperfect
as
the
revelation
be
,
it
must
nevertheless
be
record
here
before
this
explanatory
narrative
close
with
the
event
of
the
next
day
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
's
recollection
of
the
event
which
follow
her
departure
from
Blackwater
Park
begin
with
her
arrival
at
the
London
terminus
of
the
South
Western
Railway
.
<EOS>
She
have
omit
to
make
a
memorandum
beforehand
of
the
day
on
which
she
take
the
journey
.
<EOS>
all
hope
of
fix
that
important
date
by
any
evidence
of
hers
,
or
of
Mrs.
Michelson
's
,
must
be
give
up
for
lose
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
arrival
of
the
train
at
the
platform
Lady
Glyde
find
Count
Fosco
wait
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
the
carriage
door
as
soon
as
the
porter
could
open
it
.
<EOS>
the
train
be
unusually
crowd
,
and
there
be
great
confusion
in
get
the
luggage
.
<EOS>
some
person
whom
Count
Fosco
bring
with
him
procure
the
luggage
which
belong
to
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
It
be
mark
with
her
name
.
<EOS>
She
drive
away
alone
with
the
Count
in
a
vehicle
which
she
do
not
particularly
notice
at
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
Her
first
question
,
on
leave
the
terminus
,
refer
to
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
the
Count
inform
her
that
Miss
Halcombe
have
not
yet
go
to
Cumberland
,
after
-
consideration
have
cause
him
to
doubt
the
prudence
of
her
take
so
long
a
journey
without
some
day
'
previous
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
next
inquire
whether
her
sister
be
then
stay
in
the
Count
's
house
.
<EOS>
Her
recollection
of
the
answer
be
confused
,
her
only
distinct
impression
in
relation
to
it
be
that
the
Count
declare
he
be
then
take
her
to
see
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
's
experience
of
London
be
so
limited
that
she
could
not
tell
,
at
the
time
,
through
what
street
they
be
drive
.
<EOS>
but
they
never
leave
the
street
,
and
they
never
pass
any
garden
or
tree
.
<EOS>
when
the
carriage
stop
,
it
stop
in
a
small
street
behind
a
square
 
a
square
in
which
there
be
shop
,
and
public
building
,
and
many
people
.
<EOS>
from
these
recollection
(
of
which
Lady
Glyde
be
certain
)
<EOS>
it
seem
quite
clear
that
Count
Fosco
do
not
take
her
to
his
own
residence
in
the
suburb
of
St.
John
's
Wood
.
  
<EOS>
They
enter
the
house
,
and
go
upstairs
to
a
back
room
,
either
on
the
first
or
second
floor
.
<EOS>
the
luggage
be
carefully
bring
in
.
<EOS>
a
female
servant
open
the
door
,
and
a
man
with
a
dark
beard
,
apparently
a
foreigner
,
meet
them
in
the
hall
,
and
with
great
politeness
show
them
the
way
upstairs
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
Lady
Glyde
's
inquiry
,
the
Count
assure
her
that
Miss
Halcombe
be
in
the
house
,
and
that
she
should
be
immediately
inform
of
her
sister
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
He
and
the
foreigner
then
go
away
and
leave
her
by
herself
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
poorly
furnish
as
a
sitting
-
room
,
and
it
look
out
on
the
back
of
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
place
be
remarkably
quiet
 
<EOS>
no
footstep
go
up
or
down
the
stair
 
<EOS>
she
only
hear
in
the
room
beneath
her
a
dull
,
rumble
sound
of
man
's
voice
talk
.
<EOS>
before
she
have
be
long
leave
alone
the
Count
return
,
to
explain
that
Miss
Halcombe
be
then
take
rest
,
and
could
not
be
disturb
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
He
be
accompany
into
the
room
by
a
gentleman
(
an
Englishman
)
,
whom
he
beg
to
present
as
a
friend
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
singular
introduction
 
in
the
course
of
which
no
name
,
to
the
good
of
Lady
Glyde
's
recollection
,
have
be
mention
 
she
be
leave
alone
with
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
He
be
perfectly
civil
,
but
he
startle
and
confuse
her
by
some
odd
question
about
herself
,
and
by
look
at
her
,
while
he
ask
them
,
in
a
strange
manner
.
<EOS>
after
remain
a
short
time
he
go
out
,
and
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
a
second
stranger
 
also
an
Englishman
 
come
in
.
<EOS>
this
person
introduce
himself
as
another
friend
of
Count
Fosco
's
,
and
he
,
in
his
turn
,
look
at
her
very
oddly
,
and
ask
some
curious
question
 
never
,
as
well
as
she
could
remember
,
address
her
by
name
,
and
go
out
again
,
after
a
little
while
,
like
the
first
man
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
she
be
so
frightened
about
herself
,
and
so
uneasy
about
her
sister
,
that
she
have
thought
of
venture
downstairs
again
,
and
claim
the
protection
and
assistance
of
the
only
woman
she
have
see
in
the
house
 
<EOS>
the
servant
who
answer
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
she
have
rise
from
her
chair
,
the
Count
come
back
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
he
appear
she
ask
anxiously
how
long
the
meeting
between
her
sister
and
herself
be
to
be
still
delay
.
<EOS>
at
first
he
return
an
evasive
answer
,
but
on
be
press
,
he
acknowledge
,
with
great
apparent
reluctance
,
that
Miss
Halcombe
be
by
no
means
so
well
as
he
have
hitherto
represent
her
to
be
.
<EOS>
His
tone
and
manner
,
in
make
this
reply
,
so
alarm
Lady
Glyde
,
or
rather
so
painfully
increase
the
uneasiness
which
she
have
feel
in
the
company
of
the
two
stranger
,
that
a
sudden
faintness
overcome
her
,
and
she
be
oblige
to
ask
for
a
glass
of
water
.
<EOS>
the
Count
call
from
the
door
for
water
,
and
for
a
bottle
of
smell
-
salts
.
<EOS>
both
be
bring
in
by
the
foreign
-
looking
man
with
the
beard
.
<EOS>
the
water
,
when
Lady
Glyde
attempt
to
drink
it
,
have
so
strange
a
taste
that
it
increase
her
faintness
,
and
she
hastily
take
the
bottle
of
salt
from
Count
Fosco
,
and
smell
at
it
.
<EOS>
Her
head
become
giddy
on
the
instant
.
<EOS>
the
Count
catch
the
bottle
as
it
drop
out
of
her
hand
,
and
the
last
impression
of
which
she
be
conscious
be
that
he
hold
it
to
her
nostril
again
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
point
her
recollection
be
find
to
be
confuse
,
fragmentary
,
and
difficult
to
reconcile
with
any
reasonable
probability
.
  
<EOS>
Her
own
impression
be
that
she
recover
her
sense
later
in
the
evening
,
that
she
then
leave
the
house
,
that
she
go
(
as
she
have
previously
arrange
to
go
,
at
Blackwater
Park
)
to
Mrs.
Vesey
's
 
that
she
drink
tea
there
,
and
that
she
pass
the
night
under
Mrs.
Vesey
's
roof
.
<EOS>
She
be
totally
unable
to
say
how
,
or
when
,
or
in
what
company
she
leave
the
house
to
which
Count
Fosco
have
bring
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
persist
in
assert
that
she
have
be
to
Mrs.
Vesey
's
,
and
still
more
extraordinary
,
that
she
have
be
help
to
undress
and
get
to
bed
by
Mrs.
Rubelle
!
<EOS>
She
could
not
remember
what
the
conversation
be
at
Mrs.
Vesey
's
or
whom
she
see
there
besides
that
lady
,
or
why
Mrs.
Rubelle
should
have
be
present
in
the
house
to
help
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
recollection
of
what
happen
to
her
the
next
morning
be
still
more
vague
and
unreliable
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
some
dim
idea
of
drive
out
(
at
what
hour
she
could
not
say
)
with
Count
Fosco
,
and
with
Mrs.
Rubelle
again
for
a
female
attendant
.
<EOS>
but
when
,
and
why
,
she
leave
Mrs.
Vesey
she
could
not
tell
;
neither
do
she
know
what
direction
the
carriage
drive
in
,
or
where
it
set
her
down
,
or
whether
the
Count
and
Mrs.
Rubelle
do
or
do
not
remain
with
her
all
the
time
she
be
out
.
<EOS>
at
this
point
in
her
sad
story
there
be
a
total
blank
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
impression
of
the
faint
kind
to
communicate
 
no
idea
whether
one
day
,
or
more
than
one
day
,
have
pass
 
until
she
come
to
herself
suddenly
in
a
strange
place
,
surround
by
woman
who
be
all
unknown
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
here
she
first
hear
herself
call
by
Anne
Catherick
's
name
,
and
here
,
as
a
last
remarkable
circumstance
in
the
story
of
the
conspiracy
,
her
own
eye
inform
her
that
she
have
Anne
Catherick
's
clothe
on
.
<EOS>
the
nurse
,
on
the
first
night
in
the
Asylum
,
have
show
her
the
mark
on
each
article
of
her
underclothing
as
it
be
take
off
,
and
have
say
,
not
at
all
irritably
or
unkindly
,
"
look
at
your
own
name
on
your
own
clothe
,
and
do
not
worry
us
all
any
more
about

Lady
Glyde

<EOS>
She
be
dead
and
bury

and
you
be
alive
and
hearty
.
<EOS>
do
look
at
your
clothe
now
!
<EOS>
there
it
be
,
in
good
marking
ink
,
and
there
you
will
find
it
on
all
your
old
thing
,
which
we
have
keep
in
the
house
 
Anne
Catherick
,
as
plain
as
print
!
"
<EOS>
and
there
it
be
,
when
Miss
Halcombe
examine
the
linen
her
sister
wear
,
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
only
recollection
 
all
of
them
uncertain
,
and
some
of
them
contradictory
 
which
could
be
extract
from
Lady
Glyde
by
careful
questioning
on
the
journey
to
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
abstain
from
press
her
with
any
inquiry
relate
to
event
in
the
Asylum
 
<EOS>
her
mind
be
but
too
evidently
unfit
to
bear
the
trial
of
revert
to
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
know
,
by
the
voluntary
admission
of
the
owner
of
the
mad
-
house
,
that
she
be
receive
there
on
the
twenty
-
seventh
of
July
.
<EOS>
from
that
date
until
the
fifteenth
of
October
(
the
day
of
her
rescue
)
<EOS>
she
have
be
under
restraint
,
her
identity
with
Anne
Catherick
systematically
assert
,
and
her
sanity
,
from
first
to
last
,
practically
deny
.
<EOS>
faculty
less
delicately
balance
,
constitution
less
tenderly
organise
,
must
have
suffer
under
such
an
ordeal
as
this
.
<EOS>
no
man
could
have
go
through
it
and
come
out
of
it
unchanged
.
  
<EOS>
arrive
at
Limmeridge
late
on
the
evening
of
the
fifteenth
,
Miss
Halcombe
wisely
resolve
not
to
attempt
the
assertion
of
Lady
Glyde
's
identity
until
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
<EOS>
she
go
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
room
,
and
use
all
possible
caution
and
preparation
beforehand
,
at
last
tell
him
in
so
many
word
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
his
first
astonishment
and
alarm
have
subside
,
he
angrily
declare
that
Miss
Halcombe
have
allow
herself
to
be
dupe
by
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
He
refer
her
to
Count
Fosco
's
letter
,
and
to
what
she
have
herself
tell
him
of
the
personal
resemblance
between
Anne
and
his
deceased
niece
,
and
he
positively
decline
to
admit
to
his
presence
,
even
for
one
minute
only
,
a
madwoman
,
whom
it
be
an
insult
and
an
outrage
to
have
bring
into
his
house
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
leave
the
room
 
wait
till
the
first
heat
of
her
indignation
have
pass
away
 
decide
on
reflection
that
Mr.
Fairlie
should
see
his
niece
in
the
interest
of
common
humanity
before
he
close
his
door
on
her
as
a
stranger
 
and
thereupon
,
without
a
word
of
previous
warning
,
take
Lady
Glyde
with
her
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
the
servant
be
post
at
the
door
to
prevent
their
entrance
,
but
Miss
Halcombe
insist
on
pass
him
,
and
make
her
way
into
Mr.
Fairlie
's
presence
,
lead
her
sister
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
scene
that
follow
,
though
it
only
last
for
a
few
minute
,
be
too
painful
to
be
describe
 
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
herself
shrink
from
refer
to
it
.
<EOS>
let
it
be
enough
to
say
that
Mr.
Fairlie
declare
,
in
the
most
positive
term
,
that
he
do
not
recognise
the
woman
who
have
be
bring
into
his
room
 
that
he
see
nothing
in
her
face
and
manner
to
make
him
doubt
for
a
moment
that
his
niece
lie
bury
in
Limmeridge
churchyard
,
and
that
he
would
call
on
the
law
to
protect
him
if
before
the
day
be
over
<EOS>
she
be
not
remove
from
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
take
the
very
bad
view
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
selfishness
,
indolence
,
and
habitual
want
of
feeling
,
it
be
manifestly
impossible
to
suppose
that
he
be
capable
of
such
infamy
as
secretly
recognise
and
openly
disown
his
brother
's
child
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
humanely
and
sensibly
allow
all
due
force
to
the
influence
of
prejudice
and
alarm
in
prevent
him
from
fairly
exercise
his
perception
,
and
account
for
what
have
happen
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
next
put
the
servant
to
the
test
,
and
find
that
they
too
be
,
in
every
case
,
uncertain
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
,
whether
the
lady
present
to
them
be
their
young
mistress
or
Anne
Catherick
,
of
whose
resemblance
to
her
they
have
all
hear
,
the
sad
conclusion
be
inevitable
that
the
change
produce
in
Lady
Glyde
's
face
and
manner
by
her
imprisonment
in
the
Asylum
be
far
more
serious
than
Miss
Halcombe
have
at
first
suppose
.
<EOS>
the
vile
deception
which
have
assert
her
death
defy
exposure
even
in
the
house
where
she
be
bear
,
and
among
the
people
with
whom
she
have
live
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
less
critical
situation
the
effort
nee
not
have
be
give
up
as
hopeless
even
yet
.
  
<EOS>
for
example
,
the
maid
,
Fanny
,
who
happen
to
be
then
absent
from
Limmeridge
,
be
expect
back
in
two
day
,
and
there
would
be
a
chance
of
gain
her
recognition
to
start
with
,
see
that
she
have
be
in
much
more
constant
communication
with
her
mistress
,
and
have
be
much
more
heartily
attach
to
her
than
the
other
servant
.
<EOS>
again
,
Lady
Glyde
may
have
be
privately
keep
in
the
house
or
in
the
village
to
wait
until
her
health
be
a
little
recovered
and
her
mind
be
a
little
steadied
again
.
<EOS>
when
her
memory
could
be
once
more
trust
to
serve
her
,
she
would
naturally
refer
to
person
and
event
in
the
past
with
a
certainty
and
a
familiarity
which
no
impostor
could
simulate
,
and
so
the
fact
of
her
identity
,
which
her
own
appearance
have
fail
to
establish
,
may
subsequently
be
prove
,
with
time
to
help
her
,
by
the
sure
test
of
her
own
word
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
circumstance
under
which
she
have
regain
her
freedom
render
all
recourse
to
such
mean
as
these
simply
impracticable
.
<EOS>
the
pursuit
from
the
Asylum
,
divert
to
Hampshire
for
the
time
only
,
would
infallibly
next
take
the
direction
of
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
the
person
appoint
to
seek
the
fugitive
may
arrive
at
Limmeridge
House
at
a
few
hour
'
notice
,
and
in
Mr.
Fairlie
's
present
temper
of
mind
they
may
count
on
the
immediate
exertion
of
his
local
influence
and
authority
to
assist
them
.
<EOS>
the
common
consideration
for
Lady
Glyde
's
safety
force
on
Miss
Halcombe
<EOS>
the
necessity
of
resign
the
struggle
to
do
her
justice
,
and
of
remove
her
at
once
from
the
place
of
all
other
that
be
now
most
dangerous
to
her
 
the
neighbourhood
of
her
own
home
.
  
<EOS>
an
immediate
return
to
London
be
the
first
and
wise
measure
of
security
which
suggest
itself
.
<EOS>
in
the
great
city
all
trace
of
them
may
be
most
speedily
and
most
surely
efface
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
preparation
to
make
 
no
farewell
word
of
kindness
to
exchange
with
any
one
.
<EOS>
on
the
afternoon
of
that
memorable
day
of
the
sixteenth
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
rouse
her
sister
to
a
last
exertion
of
courage
,
and
without
a
live
soul
to
wish
them
well
at
parting
,
the
two
take
their
way
into
the
world
alone
,
and
turn
their
back
for
ever
on
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
pass
the
hill
above
the
churchyard
,
when
Lady
Glyde
insist
on
turn
back
to
look
her
last
at
her
mother
's
grave
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
try
to
shake
her
resolution
,
but
,
in
this
one
instance
,
try
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
be
immovable
.
<EOS>
Her
dim
eye
light
with
a
sudden
fire
,
and
flash
through
the
veil
that
hang
over
them
 
her
waste
finger
strengthen
moment
by
moment
round
the
friendly
arm
by
which
they
have
hold
so
listlessly
till
this
time
.
<EOS>
I
believe
in
my
soul
that
the
hand
of
God
be
point
their
way
back
to
them
,
and
that
the
most
innocent
and
the
most
afflict
of
His
creature
be
choose
in
that
dread
moment
to
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
They
retrace
their
step
to
the
burial
-
ground
,
and
by
that
act
seal
the
future
of
our
three
life
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
the
story
of
the
past
 
the
story
so
far
as
we
know
it
then
.
  
<EOS>
two
obvious
conclusion
present
themselves
to
my
mind
after
hear
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
I
see
darkly
what
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
have
be
,
how
chance
have
be
watch
,
and
how
circumstance
have
be
handle
to
ensure
impunity
to
a
daring
and
an
intricate
crime
.
<EOS>
while
all
detail
be
still
a
mystery
to
me
,
the
vile
manner
in
which
the
personal
resemblance
between
the
woman
in
white
and
Lady
Glyde
have
be
turn
to
account
be
clear
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
Anne
Catherick
have
be
introduce
into
Count
Fosco
's
house
as
Lady
Glyde
 
<EOS>
it
be
plain
that
Lady
Glyde
have
take
the
dead
woman
's
place
in
the
Asylum
 
<EOS>
the
substitution
have
be
so
manage
as
to
make
innocent
people
(
the
doctor
and
the
two
servant
certainly
,
and
the
owner
of
the
mad
-
house
in
all
probability
)
accomplice
in
the
crime
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
conclusion
come
as
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
first
.
<EOS>
We
three
have
no
mercy
to
expect
from
Count
Fosco
and
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
the
success
of
the
conspiracy
have
bring
with
it
a
clear
gain
to
those
two
man
of
thirty
thousand
pound
 
twenty
thousand
to
one
,
ten
thousand
to
the
other
through
his
wife
.
<EOS>
They
have
that
interest
,
as
well
as
other
interest
,
in
ensure
their
impunity
from
exposure
,
and
they
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
,
no
sacrifice
unattempted
,
no
treachery
untrie
,
to
discover
the
place
in
which
their
victim
be
conceal
,
and
to
part
her
from
the
only
friend
she
have
in
the
world
 
Marian
Halcombe
and
myself
.
  
<EOS>
the
sense
of
this
serious
peril
 
<EOS>
a
peril
which
every
day
and
every
hour
may
bring
nearer
and
near
to
us
 
be
the
one
influence
that
guide
me
in
fix
the
place
of
our
retreat
.
<EOS>
I
choose
it
in
the
far
east
of
London
,
where
there
be
few
idle
people
to
lounge
and
look
about
them
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
I
choose
it
in
a
poor
and
a
populous
neighbourhood
 
because
the
hard
the
struggle
for
existence
among
the
man
and
woman
about
us
,
the
less
the
risk
of
their
have
the
time
or
take
the
pain
to
notice
chance
stranger
who
come
among
them
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
great
advantage
I
look
to
,
but
our
locality
be
a
gain
to
us
also
in
another
and
a
hardly
less
important
respect
.
<EOS>
We
could
live
cheaply
by
the
daily
work
of
my
hand
,
and
could
save
every
farthing
we
possess
to
forward
the
purpose
,
the
righteous
purpose
,
of
redress
an
infamous
wrong
 
which
,
from
first
to
last
,
I
now
keep
steadily
in
view
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
week
's
time
Marian
Halcombe
<EOS>
and
I
have
settle
how
the
course
of
our
new
life
should
be
direct
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
lodger
in
the
house
,
and
we
have
the
mean
of
go
in
and
out
without
pass
through
the
shop
.
<EOS>
I
arrange
,
for
the
present
at
least
,
that
neither
Marian
nor
Laura
should
stir
outside
the
door
without
my
be
with
them
,
and
that
in
my
absence
from
home
they
should
let
no
one
into
their
room
on
any
pretence
whatever
.
<EOS>
this
rule
establish
,
I
go
to
a
friend
whom
I
have
know
in
former
day
 
<EOS>
a
wood
engraver
in
large
practice
 
to
seek
for
employment
,
tell
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
have
reason
for
wish
to
remain
unknown
.
  
<EOS>
He
at
once
conclude
that
I
be
in
debt
,
express
his
regret
in
the
usual
form
,
and
then
promise
to
do
what
he
could
to
assist
me
.
<EOS>
I
leave
his
false
impression
undisturbed
,
and
accept
the
work
he
have
to
give
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
could
trust
my
experience
and
my
industry
.
<EOS>
I
have
what
he
want
,
steadiness
and
facility
,
and
though
my
earning
be
but
small
,
they
suffice
for
our
necessity
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
could
feel
certain
of
this
,
Marian
Halcombe
and
I
put
together
what
we
possess
.
<EOS>
She
have
between
two
and
three
hundred
pound
leave
of
her
own
property
,
and
I
have
nearly
as
much
remain
from
the
purchase
-
money
obtain
by
the
sale
of
my
drawing
-
master
's
practice
before
I
leave
England
.
<EOS>
together
we
make
up
between
us
more
than
four
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
I
deposit
this
little
fortune
in
a
bank
,
to
be
keep
for
the
expense
of
those
secret
inquiry
and
investigation
which
I
be
determined
to
set
on
foot
,
and
to
carry
on
by
myself
if
I
could
find
no
one
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
We
calculate
our
weekly
expenditure
to
the
last
farthing
,
and
we
never
touch
our
little
fund
except
in
Laura
's
interest
and
for
Laura
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
the
house
-
work
,
which
,
if
we
have
dare
trust
a
stranger
near
us
,
would
have
be
do
by
a
servant
,
be
take
on
the
first
day
,
take
as
her
own
right
,
by
Marian
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
woman
's
hand
are
fit
for
,
"
she
say
,
"
early
and
late
,
these
hand
of
mine
shall
do
.
"
<EOS>
They
tremble
as
she
hold
them
out
.
<EOS>
the
waste
arm
tell
their
sad
story
of
the
past
,
as
she
turn
up
the
sleeve
of
the
poor
plain
dress
that
she
wear
for
safety
's
sake
;
but
the
unquenchable
spirit
of
the
woman
burn
bright
in
her
even
yet
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
big
tear
rise
thick
in
her
eye
,
and
fall
slowly
over
her
cheek
as
she
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
She
dash
them
away
with
a
touch
of
her
old
energy
,
and
smile
with
a
faint
reflection
of
her
old
good
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
doubt
my
courage
,
Walter
,
"
she
plead
,
"
it
be
my
weakness
that
cry
,
not
me
.
<EOS>
the
house
-
work
shall
conquer
it
if
I
can
not
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
keep
her
word
 
<EOS>
the
victory
be
win
when
we
meet
in
the
evening
,
and
she
sit
down
to
rest
.
<EOS>
Her
large
steady
black
eye
look
at
me
with
a
flash
of
their
bright
firmness
of
bygone
day
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
quite
break
down
yet
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
worth
trust
with
my
share
of
the
work
.
<EOS>
"
before
I
could
answer
,
she
add
in
a
whisper
,
"
and
worth
trust
with
my
share
in
the
risk
and
the
danger
too
.
<EOS>
remember
that
,
if
the
time
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
remember
it
when
the
time
come
.
  
<EOS>
as
early
as
the
end
of
October
the
daily
course
of
our
life
have
assume
its
settle
direction
,
and
we
three
be
as
completely
isolate
in
our
place
of
concealment
as
if
the
house
we
live
in
have
be
a
desert
island
,
and
the
great
network
of
street
and
the
thousand
of
our
fellow
-
creature
all
round
us
the
water
of
an
illimitable
sea
.
<EOS>
I
could
now
reckon
on
some
leisure
time
for
consider
what
my
future
plan
of
action
should
be
,
and
how
I
may
arm
myself
most
securely
at
the
outset
for
the
come
struggle
with
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
I
give
up
all
hope
of
appeal
to
my
recognition
of
Laura
,
or
to
Marian
's
recognition
of
her
,
in
proof
of
her
identity
.
<EOS>
if
we
have
love
her
less
dearly
,
if
the
instinct
implant
in
us
by
that
love
have
not
be
far
more
certain
than
any
exercise
of
reasoning
,
far
keen
than
any
process
of
observation
,
even
we
may
have
hesitate
on
first
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
outward
change
work
by
the
suffering
and
the
terror
of
the
past
have
fearfully
,
almost
hopelessly
,
strengthen
the
fatal
resemblance
between
Anne
Catherick
and
herself
.
<EOS>
in
my
narrative
of
event
at
the
time
of
my
residence
in
Limmeridge
House
,
I
have
record
,
from
my
own
observation
of
the
two
,
how
the
likeness
,
strike
as
it
be
when
view
generally
,
fail
in
many
important
point
of
similarity
when
test
in
detail
.
<EOS>
in
those
former
day
,
if
they
have
both
be
see
together
side
by
side
,
no
person
could
for
a
moment
have
mistake
them
one
for
the
other
 
as
have
happen
often
in
the
instance
of
twin
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
say
this
now
.
<EOS>
the
sorrow
and
suffering
which
I
have
once
blame
myself
for
associate
even
by
a
pass
thought
with
the
future
of
Laura
Fairlie
,
have
set
their
profaning
mark
on
the
youth
and
beauty
of
her
face
;
and
the
fatal
resemblance
which
I
have
once
see
and
shudder
at
see
,
in
idea
only
,
be
now
a
real
and
living
resemblance
which
assert
itself
before
my
own
eye
.
<EOS>
stranger
,
acquaintance
,
friend
even
who
could
not
look
at
her
as
we
look
,
if
she
have
be
show
to
them
in
the
first
day
of
her
rescue
from
the
Asylum
,
may
have
doubt
if
she
be
the
Laura
Fairlie
they
have
once
see
,
and
doubt
without
blame
.
  
<EOS>
the
one
remain
chance
,
which
I
have
at
first
thought
may
be
trust
to
serve
us
 
<EOS>
the
chance
of
appeal
to
her
recollection
of
person
and
event
with
which
no
impostor
could
be
familiar
,
be
prove
,
by
the
sad
test
of
our
later
experience
,
to
be
hopeless
.
<EOS>
every
little
caution
that
Marian
and
I
practise
towards
her
 
every
little
remedy
we
try
,
to
strengthen
and
steady
slowly
the
weaken
,
shaken
faculty
,
be
a
fresh
protest
in
itself
against
the
risk
of
turn
her
mind
back
on
the
troubled
and
the
terrible
past
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
event
of
former
day
which
we
venture
on
encourage
her
to
recall
be
the
little
trivial
domestic
event
of
that
happy
time
at
Limmeridge
,
when
I
first
go
there
and
teach
her
to
draw
.
<EOS>
the
day
when
I
rouse
those
remembrance
by
show
her
the
sketch
of
the
summer
-
house
which
she
have
give
me
on
the
morning
of
our
farewell
,
and
which
have
never
be
separate
from
me
since
,
be
the
birthday
of
our
first
hope
.
<EOS>
tenderly
and
gradually
,
the
memory
of
the
old
walk
and
drive
dawn
upon
her
,
and
the
poor
weary
pining
eye
look
at
Marian
and
at
me
with
a
new
interest
,
with
a
falter
thoughtfulness
in
them
,
which
from
that
moment
we
cherish
and
keep
alive
.
<EOS>
I
buy
her
a
little
box
of
colour
,
and
a
sketch
-
book
like
the
old
sketch
-
book
which
I
have
see
in
her
hand
on
the
morning
that
we
first
meet
.
<EOS>
once
again
 
<EOS>
oh
me
,
once
again
!
 
<EOS>
at
spare
hour
save
from
my
work
,
in
the
dull
London
light
,
in
the
poor
London
room
,
I
sit
by
her
side
to
guide
the
falter
touch
,
to
help
the
feeble
hand
.
<EOS>
day
by
day
I
raise
and
raise
the
new
interest
till
its
place
in
the
blank
of
her
existence
be
at
last
assure
 
till
she
could
think
of
her
drawing
and
talk
of
it
,
and
patiently
practise
it
by
herself
,
with
some
faint
reflection
of
the
innocent
pleasure
in
my
encouragement
,
the
grow
enjoyment
in
her
own
progress
,
which
belong
to
the
lost
life
and
the
lost
happiness
of
past
day
.
  
<EOS>
We
help
her
mind
slowly
by
this
simple
mean
,
we
take
her
out
between
us
to
walk
on
fine
day
,
in
a
quiet
old
City
square
near
at
hand
,
where
there
be
nothing
to
confuse
or
alarm
her
 
<EOS>
we
spare
a
few
pound
from
the
fund
at
the
banker
's
to
get
her
wine
,
and
the
delicate
strengthen
food
that
she
require
 
we
amuse
her
in
the
evening
with
child
's
game
at
card
,
with
scrap
-
book
full
of
print
which
I
borrow
from
the
engraver
who
employ
me
 
by
these
,
and
other
trifle
attention
like
them
<EOS>
,
we
compose
her
and
steady
her
,
and
hope
all
thing
,
as
cheerfully
as
we
could
from
time
and
care
,
and
love
that
never
neglect
and
never
despair
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
to
take
her
mercilessly
from
seclusion
and
repose
 
to
confront
her
with
stranger
,
or
with
acquaintance
who
be
little
well
than
stranger
 
to
rouse
the
painful
impression
of
her
past
life
which
we
have
so
carefully
hush
to
rest
 
this
,
even
in
her
own
interest
,
we
dare
not
do
.
<EOS>
whatever
sacrifice
it
cost
,
whatever
long
,
weary
,
heartbreake
delay
it
involve
,
the
wrong
that
have
be
inflict
on
her
,
if
mortal
mean
could
grapple
it
,
must
be
redress
without
her
knowledge
and
without
her
help
.
  
<EOS>
this
resolution
settle
,
it
be
next
necessary
to
decide
how
the
first
risk
should
be
venture
,
and
what
the
first
proceeding
should
be
.
  
<EOS>
after
consult
with
Marian
,
I
resolve
to
begin
by
gather
together
as
many
fact
as
could
be
collect
 
then
to
ask
the
advice
of
Mr.
Kyrle
(
whom
we
know
we
could
trust
)
,
and
to
ascertain
from
him
,
in
the
first
instance
,
if
the
legal
remedy
lie
fairly
within
our
reach
.
<EOS>
I
owe
it
to
Laura
's
interest
not
to
stake
her
whole
future
on
my
own
unaided
exertion
,
so
long
as
there
be
the
faint
prospect
of
strengthen
our
position
by
obtain
reliable
assistance
of
any
kind
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
source
of
information
to
which
I
apply
be
the
journal
keep
at
Blackwater
Park
by
Marian
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
there
be
passage
in
this
diary
relate
to
myself
which
she
think
it
best
that
I
should
not
see
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
she
read
to
me
from
the
manuscript
,
and
I
take
the
note
I
want
as
she
go
on
.
<EOS>
We
could
only
find
time
to
pursue
this
occupation
by
sit
up
late
at
night
.
<EOS>
three
night
be
devote
to
the
purpose
,
and
be
enough
to
put
me
in
possession
of
all
that
Marian
could
tell
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
proceeding
be
to
gain
as
much
additional
evidence
as
I
could
procure
from
other
people
without
exciting
suspicion
.
<EOS>
I
go
myself
to
Mrs.
Vesey
to
ascertain
if
Laura
's
impression
of
have
sleep
there
be
correct
or
not
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
,
from
consideration
for
Mrs.
Vesey
's
age
and
infirmity
,
and
in
all
subsequent
case
of
the
same
kind
from
consideration
of
caution
,
I
keep
our
real
position
a
secret
,
and
be
always
careful
to
speak
of
Laura
as
"
the
late
Lady
Glyde
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
's
answer
to
my
inquiry
only
confirm
the
apprehension
which
I
have
previously
feel
.
<EOS>
Laura
have
certainly
write
to
say
she
would
pass
the
night
under
the
roof
of
her
old
friend
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
never
be
near
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mind
in
this
instance
,
and
<EOS>
,
as
I
fear
,
in
other
instance
besides
,
confusedly
present
to
her
something
which
she
have
only
intend
to
do
in
the
false
light
of
something
which
she
have
really
do
.
<EOS>
the
unconscious
contradiction
of
herself
be
easy
to
account
for
in
this
way
 
but
it
be
likely
to
lead
to
serious
result
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
stumble
on
the
threshold
at
start
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
flaw
in
the
evidence
which
tell
fatally
against
us
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
next
ask
for
the
letter
which
Laura
have
write
to
Mrs.
Vesey
from
Blackwater
Park
,
it
be
give
to
me
without
the
envelope
,
which
have
be
throw
into
the
wastepaper
basket
,
and
long
since
destroy
.
<EOS>
in
the
letter
itself
no
date
be
mention
 
not
even
the
day
of
the
week
.
<EOS>
It
only
contain
these
line
:
 
"
Dearest
Mrs.
Vesey
,
I
be
in
sad
distress
and
anxiety
,
and
I
may
come
to
your
house
to
-
morrow
night
,
and
ask
for
a
bed
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
what
be
the
matter
in
this
letter
 
<EOS>
I
write
it
in
such
fear
of
be
find
out
that
I
can
fix
my
mind
on
nothing
.
<EOS>
pray
be
at
home
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
a
thousand
kiss
,
and
tell
you
everything
.
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
what
help
be
there
in
those
line
?
<EOS>
none
.
  
<EOS>
on
return
from
Mrs.
Vesey
's
,
I
instruct
Marian
to
write
(
observe
the
same
caution
which
I
practise
myself
)
to
Mrs.
Michelson
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
express
,
if
she
please
,
some
general
suspicion
of
Count
Fosco
's
conduct
,
and
she
be
to
ask
the
housekeeper
to
supply
us
with
a
plain
statement
of
event
,
in
the
interest
of
truth
.
<EOS>
while
we
be
wait
for
the
answer
,
which
reach
us
in
a
week
's
time
,
I
go
to
the
doctor
in
St.
John
's
Wood
,
introduce
myself
as
send
by
Miss
Halcombe
to
collect
,
if
possible
,
more
particular
of
her
sister
's
last
illness
than
Mr.
Kyrle
have
find
the
time
to
procure
.
<EOS>
by
Mr.
Goodricke
's
assistance
,
I
obtain
a
copy
of
the
certificate
of
death
,
and
an
interview
with
the
woman
(
Jane
Gould
)
who
have
be
employ
to
prepare
the
body
for
the
grave
.
<EOS>
through
this
person
I
also
discover
a
means
of
communicate
with
the
servant
,
Hester
Pinhorn
.
<EOS>
She
have
recently
leave
her
place
in
consequence
of
a
disagreement
with
her
mistress
,
and
she
be
lodge
with
some
people
in
the
neighbourhood
whom
Mrs.
Gould
know
.
<EOS>
in
the
manner
here
indicate
I
obtain
the
narrative
of
the
housekeeper
,
of
the
doctor
,
of
Jane
Gould
,
and
of
Hester
Pinhorn
,
exactly
as
they
be
present
in
these
page
.
  
<EOS>
furnish
with
such
additional
evidence
as
these
document
afford
,
I
consider
myself
to
be
sufficiently
prepared
for
a
consultation
with
Mr.
Kyrle
,
and
Marian
write
accordingly
to
mention
my
name
to
him
,
and
to
specify
the
day
and
hour
at
which
I
request
to
see
him
on
private
business
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
time
enough
in
the
morning
for
me
to
take
Laura
out
for
her
walk
as
usual
,
and
to
see
her
quietly
settle
at
her
drawing
afterwards
.
<EOS>
She
look
up
at
me
with
a
new
anxiety
in
her
face
as
I
rise
to
leave
the
room
,
and
her
finger
begin
to
toy
doubtfully
,
in
the
old
way
,
with
the
brush
and
pencil
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
tired
of
me
yet
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
go
away
because
you
be
tired
of
me
?
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
do
well
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
get
well
.
<EOS>
be
you
as
fond
of
me
,
Walter
as
you
use
to
be
,
now
I
be
so
pale
and
thin
,
and
so
slow
in
learn
to
draw
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
speak
as
a
child
may
have
speak
,
she
show
me
her
thought
as
a
child
may
have
show
them
.
<EOS>
I
wait
a
few
minute
longer
 
wait
to
tell
her
that
she
be
dearer
to
me
now
than
she
have
ever
be
in
the
past
time
.
<EOS>
"
try
to
get
well
again
,
"
I
say
,
encourage
the
new
hope
in
the
future
which
I
see
dawn
in
her
mind
,
"
try
to
get
well
again
,
for
Marian
's
sake
and
for
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
return
to
her
drawing
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
try
,
because
they
be
both
so
fond
of
me
.
"
<EOS>
She
suddenly
look
up
again
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
go
long
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
get
on
with
my
drawing
,
Walter
,
when
you
be
not
here
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
soon
be
back
,
my
darling
 
soon
be
back
to
see
how
you
be
get
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
voice
falter
a
little
in
spite
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
force
myself
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
time
,
then
,
for
part
with
the
self
-
control
which
may
yet
serve
me
in
my
need
before
the
day
be
out
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
open
the
door
,
I
beckon
to
Marian
to
follow
me
to
the
stair
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
prepare
her
for
a
result
which
I
feel
may
sooner
or
later
follow
my
show
myself
openly
in
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
,
in
all
probability
,
be
back
in
a
few
hour
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
you
will
take
care
,
as
usual
,
to
let
no
one
inside
the
door
in
my
absence
.
<EOS>
but
if
anything
happen
 
"
  
"
what
can
happen
?
<EOS>
"
she
interpose
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
tell
me
plainly
,
Walter
,
if
there
be
any
danger
,
and
I
shall
know
how
to
meet
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
only
danger
,
"
I
reply
,
"
be
that
Sir
Percival
Glyde
may
have
be
recall
to
London
by
the
news
of
Laura
's
escape
.
<EOS>
You
be
aware
that
he
have
me
watch
before
I
leave
England
,
and
that
he
probably
know
me
by
sight
,
although
I
do
not
know
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
lay
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
look
at
me
in
anxious
silence
.
<EOS>
I
see
she
understand
the
serious
risk
that
threaten
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
likely
,
"
I
say
,
"
that
I
shall
be
see
in
London
again
so
soon
,
either
by
Sir
Percival
himself
or
by
the
person
in
his
employ
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
barely
possible
that
an
accident
may
happen
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
you
will
not
be
alarm
if
I
fail
to
return
to
-
night
,
and
you
will
satisfy
any
inquiry
of
Laura
's
with
the
good
excuse
that
you
can
make
for
me
?
<EOS>
if
I
find
the
least
reason
to
suspect
that
I
be
watch
,
I
will
take
good
care
that
no
spy
follow
me
back
to
this
house
.
<EOS>
do
not
doubt
my
return
,
Marian
,
however
it
may
be
delay
 
and
fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
!
"
<EOS>
she
answer
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
regret
,
Walter
,
that
you
have
only
a
woman
to
help
you
.
"
<EOS>
She
pause
,
and
detain
me
for
a
moment
longer
.
<EOS>
"
take
care
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
press
my
hand
anxiously
 
"
take
care
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
leave
her
,
and
set
forth
to
pave
the
way
for
discovery
 
the
dark
and
doubtful
way
,
which
begin
at
the
lawyer
's
door
.
    
<EOS>
no
circumstance
of
the
slight
importance
happen
on
my
way
to
the
office
of
Messrs.
Gilmore
&
Kyrle
,
in
Chancery
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
while
my
card
be
be
take
in
to
Mr.
Kyrle
,
a
consideration
occur
to
me
which
I
deeply
regret
not
have
thought
of
before
.
<EOS>
the
information
derive
from
Marian
's
diary
make
it
a
matter
of
certainty
that
Count
Fosco
have
open
her
first
letter
from
Blackwater
Park
to
Mr.
Kyrle
,
and
have
,
by
mean
of
his
wife
,
intercept
the
second
.
<EOS>
He
be
therefore
well
aware
of
the
address
of
the
office
,
and
he
would
naturally
infer
that
if
Marian
want
advice
and
assistance
,
after
Laura
's
escape
from
the
Asylum
,
she
would
apply
once
more
to
the
experience
of
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
the
office
in
Chancery
Lane
be
the
very
first
place
which
he
and
Sir
Percival
would
cause
to
be
watch
,
and
if
the
same
person
be
choose
for
the
purpose
who
have
be
employ
to
follow
me
,
before
my
departure
from
England
,
the
fact
of
my
return
would
in
all
probability
be
ascertain
on
that
very
day
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
,
generally
,
of
the
chance
of
my
be
recognise
in
the
street
,
but
the
special
risk
connect
with
the
office
have
never
occur
to
me
until
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
now
to
repair
this
unfortunate
error
in
judgment
 
too
late
to
wish
that
I
have
make
arrangement
for
meet
the
lawyer
in
some
place
privately
appoint
beforehand
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
resolve
to
be
cautious
on
leave
Chancery
Lane
,
and
not
to
go
straight
home
again
under
any
circumstance
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
after
wait
a
few
minute
I
be
show
into
Mr.
Kyrle
's
private
room
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
pale
,
thin
,
quiet
,
self
-
possess
man
,
with
a
very
attentive
eye
,
a
very
low
voice
,
and
a
very
undemonstrative
manner
 
not
(
as
I
judge
)
ready
with
his
sympathy
where
stranger
be
concern
,
and
not
at
all
easy

a

<EOS>
if

himself

favourable

the
strength

case

good

"
before

I
ought

warn
you

the
short
statement

occupy
some
little
time

My

Halcombe

"
where
any
interest

be
concern

I

It
be
his

do
so

I

whether

He

not

<EOS>
His

the
period

<EOS>
while
we
be
exchange
these
few
preliminary
word
,
he
have
be
search
among
the
paper
before
him
,
and
he
now
produce
from
them
a
seal
letter
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
about
to
hand
the
letter
to
me
,
but
,
apparently
change
his
mind
,
he
place
it
by
itself
on
the
table
,
settle
himself
in
his
chair
,
and
silently
wait
to
hear
what
I
have
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
without
waste
a
moment
in
prefatory
word
of
any
sort
,
I
enter
on
my
narrative
,
and
put
him
in
full
possession
of
the
event
which
have
already
be
relate
in
these
page
.
  
<EOS>
Lawyer
as
he
be
to
the
very
marrow
of
his
bone
,
I
startle
him
out
of
his
professional
composure
.
<EOS>
expression
of
incredulity
and
surprise
,
which
he
could
not
repress
,
interrupt
me
several
time
before
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
persevere
,
however
,
to
the
end
,
and
as
soon
as
I
reach
it
,
boldly
ask
the
one
important
question
    
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
opinion
,
Mr.
Kyrle
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
too
cautious
to
commit
himself
to
an
answer
without
take
time
to
recover
his
self
-
possession
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
before
I
give
my
opinion
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
must
beg
permission
to
clear
the
ground
by
a
few
question
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
the
question
 
sharp
,
suspicious
,
unbelieve
question
,
which
clearly
show
me
,
as
they
proceed
,
that
he
think
I
be
the
victim
of
a
delusion
,
and
that
he
may
even
have
doubt
,
but
for
my
introduction
to
him
by
Miss
Halcombe
,
whether
I
be
not
attempt
the
perpetration
of
a
cunningly
-
design
fraud
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
believe
that
I
have
speak
the
truth
,
Mr.
Kyrle

<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
when
he
have
do
examine
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
far
as
your
own
conviction
be
concern
,
I
be
certain
you
have
speak
the
truth

he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
high
esteem
for
Miss
Halcombe
,

I
have
therefore
every
reason
to
respect
a
gentleman
whose
mediation
she
trust
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
I
will
even
go
farther
,
if
you
like
,
and
admit
,
for
courtesy
's
sake

for
argument
's
sake
,
that
the
identity
of
Lady
Glyde
as
a
live
person
be
a
proved
fact
to
Miss
Halcombe

yourself

you
come
to
me
for
a
legal
opinion

<EOS>
as
a
lawyer
,

as
a
lawyer
only
,
it
be
my
duty
to
tell
you
,
Mr.
Hartright

that
you
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
case

<EOS>
"
You
put
it
strongly
,
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
put
it
plainly
as
well
.
<EOS>
the
evidence
of
Lady
Glyde
's
death
be
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
clear
and
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
there
be
her
aunt
's
testimony
to
prove
that
she
come
to
Count
Fosco
's
house
,
that
she
fall
ill
,
and
that
she
die
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
testimony
of
the
medical
certificate
to
prove
the
death
,
and
to
show
that
it
take
place
under
natural
circumstance
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
fact
of
the
funeral
at
Limmeridge
,
and
there
be
the
assertion
of
the
inscription
on
the
tomb
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
case
you
want
to
overthrow
.
<EOS>
what
evidence
have
you
to
support
the
declaration
on
your
side
that
the
person
who
die
and
be
bury
be
not
Lady
Glyde
?
<EOS>
let
us
run
through
the
main
point
of
your
statement
and
see
what
they
be
worth
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
go
to
a
certain
private
Asylum
,
and
there
see
a
certain
female
patient
.
<EOS>
It
be
know
that
a
woman
name
Anne
Catherick
,
and
bear
an
extraordinary
personal
resemblance
to
Lady
Glyde
,
escape
from
the
Asylum
;
it
be
know
that
the
person
receive
there
last
July
be
receive
as
Anne
Catherick
bring
back
;
it
be
know
that
the
gentleman
who
bring
her
back
warn
Mr.
Fairlie
that
it
be
part
of
her
insanity
to
be
bent
on
personate
his
dead
niece
;
and
it
be
know
that
she
do
repeatedly
declare
herself
in
the
Asylum
(
where
no
one
believe
her
)
to
be
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
these
be
all
fact
.
<EOS>
what
have
you
to
set
against
them
?
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
's
recognition
of
the
woman
,
which
recognition
after
-
event
invalidate
or
contradict
.
<EOS>
do
Miss
Halcombe
assert
her
suppose
sister
's
identity
to
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
,
and
take
legal
mean
for
rescue
her
?
<EOS>
no
,
she
secretly
bribe
a
nurse
to
let
her
escape
.
<EOS>
when
the
patient
have
be
release
in
this
doubtful
manner
,
and
be
take
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
do
he
recognise
her
?
<EOS>
be
he
stagger
for
one
instant
in
his
belief
of
his
niece
's
death
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
do
the
servant
recognise
her
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
be
she
keep
in
the
neighbourhood
to
assert
her
own
identity
,
and
to
stand
the
test
of
further
proceeding
?
<EOS>
no
,
she
be
privately
take
to
London
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
you
have
recognise
her
also
,
but
you
be
not
a
relative
 
<EOS>
you
be
not
even
an
old
friend
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
the
servant
contradict
you
,
and
Mr.
Fairlie
contradict
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
the
suppose
Lady
Glyde
contradict
herself
.
<EOS>
She
declare
she
pass
the
night
in
London
at
a
certain
house
.
<EOS>
Your
own
evidence
show
that
she
have
never
be
near
that
house
,
and
your
own
admission
be
that
her
condition
of
mind
prevent
you
from
produce
her
anywhere
to
submit
to
investigation
,
and
to
speak
for
herself
.
<EOS>
I
pass
over
minor
point
of
evidence
on
both
side
to
save
time
,
and
I
ask
you
,
if
this
case
be
to
go
now
into
a
court
of
law
 
to
go
before
a
jury
,
bind
to
take
fact
as
they
reasonably
appear
 
<EOS>
where
be
your
proof
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
wait
and
collect
myself
before
I
could
answer
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
the
story
of
Laura
and
the
story
of
Marian
have
be
present
to
me
from
a
stranger
's
point
of
view
 
the
first
time
the
terrible
obstacle
that
lie
across
our
path
have
be
make
to
show
themselves
in
their
true
character
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
can
be
no
doubt
,
"
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
that
the
fact
,
as
you
have
state
them
,
appear
to
tell
against
us
,
but
 
"
  
"
but
you
think
those
fact
can
be
explain
away
,
"
interpose
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
tell
you
the
result
of
my
experience
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
when
an
english
jury
have
to
choose
between
a
plain
fact
on
the
surface
and
a
long
explanation
under
the
surface
,
it
always
take
the
fact
in
preference
to
the
explanation
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
Lady
Glyde
(
I
call
the
lady
you
represent
by
that
name
for
argument
's
sake
)
declare
she
have
sleep
at
a
certain
house
,
and
it
be
prove
that
she
have
not
sleep
at
that
house
.
<EOS>
You
explain
this
circumstance
by
enter
into
the
state
of
her
mind
,
and
deduce
from
it
a
metaphysical
conclusion
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
the
conclusion
be
wrong
 
<EOS>
I
only
say
that
the
jury
will
take
the
fact
of
her
contradict
herself
in
preference
to
any
reason
for
the
contradiction
that
you
can
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
be
it
not
possible
,
"
I
urge
,
"
by
dint
of
patience
and
exertion
,
to
discover
additional
evidence
?
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
and
I
have
a
few
hundred
pound
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
with
a
half
-
suppress
pity
,
and
shake
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
consider
the
subject
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
from
your
own
point
of
view
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
right
about
Sir
Percival
Glyde
and
Count
Fosco

I
do

every
imaginable
difficulty
would
be
throw
in
the
way
of
your
get
fresh
evidence

every
obstacle
of
litigation
would
be
raise
 
every
point
in
the
case
would
be
systematically

by
the
time
we
have
spend
our
thousand

the
final
result

.
<EOS>
She
have
be
cast
out
as
a
stranger
from
the
house
in
which
she
be
bear
 
a
lie
which
record
her
death
have
be
write
on
her
mother
's
tomb
 
and
there
be
two
man
,
alive
and
unpunished
,
who
be
responsible
for
it
.
<EOS>
that
house
shall
open
again
to
receive
her
in
the
presence
of
every
soul
who
follow
the
false
funeral
to
the
grave
 
that
lie
shall
be
publicly
erase
from
the
tombstone
by
the
authority
of
the
head
of
the
family
,
and
those
two
man
shall
answer
for
their
crime
to
me
,
though
the
justice
that
sit
in
tribunal
be
powerless
to
pursue
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
give
my
life
to
that
purpose
,
and
,
alone
as
I
stand
,
if
God
spare
me
,
I
will
accomplish
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
draw
back
towards
his
table
,
and
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
His
face
show
plainly
that
he
think
my
delusion
have
get
the
well
of
my
reason
,
and
that
he
consider
it
totally
useless
to
give
me
any
more
advice
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
each
keep
our
opinion
,
Mr.
Kyrle
,
"
I
say
,
"
<EOS>
and
we
must
wait
till
the
event
of
the
future
decide
between
us
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
I
be
much
oblige
to
you
for
the
attention
you
have
give
to
my
statement
.
<EOS>
You
have
show
me
that
the
legal
remedy
lie
,
in
every
sense
of
the
word
,
beyond
our
mean
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
produce
the
law
proof
,
and
we
be
not
rich
enough
to
pay
the
law
expense
.
<EOS>
It
be
something
gain
to
know
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
bow
and
walk
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
call
me
back
and
give
me
the
letter
which
I
have
see
him
place
on
the
table
by
itself
at
the
beginning
of
our
interview
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
come
by
post
a
few
day
ago
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
will
not
mind
deliver
it
?
<EOS>
pray
tell
Miss
Halcombe
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
sincerely
regret
be
,
thus
far
,
unable
to
help
her
,
except
by
advice
,
which
will
not
be
more
welcome
,
I
be
afraid
,
to
her
than
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
letter
while
he
be
speak
.
<EOS>
It
be
address
to
"
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
care
of
Messrs.
Gilmore
&
Kyrle
,
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>
"
the
handwriting
be
quite
unknown
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
on
leave
the
room
I
ask
one
last
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
happen
to
know
,
"
I
say
,
"
if
Sir
Percival
Glyde
be
still
in
Paris
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
return
to
London
,
"
reply
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
"
at
least
I
hear
so
from
his
solicitor
,
whom
I
meet
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
after
that
answer
I
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
on
leave
the
office
the
first
precaution
to
be
observe
be
to
abstain
from
attract
attention
by
stop
to
look
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
walk
towards
one
of
the
quietest
of
the
large
square
on
the
north
of
Holborn
,
then
suddenly
stop
and
turn
round
at
a
place
where
a
long
stretch
of
pavement
be
leave
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
man
at
the
corner
of
the
square
who
have
stop
also
,
and
who
be
stand
talk
together
.
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
reflection
I
turn
back
so
as
to
pass
them
.
<EOS>
one
move
as
I
come
near
,
and
turn
the
corner
lead
from
the
square
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
the
other
remain
stationary
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
as
I
pass
and
instantly
recognise
one
of
the
man
who
have
watch
me
before
I
leave
England
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
free
to
follow
my
own
instinct
,
I
should
probably
have
begin
by
speak
to
the
man
,
and
have
end
by
knock
him
down
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
bind
to
consider
consequence
.
<EOS>
if
I
once
place
myself
publicly
in
the
wrong
,
I
put
the
weapon
at
once
into
Sir
Percival
's
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
choice
but
to
oppose
cunning
by
cunne
.
<EOS>
I
turn
into
the
street
down
which
the
second
man
have
disappear
,
and
pass
him
,
wait
in
a
doorway
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
stranger
to
me
,
and
I
be
glad
to
make
sure
of
his
personal
appearance
in
case
of
future
annoyance
.
<EOS>
have
do
this
,
I
again
walk
northward
till
I
reach
the
New
Road
.
<EOS>
there
I
turn
aside
to
the
west
(
have
the
man
behind
me
all
the
time
)
,
and
wait
at
a
point
where
I
know
myself
to
be
at
some
distance
from
a
cab
-
stand
,
until
a
fast
two
-
wheel
cab
,
empty
,
should
happen
to
pass
me
.
<EOS>
one
pass
in
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
I
jump
in
and
tell
the
man
to
drive
rapidly
towards
Hyde
Park
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
second
fast
cab
for
the
spy
behind
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
them
dart
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
,
to
follow
me
by
run
,
until
a
cab
or
a
cab
-
stand
come
in
their
way
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
the
start
of
them
,
and
when
I
stop
the
driver
and
get
out
,
they
be
nowhere
in
sight
.
<EOS>
I
cross
Hyde
Park
and
make
sure
,
on
the
open
ground
,
that
I
be
free
.
<EOS>
when
I
at
last
turn
my
step
homeward
,
it
be
not
till
many
hour
later
 
not
till
after
dark
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
marian
wait
for
me
alone
in
the
little
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
have
persuade
Laura
to
go
to
rest
,
after
first
promising
to
show
me
her
draw
the
moment
I
come
in
.
<EOS>
the
poor
little
dim
faint
sketch
 
<EOS>
so
trifling
in
itself
,
so
touching
in
its
association
 
be
prop
up
carefully
on
the
table
with
two
book
,
and
be
place
where
the
faint
light
of
the
one
candle
we
allow
ourselves
may
fall
on
it
to
the
good
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
sit
down
to
look
at
the
drawing
,
and
to
tell
Marian
,
in
whisper
,
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
the
partition
which
divide
us
from
the
next
room
be
so
thin
that
we
could
almost
hear
Laura
's
breathing
,
and
we
may
have
disturb
her
if
we
have
speak
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
Marian
preserve
her
composure
while
I
describe
my
interview
with
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
but
her
face
become
troubled
when
I
speak
next
of
the
man
who
have
follow
me
from
the
lawyer
's
office
,
and
when
I
tell

His

on

point
confirm
my
own
.
<EOS>
We
must
persist
to
the
last
in
hunt
down
the
date
of
Laura
's
journey
.
<EOS>
the
one
weak
point
in
the
conspiracy
,
and
probably
the
one
chance
of
prove
that
she
be
a
live
woman
,
centre
in
the
discovery
of
that
date
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
,
"
say
Marian
,
"
the
discovery
that
Laura
do
not
leave
Blackwater
Park
till
after
the
date
of
her
death
on
the
doctor
's
certificate
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
make
you

it

be
after

<EOS>
Laura
can
tell
us
nothing
of
the
time
she
be
in
London
.

"
<EOS>
but
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
tell
you
that
she
be
receive
there
on
the
twenty
-
seventh
of
July
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
Count
Fosco
's
ability
to
keep
her
in
London
,
and
to
keep
her
insensible
to
all
that
be
pass
around
her
,
more
than
one
night
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
she
must
have
start
on
the
twenty
-
sixth
,
and
must
have
come
to
London
one
day
after
the
date
of
her
own
death
on
the
doctor
's
certificate
.
<EOS>
if
we
can
prove
that
date
,
we
prove
our
case
against
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
 
I
see
!
<EOS>
but
how
be
the
proof
to
be
obtain
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Michelson
's
narrative
have
suggest
to
me
two
way
of
try
to
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
be
to
question
the
doctor
,
Mr.
Dawson
,
who
must
know
when
he
resume
his
attendance
at
Blackwater
Park
after
Laura
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
other
be
to
make
inquiry
at
the
inn
to
which
Sir
Percival
drive
away
by
himself
at
night
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
his
departure
follow
Laura
's
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
hour
,
and
we
may
get
at
the
date
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
the
attempt
be
at
least
worth
make
,
and
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
be
determine
it
shall
be
make
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
suppose
it
fail
 
I
look
at
the
bad
now
,
Walter
;
but
I
will
look
at
the
good
if
disappointment
come
to
try
us
 
suppose
no
one
can
help
you
at
Blackwater
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
two
man
who
can
help
me
,

shall
help
me
in
London
 
Sir
Percival

<EOS>
innocent
people
may
well
forget
the
date
 
<EOS>

they
be
guilty
,
and
they
know
it

<EOS>
if
I
fail
everywhere
else

I
mean
to
force
a
confession
out
of
one

both
of
them

up

you

Walter

I

I
have

yes

the
Secret

It
be
our
only
sure
hold
on
him

<EOS>
I
can
force
him
from
his
position
of
security

I
can
drag
him
and
his
villainy
into
the
face
of
day

by
no

whatever
the

have
do

Sir

have
consent

the
conspiracy

another
motive

the

You
hear
him
tell
the

"
    
<EOS>
the
story
of
my
first
inquiry
in
Hampshire
be
soon
tell
.
  
<EOS>
My
early
departure
from
London
enable
me
to
reach
Mr.
Dawson
's
house
in
the
forenoon
.
<EOS>
Our
interview
,
so
far
as
the
object
of
my
visit
be
concern
,
lead
to
no
satisfactory
result
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
's
book
certainly
show
when
he
have
resume
his
attendance
on
Miss
Halcombe
at
Blackwater
Park
,
but
it
be
not
possible
to
calculate
back
from
this
date
with
any
exactness
,
without
such
help
from
Mrs.
Michelson
as
I
know
she
be
unable
to
afford
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
say
from
memory
(
who
,
in
similar
case
,
ever
can
?
)
<EOS>
how
many
day
have
elapse
between
the
renewal
of
the
doctor
's
attendance
on
his
patient
and
the
previous
departure
of
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
She
be
almost
certain
of
have
mention
the
circumstance
of
the
departure
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
on
the
day
after
it
happen
 
<EOS>
but
then
she
be
no
more
able
to
fix
the
date
of
the
day
on
which
this
disclosure
take
place
,
than
to
fix
the
date
of
the
day
before
,
when
Lady
Glyde
have
leave
for
London
.
<EOS>
neither
could
she
calculate
,
with
any
nearer
approach
to
exactness
,
the
time
that
have
pass
from
the
departure
of
her
mistress
,
to
the
period
when
the
undated
letter
from
Madame
Fosco
arrive
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
as
if
to
complete
the
series
of
difficulty
,
the
doctor
himself
,
have
be
ill
at
the
time
,
have
omit
to
make
his
usual
entry
of
the
day
of
the
week
and
month
when
the
gardener
from
Blackwater
Park
have
call
on
him
to
deliver
Mrs.
Michelson
's
message
.
  
<EOS>
hopeless
of
obtain
assistance
from
Mr.
Dawson
,
I
resolve
to
try
next
if
I
could
establish
the
date
of
Sir
Percival
's
arrival
at
Knowlesbury
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
like
a
fatality
!
<EOS>
when
I
reach
Knowlesbury
the
inn
be
shut
up
,
and
bill
be
post
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
the
speculation
have
be
a
bad
one
,
as
I
be
inform
,
ever
since
the
time
of
the
railway
.
<EOS>
the
new
hotel
at
the
station
have
gradually
absorb
the
business
,
and
the
old
inn
(
which
we
know
to
be
the
inn
at
which
Sir
Percival
have
put
up
)
,
have
be
close
about
two
month
since
.
<EOS>
the
proprietor
have
leave
the
town
with
all
his
good
and
chattel
,
and
where
he
have
go
<EOS>
I
could
not
positively
ascertain
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
the
four
people
of
whom
I
inquire
give
me
four
different
account
of
his
plan
and
project
when
he
leave
Knowlesbury
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
still
some
hour
to
spare
before
the
last
train
leave
for
London
,
and
I
drive
back
again
in
a
fly
from
the
Knowlesbury
station
to
Blackwater
Park
,
with
the
purpose
of
question
the
gardener
and
the
person
who
keep
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
if
they
,
too
,
prove
unable
to
assist
me
,
my
resource
for
the
present
be
at
an
end
,
and
I
may
return
to
town
.
  
<EOS>
I
dismiss
the
fly
a
mile
distant
from
the
park
,
and
get
my
direction
from
the
driver
,
proceed
by
myself
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
turn
into
the
lane
from
the
high
-
road
,
I
see
a
man
,
with
a
carpet
-
bag
,
walk
before
me
rapidly
on
the
way
to
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
man
,
dress
in
shabby
black
,
and
wear
a
remarkably
large
hat
.
<EOS>
I
set
him
down
(
as
well
as
it
be
possible
to
judge
)
for
a
lawyer
's
clerk
,
and
stop
at
once
to
widen
the
distance
between
us
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
hear
me
,
and
he
walk
on
out
of
sight
,
without
look
back
.
<EOS>
when
I
pass
through
the
gate
myself
,
a
little
while
afterwards
,
he
be
not
visible
 
he
have
evidently
go
on
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
woman
in
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
be
old
,
the
other
I
know
at
once
,
by
Marian
's
description
of
her
,
to
be
Margaret
Porcher
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
first
if
Sir
Percival
be
at
the
Park
,
and
receive
a
reply
in
the
negative
,
inquire
next
when
he
have
leave
it
.
<EOS>
neither
of
the
woman
could
tell
me
more
than
that
he
have
go
away
in
the
summer
.
<EOS>
I
could
extract
nothing
from
Margaret
Porcher
but
vacant
smile
and
shaking
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
the
old
woman
be
a
little
more
intelligent
,
and
I
manage
to
lead
her
into
speaking
of
the
manner
of
Sir
Percival
's
departure
,
and
of
the
alarm
that
it
cause
her
.
<EOS>
She
remember
her
master
call
her
out
of
bed
,
and
remember
his
frightening
her
by
swear
 
but
the
date
at
which
the
occurrence
happen
be
,
as
she
honestly
acknowledge
,
"
quite
beyond
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
leave
the
lodge
I
see
the
gardener
at
work
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
address
him
,
he
look
at
me
rather
distrustfully
,
but
on
my
use
Mrs.
Michelson
's
name
,
with
a
civil
reference
to
himself
,
he
enter
into
conversation
readily
enough
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
to
describe
what
pass
between
us
 
<EOS>
it
end
,
as
all
my
other
attempt
to
discover
the
date
have
end
.
<EOS>
the
gardener
know
that
his
master
have
drive
away
,
at
night
,
"
some
time
in
July
,
the
last
fortnight
or
the
last
ten
day
in
the
month
"
 
and
know
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
speak
together
<EOS>
I
see
the
man
in
black
,
with
the
large
hat
,
come
out
from
the
house
,
and
stand
at
some
little
distance
observe
us
.
  
<EOS>
certain
suspicion
of
his
errand
at
Blackwater
Park
have
already
cross
my
mind
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
increase
by
the
gardener
's
inability
(
or
unwillingness
)
to
tell
me
who
the
man
be
,
and
I
determine
to
clear
the
way
before
me
,
if
possible
,
by
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
plain
question
I
could
put
as
a
stranger
would
be
to
inquire
if
the
house
be
allow
to
be
show
to
visitor
.
<EOS>
I
walk
up
to
the
man
at
once
,
and
accost
him
in
those
word
.
  
<EOS>
His
look
and
manner
unmistakably
betray
that
he
know
who
I
be
,
and
that
he
want
to
irritate
me
into
quarrel
with
him
.
<EOS>
His
reply
be
insolent
enough
to
have
answer
the
purpose
,
if
I
have
be
less
determined
to
control
myself
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
meet
him
with
the
most
resolute
politeness
,
apologise
for
my
involuntary
intrusion
(
which
he
call
a
"
trespass
,
"
)
and
leave
the
ground
.
<EOS>
It
be
exactly
as
I
suspect
.
<EOS>
the
recognition
of
me
when
I
leave
Mr.
Kyrle
's
office
have
be
evidently
communicate
to
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
and
the
man
in
black
have
be
send
to
the
Park
in
anticipation
of
my
make
inquiry
at
the
house
or
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
give
him
the
least
chance
of
lodge
any
sort
of
legal
complaint
against
me
,
the
interference
of
the
local
magistrate
would
no
doubt
have
be
turn
to
account
as
a
clog
on
my
proceeding
,
and
a
means
of
separate
me
from
Marian
and
Laura
for
some
day
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
prepared
to
be
watch
on
the
way
from
Blackwater
Park
to
the
station
,
exactly
as
I
have
be
watch
in
London
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
discover
at
the
time
,
whether
I
be
really
follow
on
this
occasion
or
not
.
<EOS>
the
man
in
black
may
have
have
mean
of
track
me
at
his
disposal
of
which
I
be
not
aware
,
but
I
certainly
see
nothing
of
him
,
in
his
own
person
,
either
on
the
way
to
the
station
,
or
afterwards
on
my
arrival
at
the
London
terminus
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
reach
home
on
foot
,
take
the
precaution
,
before
I
approach
our
own
door
,
of
walk
round
by
the
lonely
street
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
there
stop
and
look
back
more
than
once
over
the
open
space
behind
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
first
learn
to
use
this
stratagem
against
suspect
treachery
in
the
wild
of
Central
America
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
practise
it
again
,
with
the
same
purpose
and
with
even
great
caution
,
in
the
heart
of
civilised
London
!
  
<EOS>
nothing
have
happen
to
alarm
Marian
during
my
absence
.
<EOS>
She
ask
eagerly
what
success
I
have
meet
with
.
<EOS>
when
I
tell
her
she
could
not
conceal
her
surprise
at
the
indifference
with
which
I
speak
of
the
failure
of
my
investigation
thus
far
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
the
ill
-
success
of
my
inquiry
have
in
no
sense
daunt
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
pursue
them
as
a
matter
of
duty
,
and
I
have
expect
nothing
from
them
.
<EOS>
in
the
state
of
my
mind
at
that
time
,
it
be
almost
a
relief
to
me
to
know
that
the
struggle
be
now
narrow
to
a
trial
of
strength
between
myself
and
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
the
vindictive
motive
have
mingle
itself
all
along
with
my
other
and
well
motive
,
and
I
confess
it
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
feel
that
the
sure
way
,
the
only
way
leave
,
of
serve
Laura
's
cause
,
be
to
fasten
my
hold
firmly
on
the
villain
who
have
marry
her
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
acknowledge
that
I
be
not
strong
enough
to
keep
my
motive
above
the
reach
of
this
instinct
of
revenge
,
I
can
honestly
say
something
in
my
own
favour
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
no
base
speculation
on
the
future
relation
of
Laura
and
myself
,
and
on
the
private
and
personal
concession
which
I
may
force
from
Sir
Percival
if
I
once
have
him
at
my
mercy
,
ever
enter
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
never
say
to
myself
,
"
if
I
do
succeed
,
it
shall
be
one
result
of
my
success
that
I
put
it
out
of
her
husband
's
power
to
take
her
from
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
look
at
her
and
think
of
the
future
with
such
thought
as
those
.
<EOS>
the
sad
sight
of
the
change
in
her
from
her
former
self
,
make
the
one
interest
of
my
love
an
interest
of
tenderness
and
compassion
which
her
father
or
her
brother
may
have
feel
,
and
which
I
feel
,
God
know
,
in
my
inmost
heart
.
<EOS>
all
my
hope
look
no
farther
on
now
than
to
the
day
of
her
recovery
.
<EOS>
there
,
till
she
be
strong
again
and
happy
again
 
there
,
till
she
could
look
at
me
as
she
have
once
look
,
and
speak
to
me
as
she
have
once
speak
 
the
future
of
my
happy
thought
and
my
dear
wish
end
.
  
<EOS>
these
word
be
write
under
no
prompting
of
idle
self
-
contemplation
.
<EOS>
passage
in
this
narrative
be
soon
to
come
which
will
set
the
mind
of
other
in
judgment
on
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
It
be
right
that
the
good
and
the
bad
of
me
should
be
fairly
balance
before
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
morning
after
my
return
from
Hampshire
I
take
marian
upstairs
into
my
working
-
room
,
and
there
lay
before
her
the
plan
that
I
have
mature
thus
far
,
for
master
the
one
assailable
point
in
the
life
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
the
way
to
the
Secret
lie
through
the
mystery
,
hitherto
impenetrable
to
all
of
us
,
of
the
woman
in
white
.
<EOS>
the
approach
to
that
in
its
turn
may
be
gain
by
obtain
the
assistance
of
Anne
Catherick
's
mother
,
and
the
only
ascertainable
mean
of
prevail
on
Mrs.
Catherick
to
act
or
to
speak
in
the
matter
depend
on
the
chance
of
my
discovering
local
particular
and
family
particular
first
of
all
from
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
after
think
the
subject
over
carefully
,
I
feel
certain
that
I
could
only
begin
the
new
inquiry
by
place
myself
in
communication
with
the
faithful
friend
and
protectress
of
Anne
Catherick
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
difficulty
then
be
to
find
Mrs.
Clements
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
indebte
to
Marian
's
quick
perception
for
meet
this
necessity
at
once
by
the
good
and
simple
mean
.
<EOS>
She
propose
to
write
to
the
farm
near
Limmeridge
(
Todd
's
Corner
)
,
to
inquire
whether
Mrs.
Clements
have
communicate
with
Mrs.
Todd
during
the
past
few
month
.
<EOS>
how
Mrs.
Clements
have
be
separate
from
Anne
it
be
impossible
for
us
to
say
,
but
that
separation
once
effect
,
it
would
certainly
occur
to
Mrs.
Clements
to
inquire
after
the
miss
woman
in
the
neighbourhood
of
all
other
to
which
she
be
know
to
be
most
attach
 
the
neighbourhood
of
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
I
see
directly
that
Marian
's
proposal
offer
us
a
prospect
of
success
,
and
she
write
to
Mrs.
Todd
accordingly
by
that
day
's
post
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
wait
for
the
reply
,
I
make
myself
master
of
all
the
information
Marian
could
afford
on
the
subject
of
Sir
Percival
's
family
,
and
of
his
early
life
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
speak
on
these
topic
from
hearsay
,
but
she
be
reasonably
certain
of
the
truth
of
what
little
she
have
to
tell
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
be
an
only
child
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
Sir
Felix
Glyde
,
have
suffer
from
his
birth
under
a
painful
and
incurable
deformity
,
and
have
shun
all
society
from
his
early
year
.
<EOS>
His
sole
happiness
be
in
the
enjoyment
of
music
,
and
he
have
marry
a
lady
with
taste
similar
to
his
own
,
who
be
say
to
be
a
most
accomplished
musician
.
<EOS>
He
inherit
the
Blackwater
property
while
still
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
neither
he
nor
his
wife
after
take
possession
,
make
advance
of
any
sort
towards
the
society
of
the
neighbourhood
,
and
no
one
endeavour
to
tempt
them
into
abandon
their
reserve
,
with
the
one
disastrous
exception
of
the
rector
of
the
parish
.
  
<EOS>
the
rector
be
the
bad
of
all
innocent
mischief
-
maker
 
an
over
-
zealous
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
that
Sir
Felix
have
leave
College
with
the
character
of
be
little
well
than
a
revolutionist
in
politics
and
an
infidel
in
religion
,
and
he
arrive
conscientiously
at
the
conclusion
that
it
be
his
bounden
duty
to
summon
the
lord
of
the
manor
to
hear
sound
view
enunciate
in
the
parish
church
.
<EOS>
Sir
Felix
fiercely
resent
the
clergyman
's
well
-
mean
but
ill
-
direct
interference
,
insult
him
so
grossly
and
so
publicly
,
that
the
family
in
the
neighbourhood
send
letter
of
indignant
remonstrance
to
the
Park
,
and
even
the
tenant
of
the
Blackwater
property
express
their
opinion
as
strongly
as
they
dare
.
<EOS>
the
baronet
,
who
have
no
country
taste
of
any
kind
,
and
no
attachment
to
the
estate
or
to
any
one
live
on
it
,
declare
that
society
at
Blackwater
should
never
have
a
second
chance
of
annoy
him
,
and
leave
the
place
from
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
residence
in
London
he
and
his
wife
depart
for
the
continent
,
and
never
return
to
England
again
.
<EOS>
They
live
part
of
the
time
in
France
and
part
in
Germany
 
always
keep
themselves
in
the
strict
retirement
which
the
morbid
sense
of
his
own
personal
deformity
have
make
a
necessity
to
Sir
Felix
.
<EOS>
Their
son
,
Percival
,
have
be
bear
abroad
,
and
have
be
educate
there
by
private
tutor
.
<EOS>
His
mother
be
the
first
of
his
parent
whom
he
lose
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
die
a
few
year
after
her
,
either
in
1825
or
1826
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
have
be
in
England
,
as
a
young
man
,
once
or
twice
before
that
period
,
but
his
acquaintance
with
the
late
Mr.
Fairlie
do
not
begin
till
after
the
time
of
his
father
's
death
.
<EOS>
They
soon
become
very
intimate
,
although
Sir
Percival
be
seldom
,
or
never
,
at
Limmeridge
House
in
those
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Frederick
Fairlie
may
have
meet
him
once
or
twice
in
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
's
company
,
but
he
could
have
know
little
of
him
at
that
or
at
any
other
time
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
only
intimate
friend
in
the
Fairlie
family
have
be
Laura
's
father
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
all
the
particular
that
I
could
gain
from
Marian
.
<EOS>
They
suggest
nothing
which
be
useful
to
my
present
purpose
,
but
I
note
them
down
carefully
,
in
the
event
of
their
proving
to
be
of
importance
at
any
future
period
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Todd
's
reply
(
address
,
by
our
own
wish
,
to
a
post
-
office
at
some
distance
from
us
)
have
arrive
at
its
destination
when
I
go
to
apply
for
it
.
<EOS>
the
chance
,
which
have
be
all
against
us
hitherto
,
turn
from
this
moment
in
our
favour
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Todd
's
letter
contain
the
first
item
of
information
of
which
we
be
in
search
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
,
it
appear
,
have
(
as
we
have
conjecture
)
write
to
Todd
's
Corner
,
ask
pardon
in
the
first
place
for
the
abrupt
manner
in
which
she
and
Anne
have
leave
their
friend
at
the
farm
-
house
(
on
the
morning
after
I
have
meet
the
woman
in
white
in
Limmeridge
churchyard
)
,
and
then
inform
Mrs.
Todd
of
Anne
's
disappearance
,
and
entreat
that
she
would
cause
inquiry
to
be
make
in
the
neighbourhood
,
on
the
chance
that
the
lost
woman
may
have
stray
back
to
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
in
make
this
request
,
Mrs.
Clements
have
be
careful
to
add
to
it
the
address
at
which
she
may
always
be
hear
of
,
and
that
address
Mrs.
Todd
now
transmit
to
Marian
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
London
,
and
within
half
an
hour
's
walk
of
our
own
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
word
of
the
proverb
,
I
be
resolve
not
to
let
the
grass
grow
under
my
foot
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
I
set
forth
to
seek
an
interview
with
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
this
be
my
first
step
forward
in
the
investigation
.
<EOS>
the
story
of
the
desperate
attempt
to
which
I
now
stand
committed
begin
here
.
    
<EOS>
the
address
communicate
by
Mrs.
Todd
take
me
to
a
lodging
-
house
situate
in
a
respectable
street
near
the
Gray
's
Inn
Road
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
knock
the
door
be
open
by
Mrs.
Clements
herself
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
appear
to
remember
me
,
and
ask
what
my
business
be
.
<EOS>
I
recall
to
her
our
meeting
in
Limmeridge
churchyard
at
the
close
of
my
interview
there
with
the
woman
in
white
,
take
special
care
to
remind
her
that
I
be
the
person
who
assist
Anne
Catherick
(
as
Anne
have
herself
declare
)
to
escape
the
pursuit
from
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
this
be
my
only
claim
to
the
confidence
of
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
She
remember
the
circumstance
the
moment
I
speak
of
it
,
and
ask
me
into
the
parlour
,
in
the
great
anxiety
to
know
if
I
have
bring
her
any
news
of
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
tell
her
the
whole
truth
without
,
at
the
same
time
,
enter
into
particular
on
the
subject
of
the
conspiracy
,
which
it
would
have
be
dangerous
to
confide
to
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
abstain
most
carefully
from
raise
any
false
hope
,
and
then
explain
that
the
object
of
my
visit
be
to
discover
the
person
who
be
really
responsible
for
Anne
's
disappearance
.
<EOS>
I
even
add
,
so
as
to
exonerate
myself
from
any
after
-
reproach
of
my
own
conscience
,
that
I
entertain
not
the
least
hope
of
be
able
to
trace
her
 
that
I
believe
we
should
never
see
her
alive
again
 
and
that
my
main
interest
in
the
affair
be
to
bring
to
punishment
two
man
whom
I
suspect
to
be
concern
in
lure
her
away
,
and
at
whose
hand
I
and
some
dear
friend
of
mine
have
suffer
a
grievous
wrong
.
<EOS>
with
this
explanation
I
leave
it
to
Mrs.
Clements
to
say
whether
our
interest
in
the
matter
(
whatever
difference
there
may
be
in
the
motive
which
actuate
us
)
be
not
the
same
,
and
whether
she
feel
any
reluctance
to
forward
my
object
by
give
me
such
information
on
the
subject
of
my
inquiry
as
she
happen
to
possess
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
woman
be
at
first
too
much
confused
and
agitate
to
understand
thoroughly
what
I
say
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
reply
that
I
be
welcome
to
anything
she
could
tell
me
in
return
for
the
kindness
I
have
show
to
Anne
;
but
as
she
be
not
very
quick
and
ready
,
at
the
good
of
time
,
in
talk
to
stranger
,
she
would
beg
me
to
put
her
in
the
right
way
,
and
to
say
where
I
wish
her
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
know
by
experience
that
the
plain
narrative
attainable
from
person
who
be
not
accustomed
to
arrange
their
idea
,
be
the
narrative
which
go
far
enough
back
at
the
beginning
to
avoid
all
impediment
of
retrospection
in
its
course
<EOS>
,
I
ask
Mrs.
Clements
to
tell
me
first
what
have
happen
after
she
have
leave
Limmeridge
,
and
so
,
by
watchful
questioning
,
carry
her
on
from
point
to
point
,
till
we
reach
the
period
of
Anne
's
disappearance
.
  
<EOS>
the
substance
of
the
information
which
I
thus
obtain
be
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
on
leave
the
farm
at
Todd
's
Corner
,
Mrs.
Clements
and
Anne
have
travel
that
day
as
far
as
Derby
,
and
have
remain
there
a
week
on
Anne
's
account
.
<EOS>
They
have
then
go
on
to
London
,
and
have
live
in
the
lodging
occupy
by
Mrs.
Clements
at
that
time
for
a
month
or
more
,
when
circumstance
connect
with
the
house
and
the
landlord
have
oblige
them
to
change
their
quarter
.
<EOS>
Anne
's
terror
of
be
discover
in
London
or
its
neighbourhood
,
whenever
they
venture
to
walk
out
,
have
gradually
communicate
itself
to
Mrs.
Clements
,
and
she
have
determine
on
remove
to
one
of
the
most
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
place
in
England
 
to
the
town
of
Grimsby
in
Lincolnshire
,
where
her
deceased
husband
have
pass
all
his
early
life
.
<EOS>
His
relative
be
respectable
people
settle
in
the
town
 
they
have
always
treat
Mrs.
Clements
with
great
kindness
,
and
she
think
it
impossible
to
do
better
than
go
there
and
take
the
advice
of
her
husband
's
friend
.
<EOS>
Anne
would
not
hear
of
return
to
her
mother
at
Welmingham
,
because
she
have
be
remove
to
the
Asylum
from
that
place
,
and
because
Sir
Percival
would
be
certain
to
go
back
there
and
find
her
again
.
<EOS>
there
be
serious
weight
in
this
objection
,
and
Mrs.
Clements
feel
that
it
be
not
to
be
easily
remove
.
  
<EOS>
at
Grimsby
the
first
serious
symptom
of
illness
have
show
themselves
in
Anne
.
<EOS>
They
appear
soon
after
the
news
of
Lady
Glyde
's
marriage
have
be
make
public
in
the
newspaper
,
and
have
reach
her
through
that
medium
.
  
<EOS>
the
medical
man
who
be
send
for
to
attend
the
sick
woman
discover
at
once
that
she
be
suffer
from
a
serious
affection
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
the
illness
last
long
,
leave
her
very
weak
,
and
return
at
interval
,
though
with
mitigate
severity
,
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
They
remain
at
Grimsby
,
in
consequence
,
during
the
first
half
of
the
new
year
,
and
there
they
may
probably
have
stay
much
longer
,
but
for
the
sudden
resolution
which
Anne
take
at
this
time
to
venture
back
to
Hampshire
,
for
the
purpose
of
obtain
a
private
interview
with
Lady
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
do
all
in
her
power
to
oppose
the
execution
of
this
hazardous
and
unaccountable
project
.
<EOS>
no
explanation
of
her
motive
be
offer
by
Anne
,
except
that
she
believe
the
day
of
her
death
be
not
far
off
,
and
that
she
have
something
on
her
mind
which
must
be
communicate
to
Lady
Glyde
,
at
any
risk
,
in
secret
.
<EOS>
Her
resolution
to
accomplish
this
purpose
be
so
firmly
settle
that
she
declare
her
intention
of
go
to
Hampshire
by
herself
if
Mrs.
Clements
feel
any
unwillingness
to
go
with
her
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
on
be
consult
,
be
of
opinion
that
serious
opposition
to
her
wish
would
,
in
all
probability
,
produce
another
and
perhaps
a
fatal
fit
of
illness
,
and
Mrs.
Clements
,
under
this
advice
,
yield
to
necessity
,
and
once
more
,
with
sad
foreboding
of
trouble
and
danger
to
come
,
allow
Anne
Catherick
to
have
her
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
journey
from
London
to
<EOS>
Hampshire
Mrs.
Clements
discover
that
one
of
their
fellow
-
passenger
be
well
acquaint
with
the
neighbourhood
of
Blackwater
,
and
could
give
her
all
the
information
she
need
on
the
subject
of
locality
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
she
find
out
that
the
only
place
they
could
go
to
,
which
be
not
dangerously
near
to
Sir
Percival
's
residence
,
be
a
large
village
call
Sandon
.
<EOS>
the
distance
here
from
Blackwater
Park
be
between
three
and
four
mile
 
and
that
distance
,
and
back
again
,
Anne
have
walk
on
each
occasion
when
she
have
appear
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
few
day
during
which
they
be
at
Sandon
without
be
discover
they
have
live
a
little
away
from
the
village
,
in
the
cottage
of
a
decent
widow
-
woman
who
have
a
bedroom
to
let
,
and
whose
discreet
silence
Mrs.
Clements
have
do
her
good
to
secure
,
for
the
first
week
at
least
.
<EOS>
She
have
also
try
hard
to
induce
Anne
to
be
content
with
writing
to
Lady
Glyde
,
in
the
first
instance
;
but
the
failure
of
the
warning
contain
in
the
anonymous
letter
send
to
Limmeridge
have
make
Anne
resolute
to
speak
this
time
,
and
obstinate
in
the
determination
to
go
on
her
errand
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
,
nevertheless
,
follow
her
privately
on
each
occasion
when
she
go
to
the
lake
,
without
,
however
,
venture
near
enough
to
the
boat
-
house
to
be
witness
of
what
take
place
there
.
<EOS>
when
Anne
return
for
the
last
time
from
the
dangerous
neighbourhood
,
the
fatigue
of
walking
,
day
after
day
,
distance
which
be
far
too
great
for
her
strength
,
add
to
the
exhausting
effect
of
the
agitation
from
which
she
have
suffer
,
produce
the
result
which
Mrs.
Clements
have
dread
all
along
.
<EOS>
the
old
pain
over
the
heart
and
the
other
symptom
of
the
illness
at
Grimsby
return
,
and
Anne
be
confine
to
her
bed
in
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
emergency
the
first
necessity
,
as
Mrs.
Clements
know
by
experience
,
be
to
endeavour
to
quiet
Anne
's
anxiety
of
mind
,
and
for
this
purpose
the
good
woman
go
herself
the
next
day
to
the
lake
,
to
try
if
she
could
find
Lady
Glyde
(
who
would
be
sure
,
as
Anne
say
,
to
take
her
daily
walk
to
the
boat
-
house
)
,
and
prevail
on
her
to
come

privately
to
the
cottage
near
Sandon
.
<EOS>
on
reach
the
outskirt
of
the
plantation
Mrs.
Clements

,
not
Lady
Glyde
,
but
a
tall
,
stout
,
elderly
gentleman
,
with
a
book
in
his
hand
 
in
other
word
,
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
the
Count
,
after
look
at
her
very
attentively
for
a
moment
,
ask
if
she
expect
to
see
any
one
in
that
place
,
and
add
,
before
she
could
reply
,
that
he

with
a
message
from
Lady
Glyde
,
but
that
he

not
quite
certain
whether
the
person
then
before
him

the
description
of
the
person
with
whom
he

communicate
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
Mrs.
Clements

once
confide
her
errand
to
him
,
and
entreat
that
he
would
help
to

Anne
's
anxiety
by
trust

message
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
Count
most
readily
and
kindly
comply
with
her
request
.
<EOS>
the
message
,
he
say
,
be
a
very
important
one
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
entreat
Anne
and
her
good
friend
to
return
immediately
to
London
,
as
she
feel
certain
that
Sir
Percival
would
discover
them
if
they
remain
any
longer
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Blackwater
.
<EOS>
She
be
herself
go
to
London
in
a
short
time
,
and
if
Mrs.
Clements
and
Anne
would
go
there
first
,
and
would
let
her
know
what
their
address
be
,
they
should
hear
from
her
and
see
her
in
a
fortnight
or
less
.
<EOS>
the
Count
add
that
he
have
already
attempt
to
give
a
friendly
warning
to
Anne
herself
,
but
that
she
have
be
too
much
startle
by
see
that
he
be
a
stranger
to
let
him
approach
and
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
Mrs.
Clements
reply
,
in
the
great
alarm
and
distress
,
that
she
ask
nothing
well
than
to
take
Anne
safely
to
London
,
but
that
there
be
no
present
hope
of
remove
her
from
the
dangerous
neighbourhood
,
as
she
lie
ill
in
her
bed
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
the
Count
inquire
if
Mrs.
Clements
have
send
for
medical
advice
,
and
hear
that
she
have
hitherto
hesitate
to
do
so
,
from
the
fear
of
make
their
position
publicly
know
in
the
village
,
inform
her
that
he
be
himself
a
medical
man
,
and
that
he
would
go
back
with
her
if
she
please
,
and
see
what
could
be
do
for
Anne
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
<EOS>
(
feel
a
natural
confidence
in
the
Count
,
as
a
person
trust
with
a
secret
message
from
Lady
Glyde
)
gratefully
accept
the
offer
,
and
they
go
back
together
to
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
be
asleep
when
they
get
there
.
<EOS>
the
Count
start
at
the
sight
of
her
(
evidently
from
astonishment
at
her
resemblance
to
Lady
Glyde
)
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Clements
suppose
that
he
be
only
shocked
to
see
how
ill
she
be
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
allow
her
to
be
awaken
 
<EOS>
he
be
content
with
put
question
to
Mrs.
Clements
about
her
symptom
,
with
look
at
her
,
and
with
lightly
touch
her
pulse
.
<EOS>
Sandon
be
a
large
enough
place
to
have
a
grocer
's
and
druggist
's
shop
in
it
,
and
thither
the
Count
go
to
write
his
prescription
and
to
get
the
medicine
make
up
.
<EOS>
He
bring
it
back
himself
,
and
tell
Mrs.
Clements
that
the
medicine
be
a
powerful
stimulant
,
and
that
it
would
certainly
give
Anne
strength
to
get
up
and
bear
the
fatigue
of
a
journey
to
London
of
only
a
few
hour
.
<EOS>
the
remedy
be
to
be
administer
at
stated
time
on
that
day
and
on
the
day
after
.
<EOS>
on
the
third
day
she
would
be
well
enough
to
travel
,
and
he
arrange
to
meet
Mrs.
Clements
at
the
Blackwater
station
,
and
to
see
them
off
by
the
midday
train
.
<EOS>
if
they
do
not
appear
he
would
assume
that
Anne
be
bad
,
and
would
proceed
at
once
to
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
as
event
turn
out
,
no
such
emergency
as
this
occur
.
  
<EOS>
this
medicine
have
an
extraordinary
effect
on
Anne
,
and
the
good
result
of
it
be
help
by
the
assurance
Mrs.
Clements
could
now
give
her
that
she
would
soon
see
Lady
Glyde
in
London
.
<EOS>
at
the
appoint
day
and
time
(
when
they
have
not
be
quite
so
long
as
a
week
in
Hampshire
altogether
)
,
they
arrive
at
the
station
.
<EOS>
the
Count
be
wait
there
for
them
,
and
be
talk
to
an
elderly
lady
,
who
appear
to
be
go
to
travel
by
the
train
to
London
also
.
<EOS>
He
most
kindly
assist
them
,
and
put
them
into
the
carriage
himself
,
beg
Mrs.
Clements
not
to
forget
to
send
her
address
to
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
the
elderly
lady
do
not
travel
in
the
same
compartment
,
and
they
do
not
notice
what
become
of
her
on
reach
the
London
terminus
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
secure
respectable
lodging
in
a
quiet
neighbourhood
,
and
then
write
,
as
she
have
engage
to
do
,
to
inform
Lady
Glyde
of
the
address
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
more
than
a
fortnight
pass
,
and
no
answer
come
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
that
time
a
lady
(
the
same
elderly
lady
whom
they
have
see
at
the
station
)
call
in
a
cab
,
and
say
that
she
come
from
Lady
Glyde
,
who
be
then
at
an
hotel
in
London
,
and
who
wish
to
see
Mrs.
Clements
,
for
the
purpose
of
arrange
a
future
interview
with
Anne
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
express
her
willingness
(
Anne
be
present
at
the
time
,
and
entreat
her
to
do
so
)
to
forward
the
object
in
view
,
especially
as
she
be
not
require
to
be
away
from
the
house
for
more
than
half
an
hour
at
the
most
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
elderly
lady
(
clearly
Madame
Fosco
)
then
leave
in
the
cab
.
<EOS>
the
lady
stop
the
cab
,
after
it
have
drive
some
distance
,
at
a
shop
before
they
get
to
the
hotel
,
and
beg
Mrs.
Clements
to
wait
for
her
for
a
few
minute
while
she
make
a
purchase
that
have
be
forget
.
<EOS>
She
never
appear
again
.
  
<EOS>
after
wait
some
time
Mrs.
Clements
become
alarmed
,
and
order
the
cabman
to
drive
back
to
her
lodging
.
<EOS>
when
she
get
there
,
after
an
absence
of
rather
more
than
half
an
hour
,
Anne
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
information
to
be
obtain
from
the
people
of
the
house
be
derive
from
the
servant
who
wait
on
the
lodger
.
<EOS>
She
have
open
the
door
to
a
boy
from
the
street
,
who
have
leave
a
letter
for
"
the
young
woman
who
live
on
the
second
floor
"
(
the
part
of
the
house
which
Mrs.
Clements
occupy
)
.
<EOS>
the
servant
have
deliver
the
letter
,
have
then
go
downstairs
,
and
five
minute
afterwards
have
observe
Anne
open
the
front
door
and
go
out
,
dress
in
her
bonnet
and
shawl
.
<EOS>
She
have
probably
take
the
letter
with
her
,
for
it
be
not
to
be
find
,
and
it
be
therefore
impossible
to
tell
what
inducement
have
be
offer
to
make
her
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
a
strong
one
,
for
she
would
never
stir
out
alone
in
London
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
if
Mrs.
Clements
have
not
know
this
by
experience
nothing
would
have
induce
her
to
go
away
in
the
cab
,
even
for
so
short
a
time
as
half
an
hour
only
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
could
collect
her
thought
,
the
first
idea
that
naturally
occur
to
Mrs.
Clements
be
to
go
and
make
inquiry
at
the
Asylum
,
to
which
she
dread
that
Anne
have
be
take
back
.
  
<EOS>
She
go
there
the
next
day
,
have
be
inform
of
the
locality
in
which
the
house
be
situate
by
Anne
herself
.
<EOS>
the
answer
she
receive
(
her
application
have
in
all
probability
be
make
a
day
or
two
before
the
false
Anne
Catherick
have
really
be
consign
to
safe
keeping
in
the
Asylum
)
be
,
that
no
such
person
have
be
bring
back
there
.
<EOS>
She
have
then
write
to
Mrs.
Catherick
at
Welmingham
to
know
if
she
have
see
or
hear
anything
of
her
daughter
,
and
have
receive
an
answer
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
after
that
reply
have
reach
her
,
she
be
at
the
end
of
her
resource
,
and
perfectly
ignorant
where
else
to
inquire
or
what
else
to
do
.
<EOS>
from
that
time
to
this
she
have
remain
in
total
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
Anne
's
disappearance
and
of
the
end
of
Anne
's
story
.
    
<EOS>
thus
far
the
information
which
I
have
receive
from
Mrs.
Clements
 
though
it
establish
fact
of
which
I
have
not
previously
be
aware
 
be
of
a
preliminary
character
only
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
the
series
of
deception
which
have
remove
Anne
Catherick
to
London
,
and
separate
her
from
Mrs.
Clements
,
have
be
accomplish
solely
by
Count
Fosco
and
the
Countess
,
and
the
question
whether
any
part
of
the
conduct
of
husband
or
wife
have
be
of
a
kind
to
place
either
of
them
within
reach
of
the
law
may
be
well
worthy
of
future
consideration
.
<EOS>
but
the
purpose
I
have
now
in
view
lead
me
in
another
direction
than
this
.
<EOS>
the
immediate
object
of
my
visit
to
Mrs.
Clements
be
to
make
some
approach
at
least
to
the
discovery
of
Sir
Percival
's
secret
,
and
she
have
say
nothing
as
yet
which
advance
me
on
my
way
to
that
important
end
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
necessity
of
try
to
awaken
her
recollection
of
other
time
,
person
,
and
event
than
those
on
which
her
memory
have
hitherto
be
employ
,
and
when
I
next
speak
I
speak
with
that
object
indirectly
in
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
be
of
any
help
to
you
in
this
sad
calamity
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
all
I
can
do
be
to
feel
heartily
for
your
distress
.
<EOS>
if
Anne
have
be
your
own
child
,
Mrs.
Clements
,
you
could
have
show
her
no
truer
kindness
 
<EOS>
you
could
have
make
no
ready
sacrifice
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
great
merit
in
that
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs.
Clements
simply
.
<EOS>
"
the
poor
thing
be
as
good
as
my
own
child
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
nurse
her
from
a
baby
,
sir
,
bring
her
up
by
hand
 
and
a
hard
job
it
be
to
rear
her
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
go
to
my
heart
so
to
lose
her
if
I
have
not
make
her
first
short
clothe
and
teach
her
to
walk
.
<EOS>
I
always
say
she
be
send
to
console
me
for
never
have
chick
or
child
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
and
now
she
be
lose
the
old
time
keep
come
back
to
my
mind
,
and
even
at
my
age
I
can
not
help
cry
about
her
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
indeed
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wait
a
little
to
give
Mrs.
Clements
time
to
compose
herself
.
<EOS>
be
the
light
that
I
have
be
look
for
so
long
glimmer
on
me
 
far
off
,
as
yet
 
in
the
good
woman
's
recollection
of
Anne
's
early
life
?
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
Mrs.
Catherick
before
Anne
be
bear
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
very
long
,
sir
 
not
above
four
month
.
<EOS>
We
see
a
great
deal
of
each
other
in
that
time
,
but
we
be
never
very
friendly
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
voice
be
steady
as
she
make
that
reply
.
<EOS>
painful
as
many
of
her
recollection
may
be
,
I
observe
that
it
be
unconsciously
a
relief
to
her
mind
to
revert
to
the
dimly
-
see
trouble
of
the
past
,
after
dwell
so
long
on
the
vivid
sorrow
of
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
and
Mrs.
Catherick
neighbour
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
lead
her
memory
on
as
encouragingly
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

sir
 
neighbour

have
find
it
a
hard
matter
to
get
her
to
marry
him
,
in
consequence
of
her
hold
herself
uncommonly
high
.
<EOS>
He
have
ask
and
ask
,
and
give
the
thing
up
at
last
,
see
she
be
so
contrary
about
it
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
give
it
up
<EOS>
she
turn
contrary
just
the
other
way
,
and
come
to
him
of
her
own
accord
,
without
rhyme
or
reason
seemingly
.
<EOS>
My
poor
husband
always
say
that
be
the
time
to
have
give
her
a
lesson
.
<EOS>
but
Catherick
be
too
fond
of
her
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
 
he
never
check
her
either
before
they
be
marry
or
after
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
quick
man
in
his
feeling
,
let
them
carry
him
a
deal
too
far
,
now
in
one
way
and
now
in
another
,
and
he
would
have
spoil
a
well
wife
than
Mrs.
Catherick
if
a
well
have
marry
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
speak
ill
of
any
one
,
sir
,
but
she
be
a
heartless
woman
,
with
a
terrible
will
of
her
own
 
fond
of
foolish
admiration
and
fine
clothe
,
and
not
care
to
show
so
much
as
decent
outward
respect
to
Catherick
,
kindly
as
he
always
treat
her
.
<EOS>
My
husband
say
he
think
thing
would
turn
out
badly
when
they
first
come
to
live
near
us
,
and
his
word
prove
true
.
<EOS>
before
they
have
be
quite
four
month
in
our
neighbourhood
there
be
a
dreadful
scandal
and
a
miserable
break
-
up
in
their
household
.
<EOS>
both
of
them
be
in
fault
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
both
of
them
be
equally
in
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
both
husband
and
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
Catherick
 
he
be
only
to
be
pity
.
<EOS>
I
mean
his
wife
and
the
person
 
"
  
"
and
the
person
who
cause
the
scandal
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
bear
and
bring
up
,
who
ought
to
have
set
a
well
example
.
<EOS>
You
know
him
,
sir
 
and
my
poor
dear
Anne
know
him
only
too
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Percival
Glyde
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
heart
beat
fast
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
my
hand
on
the
clue
.
<EOS>
how
little
I
know
then
of
the
winding
of
the
labyrinth
which
be
still
to
mislead
me
!
  
<EOS>
"
do
Sir
Percival
live
in
your
neighbourhood
at
that
time
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
come
among
us
as
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
die
not
long
before
in
foreign
part
.
<EOS>
I
remember
he
be
in
mourning
.
<EOS>
He
put
up
at
the
little
inn
on
the
river
<EOS>
(
they
have
pull
it
down
since
that
time
)
,
where
gentleman
use
to
go
to
fish
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
much
notice
when
he
first
come
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
common
thing
enough
for
gentleman
to
travel
from
all
part
of
England
to
fish
in
our
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
he
make
his
appearance
in
the
village
before
Anne
be
bear
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Anne
be
bear
in
the
June
month
of
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
seven
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
he
come
at
the
end
of
April
or
the
beginning
of
May
<EOS>
"
  
"
come
as
a
stranger
to
all
of
you
?
<EOS>
a
stranger
to
Mrs.
Catherick
as
well
as
to
the
rest
of
the
neighbour
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
we
think
at
first
,
sir
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
scandal
break
out
,
nobody
believe
they
be
stranger
.
<EOS>
I
remember
how
it
happen
as
well
as
if
it
be
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Catherick
come
into
our
garden
one
night
,
and
wake
us
by
throw
up
a
handful
of
gravel
from
the
walk
at
our
window
.
<EOS>
I
hear
him
beg
my
husband
,
for
the
Lord
's
sake
,
to
come
down
and
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
long
time
together
talk
in
the
porch
.
<EOS>
when
my
husband
come
back
upstairs
he
be
all
of
a
tremble
.
<EOS>
He
sit
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
he
say
to
me
,
"
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
I
always
tell
you
that
woman
be
a
bad
one
 
<EOS>
I
always
say
she
would
end
ill
,
and
I
be
afraid
in
my
own
mind
that
the
end
have
come
already
.
<EOS>
Catherick
have
find
a
lot
of
lace
handkerchief
,
and
two
fine
ring
,
and
a
new
gold
watch
and
chain
,
hide
away
in
his
wife
's
drawer
 
thing
that
nobody
but
a
bear
lady
ought
ever
to
have
 
and
his
wife
will
not
say
how
she
come
by
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
do
he
think
she
steal
them
?
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
steal
would
be
bad
enough
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
bad
than
that
,
she
be
have
no
chance
of
steal
such
thing
as
those
,
and
she
be
not
a
woman
to
take
them
if
she
have
.
<EOS>
They
be
gift
,
Lizzie
 
there
be
her
own
initial
engrave
inside
the
watch
 
and
Catherick
have
see
her
talk
privately
,
and
carry
on
as
no
married
woman
should
,
with
that
gentleman
in
mourning
,
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
say
anything
about
it
 
<EOS>
I
have
quiet
Catherick
for
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
him
to
keep
his
tongue
to
himself
,
and
his
eye
and
his
ear
open
,
and
to
wait
a
day
or
two
,
till
he
can
be
quite
certain
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
be
both
of
you
wrong
,
"
say
i.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
in
nature
,
comfortable
and
respectable
as
she
be
here
,
that
Mrs.
Catherick
should
take
up
with
a
chance
stranger
like
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
"
<EOS>
'
ay
,
but
be
he
a
stranger
to
her
?
"
say
my
husband
.
<EOS>
"
You
forget
how
Catherick
's
wife
come
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
She
go
to
him
of
her
own
accord
,
after
say
no
over
and
over
again
when
he
ask
her
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
wicked
woman
before
her
time
,
Lizzie
,
who
have
use
honest
man
who
love
them
as
a
means
of
save
their
character
,
and
I
be
sorely
afraid
this
Mrs.
Catherick
be
as
wicked
as
the
bad
of
them
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
,
"
say
my
husband
,
"
we
shall
soon
see
.
"
<EOS>
and
only
two
day
afterwards
we
do
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
wait
for
a
moment
before
she
go
on
.
<EOS>
even
in
that
moment
,
I
begin
to
doubt
whether
the
clue
that
I
think
I
have
find
be
really
lead
me
to
the
central
mystery
of
the
labyrinth
after
all
.
<EOS>
be
this
common
,
too
common
,
story
of
a
man
's
treachery
and
a
woman
's
frailty
the
key
to
a
secret
which
have
be
the
lifelong
terror
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
?
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
Catherick
take
my
husband
's
advice
and
wait
,
"
Mrs.
Clements
continue
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
as
I
tell
you
,
he
have
not
long
to
wait
.
<EOS>
on
the
second
day
he
find
his
wife
and
Sir
Percival
whisper
together
quite
familiar
,
close
under
the
vestry
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
think
the
neighbourhood
of
the
vestry
be
the
last
place
in
the
world
where
anybody
would
think
of
look
after
them
,
but
,
however
that
may
be
,
there
they
be
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
,
be
seemingly
surprised
and
confound
,
defend
himself
in
such
a
guilty
way
that
poor
Catherick
(
whose
quick
temper
I
have
tell
you
of
already
)
fall
into
a
kind
of
frenzy
at
his
own
disgrace
,
and
strike
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
match
(
and
I
be
sorry
to
say
it
)
for
the
man
who
have
wrong
him
,
and
he
be
beat
in
the
cruel
manner
,
before
the
neighbour
,
who
have
come
to
the
place
on
hear
the
disturbance
,
could
run
in
to
part
them
.
<EOS>
all
this
happen
towards
evening
,
and
before
nightfall
,
when
my
husband
go
to
Catherick
's
house
,
he
be
go
,
nobody
know
where
.
<EOS>
no
live
soul
in
the
village
ever
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
He
know
too
well
,
by
that
time
,
what
his
wife
's
vile
reason
have
be
for
marry
him
,
and
he
feel
his
misery
and
disgrace
,
especially
after
what
have
happen
to
him
with
Sir
Percival
,
too
keenly
.
<EOS>
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
put
an
advertisement
in
the
paper
beg
him
to
come
back
,
and
say
that
he
should
not
lose
his
situation
or
his
friend
.
<EOS>
but
Catherick
have
too
much
pride
and
spirit
,
as
some
people
say
 
too
much
feeling
,
as
I
think
,
sir
 
to
face
his
neighbour
again
,
and
try
to
live
down
the
memory
of
his
disgrace
.
<EOS>
My
husband
hear
from
him
when
he
have
leave
England
,
and
hear
a
second
time
,
when
he
be
settle
and
do
well
in
America
.
<EOS>
He
be
alive
there
now
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
but
none
of
us
in
the
old
country
 
his
wicked
wife
least
of
all
 
be
ever
likely
to
set
eye
on
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
become
of
Sir
Percival
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
he
stay
in
the
neighbourhood
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
he
,
sir
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
too
hot
to
hold
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
hear
at
high
word
with
Mrs.
Catherick
the
same
night
when
the
scandal
break
out
,
and
the
next
morning
he
take
himself
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Catherick
?
<EOS>
surely
she
never
remain
in
the
village
among
the
people
who
know
of
her
disgrace
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
do
,
sir
.
<EOS>
She
be
hard
enough
and
heartless
enough
to
set
the
opinion
of
all
her
neighbour
at
flat
defiance
.
<EOS>
She
declare
to
everybody
,
from
the
clergyman
downwards
,
that
she
be
the
victim
of
a
dreadful
mistake
,
and
that
all
the
scandal
-
monger
in
the
place
should
not
drive
her
out
of
it
,
as
if
she
be
a
guilty
woman
.
<EOS>
all
through
my
time
she
live
at
Old
Welmingham
,
and
after
my
time
,
when
the
new
town
be
build
,
and
the
respectable
neighbour
begin
move
to
it
,
she
move
too
,
as
if
she
be
determine
to
live
among
them
and
scandalise
them
to
the
very
last
.
<EOS>
there
she
be
now
,
and
there
she
will
stop
,
in
defiance
of
the
good
of
them
,
to
her
die
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
how
have
she
live
through
all
these
year
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
be
her
husband
able
and
willing
to
help
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
both
able
and
willing
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
"
in
the
second
letter
he
write
to
my
good
man
,
he
say
she
have
bear
his
name
,
and
live
in
his
home
,
and
,
wicked
as
she
be
,
she
must
not
starve
like
a
beggar
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
He
could
afford
to
make
her
some
small
allowance
,
and
she
may
draw
for
it
quarterly
at
a
place
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
accept
the
allowance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
a
farthing
of
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
She
say
she
would
never
be
behold
to
Catherick
for
bit
or
drop
,
if
she
live
to
be
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
keep
her
word
ever
since
.
<EOS>
when
my
poor
dear
husband
die
,
and
leave
all
to
me
,
Catherick
's
letter
be
put
in
my
possession
with
the
other
thing
,
and
I
tell
her
to
let
me
know
if
she
be
ever
in
want
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
let
all
England
know
I
be
in
want
,
"
she
say
,
"
before
I
tell
Catherick
,
or
any
friend
of
Catherick
's
.
<EOS>
take
that
for
your
answer
,
and
give
it
to
him
for
an
answer
,
if
he
ever
write
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
suppose
that
she
have
money
of
her
own
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
little
,
if
any
,
sir
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
,
and
say
truly
,
I
be
afraid
,
that
her
mean
of
living
come
privately
from
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
last
reply
I
wait
a
little
,
to
reconsider
what
I
have
hear
.
<EOS>
if
I
unreservedly
accept
the
story
so
far
,
it
be
now
plain
that
no
approach
,
direct
or
indirect
,
to
the
Secret
have
yet
be
reveal
to
me
,
and
that
the
pursuit
of
my
object
have
end
again
in
leave
me
face
to
face
with
the
most
palpable
and
the
most
disheartening
failure
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
point
in
the
narrative
which
make
me
doubt
the
propriety
of
accept
it
unreservedly
,
and
which
suggest
the
idea
of
something
hide
below
the
surface
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
account
to
myself
for
the
circumstance
of
the
clerk
's
guilty
wife
voluntarily
live
out
all
her
after
-
existence
on
the
scene
of
her
disgrace
.
<EOS>
the
woman
's
own
report
statement
that
she
have
take
this
strange
course
as
a
practical
assertion
of
her
innocence
do
not
satisfy
me
.
<EOS>
It
seem
,
to
my
mind
,
more
natural
and
more
probable
to
assume
that
she
be
not
so
completely
a
free
agent
in
this
matter
as
she
have
herself
assert
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
who
be
the
likeliest
person
to
possess
the
power
of
compel
her
to
remain
at
Welmingham
?
<EOS>
the
person
unquestionably
from
whom
she
derive
the
mean
of
living
.
<EOS>
She
have
refuse
assistance
from
her
husband
,
she
have
no
adequate
resource
of
her
own
<EOS>
,
she
be
a
friendless
,
degraded
woman
 
<EOS>
from
what
source
should
she
derive
help
but
from
the
source
at
which
report
point
 
Sir
Percival
Glyde
?
  
<EOS>
reason
on
these
assumption
,
and
always
bear
in
mind
the
one
certain
fact
to
guide
me
,
that
Mrs.
Catherick
be
in
possession
of
the
Secret
,
I
easily
understand
that
it
be
Sir
Percival
's
interest
to
keep
her
at
Welmingham
,
because
her
character
in
that
place
be
certain
to
isolate
her
from
all
communication
with
female
neighbour
,
and
to
allow
her
no
opportunity
of
talk
incautiously
in
moment
of
free
intercourse
with
inquisitive
bosom
friend
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
mystery
to
be
conceal
?
<EOS>
not
Sir
Percival
's
infamous
connection
with
Mrs.
Catherick
's
disgrace
,
for
the
neighbour
be
the
very
people
who
know
of
it
 
not
<EOS>
the
suspicion
that
he
be
Anne
's
father
,
for
Welmingham
be
the
place
in
which
that
suspicion
must
inevitably
exist
.
<EOS>
if
I
accept
the
guilty
appearance
describe
to
me
as
unreservedly
as
other
have
accept
them
,
if
I
draw
from
them
the
same
superficial
conclusion
which
Mr.
Catherick
and
all
his
neighbour
have
draw
,
where
be
the
suggestion
,
in
all
that
I
have
hear
,
of
a
dangerous
secret
between
Sir
Percival
and
Mrs.
Catherick
,
which
have
be
keep
hide
from
that
time
to
this
?
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
in
those
steal
meeting
,
in
those
familiar
whispering
between
the
clerk
's
wife
and
"
the
gentleman
in
mourning
,
"
the
clue
to
discovery
exist
beyond
a
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
possible
that
appearance
in
this
case
have
point
one
way
while
the
truth
lie
all
the
while
unsuspected
in
another
direction
?
<EOS>
Could
Mrs.
Catherick
's
assertion
,
that
she
be
the
victim
of
a
dreadful
mistake
,
by
any
possibility
be
true
?
<EOS>
or
,
assume
it
to
be
false
,
could
the
conclusion
which
associate
Sir
Percival
with
her
guilt
have
be
found
in
some
inconceivable
error
?
<EOS>
have
Sir
Percival
,
by
any
chance
,
court
the
suspicion
that
be
wrong
for
the
sake
of
divert
from
himself
some
other
suspicion
that
be
right
?
<EOS>
here
 
if
I
could
find
it
 
here
be
the
approach
to
the
Secret
,
hide
deep
under
the
surface
of
the
apparently
unpromising
story
which
I
have
just
hear
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
question
be
now
direct
to
the
one
object
of
ascertain
whether
Mr.
Catherick
have
or
have
not
arrive
truly
at
the
conviction
of
his
wife
's
misconduct
.
<EOS>
the
answer
I
receive
from
Mrs.
Clements
leave
me
in
no
doubt
whatever
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
have
,
on
the
clear
evidence
,
compromise
her
reputation
,
while
a
single
woman
,
with
some
person
unknown
,
and
have
marry
to
save
her
character
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
positively
ascertain
,
by
calculation
of
time
and
place
into
which
I
need
not
enter
particularly
,
that
the
daughter
who
bear
her
husband
's
name
be
not
her
husband
's
child
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
object
of
inquiry
,
whether
it
be
equally
certain
that
Sir
Percival
must
have
be
the
father
of
Anne
,
be
beset
by
far
great
difficulty
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
no
position
to
try
the
probability
on
one
side
or
on
the
other
in
this
instance
by
any
well
test
than
the
test
of
personal
resemblance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
often
see
Sir
Percival
when
he
be
in
your
village
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
very
often
,
"
reply
Mrs.
Clements
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
observe
that
Anne
be
like
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
at
all
like
him
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
she
like
her
mother
,
then
?
"
  
"
not
like
her
mother
either
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
be
dark
,
and
full
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
not
like
her
mother
and
not
like
her
(
suppose
)
father
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
test
by
personal
resemblance
be
not
to
be
implicitly
trust
,
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
be
not
to
be
altogether
reject
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
be
it
possible
to
strengthen
the
evidence
by
discover
any
conclusive
fact
in
relation
to
the
life
of
Mrs.
Catherick
and
Sir
Percival
before
they
either
of
them
appear
at
Old
Welmingham
?
<EOS>
when
I
ask
my
next
question
I
put
them
with
this
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
Sir
Percival
first
arrive
in
your
neighbourhood
,
"
I
say
,
"
do
you
hear
where
he
have
come
from
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
<EOS>
some
say
from
Blackwater
Park
,
and
some
say
from
Scotland
 
<EOS>
but
nobody
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
Mrs.
Catherick
live
in
service
at
Varneck
Hall
immediately
before
her
marriage
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
have
she
be
long
in
her
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
three
or
four
year
,
sir
;
I
be
not
quite
certain
which
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
hear
the
name
of
the
gentleman
to
whom
Varneck
Hall
belong
at
that
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
His
name
be
Major
Donthorne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Mr.
Catherick
,
or
do
any
one
else
you
know
,
ever
hear
that
Sir
Percival
be
a
friend
of
Major
Donthorne
's
,
or
ever
see
Sir
Percival
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Varneck
Hall
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherick
never
do
,
sir
,
that
I
can
remember
 
nor
any
one
else
either
,
that
I
know
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
note
down
Major
Donthorne
's
name
and
address
,
on
the
chance
that
he
may
still
be
alive
,
and
that
it
may
be
useful
at
some
future
time
to
apply
to
him
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
impression
on
my
mind
be
now
decidedly
adverse
to
the
opinion
that
Sir
Percival
be
Anne
's
father
,
and
decidedly
favourable
to
the
conclusion
that
the
secret
of
his
steal
interview
with
Mrs.
Catherick
be
entirely
unconnected
with
the
disgrace
which
the
woman
have
inflict
on
her
husband
's
good
name
.
<EOS>
I
could
think
of
no
further
inquiry
which
I
may
make
to
strengthen
this
impression
 
I
could
only
encourage
Mrs.
Clements
to
speak
next
of
Anne
's
early
day
,
and
watch
for
any
chance
-
suggestion
which
may
in
this
way
offer
itself
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
hear
yet
,
"
I
say
,
"
how
the
poor
child
,
bear
in
all
this
sin
and
misery
,
come
to
be

,
Mrs.
Clements
,
to
your
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nobody
else
,
sir
,
to
take
the
little
helpless
creature
in
hand

"
reply
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
"
the
wicked
mother
seem
to
hate
it
 
as
if
the
poor
baby
be
in
fault
!
 
<EOS>
from
the
day
it
be
bear
.
<EOS>
My
heart
be
heavy
for
the
child
,
and
I
make
the
offer
to
bring
it
up
as
tenderly
as
if
it
be
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Anne
remain
entirely
under
your
care
from
that
time
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
quite
entirely
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
have
her
whim
and
fancy
about
it
at
time
,
and
use
now
and
then
to
lay
claim
to
the
child
,
as
if
she
want
to
spite
me
for
bring
it
up
.
<EOS>
but
these
fit
of
her
never
last
for
long
.
<EOS>
poor
little
Anne
be
always
return
to
me
,
and
be
always
glad
to
get
back
 
though
she
lead
but
a
gloomy
life
in
my
house
,
have
no
playmate
,
like
other
child
,
to
brighten
her
up
.
<EOS>
Our
long
separation
be
when
her
mother
take
her
to
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
just
at
that
time
I
lose
my
husband
,
and
I
feel
it
be
as
well
,
in
that
miserable
affliction
,
that
Anne
should
not
be
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
be
between
ten
and
eleven
year
old
then
,
slow
at
her
lesson
,
poor
soul
,
and
not
so
cheerful
as
other
child
 
<EOS>
but
as
pretty
a
little
girl
to
look
at
as
you
would
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
I
wait
at
home
till
her
mother
bring
her
back
,
and
then
I
make
the
offer
to
take
her
with
me
to
London
 
<EOS>
the
truth
being
,
sir
,
that
I
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
stop
at
Old
Welmingham
after
my
husband
's
death
,
the
place
be
so
change
and
so
dismal
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
Mrs.
Catherick
consent
to
your
proposal
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
<EOS>
She
come
back
from
the
north
harder
and
bitterer
than
ever
.
<EOS>
folk
do
say
that
she
have
be
oblige
to
ask
Sir
Percival
's
leave
to
go
,
to
begin
with
;
and
that
she
only
go
to
nurse
her
die
sister
at
Limmeridge
because
the
poor
woman
be
report
to
have
save
money
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
that
she
hardly
leave
enough
to
bury
her
.
<EOS>
these
thing
may
have
sour
Mrs.
Catherick
likely
enough
,
but
however
that
may
be
,
she
would
not
hear
of
my
take
the
child
away
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
like
distress
us
both
by
part
us
.
<EOS>
all
I
could
do
be
to
give
Anne
my
direction
,
and
to
tell
her
privately
,
if
she
be
ever
in
trouble
,
to
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
year
pass
before
she
be
free
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
her
again
,
poor
soul
,
till
the
night
she
escape
from
the
mad
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Mrs.
Clements
,
why
Sir
Percival
Glyde
shut
her
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
what
Anne
herself
tell
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
the
poor
thing
use
to
ramble
and
wander
about
it
sadly
.
<EOS>
She
say
her
mother
have
get
some
secret
of
Sir
Percival
's
to
keep
,
and
have
let
it
out
to
her
long
after
I
leave
Hampshire
 
<EOS>
and
when
Sir
Percival
find
she
know
it
,
he
shut
her
up
.
<EOS>
but
she
never
could
say
what
it
be
when
I
ask
her
.
<EOS>
all
she
could
tell
me
be
,
that
her
mother
may
be
the
ruin
and
destruction
of
Sir
Percival
if
she
choose
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
may
have
let
out
just
as
much
as
that
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
be
next
to
certain
<EOS>
I
should
have
hear
the
whole
truth
from
Anne
,
if
she
have
really
know
it
as
she
pretend
to
do
,
and
as
she
very
likely
fancy
she
do
,
poor
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
idea
have
more
than
once
occur
to
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
tell
Marian
that
I
doubt
whether
Laura
be
really
on
the
point
of
make
any
important
discovery
when
she
and
Anne
Catherick
be
disturb
by
Count
Fosco
at
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
in
character
with
Anne
's
mental
affliction
that
she
should
assume
an
absolute
knowledge
of
the
secret
on
no
well
ground
than
vague
suspicion
,
derive
from
hint
which
her
mother
have
incautiously
let
drop
in
her
presence
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
guilty
distrust
would
,
in
that
case
,
infallibly
inspire
him
with
the
false
idea
that
Anne
know
all
from
her
mother
,
just
as
it
have
afterwards
fix
in
his
mind
the
equally
false
suspicion
that
his
wife
know
all
from
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
the
time
be
pass
,
the
morning
be
wear
away
.
<EOS>
It
be
doubtful
,
if
I
stay
longer
,
whether
I
should
hear
anything
more
from
Mrs.
Clements
that
would
be
at
all
useful
to
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
discover
those
local
and
family
particular
,
in
relation
to
Mrs.
Catherick
,
of
which
I
have
be
in
search
,
and
I
have
arrive
at
certain
conclusion
,
entirely
new
to
me
,
which
may
immensely
assist
in
direct
the
course
of
my
future
proceeding
.
<EOS>
I
rise
to
take
my
leave
,
and
to
thank
Mrs.
Clements
for
the
friendly
readiness
she
have
show
in
afford
me
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
you
must
have
think
me
very
inquisitive
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
trouble
you
with
more
question
than
many
people
would
have
care
to
answer

<EOS>
"
You
be
heartily
welcome
,
sir
,
to
anything
I
can
tell
you

answer
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
She
stop
and
look
at
me
wistfully
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
wish
,
"
say
the
poor
woman
,
"
you
could
have
tell
me
a
little
more
about
Anne
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
see
something
in
your
face
when
you
come
in
which
look
as
if
you
could
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
how
hard
it
be
not
even
to
know
whether
she
be
live
or
dead
.
<EOS>
I
could
bear
it
better
if
I
be
only
certain
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
never
expect
we
should
see
her
alive
again
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
sir
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
for
truth
 
that
it
have
please
God
to
take
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
proof
against
this
appeal
,
it
would
have
be
unspeakably
mean
and
cruel
of
me
if
I
have
resist
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
there
be
no
doubt
of
the
truth
,
"
I
answer
gently
;
"
I
have
the
certainty
in
my
own
mind
that
her
trouble
in
this
world
be
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
poor
woman
drop
into
her
chair
and
hide
her
face
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
sir
,
"
she
say
,
"
how
do
you
know
it
?
<EOS>
who
can
have
tell
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
one
have
tell
me
,
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
reason
for
feel
sure
of
it
 
reason
which
I
promise
you
shall
know
as
soon
as
I
can
safely
explain
them

I
be
certain
she

not

her
last

I
be
certain
the
heart
complaint
from
which
she
suffer
so
sadly

the
true
cause

her
death

You
shall
feel
as
sure
of
this

I
do

soon
 
you
shall
know

before
long

that
she
be
bury
in
a
quiet
country
churchyard
 
in
a
pretty
,
peaceful
place

you
may
have
choose
for
her
yourself

Mrs.
Clements

young

and
Anne

!
<EOS>
do
you
say
,
sir

"
say
the
poor
woman
,
remove
the
handkerchief
from
her
face
,
and
look
up
at
me
for
the
first
time
,
"
do
you
say
that
she
have
be
nicely
bury
?
<EOS>
be
it
the
sort
of
funeral
she
may
have
have
if
she
have
really
be
my
own
child
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
assure
her
that
it
be
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
take
an
inexplicable
pride
in
my
answer
 
to
find
a
comfort
in
it
which
no
other
and
high
consideration
could
afford
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
break
my
heart
,
"
she
say
simply
,
"
if
Anne
have
not
be
nicely
bury
 
but
<EOS>
how
do
you
know
it
,
sir
?
<EOS>
who
tell
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
once
more
entreat
her
to
wait
until
I
could
speak
to
her
unreservedly
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
sure
to
see
me
again
,
"
I
say
,
"
for
I
have
a
favour
to
ask
when
you
be
a
little
more
composed
 
perhaps
in
a
day
or
two

<EOS>

"
do
not

on
my

Mrs.
Clements

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
wish
to
ask
you
one
last
question
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
want
to
know
Mrs.
Catherick
's
address
at
Welmingham

"
  
<EOS>
My
request
so
startled
Mrs.
Clements
,
that
,
for
the
moment
,
even
the
tiding
of
Anne
's
death
seem
to
be
drive
from
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Her
tear
suddenly
cease
to
flow
,
and
she
sit
look
at
me
in
blank
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
the
Lord
's

<EOS>
she

,
"

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
this

Mrs.
Clements

I
reply
,
"
I
want
to
know
the
secret
of
those
private
meeting

something
more

of
that
woman

past
conduct

and
of
that
man

past
relation

<EOS>

Mrs.

rise
in

earnestness

lay
her

on
my
arm

<EOS>
"
She
be
an
awful
woman

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
your
warning
be
kindly
mean

Mrs.

I
be
determined

whatever
come

<EOS>
Mrs.

look

anxiously
in
the
face

<EOS>
"
I
see
your

be
make
up

she

.
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
the
address

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
write
it
down
in
my
pocket

book
and
then
take
her
hand
to
say
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
from

I

<EOS>
Mrs.

sigh
and
shake
her
head
doubtfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
an
old
woman
's
advice
be
sometimes
worth
take

"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
think
twice
before
you
go
to
Welmingham

"
    
<EOS>
when
I
reach
home
again
after
my
interview
with
Mrs.
Clements
,
I
be
strike
by
the
appearance
of
a
change
in
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
the
unvarying
gentleness
and
patience
which
long
misfortune
have
try
so
cruelly
and
have
never
conquer
yet
,
seem
now
to
have
suddenly
fail
her
.
<EOS>
insensible
to
all
Marian
's
attempt
to
soothe
and
amuse
her
,
she
sit
,
with
her
neglect
drawing
push
away
on
the
table
,
her
eye
resolutely
cast
down
,
her
finger
twine
and
untwine
themselves
restlessly
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
Marian
rise
when
I
come
in
,
with
a
silent
distress
in
her
face
,
wait
for
a
moment
to
see
if
Laura
would
look
up
at
my
approach
,
whisper
to
me
,
"
try
if
you
can
rouse
her
,
"
and
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
sit
down
in
the
vacant
chair
 
gently
unclasp
the
poor
,
worn
,
restless
finger
,
and
take
both
her
hand
in
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
think
of
,
Laura
?
<EOS>
tell
me
,
my
darling

tell
me
what
it
be

<EOS>
She
struggle
with
herself
,
and
raise
her
eye
to
mine
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
feel
happy
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
can
not
help
think
 
"
She
stop
,
bend
forward
a
little
,
and
lay
her
head
on
my
shoulder
,
with
a
terrible
mute
helplessness
that
strike
me
to
the
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
try

I
repeat
gently
;

try

tell
me
why
you
be
not
happy

<EOS>
"
I
be
so
useless
 
<EOS>
I
be
such
a
burden
on
both
of
you

she
answer
,
with
a
weary
,
hopeless
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
You
work
and
get
money
,
Walter
,

Marian
help
you

<EOS>
why
be
there
nothing
I
can
do
?
<EOS>
You
will
end
in
like
marian
better
than
you
like
me
 
<EOS>
you
will
,
because
I
be
so
helpless

<EOS>
oh
,
do
not
,
do
not
,
do
not
treat
me
like
a
child
!

"
  
<EOS>
I
raise
her
head
,
and
smooth
away
the
tangle
hair
that
fall
over
her
face
,
and
kiss
her
 
my
poor
,
fade
flower
!
<EOS>
my
lost
,
afflict
sister
!
<EOS>
"
You
shall
help
us
,
Laura
,
"
I
say
,
"
you
shall
begin
,
my
darling
,
to
-
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
at
me
with
a
feverish
eagerness
,
with
a
breathless
interest
,
that
make
me
tremble
for
the
new
life
of
hope
which
I
have
call
into
being
by
those
few
word
.
  
<EOS>
I
rise
,
and
set
her
drawing
material
in
order
,
and
place
them
near
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
I
work
and
get
money
by
draw
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
now
you
have
take
such
pain
,
now
you
be
so
much
improved
,
you
shall
begin
to
work
and
get
money
too
.
<EOS>
try
to
finish
this
little
sketch
as
nicely
and
prettily
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
do
I
will
take
it
away
with
me
,
and
the
same
person
will
buy
it
who
buy
all
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
You
shall
keep
your
own
earning
in
your
own
purse
,
and
Marian
shall
come
to
you
to
help
us
,
as
often
as
she
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
think
how
useful
you
be
go
to
make
yourself
to
both
of
us
,
and
you
will
soon
be
as
happy
,
Laura
,
as
the
day
be
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
face
grow
eager
,
and
brighten
into
a
smile
.
<EOS>
in
the
moment
while
it
last
,
in
the
moment
when
she
again
take
up
the
pencil
that
have
be
lay
aside
,
she
almost
look
like
the
Laura
of
past
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
rightly
interpret
the
first
sign
of
a
new
growth
and
strength
in
her
mind
,
unconsciously
express
themselves
in
the
notice
she
have
take
of
the
occupation
which
fill
her
sister
's
life
and
mine
.
<EOS>
Marian
<EOS>
(
when
I
tell
her
what
have
pass
)
see
,
as
I
see
,
that
she
be
long
to
assume
her
own
little
position
of
importance
,
to
raise
herself
in
her
own
estimation
and
in
ours
 
and
,
from
that
day
,
we
tenderly
help
the
new
ambition
which
give
promise
of
the
hopeful
,
happy
future
,
that
may
now
not
be
far
off
.
<EOS>
Her
drawing
,
as
she
finish
them
,
or
try
to
finish
them
,
be
place
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
Marian
take
them
from
me
and
hide
them
carefully
,
and
I
set
aside
a
little
weekly
tribute
from
my
earning
,
to
be
offer
to
her
as
the
price
pay
by
stranger
for
the
poor
,
faint
,
valueless
sketch
,
of
which
I
be
the
only
purchaser
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
sometimes
to
maintain
our
innocent
deception
,
when
she
proudly
bring
out
her
purse
to
contribute
her
share
towards
the
expense
,
and
wonder
with
serious
interest
,
whether
I
or
she
have
earn
the
most
that
week
.
<EOS>
I
have
all
those
hide
drawing
in
my
possession
<EOS>
still
 
they
be
my
treasure
beyond
price
 
<EOS>
the
dear
remembrance
that
I
love
to
keep
alive
 
the
friend
in
past
adversity
that
my
heart
will
never
part
from
,
my
tenderness
never
forget
.
  
<EOS>
be
<EOS>
I
trifle
,
here
,
with
the
necessity
of
my
task
?
<EOS>
be
I
look
forward
to
the
happy
time
which
my
narrative
have
not
yet
reach
?
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
back
again
 
back
to
the
day
of
doubt
and
dread
,
when
the
spirit
within
me
struggle
hard
for
its
life
,
in
the
icy
stillness
of
perpetual
suspense
.
<EOS>
I
have
pause
and
rest
for
a
while
on
my
forward
course
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
perhaps
,
time
waste
,
if
the
friend
who
read
these
page
have
pause
and
rest
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
the
first
opportunity
I
could
find
of
speak
to
Marian
in
private
,
and
of
communicate
to
her
the
result
of
the
inquiry
which
I
have
make
that
morning
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
share
the
opinion
on
the
subject
of
my
propose
journey
to
Welmingham
,
which
Mrs.
Clements
have
already
express
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
surely
,
Walter
,
"
she
say
,
"
you
hardly
know
enough
yet
to
give
you
any
hope
of
claim
Mrs.
Catherick
's
confidence
?
<EOS>
be
it
wise
to
proceed
to
these
extremity
,
before
you
have
really
exhaust
all
safe
and
simple
mean
of
attain
your
object
?
<EOS>
when
you
tell
me
that
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
be
the
only
two
people
in
existence
who
know
the
exact
date
of
Laura
's
journey
,
you
forgot
,
and
I
forgot
,
that
there
be
a
third
person
who
must
surely
know
it
 
<EOS>
I
mean
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
far
easy
,
and
far
less
dangerous
,
to
insist
on
a
confession
from
her
,
than
to
force
it
from
Sir
Percival
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
easy
,
"
I
reply
,
"
but
we
be
not
aware
of
the
full
extent
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
's
connivance
and
interest
in
the
conspiracy
,
and
we
be
therefore
not
certain
that
the
date
have
be
impress
on
her
mind
,
as
it
have
be
assuredly
impressed
on
the
mind
of
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
,
now
,
to
waste
the
time
on
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
which
may
be
all
-
important
to
the
discovery
of
the
one
assailable
point
in
Sir
Percival
's
life
.
<EOS>
be
you
think
a
little
too
seriously
,
Marian
,
of
the
risk
I
may
run
in
return
to
Hampshire
?
<EOS>
be
you
begin
to
doubt
whether
Sir
Percival
Glyde
may
not
in
the
end
be
more
than
a
match
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
be
more
than
your
match
,
"
she
reply
decidedly
,
"
because
he
will
not
be
help
in
resist
you
by
the
impenetrable
wickedness
of
the
Count
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
lead
you
to
that
conclusion
?
<EOS>
"
I
reply
,
in
some
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
knowledge
of
Sir
Percival
's
obstinacy
and
impatience
of
the
Count
's
control
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
will
insist
on
meet
you
single
-
handed
 
just
as
he
insist
at
first
on
act
for
himself
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
the
time
for
suspect
the
Count
's
interference
will
be
the
time
when
you
have
Sir
Percival
at
your
mercy
.
<EOS>
His
own
interest
will
then
be
directly
threaten
,
and
he
will
act
,
Walter
,
to
terrible
purpose
in
his
own
defence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
may
deprive
him
of
his
weapon
beforehand
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
some
of
the
particular
I
have
hear
from
Mrs.
Clements
may
yet
be
turn
to
account
against
him
,
and
other
mean
of
strengthen
the
case
may
be
at
our
disposal
.
<EOS>
there
be
passage
in
Mrs.
Michelson
's
narrative
which
show
that
the
Count
find
it
necessary
to
place
himself
in
communication
with
Mr.
Fairlie
,
and
there
may
be
circumstance
which
compromise
him
in
that
proceeding
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
away
,
Marian
,
write
to
Mr.
Fairlie
and
say
that
you
want
an
answer
describe
exactly
what
pass
between
the
Count
and
himself
,
and
inform
you
also
of
any
particular
that
may
have
come
to
his
knowledge
at
the
same
time
in
connection
with
his
niece

<EOS>
tell
him
that
the
statement
you
request
will
,
sooner

later
,
be
insist
on
,
if
he
show
any
reluctance

furnish
you
with
it

the
letter
shall
be

Walter
.
<EOS>
but
be
you
really
determined
to
go
to
Welmingham
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
absolutely
determined
.
<EOS>
I
will
devote
the
next
two
day
to
earn
what
we
want
for
the
week
to
come
,
and
on
the
third
day
I
go
to
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
the
third
day
come
I
be
ready
for
my
journey
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
be
possible
that
I
may
be
absent
for
some
little
time
,
I
arrange
with
Marian
that
we
be
to
correspond
every
day
 
of
course
address
each
other
by
assume
name
,
for
caution
's
sake
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
I
hear
from
her
regularly
,
I
should
assume
that
nothing
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
but
if
the
morning
come
and
bring
me
no
letter
,
my
return
to
London
would
take
place
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
by
the
first
train
.
<EOS>
I
contrive
to
reconcile
Laura
to
my
departure
by
tell
her
that
I
be
go
to
the
country
to
find
new
purchaser
for

<EOS>
Marian
follow
me
downstairs
to
the
street
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
remember
what
anxious
heart

here

"
she
whisper
,
as
we
stand
together
in
the
passage
.
"
<EOS>
remember
all
the
hope
that
hang
on
your
safe
return
.
<EOS>
if
strange
thing
happen
to
you
on
this
journey
 
if
you
and
Sir
Percival
meet
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
make
you
think
we
shall
meet
?
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
I
have
fear
and
fancy
that
I
can
not
account
for
.
<EOS>
laugh
at
them
,
Walter
,
if
you
like
 
<EOS>
but
,
for
God
's
sake
,
keep
your
temper
if
you
come
in
contact
with
that
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
never
fear
,
Marian
!
<EOS>
I
answer
for
my
self
-
control
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
those
word
we
part
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
briskly
to
the
station
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
glow
of
hope
in
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
grow
conviction
in
my
mind
that
my
journey
this
time
would
not
be
take
in
vain
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
,
clear
,
cold
morning
.
<EOS>
My
nerve
be
firmly
string
,
and
I
feel
all
the
strength
of
my
resolution
stir
in
me
vigorously
from
head
to
foot
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
cross
the
railway
platform
,
and
look
right
and
leave
among
the
people
congregate
on
it
,
to
search
for
any
face
among
them
that
I
know
,
the
doubt
occur
to
me
whether
it
may
not
have
be
to
my
advantage
if
I
have
adopt
a
disguise
before
set
out
for
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
something
so
repellent
to
me
in
the
idea
 
something
so
meanly
like
the
common
herd
of
spy
and
informer
in
the
mere
act
of
adopt
a
disguise
 
that
I
dismiss
the
question
from
consideration
almost
as
soon
as
it
have
rise
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
even
as
a
mere
matter
of
expediency
<EOS>
the
proceeding
be
doubtful
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
if
I
try
the
experiment
at
home
the
landlord
of
the
house
would
sooner
or
later
discover
me
,
and
would
have
his
suspicion
arouse
immediately
.
<EOS>
if
I
try
it
away
from
home
the
same
person
may
see
me
,
by
the
commonest
accident
,
with
the
disguise
and
without
it
,
and
I
should
in
that
way
be
invite
the
notice
and
distrust
<EOS>
which
it
be
my
most
pressing
interest
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
in
my
own
character
I
have
act
thus
far
 
and
in
my
own
character
I
be
resolve
to
continue
to
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
the
train
leave
me
at
Welmingham
early
in
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
be
there
any
wilderness
of
sand
in
the
desert
of
Arabia
,
be
there
any
prospect
of
desolation
among
the
ruin
of
Palestine
,
which
can
rival
the
repel
effect
on
the
eye
,
and
the
depressing
influence
on
the
mind
,
of
an
english
country
town
in
the
first
stage
of
its
existence
,
and
in
the
transition
state
of
its
prosperity
?
<EOS>
I
ask
myself
that
question
as
I
pass
through
the
clean
desolation
,
the
neat
ugliness
,
the
prim
torpor
of
the
street
of
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
and
the
tradesman
who
stare
after
me
from
their
lonely
shop
 
the
tree
that
droop
helpless
in
their
arid
exile
of
unfinished
crescent
and
square
 
the
dead
house
-
carcass
that
wait
in
vain
for
the
vivify
human
element
to
animate
them
with
the
breath
of
life
 
<EOS>
every
creature
that
I
see
,
every
object
that
I
pass
,
seem
to
answer
with
one
accord
:
the
desert
of
Arabia
be
innocent
of
our
civilised
desolation
 
the
ruin
of
Palestine
be
incapable
of
our
modern
gloom
!
  
<EOS>
I
inquire
my
way
to
the
quarter
of
the
town
in
which
Mrs.
Catherick
live
,
and
on
reach
it
find
myself
in
a
square
of
small
house
,
one
story
high
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
bare
little
plot
of
grass
in
the
middle
,
protect
by
a
cheap
wire
fence
.
<EOS>
an
elderly
nursemaid
and
two
child
be
stand
in
a
corner
of
the
enclosure
,
look
at
a
lean
goat
tether
to
the
grass
.
<EOS>
two
foot
-
passenger
be
talk
together
on
one
side
of
the
pavement
before
the
house
,
and
an
idle
little
boy
be
lead
an
idle
little
dog
along
by
a
string
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
dull
tinkling
of
a
piano
at
a
distance
,
accompany
by
the
intermittent
knock
of
a
hammer
nearer
at
hand
.
<EOS>
these
be
all
the
sight
and
sound
of
life
that
encounter
me
when
I
enter
the
square
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
at
once
to
the
door
of
Number
Thirteen
 
<EOS>
the
number
of
Mrs.
Catherick
's
house
 
and
knock
,
without
wait
to
consider
beforehand
how
I
may
best
present
myself
when
I
get
in
.
<EOS>
the
first
necessity
be
to
see
Mrs.
Catherick
.
<EOS>
I
could
then
judge
,
from
my
own
observation
,
of
the
safe
and
easy
manner
of
approach
the
object
of
my
visit
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
be
open
by
a
melancholy
middle
-
aged
woman
servant
.
<EOS>
I
give
her
my
card
,
and
ask
if
I
could
see
Mrs.
Catherick
.
<EOS>
the
card
be
take
into
the
front
parlour
,
and
the
servant
return
with
a
message
request
me
to
mention
what
my
business
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
say
,
if
you
please
,
that
my
business
relate
to
Mrs.
Catherick
's
daughter
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
good
pretext
I
could
think
of
,
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
to
account
for
my
visit
.
  
<EOS>
the
servant
again
retire
to
the
parlour
,
again
return
,
and
this
time
beg
me
,
with
a
look
of
gloomy
amazement
,
to
walk
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
enter
a

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
the
tone

<EOS>
She

and
look
me
all
over
attentively
,
from
head
to
foot
,
as
I
sit
down
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
my
only
chance
with
this
woman
be
to
speak
to
her
in
her
own
tone
,
and
to
meet
her
,
at
the
outset
of

<EOS>
She
put
that
extraordinary

without

slight
change
in
her
voice

her

<EOS>
She

plain
possible
form

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
however

I

<EOS>
there
be
not

mockery

smile
just
hover

furtive
light
of
hatred
lurk
deep
in

drive

from

silence

farewell

I
open

outer
door

clergyman
who
have
already
pass
the
house
once

about
to
pass
it
again
,
on
his
way
back
through

square

door

step
to
let
him
go
by

look
round

so
,
at

parlour
window

hear
his
footstep
approach

lonely
place

on

foot
at
the
window
again

wait
for
him

<EOS>
not
all
the
strength

all
the
terrible
passion
I
have
rouse
in
that
woman

heart

could
loosen
her
desperate
hold
on
the
one
fragment
of
social
consideration

year
of
resolute
effort
have
just
drag
within
her
grasp

<EOS>
there
she
be
again
,
not
a
minute
after
I
have
leave
her

place
purposely
in
a
position
which
make
it
a
matter
of
common
courtesy
on
the
part
of
the
clergyman
to
bow
to
her
for
a
second
time

He
raise
his
hat
once
more

see
the
hard
ghastly
face
behind
the
window
soften

light
up

gratified
pride

grim
black
cap

twice

I
leave
the
house
,
feel
that
Mrs.
Catherick
have
help
me
a
step
forward
,
in
spite

herself

before
I
have
reach
the
turning

my
attention
be
suddenly
arouse
by
the
sound
of
a
closing
door
behind
me

I
look
round
,
and
see
an
undersized
man
in
black
on
the
door

step
of
a
house

,
as
well
as

of
abode
 
next
to
it
,
on
the
side
near
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
man
do
not
hesitate
a
moment
about
the
direction
he
should
take
.
<EOS>
He
advance
rapidly
towards
the
turning
at
which
I
have
stop
.
<EOS>
I
recognise
him
as
the
lawyer
's
clerk
,
who
have
precede
me
in
my
visit
to
Blackwater
Park
,
and
who
have
try
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
,
when
I
ask
him
if
I
could
see
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
wait
where
I
be
,
to
ascertain
whether
his
object
be
to
come
to
close
quarter
and
speak
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
to
my
surprise
he
pass
on
rapidly
,
without
say
a
word
,
without
even
look
up
in
my
face
as
he
go
by
.
<EOS>
this
be
such
a
complete
inversion
of
the
course
of
proceeding
which
I
have
every
reason
to
expect
on
his
part
,
that
my
curiosity
,
or
rather
my
suspicion
,
be
arouse
,
and
I
determine
on
my
side
to
keep
him
cautiously
in
view
,
and
to
discover
what
the
business
may
be
in
which
he
be
now
employ
.
<EOS>
without
care
whether
he
see
me
or
not
,
I
walk
after
him
.
<EOS>
He
never
look
back
,
and
he
lead
me
straight
through
the
street
to
the
railway
station
.
  
<EOS>
the
train
be
on
the
point
of
start
,
and
two
or
three
passenger
who
be
late
be
cluster
round
the
small
opening
through
which
the
ticket
be
issue
.
<EOS>
I
join
them
,
and
distinctly
hear
the
lawyer
's
clerk
demand
a
ticket
for
the
Blackwater
station
.
<EOS>
I
satisfy
myself
that
he
have
actually
leave
by
the
train
before
I
come
away
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
interpretation
that
I
could
place
on
what
I
have
just
see
and
hear
.
<EOS>
I
have
unquestionably
observe
the
man
leave
a
house
which
closely
adjoin
Mrs.
Catherick
's
residence
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
probably
place
there
,
by
Sir
Percival
's
direction
,
as
a
lodger
,
in
anticipation
of
my
inquiry
lead
me
,
sooner
or
later
,
to
communicate
with
Mrs.
Catherick
.
<EOS>
He
have
doubtless
see
me
go
in
and
come
out
,
and
he
have
hurry
away
by
the
first
train
to
make
his
report
at
Blackwater
Park
,
to
which
place
Sir
Percival
would
naturally
betake
himself
(
know
what
he
evidently
know
of
my
movement
)
,
in
order
to
be
ready
on
the
spot
,
if
I
return
to
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
before
many
day
be
over
,
there
seem
every
likelihood
now
that
he
and
I
may
meet
.
  
<EOS>
whatever
result
event
may
be
destine
to
produce
,
I
resolve
to
pursue
my
own
course
,
straight
to
the
end
in
view
,
without
stop
or
turn
aside
for
Sir
Percival
or
for
any
one
.
<EOS>
the
great
responsibility
which
weigh
on
me
heavily
in
London
 
<EOS>
the
responsibility
of
so
guide
my
slight
action
as
to
prevent
them
from
lead
accidentally
to
the
discovery
of
Laura
's
place
of
refuge
 
be
remove
,
now
that
I
be
in
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
I
could
go
and
come
as
I
please
at
Welmingham
,
and
if
I
chance
to
fail
in
observe
any
necessary
precaution
,
the
immediate
result
,
at
least
,
would
affect
no
one
but
myself
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
leave
the
station
the
winter
evening
be
begin
to
close
in
.
<EOS>
there
be
little
hope
of
continue
my
inquiry
after
dark
to
any
useful
purpose
in
a
neighbourhood
that
be
strange
to
me
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
make
my
way
to
the
near
hotel
,
and
order
my
dinner
and
my
bed
.
<EOS>
this
do
,
I
write
to
Marian
,
to
tell
her
that
I
be
safe
and
well
,
and
that
I
have
fair
prospect
of
success
.
<EOS>
I
have
direct
her
,
on
leave
home
,
to
address
the
first
letter
she
write
to
me
(
the
letter
I
expect
to
receive
the
next
morning
)
to
"
the
Post
-
Office
,
Welmingham
,
"
and
I
now
beg
her
to
send
her
second
day
's
letter
to
the
same
address
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
easily
receive
it
by
write
to
the
postmaster
if
I
happen
to
be
away
from
the
town
when
it
arrive
.
  
<EOS>
the
coffee
-
room
of
the
hotel
,
as
it
grow
late
in
the
evening
,
become
a
perfect
solitude
.
<EOS>
I
be
leave
to
reflect
on
what
I
have
accomplish
that
afternoon
as
uninterruptedly
as
if
the
house
have
be
my
own
.
<EOS>
before
I
retire
to
rest
<EOS>
I
have
attentively
think
over
my
extraordinary
interview
with
Mrs.
Catherick
from
begin
to
end
,
and
have
verify
at
my
leisure
the
conclusion
which
I
have
hastily
draw
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
vestry
of
Old
Welmingham
church
be
the
starting
-
point
from
which
my
mind
slowly
work
its
way
back
through
all
that
I
have
hear
Mrs.
Catherick
say
,
and
through
all
I
have
see
Mrs.
Catherick
do
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
time
when
the
neighbourhood
of
the
vestry
be
first
refer
to
in
my
presence
by
Mrs.
Clements
,
I
have
think
it
the
strange
and
most
unaccountable
of
all
place
for
Sir
Percival
to
select
for
a
clandestine
meeting
with
the
clerk
's
wife
.
<EOS>
influence
by
this
impression
,
and
by
no
other
,
I
have
mention
"
the
vestry
of
the
church
"
before
Mrs.
Catherick
on
pure
speculation
 
<EOS>
it
represent
one
of
the
minor
peculiarity
of
the
story
which
occur
to
me
while
I
be
speak
.
<EOS>
I
be
prepared
for
her
answer
me
confusedly
or
angrily
,
but
the
blank
terror
that
seize
her
when
I
say
the
word
take
me
completely
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
before
associate
Sir
Percival
's
Secret
with
the
concealment
of
a
serious
crime
which
Mrs.
Catherick
know
of
,
<EOS>
but
I
have
go
no
further
than
this
.
<EOS>
now
the
woman
's
paroxysm
of
terror
associate
the
crime
,
either
directly
or
indirectly
,
with
the
vestry
,
and
convince
me
that
she
have
be
more
than
the
mere
witness
of
it
 
<EOS>
she
be
also
the
accomplice
,
beyond
a
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
what
have
be
the
nature
of
the
crime
?
<EOS>
surely
there
be
a
contemptible
side
to
it
,
as
well
as
a
dangerous
side
,
or
Mrs.
Catherick
would
not
have
repeat
my
own
word
,
refer
to
Sir
Percival
's
rank
and
power
,
with
such
marked
disdain
as
she
have
certainly
display
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
contemptible
crime
then
and
a
dangerous
crime
,
and
she
have
share
in
it
,
and
it
be
associate
with
the
vestry
of
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
consideration
to
be
dispose
of
lead
me
a
step
farther
from
this
point
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
's
undisguised
contempt
for
Sir
Percival
plainly
extend
to
his
mother
as
well
.
<EOS>
She
have
refer
with
the
bitter
sarcasm
to
the
great
family
he
have
descend
from
 
"
especially
by
the
mother
's
side
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
this
mean
?
  
<EOS>
there
appear
to
be
only
two
explanation
of
it
.
<EOS>
either
his
mother
's
birth
have
be
low
,
or
his
mother
's
reputation
be
damage
by
some
hide
flaw
with
which
Mrs.
Catherick
and
Sir
Percival
be
both
privately
acquaint
?
<EOS>
I
could
only
put
the
first
explanation
to
the
test
by
look
at
the
register
of
her
marriage
,
and
so
ascertain
her
maiden
name
and
her
parentage
as
a
preliminary
to
further
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
if
the
second
case
suppose
be
the
true
one
,
what
have
be
the
flaw
in
her
reputation
?
<EOS>
remember
the
account
which
Marian
have
give
me
of
Sir
Percival
's
father
and
mother
,
and
of
the
suspiciously
unsocial
secluded
life
they
have
both
lead
,
I
now
ask
myself
whether
it
may
not
be
possible
that
his
mother
have
never
be
marry
at
all
.
<EOS>
here
again
the
register
might
,
by
offer
write
evidence
of
the
marriage
,
prove
to
me
,
at
any
rate
,
that
this
doubt
have
no
foundation
in
truth
.
<EOS>
but
where
be
the
register
to
be
find
?
<EOS>
at
this
point
I
take
up
the
conclusion
which
I
have
previously
form
,
and
the
same
mental
process
which
have
discover
the
locality
of
the
conceal
crime
,
now
lodge
the
register
also
in
the
vestry
of
Old
Welmingham
church
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
result
of
my
interview
with
Mrs.
Catherick
 
these
<EOS>
be
the
various
consideration
,
all
steadily
converge
to
one
point
,
which
decide
the
course
of
my
proceeding
on
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
morning
be
cloudy
and
lowering
,
but
no
rain
fall
.
<EOS>
I
leave
my
bag
at
the
hotel
to
wait
there
till
I
call
for
it
,
and
,
after
inquire
the
way
,
set
forth
on
foot
for
Old
Welmingham
church
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
walk
of
rather
more
than
two
mile
,
the
ground
rise
slowly
all
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
high
point
stand
the
church
 
an
ancient
,
weather
-
beat
building
,
with
heavy
buttress
at
its
side
,
and
a
clumsy
square
tower
in
front
.
<EOS>
the
vestry
at
the
back
be
build
out
from
the
church
,
and
seem
to
be
of
the
same
age
.
<EOS>
round
the
building
at
interval
appear
the
remain
of
the
village
which
Mrs.
Clements
have
describe
to
me
as
her
husband
's
place
of
abode
in
former
year
,
and
which
the
principal
inhabitant
have
long
since
desert
for
the
new
town
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
empty
house
have
be
dismantle
to
their
outer
wall
,
some
have
be
leave
to
decay
with
time
,
and
some
be
still
inhabit
by
person
evidently
of
the
poor
class
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dreary
scene
,
and
yet
,
in
the
bad
aspect
of
its
ruin
,
not
so
dreary
as
the
modern
town
that
I
have
just
leave
.
<EOS>
here
there
be
the
brown
,
breezy
sweep
of
surround
field
for
the
eye
to
repose
on
 
here
the
tree
,
leafless
as
they
be
,
still
vary
the
monotony
of
the
prospect
,
and
help
the
mind
to
look
forward
to
summer
-
time
and
shade
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
move
away
from
the
back
of
the
church
,
and
pass
some
of
the
dismantle
cottage
in
search
of
a
person
who
may
direct
me
to
the
clerk
,
I
see
two
man
saunter
out
after
me
from
behind
a
wall
.
<EOS>
the
tall
of
the
two
 
a
stout
muscular
man
in
the
dress
of
a
gamekeeper
 
be
a
stranger
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
other
be
one
of
the
man
who
have
follow
me
in
London
on
the
day
when
I
leave
Mr.
Kyrle
's
office
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
particular
notice
of
him
at
the
time
;
and
I
feel
sure
that
I
be
not
mistake
in
identify
the
fellow
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
neither
he
nor
his
companion
attempt
to
speak
to
me
,
and
both
keep
themselves
at
a
respectful
distance
,
but
the
motive
of
their
presence
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
church
be
plainly
apparent
.
<EOS>
It
be
exactly
as
I
have
suppose
 
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
be
already
prepared
for
me
.
<EOS>
My
visit
to
Mrs.
Catherick
have
be
report
to
him
the
evening
before
,
and
those
two
man
have
be
place
on
the
look
-
out
near
the
church
in
anticipation
of
my
appearance
at
Old
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
want
any
further
proof
that
my
investigation
have
take
the
right
direction
at
last
,
the
plan
now
adopt
for
watch
me
would
have
supply
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
on
away
from
the
church
till
I
reach
one
of
the
inhabited
house
,
with
a
patch
of
kitchen
garden
attach
to
it
on
which
a
labourer
be
at
work
.
<EOS>
He
direct
me
to
the
clerk
's
abode
,
a
cottage
at
some
little
distance
off
,
stand
by
itself
on
the
outskirt
of
the
forsaken
village
.
<EOS>
the
clerk
be
indoor
,
and
be
just
put
on
his
greatcoat
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
cheerful
,
familiar
,
loudly
-
talkative
old
man
,
with
a
very
poor
opinion
(
as
I
soon
discover
)
of
the
place
in
which
he
live
,
and
a
happy
sense
of
superiority
to
his
neighbour
in
virtue
of
the
great
personal
distinction
of
have
once
be
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
<EOS>
you
come
so
early
,
sir
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
when
I
have
mention
the
object
of
my
visit
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
be
away
in
ten
minute
more
.
<EOS>
parish
business
,
sir
,
and
a
goodish
long
trot
<EOS>
before
it
be
all
do
for
a
man
at
my
age
.
<EOS>
but
,
bless
you
,
I
be
strong
on
my
leg
still
!
<EOS>
as
long
as
a
man
do
not
give
at
his
leg
,
there
be
a
deal
of
work
leave
in
him
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
so
yourself
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
his
key
down
while
he
be
talk
from
a
hook
behind
the
fireplace
,
and
lock
his
cottage
door
behind
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
at
home
to
keep
house
for
me
,
"
say
the
clerk
,
with
a
cheerful
sense
of
perfect
freedom
from
all
family
encumbrance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
wife
be
in
the
churchyard
there
,
and
my
child
be
all
married
.
<EOS>
a
wretched
place
this
,
be
not
it
,
sir
?
<EOS>
but
the
parish
be
a
large
one
 
<EOS>
every
man
could
not
get
through
the
business
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
learn
do
it
,
and
I
have
have
my
share
,
and
a
little
more
.
<EOS>
I
can
talk
the
Queen
's
English
(
God
bless
the
Queen
!
)
,
and
that
be
more
than
most
of
the
people
about
here
can
do
.
<EOS>
You
be
from
London
,
I
suppose
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
London
a
matter
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
ago
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
news
there
now
,
if
you
please
?
"
  
<EOS>
chatter
on
in
this
way
,
he
lead
me
back
to
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
I
look
about
to
see
if
the
two
spy
be
still
in
sight
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
visible
anywhere
.
<EOS>
after
have
discover
my
application
to
the
clerk
,
they
have
probably
conceal
themselves
where
they
could
watch
my
next
proceeding
in
perfect
freedom
.
  
<EOS>
the
vestry
door
be
of
stout
old
oak
,
stud
with
strong
nail
,
and
the
clerk
put
his
large
heavy
key
into
the
lock
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
know
that
he
have
a
difficulty
to
encounter
,
and
who
be
not
quite
certain
of
creditably
conquer

the

,
bless
you

the

fall
short

there
they
be

wait

It

all

six

<EOS>
beautiful

all
flourish

say
it
be
a
disgrace
not

restore
the

repair
the
famous
carving

so
on
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
prospectus
that

the
architect

the
whole

what

there

My
anxiety
to
examine
the
register
do
not
dispose
me
to
offer
much
encouragement
to
the
old
man
's
talkativeness
.
<EOS>
I
agree
with
him
that
nobody
could
help
the
untidiness
of
the
vestry

then
suggest
that
we

proceed
to
our

in
eighteen
hundred

that
I

safely
start

be

I
inquire

surely
a

separate

travel
back
through
December
eighteen

no

<EOS>
not

<EOS>
under
the
heading

that
month
in

I
look
carefully
at
the
entry

It
be
at
the
bottom
of
a

be
for
want
of
room
compress
into
a

that
occupy

the
entry

follow
it
(
on

be
noticeable
in
another
way

the
large
space
it
occupy
,
the
record
in
this
case
register
the
marriage

two
brother

<EOS>
the
register
of
the
marriage
of
Sir
Felix
Glyde
be
in
no
respect
remarkable
except
for
the
narrowness
of
the
space
into
which
it
be
compress
at
the
bottom
of
the
page

<EOS>
the
information
about
his

note
down

particular
in

feel
as
I
do
so
both
doubtful

dishearten
about
my

the
Secret
which
I

any
mystery
unexplained
have
arise
out
of
my
visit
to
the
vestry

I

no

what
progress
have
I
make
towards
discover
the
suspect
stain

what

to
do
next

<EOS>
the
one
immediate
resource
leave
to
me
appear
to
be
this

<EOS>
I
may
institute
inquiry
about
"
Miss
Elster
of
Knowlesbury

"
on
the
chance
of
advance
towards
the
main
object
of
my
investigation

by
first
discover
the
secret
of
Mrs.

book

<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
reply
,
"
but
I
have
some
inquiry
still
to
make
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
clergyman
who
officiate
here
in
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
three
be
no
longer
alive

<EOS>

dead
three

four
year
before
I
come
here

and
that
be
as
long
ago
as
the
year
twenty
-
seven

<EOS>
I
get
this
place
,
sir

"
persist
my
talkative
old
friend

"
through
the
clerk
before
me
leave
it

<EOS>
They

home
by
his

she
be
live

I

all
I

"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
not
tell
me
your
former
master
live
at
Knowlesbury
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
call
to
mind
the
long
story
about
the
precise
gentleman
of
the
old
school
with
which
my
talkative
friend
have
weary
me
before
he
open
the
register
-
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

to
be
sure
,
sir
,
"
reply
the
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Wansborough

at
Knowlesbury

and
young
Mr.
Wansborough

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
just
now
he
be
vestry
-
clerk
,
like
his
father
before
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
quite
sure
that
I
know
what
a
vestry
-
clerk
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
you
indeed
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
and
you
come
from
London
too
!
<EOS>
every
parish
church
,
you
know
,
have
a
vestry

clerk
and
a
parish

clerk

<EOS>
the
parish

clerk

a
man
like
me
(
except
that
I
have
get
a
deal
more
learning

most

I
do
not
boast
of
it

<EOS>
the
vestry

clerk
be
a
sort
of
an
appointment
that
the
lawyer
get
,
and
if
there
be
any
business
to
be
do
for
the
vestry
,
why
there
they
be
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
the
same
in
London

<EOS>
every
parish
church

have
get
its
vestry

clerk

you
may
take
my
word
for
it

he
be
sure
to
be
a
lawyer

<EOS>

I
suppose

Knowlesbury

place

<EOS>
"
  
"
a
long
stretch
,
sir

the
clerk
,
with
that
exaggerated
idea
of
distance
,
and
that
vivid
perception
of
difficulty
in
get
from
place
to
place

which
be
peculiar

people

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nigh
on
five
mile

I
can
tell
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
still
early
in
the
forenoon
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
time
for
a
walk
to
Knowlesbury
and
back
again
to
Welmingham
;
and
there
be
no
person
probably
in
the
town
who
be
fitter
to
assist
my
inquiry
about
the
character
and
position
of
Sir
Percival
's
mother
before
her
marriage
than
the
local
solicitor
.
<EOS>
resolve
to
go
at
once
to
Knowlesbury
on
foot
,
I
lead
the
way
out
of
the
vestry
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
kindly
,
sir
,
"
say
the
clerk
,
as
I
slip
my
little
present
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
really
go
to
walk
all
the
way
to
Knowlesbury
and
back
?
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
you
be
strong
on
your
leg
,
too
 
and
what
a
blessing
that
be
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
there
be
the
road
,
you
can
not
miss
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
be
go
your
way
 
<EOS>
it
be
pleasant
to
meet
with
gentleman
from
London
in
a
lost
corner
like
this
.
<EOS>
one
hear
the
news
.
<EOS>
wish
you
good
-
morning
,
sir
,
and
thank
you
kindly
once
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
part
.
<EOS>
as
I
leave
the
church
behind
me
I
look
back
,
and
there
be
the
two
man
again
on
the
road
below
,
with
a
third
in
their
company
,
that
third
person
be
the
short
man
in
black
whom
I
have
trace
to
the
railway
the
evening
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
three
stand
talk
together
for
a
little
while
,
then
separate
.
<EOS>
the
man
in
black
go
away
by
himself
towards
Welmingham
 
<EOS>
the
other
two
remain
together
,
evidently
wait
to
follow
me
as
soon
as
I
walk
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
proceed
on
my
way
without
let
the
fellow
see
that
I
take
any
special
notice
of
them
.
<EOS>
They
cause
me
no
conscious
irritation
of
feeling
at
that
moment
 
on
the
contrary
,
they
rather
revive
my
sinking
hope
.
<EOS>
in
the
surprise
of
discover
the
evidence
of
the
marriage
,
I
have
forget
the
inference
I
have
draw
on
first
perceive
the
man
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
Their
reappearance
remind
me
that
Sir
Percival
have
anticipate
my
visit
to
Old
Welmingham
church
as
the
next
result
of
my
interview
with
Mrs.
Catherick
 
otherwise
he
would
never
have
place
his
spy
there
to
wait
for
me
.
<EOS>
smoothly
and
fairly
as
appearance
look
in
the
vestry
,
there
be
something
wrong
beneath
them
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
register
-
book
,
for
aught
I
know
,
that
I
have
not
discover
yet
.
    
<EOS>
once
out
of
sight
of
the
church
,
I
press
forward
briskly
on
my
way
to
Knowlesbury
.
  
<EOS>
the
road
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
straight
and
level
.
<EOS>
whenever
I
look
back
over
it
I
see
the
two
spy
steadily
follow
me
.
<EOS>
for
the
great
part
of
the
way
they
keep
at
a
safe
distance
behind
.
<EOS>
but
once
or
twice
they
quicken
their
pace
,
as
if
with
the
purpose
of
overtake
me
,
then
stop
,
consult
together
,
and
fall
back
again
to
their
former
position
.
<EOS>
They
have
some
special
object
evidently
in
view
,
and
they
seem
to
be
hesitate
or
differ
about
the
good
mean
of
accomplish
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
guess
exactly
what
their
design
may
be
,
but
I
feel
serious
doubt
of
reach
Knowlesbury
without
some
mischance
happen
to
me
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
these
doubt
be
realise
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
enter
on
a
lonely
part
of
the
road
,
with
a
sharp
turn
at
some
distance
ahead
,
and
have
just
conclude
(
calculate
by
time
)
that
I
must
be
get
near
to
the
town
,
when
I
suddenly
hear
the
step
of
the
man
close
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
could
look
round
,
one
of
them
(
the
man
by
whom
I
have
be
follow
in
London
)
pass
rapidly
on
my
left
side
and
hustle
me
with
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
more
irritated
by
the
manner
in
which
he
and
his
companion
have
dog
my
step
all
the
way
from
Old
Welmingham
than
I
be
myself
aware
of
,
and
I
unfortunately
push
the
fellow
away
smartly
with
my
open
hand
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
shout
for
help
.
<EOS>
His
companion
,
the
tall
man
in
the
gamekeeper
's
clothe
,
spring
to
my
right
side
,
and
the
next
moment
the
two
scoundrel
hold
me
pinion
between
them
in
the
middle
of
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
the
conviction
that
a
trap
have
be
lay
for
me
,
and
the
vexation
of
know
that
I
have
fall
into
it
,
fortunately
restrain
me
from
make
my
position
still
bad
by
an
unavaile
struggle
with
two
man
,
one
of
whom
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
be
more
than
a
match
for
me
single
-
handed
.
<EOS>
I
repress
the
first
natural
movement
by
which
I
have
attempt
to
shake
them
off
,
and
look
about
to
see
if
there
be
any
person
near
to
whom
I
could
appeal
.
  
<EOS>
a
labourer
be
at
work
in
an
adjoining
field
who
must
have
witness
all
that
have
pass
.
<EOS>
I
call
to
him
to
follow
us
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
with
stolid
obstinacy
,
and
walk
away
in
the
direction
of
a
cottage
which
stand
back
from
the
high
-
road
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
the
man
who
hold
me
between
them
declare
their
intention
of
charge
me
with
an
assault
.
<EOS>
I
be
cool
enough
and
wise
enough
now
to
make
no
opposition
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
drop
your
hold
of
my
arm
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
I
will
go
with
you
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
the
man
in
the
gamekeeper
's
dress
roughly
refuse
.
<EOS>
but
the
short
man
be
sharp
enough
to
look
to
consequence
,
and
not
to
let
his
companion
commit
himself
by
unnecessary
violence
.
<EOS>
He
make
a
sign
to
the
other
,
and
I
walk
on
between
them
with
my
arm
free
.
  
<EOS>
We
reach
the
turning
in
the
road
,
and
there
,
close
before
us
,
be
the
suburb
of
Knowlesbury
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
local
policeman
be
walk
along
the
path
by
the
roadside
.
<EOS>
the
man
at
once
appeal
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
reply
that
the
magistrate
be
then
sit
at
the
town
-
hall
,
and
recommend
that
we
should
appear
before
him
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
on
to
the
town
-
hall
.
<EOS>
the
clerk
make
out
a
formal
summon
,
and
the
charge
be
prefer
against
me
,
with
the
customary
exaggeration
and
the
customary
perversion
of
the
truth
on
such
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
(
an
ill
-
tempered
man
,
with
a
sour
enjoyment
in
the
exercise
of
his
own
power
)
inquire
if
any
one
on
or
near
the
road
have
witness
the
assault
,
and
,
greatly
to
my
surprise
,
the
complainant
admit
the
presence
of
the
labourer
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
I
be
enlighten
,
however
,
as
to
the
object
of
the
admission
by
the
magistrate
's
next
word
.
<EOS>
He
remand
me
at
once
for
the
production
of
the
witness
,
express
,
at
the
same
time
,
his
willingness
to
take
bail
for
my
reappearance
if
I
could
produce
one
responsible
surety
to
offer
it
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
know
in
the
town
he
would
have
liberate
me
on
my
own
recognisance
,
but
as
I
be
a
total
stranger
<EOS>
it
be
necessary
that
I
should
find
responsible
bail
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
object
of
the
stratagem
be
now
disclose
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
so
manage
as
to
make
a
remand
necessary
in
a
town
where
I
be
a
perfect
stranger
,
and
where
I
could
not
hope
to
get
my
liberty
on
bail
.
<EOS>
the
remand
merely
extend
over
three
day
,
until
the
next
sitting
of
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
but
in
that
time
,
while
I
be
in
confinement
,
Sir
Percival
may
use
any
mean
he
please
to
embarrass
my
future
proceeding
 
perhaps
to
screen
himself
from
detection
altogether
 
without
the
slight
fear
of
any
hindrance
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
three
day
the
charge
would
,
no
doubt
,
be
withdraw
,
and
the
attendance
of
the
witness
would
be
perfectly
useless
.
  
<EOS>
My
indignation
,
I
may
almost
say
,
my
despair
,
at
this
mischievous
check
to
all
further
progress
 
so
base
and
trifling
in
itself
,
and
yet
so
dishearten
and
so
serious
in
its
probable
result
 
<EOS>
quite
unfitted
me
at
first
to
reflect
on
the
good
mean
of
extricate
myself
from
the
dilemma
in
which
I
now
stand
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
folly
to
call
for
writing
material
,
and
to
think
of
privately
communicate
my
real
position
to
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
the
hopelessness
and
the
imprudence
of
this
proceeding
fail
to
strike
me
before
I
have
actually
write
the
opening
line
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
I
have
push
the
paper
away
 
not
till
,
I
be
ashamed
to
say
,
I
have
almost
allow
the
vexation
of
my
helpless
position
to
conquer
me
 
that
a
course
of
action
suddenly
occur
to
my
mind
,
which
Sir
Percival
have
probably
not
anticipate
,
and
which
may
set
me
free
again
in
a
few
hour
.
<EOS>
I
determine
to
communicate
the
situation
in
which
I
be
place
to
Mr.
Dawson
,
of
Oak
Lodge
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
visit
this
gentleman
's
house
,
it
may
be
remember
,
at
the
time
of
my
first
inquiry
in
the
Blackwater
Park
neighbourhood
,
and
I
have
present
to
him
a
letter
of
introduction
from
Miss
Halcombe
,
in
which
she
recommend
me
to
his
friendly
attention
in
the
strong
term
.
<EOS>
I
now
write
,
refer
to
this
letter
,
and
to
what
I
have
previously
tell
Mr.
Dawson
of
the
delicate
and
dangerous
nature
of
my
inquiry
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
reveal
to
him
the
truth
about
Laura
,
have
merely
describe
my
errand
as
be
of
the
utmost
importance
to
private
family
interest
with
which
Miss
Halcombe
be
concerned
.
<EOS>
use
the
same
caution
still
,
I
now
account
for
my
presence
at
Knowlesbury
in
the
same
manner
,
and
I
put
it
to
the
doctor
to
say
whether
the
trust
repose
in
me
by
a
lady
whom
he
well
know
,
and
the
hospitality
I
have
myself
receive
in
his
house
,
justify
me
or
not
in
ask
him
to
come
to
my
assistance
in
a
place
where
I
be
quite
friendless
.
  
<EOS>
I
obtain
permission
to
hire
a
messenger
to
drive
away
at
once
with
my
letter
in
a
conveyance
which
may
be
use
to
bring
the
doctor
back
immediately
.
<EOS>
Oak
Lodge
be
on
the
Knowlesbury
side
of
Blackwater
.
<EOS>
the
man
declare
he
could
drive
there
in
forty
minute
,
and
could
bring
Mr.
Dawson
back
in
forty
more
.
<EOS>
I
direct
him
to
follow
the
doctor
wherever
he
may
happen
to
be
,
if
he
be
not
at
home
,
and
then
sit
down
to
wait
for
the
result
with
all
the
patience
and
all
the
hope
that
I
could
summon
to
help
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
quite
half
-
past
one
when
the
messenger
depart
.
<EOS>
before
half
-
past
three
he
return
,
and
bring
the
doctor
with
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
's
kindness
,
and
the
delicacy
with
which
he
treat
his
prompt
assistance
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
,
almost
overpower
me
.
<EOS>
the
bail
require
be
offer
,
and
accept
immediately
.
<EOS>
before
four
o'clock
,
on
that
afternoon
,
I
be
shake
hand
warmly
with
the
good
old
doctor
 
a
free
man
again
 
in
the
street
of
Knowlesbury
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
hospitably
invite
me
to
go
back
with
him
to
Oak
Lodge
,
and
take
up
my
quarter
there
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
reply
that
my
time
be
not
my
own
,
and
I
could
only
ask
him
to
let
me
pay
my
visit
in
a
few
day
,
when
I
may
repeat
my
thank
,
and
offer
to
him
all
the
explanation
which
I
feel
to
be
only
his
due
,
but
which
I
be
not
then
in
a
position
to
make
.
<EOS>
We
part
with
friendly
assurance
on
both
side
,
and
I
turn
my
step
at
once
to
Mr.
Wansborough
's
office
in
the
High
Street
.
  
<EOS>
time
be
now
of
the
last
importance
.
  
<EOS>
the
news
of
my
be
free
on
bail
would
reach
Sir
Percival
,
to
an
absolute
certainty
,
before
night
.
<EOS>
if
the
next
few
hour
do
not
put
me
in
a
position
to
justify
his
bad
fear
,
and
to
hold
him
helpless
at
my
mercy
,
I
may
lose
every
inch
of
the
ground
I
have
gain
,
never
to
recover
it
again
.
<EOS>
the
unscrupulous
nature
of
the
man
,
the
local
influence
he
possess
,
the
desperate
peril
of
exposure
with
which
my
blindfold
inquiry
threaten
him
 
all
warn
me
to
press
on
to
positive
discovery
,
without
the
useless
waste
of
a
single
minute
.
<EOS>
I
have
find
time
to
think
while
I
be
wait
for
Mr.
Dawson
's
arrival
,
and
I
have
well
employ
it
.
<EOS>
certain
portion
of
the
conversation
of
the
talkative
old
clerk
,
which
have
weary
me
at
the
time
,
now
recur
to
my
memory
with
a
new
significance
,
and
a
suspicion
cross
my
mind
darkly
which
have
not
occur
to
me
while
I
be
in
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
on
my
way
to
Knowlesbury
,
I
have
only
propose
to
apply
to
Mr.
Wansborough
for
information
on
the
subject
of
Sir
Percival
's
mother
.
<EOS>
My
object
now
be
to
examine
the
duplicate
register
of
Old
Welmingham
Church
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wansborough
be
in
his
office
when
I
inquire
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
jovial
,
red
-
face
,
easy
-
looking
man
 
more
like
a
country
squire
than
a
lawyer
 
<EOS>
and
he
seem
to
be
both
surprised
and
amuse
by
my
application
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
of
his
father
's
copy
of
the
register
,
but
have
not
even
see
it
himself
.
<EOS>
It
have
never
be
inquire
after
,
and
it
be
no
doubt
in
the
strong
room
among
other
paper
that
have
not
be
disturb
since
his
father
's
death
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
(
Mr.
Wansborough
say
)
that
the
old
gentleman
be
not
alive
to
hear
his
precious
copy
ask
for
at
last
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
ride
his
favourite
hobby
harder
than
ever
now
.
<EOS>
how
have
I
come
to
hear
of
the
copy
?
<EOS>
be
it
through
anybody
in
the
town
?
  
<EOS>
I
parry
the
question
as
well
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
at
this
stage
of
the
investigation
to
be
too
cautious
,
and
it
be
just
as
well
not
to
let
Mr.
Wansborough
know
prematurely
that
I
have
already
examine
the
original
register
.
<EOS>
I
describe
myself
,
therefore
,
as
pursue
a
family
inquiry
,
to
the
object
of
which
every
possible
saving
of
time
be
of
great
importance
.
<EOS>
I
be
anxious
to
send
certain
particular
to
London
by
that
day
's
post
,
and
one
look
at
the
duplicate
register
(
pay
,
of
course
,
the
necessary
fee
)
may
supply
what
I
require
,
and
save
me
a
further
journey
to
Old
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
I
add
that
,
in
the
event
of
my
subsequently
require
a
copy
of
the
original
register
,
I
should
make
application
to
Mr.
Wansborough
's
office
to
furnish
me
with
the
document
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
explanation
no
objection
be
make
to
produce
the
copy
.
<EOS>
a
clerk
be
send
to
the
strong
room
,
and
after
some
delay
return
with
the
volume
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
exactly
the
same
size
as
the
volume
in
the
vestry
,
the
only
difference
be
that
the
copy
be
more
smartly
bind
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
with
me
to
an
unoccupied
desk
.
<EOS>
My
hand
be
tremble
 
my
head
be
burn
hot
 
<EOS>
I
feel
the
necessity
of
conceal
my
agitation
as
well
as
I
could
from
the
person
about
me
in
the
room
,
before
I
venture
on
open
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
blank
page
at
the
beginning
,
to
which
I
first
turn
,
be
trace
some
line
in
fade
ink
.
<EOS>
They
contain
these
word

<EOS>
I
turn
to
the
month
of
September
,
eighteen
hundred
and
three
.
<EOS>
I
find
the
marriage
of
the
man
whose
christian
name
be
the
same
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
find
the
double
register
of
the
marriage
of
the
two
brother
.
<EOS>
and
between
these
entry
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
?
  
<EOS>
nothing
!
<EOS>
not
a
vestige
of
the
entry
which
record
the
marriage
of
Sir
Felix
Glyde
and
Cecilia
Jane
Elster
in
the
register
of
the
church
!
  
<EOS>
My
heart
give
a
great
bound
,
and
throb
as
if
it
would
stifle
me
.
<EOS>
I
look
again
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
to
believe
the
evidence
of
my
own
eye
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
not
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
the
marriage
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
the
entry
on
the
copy
occupy
exactly
the
same
place
on
the
page
as
the
entry
in
the
original
.
<EOS>
the
last
entry
on
one
page
record
the
marriage
of
the
man
with
my
christian
name
.
<EOS>
below
it
there
be
a
blank
space
 
<EOS>
a
space
evidently
leave
because
it
be
too
narrow
to
contain
the
entry
of
the
marriage
of
the
two
brother
,
which
in
the
copy
,
as
in
the
original
,
occupy
the
top
of
the
next
page
.
<EOS>
that
space
tell
the
whole
story
!
<EOS>
there
it
must
have
remain
in
the
church
register
from
eighteen
hundred
and
three
(
when
the
marriage
have
be
solemnise
and
the
copy
have
be
make
)
to
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
seven
,
when
Sir
Percival
appear
at
Old
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
here
,
at
Knowlesbury
,
be
the
chance
of
commit
the
forgery
show
to
me
in
the
copy
,
and
there
,
at
Old
Welmingham
,
be
the
forgery
commit
in
the
register
of
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
My
head
turn
giddy
 
<EOS>
I
hold
by
the
desk
to
keep
myself
from
fall
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
suspicion
which
have
strike
me
in
relation
to
that
desperate
man
,
not
one
have
be
near
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
the
idea
that
he
be
not
Sir
Percival
Glyde
at
all
,
that
he
have
no
more
claim
to
the
baronetcy
and
to
Blackwater
Park
than
the
poor
labourer
who
work
on
the
estate
,
have
never
once
occur
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
I
have
think
he
may
be
Anne
Catherick
's
father
 
at
another
time
I
have
think
he
may
have
be
<EOS>
Anne
Catherick
's
husband
 
the
offence
of
which
he
be
really
guilty
have
be
,
from
first
to
last
,
beyond
the
wide
reach
of
my
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
the
paltry
mean
by
which
the
fraud
have
be
effect
,
the
magnitude
and
daring
of
the
crime
that
it
represent
,
the
horror
of
the
consequence
involve
in
its
discovery
,
overwhelm
me
.
<EOS>
who
could
wonder
now
at
the
brute
-
restlessness
of
the
wretch
's
life
 
at
his
desperate
alternation
between
abject
duplicity
and
reckless
violence
 
at
the
madness
of
guilty
distrust
which
have
make
him
imprison
Anne
Catherick
in
the
Asylum
,
and
have
give
him
over
to
the
vile
conspiracy
against
his
wife
,
on
the
bare
suspicion
that
the
one
and
the
other
know
his
terrible
secret
?
<EOS>
the
disclosure
of
that
secret
may
,
in
past
year
,
have
hang
him
 
may
now
transport
him
for
life
.
<EOS>
the
disclosure
of
that
secret
,
even
if
the
sufferer
by
his
deception
spare
him
the
penalty
of
the
law
,
would
deprive
him
at
one
blow
of
the
name
,
the
rank
,
the
estate
,
the
whole
social
existence
that
he
have
usurp
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
Secret
,
and
it
be
mine
!
<EOS>
a
word
from
me
,
and
house
,
land
,
baronetcy
,
be
go
from
him
for
ever
 
a
word
from
me
,
and
he
be
drive
out
into
the
world
,
a
nameless
,
penniless
,
friendless
outcast
!
<EOS>
the
man
's
whole
future
hang
on
my
lip
 
<EOS>
and
he
know
it
by
this
time
as
certainly
as
I
do
!
  
<EOS>
that
last
thought
steady
me
.
<EOS>
interest
far
more
precious
than
my
own
depend
on
the
caution
which
must
now
guide
my
slight
action
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
possible
treachery
which
Sir
Percival
may
not
attempt
against
me
.
<EOS>
in
the
danger
and
desperation
of
his
position
he
would
be
stagger
by
no
risk
,
he
would
recoil
at
no
crime
 
he
would
literally
hesitate
at
nothing
to
save
himself
.
  
<EOS>
I
consider
for
a
minute
.
<EOS>
My
first
necessity
be
to
secure
positive
evidence
in
writing
of
the
discovery
that
I
have
just
make
,
and
in
the
event
of
any
personal
misadventure
happen
to
me
,
to
place
that
evidence
beyond
Sir
Percival
's
reach
.
<EOS>
the
copy
of
the
register
be
sure
to
be
safe
in
Mr.
Wansborough
's
strong
room
.
<EOS>
but
the
position
of
the
original
in
the
vestry
be
,
as
I
have
see
with
my
own
eye
,
anything
but
secure
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
emergency
I
resolve
to
return
to
the
church
,
to
apply
again
to
the
clerk
,
and
to
take
the
necessary
extract
from
the
register
before
I
sleep
that
night
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
then
aware
that
a
legally
-
certify
copy
be
necessary
,
and
that
no
document
merely
draw
out
by
myself
could
claim
the
proper
importance
as
a
proof
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
of
this
,
and
my
determination
to
keep
my
present
proceeding
a
secret
prevent
me
from
ask
any
question
which
may
have
procure
the
necessary
information
.
<EOS>
My
one
anxiety
be
the
anxiety
to
get
back
to
Old
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
I
make
the
good
excuse
I
could
for
the
discomposure
in
my
face
and
manner
which
Mr.
Wansborough
have
already
notice
,
lay
the
necessary
fee
on
his
table
,
arrange
that
I
should
write
to
him
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
leave
the
office
,
with
my
head
in
a
whirl
and
my
blood
throb
through
my
vein
at
fever
heat
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
just
get
dark
.
<EOS>
the
idea
occur
to
me
that
I
may
be
follow
again
and
attack
on
the
high
-
road
.
  
<EOS>
My
walking
-
stick
be
a
light
one
,
of
little
or
no
use
for
purpose
of
defence
.
<EOS>
I
stop
before
leave
Knowlesbury
and
buy
a
stout
country
cudgel
,
short
,
and
heavy
at
the
head
.
<EOS>
with
this
homely
weapon
,
if
any
one
man
try
to
stop
me
I
be
a
match
for
him
.
<EOS>
if
more
than
one
attack
me
I
could
trust
to
my
heel
.
<EOS>
in
my
school
-
day
I
have
be
a
note
runner
,
and
I
have
not
want
for
practice
since
in
the
later
time
of
my
experience
in
Central
America
.
  
<EOS>
I
start
from
the
town
at
a
brisk
pace
,
and
keep
the
middle
of
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
a
small
misty
rain
be
fall
,
and
it
be
impossible
for
the
first
half
of
the
way
to
make
sure
whether
I
be
follow
or
not
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
last
half
of
my
journey
,
when
I
suppose
myself
to
be
about
two
mile
from
the
church
,
I
see
a
man
run
by
me
in
the
rain
,
and
then
hear
the
gate
of
a
field
by
the
roadside
shut
to
sharply
.
<EOS>
I
keep
straight
on
,
with
my
cudgel
ready
in
my
hand
,
my
ear
on
the
alert
,
and
my
eye
strain
to
see
through
the
mist
and
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
before
I
have
advance
a
hundred
yard
there
be
a
rustling
in
the
hedge
on
my
right
,
and
three
man
spring
out
into
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
I
draw
aside
on
the
instant
to
the
footpath
.
<EOS>
the
two
foremost
man
be
carry
beyond
me
before
they
could
check
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
third
be
as
quick
as
lightning
.
<EOS>
He
stop
,
half
turned
,
and
strike
at
me
with
his
stick
.
<EOS>
the
blow
be
aim
at
hazard
,
and
be
not
a
severe
one
.
<EOS>
It
fall
on
my
left
shoulder
.
<EOS>
I
return
it
heavily
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
stagger
back
and
jostle
his
two
companion
just
as
they
be
both
rush
at
me
.
<EOS>
this
circumstance
give
me
a
moment
's
start
.
<EOS>
I
slip
by
them
,
and
take
to
the
middle
of
the
road
again
at
the
top
of
my
speed
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
unhurt
man
pursue
me
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
good
runner
 
<EOS>
the
road
be
smooth
and
level
,
and
for
the
first
five
minute
or
more
I
be
conscious
that
I
do
not
gain
on
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
perilous
work
to
run
for
long
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
could
barely
see
the
dim
black
line
of
the
hedge
on
either
side
,
and
any
chance
obstacle
in
the
road
would
have
throw
me
down
to
a
certainty
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
I
feel
the
ground
change
 
it
descend
from
the
level
at
a
turn
,
and
then
rise
again
beyond
.
<EOS>
downhill
the
man
rather
gain
on
me
,
but
uphill
<EOS>
I
begin
to
distance
them
.
<EOS>
the
rapid
,
regular
thump
of
their
foot
grow
fainter
on
my
ear
,
and
I
calculate
by
the
sound
that
I
be
far
enough
in
advance
to
take
to
the
field
with
a
good
chance
of
their
pass
me
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
diverge
to
the
footpath
,
I
make
for
the
first
break
that
I
could
guess
at
,
rather
than
see
,
in
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
It
prove
to
be
a
closed
gate
.
<EOS>
I
vault
over
,
and
find
myself
in
a
field
,
keep
across
it
steadily
with
my
back
to
the
road
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
man
pass
the
gate
,
still
run
,
then
in
a
minute
more
hear
one
of
them
call
to
the
other
to
come
back
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
matter
what
they
do
now
<EOS>
,
I
be
out
of
their
sight
and
out
of
their
hearing
.
<EOS>
I
keep
straight
across
the
field
,
and
when
I
have
reach
the
farth
extremity
of
it
,
wait
there
for
a
minute
to
recover
my
breath
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
venture
back
to
the
road
,
but
I
be
determine
nevertheless
to
get
to
Old
Welmingham
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
neither
moon
nor
star
appear
to
guide
me
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
I
have
keep
the
wind
and
rain
at
my
back
on
leave
Knowlesbury
,
and
if
I
now
keep
them
at
my
back
still
,
I
may
at
least
be
certain
of
not
advance
altogether
in
the
wrong
direction
.
  
<EOS>
proceed
on
this
plan
,
I
cross
the
country
 
meeting
with
no
bad
obstacle
than
hedge
,
ditch
,
and
thicket
,
which
every
now
and
then
oblige
me
to
alter
my
course
for
a
little
while
 
until
I
find
myself
on
a
hill
-
side
,
with
the
ground
slope
away
steeply
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
descend
to
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
,
squeeze
my
way
through
a
hedge
,
and
get
out
into
a
lane
.
<EOS>
have
turn
to
the
right
on
leave
the
road
,
I
now
turn
to
the
left
,
on
the
chance
of
regain
the
line
from
which
I
have
wander
.
<EOS>
after
follow
the
muddy
winding
of
the
lane
for
ten
minute
or
more
,
I
see
a
cottage
with
a
light
in
one
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
the
garden
gate
be
open
to
the
lane
,
and
I
go
in
at
once
to
inquire
my
way
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
could
knock
at
the
door
it
be
suddenly
open
,
and
a
man
come
run
out
with
a
light
lantern
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
stop
and
hold
it
up
at
the
sight
of
me
.
<EOS>
We
both
start
as
we
see
each
other
.
<EOS>
My
wandering
have
lead
me
round
the
outskirt
of
the
village
,
and
have
bring
me
out
at
the
low
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
back
at
Old
Welmingham
,
and
the
man
with
the
lantern
be
no
other
than
my
acquaintance
of
the
morning
,
the
parish
clerk
.
  
<EOS>
His
manner
appear
to
have
alter
strangely
in
the
interval
since
I
have
last
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
look
suspicious
and
confused
 
his
ruddy
cheek
be
deeply
flush
 
and
<EOS>
his
first
word
,
when
he
speak
,
be
quite
unintelligible
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
the
key
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
take
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
key
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
this
moment
come
from
Knowlesbury
.
<EOS>
what
key
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
key
of
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
Lord
save
us
and
help
us
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
the
key
be
go
!
<EOS>
do
you
hear
?
"
cry
the
old
man
,
shake
the
lantern
at
me
in
his
agitation
,
"
the
key
be
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
?
<EOS>
when
?
<EOS>
who
can
have
take
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
the
clerk
,
stare
about
him
wildly
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
just
get
back
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
have
a
long
day
's
work
this
morning
 
<EOS>
I
lock
the
door
and
shut
the
window
down
 
<EOS>
it
be
open
now
,
the
window
's
open
.
<EOS>
look
!
<EOS>
somebody
have
get
in
there
and
take
the
key
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
turn
to
the
casement
window
to
show
me
that
it
be
wide
open
.
<EOS>
the
door
of
the
lantern
come
loose
from
its
fastening
as
he
sway
it
round
,
and
the
wind
blow
the
candle
out
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
get
another
light
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
let
us
both
go
to
the
vestry
together
.
<EOS>
quick
!
<EOS>
quick
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hurry
him
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
treachery
that
I
have
every
reason
to
expect
,
the
treachery
that
may
deprive
me
of
every
advantage
I
have
gain
,
be
at
that
moment
,
perhaps
,
in
process
of
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
My
impatience
to
reach
the
church
be
so
great
that
I
could
not
remain
inactive
in
the
cottage
while
the
clerk
light
the
lantern
again
.
<EOS>
I
walk
out
,
down
the
garden
path
,
into
the
lane
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
have
advance
ten
pace
a
man
approach
me
from
the
direction
lead
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
He
speak
respectfully
as
we
meet
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
his
face
,
but
judge
by
his
voice
only
,
he
be
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
Percival
 
<EOS>
"
he
begin
.
  
<EOS>
I
stop
him
before
he
could
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
"

I
say
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
I

"
he
mutter
,
in
a
confused
,
doubtful
way
.
  
<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
to

lane
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
answer
he
retrace
his
step
.
<EOS>
I
look
back
at
the
cottage
and
see
the
clerk
come
out
,
with
the
lantern
light
once
more
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
old
man
's
arm
to
help
him
on
the
more
quickly
.
<EOS>
We
hasten
along
the
lane
,
and
pass
the
person
who
have
accost
me
.
<EOS>
as
well
as
I
could
see
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
,
he
be
a
servant
out
of
livery
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
that
?
"
whisper
the
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
he
know
anything
about
the
key
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
wait
to
ask
him
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
on
to
the
vestry
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
church
be
not
visible
,
even
by
daytime
,
until
the
end
of
the
lane
be
reach
.
<EOS>
as
we
mount
the
rise
ground
which
lead
to
the
building
from
that
point
,
one

<EOS>

I

"
We

<EOS>

and

"
  
<EOS>
I
mount
the
hill
rapidly
.
<EOS>
the
dark
mass
of
the
church
-
tower
be
the
first
object
I
discern
dimly
against
the
night
sky
.
<EOS>
as
I
turn
aside
to
get
round
to
the
vestry
,
I
hear
heavy
footstep
close
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
servant
have
ascend
to
the
church
after
us
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

,
when
I
turn
round
on
him
,
"
I

"
<EOS>
the
tone
in
which
he
speak
betray
unmistakable
fear
.
<EOS>
I
take
no
notice
of
him
and
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
the
instant
I
turn
the
corner
and
come
in
view
of
the
vestry
<EOS>
,
I
see
the
lantern
-
skylight
on
the
roof
brilliantly
light
up
from
within
.
<EOS>
It
shine
out
with
dazzle
brightness
against
the
murky
,
starless
sky
.
  
<EOS>
I
hurry
through
the
churchyard
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
get
near
there
be
a
strange
smell
steal
out
on
the
damp
night
air
.
<EOS>
I
hear
a
snapping
noise
inside
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
light
above
grow
bright
and
bright
 
<EOS>
a
pane
of
the
glass
crack
 
<EOS>
I
run
to
the
door
and
put
my
hand
on
it
.
<EOS>
the
vestry
be
on
fire
!
  
<EOS>
before
I
could
move
,
before
I
could
draw
my
breath
after
that
discovery
,
I
be
horror
-
strike
by
a
heavy
thump
against
the
door
from
the
inside
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
key
work
violently
in
the
lock
 
<EOS>
I
hear
a
man
's
voice
behind
the
door
,
raise
to
a
dreadful
shrillness
,
scream
for
help
.
  
<EOS>
the
servant
who
have
follow
me
stagger
back
shuddering
,
and
drop
to
his
knee
.
<EOS>
"

as

word

his
lip
the

us
,
and
at
the

moment
there
be
another
and
a
last
grating
turn
of
the
key
in
the
lock

absorb
purpose
that

fill
all
my

that
have
control
all

for
week

inflict
 
of
the
love

the
innocence

the
happiness

pitilessly
lay
waste
 
of

oath
I

swear
in
my

heart
to
summon
him
to
the
terrible
reckoning
that
he
deserve
 
pass
from
my
memory
like
a
dream

<EOS>
I
remember
nothing
but
the
horror
of
his
situation
.
<EOS>
I
feel
nothing
but
the
natural
human
impulse
to
save
him
from
a
frightful
death

You

"
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
renew
cry
for
help
when
the
key
be
turn
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sound
now
of
any
kind
,
to
give
token
that
he
be
still
alive
.
<EOS>
I
hear
nothing
but
the
quicken
crackle
of
the
flame
,
and
the
sharp
snap
of
the
glass
in
the
skylight
above
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
round
at
my
two
companion
.
<EOS>
the
servant
have
rise
to
his
foot
 
he
have
take
the
lantern
,
and
be
hold
it
up
vacantly
at
the
door

<EOS>
Terror
seem
to
have
strike
him
with
downright
idiocy
 
<EOS>
he
wait
at
my
heel

me
about
when
I
move
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
the
clerk
sit
crouch
up
on
one
of
the
tombstone
,
shiver
,
and
moan
to
himself
.
<EOS>
the
one
moment
in
which
I
look
at
them
be
enough
to
show
me
that
they
be
both
helpless
.
  
<EOS>
hardly
know
what
I
do
,
act
desperately
on
the
first
impulse
that
occur
to
me
,
I
seize
the
servant
and
push
him
against
the
vestry
wall
.
"
<EOS>
stoop
!

I
say
,

and
hold
by

stone

climb
over
you
to
the
roof
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
break
the
skylight

and
give
him
some
air
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
man
tremble
from
head
to
foot
,
but
he
hold
firm
.
<EOS>
I
get
on
his
back
,
with
my
cudgel
in
my
mouth
,
seize
the
parapet
with
both
hand
,
and
be
instantly
on
the
roof

<EOS>
in
the
frantic
hurry
and
agitation
of
the
moment
,
it
never
strike
me
that
I
may
let
out
the
flame
instead
of
let
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
I
strike
at
the
skylight
,
and
batter
in
the
cracked
,
loosen
glass
at
a
blow
.
<EOS>
the
fire
leap
out
like
a
wild
beast
from
its
lair

<EOS>
if
the
wind
have
not
chance

in
the
position
I
occupy
,
to
set
it
away
from
me
,
my
exertion
may
have
end
then
and
there
.
<EOS>
I
crouch
on
the
roof
as
the
smoke
pour
out
above
me
with
the
flame
.
<EOS>
the
gleam
and
flash
of
the
light
show
me
the
servant
's
face
stare
up
vacantly
under
the
wall
 
<EOS>
the
clerk
rise
to
his
foot
on
the
tombstone
,
wring
his
hand
in
despair
 
and
the
scanty
population
of
the
village
,
haggard
man
and
terrified
woman
,
cluster
beyond
in
the
churchyard
 
<EOS>
all
appear
and
disappear
,
in
the
red
of
the
dreadful
glare

in
the
black
of
the
choking
smoke

<EOS>
and
the
man
beneath
my
foot

<EOS>
the
man

suffocate
,
burn
,
die
so
near
us
all
,
so
utterly
beyond
our
reach

<EOS>
the
thought
half
madden
me
.
<EOS>
I
lower
myself
from
the
roof
,
by
my
hand
,
and
drop
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
key

I
shout
to
the
clerk

"
We
must
try
it
that
way

we
may

him
yet

cry
the
old
man

no

say
a
voice
from
among
the
man
behind

I
call
to
that
man

have
his
wit
about
him
 
<EOS>
I
call
to
him
to
come
and
speak
to
me

<EOS>
It
would
be
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
least
before
the
town
engine
could
reach
us
.
<EOS>
the
horror
of
remain
inactive
all
that
time
be
more
than
I
could
face
.
<EOS>
in
defiance
of
my
own
reason
I
persuade
myself
that
the
doom
and
lose
wretch
in
the
vestry
may
still
be
lie
senseless
on
the
floor
,
may
not
be
dead
yet
.
<EOS>
if
we
break
open
the
door
,
may
we
save
him
?
<EOS>
I
know
the
strength
of
the
heavy
lock
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
thickness
of
the
nail
oak
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
hopelessness
of
assail
the
one
and
the
other
by
ordinary
mean
.
<EOS>
but
surely
there
be
beam
still
leave
in
the
dismantle
cottage
near
the
church
?
<EOS>
what
if
we
get
one
,
and
use
it
as
a
battering
-
ram
against
the
door
?
  
<EOS>
the
thought
leap
through
me
like
the
fire
leap
out
of
the
shatter
skylight
.
<EOS>
I
appeal
to
the
man
who
have
speak
first
of
the
fire
-
engine
in
the
town
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
get
your
pickaxe
handy
?
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
have
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
a
hatchet
,
and
a
saw
,
and
a
bit
of
rope
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
I
run
down
among
the
villager
,
with
the
lantern
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
five
shilling
apiece
to
every
man
who
help
me
!
"
<EOS>
They
start
into
life
at
the
word
.
<EOS>
that
ravenous
second
hunger
of
poverty
 
the
hunger
for
money
 
rouse
them
into
tumult
and
activity
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
two
of
you
for
more
lantern
,
if
you
have
them
!
<EOS>
two
of
you
for
the
pickaxe
and
the
tool
!
<EOS>
the
rest
after
me
to
find
the
beam
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
They
cheer
 
with
shrill
starveling
voice
they
cheer
.
<EOS>
the
woman
and
the
child
flee
back
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
We
rush
in
a
body
down
the
churchyard
path
to
the
first
empty
cottage
.
<EOS>
not
a
man
be
leave
behind
but
the
clerk
 
the
poor
old
clerk
stand
on
the
flat
tombstone
sob
and
wail
over
the
church
.
<EOS>
the
servant
be
still
at
my
heel
 
<EOS>
his
white
,
helpless
,
panic
-
stricken
face
be
close
over
my
shoulder
as
we
push
into
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
there
be
rafter
from
the
tear
-
down
floor
above
,
lie
loose
on
the
ground
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
too
light
.
<EOS>
a
beam
run
across
over
our
head
,
but
not
out
of
reach
of
our
arm
and
our
pickaxe
 
a
beam
fast
at
each
end
in
the
ruin
wall
,
with
ceiling
and
floor
all
rip
away
,
and
a
great
gap
in
the
roof
above
,
open
to
the
sky
.
<EOS>
We
attack
the
beam
at
both
end
at
once
.
<EOS>
God
!
<EOS>
how
it
hold
 
how
the
brick
and
mortar
of
the
wall
resist
us

<EOS>
We

,
and
tear
.
<EOS>
the
beam
give
at
one
end
 
it
come
down
with
a
lump
of
brickwork
after
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
scream
from
the
woman
all
huddle
in
the
doorway
to
look
at
us
 
a
shout
from
the
man
 
<EOS>
two
of
them
down
but
not
hurt
.
<EOS>
another
tug
all
together
 
<EOS>
and
the
beam
be
loose
at
both
end
.
<EOS>
We
raise
it
,
and
give
the
word
to
clear
the
doorway
.
<EOS>
now
for
the
work
!
<EOS>
now
for
the
rush
at
the
door

<EOS>
there
be
the
fire
stream
into
the
sky
,
stream
brighter
than
ever
to
light
us
!
<EOS>
steady
along
the
churchyard
path
 
steady
with
the
beam
for
a
rush
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
one
,
two
,
three
 
and

<EOS>
out

the
cheering

,
irrepressibly

<EOS>
We

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
the
stealthy
fire
dart
at
us
through
the
crevice
all
round
it
.
<EOS>
another
,
and
a
last
rush
!
<EOS>
the
door
fall
in
with
a
crash
.
<EOS>
a
great
hush
of
awe
,
a
stillness
of
breathless
expectation
,
possess
every
live
soul
of
us
.
<EOS>
We
look
for
the
body
.
<EOS>
the
scorch
heat
on
our
face
drive
us
back
:
we
see
nothing
 
above
,
below
,
all
through
the
room
,
we
see
nothing
but
a
sheet
of
live
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
he
?
<EOS>
"
whisper
the
servant
,
stare
vacantly
at
the
flame
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
dust
and
ashe
,
"
say
the
clerk
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
book
be
dust
and
ashe
 
<EOS>
and
oh

sir
!
<EOS>
the
church
will
be
dust
and
ashe
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
those
be
the
only
two
who
speak
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
silent
again
,
nothing
stir
in
the
stillness
but
the
bubble
and
the
crackle
of
the
flame
.
  
<EOS>
Hark
!
  
<EOS>
a
harsh
rattling
sound
in
the
distance
 
then
the
hollow
beat
of
horse
'
hoofs
at
full
gallop
 
<EOS>
then
the
low
roar
,
the
all
-
predominant
tumult
of
hundred
of
human
voice
clamour
and
shout
together
.
<EOS>
the
engine
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
about
me
all
turn
from
the
fire
,
and
run
eagerly
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
the
old
clerk
try
to
go
with
the
rest
,
but
his
strength
be
exhaust
.
<EOS>
I
see
him
hold
by
one
of
the
tombstone
.
<EOS>
"
save
the
church
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
out
faintly
,
as
if
the
fireman
could
hear
him
already
.
  
<EOS>
save
the
church
!
  
<EOS>
the
only
man
who
never
move
be
the
servant
.
<EOS>
there
he
stand
,
his
eye
still
fasten
on
the
flame
in
a
changeless
,
vacant
stare
.
<EOS>
I
speak
to
him
,
I
shake
him
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
He
be
past
rousing
.
<EOS>
He
only
whisper
once
more
,
"
where
be
he

"
  
<EOS>
in
ten
minute
the
engine
be
in
position
,
the
well
at
the
back
of
the
church
be
feed

and
the
hose

the
doorway
of
the
vestry

<EOS>
if
help
have

<EOS>
My
energy
of

exhaust
 
<EOS>
the
turmoil
of
my
thought
be
fearfully
and
suddenly
still
,
now
I
know
that
he

<EOS>
I
stand
useless
and
helpless
 
look
,
look
,
look
into
the
burning
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
the
fire
slowly
conquer
.
<EOS>
the
brightness
of
the
glare
fade
 
<EOS>
the
steam
rise
in
white
cloud
,
and
the
smouldering
heap
of
ember
show
red
and
black
through
it
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
 
then
an
advance
all
together
of
the
fireman
and
the
police
which
block
up
the
doorway
 
then
a
consultation
in
low
voice
 
<EOS>
and
then
two
man

detach
from
the
rest

and
send
out
of
the
churchyard
through
the
crowd

<EOS>
the
crowd
draw
back
on
either
side
in
dead
silence
to
let
them
pass

<EOS>
after
a
while

great
shudder

through
the
people

<EOS>
They

I
be
unable

to
him
,
I
be
unable
to
resist
him
when
he
take
my
arm
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
say
that
I
have
never

the
dead
man
in
his
lifetime
 
<EOS>
that
there
be
no
hope
of
identify
him
by

<EOS>
but
the
word
fail
on
my
lip

<EOS>
I
be
faint
,
and
silent
,
and
helpless
.
  
<EOS>
"
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be

inside
a
circle
of
man
.
<EOS>
three
of
them
opposite
to
me
be
hold
lantern
low
down
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Their
eye
,
and
the
eye
of
all
the
rest
,
be
fix
silently
and
expectantly
on
my
face
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
be
at
my
foot
 
<EOS>
I
know
why
they
be

the
lantern
so
low
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
identify
him
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
My
eye
drop
slowly
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
see
nothing
under
them
but
a
coarse
canvas
cloth
.
<EOS>
the
dripping
of
the
rain
on
it
be
audible
in
the
dreadful
silence
.
<EOS>
I
look
up
,
along
the
cloth
,
and
there
at
the
end
,
stark
and
grim
and
black
,
in
the
yellow
light
 
there
be
his
dead
face
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
for
the
first
and
last
time
,
I
see
him
.
<EOS>
so
the
visitation
of
God
rule
it
that
he
and
I
should
meet
.
    
<EOS>
the
inquest
be
hurry
for
certain
local
reason
which
weigh
with
the
coroner
and
the
town
authority
.
<EOS>
It
be
hold
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
I
be
necessarily
one
among
the
witness
summon
to
assist
the
object
of
the
investigation
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
proceeding
in
the
morning
be
to
go
to
the
post
-
office
,
and
inquire
for
the
letter
which
I
expect
from
Marian
.
<EOS>
no
change
of
circumstance
,
however
extraordinary
,
could
affect
the
one
great
anxiety
which
weigh
on
my
mind
while
I
be
away
from
London
.
<EOS>
the
morning
's
letter
,
which
be
the
only
assurance
I
could
receive
that
no
misfortune
have
happen
in
my
absence
,
be
still
the
absorb
interest
with
which
my
day
begin
.
  
<EOS>
to
my
relief
,
the
letter
from
Marian
be
at
the
office
wait
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
have
happen
 
they
be
both
as
safe
and
as
well
as
when
I
have
leave
them
.
<EOS>
Laura
send
her
love
,
and
beg
that
I
would
let
her
know
of
my
return
a
day
beforehand
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
add
,
in
explanation
of
this
message
,
that
she
have
save
"
nearly
a
sovereign
"
out
of
her
own
private
purse
,
and
that
she
have
claim
the
privilege
of
order
the
dinner
and
give
the
dinner
which
be
to
celebrate
the
day
of
my
return
.
<EOS>
I
read
these
little
domestic
confidence
in
the
bright
morning
with
the
terrible
recollection
of
what
have
happen
the
evening
before
vivid
in
my
memory
.
<EOS>
the
necessity
of
spare
Laura
any
sudden
knowledge
of
the
truth
be
the
first
consideration
which
the
letter
suggest
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
write
at
once
to
Marian
to
tell
her
what
I
have
tell
in
these
page
 
present
the
tiding
as
gradually
and
gently
as
I
could
,
and
warn
her
not
to
let
any
such
thing
as
a
newspaper
fall
in
Laura
's
way
while
I
be
absent
.
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
any
other
woman
,
less
courageous
and
less
reliable
,
I
may
have
hesitate
before
I
venture
on
unreservedly
disclose
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
but
I
owe
it
to
Marian
to
be
faithful
to
my
past
experience
of
her
,
and
to
trust
her
as
I
trust
herself
.
  
<EOS>
My
letter
be
necessarily
a
long
one
.
<EOS>
It
occupy
me
until
the
time
come
for
proceed
to
the
inquest
.
  
<EOS>
the
object
of
the
legal
inquiry
be
necessarily
beset
by
peculiar
complication
and
difficulty
.
<EOS>
besides
the
investigation
into
the
manner
in
which
the
deceased
have
meet
his
death
,
there
be
serious
question
to
be
settle
relate
to
the
cause
of
the
fire
,
to
the
abstraction
of
the
key
,
and
to
the
presence
of
a
stranger
in
the
vestry
at
the
time
when
the
flame
break
out
.
<EOS>
even
the
identification
of
the
dead
man
have
not
yet
be
accomplish
.
<EOS>
the
helpless
condition
of
the
servant
have
make
the
police
distrustful
of
his
assert
recognition
of
his
master
.
<EOS>
They
have
send
to
Knowlesbury
overnight
to
secure
the
attendance
of
witness
who
be
well
acquaint
with
the
personal
appearance
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
and
they
have
communicate
,
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
,
with
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
these
precaution
enable
the
coroner
and
jury
to
settle
the
question
of
identity
,
and
to
confirm
the
correctness
of
the
servant
's
assertion
;
the
evidence
offer
by
competent
witness
,
and
by
the
discovery
of
certain
fact
,
be
subsequently
strengthen
by
an
examination
of
the
dead
man
's
watch
.
<EOS>
the
crest
and
the
name
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
be
engrave
inside
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
inquiry
relate
to
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
the
servant
and
I
,
and
the
boy
who
have
hear
the
light
strike
in
the
vestry
,
be
the
first
witness
call
.
<EOS>
the
boy
give
his
evidence
clearly
enough
,
but
the
servant
's
mind
have
not
yet
recover
the
shock
inflict
on
it
 
<EOS>
he
be
plainly
incapable
of
assist
the
object
of
the
inquiry
,
and
he
be
desire
to
stand
down
.
  
<EOS>
to
my
own
relief
,
my
examination
be
not
a
long
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
know
the
deceased
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
him
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
of
his
presence
at
Old
Welmingham
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
not
be
in
the
vestry
at
the
finding
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
all
I
could
prove
be
that
I
have
stop
at
the
clerk
's
cottage
to
ask
my
way
 
that
I
have
hear
from
him
of
the
loss
of
the
key
 
that
I
have
accompany
him
to
the
church
to
render
what
help
<EOS>
I
could
 
that
I
have
see
the
fire
 
that
I
have
hear
some
person
unknown
,
inside
the
vestry
,
try
vainly
to
unlock
the
door
 
and
that
I
have
do
what
I
could
,
from
motive
of
humanity
,
to
save
the
man
.
<EOS>
other
witness
,
who
have
be
acquaint
with
the
deceased
,
be
ask
if
they
could
explain
the
mystery
of
his
presume
abstraction
of
the
key
,
and
his
presence
in
the
burning
room
.
<EOS>
but
the
coroner
seem
to
take
it
for
grant
,
naturally
enough
,
that
I
,
as
a
total
stranger
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
a
total
stranger
to
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
could
not
be
in
a
position
to
offer
any
evidence
on
these
two
point
.
  
<EOS>
the
course
that
I
be
myself
bind
to
take
,
when
my
formal
examination
have
close
,
seem
clear
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
feel
call
on
to
volunteer
any
statement
of
my
own
private
conviction
;
in
the
first
place
,
because
my
do
so
could
serve
no
practical
purpose
,
now
that
all
proof
in
support
of
any
surmise
of
mine
be
burn
with
the
burn
register
;
in
the
second
place
,
because
I
could
not
have
intelligibly
state
my
opinion
 
my
unsupported
opinion
 
without
disclose
the
whole
story
of
the
conspiracy
,
and
produce
beyond
a
doubt
the
same
unsatisfactory
effect
an
the
mind
of
the
coroner
and
the
jury
,
which
I
have
already
produce
on
the
mind
of
Mr.
Kyrle
.
  
<EOS>
in
these
page
,
however
,
and
after
the
time
that
have
now
elapse
,
no
such
caution
and
restraint
as
be
here
describe
need
fetter
the
free
expression
of
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
will
state
briefly
,
before
my
pen
occupy
itself
with
other
event
,
how
my
own
conviction
lead
me
to
account
for
the
abstraction
of
the
key
,
for
the
outbreak
of
the
fire
,
and
for
the
death
of
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
the
news
of
my
be
free
on
bail
drive
Sir
Percival
,
as
I
believe
,
to
his
last
resource
.
<EOS>
the
attempt
attack
on
the
road
be
one
of
those
resource
,
and
the
suppression
of
all
practical
proof
of
his
crime
,
by
destroy
the
page
of
the
register
on
which
the
forgery
have
be
commit
,
be
the
other
,
and
the
sure
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
produce
no
extract
from
the
original
book
to
compare
with
the
certify
copy
at
Knowlesbury
,
I
could
produce
no
positive
evidence
,
and
could
threaten
him
with
no
fatal
exposure
.
<EOS>
all
that
be
necessary
to
the
attainment
of
his
end
be
,
that
he
should
get
into
the
vestry
unperceive
,
that
he
should
tear
out
the
page
in
the
register
,
and
that
he
should
leave
the
vestry
again
as
privately
as
he
have
enter
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
supposition
,
it
be
easy
to
understand
why
he
wait
until
nightfall
before
he
make
the
attempt
,
and
why
he
take
advantage
of
the
clerk
's
absence
to
possess
himself
of
the
key
.
<EOS>
necessity
would
oblige
him
to
strike
a
light
to
find
his
way
to
the
right
register
,
and
common
caution
would
suggest
his
lock
the
door
on
the
inside
in
case
of
intrusion
on
the
part
of
any
inquisitive
stranger
,
or
on
my
part
,
if
I
happen
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
at
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
believe
that
it
be
any
part
of
his
intention
to
make
the
destruction
of
the
register
appear
to
be
the
result
of
accident
,
by
purposely
set
the
vestry
on
fire
.
<EOS>
the
bare
chance
that
prompt
assistance
may
arrive
,
and
that
the
book
may
,
by
the
remote
possibility
,
be
save
,
would
have
be
enough
,
on
a
moment
's
consideration
,
to
dismiss
any
idea
of
this
sort
from
his
mind
.
<EOS>
remember
the
quantity
of
combustible
object
in
the
vestry
 
<EOS>
the
straw
,
the
paper
,
the
packing
-
case
,
the
dry
wood
,
the
old
worm
-
eat
press
 
all
the
probability
,
in
my
estimation
,
point
to
the
fire
as
the
result
of
an
accident
with
his
match
or
his
light
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
,
under
these
circumstance
,
be
doubtless
to
try
to
extinguish
the
flame
,
and
fail
in
that
,
his
second
impulse
(
ignorant
as
he
be
of
the
state
of
the
lock
)
have
be
to
attempt
to
escape
by
the
door
which
have
give
him
entrance
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
call
to
him
,
the
flame
must
have
reach
across
the
door
lead
into
the
church
,
on
either
side
of
which
the
press
extend
,
and
close
to
which
the
other
combustible
object
be
place
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
the
smoke
and
flame
(
confine
as
they
be
to
the
room
)
have
be
too
much
for
him
when
he
try
to
escape
by
the
inner
door
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
drop
in
his
death
-
swoon
 
<EOS>
he
must
have
sink
in
the
place
where
he
be
find
 
just
as
I
get
on
the
roof
to
break
the
skylight
window
.
<EOS>
even
if
we
have
be
able
,
afterwards
,
to
get
into
the
church
,
and
to
burst
open
the
door
from
that
side
,
the
delay
must
have
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
past
saving
,
long
past
saving
,
by
that
time
.
<EOS>
We
should
only
have
give
the
flame
free
ingress
into
the
church
 
<EOS>
the
church
,
which
be
now
preserve
,
but
which
,
in
that
event
,
would
have
share
the
fate
of
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
in
my
mind
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
any
one
,
that
he
be
a
dead
man
before
ever
we
get
to
the
empty
cottage
,
and
work
with
might
and
main
to
tear
down
the
beam
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
near
approach
that
any
theory
of
mine
can
make
towards
account
for
a
result
which
be
visible
matter
of
fact
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
describe
them
,
so
event
pass
to
us
outside
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
relate
it
,
so
his
body
be
find
.
  
<EOS>
the
inquest
be
adjourn
over
one
day
 
no
explanation
that
the
eye
of
the
law
could
recognise
have
be
discover
thus
far
to
account
for
the
mysterious
circumstance
of
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
arrange
that
more
witness
should
be
summon
,
and
that
the
London
solicitor
of
the
deceased
should
be
invite
to
attend
.
<EOS>
a
medical
man
be
also
charge
with
the
duty
of
report
on
the
mental
condition
of
the
servant
,
which
appear
at
present
to
debar
him
from
give
any
evidence
of
the
least
importance
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
declare
,
in
a
dazed
way
,
that
he
have
be
order
,
on
the
night
of
the
fire
,
to
wait
in
the
lane
,
and
that
he
know
nothing
else
,
except
that
the
deceased
be
certainly
his
master
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
impression
be
,
that
he
have
be
first
use
(
without
any
guilty
knowledge
on
his
own
part
)
to
ascertain
the
fact
of
the
clerk
's
absence
from
home
on
the
previous
day
,
and
that
he
have
be
afterwards
order
to
wait
near
the
church
(
but
out
of
sight
of
the
vestry
)
to
assist
his
master
,
in
the
event
of
my
escape
the
attack
on
the
road
,
and
of
a
collision
occur
between
Sir
Percival
and
myself
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
add
,
that
the
man
's
own
testimony
be
never
obtain
to
confirm
this
view
.
<EOS>
the
medical
report
of
him
declare
that
what
little
mental
faculty
he
possess
be
seriously
shake
;
nothing
satisfactory
be
extract
from
him
at
the
adjourn
inquest
,
and
for
aught
I
know
to
the
contrary
,
he
may
never
have
recover
to
this
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
return
to
the
hotel
at
Welmingham
so
jade
in
body
and
mind
,
so
weakened
and
depress
by
all
that
I
have
go
through
,
as
to
be
quite
unfit
to
endure
the
local
gossip
about
the
inquest
,
and
to
answer
the
trivial
question
that
the
talker
address
to
me
in
the
coffee
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
withdraw
from
my
scanty
dinner
to
my
cheap
garret
-
chamber
to
secure
myself
a
little
quiet
,
and
to
think
undisturbed
of
Laura
and
Marian
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
a
rich
man
I
would
have
go
back
to
London
,
and
would
have
comfort
myself
with
a
sight
of
the
two
dear
face
again
that
night
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
bind
to
appear
,
if
call
on
,
at
the
adjourn
inquest
,
and
doubly
bind
to
answer
my
bail
before
the
magistrate
at
Knowlesbury
.
<EOS>
Our
slender
resource
have
suffer
already
,
and
the
doubtful
future
 
more
doubtful
than
<EOS>
ever
now
 
make
me
dread
decrease
our
mean
unnecessarily
by
allow
myself
an
indulgence
even
at
the
small
cost
of
a
double
railway
journey
in
the
carriage
of
the
second
class
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
 
the
day
immediately
follow
the
inquest
 
be
leave
at
my
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
I
begin
the
morning
by
again
apply
at
the
post
-
office
for
my
regular
report
from
Marian
.
<EOS>
It
be
wait
for
me
as
before
,
and
it
be
write
throughout
in
good
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
read
the
letter
thankfully
,
and
then
set
forth
with
my
mind
at
ease
for
the
day
to
go
to
Old
Welmingham
,
and
to
view
the
scene
of
the
fire
by
the
morning
light
.
  
<EOS>
what
change
meet
me
when
I
get
there
!
  
<EOS>
through
all
the
way
of
our
unintelligible
world
the
trivial
and
the
terrible
walk
hand
in
hand
together
.
<EOS>
the
irony
of
circumstance
hold
no
mortal
catastrophe
in
respect
.
<EOS>
when
I
reach
the
church
,
the
trampled
condition
of
the
burial
-
ground
be
the
only
serious
trace
leave
to
tell
of
the
fire
and
the
death
.
<EOS>
a
rough
hoarding
of
board
have
be
knock
up
before
the
vestry
doorway
.
<EOS>
rude
caricature
be
scrawl
on
it
already
,
and
the
village
child
be
fight
and
shout
for
the
possession
of
the
good
peep
-
hole
to
see
through
.
<EOS>
on
the
spot
where
I
have
hear
the
cry
for
help
from
the
burning
room
,
on
the
spot
where
the
panic
-
stricken
servant
have
drop
on
his
knee
,
a
fussy
flock
of
poultry
be
now
scramble
for
the
first
choice
of
worm
after
the
rain
;
and
on
the
ground
at
my
foot
,
where
the
door
and
its
dreadful
burden
have
be
lay
,
a
workman
's
dinner
be
wait
for
him
,
tie
up
in
a
yellow
basin
,
and
his
faithful
cur
in
charge
be
yelping
at
me
for
come
near
the
food
.
<EOS>
the
old
clerk
,
look
idly
at
the
slow
commencement
of
the
repair
,
have
only
one
interest
that
he
could
talk
about
now
 
the
interest
of
escape
all
blame
for
his
own
part
on
account
of
the
accident
that
have
happen
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
village
woman
,
whose
white
wild
face
<EOS>
I
remember
the
picture
of
terror
when
we
pull
down
the
beam
,
be
giggle
with
another
woman
,
the
picture
of
inanity
,
over
an
old
washing
-
tub
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
serious
in
mortality
!
<EOS>
Solomon
in
all
his
glory
be
Solomon
with
the
element
of
the
contemptible
lurk
in
every
fold
of
his
robe
and
in
every
corner
of
his
palace
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
leave
the
place
,
my
thought
turn
,
not
for
the
first
time
,
to
the
complete
overthrow
that
all
present
hope
of
establish
Laura
's
identity
have
now
suffer
through
Sir
Percival
's
death
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
 
and
with
him
the
chance
be
go
which
have
be
the
one
object
of
all
my
labour
and
all
my
hope
.
  
<EOS>
Could
I
look
at
my
failure
from
no
truer
point
of
view
than
this
?
  
<EOS>
suppose
he
have
live
,
would
that
change
of
circumstance
have
alter
the
result
?
<EOS>
Could
I
have
make
my
discovery
a
marketable
commodity
,
even
for
Laura
's
sake
,
after
I
have
find
out
that
robbery
of
the
right
of
other
be
the
essence
of
Sir
Percival
's
crime
?
<EOS>
Could
I
have
offer
the
price
of
my
silence
for
his
confession
of
the
conspiracy
,
when
the
effect
of
that
silence
must
have
be
to
keep
the
right
heir
from
the
estate
,
and
the
right
owner
from
the
name
?
<EOS>
impossible
!
<EOS>
if
Sir
Percival
have
live
,
the
discovery
,
from
which
(
in
my
ignorance
of
the
true
nature
of
the
Secret
)
I
have
hope
so
much
,
could
not
have
be
mine
to
suppress
or
to
make
public
,
as
I
think
best
,
for
the
vindication
of
Laura
's
right
.
<EOS>
in
common
honesty
and
common
honour
I
must
have
go
at
once
to
the
stranger
whose
birthright
have
be
usurped
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
renounce
the
victory
at
the
moment
when
it
be
mine
by
place
my
discovery
unreservedly
in
that
stranger
's
hand
 
<EOS>
and
I
must
have
face
afresh
all
the
difficulty
which
stand
between
me
and
the
one
object
of
my
life
,
exactly
as
I
be
resolve
in
my
heart
of
heart
to
face
them
now
!
  
<EOS>
I
return
to
Welmingham
with
my
mind
compose
,
feel
more
sure
of
myself
and
my
resolution
than
I
have
feel
yet
.
  
<EOS>
on
my
way
to
the
hotel
I
pass
the
end
of
the
square
in
which
Mrs.
Catherick
live
.
<EOS>
Should
I
go
back
to
the
house
,
and
make
another
attempt
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
that
news
of
Sir
Percival
's
death
,
which
be
the
last
news
she
ever
expect
to
hear
,
must
have
reach
her
hour
since
.
<EOS>
all
the
proceeding
at
the
inquest
have
be
report
in
the
local
paper
<EOS>
that
morning
 
there
be
nothing
I
could
tell
her
which
she
do
not
know
already
.
<EOS>
My
interest
in
make
her
speak
have
slacken
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
furtive
hatred
in
her
face
when
she
say
,
"
there
be
no
news
of
Sir
Percival
that
I
do
not
expect
 
except
the
news
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
the
stealthy
interest
in
her
eye
when
they
settle
on
me
at
parting
,
after
she
have
speak
those
word
.
<EOS>
some
instinct
,
deep
in
my
heart
,
which
I
feel
to
be
a
true
one
,
make
the
prospect
of
again
enter
her
presence
repulsive
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
turn
away
from
the
square
,
and
go
straight
back
to
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
some
hour
later
,
while
I
be
rest
in
the
coffee
-
room
,
a
letter
be
place
in
my
hand
by
the
waiter
.
<EOS>
It
be
address
to
me
by
name
,
and
I
find
on
inquiry
that
it
have
be
leave
at
the
bar
by
a
woman
just
as
it
be
near
dusk
,
and
just
before
the
gas
be
light
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
nothing
,
and
she
have
go
away
again
before
there
be
time
to
speak
to
her
,
or
even
to
notice
who
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
open
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
be
neither
date
nor
sign
,
and
the
handwriting
be
palpably
disguise
.
<EOS>
before
I
have
read
the
first
sentence
,
however
,
I
know
who
my
correspondent
be
 
Mrs.
Catherick
.
  
<EOS>
the
letter
run
as
follow
 
<EOS>
I
copy
it
exactly

word

CATHERICK
  
<EOS>
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
come
back
,
as
you
say
you
would
.
<EOS>
no
matter
 
I
know
the
news
,
and
I
write
to
tell
you
so
.
<EOS>
do
you
see
anything
particular
in
my
face
when
you
leave
me
?
<EOS>
I
be
wonder
,
in
my
own
mind
,
whether
the
day
of
his
downfall
have
come
at
last
,
and
whether
you
be
the
choose
instrument
for
work
it
.
<EOS>
You
be
,
and
you
have
work
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
weak
enough
,
as
I
have
hear
,
to
try
and
save
his
life
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
succeed
,
I
should
have
look
upon
you
as
my
enemy
.
<EOS>
now
you
have
fail
,
I
hold
you
as
my
friend
.
<EOS>
Your
inquiry
frighten
him
into
the
vestry
by
night
 
your
inquiry
,
without
your
privity
and
against
your
will
,
have
serve
the
hatred
and
wreak
the
vengeance
of
three
-
and
-
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
thank
you
,
sir
,
in
spite
of
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
I
owe
something
to
the
man
who
have
do
this
.
<EOS>
how
can
I
pay
my
debt
?
<EOS>
if
I
be
a
young
woman
still
I
may
say
,
"
come
,
put
your
arm
round
my
waist
,
and
kiss
me
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
be
fond
enough
of
you
even
to
go
that
length
,
and
you
would
have
accept
my
invitation
 
<EOS>
you
would
,
sir
,
twenty
year
ago
!
<EOS>
but
I
be
an
old
woman
now
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
can
satisfy
your
curiosity
,
and
pay
my
debt
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
great
curiosity
to
know
certain
private
affair
of
mine
when
you
come
to
see
me
 
private
affair
which
all
your
sharpness
could
not
look
into
without
my
help
 
private
affair
which
you
have
not
discover
,
even
now
.
<EOS>
You
SHALL
discover
them
 
your
curiosity
shall
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
any
trouble
to
please
you
,
my
estimable
young
friend
!
  
<EOS>
You
be
a
little
boy
,
I
suppose
,
in
the
year
twenty
-
seven
?
<EOS>
I
be
a
handsome
young
woman
at
that
time
,
live
at
Old
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
contemptible
fool
for
a
husband
.
<EOS>
I
have
also
the
honour
of
be
acquaint
(
never
mind
how
)
with
a
certain
gentleman
(
never
mind
whom
)
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
call
him
by
his
name
.
<EOS>
why
should
I
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
never
have
a
name
:
you
know
<EOS>
that
,
by
this
time
,
as
well
as
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
more
to
the
purpose
to
tell
you
how
he
work
himself
into
my
good
grace
.
<EOS>
I
be
bear
with
the
taste
of
a
lady
,
and
he
gratify
them
 
in
other
word
,
he
admire
me
,
and
he
make
me
present
.
<EOS>
no
woman
can
resist
admiration
and
present
 
especially
present
,
provide
they
happen
to
be
just
the
thing
she
want
.
<EOS>
He
be
sharp
enough
to
know
that
 
most
man
be
.
<EOS>
naturally
he
want
something
in
return
 
all
man
do
.
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
think
be
the
something
?
<EOS>
the
mere
trifle
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
key
of
the
vestry
,
and
the
key
of
the
press
inside
it
,
when
my
husband
's
back
be
turn
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
lie
when
I
ask
him
why
he
wish
me
to
get
him
the
key
in
that
private
way
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
save
himself
the
trouble
 
I
do
not
believe
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
like
my
present
,
and
I
want
more
.
<EOS>
so
I
get
him
the
key
,
without
my
husband
's
knowledge
,
and
I
watch
him
,
without
his
own
knowledge
.
<EOS>
once
,
twice
,
four
time
I
watch
him
,
and
the
fourth
time
I
find
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
never
over
-
scrupulous
where
other
people
's
affair
be
concern
,
and
I
be
not
over
-
scrupulous
about
his
add
one
to
the
marriage
in
the
register
on
his
own
account
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
I
know
it
be
wrong
,
but
it
do
no
harm
to
me
,
which
be
one
good
reason
for
not
make
a
fuss
about
it
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
not
get
a
gold
watch
and
chain
,
which
be
another
,
<EOS>
still
well
 
<EOS>
and
he
have
promise
me
one
from
London
<EOS>
only
the
day
before
,
which
be
a
third
,
good
of
all
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
know
what
the
law
consider
the
crime
to
be
,
and
how
the
law
punish
it
,
I
should
have
take
proper
care
of
myself
,
and
have
expose
him
then
and
there
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
nothing
,
and
I
long
for
the
gold
watch
.
<EOS>
all
the
condition
I
insist
on
be
that
he
should
take
me
into
his
confidence
and
tell
me
everything
.
<EOS>
I
be
as
curious
about
his
affair
then
as
you
be
about
mine
now
.
<EOS>
He
grant
my
condition
 
why
,
you
will
see
presently
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
put
in
short
,
be
what
I
hear
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
willingly
tell
me
all
that
I
tell
you
here
.
<EOS>
I
draw
some
of
it
from
him
by
persuasion
and
some
of
it
by
question
.
<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
have
all
the
truth
,
and
I
believe
I
get
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
know
no
more
than
any
one
else
of
what
the
state
of
thing
really
be
between
his
father
and
mother
till
after
his
mother
's
death
.
<EOS>
then
his
father
confess
it
,
and
promise
to
do
what
he
could
for
his
son
.
<EOS>
He
die
have
do
nothing
 
not
have
even
make
a
will
.
<EOS>
the
son
(
who
can
blame
him
?
)
<EOS>
wisely
provide
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
England
at
once
,
and
take
possession
of
the
property
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
to
suspect
him
,
and
no
one
to
say
him
nay
.
<EOS>
His
father
and
mother
have
always
live
as
man
and
wife
 
none
of
the
few
people
who
be
acquaint
with
them
ever
suppose
them
to
be
anything
else
.
<EOS>
the
right
person
to
claim
the
property
(
if
the
truth
have
be
know
)
be
a
distant
relation
,
who
have
no
idea
of
ever
get
it
,
and
who
be
away
at
sea
when
his
father
die
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
difficulty
so
far
 
he
take
possession
,
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
borrow
money
on
the
property
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
thing
want
of
him
before
he
could
do
this
.
<EOS>
one
be
a
certificate
of
his
birth
,
and
the
other
be
a
certificate
of
his
parent
'
marriage
.
<EOS>
the
certificate
of
his
birth
be
easily
get
 
he
be
bear
abroad
,
and
the
certificate
be
there
in
due
form
.
<EOS>
the
other
matter
be
a
difficulty
,
and
that
difficulty
bring
him
to
Old
Welmingham
.
  
<EOS>
but
for
one
consideration
he
may
have
go
to
Knowlesbury
instead
.
  
<EOS>
His
mother
have
be
live
there
just
before
she
meet
with
his
father
 
live
under
her
maiden
name
,
the
truth
be
that
she
be
really
a
married
woman
,
marry
in
Ireland
,
<EOS>
where
her
husband
have
ill
-
use
her
,
and
have
afterwards
go
off
with
some
other
person
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
this
fact
on
good
authority
 
<EOS>
Sir
Felix
mention
it
to
his
son
as
the
reason
why
he
have
not
marry
.
<EOS>
You
may
wonder
why
the
son
,
know
that
his
parent
have
meet
each
other
at
Knowlesbury
,
do
not
play
his
first
trick
with
the
register
of
that
church
,
where
it
may
have
be
fairly
presume
his
father
and
mother
be
marry
.
<EOS>
the
reason
be
that
the
clergyman
who
do
duty
at
Knowlesbury
church
,
in
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
three
(
when
,
accord
to
his
birth
certificate
,
his
father
and
mother
OUGHT
to
have
be
marry
)
,
be
alive
still
when
he
take
possession
of
the
property
in
the
New
Year
of
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
seven
.
<EOS>
this
awkward
circumstance
force
him
to
extend
his
inquiry
to
our
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
there
no
such
danger
exist
,
the
former
clergyman
at
our
church
have
be
dead
for
some
year
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Welmingham
suit
his
purpose
as
well
as
Knowlesbury
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
remove
his
mother
from
Knowlesbury
,
and
have
live
with
her
at
a
cottage
on
the
river
,
a
little
distance
from
our
village
.
<EOS>
People
who
have
know
his
solitary
way
when
he
be
single
do
not
wonder
at
his
solitary
way
when
he
be
suppose
to
be
marry
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
not
be
a
hideous
creature
to
look
at
,
his
retire
life
with
the
lady
may
have
raise
suspicion
;
but
,
as
thing
be
,
his
hide
his
ugliness
and
his
deformity
in
the
strict
privacy
surprise
nobody
.
<EOS>
He
live
in
our
neighbourhood
till
he
come
in
possession
of
the
Park
.
<EOS>
after
three
or
four
and
twenty
year
have
pass
,
who
be
to
say
(
the
clergyman
be
dead
)
that
his
marriage
have
not
be
as
private
as
the
rest
of
his
life
,
and
that
it
have
not
take
place
at
Old
Welmingham
church
?
  
<EOS>
so
,
as
I
tell
you
,
the
son
find
our
neighbourhood
the
sure
place
he
could
choose
to
set
thing
right
secretly
in
his
own
interest
.
<EOS>
It
may
surprise
you
to
hear
that
what
he
really
do
to
the
marriage
register
be
do
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
 
do
on
second
thought
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
notion
be
only
to
tear
the
leaf
out
(
in
the
right
year
and
month
)
,
to
destroy
it
privately
,
to
go
back
to
London
,
and
to
tell
the
lawyer
to
get
him
the
necessary
certificate
of
his
father
's
marriage
,
innocently
refer
them
of
course
to
the
date
on
the
leaf
that
be
go
.
<EOS>
nobody
could
say
his
father
and
mother
have
not
be
marry
after
that
,
and
whether
,
under
the
circumstance
,
they
would
stretch
a
point
or
not
about
lend
him
the
money
<EOS>
(
he
think
they
would
)
,
he
have
his
answer
ready
at
all
event
,
if
a
question
be
ever
raise
about
his
right
to
the
name
and
the
estate
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
he
come
to
look
privately
at
the
register
for
himself
,
he
find
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
page
for
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
three
a
blank
space
leave
,
seemingly
through
there
be
no
room
to
make
a
long
entry
there
,
which
be
make
instead
at
the
top
of
the
next
page
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
this
chance
alter
all
his
plan
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
opportunity
he
have
never
hope
for
,
or
thought
of
 
<EOS>
and
he
take
it
 
<EOS>
you
know
how
.
<EOS>
the
blank
space
,
to
have
exactly
tally
with
his
birth
certificate
,
ought
to
have
occur
in
the
July
part
of
the
register
.
<EOS>
It
occur
in
the
September
part
instead
.
<EOS>
however
,
in
this
case
,
if
suspicious
question
be
ask
,
the
answer
be
not
hard
to
find
.
<EOS>
He
have
only
to
describe
himself
as
a
seven
month
'
child
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
fool
enough
,
when
he
tell
me
his
story
,
to
feel
some
interest
and
some
pity
for
him
 
which
be
just
what
he
calculate
on
,
as
you
will
see
.
<EOS>
I
think
him
hardly
use
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
his
fault
that
his
father
and
mother
be
not
married
,
and
it
be
not
his
father
's
and
mother
's
fault
either
.
<EOS>
a
more
scrupulous
woman
than
I
be
 
a
woman
who
have
not
set
her
heart
on
a
gold
watch
and
chain
 
would
have
find
some
excuse
for
him
.
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
I
hold
my
tongue
,
and
help
to
screen
what
he
be
about
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
some
time
get
the
ink
the
right
colour
<EOS>
(
mix
it
over
and
over
again
in
pot
and
bottle
of
mine
)
,
and
some
time
afterwards
in
practise
the
handwriting
.
<EOS>
but
he
succeed
in
the
end
,
and
make
an
honest
woman
of
his
mother
after
she
be
dead
in
her
grave
!
<EOS>
so
far
,
I
do
not
deny
that
he
behave
honourably
enough
to
myself
.
<EOS>
He
give
me
my
watch
and
chain
,
and
spare
no
expense
in
buy
them
;
both
be
of
superior
workmanship
,
and
very
expensive
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
them
still
 
<EOS>
the
watch
go
beautifully
.
  
<EOS>
You
say
the
other
day
that
Mrs.
Clements
have
tell
you
everything
she
know
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
there
be
no
need
for
me
to
write
about
the
trumpery
scandal
by
which
I
be
the
sufferer
 
<EOS>
the
innocent
sufferer
,
I
positively
assert
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
as
well
as
I
do
what
the
notion
be
which
my
husband
take
into
his
head
when
he
find
me
and
my
fine
-
gentleman
acquaintance
meet
each
other
privately
and
talk
secret
together
.
<EOS>
but
what
you
do
not
know
be
how
it
end
between
that
same
gentleman
and
myself
.
<EOS>
You
shall
read
and
see
how
he
behave
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
word
I
say
to
him
,
when
I
see
the
turn
thing
have
take
,
be
,
"
do
me
justice
 
<EOS>
clear
my
character
of
a
stain
on
it
which
you
know
I
do
not
deserve
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
you
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
my
husband
 
<EOS>
only
tell
him
,
on
your
word
of
honour
as
a
gentleman
,
that
he
be
wrong
,
and
that
I
be
not
to
blame
in
the
way
he
think
I
be
.
<EOS>
do
me
that
justice
,
at
least
,
after
all
I
have
do
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
flatly
refuse
,
in
so
many
word
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
plainly
that
it
be
his
interest
to
let
my
husband
and
all
my
neighbour
believe
the
falsehood
 
because
,
as
long
as
they
do
so
they
be
quite
certain
never
to
suspect
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
spirit
of
my
own
,
and
I
tell
him
they
should
know
the
truth
from
my
lip
.
<EOS>
His
reply
be
short
,
and
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
if
I
speak
,
I
be
a
lose
woman
,
as
certainly
as
he
be
a
lost
man
.
  
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
it
have
come
to
that
.
<EOS>
He
have
deceive
me
about
the
risk
I
run
in
help
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
practise
on
my
ignorance
,
he
have
tempt
me
with
his
gift
,
he
have
interest
me
with
his
story
 
and
the
result
of
it
<EOS>
be
that
he
make
me
his
accomplice
.
<EOS>
He
own
this
coolly
,
and
he
end
by
tell
me
,
for
the
first
time
,
what
the
frightful
punishment
really
be
for
his
offence
,
and
for
any
one
who
help
him
to
commit
it
.
<EOS>
in
those
day
the
law
be
not
so
tender
-
hearted
as
I
hear
it
be
now
.
<EOS>
murderer
be
not
the
only
people
liable
to
be
hang
,
and
woman
convict
be
not
treat
like
lady
in
undeserved
distress
.
<EOS>
I
confess
he
frighten
me
 
the
mean
impostor
!
<EOS>
the
cowardly
blackguard
!
<EOS>
do
you
understand
now
how
I
hate
him
?
<EOS>
do
you
understand
why
I
be
take
all
this
trouble
 
thankfully
take
it
 
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
the
meritorious
young
gentleman
who
hunt
him
down
?
  
<EOS>
well
,
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
He
be
hardly
fool
enough
to
drive
me
to
downright
desperation
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
the
sort
of
woman
whom
it
be
quite
safe
to
hunt
into
a
corner
 
he
know
that
,
and
wisely
quiet
me
with
proposal
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
I
deserve
some
reward
<EOS>
(
he
be
kind
enough
to
say
)
for
the
service
I
have
do
him
,
and
some
compensation
(
he
be
so
obliging
as
to
add
)
<EOS>
for
what
I
have
suffer
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
willing
 
generous
scoundrel
!
 
<EOS>
to
make
me
a
handsome
yearly
allowance
,
payable
quarterly
,
on
two
condition
.
<EOS>
first
,
I
be
to
hold
my
tongue
 
in
my
own
interest
as
well
as
in
his
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
I
be
not
to
stir
away
from
Welmingham
without
first
let
him
know
,
and
wait
till
I
have
obtain
his
permission
.
<EOS>
in
my
own
neighbourhood
,
no
virtuous
female
friend
would
tempt
me
into
dangerous
gossiping
at
the
tea
-
table
.
<EOS>
in
my
own
neighbourhood
,
he
would
always
know
where
to
find
me
.
<EOS>
a
hard
condition
,
that
second
one
 
<EOS>
but
I
accept
it
.
  
<EOS>
what
else
be
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
be
leave
helpless
,
with
the
prospect
of
a
coming
incumbrance
in
the
shape
of
a
child
.
<EOS>
what
else
be
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
cast
myself
on
the
mercy
of
my
runaway
idiot
of
a
husband
who
have
raise
the
scandal
against
me
?
<EOS>
I
would
have
die
first
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
allowance
be
a
handsome
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
well
income
,
a
well
house
over
my
head
,
well
carpet
on
my
floor
,
than
half
the
woman
who
turn
up
the
white
of
their
eye
at
the
sight
of
me
.
<EOS>
the
dress
of
Virtue
,
in
our
part
,
be
cotton
print
.
<EOS>
I
have
silk
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
accept
the
condition
he
offer
me
,
and
make
the
good
of
them
,
and
fight
my
battle
with
my
respectable
neighbour
on
their
own
ground
,
and
win
it
in
course
of
time
 
as
you
see
yourself
.
<EOS>
how
I
keep
his
secret
(
and
mine
)
through
all
the
year
that
have
pass
from
that
time
to
this
,
and
whether
my
late
daughter
,
Anne
,
ever
really
creep
into
my
confidence
,
and
get
the
keeping
of
the
Secret
too
 
be
question
,
I
dare
say
,
to
which
you
be
curious
to
find
an
answer
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
my
gratitude
refuse
you
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
will
turn
to
a
fresh
page
and
give
you
the
answer
immediately
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
excuse
one
thing
 
<EOS>
you
must
excuse
my
beginning
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
with
an
expression
of
surprise
at
the
interest
which
you
appear
to
have
feel
in
my
late
daughter
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
unaccountable
to
me
.
<EOS>
if
that
interest
make
you
anxious
for
any
particular
of
her
early
life
,
I
must
refer
you
to
Mrs.
Clements
,
who
know
more
of
the
subject
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
pray
understand
that
I
do
not
profess
to
have
be
at
all
overfond
of
my
late
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
worry
to
me
from
first
to
last
,
with
the
additional
disadvantage
of
be
always
weak
in
the
head
.
<EOS>
You
like
candour
,
and
I
hope
this
satisfie
you
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
to
trouble
you
with
many
personal
particular
relate
to
those
past
time
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
enough
to
say
that
I
observe
the
term
of
the
bargain
on
my
side
,
and
that
I
enjoy
my
comfortable
income
in
return
,
pay
quarterly
.
  
<EOS>
now
<EOS>
and
then
I
get
away
and
change
the
scene
for
a
short
time
,
always
ask
leave
of
my
lord
and
master
first
,
and
generally
get
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
,
as
I
have
already
tell
you
,
fool
enough
to
drive
me
too
hard
,
and
he
could
reasonably
rely
on
my
hold
my
tongue
for
my
own
sake
,
if
not
for
his
.
<EOS>
one
of
my
long
trip
away
from
home
be
the
trip
I
take
to
Limmeridge
to
nurse
a
half
-
sister
there
,
who
be
die
.
<EOS>
She
be
report
to
have
save
money
,
and
I
think
it
as
well
(
in
case
any
accident
happen
to
stop
my
allowance
)
to
look
after
my
own
interest
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
as
thing
turn
out
,
however
,
my
pain
be
all
throw
away
,
and
I
get
nothing
,
because
nothing
be
to
be
have
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
take
Anne
to
the
north
with
me
,
have
my
whim
and
fancy
,
occasionally
,
about
my
child
,
and
get
,
at
such
time
,
jealous
of
Mrs.
Clements
'
influence
over
her
.
<EOS>
I
never
like
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
poor
,
empty
-
headed
,
spiritless
woman
 
what
you
call
a
bear
drudge
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
now
and
then
not
averse
to
plague
her
by
take
Anne
away
.
<EOS>
not
know
what
else
to
do
with
my
girl
while
I
be
nurse
in
Cumberland
,
I
put
her
to
school
at
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
the
lady
of
the
manor
,
Mrs.
Fairlie
(
a
remarkably
plain
-
look
woman
,
who
have
entrap
one
of
the
handsome
man
in
England
into
marry
her
)
,
amuse
me
wonderfully
by
take
a
violent
fancy
to
my
girl
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
she
learn
nothing
at
school
,
and
be
pet
and
spoilt
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
among
other
whim
and
fancy
which
they
teach
her
there
,
they
put
some
nonsense
into
her
head
about
always
wear
white
.
<EOS>
hate
white
and
like
colour
myself
,
I
determine
to
take
the
nonsense
out
of
her
head
as
soon
as
we
get
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
strange
to
say
,
my
daughter
resolutely
resist
me
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
get
a
notion
once
fix
in
her
mind
<EOS>
she
be
,
like
other
half
-
witted
people
,
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
in
keep
it
.
<EOS>
We
quarrel
finely
,
and
Mrs.
Clements
,
not
like
to
see
it
,
I
suppose
,
offer
to
take
Anne
away
to
live
in
London
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
say
<EOS>
yes
,
if
Mrs.
Clements
have
not
side
with
my
daughter
about
her
dress
herself
in
white
.
<EOS>
but
be
determine
she
should
not
dress
herself
in
white
,
and
disliking
Mrs.
Clements
more
than
ever
for
take
part
against
me
,
I
say
no
,
and
mean
no
,
and
stick
to
no
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
my
daughter
remain
with
me
,
and
the
consequence
of
that
,
in
its
turn
,
be
the
first
serious
quarrel
that
happen
about
the
Secret
.
  
<EOS>
the
circumstance
take
place
long
after
the
time
I
have
just
be
write
of
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
settle
for
year
in
the
new
town
,
and
be
steadily
live
down
my
bad
character
and
slowly
gain
ground
among
the
respectable
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
It
help
me
forward
greatly
towards
this
object
to
have
my
daughter
with
me
.
<EOS>
Her
harmlessness
and
her
fancy
for
dress
in
white
excite
a
certain
amount
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
I
leave
off
oppose
her
favourite
whim
on
that
account
,
because
some
of
the
sympathy
be
sure
,
in
course
of
time
,
to
fall
to
my
share
.
<EOS>
some
of
it
do
fall
.
<EOS>
I
date
my
get
a
choice
of
the
two
good
sitting
to
let
in
the
church
from
that
time
,
and
I
date
the
clergyman
's
first
bow
from
my
get
the
sitting
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
be
settle
in
this
way
,
I
receive
a
letter
one
morning
from
that
highly
bear
gentleman
(
now
deceased
)
in
answer
to
one
of
mine
,
warn
him
,
accord
to
agreement
,
of
my
wishing
to
leave
the
town
for
a
little
change
of
air
and
scene
.
  
<EOS>
the
ruffianly
side
of
him
must
have
be
uppermost
,
I
suppose
,
when
he
get
my
letter
,
for
he
write
back
,
refuse
me
in
such
abominably
insolent
language
,
that
I
lose
all
command
over
myself
,
and
abuse
him
,
in
my
daughter
's
presence
,
as
"
a
low
impostor
whom
I
could
ruin
for
life
if
I
choose
to
open
my
lip
and
let
out
his
Secret
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
no
more
about
him
than
that
,
be
bring
to
my
sense
as
soon
as
those
word
have
escape
me
by
the
sight
of
my
daughter
's
face
look
eagerly
and
curiously
at
mine
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
order
her
out
of
the
room
until
I
have
compose
myself
again
.
  
<EOS>
My
sensation
be
not
pleasant
,
I
can
tell
you
,
when
I
come
to
reflect
on
my
own
folly
.
<EOS>
Anne
have
be
more
than
usually
crazy
and
queer
that
year
,
and
when
I
think
of
the
chance
there
may
be
of
her
repeat
my
word
in
the
town
,
and
mention
his
name
in
connection
with
them
,
if
inquisitive
people
get
hold
of
her
,
I
be
finely
terrified
at
the
possible
consequence
.
<EOS>
My
bad
fear
for
myself
,
my
bad
dread
of
what
he
may
do
,
lead
me
no
farther
than
this
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
unprepared
for
what
really
do
happen
only
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
next
day
,
without
any
warning
to
me
to
expect
him
,
he
come
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
word
,
and
the
tone
in
which
he
speak
them
,
surly
as
it
be
,
show
me
plainly
enough
that
he
have
repent
already
of
his
insolent
answer
to
my
application
,
and
that
he
have
come
in
a
mighty
bad
temper
to
try
and
set
matter
right
again
before
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
see
my
daughter
in
the
room
with
me
(
I
have
be
afraid
to
let
her
out
of
my
sight
after
what
have
happen
the
day
before
)
<EOS>
he
order
her
away
.
<EOS>
They
neither
of
them
like
each
other
,
and
he
vent
the
ill
-
temper
on
HER
which
he
be
afraid
to
show
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
leave
us
,
"
he
say
,
look
at
her
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
She
look
back
over
her
shoulder
and
wait
as
if
she
do
not
care
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
hear
?
"
<EOS>
he
roar
out
,
"
leave
the
room
.
"
<EOS>
"
speak
to
me
civilly
,
"
say
she
,
get
red
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
turn
the
idiot
out
,
"
say
he
,
look
my
way
.
<EOS>
She
have
always
have
crazy
notion
of
her
own
about
her
dignity
,
and
that
word
"
idiot
"
upset
her
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
before
I
could
interfere
she
step
up
to
him
in
a
fine
passion
.
<EOS>
"
beg
my
pardon
,
directly
,
"
say
she
,
"
or
I
will
make
it
the
bad
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
let
out
your
secret
.
<EOS>
I
can
ruin
you
for
life
if
I
choose
to
open
my
lip
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
own
word
!
 
<EOS>
repeat
exactly
from
what
I
have
say
the
day
before
 
repeat
,
in
his
presence
,
as
if
they
have
come
from
herself
.
<EOS>
He
sit
speechless
,
as
white
as
the
paper
I
be
write
on
,
while
I
push
her
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
when
he
recover
himself
    
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
I
be
too
respectable
a
woman
to
mention
what
he
say
when
he
recover
himself
.
<EOS>
My
pen
be
the
pen
of
a
member
of
the
rector
's
congregation
,
and
a
subscriber
to
the
"
Wednesday
Lectures
on
Justification
by
Faith
"
 
<EOS>
how
can
you
expect
me
to
employ
it
in
write
bad
language
?
<EOS>
suppose
,
for
yourself
,
the
raging
,
swear
frenzy
of
the
low
ruffian
in
England
,
and
let
us
get
on
together
,
as
fast
as
may
be
,
to
the
way
in
which
it
all
end
.
  
<EOS>
It
end
,
as
you
probably
guess
by
this
time
,
in
his
insisting
on
secure
his
own
safety
by
shut
her
up
.
  
<EOS>
I
try
to
set
thing
right
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
she
have
merely
repeat
,
like
a
parrot
,
the
word
she
have
hear
me
say
and
that
she
know
no
particular
whatever
,
because
I
have
mention
none
.
<EOS>
I
explain
that
she
have
affect
,
out
of
crazy
spite
against
him
,
to
know
what
she
really
do
not
know
 
that
she
only
want
to
threaten
him
and
aggravate
him
for
speak
to
her
as
he
have
just
speak
 
and
that
my
unlucky
word
give
her
just
the
chance
of
do
mischief
of
which
she
be
in
search
.
<EOS>
I
refer
him
to
other
queer
way
of
her
,
and
to
his
own
experience
of
the
vagary
of
half
-
witted
people
 
<EOS>
it
be
all
to
no
purpose
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
believe
me
on
my
oath
 
<EOS>
he
be
absolutely
certain
I
have
betray
the
whole
secret
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
would
hear
of
nothing
but
shut
her
up
.
  
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
I
do
my
duty
as
a
mother
.
"
<EOS>
no
pauper
Asylum
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
will
not
have
her
put
in
a
pauper
Asylum
.
<EOS>
a
private
Establishment
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
feeling
as
a
mother
,
and
my
character
to
preserve
in
the
town
,
and
I
will
submit
to
nothing
but
a
private
Establishment
,
of
the
sort
which
my
genteel
neighbour
would
choose
for
afflict
relative
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
"
those
be
my
word
.
<EOS>
It
be
gratify
to
me
to
reflect
that
I
do
my
duty
.
<EOS>
though
never
overfond
of
my
late
daughter
,
I
have
a
proper
pride
about
her
.
<EOS>
no
pauper
stain
 
<EOS>
thank
to
my
firmness
and
resolution
 
ever
rest
on
my
child
.
  
<EOS>
have
carry
my
point
(
which
I
do
the
more
easily
,
in
consequence
of
the
facility
offer
by
private
asylum
)
,
I
could
not
refuse
to
admit
that
there
be
certain
advantage
gain
by
shut
her
up
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
she
be
take
excellent
care
of
 
be
treat
(
as
I
take
care
to
mention
in
the
town
)
on
the
footing
of
a
lady
.
<EOS>
in
the
second
place
,
she
be
keep
away
from
Welmingham
,
where
she
may
have
set
people
suspect
and
inquire
,
by
repeat
my
own
incautious
word
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
drawback
of
put
her
under
restraint
be
a
very
slight
one
.
<EOS>
We
merely
turn
her
empty
boast
about
know
the
Secret
into
a
fix
delusion
.
<EOS>
have
first
speak
in
sheer
crazy
spitefulness
against
the
man
who
have
offend
her
,
she
be
cunne
enough
to
see
that
she
have
seriously
frighten
him
,
and
sharp
enough
afterwards
to
discover
that
he
be
concerned
in
shut
her
up
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
she
flame
out
into
a
perfect
frenzy
of
passion
against
him
,
go
to
the
Asylum
,
and
the
first
word
she
say
to
the
nurse
,
after
they
have
quiet
her
,
be
,
that
she
be
put
in
confinement
for
know
his
Secret
,
and
that
she
mean
to
open
her
lip
and
ruin
him
,
when
the
right
time
come
.
  
<EOS>
She
may
have
say
the
same
thing
to
you
,
when
you
thoughtlessly
assist
her
escape
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
say
it
(
as
I
hear
last
summer
)
to
the
unfortunate
woman
who
marry
our
sweet
-
tempered
,
nameless
gentleman
lately
decease
.
<EOS>
if
either
you
,
or
that
unlucky
lady
,
have
question
my
daughter
closely
,
and
have
insist
on
her
explain
what
she
really
mean
,
you
would
have
find
her
lose
all
her
self
-
importance
suddenly
,
and
get
vacant
,
and
restless
,
and
confused
 
you
would
have
discover
that
I
be
write
nothing
here
but
the
plain
truth
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
there
be
a
Secret
 
<EOS>
she
know
who
be
connect
with
it
 
<EOS>
she
know
who
would
suffer
by
its
be
know
 
and
beyond
that
<EOS>
,
whatever
air
of
importance
she
may
have
give
herself
,
<EOS>
whatever
crazy
boasting
she
may
have
indulge
in
with
stranger
,
she
never
to
her
die
day
know
more
.
  
<EOS>
have
I
satisfy
your
curiosity
?
<EOS>
I
have
take
pain
enough
to
satisfy
it
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
there
be
really
nothing
else
I
have
to
tell
you
about
myself
or
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
My
bad
responsibility
,
so
far
as
she
be
concern
,
be
all
over
when
she
be
secure
in
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
form
of
letter
relate
to
the
circumstance
under
which
she
be
shut
up
,
give
me
to
write
,
in
answer
to
one
Miss
Halcombe
,
who
be
curious
in
the
matter
,
and
who
must
have
hear
plenty
of
lie
about
me
from
a
certain
tongue
well
accustomed
to
the
telling
of
the
same
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
what
I
could
afterwards
to
trace
my
runaway
daughter
,
and
prevent
her
from
do
mischief
by
make
inquiry
myself
in
the
neighbourhood
where
she
be
falsely
report
to
have
be
see
.
<EOS>
but
these
,
and
other
trifle
like
them
,
be
of
little
or
no
interest
to
you
after
what
you
have
hear
already
.
  
<EOS>
so
far
,
I
have
write
in
the
friendly
possible
spirit
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
close
this
letter
without
add
a
word
here
of
serious
remonstrance
and
reproof
,
address
to
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
your
personal
interview
with
me
,
you
audaciously
refer
to
my
late
daughter
's
parentage
on
the
father
's
side
,
as
if
that
parentage
be
a
matter
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
this
be
highly
improper
and
very
ungentlemanlike
on
your
part
!
<EOS>
if
we
see
each
other
again
,
remember
,
if
you
please
,
that
I
will
allow
no
liberty
to
be
take
with
my
reputation
,
and
that
the
moral
atmosphere
of
Welmingham
(
to
use
a
favourite
expression
of
my
friend
the
rector
's
)
must
not
be
taint
by
loose
conversation
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
if
you
allow
yourself
to
doubt
that
my
husband
be
Anne
's
father
,
you
personally
insult
me
in
the
gross
manner
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
feel
,
and
if
you
still
continue
to
feel
,
an
unhallowed
curiosity
on
this
subject
,
I
recommend
you
,
in
your
own
interest
,
to
check
it
at
once
,
and
for
ever
.
<EOS>
on
this
side
of
the
grave
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
whatever
may
happen
on
the
other
,
that
curiosity
will
never
be
gratify
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
,
after
what
I
have
just
say
,
you
will
see
the
necessity
of
write
me
an
apology
.
<EOS>
do
so
,
and
I
will
willingly
receive
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
afterwards
,
if
your
wish
point
to
a
second
interview
with
me
,
go
a
step
farther
,
and
receive
you
.
<EOS>
My
circumstance
only
enable
me
to
invite
you
to
tea
 
not
that
they
be
at
all
alter
for
the
bad
by
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
live
,
as
I
think
I
tell
you
,
well
within
my
income
,
and
I
have
save
enough
,
in
the
last
twenty
year
,
to
make
me
quite
comfortable
for
the
rest
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
intention
to
leave
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
or
two
little
advantage
which
I
have
still
to
gain
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
the
clergyman
bow
to
me
 
as
you
see
.
<EOS>
He
be
married
,
and
his
wife
be
not
quite
so
civil
.
<EOS>
I
propose
to
join
the
Dorcas
Society
,
and
I
mean
to
make
the
clergyman
's
wife
bow
to
me
next
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
favour
me
with
your
company
,
pray
understand
that
the
conversation
must
be
entirely
on
general
subject
.
<EOS>
any
attempt
reference
to
this
letter
will
be
quite
useless
 
<EOS>
I
be
determine
not
to
acknowledge
have
write
it
.
<EOS>
the
evidence
have
be
destroy
in
the
fire
,
I
know
,
but
I
think
it
desirable
to
err
on
the
side
of
caution
,
nevertheless
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
account
no
name
be
mention
here
,
nor
be
any
signature
attach
to
these
line
:
the
handwriting
be
disguise
throughout
,
and
I
mean
to
deliver
the
letter
myself
,
under
circumstance
which
will
prevent
all
fear
of
its
be
trace
to
my
house
.
<EOS>
You
can
have
no
possible
cause
to
complain
of
these
precaution
,
see
that
they
do
not
affect
the
information
I
here
communicate
,
in
consideration
of
the
special
indulgence
which
you
have
deserve
at
my
hand
.
<EOS>
My
hour
for
tea
be
half
-
past
five
,
and
my
buttered
toast
wait
for
nobody
.
  
<EOS>
the
STORY
CONTINUED
by
WALTER
HARTRIGHT
      
<EOS>
My
first
impulse
,
after
read
Mrs.
Catherick
's
extraordinary
narrative
,
be
to
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
the
harden
shameless
depravity
of
the
whole
composition
,
from
begin
to
end
 
the
atrocious
perversity
of
mind
which
persistently
associate
me
with
a
calamity
for
which
I
be
in
no
sense
answerable
,
and
with
a
death
which
I
have
risk
my
life
in
try
to
avert
 
<EOS>
so
disgust
me
,
that
I
be
on
the
point
of
tear
the
letter
,
when
a
consideration
suggest
itself
which
warn
me
to
wait
a
little
before
I
destroy
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
consideration
be
entirely
unconnected
with
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
the
information
communicate
to
me
,
so
far
as
it
concern
him
,
do
little
more
than
confirm
the
conclusion
at
which
I
have
already
arrive
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
commit
his
offence
,
as
I
have
suppose
him
to
have
commit
it
,
and
the
absence
of
all
reference
,
on
Mrs.
Catherick
's
part
,
to
the
duplicate
register
at
Knowlesbury
,
strengthen
my
previous
conviction
that
the
existence
of
the
book
,
and
the
risk
of
detection
which
it
imply
,
must
have
be
necessarily
unknown
to
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
My
interest
in
the
question
of
the
forgery
be
now
at
an
end
,
and
my
only
object
in
keep
the
letter
be
to
make
it
of
some
future
service
in
clear
up
the
last
mystery
that
still
remain
to
baffle
me
 
<EOS>
the
parentage
of
Anne
Catherick
on
the
father
's
side
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
or
two
sentence
drop
in
her
mother
's
narrative
,
which
it
may
be
useful
to
refer
to
again
,
when
matter
of
more
immediate
importance
allow
me
leisure
to
search
for
the
miss
evidence
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
despair
of
still
find
that
evidence
,
and
I
have
lose
none
of
my
anxiety
to
discover
it
,
for
I
have
lose
none
of
my
interest
in
trace
the
father
of
the
poor
creature
who
now
lie
at
rest
in
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
seal
up
the
letter
and
put
it
away
carefully
in
my
pocket
-
book
,
to
be
refer
to
again
when
the
time
come
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
be
my
last
in
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
appear
again
before
the
magistrate
at
Knowlesbury
,
and
when
I
have
attend
at
the
adjourn
inquest
,
I
should
be
free
to
return
to
London
by
the
afternoon
or
the
evening
train
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
errand
in
the
morning
be
,
as
usual
,
to
the
post
-
office
.
<EOS>
the
letter
from
Marian
be
there
,
but
I
think
when
it
be
hand
to
me
that
it
feel
unusually
light
.
<EOS>
I
anxiously
open
the
envelope
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
inside
but
a
small
strip
of
paper
fold
in
two
.
<EOS>
the
few
blot
hurriedly
-
write
line
which
be
trace
on
it
contain
these
word
:
  
"
come
back
as
soon
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
oblige
to
move
.
<EOS>
come
to
Gower
's
Walk
,
Fulham
(
number
five
)
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
on
the
look
-
out
for
you
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
alarm
about
us
,
we
be
both
safe
and
well
.
<EOS>
but
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
Marian
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
news
which
those
line
contain
 
news
which
I
instantly
associate
with
some
attempt
treachery
on
the
part
of
Count
Fosco
 
fairly
overwhelm
me
.
<EOS>
I
stand
breathless
with
the
paper
crumple
up
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
what
have
happen
?
<EOS>
what
subtle
wickedness
have
the
Count
plan
and
execute
in
my
absence
?
<EOS>
a
night
have
pass
since
Marian
's
note
be
write
 
hour
must
elapse
still
before
I
could
get
back
to
them
 
<EOS>
some
new
disaster
may
have
happen
already
of
which
I
be
ignorant
.
<EOS>
and
here
,
mile
and
mile
away
from
them
,
here
I
must
remain
 
hold
,
doubly
hold
,
at
the
disposal
of
the
law
!
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
to
what
forgetfulness
of
my
obligation
anxiety
and
alarm
may
not
have
tempt
me
,
but
for
the
quieting
influence
of
my
faith
in
Marian
.
<EOS>
My
absolute
reliance
on
her
be
the
one
earthly
consideration
which
help
me
to
restrain
myself
,
and
give
me
courage
to
wait
.
<EOS>
the
inquest
be
the
first
of
the
impediment
in
the
way
of
my
freedom
of
action
.
<EOS>
I
attend
it
at
the
appoint
time
,
the
legal
formality
require
my
presence
in
the
room
,
but
as
it
turn
out
,
not
call
on
me
to
repeat
my
evidence

<EOS>
this
useless

although
I
do
my
good
to

course
of

as
closely
as
I

<EOS>
the
London
solicitor
of
the
deceased

Mr.
Merriman
)
be
among
the
person
present
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
quite
unable
to
assist
the
object
of
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
say
that
he
be
inexpressibly
shock
and
astonish
,
and
that
he
could
throw
no
light
whatever
on
the
mysterious
circumstance
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
at
interval
during
the
adjourn
investigation
,
he
suggest
question
which
the
Coroner
put
,
but
which
lead
to
no
result
.
<EOS>
after
a
patient
inquiry
,
which
last
nearly
three
hour
,
and
which
exhaust
every
available
source
of
information
,
the
jury
pronounce
the
customary
verdict
in
case
of
sudden
death
by
accident
.
<EOS>
They
add
to
the
formal
decision
a
statement
,
that
there
have
be
no
evidence
to
show
how
the
key
have
be
abstract
,
how
the
fire
have
be
cause
,
or
what
the
purpose
be
for
which
the
deceased
have
enter
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
this
act
close
the
proceeding
.
<EOS>
the
legal
representative
of
the
dead
man
be
leave
to
provide
for
the
necessity
of
the
interment
,
and
the
witness
be
free
to
retire
.
  
<EOS>
resolve
not
to
lose
a
minute
in
get
to
Knowlesbury
,
I
pay
my
bill
at
the
hotel
,
and
hire
a
fly
to
take
me
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
who
hear
me
give
the
order
,
and
who
see
that
I
be
go
alone
,
inform
me
that
he
live
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Knowlesbury
,
and
ask
if
I
would
have
any
objection
to
his
get
home
by
share
the
fly
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
accept
his
proposal
as
a
matter
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
Our
conversation
during
the
drive
be
naturally
occupy
by
the
one
absorb
subject
of
local
interest
.
  
<EOS>
My
new
acquaintance
have
some
knowledge
of
the
late
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
,
and
he
and
Mr.
Merriman
have
be
discuss
the
state
of
the
deceased
gentleman
's
affair
and
the
succession
to
the
property
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
embarrassment
be
so
well
know
all
over
the
county
that
his
solicitor
could
only
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
plainly
acknowledge
them
.
<EOS>
He
have
die
without
leave
a
will
,
and
he
have
no
personal
property
to
bequeath
,
even
if
he
have
make
one
,
the
whole
fortune
which
he
have
derive
from
his
wife
have
be
swallow
up
by
his
creditor
.
<EOS>
the
heir
to
the
estate
<EOS>
(
Sir
Percival
have
leave
no
issue
)
be
a
son
of
Sir
Felix
Glyde
's
first
cousin
,
an
officer
in
command
of
an
East
Indiaman
.
<EOS>
He
would
find
his
unexpected
inheritance
sadly
encumber
,
but
the
property
would
recover
with
time
,
and
,
if
"
the
captain
"
be
careful
,
he
may
be
a
rich
man
yet
before
he
die
.
  
<EOS>
absorb
as
I
be
in
the
one
idea
of
get
to
London
,
this
information
(
which
event
prove
to
be
perfectly
correct
)
have
an
interest
of
its
own
to
attract
my
attention
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
justify
me
in
keep
secret
my
discovery
of
Sir
Percival
's
fraud
.
<EOS>
the
heir
,
whose
right
he
have
usurp
,
be
the
heir
who
would
now
have
the
estate
.
<EOS>
the
income
from
it
,
for
the
last
three
-
and
-
twenty
year
,
which
should
properly
have
be
his
,
and
which
the
dead
man
have
squander
to
the
last
farthing
,
be
go
beyond
recall
.
<EOS>
if
I
speak
,
my
speaking
would
confer
advantage
on
no
one
.
<EOS>
if
I
keep
the
secret
,
my
silence
conceal
the
character
of
the
man
who
have
cheat
Laura
into
marry
him
.
<EOS>
for
her
sake
,
I
wish
to
conceal
it
 
for
her
sake
,
still
,
I
tell
this
story
under
feign
name
.
  
<EOS>
I
part
with
my
chance
companion
at
Knowlesbury
,
and
go
at
once
to
the
town
-
hall
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
anticipate
,
no
one
be
present
to
prosecute
the
case
against
me
 
the
necessary
formality
be
observe
,
and
I
be
discharge
.
<EOS>
on
leave
the
court
a
letter
from
Mr.
Dawson
be
put
into
my
hand
.
<EOS>
It
inform
me
that
he
be
absent
on
professional
duty
,
and
it
reiterate
the
offer
I
have
already
receive
from
him
of
any
assistance
which
I
may
require
at
his
hand
.
<EOS>
I
write
back
,
warmly
acknowledge
my
obligation
to
his
kindness
,
and
apologise
for
not
express
my
thank
personally
,
in
consequence
of
my
immediate
recall
on
press
business
to
town
.
  
<EOS>
half
an
hour
later
I
be
speed
back
to
London
by
the
express
train
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
between
nine
and
ten
o'clock
before
I
reach
Fulham
,
and
find
my
way
to
Gower
's
walk
.
  
<EOS>
both
Laura
and
Marian
come
to
the
door
to
let
me
in
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
have
hardly
know
how
close
the
tie
be
which
bind
us
three
together
,
until
the
evening
come
which
unite
us
again
.
<EOS>
We
meet
as
if
we
have
be
part
for
month
instead
of
for
a
few
day
only
.
<EOS>
Marian
's
face
be
sadly
wear
and
anxious
.
<EOS>
I
see
who
have
know
all
the
danger
and
bear
all
the
trouble
in
my
absence
the
moment
I
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
Laura
's
bright
look
and
well
spirit
tell
me
how
carefully
she
have
be
spare
all
knowledge
of
the
dreadful
death
at
Welmingham
,
and
of
the
true
reason
of
our
change
of
abode
.
  
<EOS>
the
stir
of
the
removal
seem
to
have
cheer
and
interest
her
.
<EOS>
She
only
speak
of
it
as
a
happy
thought
of
Marian
's
to
surprise
me
on
my
return
with
a
change
from
the
close
,
noisy
street
to
the
pleasant
neighbourhood
of
tree
and
field
and
the
river
.
<EOS>
She
be
full
of
project
for
the
future
 
of
the
drawing
she
be
to
finish
 
of
the
purchaser
I
have
find
in
the
country
who
be
to
buy
them
 
of
the
shilling
and
sixpence
she
have
save
,
till
her
purse
be
so
heavy
that
she
proudly
ask
me
to
weigh
it
in
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
the
change
for
the
well
which
have
be
work
in
her
during
the
few
day
of
my
absence
be
a
surprise
to
me
for
which
I
be
quite
unprepared
 
and
for
all
the
unspeakable
happiness
of
see
it
,
I
be
indebte
to
Marian
's
courage
and
to
Marian
's
love
.
  
<EOS>
when
Laura
have
leave
us
,
and
when
we
could
speak
to
one
another
without
restraint
,
I
try
to
give
some
expression
to
the
gratitude
and
the
admiration
which
fill
my
heart
.
<EOS>
but
the
generous
creature
would
not
wait
to
hear
me
.
<EOS>
that
sublime
self
-
forgetfulness
of
woman
,
which
yield
so
much
and
ask
so
little
,
turn
all
her
thought
from
herself
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
a
moment
leave
before
post

time
,
"
she
say
,
"
or
I
should
have
write
less
abruptly
.
<EOS>
You

<EOS>
I
be
afraid
my

<EOS>

I
reply

<EOS>
"
My

Marian

by
my
trust
in
you

<EOS>
be

this
sudden
change
of
place
to
some
threaten
annoyance
on
the
part
of
Count
Fosco
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
perfectly
right

she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
.
<EOS>

the
house
 
but
not
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Laura
never
see

Laura
suspect
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
how
it
happen
:
the
danger
,
I
believe
and
hope
,
be
over
now
.
<EOS>
yesterday

I
be
in
the
sitting
-
room
,
at
our
old
lodging
.
<EOS>
Laura
be
draw
at
the
table
,
and
I
be
walk
about
and
set
thing
to
right
.
<EOS>
I
pass
the
window
,
and
as
I
pass
it
,
look
out
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
there
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
I
see
the
Count
,
with
a
man
talk
to
him
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
he
notice
you
at
the
window
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
 
at
least
,
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
I
be
too
violently
startled
to
be
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
the
other
man
?
<EOS>
a
stranger
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
a
stranger
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
could
draw
my
breath
again
,
I
recognise
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
owner
of
the
Lunatic
Asylum
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
the
Count
point
out
the
house
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
they
be
talk
together
as
if
they
have
accidentally
meet
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
I
remain
at
the
window
look
at
them
from
behind
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
turn
round
,
and
if
Laura
have
see
my
face
at
that
moment
 
<EOS>
thank
God
,
she
be
absorb
over
her
drawing
!
<EOS>
They
soon
part
.
<EOS>
the
man
from
the
Asylum
go
one
way
,
and
the
Count
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
hope
they
be
in
the
street
by
chance
,
till
I
see
the
Count
come
back
,
stop
opposite
to
us
again
,
take
out
his
card
-
case
and
pencil
,
write
something
,
and
then
cross
the
road
to
the
shop
below
us
.
<EOS>
I
run
past
Laura
before
she
could
see
me
,
and
say
I
have
forget
something
upstairs
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
be
out
of
the
room
I
go
down
to
the
first
landing
and
wait
 
<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
stop
him
if
he
try
to
come
upstairs
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
such
attempt
.
<EOS>
the
girl
from
the
shop
come
through
the
door
into
the
passage
,
with
his
card
in
her
hand
 
a
large
gilt
card
with
his
name
,
and
a
coronet
above
it
,
and
these
line
underneath
in
pencil
:
<EOS>
"
dear
lady
"
(
yes
!
<EOS>
the
villain
could
address
me
in
that
way
still
)
 
<EOS>
"
dear
lady
,
one
word
<EOS>
,
I
implore
you
,
on
a
matter
serious
to
us
both
.
<EOS>
"
if
one
can
think
at
all
,
in
serious
difficulty
,
one
think
quick
.
<EOS>
I
feel
directly
that
it
may
be
a
fatal
mistake
to
leave
myself
and
to
leave
you
in
the
dark
,
where
such
a
man
as
the
Count
be
concern
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
the
doubt
of
what
he
may
do
,
in
your
absence
,
would
be
ten
time
more
try
to
me
if
I
decline
to
see
him
than
if
I
consent
.
"
<EOS>
ask
the
gentleman
to
wait
in
the
shop
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
with
him
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
I
run
upstairs
for
my
bonnet
,
be
determine
not
to
let
him
speak
to
me
indoor
.
<EOS>
I
know
his
deep
ringing
voice
,
and
I
be
afraid
Laura
may
hear
it
,
even
in
the
shop
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
a
minute
I
be
down
again
in
the
passage
,
and
have
open
the
door
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
He
come
round
to
meet
me
from
the
shop
.
<EOS>
there
he
be
in
deep
mourning
,
with
his
smooth
bow
and
his
deadly
smile
,
and
some
idle
boy
and
woman
near
him
,
stare
at
his
great
size
,
his
fine
black
clothe
,
and
his
large
cane
with
the
gold
knob
to
it
.
<EOS>
all
the
horrible
time
at
Blackwater
come
back
to
me
the
moment
I
set
eye
on
him
.
<EOS>
all
the
old
loathing
creep
and
crawl
through
me
,
when
he
take
off
his
hat
with
a
flourish
and
speak
to
me
,
as
if
we
have
part
on
the
friendly
term
hardly
a
day
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
what
he
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
repeat
it
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
You
shall
know
directly
what
he
say
about
you
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
repeat
what
he
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
bad
than
the
polite
insolence
of
his
letter
.
<EOS>
My
hand
tingle
to
strike
him
,
as
if
I
have
be
a
man
!
<EOS>
I
only
keep
them
quiet
by
tear
his
card
to
piece
under
my
shawl
.
<EOS>
without
say
a
word
on
my
side
,
I
walk
away
from
the
house
(
for
fear
of
Laura
see
us
)
,
and
he
follow
,
protest
softly
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
by
-
street
I
turn
,
and
ask
him
what
he
want
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
want
two
thing
.
<EOS>
first
,
if
I
have
no
objection
,
to
express
his
sentiment
.
<EOS>
I
decline
to
hear
them
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
to
repeat
the
warning
in
his
letter
.
<EOS>
I
ask
,
what
occasion
there
be
for
repeat
it
.
<EOS>
He
bow
and
smile
,
and
say
he
would
explain
.
<EOS>
the
explanation
exactly
confirm
the
fear
I
express
before
you
leave
us
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
if
you
remember
,
that
Sir
Percival
would
be
too
headstrong
to
take
his
friend
's
advice
where
you
be
concern
,
and
that
there
be
no
danger
to
be
dread
from
the
Count
till
his
own
interest
be
threaten
,
and
he
be
rouse
into
act
for
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
,
Marian

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
so
it
have
really
turn
out
.
<EOS>
the
Count
offer
his
advice
,
but
it
be
refuse
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
would
only
take
counsel
of
his
own
violence
,
his
own
obstinacy
,
and
his
own
hatred
of
you
.
<EOS>
the
Count
let
him
have
his
way
,
first
privately
ascertain
,
in
case
of
his
own
interest
be
threaten
next
,
where
we
live

<EOS>
You

,
and
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
have
make
the
discovery
,
he
take
no
advantage
of
it
till
the
news
reach
him
of
Sir
Percival
's
death
,
and
then
,
as
I
tell
you
,
he
act
for
himself
,
because
he
believe
you
would
next
proceed
against
the
dead
man
's
partner
in
the
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
He
at
once
make
his
arrangement
to
meet
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
in
London
,
and
to
take
him
to
the
place
where
his
runaway
patient
be
hide
,
believe
that
the
result
,
whichever
way
they
end
,
would
be
to
involve
you
in
interminable
legal
dispute
and
difficulty
,
and
to
tie
your
hand
for
all
purpose
of
offence
,
so
far
as
he
be
concerned
.
<EOS>
that
be
his
purpose
,
on
his
own
confession
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
only
consideration
which
make
him
hesitate
,
at
the
last
moment
 
"
  
"
yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
hard
to
acknowledge
it
,
Walter
,
and
yet
I
must
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
only
consideration
.
<EOS>
no
word
can
say
how
degraded
I
feel
in
my
own
estimation
when
I
think
of
it
,
but
the
one
weak
point
in
that
man
's
iron
character
be
the
horrible
admiration
he
feel
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
try
,
for
the
sake
of
my
own
self
-
respect
,
to
disbelieve
it
as
long
as
I
could
;
but
his
look
,
his
action
,
force
on
me
the
shameful
conviction
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
the
eye
of
that
monster
of
wickedness
moisten
while
he
be
speak
to
me
 
<EOS>
they
do
,
Walter
!
<EOS>
He
declare
that
at
the
moment
of
point
out
the
house
to
the
doctor
,
he
think
of
my
misery
if
I
be
separate
from
Laura
,
of
my
responsibility
if
I
be
call
on
to
answer
for
effect
her
escape
,
and
he
risk
the
bad
that
you
could
do
to
him
,
the
second
time
,
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
all
he
ask
be
that
I
would
remember
the
sacrifice
,
and
restrain
your
rashness
,
in
my
own
interest
 
interest
which
he
may
never
be
able
to
consult
again
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
such
bargain
with
him
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
die
first
.
<EOS>
but
believe
him
or
not
,
whether
it
be
true
or
false
that
he
send
the
doctor
away
with
an
excuse
,
one
thing
be
certain
,
I
see
the
man
leave
him
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
our
window
,
or
even
at
our
side
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
the
good
man
be
not
consistent
in
good
 
<EOS>
why
should
the
bad
man
be
consistent
in
evil
?
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
I
suspect
him
of
merely
attempt
to
frighten
you
,
by
threaten
what
he
can
not
really
do
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
his
power
of
annoy
us
,
by
mean
of
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
,
now
that
Sir
Percival
be
dead
,
and
Mrs.
Catherick
be
free
from
all
control
.
<EOS>
but
let
me
hear
more
.
<EOS>
what
do
the
Count
say
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
speak
last
of
you
.
<EOS>
His
eye
brighten
and
harden
,
and
his
manner
change
to
what
I
remember
it
in
past
time
 
to
that
mixture
of
pitiless
resolution
and
mountebank
mockery
which
make
it
so
impossible
to
fathom
him
.
<EOS>
"
Warn
Mr.
Hartright
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
in
his
lofty
manner
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
a
man
of
brain
to
deal
with
,
a
man
who
snap
his
big
finger
at
the
law
and
convention
of
society
,
when
he
measure
himself
with
me
.
<EOS>
if
my
lament
friend
have
take
my
advice
,
the
business
of
the
inquest
would
have
be
with
the
body
of
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
but
my
lament
friend
be
obstinate
.
<EOS>
see
!
<EOS>
I
mourn
his
loss
 
inwardly
in
my
soul
,
outwardly
on
my
hat
.
<EOS>
this
trivial
crape
express
sensibility
which
I
summon
Mr.
Hartright
to
respect
.
<EOS>
They
may
be
transform
to
immeasurable
enmity
if
he
venture
to
disturb
them
.
<EOS>
let
him
be
content
with
what
he
have
get
 
with
what
I
leave
unmoleste
,
for
your
sake
,
to
him
and
to
you
.
<EOS>
say
to
him
(
with
my
compliment
)
,
if
he
stir
me
,
he
have
Fosco
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
in
the
English
of
the
Popular
Tongue
,
I
inform
him
 
Fosco
stick
at
nothing
.
<EOS>
dear
lady
,
good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
cold
grey
eye
settle
on
my
face
 
<EOS>
he
take
off
his
hat
<EOS>
solemnly
 
bow
,
bare
-
head
 
and
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
without
return
?
<EOS>
without
say
more
last
word
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
turn
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
and
wave
his
hand
,
and
then
strike
it
theatrically
on
his
breast
.
<EOS>
I
lose
sight
of
him
after
that
.
<EOS>
He
disappear
in
the
opposite
direction
to
our
house
,
and
I
run
back
to
Laura
.
<EOS>
before
I
be
indoor
again
,
I
have
make
up
my
mind
that
we
must
go
.
<EOS>
the
house
(
especially
in
your
absence
)
be
a
place
of
danger
instead
of
a
place
of
safety
,
now
that
the
Count
have
discover
it
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
have
feel
certain
of
your
return
,
I
should
have
risk
wait
till
you
come
back
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
certain
of
nothing
,
and
I
act
at
once
on
my
own
impulse
.
<EOS>
You
have
speak
,
before
leave
us
,
of
move
into
a
quieter
neighbourhood
and
purer
air
,
for
the
sake
of
Laura
's
health
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
remind
her
of
that
,
and
to
suggest
surprising
you
and
save
you
trouble
by
manage
the
move
in
your
absence
,
to
make
her
quite
as
anxious
for
the
change
as
I
be
.
<EOS>
She
help
me
to
pack
up
your
thing
,
and
she
have
arrange
them
all
for
you
in
your
new
working
-
room
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
make
you
think
of
come
to
this
place
?
"
  
"
My
ignorance
of
other
locality
in
the
neighbourhood
of
London
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
necessity
of
get
as
far
away
as
possible
from
our
old
lodging
,
and
I
know
something
of
Fulham
,
because
I
have
once
be
at
school
there
.
<EOS>
I
despatch
a
messenger
with
a
note
,
on
the
chance
that
the
school
may
still
be
in
existence
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
existence
 
<EOS>
the
daughter
of
my
old
mistress
be
carry
it
on
for
her
,
and
they
engage
this
place
from
the
instruction
I
have
send
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
post
-
time
when
the
messenger
return
to
me
with
the
address
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
We
move
after
dark
 
<EOS>
we
come
here
quite
unobserved
.
<EOS>
have
I
do
right
,
Walter
?
<EOS>
have
I
justify
your
trust
in
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
answer
her
warmly
and
gratefully
,
as
I
really
feel
.
<EOS>
but
the
anxious
look
still
remain
on
her
face
while
I
be
speak
,
and
the
first
question
she
ask
,
when
I
have
do
,
relate
to
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
that
she
be
think
of
him
now
with
a
change
mind
.
<EOS>
no
fresh
outbreak
of
anger
against
him
,
no
new
appeal
to
me
to
hasten
the
day
of
reckoning
escape
her
.
<EOS>
Her
conviction
that
the
man
's
hateful
admiration
of
herself
be
really
sincere
,
seem
to
have
increase
a
hundredfold
her
distrust
of
his
unfathomable
cunning
,
her
inborn
dread
of
the
wicked
energy
and
vigilance
of
all
his
faculty
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
fall
low
,
her
manner
be
hesitate
,
her
eye
search
into
mine
with
an
eager
fear
when
she
ask
me
what
I
think
of
his
message
,
and
what
I
mean
to
do
next
after
hear
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
many
week
have
pass
,
Marian
,
"
I
answer
,
"
since
my
interview
with
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
when
he
and
I
part
,
the
last
word
I
say
to
him
about
Laura
be
these
:
"
Her
uncle
's
house
shall
open
to
receive
her
,
in
the
presence
of
every
soul
who
follow
the
false
funeral
to
the
grave
;
the
lie
that
record
her
death
shall
be
publicly
erase
from
the
tombstone
by
the
authority
of
the
head
of
the
family
,
and
the
two
man
who
have
wrong
her
shall
answer
for
their
crime
to
me
,
though
the
justice
that
sit
in
tribunal
be
powerless
to
pursue
them
.
<EOS>
"
one
of
those
man
be
beyond
mortal
reach
.
<EOS>
the
other
remain
,
and
my
resolution
remain
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
eye
light
up
 
her
colour
rise
.
<EOS>
She
say
nothing
,
but
I
see
all
her
sympathy
gather
to
mine
in
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
disguise
from
myself
,
or
from
you
,
"
I
go
on
,
"
that
the
prospect
before
us
be
more
than
doubtful
.
<EOS>
the
risk
we
have
run
already
be
,
it
may
be
,
trifle
compare
with
the
risk
that
threaten
us
in
the
future
,
but
the
venture
shall
be
try
,
Marian
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
rash
enough
to
measure
myself
against
such
a
man
as
the
Count
before
I
be
well
prepared
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
learn
patience
 
<EOS>
I
can
wait
my
time
.
<EOS>
let
him
believe
that
his
message
have
produce
its
effect
 
let
him
know
nothing
of
us
,
and
hear
nothing
of
us
 
let
us
give
him
full
time
to
feel
secure
 
his
own
boastful
nature
,
unless
I
seriously
mistake
him
,
will
hasten
that
result
.
<EOS>
this
be
one
reason
for
waiting
,
but
there
be
another
more
important
still
.
<EOS>
My
position
,
Marian
,
towards
you
and
towards
Laura
ought
to
be
a
strong
one
than
it
be
now
before
I
try
our
last
chance
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
lean
near
to
me
,
with
a
look
of
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
it
be
strong
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
"
I
reply
,
"
when
the
time
come
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
come
yet
 
<EOS>
it
may
never
come
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
silent
about
it
to
Laura
for
ever
 
<EOS>
I
must
be
silent
now
,
even
to
you
,
till
I
see
for
myself
that
I
can
harmlessly
and
honourably
speak
.
<EOS>
let
us
leave
that
subject
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
which
have
more
press
claim
on
our
attention
.
<EOS>
You
have
keep
Laura
,
mercifully
keep
her
,
in
ignorance
of
her
husband
's
death
 
"
  
"
oh
,
Walter
,
surely
it
must
be
long
yet
before
we
tell
her
of
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
better
that
you
should
reveal
it
to
her
now
,
than
<EOS>
that
accident
,
which
no
one
can
guard
against
,
should
reveal
it
to
her
at
some
future
time
.
<EOS>
spare
her
all
the
detail
 
break
it
to
her
very
tenderly
,
but
tell
her
that
he
be
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
reason
,
Walter
,
for
wish
her
to
know
of
her
husband
's
death
besides
the
reason
you
have
just
mention
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
reason
connect
with
that
subject
which
must
not
be
mention
between
us
yet
?
 
<EOS>
which
may
never
be
mention
to
Laura
at
all
?

"
  
<EOS>
She
dwell
on
the
last
word
meaningly
.
<EOS>
when
I
answer
her
in
the
affirmative
,
I
dwelt
on
them
too
.
  
<EOS>
Her
face
grow
pale
.
<EOS>
for
a
while
she
look
at
me
with
a
sad
,
hesitate
interest
.
<EOS>
an
unaccustomed
tenderness
tremble
in
her
dark
eye
and
soften
her
firm
lip
,
as
she
glance
aside
at
the
empty
chair
in
which
the
dear
companion
of
all
our
joy
and
sorrow
have
be
sit
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
understand
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
owe
it
to
her
and
to
you
,
Walter
,
to
tell
her
of
her
husband
's
death
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
sigh
,
and
hold
my
hand
fast
for
a
moment
 
then
drop
it
abruptly
,
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
Laura
know
that
his
death
have
release
her
,
and
that
the
error
and
the
calamity
of
her
life
lie
bury
in
his
tomb
.
  
<EOS>
His
name
be
mention
among
us
no
more
.
<EOS>
thenceforward
,
we
shrink
from
the
slight
approach
to
the
subject
of
his
death
,
and
in
the
same
scrupulous
manner
,
Marian
and
I
avoid
all
further
reference
to
that
other
subject
,
which
,
by
her
consent
and
mine
,
be
not
to
be
mention
between
us
yet
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
less
present
in
our
mind
 
<EOS>
it
be
rather
keep
alive
in
them
by
the
restraint
which
we
have
impose
on
ourselves
.
<EOS>
We
both
watch
Laura
more
anxiously
than
ever
,
sometimes
wait
and
hope
,
sometimes
wait
and
fear
,
till
the
time
come
.
  
<EOS>
by
degree
we
return
to
our
accustomed
way
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
resume
the
daily
work
,
which
have
be
suspend
during
my
absence
in
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
Our
new
lodging
cost
us
more
than
the
small
and
less
convenient
room
which
we
have
leave
,
and
the
claim
thus
imply
on
my
increase
exertion
be
strengthen
by
the
doubtfulness
of
our
future
prospect
.
<EOS>
emergency
may
yet
happen
which
would
exhaust
our
little
fund
at
the
banker
's
,
and
the
work
of
my
hand
may
be
,
ultimately
,
all
we
have
to
look
to
for
support
.
<EOS>
more
permanent
and
more
lucrative
employment
than
have
yet
be
offer
to
me
be
a
necessity
of
our
position
 
a
necessity
for
which
I
now
diligently
set
myself
to
provide
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
that
the
interval
of
rest
and
seclusion
of
which
I
be
now
write
,
entirely
suspend
,
on
my
part
,
all
pursuit
of
the
one
absorb
purpose
with
which
my
thought
and
action
be
associate
in
these
page
.
<EOS>
that
purpose
be
,
for
month
and
month
yet
,
never
to
relax
its
claim
on
me
.
<EOS>
the
slow
ripening
of
it
still
leave
me
a
measure
of
precaution
to
take
,
an
obligation
of
gratitude
to
perform
,
and
a
doubtful
question
to
solve
.
  
<EOS>
the
measure
of
precaution
relate
,
necessarily
,
to
the
Count
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
the
last
importance
to
ascertain
,
if
possible
,
whether
his
plan
commit
him
to
remain
in
England
 
or
,
in
other
word
,
to
remain
within
my
reach
.
<EOS>
I
contrive
to
set
this
doubt
at
rest
by
very
simple
mean
.
<EOS>
His
address
in
St.
John
's
Wood
be
know
to
me
,
I
inquire
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
have
find
out
the
agent
who
have
the
disposal
of
the
furnished
house
in
which
he
live
,
I
ask
if
number
five
,
Forest
Road
,
be
likely
to
be
let
within
a
reasonable
time
.
<EOS>
the
reply
be
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
I
be
inform
that
the
foreign
gentleman
then
reside
in
the
house
have
renew
his
term
of
occupation
for
another
six
month
,
and
would
remain
in
possession
until
the
end
of
June
in
the
following
year
.
<EOS>
We
be
then
at
the
beginning
of
December
only
.
<EOS>
I
leave
the
agent
with
my
mind
relieve
from
all
present
fear
of
the
Count
's
escape
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
obligation
I
have
to
perform
take
me
once
more
into
the
presence
of
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
I
have
promise
to
return
,
and
to
confide
to
her
those
particular
relate
to
the
death
and
burial
of
Anne
Catherick
which
I
have
be
oblige
to
withhold
at
our
first
interview
.
<EOS>
change
as
circumstance
now
be
,
there
be
no
hindrance
to
my
trusting
the
good
woman
with
as
much
of
the
story
of
the
conspiracy
as
it
be
necessary
to
tell
.
<EOS>
I
have
every
reason
that
sympathy
and
friendly
feeling
could
suggest
to
urge
on
me
the
speedy
performance
of
my
promise
,
and
I
do
conscientiously
and
carefully
perform
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
to
burden
these
page
with
any
statement
of
what
pass
at
the
interview
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
more
to
the
purpose
to
say
,
that
the
interview
itself
necessarily
bring
to
my
mind
the
one
doubtful
question
still
remain
to
be
solve
 
the
question
of
Anne
Catherick
's
parentage
on
the
father
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
a
multitude
of
small
consideration
in
connection
with
this
subject
 
trifle
enough
in
themselves
,
but
strikingly
important
when
mass
together
 
have
latterly
lead
my
mind
to
a
conclusion
which
I
resolve
to
verify
.
<EOS>
I
obtain
Marian
's
permission
to
write
to
Major
Donthorne
,
of
Varneck
Hall
(
where
Mrs.
Catherick
have
live
in
service
for
some
year
previous
to
her
marriage
)
,
to
ask
him
certain
question
.
<EOS>
I
make
the
inquiry
in
Marian
's
name
,
and
describe
them
as
relate
to
matter
of
personal
history
in
her
family
,
which
may
explain
and
excuse
my
application
.
<EOS>
when
I
write
the
letter
I
have
no
certain
knowledge
that
Major
Donthorne
be
still
alive
 
<EOS>
I
despatch
it
on
the
chance
that
he
may
be
live
,
and
able
and
willing
to
reply
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
lapse
of
two
day
proof
come
,
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
,
that
the
Major
be
live
,
and
that
he
be
ready
to
help
us
.
  
<EOS>
the
idea
in
my
mind
when
I
write
to
him
,
and
the
nature
of
my
inquiry
will
be
easily
infer
from
his
reply
.
<EOS>
His
letter
answer
my
question
by
communicate
these
important
fact
    
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
"
the
late
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
of
Blackwater
Park
,
"
have
never
set
foot
in
Varneck
Hall
.
<EOS>
the
deceased
gentleman
be
a
total
stranger
to
Major
Donthorne
,
and
to
all
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
second
place
,
"
the
late
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
,
of
Limmeridge
House
,
"
have
be
,
in
his
young
day
,
the
intimate
friend
and
constant
guest
of
Major
Donthorne
.
<EOS>
have
refresh
his
memory
by
look
back
to
old
letter
and
other
paper
,
the
Major
be
in
a
position
to
say
positively
that
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
be
stay
at
Varneck
Hall
in
the
month
of
August
,
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
six
,
and
that
he
remain
there
for
the
shooting
during
the
month
of
September
and
part
of
October
follow
.
<EOS>
He
then
leave
,
to
the
good
of
the
Major
's
belief
,
for
Scotland
,
and
do
not
return
to
Varneck
Hall
till
after
a
lapse
of
time
,
when
he
reappear
in
the
character
of
a
newly
-
married
man
.
  
<EOS>
take
by
itself
,
this
statement
be
,
perhaps
,
of
little
positive
value
,
but
take
in
connection
with
certain
fact
,
every
one
of
which
either
Marian
or
I
know
to
be
true
,
it
suggest
one
plain
conclusion
that
be
,
to
our
mind
,
irresistible
.
  
<EOS>
Knowing
,
now
,
that
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
have
be
at
Varneck
Hall
in
the
autumn
of
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
six
,
and
that
Mrs.
Catherick
have
be
live
there
in
service
at
the
same
time
,
we
know
also
 
first
,
that
Anne
have
be
bear
in
June
,
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
seven
;
secondly
,
that
she
have
always
present
an
extraordinary
personal
resemblance
to
Laura
;
and
,
thirdly
,
that
Laura
herself
be
strikingly
like
her
father
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
have
be
one
of
the
notoriously
handsome
man
of
his
time
.
<EOS>
in
disposition
entirely
unlike
his
brother
Frederick
,
he
be
the
spoilt
darling
of
society
,
especially
of
the
woman
 
<EOS>
an
easy
,
light
-
hearted
,
impulsive
,
affectionate
man
 
generous
to
a
fault
 
constitutionally
lax
in
his
principle
,
and
notoriously
thoughtless
of
moral
obligation
where
woman
be
concern
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
fact
we
know
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
character
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
surely
the
plain
inference
that
follow
need
no
point
out
?
  
<EOS>
Read
by
the
new
light
which
have
now
break
upon
me
,
even
Mrs.
Catherick
's
letter
,
in
despite
of
herself
,
render
its
mite
of
assistance
towards
strengthen
the
conclusion
at
which
I
have
arrive
.
<EOS>
She
have
describe
Mrs.
Fairlie
(
in
write
to
me
)
as
"
plain
-
look
,
"
and
as
have
"
entrap
the
handsome
man
in
England
into
marry
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
both
assertion
be
gratuitously
make
,
and
both
be
false
.
<EOS>
jealous
dislike
(
which
,
in
such
a
woman
as
Mrs.
Catherick
,
would
express
itself
in
petty
malice
rather
than
not
express
itself
at
all
)
appear
to
me
to
be
the
only
assignable
cause
for
the
peculiar
insolence
of
her
reference
to
Mrs.
Fairlie
,
under
circumstance
which
do
not
necessitate
any
reference
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
mention
here
of
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
name
naturally
suggest
one
other
question
.
<EOS>
do
she
ever
suspect
whose
child
the
little
girl
bring
to
her
at
Limmeridge
may
be
?
  
<EOS>
Marian
's
testimony
be
positive
on
this
point
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
letter
to
her
husband
,
which
have
be
read
to
me
in
former
day
 
the
letter
describe
Anne
's
resemblance
to
Laura
,
and
acknowledge
her
affectionate
interest
in
the
little
stranger
 
have
be
write
,
beyond
all
question
,
in
perfect
innocence
of
heart
.
<EOS>
It
even
seem
doubtful
,
on
consideration
,
whether
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
himself
have
be
near
than
his
wife
to
any
suspicion
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
the
disgracefully
deceitful
circumstance
under
which
Mrs.
Catherick
have
marry
,
the
purpose
of
concealment
which
the
marriage
be
intend
to
answer
,
may
well
keep
her
silent
for
caution
's
sake
,
perhaps
for
her
own
pride
's
sake
also
,
even
assume
that
she
have
the
mean
,
in
his
absence
,
of
communicate
with
the
father
of
her
unborn
child
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
surmise
float
through
my
mind
,
there
rise
on
my
memory
the
remembrance
of
the
scripture
denunciation
which
we
have
all
think
of
in
our
time
with
wonder
and
with
awe
:
"
<EOS>
the
sin
of
the
father
shall
be
visit
on
the
child
.
"
<EOS>
but
for
the
fatal
resemblance
between
the
two
daughter
of
one
father
,
the
conspiracy
of
which
Anne
have
be
the
innocent
instrument
and
Laura
<EOS>
the
innocent
victim
could
never
have
be
plan
.
<EOS>
with
what
unerring
and
terrible
directness
the
long
chain
of
circumstance
lead
down
from
the
thoughtless
wrong
commit
by
the
father
to
the
heartless
injury
inflict
on
the
child
!
  
<EOS>
these
thought
come
to
me
,
and
other
with
them
,
which
draw
my
mind
away
to
the
little
Cumberland
churchyard
where
Anne
Catherick
now
lie
bury
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
bygone
day
when
I
have
meet
her
by
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
,
and
meet
her
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
her
poor
helpless
hand
beat
on
the
tombstone
,
and
her
weary
,
yearn
word
,
murmur
to
the
dead
remain
of
her
protectress
and
her
friend
:
"
oh
,
if
I
could
die
,
and
be
hide
and
at
rest
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
little
more
than
a
year
have
pass
since
she
breathe
that
wish
;
and
how
inscrutably
,
how
awfully
,
it
have
be
fulfil
!
<EOS>
the
word
she
have
speak
to
Laura
by
the
shore
of
the
lake
,
the
very
word
have
now
come
true
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
if
I
could
only
be
bury
with
your
mother
!
<EOS>
if
I
could
only
wake
at
her
side
when
the
angel
's
trumpet
sound
and
the
grave
give
up
their
dead
at
the
resurrection
!
"
<EOS>
through
what
mortal
crime
and
horror
,
through
what
dark
winding
of
the
way
down
to
death
 
<EOS>
the
lose
creature
have
wander
in
God
's
lead
to
the
last
home
that
,
live
,
she
never
hope
to
reach
!
<EOS>
in
that
sacred
rest
I
leave
her
 
in
that
dread
companionship
<EOS>
let
her
remain
undisturbed
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
ghostly
figure
which
have
haunt
these
page
,
as
it
haunt
my
life
,
go
down
into
the
impenetrable
gloom
.
<EOS>
like
a
shadow
she
first
come
to
me
in
the
loneliness
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
like
a
shadow
she
pass
away
in
the
loneliness
of
the
dead
.
    
<EOS>
four
month
elapse
.
<EOS>
April
come
 
the
month
of
spring
 
the
month
of
change
.
  
<EOS>
the
course
of
time
have
flow
through
the
interval
since
the
winter
peacefully
and
happily
in
our
new
home
.
<EOS>
I
have
turn
my
long
leisure
to
good
account
,
have
largely
increase
my
source
of
employment
,
and
have
place
our
mean
of
subsistence
on
sure
ground
.
<EOS>
free
from
the
suspense
and
the
anxiety
which
have
try
her
so
sorely
and
hang
over
her
so
long
,
Marian
's
spirit
rally
,
and
her
natural
energy
of
character
begin
to
assert
itself
again
,
with
something
,
if
not
all
,
of
the
freedom
and
the
vigour
of
former
time
.
  
<EOS>
more
pliable
under
change
than
her
sister
,
Laura
show
more
plainly
the
progress
make
by
the
healing
influence
of
her
new
life
.
<EOS>
the
worn
and
waste
look
which
have
prematurely
age
her
face
be
fast
leave
it
,
and
the
expression
which
have
be
the
first
of
its
charm
in
past
day
be
the
first
of
its
beauty
that
now
return
.
<EOS>
My
close
observation
of
her
detect
but
<EOS>
one
serious
result
of
the
conspiracy
which
have
once
threaten
her
reason
and
her
life
.
<EOS>
Her
memory
of
event
,
from
the
period
of
her
leave
Blackwater
Park
to
the
period
of
our
meeting
in
the
burial
-
ground
of
Limmeridge
Church
,
be
lose
beyond
all
hope
of
recovery
.
<EOS>
at
the
slight
reference
to
that
time
she
change
and
tremble
still
,
her
word
become
confused
,
her
memory
wander
and
lose
itself
as
helplessly
as
ever
.
<EOS>
here
,
and
here
only
,
the
trace
of
the
past
lie
deep
 
too
deep
to
be
efface
.
  
<EOS>
in
all
else
she
be
now
so
far
on
the
way
to
recovery
that
,
on
her
good
and
bright
day
,
she
sometimes
look
and
speak
like
the
Laura
of
old
time
.
<EOS>
the
happy
change
work
its
natural
result
in
us
both
.
<EOS>
from
their
long
slumber
,
on
her
side
and
on
mine
,
those
imperishable
memory
of
our
past
life
in
Cumberland
now
awoke
,
which
be
one
and
all
alike
,
the
memory
of
our
love
.
  
<EOS>
gradually
and
insensibly
our
daily
relation
towards
each
other
become
constrained
.
<EOS>
the
fond
word
which
I
have
speak
to
her
so
naturally
,
in
the
day
of
her
sorrow
and
her
suffering
,
falter
strangely
on
my
lip
.
<EOS>
in
the
time
when
my
dread
of
lose
her
be
most
present
to
my
mind
,
I
have
always
kiss
her
when
she
leave
me
at
night
and
when
she
meet
me
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
kiss
seem
now
to
have
drop
between
us
 
to
be
lose
out
of
our
life
.
<EOS>
Our
hand
begin
to
tremble
again
when
they
meet
.
<EOS>
We
hardly
ever
look
long
at
one
another
out
of
Marian
's
presence
.
<EOS>
the
talk
often
flag
between
us
when
we
be
alone
.
<EOS>
when
I
touch
her
by
accident
<EOS>
I
feel
my
heart
beat
fast
,
as
it
use
to
beat
at
Limmeridge
House
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
lovely
answer
flush
glow
again
in
her
cheek
,
as
if
we
be
back
among
the
Cumberland
Hills
in
our
past
character
of
master
and
pupil
once
more
.
<EOS>
She
have
long
interval
of
silence
and
thoughtfulness
,
and
deny
she
have
be
think
when
Marian
ask
her
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
surprise
myself
one
day
neglect
my
work
to
dream
over
the
little
water
-
colour
portrait
of
her
which
I
have
take
in
the
summer
-
house
where
we
first
meet
 
just
as
I
use
to
neglect
Mr.
Fairlie
's
drawing
to
dream
over
the
same
likeness
when
it
be
newly
finish
in
the
bygone
time
.
<EOS>
change
as
all
the
circumstance
now
be
,
our
position
towards
each
other
in
the
golden
day
of
our
first
companionship
seem
to
be
revive
with
the
revival
of
our
love
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
Time
have
drift
us
back
on
the
wreck
of
our
early
hope
to
the
old
familiar
shore
!
  
<EOS>
to
any
other
woman
I
could
have
speak
the
decisive
word
which
I
still
hesitate
to
speak
to
HER
.
<EOS>
the
utter
helplessness
of
her
position
 
her
friendless
dependence
on
all
the
forbear
gentleness
that
I
could
show
her
 
my
fear
of
touch
too
soon
some
secret
sensitiveness
in
her
which
<EOS>
my
instinct
as
a
man
may
not
have
be
fine
enough
to
discover
 
these
consideration
,
and
other
like
them
,
keep
me
self
-
distrustfully
silent
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
know
that
the
restraint
on
both
side
must
be
end
,
that
the
relation
in
which
we
stand
towards
one
another
must
be
alter
in
some
settle
manner
for
the
future
,
and
that
it
rest
with
me
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
recognise
the
necessity
for
a
change
.
  
<EOS>
the
more
I
think
of
our
position
,
the
hard
the
attempt
to
alter
it
appear
,
while
the
domestic
condition
on
which
we
three
have
be
live
together
since
the
winter
remain
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
account
for
the
capricious
state
of
mind
in
which
this
feeling
originate
,
but
the
idea
nevertheless
possess
me
that
some
previous
change
of
place
and
circumstance
,
some
sudden
break
in
the
quiet
monotony
of
our
life
,
so
manage
as
to
vary
the
home
aspect
under
which
we
have
be
accustomed
to
see
each
other
,
may
prepare
the
way
for
me
to
speak
,
and
may
make
it
easy
and
less
embarrassing
for
Laura
and
Marian
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
purpose
in
view
,
I
say
,
one
morning
,
that
I
think
we
have
all
earn
a
little
holiday
and
a
change
of
scene
.
<EOS>
after
some
consideration
,
it
be
decide
that
we
should
go
for
a
fortnight
to
the
sea
-
side
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
we
leave
Fulham
for
a
quiet
town
on
the
south
coast
.
<EOS>
at
that
early
season
of
the
year
we
be
the
only
visitor
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
the
cliff
,
the
beach
,
and
the
walk
inland
be
all
in
the
solitary
condition
which
be
most
welcome
to
us
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
mild
 
the
prospect
over
hill
and
wood
and
down
be
beautifully
vary
by
the
shift
April
light
and
shade
,
and
the
restless
sea
leapt
under
our
window
,
as
if
it
feel
,
like
the
land
,
the
glow
and
freshness
of
spring
.
  
<EOS>
I
owe
it
to
Marian
to
consult
her
before
I
speak
to
Laura
,
and
to
be
guide
afterwards
by
her
advice
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
third
day
from
our
arrival
I
find
a
fit
opportunity
of
speak
to
her
alone
.
<EOS>
the
moment
we
look
at
one
another
,
her
quick
instinct
detect
the
thought
in
my
mind
before
I
could
give
it
expression
.
<EOS>
with
her
customary
energy
and
directness
she
speak
at
once
,
and
speak
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
think
of
that
subject
which
be
mention
between
us
on
the
evening
of
your
return
from
Hampshire
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
expect
you
to
allude
to
it
for
some
time
past
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
a
change
in
our
little
household
,
Walter
,
we
can
not
go
on
much
longer
as
we
be
now
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
as
plainly
as
you
do
 
as
plainly
as
Laura
see
it
,
though
she
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
how
strangely
the
old
time
in
Cumberland
seem
to
have
come
back
!
<EOS>
You
and
I
be
together
again
,
and
the
one
subject
of
interest
between
us
be
Laura
once
more
.
<EOS>
I
could
almost
fancy
that
this
room
be
the
summer
-
house
at
Limmeridge
,
and
that
those
wave
beyond
us
be
beat
on
our
sea
-
shore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
guide
by
your
advice
in
those
past
day
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
now
,
Marian
,
with
reliance
tenfold
great
I
will
be
guide
by
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
answer
by
press
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
she
be
deeply
touch
by
my
reference
to
the
past
.
<EOS>
We
sit
together
near
the
window
,
and
while
I
speak
<EOS>
and
she
listen
<EOS>
,
we
look
at
the
glory
of
the
sunlight
shine
on
the
majesty
of
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
"
whatever
come
of
this
confidence
between
us
,
"
I
say
,
"
whether
it
end
happily
or
sorrowfully
for
me
,
Laura
's
interest
will
still
be
the
interest
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
when
we
leave
this
place
,
on
whatever
term
we
leave
it
,
my
determination
to
wrest
from
Count
Fosco
the
confession
which
I
fail
to
obtain
from
his
accomplice
,
go
back
with
me
to
London
,
as
certainly
as
I
go
back
myself
.
<EOS>
neither
you
nor
I
can
tell
how
that
man
may
turn
on
me
,
if
I
bring
him
to
bay
;
we
only
know
,
by
his
own
word
and
action
,
that
he
be
capable
of
strike
at
me
through
Laura
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
or
a
moment
's
remorse
.
<EOS>
in
our
present
position
I
have
no
claim
on
her
which
society
sanction
,
which
the
law
allow
,
to
strengthen
me
in
resist
him
,
and
in
protect
her
.
<EOS>
this
place
me
at
a
serious
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
fight
our
cause
with
the
Count
,
strong
in
the
consciousness
of
Laura
's
safety
,
I
must
fight
it
for
my
Wife
.
<EOS>
do
you
agree
to
that
,
Marian
,
so
far
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
every
word
of
it
,
"
she
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
plead
out
of
my
own
heart
,
"
I
go
on
;
"
I
will
not
appeal
to
the
love
which
have
survive
all
change
and
all
shock
 
I
will
rest
my
only
vindication
of
myself
for
think
of
her
,
and
speak
of
her
as
my
wife
,
on
what
I
have
just
say
.
<EOS>
if
the
chance
of
force
a
confession
from
the
Count
be
,
as
I
believe
it
to
be
,
the
last
chance
leave
of
publicly
establish
the
fact
of
Laura
's
existence
,
the
least
selfish
reason
that
I
can
advance
for
our
marriage
be
recognise
by
us
both
.
<EOS>
but
I
may
be
wrong
in
my
conviction
 
<EOS>
other
mean
of
achieve
our
purpose
may
be
in
our
power
,
which
be
less
uncertain
and
less
dangerous
.
<EOS>
I
have
search
anxiously
,
in
my
own
mind
,
for
those
mean
,
and
I
have
not
find
them
.
<EOS>
have
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
about
it
too
,
and
think
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
all
likelihood
,
"
I
continue
,
"
the
same
question
have
occur
to
you
,
in
consider
this
difficult
subject
,
which
have
occur
to
me
.
<EOS>
Ought
we
to
return
with
her
to
Limmeridge
,
now
that
she
be
like
herself
again
,
and
trust
to
the
recognition
of
her
by
the
people
of
the
village
,
or
by
the
child
at
the
school
?
<EOS>
Ought
we
to
appeal
to
the
practical
test
of
her
handwriting
?
<EOS>
suppose
we
do
so
.
<EOS>
suppose
the
recognition
of
her
obtain
,
and
the
identity
of
the
handwriting
establish
.
<EOS>
Would
success
in
both
those
case
do
more
than
supply
an
excellent
foundation
for
a
trial
in
a
court
of
law
?
<EOS>
Would
the
recognition
and
the
handwriting
prove
her
identity
to
Mr.
Fairlie
and
take
her
back
to
Limmeridge
House
,
against
the
evidence
of
her
aunt
,
against
the
evidence
of
the
medical
certificate
,
against
the
fact
of
the
funeral
and
the
fact
of
the
inscription
on
the
tomb
?
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
We
could
only
hope
to
succeed
in
throw
a
serious
doubt
on
the
assertion
of
her
death
,
a
doubt
which
nothing
short
of
a
legal
inquiry
can
settle
.
<EOS>
I
will
assume
that
we
possess
(
what
we
have
certainly
not
get
)
<EOS>
money
enough
to
carry
this
inquiry
on
through
all
its
stage
.
<EOS>
I
will
assume
that
Mr.
Fairlie
's
prejudice
may
be
reason
away
 
that
the
false
testimony
of
the
Count
and
his
wife
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
false
testimony
,
may
be
confute
 
that
the
recognition
could
not
possibly
be
ascribe
to
a
mistake
between
Laura
and
Anne
Catherick
,
or
the
handwriting
be
declare
by
our
enemy
to
be
a
clever
fraud
 
all
these
be
assumption
which
,
more
or
less
,
set
plain
probability
at
defiance
;
but
let
them
pass
 
and
let
us
ask
ourselves
what
would
be
the
first
consequence
or
the
first
question
put
to
Laura
herself
on
the
subject
of
the
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
We
know
only
too
well
what
the
consequence
would
be
,
for
we
know
that
she
have
never
recover
her
memory
of
what
happen
to
her
in
London
.
<EOS>
examine
her
privately
,
or
examine
her
publicly
,
she
be
utterly
incapable
of
assist
the
assertion
of
her
own
case
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
see
this
,
Marian
,
as
plainly
as
I
see
it
,
we
will
go
to
Limmeridge
and
try
the
experiment
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
see
it
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
even
if
we
have
the
mean
of
pay
all
the
law
expense
,
even
if
we
succeed
in
the
end
,
the
delay
would
be
unendurable
,
the
perpetual
suspense
,
after
what
we
have
suffer
already
,
would
be
heartbreake
.
<EOS>
You
be
right
about
the
hopelessness
of
go
to
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
feel
sure
that
you
be
right
also
in
determine
to
try
that
last
chance
with
the
Count
.
<EOS>
be
it
a
chance
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
beyond
a
doubt
,
yes
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
chance
of
recover
the
lose
date
of
Laura
's
journey
to
London
.
<EOS>
without
return
to
the
reason
I
give
you
some
time
since
,
I
be
still
as
firmly
persuade
as
ever
that
there
be
a
discrepancy
between
the
date
of
that
journey
and
the
date
on
the
certificate
of
death
.
<EOS>
there
lie
the
weak
point
of
the
whole
conspiracy
 
<EOS>
it
crumble
to
piece
if
we
attack
it
in
that
way
,
and
the
mean
of
attack
it
be
in
possession
of
the
Count
.
<EOS>
if
I
succeed
in
wrest
them
from
him
,
the
object
of
your
life
and
mine
be
fulfil
.
<EOS>
if
I
fail
,
the
wrong
that
Laura
have
suffer
will
,
in
this
world
,
never
be
redress
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
fear
failure
yourself
,
Walter
?
"
  
"
I
dare
not
anticipate
success
,
and
for
that
very
reason
,
Marian
,
I
speak
openly
and
plainly
as
I
have
speak
now
.
<EOS>
in
my
heart
and
my
conscience
I
can
say
it
,
Laura
's
hope
for
the
future
be
at
their
low
ebb
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
her
fortune
be
go
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
last
chance
of
restore
her
to
her
place
in
the
world
lie
at
the
mercy
of
her
bad
enemy
,
of
a
man
who
be
now
absolutely
unassailable
,
and
who
may
remain
unassailable
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
with
every
worldly
advantage
go
from
her
,
with
all
prospect
of
recover
her
rank
and
station
more
than
doubtful
,
with
no
clear
future
before
her
than
the
future
which
her
husband
can
provide
,
the
poor
drawing
-
master
may
harmlessly
open
his
heart
at
last
.
<EOS>
in
the
day
of
her
prosperity
,
Marian
,
I
be
only
the
teacher
who
guide
her
hand
 
<EOS>
I
ask
for
it
,
in
her
adversity
,
as
the
hand
of
my
wife
!
"
  
<EOS>
Marian
's
eye
meet
mine
affectionately
 
<EOS>
I
could
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
My
heart
be
full
,
my
lip
be
tremble
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
myself
I
be
in
danger
of
appeal
to
her
pity
.
<EOS>
I
get
up
to
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
rise
at
the
same
moment
,
lay
her
hand
gently
on
my
shoulder
,
and
stop
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
"
I
once
part
you
both
,
for
your
good
and
for
her
.
<EOS>
wait
here
,
my
brother
!
 
<EOS>
wait
,
my
dear
,
good
friend
,
till
Laura
come
,
and
tell
you
what
I
have
do
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
since
the
farewell
morning
at
Limmeridge
<EOS>
she
touch
my
forehead
with
her
lip
.
<EOS>
a
tear
drop
on
my
face
as
she
kiss
me
.
<EOS>
She
turn
quickly
,
point
to
the
chair
from
which
I
have
rise
,
and
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
sit
down
alone
at
the
window
to
wait
through
the
crisis
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
My
mind
in
that
breathless
interval
feel
like
a
total
blank
.
<EOS>
I
be
conscious
of
nothing
but
a
painful
intensity
of
all
familiar
perception
.
<EOS>
the
sun
grow
blind
bright
,
the
white
sea
bird
chase
each
other
far
beyond
me
seem
to
be
flit
before
my
face
,
<EOS>
the
mellow
murmur
of
the
wave
on
the
beach
be
like
thunder
in
my
ear
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
open
,
and
Laura
come
in
alone
.
<EOS>
so
she
have
enter
the
breakfast
-
room
at
Limmeridge
House
on
the
morning
when
we
part
.
<EOS>
slowly
and
falteringly
,
in
sorrow
and
in
hesitation
,
she
have
once
approach
me
.
<EOS>
now
she
come
with
the
haste
of
happiness
in
her
foot
,
with
the
light
of
happiness
radiant
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
of
their
own
accord
those
dear
arm
clasp
themselves
round
me
,
of
their
own
accord
the
sweet
lip
come
to
meet
mine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
darling
!
"
<EOS>
she
whisper
,
"
we
may
own
we
love
each
other
now
?
"
<EOS>
Her
head
nestle
with
a
tender
contentedness
on
my
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
she
say
innocently
,
"
I
be
so
happy
at
last
!
"
  
<EOS>
ten
day
later
we
be
happy
still
.
<EOS>
We
be
married
.
    
<EOS>
the
course
of
this
narrative
,
steadily
flow
on
,
bear
me
away
from
the
morning
-
time
of
our
married
life
,
and
carry
me
forward
to
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
fortnight
more
we
three
be
back
in
London
,
and
the
shadow
be
steal
over
us
of
the
struggle
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Marian
and
I
be
careful
to
keep
Laura
in
ignorance
of
the
cause
that
have
hurry
us
back
 
the
necessity
of
make
sure
of
the
Count
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
beginning
of
May
,
and
his
term
of
occupation
at
the
house
in
Forest
Road
expire
in
June
.
<EOS>
if
he
renew
it
(
and
I
have
reason
,
shortly
to
be
mention
,
for
anticipate
that
he
would
)
,
I
may
be
certain
of
his
not
escape
me
.
<EOS>
but
if
by
any
chance
he
disappoint
my
expectation
and
leave
the
country
,
then
I
have
no
time
to
lose
in
arm
myself
to
meet
him
as
I
best
may
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
fulness
of
my
new
happiness
,
there
have
be
moment
when
my
resolution
falter
 
moment
when
I
be
tempt
to
be
safely
content
,
now
that
the
dear
aspiration
of
my
life
be
fulfil
in
the
possession
of
Laura
's
love
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
I
think
faint
-
heartedly
of
the
greatness
of
the
risk
,
of
the
adverse
chance
array
against
me
,
of
the
fair
promise
of
our
new
life
,
and
of
the
peril
in
which
I
may
place
the
happiness
which
we
have
so
hardly
earn
.
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
let
me
own
it
honestly
.
<EOS>
for
a
brief
time
I
wander
,
in
the
sweet
guiding
of
love
,
far
from
the
purpose
to
which
I
have
be
true
under
sterner
discipline
and
in
dark
day
.
<EOS>
innocently
Laura
have
tempt
me
aside
from
the
hard
path
 
<EOS>
innocently
she
be
destine
to
lead
me
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
at
time
,
dream
of
the
terrible
past
still
disconnectedly
recalled
to
her
,
in
the
mystery
of
sleep
,
the
event
of
which
her
wake
memory
have
lose
all
trace
.
<EOS>
one
night
(
barely
two
week
after
our
marriage
)
,
when
I
be
watch
her
at
rest
,
I
see
the
tear
come
slowly
through
her
closed
eyelid
,
I
hear
the
faint
murmuring
word
escape
her
which
tell
me
that
her
spirit
be
back
again
on
the
fatal
journey
from
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
that
unconscious
appeal
,
so
touching
and
so
awful
in
the
sacredness
of
her
sleep
,
run
through
me
like
fire
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
be
the
day
we
come
back
to
London
 
<EOS>
the
day
when
my
resolution
return
to
me
with
tenfold
strength
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
necessity
be
to
know
something
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
thus
far
,
the
true
story
of
his
life
be
an
impenetrable
mystery
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
begin
with
such
scanty
source
of
information
as
be
at
my
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
the
important
narrative
write
by
Mr.
Frederick
Fairlie
(
which
Marian
have
obtain
by
follow
the
direction
I
have
give
to
her
in
the
winter
)
prove
to
be
of
no
service
to
the
special
object
with
which
I
now
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
while
read
it
I
reconsider
the
disclosure
reveal
to
me
by
Mrs.
Clements
of
the
series
of
deception
which
have
bring
Anne
Catherick
to
London
,
and
which
have
there
devote
her
to
the
interest
of
the
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
here
,
again
,
the
Count
have
not
openly
commit
himself
 
here
,
again
,
he
be
,
to
all
practical
purpose
,
out
of
my
reach
.
  
<EOS>
I
next
return
to
Marian
's
journal
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
at
my
request
she
read
to
me
again
a
passage
which
refer
to
her
past
curiosity
about
the
Count
,
and
to
the
few
particular
which
she
have
discover
relate
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
passage
to
which
I
allude
occur
in
that
part
of
her
journal
which
delineate
his
character
and
his
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
describe
him
as
"
not
have
cross
the
frontier
of
his
native
country
for
year
past
"
 
as
"
anxious
to
know
if
any
italian
gentleman
be
settle
in
the
near
town
to
Blackwater
Park
"
 
as
"
receive
letter
with
all
sort
of
odd
stamp
on
them
,
and
one
with
a
large
official
-
look
seal
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
inclined
to
consider
that
his
long
absence
from
his
native
country
may
be
account
for
by
assume
that
he
be
a
political
exile
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
,
on
the
other
hand
,
unable
to
reconcile
this
idea
with
the
reception
of
the
letter
from
abroad
bear
"
the
large
official
-
look
seal
"
 
<EOS>
letter
from
the
continent
address
to
political
exile
be
usually
the
last
to
court
attention
from
foreign
post
-
office
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
the
consideration
thus
present
to
me
in
the
diary
,
join
to
certain
surmise
of
my
own
that
grow
out
of
them
,
suggest
a
conclusion
which
I
wonder
I
have
not
arrive
at
before
.
<EOS>
I
now
say
to
myself
 
<EOS>
what
Laura
have
once
say
to
Marian
at
Blackwater
Park
,
what
Madame
Fosco
have
overhear
by
listen
at
the
door
 
<EOS>
the
Count
be
a
spy
!
  
<EOS>
Laura
have
apply
the
word
to
him
at
hazard
,
in
natural
anger
at
his
proceeding
towards
herself
.
<EOS>
I
apply
it
to
him
with
the
deliberate
conviction
that
his
vocation
in
life
be
the
vocation
of
a
spy
.
<EOS>
on
this
assumption
,
the
reason
for
his
extraordinary
stay
in
England
so
long
after
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
have
be
gain
,
become
,
to
my
mind
,
quite
intelligible
.
  
<EOS>
the
year
of
which
I
be
now
write
be
the
year
of
the
famous
Crystal
Palace
Exhibition
in
Hyde
Park
.
<EOS>
foreigner
in
unusually
large
number
have
arrive
already
,
and
be
still
arrive
in
England
.
<EOS>
man
be
among
us
by
hundred
whom
the
ceaseless
distrustfulness
of
their
government
have
follow
privately
,
by
mean
of
appoint
agent
,
to
our
shore
.
<EOS>
My
surmise
do
not
for
a
moment
class
a
man
of
the
Count
's
ability
and
social
position
with
the
ordinary
rank
and
file
of
foreign
spy
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
him
of
hold
a
position
of
authority
,
of
be
entrust
by
the
government
which
he
secretly
serve
with
the
organisation
and
management
of
agent
specially
employ
in
this
country
,
both
man
and
woman
,
and
I
believe
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
who
have
be
so
opportunely
find
to
act
as
nurse
at
Blackwater
Park
,
to
be
,
in
all
probability
,
one
of
the
number
.
  
<EOS>
assume
that
this
idea
of
mine
have
a
foundation
in
truth
,
the
position
of
the
Count
may
prove
to
be
more
assailable
than
I
have
hitherto
venture
to
hope
.
<EOS>
to
whom
could
I
apply
to
know
something
more
of
the
man
's
history
and
of
the
man
himself
than
I
know
now
?
  
<EOS>
in
this
emergency
it
naturally
occur
to
my
mind
that
a
countryman
of
his
own
,
on
whom
I
could
rely
,
may
be
the
fit
person
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
the
first
man
whom
I
think
of
under
these
circumstance
be
also
the
only
italian
with
whom
I
be
intimately
acquaint
 
my
quaint
little
friend
,
Professor
Pesca
.
  
<EOS>
the
professor
have
be
so
long
absent
from
these
page
that
he
have
run
some
risk
of
be
forget
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
necessary
law
of
such
a
story
as
mine
that
the
person
concern
in
it
only
appear
when
the
course
of
event
take
them
up
 
<EOS>
they
come
and
go
,
not
by
favour
of
my
personal
partiality
,
but
by
right
of
their
direct
connection
with
the
circumstance
to
be
detail
.
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
not
Pesca
alone
,
but
my
mother
and
sister
as
well
,
have
be
leave
far
in
the
background
of
the
narrative
.
<EOS>
My
visit
to
the
Hampstead
cottage
,
my
mother
's
belief
in
the
denial
of
Laura
's
identity
which
the
conspiracy
have
accomplish
,
my
vain
effort
to
overcome
the
prejudice
on
her
part
and
on
my
sister
's
to
which
,
in
their
jealous
affection
for
me
,
they
both
continue
to
adhere
,
the
painful
necessity
which
that
prejudice
impose
on
me
of
conceal
my
marriage
from
them
till
they
have
learn
to
do
justice
to
my
wife
 
all
these
little
domestic
occurrence
have
be
leave
unrecorded
because
they
be
not
essential
to
the
main
interest
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
that
they
add
to
my
anxiety
and
embitter
my
disappointment
 
<EOS>
the
steady
march
of
event
have
inexorably
pass
them
by
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
same
reason
I
have
say
nothing
here
of
the
consolation
that
I
find
in
Pesca
's
brotherly
affection
for
me
,
when
I
see
him
again
after
the
sudden
cessation
of
my
residence
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
record
the
fidelity
with
which
my
warm
-
hearted
little
friend
follow
me
to
the
place
of
embarkation
when
I
sail
for
Central
America
,
or
the
noisy
transport
of
joy
with
which
he
receive
me
when
we
next
meet
in
London
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
feel
justified
in
accept
the
offer
of
service
which
he
make
to
me
on
my
return
,
he
would
have
appear
again
long
ere
this
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
I
know
that
his
honour
and
his
courage
be
to
be
implicitly
rely
on
,
I
be
not
so
sure
that
his
discretion
be
to
be
trust
,
and
,
for
that
reason
only
,
I
follow
the
course
of
all
my
inquiry
alone
.
<EOS>
It
will
now
be
sufficiently
understand
that
Pesca
be
not
separate
from
all
connection
with
me
and
my
interest
,
although
he
have
hitherto
be
separate
from
all
connection
with
the
progress
of
this
narrative
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
true
and
as
ready
<EOS>
a
friend
of
mine
still
as
ever
he
have
be
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
summon
Pesca
to
my
assistance
it
be
necessary
to
see
for
myself
what
sort
of
man
I
have
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
up
to
this
time
I
have
never
once
set
eye
on
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
three
day
after
my
return
with
Laura
and
Marian
to
London
,
I
set
forth
alone
for
Forest
Road
,
St.
John
's
Wood
,
between
ten
and
eleven
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
day
 
<EOS>
I
have
some
hour
to
spare
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
it
likely
,
if
I
wait
a
little
for
him
,
that
the
Count
may
be
tempt
out
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
great
reason
to
fear
the
chance
of
his
recognise
me
in
the
daytime
,
for
the
only
occasion
when
I
have
be
see
by
him
be
the
occasion
on
which
he
have
follow
me
home
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
no
one
appear
at
the
window
in
the
front
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
walk
down
a
turning
which
run
past
the
side
of
it
,
and
look
over
the
low
garden
wall
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
back
window
on
the
low
floor
be
throw
up
and
a
net
be
stretch
across
the
opening
.
<EOS>
I
see
nobody
,
but
I
hear
,
in
the
room
,
first
a
shrill
whistling
and
singing
of
bird
,
then
the
deep
ringing
voice
which
Marian
's
description
have
make
familiar
to
me
.
"
<EOS>

out
on
my
little
finger
,

cry
the

<EOS>
the
Count
be
exercise
his
canary
as
he
use
to
exercise
them
in
Marian
's
time
at
Blackwater
Park
.
  
<EOS>
I
wait
a
little
while
,
and
the
singing
and
the
whistling
cease
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
kiss
me
,
my
prettie
!
"
say
the
deep
voice
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
responsive
twittering
and
chirp
 
a
low
,
oily
laugh
 
a
silence
of
a
minute
or
so
,
and
then
I
hear
the
opening
of
the
house
door
.
<EOS>
I
turn
and
retrace
my
step
.
<EOS>
the
magnificent
melody
of
the
Prayer
in
Rossini
's
Moses
,
sing
in
a
sonorous
bass
voice
,
rise
grandly
through
the
suburban
silence
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
the
front
garden
gate
open
and
close
.
<EOS>
the
Count
have
come
out
.
  
<EOS>
He
cross
the
road
and
walk
towards
the
western
boundary
of
the
Regent
's
Park
.
<EOS>
I
keep
on
my
own
side
of
the
way
,
a
little
behind
him
,
and
walk
in
that
direction
also
.
  
<EOS>
Marian
have
prepare
me
for
his
high
stature
,
his
monstrous
corpulence
,
and
his
ostentatious
mourning
garment
,
but
not
for
the
horrible
freshness
and
cheerfulness
and
vitality
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
carry
his
sixty
year
as
if
they
have
be
few
than
forty
.
<EOS>
He
saunter
along
,
wear
his
hat
a
little
on
one
side
,
with
a
light
jaunty
step
,
swinge
his
big
stick
,
hum
to
himself
,
look
up
from
time
to
time
at
the
house
and
garden
on
either
side
of
him
with
superb
,
smile
patronage
.
<EOS>
if
a
stranger
have
be
tell
that
the
whole
neighbourhood
belong
to
him
,
that
stranger
would
not
have
be
surprised
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
He
never
look
back
,
he
pay
no
apparent
attention
to
me
,
no
apparent
attention
to
any
one
who
pass
him
on
his
own
side
of
the
road
,
except
now
and
then
,
when
he
smile
and
smirk
,
with
an
easy
paternal
good
humour
,
at
the
nursery
-
maid
and
the
child
whom
he
meet
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
he
lead
me
on
,
till
we
reach
a
colony
of
shop
outside
the
western
terrace
of
the
Park
.
  
<EOS>
here
he
stop
at
a
pastrycook
's
,
go
in
(
probably
to
give
an
order
)
,
and
come
out
again
immediately
with
a
tart
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
an
Italian
be
grind
an
organ
before
the
shop
,
and
a
miserable
little
shrivel
monkey
be
sit
on
the
instrument
.
<EOS>
the
Count
stop
,
bite
a
piece
for
himself
out
of
the
tart
,
and
gravely
hand
the
rest
to
the
monkey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
poor
little
man
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
with
grotesque
tenderness
,
"
you
look
hungry
.
<EOS>
in
the
sacred
name
of
humanity
,
I
offer
you
some
lunch
!
"
<EOS>
the
organ
-
grinder
piteously
put
in
his
claim
to
a
penny
from
the
benevolent
stranger
.
<EOS>
the
Count
shrug
his
shoulder
contemptuously
,
and
pass
on
.
  
<EOS>
We
reach
the
street
and
the
well
class
of
shop
between
the
New
Road
and
Oxford
Street
.
<EOS>
the
Count
stop
again
and
enter
a
small
optician
's
shop
,
with
an
inscription
in
the
window
announce
that
repair
be
neatly
execute
inside
.
<EOS>
He
come
out
again
with
an
opera
-
glass
in
his
hand
,
walk
a
few
pace
on
,
and
stop
to
look
at
a
bill
of
the
opera
place
outside
a
music
-
seller
's
shop
.
<EOS>
He
read
the
bill
attentively
,
consider
a
moment
,
and
then
hail
an
empty
cab
as
it
pass
him
.
"
<EOS>
Opera
Box

"
he
say
to
the
man
,
and
be
drive
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
cross
the
road
,
and
look
at
the
bill
in
my
turn
.
<EOS>
the
performance
announce
be
Lucrezia
Borgia
,
and
it
be
to
take
place
that
evening
.
<EOS>
the
opera
-
glass
in
the
Count
's
hand
,
his
careful
reading
of
the
bill
,
and
his
direction
to
the
cabman
,
all
suggest
that
he
propose
make
one
of
the
audience
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
mean
of
get
an
admission
for
myself
and
a
friend
to
the
pit
by
apply
to
one
of
the
scene

painter
attach
to
the
theatre
,
with
whom
I
have
be
well
acquaint
in

<EOS>
there
be
a
chance
at
least
that
the
Count
may
be
easily
visible
among
the
audience
to
me
and
to
any
one
with
me
,
and
in
this
case
I
have
the
mean
of
ascertain
whether
Pesca
know
his
countryman
or
not
that
very
night
.
  
<EOS>
this
consideration
at
once
decide
the
disposal
of
my
evening
.
<EOS>
I
procure
the
ticket
,
leave
a
note
at
the
Professor
's
lodging
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
at
a
quarter
to
eight
I
call
to
take
him
with
me
to
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
My
little
friend
be
in
a
state
of
the
high
excitement
,
with
a
festive
flower
in
his
button
-
hole
,
and
the
large
opera
-
glass
I
ever
see
hug
up
under
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
ready
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
right
-
all
-
right
,
"
say
Pesca
.
  
<EOS>
We
start
for
the
theatre
.
    
<EOS>
the
last
note
of
the
introduction
to
the
opera
be
be
play
,
and
the
seat
in
the
pit
be
all
fill
,
when
Pesca
and
I
reach
the
theatre
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
room
,
however
,
in
the
passage
that
run
round
the
pit
 
precisely
the
position
best
calculate
to
answer
the
purpose
for
which
I
be
attend
the
performance
.
<EOS>
I
go
first
to
the
barrier
separate
us
from
the
stall
,
and
look
for
the
Count
in
that
part
of
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
return
along
the
passage
,
on
the
left
-
hand
side
from
the
stage
,
and
look
about
me
attentively
,
I
discover
him
in
the
pit
.
<EOS>
He
occupy
an
excellent
place
,
some
twelve
or
fourteen
seat
from
the
end
of
a
bench
,
within
three
row
of
the
stall
.
<EOS>
I
place
myself
exactly
on
a
line
with
him
.
<EOS>
pesca
stand
by
my
side
.
<EOS>
the
Professor
be
not
yet
aware
of
the
purpose
for
which
I
have
bring
him
to
the
theatre
,
and
he
be
rather
surprised
that
we
do
not
move
nearer
to
the
stage
.
  
<EOS>
the
curtain
rise
,
and
the
opera
begin
.
  
<EOS>
throughout
the
whole
of
the
first
act
we
remain
in
our
position
 
the
Count
,
absorb
by
the
orchestra
and
the
stage
,
never
cast
so
much
as
a
chance
glance
at
us
.
<EOS>
not
a
note
of
Donizetti
's
delicious
music
be
lose
on
him
.
<EOS>
there
he
sit
,
high
above
his
neighbour
,
smile
,
and
nod
his
great
head
enjoyingly
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
when
the
people
near
him
applaud
the
close
of
an
air
(
as
an
english
audience
in
such
circumstance
always
WILL
applaud
)
,
without
the
least
consideration
for
the
orchestral
movement
which
immediately
follow
it
,
he
look
round
at
them
with
an
expression
of
compassionate
remonstrance
,
and
hold
up
one
hand
with
a
gesture
of
polite
entreaty
.
<EOS>
at
the
more
refined
passage
of
the
singing
,
at
the
more
delicate
phase
of
the
music
,
which
pass
unapplaude
by
other
,
his
fat
hand
,
adorn
with
perfectly
-
fit
black
kid
glove
,
softly
pat
each
other
,
in
token
of
the
cultivate
appreciation
of
a
musical
man
.
<EOS>
at
such
time
,
his
oily
murmur
of
approval
,
"
Bravo
!
<EOS>
bra
-
a
-
a
-
a
!
"
<EOS>
hum
through
the
silence
,
like
the
purring
of
a
great
cat
.
<EOS>
His
immediate
neighbour
on
either
side
 
hearty
,
ruddy
-
face
people
from
the
country
,
bask
amazedly
in
the
sunshine
of
fashionable
London
 
see
and
hear
him
,
begin
to
follow
his
lead
.
<EOS>
many
a
burst
of
applause
from
the
pit
that
night
start
from
the
soft
,
comfortable
patting
of
the
black
-
gloved
hand
.
<EOS>
the
man
's
voracious
vanity
devour
this
imply
tribute
to
his
local
and
critical
supremacy
with
an
appearance
of
the
high
relish
.
<EOS>
smile
ripple
continuously
over
his
fat
face
.
<EOS>
He
look
about
him
,
at
the
pause
in
the
music
,
serenely
satisfied
with
himself
and
his
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
these
barbarous
english
people
be
learn
something
from
me
.
<EOS>
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
,
I
 
Fosco
 
be
an
influence
that
be
feel
,
a
man
who
sit
supreme
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
ever
face
speak
,
his
face
speak
then
,
and
that
be
its
language
.
  
<EOS>
the
curtain
fall
on
the
first
act
,
and
the
audience
rise
to
look
about
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
time
I
have
wait
for
 
the
time
to
try
if
Pesca
know
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
rise
with
the
rest
,
and
survey
the
occupant
of
the
box
grandly
with
his
opera
-
glass
.
<EOS>
at
first
his
back
be
towards
us
,
but
he
turn
round
in
time
,
to
our
side
of
the
theatre
,
and
look
at
the
box
above
us
,
use
his
glass
for
a
few
minute
 
then
remove
it
,
but
still
continue
to
look
up
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
moment
I
choose
,
when
his
full
face
be
in
view
,
for
direct
Pesca
's
attention
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
that
man
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
which
man
,
my
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
tall
,
fat
man
,
stand
there
,
with
his
face
towards
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Pesca
raise
himself
on
tiptoe
,
and
look
at
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
Professor
.
<EOS>
"
the
big
fat
man
be
a
stranger
to
me
.
<EOS>
be
he
famous
?
<EOS>
why
do
you
point
him
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
have
particular
reason
for
wish
to
know
something
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
countryman
of
your
 
<EOS>
his
name
be
Count
Fosco
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
that
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
I
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
neither
the
name
nor
the
man
be
know
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
quite
sure
you
do
not
recognise
him
?
<EOS>
look
again
 
look
carefully
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
why
I
be
so
anxious
about
it
when
we
leave
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
stop
!
<EOS>
let
me
help
you
up
here
,
where
you
can
see
him
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
help
the
little
man
to
perch
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
raise
dai
upon
which
the
pit
-
seat
be
all
place
.
<EOS>
His
small
stature
be
no
hindrance
to
him
 
<EOS>
here
he
could
see
over
the
head
of
the
lady
who
be
seat
near
the
outermost
part
of
the
bench
.
  
<EOS>
a
slim
,
light
-
haired
man
stand
by
us
,
whom
I
have
not
notice
before
 
a
man
with
a
scar
on
his
left
cheek
 
look
attentively
at
Pesca
as
I
help
him
up
,
and
then
look
still
more
attentively
,
follow
the
direction
of
Pesca
's
eye
,
at
the
Count
.
<EOS>
Our
conversation
may
have
reach
his
ear
,
and
may
,
as
it
strike
me
,
have
rouse
his
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Pesca
fix
his
eye
earnestly
on
the
broad
,
full
,
smile
face
<EOS>
turn
a
little
upward
,
exactly
opposite
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
have
never
set
my
two
eye
on
that
big
fat
man
before
in
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
he
speak
the
Count
look
downwards
towards
the
box
behind
us
on
the
pit
tier
.
  
<EOS>
the
eye
of
the
two
Italians
meet
.
  
<EOS>
the
instant
before
I
have
be
perfectly
satisfy
,
from
his
own
reiterated
assertion
,
that
Pesca
do
not
know
the
Count
.
<EOS>
the
instant
afterwards
I
be
equally
certain
that
the
Count
know
Pesca
!
  
<EOS>
know
him
,
and
 
more
surprising
still
 
fear
him
as
well
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
mistake
the
change
that
pass
over
the
villain
's
face
.
<EOS>
the
leaden
hue
that
alter
his
yellow
complexion
in
a
moment
,
the
sudden
rigidity
of
all
his
feature
,
the
furtive
scrutiny
of
his
cold
grey
eye
,
the
motionless
stillness
of
him
from
head
to
foot
tell
their
own
tale
.
<EOS>
a
mortal
dread
have
master
him
body
and
soul
 
and
his
own
recognition
of
Pesca
be
the
cause
of
it
!
  
<EOS>
the
slim
man
with
the
scar
on
his
cheek
be
still
close
by
us
.
<EOS>
He
have
apparently
draw
his
inference
from
the
effect
produce
on
the
Count
by
the
sight
of
Pesca
as
I
have
draw
mine
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
mild
,
gentlemanlike
man
,
look
like
a
foreigner
,
and
his
interest
in
our
proceeding
be
not
express
in
anything
approach
to
an
offensive
manner
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
I
be
so
startle
by
the
change
in
the
Count
's
face
,
so
astounded
at
the
entirely
unexpected
turn
which
event
have
take
,
that
I
know
neither
what
to
say
or
do
next
.
<EOS>
Pesca
rouse
me
by
step
back
to
his
former
place
at
my
side
and
speak
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
the
fat
man
stare
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
be
it
at
me
?
<EOS>
be
I
famous
?
<EOS>
how
can
he
know
me
when
I
do
not
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
keep
my
eye
still
on
the
Count
.
<EOS>
I
see
him
move
for
the
first
time
when
Pesca
move
,
so
as
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
little
man
in
the
low
position
in
which
he
now
stand
.
<EOS>
I
be
curious
to
see
what
would
happen
if
Pesca
's
attention
under
these
circumstance
be
withdraw
from
him
,
and
I
accordingly
ask
the
Professor
if
he
recognise
any
of
his
pupil
that
evening
among
the
lady
in
the
box
.
<EOS>
Pesca
immediately
raise
the
large
opera
-
glass
to
his
eye
,
and
move
it
slowly
all
round
the
upper
part
of
the
theatre
,
search
for
his
pupil
with
the
most
conscientious
scrutiny
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
he
show
himself
to
be
thus
engage
the
Count
turn
round
,
slip
past
the
person
who
occupy
seat
on
the
farther
side
of
him
from
where
we
stand
,
and
disappear
in
the
middle
passage
down
the
centre
of
the
pit
.
<EOS>
I
catch
Pesca
by
the
arm
,
and
to
his
inexpressible
astonishment
,
hurry
him
round
with
me
to
the
back
of
the
pit
to
intercept
the
Count
before
he
could
get
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
somewhat
to
my
surprise
,
the
slim
man
hasten
out
before
us
,
avoid
a
stoppage
cause
by
some
people
on
our
side
of
the
pit
leave
their
place
,
by
which
Pesca
and
myself
be
delay
.
<EOS>
when
we
reach
the
lobby
the
Count
have
disappear
,
and
the
foreigner
with
the
scar
be
go
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
home
,
"
<EOS>
I
say
;
"
come
home
,
Pesca
to
your
lodging
.
<EOS>
I
must
speak
to
you
in
private
 
<EOS>
I
must
speak
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
-
soul
-
bless
-
my
-
soul
!
"
cry
the
Professor
,
in
a
state
of
the
extremest
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
"
what
on
earth
be
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
walk
on
rapidly
without
answer
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
under
which
the
Count
have
leave
the
theatre
suggest
to
me
that
his
extraordinary
anxiety
to
escape
Pesca
may
carry
him
to
further
extremity
still
.
<EOS>
He
may
escape
me
,
too
,
by
leave
London
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
the
future
if
I
allow
him
so
much
as
a
day
's
freedom
to
act
as
he
please
.
<EOS>
and
I
doubt
that
foreign
stranger
,
who
have
get
the
start
of
us
,
and
whom
I
suspect
of
intentionally
follow
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
double
distrust
in
my
mind
,
I
be
not
long
in
make
Pesca
understand
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
two
be
alone
in
his
room
,
I
increase
his
confusion
and
amazement
a
hundredfold
by
tell
him
what
my
purpose
be
as
plainly
and
unreservedly
as
I
have
acknowledge
it
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
what
can
I
do
?
"
cry
the
Professor
,
piteously
appeal
to
me
with
both
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
deuce
-
what
-
the
-
deuce
!
<EOS>
how
can
I
help
you
,
Walter
,
when
I
do
not
know
the
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
he
know
you
 
<EOS>
he
be
afraid
of
you
 
<EOS>
he
have
leave
the
theatre
to
escape
you
.
<EOS>
pesca
!
<EOS>
there
must
be
a
reason
for
this
.
<EOS>
look
back
into
your
own
life
before
you
come
to
England
.
<EOS>
You
leave
Italy
,
as
you
have
tell
me
yourself
,
for
political
reason
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
mention
those
reason
to
me
,
and
I
do
not
inquire
into
them
now
.
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
to
consult
your
own
recollection
,
and
to
say
if
they
suggest
<EOS>
no
past
cause
for
the
terror
which
the
first
sight
of
you
produce
in
that
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
my
unutterable
surprise
,
these
word
,
harmless
as
they
appear
to
me
,
produce
the
same
astounding
effect
on
Pesca
which
the
sight
of
Pesca
have
produce
on
the
Count
.
<EOS>
the
rosy
face
of
my
little
friend
whiten
in
an
instant
,
and
he
draw
back
from
me
slowly
,
tremble
from
head
to
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
what
you
ask
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
speak
in
a
whisper
 
<EOS>
he
look
at
me
as
if
I
have
suddenly
reveal
to
him
some
hidden
danger
to
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
one
minute
of
time
he
be
so
altered
from
the
easy
,
lively
,
quaint
little
man
of
all
my
past
experience
,
that
if
I
have
meet
him
in
the
street
,
change
as
I
see
him
now
,
I
should
most
certainly
not
have
know
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
forgive
me
,
if
I
have
unintentionally
pain
and
shock
you
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
remember
the
cruel
wrong
my
wife
have
suffer
at
Count
Fosco
's
hand
.
<EOS>
remember
that
the
wrong
can
never
be
redress
,
unless
the
mean
be
in
my
power
of
force
him
to
do
her
justice
.
<EOS>
I
speak
in
HER
interest
,
Pesca
 
I
ask
you
again
to
forgive
me
 
I
can
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rise
to
go
.
<EOS>
He
stop
me
before
I
reach
the

walk
up

down
the

talk
to
himself
incoherently
in
his
own
language

<EOS>
after
several
turn
backwards
and
forwards
,
he
suddenly
come
up
to
me
,
and
lay
his
little
hand
with
a
strange
tenderness
and
solemnity
on
my
breast
.

"
on
your

again

open
the

look
out
cautiously
into

close
it
once
more

come

"
You

true

put
my

<EOS>
the
tremble
earnestness
with
which
he
utter
this
extraordinary
warning
,
carry
with
it
,
to
my
mind
,
the
conviction
that
he
speak
the
truth

this

go
on

<EOS>
He
say
a
few
word
more
,
hesitatingly
and
disconnectedly
,
then
stop
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
that
the
effort
of
express
himself
in
English
,
on
an
occasion
too
serious
to
permit
him
the
use
of
the
quaint
turn
and
phrase
of
his
ordinary
vocabulary
,
be
painfully
increase
the
difficulty
he
have
feel
from
the
first
in
speak
to
me
at
all
.
<EOS>
have
learn
to
read
and
understand
his
native
language
(
though
not
to
speak
it
)
,
in
the
early
day
of
our
intimate
companionship
,
I
now
suggest
to
him
that
he
should
express
himself
in
Italian
,
while
I
use
English
in
put
any
question
which
may
be
necessary
to
my
enlightenment
.
<EOS>
He
accept
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
in
his
smooth
-
flow
language
,
speak
with
a
vehement
agitation
which
betray
itself
in
the
perpetual
working
of
his
feature
,
in
the
wildness
and
the
suddenness
of
his
foreign
gesticulation
,
but
never
in
the
raising
of
his
voice
,
I
now
hear
the
word
which
arm
me
to
meet
the
last
struggle
,
that
be
leave
for
this
story
to
record.[3

It
be
only
right
to
mention
here
,
that
I
repeat
Pesco
's
statement
to
me
with
the
careful
suppression
and
alteration
which
the
serious
nature
of
the
subject
and
my
own
sense
of
duty
to
my
friend
demand
.
<EOS>
My
first

so
as
not
to
disturb
him
,
and
speak
my
few
parting
word
in
low
tone
,
which
he
may
hear
or
not

as
he
please

<EOS>
"
I
will
keep
the
memory
of
to

night
in
my
heart
of
heart

I
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
never
repent
the
trust
you
have
repose
in
me

<EOS>
May
I
come
to
you
to

morrow
?
<EOS>
May
I
come
as
early
as
nine
o'clock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Walter
,
"
he
reply
,
look
up
at
me
kindly
,
and
speak
in
English
once
more
,
as
if
his
one
anxiety
now
be
to
get
back
to
our
former
relation
towards
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
come
to
my
little
bit
of
breakfast
before
I
go
my
way
among
the
pupil
that
I
teach
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
good

night

Pesca

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
night

my
friend

"
    
my
first
conviction
as
soon
as
I
find
myself
outside
the
house
,
be
that
no
alternative
be
leave
me
but
to
act
at
once
on
the
information
I
have
receive
 
to
make
sure
of
the
Count
that
night
,
or
to
risk
the
loss
,
if
I
only
delay
till
the
morning
,
of
Laura
's
last
chance
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
my
watch
 
<EOS>
it
be
ten
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
cross
my
mind
of
the
purpose
for
which
the
Count
have
leave
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
His
escape
from
us
,
that
evening
,
be
beyond
all
question
the
preliminary
only
to
his
escape
from
London
.
<EOS>
the
mark
of
the
Brotherhood
be
on
his
arm
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
certain
of
it
as
if
he
have
show
me
the
brand
;
and
the
betrayal
of
the
Brotherhood
be
on
his
conscience
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
it
in
his
recognition
of
Pesca
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
understand
why
that
recognition
have
not
be
mutual
.
<EOS>
a
man
of
the
Count
's
character
would
never
risk
the
terrible
consequence
of
turn
spy
without
look
to
his
personal
security
quite
as
carefully
as
he
look
to
his
golden
reward
.
<EOS>
the
shaven
face
,
which
I
have
point
out
at
the
Opera
,
may
have
be
cover
by
a
beard
in
Pesca
's
time
 
his
dark
brown
hair
may
be
a
wig
 
<EOS>
his
name
be
evidently
a
false
one
.
<EOS>
the
accident
of
time
may
have
help
him
as
well
 
his
immense
corpulence
may
have
come
with
his
later
year
.
<EOS>
there
be
every
reason
why
Pesca
should
not
have
know
him
again
 
every
reason
also
why
he
should
have
know
Pesca
,
<EOS>
whose
singular
personal
appearance
make
a
marked
man
of
him
,
go
where
he
may
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
I
feel
certain
of
the
purpose
in
the
Count
's
mind
when
he
escape
us
at
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
how
could
I
doubt
it
,
when
I
see
,
with
my
own
eye
,
that
he
believe
himself
,
in
spite
of
the
change
in
his
appearance
,
to
have
be
recognise
by
Pesca
,
and
to
be
therefore
in
danger
of
his
life
?
<EOS>
if
I
could
get
speech
of
him
that
night
,
if
I
could
show
him
that
I
,
too
know
of
the
mortal
peril
in
which
he
stand
,
what
result
would
follow
?
<EOS>
plainly
this
.
<EOS>
one
of
us
must
be
master
of
the
situation
 
<EOS>
one
of
us
must
inevitably
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
owe
it
to
myself
to
consider
the
chance
against
me
before
I
confront
them
.
<EOS>
I
owe
it
to
my
wife
to
do
all
that
lie
in
my
power
to
lessen
the
risk
.
  
<EOS>
the
chance
against
me
want
no
reckon
up
 
<EOS>
they
be
all
merge
in
one
.
<EOS>
if
the
Count
discover
,
by
my
own
avowal
,
that
the
direct
way
to
his
safety
lie
through
my
life
,
he
be
probably
the
last
man
in
existence
who
would
shrink
from
throw
me
off
my
guard
and
take
that
way
,
when
he
have
me
alone
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
the
only
mean
of
defence
against
him
on
which
I
could
at
all
rely
to
lessen
the
risk
,
present
themselves
,
after
a
little
careful
thinking
,
clearly
enough
.
<EOS>
before
I
make
any
personal
acknowledgment
of
my
discovery
in
his
presence
,
I
must
place
the
discovery
itself
where
it
would
be
ready
for
instant
use
against
him
,
and
safe
from
any
attempt
at
suppression
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
if
I
lay
the
mine
under
his
foot
before
I
approach
him
,
and
if
I
leave
instruction
with
a
third
person
to
fire
it
on
the
expiration
of
a
certain
time
,
unless
direction
to
the
contrary
be
previously
receive
under
my
own
hand
,
or
from
my
own
lip
 
in
that
event
the
Count
's
security
be
absolutely
dependent
upon
mine
,
and
I
may
hold
the
vantage
ground
over
him
securely
,
even
in
his
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
this
idea
occur
to
me
when
I
be
close
to
the
new
lodging
which
we
have
take
on
return
from
the
sea
-
side
.
<EOS>
I
go
in
without
disturb
any
one
,
by
the
help
of
my
key
.
<EOS>
a
light
be
in
the
hall
,
and
I
steal
up
with
it
to
my
workroom
to
make
my
preparation
,
and
absolutely
to
commit
myself
to
an
interview
with
the
Count
,
before
either
Laura
or
Marian
could
have
the
slight
suspicion
of
what
I
intend
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
a
letter
address
to
Pesca
represent
the
sure
measure
of
precaution
which
it
be
now
possible
for
me
to
take
.
<EOS>
I
write
as
follow
    
"
<EOS>
the

I

my

<EOS>
I

enclose

in
an

it
up

<EOS>
on

I
add
my
initial
,
and
protect
the
whole

it
in
a
second
sealed
envelope
,
address
to
Pesca
at

<EOS>
nothing
remain
to
be
do
after
this
but
to
find
the
mean
of
send
my
letter
to
its
destination
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
should
then
have
accomplish
all
that
lie
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
if
anything
happen
to
me
in
the
Count
's
house

I
have
now
provide
for
his

it
with

be
at
Pesca
's
disposal
,
if
he
choose
to
exert
them
,
I
do
not
for
an
instant
doubt
.
<EOS>
the
extraordinary
anxiety
which
he
have
express
to
remain
unenlightened
as
to
the
Count
's
identity
 
or
,
in
other
word
,
to
be
leave
uncertain
enough
about
fact
to
justify
him
to
his
own
conscience
in
remain
passive
 
betray
plainly
that
the
mean
of
exercise
the
terrible
justice
of
the
Brotherhood
be
ready
to
his
hand
,
although
,
as
a
naturally
humane
man
,
he
have
shrink
from
plainly
say
as
much
in
my
presence
.
<EOS>
the
deadly
certainty
with
which
the
vengeance
of
foreign
political
society
can
hunt
down
a
traitor
to
the
cause
,
hide
himself
where
he
may
,
have
be
too
often
exemplified
,
even
in
my
superficial
experience
,
to
allow
of
any
doubt
.
<EOS>
consider
the
subject
only
as
a
reader
of
newspaper
,
case
recur
to
my
memory
,
both
in
London
and
in
Paris
,
of
foreigner
find
stab
in
the
street

whose
assassin
could
never

throw
into

by

by
secret
violence
which
could

account
for
in

way

<EOS>
I
have
disguise
nothing
relate
to
myself
in
these
page

and
I
do
not
disguise
here
that
I
believe
I
have
write
Count
Fosco
's
death
-
warrant
,
if
the
fatal
emergency
happen
which
authorise
Pesca
to
open
my
enclosure
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
my
room
to
go
down
to
the
ground
floor
of
the
house
,
and
speak
to
the
landlord
about
find
me
a
messenger
.
<EOS>
He
happen
to
be
ascend
the
stair
at
the
time
,
and
we
meet
on
the
landing
.
<EOS>
His
son
,
a
quick
lad
,
be
the
messenger
he
propose
to
me
on
hear
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
We
have
the
boy
upstairs
,
and
I
give
him
his
direction
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
take
the
letter
in
a
cab
,
to
put
it
into
Professor
Pesca
's
own
hand
,
and
to
bring
me
back
a
line
of
acknowledgment
from
that
gentleman
 
return
in
the
cab
,
and
keep
it
at
the
door
for
my
use
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
nearly
half
-
past
ten
.
<EOS>
I
calculate
that
the
boy
may
be
back
in
twenty
minute
,
and
that
I
may
drive
to
St.
John
's
Wood
,
on
his
return
,
in
twenty
minute
more
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
lad
have
depart
on
his
errand
<EOS>
I
return
to
my
own
room
for
a
little
while
,
to
put
certain
paper
in
order
,
so
that
they
may
be
easily
find
in
case
of
the
bad
.
<EOS>
the
key
of
the
old

fashioned
bureau
in

the
paper
be
keep
I
seal
up
,
and
leave
it
on
my
table
,
with
Marian
's
name
write
on
the
outside
of
the
little
packet
.
<EOS>
this
do
,
I
go
downstairs
to
the
sitting
-
room
,
in
which
I
expect
to
find
Laura
and
Marian
await
my
return
from
the
Opera
.
<EOS>
I
feel
my
hand
tremble
for
the
first
time
when
I
lay
it
on
the
lock
of

<EOS>
no

She

<EOS>
I
leave
the
room
again
on
the
pretext
of
wish
to
see
whether
Laura
be
asleep

<EOS>
Marian
's
quick
eye
be
begin
to
look
inquiringly
at
my
face
 
Marian
's
quick
instinct
be
begin
to
discover
that
I
have
something
weigh
on
my
mind

<EOS>
when
I
enter
the
bedchamber
,
and
softly
approach
the
bedside
by
the
dim
flicker
of
the
night

lamp

my

asleep

<EOS>
We
have
not

quite
a
month
yet

<EOS>
if
my
heart
be
heavy

if
my
resolution
for
a
moment
falter
again
,
when
I
look
at

face
turn
faithfully
to
my
pillow
in
her
sleep
 
when
I
see
her
hand
rest
open
on
the
coverlid
,
as
if
it
be
wait
unconsciously
for
mine
 
surely
there
be
some
excuse
for
me
?
<EOS>
I
only
allow
myself
a
few
minute
to
kneel
down
at
the
bedside
,
and
to
look
close
at
her
 
so
close
that
her
breath
,
as
it
come
and
go
,
flutter
on
my
face

<EOS>
I
only
touch
her
hand
and
her
cheek
with
my
lip
at
parting
.
<EOS>
She
stir
in
her
sleep
and
murmur
my
name
,
but
without
wake
.
<EOS>
I
linger
for
an
instant
at
the
door
to
look
at
her
again

look
into

night
.
<EOS>
only
let
me
go
away
with
my
mind
easy
about
Laura
,
and
I
answer
for
everything
else
.
<EOS>
come
,
Marian
,
give
me
a
kiss
,
and
show
that
you
have
the
courage
to
wait
till
I
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
dare
not
allow
her
time
to
say
a
word
more
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
hold
me
again
.
<EOS>
I
unclasp
her
hand
,
and
be
out
of
the
room
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
the
boy
below
hear
me
on
the
stair
,
and
open
the
hall
-
door
.
<EOS>
I
jump
into
the
cab
before
the
driver
could
get
off
the
box
.
"
<EOS>
Forest
Road
,
St.
John
's
Wood
,
"
<EOS>
I
call
to
him
through
the
front
window
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
double
fare
if
you
get
there
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
I
look
at
my
watch
.
<EOS>
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
not
a
minute
to
lose
.
  
<EOS>
the
rapid
motion
of
the
cab
,
the
sense
that
every
instant
now
be
bring
me
nearer
to
the
Count
,
the
conviction
that
I
be
embark
at
last
,
without
let
or
hindrance
,
on
my
hazardous
enterprise
,
heat
me
into
such
a
fever
of
excitement
that
I
shout
to
the
man
to
go
faster
and
faster
.
<EOS>
as
we
leave
the
street
,
and
cross
St.
John
's
Wood
Road
,
my
impatience
so
completely
overpower
me
that
I
stand
up
in
the
cab
and
stretch
my
head
out
of
the
window
,
to
see
the
end
of
the
journey
before
we
reach
it
.
<EOS>
just
as
a
church
clock
in
the
distance
strike
the
quarter
past
,
we
turn
into
the
Forest
Road
.
<EOS>
I
stop
the
driver
a
little
away
from
the
Count
's
house
,
pay
and
dismiss
him
,
and
walk
on
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
approach
the
garden
gate
,
I
see
another
person
advance
towards
it
also
from
the
direction
opposite
to
mine
.
<EOS>
We
meet
under
the
gas
lamp
in
the
road
,
and
look
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
recognise
the
light
-
haired
foreigner
with
the
scar
on
his
cheek
,
and
I
think
he
recognise
me
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
,
and
instead
of
stop
at
the
house
,
as
I
do
,
he
slowly
walk
on
.
<EOS>
be
he
in
the
Forest
Road
by
accident
?
<EOS>
or
have
he
follow
the
Count
home
from
the
Opera
?
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
pursue
those
question
.
<EOS>
after
wait
a
little
till
the
foreigner
have
slowly
pass
out
of
sight
,
I
ring
the
gate
bell
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
twenty
minute
past
eleven
 
late
enough
to
make
it
quite
easy
for
the
Count
to
get
rid
of
me
by
the
excuse
that
he
be
in
bed
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
way
of
provide
against
this
contingency
be
to
send
in
my
name
without
ask
any
preliminary
question
,
and
to
let
him
know
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
have
a
serious
motive
for
wish
to
see
him
at
that
late
hour
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
while
I
be
wait
,
I
take
out
my
card
and
write
under
my
name
"
on
important
business
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
maid
-
servant
answer
the
door
while
I
be
write
the
last
word
in
pencil
,
and
ask
me
distrustfully
what
I
"
please
to
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
so
good
as
to
take
that
to
your
master
,
"
I
reply
,
give
her
the
card
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
,
by
the
girl
's
hesitation
of
manner
,
that
if
I
have
ask
for
the
Count
in
the
first
instance
she
would
only
have
follow
her
instruction
by
tell
me
he
be
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
She
be
stagger
by
the
confidence
with
which
I
give
her
the
card
.
<EOS>
after
stare
at
me
,
in
great
perturbation
,
she
go
back
into
the
house
with
my
message
,
close
the
door
,
and
leave
me
to
wait
in
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
minute
<EOS>
or
so
she
reappear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
master
's
compliment
,
and
would
I
be
so
obliging
as
to
say
what
my
business
be
?
"
<EOS>
"
take
my
compliment
back
,
"
I
reply
,
"
and
say
that
the
business
can
not
be
mention
to
any
one
but
your
master
.
"
<EOS>
She
leave
me
again
,
again
return
,
and
this
time
ask
me
to
walk
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
follow
her
at
once
.
<EOS>
in
another
moment
I
be
inside
the
Count
's
house
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
no
lamp
in
the
hall
,
but
by
the
dim
light
of
the
kitchen
candle
,
which
the
girl
have
bring
upstairs
with
her
,
I
see
an
elderly
lady
steal
noiselessly
out
of
a
back
room
on
the
ground
floor
.
<EOS>
She
cast
one
viperish
look
at
me
as
I
enter
the
hall
,
but
say
nothing
,
and
go
slowly
upstairs
without
return
my
bow
.
<EOS>
My
familiarity
with
Marian
's
journal
sufficiently
assure
me
that
the
elderly
lady
be
Madame
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
the
servant
lead
me
to
the
room
which
the
Countess
have
just
leave
.
<EOS>
I
enter
it
,
and
find
myself
face
to
face
with
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
still
in
his
evening
dress
,
except
his
coat
,
which
he
have
throw
across
a
chair
.
<EOS>
His
shirt
-
sleeve
be
turn
up
at
the
wrist
,
but
no
high
.
<EOS>
a
carpet
-
bag
be
on
one
side
of
him
,
and
a
box
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
book
,
paper
,
and
article
of
wear
apparel
be
scatter
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
on
a
table
,
at
one
side
of
the
door
,
stand
the
cage
,
so
well
known
to
me
by
description
,
which
contain
his
white
mouse
.
<EOS>
the
canary
and
the
cockatoo
be
probably
in
some
other
room
.
<EOS>
He
be
seat
before
the
box
,
pack
it
,
when
I
go
in
,
and
rise
with
some
paper
in
his
hand
to
receive
me
.
<EOS>
His
face
still
betray
plain
trace
of
the
shock
that
have
overwhelm
him
at
the
Opera
.
<EOS>
His
fat
cheek
hang
loose
,
his
cold
grey
eye
be
furtively
vigilant
,
his
voice
,
look
,
and
manner
be
all
sharply
suspicious
alike
,
as
he
advance
a
step
to
meet
me
,
and
request
,
with
distant
civility
,
that
I
would
take
a
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
come
here
on
business
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
at
a
loss
to
know
what
that
business
can
possibly
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
unconcealed
curiosity
,
with
which
he
look
hard
in
my
face
while
he
speak
,
convince
me
that
I
have
pass
unnoticed
by
him
at
the
Opera
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
Pesca
first
,
and
from
that
moment
till
he
leave
the
theatre
he
have
evidently
see
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
My
name
would
necessarily
suggest
to
him
that
I
have
not
come
into
his
house
with
other
than
a
hostile
purpose
towards
himself
,
but
he
appear
to
be
utterly
ignorant
thus
far
of
the
real
nature
of
my
errand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
fortunate
in
find
you
here
to
-
night
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
be
on
the
point
of
take
a
journey
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
your
business
connect
with
my
journey
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
some
degree
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
in
what
degree
?
<EOS>
do
you
know
where
I
be
go
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
why
you
be
leave
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
slip
by
me
with
the
quickness
of
thought
,
lock
the
door
,
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
and
I
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
be
excellently
well
acquaint
with
one
another
by
reputation
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
do
it
,
by
any
chance
,
occur
to
you
when
you
come
to
this
house
that
I
be
not
the
sort
of
man
you
could
trifle
with
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
do
occur
to
me
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
have
not
come
to
trifle
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
here
on
a
matter
of
life
and
death
,
and
if
that
door
which
you
have
lock
be
open
at
this
moment
,
nothing
you
could
say
or
do
would
induce
me
to
pass
through
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
walk
farther
into
the
room
,
and
stand
opposite
to
him
on
the
rug
before
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
He
draw
a
chair
in
front
of
the
door
,
and
sit
down
on
it
,
with
his
left
arm
rest
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
the
cage
with
the
white
mouse
be
close
to
him
,
and
the
little
creature
scamper
out
of
their
sleeping
-
place
as
his
heavy
arm
shake
the
table
,
and
peer
at
him
through
the
gap
in
the
smartly
paint
wire
.
  
<EOS>
"
on
a
matter
of
life
and
death
,
"
he
repeat
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
those
word
be
more
serious
,
perhaps
,
than
you
think
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
perspiration
break
out
thickly
on
his
broad
forehead
.
<EOS>
His
left
hand
stole
over
the
edge
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
drawer
in
it
,
with
a
lock
,
and
the
key
be
in
the
lock
.
<EOS>
His
finger
and
thumb
close
over
the
key
,
but
do
not
turn
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
you
know
why
I
be
leave
London
?
<EOS>
"
he
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
tell
me
the
reason
,
if
you
please
.
"
<EOS>
He
turn
the
key
,
and
unlock
the
drawer
as
he
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
better
than
that
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
show
you
the
reason
,
if
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
show
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
get
your
coat
off
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
roll
up
the
shirt
-
sleeve
on
your
left
arm
,
and
you
will
see
it
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
same
livid
leaden
change
pass
over
his
face
which
I
have
see
pass
over
it
at
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
the
deadly
glitter
in
his
eye
shine
steady
and
straight
into
mine
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
his
left
hand
slowly
open
the
table
-
drawer
,
and
softly
slip
into
it
.
<EOS>
the
harsh
grating
noise
of
something
heavy
that
he
be
move
unseen
to
me
sound
for
a
moment
,
then
cease
.
<EOS>
the
silence
that
follow
be
so
intense
that
the
faint
ticking
nibble
of
the
white
mouse
at
their
wire
be
distinctly
audible
where
I
stand
.
  
<EOS>
My
life
hang
by
a
thread
,
and
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
at
that
final
moment
I
think
with
his
mind
,
I
feel
with
his
finger
 
<EOS>
I
be
as
certain
as
if
I
have
see
it
of
what
he
keep
hide
from
me
in
the
drawer
.
  
<EOS>
"
wait
a
little
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
get
the
door
lock
 
<EOS>
you
see
I
do
not
move
 
<EOS>
you
see
my
hand
be
empty
.
<EOS>
wait
a
little
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
have
say
enough
,
"
he
reply
,
with
a
sudden
composure
so
unnatural
and
so
ghastly
that
it
try
my
nerve
as
no
outbreak
of
violence
could
have
try
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
one
moment
for
my
own
thought
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
do
you
guess
what
I
be
think
about
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
think
,
"
he
remark
quietly
,
"
whether
I
shall
add
to
the
disorder
in
this
room
by
scatter
your
brain
about
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
move
at
that
moment
,
I
see
in
his
face
that
he
would
have
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
advise
you
to
read
two
line
of
writing
which
I
have
about
me
,
"
I
rejoin
,
"
before
you
finally
decide
that
question
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
proposal
appear
to
excite
his
curiosity
.
<EOS>
He
nod
his
head
.
<EOS>
I
take
Pesca
's
acknowledgment
of
the
receipt
of
my
letter
out
of
my
pocket
-
book
,
hand
it
to
him
at
arm
's
length
,
and
return
to
my
former
position
in
front
of
the
fireplace
.
  
<EOS>
He
read
the
line
aloud
:
"
Your
letter
be
receive
.
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
hear
from
you
before
the
time
you
mention
,
I
will
break
the
seal
when
the
clock
strike
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
another
man
in
his
position
would
have
need
some
explanation
of
those
word
 
the
Count
feel
no
such
necessity
.
<EOS>
one
reading
of
the
note
show
him
the
precaution
that
I
have
take
as
plainly
as
if
he
have
be
present
at
the
time
when
I
adopt
it
.
<EOS>
the
expression
of
his
face
change
on
the
instant
,
and
his
hand
come
out
of
the
drawer
empty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
lock
up
my
drawer
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
I
do
not
say
that
I
may
not
scatter
your
brain
about
the
fireplace
yet
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
a
just
man
even
to
my
enemy
,
and
I
will
acknowledge
beforehand
that
they
be
cleverer
brain
than
I
think
them
.
<EOS>
come
to
the
point
,
sir
!
<EOS>
You
want
something
of
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
and
I
mean
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
condition

"
  
"
on
no
condition

"
  
<EOS>
His
hand
drop
into
the
drawer
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
<EOS>
we
be
travel
in
a
circle
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
those
clever
brain
of
your
be
in
danger
again
.
<EOS>
Your
tone
be
deplorably
imprudent
,
sir
 
moderate
it
on
the
spot
!
<EOS>
the
risk
of
shoot
you
on
the
place
where
you
stand
be
less
to
me
than
the
risk
of
let
you
out
of
this
house
,
except
on
condition
that
I
dictate
and
approve
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
get
my
lament
friend
to
deal
with
now
 
<EOS>
you
be
face
to
face
with
Fosco

<EOS>
He

with
the
most
supreme
composure
,
and
carelessly
wave
his
right
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
consent
to
hazard
a
guess

jeeringly

<EOS>
He
look
at
me
with
the
first
honest
expression
that
have
cross
his
face
in
my
presence
 
an
expression
of
blank
amazement
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
that
I
sink
in
his
estimation
as
a
dangerous
man
from
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
shut
up
the
drawer
at
once
,
fold
his
arm
over
his
breast
,
and
listen
to
me
with
a
smile

satirical
attention

lower
anxiety

His

eye

wide
and
wide
astonishment

o'clock

clear
half
-
hour

third
condition

satisfaction

the
language
you
have
allow
yourself
to
use

conference

the
time

abroad

I
be
safe
on

continent

and
that
letter

contain
a
strip

paper

accurately
the
length

be
my
term

me

"
  
<EOS>
the
extraordinary
mixture
of
prompt
decision
,
far
-
sight
cunning
,
and
mountebank
bravado
in
this
speech
,
stagger
me
for
a
moment
 
and
only
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
the
one
question
to
consider
be
,
whether
I
be
justified
or
not
in
possess
myself
of
the
mean
of
establish
Laura
's
identity
at
the
cost
of
allow
the
scoundrel
who
have
rob
her
of
it
to
escape
me
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
motive
of
secure
the
just
recognition
of
my
wife
in
the
birthplace
from
which
she
have
be
drive
out
as
an
impostor
,
and
of
publicly
erase
the
lie
that
still
profane
her
mother
's
tombstone
,
be
far
purer
,
in
its
freedom
from
all
taint
of
evil
passion
,
than
the
vindictive
motive
which
have
mingle
itself
with
my
purpose
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
can
not
honestly
say
that
my
own
moral
conviction
be
strong
enough
to
decide
the
struggle
in
me
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
be
help
by
my
remembrance
of
Sir
Percival
's
death
.
<EOS>
how
awfully
,
at
the
last
moment
,
have
the
working
of
the
retribution
there
be
snatch
from
my
feeble
hand
!
<EOS>
what
right
have
I
to
decide
,
in
my
poor
mortal
ignorance
of
the
future
,
that
this
man
,
too
,
must
escape
with
impunity
because
he
escape
me
?
<EOS>
I
think
of
these
thing
 
perhaps
with
the
superstition
inherent
in
my
nature
,
perhaps
with
a
sense
worthier
of
me
than
superstition
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
,
when
I
have
fasten
my
hold
on
him
at
last
,
to
loosen
it
again
of
my
own
accord
 
<EOS>
but
I
force
myself
to
make
the
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
in
plainer
word
,
I
determine
to
be
guide
by
the
one
high
motive
of
which
I
be
certain
,
the
motive
of
serve
the
cause
of
Laura
and
the
cause
of
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
accept
your
condition
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
with
one
reservation
on
my
part

"
what
reservation
may
that
be

<EOS>
he
ask

<EOS>

unopened

presence

soon
as
it

place
in
your
hand

"
  
<EOS>
My
object
in
make
this
stipulation
be
simply
to
prevent
him
from
carry
away
write
evidence
of
the
nature
of
my
communication
with
Pesca
.
<EOS>
the
fact
of
my
communication
he
would
necessarily
discover
,
when
I
give
the
address
to
his
agent
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
make
no
use
of
it
on
his
own
unsupported
testimony
 
even
if
he
really
venture
to
try
the
experiment
 
which
need
excite
in
me
the
slight
apprehension
on
Pesca
's
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
grant
your
reservation
,

he
reply
,
after
consider
the
question
gravely
for
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
worth
dispute
 
the
letter
shall
be
destroy
when
it
come
into
my
hand
.

<EOS>
He
rise
,
as
he
speak
,
from
the
chair
in
which
he
have
be
sit
opposite
to
me
up
to
this
time
.
<EOS>
with
one
effort
he
appear
to
free
his
mind
from
the
whole
pressure
on
it
of
the
interview
between
us
thus
far
.

<EOS>
curiosity
may
stop
here
to
ask
for
some
explanation
of

<EOS>
I
entirely
sympathise
with
the
request

<EOS>
I
also
regret
that
diplomatic
reserve
forbid
me
to
comply
with
it

<EOS>
I
arrange
to
pass
the
preliminary
period
of
repose
,
to
which
I

in

on

occasion
,
by
a
touching
similarity
in

<EOS>
We

I
enter

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
with

I
show
my
empty
purse
and
Percival

<EOS>
let
us
allow
the
deplorable
fact
to
assert
itself
,
once
for
all
,
in
that
manner

and
pass
on

<EOS>
We

<EOS>
just
Heaven

<EOS>
with
what
inconceivable
rapidity
I
learn
to
adore
that
woman

<EOS>
at
sixty

I
worship
her
with
the
volcanic
ardour
of
eighteen

<EOS>
all

<EOS>

<EOS>
It

mine

<EOS>
I
resume
.
  
<EOS>
the
domestic
position
at
the
commencement
of
our
residence
at
Blackwater
Park
have
be
draw
with
amazing
accuracy
,
with
profound
mental
insight
,
by
the
hand
of
marian
herself
.
<EOS>
(
pass
me
the
intoxicate
familiarity
of
mention
this
sublime
creature
by
her
christian
name
.
)
<EOS>
accurate
knowledge
of
the
content
of
her
journal
 
to
which
I
obtain
access
by
clandestine
mean
,
unspeakably
precious
to
me
in
the
remembrance
 
warn
my
eager
pen
from
topic
which
this
essentially
exhaustive
woman
have
already
make
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
the
interest
 
interest
,
breathless
and
immense
!
 
<EOS>
with
which
I
be
here
concern
,
begin
with
the
deplorable
calamity
of
Marian
's
illness
.
  
<EOS>
the
situation
at
this
period
be
emphatically
a
serious
one
.
<EOS>
large
sum
of
money
,
due
at
a
certain
time
,
be
want
by
Percival
(
I
say
nothing
of
the
modicum
equally
necessary
to
myself
)
,
and
the
one
source
to
look
to
for
supply
them
be
the
fortune
of
his
wife
,
of
which
not
one
farthing
be
at
his
disposal
until
her
death
.
<EOS>
bad
so
far
,
and
bad
still
farther
on
.
<EOS>
My
lament
friend
have
private
trouble
of
his
own
,
into
which
the
delicacy
of
my
disintereste
attachment
to
him
forbid
me
from
inquire
too
curiously
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
but
that
a
woman
,
name
Anne
Catherick
,
be
hide
in
the
neighbourhood
,
that
she
be
in
communication
with
Lady
Glyde
,
and
that
the
disclosure
of
a
secret
,
which
would
be
the
certain
ruin
of
Percival
,
may
be
the
result
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
me
himself
that
he
be
a
lost
man
,
unless
his
wife
be
silence
,
and
unless
Anne
Catherick
be
find
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
a
lost
man
,
what
would
become
of
our
pecuniary
interest
?
<EOS>
courageous
as
I
be
by
nature
,
I
absolutely
tremble
at
the
idea
!
  
<EOS>
the
whole
force
of
my
intelligence
be
now
direct
to
the
finding
of
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
Our
money
affair
,
important
as
they
be
,
admit
of
delay
 
but
the
necessity
of
discover
the
woman
admit
of
none
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
her
by
description
,
as
present
an
extraordinary
personal
resemblance
to
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
the
statement
of
this
curious
fact
 
intend
merely
to
assist
me
in
identify
the
person
of
whom
we
be
in
search
 
when
couple
with
the
additional
information
that
Anne
Catherick
have
escape
from
a
mad
-
house
,
start
the
first
immense
conception
in
my
mind
,
which
subsequently
lead
to
such
amazing
result
.
<EOS>
that
conception
involve
nothing
less
than
the
complete
transformation
of
two
separate
identity
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
and
Anne
Catherick
be
to
change
name
,
place
,
and
destiny
,
the
one
with
the
other
 
the
prodigious
consequence
contemplate
by
the
change
be
the
gain
of
thirty
thousand
pound
,
and
the
eternal
preservation
of
Sir
Percival
's
secret
.
  
<EOS>
My
instinct
(
which
seldom
err
)
suggest
to
me
,
on
review
the
circumstance
,
that
our
invisible
Anne
would
,
sooner
or
later
,
return
to
the
boat
-
house
at
the
Blackwater
lake
.
<EOS>
there
I
post
myself
,
previously
mention
to
Mrs.
Michelson
,
the
housekeeper
,
that
I
may
be
find
when
want
,
immerse
in
study
,
in
that
solitary
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
rule
never
to
make
unnecessary
mystery
,
and
never
to
set
people
suspect
me
for
want
of
a
little
seasonable
candour
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Michelson
believe
in
me
from
first
to
last
.
<EOS>
this
ladylike
person
(
widow
of
a
protestant
priest
)
overflow
with
faith
.
<EOS>
touch
by
such
superfluity
of
simple
confidence
in
a
woman
of
her
mature
year
,
I
open
the
ample
reservoir
of
my
nature
and
absorb
it
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
reward
for
post
myself
sentinel
at
the
lake
by
the
appearance
 
not
of
Anne
Catherick
herself
,
but
of
the
person
in
charge
of
her
.
<EOS>
this
individual
also
overflow
with
simple
faith
,
which
I
absorb
in
myself
,
as
in
the
case
already
mention
.
<EOS>
I
leave
her
to
describe
the
circumstance
(
if
she
have
not
do
so
already
)
under
which
she
introduce
me
to
the
object
of
her
maternal
care
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
see
Anne
Catherick
<EOS>
she
be
asleep
.
<EOS>
I
be
electrify
by
the
likeness
between
this
unhappy
woman
and
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
the
detail
of
the
grand
scheme
which
have
suggest
themselves
in
outline
only
,
up
to
that
period
,
occur
to
me
,
in
all
their
masterly
combination
,
at
the
sight
of
the
sleeping
face
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
my
heart
,
always
accessible
to
tender
influence
,
dissolve
in
tear
at
the
spectacle
of
suffer
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
set
myself
to
impart
relief
.
<EOS>
in
other
word
,
I
provide
the
necessary
stimulant
for
strengthen
Anne
Catherick
to
perform
the
journey
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
year
of
my
life
have
be
pass
in
the
ardent
study
of
medical
and
chemical
science
.
<EOS>
chemistry
especially
have
always
have
irresistible
attraction
for
me
from
the
enormous
,
the
illimitable
power
which
the
knowledge
of
it
confer
.
<EOS>
chemist
 
<EOS>
I
assert
it
<EOS>
emphatically
 
may
sway
,
if
they
please
,
the
destiny
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
let
me
explain
this
before
I
go
further
.
  
<EOS>
mind
,
they
say
,
rule
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
what
rule
the
mind
?
<EOS>
the
body
(
follow
me
closely
here
)
lie
at
the
mercy
of
the
most
omnipotent
of
all
potentate
 
the
Chemist
.
<EOS>
give
me
 
Fosco
 
chemistry
;
and
when
Shakespeare
have
conceive
Hamlet
,
and
sit
down
to
execute
the
conception
 
with
a
few
grain
of
powder
drop
into
his
daily
food
,
I
will
reduce
his
mind
,
by
the
action
of
his
body
,
till
his
pen
pour
out
the
most
abject
drivel
that
have
ever
degrade
paper
.
<EOS>
under
similar
circumstance
,
revive
me
the
illustrious
Newton
.
<EOS>
I
guarantee
that
when
he
see
the
apple
fall
he
shall
eat
it
,
instead
of
discover
the
principle
of
gravitation
.
<EOS>
Nero
's
dinner
shall
transform
Nero
into
the
mild
of
man
before
he
have
do
digest
it
,
and
the
morning
draught
of
Alexander
the
Great
shall
make
Alexander
run
for
his
life
at
the
first
sight
of
the
enemy
the
same
afternoon
.
<EOS>
on
my
sacred
word
of
honour
it
be
lucky
for
society
that
modern
chemist
be
,
by
incomprehensible
good
fortune
,
the
most
harmless
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
the
mass
be
worthy
father
of
family
,
who
keep
shop
.
<EOS>
the
few
be
philosopher
besotte
with
admiration
for
the
sound
of
their
own
lecturing
voice
,
visionary
who
waste
their
life
on
fantastic
impossibility
,
or
quack
whose
ambition
soar
no
high
than
our
corn
.
<EOS>
thus
Society
escape
,
and
the
illimitable
power
of
Chemistry
remain
the
slave
of
the
most
superficial
and
the
most
insignificant
end
.
  
<EOS>
why
this
outburst
?
<EOS>
why
this
wither
eloquence
?
  
<EOS>
because
my
conduct
have
be
misrepresent
,
because
my
motive
have
be
misunderstood
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
assume
that
I
use
my
vast
chemical
resource
against
Anne
Catherick
,
and
that
I
would
have
use
them
if
I
could
against
the
magnificent
marian
herself
.
<EOS>
odious
insinuation
both
!
<EOS>
all
my
interest
be
concern
(
as
will
be
see
presently
)
in
the
preservation
of
Anne
Catherick
's
life
.
<EOS>
all
my
anxiety
be
concentrate
on
Marian
's
rescue
from
the
hand
of
the
licensed
imbecile
who
attend
her
,
and
who
find
my
advice
confirm
from
first
to
last
by
the
physician
from
London
.
<EOS>
on
two
occasion
only
 
both
equally
harmless
to
the
individual
on
whom
I
practise
 
<EOS>
do
I
summon
to
myself
the
assistance
of
chemical
knowledge
.
<EOS>
on
the
first
of
the
two
,
after
follow
Marian
to
the
inn
at
Blackwater
(
study
,
behind
a
convenient
waggon
which
hide
me
from
her
,
the
poetry
of
motion
,
as
embody
in
her
walk
)
,
I
avail
myself
of
the
service
of
my
invaluable
wife
,
to
copy
one
and
to
intercept
the
other
of
two
letter
which
my
adore
enemy
have
entrust
to
a
discard
maid
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
,
the
letter
be
in
the
bosom
of
the
girl
's
dress
,
Madame
Fosco
could
only
open
them
,
read
them
,
perform
her
instruction
,
seal
them
,
and
put
them
back
again
by
scientific
assistance
 
<EOS>
which
assistance
I
render
in
a
half
-
ounce
bottle
.
<EOS>
the
second
occasion
,
when
the
same
mean
be
employ
,
be
the
occasion
(
to
which
I
shall
soon
refer
)
of
Lady
Glyde
's
arrival
in
London
.
<EOS>
never
at
any
other
time
be
I
indebted
to
my
art
as
distinguish
from
myself
.
<EOS>
to
all
other
emergency
and
complication
my
natural
capacity
for
grapple
,
single
-
handed
,
with
circumstance
,
be
invariably
equal
.
<EOS>
I
affirm
the
all
-
pervade
intelligence
of
that
capacity
.
<EOS>
at
the
expense
of
the
Chemist
I
vindicate
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
respect
this
outburst
of
generous
indignation
.
<EOS>
It
have
inexpressibly
relieve
me
.
<EOS>
en
route
!
<EOS>
let
us
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
have
suggest
to
Mrs.
Clement
(
or
clement
,
I
be
not
sure
which
)
that
the
good
method
of
keep
Anne
out
of
Percival
's
reach
be
to
remove
her
to
London
 
have
find
that
my
proposal
be
eagerly
receive
,
and
have
appoint
a
day
to
meet
the
traveller
at
the
station
and
to
see
them
leave
it
,
I
be
at
liberty
to
return
to
the
house
and
to
confront
the
difficulty
which
still
remain
to
be
meet
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
proceeding
be
to
avail
myself
of
the
sublime
devotion
of
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
have
arrange
with
Mrs.
Clements
that
she
should
communicate
her
London
address
,
in
Anne
's
interest
,
to
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
enough
.
<EOS>
design
person
in
my
absence
may
shake
the
simple
confidence
of
Mrs.
Clements
,
and
she
may
not
write
after
all
.
<EOS>
who
could
I
find
capable
of
travel
to
London
by
the
train
she
travel
by
,
and
of
privately
see
her
home
?
<EOS>
I
ask
myself
this
question
.
<EOS>
the
conjugal
part
of
me
immediately
answer
 
Madame
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
after
decide
on
my
wife
's
mission
to
London
,
I
arrange
that
the
journey
should
serve
a
double
purpose
.
<EOS>
a
nurse
for
the
suffer
Marian
,
equally
devoted
to
the
patient
and
to
myself
,
be
a
necessity
of
my
position
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
most
eminently
confidential
and
capable
woman
in
existence
be
by
good
fortune
at
my
disposal
.
<EOS>
I
refer
to
that
respectable
matron
,
Madame
Rubelle
,
to
whom
I
address
a
letter
,
at
her
residence
in
London
,
by
the
hand
of
my
wife
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
appoint
day
Mrs.
Clements
and
Anne
Catherick
meet
me
at
the
station
.
<EOS>
I
politely
see
them
off
,
I
politely
see
Madame
Fosco
off
by
the
same
train
.
<EOS>
the
last
thing
at
night
my
wife
return
to
Blackwater
,
have
follow
her
instruction
with
the
most
unimpeachable
accuracy
.
<EOS>
She
be
accompany
by
Madame
Rubelle
,
and
she
bring
me
the
London
address
of
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
after
-
event
prove
this
last
precaution
to
have
be
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
punctually
inform
Lady
Glyde
of
her
place
of
abode
.
<EOS>
with
a
wary
eye
on
future
emergency
,
I
keep
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
day
I
have
a
brief
interview
with
the
doctor
,
at
which
I
protest
,
in
the
sacred
interest
of
humanity
,
against
his
treatment
of
Marian
's
case
.
<EOS>
He
be
insolent
,
as
all
ignorant
people
be
.
<EOS>
I
show
no
resentment
,
I
defer
quarrel
with
him
till
it
be
necessary
to
quarrel
to
some
purpose
.
<EOS>
My
next
proceeding
be
to
leave
Blackwater
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
London
residence
to
take
in
anticipation
of
come
event
.
<EOS>
I
have
also
a
little
business
of
the
domestic
sort
to
transact
with
Mr.
Frederick
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
I
find
the
house
I
want
in
St.
John
's
Wood
.
<EOS>
I
find
Mr.
Fairlie
at
Limmeridge
,
Cumberland
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
private
familiarity
with
the
nature
of
Marian
's
correspondence
have
previously
inform
me
that
she
have
write
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
propose
,
as
a
relief
to
Lady
Glyde
's
matrimonial
embarrassment
,
to
take
her
on
a
visit
to
her
uncle
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
this
letter
I
have
wisely
allow
to
reach
its
destination
,
feel
at
the
time
that
it
could
do
no
harm
,
and
may
do
good
.
<EOS>
I
now
present
myself
before
Mr.
Fairlie
to
support
Marian
's
own
proposal
 
with
certain
modification
which
,
happily
for
the
success
of
my
plan
,
be
render
really
inevitable
by
her
illness
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
that
Lady
Glyde
should
leave
Blackwater
alone
,
by
her
uncle
's
invitation
,
and
that
she
should
rest
a
night
on
the
journey
at
her
aunt
's
house
(
the
house
I
have
in
St.
John
's
Wood
)
by
her
uncle
's
express
advice
.
<EOS>
to
achieve
these
result
,
and
to
secure
a
note
of
invitation
which
could
be
show
to
Lady
Glyde
,
be
the
object
of
my
visit
to
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
mention
that
this
gentleman
be
equally
feeble
in
mind
and
body
,
and
that
I
let
loose
the
whole
force
of
my
character
on
him
,
I
have
say
enough
.
<EOS>
I
come
,
see
,
and
conquer
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
on
my
return
to
Blackwater
Park
(
with
the
letter
of
invitation
)
I
find
that
the
doctor
's
imbecile
treatment
of
Marian
's
case
have
lead
to
the
most
alarming
result
.
<EOS>
the
fever
have
turn
to
typhus
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
,
on
the
day
of
my
return
,
try
to
force
herself
into
the
room
to
nurse
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
and
I
have
no
affinity
of
sympathy
 
<EOS>
she
have
commit
the
unpardonable
outrage
on
my
sensibility
of
call
me
a
spy
 
<EOS>
she
be
a
stumbling
-
block
in
my
way
and
in
<EOS>
Percival
's
 
but
,
for
all
that
,
my
magnanimity
forbid
me
to
put
her
in
danger
of
infection
with
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
I
offer
no
hindrance
to
her
put
herself
in
danger
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
succeed
in
do
so
,
the
intricate
knot
which
I
be
slowly
and
patiently
operate
on
may
perhaps
have
be
cut
by
circumstance
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
the
doctor
interfere
and
she
be
keep
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
myself
previously
recommend
send
for
advice
to
London
.
<EOS>
this
course
have
be
now
take
.
<EOS>
the
physician
,
on
his
arrival
,
confirm
my
view
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
the
crisis
be
serious
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
hope
of
our
charming
patient
on
the
fifth
day
from
the
appearance
of
the
typhus
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
once
absent
from
Blackwater
at
this
time
 
when
I
go
to
London
by
the
morning
train
to
make
the
final
arrangement
at
my
house
in
St.
John
's
Wood
,
to
assure
myself
by
private
inquiry
that
Mrs.
Clements
have
not
move
,
and
to
settle
one
or
two
little
preliminary
matter
with
the
husband
of
Madame
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
I
return
at
night
.
<EOS>
five
day
afterwards
the
physician
pronounce
our
interesting
Marian
to
be
out
of
all
danger
,
and
to
be
in
need
of
nothing
but
careful
nursing
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
time
I
have
wait
for
.
<EOS>
now
that
medical
attendance
be
no
longer
indispensable
,
I
play
the
first
move
in
the
game
by
assert
myself
against
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
among
many
witness
in
my
way
whom
it
be
necessary
to
remove
.
<EOS>
a
lively
altercation
between
us
(
in
which
Percival
,
previously
instruct
by
me
,
refuse
to
interfere
)
serve
the
purpose
in
view
.
<EOS>
I
descend
on
the
miserable
man
in
an
irresistible
avalanche
of
indignation
,
and
sweep
him
from
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
servant
be
the
next
encumbrance
to
get
rid
of
.
<EOS>
again
I
instruct
Percival
(
whose
moral
courage
require
perpetual
stimulant
)
,
and
Mrs.
Michelson
be
amazed
,
one
day
,
by
hear
from
her
master
that
the
establishment
be
to
be
break
up
.
<EOS>
We
clear
the
house
of
all
the
servant
but
one
,
who
be
keep
for
domestic
purpose
,
and
whose
lumpish
stupidity
we
could
trust
to
make
no
embarrassing
discovery
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
go
,
nothing
remain
but
to
relieve
ourselves
of
Mrs.
Michelson
 
a
result
which
be
easily
achieve
by
send
this
amiable
lady
to
find
lodging
for
her
mistress
at
the
sea
-
side
.
  
<EOS>
the
circumstance
be
now
exactly
what
they
be
require
to
be
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
be
confine
to
her
room
by
nervous
illness
,
and
the
lumpish
housemaid
(
I
forget
her
name
)
be
shut
up
there
at
night
in
attendance
on
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
Marian
,
though
fast
recovering
,
still
keep
her
bed
,
with
Mrs.
Rubelle
for
nurse
.
<EOS>
no
other
live
creature
but
my
wife
,
myself
,
and
Percival
be
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
with
all
the
chance
thus
in
our
favour
I
confront
the
next
emergency
,
and
play
the
second
move
in
the
game
.
  
<EOS>
the
object
of
the
second
move
be
to
induce
Lady
Glyde
to
leave
Blackwater
unaccompanied
by
her
sister
.
<EOS>
unless
we
could
persuade
her
that
Marian
have
go
on
to
Cumberland
first
,
there
be
no
chance
of
remove
her
,
of
her
own
free
will
,
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
to
produce
this
necessary
operation
in
her
mind
,
we
conceal
our
interesting
invalid
in
one
of
the
uninhabited
bedroom
at
Blackwater
.
<EOS>
at
the
dead
of
night
Madame
Fosco
,
Madame
Rubelle
,
and
myself
<EOS>
(
Percival
not
be
cool
enough
to
be
trust
)
accomplish
the
concealment
.
<EOS>
the
scene
be
picturesque
,
mysterious
,
dramatic
in
the
high
degree
.
<EOS>
by
my
direction
the
bed
have
be
make
,
in
the
morning
,
on
a
strong
movable
framework
of
wood
.
<EOS>
We
have
only
to
lift
the
framework
gently
at
the
head
and
foot
,
and
to
transport
our
patient
where
we
please
,
without
disturb
herself
or
her
bed
.
<EOS>
no
chemical
assistance
be
need
or
use
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
Our
interesting
Marian
lie
in
the
deep
repose
of
convalescence
.
<EOS>
We
place
the
candle
and
open
the
door
beforehand
.
<EOS>
I
,
in
right
of
my
great
personal
strength
,
take
the
head
of
the
framework
 
<EOS>
my
wife
and
Madame
Rubelle
take
the
foot
.
<EOS>
I
bear
my
share
of
that
inestimably
precious
burden
with
a
manly
tenderness
,
with
a
fatherly
care
.
<EOS>
where
be
the
modern
Rembrandt
who
could
depict
our
midnight
procession
?
<EOS>
alas
for
the
art
!
<EOS>
alas
for
this
most
pictorial
of
subject
!
<EOS>
the
modern
Rembrandt
be
nowhere
to
be
find
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
my
wife
and
I
start
for
London
,
leave
Marian
seclude
,
in
the
uninhabited
middle
of
the
house
,
under
care
of
Madame
Rubelle
,
who
kindly
consent
to
imprison
herself
with
her
patient
for
two
or
three
day
.
<EOS>
before
take
our
departure
I
give
Percival
Mr.
Fairlie
's
letter
of
invitation
to
his
niece
(
instruct
her
to
sleep
on
the
journey
to
Cumberland
at
her
aunt
's
house
)
,
with
direction
to
show
it
to
Lady
Glyde
on
hear
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
also
obtain
from
him
the
address
of
the
Asylum
in
which
Anne
Catherick
have
be

,
and
a
letter
to
the
proprietor
,
announce
to
that
gentleman

return
of
his
runaway
patient
to
medical
care
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
arrange
,
at
my
last
visit
to
the
metropolis
,
to
have
our
modest
domestic
establishment
ready
to
receive
us
when
we
arrive
in
London
by
the
early
train
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
wise
precaution
,
we
be
enable
that
same
day
to
play
the
third
move
in
the
game
 
the
get
possession
of
Anne
Catherick
.
  
<EOS>
date
be
of
importance
here
.
<EOS>
I
combine
in
myself
the
opposite
characteristic
of
a
Man
of
Sentiment
and
a
Man
of
Business
.
<EOS>
I
have
all
the
date
at
my
finger
'
end
.
  
<EOS>
on
Wednesday
,
the
24th
of
July
1850
,
I
send
my
wife
in
a
cab
to
clear
Mrs.
Clements
out
of
the
way
,
in
the
first
place
.
<EOS>
a
suppose
message
from
Lady
Glyde
in
London
be
sufficient
to
obtain
this
result
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
be
take
away
in
the
cab
,
and
be
leave
in
the
cab
,
while
my
wife
(
on
pretence
of
purchase
something
at
a
shop
)
give
her
the
slip
,
and
return
to
receive
her
expected
visitor
at
our
house
in
St.
John
's
Wood
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
the
visitor
have
be
describe
to
the
servant
as
"
Lady
Glyde
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
I
have
follow
in
another
cab
,
with
a
note
for
Anne
Catherick
,
merely
mention
that
Lady
Glyde
intend
to
keep
Mrs.
Clements
to
spend
the
day
with
her
,
and
that
she
be
to
join
them
under
care
of
the
good
gentleman
wait
outside
,
who
have
already
save
her
from
discovery
in
Hampshire
by
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
the
"
good
gentleman
"
send
in
this
note
by
a
street
boy
,
and
pause
for
result
a
door
or
two
farther
on
.
<EOS>
at
the
moment
when
Anne
appear
at
the
house

and
close
it
<EOS>
this
excellent
man
have
the
cab
door
open
ready
for
her
,
absorb
her
into
the
vehicle
,
and
drive
off
.
  
<EOS>
(
pass
me
,
here
,
one
exclamation
in
parenthesis
.
<EOS>
how
interesting
this
be
!
)
  
<EOS>
on
the
way
to
Forest
Road
<EOS>
my
companion
show
no
fear
.
<EOS>
I
can
be
paternal
 
<EOS>
no
man
<EOS>
more
so
 
<EOS>
when
I
please
,
<EOS>
and
I
be
intensely
paternal
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
what
title
I
have
to
her
confidence
!
<EOS>
I
have
compound
the
medicine
which
have
do
her
good
 
<EOS>
I
have
warn
her
of
her
danger
from
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
trust
too
implicitly
to
these
title
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
underrate
the
keenness
of
the
low
instinct
in
person
of
weak
intellect
 
<EOS>
it
be
certain
that
I
neglect
to
prepare
her
sufficiently
for
a
disappointment
on
enter
my
house
.
<EOS>
when
I
take
her
into
the
drawing
-
room
 
when
she
see
no
one
present
but
Madame
Fosco
,
who
be
a
stranger
to
her
 
<EOS>
she
exhibit
the
most
violent
agitation
;
if
she
have
scent
danger
in
the
air
,
as
a
dog
scent
the
presence
of
some
creature
unseen
,
her
alarm
could
not
have
display
itself
more
suddenly
and
more
causelessly
.
<EOS>
I
interpose
in
vain
.
<EOS>
the
fear
from
which
she
be
suffer
I
may
have
soothe
,
but
the
serious
heart
-
disease
,
under
which
she
labour
,
be
beyond
the
reach
of
all
moral
palliative
.
<EOS>
to
my
unspeakable
horror
she
be
seize
with
convulsion
 
a
shock
to
the
system
,
in
her
condition
,
which
may
have
lay
her
dead
at
any
moment
at
our
foot
.
  
<EOS>
the
near
doctor
be
send
for
,
and
be
tell
that
"
Lady
Glyde
"
require
his
immediate
service
.
<EOS>
to
my
infinite
relief
,
he
be
a
capable
man
.
<EOS>
I
represent
my
visitor
to
him
as
a
person
of
weak
intellect
,
and
subject
to
delusion
,
and
I
arrange
that
no
nurse
<EOS>
but
my
wife
should
watch
in
the
sick
-
room
.
<EOS>
the
unhappy
woman
be
too
ill
,
however
,
to
cause
any
anxiety
about
what
she
may
say
.
<EOS>
the
one
dread
which
now
oppress
me
be
the
dread
that
the
false
Lady
Glyde
may
die
before
the
true
Lady
Glyde
arrive
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
write
a
note
in
the
morning
to
Madame
Rubelle
,
tell
her
to
join
me
at
her
husband
's
house
on
the
evening
of
Friday
the
26th
,
with
another
note
to
Percival
,
warn
him
to
show
his
wife
her
uncle
's
letter
of
invitation
,
to
assert
that
Marian
have
go
on
before
her
,
and
to
despatch
her
to
town
by
the
midday
train
,
on
the
26th
,
also
.
<EOS>
on
reflection
I
have
feel
the
necessity
,
in
Anne
Catherick
's
state
of
health
,
of
precipitate
event
,
and
of
have
Lady
Glyde
at
my
disposal
earlier
than
I
have
originally
contemplate
.
<EOS>
what
fresh
direction
,
in
the
terrible
uncertainty
of
my
position
,
could
I
now
issue
?
<EOS>
I
could
do
nothing
but
trust
to
chance
and
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
My
emotion
express
themselves
in
pathetic
apostrophe
,
which
I
be
just
self
-
possess
enough
to
couple
,
in
the
hearing
of
other
people
,
with
the
name
of
"
Lady
Glyde

<EOS>
"
in
all
other

a
bad
night
<EOS>

but
later
in
the
day
she
revive
amazingly
.
<EOS>
My
elastic
spirit

with
her
.
<EOS>
I
could
receive
no
answer
from
Percival
and
Madame
Rubelle
till
the
morning
of
the
next
day
,
the
26th
.
<EOS>
in
anticipation
of
their
follow
my
direction
,
which
,
accident
apart
,
I
know
they
would
do
,
I
go
to
secure
a
fly
to
fetch
Lady
Glyde
from
the
railway
,
direct
it
to
be
at
my
house
on
the
26th
,
at
two
o'clock
.
<EOS>
after
see
the
order
enter
in
the
book

at
stake

<EOS>
a
medicated
glass

<EOS>
throughout

day
I
keep
our

suspend
consciousness
,
until
the
dexterous
assistance
of
my
medical

rather
earlier
than
I
have
venture
to

<EOS>
that

(
the

of
the
27th
)
<EOS>
Madame

and
to
the

's
own
confused
mental
condition
at
the

.
<EOS>
I
return
at
once
to
assist
Madame
Fosco
in
the
preparation
for
the
burial
of
the
false
"
Lady
Glyde
,
"

<EOS>
I
attend
the
funeral
,
with
become
dignity
,
attire
in
the
deep
mourning
.
  
<EOS>
My
narrative
of
these
remarkable
event
,
write
under
equally
remarkable
circumstance
,
close
here
.
<EOS>
the
minor
precaution
which
I
observe
in
communicate
with
Limmeridge
House
be
already
know
,
so
be
the
magnificent
success
of
my
enterprise
,
so
be
the
solid
pecuniary
result
which
follow
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
assert
,
with
the
whole
force
of
my
conviction
,
that
the
one
weak
place
in
my
scheme
would
never
have
be
find
out
if
the
one
weak
place
in
my
heart
have
not
be
discover
first
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
my
fatal
admiration
for
Marian
restrain
me
from
step
in
to
my
own
rescue
when
she
effect
her
sister
's
escape
.
<EOS>
I
run
the
risk
,
and
trust
in
the
complete
destruction
of
Lady
Glyde
's
identity
.
<EOS>
if
either
Marian
or
Mr.
Hartright
attempt
to
assert
that
identity
,
they
would
publicly
expose
themselves
to
the
imputation
of
sustain
a
rank
deception
,
they
would
be
distrust
and
discredit
accordingly
,
and
they
would
therefore
be
powerless
to
place
my
interest
or
Percival
's
secret
in
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
I
commit
one
error
in
trust
myself
to
such
a
blindfold
calculation
of
chance
as
this
.
<EOS>
I
commit
another
when
Percival
have
pay
the
penalty
of
his
own
obstinacy
and
violence
,
by
grant
Lady
Glyde
a
second
reprieve
from
the
mad
-
house
,
and
allow
Mr.
Hartright
a
second
chance
of
escape
me
.
<EOS>
in
brief
,
Fosco
,
at
this
serious
crisis
,
be
untrue
to
himself
.
<EOS>
deplorable
and
uncharacteristic
fault
!
<EOS>
Behold
the
cause
,
in
my
heart
 
behold
,
in
the
image
of
Marian
Halcombe
,
the
first
and
last
weakness
of
Fosco
's
life
!
  
<EOS>
at
the
ripe
age
of
sixty
,
I
make
this
unparalleled
confession
.
<EOS>
youth
!
<EOS>
I
invoke
your
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Maidens
!
<EOS>
I
claim
your

<EOS>
a
word
more
,
and
the
attention
of
the
reader
(
concentrate
breathlessly
on
myself
)
shall
be
release
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
mental
insight
inform
me
that
three
inevitable
question
will
be
ask
here
by
person
of
inquire
mind
.
<EOS>
They
shall
be
state
 
they
shall
be
answer
.
  
<EOS>
first
question
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
secret
of
Madame
Fosco
's
unhesitating
devotion
of
herself
to
the
fulfilment
of
my
bold
wish
,
to
the
furtherance
of
my
deep
plan
?
<EOS>
I
may
answer
this
by
simply
refer
to
my
own
character
,
and
by
ask
,
in
my
turn
,
where
,
in
the
history
of
the
world
,
have
a
man
of
my
order
ever
be
find
without
a
woman
in
the
background
self
-
immolate
on
the
altar
of
his
life
?
<EOS>
but
I
remember
that
I
be
write
in
England
,
I
remember
that
I
be
married
in
England
,
and
I
ask
if
a
woman
's
marriage
obligation
in
this
country
provide
for
her
private
opinion
of
her
husband
's
principle
?
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
They
charge
her
unreservedly
to
love
,
honour
,
and
obey
him
.
<EOS>
that
be
exactly
what
my
wife
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
stand
here
on
a
supreme
moral
elevation
,
and
I
loftily
assert
her
accurate
performance
of
her
conjugal
duty
.
<EOS>
Silence
,
Calumny
!
<EOS>
Your
sympathy
,
Wives
of
England
,
for
Madame
Fosco
!
  
<EOS>
second
question
.
<EOS>
if
Anne
Catherick
have
not
die
when
she
do
,
what
should
I
have
do
?
<EOS>
I
should
,
in
that
case
,
have
assist
wear
-
out
Nature
in
find
permanent
repose
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
open
the
door
of
the
Prison
of
Life
,
and
have
extend
to
the
captive
(
incurably
afflict
in
mind
and
body
both
)
a
happy
release
.
  
<EOS>
third
question
.
<EOS>
on
a
calm
revision
of
all
the
circumstance
 
be
my
conduct
worthy
of
any
serious
blame
?
<EOS>
most
emphatically
,
no
!
<EOS>
have
I
not
carefully
avoid
expose
myself
to
the
odium
of
commit
unnecessary
crime
?
<EOS>
with
my
vast
resource
in
chemistry
,
I
may
have
take
Lady
Glyde
's
life
.
<EOS>
at
immense
personal
sacrifice
I
follow
the
dictate
of
my
own
ingenuity
,
my
own
humanity
,
my
own
caution
,
and
take
her
identity
instead
.
<EOS>
judge
me
by
what
I
may
have
do
.
<EOS>
how
comparatively
innocent
!
<EOS>
how
indirectly
virtuous
I
appear
in
what
I
really
do
!
  
<EOS>
I
announce
on
begin
it
that
this
narrative
would
be
a
remarkable
document
.
<EOS>
It
have
entirely
answer
my
expectation
.
<EOS>
receive
these
fervid
line
 
my
last
legacy
to
the
country
I
leave
for
ever
.
<EOS>
They
be
worthy
of
the
occasion
,
and
worthy
of
  
FOSCO
.

<EOS>
I
now
have
in
my
possession
all
the
paper

I
want
 
the

<EOS>
with
this

evidence
about

and
with
the
coachman
's
answer
fresh
in
my
memory
,
I
next
turn
my
step
,
for
the
first
time
since
the
beginning
of
all
my
inquiry
,
in
the
direction
of
Mr.
Kyrle
's
office

<EOS>
one
of
my
object
in
pay
him

second
visit
be
,
necessarily

to
tell
him
what
I
have
do

<EOS>
the
other
be
to
warn
him
of
my
resolution
to
take
my
wife
to
Limmeridge
the
next
morning
,
and
to
have
her
publicly
receive
and
recognise
in
her
uncle
's
house
.
<EOS>
I
leave
it
to
Mr.
Kyrle
to
decide
under
these
circumstance
,
and
in
Mr.
Gilmore
's
absence
,
whether
he
be
or
be
not
bind
,
as
the
family
solicitor
,
to
be
present
on
that
occasion
in
the
family
interest
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
of
Mr.
Kyrle
's
amazement
,
or
of
the
term
in
which
he
express
his
opinion
of
my
conduct
from
the
first
stage
of
the
investigation
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
necessary
to
mention
that
he
at
once
decide
on
accompany
us
to
Cumberland
.
  
<EOS>
We
start
the
next
morning
by
the
early
train
.
<EOS>
Laura
,
Marian
,
Mr.
Kyrle
,
and
myself
in
one
carriage
,
and
John
Owen
,
with
a
clerk
from
Mr.
Kyrle
's
office
,
occupy
place
in
another
.
<EOS>
on
reach
the
Limmeridge
station
we
go
first
to
the
farmhouse
at
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
firm
determination
that
Laura
should
not
enter
her
uncle
's
house
till
she
appear
there
publicly
recognise
as
his
niece
.
<EOS>
I
leave
Marian
to
settle
the
question
of
accommodation
with
Mrs.
Todd
,
as
soon
as
the
good
woman
have
recover
from
the
bewilderment
of
hear
what
our
errand
be
in
Cumberland
,
and
I
arrange
with
her
husband
that
John
Owen
be
to
be
commit
to
the
ready
hospitality
of
the
farm
-
servant
.
<EOS>
these
preliminary
complete
,
Mr.
Kyrle
and
I
set
forth
together
for
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
write
at
any
length
of
our
interview
with
Mr.
Fairlie
,
for
I
can
not
recall
it
to
mind
without
feeling
of
impatience
and
contempt
,
which
make
the
scene
,
even
in
remembrance
<EOS>
only
,
utterly
repulsive
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
to
record
simply
that
I
carry
my
point
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
attempt
to
treat
us
on
his
customary
plan
.
<EOS>
We
pass
without
notice
his
polite
insolence
at
the
outset
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
We
hear
without
sympathy
the
protestation
with
which
he
try
next
to
persuade
us
that
the
disclosure
of
the
conspiracy
have
overwhelm
him
.
<EOS>
He
absolutely
whine
and
whimper
at
last
like
a
fretful
child
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
know
that
his
niece
be
alive
when
he
be
tell
that
she
be
dead
?
<EOS>
He
would
welcome
dear
Laura
with
pleasure
,
if
we
would
only
allow
him
time
to
recover
.
<EOS>
do
we
think
he
look
as
if
he
want
hurry
into
his
grave
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
then
,
why
hurry
him
?
"
<EOS>
He
reiterate
these
remonstrance
at
every
available
opportunity
,
until
I
check
them
once
for
all
,
by
place
him
firmly
between
two
inevitable
alternative
.
<EOS>
I
give
him
his
choice
between
do
his
niece
justice
on
my
term
,
or
face
the
consequence
of
a
public
assertion
of
her
existence
in
a
court
of
law
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kyrle
,
to
whom
he
turn
for
help
,
tell
him
plainly
that
he
must
decide
the
question
then
and
there
.
<EOS>
characteristically
choose
the
alternative
which
promise
soonest
to
release
him
from
all
personal
anxiety
,
he
announce
with
a
sudden
outburst
of
energy
,
that
he
be
not
strong
enough
to
bear
any
more
bullying
,
and
that
we
may
do
as
we
please
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kyrle
and
I
at
once
go
downstairs
,
and
agree
upon
a
form
of
letter
which
be
to
be
send
round
to
the
tenant
who
have
attend
the
false
funeral
,
summon
them

Fairlie
should
hear

<EOS>
I
occupy
the
interval
day
at
the
farm
in
write
a
plain
narrative
of
the
conspiracy
,
and
in
add
to
it
a
statement
of
the
practical
contradiction
which
fact
offer
to
the
assertion
of
Laura
's
death
.
<EOS>
this
I
submit
to
Mr.
Kyrle
before
I
read
it
the
next
day
to
the
assemble
tenant
.
<EOS>
We
also
arrange

<EOS>
after

conversation
next
to
Laura

<EOS>
Knowing

of
my
conduct
in
relation

my
wife
's
life

me
if
I
abstain
from
discuss
the
subject
.
<EOS>
It
be
connect
,
as
I
could
truly
tell
him
,
with
those
sorrow
and
trouble
of
the
past
which
we
never
refer
to
among
ourselves
,
and
which
we
instinctively
shrink
from
discuss
with
other
.
  
<EOS>
My

be
to
obtain
"

the

<EOS>
all
the

<EOS>
a
perceptible
shock
of
surprise
,

audible
murmur
of
interest

through
them
,
at
the
sight
of
her
face
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
be
present
(
by

express
stipulation
)
,
with
Mr.

by
his
side
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
I

himself
in
these

<EOS>
please

"
<EOS>
with
those
word
he
slowly
sink
back
again
into
the

,
and
take
refuge
in
his
scented
pocket
-

.
  
<EOS>
the

<EOS>
I

thirdly

to
give
them
a
plain
account
of
how

.
<EOS>
without
further
preface
,
I
at
once
read
the
narrative
of
the
conspiracy
,
describe
it
in
clear
outline
,
and
dwell
only
upon
the
pecuniary
motive
for
it
,
in
order
to
avoid
complicate
my
statement
by
unnecessary
reference
to
Sir
Percival
's
secret
.
<EOS>
this
do
,
I
remind
my
audience
of

statement
of
the
meeting
between
Laura
and
herself
at
the
mad

house
,
and
of
her

<EOS>
after

I

<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
advance
towards
them
a
few
step
,
and
point
to
my
wife
.
  
<EOS>
the
effect
of
the
question

electrical

<EOS>
far
down
at
the
low
end
of
the
room
one
of
the
old
tenant
on
the
estate
start
to
his
foot

and
lead

<EOS>
I

assemble
on

<EOS>
the
farmer

and
to
implore
her

with
the
tear
pour
over
their

,
to
bear
up
bravely
and
not

<EOS>
She

and
carry

<EOS>
there
I
give

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
then
there

Mr.
Fairlie
nee
not
entertain
the
slight
apprehension
of
ever
see
us
or
hear
from
us
again
.
<EOS>
We
go
back
to
our
friend
at
the
farm
to
rest
that
night
,
and
the
next
morning
 
escort
to
the
station
,
with
the
heartiest
enthusiasm
and
good
will
,
by
the
whole
village
and
by
all
the
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
 
<EOS>
we
return
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
as
our
view
of
the
Cumberland
hill
fade
in
the
distance
,
I
think
of
the
first
dishearten
circumstance
under
which
the
long
struggle
that
be
now
past
and
over
have
be
pursue
.
<EOS>
It
be
strange
to
look
back
and
to
see
,
now
,
that
the
poverty
which
have
deny
us
all
hope
of
assistance
have
be
the
indirect
mean
of
our
success
,
by
force
me
to
act
for
myself
.
<EOS>
if
we
have
be
rich
enough
to
find
legal
help
,
what
would
have
be
the
result
?
<EOS>
the
gain
(
on
Mr.
Kyrle
's
own
showing
)
would
have
be
more
than
doubtful
 
<EOS>
the
loss
,
judge
by
the
plain
test
of
event
as
they
have
really
happen
,
certain
.
<EOS>
the
law
would
never
have
obtain
me
my
interview
with
Mrs.
Catherick
.
<EOS>
the
law
would
never
have
make
Pesca
the
mean
of
force
a
confession
from
the
Count
.
    
<EOS>
two
more
event
remain
to
be
add
to
the
chain
before
it
reach
fairly
from
the
outset
of
the
story
to
the
close
.
  
<EOS>
while
our
new
sense
of
freedom
from
the
long
oppression
of
the
past
be
still
strange
to
us
,
I
be
send
for
by
the
friend
who
have
give
me
my
first
employment
in
wood
engraving
,
to
receive
from
him
a
fresh
testimony
of
his
regard
for
my
welfare
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
commission
by
his
employer
to
go
to
Paris
,
and
to
examine
for
them
a
fresh
discovery
in
the
practical
application
of
his
Art
,
the
merit
of
which
they
be
anxious
to
ascertain
.
<EOS>
His
own
engagement
have
not
allow
him
leisure
time
to
undertake
the
errand
,
and
he
have
most
kindly
suggest
that
it
should
be
transfer
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
no
hesitation
in
thankfully
accept
the
offer
,
for
if
I
acquit
myself
of
my
commission
as
I
hope
I
should
,
the
result
would
be
a
permanent
engagement
on
the
illustrate
newspaper
,
to
which
I
be
now
only
occasionally
attach
.
  
<EOS>
I
receive
my
instruction
and
pack
up
for
the
journey
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
on
leave
Laura
once
more
(
under
what
change
circumstance
!
)
<EOS>
in
her
sister
's
care
,
a
serious
consideration
recur
to
me
,
which
have
more
than
once
cross
my
wife
's
mind
,
as
well
as
my
own
,
already
 
I
mean
the
consideration
of
Marian
's
future
.
<EOS>
have
we
any
right
to
let
our
selfish
affection
accept
the
devotion
of
all
that
generous
life
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
our
duty
,
our
good
expression
of
gratitude
,
to
forget
ourselves
,
and
to
think
only
of
HER
?
<EOS>
I
try
to
say
this
when
we
be
alone
for
a
moment
,
before
I
go
away
.
<EOS>
She
take
my
hand
,
and
silence
me
at
the
first
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
all
that
we
three
have
suffer
together
,
"
she
say
"
there
can
be
no
parting
between
us
till
the
last
parting
of
all
.
<EOS>
My
heart
and
my
happiness
,
Walter
,
be
with
Laura
and
you
.
<EOS>
wait
a
little
till
there
be
child
's
voice
at
your
fireside
.
<EOS>
I
will
teach
them
to
speak
for
me
in
their
language
,
and
the
first
lesson
they
say
to
their
father
and
mother
shall
be
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
spare
our
aunt
!

"
  
<EOS>
My
journey
to
Paris
be
not
undertake
alone
.
<EOS>
at
the
eleventh
hour
Pesca
decide
that
he
would
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
recover
his
customary
cheerfulness
since
the
night
at
the
Opera
,
and
he
determine
to
try
what
a
week
's
holiday
would
do
to
raise
his
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
I
perform
the
errand
entrust
to
me
,
and
draw
out
the
necessary
report
,
on
the
fourth
day
from
our
arrival
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
the
fifth
day
I
arrange
to
devote
to
sight
-
see
and
amusement
in
Pesca
's
company
.
  
<EOS>
Our
hotel
have
be
too
full
to
accommodate
us
both
on
the
same
floor
.
<EOS>
My
room
be
on
the
second
story
,
and
Pesca
's
be
above
me
,
on
the
third
.
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
I
go
upstairs
to
see
if
the
Professor
be
ready
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
just
before
I
reach
the
landing
I
see
his
door
open
from
the
inside
 
a
long
,
delicate
,
nervous
hand
(
not
my
friend
's
hand
certainly
)
hold
it
ajar
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
I
hear
Pesca
's
voice
say
eagerly
,
in
low
tone
,
and
in
his
own
language
 
"
I
remember
the
name
,
but
I
do
not
know
the
man
.
<EOS>
You
see
at
the
Opera
<EOS>
he
be
so
change
that
I
could
not

<EOS>
I
will
forward
the
report
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
no

"
<EOS>
"
no
more
need
be
do
,
"
answer
the
second
voice
.
<EOS>
the
door
open
wide
,
and
the
light
-
haired
man
with
the
scar
on
his
cheek
 
<EOS>
the
man
I
have
see
follow
Count
Fosco
's
cab
a
week
before
 
come
out
.
<EOS>
He
bow
as
I
draw
aside
to
let
him
pass
 
<EOS>
his
face
be
fearfully
pale
 
<EOS>
and
he
hold
fast
by
the
banister
as
he
descend
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
I
push
open
the
door
and
enter
Pesca
's
room
.
<EOS>
He
be
crouch
up
,
in
the
strange
manner
,
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
shrink
from
me
when
I
approach
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I

you

I
ask
.
<EOS>
"

he

,
turn
his

the
wall

not

"
  
<EOS>
"
We

not

I
be
afraid

before
the
afternoon

I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
come
out
with
me
in
the
meantime

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I

go
back

day
 
<EOS>
pray
let

go
back

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
leave
him
with
the
assurance
that
he
should
leave
Paris
that
afternoon
.
<EOS>
We
have
arrange
the
evening
before
to
ascend
the
Cathedral
of
Notre
Dame
,
with
Victor
Hugo
's
noble
romance
for
our
guide
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
the
french
capital
that
I
be
more
anxious
to
see
,
and
I
depart
by
myself
for
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
approach
Notre
Dame
by
the
river
-
side
<EOS>
,
I
pass
on
my
way
the
terrible
dead
-
house
of
Paris
 
the
Morgue
.
<EOS>
a
great
crowd
clamour
and
heave
round
the
door
.
<EOS>
there
be
evidently
something
inside
which
excite
the
popular
curiosity
,
and
feed
the
popular
appetite
for
horror
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
walk
on
to
the
church
if
the
conversation
of
two
man
and
a
woman
on
the
outskirt
of
the
crowd
have
not
catch
my
ear
.
<EOS>
They
have
just
come
out
from
see
the
sight
in
the
Morgue
,
and
the
account
they
be
give
of
the
dead
body
to
their
neighbour
describe
it
as
the
corpse
of
a
man
 
a
man
of
immense
size
,
with
a
strange
mark
on
his
left
arm
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
those
word
reach
me
I
stop
and
take
my
place
with
the
crowd
go
in
.
<EOS>
some
dim
foreshadowing
of
the
truth
have
cross
my
mind
when
I
hear
Pesca
's
voice
through
the
open
door
,
and
when
I
see
the
stranger
's
face
as
he
pass
me
on
the
stair
of
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
now
the
truth
itself
be
reveal
to
me
 
reveal
in
the
chance
word
that
have
just
reach
my
ear
.
<EOS>
other
vengeance
than
mine
have
follow
that
fate
man
from
the
theatre
to
his
own
door
 
from
his
own
door
to
his
refuge
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
other
vengeance
than
mine
have
call
him
to
the
day
of
reckoning
,
and
have
exact
from
him
the
penalty
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
the
moment
when
I
have
point
him
out
to
Pesca
at
the
theatre
in
the
hearing
of
that
stranger
by
our
side
,
who
be
look
for
him
too
 
be
the
moment
that
seal
his
doom
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
struggle
in
my
own
heart
,
when
he
and
I
stand
face
to
face
 
the
struggle
before
I
could
let
him
escape
me
 
and
shudder
as
I
recall
it
.
  
<EOS>
slowly
,
inch
by
inch
,
I
press
in
with
the
crowd
,
move
nearer
and
near
to
the
great
glass
screen
that
part
the
dead
from
the
living
at
the
Morgue
 
nearer
and
nearer
,
till
I
be
close
behind
the
front
row
of
spectator
,
and
could
look
in
.
  
<EOS>
there
he
lie
,
unowned
,
unknown
,
expose
to
the
flippant
curiosity
of
a
french
mob
!
<EOS>
there
be
the
dreadful
end
of
that
long
life
of
degraded
ability
and
heartless
crime
!
<EOS>
hush
in
the
sublime
repose
of
death
,
the
broad
,
firm
,
massive
face
and
head
front
us
so
grandly
that
the
chatter
Frenchwomen
about
me
lift
their
hand
in
admiration
,
and
cry
in
shrill
chorus
,
"
ah
,
what
a
handsome
man
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
wound
that
have
kill
him
have
be
strike
with
a
knife
or
dagger
exactly
over
his
heart
.
<EOS>
no
other
trace
of
violence
appear
about
the
body
except
on
the
left
arm
,
and
there
,
exactly
in
the
place
where
I
have
see
the
brand
on
Pesca
's
arm
,
be
two
deep
cut
in
the
shape
of
the
letter
t
,
which
entirely
obliterate
the
mark
of
the
Brotherhood
.
<EOS>
His
clothe
,
hang
above
him
,
show
that
he
have
be
himself
conscious
of
his
danger
 
<EOS>
they
be
clothe
that
have
disguise
him
as
a
french
artisan
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
,
but
not
for
longer
,
I
force
myself
to
see
these
thing
through
the
glass
screen
.
<EOS>
I
can
write
of
them
at
no
great
length
,
for
I
see
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
the
few
fact
in
connection
with
his
death
which
I
subsequently
ascertain
(
partly
from
Pesca
and
partly
from
other
source
)
,
may
be
state
here
before
the
subject
be
dismiss
from
these
page
.
  
<EOS>
His
body
be
take
out
of
the
Seine
in
the
disguise
which
I
have
describe
,
nothing
be
find
on
him
which
reveal
his
name
,
his
rank
,
or
his
place
of
abode
.
<EOS>
the
hand
that
strike
him
be
never
trace
,
and
the
circumstance
under
which
he
be
kill
be
never
discover
.
<EOS>
I
leave
other
to
draw
their
own
conclusion
in
reference
to
the
secret
of
the
assassination
as
I
have
draw
mine
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
intimate
that
the
foreigner
with
the
scar
be
a
member
of
the
Brotherhood
(
admit
in
Italy
after
Pesca
's
departure
from
his
native
country
)
,
and
when
I
have
further
add
that
the
two
cut
,
in
the
form
of
a
t
,
on
the
left
arm
of
the
dead
man
,
signify
the
italian
word
"
Traditore
,
"
and
show
that
justice
have
be
do
by
the
Brotherhood
on
a
traitor
,
I
have
contribute
all
that
I
know
towards
elucidate
the
mystery
of
Count
Fosco
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
the
body

the
day
after
I
have
see
it
by
mean
of
an
anonymous
letter
address
to
his
wife

He

bury
by
Madame
Fosco

<EOS>
not

a
biography
of
her

<EOS>
the
work
throw
no
light
whatever
on
the
name
that
be
really
his
own
or
on
the
secret
history
of
his
life
 
it
be
almost
entirely
devoted
to
the
praise
of
his
domestic
virtue
,
the
assertion
of
his
rare
ability
,
and
the
enumeration
of
the
honour
confer
on
him

<EOS>
the
circumstance
attend
his
death
be
very
briefly
notice
,
and
be
sum
up
on
the
last
page
in
this
sentence
 
<EOS>
"
His
life

one
long
assertion
of
the
right

to
his
cause

and
autumn

after
my

from
Paris

and
bring
no

We
