I.INTRODUCTION
—
<EOS>
the
travelers.a
few
year
since
,
most
of
the
western
States
and
Territories
—
particularly
those
border
upon
the
great
Mississippi
—
be
infest
with
band
of
lawless
desperado
,
collect
from
all
part
of
the
globe
,
who
,
have
become
criminal
in
their
native
land
,
here
seek
an
asylum
,
either
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
entirely
,
or
where
stern
Justice
be
weak
,
be
relax
from
that
severity
which
she
exercise
in
the
more
populous
section
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
here
,
in
many
case
,
they
form
themselves
into
band
,
choose
some
one
of
the
more
bold
and
daring
of
their
party
for
leader
—
their
purpose
,
doubtless
,
be
the
great
facility
of
proceed
in
their
depredation
,
as
well
as
firm
security
against
apprehension
.
<EOS>
but
,
although
,
as
we
have
remark
,
they
form
themselves
into
band
or
party
,
yet
rarely
,
in
fact
we
believe
only
in
extreme
case
,
do
they
openly
act
in
concert
;
their
policy
be
to
conceal
from
their
more
honest
neighbor
the
fact
that
there
be
such
a
regular
organized
combination
of
man
for
outlawry
purpose
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
It
be
their
policy
,
also
,
to
disperse
themselves
throughout
the
country
;
to
meet
only
at
certain
interval
,
and
then
in
secret
,
under
cover
of
night
;
by
which
mean
they
would
appear
as
honest
citizen
;
live
,
many
of
them
,
unsuspecte
,
and
in
all
case
be
among
the
first
to
learn
of
whatever
movement
may
chance
to
be
in
progress
detrimental
to
their
interest
as
a
body
,
or
to
any
member
individually
,
and
thus
be
enable
to
take
measure
to
prevent
,
or
lay
secret
plan
to
counteract
it
.
<EOS>
this
will
,
we
think
,
sufficiently
account
for
their
,
in
many
case
,
long
and
sometimes
undisturbed
career
of
dissipation
and
crime
.
<EOS>
Our
story
open
a
few
year
subsequent
to
the
close
of
the
last
war
with
England
,
and
at
a
period
when
the
interior
of
Missouri
—
the
theatre
of
the
scene
,
incident
and
character
which
be
about
to
follow
—
be
,
comparatively
,
but
little
known
;
in
fact
,
we
believe
we
may
with
propriety
say
,
there
be
portion
within
its
territorial
boundary
at
this
time
unseen
and
untrod
by
the
eye
and
foot
of
the
white
man
.
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
there
be
section
of
it
uninhabite
,
there
be
already
a
tide
of
emigration
set
in
from
the
eastward
,
which
render
it
probable
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
year
,
at
the
farth
,
it
would
not
only
be
fully
explore
,
but
settle
,
by
some
of
the
more
enterprising
and
industrious
inhabitant
of
the
States
lie
east
of
the
great
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
even
now
the
eastern
portion
of
it
be
begin
to
exhibit
sign
of
settlement
and
civilization
,
and
already
the
blue
smoke
arise
from
many
a
cot
which
here
<EOS>
and
there
dot
the
long
line
of
forest
bordering
on
the
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
this
forest
follow
the
winding
of
the
river
and
extend
back
some
fifteen
or
twenty
mile
,
opening
,
in
some
place
,
upon
the
large
and
beautiful
prairie
,
where
the
tall
grass
wave
to
and
fro
in
the
breeze
,
contain
its
legion
of
wild
animal
,
and
where
the
eye
could
range
uninterruptedly
for
mile
on
mile
,
as
over
some
vast
sea
,
until
finally
shut
in
by
the
far
distant
horizon
.
<EOS>
in
some
part
of
this
forest
the
ground
for
mile
be
nearly
level
,
and
only
require
the
removal
of
the
underbrush
to
make
it
a
beautiful
grove
,
while
other
part
be
wild
,
rocky
and
mountainous
,
present
to
the
eye
of
the
beholder
many
grand
and
romantic
scene
,
as
though
Nature
have
design
to
soothe
,
awe
and
display
her
power
by
strong
and
varying
contrast
.
<EOS>
as
before
remark
,
that
region
of
country
know
as
Missouri
,
be
fast
emerge
from
savage
to
civilized
life
—
from
a
gloomy
wilderness
to
the
abode
of
civilization
.
<EOS>
the
axe
may
now
be
hear
in
the
forest
where
,
but
a
few
year
before
,
echo
the
wild
war
-
whoop
of
the
Indian
.
<EOS>
on
the
bank
of
that
rapid
and
mighty
stream
,
from
which
Missouri
take
her
name
,
a
few
regular
settlement
have
spring
up
—
among
the
most
prominent
of
which
we
will
mention
the
old
town
of
Franklin
,
a
place
that
have
long
since
disappear
,
have
be
literally
sweep
away
by
the
eternal
knawing
of
this
river
whose
bed
be
continually
change
.
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
of
Missouri
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
as
must
naturally
be
the
case
in
every
new
settlement
,
be
compose
of
all
class
,
from
the
refined
,
educated
and
intellectual
,
to
the
coarse
,
ignorant
,
demi
-
savage
race
,
which
be
ever
find
to
exist
as
a
kind
of
medium
between
refinement
and
utter
barbarity
.
<EOS>
have
make
these
few
preliminary
remark
,
so
that
the
reader
may
form
an
idea
of
the
then
exist
state
of
the
country
,
we
will
now
at
once
proceed
with
our
story
.
<EOS>
It
be
near
the
close
of
a
hot
sultry
day
,
in
the
summer
of
18
—
,
that
two
traveler
be
slowly
wend
their
way
over
a
wild
and
somewhat
mountainous
tract
of
land
,
some
thirty
mile
distant
and
in
a
south
-
westerly
direction
from
St.
Louis
.
<EOS>
the
elder
of
the
two
be
a
man
<EOS>
about
thirty
-
five
year
of
age
,
whose
height
rather
exceed
six
foot
,
<EOS>
and
although
not
what
may
be
term
of
handsome
proportion
,
yet
of
that
close
knit
and
sinewy
build
which
give
evidence
of
great
muscular
strength
and
a
capability
of
endure
much
hardship
and
fatigue
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
,
which
be
visible
from
his
hat
be
partly
remove
,
be
of
medium
proportion
,
on
one
side
of
which
be
carelessly
part
his
long
raven
colored
hair
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
long
,
thin
and
rather
strongly
mark
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
be
large
,
around
which
play
a
peculiar
smile
which
,
to
convey
an
idea
of
,
we
shall
term
a
philosophical
one
.
<EOS>
His
lip
be
thick
—
cheek
somewhat
hollow
—
nose
long
and
pointed
—
eye
small
and
grey
,
with
a
peculiar
twinkle
in
the
latter
,
when
speak
,
which
lead
one
to
fancy
there
be
more
mean
than
say
—
and
altogether
the
whole
expression
of
his
feature
be
a
combination
of
cunning
,
shrewdness
and
candor
,
mingle
with
a
quiet
,
thoughtful
and
humorous
turn
of
mind
.
<EOS>
in
speech
he
be
very
deliberate
,
and
no
matter
by
what
circumstance
surround
,
would
never
fail
to
give
each
word
its
proper
bearing
.
<EOS>
His
dress
be
a
plain
home
-
spin
suit
of
sheep
's
grey
—
an
article
much
wear
by
the
yeoman
of
that
day
—
and
his
dialect
partook
strongly
of
that
peculiarity
which
distinguish
the
people
of
New
England
—
particularly
those
who
have
little
access
to
society
—
from
almost
every
other
;
and
be
,
besides
,
of
that
uncouth
form
of
speech
,
which
be
engender
from
habit
,
when
not
polish
by
the
refinement
of
education
.
<EOS>
His
companion
be
a
very
different
personage
;
in
fact
,
of
an
entirely
opposite
cast
.
<EOS>
in
year
he
be
some
five
the
other
's
junior
—
some
three
inch
less
in
stature
—
of
a
form
full
of
grace
and
elasticity
—
a
face
almost
round
—
a
complexion
ruddy
—
large
,
restless
grey
eye
—
with
much
hauteur
in
his
bearing
,
and
of
an
active
and
rather
irritable
temperament
.
<EOS>
His
articulation
correspond
with
his
temperament
,
be
quick
and
impetuous
,
and
his
language
give
evidence
of
his
superiority
over
the
other
in
point
of
education
.
<EOS>
His
dress
be
a
plain
suit
of
black
,
a
little
the
bad
for
wear
perhaps
,
but
of
an
excellent
fit
,
which
,
together
with
the
fine
texture
of
the
cloth
,
the
graceful
ease
with
which
it
be
wear
,
have
be
proof
sufficient
the
wearer
be
no
laborer
,
even
be
not
the
soft
white
hand
,
hold
a
light
fancy
cane
,
to
be
take
as
evidence
.
<EOS>
to
some
,
perhaps
,
it
may
appear
singular
that
two
individual
,
so
directly
opposite
in
personal
appearance
,
manner
,
dress
and
temperament
,
should
be
companion
,
and
what
be
more
,
friend
;
yet
such
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
old
adage
that
"
like
cling
to
like
,
"
it
must
be
admit
we
have
a
great
many
exception
,
and
that
like
cling
to
unlike
may
be
say
with
propriety
of
the
social
relation
and
connection
of
mankind
in
general
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
this
process
the
great
string
of
Nature
be
make
to
blend
their
sound
in
harmony
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
as
we
have
say
,
near
the
close
of
the
day
,
and
the
last
ray
of
the
set
sun
have
be
intercept
by
a
thick
,
black
thunder
cloud
,
which
,
approach
rapidly
,
threaten
our
traveler
with
a
heavy
shower
.
<EOS>
for
some
minute
neither
speak
,
but
silently
glance
toward
the
west
,
both
immediately
advanced
from
a
slow
to
a
rapid
pace
.
<EOS>
the
young
be
the
first
to
break
silence
with
the
exclamation
"
<EOS>
ha
!
"
<EOS>
as
a
flash
of
lightning
,
more
vivid
than
any
previous
,
fling
its
red
lurid
glare
over
them
,
and
for
a
moment
seem
to
put
the
forest
in
a
blaze
,
follow
almost
instantaneously
by
a
heavy
crash
of
thunder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
Bernard
,
there
be
no
mistake
that
!
<EOS>
how
far
be
we
now
from
Webber's?""Wal
,
I
should
guess
about
five
mile
,
"
reply
Bernard
.
<EOS>
"five
mile
!
"
echo
the
other
quickly
,
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
Harvey
,
what
be
you
think
about
?
<EOS>
It
be
only
ten
mile
when
we
last
enquire
,
nearly
two
hour
since
,
and
now
you
think
we
have
only
reach
half
way
!
<EOS>
—
Pshaw!""Wal
,
"
remark
Bernard
,
coolly
and
quietly
,
"
this
ere
be
a
free
country
,
and
every
body
be
get
a
right
to
their
own
opinion
<EOS>
any
how
;
and
so
,
as
the
feller
say
,
if
you
do
not
like
the
distance
at
five
mile
,
you
can
have
it
for
any
distance
<EOS>
you
be
a
mind
to
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
a
moment
a
half
angry
smile
play
around
the
mouth
of
the
young
,
as
though
he
would
have
laugh
,
but
be
check
by
some
opposite
feeling
,
while
he
bite
his
nether
lip
and
tap
his
cane
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
with
a
quick
,
nervous
motion
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
well
,
"
rejoin
he
,
quickly
,
"
if
we
have
yet
five
mile
to
travel
,
our
pace
must
be
still
increase
,
for
the
night
gather
<EOS>
fast!""I
calculate
we
would
about
as
well
be
seek
for
a
shelter
,
"
remark
Bernard
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"a
shelter
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
the
other
in
surprise
;
"
surely
you
do
not
dream
of
spend
the
night
in
this
lonely
place?""wal
,
as
to
the
matter
o
'
that
,
"
answer
Bernard
,
"
I
reckon
I
do
not
dream
<EOS>
no
how
,
because
I
be
awake
and
its
a
sartin
thing
;
and
when
a
body
's
awake
and
sartin
,
ye
see
he
be
not
a
dreaming
;
but"—and
he
look
coolly
at
the
other
,
speak
slowly
<EOS>
and
impressively—"if
you
want
to
tell
your
friend
of
your
adventure
,
and
put
this
'
ere
night
in
as
one
of
'em
<EOS>
,
you
haint
get
a
minute
to
lose
'
tween
this
and
the
time
your
head
's
under
something
more
powerful
to
protect
it
than
that
be
beaver
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
what
mean
you
?
"
cry
the
other
,
turn
somewhat
pale
.
<EOS>
"D'ye
see
that
be
cloud
?
"
say
Bernard
,
elevate
his
finger
to
an
angle
of
some
forty
-
five
degree
;
"
now
mark
all
the
twist
in't
,
and
keep
tally
for
about
a
minute
all
them
be
streak
o
'
lightning
dance
up
and
down
,
and
I
reckon
you
will
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
safe
place
for
Marcus
Tyrone
do
not
lay
in
the
open
air
by
any
mean
.
<EOS>
""Ay
!
<EOS>
true
,
true
!
"
return
Tyrone
,
with
a
start
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
Bernard
,
right
;
for
there
be
something
awful
in
yonder
cloud
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
to
be
do
?
<EOS>
We
can
reach
no
habitation
,
and
to
remain
here
be
,
<EOS>
I
fear
,
but
to
expose
ourselves
to
certain
death
!
<EOS>
Can
we
not
find
shelter
under
some
of
these
rocks?""Why
,
ye
see
,
Mark
,
I
will
jest
tell
ye
<EOS>
how
'
tis
,
"
answer
Bernard
.
<EOS>
"
if
we
do
not
find
some
place
to
git
our
head
under
soon
,
its
my
opinion
<EOS>
they
will
not
be
no
further
use

for
that

storm

not

us

return
Tyrone
,
his
feature
become
a
shade
more
pale
;
and
follow
Bernard
,
he
proceed
directly
towards
the
spot
designate
;
though
,
perhaps
,
with
feeling
less
at
ease
than
he
would
have
his
companion
imagine
.
<EOS>
the
cave
allude
to
,
be
situate
near
the
brow
of
a
steep
,
rocky
hill
or
bluff
,
some
several
rod
distant
to
the
left
of
the
road
,
which
our
traveler
have
just
quit
,
and
appear
to
have
be
form
by
some
great
convulsion
of
nature
,
in
the
rend
and
upheaving
of
rock
,
which
have
fall
together
so
as
to
leave
a
cavity
sufficiently
large
to
contain
several
person
.
<EOS>
the
mouth
of
this
cave
front
the
south
,
and
overlook
the
beautiful
Maramee
,
which
roll
sparkle
along
some
fifty
yard
below
,
and
be
surround
by
scenery
romantic
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
the
hill
on
which
it
stand
be
a
portion
of
a
ridge
which
extend
in
an
irregular
line
far
away
to
the
southwest
and
northeast
.
<EOS>
immediately
above
and
below
this
cave
be
large
projecting
rock
,
which
,
to
all
appearance
,
be
so
slightly
bed
in
the
earth
,
that
<EOS>
but
little
force
be
necessary
to
send
them
thunder
to
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
a
dwarfish
growth
of
shrub
-
oak
have
struggle
up
between
them
,
and
present
their
rough
,
shaggy
top
above
,
as
though
to
give
the
scene
an
air
of
wildness
and
desolation
.
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
this
,
there
be
a
fine
redeem
trait
in
the
surround
scenery
—
view
from
the
brow
of
the
hill
—
whose
beauty
be
heighten
by
contrast
the
most
pleasing
.
<EOS>
at
its
base
on
the
western
side
,
be
a
finely
timbere
forest
,
stretch
far
away
northward
,
and
finally
open
upon
a
beautiful
strip
of
meadow
or
prairie
land
,
over
which
the
eye
may
wander
for
mile
,
to
rest
at
last
upon
a
blue
hazy
ridge
of
mountain
in
the
distance
.
<EOS>
the
view
towards
the
east
and
south
be
not
so
extensive
,
but
this
likewise
have
its
attraction
.
<EOS>
a
distant
perspective
be
cut
off
by
another
ridge
,
run
almost
parallel
to
the
one
just
describe
;
but
the
loss
be
amply
compensate
,
by
the
wild
picturesque
scenery
present
,
and
the
gentle
murmur
which
steal
sweetly
upon
the
ear
,
as
the
Maramee
send
its
water
foam
and
dash
over
its
rocky
bed
between
,
anon
to
glance
off
into
a
still
silvery
belt
and
for
a
time
mirror
surrounding
object
ere
forever
lose
in
the
bosom
of
the
mighty
Mississippi
.
<EOS>
the
road
of
which
mention
have
already
be
make
—
though
it
would
,
perhaps
,
poorly
compare
with
some
of
the
present
day
—
be
,
for
this
period
and
section
of
country
,
uncommonly
good
—
be
mostly
clear
of
stone
,
stump
,
brush
and
the
like
—
so
that
a
skilful
horseman
may
dash
rapidly
over
it
with
little
danger
of
life
or
limb
.
<EOS>
to
the
eastward
it
follow
the
winding
of
the
Maramee
,
for
some
considerable
distance
,
through
a
thick
,
dark
ravine
,
and
then
branch
off
through
a
level
and
extensive
forest
.
<EOS>
as
light
one
horse
vehicle
be
not
in
use
at
this
period
,
and
more
especially
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
the
horse
be
ride
instead
by
those
who
prefer
an
easy
and
more
speedy
locomotion
than
walk
,
and
in
consequence
every
settler
of
note
be
supply
with
a
number
of
these
noble
animal
,
for
the
use
of
himself
and
family
.
<EOS>
but
we
fear
the
reader
will
think
us
digress
,
and
so
let
us
return
to
our
traveler

chapter
ii.the
STORM
—
<EOS>
the
KIDNAPPERS.Although
Bernard
approach
the
cave
with
a
firm
step
,
apparently
indifferent
as
to
what
may
be
therein
conceal
,
yet
it
must
be
admit
there
be
feeling
within
his
breast
strangely
at
variance
with
his
calm
,
unmoved
exterior
.
<EOS>
twice
he
seem
on
the
point
of
come
to
a
halt
,
but
then
,
as
though
actuate
by
some
counteracting
feeling
,
he
stride
steadily
onward
,
and
be
soon
stand
at
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
fast
grow
dark
,
for
the
come
storm
have
considerably
advance
the
night
,
and
although
the
sun
have
barely
set
,
object
at
<EOS>
but
a
little
distance
appear
dim
and
indistinct
,
save
when
throw
into
bold
relief
,
for
a
moment
,
by
some
vivid
flash
of
lightning
,
when
,
as
if
to
repair
the
error
,
they
apparently
sink
into
a
deep
gloom
than
ever
.
<EOS>
cast
a
hasty
glance
behind
him
,
and
perceive
his
companion
close
at
hand
,
Bernard
motion
him
to
silence
,
and
have
cautiously
begin
his
entrance
,
when
a
hurried
exclamation
from
the
other
cause
him
to
look
around
,
and
see
him
gaze
steadily
towards
the
west
,
he
turn
his
eye
in
that
direction
,
and
soon
become
transfixed
as
though
by
a
spell
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
remark
it
be
grow
dark
,
but
below
the
gloom
have
deepen
into
night
,
which
lie
like
a
pall
along
the
valley
,
into
which
even
the
lightning
,
as
it
play
along
the
top
of
the
tree
with
a
lurid
glare
,
seem
unable
to
penetrate
.
<EOS>
but
the
scene
higher
up
be
what
have
catch
and
rivet
the
attention
of
our
traveler
.
<EOS>
just
over
the
summit
of
another
hill
,
towards
the
west
,
be
a
white
misty
streak
,
which
lie
spread
along
the
horizon
,
like
in
appearance
a
bank
of
snow
see
through
a
fog
,
above
which
awful
black
cloud
be
roll
,
and
tumbling
,
and
twist
themselves
into
the
most
angry
shape
possible
—
belch
forth
their
fork
tongue
of
lightning
—
seem
like
some
dark
and
mighty
spirit
of
the
etherial
,
enrage
,
and
charge
with
all
Heaven
's
artillery
against
this
nether
world
.
<EOS>
during
the
interval
between
each
clap
of
thunder
,
a
roaring
sound
,
like
that
of
some
distant
waterfall
,
be
bear
to
the
ear
of
the
traveler
with
a
startling
distinctness
,
gradually
increase
each
moment
,
until
it
sound
like
the
roll
of
an
hundred
drum
.
<EOS>
during
this
brief
space
—
for
brief
indeed
it
be
—
not
a
twig
be
see
to
move
—
not
a
leaf
to
stir
—
but
all
,
all
be
motionless
,
us
though
Nature
be
hold
her
breath
in
awe
of
some
great
and
mighty
convulsion
.
<EOS>
the
air
feel
hot
,
thick
and
oppressive
,
as
from
the
breath
of
an
evil
spirit
.
<EOS>
suddenly
the
tree
on
the
other
hill
become
dreadfully
agitate
—
bow
their
head
,
and
writhing
,
and
twist
themselves
into
all
manner
of
shape
possible
,
while
a
dark
misty
shadow
creep
,
or
rather
sweep
along
,
and
bury
them
in
terrible
night
.
<EOS>
thus
it
appear
to
our
traveler
,
who
,
warn
by
this
and
a
few
heavy
drop
of
rain
,
now
eagerly
seek
their
shelter
;
Bernard
,
as
previously
,
take
the
precedence
.
<EOS>
move
cautiously
forward
,
after
enter
the
mouth
of
the
cave
—
for
caution
be
a
part
of
his
nature
—
he
presently
gain
the
interior
,
where
he
be
immediately
join
by
his
companion
.
<EOS>
a
flash
of
lightning
at
this
moment
discover
to
our
traveller
that
they
be
the
only
occupant
of
the
cave
,
when
something
like
a
sigh
from
Bernard
,
and
the
ejaculation
of
"
thank
God
!
"
<EOS>
from
Tyrone
,
attest
the
relief
feel
by
both
.
<EOS>
"I

Bernard
,

be
the
first

<EOS>

Tyrone

<EOS>

<EOS>
I

I
do

""Indeed

"Wal

the
remainder
of
the
sentence
,
if
speak
,
be
drown
in
a
terrible
crash
of
thunder
,
that
shake
the
ground
beneath
them
,
and
cause
both
the
speaker
and
his
companion
to
start
involuntarily
.
<EOS>
during
the
conversation
just
record
,
the
storm
have
be
rush
on
with
all
the
wild
fury
of
a
tornado
,
and
now
come
sweep
down
the
opposite
hill
—
tear
along
through
the
valley
—
up
the
hill
—
dash
against
the
cave

as
though
to
rend
it
asunder

snap

up

<EOS>
for
some
half
hour
our
traveler
stand
mute
—
awed
to
silence
by
the
raging
of
the
element

gaze
forth
through

add
he
,
as
a

for
a
moment
<EOS>
blind
him
,
and
a
peal
of
thunder
shake
the
cave

<EOS>
for
some
minute
his
companion
make
no
reply
,
and
then
in
a
complaining
,
petulent
tone
say
:
"
be
there
ever
any

so
unlucky

<EOS>
only
to

force
to

so
near

declare
it
vex
me

""Hello

cry
Bernard

You
be
the

queerest
chap

ever

one
minute
all
thankfulness

the
next
all
grumble

do
not
ye
larn
a
little
patience

a
body'd
think
when

you

would'nt
,
in

set
up

an

at

""well

well

Bernard
,
say
no
more

reply
Tyrone
,
in
a
voice
of
contrition
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
my
hasty
,
impatient
nature
,
and
must
overlook
my
language
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
wrong
in
me
to
complain
;
but
I
have
set
my
heart
so
much
on
reach
Webber
's
to
-
night
,
that
it
seem
hard
to
relinquish
the
design
.
<EOS>
""Now
<EOS>
you
speak
a
little
more
sensible
like
,
"
rejoin
Bernard
;
"
and
as
to
gitte
to
Webber
's
,
I
guess
we
will
be
able
to
do
it
<EOS>
yit
.
<EOS>
the
moon
will
be
up
in
about
an
hour
,
and
I
reckon
this
ere
storm
will
clear
away
by
that
time
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
Bernard
be
right
.
<EOS>
in
an
hour
the
storm
have
pass
on
to
the
east
,
leave
behind
it
a
few
broken
,
scattered
cloud
,
sail
lazily
through
the
air
—
above
which
Heaven
's
diamond
gleam
and
sparkle
—
now
hide
from
the
sight
,
now
shine
out
merrily
—
while
the
far
off
flash
and
distant
rumble
betoken
the
storm
still
speed
on
in
its
fury
.
<EOS>
Anon
the
moon
arise
,
slowly
and
majestically
,
to
pour
her
silvery
flood
of
light
upon
the
scene
,
while
here
and
there
a
modest
stardrew
back
from
Luna
's
ray
,
yet
shine
in
its
realm
afar
,
perchance
the
queen
of
day
.
<EOS>
Our
traveler
,
now
that
the
storm
be
pass
and
moon
rise
,
deem
it
expedient
to
resume
their
journey
,
emerge
at
once
from
the
cave
,
and
have
advance
a
few
pace
towards
the
road
,
when
their
attention
and
progress
be
arrest
by
the
sound
of
voice
in
conversation
.
<EOS>
at
first
the
sound
be
indistinct
,
but
gradually
they
seem
to
grow
louder
,
denote
thereby
the
approach
of
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
at
length
they
descry
two
figure
descend
the
hill
,
and
instantly
crouch
behind
a
rock
,
be
enable
to
overhear
a
few
sentence
as
they
pass
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not

a

"Why

they
be
come

so

here
the
conversation
become
so
indistinct
that
our
traveler
could
make
out
nothing
further
,
save
the
word
"
pistol
,
"
which
occur
shortly
after
;
but
enough
have
be
glean
to
denote
foul
play
,
and
simultaneously
grasp
their
weapon
,
both
advance
cautiously
in
the
direction

by
the

even
on
the

of

and
the
ravine
below
still
lie
in
the
gloomy
repose
of
solitude
and
darkness
.
<EOS>
glide
quickly
forward
,
but
at
the

time
as
stealthily
as
possible
,
our
traveler
soon
gain
sufficient
on
the
ruffian
to
enable
them
to
see
their
dusky
form
,
and
overhear
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
foremost
two
come
to
a
halt
,
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
just
where
you
enter
the
ravine
already
mention
,
and
separating

take
his
station
opposite

on

attack
upon

must
necessarily
pass
within

<EOS>
ensconse
themselves
behind
some
bush
,
which
grow
by
the
way
side
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
await
in
anxious
suspense
the
moment
when
they
would

probably

in

call
into
action
of
no

<EOS>
for

all
be

CHAPTER
III.THE
lover
—
the
warning
—
<EOS>
the
CAPTURE.We
must
now
go
back
in
our
narrative
,
to
a
short
time
previous
to
its
opening
in
the
first
chapter
.
<EOS>
on
the
same
road
already
mention
as
lead
on
through
the
ravine
,
about
ten
mile
to
the
northeast
of
the
place
describe
in
the
foregoing
chapter
,
and
on
the
same
day
the
event
just
record
take
place
,
be
two
personage
,
well
mount
on
a
couple
of
beautiful
horse
,
ride
along
at
a
leisure
pace
.
<EOS>
of
the
two
,
one
be
a
young
man
,
apparently
about
twenty
year
of
age
,
of
a
fine
form
and
manly
bear
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
be
well
shape
,
open
,
frank
and
noble
,
and
of
a
high
intellectual
cast
;
while
his
bright
,
hazel
eye
sparkle
with
a
true
poetic
expression
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
be
smooth
,
broad
and
high
,
surmount
by
dark
brown
hair
,
which
hang
in
graceful
curl
far
down
his
neck
,
give
to
him
a
somewhat
feminine
,
though
not
unplease
,
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
be
well
dressed
—
uncommonly
so
for
this
section
of
the
country
—
in
a
fine
suit
of
black
;
the
low
extremity
of
his
pantaloon
be
encase
in
fine
buckskin
leggin
,
while
his
head
be
cover
by
a
beautiful
cap
of
dark
silk
velvet
,
on
either
side
of
which
a
couple
of
gold
mount
button
shine
conspicuously
.
<EOS>
He
ride
his
high
mettle
steed
in
that
easy
,
graceful
,
dignified
manner
,
which
set
forth
the
rider
to
so
much
advantage
,
and
which
be
only
acquire
by
constant
practice
,
together
with
a
knowledge
of
the
rule
of
horsemanship
.
<EOS>
His
companion
be
a
female
,
elegantly
attire
in
a
riding
suit
,
and
likewise
ride
very
gracefully
.
<EOS>
of
year
she
have
see
some
eighteen
,
be
medium
in
stature
,
and
beautifully
form
.
<EOS>
Her
countenance
,
strictly
speak
,
could
scarce
be
account
ed
handsome
,
for
her
feature
be
not
entirely
regular
;
yet
there
be
something
so
noble
,
so
intelligent
in
the
expression
,
her
dark
blue
eye
be
so
light
up
with
the
fire
of
an
earnest
soul
,
that
ten
to
one
you
would
pronounce
her
beautiful
,
ere
<EOS>
the
form
of
her
feature
be
distinctly
recognise
;
thus
unconsciously
award
another
proof
of
the
mind
's
immortal
triumph
over
matter
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
be
a
glossy
auburn
,
the
front
of
which
be
neatly
braid
,
bring
down
with
a
graceful
curve
below
her
ear
,
and
fasten
behind
.
<EOS>
Her
check
be
slightly
dimple
,
and
around
her
mouth
linger
one
of
those
pleasing
expression
—
a
sort
of
half
smile
—
which
,
combine
with
a
bright
flashing
eye
,
invariably
win
upon
the
beholder
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
lead
us
to
fancy
<EOS>
there
be
an
influence
of
a
mesmeric
nature
connect
therewith
.
<EOS>
the
country
through
which
the
two
be
travel
,
be
mostly
level
,
and
heavily
shade
by
thick
,
dark
wood
,
stretch
far
away
on
either
hand
,
occasionally
break
a
little
in
place
by
the
clearing
up
of
some
settler
,
whereby
the
beam
of
the
sun
pour
gently
in
,
refresh
to
the
eye
of
civilization
,
as
the
cool
spring
of
water
to
the
thirsty
traveler
of
the
Arabian
Desert
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
exceedingly
warm
day
,
and
the
traveler
would
have
suffer
much
,
have
they
not
be
so
well
protect
from
the
ray
of
the
sun
,
which
already
far
advanced
toward
the
western
horizon
,
throw
the
shade
of
the
lofty
tree
directly
across
their
path
.
<EOS>
still
the
air
be
hot
and
sultry
,
unaccompanied
by
any
cool
breeze
,
and
although
jog
along
at
a
very
moderate
pace
,
both
horse
and
rider
perspire
freely
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
how
refreshing
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
the
lady
,
as
a
cool
breeze
fan
for
an
instant
her
heated
brow
,
rustle
the
leave
with
that
pleasing
sound
so
delightful
in
a
forest
.
<EOS>
"
see
,
even
my
noble
Fanny
prick
up
her
ear
,
and
seem
greatly
rejoice
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
and
so
do
Sir
Harry

"
return
her
companion

<EOS>
"
It
be
delightful
truly
,
after
this
intense
and
almost
suffocate
heat
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
it
die
away
again

I

continue

with
a
meaning
smile

gracefully
bow
to
the
lady

<EOS>
"Ay
<EOS>
,
that
indeed
!
<EOS>
well
put
in
,
Sir
Knight
!
<EOS>
but
a
little
late
withal

<EOS>
however
,
better
late
than
never

say
the
adage
,
and
I
trust
you
will
be
a
little
more
circumspect
of
speech
hereafter

<EOS>
""I
will
do
any
thing
you
require

Emily

return
Edward
gallantly
;
"
you
have
only
to
command
to
be
obey

<EOS>
""Indeed
,
Sir
Knight
!
<EOS>
you
be
very
proficient
in
promise
;
you
have
yield
to
a
hard
task
-
master
,
and
I
fear
me
if
put
to
the
test
,
your
action
would
much
belie
your
word
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
indeed
,
Emily
,
you
be
in
error
;
only
give
me
the
trial
,
and
see
if
I
do
not
produce
the
proof
.
<EOS>
""well
,
sir
,
since
you
require
it
,
please
ride
forward

announce
to
the
good
inhabitant

if
you
should
chance
to
meet
any
—
that
a

in
the

of
Emily
Novance

gallant
by

go
before
as
a

—
what
?
<EOS>
you
hesitate
!
<EOS>
be
this
the
way
I
be
to
be

<EOS>
go
,
sir

<EOS>
it
be
my
command!""nay
,
but
Emily
,
this
be
unfair

<EOS>
""So
,
then
,
you
question
my
order
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
I
fear
you
be
like
all
the
rest
of
your
sex
—
full
of
promise
,
which
doubtless
you
all
fulfil
,
when
the
fulfilment
prove
agreeable
to
yourself
;
but
<EOS>
when
otherwise
,
ah
me
!
<EOS>
for
our
sex
;
"
and
the
speaker
shake
her
head
with
an
arch
look
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
,
now
,
Emily
;
but
I
see
you
be
determined
to
carry
the
point
your
own
way
,
so
I
will
fain
give
in
,
lest
I
get
worst
by
argument

<EOS>
""Ay
,
do
if
you
please
,
Sir
Knight

you
will
oblige
me
much

very
much

"For
<EOS>
some
minute
after
this
both
ride
along
in
silence
,
when
the
conversation
be
again
open
by
Edward
.
<EOS>
"I
say
,
Emily

"
begin
he

at
length

to
one
of
your
refined
taste

not

so

,
so
solitary

in
the
wood
as
it
be

seem
very
irksome

methink
to
one
of
your
light
turn
of
mind
,
that
have
be
use
to
the
gay
crowd
which
throng
the
city

it
must
be
very
tiresome

full
of
sameness

cause
ennvi
and
discontent

""Indeed
!

exclaim
the
lady

a
slight
flush

her
fair
noble
feature

her
eye
sparkle
with
more
than
wonte
brilliancy

"
<EOS>
indeed
!
<EOS>
think
you
so
?
<EOS>
then
have
I
give
you
more
credit
for
discernment
than
you
really
possess
,
if
thus
you
judge
the
heart
of
Emily
Nevance

<EOS>
what
be
the
gay
crowd
of
the
city

of
which
you
speak

<EOS>
of
what
be
they
compose
,
but
of
fop
and
fool
—
ape
of
fashion
—
walk
advertisement
for
tailor

milliner
—
whose
mirror
be
their
prophet

and
themselves
the
only
God

worship!—whose

soul
be
confine
within
the
trapping
of
dress
,

know
as
little
of
what
human
being
should
be

as

do
you

for

<EOS>
no

give
me
Nature
in

away
from
the
haunt
of

let
me
contemplate
her
in
silence

in
awe

<EOS>
Tis
then
,
far
from
loncliness
,
I
feel
I
hold
communion
with
the
All
Pervading
Spirit

<EOS>
I
look
around
me

behold
the
work

compare
with

I
sink
into
utter
insignificance

<EOS>
ay

<EOS>
away
with
dusty

with

""Spoken

exclaim
Edward

with

enthusiastic

within
more
eloquently

this
be

in

almost
mournful

,
Edward

you

me
wrong

I
be
not
deaf

your

from
it

I
in

<EOS>
Edward

as
I
tell
you
before

we
be
both
as

I
would
rather

then
,
Edward

you

"For
<EOS>
some
minute
Edward

muse
thoughtfully
,
before

a
reply

<EOS>
He
know
that
Emily
be
correct
in
her
surmise
,
for
his
parent
be
both
rich
and
proud
—
his
father
more
especially
—
and
he
know
too
that
the
latter
,
in
his
own

have
already
dispose
of
his
hand
,
to
one
he
have
never
seem
,
simply
because
she
be
a
personage
of
wealth
;
and
consequently
,
that
it
would
be
a
difficult
matter
,
even
if
do
at
all
,
to
gain
their
consent
to
his
union
with
another
,
and
furthermore
too
,
when
that
other
be
poor
;
but
still
he
love
Emily
sincerely
,
deeply
,
and
be
fully
determined
not
to
sacrifice
his
own
happiness
to
gratify
the
caprice
of
other

even
be
those
other
his
parent

<EOS>
"Well
<EOS>
,
Emily

"
he
at
length

"
depend
upon
it
,
whatever
my

may
think

my
view

at

unaltered

since
you

live

cautiously

"Why

<EOS>

something

I

foreboding

""O

the

"They

no

as
if
to
shake
off
his

the
attempt
end
in
a
hollow
tone

that
sound
strange

unnatural

Edward

there
be
more

now

we
shall
leave
this

"
what
more
she
would
have
add
be
interrupt
by
a
scream
,
as
two
figure
,
spring
from
either
side
of
the
path
,
grasp
the
bridle
of
both
Edward

horse

her
own
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
Emily
feel
herself
seize
by
one
of
the
raffians
,
who
instantly
mount
behind
her
—
see
her
companion
fell
to
the
ground
—
see
two
more
figure
rush
forward
—
hear
the
report
of
a
pistol
—
a
groan
,
and
utter
another
wild
scream
of
fear
and
despair
,
she
be
rapidly
bear
away
into
the
dark
ravine
.
<EOS>
in
the
execution
of
this
nefarious
design
,
Curdish
be
less
successful
than
Riley
;
for
have
strike
Edward
from
his
horse
,
and
just
as
his
foot
be
place
in
the
stirrup
to
mount

a
shot
from
the
pistol
of
Bernard
disable
him

<EOS>
at
this
juncture

recover
from

the
blow

spring
to

learn
from
Tyrone
how
matter

in

agitated
voice

emotion

some

CHAPTER
IV.THE
PURSUIT
—
<EOS>
the
information
—
<EOS>
the
MYSTERIOUS
STRANGERS.Wild
and
turbulent
as
the
water
that
rush
along
by
his
side
,
be
the
thought
and
feeling
crowd
the
breast
of
Edward
Merton
,
as
he
spur
his
noble
animal
on
through
the
ravine
.
<EOS>
His
mind
be
now
a
perfect
chaos
,
where
hope
and
fear
,
love
and
revenge
,
be
alternately
struggle
for
the
mastery
.
<EOS>
one
thought
,
however
,
be
ever
uppermost
:
Emily
Nevance
must
be
rescue
;
but
as
to
the
manner
time
and
place
,
he
scarcely
give
a
thought
;
for
amid
the
whirlwind
of
idea
crowd
his
brain
,
there
be
none
of
calm
delit
ration
,
so
essential
to
the
effecting
of
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
as
he
clear
the
ravine
and
enter
the
forest
,
he
be
very
forcibly
remind
of
his
headlong
speed
,
by
the
stumbling
of
his
horse
against
a
tree
that
have
be
blow
partly
across
the
road
,
by
which
he
be
nearly
throw
to
the
earth
.
<EOS>
immediately
dismount
,
and
find
his
horse
not
materially
injure
—
have
only
in
one
or
two
place
slightly
rupture
the
skin
—
Merton
seat
himself
upon
the
fall
tree
,
and
for
a
few
minute
seem
to
hold
a
consultation
with
himself
.
<EOS>
whatever
this
consultation
be
,
it
probably
savor
more
of
reason
than
his
former
transaction
;
for
on
remount
he
proceed
at
a
much
slow
pace
,
his
mind
evidently
occupy
with
matter
which
at
first
have
be
overlook
.
<EOS>
"yes
<EOS>
,
she
must
be
save
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
he
,
at
length
,
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
how
be
this
to
be
do
?
<EOS>
where
can
I
find
her
?
<EOS>
for
what
purpose
be
she
thus
take
away
?
<EOS>
doubtless
for
some
foul
end
!
<EOS>
oh
God
!
<EOS>
if
she
but
come
to
harm
—
but
no
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
think
it
—
<EOS>
it
must
not
,
shall
not
be!—and
yet
,
and
<EOS>
yet
,
if
it
should
be"—and
Edward
press
his
hand
to
his
throbbing
,
burn
temple
,
in
an
agony
of
mind
almost
insupportable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
the
villain
!
<EOS>
if
he
do
but
wrong
her
,
I
swear
his
heart
's
blood
shall
answer
for
it
,
though
I
spend
a
life
in
search
for
him
!
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
idle
here
,
when
perhaps
I
may
overtake
the
ruffian
—
may
save
her
from
death
,
or
what
be
bad
,
dishonor
?
<EOS>
god
!
<EOS>
if
he
wrong
her
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
speak
,
Merton
bury
the
rowel
in
the
flank
of
the
gallant
horse
which
bear
him
,
and
again
he
be
wildly
dash
forward
,
seemingly
forgetful
of
the
former
accident
.
<EOS>
but
he
remain
unharmed
,
and
a
few
minute
hard
riding
bring
him
to
the
cot
which
have
protect
him
from
the
storm
,
when
,
as
if
strike
by
a
sudden
thought
,
he
ejaculate
,
"
ha
!
<EOS>
I
will
know
,
"
and
immediately
rein
in
his
noble
beast
,
already
cover
with
foam
,
close
to
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
a
loud
hallo
not
serve
to
bring
any
one
to
the
door
,
he
spring
to
the
ground
and
for
some
time
vigorously
apply
his
fist
to
it
with
no
well
success
.
<EOS>
as
he
be
about
to
remount
,
however
,
think
there
be
no
one
within
,
the
sound
of
smothered
voice
catch
his
ear
and
determine
him
to
continue
.
<EOS>
His
effort
be
at
last
reward
by
a
somewhat
husky
voice
call
out:"Who
's
thar'?""a
friend
!
"
reply
Merton
.
<EOS>
"what
<EOS>

"Here

unbolted

cautiously

<EOS>

husky

"I

"When

something
in

would
do

however
.
<EOS>
a
dark
shade
suddenly
flit
across
his
forehead
;
his
eye
shoot
forth
strange
,
savage
gleam
;
his
lip
quiver
,
as
he
attempt
to
compress
them
over
his
almost
toothless
gum
,
and
he
bend
on
Emily
a
look
so
full
of
the
expression
of
a
fiend
,
that
she
feel
her
eye
quail
,
while
the
blood
recede
to
her
heart
and
a
tremor
of
secret
terror
run
throughout
her
system
.
<EOS>
apply
the
ivory
to
his
lip
,
the
Jew
give
a
peculiar
whistle
,
which
be
immediately
answer
from
without
.
<EOS>
a
minute
later
,
two
figure
enter
the
doorway
;
and
ere
Emily
have
fairly
comprehend
what
be
go
forward
,
she
find
herself
pinion
in
the
grasp
of
two
ruffian
.
<EOS>
"Oh

<EOS>
"
exclaim
she
,
"
all
be
lose
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
utter
a
heart
-
pierce
scream
.
<EOS>
the
Jew
chuckle
merrily
,
and
advance
toward
her
,
until
she
feel
his
very
breath
on
her
face
,
said:"you
look
very
mush
more
pootish
;
"
and
he
attempt
to
press
his
loathsome
lip
against
her
face
.
<EOS>
recoil
as
much
as
lie
in
her
power
—
each
wrist
be
grasp
by
the
strong
arm
of
a
man
—
Emily
manage
to
evade
what
she
would
have
suffer
death
sooner
than
permit
,
a
kiss
from
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
she
think
of
Edward
,
and
scarcely
know
why
,
she
call
upon
his
name
for
help
.
"Vot
<EOS>
for

call
?
"
chuckle
the
Jew
.
"
<EOS>
Mistoor
Edwards
vill

a
lie

<EOS>
"
utter
a
deep
,
manly
voice
,
that
make
Emily
scream
for
joy
,
as
the
figure
of
a
man
spring
quickly
forward
,
a
pistol
in
either
hand
,
still
exclaiming:—"back
,
fiend
of
hell
!
<EOS>
back
!
<EOS>
ere
<EOS>
I
send
a
bullet
through
your
brain

"
<EOS>
and
the
next
instant
Emily
be
clasp
in
the
arm
of
Edward
Merton
,
who
press
her
to
his
bosom
with
all
the
wild
foundness
of
a
first
passionate
love
.
<EOS>
after
leave
Merton
in
the
previous
chapter
,
he
have
ride
quickly
forward
,
but
have
be
somewhat
delay
,
as
the
exact
location
of
the
old
hut
be
unknown
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
secure
his
horse
at
a
short
distance
,
and
be
search
along
the
bank
of
the
river
,
assist
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
which
pour
down
her
silvery
flood
of
light
,
give
to
each
thing
a
calm
and
pleasing
effect
—
when
the
scream
of
Emily
arrest
his
attention
,
effectually
enable
him
to
find
the
house
;
which
be
completely
surround
by
tree
and
bush
,
have
thus
far
elude
his
observation
.
<EOS>
instantly
spring
forward
,
he
reach
the
entrance
just
in
time
to
hear
the
voice
of
her
he
love
,
in
tone
that
go
to
his
very
soul
,
call
on
him
for
help
,
and
the
taunting
reply
of
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
mad
,
almost
,
with
hope
,
rage
and
fear
combine
,
he
enter
as
describe
;
but
so
suddenly
,
and
unexpectedly
,
that
the
ruffian
relax
their
hold
and
retreat
to
the
farther
side
of
the
apartment
;
while
the
Jew
,
not
know
what
he
have
to
fear
,
stand
tremble
with
very
fright
.
<EOS>
see
there
be
but
one
,
however
,
he
somewhat
recover
,
exclaiming:"vy

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
cry
Merton
,
spring
in
front
of
Emily
.
"
<EOS>
and
as
for
you
,
old
dastardly
cutthroat
!
"
continue
he
,
turn
to
David
,
as
the
ruffian
paused—"I
have
a
word
to
say
,
which
you
will
do
well
to
heed
!
<EOS>
this
girl
I
demand
by
virtue
of
this
ring
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
speak
,
he
present
the
one
give
him
by
Barton
.
<EOS>
whether
Merton
expect
this
to
have
any
effect
on
the
Jew
or
not
,
certain
it
be
that
he
be
very
much
surprised
at
the
singular
change
it
do
effect
;
for
the
Jew
instantly
advance
in
a
fawning
manner
,
while
the
ruffian
slink
quietly
away
.
<EOS>
content
that
his
purpose
be
gain
,
without
seek
the
mysterious
cause
,
Merton
,
accompany
by
Emily
,
quit
the
hovel
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
the
Jew
follow
them
to
the
door
,
whisper
them
a
good
night
,
pleasant
journey
and
so
forth
,
and
even
go
so
far
as
to
offer
his
service
as
a
guide
,
which
of
course
be
decline
.
<EOS>
as
Merton
enter
the
bush
,
he
look
back
and
see
the
Jew
stand
in
the
doorway
,
his
face
upturne
as
though
gaze
at
the
star
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
a
cloud
which
have
obseure
the
ray
of
the
moon
pass
,
and
the
light
stream
full
upon
his
countenance
,
exhibit
feature
so
work
up
in
expression
with
all
that
be
dark
,
treacherous
and
devilish
,
that
in
Merton
's
estimation
the
owner
be
well
worthy
to
become
the
master
fiend
of
hell
itself
.
<EOS>
a
short
walk
of
a
few
minute
bring
them
to
the
spot
where
Merton
have
leave
his
horse
,
when
to
the
surprise
of
both
,
they
find
the
one
Emily
have
ride
standing
along
side
.
<EOS>
Merton
account
for
this
by
suppose
that
the
kidnapper
,
either
forgetting
,
or
not
have
any
further
use
,
have
leave
her
at
liberty
,
when
attract
by
the
neighing
of
Sir
Harry
she
have
seek
him
out
.
<EOS>
assist
Emily
to
mount
,
he
be
soon
once
more
astride
his
own
fine
steed
;
and
move
away
with
lighten
heart
,
they
be
shortly
traverse
a
path
which
lead
on
toward
Webber
's
,
engage
in
mutual
explanation
of
what
have
occur
to
each
in
the
other
absence
;
and
if
in
do
so
,
Merton
do
ride
a
little
closer
to
the
side
of
Emily
than
be
actually
necessary
—
and
if
when
the
moon
shine
full
on
her
fair
countenance
,
he
do
bend
forward
and
gaze
thereon
with
a
look
of
fondness
that
tell
of
holy
love
,
drink
in
the
glance
of
her
dark
blue
eye
—
and
if
in
attempt
to
lay
hold
of
her
bridle
-
rein
,
to
guide
her
horse
in
the
well
path
,
he
sometimes
touch
her
hand
,
press
it
within
his
own
,
and
whisper
word
so
soft
and
low
<EOS>
the
very
zephyrs
could
not
catch
their
import
,
cause
her
head
to
droop
,
while
a
rosy
tint
spring
brightly
o'er
<EOS>
her
face
,
—
be
it
anything
that
the
reader
should
stop
to
wonder
at
?
<EOS>
We
think
not

<EOS>
very
few
but
would
have
do
the

<EOS>
a
stranger
,
after
travel
through
much
of
the
surround
country
,
would
have
be
strike
with
the
air
of
taste
and
elegant
neatness
belong
to
it

compare
with
the
more
slovenly
appearance
of
many
of
its
neighbor

<EOS>
the
ground

be
generally
level
,
of
a
fertile
order

and
exhibit
mark
of
fruitful
tillage

<EOS>
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
cottage
,
grass

spring
up
,

a
thick
green
sward
,
a
sure
indicative
of
civilization

<EOS>

be
true
,
but
still
answer
the
purpose
for
which
they
be
design
,
mark
out
the
field
of
tillage
,
and
secure
the
crop
from
the
invasion
of
cattle

out
various

such
as
the
apple

hundred
yard
distant

of
log

where
the
cattle

of

the
road
before

which
wind
over
a
hill
a
short
distance
to

the
whole

the
owner
a
farmer
of
the
first
class
,
breed
in
some
of
the
Eastern
States
,
who
have
come
to
the
"
Far
West
"
with
the
intention
of
here
pass
the
remainder
of
his
day
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
fact
;
and
although
in
speak
of
him
and
his
family
,
we
may
digress
a
little
from
the
main
story
,
we
trust
the
reader
will
deem
such
digression
pardonable
.
<EOS>
William
Webber
be
a
man
in
size
far
above
the
ordinary
—
stand
six
foot
one
inch
,
with
limb
and
body
well
proportion
.
<EOS>
in
year
he
number
some
forty
-
five
,
with
a
robust
,
healthy
look
about
his
face
that
would
have
set
him
five
year
young
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
remarkable
in
his
countenance
,
which
be
open
and
frank
in
expression
,
wherein
be
likewise
write
a
look
of
honest
hospitality
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
be
light
,
with
light
-
brown
hair
,
cut
close
and
comb
up
above
a
high
,
intellectual
forehead
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
grey
,
full
,
and
very
expressive
,
as
be
his
feature
generally
.
<EOS>
around
his
mouth
be
a
few
line
that
denote
firmness
,
when
rouse
,
with
courage
to
act
;
while
his
feature
exhibit
a
calm
self
-
possession
that
would
be
of
very
material
service
to
one
in
the
hour
of
peril
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
bear
and
breed
in
the
good
old
State
of
Massachusetts
,
where
he
live
in
comfortable
circumstance
,
until
about
five
year
previous
to
the
opening
of
our
story
;
when
follow
up
a
desire
he
have
for
sometime
entertain
,
he
come
to
the
West
,
purchase
the
land
where
he
now
reside
,
build
the
cottage
,
return
,
and
soon
remove
his
family
hither
;
which
consist
of
a
wife
and
two
son
—
one
now
age
twenty
,
the
other
some
three
year
his
elder
.
<EOS>
His
wife
be
a
robust
,
healthy
looking
woman
,
some
five
year
his
junior
,
of
the
medium
height
,
very
fleshy
,
with
a
full
,
round
,
good
-
natured
-
look
countenance
,
such
as
we
behold
almost
daily
,
and
one
to
whom
the
adage
,
"
fat
,
fair
and
forty
,
"
would
be
truly
applicable
.
<EOS>
the
eld
son
,
John
,
in
some
respect
resemble
his
father
—
tall
,
well
-
build
,
with
feature
of
a
similar
shape
,
though
in
expression
far
different
.
<EOS>
in
say
there
be
a
resemblance
between
him
and
his
father
,
we
wish
the
reader
to
distinctly
understand
it
be
only
in
the
formation
of
the
feature
—
all
else
be
totally
different
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
be
dark
,
with
jet
black
hair
,
and
eye
somewhat
shade
by
dark
,
heavy
,
overhanging
brow
.
<EOS>
around
his
mouth
be
line
similar
to
those
of
his
father
,
yet
take
more
of
a
sinister
turn
.
<EOS>
His
look
generally
,
be
that
of
a
man
dark
,
deep
,
and
treacherous
,
and
one
little
likely
to
inspire
confidence
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
when
he
smile
,
which
he
do
but
seldom
,
that
you
would
have
be
the
most
strike
by
an
expression
from
which
you
would
involuntarily
recoil
,
as
from
the
gaze
of
a
deadly
serpent
.
<EOS>
from
youth
up
,
John
have
be
a
being
isolate
as
it
be
from
the
world
,
wrap
up
in
his
own
dark
thought
,
communing
but
seldom
with
any
,
and
then
with
those
of
a
disposition
like
to
his
own
.
<EOS>
already
have
he
cause
his
father
much
anxiety
and
trouble
;
and
be
,
in
fact
,
one
cause
of
his
remove
to
the
West
,
where
he
think
he
would
be
free
from
the
snare
and
temptation
likely
to
be
throw
around
him
in
the
East
,
and
where
as
he
suppose
he
would
be
free
at
least
from
companion
in
vice
,
and
where
,
to
sum
up
,
he
would
in
all
probability
spend
his
day
in
honest
pursuit
.
<EOS>
Could
the
first
design
of
his
father
have
be
strictly
carry
out
,
viz
:
that
of
remove
him
from
temptation
,
bad
company
,
and
so
forth
,
the
latter
may
perchance
have
follow
.
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
in
select
the
West
,
and
more
especially
this
part
of
it
,
he
undesignedly
open
a
field
for
the
cultivation
of
his
son
's
natural
disposition
,
by
throw
him
among
the
most
depraved
villain
of
which
society
could
boast
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
an
apt
scholar
,
the
sequel
of
our
story
will
probably
show
.
<EOS>
His
brother
Rufus
,
young
by
three
year
,
be
of
a
make
and
disposition
in
every
respect
totally
different
.
<EOS>
in
stature
he
be
of
the
medium
size
,
straight
and
slim
,
with
light
hair
,
and
a
fair
,
sunny
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
regular
,
approach
perhaps
a
little
too
much
<EOS>
the
feminine
,
with
such
an
open
,
expressive
frankness
of
look
,
that
your
confidence
be
immediately
win
.
<EOS>
His
disposition
be
mild
and
affable
,
his
voice
rich
and
musical
in
tone
,
while
his
full
blue
eye
not
unfrequently
flash
forth
gleam
of
a
lofty
intellect
.
<EOS>
around
his
mouth
also
,
be
line
similar
to
those
of
his
father
,
expressive
of
firmness
and
a
determination
of
character
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
other
of
whom
we
must
speak
to
complete
the
family
,
in
order
to
do
which
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
go
back
somewhat
in
our
narrative
.
<EOS>
about
fifteen
year

<EOS>
He

stern
looking
man

some
thirty

five

and
of

taciturn
disposition

from
his

as
to

his
leave
,
since
when
he
have
never

<EOS>
enquiry
be

by

nothing
authentic
have
ever

him

<EOS>
a
man
answer
his
description
be
see
a
short
time
after
in
the
western
part
of
New
York
,
apparently
bind
for
the
West
;
and
Webber
come
to
the
conclusion
the
child
have
be
voluntarily
desert
;
the
more
so
,
as
on
question
her
,
the
account
she
give
be
of
harsh
treatment
,
and
sometimes
severe
chastisement
,
for
ask
of
home
.
<EOS>
the
child
be
too
young
to
give
even
a
succinct
detail
of
her
adventure
,
remember
only
some
of
the
more
glaring
,
such
as
the
dark
man
carry
her
away
from
home
,
put
her
in
a
house
that
float
on
the
water
,
and
the
like
—
from
all
of
which
Webber
draw
his
conclusion
that
she
have
be
bring
from
another
country
,
perhaps
across
the
Atlantic
,
by
an
intrigueing
design
he
be
unable
to
fathom
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
riddle
too
deep
for
the
gossip
infest
the
neighborhood
of
Webber
(
as
what
place
do
they
not
)
to
solve
,
concern
who
be
the
child
,
who
be
her
parent
,
where
she
come
from
,
and
so
forth
;
and
after
various
conjecture
,
probable
and
improbable
,
they
finally
agree
that
her
parent
be
no
well
than
they
should
be
,
and
that
be
of
that
doubtful
cast
,
it
be
well
to
shun
the
company
of
the
child
,
lest
by
intercourse
their
prudish
decorum
should
be
vielate
,
and
their
over
-
wise
virtuous
principle
become
contaminate
.

and
the

six

be
employ

the
unmarriageable
spinster
and
old
lady
with
spectacle
,
in
conjecture

discussion
as
to
the
strange
singularity
of
such
an
event

and
she
who
have
in
her
early
year
be
consider
in
birth
far
beneath
them
,
be
now
,
by
this
incident
,
place
far

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
the
inconsistency
of
human
beings!A
new
epoch
be
now
open
to
Emily
;
for
Webber
,
punctual
to
what
he
consider
a
duty
,
take
immediate
step
to
place
her
in
one
of
the
good
institution
in
the
city
of
New

,
in
charge
of
a
distant
relative
,
who
,
move
in
the
good
circle
of

give
her
not

the
advantage
of
intellectual
education

but
also
that
of
acquire
the
ease
,
grace
and
dignity
belong
to
the
true
etiquette
of
fashion

<EOS>
soon
after
this
disposition
of
Emily
,
Webber
make
a
tour
to
the
West
,
purchase
a
farm
as
already
show
,
and
remove
thither
with
his
family
.
<EOS>
four
year
pass
,
and
Emily
see
nothing
of
the
Webbers
.
<EOS>
during
this
period
she
have
grow
to
womanhood
,
and
what
have
promise
so
well
when
young
,
be
amply
fulfil
in
maturer
year
.
<EOS>
She
become
attractive
in
person
,
graceful
in
accomplishment
,
while
her
intellectual
faculty
far
exceed
ordinary
mind
.
<EOS>
Her
temperament
be
truly
poetic
,
with
nothing
of
affectation
or
coquetry
(
which
spoil
so
many
)
in
her
manner
.
<EOS>
—
She
be
a
warm
patriot
and
enthusiast
;
and
when
converse
on
some
noble
theme
,
dull
must
be
the
eye
that
would
not
flash
,
or
the
mind
that
would
not
fire
,
with
the
inspiration
throw
from
her
speak
eye
and
glow
flowery
language
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
New
York
that
Edward
Merton
,
then
a
student
in
the
University
,
first
become
acquaint
with
Emily
;
and
strike
,
we
may
add
fascinate
,
with
manner
and
appearance
so
far
above
the
gay
flirt
thing
with
which
she
be
surround
<EOS>
,
he
seek
,
gain
an
introduction
,
and
almost
immediately
commence
pay
her
his
address
.
<EOS>
the
result
of
those
address
,
thus
far
,
the
reader
have
already
see
.
<EOS>
although
it
be
generally
believe
that
Emily
be
rich
,
yet
she
know
to
the
contrary
;
and
possess
of
a
pride
too
noble
to
take
advantage
of
such
a
reputation
,
she
,
through
a
sensitive
delicacy
,
repulse
the
advancement
often
make
by
those
whom
she
consider
her
superior
in
point
of
wealth
.
<EOS>
wealth
be
certainly
a
great
bar
to
the
progress
of
Merton
;
a
bar
<EOS>
,
in
fact
,
which
he
find
far
more
difficult
to
pass
than
he
at
first
suppose
;
and
although
his
nobleness
of
heart
,
his
sincere
,
ardent
passion
,
inspire
within
her
own
breast
feeling
of
affection
—
of
love
—
yet
pride
prevail
;
and
Merton
,
to
whom
she
reveal
her
scruple
,
see
with
painful
regret
that
unless
there
be
some
counteracting
power
,
Emily
may
love
,
but
would
never
consent
to
be
his
.
<EOS>
tired
of
city
life
,
and
the
gay
frivoltie
of
the

Emily
long
for

make

about
six
month
prior

most
happy

be
the
meeting
between
Emily
and
her
friend
,
who
have
be
to
her
as

<EOS>
Webber
,
when
he
come
fairly
to
recognise
the
"
long
lose
one
,
"
as
he
term
her
,
could
scarcely
restrain
himself
for
joy
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
even
John
,
as
he
extend
the
hand
of
welcome
,
seem
to
smile
with
less
of
deceit
and
more
of
earnestness
than
be
his
will
not
;
while
Rufus
approach
her
with
that
bashful
timidity
,
almost
amount
to
awe
,
which
person
of
sensitive
mind
often
exhibit
when
they
fancy
themselves
in
the
presence
of
their
superior
.
<EOS>
a
great
change
have
be
work
in
the
personal
appearance
of
Emily
.
<EOS>
She
have
leave
them
as
it
be
a
child
,
and
as
such
they
remember
her
;
consequently
there
be

their
joy

such
a
fine

as

that
up

more
pleasing

not
unfrequently

off
in

,
and
pace
with
anxious
stride
the
floor
of
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
"I
wonder
they
do
not
arrive
!
"
<EOS>
at
length
he
exclaim
;
"
they
surely
have
have
time
enough
since
the
shower
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
speak
he
stride
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
moon
have
sufficiently
rise
to
throw
light
upon
a
scene
,
where
the
work
of
devastation
have
be
carry
on
to
a
remarkable
degree
.
<EOS>
as
Webber
gaze
around
him
,
he
behold
in
every
direction
tall
,
lofty
tree
tear
from
their
foundation
—
<EOS>
limb
tear
from
the
trunk
of
other
—
fence
level
to
the
ground
,
and
the
crop
,
the
toil
of
a
season
,
beat
to
the
earth
as
though
trample
by
a
caravan
.
<EOS>
but
with
this
it
be
evident
<EOS>
his
mind
be
but
little
occupied
;
for
after
cast
a
hasty
glance
over
the
scene
,
he
turn
in
another
direction
,
and
his
eye
follow
the
road
,
<EOS>
which
at
some
little
distance
to
the
east
wound
over
the
brow
of
a
hill
.
<EOS>
here
he
gaze
intently
for
a
few
moment
,
while
the
gloom
which
have
be
settle
over
his
feature
,
gradually
deepen
.
<EOS>
as
he
stand
gaze
thus
,
a
sigh
,
which
seem
to
come
from
the
heart
,
cause
him
to
turn
his
head
,
when
he
behold
Rufus
—
who
have
noiselessly
follow
him
to
the
door
—
with
his
eye
fix
in
the
same
direction
,
his
feature
pale
,
almost
ghastly
—
while
the
working
of
his
countenance
,
and
the
quivering
of
his
lip
,
denote
a
strange
nervous
excitability
.
<EOS>
"rufus
!
<EOS>
Rufus
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Webber
,
take
hold
of
his
arm
;
"
what
mean
this
,
my
son?—why
be
you
so
agitated?"the
young
man
start
,
pass
his
hand
across
his
eye
,
look
hurriedly
around
,
as
one
suddenly
awaken
from
a
dream
;
and
then
,
while
a
slight
flush
tinge
his
handsome
feature
,
quietly
withdraw
without
deign
a
reply
.
<EOS>
at
another
time
such
singularity
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
his
son
,
would
have
attract
the
attention
of
Webber
to
know
the
cause
;
but
under
the
present
circumstance
,
his
own
mind
be
too
much
occupy
to
give
it
heed
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
longer
,
he
stand
,
his
eye
fix
in
the
direction
mention
,
and
then
,
as
if
sadly
disappointed
,
with
slow
and
musing
pace
return
to
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
"strange
!
"
say
he
,
"
that
they
do
not
return
.
<EOS>
I
fear
they
have
meet
with
some
serious
accident
;
for
this
storm
have
be
most
alarming
in
its
consequence
.
<EOS>
""Had
we
not
better
go
in
search
?
"
<EOS>
enquire
Rufus
,
his
voice
tremble
with
emotion
.
<EOS>
"true
,
my
son
,
we
must

"
<EOS>
reply
Webber
,
with
decision
.
<EOS>
"
Can
the
horse
be
find
conveniently?""I
observe
two
,
but
a
few
pace
distant

rejoin
Rufus
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
you
will
not
both
leave
?
"
say
Mrs.
Webber
,
enquiringly
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
no
,
"
answer
Webber
,
thoughtfully
;
"
one
I
think
will
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
""then
<EOS>
I
will
go

"
say
Rufus
,
with
energy
.
"Why
<EOS>
so
,
my
son?""Ask
me
not

;
I
have
reason

reply
he
,
confusedly
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
be
it
so
;
but
be
speedy
.
"
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
start
,
for
he
fancy
he
hear
voice
in
conversation
;
and
move
quickly
to
the
door
,
both
father
and
son
listen
attentively
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
they
come
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Webber
,
as
some
figure
be
descry
descend
the
hill
.
<EOS>
"She
be
not
there
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Rufus
,
quickly
.
"How
<EOS>
know
you
that
?
<EOS>
"
enquire
Webber
!
"
<EOS>
with
my
eye
I
can
not
distinguish
individual
at
that
distance
.
<EOS>
how
know
you
Emily
be
not
there
,
Rufus?"But
Rufus
be
go
;
and
his
father
discern
his
figure
,
at
some
little
distance
,
glide
swiftly
on
in
the
direction
of
the
horse
.
<EOS>
a
moment
or
two
later
,
he
hear
the
clattering
of
hoofs
,
and
his
son
ride
quickly
past
.
<EOS>
He
call
to
him
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
hear
not
,
heed
not
,
but
urge
his
horse
to
his
utmost
speed
.
"Why
<EOS>
the
youth
be
insane
!
"
<EOS>
remark
Webber
,
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>

—
now

and
with
an
agitated
step
,
he
move
on
in
the

direction
.
<EOS>
the
voice
of
the
approach
party
be
,
in
the
meanwhile

grow
louder
as
they
near
him

and
Webber
be
soon

to

<EOS>
He
pause
to
listen
,
for
he

a

well
to

out

<EOS>
His
mother
,
whose
whole
soul
seem
bind
up
in
him
,
pace
the
room
,
wring
her
hand
in
an
agony
of
grief
,
and
cry
:
"
<EOS>
oh
,
my
God
!
<EOS>
my
God
!
<EOS>
spare
me
<EOS>
this!"there
be
some
people
so
constitute
by
nature
,
that
they
possess
no
feeling
in
common
with
the
rest
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
with
those
around
them
they
have
no
kindre
tie
,
no
sympathetic
chord
that
vibrate
at
the
slight
touch
,
link
soul
with
soul
in
the
holy
bond
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
They
live
in
,
yet
separate
as
it
be
,
from
the
world
;
and
be
think
by
the
rest
of
mankind
to
be
cold
,
unsocial
,
unfeele
.
<EOS>
perhaps
in
a
great
measure
they
be
so
;
yet
notwithstanding
,
they
have
their
object
of
affection
,
for
the
heart
must
cling
to
something
,
and
in
proportion
as
they
isolate
themselves
from
the
many
,
<EOS>
so
do
their
soul
embrace
the
few
,
or
the
one
,
with
a
violence
of
passion
other
<EOS>
deem
not
they
possess

<EOS>
such
be
,
in
part
,
the
case
with
Mrs.
Webber
.
'
<EOS>
tis
true
she
like
her
husband
,
she
like
her
family
,
her
friend
,
but
Rufus
be
the
idol
,
the
only
idol
of
her
soul
.
<EOS>
in
him
be
her
hope
,
fear
and
joy
center
.
<EOS>
a
woman
that
say
very
little
,
she
be
not
one
to
make
an
outward
show
of
affection
,
by
a
thousand
little
demonstration
that
count
so
much
in
the
eye
of
the
world
,
and
a
stranger
may
have
think
she
feel
alike
toward
all
.
<EOS>
She
would
steal
away
unseen
,
and
hour
by
hour
watch
,
concentrate
her
very
soul
on
him
,
with
all
the
deep
,
holy
devotion
of
a
mother
's
love
.
<EOS>
and
well
be
he
worthy
—
for
within
his
breast
beat
a
pure
,
a
high
-
minded
,
noble
heart
.
<EOS>
what
then
be
her
feeling
when
she
see
him
stretch
on
a
bed
of
sickness
—
pain
—
with
reason
,
the
immortal
endowment
of
God
,
totter
upon
its
throne
?
<EOS>
who
shall
tell
—
who
describe
a
mother
's
anguish
in
a
scene
like
this
?
<EOS>
when
she
behold
the
beloved
of
her
soul
in
the
jaw
of
earth
's
mighty
foe

death

<EOS>
word
fail
,
the
pen
droop
,
and
we
veil
the
feeling
from
the
eye
of
all
but
imagination
.
<EOS>
an
hour
or
two
later
Merton
and
Emily
arrive
.
<EOS>
They
be
warmly
greet
,
but
there
be
no
rejoicing
.
<EOS>
over
all
hang
the
cold
icy
gloom
which
pervade
the
house
of
mourn

<EOS>
—
word
be

in
whisper
,
and
each
glide
stealthily
about
,
with
that
mysterious
air
which
remind
one
of
the
fabled
spectre
of
tradition

<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Emily
,
like
a
minister
spirit
,
immediately
take
her
place
at
the
bedside
of
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
She
feel
grieve
to
the
heart
,
for
she
love
him
with
a
sister
's
love
.
<EOS>
both
herself
and
Merton
be
surprised
to
learn
he
have
be
in
pursuit
of
them
.
<EOS>
—
They
have
never
see
him
.
<EOS>
once
they
have
fancy
they
hear
the
sound
of
a
horse
somewhat
distant
,
but
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
this
annunciation
surprise
all
,
for
it
be
evident
that
he
have
see
them
,
as
he
have
tell
of
their
come
.
<EOS>
Webber
muse
on
the
singular
conduct
of
Rufus
,
prior
to
his
departure
,
which
now
strike
him
with
force
,
shake
his
head
gravely
,
but
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Merton
have
partake
of
some
refreshment
,
he
mount
another
horse
and
ride
swiftly
to
St.
Louis
for
a
physician
,
who
arrive
toward
night
of
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
He
feel
of
the
sufferer
's
pulse
—
look
grave
—
feel
of
his
pulse
again
—
shake
his
head
,
and
pronounce
it
a
severe
case
of
intermittent
fever
.
<EOS>
on
open
the
door
of
the
apartment
where
Curdish
have
be
confine
,
to
the
astonishment
of
all
it
be
find
empty
,
which
be
the
more
unaccountable
,
as
everything
be
fast
just
as
it
have
be
leave
the
evening
before
.
<EOS>
Webber
be
both
vexed
and
perplex
that
the
villain
have
thus
escape
;
but
after
reason
awhile
with
himself
,
he
come
to
the
conclusion
that
under
the
present
circumstance
it
be
all
for
the
good
;
and
his
thought
of
vengeance
gradually
emerge
into
fear
for
the
life
of
his
young
bear
.
<EOS>
We
must
now
leave
all
for
the
present
,
and
turn
to
another

<EOS>
THE
tale.on
<EOS>
the
bank
of
the
Osage
,
some
several
mile
from
where
it
empty
into
the
dark
and
muddy
Missouri
,
be
a
wild
,
gloomy
and
romantic
spot
.
<EOS>
—
even
at
the
present
day
it
have
not
be
reach
by
civilization
,
and
still
stand
alone
in
the
solemn
grandeur
of
nature
.
<EOS>
here
mountain
rear
their
rugged
head
steep
and
stupendous
;
there
fearful
chasm
yawn
as
if
await
some
prey
for
their
mighty
jaw
;
while
anon
dash
along
some
sparkling
rivulet
,
leap
from
rock
to
rock
,
make
music
in
its
devious
course
,
until
finally
plunge
into
some
large
stream
,
its
tiny
youthful
song
be
forever
bury
in
oblivion
.
<EOS>
from
the
Osage
,
back
for
some
little
distance
,
flow
a
creek
—
reflect
its
rugge
bank
in
its
silvery
bosom
as
in
a
mirror
—
and
terminate
in
a
semi
,
or
three
-
quarter
circle
cove
,
surround
by
tall
,
majestic
,
overhanging
cliff
.
<EOS>
this
water
be
supply
from
the
Osage
,
and
pass
as
it
do
between
such
craggy
steep
,
form
a
dark
,
lonely
,
silent
retreat
.
<EOS>
the
rock
surround
its
termination
be
high
and
arching
,
so
that
their
base
can
only
be
approach
by
water
.
<EOS>
within
this
cove
,
beneath
these
rock
,
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
be
an
extensive
cavern
—
know
at
the
present
day
by
the
name
of
"
the
Robber
's
Cave
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
calculate
as
a
fugitive
retreat
;
for
defend
by
a
few
,
it
would
be
a
risky
attack
for
a
combine
force
,
even
though
possess
of
overwhelming
number
.
<EOS>
It
could
be
approach
only
by
boat
come
from
the
Osage
,
as
the
side
of
the
creek
be
line
with
precipitous
rock
,
where
descent
would
be
at
the
imminent
peril
of
the
hardy
adventurer
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
in
fact
,
a
spot
which
seem
as
it
be
plan
and
fortify
by
Nature
,
in
one
of
her
wildest
mood
,
for
some
great
and
daring
enterprise
.
<EOS>
stand
on
the
summit
of
one
of
the
surround
cliff
,
the
eye
embrace
an
extensive
scope
of
country
,
whose
ragged
,
picturesque
surface
present
scene
sublimely
beautiful
,
and
as
variegate
as
the
wildest
conception
of
the
most
vivid
imagination
.
<EOS>
here
you
beheld
a
stunted
growth
of
tree
overhang
some
frightful
precipice
;
there
rock
pile
tople
up
,
until
they
seem
ready
to
fall
with
a
crash
vengeance
upon
minor
object
below
;
while
wind
like
a
silvery
belt
between
,
at
some
little
distance
,
be
the
dark
and
silent
osage
,
glide
on
to
be
unite
with
one
of
earth
's
mighty
river
,
and
then
forever
lose
in
its
last
long
home
of
the
boundless
deep
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
in
contemplate
the
beauty
and
grandeur
of
Nature
,
something
so
fascinating
,
so
holy
,
so
inspiring
—
we
feel
so
draw
away
from
the
many
petty
trifle
of
common
life
,
that
to
die
amid
such
scene
appear
to
us
as
it
be
rob
death
of
half
his
terror
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
then
we
feel
purify
—
elevate
;
we
feel
that
we
be
alone
in
the
presence
of
God
—
Almighty
God
!
<EOS>
and
when
it
shall
be
our
fate
,
as
sooner
or
later
it
must
be
,
(
and
with
all
)
to
pass
the
bourne
whence
none
return
,
o
!
<EOS>
let
our
body
be
consign
to
dust
beside
the
dashing
of
some
stream
,
away
from
the
haunt
of
man
,
where
the
soul
,
the
sublime
soul
of
Nature
herself
pervades!The
cavern
of
which
we
have
make
mention
,
and
to
which
we
must
now
turn
our
attention
,
be
enter
from
the
creek
,
through
a
small
aperture
some
two
foot
above
the
water
.
<EOS>
from
this
you
descend
rather
abruptly
some
ten
or
fifteen
foot
,
when
you
find
yourself
in
a
large
,
arch
cave
of
stone
,
sufficient
in
size
to
contain
an
hundred
and
fifty
person
.
<EOS>
from
this
be
a
low
arched
passage
through
the
rock
,
lead
into
another
apartment
,
some
twenty
by
thirty
foot
.
<EOS>
this
secret
retreat
,
at
the
date
of
our
story
,
be
the
grand
rendezvous
of
a
numerous
bandit
,
of
whom
mention
have
be
make
in
the
opening
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
along
the
side
of
the
cave
be
range
pistol
,
knife
,
rifle
,
carbine
,
powder
-
flask
,
and
all
the
various
insignia
of
warfare
.
<EOS>
at
one
end
be
erect
a
platform
,
whereon
the
chief
of
the
bandit
sit
or
stand
,
when
hold
public
council
.
<EOS>
along
the
side
be
range
oaken
bench
,
where
the
member
could
be
seat
,
and
the
whole
together
wear
an
air
of
comfort
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
but
of
the
Inner
Cave
,
or
Chieftain
's
Chamber
,
as
it
be
generally
call
,
we
wish
for
the
present
to
speak
more
particularly
.
<EOS>
Could
one
have
be
introduce
into
it
privately
,
or
without
know
where
he
be
,
and
see
it
light
in
all
its
brilliancy
,
he
would
have
fancy
himself
in
the
gorgeous
apartment
of
some
palace
,
rather
than
in
a
robber
's
cave
.
<EOS>
everything
in
the
shape
of
splendor
and
luxury
be
there
.
<EOS>
a
rich
damask
silk
curtain
,
arrange
in
graceful
fold
,
extend
round
and
completely
screen
the
wall
;
against
which
,
from
floor
to
ceiling
,
extend
four
splendid
mirror
,
in
gilt
frame
,
each
place
opposite
the
other
,
occupy
the
four
side
of
the
apartment
and
reflect
every
object
in
it
.
<EOS>
much
of
the
intervene
space
on
the
wall
be
fill
with
painting
of
various
and
fanciful
design
,
but
all
evidently
execute
by
artist
of
no
ordinary
talent:—in
fact
,
some
of
them
be
from
the
great
master
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
on
the
floor
,
which
be
dark
,
of
marble
polish
,
stand
several
sofa
,
of
elegant
workmanship
,
together
with
a
table
of
solid
stone
,
most
beautifully
carve
,
on
which
,
strange
as
it
may
seem
,
be
pile
book
and
music
.
<EOS>
a
guitar
and
violin
,
evidently
in
much
requisition
,
be
lie
carelessly
on
one
of
the
sofa
,
beside
which
,
in
seem
contrast
,
lie
a
brace
of
pistol
,
a
gold
mount
short
sword
and
a
silver
handle
dirk
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
in
fact
,
several
of
the
last
mention
article
be
occupy
position
in
different
part
of
the
Chamber
,
strangely
at
variance
with
its
otherwise
poetical
aspect
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
outlet
to
this
apartment
,
save
the
aperture
already
mention
as
connect
it
with
the
large
cave
,
and
consequently
the
light
,
which
must
of
necessity
be
artificial
,
proceed
from
a
gold
mount
chandelier
,
suspend
midway
of
the
ceiling
,
and
give
to
each
thing
a
soft
,
dreamy
,
voluptuous
appearance
.
<EOS>
We
have
say
there
be
no
outlet
,
save
one
;
but
in
addition
to
what
the
reader
have
already
see
,
be
a
recess
,
enter
by
draw
aside
the
fold
of
the
curtain
,
sufficiently
large
for
a
sleep
apartment
,
and
be
doubtless
use
for
this
purpose
,
as
it
contain
the
requisite
.
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
appear
strange
to
the
reader
,
that
so
much
of
luxury
,
civilization
,
and
even
refinement
,
should
be
find
at
this
period
,
so
far
back
in
the
wild
of
Missouri
,
and
what
be
more
,
in
a
robber
's
cave
.
<EOS>
but
to
the
very
circumstance
of
its
be
a
robber
's
cave
,
let
it
be
attribute
;
for
the
access
that
an
organize
bandit
would
have
to
various
kind
of
plunder
,
may
be
say
to
be
almost
limitless
.
<EOS>
that
such
thing
as
we
have
mention
could
have
be
procure
and
bring
hither
,
no
one
will
question
—
that
they
be
,
we
assert
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
another
thing
to
be
take
into
consideration
.
<EOS>
that
the
chief
of
these
outlaw
be
no
ordinary
individual
,
that
he
be
a
man
of
some
learning
,
taste
and
refinement
—
of
a
fanciful
,
poetical
temperament
—
<EOS>
the
selection
and
arrangement
of
the
article
in
his
private
apartment
go
to
prove
.
<EOS>
but
this
will
doubtless
be
develop
in
the
progress
of
our
story
,
therefore
we
will
not
anticipate
,
but
turn
our
attention
to
the
present
occupant
of
the
Chieftain
's
Chamber
.
<EOS>
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
with
which
we
close
the
precede
chapter
,
recline
in
an
easy
,
graceful
attitude
on
one
of
the
sofa
of
this
elegant
apartment
,
be
a
beautiful
female
of
some
twenty
summer
.
<EOS>
to
give
anything
like
a
perfect
description
of
her
dress
and
appearance
,
will
,
we
fear
,
be
an
impossibility
;
yet
we
may
be
able
to
draw
a
sketch
,
from
which
the
imagination
of
the
reader
may
fill
the
picture
.
<EOS>
Her
feature
be
cast
in
nature
's
fine
mould
,
and
though
not
strictly
classic
,
yet
possess
an
appearance
of
delicate
chiseling
,
if
we
may
so
express
it
,
which
be
never
see
save
in
those
whose
mental
power
predominate
over
their
physical
—
or
,
in
other
word
,
whose
intellectual
command
our
respect
,
where
otherwise
the
animal
would
excite
our
passion
.
<EOS>
Her
skin
be
dark
and
speak
her
spanish
origin
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
be
black
,
and
fall
in
a
sort
of
graceful
negligence
around
a
beautiful
rounded
neck
,
which
be
bare
low
,
and
give
her
a
somewhat
voluptuous
appearance
;
nor
be
this
lessen
by
her
round
,
plump
,
soft
arm
—
bare
nearly
to
her
shoulder
—
one
of
which
be
throw
gracefully
under
her
head
,
and
end
in
a
small
pretty
hand
,
with
gently
taper
fingers,—the
latter
,
by
the
way
,
glitter
with
ring
of
great
value
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
black
—
sparkle
black
—
in
whose
liquid
depth
you
could
see
the
fire
of
passion
,
the
jealousy
of
love
and
the
revenge
of
hate
.
<EOS>
love
be
there
—
wild
passionate
love
—

<EOS>
there
be
about
her
mouth
a
peculiar
expression

which
we
can
not
forbear
to
notice

a

defiance

occasionally
find

I

<EOS>

My
very
existence
seem
center
in
hers

and
the
very
idea
of
a
separation
by
death
would
often
fill
my
young
eye
with
tear

<EOS>
I
remember
we
live
in
comfortable
circumstance
.
<EOS>
We
occupy
a
beautiful
little
cottage
,
surround
by
a
landscape
variegate
and
pleasing
,
stretch
far
away
in
gentle
undulation
,
like
the
swell
of
the
ocean
in
a
calm
,
and
end
in
hill
,
which
to
my
young
fancy
seem
rise
as
guardian
to
overlook
and
watch
the
valley
below
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
delightful
quiet
about
the
spot
,
which
even
as
I
recall
it
lend
a
soothing
influence
to
my
restless
,
turbulent
spirit
.
<EOS>
near
to
our
cottage
be
a
shady
grove
,
through
which
slowly
meander
a
lovely
stream
,
on
whose
velvet
-
like
bank
I
have
linger
many
an
hour
,
angle
for
the
finy
tribe
in
its
placid
bosom
.
<EOS>
in
the
more
immediate
vicinity
of
the
cottage
be
a
garden
of
flower
,
of
all
kind
and
hue
,
and
the
wall
themselves
be
shade
by
the
creeping
,
cling
ivy
.
<EOS>
the
whole
scene
may
be
describe
as
a
perfect
picture
of
domestic
happiness
;
and
to
this
and
my
mother
's
gentle
disposition
,
I
have
ever
feel
myself
indebted
for
those
fine
feeling
which
be
so
foreign
to
my
present
occupation
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
seem
happiness

(
<EOS>
and
,
alas

<EOS>
reality
have
teach
me

if
we
fathom

we
shall
find
in
most
case
that
what
we
take
for
happiness
be
but
the
seeming
)
<EOS>
there
be
sorrow
even
in
that
cottage
—
in
the
heart
of
my
own
beloved
mother
.
<EOS>
It
often
appear
strange
to
me
,
even
in
my
early
day
,
that
I
never
see
my
father
,
that
I
never
hear
my
mother
speak
of
him
;
and
when
curiosity
excite
me
to
enquire
of
her
—
as
it
sometimes
would
—
the
reason
,
she
ever
grow
sad
,
melancholy
,
and
put
me
off
with
the
answer
that
she
would
inform
me
at
some
future
time
—
that
I
be
not
yet
enough
advance
in
year
to
understand
.
<EOS>
this
of
course
but
add
fuel
to
the
flame
;
<EOS>
but
as
I
see
the
question
ever
pain
her
,
I
finally
drop
it
altogether
,
trust
that
she
would
inform
me
in
her
own
good
time
.
<EOS>
"She
be
a
woman
of
fine
taste
and
education
,
and
under
her
own
instruction
I
be
early

to
read
and
write
;
and
possess
a
choice
library
of
poetry
and
romance
,
and
my
mind
be
naturally
bent
in
that
channel
<EOS>
,
I
take
to
book
with
great
avidity
,
and
while
away
many
a
long
evening
,
or
what
would
otherwise
have
be
so
,
in
read
to
her
such
passage
as
I
fancy
most
in
accordance
with
her
gentle
spirit
.
<EOS>
thus
pass
the
first
twelve
and
happy
year
of
my
existence
.
<EOS>
"feele
<EOS>
that
I
have
now

at
the
proper
age
,
and
that
it
be
a
duty
she
owe
me

,
she
determine
on
send
me
to
school
;
and
though
the
idea
of
part
with
me
be
painful
,
yet
as
she
feel
it
be
for
my
own
benefit
<EOS>
she
do
so
,
the
pleading
of
duty
become
paramount
to
feeling
,
and
unknown
to
myself
every
thing
be
arrange
for
my
departure

<EOS>
when
she
first
break
the
news
to
me
,
it
come
like
the
shock
of
an
unexpected
thunder
-
bolt
;
nor
could
I
believe
her
really
in
earnest
until
she
have
thrice
reiterate
it
.
<EOS>
never
shall
I
forget
the
feeling
which
the
thought
of
separation
occasion
.
<EOS>
separation
have
be
the
one
secret
dread
of
my
life
;
but
it
have
be
the
separation
of
death
only

voluntary
separation
have
never
enter
my
mind

<EOS>
She
at
once
perceive
my
feeling
—
for
they
find
a
sad
echo
in
her
own
heart
,
and
by
gentle
reasoning
seek
to
convince
me
of
the
necessity
and
benefit
of
our
parting
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
She
inform
me
it
be
in
her
power
to
give
me
an
education
;
but
beyond
that
little
or
nothing
;
and
she
feel
anxious
I
should
gain
that
,
which
,
whatever
misfortune
may
befal
me
in
after
year
,
would
ever
be
mine

I
listen
to
<EOS>
her,—I
see
her

bent
upon
it

and
I
acquiesce
,
without
a
word
of
murmur
.
<EOS>
a
few
day
<EOS>
and
we
part
;
but
sad
,
most
sad
,
be
the
parting
.
<EOS>
pardon
me
,
Inez
,
but
the
thought
of
it
make
me
childish
,
"
and
Ronald
pass
his
hand
across
his
eye
,
and
for
a
few
moment
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
"never
<EOS>
,
"
he
resume
at
length
,
"
shall
I
forget
her
sweet
,
mournful
feature
,
as
she
stand
gaze
upon
me
,
on
the
morning
of
my
departure
,
with
a
look
wherein
be
concentrate
all
the
deep
yearning
of
a
mother
's
heart
,
for
a
son
she
may
never
behold
again
;
and
doubtless
there
be
a
presentiment
of
this
kind
at
work
within
her
,
—
for
when
we
come
to
the
final
adieu
,
she
clasp
me
to
her
heart
,
almost
convulsively,—the
tear
roll
down
her
cheeks,—and
<EOS>
it
be
with
difficulty
she
could
utter
,
`
God
bless
you
,
my
son!—farewell
!
<EOS>
if
we
never
meet
again'—she
pause
—
`
forget
not
my
memory
!
'
<EOS>
My
feeling
,
Inez
,
you
may
imagine
;
I
can
not
describe
them
—
word
be
too
weak
.
<EOS>
thus
we
parted"—Ronald
pause
as
if
struggle
with
some
deep
emotion
,
and
them
add
,
faintly—"forever!""forever
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Inez
,
involuntarily
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
forever
!
<EOS>
but
—
the
story:—I
must
be
more
brief
.
<EOS>
the
school
to
which
I
be
send
be
some
hundred
mile
distant
,
and
be
one
,
if
truth
must
be
say
,
better
calculate
to
learn
me
in
the
way
and
vice
of
the
world
,
than
in
knowledge
of
book
.
<EOS>
I
be
there
throw
among
all
class
,
and
leave
without
a
guide
to
choose
my
companion
.
<EOS>
naturally
of
a
bold
,
reckless
disposition
,
I
unfortunately
become
a
favorite
of
the
bad
class
;
and
by
degree
be
lead
into
scene
of
revelry
and
wickedness
,
of
the
existence
of
which
,
ere
<EOS>
I
go
there
,
I
have
never
even
dream
.
<EOS>
It
be
unnecessary
for
me
to
dwell
in
detail
;
suffice
it
,
therefore
,
that
at
the
end
of
three
year
I
leave
the
school
in
disgrace
.
<EOS>
an
hour
after
my
dismissal
,
I
receive
the
news
of
the
death
of
my
mother
,
the
only
friend
I
have
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
be
my
feeling
!
<EOS>
I
have
an
indistinct
recollection
of
a
pressure
—
a
whirl
—
a
fire
in
my
brain
,
and
I
know
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
be
mad
—
rave
mad
!
<EOS>
the
messenger
who
bear
me
the
news
,
bore
me
home
a
maniac
.
<EOS>
home
,
no
!
<EOS>
oh
God
!
<EOS>
it
be
home
no
longer
!
<EOS>
Ere
I
recover
my
reason
,
my
mother
be
moulder
in
the
dust
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
dwell
on
my
feeling
of
grief
and
utter
desolation
,
when
I
again
comprehend
all:—the
subject
be
too
painful
,
and
other
matter
press
me
for
narration
.
<EOS>
the
only
legacy
leave
me
be
a
seal
package
,
which
I
open
with
a
tremble
hand
—
the
content
I
distinctly
remember
,
<EOS>
for
they
be
engrave
upon
the
very
tablet
of
my
heart
.
<EOS>
a
letter
within
,
run
thus:"`my
<EOS>
dear
son
,
God
be
with
you
!
<EOS>
I
be
die
,
and
can
never
see
you
again
on
earth
,
but
will
in
the
land
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
My
strength
be
fail
—
I
have
but
a
few
minute
to
live
,
and
will
devote
them
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
often
question
me
of
your
father
.
<EOS>
I
have
delay
answer
<EOS>
you,—but
<EOS>
the
time
have
now
come
when
it
be
necessary
you
should
know
all
.
<EOS>
God
give
me
strength
to
pen
,
and
you
to
read
the
secret
of
my
life!—and
Ronald
,
dear
Ronald
,
whatever
you
do
,
do
not
reproach
,
do
not
curse
my
memory
!
<EOS>
I
shall
enter
but
little
into
detail
,
for
time
and
strength
will
not
permit
.
<EOS>
at
the
age
of
twelve
I
be
leave
an
orphan
,
and
be
take
in
charge
of
some
distant
relative
of
my
mother
,
with
whom
I
live
in
easy
circumstance
,
until
the
age
of
sixteen
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
wealthy
,
and
yet
have
enough
wherewithal
to
live
independent
.
<EOS>
They
treat
me
with
much
affection
,
and
life
pass
pleasantly
for
four
year
.
<EOS>
at
the
age
of
sixteen
,
I
accidentally
become
acquainted
with
Walter
Langdon
,
only
son
of
Sir
Edgar
Langdon
,
whose
large
estate
and
residence
—
for
he
be
very
wealthy
—
be
but
a
few
mile
distant
.
<EOS>
He
find
opportunity
and
declare
his
attachment
,
but
at
the
same
time
inform
me
that
our
relation
on
either
side
would
be
oppose
to
our
union
,
and
beg
me
to
make
no
mention
of
it
,
but
to
prepare
myself
and
elope
with
him
;
that
when
the
ceremony
be
over
,
and
no
alternative
,
all
party
would
become
reconcile
.
<EOS>
He
be
young
,
handsome
,
and
accomplish
—
his
power
of
conversation
brilliant
.
<EOS>
He
plead
with
a
warmth
of
passion
I
could
not
withstand
—
for
know
,
<EOS>
Ronald
,
I
love
him
,
with
the
ardent
first
love
of
a
girl
of
sixteen
,
and
I
consent
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
Ronald
,
that
I
be
force
to
tell
you
more
:
this
rash
act
be
my
ruin!"`My
strength
be
fail
<EOS>
so
rapidly
I
can
not
enter
into
particular
,
my
son,—and
<EOS>
yet
,
why
should
i?—they
would
only
pain
you
to
read
,
and
me
to
write
.
<EOS>
Suffice
,
Ronald
,
that
he
deceive
me
—
<EOS>
I
become
his
victim
--
and
you
,
<EOS>
oh
God
!
<EOS>
you
be
the
offspring
of
our
guilt
.
<EOS>
"`Shortly
<EOS>
after
this
I
learn
,
to
my
horror
,
that
he
have
unite
himself
with
a
lady
of
wealth
.
<EOS>
He
afterward
see
me
and
offer
me
the
reparation
of
money:—alas
!
<EOS>
what
a
reparation
to
one
whose
hope
be
ruin
!
<EOS>
have
it
not

for
you
,
my
son
,
I
never
would
have
live
to
feel
my
disgrace

<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
accept
his
offer
,
on
condition
that
he
would
never
see
me
more
.
<EOS>
to
this
he
reluctantly
consent
,
and
give
me
a
life
lease
of
the
place
where
you
be
rear
,
and
settle
on
me
a
certain
annuity
,
which
cease
at
my
death

<EOS>
by
economy
I
have
be

to

a
thousand

take
it

may
God
enable
you
to

an
honest

<EOS>
God
support
you
,
dear
Ronald

<EOS>
but
for
the
thought
of
your
grief
and
suffering
,
I
could
die
contented
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
save
you

no

throw

off
and
treat

with
contempt

<EOS>
well

well

it

all
for

may
God
forgive
them

<EOS>
It
be
a
just
punishment
for
my
sin

and
yet
it
be
hard

very

very
hard

'CHAPTER
<EOS>
I."Oh
!
<EOS>
Gods
!
<EOS>
Inez
,
what
think
you
be
my
feeling
,
when
I
read
this
?
<EOS>
It
seem
as
though
all
the
demon
of
hell
itself
be
at
work
within
my
heart
!
<EOS>
be
this
the
world
?
<EOS>
cry
<EOS>
I.
Do
man
live
and
pass
unpunished
—
ay
!
<EOS>
and
more!—are
they
court
by
the
world
,
<EOS>
that
trample
upon
and
break
the
heart
of
God
's
lovely
image
?
<EOS>
do
society
uphold
man
in
deed
of
wickedness
that
would
even
blacken
the
character
of
hell
's
archfiend
?
<EOS>
do
they
drag
man
before
their
mock
tribunal
,
and
sentence
him
to
rot
in
prison
,
because
necessity
force
him
to
take
a
morsel
of
bread
to
save
himself
and
offspre
from
starvation
?
<EOS>
be
this
society?—is
<EOS>
this
the
boasted
land
of
justice
and
religion
?
<EOS>
then
deliver
me
from
it!—then
let
me
war
against
it!—ay
!
<EOS>
let
me
be
an
outlaw
from
that
society
,
which
be
itself
an
outlaw
from
all
that
be
good

such
be
the
thought

Inez

that
rush
forth
from
my
burn
brain

<EOS>
boy
I
be
in
year
,
but
boy
no

<EOS>
I
feel
I
be
alone
in
a
world
black
,
with
sin
,
and
must
choose
and
act
for
myself

<EOS>
nor
be
I
without
experience

<EOS>
the
last
three
year
of
my

if
not
in

have
advance
me
much
in
knowledge

<EOS>
a
change
have
come
over
me

<EOS>
once
I
think
of
nothing

innocent
affection

happy
dream
of
the

now
cloud
dark

rise

what

<EOS>
what

<EOS>
a

he
have
now

decease

who
by
right
should
claim
his
affection

to
be
look
upon
by
him
—
by
my
own
father
—
as
a
be
low
-
bear
,
and
perhaps
spurn
from
his
presence
,
should
I
seek
him
out
?
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
these
thought
crowd
upon
me!"I
go
abroad
,
young
as
I
be
,
and
visit
the
principal
city
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
three
year
I
return
to

exhaust

for

Ronald

or
Ronald

as
circumstance
may
be

<EOS>
He
turn
pale
and
his
eye
sink
before
my
steady
gaze
;
then
recover
his
self

possession
,
he
bid
me
begone
and
never
enter
his
presence
again
—
say
he
know
me
not
—
that

<EOS>
oh

I
fairly
reel

<EOS>
such
word
from
my
father
—
from
the
author
of
my
existence
—
nearly
dethrone
my
reason

<EOS>
by
a
mighty
effort
I
conquer
myself
and
reply
,
my
lip
quiver
with
suppressed
passion
,
that
I
would
leave
on
one
condition
and
never
see
him
more

<EOS>
He
demand
it

<EOS>
money

<EOS>
be
my
only
answer

<EOS>
He
give
me
money
<EOS>
and
I
leave

<EOS>
but
ere
<EOS>
I
do

I
tell
him
the

ay

father
though

I
curse

<EOS>
that
curse

terribly
fulfil

<EOS>
His

then
in
the
bloom

health

shortly
after
die

<EOS>
His
son

near

age

be

<EOS>
His

then
some
three
year
of
age
,
disappear
suddenly
;
and
he
,
to
sum
up
,
survive
but
a
few
month
—
die
a
maniac
—
and
his
estate
pass
into
the
hand
of
another
.
<EOS>
by
what
singular
fatality
<EOS>
I
be
avenge
,
I
know
not
<EOS>
;
but
so
be
the
termination
.
<EOS>
"I
come
to
America
,
and
care
little
what
become
of
me
,
lead
a
dissolute
life
.
<EOS>
for
twelve
year
I
travel
through
the
States
a
professional
gambler
.
<EOS>
this
course
of
life
tend
to
harden
me
to
almost
any
deed
whereby
I
may
be
the
gainer
in
the
shape
of
gold
,
that
glitter
earth
to
which
all
class
bow
in
humble
reverence
.
<EOS>
by
chance
I
fall
in
with
a
lawless
band
of
desperado
,
who
,
through
a
fancy
I
never
could
account
for
,
choose
me
for
their
leader
.
<EOS>
I
accept
the
office
on
condition
that
I
should
have
absolute
sway
so
long
as
remain
their
chief
,
and
that
they
would
allow
me
to
organize
them
as
I
see
proper
.
<EOS>
to
this
,
without
a
dissent
voice
,
they
consent

and
I
be
elect
captain
for
the
term
of
five
year
.
<EOS>
My
first
proceeding
be
to
find
a
safe
rendezvous
and
establish
such
a
code
of
law
as
I
deem
most
beneficial
to
us
as
a
body
.
<EOS>
this
be
do
,
and
it
be
needless
to
tell
you
this
be
the
place
choose
for
our
secret
retreat
.
<EOS>
for
two
year
,
Inez
,
ere
I
see
you

I
lead
a
wild
life

and
though
by
my
deed
I
make
myself
an
outlaw
,
yet
to
this
day
my
hand
be
free
from
the
stain
of
blood
;
still
I
fear
,
if
,
I
remain
much
long
chief
,
I
shall
have
to
put
in
force
a
law
,
which
,
as
executioner
,
will
not

"There

sweetly

<EOS>
"true

I
could
not

deceive
the
only
be

<EOS>
It
be
painful
,
very
painful
,
to
think
that
I
must
tear
myself
from
you

perchance
never

you

I

I
tell
you
all

o

what
be
my
surprise
—
my
joy
—
when
instead
of
spurn
me
from
your

you
tell
me
with
your

sweet
lip
our
fate
be
one

<EOS>
for
a
time

sweet
Inez

I
could
not
believe
it
reality
;
that
there
be
for
the
outcast
so
much
joy
in
store
;
but
the
altar
prove
it
true
.
<EOS>
since
then
,
Inez

I
have
never

<EOS>
then
,
for
the
first

of
crime

do
I
feel
guilt
;
for
the
first
time
sigh
to
be
an
honest
man

<EOS>
but
my
oath
as
bandit
chief
bind
me
for
five
year

<EOS>
I
could
not
break
it

three

<EOS>
Inez

that
be
what
trouble
me

<EOS>
to

a
leader
must
be

<EOS>
by
a
law
which
with
us
be
as
unchangeable
as
those

no

I
would
that
I

leave
to
retire
to
some
secluded
spot
in
quiet
to
enjoy
the
company
of
my
own
dear
Inez

I
be
a
child
of
fate

must
submit
to
the
decree

destiny

<EOS>
if
I
be
again
elect

I

before

I

I
shall

manner
foreign

<EOS>
besides
,
we
have
of
late

very
inactive

there
have
be
dissatisfaction
express
in
regard
to
it
by
some
of
the
member

<EOS>
already
preparation
be
be
make
for
an
attack
on
a
rich
planter

whose
estate
lie
in
Tennessee

border
on
the
Mississippi
in
a
manner
favorable
to
our
design

I

as

must
head
the
expedition

<EOS>
this

some
one
in

Outer
Cave

who
have
give
the
signal
for
the

on

we
have
introduce
the

into
the
grand
rendezvous
of
the
bandit

densely
dark
.
<EOS>
cloud
low
and
heavy
canopy
the
heavens
and
veil
the
light
of
moon
and
star
.
<EOS>
to
add
to
the
gloom
without
,
be
a
thick
fog
and
drizzly
rain
,
which
completely
forbid
all
object
to
the
eye
,
unless
aid
by
artificial
light
.
<EOS>
within
the
large
cave
,
run
through
its
centre
,
be
a
row
of
torch
,
whose
red
,
flicker
glare
give
each
thing
a
somewhat
sombre
and
fantastical
appearance
.
<EOS>
near
the
farther
end
stand
a
group
of
four
figure
,
coarsely
habit
,
whose
large
stature
and
brawny
limb
give
evidence
of
great
animal
power
.
<EOS>
Their
feature
,
by
the
light
of
the
torch
,
be
anything
but
preposesse
,
and
varied
in
expression
only
by
the
inner
working
of
fierce
passion
.
<EOS>
They
be
evidently
on
some
exciting
topic
,
for
their
gesticulation
be
quick
and
fierce
,
their
language
low
and
energetic
,
occasionally
mingle
with
a
guttural
oath
,
which
,
like
the
distant
sound
of
thunder
,
tell
of
the
accumulate
storm
of
passion
ere
long
to
burst
in
fury
on
some
devoted
head
.
<EOS>
neither
of
them
wear
coat
or
vest
;
but
a
coarse
shirt
cover
their
shoulder
,
and
be
entirely
open
in
front
,
leave
their
broad
,
bronze
bosom
free
.
<EOS>
with
the
exception
of
one
,
their
muscular
arm
be
bare
;
this
exception
be
doubtless
cause
by
an
accident
,
as
the
owner
carry
his
arm
in
a
sling
.
<EOS>
around
each
waist
pass
a
belt
,
in
which
,
convenient
to
the
hand
,
be
place
pistol
,
knife
and
dagger
,
ready
for
use
at
any
moment
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
the
conversation
,
as
we
have
say
,
be
low
and
hurried
;
but
at
length
a
voice
,
as
though
passion
have
get
the
well
of
prudence
,
exclaim
somewhat
loudly:"Hang
me
,
but
they
shall
both
die
!
<EOS>
I—""Hush
,
fool
!
"
<EOS>
interrupt
another
;
"
would
ye
spoil
all
with
your
imprudence
?
<EOS>
We
may
be
overhear
,
"
he
add
,
in
a
low
tone
,
and
again
the
voice
die
away
to
a
murmur
.
<EOS>
leave
them
to
the
plotting
of
their
own
dark
deed
,
we
will
now
turn
our
attention
to
another
part
of
the
cave
.
<EOS>
We
have
previously
mention
,
that
to
enter
this
retreat
,
you
must
descend
abruptly
some
fifteen
foot
.
<EOS>
this
be
do
by
mean
of
a
ladder
,
which
could
be
remove
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
at
the
foot
of
this
ladder
,
day
and
night
,
pace
a
sentinel
,
whose
imperious
order
be
to
admit
no
one
,
not
even
the
chief
himself
,
without
the
password
and
countersign
;
and
furthermore
,
should
any
individual
,
be
he
chief
or
not
,
persist
in
advance
without
give
both
pass
-
word
and
countersign
,
after
be
three
time
warn
of
the
consequence
,
it
should
be
the
duty
of
the
sentinel
to
fire
on
say
person
with
intent
to
take
life
;
in
failure
whereof
,
or
be
find
asleep
on
his
post
,
his
own
life
be
the
forfeit
.
<EOS>
for
farth
safety
against
a
sudden
attack
,
be
a
trap
door
exactly
under
the
entrance
,
so
construct
,
that
by
touch
a
secret
spring
it
would
fly
open
and
leave
an
aperture
some
fifty
foot
in
depth
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
be
sharp
stone
,
so
place
that
no
live
body
could
fall
on
them
from
above
and
survive
the
shock
.
<EOS>
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
mention
,
on
the
evening
in
question
,
pace
the
sentinel
,
with
the
steady
gait
and
regular
wheel
of
an
old
soldier
—
bear
on
his
shoulder
a
rifle
.
<EOS>
for
some
minute
nothing
be
hear
but
the
murmur
of
the
voice
already
speak
of
,
and
his
own
measured
tread
.
<EOS>
at
length
a
sound
,
like
the
plash
of
an
oar
,
fall
upon
his
ear
.
<EOS>
suddenly
pause
,
he
bend
his
head
forward
in
a
listening
attitude
;
and
then
,
as
if
satisfied
all
be
right
,
resume
his
walk
.
<EOS>
but
little
time
elapse
ere
the
sound
of
oar
be
hear
distinctly
,
and
the
hum
of
voice
from
without
.
<EOS>
directly
come
a
sound
like
the
striking
of
an
oar
three
time
flatwise
upon
the
water
,
when
the
sentinel
pause
,
and
in
a
quick
,
sharp
voice
,
sung
out:"Heta
benare?""Ele
lio
!
<EOS>
"
be
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"come
forward
and
give
the
pass
and
countersign!"A
figure
instantly
stand
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
cross
his
arm
on
his
breast
,
draw
a
dagger
from
his
belt
,
pass
it
across
his
neck
,
touch
the
point
to
his
heart
,
and
return
it
;
all
of
which
be
do
with
a
rapid
motion
,
utter
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
pass
-
word
:
"
Eliona!""All
right
—
descend
!
"
return
the
sentinel
;
and
as
the
figure
pass
down
,
another
stand
in
the
entrance
,
go
through
the
same
ceremony
,
and
be
follow
in
quick
succession
by
some
fifty
other
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
signal
be
give
that
all
have
enter
,
and
the
last
comer
take
up
his
position
as
sentinel
on
the
outside
of
the
cave
,
while
the
other
keep
his
round
within
as
usual
.
<EOS>
the
group
we
have
mention
previously
,
on
the
entrance
of
the
new
comer
disperse
and
mingle
with
them
.
<EOS>
for
some
ten
minute
there
be
a
general
hum
of
voice
,
engage
on
different
topic
,
when
suddenly
Ronald
come
forth
from
the
Chieftain
's
Chamber
,
and
all
be
silent
.
<EOS>
with
a
dignified
step
he
proceed
to
and
mount
the
platform
or
stand
,
where
he
be
greet
with
three
loud
,
hearty
cheer
.
<EOS>
as
he
listen
to
this
spontaneous
tribute
to
his
popularity
,
his
dark
eye
flash
,
a
look
of
pride
shoot
across
his
stern
,
dark
feature
,
and
raise
his
hand
to
command
silence
<EOS>
,
he
thus
address
the
assemblage:"gentleman
and
brothers:—to
me
<EOS>
,
I
must
confess
,
the
present
moment
be
a
proud
one
;
for
it
revive
the
time
when
,
with
one
universal
voice
as
it
be
,
you
proclaim
me
your
captain
—
<EOS>
give
me
,
a
stranger
,
your
confidence
;
which
you
be
aware
,
as
well
as
myself
,
be
no
less
than
place
your
life
at
my
disposal
;
and
show
that
your
confidence
in
me
be
still
unshaken
.
<EOS>
five
year
ago
,
this
night
,
I
be
elect
your
chief
;
in
do
which
you
make
my
simple
word
an
imper
ative
law
.
<EOS>
that
you
should
confer
at
a
venture
<EOS>
such
honor
,
such
absolute
rule
,
on
myself
,
on
one
you
have
never
even
prove
,
be
,
and
remain
to
this
day
with
me
a
matter
of
surprise
and
mystery
.
<EOS>
what
I
have
do
previously
to
merit
your
confidence
,
I
know
not
;
but
I
feel
at
that
moment
,
gentleman
,
that
as
you
consider
me
worthy
to
govern
you
,
I
would
throw
the
whole
strength
of
my
mind
,
would
concentrate
my
whole
thought
upon
one
theme
,
which
should
be
for
your
prosperity
;
and
to
prove
,
if
possible
,
your
confidence
not
misplace
.
<EOS>
that
I
have
succeed
,
I
feel
in
the
welcome
sound
of
your
glad
voice

<EOS>
He
pause
,
and
a
universal
shout
echo
through
the
cave
.
"For
<EOS>
five
year
,
"
he
resume
,
"
I
have
be
your
leader
;
and
by
this
mean
,
as
you
be
well
aware
,
have
make
myself
an
outlaw
,
and
a
price
have
be
set
on
the
head
of
the
bandit
chief
.
<EOS>
that
I
do
not
fear
be
betray
—
that
I
do
not
fear
,
notwithstanding
this
,
to
mingle
in
society
,
even
where
danger
be
the
most
apparent
—
you
,
gentleman
,
from
my
action
,
can
bear
ample
witness
:
but
,
gentleman
,
in
regard
to
this
matter
for
the
future
,
I
would
ask
a
favor
.
<EOS>
"You
be
aware
,
at
least
most
of
you
,
that
three
year
ago
I
marry
Inez
Orlandi
—
a
lady
of
noble
descent
,
<EOS>
whose
self
-
sacrifice
love
be
such
that
she
choose
life
with
me
,
a
bandit
,
rather
than
a
high
destiny
—
or
at
least
what
the
world
would
term
a
high
—
with
another
.
<EOS>
since
then
,
gentleman
,
as
you
have
doubtless
perceive
,
I
have
never
be
the
same
being
—
have
never
take
the
same
interest
in
the
rough
sport
of
our
wild
life
.
<EOS>
to

night
you
again
choose
a
leader
for
another
five
year
;
and
the
favor
I
would

<EOS>
again
he
pause
,
and
the

the

the
stillness

by
surprise

await
the
answer
of
his

<EOS>
Ronald
cast
a
hurried
glance
over
the
assemblage
,
and
read
in
their
grave
and
sadden
countenance
,
as
one
use
to
read
the
thought
of
the
heart
by
the
feature
,
that
he
would
meet
with
opposition
in

even
from

best

that

there

that
,

he

the

without

take
place

<EOS>

the
first

even
though
that
profession
be
to
gamble
or
steal
;
a
secret
satisfaction
in
know
that
in
his
line
he
be
popular
,
and
feel
himself
that
he
excel
.
<EOS>
such
thought
,
such
feeling
,
be
busy
in
the
breast
of
Ronald
,
as
his
eye
run
over
the
group
;
and
pride
and
regret
be
struggle
within
him
for
the
mastery
.
<EOS>
pride
,
that
his
service
be
hold
in
such
high
esteem
by
those
who
have
try
him
—
regret

that
he
could
not
retire
in

to
enjoy
life
with
his

the

momentary

here

<EOS>
He
could
not
look

sadden
face

at
his
loss

unmoved
;
and
with
an
animate
eye
,
and
a
flush
on
his
strongly
marked
feature

that
give
him
an
almost
noble
look
,
in
a
voice
of
some
emotion

he
say
.
<EOS>

Suffice

CHAPTER
III.THE
CRISIS
of
the
INVALID
—
<EOS>
the
STROLL
—
the
meditation
—
the
LANDSCAPE
—
the
VILLAIN
—
<EOS>
the
terrible
<EOS>
threat.it
may
be
say
and
with
truth
,
that
the
heart
in
a
great
measure
govern
the
vision
,
and
give
to
object
come
before
the
eye
their
light
and
dark
phase
.
<EOS>
but
few
stop
to
reason
and
realize
how
much
this
be
the
case
in
our
every
day
life
.
<EOS>
one
day
every
thing
we
behold
be
bright
and
joyous
,
another
day
dark
and
gloomy,—and
<EOS>
yet
the
same
heaven
be
above
us
,
the
same
earth
at
our
foot
,
the
same
sound
of
tuneful
nature
around
us
.
<EOS>
—
one
day
every
person
we
meet
wear
a
cheerful
smile
,
another
day
all
seem
to
frown
;
and
we
be
apt
to
think
,
like
the
man
,
who
,
become
intoxicate
,
regret
that
all
his
friend
be
so
,
and
wonder
much
the
very
tree
should
keep
them
company
,
while
he
walk
perfectly
sober
;
we
be
apt
,
we
say
,
to
think
all
other
at
fault
,
when
in
fact
the
whole
change
lie
with
ourself
,
and
the
discord
arise
from
our
own
heart
-
string
be
out
of
tune
.
<EOS>
the
transition
from
gloom
to
joy
be
oftentime
rapid
;
and
when
so
,
always
exhilerate
.
<EOS>
It
give
elasticity
to
all
our
movement
,
and
we
feel
run
through
our
whole
be
a
thrill
of
indiscribable
pleasure
,
almost
amount
to
intoxication
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
feeling
pervade
the
different
member
,
now
constitute
the
family
of
Webber
,
some
ten
day
from
the
precede
event
.
<EOS>
—
the
day
be
beautiful
;
one
of
those
that
ever
seem
to
harmonize
good
with
the
upreache
poetry
of
a
rejoice
heart
.
<EOS>
one
of
those
day
that
seem
to
let
Heaven
down
a
little
nearer
to
us
—
make
us
feel
as
though
we
could
love
every
thing
we
see
,
rejoice
in
every
sound
we
hear
.
<EOS>
—
the
sun
rise
in
splendor
and
pour
his
bright
beam
through
a
deep
blue
sky
,
where
not
a
cloud
float
to
intercept
his
ray
even
for
a
moment
,
like
a
young
heart
free
from
the
cloud
-
spot
of
a
yet
untried
world
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
soft
,
and
as
it
gently
float
along
,
stir
the
leave
and
kiss
the
flower
,
it
steal
the
perfume
of
the
latter
and
bore
it
on
to
refresh
all
who
should
inhale
it
.
<EOS>
the
little
bird
have
not
forget
it
be
a
joyous
day
,
and
their
sweet
song
go
up
in
gentle
chorus
to
their
maker
,
fill
the
air
with
melody
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
in
the
cottage
of
Webber
we
have
say
there
be
cheerfulness
on
every
countenance
.
<EOS>
each
move
with
an
elastic
step
and
bound
heart
,
and
each
in
their
own
way
feel
happy
.
<EOS>
perhaps
we
never
experience
happiness
equal
to
that
which
succeed
a
time
of
gloom
and
desponcy
;
and
the
reader
will
remember
we
leave
the
family
of
Webber
in
gloom
,
cause
by
the
sudden
illness
of
one
belove
by
all
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
to
infer
then
,
that
the
change
which
have
take
place
in
the
feeling
of
all
,
spring
from
the
change
for
the
well
which
have
take
place
in
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
for
nine
day
Rufus
have
lie
in
a
state
so
critical
that
life
and
death
may
be
say
to
be
in
an
equal
contest
for
the
mastery
.
<EOS>
night
and
day
a
watcher
have
stand
by
his
bedside
,
fearful
to
turn
away
for
a
moment
,
lest
the
slight
negligence
should
prove
fatal
.
<EOS>
for
several
day
and
night
his
mother
never
quit
his
side
—
watch
him
with
all
the
deep
anguish
a
mother
's
heart
can
feel
for
one
she
love
,
when
behold
that
one
rack
by
pain
she
would
give
her
own
life
to
alleviate
—
and
then
leave
only
because
wear
out
nature
force
her
to
repose
.
<EOS>
—
but
her
place
have
be
supply
by
one
,
who
,
if
she
do
not
love
him
so
deeply
,
at
least
love
him
with
a
tender
sister
's
love
.
<EOS>
yes
,
the
noble
hearted
,
gentle
Emily
Nevance
have
stand
by
his
side
,
like
some
angel
of
the
Spirit
Land
await
to
bear
him
to
the
abode
of
the
bl
;
and
what
be
strange
too
,
he
have
ever
seem
more
at
ease
,
have
ever
remain
more
quiet
when
she
be
present
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
at
time
wild
and
delirious
,
and
for
hour
would
rave
incoherently
when
she
be
absent
,
occasionally
utter
a
detach
sentence
so
as
to
be
understand
:
"
God
,
it
be
my
doom
!
<EOS>
emily
—
never
more
:
'
Tis
past
—
tis
past!"—from
<EOS>
which
those
who
hear
him
could
glean
nothing
,
save
that
there
be
some
deep
trouble
on
his
mind
,
<EOS>
some
inward
work
<EOS>
they
could
not
fathom,—but
strange
<EOS>
,
we
say
,
it
be
,
that
when
Emily
be
present
,
although
he
do
not
seem
to
recognise
her
,
he
ever
remain
quiet
;
and
sometimes
a
wan
smile
would
steal
over
his
pale
,
thin
feature
,
like
a
faint
ray
of
sunlight
linger
upon
some
decaying
structure
.
<EOS>
what
be
there
in
her
presence
that
could
so
effect
the
invalid
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
her
gentle
spirit
have
action
upon
his?—that
<EOS>
there
be
a
secret
communion
,
unknown
to
either
,
between
them
?
<EOS>
It
have
be
notice
by
Emily
,
have
be
notice
by
other
,
and
have
be
comment
on
by
the
different
member
of
the
household
—
among
whom
we
must
reckon
our
former
acquaintance
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
,
who
still
remain
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
notice
too
by
the
physician
;
but
notice
only
as
a
fact
he
could
not
account
for
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
cause
for
it
undoubtedly
;
and
perhaps
one
,
the
father
of
the
sick
one
,
have
vaguely
divine
that
cause
;
but
if
so
,
he
tell
it
not
,
and
with
the
rest
,
even
with
Emily
herself
,
it
yet
remain
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
the
evening
previous
to
the
opening
of
this
chapter
have
be
an
eventful
one
.
<EOS>
nine
day
of
anxiety
have
pass
wearily
away
,
when
the
physician
foresaw
that
a
crisis
be
at
hand
which
must
terminate
in
life
or
death
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
as
before
state
,
mark
the
effect
of
Emily
's
presence
on
the
invalid
,
and
consequently
give
order
that
in
this
trial
none
should
be
present
but
herself
—
no
,
not
even
the
mother
.
<EOS>
the
order
have
be
obey
;
but
oh
!
who
can
tell
that
mother
's
feeling
,
when
she
know
that
a
few
hour
must
decide
the
fate
of
her
darle
child
—
perhaps
to
terminate
in
death
—
and
she
not
be
with
him
to
gaze
upon
his
treasured
feature
,
nor
press
her
lip
again
to
his
in
life
?
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
year
of
agony
be
in
those
few
hour
of
suspense!on
the
evening
in
question
then,—the
ninth
from
his
attack
—
Emily
take
her
position
,
alone
,
by
the
side
of
Rufus
,
and
watch
him
with
painful
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
have
sink
into
a
deep
sleep
,
a
sleep
almost
like
death
itself
,
for
scarcely
be
his
breathing
perceptible
.
<EOS>
She
know
from
that
sleep
he
would
never
wake
,
or
wake
to
life
free
from
danger
.
<EOS>
all
be
silent
,
as
though
death
be
already
there
.
<EOS>
a
dim
light
,
stand
some
distance
back
,
give
a
twilight
shade
to
the
whole
apartment
;
and
she
could
barely
discern
the
outline
of
his
pale
,
marble
-
like
feature
,
which
she
sometimes
fancy
be
already
stiffen
in
death
.
<EOS>
as
she
occasionally
gaze
upon
him
,
an
indescribable
awe
creep
over
her
.
<EOS>
be
he
dead
—
have
his
bright
spirit
go
forever
?
<EOS>
she
would
sometimes
question
herself
;
and
then
the
thought
,
if
such
be
the
case
,
what
agony
would
be
her
to
witness
in
behold
the
anguish
of
his
mother
,
—
who
with
the
rest
of
the
occupant
be
wait
in
gloomy
silence
the
signal
from
her
to
weep
or
rejoice
—
make
her
feel
more
gloomy
and
depressed
.
<EOS>
thus
pass
two
hour
—
two
long
try
hour
—
and
yet
no
change
;
the
sufferer
have
move
not
,
and
she
begin
to
fancy
his
spirit
have
pass
quietly
away
.
<EOS>
with
a
tremble
hand
she
raise
the
light
,
approach
,
and
hold
it
near
his
feature
.
<EOS>
—
all
be
calm
—
he
do
not
seem
to
breathe
.
<EOS>
She
bend
down
her
head
,
but
could
hear
no
sound
indicate
life
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
go
,
"
she
think
,
and
tear
of
anguish
fill
her
eye
;
and
as
she
raise
her
head
,
a
drop
fall
on
his
cheek
.
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
of
itself
,
and
yet
,
as
it
have
be
the
Promethean
spark
,
the
invalid
start
,
draw
a
long
breath
,
open
his
eye
,
fix
them
intently
upon
Emily
,
who
stand
perfectly
motionless
,
fearful
lest
in
his
weak
state
<EOS>
a
sudden
move
may
prove
fatal
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
gaze
upon
her
with
a
sign
of
recognition
in
his
intelligent
feature
,
and
then
pass
his
hand
across
his
eye
,
as
one
assure
himself
whether
he
be
dream
or
not
.
<EOS>
again
he
gaze
upon
her
intently
,
and
a
bright
flush
mount
his
cheek
,
as
he
said:"emily
,
be
it
you
,
or
a
spirit
I
behold?""thank
God
,
he
be
safe
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculate
Emily
,
clasp
her
hand
and
look
upward
,
while
tear
of
joy
steal
down
her
sweet
feature
;
and
bend
over
,
she
press
her
lip
to
his
forehead
.
<EOS>
"O
,
Emily
,
be
this
reality
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Rufus
,
with
a
thrill
of
joy
light
up
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
—
"
o
say
it
be
not
a
dream!""it
<EOS>
be
no
dream
,
Rufus
,
"
say
she
,
look
tenderly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"Then
I
have
be
dream
,
"
return
he
,
gaze
slowly
around
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
sleep
long
,
and
yet
it
be
still
dark
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
come
into
this
room
.
<EOS>
how
come
I
here
,
and
why
be
you
watch
me?""You
have
be
ill
,
Rufus
,
very
ill
.
<EOS>
for
nine
day
you
have
stand
on
the
verge
of
the
grave!""Ill
—
nine
day
!
"
<EOS>
repeat
he
,
look
incredulously
,
and
place
his
hand
to
his
head
,
as
though
to
collect
his
thought
:
"
I
do
feel
weak
.
<EOS>
"
as
he
take
his
hand
down
,
it
catch
his
eye
,
and
start
at
the
sight
of
its
thin
,
bony
appearance
,
he
murmur
:
"
I
have
indeed
be
ill
.
<EOS>
but
where
be
I
take
,
Emily
?
<EOS>
I
remember
nothing
.
<EOS>
""At
<EOS>
the
door
here
,
just
as
you
have
return
from
a
search
for
me
.
<EOS>
""Search
<EOS>
for
you
,
Emily
!
"
repeat
he
,
earnestly
,
partly
raise
himself
in
bed—"a
search
for
you
!
<EOS>
then
it
be
no
dream
,
emily
,
it
be
no
dream
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
<EOS>
add
he
,
press
one
hand
to
his
forehead
,
while
a
look
of
mental
anguish
hover
on
his
feature
:
"
I
—
I
remember
now
,
it
be
no
dream
!
<EOS>
oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
that
it
be
anything
but
reality
!
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
emily
—
"
he
pause
and
fall
back
on
the
pillow
with
a
groan
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
Rufus
,
what
mean
this
?
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Emily
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"I
must
not
tell
you
—
it
be
nothing
—
it
be
over
now
,
"
he
reply
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"if
<EOS>
you
have
fear
for
me
<EOS>
,
you
perceive
I
have
safely
return
,
"
say
she
,
soothingly
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
with
another
!
"
add
he
emphatically
.
<EOS>
a
sudden
thought
flash
across
her
brain
,
but
instantly
discard
it
,
she
rejoin
:
"
<EOS>
true
,
with
another
;
but
why
should
that
trouble
you
,
Rufus
?
<EOS>
I
be
with
a
friend
,
whom
you
know
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
I
go
forth
with
Edward
Merton
and
return
with
him
.
<EOS>
what
see
you
wrong
in
that
,
Rufus?"Ero
he
could
reply
,
the
door
open
and
his
mother
softly
enter
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
voice
in
conversation
—
his
voice
—
and
her
heart
would
let
her
wait
no
longer
.
<EOS>
"O
,
mother
,
dear
mother
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Rufus
,
as
he
see
her
approaching
.
<EOS>
"God
of
mercy!—he
live
!
<EOS>
he
live
!
<EOS>
"
shriek
she
;
and
rush
forward
,
she
clasp
him
to
her
bosom
,
raise
her
eye
to
Heaven
,
and
pour
out
her
heart
in
a
prayer
of
thanksgive
to
the
Supreme
Ruler
.
<EOS>
Webber
be
next
to
enter
,
and
with
tearful
eye
he
press
his
lip
to
the
pale
cheek
of
Rufus
and
utter
:
"
God
be
praise
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
physician
follow
Webber
,
accompany
by
Bernard
and
Tyrone
;
but
all
three
pause
as
they
enter
the
apartment
—
which
we
should
have
mention
be
the
same
from
which
Curdish
escape
—
and
gaze
upon
the
scene
with
heartfelt
emotion
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
dwell
longer
here
;
suffice
,
that
that
night
be
one
of
rejoice
,
and
the
next
morning
one
,
as
we
have
show
,
well
calculated
to
add
to
the
joy
of
lightened
heart
.
<EOS>
each
rise
refresh
in
body
and
mind
;
and
the
invalid
,
as
he
gaze
forth
through
the
open
window
,
hear
the
song
of
bird
,
and
feel
the
soft
air
upon
his
waste
feature
with
a
thrill
of
delight
.
<EOS>
after
pay
Rufus
a
morning
visit
,
and
find
him
gradually
recover
,
Emily,—who
on
his
account
have
of
late
closely
confine
herself
to
the
house
—
and
as
the
morning
be
so
fine
too
—
could
not
resist
the
inclination
of
walk
abroad
to
taste
the
fresh
air
,
and
view
nature
in
all
her
loveliness
;
for
she
be
one
whose
soul
be
ever
open
to
such
delight
.
<EOS>
shortly
after
,
she
steal
quietly
away
;
and
take
a
path
which
lead
through
the
farm
of
Webber
to
the
southward
,
she
make
her
way
with
a
light
step
toward
a
gentle
eminence
,
some
half
a
mile
distant
,
which
overlook
a
beautiful
portion
of
the
country
,
and
where
she
be
will
not
to
spend
many
a
pleasant
hour
in
meditate
upon
the
handiwork
of
the
Supreme
Being
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
deep
,
inward
joy
in
her
heart
as
she
trip
along
the
wind
path
;
now
beside
field
of
grain
,
struggle
up
as
though
to
regain
what
they
have
lose
by
the
devastating
tornado
;
now
through
tall
,
rank
grass
,
where
occasionally
a
flower
may
be
see
peep
forth
,
like
a
modest
maiden
from
her
lattice
bower
;
now
through
bush
rejoice
in
beautiful
foliage
,
where
the
little
bird
make
their
nest
and
sing
their
songs:—there
be
deep
,
inward
joy
in
her
heart
,
we
say
,
as
she
trip
along
;
a
sweet
,
dreamy
sensation
of
delight
,
such
as
she
have
not
feel
before
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
the
mind
of
Emily
be
one
of
those
deep
,
pure
,
earnest
,
sensitive
one
,
that
in
a
measure
take
their
coloring
from
those
around
them
,
as
the
chameleon
from
the
object
with
which
it
come
in
contact
.
<EOS>
not
that
she
be
fickle
,
vacilate
,
govern
only
by
the
opinion
of
those
whose
word
fall
last
upon
her
ear
:
<EOS>
no
,
by
no
means
;
for
in
this
respect
she
could
be
sway
only
by
the
good
of
reasoning
;
but
she
be
one
of
those
who
be
full
of
soul
and
feeling
,
and
she
be
act
upon
by
the
feeling
of
other
.
<EOS>
naturally
of
buoyant
spirit
,
full
of
vivacity
and
cheerfulness
,
she
delight
to
see
every
one
around
her
in
the
same
mood
—
every
one
happy
;
and
she
could
not
rejoice
,
could
not
be
gay
,
where
she
know
another
be
in
grief
,
or
any
way
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
quick
,
energetic
,
but
full
of
sympathy
;
and
the
latter
noble
virtue
be
,
perhaps
,
her
rule
passion
.
<EOS>
hence
,
while
she
know
that
one
of
the
family
with
whom
she
have
be
reared,—to
whom
,
for
their
kindness
,
she
feel
she
owe
such
a
debt
of
gratitude
,
and
one
too
whom
she
love
with
all
the
earnest
affection
of
a
sister
—
be
lie
in
such
a
critical
state
,
with
death
stare
him
in
the
face
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
feel
happy
—
could
not
remove
the
weight
of
anguish
that
lie
like
lead
upon
her
heart
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
case
be
alter
.
<EOS>
with
his
return
to
reason
and
convalescence
,
return
her
buoyant
,
joyous
spirit
,
—
rise
just
in
proportion
to
their
long
and
severe
depression
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
day
too
,
above
all
other
,
that
she
love
,
and
every
thing
seem
to
conspire
to
make
her
happy
.
<EOS>
thus
,
for
a
time
,
as
we
have
say
,
she
trip
along
with
a
gay
air
—
gaze
with
delight
upon
the
scene
around
her,—occasionally
stop
to
pluck
a
flower
that
please
her
fancy
,
to
be
weave
into
a
garland
for
the
sick
one
,
with
whom
as
yet
her
gentle
thought
be
mostly
occupy
.
<EOS>
suddenly
her
mind
turn
into
another
channel
—
a
shade
stole
over
her
sweet
feature
,
and
her
step
grow
tardy
.
<EOS>
the
cause
be
a
natural
and
simple
one
.
<EOS>
by
one
of
those
sudden
flash
which
an
active
temperament
be
subject
to
,
the
night
of
the
storm
and
her
capture
rise
up
before
her
;
and
for
a
moment
all
the
wild
feeling
of
that
terrible
time
come
back
with
the
vividness
of
reality
;
and
what
seem
strange
too
,
this
have
never
occur
before
.
'
<EOS>
tis
true
she
have
think
of
it
at
time
;
but
then
her
thought
have
be
vague
and
transitory,—for
grief
be
at
her
heart
for
the
welfare
of
one
she
too
much
esteem
to
think
of
herself
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
case
be
different
,
—
there
be
no
strong
emotion
to
throw
aside
those
scene
of
alarm
and
terror
,
and
they
come
back
with
startling
force
.
<EOS>
She
see
again
the
old
hut
,
where
she
and
Merton
have
remain
during
that
terrific
storm
;
she
see
the
old
woman
stand
before
her
,
with
her
wild
look
,
rapid
gesticulation
—
hear
her
prophetic
word
of
warning
,
and
feel
a
kind
of
awe
creep
over
her
.
<EOS>
She
remember
her
feeling
too
,
while
go
through
that
lonely
pass
—
her
seizure
by
Riley
,
and
wild
ride
to
the
river
—
her
interview
with
the
old
Jew
—
her
despair
,
when
pinion
in
the
grasp
of
his
villainous
subordinate
;
and
,
finnally
,
the
sweet
charm
of
her
release
by
the
one
of
all
other
whom
she
love
.
<EOS>
as
her
train
of
thought
lead
emily
to
think
of
Edward
,
she
dwell
for
a
time
upon
his
noble
,
generous
nature
—
his
win
way
,
and
deep
,
ardent
love
for
her
;
love
which
she
feel
—
may
return
—
and
both
be
happy
,
but
for
the
disparity
in
their
position
as
view
by
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
see
him
an
only
heir
of
a
rich
,
aristocratic
father
,
whom
she
have
every
reason
to
believe
would
oppose
any
other
than
a
wealthy
alliance
for
his
son
.
<EOS>
She
fear
too
,
even
if
consent
be
gain
to
their
union
,
the
opposition
Edward
would
have
to
encounter
,
in
this
respect
,
would
tend
to
weaken
those
tie
of
affection
which
now
bind
him
so
strongly
to
her
,
and
make
him
regret
,
in
secret
at
least
—
for
she
believe
him
of
too
generous
and
noble
a
nature
to
show
it
openly
—
that
he
have
ever
seek
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
one
of
those
intuitive
one
that
pierce
below
the
polished
surface
and
read
the
human
heart
as
it
be
,
with
its
good
and
bad
part
commingle
;
and
she
feel
,
however
much
she
may
love
him,—and
<EOS>
love
him
<EOS>
she
certainly
do
—
<EOS>
she
must
,
as
a
duty
to
him
,
in
secure
his
happiness
,
discourage
his
suit
.
<EOS>
as
these
thought
come
up
before
her
,
with
all
the
force
of
her
good
sense
of
propriety
,
her
feature
grow
sad
,
and
her
head
droop
with
a
pensive
air
.
<EOS>
and
then
Emily
's
mind
revert
to
herself
—
her
humble
condition
—
a
dependant
upon
the
charity
of
other
.
<EOS>
who
be
she
?
<EOS>
She
have
often
hear
Webber
relate
the
story
of
how
she
become
an
inmate
of
his
house
—
a
member
of
his
family
—
and
there
be
a
mystery
about
it
which
trouble
her
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
be
of
low
birth
,
an
offspring
of
guilt
,
and
consequently
no
mate
for
Edward
Merton
,
even
set
wealth
aside
;
and
this
reflection
but
make
her
feeling
more
sad
and
painful
.
<EOS>
from
this
her
mind
again
return
to
her
capture
,
and
the
conversation
she
have
overhear
between
Riley
and
the
Jew
,
regard
herself
.
<EOS>
She
remember
Riley
's
assertion
that
there
be
some
secret
connect
with
her
birth
,
and
the
answer
of
the
Jew
by
ask
him
how
he
have
find
that
out
;
and
also
Riley
's
remark
that
he
would
make
money
by
marry
her
,
by
which
a
ray
of
hope
spring
up
that
she
may
be
of
good
descent
,
perhaps
one
of
a
wealthy
family
.
<EOS>
and
then
her
wonder
how
the
Jew
,
if
such
be
the
case
,
should
know
any
thing
of
this
;
and
if
not
,
why
he
should
wish
to
seize
upon
her
person
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
get
hold
of
proof
—
some
paper
or
paper
which
would
establish
right
wrongfully
wrest
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
of
such
thing
happen
to
other
—
may
they
not
happen
to
herself
?
<EOS>
and
then
the
mysterious
note
Webber
have
receive
some
five
year
ago
,
accompany
with
money
,
charge
him
to
educate
her
for
any
station
in
society:—what
<EOS>
do
that
mean
?
<EOS>
be
there
not
some
connection
between
that
and
the
knowledge
possess
by
the
Jew
?
<EOS>
as
these
thought
come
to
her
,
overwhelm
as
they
be
by
mystery
,
hope
revive
that
some
day
this
mystery
would
be
clear
up
,
and
she
perhaps
would
then
stand
fair
before
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
then
again
,
how
be
this
to
be
do
?
<EOS>
what
probability
be
there
that
such
,
even
if
her
surmise
be
correct
,
would
ever
take
place
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
admit
to
herself
that
,
at
the
good
,
this
be
but
a
wild
speculation
—
a
vision
of
the
brain
—
a
sort
of
castle
in
the
air
affair
,
without
form
or
substance
;
in
fact
,
but
little
less
than
an
impossibility
;
and
again
all
hope
of
such
a
termination
die
away
,
leave
her
if
any
thing
more
in
the
dark
,
more
in
gloom
,
for
the
faint
gleam
which
have
for
a
moment
shone
upon
her
.
<EOS>
thus
muse
to
herself
upon
the
various
matter
record
,
Emily
come
to
a
rough
fence
,
which
shut
in
the
field
of
culture
,
and
run
along
at
the
base
of
the
hill
or
eminence
previously
mention
.
<EOS>
the
slight
incident
at
time
be
enough
to
change
the
current
of
our
thought
;
and
as
Emily
look
up
at
this
interruption
to
her
progress
,
and
mark
the
loveliness
of
every
thing
around
,
she
feel
a
sweet
thrill
of
pleasure
steal
through
her
vein
,
and
all
her
gloomy
feeling
emerge
into
an
intellectual
enthusiasm
for
the
beauty
of
nature
.
<EOS>
cross
the
fence
,
she
move
at
a
quicken
pace
up
the
hill
,
whose
brow
be
some
hundred
yard
distant
,
and
there
pause
to
gaze
with
rapture
upon
the
beautiful
landscape
spread
out
before
her
.
<EOS>
the
scene
now
bring
to
her
view
<EOS>
be
indeed
a
delightful
one
,
and
one
worthy
of
a
description
.
<EOS>
the
summit
of
the
hill
itself
be
shade
by
a
pleasant
grove
of
tree
,
underneath
which
be
several
large
,
flat
rock
—
form
to
one
weary
of
walk
various
tempting
seat
for
repose
.
<EOS>
beside
one
of
these
rock
be
a
large
old
oak
,
which
,
although
now
fast
verging
to
decay
,
still
bear
on
its
aged
limb
a
goodly
covering
of
foliage
.
<EOS>
this
,
of
all
other
,
be
Emily
's
fa
vorite
spot
;
and
after
pause
for
a
moment
,
she
approach
and
spring
lightly
upon
the
stone
.
<EOS>
from
this
her
range
of
vision
be
somewhat
extended
;
for
be
on
the
farth
line
of
the
hill
from
her
approach
,
she
could
command
a
view
of
its
base
to
the
southward
.
<EOS>
the
hill
,
in
this
direction
,
be
unlike
its
northern
aspect
—
be
more
rough
and
precipitous
,
and
more
densely
shade
by
a
growth
of
shrubby
tree
;
if
,
in
fact
,
they
may
be
allow
the
appellation
of
tree
at
all
.
<EOS>
directly
at
its
base
,
however
,
be
some
of
a
large
kind
,
which
have
struggle
up
among
rock
and
bush
,
like
ambitious
man
to
overlook
their
fellow
.
<EOS>
ripple
along
at
the
root
of
these
,
over
a
rough
bed
,
be
the
Maramee
—
a
glimpse
and
sound
of
whose
limpid
water
could
both
be
see
and
hear
from
where
Emily
stand
.
<EOS>
on
the
opposite
side
of
this
stream
rise
another
hill
to
about
the
same
height
—
be
also
similar
in
appearance
to
the
one
just
describe
.
<EOS>
beyond
this
latter
,
to
the
southward
,
the
land
be
low
for
a
considerable
distance
,
so
that
the
next
object
which
meet
the
eye
be
the
dim
outline
of
a
range
of
mountain
far
away
.
<EOS>
to
the
left
,
or
eastward
,
the
eye
could
follow
the
bed
of
the
river
between
these
hill
for
something
like
a
mile
,
when
the
view
be
again
cut
off
by
a
sudden
turn
in
its
course
—
appear
to
the
observer
as
though
the
two
ridge
meet
and
form
an
oval
termination
.
<EOS>
from
this
all
trace
of
the
opposite
hill
be
lose
;
but
the
one
on
which
Emily
stand
could
be
see
make
an
angle
of
some
forty
-
five
degree
,
and
shoot
off
in
a
serpentine
manner
to
the
northeast
—
form
,
in
fact
,
the
same
ridge
,
a
part
of
which
we
describe
in
the
commencement
of
our
story
.
<EOS>
about
half
way
from
where
Emily
stand
to
the
angle
mention
,
be
a
small
elevation
,
bear
a
few
point
west
of
north
,
run
past
Webber
's
cottage
,
some
little
distance
to
the
east
,
and
form
the
hill
from
which
be
first
descry
the
approach
of
Bernard
and
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
turn
to
the
west
and
south
,
the
scene
present
be
by
far
the
most
extended
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
a
few
hundred
yard
to
the
westward
,
the
hill
or
ridge
we
have
be
describe
make
a
handsome
curve
to
the
left
,
leave
the
vision
free
scope
over
rather
a
level
country
for
a
goodly
number
of
mile
—
now
touch
on
a
strip
of
prairie
,
now
upon
a
dark
,
heavy
wood
—
relieve
here
and
there
by
a
glimpse
of
some
cottage
,
whose
light
blue
smoke
curl
slowly
upward
in
the
morning
sun
give
a
pleasing
sensation
of
domestic
happiness
,
and
whose
clearing
around
tell
that
settlement
and
civilization
be
slowly
creep
into
the
late
abode
of
the
savage
and
wild
beast
.
<EOS>
to
the
north
,
pass
over
the
farmer
-
like
appearance
of
Webber
's
field
of
grain
,
mow
lot
,
pasture
ground
—
his
orchard
,
garden
,
dwelling
,
stabling
—
all
of
which
cause
the
eye
to
linger
awhile
,
and
particularly
Emily
's
,
with
a
quiet
sensation
of
pleasure,—passe
over
these
,
we
say
,
in
a
northern
direction
,
some
eight
or
ten
mile
distant
,
the
eye
fall
upon
what
appear
a
long
narrow
strip
of
silver
;
but
which
a
close
examination
would
have
prove
to
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
small
portion
of
the
deep
,
dark
,
rapid
,
muddy
Missouri
.
<EOS>
occasionally
,
throughout
the
landscape
,
some
small
stream
wind
about
here
and
there
,
appear
like
silver
thread
throw
carelessly
upon
a
carpet
,
add
their
little
to
the
perfection
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
such
,
reader
,
be
but
an
imperfect
sketch
of
the
country
in
the
vicinity
of
Emily
's
new
home
,
and
the
scene
which
she
now
gaze
upon
with
feeling
know
only
to
the
lover
of
nature
and
the
beautiful
.
<EOS>
if
we
have
fail
in
attempt
to
bring
to
the
view
of
the
reader
a
picture
of
what
Emily
see
—
and
we
feel
we
have
—
for
what
be
description
after
all
,
but
description
;
and
how
far
short
it
fall
of
the
reality
—
of
those
thousand
little
thing
which
in
themselves
be
nothing
,
but
which
be
needful
in
make
up
the
whole,—if
we
have
fail
,
we
say
,
in
describe
what
she
see
,
we
utterly
despair
of
give
the
sound
she
hear
—
the
rustling
of
the
leave
,
the
murmur
of
the
streamlet
,
the
humming
of
the
insect
,
the
singing
of
the
bird
,
the
ten
thousand
,
in
fact
,
indescribable
voice
by
which
nature
complete
her
inimitable
song
of
harmony
.
<EOS>
but
let
these
pass
;
suffice
that
she
see
and
hear
enough
to
hold
her
too
much
enrapture
to
notice
the
approach
of
another
—
a
tall
dark
figure
—
who
,
find
her
attention
so
much
occupied
,
come
to
a
pause
a
few
foot
distant
,
and
deliberately
fold
his
arm
on
his
breast
,
stand
for
some
moment
regard
her
in
silence
,
but
evidently
with
no
ordinary
feeling
.
<EOS>
We
have
say
he
be
a
tall
dark
figure
;
but
in
the
latter
adjective
,
dark
,
we
have
reference
only
to
his
complexion
and
the
expression
of
his
feature
,
which
be
of
a
sinister
cast
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
black
,
but
of
that
peculiar
black
which
be
most
repulsive
,
and
be
shade
by
thick
,
overhanging
brow
,
that
give
them
at
all
time
a
look
of
sullen
fierceness
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
further
remarkable
in
his
countenance
,
unless
a
few
singularly
draw
line
near
his
mouth
,
indicative
of
a
determination
to
carry
out
whatever
design
he
may
attempt
,
and
a
peculiar
smile
,
sometimes
see
,
but
a
smile
so
devilish
that
those
who
see
never
forgot
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
young
,
or
at
least
exceed
not
twenty
-
four
year
,
and
in
person
well
and
even
handsomely
form
.
<EOS>
His
dress
be
rather
careless
,
consist
of
coarse
pantaloon
fasten
around
the
waist
by
a
leather
belt
—
a
coarse
shirt
,
open
about
the
neck
—
a
sailor
-
like
jacket
—
a
light
straw
hat
and
heavy
boot
.
<EOS>
for
some
moment
he
stand
regard
Emily
with
a
strange
look
—
the
look
of
one
who
have
resolve
upon
a
certain
result
,
yet
be
almost
undetermined
how
to
proceed
,
should
all
not
succeed
to
his
hope
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
a
look
of
tenderness
mingle
with
a
heavy
frown
,
as
though
nature
have
rouse
to
combat
two
opposite
passion
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
Emily
stand
gaze
upon
the
landscape
with
a
bright
eye
and
pleasing
smile
;
but
whether
her
thought
be
now
on
what
she
see
,
or
appear
to
see
,
or
whether
they
have
wander
away
to
the
one
she
love
,
we
shall
not
stop
to
analyze
;
though
we
may
,
perhaps
,
true
to
nature
,
premise
the
latter
.
<EOS>
at
length
she
start
,
as
by
some
sudden
thought
,
and
turn
a
little
,
start
again
on
behold
the
person
we
have
describe
.
<EOS>
there
seem
a
sort
of
revulsion
at
once
in
her
feeling
;
for
the
blood
in
her
cheek
return
to
her
heart
,
leave
them
pale
,
as
though
a
presentiment
of
trouble
have
come
over
her
,
and
in
spite
of
herself
she
tremble
.
<EOS>
this
be
but
momentary
however
,
for
the
next
instant
she
be
calm
;
and
as
if
half
ashamed
of
thus
betray
herself
,
and
the
more
perfectly
to
regain
her
composure
,
or
secrete
her
real
thought
,
she
say
with
laugh:"Well
<EOS>
,
I
declare
,
John
,
I
hope
you
be
more
successful
with
the
lady
generally
,
on
your
first
appearance
,
for
I
must
own
you
frighten
me
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
be
something
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
and
manner
of
speak
,
notwithstanding
her
laugh
and
familiar
language
,
that
appear
force
and
unnatural
,
which
John
Webber
—
for
such
the
reader
have
doubtless
divine
him
to
be
—
notice
.
<EOS>
He
have
notice
too
her
sudden
start
when
she
first
beheld
him
—
her
paleness
—
her
tremulous
agitation
—
in
fact
,
nothing
have
escape
him
;
but
he
have
attribute
to
all
these
a
very
different
cause
from
the
real
one
,
and
he
answer
accordingly:"I
do
not
intend
to
frighten
you
,
Emily
;
though
I
presume
a
pleasant
surprise
be
not
in
the
end
a
disagreeable
fright?""true
,
it
be
not
,
"
answer
Emily
,
who
feel
relieved
that
he
have
not
see
her
repugnance
to
him
;
for
it
be
against
her
gentle
disposition
to
wound
the
feeling
of
any
;
and
although
there
ever
have
be
in
his
nature
something
dark
and
uncongenial
with
her
own
,
a
something
to
make
her
feel
reserve
and
oppress
in
his
presence
,
yet
she
have
never
forget
he
be
the
son
of
her
benefactor
,
and
have
always
strive
to
keep
her
feeling
under
,
to
appear
if
anything
more
happy
than
usual
that
he
may
not
detect
it
.
<EOS>
in
this
she
have
over
act
,
as
be
sometimes
the
case
;
or
rather
,
we
may
say
,
overreach
herself
;
for
have
she
show
more
of
her
real
feeling
<EOS>
,
it
have
doubtless
be
well
for
her
in
the
end
—
have
save
her
many
a
bitter
pang
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
to
make
him
think
her
not
displeased
in
his
company
,
she
have
,
without
intend
it
,
force
him
to
think
his
company
more
agreeable
to
her
than
other
.
<EOS>
perfectly
reckless
in
all
moral
principle
,
careless
about
search
for
cause
,
he
stop
at
effect
,
and
look
upon
everything
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
without
any
distinct
notion
of
love
,
congeniality
of
soul
,
and
the
like
,
he
have
form
a
resolve
in
his
own
mind
that
emily
some
day
should
become
his
wife
.
<EOS>
a
resolve
with
him
be
almost
the
same
thing
as
a
certainty
,
for
he
never
count
on
a
failure
;
and
have
once
set
it
down
as
a
fact
,
he
rarely
ever
think
again
upon
it
,
until
the
time
come
round
for
its
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
the
resolve
concern
Emily
he
have
make
some
three
month
after
her
arrival
from
New
York
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
and
appearance
have
strike
him
then
as
belong
to
no
ordinary
person
,
and
from
think
of
this
a
fancy
have
spring
up
that
she
would
suit
him
better
than
any
woman
he
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
this
with
him
be
enough
;
and
without
intimate
it
to
her
,
or
ascertain
her
feeling
on
the
subject
,
he
have
drop
it
,
with
the
idea
that
all
be
settle
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
have
he
be
of
a
different
temperament
,
he
would
doubtless
have
feel
uneasy
at
the
attention
which
he
could
not
avoid
see
be
pay
her
by
Merton
,
and
her
apparent
pleasure
while
in
his
company
.
<EOS>
but
this
with
him
be
a
matter
of
course
affair
,
and
he
never
give
it
a
thought
;
or
,
if
he
do
,
it
be
only
to
smile
to
himself
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
to
use
an
old
proverb
,
"
you
be
reckon
without
your
host
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
another
than
him
,
too
,
would
have
feel
indignant
at
her
capture
,
and
would
have
revenge
himself
perhaps
on
the
actor
in
that
scene
;
but
he
never
suffer
a
word
to
escape
him
concern
it
.
<EOS>
true
,
he
do
not
know
of
it
till
after
her
release
—
have
be
out
that
evening
,
as
be
customary
with
him
,
till
somewhat
late
.
<EOS>
on
his
return
he
have
find
the
family
up
in
a
state
of
agitation
,
occasion
by
the
event
which
have
happen
,
and
the
sickness
of
his
brother
Rufus
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
the
whole
apparently
unmoved
;
and
learn
that
Curdish
be
a
prisoner
,
and
know
that
he
belong
to
the
bandit
,
have
watch
his
opportunity
and
set
him
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
do
for
any
love
he
bear
Curdish
,
but
merely
for
a
selfish
motive
,
by
which
alone
he
be
govern
.
<EOS>
to
gratify
self
,
or
to
get
revenge
,
which
be
only
another
species
of
self
,
he
would
go
to
any
extreme
,
do
any
act
however
devilish
.
<EOS>
some
month
previous
to
this
event
,
he
have
come
in
contact
with
several
rough
spirit
like
himself
,
and
by
an
intuitive
faculty
and
close
observation
,
have
divine
that
they
be
a
part
of
a
regular
organise
band
;
and
so
express
himself
to
them
,
accompany
by
a
request
to
admit
him
as
a
member
.
<EOS>
this
they
would
not
do
without
put
him
to
the
proof
;
and
consequently
his
liberation
of
Curdish
,
know
him
to
be
one
of
the
band
,
be
only
another
of
the
many
good
service
he
have
do
them
.
<EOS>
such
be
but
an
imperfect
insight
into
the
character
and
motive
govern
him
who
now
stand
before
Emily
Nevance
;
and
although
we
may
have
digress
somewhat
in
impart
this
information
,
yet
as
he
be
destine
to
bear
a
conspicuous
part
in
our
story
,
we
feel
it
to
be
a
matter
with
which
the
reader
should
at
once
be
make
acquainted
.
<EOS>
with
John
Webber
the
time
have
now
come
wherein
he
have
resolve
to
communicate
to
emily
his
design
of
make
her
his
partner
for
life
.
<EOS>
—
for
some
day
he
have
be
absent
from
home
,
and
be
even
that
very
morning
return
,
ponder
this
in
his
mind
,
and
how
good
to
proceed
,
<EOS>
when
on
look
up
he
be
both
surprised
and
rejoice
to
behold
the
object
of
his
musing
before
him
.
<EOS>
this
be
only
so
much
in
his
favor
,
he
think
,
and
too
good
an
opportunity
to
pass
unimproved
.
<EOS>
accordingly
he
approach
,
as
we
have
show
,
and
stand
for
some
time
regard
her
in
silence
,
with
very
curious
feeling
.
<EOS>
—
Her
surprise
and
agitation
on
see
him
he
attribute
to
the
deep
interest
she
take
in
his
welfare
;
or
what
in
another
,
who
could
have
better
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
word
,
would
have
be
term
love
;
hence
the
answer
he
make
in
reply
to
her
remark
.
<EOS>
but
to
resume
the
conversation
from
which
we
have
digress
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
after
Emily
speak
,
there
be
a
silence
,
and
feeling
unless
something
be
say
it
would
become
very
embarrassing
,
and
resolve
to
change
the
subject
,
she
resumed:"but
you
seem
to
absent
yourself
from
us
lately
,
John
;
I
have
not
see
you
for
some
day
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
Emily
,
for
some
day
I
have
be
absent
,
"
reply
he
,
still
draw
from
this
remark
a
favorable
augury
to
the
success
of
his
design
.
<EOS>
"good
news
at
home
—
<EOS>
have
you
learn
it?""No
<EOS>
,
I
be
but
<EOS>
now

my
way
there

<EOS>
"
echo
Emily
,
with
a
start
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
you
would
not
call
that
good
news
,
John?""I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
answer
he
,
color
at
the
manner
in
which
he
be
betray
himself
;
"
perhaps
I
do
not
understand
you
.
<EOS>
do
you
say
good
news?""I
do
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
Rufus

free
from
danger
and

rapidly
.
<EOS>
""Ah

<EOS>
yes
,
"
return
he
,
in
a
careless
tone
;
certainly
—
yes
—
free
from
danger
—
yes
—
that
be
good
news
.
<EOS>
"emily
<EOS>
,
notwitstanding
she
know
him
to
be
a
man
of
self
,
be
both
surprised
and
shock
at
this
unnatural
tone
of
indifference
at
the
welfare
of
an
only
brother
;
but
by
a
mighty
effort
she
manage
to
prevent
her
feeling
from
make
themselves
manifest
,
and
continued:"Yes

the
crisis
in
his
fever
come
last
night

thank
God

<EOS>
by
the
order
of
the
physician
I
stand
by

side
and
have
the
joy
of
see
him

again
to

almost
as
one
from
the
dead

<EOS>
""Joy

Emily

"
reply
John
,
with
one
of
his
devilish
smile
,
that
make
her
involuntarily
shudder
;
"
be
it
then
such
joy
to
see
him
return
to

as
you

"indeed

with

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

such
expressions!""O

he
return
,
shrug
his
shoulder
,
"
it
be
merely
a
question,—that
be
all
—
let
it
pass!""But
it
be
an
unnatural
question

rejoin
Emily
,
with
a
flushed
cheek
;

one
I
be
surprised
to
hear
one
brother
ask
concern
another!""Well

<EOS>
return
John
,
with
emphasis
,
contract
his

speak
through
his
tooth

have
my

and
he
fasten
his
dark
eye
keenly
upon
her
.
"
<EOS>
but
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
I
come
here
to
speak
on
a
different
subject
,
and
one
that
,
if
truth
must
be
tell
,
interest
me
more

<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
on

reply
Emily
,
evidently
anxious
to
finish
the
conversation
as
soon
as
possible

"
I
listen

<EOS>
""You

"
I

Emily

<EOS>
"Well

to
be

<EOS>
""Good

exclaim
Emily

stagger
back
at
this
sudden
and
altogether
unexpected
announcement
:
<EOS>
"
You

coolly

<EOS>
""But

gasp
she
.
<EOS>
"O
,

"
he
continue
,
interrupt
her
;

your
remark

know
what
you
would

"His
<EOS>
cool
impudent
manner
completely
puzzle
Emily
,
at
the
same
time
that
it
rouse
her
indignation
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
believe
him
in

yet
a
kind
of
presentiment
whisper
her

so

<EOS>
if

she
foresee
there
be
difficulty

how
to
extricate
herself

a

of
serious
reflection

<EOS>
She
see
at
once

that
in
either
case

whether
he
be
trifle

not
,
her
good
course
be
to
be
firm

""Ah

CHAPTER
IV.THE
CONVERSATION

<EOS>
the
plan
to
unravel
the
mystery

<EOS>
the
PLOT
THICKENS.The
evening

the
event

<EOS>
,
find
Webber
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone

in
the
room
to
the
right
of
the
entrance
of
the
residence
of
the
first
name
,
engage
in
close
conversation
.
<EOS>
none
of
the
other
occupant
of
the
house
be
present
—
Emily
and
Mrs.
Webber
both
be
in
the
apartment
to
the
left
with
Rufus
,
—
who
by
the
way
be
consider
gradually
recover
—
and
John
have
not
yet
return
.
<EOS>
the
conversation
of
the
trio
refer
to
have
be
carry
on
for
some
time
on
various
topic
of
little
interest
to
the
reader
,
but
just
at
the
moment
we
have
choose
to
again
introduce
them
,
it
have
take
another
turn
,
which
,
as
it
have
a
bearing
on
our
story
,
be
necessary
for
us
to
relate
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
ask
me
,
"
remark
Webber
,
in
reply
to
some
previous
question
of
Tyrone
,
"
what
I
know
of
her
history
?
<EOS>
I
answer
,
but
little
<EOS>
;
in
fact
,
absolutely
nothing
,
prior
to
her
be
leave
in
my
charge
,
the
particular
of
which
you
remember
I
give
you
some
day
or
two
since
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
very
mysterious
about
the
matter
,
and
I
would
go
to
any
expense
within
my
power
to
have
it
clear
up
.
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
I
often
grieve
for
her
;
for
although
she
in
my
presence
ever
appear
cheerful
and
contented
,
yet
I
have
watch
her
when
she
think
herself
unseen
,
and
I
know
it
trouble
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
girl
of
thought
—
very
sensitive
withal
—
and
I
know
the
obscurity
of
her
birth
must
give
her
painful
feeling
.
<EOS>
do
you
not
notice
how
pale
she
appear
on
her
return
from
her
walk
in
the
morning?""I
do
,
"
answer
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"
She
look
as
one
just
recover
from
a
terrible
fright
.
<EOS>
""I
be
alarm
myself
,
"
continue
Webber
,
"
and
think
something
serious
have
take
place
;
but
when
I
question
her
,
she
force
a
smile
upon
her
pale
feature
and
assure
me
it
be
nothing
but
a
little
dizziness
in
the
head
which
would
soon
pass

I

no

that

she
look
as

what

the
recalling
of
the
night
of

at

should
so
effect
her

<EOS>
no

no

not

perhaps
she
see

off

the

"Why

out

again

that

May
it

part

an
organise
band

who
be
act
without
the

carry
out
some
plan

ripe
for
execution

so
be
interrupt
by
him?""heaven
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Webber
,
start
<EOS>
;
"
I
think
you
be
right

<EOS>
at
least
there
have
be
a
band
of
outlaw
in
this
quarter
;
for
when
I
first
come
here
,
it
be
almost
a
daily
occurence
to
hear
of
horse
-
steal
,
robbery
,
and
even
murder
;
and
the
name
of
Ronald
Bonardi
,
the
bold
,
reckless
leader
of
this
bandit
,
be
pass
from
ear
to
ear
,
among
the
more
timid
,
with
feeling
of
superstitious
awe
and
horror
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
to
such
an
alarming
extent
be
his
depredation
carry
on
,
at
one
time
,
that
the
whole
country
become
aroused
,
private
meeting
be
hold
among
the
more
peaceable
citizen
or
settler
,
and
a
heavy
reward
be
offer
to
any
one
who
should
take
him
dead
or
alive
;
but
he
be
never
catch
.
<EOS>
It
be
suppose
he
get
information
of
their
proceeding
and
leave
this
part
of
the
country
;
for
since
that
time
,
with
but
few
exception
,
the
settler
have
remain
undisturbed
—
though
I
have
hear
of
some
few
exploit
since
,
that
smack
of
his
,

for
the
most

they
happen
east
of

at

solemnly

be

a
giant

doubtless
their
fear
make
them
exaggerate

I

in

all
—
he

that
distinguish
him
from
all

have
be
describe
by
some
as
bloodthirsty

then
,
again

other
relate

prove
him

him

somewhat
characteristic

it

your
suggestion
that
these
ruffian
be
a
part
of
an
organise
band
,
do
not
appear
so
plausible
.
<EOS>
I
should
rather
judge
them
to
be
some
low
,
desperate
character
,
employ
for
the
occasion
by
the
Jew
,
whose
reputation
as
a
cowardly
villain
be
wide
spread
.
<EOS>
the
ring
business
,
as
I
say
before
,
I
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
that
this
be
a
signal
,
understand
among
themselves
as
indicate
danger
,
and
to
forego
their
design
,
whatever
it
be
,
until
a
well
opportunity
should
present
itself
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
the
case
,
their
card
be
well
play
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
question
Merton
,
when
I
see
him
,
and
get
more
of
the
particular
.
<EOS>
""Speaking
of
these
matter
,
Webber
,
do
you
not
feel
unsafe
here
,
with
your
family
,
when
you
first
settle
,
know
that
you
be
surround
by
such
a
band
of
desperado
,
and
in
a
country
too
so
thinly
populate
that
you
would
be
likely
to
get
no
assistance
,
even
if
attack

with
no

sufficient
to
protect
either

<EOS>
enquire
Tyrone
.
"Why
<EOS>
,
such
matter
do
trouble
me
some
at
first
<EOS>
,
"
reply
Webber
;
"
and
in
consequence
of
this
I
build
my
cottage
very
strong
,
and
secure
me
some
dozen
of
good
rifle
and
plenty
of
ammunition
—
which
I
still
have
on
hand

Heaven

<EOS>
I
have
never

<EOS>
the
seizure
of
Emily

the
first
trouble
of
the
kind
that
have
ever
happen
with
any
of
my
family

and
somehow
I
have
never
look
on
this
so
seriously
as
I
do
now
;
for
since
all
the
circumstance
have
be
explain

I

there
will
be
more
trouble

not

continue
he

address
himself
more

""Rest

brightening
at

complimentary
appeal

his
courage

<EOS>
We

ourselves

at

who
be
the
instigator

actor
,
and
also
their
whereabout
at
the

<EOS>
We
will
then
take
her
along
with
us

both
as
a
guide

to
prevent
her
communicating
with
any
of

proceed
next
to

hut
of
the
old
Jew

whom
I
shall
take
into

for
further
examination

if

I

We

"
perhaps
I

myself

""But

It
have
be
too
long
delay
already

<EOS>
have
it
not
be
for
the
severe
illness
of
Rufus
,
I
should
have
enquire
into
the
matter
sooner
,

long
ere
<EOS>
this
would
have
be
like
a
blood

hound
on

<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
well

it

they
would
then

have
be
on

expecting

naturally
would

a
pursuit

now
I
trust

take

unawares

""But

ask
Tyrone

<EOS>
"no

<EOS>
I
do
not

from
the
fact

it
appear

that
the
person
of
Emily
be
what
they
seek
;

they
will
be

hover
in

you
ever

account
for

escape
of
Curdish?""No
!

<EOS>

Webber

"
I
have
not

<EOS>
that
be
another
very
mysterious
affair

have
perplex
me

no

could
have
enter
the
house
after
John
come
home

for
the
door
be
bolt
on
the
inside

and
after
that
I
look
into
the
room
,
and
see
Curdish
still
there
;
otherwise
I
should
have
suppose
he
escape
by
mean
of
a
false
key
;
but
have
he
do
so
<EOS>
,
the
outer
door
would
not
have
remain
bolt
on
the
inside
,
as
be
the
case
in
the
morning

<EOS>
what
think
you
of
it
,
John?""I
know
nothing

<EOS>
John
—

<EOS>
only
that
I
see
nothing
so
very
mysterious
concern
it

<EOS>
as
to
the
door
be
bolt

I
can
say
,
that
have
occasion
to
get
up
in
the

I
find
it

open

bolt
it
myself

curdy

may
have
have

the
contrary

such
thing
be
too
common

I
think

to
be
very
mysterious

""Why
<EOS>
,
this
explain
it
then

rejoin
Webber

<EOS>
"
why
do
you
not

this
before

John

drily

<EOS>
"Well

with

should
I
be

fortunate

at

resume

by
ask
Bernard

long
he
intend

"Wal

circumstance

<EOS>
and
you
,
Tyrone

how
be
it
with
you?""Why
,
as
Bernard
have
just
remark
,
I
come
out
here
to
examine
the
state
of
the
country
,
and
attend
to
some
professional
business
in
St.
Louis
.
<EOS>
by
profession
,
as
you
be
aware
,
I
be
a
lawyer
—
though
but
lately
admit
to
the
bar

<EOS>
I
have
an
opportunity
some
month
since
of
purchase
a
section
of
land
—
north
of
,

border
on
the
Missouri
—
which
I
embrace

<EOS>
some
time
after
,
I
receive
a
letter
from
a

in
St.

offer
me
for
it
four

the
amount
I
pay
.
<EOS>
this
excite
my
curiosity
to
know
what
have
induce
the
offer
;
and
as
I
have
a
desire
of
see
this
western
country
—
of
which
so
much
have
be
say
of
late
—
and
as
my
friend
Bernard
be
desirous
of
come
out
here
also

I
conclude
to
be
his
companion
for
the
journey

have
hear
of
you
frequently

from
various
source

Bernard
be
an
old
schoolmate

yours

determine
on
pay
you
a
visit

<EOS>
""I
be
right
glad
you
have
do
so
,
"
return
Webber
,
cordially
;
"
and
there
seem
almost
a
Providence
in
your
very
conclusion
,
from
the
fact
that
you
come
so
opportune
;
for
without
your
timely
assistance
I
know
not
what
may
have
be
the
result
of
that
knavish
affair

I
trust
you
will
consider
my
house
your
home

so
long

you
choose
to
remain
in
the
West

for
the
invaluable
service

you

already

the
plan
of
REVENGE
—
<EOS>

the
PRISONER
—
the
STRANGER
—
<EOS>

SPY.On
that
same
night
old
<EOS>
David
<EOS>
the
Jew
sit
alone
in
the
hovel
wherein
we
first
introduce
him
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
His
feature
bear
the
same
coarse
,
villainous
,
repulsive
aspect
as
then
,
and
the
apartment
the
same
dirty
,
gloomy
appearance
.
<EOS>
the
Jew
,
as
then
,
sit
by
a
sort
of
rough
table
,
whereon
stand
a
pale
,
sickly
light
of
his
own
construction
—
<EOS>
his
elbow
incline
downward
and
rest
on
it
so
as
to
support
his
head
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
—
the
light
stand
some
little
distance
before
him
,
and
its
pale
gleam
fall
on
a
countenance
where
all
the
bad
passion
of
the
human
heart
be
manifest
themselves
by
sudden
and
sometimes
awful
contortion
of
the
muscle
.
<EOS>
now
a
heavy
frown
would
gather
over
his
feature
,
like
some
black
,
portentous
cloud
over
a
dismal
swamp
,
and
his
small
black
eye
would
look
cold
and
devilish
,
and
his
shrivel
bloodless
lip
would
compress
,
and
his
low
jaw
move
as
though
he
be
endeavor
to
grate
his
tooth
.
<EOS>
now
the
expression
would
take
a
wilder
,
fiercer
and
more
fiend
-
like
aspect
,
and
his
eye
would
sparkle
with
a
strange
and
terrible
gleam
,
and
his
thin
,
bony
hand
would
clutch
at
the
air
,
as
though
he
feel
it
be
at
the
throat
of
some
victim
of
his
undying
hate
.
<EOS>
and
thus
he
sit
,
for
an
hour
,
bury
to
the
outer
world
in
the
gloom
of
his
own
dark
,
guilty
thought
,
with
his
eye
fix
on
vacancy
—
motionless
,
save
the
nervous
agitation
we
have
describe
—
alone
—
an
old
,
grey
headed
man
—
<EOS>
a
sad
and
revolting
picture
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
oh
!
who
would
wish
to
enter
to
the
depth
of
such
a
soul
and
see
its
awful
working
,
where
no

of
God

sunshine
ever

<EOS>

cold

,
as
we
have

,
for
an
hour

<EOS>
at
length
he
start
to
his
foot
,
and
with
his
old
frame
shake
with
age
and
debility
,
commence
shuffling
to
and
fro
the
apartment
,
with
his
head
bent
forward
,
and
his
tremble
hand
lock
in
each
other
behind
him
.
<EOS>
suddenly
he
pause
,
and
reach
forth
his
clenched
hand
,
shake
it
as
it
be
at
vacancy
,
while
his
countenance
assume
that
same
fierce
,
terrible
expression
.
"revenge

"
hiss
he
,
at
last
,
through
his
pale
quivering
lip
:

"
<EOS>
here
the
old
Jew
,
as
though
the
consummation
of
his
design
have
already
take
place
,
chuckle
with
a
glee
that
partake
more
of
the
nature
of
a
fiend
than
a
human
being
.
<EOS>
again
he
resumed:"Yish

<EOS>
and
the
old
Jew
rub
together
his
hand
,
and
chuckle
merrily
until
a
severe
cough
interrupt
him
.
<EOS>
"Vell
,
now
I

say
he
,
as
soon

"
cry
he
,
start
as
though
some
new
thought
have
come
over
him
suddenly
:
"
De

<EOS>

<EOS>
I

"
and
again
the
old
Jew
rub
his
bony
hand
together
and
chuckle
.
<EOS>
glance
cautiously
around
,
as
though
to
assure
himself
no
other
being
be
present
,
although
he
know
the
outer
door
be
strongly
bolt
,
and
feel
perfectly
confident
he
be
alone
,
(
such
by
the
way
be
the
force
of
habit
)
he
proceed
to
the
closet
we
have
before
have
occasion
to
notice
as
occupy
one
corner
of
the
apartment
,
and
for
a
moment
disappear
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
for
a
moment
however
;
and
when
he
return
,
he
bear
in
one
hand
a
roll
of
paper
,
and
in
the
other
a
bag
of
money
.
<EOS>
approach
with
a
feeble
step
he
deposit
both
on
the
table
,
and
then
reseat
himself
on
the
old
stool
.
<EOS>
untie
the
bag
he
pour
forth
its
content
,
and
then
for
a
few
minute
sit
and
gaze
upon
the
pile
with
the
exulting
,
avaricious
look
of
a
miser
.
<EOS>
perhaps
this
in
a
measure
be
excusable
;
for
the
pile
,
to
say
the
truth
,
be
by
no
mean
an
invaluable
one
,
and
may
have
tempt
other
of
a
less
avaricious
nature
than
the
Jew
to
eye
it
with
delight
.
<EOS>
It
be
mostly
of
gold
—
old
genuine
coin
—
many
of
them
spanish
doubloon
,
english
guinea
,
and
the
like
<EOS>
—
occasionally
intersperse
with
a
few
piece
of
silver
.
<EOS>
for
some
minute
,
we
say
,
the
old
Jew
sit
and
gaze
upon
his
treasure
,
and
then
commence
handle
each
piece
separately
,
with
a
childish
delight
—
place
each
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
or
on
the
end
of
his
finger
,
and
then
move
his
hand
up
and
down
as
though
to
ascertain
its
weight
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
pass
another
hour
—
perhaps
more
—
when
he
return
the
money
piece
by
piece
to
the
bag
,
take
due
note
of
the
exact
amount
that
none
may
be
miss
.
<EOS>
this
done
,
and
the
whole
secure
by
the
string
,
he
lay
it
gently
upon
the
table
,
take
up
the
paper
,
unrolled
and
examine
them
attentively
for
some
half
hour
more
;
when
,
as
if
satisfied
with
his
scrutiny
,
he
roll
them
together
,
and
gather
up
his
money
return
again
to
the
closet
.
<EOS>
here
,
feel
along
the
side
next
to
the
wall
,
low
down
,
he
come
to
a
kind
of
panel
,
when
touch
a
secret
spring
it
immediately
fly
open
,
disclose
a
small
iron
door
.
<EOS>
touch
another
spring
,
this
door
open
,
leave
an
aperture
into
a
small
iron
safe
,
where
the
Jew
quickly
deposit
his
money
and
paper
,
and
then
reclose
both
the
safe
door
and
panel
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
be
this
complete
,
when
a
deep
sepulchral
groan
seem
to
issue
from
beneath
him
.
"Ha
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
he
start
<EOS>
,
"
I
have

<EOS>
Vell

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
the
old
Jew
totter
back
to
the
table
,
with
a
savage
look
on
his
grim
,
ugly
feature
—
a
hellish
gleam
in
his
small
black
eye
—
and
take
up
the
light
return
once
more
to
the
closet
.
<EOS>
here
he
pause
,
and
take
from
a
narrow
shelf
a
somewhat
rusty
dagger
,
he
examine
it
attentively
for
a
moment
,
with
a
fierce
gleam
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
Dat
shall
do
mine
pusiness
,
"
he
mutter
;
and
raise
a
trap
-
door
near
his
foot
,
he
slowly
commence
his
descent
down
a
damp
,
mildewed
ladder
,
into
a
slimy
,
nauseous
vault
,
bear
the
light
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
passage
which
the
Jew
descend
be
very
narrow
,
and
be
wall
up
on
either
hand
to
prevent
the
earth
from
cave
in
.
<EOS>
in
depth
it
may
have
be
some
fifteen
foot
,
and
in
extent
some
thirty
more
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
cold
,
for
both
the
ground
and
wall
be
moist
;
and
on
the
latter
stand
large
drop
,
which
glisten
as
the
pale
gleam
of
the
light
fall
upon
them
,
like
the
eye
of
so
many
serpent
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
by
no
means
its
bad
feature
.
<EOS>
the
air
,
though
cold
,
be
close
and
heavy
;
so
much
so
as
to
be
difficult
of
respiration
;
and
be
,
besides
,
fill
with
a
stench
almost
insupportable
.
<EOS>
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
the
Jew
for
a
moment
pause
—
with
his
foot
slide
upon
what
seem
greasy
earth
—
and
then
turn
slowly
around
,
move
cautiously
along
the
passage
,
with
the
light
hold
before
him
in
one
hand
,
and
the
dagger
in
the
other
,
occasionally
rest
an
arm
against
the
wall
to
prevent
himself
from
fall
,
until
he
come
to
the
terminus
,
where
be
reveal
a
spectacle
of
the
most
piteous
,
revolt
,
and
inhuman
nature
.
<EOS>
on
a
bed
of
damp
,
filthy
straw
—
ground
into
the
earth
until
it
be
completely
coat
with
a
clayey
loam
,
and
chain
to
the
wall
—
lie
the
thin
,
sickly
,
waste
figure
of
what
have
once
be
a
powerful
man
,
now
pass
the
middle
age
of
life
.
<EOS>
He
be
scarcely
more
than
a
skeleton
.
<EOS>
His
once
strongly
mark
countenance
—
now
of
a
pale
livid
,
ghastly
hue
—
have
waste
away
until
every
bone
stand
prominent
.
<EOS>
His
cheek
have
fall
in
;
and
his
large
,
dark
eyes,—as
they
roll
in
their
hollow
,
bony
socket
,
and
gleam
out
from
between
his
long
,
grey
,
matted
,
dirty
hair
,
which
partly
screen
his
feature
—
be
sepulchral
and
awful
to
behold
.
<EOS>
His
limb
and
body
be
but
partially
cover
by
rag
of
the
most
filthy
description
,
while
—
as
if
to
complete
the
foul
picture
of
human
wretchedness
imaginable
—
rusty
iron
chain
,
fasten
around
his
ankle
,
clank
to
the
move
of
his
foot
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
prisoner
of
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
awfully
loathsome
,
heart
sickening
sight
,
which
he
now
gaze
upon
with
a
savage
joy
.
<EOS>
—
such
be
the
scene
before
him
;
but
bad
—
ay
,
bad
—
for
we
dare
not
describe
it
as
it
be
in
reality
.
<EOS>
It
would
shock
the
sense
.
<EOS>
and
who
be
this
man
?
<EOS>
and
how
come
he
there
in
the
power
of
the
Jew
?
<EOS>
let
the
sequel
of
our
story
answer
.
<EOS>
as
the
prisoner
see
the
Jew
approach
,
he
partly
raise
himself
on
one
arm
and
groan
.
<EOS>
as
the
Jew
pause
before
him
,
with
a
dagger
in
his
hand
,
and
murder
in
his
eye
,
the
prisoner
groan
again
;
and
then
in
a
deep
,
hollow
voice
,
said:"oh
,
or
God
-
sake
,
give

<EOS>
I

since

"
<EOS>
and
the
wretched
man
sink
back
upon
his
wretched
bed
with
a
second
groan
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
the
Jew
return
no
answer
,
but
stand
and
gaze
upon
him
with
a
fiendish
smile
.
<EOS>
then
he
lookod
at
his
dagger
,
and
then
he
spoke:"You
<EOS>
shall
shee

more

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
the
Jew
speak
rapidly
,
in
short
sentence
,
and
as
he
conclude
he
raise
his
weapon
and
bent
forward
in
an
attitude
to
strike
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,

groan
the
victim
,
glare
wildly
upon
him
:
"
I
be
not
ready
to
die

.
<EOS>
""he

the

,
with
a
hideous
grin

"
<EOS>
Vot

"
and
place
one
knee
on
the
ground
as
he
speak
,
he
again
raise
the
dagger
,
bend
himself
forward
,
and
with
a
rapid
motion
strike
at
the
heart
of
his
victim
.
<EOS>
but
he
fail
of
his
mark
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
who
have
be
watch
him
intently
,
gather
all
his
remain
strength
for
a
final
effort
,
mark
the
blow
as
it
descend
,
catch
his
arm
with
one
hand
,
and
with
the
other
wrench
the
weapon
from
him
.
<EOS>
so
sudden
and
so
unexpected
be
this
,
that
the
Jew
start
to
his
foot
and
retreat
some
pace
in
absolute
terror
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
he
comprehend
all
,
and
see
how
his
victim
have
foil
him
,
he
utter
a
volley
of
curse
at
his
own
stupidity
,
stamp
the
earth
with
his
foot
,
and
beat
his
head
with
his
clenched
hand
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
.
<EOS>
what
may
have
be
the
result
—
what
dark
and
inhuman
revenge
he
may
have
take
on
the
unhappy
object
before
him
—
have
nothing
occur
to
interrupt
and
draw
off
his
thought
<EOS>
—
we
do
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
just
at
this
instant
be
hear
a
noise
,
like
the

<EOS>
It
be
not

circumstance
place
it

a
man
somewhat
past

be

of

proceed
as
near

he
could
judge
from
yonder
cave

be
unarmed

alone
<EOS>
he
dare
not
go
to
the

the
more
so

he
believe
there
would
be
more
than
one

save
some
mark
of
blood

about

nothing

discover
of

never

believe

murder

his

sink
in
the
Maramee

It
be
think
by

that
the

could
tell
something

so
disposed

now
I
think

doubtless
these

""I'd

"doubtless

come
,
we
waste
time
;
let
us
to
the
spur

"accordingly
<EOS>
at
the
word
they
set
forward
at
a
rapid
gallop

through
the
ravine

turn
aside
into

come
to

not

over

it

there
may

some
of

they
doubtless

at

make

I
will

<EOS>
afore

ye

you

""Well

Harvey

what
be
it

ask
Webber

"Why
<EOS>
to
say
it
right
out
and
out
<EOS>
it
be
jest
<EOS>
this
:
—
<EOS>
You
be
somewhat
old
than
I

per'ap
be

<EOS>

""Well

Harvey

what
have
that
to
do
with

a
little
impatiently

"Why

<EOS>
this

glisten
in

I

Bernard

I
know

still
I
do
not
think
that
I
have
any

it
would

<EOS>
tis

I
have

who
would
mourn

should
I
meet

then
I

no

neither

I

<EOS>
""O
,
as
to
that
,
"
reply
Bernard
,
<EOS>
"
you
be
not
a
go
to
sacrifice
any

you
need
not

one

both

dismount

<EOS>
"I

shall
add
my

say
the

that
you
take
Bernard
's
advice

<EOS>
""well

"
answer
Webber
,
"
since
you
be
both
determined
on
this
point

why
of

I
must
acquiesce
;

do
not

venturesome

bear
in

I

""All

<EOS>
all

I

now
Mark

we
will

go
ahead

at
the
word
both
start
forward

<EOS>
the
hut
be
only
some
hundred
yard
distant
,
and
but
little
time
elapse
ere
Bernard
be
knock
on
the
door
.
<EOS>
not
receive
an
answer
to
this
,
he
press
with
considerable
force
against
it
,
when
somewhat
to
his
surprise
it
quietly
swing
back
on
its
hinge
.
<EOS>
"I
guess
the
bird
's
flew
,
"
Tyrone
,
say
he
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
pistol
in
hand
he
enter
,
follow
in
like
manner
by
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
thing
be
certain

"
return
Tyrone
,
as
have
enter
he
glance
around
the
gloomy
apartment

that
be
that
nobody

ourselves

<EOS>
""True

rejoin
Bernard
;

I
can
tell

one

they

stinking

<EOS>

Tyrone
;
"
these
certainly
be
sure
indication
of
a
party

be
here
quite
lately

perhaps
even
now
be
not

off

<EOS>
who
know
—

<EOS>
His
speech
be
here
cut
short
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
three
figure
,
whose
face
be
conceal
by
black
mask
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
by
St.
Christopher
,
we
have
get
you
now
!

<EOS>
cry
the
foremost
,
whose
left
arm
be
bandage
,
and
whom
of
course
the
reader
will
at
once
recognise
as
Curdish

<EOS>
"
You
do
not

scape
<EOS>
this
ar
'
<EOS>
perticular
time
,
you
—
Yankee
!
"
and
rush
forward
,
he
fire
a
pistol
directly
at
the
head
of
Bernard
,
who
,
though
take
by
surprise
,
and
but
a
moment
leave
for
thought
,
still
have
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
cast
his
head
aside
,
just
at
the
instant
of
the
discharge
,
by
which
mean
the
ball
slightly
graze
his
cheek
,
carry
away
a
small
portion
of
his
ear
,
and
lodge
in
the
wall
beyond
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
's
such
a
thing
as
be
mistake
in
this
ere
world
,
Mr.
Jack
Curdish
,
"
return
Bernard
,
cooly
,
follow
his
example
,
and
send
a
ball
through
the
fleshy
portion
of
the
wounded
arm
of
his
antagonist
,
near
the
shoulder
,
who
stagger
back
with
a
howl
of
rage
and
pain
,
and
gnash
his
tooth
together
in
terrible
fury
.
<EOS>
instantly
recover
himself
,
and
draw
a
long
knife
from
his
belt
,
Curdish
again
spring
forward
,
with
a
horrible
oath
,
and
aim
a
rapid
blow
at
the
heart
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
but
here
again
Bernard
's
coolness
and
dexterity
save
him
;
for
watch
the
movement
with
a
keen
,
sure
eye
,
he
spring
suddenly
aside
—
the
blow
miss
its
object
—
and
Curdish
,
who
have
throw
his
whole
force
into
it
,
fall
heavily
against
him
.
<EOS>
quick
as
think
Bernard
again
start
back
,
and
ere
the
other
have
time
to
regain
his
balance
,
with
a
tremendous
blow
he
drive
the
breech
of
the
discharge
pistol
full
in
his
face
,
destroy
his
mask
,
and
he
fall
backward
upon
the
ground
--
senseless
--
his
feature
besmear
with
blood
.
<EOS>
this
,
Bernard
be
on
the
point
of
follow
up
with
severer
measure
,
when
a
cry
,
and
a
glance
at
Tyrone
,
arrest
him
,
he
spring
quickly
to
his
relief
—
fortunately
just
in
time
to
save
his
life
.
<EOS>
whether
the
manner
of
attack
on
Bernard
and
Tyrone
be
preconcerte
,
or
whether
the
ruffian
be
govern
by
circumstance
after
their
entrance
,
we
do
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
certain
it
be
,
in
either
case
,
there
be
a
grand
oversight
in
their
proceeding
;
<EOS>
for
have
two
attack
Beruard
,
instead
of
Tyrone
,
the
result
may
have
be
more
to
their
liking
.
<EOS>
doubtless
,
curdish
,
thirst
for
revenge
,
and
feel
sure
of
his
man
,
have
choose
Bernard
for
himself
—
alone
—
expect
to
give
him
a
sudden
quietus
,
while
the
other
two
should
as
easily
despatch
his
companion
.
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
however
,
no
sooner
do
curdish
rush
towards
Bernard
—
who
be
stand
near
the
centre
of
the
room
,
and
the
farth
from
the
door
—
than
his
two
follower
,
Saxton
and
Riley
,
turn
upon
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
Saxton
be
the
foremost
of
the
two
,
instantly
snap
a
pistol
at
the
breast
of
Tyrone
,
which
fortunately
miss
fire
,
when
Tyrone
,
see
how
matter
stand
,
and
know
his
life
depend
upon
his
great
exertion
,
discharge
each
of
his
pistol
in
quick
succession
,
but
with
no
other
effect
than
that
of
slightly
wound
Riley
in
the
head
.
<EOS>
perceive
his
failure
—
owe
to
his
haste
—
and
know
there
be
not
a
moment
to
be
lose
,
as
his
enemy
be
close
upon
him
,
he
take
one
step
backward
,
and
then
suddenly
bound
into
the
air
,
plant
both
foot
against
the
breast
of
Saxton
with
such
tremendous
force
that
he
fall
back
upon
Riley
,
who
,
not
be
prepare
for
the
shock
,
be
throw
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
follow
up
this
slight
advantage
,
Tyrone
instantly
draw
his
knife
and
make
a
pass
at
Saxton
's
throat
,
who
catch
his
arm
with
a
mighty
grasp
,
as
the
blow
be
in
progress
,
and
then
close
in
with
,
endeavor
to
wrench
the
weapon
from
him
,
or
get
an
opportunity
to
draw
his
own
.
<EOS>
Saxton
,
although
a
powerful
man
,
and
far
superior
to
Tyrone
in
size
and
strength
,
be
yet
greatly
his
inferior
in
supleness
and
science
;
and
take
advantage
of
his
knowledge
of
wrestling
,
Tyrone
have
no
sooner
fairly
close
in
with
him
,
than
by
a
dexterous
movement
he
coil
his
leg
around
the
other
's
,
take
a
sudden
lock
,
and
throw
him
upon
his
back
with
tremendous
violence
—
<EOS>
himself
fall
uppermost
.
<EOS>
Ere
he
could
make
use
of
this
advantage
,
Saxton
seize
upon
the
rifle
which
be
still
attach
to
Tyrone
's
shoulder
—
one
hand
on
either
side
—
and
by
this
mean
draw
him
down
with
so
close
a
hug
,
that
his
breath
be
completely
suspend
,
and
all
power
of
action
.
<EOS>
Riley
have
by
this
time
regain
his
foot
;
and
on
a
call
from
Saxton
to
release
him
by
kill
Tyrone
,
and
somewhat
enrage
at
his
own
wound
and
fall
,
he
draw
a
pistol
,
cock
,
present
it
to
his
head
,
and
his
finger
be
already
pull
upon
the
trigger
,
when
Bernard
,
who
have
see
the
movement
in
time
to
reach
him
,
suddenly
hurl
him
backward
,
by
which
mean
the
muzzle
be
elevate
sufficiently
,
as
it
go
off
,
to
clear
the
head
of
Tyrone
,
and
bury
the
ball
in
the
earth
a
few
foot
beyond
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
try
that
be
motion
again
soon
,
I
guess
,
"
remark
Bernard
,
cooly
,
as
he
deliberately
draw
his
other
pistol
,
point
it
at
the
head
of
Riley
,
and
glance
steadily
along
the
barrel
.
<EOS>
"
take
that
for
your
pain
!
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
and
with
the
word
come
a
sharp
report
.
<EOS>
Riley
bound
from
the
earth
,
with
a
shriek
,
and
fall
dead
at
his
foot
—
his
forehead
pierce
by
a
ball
.
<EOS>
His
presentiment
have
prove
too
true
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
come
the
report
of
a
rifle
,
and
a
cry
from
without
.
<EOS>
Bernard
start
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
—
Webber
be
evidently
attack
—
perhaps
kill
.
<EOS>
no
time
be
to
be
lose
.
<EOS>
unslinge
his
rifle
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
,
he
deal
Saxton
so
powerful
a
blow
with
the
breech
,
that
his
hold
instantly
relaxed
,
leave
Tyrone
free
.
<EOS>
"Up
,
Mark
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Bernard
;
"
I
guess
there
be
more
work
on
hand
out
<EOS>
o
'
door
;
"
and
without
pause
longer
he
rush
forth
,
follow
by
Tyrone
,
both
of
whom
make
all
haste
possible
to
where
Webber
have
be
leave
with
the
horse
.
—
<EOS>
here
,
much
to
their
joy
,
they
find
Webber
,
rifle
in
hand
,
in
company
with
Edward
Merton
,
who
have
just
arrive
and
dismount
from
his
horse
,
which
he
still
hold
by
the
bridle
.
<EOS>
"Thank
<EOS>
God
,
friend
,
you
be
safe
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Webber
,
joyfully
,
as
they
approach
,
extend
a
hand
to
each
,
while
Merton
do
the
same
:
<EOS>
"
I
fear
you
be
kill
,
as
I
hear
the
report
of
several
pistol
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
we
have
have
a
putty
considerable
rough
time
on't

"
say
Bernard
in
reply
;
"
but
I
guess
as
how
them
be

have
have
a
rougher
—
though
one
on

I
do
not

<EOS>
ask
Webber
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"Wal
<EOS>
I
rather
guess
as
how
one
on
'em
will
be
gitte
cold
afore
long
,
"
he
answer
;
"
at
least
that
be
my
candid
opinion
about
it
;
but
I
think
there
be
a
fuss
out
here
,
for
I
heerd
a
gun
go
off
,
and
heerd
somebody
holler
like
too
,
or
my
ear
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
yes
,
"
return
Webber
,
"
there
be
some
trouble
here
a
few
minute
since
;
but
thank
to
the
timely
arrival
of
friend
Edward
,
here
,
nothing
serious
have
happen
on
our
part
,
though
whether
the
other
side
escape
as
scatheless
be
somewhat
doubtful
.
<EOS>
""then
<EOS>
you
be
attack
also
?
"
say
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"I
be
,
"
answer
Webber
.
<EOS>
"
Scarcely
have
you
enter
the
hut
,
and
while
I
be
anxiously
look
in
that
direction
,
anticipate
difficulty
for
you
,
two
man
creep
stealthily
behind
and
instantaneously
seize
me
,
one
hold
of
either
arm
,
which
they
cross
upon
my
back
.
<EOS>
I
make
a
sudden
spring
forward
,
but
I
be
not
what
I
once
be
I
find
,
and
they
be
both
strong
man
and
hold
me
firmly
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
I
see
three
ruffian
enter
the
hut
,
and
immediately
hear
several
report
of
firearm
in
quick
succession
,
and
believe
that
all
be
over
with
both
of
you
;
for
take
as
you
be
by
surprise
,
I
do
not
deem
it
possible
for
you
to
escape
.
<EOS>
I
make
another
attempt
to
free
myself
,
but
in
vain
;
and
think
my
own
time
have
now
come
,
I
resign
myself
to
my
fate
,
expect
every
moment
to
be
shoot
or
stab
in
the
back
.
<EOS>
but
much
to
my
surpise
however
,
instead
of
such
severe
measure
,
I
only
feel
my
captor
secure
my
hand
with
a
cord
,
and
hope
revive
that
they
be
not
perhaps
seek
my
life
.
<EOS>
why
they
use
no
other
violence
be
yet
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
a
horseman
dash
suddenly
into
the
bush
,
and
with
a
thrill
of
joy
I
recognise
in
the
rider
the
familiar
face
of
friend
Merton
.
<EOS>
at
sight
of
him
a
panic
seem
to
seize
upon
my
captor
,
who
instantly
let
go
their
hold
and
flee
.
<EOS>
determine
not
to
let
them
part
without
a
token
of
remembrance
,
I
unsling
my
rifle
,
which
they
have
leave
untouched
,
and
with
a
hasty
aim
fire
at
the
near
,
just
as
he
be
leave
my
sight
by
enter
some
thick
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
result
of
the
shot
I
know
not
;
but
he
appear
to
stumble
forward
,
and
utter
a
piercing
cry
as
of
pain
—
which
be
,
I
presume
,
the
sound
you
hear
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
time
to
grasp
Edward
by
the
hand
,
tell
him
of
your
suppose
fate
,
and
the
necessity
,
if
living
,
of
our
come
speedidy
to
your
assistance
,
when
,
to
my
astonishment
,
and
I
need
not
add
joy
,
I
see
you
both
issue
forth
,
and
await
your
approach
.
<EOS>
but
come
,
we
have
already
talk
too
long
in
a
time
when
decide
action
be
so
necessary
.
<EOS>
let
us
reload
as
speedily
as
possible
,
and
follow
up
our
so
far
good
fortune
.
""Right
!
"
say
Bernard
and
Tyrone
in
a
breath
;
and
all
four
instantly
commence
carry
out
Webber
's
suggestion
.
<EOS>
We
wish
the
reader
to
bear
in
mind
here
,
that
though
we
have
be
somewhat
long
in
describe
the
event
as
they
take
place
—
owe
to
our
relate
each
one
separately
—
the
whole
time
occupy
,
from
the
entrance
of
Curdish
,
Riley
and
Saxton
,
to
the
meeting
of
Webber
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
,
do
not
exceed
three
minute
.
<EOS>
but
a
short
time
elapse
ere
our
party
be
again
ready
for
action
;
and
nothing
daunt
by
what
have
take
place
,
on
a
second
suggestion
from
Webber
,
they
make
the
bridle
of
their
horse
fast
to
some
of
the
shrubbery
,
and
all
four
set
forward
to
the
old
hut
,
to
secure
the
ruffian
—
not
doubt
they
be
still
there
.
<EOS>
but
in
this
they
be
mistake
;
for
on
arrive
at
the
place
,
not
a
trace
of
either
,
with
the
exception
of
some
red
spot
of
blood
,
could
be
found,—curdish
and
Saxton
have
recover
in
their
absence
and
leave
,
bear
the
corpse
of
Riley
with
them
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
"
remark
Webber
,
as
he
glance
around
the
late
scene
of
strife
,
"
they
have
escape
us
I
perceive
;
and
perhaps
it
be
well
that
it
be
so
,
as
we
still
have
other
very
important
matter
on
our
hand
,
which
they
may
have
prevent
us
from
attend
to
in
season
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
what
do
you
allude
?
"
ask
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
forgotten
the
Jew
and
those
paper
<EOS>
—
that
be
if
he
have
any
in
his
possession?""ah
!
<EOS>
true
,
"
rejoin
<EOS>
tyrone:—"but
<EOS>
do
you
think
of
proceed
upon
that
business
at
once?""I
do
,
"
answer
Webber
,
"
as
soon
as
may
be
;
for
if
he
be
connect
with
these
fellow
,
as
I
doubt
not
he
be
,
he
will
be
likely
to
receive
from
them
information
of
what
have
happen
;
and
perhaps
,
expect
a
like
visit
from
us
,
will
decamp
—
at
least
for
the
time
be
;
and
by
the
way
too
,
the
more
so
,
as
these
fellow
doubtless
—
though
I
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
where
they
get
it
--
have
knowledge
of
our
present
design
;
for
you
see
they
have
their
plan
all
lay
to
attack
us
,
while
Hetty
herself
,
whom
we
come
to
seek
,
be
absent
.
<EOS>
""it
do
certainly
appear
singular
,
"
observe
Tyrone
,
thoughtfully
,
after
a
short
pause
;
"
but
still
I
do
not
see
how
they
could
have
be
inform
;
for
it
be
only
last
evening
<EOS>
we
talk
the
matter
over
,
and
it
have
be
communicate
to
no
one
since
.
<EOS>
"Webber
<EOS>
suddenly
start
,
as
though
some
disagreeable
thought
have
flash
through
his
mind
,
and
his
cheek
grow
pale
and
red
,
and
he
hang
his
head
thoughtfully
for
some
time
,
but
make
no
answer
.
<EOS>
perhaps
a
vague
suspicion
of
his
son
John
—
whose
disposition
he
know
too
well
—
trouble
him
.
<EOS>
but
whatever
it
be
,
as
we
have
say
,
he
return
no
answer
Bernard
be
the
next
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"I've
be
a
thinking
it
all
over
,
Mark
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
I
rather
guess
I
can
'
splain
it
away
without
make
any
witchery
on't
.
<EOS>
Ye
see
its
be
tarnal
hot
weather
lately
,
and
all
the
winder
have
be
hyste
about
our
house
,
so
that
if
any
feller
be
about
as
choose
to
listen
,
he
could
hear
all
that
be
say
easy
enough
.
<EOS>
now
this
ere
be
the
case
last
night
,
when
we
be
talk
it
all
over
,
and
like
as
not
one
of
these
ere
same
chap
come
along
,
and
play
the
spy
,
and
get
hold
of
all
twas
say
;

like
as
not
too
he
be
do
it
all
along
afore
,

to
know

how

a
go
on

<EOS>
""true
<EOS>
,
"
rejoin
tyrone
,
"
I
do
not
think
of
this
before
;
but
now
it
strike
me
very
forcibly
as
be
correct
.
<EOS>
what
be
your
opinion
on
the
subject
,
Webber?""It
may
be
so
,
"
answer
the
latter
;
"
I
hope
it
be
;
"
and
then
turn
abruptly
to
Merton
,
he
continued:—"By
the
way
,
<EOS>
Edward

you
be
the
very
person
I
wish
to

question

that
stranger
whom
you
meet
here
,
and
who
give
his
name
as
Barton
—
the
particular
of
which
I
get
from
Emily
.
<EOS>
"
at
the
mention
of
the
name
of
Emily
,
there
be
a
bright
glow
on
the
cheek
of
Edward
,
which
Webber
apparently
heed
not
as
he
continued:—"I
wish
you
to
describe
the
personal
appearance

this
Barton

"Merton

so

you
think

<EOS>
ask
Webber
,
as
the
other
conclude
his
description
.
<EOS>
"I
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it

answer
Merton

<EOS>
"Did
<EOS>
he
tell
you
his
occupation?""not
at
our
first
interview
,
but
he
have
since
do
so

<EOS>
""ah
!
<EOS>
then
you
have
see
him
again?""I
have

<EOS>
I
ride
in
company
with
him
awhile
this
morning
—
he
overtake
me
shortly
after
my
leave
St.
Louis
,
while
the
day
be
yet
grey
,
and
part
from
me
some
three
mile
back
,
to
go
and
look
at
some
land
,
which
he
state
he
have
lately
be
purchase
.
<EOS>
""He
be
then
a
land
speculator?""Such
<EOS>
he
tell
me
be
his
business

<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
the
same
then
,
"
say
Webber
.
<EOS>
"
but
what
do
he
know
of
the
Jew
,
and
how
do
he
explain
that
matter
of
the
ring?""O
,
simply
as
thus
,
"
answer
Merton
.
"
<EOS>
He
state
that
some
month
since
he
have
purchase
a
large
tract
of
land
,
at
a
very
low
price
,
from
the
fact
that
the
title
to
it
be
consider
very
doubtful
,
on
account
of
a
suppose
prior
claim
;
that
afterward
,
examine
the
land
,
he
have
find
it
of
great
value
,
by
reason
of
its
lead
mine
;
that
determining
,
if
possible
,
to
find
whether
there
be
a
prior
claim
—
and
,
if
so
,
to
purchase
it
,
ere
<EOS>
his
discovery
leak
out
—
he
have
advertise
the
same
in
the
paper
,
and
post
bill
in
different
section
of
the
country
—
the
result
of
which
have
be
his
receive
a
call
from
the
Jew
,
who
hold
the
paper
of
prior
right
,
and
who
offer
to
sell
,
but
on
high
terms:—that
on
ask
the
Jew
to
produce
his
document
,
he
have
do
so
;
but
to
his
utter
astonishment
have
find
that
the
deed
—
though
draw
up
in
proper
form
—
lack
the
signature
of
two
person
necessary
to
make
it
valid,—said
<EOS>
person
name
have
once
be
there
,
to
all
appearance
,
but
since
fade
out
,
owing
,
doubtless
,
to
their
have
be
write
with
a
villainous
ink
,
to
render
the
instrument
valueless:—that
at
this
discovery
<EOS>
the
rage
and
disappointment
of
the
Jew
have
be
great
:
and
he
have
declare
in
piteous
tone
that
he
be
a
ruin
man
—
have
exhaust
all
his
fund
in
the
purchase
of
this
now
worthless
paper
:
<EOS>
that
think
perhaps
the
Jew
have
be
dupe
,
and
take
pity
on
his
grey
hair
,
he
have
agree
to
pay
him
a
fair
price
for
his
paper
,
notwithstanding
,
but
on
condition
that
he
should
grant
him
any
favor
in
his
power

at
any

his

on
its
be
present
by
any
one
he
may
see
proper
to
deputise:—that
to
this
the
Jew
have
swear
most
solemnly
,
by
his
religion
,
and
by
everything
he
hold
sacred
—
and
that
the
first
trial
of
his
oath
have
be
make
by
myself
,
in
the
release
of
Emily

<EOS>
such
be
his
story

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
a
singular
one

"
add
Webber
,
in
reply
;
"
though
perhaps
a
true
one
.
""Wal
<EOS>
now
,
Bill
,
I
jest
do
not
believe
a
darn
word
on't

say
Bernard

"
if
all
the
story
about
that

tarnal
old

be
true

he
be
not
the
feller

would
mind
anything
about
an
oath

<EOS>
""Unless
<EOS>
for
his
interest
to
do
so
,

rejoin
Webber
.
<EOS>
"
You
overlook
,
Harvey
,
that
it
may
,
for
that
time
,
have
be
more
to
his
interest
to
let
the
girl
go
than
to
detain
her

doubtless
his
intention
be
,
and
still
be
,
to
recapture
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
cunning
knave
.
<EOS>
but
whether
true
or
false
,
it
be
the
good
and
only
explanation
we
have
of
the
matter
at
present
;
and
so
we
will
take
it
for
what
it
be
and
let
it
drop
—
for
time
wear
fast
,
and
we
should
even
now
be
on
the
road
;

say

he
turn

lead
the
way
from
the
cottage

<EOS>
"do
<EOS>
you
need
my
service
?
"
<EOS>
enquire
Merton
,
as
the
party
retrace
their
step
to
their
horse
.
"No
!
<EOS>
"
answer
Webber
:
"
I
trust
our
force
be
sufficient
;
and
as
I
presume
you
be
on
your
way
to
see
Emily

you
have
well
ride
on
;
and
doubtless
your
presence
will
cheer
her
,
for
she
seem
exceedingly
low
spirited

<EOS>
""Ah
!

"
<EOS>
ejaculate
Merton
,
with
a
flushed
countenance
;
"
I
will
see
her
then
,
and
quickly
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
this
time
they
have
reach
the
bush

where
the
animal

they
ride
out
into
the
path
and
separate
—
Merton
to
go
on
to
Webber
's
,
and
the
other
three
to
the
river
—
Webber
turn
in
his
saddle
,
and
said:"do
not
mention
this
little
skirmish
,
Edward
,
to
any
of
my
family

as
it
would
only
alarm
them
needlessly
;
"
and
spur
his
horse
as
he
speak
,
he
start
off
in
full
gallop
,
while
the
other
imitate
his
example
.
<EOS>
a
good
ride
of
two
hour
bring
the
party
of
Webber
to
the
river
,
and
a
few
minute
more
serve
to
discover
the
residence
of
the
Jew
;
for
although
neither
of
them
have
see
it
before
,
the
exact
location
have
be
clearly
point
out
.
<EOS>
dismount
at
a
little
distance
,
and
fasten
their
horse
,
they
together
proceed
to
the
old
hovel
.
<EOS>
as
they
near
the
entrance
,
they
be
somewhat
surprised
to
see
the
figure
of
a
man
—
a
little
distance
below
them
,
near
the
water
's
edge
—
his
face
turn
from
them
,
apparently
in
a
meditative
mood

<EOS>
at
sight
of
him
all
three
make
a
halt
,
and
Bernard
and
Tyrone
lay
their
hand
on
their
pistol
,
think
perhaps
it
be
another
of
the
gang
with
whom
they
have
be
contend

<EOS>
Webber
think
differently
,
however
,
and
bid
them
stand
where
they
be
,
he

at
the

time
the

—
as
though
examine
the
exact
location
of
the
bank
and
stream

by
which
mean
Webber
catch
a
side
view
of
his
feature

footstep
behind
him
,
Barton
start
,
draw
a
pistol
from
a
wampum
belt
around
his
waist
,
and
suddenly
confront
them
;
when
,
perceive
the
familiar
face
of
Webber
,
and
nothing
in
the
look
of
his
companion
of
a
hostile
nature
,
he
quickly
replace
the
weapon
,
and
,
step
forward
,
frankly
extend
his
hand
,
say
at
the

time
,
in
an
easy
,
cordial
tone:"I

you
good
morning
,
friend

that
;
merely
state
,
by
the
way
,
that
his
look
and
dress
be
now
almost
exactly
as
then
—
save
perhaps
a
more
bland
expression
of
countenance
,
and
a
change
from
his
then
strange
cap
to
one
of
silk
velvet
,
from
which
hang
a
silver
cord
tassel

after
the
usual
salutation

the
mention

perceptible
start
in

a
little
palor
in

I
be
relate
some
anecdote
of
him
last
evening

steadily
in

rusty

"Some
of
the
old
Jew

villainy

I
presume
,
"
reply
Webber
;
"
but
we
must
explore
it
,
at

I
see
a
ladder

then
,
"
he
add

"
we

better
stay
without

Will

about
half
of

when
there
issue
from

a
deep
,
sepulchral
groan
.
<EOS>
Webber
be
a
brave
man
,

so
be
his
companion
;

there
be
something
awful
in

both
turn
pale

a

"
what

torturing
pains?—for
love

pleasure

and
love
have
pains:—pleasures
the
most
deeply
thrilling
—
pain
of
the
deep
anguish
.
<EOS>
what
a
powerful
thing
be
love
!
<EOS>
how
it
stir
up
all
the
secret
spring
of
our
being
—
rouse
into
action
energy
and
passion
that
we
know
not
be
in
us
—
neutralize
,
at
the
same
time
,
and
sometimes
almost
completely
destroy
,
other
that
we
deem
be
all
powerful
.
<EOS>
all
potent
love
!
<EOS>
Monarch
of
the
mental
realm
;
to
which
all
—
high

rich
or
poor,—are
force
to
bow

<EOS>

it

through
the
universe
,
and
be

in
the
soft
air
of
Italy
—
in
the
frozen
region
of
Lapland
.
<EOS>
It
stalk
through
the
palace
of
the
mighty
one
of
earth
—
it
linger
in
the
hovel
of
the
peasant
and
the
outcast
.
<EOS>
It
soften
the
heart
of
emperor
and
king
,
and
bend
them
to
its
will
—
it
elevate
,
tranquilize
,
and
make
contentment
often
in
the
soul
of
the
lowly
bear

<EOS>
It
abound
in

,
as
in
civilized
life
;
and
the
untutored
outpouring
of
the
artless
Indian
of
the
forest
be
as
sweet
to
the
ear
of
the
savage
maiden
,
as
the
most
refined
and
flowery
phrase
of
the
courtly
lover
to
her
who
be
polish
by
the
art
of
civilization

<EOS>
all
conquer
love

<EOS>
who
can
withstand
it

<EOS>
It
warm
into
new
life
the
heart
of
the

it
destroy
the

of
the
great

and
as

he
sigh
to
own
that
love
be
his

and
thus
prove
himself
a
frail
piece
of
mortality
.
<EOS>
all
pervade
love
!
<EOS>
who
have
not
feel
its
presence?o
,
it
be
sweet
to
love
—
to
gaze
upon
some
gentle
or
noble
being
,
and
feel
all
the
deep
emotion
,
all
the
secret
sympathy
of
our
nature
center
there
,
as
it
be
a
nucleus
to
our
own
vitality
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
and
then
to
feel
that
that
love
be
return
;
to
know
,
to
realize
there
be
a
spontaneous
unity
,
a
sympathetic
yearning
of
soul
for
soul
;
that
there
be
in
this
cold
and
selfish
world
at
least
one
heart
in
which
we
may
place
confidence
—
one
be
on
whom
we
can
rely
,
to
stand
by
us
,
let
good
or
ill
betide
—
one
kindred
soul
that
will
ever
smile
when
we
rejoice
,
weep
when
we
do
mourn
--
o
,
this
,
this
be
sweet
—
ay
,
sweet
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
who
hath
not
at
some
time
of
his
or
her
life
feel
this
?
<EOS>
and
who
that
hath
feel
,
hath
not
sigh
a
rejoicing
sigh
that
there
be
such
a
thing
as
love?But
love
without
hope
—
love
without
a
reciprocity
of
feeling
—
to
love
one
that
you
know
can
never
be
yours
;
one
that
you
know
love
another
;
as
Shakspeare
says:"ay
,
there
be
the
rub
.
<EOS>
"oh
<EOS>
,
love
without
hope
be
terrible
—
terrible
!
<EOS>
to
feel
your
whole
life
and
soul
centre
in
a
being
—
a
being
every
way
worthy
,
but
one
who
be
in
turn
fix
upon
another
,
and
see
you
not
,
know
you
not
,
save
as
a
friend
—
a
friend
in
the
cold
,
worldly
meaning
of
the
term
,
and
perhaps
not
even
that
,
or
,
what
be
bad
,
love
you
as
a
sister
or
a
brother
,
and
,
dream
not
of
a
warm
feeling
in
your
own
breast
,
make
you
perchance
a
repository
of
confidence
,
and
paint
in
glow
color
your
rival
to
your
face
—
<EOS>
oh
,
how
this
can
wring
the
heart!—how
make
it
heave
,
and
palpitate
,
and
burn
,
and
ache
;
and
the
brain
too
,
grow
hot
,
and
seeth
,
and
wither
,
and
strain
,
and
reel
with
this
one
mighty
,
terrible
truth
—
sap
at
length
all
the
foundation
of
an
otherwise
noble
intellect
—
destroy
the
system
,
and
end
in
the
cold
and
silent
grave
!
<EOS>
but
few
,
comparatively
speak
,
feel
this
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
but
oh
,
to
those
few
,
how
terrible
the
feeling
!
<EOS>
We
may
talk
of
the
rack
,
and
the
dumnable
invention
of
torture
for
the
physical
man
;
but
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
be
they
when
compare
with
the
rack
that
rend
the
soul?but
,
say
the
reader
,
on
with
the
story
!
<EOS>
ay
,
and
on
with
the
story
say
we
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
beautiful
morning
--
the
same
with
which
we
open
the
chapter
preceede
—
and
the
sun
,
as
he
rise
in
a
reddened
halo
,
and
peer
gently
over
the
eastern
hill
,
pour
his
soft
mild
ray
through
the
doorway
and
open
casement
of
Webber
's
cottage
,
trace
out
bright
spot
upon
the
curtain
and
floor
,
and
seem
strive
to
give
every
thing
around
,
animate
and
inanimate
,
a
look
of
gladness
to
welcome
his
approach
.
<EOS>
all
nature
without
wear
a
cheerful
smile
;
and
every
little
zephyr
that
pass
go
loaded
with
perfume
and
song
;
but
with
these
bright
thing
our
task
be
not
;
ah
,
no
!
our
to
peer
into
the
depth
of
that
strange
thing
,
the
human
heart
,
to
decipher
the
character
on
its
tablet
,
and
thus
trace
the
cause
of
outward
effect
.
<EOS>
let
us
now
enter
the
apartment
of
the
invalid
,
some
half
hour
after
the
departure
of
Webber
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
.
<EOS>
but
two
person
be
there
—
Emily
and
Rufus
--
<EOS>
Mrs

Webber
be
employ
with
the
morning
labor
of
the
house
-
wife
in
the
other
apartment
.
<EOS>
emily
be
seat
by
a
table
—
a
few
foot
from
the
bed
on
which
recline
Rufus
—
with
one
soft
pearly
hand
rest
upon
it
,
and
her
now
pale
,
sad
,
but
still
sweet
face
incline
downward
,
and
her
deep
blue
eye
gaze
upon
the
floor
,
with
that
peculiar
expression
which
tell
the
mind
be
absent
.
<EOS>
sad
though
she
be
,
and
with
that
touching
sadness
which
go
at
once
to
the
heart
,
yet
one
in
gaze
upon
her
could
scarcely
wish
her
otherwise
,
she
look
so
exceedingly
lovely
.
<EOS>
She
be
dress
plain
,
but
neat
;
while
her
bright
auburn
hair
be
arrange
with
that
negligent
grace
which
give
even
to
beauty
another
charm
;
and
as
the
ray
of
the
sun
,
occasionally
,
from
the
swaying
of
the
curtain
,
stream
in
upon
it
,
and
deepen
its
golden
hue
,
one
could
easily
fancy
her
the
head
of
an
angel
encircle
by
a
golden
halo
.
<EOS>
on
the
bed
,
with
his
head
slightly
raise
and
support
by
his
hand
—
with
his
pale
,
wan
,
but
still
handsome
feature
turn
towards
Emily
,
and
his
full
blue
eye
fasten
tenderly
but
sadly
upon
her
—
lie
the
gentle
Rufus
,
a
prey
to
a
disease
—
a
disease
of
the
mind
—
that
be
destine
ere
long
to
bear
him
to
that
silent
<EOS>
home,"that
undiscovered
country
.
<EOS>
from
whose
bourne
no
traveler
return
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
what
be
that
disease
—
that
strange
disease
of
the
mind
—
that
be
wear
away
one
just
ripen
into
the
bloom
of
manhood
,
with
apparently
everything
before
him
to
make
life
happy
?
<EOS>
what
secret
trouble
in
one
so
young
could
be
drain
the
fountain
of
life
and
make
the
fertile
spot
a
desert
?
<EOS>
It
be
time
the
reader
should
know
,
if
he
or
she
(
as
we
doubt
not
)
have
not
already
divine
.
<EOS>
He
be
die
of
hopeless
love
!
<EOS>
ay
,
and
before
him
sit
the
being
in
whom
his
vitality
,
as
it
be
,
be
center
—
totally
unconscious
of
his
consume
passion
.
<EOS>
and
well
be
it
for
her
<EOS>
she
know
it
not
;
for
it
would
have
be
another
pang
—
ay
,
and
a
terrible
one
—
to
a
gentle
heart
already
too
full
of
anguish
!
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
return
his
passion
,
for
her
own
heart
be
set
upon
another
;
and
to
know
him
daily
waste
away
—
and
to
know
,
too
,
that
she
be
the
cause
—
would
have
be
a
grief
almost
insupportable
.
<EOS>
this
he
know
,
from
what
he
have
see
and
hear
,
and
have
resolve
to
carry
his
secret
with
him
to
the
grave
,
which
he
now
feel
be
not
far
distant
.
<EOS>
throw
together
in
childhood
,
from
a
child
up
Rufus
have
love
Emily
—
deeply
,
purely
love
her
—
and
his
be
a
soul
to
love
but
one
,
and
that
one
with
an
intensity
of
passion
more
powerful
than
life
itself
.
<EOS>
His
playmate
in
youth
,
he
have
dream
bright
dream
of
come
year
—
have
paint
beautiful
and
happy
picture
from
the
fancy
wrought
scene
of
the
shaded
future
;
dream
which
have
prove
but
dream
—
picture
in
which
there
be
no
reality
.
<EOS>
His
first
pang
have
be
on
their
first
separation
some
year
before
;
but
he
have
be
buoy
up
and
soothe
by
the
charmer
Hope
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
of
her
daily
,
almost
hourly
,
during
her
absence
—
have
long
for
,
and
yet
almost
dread
the
meeting
with
her
again
.
<EOS>
that
meeting
have
at
last
take
place
,
and
he
have
see
her
,
after
a
long
absence
,
bloom
in
all
the
grace
of
a
refined
,
noble
,
intellectual
woman
!
<EOS>
He
have
see
her
more
polished
and
beautiful
than
even
an
ardent
fancy
have
paint
her
,
and
with
his
own
mind
more
expand
and
mature
,
he
have
feel
his
passion
more
intense
;
which
,
like
the
pent
up
water
of
a
spring
,
he
know
must
find
vent
,
or
,
press
back
into
its
source
,
the
heart
,
undermine
,
and
finally
destroy
the
clayey
casement
around
it
.
<EOS>
but
alas
for
him
!
<EOS>
too
soon
he
discover
another
have
at
least
fix
her
attention
,
if
not
already
win
her
affection
,
and
a
strong
presentiment
have
tell
him
the
result
.
<EOS>
still
the
presentiment
have
not
prove
a
certainty
,
and
the
sweet
voice
of
the
charmer
Hope
have
occasionally
whisper
,
"
all
may
yet
be
well
.
<EOS>
"Thus
six
month
have
roll
away
,
with
him
<EOS>
al
most
wearily
;
for
although
near
the
gentle
being
of
his
secret
love
,
yet
he
daily
have
see
new
evidence
to
prove
him
farther
from
her
heart
than
ever
;
and
doubt
,
and
fear
,
with
occasionally
a
ray
of
hope
,
and
sleepless
night
,
and
day
of
anguish
,
have
already
do
their
work
on
a
constitution
never
at
any
time
the
strong
.
<EOS>
thus
,
we
say
,
six
month
have
roll
away
,
which
bring
us
to
the
opening
of
our
story
—
the
night
of
the
storm
,
and
of
Emily
's
capture
—
in
which
the
reader
will
remember
his
introduction
and
singular
conduct
.
<EOS>
and
yet
that
conduct
and
result
,
when
we
know
the
motive
power
—
the
state
of
his
constitution
,
and
temperament
—
appear
perfectly
simple
and
natural
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
,
we
may
add
,
with
every
thing
in
nature
—
everything
around
us
,
that
to
our
limited
vision
appear
mysterious
for
the
time,—no
sooner
do
we
learn
the
cause
,
than
we
admit
the
effect
could
not
have
be
otherwise
,
without
violate
some
law
of
nature
.
<EOS>
on
the
day
in
question
,
then
,
when
he
have
see
emily
ride
forth
with
Edward
,
a
presentiment
have
come
over
him
of
trouble
,
and
sorrow
to
come
;
and
his
step
have
be
slow
,
his
brow
cloud
,
and
his
heart
heavy
;
and
hence
the
cause
of
his
wild
manner
,
which
have
so
surprise
his
father
,
when
it
become
evident
some
accident
have
occur
to
prevent
their
return
.
<EOS>
have
pause
,
as
the
reader
will
remember
,
a
moment
on
the
hill
,
he
have
learn
from
Tyrone
the
whole
state
of
the
case
,
and
again
dash
on
with
a
wildness
border
on
insanity
.
<EOS>
instinctively
—
for
reason
could
scarcely
be
deem
paramount
with
him
then
—
he
have
shape
his
course
directly
for
the
Mississippi
;
but
ere
he
could
reach
it
,
his
quick
ear
have
catch
the
sound
of
her
sweet
voice
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
by
the
light
of
the
moon
<EOS>
,
he
have
descry
both
Edward
and
Emily
approach
.
<EOS>
be
completely
in
the
shade
,
they
have
not
observe
him
;
and
instantly
rein
his
horse
to
one
side
,
he
have
wait
in
a
thicket
for
them
to
pass
.
<EOS>
and
then
and
there
,
in
that
lonely
place
,
with
his
mind
tear
on
the
rack
of
terrible
excitement
,
he
have
hear
soft
word
from
her
own
sweet
lip
that
go
like
dagger
to
his
heart
,
and
extinguish
the
last
faint
gleam
of
hope
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
minute
after
that
magical
voice
have
die
away
in
the
distance
,
Rufus
have
sit
his
horse
more
like
a
statue
than
a
human
being
.
<EOS>
and
then
and
there
a
terrible
feeling
have
sweep
over
him
;
a
feeling
of
despair
and
death
—
a
consciousness
of
life
,
but
life
with
heated
iron
on
his
brain
,
and
poison
arrow
in
his
heart
—
while
reason
,
like
a
candle
consume
to
the
stick
,
be
flicker
in
the
socket
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
minute
he
have
sit
thus
;
and
then
,
with
reason
and
instinct
combine
,
have
come
a
desire
to
reach
home
.
<EOS>
mechauically
he
have
urge
his
high
-
spirited
beast
onward
,
and
take
a
circuitous
route
,
have
come
into
the
road
ahead
of
Edward
and
Emily
,
who
,
in
consequence
,
have
never
see
him
.
<EOS>
thus
he
reach
home
,
as
we
have
previously
show
,
long
in
advance
of
the
other
;
but
the
excitement
only
have
support
him
;
and
when
the
foam
steed
pause
at
the
door
,
and
he
have
announce
their
safety
,
his
nerve
relaxed
,
reason
for
the
time
flee
,
and
he
have
be
bear
into
the
house
in
a
high
state
of
fever
,
place
upon
a
bed
,
from
which
he
be
destine
never
to
rise
.
<EOS>
that
there
be
other
cause
,
besides
these
we
have
mention
,
combine
to
produce
his
sickness
,
we
do
not
deny
;
but
that
these
be
the
only
preventative
to
his
recovery
,
we
assert
.
<EOS>
have
thus
lay
bare
the
secret
of
his
heart
,
and
the
cause
of
what
may
otherwise
seem
mysterious
action
,
let
us
new
turn
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
minute
rufu
gaze
upon
Emily
Nevance
—
who
still
sit
as

skilful
one

in
this

as

prove

yes

I
feel
that

a

me
more

sad!""well

gently

"At
<EOS>
the
mention

Rufus
perceive
a
gentle
glow
suffuse
the

brightening
of

look

pleasure

plainly

the
fact

weight

gloomy
thought

interview

day

feel
glad

anything
that
would
for
the
time
relieve

;
and
seat
herself
by
the
side
of
Rufus

she
immediately
comply
with
his
request
;
and
begin
by
tell
him
her
first
sensation
when
she
arrive
in
the
great
metropolis

speak
of
the
manner
and
custom
of
the
citizen
—
of
the
different
grade
of
society
—
and
,
finally
,
touch
upon
Edward
—
their
first
interview
—
gradually
launch
out
upon
his
noble
appearance

manly
quality

generous
nature

she
do
so
,
her
very
soul
appear
to
run
in

voice

her
eye
sparkle
,
her
feature
become
animated

and
she
seem
for
the
time
completely
carry
away
by
a
noble
enthusiasm

<EOS>
alas
,
little
do
she
know
that
every
word
she
utter
go
like
point
steel
to
the
heart
of
Rufus
!
<EOS>
little
<EOS>
do
she
dream
that
her
narration
be
place
him
upon
a
rack
of
mental
torture
!
<EOS>
but
Rufus
know
before
the
state
of
her
feeling
;
and
he
have
ask
her
to
speak
of
the
past
,
and
of
Edward
,
merely
to
relieve
her
of
the
gloomy
thought
which
he
know
must
be
occupy
her
mind
,
to
cause
her
so
much
sadness

<EOS>
this
he
do
,
regardless
of
the
pain
it
occasion
himself
,
which
he
bear
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
or
sadden
gladness
—
if
the
reader
will
allow
us
an
expression
so
paradoxical

two

up
with

away

for

all
be
calm
again

turn
to
him
with
a
smile

friendly
greeting

<EOS>
nor
be
this
force
for
appearance
sake
as
one
may
suppose
;
for
in
his
heart
rufu
cherish
for
his
rival
the
most
friendly
feeling
—
believe
him
to
be
a
warm
hearted
,
noble
fellow
—
and
the
cause
of
his
anguish
,
when
Emily
speak
of
Edward
,
may
be
attribute
to
grief
at
his
own
hopeless
fate
,
rather
than
to
envy
or
jealousy
of
the
other

after

the
usual
salutation
of

day

country

"
You

I
think
a
little
healthy
exercise
in
the
open

will
prove
highly
beneficial

foreboding
of

""i
too
have
have
some
strange
foreboding
of
late
,
"
say
Emily
,
thoughtfully
;
"
though
I
scarcely
know
to
what
they
tend
.
<EOS>
""Ah
,
that
account
for
your
sadness
,
then
!
"
rejoin
Rufus
;
"
but
if
you
feel
any
hesitation
now
,
Emily
,
I
beg
of
you
not
to
go
—
for
I
can
not
shake
off
the
idea
,
that
if
you
do
,
we
part
for
the
last
time!""Oh
,
do
not
think
and
say
thus
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Emily
,
with
emotion
,
who
in
spite
of
herself
feel
a
feeling
of
awe
creep
over
her
.
"
<EOS>
do
not
say
thus
,
Rufus
!
<EOS>
You
have
long
year
before
you
yet

<EOS>
"Rufus
shake
his
head
with
a
wan
smile
.
—
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
,
"
he
say
,
"
what
I
know
,
or
you
would
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
what
I
have
tell
you
before
,
that
from
this
bed
I
shall
never
rise!""are
you
nearly
ready
?
"
<EOS>
enquire
the
voice
of
Merton
from
without
.
<EOS>
"I
must
go
,
dear
Rufus
,
for
I
have
promise
him
I
would
;
otherwise
I
would
not
;
"
say
Emily
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
not
go
far
,
Rufus
,
and
will
return
ere
sunset
;
this
I
promise
you
.
<EOS>
""well
,
"
return
Rufus
,
sadly
,
his
eye
fill
with
tear
,
"
God
enable
you
to
keep
your
promise
,
Emily
!
<EOS>
but
for
fear
of
the
bad
I
bid
you
farewell
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
press
her
hand
respectfully
to
his
lip
.
<EOS>
"
if
we
do
not
meet
again
on
earth

"
he
add
,
in
a
tremble
voice
,
"
I
trust
we
shall
in
Heaven
!
<EOS>
Farewell
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
unnerve
me
,
Rufus
,
"
say
Emily
,
burst
into
tear
.
<EOS>
"
surely
you
be
make
a
too
solemn
affair
of
this
—
or
be
you
in
reality
dying
,
Rufus
?
"
and
the
very
thought
seem
to
startle
her
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
feel
myself
to
be
die
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
term
,
"
answer
Rufus
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
live
week
,
even
month
to
come
;
and
I
may
scarcely
live
day
—
<EOS>
so
uncertain
do
I
look
upon
the
time
allot
me
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
then
,
Rufus
,
"
return
Emily
,
hastily
dry
her
tear
,
"
do
not
give
way
to
such
gloomy
thought
.
<EOS>
I
will
return
again
presently
;
but
I
see
Edward
be
get
impatient
,
and
I
must
not
keep
him
longer
wait
.
<EOS>
there
,
good
bye
!
"
and
bend
down
as
she
speak
<EOS>
,
she
press
a
kiss
upon
his
forehead
,
and
turn
quickly
away
.
"farewell
!
<EOS>
"
utter
he
again
,
in
a
low
,
tremble
voice
.
<EOS>
"
if
we
should
never
meet
again
,
Emily
,
remember
I
—
I
can
not
tell
you
,
"
he
say
,
as
she
pause
near
the
door—"so
farewell
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
sink
back
upon
his
pillow
,
and
turn
his
head
away
;
while
Emily
,
her
heart
beat
with
strange
emotion
,
quickly
join
Edward
.
<EOS>
as
emily
approach
,
Edward
could
not
but
perceive
that
she
have
be
weep
;
but
wisely
choose
to
make
no
comment
thereon
,
he
assist
her
to
mount
,
and
merely
say
,
"
to
the
north
,
Emily
,
"
he
lead
her
horse
forward
in
that
direction
a
short
distance
,
and
then
yield
the
guidance
wholly
to
her
,
walk
along
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
Their
departure
have
be
mark
with
an
eager
look
,
by
a
tall
figure
,
stand
a
little
distance
in
the
rear
of
the
cottage
—
on
whose
feature
,
as
they
pass
from
his
sight
,
play
a
strange
,
dark
smile
;
and
muttering
,
"
now
be
my
time
!
"
<EOS>
he
turn
quickly
round
,
and
abruptly
disappear
.
<EOS>
who
be
that
figure
?
<EOS>
and
what
be
the
meaning
of
those
singular
words?CHAPTER
ii.the
MEDITATION
—
the
interruption
—
the
conversation
—
the
arbor
of
LOVE
—
the
declaration
—
the
STORM
—
the
MYSTERIOUS
DISAPPEARANCE
—
<EOS>
the
SEARCH.For
some
time
Edward
and
Emily
pursue
their
way
slowly
and
in
silence
,
for
in
the
heart
of
both
be
deep
and
powerful
feeling
.
<EOS>
with
emily
herself
,
circumstance
have
combine
to
depress
her
spirit
with
a
gloominess
seldom
or
never
feel
before
;
for
each
thing
that
have
transpire
of
late
,
seem
to
rush
in
upon
her
now
,
as
if
to
overwhelm
and
crush
her
beneath
the
gathering
weight
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
thought
,
black
and
portentous
as
the
cloud
that
herald
a
terrible
storm
,
come
flit
like
evil
spirit
through
her
mind
—
<EOS>
each
bear
its
own
dark
and
cheerless
aspect
—
enliven
by
no
ray
of
hope
,
no
sunshine
of
gladness
.
<EOS>
even
the
temporary
relief
she
have
find
while
talk
with
Rufus
of
the
past
and
of
Edward
,
have
,
from
her
after
thought
,
and
the
contrast
,
serve
to
produce
only
a
painful
reaction
;
and
although
the
one
she
love
—
the
one
she
have
extoll
in
such
glowing
language
—
be
now
by
her
side
,
yet
that
very
fact
itself
,
instead
of
make
her
joyful
,
only
add
to
her
grief
.
<EOS>
and
wherefore
this?we
have
,
on
a
previous
occasion
,
attempt
to
give
the
reader
an
insight
into
the
character
of
Emily
,
which
,
if
fully
bear
in
mind
,
will
be
sufficient
to
show
why
she
be
thus
actuate
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
we
describe
her
as
very
sensitive
,
and
self
-
sacrifice
,
and
one
incapable
of
wound
the
feeling
of
another
,
when
it
be
possible
for
her
to
avoid
do
so
without
in
the
end
make
matter
still
bad
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
,
too
,
we
describe
her
feeling
in
regard
to
herself
,
and
her
doubtful
parentage
,
as
be
very
painful
;
and
also
her
attachment
for
Edward
—
which
,
on
this
account
,
she
deem
herself
compel
by
a
sense
of
duty
to
break
off
—
as
be
no
less
so
.
<EOS>
these
be
enough
to
have
make
her
sad
,
if
not
gloomy
,
even
now
;
for
she
know
the
result
of
her
decision
must
be
very
painful
both
to
Edward
and
herself
;
but
the
event
which
have
since
transpired
,
have
add
their
sombre
color
to
the
already
dark
picture
,
until
not
one
bright
spot
remain
.
<EOS>
the
strange
and
awful
appearance
of
John
—
as
he
stand
like
a
demon
before
her
,
overpower
by
rage
—
be
still
present
to
her
vision
;
and
his
dark
and
terrible
word
of
threaten
be
still
ring
in
her
ear
.
<EOS>
what
may
be
the
result
of
that
interview
—
to
what
act
of
villainy
on
his
part
it
may
tend
—
be
impossible
for
her
to
foresee
;
but
,
as
we
have
show
,
a
heavy
foreboding
of
come
ill
have
settle
on
her
spirit
—
a
forebode
she
have
find
impossible
to
shake
off
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
a
stranger
who
thus
accost
her
—
or
any
one
not
directly
in
the
family
with
whom
she
have
be
rear
,
and
to
whom
,
for
a
thousand
little
act
of
kindness
,
she
feel
herself
so
much
indebted
<EOS>
—
she
would
have
relate
at
once
the
whole
occurrence
,
that
proper
precaution
may
be
take
to
secure
her
against
violence
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
case
stand
,
in
the
present
instance
,
she
do
not
feel
herself
at
liberty
to
do
so
—
from
the
fact
that
,
know
the
strong
temperament
of
both
father
and
son
,
she
foresee
consequence
of
a
disagreeable
nature
must
naturally
ensue
,
and
that
she
,
however
indirectly
,
would
be
the
move
cause
of
a
rupture
,
and
perhaps
a
disunion
in
the
family
;
and
besides
,
too
,
she
vaguely
trust
the
whole
affair
would
terminate
in
simply
a
threat
;
that
John
may
have
utter
it
,
while
in
passion
,
merely
to
intimidate
her
;
and
that
when
he
should
come
to
himself
,
he
would
see
his
folly
and
let
it
pass
.
<EOS>
this
we
say
she
hope
;
but
in
truth
she
doubt
,
and
fear
,
and
it
trouble
her
much
notwithstanding
.
<EOS>
She
long
to
make
some
one
her
confidant
,
and
take
advice
regard
the
proper
course
for
her
to
pursue
;
but
she
know
of
none
in
whose
keep
the
secret
would
be
safe
—
no
,
not
even
with
Edward
himself
;
for
in
his
earnest
regard
for
her
welfare
,
she
know
he
would
feel
himself
justified
in
at
once
lay
the
matter
before
Webber
,
and
even
confront
John
himself
,
when
probably
a
quarrel
,
and
a
duel
,
perhaps
,
would
be
the
result
.
<EOS>
no
,
she
must
keep
it
lock
in
her
own
breast
,
and
bear
her
painful
thought
in
silence
.
<EOS>
all
these
thing
,
together
with
the
grief
she
feel
for
Rufus
,
and
the
recollection
of
their
solemn
parting
,
and
his
seeming
prophetic
word
,
be
sufficient
,
as
we
have
say
,
to
cloud
Emily
's
naturally
bright
spirit
with
a
gloom
she
have
never
know
before
;
and
ponder
these
all
over
in
her
mind
,
as
she
ride
along
,
she
allow
her
head
to
droop
,
and
gaze
upon
the
ground
with
an
abstract
air
.
<EOS>
Edward
,
as
he
walk
along
by
her
side
,
be
also
busy
with
thought
of
his
own
;
and
his
eye
,
too
,
be
bent
on
the
ground
,
while
the
expression
of
his
feature
,
if
not
sad
,
be
at
least
solemn
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
there
to
cause
this
?
<EOS>
We
answer
,
many
thing
.
<EOS>
as
the
reader
be
aware
,
Edward
's
first
interview
with
Emily
have
be
while
a
student
in
the
city
of
New
York
;
and
from
that
moment
he
have
feel
that
his
future
happiness
or
misery
rest
with
her
;
and
,
in
consequence
,
he
have
studiously
seek
to
win
her
affection
.
<EOS>
in
this
,
as
the
reader
be
also
aware
,
he
have
succeed
;
and
twice
he
have
offer
her
his
hand
;
but
although
not
exactly
refuse
,
he
have
be
put
off
with
the
plea
that
both
be
yet
too
young
,
and
that
she
could
not
think
of
wed
him
until
he
have
ask
and
obtain
the
consent
of
his
parent
.
<EOS>
this
with
him
have
be
a
severe
drawback
;
for
although
he
feel
he
may
succeed
in
gain
the
consent
of
his
mother
,
yet
he
know
his
father
—
who
be
a
wealthy
merchant
in
St.
Louis
,
and
whose
soul
be
center
on
gold
—
have
,
for
year
,
in
his
own
mind
,
destine
him
to
marry
,
so
soon
as
both
party
be
of
the
proper
age
,
a
distant
relation
—
an
heiress
of
great
wealth
.
<EOS>
that
in
this
alliance
,
money
be
all
his
father
seek
or
care
for
,
he
believe
;
and
the
very
thought
that
he
should
thus
give
his
hand
for
gold
,
be
,
to
one
of
his
proud
,
noble
spirit
,
repugnant
in
the
extreme
;
and
he
have
fully
determine
in
his
own
mind
such
an
event
should
never
take
place
;
and
to
such
an
extreme
will
prejudice
of
this
kind
sometimes
carry
a
person
of
his
temperament
,
that
it
be
a
questionable
point
whether
,
have
emily
herself
be
the
heiress
,
and
he
know
it
previously
,
he
have
not
on
this
account
refuse
even
her
.
<EOS>
convinced
,
at
length
,
that
though
Emily
ardently
love
him
,
she
on
this
one
point
would
remain
firm
in
her
first
decision
,
he
have
resolve
—
after
his
interview
with
her
on
the
night
of
the
opening
of
our
story
—
to
lay
the
whole
affair
before
his
father
,
tell
him
exactly
how
matter
be
in
every
particular
,
the
hopelessness
of
his
expect
him
to
form
another
attachment
,
and
thus
endeavor
to
win
his
consent
.
<EOS>
this
he
have
do
,
or
rather
have
attempt
to
do
;
for
scarcely
have
he
broach
the
subject
,
so
that
his
father
understand
the
drift
of
it
,
ere
the
latter
,
in
a
terrible
passion
,
bade
him
begone
,
and
never
speak
to
him
of
the
like
again
—
tell
him
he
should
never
marry
one
poor
than
himself
with
his
consent
,
and
that
should
he
dare
to
marry
without
his
consent
,
he
would
both
disown
and
disinherit
him
.
<EOS>
although
Edward
have
be
in
part
prepare
for
this
,
from
know
his
father
's
worldly
motive
and
hasty
temper
,
yet
the
result
have
be
to
cause
him
great
pain
and
despondency
.
<EOS>
but
though
he
may
despond
,
Edward
be
not
one
to
despair
,
while
there
be
even
the
faint
gleam
of
hope
remain
;
and
he
have
determine
,
as
a
last
resource
,
to
see
Emily
,
tell
her
all
,
offer
her
his
hand
once
more
,
and
abide
her
decision
.
<EOS>
—
with
this
intent
he
have
call
upon
her
once
since
that
night
;
but
owe
to
the
severe
illness
of
Rufus
,
no
opportunity
have
present
itself
for
conversation
on
the
subject
,
and
he
have
resolve
upon
to
-
day
for
his
next
meeting
—
which
meeting
,
as
the
reader
know
,
have
already
take
place
.
<EOS>
not
be
sufficiently
in
private
in
the
cottage
for
his
purpose
Edward
,
on
this
account
,
partly
,
and
partly
on
account
of
her
gloomy
appearance
,
have
be
strenuous
in
urge
Emily
to
ride
forth
.
<EOS>
occupy
in
think
on
this
subject
,
and
how
good
to
introduce
it
,
for
a
goodly
distance
keep
Edward
silent
,
while
Emily
,
as
we
have
show
,
be
,
from
various
cause
,
silent
also
.
<EOS>
the
long
soliloquy
or
meditation
must
come
to
an
end
;
and
both
Edward
and
Emily
find
themselves
suddenly
arouse
from
their
reverie
by
a
rather
ludicrous
circumstance
.
<EOS>
so
intently
have
their
mind
be
fix
upon
the
matter
just
record
,
that
no
attention
whatever
have
be
pay
by
either
to
the
course
of
the
beast
;
which
have
be
leave
entirely
free
,
think
,
doubtless
,
he
have
a
perfect
right
to
choose
for
himself
,
and
accordingly
have
quit
the
path
they
suppose
themselves
pursue
,
and
be
,
at
this
moment
,
quietly
endeavor
to
force
his
way
through
some
dense
shrubbery
—
the
limb
of
which
come
in
rather
severe
contact
with
his
more
reasoning
companion
,
and
some
what
startle
them
.
<EOS>
what
a
strange
,
vacillate
creature
be
a
human
being
!
<EOS>
how
changeable
,
and
what
an
embody
medley
of
inconsistency
!

that

paint
dark

ones?""ay
,

in

all

answer
Merton
;
"
for
how
often
be
we
prone
to
imagine
dire
event
that
never
happen
,
and
in
that
imagination
undergo
more
real
misery
than
we
would
even
in
the
reality
itself
.
<EOS>
and
even
when
we
be
actually
suffer
,
if
we
look
closely
into
ourselves

we
shall
find
,
as
a
general
thing
,
that
that
very
suffer
rest
almost
entirely
in
the
manner
we
look
upon
it

<EOS>
take
as
a
proof
of
this
,
the
terrible
fate
of
the
ancient
martyr
—
who
,
when
hoot

revile
at
by
a
barbarous
crowd

drag
in
chain
to
the
stake

alive

psalms

inhuman
monster

them

do
they
not

the
pain
of
corporeal
punishment

<EOS>
They
be
flesh

blood
like
ourselves

just
as
sensitive
to
the
touch

still
they
believe
they
be
die
in
a
holy
cause

hope
teach
them
to
look
beyond
the
present
,
and
,
aid
by
their
imagination

they
already
stand
on
the
very
threshold
of
Heaven

feel
happy

<EOS>
let
us
then
,
Emily
,
if
the
present
seem
dark
,
take
a
lesson
from
those
martyr

look
forward

bright
hope

thus
meet
our
trouble

"Two
year
since
,
Emily
,
as
you
be
aware
,
we
meet
for
the
first
time
,
in
the
city
of
New
York
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
needless
to
repeat
what
I
long
ere
this
have
tell
you
,
and
more
than
once
,
that
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
know
what
it
be
to
love
.
<EOS>
to
praise
each
particular
grace
or
charm
that
captivate
me
,
would
be
too
much
like
the
idle
flattery
of
the
world
;
suffice
,
that
I
see
enough
in
you
to
win
my
affection
,
and
I
love
you
—
<EOS>
love
you
purely
—
as
I
never
more
can
love
another
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
too
,
and
not
without
cause
,
that
my
passion
be
return
;
and
wait
a
suitable
time
and
opportunity
,
I
declare
my
feeling
,
and
offer
you
my
hand
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
refuse
me
,
or
I
should
certainly
never
have
trouble
you
again
;
but
you
ask
if
my
parent
be
aware
of
this
;
and
on
my
replying
in
the
negative
,
say
that
perchance
they
would
refuse
their
consent
,
because
you
be
poor
;
that
we
be
both
too
young
to
fully
know
our
own
mind
;
that
in
an
undertaking
like
this
,
the
journeying
through
life
as
companion
,
we
should
be
well
assure
that
nothing
hereafter
would
cause
us
to
regret
have
choose
hastily
;
that
time
would
be
the
proper
test
to
prove
whether
in
sincerity
we
both
love
,
or
whether
it
be
merely
a
fancy
.
<EOS>
this
be
your
reply
;
and
although
I
be
then
fully
satisfied
that
for
one
I
should
never
so
love
another
,
yet
I
feel
the
force
of
your
answer
,
and
acquiesce
.
<EOS>
that
,
Emily
,
be
fifteen
month
ago
;
and
though
with
you
after
that
,
almost
daily
,
until
my
return
to
the
West
,
wherein
you
accompany
me
—
and
very
often
in
your
society
since
—
yet
never
do
I
directly
speak
on
this
subject
again
,
till
the
evening
of
your
capture
,
when
I
again
ask
you
to
be
mine
—
again
offer
you
my
hand
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
refuse
me
then
—
no
,
you
even
tell
me
you
love
me
;
which
,
although
I
fully
believe
before
,
yet
hear
from
your
own
sweet
lip
,
make
my
heart
bind
with
rapture
;
but
at
the
same
time
you
state
you
be
poor
,
and
consequently
be
not
my
equal
in
this
;
and
that
you
could
not
consent
,
unless
assure
of
the
consent
of
my
parent
.
<EOS>
"'tis
<EOS>
true
,
Emily
,
that
in
many
thing
we
should
consult
and
take
the
advice
of
those
who
have
rear
us
from
infancy
—
but
it
do
not
follow
we
should
in
all
,
particularly
in
matter
of
the
heart
;
and
when
,
too
,
a
person
like
myself
have
arrive
at
the
age
of
discretion
,
and
know
what
be
the
most
conducive
to
his
own
happiness
.
<EOS>
"think
<EOS>
,
dear
emily
,
think
even
for
a
moment
seriously
upon
it
,
and
your
kind
heart
will
tell
you
it
be
wrong
—
very
,
very
wrong
—
for
those
who
have
pass
,
or
be
pass
,
into
the
decline
of
life
,
and
have
lose
in
part
,
or
by
a
rude
contact
with
a
selfish
world
benumb
,
those
fine
and
holy
feeling
of
love
,
which
entwine
around
the
heart
of
youth
,
soften
and
make
it
green
,
even
as
the
ivy
around
the
oak
add
beauty
and
gentleness
to
its
appearance
;
wrong
,
I
say
,
for
those
to
dictate
to
the
young
—
who
be
full
of
the
joy
and
poetry
of
the
morning
of
life
—
where
they
shall
give
their
hand
;
and
this
,
too
,
when
mercenary
consideration
be
their
rule
motive
for
so
do
;
and
by
this
make
them
unhappy
,
and
destroy
all
the
sweet
of
existence
—
force
them
to
sigh
for
the
final
rest
of
the
cold
and
silent
grave
.
<EOS>
think
upon
it
,
Emily
,
and
how
inconsistent
do
it
appear
.
<EOS>
what
have
money
to
do
with
the
heart
?
<EOS>
Can
it
ease
one
pang
?
<EOS>
Can
it
still
one
pulsation
?
<EOS>
Can
it
make
us
forget
to
think
upon
the
past
—
upon
those
we
have
love
?
<EOS>
Can
it
make
us
escape
ourselves
?
<EOS>
Can
it
procure
us
a
high
seat
in
Heaven
?
<EOS>
Can
it
add
to
our
devotion
to
an
all
-
see
God
?
<EOS>
Can
it
purchase
one
really
happy
moment
?
<EOS>
no
,
dear
emily
,
it
can
do
none
of
these
.
<EOS>
then
wherefore
<EOS>
should
we
make
ourselves
miserable
—
<EOS>
wherefore
throw
away
the
happiness
already
in
our
grasp
,
for
its
weight
of
misery
,
even
though
a
mine
of
gold
be
put
in
the
balance
?
<EOS>
and
then
,
too
,
how
inconsistent
that
we
should
be
force
into
these
measure
by
those
who
should
seek
our
happiness
?
—
who
,
as
I

rapidly
approach
old
age

dissolution
,
and
whom
we
have
a
right
to
suppose
,
by
the
regular
order
of
event

will
long
precede
us
to
the

inconsistent
that
we
should
be
make
wretched
to
please
them
,
who
will
soon
leave
us
alone
,
to
drink
deep
of
sorrow
,
and
entail
it
upon
our
posterity
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
dear
Emily
,
this
should
not
be
!
<EOS>
parent
may
advise
in
such
matter
,
but
they
have
no
right
,
by
the
law
of
either
God
or
man
,
to
usurp
authority
,
and
become
dictator
and
tyrant
!
<EOS>
so
soon
as
they
do
this
,
they
overstep
their
proper
limit
,
and
sever
the
tie
of
consanguinity
.

"edward

gently
,
in
a
calm
,
earnest

musical
tone

his
head
turn
towards

his
dark
hazel
eye
rest
tenderly
upon
her

,
as
he
go
on
,
become
deeply
interested

gradually
raise
her
head
,
and
now
sit
with
her
soft
blue
eye
look
with
a
mournful
sweetness
into
his
,
with
that
peculiar
expression
which
can
never
be

for
other
than
one
of
love

these

with

and
with
a

slightly

perhaps
a
little
more
passionate

still
go
on

"Such
,
dear
Emily
,
as
I
have
point
out
as
most
reprehensible
in

,
I
grieve
to

,
the
rule
motive
of
mine

<EOS>
I
would
not

aught
to
wrong
those
who
give
me
birth
—
who
watch
over
me
in
infancy

and
rear
me
in
affluence

no
,
far
be
it
from
me
to
do
this

or
willingly
wound
their
feeling

yet
as
much
as
I
may
love

I
must
respect
myself

nor
allow
myself
to
be

very
wealthy

much
good

make
many
a

around

as
well

<EOS>
but
alas
and
alas
,
dear

he
have
make
money
his
God

at

shrine
he
sacrifice
all
those
high

noble

in

that

You

I
part
with

on

eventful
night

I
do
so
with
the
determination

tell
my
father
all

gain

if
possible

his

to

I
seize
upon

over

He
hear
me
but
a
few
moment
,
and
then
in
rage
spurn
me
from
his
presence
,
and
say
that
do
I
marry
without
his
consent
,
he
would
both
disown
and
disinherit
me
,
and
that
his
consent
should
never

give
to
my
union
with
one
poor
than
himself

<EOS>
I
forget
not
he
be
my

quit
his

without

never

in
a
voice
that
tremble
from
a
sudden
fear
she
could
not
account
for
,
while
her
cheek
grow
pale
from
the

cause

<EOS>
the
latter
predict

the

for
from
the
gallop
in

set
off

he
shortly
slacken
to
a
trot

finally
pause
altogether
,

amuse
himself
by
crop
some
herbage

come
up

leave
Emily

,
strange
to

,
she
be
nowhere
to

<EOS>
at
first
astonishment
sieze
upon
Merton
that
she
should
absent
herself
at
such
a
critical
time
;
but
astonishment
soon
give
way
to
alarm
—
alarm
to
horror
—
<EOS>
when
on
call
her
name
loudly
several
time
no
answer
be
return
but
the
gloomy
echo
of
his
own
voice

<EOS>
what
could
it
mean
—
where
have
she
go
,
and
what
terrible
fate
have
befall
her
,
that
she
do
not
return
?
<EOS>
be
question
which
he
ask
himself
with
a
wildness
bordering
upon
insanity
,
while
he
ride
up
and
down
and
through
the
grove
,
still
call
at
the
extent
of
his
voice
her
dearly
love
name

Could
she
have
be
seize
by
some
wild
beast

Edward
think
,
and
shudder
,

feel
his
brain
reel

He
spring
from
his
horse

examine
the
ground
around
where
she
have
stand
—
<EOS>
but
no
,
there
be
no
mark
of
blood
or
violence
;
besides
,
have
this
be
the
case
,
he
would
have
hear
her
scream

<EOS>
what
could
it
mean

spring
upon

again

force
into
the
belief
that

away
by

you

"
<EOS>
in
a
few
hurried
word
Merton
explain
what
have
chance
,
while
Bernard
,
Tyrone
and
Mrs.
Webber
,
hear
the
exclamation
,
reach
the
door
in
time
to
learn
all
.
<EOS>
"Mount
<EOS>
—
mount
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Webber
,
spring
upon
one
of
the
horse
,
while
Bernard
and
Tyrone
quickly
follow
his
example
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mount
and
away
,
for
we
must
find
her
!
"
<EOS>
a
minute
later
,
all
four
be
ride
as
if
for
life
—
Merton
in
advance

<EOS>
a
groan
draw
Mrs.
Webber
's
attention
to
her
son
.
<EOS>
on
enter
the
room
she
find
Rufus
have
faint
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
enough
to
know
that
Emily
be
lose
,
and
that
,
as
he
have
predict
,
they
would
never
meet
again
on
earth
.
<EOS>
the
search
of
the
party
prove
fruitless
,
and
towards
morning
they
return
.
<EOS>
It
be
renew
the
next
day
,
and
the
next
,
and
the
next
;
and
yet
on
the
third
night
they
have
find
no
trace
—
glean
no
tiding
of
Emily
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
severe
blow
to
all
—
to
Webber
and
Merton
in
particular
.
<EOS>
leave
them
to
their
search
,
however
,
in
ignorance
of
her
fate
,
we
will
turn
to
the
cause
of
our
fair
heroine
's
sudden
and
mysterious
disappearance
,
and
the
wherefore
she
do
not

have
Edward
depart
,
and
while
Emily
stand
gaze
on
his
retreat
form
,
with
a
secret
fear
,
the
cause
of
which
she
be
unable
to
divine
,
when
two
figure
,
their
face
conceal
by
mask
,
approach
her
stealthily
from
behind
,
throw
a
bandage
over
her
mouth
to
prevent
her
cry
for
help
,
raise
her
in
their
brawny
arm
,
and
,
without
a
word
,
bore
her
speedily
away
—
<EOS>
directly
past
the
fall
tree
,
where
she
have
but
a
few
minute
before
in
a
happy
confidence
plight
herself
to
him
she
love
—
across
the
silvery
stream
that
have
the
while
sing
its
seeming
song
of
love
—
up
into
the
dark
wood
of
the
hill
beyond
.
<EOS>
here
for
a
moment
they
pause
to
rest
,
and
then
,
without
speak
,
again
bear
her
onward
some
three
hundred
yard
,
still
deep
into
the
wood
,
and
farther
from
him
who
should
have
be
there
to
protect
her
.
<EOS>
when
they
pause
again
,
it
be
beside
two
powerful
horse
,
on
one
of
which
she
be
instantly
mount
in
front
of
one
of
her
captor
,
while
his
companion
,
spring
into
the
sad
dle
,
lead
the
way
,
as
fast
as
the
ground
would
permit
,
in
a
westerly
direction
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
Emily
hear
in
the
distance
the
voice
of
Edward
call
upon
her
name
,
and
a
keen
pang
shoot
through
her
soul
.
<EOS>
Her
captor
hear
it
also
,
but
with
very
different
feeling
;
for
the
one
in
advance
,
turn
to
his
companion
,
said:"We
's
jest
in

<EOS>
Saxton
,
for
if
we
would
a
be
a
little
sooner
or
a
little
later
,
we
would
a
have
to
put
a
veto
on
the
tune
of
that
ar

<EOS>

you
know
that
be
strictly

<EOS>
""Right

in
the
morning

afore

would
get

<EOS>
that

I

for
if

""And

other
reply
only
by
utter
a
terrible
oath
,
and
set
his
tooth
hard
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
"
resume
Niles
,
"
it
be
an
ugly
business
,
take
it
all
round
,
and
we
get
the
bad
on'tbill

—
<EOS>
Jack
have
his
face
badly
batter
,
and
another
ball
through
his
arm
,
which
may
be
will
do
him
too
—
you
get
a
sore
head
,
and
I
lose
two
finger
;
while
Besley
,
whose
leg
be
a
leetle
the
long
,
get
off
clear
.
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
Sax
.
,
jest
tie
a
handkerchief
over
that
ar
'
gal
's
eye
,
<EOS>
so
she
can
not
examine
direction
<EOS>
,
you
know
that
be
order
,
and
then
let
's
ride
—
for
ye
see
its
gittin
'
dark
in
these
ere
wood
,
and
a
big
shower
to
back
it
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
a
moment
Emily
find
her
eye
bandage
,
and
then
she
could
feel
the
horse
urge
on
to
great
speed
,
while
peal
on
peal
,
each
near
than
the
last
,
come
to
her
ear
the
thunder
of
the
approach
storm
.
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
she
feel
it
be
useless
to
struggle
against
her
destiny
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
and
commend
herself
to
the
care
of
Him
who
watch
alike
over
the
powerful
and
defenceless
,
she
resign
herself
to
her
fate
.
<EOS>
Her
captor
have
again
become
silent
,
and
on
,
on
they
ride
for
some
half
hour
,
as
fast
as
the
beast
could
carry
them
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
time
mention
,
they
come
to
a
halt
by
some
dwelling
,
and
Emily
could
hear
the
low
murmur
of
several
other
voice
in
hurried
conversation
.
<EOS>
at
length
one
more
loud
,
and
in
dictation
,
strike
her
ear
with
a
familiar
sound
,
and
fairly
make
her
blood
run
cold
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
voice
of
John
Webber
.
<EOS>
"You
will
stop
here
and
refresh
until
this
storm
have
pass
,
which
it
will
have
do
in
less
than
two
hour
,
and
then
you
must
mount
and
on
again
till
you
reach
the
point
designate
,
for
this
side
of
there
<EOS>
it
will
not
do
to
remain
.
<EOS>
I
must
return
this
night
,
or
I
may
be
suspect
.
<EOS>
Jack
be
too
badly
wound
to
be
your
company
.
<EOS>
between
ourselves
,
I
fear
his
day
be
over
.
<EOS>
Hetty
will
go
with
you
,
and
in
her
charge
you
can
trust
her
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
route
,
so
that
you
can
follow
it
in
the
night
,
do
you
not?""We
do
,
"
answer
the
voice
of
Niles
.
<EOS>
"'tis
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
thus
far
your
part
have
be
admirably
perform

<EOS>
complete
as
well

and
you
shall
have
a
suitable
reward

<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
your
service
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
come
,
come
,
dismount
and
enter
,
for
already
the
rain
I
see
approach
.
<EOS>
feed
well
your
horse
.
<EOS>
I
must
this
moment
away
.
<EOS>
"
as
the
voice
conclude
,
Emily
hear
the
tramping
of
another
horse
,
fast
grow
distant
,
and
feel
herself
seize
and
borne
under
some
shelter
,
on
which
,
a
few
moment
after
,
the
rain
dash
violently
,
while
she
be
almost
stun
by
the
oft
repeat
crashing
of
the
thunder
.
<EOS>
the
storm
rage
for
upward
of
an
hour
,
and
then
cease
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
two
hour
,
Emily
be
again
mount
,
and
borne
away
,
while
she
become
aware
of
the
party
be
increase
by
an
additional
member
—
a
woman
—
which
be
at
all
event
some
consolation
,
although
she
could
neither
speak
nor
see
,
owe
to
the
bandage
be
still
keep
around
her
mouth
and
eye
.
<EOS>
on
,
on
the
party
dash
;
now
up
some
steep
bluff
;
now
down
into
some
deep
dingle
;
now
through
a
forest
and
tangle
brushwood
;
now
over
a
barren
,
sandy
,
open
plain
;
now
through
stream
whose
water
swell
by
the
late
rain
roll
on
with
a
sullen
murmur
—
on
,
on
they
go
,
heed
no
obstruction
,
rarely
ever
speak
to
each
other
;
on
,
on
—
still
on
—
while
hour
after
hour
go
by
,
and
yet
no
pause
.
<EOS>
at
length
they
halt
once
more
to
gain
some
refreshment
,
and
Emily
feel
herself
remove
from
the
horse
she
have
ride
to
another
,
and
again
they
go
on
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
weary
by
excitement
and
travel
,
Emily
,
in
spite
of
her
struggle
to
the
contrary
,
gradually
sink
into
the
arm
of
Morpheus
,
and
for
the
time
her
trial
and
trouble
be
forget
.
<EOS>
as
when
we
fall
asleep
in
some
quiet
spot
with
no
sound
near
,
a
gentle
shake
or
noise
will
wake
us
,
so
when
we
sink
into
slumber
amid
confusion
,
silence
will
produce
the
same
effect
—
and
Emily
be
awaken
by
the
party
again
come
to
a
halt
.
<EOS>
on
open
her
eye
—
for
during
the
latter
part
of
her
ride
the
bandage
around
them
have
fall
off
—
she
find
herself
in
a
wild
,
mountainous
region
,
with
nothing
cheer
around
,
no
habitation
and
no
human
being
near
—
save
,
in
the
first
instance
,
a
kind
of
half
cave
and
hovel
in
the
side
of
a
steep
mountain
,
form
of
wood
,
rock
and
clay
;
and
,
in
the
last
,
the
rough
,
ugly
visage
of
her
two
captor
,
and
the
face
of
Hetty
Brogan
,
whom
she
recognise
with
a
thrill
of
joy
,
from
the
fact
that
she
be
a
woman
,
and
that
her
face
be
familiar
,
although
she
have
never
see
it
but
once
before
,
and
then
under
circumstance
by
no
means
pleasant
;
still
it
be
at
least
the
face
of
a
woman
,
one
too
she
have
see
before
,
and
it
give
her
joy
.
<EOS>
"well

be

Emily
to

follow
his
example

she
lead
the
way
into
the
hovel
-
cave
<EOS>
just
mention
,
without
give
her
a
word
of
explanation
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
gloomy
place
—
part
natural
,
part
artificial
—
in
one
of
the
wild
and
most
dismal
spot
to
be
find
on
the
mountain
line
the
bank
of
the
Osage
.
<EOS>
It
have
evidently
but
just
be
construct
or
refit
,
for
the
earth
within
—
the
only
floor
it
could
boast
—
be
soft
and
fresh
,
as
though
lately
place
there
by
the
spade
.
<EOS>
the
roof
be
form
of
a
large
projecting
rock
,
partly
embed
in
the
mountain
,
and
the
side
and
front
of
stone
,
brush
and
earth
throw
compactly
together
.
<EOS>
It
could
boast
a
rude
door
,
which
be
,
with
the
exception
of
two
loop
hole
,
the
only
place
to
admit
light
and
air
.
<EOS>
within
be
a
rough
table
,
whereon
lie
a
tinder
box
and
candle
—
one
or
two
rough
bench
make
of
log
—
and
a
rude
pen
at
one
end
,
fill
with
straw
,
which
be
to
answer
the
purpose
of
a
bed
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
apartment
into
which
Hetty
and
Emily
now
enter

the
latter
with
feeling
of
horror
and
disgust

"Oh

around

upon

"I

cut
up
badly

but
thar
's
one

the
line

as
run

do
not

not

remark
of
Hetty

<EOS>
"thar
'
,
I
shall
not

<EOS>
return
Hetty
,
who
feel
offend
that
her
fortune

power
have
be
thus
slight

<EOS>
"
I
will
not

so
do

<EOS>
and
true
to
her
word
,
from
that
moment
emily
could
get
nothing
out
of
her
.
<EOS>
leave
to
herself
and
her
own
gloomy
reflection
—
apprehend
something
terrible
to
come
—
with
Emily
,
the
day
,
as
may
be
conjecture
,
wear
wearily
away
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
to
happen
?
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
her
fate
—
away
from
home
and
friend
,
and
no
voice
to
whisper
in
her
ear
a
single
word
of
consolation
and
hope
?
<EOS>
and
John
—
a
man
she
believe
capable
of
any
act
however
devilish
—
what
be
his
design
upon
her
?
<EOS>
She
remember
his
dark
,
mysterious
word
of
threaten
,
and
shudder
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
why
have
she
not
make
them
know
,
and
be
save
this
terrible
result
?
<EOS>
and
Edward
,
what
must
be
his
feeling
to
find
her
go
so
suddenly
,
and
no
trace
leave
whereby
he
could
glean
an
inkling
of
her
fate
?
<EOS>
and
her
guardian
too
<EOS>
,
how
must
he
feel?—and
Rufus
,
whose
prophetic
word
be
sound
like
a
death
-
knell
in
her
ear
?
<EOS>
She
may
in
truth
never
see
him
again
on
earth
.
<EOS>
alas
—
alas
—
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
as
one
by
one
such
thought
as
these
come
rush
through
her
brain
,
she
feel
her
head
throb
and
ache
,
and
deem
but
little
more
would
drive
her
mad
.
<EOS>
thus
pass
one
of
the
long
day
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
towards
night
Hetty
place
some
refreshment
on
the
table
,
which
she
have
find
in
a
basket
;
but
Emily
refuse
to
eat
,
and
early
retire
to
her
rude
bed
,
only
to
pass
a
horrible
night
of
feverish
anxiety
,
and
to
dream
,
whenever
she
sleep
,
strange
fantastic
dream
,
that
awake
her
with
a
shudder
start
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
she
arise
with
red
,
swollen
eye
,
and
a
pale
,
sickly
look
.
<EOS>
She
endeavor
to
eat
a
little
to
support
nature
,
for
she
feel
herself
grow
weak
,
but
her
stomach
refuse
food
;
and
faint
,
and
exhausted
,
she
retire
again
to
her
pallet
of
straw
.
<EOS>
from
time
to
time
Hetty
glance
at
her
with
an
uneasy
,
anxious
look
,
but
still
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
as
the
day
wear
on
,
Emily
begin
to
feel
more
and
more
the
horror
of
her
situation
—
her
brain
be
press
to
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
her
fate
?
<EOS>
this
silent
suspense
be
terrible
—
terrible
!
<EOS>
It
be
take
away
her
reason!—and
<EOS>
she
feel
that
any
fate
,
even
death
itself
,
would
be
preferable
to
this
brain
-
work
torture
.
<EOS>
Noon
come
,
but
bring
no
relief
;
and
as
the
afternoon
wane
away
,
Emily
feel
she
be
grow
mad
.
<EOS>
at
length
she
start
up
and
listen
.
<EOS>
She
fancy
she
hear
a
distant
footfall
.
<EOS>
a
few
moment
of
anxiety
confirm
it
,
and
she
could
hear
distinctly
the
tramp
of
a
horse
.
<EOS>
then
it
pause
,
and
Emily
's
heart
beat
fast
.
<EOS>
presently
she
hear
a
rustling
of
the
bush
.
<EOS>
the
sound
come
nearer
and
nearer
.
<EOS>
—
It
be
a
joyful
sound
,
let
what
would
follow
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
relief
from
that
dull
,
death
-
like
weariness
of
suspense
.
<EOS>
nearer
and
nearer
<EOS>
it
come
,
till
at
length
the
tall
,
dark
figure
of
John
Webber
fill
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
emily
sink
back
upon
her
pallet
with
strange
,
deep
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
one
she
wish
,
yet
dread
to
see
.
<EOS>
He
may
relieve
her
from
suspense
,
only
to
plunge
her
into
more
fearful
reality
.
<EOS>
without
ceremony
,
without
even
notice
Hetty
,
John
strode
directly
towards
Emily
,
and
when
within
a
few
foot
of
her
pause
.
<EOS>
—
as
he
catch
a
full
view
of
her
feature
,
there
be
a
slight
start
of
surprise
apparent
in
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
could
scarcely
credit
so
great
a
change
,
in
so
short
a
time
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Emily
,
and
so
we
meet
here
!
<EOS>
"
be
the
first
word
he
utter
,
in
a
tone
somewhat
stern
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
John
<EOS>
,
"
say
Emily
,
cast
upon
him
a
look
of
imploring
anguish
,
that
would
have
move
to
tear
of
pity
any
heart
less
hard
than
his
:
—
<EOS>
"
oh
,
John
,
how
could
you
be
so
cruel
—
to
take
me
,
who
have
be
rear
in
your
father

family
,
teach
to
look
upon
you
as
a
brother
,
and
treat
you
at
all
time
as
a
friend
<EOS>
—
how
could
you
take
me
away
from
home
,
and
all
I
love
,
by
the
hand
of
ruffian
,
and
bring
me
to
this
wild
,
uninhabited
region
?
<EOS>
oh
,
what
have
I
ever
do
,
that
I
should
receive
such
treatment
at
your
hands?""refuse
me
!

<EOS>
reply
John
,
contract
his
brow
.
<EOS>
"refused
<EOS>
you
,
because
I
do
not
,
could
not
love
you

Emily
,
"
and
because
I
would
not
perjure
myself
before
God
and
man
,
by
accept
your
hand
,
and
swear
to
love
and
cherish
you

<EOS>
but
be
this
to
excuse
you
before
high
Heaven
for
an
act
<EOS>
so
base?""i
seek
no
excuse

my
act

answer
John
,
smile
with
one
of
his
devilish
smile
.
<EOS>
"
rail
on
,
Emily
—
rail
on!—but
when
you
have
do
,
please
inform
me
why
you
think
you
be

hither
by
my
command

"
<EOS>
and
he
turn
his
dark
eye
upon
Hetty
,
who
tremble
and
grow
pale
.
<EOS>
"i
<EOS>
myself
hear
you
give
direction
,
at
the
place

Emily
,
notice
his
glance
and
the
agitation
of
Hetty
.
<EOS>
"
blame
her
not
for
this
—
for
if
your
command
to
her
be
silence

I
can
answer
that
you

strictly

<EOS>
since
yesterday
morning

to
all
my
entreaty
to
the
contrary
have
turn
a
deaf

""'tis

John

that
she
have
not

her
duty

so
it
seem
you
recognise
my
voice

well

you
know

better

I
will
not

my
will

here

<EOS>
I
see
you
when
you
depart
with
that
fellow
Merton

I
judge
by
the
course
you
take
where
you
may

too

what
they

task

what
you

you
know

lest
you
should
feign
ignorance

I
will
inform
you

You
will
remember
an
interview
we
have
a
short
time
since
,
during
which
I
offer
,

you
refuse
my
hand

I
then

you

be
mine

you
be
here
to
fulfil
that
oath

the
matter
you
perceive

<EOS>
six
month
ago
,
when
you
come
on
from
New
York
,
I
be
strike
with
your
appearance
;
and
think
much
on
you
,
your
kindness
to
me
in
day
go
by
,
and
your
affability
then
<EOS>
,
I
feel
for
you
what
some
enthusiastic
youth
would
probably
term
love
;
but
which
I
,
in
a
more
matter
of
fact
way
,
simply
term
a
fancy
,
or
an
attachment
.
<EOS>
think
much
on
this
,
I
finally
resolve
you
should
be
mine
at
a
no
distant
day
.
<EOS>
a
resolve
with
me
be
but
the
precursor
of
a
result
—
as
I
do
not
like
to
break
one
,
for
fear
of
set
myself
a
bad
example
.
<EOS>
well
,
to
cut
matter
short
,
I
see
you
a
few
day
since
—
alone
—
tell
you
of
my

to
almost
any

another

<EOS>
You

remember
the
conversation
in
my
father

house
on
the
evening
of
that
day

You
will
remember
,
too

that
the
Jew
may
have
in
his

proof
of
your
parentage

<EOS>
the
suggestion
seem
to
me
a

<EOS>
well
,
on
that

night
—
while
you
be
probably

of

foolish
thing

I
see
the
Jew
and
obtain
those
proof

answer
John

proof

sufficient

establish
you
an
heiress
of
noble
birth

""O

a
look
of
sorrow

while
the
smile
we
have
previously
describe
around
her
mouth
,
be
mournful
.
<EOS>
Her
feature
be
pale
,
exhibit
token
of
much
anxiety

and
one
would
easily
be
lead
to
fancy
she
have
be
weep

<EOS>
behind
Inez
stand
the
slave
Cyntha
,
gaze
also
upon
the
bandit
captain
,
with
an
expression
little
less
sad
than
that
of
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
for
some
five
minute
Bonardi
sit
in
the
same
position
,
during
which
time
not
a
muscle
of
his
feature
change
,
as
though
make
fast
by
the
spell
of
some
deep
revery
,
while
the
other
two
,
immoveable
as
himself
,
gaze
on
in
silence
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
start
,
and
with
a
deep
draw
sigh
relax
his
rigidity
of
expression
,
and
his
eye
wander
to
those
of
Inez
with
a
soft
glance
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
Inez
notice
the
change
,
than
with
an
airy
bind
<EOS>
she
spring
forward
,
throw
her
soft
arm
around
his
neck
,
bury
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
,
while
her
dark
curl
mingle
playfully
with
his
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
Inez
,
my
own
dear
Inez
,
"
say
Ronald
,
in
a
low
,
tender
voice
,
far
sweet
to
her
ear
than
the
soft
note
of
music
,
"
my
own
dear
Inez
,
you
at
least
be
true
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
throw
one
arm
around
her
waist
,
draw
her
fondly
to
him
,
and
,
as
she
turn
her
eye
towards
him
,
now
moist
with
tear
,
press
a
kiss
of
love
upon
her
rosy
lip
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
own
dear
Inez
,
you
at
least
be
true!""True
,
Ronald
,
"
murmured
Inez
,
"
ay
,
true
,
true
,
forever
,
ever
true
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
bow
her
head
upon
his
breast
and
weep
.
<EOS>
"
but
why
do
you
say
thus
,
dear
Ronald
,
and
why
do
you
look
so
grieved
and
anger
to
-
day
?
"
<EOS>
enquire
she
at
length
,
look
up
with
a
sigh
.
"
<EOS>
be
not
all
true
,
dear
ronald?""no
,
dear
,
"
reply
he
,
compress
his
lip
,
"
all
be
not
true
:
I
would
to
Heaven
they
be
!
<EOS>
but
they
at
least
shall
find
me
true
to
what
I
have
swear
.
<EOS>
""There
be
trouble
then
,
dear
Ronald
,
and
danger
perhaps
,
"
say
Inez
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"there
<EOS>
be
trouble
,
Inez
,
much
trouble
;
but
I
apprehend
no
danger
as
yet
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
few
treacherous
spirit
to
deal
with
,
and
then
I
trust
all
will
be
well
.
<EOS>
My
letter
from
abroad
bring
me
bad
news
.
<EOS>
three
of
my
good
man
,
whom
I
send
forth
as
spy
,
be
dead
,
through
their
own
imprudence
.
<EOS>
one
shot
in
a
street
fight
in
Cincinnati
;
one
kill
in
a
duel
in
New
Orleans
;
and
the
third
,
in
New
York
,
for
shoot
a
man
on
a
slight
provocation
,
have
be
try
and
execute
.
<EOS>
this
be
sad
news
to
receive
by
one
post
,
for
they
be
all
try
man
and
true
.
<EOS>
each
have
in
his
possession
private
paper
of
great
moment
,
from
two
of
whom
they
be
recover
by
their
comrade
,
immediately
after
their
death
;
but
with
regard
to
the
third
,
the
one
execute
in
New
York
,
it
have
not
turn
out
so
well
—
his
paper
have
be
seize
upon
by
the
authority
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
fear
how
it
may
terminate
;
for
in
those
so
lost
,
be
a
secret
plan
of
extend
our
band
in
that
quarter
;
in
fact
,
of
establish
a
league
,
the
head
quarter
of
which
should
be
here
,
throughout
different
section
of
the
United
States
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
secret
correspondence
be
write
in
an
invisible
ink
,
which
will
only
show
when
the
paper
be
heat
,
while
in
ordinary
ink
be
write
something
entirely
foreign
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
it
probable
they
will
warm
the
paper
—
if
not
,
<EOS>
all
be
safe
;
and
even
should
they
do
so
<EOS>
,
I
fancy
the
content
,
by
reason
of
the
character
introduce
,
will
prevent
them
from
make
any
thing
of
them
that
will
lead
to
our
detection
:
still
I
would
they
have
them
not
.
<EOS>
in
the
neighborhood
of
Cincinnati
we
have
already
find
a
few
bold
heart
who
be
ready
and
willing
to
join
us
.
<EOS>
but
enough
of
this
,
dear
Inez
,
for
it
be
matter
that
scarcely

and
of

can
not

""Any

with

firm

""You

will

sudden
start

of

party
present

with
some
few
it

with
a
slight
paleness

all

Piketon

bring
up

low
curse

deep
imprecation

horrible

in

ugly

quiver

coward'y

the
stoop

Jew

Piketon
lead
him
forward

his
small
black
eye
turn
with
a
rapid

sickly
glance
from
one
to
the

he
see
nothing

such
dark

stern

angry
look

make
his

shrink
within
him

good
shentlemen

silence

Bonardi

in

voice

thunder

You

insolence

a

to
his

again
ere
speak

send
a
bullet
through
his

<EOS>
Piketon
instantly
obey
,
and
the
Jew
,
know
the
command
would
be
promptly
execute
to
the
letter
,
stand
mute
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
remember
,
gentleman
,
"
say
Ronald
,
"
that
when
we
meet
here
last
,
one
of
our
party
,
Curdish
—
who
I
be
sorry
to
say
be
now
absent
—
insinuate
in
rather
strong
term
that
the
Jew
intend
to
betray
us
—
or
to
that
effect
—
but
at
the
same
time
be
not
willing
to
swear
to
it
.
<EOS>
—
You
will
also
recollect
that
I
order
him
under
arrest
,
and
tell
you
the
matter
should
be
look
to
.
<EOS>
I
question
him
in
private
,
and
learn
enough
to
be
satisfied
that
for
the
present
our
safety
may
depend
upon
have
the
Jew
closely
watch
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
wish
also
to
give
the
latter
a
fair
opportunity
to
forego
any
wicked
design
he
may
have
in
contemplation
,
and
to
talk
with
him
on
some
other
matter
,
I
order
him
under
arrest
likewise
.
<EOS>
during
my
examination
of
him
,
I
become
more
than
ever
convince
that
he
be
meditate
treachery
;
and
my
last
word
to
him
be
,
`
go
Jew
,
but
beware
,
for
a
sleepless
eye
will
be
upon
you
!
'
<EOS>
He
make
no
reply
,
but
there
be
in
his
countenance
a
look
of
savage
cunning
,
which
seem
to
say
,
`
I
shall
outwit
and
betray
you
.
'
<EOS>
so
I
interpret
it
;
and
as
soon
as
he
be
go
,
I
call
one
of
my
sentinel
—
a
man
in
whom
I
have
implicit
confidence
,
both
as
to
be
trust
,
and
possess
sufficient
cunning
to
overreach
the
Jew
—
relate
the
whole
matter
,
bade
him
dog
his
step
,
and
take
whatever
measure
he
may
see
proper
to
learn
if
my
suspicious
be
correct
;
and
,
if
so
,
so
soon
as
he
could
gather
proof
sufficient
,
to
bring
him
hither
—
which
latter
you
perceive

gentleman

have
be
do
.
<EOS>
now
for
the
proof

forth

looking

reply
Hendrick
,
calmly
.
"enough
!
<EOS>
now
let
us
hear
your
testimony
in
regard
to
David
.
<EOS>
""Shall
I
relate
everything
that
occur
,
captain?""No
,
it
be
unnecessary
for
us
to
waste
time
.
<EOS>
—
relate
only
that
which
bear
directly
on
his
treasonable
design
.
<EOS>
""well
,
then
,
"
begin
Hendrick
,
"
after
follow
the
Jew
through
all
his
crook
and
turn
,
until
he
reach
his
place
of
abode
,
on
the
bank
of
the
Mississippi
,
which
he
do
about
dusk
on
the
third
day
from
his
leaving
here
—
have
travel
the
whole
distance
on
foot
—
<EOS>
I
determine
,
if
possible
,
to
secrete
myself
within
his
hovel
,
where
I
judge
I
should
be
the
better
able
to
learn
of
his
private
intention
.
<EOS>
fortunately
his
own
imprudence
favor
me
in
the
first
,
as
his
tongue
afterwards
do
in
the
last
.
<EOS>
by
great
adroitness
I
manage
to
keep
him
within
sight
the
whole
distance
,
and
remain
myself
unseen
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
say
,
he
reach
his
hovel
about
dusk
of
the
third
day
;
and
the
shadow
of
the
come
night
favor
me
,
I
be
enable
to
be
close
upon
him
when
he
enter
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
my
surprise
he
do
not
close
and
bolt
his
door
immediately
,
and
avail
myself
of
this
,
a
moment
or
two
after
<EOS>
,
I
noiselessly
follow
him
across
the
threshold
,
and
find
him
engage
with
flint
and
steel
in
strike
a
light
.
<EOS>
the
flash
from
the
steel
enable
me
to
perceive
a
table
,
which
I
succeed
in
reach
,
and
conceal
myself
under
,
without
alarm
him
.
<EOS>
after
have
light
a
candle
,
he
proceed
to
bolt
his
door
,
and
then
,
as
if
he
feel
himself
entirely
free
from
danger
,
let
off
a
volley
of
curse
and
all
manner
of
imprecation
on
the
bandit
,
its
captain
especially
,
which
he
finish
by
swear
to
have
revenge
on
the
whole
party
.
<EOS>
after
this
,
for
a
time
,
he
become
more
quiet
,
and
proceed
to
a
kind
of
closet
,
regale
himself
with
food
.
<EOS>
this
done
,
he
seat
himself
by
the
table
,
underneath
which
I
be
lie
,
and
for
some
two
hour
be
silent
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
begin
again
,
by
utter
the
word
revenge
,
and
swear
he
would
have
it
on
those
who
have
foil
him
in
a
matter
concern
some
girl
;
that
to
get
this
revenge
,
he
would
,
on
the
follow
day
,
proceed
to
St.
Louis
,
betray
the
band
,
and
secure
the
reward
offer
for
our
captain
's
head
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Hendrick
say
this
,
several
of
the
party
present
,
unable
longer
to
smother
their
wrath
,
burst
into
a
yell
of
rage
,
with
cry
of
,
"

knife
and
pistol
flash
in
the
light
of
the
torch
,
and
some
few
move
forward
as
if
to
seize
the
Jew
,
who
,
ghastly
and
breathless
,
be
nearly
faint
with
terror

<EOS>
"Hold

Bonardi

waive
his

with
dignity

"

in
an
instant
that
rough
sea
of
passion

calm
as
a
still
lake

when
Ronald
again
add
,

on

brief

""raile

Hendrick

finally
touch
upon
his
money
,
some
paper
in
his
possession
,
and
how
good
he
may
dispose
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
""Yes

say
Bonardi
,
quickly
,
interrupt
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
well
,
what
of
the
papers?""why
,
as
I
do
not
understand
the
allusion
,
"
answer
Hendrick
,
"
I
pay
but
<EOS>
little
regard
to
his
remark
;
though
I
remember
his
mutter
something
about
dispose
of
them
to
some
one
who
love
the
girl
,
probably
mean
the
same
one
he
have
allude
to
before

<EOS>
""The
same

doubtless
,

continue

<EOS>
""After
go
on
in
this
manner
sometime

proceed
to
the
closet

bring
forth
a
bag

some
paper

<EOS>
the
bag
contain
money

as
I
could
tell
by
hear
him
empty
it
on
the
table

and
for
a
full
hour
he
amuse
himself
,
as
nigh
as
I
could
judge
,
in
count

handle
it
,
and
some
half
hour
more
in
examine
the
paper
,
when
he
return
them
to
the
closet

<EOS>
while
there
,
I
hear
him
mutter
something
about
kill
some
one
;
then
he
come
for
the
light
,
and
seem
much
agitate

<EOS>
soon
after
he
go
back
,
the
light
disappear
,
and
curiosity
prompt
me
,
I
creep
forth
to
learn
what
have
become

<EOS>
I
enter
the
closet
carefully

,
to
my
surprise
,
find
a
trap

door
raise
,
lead
down
into
a
vault
,
from
which
issue
a
stench
so
disagreeable
,
that
I
immediately
retire
,
but
not
until
I
have
hear
some
word
pass
with
one
below
,
whom
the
Jew
,
as
I
judge
,
have
go
down
to
murder
.
<EOS>
""Indeed

!

remark
Ronald

with
interest

"
here

the

in
his

astonishment
at
hear
all

just
at
this

I
be
astonish
by

the
approach

horse

follow
immediately
,
a
knocking
on
the
door

with
a
demand
for
admittance

I
creep
under

what
I

enquire
in
a
tremble

Bonardi
:

Well?""The

out

some

indifference

<EOS>
Bonardi

seem
composed

with

unshaken
determination

there
be

a
slight
paleness
in

an

compression
of

as

suddenly
to

his

into

from

by

"The

come
a
sharp
report
—
a
shudder
pass
through

and
the
Jew

with
a
ghastly
contortion
of

fall
back
without

His

the

Ronald

after
a
moment

pause

in
a
tone
so
deep
and
solemn
almost
sepulchral

that

and
turn
away

he
slowly
retrace
his
step
to
the
farther
end

again
mount
the
stand

<EOS>
"
bear

when
some
of
you
will
take
it
in

to

row
a
short
distance
up

cast
it
upon

end
the

Jew

<EOS>
"As

lay

up

you

<EOS>
""But
,

,
Hendrick
,
no
remark

I
would
have
it
so
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
comrade
,
I
have
something
important
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
listen
!
<EOS>
You
will
remember
that
for
some
time
past
we
have
hold
in
contemplation
an
attack
on
a
rich
planter
live
in
Tennessee
.
<EOS>
to
speak
candidly
my
own
mind
,
I
must
say
the
design
never
suit
me
;
and
in
its
place
I
have
one
to
offer
,
which
I
trust
will
meet
your
approbation
.
<EOS>
some
two
or
three
day
since
,
I
receive
a
letter
from
one
of
my
secret
agent
in
New
Orleans
,
which
inform
me
that
of
late
there
have
be
a
great
run
on
the
bank
there
for
specie
;
and
that
to
supply
the
demand
,
they
will
be
force
to
borrow
,
for
a
time
,
from
neighbor
city
;
and
that
he
believe
an
order
have
already
be
send
to
St.
Louis
for
a
large
sum
,
which
doubtless
would
shortly
pass
down
on
one
of
the
steamer
,
and
which
,
should
we
be
fortunate
enough
to
capture
,
would
in
all
probability
make
our
fortune
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
have
read
this
,
I
set
to
work
to
learn
the
truth
of
it
;
and
as
I
be
well
known
among
the
merchant
and
man
of
wealth
in
St.
Louis
,
as
a
speculator
in
land
,
under
a
different
cognoman
,
I
be
not
long
in
find
it
fully
corroborate
.
<EOS>
by
dint
of
perseverence
,
I
have
be
enable
to
learn
that
a
boat
,
which
leave
within
a
few
day
,
will
carry
this
money
;
of
the
amount
I
be
yet
ignorant
,
though
without
question
the
sum
will
be
large
.
<EOS>
My
plan
be
this
:
I
will
ascertain
to
a
certainty
the
day
of
her
leaving
,
and
also
the
hour
.
<EOS>
I
will
learn
,
too
,
the
speed
of
the
boat
,
and
calculate
the
distance
,
so
that
we
may
find
a
good
point
to
station
ourselves
,
where
the
current
hug
the
western
shore
,
and
where
she
will
pass
about
dark
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
I
will
procure
several
skiff
,
and
have
them
float
down
to
the
rendezvous
.
<EOS>
these
must
be
man
,
and
lie
conceal
under
cover
of
the
bank
until
the
give
signal
.
<EOS>
as
the
steamer
heave
in
sight
,
some
two
or
three
of
our
party
must
hail
her
from
the
bank
,
when
she
,
under
the
impression
that
they
wish
to
take
passage
,
will
lay
to
and
send
out
a
boat
.
<EOS>
as
the
latter
touch
the
shore
,
the
oarsman
must
be
seize
,
gag
and
bind
,
quickly
and
quietly
,
while
some
three
of
our
party
will
instantly
leap
into
the
boat
and
row
back
.
<EOS>
instead
of
approach
the
large
boat
direct
,
they
will
cross
her
bow
,
and
when
on
the
other
side
,
will
seemingly
get
into
a
fight
,
and
discharge
several
pistol
.
<EOS>
this
of
course
will
attract
the
attention
of
all
on
board
the
steamer
,
and
be
the
signal
for
the
conceal
boat
to
shoot
out
and
approach
her
on
the
larboard
side
—
her
head
be
up
stream
—
which
must
be
do
with
lightning
speed
,
but
without
noise
.
<EOS>
these
,
however
,
will
be
command
by
Piketon
and
myself
.
<EOS>
the
moment
we
come
along
side
,
some
of
the
bold
and
most
agile
of
our
party
will
follow
me
in
leap
on
board
,
where
will
be
find
three
of
our
band
,
who
have
come
down
from
St.
Louis
,
ready
to
show
us
where
the
money
be
stow
,
and
assist
us
in
get
it
into
our
boat
.
<EOS>
the
money
will
be
find
in
small
cask
,
which
can
be
easily
handle
,
and
,
to
succeed
,
must
be
handle
expeditiously
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
probable
that
we
can
remove
it
all
;
but
in
the
confusion
that
will
ensue
,
doubtless
enough
to
enrich
us
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
press
hard
,
we
must
discharge
some
of
our
pistol
,
not
with
the
intention
of
wounding
,
but
merely
to
frighten
,
and
thicken
the
confusion
,
while
at
the
same
time
we
will
add
the
old
cry
,
which
I
trust
be
not
yet
forget
:
`
<EOS>
yield
to
the
attack
of
Ronald
Bonardi
!
'
<EOS>
We
must
keep
a
plenty
of
undischarged
pistol
by
us
,
however
,
to
be
use
only
in
case
of
extreme
necessity
,
and
then
not
to
take
life
if
it
can
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
have
accomplish
our
design
,
I
will
give
the
signal
by
a
shrill
whistle
,
when
each
man
must
spring
for
his
boat
,
and
row
as
for
life
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
We
will
then
knock
out
the
head
of
the
cask
,
empty
the
money
into
bag
,
throw
them
across
our
saddle
,
(
for
our
horse
must
be
in
waiting
,
close
at
hand
)
<EOS>
mount
and
away
,
in
various
direction
,
to
rendezvous
here
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
such
be
my
plan
.
<EOS>
"As
he
conclude
,
the
cave
echo
with
three
tremendous
cheer
,
and
"
long
live
Ronald
Bonardi
,
"
when
he
immediately
responded:"I
be
pleased
,
gentleman
,
to
know
that
my
project
find
with
you
so
much
favor
;
but
I
will
not
disguise
from
you
,
what
I
can
not
from
myself
,
that
my
plan
may
fail
;
and
at
the
good
,
will
be
attend
with
a
great
deal
of
danger
,
perhaps
loss
of
life
;
and
,
furthermore
,
that
it
will
in
all
probability
rouse
up
the
country
against
us
,
as
be
do
heretofore
.
<EOS>
in
the
latter
case
,
each
must
make
his
way
out
of
it
as
quietly
as
possible
,
and
remain
until
the
storm
have
blow
over
.
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
and
now
,
a
word
or
two
more
,

I
have
do
.
<EOS>
You
will
each
and
all
of
you
hold
yourself
in
readiness
for
a
moment

warning
,
with
horse
well
feed
and
rest
for
a
long
journey
.
<EOS>
when
you
hear
the
signal
of
three
blast
on
a
bugle
,
be
it
night
or
day
,
you
will
mount
and
ride
to
the
river
.
<EOS>
the
rendezvous
be
the
hut
of
the
traitor
Jew
,
where
you
will
learn
more
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
so
soon
as
Piketon
have
make
a
division
of
the
money
,
you
will
quietly
disperse
to
your
several
home
,
and
hold
yourself
,
as
I
say
before
,
prepare
for
any
event
.
<EOS>
for
your
kind
attention

I
thank
you

"descende

open
the
stone
door

enter
the
Chieftain

with

such
loneliness

such
utter
desolation

as
she
do
after
the
disappearance
of
Hetty

as
record
in
a
previous
chapter
.
<EOS>
on
her
she
fancy
now
hang
her
destiny
,
life
or
death
.
<EOS>
Would
she
succeed
?
<EOS>
the
very
thought
of
a
failure
make
her
shudder
with
horror
.
<EOS>
She
have
feel
lonely
and
desolate
while
Hetty
be
with
her
,
but
now
she
feel
doubly
so
.
<EOS>
then
at
least
she
be
in
the
presence
of
a
human
being
—
one
of
her
own
sex
—
<EOS>
but
now
she
be
alone,—alone
,
too
,
in
a
wild
,
mountainous
region
;
not
only
far
from
friend
,
but
<EOS>
,
for
aught
she
know
to
the
contrary
,
far
from
civilization
,
with
a
dark
and
awful
cloud
rest
upon
her
mental
sight
,
and
weigh
down
her
spirit
.
<EOS>
She
throw
herself
upon
her
pallet
and
try
to
be
compose
;
but
she
only
roll
to
and
fro
with
the
more
feverish
anxiety
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
hope
for
the
good
,
and
in
her
imagination
draw
bright
picture
of
the
future
;
but
dark
,
shadowy
form
,
like
evil
phantom
,
would
come
between
,
and
the
sunny
spot
go
out
in
gloom
.
<EOS>
thus
hour
on
hour
go
by
—
each
increase
,
rather
than
diminish
,
her
soul
-
torture
anxiety
—
while
night
creep
gradually
on
,
to
add
its
horror
,
until
Emily
feel
herself
draw
to
the
very
verge
of
despair
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
some
two
hour
later
,
she
hear
step
approach
;
and
then
she
could
almost
hear
too
the
beating
of
her
own
heart
,
so
wildly
it
palpitate
.
<EOS>
be
they
step
of
friend
or
foe
?
<EOS>
a
few
moment
serve
to
decide
;
for
the
voice
of
him
she
fear
-
too
soon
hear
—
be
of
itself
sufficient
to
announce
the
bad
.

John

enter

"How

reply
Emily

in

voice

""Ha

so

all
very

somewhat
excited

you

there
be
no

house

that
you

"Why

simply
this

John

You
have
decide

extreme
with

farther

out

up

waver

have
seem
so
willing

feel
differently

would
even

resolution

resolution
be
to
effect
by
duplicity
what
he
could

<EOS>
in
a
moment
all
trace
of
anger
have
pass
from
his

in

calm
voice
he
said:"Captain

extend
south
of

Missouri
some
thirty
mile

ever

anon
this
horseman
would
pause
beside
some
peace

look
cottage
,
and
sound
three
clear
distinct
blast
on
a
bugle
;
and
then
a
dark
figure
or
two
would
be
see
to
glide
forth
from
his
covert
,
a
few
hurried
word
would
be
say
in
a
low
voice
;
and
then
again
the
single
horseman
would
dash
on
,
as
though
ride
for
life
,
while
shortly
after
,
from
the
place
he
have
just
quit
,
another
horseman
—
sometimes
two
or
three
—
would
ride
forth
with
speed

in
hot
pursuit

the
one
who
have
go
before

the
grey
dawn
of
morning

begin

the
outline

hill

in
a
soft

hazy
relief

reveal

the
dim
outline

that

horseman

far
to
the
eastward

where
he
have
be
see
at
the
hour
of
midnight

still
speed
on

before

ever

anon
pause
to
sound
three
musical
blast
on
a
bugle

he
bear
in
his
hand

<EOS>
as
the
sun
rise
in
beauty
over
the
eastern
hills
,
and
pour
his
gentle
ray
into
deep
green
wood
,
into
pleasant
valley
,
on
to
sparkle
stream
,
they
occasionally
cast
back
the
shadow
of
that
horseman
,
still
speed
on
,

the
shadow
too
of
various
other
horseman
—
some
directly
in
his
trail

some
in
different
point
of
compass
from
him

all
speed
eastward

as
the
day
wear
on
,
he
be
see
mount
on

different
horse

still
urge
on
the
noble
animal

which
at
every
step
and
bind
near
him
to
the
great
Mississippi

<EOS>
when
the
sun
have
far
decline
toward
the
western
horizon

horseman
draw
rein

old

stand
on

bank

be

be
to
be
make
precisely
accord
to
the
plan
give
out
by
Bonardi
,
as
detail
in
a
previous
chapter
.
<EOS>
have
see
his
man
dispose
of
accord
to
his
direction
,
Bonardi
go
to
each
of
the
sentinel
,
and
charge
them
to
be
vigilant
,
as
it
be
not
impossible
that
Webber
,
in
a
spirit
of
revenge
,
have
already
blow
the
scheme
,
and
,
by
be
sharply
on
the
look
-
out
,
be
enable
to
learn
of
their
sudden
movement
,
the
time
of
the
steamer
's
departure
,
and
also
to
collect
a
force
sufficient
to
attack
them
.
<EOS>
Should
they
see
or
hear
any
thing
they
may
judge
indicative
of
danger
,
without
be
positive
,
they
be
to
give
the
signal
by
a
shrill
whistle
—
if
positive
,
by
discharge
a
pistol
.
<EOS>
in
case
of
an
attack
,
they
be
to
fight
in
any
manner
they
may
see
proper
;
but
in
case
they
hear
a
blast
from
the
bugle
,
they
be
to
make
their
way
,
quickly
as
possible
,
to
the
spot
whence
it
proceed
.
<EOS>
have
give
these
direction
to
the
sentinel
,
Bonardi
repair
to
the
member
whose
duty
it
be
to
act
on
land
—
tell
them
his
suspicion
—
his
order
to
the
sentinel
regard
signal
,
and
an
attack
—
the
latter
of
which
refer
equally
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
this
done
,
he
return
to
the
boat
,
repeat
all
he
have
say
,
and
take
his
station
in
one
of
them
,
ready
to
lead
them
on
when
the
proper
moment
should
arrive
.
<EOS>
all
now
gradually
sink
into
deep
silence
,
for
each
one
of
that
band
of
outlaw
be
busy
with
thought
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
They
be
await
,
under
cover
of
darkness
,
to
make
an
attack
,
where
,
in
all
probability
,
more
or
less
life
would
be
lose
;
and
doubtless
many
a
one
feel
a
secret
foreboding
that
this
may
be
his
last
night
on
earth
.
<EOS>
although
Bonardi
,
after
give
his
order
,
say
nothing
,
yet
he
appear
very
restless
,
and
seem
greatly
disturb
by
some
inward
trouble
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
pass
some
fifteen
minute
,
when
he
leap
suddenly
ashore
,
and
merely
say
he
would
be
with
them
again
presently
,
strode
directly
up
the
hill
,
and
enter
the
hovel
.
<EOS>
here
he
find
a
bottle
,
which
he
apply
to
his
lip
,
and
,
judge
by
the
time
he
hold
it
there
,
drink
much
.
<EOS>
He
then
return
to
the
boat
with
a
heavy
step
.
<EOS>
"strange
,
"
say
he
,
as
he
approach
,
"
that
I
hear
nothing
of
her
!
<EOS>
Piketon
,
it
be
possible
Ellis
may
have
be
mistake
in
the
time
.
<EOS>
""It
be
possible
,
captain
,
"
answer
Piketon
,
"
though
<EOS>
but
now
I
fancy
I
hear
her
.
""hark
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Bonardi
,
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
Piketon
,
you
be
right
;
by
heaven
she
come
!
<EOS>
be
ready
,
man
,
be
ready
—
then
be
silent!"A
few
minute
fully
confirm
the
approach
of
a
steamer
;
for
although
not
in
sight
,
yet
the
puff
sound
produce
by
the
escape
of
steam
,
be
clearly
audible
to
the
anxious
listener
.
<EOS>
Ere
she
round
the
point
just
above
,
it
become
evident
by
the
change
of
sound
,
that
she
be
effect
a
landing
;
but
presently
she
be
again
in
motion
;
and
then
on
she
come
,
like
some
terrific
monster
,
with
great
red
eye
of
fire
,
and
smoke
and
flame
issue
from
its
nostril
.
<EOS>
on
,
on
she
come
,
bear
down
apparently
directly
towards
those
dark
spirit
,
who
be
impatiently
wait
their
time
for
action
.
<EOS>
soon
she
be
within
speak
distance
,
when
she
be
immediately
hail
from
the
shore
,
which
be
answer
by
the
ringing
of
a
bell
.
<EOS>
the
steam
be
next
throw
off
,
and
she
commence
round
to
,
apparently
with
much
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"We
can
not
land
,
"
say
a
voice
from
on
board
,
"
and
our
boat
have
be
stave
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
no
boat
,
we
shall
be
oblige
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
""ha
!
<EOS>
this
look
suspicious
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculate
Ronald
,
mentally
.
<EOS>
"
but
the
trial
must
be
make
.
<EOS>
quick
,
Jeffrey
,
"
cry
he
,
leap
ashore
,
and
run
up
to
the
group
of
three
,
who
stand
as
though
await
further
order
,
"
cry
back
there
be
a
boat
here
,
and
a
man
who
will
row
you
to
them
!
<EOS>
and
then
hie
to
it
,
and
do
not
forget
your
instruction
.
<EOS>
You
,
"
continue
he
,
turn
to
another
group
of
twelve
,
stand
a
few
foot
distant
,
six
of
whom
have
but
lately
arrive
,
"
will
remain
here
to
cover
us

<EOS>
I
be
suspicious
,
from
various
slight
cause
,
that
we
shall
be
attack
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
,
fight
,
man
,
fight
like
devil
,
and
we
will
soon
join
you
!
"
<EOS>
—
say
this
in
a
low
,
rapid
tone
,
Bonardi
hurry
back
and
spring
into
his
boat
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
Jeffrey
have
do
the
captain
's
bidding
,
with
great
rapidity
,
and
be
even
now
,
with
his
two
comrade
,
shove
off
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
this
time
so
dark
,
that
a
small
boat
on
the
water
could
be
see
only
at
a
short
distance
,
save
when
it
cross
the
light
gleam
out
from
the
large
one
;
consequently
the
other
boat
remain
in
close
obscurity
.
<EOS>
scarcely
a
minute
elapse
,
ere
a
boat
,
contain
three
individual
,
be
see
cross
the
bow
of
the
steamer

<EOS>
"stand
<EOS>
to
your
oar

man
!
"
say
Bonardi
,
rapidly
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
hear
the
signal
in
a
moment
;
and
then
,
as
you
love
money
,
forget
not
to
row
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
there
it
be
!
"
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
there
come
several
report
of
firearm
,
and
the
next
instant
five
boat
shoot
out
into
the
stream
,
with
lightning
rapidity
.
<EOS>
but
a
few
second
elapse
ere
they
be
alongside
the
steamer
,
when
,
just
as
Bonardi
be
on
the
point
of
leap
aboard
,
the
engineer
suddenly
let
on
a
full
head
of
steam
,
the
wheel
turn
quickly
,
the
boat
shoot
forwad
instantly
,
crush
one
of
the
small
one
,
and
at
the
same
time
a
murderous
fire
be
direct
among
the
bandit
,
from
a
hitherto
conceal
enemy
,
do
terrible
execution
.
<EOS>
several
of
them
spring
up
and
fall
back
dead
,
against
their
comrade
,
or
into
the
water
,
while
other
sink
down
wound
,
amid
shriek
,
groans
,
and
direful
imprecation
.
<EOS>
to
add
to
the
consternation
and
horror
of
Ronald
and
his
man
,
the
pistol
of
the
sentinel
on
the
hill
be
now
hear
in
quick
succession
,
follow
by
a
roar
of
musketry
,
rapid
discharge
of
pistol
,
fierce
yell
and
groans
,
and
the
noise
of
a
hand

to
-
hand
combat

<EOS>
by
the
light
of
the
discharge
,
Ronald
see
the
man

hem
in

<EOS>
"by

he

be
the

,
ere

almost
to
leap
from
the
water

so
powerfully

apply
by
desperate
man

<EOS>
but
a
landing
be
not
to

without
trouble

<EOS>
as
the
boat
touch
the
shore

a
party
in

pour
a
destructive
fire
among

and
number
fall

<EOS>
"Onward

shout
Bonardi
;
and
leap
on
to
the
bank
,
pistol
in
hand
,
he
shoot
down
the
two
near
him
—
dash
out
the
brain
of
a
third
with
one
of
his
discharge
weapon
—
seize
the
fourth
as
though
he
be
a
child
,
and
throw
him
over
his
head
into
the
Mississippi
—
draw
his
knife
,
and
literally
cut
his
way
through
them
,
unharmed
,
follow
by
Piketon
,
and
some
twenty
of
his
band

all
fighting

neither

nor
ask
quarter

"sound
<EOS>
the
bugle

shout
Bonardi

<EOS>
instantly
a
loud

clear
blast

ring
out
upon

follow
their
brave
leader

the
bandit
rush
down
the
stream
some
thirty
yard

to
where
their
horse
stand
in
wait
—
not
have
as
yet
be

the
attack
party

<EOS>
—
bound
into
their
saddle
,
with
the
agility
of
man
<EOS>
well
train
to
horsemanship
,
with
their
knife
still
in
their
hand
,
reek
with
blood
,
they
cut
the
rein
that
attach
them
to
the
small
tree
of
the
thicket

in
which
they
be
conceal
,
and
,
plunge
their
spur
into

side

ride
wildly
out

with

fierce
yell

come
up

in
thunder

the
voice
of
Bonardi

<EOS>
down
in
your
saddle

knife
to
their

be
a
terrible
order
obey
more
rapidly
.
<EOS>
at
the
word
,
each
wheel
into
a
line
with
his
leader
—
throw
himself
forward
,
until
his
head
touch
his
horse
's
neck
—
extend
his
arm
,
until
the
blade
of
his
knife
reach
beyond
the
nostril
of
the
animal
he
ride
—
and
<EOS>
then
,
like
a
sweeping
avalanche
,
the
whole
party
spur
down
upon
the
main
body
of
their
opponent
,
whom
they
stab
and
ride
over
,
with
a
havoc
that
,
in
honorable
warfare
,
would
have
render
the
charge
immortal

<EOS>
but
all
be
in
vain

<EOS>
the
bandit
have
be
surprise

take
at
too
great
a
disadvantage
to
themselves

by
nearly
double
their

<EOS>
in
the

just
make

five
more

so
that

on

only

"we

for

there
come
a
tremendous
explosion

the

watery

the

gleam
across
the
dark
,
rolling
water
of
the
Mississippi

upon
the
bank

tree

with
a
sickly
effect

the
outline

dark

on

some
standing

some
run

man

off

in
flight

with
a
yell
of
despair
,
he
turn
and
flee
.
<EOS>
that
yell
be
echo
by
some
fifteen
sturdy
horseman
,
who
immediately
join
in
pursuit
,
all
eager
for
his
heart

blood

<EOS>
the
cry
of
John

pursuer

be
hear
far
around
—
ring
out
upon
the
night
air
like
those
of
so
many
fiend
;
but
they
be
quickly
drown
by
still
loud
shout
of
,
"
the
bandit
,
the
bandits!—Bonardi
,
Bonardi
!
"
and
suddenly
wheel
their
animal
,
some
twenty
horseman
dash
madly
forward
,
to
join
in
the
wild
chase
.
<EOS>
Ere
we
follow
them
,
however
,
let
us
briefly
glance
at
the
cause
which
lead
to
these
result
,
take
one
more
look
at
the
scene
before
us
,
and
then
close
it
forever
.
<EOS>
after
the
escape
of
John
,
from
Piketon
and
his
companion
—
as
relate
in
the
chapter
precede
—
he
have
ride
directly
for
home
,
with
dark
thought
of
revenge
uppermost
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
know
if
take
,
death
would
assuredly
follow
,
as
he
have
that
evening
have
ample
witness
in
the
case
of
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
His
only
safety
he
now
feel
be
in
the
total
overthrow
of
Bonardi
and
the
bandit
;
and
to
effect
this
as
soon
as
possible
,
be
his
only
theme
,
as
he
spur
rapidly
on
.
<EOS>
in
do
this
,
he
would
not
only
secure
his
own
life
,
but
obtain
the
revenge
he
seek
on
those
who
have
dare
to
come
between
him
and
his
victim
.
<EOS>
but
how
to
effect
this
suddenly
,
be
the
main
object
.
<EOS>
at
first
he
think
of
seek
his
father
,
and
acquaint
him
of
the
whereabouts
of
Emily
,
and
the
rendezvous
of
the
bandit
—
state
that
she
have
be
seize
,
carry
off
,
and
be
now
hold
in
durance
by
them
.
<EOS>
this
he
know
would
rouse
the
ire
of
his
father
—
who
be
as
yet
ignorant
of
Bonardi
be
in
the
vicinity
—
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
,
he
would
raise
a
large
company
from
the
surround
country
,
go
forth
to
rescue
Emily
,
and
exterminate
the
band
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
even
at
the
good
,
would
consume
much
time
,
and
doubtless
prove
of
no
avail
;
from
the
fact
that
most
of
the
bandit
themselves
be
know
as
settler
,
and
so
scatter
through
the
country
,
that
the
least
stir
of
this
kind
would
be
know
to
them
in
season
to
effect
an
escape
,
or
,
what
be
more
probable
,
rally
themselves
into
a
body
,
ambush
,
and
slaughter
their
opponent
.
<EOS>
this
project
,
therefore
,
be
a
hazardous
one
;
the
more
so
,
as
in
the
meantime
they
may
seek
him
out
and
kill
him
;
and
he
know
sufficient
of
Ronald
Bonardi
,
to
render
this
thought
a
not
improbable
,
and
,
consequently
,
a
startling
one
.
<EOS>
They
may
even
now
be
on
his
trail
—
such
a
thing
be
not
unlikely
—
and
he
urge
his
beast
up
hill
and
down
,
over
hollow
and
plain
,
through
forest
,
thicket
and
stream
,
at
his
great
speed
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
find
,
to
his
regret
and
consternation
,
that
the
noble
animal
be
begin
to
falter
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
course
—
his
place
must
be
supply
by
another
;
and
in
this
,
chance
favor
him
;
for
shortly
after
,
he
ride
past
a
cottage
,
where
he
perceive
several
horse
lie
down
.
<EOS>
immediately
rein
in
,
he
alight
,
select
the
good
,
transfer
bridle
and
saddle
,
and
,
in
less
than
five
minute
,
be
again
speed
on
,
leave
his
own
horse
behind
him
.
<EOS>
when
the
sun
rise
,
he
be
within
twenty
mile
of
his
father
's
cottage
;
and
for
the
first
time
he
slacken
his
speed
,
to
meditate
upon
the
wise
course
for
him
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
a
thought
strike
him
!
<EOS>
He
would
ride
at
once
to
St.
Louis
,
learn
at
what
time
the
steamer
be
to
leave
,
and
possibly
he
may
hear
of
something
advantageous
to
his
foul
design
.
<EOS>
when
he
reach
home
,
some
two
hour
later
,
he
find
that
the
party
—
consist
of
his
father
,
Merton
,
Bernard
and
Tyrone
—
have
just
start
on
a
third
day
's
search
for
Emily
,
and
that
Rufus
be
lie
in
a
very
critical
state
.
<EOS>
this
latter
,
however
,
trouble
him
not
;
and
without
heed
anything
further
,
he
change
his
horse
,
and
immediately
set
off
for
St.
Louis
,
where
he
arrive
about
two
o'clock
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
He
know
from
Bonardi
's
plan
,
that
three
of
the
band
be
to
be
on
board
when
the
boat
should
leave
;
and
accordingly
he
at
once
repair
hither
,
to
learn
if
anything
new
have
occur
.
<EOS>
two
of
them
he
find
without
difficulty
,
and
learn
,
to
his
surprise
and
joy
,
that
the
boat
be
to
leave
that
evening
;
that
the
third
have
be
go
some
thirty
-
six
hour
to
inform
Bonardi
of
the
fact
;
and
that
it
be
suppose
the
latter
would
get
the
information
in
time
,
by
hard
riding
,
to
be
at
the
general
rendezvous
,
where
the
boat
,
owe
to
some
slight
delay
,
would
probably
pass
at
early
dark
.
<EOS>
than
this
information
,
nothing
could
have
suit
John
's
purpose
better
;
and
he
immediately
hasten
to
a
magistrate
inform
him
of
the
whole
affair
,
and
,
to
give
it
an
air
of
truth
,
state
that
he
himself
be
a
member
of
the
band
,
whose
conscience
have
force
him
to
betray
the
wicked
course
his
fraternity
be
pursue
.
<EOS>
this
information
of
course
be
of
the
most
startling
character
to
the
magistrate
—
who
believe
Bonardi
and
his
man
have
quit
the
country
some
three
year
before
—
and
instantly
make
out
warrant
,
he
send
off
and
have
the
two
man
on
the
boat
arrest
.
<EOS>
on
confront
them
with
John
,
one
of
them
become
much
alarmed
,
and
,
on
the
promise
of
a
pardon
,
immediately
corroborate
his
statement
.
<EOS>
—
the
affair
result
in
the
whole
matter
be
speedily
make
known
to
the
governor
,
who
promptly
order
two
company
of
militia
,
consist
of
over
a
hundred
man
,
several
of
whom
have
serve
in
the
late
war
,
to
act
as
a
posse
to
the
Sheriff
,
in
arrest
or
exterminate
the
outlaw
.
<EOS>
the
Sheriff
himself
be
a
man
of
extreme
measure
,
who
care
little
for
the
sacrifice
of
life
,
so
his
end
be
by
such
mean
accomplish
.
<EOS>
His
plan
be
,
to
have
the
boat
start
at
the
give
time
,
as
though
nothing
have
be
discover
,
and
,
with
his
posse
,
to
go
down
on
her
himself
;
that
ere
fully
in
sight
of
the
rendezvous
,
some
seventy
-
five
should
land
,
and
proceed
thence
on
foot
;
that
the
steamer
,
when
hail
,
should
round
to
,
but
manage
to
avoid
send
out
a
boat
—
<EOS>
well
judging
,
if
the
bandit
be
there
conceal
,
they
would
not
allow
their
scheme
to
be
frustrate
by
a
circumstance
so
trifling,—that
the
steam
should
be
compress
until
the
boat
come
along
side
,
so
that
the
steamer
may
start
suddenly
,
and
by
this
mean
throw
them
into
confusion
;
that
at
the
same
time
the
party
conceal
on
board
,
should
pour
among
them
a
well
direct
fire
,
which
be
also
to
be
a
signal
to
those
on
shore
to
be
ready
to
intercept
their
landing
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
attack
be
carry
out
exactly
as
plan
,
and
the
reader
have
already
see
the
result
.
<EOS>
the
grand
oversight
be
in
compress
the
steam
,
and
then
throw
it
suddenly
upon
the
engine
,
which
shortly
after
produce
the
terrible
explosion
we
have
record
.
<EOS>
have
thus
briefly
explain
the
matter
most
directly
connect
with
our
story
,
and
trust
the
reader
be
as
anxious
to
quit
this
scene
of
wholesale
slaughter
as
ourself
,
we
shall
,
after
give
a
slight
summary
of
what
follow
,
leave
it
at
once
and
forever
.
<EOS>
but
few
of
those
poor
being
on
board
the
ill
fate
steamer
at
the
time
of
her
explosion
,
be
save
;
and
these
mostly
by
the
aid
of
the
boat
,
which
have
be
bring
hither
by
the
order
of
Bonardi
,
for
a
very
different
purpose
.
<EOS>
some
two
or
three
of
the
number
who
leap
into
the
stream
,
swam
to
the
shore
—
the
rest
be
drown
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
an
hour
,
the
boat
burn
to
the
water
's
edge
and
sink
--
bear
down
with
her
the
gold
and
silver
coin
,
the
primary
cause
of
the
dire
mishap
and
loss
of
life

in
the
meantime
a

,
post

,
to
St.

which
result
in
the
arrival
,
some
three

later

of

<EOS>
this
,
ere
morning

bear
back
a
strange
medley

some
dying
,
some
dead
.
<EOS>
of
the
party
of
Bonardi

some
few

prisoner
;
but
these
,
generally

,
consist
of
those
who
be
too
severely
wound
to
fight
or
escape
,
and
who
afterwards
,
with
but
few
exception
,
die
of
their
wound

the
main

either

<EOS>
of

a
number

upon
those
who
hear

they
believe

Webber
,
contrary
to
his

custom
,
have
seem
almost
indifferent
to

merely
say
,
"
He
will

retire
early
to
rest

to
be
in

by
the
sudden

a
mournful
gleam

so
be
allow
the
expression

on
to
the
pale

calm

with
her
eye
fix
steadfastly
upon
him

sink
into
a
seat
by
his
side

seemingly
unconscious
of
everything
around

His

stand
and
gaze
upon
him
for
a
few
moment
with
fold
arm
,
while
his

writhe
in
agony

his

audibly

nearer

louder
come
the
rushing
sound

what
could
it

<EOS>
all
spring
to

although
it
be
dark

dash
over
the
hill
to
the
right

they
could
trace
the
dim
outline
of
a
horseman

follow
close

another

another

"There

breathless
haste

"The
<EOS>
next
moment

tremendous
crash

whole
house
tremble

all

break

while
a
tall

muscular

leap
forward

into

astonished

deep
voice

back

then
there
come
a
flash
—
a
crack

with
a
yell
of
pain

sink
to
the
floor

"How!—Barton

intruder

the
figure
seize
upon
the
body
of
John

with
the
strength
of
a
giant

,
turn
,
bound
into

around
the

forth

by
this
time
the
bandit

Bonardi

"Away

he

to
his

bury
his
own
spur
in
his
horse
's
flank

he
dart
off

<EOS>
Webber
instantly
draw
a
pistol
,
and
take
aim
as
well
as
the
darkness
would
permit
,
pull
the
trigger
.
<EOS>
a
flash
—
a
report
—
a
groan
succeed
—
and
he
could
perceive
Bonardi
waver
in
his
saddle
;
but
still
he
sit
his
horse
—
the
animal
slacken
not
his
speed
—
and
in
a
few
second
both
horse
and
rider
disappear
,
while
Webber
's
attention
be
suddenly
call
to
another
quarter
,
where
the
bandit
be
be
attack
by
another
party
of
horseman
that
have
just
come
up
.
<EOS>
from
the
flight
of
John
from
the
river
,
the
chase
have
be
a
desperate
,
and
an
equal
one
;
with
the
exception
,
that
in
the
hard
run
of
thirty
mile
,
the
bandit
have
succeed
in
distance
their
pursuer
some
quarter
of
a
mile
,
so
that
they
have
just
sufficient
time
,
after
John
enter
the
cottage
,
to
seize
upon
a
huge
stick
of
timber
,
break
open
the
door
,
capture
the
traitor
and
mount
,
before
the
other
be
upon
them

<EOS>
as
their
design
be
now
accomplish
,
they
turn
upon
their
pursuer
,
head
by
Piketon
—
for
Bonardi
still
keep
upon
his
course
—
and
a
terrible
fight
ensue
.
<EOS>
Webber
and
his
companion
not
know
friend
from
foe
,
retreat
into
the
house
,
to
be
ready
to
defend
it
in
case
of
necessity

<EOS>
"i

,
if

Webber

<EOS>
"
as
soon
as
this
fight

over

we
must

against
the

too

after
a
moment

pause

how
basely
I

I
can
scarcely
realize
my
having

more

for

past

notorious
bandit

"Well

He

I

"Who

We

<EOS>
""I
be
in

sad
condition

,
gloomily
;

for

I

you
be
most
welcome

we

endeavor

ere

,
to
increase
your
party

pursuit

<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
further
detail
seem
unnecessary
here
,
we
trust
the
reader
will
allow
us
to
substitute
a
brief
summary
of
what
follow
.
<EOS>
the
party
in
question
remain
at
Webber
's
through
the
night
—
all
rest
,
with
the
exception
of
the
wound
,
in
the
out
-
house
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
care
for
,
as
well
as
circumstance
would
permit
,
and
their
wound
not
be
of
a
very
serious
nature
,
they
depart
the
next
morning
for
St.
Louis
,
bear
their
two
dead
comrade
with
them
.
<EOS>
during
the
night
a
search
be
make
,
in
the
direction
take
by
Bonardi
,
for
the
body
of
John
;
it
be
think
probable
,
the
former
,
if
wound
,
may
drop
him
on
the
way
,
and
possibly
with
life
remain
--
though
for
the
latter
there
be
little
hope;—but
the
expedition
prove
fruitless
,
and
the
party
return
some
three
hour
later
,
not
have
discover
the
least
trace
.
<EOS>
Merton
,
anxious
to
start
early
on
the
morrow
to
the
rescue
of
her
he
love
,
ride
most
of
the
night
from
farm
to
farm
,
among
the
settler
,
give
each
a
brief
account
of
what
have
happen
,
and
beseech
them
to
join
in
rid
the
country
of
the
outlaw
;
the
result
of
which
be
,
the
additional
force
of
some
twenty
-
five
,
able
bodied
,
determined
man
,
well
mount
and
armed
,
who
,
with
the
party
at
Webber
's
,
set
out
at
daylight
on
a
journey
to
the
Osage
,
to
search
for
the
grand
rendezvous
,
apprehend
,
disperse
,
or
annihilate
the
bandit
.
<EOS>
in
this
expedition
,
Webber
and
Tyrone
do
not
join
;
the
former
,
because
he
do
not
consider
it
prudent
to
leave
his
house
in
a
totally
unguarded
state
,
with
the
corpse
of
his
son
within
,
and
his
wife
in
a
very
feeble
condition
,
but
little
well
than
a
stupid
insanity
,
cause
from
her
overwhelming
grief
;
and
the
latter
,
because
it
be
deem
advisable
that
one
at
least
should
remain
as
a
companion
for
the
former
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
Webber
have
learn
,
in
course
of
conversation
with
the
officer
mention
,
the
astounding
particular
of
what
have
occur
at
the
river
,
and
the
cause
of
hate
against
his
son
,
from
his
have
be
a
member
and
betray
the
band
,
the
which
have
serve
to
completely
unnerve
,
and
almost
render
him
insane
also
.
<EOS>
besides
Webber
,
his
wife
and
Tyrone
,
there
be
another
individual
within
that
house
of
mourning
,
whom
we
have
,
during
the
excitement
of
the
past
few
day
,
lose
sight
of
altogether
;
but
whom
we
shall
bring
once
more
before
the
reader
,
ere
<EOS>
we
close
our
now
nearly
complete
story
.
<EOS>
—
We
allude
to
the
prisoner
of
the
Jew
,
who
,
under
the
treatment
he
have
of
late
receive
,
be
fast
regain
health
and
strength
.
<EOS>
but
leave
each
and
all
for

precede
the
party
just
depart

and

second
from
the
departure
of
Bonardi
,
<EOS>
a
rough
group
of
some
fifteen
outlaw
be
lounge
about
the
Outer
Cave
—
some
talking
,
some
polish
their
weapon
,
and
some
playing
card
.
<EOS>
these
consist
of
the
ten
leave
as
guard
,
with
the
addition
of
Hendrick
and
his
four
companion
,
who
return
the
day
previous
,
bring
in
Saxton
and
Niles
prisoner
,
both
of
whom
be
now
confine
in
the
dungeon
below
,
the
place
whence
Piketon
lead
forth
the
Jew
on
the
night
of
his
trial
and
execution
.
<EOS>
in
the
Inner
Cave
be
four
female
—
consist
of
Emily
,
Inez
,
Hetty
and
Cyntha
;
and
to
these
we
shall
,
for
the
present
,
direct
our
attention
.
<EOS>
Inez
and
Emily
,
at
the
moment
introduce
,
be
recline
on
sofa
,
but
a
little
distance
apart
,
while
the
other
two
,
Hetty
and
Cyntha
,
be
occupy
one
corner
of
the
apartment
,
converse
together
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
since
the
departure
of
Ronald
,
Inez
have
lavish
upon
Emily
the
most
tender
care
,
anticipate
her
every
wish
,
and
do
all
in
her
power
to
restore
her
strength
,
and
contribute
to
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
partly
from
Ronald
,
ere
his
departure
,
and
afterwards
from
Hetty
and
Emily
herself
,
she
have
learn
the
story
of
the
wrong
of
the
latter
,
and
all
the
gentle
sympathy
of
the
woman
have
be
elicit
in
her
behalf
.
<EOS>
from
Ronald
,
too
,
she
have
learn
a
secret
,
of
which
Emily
and
Hetty
be
as
yet
ignorant
,
accompany
by
a
request
that
she
would
not
reveal
it
,
unless
some
unforeseen
accident
should
prevent
his
return
.
<EOS>
the
parting
between
Ronald
and
Inez
have
be
affect
and
solemn
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
reveal
to
Inez
his
design
,
but
she
could
perceive
by
his
pale
feature
,
and
an
agitation
which
he
vainly
strove
to
conceal
,
that
he
be
about
set
forth
on
an
unusual
,
if
not
dangerous
mission
.
<EOS>
hence
,
as
we
have
say
,
the
parting
have
be
affect
and
solemn
;
and
since
that
time
,
Inez
,
although
she
strove
to
be
cheerful
,
and
pay
the
most
tender
regard
to
the
want
of
Emily
,
could
not
banish
from
<EOS>
her
mind
thought
dark
and
painful
;
and
in
consequence
an
air
of
gloomy
abstraction
would
not
unfrequently
take
possession
of
her
.
<EOS>
on
the
day
we
again
introduce
her
,
these
painful
reverie
have
become
more
frequent
than
before
—
more
prolonged
—
and
in
one
of
them
we
now
find
her
.
<EOS>
and
here
,
have
we
space
to
devote
it
,
we
may
moralize
upon
the
cause
produce
these
result
.
<EOS>
It
be
think
the
spirit
,
in
many
case
,
when
approach
the
confine
of
that
vast
eternity
before
it
,
grow
bright
,
more
etherial
,
and
be
less
allied
to
the
corporeal
substance
around
it
—
consequently
,
be
more
sensitive
to
event
about
to
happen
--
and
by
its
elevation
or
depression
,
prognosticate
,
many
time
,
the
good
or
evil
that
will
shortly
follow
:
moreover
,
too
,
that
with
an
intuitive
sense
,
it
sometimes
communicate
to
the
body
<EOS>
what
and
whom
this
good
or
evil
will
effect
,
and
what
will
be
the
result
.
<EOS>
hence
the
spiritual
,
or
second
sight
.
<EOS>
We
believe
,
too
,
the
spirit
be
not
unfrequently
act
upon
,
when
far
from
death
ourselves
,
with
regard
to
the
fate
of
some
dearly
beloved
friend
,
(
but
not
so
clearly
as
in
the
former
instance
)
which
be
to
influence
our
seem
destiny
;
and
hence
our
gloomy
foreboding
,
or
presentiment
.
<EOS>
but
as
we
presume
the
reader
—
who
be
doubtless
anxious
for
the
conclusion
of
our
story
—
will
not
thank
us
for
stop
to
moralize
or
philosophize
here
,
we
shall
pass
on
,
and
leave
a
subject
we
may
otherwise
be
tempt
to
investigate
farther
.
<EOS>
inez
,
as
we
have
say
,
be
recline
on
a
sofa
,
in
a
mood
of
gloomy
abstraction
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
bent
upon
the
ground
,
her
feature
be
pale
and
very
sad
in
expression
,
and
there
be
a
slight
quiver
of
some
of
the
delicate
muscle
,
as
though
the
mind
be
labor
with
painful
thought
.
<EOS>
—
She
have
be
sit
thus
some
quarter
of
an
hour
,
motionless
and
mute
.
<EOS>
Emily
be
also
recline
upon
a
sofa
,
but
a
little
distance
from
her
.
<EOS>
Her
feature
,
too
,
be
pale
,
and
somewhat
care
-
wear
;
but
there
be
,
notwithstanding
,
a
more
animated
and
hopeful
look
than
when
we
see
her
last
—
and
yet
,
withal
,
the
expression
be
sad
.
<EOS>
under
the
kind
treatment
receive
from
Inez
,
Emily
have
gradually
recover
from
the
hardship
she
have
undergo
,
and
although
still
weak
,
be
fast
regain
health
and
strength
.
<EOS>
at
the
moment
introduce
,
her
eye
be
rest
enquiringly
,
but
sadly
,
upon
Inez
,
as
though
she
sympathize
with
,
and
wish
,
yet
almost
fear
to
question
her
of
her
sorrow
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
strong
prompting
of
her
gentle
and
grateful
heart
get
the
well
of
her
reserve
,
and
approach
,
she
bend
down
,
and
gently
take
the
soft
,
delicate
hand
of
Inez
in
her
own
,
in
a
sweet
,
touching
,
musical
voice
,
she
said:"you
be
sad
,
dear
<EOS>
inez?"there
be
word
,
and
way
of
say
them
,
which
at
time
,
with
a
sudden
and
resistless
impulse
,
will
stir
up
all
the
fine
emotion
of
the
heart
,
and
make
the
eye
grow
moist
and
dim
.
<EOS>
—
such
be
the
effect
of
Emily
's
word
upon
Inez
.
<EOS>
She
start
,
a
flush
mantle
her
pale
feature
,
and
she
look
up
into
the
sweet
countenance
of
Emily
,
with
tearful
eye
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
these
two
gentle
being
be
lock
in
each
other
's
embrace
,
and
the
tear
of
both
mingle
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
will
you
not
open
your
heart
,
dear
Inez
,
and
tell
me
what
make
you
so
sorrowful
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Emily
,
as
,
with
an
arm
throw
around
the
other
waist
,
she
seat
herself
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
"I
hardly
know
myself
,
Emily
,
"
answer
Inez
,
with
a
sigh
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
feel
as
though
there
be
a
weight
upon
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
fear
something
have
happen
to
him
--
to
Ronald
--
though
why
I
can
not
tell
;
for
he
have
often
be
away
,
sometimes
for
a
week
,
and
yet
I
feel
not
so
depressed
as
now
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
dark
man
you
speak
of
will
betray
him
,
perhaps
have
do
so
already
,
and
he
may
now
be
in
prison
,
or
dead
.
<EOS>
oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
if
such
should
be
the
case
,
what
,
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
would
become
of
me
?
"
<EOS>
and
Inez
shudder
,
and
hide
her
face
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"Do
not
borrow
trouble
,
dear
Inez
,
"
say
Emily
,
gently
,
and
soothingly
.
<EOS>
"
all
will
turn
out
for
the
good
,
rest

<EOS>
We
be
all
in
the
hand
of
a
holy
,
omnipresent
God

whose
action
can
not
err

<EOS>
""But
be
not
that
God
a
God
of
justice
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Inez
,
solemnly
.
"
<EOS>
and
will
he
not
punish
man
for
his
misdeed
,
his
—

—

voice
falter
—
"
his
crimes?""man
will
doubtless
suffer
for
his
misdoing

"
answer
emily
;
"
but
God
will
look
into
the
heart
and
judge
him
by
the
motive
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
Emily
,
dear
Emily
,
"
return
Inez
,
weeping
,
"
to
you
I
will
say
what
I
have
never
yet
say
to
human
being
—
for
you
seem
so
gentle
and
pure
,
my
heart
yearn
for
your
sympathy
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
occupation
of
my
husband
,
and
that
it
be
criminal
in
the
eye
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
His
heart
be
good
and
noble
;
and
yet
,
for
his
outward
act
,
I
have
a
long
time
fear
,
and
of
late
more
than
ever
,
that
some
terrible
calamity
,
sooner
or
later
,
will
befal
him
.
<EOS>
""It
be
strange
,
"
reply
Emily
,
musingly
,
"
that
one
who
possess
so
many
good
and
generous
quality
as
he
,
should
lead
such
a
wild
,
daring
life
—
should
associate
with
man
so
far
inferior
to
himself
,
both
in
intellect
and
education
.
<EOS>
""Yet
<EOS>
judge
him
<EOS>
not
too
harshly
,
dear
Emily
,
"
return
Inez
,
sorrowfully
,
"
for
circumstance
have
make
him
what
he
be
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
me
his
early
history
;
how
he
weep
over
the
death
of
a
beloved
mother
—
a
mother
who
be
foully
,
most
foully
wronged;—how
your
—
how
his
own
father
disown
,
treat
him
with
contempt
,
and
spurn
him
from
his
presence
,
while
society
could
do
nought
less
than
point
at
him
with
the
finger
of
shame
,
because
he
be
a
bastard
son
.
<EOS>
oh
,
you
know
not
how
such
thing
can
try
a
proud
,
restless
spirit
like
his
—
a
spirit
that
,
turn
into
a
different
channel
,
have
lead
him
to
honor
and
renown
—
and
make
him
turn
with
venomed
tooth
upon
that
society
,
as
the
viper
upon
the
foot
that
trample
it
.
<EOS>
""i
<EOS>
doubt
not
there
have
be
strong
cause
for
his
deed
,
"
rejoin
emily
;
"
yet
methink
a
nature
like
his
should
have
pause
,
ere
he
bring
one
so
gentle
and
innocent
as
you
seem
to
be
,
into
a
career
the
law
of
the
land
will
hold
most
criminal

<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
him
wrong
there
,
dear
Emily

<EOS>
It
be
of
my

doing

<EOS>
He
frankly
and
nobly
tell
me
all
;
that
we
must
never
meet
again
;
and
yet
I
marry
him
,
and
give
up
name

know
him
to
be
an
outlaw

<EOS>
""this

very
strange

Emily
,
in
surprise

<EOS>
"Does
<EOS>
it
seem
strange

you?—to
me

<EOS>
I
love
him
;

have
it
be
to
the
gallow

<EOS>
what

give
up
this
wild

terrible

the

of

Osage

so
call
from
its

<EOS>
the
only
point
whence
<EOS>
the

could
be
approach
.
<EOS>
on
either
hand
be
a
high
bluff
,
which
give
the
channel
run
back
to
the

an
appearance
of

artificial

<EOS>
the
bluff
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
Osage

and
immediately
around
the
Entrance
,
be
very
steep
and
rocky
,
cover
with
a
stunted
growth
of
tree
and
underbrush
,
so
that
a
large
party
may
be
there
conceal
in

It

here
that
Emily

the
two
female

be
land
,
and
then
immediately
conduct
up
the
steep
.
<EOS>
as
she
go
up
the
winding
path
,
she
could
occasionally
perceive
,
on
either
hand
,
a
dark
figure
,
crouch
in
the
bush
,
with
a
rifle
either
rest
against
his
shoulder
,
or
poise
and
point
toward
the
river
,
whom
she
rightly
conjecture
to
be
of
Bonardi
's
band
,
and
that
—
but
why
she
know
not
—
they
expect
an
attack
from
below
.
<EOS>
when
she
reach
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
she
could
perceive
the
sun
shine
upon
a
beautiful
and
variegated
landscape
,
through
a
crimson
mellow
haze
,
within
an
hour
of
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
—
at
another
time
perhaps
,
she
would
have
pause
to
admire
the
scenery
,
and
contemplate
the
rich
beauty
of
light
and
shade
,
as

strike
some
high
point

with
a
golden
sheen
,
the
ray
of

throw
a
long
line
of
shadow
into
the
quiet
valley
at
its

glance
off
from
the
smooth
surface
of
many
a
stream
—
not
except
the
Osage
,
and
the
great
Missouri
,
the
latter
some
several
mile
distant
—
as
from
a
polished
mirror
;
but
now
her
thought
be
sad
and
painful
;
and
she
turn
from
this
to
her
conductor
—
who
here
come
to
a
halt
,
and
be
look
eagerly
in
every
direction

with
an
enquire
gaze

up
the

some
three

It

ere

two

<EOS>
from

it

gather

the
outlaw

who
may
chance
to
escape
the
attack
on
the
Mississippi

would
here
rally
as
their
stronghold
,

doubtless
here
make
their
last
desperate
<EOS>
resistance,—particularly
Bonardi
,
who
,
he
state
,
would
return
hither
to
seek
his
wife
,
and
,
from
his
character
,
be
little
likely
to
fly,—consequently
this
be
the
place

to
give
the
final
blow
of
extermination
to
the

<EOS>
on

information
the
authority

hence
the
arrival
of

purpose

as
soon
as

"Six

his
grief
in
choke
sobs

<EOS>
Suffice
,
that
a
hard
day
's
ride
of
bodily
fatigue
and
mental
anxiety
,
have
bring
him
to
the
spot
where
we
now
find
him
.
<EOS>
when
within
three
mile
of
the
place
,
Edward
have
descry
the
steamer
;
and
divine
at
once
her
purpose
,
have
become
very
much
alarm
,
lest
there
should
be
a
fight
,
wherein
,
as
he
think
,
Emily
must
necessarily
become
involved
.
<EOS>
whisper
his
fear
to
his
companion
Bernard
,
both
instantly
drive
their
spur
into
their
horse
'
side
,
and
set
rapidly
forward
,
in
advance
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
whereon
they
now
stand
,
they
find
it
too
steep
for
a
speedy
ascent
with
their
horse
,
which
be
already
very
much
blow
,
and
leap
from
their
back
,
they
dart
up
on
foot
.
<EOS>
They
have
proceed
but
<EOS>
a
few
pace
,
when
they
hear
the
report
of
a
volley
of
fire
-
arm
,
which
cause
them
to
redouble
their
speed
.
<EOS>
on
their
way
,
they
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
fly
bandit
,
some
distance
to
the
left
;
but
heed
them
not
,
they
still
press
on
,
and
at
length
,
pale
with
excitement
,
and
breathless
with
bodily
exertion
,
they
reach
the
summit
.
<EOS>
as
they
come
in
full
view
of
the
steamer
,
the
awful
explosion
at
the
cave
take
place
;
and
Edward
,
think
Emily
be
within
,
and
now
lose
to
him
for
ever
,
utter
the
word
record
,
and
sink
to
the
earth
.
<EOS>
as
to
Emily
herself
,
she
have
ride
,
in
company
with
Hetty
and
Cyntha
,
some
two
mile
,
when
she
perceive
a
body
of
man
,
about
a
mile
to
the
right
of
her
,
rapidly
advance
toward
the
spot
she
have
but
lately
quit
,
and
where
she
know
the
bandit
be
lie
in
ambush
.
<EOS>
some
little
distance
in
advance
of
the
main
body
,
she
descry
two
horseman
,
whom
her
eye
and
heart
at
once
tell
her
be
Edward
and
Bernard
,
Fearful
lest
the
one
she
love
,
with
his
compan
ion
,
may
heedlessly
run
into
an
ambush
,
that
would
cost
both
of
them
their
life
,
she
suddenly
wheel
her
animal
,
and
,
without
a
word
to
the
other
,
dart
away
to
intercept
them
.
<EOS>
but
in
lay
out
her
line
of
interception
,
the
angle
be
too
abruptly
form
,
and
,
in
consequence
,
she
have
fall
somewhat
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
have
they
even
for
a
moment
glance
to
the
right
,
they
must
have
see
her
;
but
with
their
eye
intent
upon
one
point
,
she
have
escape
their
observation
.
<EOS>
when
they
spring
from
their
horse
,
at
the
base
of
the
hill
,
she
be
but
a
few
rod
distant
.
<EOS>
Ere
they
arrive
half
way
to
the
summit
,
she
have
dismount
and
be
struggle
up
after
them
,
but
too
much
exhausted
to
gain
their
ear
with
her
voice
.
<EOS>
Their
meeting
the
reader
have
already
see
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
leave
Edward
and
Emily
to
the
holy
commune
of
love
,
and
the
relation
of
such
other
matter
as
be
already
familiar
to
the
reader
,
with
a
few
brief
remark
we
shall
close
this
chapter
.
<EOS>
the
party
of
which
Merton
and
Bernard
form
a
portion
,
on
see
them
ride
forward
in
such
haste
,
increase
their
speed
,
and
presently
join
them
on
the
hill
,
where
they
receive
the
sad
intelligence
of
what
have
take
place
,
and
also
learn
that
the
bandit
have
effect
their
escape
,
without
the
loss
of
a
man
of
those
who
be
in
the
cave
at
the
time
of
the
explosion
,
not
one
could
be
recognise
—
so
mangled
be
they
,
and
tear
,
and
blacken
with
powder
.
<EOS>
the
cave
itself
,
though
not
utterly
demolish
,
be
so
rent
and
shatter
—
both
apartment
be
blow
into
one
—
that
those
who
may
chance
to
view
it
at
the
present
day
,
will
fail
,
doubtless
,
to
recognise
that
almost
classic
beauty
belong
to
it
prior
to
and
at
the
date
of
our
story
;
or
,
what
be
more
,
may
even
fail
to
recognise
the
cave
at
all
.
<EOS>
for
the
benefit
of
the
curious
,
however
,
and
lest
some
may
deem
it
a
fabulous
one
,
we
will
here
assert
that
the
cave
be
still
in
existence
,
and
can
be
see
by
those
who
may
be
dispose
to
seek
it
.
<EOS>
as
the
party
just
arrive
soon
discover
their
presence
be
no
longer
necessary
,
and
as
the
sun
be
already
near
the
line
of
the
western
horizon
,
they
immediately
set
out
upon
their
return
,
accompany
by
Bernard
,
Edward
and
Emily
.
<EOS>
Hetty
and
Cyntha
soon
after
join
them
,
both
of
whom
,
to
their
no
small
surprise
and
terror
,
be
immediately
take
into
custody
,
to
be
convey
to
St.
Louis
for
examination
;
and
particularly
the
latter
,
who
have
no
paper
to
show
that
she
be
free
.
<EOS>
about
five
mile
from
the
Osage
,
the
party
find
a
convenient
place
,
and
quarter
for
the
night
,
during
which
Cyntha
effect
her
escape
,
and
be
never
afterwards
hear
from,—she
probably
have
again
join
the
escape
outlaw
.
<EOS>
at
daylight
on
the
follow
morning
,
each
resume
their
journey
,
much
refresh
by
a
good
night
's
rest
,
and
for
some
thirty
mile
travel
in
company
,
when
they
gradually
begin
to
separate
,
as
here
and
there
one
after
another
turn
off
to
seek
their
near
course
home
.
<EOS>
some
three
hour
after
nightfall
,
Bernard
,
Edward
and
Emily
arrive
at
Webber
's
,
have
travel
the
last
five
mile
entirely
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
party
on
the
steamer
remain
at
the
cave
during
the
night
,
and
on
the
day
follow
,
after
have
inter
the
remain
of
all
those
find
in
the
cave
,
start
upon
their
return
,
with
what
feeling
<EOS>
we
leave
the
reader
to
imagine
.
<EOS>
of
the
party
of
Piketon
,
we
can
only
say
they
be
never
again
hear
of
in
that
country
.
<EOS>
—
what
become
of
them
be
unknown
.
<EOS>
probably
they
seek
some
remote
place
,
and
perhaps
settle
down
,
many
of
them
,
into
peaceable
citizen
—
who
shall
say
?
<EOS>
no
little
wonderment
be
create
among
some
of
the
old
settler
,
to
find
that
here
and
there
an
old
neighbor
have
suddenly
and
mysteriously
disappear
—
in
many
case
whole
family
also
—
and
for
a
long
time
it
be
a
difficult
matter
to
reconcile
their
mind
to
the
fact
,
that
in
the
person
of
those
neighbor
have
exist
many
of
the
most
formidable
member
of
the
dread
bandit
.
<EOS>
on
the
night
follow
the
one
in
which
Bonardi
blow
up
the
cave
—
wherein
Saxton
and
Niles
perish
—
in
a
miserable
hoved
,
unfriended
and
alone
,
the
wretched
outcast
Curdish
breathe
his
last
.
<EOS>
the
wound
in
his
shoulder
,
give
by
Bernard
,
have
mortify
,
produce
his
death
.
<EOS>
so
perish
the
guilty
.
<EOS>
thus
,
one
after
one
,
in
various
way
,
have
we
see
our
character
disappear
,
until
but
a
few
remain
.
<EOS>
well
,
like
to
them
,
one
after
one
,
shall
we
also
disappear
,
and
perchance
without
a
friendly
hand
be
raise
to
record
that
we
have
be
.
<EOS>
let
us
now
turn
once
more
to
the
living
of
our
drama
of
life
,
take
a
farewell
view
,
and
then
let
the
curtain
descend
and
shut
them
from
our
sight
forever
.

chapter
v.the

the
MYSTERY
unravelled
—
the
LETTER
—
the
FINALE.It
be
a
beautiful
morning
,
about
a
week
from
the
return
of
Emily
,
and
every
thing
in
nature
look
bright
and
animated
.
<EOS>
a
gentle
rain
have
fall
during
the
night
,
and
the
drop
be
still
linger
on
leaf
and
blade
and
flower
,
and
sparkle
in
the
morning
sunlight
,
like
so
many
diamond
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
clear
,
soft
and
invigorating
;
and
the
light

footed
Zephyrs
sigh
through
the
forest
,
rustle
the
leave
,
kiss
the
beautiful
flower
,
and
catch
a
thousand
sweet
sound
of
melody
to
bear
away
to
their
frolicsome
meeting
in
Fairy
Land
.
<EOS>
before
Webber
's
cottage
,
on
the
morning
in
question
,
stand
a
gallant
steed
,
foam
and
pant
from
hard
riding
;
while
the
rider
himself
,
have
enter
the
cottage
,
be
now
stand
in
the
apartment
where
the
gentle
Rufus
have
breathe
his
last
,
with
one
arm
throw
lightly
around
the
waist
of
the
graceful
Emily
Nevance
,
who
,
with
her
soft
blue
eye
turn
sweetly
upon
him
,
be
gaze
with
a
look
of
joy
,
somewhat
sadden
by
grief
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
Edward
<EOS>
,
"
she
exclaim
,
with
animation
,
"
I
joy
that
you
have
come
!
<EOS>
I
have
be
watch
for
you
since
the
first
streak
of
morning
gild
the
east
;
for
I
know
you
would
select
the
cool
of
the
day
,
and
ride
long
ere
daylight
.
<EOS>
oh
,
I
have
be
so
sad
since
we
bury
poor
Rufus
!
"
<EOS>
and
Emily
turn
away
her
head
to
conceal
a
tear
.
<EOS>
"well
,
well
,
dear
<EOS>
,
"
answer
Edward
,
draw
her
fondly
to
him
,
and
press
a
kiss
upon
her
lip
,
"
let
us
not
forget
,
while
we
grieve
,
that
Rufus
be
happy
now
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fact
that
we
be
prone
to
grieve
too
much
for
depart
friend
,
and
thereby
oppose
our
selfishness
to
the
Divine
Will
.
<EOS>
instead
of
grieve
for
the
death
of
a
friend
,
we
should
rather
rejoice
that
all
his
trouble
be
at
an
end
,
and
that
he
be
now
singe
immortal
song
in
the
bright
region
of
glory
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
all
must
die
,
sooner
or
late
—
that
we
be
all
wend
to
the
Spirit
Land
<EOS>
—
then
wherefore
grieve
that
one
we
love
have
reach
the
bright
goal
before
us?""I
admit
your
philosophy
be
good
,
"
rejoin
emily
,
"
but
still
you
will
allow
philosophy
have
but
little
to
do
with
the
heart
,
with
the
affection
.
<EOS>
philosophy
be
the
cold
emanation
of
the
brain
—
love
the
warm
offspring
of
the
heart
;
and
the
latter
,
as
a
general
thing
,
will
triumph
over
the
former
.
<EOS>
""your
<EOS>
remark
be
true
,
"
return
Edward
,
"
for
such
be
the
selfish
propensity
of
human
nature

<EOS>
the
heart
will
for
a
time
gain
ascendency
over
the
head
<EOS>
:
love
will
triumph
over
philosophy
:
<EOS>
such
be
fact
;
and
yet
,
as
I
say
before
,
we
should
strive
to
give
the
latter
the
asceudency
,
when
we
find
the
former
can
avail
us
nothing
.
<EOS>
—
to
this
end
I
would
fain
bring
philosophy
to
my
aid
here
;
and
yet
withal
I
deeply
,
most
deeply
grieve
,
that
one
so
gentle
,
so
noble
as
Rufus
,
should
be
take
from
among
us
,
just
in
the
bright
flower
of
manhood

<EOS>
for
himself
I
deeply
grieve
,

for
his
almost
heart

break
parent

my
heart
bleed
in
sympathy

and
Edward

voice
tremble
,
and
tear
fill
his

<EOS>
"Alas

<EOS>
"
sigh
emily

"
his
mother
,
poor

I
fear
will
never

""Is

"he

more
worthily

not
only
to
the
elevation

of
those
around

<EOS>
no

,
dear
Emily
,
should
set
their
heart
upon
gold
.
<EOS>
man
have
noble
duty
to
perform

the
hoarding
of
wealth
.
<EOS>
wealth
,
properly
use
<EOS>
,
I
will
admit
be
a
blessing
,
because
by
it
so
many
poor
human
being
can
be
make
comfortable
and
happy
;
and
yet
how
few
of
the
wealthy
think
of
this
,
or
act
upon
it
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
use
their
gold
to
oppress
,
to
grind
the
face
of
those
who
be
dependent
upon
them
,
and
by
such
mean
make
their
wealth
a
curse
.
<EOS>
""Too

true

Emily

musingly

then
look
up
into

with
a
sweet
expression

add
:

<EOS>
those
of
the

thin
and
pale

exhibit
nothing

that
ghastliness
so
apparent
on

his
countenance

naturally
stern

and
there
be
a
few
line
in
it
of
a
sinister
cast

<EOS>
He
appear
like

find
myself
a
beggar

a
vagabond

and
a
villain

in

<EOS>
this

no

the
murder
of
the
only
daughter
of
Sir

for
which
I

in

"At

<EOS>
I

I

<EOS>
I
take
passage

fifteen

<EOS>
I

in

""After

Walton

I
come
to
the
West
,
and
for
ten
year
lead
a
dissolute
life

<EOS>
My
conscience
,
meantime
,
often
upbraid
me
for
the
crime
I
have
be
guilty
of
,
and
at
length
I
resolve
to
make
at

some
slight
reparation

<EOS>
My
money
be
now
nearly
exhaust

still
I
have
some

thousand

remain

I
return
to
the
East
,
with
the
intent
of
seek
Emily
,
proceed
to
England
,
and
restore
her
to
her
right

for
I
have
learn
,
withal

that
her

be
all
dead

employ

for

I

I
employ
a

up

again

return
to

four
year
follow

squander

make
way

at

fearful

death
may
overtake
me

ere
<EOS>
the
grand
error

should

seek
a
magistrate

in
Cincinnati

have
paper
draw
up

state

aloud

follows:"dear

the
liberty
I
take
in
thus
address
you

for
it

perhaps
the
only
favor
I
shall
ever
ask
at

of
one

the

consanguinity
bid
me
hold

<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
see
you
start
with
surprise

at
the
idea
of
the

blood
flow
in
the
vein
of
both
of
us

<EOS>
such
be
the
fact

<EOS>
Your

mine
be

but
fortune
place
a
wide
disparity
between
us

<EOS>
You
be
bear

<EOS>
I
to
poverty

disgrace

<EOS>
You
be
bear
to
be
the

of

I
to
be
the
outcast

<EOS>
and
if
we
both

what

you
ask

make
this
disparity

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
you

<EOS>
I
be
wander
from
my

<EOS>
my
thought
be
almost
distract
,
and
so
pardon
me
.
<EOS>
"some
day
since
,
in
a
conversation
with
the
father
of
John
,
I
learn
of
you
,
and
that
your
birth
be
involve
in
mystery
.
<EOS>
have
learn
the
whole
particular
,
and
some
slight
coincidence
recur
to
my
mind
,
a
vague
suspicion
cross
me
that
you
may
be
the
daughter
of
Sir
Walter
Langdon,—who
<EOS>
,
if
living
,
must
be
of
the
same
age
with
yourself
;
and
who
,
fifteen
year
ago
—
about
the
period
when
you
be
bring
to
Webber's
—
mysteriously
disappear
.
<EOS>
"when
<EOS>
I
see
you
first
,
in
that
wild
retreat
on
the
mountain
of
the
Osage
,
I
feel
my
suspicion
at
once
make
reality
,
from
your
strong
resemblance
to
your
father
.
<EOS>
god
!
<EOS>
Emily
,
what
feeling
come
over
me
then
!
<EOS>
when
I
think
how
that
father
have
spurn
me
,
his
own
son
,
from
his
presence
,
and
be
thus
the
indirect
instrument
in
make
me
the
outlaw
I
be
!
<EOS>
but
a
terrible
retribution
follow
,
Emily
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
soon
after
die
—
your
brother
be
murder
—
you
be
steal
away
,
and
your
father
and
mine
die
a
childless
maniac
,
and
his
estate
pass
into
the
hand
of
a
villain
.
<EOS>
by
those
paper
destroy
by
John
,
doubtless
you
may
have
prove
your
identity
,
and
gain
possession
of
what
be
lawfully
your
own
.
<EOS>
as
matter
be
now
,
I
fear
this
can
not
be
do
—
still
I
think
it
worth
the
trial
;
but
,
at
least
,
you
may
rest
assure
your
birth
be
noble
and
honorable
;
and
this
,
to
one
as
sensitive
as
yourself
on
the
subject
,
can
not
but
be
joyful
tiding
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
dear
Emily
,
my
sister
,
I
must
bid
you
farewell,—for
time
press
,
and
my
wound
grow
painful
.
<EOS>
I
write
this
a
few
mile
from
the
cave
,
which
I
shall
endeavor
to
reach
alive
,
and
see
my
own
love
Inez
once
again
.
<EOS>
if
I
succeed
,
I
shall
probably
hand
you
this
myself,—if
<EOS>
not
,
you
will
get
it
from
the
hand
of
another
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
thing
of
which
I
wish
to
speak
with
you,—but
<EOS>
it
be
now
too
late
,
too
late
.
<EOS>
You
will
doubtless
hear
my
name
a
by
-
word
of
terror
,
and
my
memory
curse
;
but
you
at
least
will
be
char
itable
and
not
curse
me
;
you
at
least
will
take
into
consideration
the
circumstance
that
have
make
me
what
I
be
;
you
at
least
may
feel
the
poor
despised
outlaw
be
not
so
bad
as
he
seem
.
<EOS>
if
you
never
behold
me
again
,
and
Inez
survive
the
loss
,
I
pray
you
,
<EOS>
dear
Emily
,
be
to
her
a
friend
and
sister

for
she
at

be
innocent
