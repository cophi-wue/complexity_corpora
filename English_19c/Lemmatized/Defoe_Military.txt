@@@twas

Musas

truly
I
have
reason
to
blush

when
I
consider
the
small
Advantage
I
have
reap'd
from
that
Change

<EOS>
but
lest
it

I
have
write

They

<EOS>
the

Affairs

noble
Expedition

<EOS>
when
the
force
under
his

's
Command
be

near
Barcelona
,
the
Siege
of
that
place
be
think
by
several
impracticable
,
not
only
for
want
of
experienc'd
Engineers
,
but
that
the
Besieged
be

those
difficulty

him
the

Sail
from

Nore
about
the
beginning
of
May
,
in

to
join

French
Fleet
,
then
at
Anchor
in
St.
Hellen
's
Road
,
under
the
Command
of
the
Count
de
Estree
.
<EOS>
but
in
execute
this
design
we
have
a
very
narrow
escape
:
for
De
Ruyter
,
the
Admiral
of
the
Dutch
Fleet
,
have
Notice
of
our
Intentions
,
wait
to
have
intercept
us
at
the
Mouth
of
the
River
,
but
by
the
assistance
of
a
great
fog
we
<EOS>
pass'd
Dover
before
he
be
aware
of
it
;
and
thus
he
miscarry
,
with
the
poor
advantage
of
take
only
one
small
Tender
.
  
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
after
the
joining
of
the
English
and
French
,
we
sail
directly
towards
the
Dutch
Coast
,
where
we
soon
get
sight
of
their
Fleet
;
a
sand
call
the
Galloper
lie
between
.
<EOS>
the
Dutch
seem'd
willing
there
to
expect
an
attack
from
us
:
<EOS>
but
in
regard
the
Charles
Man
of
War
have
be
lose
on
those
sand
the
War
before
;
and
that
our
ship
draw
more
water
than
those
of
the
Enemy
,
an
Engagement
may
be
render'd
<EOS>
very
disadvantageous
;
it
be
resolv'd
in
a
Council
of
War
to
avoid
come
to
a
battle
for
the
present
,
and
to
sail
direftly
for
Solebay
,
which
be
accordingly
put
in
execution
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
not
be
in
Solebay
above
four
or
five
day
,
when
De
Ruyter
,
hearing
of
it
,
make
his
Signal
for
sailing
in
order
to
surprize
us
;
and
he
have
certainly
have
his
Aim
,
have
there
be
any
Breeze
of
wind
to
favour
him
.
<EOS>
but
though
they
make
use
of
all
their
Sails
,
there
be
so
little
air
stirring
,
that
we
could
see
their
Fleet
make
towards
us
long
before
they
come
up
;
<EOS>
notwithstanding
which
,
our
Admirals
find
difficulty
enough
to
form
their
ship
into
a
line
of
Battle
,
so
as
to
be
ready
to
receive
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
about
four
in

Morning
of
the
28th
of
May
,
be
Tuesday
in
Whitson
Week
,
when
we
first
make

Discovery
;
and
about
eight
the
same
morning
the
Blue
Squadron
,
under
the
Command
of
the
Earl
of
Sandwich
,
begin
to
engage
with
Admiral
Van
Ghent
,
who
command
the
Amsterdam
Squadron
;
and
about
nine
the
whole
fleet
be
under
a
general
Engagement
.
<EOS>
the
Fight
last
till
ten
at
night
,
and
with
equal
Fury
on
all
side
,
the
French
except
,
who
appear
station
there
rather
as
Spectators
than
Parties
;
and
as
unwilling
to
be
too
much
upon
the
Offensive
,
for
fear
of
offend
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
Fight
the
English
Admiral
have
two
ship
disabled
under
him
;
and
be
oblige
about
four
in
the
Afternoon
to
remove
himself
a
third
time
into
the
London
,
where
he
remain'd
all
the
rest
of
the
Fight
,
and
till
next
Morning
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
on
his
entrance
upon
the
London
,
which
be
the
Ship
I
be
in
,
and
on
our
hoist
the
Standard
,
De
Ruyter
and
his
Squadron
seem'd
to
double
their
fire
upon
her
,
as
if
they
resolv'd
to
blow
her
out
of
the
Water
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
which
,
the
Duke
of
York
remain'd
all
the
time
upon
Quarter
Deck
,
and
as
the
Bullets
plentifully
whizz'd
<EOS>
around
him
,
would
often
rub
his
hand
,
and
cry
,
Sprage
,
<EOS>
Sprage
,
they
follow
us
still
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
sensible
later
time
have
not
be
over
favourable
in
their
sentiment
of
that
unfortunate
Prince
's
Valour
,
yet
I
can
not
omit
the
do
a
Piece
of
Justice
to
his
memory
,
in
relate
a
matter
of
fact
,
of
which
my
own
eye
be
witness
,
and
say
,
that
if
Intrepidity
,
and
Undauntedness
,
may
be
reckon'd
any
Parts
of
Courage
,
no
man
in
the
Fleet
better
deserv'd
the
Title

Couragious

behav'd

Gallantry

the

Royal

command
by
the
Earl

about
twelve
(

Dutch
Fire

<EOS>
take
Fire
,
blow
up
,
and
perish'd
;
and
with
her
a
great
many
brave
gentleman
,
as
well
as
sailor
;
and
amongst
the
rest
the
Earl
himself
,
concern
whom
I
shall
further
add
,
that
in
my
passage
from
Harwich
to
the
Brill
,
a
year
or
two
after
,
the
Master
of
the
Pacquet
Boat
tell
me
,
that
have
observ'd
a
great
Flock
of
Gulls
hover
in
one
particular
part
of
the
Sea
,
he
order'd
<EOS>
his
Boat
to
make
up
to
it
;
when
discover
a
Corpse
,
the
sailor
would
have
return'd
it
to
the
Sea
,
as
the
Corpse
of
a
dutch
man
;
but
keep
it
in
his
Boat
,
it
prove
to
be
that
of
the
Earl
of
Sandwich
.
<EOS>
there
be
find
about
him
between
twenty
and
thirty
Guineas
,
some
silver
,
and
his
Gold
Watch
;
restore
which
to
his
Lady
,
she
keep
the
Watch
,
but
reward
their
honesty
with
all
the
Gold
and
Silver
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
ship
the
English
lose
in
this
long
Engagement
.
<EOS>
for
although
the
Katherine
be
take
,
and
her
Commander
,
Sir
John
Chicheley
,
make
Prisoner
,
her
sailor
soon
after
find
the
opportunity
they
have
watch'd
for
,
seiz'd
all
the
Dutch
Sailors
,
who
have
be
put
in
upon
them
,
and
bring
the
Ship
back
to
our
own
Fleet
,
together
with
all
the
Dutch
Men
Prisoners
;
for
which
,
as
they
deserv'd
,
they
be
well
reward
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
same
ship
which
the
Earl
of
Mulgrave
(
afterwards
Duke
of
Buckingham
)
command
the
next
Sea
Fight
,
and
have
caus'd
to
be
paint
in
his
House
in
St.
James
's
Park
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
not
omit
one
very
remarkable
Occurrence
which
happen
in
this
ship
,
there
be
a
Gentleman
aboard
her
,
a
Voluntier
,
of
a
very
fine
estate
,
generally
know
by
the
Name
of
Hodge
Vaughan
.
<EOS>
this
person
receiv'd
,
in
the
beginning
of
the
Fight
,
a
considerable
Wound
,
which
the
great
Confusion
,
during
the
Battle
,
would
not
give
them
leave
to
inquire
into
;
so
he
be
carry
out
of
the
way
,
and
dispose
of
in
the
Hold
.
<EOS>
They
have
some
hog
aboard
,
which
the
Sailor
,
under
whose
care
they
be
,
have
neglect
to
feed
;
these
hog
,
hungry
as
they
be
,
find
out
,
and
fall
upon
the
wounded
person
,
and
between
dead
and
alive
eat
him
up
to
his
very
scull
,
which
,
after
the
Fight
be
over
,
and
the
ship
retake
,
as
before
,
be
all
that
could
be
find
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
another
Thing
,
less
to
be
account
for
,
happen'd
to
a
Gentleman
Voluntier
who
be
aboard
the
same
ship
with
my
self
.
<EOS>
He
be
of
know
personal
courage
,
in
the
vulgar
Notion
of
it
,
his
Sword
never
have
fail'd
<EOS>
him
in
many
private
duel
.
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
all
his
land
-
mettle
,
it
be
observ'd
of
him
at
Sea
,
that
when
ever
the
Bullets
whizz'd
over
his
Head
,
or
any
way
incommode
his
Ears
,
he
immediately
quit
the
Deck
,
and
run
down
into
the
Hold
.
<EOS>
at
first
he
be
gently
reproach'd
;
but
after
many
repetition
he
be
laugh'd
at
,
and
begin
to
be
despis'd
;
sensible
of
which
,
as
a
Testimonial
of
his
Valour
,
he
make
it
his
request
to
be
ty'd
to
the
Main
Mast
.
<EOS>
but
have
it
be
grant
him
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
see
any
title
he
could
have
plead
from
hence
,
to
true
Magnanimity
;
since
to
be
ty'd
from
run
away
can
import
nothing
less
,
than
that
he
would
have
still
continue
these
sign
of
Cowardice
,
if
he
have
not
be
prevent
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
Bravery
of
Mind
which
I
fansy
few
of
those
gentleman
Duellists
be
possess'd
of
.
<EOS>
true
Courage
can
not
proceed
from
what
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
finely
call
the
Art
or
Philosophy
of
Quarrel
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
It
must
be
the
Issue
of

but
to

the

one
Man

sink

<EOS>
this

last
fourteen
hour
,
and
be
look'd
<EOS>
upon
the
great
that
ever
be
fight
between
the
English
and
the
Hollander
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
here
omit
one
Thing
,
which
to
some
may
seem
trifling
;
though
I
be
apt
to
think
our
Naturalists
may
have
a
different
opinion
of
it
,
and
find
it
afford
their
fansie
no
undiverte
Employment
in
more
curious
,
and
less
perilous
Reflections
.
<EOS>
We
have
on
board
the
London
<EOS>
where
,
as
I
have
say
,
I
be
a
Voluntier
,
a
great
Number
of
Pidgeons
,
of
which
our
Commander
be
very
fond
.
<EOS>
these
,
on
the
first
firing
of
our
Cannon
,
dispers'd
,
and
fly
away

and
be

near

during

Fight

<EOS>
the
next
day
it
blow
a
brisk
Gale
,
and
drive
our
Fleet
some
Leagues
to
the
Southward
of
the
place
where
they
forsook
our
Ship
,
yet
the
day
after
they
all
return
safe
aboard
;
not
in
one
Flock
,
but
in
small
party
of
four
or
five
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
some
person
at
that
time
aboard
the
Ship
admire
at
the
Manner
of
their
return
,
and
speak
of
it
with
some
Surprize
,
Sir
Edward
Sprage
tell
them
,
that
he
bring
those
Pidgeons
with
him
from
the
Streights
;
and
that
when
,
pursuant
to
his
order
,
he
leave
the
Revenge
Man
of
War
,
to
go
aboard
the
London
,
all
those
Pidgeons
,
of
their
own
accord
,
and
without
the
Trouble
or
Care
of
carry
,
leave
the
revenge
likewise
,
and
remove
with
the
sailor
on
board
the
London
,
where
I
see
them
;
all
which
many
of
the
sailor
afterwards
confirm'd
to
me
.
<EOS>
what
sort
of
Instinct
this
could
proceed
from
,
I
leave
to
the
curious
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
this
Sea
Engagement
I
leave
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
and
the
Parliament
,
the
Winter
follow
,
manifest
their
resentment
against
two
of
the
Plenipotentiaries
,
viz
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
and
Arlington
,
who
have
be
send
over
into
Holland
;
and
express
,
withal
,
their
great
umbrage
take
at
the
prodigious
Progress
of
the
French
arm
in
the
United
Provinces
;
and
warmly
remonstrate
the
inevitable
Danger
attend
England
in
their
Ruin
.
<EOS>
King
Charles
from
all
this
,
and
for
want
of
the
expect
Supplies
,
find
himself
under
a
necessity
of
clap
up
a
speedy
peace
with
Holland
.
  
<EOS>
this
peace
leave
those
youthful
spirit
,
that
have
by
the
late
Naval
War
<EOS>
be
rais'd
into
a
generous
Ferment
,
under
a
perfect
inactivity
at
home
;
they
find
themselves
,
to
avoid
a
sort
of
life
that
be
their
aversion
,
oblig'd
to
look
out
for
one
more
active
,
and
more
suitable
to
their
vigorous
temper
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
acknowledge
my
self
one
of
that
number
;
and
therefore
in
the
Year
1674,1
resolv'd
to
go
into
flander
,
in
order
to
serve
as
Voluntier
in
the
Army
command
by
his
Highness
the
Prince
of
Orange
.
<EOS>
I
take
my
passage
accordingly
at
Dover
for
Calais
,
and
so
go
by
way
of
Dunkirk
for
Brussels
.
  
<EOS>
arrive
at
which
place
,
I
be
inform'd
that
the
Army
of
the
Confederates
lie
encamp'd
not
far
from
Nivelle
;
and
under
the
daily
Expectation
of
an
Engagement
with
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
this
News
make
me
press
forward
to
the
Service
;
for
which
purpose
I
carry'd
along
with
me
<EOS>
proper
letter
of
Recommendation
to
Sir
Walter
Vane
,
who
be
at
that
time
a
Major
-
general
.
<EOS>
upon
further
Enquiry
I
understand
,
that
a
Party
of
Horse
,
which
be
to
guard
some
waggon
that
be
go
to
Count
Montery
's
Army
,
be
to
set
out
next
morning
;
so
I
get
an
irish
Priest
to
introduce
me
to
the
Commanding
Officer
,
which
he
readily
oblig'd
me
in
;
and
they
,
as
I
wish'd
them
,
arriv'd
<EOS>
in
the
Camp
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
scarce
be
there
an
hour
,
when
happen'd
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
Accidents
in
Life
.
<EOS>
I
observ'd
in
the
East
<EOS>
a
strange
dusty
colour'd
cloud
,
of
a
pretty
large
extent
,
riding
,
not
before
the
Wind
(
for
it
be
a
perfect
Calm
)
with
such
a
precipitate
Motion
,
that
it
be
get
over
our
head
almost
as
soon
as
see
.
<EOS>
when
the
skirt
of
that
Cloud
begin
to
cover
our
camp
,
there
suddenly
arise
such
a
terrible
Hurricaine
,
or
Whirlwind
,
that
all
the
tent
be
carry'd
aloft
with
great
violence
into
the
air
;
and
soldier
'
hat
fly
so
high
and
thick
,
that
my
Fansy
can
resemble
it
to
nothing
well
than
those
flight
of
Rooks
,
<EOS>
which
at
Dusk
of
Evening
,
leave
the
field
,
seek
their
roosting
place
.
<EOS>
tree
be
tear
up
by
the
very
root
;
and
the
Roofs
of
all
the
Barns
,
&
c.
belong
to
the
Prince
's
Quarters
,
be
blow
quite
away
.
<EOS>
this
last
for
about
half
an
Hour
,
until
the
Cloud
be
wholly
past
over
us
,
when
as
suddenly
ensue
the
same
pacifik
Calm
as
before
the
Cloud
's
Approach
.
<EOS>
Its
course
be
seemingly
directly
west
;
and
yet
we
be
soon
after
inform'd
,
that
the
fine
Dome
of
the
great
Church
at
Utrecht
have
greatly
suffer'd
<EOS>
by
it
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
and
,
if
I
be
not
must
mistaken
,
Sir
William
Temple
,
in
his
Memoirs
,
mention
somewhat
of
it
,
which
he
feel
at
Lillo
,
on
his
return
from
the
Prince
of
Orange
's
Camp
,
where
he
have
be
a
day
or
two
before
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
after
this
,
as
I
could
get
an
opportunity
,
I
deliver'd
,
at
his
Quarters
,
my
recommendatory
letter
to
Sir
Walter
Vane
;
who
receiv'd
me
very
kindly
,
tell
me
at
the
same
time
,
that
there
be
six
or
seven
English
Gentlemen
,
who
have
enter'd
<EOS>
themselves
voluntier
in
the
Prince
's
own
Company
of
Guards
:
<EOS>
and
add
,
that
he
would
immediately
recommend
me
to
Count
Solmes
,
their
Colonel
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
bad
than
his
Word
,
and
I
be
enter'd
accordingly
.
<EOS>
those
six
gentleman
be
as
follow
,
 
Clavers
,
who
since
be
better
know
by
the
Title
of
Lord
Dundee
;
<EOS>
Mr.
Collier

now
Lord
Portmore
;
Mr.
Rooke

Major

Mr.

Governor

Mr.

,
Son
of
that
Venner
remarkable
for
his

one
of
the
Fifth
-
Monarchy
Men
;
and
Mr.
Boyce
.
<EOS>
the
four
first
rise
to
be
very
eminent
;
but
Fortune
be
not
to
all
alike
favourable
.
  
<EOS>
in
about
a
Week
's
time
after
,
it
be
resolv'd
in
a
Council
of
War
,
to
march
towards
Binch
,
a
small
wall'd
Town
,
about
four
league
from
Nivelle
;
the
well
to
cut
off
the
provision
from
come
to
the
Prince
of
Conde
's
camp
that
Way
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
on
the
first
Day
of
August
,
be
Saturday
,
we
begin
our
March
;
and
the
English
Voluntiers
have
the
Favour
of
a
Baggage
Waggon
appoint
them
.
<EOS>
Count
Souches
,
the
Imperial
General
,
with
the
troop
of
that
nation
,
lead
the
Van
;
the
main
body
be
compos'd
of
Dutch
,
under
the
Prince
of
Orange
.
<EOS>
as
Generalissimo
;
and
the
Spaniards
,
under
Prince
Vaudemont
,
with
some
detachment
,
make
the
Rear
Guard
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
be
upon
our
March
,
I
be
among
those
detachment
which
make
up
the
Rear
Guard
,
observ'd
<EOS>
a
great
Party
of
the
Enemy
's
Horse
upon
an
Ascent
,
which
,
I
then
imagin'd
,
as
it
after
prov'd
,
to
be
the
Prince
of
Conde
take
a
view
of
our
force
under
March
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
Defiles
,
which
our
Army
must
necessarily
pass
;
through
which
that
Prince
politickly
enough
permit
the
Imperial
and
Dutch
Forces
to
pass
unmoleste
.
<EOS>
but
when
Prince
Vaudemont
,
with
the
Spaniards
,
and
our
detachment
,
think
to
have
do
the
like
,
the
Prince
of
Conde
fall
on
our
Rear
Guard
;
and
,
after
a
long
and
sharp
dispute
,
entirely
route
'em
;
the
Marquiss
of
Assentar
,
a
Spanish
Lieutenant
-
General
,
die
upon
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
have
the
Prince
of
Conde
content
himself
with
this
share
of
good
Fortune
,
his
victory
have
be
unconteste
:
but
be
push
forward
by
a
vehement
Heat
of
Temper
(
which
he
be
note
for
)
and
flush'd
with
this
extraordinary
Success
,
he
resolv'd
to
force
the
whole
Confederate
Army
to
a
battle
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
which
,
he
immediately
lead
his
force
between
our
Second
Line
,
and
our
line
of
Baggage
;
by
which
mean
the
latter
be
entirely
cut
off
;
and
be
subject
to
the
Will
of
the
Enemy
,
who
fall
directly
to
plunder
;
in
which
they
be
not
a
little
assist
by
the
route
Spaniards
themselves
,
who
do
not
disdain
at
that
time
to
share
with
the
Enemy
in
the
plundering
of
their
Friends
and
Allies
.
  
<EOS>
the
English
Voluntiers
have
their
share
of
this
ill
Fortune
with
the
rest
;
their
Waggon
appoint
them
be
among
those
intercept
by
the
Enemy
;
and
I
,
for
my
part
,
lose
every
Thing
but
Life
,
which
yet
be
save
almost
as
unaccountably
as
my
Fellow
-
soldier
have
lose
theirs
.
<EOS>
the
Baggage
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
cut
off
,
and
at
the
Mercy
of
the
Enemy
,
every
one
endeavour'd
to
escape
through
,
or
over
the
Hedges
.
<EOS>
and
as
in
all
case
of
like
Confusion
,
one
endeavour
to
save
himself
upon
the
Ruins
of
other
:
so
here
,
he
that
find
himself
stopt
by
another
in
get
over
the
Cap
of
a
Hedge
,
pull'd
him
back
to
make
way
for
himself
,
and
perhaps
meet
with
the
same
Fortune
from
a
Third
,
to
the
destruction
of
all
.
<EOS>
I
be
then
in
the
Vigour
of
my
youth
,
and
none
of
the
least
active
,
and
perceive
how
it
have
far'd
with
some
before
me
,
I
clapt
my
left
Leg
upon
the
Shoulders
of
one
who
be
thus
contend
with
another
,
and
with
a
spring
throw
my
self
over
both
their
head
and
the
hedge
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
by
this
mean
I
not
only
sav'd
my
life
(
for
they
be
all
cut
to
piece
that
could
not
get
over
)
but
from
an
Eminence
,
which
I
soon
after
attain'd
,
I
have
an
opportunity
of
see
,
and
make
my
observation
upon
the
remain
part
of
that
glorious
conflict
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
from
that
advantageous
situation
,
that
I
presently
discover'd
that
the
Imperialists
,
who
lead
the
Van
,
have
now
<EOS>
join'd
<EOS>
the
main
body
.
<EOS>
and
,
I
confess
,
it
be
with
an
almost
inexpressible
Pleasure
,
that
I
beheld
,
about
three
a
-
Clock
,
with
what
intrepid
Fury
they
fall
upon
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
both
army
be
universally
engag'd
,
and
with
great
Obstinacy
dispute
the
victory
till
eleven
at
Night
.
<EOS>
at
which
Time
the
French
,
be
pretty
well
surfeited
,
make
their
retreat
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
to
secure
it
by
a
Stratagem
,
they
leave
their
light
match
hang
in
the
Hedges
,
and
wave
with
the
air
,
to
conceal
it
from
the
Confederate
Army
.
  
<EOS>
about
two
hour
after
,
the
Confederate
Forces
follow'd
the
example
of
their
enemy
,
and
draw
off
.
<EOS>
and
tho
'
neither
Army
have
much
reason
to
boast
;
yet
as
the
Prince
of
Orange
remain
last
in
the
field
;
and
die
French
have
lose
<EOS>
what
they
before
have
gain'd
,
the
Glory
of
the
day
fall
to
the
Prince
of
Orange
;
who
,
altho
'
but
twenty
-
four
year
of
Age
,
have
the
Suffrage
of
Friend
and
Foe
,
of
have
play'd
<EOS>
the
part
of
an
old
and
experienc'd
officer
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
leave
that
day
on
the
field
of
Battle
,
by
a
general
Computation
,
not
less
than
eighteen
thousand
Men
on
both
side
,
over
and
above
those
,
who
die
of
their
wound
:
<EOS>
the
loss
be
pretty
equal
,
only
the
French
carry
off
most
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Prince
Waldeck
be
shoot
through
the
Arm
,
which
I
be
near
enough
to
be
an
eye
-
witness
of
;
and
my
much
lament
Friend
,
Sir
Walter
Vane
,
be
carry
off
dead
.
<EOS>
a
Wound
in
the
arm
be
all
the
Mark
of
Honour
,
that
I
as
yet
could
boast
of
,
though
our
Cannon
in
the
Defiles
have
slay
many
near
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
Prince
of
Conde
(
as
we
be
next
Day
inform'd
)
lie
all
that
Night
under
a
Hedge
,
wrapp'd
<EOS>
in
his
cloke
:
and
either
from
the
mortification
of
be
disappoint
in
his
hope
of
victory
;
or
from
a
Reflection
of
the
Disservice
,
which
be
own
natural
over
Heat
of
Temper
have
draw
upon
him
,
be
almost
inconsolable
many
day
after
.
<EOS>
and
thus
end
the
famous
Battle
of
Seneff
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
common
vogue
have
give
it
the
name
of
a
battle
,
in
my
weak
Opinion
,
it
may
rather
deserve
that
of
a
confus'd
skirmish
;
all
thing
have
be
forcibly
carry
on
without
regularity
,
or
even
Design
enough
to
allow
it
any
high
denomination
:
<EOS>
for
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
notwithstanding
I
be
advantagiously
station
for
observation
,
I
find
it
very
often
impossible
to
distinguish
one
Party
from
another
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
more
remarkably
evident
on
the
part
of
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
whose
Valour
and
Vigour
have
lead
him
into
the
Middle
of
the
enemy
,
and
be
then
sensible
of
his
error
,
by
a
peculiar
presence
of
Mind
,
give
the
Word
of
Command
in
French
,
which
he
speak
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
but
the
French
Soldiers
,
who
take
him
for
one
of
their
own
general
,
make
answer
,
that
their
Powder
be
all
spend
,
it
afford
Matter
of
Instruction
to
him
to
persist
in
his
attack
;
at
the
same
time
,
that
it
give
him
a
lesson
of
Caution
,
to
withdraw
himself
,
as
soon
as
he
could
,
to
his
own
troop
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
day
after
the
Prince
of
Orange
think
proper
to
march
to
Quarignan
,
a
village
within
a
League
of
Mons
;
where
he
remain'd
<EOS>
some
Days
,
till
he
could
be
supply'd
from
brussell
with
those
Necessaries
which
his
Army
stand
in
need
of
.
  
<EOS>
from
thence
we
march'd
to
Valenciennes
,
where
we
again
encamp'd
,
till
we
could
receive
thing
proper
for
a
Siege
.
<EOS>
upon
the
Arrival
whereof
,
the
Prince
give
order
to
decamp
,
and
march'd
his
Army
with
a
design
to
besiege
Aeth
.
<EOS>
but
have
Intelligence
on
our
March
,
that
the
Mareschal
De
Humiers
have
reinforc'd
<EOS>
that
Garrison
,
we
march'd
directly
to
Oudenard
,
and
immediately
invest
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
Siege
be
carry
on
with
such
Application
and
Success
,
that
the
Besiegers
be
in
a
few
day
ready
for
a
storm
;
but
the
Prince
of
Conde
prevent
them
,
by
come
up
to
its
Relief
.
<EOS>
upon
which
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
pursuant
to
the
Resolution
of
a
Council
of
War
the
Night
before
,
draw
off
his
force
in
order
to
give
him
battle
;
and
to
that
purpose
,
after
the
laborious
work
of
fill
up
our
line
of
Contravallation
,
that
the
Horse
may
pass
more
freely
,
we
lay
upon
our
arm
all
Night
.
<EOS>
next
morning
we
expect
the
Imperial
General
,
Count
Souches
,
to
join
us
;
but
instead
of
that
,
he
send
back
some
very
frivolous
Excuses
,
of
the
Inconveniency
of
the
Ground
for
a
battle
;
and
after
that
,
instead
of
join
the
Prince
,
march
off
quite
another
way
;
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
with
the
dutch
and
spanish
troop
,
march
directly
for
Ghent
;
exclaim
publickly
against
the
Chicanery
of
Souches
,
and
openly
declare
,
that
he
have
be
advertis'd
of
a
Conference
between
a
French
Capuchin
and
that
General
,
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
that
that
General
lie
under
the
Displeasure
of
his
Master
,
the
Emperor
,
for
that
Piece
of
Management
;
and
the
Count
de
Sporck
be
immediately
appoint
General
in
his
place
.
  
<EOS>
the
Prince
of
Orange
be
hereupon
leave
the
Army
in
great
Disgust
,
till
prevail'd
upon
by
the
Count
de
Montery
,
for
the
general
Safety
,
to
recede
from
that
Resolution
.
<EOS>
however
,
see
no
likelihood
of
any
thing
further
to
be
do
,
while
Souches
be
in
Command
,
he
resolv'd
upon
a
Post
of
more
action
,
though
more
dangerous
;
<EOS>
wherefore
order
ten
Thousand
Men
to
march
before
,
he
himself
soon
after
foliow'd
to
the
Siege
of
Grave
.
  
<EOS>
the
Grave
,
a
strong
place
,
and
of
the
first
Moment
to
the
Hollanders
,
have
be
block'd
up
by
the
Dutch
Forces
all
the
Summer
;
the
Prince
of
Orange
therefore
leave
the
main
Army
under
Prince
Waldeck
at
Ghent
,
follow'd
<EOS>
the
Detachment
he
have
make
for
the
Siege
of
that
important
Place
,
resolve
to
purchase
it
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
on
his
arrival
before
it
,
thing
begin
to
find
new
Motion
;
and
as
they
be
carry
on
with
the
utmost
Application
and
Fury
,
the
Besieged
find
themselves
,
in
a
little
time
,
oblig'd
to
change
their
haughty
Summer
Note
for
one
more
suitable
to
the
Season
.
  
<EOS>
the
Prince
,
from
his
first
coming
,
have
keep
those
within
hotly
ply'd
with
Ball
,
both
from
Cannon
and
Mortars
,
Monsieur
Chamilly
,
the
Governor
,
after
a
few
day
,
be
weary
of
such
warm
work
,
desire
to
capitulate
;
upon
which
hostage
be
exchange
,
and
Articles
agree
on
next
morning
.
<EOS>
pursuant
to
which
,
the
Garrison
march'd
out
with
Drums
beat
and
colour
fly
,
two
day
after
,
and
be
conduct
to
Charleroy
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
taking
this
Place
,
which
make
the
Prince
of
Orange
the
more
earnest
upon
it
,
the
French
be
wholly
expell'd
their
last
year
's
astonishing
Conquests
in
Holland
.
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
another
Consideration
,
that
render'd
the
surrender
of
it
much
more
considerable
.
<EOS>
for
the
French
be
sensible
of
the
great
Strength
of
this
place
,
have
there
deposit
all
their
Cannon
and
Ammunition
,
take
from
their
other
Conquests
in
Holland
,
which
they
never
be
able
to
remove
or
carry
off
,
with
tolerable
prospect
of
Safety
,
after
that
Prince
's
Army
first
take
the
field
.
  
<EOS>
the
Enemy
be
march'd
out
,
the
Prince
enter'd
the
Town
,
and
immediately
order'd
public
Thanksgivings
for
its
happy
reduction
.
<EOS>
then
have
appoint
a
Governor
,
and
leave
a
sufficient
Garrison
,
he
put
an
end
to
that
campaign
,
and
return'd
to
the
Hague
,
where
he
have
not
be
long
before
he
fall
ill
of
the
Small
Pox
.
<EOS>
the
Consternation
this
throw
the
whole
country
into
,
be
not
to
be
express'd
;
any
one
that
have
see
it
would
have
think
,
that
the
French
have
make
another
inundation
great
than
the
former
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
Danger
be
over
,
their
Joy
and
Satisfaction
,
for
his
Recovery
,
be
equally
beyond
expression
.
  
<EOS>
the
Year
1675
yield
very
little
remarkable
in
our
Army
.
<EOS>
Limburgh
be
besiege
by
the
French
,
under
the
Command
of
the
Duke
of
Enguien
,
which
the
Prince
of
Orange
have
Intelligence
of
,
immediately
decamp'd
from
his
fine
Camp
at
Bethlem
,
near
Louvain
,
in
order
to
raise
the
Siege
.
<EOS>
but
as
we
be
on
a
full
March
for
that
purpose
,
and
have
already
reach'd
<EOS>
ruremond
,
Word
be
bring
,
that
the
Place
have
surrender'd
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
upon
which
Advice
,
the
Prince
,
after
a
short
Halt
,
make
his
little
Army
(
for
it
consist
not
of
more
than
thirty
Thousand
Men
)
march
back
to
Brabant
.
<EOS>
nothing
of
moment
,
after
this
,
occurr'd
all
that
campaign
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
Year
1676
,
the
Prince
of
Orange
have
,
in
concert
with
the
Spaniards
,
resolv'd
upon
the
important
Siege
of
Maestrich
(
the
only
Town
in
the
dutch
Provinces
,
then
remain
in
the
Hands
of
the
French
)
it
be
accordingly
invest
about
the
middle
of
June
,
with
an
Army
of
twenty
Thousand
Men
,
under
the
Command
of
his
Highness
Prince
Waldeck
,
with
the
grand
Army
cover
the
Siege
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
Time
before
the
heavy
Cannon
,
which
we
expect
up
the
Maes
,
from
Holland
,
arrive
;
which
give
Occasion
to
a
Piece
of
Raillery
of
Monsieur
Calvo
,
the
Governor
,
which
be
as
handsomely
<EOS>
repartec'd
.
<EOS>
that
Governor
,
by
a
Messenger
,
intimate
his
sorrow
to
find
,
we
have
pawn'd
<EOS>
our
Cannon
for
Ammunition
Bread
.
<EOS>
Answer
be
make
,
that
in
a
few
day
we
hope
to
give
him
a
taste
of
the
Loaves
,
which
he
should
find
would
be
send
him
into
the
Town
in
extraordinary
plenty
.
<EOS>
I
remember
another
Piece
of
Raillery
,
which
pass'd
<EOS>
some
day
after
between
the
Rhingrave
and
the
same
Calvo
.
<EOS>
the
former
send
Word
,
that
he
hope
within
three
week
to
salute
that
Governor
's
Mistress
within
the
place
.
<EOS>
Calvo
reply'd
,
He
would
give
him
leave
to
kiss
her
all
over
,
if
he
kiss'd
her
<EOS>
any
where
in
three
month
.
  
<EOS>
but
our
long
expect
Artillery
be
at
last
arriv'd
<EOS>
,
all
this
Jest
and
Merriment
be
soon
convert
into
earnest
.
<EOS>
Our
Trenches
be
immediately
open'd
<EOS>
towards
the
Dauphin
Bastion
,
against
which
be
plant
many
Cannon
,
in
order
to
make
a
Breach
;
my
self
as
a
Probationer
be
twice
put
upon
the
forlorn
Hope
to
facilitate
that
difficult
Piece
of
Service
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
long
before
such
a
Breach
be
effect
,
as
be
esteem'd
practicable
,
and
therefore
very
soon
after
it
be
order
to
be
attack'd
.
  
<EOS>
the
Disposition
for
the
attack
be
thus
order
;
two
serjeant
with
twenty
Grenadiers
,
a
captain
with
fifty
man
,
my
self
one
of
the
Number
;
then
a
Party
carry
Wool
Sacks
,
and
after
them
two
Captains
with
one
hundred
Men
more
;
the
Soldiers
in
the
trench
to
be
ready
to
sustain
them
,
as
Occasion
should
require
.
  
<EOS>
the
Signal
be
give
,
we
leave
our
Trenches
accordingly
,
have
about
one
hundred
Yards
to
run
,
before
we
could
reach
the
Breach
,
which
we
mount
with
some
Difficulty
and
Loss
;
all
our
battery
fire
at
the
same
instant
to
keep
our
action
in
countenance
,
and
favour
our
design
.
<EOS>
when
we
be
in
Possession
of
the
Bastion
,
the
Enemy
fir'd
most
furiously
upon
us
with
their
small
Cannon
through
a
thin
brick
Wall
,
by
which
,
and
their
hand
grenadoe
,
we
lose
more
men
than
we
do
in
the
attack
it
self
.
  
<EOS>
but
well
have
it
be
have
our
ill
Fortune
<EOS>
stopp'd
there
;
for
as
if
Disaster
must
need
be
the
Concomitant
of
Success
,
we
soon
lose
what
we
have
thus
get
,
by
a
small
,
but
very
odd
Accident
.
<EOS>
not
be
furnish
with
such
Scoopes
as
our
enemy
make
use
of
,
in
toss
their
hand
grenadoe
some
distance
off
,
one
of
our
own
Soldiers
aim
to
throw
one
over
the
Wall
into
the
Counterscarp
among
the
Enemy
,
it
so
happen'd
that
he
unfortunately
miss'd
<EOS>
his
Aim
,
and
the
Grenade
fall
down
again
on
our
side
the
Wall
,
very
near
the
person
who
fir'd
it
.
<EOS>
He
start
back
to
save
himself
,
and
some
other
who
see
it
fall
,
do
the
like
,
those
who
know
nothing
of
the
matter
fall
into
a
sudden
Confusion
,
and
imagine
some
great
danger
than
there
really
be
,
every
body
be
strike
with
a
panick
Fear
,
and
endeavour'd
to
be
the
first
who
should
quit
the
Bastion
,
and
secure
himself
by
a
real
Shame
from
an
imaginary
evil
.
<EOS>
thus
be
a
bastion
,
that
have
be
gloriously
gain'd
,
inadvertently
desert
;
and
that
too
,
with
the
loss
of
almost
as
many
man
in
the
retreat
,
as
have
be
slay
in
the
Onset
,
and
the
Enemy
most
triumphantly
again
take
Possession
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
Slain
on
our
side
in
this
action
,
be
an
Ensign
of
Sir
John
Fenwick
's
Regiment
;
and
as
an
approbation
of
my
Services
his
Commission
be
bestow
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
it
be
resolv'd
again
to
storm
that
Bastion
,
as
before
;
out
of
three
English
,
and
one
Scotch
Regiment
,
then
in
the
Camp

<EOS>
a
Captain

a

<EOS>
at
break
of
day
the
attack
be
begin
with
great
resolution
;
and
though
vigorously
maintain'd
,
be
attend
with
the
desir'd
Success
.
<EOS>
the
Bastion
be
again
take
,
and
in
it
the
command
Officer
,
who
in
Service
to
himself
,
more
than
to
us
,
tell
us
,
that
the
Center
of
the
Bastion
would
soon
be
blow
up
be
to
his
Knowledge
undermin'd
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
but
this
secret
prov'd
of
no
other
use
,
than
to
make
us
,
by
way
of
Precaution
,
to
keep
as
much
as
we
could
upon
the
Rampart
.
<EOS>
in
this
Attack
Captain
Barnwell
lose
his
life
;
and
it
happen
my
new
Commission
be
wet
(
not
,
as
too
frequently
be
the
Custom
,
with
a
Debauch
)
<EOS>
but
with
a
bullet
through
my
hand
,
and
the
Breach
of
my
Collar
Bone
with
the
stroke
of
a
Halberd
.
  
<EOS>
after
about
half
an
hour
's
possession
of
the
Bastion

the
mine
under
it

of
which
the
French
Officer
give
us
warning

the
Enemy
at
the

time
make
a
furious
Sally
upon
us
.
<EOS>
the
Mine
do
a
little
,
though
the
less

execution
,
for
be
discover
;
but
the
Sally
no
way
answer'd
<EOS>
their
end
,
for
we
beat
them
back
,
and
immediately
fix'd
our
lodgment
;
which
we
maintain'd
<EOS>
during
the
Time
of
the
Siege
.
<EOS>
but
to
our
double
Surprize
,
a
few
day
after
they
fir'd
another
mine
under
,
or
aside
,
the
former
,
in
which
they
have
plac'd
<EOS>
a
quantity
of
Grenadoes
,
which
do
much
more
execution
than
the
other
:
notwithstanding
all
which
,
a
Battery
of
Guns
be
presently
erect
upon
that
Bastion
,
which
very
considerably
annoy'd
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
the
Breach
for
a
general
storm
be
now
render'd
<EOS>
almost
practicable
;
yet
before
that
could
be
advisably
attempt
,
there
be
a
strong
horn
-
work
to
be
take
.
<EOS>
upon
this
Exploit
the
dutch
troop
only
be
to
signalize
themselves
;
and
they
answer
the
confidence
repos'd
<EOS>
in
them
;
for
though
they
be
twice
repuls'd
,
at
the
third
Onset
they
be
more
successful
,
and
take
possession
;
which
they
likewise
keep
to
the
raising
of
the
Siege
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
Stratagem
lay'd
at
this
Time
,
which
in
its
own
Merit
one
would
have
think
should
not
have
fail'd
of
a
good
effect
;
but
to
shew
the
Vanity
of
the
high
human
wisdom
<EOS>
it
miscarry'd
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
of
the
Maes
,
opposite
to
Maestrich
,
lie
the
strong
Fortress
of
Wyck
,
to
which
it
be
join'd
by
a
stone
Bridge
of
six
fair
arch
.
<EOS>
the
design
be
,
by
a
false
attack
on
that
regular
fortification
to
draw
the
Strength
of
the
Garrison
to
its
Defence
,
which
be
but
very
natural
to
imagine
would
be
the
Consequence
.
<EOS>
ready
to
attend
that
well
concert
false
attack
,
a
large
flat
bottom'd
boat
,
properly
furnish'd
with
Barrels
of
Gun
-
Powder
,
and
other
Necessaries
,
be
to
fall
down
under
one
of
the
middle
Arches
,
and
when
fix'd
there
,
by
fire
the
Powder
to
have
blow
up
the
Bridge
,
and
by
that
mean
to
have
prevent
the
Return
of
the
Garrison
to
oppose
a
real
attack
at
that
instant
of
Time
to
be
make
upon
the
Town
of
Maestrich
by
the
whole
Army
.
  
<EOS>
the
false
attack
on
Wyck
be
accordingly
make
,
which
,
as
propos'd
,
draw
the
Main
of
the
Garrison
of
Maestrich
to
its
Defence
,
and
the
Boat
<EOS>
so
furnish'd
fall
down
the
River
as
project
,
but
unfortunately
,
before
it
could
reach
the
Arch
,
from
the
darkness
of
the
Night
,
run
upon
a
Shoal
,
it
could
not
be
get
off
;
for
which
reason
the
Men
in
the
Boat
be
glad
to
make
a
hasty
Escape
for
fear
of
be
discover
;
as
the
Boat
be
,
next
morning
;
and
the
whole
design
lay
open
.
  
<EOS>
this
Stratagem
thus
miscarry
,
all
thing
be
immediately
get
ready
for
a
general
Storm
,
at
the
main
Breach
in
the
Town
;
and
the
rather
,
because
the
Prince
of
Orange
have
receiv'd
<EOS>
incontestable
Intelligence
,
that
Duke
Schomberg
,
at
the
Head
of
the
French
Army
,
be
in
full
march
to
relieve
the
place
.
<EOS>
but
before
every
thing
could
be
rightly
get
ready
for
the
intend
Storm
(
though
some
there
be
who
pretend
to
say
,
that
a
dispute
rais'd
by
the
Spaniards
with
the
Dutch
,
about
the
Propriety
of
the
Town
,
when
take
,
be
the
cause
of
that
Delay
)
<EOS>
we
hear
at
some
distance
several
Guns
fir'd
as
Signals
of
relief
;
upon
which
we
precipitately
,
and
,
as
most
imagin'd
,
shamefully
draw
off
from
before
the
place
,
and
join'd
the
grand
Army
under
Prince
Waldeck
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
matter
of
yet
great
Surprize
to
most
on
the
Spot
,
that
when
the
army
be
so
joyn'd
,
we
do
not
stay
to
offer
the
Enemy
Battle
.
<EOS>
the
well
know
courage
of
the
Prince
,
then
Generalissimo
,
be
so
far
from
solve
this
riddle
,
that
it
rather
puzzle
all
who
think
of
it
;
however
,
the
prevail
Opinion
be
,
that
it
be
occasion'd
<EOS>
by
some
great
misunderstanding
between
the
Spaniards
and
the
Dutch
.
<EOS>
and
experience
will
evince
,
that
this
be
not
the
only
disappointment
of
that
Nature
,
occasion'd
by
imperfect
Understandings
.
  
<EOS>
besides
the
number
of
common
soldier
slay
in
this
Attack
,
which
be
not
inconsiderable
,
we
lose
here
<EOS>
the
brave
Rhingrave
,
a
person
much
lament
on
account
of
his
many
other
excellent
qualification
,
as
well
as
that
of
a
General
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Ralph
Widdrington
,
and
Colonel
Doleman
(
who
have
not
<EOS>
enjoy'd
Widdrington
's
Commission
above
a
Fortnight
)
.
<EOS>
Captain
Douglas
,
Captain
Barnwell
,
and
Captain
Lee
,
be
of
the
Slain
among
the
English
;
who
,
indeed
,
have
bear
the
whole
brunt
of
the
Attack
upon
the
Dauphin
's
Bastion
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
during
the
Siege
,
receiv'd
<EOS>
a
shot
through
his
arm
;
<EOS>
which
give
an
immediate
Alarm
to
the
troop
under
his
command
,
he
take
his
hat
off
his
Head
with
the
wounded
arm
,
and
smile
,
wav'd
it
,
to
shew
them
<EOS>
there
be
no
danger
.
<EOS>
thus
,
after
the
most
gallant
Defence
against
the
most
couragious
Onsets
,
end
the
Siege
of
Maestrich
;
and
with
it
all
that
be
material
that
campaign
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
the
spring
,
in
the
Year
1677
,
the
french
Army
,
under
the
Duke
of
Orleans
,
besiege
at
once
,
both
Cambray
and
Saint
Omers
.
<EOS>
this
last
the
Prince
of
Orange
seem'd
<EOS>
very
intent
and
resolute
to
relieve
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
which
,
well
know
by
sad
experience
,
it
would
be
to
little
purpose
to
wait
the
majestick
Motions
of
the
Spaniards
,
that
Prince
get
together
what
force
he
could
,
all
in
dutch
Pay
,
and
march
forward
with
all
speed
,
resolv'd
,
even
at
the
Hazard
of
a
Battle
,
to
attempt
the
raise
the
Siege
.
<EOS>
upon
his
appear
the
Duke
of
Orleans
,
to
whose
particular
conduct
the
care
of
that
Siege
be
commit
,
draw
off
from
before
the
Place
,
leave
scarce
enough
of
his
man
to
defend
the
Trenches
.
<EOS>
the
Prince
be
under
the
necessity
of
march
his
force
over
a
Morass
;
and
the
Duke
,
<EOS>
well
know
it
,
take
care
to
attack
him
near
Mont
Cassel
,
before
half
his
little
Army
be
get
over
.
<EOS>
the
Dispute
be
very
sharp
,
but
the
Prince
be
much
out
number'd
,
and
his
troop
not
able
,
by
the
Straitness
of
the
Passage
,
to
engage
all
at
once
,
be
oblig'd
<EOS>
at
last
to
retreat
,
which
he
do
in
pretty
good
order
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
Dutch
Troops
do
not
all
alike
do
their
duty
;
and
the
Prince
see
one
of
the
Officers
on
his
full
speed
,
call'd
to
him
over
and
over
to
halt
;
which
the
Officer
in
too
must
haste
to
obey
,
the
Prince
give
him
a
slash
over
the
face
,
say
,
by
this
Mark
I
shall
know
you
another
time
.
<EOS>
soon
after
this
retreat
of
the
Prince
,
Saint
Omers
be
surrender'd
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
retreat
the
Prince
march
back
,
lie
for
some
time
among
the
Boors
,
who
from
the
good
Discipline
,
which
he
take
care
to
make
his
troop
observe
,
do
not
give
us
their
customary
boorish
Reception
.
<EOS>
and
yet
as
secure
as
we
may
think
our
self
,
I
meet
with
a
little
passage
that
confirm'd
<EOS>
in
me
the
notion
,
which
the
generality
as
well
as
I
,
have
imbib'd
of
the
private
barbarity
of
those
People
,
whenever
an
opportunity
fall
in
their
way
.
<EOS>
I
be
strole
at
a
Distance
from
my
Quarters
,
all
alone
,
when
I
find
my
self
near
one
of
their
house
;
into
which
,
the
door
be
open
,
I
ventur'd
to
enter
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
body
when
I
come
in
,
though
the
House
be
,
for
that
sort
of
People
,
well
enough
furnish'd
,
and
in
pretty
decent
order
.
<EOS>
I
call'd
,
but
no
body
answer
,
I
have
the
Curiosity
to
advance
a
little
farther
,
when
,
at
the
Mouth
of
the
Oven
,
which
have
not
yet
wholly
lose
its
Heat
,
I
spy'd
the
Corpse
of
a
man
so
bloated
,
swoln
and
parch'd
,
as
leave
me
little
room
to
doubt
,
that
the
Oven
have
be
the
Scene
of
his
Destiny
.
<EOS>
I
confess
the
Sight
strike
me
with
Horror
;
and
as
much
Courage
and
Security
as
I
enter'd
<EOS>
with
,
I
withdraw
in
haste
,
and
with
quite
different
sentiment
,
and
could
not
fansy
my
self
out
of
Danger
till
I
have
reach'd
<EOS>
our
camp
.
<EOS>
a
wise
man
should
not
frame
an
accusation
on
conjecture
;
but
,
on
Inquiry
,
I
be
soon
make
sensible
,
that
such
barbarous
Usage
be
too
common
among
those
People
;
especially
if
they
meet
with
a
Straggler
,
of
what
nation
soever
.
  
<EOS>
this
make
me
not
very
sorry
when
we
decamp'd
,
and
we
soon
after
receiv'd
Orders
to
march
and
invest
Charleroy
;
before
which
place
we
stay'd
<EOS>
somewhat
above
a
week
,
and
then
draw
off
.
<EOS>
I
remember
very
well
,
that
I
be
not
the
only
person
then
in
the
Camp
that
be
at
a
loss
to
dive
into
the
Reason
of
this
Investiture
and
Decampment
:
<EOS>
but
since
I
at
that
time
,
among
the
politician
of
the
Army
,
never
hear
a
good
one
,
I
shall
not
venture
to
offer
my
sentiment
at
so
great
a
Distance
.
  
<EOS>
We
,
after
this
march'd
towards
mon
;
and
,
in
our
March
,
pass'd
over
the
very
Grounds
on
which
the
Battle
of
Seneff
have
be
fight
three
year
before
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
no
little
Pleasure
,
that
I
re
-
survey'd
a
Place
<EOS>
,
that
have
once
be
of
so
much
Danger
to
me
;
and
where
my
Memory
and
Fansy
now
repeat
back
all
those
observation
I
have
then
make
under
some
unavoidable
Confusion
.
<EOS>
young
as
I
be
,
both
in
year
and
experience
,
from
my
own
Reflections
,
and
the
sentiment
of
other
,
after
the
Fight
be
over
,
methought
<EOS>
I
see
visibly
before
me
<EOS>
the
well
order'd
disposition
of
the
Prince
of
Conde
;
the
inexpressible
difficulty
which
the
Prince
of
Orange
have
to
encounter
with
;
while
at
the
same
Moment
I
could
not
omit
to
repay
my
debt
to
the
memory
of
my
first
Patron
,
Sir
Walter
Vane
,
who
there
loose
his
Life
,
leave
me
a
solitary
Wanderer
to
the
wide
World
of
Fortune
.
  
<EOS>
but
these
thought
soon
give
place
to
new
object
,
which
every
Hour
present
themselves
in
our
continu'd
March
to
Enghien
,
a
Place
famous
for
the
fine
Gardens
in
all
flander
,
near
which
we
encamp'd
,
on
the
very
same
ground
which
the
French
choose
some
year
after
at
the
Battle
of
Steenkirk
:
of
which
I
shall
speak
in
its
proper
place
.
<EOS>
here
the
Prince
of
Orange
leave
our
Army
,
as
we
afterwards
find
,
to
pass
into
England
;
<EOS>
where
he
marry'd
<EOS>
the
Princess
Mary
,
Daughter
of
the
Duke
of
York
.
<EOS>
and
after
his
departure
,
that
campaign
end
without
any
thing
further
material
.
  
<EOS>
now
begin
the
Year
1678
,
famous
for
the
peace
,
and
no
less
remarkable
for
an
action
previous
to
it
,
which
have
not
fail'd
to
employ
the
talent
of
Men
,
variously
,
as
they
stand
affected
.
<EOS>
Our
Army
,
under
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
lie
encamp'd
<EOS>
at
Soignies
,
where
it
be
whisper'd
that
the
peace
be
conclude
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
which
,
two
day
after
,
be
Sunday
the
17th
day
of
August
,
the
Army
be
draw
out
,
as
most
other
as
well
as
my
self
apprehend
,
in
order
to
feux
de
Joye
;
but
in
lieu
of
that
,
we
find
our
March
order'd
towards
St.
Dennis
,
where
the
Duke
of
Luxembourg
lie
,
as
he
imagin'd
,
safe
in
inaccessible
entrenchment
.
  
<EOS>
about
three
of
the
Clock
our
Army
arriv'd
<EOS>
there
,
when
we
receiv'd
Orders
to
make
the
attack
.
<EOS>
It
begin
with
a
most
vigorous
Spirit
,
that
promis'd
no
less
than
the
Success
which
ensu'd
.
<EOS>
the
three
English
and
three
Scotch
Regiments
,
under
the
Command
of
the
ever
renown'd
Earl
of
Ossory
,
together
with
the
Prince
of
Orange
's
Guards
,
make
their
attack
at
a
place
call'd
the
Chateau
;
where
the
French
take
their
Refuge
among
a
Parcel
of
Hop
-
Poles
;
but
their
resource
be
as
weak
as
their
Defence
;
and
they
be
soon
beat
out
with
a
very
great
Slaughter
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
here
that
a
French
Officer
have
his
Pistol
direct
at
the
Breast
of
the
Prince
,
Monsieur
D'Auverquerque
interpos'd
,
and
shoot
the
Officer
dead
upon
the
Spot
.
  
<EOS>
the
Fight
last
from
three
in
the
Afternoon
till
nine
at
night
;
when
grow
dark
,
the
Duke
of
Luxembourg
forsook
his
Entrenchments
,
<EOS>
into
which
we
march'd
<EOS>
next
morning
.
<EOS>
and
to
see
the
sudden
change
of
thing
!
<EOS>
that
very
Spot
of
Ground
,
where
nothing
but
Fire
and
Fury
appear'd
<EOS>
the
day
before
,
the
yest
see
solac'd
with
the
Proclamation
of
a
peace
.
  
<EOS>
about
an
hour
before
the
attack
begin
,
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
arriv'd
<EOS>
in
the
Army
,
be
kindly
receiv'd
by
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
bravely
fight
by
his
side
,
all
that
day
.
<EOS>
the
Woods
and
the
Unevenness
of
the
ground
,
render'd
the
Cavalry
almost
useless
;
yet
I
see
a
Standard
,
among
some
other
,
which
be
take
from
the
Enemy
,
be
richly
embroider
with
Gold
and
silver

the
Sun

Zodiack

with
these
haughty
word
,
Nihil

<EOS>
on
the
News
of
this
unexpected
Victory
,
the
States
of
Holland
send
to
congratulate
the
Prince
;
and
to
testify
how
much
they
value
his
Preservation
,
they
present
Monsieur
D'Auverquerque
,
who
have
so
bravely
rescue
him
,
with
a
Sword
,
whose
Handle
be
of
massy
gold
set
with
diamond
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
mention
that
this
Gentleman
receiv'd
a
Shot
on
his
Head
at
the
Battle
of
Seneff
;
and
truly
in
all
action
,
which
be
many
,
he

<EOS>

of
Nimeugen
,
the
Regiment
in
which
I
serv'd
,
be
appoint
to
be
in
Garrison
at
the
Grave
.
<EOS>
We
lie
there
near
four
year
,
our
soldier
be
mostly
employ'd
about
the
Fortifications
.
<EOS>
It
be
here
,
and
by
that
Means
,
that
I
imbib'd
<EOS>
the
Rudiments
of
Fortification
,
and
the
practick
part
of
an
Enginier
,
which
in
my
more
advanc'd
year
be
of
no
small
Service
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
in
the
Year
1684
,
our
Regiment
receiv'd
order
to
march
to
Haren
,
near
Brussels
,
where
,
with
other
Forces
,
we
encamp'd
,
till
we
hear
that
Luxemburg
,
invade
by
the
French
,
in
a
time
of
the
profound
Peace
,
have
surrender'd
to
them
.
<EOS>
then
we
decamp'd
,
and
march'd
to
Mechlin
;
where
we
lay
in
the
field
till
near
November
.
<EOS>
not
that
there
be
any
War
proclaim'd
;
but
as
not
know
,
whether
those
who
have
commit
such
act
of
Hostility
in
time
of
peace
may
not
take
it
in
their
head
to
proceed
yet
further
.
<EOS>
in
November
we
march'd
into
that
Town
,
where
Count
Nivelle
be
Governor
:
the
Marquiss
de
Grana
,
at
the
same
time
,
govern
the
Netherlands
in
the
Jurisdiction
of
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
of
any
Moment
happen'd
<EOS>
after
this
,
till
the
Death
of
King
Charles
II
.
<EOS>
the
Summer
after
which
,
the
three
English
and
three
Scotch
Regiments
receiv'd
order
to
pass
over
into
England
,
upon
the
Occasion
of
Monmouth
's
rebellion
;
where
,
upon
our
arrival
,
we
receiv'd
order
to
encamp
on
Hounslow
-
Heath
.
<EOS>
but
that
rebellion
be
soon
stifle
,
and
King
James
have
no
farther
Need
of
us
,
those
regiment
be
order'd
to
return
again
to
Holland
,
into
the
proper
Service
of
those
who
pay
them
.
  
<EOS>
tho
'
I
be
no
stiff
Adherer
to
the
Doctrine
of
Predestination
,
yet
to
the
full
assurance
of
a
Providence
I
never
could
fail
to
adhere
.
<EOS>
Thence
come
it
,
that
my
natural
Desire
to
serve
my
own
native
country
prevail'd
upon
me
to
quit
the
Service
of
another
,
though
its
Neighbour
and
Allie
.
<EOS>
event
be
not
always
to
direct
the
Judgment
;
and
therefore
whether
I
do
best
in
follow
those
fondle
Dictates
of
Nature
,
I
shall
neither
question
nor
determine
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
not
long
after
my
arrival
in
England
before
I
have
a
Commission
give
me
by
King
James
,
to
be
a
Lieutenant
in
a
new
rais'd
Regiment
under
the
Command
of
Colonel
Tufton
,
brother
to
the
Earl
of
Thanet
.
<EOS>
under
this
Commission
I
sojourn'd
out
<EOS>
two
peaceable
campaign
on
Hounslow
-
Heath
;
where
I
be
an
Eye
-
Witness
of
one
mock
Siege
of
Buda
:
after
which
our
Regiment
be
order'd
to
Berwick
,
where
I
remain
till
the
Revolution
.
  
<EOS>
King
James
have
abdicate
the
throne
,
and
the
Prince
of
Orange
accept
the
administration
,
all
commission
be
order'd
to
be
renew'd
<EOS>
in
his
Name
.
<EOS>
the
officer
of
our
Regiment
,
as
well
as
other
,
severally
take
out
theirs
accordingly
,
a
very
few
except
,
of
which
Number
be
our
Colonel
;
who
refuse
a
Compliance
,
his
Commission
be
give
to
Sir
James
Lesley
.
  
<EOS>
the
Prince
of
Orange
presently
after
be
declar'd
and
proclaim'd
King
,
and
his
Princess
Queen
,
with
a
conjunctive
power
.
<EOS>
upon
which
our
Regiment
be
order'd
into
Scotland
,
where
affair
appear'd
under
a
face
of
Disquietude
.
<EOS>
We
have
our
quarter
at
Leith
,
till
the
Time
the
Castle
of
Edinburgh
,
then
under
the
Command
of
the
Duke
of
Gordon
,
have
surrender'd
.
<EOS>
after
which
,
pursuant
to
fresh
order
,
we
march'd
to
Inverness
,
a
place
of
no
great
strength
,
and
as
little
Beauty
;
though
yet
I
think
I
may
say
,
without
the
least
Danger
of
an
Hyperbole
,
that
it
be
as
pleasant
as
most
place
in
that
country
.
<EOS>
here
we
lay
two
long
Winters
,
perpetually
harrass'd
upon
party
,
and
hunting
of
somewhat
wild
than
their
wildest
Game
,
namely
,
the
Highlanders
,
who
be
,
if
not
as
nimble
footed
,
yet
fully
as
hard
to
be
find
.
  
<EOS>
but
General
Mackay
have
receiv'd
Orders
to
build
a
Fort
at
Inverlochy
,
our
Regiment
,
among
other
,
be
command
to
that
Service
.
<EOS>
the
two
Regiments
appoint
on
the
same
Duty
,
with
some
few
dragoon
,
be
already
on
their
March
,
which
have
join'd
,
we
march'd
together
through
Louquebar
.
<EOS>
this
sure
be
the
wildest
Country
in
the
Highlands
,
if
not
in
the
World
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
one
House
in
all
our
March
;
and
their
Oeconomy
,
if
I
may
call
it
such
,
be
much
the
same
with
that
of
the
Arabs
or
Tartars
.
<EOS>
Hutts
,
or
Cabins
of
Trees
and
Trash
,
be
their
place
of
Habitation
;
in
which
they
dwell
,
till
their
half
-
horn'd
Cattle
have
devour'd
the
Grass
,
and
then
remove
,
stay
<EOS>
no
where
longer
than
that
Convenience
invite
them
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
March
,
or
rather
,
if
you
please
,
most
dismal
peregrination
,
we
could
be
very
rarely
go
two
on
a
breast
;
and
oftner
,
like
Geeze
in
a
string
,
one
after
another
.
<EOS>
so
that
our
very
little
Army
have
sometimes
,
or
rather
most
commonly
,
an
extent
of
many
mile
;
our
enemy
,
the
Highlanders
,
fire
down
upon
us
from
their
summit
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
possible
for
our
men
,
or
very
rarely
at
least
,
to
return
their
favour
with
any
prospect
of
Success
;
for
as
they
pop'd
upon
us
always
on
a
sudden
,
they
never
stay'd
long
enough
to
allow
any
of
our
soldier
a
Mark
;
or
even
time
enough
to
fire
:
<EOS>
and
for
our
man
to
march
,
or
climb
up
those
Mountains
,
which
to
them
be
natural
Champion
,
would
have
be
as
dangerous
as
it
seem'd
to
us
impracticable
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
under
all
these
disheartne
disadvantage
,
we
arriv'd
at
Inverlochy
,
and
there
perform'd
the
Task
appoint
,
build
a
Fort
on
the
same
Spot
where
Cromwell
have
<EOS>
rais'd
one
before
.
<EOS>
and
which
be
not
a
little
remarkable
,
we
have
with
us
one
Hill
,
a
Colonel
,
who
have
be
Governor
in
Oliver
's
Time
,
and
who
be
now
again
appoint
Governor
by
General
Mackay
.
<EOS>
thus
the
work
on
which
we
be
send
be
effect
,
we
march'd
back
again
by
the
Way
of
Gillycrancky
,
where
that
memorable
Battle
under
Dundee
have
be
fight
the
Year
before
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
after
,
Sir
Thomas
Levingston
,
afterwards
Earl
of
Tiviot
,
have
receiv'd
<EOS>
Intelligence
that
the
Highlanders
intend
to
fall
down
into
the
low
Countries
,
in
a
considerable
body
,
get
together
a
Party
of
about
five
hundred
(
the
Dragoons
,
call'd
<EOS>
the
Scotch
Greys
,
inclusive
)
<EOS>
with
which
he
resolv'd
,
if
possible
,
to
give
them
a
meeting
.
<EOS>
We
leave
Inverness
the
last
day
of
April
,
and
encamp'd
near
a
little
Town
call'd
Forrest
,
the
place
where
,
as
Tradition
still
confidently
aver
,
the
witch
meet
Mackbeth
,
and
greet
him
with
their
diabolical
Auspices
.
<EOS>
but
this
story
be
so
naturally
display'd
in
a
play
of
the
immortal
Shakespear
,
that
I
need
not
descend
here
to
any
farther
Particulars
.
  
<EOS>
here
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
receiv'd
Intelligence
,
that
the
Highlanders
design'd
to
encamp
upon
the
Spey
,
near
the
Laird
of
Grant
's
Castle
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
we
begin
our
March
about
Noon
;
and
the
next
day
,
about
the
break
thereof
,
we
come
to
that
River
,
where
we
soon
discover'd
the
Highlanders
by
their
fire
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
immediately
,
on
Sight
of
it
,
issue
his
Orders
for
our
ford
the
River
,
and
fall
upon
them
as
soon
after
as
possible
.
<EOS>
both
be
accordingly
perform'd
,
and
with
so
good
order
,
Secrecy
and
Success
,
that
Cannon
and
Balfour
,
their
commander
,
be
oblige
to
make
their
escape
naked
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
about
one
thousand
in
Number
,
of
which
be
kill'd
about
three
hundred
;
we
pursue
them
,
till
they
get
up
Crowdale
-
Hill
,
where
we
lose
them
in
a
fog
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
so
high
be
that
Hill
,
that
they
,
who
perfectly
know
it
,
assure
me
that
it
never
be
without
a
little
dark
Fog
hang
over
it
.
<EOS>
and
to
me
,
at
that
instant
of
Time
,
they
seem'd
rather
to
be
People
receiv'd
up
into
cloud
,
than
fly
from
an
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
near
this
there
be
an
old
Castle
,
call'd
<EOS>
Lethendy
,
into
which
about
Fifty
of
them
make
their
retreat
,
most
of
them
Gentlemen
,
resolve
there
to
defend
themselves
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
send
a
Messenger
to
them
,
with
an
offer
of
Mercy
,
if
they
would
surrender
:
but
they
refus'd
<EOS>
the
profer'd
quarter
,
and
fir'd
upon
our
man
,
kill
two
of
our
Grenadiers
,
and
wound
another
.
<EOS>
during
my
quarter
at
the
Grave
,
have
learn
to
throw
a
Grenado
,
I
take
three
or
four
in
a
Bag
,
and
creep
down
by
the
side
of
a
ditch
,
or
Dyke
,
to
an
old
thatch'd
house
near
the
Castle
,
imagine
,
on
my
mount
the
same
,
I
may
be
near
enough
to
throw
them
,
so
as
to
do
execution
.
<EOS>
I
find
all
thing
answer
my
expectation
;
and
the
Castle
want
a
cover
,
I
throw
in
a
Grenado
,
which
put
the
Enemy
immediately
into
Confusion
.
<EOS>
the
Second
have
not
so
good
Success
,
fall
short
,
and
the
third
burst
as
soon
as
it
be
well
out
of
my
hand
,
though
without
damage
to
my
self
.
<EOS>
but
throw
the
Fourth
in
at
a
Window
,
it
so
increas'd
the
Confusion
,
which
the
first
have
put
them
into
,
that
they
immediately
call'd
out
to
me
,
upon
their
Parole
of
Safety
,
to
come
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
I
go
up
to
the
Door
,
which
they
have
barricade
,
and
make
up
with
great
stone
;
when
they
tell
me
they
be
ready
to
surrender
upon
condition
of
obtain
Mercy
.
<EOS>
I
return'd
to
Sir
Thomas
;
and
tell
him
what
I
have
do
,
and
the
Consequence
of
it
,
and
the
message
they
have
<EOS>
desir'd
<EOS>
me
to
deliver
(
a
great
many
of
the
Highland
Gentlemen
,
not
of
this
Party
,
be
with
him
)
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
,
in
a
high
voice
,
and
broad
Scotch
,
good
to
be
hear
and
understand
,
order'd
<EOS>
me
back
to
tell
'em
<EOS>
,
He
would
cut
them
all
to
piece
,
for
their
murder
of
two
of
his
Grenadiers
,
after
his
Proffer
of
Quarter
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
return
full
of
these
melancholy
tiding
,
when
Sir
Thomas
,
advance
after
me
a
little
Distance
from
the
rest
of
the
Company
;
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
Sir
,
say
he
,
I
believe
there
may
be
among
'em
some
of
our
old
Acquaintance
(
for
we
have
serv'd
together
in
the
Service
of
the
States
in
Flanders
)
<EOS>
therefore
tell
them
they
shall
have
good
quarter
.
<EOS>
I
very
willingly
carry'd
<EOS>
back
a
message
to
much
chang'd
to
my
mind
;
and
upon
deliver
of
it
,
without
the
least
hesitation
,
they
throw
down
the
Barricado
,
open'd
<EOS>
the
Door
,
and
out
come
one
Brody
,
who
,
as
he
then
tell
me
,
have
have
a
Piece
of
his
Nose
take
off
by
one
of
my
grenadoe
.
<EOS>
I
carry'd
him
to
Sir
Thomas
,
who
confirm
my
message
,
they
all
come
out
,
and
surrender
themselves
Prisoners
.
<EOS>
this
happen'd
on
May
Day
in
the
morning
;
for
which
reason
we
return'd
to
Inverness
with
our
Prisoners
,
and
bough
in
our
hat
;
and
the
Highlanders
never
hold
up
their
head
so
high
after
this
Defeat
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
Success
Sir
Thomas
write
to
Court
,
give
a
full
Account
of
the
whole
action
.
<EOS>
in
which
be
pleas'd
to
make
mention
of
my
Behaviour
,
with
some
Particularities
,
I
have
soon
after
a
Commission
order'd
me
for
a
Company
in
the
Regiment
under
the
Command
of
Brigadier
Tiffin
.
  
<EOS>
My
Commission
be
make
out
,
sign'd
,
and
send
to
me
,
I
repair'd
immediately
to
Portsmouth
,
where
the
Regiment
lie
in
Garrison
.
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
I
have
be
there
,
Admiral
Russel
arriv'd
with
the
Fleet
,
and
anchor'd
at
St.
Hellen
's
,
where
he
remain'd
about
a
Week
.
<EOS>
on
the
18th
of
May
the
whole
Fleet
set
Sail
;
and
it
be
my
turn
the
same
day
to
mount
the
Main
Guard
,
I
be
go
the
Rounds
very
early
,
when
I
hear
great
shooting
at
Sea
.
<EOS>
I
go
directly
to
acquaint
the
Governor
,
and
tell
him
my
sentiment
,
that
the
two
contend
fleet
be
actually
engag'd
,
which
indeed
prov'd
true
;
for
that
very
Night
a
Pinnace
,
which
come
from
our
Fleet
,
bring
News
that
Admiral
Russel
have
engag'd
<EOS>
the
French
Admiral
Turvile
;
<EOS>
and
,
after
a
long
and
sharp
dispute
,
be
make
after
them
to
their
own
Coasts
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
towards
evening
,
several
other
Expresses
arriv'd
,
one
after
another
,
all
agree
in
the
Defeat
of
the
French
Fleet
,
and
in
the
Particulars
of
the
burn
their
rise
Sun
,
together
with
many
other
of
their
Men
of
War
,
at
la
Hogue
.
<EOS>
all
which
express
be
immediately
forward
to
Court
by
Mr.
Gibson
,
our
Governor
.
  
<EOS>
about
two
month
after
this
,
our
Regiment
,
among
many
other
,
be
,
accord
to
Order
,
<EOS>
shipp'd
off
on
a
Secret
Expedition
,
under
the
Command
of
the
Duke
of
Leinster
,
no
man
know
to
what
place
we
be
go
,
or
on
what
design
;
no
,
not
the
Commander
himself
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
we
be
out
at
Sea
,
the
General
,
accord
to
Instructions
,
open
his
Commission
,
we
be
soon
put
out
of
our
Suspence
,
and
inform'd
,
that
our
order
be
to
attack
Dunkirk
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
so
grand
a
secret
to
those
concern'd
in
the
Expedition
,
have
be
intrust
to
a
female
politician
on
Land
<EOS>
,
it
be
soon
discover'd
to
the
Enemy
;
for
which
Reason
our
order
be
countermand
,
before
we
<EOS>
reach'd
<EOS>
the
Place
of
Action
,
and
our
force
receiv'd
direction
to
land
at
Ostend
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
this
happen'd
that
memorable
battle
at
Steenkirk
,
which
as
very
few
at
that
Time
could
dive
into
the
Reason
of
,
and
mistaken
Accounts
of
it
have
pass'd
for
authentick
,
I
will
mention
somewhat
more
particularly
:
the
Undertaking
be
bold
;
and
,
as
many
thought
,
bold
than
be
consistent
with
the
Character
of
the
wise
Undertaker
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
the
French
have
take
Namure
;
and
,
as
the
Malecontents
alledg'd
,
in
the
very
Sight
of
a
superior
Army
;
and
nothing
have
be
do
by
Land
of
any
moment
,
thing
be
blow
into
such
a
dangerous
fermentation
,
by
a
malicious
and
lie
Spirit
,
that
King
William
find
himself
under
a
necessity
of
attempt
something
that
may
appease
the
Murmurs
of
the
People
.
<EOS>
He
know
very
well
,
though
speak
in
the
Senate
,
that
it
be
not
true
,
that
his
force
at
the
Siege
of
Namure
exceed
those
of
the
Enemy
;
no
man
could
be
more
afflict
than
he
at
the
overflowing
of
the
Mehaigne
,
from
the
continual
Rains
,
which
obstruct
the
Relief
he
have
design
for
that
important
place
;
yet
since
his
Maligners
make
an
ill
Use
of
these
false
topick
,
to
insinuate
that
he
have
no
mind
to
put
an
end
to
the
war
,
he
be
resolv'd
to
evince
the
contrary
,
by
shew
them
that
he
be
not
afraid
to
venture
his
life
for
the
well
obtain
what
be
so
much
desire
.
  
<EOS>
to
that
purpose
,
receive
intelligence
that
the
Duke
of
Luxemburg
lie
strongly
encamp'd
<EOS>
at
Steenkirk
,
near
Enghien
(
tho
'
<EOS>
he
be
sensible
he
must
pass
through
many
defile
to
engage
him
;
and
that
the
many
thicket
between
the
two
Armies
would
frequently
afford
him
new
difficulty
)
<EOS>
he
resolv'd
there
to
attack
him
.
<EOS>
Our
troop
at
first
be
forc'd
to
hew
out
their
passage
for
the
Horse
;
and
there
be
no
one
difficulty
that
his
imagination
have
draw
that
be
lessen'd
by
experience
;
and
yet
so
prosperous
be
his
arm
at
the
beginning
,
that
our
troop
have
make
themselves
master
of
several
piece
of
the
Enemy
's
Cannon
.
<EOS>
but
the
farther
he
advanc'd
,
the
ground
grow
straiter
,
so
strait
as
not
to
admit
his
Army
's
be
draw
up
in
Battalia
,
the
troop
behind
could
not
give
timely
Succour
to
those
engag'd
,
and
the
Cannon
we
have
take
be
forcibly
leave
behind
in
order
to
make
a
good
retreat
.
<EOS>
the
French
have
lose
all
their
courage
in
the
onset
;
for
though
they
have
too
fair
an
opportunity
,
they
do
not
think
fit
to
pursue
it
;
or
,
at
least
,
do
it
very
languidly
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
malecontent
at
Home
,
I
remember
,
grow
very
well
pleas'd
after
this
;
for
so
long
as
they
have
but
a
battle
for
their
money
,
like
true
Englishmen
,
lose
or
win
,
they
be
content
.
  
<EOS>
several
Causes
,
I
remember
,
be
assign'd
for
this
Miscarriage
,
as
they
<EOS>
call'd
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
;
some
there
be
who
be
willing
to
lay
it
upon
the
Dutch
;
and
alledge
a
saying
of
one
of
their
general
,
who
receive
order
to
relieve
some
English
and
Scotch
that
be
over
-
power'd
,
be
hear
to
say
,
<EOS>
Dam
'em
,
since
they
love
fighting
let
'em
have
their
belly
full
.
<EOS>
but
I
should
rather
impute
the
Disappointment
to
the
great
loss
of
so
many
of
our
brave
officer
at
the
very
first
Onset
.
<EOS>
General
Mackay
,
Colonel
Lanier
,
the
Earl
of
Angus
,
with
both
his
field
-
Officers
,
Sir
Robert
Douglas
,
Colonel
Hodges
,
and
many
other
fall
<EOS>
,
it
be
enough
to
put
a
very
considerable
army
into
Confusion
.
<EOS>
I
remember
one
particular
action
of
Sir
Robert
Douglas
,
that
I
should
think
my
self
to
blame
<EOS>
should
I
omit
:
<EOS>
see
his
colour
on
the
other
side
the
Hedge
,
in
the
Hands
of
the
enemy
,
he
leap'd
over
,
slay
the
Officer
that
have
them
,
and
then
throw
them
over
the
Hedge
to
his
company
;
redeem
his
colour
at
the
Expense
of
his
Life
.
<EOS>
thus
the
Scotch
Commander
improv'd
upon
the
Roman
General
;
for
the
brave
Posthumius
cast
his
standard
in
the
middle
of
the
Enemy
for
his
soldier
to
retrieve
,
but
Douglas
retriev'd
his
from
the
Middle
of
the
Enemy
,
without
any
assistance
,
and
cast
it
back
to
his
soldier
to
retain
,
after
he
have
so
bravely
rescue
it
out
of
the
Hands
of
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
from
hence
our
Regiment
receiv'd
order
to
march
to
Dixmuyd
,
where
we
lay
some
time
employ'd
in
fortifying
that
Place
.
<EOS>
while
we
be
there
,
I
have
one
Morning
stedfastly
fix'd
my
eye
upon
some
duck
,
that
be
swim
in
a
large
Water
before
me
;
<EOS>
when
all
on
a
sudden
,
in
the
Midst
of
a
perfect
Calm
,
I
observ'd
<EOS>
such
a
strange
and
strong
agitation
in
the
Waters
,
<EOS>
that
prodigiously
surpriz'd
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
the
same
Moment
seiz'd
with
such
a
Giddiness
in
my
Head
,
that
,
for
a
Minute
or
two
,
I
be
scarce
sensible
,
and
have
much
a
-
do
to
keep
on
my
Legs
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
feel
any
thing
of
an
Earthquake
before
,
which
,
as
I
soon
after
understand
from
other
,
this
be
;
and
it
leave
,
indeed
,
very
apparent
mark
of
its
Force
in
a
great
rent
in
the
Body
of
the
great
Church
,
which
remain
to
this
day
.
  
<EOS>
have
bring
the
intended
fortification
into
some
tolerable
order
,
we
receiv'd
a
Command
out
of
hand
to
reimbarque
for
England
.
<EOS>
and
,
upon
our
landing
,
direction
meet
us
to
march
for
Ipswich
,
where
we
have
our
Quarters
all
that
winter
.
<EOS>
from
thence
we
be
order'd
up
to
London
,
to
do
Duty
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
there
long
,
before
an
Accident
happen'd
,
as
little
to
be
account
for
,
without
a
divine
Providence
,
as
some
would
make
that
Providence
to
be
,
that
only
can
account
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
at
that
Time
,
as
I
be
assur'd
by
my
Lord
Lucas
,
Constable
of
it
,
upwards
of
twenty
Thousand
Barrels
of
Gun
-
powder
,
in
that
they
call
the
White
-
Tower
,
when
all
at
once
the
middle
Flooring
do
not
only
give
way
,
or
shrink
,
but
fall
flat
down
upon
other
Barrels
of
Powder
,
together
with
many
of
the
same
combustible
matter
which
have
be
place
upon
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
Providence
strangely
neglect
at
that
time
,
and
hardly
think
of
since
;
but
let
any
considerate
man
consult
the
Consequences
,
if
it
have
take
fire
;
perhaps
to
the
Destruction
of
the
whole
city
,
or
,
at
least
,
as
far
as
the
Bridge
and
Parts
adjacent
.
<EOS>
let
his
thought
proceed
to
examine
,
why
,
or
how
,
in
that
precipitate
Fall
,
not
one
nail
,
nor
one
Piece
of
Iron
,
in
that
large
Fabrick
,
should
afford
one
little
spark
to
enflame
that
Mass
of
sulphurous
Matter
it
be
load
with
;
and
if
he
be
at
a
loss
to
find
a
Providence
,
I
fear
his
Friends
will
be
more
at
a
loss
to
find
his
understanding
.
<EOS>
but
the
Battle
of
Landen
happen
while
our
Regiment
be
here
on
Duty
,
we
be
soon
remov'd
to
our
Satisfaction
from
that
pacifick
Station
,
to
one
more
active
in
flander
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
that
fatal
Battle
the
Year
precede
,
namely
,
A.D.
1694
,
the
Confederate
Army
under
King
William
lie
encamp'd
<EOS>
at
Mont.
St.
Andre
,
an
open
place
,
and
much
expos'd
;
while
the
French
be
entrench'd
up
to
their
very
tooth
,
at
Vignamont
,
a
little
Distance
from
us
.
<EOS>
this
afford
matter
of
great
reflection
to
the
politician
of
those
time
,
who
could
hardly
allow
,
that
if
the
Confederate
Army
suffer'd
<EOS>
so
much
,
as
it
really
do
in
the
Battle
of
Landen
,
it
could
consist
with
right
conduct
to
tempt
,
or
rather
dare
a
new
Engagement
.
<EOS>
but
those
sage
Objectors
have
forget
the
well
-
know
courage
of
that
brave
Prince
,
and
be
as
little
capable
of
fathom
his
Designs
.
<EOS>
the
Enemy
,
who
to
their
sorrow
have
by
experience
be
make
well
Judges
,
be
resolv'd
to
traverse
both
;
for
which
purpose
they
keep
close
within
their
entrenchment
;
so
that
after
all
his
Efforts
,
King
William
find
he
could
no
way
draw
them
to
a
battle
,
suddenly
decamp'd
,
and
march'd
directly
to
Pont
Espiers
,
by
long
marche
,
with
a
design
to
pass
the
french
line
at
that
place
.
  
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
our
Army
march'd
in
a
direct
line
,
to
our
great
Surprize
,
we
find
the
Enemy
have
first
take
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
give
this
the
name
of
the
Long
March
,
and
very
deservedly
;
for
though
our
Army
march'd
upon
the
String
,
and
the
Enemy
upon
the
Bow
,
sensible
of
the
importance
of
the
Post
,
and
the
necessity
of
secure
it
,
by
double
horseing
with
their
Foot
,
and
by
leave
their
Weary
and
Weak
in
their
garrison
,
and
supply
their
place
with
fresh
man
out
of
them
,
they
gain'd
their
point
in
disappoint
us
.
<EOS>
though
certain
it
be
,
that
March
cost
'em
as
many
Men
and
horse
as
a
Battle
.
<EOS>
however
their
Master
,
the
french
King
,
be
so
pleas'd
with
their
indefatigable
and
auspicious
Diligence
,
that
he
write
,
with
his
own
Hand
,
a
letter
of
thank
to
the
officer
,
for
the
great
Zeal
and
Care
they
have
take
to
prevent
the
Confederate
Army
from
entre
into
french
flander
.
  
<EOS>
King
William
,
thus
disappoint
in
that
noble
Design
,
give
immediate
Orders
for
his
whole
Army
to
march
through
Oudenard
,
and
then
ecamp'd
<EOS>
at
Rofendale
;
after
some
little
stay
at
that
camp
<EOS>
we
be
remov'd
to
the
Camerlins
,
between
Newport
and
Ostend
,
once
more
to
take
our
Winter
Quarters
there
among
the
Boors
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
in
the
Year
1695
when
the
strong
Fortress
of
Namur
,
take
by
the
French
in
1692
and
since
make
by
them
much
strong
,
be
invest
by
the
Earl
of
Athlone
.
<EOS>
after
very
many
vigorous
attack
,
with
the
loss
of
many
man
,
the
Town
be
take
,
the
Garrison
retire
into
the
Castle
.
<EOS>
into
which
soon
after
,
notwithstanding
all
the
Circumspection
of
the
Besiegers
,
Mareschal
Bouflers
find
mean
,
with
some
dragoon
,
to
throw
himself
.
  
<EOS>
while
King
William
be
thus
engag'd
<EOS>
in
that
glorious
and
important
Siege
,
Prince
Vaudemont
be
post
at
Watergaem
,
with
about
fifty
battallion
,
and
as
many
squadron
,
the
Mareschal
Villeroy
lay
a
design
to
attack
him
with
the
whole
French
Army
.
<EOS>
the
Prince
imagin'd
<EOS>
no
less
,
therefore
he
prepar'd
accordingly
,
give
us
Orders
to
fortify
our
camp
,
as
well
as
the
little
time
we
have
for
it
would
permit
.
<EOS>
those
order
be
pursu'd
;
nevertheless
,
I
must
confess
,
it
be
beyond
the
Reach
of
my
little
reason
to
account
for
our
so
long
stay
in
the
Sight
of
an
Army
so
much
superior
to
ours
.
<EOS>
the
Prince
in
the
Whole
could
hardly
muster
thirty
thousand
;
and
Villeroy
be
know
to
value
himself
upon
have
one
hundred
thousand
effective
man
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
Prince
provisionally
send
away
all
our
baggage
that
very
morning
to
Ghent
,
and
still
make
shew
as
if
he
resolv'd
to
defend
himself
to
the
last
extremity
in
our
little
entrenchment
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
on
their
side
begin
to
surround
us
;
and
in
their
motion
for
that
purpose
,
blow
up
little
bag
of
Gun
-
powder
,
to
give
the
ready
Notice
how
far
they
have
acomplish'd
<EOS>
it
.
<EOS>
another
Captain
,
with
my
self
,
be
plac'd
on
the
right
,
with
one
hundred
Men
(
where
I
find
Monsieur
Montal
endeavour
,
if
possible
,
to
get
behind
us
)
<EOS>
I
could
easily
observe
,
they
have
so
far
attain'd
<EOS>
their
Aim
of
encompass
us
,
as
to
the
very
fashion
of
a
Horse
's
Shoe
.
<EOS>
this
make
me
fix
my
eye
so
intently
upon
the
advance
Enemy
,
that
I
never
mind
what
my
friend
be
do
behind
me
;
though
I
afterwards
find
that
they
have
be
file
off
so
very
artfully
and
privately
,
by
that
narrow
Opening
of
the
Horse
-
Shoe
,
that
when
the
enemy
imagin'd
us
past
a
Possibility
of
Escape
,
our
little
Army
at
once
,
and
of
a
sudden
,
be
ready
to
disappear
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
large
wood
on
the
right
of
our
Army
,
through
which
lie
the
Road
to
Ghent
,
not
broad
than
to
admit
of
more
than
Four
to
march
a
breast
.
<EOS>
down
this
the
Prince
have
slide
his
Forces
,
except
to
that
very
small
Party
which
the
captain
and
my
self
command
,
and
which
be
designedly
leave
to
bring
up
the
Rear
.
<EOS>
nor
do
we
stir
till
Captain
Collier
,
then
<EOS>
aid
de
Camp
to
his
brother
,
now
Earl
of
Portmore
,
come
with
the
Word
of
Command
for
us
to
draw
off
.
  
<EOS>
when
Villeroy
be
tell
of
our
retreat
,
he
be
much
surpriz'd
,
as
think
it
a
Thing
utterly
impossible
.
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
,
be
sensible
of
the
Truth
of
it
,
he
give
Orders
for
our
rear
to
be
attack'd
<EOS>
;
but
we
keep
fire
from
Ditch
to
Ditch
,
and
Hedge
to
hedge
,
till
Night
come
upon
us
;
and
so
our
little
Army
get
clear
of
its
gigantick
Enemy
with
very
inconsiderable
loss
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
French
fail'd
not
,
in
their
customary
way
,
to
express
the
Sense
of
their
vexation
,
at
this
Disappointment
,
with
Fire
and
Sword
in
the
Neighbourhood
round
.
<EOS>
thus
Prince
Vaudemont
acquir'd
<EOS>
more
glory
by
that
retreat
than
an
intire
victory
could
have
give
him
;
and
it
be
not
,
I
confess
,
the
least
part
of
Satisfaction
in
Life
,
that
my
self
have
a
share
of
honour
under
him
to
bring
off
the
Rear
at
that
his
glorious
retreat
at
Arfeel
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
in
further
revenge
of
this
political
Chicane
of
the
Prince
of
Vaudemont
,
and
to
oblige
,
if
possible
,
King
William
to
raise
the
Siege
from
before
Namur
,
Villeroy
enter'd
into
the
Resolution
of
Bombarding
Brussells
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
which
he
encamp'd
at
Anderleck
,
and
then
make
his
approach
as
near
as
be
convenient
to
the
Town
.
<EOS>
there
he
caus'd
to
be
plant
thirty
mortar
,
and
rais'd
a
Battery
of
ten
Guns
to
shoot
hot
bullet
into
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
they
fir'd
from
either
,
Villeroy
,
in
complement
to
the
Duke
of
Bavaria
,
send
a
Messenger
to
know
in
what
part
of
the
Town
his
Dutchess
choose
to
reside
,
that
they
may
,
as
much
as
possible
,
avoid
incommode
her
,
by
direct
their
fire
to
other
part
.
<EOS>
Answer
be
return'd
that
she
be
at
her
usual
Place
of
Residence
,
the
Palace
;
and
accordingly
their
fireing
from
Battery
or
Mortars
<EOS>
little
incommode
them
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
five
day
<EOS>
the
bombardment
continu'd
;
and
with
such
fury
,
that
the
Centre
of
that
noble
City
be
quite
lay'd
in
rubbish
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
Time
of
Bombarding
<EOS>
I
be
upon
the
Counterscarp
,
where
I
could
best
see
and
distinguish
;
and
I
have
often
count
in
the
air
,
at
one
time
,
more
than
twenty
bomb
;
for
they
shoot
whole
vollie
out
of
their
mortar
all
together
.
<EOS>
this
,
as
it
must
needs
be
terrible
,
throw
the
inhabitant
into
the
utmost
Confusion
.
<EOS>
cartload
of
Nuns
,
that
for
many
year
before
have
never
be
out
of
the
Cloister
,
be
now
hurry'd
<EOS>
about
from
place
to
Place
,
to
find
retreat
of
some
Security
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
Groves
,
and
part
remote
,
be
all
crowded
;
and
the
most
spacious
Streets
have
hardly
a
Spectator
leave
to
view
their
Ruins
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
to
be
see
like
that
dexterity
of
our
People
in
extinguish
the
fire
;
for
where
the
red
-
hot
Bullets
fall
,
and
rais'd
new
conflagration
,
not
burgher
only
,
but
the
vulgar
Sort
,
stand
stare
,
and
with
their
hand
impockette
,
beheld
their
Houses
gradually
consume
;
and
without
offer
prudent
or
charitable
hand
to
stop
the
grow
flame
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
they
have
almost
thus
destroy'd
that
late
fair
City
,
Villeroy
,
find
he
could
not
raise
the
Siege
of
Namur
,
by
that
vigorous
Attack
upon
Brussels
,
decamp'd
at
last
from
before
it
,
and
put
his
Army
on
the
March
,
to
try
if
he
could
have
well
Success
by
expose
to
show
his
pageant
of
one
hundred
Thousand
Men
.
<EOS>
Prince
Vaudemont
have
timely
intelligence
of
the
Duke
's
Resolution
and
Motion
;
and
resolv'd
,
if
possible
to
get
there
before
him
.
<EOS>
nor
be
the
Attempt
fruitless
:
<EOS>
He
fortunately
succeed
,
though
with
much
fatigue
,
and
no
little
difficulty
,
after
he
have
put
a
Trick
upon
the
spy
of
the
Enemy
,
by
pretend
to
encamp
,
and
so
soon
as
they
be
go
order
a
full
March
.
  
<EOS>
the
Castle
of
Namur
have
be
all
this
time
under
the
Fire
of
the
Besieger

Cannon
;
and
soon
after
our
little
Army
under
the
Prince
be
arriv'd
,
a
Breach
<EOS>
,
that
be
imagin'd
practicable

into
their
Hands
in
1692
and
which
very
much
increas'd
the
Strength
of
the
Whole

<EOS>
a
Breach
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
make
in
this
Terra

a
Storm

in

of

work
,
my
self
command
that
part
of
'em
which
have
be
draw
out
of
Colonel
Tiffins
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
to
rendevouze
at
the
Abbey
of
Salsines
,
under
the
Command
of
the
Lord
Cutts
;
the
Signal
,
when
the
attack
be
to
be
make
,
be
agree
to
be
the
blowing
up
of
a
Bag
of
Gun
-
powder
upon
the
Bridge
of
Boats
that
lie
over
the
Sambre
.
  
<EOS>
so
soon
as
the
Signal
be
make
,
we
march'd
up
to
the
Breach
with
a
decent
intrepidity
,
receive
all
the
way
we
advanc'd
<EOS>
the
full
Fire
of
the
Cohorn
Fort
.
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
we
come
near
enough
to
mount
,
we
find
it
vastly
steep
and
rugged
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
which
,
several
do
get
up
,
and
enter'd
<EOS>
the
Breach
;
but
not
be
support
as
they
ought
to
have
be
,
they
be
all
make
prisoner
.
<EOS>
which
,
together
with
a
Wound
my
Lord
Cutts
receiv'd
,
after
he
have
do
all
that
be
possible
for
us
,
necessitate
us
to
retire
with
the
loss
of
many
of
our
Men

<EOS>
VILLEROY
all
this
while
lie
in
fight
,
with
his
Army
of
one
hundred
Thousand
Men
,
without
make
the
least
offer
to
incommode
the
Besiegers
;
or
even
without
do
any
thing
more
than
make
his
appearance
in
favour
of
the
Besieged
,
and
reconnoitre
our
Encampment
:
<EOS>
and
,
at
last
,
see
,
or
imagine
that
he
see
,
the
Attempt
would
be
to
little
purpose
,
with
all
the
good
Manners
in
the
World
,
<EOS>
in
the
Night
,
he
withdraw
that
terrible
Meteor
,
and
reliev'd
our
poor
horse
from
feed
on
Leaves
,
the
only
Inconvenience
he
have
put
us
to
.
  
<EOS>
this
retreat
leave
the
Garrison
without
all
Hope
of
Relief
,
they
in
the
Castle
immediately
capitulate
.
<EOS>
but
after
one
of
the
Gates
have
be
,
accord
to
Articles
,
deliver
up
and
Count
Guiscard
be
march
out
at
the
Head
of
the
Garrison
,
and
Bouflers
at
the
Head
of
the
Dragoons
;
the
latter
be
,
by
order
of
King
William
,
arrest
,
in
reprize
of
the
Garrison
of
Dixmuyd
(
who
,
contrary
to
the
Cartel
,
have
be
detain'd
Prisoners
)
and
remain'd
under
arrest
till
they
be
set
free
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
Year
1696
be
discover'd
<EOS>
a
Plot
,
fit
only
to
have
have
its
Origin
from
Hell
or
Rome
.
<EOS>
a
Plot
,
which
would
have
put
Hottentots
and
barbarian
out
of
Countenance
.
<EOS>
this
be
call'd
the
Assassination
Plot
,
from
the
design
of
it
,
which
be
to
have
assassinate
King
William
a
little
before
the
time
of
his
usual
leave
England
to
head
the
Army
of
the
Confederates
in
flander
.
<EOS>
and
as
nothing
could
give
a
noble
idea
of
the
great
character
of
that
Prince
than
such
a
nefarious
combination
against
him
;
so
,
with
all
considerate
man
,
nothing
could
more
depreciate
the
cause
of
his
inconsiderate
enemy
.
<EOS>
if
I
remember
what
I
have
read
,
the
son
of
ancient
Rome
,
though
heathen
,
behav'd
themselves
against
an
Enemy
in
a
quite
different
manner
.
<EOS>
Their
Historians
afford
us
more
instance
than
a
few
of
their
generous
intimation
to
Kings
and
Generals
,
under
actual
Hostilities
,
of
barbarous
design
upon
their
life
.
<EOS>
I
proceed
to
this
of
our
own
Countrymen
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
the
Discovery
have
be
make
,
by
person
<EOS>
actually
engag'd
<EOS>
in
that
inhuman
Design
,
the
Regiment
,
in
which
I
serve
,
with
some
other
then
in
flander
,
receiv'd
Orders
,
with
all
Expedition
,
to
embarque
for
England
;
though
,
on
our
arrival
at
gravesend
,
fresh
order
meet
us
to
remain
on
board
the
Transports
,
till
we
have
surther
direction
.
  
<EOS>
on
my
go
to
London
,
a
few
day
after
,
I
be
tell
,
that
two
Regiments
only
be
now
design'd
to
come
a
-
shore
;
and
that
the
rest
would
be
remand
to
flander
,
the
Danger
apprehend
be
pretty
well
over
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
White
Hall
when
I
receiv'd
this
Notice
;
<EOS>
where
meet
my
Lord
Cutts
(
who
have
ever
since
the
storming
of
the
Terra
Nova
at
Namur
<EOS>
allow'd
<EOS>
me
a
share
in
his
Favour
)
<EOS>
he
express'd
<EOS>
himself
in
the
most
obliging
manner
;
and
at
part
<EOS>
desir'd
<EOS>
he
may
not
fail
of
see
me
next
morning
at
his
House
;
for
he
have
somewhat
of
an
extraordinary
nature
to
communicate
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
time
appoint
,
I
wait
on
his
Lorship
,
where
I
meet
Mr.
Steel
(
now
Sir
Richard
,
and
at
that
time
his
Secretary
)
who
immediately
introduc'd
me
.
<EOS>
I
find
in
company
with
him
three
gentleman
;
and
after
common
salutation
,
his
lordship
deliver'd
into
my
Hands
,
an
order
from
the
King
in
Council
to
go
along
with
Captain
Porter
,
Mr.
de
la
Rue
,
and
Mr.
George
Harris
(
<EOS>
who
prov'd
to
be
those
three
with
him
)
to
search
all
the
Transports
at
Gravesend
,
in
order
to
prevent
any
of
the
Conspirators
get
out
of
England
that
Way
.
<EOS>
after
answer
,
that
I
be
ready
to
pay
obedience
,
and
receiving
,
in
private
,
the
further
necessary
Instructions
,
we
take
our
leave
,
and
oar
soon
after
for
Gravesend
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
in
our
passage
down
,
that
I
understand
that
they
have
all
be
of
the
Conspiracy
,
but
now
reluctant
,
be
become
witness
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
Gravesend
,
I
produc'd
<EOS>
my
authority
to
the
Commanding
Officer
,
who
very
readily
pay
Obedience
,
and
give
assistance
;
<EOS>
but
after
our
most
diligent
search
,
find
nothing
of
what
we
look'd
<EOS>
for
,
we
return'd
<EOS>
that
very
night
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
Next
Day
a
Proclamation
be
to
come
out
for
the
apprehending
three
of
four
trooper
,
who
be
send
over
by
King
James
,
with
a
thousand
Pounds
Reward
for
each
:
<EOS>
Mr.
George
Harris
,
who
be
the
fourth
,
be
the
only
evidence
against
the
other
three
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
we
return'd
from
Gravesend
,
but
Harris
have
Intelligence
bring
him
,
that
Cassells
,
one
of
the
three
,
be
at
Mr.
Allens
in
the
Savoy
,
under
the
name
of
Green
.
<EOS>
upon
which
we
go
directly
to
the
place
;
and
enquire
for
Mr.
Green
,
we
be
tell
he
lodg'd
there
,
and
be
in
his
Room
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
oblig'd
<EOS>
by
my
order
to
go
along
with
them
,
and
assist
'em
;
and
very
well
be
it
that
I
be
so
<EOS>
:
for
in
consideration
of
the
reward
in
the
Proclamation
,
which
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
to
come
out
the
next
Day
,
Harris
and
the
rest
be
for
defer
his
Seizure
,
till
the
come
out
of
that
proclamation
;
but
make
answer
,
that
in
case
of
his
Escape
that
Night
,
I
must
be
responsible
to
my
superior
;
who
,
under
the
most
favourable
Aspect
,
would
construe
it
a
Neglect
of
Duty
,
they
be
forc'd
to
comply
;
and
so
he
be
take
up
,
and
his
name
that
Night
strike
out
of
the
Proclamation
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
true
,
by
this
faithful
discharge
of
my
Trust
,
I
do
save
the
Government
one
thousand
Pounds
;
but
it
be
equally
so
,
that
I
never
have
of
my
Governors
one
farthe
consideration
for
what
other
term'd
<EOS>
an
over
-
officious
Piece
of
Service
;
though
in
Justice
it
must
be
own'd
a
Piece
of
exact
and
disintereste
Duty
.
  
<EOS>
some
few
day
after
,
attend
by
Direction
at
the
Secretary
's
Office
,
with
Mr.
Harris
,
there
come
in
a
dutchman
,
splutter
and
make
a
great
noise
,
that
he
be
sure
he
could
discover
one
of
the
Conspirators
;
but
the
Mein
and
the
Behaviour
of
the
Man
,
would
not
give
any
Body
Leave
to
give
him
any
Credit
or
Regard
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
Man
persist
in
his
assertion
,
I
speak
to
Mr.
Harris
to
take
him
aside
,
and
ask
him
what
sort
of
a
person
he
be
;
<EOS>
Harris
do
so
;
and
the
Dutchman
describe
him
,
say
Harris
,
return
to
me
,
I
will
be
<EOS>
hang'd
<EOS>
if
it
be
not
Blackburn
.
<EOS>
upon
which
we
have
him
question'd
somewhat
more
narrowly
;
when
have
no
room
to
doubt
,
and
understanding
where
he
be
,
Colonel
Rivet
of
the
Guards
be
send
for
,
and
order'd
to
go
along
with
us
to
seize
him
.
<EOS>
We
go
accordingly
;
and
it
prove
to
be
Blackburn
,
the
Dutchman
have
five
hundred
Pounds
,
and
the
Colonel
and
other
the
Remainder
.
<EOS>
Cassels
and
Blackburn
,
if
still
alive
,
be
in
Newgate
,
confin'd
by
Act
of
Parliament
,
one
only
Witness
,
which
be
Harris
,
be
producible
against
them
.
  
<EOS>
when
Blackburn
be
seiz'd
,
I
find
in
the
Chamber
with
him
,
one
Davison
,
a
Watch
-
maker
,
live
in
Holbourn
.
<EOS>
I
carry'd
him
along
with
me
to
the
Secretary
of
State
;
but
nothing
on
his
examination
appear
against
him
,
he
be
immediately
<EOS>
discharg'd
.
<EOS>
He
offer'd
afterwards
to
present
me
with
a
fine
Watch
of
his
own
making
,
which
I
refus'd
;
and
he
long
after
own'd
the
Obligation
.
  
<EOS>
so
soon
as
the
depth
of
this
Plot
be
fathom'd
,
and
<EOS>
the
intend
Evil
provide
against
,
as
well
as
prevent
,
King
William
go
over
into
flander
,
and
our
Regiment
thereupon
receiv'd
<EOS>
order
for
their
immediate
Return
.
<EOS>
nothing
of
any
Moment
occurr'd
<EOS>
till
our
arrival
at
our
old
Quarters
,
the
Camerlins
,
where
we
lay
dispers'd
amongst
the
Country
Boors
or
Farmers
,
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
however
,
for
our
well
Security
in
those
Quarters
,
and
to
preserve
us
from
the
Excursions
of
the
neighbour
Garrison
of
Furnes
,
we
be
oblig'd
to
keep
an
Out
-
guard
at
a
little
Place
call'd
Shoerbeck
.
<EOS>
this
Guard
be
every
forty
-
eight
hour
chang'd
,
and
remount
with
a
Captain
,
a
Lieutenant
,
an
ensign
,
and
threescore
man
.
  
<EOS>
when
it
come
to
my
turn
to
relieve
that
Guard
,
and
for
that
purpose
I
be
arriv'd
at
my
Post
,
it
appear'd
to
me
with
the
face
of
a
Place
of
Debauch
,
rather
than
business
;
there
be
too
visible
token
,
that
the
hard
duty
of
both
officer
and
Soldiers
have
be
that
of
hard
Drinking
,
the
foul
error
that
a
soldier
can
commit
,
especially
when
on
his
Guard
.
  
<EOS>
to
confirm
my
Apprehensions
,
a
little
after
I
have
take
Possession
of
my
Guard
,
the
Man
of
the
House
relate
to
me
such
passage
,
and
so
many
of'em
,
that
satisfy'd
me
,
that
if
ten
sober
Men
have
make
the
attack
,
they
may
have
fairly
knock'd
<EOS>
all
my
predecessor
of
the
last
Guard
on
the
Head
,
without
much
difficulty
.
<EOS>
however
,
his
Account
administer'd
matter
of
caution
to
me
,
and
put
me
upon
take
a
narrow
view
of
our
situation
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
whereof
,
at
Night
I
plac'd
a
Centinel
a
quarter
of
a
Mile
in
the
rear
,
and
such
other
Centinels
as
I
think
necessary
and
convenient
in
other
Places
;
with
order
,
that
upon
Sight
of
an
Enemy
the
Centinel
near
should
fire
;
and
that
upon
hear
that
,
all
the
other
Centinels
,
as
well
as
he
,
should
hasten
in
to
strengthen
our
Main
Guard
.
  
<EOS>
what
my
jealousy
,
on
my
Landlord
's
relation
,
have
suggest
,
happen'd
<EOS>
accordingly
:
for
about
one
in
the
morning
I
be
alarm'd
<EOS>
with
the
Cry
of
one
of
my
Centinels
,
turn
out
for
God
's
sake
;
which
he
repeat
,
with
Vehemence
,
three
or
four
time
over
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
Alarm
,
get
up
suddenly
;
and
with
no
little
difficulty
get
my
man
into
their
rank
,
when
the
person
who
make
the
Outcry
come
run
in
,
almost
spend
,
and
out
of
Breath
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
Centinel
,
that
I
have
luckily
plac'd
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
,
who
give
the
Alarm
,
and
his
Musket
flash
in
the
Pan
,
without
go
off
,
he
endeavour'd
to
supply
with
his
Voice
the
Defect
of
his
Piece
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
get
my
man
into
their
rank
,
in
order
to
receive
the
Enemy
,
<EOS>
when
by
the
Moonlight
,
I
discover'd
a
Party
advance
upon
us
.
<EOS>
My
out
centinel
challeng'd
'em
,
and
as
I
have
precaution'd
,
they
answer'd
,
Hispanioli
;
though
I
know
'em
to
be
french
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
on
my
survey
of
our
situation
by
day
-
light
,
have
mark'd
<EOS>
in
my
mind
<EOS>
a
proper
place
for
draw
up
my
Men
in
Case
of
an
Attack
,
which
be
too
narrow
to
admit
of
more
than
two
on
a
breast
;
and
which
would
secure
between
us
and
the
Enemy
a
Ditch
of
Water
<EOS>
:
I
resolv'd
to
put
in
practice
what
have
entertain'd
me
so
well
in
the
theory
.
<EOS>
to
that
purpose
<EOS>
I
order'd
<EOS>
my
first
Rank
to
keep
their
Post
,
stand
still
and
face
the
Enemy
,
while
the
other
two
Ranks
stoop
should
follow
me
to
gain
the
intended
Station
;
which
do
,
the
first
Rank
have
order
to
file
off
and
fall
behind
.
<EOS>
all
be
perform'd
in
excellent
order
;
and
I
confess
it
be
with
no
little
Pleasure
,
that
I
beheld
the
Enemy
,
for
the
good
part
of
an
hour
,
in
consultation
whether
they
should
attack
us
or
no
.
<EOS>
the
result
,
nevertheless
,
of
that
consultation
end
in
this
;
that
,
see
us
so
well
upon
our
Guard
,
it
be
most
adviseable
to
draw
off
.
<EOS>
They
soon
put
their
resolution
into
practice
,
which
I
be
very
glad
to
see
;
on
Examination
a
little
before
have
find
that
my
Predecessor
,
as
in
other
thing
,
have
fail'd
of
conduct
in
leave
me
a
Garrison
without
Ammunition
.
  
<EOS>
Next
Morning
I
be
very
pleasingly
surpriz'd
with
a
handsome
Present
of
Wine
,
and
some
other
necessary
Refreshments
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
make
a
little
Scruple
and
Hesitation
whether
or
no
to
receive
'em
;
till
the
Bearer
<EOS>
assur'd
<EOS>
me
,
that
they
be
send
me
from
the
Officers
of
the
next
Garrison
,
who
have
make
me
a
visit
the
night
before
,
as
a
candid
Acknowledgment
of
my
conduct
and
good
Behaviour
.
<EOS>
I
return'd
their
Compliment
,
that
I
hop'd
I
should
never
receive
Men
of
Honour
otherwise
than
like
a
Man
of
Honour
;
which
mightily
pleas'd
them
.
<EOS>
every
of
which
particular
the
Ghent
Gazettier
the
Week
after
publish'd
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
little
to
do
except
Marching
and
counter
-
march
all
the
campaign
after
;
till
it
be
resolv'd
in
a
Council
of
War
,
for
the
well
preserving
of
Brussels
from
such
Insults
,
as
it
have
before
sustain'd
from
the
French
,
during
the
Siege
of
Namur
,
to
fortify
Anderlech
;
upon
which
our
Regiment
,
as
well
as
other
,
be
command
from
our
more
pacifick
post
to
attend
that
work
.
<EOS>
Our
whole
Army
be
under
Movement
to
cover
that
resolution
;
and
the
train
fall
to
my
Care
and
Command
in
the
March
.
<EOS>
there
accompany'd
<EOS>
the
train
a
Fellow
,
seemingly
ordinary
,
yet
very
officious
and
courteous
,
be
ready
to
do
any
thing
for
any
Person
,
from
the
Officer
to
the
common
soldier
.
<EOS>
He
travell'd
along
and
mov'd
with
the
train
,
sometimes
on
Foot
,
and
sometimes
get
a
ride
in
some
one
or
other
of
the
Waggons
;
but
ever
full
of
his
chit
-
chat
and
story
of
Humour
.
<EOS>
by
these
insinuating
way
he
have
screw'd
<EOS>
himself
into
the
general
good
Opinion
;
but
the
Waggoners
especially
grow
particularly
fond
of
him
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
our
March
all
our
Powder
-
Waggons
be
plac'd
breast
a
-
breast
,
and
so
close
,
that
one
miscarry
would
leave
little
doubt
of
the
Fate
of
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
this
in
the
Camp
we
commonly
call
the
Park
;
and
here
it
be
that
our
new
Guest
,
like
another
Phaeton
,
though
under
Pretence
of
Weariness
,
not
Ambition
,
get
Leave
of
the
very
last
Carter
to
the
train
to
take
a
Nap
in
his
Waggon
.
<EOS>
one
who
have
entertain'd
a
jealousy
of
him
,
and
have
watch'd
<EOS>
him
,
give
information
against
him
;
upon
which
he
be
seiz'd
and
bring
to
me
as
Captain
of
the
Guard
.
<EOS>
I
caus'd
him
to
be
<EOS>
search'd
;
and
upon
search
,
finding
match
,
Touchwood
,
and
other
dangerous
material
upon
him
;
I
send
him
and
them
away
to
the
Provoe
.
<EOS>
upon
the
Whole
,
a
Council
of
War
be
call'd
,
at
which
,
upon
a
strict
Examination
,
he
confess'd
himself
a
hir'd
Incendiary
;
and
as
such
receiv'd
<EOS>
his
sentence
to
be
burn
in
the
face
of
the
Army
.
<EOS>
the
Execution
be
a
day
or
two
after
:
when
on
the
very
spot
,
he
further
acknowledge
,
that
on
Sight
or
Noise
of
the
Blow
,
it
have
be
concert
,
that
the
french
Army
should
fall
upon
the
confederate
under
those
lamentable
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
the
Peace
of
Riswick
soon
after
take
place
,
put
an
end
to
all
Incendiarisms
of
either
sort
.
<EOS>
so
that
nothing
of
a
Military
Kind
,
which
be
now
become
my
Province
,
happen'd
<EOS>
of
some
year
after
.
<EOS>
Our
Regiment
be
first
order'd
into
England
;
and
presently
after
into
Ireland
:
<EOS>
but
as
these
Memoirs
be
not
design'd
for
the
Low
Amuzement
of
a
Tea
-
Table
,
but
rather
of
the
Cabinet
,
a
Series
of
inglorious
Inactivity
can
furnish
but
very
little
towards
'em
.
  
<EOS>
yet
as
little
as
I
admir'd
a
Life
of
Inactivity
,
there
be
some
Sorts
of
Activity
,
to
which
a
wise
Man
may
almost
give
Supineness
the
Preference
:
<EOS>
such
be
that
of
barely
encountre
element
,
and
wage
War
with
Nature
;
and
such
,
in
my
opinion
,
would
have
be
the
spending
my
Commission
,
and
very
probably
my
life
with
it
,
in
the
West
Indies
.
<EOS>
for
though
the
Climate
(
as
some
would
urge
)
may
afford
a
Chance
for
a
very
speedy
advance
in
Honour
,
yet
,
upon
revolve
in
my
mind
,
that
those
rotation
of
the
Wheel
of
Fortune
be
often
so
very
quick
,
as
well
as
uncertain
,
that
I
my
self
may
as
well
be
the
first
as
the
last
;
the
Whole
of
the
debate
end
in
somewhat
like
that
Couplet
of
the
excellent
Hudibras
:
  
<EOS>
then
he
,
that
run
away
and
flee
,
Must
lie
in
Honour
's
Truckle
-
bed
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
my
well
planet
soon
disannull'd
<EOS>
those
melancholy
Ideas
,
which
a
rumour
of
our
be
send
into
the
West
Indies
have
crowd
my
Head
and
Heart
with
:
for
be
call'd
over
into
England
,
upon
the
very
Affairs
of
the
Regiment
,
I
arriv'd
there
just
after
the
Orders
for
their
transportation
go
over
;
by
which
mean
the
Choice
of
go
be
put
out
of
my
power
,
and
the
Danger
of
Refusing
,
which
be
the
Case
of
many
,
be
very
luckily
avoid
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
judg'd
,
therefore
,
impossible
for
me
to
return
soon
enough
to
gain
my
passage
,
one
in
Power
propos'd
to
me
,
that
I
should
resign
to
an
Officer
then
go
over
;
and
with
some
other
contingent
Advantages
,
to
my
great
satisfaction
,
I
be
put
upon
the
half
-
pay
list
.
<EOS>
this
be
more
agreeable
,
for
I
know
,
or
at
least
imagin'd
<EOS>
my
self
wise
enough
to
foretel
,
from
the
over
hot
debate
of
the
House
of
Commons
upon
the
Partition
Treaty
,
that
it
could
not
be
long
before
the
present
peace
would
,
at
least
,
require
patching
.
  
<EOS>
under
this
sort
of
uncertain
settlement
I
remain'd
with
the
Patience
of
a
Jew
,
though
not
with
Judaical
Absurdity
,
a
faithful
Adherer
to
my
expectation
.
<EOS>
nor
do
the
Consequence
fail
of
answering
<EOS>
,
a
War
be
apparent
,
and
soon
after
proclaim'd
.
<EOS>
thus
wait
for
an
opportunity
,
which
I
flatter'd
my
self
would
soon
present
,
the
little
diversion
of
Dublin
,
and
the
moderate
Conversation
of
that
People
,
be
not
of
Temptation
enough
to
make
my
stay
in
England
look
like
a
Burden
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
the
war
be
proclaim'd
,
and
Preparations
accordingly
make
for
it
,
the
expectation
from
all
receiv'd
<EOS>
a
sudden
Damp
,
by
the
as
sudden
death
of
King
William
.
<EOS>
that
Prince
,
who
have
stare
death
in
the
face
in
many
Sieges
and
Battles
,
meet
with
his
Fate
in
the
Midst
of
his
diversion
,
who
seiz'd
his
Prize
in
an
hour
,
to
human
Thought
,
the
least
adapt
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
hunting
(
his
customary
diversion
)
<EOS>
when
,
by
an
unhappy
Trip
of
his
Horse
,
he
fall
to
the
ground
;
and
in
the
fall
displac'd
his
collar
-
bone
.
<EOS>
the
News
of
it
immediately
alarm'd
<EOS>
the
Court
,
and
all
around
;
and
the
sad
effect
of
it
soon
after
give
all
Europe
the
like
Alarm

<EOS>
France
only
,
who
have
not

seek
it
sooner
by
ungenerous
Means
,
receiv'd
<EOS>
new
Hope
,
from
what
give
other
motive
for
despair

<EOS>
He
flatter'd
himself
,
that
that
long
liv'd
Obstacle
to
his
Ambition
thus
remov'd
,
his
Successor
would
never
fall
into
those
measure

which
he
have
wisely
concert
for
the
Liberties

on
the
Rhine
,
I
be
resolv'd
to
make
a
push
for
it
the
first
opportunity
,
and
waste
my
Minutes
no
longer
on
Court
Attendances
.
<EOS>
and
my
Lord
Cutts
return
with
his
full
share
of
Laurels
,
for
his
never
to
be
forget
service
at
Venlo
,
Ruremond
,
and
Hochstet
,
find
his
active
Genius
now
to
be
repos'd
,
under
the
less
agreeable
Burden
of
unhazardous
Honour
,
where
Quiet
must
provide
a
Tomb
for
one
already
past
any
Danger
of
Oblivion
;
deep
wound
and
glorious
action
have
anticipate
all
that
could
be
say
in
Epitaphs
or
litteral
Inscriptions
.
<EOS>
soon
after
his
arrival
from
Germany
,
he
be
appoint
General
of
all
her
Majesty
's
Forces
in
Ireland
;
upon
which
go
to
congratulate
him
,
he
be
pleas'd
to
enquire
of
me
several
thing
relate
to
that
country
;
and
particularly
in
what
part
of
Dublin
I
would
recommend
his
residence
;
offer
at
the
same
time
,
if
I
would
go
over
with
him
,
all
the
Services
that
should
fall
in
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
but
inactivity
be
a
thing
I
have
too
long
lament
;
therefore
,
after
I
have
,
as
decently
as
I
could
,
declin'd
<EOS>
the
latter
part
,
I
tell
his
lordship
,
that
as
to
a
Place
of
Residence
,
I
be
Master
of
a
House
in
Dublin
,
large
enough
,
and
suitable
to
his
great
quality
,
which
should
be
at
his
Service
,
on
any
term
he
think
fit
.
<EOS>
add
withal
,
that
I
have
a
mind
to
see
Spain
,
where
my
Lord
Peterborow
be
now
go
;
and
that
if
his
lordship
would
favour
me
with
a
recommendation
,
it
would
suit
my
present
inclination
much
well
than
any
further
tedious
Recess
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
be
so
good
to
close
with
both
my
Overtures
;
and
speak
so
effectually
in
my
Favour
,
that
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
then
General
of
all
the
Forces
order'd
on
that
Expedition
,
bad
me
speedily
prepare
my
self
;
and
so
when
all
thing
be
ready
<EOS>
I
embarqu'd
<EOS>
with
that
noble
Lord
for
Spain
,
to
pursue
his
well
concerted
Undertaking
;
which
,
in
the
Event
,
will
demonstrate
to
the
World
,
that
little
Armies
,
under
the
Conduct
of
auspicious
Generals
,
may
sometimes
produce
prodigious
effect
.
  
<EOS>
the
Jews
,
in
whatever
part
of
the
World
,
be
a
People
industrious
in
the
increasing
of
Mammon
;
and
be
accustom'd
<EOS>
to
the
universal
Methods
of
Gain
,
be
always
esteem'd
good
qualify'd
for
any
Undertaking
,
where
that
bear
a
probability
of
be
a
Perquisite
.
<EOS>
provide
Bread
,
and
other
Requisites
for
an
Army
,
be
ever
allow'd
<EOS>
to
carry
along
with
it
a
profit
answerable
;
and
Spain
be
not
the
first
Country
where
that
People
have
engag'd
in
such
an
Undertaking
.
<EOS>
besides
,
on
any
likely
appearance
of
great
advantage
,
it
be
in
the
Nature
as
well
as
Practice
of
that
race
,
strenuously
to
assist
one
another
;
and
that
with
the
utmost
confidence
and
prodigious
Alacrity
.
<EOS>
one
of
that
Number
,
both
competent
and
willing
enough
to
carry
on
an
undertaking
of
that
kind
,
fortunately
come
at
that
Juncture
to
solicit
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
to
be
employ'd
as
proveditor
to
the
Army
and
Troops
,
which
be
,
or
should
be
send
into
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
easily
be
admit
,
that
the
Earl
,
under
his
present
exigency
,
do
not
decline
to
listen
.
<EOS>
and
a
very
considerable
Sum
be
offer'd
,
by
way
of
Advance
,
the
Method
common
in
like
case
be
pursu'd
,
and
the
Sum
propos'd
accept
;
by
which
mean
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
find
himself
put
into
the
happy
capacity
of
proceed
upon
his
first
concerted
Project
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
the
Jew
,
who
sign'd
the
contract
,
be
Curtisos
;
and
he
and
his
Friends
,
with
great
Punctuality
,
advanc'd
<EOS>
the
expect
Sum
of
one
hundred
Thousand
Pounds
sterling
,
or
very
near
it
;
which
be
immediately
order'd
into
the
Hands
of
the
pay

master
of
the
Forces
.
<EOS>
for
though
the
Earl
take
money
of
the
Jews
,
it
be
not
for
his
own
,
but
public
Use
.
<EOS>

upon
the
Lord
Godolphin
(
then
Lord
Treasurer
)
<EOS>
all
which
be
,
on
that
Occasion
,
punctually
comply'd
with
.
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
peterborow
have
thus
fortunately
find
mean
to
supply
himself
with
money
,
and
by
that
with
some
Horse
,
after
he
have
obtain'd
Leave
of
the
Lord
Galoway
to
make
an
Exchange
of
two
Regiments
of
Foot
,
receiv'd
the
Arch
-
Duke
,
and
all
those
who
would
follow
him
,
aboard
the
Fleet
;
and
,
at
his
own
Expense
,
transport
him
and
his
whole
retinue
to
Barcelona
:
for
all
which
prodigious
Charge
,
as
I
have
be
very
lately
inform'd
,
from
very
good
Hands
,
<EOS>
that
noble
Earl
never
to
this
day
receiv'd
<EOS>
any
consideration
from
the
Government
,
or
any
person
whatsoever
.
  
<EOS>
We
sail'd
from
Lisbon
,
in
order
to
join
the
Squadron
under
Sir
Cloudsley
Shovel
:
meet
with
which
at
the
appoint
Station
off
Tangier
,
the
Men
of
War
and
Transports
thus
unite
,
make
the
good
of
their
Way
for
Gibraltar
.
<EOS>
there
we
stay'd
no
longer
than
to
take
aboard
two
regiment
out
of
that
Garrison
,
in
lieu
of
two
out
of
our
Fleet
.
<EOS>
here
we
find
the
Prince
of
Hesse
,
who
immediately
take
a
resolution
to
follow
the
Arch
-
Duke
in
this
Expedition
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
person
of
great
gallantry
;
and
have
be
Vice
-
Roy
of
Catalonia
,
be
receiv'd
on
board
the
Fleet
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
,
as
be
a
person
capable
of
do
great
Service
in
a
country
where
he
be
well
know
,
and
as
well
belov'd
.
  
<EOS>
speak
Latin
then
pretty
fluently
,
it
give
me
frequent
opportunie
of
converse
with
the
two
Father
Confessors
of
the
Duke
of
Austria
;
and
upon
that
account
I
find
my
self
honour'd
with
some
share
in
the
Favour
of
the
Arch
-
Duke
himself
.
<EOS>
I
mention
this
,
not
to
gratify
any
vain
Humour
,
but
as
a
corroborate
Circumstance
,
that
my
Opportunities
of
Information
,
in
matter
of
Consequence
,
could
not
thereby
be
suppos'd
to
be
lessen'd
;
but
that
I
may
more
reasonably
be
imagin'd
to
arrive
at
Intelligence
,
that
not
very
often
,
or
at
least
not
so
soon
,
come
to
the
knowledge
of
other
.
  
<EOS>
from
Gibraltar
we
sail'd
to
the
Bay
of
Altea
,
not
far
distant
from
the
City
of
Valencia
,
in
the
Road
of
which
we
continu'd
for
some
day
.
<EOS>
while
we
be
there
,
as
I
be
very
credibly
inform'd
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
meet
with
some
fresh
disappointment
;
but
what
it
be
,
neither
I
nor
any
body
else
,
as
far
as
I
could
perceive
,
could
ever
dive
into
:
neither
do
it
appear
by
any
outward
Tokens
,
in
that
noble
General
,
that
it
lie
so
much
at
his
Heart
,
as
those
about
him
seem'd
to
assure
me
it
do
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
while
we
lay
in
Altea
Bay
,
two
Bomb
-
Vessels
,
and
a
small
Squadron
,
be
order'd
against
Denia
,
which
have
a
small
castle
;
but
rather
fine
than
strong
.
<EOS>
and
accordingly
,
upon
our
offer
to
bring
to
bear
with
our
Cannon
,
and
prepare
to
fix
our
Bomb
-
Vessels
,
in
order
to
bombard
the
Place
,
it
surrender'd
;
and
acknowledg'd
the
Arch
-
Duke
as
lawful
king
of
Spain
,
and
so
proclaim'd
him
.
<EOS>
from
this
time
,
therefore
,
speak
of
that
Prince
,
it
shall
be
under
that
Title
.
<EOS>
General
Ramos
be
leave
Commander
here
;
a
person
who
afterwards
act
a
very
extraordinary
part
in
the
war
carry'd
on
in
the
Kingdom
of
Valencia
.
  
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
no
positive
Resolutions
have
be
take
for
the
Operations
of
the
campaign
,
before
the
Arch
Duke
's
departure
from
Lisbon
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
ever
solicitous
of
the
Honour
of
his
Country
,
have
premeditate
another
Enterprize
,
which
,
have
it
be
embrac'd
,
<EOS>
would
in
all
probability
,
have
bring
that
War
to
a
much
more
speedy
conclusion
;
and
at
the
same
time
have
obviate
all
those
difficulty
,
which
be
but
too
apparent
in
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
.
<EOS>
He
have
justly
and
judiciously
weigh'd
,
that
there
be
no
force
in
the
Middle
Parts
of
Spain
,
all
their
troop
be
in
the
extream
Parts
of
the
Kingdom
,
either
on
the
Frontiers
of
Portugal
,
or
in
the
City
of
Barcelona
;
that
with
King
Philip
,
and
the
royal
Family
at
Madrid
,
there
be
only
some
few
Horse
,
and
those
in
a
bad
condition
,
and
which
only
serv'd
for
Guards
:
if
therefore
,
as
he
rightly
project
within
himself
,
by
the
taking
of
Valencia
,
or
any
Sea
-
Port
Town
,
that
may
have
secur'd
<EOS>
his
landing
,
he
have
march'd
<EOS>
directly
for
Madrid
;
what
could
have
oppos'd
him
?
<EOS>
but
I
shall
have
occasion
to
dilate
more
upon
this
Head
a
few
page
hence
;
and
therefore
shall
here
only
say
,
that
though
that
Project
of
his
may
have
bring
about
a
speedy
and
wonderful
revolution
,
what
he
be
by
his
Orders
afterwards
<EOS>
oblig'd
to
,
against
his
Inclinations
,
to
pursue
,
contribute
much
more
to
his
great
reputation
,
as
it
put
him
under
a
frequent
necessity
of
overcome
difficulty
,
which
,
to
any
other
General
,
would
have
appear'd
unsurmountable
.
  
<EOS>
VALENCIA
be
a
city
towards
the
Centre
of
Spain
,
to
the
Seaward
,
seat
in
a
rich
and
most
populous
Country
,
just
fifty
league
from
Madrid
.
<EOS>
It
abound
in
horse
and
Mules
;
by
reason
of
the
great
fertility
of
its
Lands
,
which
they
can
,
to
great
advantage
,
water
when
,
and
as
they
please
.
<EOS>
this
City
and
Kingdom
be
as
much
inclin'd
<EOS>
to
the
Interest
of
King
Charles
as
Catalonia
<EOS>
it
self
;
for
even
on
our
first
appearance
,
great
number
of
People
come
down
to
the
Bay
of
Altea
,
with
not
only
a
bare
offer
of
their
service
,
but
load
with
all
Manner
of
provision
,
and
loud
acclamation
of
Viva
Carlos
tercero
,
Viva
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
regular
troop
in
any
of
the
Places
round
about
it
,
or
in
the
City
it
self
.
<EOS>
the
near
be
those
few
Horse
in
Madrid
,
one
hundred
and
fifty
mile
distant
;
nor
any
Foot
near
than
Barcelona
,
or
the
Frontiers
of
Portugal
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
Barcelona
be
one
of
the
large
and
most
populous
city
in
all
Spain
,
<EOS>
fortify'd
with
bastion
;
one
side
thereof
be
secur'd
by
the
Sea
;
and
the
other
by
a
strong
Fortification
call'd
Monjouick
.
<EOS>
the
Place
be
of
so
large
a
Circumference
,
that
thirty
thousand
Men
would
scarce
suffice
to
form
the
line
of
Circumvallation
.
<EOS>
It
once
resist
for
many
month
an
Army
of
that
force
;
and
be
almost
at
the
great
Distance
from
England
of
any
Place
belong
to
that
Monarchy
.
  
<EOS>
this
short
description
of
these
two
Places
will
appear
highly
necessary
,
if
it
be
consider'd
,
that
no
person
without
it
would
be
able
to
judge
of
the
Design
which
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
intend
to
pursue
,
when
he
first
take
the
Arch
-
Duke
aboard
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
the
Earl
now
find
himself
under
a
necessity
of
quit
that
noble
Design
,
upon
his
Receipt
of
Orders
from
England
,
while
he
lie
in
the
Bay
of
Altea
,
to
proceed
directly
to
Catalonia
;
to
which
the
Arch
-
Duke
,
as
well
as
many
Sea
and
Land
Officers
,
be
most
inclin'd
;
and
the
Prince
of
Hesse
more
than
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
on
receive
those
Orders
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
seem'd
to
be
of
opinion
,
that
from
an
Attempt
,
which
he
think
under
a
Probability
of
Success
,
he
be
condemn'd
to
undertake
what
be
next
to
an
impossibility
of
effect
;
since
nothing
appear'd
<EOS>
to
him
so
injudicious
as
an
Attempt
upon
Barcelona
.
<EOS>
a
place
at
such
a
Distance
from
receive
any
Reinforcement
or
Relief
;
the
only
Place
in
which
the
Spaniards
have
a
Garrison
of
regular
force
;
and
those
in
Number
rather
exceed
the
Army
he
be
to
undertake
the
Siege
with
,
be
enough
to
cool
the
Ardour
of
a
person
of
less
Penetration
and
Zeal
than
what
the
Earl
have
on
all
occasion
demonstrate
.
<EOS>
whereas
if
the
General
,
as
he
intend
,
have
make
an
immediate
March
to
Madrid
,
after
he
have
secur'd
<EOS>
Valencia
,
and
the
town
adjacent
,
which
be
all
ready
to
submit
and
declare
for
King
Charles
;
or
if
otherwise
inclin'd
,
have
it
not
in
their
power
to
make
any
considerable
resistance
;
to
which
,
if
it
be
add
,
that
he
could
have
have
Mules
and
horse
immediately
provide
for
him
,
in
what
Number
he
pleas'd
,
together
with
Carriages
necessary
for
Artillery
,
Baggage
,
and
ammunition
;
in
few
day
he
could
have
forc'd
King
Philip
out
of
Madrid
,
where
he
have
so
little
Force
to
oppose
him
.
<EOS>
and
as
there
be
nothing
in
his
way
to
prevent
or
obstruct
his
marching
thither
,
it
be
hard
to
conceive
any
other
Part
King
Philip
could
have
act
in
such
an
extremity
,
than
to
retire
either
towards
Portugal
or
Catalonia
.
<EOS>
in
either
of
which
case
he
must
have
leave
all
the
middle
Part
of
Spain
open
to
the
Pleasure
of
the
Enemy
;
who
in
the
mean
time
would
have
have
it
in
their
power
to
prevent
any
communication
of
those
body
at
such
opposite
Extreams
of
the
Country
,
as
be
the
Frontiers
of
Portugal
and
Barcelona
,
where
only
,
as
I
say
before
,
be
any
regular
troop
.
  
<EOS>
and
on
the
other
side
,
as
the
Forces
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
be
more
than
sufficient
for
an
attempt
where
there
be
so
little
Danger
of
Opposition
;
so
if
their
Army
on
the
Frontiers
of
Portugal
should
have
march'd
<EOS>
back
upon
him
into
the
Country
;
either
the
Portugueze
Army
could
have
enter'd
into
Spain
without
opposition
;
or
,
at
bad
,
suppose
the
General
have
be
forc'd
to
retire
,
his
retreat
would
have
be
easy
and
safe
into
those
Parts
of
Valencia
and
Andahzia
,
which
he
previously
have
secur'd
.
<EOS>
besides
,
Gibraltar
,
the
strong
place
in
Spain
,
if
not
in
the
whole
World
,
be
already
in
our
Possession
,
and
a
great
fleet
at
Hand
ready
to
give
assistance
in
all
Places
near
the
Sea
.
<EOS>
from
all
which
it
be
pretty
apparent
,
that
in
a
little
time
the
war
on
our
side
may
have
be
support
without
enter
the
Mediterranean
;
by
which
mean
all
reinforcement
would
have
be
much
near
at
Hand
,
and
the
expence
of
transport
troop
and
Ammunition
very
considerably
diminish'd
.
  
<EOS>
but
none
of
these
argument
,
though
every
one
of
them
be
found
on
solid
Reason
,
be
of
Force
enough
against
the
prevail
Opinion
for
an
Attempt
upon
Catalonia
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crow
,
Agent
for
the
Queen
in
those
Parts
,
have
send
into
England
most
positive
assurance
,
that
nothing
would
be
want
,
<EOS>
if
once
our
Fleet
make
an
invasion
amongst
the
Catalans
:
the
Prince
of
Hesse
likewise
abound
in
mighty
Offers
and
prodigious
assurance
;
all
which
enforc'd
our
Army
to
that
Part
of
Spain
,
and
that
gallant
Prince
to
those
attempt
in
which
he
lose
his
life
.
<EOS>
very
much
against
the
Inclination
of
our
General
,
who
foresaw
all
those
difficulty
,
which
be
no
less
evident
afterwards
to
every
one
;
and
the
Sense
of
which
occasion'd
<EOS>
those
Delays
,
and
that
opposition
to
any
Effort
upon
Barcelona
,
which
run
thro
'
so
many
successive
council
of
War
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
pursuant
to
his
Instructions
from
England
,
the
repeat
desire
of
the
Arch
-
Duke
,
and
the
importunity
of
the
Prince
of
Hesse
,
our
General
give
order
to
sail
from
Altea
towards
the
Bay
of
Barcelona
,
the
chief
City
of
Catalonia
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
when
we
arriv'd
there
,
he
be
very
unwilling
to
land
any
of
the
Forces
,
till
he
see
some
probability
of
that
assistance
and
Succour
so
must
boasted
of
,
and
so
often
promis'd
.
<EOS>
but
as
nothing
appear'd
<EOS>
but
some
small
number
of
Men
,
very
indifferently
arm'd
,
and
without
either
Gentlemen
or
Officers
at
the
Head
of
them
;
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
be
of
opinion
,
this
could
not
be
deem'd
sufficient
Encouragement
for
him
to
engage
in
an
Enterprize
,
which
carry'd
so
poor
a
face
of
probability
of
Success
along
with
it
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
it
be
urg'd
,
that
till
a
Descent
be
make
,
and
the
Affairs
thoroughly
engag'd
<EOS>
in
,
it
be
not
to
be
expect
that
any
great
number
would
appear
,
or
that
Persons
of
Condition
would
discover
themselves
.
<EOS>
upon
all
which
it
be
resolv'd
<EOS>
the
troop
should
be
land
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
our
force
be
disembark'd
,
and
immediately
encamp'd
;
notwithstanding
which
the
Number
of
Succours
increas'd
very
slowly
,
and
that
after
the
first
straggle
manner
.
<EOS>
nor
be
those
that
do
appear
any
way
to
be
depend
on
;
come
when
they
think
fit
,
and
go
away
when
they
pleas'd
,
and
not
to
be
bring
under
any
regular
Discipline
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
pretend
,
that
until
they
see
the
Artillery
land
as
well
as
force
,
they
would
not
believe
any
Siege
actually
intend
.
<EOS>
this
bring
the
General
under
a
sort
of
necessity
of
comply
in
that
also
.
<EOS>
though
certainly
so
to
do
must
be
allow'd
<EOS>
a
little
unreasonable
,
while
the
Majority
in
all
council
of
War
declar'd
<EOS>
the
design
to
be
impracticable
;
and
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
have
positive
order
to
proceed
accord
to
such
majority
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
Prince
of
Hesse
be
pleas'd
to
demand
pay
for
those
Stragglers
,
as
officer
and
Soldiers
,
endeavour
to
maintain
,
that
it
could
not
be
expect
that
man
should
venture
their
life
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
thus
we
come
to
Catalonia
upon
assurance
of
universal
assistance
;
but
find
,
when
we
come
there
,
that
we
be
to
have
none
unless
we
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
and
as
we
be
send
thither
without
money
to
pay
for
any
thing
,
it
have
certainly
be
for
us
more
tolerable
to
have
be
in
a
Country
where
we
may
have
take
by
Force
what
we
could
not
obtain
any
other
way
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
to
do
the
Miquelets
all
possible
Justice
,
I
must
say
,
that
notwithstanding
the
Number
of
'em
,
which
hover'd
about
the
place
,
never
much
exceed
fifteen
hundred
Men
;
if
sometimes
more
,
oftner
less
;
and
though
they
never
come
under
any
Command
,
but
plant
themselves
where
and
as
they
pleas'd
;
yet
do
they
considerable
service
in
take
Possession
of
all
the
Country
Houses
and
Convents
,
that
lie
between
the
Hills
and
the
Plain
of
Barcelona
;
by
mean
whereof
they
render'd
it
impossible
for
the
Enemy
to
make
any
Sorties
or
sally
at
any
Distance
from
the
Town
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
begin
all
those
difficulty
to
bear
,
which
long
before
by
the
General
have
be
apprehend
.
<EOS>
the
troop
have
continu'd
under
a
State
of
Inactivity
for
the
Space
of
three
week
,
all
which
be
spend
in
perpetual
Contrivances
and
Disputes
amongst
our
self
,
not
with
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
in
six
several
council
of
War
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
,
under
the
circumstance
we
then
lie
,
be
reject
as
a
Madness
and
Impossibility
.
<EOS>
and
though
the
General
and
Brigadier
Stanhope
(
afterward
Earl
Stanhope
)
consent
to
some
Effort
should
be
make
to
satisfy
the
Expectation
of
the
World
,
than
with
any
hope
of
Success
.
<EOS>
however
,
no
consent
at
all
could
be
obtain'd
from
any
Council
of
War
;
and
the
Dutch
General
in
particular
declar'd
,
that
he
would
not
obey
even
the
command
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
if
he
should
order
the
Sacrifice
of
the
troop
under
him
in
so
unjustifiable
a
Manner
,
without
the
Consent
of
a
Council
of
War
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
all
those
officer
,
who
refus'd
their
consent
to
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
,
offer'd
to
march
into
the
Country
,
and
attempt
any
other
Place
,
that
be
not
provide
with
so
strong
and
numerous
a
Garrison
;
take
it
for
grant
,
that
no
Town
in
Catalonia
,
Barcelona
except
,
could
make
long
resistance
;
and
in
case
the
troop
in
that
Garrison
should
pursue
them
,
they
then
may
have
an
opportunity
of
fight
them
at
less
Disadvantage
in
the
open
field
,
than
behind
the
wall
of
a
place
of
such
Strength
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
should
they
have
issu'd
out
on
any
such
design
,
<EOS>
a
defeat
of
those
troop
would
have
put
the
Province
of
Catalonia
,
together
with
the
Kingdoms
of
Aragon
and
Valencia
,
into
the
Hands
of
King
Charles
more
effectually
than
the
taking
of
Barcelona
it
self
.
  
<EOS>
let
it
be
observ'd
,
en
passant
,
that
by
those
offer
of
the
Land
Officers
in
a
Council
of
War
,
it
be
easy
to
imagine
what
would
have
be
the
Success
of
our
troop
,
have
they
march'd
directly
from
Valencia
to
Madrid
.
<EOS>
for
if
after
two
month
Alarm
,
it
be
think
reasonable
,
as
well
as
practicable
,
to
march
into
the
open
Country
rather
than
attempt
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
,
where
force
equal
,
if
not
superior
in
Number
,
be
ready
to
follow
us
at
the
Heels
;
what
may
not
have
be
expect
from
an
invasion
by
our
troop
when
and
where
they
could
meet
with
little
opposition
?
<EOS>
but
leave
the
consideration
of
what
may
have
be
,
I
shall
now
endeavour
at
least
with
great
Exactness
to
set
down
some
of
the
most
remarkable
event
from
our
taking
to
the
Relief
of
Barcelona
.
  
<EOS>
the
repeat
Refusals
of
the
council
of
War
for
undertake
the
Siege
of
so
strong
a
place
,
with
a
Garrison
so
numerous
,
and
those
refusal
ground
upon
such
solid
reason
,
against
a
design
so
rash
,
reduc'd
<EOS>
the
General
to
the
utmost
perplexity
.
<EOS>
the
Court
of
King
Charles
be
immerg'd
<EOS>
in
complaint
;
all
belong
to
him
lament
the
hard
Fate
of
that
Prince
,
to
be
bring
into
Catalonia
only
to
return
again
,
without
the
Offer
of
any
one
Effort
in
his
Favour
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
Hand
,
our
own
officer
and
soldier
be
highly
dissatisfy'd
,
that
they
be
reproach'd
,
because
not
dispos'd
to
enter
upon
and
engage
themselves
in
Impossibilities
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
in
the
manner
that
the
Siege
be
propos'd
and
insist
upon
by
the
Prince
of
Hesse
,
in
every
of
the
several
council
of
War
,
after
the
loss
of
many
Men
,
throw
away
to
no
other
purpose
,
but
to
avoid
the
Shame
(
as
the
expression
run
)
of
come
like
Fools
and
go
away
like
Cowards
,
it
could
have
end
in
nothing
but
a
retreat
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
It
afforded
but
small
Comfort
to
the
Earl
to
have
foresee
all
these
difficulty
,
and
to
have
it
in
his
power
to
say
,
that
he
would
never
have
take
the
Arch
-
Duke
on
Board
,
nor
have
propos'd
to
him
the
Hopes
of
a
Recovery
of
the
Spanish
Monarchy
from
King
Philip
,
if
he
could
have
imagin'd
<EOS>
it
probable
,
that
he
should
not
have
be
at
liberty
to
pursue
his
own
design
,
accord
to
his
own
judgment
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
allow'd
very
hard
for
him
,
who
have
undertake
so
great
a
work
,
and
that
without
any
order
from
the
government
;
and
by
so
do
could
have
have
no
justification
but
by
Success
;
I
say
,
it
must
be
allow'd
to
be
very
hard
(
after
the
Undertaking
have
be
approv'd
in
England
)
that
he
should
find
himself
to
be
direct
in
this
manner
by
those
at
a
Distance
,
upon
ill
ground
and
confident
report
from
Mr.
Crow
;
and
compell'd
,
as
it
be
,
though
General
,
to
follow
the
sentiment
of
stranger
,
who
either
have
private
view
of
Ambition
,
or
have
no
immediate
care
or
concern
for
the
troop
employ'd
<EOS>
in
this
Expedition
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
present
unhappy
circumstanche
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
in
the
Camp
before
Barcelona
:
Impossibilities
propos'd
;
no
expedient
to
be
accept
;
a
Court
reproaching
;
Councils
of
War
reject
;
and
the
Dutch
General
refuse
the
assistance
of
the
troop
under
his
command
;
and
what
surmount
all
,
a
despair
of
bring
such
animosity
and
differ
opinion
to
any
tolerable
Agreement
.
<EOS>
yet
all
these
difficulty
,
instead
of
discourage
the
Earl
,
set
every
Faculty
of
his
more
afloat
;
and
,
at
last
,
produc'd
a
lucky
Thought
,
which
be
happily
attend
with
event
extraordinary
,
and
Scenes
of
Success
much
beyond
his
expectation
;
<EOS>
such
,
as
the
General
himself
be
hear
to
confess
,
it
have
be
next
to
Folly
to
have
look'd
<EOS>
for
;
as
certainly
,
in
prima
facie
,
it
would
hardly
have
bear
propose
,
to
take
by
Surprize
a
Place
much
strong
than
Barcelona
it
self
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
that
his
only
Hope
of
succeed
consist
in
this
:
that
no
person
could
suppose
such
an
Enterprize
could
enter
into
the
imagination
of
Man
;
and
without
doubt
the
General
's
chief
Dependence
lie
upon
what
he
find
true
in
the
Sequel
;
that
the
Governor
and
Garrison
of
Monjouick
,
by
reason
of
their
own
Security
,
would
be
very
negligent
,
and
very
little
upon
their
Guard
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
to
make
the
Experiment
,
he
take
an
opportunity
,
unknown
to
any
person
but
an
aid
de
Camp
that
attend
him
,
and
go
out
to
view
the
Fortifications
:
<EOS>
and
there
be
no
Horse
in
that
strong
Fortress
;
and
the
miquelet
be
possess'd
of
all
the
Houses
and
Gardens
in
the
Plain
,
it
be
not
difficult
to
give
himself
that
Satisfaction
,
take
his
way
by
the
Foot
of
the
Hill
.
<EOS>
the
Observation
he
make
of
the
Place
it
self
,
the
Negligence
and
Supineness
of
the
Garrison
,
together
with
his
own
uneasy
circumstance
,
soon
bring
the
Earl
to
a
resolution
of
put
his
first
Conceptions
in
Execution
,
satisfy'd
<EOS>
as
he
be
,
from
the
situation
of
the
ground
between
Monjouick
and
the
Town
,
that
if
the
first
be
in
our
Possession
,
the
Siege
of
the
latter
may
be
undertake
with
some
Prospect
of
Success
.
  
<EOS>
from
what
have
be
say
,
some
may
be
apt
to
conclude
that
the
Siege
afterward
succeed
,
when
the
attack
be
make
from
the
side
of
Monjouick
,
it
have
not
be
impossible
to
have
prevail'd
,
if
the
Effort
have
be
make
on
the
East
Side
of
the
Town
,
where
our
force
be
at
first
encamp'd
,
and
where
only
we
could
have
make
our
approach
,
if
Monjouick
have
not
be
in
our
Power
.
<EOS>
but
a
few
word
will
convince
any
of
common
experience
of
the
utter
impossibility
of
Success
upon
the
East
Part
of
the
Town
,
although
many
almost
miraculous
accident
make
us
succeed
when
we
bring
our
battery
to
bear
upon
that
Part
of
Barcelona
towards
the
West
.
<EOS>
the
ground
to
the
East
be
a
perfect
level
for
many
mile
,
which
would
have
necessitate
our
make
our
approach
in
a
regular
way
;
and
consequently
our
man
must
have
be
expos'd
to
the
full
Fire
of
their
whole
Artillery
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
Town
be
on
that
side
much
strong
than
any
other
;
there
be
an
out
-
work
just
under
the
Walls
of
the
Town
,
flank'd
by
the
Courtin
and
the
face
of
two
bastion
,
which
may
have
cost
us
half
our
troop
to
possess
,
before
we
could
have
rais'd
a
Battery
against
the
Walls
.
<EOS>
or
supposing
,
after
all
,
a
competent
Breach
have
be
make
,
what
a
wise
piece
of
Work
must
it
have
be
to
have
attempt
a
storm
against
double
the
Number
of
regular
troop
within
?
  
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
we
be
so
favour
by
the
situation
,
when
we
make
the
attack
from
the
side
of
Monjouick
,
that
the
Breach
be
make
and
the
Town
take
without
opening
of
trench
,
or
without
our
being
at
all
incommode
by
any
sally
of
the
Enemy
;
as
in
truth
they
make
not
one
during
the
whole
Siege
.
<EOS>
Our
great
Battery
,
which
consist
of
upward
of
fifty
heavy
Cannon
,
supply'd
from
the
Ships
,
and
manag'd
by
the
Seamen
,
be
plac'd
upon
a
Spot
of
rise
Ground
,
just
large
enough
to
contain
our
Guns
,
with
two
deep
hollow
way
on
each
side
the
field
,
at
each
end
whereof
we
have
rais'd
a
little
Redoubt
,
which
serv'd
to
preserve
our
man
from
the
Shot
of
the
Town
.
<EOS>
those
little
Redoubts
,
in
which
we
have
some
field
Pieces
,
flank'd
<EOS>
the
Battery
,
and
render'd
it
intirely
secure
from
any
Surprize
of
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
there
be
several
other
small
battery
rais'd
upon
the
Hills
adjacent
,
in
place
not
to
be
approach'd
,
which
,
in
a
manner
,
render'd
all
the
Artillery
of
the
Enemy
useless
,
by
reason
their
Men
could
not
play
'em
,
but
with
the
utmost
Danger
;
whereas
our
be
secure
,
very
few
be
kill'd
,
and
those
mostly
by
random
Shot
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
General
;
forc'd
,
as
he
be
,
to
take
this
extraordinary
Resolution
,
he
conclude
,
the
readiest
way
to
surprize
his
enemy
be
to
elude
his
Friends
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
call'd
a
Council
of
War
a
-
shore
,
of
the
Land
Officers
;
and
aboard
,
of
the
Admirals
and
Sea
Officers
:
in
both
which
it
be
resolv'd
,
that
in
case
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
be
judg'd
impracticable
,
and
that
the
troop
should
be
re
-
imbark'd
by
a
day
appoint
,
an
Effort
should
be
make
upon
the
Kingdom
of
Naples
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
day
affix'd
be
come
,
the
heavy
Artillery
land
for
the
Siege
be
return'd
aboard
the
Ships
,
and
every
thing
in
appearance
prepar'd
for
a
re
-
imbarkment
.
<EOS>
during
which
,
the
General
be
oblig'd
to
undergo
all
the
Reproaches
of
a
dissatisfy'd
Court
;
and
what
be
more
uneasy
to
him
,
the
murmuring
of
the
Sea
Officers
,
who
,
not
so
competent
judge
in
what
relate
to
siege
,
be
one
and
all
inclin'd
<EOS>
to
a
design
upon
Barcelona
;
and
the
rather
,
because
as
the
Season
be
so
far
spend
,
it
be
think
altogether
improper
to
engage
the
Fleet
in
any
new
Undertaking
.
<EOS>
however
,
all
thing
be
so
well
disguis'd
by
our
seeming
preparation
for
a
retreat
,
that
the
very
Night
our
troop
be
in
March
towards
the
Attack
of
Monjouick
,
there
be
publick
Entertainments
and
Rejoicings
in
the
Town
for
the
raising
of
the
Siege
.
  
<EOS>
the
Prince
of
Hesse
have
take
large
Liberties
in
complain
against
all
the
Proceedings
in
the
Camp
before
Barcelona
;
even
to
insinuation
,
that
though
the
Earl
give
his
opinion
for
some
Effort
in
public
,
yet
us'd
he
not
sufficient
Authority
over
the
other
General
Officers
to
incline
them
to
comply
;
throw
out
withal
some
Hints
,
that
the
General
from
the
beginning
have
declar'd
<EOS>
himself
in
favour
of
other
Operations
,
and
against
come
to
Catalonia
<EOS>
;
the
latter
part
whereof
be
nothing
but
fact
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
complain'd
,
that
the
boasted
Assistance
be
no
way
make
good
;
and
that
in
failure
thereof
,
his
troop
be
to
be
sacrifice
to
the
Humours
of
a
Stranger
;
one
who
have
no
command
;
and
whose
conduct
may
bear
a
question
whether
equal
to
his
courage
.
<EOS>
these
reproach
of
one
another
have
breed
so
much
ill
blood
between
those
two
great
Men
,
that
for
above
a
Fortnight
they
have
no
Correspondence
,
nor
ever
exchang'd
<EOS>
one
Word
.
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
,
however
,
have
make
his
proper
disposition
,
and
deliver'd
out
his
Orders
,
begin
his
March
in
the
evening
with
twelve
Hundred
Foot
and
two
hundred
Horse
,
which
of
necessity
be
to
pass
by
the
Quarters
of
the
Prince
of
Hesse
.
<EOS>
that
Prince
,
on
their
appearance
,
be
tell
that
the
General
be
come
to
speak
with
him
;
and
be
bring
into
his
Apartment
,
the
Earl
acquaint
him
,
that
he
have
at
last
resolv'd
upon
an
attempt
against
the
enemy
;
add
,
that
now
,
if
he
pleas'd
,
he
may
be
a
Judge
of
their
Behaviour
,
and
see
whether
his
officer
and
Soldiers
have
deserv'd
<EOS>
that
character
which
he
have
so
liberally
give
'em
.
<EOS>
the
Prince
make
answer
,
that
he
have
always
be
ready
to
take
his
share
;
but
could
hardly
believe
,
that
troop
march
that
way
could
make
any
attempt
against
the
Enemy
to
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
however
,
without
further
discourse
he
call'd
for
his
Horse
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
we
may
see
what
Share
Fortune
have
in
the
great
event
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
have
never
engag'd
<EOS>
in
such
a
dangerous
Affair
in
cold
blood
and
unprovok'd
<EOS>
;
and
if
such
an
Enterprize
have
be
resolv'd
on
in
a
regular
way
,
it
be
very
likely
he
may
have
give
the
Command
to
some
of
the
General
Officers
;
since
it
be
not
usual
,
nor
hardly
allowable
,
for
one
,
that
command
in
chief
,
to
go
in
person
on
such
kind
of
service
.
<EOS>
but
here
we
see
the
General
and
Prince
,
notwithstanding
their
late
indifferent
Harmony
,
engag'd
<EOS>
together
in
this
most
desperate
undertaking
.
  
<EOS>
Brigadier
Stanhope
and
Mr.
Methuen
(
now
Sir
Paul
)
be
the
General
's
particular
Friends
,
and
those
he
most
consult
,
and
most
confide
in
;
yet
he
never
impart
this
Resolution
of
his
to
either
of
them
;
for
he
be
not
willing
to
engage
them
in
a
design
so
dangerous
,
and
where
there
be
so
little
Hope
of
Success
;
rather
choose
to
reserve
them
as
person
most
capable
of
give
advice
and
assistance
in
the
Confusion
,
great
enough
already
,
which
yet
must
have
be
great
,
if
any
Accident
have
happen'd
to
himself
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
very
good
reason
to
believe
,
that
the
Motive
,
which
mainly
engag'd
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
in
this
Enterprize
,
be
to
satisfy
the
Prince
of
Hesse
and
the
World
,
that
his
Diffidence
proceed
from
his
concern
for
the
troop
commit
to
his
charge
,
and
not
for
his
own
person
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
Hand
,
the
great
character
of
the
two
Gentlemen
just
mention'd
be
so
well
known
,
that
it
will
easily
gain
Credit
,
that
the
only
way
the
General
could
take
to
prevent
their
being
of
the
Party
,
be
to
conceal
it
from
them
,
as
he
do
from
all
mankind
,
even
from
the
Archduke
himself
.
<EOS>
and
certainly
there
never
be
a
more
universal
Surprize
than
when
the
firing
be
hear
next
Morning
from
Monjouick
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
now
proceed
to
give
an
exact
account
of
this
great
action
;
of
which
no
Person
,
that
I
have
hear
of
,
ever
yet
take
upon
him
to
deliver
to
posterity
the
glorious
Particulars
;
and
yet
the
Consequences
and
event
,
by
what
follow
,
will
appear
so
great
,
and
so
very
extraordinary
,
<EOS>
that
few
,
if
any
,
have
they
have
it
in
their
Power
,
would
have
deny'd
<EOS>
themselves
the
Pleasure
or
the
World
<EOS>
the
Satisfaction
of
know
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
troop
,
which
march'd
all
night
along
the
Foot
of
the
Mountains
,
arriv'd
two
hour
before
day
under
the
Hill
of
Monjouick
,
not
a
quarter
of
a
Mile
from
the
outward
work
:
for
this
reason
it
be
take
for
grant
,
whatever
the
design
be
which
the
General
have
propos'd
to
himself
,
that
it
would
be
put
in
execution
before
day
-
light
;
but
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
be
now
pleas'd
to
inform
the
officer
of
the
Reasons
why
he
choose
to
stay
till
the
light
appear'd
.
<EOS>
He
be
of
opinion
that
any
Success
would
be
impossible
,
unless
the
Enemy
come
into
the
outward
Ditch
under
the
Bastions
of
the
second
enclosure
;
but
that
if
they
have
time
allow'd
<EOS>
them
to
come
thither
,
there
be
no
Palisadoes
,
our
man
,
by
leap
in
upon
them
,
after
receipt
of
their
first
Fire
,
may
drive
'em
into
the
upper
Works
;
and
follow
them
close
,
with
some
probability
,
may
force
them
,
under
that
Confusion
,
into
the
inward
fortification
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
General
's
Reasons
then
and
there
give
;
after
which
,
have
promis'd
ample
reward
to
such
as
<EOS>
discharg'd
<EOS>
their
Duty
<EOS>
well
,
a
Lieutenant
,
with
thirty
Men
,
be
order'd
to
advance
towards
the
bastion
nearest
the
Town
;
and
a
Captain
,
with
fifty
man
,
to
support
him
.
<EOS>
after
the
Enemy
's
Fire
they
be
to
leap
into
the
Ditch
,
and
their
order
be
to
follow
'em
close
,
if
they
retir'd
into
the
upper
work
:
nevertheless
,
not
to
pursue
'em
farther
,
if
they
make
into
the
inner
Fort
;
but
to
endeavour
to
cover
themselves
within
the
Gorge
of
the
Bastion
.
  
<EOS>
a
Lieutenant
and
a
Captain
,
with
the
like
number
of
Men
and
the
same
Orders
,
be
command
to
a
Demi
-
Bastion
at
the
extremity
of
the
Fort
towards
the
West
,
which
be
above
Musket
-
shoot
from
the
inward
fortification
.
<EOS>
towards
this
place
the
Wall
,
which
be
cut
into
the
Rock
,
be
not
fac'd
for
about
twenty
yard
;
and
here
our
own
Men
get
up
;
<EOS>
where
they
find
three
piece
of
Cannon
upon
a
Platform
,
without
many
man
to
defend
them
.
  
<EOS>
those
appoint
to
the
bastion
towards
the
Town
be
sustain'd
by
two
hundred
Men
;
with
which
the
General
and
Prince
go
in
Person
.
<EOS>
the
like
Number
,
under
the
Directions
of
Colonel
Southwell
,
be
to
sustain
the
attack
towards
the
West
;
and
about
five
hundred
Men
be
leave
under
the
Command
of
a
Dutch
Colonel
,
whose
order
be
to
assist
,
<EOS>
where
,
in
his
own
Judgment
,
he
should
think
most
proper
;
and
these
be
draw
up
between
the
two
party
appoint
to
begin
the
Assault
.
<EOS>
My
Lot
be
on
the
side
where
the
Prince
and
Earl
be
in
person
;
and
where
we
sustain'd
the
only
loss
from
the
first
Fire
of
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
,
though
quite
expos'd
,
and
though
the
Glacis
be
all
escarp'd
upon
the
live
Rock
,
go
on
with
an
undaunted
courage
;
and
immediately
after
the
first
Fire
of
the
Enemy
,
all
,
that
be
not
<EOS>
kill'd
or
wound
,
leap'd
in
,
pel
-
mel
,
amongst
the
Enemy
;
who
,
be
thus
boldly
attack'd
,
and
see
other
pour
in
upon
'em
,
retir'd
in
great
Confusion
;
and
some
one
way
,
some
another
,
run
into
the
inward
work
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
large
port
in
the
Flank
of
the
principal
Bastion
,
towards
the
North
-
East
,
and
a
cover'd
way
,
through
which
the
General
and
the
Prince
of
Hesse
<EOS>
follow'd
<EOS>
the
flying
force
;
and
by
that
Means
become
possess'd
of
it
.
<EOS>
luckily
enough
here
lie
a
number
of
great
stone
in
the
Gorge
of
the
Bastion
,
for
the
Use
of
the
Fortification
;
with
which
we
make
a
sort
of
Breast
-
Work
,
before
the
Enemy
recover'd
of
their
Amaze
,
or
make
any
considerable
fire
upon
us
from
their
inward
Fort
,
which
command
the
upper
part
of
that
Bastion
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
afterwards
inform'd
,
that
the
Commander
of
the
Citadel
,
expect
but
one
Attack
,
have
call'd
off
the
Men
from
the
most
distant
and
western
part
of
the
Fort
,
to
that
side
which
be
next
the
Town
;
upon
which
our
man
get
into
a
Demi
-
Bastion
in
the
most
extream
part
of
the
Fortification
.
<EOS>
here
they
get
possession
of
three
piece
of
Cannon
,
with
hardly
any
opposition
;
and
have
leisure
to
cast
up
a
little
Retrenchment
,
and
to
make
use
of
the
Guns
they
have
take
to
defend
it
.
<EOS>
under
this
situation
,
the
Enemy
,
when
drive
into
the
inward
Fort
,
be
expos'd
to
our
fire
from
those
place
we
be
possess'd
of
,
in
case
they
offer'd
to
make
any
Sally
,
or
other
Attempt
against
us
.
<EOS>
thus
we
every
Moment
become
well
and
well
prepar'd
against
any
Effort
of
the
Garrison
.
<EOS>
and
as
they
could
not
pretend
to
assail
us
without
evident
Hazard
;
so
nothing
remain'd
for
us
to
do
,
till
we
could
bring
up
our
Artillery
and
Mortars
.
<EOS>
now
it
be
that
the
General
send
for
the
thousand
Men
under
Brigadier
Stanhope
's
Command
,
which
he
have
post
at
a
Convent
,
halfway
between
the
Town
and
Monjouick
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
almost
a
total
cessation
of
Fire
,
the
Men
on
both
side
be
under
Cover
.
<EOS>
the
General
be
in
the
upper
Part
of
the
Bastion
;
the
Prince
of
Hesse
below
,
behind
a
little
work
at
the
Point
of
the
Bastion
,
whence
<EOS>
he
could
only
see
the
head
of
the
Enemy
over
the
Parapet
of
the
inward
Fort
.
<EOS>
soon
after
an
Accident
happen'd
which
cost
that
gallant
Prince
his
Life
.
  
<EOS>
the
Enemy
have
line
of
communication
between
Barcelona
and
Monjouick
.
<EOS>
the
Governor
of
the
former
,
upon
hear
the
firing
from
the
latter
,
immediately
send
four
hundred
dragoon
on
Horseback
,
under
Orders
,
that
two
hundred
dismount
should
reinforce
the
Garrison
,
and
the
other
two
hundred
should
return
with
their
horse
back
to
the
Town
.
  
<EOS>
when
those
two
Hundred
Dragoons
be
accordingly
get
into
the
inward
Fort
,
unseen
by
any
of
our
man
,
the
Spaniards
,
wave
their
hat
over
their
head
,
repeat
over
and
over
,
viva
el
Rey
,
Viva
.
<EOS>
this
the
Prince
of
Hesse
unfortunately
take
for
a
Signal
of
their
desire
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
with
too
much
Warmth
and
Precipitancy
,
call
to
the
soldier
follow
,
They
surrender
,
they
surrender
,
he
advanc'd
with
near
three
hundred
Men
(
who
<EOS>
follow'd
him
without
any
Orders
from
their
General
)
along
the
Curtain
which
lead
to
the
Ditch
of
the
inward
Fort
.
<EOS>
the
Enemy
suffer
them
to
come
into
the
Ditch
,
and
there
surround
'em
,
take
two
hundred
of
them
Prisoners
,
at
the
same
time
make
a
discharge
upon
the
rest
,
who
be
run
back
the
way
they
come
.
<EOS>
this
firing
bring
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
down
from
the
upper
Part
of
the
Bastion
,
to
see
what
be
do
below
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
just
turn'd
<EOS>
the
Point
of
the
bastion
,
he
see
the
Prince
of
Hesse
retire
,
with
the
Men
that
have
so
rashly
<EOS>
advanc'd
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
have
exchang'd
<EOS>
a
very
few
word
with
him
,
when
,
from
a
second
fire
,
that
Prince
receiv'd
a
Shot
in
the
great
artery
of
the
Thigh
,
of
which
he
die
immediately
,
fall
down
at
the
General
's
Feet
,
who
instantly
give
order
to
carry
off
the
body
to
the
next
Convent
.
  
<EOS>
almost
the
same
moment
an
Officer
come
to
acquaint
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
that
a
great
body
of
Horse
and
Foot
,
at
least
three
thousand
,
be
on
their
March
from
Barcelona
towards
the
Fort
.
<EOS>
the
Distance
be
near
a
Mile
,
all
uneven
Ground
;
so
that
the
Enemy
be
either
discoverable
,
or
not
to
be
see
,
just
as
they
be
march
on
the
Hills
or
in
the
Vallies
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
General
directly
get
on
Horseback
,
to
take
a
view
of
those
force
from
the
rise
ground
without
the
Fort
,
have
leave
all
the
Posts
,
which
be
already
take
,
well
secur'd
with
the
allot
Numbers
of
Officers
and
soldier
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
event
will
demonstrate
of
what
Consequence
the
Absence
or
Presence
of
one
Man
may
prove
on
great
occasion
;
no
sooner
be
the
Earl
out
of
the
Fort
,
the
care
of
which
he
have
leave
under
the
Command
of
the
Lord
Charlemont
(
a
person
of
know
merit
and
undoubted
Courage
,
but
somewhat
too
flexible
in
his
Temper
)
<EOS>
when
a
panick
Fear
(
tho
'
the
Earl
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
only
go
to
take
a
view
of
the
Enemy
)
<EOS>
seiz'd
upon
the
Soldiery
,
which
be
a
little
too
easily
comply'd
with
by
the
Lord
Charlemont
,
then
command
Officer
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
;
for
I
hear
an
Officer
,
ready
enough
to
take
such
Advantages
,
urge
to
him
,
that
none
of
all
those
post
we
be
become
master
of
,
be
tenable
;
that
to
offer
at
it
would
be
no
well
than
wilfully
sacrifice
human
life
to
Caprice
and
Humour
;
and
just
like
a
man
's
knock
his
Head
against
Stone
Walls
,
to
try
which
be
hard
.
<EOS>
have
over
-
hear
this
Piece
of
Lip
-
Oratory
,
and
finding
by
the
Answer
that
it
be
too
likely
to
prevail
,
and
that
all
I
be
like
to
say
would
avail
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
slipt
away
as
fast
as
I
could
,
to
acquaint
the
General
with
the
Danger
impend
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
pass'd
along
,
I
take
notice
that
the
Panick
be
upon
the
Increase
,
the
general
Rumor
affirming
,
that
we
should
be
all
cut
off
by
the
troop
that
be
come
out
of
Barcelona
,
if
we
do
not
immediately
gain
the
Hills
,
or
the
Houses
possess'd
by
the
Miquelets
.
<EOS>
officer
and
Soldiers
,
under
this
prevail
Terror
,
quit
their
post
;
and
in
one
united
Body
(
the
Lord
Charlemont
at
the
Head
of
them
)
march'd
,
or
rather
hurry'd
out
of
the
Fort
;
and
be
come
halfway
down
the
Hill
before
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
come
up
to
them
.
<EOS>
though
on
my
acquaint
him
with
the
shameful
and
surprize
Accident
he
make
no
stay
,
but
answer
,
with
a
good
deal
of
Vehemence
,
Good
God
,
be
it
possible
?
<EOS>
hasten
back
as
fast
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
think
my
self
happier
than
in
this
Piece
of
Service
to
my
country
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
could
not
but
value
it
,
as
have
be
therein
more
than
a
little
instrumental
in
the
glorious
Successes
which
succeed
;
since
immediately
upon
this
Notice
from
me
,
the
Earl
gallop'd
up
the
Hill
,
and
light
when
he
come
to
Lord
Charlemont
,
he
take
his
half
-
pike
out
of
his
hand
;
and
turn
to
the
Officers
and
Soldiers
,
tell
them
,
if
they
would
not
face
about
and
follow
him
,
they
should
have
the
scandal
and
eternal
Infamy
upon
them
of
have
desert
their
post
,
and
abandon'd
their
General
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
surprize
to
see
with
what
Alacrity
and
new
courage
they
fac'd
about
and
follow'd
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
.
<EOS>
in
a
Moment
they
have
forget
their
apprehension
;
and
,
without
doubt
,
have
they
meet
with
any
Opposition
,
they
would
have
behav'd
themselves
with
the
great
bravery
.
<EOS>
but
as
these
motion
be
unperceiv'd
by
the
Enemy
,
all
the
post
be
regain'd
,
and
anew
possess'd
in
less
than
half
an
Hour
,
without
any
loss
:
Though
,
have
our
force
march'd
half
musket
-
shoot
farther
,
their
retreat
would
have
be
perceiv'd
,
and
<EOS>
all
the
Success
attendant
on
this
glorious
Attempt
must
have
be
intirely
blast
.
  
<EOS>
another
Incident
which
attend
this
happy
Enterprize
be
this
:
the
two
hundred
man
which
fall
into
the
Hands
of
the
Enemy
,
by
the
unhappy
Mistake
of
the
Prince
of
Hesse
,
be
carry'd
directly
into
the
Town
.
<EOS>
the
Marquis
of
Risburg
,
a
Lieutenant
-
General
,
who
command
the
three
thousand
man
which
be
march
from
the
Town
to
the
Relief
of
the
Fort
,
examin'd
<EOS>
the
Prisoners
,
as
they
pass'd
by
;
and
they
all
agree
that
the
General
and
the
Prince
of
Hesse
be
in
person
with
the
troop
that
make
the
attack
on
Monjouick
,
the
Marquis
give
immediate
order
to
retire
to
the
Town
;
take
it
for
grant
,
that
the
main
body
of
the
troop
attend
the
Prince
and
General
;
and
that
some
Design
therefore
be
on
foot
to
intercept
his
return
,
in
case
he
should
venture
too
far
.
<EOS>
thus
the
unfortunate
loss
of
our
two
hundred
Men
turn'd
to
our
advantage
,
in
prevent
the
Advance
of
the
Enemy
,
which
must
have
put
the
Earl
of
peterborow
to
inconceivable
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
the
Body
of
one
thousand
,
under
Brigadier
Stanhope
,
be
come
up
to
Monjouick
,
and
no
interruption
give
us
by
the
Enemy
,
our
affair
be
put
into
very
good
order
on
this
side
;
while
the
Camp
on
the
other
side
be
so
fortify'd
,
that
the
Enemy
,
during
the
Siege
,
never
make
one
Effort
against
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
the
communication
between
the
two
camp
be
secure
enough
;
although
our
troop
be
oblige
to
a
tedious
March
along
the
Foot
of
the
Hills
,
whenever
the
General
think
fit
to
relieve
those
on
Duty
on
the
side
of
the
attack
,
from
those
Regiments
encamp'd
on
the
West
Side
of
Barcelona
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
after
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
have
take
Care
to
secure
the
first
Camp
to
the
Eastward
of
the
Town
,
he
give
order
to
the
officer
of
the
Fleet
to
land
the
Artillery
and
Ammunition
behind
the
Fortress
to
the
Westward
.
<EOS>
immediately
upon
the
Landing
whereof
,
two
mortar
be
fix'd
;
from
both
which
we
ply'd
the
Fort
of
Monjouick
furiously
with
our
bomb
.
<EOS>
but
the
third
or
fourth
Day
,
one
of
our
Shells
fortunately
light
on
their
Magazine
of
Powder
,
blow
it
up
;
and
with
it
the
Governor
,
and
many
principal
officer
who
be
at
dinner
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
Blast
,
at
the
same
instant
,
throw
down
a
face
of
one
of
the
small
Bastions
;
which
the
vigilant
miquelet
,
ready
enough
to
take
all
Advantages
,
no
sooner
see
(
for
they
be
under
the
Hill
,
very
near
the
place
)
but
they
readily
enter'd
,
while
the
Enemy
be
under
the
utmost
Confusion
.
<EOS>
if
the
Earl
,
no
less
watchful
than
they
,
have
not
at
the
same
Moment
throw
himself
in
with
some
regular
troop
,
and
appeas'd
the
general
Disorder
,
in
all
probability
the
Garrison
have
be
put
to
the
Sword
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
General
's
Presence
not
only
allay'd
<EOS>
the
Fury
of
the
miquelet
;
but
keep
his
own
troop
under
strictest
discipline
:
<EOS>
so
that
in
a
happy
Hour
for
the
fright
Garrison
,
the
General
give
Officers
and
Soldiers
Quarters
,
make
them
Prisoners
of
War
.
  
<EOS>
how
critical
be
that
Minute
wherein
the
General
meet
his
retreat
Commander
?
<EOS>
a
very
few
step
farther
have
exclude
us
our
own
conquest
,
to
the
utter
loss
of
all
those
great
glory
which
ensu'd
.
<EOS>
nor
would
that
have
be
the
bad
;
for
besides
the
Shame
attend
such
an
ill
concerted
retreat
from
our
Acquests
on
Monjouick
,
we
must
have
feel
the
accumulative
Disgrace
of
infamously
retire
aboard
the
Ships
that
bring
us
;
but
Heaven
reserv'd
for
our
general
amazing
Scenes
both
of
Glory
and
Mortification
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
here
omit
one
Singularity
of
Life
,
which
will
demonstrate
Men
's
different
way
of
Thinking
,
if
not
somewhat
bad
;
when
many
year
after
,
to
one
in
Office
,
who
seem'd
a
little
too
dead
to
my
complaint
,
and
by
that
mean
irritate
my
human
passion
,
injustice
to
my
self
,
as
well
as
Cause
<EOS>
,
I
urge
this
Piece
of
Service
,
by
which
I
not
only
preserv'd
the
Place
,
but
the
Honour
of
my
Country
,
that
Minister
petite
,
to
mortify
my
expectation
and
baffle
my
Plea
,
with
a
grimace
as
odd
as
his
Logick
,
return'd
,
that
,
in
his
opinion
,
the
Service
pretend
be
a
Disservice
to
the
nation
;
since
Perseverance
have
cost
the
Government
more
money
than
all
our
conquest
be
worth
,
could
we
have
keep
'em
.
<EOS>
so
irregular
be
the
Conceptions
of
Man
,
when
even
great
action
thwart
the
bent
of
an
interested
Will
!
  
<EOS>
the
Fort
of
Monjouick
be
thus
surprizingly
reduc'd
,
furnish'd
a
strange
vivacity
to
Mens
Expectations
,
and
as
extravagantly
flatter'd
<EOS>
their
hope
;
for
as
Success
never
fail
to
excite
weak
mind
to
pursue
their
good
Fortune
,
though
many
time
to
their
own
loss
;
so
be
it
often
too
apt
to
push
on
more
elevated
spirit
to
renew
the
Encounter
for
atchieve
new
Conquests
,
by
hazard
too
rashly
all
their
former
Glory
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
every
Body
now
begin
to
make
his
utmost
effort
;
and
look'd
upon
himself
as
a
Drone
,
if
he
be
not
employ'd
in
do
something
or
other
towards
push
forward
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
it
self
,
and
raise
proper
battery
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
but
,
after
all
,
it
must
in
Justice
be
acknowledg'd
,
that
notwithstanding
this
prodigious
Success
that
attend
this
bold
Enterprize
,
the
Land
Forces
of
themselves
,
without
the
assistance
of
the
sailor
,
could
never
have
reduc'd
the
Town
.
<EOS>
the
Commanders
and
Officers
of
the
Fleet
have
always
evinc'd
<EOS>
themselves
Favourers
of
this
Project
upon
Barcelona
.
<EOS>
a
new
undertaking
so
late
in
the
Year
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
be
their
utter
aversion
,
and
what
they
hate
to
hear
of
.
<EOS>
elate
therefore
with
a
beginning
so
auspicious
,
they
give
a
more
willing
assistance
than
could
have
be
ask'd
,
or
judiciously
expect
.
<EOS>
the
Admirals
forget
their
element
,
and
act
as
General
Officers
at
land
:
They
come
every
day
from
their
ship
,
with
a
body
of
man
form'd
into
company
,
and
regularly
marshall'd
and
command
by
Captains
and
Lieutenants
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
Captain
Littleton
in
particular
,
one
of
the
most
advanced
Captains
in
the
whole
Fleet
,
offer'd
of
himself
to
take
care
of
the
Landing
and
Conveyance
of
the
Artillery
to
the
Camp
.
<EOS>
and
answerable
to
that
his
first
Zeal
be
his
vigour
all
along
,
for
find
it
next
to
an
impossibility
to
draw
the
Cannon
and
Mortars
up
such
vast
Precipices
by
horse
,
if
the
Country
have
afford
them
,
he
caus'd
harness
to
be
make
for
two
hundred
Men
;
and
by
that
Means
,
after
a
prodigious
Fatigue
and
Labour
,
bring
the
Cannon
and
Mortars
necessary
for
the
Siege
up
to
the
very
battery
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
be
the
Siege
begin
;
nor
be
it
carry'd
<EOS>
on
with
any
less
application
;
the
approach
be
make
by
an
Army
of
Besiegers
,
that
very
little
,
if
at
all
,
exceed
the
Number
of
the
Besieg'd
;
not
altogether
in
a
regular
Manner
,
our
few
Forces
would
not
admit
it
;
but
yet
with
regularity
enough
to
secure
our
two
little
camp
,
and
preserve
a
communication
between
both
,
not
to
be
interrupt
or
incommode
by
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
We
have
soon
erect
three
several
battery
against
the
Place
,
all
on
the
West
Side
of
the
Town
,
viz
.
<EOS>
one
of
nine
Guns
,
another
of
twelve
,
and
the
last
of
upward
of
Thirty
.
<EOS>
from
all
which
we
ply'd
the
Town
incessantly
,
and
with
all
imaginable
fury
;
and
very
often
in
whole
vollie
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
it
be
think
not
only
adviseable
,
but
necessary
,
to
erect
another
Battery
,
upon
a
low
piece
of
Ground
under
a
small
Hill
;
which
lie
more
within
Reach
,
and
opposite
to
those
place
where
the
wall
be
imagin'd
weak
,
would
annoy
the
Town
the
more
;
and
be
design'd
for
six
Guns
only
,
may
soon
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
a
French
Engeneer
have
the
direction
;
and
indeed
very
quickly
perfect
it
.
<EOS>
but
when
it
come
to
be
consider'd
which
way
to
get
the
Cannon
to
it
,
most
be
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
absolutely
impracticable
,
by
reason
of
the
vast
Descent
;
tho
'
<EOS>
I
believe
they
may
have
add
a
strong
reason
,
and
perhaps
more
intrinsick
,
that
it
be
extremely
expos'd
to
the
Fire
of
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
have
gain'd
<EOS>
some
little
reputation
in
the
Attack
of
Monjouick
,
this
difficulty
be
at
last
to
be
put
upon
me
;
and
<EOS>
as
some
,
not
my
enemy
,
suppos'd
,
more
out
of
Envy
than
good
Will
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
I
come
to
the
place
,
and
have
carefully
take
a
view
of
it
,
though
I
be
sensible
enough
of
the
Difficulty
,
I
make
my
main
objection
as
to
the
Time
for
accomplish
it
;
for
it
be
then
between
Nine
and
Ten
,
and
the
Guns
be
to
be
mount
by
day
-
light
.
<EOS>
neither
could
I
at
present
see
any
other
way
to
answer
their
expectation
,
than
by
cast
the
Cannon
down
the
Precipice
,
at
all
hazard
,
to
the
place
below
,
where
that
fourth
Battery
be
erect
.
  
<EOS>
this
want
not
objection
to
;
and
therefore
to
answer
my
purpose
,
as
to
point
of
Time
,
sixty
Men
more
be
order'd
<EOS>
me
,
as
much
as
possible
to
facilitate
the
work
by
number
;
and
accordingly
I
set
about
it
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
be
set
all
Hands
to
work
,
and
have
give
order
to
my
men
to
begin
some
pace
back
,
to
make
the
descent
more
gradual
,
and
thereby
render
the
Task
a
little
more
feasible
,
Major
Collier
,
who
command
the
Train
,
come
to
me
;
and
perceive
the
difficulty
of
the
Undertaking
,
in
a
Fret
<EOS>
tell
me
,
I
be
impos'd
upon
;
and
vow'd
he
would
go
and
find
out
Brigadier
Petit
,
and
let
him
know
the
impossibility
,
as
well
as
the
Unreasonableness
of
the
Task
I
be
put
upon
.
<EOS>
He
have
scarce
utter'd
those
word
,
and
turn'd
<EOS>
himself
round
to
perform
his
Promise
,
when
an
unlucky
shot
with
a
Musket
-
Ball
wound
him
through
the
Shoulder
;
upon
which
he
be
carry'd
off
,
and
I
see
him
not
till
some
considerable
time
after
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
painful
Diligence
,
and
the
additional
Compliment
of
Men
,
however
,
I
so
well
succeed
(
such
be
my
great
good
Fortune
)
that
the
way
be
make
,
and
the
Guns
,
by
the
Help
of
Fascines
,
and
other
less
preparation
below
,
safely
let
down
and
mount
;
so
that
that
fourth
Battery
begin
to
play
upon
the
Town
before
Break
of
Day
;
and
with
all
the
Success
that
be
propos'd
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
Breach
in
a
very
few
day
after
be
find
wholly
practicable
;
and
all
thing
be
get
ready
for
a
general
storm
.
<EOS>
which
Don
Valasco
the
Governor
be
sensible
of
,
immediately
beat
a
Parley
;
upon
which
it
be
,
among
other
Articles
,
conclude
,
that
the
Town
should
be
surrender'd
in
three
day
;
and
the
well
to
ensure
it
,
the
Bastion
,
which
command
the
Port
St.
Angelo
,
be
directly
put
into
our
possession
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
the
Expiration
of
the
limited
three
Days
,
a
very
unexpected
Accident
fall
out
,
which
hasten'd
the
surrender
.
<EOS>
Don
Valasco
,
during
his
Government
,
have
behav'd
himself
very
arbitrarily
,
and
thereby
procur'd
,
as
the
Consequence
of
it
,
a
large
proportion
of
ill
will
,
not
only
among
the
Townsmen
,
but
among
the
Miquelets
,
who
have
,
in
their
zeal
to
King
Charles
,
flock'd
from
all
Parts
of
Catalonia
to
the
Siege
of
their
capital
;
and
who
,
on
the
Signing
of
the
Articles
of
Surrender
,
have
find
various
Ways
,
be
well
acquaint
with
the
most
private
Avenues
,
to
get
by
Night
into
the
Town
:
so
that
early
in
the
morning
they
begin
to
plunder
all
that
they
know
enemy
to
King
Charles
,
or
think
friend
to
the
Prince
his
Competitor
.
  
<EOS>
Their
main
design
be
upon
Valasco
the
Governor
,
whom
,
if
they
could
have
get
into
their
Hands
,
it
be
not
to
be
question'd
,
but
as
far
as
his
Life
and
Limbs
would
have
serv'd
,
they
would
have
sufficiently
satiate
their
vengeance
upon
.
<EOS>
He
expect
no
less
;
and
therefore
conceal
himself
,
till
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
could
give
Orders
for
his
more
safe
and
private
conveyance
by
Sea
to
Alicant
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
in
the
Town
all
be
in
the
utmost
Confusion
;
which
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
at
the
very
first
hearing
,
hasten
to
appease
;
with
his
usual
Alacrity
he
rid
all
alone
to
Port
St.
Angelo
,
where
at
that
time
my
self
happen'd
to
be
;
and
demand
to
be
admit
,
the
Officer
of
the
Guard
,
under
Fear
and
Surprise
,
open'd
<EOS>
the
Wicket
,
through
which
the
Earl
enter'd
,
and
I
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
Scarce
have
we
go
a
hundred
Paces
,
when
we
see
a
Lady
of
apparent
quality
,
and
indisputable
Beauty
,
in
a
strange
,
but
most
affect
Agony
,
fly
from
the
apprehend
Fury
of
the
Miquelets
;
her
lovely
hair
be
all
flow
about
her
Shoulders
,
which
,
and
the
consternation
she
be
in
,
rather
add
to
,
than
any
thing
diminish'd
<EOS>
from
the
Charms
of
an
Excess
of
Beauty
.
<EOS>
She
,
as
be
very
natural
to
People
in
Distress
,
make
up
directly
to
the
Earl
,
her
eye
satisfy
her
he
be
a
person
likely
to
give
her
all
the
Protection
she
want
.
<EOS>
and
as
soon
as
ever
she
come
near
enough
,
in
a
manner
that
declar'd
<EOS>
her
quality
before
she
speak
<EOS>
,
she
crav'd
<EOS>
that
Protection
,
tell
him
,
the
well
to
secure
it
,
who
it
be
that
ask'd
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
generous
Earl
presently
convinc'd
her
,
he
want
no
Intreaties
,
have
,
before
he
know
her
to
be
the
Dutchess
of
Popoli
,
take
her
by
the
Hand
,
in
order
to
convey
her
through
the
wicket
<EOS>
which
he
enter'd
<EOS>
at
,
to
a
Place
of
Safety
without
the
Town
.
  
<EOS>
I
stay'd
behind
,
while
the
Earl
convey'd
the
distress'd
dutchess
to
her
request
Asylum
;
and
I
believe
it
be
much
the
long
part
of
an
Hour
before
he
return'd
.
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
ever
he
come
back
,
he
,
and
my
self
,
at
his
Command
,
repair'd
to
the
place
of
most
Confusion
,
which
the
extraordinary
noise
full
readily
direct
us
to
;
and
which
happen
to
be
on
the
Parade
before
the
Palace
.
<EOS>
there
it
be
that
the
Miquelets
be
make
their
utmost
effort
to
get
into
their
hand
the
almost
sole
Occasion
of
the
Tumult
,
and
the
object
of
their
rage
fury
,
the
person
of
Don
Valasco
,
the
late
Governor
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
here
that
the
Earl
preserv'd
<EOS>
that
Governor
from
the
violent
,
but
perhaps
too
just
resentment
of
the
Miquelets
;
and
,
as
I
say
before
,
convey'd
him
by
Sea
to
Alicant
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
I
could
little
doubt
the
effect
,
or
be
any
thing
surpriz'd
<EOS>
at
the
Easiness
of
the
Task
,
when
I
see
,
that
wherever
he
appear'd
<EOS>
the
popular
Fury
be
in
a
Moment
allay'd
,
and
that
every
Dictate
of
that
General
be
assent
to
with
the
utmost
Chearfulness
and
Deference
.
<EOS>
Valasco
,
before
his
Embarkment
,
have
give
order
,
in
Gratitude
to
his
preserver
,
for
all
the
Gates
to
be
deliver'd
up
,
tho
'
short
of
the
stipulate
Term
;
and
they
be
accordingly
so
deliver
,
and
our
troop
take
possession
so
soon
as
ever
that
Governor
be
aboard
the
Ship
that
be
to
convey
him
to
Alicant
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
,
Brigadier
Stanhope
order'd
a
tent
to
be
pitch'd
<EOS>
as
near
the
Trenches
as
possibly
could
be
with
Safety
;
where
he
not
only
entertain'd
the
chief
officer
who
be
upon
Duty
,
but
likewise
the
Catalonian
Gentlemen
who
bring
miquelet
to
our
assistance
.
<EOS>
I
remember
I
see
an
old
Cavalier
,
have
his
only
Son
with
him
,
who
appear'd
a
fine
young
Gentleman
,
about
twenty
year
of
Age
,
go
into
the
Tent
,
in
order
to
dine
with
the
Brigadier
.
<EOS>
but
whilst
they
be
at
Dinner
,
an
unfortunate
Shot
come
from
the
Bastion
of
St.
Antonio
,
and
intirely
strike
off
the
Head
of
the
Son
.
<EOS>
the
father
immediately
rise
up
,
first
look
down
upon
his
headless
Child
,
and
then
lift
up
his
eye
to
Heaven
,
whilst
the
Tears
run
down
his
Cheeks
,
he
cross'd
himself
,
and
only
say
,
Fiat
volunta
tua
,
and
bear
it
with
a
wonderful
Patience
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
a
sad
Spectacle
,
and
truly
it
affect
me
now
whilst
I
be
write
.
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
tho
'
<EOS>
for
some
time
after
the
Revolution
he
have
be
employ'd
in
civil
Affairs
,
return'd
to
the
military
Life
with
great
satisfaction
,
which
be
ever
his
inclination
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Stanhope
,
who
be
justly
afterwards
create
an
Earl
,
do
well
deserve
this
Motto
,
Tam
Marte
quam
Mercurio
;
for
truly
he
behav'd
,
all
the
time
he
continu'd
in
Spain
,
as
if
he
have
be
inspir'd
with
Conduct
;
for
the
victory
at
Almanar
be
intirely
owing
to
him
;
and
likewise
at
the
Battle
of
Saragosa
he
distinguish'd
himself
with
great
Bravery
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
not
Success
at
Bruhega
be
not
his
fault
;
for
no
man
can
resist
Fate
;
for
'
twas
decreed
by
Heaven
that
Philip
should
remain
King
of
Spain
,
and
Charles
to
be
Emperor
of
Germany
.
<EOS>
yet
each
of
these
Monarchs
have
be
ungrateful
to
the
Instruments
which
the
Almighty
make
use
of
to
preserve
them
upon
their
Thrones
;
for
one
have
not
be
King
of
Spain
but
for
France
;
and
the
other
have
not
be
Emperor
but
for
England
.
  
<EOS>
Barcelona
,
the
chief
Place
in
Catalonia
,
be
thus
in
our
Hands
,
as
soon
as
the
Garrison
,
little
inferior
to
our
Army
,
have
march'd
out
with
Drums
beat
,
colour
flying
,
&
c.
<EOS>
accord
to
the
Articles
,
Charles
the
Third
make
his
publick
entry
,
and
be
proclaim'd
<EOS>
King
,
and
receiv'd
with
the
general
Acclamations
,
and
all
other
demonstration
of
Joy
suitable
to
that
great
Occasion
.
  
<EOS>
some
day
after
which
,
the
Citizens
,
far
from
be
satiate
with
their
former
demonstration
of
their
Duty
,
send
a
petition
to
the
king
,
by
proper
deputy
for
that
purpose
appoint
,
desire
Leave
to
give
more
ample
instance
of
their
affection
in
a
public
Cavalcade
.
<EOS>
the
King
grant
their
request
,
and
the
Citizens
,
pursuant
thereto
,
make
their
preparation
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
day
appoint
,
the
King
,
plac'd
in
a
Balcony
belong
to
the
House
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
appear'd
ready
to
honour
the
Show
.
<EOS>
the
Ceremonial
,
to
speak
nothing
figuratively
,
be
very
fine
and
grand
:
those
of
the
first
Rank
make
their
appearance
in
decent
order
,
and
upon
fine
horse
;
and
other
under
arm
,
and
in
company
,
march'd
with
native
Gravity
and
Grandeur
,
all
salute
his
Majesty
as
they
pass'd
by
,
after
the
Spanish
Manner
,
which
that
Prince
return'd
with
the
Movement
of
his
Hand
to
his
Mouth
;
for
the
king
of
Spain
be
not
allow'd
to
salute
,
or
return
a
Salute
,
by
any
Motion
to
,
or
of
,
the
Hat
.
  
<EOS>
after
these
follow'd
several
Pageants
;
the
first
of
which
be
draw
by
Mules
,
set
off
to
the
Height
with
stately
Feathers
,
and
adorn'd
with
little
bell
.
<EOS>
upon
the
top
of
this
pageant
appear'd
a
man
dress'd
all
in
Green
;
but
in
the
Likeness
of
a
Dragon
.
<EOS>
the
Pageant
make
a
Stop
just
over
-
against
the
Balcony
where
the
King
sate
,
the
Dragonical
Representative
divert
him
with
great
variety
of
Dancings
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
all
the
time
throw
out
dollar
by
Handfuls
among
the
Populace
,
which
they
as
constantly
receiv'd
with
the
loud
Acclamation
and
repeat
Cries
of
Viva
,
viva
,
Carlos
Terceros
,
viva
la
Casa
d'Austria
.
  
<EOS>
when
that
have
play'd
<EOS>
its
part
,
another
Pageant
,
draw
as
before
,
make
a
like
full
stop
before
the
same
Balcony
.
<EOS>
on
this
be
plac'd
<EOS>
a
very
large
cage
,
or
Aviary
,
the
cover
of
which
,
by
Springs
contriv'd
<EOS>
for
that
purpose
,
immediately
fly
open
,
and
out
of
it
a
surprize
flight
of
Birds
of
various
colour
.
<EOS>
these
,
all
amaz'd
at
their
sudden
Liberty
,
which
I
take
to
be
the
Emblem
intend
,
hover'd
a
considerable
space
of
time
over
and
about
their
Place
of
Freedom
,
chirp
,
singing
,
and
otherwise
testify
their
mighty
joy
for
their
so
unexpected
enlargement
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
other
pageant
;
but
have
little
in
them
very
remarkable
,
I
have
forget
the
Particulars
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
every
one
of
them
be
dismiss'd
with
the
like
acclamation
of
Viva
,
viva
;
the
Whole
conclude
with
Bonfires
and
Illuminations
common
on
all
such
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
here
omit
one
very
remarkable
instance
of
the
Catholick
Zeal
of
that
Prince
,
which
I
be
soon
after
an
Eye
-
witness
of
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
that
time
in
the
Fruit
-
Market
,
when
the
King
pass
by
in
his
Coach
,
the
host
(
whether
by
Accident
or
Contrivance
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
)
be
bring
,
at
that
very
Juncture
,
out
of
the
great
Church
,
in
order
,
as
I
after
understand
,
to
a
poor
sick
woman
's
receive
the
sacrament
.
<EOS>
on
Sight
of
the
Host
the
King
come
out
of
his
Coach
,
kneel'd
down
in
the
Street
,
which
at
that
time
prov'd
to
be
very
dirty
,
till
the
host
pass'd
by
;
then
rise
up
,
and
take
the
light
Flambeau
from
him
who
bear
it
,
he
<EOS>
follow'd
the
priest
up
a
streight
nasty
Alley
,
and
there
up
a
dark
ordinary
Pair
of
Stairs
,
where
the
poor
sick
woman
lie
.
<EOS>
there
he
stay'd
<EOS>
till
the
whole
Ceremony
be
over
,
when
,
return
to
the
Door
of
the
Church
,
he
very
faithfully
restor'd
the
light
Flambeau
to
the
Fellow
he
have
take
it
from
,
the
People
all
the
while
cry
out
Viva
,
viva
;
an
Acclamation
,
we
may
imagine
,
intend
to
his
Zeal
,
as
well
as
his
person
.
  
<EOS>
another
remarkable
Accident
,
of
a
much
more
moral
Nature
,
I
must
,
injustice
to
the
Temperance
of
that
,
in
this
truly
inimitable
People
,
recite
.
<EOS>
I
be
one
Day
walk
in
one
of
the
most
populous
street
of
that
City
,
where
I
find
an
uncommon
concourse
of
People
,
of
all
Sorts
,
get
together
;
and
imagine
so
great
<EOS>
a
Croud
could
not
be
assemble
on
a
small
Occasion
,
I
prest
in
among
the
rest
;
and
after
a
good
deal
of
Struggling
and
Difficulty
,
reach'd
into
the
Ring
and
Centre
of
that
mix'd
Multitude
.
<EOS>
but
how
do
I
blush
?
<EOS>
with
what
Confusion
do
I
appear
?
<EOS>
when
I
find
one
of
my
own
Countrymen
,
a
drunken
Granadier
,
the
attractive
Loadstone
of
all
that
high
and
low
mob
,
and
the
Butt
of
all
their
Merriment
?
<EOS>
It
will
be
easily
imagin'd
to
be
a
thing
not
a
little
surprizing
to
one
of
our
Country
,
to
find
that
a
drunken
man
should
be
such
a
wonderful
sight
;
however
,
the
witty
Sarcasms
that
be
then
by
high
and
low
throw
upon
that
senseless
Creature
,
<EOS>
and
as
I
interpret
matter
,
me
in
him
,
be
so
pungent
,
that
if
I
do
not
curse
my
curiosity
,
I
think
it
best
to
withdraw
my
self
as
fast
as
Legs

,
over
which
there
be
a
fair
and
famous
Bridge
of
Boats
.
<EOS>
the
Waters
of
this
River
be
always
of
a
dirty
red
Colour
,
somewhat
fouler
than
our
Moorish
Waters
;
yet
be
it
the
only
water
the
inhabitant
drink
,
or
covet
to
drink
;
and
every
House
provide
for
its
own
Convenience
Cisterns
to
preserve
it
in
,
by
a
few
hour
stand
it
become
as
clear
as
the
clear
Rock
-
water
,
but
as
soft
as
milk
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
for
Softness
,
Brightness
,
and
Pleasantness
of
Taste
,
the
Natives
prefer
it
to
all
the
Waters
in
the
World
.
<EOS>
and
I
must
declare
in
favour
of
their
Opinion
,
that
none
ever
<EOS>
pleas'd
me
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
Town
be
of
the
great
moment
to
our
Army
,
as
open
a
passage
into
the
Kingdom
of
Valencia
on
one
side
,
and
the
Kingdom
of
Arragon
on
the
other
:
<EOS>
and
be
of
it
self
tolerably
defensible
<EOS>
,
in
human
Appearance
may
probably
repay
a
little
care
and
charge
in
its
Repair
and
Improvement
.
<EOS>
upon
this
employ
be
I
appoint
,
and
thus
be
I
busy'd
,
till
the
arrival
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
with
his
little
Army
,
in
order
to
march
to
Valencia
,
the
capital
of
that
Province
.
<EOS>
here
he
leave
in
Garrison
Colonel
Hans
Hamilton
's
Regiment
;
the
place
,
nevertheless
,
be
under
the
Command
of
a
Spanish
Governor
,
appoint
by
King
Charles
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
Earl
stay'd
a
few
day
at
this
place
,
under
expectation
of
the
promis'd
Succours
from
Barcelona
,
he
receiv'd
a
Proprio
(
or
Express
)
from
the
King
of
Spain
,
full
of
excuse
,
instead
of
Forces
.
<EOS>
and
yet
the
very
same
letter
,
in
a
paradoxical
Manner
,
command
him
,
at
all
event
,
to
attempt
the
Relief
of
Santo
Mattheo
,
where
Colonel
Jones
command
,
and
which
be
then
under
Siege
by
the
Conde
de
los
Torres
(
as
be
the
Report
)
with
upward
of
three
thousand
Men
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
could
not
muster
above
one
thousand
Foot
,
and
about
two
hundred
Horse
;
a
small
Force
to
make
an
attempt
of
that
nature
upon
such
a
superior
power
:
yet
the
Earl
's
vivacity
(
as
will
be
occasionally
further
observ'd
in
the
course
of
these
Memoirs
)
never
much
regard
Numbers
,
so
there
be
but
room
,
by
any
Stratagem
,
to
hope
for
Success
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
for
his
great
Encouragement
and
Consolation
,
the
same
Letter
intimate
,
that
a
great
concourse
of
the
Country
People
be
up
in
Arms
,
to
the
Number
of
many
thousand
,
in
Favour
of
King
Charles
,
and
want
only
officer
,
the
Enterprize
would
be
easy
and
unattende
with
much
Danger
.
<EOS>
but
upon
mature
Enquiry
,
the
Earl
find
that
great
body
of
Men
all
in
nubibus
;
and
that
the
Conde
,
in
the
plain
truth
of
the
Matter
,
be
much
strong
than
the
letter
at
first
represent
.
  
<EOS>
Santo
Mattheo
be
a
place
of
know
importance
;
and
that
from
its
situation
,
which
cut
off
all
communication
between
Catalonia
and
Valencia
;
and
,
consequently
,
should
it
fall
into
the
Hands
of
the
Enemy
,
the
Earl
's
Design
upon
the
latter
must
inevitably
have
be
postpon'd
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
grant
,
the
command
for
attempt
the
Relief
of
it
be
press
and
peremptory
;
nevertheless
,
the
Earl
be
very
conscious
to
himself
,
that
as
the
promis'd
Reinforcements
be
suspend
,
his
officer
would
not
approve
of
the
Attempt
upon
the
Foot
of
such
vast
Inequalities
;
and
their
own
declar'd
<EOS>
sentiment
soon
confirm'd
<EOS>
the
Dictates
of
the
Earl
's
Reason
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
address
himself
to
those
officer
in
a
different
manner
:
He
tell
'em
he
only
<EOS>
desir'd
they
would
be
passive
,
and
leave
it
to
him
to
work
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
Earl
find
out
and
hire
two
spanish
spy
,
for
whose
Fidelity
(
as
his
great
Precaution
always
lead
him
to
do
)
<EOS>
he
take
sufficient
security
;
and
dispatch'd
'em
with
a
letter
to
Colonel
Jones
,
Governor
of
the
Place
,
intimate
his
Readiness
,
as
well
as
ability
,
to
relieve
him
;
and
,
above
all
,
exhort
him
to
have
the
Miquelets
in
the
Town
ready
,
on
Sight
of
his
troop
,
to
issue
out
,
pursue
,
and
plunder
;
since
that
would
be
all
they
would
have
to
do
,
and
all
he
would
expect
at
their
hand
.
<EOS>
the
spy
be
dispatch'd
accordingly
;
and
,
pursuant
to
Instructions
,
one
betray'd
and
discover'd
the
other
who
have
the
letter
in
charge
to
deliver
to
Colonel
Jones
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
,
to
carry
on
the
Feint
,
have
in
the
mean
time
,
by
divide
his
troop
,
and
march
secretly
over
the
Mountains
,
draw
his
men
together
,
so
as
to
make
their
appearance
on
the
Height
of
a
neighbour
Mountain
,
little
more
than
Cannot
-
shot
from
the
Enemy
's
Camp
.
<EOS>
the
Tale
of
the
spy
be
fully
confirm'd
,
and
the
Conde
(
though
an
able
General
)
march'd
off
with
some
precipitation
with
his
Army
;
and
by
that
mean
the
Earl
's
small
number
of
twelve
Hundred
have
Liberty
to
march
into
the
Town
without
Interruption
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
let
slip
an
Action
of
Colonel
Jones
's
just
before
the
Earl
's
Delivery
of
them
:
<EOS>
the
Conde
,
for
want
of
Artillery
,
have
set
his
miner
to
work
;
and
the
Colonel
,
find
they
have
make
some
dangerous
advance
,
turn
the
course
of
a
Rivulet
,
that
run
through
the
Middle
of
the
Town
,
in
upon
them
,
and
make
them
quit
a
work
they
think
be
bring
to
Perfection
.
  
<EOS>
SANTO
Mattheo
be
reliev'd
,
as
I
have
say
,
the
Earl
,
though
he
have
so
far
gain'd
<EOS>
his
Ends
,
leave
not
the
fly
enemy
without
a
Feint
of
Pursuit
;
with
such
caution
,
nevertheless
,
that
in
case
they
should
happen
to
be
well
inform'd
of
his
Weakness
,
he
may
have
a
resource
either
back
again
to
Santo
Mattheo
,
or
to
Vinaros
on
the
Sea
-
side
;
or
some
other
Place
,
as
occasion
may
require
.
<EOS>
but
have
just
before
receiv'd
fresh
Advice
,
that
the
Reinforcements
he
expect
be
anew
countermand
;
and
that
the
Duke
of
Anjou
have
increas'd
<EOS>
his
troop
to
twelve
thousand
Men
;
the
officer
,
not
enough
elate
with
the
last
success
to
adventure
upon
new
experiment
,
resolv'd
,
in
a
Council
of
War
,
to
advise
the
Earl
,
who
have
just
before
receiv'd
<EOS>
a
discretionary
Commission
in
lieu
of
troop
,
so
to
post
the
force
under
him
,
as
not
to
be
cut
off
from
be
able
to
assist
the
King
in
Person
;
or
to
march
to
the
Defence
of
Catalonia
,
in
case
of
Necessity
.
  
<EOS>
pursuant
to
this
Resolution
of
the
Council
of
War
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
tho
'
still
intent
upon
his
Expedition
into
Valencia
(
which
have
be
afresh
command
,
even
while
his
supply
be
countermand
)
order
his
Foot
,
in
a
truly
bad
condition
,
by
tedious
Marches
Day
and
Night
over
the
Mountains
,
to
Vinaros
;
and
with
his
two
hundred
Horse
,
set
out
to
prosecute
his
pretended
design
of
pursue
the
fly
enemy
;
resolv'd
,
if
possible
,
notwithstanding
all
seemingly
desperate
circumstance
,
to
perfect
the
Security
of
that
capital
.
  
<EOS>
to
that
purpose
,
the
Earl
,
with
his
small
Body
of
Patrolers
,
go
on
frightne
the
Enemy
,
till
they
come
under
the
Walls
of
Nules
,
<EOS>
a
Town
fortify'd
<EOS>
with
the
good
wall
,
regular
tower
,
and
in
the
good
Repair
of
any
in
that
Kingdom
.
<EOS>
but
even
here
,
upon
the
appearance
of
the
Earl
's
Forlorn
(
if
they
may
not
properly
at
that
time
all
have
pass'd
under
that
Character
)
under
the
same
Panick
they
leave
that
sensible
Town
,
with
only
one
thousand
of
the
Town
's
People
,
well
arm'd
,
for
the
Defence
of
it
.
<EOS>
yet
be
it
scarce
to
be
imagin'd
,
that
the
Earl
,
with
his
small
body
of
two
hundred
Horse
,
should
be
able
to
gain
admission
;
or
,
indeed
,
under
such
circumstance
,
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
but
bold
as
the
Undertaking
be
,
his
good
Genius
go
along
with
him
;
and
so
good
a
Genius
be
it
,
that
it
rarely
leave
him
without
a
good
effect
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
tell
the
day
before
,
that
the
Enemy
,
on
leave
Nules
,
have
get
Possession
of
Villa
Real
,
where
they
put
all
to
the
Sword
.
<EOS>
what
would
have
furnish'd
another
with
Terror
,
inspir'd
<EOS>
his
lordship
with
a
thought
as
fortunate
as
it
be
successful
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
ride
up
to
the
very
Gates
of
the
Town
,
at
the
Head
of
his
Party
,
and
peremptorily
demand
the
chief
Magistrate
,
or
a
priest
,
immediately
to
be
send
out
to
him
;
and
that
under
penalty
of
be
all
put
to
the
Sword
,
and
us'd
as
the
Enemy
have
us'd
those
at
<EOS>
Villa
-
Real
<EOS>
the
day
or
two
before
.
<EOS>
the
troop
,
that
have
so
lately
leave
the
Place
,
have
leave
behind
'em
more
terror
than
Men
;
which
,
together
with
the
peremptory
demand
of
the
Earl
,
soon
produc'd
some
priest
to
wait
upon
the
General
.
<EOS>
by
their
Readiness
to
obey
,
the
Earl
very
justly
imagin'd
<EOS>
fear
to
be
the
motive
;
wherefore
,
to
improve
their
Terror
,
he
only
allow'd
<EOS>
them
six
Minutes
time
to
resolve
upon
a
surrender
,
tell
them
,
that
otherwise
,
so
soon
as
his
Artillery
be
come
up
,
he
would
lay
them
under
the
utmost
extremity
.
<EOS>
the
Priests
return'd
with
this
melancholy
message
into
the
place
;
and
in
a
very
short
time
after
the
Gates
be
throw
open
.
<EOS>
upon
the
Earl
's
Entrance
he
find
two
hundred
Horse
,
which
be
the
Original
of
his
lordship
's
forming
that
Body
of
Horse
,
which
afterwards
prov'd
the
saving
of
Valencia
.
  
<EOS>
the
News
of
the
taking
of
Nules
soon
overtook
the
fly
enemy
;
and
so
increas'd
<EOS>
the
Apprehensions
of
their
Danger
,
that
they
renew'd
<EOS>
their
March
,
the
same
day
;
though
what
they
have
take
before
would
have
satisfy'd
them
much
better
without
it
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
Earl
be
so
well
pleas'd
with
his
Success
,
that
leave
the
Enemy
to
fly
before
their
fear
,
he
make
a
short
turn
towards
Castillon
de
la
Plana
,
a
considerable
,
but
open
Town
,
where
his
lordship
furnish'd
himself
with
four
hundred
horse
more
;
and
all
this
under
the
assurance
that
his
troop
be
drive
the
Enemy
before
them
out
of
the
Kingdom
.
<EOS>
hence
he
send
order
to
Colonel
Pierce
's
Regiment
at
Vinaros
to
meet
him
at
Oropesa
,
a
place
at
no
great
Distance
;
where
,
when
they
come
,
they
be
very
pleasingly
surpriz'd
<EOS>
at
their
be
well
mount
,
and
furnish'd
with
all
accoutrement
necessary
.
<EOS>
after
which
,
leave
'em
canton'd
in
wall'd
Towns
,
where
they
could
not
be
disturb'd
without
Artillery
,
that
indefatigable
General
,
leave
them
full
Orders
,
go
on
his
way
towards
Tortosa
.
  
<EOS>
at
Vinaros
the
Earl
meet
with
Advice
,
that
the
spanish
Militia
of
the
Kingdom
of
Valencia
be
assemble
,
and
have
already
advanc'd
a
day
's
March
at
least
into
that
country
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
collect
,
as
fast
as
he
could
,
the
whole
Corps
together
,
the
Earl
resolv'd
to
penetrate
into
Valencia
directly
;
notwithstanding
this
whole
collect
body
would
amount
to
no
more
than
six
hundred
Horse
and
two
thousand
Foot
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
strong
pass
over
a
River
,
just
under
the
Walls
of
Molviedro
,
which
must
be
first
dispute
and
take
.
<EOS>
this
Brigadier
Mahoni
,
by
the
Orders
of
the
Duke
of
Arcos
,
who
command
the
troop
of
the
Duke
of
Anjou
in
the
Kingdom
of
Valencia
,
have
take
care
to
secure
.
<EOS>
Molviedro
,
though
not
very
strong
,
be
a
wall'd
Town
,
very
populous
of
it
self
;
and
have
in
it
,
besides
a
Garrison
of
eight
hundred
Men
,
most
of
Mahoni
's
dragoon
.
<EOS>
It
lie
at
the
very
Bottom
of
a
high
Hill
;
on
the
upper
Part
whereof
they
shew
the
Ruins
of
the
once
famous
SAGUNTUM
;
famous
sure
to
eternity
,
if
letter
shall
last
so
long
,
for
an
inviolable
Fidelity
to
a
negligent
Confederate
,
against
an
implacable
Enemy
.
<EOS>
here
yet
appear
the
visible
Vestigia
of
awful
Antiquity
,
in
half
stand
arch
,
and
the
yet
unlevell'd
<EOS>
Walls
and
Towers
of
that
once
celebrate
City
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
look
upon
all
these
with
the
eye
of
Despight
,
in
regard
to
their
Enemy
Hannibal
;
with
those
of
Disdain
,
in
respect
to
the
uncommon
and
unaccountable
supineness
of
its
confederate
,
the
Romans
;
but
with
those
of
veneration
,
as
to
the
memory
of
a
glorious
People
,
who
rather
than
stand
reproach'd
with
a
Breach
of
Faith
,
or
the
Brand
of
Cowardice
,
choose
to
sacrifice
themselves
,
their
wife
,
Children
,
and
all
that
be
dear
to
them
,
in
the
flame
of
their
expire
city
.
  
<EOS>
in
Molviedro
,
as
I
say
before
,
Mahoni
command
,
with
eight
hundred
man
,
besides
inhabitant
;
which
,
together
with
our
have
but
little
artillery
,
induc'd
the
officer
under
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
reasonably
enough
to
imagine
and
declare
,
that
there
could
be
no
visible
appearance
of
surmount
such
difficulty
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
,
nevertheless
,
instead
of
indulge
such
Despondencies
,
give
them
Hope
,
<EOS>
that
what
strength
serv'd
not
to
accomplish
,
art
may
possibly
obtain
.
<EOS>
to
that
purpose
he
propose
an
interview
between
himself
and
Mahoni
;
and
accordingly
send
an
Officer
with
a
trumpet
to
intimate
his
Desire
.
<EOS>
the
Motion
be
agree
to
;
and
the
Earl
have
previously
station'd
<EOS>
his
troop
to
advantage
,
and
his
little
artillery
at
a
convenient
Distance
,
with
order
<EOS>
they
should
appear
on
a
slow
March
on
the
side
of
a
rise
Hill
,
during
the
time
of
Conference
,
go
to
the
Place
appoint
;
only
,
as
have
be
stipulate
,
attend
with
a
small
Party
of
Horse
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
meet
,
the
Earl
first
offer'd
<EOS>
all
he
could
to
engage
Mahoni
to
the
Interest
of
King
Charles
;
propose
some
thing
extravagant
enough
(
as
Mahoni
himself
some
time
after
tell
me
)
to
stagger
the
Faith
of
a
Catholick
;
but
all
to
little
purpose
:
<EOS>
Mahoni
be
inflexible
,
which
oblig'd
<EOS>
the
Earl
to
new
measure
.
  
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
Earl
frankly
tell
him
,
that
he
could
not
however
but
esteem
the
confidence
he
have
put
in
him
;
and
therefore
,
to
make
some
retaliation
,
he
be
ready
to
put
it
in
his
Power
to
avoid
the
Barbarities
lately
execute
at
Villa
-
Real
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
relation
to
you
,
"
continue
the
General
,
"
incline
me
to
spare
a
Town
under
your
command
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
near
my
force
be
;
and
can
hardly
doubt
our
soon
be
master
of
the
place
:
what
I
would
therefore
offer
you
,
say
the
Earl
,
be
a
Capitulation
,
that
my
inclination
may
be
hold
in
Countenance
by
my
honour
.
<EOS>
barbarity
,
however
justify
by
Example
,
be
my
utter
aversion
,
and
against
my
nature
;
and
to
testify
so
much
,
together
with
my
good
will
to
your
person
,
be
the
main
intent
of
this
interview
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
frankness
so
far
prevail'd
on
Mahoni
,
that
he
agree
to
return
an
answer
in
half
an
Hour
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
an
answer
be
return
by
a
Spanish
Officer
,
and
a
Capitulation
agree
upon
;
the
Earl
at
the
same
time
endeavour
to
bring
over
that
officer
to
King
Charles
,
on
much
the
same
topick
he
us'd
with
Mahoni
.
<EOS>
but
find
this
equally
fruitless
,
whether
it
be
that
he
tacitly
reproach'd
<EOS>
the
Officer
with
a
Want
of
consideration
in
neglect
to
follow
the
Example
of
his
Commander
,
or
what
else
,
he
create
in
that
Officer
<EOS>
such
a
Jealousy
of
Mahoni
,
that
be
afterward
very
serviceable
to
him
in
his
further
design
.
  
<EOS>
to
forward
which
to
a
good
issue
,
the
Earl
immediately
make
choice
of
two
dragoon
,
who
,
upon
promise
of
Promotion
,
undertake
to
go
as
spy
to
the
Duke
of
Arcos
,
whose
force
lay
not
far
off
,
on
the
other
side
<EOS>
a
large
Plain
,
which
the
Earl
must
unavoidably
pass
,
and
which
would
inevitably
be
attend
with
almost
insuperable
danger
,
if
there
attack'd
<EOS>
by
a
Force
so
much
superior
.
<EOS>
those
spy
,
accord
to
Instructions
,
be
to
discover
to
the
Duke
,
that
they
over
-
hear
the
Conference
between
the
Earl
and
Mahoni
;
and
at
the
same
time
see
a
considerable
number
of
Pistoles
deliver'd
into
Mahoni
's
hand
,
large
promise
pass
at
that
instant
reciprocally
:
but
above
all
,
that
the
Earl
have
recommend
to
him
the
procuring
the
March
of
the
Duke
over
the
Plain
between
them
.
<EOS>
the
spy
go
and
deliver'd
all
accord
to
Concert
;
conclude
,
before
the
Duke
,
that
they
would
ask
no
reward
,
but
undergo
any
Punishment
,
if
Mahoni
do
not
very
soon
send
to
the
Duke
a
request
to
march
over
the
Plain
,
in
order
to
put
the
concerted
Plot
in
execution
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
after
this
pretend
Discovery
before
Mahoni
do
send
indeed
an
Officer
to
the
Duke
,
desire
the
March
of
his
force
over
the
Plain
;
but
,
in
reality
,
to
obstruct
the
Earl
's
Passage
,
which
he
know
very
well
must
be
that
and
no
other
way
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
Duke
be
prepossess'd
by
the
spy
,
and
what
those
spanish
officer
that
at
first
escap'd
have
before
infus'd
,
take
thing
in
their
sense
;
and
as
soon
as
Mahoni
,
who
be
forc'd
to
make
the
good
of
his
way
over
the
Plain
before
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
arriv'd
<EOS>
at
his
Camp
,
he
be
put
under
Arrest
and
send
to
Madrid
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
have
thus
imbib'd
the
Venom
,
and
take
the
Alarm
,
immediately
decamp'd
in
Confusion
,
and
take
a
different
Rout
than
at
first
he
intend
;
leave
that
once
formidable
Plain
open
to
the
Earl
,
without
an
enemy
to
obstruct
him
.
<EOS>
in
some
little
time
after
he
arriv'd
at
Madrid
,
Mahoni
make
his
innocence
appear
,
and
be
create
a
General
;
while
the
Duke
of
Arcos
be
recall'd
from
his
Post
of
Honour
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
after
we
arriv'd
at
Valencia
,
the
Gates
of
which
fine
City
be
set
open
to
us
with
the
high
demonstration
of
Joy
.
<EOS>
I
call'd
it
<EOS>
a
fine
city
;
<EOS>
but
sure
it
richly
deserve
a
bright
epithet
,
since
it
be
a
common
say
among
the
Spaniards
,
that
the
Pleasures
of
Valencia
would
make
a
Jew
forget
Jerusalem
.
<EOS>
It
be
most
sweetly
situate
in
a
very
beautiful
Plain
,
and
within
half
a
League
of
the
Mediterranean
Sea
.
<EOS>
It
never
want
any
of
the
fragrancy
of
Nature
,
and
always
have
something
to
delight
the
most
curious
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
famous
to
a
Proverb
for
fine
woman
;
but
as
infamous
,
and
only
in
that
so
,
for
the
Race
of
Bravoes
,
the
common
companion
of
the
Ladies
of
Pleasure
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
these
wretch
be
so
case
-
harden
,
they
will
commit
a
murder
for
a
Dollar
,
tho
'
they
run
their
country
for
it
when
they
have
do
.
<EOS>
not
that
other
part
of
this
nation
be
uninfested
with
this
sort
of
animal
;
but
here
their
number
be
so
great
,
that
if
a
catalogue
be
to
be
take
of
those
in
other
part
of
that
country
,
perhaps
nine
in
ten
would
be
find
by
Birth
to
be
of
this
Province
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
proceed
,
tho
'
the
Citizens
,
and
all
sort
of
People
,
be
redundant
in
their
various
expression
of
Joy
,
for
an
Entry
so
surprizing
,
and
utterly
lose
to
their
Expedition
,
whatever
it
be
to
their
Wishes
,
the
Earl
have
a
secret
concern
for
the
Publick
,
which
lie
gnaw
at
his
Heart
,
and
which
yet
he
be
force
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
have
not
four
thousand
soldier
in
the
place
,
and
not
Powder
or
Ammunition
for
those
;
nor
any
provision
lay'd
in
for
any
thing
like
a
Siege
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
Hand
,
the
Enemy
without
be
upwards
of
seven
thousand
,
with
a
body
of
four
thousand
more
,
not
fifteen
league
off
,
on
their
March
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
add
to
this
,
the
Marechal
de
Thesse
be
no
farther
off
than
Madrid
,
a
very
few
day
'
March
from
Valencia
;
a
short
way
indeed
for
the
Earl
(
who
,
as
be
say
before
,
be
wholly
unprovided
for
a
Siege
,
which
be
report
to
be
the
sole
end
of
the
Mareschal
's
move
that
way
.
)
<EOS>
but
the
Earl
's
never
-
fail
genius
resolv'd
again
to
attempt
that
by
Art
,
which
the
Strength
of
his
force
utterly
disallow'd
him
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
first
Place
,
his
Intelligence
tell
him
that
sixteen
twenty
-
four
Pounders
,
with
Stores
and
Ammunition
answerable
for
a
Siege
,
be
ship'd
<EOS>
off
for
the
Enemy
's
Service
at
Alicant
,
the
Earl
forthwith
lay
a
design
,
and
with
his
usual
Success
intercept
'em
all
,
supply
that
way
his
own
necessity
at
the
Expence
of
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
the
four
thousand
man
ready
to
reinforce
the
Troops
nearer
Valencia
,
be
the
next
Point
to
be
undertake
;
but
hic
labor
,
hoc
opus
;
since
the
great
body
under
the
Conde
de
las
Torres
(
who
,
with
Mahoni
,
be
now
reinstate
in
his
Post
)
lie
between
the
Earl
and
those
troop
intend
to
be
dispers'd
.
<EOS>
and
what
inhaunc'd
the
Difficulty
,
the
River
Xucar
must
be
pass
in
almost
the
face
of
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
great
disadvantage
as
these
be
,
they
do
not
discourage
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
He
detach'd
<EOS>
by
Night
four
hundred
horse
and
eight
hundred
Foot
,
who
<EOS>
march'd
with
such
hasty
Silence
,
that
they
surpriz'd
<EOS>
that
great
Body
,
route
'em
,
and
bring
into
Valencia
six
hundred
prisoner
very
safely
,
notwithstanding
they
be
oblig'd
,
under
the
same
Night
-
Covert
,
to
pass
very
near
a
Body
of
three
thousand
of
the
Enemy
's
Horse
.
<EOS>
such
a
prodigious
victory
would
hardly
have
gain'd
Credit
in
that
city
,
if
the
Prisoners
bring
in
have
not
be
live
witness
of
the
action
as
well
as
the
Triumph
.
<EOS>
the
Conde
de
las
Torres
,
upon
these
two
military
rebuff
,
draw
off
to
a
more
convenient
distance
,
and
leave
the
Earl
a
little
more
at
ease
in
his
new
Quarters
.
  
<EOS>
here
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
make
his
residence
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
He
be
extreamly
well
belov'd
,
his
affable
Behaviour
exact
as
much
from
all
;
and
he
preserv'd
such
a
good
correspondence
with
the
priest
and
the
Ladies
,
that
he
never
fail'd
of
the
most
early
and
good
intelligence
,
a
thing
by
no
means
to
be
slight
in
the
common
course
of
life
;
but
much
more
commendable
and
necessary
in
a
General
,
with
so
small
an
Army
,
at
open
War
,
and
in
the
Heart
of
his
Enemy
's
Country
.
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
,
by
this
Means
,
some
small
time
after
,
receive
early
intelligence
that
King
Philip
be
actually
on
his
March
to
Barcelona
,
with
an
Army
of
upward
of
twenty
five
thousand
Men
,
under
the
Command
of
a
Mareschal
of
France
,
begin
his
March
towards
Catalonia
,
with
all
the
troop
that
he
could
gather
together
,
leave
in
Valencia
a
small
Body
of
Foot
,
such
as
in
that
Exigence
could
best
be
spar'd
.
<EOS>
the
whole
Body
thus
collect
make
very
little
more
than
two
thousand
Foot
and
six
hundred
Horse
;
yet
resolutely
with
these
he
set
out
for
Barcelona
:
<EOS>
in
the
Neighbourhood
of
which
,
as
soon
as
he
arriv'd
,
he
take
care
to
post
himself
and
his
diminutive
Army
in
the
mountain
which
inviron
that
City
;
where
he
not
only
secur'd
'em
against
the
Enemy
;
but
find
himself
in
a
capacity
of
put
him
under
perpetual
Alarms
.
<EOS>
nor
be
the
Mareschal
,
with
his
great
Army
,
capable
of
return
the
Earl
's
Compliment
of
Disturbance
;
since
he
himself
,
every
six
or
eight
hour
,
put
his
troop
into
such
a
varying
situation
,
that
always
when
most
arduously
fight
,
he
be
farth
off
from
be
find
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
the
General
bitterly
harrass'd
the
troop
of
the
enemy
;
and
by
these
Means
strike
a
perpetual
Terror
into
the
Besiegers
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
only
this
way
annoy
the
Enemy
;
the
Precautions
he
have
us'd
,
and
the
Measures
he
have
take
in
other
Places
,
with
a
view
to
prevent
their
return
to
Madrid
,
though
the
invidious
endeavour'd
to
bury
them
in
Oblivion
,
<EOS>
have
equally
contribute
to
the
driving
of
the
Mareschal
of
France
,
and
his
Catholick
King
,
out
of
the
Spanish
Dominions
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
go
on
with
the
Siege
:
the
Breaches
in
the
wall
of
that
City
,
during
its
Siege
by
the
Earl
,
have
be
put
into
tolerable
repair
;
but
those
of
Monjouick
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
be
as
much
neglect
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
Garrison
make
shift
to
hold
out
a
Battery
of
twenty
-
three
Days
,
with
no
less
than
fifty
piece
of
Cannon
;
when
,
after
a
loss
of
the
Enemy
of
upward
of
three
thousand
Men
(
a
Moiety
of
the
Army
employ'd
<EOS>
against
it
when
the
Earl
take
it
)
they
be
forc'd
to
surrender
at
Discretion
.
<EOS>
and
this
can
not
but
merit
our
Observation
,
that
a
Place
,
which
the
English
General
take
in
little
more
than
an
hour
,
and
with
inconsiderable
Loss
,
afford
the
Mareschal
of
France
a
Resistance
of
twenty
-
three
Days
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
taking
of
Fort
Monjouick
,
the
Mareschal
de
Thess
give
immediate
Orders
for
battery
to
be
rais'd
against
the
Town
.
<EOS>
those
order
be
put
in
execution
with
all
expedition
;
and
at
the
same
time
his
Army
fortify'd
themselves
with
such
entrenchment
,
as
would
have
ruin'd
the
Earl
's
former
little
Army
to
have
rais'd
,
or
his
present
much
less
Army
to
have
attempt
the
force
them
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
sufficiently
demonstrate
their
apprehension
of
that
watchful
General
,
who
lie
hover
over
their
head
upon
the
Mountains
.
<EOS>
Their
main
effort
be
to
make
a
Breach
between
Port
St.
Antonio
and
that
Breach
which
our
force
have
make
the
year
before
;
to
effect
which
they
take
care
to
ply
them
very
diligently
both
from
Cannon
and
Mortars
;
and
in
some
few
day
their
application
be
answer'd
with
a
practicable
Breach
for
a
Storm
.
<EOS>
which
however
be
prudently
deferr'd
<EOS>
for
some
time
,
and
that
thro
'
fear
of
the
Earl
's
fall
on
the
back
of
them
whenever
they
should
attempt
it
;
which
,
consequently
,
they
be
sensible
may
put
them
into
some
dangerous
disorder
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
it
be
that
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
resolv'd
to
put
in
practice
the
Resolution
<EOS>
he
have
some
time
before
concert
within
himself
.
<EOS>
about
nine
or
ten
day
before
the
raising
of
the
Siege
,
he
have
receiv'd
<EOS>
an
Express
from
Brigadier
Stanhope
(
who
be
aboard
<EOS>
Sir
John
Leake
's
Fleet
appoint
for
the
Relief
of
the
Place
,
with
the
Reinforcements
from
England
)
acquaint
the
Earl
,
that
he
have
us'd
all
possible
Endeavours
to
prevail
on
the
Admiral
to
make
the
good
of
his
way
to
Barcelona
.
<EOS>
but
that
the
Admiral
,
however
,
persist
in
a
positive
Resolution
not
to
attempt
the
French
Fleet
before
that
place
under
the
Count
de
Thoulouse
,
till
the
ship
be
join'd
him
which
be
expect
from
Ireland
,
under
the
Command
of
Sir
George
Bing
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
the
Fleet
under
Admiral
Leake
be
of
equal
Strength
with
that
under
the
French
Admiral
;
but
jealous
of
the
Informations
he
have
receiv'd
,
and
too
ready
to
conclude
that
People
in
Distress
be
apt
to
make
representation
too
much
in
their
own
favour
;
he
hold
himself
,
in
point
of
Discretion
,
oblig'd
not
to
hazard
the
Queen
's
Ships
,
when
a
reinforcement
of
both
cleaner
and
large
be
under
daily
Expectation
.
  
<EOS>
this
unhappy
Circumstance
(
notwithstanding
all
former
glorious
Deliverances
)
have
almost
bring
the
Earl
to
the
Brink
of
despair
;
and
to
increase
it
,
the
Earl
every
day
<EOS>
receiv'd
<EOS>
such
command
from
the
King
within
the
Place
,
as
must
have
sacrifice
his
few
Forces
,
without
the
least
probability
of
succeed
.
<EOS>
those
all
tend
to
his
force
his
way
into
the
Town
;
when
,
in
all
human
appearance
,
not
one
man
of
all
that
should
make
the
Attempt
could
have
do
it
,
with
any
Hope
or
Prospect
of
survive
.
<EOS>
the
French
be
strongly
encamp'd
<EOS>
at
the
Foot
of
the
Mountains
,
distant
two
mile
from
Barcelona
;
towards
the
Bottom
of
those
Hills
,
the
Avenues
into
the
Plain
be
possess'd
and
fortify'd
by
great
detachment
from
the
Enemy
's
Army
.
<EOS>
from
all
which
it
will
be
evident
,
that
no
Attempt
could
be
make
without
give
the
Enemy
time
to
draw
together
what
Body
of
Foot
they
pleas'd
.
<EOS>
or
suppose
it
feasible
,
under
all
these
difficult
circumstance
,
for
some
of
them
to
have
forc'd
their
passage
,
the
Remainder
,
that
should
have
be
so
lucky
to
have
escap'd
<EOS>
their
Foot
,
would
have
find
themselves
expos'd
in
open
field
to
a
Pursuit
of
four
thousand
Horse
and
Dragoons
;
and
that
for
two
mile
together
;
when
in
case
of
their
inclose
them
,
the
brave
troop
in
the
World
,
under
such
a
situation
,
would
have
find
it
their
good
way
to
have
surrender'd
themselves
Prisoners
of
War
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
when
Brigadier
Stanhope
send
that
Express
to
the
Earl
,
which
I
just
now
mention'd
,
he
assur'd
him
in
the
same
,
that
he
would
use
his
utmost
diligence
,
both
by
Sea
and
Land
,
to
let
him
have
timely
Notice
of
the
Conjunction
of
the
fleet
,
which
be
now
all
they
have
to
depend
upon
.
<EOS>
add
withal
,
that
if
the
Earl
should
at
any
time
receive
a
letter
,
or
Paper
,
though
direct
to
no
body
,
and
with
nothing
in
it
,
but
a
half
Sheet
of
Paper
cut
in
the
Middle
,
he
,
the
Earl
,
may
certainly
depend
upon
it
,
that
the
two
fleet
be
join'd
,
and
make
the
good
of
their
way
for
Barcelona
.
<EOS>
It
will
easily
be
imagin'd
<EOS>
the
Express
be
to
be
well
pay
;
and
be
make
sensible
that
he
run
little
or
no
Hazard
in
carry
a
Piece
of
blank
Paper
,
he
undertake
it
,
and
as
fortunately
arriv'd
<EOS>
with
it
to
the
Earl
,
at
a
Moment
when
Chagrin
and
Despair
may
have
hurry'd
him
to
some
Resolution
that
may
have
prov'd
fatal
.
<EOS>
the
Messenger
himself
,
however
,
know
nothing
of
the
Joining
of
the
Fleets
,
or
the
Meaning
of
his
message
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
Earl
of
peterborow
receiv'd
<EOS>
this
welcome
message
from
Brigadier
Stanhope
,
he
<EOS>
march'd
<EOS>
the
very
same
night
,
with
his
whole
little
body
of
Forces
,
to
a
Town
on
the
Sea
-
Shore
,
call'd
Sigeth
.
<EOS>
no
person
guess'd
<EOS>
the
reason
of
his
March
,
or
know
any
thing
of
what
the
intent
of
it
be
.
<EOS>
the
Officers
,
as
formerly
,
obey'd
without
Enquiry
;
for
they
be
lead
to
it
by
so
many
unaccountable
variety
of
Success
,
that
Affiance
become
a
second
nature
,
both
in
Officer
and
Soldier
.
  
<EOS>
the
Town
of
Sigeth
be
about
seven
league
to
the
Westward
of
Barcelona
;
where
,
as
soon
as
the
Earl
with
his
force
arriv'd
,
he
take
care
to
secure
all
the
small
fishing
-
Boats
,
Feluccas
,
and
sattee
;
nay
,
in
a
Word
,
every
machine
in
which
he
could
transport
any
of
his
man
:
<EOS>
so
that
in
two
day
'
time
he
have
get
together
a
Number
sufficient
for
the
Conveyance
of
all
his
Foot
.
  
<EOS>
but
a
day
or
two
before
the
arrival
of
the
English
Fleet
off
Sigeth
,
the
Officers
of
his
troop
be
under
a
strange
consternation
at
a
Resolution
their
General
have
take
.
<EOS>
impatient
of
Delay
,
and
fearful
of
the
fleet
pass
by
without
his
Knowledge
,
the
Earl
<EOS>
summon'd
<EOS>
them
together
a
little
before
Night
,
at
which
time
he
discover'd
<EOS>
to
the
whole
Assembly
,
that
he
himself
be
oblig'd
to
endeavour
to
get
aboard
the
English
Fleet
;
and
that
,
if
possible
,
before
the
french
scout
should
be
able
to
make
any
Discovery
of
their
strength
:
<EOS>
that
find
himself
of
no
further
Use
on
Shore
,
have
already
take
the
necessary
Precautions
for
their
Transportation
and
Security
,
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
pursue
his
order
,
and
make
the
good
of
their
way
to
Barcelona
,
in
the
Vessels
which
he
have
provide
for
them
:
that
they
may
do
this
in
perfect
security
when
they
see
the
English
Fleet
pass
by
;
or
if
they
should
pass
by
in
the
Night
,
an
Engagement
with
the
French
,
which
would
give
them
sufficient
notice
what
they
have
to
do
further
.
  
<EOS>
this
Declaration
,
instead
of
satisfy
,
make
the
officer
ten
time
more
curious
:
<EOS>
but
when
they
see
their
General
go
with
a
resolution
to
lie
out
all
Night
at
Sea
,
in
an
open
Boat
,
attend
with
only
one
officer
;
and
understand
that
he
intend
to
row
out
in
his
Felucca
five
or
six
league
distance
from
the
Shore
,
it
be
hardly
to
be
express'd
what
Amazement
and
Concern
surpriz'd
them
all
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crow
,
the
Queen
's
Minister
,
and
other
,
express'd
a
particular
Dislike
and
Uneasiness
;
but
all
to
no
purpose
,
the
Earl
have
resolv'd
upon
it
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
at
Night
he
put
out
to
Sea
in
his
open
Felucca
,
all
which
he
spend
five
league
from
Shore
,
with
no
other
Company
than
one
Captain
and
his
rower
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
all
,
officer
and
other
,
the
Earl
come
again
to
land
;
and
immediately
begin
to
put
his
Men
into
the
several
vessel
which
lie
ready
in
Port
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
but
at
Night
their
Amaze
be
renew'd
,
when
they
find
their
general
ready
to
put
in
execution
his
old
Resolution
,
in
the
same
equipage
,
and
with
the
same
attendance
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
again
felucca'd
himself
;
and
they
see
him
no
more
till
they
be
land
on
the
Mole
in
Barcelona
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
first
engag'd
himself
in
the
Expedition
to
Spain
,
he
propos'd
to
the
Queen
and
her
Ministry
,
that
Admiral
Shovel
may
be
join'd
in
Commission
with
him
in
the
Command
of
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
but
this
year
,
when
the
Fleet
come
through
the
Straites
,
under
Vice
-
Admiral
Leake
,
the
Queen
have
send
a
Commission
to
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
for
the
full
Command
,
whenever
he
think
fit
to
come
aboard
in
Person
.
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
it
be
that
make
the
General
endeavour
,
at
all
Hazards
,
to
get
aboard
the
Fleet
by
Night
;
for
he
be
apprehensive
,
and
the
Sequel
prov'd
<EOS>
his
apprehension
too
well
ground
,
that
Admiral
Leake
would
make
his
appearance
with
the
whole
body
of
the
Fleet
,
which
make
near
twice
the
Number
of
the
ship
of
the
Enemy
;
in
which
case
it
be
natural
to
suppose
,
that
the
Count
de
Tholouse
,
as
soon
as
ever
the
french
scout
should
give
Notice
of
our
Strength
,
<EOS>
would
cut
his
cable
and
put
out
to
Sea
,
to
avoid
an
Engagement
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
Earl
be
very
sensible
,
that
if
a
part
of
his
ship
have
keep
a
-
stern
,
that
the
Superiority
may
have
appear'd
<EOS>
on
the
french
side
,
or
rather
if
they
have
bear
away
in
the
night
towards
the
Coast
of
Africa
,
and
fall
to
the
Eastward
of
Barcelona
the
next
Day
,
a
Battle
have
be
inevitable
,
and
a
victory
equally
certain
;
since
the
Enemy
by
this
Means
have
be
tempt
into
an
Engagement
,
and
their
retreat
be
cut
off
,
and
their
whole
Fleet
surround
with
almost
double
their
number
,
there
have
hardly
be
leave
for
any
of
them
a
probability
of
Escaping
.
  
<EOS>
therefore
,
when
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
put
to
Sea
again
the
second
evening
,
fearful
of
loose
such
a
glorious
opportunity
,
and
impatient
to
be
aboard
to
give
the
necessary
Orders
,
he
order'd
his
rower
to
obtain
the
same
Station
,
in
order
to
discover
the
English
Fleet
.
<EOS>
and
accord
to
his
Wishes
he
do
fall
in
with
it
;
but
unfortunately
the
Night
be
so
far
advanc'd
,
that
it
be
impossible
for
him
then
to
put
his
Project
into
practice
.
<EOS>
Captain
Price
,
a
Gentleman
of
Wales
,
who
command
a
Third
Rate
,
be
the
person
he
first
come
aboard
of
;
but
how
amaz'd
be
he
to
find
,
in
an
open
Boat
at
open
Sea
,
the
person
who
have
Commission
to
command
the
Fleet
?
<EOS>
so
soon
as
he
be
enter'd
<EOS>
the
Ship
,
the
Earl
send
the
ship
's
Pinnace
with
letter
to
Admiral
Leake
,
to
acquaint
him
with
his
Orders
and
Intentions
;
and
to
Brigadier
Stanhope
with
a
notification
of
his
safe
arrival
;
but
the
darkness
of
the
Night
prov'd
so
great
an
Obstacle
,
that
it
be
a
long
time
before
the
Pinnace
could
reach
the
admiral
.
<EOS>
when
Day
appear'd
,
it
be
astonishing
to
the
whole
Fleet
to
see
the
Union
Flag
wave
at
the
main
-
top
-
mast
head
.
<EOS>
no
body
could
trust
his
own
eye
,
or
guess
at
the
meaning
,
till
better
certify'd
<EOS>
by
the
Account
of
an
event
<EOS>
so
singular
and
extraordinary
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
about
six
Leagues
Distance
from
Barcelona
,
the
Port
we
aim'd
at
,
one
of
the
french
scout
give
the
Alarm
,
who
make
the
Signal
to
another
,
he
communicate
it
to
a
Third
,
and
so
on
,
as
we
afterward
sorrowfully
find
,
and
as
the
Earl
have
before
apprehend
:
the
French
Admiral
be
thus
make
acquainted
with
the
Force
of
our
Fleet
,
hoisted
sail
,
and
make
the
good
of
his
way
from
us
,
either
pursuant
to
order
,
or
under
the
plausible
Excuse
of
a
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
this
favourable
opportunity
thus
lose
,
there
remain'd
nothing
to
do
but
to
land
the
troop
with
all
Expedition
;
which
be
execute
accordingly
:
<EOS>
the
Regiments
,
which
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
embark'd
<EOS>
the
night
before
,
be
the
first
that
get
into
the
Town
.
<EOS>
let
the
Reader
imagine
how
pleasing
such
a
Sight
must
be
to
those
in
Barcelona
,
reduc'd
as
they
be
to
the
last
extremity
.
<EOS>
in
this
Condition
,
to
see
an
Enemy
's
Fleet
give
way
to
another
with
Reinforcements
from
England
,
the
Sea
at
the
same
instant
<EOS>
cover'd
with
little
Vessels
croude
with
great
Succours
;
what
be
there
want
to
compleat
the
glorious
Scene
,
but
what
the
General
have
project
,
a
Fight
at
Sea
,
under
the
very
Walls
of
the
invest
City
,
and
the
Ships
of
the
Enemy
sinking
,
or
tow'd
in
by
the
victorious
English
?
<EOS>
but
Night
,
and
a
few
Hours
,
defeat
the
latter
part
of
that
well
intend
Landskip
.
  
<EOS>
King
Philip
,
and
the
Mareschal
of
France
,
have
not
fail'd
to
push
on
the
Siege
with
all
imaginable
vigour
;
but
this
retreat
of
the
Count
de
Tholouse
,
and
the
News
of
those
reinforcement
,
soon
chang'd
<EOS>
the
Scene
.
<EOS>
Their
courage
without
be
abate
proportionably
,
as
theirs
within
be
elate
.
<EOS>
in
these
circumstance
,
a
Council
of
War
be
call'd
,
it
be
unanimously
resolv'd
to
raise
the
Siege
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
next
morning
,
the
first
of
May
,
1706
,
while
the
Sun
be
under
a
total
Eclypse
,
in
a
suitable
Hurry
and
Confusion
,
they
break
up
,
leave
behind
them
most
of
their
Cannon
and
Mortars
,
together
with
vast
quantity
of
all
sort
of
Ammunition
and
Provisions
,
scarce
stopping
to
look
back
till
they
have
leave
all
but
the
very
verge
of
the
dispute
Dominion
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
King
Charles
<EOS>
look'd
<EOS>
with
new
Pleasure
upon
this
lucky
Effort
of
his
old
Deliverers
.
<EOS>
Captivity
be
a
state
no
way
desirable
to
person
however
brave
,
of
the
most
private
Station
in
Life
;
but
for
a
king
,
within
two
day
of
fall
into
the
Hands
of
his
rival
,
to
receive
so
seasonable
and
unexpecte
a
deliverance
,
must
be
suppose
,
as
it
really
do
,
to
open
a
scene
to
universal
rejoicing
among
us
,
too
high
for
any
Words
to
express
,
or
any
thought
to
imagine
,
to
those
that
be
not
present
and
partaker
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
forthwith
give
order
for
a
medal
to
be
strike
suitable
to
the
Occasion
;
one
of
which
,
set
round
with
diamond
,
he
present
to
Sir
John
Leake
,
the
English
Admiral
.
<EOS>
the
next
Orders
be
for
re
-
cast
all
the
damag'd
brass
Cannon
which
the
Enemy
have
leave
;
upon
every
one
of
which
be
,
by
order
,
a
Sun
eclyps'd
,
with
this
Motto
under
it
:
Magna
parvi
obscurantur
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
wonder'd
that
I
never
hear
any
Body
curious
enough
to
enquire
what
could
be
the
motive
to
the
King
of
Spain
's
quit
his
dominion
upon
the
raising
of
this
siege
;
very
certain
it
be
that
he
have
a
fine
Army
,
under
the
Command
of
a
Mareschal
of
France
,
not
very
considerably
decreas'd
,
either
by
action
or
desertion
:
<EOS>
but
all
this
would
rather
increase
the
curiosity
than
abate
it
.
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
then
,
though
man
may
have
Curiosity
enough
,
the
Question
be
purposely
evade
,
under
an
apprehension
that
an
honest
answer
must
inevitably
give
a
high
idea
of
the
General
than
their
inclination
lead
them
to
.
<EOS>
at
first
View
this
may
carry
the
face
of
a
Paradox
;
yet
if
the
Reader
will
consider
,
that
in
every
Age
Virtue
have
have
its
Shaders
or
Maligners
,
he
will
himself
easily
solve
it
,
at
the
same
time
that
he
find
himself
compell'd
to
allow
,
that
those
,
who
find
themselves
unable
to
prevent
his
great
Services
,
be
willing
,
in
a
more
subtil
Manner
,
to
endeavour
at
the
annulling
of
them
by
Silence
and
Concealment
.
  
<EOS>
this
will
appear
more
than
bare
Supposition
,
if
we
compare
the
present
situation
,
as
to
Strength
,
of
the
two
contend
Powers
:
<EOS>
the
French
,
at
the
Birth
of
the
Siege
,
consist
of
five
thousand
Horse
and
Dragoons
,
and
twenty
-
five
thousand
Foot
,
effective
man
.
<EOS>
now
grant
,
that
their
kill'd
and
wound
,
together
with
their
Sick
in
the
hospital
,
may
amount
to
five
thousand
;
yet
as
their
Body
of
Horse
be
entire
,
and
in
the
good
condition
,
the
Remaining
will
appear
to
be
an
Army
of
twenty
-
five
thousand
at
least
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
,
all
the
Forces
in
Barcelona
,
even
with
their
reinforcement
,
amount
to
no
more
than
seven
thousand
Foot
and
four
hundred
horse
.
<EOS>
why
then
,
when
they
rais'd
their
Siege
,
do
not
they
march
back
into
the
Heart
of
Spain
,
with
their
so
much
superior
Army
?
<EOS>
or
,
at
least
,
towards
their
capital
?
<EOS>
the
answer
can
be
this
,
and
this
only
;
because
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
have
take
such
provident
Care
to
render
all
secure
,
that
it
be
thereby
render'd
<EOS>
next
to
an
impossibility
for
them
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
that
General
be
satisfy'd
,
that
the
Capital
of
Catalonia
must
,
in
course
,
fall
into
the
Hands
of
the
Enemy
,
unless
a
superior
Fleet
remov'd
the
Count
de
Tholouse
,
and
throw
in
timely
Succours
into
the
Town
:
<EOS>
and
as
that
could
not
depend
upon
him
,
but
other
<EOS>
,
he
make
it
his
chief
care
and
assiduous
Employment
to
provide
against
those
Strokes
of
Fortune
to
which
he
find
himself
again
likely
to
be
expos'd
,
as
he
often
have
be
;
and
therefore
have
he
Resource
to
that
Vigilance
and
Precaution
which
have
often
<EOS>
retriev'd
<EOS>
him
,
when
to
other
his
circumstance
seem'd
to
be
most
desperate
.
  
<EOS>
the
Generality
of
Mankind
,
and
the
French
in
particular
,
be
of
opinion
that
the
take
Barcelona
would
prove
a
decisive
stroke
,
and
put
a
period
to
the
War
in
Spain
;
and
yet
at
that
very
instant
<EOS>
I
be
inclin'd
to
believe
,
that
the
General
flatter'd
himself
<EOS>
it
would
be
in
his
Power
to
give
the
Enemy
sufficient
Mortification
,
even
though
the
Town
should
be
oblig'd
to
submit
to
King
Philip
.
<EOS>
the
wise
measure
take
induc'd
<EOS>
me
so
to
believe
,
and
the
Sequel
approv'd
<EOS>
it
;
for
the
Earl
have
so
well
expend
his
caution
,
that
the
Enemy
,
on
the
Disappointment
,
find
himself
under
a
necessity
of
quit
Spain
;
and
the
same
would
have
put
him
under
equal
difficulty
<EOS>
have
he
carry'd
<EOS>
the
Place
.
<EOS>
the
French
could
never
have
undertake
that
Siege
without
depend
on
their
Fleet
,
for
their
Artillery
,
ammunition
,
and
provision
;
since
they
must
be
inevitably
forc'd
to
leave
behind
them
the
strong
town
of
Tortosa
,
Lerida
,
and
Taragona
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
,
therefore
,
whose
perpetual
difficulty
seem'd
rather
to
render
him
more
sprightly
and
vigorous
,
take
care
himself
to
examine
the
whole
country
between
the
Ebro
and
Barcelona
;
and
,
upon
his
do
so
,
be
pleasingly
,
as
well
as
sensibly
satisfy'd
,
that
it
be
practicable
to
render
their
return
into
the
Heart
of
Spain
impossible
,
whether
they
do
or
do
not
succeed
in
the
Siege
they
be
so
intent
to
undertake
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
but
three
way
they
could
attempt
it
:
the
first
of
which
be
by
the
Sea
-
side
,
from
Taragona
towards
Tortosa
;
the
most
barren
,
and
consequently
the
most
improper
Country
in
the
Universe
to
sustain
an
Army
;
and
yet
to
the
natural
,
the
Earl
have
add
such
artificial
difficulty
,
as
render'd
it
absolutely
impossible
for
an
Army
to
subsist
or
march
that
Way
.
  
<EOS>
the
middle
Way
lie
through
a
well
Country
indeed
,
yet
only
practicable
by
the
Care
which
have
be
take
to
make
the
road
so
.
<EOS>
and
even
here
there
be
a
necessity
of
marching
along
the
side
of
a
Mountain
,
where
by
vast
Labour
and
Industry
,
a
high
way
have
be
cut
for
two
mile
at
least
out
of
the
main
Rock
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
therefore
,
by
somewhat
of
the
same
Labour
,
soon
make
it
impassable
.
<EOS>
He
employ'd
to
that
end
many
thousand
of
the
Country
People
<EOS>
,
under
a
few
of
his
own
officer
and
troop
,
who
cut
up
twenty
several
Places
,
make
so
many
Precipices
,
perpendicular
almost
as
a
Wall
,
which
render'd
it
neither
safe
,
or
even
to
be
attempt
by
any
single
man
in
his
Wits
,
much
less
by
an
Army
.
<EOS>
besides
,
a
very
few
man
,
from
the
high
cliff
of
the
Mountain
,
may
have
destroy'd
an
Army
with
the
arm
of
Nature
only
,
by
roll
down
large
Stones
and
piece
of
the
Rock
upon
the
Enemy
pass
below
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
and
uppermost
way
,
lie
thro
'
the
hilly
Part
of
Catalonia
,
and
lead
to
Lerida
,
towards
the
Head
of
the
Ebro
,
the
strong
place
we
have
in
all
Spain
,
and
which
be
as
well
furnish'd
with
a
very
good
Garrison
.
<EOS>
along
this
Road
there
lie
many
old
castle
and
little
town
in
the
Mountains
,
naturally
strong
;
all
which
would
not
only
have
afford
opposition
,
but
at
the
same
time
have
entertain'd
an
enemy
with
variety
of
difficulty
;
and
especially
as
the
Earl
have
give
Orders
and
take
Care
that
all
Cattle
,
and
every
Thing
necessary
to
sustain
an
Army
,
should
be
convey'd
into
Places
of
Security
,
either
in
the
Mountains
or
thereabout
.
<EOS>
these
three
Ways
thus
precautiously
secur'd
,
what
have
the
Earl
to
apprehend
but
the
safety
of
the
Arch
-
Duke
;
which
yet
be
through
no
default
of
his
,
if
in
any
Danger
from
the
Siege
?
  
<EOS>
for
I
<EOS>
well
remember
,
on
Receipt
of
an
Express
from
the
Duke
of
Savoy
(
as
he
frequenly
send
such
to
enquire
after
the
Proceedings
in
Spain
)
<EOS>
I
be
shew'd
<EOS>
a
letter
,
write
about
this
time
by
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
to
that
Prince
,
which
rais'd
<EOS>
my
spirit
,
though
then
at
a
very
low
Ebb
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
remarkable
to
be
forget
;
and
the
substance
of
it
be
,
that
his
Highness
may
depend
upon
it
,
that
he
(
the
Earl
)
be
in
much
well
circumstance
than
he
be
think
to
be
:
that
the
French
Officers
,
know
nothing
of
the
situation
of
the
Country
,
would
find
themselves
extreamly
disappoint
,
since
in
case
the
Siege
be
rais'd
,
their
Army
should
be
oblig'd
to
abandon
Spain
:
or
in
case
the
Town
be
take
,
they
should
find
themselves
shut
up
in
that
Corner
of
Catalonia
,
and
under
an
impossibility
of
force
their
way
back
,
either
through
Aragon
or
Valencia
:
<EOS>
that
by
this
mean
all
Spain
,
to
the
Ebro
,
would
be
open
to
the
Lord
Galoway
,
who
may
march
to
Madrid
,
or
any
where
else
,
without
Opposition
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
no
other
Uneasiness
or
concern
upon
him
,
but
for
the
Person
of
the
Arch
-
Duke
,
whom
he
have
nevertheless
earnestly
solicit
not
to
remain
in
the
Town
on
the
very
first
appearance
of
the
intend
Siege
.
  
<EOS>
BARCELONA
be
thus
reliev'd
,
and
King
Philip
forc'd
out
of
Spain
,
by
these
cautious
step
take
by
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
before
we
bring
him
to
Valencia
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
intimate
,
that
as
it
always
be
the
Custom
of
that
General
to
settle
,
by
a
Council
of
War
,
all
the
measure
to
be
take
,
whenever
he
be
oblig'd
for
the
Service
to
leave
the
Arch
-
Duke
;
a
Council
of
War
be
now
accordingly
hold
,
where
all
the
General
Officers
,
and
those
in
great
employment
at
court
assist
.
<EOS>
here
every
thing
be
in
the
most
solemn
Manner
concert
and
resolv'd
upon
;
here
garrison
be
settle
for
all
the
strong
Places
,
and
Governors
appoint
:
but
the
main
article
then
agree
upon
be
,
that
King
Charles
should
immediately
begin
his
Journey
to
Madrid
,
and
that
by
the
Way
of
Valencia
.
<EOS>
the
Reason
assign'd
<EOS>
for
it
be
,
because
that
Kingdom
be
in
his
Possession
,
no
difficulty
could
arise
which
may
occasion
Delay
,
if
his
Majesty
take
that
Rout
.
<EOS>
It
be
likewise
agree
in
the
same
Council
,
that
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
should
embark
all
the
Foot
,
not
in
Garrisons
,
for
their
more
speedy
,
as
well
as
more
easy
conveyance
to
Valencia
.
<EOS>
the
same
Council
of
War
agree
,
that
all
the
Horse
in
that
Kingdom
should
be
draw
together
,
the
well
to
insure
the
measure
to
be
take
for
the
opening
and
facilitate
his
Majesty
's
progress
to
Madrid
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
after
these
resolution
be
take
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
embark
his
Forces
and
sail
for
Valencia
,
where
he
be
doubly
welcom'd
by
all
sort
of
People
upon
Account
of
his
safe
arrival
,
and
the
News
he
bring
along
with
it
.
<EOS>
by
the
Joy
they
express'd
,
one
would
have
imagin'd
that
the
General
have
escap'd
<EOS>
the
same
Danger
with
the
king
;
and
,
in
truth
,
have
their
King
arriv'd
<EOS>
with
him
in
Person
,
the
most
loyal
and
zealous
would
have
find
themselves
at
a
loss
how
to
have
express'd
<EOS>
their
satisfaction
in
a
more
sensible
manner
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
his
landing
,
with
his
customary
vivacity
,
he
apply'd
<EOS>
himself
to
put
in
execution
the
Resolutions
take
in
the
council
of
War
at
Barcelona
;
and
a
little
to
improve
upon
them
,
he
rais'd
<EOS>
an
intire
regiment
of
Dragoons
,
buy
them
horse
,
provide
them
cloath
,
arm
,
and
acoutrement
;
and
in
six
Weeks
time
have
them
ready
to
take
the
field
;
a
thing
though
hardly
to
be
parallell'd
,
be
yet
scarce
worthy
to
be
mention
among
so
many
noble
action
of
his
;
yet
in
regard
to
another
General
it
may
merit
Notice
,
since
while
he
have
Madrid
in
Possession
near
four
month
,
he
neither
augment
his
troop
,
nor
lay'd
up
any
magazine
;
neither
send
he
all
that
time
any
one
Express
to
concert
any
measure
with
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
but
lie
under
a
perfect
inactivity
,
or
which
be
bad
,
negotiate
that
unfortunate
Project
of
carry
King
Charles
to
Madrid
by
the
roundabout
and
ill
-
concert
Way
of
Aragon
;
a
Project
not
only
contrary
to
the
solemn
Resolutions
of
the
Council
of
War
;
but
which
in
reality
be
the
Root
of
all
our
succeed
misfortune
;
and
that
only
for
the
wretched
vanity
of
appear
to
have
have
some
share
in
bring
the
king
to
his
capital
;
but
how
minute
a
share
<EOS>
it
be
will
be
manifest
,
if
it
be
consider'd
that
another
General
have
first
make
the
way
easy
,
by
drive
the
Enemy
out
of
Spain
;
and
that
the
French
General
only
stay'd
at
Madrid
till
the
return
of
those
troop
which
be
in
a
manner
drive
out
of
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
that
Transaction
,
doughty
as
it
be
,
take
up
four
most
precious
month
,
which
most
certainly
may
have
be
much
well
employ'd
in
render
it
impossible
for
the
Enemy
to
re
-
enter
Spain
;
nor
have
there
be
any
Great
Difficulty
in
so
do
,
but
the
contrary
,
if
the
General
at
Madrid
have
think
convenient
to
have
join'd
<EOS>
the
troop
under
the
Earl
of
Peterhorow
,
and
then
to
have
march'd
<EOS>
directly
towards
Pampelona
,
or
the
Frontiers
of
France
.
<EOS>
to
this
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
solicit
the
King
,
and
those
about
him
;
he
advis'd
,
desir'd
,
and
intreate
him
to
lose
no
time
,
but
to
put
in
execution
those
measure
resolv'd
on
at
Barcelona
.
<EOS>
a
Council
of
War
in
Valencia
renew'd
<EOS>
the
same
application
;
but
all
to
no
purpose
,
his
rout
be
order'd
<EOS>
him
,
and
that
to
meet
his
Majesty
on
the
Frontiers
of
Arragon
.
<EOS>
there
,
indeed
,
the
Earl
do
meet
the
King
;
and
the
French
General
an
Army
,
which
,
by
Virtue
of
a
decrepid
Intelligence
,
he
never
see
or
hear
of
till
he
flee
from
it
to
his
Camp
at
Guadalira
.
<EOS>
inexpressible
with
the
Confusion
in
this
fatal
camp
:
<EOS>
the
king
from
Arragon
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
from
Valencia
arrive
in
it
the
same
day
,
almost
the
same
hour
that
the
Earl
of
Galoway
enter'd
under
a
hasty
Retreat
before
the
french
Army
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
Order
,
which
a
Zeal
of
Justice
have
make
me
somewhat
anticipate
;
the
Earl
have
not
be
long
at
Valencia
before
he
give
order
to
Major
-
General
Windham
to
march
with
all
the
force
he
have
,
which
be
not
above
two
thousand
Men
,
and
lie
Siege
to
Requina
,
a
Town
ten
Leagues
distant
from
Valencia
,
and
in
the
way
to
Madrid
.
<EOS>
the
Town
be
not
very
strong
,
nor
very
large
;
but
<EOS>
sure
the
odliest
<EOS>
fortify'd
that
ever
be
.
<EOS>
the
Houses
in
a
Circle
conneftively
compos'd
the
Wall
;
and
the
People
,
who
defend
the
Town
,
instead
of
fire
from
Hornworks
,
Counterscarps
,
and
bastion
,
fir'd
out
of
the
window
of
their
house
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
which
,
General
Windham
find
much
great
opposition
than
he
at
first
imagin'd
;
and
therefore
find
he
should
want
Ammunition
,
he
send
to
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
for
a
supply
;
at
the
same
time
assign
,
as
a
reason
for
it
,
the
unexpected
Obstinacy
of
the
Town
.
<EOS>
so
soon
as
the
Earl
receiv'd
<EOS>
the
letter
he
send
for
me
;
and
tell
me
I
must
repair
to
Requifia
,
where
they
would
want
an
Engineer
;
and
that
I
must
be
ready
next
Morning
,
when
he
should
order
a
Lieutenant
,
with
thirty
soldier
and
two
matrosse
,
to
guard
some
Powder
for
that
Service
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
next
morning
we
set
out
,
the
Lieutenant
,
who
be
a
dutchman
,
and
Commander
of
the
Convoy
,
be
of
my
Acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
reach'd
<EOS>
Saint
Jago
,
a
small
Village
about
midway
between
Valencia
and
Requina
,
when
the
Officer
,
just
as
he
be
get
without
the
Town
,
resolve
to
take
up
his
Quarters
on
the
Spot
,
order'd
<EOS>
the
Mules
to
be
unload

<EOS>
the

which
consist

forty

five
Barrels

be
pil'd
up
in
a
circle
,
and
cover'd
with
oil

cloth
,
to
preserve
it
from
the
Weather
;
and
though
we
have
agree
to
sup
together
at
my
quarter
within
the
village
,
yet
be
weary
and
fatigu'd
,
he
order'd
his
Field
-
Bed
to
be
put
up
near
the
Powder
,
and
so
lay
down
to
take
a
short
Nap
.
<EOS>
I
have
scarce
be
at
my
quarter
<EOS>
an
Hour
,
when
a
sudden
shock
attack'd
<EOS>
the
House
so
violently
,
that
it
throw
down
Tiles
,
Windows
,
Chimneys
and
all
.
<EOS>
It
presently
come
into
my
Head
what
be
the
Occasion
;
and
as
my
fear
suggest
so
it
prov'd
:
<EOS>
for
run
to
the
Door
I
see
a
Cloud
ascend
from
the
Spot
<EOS>
I
leave
the
Powder
pitch'd
upon
.
<EOS>
in
haste
make
up
to
which
,
nothing
be
to
be
see
but
the
bare
Circle
upon
which
it
have
stand
.
<EOS>
the
Bed
be
blow
quite
away
,
and
the
poor
Lieutenant
all
to
piece
,
several
of
his
Limbs
be
find
separate
,
and
at
a
vast
Distance
each
from
the
other
;
and
particularly
an
Arm
,
with
a
ring
on
one
of
the
Fingers
.
<EOS>
the
Matrosses
be
,
if
possible
,
in
a
yet
bad
condition
,
that
is
,
as
to
Manglement
and
Laceration
.
<EOS>
all
the
soldier
who
be
stand
,
and
any
thing
near
,
be
strike
dead
.
<EOS>
only
such
as
lie
sleep
on
the
ground
escap'd
,
and
of
those
one
<EOS>
assur'd
<EOS>
me
,
that
the
blast
remov'd
him
several
Foot
from
his
Place
of
Repose
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
enquire
into
this
deplorable
Disaster
,
I
have
this
account
:
<EOS>
that
a
Pig
run
out
of
the
Town
,
the
soldier
endeavour'd
to
intercept
its
return
;
but
drive
it
upon
the
Matrosses
,
one
of
them
,
who
be
jealous
of
its
get
back
into
the
Hands
of
the
Soldiers
,
draw
his
Pistol
to
shoot
it
,
which
be
the
source
of
this
miserable
Catastrophe
.
<EOS>
the
Lieutenant
carry'd
along
with
him
a
Bag
of
dollar
to
pay
the
Soldiers
'
Quarters
,
of
which
the
People
,
and
the
soldier
that
be
say'd
,
find
many
;
but
blow
to
an
inconceivable
distance
.
  
<EOS>
with
those
few
soldier
that
remain'd
<EOS>
alive
,
I
proceed
,
accord
to
my
order
,
to
Requina
;
where
,
when
I
arriv'd
,
I
give
General
Windham
an
Account
of
the
Disaster
at
St.
Jago
.
<EOS>
as
such
it
trouble
him
,
and
not
a
little
on
account
of
the
Disappointment
.
<EOS>
however
,
to
make
the
good
of
a
bad
market
,
he
give
order
for
the
forming
of
a
mine
under
an
old
Castle
,
which
be
part
of
the
Wall
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
order'd
,
so
it
be
begin
,
more
in
Terrorem
,
than
with
any
Expectation
of
Success
from
it
as
a
Mine
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
have
scarce
begin
to
frame
the
Oven
of
the
Mine
,
when
those
within
the
Town
desir'd
to
capitulate
.
<EOS>
this
be
all
we
could
aim
at
,
under
the
Miscarriage
of
our
Powder
at
St.
Jago
(
none
be
yet
arriv'd
to
supply
that
Defect
)
<EOS>
article
be
readily
grant
them
;
pursuant
to
which
,
that
part
of
the
Garrison
,
which
be
compos'd
of
Castilian
Gentry
,
have
liberty
to
go
wherever
they
think
best
,
and
the
rest
be
make
Prisoners
of
War
.
<EOS>
Requina
be
thus
reduc'd
<EOS>
to
the
Obedience
of
Charles
III
<EOS>
a
new
rais'd
Regiment
of
Spaniards
be
leave
in
Garrison
,
the
Colonel
of
which
be
appoint
Governor
;
and
our
Supply
of
Powder
have
at
last
get
safe
to
us
,
General
Windham
march'd
his
little
Army
to
Cuenca
.
  
<EOS>
CUENCA
be
a
considerable
city
and
a
bishoprick
;
therefore
to
pretend
to
sit
down
before
it
with
such
a
Company
of
Forragers
,
rather
than
an
Army
,
must
be
plac'd
among
the
hardy
Influences
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
's
auspicious
administration
.
<EOS>
on
the
out
part
of
Cuenca
there
stand
an
old
Castle
,
from
which
,
upon
our
Approach
,
they
play'd
upon
us
furiously
:
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
we
could
bring
two
piece
of
our
Cannon
to
bear
,
we
answer
their
fire
with
so
good
Success
,
that
we
soon
oblig'd
them
to
retire
into
the
Town
.
<EOS>
We
have
rais'd
<EOS>
a
Battery
of
twelve
Guns
against
the
City
,
on
their
rejection
of
the
Summons
send
them
to
come
under
the
Obedience
of
King
Charles
;
go
to
which
from
the
old
Castle
last
reduc'd
,
<EOS>
I
receiv'd
<EOS>
a
shot
on
the
Toe
of
one
of
my
shoe
,
which
carry'd
<EOS>
that
part
of
the
Shoe
intirely
away
,
without
any
further
damage
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
that
Battery
we
ply'd
them
warmly
(
as
well
as
from
three
Mortars
)
for
the
Space
of
three
day
,
their
night
include
;
but
observe
,
that
in
one
particular
House
,
they
be
remarkably
busy
;
<EOS>
People
throng
in
and
out
below
;
and
those
above
fire
perpetually
out
of
the
Windows
,
I
be
resolv'd
to
have
one
shot
at
that
window
,
and
make
those
officer
about
me
take
Notice
of
it
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
the
Distance
would
hardly
allow
me
to
hope
for
Success
;
yet
as
the
Experiment
could
only
be
attend
with
the
expence
of
a
single
Ball
,
I
make
it
.
<EOS>
so
soon
as
the
Smoak
of
my
own
Cannon
would
permit
it
,
we
could
see
Clouds
of
Dust
issue
from
out
of
the
Window
,
which
,
together
with
the
People
's
croude
out
of
door
,
<EOS>
convinc'd
<EOS>
the
officer
,
whom
I
have
desir'd
to
take
Notice
of
it
,
that
I
have
be
no
bad
Marksman
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
,
two
priest
be
send
out
of
the
place
with
proposal
;
but
they
be
so
triflingly
extravagant
,
that
as
soon
as
ever
the
General
hear
them
,
he
order'd
<EOS>
their
answer
in
a
fresh
renewal
of
the
Fire
of
both
Cannon
and
Mortars
.
<EOS>
and
it
happen'd
to
be
with
so
much
Havock
and
Execution
,
that
they
be
soon
teach
reason
;
and
send
back
their
Divines
,
with
much
more
moderate
demand
.
<EOS>
after
the
General
have
a
little
modell'd
<EOS>
these
last
,
they
be
accept
;
and
accord
to
the
Articles
of
Capitulation
,
the
City
be
that
very
day
surrender'd
into
our
Possession
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Duncannon
's
Regiment
take
Guard
of
all
the
Gates
;
and
King
Charles
be
proclaim'd
in
due
Form
.
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
during
this
Expedition
,
have
leave
Valencia
,
and
be
arriv'd
at
my
Lord
Galway
's
camp
at
Guadalaxara
;
who
for
the
Confederates
,
and
King
Charles
in
particular
,
unfortunately
be
order'd
from
Portugal
,
to
take
the
Command
from
a
General
,
who
have
all
along
be
almost
miraculously
successful
,
and
by
his
own
great
action
pay'd
the
way
for
a
safe
passage
to
that
his
Supplanter
.
  
<EOS>
yet
even
in
this
fatal
Place
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
make
some
proposal
,
which
,
have
they
be
embrac'd
,
may
,
in
all
probability
,
have
secur'd
<EOS>
Madrid
from
fall
into
the
Hands
of
the
enemy
;
but
,
in
opposition
thereto
,
the
Lord
Galway
,
and
all
his
Portugueze
Officers
,
be
for
force
the
next
Day
the
Enemy
to
Battle
.
<EOS>
the
almost
only
person
against
it
be
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
;
who
then
<EOS>
and
there
take
the
liberty
to
evince
the
impossibility
of
come
to
an
Engagement
.
<EOS>
this
the
next
morning
too
evidently
make
apparent
,
when
upon
the
first
Motion
of
our
troop
towards
the
River
,
which
they
pretend
to
pass
,
and
must
pass
,
before
they
could
engage
,
they
be
so
warmly
salute
from
the
Batteries
of
the
Enemy
,
and
their
small
Shot
,
that
our
regiment
be
forc'd
to
retire
in
Confusion
to
their
camp
.
<EOS>
by
which
Rebuff
all
heroical
imagination
be
at
present
lay
aside
,
to
consider
how
they
may
make
their
retreat
to
Valencia
.
  
<EOS>
the
Retreat
be
at
last
resolv'd
on
,
and
a
Multiplicity
of
Generals
render
our
bad
circumstance
much
bad
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
meet
with
a
fortunate
Reprieve
,
by
solicitation
from
the
Queen
,
and
desire
tantamount
to
Orders
,
that
he
would
go
with
the
troop
leave
in
Catalonia
to
the
Relief
of
the
Duke
of
Savoy
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
to
be
doubt
that
that
General
be
glad
to
withdraw
from
those
Scenes
of
Confusion
,
which
be
but
too
visible
to
eye
even
less
discerning
than
his
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
forebore
to
prepare
himself
to
put
her
Majesty
's
desire
in
execution
,
as
they
be
not
peremptory
,
till
it
have
be
resolv'd
by
the
unanimous
Consent
of
a
Council
of
War
,
where
the
King
,
all
the
Generals
and
Ministers
be
present
.
<EOS>
that
it
be
expedient
for
the
Service
that
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
during
the
Winter
Season
,
should
comply
with
her
Majesty
's
desire
,
and
go
for
Italy
;
since
he
may
return
before
the
opening
of
the
Campaign
,
if
it
should
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
and
return
indeed
he
do
,
before
the
campaign
open'd
,
and
bring
along
with
him
one
hundred
thousand
pound
from
Genoa
,
to
the
great
Comfort
and
Support
of
our
troop
,
which
have
neither
Money
nor
Credit
.
<EOS>
but
on
his
Return
,
that
noble
Earl
find
the
Lord
Galway
have
be
near
as
successful
against
him
,
as
he
have
be
unsuccessful
against
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
Thence
be
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
recall'd
to
make
room
for
an
unfortunate
General
,
who
the
next
year
suffer'd
<EOS>
himself
to
be
decoy'd
into
that
fatal
Battle
of
Almanza
.
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
on
his
leave
Valencia
,
have
order'd
<EOS>
his
baggage
to
follow
him
to
the
Camp
at
Guadalaxara
;
and
it
arriv'd
<EOS>
in
our
little
Camp
,
so
far
safe
in
its
way
to
the
great
at
Guadalaxara
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
consist
of
seven
load
Waggons
;
and
General
Windham
give
Orders
for
a
small
Guard
to
escorte
it
;
under
which
they
proceed
on
their
Journey
:
but
about
eight
league
from
Cuenca
,
at
a
pretty
Town
call'd
Huette
,
a
Party
from
the
Duke
of
Berwick
's
Army
,
with
bough
in
their
hat
,
the
well
to
appear
what
they
be
not
(
for
the
Bough
in
the
hat
be
the
Badge
of
the
English
,
as
white
Paper
be
the
Badge
of
the
French
)
come
into
the
Town
,
cry
all
the
way
,
Viva
Carlos
Tercero
,
Viva
.
<EOS>
with
these
acclamation
in
their
mouth
,
they
advanc'd
up
to
the
very
Waggons
;
when
attack
the
Guards
,
who
have
too
much
delude
themselves
with
appearance
,
they
route
'em
,
and
immediately
plunder'd
the
Waggons
of
all
that
be
valuable
,
and
then
march'd
off
.
  
<EOS>
the
noise
of
this
soon
reach'd
<EOS>
the
ear
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
at
Guadalaxara
.
<EOS>
when
leave
my
Lord
Galways
Camp
,
pursuant
to
the
Resolutions
of
the
Council
of
War
,
with
a
Party
only
of
fourscore
of
Killigrew
's
dragoon
,
he
meet
General
Windham
's
little
Army
within
a
League
of
Huette
,
the
place
where
his
baggage
have
be
plunder'd
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
have
strong
motive
of
Suspicion
,
that
the
inhabitant
have
give
Intelligence
to
the
enemy
;
and
,
as
be
very
natural
,
give
way
to
the
first
Dictates
of
Resentment
,
he
resolv'd
to
have
lay'd
the
Town
in
Ashes
:
<EOS>
but
when
he
come
near
it
,
the
Clergy
and
Magistrates
upon
their
knee
,
disavow
the
charge
,
and
assert
their
innocence
,
prevail'd
on
the
good
nature
of
that
generous
Earl
,
without
any
great
difficulty
,
to
spare
the
Town
,
at
least
not
to
burn
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
march'd
however
into
the
Town
,
and
that
Night
take
up
our
Quarters
there
;
and
the
Magistrates
,
under
the
Dread
of
our
avenge
our
self
,
on
their
part
take
care
that
we
be
well
supplied
.
<EOS>
but
when
they
be
make
sensible
of
the
Value
of
the
loss
,
which
the
Earl
have
sustain'd
;
and
that
on
a
moderate
Computation
it
amount
to
at
least
eight
thousand
Pistoles
;
they
voluntarily
present
themselves
next
morning
,
and
of
their
own
accord
offer'd
to
make
his
lordship
full
satisfaction
,
and
that
,
in
their
own
Phrase
,
de
Contado
,
in
Ready
Money
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
be
not
displeas'd
at
their
offer
;
but
generously
make
Answer
,
that
he
be
just
come
from
my
Lord
Galway
's
Camp
at
Chincon
,
where
he
find
they
be
in
a
likelihood
of
want
Bread
;
and
as
he
imagin'd
it
may
be
easy
to
them
to
raise
the
value
in
Corn
,
than
in
ready
money
;
if
they
would
send
to
that
value
in
corn
to
the
Lord
Galway
's
Camp
,
he
would
be
<EOS>
satisfy'd
.
<EOS>
this
they
with
Joy
embrac'd
,
and
immediately
comply
with
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
apt
to
think
the
last
century
<EOS>
(
and
I
very
much
fear
the
Current
will
be
as
deficient
)
can
hardly
produce
a
parallel
instance
of
Generosity
and
true
public
spiritedness
;
and
the
World
will
be
of
my
opinion
,
when
I
have
corroborate
this
with
another
Passage
some
year
after
.
<EOS>
the
Commissioners
for
state
the
Debts
due
to
the
Army
,
meet
daily
for
that
purpose
at
their
House
in
Darby
Court
in
Channel
Row
<EOS>
,
I
there
mention
to
Mr.
Read
,
Gentleman
to
his
lordship
,
this
very
just
and
honourable
claim
upon
the
Government
,
as
monie
advance
for
the
Use
of
the
Army
.
<EOS>
who
tell
me
in
a
little
time
after
,
that
he
have
mention'd
it
to
his
lordship
,
but
with
no
other
Effect
than
to
have
it
reject
with
a
generous
Disdain
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
stay
at
Huette
there
be
a
little
Incident
in
Life
,
which
give
me
great
Diversion
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
,
who
have
always
maintain'd
a
good
correspondence
with
the
fair
sex
,
<EOS>
hear
from
one
of
the
Priests
of
the
Place
,
that
on
the
Alarm
of
burn
the
Town
,
one
of
the
fine
Ladies
in
all
Spain
have
take
Refuge
in
the
Nunnery
,
be
desirous
to
speak
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
Nunnery
stand
upon
a
small
rise
Hill
within
the
Town
;
and
to
obtain
the
View
,
the
Earl
have
presently
in
his
Head
this
Stratagem
;
he
send
for
me
,
as
Engineer
,
to
have
my
advice
,
how
to
raise
a
proper
fortification
upon
that
Hill
out
of
the
Nunnery
.
<EOS>
I
wait
upon
his
lordship
to
the
Place
,
where
declare
the
intent
of
our
come
,
and
give
plausible
reason
for
it
,
the
train
take
,
and
immediately
the
Lady
Abbess
,
and
the
fair
Lady
,
come
out
to
make
Intercession
,
that
his
lordship
would
be
pleas'd
to
lay
aside
that
Design
.
<EOS>
the
divine
oratory
of
one
,
and
the
beautiful
Charms
of
the
other
,
prevail'd
;
so
his
lordship
leave
the
fortification
to
be
the
work
of
some
future
generation
.
  
<EOS>
from
Huette
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
<EOS>
march'd
forwards
for
Valencia
,
with
only
those
fourscore
dragoon
,
which
come
with
him
from
Chincon
,
leave
General
Windham
pursue
his
own
order
to
join
his
force
to
the
Army
then
under
the
Command
of
the
Lord
Galway
.
<EOS>
but
stop
at
Campilio
,
a
little
Town
in
our
way
,
his
lordship
have
information
of
a
most
barbarous
Fact
commit
that
very
morning
by
the
Spaniards
,
at
a
small
Villa
,
about
a
League
distant
,
upon
some
English
Soldiers
.
  
<EOS>
a
captain
of
the
English
Guards
(
whose
name
have
slip'd
<EOS>
my
Memory
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
well
know
the
Man
)
march
in
order
to
join
the
Battalion
of
the
Guards
,
then
under
the
Command
of
General
Windham
,
with
some
of
his
soldier
,
that
have
be
in
the
Hospital
,
take
up
his
Quarters
in
that
little
Villa
.
<EOS>
but
on
his
marching
out
of
it
,
next
Morning
,
a
Shot
in
the
back
lay
that
Officer
dead
upon
the
Spot
:
<EOS>
and
as
it
have
be
before
concert
,
the
Spaniards
of
the
place
at
the
same
time
fall
upon
the
poor
,
weak
Soldiers
,
kill
several
;
not
even
spare
their
wife
.
<EOS>
this
be
but
a
prelude
to
their
barbarity
;
their
savage
Cruelty
be
only
whet
,
not
glut
.
<EOS>
They
take
the
survive
few
;
hurried
and
dragg'd
them
up
a
Hill
,
a
little
without
the
Villa
.
<EOS>
on
the
top
of
this
Hill
there
be
a
Hole
,
or
opening
,
somewhat
like
the
Mouth
of
one
of
our
Coal
-
Pits
,
<EOS>
down
this
they
cast
several
,
who
,
with
hideous
Shrieks
and
Cries
,
make
more
hideous
by
the
ecchoe
of
the
Chasm
,
there
lose
their
life
.
  
<EOS>
this
relation
be
thus
make
to
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
at
his
Quarters
at
Campilio
;
who
immediately
give
Orders
for
to
sound
to
Horse
.
<EOS>
at
first
we
be
all
surpriz'd
;
but
be
soon
satisfy'd
,
that
it
be
to
revenge
,
or
rather
,
do
Justice
,
on
this
barbarous
action
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
enter'd
the
Villa
we
find
that
most
of
the
inhabitant
,
but
especially
the
most
guilty
,
have
withdraw
themselves
on
our
Approach
.
<EOS>
We
find
,
however
,
many
of
the
dead
soldier
cloath
,
which
have
be
convey'd
into
the
Church
,
and
there
hide
.
<EOS>
and
a
strong
accusation
be
lay
against
a
person
belong
to
the
Church
,
and
full
Proof
make
,
that
he
have
be
singularly
industrious
in
the
execution
of
that
horrid
Piece
of
Barbarity
on
the
Hill
,
his
lordship
command
him
to
be
hang'd
up
at
the
Knocker
of
the
Door
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
piece
of
military
Justice
,
we
be
lead
up
to
the
fatal
Pit
or
Hole
,
down
which
many
have
be
cast
headlong
.
<EOS>
there
we
find
one
poor
soldier
alive
,
who
,
upon
his
throwing
in
,
have
catch'd
fast
hold
of
some
impending
bush
,
and
sav'd
himself
on
a
little
Jutty
within
the
concavity
.
<EOS>
on
hear
us
talk
English
he
cry'd
out
;
and
Ropes
be
let
down
,
in
a
little
time
he
be
draw
up
;
when
he
give
us
an
ample
detail
of
the
whole
Villany
.
<EOS>
among
other
Particulars
,
I
remember
he
tell
me
of
a
very
narrow
Escape
he
have
in
that
obscure
Recess
.
<EOS>
a
poor
woman
,
one
of
the
wife
of
the
Soldiers
,
who
be
throw
down
after
him
,
struggle
,
and
roar
so
much
,
that
they
could
not
,
without
all
their
Force
,
throw
her
cleaverly
in
the
Middle
;
by
which
mean
fall
near
the
side
,
in
her
fall
she
almost
beat
him
from
his
Place
of
Security
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
conclusion
of
this
tragical
relation
of
the
Soldier
thus
save
,
his
lordship
give
immediate
Orders
for
the
firing
of
the
Villa
,
which
be
execute
with
due
severity
:
<EOS>
after
which
his
lordship
march'd
back
to
his
Quarters
at
Campilio
;
from
whence
,
two
day
after
,
we
arriv'd
at
Valencia
,
where
,
the
first
Thing
present
to
that
noble
Lord
,
be
all
the
Papers
take
in
the
Plunder
of
his
Baggage
,
which
the
Duke
of
Berwick
have
generously
order'd
to
be
return'd
him
,
without
waste
or
opening
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
too
manifest
,
after
the
Earl
's
arrival
at
this
City
,
that
the
Alteration
in
the
Command
of
the
English
Forces
,
which
before
be
only
receiv'd
as
a
Rumour
,
have
deep
ground
for
Belief
,
than
many
of
his
Friends
in
that
City
could
have
wish'd
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
have
gain'd
<EOS>
the
love
of
all
by
a
thousand
engage
Condescensions
;
even
his
Gallantries
be
no
way
prejudicial
,
be
not
offensive
;
and
though
his
lordship
do
his
utmost
to
conceal
his
Chagrin
,
the
Sympathy
of
those
around
him
make
such
discovery
upon
him
,
as
would
have
disappoint
a
double
portion
of
his
caution
.
<EOS>
They
have
see
him
un
-
elate
under
Successes
,
that
be
so
near
be
unaccountable
,
that
in
a
Country
of
less
Superstition
than
Spain
,
they
may
almost
have
pass'd
for
miraculous
;
they
know
full
well
,
that
nothing
,
but
that
Series
of
Successes
have
pav'd
a
passage
for
the
General
that
be
to
supersede
him
;
those
only
have
remove
all
the
difficulty
of
his
March
from
Portugal
to
Madrid
;
they
know
him
the
old
General
;
and
therefore
not
know
,
that
in
the
Court
he
come
from
,
Intrigue
be
too
often
the
Soul
of
Merit
,
they
could
not
but
be
amazed
at
a
Change
,
which
his
lordship
be
unwille
any
body
should
perceive
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
upon
this
Account
,
that
,
as
formerly
,
he
treat
the
Ladies
with
Balls
,
and
to
pursue
the
Dons
in
their
own
Humour
,
order'd
<EOS>
a
Tawridore
or
Bull
-
Feast
.
<EOS>
in
Spain
no
sort
of
public
diversion
be
esteem
equal
with
this
.
<EOS>
but
the
Bulls
provide
at
Valencia
,
not
be
of
the
right
Breed
,
nor
ever
initiate
in
the
Mysteries
,
do
not
acquit
themselves
at
all
masterly
;
and
consequently
,
do
not
give
the
diversion
,
or
satisfaction
expect
.
<EOS>
for
which
reason
I
shall
omit
give
a
description
of
this
Bull
-
Feast
;
and
desire
my
reader
to
suspend
his
Curiosity
till
I
come
to
some
,
which
,
in
the
Spanish
Sense
,
be
much
more
entertaining
;
that
is
,
attend
with
much
great
Hazards
and
Danger
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
I
have
say
,
the
Gallantries
of
the
General
be
mostly
political
at
least
very
inoffensive
;
yet
there
happen'd
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
and
in
this
Place
,
a
piece
of
Gallantry
,
that
give
the
Earl
a
vast
deal
of
Offence
and
Vexation
;
as
a
Matter
,
that
in
its
consequence
may
have
be
fatal
to
the
Interest
of
King
Charles
,
if
not
to
the
English
Nation
in
general
;
and
which
I
the
rather
relate
,
in
that
it
may
be
of
use
to
young
officer
,
and
other
;
point
out
to
them
the
Danger
,
not
to
say
Folly
,
of
inadvertent
and
precipitate
Engagements
,
under
unruly
passion
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
before
,
that
Valencia
be
famous
for
fine
woman
.
<EOS>
It
indeed
abound
in
them
;
and
among
those
,
be
great
number
of
Courtezans
not
inferior
in
Beauty
to
any
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
two
of
our
English
Officers
,
not
care
for
the
common
Road
,
however
safe
,
resolv'd
to
launch
into
the
deep
Seas
,
though
attend
with
much
great
Danger
.
<EOS>
Amours
,
the
common
Failing
of
that
fair
City
,
be
the
Occasion
of
this
Accident
,
and
two
nun
the
object
.
<EOS>
It
be
customary
in
that
Country
for
young
People
in
an
evening
to
resort
to
the
Grates
of
the
Nunneries
,
there
to
divert
themselves
,
and
the
Nuns
,
with
a
little
pleasant
and
inoffensive
chit
-
chat
.
<EOS>
for
though
I
have
hear
some
relate
a
world
of
nauseous
passage
at
such
conversation
,
I
must
declare
,
that
I
never
see
,
or
hear
any
Thing
unseemly
;
and
therefore
whenever
I
have
hear
any
such
from
such
Fabulists
,
I
never
so
much
wrong'd
<EOS>
my
Judgment
as
to
afford
them
Credit
.
  
<EOS>
Our
two
officer
be
very
assiduous
at
the
Grates
of
a
Nunnery
in
this
place
;
and
have
there
pitch'd
<EOS>
upon
two
Nuns
,
prosecute
their
Amours
with
such
vigour
,
that
,
in
a
little
time
,
they
have
make
a
very
great
progress
in
their
affection
,
without
in
the
least
consider
the
danger
that
must
attend
themselves
and
the
Fair
;
they
have
exchang'd
vow
,
and
prevail'd
upon
the
weak
vessel
to
endeavour
to
get
out
to
their
lover
.
<EOS>
to
effect
which
,
soon
after
,
a
Plot
be
lay'd
;
the
Means
,
the
Hour
,
and
every
thing
agree
upon
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
custom
of
that
Nunnery
,
as
of
many
other
,
for
the
Nuns
to
take
their
weekly
course
in
keep
the
key
of
all
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
two
Love
-
sick
Ladies
give
notice
to
their
lover
at
the
Grate
,
that
one
of
their
Turns
be
come
,
the
Night
and
Hour
be
appoint
,
which
the
officer
punctually
observe
,
carry'd
<EOS>
off
their
prey
without
either
Difficulty
or
Interruption
.
  
<EOS>
but
next
morning
,
when
the
Nuns
be
miss
,
what
an
Uproar
be
there
over
all
the
city
?
<EOS>
the
Ladies
be
both
of
quality
;
and
therefore
the
tiding
be
first
carry'd
to
their
Relations
.
<EOS>
They
receiv'd
the
News
with
vow
of
utmost
vengeance
;
and
,
as
be
usual
in
that
Country
,
put
themselves
in
arm
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
there
need
no
great
canvassing
for
discover
who
be
the
aggressor
:
the
officer
have
be
too
frequent
,
and
too
publick
,
in
their
address
,
to
leave
any
room
for
question
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
they
be
complain'd
of
and
seek
for
,
but
sensible
at
last
of
their
past
temerity
,
they
endeavour'd
,
and
with
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
perfect
their
escape
.
  
<EOS>
less
fortunate
be
the
two
fair
Nuns
;
their
lover
,
in
their
utmost
exigence
,
have
forsake
them
;
and
they
,
poor
Creatures
,
know
not
where
to
fly
.
<EOS>
under
this
sad
Dilemma
they
be
take
;
and
,
as
in
like
Offences
,
condemn'd
<EOS>
directly
to
the
punishment
of
immure
.
<EOS>
and
what
great
punishment
be
there
on
Earth
than
to
be
confin'd
between
four
narrow
wall
,
only
open
at
the
top
;
and
thence
to
be
half
support
with
Bread
and
Water
,
till
the
Offenders
gradually
starve
to
death
?
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
though
highly
exasperate
at
the
Proceedings
of
his
officer
,
in
compassion
to
the
unhappy
Fair
,
resolv'd
to
interpose
by
all
the
moderate
mean
possible
.
<EOS>
He
know
very
well
,
that
no
one
Thing
could
so
much
prejudice
<EOS>
the
Spaniard
against
him
,
as
the
countenancing
such
an
action
;
wherefore
he
inveigh'd
against
the
Officers
,
at
the
same
time
that
he
endeavour'd
to
mitigate
in
favour
of
the
Ladies
:
<EOS>
but
all
be
in
vain
;
it
be
urg'd
against
those
charitable
intercession
,
that
they
have
break
their
vow
;
and
in
that
have
break
in
upon
the
Laws
of
the
Nunnery
and
Religion
;
the
Consequence
of
all
which
could
be
nothing
less
than
the
Punishment
appoint
to
be
inflict
.
<EOS>
and
which
be
the
hard
of
all
,
the
near
of
their
Relations
most
<EOS>
oppos'd
<EOS>
all
his
generous
Mediations
;
and
those
,
who
accord
to
the
common
course
of
Nature
should
have
thank'd
<EOS>
him
for
his
Endeavours
to
be
instrumental
in
rescue
them
from
the
impend
Danger
,
grow
more
and
more
enrag'd
,
because
he
oppos'd
them
in
their
design
of
a
cruel
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
which
the
Earl
persever'd
;
and
after
a
deal
of
Labour
,
first
get
the
penalty
suspend
;
and
,
soon
after
,
by
the
Dint
of
a
very
considerable
Sum
of
Money
(
a
most
powerful
argument
,
which
prevail
in
every
country
)
sav'd
the
poor
Nuns
from
immure
;
and
at
last
,
though
with
great
Reluctance
,
he
get
them
receiv'd
<EOS>
again
into
the
Nunnery
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
Warlike
Lovers
,
one
of
them
be
the
year
after
slain
at
the
Battle
of
Almanza
;
the
other
be
yet
live
,
be
a
Brigadier
in
the
Army
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
be
here
with
his
little
Army
of
great
Hereticks
,
neither
priest
nor
People
be
so
open
in
their
superstitious
Fopperies
,
as
I
at
other
time
find
them
.
<EOS>
for
which
reason
I
will
make
bold
,
and
by
an
Antichronism
in
this
place
,
a
little
anticipate
some
observation
that
I
make
some
time
after
the
Earl
leave
it
.
<EOS>
and
as
I
have
not
often
commit
such
a
Transgression
,
I
hope
it
may
be
the
more
excusable
now
,
and
no
way
blemish
my
Memoirs
,
that
I
break
in
upon
the
Series
of
my
Journal
.
  
<EOS>
VALENCIA
be
a
handsome
City
,
and
a
bishoprick
;
and
be
considerable
not
only
for
the
Pleasantness
of
its
situation
and
beautiful
lady
;
but
(
which
at
some
certain
Times
,
and
on
some
occasion
,
to
them
be
more
valuable
than
both
those
put
together
)
for
be

place
of

next
for

Santo
Domingo
,
the

of

Dominican
Order

<EOS>

very
splendid
Convent
of

<EOS>
walk
by
which
,
I
one
Day
observ'd
over
the
Gate
,
a
figure
of
a
man
in
stone
;
and
near
it
a
Dog
with
a
light
torch
in
his
Mouth
.
<EOS>
the
image
I
rightly
enough
take
to
intend
that
of
the
Saint
;
but
inquire
of
one
of
the
order
,
at
the
Gate
,
the
meaning
of
the
figure
near
it
,
he
very
courteously
ask'd
me
to
walk
in
,
and
then
entertain'd
me
with
the
follow
relation
:
  
<EOS>
when
the
Mother
of
Santo
Domingo
,
say
that
Religious
,
be
with
Child
of
that
future
Saint
,
she
have
a
dream
which
very
much
afflict
her
.
<EOS>
She
dream
that
she
hear
a
Dog
bark
in
her
Belly
;
and
inquire
(
at
what
Oracle
be
not
say
)
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
her
Dream
,
she
be
tell
,
that
that
Child
should
bark
out
the
Gospel
(
excuse
the
Bareness
of
the
expression
,
it
may
run
better
in
Spanish
;
tho
'
,
if
I
remember
right
,
Erasmus
give
it
in
Latin
much
the
same
turn
)
which
should
thence
shine
out
like
that
light
Torch
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
Reason
,
that
wherever
you
see
the
image
of
that
Saint
,
a
Dog
and
a
light
torch
be
in
the
Group
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
at
the
same
time
,
that
there
have
be
more
Popes
and
Cardinals
of
that
order
than
of
any
,
if
not
all
the
other
.
<EOS>
to
confirm
which
,
he
lead
me
into
a
large
Gallery
,
on
each
side
whereof
he
shew'd
me
<EOS>
the
Pictures
of
all
the
Popes
and
Cardinals
that
have
be
of
that
order
;
among
which
,
I
particularly
take
Notice
of
that
of
Cardinal
Howard
,
great
Uncle
to
the
present
Duke
of
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
but
after
many
encomium
of
their
Society
,
with
which
he
interspers'd
his
discourse
,
he
add
one
that
I
least
valu'd
<EOS>
it
for
<EOS>
;
that
the
sole
care
and
Conduct
of
the
inquisition
be
intrust
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
find
me
attentive
,
or
not
so
contradictory
as
the
English
Humour
generally
be
,
he
next
bring
me
into
a
fair
and
large
Cloister
,
round
which
I
take
several
Turns
with
him
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
Place
be
too
delicious
to
tire
,
under
a
conversation
less
pertinent
or
courteous
than
that
<EOS>
he
entertain'd
me
with
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
Cloister
be
a
small
but
pretty
and
sweet
Grove
of
Orange
and
Lemon
-
tree
;
these
bear
Fruit
ripe
and
green
,
and
flower
,
all
together
on
one
tree
;
and
their
Fruit
be
so
very
large
and
beautiful
,
and
their
flower
so
transcendently
odoriferous
,
that
all
I
have
ever
see
of
the
like
Kind
in
England
could
comparatively
pass
only
for
Beauty
in
Epitome
,
or
Nature
imitate
in
Wax
-
work
.
<EOS>
many
Flocks
also
of
pretty
little
Birds
,
with
their
chearful
Notes
,
add
not
a
little
to
my
Delight
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
in
life
I
never
know
or
find
three
of
my
sense
at
once
so
exquisitely
gratify'd
.
  
<EOS>
not
far
from
this
,
Saint
Vincent
,
the
Patron
,
as
I
say
before
,
of
this
City
,
have
a
Chapel
dedicate
to
him
.
<EOS>
once
a
year
they
do
him
Honour
in
a
sumptuous
Procession
.
<EOS>
then
be
their
street
all
strow'd
with
flower
,
and
their
Houses
set
off
with
their
rich
tapestry
,
every
one
strive
to
excel
his
Neighbour
in
distinguish
himself
by
the
Honour
he
pay
to
that
Saint
;
and
he
be
the
good
Catholick
,
as
well
as
the
good
Citizen
,
in
the
Eye
of
the
religious
,
who
most
exert
himself
on
this
Occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
Procession
begin
with
a
Cavalcade
of
all
the
friar
of
all
the
convent
in
and
about
the
City
.
<EOS>
these
walk
two
and
two
with
fold
arm
,
and
eye
cast
down
to
the
very
ground
,
and
with
the
great
outward
appearance
of
Humility
imaginable
;
nor
,
though
the
Temptation
from
the
fine
woman
that
fill'd
their
window
,
or
the
rich
Tapestries
that
adorn'd
the
Balconies
may
be
allow'd
sufficient
to
attract
<EOS>
,
could
I
observe
that
any
one
of
them
all
ever
mov'd
them
upwards
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
Friars
be
bear
,
upon
the
Shoulders
of
twenty
Men
at
least
,
an
Imagine
of
that
Saint
of
solid
silver
,
large
as
the
life
;
It
be
plac'd
in
a
great
Chair
of
Silver
likewise
;
the
stave
that
bear
him
up
,
and
upon
which
they
bear
him
,
be
of
the
same
Metal
.
<EOS>
the
whole
be
a
most
costly
and
curious
Piece
of
Workmanship
,
such
as
my
eye
never
before
or
since
beheld
.
  
<EOS>
the
Magistrates
follow
the
image
and
its
supporter
,
dress'd
<EOS>
in
their
rich
apparel
,
which
be
always
on
this
day
,
and
on
this
Occasion
,
particularly
sumptuous
and
distinguishing
.
<EOS>
thus
be
the
image
,
in
the
great
Splendor
,
borne
and
accompany'd
round
that
fine
City
;
and
at
last
convey'd
to
the
place
from
whence
it
come
:
and
so
conclude
that
annual
Ceremony
.
  
<EOS>
the
Valencians
,
as
to
the
Exteriors
of
Religion
,
be
the
most
devout
of
any
in
Spain
,
though
in
common
Life
you
find
them
amorous
,
gallant
,
and
gay
,
like
other
People
;
yet
on
solemn
occasion
there
shine
out
-
<EOS>
right
such
a
Spirit
as
prove
them
the
very
Bigots
of
Bigotry
:
<EOS>
as
a
Proof
of
which
<EOS>
Assertion
,
I
will
now
give
some
Account
of
such
observation
,
as
I
have
time
to
make
upon
them
,
during
two
Lent
Seasons
,
while
I
reside
there
.
  
<EOS>
the
Week
before
the
Lent
commence
,
commonly
know
by
the
Name
of
Carnaval
Time
,
the
whole
city
appear
a
perfect
Bartholomew
Fair
;
the
street
be
croude
,
and
the
house
empty
;
nor
be
it
possible
to
pass
along
without
some
Gambol
or
Jack
-
pudde
Trick
offer'd
<EOS>
to
you
;
Ink
,
Water
,
and
sometimes
Ordure
,
be
sure
to
be
hurl'd
at
your
face
or
cloath
;
and
if
you
appear
concern'd
or
angry
,
they
rejoyce
at
it
,
pleas'd
<EOS>
the
more
,
the
more
they
displease
;
for
all
other
Resentment
be
at
that
time
out
of
Season
,
though
at
other
time
few
in
the
World
be
full
of
Resentment
or
more
captious
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
Gentry
,
or
Dons
,
to
express
their
Gallantry
,
carry
about
them
egg
-
shell
,
fill'd
with
Orange
or
other
sweet
Water
,
which
they
cast
at
lady
in
their
coach
,
or
such
other
of
the
fair
sex
as
they
happen
to
meet
in
the
Streets
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
all
,
if
you
would
think
them
extravagant
to
Day
,
as
much
transgress
the
Rules
of
common
Civility
,
and
neither
regard
Decency
to
one
another
,
nor
the
Duty
they
owe
to
Almighty
God
;
yet
when
Ash
-
Wednesday
come
you
will
imagine
them
more
unaccountable
in
their
conduct
,
be
then
as
much
too
excessive
in
all
outward
Indications
of
Humility
and
Repentance
.
<EOS>
here
you
shall
meet
one
,
bare
-
foot
,
with
a
Cross
on
his
Shoulder
,
a
Burden
rather
fit
for
somewhat
with
four
foot
,
and
which
<EOS>
his
poor
two
be
ready
to
sink
under
,
yet
the
vain
wretch
bear
and
sweat
,
and
sweat
and
bear
,
in
hope
of
find
Merit
in
an
Ass
's
labour
.
  
<EOS>
other
you
shall
see
naked
to
their
Wastes
,
whip
themselves
with
scourge
make
for
the
purpose
,
till
the
blood
follow
every
stroke
;
and
no
man
nee
be
at
a
loss
to
follow
them
by
the
very
Tracks
of
Gore
they
shed
in
this
frentick
Perambulation
.
<EOS>
some
,
who
from
the
thickness
of
their
hide
,
or
other
impediment
,
have
not
power
by
their
scourging
to
fetch
blood
of
themselves
,
be
follow'd
by
surgeon
with
their
lancet
,
who
at
every
turn
,
make
use
of
them
,
to
evince
the
Extent
of
their
Patience
and
Zeal
by
the
Smart
of
their
Folly
.
<EOS>
while
other
,
mingle
Amour
with
Devotion
,
take
particular
care
to
present
themselves
all
macerate
before
the
window
of
their
mistress
;
and
even
in
that
Condition
,
not
satisfy'd
with
what
they
have
barbarously
do
to
themselves
,
they
have
their
operator
at
hand
,
to
evince
their
love
by
the
Number
of
their
Gashes
and
Wounds
;
imagine
the
more
blood
they
lose
,
the
more
love
they
shew
,
and
the
more
they
shall
gain
.
<EOS>
these
be
generally
Devoto
's
of
quality
;
though
the
Tenet
be
universal
,
that
he
that
be
most
bloody
be
most
devout
.
  
<EOS>
after
these
Street
-
Exercises
,
these
ostentatious
castigation
be
over
,
these
self
-
sacrificer
repair
to
the
great
Church
,
the
bloodier
the
well
;
there
they
throw
themselves
,
in
a
Condition
too
vile
for
the
Eye
of
a
Female
,
before
the
image
of
the
Virgin
Mary
;
though
I
defy
all
their
race
of
father
,
and
their
infallible
holy
Father
into
the
Bargain
,
to
produce
any
Authority
to
fit
it
for
Belief
,
that
she
ever
delight
in
such
sanguinary
holocaust
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
whole
time
of
Lent
,
you
will
see
in
every
Street
some
Priest
or
Frier
,
upon
some
Stall
or
Stool
,
preach
up
Repentance
to
the
People
;
and
with
violent
blow
on
his
breast
cry
aloud
,
Mia
Culpa
,
mia
maxima
Culpa
,
till
he
extract
reciprocal
return
from
the
Hands
of
his
auditor
on
their
own
breast
.
  
<EOS>
when
Good
Friday
be
come
they
entertain
it
with
the
most
profound
Show
of
Reverence
and
Religion
,
both
in
their
street
and
in
their
church
.
<EOS>
in
the
last
,
particularly
,
they
have
contriv'd
<EOS>
about
twelve
a
-
Clock
suddenly
to
darken
them
,
so
as
to
render
them
quite
gloomy
.
<EOS>
this
they
do
to
intimate
the
Eclipse
of
the
Sun
,
<EOS>
which
at
that
time
happen'd
.
<EOS>
and
to
signify
the
rending
of
the
Vail
of
the
Temple
,
you
be
strike
with
a
strange
artificial
noise
at
the
very
same
instant
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
Easter
Day
appear
,
you
find
it
in
all
respect
with
them
a
day
of
rejoice
;
for
though
abstinence
from
Flesh
with
them
,
who
at
no
time
eat
much
,
be
not
so
great
a
mortification
as
with
those
of
the
same
Persuasion
in
other
country
,
who
eat
much
more
,
yet
there
be
a
visible
satisfaction
dart
out
at
their
eye
,
which
demonstrate
their
inward
pleasure
in
be
set
free
from
the
Confinement
of
Mind
to
the
Dissatisfaction
of
the
Body
.
<EOS>
every
person
you
now
meet
greet
you
with
a
Resurrexit
Jesus
;
a
good
Imitation
of
the
primitive
Christians
,
be
it
the
real
effect
of
Devotion
.
<EOS>
and
all
Sorts
of
the
good
Musick
(
which
here
indeed
be
the
good
in
all
Spain
)
proclaim
an
auspicious
Valediction
to
the
depart
season
of
superficial
sorrow
and
stupid
superstition
.
<EOS>
but
enough
of
this
:
I
proceed
to
weighty
matter
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
lay
at
Valencia
,
under
the
Vigilance
and
Care
of
the
indefatigable
Earl
,
News
be
bring
that
Alicant
be
besieg'd
by
General
Gorge
by
Land
,
while
a
Squadron
of
Men
of
War
batter'd
it
from
the
Sea
;
from
both
which
<EOS>
the
Besiegers
play'd
<EOS>
their
part
so
well
,
and
so
warmly
ply'd
them
with
their
Cannon
,
that
an
indifferent
practicable
Breach
be
make
in
a
little
time
.
  
<EOS>
Mahoni
command
in
the
Place
,
be
again
receiv'd
<EOS>
into
favour
;
and
clear'd
as
he
be
of
those
political
insinuation
before
intimate
,
he
now
seem'd
resolv'd
to
confirm
his
innocence
by
a
resolute
defence
.
<EOS>
however
,
perceive
that
all
preparation
tend
towards
a
storm
,
and
know
full
well
the
Weakness
of
the
Town
,
he
withdraw
his
Garrison
into
the
Castle
,
leave
the
Town
to
the
Defence
of
its
own
inhabitant
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
that
be
do
,
the
sailor
,
not
much
skill'd
in
Sieges
,
nor
at
all
time
capable
of
the
cool
consideration
,
with
a
Resolution
natural
to
them
,
storm'd
<EOS>
the
wall
to
the
side
of
the
Sea
;
where
not
meet
with
much
opposition
(
for
the
People
of
the
Town
apprehend
the
least
Danger
there
)
<EOS>
they
soon
get
into
the
place
;
and
,
as
soon
as
get
in
,
begin
to
plunder
.
<EOS>
this
oblig'd
<EOS>
the
People
,
for
the
well
security
of
themselves
,
to
open
their
gate
,
and
seek
a
Refuge
under
one
enemy
,
in
opposition
to
the
rage
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
General
Gorge
,
as
soon
as
he
enter'd
<EOS>
the
Town
,
with
a
good
deal
of
seem
Lenity
,
put
a
stop
to
the
Ravages
of
the
Sailors
;
and
order
Proclamation
to
be
make
throughout
the
Place
,
that
all
the
inhabitant
should
immediately
bring
in
their
good
effect
into
the
great
Church
for
their
well
Security
.
<EOS>
this
be
by
the
mistaken
Populace
,
as
readily
comply'd
with
;
and
neither
friend
nor
Foe
at
all
dispute
the
Command
,
or
question
the
integrity
of
the
Intention
;
the
Church
be
presently
croude
with
rich
of
all
sort
and
size
.
<EOS>
yet
after
some
time
remain
there
,
they
be
all
take
out
,
and
dispose
of
by
those
,
that
have
as
little
Property
in
'em
,
as
the
Sailors
,
they
be
pretend
to
be
preserv'd
from
.
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
upon
the
very
first
News
of
the
Siege
have
leave
Valencia
,
and
take
Shipping
for
Alicant
;
where
he
arrive
soon
after
the
surrender
of
the
Town
,
and
that
Outcry
of
the
good
of
the
Townsmen
.
<EOS>
upon
his
Arrival
,
Mahoni
,
who
be
block'd
up
in
the
Castle
,
and
have
experience
his
indefatigable
Diligence
,
be
in
want
of
provision
,
and
without
much
hope
of
Relief
,
desire
to
capitulate
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
grant
him
honourable
condition
,
upon
which
he
deliver
up
the
Castle
,
and
Gorge
be
make
Governor
.
  
<EOS>
upon
his
lordship
's
take
ship
at
Valencia
,
I
have
an
opportunity
of
march
with
those
dragoon
,
which
escort
him
from
Castile
,
who
have
receive
Orders
to
march
into
Murcia
.
<EOS>
We
quarter'd
<EOS>
the
first
Night
at
Alcira
,
a
Town
that
the
River
Segra
almost
surround
,
which
render
it
capable
of
be
make
a
place
of
vast
Strength
,
though
now
of
small
importance
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
Night
we
lie
at
Xativa
,
a
Place
famous
for
its
steadiness
to
King
Charles
.
<EOS>
General
Basset
,
a
Spaniard
,
be
Governor
<EOS>
;
it
be
besieg'd
by
the
Forces
of
King
Philip
;
but
after
a
noble
Resistance
,
the
Enemy
be
beat
off
,
and
the
Siege
raise
;
for
which
Effort
,
it
be
suppose
,
that
on
the
Retirement
of
King
Charles
out
of
this
country
,
it
be
depriv'd
of
its
old
Name
Xativa
,
and
be
now
call
San
Felippo
;
though
to
this
day
the
People
thereabout
much
dissallow
by
their
Practice
,
that
novel
denomination
.
  
<EOS>
We
march'd
<EOS>
next
morning
by
Monteza
;
which
give
name
to
the
famous
Title
of
Knights
of
Monteza
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
the
Time
that
Colonel
O
Guaza
,
an
irish
-
man
,
be
Governor
,
besieg'd
by
the
People
of
the
Country
,
in
favour
of
King
Charles
;
but
very
ineffectually
,
so
it
never
chang'd
its
Sovereign
.
<EOS>
that
night
we
quarter'd
<EOS>
at
Fonte
dalas
Figuras
,
within
one
League
of
Almanza
;
where
that
fatal
and
unfortunate
Battle
,
which
I
shall
give
an
Account
of
in
its
Place
,
be
fight
the
Year
after
,
under
the
Lord
Galway
.
  
<EOS>
on
our
fourth
day
March
we
be
oblig'd
to
pass
Villena
,
where
the
Enemy
have
a
Garrison
.
<EOS>
a
Party
of
Mahoni
's
dragoon
make
a
part
of
that
Garrison
,
and
they
be
command
by
Major
O.
Rairk
an
Irish
Officer
,
who
always
carry
the
reputation
of
a
good
soldier
,
and
a
brave
Gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
all
along
make
it
my
observation
,
that
Captain
Matthews
,
who
command
those
dragoon
,
that
I
<EOS>
march'd
with
,
be
a
person
of
much
more
courage
than
conduct
;
and
he
us'd
as
little
Precaution
here
,
though
just
march
under
the
Eye
of
the
Enemy
,
as
he
have
do
at
other
Times
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
become
intimately
acquainted
with
him
,
I
ride
up
to
him
,
and
tell
him
the
Danger
,
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
attend
our
present
March
.
<EOS>
I
point
out
to
him
just
before
Villena
a
jut
Hill
,
under
which
we
must
unavoidably
pass
;
at
the
turning
whereof
,
I
be
apprehensive
<EOS>
the
Enemy
may
he
,
and
either
by
Ambuscade
or
otherwise
,
surprize
us
;
I
therefore
intreate
we
may
either
wait
the
coming
of
our
Rear
Guard
;
or
at
least
march
with
a
little
more
leisure
and
caution
.
<EOS>
but
he
take
little
notice
of
all
I
say
,
keep
on
his
round
March
;
see
which
<EOS>
,
I
press'd
forward
my
Mule
,
which
be
a
very
good
one
,
and
rid
as
fast
as
her
Legs
could
carry
her
,
till
I
have
get
on
the
top
of
the
Hill
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
there
,
I
find
both
my
expectation
,
and
my
apprehension
answer
:
for
I
could
very
plainly
discern
three
Squadrons
of
the
Enemy
<EOS>
ready
draw
up
,
and
wait
for
Us
at
the
very
winding
of
the
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
I
hasten
back
to
the
Captain
with
the
like
speed
,
and
tell
him
the
Discovery
I
have
make
;
who
nevertheless
keep
on
his
March
,
and
it
be
with
a
good
deal
of
Difficulty
,
that
I
at
last
prevail'd
on
him
to
halt
,
till
our
Rear
Guard
of
twenty
Men
have
get
up
to
us
.
<EOS>
but
those
join
us
,
and
a
new
Troop
of
Spanish
Dragoons
,
who
have
march'd
towards
us
that
morning
,
appear
in
Sight
;
our
Captain
,
as
if
he
be
afraid
of
their
rival
him
in
his
Glory
,
at
the
very
turn
of
the
Hill
,
ride
in
a
full
Gallop
,
with
Sword
in
Hand
,
up
to
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
They
stand
their
ground
,
till
we
be
advanc'd
<EOS>
within
two
hundred
Yards
of
them
,
and
then
in
Confusion
endeavour
to
retire
into
the
Town
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
oblige
to
pass
over
a
small
Bridge
,
too
small
to
admit
of
such
a
company
in
so
much
haste
;
their
crouding
upon
which
obstruct
their
retreat
,
and
leave
all
that
could
not
get
over
,
to
the
Mercy
of
our
sword
,
which
spar'd
none
.
<EOS>
however
narrow
as
the
Bridge
be
,
Captain
Matthews
be
resolve
to
venture
over
after
the
Enemy
;
on
do
which
,
the
Enemy
make
a
halt
,
till
the
People
of
the
Town
,
and
the
very
Priests
come
out
to
their
relief
with
fire
arm
.
<EOS>
on
so
large
an
appearance
,
Captain
Matthews
think
it
not
adviseable
to
make
any
further
advance
;
so
drive
a
very
great
flock
of
sheep
from
under
the
Walls
,
he
continue
his
March
towards
Elda
.
<EOS>
in
this
action
we
lose
Captain
Topham
,
and
three
dragoon
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
we
be
not
march
very
far
from
the
Place
,
where
this
Rencounter
happen'd
;
when
an
irish
Dragoon
overtook
the
Captain
,
with
a
civil
message
from
Major
O
Rairk
,
desire
that
he
would
not
entertain
a
mean
opinion
of
him
for
the
Defence
that
be
make
;
since
could
he
have
get
the
Spaniards
to
have
stand
their
ground
,
he
should
have
give
him
good
reason
for
a
well
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
return'd
a
complimental
answer
,
and
so
march'd
on
.
<EOS>
this
major
o
Rairk
,
or
o
Roork
,
be
the
next
year
kill
at
alkay
,
be
much
lament
,
for
he
be
esteem
both
for
his
Courage
and
Conduct
,
one
of
the
good
of
the
irish
Officers
in
the
Spanish
Service
.
<EOS>
I
be
likewise
inform
that
he
be
descend
from
one
of
the
ancient
king
of
Ireland
;
the
Mother
of
the
honourable
Colonel
Paget
,
one
of
the
groom
of
the
Bedchamber
to
his
present
Majesty
,
be
nearly
relate
to
this
Gallant
Gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
one
remarkable
thing
I
see
in
that
Action
,
which
affect
and
surprise
me
;
a
Scotch
Dragoon
,
of
but
a
moderate
size
,
with
his
large
basket
-
hilted
Sword
,
strike
off
a
Spaniard
's
Head
at
one
stroke
,
with
the
same
ease
,
in
appearance
,
as
a
man
would
do
that
of
a
Poppy
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
Elda
(
a
Town
much
in
the
Interest
of
King
Charles
,
and
famous
for
its
fine
situation
,
and
the
large
grape
in
Spain
)
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
receive
us
in
a
manner
as
handsome
as
it
be
peculiar
;
all
stand
at
their
door
with
light
torch
;
which
consider
the
Time
we
enter'd
be
far
from
an
unwelcome
or
disagreeable
sight
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
Day
several
request
to
be
the
Messengers
of
the
action
at
Villena
to
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
at
Alicant
;
but
the
captain
return'd
<EOS>
this
answer
to
all
,
that
in
consideration
of
the
share
that
I
may
justly
claim
in
that
Day
's
transaction
,
he
could
not
think
of
let
any
other
person
be
the
Bearer
.
<EOS>
so
give
me
his
letter
to
the
Earl
,
I
the
next
day
deliver'd
<EOS>
them
to
him
at
Alicant
.
<EOS>
at
the
Delivery
,
Colonel
Killigrew
(
whose
dragoon
they
be
)
be
present
,
he
express
a
deal
of
satisfaction
at
the
Account
,
and
his
lordship
be
pleased
at
the
same
time
to
appoint
me
sole
Engineer
of
the
Castle
of
Alicant
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
which
,
that
successful
General
embark'd
<EOS>
for
Genoa
,
accord
to
the
Resolutions
of
the
Council
of
War
at
Guadalaxara
,
on
a
particular
Commission
from
the
Queen
of
England
,
another
from
Charles
King
of
Spain
,
and
charge
at
the
same
time
with
a
request
of
the
Marquiss
das
Minas
,
General
of
the
Portugueze
Forces
,
to
negotiate
bill
for
one
hundred
thousand
pound
for
the
use
of
his
troop
.
<EOS>
in
all
which
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
be
(
as
ever
)
successful
;
yet
may
it
be
say
without
a
figure
,
that
his
departure
,
in
a
good
measure
,
determin'd
<EOS>
the
Success
of
the
confederate
force
in
that
Kingdom
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
the
General
return'd
<EOS>
again
with
the
fortunate
,
fruit
of
those
negotiation
;
but
never
to
act
in
his
old
auspicious
Sphere
:
and
therefore
,
as
I
be
now
to
take
leave
of
this
fortunate
General
,
let
me
do
it
with
Justice
,
in
an
appeal
to
the
World
,
of
the
not
to
be
parallel'd
Usage
(
in
these
latter
Ages
,
at
least
)
that
he
meet
with
for
all
his
Services
;
such
a
vast
variety
of
enterprize
,
all
successful
,
and
which
have
set
all
Europe
in
amaze
;
service
that
have
give
occasion
to
such
solemn
and
public
thanksgiving
in
our
church
,
and
which
have
receive
such
very
remarkable
approbation
,
both
of
Sovereign
and
Parliament
;
and
which
have
be
represent
in
so
lively
a
Manner
,
in
a
letter
write
by
the
King
of
Spain
,
under
his
own
Hand
,
to
the
Queen
of
England
,
and
communicate
to
both
Houses
in
the
term
follow
:
  
Madam
,
my
Sister
,
  
I
should
not
have
be
so
long
<EOS>
e'er
<EOS>
I
do
my
self
<EOS>
the
Honour
to
repeat
the
assurance
of
my
sincere
respect
to
you
,
have
I
not
wait
for
the
good
Occasion
which
I
now
acquaint
you
with
,
that
the
City
of
Barcelona
be
surrender
to
me
by
Capitulation
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
you
will
receive
this
great
News
with
intire
Satisfaction
,
as
well
,
because
this
happy
Success
be
the
effect
of
your
arm
,
always
glorious
,
as
from
the
pure
motive
of
that
Bounty
and
maternal
affection
<EOS>
you
have
for
me
,
and
for
every
thing
which
may
contribute
to
the
Advancement
of
my
interest
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
do
this
justice
to
all
the
officer
and
common
soldier
,
and
particularly
to
my
Lord
Peterborow
,
that
he
have
show
in
this
whole
Expedition
,
a
Constancy
,
Bravery
,
and
Conduct
,
worthy
of
the
Choice
that
your
Majesty
have
make
of
him
,
and
that
he
could
no
way
give
me
well
satisfaction
than
he
have
,
by
the
great
Zeal
and
Application
,
which
he
have
equally
testify
for
my
interest
,
and
for
the
Service
of
my
person
.
<EOS>
I
owe
the
same
justice
to
Brigadier
Stanhope
,
for
his
great
Zeal
,
Vigilance
,
and
very
wise
Conduct
,
which
he
have
give
Proofs
of
upon
all
occasion
:
<EOS>
as
also
to
all
your
officer
of
the
Fleet
,
particularly
to
your
worthy
Admiral
Shovel
,
assure
your
Majesty
,
that
he
have
assist
me
in
this
Expedition
,
with
an
inconceivable
Readiness
and
Application
,
and
that
no
Admiral
will
be
ever
better
able
to
render
me
great
satisfaction
,
than
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
during
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
,
some
of
your
Majesty
's
Ships
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
troop
of
the
Country
,
have
reduc'd
<EOS>
the
Town
of
Tarragona
,
and
the
officer
be
make
Prisoners
of
War
.
<EOS>
the
Town
of
Girone
have
be
take
at
the
same
time
by
Surprize
,
by
the
troop
of
the
Country
.
<EOS>
the
Town
of
Lerida
have
submit
,
as
also
that
of
Tortosa
upon
the
Ebro
;
so
that
we
have
take
all
the
Places
of
Catalonia
,
except
rose
.
<EOS>
some
Places
in
Aragon
near
Sarrogosa
have
declare
for
me
,
and
the
Garrison
of
the
Castle
of
Denia
in
Valencia
have
maintain
their
post
,
and
repulse
the
Enemy
;
400
of
the
Enemies
Cavalry
have
enter'd
into
our
Service
,
and
a
great
number
of
their
Infantry
have
desert
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
Madam
,
be
the
state
that
your
arm
,
and
the
inclination
of
the
People
have
put
my
affair
in
.
<EOS>
It
be
unnecessary
to
tell
you
what
stop
the
course
of
these
conquest
,
it
be
not
the
season
of
the
Year
,
nor
the
enemy
;
these
be
no
obstacle
to
your
troop
,
who
desire
nothing
more
than
to
act
under
the
Conduct
that
your
Majesty
have
appoint
them
.
<EOS>
the
taking
of
Barcelona
,
with
so
small
a
Number
of
troop
,
be
very
remarkable
;
and
what
have
be
do
in
this
Siege
be
almost
without
example
;
that
with
seven
or
eight
thousand
man
of
your
troop
,
and
two
hundred
Miquelets
,
we
should
surround
and
invest
a
Place
,
that
thirty
thousand
French
could
not
block
up
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
March
of
thirteen
hour
,
the
troop
climb'd
up
the
Rocks
and
Precipices
,
to
attack
a
fortification
strong
than
the
Place
,
which
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
have
send
you
a
plan
of
;
two
general
,
with
the
Grenadiers
,
attack'd
<EOS>
it
Sword
in
Hand
.
<EOS>
in
which
action
the
Prince
of
Hesse
die
gloriously
,
after
so
many
brave
action
:
I
hope
his
Brother
and
his
Family
will
always
have
your
Majesty
's
Protection
.
<EOS>
with
eight
hundred
man
they
forc'd
the
cover'd
Way
,
and
all
the
Intrenchments
and
Works
,
one
after
another
,
till
they
come
to
the
last
work
which
surround
it
,
against
five
hundred
Men
of
regular
troop
which
defend
the
place
,
and
a
reinforcement
they
have
receiv'd
;
and
three
day
afterwards
we
become
Masters
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
We
afterwards
attack'd
<EOS>
the
Town
on
the
side
of
the
Castle
.
<EOS>
We
land
again
our
Cannon
,
and
the
other
Artillery
,
with
inconceivable
trouble
,
and
form'd
two
camp
,
distant
from
each
other
three
Leagues
,
against
a
Garrison
almost
as
numerous
as
our
Army
,
whose
Cavalry
be
double
the
Strength
of
our
.
<EOS>
the
first
Camp
be
so
well
intrench'd
,
<EOS>
that
'
twas
defend
by
two
thousand
Men
and
the
dragoon
;
whilst
we
attack'd
the
Town
with
the
rest
of
our
troop
.
<EOS>
the
Breach
be
make
,
we
prepar'd
to
make
a
general
Assault
with
all
the
Army
.
<EOS>
these
be
circumstance
,
Madam
,
which
distinguish
this
action
,
perhaps
,
from
all
other
.
  
<EOS>
here
have
happen'd
an
unforeseen
Accident
.
<EOS>
the
Cruelty
of
the
pretended
Viceroy
,
and
the
report
spread
abroad
,
that
he
would
take
away
the
Prisoners
,
contrary
to
the
Capitulation
,
provok'd
<EOS>
the
Burghers
,
and
some
of
the
Country
People
,
to
take
up
arm
against
the
Garrison
,
whilst
they
be
busy
in
pack
up
their
Baggage
,
which
be
to
be
send
away
the
next
day
;
so
that
every
thing
tend
to
Slaughter
:
but
your
Majesty
's
troop
,
enter
into
Town
with
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
instead
of
seek
pillage
,
a
Practice
common
upon
such
occasion
,
appeas'd
the
Tumult
,
and
have
say'd
the
Town
,
and
even
the
life
of
their
enemy
,
with
a
Discipline
and
Generosity
without
Example
.
  
<EOS>
what
remain
be
,
that
I
return
you
my
most
hearty
thank
for
send
so
great
<EOS>
a
Fleet
,
and
such
good
and
valiant
troop
to
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
after
so
happy
a
beginning
,
I
have
think
it
proper
,
accord
to
the
sentiment
of
your
Generals
and
Admirals
,
to
support
,
by
my
Presence
,
the
conquest
that
we
have
make
;
and
to
shew
my
subject
,
so
affectionate
to
my
person
,
that
I
can
not
abandon
them
.
<EOS>
I
receive
such
succour
from
your
Majesty
,
and
from
your
generous
nation
,
that
I
be
load
with
your
bounty
;
and
be
not
a
little
concern'd
to
think
that
the
support
of
my
interest
should
cause
so
great
an
expence
.
<EOS>
but
,
Madam
,
I
sacrifice
my
person
,
and
my
subject
in
Catalonia
expose
also
their
life
and
Fortunes
,
upon
the
assurance
they
have
of
your
Majesty
's
generous
Protection
.
<EOS>
Your
Majesty
and
your
Council
know
well
than
we
do
,
what
be
necessary
for
our
Conservation
.
<EOS>
We
shall
then
expect
your
Majesty
's
Succours
,
with
an
entire
confidence
in
your
Bounty
and
Wisdom
.
<EOS>
a
further
Force
be
necessary
:
We
give
no
small
diversion
to
France
,
and
without
doubt
they
will
make
their
utmost
effort
against
me
as
soon
as
possible
;
but
I
be
satisfy'd
,
that
the
same
effort
will
be
make
by
my
ally
to
defend
me
.
<EOS>
Your
Goodness
,
Madam
,
incline
you
,
and
your
power
enable
you
,
to
support
those
that
the
Tyranny
of
France
would
oppress
.
<EOS>
all
that
I
can
insinuate
to
your
wisdom
,
and
that
of
your
Allies
,
be
,
that
the
Forces
employ'd
<EOS>
in
this
Country
will
not
be
unprofitable
to
the
public
good
,
but
will
be
under
an
Obligation
and
necessity
to
act
with
the
utmost
vigour
against
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
  
with
an
inviolable
affection
,
respect
,
and
most
Sincere
Acknowledgment
,
Madam
,
my
Sister
,
Your
most
affectionate
brother
,
CHARLES
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
after
all
,
be
this
noble
General
<EOS>
not
only
recall'd
,
the
Command
of
the
Fleet
take
from
him
,
and
that
of
the
Army
give
to
my
Lord
Galway
,
without
Assignment
of
Cause
;
but
all
manner
of
Falsities
be
industriously
spread
abroad
,
not
only
to
dimish
,
if
they
could
,
his
reputation
,
but
to
bring
him
under
accusation
of
a
malevolent
nature
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
imagine
it
necessary
here
to
take
Notice
,
that
afterward
he
disprov'd
all
those
idle
Calumnies
and
ill
-
invent
Rumours
;
or
to
mention
what
Compliments
he
receiv'd
,
in
the
most
solemn
Manner
,
from
his
Country
,
upon
a
full
examination
and
thorough
canvassing
of
his
Actions
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
too
notorious
to
be
omit
,
that
all
officer
come
from
Spain
be
purposely
intercept
in
their
way
to
London
,
and
craftily
examin'd
upon
all
the
idle
story
which
have
pass'd
tend
to
lessen
his
Character
:
<EOS>
and
when
any
officer
have
assert
the
Falsity
of
those
Inventions
(
as
they
all
do
,
except
a
military
Sweetner
or
two
)
and
that
there
be
no
possibility
of
lay
any
thing
amiss
to
the
charge
of
that
General
 
<EOS>
they
be
tell
,
that
they
ought
to
be
careful
however
,
not
to
speak
advantagiously
of
that
Lord
's
Conduct
,
unless
they
be
willing
to
fall
Martyrs
in
his
cause
 
<EOS>
a
thing
scarce
to
be
credit
even
in
a
popish
country
.
<EOS>
but
Scipio
be
accus'd
 
tho
'
(
as
my
author
finely
observe
)
by
Wretches
only
know
to
Posterity
by
that
stupid
Accusation
.
  
<EOS>
as
a
mournful
valediction
,
before
I
enter
upon
any
new
Scene
,
the
Reader
will
pardon
this
melancholy
Expostulation
.
<EOS>
how
mortifying
must
it
be
to
an
Englishman
,
after
he
have
find
himself
solac'd
<EOS>
with
a
relation
of
so
many
surprising
success
of
her
Majesty
's
arm
,
under
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
;
success
that
have
lay'd
before
our
Eyes
Provinces
and
Kingdoms
reduc'd
,
and
town
and
Fortresses
take
and
reliev'd
;
where
we
have
see
a
continu'd
series
of
happy
event
,
the
fruit
of
Conduct
and
Vigilance
;
and
Caution
and
Foresight
prevent
danger
that
be
hold
,
at
first
View
,
certain
and
unsurmountable
:
to
change
this
glorious
Landskip
,
I
say
,
for
scene
every
way
different
,
even
while
our
troop
be
as
numerous
as
the
Enemy
,
and
better
provide
,
yet
always
baffle
and
beat
,
and
fly
before
the
Enemy
till
fatally
ruin'd
in
the
Battle
of
Almanza
<EOS>
:
how
mortifying
must
this
be
to
any
Lover
of
his
Country
!
<EOS>
but
I
proceed
to
my
Memoirs
.
  
<EOS>
ALICANT
be
a
Town
of
the
great
Trade
of
any
in
the
Kingdom
of
Valencia
,
have
a
strong
Castle
,
be
situate
on
a
high
Hill
,
which
command
both
Town
and
Harbour
.
<EOS>
in
this
place
I
reside
a
whole
year
;
but
it
be
soon
after
my
first
Arrival
,
that
Major
Collier
(
who
be
shoot
in
the
back
at
Barcelona
,
as
I
have
relate
in
the
Siege
of
that
place
)
hearing
of
me
,
seek
me
out
at
my
Quarters
;
and
,
after
a
particular
enquiry
into
the
Success
of
that
difficult
Task
that
he
leave
me
upon
,
and
my
answering
all
his
Questions
to
satisfaction
(
all
which
he
receiv'd
with
evident
Pleasure
)
<EOS>
he
throw
down
a
purse
of
Pistoles
upon
the
table
;
which
I
refuse
,
he
tell
me
,
in
a
most
handsome
Manner
,
his
friendship
be
not
to
be
preserve
but
by
my
accept
it
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
make
some
very
necessary
Repairs
,
I
pursu'd
<EOS>
the
Orders
I
have
receiv'd
from
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
to
go
upon
the
erect
a
new
Battery
between
the
Castle
and
the
Town
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
task
attend
with
difficulty
,
neither
few
in
number
,
nor
small
in
Consequence
;
for
it
be
to
be
rais'd
upon
a
great
declivity
,
which
must
render
the
work
both
laborious
and
precarious
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
the
good
Fortune
to
effect
it
much
sooner
than
be
expect
;
and
it
be
call'd
<EOS>
Gorge
's
Battery
,
from
the
name
of
the
Governor
then
command
;
who
,
out
of
an
uncommon
Profusion
of
Generosity
,
wet
that
Piece
of
gossip
with
a
distinguish
Bowl
of
Punch

<EOS>
Brigadier
Bougard

when
he

this
work
some
time
after

be
pleas'd
to
honour
it
with
a
singular
Admiration
and
Approbation
,
for
its
Compleatness
,
notwithstanding
its
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
this
work
,
and
the
Siege
of
Cartagena
,
then
in

possession
,
by
the
Duke

bring
the
Lord
Galway
down
to
this
place
.
<EOS>
cartagena
be
of
so
little
Distance
from
Alicant
,
that
we
could
easily
hear
the
Cannon
play
against

and
from
it
,
in
our
Castle
,
where
I
then
be
.
<EOS>
and
I
remember
my
Lord
Galway
,
on
the
fourth
Day
of
the
Siege
,
send
to
know
if
I
could
make
any
useful
Observations
,
as
to
the
Success
of
it
;
I
return'd
,
that
I
be
of
opinion
the
Town
be
surrender'd
,
from
the
sudden
cessation
of
the
Cannon
,
which
,
by
our
News
next
Day
from
the
Place

prov'd
to
be
fact

<EOS>
Cartagena
be
a
small
Sea

Port
Town
in
Murcia

but
have
so
good
an
Harbour
,
that
when
the
famous
Admiral

ask'd
,
which
be
the
three
good
Havens
in

he
readily
return'd

of
this
place
,
a
Detachment
of
Foot
be
send
by
the
Governor

with
some
dragoon
,
to
Elsha

but
it
be
a
place
of
very
little
Strength
they
be
soon
make
Prisoners
of
War
.
  
<EOS>
the
Siege
of
Cartagena
be
over
,
the
Lord
Galway
return'd
to
his
camp
;
and
the
Lord

Guns

<EOS>
His

Lord

who
lose
it
before
he

Possession

by
an
action
as
odd
as
it

scandalous

<EOS>
that
Regiment
have
receive
Orders
to
march
to
the
Lord
Galway
's
Camp
,
under
the
Command
of
their
Lieutenant
-
Colonel
Bateman
,
a
person
before
reputedly
a
good
Officer
,
tho
'
<EOS>
his
Conduct
here
give
People
,
not
invidious
,
too
much
reason
to
call
it
in
question
.
<EOS>
on
his
March
,
he
be
so
very
careless
and
negligent
(
though
he
know
himself
in
a
Country
surround
with
enemy
,
and
that
he
be
to
march
through
a
Wood
,
where
they
every
day
make
their
appearance
in
great
number
)
that
his
soldier
march'd
with
their
Muskets
sling
at
their
Backs
,
and
go
one
after
another
(
as
necessity
have
forc'd
us
to
do
in
Scotland
)
<EOS>
himself
at
the
Head
of
'em
,
in
his
Chaise
,
ride
a
considerable
way
before
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
there
be
a
Captain
,
with
threescore
dragoon
,
<EOS>
detach'd
<EOS>
from
the
Duke
of
Berwick
's
Army
,
with
a
design
to
intercept
some
cash
,
that
be
order'd
to
be
send
to
Lord
Galway
's
Army
from
Alicant
.
<EOS>
this
Detachment
,
miss
of
that
intend
Prize
,
be
return
very
disconsolately
,
re
infecta
;
when
their
Captain
,
observe
that
careless
and
disorderly
March
of
the
English
,
resolv'd
,
boldly
enough
,
to
attack
them
in
the
Wood
.
<EOS>
to
that
purpose
he
secrete
his
little
Party
behind
a
great
barn
;
and
so
soon
as
they
be
half
pass
by
,
he
fall
upon
'em
in
the
Center
with
his
dragoon
,
cut
and
slash
at
such
a
violent
rate
,
that
he
soon
disperse
the
whole
Regiment
,
leave
many
dead
and
wound
upon
the
Spot
.
<EOS>
the
three
Colours
be
take
;
and
the
gallant
Lieutenant
-
Colonel
take
out
of
his
Chaise
,
and
carry
away
Prisoner
with
many
other
;
only
one
officer
who
be
an
ensign
,
and
so
bold
as
to
do
his
Duty
,
be
kill'd
.
  
<EOS>
the
Lieutenant
who
command
the
Granadiers
,
receive
the
Alarm
time
enough
to
draw
his
man
into
a
House
in
their
way
;
where
he
bravely
defend
himself
for
a
long
time
;
but
be
kill
,
the
rest
immediately
surrender'd
.
<EOS>
the
Account
of
this
action
I
have
from
the
Commander
of
the
Enemy
's
Party
himself
,
some
Time
after
,
while
I
be
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
and
Captain
Mahoni
,
who
be
present
when
the
News
be
bring
,
that
a
few
spanish
Dragoons
have
defeat
an
English
Regiment
,
which
be
this
under
Bateman
,
protest
to
me
,
that
the
Duke
of
Berwick
turn'd
pale
at
the
relation
;
and
when
they
offer'd
to
bring
the
Colours
before
him
,
he
would
not
so
much
as
see
them
.
<EOS>
a
little
before
the
Duke
go
to
Supper
,
Bateman
himself
be
bring
to
him
,
but
the
Duke
turn'd
<EOS>
away
from
him
without
any
further
Notice
than
coldly
say
,
that
he
think
he
be
very
strangely
take
.
<EOS>
the
Wags
of
the
Army
make
a
thorough
jest
of
him
,
and
say
his
military
Conduct
be
of
a
piece
with
his
Oeconomy
,
have
two
day
before
this
March
,
send
his
young
handsome
Wife
into
England
,
under
the
Guardship
of
the
young
Chaplain

<EOS>
April
15
.
<EOS>
in
the
Year
1707
,
be
Easter
Monday
,
we
have
in
the
morning
a
flying
report
in
Alicant
,
that
there
have
be
the
day
before
a
battle
at
Almanza
,
between
the
Army
under
the
Command
of
the
Duke
of
Berwick
,
and
that
of
the
English
,
under
Lord
Galway
,
in
which
the
latter
have
suffer'd
<EOS>
an
entire
defeat
.
<EOS>
We
at
first
give
no
great
credit
to
it
:
<EOS>
but
,
alas
,
we
be
too
soon
woefully
convince
of
the
Truth
of
it
,
by
number
that
come
fly
to
us
from
the
conquer
Enemy
.
<EOS>
then
indeed
we
be
satisfied
of
truth
,
too
difficult
before
to
be
credit
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
not
present
in
that
calamitous
Battle
,
I
shall
relate
it
,
as
I
receive
it
from
an
Officer
then
in
the
Duke
's
Army
.
  
<EOS>
to
bring
the
Lord
Galway
to
a
battle
,
in
a
place
most
commodious
for
his
purpose
,
the
Duke
make
use
of
this
stratagem
:
He
order
two
Irishmen
,
both
officer
,
to
make
their
way
over
to
the
Enemy
as
Deserters
;
put
this
story
in
their
mouth
,
that
the
Duke
of
Orleans
be
in
a
full
March
to
join
the
Duke
of
Berwick
with
twelve
thousand
Men
;
that
this
would
be
do
in
two
day
,
and
that
then
they
would
find
out
the
Lord
Galway
,
and
force
him
to
Fight
,
where
-
ever
they
find
him
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Galway
,
who
at
this
time
lie
before
Villena
,
receive
this
intelligence
from
those
well
instruct
Deserters
,
immediately
rais'd
<EOS>
the
Siege
;
with
a
Resolution
,
by
a
hasty
March
,
to
force
the
Enemy
to
Battle
,
before
the
Duke
of
Orleans
should
be
able
to
join
the
Duke
of
Berwick
.
<EOS>
to
effect
this
,
after
a
hard
March
of
three
long
Spanish
Leagues
in
the
heat
of
the
day
;
he
appear
a
little
after
Noon
in
the
face
of
the
Enemy
with
his
fatigu'd
force
.
<EOS>
Glad
and
rejoyc'd
<EOS>
at
the
Sight
,
for
he
find
his
Plot
have
take
;
Berwick
,
the
well
to
receive
him
,
draw
up
his
Army
in
a
half
moon
,
place
at
a
pretty
good
advance
three
regiment
to
make
up
the
Centre
,
with
express
order
,
nevertheless
,
to
retreat
at
the
very
first
charge
.
<EOS>
all
which
be
punctually
observ'd
,
and
have
its
desire
effect
;
for
the
three
Regiments
,
at
the
first
Attack
give
way
,
and
seemingly
flee
towards
their
camp
;
the
English
,
after
their
customary
manner
,
pursue
them
with
Shouts
and
Hollowings
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
Duke
of
Berwick
perceiv'd
<EOS>
his
trap
have
take
,
he
order'd
<EOS>
his
right
and
leave
wing
to
close
;
by
which
Means
<EOS>
,
he
at
once
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
their
Army
all
those
who
have
so
eagerly
pursu'd
<EOS>
the
imaginary
Runaways
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
Rout
be
total
,
and
the
most
fatal
Blow
that
ever
the
English
receiv'd
<EOS>
during
the
whole
War
with
Spain
.
<EOS>
nor
,
as
it
be
think
,
with
a
great
probability
of
Reason
,
have
those
troop
that
make
their
retreat
to
the
top
of
the
Hills
,
under
Major
General
Shrimpton
,
meet
with
any
well
Fate
than
those
on
the
Plain
,
have
the
Spaniards
have
any
other
General
in
the
Command
than
the
Duke
of
Berwick
;
whose
native
Sympathy
give
a
check
to
the
Ardour
of
a
victorious
Enemy
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
sense
of
the
Spaniards
themselves
after
the
Battle
.
<EOS>
Verifying
herein
that
noble
Maxim
,
that
victory
to
generous
Minds
be
only
an
inducement
to
Moderation
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
after
this
fatal
Battle
(
which
give
occasion
to
a
spanish
piece
of
Wit
,
that
the
English
General
have
route
the
French
)
the
Duke
of
Orleans
do
arrive
indeed
in
the
Camp
,
but
with
an
Army
of
only
fourteen
attendant
.
  
<EOS>
the
fatal
effect
of
this
battle
be
soon
make
visible
,
and
to
none
more
than
those
in
Alicant
.
<EOS>
the
Enemy
grow
every
day
more
and
more
troublesome
;
visit
us
in
party
more
boldly
than
before
:
and
often
hover
about
us
so
very
near
,
that
with
our
cannon
we
could
hardly
teach
'em
to
keep
a
proper
Distance
.
<EOS>
Gorge
the
Governor
of
Alicant
be
recall'd
into
England
,
Major
General
Richards
be
by
King
Charles
appoint
Governor
in
his
place
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
Roman
Catholick
,
and
very
much
belov'd
<EOS>
by
the
Natives
on
that
account
;
tho
"
to
give
him
his
due
,
he
behave
himself
extremely
well
in
all
other
Respects
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
his
Time
,
that
a
design
be
lay
of
surprising
Guardamere
,
a
small
Sea
-
port
Town
,
in
Murcia
:
<EOS>
but
the
military
Bishop
(
for
he
be
in
a
literal
Sense
excellent
tam
Marte
,
quam
Mercurio
,
among
his
many
other
exploit
)
,
by
a
timely
Expedition
,
prevent
that
.
  
<EOS>
Governor
Richards
,
my
post
be
always
in
the
Castle
,
have
send
to
desire
me
to
give
notice
whenever
I
see
any
Parties
of
the
Enemy
move
.
<EOS>
pursuant
to
this
order
,
discover
one
morning
a
considerable
body
of
Horse
towards
Elsha
,
I
go
down
into
the
Town
,
and
tell
the
Governor
what
I
have
see
;
and
without
any
delay
he
give
his
Orders
,
that
a
captain
with
threescore
man
should
attend
me
to
an
old
House
about
a
Mile
distance
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
have
get
into
it
,
I
set
about
barricade
all
the
open
Places
,
and
Avenues
,
and
put
my
men
in
a
Posture
ready
to
receive
an
Enemy
,
as
soon
as
he
should
appear
;
upon
which
the
Captain
,
as
a
feint
,
order
a
few
of
his
man
to
shew
themselves
on
a
rise
ground
just
before
the
House
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
like
to
have
catch
a
tartar
:
for
tho
'
the
Enemy
take
the
train
I
have
lay
,
and
on
sight
of
our
small
body
on
the
Hill
,
send
a
Party
from
their
great
body
to
intercept
them
,
before
they
could
reach
the
Town
;
yet
the
Sequel
prov'd
,
we
have
mistake
their
number
and
it
soon
appear
to
be
much
great
than
we
at
first
<EOS>
imagin'd
.
<EOS>
however
our
out
-
scout
,
as
I
may
call
'em
,
get
safe
into
the
House
;
and
on
the
appearance
of
the
Party
,
we
let
fly
a
full
volly
,
which
lay
dead
on
the
Spot
three
Men
and
one
Horse
.
<EOS>
hereupon
the
whole
body
make
up
to
the
House
,
but
stand
a
-
loof
upon
the
Hill
without
reach
of
our
shot
.
<EOS>
We
soon
see
our
Danger
from
the
number
of
the
enemy
:
<EOS>
and
well
for
us
it
be
,
that
the
watchful
Governor
have
take
notice
of
it
,
as
well
as
we
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
for
observe
us
surround
with
the
Enemy
,
and
by
a
Power
so
much
superior
,
he
march
himself
with
a
good
part
of
the
Garrison
to
our
Relief
.
<EOS>
the
Enemy
stand
a
little
time
as
if
they
would
receive
'em
;
but
upon
second
thought
they
retir'd
;
and
to
our
no
little
Joy
leave
us
at
Liberty
to
come
out
of
the
House
and
join
the
Garrison
.
  
<EOS>
Scarce
a
day
<EOS>
pass'd
<EOS>
but
we
have
some
visit
of
the
like
kind
attend
sometimes
with
rencounter
of
this
nature
;
in
so
much
that
there
be
hardly
any
stir
out
in
Safety
for
small
Parties
,
tho
'
never
so
little
away
.
<EOS>
there
be
within
a
little
Mile
of
the
Town
,
an
old
Vineyard
,
environ
with
a
loose
stone
Wall
:
<EOS>
an
Officer
and
I
make
an
Agreement
to
ride
thither
for
an
airing
.
<EOS>
We
do
so
,
and
after
a
little
riding
,
it
come
into
my
Head
to
put
a
Fright
upon
the
Officer
.
<EOS>
and
very
lucky
for
us
both
be
that
unlucky
thought
of
mine
;
pretend
to
see
a
Party
of
the
Enemy
make
up
to
us
<EOS>
,
I
give
him
the
Alarm
,
set
Spurs
to
my
horse
,
and
rid
as
fast
as
Legs
could
carry
me
.
<EOS>
the
Officer
no
way
bate
of
his
Speed
;
and
we
have
scarce
get
out
of
the
Vineyard
but
my
Jest
prov'd
earnest
,
twelve
of
the
Enemy
's
Horse
pursue
us
to
the
very
Gates
of
the
Town
.
<EOS>
nor
could
I
ever
after
prevail
upon
my
Fellow
-
traveller
to
believe
that
he
ow'd
his
escape
to
Merriment
more
than
Speed
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
my
charge
,
as
to
the
Fortifications
,
be
pretty
well
over
,
I
<EOS>
obtain'd
Leave
of
the
Governor
to
be
absent
for
a
Fortnight
,
upon
some
Affairs
of
my
own
at
Valencia
.
<EOS>
on
my
return
from
whence
,
at
a
Town
call'd
Venissa
,
I
meet
two
officer
of
an
English
Regiment
,
go
to
the
place
from
whence
<EOS>
I
last
come
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
,
after
common
congratulation
,
that
they
have
leave
Major
Boyd
,
at
a
little
Place
<EOS>
call'd
Capel
,
hire
another
Mule
,
that
he
ride
on
thither
have
tir'd
and
fail'd
him
;
desire
withal
,
that
if
I
meet
him
,
I
would
let
him
know
that
they
would
stay
for
him
at
that
place
.
<EOS>
I
have
another
Gentleman
in
my
company
,
and
we
have
travell'd
on
not
above
a
League
further
,
whence
,
at
a
little
Distance
,
we
be
both
surpriz'd
with
a
Sight
that
seem'd
to
have
set
all
art
at
defiance
,
and
be
too
odd
for
any
thing
in
Nature
.
<EOS>
It
appear'd
all
in
red
,
and
to
move
;
but
so
very
slowly
,
that
if
we
have
not
make
more
way
to
that
than
it
do
to
us
,
we
should
have
make
it
a
Day
's
Journey
before
we
meet
it
.
<EOS>
My
companion
could
as
little
tell
what
to
make
of
it
as
I
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
nearer
it
come
<EOS>
the
more
monstrous
it
<EOS>
seem'd
,
have
nothing
of
the
Tokens
of
Man
,
either
walking
,
Riding
,
or
in
any
Posture
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
come
up
with
this
strange
figure
of
a
creature
(
for
now
we
find
it
be
certainly
such
)
<EOS>
what
,
or
rather
who
,
should
it
prove
to
be
,
but
Major
Boyd
?
<EOS>
He
be
a
person
of
himself
far
from
one
of
the
least
proportion
,
and
mount
on
a
poor
little
Ass
,
with
all
his
warlike
accoutrement
upon
it
,
you
will
allow
must
make
a
figure
almost
as
odd
as
one
of
the
old
Centaurs
.
<EOS>
the
Morocco
Saddle
that
cover'd
<EOS>
the
Ass
be
of
Burden
enough
for
the
Beast
without
its
Master
;
and
the
additional
Holsters
and
Pistols
make
it
much
more
weighty
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
a
Curb
Bridle
of
the
large
size
cover'd
<EOS>
his
little
Head
,
and
a
long
red
Cloak
,
hang
down
to
the
ground
,
<EOS>
cover'd
Jackboots
,
Ass
,
Master
and
all
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
my
companion
and
I
,
after
we
could
specifically
declare
it
to
be
a
man
,
agree
we
never
see
a
figure
so
comical
in
all
our
life
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
merrily
greet
our
Major
(
for
a
Cynick
could
not
have
forborn
Laughter
)
<EOS>
He
excus'd
all
as
well
as
he
could
,
by
say
he
could
get
no
other
Beast
.
<EOS>
after
which
,
deliver
our
message
,
and
condole
with
him
for
his
present
mounting
,
and
wish
him
better
at
his
next
Quarters
,
he
settle
into
his
old
pace
,
and
we
into
ours
,
and
part
.
  
<EOS>
We
lay
that
night
at
Altea
,
famous
for
its
Bay
for
Ships
to
water
at
.
<EOS>
It
stand
on
a
high
Hill
;
and
be
adorn'd
,
not
defend
,
with
an
old
Fort
.
  
<EOS>
thence
we
come
to
Alicant
,
where
have
now
be
a
whole
year
,
and
have
effect
what
be
hold
necessary
,
I
once
more
prevail'd
upon
the
Governor
to
permit
me
to
take
another
Journey
.
<EOS>
the
Lord
Galway
lie
at
Tarraga
,
while
Lerida
lie
under
the
Siege
of
the
Duke
of
Orleans
;
and
have
some
Grounds
of
expectation
give
me
,
while
he
be
at
Alicant
,
I
resolv'd
at
least
to
demonstrate
I
be
still
live
.
<EOS>
the
Governor
favour'd
me
with
letter
,
not
at
all
to
my
disadvantage
;
so
take
ship
for
Barcelona
,
just
at
our
putting
into
the
Harbour
,
we
meet
with
the
English
Fleet
,
on
its
return
from
the
Expedition
to
Toulon
under
Sir
Cloudsly
Shovel
.
  
<EOS>
I
stay'd
<EOS>
but
very
few
day
at
Barcelona
,
and
then
proceed
on
my
intended
Journey
to
Tarraga
;
arrive
at
which
<EOS>
place
<EOS>
I
deliver'd
<EOS>
my
packet
to
the
Lord
Galway
,
who
receiv'd
me
with
very
great
civility
;
and
to
double
it
,
acquaint
me
at
the
same
time
,
that
the
Governor
of
Alicant
have
write
very
much
in
my
favour
:
<EOS>
but
though
it
be
a
know
part
of
that
noble
Lord
's
Character
,
that
the
first
impression
be
generally
strong
,
I
have
Reason
soon
after
to
close
with
another
saying
,
equally
true
,
that
general
rule
always
admit
of
some
Exception
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
here
we
have
News
of
the
taking
of
the
Town
of
Lerida
;
the
Prince
of
Hesse
(
brother
to
that
brave
Prince
who
lose
his
life
before
Monjouick
)
retire
into
the
Castle
with
the
Garrison
,
which
he
bravely
defend
a
long
time
after
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
thus
attend
my
Lord
Galway
at
Tarraga
,
he
receiv'd
Intelligence
that
the
Enemy
have
a
design
to
lay
Siege
to
Denia
;
whereupon
he
give
me
order
to
repair
there
as
Engineer
.
<EOS>
after
I
have
receiv'd
<EOS>
my
order
,
and
take
Leave
of
his
lordship
<EOS>
,
I
set
out
,
resolve
,
since
it
be
leave
to
my
Choice
,
to
go
by
way
of
Barcelona
,
and
there
take
shipping
for
the
place
of
my
Station
;
by
which
I
propos'd
to
save
more
time
than
would
allow
me
a
full
opportunity
of
visit
Montserat
,
a
place
I
have
hear
much
talk
of
,
which
have
fill'd
me
with
a
long
desire
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
to
say
Truth
,
I
have
be
tell
such
extravagant
thing
of
the
Place
,
that
I
could
hardly
impute
more
than
one
half
of
it
to
any
thing
but
Spanish
Rhodomontado
's
,
the
Vice
of
extravagant
exaggeration
be
too
natural
to
that
nation
.
  
<EOS>
MONTSERAT
be
a
rise
lofty
Hill
,
in
the
very
middle
of
a
spacious
Plain
,
in
the
Principality
of
Catalonia
,
about
seven
league
distant
from
Barcelona
to
the
Westward
,
somewhat
incline
to
the
North
.
<EOS>
at
the
very
first
Sight
,
its
Oddness
of
Figure
promise
something
extraordinary
;
and
give
at
that
Distance
the
Prospect
make
somewhat
of
a
grand
appearance
:
<EOS>
hundred
of
aspire
pyramid
present
themselves
all
at
once
to
the
Eye
,
look
,
if
I
may
be
allow
so
to
speak
,
like
a
little
petrify'd
Forrest
;
or
,
rather
,
like
the
awful
Ruins
of
some
capacious
Structure
,
the
Labour
of
venerable
antiquity
.
<EOS>
the
nearer
you
approach
the
more
it
affect
;
but
till
you
be
very
near
you
can
hardly
form
in
your
mind
any
thing
like
what
you
find
it
when
you
come
close
to
it
.
<EOS>
till
just
upon
it
you
would
imagine
it
a
perfect
Hill
of
Steeples
;
but
so
intermingled
with
Trees
of
Magnitude
,
as
well
as
Beauty
,
that
your
admiration
can
never
be
tir'd
,
or
your
curiosity
surfeited
.
<EOS>
such
I
find
it
on
my
approach
;
yet
much
less
than
what
I
find
it
,
be
so
soon
as
I
enter'd
<EOS>
upon
the
very
Premisses
.
  
<EOS>
now
that
stupendious
Cluster
of
Pyramids
affect
me
in
a
Manner
different
to
all
before
;
and
I
find
it
so
finely
<EOS>
group'd
with
verdant
Groves
,
and
here
and
there
interspers'd
with
aspire
,
but
solitary
tree
,
that
it
no
way
lessen
my
admiration
,
while
it
increase
my
Delight
.
<EOS>
those
tree
,
which
I
call
solitary
,
as
stand
single
,
in
opposition
to
the
numerous
Groves
,
which
be
close
and
thick
(
as
I
observ'd
when
I
ascend
to
take
a
view
of
the
several
cell
)
rise
generally
out
of
the
very
Clefts
of
the
main
Rock
,
with
nothing
,
to
Appearance
,
but
a
soil
or
bed
of
Stone
for
their
Nurture
.
<EOS>
but
though
some
few
Naturalists
may
assert
,
that
the
Nitre
in
the
Stone
may
afford
a
due
proportion
of
Nourishment
to
Trees
and
vegetable
;
these
,
in
my
opinion
,
be
all
too
beautiful
,
their
Bark
,
Leaf
,
and
flower
,
carry'd
<EOS>
too
fair
a
Face
of
Health
,
to
allow
them
even
to
be
the
Foster
-
child
of
Rock
and
Stone
only
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
Hill
,
or
if
you
please
,
Grove
of
Rocks
,
be
thirteen
Hermits
Cells
,
the
last
of
which
lie
near
the
very
Summit
.
<EOS>
You
gradually
advance
to
every
one
,
from
Bottom
to
Top
,
by
a
wind
ascent
;
which
to
do
would
otherwise
be
impossible
,
by
reason
of
the
Steepness
;
but
though
there
be
a
wind
ascent
to
every
Cell
,
as
I
have
say
,
I
would
yet
set
at
defiance
the
most
observant
,
if
a
Stranger
,
to
find
it
feasible
to
visit
them
in
order
,
if
not
precaution'd
to
follow
the
poor
Borigo

Ass

very
Foot
of
the
Hill
,
where
every
partition
be
supply'd
with
their
several
allowance
of
Victuals
and
Wine
.
<EOS>
which
,
as
soon
as
he
have
receiv'd
,
without
any
further
Attendance
,
or
any
Guide
,
he
mount
and
take
the
cell
gradually
,
in
their
due
course
,
till
he
reach
the
very
uppermost
.
<EOS>
where
have
discharg'd
<EOS>
his
Duty
,
he
descend
the
same
way
,
light
by
the
Load
he
carry'd
up
.
<EOS>
this
the
poor
stupid
Drudge
fail
not
to
do
,
Day
and
Night
,
at
the
stated
hour
.
  
<EOS>
two
gentleman
,
who
have
join'd
me
on
the
Road
,
alike
lead
by
Curiosity
,
seem'd
alike
delighted
,
that
the
end
of
it
be
so
well
<EOS>
answer'd
.
<EOS>
I
could
easily
discover
in
their
countenance
a
Satisfaction
,
which
,
if
it
do
not
give
a
sanction
to
my
own
,
much
confirm'd
<EOS>
it
,
while
they
seem'd
to
allow
with
me
that
these
reverend
Solitaries
be
truly
happy
man
;
I
then
think
them
such
;
and
a
thousand
time
since
,
reflect
within
my
self
,
have
wish'd
,
bate
their
error
,
and
less
superstition
,
my
self
as
happily
station'd
:
<EOS>
for
what
can
there
be
want
to
a
happy
Life
,
where
all
thing
necessary
be
provide
without
Care
?
<EOS>
where
the
Days
,
without
Anxiety
or
Troubles
,
may
be
gratefully
pass
away
,
with
an
innocent
variety
of
divert
and
pleasing
object
,
and
where
their
Sleep
sand
slumber
be
never
interrupt
with
any
thing
more
offensive
,
than
murmur
Springs
,
natural
Cascades
,
or
the
various
Songs
of
the
pretty
feather'd
Quiristers
.
  
<EOS>
but
their
courtesy
to
stranger
be
no
less
engaging
than
their
Solitude
.
<EOS>
a
recluse
life
,
for
the
fruit
of
it
,
generally
speak
,
produce
Moroseness
;
Pharisaical
Pride
too
often
sour
the
Temper
;
and
a
mistaken
Opinion
of
their
own
Merit
too
naturally
lead
such
man
into
a
Contempt
of
other
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
these
good
man
(
for
I
must
call
them
as
I
think
them
)
<EOS>
seem'd
<EOS>
to
me
<EOS>
the
very
emblem
of
innocence
;
so
ready
to
oblige
other
,
that
at
the
same
instant
they
seem'd
lay
obligation
upon
themselves
.
<EOS>
this
be
self
-
evident
,
in
that
Affability
and
Complaisance
they
use
in
shew
the
Rarities
of
their
several
cell
;
where
,
for
fear
you
should
slip
any
thing
worthy
Observation
,
they
endeavour
to
instil
in
you
as
quick
a
Propensity
of
asking
,
as
you
find
in
them
a
prompt
Alacrity
in
answer
such
Questions
of
Curiosity
as
their
own
have
inspir'd
.
  
<EOS>
in
particular
,
I
remember
one
of
those
reverend
old
Men
,
when
we
be
take
Leave
at
the
Door
of
his
Cell
,
to
which
out
of
his
great
Civility
he
<EOS>
accompany'd
us
,
find
by
the
air
of
our
Faces
,
as
well
as
our
Expressions
<EOS>
,
that
we
think
ourselves
pleasingly
entertain'd
;
to
divert
us
afresh
,
advanc'd
a
few
pace
from
the
Door
,
when
give
a
Whistle
with
his
Mouth
,
a
surprising
Flock
of
pretty
little
Birds
,
variegate
,
and
of
different
colour
,
immediately
<EOS>
flock'd
around
him
.
<EOS>
here
you
should
see
some
alighting
upon
his
Shoulders
,
some
on
his
awful
Beard
;
other
take
Refuge
on
his
snow
-
like
Head
,
and
many
feeding
,
and
more
endeavouring
to
feed
out
of
his
Mouth
;
each
appear
emulous
and
under
an
innocent
Contention
,
how
best
to
express
their
love
and
respect
to
their
no
less
pleased
Master
.
  
<EOS>
nor
do
the
other
Cells
labour
under
any
Deficiency
of
Variety
<EOS>
:
every
one
boasting
in
some
particular
,
that
may
distinguish
it
in
something
equally
agreeable
and
entertaining
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
crystal
Springs
spout
from
the
solid
rock
be
,
from
the
high
to
the
low
,
common
to
them
all
;
and
,
in
most
of
them
,
they
have
little
brass
cock
,
out
of
which
,
when
turn'd
<EOS>
,
issu'd
the
most
cool
and
crystalline
flow
of
excellent
pure
Water
.
<EOS>
and
yet
what
more
affect
me
,
and
which
I
find
near
more
cell
than
one
,
be
the
natural
cascade
of
the
same
transparent
element
;
these
fall
from
one
Rock
to
another
,
in
that
warm
,
or
rather
hot
Climate
,
give
not
more
delightful
astonishment
to
the
Eye
,
than
they
afford
grateful
Refreshment
to
the
whole
man
.
<EOS>
the
Streams
fall
from
these
,
soften
,
from
a
rougher
tumultuous
noise
,
into
such
affect
Murmurs
,
by
Distance
,
the
intervention
of
Groves
,
or
neighbouring
Rocks
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
see
or
hear
them
and
not
be
chann'd
.
  
<EOS>
neither
be
those
grove
grateful
only
in
a
beautiful
verdure
;
nature
render
them
otherwise
delightful
,
in
load
them
with
Clusters
of
berry
of
a
perfect
scarlet
Colour
,
which
,
by
a
beautiful
intermixture
,
strike
the
Eye
with
additional
delight
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
may
nonplus
a
Person
of
the
nice
taste
,
to
distinguish
or
determine
,
whether
the
neatness
of
their
cell
within
,
or
the
beauteous
variety
without
,
most
exhaust
his
admiration
.
<EOS>
nor
be
the
Whole
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
little
advantag'd
<EOS>
by
the
frequent
view
of
some
of
those
pyramidical
pillar
,
which
seem
,
as
weary
of
their
own
Weight
,
to
recline
and
seek
support
from
other
in
the
Neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
mention'd
the
outside
Beauties
of
their
cell
,
I
must
be
think
to
have
forget
to
particularize
the
glorious
prospect
present
to
your
eye
from
every
one
of
them
;
but
especially
from
that
near
the
Summit
.
<EOS>
a
Prospect
,
by
reason
of
the
Purity
of
the
air
,
so
extensive
,
and
so
very
entertaining
that
to
dilate
upon
it
properly
to
one
that
never
see
it
,
would
baffle
Credit
;
and
naturally
to
depaint
it
,
would
confound
Invention
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
shall
only
say
,
that
on
the
Mediterranean
Side
,
after
an
agreeable
interval
of
some
fair
league
,
it
will
set
at
defiance
the
strong
optick
;
and
although
Barcelona
bound
it
on
the
Land
,
the
eye
be
feast
with
the
delight
of
such
an
intervene
Champion
(
where
beauteous
Nature
do
not
only
smile
,
but
riot
)
that
the
Sense
must
be
very
temperate
,
or
very
weak
,
that
can
be
soon
or
easily
satisfy'd
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
take
a
view
of
all
their
refreshing
Springs
,
their
grateful
Groves
,
and
solitary
Shades
under
single
tree
,
whose
cluster
prov'd
<EOS>
that
even
rock
be
grow
fruitful
;
and
have
run
over
all
the
Variety
of
Pleasures
in
their
several
pretty
Cells
,
decently
set
off
with
Gardens
round
the
,
equally
fragrant
and
beautiful
,
we
be
bring
down
again
to
the
Convent
,
which
,
though
on
a
small
Ascent
,
lie
very
near
the
Foot
of
this
terrestrial
Paradise
,
there
to
take
a
survey
of
their
sumptuous
Hall
,
much
more
sumptuous
Chapel
,
and
its
adjoin
repository
;
and
feast
our
eye
with
Wonders
of
a
different
nature
;
and
yet
as
entertaining
as
any
,
or
all
<EOS>
,
we
have
see
before
.
  
<EOS>
immediately
on
our
Descent
,
a
Priest
present
himself
at
the
Door
of
the
Convent
,
ready
to
shew
us
the
hide
Rarities
.
<EOS>
and
though
,
as
I
understand
,
hardly
a
day
pass
without
the
Resort
of
some
stranger
to
gratify
their
curiosity
with
the
Wonders
of
the
place
;
yet
be
there
,
on
every
such
Occasion
,
a
superior
concourse
of
Natives
ready
to
see
over
again
,
out
of
meer
Bigotry
and
Superstition
,
what
they
have
see
,
perhaps
,
a
hundred
time
before
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
avoid
take
notice
,
however
,
that
the
Priest
treat
those
constant
visitant
with
much
less
ceremony
,
or
more
freedom
,
if
you
please
,
than
any
of
the
stranger
of
what
nation
soever
;
or
,
indeed
,
he
seem'd
to
take
as
much
pain
to
disoblige
those
,
as
he
do
Pleasure
in
oblige
us
.
  
<EOS>
the
Hall
be
neat
,
large
and
stately
;
but
be
plain
and
unadorn'd
with
more
than
decent
decoration
,
suitable
to
such
a
Society
,
I
hasten
to
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
enter'd
the
Chapel
,
our
eye
be
immediately
attract
by
the
image
of
our
Lady
of
Montserat
(
as
they
call
it
)
which
stand
over
the
Altar
-
Piece
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
the
natural
stature
;
but
as
black
and
shine
as
Ebony
it
self
.
<EOS>
Most
would
imagine
it
make
of
that
material
;
though
her
Retinue
and
Adorers
will
allow
nothing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
Tradition
,
which
with
them
be
,
on
some
Occasions
,
more
than
tantamount
to
Religion
,
have
assur'd
them
,
and
they
relate
it
as
undoubted
Matter
of
Fact
,
that
her
present
Colour
,
if
I
may
so
call
it
,
proceed
from
her
Concealment
,
in
the
Time
of
the
Moors
,
between
those
two
rock
on
which
the
Chapel
be
found
;
and
that
her
long
lie
in
that
dismal
place
<EOS>
chang'd
<EOS>
her
once
lovely
white
into
its
present
opposite
.
<EOS>
Would
not
a
Heretick
here
be
apt
to
say
,
that
it
be
greaty
pity
that
an
image
which
still
boast
the
Power
of
act
so
many
miracle
,
could
no
better
conserve
her
own
complexion
?
<EOS>
at
least
it
must
be
allow'd
,
even
by
a
good
Catholick
,
to
carry
along
with
it
Matter
of
Reproach
to
the
fair
Ladies
,
Natives
of
the
Country
,
for
their
unnatural
and
excessive
affection
of
adulterating
,
if
not
deface
,
their
beautiful
face
,
with
the
ruinate
Dauberies
of
Carmine
?
  
<EOS>
as
the
Custom
of
the
place
be
(
which
be
likewise
allow'd
<EOS>
to
be
a
distinguish
Piece
of
Civility
to
stranger
)
when
we
approach
the
black
Lady
(
who
,
I
should
have
tell
you
,
bear
a
child
in
her
arm
;
but
whether
maternally
black
,
or
of
the
Mulatto
Kind
<EOS>
,
I
protest
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
)
<EOS>
the
Priest
,
in
great
Civility
,
offer
you
her
Arm
to
salute
;
at
which
Juncture
,
I
,
like
a
true
blue
Protestant
,
mistake
my
Word
of
Command
,
fall
foul
on
the
fair
Lady
's
face
.
<EOS>
the
Displeasure
in
his
Countenance
(
for
he
take
more
notice
of
the
Rudeness
than
the
good
Lady
her
self
)
<EOS>
soon
convinc'd
me
of
my
error
;
however
,
as
a
great
Token
of
his
civility
,
have
admit
no
Spaniards
along
with
my
Companions
and
me
,
be
pass'd
off
the
well
;
and
his
after
civility
manifest
,
that
he
be
willing
to
reform
my
ignorance
by
his
Complaisance
.
  
<EOS>
to
demonstrate
which
,
upon
my
tell
him
that
I
have
a
Set
of
bead
,
which
I
must
entreat
him
to
consecrate
for
me
,
he
readily
,
nay
eagerly
comply'd
;
and
have
hang
them
on
her
Arm
for
the
Space
of
about
half
,
or
somewhat
short
of
a
whole
Minute
,
he
return'd
me
<EOS>
the
holy
Baubles
with
a
great
deal
of
Address
and
most
evident
Satisfaction
.
<EOS>
the
reader
will
be
apt
to
admire
at
this
curious
Piece
of
Superstition
of
mine
,
till
I
have
tell
him
,
that
even
rigid
Protestants
have
,
in
this
Country
,
think
it
but
prudent
to
do
the
like
;
and
likewise
have
so
do
,
to
carry
them
about
their
person
,
or
in
their
pocket
:
for
experience
have
convinc'd
us
of
the
Necessity
of
this
most
Catholick
Precaution
;
since
those
who
have
here
,
travel
or
otherwise
,
come
to
their
Ends
,
whether
by
Accident
,
Sickness
,
or
the
course
of
Nature
,
not
have
these
sanctify
Seals
find
upon
them
,
have
ever
be
refus'd
Christian
Burial
,
under
a
superstitious
imagination
,
that
the
Corps
of
a
Heretick
will
infect
every
thing
near
it
.
  
<EOS>
two
instance
of
this
kind
fall
within
my
knowledge
;
one
before
I
come
to
Montserat
,
the
other
after
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
of
one
Slunt
,
who
have
be
bombardi
at
Monjouick
;
but
be
kill'd
while
we
lie
at
Campilio
,
a
Priest
,
whom
I
advis'd
<EOS>
with
upon
the
Matter
,
tell
me
,
that
if
he
should
be
bury
where
any
corn
grow
,
his
Body
would
not
only
be
take
up
again
,
but
ill
treat
,
in
revenge
of
the
destruction
of
so
much
corn
,
which
the
People
would
on
no
account
be
persuade
to
touch
;
for
which
reason
we
take
care
to
have
him
lay'd
in
a
very
deep
Grave
,
on
a
very
barren
Spot
of
Ground
.
<EOS>
the
other
be
of
one
Captain
Bush
,
who
be
a
prisoner
with
me
on
the
surrender
of
Denia
;
who
be
send
,
as
I
be
afterwards
,
to
Saint
Clemente
la
Mancha
,
there
dy'd
;
and
,
as
I
be
inform'd
,
tho
'
he
be
privately
,
and
by
Night
,
bury'd
in
a
Corn
-
Field
,
he
be
take
out
of
his
Grave
by
those
superstitious
People
,
as
soon
as
ever
they
could
discover
the
place
where
his
body
be
deposit
.
<EOS>
but
I
return
to
the
Convent
at
Montserat
.
  
<EOS>
out
of
the
Chapel
,
behind
the
High
-
Altar
<EOS>
,
we
descend
into
a
spacious
Room
,
the
Repository
of
the
great
offering
make
to
the
Lady
.
<EOS>
here
,
though
I
think
in
the
Chapel
<EOS>
it
self
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
Riches
of
the
Universe
,
I
find
a
prodigious
quantity
of
more
costly
Presents
,
the
superstitious
Tribute
of
most
of
the
roman
-
Catholick
Princes
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
among
a
Multitude
of
other
,
they
show'd
me
a
Sword
set
with
diamond
,
the
offering
of
Charles
the
Third
,
then
King
of
Spain
,
but
now
Emperor
of
Germany
.
<EOS>
though
I
must
confess
,
be
a
Heretick
,
I
could
much
easier
find
a
reason
for
a
fair
Lady
's
present
such
a
Sword
to
a
king
of
Spain
,
than
for
a
King
of
Spain
's
present
such
a
Sword
to
a
fair
Lady
:
<EOS>
and
by
the
Motto
upon
it
,
Pulchra
tamen
nigra
,
it
be
plain
such
be
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
that
Prince
be
so
delighted
with
the
Pleasure
's
of
this
sweet
Place
,
that
he
,
as
well
as
I
,
stay'd
as
long
as
ever
he
could
;
though
neither
of
us
so
long
as
either
could
have
wish'd
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
another
offering
from
a
King
of
Portugal
,
equally
glorious
and
costly
;
but
much
better
adapt
;
and
therefore
in
its
Propriety
easy
to
be
account
for
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
glory
for
the
Head
of
her
Ladiship
,
every
Ray
of
which
be
set
with
diamond
,
large
at
the
Bottom
,
and
gradually
lessen
to
the
very
extremity
of
every
Ray
.
<EOS>
each
Ray
may
be
about
half
a
Yard
Long
;
and
I
imagin'd
in
the
Whole
there
may
be
about
one
hundred
of
them
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
if
ever
her
ladiship
do
the
Offerer
the
Honour
to
put
it
on
,
I
will
though
a
Heretick
,
venture
to
aver
,
she
do
not
at
that
present
time
look
like
a
humane
Creature
.
  
<EOS>
to
enumerate
the
rest
,
if
my
memory
would
suffice
,
would
exceed
Belief
.
<EOS>
as
the
upper
Part
be
a
plain
miracle
of
Nature
,
the
low
be
a
compleat
Treasury
of
miraculous
art
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
ascend
from
the
low
cell
to
the
very
Summit
,
the
last
of
all
the
thirteen
,
you
will
perceive
a
continual
Contention
between
Pleasure
and
devotion
;
and
at
last
,
perhaps
,
find
your
self
at
a
loss
to
decide
which
deserve
the
Preheminence
:
for
you
be
not
here
to
take
cell
in
the
vulgar
Acceptation
,
as
the
little
dormitory
of
solitary
Monks
:
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
neatness
,
Use
,
and
Contrivance
appear
in
every
one
of
them
;
and
though
in
an
almost
perfect
equality
,
yet
in
such
Perfection
,
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
discover
in
any
one
of
them
any
thing
want
to
the
Pleasure
of
Life
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
descend
to
the
Convent
near
the
Foot
of
that
venerable
Hill
;
you
may
see
more
,
much
more
of
the
rich
of
the
world
;
but
less
,
far
less
appearance
of
a
celestial
treasure
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
it
may
be
only
the
Sentiment
of
a
heretick
;
but
that
Awe
and
Devotion
,
which
I
find
in
my
Attendant
from
Cell
to
Cell
grow
languid
,
and
lose
in
meer
empty
Bigotry
and
foggy
superstition
,
when
I
come
below
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
there
be
not
a
great
difference
in
their
height
,
than
in
the
sentiment
<EOS>
they
inspir'd
<EOS>
me
with
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
leave
this
Emblem
of
the
beatific
Vision
,
I
must
correct
some
thing
like
a
Mistake
,
as
to
the
poor
Borigo
.
<EOS>
I
say
at
the
beginning
that
his
labour
be
daily
;
but
the
Sunday
be
to
him
a
day
of
rest
,
as
it
be
to
the
Hermits
,
his
Masters
,
a
day
of
Refection
.
<EOS>
for
to
save
the
poor
faithful
Brute
the
hard
Drudgery
of
that
day
,
the
thirteen
Hermits
,
if
Health
permit
,
descend
to
their
Canobium
,
as
they
call
it
;
that
is
,
to
the
Hall
of
the
Convent
;
where
they
dine
in
common
with
the
Monks
of
the
order
,
who
be
Benedictines
.
  
<EOS>
after
seven
day
variety
of
such
innocent
Delight
(
the
Space
allow'd
for
the
Entertainment
of
Strangers
)
,
I
take
my
leave
of
this
pacifick
Hermitage
,
to
pursue
the
more
boisterous
duty
of
my
calling
.
<EOS>
the
Life
of
a
soldier
be
in
every
respect
the
full
antithesis
to
that
of
a
Hermit
;
and
I
know
not
,
whether
it
may
not
be
a
sense
of
that
,
<EOS>
which
inspir'd
me
with
very
great
Reluctancy
at
parting
.
<EOS>
I
confess
,
while
on
the
Spot
,
I
over
and
over
bandy'd
<EOS>
in
my
mind
the
reason
which
may
prevail
upon
Charles
the
Fifth
to
relinquish
his
Crown
;
and
the
argument
on
his
side
never
fail'd
of
energy
,
I
could
persuade
my
self
that
this
,
or
some
like
happy
Retreat
,
be
the
reward
of
abdicate
Empire
.
  
<EOS>
full
of
these
contemplation
(
for
they
last
there
)
<EOS>
I
arriv'd
<EOS>
at
Barcelona
;
where
I
find
a
Vessel
ready
to
sail
,
on
which
I
embark
for
Denia
,
in
pursuance
of
my
order
.
<EOS>
sail
to
the
Mouth
of
the
Mediterranean
,
no
place
along
the
Christian
Shore
afford
a
Prospect
equally
delightful
with
the
Castle
of
Denia
.
<EOS>
It
be
never
design
for
a
place
of
great
strength
,
be
build
,
and
first
design'd
,
as
a
Seat
of
Pleasure
to
the
Great
Duke
of
Lerma
.
<EOS>
in
that
Family
it
many
year
remain'd
;
tho
'
,
within
less
than
a
Century
,
that
with
two
other
Dukedoms
,
have
devolv'd
upon
the
Family
of
the
Duke
de
Medina
Celi
,
the
rich
subject
at
this
time
in
all
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
DENIA
be
the
first
Town
,
that
in
our
way
to
Barcelona
,
declar'd
for
King
Charles
;
and
be
then
by
his
order
make
a
Garrison
.
<EOS>
the
Town
be
but
small
,
and
surround
with
a
thin
wall
;
so
thin
,
that
I
have
know
a
Cannon
-
Ball
pierce
through
it
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
arriv'd
at
Denia
,
I
find
a
Spaniard
Governor
of
the
Town
,
whose
Name
have
slipt
my
memory
;
tho
'
his
Behaviour
merit
everlasting
Annals
.
<EOS>
Major
Percival
,
an
Englishman
,
command
in
the
Castle
,
and
on
my
come
there
,
I
understand
,
it
have
be
agree
between
'em
,
that
in
case
of
a
Siege
,
which
they
apprehend
,
the
Town
should
be
defend
wholly
by
Spaniards
,
and
the
Castle
by
the
English
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
scarce
be
there
three
week
before
those
expectation
be
answer
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
invest
by
Count
D'Alfelt
,
and
Major
General
Mahoni
;
two
day
after
which
,
they
open'd
<EOS>
trench
on
the
East
Side
of
the
Town
.
<EOS>
I
be
necessitate
upon
their
so
do
,
to
order
the
Demolishment
of
some
Houses
on
that
side
,
that
I
may
erect
a
Battery
to
point
upon
their
trench
,
the
well
to
annoy
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
;
and
it
do
the
intended
Service
;
for
with
that
,
and
two
other
,
which
I
rais'd
upon
the
Castle
(
from
all
which
we
fir'd
incessantly
,
and
with
great
Success
)
<EOS>
the
besieger
be
sufficiently
incommode
.
  
<EOS>
the
Governor
of
the
Town
(
a
Spaniard
as
I
say
before
,
and
with
a
spanish
Garrison
)
<EOS>
behav'd
very
gallantly
;
insomuch
,
that
what
be
say
of
the
Prince
of
Hesse
,
when
he
so
bravely
defend
Gibraltar
against
the
joint
force
of
France
and
Spain
,
may
be
say
of
him
,
that
he
be
Governor
,
Engineer
,
Gunner
,
and
Bombardier
all
in
one
;
for
no
man
could
exceed
him
,
either
in
Conduct
or
courage
;
nor
be
the
Spaniards
under
him
less
valiant
or
vigilant
;
for
in
case
the
place
be
take
,
expecting
but
<EOS>
indifferent
Quarter
,
they
fight
with
Bravery
,
and
defend
the
place
to
Admiration
.
  
<EOS>
the
Enemy
have
answer'd
our
fire
with
all
the
Ardour
imaginable
;
and
have
make
a
Breach
,
that
,
as
we
think
be
practicable
,
a
storm
be
expect
every
hour
.
<EOS>
prepare
against
which
to
the
great
joy
of
all
the
inhabitant
,
and
the
Surprize
of
the
whole
Garrison
,
and
without
our
be
able
to
assign
the
least
cause
,
the
Enemy
suddenly
raise
the
Siege
,
and
withdraw
from
a
Place
,
which
those
within
imagine
in
great
Danger
.
  
<EOS>
the
Siege
thus
abdicate
(
if
I
may
use
a
modern
phrase
)
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
to
improve
my
time
,
and
make
the
good
provision
I
could
against
any
future
attack
.
<EOS>
to
that
purpose
I
make
several
new
Fortifications
,
together
with
proper
casemet
for
our
Powder
,
all
which
render'd
<EOS>
the
Place
much
strong
<EOS>
,
tho
'
Time
too
soon
show'd
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
that
Strength
it
self
must
yield
to
Fortune
.
  
<EOS>
survey
those
work
,
and
my
Workmen
<EOS>
,
I
be
one
day
stand
on
the
great
Battery
,
<EOS>
when
cast
my
eye
toward
the
Barbary
Coast
,
I
observ'd
an
odd
sort
of
greenish
Cloud
make
to
the
Spanish
Shoar
.
<EOS>
not
like
other
Clouds
with
Rapidity
or
Swiftness
,
but
with
a
motion
so
slow
,
that
Sight
itself
be
a
long
time
before
it
would
allow
it
such
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
it
come
just
over
my
Head
,
and
interpose
between
the
Sun
and
me
,
so
thicken
the
air
,
that
I
have
lose
the
very
Sight
of
Day
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
it
have
reach'd
<EOS>
the
land
;
and
tho
'
very
near
me
in
my
imagination
<EOS>
,
it
begin
to
dissolve
,
and
lose
of
its
first
Tenebrity
,
when
all
on
a
sudden
there
fall
such
a
vast
multitude
of
locust
,
as
exceed
the
thick
storm
of
Hail
or
Snow
that
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
all
around
me
be
immediately
cover'd
with
those
craule
Creatures
;
and
they
yet
continu'd
to
fall
so
thick
,
that
with
the
swing
of
my
Cane
<EOS>
I
knock'd
down
thousand
.
<EOS>
It
be
scarce
imaginable
<EOS>
the
Havock
I
make
in
a
very
little
space
of
time
<EOS>
;
much
less
conceivable
be
the
horrid
Desolation
which
attend
the
visitation
of
those
Animalcula
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
in
a
day
or
two
's
time
,
the
least
leaf
to
be
see
upon
a
tree
,
nor
any
green
Thing
in
a
Garden
.
<EOS>
nature
seem'd
bury
in
her
own
Ruins
;
and
the
vegetable
world
to
be
supporter
only
to
her
Monument
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
the
hard
Winter
,
in
those
Parts
,
attend
with
any
equal
desolation
.
<EOS>
when
,
glutton
like
,
they
have
devour
all
that
should
have
sustain
them
,
and
the
more
valuable
part
of
God
's
Creation
(
whether
weary
with
gorging
,
or
over
thirsty
with
devour
,
I
leave
to
Philosophers
)
<EOS>
they
make
to
Ponds
,
Brooks
,
and
stand
pool
,
there
revenge
their
own
rape
upon
Nature
,
upon
their
own
vile
carkasse
.
<EOS>
in
every
of
these
you
may
see
them
lie
in
Heaps
like
little
Hills
;
drown'd
indeed
,
but
attend
with
stench
so
noisome
,
that
it
give
the
distracted
Neighbourhood
too
great
reason
to
apprehend
yet
more
fatal
consequence
.
<EOS>
a
pestilential
Infection
be
the
Dread
of
every
place
,
but
especially
of
all
part
upon
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
the
Priests
therefore
repair'd
to
a
little
Chapel
,
build
in
the
open
field
,
to
be
make
use
of
on
such
like
occasion
,
there
to
deprecate
the
miserable
cause
of
this
dreadful
visitation
.
<EOS>
in
a
Week
's
time
,
or
there
about
,
the
Stench
be
over
,
and
every
thing
but
verdant
nature
in
its
pristin
order
.
  
<EOS>
some
few
month
after
this
,
and
about
eight
month
from
the
former
Siege
,
Count
D'Alfelt
<EOS>
caus'd
Denia
to
be
again
invest
;
and
be
then
sensible
of
all
the
Mistakes
he
have
before
commit
,
he
now
go
about
his
Business
with
more
Regularity
and
Discretion
.
<EOS>
the
first
Thing
he
set
upon
,
and
it
be
the
wise
thing
he
could
do
,
be
to
cut
off
our
communication
with
the
Sea
.
<EOS>
this
he
do
,
and
thereby
obtain
what
he
much
desire
.
<EOS>
next
,
he
caus'd
<EOS>
his
battery
to
be
erect
on
the
west
side
of
the
Town
,
from
which
he
ply'd
it
so
furiously
,
that
in
five
day
'
time
a
practicable
Breach
be
make
;
upon
which
they
storm
and
take
it
.
<EOS>
the
Governor
,
who
have
so
bravely
defend
it
in
the
former
Seige
,
fortunately
for
him
have
be
remov'd
;
and
Francis
Valero
,
now
in
his
Place
,
be
make
Prisoner
of
War
with
all
his
Garrison
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
take
the
Town
,
they
erect
battery
against
the
Castle
,
which
they
keep
ply'd
with
incessant
fire
,
both
from
Cannon
and
Mortars
.
<EOS>
but
what
most
of
all
plagu'd
us
,
and
do
us
most
Mischief
,
be
the
vast
shower
of
Stones
send
among
the
Garrison
from
their
mortar
.
<EOS>
these
,
terrible
in
Bulk
and
Size
,
do
more
execution
than
all
the
rest
put
together
.
<EOS>
the
Garrison
could
not
avoid
be
somewhat
disheartened
at
this
uncommon
way
of
Rencounter
;
yet
,
to
a
man
,
dedar'd
against
hearken
to
any
proposal
of
Surrender
,
the
Governor
except
;
who
have
select
more
treasure
than
he
could
properly
,
or
justly
call
his
own
,
be
the
only
person
that
seem'd
forward
for
such
a
Motion
.
<EOS>
He
have
more
than
once
throw
out
expression
of
such
a
Nature
,
but
without
any
effect
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
have
at
last
secretly
obtain
a
peculiar
capitulation
for
himself
,
Bag
,
and
Baggage
;
the
Garrison
be
sacrific'd
to
his
private
interest
,
and
basely
give
up
prisoner
of
War
.
<EOS>
by
these
Means
indeed
he
save
his
money
,
but
lose
his
reputation
;
and
soon
after
,
life
it
self
.
<EOS>
and
sure
every
body
will
allow
the
latter
loss
to
be
least
,
who
will
take
Pains
to
consider
,
that
it
screen
him
from
the
consequential
Scrutinies
of
a
Council
of
War
,
which
must
have
issue
as
the
just
reward
of
his
Demerits
.
  
<EOS>
the
Garrison
be
thus
unaccountably
deliver
up
and
make
prisoner
,
be
disperse
different
way
:
some
into
Castile
,
other
as
far
as
Oviedo
,
in
the
Kingdom
of
Leon
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
have
receive
a
contusion
in
my
breast
;
I
be
under
a
necessity
of
be
leave
behind
with
the
Enemy
,
till
I
should
be
in
a
condition
to
be
remov'd
,
and
<EOS>
when
that
time
come
,
I
find
my
self
agreeably
order
to
Valencia
.
  
<EOS>
as
Prisoner
of
War
I
must
now
bid
adieu
to
the
active
part
of
the
military
life
;
and
hereafter
concern
my
self
with
description
of
country
,
town
,
Palaces
,
and
Men
,
instead
of
Battles
.
<EOS>
however
,
if
I
take
in
my
way
action
of
War
,
found
on
the
good
authority
,
I
hope
my
intersperse
such
will
be
no
disadvantage
to
my
now
more
pacifick
MEMOIRS
.
  
<EOS>
so
soon
as
I
arriv'd
at
Valencia
,
I
write
to
our
pay
-
master
Mr.
Mead
,
at
Barcelona
,
let
him
know
,
that
I
be
become
a
Prisoner
,
wound
,
and
in
want
of
money
.
<EOS>
nor
could
even
all
those
circumstance
prevail
on
me
to
think
it
long
before
he
return
a
favourable
answer
,
in
an
order
to
Monsieur
Zoulicafre
,
a
Banker
,
to
pay
me
on
Sight
fifty
Pistoles
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
same
letter
he
give
me
to
understand
,
that
those
fifty
Pistoles
be
a
present
to
me
from
General
(
afterward
Earl
)
Stanhope
;
and
so
indeed
I
find
it
,
when
I
return'd
into
England
,
my
account
not
be
charge
with
any
part
of
it
:
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
only
test
I
receive
of
that
generous
Earl
's
Generosity
.
<EOS>
and
where
be
the
Wonder
,
as
the
World
be
compell'd
to
own
,
that
Heroick
Actions
and
Largeness
of
Soul
ever
do
discover
and
amply
distinguish
the
genuine
branch
of
that
illustrious
Family
.
  
<EOS>
this
recruit
to
me
however
be
the
more
generous
for
be
seasonable
.
<EOS>
benefit
be
always
double
in
their
be
easily
conferr'd
<EOS>
and
well
tim'd
;
and
with
such
an
Allowance
as
I
constantly
have
by
the
order
of
King
Philip
,
as
Prisoner
of
War
,
viz
.
<EOS>
eighteen
Ounces
of
Mutton
per
diem
for
my
self
,
and
nine
for
my
man
,
with
Bread
and
Wine
in
proportion
,
and
especially
in
such
a
situation
;
all
this
I
say
be
sufficient
to
invite
a
man
to
be
easy
,
and
almost
forget
his
want
of
Liberty
,
and
much
more
so
to
me
if
it
be
consider'd
,
that
,
that
want
of
Liberty
consist
only
in
be
debarr'd
from
leave
the
pleasantest
City
in
all
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
meet
with
the
French
Engineer
,
who
make
the
Mine
under
the
Rock
of
the
Castle
at
Alicant
.
<EOS>
that
fatal
Mine
,
which
blow
up
General
Richards
,
Colonel
Syburg
,
Colonel
Thornicroft
,
and
at
least
twenty
more
officer
.
<EOS>
and
yet
by
the
Account
,
that
Engineer
give
me
,
their
Fate
be
their
own
choosing
:
<EOS>
the
General
,
who
command
at
that
Siege
be
more
industrious
to
save
them
,
than
they
be
to
be
say'd
:
<EOS>
He
endeavour'd
it
<EOS>
many
way
<EOS>
:
He
send
them
word
of
the
Mine
,
and
their
readiness
to
spring
it
;
he
over
and
over
send
them
offer
of
leave
to
come
,
and
take
a
view
of
it
,
and
inspect
it
:
notwithstanding
all
which
,
tho
'
Colonel
Thornicroft
,
and
Captain
Page
,
a
French
Engineer
,
in
the
Service
of
King
Charles
,
pursue
the
invitation
,
and
be
permit
to
view
it
,
yet
would
they
not
believe
;
but
report
on
their
Return
,
that
it
be
a
sham
Mine
,
a
feint
only
to
intimidate
'em
to
a
surrender
,
all
the
Bags
be
fill'd
with
Sand
instead
of
Gun
-
powder
.
  
<EOS>
the
very
day
on
which
the
Besiegers
design'd
to
spring
the
Mine
,
they
give
Notice
of
it
;
and
the
People
of
the
Neighbourhood
run
up
in
crowd
to
an
opposite
Hill
in
order
to
see
it
:
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
altho
'
those
in
the
Castle
see
all
this
,
they
still
remain'd
<EOS>
so
infatuated
,
as
to
imagine
it
all
do
only
to
affright
'em
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
fatal
Mine
be
spring
,
and
all
who
be
upon
that
Battery
lose
their
life
;
and
among
them
those
I
first
mention
.
<EOS>
the
very
recital
hereof
make
me
think
within
my
self
,
who
can
resist
his
Fate
?
  
<EOS>
that
Engineer
add
further
,
that
it
be
with
an
incredible
difficulty
,
that
he
prepar'd
<EOS>
that
mine
;
that
there
be
in
the
Concavity
thirteen
hundred
Barrels
of
Powder
;
notwithstanding
which
,
it
make
no
great
noise
without
,
whatever
it
may
do
inwardly
;
that
only
take
away
what
may
be
not
improperly
term'd
<EOS>
an
Excrescence
in
the
Rock
,
the
heave
on
the
blast
have
render'd
<EOS>
the
Castle
rather
strong
on
that
side
than
it
be
before
,
a
Crevice
or
Crack
which
have
often
occasion
apprehension
be
thereby
wholly
clos'd
and
firm
.
  
<EOS>
some
further
Particulars
I
soon
after
have
from
Colonel
Syburg
's
Gentleman
;
who
see
me
at
the
Play
-
house
,
challenge
me
,
tho
'
at
that
Time
unkown
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
that
the
Night
preceede
the
unfortunate
Catastrophe
of
his
Master
,
he
be
wait
on
him
in
the
Casemet
,
where
he
observe
,
sometime
before
the
rest
of
the
Company
take
notice
of
it
,
that
General
Richards
appear
very
pensive
and
thoughtful
,
that
the
whole
Night
long
he
be
pester'd
with
,
and
could
not
get
rid
of
a
great
Flie
,
which
be
perpetually
buzz
about
his
Ears
and
Head
,
to
the
vexation
and
disturbance
of
the
rest
of
the
company
,
as
well
as
the
General
himself
;
that
in
the
morning
,
when
they
go
upon
the
Battery
,
under
which
the
Mine
be
,
the
General
make
many
offer
of
go
off
;
but
Colonel
Syburg
,
who
be
get
a
little
merry
,
and
the
rest
out
of
a
Bravado
,
would
stay
,
and
would
not
let
the
General
stir
;
that
at
last
it
be
propos'd
by
Colonel
Syburg
to
have
the
other
two
bottle
to
the
Queen
's
Health
,
after
which
he
promise
they
would
all
go
off
together
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
my
relator
,
Syburg
's
Gentleman
,
say
,
he
be
send
to
fetch
the
stipulate
two
Bottles
;
return
with
which
,
Captain
Daniel
Weaver
,
within
thirty
or
forty
yard
of
the
Battery
,
run
by
him
,
vow
,
he
be
resolv'd
to
drink
the
Queen
's
Health
with
them
;
but
his
foot
be
scarce
on
the
Battery
,
when
the
Mine
be
spring
,
which
take
him
away
with
the
rest
of
the
company
;
while
Major
Harding
now
a
justice
in
Westminster
come
that
very
Moment
off
Duty
,
exchang'd
fate
.
  
<EOS>
if
Predestination
,
in
the
eye
of
many
,
be
an
unaccountable
doctrine
,
what
well
Account
can
the
wise
give
of
this
fatality
?
<EOS>
or
to
what
else
shall
we
impute
the
issue
of
this
whole
Transaction
?
<EOS>
that
man
shall
be
solicit
to
their
safety
;
suffer
to
survey
the
Danger
they
be
threaten
with
;
among
many
other
token
of
its
approach
Certainty
,
see
such
a
concourse
of
People
crowd
to
be
spectator
of
their
impending
Catastrophe
;
and
after
all
this
,
so
infatuated
to
stay
on
the
fatal
Spot
<EOS>
the
fetching
up
of
the
other
two
bottle
;
whatever
it
may
to
such
as
never
think
,
to
such
as
plead
an
use
of
reason
,
it
must
administer
Matter
worthy
of
the
sedate
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
be
now
pretty
well
recover'd
of
my
Wounds
,
I
be
by
order
of
the
Governor
of
Valencia
,
remove
to
Sainte
Clemente
de
la
Mancha
,
a
Town
somewhat
more
inland
,
and
consequently
esteem'd
more
secure
than
a
Semi
-
Seaport
.
<EOS>
here
I
remain'd
under
a
sort
of
pilgrimage
upwards
of
three
year
.
<EOS>
to
me
as
a
Stranger
divest
of
Acquaintance
or
Friend
(
for
at
that
instant
<EOS>
I
be
sole
Prisoner
there
)
at
first
it
<EOS>
appear'd
<EOS>
such
,
tho
'
in
a
very
small
compass
of
Time
,
I
luckily
find
it
make
quite
otherwise
by
an
agreeable
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
SAINTE
Clemente
de
la
Mancha
,
be
render
famous
by
the
renown'd
Don
Michael
Cerviantes
,
who
in
his
facetious
but
satyrical
romance
,
have
fix'd
it
<EOS>
the
Seat
and
Birth
Place
of
his
Hero
Don
Quixot
.
  
<EOS>
the
Gentlemen
of
this
place
be
the
least
priest
-
ride
or
Sons
of
Bigotry
,
of
any
that
I
meet
with
in
all
Spain
;
of
which
in
my
conversation
with
them
<EOS>
I
have
daily
instance
.
<EOS>
among
many
other
,
an
expression
that
fall
from
Don
Felix
Pacheco
,
a
Gentleman
of
the
good
figure
thereabout
,
and
of
a
very
plentiful
Fortune
,
shall
now
suffice
.
<EOS>
I
be
become
very
intimate
with
him
;
and
we
us'd
often
to
converse
together
with
a
Freedom
too
dangerous
to
be
common
in
a
country
so
enslav'd
by
the
Inquisition
.
<EOS>
ask
me
one
day
in
a
sort
of
a
jocose
manner
,
who
,
in
my
opinion
,
have
do
the
great
miracle
that
ever
be
hear
of
?
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
answer'd
,
Jesus
Christ
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
true
,
"
say
he
,
"
Jesus
Christ
do
great
miracle
,
and
a
great
one
it
be
to
feed
five
thousand
People
with
two
or
three
small
fish
,
and
a
like
number
of
loaf
:
<EOS>
but
Saint
Francis
,
the
founder
of
the
Franciscan
Order
,
have
find
out
a
way
to
feed
daily
one
hundred
thousand
Lubbards
with
nothing
at
all
"
;
mean
the
Franciscans
,
the
follower
of
Saint
Francis
,
who
have
no
visible
revenue
;
yet
in
their
way
of
live
come
up
to
,
if
they
do
not
exceed
any
other
order
.
  
<EOS>
another
day
talking
of
the
Place
,
it
naturally
lead
us
into
a
discourse
of
the
Knight
of
la
Mancha
,
Don
Quixot
.
<EOS>
at
which
time
he
tell
me
,
that
in
his
opinion
,
that
work
be
a
perfect
Paradox
,
be
the
good
and
the
bad
romance
,
that
ever
be
write
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
tho
'
<EOS>
it
must
infallibly
please
every
man
,
that
have
any
taste
of
Wit
;
yet
have
it
have
such
a
fatal
effect
upon
the
spirit
of
my
countryman
,
that
every
Man
of
Wit
must
ever
resent
;
for
,
"
continu'd
<EOS>
he
,
"
before
the
appearance
in
the
World
of
that
Labour
of
Cerviantes
,
it
be
next
to
an
impossibility
for
a
man
to
walk
the
Streets
with
any
Delight
,
or
without
Danger
.
<EOS>
there
be
see
so
many
Cavaliero
's
prancing
and
curvet
before
the
window
of
their
mistress
,
that
a
Stranger
would
have
imagin'd
<EOS>
the
whole
nation
to
have
be
nothing
less
than
a
race
of
Knight
Errants
.
<EOS>
but
after
the
World
become
a
little
acquaint
with
that
notable
history
;
the
man
that
be
see
in
that
once
celebrate
Drapery
,
be
point
at
as
a
Don
Quixot
,
and
find
himself
the
Jest
of
High
and
low
.
<EOS>
and
I
verily
believe
,
"
add
he
,
"
that
to
this
,
and
this
only
we
owe
that
dampness
and
poverty
of
Spirit
,
which
have
run
thro
'
all
our
council
for
a
Century
past
,
so
little
agreeable
to
those
noble
action
of
our
famous
ancestor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
many
of
these
less
sort
of
Confidences
,
Don
Felix
recommend
me
to
a
Lodging
next
Door
to
his
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
a
Widow
's
,
who
have
one
only
Daughter
,
her
House
just
opposite
to
a
Francisan
Nunnery
.
<EOS>
here
I
remain'd
somewhat
upwards
of
two
year
;
all
which
time
,
lie
in
my
Bed
,
I
could
hear
the
Nuns
early
in
the
morning
at
their
matin
,
and
late
in
the
evening
at
their
vesper
,
with
Delight
enough
to
my
self
,
and
without
the
least
indecency
in
the
World
in
my
thought
of
them
.
<EOS>
Their
own
Divine
Employ
too
much
<EOS>
employ'd
<EOS>
every
Faculty
of
mine
to
entertain
any
Thing
inconsentaneous
or
offensive
.
  
<EOS>
this
my
neighbourhood
to
the
Nunnery
give
me
an
opportunity
of
see
two
nun
invest
;
and
in
this
I
must
do
a
justice
to
the
whole
Country
,
to
acknowledge
,
that
a
Stranger
who
be
curious
(
I
would
impute
it
rather
to
their
hope
of
Conversion
,
than
to
their
vanity
)
<EOS>
shall
be
admit
to
much
great
freedom
in
their
religious
Pageantries
,
than
any
Native
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
these
Nuns
be
of
the
first
Quality
,
which
render'd
the
Ceremony
more
remarkably
fine
.
<EOS>
the
manner
of
invest
them
be
thus
:
in
the
morning
her
Relations
and
Friends
all
meet
at
her
Father
's
House
;
<EOS>
whence
,
she
be
attir'd
<EOS>
in
her
most
sumptuous
apparel
,
and
a
Coronet
plac'd
on
her
Head
,
they
attend
her
,
in
Cavalcade
,
to
the
Nunnery
,
the
Streets
and
Windows
be
crowd
,
and
fill'd
with
spectator
of
all
sort
.
  
<EOS>
so
soon
as
she
enter'd
<EOS>
the
Chapel
belong
to
the
Nunnery
,
she
kneel'd
down
,
and
with
an
appearance
of
much
Devotion
,
salute
the
ground
;
then
rise
up
,
she
advance
a
step
or
two
farther
,
when
on
her
Knees
she
repeat
the
Salutes
:
<EOS>
this
do
she
approach
to
the
Altar
,
where
she
remain
till
Mass
be
over
:
after
which
,
a
Sermon
be
preach'd
by
one
of
the
Priests
in
Praise
,
or
rather
in
an
exalted
preference
of
a
single
life
.
<EOS>
the
Sermon
be
over
,
the
Nun
elect
fall
down
on
her
Knees
before
the
altar
;
and
after
some
short
mental
Oraisons
,
rise
again
,
she
withdraw
into
an
inner
Room
,
where
strip
off
all
her
rich
Attire
,
she
put
on
her
Nun
's
weed
:
in
which
make
her
appearance
,
she
,
again
kneel
,
offer'd
up
some
private
Devotions
;
which
be
over
,
she
be
lead
to
the
Door
of
the
Nunnery
,
where
the
Lady
and
the
rest
of
the
Nuns
stand
ready
to
receive
her
with
open
arm
.
<EOS>
thus
enter'd
,
the
Nuns
conduct
her
into
the
Quire
,
where
after
they
have
entertain
her
with
singing
,
and
play
upon
the
Organ
,
the
Ceremony
conclude
,
and
every
one
depart
to
their
proper
habitation
.
  
<EOS>
the
very
same
day
of
the
Year
ensue
the
Relations
and
Friends
of
the
fair
Novitiate
meet
again
in
the
Chapel
of
the
Nunnery
,
where
the
Lady
Abbess
bring
her
out
,
and
deliver
her
to
them
.
<EOS>
then
again
be
there
a
Sermon
preach'd
on
the
same
subject
as
at
first
;
which
be
over
,
she
be
bring
up
to
the
Altar
,
in
a
decent
,
but
plain
Dress
,
the
fine
apparel
,
which
she
put
off
on
her
initiation
,
be
deposit
on
one
side
of
the
Altar
,
and
her
Nun
's
weed
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
here
the
priest
in
latin
cry
,
Utrum
horum
mavis
,
accipe
:
to
which
she
answer
,
as
her
Inclination
,
or
as
her
instruction
direct
her
.
<EOS>
if
she
,
after
this
her
Year
of
Probation
,
show
any
Dislike
,
she
be
at
Liberty
to
come
again
into
the
world
:
<EOS>
but
if
aw'd
by
Fear
(
as
too
often
be
the
Case
)
or
win
by
expectation
,
or
present
real
inclination
,
she
make
choice
of
the
Nun
's
weed
,
she
be
immediately
invest
,
and
must
never
expect
to
appear
again
in
the
World
out
of
the
wall
of
the
Nunnery
.
<EOS>
the
young
Lady
I
thus
see
invest
be
very
beautiful
,
and
sing
the
good
of
any
in
the
Nunnery
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
in
the
Town
three
Nunneries
,
and
a
Convent
to
every
one
of
them
;
viz

<EOS>
one
of
Jesuits
,
one
of
Carmelites
,
and
the
other
of
Franciscans
.
<EOS>
let
me
not
be
so
far
mistaken
to
have
this
take
by
way
of
Reflection
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
whatever
some
of
our
rake
of
the
Town
may
assert
,
I
freely
declare
,
that
I
never
see
in
any
of
the
Nunneries
(
of
which
I
have
see
many
both
in
Spain
and
other
Parts
of
the
World
)
<EOS>
any
thing
like
indecent
Behaviour
,
that
may
give
occasion
for
Satyr
or
Disesteem
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
there
may
be
Accidents
,
that
may
lead
to
a
misinterpretation
,
of
which
I
remember
a
very
untoward
instance
in
Alicant
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
English
Forces
first
lay
Siege
to
that
Town
,
the
Priests
,
who
be
apprehensive
of
it
,
have
be
long
since
make
sensible
of
the
profound
Regard
to
Chastity
and
Modesty
of
us
Hereticks
,
by
the
ignominious
Behaviour
of
certain
officer
at
Rota
and
Porta
St.
Maria
,
the
priest
,
I
say
,
have
take
care
to
send
away
privately
all
the
Nuns
to
Majorca
.
<EOS>
but
that
the
Heretick
Invaders
may
have
no
jealousy
of
it
,
the
fair
Curtezans
of
the
Town
be
admit
to
supply
their
Room
.
<EOS>
the
officer
,
both
of
Land
and
Sea
,
as
be
by
the
friar
pre
-
imagin'd
,
on
take
the
Town
and
Castle
,
immediately
repair'd
to
the
Grates
of
the
Nunnery
,
toss'd
over
their
Handkercheifs
,
Nosegays
,
and
other
pretty
Things
;
all
which
be
,
doubtless
,
very
graciously
receive
by
those
imaginary
Recluses
.
<EOS>
Thence
come
it
to
pass
,
that
in
the
space
of
a
Month
or
less
,
you
could
hardly
fall
into
Comany
of
any
one
of
our
young
officer
,
of
either
sort
,
but
the
discourse
,
if
it
may
deserve
the
name
,
be
concern
these
beautiful
Nuns
;
and
you
wou'd
have
imagin'd
<EOS>
the
Price
of
these
lady
as
well
know
as
that
of
Flesh
in
their
common
market
.
<EOS>
other
,
as
well
as
my
self
,
have
often
endeavour'd
to
disabuse
those
Glorioso
's
,
but
all
to
little
purpose
,
till
more
sensible
token
convince
them
,
that
the
Nuns
,
of
whose
Favours
they
so
much
boasted
,
could
hardly
be
perfect
Virgins
,
tho
'
in
a
Cloyster
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
apt
to
think
,
those
who
would
palm
upon
the
World
like
vicious
relation
of
Nuns
and
Nunneries
,
do
it
on
much
like
ground
.
<EOS>
not
that
there
be
want
instance
of
Nunneries
disfranchis'd
,
and
even
demolish'd
,
upon
very
flagrant
account
;
but
I
confine
myself
to
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
Town
of
la
Mancha
the
Corrigidore
always
have
his
Presidence
,
have
sixteen
other
under
his
jurisdiction
,
of
which
Almanza
be
one
.
<EOS>
They
be
change
every
three
year
,
and
their
office
be
the
Purchase
of
an
excessive
price
;
which
occasion
the
poor
People
's
be
extravagantly
fleece
,
<EOS>
nothing
be
to
be
sell
but
at
the
Rates
they
impose
;
and
every
thing
that
be
sell
pay
the
Corrigidore
an
Acknowledgment
in
specie
,
or
an
Equivalent
to
his
liking
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
here
,
News
come
of
the
Battle
of
Almanar
and
Saragosa
;
and
give
the
victory
to
that
side
,
which
they
espous'd
(
that
of
King
Philip
)
<EOS>
they
make
very
great
rejoycing
.
<EOS>
but
soon
,
alas
,
for
them
,
be
all
that
Joy
convert
into
sorrow
:
<EOS>
the
next
Courier
evincing
,
that
the
Forces
of
King
Charles
have
be
victorious
in
both
Engagements
.
<EOS>
this
do
not
turn
to
my
present
disadvantage
:
for
Convents
and
Nunneries
,
as
well
as
some
of
those
don
,
whom
afore
I
have
not
stand
so
well
with
,
strove
now
how
most
to
oblige
me
;
not
doubt
,
but
if
the
victorious
Army
should
march
that
way
,
it
may
be
in
my
Power
to
double
the
most
signal
of
their
service
in
my
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
an
accident
fall
out
,
which
have
like
to
have
be
of
an
unhappy
Consequence
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
stand
in
Company
,
upon
the
Parade
,
when
a
most
surprizing
flock
of
Eagles
fly
over
our
head
,
where
they
hover'd
for
a
considerable
time
.
<EOS>
the
Novelty
strike
them
all
with
Admiration
,
as
well
as
my
self
.
<EOS>
but
I
,
less
accustomed
to
like
spectacle
,
innocent
saying
,
that
in
my
opinion
,
it
could
not
bode
any
good
to
King
Philip
,
because
the
Eagle
compos'd
the
Arms
of
Austria
;
some
busie
body
,
in
hearing
,
go
and
inform'd
<EOS>
the
Corrigidore
of
it
.
<EOS>
those
most
magisterial
wretch
embrace
all
occasion
of
squeeze
money
;
and
more
especially
from
stranger
.
<EOS>
however
find
his
expectation
disappoint
in
me
,
and
that
I
too
well
know
the
length
of
his
Foot
,
to
let
my
money
run
freely
;
he
send
me
next
day
to
Alercon
;
but
the
Governor
of
that
place
have
have
before
Intelligence
,
that
the
English
Army
be
advance
that
way
,
refus'd
to
receive
me
,
so
I
return'd
as
I
go
;
only
the
gentleman
of
the
Place
,
as
they
have
condol'd
<EOS>
the
first
,
congratulate
the
last
;
for
that
Corrigidore
stand
but
very
indifferently
in
their
affection
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
a
warning
to
me
ever
after
,
how
I
make
use
of
English
Freedom
in
a
spanish
Territory
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
attain'd
the
Acquaintance
of
most
of
the
Clergy
,
and
religious
of
the
place
;
so
particularly
I
have
my
aim
in
obtain
that
of
the
Provincial
of
the
Carmelites
.
<EOS>
His
Convent
,
tho
'
small
,
be
exceed
neat
;
but
what
to
me
be
much
more
agreeable
,
there
be
very
large
Gardens
belong
to
it
,
which
often
furnish
me
with
Sallading
and
Fruit
,
and
much
oftner
with
Walks
of
Refreshment
,
the
most
satisfactory
amusement
in
this
warm
Climate
.
<EOS>
this
acquaintance
with
the
provincial
be
by
a
little
Incident
soon
advance
into
a
friendship
;
which
be
thus
:
<EOS>
I
be
one
day
walking
,
as
I
us'd
to
do
,
in
the
long
Gallery
of
the
Convent
,
when
observe
the
Images
of
the
Virgin
Mary
,
of
which
there
be
one
at
each
end
;
I
take
notice
that
one
have
an
Inscription
under
it
,
which
be
this
,
Ecce
,
Virgo
peperit
filium
:
but
the
other
have
no
inscription
at
all
;
upon
which
,
I
take
out
my
Pencil
,
and
write
underneath
,
this
line
:
  
Sponsa
Dei
,
patrisque
parens
,
&
filia
filii
.
  
<EOS>
the
Friars
,
who
at
a
little
distance
have
observe
me
,
as
soon
as
I
be
go
,
come
up
and
read
what
I
have
writ
;
report
which
to
the
Provincial
,
he
order'd
them
to
be
writ
over
in
letter
of
Gold
,
and
plac'd
just
as
I
have
put
'em
;
say
,
doubtless
,
such
a
fine
line
you
would
proceed
from
nothing
less
than
inspiration
.
<EOS>
this
secur'd
<EOS>
me
ever
after
his
and
their
esteem
;
the
least
advantage
of
which
,
be
a
full
Liberty
of
their
Garden
for
all
manner
of
Fruit
,
Sallading
,
or
whatever
I
please
:
<EOS>
and
as
I
say
before
,
the
Gardens
be
too
fine
not
to
render
such
a
Freedom
acceptable
.
  
<EOS>
They
often
want
rain
in
this
country
:
to
supply
the
defect
of
which
,
I
observe
in
this
Garden
,
as
well
as
other
,
an
invention
not
unuseful
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
well
in
the
middle
of
the
Garden
,
and
over
that
a
wheel
with
many
Pitchers
,
or
Buckets
,
one
under
another
,
which
Wheel
be
turn
round
by
an
Ass
,
the
Pitchers
scoop
up
the
Water
on
one
side
,
and
throw
it
out
on
the
other
into
a
Trough
,
that
by
little
channel
convey
it
,
as
the
Gardiner
direct
,
into
every
part
of
the
Garden
.
<EOS>
by
this
mean
their
flower
and
their
sallading
be
continually
refresh'd
,
and
preserve
from
the
otherwise
over
-
parch
Beams
of
the
Sun
.
  
<EOS>
the
Inquisition
,
in
almost
every
Town
in
Spain
(
and
more
especially
,
if
of
any
great
Account
)
have
its
spy
,
or
Informers
,
for
treacherous
Intelligence
.
<EOS>
these
make
it
their
business
to
ensnare
the
simple
and
unguarded
;
and
be
more
to
be
avoid
by
the
Stranger
,
than
the
Rattle
Snake
.
<EOS>
nature
have
appoint
no
such
happy
token
in
the
former
to
foreshew
the
Danger
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
believe
,
that
one
of
those
Vermin
once
make
his
attack
upon
me
in
this
place
:
<EOS>
and
as
they
be
very
rarely
,
if
ever
know
to
the
Natives
themselves
,
I
be
a
Stranger
,
may
be
allow
to
make
a
guess
by
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
walk
by
my
self
,
when
a
person
,
wholly
unknown
to
me
,
give
me
the
civil
Salute
of
the
day
,
endeavour'd
to
draw
me
into
Conversation
.
<EOS>
after
question
have
pass
on
general
head
,
the
fellow
ensnaringly
ask
me
,
how
it
come
to
pass
,
that
<EOS>
I
show'd
<EOS>
so
little
respect
to
the
image
of
the
crucify'd
Jesus
,
as
I
pass'd
<EOS>
by
it
in
such
a
Street
,
name
it
?
<EOS>
I
make
Answer
,
that
I
have
,
or
ought
to
have
him
always
in
my
heart
crucify
.
<EOS>
to
that
he
make
no
reply
:
but
proceed
in
his
Interrogatories
,
question'd
me
next
,
whether
I
believ'd
a
Purgatory
?
<EOS>
I
evade
the
Question
,
as
I
take
it
to
be
ensnare
;
and
only
tell
him
,
that
I
should
be
willing
to
hear
him
offer
any
thing
that
may
convince
me
of
the
truth
,
or
probability
of
it
.
<EOS>
truth
?
<EOS>
He
reply'd
in
a
Heat
<EOS>
:
there
never
yet
be
Man
<EOS>
so
Holy
as
to
enter
Heaven
without
first
pass
through
Purgatory
.
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
say
I
,
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
convince
a
reasonable
man
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
what
mean
you
by
that
,
cry'd
the
Spy
?
<EOS>
I
mean
,
say
I
,
that
I
can
name
one
,
and
a
great
Sinner
too
,
who
go
into
Bliss
without
any
visit
to
Purgatory
.
<EOS>
name
him
,
if
you
can
,
reply'd
<EOS>
my
querist
.
<EOS>
what
think
you
of
the
thief
upon
the
Cross
,
say
I
?
<EOS>
to
whom
our
die
Saviour
say
,
Hodie
eris
mecum
in
Paradiso
.
<EOS>
at
which
be
silence
tho
'
not
convict
,
he
turn
from
me
in
a
violent
rage
,
and
leave
me
to
my
self
.
  
<EOS>
what
increas'd
my
first
Suspicion
of
him
be
,
that
a
very
short
time
after
,
my
friend
the
Provincial
send
to
speak
with
me
;
and
repeat
all
passage
between
the
holy
Spy
and
me
,
assur'd
<EOS>
me
that
he
have
be
forc'd
to
argue
in
my
favour
,
and
tell
him
that
I
have
say
nothing
but
<EOS>
well
:
for
say
he
,
all
ought
to
have
the
Holy
Jesus
crucify
in
their
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
nevertheless
,
"
continu'd
he
,
"
it
be
a
commendable
and
good
thing
to
have
him
represent
in
the
high
way
:
for
,
suppose
,
"
say
he
,
"
a
man
be
go
upon
some
base
or
profligate
Design
,
the
very
Sight
of
a
cruficie
Saviour
may
happen
to
subvert
his
resolution
,
and
deter
him
from
commit
Theft
,
murder
,
or
any
other
of
the
deadly
sin
.
"
<EOS>
and
thus
end
that
Conference
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
upon
some
other
occasional
Conversation
after
,
the
Provincial
tell
me
,
that
in
the
Carmelite
Nunnery
next
to
his
Convent
,
and
under
his
care
,
there
be
a
Nun
,
that
be
daughter
to
Don
Juan
of
Austria
;
if
so
,
her
Age
must
render
her
venerable
,
as
her
quality
.
  
<EOS>
take
notice
one
day
,
that
all
the
People
of
the
Place
fetch'd
<EOS>
their
water
from
a
well
without
the
Town
,
altho
'
they
have
many
seemingly
as
good
within
;
I
speak
to
Don
Felix
of
it
,
who
give
me
,
under
the
Seal
of
Secrecy
,
this
reason
for
it
:
  
<EOS>
"
when
the
Seat
of
the
War
,
"
say
he
,
"
lie
in
these
part
,
the
french
train
of
Artillery
be
commonly
quarter'd
<EOS>
in
this
place
;
the
Officers
and
Soldiers
of
which
be
so
very
rampant
and
rude
,
in
attempt
to
debauch
our
Women
,
that
there
be
not
a
well
within
the
Town
,
which
have
not
some
french
Mens
Bones
at
the
bottom
of
it
;
therefore
the
Natives
,
who
be
sensible
of
it
,
choose
rather
to
go
farther
a
field
.
"
  
<EOS>
by
this
<EOS>
well
there
run
a
little
Rivulet
,
which
give
head
to
that
famous
River
call'd
the
Guadiana
;
which
run
for
some
Leagues
under
Ground
,
afford
a
pretence
for
the
Natives
to
boast
of
a
Bridge
on
which
they
feed
many
thousand
of
Sheep
.
<EOS>
when
it
rise
again
,
it
be
a
fine
large
River
,
and
after
a
currency
of
many
Leagues
,
empty
it
self
into
the
Atlantick
Ocean
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
military
affair
,
Almanar
and
Saragosa
be
victory
so
compleat
,
that
no
Body
make
the
least
doubt
of
their
settle
the
Crown
of
Spain
upon
the
Head
of
Charles
the
Third
,
without
a
Rival
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
barely
the
opinion
of
his
Friends
,
but
his
very
Enemies
resign'd
<EOS>
all
Hope
or
Expectation
in
favour
of
King
Philip
.
<EOS>
the
Castilians
,
his
most
faithful
friend
,
entertain'd
no
other
imagination
;
for
after
they
have
advis'd
,
and
prevail'd
that
the
Queen
with
the
Prince
of
Asturias
should
be
send
to
Victoria
;
under
the
same
despondency
,
and
a
full
dispiritedness
,
they
give
him
so
little
Encouragement
to
stay
in
Madrid
,
that
he
immediately
quit
the
Place
,
with
a
resolution
to
retire
into
his
Grandfather
's
dominion
,
the
place
of
his
Nativity
.
  
<EOS>
in
his
way
to
which
,
even
on
the
last
day
's
Journey
,
it
be
his
great
good
Fortune
to
meet
the
Duke
of
Vendome
,
with
some
few
troop
,
which
his
Grandfather
Lewis
XIV
.
<EOS>
of
France
have
order'd
to
his
Succour
,
under
that
Duke
's
Command
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
be
grievously
affect
at
such
an
unexpected
Catastrophe
;
nevertheless
,
he
leave
nothing
unsaid
or
undone
,
that
may
induce
that
Prince
to
turn
back
;
and
at
length
prevailing
,
after
a
little
rest
,
and
a
great
deal
of
Patience
,
by
the
Coming
in
of
his
scatter'd
troop
,
and
some
few
he
could
raise
,
together
with
those
the
Duke
bring
with
him
,
he
once
more
see
himself
at
the
Head
of
twenty
thousand
Men
.
  
<EOS>
while
thing
be
in
this
manner
,
under
Motion
in
King
Philip
's
Favour
,
Charles
the
third
,
with
his
victorious
Army
,
advance
forward
,
and
enter
into
Madrid
,
of
which
he
make
General
Stanhope
Governor
.
<EOS>
and
even
here
the
Castilians
give
full
Proof
of
their
Fidelity
to
their
Prince
;
even
at
the
Time
when
,
in
their
opinion
,
his
affair
be
past
all
hope
of
Retrieve
,
they
themselves
have
,
by
their
Advice
,
contribute
to
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
instead
of
prudential
acclamation
therefore
,
such
as
may
have
answer
the
Expectations
of
a
victorious
Prince
,
now
enter
into
their
capital
,
their
street
be
all
in
a
profound
Silence
,
their
balcony
unadorn'd
with
costly
Carpets
,
as
be
customary
on
like
occasion
;
and
scarce
an
inhabitant
to
be
see
in
either
Shop
or
Window
.
  
<EOS>
this
doubtless
be
no
little
mortification
to
a
conquer
Prince
;
however
his
general
be
wife
enough
to
keep
him
from
shew
any
other
Tokens
of
Resentment
,
than
march
through
the
City
with
Unconcern
,
and
take
up
his
Quarters
at
Villa
-
verda
,
about
a
League
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
King
Charles
visit
,
in
his
March
,
the
Chapel
of
the
Lady
de
Atocha
,
where
find
several
English
Colours
and
Standards
,
take
in
the
Battle
of
Almanza
<EOS>
,
there
hang
up
;
he
order
'em
to
be
take
down
,
and
restor'd
'em
to
the
English
General
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
current
opinion
then
,
and
almost
universal
Consent
have
since
confirm'd
<EOS>
it
,
that
the
false
step
in
that
whole
War
be
this
Advancement
of
King
Charles
to
Madrid
.
<EOS>
after
those
two
remarkable
victory
at
Almanar
and
Saragosa
,
have
he
direct
his
March
to
Pampeluna
,
and
<EOS>
obtain'd
Possession
of
that
place
,
or
some
other
near
it
,
he
have
not
only
stopt
all
Succours
from
come
out
of
France
,
but
he
would
,
in
a
great
measure
,
have
prevent
the
gathering
together
of
any
of
the
routed
and
dispers'd
force
of
King
Philip
:
<EOS>
and
it
be
the
general
Notion
of
the
Spaniards
,
I
convers'd
<EOS>
with
while
at
Madrid
,
that
have
King
Philip
once
again
set
his
Foot
upon
French
Land
,
Spain
would
never
have
be
bring
to
have
re
-
acknowledge
him
.
  
<EOS>
King
Charles
with
his
Army
have
<EOS>
stay'd
<EOS>
some
time
about
Madrid
,
and
see
his
expectation
of
the
Castilians
join
him
not
at
all
answer
,
at
last
resolve
to
decamp
,
and
return
to
Saragosa
:
accordingly
with
a
very
few
troop
that
Prince
advance
thither
;
while
the
main
body
,
under
the
Command
of
the
Generals
Stanhope
and
Staremberg
,
pass
under
the
very
Walls
of
Madrid
,
hold
on
their
March
towards
Aragon
.
  
<EOS>
after
about
three
day
'
March
,
General
Stanhope
take
up
his
Quarters
at
Breuhiga
,
a
small
Town
half
wall'd
;
General
Staremberg
march
three
league
farther
,
to
Cisuentes
.
<EOS>
this
choice
of
situation
of
the
two
several
army
not
a
little
puzzle
the
politician
of
those
time
,
who
could
very
indifferently
account
for
the
English
General
's
lie
<EOS>
expos'd
in
an
open
Town
,
with
his
few
English
Forces
,
of
which
General
Harvey
's
Regiment
of
fine
Horse
may
be
deem'd
the
main
;
and
General
Staremberg
encamp
three
league
farther
off
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
but
to
see
the
vicissitude
of
Fortune
,
to
which
the
Actions
of
the
brave
,
by
an
untoward
Sort
of
fatality
,
be
often
force
to
contribute
!
<EOS>
none
,
who
have
be
eye
-
witness
of
the
Bravery
of
either
of
those
general
at
the
Battles
of
Almanar
and
Saragosa
,
could
find
Room
to
call
in
question
either
their
conduct
or
their
courage
;
and
yet
in
this
March
,
and
this
Encampment
will
appear
a
visible
ill
Consequence
to
the
Affairs
of
the
interest
they
fight
for
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Vendome
have
increas'd
<EOS>
the
Forces
which
he
bring
from
France
,
to
upwards
of
twenty
thousand
Men
,
marche
by
Madrid
directly
for
Breuhiga
,
where
his
intelligence
inform'd
him
General
Stanhope
lie
,
and
that
so
secretly
as
well
as
swiftly
,
that
that
General
know
nothing
of
it
,
nor
could
be
persuade
to
believe
it
,
till
the
very
Moment
their
bullet
from
the
Enemy
's
Cannon
convinc'd
<EOS>
him
of
the
Truth
.
<EOS>
Breuhiga
,
I
have
say
,
be
wall'd
only
on
one
side
,
and
yet
on
that
very
side
the
Enemy
make
their
attack
.
<EOS>
but
what
could
a
Handful
do
against
a
Force
so
much
superior
,
though
they
have
not
be
in
want
of
both
Powder
and
Ball
;
and
in
want
of
these
be
forc'd
to
make
use
of
stone
against
all
Sorts
of
Ammunition
,
which
the
Enemy
ply'd
them
with
?
<EOS>
the
Consequence
answer
the
deficiency
;
they
be
all
make
Prisoners
of
War
,
and
Harvey
's
Regiment
of
Horse
among
the
rest
;
which
,
to
augment
their
calamity
,
be
immediately
remount
by
the
Enemy
,
and
march'd
along
with
their
Army
to
attack
General
Staremberg
.
  
<EOS>
that
General
have
hear
somewhat
of
the
March
of
Vendome
;
and
wait
with
some
impatience
to
have
the
confirmation
of
it
from
General
Stanhope
,
who
lie
between
,
and
whom
he
lie
under
an
Expectation
of
be
join
with
:
however
he
think
it
not
improper
to
make
some
little
advance
towards
him
;
and
accordingly
break
up
from
his
Camp
at
Cisuentes
,
he
come
back
to
Villa
viciosa
,
a
little
Town
between
Cisuentes
and
Breuhiga
;
there
he
find
Vendome
ready
to
attack
him
,
before
he
could
well
be
prepare
for
him
,
but
no
English
to
join
him
,
as
he
have
expect
;
nevertheless
,
the
Battle
be
hot
,
and
obstinately
fight
;
although
Staremberg
have
visibly
the
advantage
,
have
beat
the
Enemy
at
least
a
League
from
their
Cannon
;
at
which
Time
hearing
of
the
Misfortune
of
Breuhiga
,
and
find
himself
thereby
frustrated
of
those
expect
Succours
to
support
him
,
he
make
a
handsome
retreat
to
Barcelona
,
which
in
common
Calculation
be
about
one
hundred
Leagues
,
without
any
Disturbance
of
an
enemy
that
seem'd
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
his
Baggage
have
fall
into
the
Hands
of
the
Enemy
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
Fight
,
King
Philip
and
the
Duke
of
Vendome
generously
return
it
unopen'd
,
and
untouched
,
in
acknowledgement
of
his
brave
Behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
like
to
have
omit
one
material
passage
,
which
I
be
very
credibly
inform
of
;
that
General
Carpenter
offer
to
have
go
,
and
have
join'd
General
Staremberg
with
the
Horse
,
which
be
refus'd
him
.
<EOS>
this
be
certainly
an
Oversight
of
the
high
nature
;
since
his
go
would
have
strengthen'd
<EOS>
Staremberg
almost
to
the
Assurance
of
an
intire
victory
;
whereas
his
stay
be
of
no
manner
of
Service
,
but
quite
the
contrary
:
for
,
as
I
say
before
,
the
Enemy
,
by
re
-
mount
the
English
Horse
(
which
perhaps
be
the
compleatest
of
any
Regiment
in
the
World
)
turn'd
,
if
I
may
be
allow
the
expression
,
the
Strength
of
our
artillery
upon
our
Allies
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
retreat
of
Staremberg
,
and
the
Surprize
at
Breuhiga
,
there
be
great
rejoicing
at
Madrid
,
and
everywhere
else
,
where
King
Philip
's
interest
prevail
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
it
may
be
say
,
from
that
day
the
Interest
of
King
Charles
look'd
<EOS>
with
a
very
lowering
Aspect
.
<EOS>
I
be
still
a
prisoner
at
la
Mancha
,
when
this
news
arriv'd
;
and
very
sensibly
affect
at
that
strange
Turn
of
Fortune
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
bed
,
when
the
Express
pass'd
through
the
Town
,
in
order
to
convey
it
farther
;
and
in
the
middle
of
the
Night
I
hear
a
certain
Spanish
Don
,
with
whom
,
a
little
before
,
I
have
have
some
little
variance
,
thunder
at
my
Door
,
endeavour
to
burst
it
open
,
with
,
as
I
have
reason
to
suppose
,
no
very
favourable
design
upon
me
.
<EOS>
but
my
Landlady
,
who
hitherto
have
always
be
kind
and
careful
,
call
Don
Felix
,
and
some
other
of
my
Friends
together
,
sav'd
me
from
the
Fury
of
his
design
,
whatever
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
among
other
expression
of
the
general
Joy
upon
this
Occasion
,
there
be
a
Bull
-
Feast
at
la
Mancha
;
which
be
much
beyond
what
I
see
at
Valencia
,
I
shall
here
give
a
description
of
.
<EOS>
these
Bull
-
feast
be
not
so
common
now
in
Spain
as
formerly
,
King
Philip
not
take
much
Delight
in
them
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
as
soon
as
it
be
publish'd
here
,
that
there
be
to
be
one
,
no
other
Discourse
be
hear
;
and
in
the
talk
of
the
Bulls
,
and
the
great
Preparations
for
the
Feast
,
men
seem'd
to
have
lose
,
or
to
have
lay'd
aside
,
all
thought
of
the
very
Occasion
.
<EOS>
a
Week
's
time
be
allow'd
<EOS>
for
the
Building
of
Stalls
for
the
beast
,
and
scaffold
for
the
Spectators
;
and
other
necessary
preparation
for
the
setting
off
their
joy
with
the
most
suitable
Splendour
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
day
appoint
for
the
bringing
the
Bulls
into
Town
,
the
Cavalieroes
mount
their
horse
,
and
,
with
Spears
in
their
Hands
,
ride
out
of
Town
about
a
League
,
or
somewhat
more
to
meet
them
:
if
any
of
the
Bulls
break
from
the
Drove
,
and
make
an
excursion
(
as
they
frequently
do
)
the
Cavaliero
that
can
make
him
return
again
to
his
Station
among
his
companion
,
be
hold
in
Honour
,
suitable
to
the
Dexterity
and
Address
<EOS>
he
perform
it
with
.
<EOS>
on
their
entrance
into
the
Town
,
all
the
window
be
fill'd
with
spectator
;
a
Pope
pass
in
grand
Procession
could
not
have
more
;
for
what
can
be
more
than
all
?
<EOS>
and
he
or
she
who
should
neglect
so
rare
a
Show
,
would
give
Occasion
to
have
his
or
her
legitimacy
call'd
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
the
Plaza
,
where
the
Stalls
and
Scaffolds
be
build
,
and
upon
which
the
Feats
of
Chivalry
be
to
be
perform
,
it
be
often
with
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
that
the
brute
be
get
in
;
for
there
be
twelve
stall
,
one
for
every
Bull
,
and
as
their
Number
grow
less
by
the
enstalling
of
some
,
the
Remainder
often
prove
more
untractable
and
unruly
:
<EOS>
in
these
stall
they
be
keep
very
dark
,
to
render
them
fiercer
for
the
Day
of
Battle
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
first
of
the
day
appoint
(
for
a
Bull
-
Feast
commonly
last
three
)
all
the
Gentry
of
the
Place
,
or
near
adjacent
,
resort
to
the
Plaza
in
their
most
gaudy
Apparel
,
every
one
vieing
in
make
the
most
glorious
appearance
.
<EOS>
those
in
the
low
rank
provide
themselves
with
Spears
,
or
a
great
many
small
dart
in
their
hand
,
which
they
fail
not
to
cast
or
dart
,
whenever
the
Bull
by
his
Nearness
give
them
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
so
that
the
poor
Creature
may
be
say
to
fight
,
not
only
with
the
Tauriro
(
or
Bullhunter
,
a
person
always
hire
for
that
purpose
)
but
with
the
whole
Multitude
in
the
low
class
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
all
be
seat
,
the
uppermost
Door
be
open'd
first
;
and
as
soon
as
ever
the
Bull
perceive
the
Light
,
out
<EOS>
he
come
,
snuff
up
the
air
,
and
stare
about
him
,
as
if
in
admiration
of
his
attendant
;
and
with
his
tail
cock'd
up
,
he
spurn
the
ground
with
his
Forefeet
,
as
if
he
intend
a
Challenge
to
his
yet
unappeare
Antagonist
.
<EOS>
then
at
a
Door
appoint
for
that
purpose
,
enter
the
Tauriro
all
in
white
,
hold
a
Cloak
in
one
hand
,
and
a
sharp
two
edge
Sword
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
the
Bull
no
sooner
set
eye
upon
him
,
but
wildly
stare
,
he
move
gently
towards
him
;
then
gradually
mend
his
pace
,
till
he
be
come
within
about
the
space
of
twenty
Yards
of
the
Tauriro
;
when
,
with
a
sort
of
spring
,
he
make
at
him
with
all
his
might
.
<EOS>
the
Tauriro
know
by
frequent
experience
,
that
it
behove
him
to
be
watchful
,
slip
aside
just
when
the
Bull
be
at
him
;
when
cast
his
Cloak
over
his
horn
,
at
the
same
Moment
he
give
him
a
slash
or
two
,
always
aim
at
the
Neck
,
where
there
be
one
particular
Place
,
which
if
he
hit
,
he
know
he
shall
easily
bring
him
to
the
Ground
.
<EOS>
I
my
Self
observ'd
<EOS>
the
truth
of
this
Experiment
make
upon
one
of
the
Bulls
,
who
receiv'd
no
more
than
one
Cut
,
which
happen
upon
the
fatal
Spot
,
<EOS>
so
stun'd
him
,
that
he
remain'd
<EOS>
perfectly
stupid
,
the
blood
flow
out
from
the
Wound
,
till
after
a
violent
Trembling
he
dropt
down
stone
dead
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
rarely
happen
,
and
the
poor
Creature
oftner
receive
many
Wounds
,
and
numberless
Darts
,
before
he
die
.
<EOS>
yet
whenever
he
feel
a
fresh
Wound
either
from
Dart
,
Spear
,
or
Sword
,
his
rage
receive
addition
from
the
Wound
,
and
he
pursue
his
Tauriro
with
an
increase
of
Fury
and
Violence
.
<EOS>
and
as
often
as
he
make
at
his
Adversary
,
the
Tauriro
take
care
with
the
utmost
of
his
Agility
to
avoid
him
,
and
reward
his
kind
intention
with
a
new
Wound
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
their
Bulls
will
play
their
part
much
well
than
other
:
but
the
good
must
die
.
<EOS>
for
when
they
have
behav'd
themselves
with
all
the
commendable
Fury
possible
;
if
the
Tauriro
be
spend
,
and
fail
of
do
execution
upon
him
,
they
set
Dogs
upon
him
:
<EOS>
hough
him
and
stick
him
all
over
with
dart
,
till
with
very
loss
of
blood
he
put
an
end
to
their
present
Cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
when
dead
,
a
Man
bring
in
two
mule
dress'd
out
with
Bells
and
Feathers
,
and
fasten
a
rope
about
his
Horns
,
draw
off
the
Bull
with
the
Shouts
and
Acclamations
of
the
Spectators
;
as
if
the
Infidels
have
be
drive
from
before
Ceuta
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
almost
forget
another
very
common
piece
of
barbarous
Pleasure
at
these
diversion
.
<EOS>
the
Tauriro
will
sometimes
stick
one
of
their
Bull
Spears
fast
in
the
ground
,
aslant
,
but
levell'd
<EOS>
as
near
as
he
can
at
his
chest
;
then
present
himself
to
the
Bull
,
just
before
the
point
of
the
Spear
,
on
his
take
his
run
at
the
Tauriro
,
which
,
as
they
assur'd
<EOS>
me
,
he
always
do
with
<EOS>
his
eye
close
<EOS>
,
the
Tauriro
slip
on
one
side
,
and
the
poor
Creature
run
with
a
violence
often
to
stick
himself
,
and
sometimes
to
break
the
Spear
in
his
chest
,
run
away
with
part
of
it
till
he
drop
.
  
<EOS>
this
Tauriro
be
account
one
of
the
good
in
Spain
;
and
indeed
I
see
him
mount
the
back
of
one
of
the
Bulls
,
and
ride
on
him
,
slash
and
cut
,
till
he
have
quite
weary
him
;
at
which
time
dismount
,
he
kill'd
him
with
much
Ease
,
and
to
the
acclamatory
Satisfaction
of
the
whole
concourse
<EOS>
:
for
variety
of
Cruelty
,
as
well
as
dexterity
,
administer
to
their
Delight
.
  
<EOS>
the
Tauriroes
be
very
well
pay
;
and
in
Truth
so
they
ought
to
be
;
for
they
often
lose
their
life
in
the
Diversion
,
as
this
do
the
year
after
in
the
way
of
his
calling
.
<EOS>
yet
be
it
a
Service
of
very
great
profit
when
they
perform
dextrously
:
for
when
ever
they
do
any
thing
remarkable
,
deserve
the
Notice
of
the
Spectators
,
they
never
fail
of
a
generous
Gratification
,
money
be
throw
down
to
'em
in
plenty
.
  
<EOS>
this
Feast
(
as
they
generally
do
)
last
three
Days
;
the
last
of
which
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
much
before
either
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
on
this
,
a
young
Gentleman
,
whose
name
be
Don
Pedro
Ortega
,
a
person
of
great
quality
,
perform'd
the
exercise
on
Horseback
.
<EOS>
the
Seats
,
if
not
more
crowded
,
be
fill
with
People
of
well
Fashion
,
who
come
from
Places
at
a
distance
to
grace
the
noble
Tauriro
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
finely
mount
,
and
make
a
very
graceful
figure
;
but
as
when
the
Foot
Tauriro
engage
,
the
Bull
first
enter
,
so
in
the
Contest
the
Cavaliero
always
make
his
appearance
on
the
Plaza
before
the
Bull
.
<EOS>
His
steed
be
a
manag'd
Horse
;
mount
on
which
he
make
his
Entry
,
attend
by
four
footman
in
rich
livery
;
who
,
as
soon
as
their
Master
have
rid
round
,
and
pay
his
Devoirs
to
all
the
Spectators
,
withdraw
from
the
danger
they
leave
him
expos'd
to
.
<EOS>
the
Cavaliero
have
thus
make
his
bow
,
and
receive
the
repeat
Vivas
of
that
vast
Concourse
,
march'd
with
a
very
stately
air
to
the
very
middle
of
the
Plaza
,
there
stand
ready
to
receive
his
Enemy
at
come
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
Door
be
open'd
,
the
Bull
appear
;
and
as
I
think
with
a
fiercer
and
more
threatne
aspect
<EOS>
that
any
of
the
former
.
<EOS>
He
star'd
around
him
for
a
considerable
time
,
snuff
up
the
air
,
and
spurn
the
ground
,
without
in
the
least
take
notice
of
his
antagonist
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
fix
his
eye
upon
him
,
he
make
a
full
run
at
the
Cavaliero
,
which
he
most
dexterously
avoid
,
and
at
the
same
moment
of
time
,
pass
by
,
he
cast
a
Dart
that
stick
in
his
Shoulders
.
<EOS>
at
this
the
Shouts
and
Vivas
be
repeat
;
and
I
observe
a
Handkerchief
wav'd
twice
or
thrice
,
which
,
as
I
afterwards
understand
,
be
a
Signal
from
the
Lady
of
his
affection
,
that
she
have
behold
him
with
Satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
take
notice
that
the
Cavaliero
endeavour'd
all
he
could
to
keep
aside
the
Bull
,
for
the
advantage
of
the
Stroke
,
when
put
his
Horse
on
a
full
Career
,
he
throw
another
Dart
,
which
fix'd
in
his
side
,
and
so
enrag'd
<EOS>
the
Beast
,
that
he
seem'd
to
renew
his
attack
with
great
fury
.
<EOS>
the
Cavaliero
have
behav'd
himself
to
admiration
,
and
<EOS>
escap'd
many
danger
;
with
the
often
repeat
Acclamations
of
Viva
,
viva
;
when
at
last
the
enraged
Creature
get
his
horn
between
the
Horse
's
hinder
Legs
,
Man
and
Horse
come
both
together
to
the
Ground
.
  
<EOS>
I
expect
at
that
Moment
nothing
less
than
death
could
be
the
issue
;
when
to
the
general
Surprize
,
as
well
as
mine
,
the
very
civil
Brute
,
Author
of
all
the
Mischief
,
only
withdraw
to
the
other
side
of
the
Plaza
,
where
he
stand
still
,
stare
about
him
as
if
he
know
nothing
of
the
Matter
.
  
<EOS>
the
Cavaliero
be
carry'd
<EOS>
off
not
much
hurt
,
but
his
delicate
Beast
suffer'd
much
more
.
<EOS>
however
I
could
not
but
think
afterward
,
that
the
good
natur'd
Bull
come
short
of
fair
play
.
<EOS>
if
I
may
be
pardon'd
<EOS>
the
expression
,
he
have
<EOS>
us'd
his
Adversary
with
more
humanity
than
he
meet
with
;
at
least
,
since
,
after
he
have
the
Cavaliero
under
,
he
generously
forsook
him
;
I
think
he
may
have
plead
,
or
other
for
him
,
for
well
Treatment
than
he
after
meet
with
.
  
<EOS>
for
as
the
Cavaliero
be
disabled
and
carry'd
<EOS>
off
,
the
Foot
Tauriro
enter'd
in
white
Accoutrements
,
as
before
;
but
he
flatter'd
himself
with
an
easy
Conquest
than
he
find
:
there
be
always
on
these
occasion
,
when
he
apprehend
any
imminent
Danger
,
a
Place
of
retreat
ready
for
the
Foot
Tauriro
;
and
well
for
him
there
be
so
;
this
Bull
oblig'd
him
over
and
over
to
make
Use
of
it
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
able
at
last
to
dispatch
him
,
without
a
general
assistance
;
for
I
believe
I
speak
within
Compass
,
when
I
say
,
he
have
more
than
an
hundred
Darts
stick
in
him
.
<EOS>
and
so
barbarously
be
he
mangle
,
and
flash'd
<EOS>
besides
,
that
,
in
my
mind
,
I
could
not
but
think
King
Philip
in
the
right
,
when
he
say
,
that
it
be
a
Custom
deserv'd
little
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
this
Tauridore
,
or
Bull
-
Feast
be
over
,
I
have
a
mind
to
take
a
pleasant
Walk
to
a
little
Town
,
<EOS>
call'd
Minai
,
about
three
league
off
;
but
I
be
scarce
get
out
of
la
Mancha
,
when
an
Acquaintance
meet
me
,
ask'd
where
I
be
go
?
<EOS>
I
tell
him
to
Minai
;
when
take
me
by
the
Hand
,
Friend
Gorgio
,
say
he
in
Spanish
,
come
back
with
me
;
you
shall
not
go
a
Stride
further
;
there
be
picaron
that
way
;
you
shall
not
go
.
<EOS>
inquire
,
as
we
go
back
,
into
his
meaning
,
he
tell
me
,
that
the
day
before
,
a
Man
,
who
have
receive
a
Sum
of
money
in
Pistoles
at
la
Mancha
,
be
,
on
the
road
,
set
upon
by
some
,
who
have
get
notice
of
it
,
and
murder
him
;
that
not
find
the
money
expect
about
him
(
for
he
have
cautiously
enough
leave
it
in
a
friend
's
hand
at
la
Mancha
)
<EOS>
they
conclude
he
have
swallow
it
;
and
therefore
they
ript
up
his
Belly
,
and
open'd
every
gut
;
but
all
to
as
little
purpose
.
<EOS>
this
divert
my
walk
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
but
some
little
time
after
,
the
same
person
invite
me
over
to
the
same
Place
,
to
see
his
Melon
-
Grounds
,
which
in
that
Country
be
wonderful
fine
and
pleasant
;
I
accept
his
invitation
,
and
under
the
Advantage
of
his
Company
,
go
thither
.
<EOS>
on
the
Road
I
take
notice
of
a
Cross
newly
erect
,
and
a
Multitude
of
small
stone
around
the
Foot
of
it
:
ask
the
Meaning
whereof
,
my
friend
tell
me
,
that
it
be
rais'd
for
a
person
there
murder'd
(
as
be
the
Custom
throughout
Spain
)
and
that
every
good
Catholick
pass
by
,
hold
it
his
Duty
to
cast
a
Stone
upon
the
Place
,
in
Detestation
of
the
murder
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
before
take
Notice
of
many
such
crosse
:
but
never
till
then
know
the
meaning
of
their
erection
,
or
the
reason
of
the
heap
of
Stones
around
them
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
place
in
all
Spain
more
famous
for
good
wine
than
Sainte
Clemente
de
la
Mancha
;
nor
be
it
any
where
sell
cheap
:
<EOS>
for
as
it
be
only
an
inland
Town
,
near
no
navigable
River
,
and
the
People
temperate
to
a
Proverb
,
great
plenty
,
and
<EOS>
a
small
vend
must
consequently
make
it
cheap
.
<EOS>
the
Wine
here
be
so
famous
,
that
,
when
I
come
to
Madrid
,
I
see
write
over
the
door
of
host
house
that
sell
Wine
,
Vino
Sainte
Clemente
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
Temperance
of
the
People
,
I
must
say
,
that
notwithstanding
those
two
excellent
quality
of
good
and
cheap
,
I
never
see
,
all
the
three
year
I
be
Prisoner
there
,
any
one
person
overcome
with
drinking
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
there
may
be
a
reason
,
and
a
political
one
,
assign'd
for
that
Abstemiousness
of
theirs
,
which
be
this
,
that
if
any
man
,
upon
any
Occasion
,
should
be
bring
in
as
an
evidence
against
you
,
if
you
can
prove
that
he
be
ever
drunk
,
it
will
invalidate
his
whole
evidence
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
think
this
a
grand
improvement
upon
the
Spartans
.
<EOS>
They
make
their
Slaves
purposely
drunk
,
to
shew
their
Youth
the
Folly
of
the
Vice
by
the
sottish
Behaviour
of
their
servant
under
it
:
but
<EOS>
they
never
reach'd
to
that
noble
height
of
lay
a
penalty
upon
the
Aggressor
,
or
of
discourage
a
voluntary
impotence
of
Reason
by
a
disreputable
impotence
of
Interest
.
<EOS>
the
Spaniard
therefore
,
in
my
opinion
,
in
this
exceed
the
Spartan
,
as
much
as
a
natural
Beauty
exceed
one
procure
by
art
;
for
tho
'
Shame
may
somewhat
influence
some
few
,
Terrour
be
of
force
to
deter
all
.
<EOS>
a
man
,
we
have
see
it
,
may
shake
Hands
with
shame
;
but
<EOS>
interest
,
say
another
Proverb
,
will
never
lye
.
<EOS>
a
wise
institution
therefore
doubtless
be
this
of
the
Spaniard
;
but
such
as
I
fear
will
never
take
Place
in
Germany
,
Holland
,
France
,
or
Great
Britain
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
I
commend
their
Temperance
,
I
would
not
be
think
by
any
Means
to
approve
of
their
Bigotry
.
<EOS>
if
there
may
be
such
a
thing
as
Intemperance
in
Religion
,
I
much
fear
their
Ebriety
in
that
will
be
find
to
be
over
-
measure
.
<EOS>
under
the
notion
of
Devotion
,
I
have
see
man
among
'em
,
and
of
sense
too
,
guilty
of
the
gross
intemperancie
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
common
to
be
a
rarity
to
see
their
don
of
the
prime
Quality
as
well
as
those
of
the
low
Ranks
,
upon
meet
a
Priest
in
the
open
street
,
condescend
to
take
up
the
low
part
of
his
Vestment
,
and
salute
it
with
eye
erect
as
if
they
look'd
<EOS>
upon
it
as
the
Seal
of
Salvation
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
Ave
-
Bell
be
hear
,
the
Hearer
must
down
on
his
Knees
upon
the
very
spot
;
nor
be
he
allow
the
small
indulgence
of
defer
a
little
,
till
he
can
recover
a
clean
place
;
<EOS>
dirtiness
excuse
not
,
nor
will
dirty
action
by
any
mean
exempt
.
<EOS>
this
be
so
notorious
,
that
even
at
the
Play
-
house
,
in
the
middle
of
a
Scene
,
on
the
first
sound
of
the
Bell
,
the
actor
drop
their
discourse
,
the
auditor
supersede
the
indulging
of
their
unsanctified
Ears
,
and
all
on
their
heart
,
quite
a
different
way
,
to
what
they
just
before
have
be
employ'd
in
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
tho
<EOS>
'
they
pretend
in
all
this
to
an
extraordinary
measure
of
Zeal
and
real
devotion
;
no
man
,
that
live
among
them
any
time
,
can
be
a
proselyte
to
them
without
immolate
his
Senses
and
his
reason
:
yet
I
must
confess
,
while
I
have
see
them
thus
delude
themselves
with
Ave
Marias
,
I
<EOS>
you
would
not
refrain
throw
up
my
eye
to
the
only
proper
Object
of
Adoration
,
in
commiseration
of
such
delusion
.
  
<EOS>
the
hour
of
the
Ave
Bell
,
be
eight
and
twelve
in
the
morning
,
and
six
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
They
pretend
at
the
first
to
fall
down
in
beg
that
God
would
be
pleas'd
to
prosper
them
in
all
thing
they
go
about
that
day
.
<EOS>
at
twelve
they
return
thank
for
their
preservation
to
that
time
;
and
at
six
for
that
of
the
whole
day
.
<EOS>
after
which
,
one
would
think
that
they
imagine
themselves
at
perfect
Liberty
;
and
their
open
Gallantries
perfectly
countenance
the
imagination
:
for
tho
'
Adultery
be
look'd
upon
as
a
grievous
crime
,
and
punish'd
accordingly
;
yet
Fornication
be
soften
with
the
title
of
a
Venial
Sin
,
and
they
seem
to
practise
it
under
that
Persuasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
here
,
what
Erasmus
ridicule
with
so
much
Wit
and
Delicacy
,
the
custom
of
bury
in
a
Franciscan
's
habit
,
in
mighty
request
.
<EOS>
if
they
can
for
that
purpose
procure
an
old
one
at
the
price
of
a
new
one
;
the
Purchaser
wil
look
upon
himself
a
provident
Chap
,
that
have
secur'd
to
his
deceased
Friend
or
Relation
,
no
less
than
Heaven
by
that
wise
Bargain
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
be
almost
the
only
time
of
Enjoyment
of
Company
,
or
Conversation
,
every
body
in
Spain
then
greedily
seek
it
;
and
the
street
be
at
that
time
crowd
like
our
fine
Gardens
or
most
private
Walks
.
<EOS>
on
one
of
those
occasion
,
I
meet
a
Don
of
my
Acquaintance
walk
out
with
his
sister
;
and
as
I
think
it
become
an
English
Cavalier
,
I
salute
him
:
<EOS>
but
to
my
Surprize
he
never
return'd
the
Civility
.
<EOS>
when
I
meet
him
the
day
after
,
instead
of
an
Apology
,
as
I
have
flatter
my
self
,
I
receive
a
Reprimand
,
tho
'
a
very
civil
one
;
tell
me
it
be
the
Custom
in
Spain
,
nor
well
take
of
any
one
,
that
take
Notice
of
any
who
be
walk
in
the
Company
of
Ladies
at
Night
.
  
<EOS>
but
a
night
or
two
after
,
I
find
by
experience
,
that
if
the
Men
be
by
Custom
prohibit
take
notice
,
woman
be
not
.
<EOS>
I
be
stand
at
the
Door
,
in
the
cool
of
the
Evening
,
when
a
woman
seemingly
genteel
,
pass
by
,
<EOS>
call'd
me
by
my
name
,
tell
me
she
want
to
speak
with
me
:
She
have
her
Mantilio
on
;
so
that
have
I
have
day
-
light
<EOS>
,
I
could
have
only
see
one
Eye
of
her
.
<EOS>
however
I
walk'd
<EOS>
with
her
a
good
while
,
without
be
able
to
discover
any
thing
of
her
Business
,
nor
pass'd
there
between
us
any
thing
more
than
a
conversation
upon
indifferent
matter
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
at
part
she
tell
me
she
should
pass
by
again
the
next
evening
;
and
if
I
would
be
at
the
Door
,
she
would
give
me
the
same
advantage
of
a
Conversation
,
that
seem'd
not
to
displease
me
.
<EOS>
accordingly
the
next
night
she
come
,
and
as
before
we
walk'd
together
in
the
private
part
of
the
Town
:
for
tho
'
I
know
her
not
,
her
discourse
be
always
entertaining
and
full
of
Wit
,
and
her
Enquiries
not
often
improper
.
<EOS>
We
have
continu'd
<EOS>
this
Intercourse
many
Nights
together
,
when
my
Landlady
's
daughter
have
take
Notice
of
it
,
stopt
me
one
evening
,
and
would
not
allow
me
to
stand
at
the
usual
Post
of
Intelligence
,
say
,
with
a
good
deal
of
heat
,
Don
Gorgio
,
take
my
advice
;
go
no
more
along
with
that
woman
:
<EOS>
You
may
soon
be
bring
home
deprive
of
your
life
if
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
,
whether
she
know
her
;
but
this
I
must
say
,
she
be
very
agreeable
in
Wit
as
well
as
person
.
<EOS>
however
my
Landlady
and
her
daughter
take
that
opportunity
of
give
me
so
many
instance
of
the
fatal
issue
of
such
innocent
conversation
,
(
for
I
could
not
call
it
an
Intrigue
)
<EOS>
that
apprehensive
enough
of
the
Danger
,
on
lay
circumstance
together
<EOS>
,
I
take
their
advice
,
and
never
go
into
her
company
after
.
  
<EOS>
Sainte
Clemente
de
la
Mancha
,
where
I
so
long
remain'd
<EOS>
a
Prisoner
of
War
,
lie
in
the
Road
from
Madrid
to
Valencia
;
and
the
Duke
of
Vendome
be
order
to
the
latter
,
great
preparation
be
make
for
his
Entertainment
,
as
he
pass'd
through
.
<EOS>
He
stay'd
here
<EOS>
only
one
Night
,
where
he
be
very
handsomely
treat
by
the
Corrigidore
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
fair
person
,
and
very
fat
,
and
at
the
time
I
see
him
wear
a
long
black
patch
over
his
left
Eye
;
but
on
what
Occasion
I
could
not
learn
.
<EOS>
the
afterwards
famous
Alberoni
(
since
make
a
Cardinal
)
be
in
his
Attendance
;
as
indeed
the
Duke
be
very
rarely
without
him
.
<EOS>
I
remember
that
very
Day
three
week
,
they
return'd
through
the
same
place
;
the
Duke
in
his
Herse
,
and
Alberoni
in
a
Coach
,
pay
his
last
duty
.
<EOS>
that
Duke
be
a
prodigious
Lover
of
Fish
,
of
which
have
eat
over
heartily
at
Veneros
,
in
the
Province
of
Valencia
,
he
take
a
Surfeit
,
and
die
in
three
day
'
time
.
<EOS>
His
Corps
be
carry
to
the
Escurial
,
there
to
be
bury
in
the
Panthaeon
among
their
king
.
  
<EOS>
the
Castilians
have
a
privilege
by
licence
from
the
Pope
,
which
,
if
it
could
have
be
convert
into
a
Prohibition
,
may
have
sav'd
that
Duke
's
life
:
in
regard
their
country
be
wholly
inland
,
and
the
River
Tagus
famous
for
its
poverty
,
or
rather
Barrenness
;
their
Holy
Father
indulge
the
Natives
with
the
Liberty
,
in
lieu
of
that
dangerous
eatable
,
of
eat
all
Lent
time
the
Inwards
of
Cattle
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
hear
this
relate
,
I
imagin'd
,
that
the
Garbidge
have
be
intend
,
but
I
be
soon
after
this
rectify'd
,
by
Inwards
(
for
so
expressly
say
the
licence
<EOS>
it
self
)
be
mean
the
Heart
,
the
Liver
,
and
the
Feet
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
here
as
well
as
in
most
other
Parts
of
Spain
,
Valencia
except
,
the
most
wretched
Musick
in
the
Universe
.
<EOS>
Their
guitar
,
if
not
their
Sole
,
be
their
darle
instrument
,
and
what
they
most
delight
in
:
tho
'
in
my
opinion
<EOS>
our
English
sailor
be
not
much
amiss
in
give
them
the
Title
of
Strum
Strums
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
little
well
than
our
Jews
-
harps
,
tho
'
hardly
half
<EOS>
so
musical
.
<EOS>
yet
be
they
perpetually
at
Nights
disturb
their
woman
with
the
noise
of
them
,
under
the
notion
and
name
of
Serenadoes
.
<EOS>
from
the
Barber
to
the
Grandee
the
infection
spread
,
and
very
often
with
the
same
Attendant
,
Danger
:
<EOS>
Night
Quarrels
and
Rencounters
be
the
frequent
Result
.
<EOS>
the
true
bear
Spaniards
reckon
it
a
part
of
their
Glory
,
to
be
jealous
of
their
mistress
,
which
be
too
often
the
Forerunner
of
Murders
;
at
best
attend
with
many
other
very
dangerous
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
and
yet
bad
as
their
Musick
be
,
their
dancing
be
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
Country
Girl
manage
her
Castanets
with
the
graceful
Air
of
a
Dutchess
,
and
that
not
to
common
Musick
;
but
to
Peoples
beat
or
drum
a
Tune
with
their
hand
on
a
table
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
half
a
dozen
couple
at
a
time
dance
to
the
like
in
excellent
order
.
  
<EOS>
I
just
now
distinguish'd
,
by
an
Exception
,
the
Music
of
Valencia
,
where
alone
I
experience
the
use
of
the
Violin
;
which
tho
'
I
can
not
,
in
respect
to
other
country
,
call
good
;
yet
in
respect
to
the
other
part
of
Spain
,
I
must
acknowledge
it
much
the
good
.
<EOS>
in
my
account
of
that
city
,
I
omit
to
speak
of
it
;
therefore
now
to
supply
that
Defect
,
I
will
speak
of
the
good
I
hear
,
which
be
on
this
unfortunate
Occasion
:
<EOS>
several
native
of
that
Country
have
receive
Sentence
of
Death
for
their
adherence
to
King
Charles
,
be
accordingly
order
to
the
Place
of
Execution
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
Custom
there
,
on
all
such
occasion
,
for
all
the
Musick
of
the
City
to
meet
near
the
Gallows
,
and
play
the
most
affecting
and
melancholy
Airs
,
to
the
very
approach
of
the
Condemn'd
;
and
really
the
Musick
be
so
move
,
it
heighten
the
Scene
of
Sorrow
,
and
bring
Compassion
into
the
eye
of
even
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
Condemn'd
,
they
come
stript
of
their
own
cloath
,
and
cover'd
with
black
frock
,
in
which
they
be
lead
along
the
street
to
the
Place
of
Execution
,
the
friar
pray
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
when
they
come
through
any
Street
,
be
any
public
image
be
fix'd
,
they
stay'd
<EOS>
before
'em
some
reasonable
time
in
Prayer
with
the
friar
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
arriv'd
at
the
fatal
Place
,
those
father
leave
'em
not
,
but
continue
pray
and
give
them
ghostly
Encouragement
,
stand
upon
the
round
of
the
Ladder
till
they
be
turn'd
off
.
<EOS>
the
Hangman
always
wear
a
silver
Badge
of
a
Ladder
to
distinguish
his
profession
:
<EOS>
but
his
manner
of
execute
his
Office
have
somewhat
in
it
too
singular
to
allow
of
Silence
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
ty'd
fast
the
Hands
of
the
Criminal
,
he
rest
his
knee
upon
them
,
and
with
one
hand
on
the
Criminal
's
nostril
,
to
stop
his
breath
the
sooner
,
throw
himself
off
the
Ladder
along
with
the
die
Party
.
<EOS>
this
he
do
to
expedite
his
Fate
;
tho
"
consider
the
Force
,
I
wonder
it
do
not
tear
Head
and
Body
asunder
;
<EOS>
which
yet
I
never
hear
that
it
do
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
la
Mancha
;
I
have
be
there
now
upwards
of
two
year
,
much
divert
with
the
good
Humour
and
Kindness
of
the
gentleman
,
and
daily
pleased
with
the
Conversation
of
the
Nuns
of
the
Nunnery
opposite
to
my
Lodgings
<EOS>
;
when
walk
one
Day
alone
upon
the
Plaza
,
I
find
my
self
accost
by
a
Clerico
.
<EOS>
at
the
first
attack
,
he
tell
me
his
country
:
but
add
,
that
he
now
come
from
Madrid
with
a
Potent
,
that
be
his
Word
,
from
Pedro
de
Dios
,
Dean
of
the
Inquisition
,
to
endeavour
the
Conversion
of
any
of
the
English
Prisoners
;
that
be
an
irish
-
man
,
as
a
sort
of
a
brother
,
he
have
conceive
a
Love
for
the
English
,
and
therefore
more
eagerly
embrace
the
opportunity
which
the
Holy
Inquisition
have
put
into
his
Hands
for
the
bringing
over
to
Mother
Church
as
many
Hereticks
as
he
could
;
that
have
hear
a
very
good
character
of
me
,
he
should
think
himself
very
happy
,
if
he
could
be
instrumental
in
my
salvation
;
  
"
It
be
very
true
,
<EOS>
continu'd
<EOS>
he
,
I
have
lately
have
the
good
Fortune
to
convert
many
;
and
besides
the
Candour
of
my
own
disposition
,
I
must
tell
you
,
that
I
have
a
peculiar
knack
at
Conversion
,
which
very
few
,
if
any
,
ever
could
resist
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
upon
the
same
work
into
Murcia
;
but
your
good
character
be
fix'd
me
in
my
resolution
of
prefer
your
salvation
to
that
of
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
very
long
,
and
no
less
surprising
address
,
I
only
return'd
,
that
it
be
an
Affair
of
moment
,
it
would
require
some
consideration
;
and
that
by
the
time
he
return'd
from
Murcia
,
I
may
be
able
to
return
him
a
proper
answer
.
<EOS>
but
not
at
all
satisfy'd
with
this
reply
;
  
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
God
Almighty
be
all
-
sufficient
:
<EOS>
this
moment
be
too
precious
to
be
lose
;
he
can
turn
the
heart
in
the
twinkling
of
an
Eye
,
as
well
as
in
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
hear
me
then
;
mind
what
I
say
to
you
:
I
will
convince
you
immediately
.
<EOS>
You
Hereticks
do
not
believe
in
Transubstantiation
,
and
yet
do
not
our
Saviour
say
in
so
many
word
,
Hoc
est
corpus
meum
?
<EOS>
and
if
you
do
not
believe
him
,
do
not
you
give
him
the
Lye
?
<EOS>
besides
,
do
not
one
of
the
Fatherss
ay
,
Deus
,
qui
est
omnis
Veritas
,
non
potest
dicere
falsum
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
go
on
at
the
same
ridiculous
rate
;
which
soon
convince
me
,
he
be
a
thorough
Rattle
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
a
Clerico
,
and
consequently
in
this
Country
,
a
man
dangerous
to
disoblige
,
I
invite
him
home
to
dinner
;
where
when
I
have
bring
him
,
I
find
I
have
no
way
do
an
unacceptable
thing
;
for
my
Landlady
and
her
daughter
,
see
him
to
be
a
Clergyman
,
receiv'd
him
with
a
vast
deal
of
Respect
and
Pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
dinner
be
over
<EOS>
,
he
begin
to
entertain
me
with
a
detail
of
the
many
wonderful
conversion
he
have
make
upon
obstinate
Hereticks
;
that
he
have
convince
the
most
stubborn
,
and
have
such
a
Nostrum
,
that
he
would
undertake
to
convert
any
one
.
<EOS>
here
he
begin
his
old
round
,
intermix
his
harangue
with
such
scrap
and
raw
sentence
of
fustian
Latin
,
that
I
grow
weary
of
his
Conversation
;
so
pretend
some
business
of
consequence
,
I
take
leave
,
and
leave
him
and
my
Landlady
together
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
return
till
pretty
late
in
the
evening
,
with
intent
to
give
him
Time
enough
to
think
his
own
visit
tedious
;
but
to
my
great
Surprize
,
I
find
my
irish
Missionary
still
on
the
Spot
,
ready
to
dare
me
to
the
Encounter
,
and
resolv'd
,
like
a
true
Son
of
the
Church
militant
,
to
keep
last
on
the
Field
of
Battle
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
have
seat
my
self
,
he
begin
again
to
tell
me
,
how
good
a
Character
my
Landlady
have
give
me
,
which
have
prodigiously
increase
his
ardour
of
save
my
soul
;
that
he
could
not
answer
it
to
his
own
Character
,
as
well
as
mine
,
to
be
negligent
;
and
therefore
he
have
enter'd
into
a
resolution
to
stay
my
coming
,
though
it
have
be
later
.
<EOS>
to
all
which
,
I
return'd
<EOS>
him
Abundance
of
thank
for
his
good
will
,
but
plead
indisposition
and
want
of
Rest
,
after
a
good
deal
of
civil
Impertinence
,
I
once
more
get
rid
of
him
;
at
least
,
I
take
my
leave
,
and
go
to
Bed
,
leave
him
again
Master
of
the
field
;
for
I
understand
next
Morning
,
that
he
stay'd
some
Time
after
I
be
go
,
with
my
good
Landlady
.
  
<EOS>
Next
morning
the
Nuns
of
the
Nunnery
opposite
,
have
take
Notice
of
the
Clerico
's
Ingress
,
long
visit
,
and
late
Egress
,
send
to
know
whether
he
be
my
Countryman
;
with
many
other
Questions
,
which
I
be
not
then
let
into
the
Secret
of
.
<EOS>
to
all
which
I
return'd
,
that
he
be
no
Countryman
of
mine
,
but
an
irish
-
man
,
and
so
perfectly
a
Stranger
to
me
,
that
I
know
no
more
of
him
than
what
I
have
from
his
own
Mouth
,
that
he
be
go
into
Murcia
.
<EOS>
what
the
meaning
of
this
enquiry
be
,
I
could
never
learn
;
but
I
could
not
doubt
,
but
it
proceed
from
their
great
care
of
their
Vicino
,
as
they
call'd
me
;
a
Mark
of
their
esteem
,
and
of
which
I
be
not
a
little
proud
.
  
<EOS>
as
be
my
usual
Custom
,
I
have
be
take
my
Morning
Walk
,
and
have
not
be
long
come
home
in
order
to
Dinner
,
when
in
again
drop
my
Irish
Clerico
;
I
be
confound
,
and
vexed
,
and
he
could
not
avoid
take
Notice
of
it
;
nevertheless
,
without
the
least
Alteration
of
Countenance
,
he
take
his
seat
;
and
on
my
saying
,
in
a
cold
and
indifferent
Tone
,
<EOS>
that
I
imagin'd
<EOS>
he
have
be
get
to
Murcia
before
this
;
he
reply'd
,
with
a
natural
Fleer
,
that
truely
he
be
go
to
Murcia
,
but
his
Conscience
prick
him
,
and
he
do
find
that
he
could
not
go
away
with
any
Satisfaction
,
or
peace
of
Mind
,
without
make
me
a
perfect
Convert
;
that
he
have
plainly
discover
in
me
a
good
disposition
,
and
have
,
for
that
very
Reason
,
put
himself
to
the
charge
of
Man
and
Mule
,
to
the
Bishop
of
Cuenca
for
a
licence
,
under
his
Hand
,
for
my
conversion
:
<EOS>
for
in
Spain
,
all
private
missionary
be
oblige
to
ask
Leave
of
the
next
Bishop
,
before
they
dare
enter
upon
any
Enterprize
of
this
Nature
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
more
confounded
at
this
last
assurance
of
the
Man
than
at
all
before
;
and
it
put
me
directly
upon
reflect
,
whether
any
,
and
what
Inconveniences
may
ensue
,
from
a
Rencounter
that
I
,
at
first
,
conceiv'd
ridiculous
,
but
may
now
reasonably
begin
to
have
more
dangerous
apprehension
of
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
by
the
Articles
of
War
<EOS>
,
all
person
be
exempt
from
any
Power
of
the
inquisition
;
but
whether
carry
on
a
part
in
such
a
Farce
,
may
not
admit
,
or
at
least
be
liable
to
some
dangerous
construction
,
be
not
imprudently
now
to
be
consider
.
<EOS>
though
I
be
not
fearful
,
yet
I
resolv'd
to
be
cautious
.
<EOS>
wherefore
not
make
any
answer
to
his
Declaration
about
the
Bishop
,
he
take
Notice
of
it
;
and
to
raise
a
confidence
,
he
find
expire
,
begin
to
tell
me
,
that
his
name
be
Murtough
Brennan
,
that
he
be
bear
near
Kilkenny
,
of
a
very
considerable
family
.
<EOS>
this
last
part
indeed
,
when
I
come
to
Madrid
,
I
find
pretty
well
confirm'd
in
a
considerable
manner
.
<EOS>
however
,
take
notice
that
he
have
alter'd
<EOS>
his
Tone
of
leave
the
Town
,
and
that
instead
of
it
,
he
be
advance
somewhat
like
an
invitation
of
himself
to
Dinner
the
next
day
,
I
resolv'd
to
show
my
self
shy
of
him
;
and
thereupon
abruptly
,
and
without
take
any
Leave
,
I
leave
the
Room
,
and
my
Landlady
and
him
together
.
  
<EOS>
three
or
four
day
have
pass
,
every
one
of
which
,
he
never
fail'd
my
lodging
;
not
at
Dinner
Time
only
,
but
Night
and
Morning
too
;
from
all
which
I
begin
to
suspect
,
that
instead
of
my
Conversion
,
he
have
fix'd
upon
a
re
-
conversion
of
my
Landlady
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
young
,
yet
,
for
a
black
woman
,
handsom
enough
;
and
her
Daughter
very
pretty
:
I
enter
into
a
resolution
to
make
my
observation
,
and
watch
them
all
at
a
Distance
;
nevertheless
carefully
conceal
my
jealousy
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
must
confess
,
I
be
not
a
little
pleas'd
,
that
any
Thing
could
divert
my
own
persecution
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
no
longer
my
guest
,
but
my
Landlady
's
,
with
whom
I
find
him
so
much
take
up
,
that
a
little
care
may
frustrate
all
his
former
impertinent
importunity
on
the
old
Topick
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
my
suspicion
be
very
soon
after
turn'd
into
certainty
,
in
this
manner
:
I
have
be
abroad
,
and
return
somewhat
weary
<EOS>
,
I
go
to
my
Chamber
,
to
take
,
what
in
that
Country
they
call
,
a
Cesto
,
upon
my
Bed
<EOS>
:
I
get
in
unseen
,
or
without
see
any
body
,
but
have
scarce
lay
my
self
down
,
before
my
young
Landlady
,
as
I
jestingly
us'd
to
call
the
daughter
,
rush
into
my
Room
,
throw
her
self
down
on
the
Floor
,
bitterly
exclaim
.
<EOS>
I
start
off
my
Bed
,
and
immediately
run
to
the
Door
,
who
should
I
meet
there
but
my
Irish
Clerico
,
without
his
Habit
,
and
in
his
shirt
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
doubt
,
by
the
Dishabille
of
the
Clerico
,
but
the
young
Creature
have
Reason
enough
for
her
Passion
,
which
render'd
me
quite
unable
to
master
mine
;
<EOS>
wherefore
as
he
stand
with
his
back
next
the
Door
,
I
thrust
him
in
that
ghostly
Plight
into
the
open
Street
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
,
with
leisure
enough
,
have
repent
that
precipitate
Piece
of
Indiscretion
;
if
it
have
not
be
for
his
bad
character
,
and
the
favourable
Opinion
the
Town
have
conceive
of
me
;
for
he
inordinately
exclaim'd
<EOS>
against
me
,
call
me
Heretick
,
and
tell
the
People
,
who
be
soon
gather
round
him
,
that
come
to
my
Lodgings
on
the
charitable
work
of
Conversion
,
I
have
thus
abus'd
him
,
stript
him
of
his
Habit
,
and
then
turn'd
him
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
the
Nuns
,
on
their
hearing
the
Outcries
he
make
,
come
run
to
their
Grates
,
to
enquire
into
the
Matter
,
and
when
they
understand
it
,
as
he
be
pleas'd
to
relate
it
;
though
they
condemn'd
<EOS>
my
zeal
,
they
pity'd
<EOS>
my
condition
.
<EOS>
very
well
be
it
for
me
,
that
I
stand
more
than
a
little
well
in
the
good
Opinion
of
the
Town
;
among
the
Gentry
,
by
my
frequent
Conversation
,
and
the
inferior
sort
by
my
charitable
distribution
;
for
nothing
can
be
more
dangerous
,
or
a
near
way
to
violent
Fate
,
than
to
insult
one
of
the
Clergy
in
Spain
,
and
especially
,
for
such
an
one
as
they
entitle
a
Heretick
.
  
<EOS>
My
old
Landlady
(
I
speak
in
respect
to
her
daughter
)
however
formerly
my
seeming
friend
,
come
in
a
violent
passion
,
and
wrench
the
Door
out
of
my
Hands
,
open
it
,
and
pull'd
<EOS>
her
Clerico
in
;
and
so
soon
as
she
have
do
this
,
she
take
his
part
,
and
rail
so
bitterly
at
me
,
that
I
have
no
reason
longer
to
doubt
her
thorough
Conversion
,
under
the
full
Power
of
his
Mission
.
<EOS>
however
the
young
one
stand
her
ground
,
and
by
all
her
Expressions
,
give
her
many
Inquirers
Reason
enough
to
believe
,
all
be
not
matter
of
Faith
that
the
Clerico
have
advance
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
hold
it
adviseable
to
change
my
Lodgings
,
and
a
friend
confirm
my
resolution
,
I
remove
that
Night
.
  
<EOS>
the
Clerico
have
put
on
his
upper
Garments
,
be
run
away
to
the
Corrigidor
,
in
a
violent
fury
,
resolve
to
be
early
,
as
well
know
,
that
he
who
tell
his
Story
first
,
have
the
Prospect
of
tell
it
to
double
advantage
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
there
,
he
tell
that
Officer
a
thousand
idle
story
,
and
in
the
bad
manner
;
repeat
how
I
have
abus'd
him
,
and
not
him
only
,
but
my
poor
Landlady
,
for
take
his
Part
.
<EOS>
the
Corrigidor
be
glad
to
hear
it
all
,
and
with
an
officious
Ear
fish'd
for
a
great
deal
more
;
expecting
,
accord
to
Usage
,
at
last
to
squeeze
a
Sum
of
money
out
of
me
.
<EOS>
however
he
tell
the
Clerico
,
that
,
as
I
be
a
Prisoner
of
War
,
he
have
no
direct
power
over
me
;
but
if
he
would
immediately
write
to
the
President
Ronquillo
,
at
Madrid
,
he
would
not
fail
to
give
his
immediate
Orders
,
accord
to
which
he
would
as
readily
act
against
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
Clerico
resolv'd
to
pursue
his
old
Maxim
and
cry
out
first
;
and
so
take
the
Corrigidor
's
Advice
,
he
write
away
to
Madrid
directly
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
the
People
in
the
Town
,
both
high
and
low
,
some
out
of
Curiosity
,
some
out
of
friendship
,
pursu'd
their
enquiry
into
the
reality
of
the
Facts
.
<EOS>
the
old
Landlady
they
could
make
little
of
to
my
advantage
;
but
whenever
the
young
one
come
to
the
Question
,
she
always
leave
them
with
these
word
in
her
Mouth
,
El
Diabolo
en
<EOS>
forma
del
Clerico
,
which
rendre
thing
more
than
a
little
cloudy
on
the
Clerico
's
side
<EOS>
,
he
be
<EOS>
advis'd
and
press'd
by
his
few
Friends
,
as
fast
as
he
could
to
get
out
of
Town
;
Nuns
,
Clergy
,
and
every
body
take
part
against
him
,
except
his
new
Convert
,
my
old
Landlady
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
after
,
as
I
be
sit
with
a
friend
at
my
new
Quarters
,
Maria
(
for
that
be
the
name
of
my
Landlady
's
daughter
)
come
run
in
with
these
word
in
her
Mouth
,
El
Clerico
,
el
Clerico
,
passa
la
Calle
.
<EOS>
We
hasten'd
to
the
Window
,
<EOS>
out
of
which
we
beheld
the
Clerico
,
Murtough
Brennan
,
pitifully
mount
on
the
back
of
a
very
poor
as
(
for
they
would
neither
let
,
nor
lend
him
a
Mule
through
all
the
Town
)
<EOS>
his
Legs
almost
rest
on
the
ground
,
for
he
be
lusty
,
as
his
Ass
be
little
;
and
a
fellow
with
a
large
Cudgel
march'd
a
-
foot
,
drive
his
Ass
along
.
<EOS>
never
do
Sancha
Pancha
,
on
his
Embassage
to
Dulcinea
,
make
such
a
despicable
,
out
of
the
way
Figure
,
as
our
Clerico
do
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
and
what
increas'd
our
Mirth
be
,
their
tell
me
,
that
our
Clerico
,
like
that
Squire
(
tho
'
upon
his
own
Priest
-
Errantry
)
be
actually
on
his
March
to
Toboso
,
a
place
five
league
off
,
famous
for
the
Nativity
of
Dulcinea
,
the
Object
of
the
passion
of
that
celebrate
Hero
Don
Quixot
.
<EOS>
so
I
will
leave
our
Clerico
on
his
Journey
to
Murcia
,
to
relate
the
unhappy
Sequel
of
this
ridiculous
Affair
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
before
say
,
that
,
by
the
Advice
of
the
Corrigidor
,
our
Clerico
have
write
to
Don
Ronquillo
at
Madrid
.
<EOS>
about
a
fortnight
after
his
departure
from
la
Mancha
,
I
be
sit
alone
in
my
new
Lodgings
,
when
two
Alguizils
(
officer
under
the
Corrigidor
,
and
in
the
Nature
of
our
bailiff
)
come
into
my
Room
,
but
very
civilly
,
to
tell
me
,
that
they
have
order
to
carry
me
away
to
prison
;
but
at
the
same
Moment
they
advis'd
me
,
not
to
be
afraid
;
for
they
have
observe
,
that
the
whole
Town
be
concern'd
at
what
the
Corrigidor
and
Clerico
have
do
;
add
,
that
it
be
their
opinion
,
that
I
should
find
so
general
<EOS>
a
Friendship
,
that
I
need
not
be
apprehensive
of
any
Danger
.
<EOS>
with
these
plausible
speech
,
though
I
afterwards
experience
the
Truth
of
them
,
I
resign'd
my
self
,
and
go
with
them
to
a
much
close
Confinement
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
there
above
a
day
or
two
,
before
many
gentleman
of
the
Place
send
to
me
,
to
assure
me
<EOS>
,
they
be
heartily
afflict
at
my
Confinement
,
and
resolv'd
to
write
in
my
favour
to
Madrid
;
but
as
it
be
not
safe
,
nor
the
Custom
in
Spain
,
to
visit
those
in
my
present
circumstance
,
they
hope
I
would
not
take
it
amiss
,
since
they
be
bent
to
act
all
in
their
power
towards
my
deliverance
;
conclude
however
with
their
advice
,
that
I
would
not
give
one
real
of
Plata
to
the
Corrigidor
,
whom
they
hate
,
but
confide
in
their
assiduous
Interposal
,
Don
Pedro
de
Ortega
in
particular
,
the
person
that
perform'd
the
part
of
the
Tauriro
on
Horseback
,
sometime
before
,
send
me
Word
<EOS>
,
he
would
not
fail
to
write
to
a
relation
of
his
,
of
the
first
Account
in
Madrid
,
and
so
represent
the
Affair
,
that
I
should
not
long
be
debarr'd
my
old
Acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
administer
,
perhaps
,
Matter
of
Wonder
,
that
Spaniards
,
Gentlemen
of
the
stanchest
Punctilio
,
should
make
a
Scruple
and
execute
themselves
from
visit
Persons
under
Confinement
,
when
,
accord
to
all
Christian
Acceptation
,
such
a
Circumstance
would
render
such
a
visit
,
not
charitable
only
but
generous
.
<EOS>
but
though
man
of
vulgar
spirit
may
,
from
the
Narrowness
of
their
view
,
form
such
insipid
Excuses
,
those
of
these
gentleman
,
I
very
well
know
,
proceed
from
much
more
excusable
topick
.
<EOS>
I
be
commit
under
the
Accusation
of
have
abus'd
a
sacred
person
,
one
of
the
Clergy
;
and
though
,
as
a
Prisoner
of
War
,
I
may
deem
my
self
exempt
from
the
Power
of
the
inquisition
;
yet
how
far
one
of
that
Country
,
visit
a
person
,
so
accuse
,
may
be
esteem
culpable
,
be
a
consideration
in
that
dangerous
Climate
,
far
from
deserve
to
be
slight
.
<EOS>
to
me
therefore
,
who
well
know
the
Customs
of
the
Country
,
and
the
Temper
of
its
countryman
,
their
excuse
be
not
only
allowable
,
but
acceptable
also
;
for
,
without
call
in
Question
their
Charity
,
I
verily
<EOS>
believ'd
<EOS>
I
may
falsely
confide
in
their
Honour
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
after
I
have
be
a
close
Prisoner
one
Month
to
a
day
,
I
find
the
Benefit
of
these
gentleman
's
Promises
and
Solicitations
.
<EOS>
pursuant
to
which
,
an
order
be
bring
for
my
immediate
discharge
;
notwithstanding
,
the
new
Convert
,
my
old
Landlady
,
do
all
she
could
to
make
her
appear
against
me
effectual
,
to
the
Height
of
her
Prejudice
and
Malice
,
even
while
the
Daughter
,
as
sensible
of
my
innocence
,
and
act
with
a
much
well
Conscience
,
endeavour
as
much
to
justify
me
,
against
both
the
Threats
and
Persuasions
of
the
Corrigidor
,
and
his
few
accomplice
,
though
her
own
Mother
make
one
.
  
<EOS>
after
Receipt
of
this
order
for
my
enlargement
,
I
be
mightily
press'd
by
Don
Felix
,
and
other
of
my
Friends
,
to
go
to
Madrid
,
and
enter
my
complaint
against
the
Corrigidor
and
the
Clerico
,
as
a
thing
highly
essential
to
my
own
future
Security
.
<EOS>
without
ask
Leave
therefore
of
the
Corrigidor
,
or
in
the
least
acquaint
him
with
it
,
I
set
out
from
la
Mancha
,
and
,
as
I
afterwards
understand
,
to
the
terrible
Alarm
of
that
gripe
Officer
;
who
be
under
the
great
Consternation
,
when
he
hear
I
be
go
;
for
as
he
know
very
well
,
that
he
have
do
more
than
he
could
justify
,
he
be
very
apprehensive
of
any
complaint
;
<EOS>
well
know
,
that
as
he
be
hate
as
much
as
I
be
beloved
,
he
may
assure
himself
of
the
Want
of
that
assistance
from
the
Gentlemen
,
which
I
have
experience
.
  
<EOS>
so
soon
as
I
arrive
at
Madrid
,
I
make
it
my
business
to
enquire
out
,
and
wait
upon
Father
Fahy
,
Chief
of
the
Irish
College
.
<EOS>
He
receive
me
very
courteously
;
but
when
I
acquaint
him
with
the
Treatment
I
have
meet
with
from
Brennan
,
and
have
give
him
an
Account
of
his
other
scandalous
Behaviour
<EOS>
,
I
find
he
be
no
Stranger
to
the
man
,
or
his
Character
;
<EOS>
for
he
soon
confirm'd
<EOS>
to
me
the
Honour
<EOS>
Brennan
first
boast
of
,
his
considerable
family
,
by
say
,
that
scarce
an
Assize
pass
in
his
own
Country
,
without
two
or
three
of
that
name
receive
at
the
gallow
the
just
reward
of
their
Demerits
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
not
only
Father
Fahy
,
but
all
the
Clergy
of
that
nation
at
Madrid
,
readily
subscribe
to
this
character
of
him
,
that
he
be
a
scandal
to
their
Country
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
I
have
nothing
more
to
do
,
but
to
get
that
Father
to
go
with
me
to
Pedro
de
Dios
,
who
be
the
Head
of
the
Dominican
Cloyster
,
and
Dean
of
the
Inquisition
.
<EOS>
He
readily
grant
my
request
,
and
when
we
come
there
,
in
a
Manner
unexpected
,
represent
to
the
Dean
,
that
have
some
good
disposition
towards
Mother
-
Church
,
I
have
be
divert
from
them
,
he
fear
,
by
the
evil
Practices
of
one
Murtough
Brennan
,
a
Countryman
of
his
,
tho
'
a
scandal
to
his
Country
;
that
under
a
Pretence
of
seek
my
conversion
,
he
have
lay'd
himself
open
in
a
most
beastly
Manner
,
such
as
would
have
set
a
Catholick
into
a
vile
opinion
of
their
religion
,
and
much
more
one
that
be
yet
a
Heretick
.
<EOS>
the
Dean
have
hardly
Patience
to
hear
Particulars
;
but
as
soon
as
my
friend
have
end
his
narration
,
he
immediately
give
his
order
,
prohibit
Murtough
's
say
any
more
Masses
,
either
in
Madrid
,
or
any
other
Place
in
Spain
.
<EOS>
this
indeed
be
take
away
the
poor
Wretches
sole
Subsistence
,
and
put
him
just
upon
an
equality
with
his
Demerits
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
the
same
opportunity
to
make
my
complaint
of
the
Corrigidor
;
but
his
Term
expire
very
soon
,
and
a
process
be
likely
to
be
chargeable
<EOS>
,
I
be
advise
to
let
it
drop
.
<EOS>
so
have
effect
what
I
come
for
,
I
return
to
my
old
Station
at
la
Mancha
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
back
,
I
find
a
new
Corrigidor
,
as
I
have
be
tell
there
would
,
by
the
Dean
of
the
Inquisition
,
who
,
at
the
same
Time
,
advise
me
to
wait
on
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
soon
after
my
arrival
,
and
then
experience
the
advice
to
be
well
intend
;
the
Dean
have
write
a
letter
to
him
,
to
order
him
to
treat
me
with
all
Manner
of
Civility
.
<EOS>
He
show'd
me
<EOS>
the
very
letter
,
and
<EOS>
it
be
in
such
particular
and
obliging
term
,
that
I
could
not
but
perceive
he
have
take
a
Resolution
,
if
possible
,
to
eradicate
all
the
evil
impression
,
that
Murtough
's
Behaviour
may
have
give
too
great
Occasion
for
.
<EOS>
this
serv'd
to
confirm
me
in
an
Observation
that
I
have
long
before
make
,
that
a
Protestant
,
who
will
prudently
keep
his
sentiment
in
his
own
Breast
,
may
command
any
Thing
in
Spain
;
where
their
stiff
Bigotry
lead
'em
naturally
into
that
other
Mistake
,
that
not
to
oppose
,
be
to
assent
.
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
generally
among
them
,
almost
a
work
of
supererogation
to
be
even
instrumental
in
the
Conversion
of
one
they
call
a
Heretick
.
<EOS>
to
bring
any
such
back
to
what
they
call
Mother
Church
,
nothing
shall
be
spar'd
,
nothing
think
too
much
:
<EOS>
and
if
you
have
Insincerity
enough
to
give
them
hope
,
you
shall
not
only
live
in
Ease
,
but
in
Pleasure
and
Plenty
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
entertain'd
some
thought
on
my
Journey
back
,
of
take
up
my
old
quarter
at
the
Widow
's
;
but
find
her
so
intirely
convert
by
her
Clerico
,
that
there
wou'd
be
no
room
to
expect
peace
:
<EOS>
for
which
Reason
,
with
the
help
of
my
fair
Vicinos
,
and
Don
Felix
,
I
take
another
,
where
I
have
not
be
long
,
before
I
receive
an
unhappy
Account
of
Murtough
's
Conduct
in
Murcia
.
<EOS>
It
seem
he
have
keep
his
resolution
in
go
thither
;
where
meet
with
some
of
his
own
Countrymen
,
though
he
find
'em
<EOS>
stanch
good
Catholics
<EOS>
,
he
so
far
inveigle
himself
into
'em
,
that
he
bring
them
all
into
a
foul
chance
for
their
life
.
<EOS>
there
be
three
of
'em
,
all
Soldiers
,
in
a
spanish
Regiment
,
but
in
a
fit
of
ambitious
,
though
frantick
,
zeal
:
<EOS>
Murtough
have
wheedle
them
to
go
along
with
him
to
Pedro
de
Dios
,
Dean
of
the
Inquisition
,
to
declare
and
acknowledge
before
him
,
that
they
be
convert
and
bring
over
to
Mother
Church
,
and
by
him
only
.
<EOS>
the
poor
ignorant
,
thus
intic'd
,
have
leave
their
Regiment
,
of
which
the
Colonel
,
have
notice
,
send
after
them
,
and
they
be
overtake
on
the
Road
,
their
Missionair
with
them
.
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
all
his
Oratory
,
nay
,
even
the
Discovery
of
the
whole
Farce
,
one
of
them
be
hang'd
for
an
Example
to
the
other
two
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
after
my
Return
before
news
arriv'd
of
the
peace
;
which
though
they
receiv'd
with
Joy
,
they
could
hardly
entertain
with
Belief
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
the
new
Corrigidor
,
with
whom
I
hold
a
well
correspondence
than
I
have
do
with
the
old
one
,
desire
me
to
produce
my
letter
from
England
,
that
it
be
true
.
<EOS>
never
do
People
give
great
demonstration
of
Joy
,
than
they
upon
this
Occasion
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
common
cry
in
the
Streets
,
Paz
con
Angleterra
,
con
todo
Mundo
Guerra
;
and
my
confirmation
do
them
as
much
Pleasure
as
it
do
Service
to
me
;
for
be
possible
,
they
treat
me
with
more
civility
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
peace
soon
after
be
proclaim
,
I
receive
order
to
repair
to
Madrid
,
where
the
rest
of
the
Prisoners
take
at
Denia
have
be
carry
;
when
I
,
by
reason
of
my
Wounds
,
and
want
of
Health
,
have
be
leave
behind
.
<EOS>
other
I
understand
lie
ready
,
and
some
be
on
their
March
to
Bayone
in
France
;
where
ship
be
order
for
their
transportation
into
England
.
<EOS>
so
after
a
Residence
of
three
year
and
three
month
;
have
take
leave
of
all
my
Acquaintance
,
I
leave
a
Place
,
that
be
almost
become
natural
to
me
,
the
delicious
Sainte
Clemente
de
la
Mancha
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
of
Moment
,
or
worth
observe
,
meet
I
with
,
till
I
come
near
Ocanna
;
and
there
occur
a
Sight
ridiculous
enough
.
<EOS>
the
Knight
of
the
Town
,
I
last
come
from
,
the
ever
renown'd
Don
Quixot
,
never
make
such
a
figure
as
a
Spaniard
,
I
there
meet
on
the
Road
.
<EOS>
He
be
mount
on
a
Mule
of
the
large
size
,
and
yet
no
way
unsizeable
to
his
person
:
He
have
two
Pistols
in
his
holster
,
and
one
on
each
side
stick
in
his
Belt
;
a
sort
of
large
Blunderbuss
in
one
of
his
Hands
,
and
the
fellow
to
it
sling
over
his
Shoulders
<EOS>
hang
at
his
back
.
<EOS>
all
these
be
accompany'd
with
a
right
Spanish
Spado
,
and
an
Attendant
Stiletto
,
in
their
customary
position
.
<EOS>
the
Muletier
that
be
my
guide
,
call
out
to
him
in
Spanish
,
tell
him
he
be
very
well
arm'd
;
to
which
,
with
a
great
deal
of
Gravity
,
the
Don
return
Answer
,
by
Saint
Jago
<EOS>
a
Man
can
not
be
too
well
arm'd
in
such
dangerous
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
up
my
quarter
that
Night
at
Ocanna
,
a
large
,
neat
,
and
well
build
Town
.
<EOS>
house
of
good
reception
,
and
Entertainment
,
be
very
scarce
all
over
Spain
;
but
that
,
where
I
then
lie
,
may
have
pass'd
for
good
in
any
other
Country
.
<EOS>
yet
it
give
me
a
Notion
quite
different
to
what
I
find
:
for
I
imagine
it
to
proceed
from
my
near
Approach
to
the
capital
.
<EOS>
but
instead
of
that
,
contrary
to
all
other
Countries
,
the
nearer
I
come
to
Madrid
,
the
Houses
of
Entertainment
grow
bad
and
bad
;
not
in
their
rate
do
I
mean
(
for
that
with
Reason
enough
may
have
be
expect
)
but
even
in
their
provision
,
and
place
and
way
of
Reception
,
I
could
not
however
forbear
smile
at
the
reason
give
by
my
Muletier
,
that
it
proceed
from
a
piece
of
Court
Policy
,
in
order
to
oblige
all
traveller
to
hasten
to
Madrid
.
  
<EOS>
two
small
Leagues
from
Ocanna
<EOS>
we
arrive
at
Aranjuez
,
a
Seat
of
Pleasure
,
which
the
king
of
Spain
commonly
select
for
their
place
of
Residence
during
the
month
of
April
and
<EOS>
May
It
be
distant
from
Madrid
about
seven
league
;
and
the
Country
round
be
the
pleasantest
in
all
Spain
,
Valencia
except
.
<EOS>
the
House
it
self
make
but
a
very
indifferent
appearance
;
I
have
see
many
a
well
in
England
,
with
an
owner
to
it
of
no
more
than
five
hundred
Pounds
per
Annum
;
yet
the
Gardens
be
large
and
fine
;
or
as
the
Spaniards
say
,
the
fine
in
all
Spain
,
which
with
them
be
all
the
World
.
<EOS>
They
tell
you
at
the
same
time
,
that
those
of
Versailles
,
in
their
most
beautiful
part
,
take
their
model
from
these
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
those
at
Versailles
:
<EOS>
but
in
my
opinion
,
the
Walks
at
Aranjuez
,
tho
'
noble
in
their
length
,
lose
much
of
their
beauty
by
their
Narrowness
.
  
<EOS>
the
Water
-
work
here
be
a
great
curiosity
;
to
which
the
River
Tagus
run
along
close
by
,
do
mightily
contribute
.
<EOS>
that
River
be
let
into
the
Gardens
by
a
vast
number
of
little
Canals
,
which
with
their
pleasing
Maeanders
divert
the
Eye
with
inexpressible
delight
.
<EOS>
these
pretty
Wanderers
by
Pipes
properly
plac'd
<EOS>
in
them
,
afford
variety
scarce
to
be
believ'd
or
imagin'd
;
and
which
would
be
grateful
in
any
climate
;
but
much
more
,
where
the
air
,
as
it
do
here
,
want
in
the
Summer
Months
perpetual
cooling
.
  
<EOS>
to
see
a
spread
tree
,
as
grow
in
its
natural
soil
,
distinguish'd
from
its
pine
neighbourhood
by
a
gentle
refreshing
shower
,
which
appear
softly
distil
from
every
Branch
and
Leaf
thereof
,
while
Nature
all
around
be
smile
,
without
one
liquid
sign
of
sorrow
,
to
me
appear'd
<EOS>
surprizingly
pleasing
.
<EOS>
and
the
more
when
I
observ'd
<EOS>
that
its
Neighbours
receiv'd
<EOS>
not
any
the
least
benefit
of
that
plentiful
Effusion
;
and
yet
a
very
few
tree
distant
,
you
should
find
a
dozen
together
under
the
same
healthful
Sudor
.
<EOS>
where
art
imitate
nature
well
,
philosopher
hold
it
a
perfection
:
then
what
must
she
exact
of
us
,
where
we
find
her
transcendent
in
the
Perfections
of
Nature
?
  
<EOS>
the
watry
Arch
be
nothing
less
surprizing
;
where
art
contend
with
Nature
,
act
against
the
Laws
of
Nature
,
and
yet
be
beautiful
.
<EOS>
to
see
a
Liquid
Stream
vault
it
self
from
the
space
of
threescore
Yards
into
a
perfect
Semi
-
Orb
,
will
be
grant
by
the
curious
to
be
rare
and
strange
:
<EOS>
but
sure
to
walk
beneath
that
Arch
,
and
see
the
Waters
flow
over
your
Head
,
without
your
receive
the
minute
drop

be
strange

if
not
strange
enough

stagger
all
Belief

<EOS>
the
Story
of
Actaeon
,
pictur'd
<EOS>
in
Water
Colours
,
if
I
may
so
express
my
self
,
tho
'
pretty
,
seem'd
to
me
,
but
trifle
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
those
seem'd
to
be
like
Nature
miraculously
display
;
this
only
Fable
in
Grotesque
.
<EOS>
the
figure
indeed
be
not
only
fine
,
but
extraordinary
;
yet
their
various
Shapes
be
not
at
all
so
entertaining
to
the
Mind
,
however
refresh
they
may
be
find
to
the
Body
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
notice
before
of
the
straitness
of
their
Walks
:
<EOS>
but
tho
'
to
me
it
may
seem
a
diminution
of
their
Beauty
<EOS>
:
I
be
apt
to
believe
to
the
Spaniard
,
for
and
by
whom
they
be
lay
out
,
it
may
seem
otherwise
.
<EOS>
They
,
of
both
Sexes
,
give
themselves
so
intolerably
up
to
Amouring
,
that
on
that
account
the
Closeness
of
the
Walks
may
be
look'd
<EOS>
upon
as
an
Advantage
rather
than
a
Defect
.
<EOS>
the
grand
Avenue
to
the
House
be
much
more
stately
,
and
compos'd
as
they
be
,
of
row
of
tree
,
somewhat
large
than
our
large
Limes
,
whose
leave
be
all
of
a
perfect
Pea
bloom
Colour
,
together
with
their
Grandeur
,
they
strike
the
Eye
with
a
pleasing
Beauty
.
<EOS>
at
the
Entrance
of
the
Grand
Court
we
see
the
Statue
of
Philip
the
Second
;
to
intimate
to
the
Spectators
,
I
suppose
,
that
he
be
the
Founder
.
  
<EOS>
among
other
Parks
about
Aranjuez
there
be
one
intirely
preserve
for
dromedary
;
an
useful
Creature
for
Fatigue
,
Burden
,
and
Dispatch
;
but
the
near
of
kin
to
Deformity
of
any
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
there
be
several
other
enclosure
for
several
sort
of
strange

wild
beast

which
be
sometimes
bait
in
a
very
large
Pond
<EOS>
,
that
be
show
me
about
half
a
League
from

<EOS>
this
be
no
ordinary
diversion

when
the

that
way

the
Beast
,

whether
Bear

Lyon

way
issue

by
a
Door
over

Pond
by
a

the
Dogs
stand
ready

engage
him

a
Diversion
less
to
be
complain'd
of
than
their
tauridore
;
because
attend
with
less
Cruelty
to
the
Beast
,
as
well
as
Danger
to
the
Spectators
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
Madrid
,
a
Town
much
spoken
of
by
Natives
,
as
well
as
Strangers
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
have
see
it
before
,
I
could
hardly
restrain
my
self
from
be
surprize
to
find
it
<EOS>
only
environ'd
with
Mud
wall
.
<EOS>
It
may
very
easily
be
imagin'd
,
they
be
never
intend
for
Defence
,
and
yet
it
be
a
long
time
before
I
could
find
any
other
use
,
or
rather
any
use
at
all
in
'em
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
be
at
last
convinc'd
of
my
error
by
a
sensible
increase
of
expence
.
<EOS>
without
the
Gates
,
to
half
a
League
without
the
Town
,
you
have
Wine
for
two
penny
the
Quart
;
but
within
the
place
,
you
drink
it
little
cheap
than
you
may
in
London
.
<EOS>
the
Mud
wall
therefore
well
enough
answer
their
intent
of
force
People
to
reside
there
,
under
pretence
of
security
;
but
in
reality
to
be
tax'd
,
for
other
thing
be
taxable
,
as
well
as
Wine
,
tho
"
not
in
like
proportion
.
  
<EOS>
all
Embassadors
have
a
Claim
or
Privilege
,
of
bring
in
what
wine
<EOS>
they
please
tax
-
free
;
and
the
King
,
to
wave
it
,
<EOS>
will
at
any
Time
purchase
that
Exemption
of
Duty
at
the
price
of
five
hundred
Pistoles
per
Annum
.
<EOS>
the
Convents
and
Nunneries
be
allow
a
like
licence
of
free
importation
;
and
it
be
one
of
the
first
Advantages
they
can
boast
of
;
for
,
under
that
licence
have
a
liberty
of
set
up
a
Tavern
near
them
,
they
make
a
prodigious
advantage
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
Wine
drink
and
sell
in
this
place
,
be
for
the
most
part
a
sort
of
white
Wine
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
the
Mud
Walls
give
me
at
first
but
a
faint
idea
of
the
place
;
I
be
pleasingly
disappointed
,
as
soon
as
I
enter'd
the
Gates
.
<EOS>
the
Town
then
show'd
<EOS>
itself
well
build
,
and
of
Brick
,
and
the
street
wide
,
long
,
and
spacious
.
<EOS>
those
of
Atocha
,
and
Alcala
,
be
as
fine
as
any
I
ever
see
;
yet
be
it
situate
but
very
indifferently
:
for
tho
'
they
have
what
they
call
a
River
,
to
which
they
give
the
very
fair
name
of
la
Mansuera
,
and
over
which
they
have
build
a
curious
,
long
,
and
large
Stone
Bridge
;
yet
be
the
course
of
it
,
in
Summer
time
especially
,
mostly
dry
.
<EOS>
this
give
occasion
to
that
piece
of
Railery
of
a
Foreign
Embassador
,
that
the
King
would
have
don
wisely
to
have
buy
a
River
,
before
he
build
the
Bridge
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
that
little
Stream
of
a
River
which
they
boast
of
,
they
improve
as
much
as
possible
;
since
down
the
side
,
as
far
as
you
can
see
,
there
be
coop
,
or
little
place
hoop
in
,
for
People
to
wash
their
linen
(
for
they
very
rarely
wash
in
their
own
Houses
)
nor
be
it
really
an
unplease
Sight
,
to
view
the
regular
row
of
them
at
that
cleanly
Operation
.
  
<EOS>
the
King
have
here
two
palace
;
one
within
the
Town
,
the
other
near
adjoin
.
<EOS>
that
in
the
Town
be
build
of
Stone
,
the
other
which
be
call
Bueno
Retiro
,
be
all
of
Brick
.
<EOS>
from
the
Town
to
this
last
,
in
Summer
time
,
there
be
a
large
covering
of
Canvas
,
propt
up
with
tall
Poles
;
under
which
People
walk
to
avoid
the
scorching
heat
of
the
Sun
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
be
pass
by
the
Chapel
of
the
Carmelites
,
I
see
several
blind
Men
,
some
lead
,
some
grope
the
way
with
their
stick
,
go
into
the
Chapel
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
curiosity
to
know
the
reason
;
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
enter'd
the
Door
,
but
be
surprize
to
see
such
a
number
of
those
unfortunate
People
,
all
kneel
before
the
Altar
,
some
kiss
the
ground
,
other
hold
up
their
head
,
cry
out
Misericordia
.
<EOS>
I
be
inform
'
twas
Saint
Lucy
's
day
,
the
patroness
of
the
Blind
;
therefore
all
who
be
able
,
come
upon
that
day
to
pay
their
devotion
:
<EOS>
so
I
leave
them
,
and
direct
my
course
towards
the
King
's
Palace
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
the
outward
Court
,
I
meet
with
a
Spanish
Gentleman
of
my
Acquaintance
,
and
we
go
into
the
Piazza
's
;
whilst
we
be
talk
there
,
I
see
several
gentleman
pass
by
have
badge
on
their
breast
;
some
white
,
some
red
,
and
other
green
:
<EOS>
My
friend
inform
me
that
there
be
five
order
of
Knighthood
in
Spain
.
<EOS>
that

Gentlemen

<EOS>
that

<EOS>
He
likewise
tell
me
,
that
there
be
above
ninety
place
of
Grandees
,
but
never
fill
up
;
who
have
the
Privilege
of
be
cover'd
in
the
Presence
of
the
King
,
and
be
distinguish
into
three
rank
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
of
those
who
cover
themselves
before
they
speak
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
the
second
be
those
who
put
on
their
hat
after
they
have
begin
to
speak
.
<EOS>
the
third
be
those
who
only
put
on
their
hat
,
have
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
Ladies
of
the
Grandees
have
also
great
respect
show'd
them
.
<EOS>
the
Queen
rise
up
when
they
enter
the
Chamber
,
and
offer
them
Cushions
.
  
<EOS>
no
married
man
except
the
King

in
the
Palace
,
for
all
the
woman
who
live
there
<EOS>
be
widow
,
or
Maids
of
Honour
to
the
Queen
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
Prince
of
Asturia
's
Dinner
carry
through
the
Court
up
to
him
,
be
guard
by
four
gentleman
of
the
Guards
,
one

,
another
behind
,
and
one

shoulder'd
;
the
Queen
's
come
next
,
and
the
King
be
the
last
,
guard
as
before
,
for
they
always
dine
separately
.
<EOS>
I
observe
that
the
gentleman
of
the
Guards
,
though
not
on
Duty
,
yet
they
be
oblige
to
wear
their
Carbine
Belts

by
his
Sanctity

the
Title

Saint

be
the
Patron

Polygamy

<EOS>
Most
People
believe
that
the
King
's
great
revenue
consist
in
the
Gold
and
Silver
bring
from
the
West
Indies
(
which
be
a
mistake
)
for
most
part
of
that
Wealth
belong
to
merchant
and
other
,
that
pay
the
Workmen
at
the
Golden
Mines
of
Potosi
,
and
the
Silver
Mines
at
Mexico
;
yet
the
King
,
as
I
have
be
inform
,
receive
about
a
million
and
a
half
of
gold
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spaniards
have
a
saying
,
that
the
fine
Garden
of
Fruit
in
Spain
be
in
the
middle
of
Madrid
,
which
be
the
Plaza
or
Market
Place
,
and
truly
the
stall
there
be
set
forth
with
such
variety
of
delicious
fruit
,
<EOS>
that
I
must
confess
I
never
see
any
place
comparable
to
it
;
and
which
add
to
my
Admiration
,
there
be
no
Gardens
or
Orchards
of
Fruit
within
some
league
.
  
<EOS>
They
seldom
eat
hare
in
Spain
but
whilst
the
grape
be
grow
,
and
then
they
be
so
exceed
fat
,
they
be
knock
down
with
stick
.
<EOS>
Their
rabit
be
not
so
good
as
our
in
England
;
they
have
great
plenty
of
Patridges
,
which
be
large
and
fine
feather'd
than
our
.
<EOS>
They
have
but
little
Beef
in
Spain
,
because
there
be
no
grass
,
but
they
have
plenty
of
Mutton
,
and
exceed
good
,
because
their
sheep
feed
only
upon
wild
Potherbs
;
their
pork
be
delicious
,
<EOS>
their
hog
feed
only
upon
chestnut
and
Acorns

<EOS>
MADRID

,
though
great

<EOS>
in
the
latter
Philip

by
the
persuasion
of
parson
an
English
Jesuit
,
erect
an
English
Seminary
;
and
Philip
the
Fourth
build
a
most
noble
Palace
,
with
extraordinary
fine
Gardens
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
Christopher
Columbus
,
who
first
discover'd
<EOS>
the
West
Indies
,
dye
there
,
tho
'
I
have
hear
he
lie
bury

and
have
a
Monument
at
Sevil

<EOS>
the

stand
upon
eleven
arch
,
under
every
one
of
which
there
be
Shops
,
which
degrade
it
to
a

Exchange
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
the
Stairs
by
which
you
ascend
up
to
the
Guard
Room
(
which
be
very
spacious
too
)
be
stately
,
large
,
and
curious
.
<EOS>
so
soon
as
you
have
pass'd
the
Guard
Room
,
you
enter
into
a
long
and
noble
Gallery
,
the
right
Hand
whereof
lead
to
the
King

Apartment
,
the
left

<EOS>
entre
into

you

his
Levee

on
one
side
whereof
(
for
it
take
up
the
whole
side

be
paint
the
fatal
Battle
of
Almanza
.
<EOS>
I
confess
the
View
somewhat
affect
me
,
tho
'
so
long
after
;
and
bring
to
mind
many
old
passage
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
reflection
conclude
thus
in
favour
of
the
Spaniard
,
that
we
ought
to
excuse
their
vanity
in
so
expose
under
a
French
General
,
a
Victory
,
which
be
the
only
material
one
the
Spaniards
could
ever
boast
of
over
an
English
Army
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
State
Room
,
when
the
King
first
appear

every
person
present

receive
him
with
a
profound
homage

after
which
turn
from

Velvet
Chair

by
which
stand

purpose

<EOS>
He
receive
every

a
seem
Complaisance

with
an
air
more
resemble
the

the
Spanish
Ceremony

<EOS>
petition
to
the
King
,
as
with
us
,
be
deliver
into
the
Hands
of
the
Secretary
of
State
:
<EOS>
yet
in
one
particular
they
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
worthy
the
Imitation
of
other
Courts
;
the
Petitioner
be
directly
tell
,
what
Day
he
must
come
for
an

at

<EOS>
I
can
not
here
omit
an
accidental
Conversation
,
that
pass'd
between
General
Mahoni
and
my
self
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
after
some
talk
of
the
Bravery
of
the
English
Nation
,
he
make
mention
of
General
Stanhope
,
with
a
very
peculiar
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
never
be
so
put
to
the
Nonplus
in
all
my
day
,
as
that
General
once
put
me
in
.
<EOS>
I
be
on
the
road
from
Paris
to
Madrid
,
and
have
notice
,
that
that
General
be
go
just
the
Reverse
,
and
that
in
all
likelyhood
we
should
meet
the
next
day
:
before
my
setting
out
in
the
morning
,
I
take
care
to
order
my
gay
Regimental
apparel
,
resolve
to
make
the
good
appearance
I
could
to
receive
so
great
a
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
not
travell'd
above
four
hour
before
I
see
two
gentleman
,
who
appear
to
be
English
,
it
induc'd
<EOS>
me
to
imagine
they
be
Forerunners
,
and
<EOS>
some
of
his
Retinue
.
<EOS>
but
how
abash'd
and
confound
be
I
?
<EOS>
when
put
the
Question
to
one
of
'em
,
he
make
answer
,
Sir
,
I
be
the
person
.
<EOS>
never
do
Moderation
put
vanity
more
out
of
countenance
:
<EOS>
tho
"
to
say
Truth
,
I
cou'd
not
but
think
his
Dress
as
much
too
plain
for
General
Stanhope
,
as
I
at
that
juncture
think
my
own
too
gay
for
Mahoni
.
<EOS>
but
,
"
add
he
,
"
that
great
Man
have
too
many
inward
great
endowment
to
stand
in
need
of
any
outside
decoration
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
of
all
diversion
the
King
take
most
delight
in
that
of
Shooting
,
which
he
perform
with
great
Exactness
and
Dexterity
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
him
divert
himself
at
Swallow
shooting
(
by
all
,
I
think
allow'd
to
be
the
most
difficult
)
and
exceed
all
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
the
last
time
I
have
the
Honour
to
see
him
,
be
on
his
return
from
that
exercise
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
abroad
with
the
Duke
of
Medina
Sidonia
,
and
alight
out
of
his
Coach
at
a
back
Door
of
the
Palace
,
with
three
or
four
bird
in
his
Hand
,
which
accord
to
his
usual
Custom
,
he
carry
up
to
the
Queen
with
his
own
hand
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
play
-
house
in
Madrid
,
at
both
which
they
act
every
day
;
but
their
actor
,
and
their
music
,
be
almost
too
indifferent
to
be
mention
.
<EOS>
the
Theatre
at
the
Bueno
Retiro
be
much
the
good
;
but
as
much
inferior
to
our
at
London
,
as
those
at
Madrid
be
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
one
play
,
when
both
King
and
Queen
be
present
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
splendid
Audience
,
and
a
great
concourse
of
Ladies
;
but
the
latter
,
as
be
the
Custom
there
,
have
lattice
before
them
,
the
appearance
lose
most
of
its
Lustre
.
<EOS>
one
very
remarkable
thing
happen'd
,
while
I
be
there
;
the
Ave
-
Bell
ring
in
the
Middle
of
an
Act
,
when
down
on
their
knee
fall
every
body
,
even
the
Players
on
the
stage
,
in
the
middle
of
their
harangue
.
<EOS>
They
remain
for
some
time
at
their
devotion
;
then
up
they
rise
,
and
return
to
the
business
they
be
before
engag'd
in
,
begin
where
they
leave
off
.
  
<EOS>
the
Ladies
of
Quality
make
their
visit
in
grand
State
and
Decorum
.
<EOS>
the
Lady
Visitant
be
carry'd
in
a
Chair
by
four
man
;
the
two
first
,
in
all
Weathers
,
always
bare
.
<EOS>
two
other
walk
as
a
Guard
,
one
on
each
side
;
another
carry
a
large
Lanthorn
for
fear
of
be
benight
;
then
follow
a
Coach
draw
by
six
mule
,
with
her
Women
,
and
after
that
another
with
her
gentleman
;
several
servant
walk
after
,
more
or
less
,
accord
to
the
Quality
of
the
person
.
<EOS>
They
never
suffer
their
servant
to
over
load
a
Coach
,
as
be
frequently
see
with
us
,
neither
do
Coachmen
or
Chairmen
go
or
drive
as
if
they
carry
Midwives
in
lieu
of
Ladies
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
they
affect
a
motion
so
slow
and
so
stately
,
that
you
would
rather
imagine
the
Ladies
be
every
one
of
them
near
their
time
,
and
very
apprehensive
of
a
Miscarriage
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
not
to
have
see
here
any
horse
in
any
Coach
,
but
in
the
King
's
,
or
an
Embassador
's
;
which
can
only
proceed
from
Custom
;
for
certainly
fine
horse
be
not
to
be
find
in
the
World
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
time
of
my
being
here
,
Cardinal
Giudici
be
at
Madrid
;
he
be
a
tall
,
proper
,
comely
man
,
and
one
that
make
the
good
appearance
.
<EOS>
Alberoni
be
there
at
the
same
time
,
who
,
upon
the
death
of
the
Duke
of
Vendome
,
have
the
good
Fortune
to
find
the
Princess
Ursini
his
Patroness
.
<EOS>
an
instance
of
whose
Ingratitude
will
plead
Pardon
for
this
little
digression
.
<EOS>
that
Princess
first
bring
Alberoni
into
Favour
at
Court
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
of
Italy
,
and
that
may
be
one
reason
of
that
Lady
's
espouse
his
interest
:
tho
'
<EOS>
some
there
be
,
that
assign
it
to
the
Recommendation
of
the
Duke
of
Vendome
;
with
whom
Alberoni
have
the
Honour
to
be
very
intimate
,
as
the
other
be
always
distinguish'd
<EOS>
by
that
Princess
.
<EOS>
be
which
it
will
,
certain
it
be
,
she
be
Alberoni
's
first
,
and
sole
patroness
;
which
give
many
People
afterwards
a
very
smart
Occasion
of
reflect
upon
him
,
both
as
to
his
Integrity
and
Gratitude
.
<EOS>
for
,
when
Alberoni
,
upon
the
death
of
King
Philip
's
first
Queen
,
have
recommend
this
present
Lady
,
who
be
his
Countrywoman
,
(
she
of
Parma
,
and
he
of
Placentia
,
both
in
the
same
Dukedom
)
and
have
forward
her
match
with
the
King
,
with
all
possible
assiduity
;
and
when
that
Princess
,
pursuant
to
the
Orders
she
have
receive
from
the
King
,
pass
over
into
Italy
to
accompany
the
Queen
Elect
into
her
own
dominion
;
Alberoni
,
forgetful
of
the
Hand
that
first
advance
him
,
send
a
letter
to
the
present
Queen
,
just
before
her
landing
,
that
if
she
resolve
to
be
Queen
of
Spain
,
she
must
banish
the
Princess
Ursini
,
her
companion
,
and
never
let
her
come
to
Court
.
<EOS>
accordingly
that
Lady
,
to
evince
the
Extent
of
her
Power
,
and
the
Strength
of
her
Resolution
,
dipatch'd
<EOS>
that
Princess
away
,
on
her
very
landing
,
and
before
she
have
see
the
King
,
under
a
Detachment
of
her
own
Guards
,
into
France
;
and
all
this
without
either
allow
her
an
opportunity
of
justify
her
self
,
or
assign
the
least
reason
for
so
uncommon
an
Action
.
<EOS>
but
the
same
Alberoni
(
though
afterwards
create
Cardinal
,
and
for
some
Time
King
Philip
's
Prime
Minion
)
soon
see
that
Ingratitude
of
his
reward
in
his
own
Disgrace
,
at
the
very
same
Court
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
,
when
at
la
Mancha
,
Don
Felix
Pachero
,
in
a
conversation
there
,
maintain'd
,
that
three
Women
,
at
that
Time
,
rul'd
the
World
,
viz
.
<EOS>
Queen
Anne
,
Madam
Mantenon
,
and
this
Princess
Ursini
.
  
<EOS>
Father
Fahy
's
Civilities
,
when
last
at
Madrid
,
exact
of
me
some
suitable
Acknowledgment
,
I
go
to
pay
him
a
visit
;
as
to
render
him
due
thank
for
the
past
,
so
to
give
him
a
further
Account
of
his
Countryman
Brennan
;
but
I
soon
find
he
do
not
much
incline
to
hear
any
thing
more
of
Murtough
,
not
expect
to
hear
any
good
of
him
;
for
which
Reason
,
as
soon
as
I
well
could
,
I
change
the
Conversation
to
another
Topick
.
<EOS>
in
which
some
Word
dropping
of
the
Count
de
Montery
,
I
tell
him
,
that
I
hear
he
have
take
Orders
,
and
officiate
at
Mass
:
<EOS>
He
make
answer
,
it
be
all
very
true
.
<EOS>
and
upon
my
intimating
,
that
I
have
the
Honour
to
serve
under
him
in
flander
,
on
my
first
entre
into
Service
,
and
when
he
command
the
spanish
Forces
at
the
famous
Battle
of
Seneff
;
and
add
,
that
I
could
not
but
be
surprize
,
that
he
,
who
be
then
one
of
the
bright
cavalieroe
of
the
Age
,
should
now
be
in
Orders
;
and
that
I
should
look
upon
it
as
a
mighty
Favour
barely
to
have
,
if
it
may
be
,
a
view
of
him
;
he
very
obligingly
tell
me
,
that
he
be
very
well
acquaint
with
him
,
and
that
if
I
would
come
the
next
day
,
he
would
not
fail
to
accompany
me
to
the
Count
's
House
.
  
<EOS>
punctually
at
the
time
appoint
,
I
wait
on
Father
Fahy
,
who
,
as
he
promise
,
carry'd
me
to
the
Count
's
house
:
He
be
step
into
his
Coach
just
as
we
get
there
;
but
see
Father
Fahy
,
he
advance
towards
us
.
<EOS>
the
Father
deliver'd
<EOS>
my
Desire
in
as
handsom
a
manner
as
could
be
,
and
conclude
with
the
Reason
of
it
,
from
my
have
be
in
that
service
under
him
;
he
seem'd
<EOS>
very
well
pleas'd
,
but
add
,
that
there
be
not
many
beside
my
self
live
,
who
have
be
in
that
service
with
him
.
<EOS>
after
some
other
Conversation
,
he
call'd
his
Gentleman
to
him
,
and
give
him
particular
Orders
to
give
us
a
Frescari
,
or
in
English
,
an
Entertainment
;
so
<EOS>
take
leave
,
he
go
into
his
Coach
,
and
we
to
our
Frescari
.
  
<EOS>
come
from
which
,
Father
Fahi
make
me
observe
,
in
the
open
Street
,
a
Stone
,
on
which
be
a
visible
great
Stain
of
somewhat
reddish
and
like
blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
occasion'd
<EOS>
by
the
death
of
a
Countryman
of
mine
,
who
have
the
Misfortune
to
overset
a
Child
,
come
out
of
that
House
(
point
to
one
opposite
to
us
)
<EOS>
the
Child
fright
,
though
not
hurt
,
as
be
natural
,
make
a
terrible
Outcry
;
upon
which
its
Father
come
out
in
a
violent
rage
(
notwithstanding
my
Countryman
beg'd
Pardon
,
and
plead
Sorrow
as
be
only
an
Accident
)
<EOS>
stabb'd
him
to
the
Heart
,
and
down
he
fall
upon
that
Stone
,
which
to
this
day
retain
the
Mark
of
innocent
blood
,
so
rashly
shed
"
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
on
,
and
tell
me
,
the
Spaniard
immediately
take
Sanctuary
in
the
Church
,
whence
some
Time
after
he
make
his
Escape
.
<EOS>
but
escape
of
that
nature
be
so
common
in
Spain
,
that
they
be
not
worth
wonder
at
.
<EOS>
for
even
though
it
be
for
wilful
and
premeditate
murder
,
if
the
Murderer
have
take
Sanctuary
,
it
be
never
know
,
that
he
be
deliver
up
to
Justice
,
though
demand
;
but
in
some
disguise
he
make
his
escape
,
or
some
way
be
secure
against
all
the
Clamours
of
Power
or
Equity
.
<EOS>
I
have
observe
,
that
some
of
the
great
quality
stop
their
coach
over
a
stink
nasty
Puddle
,
which
they
often
find
in
the
Streets
,
and
hold
their
head
over
the
Door
,
snuff
up
the
nasty
Scent
which
ascend
,
believe
that
'
tis
extream
healthful
;
when
I
be
force
to
hold
my
nose
,
pass
by
.
'
<EOS>
tis
not
convenient
to
walk
out
early
in
the
morning
,
they
have
no
necessary
Houses
,
throw
out
their
Nastiness
in
the
middle
of
the
Street
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
take
Leave
of
Father
Fahy
,
and
return'd
<EOS>
my
thank
for
all
civility
,
I
go
to
pay
a
visit
to
Mr.
Salter
,
who
be
Secretary
to
General
Stanhope
,
when
the
English
Forces
be
make
Prisoners
of
War
at
Breuhiga
;
go
up
Stairs
<EOS>
,
I
find
the
Door
of
his
lodging
a
-
jar
;
and
knocking
,
a
person
come
to
the
Door
,
who
appear
under
some
Surprize
at
Sight
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
him
,
but
inquire
if
Mr.
Salter
be
within
;
He
answer
,
as
I
fancy'd
,
with
some
Hesitation
,
that
he
be
but
be
busy
in
an
inner
Room
.
<EOS>
however
,
though
unask'd
,
I
go
in
,
resolve
,
since
I
have
find
him
at
home
,
to
wait
his
leisure
.
<EOS>
in
a
little
Time
Mr.
Salter
enter'd
the
Room
;
and
after
customary
ceremony
,
ask
my
Patience
a
little
longer
,
he
desire
I
would
sit
down
and
bear
Ensign
Fanshaw
Company
(
for
so
he
call'd
him
)
add
at
go
out
,
he
have
a
little
business
that
require
Dispatch
;
which
be
over
,
he
would
return
,
and
join
Company
.
  
<EOS>
the
Ensign
,
as
he
call'd
him
,
appear'd
to
me
under
a
Dishabilee
;
and
the
first
Question
he
ask'd
me
,
be
,
if
I
would
drink
a
Glass
of
English
Beer
?
<EOS>
mislead
by
his
appearance
,
though
I
assent
,
it
be
with
a
design
to
treat
;
which
he
would
be
no
Means
permit
;
but
call
to
a
servant
,
order
some
in
.
<EOS>
We
sit
drink
that
Liquor
,
which
to
me
be
a
great
rarity
than
all
the
Wine
in
Spain
;
when
in
dropt
an
old
Acquaintance
of
mine
,
Mr.
Le
Noy
,
Secretary
to
Colonel
Nevil
.
<EOS>
He
sit
down
with
us
,
and
before
the
Glass
could
go
twice
round
,
tell
Ensign
Fanshaw
,
that
his
Colonel
give
his
humble
service
to
him
,
and
order
him
to
let
him
know
,
that
he
have
but
threescore
Pistoles
by
him
,
which
he
have
send
,
and
which
be
at
his
Service
,
as
what
he
<EOS>
pleas'd
more
should
be
,
as
soon
as
it
come
to
his
Hands
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
I
begin
to
look
upon
my
ensign
as
another
guess
person
than
I
have
take
him
for
;
and
Le
Noy
imagine
,
by
our
set
cheek
by
joul
together
,
that
I
must
be
in
the
Secret
,
soon
after
give
him
the
Title
of
Captain
.
<EOS>
this
soon
convinc'd
me
,
that
there
be
more
in
the
matter
than
I
be
yet
Master
of
;
for
lay
thing
together
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
but
argue
within
my
self
,
that
as
it
seem'd
<EOS>
at
first
,
a
most
incredible
thing
,
that
a
person
of
his
appearance
should
have
so
large
Credit
,
with
such
a
Complement
at
the
end
of
it
,
without
some
disguise
,
and
as
from
an
Ensign
he
be
rise
to
be
a
Captain
,
in
the
taking
of
one
Bottle
of
English
Beer
;
a
little
Patience
would
let
me
into
a
Farce
,
in
which
,
at
present
,
I
have
not
the
Honour
to
bear
any
Part
but
that
of
a
Mute
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
Le
Noy
take
his
leave
,
and
as
soon
as
he
have
leave
us
,
and
the
other
Bottle
be
bring
in
,
Ensign
Fanshaw
begin
to
open
his
heart
,
and
tell
me
,
who
he
be
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
necessitate
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
be
under
this
Disguise
,
to
conceal
my
self
,
especially
in
this
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
you
must
know
,
"
continue
he
,
"
that
when
our
force
be
Lords
of
this
Town
,
as
we
be
for
a
little
while
,
I
fall
under
an
intrigue
with
another
Man
's
Wife
;
Her
husband
be
a
person
of
considerable
account
;
nevertheless
the
Wife
<EOS>
show'd
me
<EOS>
all
the
Favours
that
a
soldier
,
under
a
long
and
hard
Campaigne
,
could
be
imagine
to
ask
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
her
Relations
get
acquaint
with
our
Amour
,
and
know
that
I
be
among
the
Prisoners
take
at
Breuhiga
,
be
now
upon
the
Scout
and
Enquiry
,
to
make
a
Discovery
that
may
be
of
fatal
Consequence
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
reason
of
my
disguise
;
this
the
unfortunate
Occasion
of
my
taking
upon
me
a
name
that
do
not
belong
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
speak
all
this
with
such
an
Openness
of
Heart
,
that
in
return
of
so
much
confidence
,
I
confess'd
to
him
,
that
I
have
hear
of
the
Affair
,
for
that
it
have
make
no
little
noise
all
over
the
Country
;
that
it
highly
behove
him
to
take
great
care
of
himself
,
since
as
the
Relations
on
both
side
be
considerable
,
he
must
consequently
be
in
great
Danger
;
that
in
case
of
that
nature
,
no
People
in
the
World
carry
thing
to
great
extremity
,
than
the
Spaniards
.
<EOS>
He
return'd
me
<EOS>
thank
for
my
good
Advice
,
which
I
understand
,
in
a
few
day
after
,
he
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
Friends
,
have
take
Care
to
put
in
Practice
;
for
he
be
convey'd
away
secretly
,
and
afterwards
have
the
Honour
to
be
make
a
Peer
of
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
My
Passport
be
at
last
sign'd
by
the
Count
de
las
Torres
,
I
prepare
for
a
Journey
,
I
have
long
and
ardently
wish'd
for
,
and
set
out
from
Madrid
,
in
the
beginning
of
September
,
1712
,
in
order
to
return
to
my
native
country
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
I
set
forward
upon
my
Journey
,
but
have
hear
,
both
before
and
since
my
being
in
Spain
,
very
famous
thing
speak
of
the
Escurial
;
though
it
be
a
League
out
of
my
Road
,
I
resolve
to
make
it
a
visit
.
<EOS>
and
I
must
confess
,
when
I
come
there
,
I
be
so
far
from
condemn
my
curiosity
,
that
I
choose
to
congratulate
my
good
Fortune
,
that
have
,
at
half
a
Day
's
Expence
,
feast
my
eye
with
extraordinarie
,
which
would
have
justify'd
a
twelve
-
month
'
Journey
on
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
the
Structure
be
intirely
magnificent
,
beyond
any
thing
I
ever
see
,
or
any
thing
my
imagination
could
frame
.
<EOS>
It
be
compose
of
eleven
several
quadrangle
,
with
noble
cloister
round
every
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
the
front
to
the
West
be
adorn'd
with
three
stately
Gates
;
every
one
of
a
different
model
,
yet
every
one
the
model
of
nice
Architecture
.
<EOS>
the
Middlemost
of
the
three
lead
into
a
fine
Chapel
of
the
Hieronomites
,
as
they
call
them
;
in
which
be
entertain'd
one
hundred
and
fifty
Monks
.
<EOS>
at
every
of
the
four
Corners
of
this
august
Fabrick
,
there
be
a
Turret
of
excellent
Workmanship
,
which
yield
to
the
Whole
an
extraordinary
air
of
Grandure
.
<EOS>
the
King
's
palace
be
on
the
North
,
near
that
Mountain
,
whence
the
Stone
it
be
build
of
be
hew'n
;
and
all
the
South
Part
be
set
off
with
many
gallery
,
both
beautiful
and
sumptuous
.
  
<EOS>
this
prodigious
Pile
,
which
,
as
I
have
say
,
exceed
all
that
I
ever
see
;
and
which
would
ask
,
of
it
self
,
a
volume
to
particularize
,
be
build
by
Philip
the
Second
.
<EOS>
He
lay'd
the
first
Stone
,
yet
liv'd
to
see
it
finish
;
and
lie
bury
in
the
Panthaeon
,
a
part
of
it
,
set
apart
for
the
Burial
-
place
of
succeed
Princes
,
as
well
as
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
dedicated
to
Saint
Laurence
,
in
the
very
Foundation
;
and
therefore
build
in
the
Shape
of
a
Gridiron
,
the
instrument
of
that
Martyr
's
execution
;
and
in
memory
of
a
great
victory
obtain
on
that
Saint
's
day
.
<EOS>
the
Stone
of
which
it
be
build
,
contrary
to
the
common
course
,
grow
whiter
by
Age
;
and
the
Quarry
,
whence
<EOS>
it
be
dig
,
lie
near
enough
,
if
it
have
Sense
or
Ambition
,
to
grow
enamour'd
of
its
own
wonderful
production
.
<EOS>
some
there
be
,
who
stick
not
to
assign
this
Convenience
,
as
the
main
cause
of
its
situation
;
and
for
my
part
,
I
must
agree
,
that
I
have
see
many
other
Parts
of
Spain
,
where
that
glorious
Building
would
have
shine
with
yet
far
great
Splendour
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
Town
of
any
Consequence
present
it
self
in
my
way
to
Burgos
.
<EOS>
here
I
take
up
my
quarter
that
night
;
where
I
meet
with
an
Irish
Priest
,
whose
name
be
white
.
<EOS>
as
be
natural
on
such
rencounter
,
have
answer
his
Enquiry
,
whither
I
be
go
;
he
very
kindly
tell
me
,
he
should
be
very
glad
of
my
company
as
far
as
Victoria
,
which
lie
in
my
Road
;
and
I
with
equal
Frankness
<EOS>
embrac'd
the
offer
.
  
<EOS>
Next
Morning
,
when
we
have
mount
our
Mules
,
and
be
get
a
little
Distance
from
Burgos
;
he
begin
to
relate
to
me
a
great
many
impious
Pranks
of
an
English
Officer
,
who
have
be
a
prisoner
there
a
little
before
I
come
;
conclude
all
,
with
some
Vehemence
,
that
he
have
give
great
Occasion
of
Scandal
and
Infamy
to
his
native
country
,
than
would
easily
be
wipe
off
,
or
in
a
little
time
.
<EOS>
the
Truth
of
it
be
,
many
particularly
,
which
he
relate
to
me
,
be
too
monstrously
vile
to
admit
of
any
repetition
here
;
and
highly
merit
that
unfortunate
end
,
which
that
Officer
meet
with
some
time
after
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
the
just
reflection
make
by
that
Father
,
plainly
manifest
to
me
the
Folly
of
those
gentleman
,
who
,
by
such
inadvertency
,
to
say
no
bad
,
cause
the
Honour
of
the
land
of
their
nativity
to
be
call
in
question
.
<EOS>
for
tho
'
,
no
doubt
,
it
be
a
very
false
conclusion
,
from
a
singular
,
to
conceive
a
general
character
;
yet
in
a
strange
country
,
nothing
be
more
common
,
a
man
therefore
,
of
common
Sense
,
would
carefully
avoid
all
occasion
of
Censure
,
if
not
in
respect
to
himself
,
yet
out
of
a
human
regard
to
such
of
his
Countrymen
as
may
have
the
Fortune
to
come
after
him
;
and
,
it
be
more
than
probable
,
may
desire
to
hear
a
well
and
juster
Character
of
their
country
,
and
Countrymen
,
than
he
perhaps
may
incline
to
leave
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
travel
along
,
Father
White
tell
me
,
that
near
the
place
of
our
quartering
that
Night
,
there
be
a
Convent
of
the
carthusian
Order
,
which
would
be
well
worth
my
seeing
.
<EOS>
I
be
doubly
glad
to
hear
it
,
as
it
be
an
order
most
a
stranger
to
me
;
and
as
I
have
often
hear
from
many
other
,
most
unaccountable
Relations
of
the
severity
of
their
way
of
Life
,
and
the
very
odd
original
of
their
institution
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
therefore
,
be
Sunday
,
we
take
a
walk
to
the
Convent
.
<EOS>
It
be
situate
at
the
Foot
of
a
great
Hill
,
have
a
pretty
little
River
run
before
it
.
<EOS>
the
Hill
be
naturally
cover'd
with
Evergreens
of
various
Sorts
;
but
the
very
summit
of
the
Rock
be
so
impending
,
that
one
would
at
first
Sight
be
lead
to
apprehend
the
destruction
of
the
Convent
,
from
the
fall
of
it
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
which
,
they
have
very
curious
and
well
order
Gardens
;
which
lead
me
to
observe
,
that
,
what
ever
man
may
pretend
,
Pleasure
be
not
incompatible
with
the
most
austere
Life
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
if
I
may
guess
of
other
by
this
,
no
order
in
that
Church
can
boast
of
fine
convent
.
<EOS>
Their
Chapel
be
completely
neat
,
the
Altar
of
it
set
out
with
the
utmost
magnificence
,
both
as
to
fine
painting
,
and
other
rich
Adornments
.
<EOS>
the
building
be
answerable
to
the
rest
;
and
,
in
short
,
nothing
seem'd
omit
,
that
may
render
it
beautiful
or
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
take
a
full
survey
of
all
;
we
,
not
without
some
Regret
,
return'd
to
our
very
indifferent
Inn
;
where
the
well
to
pass
away
the
Time
,
Father
White
give
me
an
ample
detail
of
the
original
of
that
order
.
<EOS>
I
have
before
-
hand
hear
somewhat
of
it
;
nevertheless
,
I
do
not
care
to
interrupt
him
,
because
I
have
a
mind
to
hear
how
his
Account
would
agree
with
what
I
have
already
hear
.

"
Good
Bruno
,
ponder
upon
these
passage
,
could
not
fail
     
of
draw
this
conclusion
;
that
if
a
person
to
all
Appearance
     
so
holy
and
devout
,
should
miss
of
Salvation
,
it
behov'd
<EOS>
a
     
wise
Man
to
contrive
some
way
more
certain
to
make
his
Calling
     
and
Election
sure

<EOS>
to
that
purpose
he
institute
this
strict
     
and
severe
order

with
an
injunction
to
them
sacred

"
  
<EOS>
this
Account
I
find
to
agree
pretty
well
with
what
I
have
before
hear
;
but
at
the
same
time
,
I
find
the
redouble
of
it
make
but
<EOS>
just
the
same
impression
,
it
have
at
first
make
upon
my
heart
.
<EOS>
however
have
make
it
my
Observation
,
that
a
Spirit
the
least
contradictory
,
best
carry
a
man
through
Spain
;
I
keep
Father
White
Company
,
and
in
Humour
,
'
till
we
arrive
at
Victoria
.
<EOS>
where
he
add
one
Thing
,
by
Way
of
Appendix
,
in
relation
to
the
Carthusians
,
that
every
person
of
the
Society
,
be
oblig'd
<EOS>
every
day
to
go
into
their
Place
of
Burial
,
and
take
up
as
much
Earth
,
as
he
can
hold
at
a
Grasp
with
one
hand
,
in
order
to
prepare
his
Grave
.
  
<EOS>
Next
Day
we
set
out
for
Victoria
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sweet
,
delicious
,
and
pleasant
Town
.
<EOS>
It
receive
that
name
in
memory
of
a
considerable
victory
there
obtain
over
the
Moors
.
<EOS>
leave
this
place
,
I
part
with
Father
White
;
he
go
where
his
Affairs
lead
him
;
and
I
to
make
the
good
of
my
way
to
Bilboa
.
  
<EOS>
entre
into
Biscay
,
soon
after
I
leave
Victoria
,
I
be
at
a
loss
almost
to
imagine
,
what
country
I
be
get
into
.
<EOS>
by
my
long
stay
in
Spain
,
I
think
my
self
a
tolerable
Master
of
the
tongue
;
yet
here
I
find
my
self
at
the
utmost
loss
to
understand
Landlord
,
Landlady
,
or
any
of
the
Family
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
by
my
Muletier
,
that
they
pretend
their
language
,
as
they
call
it
,
have
continue
uncorrupted
from
the
very
Confusion
of
Babel
;
though
if
I
may
freely
give
my
opinion
in
the
matter
,
I
should
rather
take
it
to
be
the
very
corruption
of
all
that
Confusion
.
<EOS>
another
Rhodomontado
they
have
,
(
for
in
this
they
be
perfect
Spaniards
)
that
neither
Romans
,
Carthaginians
,
Vandals
,
Goths
,
or
moor
,
ever
totally
subdue
them
.
<EOS>
and
yet
any
man
that
have
ever
see
their
country
,
may
cut
this
Knot
without
a
Hatchet
,
by
say
truly
,
that
neither
roman
,
Carthaginian
,
nor
any
victorious
People
,
think
it
worth
while
to
make
a
Conquest
of
a
country
,
so
mountainous
and
so
barren
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
Bilboa
must
be
allow
,
tho
'
not
very
large
,
to
be
a
pretty
,
clean
and
neat
Town
.
<EOS>
here
,
as
in
Amsterdam
,
they
allow
neither
Cart
,
nor
Coach
,
to
enter
;
but
every
thing
of
Merchandize
be
draw
,
and
carry
upon
sledge
:
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
a
place
of
no
small
Account
,
as
to
Trade
;
and
especially
for
Iron
and
Wooll
.
<EOS>
here
I
hop'd
to
have
meet
with
an
opportunity
of
Embarking
for
England
;
but
to
my
sorrow
I
find
my
self
disappointed
,
and
under
that
Disappointment
,
oblige
to
make
the
good
of
my
way
to
Bayonne
.
  
<EOS>
set
out
for
which
Place
,
the
first
Town
of
Note
that
I
come
to
,
be
Saint
Sebastian
.
<EOS>
a
very
clean
Town
,
and
neatly
pay'd
;
which
be
no
little
Rarity
in
Spain
.
<EOS>
It
have
a
very
good
Wall
about
it
,
and
a
pretty
Citadel
.
<EOS>
at
this
place
I
meet
with
two
English
Officers
,
who
be
under
the
same
state
with
my
self
;
one
of
them
be
a
Prisoner
of
War
with
me
at
Denia
.
<EOS>
They
be
go
to
Bayonne
to
embark
for
England
as
well
as
my
self
;
so
we
agree
to
set
out
together
for
Port
Passage
.
<EOS>
the
Road
from
St.
Sebastian
be
all
over
a
well
pav'd
Stone
Causeway
;
almost
at
the
end
whereof
,
there
accost
us
a
great
number
of
young
Lasses
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
prettily
dress'd
,
their
long
Hair
flow
in
a
decent
manner
over
their
shoulder
,
and
here
and
there
decorate
with
ribbon
of
various
colour
,
which
wantonly
play'd
on
their
back
with
the
wind
.
<EOS>
the
Sight
surpriz'd
my
Fellow
traveller
no
less
than
me
;
and
the
more
,
as
they
advance
directly
up
to
us
,
and
seiz'd
our
Hands
.
<EOS>
but
a
little
time
undeceiv'd
us
,
and
we
find
what
they
come
for
;
and
that
their
Contest
,
tho
'
not
so
robust
as
our
oar
on
the
Thames
,
be
much
of
the
same
nature
;
each
contend
who
should
have
us
for
their
Fare
.
<EOS>
for
'
tis
here
a
Custom
of
Time
out
of
mind
,
that
none
but
young
woman
should
have
the
management
and
profit
of
that
Ferry
.
<EOS>
and
tho
"
the
Ferry
be
over
an
Arm
of
the
Sea
,
very
broad
,
and
sometimes
very
rough
,
those
fair
ferrier
manage
themselves
with
that
dexterity
,
that
the
Passage
be
very
little
dangerous
,
and
in
calm
Weather
,
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
we
make
choice
of
those
that
best
please
us
;
who
in
a
grateful
Return
,
lead
us
down
to
their
Boat
under
a
sort
of
music
,
which
they
,
walk
along
,
make
with
their
oar
,
and
which
we
all
think
far
from
be
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
thus
be
we
transport
over
to
Port
Passage
;
not
undeservedly
account
the
good
Harbour
in
all
the
Bay
of
Biscay
.
  
<EOS>
We
stay'd
not
long
here
after
landing
,
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
reach
Fonterabia
before
night
;
but
all
the
Expedition
we
could
use
,
little
avail'd
;
for
before
we
could
reach
thither
the
Gates
be
shut
,
and
good
nature
and
Humanity
be
so
lock'd
up
with
them
,
that
all
the
Rhetorick
we
be
master
of
could
not
prevail
upon
the
Governor
to
order
their
be
open
;
for
which
reason
we
be
oblige
to
take
up
our
quarter
at
the
Ferry
House
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
get
up
the
next
morning
,
we
find
the
Waters
so
broad
,
as
well
as
rough
,
that
we
begin
to
enquire
after
another
passage
;
and
be
answer'd
,
that
at
the
Isle
of
Conference
,
but
a
short
League
upwards
,
the
Passage
be
much
short
,
and
expose
to
less
Danger
.
<EOS>
such
good
Reasons
soon
determind
be
us
:
<EOS>
so
,
set
out
we
get
there
in
a
very
little
time
;
and
very
soon
after
be
land
in
France
.
<EOS>
here
we
find
a
House
of
very
good
Entertainment
,
a
thing
we
have
long
want
,
and
much
lament
the
want
of
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
hardly
well
seated
in
the
House
before
we
be
make
sensible
,
that
it
be
the
Custom
,
which
have
make
it
the
business
of
our
Host
,
to
entertain
all
his
Guests
at
first
come
in
,
with
a
prolix
account
of
that
remarkable
interview
between
the
two
king
of
France
and
Spain
.
<EOS>
I
speak
safely
now
,
as
be
get
on
French
Ground
:
for
the
Spaniard
in
his
own
Country
would
have
make
me
to
know
,
that
put
Spain
after
France
have
there
be
look'd
upon
as
a
meer
Solecism
in
Speech
.
<EOS>
however
,
have
refiresh'd
our
self
,
to
show
our
deference
to
our
host
's
relation
,
we
agree
to
pay
our
respect
to
that
famous
little
Isle
he
mention'd
;
which
indeed
,
be
the
whole
burden
of
the
Design
of
our
crafty
Landlord
's
relation
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
there
,
we
find
it
a
little
oval
Island
,
over
-
run
with
weed
,
and
surround
with
Reeds
and
Rushes

"
upon
this
     
little
Spot
,
be
at
that
juncture

Monarchs
in

<EOS>
a
noble

in
the
middle
of
that

a
very
     
large
oval
table
;
at
which
be
the
Conference
,
from
which
the
     
Place
receiv'd
its
Title
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
Bridges
rais'd
;
one
     
on
the
spanish
side
,
the
passage
to
which
be

little
upon
     
a
Descent
by
reason
of
the
Hills
adjacent
;
and
the
other
upon
     
the
french
side

Level

the
two

upon
a
     
Signal

forward
at
the

time
;
the
     
Spanish
Monarch
hand
the
Infanta
his
Daughter
to
the
     
Place
of
Interview

<EOS>
as

they

<EOS>
the

both
Annies

<EOS>
then
the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
relation
so
very
inconsistent
with
the
present
State
of
the
place
;
we
take
Horse
(
for
Mule
-
mount
be
now
out
of
fashion
)
and
ride
to
Saint
Jean
de

,
where
we
find
as
great
a
difference
in
our
Eating
and
Drinking
,
as
we
have
before
do
in
our
riding
.
<EOS>
here
they
may
be
properly
call'd
<EOS>
Houses
of
Entertainment
;
tho
'
generally
speak
,
till
we
come
to
this
place
,
we
meet
with
very
mean
fare
,
and
be
poorly
accommodate
in
the
Houses
where
we
lodge
.
  
<EOS>
a
person
that
travel
this
way
,
would
be
esteem'd
<EOS>
a
man
of
a
narrow
curiosity

who
should
not
desire
to
see
the
Chamber
where
Louis

his
first
Night

<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
it
be
put
into
my
Head
,
out
of
an
ambition
to
evince
my
self
a
person
of
Taste
,
I
ask
the
Question
,
and
the
Favour
be
grant
me
,
with
a
great
deal
of
French
Civility
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
find
any
thing
here
,
more
than
in
the
Isle
of
Conference
,
but
what
Tradition
only
have
render
remarkable
.
  
<EOS>
Saint
Jean
de
Luz
be
esteem'd
<EOS>
one
of
the
great
Village
town
in
all
France
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
great
Church
of
this
Place
,
that
Lewis

to
marriage
Articles

take
before
the
high
Altar
the
Oath
of
Renunciation
to
the
Crown

by

Inheritance

<EOS>
the
Natives

expert
Seamen

especially
in
Whale

<EOS>
here
be
a
fine
Bridge
of
Wood

in

be
a
Descent

,
into
a
pretty
little
Island
;
where
be
a
Chapel
,
and
a
Palace
belong
to
the
Bishop
of
Bayonne
.
<EOS>
here
the
Queen
Dowager
of
Spain
often
walk
to
divert
herself
;
and
on
this
Bridge
,
and
in
the
Walks
on
the
Island
,
I
have
the
Honour
to
see
that
Princess
more
than
once
.
  
<EOS>
this
Villa
not
be
above
four
league
from
Bayonne
,
we
get
there
by
dinner
time
,
where
at
an
ordinary
of
twenty
sous
,
we
eat
and
drink
in
Plenty
,
and
with
a
gusto
,
much
well
than
in
any
part
of
Spain
;
where
for
eat
much
bad

we
pay
very
much
more
.
  
<EOS>
BAYONNE
be
a
Town
strong
by
nature
;
yet
the
fortification
have
be
very
much
neglect
,
since
the

of
the
Citadel

on

which
not

command
the
Town

but
the

too

<EOS>
It

and
rais'd
on

impregnable

<EOS>
the
Marshal
Bouflers

there
be
a
fine
Walk
near

from
which

<EOS>
there

to

the

,
as
they
tell

,
that
have
come

since
the

of
the
War

<EOS>
on

<EOS>
here
the

Dowager
of

keep
her
Court
ever
since
the
Jealousy
of
the

King
reclus'd
her
from
Madrid
.
<EOS>
as
Aunt
to
his
competitor
Charles

<EOS>
he
apprehend
her
intrigueing
;
for
which
Reason
give
her
an
Option
of
Retreat
,
that
Princess
make
choice
of
this
City
,
much
to
the
Advantage
of
the
place
,
and
in
all
appearance
much
to
her
own
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
Lady
not
of
the

size
;
and
live
here
in
suitable
Splendour
,
and
not
without
the
respect
due
to
a
person
of
her
high
quality
:
<EOS>
every
time
she
go
to
take
the
air
,
the
Cannon
of
the
Citadel
salute
her
,
as
she
pass
over
the
Bridge
;
and
to
say
Truth
,
the
Country
round
be
extremely
pleasant
,
and
abound
in
plenty
of
all
provision

especially
in

Fowl

<EOS>
Bayonne
Hams

<EOS>
We
wait
here
near
five
month
before
the
expect
Transports
arrive
from
England
,
without
any
other
amusement
,
than
such
as
be
common
to
People
under
Suspence
.
<EOS>
short
Tours
will
not
admit
of
great
variety
;
and
much
Acquaintance
could
not
be
any
way
suitable
to
People
,
that
have
long
be
in
a
strange
country
,
and
earnestly
desire
to
return
to
our
own
.
<EOS>
yet
one
Accident
befall
me
here
,
that
be
near
cost
me
my
life
,
than
all
I
have
before
encounter'd
,
either
in
Battle
or
Siege
.
  
<EOS>
go
to
my
Lodgings
one
Evening
,
I
unfortunately
meet
with
an
Officer
,
who
would
need
have
me
along
with
him
,
aboard
one
of
the
English
Ships
,
to
drink
a
Bottle
of
English
Beer
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
often
invite
,
he
say
;
and
I
be
afraid
<EOS>
our
Countryman
,
continue
he
,
will
hold
himself
slight
,
if
I
delay
it
longer
.
<EOS>
English
Beer
be
a
great
rarity
,
and
the
Vessel
lie
not
at
any
great
distance
from
my
Lodgings
;
so
without
any
further
Persuasion
I
consent
.
<EOS>
when
we
come
upon
the
Bridge
,
to
which
the
ship
we
be
to
go
aboard
be
fasten
,
we
find
,
as
be
customary
,
as
well
as
necessary
,
a
Plank
lay
over
from
the
Ship
,
and
a
rope
to
hold
by
,
for
safe
passage
.
<EOS>
the
Night
be
very
dark
;
and
I
have
cautiously
enough
take
care
to
provide
a
man
with
a
lanthorn
to
prevent
casualty
.
<EOS>
the
man
with
the
light
go
first
,
and
out
of
his
abundant
Complaisance
,
my
friend
,
the
Officer
,
would
have
me
follow
the
light
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
no
sooner
stept
upon
the
Plank
after
my
guide
,
but
Rope
and
Plank
give
way
,
and
Guide
<EOS>
and
I
tumble
both
together
into
the
Water
.
  
<EOS>
the
Tide
be
then
run
in
pretty
strong
:
<EOS>
however
,
my
foot
in
the
fall
touch
Ground
,
give
me
an
opportunity
to
recover
my
self
a
little
;
at
which
time
<EOS>
I
catch'd
fast
hold
of
a
Buoy
,
which
be
plac'd
over
an
Anchor
on
one
of
the
Ships
there
ride
:
I
hold
fast
,
till
the
Tide
rise
strong
and
strong
throw
me
off
my
foot
;
which
give
an
opportunity
to
the
poor
Fellow
,
our
lanthorn
-
bearer
,
to
lay
hold
of
one
of
my
Legs
,
by
which
he
hold
as
fast
as
I
by
the
Buoy
.
<EOS>
We
have
lain
thus
lovingly
at
Hull
together
,
strugle
with
the
increase
Tide
,
which
,
well
for
us
,
do
not
break
my
hold
(
for
if
it
have
,
the
ship
which
lie
breast
a
breast
have
certainly
suck
us
under
)
<EOS>
when
several
on
the
Bridge
,
who
see
us
fall
,
bring
other
with
Ropes
and
Lights
to
our
assistance
;
and
especially
my
Brother
Officer
,
who
have
be
Accessary
as
well
as
Spectator
of
our
Calamity
;
tho
'
at
last
a
very
small
Portion
of
our
deliverance
fall
to
his
share
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
could
feel
a
Rope
,
I
quit
my
hold
of
the
Buoy
;
but
my
poor
drag
at
my
Heels
would
not
on
any
account
quit
his
hold
of
my
Leg
.
<EOS>
and
as
it
be
next
to
an
impossibility
,
in
that
Posture
to
draw
us
up
the
Bridge
to
save
both
,
if
either
of
us
,
we
must
still
have
perish
,
have
not
the
Alarm
bring
off
a
Boat
or
two
to
our
Succour
,
who
take
us
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
carry'd
as
fast
as
possible
,
to
a
neighbour
House
hard
by
,
where
they
take
immediate
care
to
make
a
good
fire
;
and
where
I
have
not
be
long
before
our
intend
Host
,
the
Master
of
the
Ship
,
come
in
very
much
concern'd
,
and
blame
us
for
not
hail
the
Vessel
,
before
we
make
an
attempt
to
enter
.
<EOS>
for
,
say
he
,
the
very
Night
before
,
my
Vessel
be
robb'd
;
and
that
Plank
and
Rope
be
a
trap
design'd
for
the
thief
,
if
they
come
again
;
not
imagine
that
man
in
an
honest
way
would
have
come
on
board
without
ask
Questions
.
<EOS>
like
the
wise
man
of
this
World
,
I
hereupon
begin
to
form
resolution
against
a
thing
,
which
be
never
again
likely
to
happen
;
and
to
draw
inference
of
instruction
from
an
Accident
,
that
have
not
so
much
as
a
Moral
for
its
Foundation
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
after
this
,
partly
out
of
business
,
and
partly
out
of
Curiosity
,
I
go
to
see
the
Mint
here
,
and
have
take
notice
to
one
of
the
Officers
,
that
there
be
a
difference
in
the
Impress
of
their
Crown
Pieces
,
one
have
at
the
bottom
the
Impress
of
a
cow
,
and
the
other
none
:
       
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
reply'd
that
Officer
,
"
you
be
much

your
Observation

that
the
Reason
of
that
addition

be
this
:
a
certain
king
of
Navarr
<EOS>
(
when
it
be
a
     
Kingdom
distinct
from
that
of
France

look
out

a

of

spy'd
<EOS>
a
Cow

stand
     
aside

attack'd
<EOS>
by
a
Lyon

<EOS>
the
Lyon
strove
to
get
the
young
calf
into

the
Cow
bravely
defend
her
charge

and
so
well

that
the
     
Lyon
at

,
tir'd
and
weary

withdraw

whether

no
my

guess'd
<EOS>
at
the

whether
it
be
fact

I
dare
not
determine
;
but
to
me
it
<EOS>
seem'd
<EOS>
apparent
,
that
it
be
no
otherways
intend
,
than
as
an
emblematical
Fable
to
cover
,
and
preserve
the
memory
of
the
Deliverance
of
Henry
the
Fourth
,
then
the
young
King
of
Navarr
,
at
that
eternally
ignominious
Slaughter
,
the
Massacre
of
Paris
.
<EOS>
many
Historians
,
their
own
as
well
as
other
,
agree
,
that
the
House
of
Guise
have
levell'd
<EOS>
the
Malice
of
their
design
at
that
great
Prince
.
<EOS>
They
know
him
to
be
the
lawful
heir
;
but
as
they
know
him
breed
,
what
they
call'd
<EOS>
a
Hugonot
<EOS>
,
Barbarity
and
Injustice
be
easily
conceal'd
under
the
Cloak
of
Religion
,
and
the
Good
of
Mother
Church
,
under
the
veil
of
Ambition
,
be
hold
sufficient
to
postpone
the
Laws
of
God
and
Man
.
<EOS>
some
of
those
Historians
have
deliver'd
it
as
matter
of
Fact
,
that
the
Conspirators
,
in
search
after
that
young
King
,
press'd
into
the
very
apartment
of
the
Queen
his
Mother
;
who
have
,
at
the
Toll
of
the
Bell
,
and
Cries
of
the
Murder'd
,
take
the
Alarm
,
on
hear
'em
come
,
plac'd
<EOS>
her
self
in
her
Chair

and
cover'd
<EOS>
the
young
King
her
Son
with
her
Farthingale
,
till
they
be
go
.
<EOS>
by
which
mean
she
find
an
opportunity
to
convey
him
to
a
place
of
more
safety
;
and
so
preserv'd
him
from
those
bloody
Murderers
,
and
in
them
from
the
Paw
of
the
Lyon
.
<EOS>
this
be
only
a
private
reflection
of
my
own
at
that
time
;
but
I
think
carry
so
great
<EOS>
a
face
of
Probability
,
that
I
can
see
no
present
reason
to
reject
it
.
<EOS>
and
to
have
seek
after
well
information
from
the
Officer
of
the
Mint
,
have
be
to
sacrifice
my
discretion
to
my
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
stay'd
at
Bayonne
,
the
Princess
Ursini
come
thither
,
attend
by
some
of

King

<EOS>
She
have
be
to
drink
the
Waters
of
some
famous
Spaw
in

Neighbourhood
,
the
name
of
which
have
now
slipt
my
memory

<EOS>
She
be
most
splendidly
entertain'd
by
the
Queen
Dowager
of
Spain
;
and
the
Mareschal
de
Montrevel
no

signaliz'd
himself
in
his
reception
of
that
great
Lady
,
who
be
at
that

the
great
Favourite

Spanish
Court

<EOS>
about

him
<EOS>
(

<EOS>
the
reason
why
he
be
represent
in

:
the
Hermit
answer
with
great
civility
,
and
tell
me
,
he
have
his

from
Christo
Ferendo
,
for
when
our
Saviour
be
young
,
he
have
an
inclination
to
pass
a

so
Saint
Christopher
take
him
on

carry
him
over

grow
deep

at

next

I

stay'd

<EOS>
in

present
;
of
which
the
Master
take
due
advantage

we
sail'd
over
the
Bar
into
the
Bay

Biscay
.
<EOS>
this
be
with
sailor
,
to
a
Proverb

reckon'd
the
roughest
of

yet
on
our
entrance
into

nothing
appear'd
<EOS>
like
it

'
<EOS>
Twas

a

three
<EOS>
Leagues

before

<EOS>
as
near

it

twenty

<EOS>
the
Sailors

one
and
all

as
soon
as
they
see
it

declar'd
<EOS>
it
the
certain
Forerunner

<EOS>
however

our

keep
on
its
course

before
a
fine
Gale

till
we
have
near
pass
over
half
the

all
on

there
be
such
a
hideous
Alteration

as
make
nature
recoil
on
the
very
Reflection

<EOS>
those
Seas
<EOS>
that
seem'd
<EOS>
before
to

upon
us

with
the
aspect

now
in

Moment
chang'd
<EOS>
their
flattering
Countenance
into
that
of

and
frown

the
certain
Indexes
of
Wrath
,
present
us
with
apparent
Danger
,
of
which
little
on
this
Side
Death
could
be
the
Sequel

<EOS>
the
angry
wave
cast
themselves
up
into
Mountains
,
and
scourg'd
<EOS>
the
ship
on
every
side
from
Poop

Prow

<EOS>
such
shock
from
the

Wind

Surges

<EOS>
such
Falls
from
Precipices
of
Water
,
to
dismal
Caverns
of
the

uncertain
Element

<EOS>
although
the
latter
seem'd
to
receive
us
in
order
to
skreen
us
from
the
Riot

imagination
could

in

<EOS>
and
yet
those

theirs
about

so
very
boisterous

<EOS>
lash'd
<EOS>
the
Rudder
of
the
Ship

<EOS>
resolv'd
to

since
it

past
their
Skill

<EOS>
this
be
our
way
of
sojourn
most
part
of
that
tedious
night
;
drive
where
the
Winds
and
wave
think
fit
to
drive
us
,
with
all
our
sail
quite
lower'd
<EOS>
and
flat
upon

<EOS>
if

<EOS>
what

Prose
could
serve

paint
our
passion

or
our
expectation

<EOS>
alas

<EOS>
our
only
expectation
be
in
the
Return
of
morning
;
It
come
at
last
;
yet
even
slowly
as
it
come
,
when
come

we
think
it
come
too
soon

a
new
scene
of
sudden
death
be
all
the
Advantage
of
its
first
appearance
.
<EOS>
Our
ship
be
drive
full
Speed
,
towards
the
Breakers
on
the
Cabritton
Shore
,
between
Burdeaux
and
Bayonne
;
which
fill
us
with
idea
more
terrible
than
all
before

since
those
be
past

and
these
seemingly
as
certain

<EOS>
beside

to
add
to
our
Distress
,
the
Tide
be
drive
in
,
and
consequently
must
drive
us
fast
to
visible
destruction

<EOS>
a
state
so
evident

that
one

great
experience
have
render'd
more
sensible
of

be
prepare

by
lash
himself
to
the
main
Mast

against
the
expect
Minute

Desolation

<EOS>
He
be
about
that
melancholy
Work

in
utter
despair
of
any
well
Fortune
,
when
,
as
loud
as
ever
he
could
bawl
,
he
cry'd
out
,
a
Point
,
a
point
of
Wind
.
<EOS>
to
me
,
who
have
have
too
much
of
it
,
it
appear'd
<EOS>
like
the
sound
of
the
last
trump
;
but
to
the
more
intelligent
Crew
,
it
have
a
different
sound
.
<EOS>
with
Vigour
and
Alacrity
they
start
from
their
prayer
,
or
their
despair
,
and
with
all
imaginable
Speed
,
unlash'd
<EOS>
the
Rudder
,
and
hoist
all
their
Sails

<EOS>
never
sure
in
Nature
do
one
Minute
produce
a
great
scene
of
Contraries

<EOS>
the
more
skilful
sailor
take
courage
at
this
happy
Presage
of
Deliverance
.
<EOS>
and
accord
to
their
expectation
do
it
happen
;
that
heavenly
Point
of
Wind
deliver'd
<EOS>
us
from
the
Jaws
of
those
Breakers
,
ready
open
to
devour
us
;
and
carry
us
out
to
the
much
more
wellcome
wide
Sea
,
furnish
every
one
in
the
Ship
with
Thoughts
,
as
distant
as
we
think
our
Danger
.
  
<EOS>
We
endeavour
to
make
Port
Passage
;
but
our
ship
become
unruly
,
and
would
not
answer
her
Helm
;
for
which
reason
we
be
glad
to
go
before
the
wind
,
and
make
for
the
Harbour
of
Saint
Jean
de
Luz
.
<EOS>
this
we
attain'd
without
any
great
difficulty
,
and
to
the
Satisfaction
of
all
,
sailor
as
well
as
passenger
,
we
there
cast
Anchor
,
after
the
most
terrible
storm
(
as
all
the
old
sailor
agree
)
and
as
much
Danger
as
ever
People
escap'd
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
take
notice
,
that
the
Sailors
buoy'd
up
their
cable
with
Hogsheads
;
enquire
into
the
Reason
of
which
,
they
tell
me
,
that
the
Rocks
at
the
bottom
of
the
Harbour
be
by
experience
find
to
be
so
very
sharp
,
that
they
would
otherwise
cut
their
cable
asunder
.
<EOS>
Our
ship
be
oblige
to
be
draw
up
into
the
dock
to
be
refit
;
during
which
,
I
lie
in
the
Town
,
where
nothing
of
Moment
,
or
worth
reciting
,
happen'd
.
  
<EOS>
I
beg
Pardon
for
my
error
;
the
very
movement
of
Princes
must
always
be
considerable
,
and
consequently
worth
Recital
.
<EOS>
while
the
ship
lie
in
the
Dock
,
I
be
one
evening
walk
upon
the
Bridge
,
with
the
little
Island
near
it
,
(
which
I
have
before
speak
of
)
and
have
a
little
spanish
Dog
along
with
me
,
when
at
the
further
end
I
spy'd
a
Lady
,
and
three
or
four
gentleman
in
Company
;
I
keep
on
my
pace
of
Leisure
,
and
so
do
they
;
but
when
I
come
nearer
,
I
find
they
as
much
out
number'd
<EOS>
me
in
the
Dog
,
as
they
do
in
the
human
kind
.
<EOS>
and
I
soon
experience
to
my
sorrow
,
that
their
dog
,
by
their
Fierceness
and
Ill
-
humour
,
be
Dogs
of
Quality
;
have
,
without
warning
,
or
the
least
Declaration
of
War

fall
upon
my
little
Dog
,
accord
to
pristine
Custom
,
without
any
honourable
regard
to
size

Interest
or
Number

<EOS>
however
the
good
Lady

who
,
by
the
Privilege

her
Sex

must
be
allow'd
<EOS>
the
most
competent
Judge

out

Relief

poor

rate
her

<EOS>
the

of
profound
submission
;
which
I
could
not
much
wonder
at
,
when
I
understand
,
that
it
be
a
Queen
Dowager
of
Spain
,
who
have
chid
them
.
  
<EOS>
Our
ship
be
now
repair
,
and
make
fit
to
go
out
again
to
Sea
,
we
leave
the
Harbour
of
Saint
Jean
de
Luz
,
and
with
a
much
well
passage
,
as
the
last
Tempest
be
still
dance
in
my
imagination
,
in
ten
day
'
sail
we
<EOS>
reach'd
Dover
.
<EOS>
here
I
land
on
the
last
day
of
March
,
1713
have
not
,
till
then
,
see
or
touch'd
<EOS>
English
Shoar
from
the
beginning
of
May
,
1705
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
Coach
directly
for
London
,
where
,
when
I
arriv'd
,
I
think
my
self
transport
into
a
Country
more
foreign
,
than
any
I
have
either
fight
or
pilgrimag'd
in
.
<EOS>
not
foreign
,
do
I
mean
,
in
respect
to
other
,
so
much
as
to
it
self
.
<EOS>
I
leave
it
,
seemingly
,
under
a
perfect
unanimity
:
<EOS>
the
fatal
distinction
of
Whig
and
Tory
be
then
esteem
meerly
nominal
;
and
of
no
more
ill
Consequence
or
Danger
,
than
a
Bee
robb'd
of
its
Sting
.
<EOS>
the
national
concern
go
on
with
Vigour
,
and
the
prodigious
Success
of
the
Queen
's
arm
,
leave
every
soul
without
the
least
pretence
to
a
Murmur
.
<EOS>
but
now
on
my
Return
,
I
find
them
on
their
old
Establishment
,
perfect
Contraries
,
and
as
unlikely
to
be
bring
to
meet
as
direct
angle
.
<EOS>
some
arraigning
,
some
extolling
of
a
peace
;
in
which
Time
have
show
both
be
wrong
,
and
consequently
neither
could
be
right
in
their
notion
of
it
,
however
an
over
prejudic'd
way
of
thinking
may
draw
them
into
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
but
Whig
and
Tory
be
,
in
my
mind
,
the
compleatest
Paradox
in
Nature
,
and
yet
like
other
Paradoxes
,
old
as
I
be
,
I
live
in
Hope
to
see
,
before
I
die
,
those
seem
Contraries
perfectly
reconcil'd
,
and
reduc'd
<EOS>
into
one
happy
Certainty
,
the
Publick
Good
.

whilst
I
stay'd
at
Madrid
,
I
make
several
visit
to
my
old
Acquaintance
General
Mahoni
.
<EOS>
I
remember
that
he
tell
me
,
when
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
and
he
hold
a
Conference
at
Morvidro
,
his
lordship
use
many
argument
to
induce
him
to
leave
the
Spanish
Service
.
<EOS>
Mahoni
make
several
excuse
,
especially
that
none
of
his
religion
be
suffer'd
to
serve
in
the
English
Army
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
reply'd
,
that
he
would
undertake
to
get
him
except
by
an
Act
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
hear
him
speak
with
great
respect
of
his
lordship
,
and
be
strangely
surprize
,
that
after
so
many
glorious
success
he
should
be
send
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
likewise
pleased
to
inform
me
,
that
at
the
Battle
of
Saragoza
,
'
twa
his
Fortune
to
make
some
of
our
Horse
to
give
way
,
and
he
pursue
them
for
a
considerable
time
;
but
at
his
Return
,
he
see
the
Spanish
Army
in
great
confusion
:
<EOS>
but
it
give
him
the
opportunity
of
attack
our
Battery
of
Guns
;
which
he
perform
with
great
Slaughter
,
both
of
Gunners
and
Matrosses
:
<EOS>
He
at
the
same
time
inquire
,
who
'
twas
that
command
there
in
chief

<EOS>
I
inform
him

that

the
Oeconomy
of
the
train
exceed
well

<EOS>
as
for
that
,
he
know
nothing
of
;
but
that
he
would
vouch
,
he
behave
himself
with
extraordinary
courage
,
and
defend
the
Battery
to
the
utmost
extremity
,
receive
several
Wounds
,
and
deserve
the
Post
in
which
he
act
.
<EOS>

me
,
that
