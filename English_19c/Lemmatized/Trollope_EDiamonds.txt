Lizzie
Greystock
 
<EOS>
It
be
admit
by
all
her
friend
,
and
also
by
her
enemy
,
 
who
be
in
truth
the
more
numerous
and
active
body
of
the
two
,
 
that
Lizzie
Greystock
have
do
very
well
with
herself
.
<EOS>
We
will
tell
the
story
of
Lizzie
Greystock
from
the
beginning
,
but
we
will
not
dwell
over
it
at
great
length
,
as
we
may
do
if
we
love
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
only
child
of
old
Admiral
Greystock
,
who
in
the
latter
year
of
his
life
be
much
perplex
by
the
possession
of
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
admiral
be
a
man
who
like
whist
,
wine
,
 
and
wickedness
in
general
we
may
perhaps
say
,
and
whose
ambition
it
be
to
live
every
day
of
his
life
up
to
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
People
say
that
he
succeed
,
and
that
the
whist
,
wine
,
and
wickedness
be
there
,
at
the
side
even
of
his
die
bed
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
particular
fortune
,
and
yet
his
daughter
,
when
she
be
little
more
than
a
child
,
go
about
everywhere
with
jewel
on
her
finger
,
and
red
gem
hang
round
her
neck
,
and
yellow
gem
pendent
from
her
ear
,
and
white
gem
shine
in
her
black
hair
.
<EOS>
She
be
hardly
nineteen
when
her
father
die
and
she
be
take
home
by
that
dreadful
old
termagant
,
her
aunt
,
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
would
have
sooner
go
to
any
other
friend
or
relative
,
have
there
be
any
other
friend
or
relative
to
take
her
possess
of
a
house
in
town
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
,
Dean
Greystock
,
of
Bobsborough
,
would
have
have
her
,
and
a
more
good
-
natured
old
soul
than
the
dean
's
wife
do
not
exist
,
 
and
there
be
three
pleasant
,
good
-
temper
girl
in
the
deanery
,
who
have
make
various
little
effort
at
friendship
with
their
cousin
Lizzie
;
but
Lizzie
have
high
idea
for
herself
than
life
in
the
deanery
at
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
She
hate
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
during
her
father
's
lifetime
,
when
she
hope
to
be
able
to
settle
herself
before
his
death
,
she
be
not
in
the
habit
of
conceal
her
hatred
for
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
be
not
indeed
amiable
or
easily
manage
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
admiral
die
,
Lizzie
do
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
in
go
to
the
old
"
vulturess
,
"
as
she
be
in
the
habit
of
call
the
countess
in
her
occasional
correspondence
with
the
girl
at
Bobsborough
.
  
<EOS>
the
admiral
die
greatly
in
debt
;
 
so
much
so
that
it
be
a
marvel
how
tradesman
have
trust
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
literally
nothing
leave
for
anybody
,
 
and
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
of
Old
Bond
Street
condescend
to
call
at
Lady
Linlithgow
's
house
in
Brook
Street
,
and
to
beg
that
the
jewel
supply
during
the
last
twelve
month
may
be
return
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
protest
that
there
be
no
jewel
,
 
nothing
to
signify
,
nothing
worth
restore
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
have
see
the
diamond
,
and
demand
an
explanation
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
"
part
with
,
"
by
the
admiral
's
order
,
 
so
say
Lizzie
,
 
for
the
payment
of
other
debt
.
<EOS>
of
this
Lady
Linlithgow
do
not
believe
a
word
,
but
she
could
not
get
at
any
exact
truth
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
the
jewel
be
in
very
truth
pawn
for
money
which
have
be
necessary
for
Lizzie
's
need
.
<EOS>
certain
thing
must
be
pay
for
,
 
one
's
own
maid
for
instance
;
and
one
must
have
some
money
in
one
's
pocket
for
railway
-
train
and
little
knick
-
knack
which
can
not
be
have
on
credit
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
when
she
be
nineteen
know
how
to
do
without
money
as
well
as
most
girl
;
but
there
be
call
which
she
could
not
withstand
,
debt
which
even
she
must
pay
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
,
however
,
drop
her
acquaintance
with
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
before
her
father
have
be
dead
eight
month
,
she
be
closet
with
Mr.
Benjamin
,
transact
a
little
business
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
come
to
him
,
she
tell
him
,
the
moment
she
be
of
age
,
and
be
willing
to
make
herself
responsible
for
the
debt
,
sign
any
bill
,
note
,
or
document
which
the
firm
may
demand
from
her
,
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
have
nothing
of
her
own
,
and
never
would
have
anything
.
<EOS>
that
Mr.
Benjamin
know
.
<EOS>
as
for
payment
of
the
debt
by
Lady
Linlithgow
,
who
for
a
countess
be
as
poor
as
Job
,
Mr.
Benjamin
,
she
be
quite
sure
,
do
not
expect
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
but
 
then
Lizzie
pause
,
and
Mr.
Benjamin
,
with
the
sweetest
and
witty
of
smile
,
suggest
that
perhaps
Miss
Greystock
be
go
to
be
marry
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
with
a
pretty
maiden
blush
,
admit
that
such
a
catastrophe
be
probable
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
ask
in
marriage
by
Sir
Florian
Eustace
.
<EOS>
now
Mr.
Benjamin
know
,
as
all
the
world
know
,
that
Sir
Florian
Eustace
be
a
very
rich
man
indeed
;
a
man
in
no
degree
embarrass
,
and
who
could
pay
any
amount
of
jeweller
"
bill
for
which
claim
may
be
make
upon
him
.
<EOS>
well
;
what
do
Miss
Greystock
want
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
do
not
suppose
that
Miss
Greystock
be
actuate
simply
by
a
desire
to
have
her
old
bill
pay
by
her
future
husband
.
<EOS>
Miss
Greystock
want
a
loan
sufficient
to
take
the
jewel
out
of
pawn
.
<EOS>
She
would
then
make
herself
responsible
for
the
full
amount
due
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
say
that
he
would
make
a
few
inquiry
.
"
<EOS>
but
you
will
not
betray
me
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
"
for
the
match
may
be
off
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
promise
to
be
more
than
cautious
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
so
much
of
falsehood
as
may
have
be
expect
in
the
statement
which
Lizzie
Greystock
make
to
the
jeweller
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
true
that
she
be
of
age
,
and
therefore
no
future
husband
would
be
legally
liable
for
any
debt
which
she
may
then
contract
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
true
that
Sir
Florian
Eustace
have
ask
her
in
marriage
.
<EOS>
those
two
little
blemish
in
her
statement
must
be
admit
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
true
that
Sir
Florian
be
at
her
foot
,
and
that
by
a
proper
use
of
her
various
charm
,
 
the
pawn
jewel
include
,
 
she
may
bring
him
to
an
offer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
make
his
inquiry
,
and
accede
to
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
tell
Miss
Greystock
that
she
have
lie
to
him
in
that
matter
of
her
age
,
though
he
have
discover
the
lie
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
would
no
doubt
pay
the
bill
for
his
wife
without
any
argument
as
to
the
legality
of
the
claim
.
<EOS>
from
such
information
as
Mr.
Benjamin
could
acquire
he
think
that
there
would
be
a
marriage
,
and
that
the
speculation
be
on
the
whole
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
recover
her
jewel
and
Mr.
Benjamin
be
in
possession
of
a
promissory
note
purport
to
have
be
execute
by
a
person
who
be
no
longer
a
minor
.
<EOS>
the
jeweller
be
ultimately
successful
in
his
view
,
 
and
so
be
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
see
the
jewel
come
back
,
one
by
one
,
ring
add
to
ring
on
the
little
taper
finger
,
the
ruby
for
the
neck
,
and
the
pendent
yellow
earring
.
<EOS>
though
Lizzie
be
in
mourning
for
her
father
,
still
these
thing
be
allow
to
be
visible
.
<EOS>
the
countess
be
not
the
woman
to
see
them
without
inquiry
,
and
she
inquire
vigorously
.
<EOS>
She
threaten
,
storm
,
and
protest
.
<EOS>
She
attempt
even
a
raid
upon
the
young
lady
's
jewel
-
box
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
successful
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
snap
and
snarl
and
hold
her
own
,
 
for
at
that
time
the
match
with
Sir
Florian
be
near
its
accomplishment
,
and
the
countess
understand
too
well
the
value
of
such
a
disposition
of
her
niece
to
risk
it
at
the
moment
by
any
open
rupture
.
<EOS>
the
little
house
in
Brook
Street
,
 
for
the
house
be
very
small
and
very
comfortless
,
 
a
house
that
have
be
squeeze
in
,
as
it
be
,
between
two
other
without
any
fitting
space
for
it
,
 
do
not
contain
a
happy
family
.
<EOS>
one
bedroom
,
and
that
the
big
,
be
appropriate
to
the
Earl
of
Linlithgow
,
the
son
of
the
countess
,
a
young
man
who
pass
perhaps
five
night
in
town
during
the
year
.
<EOS>
other
inmate
there
be
none
besides
the
aunt
and
the
niece
and
the
four
servant
,
 
of
whom
one
be
Lizzie
's
own
maid
.
<EOS>
why
should
such
a
countess
have
trouble
herself
with
the
custody
of
such
a
niece
?
<EOS>
simply
because
the
countess
regard
it
as
a
duty
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
be
worldly
,
stingy
,
ill
-
tempered
,
selfish
,
and
mean
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
would
cheat
a
butcher
out
of
a
mutton
-
chop
,
or
a
cook
out
of
a
month
's
wage
,
if
she
could
do
so
with
some
slant
of
legal
wind
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
She
would
tell
any
number
of
lie
to
carry
a
point
in
what
she
believe
to
be
social
success
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
of
her
that
she
cheat
at
card
.
<EOS>
in
back
-
biting
,
no
venomous
old
woman
between
Bond
Street
and
Park
Lane
could
beat
her
,
 
or
,
more
wonderful
still
,
no
venomous
old
man
at
the
club
.
<EOS>
but
nevertheless
she
recognise
certain
duty
,
 
and
perform
them
,
though
she
hate
them
.
<EOS>
She
go
to
church
,
not
merely
that
people
may
see
her
there
,
 
as
to
which
in
truth
she
care
nothing
,
 
but
because
she
think
it
be
right
.
<EOS>
and
she
take
in
Lizzie
Greystock
,
whom
she
hate
almost
as
much
as
she
do
sermon
,
because
the
admiral
's
wife
have
be
her
sister
,
and
she
recognise
a
duty
.
<EOS>
but
,
have
thus
bind
herself
to
Lizzie
,
 
who
be
a
beauty
,
 
of
course
it
become
the
first
object
of
her
life
to
get
rid
of
Lizzie
by
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
and
,
though
she
would
have
like
to
think
that
Lizzie
would
be
torment
all
her
day
,
though
she
thoroughly
believe
that
Lizzie
deserve
to
be
torment
,
she
set
her
heart
upon
a
splendid
match
.
<EOS>
She
would
at
any
rate
be
able
to
throw
it
daily
in
her
niece
's
tooth
that
the
splendour
be
of
her
do
.
<EOS>
now
a
marriage
with
Sir
Florian
Eustace
would
be
very
splendid
,
and
therefore
she
be
unable
to
go
into
the
matter
of
the
jewel
with
that
rigour
which
in
other
circumstance
she
would
certainly
have
display
.
  
<EOS>
the
match
with
Sir
Florian
Eustace
,
 
for
a
match
<EOS>
it
come
to
be
,
 
be
certainly
very
splendid
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
be
a
young
man
about
eight
-
and
-
twenty
,
very
handsome
,
of
immense
wealth
,
quite
unencumbered
,
move
in
the
good
circle
,
popular
,
so
far
prudent
that
he
never
risk
his
fortune
on
the
turf
or
in
gambling
-
house
,
with
the
reputation
of
a
gallant
soldier
,
and
a
most
devoted
lover
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
fact
concern
him
which
may
,
or
may
not
,
be
take
as
objection
.
<EOS>
He
be
vicious
,
and
 
he
be
die
.
<EOS>
when
a
friend
,
intend
to
be
kind
,
hint
the
latter
circumstance
to
Lady
Linlithgow
,
the
countess
blinked
and
wink
and
nod
,
and
then
swear
that
she
have
procure
medical
advice
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
medical
advice
declare
that
Sir
Florian
be
not
more
likely
to
die
than
another
man
,
 
if
only
he
would
get
married
;
all
of
which
statement
on
her
ladyship
's
part
be
a
lie
.
<EOS>
when
the
same
friend
hint
the
same
thing
to
Lizzie
herself
,
Lizzie
resolve
that
she
would
have
her
revenge
upon
that
friend
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
the
courtship
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
say
that
Sir
Florian
be
vicious
;
 
but
he
be
not
altogether
a
bad
man
,
nor
be
he
vicious
in
the
common
sense
of
the
word
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
who
deny
himself
no
pleasure
,
let
the
cost
be
what
it
may
in
health
,
pocket
,
or
moral
.
<EOS>
of
sin
or
wickedness
he
have
probably
no
distinct
idea
.
<EOS>
in
virtue
,
as
an
attribute
of
the
world
around
him
,
he
have
no
belief
.
<EOS>
of
honour
he
think
very
much
,
and
have
conceive
a
somewhat
noble
idea
that
because
much
have
be
give
to
him
much
be
demand
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
haughty
,
polite
,
 
and
very
generous
.
<EOS>
there
be
almost
a
nobility
even
about
his
vice
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
a
special
gallantry
of
which
it
be
hard
to
say
whether
it
be
or
be
not
to
be
admire
.
<EOS>
They
tell
him
that
he
be
like
to
die
,
 
very
like
to
die
,
if
he
do
not
change
his
manner
of
living
.
<EOS>
Would
he
go
to
Algiers
for
a
period
?
<EOS>
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
if
he
die
,
there
be
his
brother
John
leave
to
succeed
him
.
<EOS>
and
the
fear
of
death
never
cast
a
cloud
over
that
grandly
beautiful
brow
.
<EOS>
They
have
all
be
short
-
live
,
 
the
Eustaces
.
<EOS>
consumption
have
sweep
a
hecatomb
of
victim
from
the
family
.
<EOS>
but
still
they
be
grand
people
,
and
never
be
afraid
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
Sir
Florian
fall
in
love
.
<EOS>
discuss
this
matter
with
his
brother
,
who
be
perhaps
his
only
intimate
friend
,
he
declare
that
if
the
girl
he
love
would
give
herself
to
him
,
he
would
make
what
atonement
he
could
to
her
for
his
own
early
death
by
a
princely
settlement
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
,
who
be
somewhat
nearly
concerned
in
the
matter
,
raise
no
objection
to
this
proposal
.
<EOS>
there
be
ever
something
grand
about
these
Eustaces
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
be
a
grand
gentleman
;
but
surely
he
must
have
be
dull
of
intellect
,
slow
of
discernment
,
blear
-
eyed
in
his
way
about
the
town
,
<EOS>
when
he
take
Lizzie
Greystock
,
 
of
all
the
woman
whom
he
could
find
in
the
world
,
 
to
be
the
pure
,
the
true
,
and
the
noblest
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
of
Sir
Florian
that
he
do
not
believe
in
virtue
.
<EOS>
He
freely
express
disbelief
in
the
virtue
of
woman
around
him
,
 
in
the
virtue
of
woman
of
all
rank
.
<EOS>
but
he
believe
in
his
mother
and
sister
as
though
they
be
heaven
-
bear
;
and
he
be
one
who
could
believe
in
his
wife
as
though
she
be
the
queen
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
He
do
believe
in
Lizzie
Greystock
,
think
that
intellect
,
purity
,
truth
,
and
beauty
,
each
perfect
in
its
degree
,
be
combine
in
her
.
<EOS>
the
intellect
and
beauty
be
there
;
 
but
,
for
the
purity
and
truth
 
;
how
could
it
have
be
that
such
a
one
as
Sir
Florian
Eustace
should
have
be
so
blind
!
  
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
be
not
,
indeed
,
a
clever
man
;
but
he
believe
himself
to
be
a
fool
.
<EOS>
and
believe
himself
to
be
a
fool
,
he
desire
,
nay
,
painfully
long
,
for
some
of
those
result
of
cleverness
which
may
,
he
think
,
come
to
him
,
from
contact
with
a
clever
woman
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
read
poetry
well
,
and
she
read
verse
to
him
,
 
sit
very
near
to
him
,
almost
in
the
dark
,
with
a
shaded
lamp
throw
its
light
on
her
book
.
<EOS>
He
be
astonish
to
find
how
sweet
a
thing
be
poetry
.
<EOS>
by
himself
he
could
never
read
a
line
,
but
as
it
come
from
her
lip
it
seem
to
charm
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
new
pleasure
,
and
one
which
,
though
he
have
ridicule
it
,
he
have
so
often
covet
!
<EOS>
and
then
she
tell
him
of
such
wondrous
thought
,
 
such
wondrous
joy
in
the
world
which
would
come
from
think
!
<EOS>
He
be
proud
,
I
have
say
,
and
haughty
;
but
he
be
essentially
modest
and
humble
in
his
self
-
estimation
.
<EOS>
how
divine
be
this
creature
,
whose
voice
to
him
be
as
that
of
a
goddess
!
  
<EOS>
then
he
speak
out
to
her
,
with
his
face
a
little
turn
from
her
.
<EOS>
Would
she
be
his
wife
?
<EOS>
but
,
before
she
answer
him
,
let
her
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
They
have
tell
him
that
an
early
death
must
probably
be
his
fate
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
himself
feel
that
it
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
be
ill
,
 
very
ill
;
but
often
he
be
well
.
<EOS>
if
she
would
run
the
risk
with
him
he
would
endeavour
to
make
her
such
recompense
as
may
come
from
his
wealth
.
<EOS>
the
speech
he
make
be
somewhat
long
,
and
as
he
make
it
he
hardly
look
into
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
necessary
to
him
that
he
should
be
make
to
know
by
some
signal
from
her
how
it
be
go
with
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
as
he
speak
of
his
danger
,
there
come
a
gurgle
little
trill
of
wail
from
her
throat
,
a
soft
,
almost
musical
sound
of
woe
,
which
seem
to
add
an
unaccustomed
eloquence
to
his
word
.
<EOS>
when
he
speak
of
his
own
hope
the
sound
be
somewhat
change
,
but
it
be
still
continue
.
<EOS>
when
he
allude
to
the
disposition
of
his
fortune
,
she
be
at
his
foot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
not
that
,
"
she
say
,
"
not
that
!
"
<EOS>
He
lift
her
,
and
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
he
try
to
tell
her
what
it
would
be
his
duty
to
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
escape
from
his
arm
and
would
not
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
 
but
 
!
<EOS>
when
he
begin
to
talk
of
love
again
,
she
stand
with
her
forehead
bow
against
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
of
course
the
engagement
be
then
a
thing
accomplish
.
  
<EOS>
but
still
the
cup
may
slip
from
her
lip
.
<EOS>
Her
father
be
now
dead
but
ten
month
,
and
what
answer
could
she
make
when
the
common
pressing
petition
for
an
early
marriage
be
pour
into
her
ear
?
<EOS>
this
be
in
July
,
and
it
would
never
do
that
he
should
be
leave
,
unmarrie
,
to
the
rigour
of
another
winter
.
<EOS>
She
look
into
his
face
and
know
that
she
have
cause
for
fear
.
<EOS>
oh
,
heavens
!
<EOS>
if
all
these
golden
hope
should
fall
to
the
ground
,
and
she
should
come
to
be
know
only
as
the
girl
who
have
be
engage
to
the
late
Sir
Florian
!
<EOS>
but
he
himself
press
the
marriage
on
the
same
ground
.
<EOS>
"
They
tell
me
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
I
have
better
get
a
little
south
by
the
beginning
of
October
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
alone
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
mean
;
 
eh
,
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
"
of
course
she
marry
him
in
September
.
  
<EOS>
They
spend
a
honeymoon
of
six
week
at
a
place
he
have
in
Scotland
,
and
the
first
blow
come
upon
him
as
they
pass
through
London
,
back
from
Scotland
,
on
their
way
to
Italy
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
send
in
their
little
bill
,
which
amount
to
something
over
£
400
,
and
other
little
bill
be
send
in
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
be
a
man
by
whom
such
bill
would
certainly
be
pay
,
but
by
whom
they
would
not
be
pay
without
his
understanding
much
and
conceive
more
as
to
their
cause
and
nature
.
<EOS>
how
much
he
really
do
understand
she
be
never
quite
aware
;
 
but
she
do
know
that
he
detect
her
in
a
positive
falsehood
.
<EOS>
She
may
certainly
have
manage
the
matter
better
than
she
do
;
and
have
she
admit
everything
there
may
probably
have
be
but
few
word
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
,
however
,
understand
the
nature
of
the
note
she
have
sign
,
and
think
that
simply
new
bill
would
be
present
by
the
jeweller
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
give
a
false
account
of
the
transaction
,
and
the
lie
be
detect
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
she
care
very
much
.
<EOS>
as
she
be
utterly
devoid
of
true
tenderness
,
so
also
be
she
devoid
of
conscience
.
<EOS>
They
go
abroad
,
however
;
and
by
the
time
the
winter
be
half
over
in
Naples
<EOS>
,
he
know
what
his
wife
be
;
 
and
before
the
end
of
the
spring
he
be
dead
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
so
far
play
her
game
well
,
and
have
win
her
stake
.
<EOS>
what
regret
,
what
remorse
she
suffer
when
she
know
that
he
be
go
from
her
,
 
and
then
know
that
he
be
go
,
who
can
say
?
<EOS>
as
man
be
never
strong
enough
to
take
unmixed
delight
in
good
,
so
may
we
presume
also
that
he
can
not
be
quite
so
weak
as
to
find
perfect
satisfaction
in
evil
.
<EOS>
there
must
have
be
qualm
as
she
look
at
his
die
face
,
sour
with
the
disappointment
she
have
bring
upon
him
,
and
listen
to
the
harsh
querulous
voice
that
be
no
longer
eager
in
the
expression
of
love
.
<EOS>
there
must
have
be
some
pang
when
she
reflect
that
the
cruel
wrong
which
she
have
inflict
on
him
have
probably
hurry
him
to
his
grave
.
<EOS>
as
a
widow
,
in
the
first
solemnity
of
her
widowhood
,
she
be
wretched
and
would
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
then
she
return
to
England
and
shut
herself
up
in
a
small
house
at
Brighton
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
offer
to
go
to
her
,
but
she
beg
that
she
may
be
leave
to
herself
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
short
month
the
awe
arise
from
the
rapidity
with
which
it
have
all
occur
do
afflict
her
.
<EOS>
twelve
month
since
she
have
hardly
know
the
man
who
be
to
be
her
husband
.
<EOS>
now
she
be
a
widow
,
 
a
widow
very
richly
endow
,
 
and
she
bear
beneath
her
bosom
<EOS>
the
fruit
of
her
husband
's
love
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
even
in
these
early
day
,
friend
and
enemy
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
Lizzie
Greystock
have
do
very
well
with
herself
;
for
it
be
know
by
all
concern
that
in
the
settlement
make
she
have
be
treat
with
unwonted
generosity
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
 
<EOS>
there
be
circumstance
in
her
position
which
make
it
impossible
that
Lizzie
Greystock
,
 
or
Lady
Eustace
,
as
we
must
now
call
her
,
 
should
be
leave
altogether
to
herself
in
the
modest
widow
's
retreat
which
she
have
find
at
Brighton
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
April
,
and
it
be
know
that
if
all
thing
go
well
with
her
,
she
would
be
a
mother
before
the
summer
be
over
.
<EOS>
on
what
the
Fates
may
ordain
in
this
matter
immense
interest
be
dependent
.
<EOS>
if
a
son
should
be
bear
he
would
inherit
everything
,
subject
,
of
course
,
to
his
mother
's
settlement
.
<EOS>
if
a
daughter
,
to
her
would
belong
the
great
personal
wealth
which
Sir
Florian
have
own
at
the
time
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
Should
there
be
no
son
,
John
Eustace
,
the
brother
,
would
inherit
the
estate
in
Yorkshire
which
have
be
the
backbone
of
the
Eustace
wealth
.
<EOS>
Should
no
child
be
bear
,
John
Eustace
would
inherit
everything
that
have
not
be
settle
upon
or
leave
to
the
widow
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
have
make
a
settlement
immediately
before
his
marriage
,
and
a
will
immediately
afterwards
.
<EOS>
of
what
he
have
do
then
,
nothing
have
be
alter
in
those
sad
italian
day
.
<EOS>
the
settlement
have
be
very
generous
.
<EOS>
the
whole
property
in
Scotland
be
to
belong
to
Lizzie
for
her
life
,
 
and
after
her
death
be
to
go
to
a
second
son
,
if
such
second
son
there
should
be
.
<EOS>
by
the
will
money
be
leave
to
her
,
more
than
would
be
need
for
any
possible
temporary
emergency
.
<EOS>
when
she
know
how
it
be
all
arrange
,
 
as
far
as
she
do
know
it
,
 
<EOS>
she
be
aware
that
she
be
a
rich
woman
.
<EOS>
for
so
clever
a
woman
she
be
infinitely
ignorant
as
to
the
possession
and
value
of
money
and
land
and
income
,
 
though
,
perhaps
,
not
more
ignorant
than
be
most
young
girl
under
twenty
-
one
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
Scotch
property
,
 
she
think
that
it
be
her
own
,
for
ever
,
because
there
could
not
now
be
a
second
son
,
 
and
yet
be
not
quite
sure
whether
it
would
be
her
own
at
all
if
she
have
no
son
.
<EOS>
concern
that
sum
of
money
leave
to
her
,
she
do
not
know
whether
it
be
to
come
out
of
the
Scotch
property
or
be
give
to
her
separately
,
 
and
whether
it
be
to
come
annually
or
to
come
only
once
.
<EOS>
She
have
receive
,
while
still
in
Naples
,
a
letter
from
the
family
lawyer
,
give
her
such
detail
of
the
will
as
it
be
necessary
that
she
should
know
,
and
now
she
long
to
ask
question
,
to
have
her
belonging
make
plain
to
her
,
and
to
realise
her
wealth
.
<EOS>
She
have
brilliant
prospect
;
and
yet
,
through
it
all
,
there
be
a
sense
of
loneliness
that
nearly
kill
her
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
have
be
much
well
if
her
husband
have
live
,
and
still
worship
her
,
and
still
allow
her
to
read
poetry
to
him
?
<EOS>
but
she
have
read
no
poetry
to
him
after
that
affair
of
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
have
,
or
will
have
,
but
little
to
do
with
these
day
,
and
may
be
hurry
on
through
the
twelve
,
or
even
twenty
-
four
month
which
follow
the
death
of
poor
Sir
Florian
.
<EOS>
the
question
of
the
heirship
,
however
,
be
very
grave
,
and
early
in
the
month
of
May
Lady
Eustace
be
visit
by
her
husband
's
uncle
,
Bishop
Eustace
,
of
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
have
be
the
young
brother
of
Sir
Florian
's
father
,
 
be
at
this
time
a
man
about
fifty
,
very
active
and
very
popular
,
 
and
be
one
who
stand
high
in
the
world
,
even
among
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
suggest
to
his
niece
-
in
-
law
that
it
be
very
expedient
that
,
during
her
come
hour
of
trial
,
she
should
not
absent
herself
from
her
husband
's
family
,
and
at
last
persuade
her
to
take
up
her
residence
at
the
palace
at
Bobsborough
till
such
time
as
the
event
should
be
over
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
be
take
to
the
palace
,
and
in
due
time
a
son
be
bear
.
<EOS>
John
,
who
be
now
the
uncle
of
the
heir
,
come
down
,
and
,
with
the
frank
good
humour
,
declare
that
he
would
devote
himself
to
the
little
head
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
leave
as
guardian
,
and
the
management
of
the
great
family
estate
be
to
be
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
read
no
poetry
to
him
,
and
he
have
never
like
her
,
and
the
bishop
do
not
like
her
,
and
the
lady
of
the
bishop
's
family
dislike
her
very
much
,
and
it
be
think
by
them
that
the
dean
's
people
,
 
the
Dean
of
Bobsborough
be
Lizzie
's
uncle
,
 
be
not
very
fond
of
Lizzie
since
Lizzie
have
so
raise
herself
in
the
world
as
to
want
no
assistance
from
them
.
<EOS>
but
still
they
be
bind
to
do
their
duty
by
her
as
the
widow
of
the
late
and
the
mother
of
the
present
baronet
.
<EOS>
and
they
do
not
find
much
cause
of
complain
as
to
Lizzie
's
conduct
in
these
day
.
<EOS>
in
that
matter
of
the
great
family
diamond
necklace
,
 
which
certainly
should
not
have
be
take
to
Naples
at
all
,
and
as
to
which
the
jeweller
have
tell
the
lawyer
and
the
lawyer
have
tell
John
Eustace
that
it
certainly
should
not
now
be
detain
among
the
widow
's
own
private
property
,
 
the
bishop
strongly
recommend
that
nothing
should
be
say
at
present
.
<EOS>
the
mistake
,
if
there
be
a
mistake
,
could
be
remedie
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
and
nothing
in
those
very
early
day
be
say
about
the
great
Eustace
necklace
,
which
afterwards
become
so
famous
.
  
<EOS>
why
Lizzie
should
have
be
so
generally
dislike
by
the
Eustaces
,
it
may
be
hard
to
explain
.
<EOS>
while
she
remain
at
the
palace
she
be
very
discreet
,
 
and
perhaps
demure
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
say
they
dislike
her
express
determination
to
cut
her
aunt
,
Lady
Linlithgow
;
 
for
they
know
that
Lady
Linlithgow
have
be
,
at
any
rate
,
a
friend
to
Lizzie
Greystock
.
<EOS>
there
be
people
who
can
be
wise
within
a
certain
margin
,
but
beyond
that
commit
great
imprudence
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
submit
herself
to
the
palace
people
for
that
period
of
her
prostration
,
but
she
could
not
hold
her
tongue
as
to
her
future
intention
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
too
,
now
and
then
ask
of
Mrs.
Eustace
,
and
even
of
her
daughter
,
an
eager
,
anxious
question
about
her
own
property
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
die
to
handle
her
money
,
"
say
Mrs.
Eustace
to
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
only
like
the
rest
of
the
world
in
that
,
"
say
the
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
if
she
would
be
really
open
,
I
would
not
mind
it
,
"
say
Mrs.
Eustace
.
<EOS>
none
of
them
like
her
,
 
and
she
do
not
like
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
remain
at
the
palace
for
six
month
,
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
go
to
her
own
place
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Eustace
have
strongly
advise
her
to
ask
her
aunt
,
Lady
Linlithgow
,
to
accompany
her
,
but
in
refuse
to
do
this
,
Lizzie
be
quite
firm
.
<EOS>
She
have
endure
Lady
Linlithgow
for
that
year
between
her
father
's
death
and
her
marriage
;
she
be
now
begin
to
dare
to
hope
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
good
thing
which
she
have
win
,
and
the
presence
of
the
dowager
-
countess
,
 
"
the
vulturess
,
"
 
be
certainly
not
one
of
these
good
thing
.
<EOS>
in
what
her
enjoyment
be
to
consist
,
she
have
not
as
yet
quite
form
a
definite
conclusion
.
<EOS>
She
like
jewel
.
<EOS>
She
like
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
like
the
power
of
be
arrogant
to
those
around
her
.
<EOS>
and
she
like
good
thing
to
eat
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
other
matter
that
be
also
dear
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
do
like
music
,
 
though
it
may
be
doubt
whether
she
would
ever
play
it
or
even
listen
to
it
alone
.
<EOS>
She
do
like
reading
,
and
especially
the
reading
of
poetry
,
 
though
even
in
this
she
be
false
and
pretentious
,
skipping
,
pretend
to
have
read
,
lie
about
book
,
and
make
up
her
market
of
literature
for
outside
admiration
at
the
easy
possible
cost
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
some
dream
of
be
in
love
,
and
would
take
delight
even
in
build
castle
in
the
air
,
which
she
would
people
with
friend
and
lover
whom
she
would
make
happy
with
the
most
open
-
hearted
benevolence
.
<EOS>
She
have
theoretical
idea
of
life
which
be
not
bad
,
 
but
in
practice
,
she
have
gain
her
object
,
and
she
be
in
a
hurry
to
have
liberty
to
enjoy
them
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
considerable
anxiety
in
the
palace
in
reference
to
the
future
mode
of
life
of
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
for
that
baby
-
heir
,
of
course
there
would
have
be
no
cause
for
interference
;
but
the
right
of
that
baby
be
so
serious
and
important
that
it
be
almost
impossible
not
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
the
mother
,
however
,
give
some
little
sign
that
she
do
not
intend
to
submit
to
much
interference
,
and
there
be
no
real
reason
why
she
should
not
be
as
free
as
air
.
<EOS>
but
do
she
really
intend
to
go
down
to
Portray
Castle
all
alone
;
 
that
is
,
with
her
baby
and
nurse
?
<EOS>
this
be
end
by
an
arrangement
,
in
accordance
with
which
she
be
accompany
by
her
eld
cousin
,
Ellinor
Greystock
,
a
lady
who
be
just
ten
year
her
senior
.
<EOS>
there
could
hardly
be
a
well
woman
than
Ellinor
Greystock
,
 
or
a
more
good
-
humoured
,
kindly
be
.
<EOS>
after
many
debate
in
the
deanery
and
in
the
palace
,
 
for
there
be
much
friendship
between
the
two
ecclesiastical
establishment
,
 
the
offer
be
make
and
the
advice
give
.
<EOS>
Ellinor
have
accept
the
martyrdom
on
the
understanding
that
if
the
advice
be
accept
she
be
to
remain
at
Portray
Castle
for
three
month
.
<EOS>
after
a
long
discussion
between
Lady
Eustace
and
the
bishop
's
wife
<EOS>
the
offer
be
accept
,
and
the
two
lady
go
to
Scotland
together
.
  
<EOS>
during
those
three
month
the
widow
still
bide
her
time
.
<EOS>
of
her
future
idea
of
life
she
say
not
a
word
to
her
companion
.
<EOS>
of
her
infant
she
say
very
little
.
<EOS>
She
would
talk
of
book
,
 
choose
such
book
as
her
cousin
do
not
read
;
and
she
would
interlard
her
conversation
with
much
Italian
,
because
her
cousin
do
not
know
the
language
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
carriage
keep
by
the
widow
,
and
they
have
themselves
drive
out
together
.
<EOS>
of
real
companionship
there
be
none
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
bide
her
time
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
three
month
Miss
Greystock
thankfully
,
and
,
indeed
,
of
necessity
,
return
to
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
no
good
,
"
she
say
to
her
mother
,
"
and
have
be
very
uncomfortable
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
her
mother
,
"
we
have
dispose
of
three
month
out
of
a
two
year
"
period
of
danger
.
<EOS>
in
two
year
from
Sir
Florian
's
death
she
will
be
marry
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
this
be
say
Lizzie
have
be
a
widow
nearly
a
year
,
and
have
bide
her
time
upon
the
whole
discreetly
.
<EOS>
some
foolish
letter
she
have
write
,
 
chiefly
to
the
lawyer
about
her
money
and
property
;
and
some
foolish
thing
she
have
say
,
 
as
when
she
tell
Ellinor
Greystock
that
the
Portray
property
be
her
own
for
ever
,
to
do
what
she
like
with
it
.
<EOS>
the
sum
of
money
leave
to
her
by
her
husband
have
by
that
time
be
pay
into
her
own
hand
,
and
she
have
open
a
banker
's
account
.
<EOS>
the
revenue
from
the
Scotch
estate
,
 
some
£
4,000
a
year
,
 
be
clearly
her
own
for
life
.
<EOS>
the
family
diamond
-
necklace
be
still
in
her
possession
,
and
no
answer
have
be
give
by
her
to
a
postscript
to
a
lawyer
's
letter
in
which
a
little
advice
have
be
give
respect
it
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
another
year
,
when
she
have
just
reach
the
age
of
twenty
-
two
,
and
have
complete
her
second
year
of
widowhood
,
she
be
still
Lady
Eustace
,
thus
contradict
the
prophecy
make
by
the
dean
's
wife
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
spring
,
and
she
have
a
house
of
her
own
in
London
.
<EOS>
She
have
break
openly
with
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
She
have
oppose
,
though
not
absolutely
refuse
,
all
overture
of
brotherly
care
from
John
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
have
decline
a
further
invitation
,
both
for
herself
and
for
her
child
,
to
the
palace
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
positively
assert
her
intention
of
keep
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
Her
late
husband
,
she
say
,
have
give
the
diamond
to
her
.
<EOS>
as
they
be
suppose
to
be
worth
£
10,000
,
and
be
really
family
diamond
,
the
matter
be
feel
by
all
concern
to
be
one
of
much
importance
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
oppress
by
a
heavy
load
of
ignorance
,
which
become
serious
from
the
isolation
of
her
position
.
<EOS>
She
have
learn
to
draw
cheque
,
but
she
have
no
other
correct
notion
as
to
business
.
<EOS>
She
know
nothing
as
to
spend
money
,
save
it
,
or
invest
it
.
<EOS>
though
she
be
clever
,
sharp
,
and
greedy
,
she
have
no
idea
what
her
money
would
do
,
and
what
it
would
not
;
and
there
be
no
one
whom
she
would
trust
to
tell
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
young
cousin
,
a
barrister
,
 
a
son
of
the
dean
's
,
whom
she
perhaps
like
better
than
any
other
of
her
relation
,
 
but
she
decline
advice
even
from
her
friend
the
barrister
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
no
dealing
on
her
own
behalf
with
the
old
family
solicitor
of
the
Eustaces
,
 
the
gentleman
who
have
now
apply
very
formally
for
the
restitution
of
the
diamond
;
but
have
appoint
other
solicitor
to
act
for
her
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Mowbray
and
Mopus
be
of
opinion
that
as
the
diamond
have
be
give
into
her
hand
by
her
husband
without
any
term
as
to
their
surrender
,
no
one
could
claim
them
.
<EOS>
of
the
manner
in
which
the
diamond
have
be
place
in
her
hand
,
no
one
know
more
than
she
choose
to
tell
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
she
start
with
her
house
in
town
,
 
a
modest
little
house
in
Mount
Street
,
near
the
park
,
 
just
two
year
after
her
husband
's
death
,
she
have
a
large
circle
of
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
the
Eustace
people
,
and
the
Greystock
people
,
and
even
the
Linlithgow
people
,
do
not
entirely
turn
their
back
on
her
.
<EOS>
the
countess
,
indeed
,
be
very
venomous
,
as
she
well
may
be
;
but
then
the
countess
be
know
for
her
venom
.
<EOS>
the
dean
and
his
family
be
still
anxious
that
she
should
be
encourage
to
discreet
living
,
and
,
though
they
fear
many
thing
,
think
that
they
have
no
ground
for
open
complaint
.
<EOS>
the
Eustace
people
be
forbear
,
and
hope
the
good
.
<EOS>
"
D
 
---
the
necklace
!
"
<EOS>
John
Eustace
have
say
,
and
the
bishop
unfortunately
have
hear
him
say
it
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
John
,
"
say
the
prelate
,
"
whatever
be
to
become
of
the
bauble
,
you
may
express
your
opinion
in
more
sensible
language
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
lordship
's
pardon
,
"
say
John
,
"
I
only
mean
to
say
that
I
think
we
should
not
trouble
ourselves
about
a
few
stone
.
<EOS>
"
but
the
family
lawyer
,
Mr.
Camperdown
,
would
by
no
mean
take
this
view
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
generally
think
that
the
young
widow
open
her
campaign
more
prudently
than
have
be
expect
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
as
so
much
have
be
say
of
the
character
and
fortune
and
special
circumstance
of
Lizzie
Greystock
,
who
become
Lady
Eustace
as
a
bride
,
and
Lady
Eustace
as
a
widow
and
a
mother
,
all
within
the
space
of
twelve
month
,
it
may
be
as
well
to
give
some
description
of
her
person
and
habit
,
such
as
they
be
at
the
period
in
which
our
story
be
suppose
to
have
its
commencement
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
understand
in
the
first
place
that
she
be
very
lovely
;
 
much
more
so
,
indeed
,
now
than
when
she
have
fascinate
Sir
Florian
.
<EOS>
She
be
small
,
but
tall
than
she
look
to
be
,
 
for
her
form
be
perfectly
symmetrical
.
<EOS>
Her
foot
and
hand
may
have
be
take
as
model
by
a
sculptor
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
be
lithe
,
and
soft
,
and
slim
,
and
slender
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
a
fault
it
be
this
,
 
that
it
have
in
it
too
much
of
movement
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
who
say
that
she
be
almost
snake
-
like
in
her
rapid
bending
and
the
almost
too
easy
gesture
of
her
body
;
for
she
be
much
give
to
action
,
and
to
the
expression
of
her
think
by
the
motion
of
her
limb
.
<EOS>
She
may
certainly
have
make
her
way
as
an
actress
,
have
fortune
call
upon
her
to
earn
her
bread
in
that
fashion
.
<EOS>
and
her
voice
would
have
suit
the
stage
.
<EOS>
It
be
powerful
when
she
call
upon
it
for
power
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
flexible
and
capable
of
much
pretence
at
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
could
bring
it
to
a
whisper
that
would
almost
melt
your
heart
with
tenderness
,
 
as
she
have
melt
Sir
Florian
's
,
when
she
sit
near
to
him
read
poetry
;
and
then
she
could
raise
it
to
a
pitch
of
indignant
wrath
befit
a
Lady
Macbeth
when
her
husband
venture
to
rebuke
her
.
<EOS>
and
her
ear
be
quite
correct
in
modulate
these
tone
.
<EOS>
She
know
,
 
and
it
must
have
be
by
instinct
,
for
her
culture
in
such
matter
<EOS>
be
small
,
 
how
to
use
her
voice
so
that
neither
its
tenderness
nor
its
wrath
should
be
misapply
.
<EOS>
there
be
piece
in
verse
that
she
could
read
,
 
thing
not
wondrously
good
in
themselves
,
 
so
that
she
would
ravish
you
;
and
she
would
so
look
at
you
as
she
do
it
that
you
would
hardly
dare
either
to
avert
your
eye
or
to
return
her
gaze
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
have
not
know
whether
to
do
the
one
thing
or
the
other
,
and
have
therefore
seize
her
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
oval
,
 
somewhat
long
than
an
oval
,
 
with
little
in
it
,
perhaps
nothing
in
it
,
of
that
brilliancy
of
colour
which
we
call
complexion
.
<EOS>
and
yet
the
shade
of
her
countenance
be
ever
change
between
the
soft
and
most
transparent
white
,
and
the
rich
,
mellowest
shade
of
brown
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
she
simulate
anger
,
 
she
be
almost
incapable
of
real
anger
,
 
that
she
would
succeed
in
call
the
thin
streak
of
pink
from
her
heart
,
to
show
that
there
be
blood
run
in
her
vein
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
,
which
be
nearly
black
,
 
but
in
truth
with
more
of
softness
and
of
lustre
than
ever
belong
to
hair
that
be
really
black
,
 
<EOS>
she
wear
bind
tight
round
<EOS>
her
perfect
forehead
,
with
one
long
love
-
lock
hang
over
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
the
form
of
her
head
be
so
good
that
she
could
dare
to
carry
it
without
a
chignon
,
or
any
adventitious
adjunct
from
an
artiste
's
shop
.
<EOS>
very
bitter
be
she
in
consequence
when
speak
of
the
head
-
gear
of
other
woman
.
<EOS>
Her
chin
be
perfect
in
its
round
,
not
over
long
,
 
as
be
the
case
with
so
many
such
face
,
utterly
spoil
the
symmetry
of
the
countenance
.
<EOS>
but
it
lack
a
dimple
,
and
therefore
lack
feminine
tenderness
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
be
perhaps
faulty
in
be
too
small
,
or
,
at
least
,
her
lip
be
too
thin
.
<EOS>
there
be
want
from
the
mouth
that
expression
of
eager
-
speak
truthfulness
which
full
lip
will
often
convey
.
<EOS>
Her
tooth
be
without
flaw
or
blemish
,
even
,
small
,
white
,
and
delicate
;
but
perhaps
they
be
show
too
often
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
be
small
,
but
strike
many
as
the
pretty
feature
of
her
face
,
so
exquisite
be
the
moulding
of
it
,
and
so
eloquent
and
so
graceful
the
slight
inflation
of
the
transparent
nostril
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
,
in
which
she
herself
think
that
the
lustre
of
her
beauty
lie
,
be
blue
and
clear
,
bright
as
cerulean
water
.
<EOS>
They
be
long
large
eye
,
 
but
very
dangerous
.
<EOS>
to
those
who
know
how
to
read
a
face
,
there
be
danger
plainly
write
in
them
.
<EOS>
poor
Sir
Florian
have
not
know
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
the
charm
of
her
face
do
not
lie
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
this
be
feel
by
many
even
who
could
not
read
the
book
fluently
.
<EOS>
They
be
too
expressive
,
too
loud
in
their
demand
for
attention
,
and
they
lack
tenderness
.
<EOS>
how
few
there
be
among
woman
,
few
perhaps
also
among
man
,
who
know
that
the
sweetest
,
softest
,
tender
,
truest
eye
which
a
woman
can
carry
in
her
head
be
green
in
colour
!
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
eye
be
not
tender
,
 
neither
be
they
true
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
surmount
by
the
most
wonderfully
pencil
eyebrow
that
ever
nature
unassiste
plant
on
a
woman
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
say
that
she
be
clever
.
<EOS>
We
must
add
that
she
have
in
truth
study
much
.
<EOS>
She
speak
French
,
understand
italian
,
and
read
german
.
<EOS>
She
play
well
on
the
harp
,
and
moderately
well
on
the
piano
.
<EOS>
She
sing
,
at
least
in
good
taste
and
in
tune
.
<EOS>
of
thing
to
be
learn
by
read
she
know
much
,
have
really
take
diligent
trouble
with
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
learn
much
poetry
by
heart
,
and
could
apply
it
.
<EOS>
She
forget
nothing
,
listen
to
everything
,
understand
quickly
,
and
be
desirous
to
show
not
only
as
a
beauty
but
as
a
wit
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
at
this
time
who
declare
that
she
be
simply
the
clever
and
the
handsome
woman
in
England
.
<EOS>
as
an
independent
young
woman
she
be
perhaps
one
of
the
rich
.
   
<EOS>
Lucy

<EOS>
although
the
first
two
chapter
of
this
new
history
have
be
devote
to
the
fortune
and
personal
attribute
of
Lady
Eustace
,
the
historian
beg
his
reader
not
to
believe
that
that
opulent
and
aristocratic
Becky
Sharp
be
to
assume
the
dignity
of
heroine
in
the
forthcoming
page
.
<EOS>
that
there
shall
be
any
heroine
the
historian
will
not
take
upon
himself
to
assert
;
but
if
there
be
a
heroine
,
that
heroine
shall
not
be
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
poor
Lizzie
Greystock
!
 
<EOS>
as
man
double
her
own
age
,
and
who
have
know
her
as
a
forward
,
capricious
,
spoilt
child
in
her
father
's
lifetime
,
would
still
call
her
.
<EOS>
She
do
so
many
thing
,
make
so
many
effort
,
cause
so
much
suffering
to
other
,
and
suffer
so
much
herself
throughout
the
scene
with
which
we
be
about
to
deal
,
that
the
story
can
hardly
be
tell
without
give
her
that
prominence
of
place
which
have
be
assign
to
her
in
the
last
two
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
nor
do
the
chronicler
dare
to
put
forward
Lucy
Morris
as
a
heroine
.
<EOS>
the
real
heroine
,
if
it
be
find
possible
to
arrange
her
drapery
for
her
becomingly
,
and
to
put
that
part
which
she
enact
into
properly
heroic
word
,
shall
stalk
in
among
us
at
some
considerably
late
period
of
the
narrative
,
when
the
writer
shall
have
accustom
himself
to
the
flow
of
word
,
and
have
work
himself
up
to
a
state
of
mind
fit
for
the
reception
of
noble
acting
and
noble
speaking
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
let
it
be
understand
that
poor
little
Lucy
Morris
be
a
governess
in
the
house
of
old
Lady
Fawn
,
when
our
beautiful
young
widow
establish
herself
in
Mount
Street
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
and
Lucy
Morris
have
know
each
other
for
many
year
,
 
have
indeed
be
child
together
,
 
there
have
be
some
old
family
friendship
between
the
Greystocks
and
the
Morrises
.
<EOS>
when
the
admiral
's
wife
be
live
,
Lucy
have
,
as
a
little
girl
of
eight
or
nine
,
be
her
guest
.
<EOS>
She
have
often
be
a
guest
at
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
when
Lady
Eustace
have
go
down
to
the
bishop
's
palace
at
Bobsborough
,
in
order
that
an
heir
to
the
Eustaces
may
be
bear
under
an
auspicious
roof
,
Lucy
Morris
be
with
the
Greystocks
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
who
be
a
year
young
than
Lizzie
,
have
at
that
time
be
an
orphan
for
the
last
four
year
.
<EOS>
She
too
have
be
leave
penniless
,
but
no
such
brilliant
future
await
her
as
that
which
Lizzie
have
earn
for
herself
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
countess
-
aunt
to
take
her
into
her
London
house
.
<EOS>
the
dean
and
the
dean
's
wife
and
the
dean
's
daughter
have
be
her
good
friend
,
but
they
be
not
friend
on
whom
she
could
be
dependent
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
no
way
connect
with
her
by
blood
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
at
the
age
of
eighteen
,
she
have
go
out
to
be
a
child
's
governess
.
<EOS>
then
old
Lady
Fawn
have
hear
of
her
virtue
,
 
Lady
Fawn
,
who
have
seven
unmarried
daughter
run
down
from
seven
-
and
-
twenty
to
thirteen
,
and
Lucy
Morris
have
be
hire
to
teach
English
,
french
,
german
,
and
something
of
music
to
the
two
young
Miss
Fawns
.
  
<EOS>
during
that
visit
at
the
deanery
,
when
the
heir
of
the
Eustaces
be
be
bear
,
Lucy
be
undergo
a
sort
of
probation
for
the
Fawn
establishment
.
<EOS>
the
propose
engagement
with
Lady
Fawn
be
think
to
be
a
great
thing
for
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
be
know
as
a
miracle
of
Virtue
,
Benevolence
,
and
Persistency
.
<EOS>
every
good
quality
that
she
possess
be
so
mark
as
to
be
worthy
of
be
express
with
a
capital
.
<EOS>
but
her
virtue
be
of
that
extraordinarily
high
character
that
there
be
no
weakness
in
them
,
 
no
get
over
them
,
no
pervert
them
with
folly
or
even
exaggeration
.
<EOS>
when
she
hear
of
the
excellency
of
Miss
Morris
from
the
dean
's
wife
,
and
then
,
after
minute
investigation
,
learn
the
exact
quality
of
the
young
lady
,
she
express
herself
willing
to
take
Lucy
into
her
house
on
special
condition
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
able
to
teach
music
up
to
a
certain
point
.
<EOS>
"
then
it
be
all
over
,
"
say
Lucy
to
the
dean
with
her
pretty
smile
,
 
that
smile
which
cause
all
the
old
and
middle
-
aged
man
to
fall
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
over
at
all
,
"
say
the
dean
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
get
four
month
.
<EOS>
Our
organist
be
about
as
good
a
teacher
as
there
be
in
England
.
<EOS>
You
be
clever
and
quick
,
and
he
shall
teach
you
.
"
<EOS>
so
Lucy
go
to
Bobsborough
,
and
be
afterwards
accept
by
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
while
she
be
at
the
deanery
there
spring
up
a
renew
friendship
between
her
and
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
chiefly
a
one
-
sided
friendship
;
for
Lucy
,
who
be
quick
and
unconsciously
capable
of
read
that
book
to
which
we
allude
in
a
previous
chapter
,
be
somewhat
afraid
of
the
rich
widow
.
<EOS>
and
when
Lizzie
talk
to
her
of
their
old
childish
day
,
and
quote
poetry
,
and
speak
of
thing
romantic
,
 
as
she
be
much
give
to
do
,
 
Lucy
feel
that
the
metal
do
not
ring
true
.
<EOS>
and
then
Lizzie
have
an
ugly
habit
of
abuse
all
her
other
friend
behind
their
back
.
<EOS>
now
Lucy
do
not
like
to
hear
the
Greystocks
abuse
,
and
would
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
,
<EOS>
you
little
minx
,
"
Lizzie
would
say
playfully
,
"
but
you
know
that
they
be
all
ass
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
by
no
mean
think
that
the
Greystocks
be
ass
,
and
be
very
strongly
of
opinion
that
one
of
them
be
as
far
remove
from
be
an
ass
as
any
human
being
she
have
ever
know
.
<EOS>
this
one
be
Frank
Greystock
,
the
barrister
.
<EOS>
of
Frank
Greystock
some
special
 
<EOS>
but
,
let
it
be
hope
,
very
short
 
description
must
be
give
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
for
the
present
it
will
be
sufficient
to
declare
that
,
during
that
short
Easter
holiday
which
he
spend
at
his
father
's
house
in
Bobsborough
,
he
find
Lucy
Morris
to
be
a
most
agreeable
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
remember
her
position
,
"
say
Mrs.
Dean
to
her
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
position
!
<EOS>
well
;
 
and
what
be
her
position
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
sweet
a
girl
as
ever
live
,
and
a
perfect
lady
.
<EOS>
but
with
a
governess
,
unless
you
mean
to
marry
her
,
you
should
be
more
careful
than
with
another
girl
,
because
you
may
do
her
such
a
world
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
Lady
Fawn
know
that
she
have
an
admirer
,
Lady
Fawn
would
not
let
her
come
into
her
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
Lady
Fawn
be
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
if
a
girl
be
admirable
,
of
course
she
will
be
admire
.
<EOS>
who
can
hinder
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
I
do
;
well
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
I
can
afford
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
mother
,
I
will
never
say
a
word
to
raise
a
hope
in
her
,
 
if
it
would
be
a
hope
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
of
course
it
would
be
a
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
never
say
any
such
word
to
her
,
 
unless
I
make
up
my
mind
that
I
can
afford
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frank
,
it
would
be
impossible
!
"
say
Mrs.
Dean
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
be
a
very
good
woman
,
but
she
have
aspiration
in
the
direction
of
filthy
lucre
on
behalf
of
her
child
,
or
at
least
on
behalf
of
this
special
child
,
and
she
do
think
it
would
be
very
nice
if
Frank
would
marry
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
a
long
time
ago
,
nearly
two
year
ago
;
and
many
grave
thing
have
get
themselves
transact
since
Lucy
's
visit
to
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
She
have
become
quite
an
old
and
an
accustomed
member
of
Lady
Fawn
's
family
.
<EOS>
the
young
Fawn
girl
be
not
yet
fifteen
,
and
it
be
understand
that
Lucy
be
to
remain
with
the
Fawns
for
some
quite
indefinite
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
's
eld
daughter
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
have
a
family
of
her
own
,
have
be
marry
ten
or
twelve
year
,
and
it
be
quite
probable
that
Lucy
may
be
transfer
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
fully
appreciate
her
treasure
,
and
be
,
and
ever
have
be
,
conscientiously
anxious
to
make
Lucy
's
life
happy
.
<EOS>
but
she
think
that
a
governess
should
not
be
desirous
of
marrying
,
at
any
rate
till
a
somewhat
advanced
period
of
life
.
<EOS>
a
governess
,
if
she
be
give
to
fall
in
love
,
could
hardly
perform
her
duty
in
life
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
not
to
be
a
governess
,
but
a
young
lady
free
from
the
embarrassing
necessity
of
earn
bread
,
free
to
have
a
lover
and
a
husband
,
would
be
upon
the
whole
nicer
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
nice
to
be
bear
to
£
10,000
a
year
than
to
have
to
wish
for
£
500
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
could
talk
excellent
sense
on
this
subject
by
the
hour
,
and
always
admit
that
much
be
due
to
a
governess
who
know
her
place
and
do
her
duty
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
fond
of
Lucy
Morris
,
and
treat
her
dependent
with
affectionate
consideration
;
 
but
she
do
not
approve
of
visit
from
Mr.
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
blush
up
to
the
eye
,
have
once
declare
that
she
desire
to
have
no
personal
visitor
at
Lady
Fawn
's
house
;
but
that
,
as
regard
her
own
friendship
,
the
matter
be
one
for
her
own
bosom
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Morris
,
"
Lady
Fawn
have
say
,
"
we
understand
each
other
so
perfectly
,
and
you
be
so
good
,
that
I
be
quite
sure
everything
will
be
as
it
ought
to
be
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
live
down
at
Richmond
all
the
year
through
,
in
a
large
old
-
fashioned
house
with
a
large
old
-
fashioned
garden
,
call
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
after
that
speech
of
her
to
Lucy
,
Frank
Greystock
do
not
call
again
at
Fawn
Court
for
many
month
,
and
it
be
possible
that
her
ladyship
have
say
a
word
also
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Eustace
,
with
her
pretty
little
pair
of
grey
pony
,
would
sometimes
drive
down
to
Richmond
to
see
her
"
dear
little
old
friend
"
Lucy
,
and
her
visit
be
allow
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
express
an
opinion
among
her
daughter
that
she
do
not
see
any
harm
in
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
she
rather
like
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
but
then
Lady
Fawn
hate
Lady
Linlithgow
as
only
two
old
woman
can
hate
each
other
;
 
and
she
have
not
hear
the
story
of
the
diamond
necklace
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
certainly
be
a
treasure
,
 
a
treasure
though
no
heroine
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
sweetly
social
,
genial
little
human
be
whose
presence
in
the
house
be
ever
feel
to
be
like
sunshine
.
<EOS>
She
be
never
forward
,
but
never
bashful
.
<EOS>
She
be
always
open
to
familiar
intercourse
without
ever
put
herself
forward
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
man
or
woman
with
whom
she
would
not
so
talk
as
to
make
the
man
or
woman
feel
that
the
conversation
be
remarkably
pleasant
,
 
and
she
could
do
the
same
with
any
child
.
<EOS>
She
be
an
active
,
mindful

<EOS>
She

the
library

which
have
be
collect
by
the
late
Lord
Fawn
with
peculiar
reference
to
the
christian
theology
of
the
third
and
fourth
century
.
<EOS>
She
have
plan
the
new
flower
-
garden
,
 
though
Lady
Fawn
think
that
she
have
do
that
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
invaluable
during
Clara
Fawn
's
long
illness
.
<EOS>
She
know
every
rule
at
croquet
,
and
could
play
piquet
.
<EOS>
when
the
girl
get
up
charade
they
have
to
acknowledge
that
everything
depend
on
Miss
Morris
.
<EOS>
They
be
good
-
natured
,
plain
,
unattractive
girl
,
who
speak
of
her
to
her
face
as
one
who
could
easily
do
anything
to
which
she
may
put
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
do
really
love
her
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
the
eld
son
,
a
young
man
of
about
thirty
-
five
,
a
Peer
of
Parliament
and
an
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
,
 
very
prudent
and
very
diligent
,
 
of
whom
his
mother
and
sister
stand
in
great
awe
,
consult
her
frequently
and
make
no
secret
of
his
friendship
.
<EOS>
the
mother
know
her
awful
son
well
,
and
be
afraid
of
nothing
wrong
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
suffer
a
disappointment
in
love
,
but
he
have
console
himself
with
blue
-
book
,
and
master
his
passion
by
incessant
attendance
at
the
India
Board
.
<EOS>
the
lady
he
have
love
have
be
rich
,
and
Lord
Fawn
be
poor
;
but
nevertheless
he
have
master
his
passion
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
fear
that
his
feeling
towards
the
governess
would
become
too
warm
;
 
nor
be
it
likely
that
Miss
Morris
should
encounter
danger
in
regard
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
an
understand
thing
in
the
family
that
Lord
Fawn
must
marry
money
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
be
indeed
a
treasure
.
<EOS>
no
bright
face
ever
look
into
another
to
seek
sympathy
there
,
either
in
mirth
or
woe
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
gleam
in
her
eye
that
be
almost
magnetic
,
so
sure
be
she
to
obtain
by
it
that
community
of
interest
which
she
desire
,
 
though
it
be
<EOS>
but
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
pompous
,
slow
,
dull
,
and
careful
;
but
even
he
have
give
way
to
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
too
,
be
very
careful
,
but
she
have
own
to
herself
long
since
that
she
could
not
bear
to
look
forward
to
any
permanent
severance
.
<EOS>
of
course
Lucy
would
be
make
over
to
the
Hittaways
,
whose
mother
live
in
Warwick
Square
,
and
whose
father
be
Chairman
of
the
Board
of
Civil
Appeals
.
<EOS>
the
Hittaways
be
the
only
grandchild
with
whom
Lady
Fawn
have
as
yet
be
bless
,
and
of
course
Lucy
must
go
to
the
Hittaways
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
but
a
little
thing
;
 
and
it
can
not
be
say
of
her
,
as
of
Lady
Eustace
,
that
she
be
a
beauty
.
<EOS>
the
charm
of
her
face
consist
in
the
peculiar
,
watery
brightness
of
her
eye
,
 
in
the
corner
of
which
it
would
always
seem
that
a
diamond
of
a
tear
be
lurk
whenever
any
matter
of
excitement
be
afoot
.
<EOS>
Her
light
-
brown
hair
be
soft
and
smooth
and
pretty
.
<EOS>
as
hair
it
be
very
well
,
but
it
have
no
speciality
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
be
somewhat
large
,
but
full
of
ever
-
vary
expression
.
<EOS>
Her
forehead
be
low
and
broad
,
with
prominent
temple
,
on
which
it
be
her
habit
to
clasp
tightly
her
little
outstretched
finger
as
she
sit
listen
to
you
.
<EOS>
of
listener
she
be
the
very
good
,
for
she
would
always
be
say
a
word
or
two
,
just
to
help
you
,
 
the
good
word
that
could
be
speak
,
and
then
again
she
would
be
hang
on
your
lip
.
<EOS>
there
be
listener
who
show
by
their
mode
of
listen
that
they
listen
as
a
duty
,
 
not
because
they
be
interested
.
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
be
not
such
a
one
.
<EOS>
She
would
take
up
your
subject
,
whatever
it
be
,
and
make
it
her
own
.
<EOS>
there
be
forward
just
then
a
question
as
to
whether
the
Sawab
of
Mygawb
should
have
twenty
million
of
rupee
pay
to
him
and
be
place
upon
a
throne
,
or
whether
he
should
be
keep
in
prison
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
the
british
world
generally
could
not
be
make
to
interest
itself
about
the
Sawab
,
but
Lucy
positively
master
the
subject
,
and
almost
get
Lord
Fawn
into
a
difficulty
by
persuade
him
to
stand
up
against
his
chief
on
behalf
of
the
injure
prince
.
  
<EOS>
what
else
can
be
say
of
her
face
or
personal
appearance
that
will
interest
a
reader
?
<EOS>
when
she
smile
,
there
be
the
dainty
little
dimple
on
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
and
when
she
laugh
,
that
little
nose
,
which
be
not
as
well
-
shape
a
nose
as
it
may
have
be
,
would
almost
change
its
shape
and
cock
itself
up
in
its
mirth
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
be
very
thin
and
long
,
and
so
be
her
foot
,
 
by
no
mean
model
as
be
those
of
her
friend
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
,
thin
,
quick
,
graceful
creature
,
whom
it
be
impossible
that
you
should
see
without
wish
to
have
near
you
.
<EOS>
a
most
unselfish
little
creature
she
be
,
but
one
who
have
a
well
-
form
idea
of
her
own
identity
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
resolve
to
be
somebody
among
her
fellow
-
creature
,
 
not
somebody
in
the
way
of
marry
a
lord
or
a
rich
man
,
or
somebody
in
the
way
of
be
a
beauty
,
or
somebody
as
a
wit
;
but
somebody
as
have
a
purpose
and
a
use
in
life
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
humble
little
thing
in
the
world
in
regard
to
any
possible
putting
of
herself
forward
or
needful
putting
of
herself
back
;
and
yet
,
to
herself
,
nobody
be
her
superior
.
<EOS>
what
she
have
be
her
own
,
whether
it
be
the
old
grey
silk
dress
which
she
have
buy
with
the
money
she
have
earn
,
or
the
wit
which
nature
have
give
her
.
<EOS>
and
Lord
Fawn
's
title
be
his
own
,
and
Lady
Fawn
's
rank
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
covet
no
man
's
possession
,
 
and
no
woman
's
;
but
she
be
minded
to
hold
by
her
own
.
<EOS>
of
present
advantage
or
disadvantage
,
 
whether
she
have
the
one
or
suffer
from
the
other
,
 
she
think
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
fault
that
she
have
nothing
of
feminine
vanity
.
<EOS>
but
no
man
or
woman
be
ever
more
anxious
to
be
effective
,
to
persuade
,
to
obtain
belief
,
sympathy
,
and
co
-
operation
;
 
not
for
any
result
personal
to
herself
,
but
because
,
by
obtain
these
thing
,
she
could
be
effective
in
the
object
then
before
her
,
be
it
what
it
may
.
  
<EOS>
one
other
thing
may
be
tell
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
give
her
heart
,
 
for
good
and
all
,
as
she
own
to
herself
,
 
to
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
She
have
own
to
herself
that
it
be
so
,
and
have
own
to
herself
that
nothing
could
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
Frank
be
become
a
man
of
mark
,
 
but
be
become
a
man
of
mark
without
much
money
.
<EOS>
of
all
man
he
be
the
last
who
could
afford
to
marry
a
governess
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
moreover
,
he
have
never
say
a
word
to
make
her
think
that
he
love
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
call
on
her
once
or
twice
at
Fawn
Court
,
 
as
why
should
he
not
?
<EOS>
see
that
there
have
be
friendship
between
the
family
for
so
many
year
,
who
could
complain
of
that
?
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
however
,
have
 
not
complain
,
but
just
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
a
word
in
season
<EOS>
,
how
good
be
it
?
<EOS>
Lucy
do
not
much
regard
the
word
speak
to
herself
;
but
when
she
reflect
that
a
word
must
also
have
be
speak
to
Mr.
Greystock
,
 
otherwise
how
should
it
have
be
that
he
never
come
again
?
 
<EOS>
that
she
do
not
like
.
  
<EOS>
in
herself
she
regard
this
passion
of
her
as
a
healthy
man
regard
the
loss
of
a
leg
or
an
arm
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
nuisance
,
a
loss
that
maim
the
whole
life
,
 
a
misfortune
to
be
much
regretted
.
<EOS>
but
because
a
leg
be
go
,
everything
be
not
go
.
<EOS>
a
man
with
a
wooden
leg
may
stump
about
through
much
action
,
and
may
enjoy
the
keen
pleasure
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
eye
leave
to
him
,
and
his
ear
,
and
his
intellect
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
break
his
heart
for
the
loss
of
that
leg
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
She
would
still
stump
about
and
be
very
active
.
<EOS>
eye
,
ear
,
and
intellect
be
leave
to
her
.
<EOS>
look
at
her
position
,
she
tell
herself
that
a
happy
love
could
hardly
have
be
her
lot
in
life
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
she
think
,
be
right
.
<EOS>
a
governess
should
make
up
her
mind
to
do
without
a
lover
.
<EOS>
She
have
give
away
her
heart
,
and
yet
she
would
do
without
a
lover
.
<EOS>
when
,
on
one
dull
,
dark
afternoon
,
as
she
be
think
of
all
this
,
Lord
Fawn
suddenly
put
into
her
hand
a
cruelly
long
print
document
respect
the
Sawab
,
she
go
to
work
upon
it
immediately
.
<EOS>
as
she
read
it
,
she
could
not
refrain
from
think
how
wonderfully
Frank
Greystock
would
plead
the
cause
of
the
indian
prince
,
if
the
privilege
of
plead
it
could
be
give
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
spring
have
come
round
,
with
May
and
the
London
butterfly
,
at
the
time
at
which
our
story
begin
,
and
during
six
month
Frank
Greystock
have
not
be
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
then
one
day
Lady
Eustace
come
down
with
her
pony
,
and
her
footman
,
and
a
new
dear
friend
of
hers
,
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
while
Miss
Macnulty
be
be
honour
by
Lady
Fawn
,
Lizzie
have
retreat
to
a
corner
with
her
old
dear
friend
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
to
see
how
so
wealthy
and
fashionable
a
woman
as
Lady
Eustace
could
show
so
much
friendship
to
a
governess
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
see
Frank
,
lately
?
"
say
Lady
Eustace
,
refer
to
her
cousin
the
barrister
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
for
ever
so
long
,
"
say
Lucy
,
with
her
cheery
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
go
to
prove
a
false
knight
?
"
ask
Lady
Eustace
,
in
her
low
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
Mr.
Greystock
be
much
give
to
knighthood
at
all
,
"
say
Lucy
,
 
"
unless
it
be
to
be
make
Sir
Francis
by
his
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nonsense
,
my
dear
;
as
if
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Lady
Fawn
have
be
interfere
 
like
an
old
cat
as
she
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
an
old
cat
,
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
and
I
will
not
hear
her
call
so
.
<EOS>
if
you
think
so
,
you
should
not
come
here
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
not
interfere
.
<EOS>
that
is
,
she
have
do
nothing
that
she
ought
not
to
have
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
she
have
interfere
,
"
say
Lady
Eustace
,
as
she
get
up
and
walk
across
the
room
,
with
a
sweet
smile
to
the
old
cat
.
   
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
 
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
<EOS>
the
barrister
be
the
only
son
of
the
Dean
of
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
now
the
dean
have
a
family
of
daughter
,
 
not
quite
so
numerous
indeed
as
that
of
Lady
Fawn
,
for
there
be
only
three
of
them
,
 
and
be
by
no
mean
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
unless
a
dean
have
a
private
fortune
,
or
have
chance
to
draw
the
happy
lot
of
Durham
in
the
lottery
of
deans
,
he
can
hardly
be
wealthy
.
<EOS>
at
Bobsborough
the
dean
be
endow
with
a
large
,
rambling
,
picturesque
,
uncomfortable
house
,
and
with
£
1,500
a
year
.
<EOS>
in
regard
to
personal
property
it
may
be
assert
of
all
the
Greystocks
that
they
never
have
any
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
family
of
which
the
male
would
surely
come
to
be
dean
and
admiral
,
and
the
female
would
certainly
find
husband
.
<EOS>
and
they
live
on
the
good
thing
of
the
world
,
and
mix
with
wealthy
people
.
<EOS>
but
they
never
have
any
money
.
<EOS>
the
Eustaces
always
have
money
,
and
the
Bishop
of
Bobsborough
be
wealthy
.
<EOS>
the
dean
be
a
man
very
different
from
his
brother
the
admiral
,
who
have
never
pay
anybody
anything
.
<EOS>
the
dean
do
pay
;
but
he
be
a
little
slow
in
his
payment
,
and
money
with
him
be
never
very
plentiful
.
<EOS>
in
these
circumstance
it
become
very
expedient
that
Frank
Greystock
should
earn
his
bread
early
in
life
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
have
choose
a
profession
which
be
not
often
lucrative
at
first
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
call
to
the
Bar
,
and
have
go
,
 
and
be
still
go
,
 
the
circuit
in
which
lie
the
cathedral
city
of
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
bobsborough
be
not
much
of
a
town
,
and
be
honour
with
the
judge
'
visit
only
every
other
circuit
.
<EOS>
Frank
begin
pretty
well
,
get
some
little
work
in
London
,
and
perhaps
nearly
enough
to
pay
the
cost
of
his
circuit
out
of
the
county
in
which
the
cathedral
be
situate
.
<EOS>
but
he
begin
life
after
that
impecunious
fashion
for
which
the
Greystocks
have
be
note
.
<EOS>
tailor
,
robemaker
,
and
bookseller
give
him
trust
,
and
do
believe
that
they
would
get
their
money
.
<EOS>
and
any
persistent
tradesman
do
get
it
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
actually
hoist
the
black
flag
of
impecuniosity
,
and
proclaim
his
intention
of
prey
generally
upon
the
retail
dealer
,
as
his
uncle
the
admiral
have
do
.
<EOS>
but
he
become
know
as
a
young
man
with
whom
money
be
"
tight
.
<EOS>
"
all
this
have
be
go
on
for
three
or
four
year
before
he
have
meet
Lucy
Morris
at
the
deanery

<EOS>
He
be
then
eight
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
have
be
four
year
call
.
<EOS>
He
be
thirty
when
old
Lady
Fawn
hint
to
him
that
he
have
well
not
pay
any
more
visit
at
Fawn
Court
.
  
<EOS>
but
thing
have
much
alter
with
him
of
late
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
of
that
visit
to
the
deanery
he
have
make
a
sudden
start
in
his
profession
.
<EOS>
the
Corporation
of
the
City
of
London
have
bring
an
action
against
the
Bank
of
England
with
reference
to
certain
allege
encroachment
,
of
which
action
,
considerable
as
it
be
in
all
its
interest
,
no
further
notice
nee
be
take
here
than
be
give
by
the
statement
that
a
great
deal
of
money
in
this
cause
have
find
its
way
among
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
some
of
it
penetrate
into
the
pocket
of
Frank
Greystock
;
but
he
earn
more
than
money
,
well
than
money
,
out
of
that
affair
.
<EOS>
It
be
attribute
to
him
by
the
attorney
that
the
Bank
of
England
be
save
from
the
necessity
of
reconstruct
all
its
bullion
-
cellar
,
and
he
have
make
his
character
for
industry
.
<EOS>
in
the
year
after
that
the
bobsborough
people
be
rather
drive
into
a
corner
in
search
of
a
clever
young
conservative
candidate
for
the
borough
,
and
Frank
Greystock
be
invite
to
stand
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
think
that
there
be
much
chance
of
success
,
and
the
dean
be
against
it
.
<EOS>
but
Frank
like
the
honour
and
glory
of
the
contest
,
and
so
do
Frank
's
mother
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
stand
,
and
at
the
time
in
which
he
be
warn
away
from
Fawn
Court
have
be
nearly
a
year
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
do
interfere
with
one
's
business
,
"
he
have
say
to
his
father
,
"
but
then
it
bring
one
business
also
.
<EOS>
a
man
with
a
seat
in
Parliament
who
show
that
he
mean
work
will
always
get
nearly
as
much
work
as
he
can
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
be
Frank
's
exposition
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
not
be
find
to
hold
water
in
all
case
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dean
be
of
course
delighted
with
her
son
's
success
,
and
so
be
the
girl
.
<EOS>
woman
like
to
feel
that
the
young
man
belong
to
them
be
do
something
in
the
world
,
so
that
a
reflect
glory
may
be
theirs
.
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
talk
of
Frank
as
member
for
the
city
.
<EOS>
brother
do
not
always
care
much
for
a
brother
's
success
,
but
a
sister
be
generally
sympathetic
.
<EOS>
if
Frank
would
only
marry
money
,
there
be
nothing
he
may
not
achieve
.
<EOS>
that
he
would
live
to
sit
on
the
woolsack
<EOS>
be
now
almost
a
certainty
to
the
dear
old
lady
.
<EOS>
but
in
order
that
he
may
sit
there
comfortably
it
be
necessary
that
he
should
at
least
abstain
from
marry
a
poor
wife
.
<EOS>
for
there
be
fear
at
the
deanery
also
in
regard
to
Lucy
Morris
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
notion
of
marry
money
as
you
call
it
,
"
Frank
say
to
his
second
sister
Margaret
,
"
be
the
most
disgusting
idea
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
easy
to
love
a
girl
who
have
something
as
one
who
have
nothing
,
"
say
Margaret
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
 
it
be
not
;
because
the
girl
with
money
be
scarce
,
and
those
without
it
be
plentiful
,
 
an
argument
of
which
I
do
not
suppose
you
see
the
force
.
<EOS>
"
then
Margaret
for
the
moment
be
snub
and
retire
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Frank
,
I
think
Lady
Fawn
be
right
,
"
say
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
she
be
quite
wrong
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
anything
in
it
,
it
will
not
be
expel
by
Lady
Fawn
's
interference
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
should
allow
Lady
Fawn
to
tell
me
not
to
choose
such
or
such
a
woman
for
my
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
habit
of
see
her
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
nobody
love
Lucy
Morris
better
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
We
all
like
her
.
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Frank
,
would
it
do
for
you
to
make
her
your
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
be
silent
for
a
moment
,
and
then
he
answer
his
mother
's
question
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
quite
sure
whether
it
would
or
would
not
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
think
this
 
<EOS>
that
if
I
be
bold
enough
to
marry
now
,
and
to
trust
all
to
the
future
,
and
could
get
Lucy
to
be
my
wife
,
I
should
be
do
a
great
thing
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
however
,
whether
I
have
the
courage
.
<EOS>
"
all
of
which
make
the
dean
's
wife
uneasy
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
,
who
have
read
so
far
,
will
perhaps
think
that
Frank
Greystock
be
in
love
with
Lucy
as
Lucy
be
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
but
such
be
not
exactly
the
case
.
<EOS>
to
be
in
love
,
as
an
absolute
,
well
-
mark
,
acknowledge
fact
,
be
the
condition
of
a
woman
more
frequently
and
more
readily
than
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
such
be
not
the
common
theory
on
the
matter
,
as
it
be
the
man
's
business
to
speak
,
and
the
woman
's
business
to
be
reticent
.
<EOS>
and
the
woman
be
presume
to
have
keep
her
heart
free
from
any
load
of
love
,
till
she
may
accept
the
burthen
with
an
assurance
that
it
shall
become
a
joy
and
a
comfort
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
such
presumption
,
though
they
may
be
very
useful
for
the
regulation
of
conduct
,
may
not
be
always
true
.
<EOS>
It
come
more
within
the
scope
of
a
woman
's
mind
,
than
that
of
a
man
's
,
to
think
closely
and
decide
sharply
on
such
a
matter
.
<EOS>
with
a
man
it
be
often
chance
that
settle
the
question
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
to
propose
to
a
woman
,
or
propose
without
resolve
,
because
she
be
close
to
him
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
ridicule
the
idea
of
Lady
Fawn
's
interference
in
so
high
a
matter
as
his
love
,
 
or
abstinence
from
love
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
have
he
be
make
a
welcome
guest
at
Fawn
Court
,
he
would
undoubtedly
have
tell
his
love
to
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
welcome
guest
,
but
have
be
banish
;
and
,
as
a
consequence
of
that
banishment
,
he
have
form
no
resolution
in
regard
to
Lucy
,
and
do
not
absolutely
know
whether
she
be
necessary
to
him
or
not
.
<EOS>
but
Lucy
Morris
know
all
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
moreover
,
it
frequently
happen
with
man
that
they
fail
to
analyse
these
thing
,
and
do
not
make
out
for
themselves
any
clear
definition
of
what
their
feeling
be
or
what
they
mean
.
<EOS>
We
hear
that
a
man
have
behave
badly
to
a
girl
,
when
the
behaviour
of
which
he
have
be
guilty
have
result
simply
from
want
of
thought
.
<EOS>
He
have
find
a
certain
companionship
to
be
agreeable
to
him
,
and
he
have
accept
the
pleasure
without
inquiry
.
<EOS>
some
vague
idea
have
float
across
his
brain
that
the
world
be
wrong
in
supposing
that
such
friendship
can
not
exist
without
marriage
,
or
question
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
be
simply
friendship
.
<EOS>
and
yet
be
his
friend
to
tell
him
that
she
intend
to
give
herself
in
marriage
elsewhere
,
he
would
suffer
all
the
pang
of
jealousy
,
and
would
imagine
himself
to
be
horribly
ill
-
treat
!
<EOS>
to
have
such
a
friend
,
 
a
friend
whom
he
can
not
or
will
not
make
his
wife
,
 
be
no
injury
to
him
.
<EOS>
to
him
it
be
simply
a
delight
,
an
excitement
in
life
,
a
thing
to
be
know
to
himself
only
and
not
talk
of
to
other
,
a
source
of
pride
and
inward
exultation
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
joy
to
think
of
when
he
wake
,
and
a
consolation
in
his
little
trouble
.
<EOS>
It
dispel
the
weariness
of
life
,
and
make
a
green
spot
of
holiday
within
his
daily
work
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
death
to
her
;
 
but
he
do
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
do
think
that
he
could
not
marry
Lucy
Morris
without
make
an
imprudent
plunge
into
deep
water
,
and
yet
he
feel
that
Lady
Fawn
be
an
ill
-
natured
old
woman
for
hint
to
him
that
he
have
well
not
,
for
the
present
,
continue
his
visit
to
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
understand
me
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
"
she
have
say
,
mean
to
be
civil

"
<EOS>
when
Miss

I
should

you

"
what
on

would
take
me
to
Fawn
Court

if
Lucy

not
there

<EOS>
he
say
to
himself
,
 
not
choose
to
appreciate
Lady
Fawn
's
civility
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
be
at
this
time
nearly
thirty
year
old
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
-
look
,
but
not
strikingly
handsome
man
;
thin
,
of
moderate
height
,
with
sharp
grey
eye
,
a
face
clean
shorn
with
the
exception
of
a
small
whisker
,
with
wiry
,
strong
dark
hair
,
which
be
already
begin
to
show
a
tinge
of
grey
;
 
the
very
opposite
in
appearance
to
his
late
friend
Sir
Florian
Eustace
.
<EOS>
He
be
quick
,
ready
-
witted
,
self
-
reliant
,
and
not
over
scrupulous
in
the
outward
thing
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
be
desirous
of
do
his
duty
to
other
,
but
he
be
specially
desirous
that
other
should
do
their
duty
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
intend
to
get
on
in
the
world
,
and
believe
that
happiness
be
to
be
achieve
by
success
.
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
make
for
the
profession
which
he
have
adopt
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
look
to
certain
morsel
of
Church
patronage
which
occasionally
come
in
his
way
,
and
to
the
fact
that
he
and
the
bishop
be
on
most
friendly
term
,
have
wish
his
son
to
take
order
.
<EOS>
but
Frank
have
know
himself
and
his
own
quality
too
well
to
follow
his
father
's
advice
.
<EOS>
He
have
choose
to
be
a
barrister
,
and
now
,
at
thirty
,
he
be
in
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
ask
to
stand
for
Bobsborough
in
the
conservative
interest
,
and
as
a
Conservative
he
have
be
return
.
<EOS>
those
who
invite
him
know
probably
but
little
of
his
own
political
belief
or
feeling
,
 
do
not
,
probably
,
know
whether
he
have
any
.
<EOS>
His
father
be
a
fine
old
Tory
of
the
ancient
school
,
who
think
that
thing
be
go
from
bad
to
bad
,
but
be
able
to
live
happily
in
spite
of
his
anticipation
.
<EOS>
the
dean
be
one
of
those
old
-
world
politician
,
 
we
meet
them
every
day
,
and
they
be
generally
pleasant
people
,
 
who
enjoy
the
politic
of
the
side
to
which
they
belong
without
any
special
belief
in
them
.
<EOS>
if
press
hard
they
will
almost
own
that
their
so

call
conviction
be
prejudice
.
<EOS>
but
not
for
world
would
they
be
rid
of
them
.
<EOS>
when
two
or
three
of
them
meet
together
,
they
be
as
freemason
,
who
be
bind
by
a
pleasant
bond
which
separate
them
from

outer

<EOS>
They
feel
among
themselves
that
everything
that
be
be
do
be
bad
,
 
even
though
that
everything
be
do
by
their
own
party

<EOS>
It
be
bad
to
interfere
with
Charles
,
bad
to
endure
Cromwell
,
bad
to
banish
James
,
bad
to
put
up
with
William

<EOS>
the
House
of
Hanover
be
bad

<EOS>
all
interference

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
abolition

bad

<EOS>
the
meddling
with
the
Universities

be
grievous

<EOS>
the
treatment
of
the
Irish

be
Satanic

the

be
most
injurious

<EOS>
education
bill
and

<EOS>
every

<EOS>
and
yet
to
them
old
England
be
of
all
country
in

the
good
to
live
in
,
and
be
not
at
all
the
less
comfortable
because
of
the
change
that
have

<EOS>
these
people
be
ready
to
grumble
at
every
boon
confer
on
them
,
and
yet
to
enjoy
every
boon
.
<EOS>
They
know
,
too
,
their
privilege

and
,
after
a
fashion

understand
their
position

<EOS>
It
be
picturesque

it

them

<EOS>
to
have

always
in

lose
side

always
be
ruin

always
under
persecution
from
a
wild
spirit
of
republican

demagogism
,
 
and
yet
never
to
lose
anything
,
not
even
position

public
esteem
,
be
pleasant
enough
.
<EOS>
a
huge

living

daily

grievance
that
do

no
palpable
harm

be
the
happy
possession
that
a

<EOS>
there
be
a
large
body
of
such
man
in
England
,
and
,
personally
,
they
be
the
very
salt
of
the
nation
.
<EOS>
He
who
say
that
all
Conservatives
be
stupid
do
not
know
them

<EOS>
stupid
Conservatives
there
may
be

there
certainly
be
very
stupid
radical

<EOS>
the

who

generally
the
pleasantest

<EOS>
but
he
be
a
Buddhist
,
possess
a
religious
creed
which
be
altogether
dark
and
mysterious
to
the
outer

.
<EOS>
those
who
watch
the
way
of
the
advanced
Buddhist
hardly
know
whether
the
man
do
believe
himself
in
his
hide
god

but
man
perceive
that
he
be
respectable

self

satisfied

a

of
note

<EOS>
It
be
of
course
from
the
society
of
such
that
conservative
candidate
be
to
be
seek

but
,
alas

it
be
hard
to
indoctrinate
young
mind
with
the
old
belief

since
new
theory
of

have
become
so
rife

<EOS>
nevertheless
Frank

,
when

invite
to
stand
for
Bobsborough
in
the
conservative
interest
,
have
not
for
a
moment
allow
any
political
heterodoxy
on
his
own
part
to
stand
in
the
way
of
his
advancement
.
<EOS>
It
may
,
perhaps
,
be
the
case
that
a
barrister
be
less
likely
to
be
influence
by
personal
conviction
in
take
his
side
in
politic
than
any
other
man
who
devote
himself
to
public
affair
.
<EOS>
no
slur
on
the
profession
be
intend
by
this
suggestion
.
<EOS>
a
busy
,
clever
,
useful
man
,
who
have
be
at
work
all
his
life
,
find
that
his
own
progress
towards
success
demand
from
him
that
he
shall
become
a
politician
.
<EOS>
the
high
work
of
a
lawyer
can
only
be
reach
through
political
struggle
.
<EOS>
as
a
large
-
minded
man
of
the
world
,
peculiarly
conversant
with
the
fact
that
every
question
have
two
side
,
and
that
as
much
may
often
be
say
on
one
side
as
on
the
other
,
he
have
probably
not
become
violent
in
his
feeling
as
a
political
partisan
.
<EOS>
thus
he
see
that
there
be
an
opening
here
or
an
opening
there
,
and
the
offence
in
either
case
be
not
great
to
him
.
<EOS>
with
Frank
Greystock
the
matter
be
very
easy
.
<EOS>
there
certainly
be
no
apostasy
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
and
again
attack
his
father
's
ultra
-
Toryism
,
and
rebuke
his
mother
and
sister
when
they
speak
of
Gladstone
as
Apollyon
,
and
call
John
Bright
the
Abomination
of
Desolation
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
easy
to
him
to
fancy
himself
a
Conservative
,
and
as
such
he
take
his
seat
in
the
House
without
any
feeling
of
discomfort
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
first
four
month
of
his
first
session
he
have
not
speak
,
 
but
he
have
make
himself
useful
.
<EOS>
He
have
sit
on
one
or
two
committee
,
though
as
a
barrister
he
may
have
excuse
himself
,
and
have
do
his
good
to
learn
the
form
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
already
begin
to
find
that
the
time
which
he
devote
to
Parliament
be
much
want
for
his
profession
.
<EOS>
money
be
very
necessary
to
him
.
<EOS>
then
a
new
idea
be
present
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
John
Eustace
and
Greystock
be
very
intimate
,
 
as
also
have
be
Sir
Florian
and
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
I
wish
you
would
do
,
Greystock
,
"
Eustace
say
to
him
one
day
,
as
they
be
stand
idly
together
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
for
John
Eustace
be
also
in
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
"
anything
to
oblige
you
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
a
trifle
,
"
say
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
just
to
marry
your
cousin
,
my
brother
's
widow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
Jove
,
 
I
wish
I
have
the
chance

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
why
you
should
not
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
to
marry
somebody
,
and
at
her
age
so
she
ought
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
twenty
-
three
yet
.
<EOS>
We
could
trust
you
,
 
with
the
child
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
be
give
us
a
deal
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
dear
fellow
 
"
  
"
I
know
she
be
fond
of
you

<EOS>
You

there
last
Sunday

and
so
be
Fawn

<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
the
man
to
marry
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
You
see
if
he
do
not
.
<EOS>
He
be
uncommonly
sweet
on
her
the
other
night
,
and
really
interest
her
about
the
Sawab
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
never
be
Lady
Fawn
,
"
say
John
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
and
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
should
not
care
to
have
to
deal
with
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
infinitely
troublesome
;
and
I
can
hardly
wash
my
hand
of
her
affair
.
<EOS>
She
be
worth
nearly
£
5,000
a
year
as
long
as
she
live
,
and
I
really
do
not
think
that
she
be
much
amiss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
much
amiss
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
she
be
not
the
pretty
woman
I
ever
see
,
"
say
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
but
I
mean
in
conduct
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
She
be
make
herself
queer
;
and
Camperdown
,
our
lawyer
,
mean
to
jump
upon
her
;
but
it
be
only
because
she
do
not
know
what
she
ought
to
be
at
,
and
what
she
ought
not
.
<EOS>
You
could
tell
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
suit
me
at
all
to
have
to
quarrel
with
Camperdown
,
"
say
the
barrister
,
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
and
he
would
settle
everything
in
five
minute
,
and
it
would
save
me
a
world
of
trouble

say
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fawn
be
your

when

have
a
delightful

who

<EOS>
in
such

as
this

any

of

kind
would
be
unusual
,

therefore
the
poor
narrator
have
be
drive
to
expend
his
first
four
chapter
in
the
mere
task
of
introduce
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
regret
the
length
of
these
introduction

will
now
begin
at
once
the
action
of
his
story
.
   
<EOS>
the
Eustace
Necklace
 
<EOS>
John
Eustace
,
Lady
Eustace
's
brother
-
in
-
law
,
have
tell
his
friend
Greystock
,
the
lady
's
cousin
,
that
Mr.
Camperdown
the
lawyer
intend
to
"
jump
upon
"
that
lady
.
<EOS>
make
such
allowance
and
deduction
from
the
force
of
these
word
as
the
slang
expression
require
,
we
may
say
that
John
Eustace
be
right
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
be
in
earnest
,
and
do
intend
to
obtain
the
restoration
of
those
jewel
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
be
a
gentleman
of
about
sixty
,
who
have
be
lawyer
to
Sir
Florian
's
father
,
and
whose
father
have
be
lawyer
to
Sir
Florian
's
grandfather
.
<EOS>
His
connexion
with
the
property
and
with
the
family
be
of
a
nature
to
allow
him
to
take
almost
any
liberty
with
the
Eustaces
.
<EOS>
when
therefore
John
Eustace
,
in
regard
to
those
diamond
,
have
plead
that
the
heir
in
his
long
minority
would
obtain
ample
mean
of
buy
more
diamond
,
and
of
suggest
that
the
plunder
for
the
sake
of
tranquillity
should
be
allow
,
Mr.
Camperdown
take
upon
himself
to
say
that
he
would
"
be
 
---
if
he
would
put
up
with
it
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
not
know
what
you
be
to
do
,
"
say
John
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
file
a
bill
in
Chancery
if
it
be
necessary
,
"
say
the
old
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heaven
on
earth
!
<EOS>
as
trustee
how
be
you
to
reconcile
yourself
to
such
a
robbery
?
<EOS>
They
represent
£
500
a
year
for
ever
,
and
she
be
to
have
them
simply
because
she
choose
to
take
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Florian
could
have
give
them
away
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
he
could
have
sell
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
look
as
yet
,
but
I
think
that
this
necklace
have
be
make
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
it
represent
an
amount
of
property
that
should
not
and
could
not
be
make
over
legally
without
some
visible
evidence
of
transfer
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
clear
a
case
of
steal
as
I
ever
know
in
my
life
,
and
as
bad
a
case
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
a
farthing
,
and
she
have
get
the
whole
of
the
Ayrshire
property
for
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
go
about
and
tell
everybody
that
it
be
her
to
sell
to
-
morrow
if
she
please
to
sell
it
!
<EOS>
no

"
Mr.

have
know

have
not

call

must
not
allow

do
you
think
of

apply
to
me
for
an
income
to
support
her
child
,
 
a
baby
not
yet
two
year
old
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
have
be
very
adverse
to
all
the
circumstance
of
Sir
Florian
's
marriage
,
and
have
subject
himself
to
Sir
Florian
's
displeasure
for
express
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
have
try
to
explain
that
as
the
lady
bring
no
money
into
the
family
she
be
not
entitle
to
such
a
jointure
as
Sir
Florian
be
determined
to
lavish
upon
her
.
<EOS>
but
Sir
Florian
have
be
obstinate
,
 
both
in
regard
to
the
settlement
and
the
will
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
after
Sir
Florian
's
death
that
this
terrible
matter
of
the
jewel
have
even
suggest
itself
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
the
jeweller
in
whose
custody
the
thing
have
be
since
the
death
of
the
late
Lady
Eustace
have
mention
the
affair
to
him
immediately
on
the
young
widow
's
return
from
Naples
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
have
withdraw
,
not
all
the
jewel
,
but
by
far
the
most
valuable
of
them
,
from
the
jeweller
"
care
on
his
return
to
London
from
their
marriage
tour
to
Scotland
,
and
this
be
the
result
.
<EOS>
the
jeweller
be
at
that
time
without
any
doubt
as
to
the
date
at
which
the
necklace
be
take
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
's
first
attempt
be
make
by
a
most
courteous
and
even
complimentary
note
,
in
which
he
suggest
to
Lady
Eustace
that
it
would
be
for
the
advantage
of
all
party

that
she
do
not
exactly

such
an
arrangement

<EOS>
She

they

an
amount
of

from

without
inquiry

we

<EOS>
We

Madam

Your

CAMPERDOWN

<EOS>
a
few
day
after
it
be
send
old
Mr.
Camperdown
get
the
letter
-
book
of
the
office
and
read
the
letter
to
John
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
how
you
be
to
get
them
,
"
say
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
throw
upon
her
the
burthen
of
show
that
they
have
become
legally
her
property
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
she
sell
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
follow
them
up
.
<EOS>
£
10,000
,
my
dear
John
!
<EOS>
God
bless
my
soul
!
<EOS>
it
be
a
magnificent
dowry
for
a
daughter
,
 
an
ample
provision
for
a
young
son
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
to
be
allow
to
filch
it
,
as
other
widow
filch
china
cups
,
and
a
silver
teaspoon
or
two
!
<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
common
thing
,
but
I
never
hear
of
such
a
haul
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
very
unpleasant
,
"
say
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
she
still
go
about
everywhere
declare
that
the
Portray
property
be
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
bad
lot
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
of
course
we
shall
have
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Eustace
explain
to
the
lawyer
that
their
good
way
out
of
it
all
would
be
to
get
the
widow
married
to
some
respectable
husband
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
to
marry
sooner
or
later
,
 
so
John
Eustace
say
,
 
and
any
"
decently
decent
"
fellow
would
be
easy
to
deal
with
than
she
herself
.
"
<EOS>
He
must
be
very
indecently
indecent
if
he
be
not
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Eustace
do
not
name
Frank
Greystock
the
barrister
as
the
probable
future
decent
husband
.
  
<EOS>
when
Lizzie
first
get
the
letter
,
which
she
do
on
the
day
after
the
visit
at
Fawn
Court
of
which
mention
have
be
make
,
she
put
it
by
unread
for
a
couple
of
day
.
<EOS>
She
open
it
,
not
know
the
clerk
's
handwriting
,
but
read
only
the
first
line
and
the
signature
.
<EOS>
for
two
day
she
go
on
with
the
ordinary
affair
and
amusement
of
her
life
,
as
though
no
such
letter
have
reach
her
;
but
she
be
think
of
it
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
the
diamond
be
in
her
possession
,
and
she
have
have
them
value
by
her
old
friend
Mr.
Benjamin
 
of
the
firm
of
Harter
and
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
have
suggest
that
stone
of
such
a
value
should
not
be
leave
to
the
risk
of
an
ordinary
London
house
;
but
Lizzie
have
feel
that
if
Mr.
Benjamin
get
them
into
his
hand
,
Mr.
Benjamin
may
perhaps
not
return
them
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Camperdown
and
Garnett
between
them
may
form
a
league
with
Mr.
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
where
would
she
be
,
should
Mr.
Benjamin
tell
her
that
under
some
legal
sanction
he
have
give
the
jewel
up
to
Mr.
Camperdown
?
<EOS>
She
hint
to
Mr.
Benjamin
that
she
would
perhaps
sell
them
if
she
get
a
good
offer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
,
who
be
very
familiar
with
her
,
hint
that
there
may
be
a
little
family
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
none
in
the
least
,
"
say
Lizzie
;
 
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
think
I
shall
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
give
Mr.
Benjamin
an
order
for
a
strong
box
,
which
be
supply
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
strong
box
,
which
be
so
heavy
that
she
could
barely
lift
it
herself
,
be
now
in
her
London
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
she
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
be
stay
with
her
,
but
she
have
not
say
a
word
to
Miss
Macnulty
about
the
letter
.
<EOS>
She
read
it
up
in
her
own
bedroom
,
and
then
sit
down
to
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
,
as
he
have
hand
to
her
the
stone
for
the
purpose
of
a
special
dinner
party
which
have
be
give
to
them
when
pass
through
London
,
have
tell
her
that
they
be
family
jewel
.
<EOS>
"
that
setting
be
do
for
my
mother
,
"
he
say
,
"
but
it
be
already
old
.
<EOS>
when
we
be
at
home
again
they
shall
be
reset
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
have
add
some
little
husband
's
joke
as
to
a
future
daughter
-
in
-
law
who
should
wear
them
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
she
be
not
sure
whether
the
fact
of
their
be
so
handed
to
her
do
not
make
them
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
have
speak
a
second
time
to
Mr.
Mopus
,
and
Mr.
Mopus
have
ask
her
whether
there
exist
any
family
dee
as
to
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
of
no
such
deed
,
nor
do
Mr.
Camperdown
mention
such
a
deed
.
<EOS>
after
read
the
letter
once
she
read
it
a
dozen
time
;
and
then
,
like
a
woman
,
make
up
her
mind
that
her
safe
course
would
be
not
to
answer
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
yet
she
feel
sure
that
something
unpleasant
would
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
be
not
a
man
to
take
up
such
a
question
and
to
let
it
drop
.
<EOS>
legal
step
!
<EOS>
what
do
legal
step
mean
,
and
what
could
they
do
to
her
?
<EOS>
Would
Mr.
Camperdown
be
able
to
put
her
in
prison
,
 
or
to
take
away
from
her
the
estate
of
Portray
?
<EOS>
She
could
swear
that
her
husband
have
give
them
to
her
,
and
could
invent
any
form
of
word
she
please
as
accompany
the
gift
.
<EOS>
no
one
else
have
be
near
them
then
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
,
and
feel
herself
to
be
absolutely
,
alarmingly
ignorant
,
not
only
of
the
law
,
but
of
custom
in
such
matter
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Mowbray
and
Mopus
and
Mr.
Benjamin
be
the
ally
to
whom
she
look
for
guidance
;
but
she
be
wise
enough
to
know
that
Mowbray
and
Mopus
,
and
Harter
and
Benjamin
be
not
trustworthy
,
whereas
Camperdown
and
Son
and
the
Messrs.
Garnett
be
all
as
firm
as
rock
and
as
respectable
as
the
Bank
of
England
.
<EOS>
circumstance
,
 
unfortunate
circumstance
,
 
drive
her
to
Harter
and
Benjamin
and
to
Mowbray
and
Mopus
,
while
she
would
have
take
so
much
delight
in
feel
the
strong
honesty
of
the
other
people
to
be
on
her
side
!
<EOS>
She
would
have
talk
to
her
friend
about
Mr.
Camperdown
and
the
people
at
Garnett
's
with
so
much
satisfaction
!
<EOS>
but
ease
,
security
,
and
even
respectability
may
be
buy
too
dearly
.
<EOS>
ten
thousand
pound
!
<EOS>
be
she
prepare
to
surrender
such
a
sum
as
that
?
<EOS>
She
have
,
indeed
,
already
realise
the
fact
that
it
may
be
very
difficult
to
touch
the
money
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
suggest
to
Mr.
Benjamin
that
he
should
buy
the
jewel
,
that
worthy
tradesman
have
by
no
mean
jump
at
the
offer
.
<EOS>
of
what
use
to
her
would
be
a
necklace
always
lock
up
in
an
iron
box
,
which
box
,
for
aught
she
know
,
myrmidon
from
Mr.
Camperdown
may
carry
off
during
her
absence
from
the
house
?
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
well
to
come
to
term
and
surrender
?
<EOS>
but
then
what
should
the
term
be
?
  
<EOS>
if
only
there
have
be
a
friend
whom
she
could
consult
;
a
friend
whom
she
could
consult
on
a
really
friendly
footing
!
 
<EOS>
not
a
simply
respectable
,
off
-
handed
,
high
-
minded
friend
,
who
would
advise
her
as
a
matter
of
course
to
make
restitution
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
the
dean
,
or
her
cousin
Frank
,
or
old
Lady
Fawn
,
would
be
sure
to
give
her
such
advice
as
that
.
<EOS>
there
be
people
who
be
so
very
high
-
minded
when
they
have
to
deal
with
the
interest
of
their
friend
!
<EOS>
what
if
she
be
to
ask
Lord
Fawn
?
  
<EOS>
thought
of
a
second
marriage
have
,
of
course
,
cross
Lady
Eustace
's
mind
,
and
they
be
by
no
means
the
bad
thought
that
find
a
place
there
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
grand
idea
,
 
this
selfish
,
hard
-
fisted
little
woman
,
who
could
not
bring
herself
to
abandon
the
plunder
on
which
she
have
lay
her
hand
,
 
a
grand
idea
of
surrender
herself
and
all
her
possession
to
a
great
passion
.
<EOS>
for
Florian
Eustace
she
have
never
care
.
<EOS>
She
have
sit
down
by
his
side
,
and
look
into
his
handsome
face
,
and
read
poetry
to
him
,
 
because
of
his
wealth
,
and
because
it
have
be
indispensable
to
her
to
settle
herself
well
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
be
all
very
well
,
 
a
generous
,
open
-
hearted
,
chivalrous
,
irascible
,
but
rather
heavy
-
minded
gentleman
;
but
she
have
never
be
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
now
she
desire
to
be
so
in
love
that
she
could
surrender
everything
to
her
love
.
<EOS>
there
be
as
yet
nothing
of
such
love
in
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
no
one
who
have
so
touch
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
alive
to
the
romance
of
the
thing
,
and
be
in
love
with
the
idea
of
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
"
she
would
say
to
herself
in
her
moment
of
solitude
,
"
if
I
have
a
Corsair
of
my
own
,
how
I
would
sit
on
watch
for
my
lover
's
boat
by
the
sea
-
shore
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
believe
it
of
herself
,
that
she
could
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
would
also
be
very
nice
to
be
a
peeress
,
 
so
that
she
may
,
without
any
doubt
,
be
one
of
the
great
lady
of
London
.
<EOS>
as
a
baronet
's
widow
with
a
large
income
,
she
be
already
almost
a
great
lady
;
but
she
be
quite
alive
to
a
suspicion
that
she
be
not
altogether
strong
in
her
position
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
's
people
and
the
dean
's
people
do
not
quite
trust
her
.
<EOS>
the
Camperdowns
and
Garnetts
utterly
distrust
her
.
<EOS>
the
Mopuses
and
Benjamins
be
more
familiar
than
they
would
be
with
a
really
great
lady
.
<EOS>
She
be
sharp
enough
to
understand
all
this
.
<EOS>
Should
it
be
Lord
Fawn
or
should
it
be
a
Corsair
?
<EOS>
the
bad
of
Lord
Fawn
be
the
undoubted
fact
that
he
be
not
himself
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
no
doubt
,
make
his
wife
a
peeress
;
but
he
be
poor
,
encumber
with
a
host
of
sister
,
dull
as
a
blue
-
book
,
and
possess
of
little
beyond
his
peerage
to
recommend
him
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
only
find
a
peer
,
unmarrie
,
with
a
dash
of
the
Corsair
about
him
!
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
what
be
she
to
do
about
the
jewel
?
  
<EOS>
there
be
stay
with
her
at
this
time
a
certain
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
be
relate
,
after
some
distant
fashion
,
to
old
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
who
be
as
utterly
destitute
of
possession
or
mean
of
existence
as
any
unfortunate
,
well
-
bear
,
and
moderately
-
educate
,
middle
-
aged
woman
in
London
.
<EOS>
to
live
upon
her
friend
,
such
as
they
may
be
,
be
the
only
mode
of
life
within
her
reach
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
she
have
choose
such
dependence
;
nor
,
indeed
,
have
she
endeavour
to
reject
it
.
<EOS>
It
have
come
to
her
as
a
matter
of
course
,
 
either
that
or
the
poor
-
house
.
<EOS>
as
to
earn
her
bread
,
except
by
that
attendance
which
a
poor
friend
give
,
 
the
idea
of
any
possibility
that
way
have
never
enter
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
could
do
nothing
,
 
except
dress
like
a
lady
with
the
small
possible
cost
,
and
endeavour
to
be
oblige
.
<EOS>
now
,
at
this
moment
,
her
condition
be
terribly
precarious
.
<EOS>
She
have
quarrel
with
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
have
be
take
in
by
her
old
friend
Lizzie
,
 
her
old
enemy
may
,
perhaps
,
be
a
true
expression
,
 
because
of
that
quarrel
.
<EOS>
but
a
permanent
home
have
not
even
be
promise
to
her
;
and
poor
Miss
Macnulty
be
aware
that
even
a
permanent
home
with
Lady
Eustace
would
not
be
an
unmixed
blessing
.
<EOS>
in
her
way
,
Miss
Macnulty
be
an
honest
woman
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
sit
together
one
May
afternoon
in
the
little
back
drawing
-
room
in
Mount
Street
.
<EOS>
They
have
dine
early
,
be
now
drink
tea
,
and
intend
to
go
to
the
opera
.
<EOS>
It
be
six
o'clock
,
and
be
still
broad
day
,
but
the
thick
coloured
blind
be
keep
across
the
single
window
,
and
the
fold
door
of
the
room
be
nearly
closed
,
and
there
be
a
feeling
of
evening
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
necklace
during
the
whole
day
have
be
so
heavy
on
Lizzie
's
heart
,
that
she
have
be
unable
to
apply
her
thought
to
the
building
of
that
castle
in
the
air
in
which
the
Corsair
be
to
reign
supreme
,
but
not
alone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
she
say
,
 
she
generally
call
Miss
Macnulty
<EOS>
my
dear

<EOS>
"
you

that
box
I
have
make

You

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

well

yes

only
it

<EOS>
a
safe

<EOS>
I
have
it
make
especially
for
the
diamond
Sir

me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
there
be
any
danger
about
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
you
,
Lady
Eustace
,
I
would
not
keep
them
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
them
keep
where
Sir
Florian
keep
them
.
<EOS>
suppose
anybody
should
come
and
murder
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
a
bit
afraid
of
that
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
.
<EOS>
and
what
will
you
do
with
it
when
you
go
to
Scotland
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
them
with
me
before
;
 
in
my
own
care
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
be
not
safe
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
know
what
to
do
with
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
people
who
keep
such
thing
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
then
Lizzie
pause
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
be
die
for
counsel
and
for
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
trust
them
anywhere
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
possible
there
may
be
a
lawsuit
about
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
a
lawsuit
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
explain
it
all
,
but
I
be
very
unhappy
about
it
.
<EOS>
They
want
me
to
give
them
up
;
 
but
my
husband
give
them
to
me
,
and
for
his
sake
I
will
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
when
he
throw
them
round
my
neck
<EOS>
he
tell
me
that
they
be
my
own
;
 
so
he
do
.
<EOS>
how
can
a
woman
give
up
such
a
present
,
 
from
a
husband
,
 
who
be
dead
?
<EOS>
as
to
the
value
,
I
care
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
by
this
time
Lady
Eustace
be
in
tear
,
and
have
so
far
succeed
as
to
have
produce
some
amount
of
belief
in
Miss
Macnulty
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
they
be
your
own
,
they
can
not
take
them
from
you
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
sha'n't
.
<EOS>
They
shall
find
that
I
have
get
some
spirit
leave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
she
reflect
that
a
real
Corsair
lover
would
protect
her
jewel
for
her
;
 
would
guard
them
against
a
score
of
camperdown
.
<EOS>
but
she
doubt
whether
Lord
Fawn
would
do
much
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
then
the
door
be
open
,
and
Lord
Fawn
be
announce
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
at
all
unusual
with
Lord
Fawn
to
call
on
the
widow
at
this
hour
.
<EOS>
Mount
Street
be
not
exactly
in
the
way
from
the
India
Office
to
the
House
of
Lords
;
but
a
Hansom
cab
can
make
it
almost
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
of
neglect
of
official
duty
Lord
Fawn
be
never
guilty
;
but
a
half
hour
for
private
business
or
for
relaxation
between
one
stage
of
duty
and
another
,
 
can
any
Minister
grudge
so
much
to
an
indefatigable
follower
?
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
have
be
in
tear
as
he
be
announce
,
but
the
light
of
the
room
be
so
low
that
the
trace
of
them
could
hardly
be
see
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
her
Corsair
state
of
mind
,
divide
between
her
jewel
and
her
poetry
,
and
care
not
very
much
for
the
increase
rank
which
Lord
Fawn
could
give
her
.
"
<EOS>
the
Sawab
's
case
be
come
on
in
the
House
of
Commons
this
very
night
,
"
he
say
,
in
answer
to
a
question
from
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
then
he
turn
to
Lady
Eustace
.
"
<EOS>
Your
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
be
go
to
ask
a
question
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
be
there
to
answer
him
?
"
ask
Miss
Macnulty
innocently
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
no
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
be
present
.
<EOS>
a
peer
can
go
,
you
know
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lord
Fawn
,
at
considerable
length
,
explain
to
the
two
lady
the
nature
and
condition
of
the
British
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
experience
an
innocent
pleasure
in
have
such
thing
tell
to
her
by
a
lord
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
know
that
this
be
the
way
in
which
Lord
Fawn
make
love
,
and
think
that
from
him
it
be
as
good
as
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
to
marry
a
second
time
simply
with
the
view
of
be
a
peeress
,
of
have
a
respected
husband
,
and
make
good
her
footing
in
the
world
,
she
would
as
lief
listen
to
parliamentary
detail
and
the
prospect
of
the
Sawab
as
to
any
other
matter
.
<EOS>
She
know
very
well
that
no
Corsair
propensity
would
be
forthcoming
from
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
just
work
himself
round
to
the
Sawab
again
,
when
Frank
Greystock
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
now
we
have
both
the
Houses
represent
,
"
say
Lady
Eustace
,
as
she
welcome
her
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
intend
to
ask
your
question
about
the
Sawab
to
-
night
?
"
ask
Lord
Fawn
,
with
intense
interest
,
feel
that
,
have
it
be
his
lot
to
perform
that
task
before
he
go
to
his
couch
,
he
would
at
this
moment
have
be
prepare
his
little
speech
.
  
<EOS>
but
Frank
Greystock
have
not
come
to
his
cousin
's
house
to
talk
of
the
Prince
of
the
Mygawb
territory
.
<EOS>
when
his
friend
Eustace
have
suggest
to
him
that
he
should
marry
the
widow
,
he
have
ridicule
the
idea
;
 
but
nevertheless
he
have
think
of
it
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
He
be
struggle
hard
,
work
diligently
,
make
for
himself
a
character
in
Parliament
,
succeed
,
 
<EOS>
so
say
all
his
friend
,
 
as
a
barrister
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
rise
young
man
,
one
of
those
whose
name
begin
to
be
much
in
the
mouth
of
other
man
;
 
but
still
he
be
poor
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
himself
that
among
other
good
gift
that
of
economy
have
not
be
bestow
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
owe
a
little
money
,
and
though
he
owe
it
,
he
go
on
spend
his
earning
.
<EOS>
He
want
just
such
a
lift
in
the
world
as
a
wife
with
an
income
would
give
him
.
<EOS>
as
for
look
about
for
a
girl
whom
he
could
honestly
love
,
and
who
should
have
a
fortune
of
her
own
as
well
as
beauty
,
birth
,
and
all
the
other
thing
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
out
of
his
reach
.
<EOS>
if
he
talk
to
himself
of
love
,
if
he
be
ever
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
love
be
to
have
sway
over
him
,
then
must
Lucy
Morris
be
the
mistress
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
to
know
enough
about
himself
to
be
aware
of
that
;
 
but
he
know
also
that
he
have
say
nothing
bind
him
to
walk
in
that
path
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
open
to
him
to
indulge
a
discreet
ambition
without
dishonour
.
<EOS>
therefore
he
also
have
come
to
call
upon
the
beautiful
widow
.
<EOS>
the
courtship
with
her
<EOS>
he
know
nee
not
be
long
.
<EOS>
He
could
ask
her
to
marry
him
to
-
morrow
,
 
as
for
that
matter
to
-
day
,
 
without
a
feeling
of
hesitation
.
<EOS>
She
may
accept
him
or
may
reject
him
;
but
,
as
he
say
to
himself
,
in
neither
case
would
any
harm
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
an
idea
of
the
same
kind
flit
across
Lizzie
's
mind
as
she
sit
and
talk
to
the
two
gentleman
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
her
cousin
Frank
be
poor
,
but
she
think
that
she
could
fall
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
exactly
a
Corsair
;
 
but
he
be
a
man
who
have
certain
Corsair
propensity
.
<EOS>
He
be
bold
and
dashing
,
unscrupulous
and
clever
,
a
man
to
make
a
name
for
himself
,
and
one
to
whom
a
woman
could
endure
to
be
obedient
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
choice
between
him
and
Lord
Fawn
,
if
she
be
to
allow
herself
to
choose
by
like
.
<EOS>
and
she
think
that
Frank
Greystock
would
keep
the
necklace
,
if
he
himself
be
make
to
have
an
interest
in
the
necklace
;
whereas
Lord
Fawn
would
undoubtedly
surrender
it
at
once
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
some
slight
idea
of
wait
to
see
the
cousin
go
;
but
as
Greystock
have
a
similar
idea
,
and
as
he
be
the
strong
of
the
two
,
of
course
Lord
Fawn
go
.
<EOS>
He
perhaps
remember
that
the
Hansom
cab
be
at
the
door
,
 
cost
sixpence
every
fifteen
minute
,
 
and
that
he
wish
to
show
himself
in
the
House
of
Lords
before
the
peer
rise
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
also
leave
the
room
,
and
Frank
be
alone
with
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
must
be
very
solitary
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
solitary
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
hardly
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
anything
but
happy
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
I
have
thing
that
make
me
very
unhappy
;
 
<EOS>
one
thing
that
I
will
tell
you
if
you
will
let
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
have
almost
make
up
his
mind
to
ask
her
on
the
spot
to
give
him
permission
to
console
all
her
sorrow
,
when
there
come
a
clatter
double
-
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
They
know
I
shall
be
at
home
to
nobody
else
now
,
"
say
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
but
Frank
Greystock
have
hardly
regain
his
self
-
possession
when
Miss
Macnulty
hurry
into
the
room
,
and
,
with
a
look
almost
of
horror
,
declare
that
Lady
Linlithgow
be
in
the
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
's
Mission
 
"
Lady
Linlithgow
!
"
 
<EOS>
say
Frank
Greystock
,
hold
up
both
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
!
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
speak
to
her
,
but
I
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
send
her
 
love
to
Lady
Eustace
,
and
beg
that
she
will
see
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
have
be
so
surprised
by
the
announcement
that
hitherto
she
have
not
speak
a
word
.
<EOS>
the
quarrel
between
her
and
her
aunt
have
be
of
such
a
nature
that
it
have
seem
to
be
impossible
that
the
old
countess
should
come
to
Mount
Street
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
certainly
behave
very
badly
to
her
aunt
;
 
about
as
badly
as
a
young
woman
could
behave
to
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
She
have
accept
bread
,
and
shelter
,
and
the
very
clothe
on
her
back
from
her
aunt
's
bounty
,
and
have
reject
even
the
hand
of
her
benefactress
the
first
moment
that
she
have
bread
,
and
shelter
,
and
clothe
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
and
here
be
Lady
Linlithgow
down
-
stair
in
the
parlour
,
and
send
up
her
love
to
her
niece
!
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
see
her
!
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
see
her
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
see
her
!
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
good
gracious
,
my
dear
 
what
have
she
come
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
say
it
be
very
important
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
must
see
her
,
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
get
out
of
the
house
,
and
then
tell
the
servant
to
show
her
up
at
once
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
weak
now
,
Lizzie
,
and
I
will
come
and
find
out
all
about
it
to

morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
mind
you
do
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
then
Frank
take
his
departure
,
and
Lizzie
do
as
she
be
bidden
.
<EOS>
"
You
remain
in
here
,
Julia
,
"
she
say
,
 
"
so
as
to
be
near
if
I
want
you
.
<EOS>
She
shall
come
into
the
front
room
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
absolutely
shake
with
fear
of
the
approach
evil
,
she
take
her
seat
in
the
large
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
there
be
still
a
little
delay
.
<EOS>
Time
be
give
to
Frank
Greystock
to
get
away
,
and
to
do
so
without
meet
Lady
Linlithgow
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
the
message
be
convey
by
Miss
Macnulty
to
the
servant
,
and
the
same
servant
open
the
front
door
for
Frank
before
he
deliver
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
,
too
,
though
very
strong
,
be
old
.
<EOS>
She
be
slow
,
or
perhaps
it
may
more
properly
be
say
she
be
stately
in
her
movement
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
those
old
woman
who
be
undoubtedly
old
woman
,
 
who
in
the
remembrance
of
young
people
seem
always
to
have
be
old
woman
,
 
but
on
whom
old
age
appear
to
have
no
debilitate
effect
.
<EOS>
if
the
hand
of
Lady
Linlithgow
ever
tremble
,
it
tremble
from
anger
;
 
if
her
foot
ever
falter
,
it
falter
for
effect
.
<EOS>
in
her
way
Lady
Linlithgow
be
a
very
powerful
human
being
.
<EOS>
She
know
nothing
of
fear
,
nothing
of
charity
,
nothing
of
mercy
,
and
nothing
of
the
softness
of
love
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
imagination
.
<EOS>
She
be
worldly
,
covetous
,
and
not
unfrequently
cruel
.
<EOS>
but
she
mean
to
be
true
and
honest
,
though
she
often
fail
in
her
meaning
;
 
and
she
have
an
idea
of
her
duty
in
life
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
self
-
indulgent
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
hard
as
an
oak
post
,
 
<EOS>
but
then
she
be
also
as
trustworthy
.
<EOS>
no
human
being
like
her
;
 
but
she
have
the
good
word
of
a
great
many
human
being
.
<EOS>
at
great
cost
to
her
own
comfort
she
have
endeavour
to
do
her
duty
to
her
niece
,
Lizzie
Greystock
,
when
Lizzie
be
homeless
.
<EOS>
undoubtedly
Lizzie
's
bed
,
while
it
have
be
spread
under
her
aunt
's
roof
,
have
not
be
one
of
rose
;
but
such
as
it
have
be
,
she
have
endure
to
occupy
it
while
it
serve
her
need
.
<EOS>
She
have
constrain
herself
to
bear
her
aunt
;
 
but
from
the
moment
of
her
escape
she
have
choose
to
reject
her
aunt
altogether
.
<EOS>
now
her
aunt
's
heavy
step
be
hear
upon
the
stair
!
<EOS>
Lizzie
also
be
a
brave
woman
after
a
certain
fashion
.
<EOS>
She

Her

throw

almost
stunned

<EOS>
Could
it
really
be

prosecute

<EOS>
She
be
Lady

and
who

Lady

should
have
these

allow

<EOS>
nobody
could
say
that
Sir

It

be
bring

<EOS>
Her
idea
about
law

judicial
proceeding
be
very
vague

<EOS>
of
what
be
wrong

what
be
right
<EOS>
she
have
a
distinct
notion

<EOS>
She
know
well
enough

power
there
may

prevent

punish

She
know
well
that
the
thing
be
not
really
her
own

but
there
be
,
as
she
think

so
many
point
in
her
favour

that
she
feel
it
to
be
a
cruelty

should
grudge
her
the

she
feel
certain
they

be
use

whether
they

true

false

She
would
break
her
heart
<EOS>
should
she
abandon

afterwards

have
be
wholly
powerless

she
hold
on

it

<EOS>
but
then
who
would
tell
her
the
truth

<EOS>
She
be
sharp
enough
to
understand

or
at
any
rate
suspicious
enough
to
believe

that
Mr.

would
be
actuate
by
no
other
desire

that
of
run
up

You
hear
all
that
my
aunt
say
?

I
could
not
help
hear

<EOS>
You
tell
me
to
stay
there

the
door
be
ajar

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
hear
.
<EOS>
of
course
what
she
say
be
the
great
nonsense
in
the
world

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
she
talk
about
my
be
take
to
prison
for
not
answer
a
lawyer
's
letter
,
that
must
be
nonsense
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
she
be
such
a
ferocious
old
termagant
,
 
such
an
old
vulturess

<EOS>
now
be
not
she
a
ferocious
old
termagant
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
pause
for
an
answer
,
desirous
that
her
companion
should
join
her
in
her
enmity
against
her
aunt
,
but
Miss
Macnulty
be
unwilling
to
say
anything
against
one
who
have
be
her
protectress
,
and
may
,
perhaps
,
be
her
protectress
again
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
to
say
you
do
not
hate
her

"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
not
hate
her
after
all
she
have
do
to
you

I
should
despise
you
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
hate
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
be
a
very
upsetting
old
woman
,

say
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
poor
creature
!
<EOS>
be
that
all
you
dare
to
say
about
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
oblige
to
be
a
poor
creature

Miss
Macnulty
,
with
a
red
spot
on
each
of
her
cheek

<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
understand
this
,
and
relent
.
<EOS>
"

you
need
not

afraid

she

to
tell
me
what
you

about

"
yes

about
the
diamond

"
You
have
enough

<EOS>
I
would
give

up
for
peace

quiet

<EOS>
"
that
be
Miss
Macnulty
's
advice

<EOS>
"
no
;
 
I
have
not
enough

nearly
enough

<EOS>
I
have
have

many

<EOS>
They
have
do
all
they

hard

<EOS>
They
make
me
pay
for
the
very
furniture
at
Portray

<EOS>
"
this
be
not
true
;
but
it
be
true
that
Lizzie
have
endeavour
to
palm
off
on
the
Eustace
estate
bill
for
new
thing
which
she
have
order

<EOS>
"
I
have
not
near
enough

<EOS>
I
be
in

already

<EOS>
People
talk
as
though
I

the
rich

when
it
come
to

I

why

I

there

<EOS>
this
Lizzie

with
an
evident

You

<EOS>
and
Miss

go
to

<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
she
sit
think
of
it
,
own
to
herself
that
no
help
be
to
be
expect
in
that
quarter

<EOS>
She
be
not
angry
with
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
be
,
almost
of
necessity
,
a
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
convince
more
strongly
than
ever
that
some
friend
be
necessary
to
her
who
should
not
be
a
poor
creature

<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
though
a
peer
,
be
a
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
she
believe
to
be
as
strong
as
a
house

<EOS>
Mr.
Burke
's
Speeches
 
Lucy
Morris
have
be
tell
by
Lady
Fawn
that
,
 
in
point
of
fact
that
,
be
a
governess
,
she
ought
to
give
over
fall
in
love
with
Frank
Greystock
,
and
she
have
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
no
doubt
have
use
word
less
abrupt
,
 
have
probably
use
but
few
word
,
and
have
express
her
meaning
chiefly
by
little
winks
,
and
shaking
of
her
head
,
and
small
gesture
of
her
hand
,
and
have
end
by
a
kiss
,
 
in
all
of
which
she
have
intend
to
mingle
mercy
with
justice
,
and
have
,
in
truth
,
be
full
of
love
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Lucy
have
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
no
girl
like
to
be
warn
against
fall
in
love
,
whether
the
warning
be
need
or
not
need
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
Lucy
know
very
well
that
the
caution
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
all
very
well
for
Lady
Fawn
to
decide
that
her
governess
should
not
receive
visit
from
a
lover
in
her
house
;
 
and
then
the
governess
may
decide
whether
,
in
those
circumstance
,
she
would
remain
or
go
away
;
but
Lady
Fawn
could
have
no
right
to
tell
her
governess
not
to
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
all
this
Lucy
say
to
herself
over
and
over
again
,
and
yet
she
know
that
Lady
Fawn
have
treat
her
well
.
<EOS>
the
old
woman
have
kiss
her
,
and
purr
over
her
,
and
praise
her
,
and
have
really
love
her
.
<EOS>
as
a
matter
of
course
,
Lucy
be
not
entitle
to
have
a
lover
.
<EOS>
Lucy
know
that
well
enough
.
<EOS>
as
she
walk
alone
among
the
shrub
she
make
argument
in
defence
of
Lady
Fawn
as
against
herself
.
<EOS>
and
yet
at
every
other
minute
she
would
blaze
up
into
a
grand
wrath
,
and
picture
to
herself
a
scene
in
which
she
would
tell
Lady
Fawn
boldly
that
as
her
lover
have
be
banish
from
Fawn
Court
,
she
,
Lucy
,
would
remain
there
no
longer
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
two
objection
to
this
course
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
that
Frank
Greystock
be
not
her
lover
;
and
the
second
,
that
on
leave
Fawn
Court
she
would
not
know
whither
to
betake
herself
.
<EOS>
It
be
understand
by
everybody
that
she
be
never
to
leave
Fawn
Court
till
an
unexceptionable
home
should
be
find
for
her
,
either
with
the
Hittaways
or
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
would
no
more
allow
her
to
go
away
,
depend
for
her
future
on
the
mere
chance
of
some
promiscuous
engagement
,
than
she
would
have
turn
one
of
her
own
daughter
out
of
the
house
in
the
same
forlorn
condition
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
be
a
tower
of
strength
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
but
then
a
tower
of
strength
may
at
any
moment
become
a
dungeon
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
be
not
her
lover
.
<EOS>
ah
,
 
there
be
the
bad
of
it
all
!
<EOS>
She
have
give
her
heart
and
have
get
nothing
in
return
.
<EOS>
She
con
it
all
over
in
her
own
mind
,
strive
to
ascertain
whether
there
be
any
real
cause
for
shame
to
her
in
her
own
conduct
.
<EOS>
have
she
be
unmaidenly
?
<EOS>
have
she
be
too
forward
with
her
heart
?
<EOS>
have
it
be
extract
from
her
,
as
woman
's
heart
be
extract
,
by
effort
on
the
man
's
part
;
or
have
she
simply
chuck
it
away
from
her
to
the
first
comer
?
<EOS>
then
she
remember
certain
scene
at
the
deanery
,
word
that
have
be
speak
,
look
that
have
be
turn
upon
her
,
a
pressure
of
the
hand
late
at
night
,
a
little
whisper
,
a
ribbon
that
have
be
beg
,
a
flower
that
have
be
give
;
 
and
once
,
once
 
;
then
there
come
a
burn
blush
upon
her
cheek
that
there
should
have
be
so
much
,
and
yet
so
little
that
be
of
avail
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
right
to
say
to
any
one
that
the
man
be
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
right
to
assure
herself
that
he
be
her
lover
.
<EOS>
but
she
know
that
some
wrong
be
do
her
in
that
he
be
not
her
lover
.
  
<EOS>
of
the
importance
of
her
own
self
as
a
living
thing
with
a
heart
to
suffer
and
a
soul
to
endure
,
she
think
enough
.
<EOS>
She
believe
in
herself
,
think
of
herself
,
that
should
it
ever
be
her
lot
to
be
a
man
's
wife
<EOS>
,
she
would
be
to
him
a
true
,
love
friend
and
companion
,
live
in
his
joy
,
and
fighting
,
if
it
be
necessary
,
down
to
the
stump
of
her
nail
in
his
interest
.
<EOS>
but
of
what
she
have
to
give
over
and
above
her
heart
and
intellect
she
never
think
at
all
.
<EOS>
of
personal
beauty
she
have
very
little
appreciation
even
in
other
.
<EOS>
the
form
and
face
of
Lady
Eustace
,
which
indeed
be
very
lovely
,
be
distasteful
to
her
;
whereas
she
delight
to
look
upon
the
broad
,
plain
,
colourless
countenance
of
Lydia
Fawn
,
who
be
endear
to
her
by
frank
good
humour
and
an
unselfish
disposition
.
<EOS>
in
regard
to
man
she
have
never
ask
herself
the
question
whether
this
man
be
handsome
or
that
man
ugly
.
<EOS>
of
Frank
Greystock
she
know
that
his
face
be
full
of
quick
intellect
;
and
of
Lord
Fawn
she
know
that
he
bear
no
outward
index
of
mind
.
<EOS>
one
man
she
not
only
love
,
but
could
not
help
love
;
the
other
man
,
as
regard
that
sort
of
sympathy
which
marriage
should
recognise
,
must
always
have
be
world
asunder
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
man
demand
that
woman
shall
possess
beauty
,
and
she
certainly
have
never
think
of
herself
as
beautiful
;
but
it
do
not
occur
to
her
that
on
that
account
she
be
doom
to
fail
.
<EOS>
She
be
too
strong
-
hearted
for
any
such
fear
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
think
much
of
these
thing
,
but
feel
herself
to
be
so
far
endow
as
to
be
fit
to
be
the
wife
of
such
a
man
as
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
proud
,
stout
,
self
-
confident
,
but
still
modest
little
woman
,
too
fond
of
truth
to
tell
lie
of
herself
even
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
be
possess
of
a
great
power
of
sympathy
,
genial
,
very
social
,
greatly
give
to
the
mirth
of
conversation
,
 
though
in
talk
she
would
listen
much
and
say
<EOS>
but
little
.
<EOS>
She
be
keenly
alive
to
humour
,
and
have
at
her
command
a
great
fund
of
laughter
,
which
would
illumine
her
whole
face
without
produce
a
sound
from
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
She
know
herself
to
be
too
good
to
be
a
governess
for
life
;
 
and
yet
how
could
it
be
otherwise
with
her
?
  
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
's
visit
to
her
niece
have
be
make
on
a
Thursday
,
and
on
that
same
evening
Frank
Greystock
have
ask
his
question
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
 
or
rather
have
make
his
speech
about
the
Sawab
of
Mygawb
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
the
meaning
of
such
speech
.
<EOS>
have
not
Frank
belong
to
the
party
that
be
out
,
and
have
not
the
resistance
to
the
Sawab
's
claim
come
from
the
party
that
be
in
,
Frank
would
not
probably
have
care
much
about
the
prince
.
<EOS>
We
may
be
sure
that
he
would
not
have
trouble
himself
to
read
a
line
of
that
very
dull
and
long
pamphlet
of
which
he
have
to
make
himself
master
before
he
could
venture
to
stir
in
the
matter
,
have
<EOS>
not
the
road
of
Opposition
be
open
to
him
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
but
what
exertion
will
not
a
politician
make
with
the
view
of
get
the
point
of
his
lance
within
the
joint
of
his
enemy
<EOS>
"
harness
?
<EOS>
Frank
make
his
speech
,
and
make
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
the
case
for
a
lawyer
,
admit
that
kind
of
advocacy
which
it
be
a
lawyer
's
business
to
practise
.
<EOS>
the
indian
minister
of
the
day
,
Lord
Fawn
's
chief
,
have
determine
,
after
much
anxious
consideration
,
that
it
be
his
duty
to
resist
the
claim
;
and
then
,
for
resist
it
,
he
be
attack
.
<EOS>
have
he
yield
to
the
claim
,
the
attack
would
have
be
as
venomous
,
and
very
probably
would
have
come
from
the
same
quarter
.
<EOS>
no
blame
by
such
an
assertion
be
cast
upon
the
young
conservative
aspirant
for
party
honour
.
<EOS>
It
be
thus
the
war
be
wage
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
take
up
the
Sawab
's
case
,
and
would
have
draw
mingled
tear
and
indignation
from
his
hearer
,
have
not
his
hearer
all
know
the
condition
of
the
contest
.
<EOS>
on
neither
side
do
the
hearer
care
much
for
the
Sawab
's
claim
,
but
they
feel
that
Greystock
be
make
good
his
own
claim
to
some
future
reward
from
his
party
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
hard
upon
the
minister
,
 
and
he
be
hard
also
upon
Lord
Fawn
,
state
that
the
cruelty
of
Government
ascendancy
have
never
be
put
forward
as
a
doctrine
in
plainer
term
than
those
which
have
be
use
in
"
another
place
"
in
reference
to
the
wrong
of
this
poor
ill
-
use
native
chieftain
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
grievous
to
Lord
Fawn
,
who
have
personally
desire
to
favour
the
ill
-
use
chieftain
;
 
and
harder
again
because
he
and
Greystock
be
intimate
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
He
feel
the
thing
keenly
,
and
be
full
of
his
grievance
when
,
in
accordance
with
his
custom
,
he
come
down
to
Fawn
Court
on
the
Saturday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
the
Fawn
family
,
which
consist
entirely
of

a
dinner

prepare
for
him
alone
.
<EOS>
on
Sundays
they
all
dine
together
at
three
o'clock
.
<EOS>
on
Sunday
evening
Lord
Fawn
would
return
to
town
to
prepare
himself
for
his
Monday
's
work
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
also
,
he
dislike
the
sermon
which
Lady
Fawn
always
read
to
the
assemble
household
at
nine
o'clock
on
Sunday
evening
.
<EOS>
on
this
Saturday
he
come
out
into
the
ground
after
dinner
,
where
the
old
unmarried
daughter
,
the
present
Miss
Fawn
,
be
walk
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
a
summer
evening
;
 
so
much
so
,
that
some
of
the
party
have
be
sit
on
the
garden
bench
,
and
four
of
the
girl
be
still
play
croquet
on
the
lawn
,
though
there
be
hardly
light
enough
to
see
the
ball
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fawn
have
already
tell
Lucy
that
her
brother
be
very
angry
with
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
now
,
Lucy
's
sympathy
be
all
with
Frank
and
the
Sawab
.
<EOS>
She
have
endeavour
,
indeed
,
and
have
partially
succeed
,
in
pervert
the
Under
-
Secretary
.
<EOS>
nor
do
she
now
intend
to
change
her
opinion
,
although
all
the
Fawn
girl
,
and
Lady
Fawn
,
be
against
her
.
<EOS>
when
a
brother
or
a
son
be
an
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
,
sister
and
mother
will
constantly
be
on
the
side
of
the
Government
,
so
far
as
that
Under

Secretary
's
office
be
concern
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Frederic
,
"
say
Augusta
Fawn
,
"
I
do
think
Mr.
Greystock
be
too
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
these
fellow
will
not
say

do

exclaim
Lord

<EOS>
"
I
can
not
understand
it
myself

<EOS>
when
I
have
be
in
opposition
,
I
never
do
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
it
be
because
he
be
angry
with
mamma
,
"
say
Miss
Fawn
.
<EOS>
everybody
who
know
the
Fawns
know
that
Augusta
Fawn
be
not
clever
,
and
that
she
would
occasionally
say
the
very
thing
that
ought
not
to
be
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
,
no
,
"
say
the
Under
-
Secretary
,
who
could
not
endure
the
idea
that
the
weak
woman
-
kind
of
his
family
should
have
,
in
any
way
,
an
influence
on
the
august
doing
of
Parliament

<EOS>
"
You
know
mamma

"
nothing
of
that
kind
at
all

"
say
his
lordship
,
put
down
his
sister
with
great
authority
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
be
simply
not
an
honest
politician
.
<EOS>
that
be
about
the
whole
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
choose
to
attack
me
because
there
be
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
man
in
either
House
who
care
for
such
thing
,
personally
,
less
than
I
do
;
"
 
have
his
lordship
say
"
more
than
he
do
,
"
he
may
,
perhaps
,
have
be
correct
;
 
"
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
bear
the
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
a
lawyer
never
understand
what
be
and
what
be
not
fair
fighting
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
feel
her
face
tingle
with
heat
,
and
be
prepare
to
say
a
word
in
defence
of
that
special
lawyer
,
when
Lady
Fawn
's
voice
be
hear
from
the
drawing

room
window

<EOS>
"
come

<EOS>
It

that
house
Lady

supreme

and
no
one
ever
doubt
,
for
a
moment
,
as
to
obedience
.
<EOS>
the
clicking
of
the
ball
cease
,
and
those
who
be
walk
immediately
turn
their
face
to
the
drawing
-
room
window
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
Fawn
,
who
be
not
one
of
the
girl
,
take
another
turn
by
himself
,
think
of
the
wrong
he
have
endure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frederic
be
so
angry
about
Mr.

,
"

Augusta
,
as
soon
as
they
be

<EOS>
"
I
do
feel
that
it
be
provoke

the
second
sister

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

consider
that
Mr.

<EOS>
Lydia
do
not

could
not

<EOS>
"
I
believe
everything

consider
fair

transgress

this
his
lordship
say
with
that
haughty
superiority
which
a
man
may
generally
display
with
safety
among
the
woman
of
his
own
family

<EOS>
Lucy
have
bear
a
great
deal
,
know
well
that
it
be
well
that
she
should
bear
such
injury
in
silence
;
 
but
there
be
a
point
beyond
which
she
could
not
endure
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
intolerable
to
her
that
Mr.
Greystock
's
character
as
a
gentleman
should
be
impugn
before
all
the
lady
of
the
family
,
every
one
of
whom
do
,
in
fact
,
know
her
like
for
the
man

<EOS>
and
then
it
seem
to
her
that
she
could
rush
into
the
battle
,
give
a
side
blow
at
his
lordship
on
behalf
of
his
absent
antagonist
,
but
appear
to
fight
for
the
Sawab

<EOS>
there
have
be
a
time
when
the
poor
Sawab
be
in
favour
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
Mr.
Greystock
be
right
to
say
all
he
could
for
the
prince

if
he
take
up
the
cause

bind

<EOS>
She
speak
with
energy

with
a
heightened
colour

Lady

hear
her
,
shake
her

at
her

say
that
Mr.

unbecoming

very
good

with
headlong
energy

you

very
different
opinion
about

Lord

with
severity

You
have
,
probably
,
never

question

Poor

She
know
quite
as
well
as
do
Lord

that
Burke
have
be
a
House
of

orator

in
her
impatience

from
absence
of
the

she
omit

<EOS>
no

Lady
Fawn
!

<EOS>
"
but
it
make
me
unhappy
when
I
see
your
mind
engage
about
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
truth
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
You
should
not
think
of
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
be
a
man
who
have
his
way
to
make
in
the
world
,
and
could
not
marry
you
,
even
if
,
under
other
circumstance
,
he
would
wish
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
frank
I
be
with
you
,
give
you
credit
for
honest
,
sound
good
sense
.
<EOS>
to
me
and
to
my
girl
,
who
know
you
as
a
lady
,
you
be
as
dear
a
friend
as
though
you
be
 
be
anything
you
may
please
to
think
.
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
be
to
us
our
own
dear
,
dear
little
friend
Lucy
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Greystock
,
who
be
a
Member
of
Parliament
,
could
not
marry
a
governess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
love
him
so
dearly
,
"
say
Lucy
,
get
up
from
her
chair
,
"
that
his
slight
word
be
to
me
more
than
all
the
word
of
all
the
world
beside
!
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
I
do
love
him
,
and
I
do
not
mean
to
try
to
give
it
up
!
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
stand
silent
for
a
moment
,
and
then
suggest
that
it
would
be
well
for
them
both
to
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
during
that
minute
she
have
be
unable
to
decide
what
she
have
better
say
or
do
in
the
present
emergency
.
   
<EOS>
the
Conquering
Hero
come
 
<EOS>
the
reader
will
perhaps
remember
that
when
Lizzie
Eustace
be
tell
that
her
aunt
be
down
-
stair
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
be
with
her
,
and
that
he
promise
to
return
on
the
follow
day
to
hear
the
result
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
have
Lady
Linlithgow
not
come
at
that
very
moment
<EOS>
Frank
would
probably
have
ask
his
rich
cousin
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
him
that
she
be
solitary
and
unhappy
;
and
after
that
what
else
could
he
have
do
but
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
?
<EOS>
the
old
countess
,
however
,
arrive
,
and
interrupt
him
.
<EOS>
He
go
away
abruptly
,
promise
to
come
on
the
morrow
;
 
but
on
the
morrow
he
never
come
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
Friday
,
and
Lizzie
remain
at
home
for
him
the
whole
morning
.
<EOS>
when
four
o'clock
be
pass
she
know
that
he
would
be
at
the
House
.
<EOS>
but
still
she
do
not
stir
.
<EOS>
and
she
contrive
that
Miss
Macnulty
should
be
absent
the
entire
day
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
be
even
make
to
go
to
the
play
by
herself
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
but
her
absence
be
of
no
service
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
come
not
;
and
at
eleven
at
night
Lizzie
swear
to
herself
that
should
he
ever
come
again
,
he
should
come
in
vain
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
through
the
whole
of
Saturday
she
expect
him
with
more
or
less
of
confidence
,
and
on
the
Sunday
morning
she
be
still
well
-
inclined
towards
him
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
would
come
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
She
could
understand
that
a
man
with
his
hand
so
full
of
business
,
as
be
those
of
her
cousin
Frank
,
should
find
himself
unable
to
keep
an
appointment
.
<EOS>
nor
would
there
be
fair
ground
for
permanent
anger
with
such
a
one
,
even
should
he
forget
an
appointment
.
<EOS>
but
surely
he
would
come
on
the
Sunday
!
<EOS>
She
have
be
quite
sure
that
the
offer
be
about
to
be
make
when
that
odious
old
harridan
have
come
in
and
disturb
everything
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
offer
have
be
all
but
make
.
<EOS>
She
have
feel
the
premonitory
flutter
,
have
ask
herself
the
important
question
,
 
and
have
answer
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
herself
that
the
thing
would
do
.
<EOS>
Frank
be
not
the
exact
hero
that
her
fancy
have
paint
,
 
but
he
be
sufficiently
heroic
.
<EOS>
everybody
say
that
he
would
work
his
way
up
to
the
top
of
the
tree
,
and
become
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
she
have
resolve
;
 
and
then
Lady
Linlithgow
have
come
in
!
<EOS>
surely
he
would
come
on
the
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
come
on
the
Sunday
,
but
Lord
Fawn
do
come
.
<EOS>
immediately
after
morning
church
Lord
Fawn
declare
his
intention
of
return
at
once
from
Fawn
Court
to
town
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
silent
at
breakfast
,
and
his
sister
surmise
that
he
be
still
angry
with
poor
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
too
,
be
unlike
herself
,
 
be
silent
,
sad
,
and
oppress
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
be
serious
,
and
almost
solemn
;
 
so
that
there
be
little
even
of
holy
mirth
at
Fawn
Court
on
that
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
the
whole
family
,
however
,
go
to
church
,
and
immediately
on
their
return
Lord
Fawn
express
his
intention
of
return
to
town
.
<EOS>
all
the
sister
feel
that
an
injury
have
be
do
to
them
by
Lucy
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
on
Sundays
that
their
dinner
-
table
be
grace
by
the
male
member
of
the
family
,
and
now
he
be
drive
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
that
you
be
go
to
desert
us
,
Frederic
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
mutter
something
as
to
absolute
necessity
,
and
go
.
<EOS>
the
afternoon
be
very
dreary
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
say
on
the
subject
;
but
there
be
still
the
feeling
that
Lucy
have
offend
.
<EOS>
at
four
o'clock
on
that
Sunday
afternoon
Lord
Fawn
be
closet
with
Lady
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
the
"
closeting
"
consist
simply
in
the
fact
that
Miss
Macnulty
be
not
present
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
fully
appreciate
the
pleasure
,
and
utility
,
and
general
convenience
of
have
a
companion
,
but
she
have
no
scruple
<EOS>
whatever
in
obtain
absolute
freedom
for
herself
when
she
desire
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
the
good
friend
in
the
world
should
not
always
be
together
;
should
they
?
<EOS>
Would
not
you
like
to
go
to
the
Horticultural
?
"
<EOS>
then
Miss
Macnulty
would
go
to
the
Horticultural
,
 
or
else
up
into
her
own
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
when
Lizzie
be
begin
to
wax
wrathful
again
because
Frank
Greystock
do
not
come
,
Lord
Fawn
make
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
how
kind
this
be
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
always
at
Richmond
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
come
up
from
my
mother
's
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
twiddle
his
hat
.
<EOS>
then
Lizzie
,
with
a
pretty
eagerness
,
ask
after
Lady
Fawn
and
the
girl
,
and
her
dear
little
friend
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
could
be
very
prettily
eager
when
she
please
.
<EOS>
She
lean
forward
her
face
as
she
ask
her
question
,
and
throw
back
her
loose
lustrous
lock
of
hair
,
with
her
long
lithe
finger
cover
with
diamond
,
 
the
diamond
,
these
,
which
Sir
Florian
have
really
give
her
,
or
which
she
have
procure
from
Mr.
Benjamin
in
the
clever
manner
describe
in
the
opening
chapter
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
,
all
quite
well
,
thank
you
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
Miss
Morris
be
quite
well
,
though
she
be
a
little
out
of
sort
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
ill
,
I
hope
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
bring
the
lustrous
lock
forward
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
her
temper
,
I
mean
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
hope
Miss
Lucy
be
not
forget
herself
.
<EOS>
that
would
be
very
sad
,
after
the
great
kindness
she
have
receive
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
say
that
it
would
be
very
sad
,
and
then
put
his
hat
down
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
It
come
upon
Lizzie
at
that
moment
,
as
by
a
flash
of
lightning
,
 
by
an
electric
message
deliver
to
her
intellect
by
that
movement
of
the
hat
,
 
that
she
may
be
sure
of
Lord
Fawn
if
she
choose
to
take
him
.
<EOS>
on
Friday
she
may
have
be
sure
of
Frank
,
 
only
that
Lady
Linlithgow
come
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
but
now
she
do
not
feel
at
all
sure
of
Frank
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
at
any
rate
a
peer
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
that
he
be
a
poor
peer
,
 
but
a
peer
<EOS>
,
she
think
,
can
not
be
altogether
poor
.
<EOS>
and
though
he
be
a
stupid
owl
,
 
she
do
not
hesitate
to
acknowledge
to
herself
that
he
be
as
stupid
as
an
owl
,
 
he
have
a
position
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
the
Government
,
and
his
wife
would
,
no
doubt
,
be
able
to
go
anywhere
.
<EOS>
It
be
become
essential
to
her
that
she
should
marry
.
<EOS>
even
though
her
husband
should
give
up
the
diamond
,
she
would
not
in
such
case
incur
the
disgrace
of
surrender
them
herself
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
keep
them
till
she
have
cease
to
be
a
eustace
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
certainly
mean
it
on
that
Thursday
afternoon
;
 
but
surely
he
would
have
be
in
Mount
Street
before
this
if
he
have
not
change
his
mind
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
a
bird
in
the
hand
be
worth
two
in
the
bush
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
at
Fawn
Court
once
or
twice
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
with
her
sweetest
grace
,
"
and
I
always
think
it
a
model
of
real
family
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
may
be
there
very
often
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
I
have
no
right
to
intrude
myself
often
on
your
mother
,
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
could
hardly
be
a
well
opening
than
this
for
him
<EOS>
have
he
choose
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
thus
that
he
have
arrange
it
,
 
for
he
have
make
his
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
there
would
be
no
feeling
of
that
kind
,
I
be
sure
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
be
silent
.
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
deploy
himself
on
the
ground
before
him
so
as
to
make
the
strategy
which
he
have
prepare
answer
the
occasion
of
the
day
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
do
not
know
what
your
view
of
life
may
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
child
,
you
know
,
to
bring
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
;
 
that
give
a
great
interest
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
inherit
a
very
large
fortune
,
Lord
Fawn
;
 
too
large
,
I
fear
,
to
be
of
service
to
a
youth
of
one
-
and
-
twenty
;
and
I
must
endeavour
to
fit
him
for
the
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
that
is
,
 
and
always
must
be
,
the
chief
object
of
my
existence
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
feel
that
she
have
say
too
much
.
<EOS>
He
be
just
the
man
who
would
be
fool
enough
to
believe
her
.
"
<EOS>
not
but
what
it
be
hard
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
a
mother
can
of
course
devote
herself
to
her
child
;
 
but
when
a
portion
of
the
devotion
must
be
give
to
the
preservation
of
material
interest
there
be
less
of
tenderness
in
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
doubt
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
;
 
"
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
but
he
have
not
follow
her
,
and
be
still
think
of
his
own
strategy
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
comfort
,
of
course
,
to
know
that
one
's
child
be
provide
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
 
but
they
tell
me
the
poor
little
dear
will
have
forty
thousand
a
year
when
he
be
of
age
;
and
when
I
look
at
him
in
his
little
bed
,
and
press
him
in
my
arm
,
and
think
of
all
that
money
,
I
almost
wish
that
his
father
have
be
a
poor
plain
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
then
the
handkerchief
be
put
to
her
eye
,
and
Lord
Fawn
have
a
moment
in
which
to
collect
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
myself
be
a
poor
man
;
 
for
my
rank
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
man
with
your
position
,
Lord
Fawn
,
and
your
talent
and
genius
for
business
,
can
never
be
poor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My

property
be
all
irish

you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
indeed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
be
an
irish
peer
,
till
Lord
Melbourne
give
him
an
english
peerage
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
an
irish
peer

be
he

"
<EOS>
Lizzie
understand
nothing
of
this
,
but
presume
that
an
irish
peer
be
a
peer
who
have
not
sufficient
money
to
live
upon
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
however
,
be
endeavour
to
describe
his
own
history
in
as
few
word
as
possible

Court

there

"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
house
,
but
my
father
allow
it
to
tumble
down
.
<EOS>
It

in
Tipperary

what
an

there
be
so
long
a
pause
make
between
each
statement
that

be
force
to
make
some
reply

You
see

the
fortune

it

you

I
be
afraid

however
,
there
be
a
great
many
people

do
not

so

Your

Greystock

do
anything

out

<EOS>
"
luckily

my

and
in
say
it
she
throw
into
her
tone

into
her
countenance
,
a
certain
amount
of
contempt
for
Frank
as
a
man

as
a
politician

which
be
pleasant
to
Lord
Fawn

He
be
now
stand
upright
before
her

with
the
finger
of
his

touch
his

something
almost
of
dignity

when
she
have
listen
to
him
thus
far

of
course
she
must
accept
him
;

he
be
by
no

aware

that

She
sit
silent
,
with

fold
on

look
down

Lady

may
I
venture

<EOS>
"
May
I
not
have
an
hour

Lizzie

just
venture
to
turn
a
glance
of
her
eye
upon
his
face

oh
,
certainly

<EOS>
I
will
call
again

now
she
be
silent
for
two
or
three
minute
,
during
which
he
still
stand
over
her

but
he
have
drop
his
hand
from
his

have
stoop
,

pick
up
his

Tuesday

Wednesday

<EOS>
let
her
tell
him
that
<EOS>

he
would
go

<EOS>
He
doubtless
reflect
that
Wednesday
would
suit
him
best
,
because
there
would
be
no
House

<EOS>

Lizzie
be
too
magnanimous
for
this

Lord

she

,
rise
,

the

this

whisper

then
she
move
towards
him
gently

almost
lay
her
head
upon
his
breast
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
,

it
be
first
necessary
that
he
should
once
more
disembarrass
himself
of

then
her
head
be
upon

then
he
kiss
her
again
,
 
her
forehead

take
his

promise
to
be
with

at

on

<EOS>
"
Lady
Fawn
!

<EOS>
she
say
to
herself
.
<EOS>
the
name
do
not
sound
so
well
as
that
of
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
much
to
be
a
wife
;
and
more
to
be
a
peeress
.
   
<EOS>
show
what
the
Miss
Fawns
say
,
and
what
Mrs.
Hittaway
think
 
<EOS>
in
the
way
of
duty
Lord
Fawn
be
a
Hercules
,
 
not
,
indeed
,
"
climb
tree
in
the
Hesperides
,
"
but
achieve
enterprise
which
,
to
other
man
,
if
not
impossible
,
would
have
be
so
unpalatable
as
to
have
be
put
aside
as
impracticable
.
<EOS>
on
the
Monday
morning
,
after
he
be
accept
by
Lady
Eustace
,
he
be
with
his
mother
at
Fawn
Court
before
he
go
down
to
the
India
Office
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
at
least
be
very
honest
in
the
description
he
have
give
of
his
own
circumstance
to
the
lady
whom
he
intend
to
marry
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
her
the
exact
truth
;
and
though
she
,
with
all
her
cleverness
,
have
not
be
able
to
realise
the
fact
when
relate
to
her
so
suddenly
,
still
enough
have
be
say
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
,
when
detail
of
business
should
hereafter
be
discuss
in
a
less
hurried
manner
,
he
would
be
able
to
say
that
he
have
explain
all
his
circumstance
before
he
have
make
his
offer
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
be
careful
,
too
,
as
to
her
affair
.
<EOS>
He
have
ascertain
that
her
late
husband
have
certainly
settle
upon
her
for
life
<EOS>
an
estate
worth
four
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
also
,
that
eight
thousand
pound
have
be
leave
her
,
but
of
that
he
take
no
account
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
probable
that
she
have
spend
it
.
<EOS>
if
any
of
it
be
leave
,
it
would
be
a
godsend
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
think
a
great
deal
about
money
.
<EOS>
be
a
poor
man
,
fill
a
place
fit
only
for
rich
man
,
he
have
be
drive
to
think
of
money
,
and
have
become
self
-
deny
and
parsimonious
,
 
<EOS>
perhaps
we
may
say
hungry
and
close
-
fisted
.
<EOS>
such
a
condition
of
character
be
the
natural
consequence
of
such
a
position
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
probably
,
no
man
who
become
naturally
so
hard
in
regard
to
money
as
he
who
be
bind
to
live
among
rich
man
,
who
be
not
rich
himself
,
and
who
be
yet
honest
.
<EOS>
the
weight
of
the
work
of
life
in
these
circumstance
be
so
crush
,
require
such
continue
thought
,
and
make
itself
so
continually
feel
,
that
the
mind
of
the
sufferer
be
never
free
from
the
contamination
of
sixpence
.
<EOS>
of
such
a
one
it
be
not
fair
to
judge
as
of
other
man
with
similar
income
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
declare
to
his
future
bride
that
he
have
half
five
thousand
a
year
to
spend
,
 
or
the
half
,
rather
,
of
such
actual
income
as
may
be
get
in
from
an
estate
presume
to
give
five
thousand
a
year
,
 
and
it
may
be
say
that
an
unmarried
gentleman
ought
not
to
be
poor
with
such
an
income
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
Fawn
unfortunately
be
a
lord
,
unfortunately
be
a
landlord
,
unfortunately
be
an
irish
landlord
.
<EOS>
let
him
be
as
careful
as
he
may
with
his
sixpence
,
his
pound
would
fly
from
him
,
or
,
as
might
,
perhaps
,
be
well
say
,
could
not
be
make
to
fly
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
careful
with
his
sixpence
,
and
be
always
think
,
not
exactly
how
he
may
make
two
end
meet
,
but
how
to
reconcile
the
strict
personal
economy
with
the
proper
bearing
of
an
english
nobleman
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
man
almost
naturally
look
to
marriage
as
an
assistance
in
the
dreary
fight
.
<EOS>
It
soon
become
clear
to
him
that
he
can
not
marry
without
money
,
and
he
learn
to
think
that
heiress
have
be
invent
exactly
to
suit
his
case
.
<EOS>
He
be
conscious
of
have
be
subject
to
hardship
by
Fortune
,
and
regard
female
wealth
as
his
legitimate
mode
of
escape
from
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
get
himself
,
his
position
,
and
,
perhaps
,
his
title
to
dispose
of
,
and
they
be
surely
worth
so
much
per
annum
.
<EOS>
as
for
give
anything
away
,
that
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
so
place
as
to
be
able
to
give
.
<EOS>
but
,
be
an
honest
man
,
he
will
,
if
possible
,
make
a
fair
bargain
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
certainly
an
honest
man
,
and
he
have
be
endeavour
for
the
last
six
or
seven
year
to
make
a
fair
bargain
.
<EOS>
but
then
it
be
so
hard
to
decide
what
be
fair
.
<EOS>
who
be
to
tell
a
Lord
Fawn
how
much
per
annum
he
ought
to
regard
himself
as
worth
?
<EOS>
He
have
,
on
one
or
two
occasion
,
ask
a
high
price
,
but
no
previous
bargain
have
be
make
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
have
come
down
a
little
in
his
demand
in
suggest
a
matrimonial
arrangement
to
a
widow
with
a
child
,
and
with
only
four
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
whether
or
no
that
income
be
her
in
perpetuity
,
or
only
for
life
,
he
have
not
positively
know
when
he
make
his
offer
.
<EOS>
the
will
make
by
Sir
Florian
Eustace
do
not
refer
to
the
property
at
all
.
<EOS>
in
the
natural
course
of
thing
,
the
widow
would
only
have
a
life
-
interest
in
the
income
.
<EOS>
why
should
Sir
Florian
make
away
,
in
perpetuity
,
with
his
family
property
?
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
there
have
be
a
rumour
abroad
that
Sir
Florian
have
be
very
generous
;
that
the
Scotch
estate
be
to
go
to
a
second
son
in
the
event
of
there
be
a
second
son
;
 
but
that
otherwise
it
be
to
be
at
the
widow
's
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
have
Lord
Fawn
be
persistent
,
he
may
have
find
out
the
exact
truth
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
calculate
that
he
could
afford
to
accept
even
the
life
-
income
.
<EOS>
if
more
should
come
of
it
,
so
much
the
well
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
may
,
at
any
rate
,
so
arrange
the
family
matter
,
that
his
heir
,
should
he
have
one
,
should
not
at
his
death
be
call
upon
to
pay
something
more
than
half
the
proceed
of
the
family
property
to
his
mother
,
 
as
be
now
do
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
breakfast
at
Fawn
Court
on
the
Monday
,
and
his
mother
sit
at
the
table
with
him
,
pour
out
his
tea
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frederic
<EOS>
,
"
she
say
,
"
it
be
so
important
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
so
;
 
very
important
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
you
to
call
and
see
her
either
to

day
or
to

morrow

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
of
course

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

and
you
have
better
get
her
down
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
she
will
come
.
<EOS>
Ought
I
to
ask
the
little
boy
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
as
he
put
a
spoonful
of
egg
into
his
mouth
;
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
Miss
Macnulty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
do
not
see
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
marry
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
the
child
,
of
course
,
must
be
one
of
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
the
income
,
Frederic
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
four
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
something
more
,
nominally
,
but
four
thousand
to
spend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
sure
about
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
for
ever
?
"
  
"
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
of
that
I
be
not
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
make
a
great
difference
,
Frederic
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
great
difference
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
her
own
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
any
rate
,
she
be
much
young
than
I
be
,
and
there
need
be
no
settlement
out
of
my
property
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
great
thing
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
she
be
 
nice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
lovely
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
clever
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
certainly
very
clever
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
be
not
self
-
willed
,
Frederic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
she
be
,
we
must
try
and
balance
it
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
with
a
little
smile
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
he
have
think
nothing
about
any
such
quality
as
that
to
which
his
mother
now
refer
.
<EOS>
the
lady
have
an
income
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
first
and
most
indispensable
consideration
.
<EOS>
She
be
fairly
well
-
bear
,
be
a
lady
,
and
be
beautiful
.
<EOS>
in
do
Lord
Fawn
justice
,
we
must
allow
that
,
in
all
his
attempt
matrimonial
speculation
,
some
amount
of
feminine
loveliness
have
be
combine
with
feminine
wealth
.
<EOS>
He
have
for
two
year
be
a
suitor
of
Violet
Effingham
,
who
be
the
acknowledge
beauty
of
the
day
,
 
of
Violet
Effingham
who
,
at
the
present
time
,
be
the
wife
of
Lord
Chiltern
;
and
he
have
offer
himself
thrice
to
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
who
be
repute
to
be
as
rich
as
she
be
beautiful
.
<EOS>
in
either
case
,
the
fortune
would
have
be
great
than
that
which
he
would
now
win
,
and
the
money
would
certainly
have
be
for
ever
.
<EOS>
but
in
these
attempt
he
have
fail
;
and
Lord
Fawn
be
not
a
man
to
think
himself
ill

<EOS>
He
do
not
see
why
this
woman
he
be
about
to
marry
should
not
be
a
good
wife
to
him
!
<EOS>
and
yet
he
know
nothing
about
her
,
and
have
not
take
the
slight
trouble
to
make
inquiry
.
<EOS>
that
she
be
pretty
he
could
see
;
that
she
be
clever
<EOS>
he
could
understand
;
that
she
live
in
Mount

be
a
fact
;
her
parentage
be
know

him

that
she
be
the
undoubted
mistress
of
a
large
income
be
beyond
dispute

<EOS>
but
,
for
aught
he
know
,
she
may
be
afflict
by
every
vice
to
which
a
woman
can
be
subject
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
she
be
afflict
by
so
many
,
that
the
addition
of
all
the
other
could
hardly
have
make
her
bad
than
she
be
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
sacrifice
her
beauty
to
a
lover
,
 
she
have
never
sacrifice
anything
to
anybody
,
 
nor
do
she
drink

<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
,
perhaps
,
to
say
anything
else
in
her
favour
;
and
yet
Lord
Fawn
be
quite
content
to
marry
her
,
not
have
see
any
reason

she
should
not
make
a
good

have
Sir

she

break
Sir

<EOS>
when

<EOS>
Lady
Fawn

very
much
out

<EOS>
They
also
be
poor
rich
people
,
 
if
such
a
term
may
be
use

do
not
go
much
into
society

<EOS>
there

<EOS>
there

<EOS>
with
such
encumbrance

and
an
income
altogether
not
exceed
three
thousand
pound

,
Lady

could
not

rich

<EOS>
and
yet
who
would
say
that
an
old
lady
and
her
daughter
could
be
poor
with
three
thousand
pound
a
year
to
spend
?
<EOS>
It
may
be
take
almost
as
a
rule
by
the
unennobled
one
of
this
country
,
that
the
sudden
possession
of
a
title
would
at
once
raise
the
price
of
every
article
consume
twenty
per
cent
.
<EOS>
mutton
that
before
cost
ninepence
would
cost
tenpence
a
pound
,
and
the
mouth
to

feed
would
demand
more
meat

<EOS>
the

in

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
It
be

therefore

the
case
that

have

they
have
hear
something

"

for

Frederic
can
see
just
as
far
as
some

not

<EOS>
of

she
have

You

It

I
will
learn

and
when

Mr.

I

no

know
all

in

out

<EOS>
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
be
this
,
mamma
,
that
I
have
hear
quite
enough
about
Lady
Eustace
to
feel
certain
that
Frederic
would
live
to
repent
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
can
we
do

"
say
Lady
Fawn

<EOS>
"
break
it
off

say
Mrs.

<EOS>
Her
daughter
's
violence
of
speech
have
a
most
depressing
effect
upon
poor
Lady
Fawn

<EOS>
as
have
be
say
,
she
do
believe
in
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
Mrs.

be
conversant
with
the
thing
of
the
world

and
hear
tiding
daily
which
never
find
their
way
down

Fawn
Court

<EOS>
and
yet
her
son
go
about
quite
as
much
as
do
her

<EOS>
if
Lady
Eustace
be
such
a
reprobate
as
be
now
represent
,
why
have
not
Lord
Fawn
hear
the
truth
?
<EOS>
and
then
she
have
already
give
in
her
own
adhesion
,
and
have
promise
to
call
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
mean
that
you
will
not
go

"
say
Lady

<EOS>
"
as
Lady
Eustace
,
 
certainly
not

<EOS>
if
Frederic
do
marry
her

of
course
I
must
know
her
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
different
thing
.
<EOS>
one
have
to
make
the
good
one
can
of
a
bad
bargain

<EOS>
I
do
not

they
would
be
separate
before
two
year
be
over

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
,
how
dreadful
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
after
much
consideration
,
be
of
opinion
that
she
must
carry
out
her
intention
of
call
upon
her
son
's
intend
bride
in
spite
of
all
the
evil
thing
that
have
be
say
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
undertake
to
send
a
message
to
Mount
Street
,
inform
the
lady
of
the
honour
intend
for
her
.
<EOS>
and
in
truth
Lady
Fawn
be
somewhat
curious
now
to
see
the
household
of
the
woman
who
may
perhaps
do
her
the
irreparable
injury
of
ruin
the
happiness
of
her
only
son
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
may
learn
something
by
look
at
the
woman
in
her
own
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
she
would
go
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
word
have
the
effect
of
induce
her
to
leave
Augusta
where
she
be
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
contamination
,
why
should
Augusta
be
contaminate
?
<EOS>
Poor
Augusta
!
<EOS>
She
have
look
forward
to
the
delight
of
embrace
her
future
sister
-
in
-
law
;
 
and
would
not
have
enjoy
it
the
less
,
perhaps
,
because
she
have
be
tell
that
the
lady
be
false
,
profligate
,
and
a
vixen
.
<EOS>
as
,
however
,
her
position
be
that
of
a
girl
,
she
be
bind
to
be
obedient
,
 
though
over
thirty
year
old
,
 
and
she

Horticultural
Gardens
or

<EOS>
on
such
an
occasion
Lizzie

<EOS>
She
have
take
great
pain
with
her
dress
,
study
not
so
much
her
own
appearance
as
the
character
of
her
visitor

<EOS>
She
be
very
anxious
,
at
any
rate
for
the
present
,
to
win
golden
opinion
from
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
She
be
dress
richly
,
but
very
simply
.
<EOS>
everything
about
her
room
betoken
wealth

but
she
have
put
away
the
french
novel
,
and
have
place
a
Bible
on
a
little
table
,
not
quite
hide
,
behind
her
own
seat
.
<EOS>
the
long
lustrous
lock
be
tuck
up
,
but
the
diamond
be
still
upon
her
finger
.
<EOS>
She
fully
intend
to
make
a
conquest
of
her
future
mother
-
in
-
law
and
sister
-
in
-
law
;
 
for
the
note
which
have
come
up
to
her
from
the
India
Office
have
tell
her
that
Augusta
would
accompany
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
Augusta
be
my
favourite
sister
,
"
say
the
enamoured
lover
,
"
and
I
hope
that
you
two
will
always
be
friend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
have
read
this
,
have
declare
to
herself
that
of
all
the
female
oafs
she
have
ever
see
,
Augusta
Fawn
be
the
great
oaf
.
<EOS>
when
she
find
that
Lady
Fawn
be
alone
,
she
do
not
betray
herself
,
or
ask
for
the
beloved
friend
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
dear
,
dear
Lady
Fawn
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
throw
herself
into
the
arm
and
nestle
herself
against
the
bosom
of
the
old
lady
<EOS>
,
"
this
make
my
happiness
perfect
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
she
retreat
a
little
,
still
hold
the
hand
she
have
grasp
between
her
own
,
and
look
up
into
the
face
of
her
future
mother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
when
he
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
,
the
first
thing
I
think
of
be
whether
you
would
come
to
me
at
once
.
"
<EOS>
Her
voice
as
she
thus
speak
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
almost
perfect
.
<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
a
little
too
much
of
gesture
,
too
much
glide
motion
,
too
violent
an
appeal
with
the
eye
,
too
close
a
pressure
of
the
hand
.
<EOS>
no
suspicion
,
however
,
of
all
this
would
have
touch
Lady
Fawn
have
she
come
to
Mount
Street
without
call
in
Warwick
Square
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
but
those
horrible
word
of
her
daughter
be
ring
in
her
ear
,
and
she
do
not
know
how
to
conduct
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
come
as
soon
as
he
tell
me
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
be
a
mother
to
me
?
"
demand
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Fawn
!
<EOS>
there
be
enough
of
maternity
about
her
to
have
enable
her
to
undertake
the
duty
for
a
dozen
son
"
wife
,
 
if
the
wife
be
woman
with
whom
she
could
feel
sympathy
.
<EOS>
and
she
could
feel
sympathy
very
easily
;
and
be
a
woman
not
at
all
prone
to
inquire
too
curiously
as
to
the
merit
of
a
son
's
wife
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
she
to
do
after
the
caution
she
have
receive
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
?
<EOS>
how
be
she
to
promise
maternal
tenderness
to
a
vixen
and
a
liar
?
<EOS>
by
nature
she
be
not
a
deceitful
woman
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
hope
you
will
make
him
a
good
wife
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
encouraging
,
but
Lizzie
make
the
good
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
desire
to
cheat
Lady
Fawn
into
a
good
opinion
,
and
she
be
not
disappointed
when
no
good
opinion
be
express
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
be
seldom
that
a
bad
person
expect
to
be
account
good
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
general
desire
of
such
a
one
to
conquer
the
exist
evil
impression
;
but
it
be
generally
presume
that
the
evil
impression
be
there
.
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Lady
Fawn
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
"
I
will
so
strive
to
make
him
happy
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
that
he
like
?
<EOS>
what
would
he
wish
me
to
do
and
to
be
?
<EOS>
You
know
his
noble
nature
,
and
I
must
look
to
you
for
guidance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
be
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
She
have
now
seat
herself
on
the
sofa
,
and
Lizzie
be
close
to
her
,
almost
envelop
within
her
mantle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
,
"
if
you
will
endeavour
to
do
your
duty
by
him
,
I
be
sure
he
will
do
his
by
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
I
will
;
I
will
.
<EOS>
You
will
let
me
love
you
,
and
call
you
mother
?
"
<EOS>
a
peculiar
perfume
come
up
from
Lizzie
's
hair
which
Lady
Fawn
do
not
like
.
<EOS>
Her
own
girl
,
perhaps
,
be
not
give
to
the
use
of
much
perfumery
.
<EOS>
She
shift
her
seat
a
little
,
and
Lizzie
be
compel
to
sit
upright
,
and
without
support
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
Lady
Fawn
have
say
very
little
,
and
Lizzie
's
part
be
one
difficult
to
play
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
of
that
sermon
read
every
Sunday
evening
at
Fawn
Court
,
and
she
believe
that
Lady
Fawn
be
peculiarly
religious
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
there
,
"
she
say
,
stretch
out
her
hand
backwards
and
clasp
the
book
which
lie
upon
the
small
table
,
 
"
there
;
that
shall
be
my
guide
.
<EOS>
that
will
teach
me
how
to
do
my
duty
by
my
noble
husband
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
in
some
surprise
take
the
book
from
Lizzie
's
hand
,
and
find
that
it
be
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
"
You
certainly
can
not
do
well
,
my
dear
,
than
read
your
Bible
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
,
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
more
of
censure
than
of
eulogy
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
.
<EOS>
She
put
the
Bible
down
very
quietly
,
and
ask
Lady
Eustace
when
it
would
suit
her
to
come
down
to
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
promise
her
son
to
give
the
invitation
,
and
could
not
now
,
she
think
,
avoid
give
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
should
like
it
so
much
!
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
whenever
it
will
suit
you
,
I
will
be
there
at
a
minute
's
notice
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
then
arrange
that
she
should
be
at
Fawn
Court
on
that
day
week
,
and
stay
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
of
all
thing
that
which
I
most
desire
now
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
"
be
to
know
you
and
the
dear
girl
,
 
and
to
be
love
by
you
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
as
soon
as
she
be
alone
in
the
room
,
stand
in
the
middle
of
it
,
scowling
,
 
for
she
could
scowl
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
go
near
them
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
 
"
nasty
,
stupid
,
dull
,
puritanical
drone
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
not
like
it
,
he
may
lump
it
.
<EOS>
after
all
it
be
no
such
great
catch
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
sit
down
to
reflect
whether
it
be
or
be
not
a
catch
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
ever
Lord
Fawn
have
leave
her
after
the
engagement
be
make
,
she
have
begin
to
tell
herself
that
he
be
a
poor
creature
,
and
that
she
have
do
wrong
.
"
<EOS>
only
five
thousand
a
year
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
to
herself
;
 
for
she
have
not
perfectly
understand
that
little
explanation
which
he
have
give
respect
his
income
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
nothing
for
a
lord
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
again
she
murmur
to
herself
,
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
money
<EOS>
he
be
after
.
<EOS>
He
will
find
out
that
I
know
how
to
keep
what
I
have
get
in
my
own
hand
.
"
<EOS>
now
that
Lady
Fawn
have
be
cold
to
her
,
she
think
still
less
of
the
propose
marriage
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
this
inducement
for
her
to
go
on
with
it
.
<EOS>
if
they
,
the
Fawn
woman
,
think
that
they
could
break
it
off
,
she
would
let
them
know
that
they
have
no
such
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
mamma
,
you
have
see
her
?
"
say
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
;
I
have
see
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
her
two
or
three
time
before
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
be
still
in
love
with
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
say
that
I
be
in
love
with
her
,
Clara
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
have
be
fix
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
to
come
down
to
Fawn
Court
next
week
,
and
stay
a
fortnight
with
us
.
<EOS>
then
we
shall
find
out
what
she
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
will
be
good
,
mamma
,
"
say
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
mind
,
mamma
<EOS>
;
you
understand
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
Frederic
plainly
just
what
I
think
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
will
be
offend
,
and
if
the
marriage
go
on
,
the
offence
will
remain
,
 
till
he
find
out
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
will
find
out
no
such
truth
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
however
,
quite
unable
to
say
a
word
in
behalf
of
her
future
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
She
say
nothing
as
to
that
little
scene
with
the
Bible
,
but
she
never
forget
it
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
and
Her
Lover
 
<EOS>
during
the
remainder
of
that
Monday
and
all
the
Tuesday
,
Lizzie
's
mind
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
averse
to
matrimony
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
Miss
Macnulty
of
her
prospect
,
with
some
amount
of
exultation
;
and
the
poor
dependant
,
though
she
know
that
she
must
be
turn
out
into
the
street
,
have
congratulate
her
patroness
.
"
<EOS>
the
Vulturess
will
take
you
in
again
,
when
she
know
you
have
nowhere
else
to
go
,
"
Lizzie
have
say
,
 
displaying
,
indeed
,
some
accurate
discernment
of
her
aunt
's
character
.
<EOS>
but
after
Lady
Fawn
's
visit
she
speak
of
the
marriage
in
a
different
tone
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
have
to
look
very
close
after
the
settlement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
lawyer
will
do
that
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
lawyer
!
<EOS>
that
be
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
lawyer
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
trust
any
lawyer
to
give
away
my
property
.
<EOS>
of
course
we
shall
live
at
Portray
,
because
his
place
be
in
Ireland
;
 
and
nothing
shall
take
me
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
from
the
very
first
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
mean
to
give
up
my
own
income
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
he
will
venture
to
suggest
such
a
thing
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
again
she
grumble
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
very
well
be
in
the
Cabinet
 
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
Lord
Fawn
in
the
Cabinet
?
"
ask
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
in
such
matter
be
not
altogether
ignorant
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
be
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
with
an
angry
gesture
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
unjust
to
accuse
her
of
be
stupidly
unacquainted
with
circumstance
,
and
a
liar
at
the
same
time
;
but
she
be
both
.
<EOS>
She
say
that
Lord
Fawn
be
in
the
Cabinet
because
she
have
hear
some
one
speak
of
him
as
not
be
a
Cabinet
Minister
,
and
in
so
speak
appear
to
slight
his
political
position
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
do
not
know
how
much
her
companion
know
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
do
not
comprehend
the
depth
of
the
ignorance
of
her
patroness
.
<EOS>
thus
the
lie
which
Lizzie
tell
be
amazing
to
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
to
say
that
Lord
Fawn
be
in
the
Cabinet
,
when
all
the
world
know
that
he
be
an
Under
-
Secretary
!
<EOS>
what
good
could
a
woman
get
from
an
assertion
so
plainly
,
so
manifestly
false
?
<EOS>
but
Lizzie
know
nothing
of
Under
-
Secretaries
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
a
lord
,
and
even
commoner
be
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
be
,
"
say
Lizzie
;
"
but
I
sha'n't
have
my
drawing
-
room
make
a
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
They
sha'n't
come
here
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
again
on
the
Tuesday
evening
she
display
her
independence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
for
those
woman
down
at
Richmond
,
I
do
not
mean
to
be
overrun
by
them
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
say
I
would
go
there
,
and
of
course
I
shall
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
have
better
go
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
I
shall
go
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
anybody
to
tell
me
where
I
be
to
go
,
my
dear
,
and
where
I
be
not
.
<EOS>
but
it
will
be
about
the
first
and
the
last
visit
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
bring
those
dowdy
girl
out
in
London
,
it
be
the
last
thing
I
shall
think
of
do
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
doubt
whether
they
can
afford
to
dress
themselves
.
"
<EOS>
as
she
go
up
to
bed
on
the
Tuesday
evening
,
Miss
Macnulty
doubt
whether
the
match
would
go
on
.
<EOS>
She
never
believe
her
friend
's
statement
;
but
if
spoken
word
may
be
suppose
to
mean
anything
,
Lady
Eustace
's
word
on
that
Tuesday
betoken
a
strong
dislike
to
everything
appertain
to
the
Fawn
family
.
<EOS>
She
have
even
ridicule
Lord
Fawn
himself
,
declare
that
he
understand
nothing
about
anything
beyond
his
office
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
in
truth
,
Lizzie
almost
have
make
up
her
mind
to
break
it
off
.
<EOS>
all
that
she
would
gain
do
not
seem
to
weigh
down
with
sufficient
preponderance
all
that
she
would
lose
.
<EOS>
such
be
her
feeling
on
the
Tuesday
night
.
<EOS>
but
on
the
Wednesday
morning
she
receive
a

:
"
Messrs.

and
Son

their
compliment

They

receive
instruction
to
proceed
by
law
for
the
recovery
of
the
Eustace

"
the
effect
of
this
note
be
to
drive
Lizzie
back
upon
the
Fawn
interest
.
<EOS>
She
be
frightened
about
the
diamond
,
and
be
,
nevertheless
,
almost
determined
not
to
surrender
them
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
in
such
a
strait
she
would
want
assistance
,
either
in
keep
them
or
in
give
them
up
.
<EOS>
the
lawyer
's
letter
afflict
her
with
a
sense
of
weakness
,
and
there
be
strength
in
the
Fawn
connexion
.
<EOS>
as
Lord
Fawn
be
so
poor
,
perhaps
he
would
adhere
to
the
jewel
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
could
not
fight
Mr.
Camperdown
with
no
other
assistance
than
what
Messrs.
Mowbray
and
Mopus
may
give
her
,
and
therefore
her
heart
soften
towards
her
betroth
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Frederic
will
be
here
to
-
day
,
"
she
say
to
Miss
Macnulty
,
as
they
sit
at
breakfast
together
about
noon
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
nod
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
a
cab
,
you
know
,
if
you
like
to
go
anywhere
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
say
she
think
she
would
go
to
the
National
Gallery
.
"
<EOS>
and
you
can
walk
back
,
you
know
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
walk
there
and
back
too
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
,
 
in
regard
to
whom
it
may
be
say
that
the
last
ounce
would
sometimes
almost
break
the
horse
's
back

<EOS>
"
Frederic

come
and
be
receive
very
graciously
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
place
Mr.
Camperdown
's
note
on
the
little
table
behind
her
,
beneath
the
Bible
,
so
that
she
may
put
her
hand
upon
it
at
once
,
if
she
could
make
an
opportunity
of
show
it
to
her
future
husband
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frederic
"
sit
himself
beside
her
,
and
the
intercourse
for
awhile
be
<EOS>
such
as
may
be
look
for
between
two
lover
of
whom
one
be
a
widow
,
and
the
other
an
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
from
the
India
Office
.
<EOS>
They
be
love
,
but
discreetly
amatory
,
talk
chiefly
of
thing
material
,
each
flattering
the
other
,
and
each
hinting
now
and
again
at
certain
little
circumstance
of
which
a
more
accurate
knowledge
seem
to
be
desirable
.
<EOS>
the
one
be
conversant
with
thing
in
general
,
but
be
slow
;
the
other
be
quick
as
a
lizard
in
turn
hither
and
thither
,
but
know
almost
nothing
.
<EOS>
when
she
tell
Lord
Fawn
that
the
Ayrshire
estate
be
"
her
own
,
to
do
what
she
like
with
,
"
she
do
not
know
that
he
would
certainly
find
out
the
truth
from
other
source
before
he
marry
her
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
be
not
quite
sure
herself
whether
the
statement
be
true
or
false
,
though
she
would
not
have
make
it
so
frequently
have
her
idea
of
the
truth
be
a
fix
idea
.
<EOS>
It
have
all
be
explain
to
her
;
 
but
there
have
be
something
about
a
second
son
,
and
there
be
no
second
son
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
may
have
a
second
son
yet
,
 
a
future
little
Lord
Fawn
,
and
he
may
inherit
it
.
<EOS>
in
regard
to
honesty
,
the
man
be
superior
to
the
woman
,
because
his
purpose
be
declare
,
and
he
tell
no
lie
;
 
but
the
one
be
as
mercenary
as
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
love
that
have
bring
Lord
Fawn
to
Mount
Street
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
name
of
your
place
in
Ireland
?

"
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
house

you
know

there
be
one

<EOS>
"
the

<EOS>
"

pretty
name

<EOS>
and
 
and
 
do
it
go
a
great
many
mile

"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
explain
that
it
do
run
a
good
many
mile
up
into
the
mountain
.
"
<EOS>
how
beautifully
romantic
!
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
but
the
people
live
on
the
mountain
and
pay
rent
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
ask
no
such
inept
question
respect
the
Ayrshire
property
,
but
he
do
inquire
who
be
Lizzie
's
solicitor
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
there
will
be
thing
to
be
settle
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
my
lawyer
have
better
see
yours
.
<EOS>
Mr.

be
a

"
Mr.
Camperdown
!
<EOS>
"
almost
shriek
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
then
explain
,
with
some
amazement
,
that
Mr.
Camperdown
be
his
lawyer
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
his
belief
go
,
there
be
not
a
more
respectable
gentleman
in
the
profession
.
<EOS>
then
he
inquire
whether
Lizzie
have
any
objection
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
be
Sir
Florian
's
lawyer
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
will
make
it
all
the
easy
,
I
should
think
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
that
may
be
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
try
to
bring
her
mind
to
work
upon
the
subject
steadily
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
have
be
very
uncourteous
to
me
;
 
I
must
say
that
;
and
,
as
I
think
,
unfair
.
<EOS>
He
wish
to
rob
me
now
of
a
thing
that
be
quite
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
sort
of
a
thing
?
"
ask
Lord
Fawn
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
valuable
thing
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
all
about
it
,
Frederic
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
will
tell
you
everything
now
.
<EOS>
I
never
could
keep
back
anything
from
one
that
I
love
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
nature
.
<EOS>
there
;
you
may
as
well
read
that
note
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
put
her
hand
back
and
bring
Mr.
Camperdown
's
letter
from
under
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
read
it
very
attentively
,
and
as
he
read
it
there
come
upon
him
a
great
doubt
.
<EOS>
what
sort
of
woman
be
this
to
whom
he
have
engage
himself
because
she
be
possess
of
an
income
?
<EOS>
that
Mr.
Camperdown
should
be
in
the
wrong
in
such
a
matter
be
an
idea
which
never
occur
to
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
form
of
belief
strong
than
that
which
the
ordinary
english
gentleman
have
in
the
discretion
and
honesty
of
his
own
family
lawyer
.
<EOS>
what
his
lawyer
tell
him
to
do
,
he
do
.
<EOS>
what
his
lawyer
tell
him
to
sign
,
he
sign
.
<EOS>
He
buy
and
sell
in
obedience
to
the
same
direction
,
and
feel
perfectly
comfortable
in
the
possession
of
a
guide
who
be
responsible
and
all
but
divine
.
<EOS>
"
what
diamond
be
they
?
"
ask
Lord
Fawn
in
a
very
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
my
own
,
 
altogether
my
own
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
give
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
when
he
put
them
into
my
hand
,
he
say
that
they
be
to
be
my
own
for
ever
and
ever
.
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
say
he
,
 
"
those
be
yours
to
do
what
you
choose
with
them
.
"
<EOS>
after
that
they
ought
not
to
ask
me
to
give
them
back
,
 
ought
they
?
<EOS>
if
you
have
be
marry
before
,
and
your
wife
have
give
you
a
keepsake
,
 
to
keep
for
ever
and
ever
,
would
you
give
it
up
to
a
lawyer
?
<EOS>
You
would
not
like
it
;
 
would
you
,
Frederic
?
"
<EOS>
She
have
put
her
hand
on
his
,
and
be
look
up
into
his
face
as
she
ask
the
question
.
<EOS>
again
,
perhaps
,
the
acting
be
a
little
overdone
;
but
there
be
the
tear
in
her
eye
,
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
be
perfect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Camperdown
call
them
Eustace
diamond
,
 
family
diamond
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
they
consist
of
?
<EOS>
what
be
they
worth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
show
them
to
you
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
jump
up
and
hurry
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
when
he
be
alone
,
rub
his
hand
over
his
eye
and
think
about
it
all
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
very
harsh
measure
,
on
the
part
of
the
Eustace
family
and
of
Mr.
Camperdown
,
to
demand
from
her
the
surrender
of
any
trinket
which
her
late
husband
may
have
give
her
in
the
manner
she
have
describe
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
,
to
his
thinking
,
most
improbable
that
the
eustace
people
or
the
lawyer
should
be
harsh
to
a
widow
bear
the
Eustace
name
.
<EOS>
the
Eustaces
be
by
disposition
lavish
,
and
old
Mr.
Camperdown
be
not
one
who
would
be
strict
in
claim
little
thing
for
rich
client
.
<EOS>
and
yet
here
be
his
letter
,
threaten
the
widow
of
the
late
baronet
with
legal
proceeding
for
the
recovery
of
jewel
which
have
be
give
by
Sir
Florian
himself
to
his
wife
as
a
keepsake
!
<EOS>
perhaps
Sir
Florian
have
make
some
mistake
,
and
have
cause
to
be
set
in
a
ring
or
brooch
for
his
bride
some
jewel
which
he
have
think
to
be
his
own
,
but
which
have
,
in
truth
,
be
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
the
jewel
should
,
of
course
,
be
surrender
,
 
or
replace
by
one
of
equal
value
.
<EOS>
He
be
make
out
some
such
solution
,
when
Lizzie
return
with
the
morocco
case
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
manner
in
which
he
give
it
to
me
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
as
she
open
the
clasp
,
"
which
make
its
value
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
know
nothing
about
jewel
,
but
even
he
know
that
if
the
circle
of
stone
which
he
see
,
with
a
maltese
cross
append
to
it
,
be
constitute
of
real
diamond
,
the
thing
must
be
of
great
value
.
<EOS>
and
it
occur
to
him
at
once
that
such
a
necklace
be
not
give
by
a
husband
even
to
a
bride
in
the
manner
describe
by
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
a
ring
,
or
brooch
,
or
perhaps
a
bracelet
,
a
lover
or
a
love
lord
may
bring
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
but
such
an
ornament
as
this
on
which
Lord
Fawn
be
now
look
,
be
give
in
another
sort
of
way
.
<EOS>
He
feel
sure
that
it
be
so
,
even
though
he
be
entirely
ignorant
of
the
value
of
the
stone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
what
it
be
worth
?
"
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
hesitate
a
moment
,
and
then
remember
that
"
Frederic
,
"
in
his
present
position
in
regard
to
herself
,
may
be
glad
to
assist
her
in
maintain
the
possession
of
a
substantial
property
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
say
its
value
be
about
 
ten
thousand
pound
,
"
she
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
ten
 
thousand
 
pound
!
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
rivet
his
eye
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
I
be
tell
 
by
a
jeweller
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
by
what
jeweller
?
"
  
"
a
man
have
to
come
and
see
them
,
 
about
some
repair
,
 
or
something
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
poor
Sir
Florian
wish
it
.
<EOS>
and
he
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
man
's
name
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
forget
his
name
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
who
be
not
quite
sure
whether
her
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Benjamin
would
be
consider
respectable
.
  
<EOS>
"
ten
thousand
pound
!
<EOS>
You
do
not
keep
them
in
the
house
;
 
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
iron
case
up
-
stair
for
them
;
 
ever
so
heavy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
Sir
Florian
give
you
the
iron
case
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
hesitate
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
is
,
 
no
.
<EOS>
but
he
order
it
to
be
make
;
and
then
it
come
,
 
after
he
be
 
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
know
their
value
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
,
yes
.
<EOS>
though
he
never
name
any
sum
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
however
,
that
they
be
very
 
very
valuable
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
do
not
immediately
recognise
the
falseness
of
every
word
that
the
woman
say
to
him
,
because
he
be
slow
and
could
not
think
and
hear
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
at
once
involve
in
a
painful
maze
of
doubt
and
almost
of
dismay
.
<EOS>
an
action
for
the
recovery
of
jewel
bring
against
the
lady
whom
he
be
engage
to
marry
,
on
behalf
of
the
family
of
her
late
husband
,
would
not
suit
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
to
have
his
hand
quite
clean
,
to
be
above
all
evil
report
,
to
be
respectable
,
as
it
be
,
all
round
,
be
Lord
Fawn
's
special
ambition
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
poor
man
,
and
a
greedy
man
,
but
he
would
have
abandon
his
official
salary
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
rather
than
there
should
have
fall
on
him
a
breath
of
public
opinion
hint
that
it
ought
to
be
abandon
.
<EOS>
He
be
especially
timid
,
and
live
in
a
perpetual
fear
lest
the
newspaper
should
say
something
hard
of
him
.
<EOS>
in
that
matter
of
the
Sawab
he
have
be
very
wretched
,
because
Frank
Greystock
have
accuse
him
of
be
an
administrator
of
tyranny
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
like
his
wife
to
have
ten
thousand
pound
"
worth
of
diamond
very
well
;
but
he
would
rather
go
without
a
wife
for
ever
,
 
and
without
a
wife
's
fortune
,
 
than
marry
a
woman
subject
to
an
action
for
claim
diamond
not
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
say
he
,
at
last
,
"
that
if
you
be
to
put
them
into
Mr.
Camperdown

do
not

<EOS>
Frederic
's
face
have
become
very
long

he
be
much
disturb
in
his
mind

<EOS>
He
could
only
suggest
that
he
himself
would
go
and
see
Mr.

ascertain
what
ought

do

<EOS>
to

adhere
to
his
assurance

Mr.

could
do
no

Lizzie
,
in
her
wrath
,
ask
him
whether
he
believe
Mr.

's
word
before
hers

<EOS>

I

He

<EOS>
when
Lord

take
his
leave

he
do
not
do
till
he
have
counsel
her
again
and
again
to
leave
the
matter
in
Mr.
Camperdown
's
hand
,
 
the
two
be
not
in
good
accord
together
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
fix
purpose
,
as
he
declare
to
her
,
to
see
Mr.
Camperdown
;
and
it
be
her
fix
purpose
,
 
so
<EOS>
,
at
least
,
she
declare
to
him
,
 
to
keep
the
diamond
,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Camperdown

"
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
,
if
it

decide
against
you

Lord
Fawn
gravely

<EOS>
"
It
can
not

decide
against

you
ought

do

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
nothing
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
in
a
tremor
.
<EOS>
then
Lizzie
look
at
him
,
 
and
her
look
,
which
be
very
eloquent
,
call
him
a
poltroon
as
plain
as
a
look
could
speak
.
<EOS>
then
they
part
,
and
the
sign
of
affection
between
them
be
not
satisfactory
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
be
hardly
close
behind
him
before
Lizzie
begin
to
declare
to
herself
that
he
should
not
escape
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
yet
twenty
-
four
hour
since
she
have
be
tell
herself
that
she
do
not
like
the
engagement
and
would
break
it
off
;
and
now
she
be
stamp
her
little
foot
,
and
clench
her
little
hand
,
and
swear
to
herself
by
all
her
god
,
that
this
wretche
,
timid
lordling
should
not
get
out
of
her
net
.
<EOS>
She
do
,
in
truth
,
despise
him
because
he
would
not
clutch
the
jewel
.
<EOS>
She
look
upon
him
as
mean
and
paltry
because
he
be
willing
to
submit
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
but
still
she
be
prompt
to
demand
all
that
could
be
demand
from
her
engagement
,
 
because
she
think
that
she
perceive
a
something
in
him
which
may
produce
in
him
a
desire
to
be
relieve
from
it
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
he
should
not
be
relieve
.
<EOS>
He
should
marry
her
.
<EOS>
and
she
would
keep
the
key
of
that
iron
box
with
the
diamond
,
and
he
should
find
what
sort
of
a
noise
she
would
make
if
he
attempt
to
take
it
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
close
the
morocco
case
,
ascend
with
it
to
her
bed
-
room
,
lock
it
up
in
the
iron
safe
,
deposit
the
little
patent
key
in
its
usual
place
round
her
neck
,
and
then
seat
herself
at
her
desk
,
and
write
letter
to
her
various
friend
,
make
know
to
them
her
engagement
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
she
have
tell
no
one
but
Miss
Macnulty
,
 
and
,
in
her
doubt
,
have
go
so
far
as
to
desire
Miss
Macnulty
not
to
mention
it
.
<EOS>
now
she
be
resolve
to
blazon
forth
her
engagement
before
all
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
"
friend
"
to
whom
she
write
be
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
the
reader
shall
see
two
or
three
of
her
letter
,
and
that
to
the
countess
shall
be
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
aunt
,
  
<EOS>
when
you
come
to
see
me
the
other
day
,
I
can
not
say
that
you
be
very
kind
to
me
,
and
I
do
not
suppose
you
care
very
much
what
become
of
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
right
to
let
you
know
that
I
be
go
to
be
marry
.
<EOS>
I
be
engage
to
Lord
Fawn
,
who
,
as
you
know
,
be
a
peer
,
and
a
member
of
Her
Majesty
's
government
,
and
a
nobleman
of
great
influence
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
that
even
you
can
say
anything
against
such
an
alliance
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
,
your
affectionate
niece
,
  
ELI
.
<EOS>
EUSTACE
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
write
to
Mrs.
Eustace
,
the
wife
of
the
Bishop
of
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Eustace
have
be
very
kind
to
her
in
the
first
day
of
her
widowhood
,
and
have
fully
recognise
her
as
the
widow
of
the
head
of
her
husband
's
family
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
like
none
of
the
bobsborough
people
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
accord
to
her
idea
,
slow
,
respectable
,
and
dull
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
not
find
much
open
fault
with
her
,
and
she
be
aware
that
it
be
for
her
interest
to
remain
on
good
term
with
them
.
<EOS>
Her
letter
,
therefore
,
to
Mrs.
Eustace
be
somewhat
less
acrid
than
that
write
to
her
aunt
Linlithgow
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
MRS
.
<EOS>
EUSTACE
,
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
from
me
,
and
will
not
be
sorry
to
hear
my
news
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
be
marry
again
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
not
about
to
take
a
step
which
be
in
every
way
so
very
important
without
think
about
it
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
sure
it
will
be
well
for
my
darling
little
Florian
in
every
way
;
and
as
for
myself
,
I
have
feel
for
the
last
two
year
how
unfitted
I
have
be
to
manage
everything
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
accept
an
offer
make
to
me
by
Lord
Fawn
,
who
be
,
as
you
know
,
a
peer
of
Parliament
,
and
a
most
distinguished
member
of
Her
Majesty
's
government
;
and
he
be
,
too
,
a
nobleman
of
very
great
influence
in
every
respect
,
and
have
a
property
in
Ireland
,
extend
over
ever
so
many
mile
,
and
run
up
into
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
His
mansion
there
be
call
Killmage
,
but
I
be
not
sure
that
I
remember
the
name
quite
rightly
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
see
you
there
some
day
,
and
the
dear
bishop
.
<EOS>
I
look
forward
with
delight
to
do
something
to
make
those
dear
irish
happier
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
ramble
up
into
our
own
mountain
charm
me
,
for
nothing
suit
my
disposition
so
well
as
that
kind
of
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
Lord
Fawn
be
not
so
rich
a
man
as
Sir
Florian
,
but
I
have
never
look
to
rich
for
my
happiness
.
<EOS>
not
but
what
Lord
Fawn
have
a
good
income
from
his
irish
estate
;
and
then
,
of
course
,
he
be
pay
for
do
Her
Majesty
's
Government
;
 
<EOS>
so
there
be
no
fear
that
he
will
have
to
live
upon
my
jointure
,
which
,
of
course
,
would
not
be
right
.
<EOS>
pray
tell
the
dear
bishop
and
dear
Margaretta
all
this
,
with
my
love
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
happy
,
I
know
,
to
hear
that
my
little
Flo
be
quite
well
.
<EOS>
He
be
already
so
fond
of
his
new
papa
!
<EOS>
[
Lizzie
's
turn
for
lying
be
exemplify
in
this
last
statement
,
for
,
as
it
happen
,
Lord
Fawn
have
never
yet
see
the
child
.
]
  
<EOS>
believe
me
to
be
always
your
most
affectionate
niece
,
  
ELI
.
<EOS>
EUSTACE
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
other
letter
,
 
one
to
her
uncle
,
the
dean
,
and
the
other
to
her
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
there
be
great
doubt
in
her
mind
as
to
the
expediency
of
write
to
Frank
Greystock
;
but
at
last
she
decide
that
she
would
do
it
.
<EOS>
the
letter
to
the
dean
nee
not
be
give
in
full
,
as
it
be
very
similar
to
that
write
to
the
bishop
's
wife
.
<EOS>
the
same
mention
be
make
of
her
intend
husband
's
peerage
,
and
the
same
allusion
to
Her
Majesty
's
Government
,
 
a
phrase
which
she
have
hear
from
Lord
Fawn
himself
.
<EOS>
She
speak
of
the
irish
property
,
but
in
term
less
glowing
than
she
have
use
in
write
to
the
lady
,
and
end
by
ask
for
her
uncle
's
congratulation
 
and
blessing
.
<EOS>
Her
letter
to
Frank
be
as
follow
,
and
,
doubtless
,
as
she
write
it
,
there
be
present
to
her
mind
<EOS>
a
remembrance
of
the
fact
that
he
himself
may
have
offer
to
her
,
and
have
have
her
if
he
would
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
cousin
,
  
<EOS>
as
I
would
rather
that
you
should
hear
my
news
from
myself
than
from
any
one
else
,
I
write
to
tell
you
that
I
be
go
to
be
married
to
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
know
that
there
be
certain
matter
as
to
which
you
and
Lord
Fawn
do
not
agree
,
 
in
politic
,
I
mean
;
but
still
I
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
you
will
think
that
he
be
quite
able
to
take
care
of
your
poor
little
cousin
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
settle
a
day
or
two
since
,
but
it
have
be
come
on
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
You
understand
all
about
that
;
 
do
not
you
?
<EOS>
of
course
you
must
come
to
my
wedding
,
and
be
very
good
to
me
,
 
a
kind
of
brother
,
you
know
;
for
we
have
always
be
friend
;
 
have
not
we
?
<EOS>
and
if
the
dean
do
not
come
up
to
town
,
you
must
give
me
away
.
<EOS>
and
you
must
come
and
see
me
ever
so
often
;
for
I
have
a
sort
of
feeling
that
I
have
no
one
else
belong
to
me
that
I
can
call
really
my
own
,
except
you
.
<EOS>
and
you
must
be
great
friend
with
Lord
Fawn
,
and
must
give
up
say
that
he
do
not
do
his
work
properly
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
do
everything
well
than
<EOS>
anybody
else
could
possibly
do
it
,
 
except
Cousin
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
go
down
next
week
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
insist
on
my
staying
there
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
,
what
shall
I
do
all
the
time
?
<EOS>
You
must
positively
come
down
and
see
me
,
 
and
see
somebody
else
too
!
<EOS>
only
,
you
naughty
coz
!
<EOS>
you
must
not
break
a
poor
girl
's
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
cousin
,
  
ELI
.
<EOS>
eustace
.
  
<EOS>
somebody
,
in
speak
on
Lady
Eustace
's
behalf
,
and
make
the
good
of
her
virtue
,
have
declare
that
she
do
not
have
lover
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
that
have
be
true
of
her
;
 
but
her
mind
have
not
the
less
dwelt
on
the
delight
of
a
lover
.
<EOS>
She
still
think
of
a
possible
Corsair
who
would
be
willing
to
give
up
all
but
his
vice
for
her
love
,
and
for
whose
sake
she
would
be
willing
to
share
even
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
dream
,
but
nevertheless
it
pervade
her
fancy
constantly
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
 
peer
of
Parliament
,
and
member
of
Her
Majesty
's
Government
,
as
he
be
,
 
could
not
have
be
such
a
lover
to
her
.
<EOS>
may
it
not
be
possible
that
there
should
exist
something
of
romance
between
her
and
her
cousin
Frank
?
<EOS>
She
be
the
last
woman
in
the
world
to
run
away
with
a
man
,
or
to
endanger
her
position
by
a
serious
indiscretion
;
but
there
may
,
perhaps
,
be
a
something
between
her
and
her
cousin
,
 
a
liaison
quite
correct
in
its
fact
,
a
secret
understanding
,
if
nothing
more
,
 
a
mutual
sympathy
,
which
should
be
chiefly
show
in
the
abuse
of
all
their
friend
,
 
and
in
this
she
could
indulge
her
passion
for
romance
and
poetry
.
   
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
at
His
office
 
<EOS>
the
news
be
soon
all
about
London
,
 
as
Lizzie

.
<EOS>
She
have
make
a
sudden
resolve
that
Lord
Fawn
should
not
escape
her
,
and
she
have
go
to
work
after
the
fashion
we
have
see
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
have
tell
John
Eustace
,
and
John
Eustace
have
tell
Mr.
Camperdown
before
Lord
Fawn
himself
,
in
the
slow
prosecution
of
his
purpose
,
have
consult
the
lawyer
about
the
necklace
.
"
<EOS>
God
bless
my
soul
;
 
Lord
Fawn
!
"
<EOS>
the
old
lawyer
have
say
when
the
news
be
communicate
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
 
yes
;
 
he
want
money
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
envy
him
;
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
We
shall
get
the
diamond
now
,
John
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
not
the
man
to
let
his
wife
keep
what
do
not
belong
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
after
a
day
or
two
,
Lord
Fawn
have
himself
go
to
Mr.
Camperdown
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
be
to
congratulate
you
,
my
lord
,
"
say
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
you
be
go
to
marry
 
;
well
,
I
must
not
really
say
another
of
my
client
,
but
the
widow
of
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
be
a
very
beautiful
woman
,
and
she
have
a
very
pretty
income
too
.
<EOS>
She
have
the
whole
of
the
Scotch
property
for
her
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
for
her
life
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
no
;
 
of
course
not
.
<EOS>
there
be
be
some
mistake
on
her
part
;
 
at
least
,
so
I
have
be
tell
.
<EOS>
woman
never
understand
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
as
clear
as
daylight
.
<EOS>
have
there
be
a
second
son
,
the
second
son
would
have
have
it
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
it
go
with
the
rest
of
the
property
 
just
as
it
ought
to
do
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
four
thousand
a
year
be
not
so
bad
,
you
know
,
consider
that
she
be
not
more
than
a
girl
yet
,
and
that
she
have
not
sixpence
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
when
the
admiral
die
,
there
be
not
sixpence
,
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
have
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
sixpence
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
eustace
money
.
<EOS>
She
have
six
or
eight
thousand
pound
,
or
something
like
that
,
besides
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
lovely
a
young
widow
as
I
ever
see
,
 
and
very
clever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
she
be
clever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
-
the
-
bye
,
Lord
Fawn
,
as
you
have
do
me
the
honour
of
calling
,
 
there
be
a
stupid
mistake
about
some
family
diamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
in
respect
to
them
that
I
have
come
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Camperdown
,
in
his
easy
,
off
-
hand
way
,
impute
no
blame
to
the
lady
in
the
hearing
of
her
future
husband
,
and
declare
his
opinion
that
she
be
doubtless
unaware
of
its
value
,
explain
the
matter
of
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
listen
,
but
say
very
little
.
<EOS>
He
especially
do
not
say
that
Lady
Eustace
have
have
the
stone
value
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
real
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
he
ask
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
assure
him
that
no
diamond
more
real
have
ever
come
from
Golconda
,
or
pass
through
Mr.
Garnett
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
as
well
know
as
any
family
diamond
in
England
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
get
into
bad
hand
,
"
 
continue
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
Mowbray
and
Mopus
;
 
horrible
people
;
shark
,
that
make
one
blush
for
one
's
profession
;
and
I
be
really
afraid
there
would
have
be
trouble
.
<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
it
will
be
all
right
now
;
 
and
if
she
will
only
come
to
me
,
tell
her
I
will
do
everything
I
can
to
make
thing
straight
and
comfortable
for
her
.
<EOS>
if
she
like
to
have
another
lawyer
,
of
course
,
that
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
only
make
her
understand
who
Mowbray
and
Mopus
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
out
of
the
question
,
Lord
Fawn
,
that
your
wife
should
have
anything
to
do
with
Mowbray
and
Mopus
.
<EOS>
"
every
word
that
Mr.
Camperdown
say
be
gospel
to
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
as
the
reader
will
understand
,
Mr.
Camperdown
have
by
no
mean
express
his
real
opinion
in
this
interview
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
of
the
widow
in
friendly
term
,
 
declare
that
she
be
simply
mistake
in
her
idea
as
to
the
duration
of
her
interest
in
the
Scotch
property
,
and
mistake
again
about
the
diamond
;
 
whereas
in
truth
he
regard
her
as
a
dishonest
,
lying
,
evil
-
minded
harpy
.
<EOS>
have
Lord
Fawn
consult
him
simply
as
a
client
,
and
not
have
come
to
him
an
engaged
lover
,
he
would
have
express
his
opinion
quite
frankly
;
but
it
be
not
the
business
of
a
lawyer
to
tell
his
client
evil
thing
of
the
lady
whom
that
client
be
engage
to
marry
.
<EOS>
in
regard
to
the
property
he
speak
the
truth
,
and
he
speak
what
he
believe
to
be
the
truth
when
he
say
that
the
whole
thing
would
no
doubt
now
be
easily
arrange
.
<EOS>
when
Lord
Fawn
take
his
leave
,
Mr.
Camperdown
again
declare
to
himself
that
as
regard
money
the
match
be
very
well
for
his
lordship
;
but
that
,
as
regard
the
woman
,
Lizzie
be
dear
at
the
price
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
do
not
mind
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
to
himself
,
"
but
I
would
not
marry
such
a
woman
myself
,
though
she
own
all
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
much
in
the
interview
to
make
Lord
Fawn
unhappy
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
that
golden
hope
as
to
the
perpetuity
of
the
property
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
believe
that
it
be
so
;
but
a
man
may
hope
without
believe
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
quite
sure
that
Lizzie
be
bind
to
give
up
the
diamond
,
 
and
would
ultimately
be
make
to
give
them
up
.
<EOS>
of
any
property
in
them
,
as
possibly
accrue
to
himself
,
he
have
not
think
much
;
 
but
he
could
not
abstain
from
think
of
the
woman
's
grasp
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
's
plain
statement
,
which
be
gospel
to
him
,
be
directly
at
variance
with
Lizzie
's
story
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
certainly
would
not
have
give
such
diamond
in
such
a
way
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
would
not
have
order
a
separate
iron
safe
for
them
,
with
a
view
that
they
may
be
secure
in
his
wife
's
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
have
have
them
value
,
and
manifestly
be
always
think
of
her
treasure
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
well
for
a
poor
,
careful
peer
to
be
always
think
of
his
money
,
but
Lord
Fawn
be
well
aware
that
a
young
woman
such
as
Lady
Eustace
should
have
her
thought
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
as
he
sit
sign
letter
at
the
India
Board
,
relieve
himself
when
he
be
leave
alone
between
each
batch
by
stand
up
with
his
back
to
the
fire
-
place
,
his
mind
be
full
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
unravel
truth
quickly
,
but
he
could
grasp
it
when
it
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
certainly
greedy
,
false
,
and
dishonest
.
<EOS>
and
,
 
bad
than
all
this
,
 
she
have
dare
to
tell
him
to
his
face
that
he
be
a
poor
creature
because
he
would
not
support
her
in
her
greed
,
and
falsehood
,
and
dishonesty
!
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
be
engage
to
marry
her
!
<EOS>
then
he
think
of
one
Violet
Effingham
whom
he
have
love
,
and
then
come
over
him
some
suspicion
of
a
fear
that
he
himself
be
hard
and
selfish
.
<EOS>
and
yet
what
be
such
a
one
as
he
to
do
?
<EOS>
It
be
of
course
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
the
very
constitution
of
his
country
that
there
should
be
future
Lord
Fawns
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
future
Lord
Fawns
unless
he
marry
;
 
and
how
could
he
marry
without
money
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
peasant
can
marry
whom
he
please
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
press
his
hand
to
his
brow
,
and
drop
one
flap
of
his
coat
,
as
he
think
of
his
own
high
and
perilous
destiny
,
stand
with
his
back
to
the
fire
-
place
,
while
a
huge
pile
of
letter
lie
there
before
him
wait
to
be
sign
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
Saturday
evening
,
and
as
there
be
no
House
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
hurry
him
away
from
the
office
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
occupier
for
the
time
of
a
large
,
well
-
furnish
official
room
,
look
out
into
St.
James
's
Park
,
and
as
he
glance
round
it
he
tell
himself
that
his
own
happiness
must
be
there
,
and
not
in
the
domesticity
of
a
quiet
home
.
<EOS>
the
House
of
Lords
,
out
of
which
nobody
could
turn
him
,
and
official
life
,
 
as
long
as
he
could
hold
to
it
,
 
must
be
all
in
all
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
engage
himself
to
this
woman
,
and
he
must
 
marry
her
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
think
that
he
could
now
see
any
way
of
avoid
that
event
.
<EOS>
Her
income
would
supply
the
need
of
her
home
,
and
then
there
may
probably
be
a
continuation
of
Lord
Fawns
.
<EOS>
the
world
may
have
do
better
for
him
,
 
have
he
be
able
to
find
favour
in
Violet
Effingham
's
sight
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
capable
of
love
,
 
and
very
capable
of
constancy
to
a
woman
true
to
him
.
<EOS>
then
he
wipe
away
a
tear
as
he
sit
down
to
sign
the
huge
batch
of
letter
.
<EOS>
as
he
read
some
special
letter
in
which
instruction
be
convey
as
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
Sawab
's
claim
,
he
think
of
Frank
Greystock
's
attack
upon
him
,
and
of
Frank
Greystock
's
cousin
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
time
in
which
he
have
fear
that
the
two
cousin
would
become
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
he
utter
a
malediction
against
the
member
for
Bobsborough
,
which
may
perhaps
have
be
spare
have
the
member
be
now
willing
to
take
the
lady
off
his
hand
.
<EOS>
then
the
door
be
open
,
and
the
messenger
tell
him
that
Mrs.
Hittaway
be
in
the
waiting
-
room
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
be
,
of
course
,
at
once
make
welcome
to
the
Under
-
Secretary
's
own
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
be
a
strong
-
minded
woman
,
 
<EOS>
the
strong
-
minded
probably
of
the
Fawn
family
,
 
but
<EOS>
she
have
now
come
upon
a
task
which
tax
all
her
strength
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
her
mother
that
she
would
tell
"
Frederic
"
what
she
think
about
his
propose
bride
,
and
she
have
now
come
to
carry
out
her
threat
.
<EOS>
She
have
ask
her
brother
to
come
and
dine
with
her
,
but
he
have
decline
.
<EOS>
His
engagement
hardly
admit
of
his
dining
with
his
relative
.
<EOS>
She
have
call
upon
him
at
the
room
he
occupy
in
Victoria
Street
,
 
but
of
course
she
have
not
find
him
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
very
well
go
to
his
club
;
 
so
now
she
have
hunt
him
down
at
his
office
.
<EOS>
from
the
very
commencement
of
the
interview
Mrs.
Hittaway
be
strong
-
minded
.
<EOS>
She
begin
the
subject
of
the
marriage
,
and
do
so
without
a
word
of
congratulation
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Frederic
,
"
she
say
,
"
you
know
that
we
have
all
get
to
look
up
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Clara
,
 
what
do
that
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
mean
this
,
 
that
you
must
bear
with
me
,
if
I
be
more
anxious
as
to
your
future
career
than
another
sister
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
I
know
you
be
go
to
say
something
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
,
Frederic
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
so
many
bad
thing
about
Lady
Eustace
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
Under
-
Secretary
sit
silent
for
awhile
in
his
great
arm
-
chair
.
<EOS>
"
what
sort
of
evil
thing
do
you
mean
,
Clara
?
"
he
ask
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
evil
thing
be
say
of
a
great
many
people
,
 
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
would
not
wish
to
repeat
slander
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
be
not
to
be
silence
after
this
fashion
.
<EOS>
"
not
slander
,
certainly
,
Frederic
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
hear
that
you
intend
to
raise
this
lady
to
the
rank
and
position
of
your
wife
,
then
of
course
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
these
report
become
a
matter
of
great
moment
to
us
all
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
you
have
better
see
Mr.
Camperdown
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
should
he
say
?
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
have
,
I
believe
,
make
some
mistake
about
the
condition
of
her
property
,
and
people
who
have
hear
it
have
be
good
-
natured
enough
to
say
that
the
error
have
be
wilful
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
call
slander
,
Clara
.
"
  
"
and
have
you
hear
about
her
jewel
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
be
allude
here
to
the
report
which
have
reach
her
as
to
Lizzie
's
debt
to
Harter
and
Benjamin
when
she
marry
Sir
Florian
;
but
Lord
Fawn
of
course
think
of
the
diamond
necklace
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
hear
all
about
them
.
<EOS>
who
tell
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
know
it
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
never
get
over
it
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
again
in
the
dark
,
but
he
do
not
choose
to
commit
himself
by
ask
further
question
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
her
treatment
of
Lady
Linlithgow
,
who
be
her
only
friend
before
she
marry
,
be
something
quite
unnatural
.
<EOS>
ask
the
dean
's
people
what
they
think
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
believe
even
they
would
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
Greystock
desire
to
marry
her
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
 
for
her
money
,
perhaps
;
 
because
he
have
not
get
a
farthing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
dear
Frederic
,
I
only
wish
to
put
you
on
your
guard
.
<EOS>
of
course
this
be
very
unpleasant
,
and
I
should
not
do
it
if
I
do
not
think
it
my
duty
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
be
artful
and
very
false
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
deceive
Sir
Florian
Eustace
about
her
debt
;
 
and
he
never
hold
up
his
head
after
he
find
out
what
she
be
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
tell
you
falsehood
,
of
course
you
can
break
it
off
.
<EOS>
dear
Frederic
,
I
hope
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
all
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
bear
it
in
mind
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
be
not
very
pleasant
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
I
know
it
be
not
pleasant
,
"
say
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
rise
,
and
take
her
departure
with
an
offer
of
affectionate
sisterly
greeting
,
which
be
not
accept
with
cordiality
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
that
very
morning
Lord
Fawn
have
receive
letter
from
the
Dean
and
the
Bishop
of
Bobsborough
congratulate
him
on
his
intended
marriage
,
 
both
those
worthy
dignitary
of
the
Church
have
think
it
expedient
to
verify
Lizzie
's
statement
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
,
therefore
,
well
aware
that
Lady
Eustace
have
publish
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
It
be
know
to
everybody
,
and
could
not
be
break
off
without
public
scandal
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
only
think
of
It
"
 
there
be
great
perturbation
down
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
on
the
day
fix
,
Monday
,
June
5
,
Lizzie
arrive
.
<EOS>
nothing
further
have
be
say
by
Lady
Fawn
to
urge
the
invitation
;
but
,
in
accordance
with
the
arrangement
already
make
,
Lady
Eustace
,
with
her
child
,
her
nurse
,
and
her
own
maid
,
be
at
Fawn
Court
by
four
o'clock
.
<EOS>
a
very
long
letter
have
be
receive
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
that
morning
,
 
the
writing
of
which
must
have
seriously
interfere
with
the
tranquillity
of
her
Sunday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
do
not
make
his
appearance
at
Richmond
on
the
Saturday
evening
,
 
nor
be
he
see
on
the
Sunday
.
<EOS>
that
Sunday
be
,
we
may
presume
,
chiefly
devoted
to
reflection
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
do
not
call
upon
his
future
wife
.
<EOS>
His
omission
to
do
so
no
doubt
increase
Lizzie
's
urgency
in
the
matter
of
her
visit
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
have
write
to
congratulate
her
.
"
<EOS>
dear
Frank
,
"
she
have
say
in
reply
,
"
a
woman
situate
as
I
be
have
so
many
thing
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
's
position
will
be
of
service
to
my
child
.
<EOS>
mind
you
come
and
see
me
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
I
count
so
much
on
your
friendship
and
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
she
be
expect
at
Richmond
,
 
<EOS>
although
throughout
the
morning
Lady
Fawn
have
entertain
almost
a
hope
that
she
would
not
come
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
only
lukewarm
in
defend
her
,
"
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
say
in
her
letter
,
"
and
I
still
think
that
there
may
be
an
escape
.
<EOS>
"
not
even
a
note
have
come
from
Lord
Fawn
himself
,
 
nor
from
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
possibly
something
violent
may
have
be
do
,
and
Lady
Eustace
would
not
appear
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Eustace
do
appear
,
 
and
,
after
a
fashion
,
be
make
welcome
at
Fawn
Court
.
  
<EOS>
the
Fawn
lady
be
not
good
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
say
almost
nothing
to
her
daughter
of
her
visit
to
Mount
Street
,
but
Augusta
have
hear
the
discussion
in
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
drawing
-
room
as
to
the
character
of
the
future
bride
.
<EOS>
the
come
visit
have
be
speak
of
almost
with
awe
,
and
there
be
a
general
conviction
in
the
dovecote
that
an
evil
thing
have
fall
upon
them
.
<EOS>
consequently
,
their
affection
to
the
new
-
comer
,
though
speak
in
word
,
be
not
make
evident
by
sign
and
manner
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
herself
take
care
that
the
position
in
which
she
be
receive
should
be
sufficiently
declare
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
so
odd
that
I
be
to
come
among
you
as
a
sister
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
the
girl
be
force
to
assent
to
the
claim
,
but
they
assent
coldly
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
tell
me
to
attach
myself
especially
to
you
,
"
she
whisper
to
Augusta
.
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
choose
one
,
who
have
but
little
strength
of
her
own
,
accept
the
position
,
and
then
,
as
the
only
mean
of
escape
the
embrace
of
her
newly
-
find
sister
,
plead
the
violence
of
a
headache
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
mother
!
"
say
Lizzie
to
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
one
of
the
girl
have
perhaps
better
go
up
and
show
you
your
room
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
much
afraid
about
it
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
to
her
daughter
Amelia
.
<EOS>
Amelia
reply
only
by
shake
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Tuesday
morning
there
come
a
note
from
Lord
Fawn
to
his
lady
-
love
.
<EOS>
of
course
the
letter
be
not
show
,
but
Lizzie
receive
it
at
the
breakfast
table
,
and
read
it
with
many
little
smile
and
sign
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
give
out
various
little
statement
as
have
be
make
in
that
letter
.
<EOS>
He
say
this
,
and
he
say
that
,
and
he
be
come
here
,
and
go
there
,
and
he
will
do
one
thing
,
and
he
will
not
do
the
other
.
<EOS>
We
have
often
see
young
lady
crow
over
their
lover
"
letter
,
and
it
be
pleasant
to
see
Lizzie
crow
over
her
.
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
but
very
little
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
tell
her
that
what
with
the
House
and
what
with
the
Office
,
he
could
not
get
down
to
Richmond
before
Saturday
;
but
that
on
Saturday
he
would
come
.
<EOS>
then
he
sign
himself
"
your
affectionately
,
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
do
her
crow
very
prettily
.
<EOS>
the
outward
show
of
it
be
there
to
perfection
,
 
so
that
the
Fawn
girl
really
believe
that
their
brother
have
write
an
affectionate
lover
's
letter
.
<EOS>
inwardly
,
Lizzie
swear
to
herself
,
as
she
read
the
cold
word
with
indignation
,
that
the
man
should
not
escape
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
go
by
very
tediously
.
<EOS>
on
the
Wednesday
and
the
Friday
Lady
Eustace
make
an
excuse
of
go
up
to
town
,
and
insist
on
take
the
unfortunate
Augusta
with
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
real
reason
for
these
journey
to
London
,
 
unless
that
glance
which
on
each
occasion
be
give
to
the
content
of
the
iron
case
be
a
real
reason
.
<EOS>
the
diamond
be
safe
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
be
enjoy
herself
.
<EOS>
on
the
Friday
Lizzie
propose
to
Augusta
that
they
should
jointly
make
a
raid
upon
the
member
of
Her
Majesty
's
Government
at
his
office
;
but
Augusta
positively
refuse
to
take
such
a
step
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
would
be
angry
,
"
plead
Augusta
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Psha
!
<EOS>
who
care
for
his
anger
?
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
but
the
visit
be
not
make
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Saturday
,
 
the
Saturday
which
be
to
bring
Lord
Fawn
down
to
dinner
,
 
another
most
unexpected
visitor
make
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
at
about
three
o'clock
Frank
Greystock
be
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
now
it
be
certainly
understand
that
Mr.
Greystock
have
be
tell
not
to
come
to
Fawn
Court
as
long
as
Lucy
Morris
be
there
.
"
<EOS>
dear
Mr.
Greystock
,
I
be
sure
you
will
take
what
I
say
as
I
mean
it
,
"
Lady
Fawn
have
whisper
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
attach
we
all
be
to
our
dear
little
Lucy
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
know
 
.
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
more
of
it
;
but
the
meaning
of
it
all
be
undoubtedly
this
,
 
that
Frank
be
not
to
pay
visit
to
Lucy
Morris
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
now
he
have
come
to
see
his
cousin
Lizzie
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
Lady
Fawn
,
with
Amelia
and
two
of
the
other
girl
,
be
out
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
Augusta
have
be
leave
at
home
with
her
bosom
friend
;
 
while
Cecilia
and
Nina
be
suppose
to
be
talk
French
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
out
in
the
ground
,
sit
upon
the
bench
,
and
ramble
among
the
shrubbery
,
when
of
a
sudden
Frank
Greystock
be
in
the
midst
of
them
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
expression
of
joy
at
see
her
cousin
be
almost
as
great
as
though
he
have
be
in
fact
a
brother
.
<EOS>
She
run
up
to
him
and
grasp
his
hand
,
and
hang
on
his
arm
,
and
look
up
into
his
face
,
and
then
burst
into
tear
.
<EOS>
but
the
tear
be
not
violent
tear
.
<EOS>
there
be
just
three
sobs
,
and
two
bright
eye
full
of
water
,
and
a
lace
handkerchief
,
 
and
then
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frank
,
"
she
say
,
"
it
do
make
one
think
so
of
old
time
!
"
<EOS>
Augusta
have
by
this
time
be
almost
persuade
to
believe
in
her
,
 
though
the
belief
by
no
mean
make
the
poor
young
woman
happy
.
<EOS>
Frank
think
that
his
cousin
look
very
well
,
and
say
something
as
to
Lord
Fawn
be
"
the
happy
fellow
go
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
make
him
happy
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
clasp
her
hand
together
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
meanwhile
be
stand
in
the
circle
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
never
occur
to
her
that
it
be
her
duty
to
run
away
from
the
man
she
love
.
<EOS>
She
have
shake
hand
with
him
,
and
feel
something
of
affection
in
his
pressure
.
<EOS>
She
do
believe
that
his
visit
be
make
entirely
to
his
cousin
,
and
have
no
idea
at
the
moment
of
disobey
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
during
the
last
few
day
she
have
be
throw
very
much
with
her
old
friend
Lizzie
,
and
have
be
treat
by
the
future
peeress
with
many
sign
of
almost
sisterly
affection
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Lucy
,
"
Lizzie
have
say
,
"
you
can
understand
me
.
<EOS>
these
people
,
 
oh
,
they
be
so
good
,
but
they
can
not
understand
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
have
express
a
hope
that
Lord
Fawn
understand
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Lord
Fawn
,
 
well
;
<EOS>
yes
;
perhaps
;
 
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
It
so
often
happen
that
one
's
husband
be
the
last
person
to
understand
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
think
so
,
I
would
not
marry
him
,
"
say
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
Greystock
will
understand
you
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
true
that
Lucy
do
understand
something
of
her
wealthy
friend
's
character
,
and
be
almost
ashamed
of
the
friendship
.
<EOS>
with
Lizzie
Greystock
she
have
never
sympathise
,
and
Lizzie
Eustace
have
always
be
distasteful
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
already
feel
that
the
less
she
should
see
of
Lizzie
Fawn
the
well
she
should
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
before
an
hour
be
over
,
Frank
Greystock
be
walk
round
the
shrubbery
with
Lucy
,
 
and
be
walk
with
Lucy
alone
.
<EOS>
It
be
undoubtedly
the
fact
that
Lady
Eustace
have
contrive
that
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
the
unfitness
of
the
thing
recommend
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
Frank
could
hardly
marry
a
wife
without
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
Lucy
would
certainly
not
think
at
all
of
shilling
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
 
as
Lizzie
know
,
 
have
be
almost
at
her
foot
within
the
last
fortnight
,
and
may
,
in
some
possible
emergency
,
be
there
again
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
such
circumstance
nothing
could
be
well
than
that
Frank
and
Lucy
should
be
throw
together
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
regard
all
this
as
romance
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Fawn
,
have
she
know
it
all
,
would
have
call
it
diabolical
wickedness
and
inhuman
cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Lucy
;
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
say
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
think
of
what
,
Mr.
Greystock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
;
 
this
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
should
I
be
able
to
think
?
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
them
together
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Lord
Fawn
be
not
very
rich
.
<EOS>
She
be
rich
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
be
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
her
very
beautiful
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
sometimes
exquisitely
lovely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
everybody
say
so
;
 
and
I
be
sure
it
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
;
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
will
think
I
be
envious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
think
you
envious
of
Lizzie
,
I
should
have
to
think
you
very
foolish
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
that
mean
;
"
 
she
do
know
well
enough
what
it
mean
;
 
"
but
sometimes
to
me
she
be
almost
frightful
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
what
way
?
"
  
"
oh
,
I
can
not
tell
you
.
<EOS>
She
look
like
a
beautiful
animal
that
you
be
afraid
to
caress
for
fear
it
should
bite
you
;
 
an
animal
that
would
be
beautiful
if
its
eye
be
not
so
restless
,
and
its
tooth
so
sharp
and
so
white
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
odd
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
odd
,
Mr.
Greystock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
feel
exactly
in
the
same
way
about
her
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
in
the
least
afraid
that
she
will
bite
me
;
and
as
for
caress
the
animal
,
 
that
kind
of
caress
which
you
mean
,
 
it
seem
to
me
to
be
just
what
she
be
make
for
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
do
feel
sometimes
,
that
she
be
like
a
cat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
something
not
quite
so
tame
as
a
cat
,
"
say
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
nevertheless
she
be
very
lovely
,
 
and
very
clever
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
her
the
most
beautiful
woman
I
ever
see
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
,
indeed
?
"
  
"
She
will
be
immensely
run
after
as
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
when
she
please
she
can
make
her
own
house
quite
charming
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
a
woman
who
could
say
pretty
thing
to
so
many
people
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
make
her
out
to
be
a
paragon
of
perfection
,
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
when
you
add
to
all
the
rest
that
she
have
four
thousand
a
year
,
you
must
admit
that
Lord
Fawn
be
a
lucky
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
say
nothing
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
four
thousand
a
year
be
a
very
great
consideration
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
Lucy
for
a
while
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
be
make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
say
nothing
;
 
that
she
would
make
no
reply
indicative
of
any
feeling
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
sufficiently
strong
to
keep
her
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
"
she
say
,
"
that
you
do
not
attempt
to
win
the
great
prize
yourself
.
<EOS>
cousin
do
marry
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
think
of
attempt
it
,
and
at
this
moment
he
would
not
lie
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
cousinship
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
do
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
thank
God
,
I
only
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
refrain
herself
from
look
up
into
his
face
and
clasp
her
hand
together
.
<EOS>
a
woman
never
so
dearly
love
a
man
as
when
he
confess
that
he
have
be
on
the
brink
of
a
great
crime
,

have
refrain
,

have
not

take
me

I
have
no
reason
whatever
for

so

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
she
would
,
"
say
Lucy
,
who
do
not
in
the
least
know
what
word
she
be
utter
.
  
<EOS>

It
would
have
be
simply
for
her
money

her
money
and
her
beauty

be
because
I
love
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
never
 
never
ask
a
girl
to
marry
you
,
unless
you
love
her

Mr.

<EOS>
"
then
there
be
only
one
that
I
can
ever
ask

"
say
he
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
of
course
that
she
could
say
to
this
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
not
choose
to
go
further
,
she
be
not
bind
to
understand
him

<EOS>
but
would
he
go
further
?
<EOS>
She
feel
at
the
moment
that
an
open
declaration
of
his
love
to
herself
would
make
her
happy
for
ever

even

it
should
be
accompany
by
an
assurance

that
it
be
so
between
them

that
,
she
think
,
would
be
enough
for
her

<EOS>
and
as
for
him
 
if
a
woman
could
bear
such
a
position
,
surely
he
may
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
who
that
one
be
?
"
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
she
say
,
 
shake
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy

be
that
true

what
do
it
matter

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
;
 
look
at
me
,
Lucy
,
"
and
he
put
his
hand
upon
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
 
no
,
 
no
!
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
you
so
well

Lucy

that
I
never

<EOS>
I
have
think
of
many
woman
,
but
could
never
even
think
of
one
,
as
a
woman
to
love
,
except
you

<EOS>
I
have
sometimes
fancy
I
could
marry
for
money
and
position
,
 
to
help
myself
on
in
the
world
by
mean
of
a
wife

when
my
mind
have
run
away
with
me
,
to
revel
amidst
idea
of
feminine
sweetness
,
you
have
always
 
always
be
the
heroine
of
the
tale

as
the
mistress
of
the
happy
castle
in
the
air

have
I

she
ask

always
,
 
always

regard
this
,

he
strike
himself
on
the
breast
,
 
"
no
man
be
ever
more
constant
.
<EOS>
though
I
do
not
think
much
of
myself
as
a
man
,
I
know
a
woman
when
I
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
but
he
do
not
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
;
 
nor
do
he
wait
at
Fawn
Court
till
Lady
Fawn
have
come
back
with
the
carriage
.
   
<EOS>
show
<EOS>
what
Frank
Greystock
<EOS>
do
 
Frank
Greystock
escape
from
the
dovecote
before
Lady
Fawn
have
return
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
make
his
visit
to
Richmond
with
any
purpose
of
see
Lucy
Morris
,
or
of
say
to
her
when
he
do
see
her
anything
special
,
 
of
say
anything
that
should
,
or
anything
that
should
not
,
have
be
say
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
there
,
in
truth
,
simply
because
his
cousin
have
ask
him
,
and
because
it
be
almost
a
duty
on
his
part
to
see
his
cousin
on
the
momentous
occasion
of
this
new
engagement
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
declare
to
himself
that
old
Lady
Fawn
be
a
fool
,
and
that
to
see
Lucy
again
would
be
very
pleasant
.
"
<EOS>
see
her
;
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
will
see
her
,
"
he
have
say
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
be
prevent
from
see
her
?
"
<EOS>
now
he
have
see
her
,
and
as
he
return
by
the
train
to
London
,
he
acknowledge
to
himself
that
it
be
no
longer
in
his
power
to
promote
his
fortune
by
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
have
at
last
say
that
to
Lucy
which
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
offer
his
hand
to
any
other
woman
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
,
in
truth
,
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
;
but
he
have
tell
her
that
he
love
her
,
and
could
never
love
any
other
woman
.
<EOS>
He
have
ask
for
no
answer
to
this
assurance
,
and
then
he
have
leave
her
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
that
afternoon
he
do
question
himself
as
to
his
conduct
to
this
girl
,
and
subject
himself
to
some
of
the
rigours
of
a
cross
-
examination
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
man
who
could
think
of
a
girl
as
the
one
human
being
whom
he
love
above
all
other
,
and
yet
look
forward
with
equanimity
to
the
idea
of
do
her
an
injury
.
<EOS>
He
could
understand
that
a
man
unable
to
marry
should
be
reticent
as
to
his
feeling
,
 
suppose
him
to
have
be
weak
enough
to
have
succumb
to
a
passion
which
could
only
mar
his
own
prospect
.
<EOS>
He
be
frank
enough
in
own
to
himself
that
he
have
be
thus
weak
.
<EOS>
the
weakness
have
come
upon
himself
early
in
life
,
 
and
be
there
,
an
establish
fact
.
<EOS>
the
girl
be
to
him
unlike
any
other
girl
;
 
or
any
man
.
<EOS>
there
be
to
him
a
sweetness
in
her
companionship
which
he
could
not
analyse
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
beautiful
.
<EOS>
She
have
none
of
the
charm
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
see
her
well
-
dress
,
 
accord
to
the
idea
of
dress
which
he
find
to
be
prevail
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
thing
,
who
,
as
a
man
's
wife
,
could
attract
no
attention
by
figure
,
form
,
or
outward
manner
,
 
one
who
have
quietly
submit
herself
to
the
position
of
a
governess
,
and
who
do
not
seem
to
think
that
in
do
so
she
obtain
less
than
her
due
.
<EOS>
but
yet
he
know
her
to
be
well
than
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
for
him
,
at
any
rate
,
she
be
well
than
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Her
little
hand
be
cool
and
sweet
to
him
.
<EOS>
sometimes
when
he
be
heated
and
hard
at
work
,
he
would
fancy
how
it
would
be
with
him
if
she
be
by
him
,
and
would
lay
it
on
his
brow
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
sparkle
in
her
eye
that
have
to
him
more
of
sympathy
in
it
than
could
be
convey
by
all
the
other
eye
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
expression
in
her
mouth
when
she
smile
,
which
be
more
eloquent
to
him
than
any
sound
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
reality
and
a
truth
about
her
which
come
home
to
him
,
and
make
themselves
known
to
him
as
firm
rock
which
could
not
be
shake
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
declare
to
himself
that
deceit
or
hypocrisy
in
a
woman
be
especially
abominable
.
<EOS>
as
a
rule
he
look
for
it
in
woman
,
and
would
say
that
some
amount
of
affectation
be
necessary
to
a
woman
's
character
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
his
cousin
Lizzie
be
a
little
liar
,
 
that
she
be
,
as
Lucy
have
say
,
a
pretty
animal
that
would
turn
and
bite
;
 
and
yet
he
like
his
cousin
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
want
woman
to
be
perfect
,
 
so
he
would
say
.
<EOS>
but
Lucy
Morris
,
in
his
eye
,
be
perfect
;
and
when
he
tell
her
that
she
be
ever
the
queen
who
reign
in
those
castle
in
the
air
which
he
build
,
 
as
other
build
them
,
he
tell
her
no
more
than
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
fall
into
these
feeling
and
could
not
now
avoid
them
,
or
be
quit
of
them
;
 
but
he
could
have
be
silent
respect
them
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
in
former
day
,
down
at
Bobsborough
,
he
have
not
be
altogether
silent
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
first
see
her
at
Fawn
Court
he
have
not
be
altogether
silent
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
be
warn
away
from
Fawn
Court
,
and
in
that
very
warning
there
be
convey
,
as
it
be
,
an
absolution
from
the
effect
of
word
hitherto
speak
.
<EOS>
though
he
have
call
Lady
Fawn
an
old
fool
,
he
have
know
that
it
be
so
,
 
have
,
after
a
fashion
,
perceive
her
wisdom
,
 
and
have
regard
himself
as
a
man
free
to
decide
,
without
disgrace
,
that
he
may
abandon
idea
of
ecstatic
love
and
look
out
for
a
rich
wife
.
<EOS>
presume
himself
to
be
reticent
for
the
future
in
reference
to
his
darling
Lucy
,
he
may
do
as
he
please
with
himself
.
<EOS>
thus
there
have
come
a
moment
in
which
he
have
determine
that
he
would
ask
his
rich
cousin
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
in
that
little
project
he
have
be
interrupt
,
and
the
reader
know
what
have
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
's
success
have
not
in
the
least
annoy
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
only
half
resolve
in
regard
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
beautiful
no
doubt
,
and
there
be
her
income
;
 
but
he
also
know
that
those
tooth
would
bite
and
that
those
claw
would
scratch
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
Fawn
's
success
have
give
a
turn
to
his
thought
,
and
have
make
him
think
,
for
a
moment
,
that
if
a
man
love
,
he
should
be
true
to
his
love
.
<EOS>
the
reader
also
know
what
have
come
of
that
,
 
how
at
last
he
have
not
be
reticent
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
ask
Lucy
to
be
his
wife
;
but
he
have
say
that
which
make
it
impossible
that
he
should
marry
any
other
woman
without
dishonour
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
think
of
what
he
have
do
himself
,
he
try
to
remember
whether
Lucy
have
say
a
word
expressive
of
affection
for
himself
.
<EOS>
She
have
in
truth
speak
very
few
word
,
and
he
could
remember
almost
every
one
of
them
.
"
<EOS>
have
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
she
have
ask
,
when
he
tell
her
that
she
have
ever
be
the
princess
reign
in
his
castle
.
<EOS>
and
there
have
be
a
joy
in
the
question
which
she
have
not
attempt
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
She
have
hesitate
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
tell
him
that
she
love
him
.
<EOS>
but
there
have
be
something
sweet
than
such
protestation
in
the
question
she
have
ask
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
it
indeed
true
,
"
she
have
say
,
"
that
I
have
be
place
there
where
all
my
joy
and
all
my
glory
lie
?
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
in
her
to
tell
a
lie
to
him
,
even
by
a
tone
.
<EOS>
She
have
intend
to
say
nothing
of
her
love
,
but
he
know
that
it
have
all
be
tell
.
<EOS>
"
have
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
he
repeat
the
word
to
himself
a
dozen
time
,
and
as
he
do
so
,
he
could
hear
her
voice
.
<EOS>
certainly
there
never
be
a
voice
that
bring
home
to
the
hearer
so
strong
a
sense
of
its
own
truth
!
  
<EOS>
why
should
he
not
at
once
make
up
his
mind
to
marry
her
?
<EOS>
He
could
do
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
of
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
possible
for
him
to
alter
the
whole
manner
of
his
life
,
to
give
up
his
club
,
 
to
give
up
even
Parliament
,
if
the
need
to
do
so
be
there
,
 
and
to
live
as
a
married
man
on
the
earning
of
his
profession
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
why
he
should
regard
himself
as
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
two
thing
,
no
doubt
,
be
against
his
regard
himself
as
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
ever
since
he
have
commence
life
in
London
he
have
be
more
or
less
in
debt
;
and
then
,
unfortunately
,
he
have
acquire
a
seat
in
Parliament
at
a
period
of
his
career
in
which
the
danger
of
such
a
position
be
great
than
the
advantage
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
could
earn
an
income
on
which
he
and
his
wife
,
be
he
to
marry
,
could
live
in
all
comfort
;
and
as
to
his
debt
,
if
he
would
set
his
shoulder
to
the
work
they
may
be
pay
off
in
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
the
prospect
which
would
frighten
Lucy
,
though
there
may
be
a
question
whether
he
possess
the
courage
need
for
so
violent
a
change
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
chamber
in
the
Temple
;
he
live
in
room
which
he
hire
from
month
to
month
in
one
of
the
big
hotel
at
the
West
End
;
and
he
dine
at
his
club
,
or
at
the
House
,
when
he
be
not
dine
with
a
friend
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
expensive
and
a
luxurious
mode
of
life
,
 
and
one
from
the
effect
of
which
a
man
be
prone
to
drift
very
quickly
into
selfishness
.
<EOS>
He
be
by
no
mean
give
to
drinking
,
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
already
learn
to
like
good
wine
.
<EOS>
small
economy
in
reference
to
cab
-
hire
,
glove
,
umbrella
,
and
railway
fare
be
unknown
to
him
.
<EOS>
sixpence
and
shilling
be
thing
with
which
,
in
his
mind
,
it
be
grievous
to
have
to
burden
the
thought
.
<EOS>
the
Greystocks
have
all
live
after
that
fashion
.
<EOS>
even
the
dean
himself
be
not
free
from
the
charge
of
extravagance
.
<EOS>
all
this
Frank
know
,
and
he
do
not
hesitate
to
tell
himself
,
that
he
must
make
a
great
change
if
he
mean
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
wise
enough
to
know
that
the
change
would
become
more
difficult
every
day
that
it
be
postpone
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
the
question
have
be
an
open
question
with
him
.
<EOS>
Could
it
now
be
an
open
question
any
longer
?
<EOS>
as
a
man
of
honour
,
be
he
not
bind
to
share
his
lot
with
Lucy
Morris
?
  
<EOS>
that
evening
,
 
that
Saturday
evening
,
 
it
so
happen
that
he
meet
John
Eustace
at
a
club
to
which
they
both
belong
,
and
they
dine
together
.
<EOS>
They
have
long
know
each
other
,
and
have
be
throw
into
close
intimacy
by
the
marriage
between
Sir
Florian
and
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
have
never
be
fond
of
Lizzie
,
and
now
,
in
truth
,
like
her
less
than
ever
;
but
he
do
like
Lizzie
's
cousin
,
and
feel
that
possibly
Frank
may
be
of
use
to
him
in
the
grow
difficulty
of
manage
the
heir
's
property
and
look
after
the
heir
's
interest
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
let
the
widow
slip
through
your
finger
,
"
he
say
to
Frank
,
as
they
sit
together
at
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
Lord
Fawn
be
to
be
the
lucky
man
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
I
wish
it
have
be
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
<EOS>
Fawn
be
not
a
bad
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
not
exactly
a
bad
fellow
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
,
you
know
,
what
I
call
a
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
be
marry
her
altogether
for
her
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
which
be
just
what
you
advise
me
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
really
like
her
.
<EOS>
and
then
Fawn
will
be
always
afraid
of
her
,
 
and
will
not
be
in
the
least
afraid
of
us
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
to
fight
him
,
and
he
will
not
fight
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
cantankerous
fellow
,
 
be
Fawn
,
 
when
he
be
not
afraid
of
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
should
there
be
any
fighting
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eustace
pause
a
minute
,
and
rub
his
face
and
consider
the
matter
before
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
troublesome
,
you
know
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
;
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
 
and
I
begin
to
be
afraid
she
will
give
us
as
much
as
we
know
how
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
with
Camperdown
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
be
bless
if
she
have
not
begin
to
cut
down
a
whole
side
of
a
forest
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
more
right
to
touch
the
timber
,
except
for
repair
about
the
place
,
than
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
if
she
live
for
fifty
year
,
"
ask
Greystock
,
"
be
none
to
be
cut
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
 
by
consent
.
<EOS>
of
course
the
regular
cutting
for
the
year
be
do
,
year
by
year
.
<EOS>
that
be
as
regular
as
the
rent
,
and
the
produce
be
sell
by
the
acre
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
mark
the
old
oak
.
<EOS>
what
the
deuce
can
she
want
money
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fawn
will
put
all
that
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
have
to
do
it
,
"
say
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
since
she
have
be
down
with
the
old
Lady
Fawn
,
she
have
write
a
note
to
Camperdown
,
 
after
leave
all
his
letter
unanswere
for
the
last
twelvemonth
,
 
to
tell
him
that
Lord
Fawn
be
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
property
,
and
that
certain
people
,
call
Mowbray
and
Mopus
,
be
her
lawyer
.
<EOS>
Camperdown
be
in
an
awful
way
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Fawn
will
put
it
all
right
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Camperdown
be
afraid
that
he
will
not
.
<EOS>
They
have
meet
twice
since
the
engagement
be
make
,
and
Camperdown
say
that
,
at
the
last
meeting
,
Fawn
give
himself
air
,
or
be
,
at
any
rate
,
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
there
be
word
about
those
diamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
to
say
that
Lord
Fawn
want
to
keep
your
brother
's
family
jewel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Camperdown
do
not
say
that
exactly
;
 
but
Fawn
make
no
offer
of
give
them
up
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
there
,
and
only
hear
what
Camperdown
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Camperdown
think
he
be
afraid
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
wonder
at
that
in
the
least
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
there
will
be
trouble
,
"
continue
eustace
,
"
and
Fawn
will
not
be
able
to
help
us
through
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
strong
-
willed
,
cunning
,
obstinate
,
clever
little
creature
.
<EOS>
Camperdown
swear
he
will
be
too
many
for
her
,
but
I
almost
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
therefore
you
wish
I
be
go
to
marry
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
You
may
manage
her
.
<EOS>
the
money
come
from
the
Eustace
property
,
and
I
would
sooner
it
should
go
to
you
than
a
half
-
hearted
,
numb
-
finger
,
cold
-
blooded
Whig
,
like
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
cunne
woman
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
bargain
go
,
it
would
not
be
a
bad
one
,
"
say
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
young
,
have
a
noble
jointure
,
and
be
as
handsome
as
she
can
stand
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
good
a
thing
for
Fawn
;
 
too
good
for
any
Whig
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
Eustace
leave
him
,
Greystock
light
his
cigar
and
walk
with
it
in
his
mouth
from
Pall
Mall
to
the
Temple
.
<EOS>
He
often
work
there
at
night
when
he
be
not
bind
to
be
in
the
House
,
or
when
the
House
be
not
sit
,
 
and
he
be
now
intent
on
master
the
mystery
of
some
much
-
complicated
legal
case
which
have
be
confide
to
him
,
in
order
that
he
may
present
it
to
a
jury
envelop
in
increase
mystery
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
go
,
he
think
rather
of
matrimony
than
of
law
;
 
and
he
think
especially
of
matrimony
as
it
be
about
to
affect
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Could
a
man
be
justify
in
marry
for
money
,
or
have
rational
ground
for
expect
that
he
may
make
himself
happy
by
do
so
?
<EOS>
He
keep
mutter
to
himself
as
he
go
,
the
Quaker
's
advice
to
the
old
farmer
,
"
Doan't
thou
marry
for
munny
,
but
goa
where
munny
be
!
"
<EOS>
but
he
mutter
it
as
condemn
the
advice
rather
than
accept
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
look
out
and
see
two
altogether
different
kind
of
life
before
him
,
both
of
which
have
their
allurement
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
Belgravia
-
cum
-
Pimlico
life
,
the
scene
of
which
may
extend
itself
to
South
Kensington
,
envelop
the
park
and
come
round
over
Park
Lane
,
and
through
Grosvenor
Square
and
Berkeley
Square
back
to
Piccadilly
.
<EOS>
within
this
he
may
live
with
lord
and
countess
and
rich
folk
generally
,
go
out
to
the
very
good
dinner
-
party
,
avoid
stupid
people
,
have
everything
the
world
could
give
,
except
a
wife
and
family
and
home
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
all
this
he
could
achieve
by
the
work
which
would
certainly
fall
in
his
way
,
and
by
mean
of
that
position
in
the
world
which
he
have
already
attain
by
his
wit
.
<EOS>
and
the
wife
,
with
the
family
and
house
of
his
own
,
may
be
forthcoming
,
should
it
ever
come
in
his
way
to
form
an
attachment
with
a
wealthy
woman
.
<EOS>
He
know
how
dangerous
be
the
charm
of
such
a
life
as
this
to
a
man
grow
old
among
the
flesh
-
pot
,
without
any
one
to
depend
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
what
become
of
the
man
who
be
always
dine
out
at
sixty
.
<EOS>
but
he
may
avoid
that
.
"
<EOS>
Doan't
thou
marry
for
munny
,
but
goa
where
munny
be
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
that
other
outlook
<EOS>
,
the
scene
of
which
be
lay
somewhere
north
of
Oxford
Street
,
and
the
glory
of
which
consist
in
Lucy
's
smile
,
and
Lucy
's
hand
,
and
Lucy
's
kiss
,
as
he
return
home
weary
from
his
work
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
man
,
and
some
woman
,
who
pass
their
life
without
know
what
it
be
to
be
or
to
have
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
They
not
improbably
marry
,
 
the
man
do
,
at
least
,
 
and
make
good
average
husband
.
<EOS>
Their
wife
be
useful
to
them
,
and
they
learn
to
feel
that
a
woman
,
be
a
wife
,
be
entitle
to
all
the
respect
,
protection
,
and
honour
which
a
man
can
give
,
or
procure
for
her
.
<EOS>
such
man
,
no
doubt
,
often
live
honest
life
,
be
good
Christians
,
and
depart
hence
with
hope
as
justifiable
as
though
they
have
love
as
well
as
Romeo
.
<EOS>
but
yet
,
as
man
,
they
have
lack
a
something
,
the
want
of
which
have
make
them
small
and
poor
and
dry
.
<EOS>
It
have
never
be
feel
by
such
a
one
that
there
would
be
triumph
in
give
away
everything
belong
to
him
for
one
little
whispered
,
yield
word
,
in
which
there
should
be
acknowledgment
that
he
have
succeed
in
make
himself
master
of
a
human
heart
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
other
man
,
 
very
many
man
,
 
who
have
feel
this
love
,
and
have
resist
it
,
feel
it
to
be
unfit
that
love
should
be
Lord
of
all
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
have
tell
himself
,
a
score
of
time
,
that
it
would
be
unbecoming
in
him
to
allow
a
passion
to
obtain
such
mastery
of
him
as
to
interfere
with
his
ambition
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
right
that
he
who
,
as
a
young
man
,
have
already
do
so
much
,
who
may
possibly
have
before
him
so
high
and
great
a
career
,
should
miss
that
,
because
he
could
not
resist
a
feeling
which
a
little
chit
of
a
girl
have
create
in
his
bosom
,
 
a
girl
without
money
,
without
position
,
without
even
beauty
;
a
girl
as
to
whom
,
be
he
to
marry
her
,
the
world
would
say
,
"
oh
,
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
there
have
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
go
and
marry
a
little
governess
out
of
old
Lady
Fawn
's
nursery
!
"
<EOS>
and
yet
he
love
her
with
all
his
heart
,
and
to
-
day
he
have
tell
her
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
what
should
he
do
next
?
  
<EOS>
the
complicated
legal
case
receive
neither
much
ravel
nor
unravel
from
his
brain
that
night
;
but
before
he
leave
his
chamber
he
write
the
following
letter
:
    
Midnight
,
Saturday
,
all
among
my
book
and
paper
,
2
,
Bolt
Court
,
Middle
Temple
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
,
dear
LUCY
,
  
I
tell
you
to
-
day
that
you
have
ever
be
the
Queen
who
reign
in
those
palace
which
I
have
build
in
Spain
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
make
me
much
of
an
answer
;
but
such
as
it
be
,
 
only
just
one
muttered
doubtful
-
sound
word
,
 
it
have
make
me
hope
that
I
may
be
justify
in
ask
you
to
share
with
me
a
home
which
will
not
be
palatial
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
wrong
 
?
<EOS>
but
no
;
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
think
I
be
wrong
,
or
that
I
can
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
no
sound
come
from
you
be
really
doubtful
.
<EOS>
You
be
truth
itself
,
and
the
muttered
word
would
have
be
other
than
it
be
,
if
you
have
not
 
!
<EOS>
may
I
say
,
 
have
you
not
already
learn
to
love
me
?
  
<EOS>
You
will
feel
,
perhaps
,
that
I
ought
to
have
say
all
this
to
you
then
,
and
that
a
letter
in
such
a
matter
be
but
a
poor
substitute
for
a
spoken
assurance
of
affection
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
though
I
have
long
love
you
,
I
do
not
go
down
to
Fawn
Court
with
the
purpose
of
declare
to
you
my
love
.
<EOS>
what
I
say
to
you
be
God
's
truth
;
but
it
be
speak
without
thought
at
the
moment
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
of
it
much
since
;
 
and
now
I
write
to
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
have
live
for
the
last
year
or
two
with
this
hope
before
me
;
and
now
 
Dear
,
dear
Lucy
,
I
will
not
write
in
too
great
confidence
;
but
I
will
tell
you
that
all
my
happiness
be
in
your
hand
.
  
<EOS>
if
your
answer
be
what
I
hope
it
may
be
,
tell
Lady
Fawn
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
shall
immediately
write
to
Bobsborough
,
as
I
hate
secret
in
such
matter
.
<EOS>
and
if
it
be
to
be
so
,
 
then
I
shall
claim
the
privilege
of
go
to
Fawn
Court
as
soon
and
as
often
as
I
please
.
  
<EOS>
yours
ever
and
always
,
 
if
you
will
have
me
,
    
F.

He
sit
for
an
hour
at
his
desk
,
with
his
letter
lie
on
the
table
,
before
he
leave
his
chamber
,
 
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
if
he
should
decide
on
post
it
,
then
would
that
life
in
Belgravia
-
cum
-
Pimlico
,
 
of
which
in
truth
he
be
very
fond
,
 
be
almost
closed
for
him
.
<EOS>
the
lord
and
countess
,
and
rich
county
member
,
and
lead
politician
,
who
be
delighted
to
welcome
him
,
would
not
care
for
his
wife
;
nor
could
he
very
well
take
his
wife
among
them
.
<EOS>
to
live
with
them
as
a
married
man
,
he
must
live
as
they
live
;
 
and
must
have
his
own
house
in
their
precinct
.
<EOS>
later
in
life
,
he
may
possibly
work
up
to
this
;
 
but
for
the
present
he
must
retire
into
dim
domestic
security
and
the
neighbourhood
of
Regent
's
Park
.
<EOS>
He
sit
look
at
the
letter
,
tell
himself
that
he
be
now
,
at
this
moment
,
decide
his
own
fate
in
life
.
<EOS>
and
he
again
mutter
the
Quaker
's
advice
,
"
Doan't
thou
marry
for
munny
,
but
goa
where
munny
be
!
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
say
,
however
,
that
no
man
ever
write
such
a
letter
,
and
then
omit
to
send
it
.
<EOS>
He
walk
out
of
the
Temple
with
it
in
his
hand
,
and
drop
it
into
a
pillar
letter
-
box
just
outside
the
gate
.
<EOS>
as
the
envelope
slip
through
his
finger
,
he
feel
that
he
have
now
bind
himself
to
his
fate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Doan't
Thou
Marry
for
Munny
"
 
<EOS>
as
that
Saturday
afternoon
wear
itself
away
,
there
be
much
excitement
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
when
Lady
Fawn
return
with
the
carriage
,
she
hear
that
Frank
Greystock
have
be
at
Fawn
Court
;
and
she
hear
also
,
from
Augusta
,
that
he
have
be
ramble
about
the
ground
alone
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
at
any
exhibition
of
old
lady
,
hold
before
a
competent
jury
,
Lady
Fawn
would
have
take
a
prize
on
the
score
of
good
humour
.
<EOS>
no
mother
of
daughter
be
ever
less
addicted
to
scold
and
to
be
fretful
.
<EOS>
but
just
now
she
be
a
little
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
visit
have
not
be
a
success
,
and
she
look
forward
to
her
son
's
marriage
with
almost
unmixed
dismay
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
write
daily
,
and
in
all
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
letter
some
addition
be
make
to
the
evil
thing
already
know
.
<EOS>
in
her
last
letter
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
express
her
opinion
that
even
yet
"
Frederic
"
would
escape
.
<EOS>
all
this
Lady
Fawn
have
,
of
course
,
not
tell
to
her
daughter
generally
.
<EOS>
to
the
eld
,
Augusta
,
it
be
think
expedient
to
say
nothing
,
because
Augusta
have
be
select
as
the
companion
of
the
,
alas
!
<EOS>
too
probable
future
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
but
to
Amelia
something
do
leak
out
,
and
it
become
apparent
that
the
household
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
now
,
 
as
an
evil
add
to
this
,
 
Frank
Greystock
have
be
there
in
Lady
Fawn
's
absence
,
walk
about
the
ground
alone
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
could
hardly
restrain
herself
.
<EOS>
"
how
could
Lucy
be
so
very
wrong
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
in
the
hearing
both
of
Augusta
and
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
do
not
hear
this
;
but
know
very
well
that
a
governess
should
not
receive
a
lover
in
the
absence
of
the
lady
of
the
house
,
she
make
her
little
speech
about
it
.
"
<EOS>
dear
Lady
Fawn
,
"
she
say
,
"
my
cousin
Frank
come
to
see
me
while
you
be
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
hear
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
and
I
be
more
like
brother
and
sister
than
anything
else
.
<EOS>
I
have
so
much
to
say
to
him
;
 
so
much
to
ask
him
to
do
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
one
else
,
you
know
,
and
I
have
especially
tell
him
to
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
be
welcome
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
I
be
afraid
you
may
think
that
there
be
some
little
lover
's
trick
,
 
on
dear
Lucy
's
part
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
suspect
anything
of
that
kind
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
,
bridle
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
be
above
any
sort
of
trick
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
have
any
trick
here
,
Lady
Eustace
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
herself
may
say
that
Lucy
be
"
wrong
,
"
but
no
one
else
in
that
house
should
even
suggest
evil
of
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
retreat
smile
.
<EOS>
to
have
"
put
Lady
Fawn
be
back
up
,
"
as
she
call
it
,
be
to
her
an
achievement
and
a
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
great
excitement
of
the
evening
consist
in
the
expect
coming
of
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
of
what
nature
would
be
the
meeting
between
Lord
Fawn
and
his
promised
bride
?
<EOS>
be
there
anything
of
truth
in
the
opinion
express
by
Mrs.
Hittaway
that
her
brother
be
begin
to
become
tired
of
his
bargain
?
<EOS>
that
Lady
Fawn
be
tired
of
it
herself
,
 
that
she
dislike
Lizzie
,
and
be
afraid
of
her
,
and
averse
to
the
idea
of
regard
her
as
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
 
she
do
not
now
attempt
to
hide
from
herself
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
the
engagement
,
know
to
all
the
world
,
and
how
could
its
fulfilment
now
be
avoid
?
<EOS>
the
poor
dear
old
woman
begin
to
repeat
to
herself
the
first
half
of
the
Quaker
's
advice
,
"
Doan't
thou
marry
for
munny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
to
come
down
only
in
time
for
a
late
dinner
.
<EOS>
an
ardent
lover
,
one
would
have
think
,
may
have
leave
his
work
somewhat
earlier
on
a
Saturday
,
so
as
to
have
enjoy
with
his
sweetheart
something
of
the
sweetness
of
the
Saturday
summer
afternoon
;
 
but
it
be
seven
before
he
reach
Fawn
Court
,
and
the
lady
be
at
that
time
in
their
room
dress
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
affect
to
understand
all
his
reason
for
be
so
late
,
and
have
express
herself
as
perfectly
satisfied
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
more
to
do
than
any
of
the
other
,
"
she
have
say
to
Augusta
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
whole
of
our
vast
indian
empire
may
be
say
to
hang
upon
him
,
just
at
present
;
"
 
which
be
not
complimentary
to
Lord
Fawn
's
chief
,
the
right
honourable
Legge
Wilson
,
who
at
the
present
time
represent
the
interest
of
India
in
the
Cabinet
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
terribly
overwork
,
and
it
be
a
shame
;
 
but
what
can
one
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
like
work
,
"
Augusta
have
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
like
it
,
 
not
so
much
of
it
;
and
so
I
shall
make
him
understand
,
<EOS>
my
dear
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
complain
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
he
tell
me
everything
,
I
will
never
really
complain
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
may
some
day
be
as
she
desire
;
perhaps
as
a
husband
he
would
be
thoroughly
confidential
and
communicative
;
perhaps
when
they
two
be
one
flesh
he
would
tell
her
everything
about
India
;
 
but
as
yet
he
certainly
have
not
tell
her
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
have
they
better
meet
?
<EOS>
"
Amelia
ask
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
;
 
I
do
not
know
;
 
anyhow
;
just
as
they
like
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
arrange
anything
for
her
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
choose
to
dress
herself
early
,
she
may
have
see
him
as
he
come
in
;
but
it
be
impossible
to
tell
her
so
.
<EOS>
"
no
arrangement
be
therefore
make
,
and
as
all
the
other
lady
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
before
Lizzie
come
down
,
she
have
to
give
him
his
welcome
in
the
midst
of
the
family
circle
.
<EOS>
She
do
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
have
think
of
it
,
and
make
her
arrangement
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
forward
to
greet
her
,
she
put
her
cheek
up
,
just
a
little
,
so
that
he
may
see
that
he
be
expect
to
kiss
it
;
 
<EOS>
but
so
little
,
that
should
he
omit
to
do
so
,
there
may
be
no
visible
awkwardness
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledge
on
Lizzie
's
behalf
,
that
she
could
always
avoid
awkwardness
.
<EOS>
He
do
touch
her
cheek
with
his
lip
,
blush
as
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
her
ungloved
hand
in
his
,
and
,
still
hold
him
,
return
into
the
circle
.
<EOS>
She
say
not
a
word
;
and
what
he
say
be
of
no
moment
;
 
but
they
have
meet
as
lover
,
and
any
of
the
family
who
have
allow
themselves
to
imagine
that
even
yet
the
match
may
be
break
,
now
unconsciously
abandon
that
hope
.
<EOS>
"
be
he
always
such
a
truant
,
Lady
Fawn
?
"
 
<EOS>
Lizzie
ask
,
when
it
seem
to
her
that
no
one
else
would
speak
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
there
be
much
difference
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
here
be
dinner
.
<EOS>
Frederic
,
will
you
give
 
Lady
Eustace
your
arm
?
"
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Fawn
!
<EOS>
It
often
come
to
pass
that
she
be
awkward
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
less
than
ten
female
sit
round
the
board
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
Lord
Fawn
take
his
place
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
especially
ask
Lucy
to
come
in
to
dinner
,
and
with
Lucy
have
come
the
two
young
girl
.
<EOS>
at
Lord
Fawn
's
right
hand
sit
Lizzie
,
and
Augusta
at
his
left
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
Amelia
on
one
side
and
Lucy
on
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
so
Mr.
Greystock
be
here
to
-
day
,
"
Lady
Fawn
whisper
into
Lucy
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
he
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Lucy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
bid
him
come
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
of
that
,
my
dear
;
 
but
 
<EOS>
but
 
"
then
there
be
no
more
to
be
say
on
that
subject
on
that
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
whole
of
the
dinner
the
conversation
be
keep
up
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
by
Lizzie
talk
to
Augusta
across
her
lover
.
<EOS>
this
be
do
in
such
a
manner
as
to
seem
to
include
Lord
Fawn
in
every
topic
discuss
.
<EOS>
Parliament
,
India
,
the
Sawab
,
Ireland
,
the
special
privilege
of
the
House
of
Lords
,
the
ease
of
a
bachelor
life
,
and
the
delight
of
have
at
his
elbow
just
such
a
rural
retreat
as
Fawn
Court
,
 
<EOS>
these
be
the
fruitful
theme
of
Lizzie
's
eloquence
.
<EOS>
Augusta
do
her
part
at
any
rate
with
patience
;
and
as
for
Lizzie
herself
,
she
work
with
that
superhuman
energy
which
woman
can
so
often
display
in
make
conversation
under
unfavourable
circumstance
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
be
unfavourable
,
for
Lord
Fawn
himself
would
hardly
open
his
mouth
;
but
Lizzie
persevere
,
and
the
hour
of
dinner
pass
over
without
any
show
of
ill
-
humour
,
or
of
sullen
silence
.
<EOS>
when
the
hour
be
over
,
Lord
Fawn
leave
the
room
with
the
lady
,
and
be
soon
closet
with
his
mother
,
while
the
girl
stroll
out
upon
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
Would
Lizzie
play
croquet
?
<EOS>
no
;
Lizzie
would
not
play
croquet
.
<EOS>
She
think
it
probable
that
she
may
catch
her
lover
and
force
him
to
walk
with
her
through
the
shrubbery
;
but
Lord
Fawn
be
not
see
upon
the
lawn
that
evening
,
and
Lizzie
be
force
to
content
herself
with
Augusta
as
a
companion
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
however
,
her
lover
do
say
a
word
to
her
in
private
.
"
<EOS>
give
me
ten
minute
to
-
morrow
between
breakfast
and
church
,
Lizzie
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
promise
that
she
would
do
so
,
smile
sweetly
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
little
music
,
and
then
Lord
Fawn
retire
to
his
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
he
go
to
say
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
ask
Augusta
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
there
exist
in
her
bosom
a
sort
of
craving
after
confidential
friendship
,
 
but
with
it
there
exist
something
that
be
altogether
incompatible
with
confidence
.
<EOS>
She
thoroughly
despise
Augusta
Fawn
,
and
yet
would
have
be
willing
,
 
in
want
of
a
well
friend
,
 
to
press
Augusta
to
her
bosom
,
and
swear
that
there
should
ever
be
between
them
the
tender
friendship
.
<EOS>
She
desire
to
be
the
possessor
of
the
outward
show
of
all
those
thing
of
which
the
inward
fact
be
value
by
the
good
and
steadfast
one
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
She
know
what
be
the
aspiration
,
 
what
the
ambition
,
of
an
honest
woman
;
and
she
know
,
too
,
how
rich
be
the
probable
reward
of
such
honesty
.
<EOS>
true
love
,
true
friendship
,
true
benevolence
,
true
tenderness
,
be
beautiful
to
her
,
 
quality
on
which
she
could
descant
almost
with
eloquence
;
and
therefore
she
be
always
sham
love
and
friendship
and
benevolence
and
tenderness
.
<EOS>
She
could
tell
you
,
with
word
most
appropriate
to
the
subject
,
how
horrible
be
all
sham
,
and
in
say
so
would
be
not
altogether
insincere
;
 
yet
she
know
that
she
herself
be
ever
sham
,
and
she
satisfy
herself
with
sham
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
he
go
to
say
to
me

It

since

one
Sunday
she

I

just
at

the

urge
you
upon

what
I

this

You

pause
for
some
second

he

<EOS>
as
she

he
continue

It
would
not

because
I

such
a

then
I
must
declare

now
Lord

very
slowly

I
must
declare

round
upon
him

I
mean

more
clearly

nothing

<EOS>
Lord

who
have

deal
upon

subject

have
well
understand
that
this
interview
would
be
for
him
one
of
great
difficulty
,
be
very
anxious
to
induce
her
to
listen
to
a
few
further
word
of
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
dear
Lizzie
 
<EOS>
"
he
begin

<EOS>
"
I
will

"
understand

<EOS>
You
understand
nothing
yourself
that
a
man
ought
to
understand

<EOS>
I
wonder
that
you
have
the
courage
to
be
so
insolent
.
<EOS>
if
you
know
what
you
be
do
,
you
would
not
have
the
spirit
to
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
word
do
not
quite
come
home
to
him
,
and
much
of
her
scorn
be
lose
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
chiefly
anxious
to
explain
to
her
that
though
he
must
abide
by
the
threat
he
have
make
,
he
be
quite
willing
to
go
on
with
his
engagement
if
she
would
oblige
him
in
the
matter
of
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
necessary
that
I
should
explain
to
you
that
I
could
not
allow
that
necklace
to
be
bring
into
my
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
one
thought
of
take
it
to
your
house

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
to
do
with
it
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
keep
it
in
my
own
,
"
say
Lizzie
stoutly
.
<EOS>
They
be
still
walk
together
,
and
be
now
altogether
out
of
sight
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
in
her
excitement
have
forget
church
,
have
forget
the
Fawn
woman
,
 
have
forget
everything
except
the
battle
which
it
be
necessary
that
she
should
fight
for
herself
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
mean
to
allow
the
marriage
to
be
break
off
,
 
but
she
mean
to
retain
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
Lord
Fawn
have
demand
its
restitution
,
 
in
which
there
have
be
none
of
that
mock
tenderness
by
which
she
may
have
permit
herself
to
be
persuade
,
 
have
make
her
,
at
any
rate
for
the
moment
,
as
firm
as
steel
on
this
point
.
<EOS>
It
be
inconceivable
to
her
that
he
should
think
himself
at
liberty
to
go
back
from
his
promise
,
because
she
would
not
render
up
property
which
be
in
her
possession
,
and
which
no
one
could
prove
not
to
be
legally
her
own
!
<EOS>
She
walk
on
full
of
fierce
courage
,
 
despise
him
,
but
determine
that
she
would
marry
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
we
do
not
understand
each
other
,
"
he
say
at
last

<EOS>
"
certainly
I
do
not
understand
you
,
sir

"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
my
mother
to
speak
to
you
on
the
subject

<EOS>

no

if
I
tell
your
mother
to
give
up
her
diamond
,
what
would
she
say
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
but

be
not
yours

Lady
Eustace

will
submit
that
question
to
an
arbitrator

<EOS>

I
will
submit
nothing
to
anybody

You
have
no
right
to
speak
on
such
a
subject

after
we
be
married

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
it
settle
first
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
Lord
Fawn
,
you
will
not
have
it
settle
first
.
<EOS>
or
rather
it
be
settle
already
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
my
own
necklace
,
and
Mr.
Camperdown
may
do
anything
he
please

<EOS>
as
for
you

ill

treat
me

I
shall
know
where
to
go
to

They
have
now
come
out
from
the
shrubbery
upon
the
lawn
,
and
there
be
the
carriage
at
the
door
,
ready
to
take
the
elder
of
the
family
to
church

<EOS>
of
course
in
such
a
condition
of
affair
it
would
be
understand
that
Lizzie
be
one
of
the
elder

<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
go
to
church
now
,

she
say
,
as
she
advance
across
the
lawn
towards
the
hall
door
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
pleased
,
Lord
Fawn

to
let
your
mother
know
that
I

.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
that
you
will
dare
to
tell
her
why

"
then
she
sail
round
at
the
back
of
the
carriage

enter
the
hall

several
of

girl
be

on
through
them
all

without

and
march
up
to
her
bed

room

<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frederic

what
be
the
matter
?

ask
Augusta

never

<EOS>
You
have
better

<EOS>
at
this
moment
Lady
Fawn
appear
at
the
bottom
of
the
stair
,
have
pass
Lizzie
as
she
be
come
down
.
<EOS>
not
a
syllable
have
then
be

but
Lady

at
once
know
that
much
be
wrong

<EOS>
Her
son
go
up
to

whisper
a
word
in

ear

"

desist
from

go
away
to

but
he
leave
this
note
for
Lady
Eustace
:
    
<EOS>
DEAREST
LIZZIE
,
  
think
well
of
what
I
have
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
I
desire
to
break
off
our
engagement
;
but
that
I
can
not
allow
my
wife
to
keep
the
diamond
which
belong
of
right
to
her
late
husband
's
family
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
that
I
should
not
be
thus
urgent
<EOS>
have
I
not
take
step
to
ascertain
that
I
be
right
in
my
judgment
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
you
have
well
consult
my
mother

<EOS>
Yours
affectionately

FAWN

<EOS>
"
I

though
of
a
nature
very
different
to

which

<EOS>
Lady

opinion

impropriety

visit
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
come
to
see
his
cousin
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
,
anxious
to
begin
with
some
apology
for
such
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
,
"
say
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
do
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
care
more
to
see
me
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lady
Fawn
be
oblige
to
express
her
opinion
,
and
she
do
so
,
utter
many
word
of
wisdom
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
,
have
he
intend
to
sacrifice
his
prospect
by
a
disinterested
marriage
,
would
have
speak
out
before
now
.
<EOS>
He
be
old
enough
to
have
make
up
his
mind
on
such
a
subject
,
and
he
have
not
speak
out
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
mean
marriage
.
<EOS>
that
be
quite
evident
to
Lady
Fawn
;
 
and
her
dear
Lucy
be
revel
in
hope
which
would
make
her
miserable
.
<EOS>
if
Lucy
could
only
have
know
of
the
letter
,
which
be
already
her
own
property
though
lie
in
the
pillar
letter
-
box
in
Fleet
Street
,
and
which
have
not
already
be
send
down
and
deliver
simply
because
it
be
Sunday
morning
!
<EOS>
but
she
be
very
brave
.
"
<EOS>
He
do
love
me
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
He
tell
me
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Lucy
;
 
<EOS>
that
be
bad
and
bad
.
<EOS>
a
man
to
tell
you
that
he
love
you
,
and
yet
not
ask
you
to
be
his
wife
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
content
,
"
say
Lucy
.
<EOS>
that
assertion
,
however
,
could
hardly
have
be
true
.
  
<EOS>
"
content
!
<EOS>
and
do
you
tell
him
that
you
return
his
love
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
know
it
without
my
tell
him
,
"
say
Lucy
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
hard
upon
her
that
she
should
be
so
interrogated
while
that
letter
be
lie
in
the
iron
box
!
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lucy
,
this
must
not
be
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
prepare
for
yourself
inexpressible
misery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
nothing
wrong
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
;
 
no
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
you
have
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
he
be
wrong
,
 
so
wrong
!
<EOS>
I
call
it
wicked
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
for
your
own
sake
you
should
endeavour
to
forget
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
forget
him
!
"
say
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
to
think
of
him
be
everything
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
I
be
his
Queen
,
and
he
shall
be
my
king
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
loyal
to
him
always
.
"
<EOS>
to
poor
Lady
Fawn
this
be
very
dreadful
.
<EOS>
the
girl
persist
in
declare
her
love
for
the
man
,
and
yet
do
not
even
pretend
to
think
that
the
man
mean
to
marry
her
!
<EOS>
and
this
,
too
,
be
Lucy
Morris
,
 
of
whom
Lady
Fawn
be
accustomed
to
say
to
her
intimate
friend
that
she
have
altogether
cease
to
look
upon
her
as
a
governess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
just
one
of
ourselves
,
Mrs.
Winslow
,
 
and
almost
as
dear
as
one
of
my
own
girl
!
"
<EOS>
thus
,
in
the
warmth
of
her
heart
,
she
have
describe
Lucy
to
a
neighbour
within
the
last
week
.
<EOS>
many
more
word
of
wisdom
she
speak
,
and
then
she
leave
poor
Lucy
in
no
mood
for
church
.
<EOS>
Would
she
have
be
in
a
well
mood
for
the
morning
service
<EOS>
have
she
know
of
the
letter
in
the
iron
post
?
  
<EOS>
then
Lady
Fawn
have
put
on
her
bonnet
and
go
down
into
the
hall
,
and
the
"
rumpus
"
have
come
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
everybody
in
the
house
know
that
all
thing
be
astray
.
<EOS>
when
the
girl
come
home
from
church
,
their
brother
be
go
.
<EOS>
half
an
hour
before
dinner
Lady
Fawn

the
note
up
to
Lizzie
,
with
a
message
to
say
that
they
would
dine
at
three
,
 
it
be
Sunday
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
send
down
word
that
as
she
be
unwell
,
she
would
ask
to
have
just
a
cup
of
tea
and
"
something
"
send
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
if
Lady
Fawn
would
allow
her
,
she
would
remain
up
-
stair
with
her
child
.
<EOS>
She
always
make
use
of
her
child
when
trouble
come
.
  
<EOS>
the
afternoon
be
very
sad
and
dreary
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
an
interview
with
Lady
Eustace
,
but
Lizzie
altogether
refuse
to
listen
to
any
advice
on
the
subject
of
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
affair
,
"
she
say
haughtily
,
"
in
which
I
must
judge
for
myself
,
 
or
with
the
advice
of
my
own
particular
friend
.
<EOS>
have
Lord
Fawn
wait
until
we
be
married
;
then
indeed
 
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
that
would
have
be
too
late
,
"
say
Lady

severely
.
  
<EOS>
"
He

at
any
rate
,
premature
now
in
lay
his
command
upon
me
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
who
be
perhaps
more
anxious
that
the
marriage
should
be
break
off
than
that
the
jewel
should
be
restore
,
then
withdraw
;
and
as
she
leave
the
room
Lizzie
clasp
her
boy
to
her
bosom
.
"
<EOS>
He

<EOS>
She

to
sit
down
,
but

She

<EOS>
She

"
Thereupon
Lucy
rise
from

seat
,
and
retire
with
her
treasure
into
the
book

room
.
<EOS>
but
even
when
she
be
there
she
could
not
at
once
read
her
letter
.
<EOS>
when
the
door
be
close
and
she
know
that
she
be
alone
<EOS>
she
look
at
it
,
and
then
clasp
it
tight
between
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
be
almost
afraid
to
read
it
lest
the
letter
itself
should
contradict
the
promise
which
the
last
word
of
it
have
seem
to
convey
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
go
up
to
the
window
and
stand
there
gaze
out
upon

letter
press
upon
her

.
<EOS>
Lady

have
tell
her
that
she
be
prepare
for
herself
inexpressible
misery
;
 
and
now
there
have
come
to
her
joy
so
absolutely
inexpressible
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
man
to
tell
you
that
he
love
you
,
and
yet
not
ask
you
to
be
his
wife
!
"
<EOS>
She
repeat
to
herself
Lady
Fawn
's
word
,
 
and
then
those
other
word
,
"
yours
ever
and
always
,
if
you
will
have

"
<EOS>
have
him
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
She
throw
from
her
,
at
once
,
as
vain
and
wicked
and
false
,
all
idea
of
coye
her
love
.
<EOS>
She
would
leap
at
his
neck
if
he
be
there
,
and
tell
him
that
for
year
he
have
be
almost
her
god
.
<EOS>
and
of
course
he
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
will
have
him

<EOS>
traitor
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
to
herself
,
smile
through
her
tear
.
<EOS>
then
she
reflect
that
after
all
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
condition
;
 
though
what
condition
could
he
propose
with
which
she
would
not
comply
?
<EOS>
however
,
she
seat
herself
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
do
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
as
she
read
it
,
she
hardly
understand
it
all
;
 
but
she
understand
what
she
want
to
understand
.
<EOS>
He
ask
her
to
share
with
him
his
home
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
to
her
that
day
without
forethought
;
 
but
must
not
such
speech
be
the
true
and
the
sweetest
of
all
speech
?
"
<EOS>
and
now
I
write
to
you
to
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
how
wrong
some
people
can
be
in
their
judgment

<EOS>
how
wrong

<EOS>
for

"
<EOS>
"
and
so
have
I

say
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
have
I

with
that
and
no
other

"
<EOS>
"
too
great
confidence

<EOS>
traitor

"
she
say
again
,
smile
and
weep
,
"
yes

when
of
course

be
his
happiness
in
my
hand
?
<EOS>
oh
,
 
then
he
shall
be
happy

"
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
will
tell
Lady
Fawn
at
once
;
 
instantly
.
<EOS>

Lady
Fawn

<EOS>
but
yet
she

It
could
not
be
more
of
an
offer
if
he
have
sit
write
it
for
ever
,
"
say
Lucy
as
she
give
up
her
letter
with
confidence
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
read
it
with
leisurely
attention
,
and
smile
as
she
put
the
paper
back
into
the
envelope
.
<EOS>
"
all
the
man
in
the
world
could
not
say
it
more
plainly
,
"
say
Lucy
,
nod
her
head
forward
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
they
could
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
read
anything
plainer
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
joy
with
all
my
heart
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
word
to
be
say
against
him
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
against
him
!
"
say
Lucy
,
who
think
that
this
be
very
insufficient
praise
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
mean
be
,
that
when
I
object
to
his
coming
here
<EOS>
I
be
only
afraid
that
he
could
not
afford
,
 
or
would
think
,
you
know
,
that
in
his
position
he
could
not
afford
to
marry
a
wife
without
a
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
come
now
,
Lady
Fawn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
 
yes
;
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
just
to
say
a
word
to
him
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
be
in
my
hand
,
and
I
do
love
you
so
dearly
,
Lucy
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
that
anything
but
good
should
happen
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
good
,
"
say
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
good
,
and
Mr.
Greystock
will
not
think
you
good
,
if
you
do
not
come
and
eat
your
breakfast
.
"
<EOS>
so
Lucy
be
lead
back
into
the
parlour
,
and
sip
her
tea
and
crunch
her
toast
,
while
Lydia
come
and
stand
over
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
be
from
him
?
"
<EOS>
whisper
Lydia
.
<EOS>
Lucy
again
nod
her
head
while
she
be
crunch
her
toast
.
  
<EOS>
the
fact
that
Mr.
Greystock
have
propose
in
form
to
Lucy
Morris
be
soon
know
to
all
the
family
,
and
the
news
certainly
do
take
away
something
from
the
importance
which
would
otherwise
have
be
attach
to
Lizzie
's
departure
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
same
awe
of
the
ceremony
,
the
same
dread
of
some
scene
,
which
,
but
for
Frank
Greystock
's
letter
,
would
have
exist
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
Lord
Fawn
's
future
matrimonial
prospect
be
to
them
all
an
affair
of
more
moment
than
those
of
Lucy
;
but
Lord
Fawn
himself
have
go
,
and
have
already
quarrel
with
the
lady
before
he
go
.
<EOS>
there
be
at
present
nothing
more
to
be
do
by
them
in
regard
to
Lizzie
,
than
just
to
get
rid
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
Lucy
's
good
fortune
,
so
unexpected
,
and
by
her
so
frankly
own
as
the
very
good
fortune
in
the
world
that
could
have
befall
her
,
give
an
excitement
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
lesson
that
morning
for
Nina
,
and
the
usual
study
of
the
family
be
altogether
interrupted
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
purr
,
and
congratulate
,
and
give
good
advice
,
and
declare
that
any
other
home
for
Lucy
before
her
marriage
would
now
be
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
would
not
do
for
you
to
go
even
to
Clara
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
,
 
who
seem
to
think
that
there
still
may
be
some
delay
before
Frank
Greystock
would
be
ready
for
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
that
he
be
not
rich
;
 
not
for
a
member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
make
a
good
income
,
but
I
have
always
hear
that
he
be
a
little
backward
when
he
begin
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
you
know
,
nobody
nee
be
in
a
hurry
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lucy
begin
to
think
that
if
Frank
should
wish
to
postpone
his
marriage
,
 
say
for
three
or
four
year
,
 
she
may
even
yet
become
a
burthen
on
her
friend
.
"
<EOS>
but
do
not
you
be
frightened
,
"
continue
Lady
Fawn
;
"
you
shall
never
want
a
home
as
long
as
I
have
one
to
give
you
.
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
find
out
what
be
Mr.
Greystock
's
idea
;
and
unless
he
be
very
unreasonable
we
will
make
thing
fit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
there
come
a
message
to
Lucy
from
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
miss
,
Lady
Eustace
will
be
glad
to
see
you
for
a
minute
up
in
her
room
before
she
start
.
"
<EOS>
so
Lucy
be
tear
away
from
the
thought
of
her
own
happiness
,
and
take
up
-
stair
to
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
hear
that
I
be
go
?
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
hear
you
be
to
go
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
hear
why
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
not
deceive
me
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
where
be
I
to
look
for
truth
,
if
not
to
an
old
,
old
friend
like
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
deceive
you
,
Lizzie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
indeed
?
<EOS>
only
that
all
people
do
.
<EOS>
the
world
be
so
false
,
so
material
,
so
worldly
!
<EOS>
one
give
out
one
's
heart
and
get
in
return
nothing
but
dust
and
ashe
,
 
nothing
but
ashe
and
dust
.
<EOS>
oh
,
I
have
be
so
disappointed
in
Lady
Fawn
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
she
be
my
dear
friend
,
"
say
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
!
<EOS>
I
know
that
you
have
work
for
her
like
a
slave
,
and
that
she
give
you
but
a
bare
pittance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
be
more
like
a
mother
to
me
than
anything
else
,
"
say
Lucy
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
you
have
be
tame
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
suit
me
to
be
tame
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
plan
to
be
tame
.
<EOS>
have
you
hear
the
cause
of
the
disagreement
between
Lord
Fawn
and
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
 
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
tell
the
truth
,
Lucy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
tell
me
to
tell
the
truth
?
<EOS>
of
course
I
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
something
about
some
property
which
he
want
you
to
give
back
to
somebody
;
but
I
do
not
know
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
husband
,
Sir
Florian
,
who
understand
me
,
 
whom
I
idolize
,
 
who
seem
to
have
be
make
for
me
,
 
give
me
a
present
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
pleased
to
say
that
he
do
not
approve
of
my
keep
any
gift
from
my
late
lord
.
<EOS>
consider
that
he
intend
to
live
upon
the
wealth
which
Sir
Florian
be
generous
enough
to
bestow
upon
me
,
this
do
seem
to
be
strange
!
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
resent
such
interference
.
<EOS>
Would
not
you
have
resent
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Lucy
,
who
think
that
she
could
bring
herself
to
comply
with
any
request
make
to
her
by
Frank
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
any
woman
who
have
a
spark
of
spirit
would
resent
it
,
and
I
have
resent
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
Lord
Fawn
<EOS>
that
I
will
,
on
no
account
,
part
with
the
rich
present
which
my
adore
Florian
shower
upon
me
in
his
generosity
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
their
richness
that
I
keep
them
,
but
because
they
be
,
for
his
sake
,
so
inexpressibly
dear
to
me
.
<EOS>
if
Lord
Fawn
choose
to
be
jealous
of
a
necklace
,
he
must
be
jealous
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
,
who
have
,
in
truth
,
hear
but
a
small
fragment
of
the
story
,
 
just
so
much
of
it
as
Lydia
have
learn
from
the
discreet
Amelia
,
who
herself
have
but
a
very
hazy
idea
of
the
fact
,
 
do
not
quite
know
how
much
of
the
tale
,
as
it
be
now
tell
to
her
,
may
be
true
and
how
much
false
.
<EOS>
after
a
certain
fashion
she
and
Lizzie
Eustace
call
themselves
friend
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
believe
her
friend
to
be
honest
,
and
be
aware
that
in
some
matter
her
friend
would
condescend
 
to
fib
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
poetry
,
and
romance
,
and
high
feeling
,
have
never
have
the
ring
of
true
soundness
in
Lucy
's
ear
.
<EOS>
but
her
imagination
be
not
strong
enough
to
soar
to
the
altitude
of
the
lie
which
Lizzie
be
now
tell
.
<EOS>
She
do
believe
that
the
property
which
Lizzie
be
call
upon
to
restore
be
hold
to
be
objectionable
by
Lord
Fawn
simply
because
it
have
reach
Lizzie
from
the
hand
of
her
late
husband
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
such
conduct
as
that
?
"
ask
Lady
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
will
not
it
do
if
you
lock
them
up
instead
of
wear
them

ask
Lucy

"
I
have
never
dream

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

about
such
thing

say
Lucy
,
determine
not

impute
any
blame
to
one
of
the
Fawn
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
tyranny

sheer
tyranny

continue
the
other

and
he
will
find
that
I

to
it

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
for
love
I
could
give
up
everything

nothing

He
have
tell

many

a

why

It

so
badly

off

wicked

so
say
,
she
leave

give
her

no
time
for
further
argument

<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
get
away
that
morning
,
not
in
time
,
indeed
,
for
the
11.30
train
,
but
at
such
an
hour
as
to
make
it
unnecessary
that
she
should
appear
at
the
early
dinner
.
<EOS>
the
saying
of
farewell
be
very
cold
and
ceremonious
.
<EOS>
of
course

there
be
no
word
as

any
future
visit
,
 
<EOS>
no
word
as

event
<EOS>
whatever

They
all
shake
hand
with
her

special
injunction
be
give
to
the
coachman
to
drive
her
safely
to
the
station

at
this
ceremony
Lucy

have
ask

down

good

I
see
her

be
it
all
very
affectionate

Lydia
ask

well
 
no

it

not
affectionate

all

this
be
all
that
Lucy

thus
Lady

complete
her
visit
to
Fawn
Court

the
letter
be
take
away
for
the
post
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening

before
that
time
it

necessary

should
write
to

lover

whisper

certainly

better

I
should
want
to
see
him
!
"
<EOS>
then
she
write
her
answer
to
Frank
's
letter
.
<EOS>
She
allow
herself
an
hour
for
the
happy
task
;
but
though
the
letter
,
when
write
,
be
short
,
the
hour
hardly
suffice
for
the
writing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
MR
.
GREYSTOCK
;
"
 
there
be
matter
for
her
of
great
consideration
before
she
could
get
even
so
far
as
this
;
but
,
after
bite
her
pen
for
ten
minute
,
during
which
she
picture
to
herself
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
call
him
Frank
when
he
should
have
tell
her
to
do
so
,
and
have
find
,
upon
repeat
whisper
trial
,
that
of
all
name
it
be
the
pleasantest
to
pronounce
<EOS>
,
she
decide
upon
refrain
from
write
it
now
    
Lady
Fawn
have
see
your
letter
to
me
,
 
the
dear
letter
that
ever
be
write
,
 
and
<EOS>
she
say
that
you
may
call
upon
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
go
away
without
see
_
me
too
_
.
  
<EOS>
then
there
be
great
difficulty
as
to
the
word
to
be
use
by
her
for
the
actual
render
herself
up
to
him
as
his
future
wife
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
somewhat
too
spartan
simplicity
of
her
nature
prevail
,
and
the
word
be
write
,
very
plain
and
very
short
.
  
<EOS>
I
love
you
better
than
all
the
world
,
and
I
will
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
the
happiness
of
my
life
to
try
to
deserve
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
,
with
all
my
heart
,
most
affectionately
your
own
  
LUCY
.
  
<EOS>
when
it
be
write
it
do
not
content
her
.
<EOS>
but
the
hour
be
over
,
and
the
letter
must
go
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
will
do
,
"
she
say
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
know
what
it
mean
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
the
letter
be
send
.
   
<EOS>
certainly
an
Heirloom
 
<EOS>
the
burden
of
his
position
be
so
heavy
on
Lord
Fawn
's
mind
that
,
on
the
Monday
morning
after
leave
Fawn
Court
,
he
be
hardly
as
true
to
the
affair
of
India
as
he
himself
would
have
wish
.
<EOS>
He
be
resolve
to
do
what
be
right
,
 
if
only
he
could
find
out
what
would
be
the
right
thing
in
his
present
difficulty
.
<EOS>
not
to
break
his
word
,
not
to
be
unjust
,
not
to
deviate
by
a
hair
's
breadth
from
that
line
of
conduct
which
would
be
describe
as
"
honourable
"
in
the
circle
to
which
he
belong
;
not
to
give
his
political
enemy
an
opportunity
for
calumny
,
 
this
be
all
in
all
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
young
widow
be
very
lovely
and
very
rich
,
and
it
would
have
suit
him
well
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
It
would
still
suit
him
well
to
do
so
,
if
she
would
make
herself
amenable
to
reason
and
the
law
.
<EOS>
He
have
assure
himself
that
he
be
very
much
in
love
with
her
,
and
have
already
,
in
his
imagination
,
receive
the
distinguished
head
of
his
party
at
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
give
all
this
up
,
 
love
,
income
,
beauty
,
and
castle
,
 
without
a
doubt
,
rather
than
find
himself
in
the
mess
of
have
marry
a
wife
who
have
steal
a
necklace
,
and
who
would
not
make
restitution
.
<EOS>
He
may
marry
her
,
and
insist
on
give
it
up
afterwards
;
but
he
foresee
terrible
difficulty
in
the
way
of
such
an
arrangement
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
be
self
-
willed
,
and
have
already
tell
him
that
she
do
not
intend
to
keep
the
jewel
in
his
house
,
 
but
in
her
own
!
<EOS>
what
should
he
do
,
so
that
no
human
being
,
 
not
the
most
bigoted
Tory
that
ever
express
scorn
for
a
Whig
lord
,
 
should
be
able
to
say
that
he
have
do
wrong
?
<EOS>
He
be
engage
to
the
lady
,
and
could
not
simply
change
his
mind
and
give
no
reason
.
<EOS>
He
believe
in
Mr.
Camperdown
;
but
he
could
hardly
plead
that
belief
,
should
he
hereafter
be
accuse
of
heartless
misconduct
.
<EOS>
for
aught
he
know
,
Lady
Eustace
may
bring
an
action
against
him
for
breach
of
promise
,
and
obtain
a
verdict
and
damage
,
and
annihilate
him
as
an
Under
-
Secretary
.
<EOS>
how
should
he
keep
his
hand
quite
clean
?
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
be
,
as
far
as
he
know
,
Lizzie
's
near
relative
in
London
.
<EOS>
the
dean
be
her
uncle
,
but
then
the
dean
be
down
at
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
necessary
for
him
to
go
down
to
Bobsborough
;
 
but
in
the
meantime
he
would
see
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
Greystock
be
as
bitter
a
Tory
as
any
in
England
.
<EOS>
Greystock
be
the
very
man
who
have
attack
him
,
Lord
Fawn
,
in
the
House
of
Commons
respect
the
Sawab
,
 
make
the
attack
quite
personal
,
 
and
that
without
a
shadow
of
a
cause
!
<EOS>
within
the
short
straight
groove
of
Lord
Fawn
's
intellect
the
remembrance
of
this
suppose
wrong
be
always
run
up
and
down
,
renew
its
own
soreness
.
<EOS>
He
regard
Greystock
as
an
enemy
who
would
lose
no
opportunity
of
injure
him
.
<EOS>
in
his
weakness
and
littleness
he
be
quite
unable
to
judge
of
other
man
by
himself
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
go
a
hair
's
breadth
astray
,
if
he
know
it
;
but
because
Greystock
have
,
in
debate
,
call
him
timid
and
tyrannical
,
he
believe
that
Greystock
would
stop
short
of
nothing
that
may
injure
him
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
must
appeal
to
Greystock
.
<EOS>
He
do
appeal
,
and
in
answer
to
his
appeal
<EOS>
Frank
come
to
him
at
the
India
House
.
<EOS>
but
Frank
,
before
he
see
Lord
Fawn
,
have
,
as
be
fitting
,
be
with
his
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
be
decide
at
this
interview
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
become
more
than
ever
convince
that
the
member
for
Bobsborough
be
his
determined
enemy
,
and
Frank
be
more
convinced
than
ever
that
Lord
Fawn
be
an
empty
,
stiff
-
necked
,
self
-
sufficient
prig
.
  
<EOS>
Greystock
,
of
course
,
take
his
cousin
's
part
.
<EOS>
He
be
there
to
do
so
;
and
he
himself
really
do
not
know
whether
Lizzie
be
or
be
not
entitle
to
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
the
lie
which
she
have
first
fabricate
for
the
benefit
of
Mr.
Benjamin
when
she
have
the
jewel
value
,
and
which
she
have
since
tell
with
different
degree
of
precision
to
various
people
,
 
to
Lady
Linlithgow
,
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
to
Lucy
,
and
to
Lord
Fawn
,
 
<EOS>
she
now
repeat
with
increase
precision
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
,
in
put
the
trinket
into
her
hand
,
have
explain
to
her
that
it
be
very
valuable
,
and
that
she
be
to
regard
it
as
her
own
peculiar
property
.
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
an
heirloom
he
could
not
do
it
,
"
Frank
have
say
,
with
all
the
confidence
of
a
practise
barrister
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
make
it
over
as
an
heirloom
to
me
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
with
plaintive
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
nonsense
,
dear
Lizzie
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
smile
sweetly
on
him
,
and
pat
the
back
of
his
hand
with
hers
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
gentle
with
him
,
and
bear
his
assumed
superiority
with
pretty
meekness
.
"
<EOS>
He
could
not
make
it
over
as
an
heirloom
to
you
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
his
to
give
,
he
could
give
it
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
his
,
 
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
what
I
can
not
tell
as
yet
,
and
what
must
be
find
out
.
<EOS>
if
the
diamond
form
part
of
an
heirloom
,
 
and
there
be
evidence
that
it
be
so
,
 
you
must
give
them
up
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
could
only
give
away
what
be
his
own
to
give
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
Lord
Fawn
have
no
right
to
dictate
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
not
,
"
say
Frank
;
and
then
he
make
a
promise
,
which
he
know
to
be
rash
,
that
he
would
stand
by
his
pretty
cousin
in
this
affair
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
why
you
should
assume
that
Lady
Eustace
be
keep
property
that
do
not
belong
to
her
,
"
he
say
to
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
go
by
what
Camperdown
tell
me
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Camperdown
be
a
very
excellent
attorney
,
and
a
most
respectable
man
,
"
say
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
on
earth
to
say
against
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Camperdown
be
not
the
law
and
the
prophet
,
nor
yet
can
we
allow
him
to
be
judge
and
jury
in
such
a
case
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
surely
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
you
would
not
wish
it
to
go
before
a
jury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
understand
me
,
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
if
any
claim
be
really
make
for
these
jewel
by
Mr.
John
Eustace
on
the
part
of
the
heir
,
or
on
behalf
of
the
estate
,
a
statement
have
better
be
submit
to
counsel
.
<EOS>
the
family
deed
must
be
inspect
,
and
no
doubt
counsel
would
agree
in
tell
my
cousin
,
Lady
Eustace
,
what
she
should
,
or
what
she
should
not
do
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
I
understand
that
you
be
engage
to
marry
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
engage
to
her
,
certainly
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
hardly
mean
to
assert
,
my
lord
,
that
you
intend
to
be
untrue
to
your
promise
,
and
to
throw
over
your
own
engagement
because
my
cousin
have
express
her
wish
to
retain
property
which
she
believe
to
be
her
own
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
be
say
in
a
tone
which
make
Lord
Fawn
sure
than
ever
that
Greystock
be
his
enemy
to
the
knife
.
<EOS>
personally
,
he
be
not
a
coward
;
and
he
know
enough
of
the
world
to
be
quite
sure
that
Greystock
would
not
attempt
any
personal
encounter
.
<EOS>
but
morally
,
Lord
Fawn
be
a
coward
,
and
he
do
fear
that
the
man
before
him
would
work
him
some
bitter
injury
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
mean
that
,
"
continue
Frank
,
"
and
you
will
probably
allow
me
to
assure
my
cousin
that
she
misunderstand
you
in
the
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
sooner
see
Mr.
Camperdown
again
before
I
say
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
understand
,
Lord
Fawn
,
that
a
gentleman
should
require
an
attorney
to
tell
him
what
to
do
in
such
a
case
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
stand
now
,
and
Lord
Fawn
's
countenance
be
heavy
,
troubled
,
and
full
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
,
and
be
probably
altogether
unaware
how
eloquent
be
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
,
Lady
Eustace
,
"
continue
Frank
,
"
must
not
be
keep
in
this
suspense
.
<EOS>
I
agree
on
her
behalf
that
her
title
to
these
trinket
must
be
make
the
subject
of
inquiry
by
person
adequate
to
form
a
judgment
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
,
as
her
relative
,
shall
take
no
part
in
that
inquiry
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
her
relative
,
I
must
demand
from
you
an
admission
that
your
engagement
with
her
can
not
in
any
way
be
allow
to
depend
on
the
fate
of
those
jewel
.
<EOS>
She
have
choose
to
accept
you
as
her
future
husband
,
and
I
be
bind
to
see
that
she
be
treat
with
good
faith
,
honour
,
and
fair
observance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
make
his
demand
very
well
,
while
Lord
Fawn
be
look
like
a
whip
dog
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
say
his
lordship
,
"
all
I
want
be
,
that
the
right
thing
should
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
right
thing
will
be
do
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
wish
to
keep
nothing
that
be
not
her
own
.
<EOS>
I
may
tell
her
,
then
,
that
she
will
receive
from
you
an
assurance
that
you
have
have
no
intention
of
depart
from
your
word
?
"
<EOS>
after
this
,
Lord
Fawn
make
some
attempt
at
a
stipulation
that
this
assurance
to
Lizzie
be
to
be
found
on
the
counter
-
assurance
give
to
him
that
the
matter
of
the
diamond
should
be
decide
by
proper
legal
authority
;
but
Frank
would
not
submit
to
this
,
and
at
last
the
Under
-
Secretary
yield
.
<EOS>
the
engagement
be
to
remain
in
force
.
<EOS>
counsel
be
to
be
employ
.
<EOS>
the
two
lover
be
not
to
see
each
other
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
and
when
the
matter
have
be
decide
by
the
lawyer
,
Lord
Fawn
be
to
express
his
regret
for
have
suspect
his
lady
-
love
!
<EOS>
that
be
the
verbal
agreement
,
accord
to
Frank
Greystock
's
view
of
it
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
no
doubt
,
would
have
declare
that
he
have
never
consent
to
the
latter
stipulation
.
  
<EOS>
about
a
week
after
this
there
be
a
meeting
at
Mr.
Camperdown
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
Greystock
,
as
his
cousin
's
friend
,
attend
to
hear
what
Mr.
Camperdown
have
to
say
in
the
presence
of
Lord
Fawn
and
John
Eustace
.
<EOS>
He
,
Frank
,
have
,
in
the
meantime
,
be
down
to
Richmond
,
have
take
Lucy
to
his
arm
as
his
future
bride
,
and
have
be
closet
with
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
as
a
man
who
be
do
his
duty
by
Lucy
Morris
,
he
be
welcome
and
make
much
of
by
her
ladyship
;
but
it
have
be
impossible
to
leave
Lizzie
's
name
altogether
unmentioned
,
and
Frank
have
speak
as
the
champion
of
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
of
course
there
have
arise
something
of
ill
-
feeling
between
the
two
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
teach
herself
to
hate
Lizzie
,
and
be
desirous
that
the
match
should
be
over
,
diamond
or
no
diamond
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
quite
say
this
to
her
visitor
,
but
she
show
her
feel
very
plainly
.
<EOS>
Frank
be
courteous
,
cold
,
and
resolute
in
presuming
,
or
pretend
to
presume
,
that
as
a
matter
of
course
the
marriage
would
take
place
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
intend
to
be
civil
,
but
she
could
not
restrain
her
feeling
;
and
though
she
do
not
dare
to
say
that
her
son
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
Lizzie
Eustace
,
she
show
very
plainly
that
she
intend
to
work
with
that
object
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
the
two
do
not
part
as
cordial
friend
,
and
of
course
poor
Lucy
perceive
that
it
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
before
the
meeting
take
place
,
Mr.
Camperdown
have
be
at
work
,
look
over
old
deed
.
<EOS>
It
be
undoubtedly
the
case
that
thing
often
become
complicated
which
,
from
the
greatness
of
their
importance
,
should
have
be
keep
clear
as
running
water
.
<EOS>
the
diamond
in
question
have
be
buy
,
with
other
jewel
,
by
Sir
Florian
's
grandfather
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
a
certain
duke
,
 
on
which
occasion
old
family
jewel
,
which
be
say
to
have
be
heirloom
,
be
sell
or
give
in
exchange
as
part
value
for
those
then
purchase
.
<EOS>
this
grandfather
,
who
have
also
be
Sir
Florian
in
his
time
,
have
expressly
state
in
his
will
that
these
jewel
be
to
be
regard
as
an
heirloom
in
the
family
,
and
have
as
such
leave
them
to
his
eld
son
,
and
to
that
son
's
eld
son
,
should
such
a
child
be
bear
.
<EOS>
His
eld
son
have
possess
them
,
but
not
that
son
's
son
.
<EOS>
there
be
such
an
Eustace
bear
,
but
he
have
die
before
his
father
.
<EOS>
the
young
son
of
that
old
Sir
Florian
have
then
succeed
,
as
Sir
Thomas
,
and
he
be
the
father
of
that
Florian
who
have
marry
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
that
last
Sir
Florian
have
therefore
be
the
fourth
in
succession
from
the
old
Sir
Florian
by
whom
the
will
have
be
make
,
and
who
have
direct
that
these
jewel
should
be
regard
as
heirloom
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
the
two
intermediate
baronet
have
make
no
allusion
to
the
diamond
in
any
deed
execute
by
them
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Sir
Florian
's
father
have
die
without
a
will
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
jewel
,
large
but
much
less
valuable
than
the
diamond
,
still
in
the
hand
of
the
Messrs.
Garnett
,
as
to
which
no
question
be
raise
.
<EOS>
the
late
Sir
Florian
have
,
by
his
will
,
leave
all
the
property
in
his
house
at
Portray
to
his
widow
,
but
all
property
elsewhere
to
his
heir
.
<EOS>
this
be
what
Mr.
Camperdown
have
at
last
learn
,
but
he
have
be
force
to
admit
to
himself
,
while
learn
this
,
that
there
be
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
confident
enough
,
however
,
that
there
be
no
difficulty
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
the
Messrs.
Garnett
be
able
to
say
that
the
necklace
have
be
in
their
keeping
,
with
various
other
jewel
still
in
their
possession
,
from
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
late
Lady
Eustace
,
up
to
the
marriage
of
the
late
Sir
Florian
,
her
son
.
<EOS>
They
state
the
date
on
which
the
jewel
be
give
up
to
be
the
24th
of
September
,
which
be
the
day
after
Sir
Florian
's
return
from
Scotland
with
his
bride
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
first
statement
have
coincide
with
this
entry
in
the
Messrs.
Garnett
's
book
;
but
latterly
she
have
assert
that
the
necklace
have
be
give
to
her
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Camperdown
examine
the
entry
himself
in
the
jeweller
"
book
,
he
find
the
figure
to
be
so
blot
that
they
may
represent
either
the
4th
or
24th
September
.
<EOS>
now
,
the
4th
September
have
be
the
day
precede
Sir
Florian
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
only
know
that
he
have
see
the
necklace
wear
in
Scotland
by
his
mother
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
only
know
that
he
have
often
see
them
on
the
neck
of
his
sister
-
in
-
law
when
,
as
be
very
often
the
case
,
she
appear
in
full
-
blow
society
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
believe
that
he
have
trace
two
story
to
Lizzie
,
 
one
,
repeat
more
than
once
,
that
the
diamond
have
be
give
to
her
in
London
,
and
a
second
,
make
to
himself
,
that
they
have
be
give
to
her
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
He
himself
believe
that
they
have
never
be
in
Scotland
since
the
death
of
the
former
Lady
Eustace
;
but
he
be
quite
confident
that
he
could
trust
altogether
to
the
disposition
make
of
them
by
the
old
Sir
Florian
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
these
be
the
diamond
there
describe
,
although
the
setting
have
be
alter
.
<EOS>
old
Mr.
Garnett
state
that
he
would
swear
to
them
if
he
see
the
necklace
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
suppose
that
Lady
Eustace
wish
to
keep
anything
that
be
not
her
own
,
"
say
Frank
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
not
,
"
say
John
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
imagine
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
who
feel
that
he
ought
not
to
be
there
,
and
who
do
not
know
whether
he
may
with
a
well
grace
take
Lizzie
's
part
or
a
part
against
her
,
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
continue
Mr.
Camperdown
,
"
there
be
luckily
no
doubt
as
to
the
fact
.
<EOS>
the
diamond
in
question
form
a
part
of
a
set
of
most
valuable
ornament
settle
in
the
family
by
Sir
Florian
Eustace
in
1799
.
<EOS>
the
deed
be
draw
up
by
my
grandfather
,
and
be
now
here
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
we
be
to
have
further
proof
.
<EOS>
Will
you
look
at
the
deed
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
and
at
the
will
?
"
<EOS>
Frank
suggest
that
,
as
it
may
probably
be
expedient
to
take
advice
on
the
subject
professionally
,
he
have
rather
not
look
at
the
deed
.
<EOS>
anything
which
he
may
say
,
on
look
at
the
document
now
,
could
have
no
weight
.
<EOS>
"
but
why
should
any
advice
be
necessary
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
,
"
when
the
matter
be
so
clear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
"
say
Frank
,
"
<EOS>
my
cousin
,
Lady
Eustace
,
be
strong
in
her
confidence
that
her
late
husband
intend
to
give
them
to
her
as
her
own
,
and
that
he
would
not
have
do
this
without
the
power
of
do
so
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
Mr.
Camperdown
be
quite
sure
that
Lizzie
be
lie
in
this
,
and
could
therefore
make
no
adequate
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Your
experience
must
probably
have
tell
you
,
"
continue
Frank
,
"
that
there
be
considerable
difficulty
in
deal
with
the
matter
of
heirloom
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
of
any
such
difficulty
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
.
  
<EOS>
"
People
generally
understand
it
all
so
clearly
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
late
Sir
Florian
do
not
appear
to
have
understand
it
very
clearly
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
her
put
them
into
the
hand
of
any
indifferent
person
or
firm
till
the
matter
be
decide
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
be
much
safe
so
than
in
her
keeping
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
be
quite
safe
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
be
all
that
take
place
at
that
meeting
.
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Camperdown
say
to
John
Eustace
,
it
be
manifest
enough
that
she
mean
"
to
hang
on
to
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
only
hope
Lord
Fawn
will
not
be
fool
enough
to
marry
her
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
himself
be
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
;
 
but
then
how
be
he
to
clear
his
character
of
the
charge
which
would
be
bring
against
him
;
and
how
be
he
to
stand
his
ground
before
Frank
Greystock
?
   
<EOS>
the
diamond
be
see
in
Public
 
<EOS>
let
it
not
be
suppose
that
Lady
Eustace
,
during
these
summer
week
,
be
live
the
life
of
a
recluse
.
<EOS>
the
London
season
be
in
its
full
splendour
,
and
she
be
by
no
mean
a
recluse
.
<EOS>
during
the
first
year
of
her
widowhood
she
have
be
every
inch
a
widow
,
 
as
far
as
crape
would
go
,
and
a
quiet
life
either
at
Bobsborough
or
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
during
this
year
her
child
be
bear
,
 
and
she
be
in
every
way
throw
upon
her
good
behaviour
,
live
with
bishop
"
wife
and
dean
'
daughter
.
<EOS>
two
year
of
retreat
from
the
world
be
generally
think
to
be
the
proper
thing
for
a
widow
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
not
quite
accomplish
her
two
year
before
she
re
-
open
the
campaign
in
Mount
Street
with
very
small
remnant
of
weed
,
and
with
her
crape
bring
down
to
a
minimum
;
 
but
she
be
young
and
rich
,
and
the
world
be
aware
that
a
woman
of
twenty
-
two
can
hardly
afford
to
sacrifice
two
whole
year
.
<EOS>
in
the
matter
of
her
widowhood
<EOS>
Lizzie
do
not
encounter
very
much
reproach
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
shun
,
or
so
ill
spoken
of
as
to
have
a
widely
-
spread
bad
name
among
the
street
and
square
in
which
her
carriage
-
wheel
roll
.
<EOS>
People
call
her
a
flirt
,
hold
up
their
hand
in
surprise
at
Sir
Florian
's
foolish
generosity
,
 
for
the
account
of
Lizzie
's
wealth
be
greatly
exaggerated
,
 
and
say
that
of
course
she
would
marry
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
general
belief
which
often
seize
upon
the
world
in
regard
to
some
special
falsehood
be
very
surprising
.
<EOS>
everybody
on
a
sudden
adopt
an
idea
that
some
particular
man
be
over
head
and
ear
in
debt
,
so
that
he
can
hardly
leave
his
house
for
fear
of
the
bailiff
;
 
or
that
some
ill
-
fate
woman
be
cruelly
ill
-
use
by
her
husband
;
 
or
that
some
eld
son
have
ruin
his
father
;
whereas
the
man
do
not
owe
a
shilling
,
the
woman
never
hear
a
harsh
word
from
her
lord
,
and
the
eld
son
in
question
have
never
succeed
in
obtain
a
shilling
beyond
his
allowance
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
lie
about
London
this
season
be
found
on
the
extent
of
Lady
Eustace
's
jointure
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
lie
go
on
to
state
that
the
jointure
be
more
than
a
jointure
.
<EOS>
It
be
believe
that
the
property
in
Ayrshire
be
her
own
,
to
do
what
she
please
with
it
.
<EOS>
that
the
property
in
Ayrshire
be
take
<EOS>
at
double
its
value
be
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
declare
,
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
,
that
Sir
Florian
have
be
especially
generous
to
his
penniless
wife
,
and
the
generosity
be
magnify
in
the
ordinary
way
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
Lizzie
's
own
diligence
have
do
much
to
propagate
the
story
as
to
her
positive
ownership
of
Portray
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
have
be
very
busy
deny
this
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
have
deny
it
whenever
occasion
offer
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
in
his
quiet
way
have
deny
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
have
deny
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
lie
have
be
set
on
foot
and
have
thrive
,
and
there
be
hardly
a
man
about
town
who
do
not
know
that
Lady
Eustace
have
eight
or
nine
thousand
a
year
,
altogether
at
her
own
disposal
,
down
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
of
course
a
woman
so
endowed
,
so
rich
,
so
beautiful
,
so
clever
,
so
young
,
would
marry
again
,
and
would
marry
well
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
add
to
this
there
be
a
feeling
that
"
Lizzie
,
"
as
she
be
not
uncommonly
call
by
people
who
have
hardly
ever
see
her
,
have
something
amiss
with
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
where
it
be
she
be
lame
,
"
say
that
very
clever
man
,
Captain
Boodle
,
who
have
lately
reappear
among
his
military
friend
at
his
club
,
"
but
<EOS>
she
do
not
go
flat
all
round
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
the
devil
of
a
temper
,
no
doubt
,
"
say
Lieutenant
Griggs
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
mouth
,
I
should
say
,
"
say
Boodle
.
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
Lizzie
be
talk
about
at
the
club
;
but
she
be
ask
to
dinner
and
ball
,
and
give
little
dinner
herself
,
and
to
a
certain
extent
be
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
everybody
have
declare
that
of
course
she
would
marry
again
,
and
now
it
be
know
everywhere
that
she
be
engage
to
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
dear
Lord
Fawn
!
"
say
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
to
her
dear
friend
Madame
Max
Goesler
;
"
do
you
remember
how
violently
he
be
in
love
with
Violet
Effingham
two
year
ago
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
two
year
be
a
long
time
,
Lady
Glencora
;
and
Violet
Effingham
have
choose
another
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
be
not
this
a
fall
for
him
?
<EOS>
Violet
be
the
sweetest
girl
out
,
and
at
one
time
I
really
think
she
mean
to
take
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
mean
to
take
another
man
whom
she
do
not
take
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
,
who
have
her
own
recollection
,
who
be
a
widow
herself
,
and
who
,
at
the
period
to
which
Lady
Glencora
be
refer
,
have
think
that
perhaps
she
may
cease
to
be
a
widow
.
<EOS>
not
that
she
have
ever
suggest
to
herself
that
Lord
Fawn
may
be
her
second
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Lord
Fawn
!
"
<EOS>
continue
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
be
terribly
in
want
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
surely
Lady
Eustace
be
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
she
be
very
pretty
;
nay
more
,
she
be
quite
lovely
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
clever
,
 
very
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
rich
,
 
very
.
<EOS>
but
 
"
  
"
well
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
what
do
your
"
but
"
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
ever
explain
a

?
<EOS>
You
be
a
great
deal
too
clever
,
Madame
Goesler
,
to
want
any
explanation
.
<EOS>
and
I
could
not
explain
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
I
be
sorry
for
poor
Lord
Fawn
,
 
who
be
a
gentleman
,
but
will
never
set
the
Thames
on
fire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

indeed
.
<EOS>
all
the
same
,
I
like
Lord
Fawn
extremely
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
he

the

this
statement
be
by
no

an
accurate
history

progress

<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed

absolutely
false

it
suffice
to
show
that
the
matter
be
become
public

"
You
do
not

off

I
do

poor

Lord

badly

it
be

to
believe

get
the
fine
diamond

steal

I

if

do

money
he
should
have
the
money

<EOS>
Lady

in

Lady

Madame

there
be
,
therefore

something
more

Mr.

upon

<EOS>
"
the
work
go
on
at

office

that
be
all
I
know
about
Fawn

<EOS>
He
have
not
tell
me

therefore
I

He

not

it
official

<EOS>
"
the
paper

Mr.

when

do
they
will
be
very
awkward
paper

far

I
hear

Barrington
Erle

<EOS>
"
there
be
no
doubt
they
be
engage

I

no

that
he
have
declare
off

and
refuse
to
give
any
reason

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
money
be
not
all
there

"
suggest
Mr.
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
queer
story
go
about

to
some
diamond

no
one
know
whom
they
belong

they
say
that
Fawn

accuse

steal
them

<EOS>
He
want
to
get
hold
of
them
,
and
she
will
not
give
them
up
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
lawyer
be
to
have
a
shy
at
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
Fawn
.
<EOS>
It
will
do
him
a
deal
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
he
will
not
come
out
much
amiss
,
"
say
Mr.
Legge
Wilson
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
as
cautious
a
man
as
there
be
in
London

if
there
be
anything
wrong
 
"
  
"
there
be
a
great
deal
wrong

Barrington

<EOS>
"
You
will
find
it
will
be
on
her
side

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
find
also
that
she
will
contrive
that
all
the
blame
shall
lie
upon
him

<EOS>
She
be
clever
enough
for
anything

<EOS>
who
be
to
be
the
new
bishop

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
hear
Gresham
say
as
yet

Jones

I
should
think

Mr.

<EOS>
"
and
who
be
Jones

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
clergyman

I
suppose

of
the
safe
sort

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
anything
else
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
from
which
it
will
be
see
that
Mr.
Wilson
have
his
own
opinion
about
church
matter
,
and
also
that
people
very
high
up
in
the
world
be
concern
themselves
about
poor
Lizzie
's
affair
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
do
go
to
Lady
Glencora
's
evening
party
,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Camperdown
and
all
her
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Lady
Chiltern
have
be
quite
right
in
say
that
Lizzie
be
not
the
woman
to
show
the
white
feather
.
<EOS>
She
go
,
know
that
she
would
meet
Lord
Fawn
,
and
she
do
wear
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
that
they
have
be
round
her
neck
since
the
occasion
in
respect
to
which
Sir
Florian
have
place
them
in
her
hand
,
and
it
have
not
be
without
much
screw
up
of
her
courage
that
she
have
resolve
to
appear
on
this
occasion
with
the
much
-
talk
-
of
ornament
upon
her
person
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
something
over
a
fortnight
since
she
have
part
with
Lord
Fawn
at
Fawn
Court
;
and
,
although
they
be
still
presume
to
be
engage
to
marry
each
other
,
and
be
both
live
in
London
,
she
have
not
see
him
since
.
<EOS>
a
sort
of
message
have
reach
her
,
through
Frank
Greystock
,
to
the
effect
that
Lord
Fawn
think
it
as
well
that
they
should
not
meet
till
the
matter
be
settle
.
<EOS>
stipulation
have
be
make
by
Frank
on
her
behalf
,
and
this
have
be
insert
among
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
receive
the
message
with
scorn
,
 
with
a
mixture
of
scorn
and
gratitude
,
 
of
scorn
in
regard
to
the
man
who
have
promise
to
marry
her
,
and
of
affectionate
gratitude
to
the
cousin
who
have
make
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
shall
not
wish
to
see
him
while
he
choose
to
entertain
such
an
idea
,
"
she
have
say
,
"
but
I
shall
not
keep
out
of
his
way
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
wish
me
to
keep
out
of
his
way
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
"
when
she
receive
a
card
for
Lady
Glencora
's
party
,
very
soon
after
this
,
she
be
careful
to
answer
it
in
such
a
manner
as
to
impress
Lady
Glencora
with
a
remembrance
of
her
assent
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
would
probably
be
there
,
 
unless
he
remain
away
in
order
to
avoid
her
.
<EOS>
then
she
have
ten
day
in
which
to
make
up
her
mind
as
to
wear
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
Her
courage
be
good
;
but
then
her
ignorance
be
so
great
!
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
whether
Mr.
Camperdown
may
not
contrive
to
have
them
take
by
violence
from
her
neck
,
even
on
Lady
Glencora
's
stair
.
<EOS>
Her
good
security
,
 
<EOS>
so
she
think
,
 
would
be
in
the
fact
that
Mr.
Camperdown
would
not
know
of
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
tell
no
one
,
 
not
even
Miss
Macnulty
;
but
she
appear
before
that
lady
,
array
in
all
her
glory
,
just
as
she
be
about
to
descend
to
her
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
get
the
necklace
on
!
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
not
wear
my
own
necklace
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
,
with
assumed
anger
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
room
be
already
very
full
when
Lizzie
enter
them
,
but
she
be
without
a
gentleman
,
and
room
be
make
for
her
to
pass
quickly
up
the
stair
.
<EOS>
the
diamond
have
be
recognise
by
many
before
she
have
reach
the
drawing
-
room
;
 
not
that
these
very
diamond
be
know
,
or
that
there
be
a
special
memory
for
that
necklace
;
 
but
the
subject
have
be
so
generally
discuss
,
that
the
blaze
of
the
stone
immediately
bring
it
to
the
mind
of
man
and
woman
.
<EOS>
"
there
she
be
,
with
poor
Eustace
's
twenty
thousand
pound
round
her
neck
,
"
say
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
to
his
friend
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
there
be
Lord
Fawn
go
to
look
after
them
,
"
reply
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
think
it
right
,
at
any
rate
,
to
look
after
his
bride
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
whisper
into
his
ear
before
they
go
down
to
dinner
that
Lady
Eustace
would
be
there
in
the
evening
,
so
that
he
may
have
the
option
of
escape
or
remain
.
<EOS>
Could
he
have
escape
without
any
one
know
that
he
have
escape
,
he
would
not
have
go
up
-
stair
after
dinner
;
but
he
know
that
he
be
observe
;
he
know
that
people
be
talk
about
him
;
and
he
do
not
like
it
to
be
say
that
he
have
run
away
.
<EOS>
He
go
up
,
think
much
of
it
all
,
and
as
soon
as
he
see
Lady
Eustace
he
make
his
way
to
her
and
accost
her
.
<EOS>
many
eye
be
upon
them
,
but
no
ear
probably
hear
how
infinitely
unimportant
be
the
word
which
they
speak
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
excellent
.
<EOS>
She
smile
and
give
him
her
hand
,
 
just
her
hand
without
the
slight
pressure
,
 
and
speak
a
half
-
whisper
word
,
look
into
his
face
,
but
betray
nothing
by
her
look
.
<EOS>
then
he
ask
her
whether
she
would
dance
.
<EOS>
yes
;
 
she
would
stand
up
for
a
quadrille
;
and
they
do
stand
up
for
a
quadrille
.
<EOS>
as
she
dance
with
no
one
else
,
it
be
clear
that
she
treat
Lord
Fawn
as
her
lover
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
dance
be
do
she
take
his
arm
and
move
for
a
few
minute
about
the
room
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
conscious
of
the
diamond
,
but
she
do
not
show
the
feeling
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
He
also
be
conscious
of
them
,
and
he
do
show
it
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
recognise
the
necklace
,
but
he
know
well
that
this
be
the
very
bone
of
contention
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
beautiful
,
and
seem
to
him
to
outshine
all
other
jewellery
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
and
Lady
Eustace
be
a
woman
of
whom
it
may
almost
be
say
that
she
ought
to
wear
diamond
.
<EOS>
She
be
make
to
sparkle
,
to
be
bright
with
outside
garniture
,
 
to
shine
and
glitter
,
and
be
rich
in
apparel
.
<EOS>
the
only
doubt
may
be
whether
paste
diamond
may
not
better
suit
her
character
.
<EOS>
but
these
be
not
paste
,
and
she
do
shine
and
glitter
and
be
very
rich
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
bring
as
an
accusation
against
Lady
Glencora
's
guest
that
they
press
round
to
look
at
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
guest
know
better
than
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
some
slight
ferment
,
 
slight
,
but
still
feel
both

upon

and
there
be

here
and
there

<EOS>
Lizzie
bear
it
very
well
;
but
Lord
Fawn
be
uncomfortable
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
her
for

them

"
say
Lady
Glencora
to
Lady
Chiltern

<EOS>
"
yes

if
she
mean
to
keep
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
,
however
,
to
know
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
You
see
the
match
be
not
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
I
do
?
<EOS>
He
dine
here
,
you
know
,
and
,
before
go
down
-
stair
,
I
tell
him
that
she
be
come
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
only
fair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
care
that
he
should
not
have
to
say
anything
;
but
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
do
not
expect
him
to
come
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
can
not
be
any
quarrel
at
all
,
"
say
Lady
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
sure
of
that
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
not
so
very
loving
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
make
the
most
of
her
opportunity
.
<EOS>
soon
after
the
quadrille
be
over
she
ask
Lord
Fawn
to
get
her
carriage
for
her
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
get
it
,
and
of
course
he
put
her
into
it
,
pass
up
and
down
-
stair
twice
in
his
effort
on
her
behalf
.
<EOS>
and
of
course
all
the
world
see
what
he
be
do
.
<EOS>
up
to
the
last
moment
not
a
word
have
be
speak
between
them
that
may
not
have
pass
between
the
most
ordinary
acquaintance
,
but
,
as
she
take
her
seat
,
she
put
her
face
forward
and
do
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
come
to
me
soon
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
say
Lord

<EOS>
"
yes
;
you
have
better
come

<EOS>
all
this
be
wear
me

perhaps
more
than
you
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
come
soon
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
and
then
he
return
among
Lady
Glencora
's
guest
,
very
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
get
home
in
safety
and
lock
up
her
diamond
in
the
iron
box
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
have
nothing
to
give
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
end
of
June
,
and
Frank
Greystock
have
be
as
yet
but
once
at
Fawn
Court
since
he
have
write
to
Lucy
Morris
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
that
be
three
week
since
,
and
as
the
barrier
against
him
at
Fawn
Court
have
be
remove
by
Lady
Fawn
herself
,
the
Fawn
girl
think
that
as
a
lover
he
be
very
slack
;
but
Lucy
be
not
in
the
least
annoyed
.
<EOS>
Lucy
know
that
it
be
all
right
;
for
Frank
,
as
he
take
his
last
walk
round
the
shrubbery
with
her
during
that
visit
,
have
give
her
to
understand
that
there
be
a
little
difference
between
him
and
Lady
Fawn
in
regard
to
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
her
only
relative
in
London
,
"
Frank
have
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Linlithgow
,
"
suggest
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
quarrel
,
and
the
old
woman
be
as
bitter
as
gall
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
else
to
stand
up
for
her
,
and
I
must
see
that
she
be
not
ill
-
use
.
<EOS>
woman
do
hate
each
other
so
virulently
,
and
Lady
Fawn
hate
her
future
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
Lucy
do
not
in
the
least
grudge
her
lover
's
assistance
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
of
jealousy
in
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
Lizzie
be
unworthy
of
Frank
's
goodness
,
but
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
she
would
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
She
tell
him
nothing
of
the
bribe
that
have
be
offer
her
,
nor
on
that
subject
have
she
say
a
word
to
any
of
the
Fawns
.
<EOS>
She
understand
,
too
,
that
as
Frank
have
declare
his
purpose
of
support
Lizzie
,
it
may
be
as
well
that
he
should
see
just
at
present
as
little
of
Lady
Fawn
as
possible
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
,
however
,
have
Lady
Fawn
say
to
Lucy
disparage
her
lover
for
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
understand
now
at
Fawn
Court
,
by
all
the
girl
,
and
no
doubt
by
the
whole
establishment
,
that
Lizzie
Eustace
be
to
be
regard
as
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
It
be
believe
by
them
all
that
Lord
Fawn
have
break
off
the
match
 
<EOS>
or
,
at
least
,
that
he
be
resolve
to
break
it
;
but
various
stratagem
be
to
be
use
,
and
terrible
engine
of
war
be
to
be
bring
up
,
if
necessary
,
to
prevent
an
alliance
which
be
now
think
to
be
disreputable
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
be
hard
at
work
,
and
have
find
out
something
very
like
truth
in
regard
to
the
whole
transaction
with
Mr.
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
find
out
more
than
be
quite
true
as
to
poor
Lizzie
's
former
sin
;
but
what
she
do
find
out
she
use
with
all
her
skill
,
communicate
her
fact
to
her
mother
,
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
have
almost
quarrel
with
her
,
but
still
she
continue
to
communicate
her
fact
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
period
Frank
Greystock
be
certainly
somewhat
unreasonable
in
regard
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
,
as
the
reader
will
remember
,
he
have
think
of
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
;
 
because
she
be
rich
;
but
even
then
he
have
not
think
well
of
her
,
have
hardly
believe
her
to
be
honest
,
and
have
rejoice
when
he
find
that
circumstance
rather
than
his
own
judgment
have
rescue
him
from
that
evil
.
<EOS>
He
have
profess
to
be
delighted
when
Lord
Fawn
be
accept
,
 
as
be
happy
to
think
that
his
somewhat
dangerous
cousin
be
provide
with
so
safe
a
husband
;
and
,
when
he
have
first
hear
of
the
necklace
,
he
have
express
an
opinion
that
of
course
it
would
be
give
up
.
<EOS>
in
all
this
then
he
have
show
no
strong
loyalty
to
his
cousin
,
no
very
dear
friendship
,
nothing
to
make
those
who
know
him
feel
that
he
would
buckle
on
armour
in
her
cause
.
<EOS>
but
of
late
,
 
and
that
,
too
,
since
his
engagement
with
Lucy
,
 
he
have
stand
up
very
stoutly
as
her
friend
,
and
the
armour
be
be
buckle
on
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
scruple
to
say
that
he
mean
to
see
her
through
this
business
with
Lord
Fawn
,
and
have
somewhat
astonish
Mr.
Camperdown
by
raise
a
doubt
on
the
question
of
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
can
not
but
know
that
she
have
no
more
right
to
it
than
I
have
,
"
Mr.
Camperdown
have
say
to
his
son
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
be
become
unhappy
about
the
necklace
,
not
quite
know
how
to
proceed
in
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Frank
have
obey
his
well
instinct
,
and
have
ask
Lucy
Morris
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
to
Fawn
Court
in
compliance
with
a
promise
to
Lizzie
Eustace
,
that
he
would
call
upon
her
there
.
<EOS>
He
have
walk
with
Lucy
because
he
be
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
write
to
Lucy
because
of
the
word
he
have
speak
during
the
walk
.
<EOS>
in
all
this
the
matter
have
arrange
itself
as
such
matter
do
,
and
there
be
nothing
,
in
truth
,
to
be
regret
.
<EOS>
He
really
do
love
the
girl
with
all
his
heart
.
<EOS>
It
may
,
perhaps
,
be
say
that
he
have
never
in
truth
love
any
other
woman
.
<EOS>
in
the
good
humour
of
his
mind
he
would
tell
himself
,
 
have
from
old
time
tell
himself
often
,
 
that
unless
he
marry
Lucy
Morris
he
could
never
marry
at
all
.
<EOS>
when
his
mother
,
know
that
poor
Lucy
be
penniless
,
have
,
as
mother
will
do
,
beg
him
to
beware
,
he
have
speak
up
for
his
love
honestly
,
declare
to
her
that
in
his
eye
there
be
no
woman
live
equal
to
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
the
reader
have
see
him
with
the
word
almost
on
his
tongue
with
which
to
offer
his
hand
to
his
cousin
,
Lizzie
Eustace
,
know
as
he
do
so
that
his
heart
have
be
give
to
Lucy
,
 
know
also
that
Lucy
's
heart
have
be
give
to
him
!
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
do
it
,
and
the
well
humour
have
prevail
.
  
<EOS>
within
the
figure
and
frame
and
clothe
and
cuticle
,
within
the
bone
and
flesh
of
many
of
us
,
there
be
but
one
person
,
 
a
man
or
woman
,
with
a
preponderance
either
of
good
or
evil
,
whose
conduct
in
any
emergency
may
be
predict
with
some
assurance
of
accuracy
by
any
one
know
the
man
or
woman
.
<EOS>
such
person
be
simple
,
single
,
and
,
perhaps
,
generally
,
safe
.
<EOS>
They
walk
along
line
in
accordance
with
certain
fix
instinct
or
principle
,
and
be
to
-
day
as
they
be
yesterday
,
and
will
be
to
-
morrow
as
they
be
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
be
such
a
person
,
and
so
be
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
opposite
in
their
character
as
the
two
pole
,
they
be
,
each
of
them
,
a
simple
entity
;
and
any
doubt
or
error
in
judging
of
the
future
conduct
of
either
of
them
would
come
from
insufficient
knowledge
of
the
woman
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
human
being
who
,
though
of
necessity
single
in
body
,
be
dual
in
character
;
 
in
whose
breast
not
only
be
evil
always
fight
against
good
,
 
but
to
whom
evil
be
sometimes
horribly
,
hideously
evil
,
but
be
sometimes
also
not
hideous
at
all
.
<EOS>
of
such
man
it
may
be
say
that
Satan
obtain
an
intermittent
grasp
,
from
which
,
when
it
be
release
,
the
rebound
carry
them
high
amidst
virtuous
resolution
and
a
thorough
love
of
thing
good
and
noble
.
<EOS>
such
man
,
 
or
woman
,
 
may
hardly
,
perhaps
,
debase
themselves
with
the
more
vulgar
vice
.
<EOS>
They
will
not
be
rogue
,
or
thief
,
or
drunkard
,
 
or
,
perhaps
,
liar
;
but
ambition
,
luxury
,
self
-
indulgence
,
pride
,
and
covetousness
will
get
a
hold
of
them
,
and
in
various
mood
will
be
to
them
virtue
in
lieu
of
vice
.
<EOS>
such
a
man
be
Frank
Greystock
,
who
could
walk
along
the
bank
of
the
quiet
,
trout
-
give
Bob
,
at
Bobsborough
,
whip
the
river
with
his
rod
,
tell
himself
that
the
world
lose
for
love
would
be
a
bad
thing
well
lose
for
a
fine
purpose
;
and
who
could
also
stand
,
with
his
hand
in
his
trouser
pocket
,
look
down
upon
the
pavement
,
in
the
purlieu
of
the
court
at
Westminster
,
and
swear
to
himself
that
he
would
win
the
game
,
let
the
cost
to
his
heart
be
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
what
must
a
man
be
who
would
allow
some
undefined
feeling
,
 
some
inward
ache
which
he
call
a
passion
and
can
not
analyse
,
some
desire
which
have
come
of
instinct
and
not
of
judgment
,
 
to
interfere
with
all
the
project
of
his
intellect
,
with
all
the
work
which
he
have
lay
out
for
his
accomplishment
?
<EOS>
circumstance
have
throw
him
into
a
path
of
life
for
which
,
indeed
,
his
mean
be
insufficient
,
but
which
he
regard
as
,
of
all
path
,
the
noblest
and
the
manly
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
be
true
to
himself
,
 
with
such
truth
as
at
these
moment
would
seem
to
him
to
be
the
true
truth
,
 
there
be
nothing
in
rank
,
nothing
in
ambition
,
which
may
not
be
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
He
may
live
with
the
high
,
the
best
-
educate
,
and
the
most
beautiful
;
he
may
assist
in
direct
national
council
by
his
intelligence
;
and
may
make
a
name
for
himself
which
should
be
remember
in
his
country
,
and
of
which
man
would
read
the
record
in
the
history
write
in
after
age
.
<EOS>
but
to
do
this
,
he
must
walk
warily
.
<EOS>
He
,
an
embarrassed
man
,
a
man
already
in
debt
,
a
man
with
no
realise
property
come
to
him
in
reversion
,
be
call
upon
to
live
,
and
to
live
as
though
at
his
ease
,
among
those
who
have
be
bear
to
wealth
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
he
have
so
cleverly
learn
the
way
of
the
wealthy
,
that
he
hardly
know
any
longer
how
to
live
at
his
ease
among
the
poor
.
  
<EOS>
but
have
he
walk
warily
when
he
go
down
to
Richmond
,
and
afterwards
,
sit
alone
in
the
obscurity
of
his
chamber
,
write
the
letter
which
have
make
Lucy
Morris
so
happy
?
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledge
that
he
do
,
in
truth
,
love
the
girl
,
 
that
he
be
capable
of
a
strong
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
beautiful
,
 
hardly
even
pretty
,
small
,
in
appearance
almost
insignificant
,
quite
penniless
,
a
governess
!
<EOS>
He
have
often
ask
himself
what
it
be
that
have
so
vanquish
him
.
<EOS>
She
always
wear
a
pale
grey
frock
,
 
with
,
perhaps
,
a
grey
ribbon
,
 
never
run
into
any
bright
form
of
clothing
.
<EOS>
She
be
educate
,
very
well
-
educate
;
but
she
own
no
great
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
sing
his
heart
away
,
or
ravish
him
with
the
harp
.
<EOS>
even
of
her
word
she
be
spare
,
seem
to
care
more
to
listen
than
to
speak
;
a
humble
little
thing
to
look
at
,
 
one
of
whom
you
may
say
that
she
regard
herself
as
well
-
place
if
leave
in
the
background
.
<EOS>
yet
he
have
find
her
out
,
and
know
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
recognise
the
treasure
,
and
have
greatly
desire
to
possess
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
confess
to
himself
that
,
could
splendour
and
ambition
be
lay
aside
,
that
little
thing
would
be
all
the
world
to
him
.
<EOS>
as
he
sit
in
court
,
or
in
the
House
,
patient
from
practice
as
he
half
-
listen
to
the
ponderous
speech
of
advocate
or
politician
,
he
would
think
of
the
sparkle
in
her
eye
,
of
the
dimple
in
her
chin
,
of
the
line
of
the
mouth
which
could
plead
so
eloquently
,
though
with
few
word
.
<EOS>
to
sit
on
some
high
seat
among
his
countryman
,
and
also
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
,
 
that
would
be
a
high
ambition
.
<EOS>
He
have
choose
his
way
now
,
and
she
be
engage
to
be
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
think
of
it
after
he
have
do
it
,
it
be
not
all
happiness
,
all
contentment
,
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
feel
that
he
have
cripple
himself
,
 
impede
himself
in
run
the
race
,
as
it
be
,
with
a
log
round
his
leg
.
<EOS>
He
have
offer
to
marry
her
,
and
he
must
do
so
at
once
,
or
almost
at
once
,
because
she
could
now
find
no
other
home
<EOS>
but
his
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
as
well
as
do
Lady
Fawn
,
that
she
could
not
go
into
another
family
as
governess
;
and
he
know
also
that
she
ought
not
to
remain
in
Lady
Fawn
's
house
an
hour
longer
than
she
would
be
want
there
.
<EOS>
He
must
alter
his
plan
of
live
at
once
,
give
up
the
luxury
of
his
room
at
the
Grosvenor
,
take
a
small
house
somewhere
,
probably
near
the
Swiss
Cottage
,
come
up
and
down
to
his
chamber
by
the
underground
railway
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
abandon
Parliament
altogether
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
sure
whether
,
in
good
faith
,
he
should
not
at
once
give
notice
of
his
intend
acceptance
of
the
Chiltern
Hundreds
to
the
elector
of
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
thus
meditate
,
under
the
influence
of
that
intermittent
evil
grasp
,
almost
angry
with
himself
for
the
open
truth
which
he
have
speak
,
 
or
rather
write
,
and
perhaps
think
more
of
Lizzie
and
her
beauty
than
he
should
have
do
,
in
the
course
of
three
week
he
have
pay
but
one
visit
to
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
then
,
of
a
sudden
,
find
himself
one
afternoon
relieve
from
work
,
he
resolve
to
go
there
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
still
almost
at
their
long
,
and
he
do
not
scruple
to
present
himself
before
Lady
Fawn
between
eight
and
nine
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
at
tea
,
and
he
be
welcome
kindly
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
when
he
be
announce
,
at
once
get
up
and
meet
him
almost
at
the
doorway
,
sparkle
with
just
a
tear
of
joy
in
her
eye
,
with
a
look
in
her
face
,
and
a
love
manner
,
which
for
the
moment
make
him
sure
that
the
little
house
near
the
Swiss
Cottage
would
,
after
all
,
be
the
only
Elysium
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
if
she
speak
a
word
he
hardly
hear
it
,
but
her
hand
be
in
his
,
so
cool
and
soft
,
almost
tremble
in
its
grasp
,
with
no
attempt
to
withdraw
itself
,
frank
,
loving
,
and
honest
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
perfect
satisfaction
in
her
greeting
which
at
once
tell
him
that
she
have
no
discontent
thought
,
 
have
have
no
such
thought
,
 
because
he
have
be
so
long
without
come
.
<EOS>
to
see
him
be
a
great
joy
.
<EOS>
but
every
hour
of
her
life
be
a
joy
to
her
,
know
,
as
she
do
know
,
that
he
love
her
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
be
gracious
,
the
girl
be
hospitable
,
and
he
find
himself
make
very
welcome
amidst
all
the
woman
at
the
tea
-
table
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
be
say
about
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
talk
about
Parliament
,
and
profess
to
pity
a
poor
lover
who
be
so
bind
to
his
country
that
he
could
not
see
his
mistress
above
once
a
fortnight
.
"
<EOS>
but
there
will
be
a
good
time
come
next
month
,
"
she
say
;
 
for
it
be
now
July
.
"
<EOS>
though
the
girl
can
not

their
claim

the
grouse
can

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be

the
House
altogether
that
rule
me
with
a
rod
of
iron

Fawn

"
say
Frank
,
"
but
the
necessity
of
earn
daily
bread
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow

<EOS>
a
man
who
have
to
sit
in
court
all
day
must
take
the
night

,
indeed
,
any
time
that
he
can
get

to

up
his
case

the
grouse

"
My
gardener
tell
me
just
now
that
he
want
a
day
or
two

August

I
do
not

that
he

Mr.

it

to
the

<EOS>
the
Ayrshire
grouse
-
shooting
be
not
the
good
in
Scotland
;
 
but
there
be
grouse
-
shooting
in
Ayrshire
;
and
the
shooting
on
the
Portray
mountain
be
not
the
bad
shooting
in
the
county

<EOS>
the
castle
at
Portray
overhang
the
sea

there
be
a
wild
district

it
stretch
far
back
inland

in
regard
to
which
Lizzie
Eustace
be
very
proud
of
talk
of

her
shooting

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
early
in
the
spring
of
the
present
year
she
have
ask
her
cousin
Frank
to
accept
the
shooting
for
the
come
season
,
 
and
he
have
accept
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
probably
be
abroad
,
"
she
say
,
"
but
there
be
the
old
castle
.
"
<EOS>
She
have
offer
it
as
though
he
have
be
her
brother
,
and
he
have
say
that
he
would
go
down
for
a
couple
of
week
,
 
not
to
the
castle
,
but
to
a
little
lodge
some
mile
up
from
the
sea
,
of
which
she
tell
him
when
he
decline
the
castle
.
<EOS>
when
this
invitation
be
give
there
be
no
engagement
between
her
and
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
since
that
date
,
within
the
last
day
or
two
,
she
have
remind
him
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
will
not
his
lordship
be
there
?
"
<EOS>
he
have
say
laughingly
.
"
<EOS>
certainly
not
,
"
she
have
answer
with
serious
earnestness
.
<EOS>
then
she
have
explain
that
her
plan
of
go
abroad
have
be
set
aside
by
circumstance
.
<EOS>
She
do
mean
to
go
down
to
Portray
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
have
you
at
the
castle
,
"
she
say
,
smile
;
"
but
even
an
Othello
could
not
object
to
a
first
cousin
at
a
little
cottage
ever
so
many
mile
off
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
for
him
to
suggest
what
objection
may
rise
to
the
brain
of
a
modern
Othello
;
but
after
some
hesitation
he
say
that
he
would
be
there
.
<EOS>
He
have
promise
the
trip
to
a
friend
,
and
would
like
to
keep
his
promise
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
almost
think
that
he
ought
to
avoid
Portray
.
<EOS>
He
intend
to
support
his
cousin
as
far
as
he
may
do
so
honestly
;
but
he
be
not
quite
minded
to
stand
by
her
through
good
report
and
evil
report
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
desire
to
be
specially
know
as
her
champion
,
and
yet
he
feel
that
that
position
would
be
almost
force
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
foresaw
danger
,
 
and
consequently
he
be
doubt
about
his
journey
to
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
whether
I
be

not

"
say
Frank
,
 
<EOS>
and
he
almost
feel
that
he
be
blush

<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
be
,
"
say
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
when
a
man
have
to
work
all
day

nearly
all
night
he
should
go
where
he
may
get
fresh
air

"
  
<EOS>

there
be
very
good
air

Lady
Fawn

keep
up
an
excellent
house
at
Richmond
,

who
,
with
all
her
daughter
,
could
not
afford
autumn
trip
.
<EOS>
the
Fawns
live
at
Fawn
Court
all
the
year
round
,
and
consequently
Lady
Fawn
think
that
air
be
to
be
find
in
England
sufficiently
good
for
all
purpose
of
vitality
and
recreation
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
quite
the
same
thing
,
"
say
Lucy
;
 
"
at
least
,
not
for
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
she
be
allow
to
escape
into
the
ground
with
her
lover
,
and
be
make
happy
with
half
-
an
-
hour
of
unalloyed
bliss
.
<EOS>
to
be
alone
with
the
girl
to
whom
he
be
not
engage
be
a
man
's
delight
;
 
to
be
alone
with
the
man
to
whom
she
be
engage
<EOS>
be
the
woman
's
.
<EOS>
when
the
thing
be
settle
there
be
always
present
to
the
man
something
of
a
feeling
of
clip
wing
;
whereas
the
woman
be
conscious
of
a
new
power
of
expand
her
pinion
.
<EOS>
the
certainty
of
the
thing
be
to
him
repressive
.
<EOS>
He
have
do
his
work
,
and
gain
his
victory
,
 
and
by
conquering
have
become
a
slave
.
<EOS>
to
her
the
certainty
of
the
thing
be
the
removal
of
a
restraint
which
have
hitherto
always
be
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
can
tell
him
everything
,
and
be
tell
everything
,
 
whereas
her
previous
confidence
,
make
with
those
of
her
own
sex
,
have
be
tame
,
and
by
comparison
valueless
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
new
confidence
to
make
,
 
unless
when
he
come
to
tell
her
he
like
his
meat
well
do
,
and
want
his
breakfast
to
be
punctual

<EOS>
Lucy
now
not
only
promise
herself

do
actually
realise
a
great
joy

<EOS>
He
seem
to
her
all
that
her
heart
desire

<EOS>
He
be
a
man
whose
manner
be
naturally
caress
and
demonstrative

she
be
to
him

of
all
woman

the
sweetest

the
dear

the
most
perfect

all
his

,
Frank

what

ask
his

with
a

sharp

then
turn
upon
her
for
an
answer

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

she
say
,
very
softly

still
cling
to
him

I
sometimes

there
be
a
difference

still

we
hardly

as
she
accept
him
,
you
may
be
sure
that

have
more
to
give

so

I
would
go
back
even
now

he
answer

It
be
because
you
have
so
much
to
give

so
much
more

body

soul

Lucy

I

Fawn

fighting

can
make

understand
what

him

He
be
make
a
paltry
excuse

why
should
he
want
to
excuse
himself

afraid

have
get
hold

lie

think
there
will
be

will
marry

it

disagreeable

She
hardly

of
the
brooch
to
herself
,
nor
of
the
story
which
by
degree
be
reach
her
ear
as
to
the
old
debt
,
and
the
diamond
,
and
the
young
bride
's
conduct
to
Lady
Linlithgow
as
soon
as
she
marry
her
grand
husband
,
Sir
Florian
.
<EOS>
She
do
think
badly
of
Lizzie
,
and
could
not
but
regret
that
her
own
noble
,
generous
Frank
should
have
to
expend
his
time
and
labour
on
a
friend
unworthy
of
his
friendship
;
but
there
be
no
shade
of
jealousy
in
her
feeling
,
and
she
utter
no
word
against
Lizzie
more
bitter
than
that
in
which
she
declare
that
there
be
a
difference
between
people
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
something
say
as
to
their
own
prospect
in
life
.
<EOS>
Lucy
at
once
and
with
vehemence
declare
that
she
do
not
look
for
or
expect
an
immediate
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
scruple
to
tell
him
that
she
know
well
how
difficult
be
the
task
before
him
,
and
that
it
may
be
essential
for
his
interest
that
he
should
remain
as
he
be
for
a
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
He
be
astonish
to
find
how
completely
she
understand
his
position
,
and
how
thoroughly
she
sympathise
with
his
interest
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
only
one
thing
I
could
not
do
for
you
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
the
one
thing
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
give
you
up
.
<EOS>
I
almost
think
that
I
ought
to
refuse
you
because
I
can
do
nothing
,
 
nothing
to
help
you
.
<EOS>
but
there
will
always
come
a
limit
to
self
-
denial
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
that
!
<EOS>
Could
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
know
how
this
question
be
answer
,
and
will
not
want
to
be
tell
of
the
long
,
close
,
cling
,
praiseworthy
kiss
with
which
the
young
barrister
assure
her
that
would
have
be
on
her
part
an
act
of
self
-
denial
which
would
to
him
have
be
absolutely
ruinous
.
<EOS>
It
be
agree
,
however
,
between
them
,
that
Lady
Fawn
should
be
tell
that
they
do
not
propose
to
marry
till
some
time
in
the
following
year
,
and
that
she
should
be
formally
ask
to
allow
Lucy
to
have
a
home
at
Fawn
Court
in
the
interval
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
My
Brother
"
 
Lord
Fawn
have
promise
,
as
he
put
Lizzie
into
her
carriage
,
that
he
would
come
to
her
soon
,
 
but
he
do
not
come
soon
.
<EOS>
a
fortnight
pass
and
he
do
not
show
himself
.
<EOS>
nothing
further
have
be
do
in
the
matter
of
the
diamond
,
except
that
Mr.
Camperdown
have
write
to
Frank
Greystock
,
explain
how
impossible
it
be
that
the
question
of
their
possession
should
be
refer
to
arbitration
.
<EOS>
accord
to
him
they
belong
to
the
heir
,
as
do
the
estate
;
and
no
one
would
have
the
power
of
accept
an
arbitration
respect
them
,
 
an
arbitration
which
may
separate
them
from
the
estate
of
which
an
infant
be
the
owner
for
his
life
,
 
any
more
than
such
arbitration
could
be
accept
as
to
the
property
of
the
estate
itself
.
<EOS>
"
possession
be
nine
point
of
the
law
,
"
say
Frank
to
himself
,
as
he
put
the
letter
aside
,
 
think
at
the
same
time
that
possession
in
the
hand
of
Lizzie
Eustace
include
certainly
every
one
of
those
nine
point
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
wear
her
diamond
again
and
then
again
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
a
question
whether
the
possession
of
the
necklace
and
the
publicity
of
their
history
,
 
which
,
however
,
like
many
other
history
,
be
most
inaccurately
tell
,
 
do
not
add
something
to
her
reputation
as
a
lady
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
Lord
Fawn
do
not
come
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
so
she
write
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Frederic
,
have
you
not
better
come
to
me
?
<EOS>
yours
affectionately

L.
I
go
to
the
North
at
the
end
of
this
month

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Frank
Greystock
do
visit
her
,
 
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
on
the
day
after
the
above
letter
be
write
he
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
Sunday
afternoon
,
when
July
be
more
than
half
over
,
and
he
find
her
alone
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
have
go
to
church
,
and
Lizzie
be
lie
listlessly
on
a
sofa
with
a
volume
of
poetry
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
have
in
truth
be
read
the
book
,
and
in
her
way
enjoy
it
.
<EOS>
It
tell
her
the
story
of
certain
knight
of
old
,
who
have
go
forth
in
quest
of
a
sign
from
heaven
,
which
sign
,
if
verily
see
by
them
,
may
be
take
to
signify
that
they
themselves
be
esteem
holy
,
and
fit
for
heavenly
joy
.
<EOS>
one
would
have
think
that
no
theme
could
have
be
less
palatable
to
such
a
one
as
Lizzie
Eustace
;
but
the
melody
of
the
line
have
please
her
ear
,
and
she
be
always
able
to
arouse
for
herself
a
false
enthusiasm
on
thing
which
be
utterly
outside
herself
in
life
.
<EOS>
She
think
she
too
could
have
travel
in
search
of
that
holy
sign
,
and
have
bear
all
thing
,
and
abandon
all
thing
,
and
have
persevere
,
 
and
of
a
certainty
have
be
reward
.
<EOS>
but
as
for
give
up
a
string
of
diamond
,
in
common
honesty
,
 
that
be
beyond
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
man
ever
be
like
that
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
as
she
allow
her
cousin
to
take
the
book
from
her
hand
.

let
us
hope
not

<EOS>
"
oh

Frank

"
  
<EOS>

They
be

no

you

you
will
read
to
the
end

"
I
have
read
it
all
,
 
every
word
of
it
,

say
Lizzie
,
enthusiastically
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
know
that
Arthur
do
not
go
on
the
search
,
because
he
have
a
job
of
work
to
do
,
by
the
doing
of
which
the
people
around
him

perhaps
be

"
I
like

do

.
<EOS>
how
unlike
she
be
to
Lucy
!
<EOS>
He
believe
her
,
 
in
part
;
and
yet
that
be
the
idea
that
occur
to
him
.
<EOS>
when
Lucy
be
much
in
earnest
,
in
her
eye
,
too
,
a
tear
would
sparkle
,
the
small
drop
,
a
bright
liquid
diamond
that
never
fall
;
and
all
her
face
would
be
bright
and
eloquent
with
feeling
;
 
but
how
unlike
be
the
two
!
<EOS>
He
know
that
the
difference
be
that
between
truth
and
falsehood
;
 
and
yet
he
partly
believe
the
falsehood
!
<EOS>
"
if
I
know
how
to
save
you
from
an
hour
's
uneasiness
,
I
would
do
it
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
no
;
 
no
;
"
she
murmur
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
I
not
?
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
me
then
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
nothing
further
to
say
,
and
it
suit
her
to
remain
silent
for
the
moment
,
while
she
dry
her
eye
,
and
recover
her
composure
,
and
prepare
herself
to
carry
on
the
battle
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
She
would
carry
on
the
battle
,
use
every
wile
she
know
,
strain
every
nerve
to
be
victorious
,
encounter
any
and
all
danger
,
and
yet
she
have
no
definite
aim
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
herself
do
not
know
what
she
would
be
at
.
<EOS>
at
this
period
of
her
career
she
do
not
want
to
marry
her
cousin
,
 
have
resolve
that
she
would
be
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
nor
do
she
intend
that
her
cousin
should
be
her
lover
,
 
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
love
.
<EOS>
She
be
far
too
wary
in
the
pursuit
of
the
world
's
good
to
sacrifice
herself
to
any
such
wish
as
that
.
<EOS>
She
do
want
him
to
help
her
about
the
diamond
,
 
but
such
help
as
that
she
may
have
,
as
she
know
well
,
on
much
easy
term
.
<EOS>
there
be
probably
an
anxiety
in
her
bosom
to
cause
him
to
be
untrue
to
Lucy
Morris
;
but
the
guide
motive
of
her
conduct
be
the
desire
to
make
thing
seem
to
be
other
than
they
be
.
<EOS>
to
be
always
act
a
part
rather
than
live
her
own
life
be
to
her
everything
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
all
we
must
come
to
fact
,
"
he
say
,
after
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
will
be
well
that
you
should
marry
Lord
Fawn
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
;
 
I
can
not
have
that
say
.
<EOS>
in
this
matter
you
must
rule
yourself
by
your
own
judgment
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
averse
to
it
 
<EOS>
"
She
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
then
you
will
own
that
it
have
better
be
so
.
"
<EOS>
again
she
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
for
your
sake
and
my
own
,
I
must
declare
,
that
if
you
have
no
opinion
in
this
matter
,
neither
will
I
have
any
.
<EOS>
You
shall
never
have
to
say
that
I
press
you
into
this
marriage
or
debar
you
from
marry
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
such
an
accusation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
may
tell
me
what
I
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
certainly
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
think
how
young
I
be
,
and
,
 
by
comparison
,
 
how
old
you
be
.
<EOS>
You
be
eight
year
old
than
I
be
.
<EOS>
remember
;
 
after
all
that
I
have
go
through
,
I
be
but
twenty
-
two
.
<EOS>
at
my
age
other
girl
have
their
friend
to
tell
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
one
,
 
unless
you
will
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
accept
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
be
not
altogether
indifferent
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
,
and
again
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
if
you
mean
,
do
I
love
him
,
as
I
could
love
some
man
whose
heart
be
quite
congenial
to
my
own
,
certainly
I
do
not
.
"
<EOS>
She
continue
to
shake
her
head
very
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
I
esteem
him
,
 
when
he
ask
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
say
at
once
that
,
have
make
up
your
mind
,
you
will
go
through
with
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
that
I
ought
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
,
 
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
be
it
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
I
will
.
<EOS>
but
,
Frank
,
I
will
not
give
up
my
property
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
wish
me
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
weak
,
now
;
 
would
it
not
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
that
it
be
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
faith
to
you
should
not
depend
on
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
of
course
not
;
that
be
just
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
He
can
have
no
right
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
when
he
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
,
he
say
nothing
about
that
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
do
not
come
to
me
,
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
have
better
see
him
,
"
say
Frank
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
?
<EOS>
that
will
be
so
good
of
you

<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
can
leave
it
all
so
safely
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
out
of
town
,
you
know
,
on
the
thirtieth
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
shall
be
better
away
,
and
I
be
sick
of
all
the
noise
,
and
glitter
,
and
worldliness
of
London
.
<EOS>
You
will
come
on
the
twelfth
?
"
  
"
not
quite
so
soon
as
that
,
"
he
say
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
about
the
twentieth
.
"
  
"
and
,
of
course
,
I
shall
see
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
.
"
  
"
so
that
I
may
have
some
one
to
guide
me
that
I
can
trust
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
brother
,
Frank
;
do
you
ever
think
of
that
?
"
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
to
him
,
and
he
clasp
it
,
and
hold
it
tight
in
his
own
;
and
then
,
after
a
while
,
he
pull
her
towards
him
.
<EOS>
in
a
moment
she
be
on
the
ground
,
kneel
at
his
foot
,
and
his
arm
be
round
her
shoulder
,
and
his
hand
be
on
her
back
,
and
he
be
embrace
her
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
turn
up
to
him
,
and
he
press
his
lip
upon
her
forehead
.
"
<EOS>
as
my
brother
,
"
she
say
,
stretch
back
her
head
and
look
up
into
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
as
your
brother
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
sit
,
or
rather
act
their
little
play
together
,
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
and
the
ordinary
entrance
to
the
two
room
be
from
the
landing
-
place
into
the
large
apartment
;
 
of
which
fact
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
probably
aware
,
when
she
permit
herself
to
fall
into
a
position
as
to
which
a
moment
or
two
may
be
want
for
recovery
.
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
the
servant
in
livery
open
the
door
,
which
he
do
,
as
Frank
think
somewhat
suddenly
,
she
be
able
to
be
stand
on
her
leg
before
she
be
catch
.
<EOS>
the
quickness
with
which
she
spring
from
her
position
,
and
the
facility
with
which
she
compose
not
her
face
only
,
but
the
loose
lock
of
her
hair
and
all
her
person
,
for
the
reception
of
the
coming
visitor
,
be
quite
marvellous
.
<EOS>
about
her
there
be
none
of
the
look
of
have
be
find
out
,
which
be
so
very
disagreeable
to
the
wearer
of
it
;
whereas
Frank
,
when
Lord
Fawn
be
announce
,
be
aware
that
his
manner
be
awkward
,
and
his
general
appearance
flurry
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
no
more
flurried
than
if
she
have
step
that
moment
from
out
of
the
hand
of
her
tirewoman
.
<EOS>
She
greet
Lord
Fawn
very
prettily
,
hold
him
by
the
hand
long
enough
to
show
that
she
have
more
claim
to
do
so
than
could
any
other
woman
,
and
then
she
just
murmur
her
cousin
's
name
.
<EOS>
the
two
man
shake
hand
 
and
look
at
each
other
as
man
do
who
know
that
they
be
not
friend
,
and
think
that
they
may
live
to
be
enemy
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
who
rarely
forget
anything
,
have
certainly
not
forget
the
Sawab
;
and
Frank
be
aware
that
he
may
soon
be
call
on
to
address
his
lordship
in
anything
but
friendly
term
.
<EOS>
They
say
,
however
,
a
few
word
about
Parliament
and
the
weather
,
and
the
desirability
of
escape
from
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
,
"
say
Lady
Eustace
,
"
be
come
down
in
August
to
shoot
my
three
annual
grouse
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
He
would
keep
one
for
you
,
my
lord
,
if
he
think
you
would
come
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
promise
Lord
Fawn
a
fair
third
,
at
any
rate
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
visit
Portray
this
August
,
I
be
afraid
,
"
say
his
lordship
,
"
much
as
I
may
wish
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
one
of
us
must
remain
at
the
India
Office
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
,
that
weary
India
Office
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
almost
think
you
official
man
be
bad
off
than
we
barrister
,
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
Lizzie
,
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
shall
see
you
again
before
you
start
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
will
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
two
lover
be
leave
together
.
<EOS>
They
have
meet
once
,
at
Lady
Glencora
's
ball
,
since
the
quarrel
at
Fawn
Court
,
and
there
,
as
though
by
mutual
forbearance
,
have
not
allude
to
their
trouble
.
<EOS>
now
he
have
come
,
especially
to
speak
of
the
matter
that
concern
them
both
so
deeply
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
Frank
Greystock
be
in
the
room
,
his
work
be
comparatively
easy
,
but
he
have
know
beforehand
that
he
would
not
find
it
at
all
easy
should
he
be
leave
alone
with
her
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
begin
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
she
say
,
"
consider
all
that
have
pass
between
us
,
you
have
be
a
truant
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
admit
it
 
<EOS>
but
 
"
  
"
with
me
,
my
lord
,
a
fault
admit
be
a
fault
forgive
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
she
take
her
old
seat
on
the
sofa
,
and
he
place
himself
on
the
chair
which
Frank
Greystock
have
occupy
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
intend
to
own
a
fault
,
and
certainly
not
to
accept
forgiveness
;
but
she
have
be
too
quick
for
him
;
and
now
he
could
not
find
word
by
which
to
express
himself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
truth
,
"
she
continue
,
"
I
would
always
rather
remember
one
kindness
than
a
dozen
omission
on
the
part
of
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Eustace
,
I
have
not
willingly
omit
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
be
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
give
you
the
slight
excuse
for
say
that
you
have
hear
a
reproach
from
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
come
at
last
,
and
you
be
welcome
.
<EOS>
be
that
enough
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
much
to
say
to
her
about
the
diamond
,
and
,
when
he
be
enter
the
room
,
he
have
not
a
word
to
say
to
her
about
anything
else
.
<EOS>
since
that
,
another
subject
have
spring
up
before
him
.
<EOS>
whether
he
be
,
or
be
not
,
to
regard
himself
as
be
at
this
moment
engage
to
marry
Lady
Eustace
,
be
a
matter
to
him
of
much
doubt
;
 
but
of
this
he
be
sure
,
that
if
she
be
engage
to
him
as
his
wife
<EOS>
,
she
ought
not
to
be
entertain
her
cousin
Frank
Greystock
down
at
Portray
Castle
,
unless
she
have
some
old
lady
,
not
only
respectable
in
life
,
but
high
in
rank
also
,
to
see
that
everything
be
right
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
an
insult
to
him
that
such
a
visit
should
have
be
arrange
without
his
sanction
or
cognizance
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
if
he
be
bind
by
no
engagement
,
 
and
he
have
be
persuade
by
his
mother
and
sister
to
wish
that
he
be
not
bind
,
 
then
the
matter
would
be
no
affair
of
his
.
<EOS>
if
,
however
,
the
diamond
be
abandon
,
then
the
engagement
be
to
be
continue
;
 
and
in
that
case
it
be
out
of
the
question
that
his
elect
bride
should
entertain
another
young
man
,
 
even
though
she
be
a
widow
and
the
young
man
be
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
he
should
have
speak
of
the
diamond
first
;
but
the
other
matter
have
obtrude
itself
upon
him
,
and
he
be
puzzle
.
<EOS>
"
be
Mr.
Greystock
to
accompany
you
into
Scotland
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
the
thirtieth
of
this
month
.

I
hardly
know
when
he

to
be
there

"
He

you
to
Portray

<EOS>
"
yes

course

<EOS>
the
king
himself

follow
her
,
when
she
have
go
before

<EOS>
"
Lord
Fawn
do
not
remember
the
quotation

and
be
more
puzzled
than
ever

<EOS>
Frank
will
follow
me
,
just
as
the

follow
me

<EOS>
"
He
go
direct
to
Portray
Castle

"
  
<EOS>
"
neither
directly
nor
indirectly

<EOS>
just
at
present
,
Lord
Fawn
,
I
be
in
no
mood
to
entertain
guest
,
 
not
even
one
that
I
love
so
well
as
my
cousin
Frank

<EOS>
the
Portray
mountain
be
somewhat
extensive
,
and
at
the
back
of
them
there
be
a
little
shooting

out

five
minute

walk
down

let
himself

<EOS>
the

become
troublesome
 
<EOS>
the
thirtieth
of
July
come
round
,
and
Lizzie
be
prepare
for
her
journey
down
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
be
accompany
by
Miss
Macnulty
and
her
own
maid
and
her
own
servant
,
and
to
travel
,
of
course
,
like
a
grand
lady
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
see
Lord
Fawn
since
the
meeting
record
in
the
last
chapter
,
but
have
see
her
cousin
Frank
nearly
every
other
day
.
<EOS>
He
,
after
much
consideration
,
have
write
a
long
letter
to
Lord
Fawn
,
in
which
he
have
give
that
nobleman
to
understand
that
some
explanation
be
require
as
to
conduct
which
Frank
describe
as
be
to
him
"
at
present
unintelligible
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
go
,
at
considerable
length
,
into
the
matter
of
the
diamond
,
with
the
object
of
prove
that
Lord
Fawn
could
have
no
possible
right
to
interfere
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
and
though
he
have
from
the
first
wish
that
Lizzie
would
give
up
the
trinket
,
he
make
various
point
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
not
only
have
they
be
give
to
his
cousin
by
her
late
husband
,
 
but
even
have
they
not
be
so
give
,
they
would
have
be
her
by
will
.
<EOS>
Sir
Florian
have
leave
her
everything
that
be
within
the
wall
of
Portray
Castle
,
and
the
diamond
have
be
at
Portray
at
the
time
of
Sir
Florian
's
death
.
<EOS>
such
be
Frank
's
statement
,
 
untrue
indeed
,
but
believe
by
him
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
Lizzie
's
lie
,
forge
as
soon
as
she
understand
that
some
subsidiary
claim
may
be
make
upon
them
on
the
ground
that
they
form
a
portion
of
property
leave
by
will
away
from
her
;
 
some
claim
subsidiary
to
the
grand
claim
,
that
the
necklace
be
a
family
heirloom
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
not
in
the
least
shaken
in
his
conviction
that
Lizzie
have
behave
,
and
be
behave
,
badly
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
he
have
better
get
rid
of
her
;
but
he
know
that
he
must
be
very
wary
in
the
reason
he
would
give
for
jilt
her
.
<EOS>
He
write
,
therefore
,
a
very
short
note
to
Greystock
,
promise
that
any
explanation
need
should
be
give
as
soon
as
circumstance
should
admit
of
his
form
a
decision
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
the
30th
of
July
come
,
and
Lady
Eustace
be
ready
for
her
journey
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
or
there
be
,
a
train
leave
London
for
Carlisle
at
11
a.m.
,
by
which
Lizzie
propose
to
travel
,
so
that
she
may
sleep
in
that
city
and
go
on
through
dumfrie
to
portray
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
this
be
her
scheme
;
but
there
be
another
part
of
her
scheme
as
to
which
she
have
feel
much
doubt
.
<EOS>
Should
she
leave
the
diamond
,
or
should
she
take
them
with
her
?
<EOS>
the
iron
box
in
which
they
be
keep
be
small
,
and
so
far
portable
that
a
strong
man
may
carry
it
without
much
trouble
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Lizzie
could
move
it
from
one
part
of
the
room
to
the
other
,
and
she
have
often
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
so
heavy
that
it
could
not
be
take
with
her
without
attract
attention
.
<EOS>
the
servant
would
know
what
it
be
,
and
the
porter
would
know
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
would
know
.
<EOS>
that
her
own
maid
should
know
be
a
matter
of
course
;
but
even
to
her
own
maid
the
journey
of
the
jewel
would
be
remarkable
because
of
the
weight
of
the
box
,
whereas
if
they
go
with
her
other
jewel
in
her
dressing
-
case
,
there
would
be
nothing
remarkable
.
<EOS>
She
may
even
have
take
them
in
her
pocket
,
 
have
she
dare
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
dare
.
<EOS>
though
she
be
intelligent
and
courageous
,
she
be
wonderfully
ignorant
as
to
what
may
<EOS>
and
what
may
not
be
do
for
the
recovery
of
the
necklace
by
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
dare
to
take
them
without
the
iron
box
,
and
at
last
she
decide
that
the
box
should
go
.
<EOS>
at
a
little
after
ten
,
her
own
carriage
,
 
the
job
-
carriage
,
which
be
now
about
to
perform
its
last
journey
in
her
service
,
 
be
at
the
door
,
and
a
cab
be
there
for
the
servant
.
<EOS>
the
luggage
be
bring
down
,
and
with
the
large
box
be
bring
the
iron
case
with
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
the
servant
,
certainly
make
more
of
the
weight
than
he
nee
have
do
,
deposit
it
as
a
foot
-
stool
for
Lizzie
,
who
then
seat
herself
,
and
be
follow
by
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
it
place
in
the
same
way
beneath
her
foot
in
the
railway
carriage
,
and
again
bring
into
her
room
at
the
Carlisle
hotel
.
<EOS>
what
though
the
porter
do
know
!
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
illegal
in
travel
about
with
a
heavy
iron
box
full
of
diamond
,
and
the
risk
would
be
less
this
way
,
she
think
,
than
be
she
to
leave
them
behind
her
in
London
.
<EOS>
the
house
in
Mount
Street
,
which
she
have
take
for
the
season
,
be
to
be
give
up
;
and
whom
could
she
trust
in
London
?
<EOS>
Her
very
banker
,
she
fear
,
would
have
betray
her
,
and
give
up
her
treasure
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
as
for
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
she
feel
sure
that
they
would
be
bribe
by
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
She
once
think
of
ask
her
cousin
to
take
the
charge
of
them
,
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
let
them
out
of
her
own
hand
.
<EOS>
ten
thousand
pound
!
<EOS>
if
she
could
only
sell
them
and
get
the
money
,
from
what
a
world
of
trouble
would
she
be
relieve
.
<EOS>
and
the
sale
,
for
another
reason
,
would
have
be
convenient
;
for
Lady
Eustace
be
already
a
little
in
debt
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
sell
them
,
and
therefore
when
she
get
into
the
carriage
there
be
the
box
under
her
foot
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
very
moment
who
should
appear
on
the
pavement
,
stand
between
the
carriage
and
the
house
-
door
,
but
Mr.
Camperdown
!
<EOS>
and
with
Mr.
Camperdown
there
be
another
man
,
 
a
very
suspicious
-
looking
man
,
 
whom
Lizzie
at
once
take
to
be
a
detective
officer
of
police
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
!
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
,
take
off
his
hat
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
bow
across
Miss
Macnulty
,
and
endeavour
to
restrain
the
tell
-
tale
blood
from
fly
to
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
,
"
that
you
be
now
start
for
Scotland

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be

very
late

Could
you

me
two
minute

conversation
with
you
in

house

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

a
time

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
awkward
hour
,
Lady
Eustace

<EOS>
I
only
hear
this
morning
that
you
be
go
so
soon
,
and
it
be
imperative
that
I
should
see
you

have
you
not

Mr.

We
can
not

<EOS>
I
be
really
very
sorry

Mr.
Camperdown

we
must
not
lose

"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Eustace
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
,
put
his
hand
on
the
carriage
-
door
,
and
so
demean
himself
that
the
coachman
do
not
dare
to
drive
on
,
"
I
must
ask
you
a
question

<EOS>
He
speak
in
a
low
voice
,
but
he
be
speak
across
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
that
lady
,
therefore
,
hear
him
,
and
so
do
William
,
the
servant
,
who
be
stand
close
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
insist
on

where

the
Eustace
diamond

"
<EOS>
Lizzie
feel
the
box
beneath
her
foot
,
and
,
without
show
that
she
do
so
,
somewhat
widen
her
drapery
.
  
<EOS>

I
can
tell
you
nothing

"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
look
at
the
suspicious
man
with
a
frightened
gaze
.
<EOS>
the
suspicious
man
be
,
in
fact
,
a
very
respectable
clerk
in
Mr.
Camperdown
's
employment
,
but
Lizzie
for
a
moment
feel
that
the
search
be
about
to
begin
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
have
hardly
understand
the
threat
,
and
think
that
the
attorney
be
already
armed
with
the
power
of
which
he
speak
.
<EOS>
She
glance
for
a
moment
at
Miss
Macnulty
,
and
then
at
the
servant
.
<EOS>
Would
they
betray
her
?
<EOS>
if
they
choose
to
use
force
to
her
,
the
box
certainly
may
be
take
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
shall
lose

there
be
now
a

there

-
warrant

both
here
and
in
Ayrshire

and
proceeding
will
be
take
also
against
your

personally

"
<EOS>
so
say
,
Mr.
Camperdown
withdraw
,
and
at
last
the
carriage
be
drive
on
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
happen
,
there
be
time
enough
for
catch
the
train
,
 
and
to
spare
.
<EOS>
the
whole
affair
in
Mount
Street
have
take
less
than
ten
minute
.
<EOS>
but
the
effect
upon
Lizzie
be
very
severe
.
<EOS>
for
a
while
she
could
not
speak
,
and
at
last
she
burst
out
into
hysteric
tear
,
 
not
a
sham
fit
,
 
but
a
true
convulsive
agony
of
sob
.
<EOS>
all
the
world
of
Mount
Street
,
include
her
own
servant
,
have
hear
the
accusation
against
her
.
<EOS>
during
the
whole
morning
she
have
be
wish
that
she
have
never
see
the
diamond
;
but
now
it
be
almost
impossible
that
she
should
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
and
yet
they
be
like
a
load
upon
her
chest
,
a
load
as
heavy
as
though
she
be
compel
to
sit
with
the
iron
box
on
her
lap
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
in
her
sob
she
feel
the
thing
under
her
foot
,
and
know
that
she
could
not
get
rid
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
hate
the
box
,
and
yet
she
must
cling
to
it
now
.
<EOS>
She
be
thoroughly
ashamed
of
the
box
,
and
yet
she
must
seem
to
take
a
pride
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
horribly
afraid
of
the
box
,
and
yet
she
must
keep
it
in
her
own
very
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
and
what
should
she
say
about
the
box
now
to
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
sit
by
her
side
,
stiff
and
scornful
,
offer
her
smell
-
bottle
,
but
not
offer
her
sympathy
?
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
she
say
at
last
,
"
that
horrid
man
have
quite
upset
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wonder
that
you
should
be
upset
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
unjust
,
too
,
 
so
false
,
 
<EOS>
so
 
<EOS>
so
 
<EOS>
so
 
.
<EOS>
They
be
my
own
as
much
as
that
umbrella
be
yours
,
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
tell
you
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
mean
be
,
that
it
be
such
a
pity
there
should
be
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
doubt
,
"
say
Lizzie
;
 
"
<EOS>
how
dare
you
say
there
be
a
doubt
?
<EOS>
My
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
say
that
there
be
not
the
slight
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
barrister
,
and
must
know
well
than
an
attorney
like
that
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
by
this
time
they
be
at
the
Euston
Square
station
,
and
then
there
be
more
trouble
with
the
box
.
<EOS>
the
footman
struggle
with
it
into
the
waiting
-
room
,
and
the
porter
struggle
with
it
from
the
waiting
-
room
to
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
could
not
but
look
at
the
porter
as
he
carry
it
,
and
she
feel
sure
that
the
man
have
be
tell
of
its
content
and
be
struggle
with
the
express
view
of
add
to
her
annoyance
.
<EOS>
the
same
thing
happen
at
Carlisle
,
where
the
box
be
carry
up
into
Lizzie
's
bedroom
by
the
footman
,
and
where
she
be
convince
that
her
treasure
have
become
the
subject
of
conversation
for
the
whole
house
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
people
look
at
her
as
she
walk
down
the
long
platform
with
the
box
still
struggle
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
almost
wish
that
she
have
undertake
its
carriage
herself
,
as
she
think
that
even
she
could
have
manage
with
less
outward
show
of
effort
.
<EOS>
Her
own
servant
seem
to
be
in
league
against
her
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
have
never
before
be
so
generally
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
have
a
conscientious
idea
of
do
her
duty
,
and
who
always
attempt
to
give
an
adequate
return
for
the
bread
she
eat
,
could
not
so
far
overcome
the
effect
of
Mr.
Camperdown
's
visit
as
to
speak
on
any
subject
without
be
stiff
and
hard
.
<EOS>
and
she
suffer
,
too
,
from
the
box
,
 
to
such
a
degree
that
she
turn
over
in
her
mind
the
thought
of
leave
Lizzie
,
if
any
other
possible
home
may
be
find
for
her
.
<EOS>
who
would
willingly
live
with
a
woman
who
always
travel
about
with
a
diamond
necklace
worth
ten
thousand
pound
,
lock
up
in
an
iron
safe
,
 
and
that
necklace
not
her
own
property
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
last
Lady
Eustace
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
,
and
the
servant
,
 
and
the
iron
box
,
 
reach
Portray
Castle
in
safety
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ianthe
's
Soul
"
 
Lady
Eustace
have
be
rather
cross
on
the
journey
down
to
Scotland
,
and
have
almost
drive
the
unfortunate
Macnulty
to
think
that
Lady
Linlithgow
or
the
workhouse
would
be
well
than
this
young
tyrant
;
but
on
her
arrival
at
her
own
house
she
be
for
awhile
all
smile
and
kindness
.
<EOS>
during
the
journey
she
have
be
angry
without
thought
,
but
be
almost
entitle
to
be
excuse
for
her
anger
.
<EOS>
Could
Miss
Macnulty
have
realise
the
amount
of
oppression
inflict
on
her
patroness
by
the
box
of
diamond
she
would
have
forgive
anything
.
<EOS>
hitherto
there
have
be
some
secrecy
,
or
at
any
rate
some
privacy
attach
to
the
matter
;
but
now
that
odious
lawyer
have
discuss
the
matter
aloud
,
in
the
very
street
,
in
the
presence
of
the
servant
,
and
Lady
Eustace
have
feel
that
it
be
discuss
also
by
every
porter
on
the
railway
from
London
down
to
Troon
,
<EOS>
the
station
in
Scotland
at
which
her
own
carriage
meet
her
to
take
her
to
her
own
castle
.
<EOS>
the
night
at
Carlisle
have
be
terrible
to
her
,
and
the
diamond
have
never
be
for
a
moment
off
her
mind
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
bad
of
it
all
be
that
her
own
man
-
servant
and
maid
-
servant
have
hear
the
claim
which
have
be
so
violently
make
by
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
there
be
people
,
in
that
respect
very
fortunately
circumstance
,
whose
servant
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
know
all
their
affair
,
have
an
interest
in
their
concern
,
sympathise
with
their
demand
,
feel
their
want
,
and
be
absolutely
at
one
with
them
.
<EOS>
but
in
such
case
the
servant
be
really
know
,
and
be
almost
as
completely
a
part
of
the
family
as
the
son
and
daughter
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
disruption
and
quarrel
;
cause
may
arise
for
end
the
exist
condition
of
thing
;
but
while
this
condition
last
,
the
servant
in
such
household
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
only
too
well
inclined
to
fight
the
battle
of
their
employer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Binns
,
the
butler
,
would
almost
foam
at
the
mouth
if
it
be
suggest
to
him
that
the
plate
at
Silvercup
Hall
be
not
the
undoubted
property
of
the
old
squire
;
and
Mrs.
Pouncebox
could
not
be
make
to
believe
,
by
any
amount
of
human
evidence
,
that
the
jewel
which
her
lady
have
wear
for
the
last
fifteen
year
be
not
her
ladyship
's
very
own
.
<EOS>
Binns
would
fight
for
the
plate
,
and
so
would
Pouncebox
for
the
jewel
,
almost
till
they
be
cut
to
piece
.
<EOS>
the
preservation
of
these
treasure
on
behalf
of
those
who
pay
them
their
wage
and
feed
them
,
who
occasionally
scold
them
,
but
always
succour
them
,
would
be
their
point
of
honour
.
<EOS>
no
torture
would
get
the
key
of
the
cellar
from
Binns
;
no
threat
extract
from
Pouncebox
a
secret
of
the
toilet
.
<EOS>
but
poor
Lizzie
Eustace
have
no
Binns
and
no
Pouncebox
.
<EOS>
They
be
plant
that
grow
slowly
.
<EOS>
there
be
still
too
much
of
the
mushroom
about
Lady
Eustace
to
permit
of
her
possess
such
treasure
.
<EOS>
Her
footman
be
six
foot
high
,
be
not
bad
look
,
and
be
call
Thomas
.
<EOS>
She
know
no
more
about
him
,
and
be
far
too
wise
to
expect
sympathy
from
him
,
or
other
aid
than
the
work
for
which
she
pay
him
.
<EOS>
Her
own
maid
be
somewhat
near
to
her
;
but
not
much
near
.
<EOS>
the
girl
's
name
be
Patience
Crabstick
,
and
she
could
do
hair
well
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
know
but
<EOS>
little
more
of
her
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
consider
herself
still
to
be
engage
to
be
married
to
Lord
Fawn
,
 
but
there
be
no
sympathy
to
be
have
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
may
be
induce
to
sympathise
with
her
;
 
but
hardly
after
the
fashion
which
Lizzie
desire
.
<EOS>
and
then
sympathy
in
that
direction
would
be
so
dangerous
<EOS>
should
she
decide
upon
go
on
with
the
Fawn
marriage
.
<EOS>
for
the
present
she
have
quarrel
with
Lord
Fawn
;
 
but
the
very
bitterness
of
that
quarrel
,
and
the
decision
with
which
her
betroth
have
declare
his
intention
of
break
off
the
match
,
make
her
the
more
resolute
that
she
would
marry
him
.
<EOS>
during
her
journey
to
Portray
she
have
again
determine
that
he
should
be
her
husband
;
and
,
if
so
,
advanced
sympathy
,
 
sympathy
that
would
be
pleasantly
tender
with
her
cousin
Frank
,
would
be
dangerous
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
quite
willing
to
accept
even
Miss
Macnulty
's
sympathy
,
if
that
humble
lady
would
give
it
to
her
of
the
kind
she
want
.
<EOS>
She
declare
to
herself
that
she
could
pour
herself
out
on
Miss
Macnulty
's
bosom
,
and
mingle
her
tear
even
with
Miss
Macnulty
's
,
if
only
Miss
Macnulty
would
believe
in
her
.
<EOS>
if
Miss
Macnulty
would
be
enthusiastic
about
the
jewel
,
enthusiastic
as
to
the
wickedness
of
Lord
Fawn
,
enthusiastic
in
praise
Lizzie
herself
,
Lizzie
,
 
so
she
tell
herself
,
 
would
have
shower
all
the
sweet
of
female
friendship
even
on
Miss
Macnulty
's
head
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Macnulty
be
as
hard
as
a
deal
board
.
<EOS>
She
do
as
she
be
bidden
,
thereby
earn
her
bread
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
tenderness
in
her
;
 
<EOS>
no
delicacy
;
 
no
feeling
;
 
no
comprehension
.
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
Lady
Eustace
judge
her
humble
companion
;
and
in
one
respect
she
judge
her
rightly
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
do
not
believe
in
Lady
Eustace
,
and
be
not
sufficiently
gift
to
act
up
to
a
belief
which
she
do
not
entertain
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
the
world
,
in
judging
of
people
who
be
false
and
bad
and
selfish
and
prosperous
to
outward
appearance
,
be
apt
to
be
hard
upon
them
,
and
to
forget
the
punishment
which
generally
accompany
such
fault
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
be
very
false
and
bad
and
selfish
,
 
and
,
we
may
say
,
very
prosperous
also
;
but
in
the
midst
of
all
she
be
thoroughly
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
She
be
never
at
ease
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
green
spot
in
her
life
with
which
she
could
be
content
.
<EOS>
and
though
,
after
a
fashion
,
she
know
herself
to
be
false
and
bad
,
she
be
thoroughly
convinced
that
she
be
ill
-
use
by
everybody
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
be
very
badly
treat
by
Lord
Fawn
;
 
but
she
flatter
herself
that
she
would
be
able
to
make
Lord
Fawn
know
more
of
her
character
before
she
have
do
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Portray
Castle
be
really
a
castle
,
 
not
simply
a
country
mansion
so
call
,
but
a
stone
edifice
with
battlement
and
a
round
tower
at
one
corner
,
and
a
gate
which
look
as
if
it
may
have
have
a
portcullis
,
and
narrow
window
in
a
portion
of
it
,
and
a
cannon
mount
upon
a
low
roof
,
and
an
excavation
call
the
moat
,
 
but
which
be
now
a
fantastic
and
somewhat
picturesque
garden
,
 
run
round
two
side
of
it
.
<EOS>
in
very
truth
,
though
a
portion
of
the
castle
be
undoubtedly
old
,
and
have
be
build
when
strength
be
need
for
defence
and
probably
for
the
custody
of
booty
,
 
the
battlement
,
and
the
round
tower
,
and
the
awe
-
inspire
gateway
have
all
be
add
by
one
of
the
late
Sir
Florians
.
<EOS>
but
the
castle
look
like
a
castle
,
and
be
interesting
.
<EOS>
as
a
house
it
be
not
particularly
eligible
,
the
castle
form
of
domestic
architecture
be
exigeant
in
its
nature
,
and
demand
that
space
,
which
in
less
ambitious
house
can
be
apply
to
comfort
,
shall
be
surrender
to
magnificence
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
hall
,
and
a
fine
dining
-
room
with
plate
-
glass
window
look
out
upon
the
sea
;
but
the
other
sitting
-
room
be
insignificant
,
and
the
bedroom
be
here
and
there
,
and
be
for
the
most
part
small
and
dark
.
<EOS>
that
,
however
,
which
Lizzie
have
appropriate
to
her
own
use
be
a
grand
chamber
,
look
also
out
upon
the
open
sea
.
  
<EOS>
the
castle
stand
upon
a
bluff
of
land
,
with
a
fine
prospect
of
the
Firth
of
Clyde
,
and
with
a
distant
view
of
the
Isle
of
Arran
.
<EOS>
when
the
air
be
clear
,
as
it
often
be
clear
there
,
the
arran
hill
could
be
see
from
Lizzie
's
window
,
and
she
be
proud
of
talk
of
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
in
other
respect
,
perhaps
,
the
castle
be
somewhat
desolate
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
few
stunted
tree
around
it
,
but
timber
have
not
prosper
there
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
grand
kitchen
garden
,
 
or
rather
a
kitchen
garden
which
have
be
intend
to
be
grand
;
 
but
since
Lizzie
's
reign
have
be
commence
,
the
grandeur
have
be
neglect
.
<EOS>
Grand
kitchen
garden
be
expensive
,
and
Lizzie
have
at
once
be
firm
in
reduce
the
under
-
gardener
from
five
man
to
one
and
a
boy
.
<EOS>
the
head
-
gardener
have
of
course
leave
her
at
once
;
but
that
have
not
break
her
heart
,
and
she
have
hire
a
modest
man
at
a
guinea
a
week
instead
of
a
scientific
artist
,
who
be
by
no
means
modest
,
with
a
hundred
and
twenty
pound
a
year
and
coal
,
house
,
milk
,
and
all
other
horticultural
luxury
.
<EOS>
though
Lizzie
be
prosperous
and
have
a
fine
income
,
she
be
already
aware
that
she
could
not
keep
up
a
town
and
country
establishment
and
be
a

<EOS>
there
be
a
flower
garden
and
small
shrubbery
within
the
so

call
moat
;
but
,
otherwise
,
the
ground
of
Portray
Castle
be
not
alluring
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
sombre
,
expose
,
and
,
in
winter
,
very
cold
;
and
,
except
that
the
expanse
of
sea
beneath
the
hill
on
which
stand
the
castle
be
fine
and
open
,
it
have
no
great
claim
to
praise
on
the
score
of
scenery
.
<EOS>
behind
the
castle
,
and
away
from
the
sea
,
the
low
mountain
belong
to
the
estate
stretch
for
some
eight
or
ten
mile

towards

end
of
them
,
where
stand
a
shooting

lodge
,
call
always
the
Cottage
,
the
landscape
become
rough
and
grand
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
cottage
that
Frank
Greystock
be
to
be
shelter
with
his
friend
,
when
he
come
down
to
shoot
what
Lady
Eustace
have
call
her
three
annual
grouse
.
  
<EOS>
She
ought
to
have
be
happy
and
comfortable
.
<EOS>
there
will
,
of
course
,
be
some
to
say
that
a
young
widow
should
not
be
happy
and
comfortable
,
 
that
she
should
be
weep
her
lose
lord
,
and
subject
to
the
desolation
of
bereavement
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
world
go
now
,
young
widow
be
not
miserable
;
and
there
be
,
perhaps
,
a
grow
tendency
in
society
to
claim
from
them
year
by
year
still
less
of
any
misery
that
may
be
avoidable
.
<EOS>
suttee
propensity
of
all
sort
,
from
burn
alive
down
to
bombazine
and
hideous
form
of
clothing
,
be
become
less
and
less
popular
among
the
nation
,
and
woman
be
begin
to
learn
that
,
let
what
misfortune
will
come
upon
them
,
it
be
well
for
them
to
be
as
happy
as
their
nature
will
allow
them
to
be
.
<EOS>
a
woman
may
thoroughly
respect
her
husband
,
and
mourn
him
truly
,
honestly
,
with
her
whole
heart
,
and
yet
enjoy
thoroughly
the
good
thing
which
he
have
leave
behind
for
her
use
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
at
any
rate
,
sorrow
for
the
lost
Sir
Florian
that
make
Lady
Eustace
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
She
have
her
child
.
<EOS>
She
have
her
income
.
<EOS>
She
have
her
youth
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
have
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
new
lover
,
 
and
,
if
she
choose
to
be
quit
of
him
,
not
like
him
well
enough
for
the
purpose
,
she
may
undoubtedly
have
another
whom
she
would
like
better
.
<EOS>
She
have
hitherto
be
thoroughly
successful
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
be
unhappy
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
that
she
want
?
  
<EOS>
She
have
be
a
very
clever
child
,
 
a
clever
,
crafty
child
;
and
now
she
be
become
a
clever
woman
.
<EOS>
Her
craft
remain
with
her
;
but
so
keen
be
her
outlook
upon
the
world
,
that
she
be
begin
to
perceive
that
craft
,
let
it
be
never
so
crafty
,
will
in
the
long
run
miss
its
own
object
.
<EOS>
She
actually
envy
the
simplicity
of
Lucy
Morris
,
for
whom
she
delight
to
find
evil
name
,
call
her
demure
,
a
prig
,
a
sly
puss
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
see
,
 
or
half
see
,
 
that
Lucy
with
her
simplicity
be
strong
than
be
she
with
her
craft
.
<EOS>
She
have
nearly
captivate
Frank
Greystock
with
her
wile
,
but
without
any
wile
Lucy
have
captivate
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
and
a
man
captivate
by
wiles
be
only
captivate
for
a
time
,
whereas
a
man
win
by
simplicity
would
be
win
for
ever
,
 
if
he
himself
be
worth
the
winning
.
<EOS>
and
this
,
too
,
she
feel
,
 
that
let
her
success
be
what
it
may
,
she
could
not
be
happy
unless
she
could
win
a
man
's
heart
.
<EOS>
She
have
win
Sir
Florian
's
,
but
that
have
be
but
for
an
hour
,
 
for
a
month
or
two
.
<EOS>
and
then
Sir
Florian
have
never
really
win
her
.
<EOS>
Could
not
she
be
simple
?
<EOS>
Could
not
she
act
simplicity
so
well
that
the
thing
act
should
be
as
powerful
as
the
thing
itself
;
 
perhaps
even
more
powerful
?
<EOS>
poor
Lizzie
Eustace
!
<EOS>
in
think
over
all
this
,
she
see
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
that
she
should
see
so
much
and
tell
herself
so
many
home
truth
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
truth
she
could
not
see
,
and
therefore
could
not
tell
it
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
a
heart
to
give
.
<EOS>
It
have
become
petrified
during
those
lesson
of
early
craft
in
which
she
have
teach
herself
how
to
get
the
well
of
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
of
Sir
Florian
Eustace
,
of
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
of
Mr.
Camperdown
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
have
now
come
down
to
her
country
house
,
leave
London
and
all
its
charm
before
the
end
of
the
season
,
actuate
by
various
motive
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
the
house
in
Mount
Street
be
take
furnish
,
by
the
month
,
and
the
servant
be
hire
after
the
same
fashion
,
and
the
horse
job
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
be
already
sufficiently
intimate
with
her
account
to
know
that
she
would
save
two
hundred
pound
by
not
remain
another
month
or
three
week
in
London
,
and
sufficiently
observant
of
her
own
affair
to
have
perceive
that
such
saving
be
need
.
<EOS>
and
then
it
appear
to
her
that
her
battle
with
Lord
Fawn
could
be
better
fight
from
a
distance
than
at
close
quarter
.
<EOS>
London
,
too
,
be
become
absolutely
distasteful
to
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
thing
there
that
tend
to
make
her
unhappy
,
and
so
few
that
she
could
enjoy
!
<EOS>
She
be
afraid
of
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
ever
on
the
rack
l
some
dreadful
thing
should
come
upon
her
in
respect
of
the
necklace
,
 
some
horrible
paper
serve
upon
her
from
a
magistrate
,
order
her
appearance
at
Newgate
,
or
perhaps
before
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
or
a
visit
from
policeman
,
who
would
be
empower
to
search
for
and
carry
off
the
iron
box
.
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
so
little
in
her
London
life
to
gratify
her
!
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
win
in
a
fight
;
 
but
to
be
always
fight
be
not
pleasant
.
<EOS>
except
in
those
moment
,
few
and
far
between
,
in
which
she
be
alone
with
her
cousin
Frank
,
 
and
perhaps
in
those
other
moment
in
which
she
wear
her
diamond
,
 
she
have
but
little
in
London
that
she
enjoy
.
<EOS>
She
still
think
that
a
time
would
come
when
it
would
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
under
these
influence
she
have
actually
make
herself
believe
that
she
be
sigh
for
the
country
,
and
for
solitude
;
for
the
wide
expanse
of
her
own
bright
wave
,
 
as
she
have
call
them
,
 
and
for
the
rock
of
dear
Portray
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
Miss
Macnulty
and
Augusta
Fawn
that
she
thirst
for
the
breeze
of
Ayrshire
,
so
that
she
may
return
to
her
book
and
her
thought
.
<EOS>
amidst
the
whirl
of
London
it
be
impossible
either
to
read
or
to
think
.
<EOS>
and
she
believe
it
too
,
 
herself
.
<EOS>
She
so
believe
it
,
that
on
the
first
morning
of
her
arrival
she
take
a
little
volume
in
her
pocket
,
contain
Shelley
's
"
Queen
Mab
,
"
and
essay
to
go
down
upon
the
rock
.
<EOS>
She
have
actually
breakfast
at
nine
,
and
be
out
on
the
sloping
ground
below
the
castle
before
ten
,
have
make
some
boast
to
Miss
Macnulty
about
the
morning
air
.
  
<EOS>
She
scramble
down
,
 
not
very
far
down
,
but
a
little
way
beneath
the
garden
gate
,
to
a
spot
on
which
a
knob
of
rock
crop
out
from
the
scanty
herbage
of
the
incipient
cliff
.
<EOS>
fifty
yard
low
the
real
rock
begin
;
and
,
though
the
real
rock
be
not
very
rocky
,
not
precipitous
or
even
bold
,
and
be
partially
cover
with
salt
-
fed
mosse
down
almost
to
the
sea
,
nevertheless
they
justify
her
in
talk
about
her
rock
-
bind
shore
.
<EOS>
the
shore
be
her
,
 
for
her
life
,
and
it
be
rock
-
bind
.
<EOS>
this
knob
she
have
espy
from
her
window
;
 
and
,
indeed
,
have
be
think
of
it
for
the
last
week
,
as
a
place
appropriate
to
solitude
and
Shelley
.
<EOS>
She
have
stand
on
it
before
,
and
have
stretch
her
arm
with
enthusiasm
towards
the
just
-
visible
mountain
of
Arran
.
<EOS>
on
that
occasion
the
weather
,
perhaps
,
have
be
cool
;
but
now
a
blaze
sun
be
overhead
,
and
when
she
have
be
seat
half
a
minute
,
and
"
Queen
Mab
"
have
be
withdraw
from
her
pocket
,
she
find
that
it
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
do
,
even
with
the
canopy
she
could
make
for
herself
with
her
parasol
.
<EOS>
so
she
stand
up
and
look
about
herself
for
shade
;
 
for
shade
in
some
spot
in
which
she
could
still
look
out
upon
"
her
dear
wide
ocean
,
with
its
glitter
smile
.
<EOS>
"
for
it
be
thus
that
she
would
talk
about
the
mouth
of
the
Clyde
.
<EOS>
shelter
near
her
there
be
none
.
<EOS>
the
scrubby
tree
lay
nearly
half
a
mile
to
the
right
,
 
and
up
the
hill
,
too
.
<EOS>
She
have
once
clamber
down
to
the
actual
shore
,
and
may
do
so
again
.
<EOS>
but
she
doubt
that
there
would
be
shelter
even
there
;
and
the
clambering
up
on
that
former
occasion
have
be
a
nuisance
,
and
would
be
a
bad
nuisance
now
.
<EOS>
think
of
all
this
,
and
feel
the
sun
keenly
,
she
gradually
retrace
her
step
to
the
garden
within
the
moat
,
and
seat
herself
,
Shelley
in
hand
,
within
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
the
bench
be
narrow
,
hard
,
and
break
;
and
there
be
some
snail
which
discompose
her
;
 
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
would
make
the
good
of
it
.
<EOS>
Her
darling
"
Queen
Mab
"
must
be
read
without
the
coarse
,
inappropriate
,
every
-
day
surrounding
of
a
drawing
-
room
;
and
it
be
now
manifest
to
her
that
,
unless
she
could
get
up
much
earlier
in
the
morning
,
or
come
out
to
her
reading
after
sunset
,
the
knob
of
rock
would
not
avail
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
begin
her
reading
,
resolve
that
she
would
enjoy
her
poetry
in
spite
of
the
narrow
seat
.
<EOS>
She
have
often
talk
of
"
Queen
Mab
,
"
and
perhaps
she
think
she
have
read
it
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
in
truth
her
first
attempt
at
that
work
.
<EOS>
"
how
wonderful
be
death
!
<EOS>
death
and
his
brother
,
sleep
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
she
half
-
close
the
volume
,
and
think
that
she
enjoy
the
idea
.
<EOS>
death
,
 
and
his
brother
Sleep
!
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
why
they
should
be
more
wonderful
than
action
,
or
life
,
or
Thought
;
 
but
the
word
be
of
a
nature
which
would
enable
her
to
remember
them
,
and
they
would
be
good
for
quote
.
"
<EOS>
Sudden
arise
Ianthe
's
soul
;
it

all
-
beautiful

<EOS>
"
the
name
of
ianthe
suit
her
exactly
.
<EOS>
and
the
antithesis
convey
to
her
mind
by
naked
purity
strike
her
strongly
,
and
she
determine
to
learn
the
passage
by
heart
.
<EOS>
eight
or
nine
line
be
print
separately
,
like
a
stanza
,
and
the
labour
would
not
be
great
,
and
the
task
,
when
do
,
would
be
complete
.
<EOS>
"
instinct

inexpressible
beauty
and
grace

stand
Immortal

"
which
be
instinct
with
beauty
,
 
the
stain

the
soul
,
she
do
not
stop
to
inquire
,
and
may
be
excuse
for
not
understand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
"
 
she
exclaim
to
herself
,
"
how
true
it
be
;
how
one
feel
it
;
how
it
come
home
to
one
!
 
<EOS>
"
Sudden
arise
Ianthe
's
soul

"
<EOS>
"
and
then
she
walk
about
the
garden
,
repeat
the
word
to
herself
,
and
almost
forget
the
heat
.
"
<EOS>
"
each
stain
of
earthliness
have
pass
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ha
;
 
yes
.
<EOS>
They
will
pass
away
,
and
become
instinct
with
beauty
and
grace
.
<EOS>
"
a
dim
idea
come
upon
her
that
when
this
happy
time
should
arrive
,
no
one
would
claim
her
necklace
from
her
,
and
that
the
man
at
the
stable
would
not
be
so
disagreeably
punctual
in
send
in
his
bill
.
"
<EOS>
"
all

<EOS>
"
what
a

world
be
this

in
which

perfectly
that
boy

poet
have
understand
it
all
!
"
<EOS>
"
immortal

ruin

<EOS>
"
She
like
the
idea
of
the
ruin
almost
as
well
as
that
of
the
immortality
,
and
the
stain
quite
as
well
as
the
purity

<EOS>
as
immortality
must
come

and
as
stain
be
instinct

why
be
afraid

<EOS>
but
then
,
if

go
wrong

at

they
be
not
ask
out

"
<EOS>
"
Sudden
arise
Ianthe

it
stand
all

"
<EOS>
and
so
the
piece
be
learn
,
and
Lizzie
feel
that
she
have
devote
her
hour
to
poetry
in
a
quite
rapturous
manner
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
she
have
a
bit
to
quote
;
and
though
in
truth
she
do
not
understand
the
exact
bearing
of
the
image
,
she
have
so
study
her
gesture
,
and
so
modulate
her
voice
,
that
she
know
that
she
could
be
effective
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
then
care
to
carry
her
reading
further
,
but
return
with
the
volume
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
though
the
passage
about
Ianthe
's
soul
come
very
early
in
the
work
,
she
be
now
quite
familiar
with
the
poem
,
and
when
,
in
after
day
,
she
speak
of
it
as
a
thing
of
beauty
that
she
have
make
her
own
by
long
study
,
she
actually
do
not
know
that
she
be
lie
.
<EOS>
as
she
grow
old
,
however
,
she
quickly
become
wise
,
and
be
aware
<EOS>
that
in
learn
one
passage
of
a
poem
it
be
expedient
to
select
one
in
the

<EOS>
the
world
be
so
cruelly
observant
now
-
a
-
day
,
that
even
man
and
woman
who
have
not
themselves
read
their
"
Queen
Mab

will
know
from
what
part

morsel
be
extract

will
not
give
you
credit

from
which
your

<EOS>
after
lunch
Lizzie
invite
Miss
Macnulty
to
sit
at
the
open
window
of
the
drawing
-
room
and
look
out
upon
the
"
glitter
wave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
give
Miss
Macnulty
her
due
,
we
must
acknowledge
that
,
though
she
own
no
actual
cleverness
herself
,
have
no
cultivate
taste
,
read
but
little
,
and
that
little
of
a
colourless
kind
,
and
think
nothing
of
her
hour
but
that
she
may
get
rid
of
them
and
live
,
 
<EOS>
yet
she
have
a
certain
power
of
insight
,
and
could
see
a
thing
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
be
utterly
powerless
to
impose
upon
her
.
<EOS>
such
as
Lizzie
be
,
Miss
Macnulty
be
willing
to
put
up
with
her
and
accept
her
bread
.
<EOS>
the
people
whom
she
have
know
have
be
either
worthless
,
 
as
have
be
her
own
father
,
or
cruel
,
 
like
Lady
Linlithgow
,
or
false
,
 
as
be
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
know
that
worthlessness
,
cruelty
,
and
falseness
have
to
be
endure
by
such
as
she
.
<EOS>
and
she
could
bear
them
without
care
much
about
them
;
 
not
condemn
them
,
even
within
her
own
heart
,
very
heavily
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
strangely
deficient
in
this
,
 
that
she
could
not
call
these
quality
by
other
name
,
even
to
the
owner
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
unable
to
pretend
to
believe
Lizzie
's
rhapsody
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
conscience
or
a
grand
spirit
of
truth
that
actuate
her
,
as
much
as
a
want
of
the
courage
need
for
lying
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
have
the
face
to
call
old
Lady
Linlithgow
kind
,
and
therefore
old
Lady
Linlithgow
have
turn
her
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
when
Lady
Eustace
call
on
her
for
sympathy
,
she
have
not
courage
enough
to
dare
to
attempt
the
bit
of
acting
which
would
be
necessary
for
sympathetic
expression
.
<EOS>
She
be
like
a
dog
or
a
child
,
and
be
unable
not
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
long
for
a
little
mock
sympathy
,
 
be
long
to
show
off
her
Shelley
,
and
be
very
kind
to
Miss
Macnulty
when
she
get
the
poor
lady
into
the
recess
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
nice
;
 
be
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
as
she
spread
her
hand
out
through
the
open
space
towards
the
"
wide
expanse
of
glitter
wave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
nice
,
 
only
it
glare
so
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
I
love
the
full
warmth
of
the
real
summer
.
<EOS>
with
me
it
always
seem
that
the
sun
be
need
to
bring
to
true
ripeness
the
fruit
of
the
heart

<EOS>
"
nevertheless
she
have
be
much
trouble
both
by
the
heat
and
by
the
midge
when
she
try
to
sit
on
the
stone
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
think
of
those
few
glorious
day
which
I
pass
with
my
darling
Florian
at
Naples
;
 
day
too
glorious
because
they
be
so
few
.
"
<EOS>
now
Miss
Macnulty
know
some
of
the
history
of
those
day
and
of
their
glory
,
 
and
know
also
how
the
widow
have
bear
her
loss
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
bay
of
Naples
be
fine
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
only
the
bay
.
<EOS>
there
be
scene
there
which
ravish
you

only
it

necessary
that
there
should

you
that
can
understand

<EOS>
soul
of
Ianthe

"
<EOS>
"
she
say
,
mean
to
apostrophise
that
of
the
deceased
Sir
Florian
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
read
"
Queen

?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

that
I

if
I

I

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
 
you
should
read
it

<EOS>
I
know
nothing
in
the
english
language
that
bring
home
to
one
so
often
one
's
own
good
feeling
and
aspiration

<EOS>
"
It
stand
all
-
beautiful
in
naked
purity

"
she
continue
,
still
allude
to
poor
Sir
Florian
's
soul

<EOS>
"
instinct
with
inexpressible
beauty
and
grace
,
each
stain
of
earthliness
have
pass
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
him
now
in
all
his
manly
beauty
,
as
we
use
to
sit
together
by
the
hour
,
look
over
the
water
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Julia
,
the
thing
itself
have
go
,
 
the
earthly
reality
;
but
the
memory
of
it
will
live
for
ever

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
very
handsome
man
,
certainly
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
,
find
herself
force
to
say
something
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
now
,
"
she
go
on
,
still
gaze
out
upon
the
shine
water

<EOS>
"
It
reassume
its
native
dignity
,
and
stand
Primeval
amid
ruin

"
be
not
that
a
glorious
idea
,
gloriously
word
?
"
<EOS>
She
have
forget
one
word
and
use
a
wrong
epithet
;
but
it
sound
just
as
well
.
<EOS>
Primeval
seem
to
her
to
be
a
very
poetical
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
tell
the
truth
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
,
<EOS>
"
I
never
understand
poetry
when
it
be
quote
unless
I
happen
to
know
the
passage
beforehand
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
go
away
from
this
,
for
the
light
be
too
much
for
my
poor
old
eye
.
"
<EOS>
certainly
Miss
Macnulty
have
fall
into
a
profession
for
which
she
be
not
suit
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
procure
a
Pony
for
the
Use
of
Her
Cousin
 
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
could
make
nothing
of
Miss
Macnulty
in
the
way
of
sympathy
,
and
could
not
bear
her
disappointment
with
patience
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
to
be
expect
that
she
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
pay
a
great
deal
for
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
in
a
moment
of
rash
generosity
,
and
at
a
time
when
she
hardly
know
what
money
mean
,
she
have
promise
Miss
Macnulty
seventy
pound
for
the
first
year
,
and
seventy
for
the
second
,
should
the
arrangement
last
longer
than
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
the
second
year
have
be
now
commence
,
and
Lady
Eustace
be
begin
to
think
that
seventy
pound
be
a
great
deal
of
money
when
so
very
little
be
give
in
return
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
have
pay
her
dependant
no
fix
salary
.
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
the
lady
's
"
keep
,
"
and
first
-
class
travelling
when
they
go
up
and
down
to
Scotland
,
and
cab
-
fare
in
London
when
it
be
desirable
that
Miss
Macnulty
should
absent
herself
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
reckon
all
up
,
and
think
that
for
so
much
her
friend
ought
to
be
ready
to
discuss
Ianthe
's
soul
,
or
any
other
kindre
subject
,
at
a
moment
's
warning
,
would
become
angry
,
and
would
tell
herself
that
she
be
be
swindle
out
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
She
know
how
necessary
it
be
that
she
should
have
some
companion
at
the
present
emergency
of
her
life
,
and
therefore
could
not
at
once
send
Miss
Macnulty
away
;
but
she
would
sometimes
become
very
cross
,
and
would
tell
poor
Macnulty
that
she
be
 
a
fool
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
however
,
to
be
call
a
fool
be
less
objectionable
to
Miss
Macnulty
than
be
demand
for
sympathy
which
she
do
not
know
how
to
give
.
  
<EOS>
those
first
ten
day
of
August
go
very
slowly
with
Lady
Eustace
.
"
<EOS>
Queen
Mab
"
get
itself
poke
away
,
and
be
hear
of
no
more
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
other
book
.
<EOS>
a
huge
box
full
of
novel
have
come
down
,
and
Miss
Macnulty
be
a
great
devourer
of
novel
.
<EOS>
if
Lady
Eustace
would
talk
to
her
about
the
sorrow
of
the
poor
heroine
that
ever
see
her
lover
murder
before
her
eye
,
and
then
come
to
life
again
with
ten
thousand
pound
a
year
,
 
for
a
period
of
three
week
,
or
till
another
heroine
,
<EOS>
who
have
herself
be
murder
,
obliterate
the
former
horror
from
her
plastic
mind
,
 
Miss
Macnulty
could
discuss
the
catastrophe
with
the
keen
interest
.
<EOS>
and
Lizzie
,
find
herself
to
be
,
as
she
tell
herself
,
unstrung
,
fall
also
into
novel
-
reading
.
<EOS>
She
have
intend
during
this
vacant
time
to
master
the
"
Faery
Queen
;
"
but
the
"
Faery
Queen
"
fare
even
bad
than
"
Queen
Mab
;
"
 
and
the
study
of
Portray
Castle
be
confine
to
novel
.
<EOS>
for
poor
Macnulty
,
if
she
could
only
be
leave
alone
,
this
be
well
enough
.
<EOS>
to
have
her
meal
,
and
her
daily
walk
,
and
her
fill
of
novel
,
and
to
be
leave
alone
,
be
all
that
she
ask
of
the
god
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
so
with
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
ask
much
more
than
that
,
and
be
now
thoroughly
discontent
with
her
own
idleness
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
that
she
could
have
read
Spenser
from
sunrise
to
sundown
,
with
no
other
break
than
an
hour
or
two
give
to
Shelley
,
 
if
only
there
have
be
some
one
to
sympathise
with
her
in
her
reading
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
one
,
and
she
be
very
cross
.
<EOS>
then
there
come
a
letter
to
her
from
her
cousin
,
 
which
for
that
morning
bring
some
life
back
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
Lord
Fawn
,
"
say
the
letter
,
"
and
I
have
also
see
Mr.
Camperdown

<EOS>
as
it
would
be
very
hard
to
explain
what
take
place
at
these
interview
by
letter
,
and
as
I
shall
be
at
Portray
Castle
on
the
20th

I
will
not
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
We
shall
go
down
by
the
night
train

I
will
get
over
to
you
as
soon
as
I
have
dress
and
have
my
breakfast

I
suppose
I
can
find
some
kind
of

You
need
express
no

declare

<EOS>
Miss

suggest
that
Gowran
should

<EOS>
now
,
Gowran

who
buy
a

see
that
nobody
steal
anything

who
know
the

<EOS>
He
do
not
leave

have
an
idea
in
his

that
it
be

the
great
duty

son

<EOS>
what
more
do
any
human
be
desire
of
such
a
property
than
that
?
  
<EOS>
He
ride
down
to
the
great
doorway
,
 
the
mountain
track
which
fall
on
to
the
road
about
half
a
mile
from
the
castle
have
be
plain
enough
,
and
there
he
give
up
the
pony
into
the
hand
of
no
less
a
man
than
Mr.
Gowran
himself
.
<EOS>
Gowran
have
watch
the
pony
come
down
the
mountain
-
side
,
and
have
desire
to
see
of
what
like
be
"
her
leddyship
's
"
cousin
.
<EOS>
in
tell
the
whole
truth
of
Mr.
Gowran
,
it
must
be
acknowledge
that
he
think
that
his
late
master
have
make
a
very
great
mistake
in
the
matter
of
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
imagine
bad
thing
enough
of
Lady
Eustace
,
and
almost
believe
that
she
be
not
now
,
and
have
not
be
before
her
marriage
,
any
well
than
she
should
be
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
Admiral
Greystock
,
as
have
be
the
father
of
his
mistress
,
have
indeed
reach
his
ear
;
but
Andy
Gowran
be
a
suspicious
man
,
and
feel
no
confidence
even
in
an
admiral
,
 
in
regard
to
whom
he
hear
nothing
of
his
having
,
or
have
have
,
a
wife
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
fer
-
rm
opeenion
<EOS>
she
be
jist
naebody
 
and
waur
,
"
he
have
say
more
than
once
to
his
own
wife
,
nod
his
head
with
great
emphasis
at
the
last
word
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
anxious
,
therefore
,
to
see
"
her
leddyship
's
"
cousin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
think
that
he
know
a
gentleman
when
he
see
one
.
<EOS>
He
think
,
also
,
that
he
know
a
lady
,
and
that
he
do
not
see
one
when
he
be
engage
with
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
cousin
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
the
matter
o
'
that
,
ony
man
that
come
the
way
may
be
ca'ed
a
coosin
.
"
<EOS>
so
Mr.
Gowran
be
on
the
grand
sweep
before
the
garden
gate
,
and
take
the
pony
from
Frank
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
be
Lady
Eustace
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
Frank
ask
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
perceive
that
Frank
be
a
gentleman
,
and
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
and
Frank
do
not
come
as
a
man
come
who
call
himself
by
a
false
name
,
and
pretend
to
be
an
honest
cousin
when
in
fact
he
be
something
,
 
<EOS>
oh
,
ever
so
wicked
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
,
who
be
a
stern
moralist
,
be
certainly
disappointed
at
Frank
's
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
in
a
little
sitting
-
room
,
reach
by
a
long
passage
with
step
in
the
middle
,
at
some
corner
of
the
castle
which
seem
a
long
way
from
the
great
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
cheerful
little
room
,
with
chintz

and
a
few
shelf
laden
with

Lizzie
immediately
on
her
marriage

<EOS>
It
look
out
upon
the
sea

and
she
have
almost
teach
herself
to
think
that
here
she
have
sit
with
her

Florian
,
gaze
in
mutual
ecstasy
upon
the
"
wide
expanse
of
glitter

<EOS>
"
She
be
lie
back
in
a
low
arm
-
chair
as
her
cousin
enter
,
and
she
do
not
rise
to
receive
him
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
be
alone
,
Miss
Macnulty
have
receive
a
suggestion
that
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
do
a
little
gardening
in
the
moat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

Frank
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
,
with
her
sweetest
smile
,
as
she
give

.
<EOS>
She
feel
and
understand
the
extreme
intimacy
which
would
be
imply
by
her
not

to
receive
him
.
<EOS>
as
she
could
not
rush
into
his
arm
there
be
no
device
by
which
she
could
more
clearly
show
to
him
how
close
she
regard
his
friendship

<EOS>
"

extricate

her

arrange

charm
of
proffer
intimacy

<EOS>
Her
dress
be
such
as

would
wear
to
receive

yet
it
have
be
study

<EOS>
She
have
no
gem
about
her
<EOS>

what
she
may
well
wear
in
her
ordinary
life
,
and
yet
the
very
ring
on
her
finger
have
not
be
put
on
without
reference
to
her
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
Her
position
have
be
one
of
lounge
ease
,
such
as
a
woman
may
adopt
when
all
alone

give
herself
all
the
luxury
of
solitude

she
have
adopt
it
in
special
reference

<EOS>
now
she
be
in

with
business
before
her

though

of
her
that
she
could
never

her
appearance
in

eye

She
would
take
his
law

because
she
believe
in
it
;

,
as
far
as
she
could
see
as
yet
,
she
would
not

his
advice

back

pull
this

half
distraught

he
have
state
with
as
much
positive
assurance
as
such
a

learn

hold
her

show
what
Frank

think
about
marriage

It
have
not

much
after
noon
when
Frank
Greystock
reach
Portray
Castle
,

it
be
very
nearly
five
when

course

lunch
with

two
lady

conversation
before
lunch
have
be
long
and
interesting
,
they
do
not

down
till
near
three

then
Lizzie
have
take
him
out
to
show
him
the
ground

garden
,

they
have
clamber
together
down
to
the
sea

beach

"
<EOS>
leave
me
here
,
"
she
have
say
,
when
he
insist
on
go
because
of
his
friend
at
the
Cottage
.
<EOS>
when
he
suggest
that
she
would
want
help
to
climb
back
up
the
rock
to
the
castle
,
she
shake
her
head
,
as
though
her
heart
be
too
full
to
admit
of
a
consideration
so
trifling
.
<EOS>
"
My
thought
flow
more
freely
here
with
the
surge
of
the
water
in
my
ear
,
than
they
will
with
that
old
woman
droning
to
me

come
here
often
,

know
every
rock

every
stone

<EOS>
"
that
be
not
exactly
true

as
she
have
never
be
down
but
once
before

"
You
mean
to
come
again
?

<EOS>
He
tell
her
that
of
course
he
should
come
again

"
I
will
name
neither
day
nor
hour

I
have
nothing
to
take
me
away

be
not

this
spot

good

bye

"
<EOS>
He
take
her
in
his
arm
and
kiss
her
,
 
of
course
as
a
brother
;
and
then
he
clamber
up
,
get
on
his
pony
,
and
ride
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
dinna
ken
just
what
to
mak

o
'
him
,
"
say
Gowran
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
May
be
he
be
her
coosin
;
but
coosin
be
nae
that
sib
that
a
weedow
be
to

hail
aboot
jist
ane
as
though
she
be
ony
quean
at
a
fair

"
<EOS>
from
which
it
may
be
infer
that
Mr.
Gowran
have
watch
the
pair
as
they
be
descend
together
towards
the
shore
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
have
so
much
to
think
of
,
ride
back
to
the
Cottage
,
that
when
he
come
to
the
gap
,
instead
of
turn
round
along
the
wall
down
the
valley
,
he
take
the
track
right
on
across
the
mountain
and
lose
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
have
mean
to
be
back
at
the
Cottage
by
three
or
four
,
and
yet
have
make
his
visit
to
the
castle
so
long
,
that
without
any
losing
of
his
way
he
could
not
have
be
there
before
seven
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
when
that
hour
arrive
,
he
be
up
on
the
top
of
a
hill
,
and
could
again
see
Portray
Castle
cluster
down
close
upon
the
sea
,
and
the
thin
belt
of
tree
,
and
the
shine
water
beyond
;
 
but
of
the
road
to
the
Cottage
he
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
he
think
of
return
to
Portray
,
till
he
have
teach
himself
to
perceive
that
the
distance
be
much
great
than
it
have
be
from
the
spot
at
which
he
have
first
see
the
castle
in
the
morning
;
 
and
then
he
turn
his
pony
round
and
descend
on
the
other
side
.
  
<EOS>
His
mind
be
very
full
of
Lizzie
Eustace
,
and
full
also
of
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
to
be
assert
here
that
a
young
man
may
be
perfectly
true
to
a
first
young
woman
while
he
be
fall
in
love
with
a
second
,
the
reader
of
this
story
would
probably
be
offend
.
<EOS>
but
undoubtedly
many
man
believe
themselves
to
be
quite
true
while
undergo
this
process
,
and
many
young
woman
expect
nothing
else
from
their
lover
.
<EOS>
if
only
he
will
come
right
at
last
,
they
be
content
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
do
not
come
right
at
all
,
 
it
be
the
way
of
the
world
,
and
the
game
have
to
be
play
over
again
.
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
,
no
doubt
,
have
live
a
life
too
retire
for
the
learning
of
such
useful
forbearance
,
but
Frank
Greystock
be
quite
a
proficient
.
<EOS>
He
still
consider
himself
to
be
true
to
Lucy
Morris
,
with
a
truth
seldom
find
in
this
degenerate
age
,
 
with
a
truth
to
which
he
intend
to
sacrifice
some
of
the
bright
hope
of
his
life
,
 
with
a
truth
which
,
after
much
thought
,
he
have
generously
prefer
to
his
ambition
.
<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
find
some
shade
of
regret
to
tinge
the
merit
which
he
assume
on
this
head
,
in
respect
of
the
bright
thing
which
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
abandon
;
but
,
if
so
,
the
feeling
only
assist
him
in
defend
his
present
conduct
from
any
aspersion
his
conscience
may
bring
against
it
.
<EOS>
He
intend
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
,
 
without
a
shilling
,
without
position
,
a
girl
who
have
earn
her
bread
as
a
governess
,
simply
because
he
love
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonder
to
himself
that
he
,
a
lawyer
,
a
man
of
the
world
,
a
member
of
Parliament
,
one
who
have
be
steep
up
to
his
shoulder
in
the
way
of
the
world
,
should
still
be
so
pure
as
to
be
capable
of
such
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
so
;
and
the
sacrifice
would
undoubtedly
be
make
,
 
some
day
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
absurd
in
one
conscious
of
such
high
merit
to
be
afraid
of
the
ordinary
social
incident
of
life
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
debauch
break
drunkard
who
should
become
a
teetotaller
,
and
not
the
healthy
hard
-
work
father
of
a
family
who
never
drink
a
drop
of
wine
till
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
He
nee
not
be
afraid
of
a
glass
of
champagne
when
,
on
a
chance
occasion
,
he
go
to
a
picnic
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
be
now
go
to
his
picnic
;
and
,
though
he
mean
to
be
true
to
Lucy
Morris
,
he
have
enjoy
his
glass
of
champagne
with
Lizzie
Eustace
under
the
rock
.
<EOS>
He
be
think
a
good
deal
of
his
champagne
when
he
lose
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
wonderful
woman
be
his
cousin
Lizzie
;
 
and
so
unlike
any
other
girl
he
have
ever
see
!
<EOS>
how
full
she
be
of
energy
,
how
courageous
,
and
,
then
,
how
beautiful
!
<EOS>
no
doubt
her
special
treatment
of
him
be
sheer
flattery
.
<EOS>
He
tell
himself
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
but
,
after
all
,
flattery
be
agreeable
.
<EOS>
that
she
do
like
him
better
than
anybody
else
be
probable
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
no
feeling
of
the
injustice
he
may
do
to
the
heart
of
a
woman
who
at
the
very
moment
that
she
be
express
her
partiality
for
him
,
be
also
express
her
anger
that
another
man
would
not
consent
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
and
then
woman
who
have
have
one
husband
already
be
not
like
young
girl
in
respect
to
their
heart
.
<EOS>
so
at
least
think
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
then
he
remember
the
time
at
which
he
have
intend
to
ask
Lizzie
to
be
his
wife
,
 
the
very
day
on
which
he
would
have
do
so
<EOS>
have
he
be
able
to
get
away
from
that
early
division
at
the
House
,
 
<EOS>
and
he
ask
himself
whether
he
feel
any
regret
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
very
nice
to
come
down
to
Portray
Castle
as
to
his
own
mansion
after
the
work
of
the
court
and
of
the
session
.
<EOS>
have
Lizzie
become
his
wife
,
her
fortune
would
have
help
him
to
the
very
high
step
beneath
the
throne
.
<EOS>
at
present
he
be
almost
nobody
;
 
because
he
be
so
poor
,
and
in
debt
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
,
undoubtedly
;
but
what
do
all
that
matter
in
comparison
with
the
love
of
Lucy
Morris
?
<EOS>
a
man
be
bind
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
and
he
would
be
true
.
<EOS>
only
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
Lucy
must
wait
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
first
kiss
his
cousin
up
in
London
,
she
suggest
that
the
kiss
be
give
as
by
a
brother
,
and
assert
that
it
be
accept
as
by
a
sister
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
demur
,
have
be
allow
the
kiss
.
<EOS>
nothing
of
the
kind
have
be
say
under
the
rock
to
-
day
;
 
but
then
that
fraternal
arrangement
,
when
once
make
and
accept
,
remain
,
no
doubt
,
in
force
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
He
do
like
his
cousin
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
He
like
to
feel
that
he
could
be
her
friend
,
with
the
power
of
domineer
over
her
.
<EOS>
She
,
also
,
be
fond
of
her
own
way
,
and
love
to
domineer
herself
;
but
the
moment
that
he
suggest
to
her
that
there
may
be
a
quarrel
,
she
be
reduce
to
a
prayer
that
he
would
not
desert
her
.
<EOS>
such
a
friendship
have
charm
for
a
young
man
,
especially
if
the
lady
be
pretty
.
<EOS>
as
to
Lizzie
's
prettiness
,
no
man
or
woman
could
entertain
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
a
way
of
make
the
most
of
herself
,
which
it
be
very
hard
to
resist
.
<EOS>
some
young
woman
,
when
they
clamber
over
rock
,
be
awkward
,
heavy
,
unattractive
,
and
troublesome
.
<EOS>
but
Lizzie
have
at
one
moment
touch
him
as
a
fairy
may
have
do
;
have
spring
at
another
from
stone
to
stone
,
require
no
help
;
and
then
,
on
a
sudden
,
have
become
so
powerless
that
he
have
be
force
almost
to
carry
her
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
that
,
probably
,
must
have
be
the
moment
which
induce
Mr.
Gowran
to
liken
her
to
a
quean
at
a
fair
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
undoubtedly
,
there
may
be
trouble
.
<EOS>
Frank
be
sufficiently
experience
in
the
way
of
the
world
to
know
that
trouble
would
sometimes
come
from
young
lady
who
treat
young
man
like
their
brother
,
when
those
young
man
be
engage
to
other
young
lady
.
<EOS>
the
other
young
lady
be
apt
to
disapprove
of
brother
who
be
not
brother
by
absolute
right
of
birth
.
<EOS>
He
know
also
that
all
the
circumstance
of
his
cousin
's
position
would
make
it
expedient
that
she
should
marry
a
second
husband
.
<EOS>
as
he
could
not
be
that
second
husband
,
 
that
matter
be
settle
,
whether
for
good
or
bad
,
 
be
he
not
create
trouble
,
both
for
her
and
for
himself
?
<EOS>
then
there
arise
in
his
mind
a
feeling
,
very
strange
,
but
by
no
means
uncommon
,
that
prudence
on
his
part
would
be
mean
,
because
by
such
prudence
he
would
be
secure
safety
for
himself
as
well
as
for
her
.
<EOS>
what
he
be
do
be
not
only
imprudent
,
 
but
wrong
also
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
but
Lizzie
Eustace
be
a
pretty
young
woman
;
and
,
when
a
pretty
young
woman
be
in
the
case
,
a
man
be
bind
to
think
neither
of
what
be
prudent
,
nor
of
what
be
right
.
<EOS>
such
be
 
perhaps
his
instinct
rather
than
his
theory
.
<EOS>
for
her
sake
,
if
not
for
his
own
,
he
should
have
abstain
.
<EOS>
She
be
his
cousin
,
and
be
so
place
in
the
world
as
specially
to
require
some
strong
hand
to
help
her
.
<EOS>
He
know
her
to
be
,
in
truth
,
heartless
,
false
,
and
greedy
;
but
she
have
so
live
that
even
yet
her
future
life
may
be
successful
.
<EOS>
He
have
call
himself
her
friend
as
well
as
cousin
,
and
be
bind
to
protect
her
from
evil
,
if
protection
be
possible
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
add
to
all
her
difficulty
,
because
she
pretend
to
be
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
it
be
pretence
;
and
yet
,
because
she
be
pretty
,
and
because
he
be
a
man
,
he
could
not
save
her
from
herself
.
<EOS>
"
It
do
not
do
to
be
wise
than
other
man
,
"
he
say
to
himself
as
he
look
round
about
on
the
bare
hill
-
side
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
he
have
altogether
lose
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
between
nine
and
ten
when
he
reach
the
Cottage
.
<EOS>
"

bashful

I
persuade
him
that

to
go
out
alone

see
what
bird
there
be

at
last
I
induce
him

<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
as
they
smoke
and
drink
whiskey
and
water
,
 
probably
suppose
that
to
be
correct
in
Ayrshire

they
be
lead
on
by
the
combine
warmth

spirit
,

<EOS>
Frank
,
some
month
or
six
week
since
,
in
a
moment
of
soft
confidence
,
have
tell
his
friend

his
engagement
with
Lucy
Morris

<EOS>
of
Lizzie
Eustace
he
have

Her
engagement
with
Lord
Fawn

London

be

therefore
,
know

<EOS>
some
distant
rumour

have
reach
him
that
the
course

be
not

quite
smooth

therefore
on
that
subject
he
would
not
speak

at

Greystock
should
first
mention
it

odd
it

two
woman
live
all
alone
in

great
house
like
that

Frank
have
say

about

it

an

bring

Dove
's
opinion
 
Mr.
Thomas
Dove
,
familiarly
know
among
club
-
man
,
attorney
"
clerk
,
and
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
even
among
judge
when
very
far
from
their
seat
of
judgment
,
as
Turtle
Dove
,
be
a
counsel
learn
in
the
law
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
counsel
so
learn
in
the
law
,
that
there
be
no
question
within
the
limit
of
an
attorney
's
capability
of
put
to
him
,
that
he
could
not
answer
with
the
aid
of
his
book
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
have
once
give
an
opinion
,
all
Westminster
could
not
move
him
from
it
,
 
nor
could
chancery
Lane
and
Lincoln
's
Inn
and
the
Temple
add
to
Westminster
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Dove
have
once
be
positive
,
no
man
on
earth
be
more
positive
.
<EOS>
It
behove
him
,
therefore
,
to
be
right
when
he
be
positive
;
and
though
whether
wrong
or
right
he
be
equally
stubborn
,
it
must
be
acknowledge
that
he
be
seldom
prove
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
consequently
the
attorney
believe
in
him
,
and
he
prosper
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
thin
man
,
over
fifty
year
of
age
,
very
full
of
scorn
and
wrath
,
impatient
of
a
fool
,
and
think
most
man
to
be
fool
;
afraid
of
nothing
on
earth
,
 
and
,
so
his
enemy
say
,
of
nothing
elsewhere
;
eat
up
by
conceit
;
fond
of
law
,
but
fonder
,
perhaps
,
of
dominion
;
soft
as
milk
to
those
who
acknowledge
his
power
,
but
a
tyrant
to
all
who
contest
it
;
conscientious
,
thoughtful
,
sarcastic
,
bright
-
witted
,
and
laborious
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
who
never
spare
himself
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
a
case
in
hand
,
though
the
interest
to
himself
in
it
be
almost
nothing
,
he
would
rob
himself
of
rest
for
a
week
should
a
point
arise
which
require
such
labour
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
theory
of
Mr.
Dove
's
life
that
he
would
never
be
beat
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
some
fear
in
this
respect
that
have
keep
him
from
Parliament
and
confine
him
to
the
court
and
the
company
of
attorney
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
in
truth
,
a
married
man
with
a
family
;
but
they
who
know
him
as
the
terror
of
opponent
and
as
the
divulger
of
legal
opinion
,
hear
nothing
of
his
wife
and
child
.
<EOS>
He
keep
all
such
matter
quite
to
himself
,
and
be
not
give
to
much
social
intercourse
with
those
among
whom
his
work
lie
.
<EOS>
out
at
Streatham
,
where
he
live
,
Mrs.
Dove
probably
have
her
circle
of
acquaintance
;
 
but
Mr.
Dove
's
domestic
life
and
his
forensic
life
be
keep
quite
separate
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
present
moment
Mr.
Dove
be
interesting
to
us
solely
as
be
the
learn
counsel
in
whom
Mr.
Camperdown
trust
,
 
to
whom
Mr.
Camperdown
be
willing
to
trust
for
an
opinion
in
so
grave
a
matter
as
that
of
the
Eustace
diamond
.
<EOS>
a
case
be
make
out
and
submit
to
Mr.
Dove
immediately
after
that
scene
on
the
pavement
in
Mount
Street
,
at
which
Mr.
Camperdown
have
endeavour
to
induce
Lizzie
to
give
up
the
necklace
;
and
the
following
be
the
opinion
which
Mr.
Dove
give
:
    
there
be
much
error
about
heirloom
.
<EOS>
many
think
that
any
chattel
may
be
make
an
heirloom
by
any
owner
of
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
the
law
,
however
,
do
recognise
heirloom
;
 
as
to
which
the
Exors
.
<EOS>
or
Admors
.
<EOS>
be
exclude
in
favour
of
the
Successor
;
and
when
there
be
such
heirloom
they
go
to
the
heir
by
special
custom
.
<EOS>
any
devise
of
an
heirloom
be
necessarily
void
,
for
the
will
take
place
after
death
,
and
the
heirloom
be
already
vest
in
the
heir
by
custom
.
<EOS>
We
have
it
from
Littleton
,
that
law
prefer
custom
to
devise
.
  
<EOS>
Brooke
say
,
that
the
good
thing
of
every
sort
may
be
an
heirloom
,
 
such
as
the
good
bed
,
the
good
table
,
the
good
pot
or
pan
.
  
<EOS>
Coke
say
,
that
heirloom
be
so
by
custom
,
and
not
by
law
.
  
<EOS>
Spelman
say
,
in
define
an
heirloom
,
that
it
may
be
"
Omne
utensil
robustius
;
"
which
would
exclude
a
necklace
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
"
Termes
de
Ley
,
"
it
be
define
as
"
Ascun
parcel
des
ustensiles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
be
tell
in
"
Coke
upon
Littleton
,
"
that
Crown
jewel
be
heirloom
,
which
decision
,
 
as
far
as
it
go
,
 
deny
the
right
to
other
jewel
.
  
<EOS>
certain
chattel
may
undoubtedly
be
hold
and
claim
as
be
in
the
nature
of
heirloom
,
 
as
sword
,
pennon
of
honour
,
garter
and
collar
of
S.
S.
See
case
of
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
;
and
that
of
the
Pusey
horn
,
 
Pusey
v.
Pusey
.
<EOS>
the
journal
of
the
House
of
Lords
,
deliver
officially
to
peer
,
may
be
so
claim
.
<EOS>
see
Upton
v.
Lord
Ferrers
.
  
<EOS>
a
devisor
may
clearly
devise
or
limit
the
possession
of
chattel
,
make
them
inalienable
by
devisee
in
succession
.
<EOS>
but
in
such
case
they
will
become
the
absolute
possession
of
the
first
person
seize
in
tail
,
 
even
though
an
infant
,
and
in
case
of
death
without
will
,
would
go
to
the
Exors
.
<EOS>
such
arrangement
,
therefore
,
can
only
hold
good
for
life
in
existence
and
for
21
year
afterwards
.
<EOS>
chattel
so
secured
would
not
be
heirloom
.
<EOS>
see
Carr
v.
Lord
Errol
,
14
Vesey
,
and
Rowland
v.
Morgan
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Eldon
remark
,
that
such
chattel
hold
in
family
be
"
rather
favourite
of
the
court
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
in
the
Ormonde
case
.
<EOS>
executor
,
therefore
,
even
when
set
aside
any
claim
as
for
heirloom
,
ought
not
to
apply
such
property
in
payment
of
debt
unless
oblige
.
  
<EOS>
the
law
allow
of
claim
for
paraphernalia
for
widow
,
and
,
have
adjust
such
claim
,
seem
to
show
that
the
claim
may
be
limit
.
  
<EOS>
if
a
man
deliver
cloth
to
his
wife
,
and
die
,
she
shall
have
it
,
though
she
have
not
fashion
it
into
the
garment
intend
.
  
<EOS>
pearl
and
jewel
,
even
though
only
wear
on
state
occasion
,
may
go
to
the
widow
as
paraphernalia
,
 
but
with
a
limit
.
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
Lady
Douglas
,
she
be
the
daughter
of
an
Irish
Earl
and
widow
of
the
King
's
Sergeant
(
temp

<EOS>
car
.
<EOS>
I.
)
,
it
be
hold
that
£
370
be
not
too
much
,
and
she
be
allow
a
diamond
and
a
pearl
chain
to
that
value
.
  
<EOS>
in
1674
,
Lord
Keeper
Finch
declare
that
he
would
never
allow
paraphernalia
,
except
to
the
widow
of
a
nobleman
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
1721
Lord
Macclesfield
give
Mistress
tip
paraphernalia
to
the
value
of
£
200
,
 
whether
so
persuade
by
law
and
precedent
,
or
otherwise
,
may
be
uncertain
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Talbot
allow
a
gold
watch
as
paraphernalia
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Hardwicke
go
much
further
,
and
decide
that
Mrs.
Northey
be
entitle
to
wear
jewel
to
the
value
of
£
3000
,
 
say
that
value
make
no
difference
;
but
seem
to
have
limit
the
nature
of
her
possession
in
the
jewel
by
declare
her
to
be
entitle
to
wear
them
only
when
full
-
dressed
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
I
think
,
clear
that
the
Eustace
estate
can
not
claim
the
jewel
as
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
They
be
last
mentioned
,
and
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
only
mention
as
an
heirloom
in
the
will
of
the
great
-
grandfather
of
the
present
baronet
,
 
if
these
be
the
diamond
then
name
by
him
.
<EOS>
as
such
,
he
could
not
have
devise
them
to
the
present
claimant
,
as
he
die
in
1820
,
and
the
present
claimant
be
not
yet
two
year
old
.
  
<EOS>
whether
the
widow
could
claim
them
as
paraphernalia
be
more
doubtful
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
Lord
Hardwicke
's
ruling
would
decide
the
case
;
but
,
if
so
,
she
would
,
I
think
,
be
debar
from
sell
,
as
he
limit
the
use
of
jewel
of
less
value
than
these
to
the
wear
of
them
when
full
-
dressed
.
<EOS>
the
use
be
limit
,
possession
with
power
of
alienation
can
not
be
intend
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
's
claim
to
them
as
a
gift
from
her
husband
amount
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
if
they
be
not
her
by
will
,
 
<EOS>
and
it
seem
that
they
be
not
so
,
 
<EOS>
she
can
only
hold
them
as
paraphernalia
belong
to
her
station
.
  
<EOS>
I
presume
it
to
be
capable
of
proof
that
the
diamond
be
not
in
Scotland
when
Sir
Florian
make
his
will
or
when
he
die
.
<EOS>
the
former
fact
may
be
use
as
tend
to
show
his
intention
when
the
will
be
make
.
<EOS>
I
understand
that
he
do
leave
to
his
widow
by
will
all
the
chattel
in
Portray
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
J.
D.
  
15
August
,
18
 
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Camperdown
have
thrice
read
this
opinion
,
he
sit
in
his
chair
an
unhappy
old
man
.
<EOS>
It
be
undoubtedly
the
case
that
he
have
be
a
lawyer
for
upward
of
forty
year
,
and
have
always
believe
that
any
gentleman
could
make
any
article
of
value
an
heirloom
in
his
family
.
<EOS>
the
title
-
deed
of
vast
estate
have
be
confide
to
his
keeping
,
and
he
have
have
much
to
do
with
property
of
every
kind
;
and
now
he
be
tell
that
,
in
reference
to
property
of
a
certain
description
,
 
property
which
,
by
its
nature
,
could
only
belong
to
such
as
they
who
be
his
client
,
 
he
have
be
long
without
any
knowledge
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
He
have
call
this
necklace
an
heirloom
to
John
Eustace
above
a
score
of
time
;
and
now
he
be
tell
by
Mr.
Dove
not
only
that
the
necklace
be
not
an
heirloom
,
but
that
it
could
not
have
be
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
who
trust
much
in
a
barrister
,
 
as
be
natural
with
an
attorney
;
but
he
be
now
almost
inclined
to
doubt
Mr.
Dove
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
hardly
more
at
ease
in
regard
to
the
other
clause
of
the
opinion
.
<EOS>
not
only
could
not
the
estate
claim
the
necklace
as
an
heirloom
,
but
that
greedy
siren
,
that
heartless
snake
,
that
harpy
of
a
widow
,
 
for
it
be
thus
that
Mr.
Camperdown
in
his
solitude
speak
to
himself
of
poor
Lizzie
,
perhaps
throw
in
a
hard
word
or
two
,
 
that
female
swindler
could
claim
it
as
 
paraphernalia
!
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
crumb
of
comfort
for
him
in
the
thought
that
he
could
force
her
to
claim
that
privilege
from
a
decision
of
the
Court
of
Queen
's
Bench
,
and
that
her
greed
would
be
expose
should
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
and
she
could
be
prevent
from
sell
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
seem
to
make
that
quite
clear
.
<EOS>
but
then
there
come
that
other
question
,
as
to
the
inheritance
of
the
property
under
the
husband
's
will
.
<EOS>
that
Sir
Florian
have
not
intend
that
she
should
inherit
the
necklace
,
Mr.
Camperdown
be
quite
certain
.
<EOS>
on
that
point
he
suffer
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
would
he
be
able
to
prove
that
the
diamond
have
never
be
in
Scotland
since
Sir
Florian
's
marriage
?
<EOS>
He
have
trace
their
history
from
that
date
with
all
the
diligence
he
could
use
,
and
he
think
that
he
know
it
.
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
doubtful
whether
he
could
prove
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
have
first
state
,
 
have
so
state
before
she
have
learn
the
importance
of
any
other
statement
,
 
that
Sir
Florian
have
give
her
the
diamond
in
London
,
as
they
pass
through
London
from
Scotland
to
Italy
,
and
that
she
have
carry
them
thence
to
Naples
,
where
Sir
Florian
have
die
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
so
,
they
could
not
have
be
at
Portray
Castle
till
she
take
them
there
as
a
widow
,
and
they
would
undoubtedly
be
regard
as
a
portion
of
that
property
which
Sir
Florian
habitually
keep
in
London
.
<EOS>
that
this
be
so
Mr.
Camperdown
entertain
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
widow
allege
that
Sir
Florian
have
give
the
necklace
to
her
in
Scotland
,
whither
they
have
go
immediately
after
their
marriage
,
and
that
she
herself
have
bring
them
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
marry
on
the
5th
of
September
;
and
by
the
jeweller
"
book
it
be
hard
to
tell
whether
the
trinket
have
be
give
up
to
Sir
Florian
on
the
4th
or
24th
of
September
.
<EOS>
on
the
24th
Sir
Florian
and
his
young
bride
have
undoubtedly
be
in
London
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
anathematise
the
carelessness
of
everybody
connect
with
Messrs.
Garnett
's
establishment
.
<EOS>
"
those
sort
of
people
have
no
more
idea
of
accuracy
than
 
than
 
"
than
he
have
have
of
heirloom
,
his
conscience
whisper
to
him
,
fill
up
the
blank
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
think
he
could
prove
that
the
necklace
be
first
put
into
Lizzie
's
hand
in
London
.
<EOS>
the
middle
-
aged
and
very
discreet
man
at
Messrs.
Garnett
's
,
who
have
give
up
the
jewel
-
case
to
Sir
Florian
,
be
sure
that
he
have
know
Sir
Florian
to
be
a
married
man
when
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
lady
's
maid
who
have
be
in
Scotland
with
Lady
Eustace
,
and
who
be
now
live
in
Turin
,
have
marry
a
courier
,
have
give
evidence
before
an
italian
man
of
law
,
state
that
she
have
never
see
the
necklace
till
she
come
to
London
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
moreover
,
the
probability
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
be
it
likely
that
Sir
Florian
should
take
such
a
thing
down
in
his
pocket
to
Scotland
?
<EOS>
and
there
be
the
statement
as
first
make
by
Lady
Eustace
herself
to
her
cousin
Frank
,
repeat
by
him
to
John
Eustace
,
and
not
to
be
deny
by
any
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
for
her
now
to
say
that
she
have
forget
;
but
would
any
one
believe
that
on
such
a
subject
she
could
forget
?
  
<EOS>
but
still
the
whole
thing
be
very
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
's
opinion
,
if
see
by
Lady
Eustace
and
her
friend
,
would
rather
fortify
them
than
frighten
them
.
<EOS>
be
she
once
to
get
hold
of
that
word
paraphernalia
,
it
would
be
as
a
tower
of
strength
to
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
specially
feel
this
,
 
that
whereas
he
have
hitherto
believe
that
no
respectable
attorney
would
take
up
such
a
case
as
that
of
Lady
Eustace
,
he
could
not
now
but
confess
to
himself
that
any
lawyer
see
Mr.
Dove
's
opinion
would
be
justify
in
take
it
up
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
be
as
certain
as
ever
that
the
woman
be
rob
the
estate
which
it
be
his
duty
to
guard
,
and
that
should
he
cease
to
be
active
in
the
matter
,
the
necklace
would
be
break
up
and
the
property
sell
and
scatter
before
a
year
be
out
,
and
then
the
woman
would
have
get
the
well
of
him
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
shall
find
that
we
have
not
do
with
her
yet
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
as
he
write
a
line
to
John
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
but
John
Eustace
be
out
of
town
,
as
a
matter
of
course
;
 
and
on
the
next
day
Mr.
Camperdown
himself
go
down
and
join
his
wife
and
family
at
a
little
cottage
which
he
have
at
Dawlish
.
<EOS>
the
necklace
,
however
,
interfere
much
with
his
holiday
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
be
very
funny
 
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
certainly
go
over
to
Portray
too
often
,
 
so
often
that
the
pony
be
prove
to
be
quite
necessary
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
hold
her
tongue
and
be
gloomy
,
 
believe
that
Lady
Eustace
be
still
engage
to
Lord
Fawn
,
and
feel
that
in
that
case
there
should
not
be
so
many
visit
to
the
rock
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
be
very
attentive
,
and
could
tell
on
any
day
,
to
five
minute
,
how
long
the
two
cousin
be
sit
together
on
the
sea
-
shore
.
<EOS>
Arthur
Herriot
,
who
care
nothing
for
Lady
Eustace
,
but
who
know
that
his
friend
have
promise
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
,
be
incline
to
be
serious
on
the
subject
;
but
,
 
as
be
always
the
case
with
man
,
 
be
not
willing
to
speak
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
once
,
and
<EOS>
once
only
,
the
two
man
dine
together
at
the
castle
,
 
for
the
doing
of
which
it
be
necessary
that
a
gig
should
be
hire
all
the
way
from
Prestwick
.
<EOS>
Herriot
have
not
be
anxious
to
go
over
,
allege
various
excuse
,
 
the
absence
of
dress
clothe
,
the
call
of
Stone
and
Toddy
,
his
bashfulness
,
and
the
absurdity
of
pay
fifteen
shilling
for
a
gig
.
<EOS>
but
he
go
at
last
,
constrain
by
his
friend
,
and
a
very
dull
evening
he
pass
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
quite
unlike
her
usual
self
,
 
be
silent
,
grave
,
and
solemnly
courteous
;
Miss
Macnulty
have
not
a
word
to
say
for
herself
;
and
even
Frank
be
dull
.
<EOS>
Arthur
Herriot
have
not
try
to
exert
himself
,
and
the
dinner
have
be
a
failure
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
think
much
of
my
cousin
,
I
daresay
,
"
say
Frank
,
as
they
be
drive
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
very
pretty
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
should
say
that
she
do
not
think
much
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
probably
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
on
earth
would
not
you
speak
to
her
?
<EOS>
I
go
on
make
speech
to
Miss
Macnulty
on
purpose
to
give
you
a
chance
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
generally
talk
about
as
well
as
any
young
woman
I
know
;
but
you
have
not
a
word
to
say
to
her
,
nor
she
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
you
devote
yourself
to
Miss
Mac
 
<EOS>
whatever
her
name
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
nonsense
,
"
say
Frank
;
"
Lizzie
and
I
be
more
like
brother
and
sister
than
anything
else
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
one
else
belong
to
her
,
and
she
have
to
come
to
me
for
advice
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
like
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
like
people
,
and
people
never
like
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
saying
that
you
should
know
a
man
seven
year
before
you
poke
his
fire
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
person
seven
year
before
I
can
ask
them
how
they
do
.
<EOS>
to
take
me
out
to
dine
in
this
way
be
of
all
thing
the
most
hopeless
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
dine
out
,
 
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
different
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
routine
of
conversation
go
,
and
one
fall
into
it
.
<EOS>
at
such
affair
as
that
this
evening
one
have
to
be
intimate
,
or
it
be
a
bore
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
say
anything
against
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Her
beauty
be
undeniable
,
and
I
do
not
doubt
her
cleverness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
sometimes
too
clever
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
be
not
become
too
clever
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
get
to
remember
that
you
be
due
elsewhere
;
 
eh
,
old
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
word
that
Herriot
have
say
on
the
subject
,
and
to
that
word
Frank
Greystock
make
no
answer
.
<EOS>
but
it
have
its
effect
,
as
also
do
the
gloomy
look
of
Miss
Macnulty
,
and
the
not
unobserved
presence
of
Mr.
Andy
Gowran
on
various
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
between
them
they
shoot
more
grouse
,
 
so
the
keeper
swear
,
 
than
have
ever
be
shoot
on
these
mountain
before
.
<EOS>
Herriot
absolutely
kill
one
or
two
himself
,
to
his
own
great
delight
,
and
Frank
,
who
be
fairly
skilful
,
would
get
four
or
five
in
a
day
.
<EOS>
there
be
excursion
to
be
make
,
and
the
air
of
the
hill
be
in
itself
a
treat
to
both
of
them
.
<EOS>
though
Greystock
be
so
often
away
at
the
castle
,
Herriot
do
not
find
the
time
hang
heavily
on
his
hand
,
and
be
sorry
when
his
fortnight
be
over
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
stay
a
couple
of
day
longer
,
"
Frank
say
,
when
Herriot
speak
of
their
return
.
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
I
must
see
Lizzie
again
.
<EOS>
She
be
bother
by
business
,
and
I
have
to
see
her
about
a
letter
that
come
this
morning
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
pull
such
a
long
face
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
of
the
kind
you
be
think
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
much
of
what
you
once
say
to
me
about
another
girl
that
I
hope
she
at
any
rate
may
never
be
in
trouble

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
never
may
,
 
on
my
account

say
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
what
trouble
she
may
have
,
 
as
life
will
be
troublesome
<EOS>
,
I
trust
that
I
may
share
and
lessen
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
that
evening
Herriot
go
,
and
on
the
next
morning
Frank
Greystock
again
ride
over
to
Portray
Castle
;
but
when
he
be
alone
after
Herriot
's
departure
,
he
write
a
letter
to
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
He
have
express
a
hope
that
he
may
never
be
a
cause
of
trouble
to
Lucy
Morris
,
and
he
know
that
his
silence
would
trouble
her
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
human
be
less
inclined
to
be
suspicious
than
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
of
that
Frank
be
sure
.
<EOS>
but
there
have
be
an
express
stipulation
with
Lady
Fawn
that
she
should
be
allow
to
receive
letter
from
him
,
and
she
would
naturally
be
vex
when
he
do
not
write
to
her
.
<EOS>
so
he
write
.
  
<EOS>
Portray
Cottage
,
3
September

.
  
<EOS>
dearest
LUCY
,
  
<EOS>
We
have
be
here
for
a
fortnight
,
shooting
grouse
,
wander
about
the
mountain
,
and
go
to
sleep
on
the
hill
-
side
.
<EOS>
You
will
say
that
there
never
be
a
time
so
fit
for
the
writing
of
letter
,
but
that
will
be
because
you
have
not
learn
yet
that
the
idler
people
be
,
the
more
inclined
they
be
to
be
idle
.
<EOS>
We
hear
of
Lord
Chancellors
write
letter
to
their
mother
every
day
of
their
life
;
but
man
who
have
nothing
on
earth
to
do
can
not
bring
themselves
to
face
a
sheet
of
paper
.
<EOS>
I
would
promise
that
when
I
be
Lord
Chancellor
I
would
write
to
you
every
day
,
be
it
not
that
when
that
time
come
I
shall
hope
to
be
always
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
in
truth
,
I
have
have
to
pay
constant
visit
to
my
cousin
,
who
live
in
a
big
castle
on
the
sea
-
side
,
ten
mile
from
here
,
over
the
mountain
,
and
who
be
in
a
peck
of
trouble
;
 
in
spite
of
her
prosperity
one
of
the
unhappiest
woman
,
I
should
say
,
that
you
could
meet
anywhere
.
<EOS>
You
know
so
much
of
her
affair
that
,
without
breach
of
trust
,
I
may
say
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
wish
she
have
a
father
or
a
brother
to
manage
her
matter
for
her
;
but
she
have
none
,
and
I
can
not
desert
her
.
<EOS>
Your
Lord
Fawn
be
behave
badly
to
her
;
and
so
,
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
be
the
people
who
manage
the
Eustace
property
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
you
know
,
be
not
the
most
tractable
of
woman
,
and
altogether
I
have
more
to
do
in
the
matter
than
I
like
.
<EOS>
ride
ten
mile
backwards
and
forwards
so
often
over
the
same
route
on
a
little
pony
be
not
good
fun
,
but
I
be
almost
glad
the
distance
be
not
less
.
<EOS>
otherwise
I
may
have
be
always
there
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
do
not
quite
like
Lizzie
,
but
she
be
to
be
pity
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
up
to
London
on
Friday
,
but
shall
only
be
there
for
one
or
two
day
,
 
that
is
,
for
one
night
.
<EOS>
I
go
almost
entirely
on
her
business
,
and
must
,
I
fear
,
be
here
again
,
or
at
the
castle
,
before
I
can
settle
myself
either
for
work
or
happiness
.
<EOS>
on
Sunday
night
I
go
down
to
Bobsborough
,
 
where
,
indeed
,
I
ought
to
have
be
earlier
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
can
not
go
to
Richmond
on
the
Saturday
,
and
on
the
Sunday
Lady
Fawn
would
hardly
make
me
welcome
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
Bobsborough
for
about
three
week
,
and
there
,
if
you
have
command
to
give
,
I
will
obey
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
,
however
,
tell
you
the
truth
at
once
,
 
though
it
be
a
truth
you
must
keep
very
much
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
in
the
position
in
which
I
now
stand
as
to
Lord
Fawn
,
 
be
absolutely
force
to
quarrel
with
him
on
Lizzie
's
behalf
,
 
Lady
Fawn
could
hardly
receive
me
with
comfort
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
good
of
woman
;
and
,
as
she
be
your
dear
friend
,
nothing
be
furth
from
me
than
any
idea
of
quarrel
with
her
;
but
of
course
she
take
her
son
's
part
,
and
I
hardly
know
how
all
allusion
to
the
subject
could
be
avoid
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
dear
,
need
ruffle
<EOS>
no
feather
between
you
and
me
,
who
love
each
other
better
than
we
love
either
the
Fawns
or
the
Lizzies
.
<EOS>
let
me
find
a
line
at
my
chamber
to
say
that
it
be
so
,
and
always
shall
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
God
bless
my
own
darling
,
ever
and
always
your
own
,
  
<EOS>
F.
G.
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
day
he
ride
over
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
He
have
receive
a
letter
from
John
Eustace
,
who
have
find
himself
force
to
run
up
to
London
to
meet
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
the
lawyer
have
think
to
postpone
further
consideration
of
the
whole
matter
till
he
and
everybody
else
would
be
naturally
in
London
,
 
till
November
that
may
be
,
or
,
perhaps
,
even
till
after
Christmas
.
<EOS>
but
his
mind
be
ill
at
ease
;
and
he
know
that
so
much
may
be
do
with
the
diamond
in
four
month
!
<EOS>
They
may
even
now
be
in
the
hand
of
some
Benjamin
or
of
some
Harter
,
and
it
may
soon
be
beyond
the
power
either
of
lawyer
or
of
policeman
to
trace
them
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
go
up
from
Dawlish
and
persuade
John
Eustace
to
come
from
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
nuisance
,
and
Eustace
freely
anathematise
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
if
only
some
one
would
steal
it
,
so
that
we
may
hear
no
more
of
the
thing
!
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
Mr.
Camperdown
have
frequently
remark
,
the
value
be
too
great
for
trifling
,
and
Eustace
go
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
put
into
his
hand
the
Turtle
Dove
's
opinion
,
explain
that
it
be
by
no
means
expedient
that
it
should
be
show
to
the
other
party
.
<EOS>
Eustace
think
that
the
opinion
should
be
common
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
We
pay
for
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
,
"
and
they
can
get
their
opinion
from
any
other
barrister
if
they
please
.
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
to
be
do
?
<EOS>
Eustace
declare
that
as
to
the
present
whereabout
of
the
necklace
,
he
do
not
in
the
least
doubt
that
he
could
get
the
truth
from
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
write
to
Greystock
,
and
with
that
letter
in
his
pocket
,
Frank
ride
over
to
the
castle
for
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
be
heartily
sick
of
the
necklace
;
 
but
unfortunately
he
be
not
equally
sick
of
her
who
hold
it
in
possession
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
,
too
,
better
alive
to
the
importance
of
the
value
of
the
trinket
than
John
Eustace
,
though
not
so
keenly
as
be
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
be
out
somewhere
among
the
cliff
,
the
servant
say
.
<EOS>
He
regret
this
as
he
follow
her
,
but
he
be
oblige
to
follow
her
.
<EOS>
half
way
down
to
the
sea
-
shore
,
much
below
the
knob
on
which
she
have
attempt
to
sit
with
her
Shelley

She

make
inquiry

personal
ornament

<EOS>
if
I
go
to
London

I
will
take
them
there

wear
them
at
every
house
I
enter

<EOS>
I
will
do
so
in
defiance
of
Mr.
Camperdown

Lord
Fawn

<EOS>
I
think
,
Frank
,
that
no
woman
be
ever
so
ill
-
treat
as
I
be

<EOS>
He
himself
think
that
she
be
ill
-
treat
.
<EOS>
She
have
so
plead
her
case
,
and
have
be
so
lovely
in
her
tear
and
her
indignation
,
that
he
begin
to
feel
something
like
true
sympathy
for
her
cause

<EOS>
what
right
have
he
,

have
Mr.
Camperdown
,
or
any
one
,
to
say
that
the
jewel
do
not
belong
to
her

<EOS>
and
if
her
claim
to
them
be
just
,
why
should
she
be
persuade
to
give
up
the
possession
of
them
?
<EOS>
He
know
well
that
be
she
to
surrender
them
with
the
idea
that
they
should
be
restore
to
her
if
her
claim
be
find
to
be
just
<EOS>
,
she
would
not

them
back
very
soon

<EOS>
if
once
the
jewel
be
safe

lock
up
in
Mr.
Garnett
's
strong
box

Mr.

would
not
care
how
long
it
may
be
before
a
jury
or
a
judge
should
have
decide
on
the
case
.
<EOS>
the
burthen
of
proof
would
then
be
throw
upon
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
in
order
that
she
may
recover
her
own
property
she
would
have
to
thrust
herself
forward
as
a
witness

appear
before
the
world
a
claimant

greedy
for
rich
ornament

why
should
he
advise
her
to
give
them
up

<EOS>
"
I
be
only

he

what
may

the
good
for

how
be
I
to

peace

remember
the

remember
the
manner

that

treat
me

have
be
tell

myself

off

all
that
remain

shall
never

flaunt

eye

they
do

go

revenge

oh
,
Frank
,
I
do
not

I
be
hard

nature

these
thing
make

woman
hard

<EOS>
as
she
speak
she
take
his
hand
in
hers

and
look
up
into
his
eye
through
her
tear
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
you
do
not

you
know
how
much
I
care

<EOS>
"
not
care

you

Lizzie

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

that
little
thing
at
Richmond
be
everything
to
you

She
be
tame
and
quiet
,
 
a
cat
that
will
sleep
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
,
and
you
think
that
she
will
never
scratch
.
<EOS>
do
not
suppose
that
I
mean
to
abuse
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
my
dear
friend
before
you
have
ever
see
her
.
<EOS>
and
man
,
I
know
,
have
taste
which
we
woman
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
You
want
what
you
call
 
repose

<EOS>
"
We
seldom
know
what
we
want
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
We
take
what
the
god
send
us
.
"
<EOS>
Frank
's
word
be
perhaps
more
true
than
wise
.
<EOS>
at
the
present
moment
the
god
have
clearly
send
Lizzie
Eustace
to
him
,
and
unless
he
could
call
up
some
increase
strength
of
his
own
,
quite
independent
of
the
god
,
 
or
of
what
we
may
perhaps
call
chance
,
 
he
would
have
to
put
up
with
the
article
send
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
declare
that
she
would
not
touch
Lord
Fawn
with
a
pair
of
tong
,
and
in
say
so
have
resolve
that
she
could
not
and
would
not
now
marry
his
lordship
<EOS>
even
be
his
lordship
in
her
power
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
decide
by
her
as
quickly
as
thought
flash
,
but
it
be
decide
.
<EOS>
She
would
torture
the
unfortunate
lord
,
but
not
torture
him
by
become
his
wife
.
<EOS>
and
,
so
much
be
fix
as
the
star
in
heaven
,
may
it
be
possible
that
she
should
even
yet
induce
her
cousin
to
take
the
place
that
have
be
intend
for
Lord
Fawn
?
<EOS>
after
all
that
have
pass
between
them
she
nee
hardly
hesitate
to
tell
him
of
her
love
.
<EOS>
and
with
the
same
flashing
thought
she
declare
to
herself
that
she
do
love
him
,
and
that
therefore
this
arrangement
would
be
so
much
well
than
that
other
one
which
she
have
propose
to
herself
.
<EOS>
the
reader
,
perhaps
,
by
this
time
,
have
not
a
high
opinion
of
Lady
Eustace
,
and
may
believe
that
among
other
drawback
on
her
character
there
be
especially
this
,
 
that
she
be
heartless
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
by
no
mean
her
own
opinion
of
herself
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
describe
herself
,
 
and
would
have
mean
to
do
so
with
truth
,
 
as
be
all
heart
.
<EOS>
She
probably
think
that
an
over
-
amount
of
heart
be
the
malady
under
which
she
specially
suffer
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
overflow
now
towards
the
man
who
be
sit
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
and
then
it
would
be
so
pleasant
to
punish
that
little
chit
who
have
spurn
her
gift
and
have
dare
to
call
her
mean
!
<EOS>
this
man
,
too
,
be
needy
,
and
she
be
wealthy
.
<EOS>
surely
,
be
she
to
offer
herself
to
him
,
the
generosity
of
the
thing
would
make
it
noble
.
<EOS>
She
be
still
dissolve
in
tear
and
be
still
hysteric
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Frank
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
and
throw
herself
upon
his
breast
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
feel
his
position
to
be
one
of
intense
difficulty
,
but
whether
his
difficulty
be
increase
or
diminish
by
the
appearance
of
Mr.
Andy
Gowran
's
head
over
a
rock
at
the
entrance
of
the
little
cave
in
which
they
be
sit
,
it
may
be
difficult
to
determine
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
the
head
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
a
head
that
just
pop
itself
up
and
then
retreat
,
as
a
head
would
do
that
be
discover
do
that
which
make
it
ashamed
of
itself
.
<EOS>
the
head
,
with
its
eye
wide
open
,
hold
its
own
,
and
seem
to
say
,
 
"
ay
,
 
I
have
catch
you
,
have
I
?
"
<EOS>
and
the
head
do
speak
,
though
not
exactly
in
those
word
.
<EOS>
"
coosin
!
"
say
the
head
;
and
then
the
head
be
wag
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Lizzie
Eustace
,
whose
back
be
turn
to
the
head
,
raise
her
own
,
and
look
up
into
Greystock
's
eye
for
love
.
<EOS>
She
perceive
at
once
that
something
be
amiss
,
and
,
start
to
her
foot
,
turn
quickly
round
.
"
<EOS>
how
dare
you
intrude
here
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
to
the
head
.
"
<EOS>
coosin
!
"
reply
the
head
,
wag
itself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
clearly
necessary
that
Greystock
should
take
some
step
,
if
only
with
the
object
of
prove
to
the
impudent
factotum
that
he
be
not
altogether
overcome
by
the
awkwardness
of
his
position
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
a
good
deal
annoy
,
and
that
he
feel
not
altogether
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
,
must
be
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
that
the
man
want
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
,
glare
at
the
head
.
"
<EOS>
coosin
!

say
the
head

wag

<EOS>
for

the

<EOS>
when

<EOS>
but
for
Frank
the
difficulty
of
extricate
himself
from

dilemma
be
great
,
not
in

Mr.

in

<EOS>
He
may
,
it
be
true
,
tell
her
that
he
be
engage

then
why
have

He
have
not

She
want
some
demonstration
of
love
from
her
lover

but
very
little
sufficed
for
her
comfort
.
<EOS>
with
her
it
be
almost
impossible
that
a
man
should
be
love
and
suspect
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
love
the
man
,
or
at
any
rate
confess
her
love
,
without
think
well
of
him
;
and
she
could
not
think
good
and
evil
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
She
have
long
for
some
word
from
him
since
she
last
see
him
;
and
now
she
have
get
a
word
.
<EOS>
She
have
know
that
he
be
close
to
his
fair
cousin
,
 
the
cousin
whom
she
despise
,
and
whom
,
with
womanly
instinct
,
she
have
almost
regard
as
a
rival
.
<EOS>
but
to
her
the
man
have
speak
out
;
and
though
he
be
far
away
from
her
,
live
close
to
the
fair
cousin
,
she
would
not
allow
a
thought
of
trouble
on
that
score
to
annoy
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
her
own
,
and
let
Lizzie
Eustace
do
her
bad
,
he
would
remain
her
own
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
long
to
be
tell
that
he
be
think
of
her
,
and
at
last
the
letter
have
come
.
<EOS>
She
answer
it
that
same
night
with
the
sweetest
,
prettiest
little
letter
,
very
short
,
full
of
love
and
full
of
confidence
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
she
say
,
be
the
dear
of
woman
;
 
but
what
be
Lady
Fawn
to
her
,
or
all
the
Fawns
,
compare
with
her
lover
?
<EOS>
if
he
could
come
to
Richmond
without
disturbance
to
himself
,
let
him
come
;
but
if
he
feel
that
,
in
the
present
unhappy
condition
of
affair
between
him
and
Lord
Fawn
,
it
be
well
that
he
should
stay
away
,
she
have
not
a
word
to
say
in
the
way
of
urge
him
.
<EOS>
to
see
him
would
be
a
great
delight
.
<EOS>
but
have
she
not
the
great
delight
of
know
that
he
love
her
?
<EOS>
that
be
quite
enough
to
make
her
happy
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
little
prayer
that
God
may
bless
him
,
and
an
assurance
that
she
be
in
all
thing
his
own
,
own
Lucy

<EOS>
when
she
be
write
her
letter
<EOS>
she
be

a
happy
girl

but
on
the
very
next
day
there
come
a
cloud
upon
her
happiness
,
 
not
in
the
least
,
however
,
affect
her
full
confidence
in
her
lover

<EOS>
It
be
a
Saturday
,
and
Lord

come
down
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
see
Mr.
Greystock
in
London
on
that
day
,
and
the
interview
have
be
by
no
means
pleasant
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
Under

Secretary
of
State
for
India
be
as
dark
as
a
November
day
when
he
reach
his
mother
's
house
,
and
there
fall
upon
every
one
the
unintermittent
cold
drizzling
shower
of
his
displeasure
from
the
moment
in
which
he
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
there
be
never
much
reticence
among
the
lady
at
Richmond
in
Lucy
's
presence
,
and
since
the
completion
of
Lizzie
's
unfortunate
visit
to
Fawn
Court
,
they
have
not
hesitate
to
express
open
opinion
adverse
to
the
prospect
of
the
propose
bride
.
<EOS>
Lucy
herself
could
say
<EOS>
but
little
in
defence
of
her
old
friend
,
who
have
lose
all
claim
upon
that
friendship
since
the
offer
of
the
bribe
have
be
make
,
 
so
that
it
be
understand
among
them
all
that
Lizzie
be
to
be
regard
as
a
black
sheep
;
 
but
hitherto
Lord
Fawn
himself
have
conceal
his
feeling
before
Lucy
.
<EOS>
now
unfortunately
he
speak
out
,
and
in
speaking
be
especially
bitter
against
Frank
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
have
be
most
insolent
,
"
he
say
as
they
be
all
sit
together
in
the
library
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
Lady

make
a
sign
to
him
and
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
Lucy
feel
the
hot
blood
fly
into
both
her
cheek
,
but
at
the
moment
she
do
not
speak
.
<EOS>
Lydia
Fawn
put
out
her
hand
beneath
the
table
and
take
hold
of
Lucy

<EOS>
"
We
must
all
remember
that

"
say
Augusta

<EOS>
"
His
relationship
to

ungentlemanlike

say
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
have
dare
to
use

nothing

Lydia

upon

such
thing
.
<EOS>
let
Lady
Fawn
say
what
she
may
,
Lucy
think
that
the
injury
have
be
do
to
her
,
and
not
to
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
and
so
they
part
hardly
friend
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
give
her
no
kiss
as
she
go
,
and
Lucy
,
with
obstinate
pride
,
altogether
refuse
to
own
her
fault
.
<EOS>
She
would
only
say
that
she
have
better
go
,
and
when
Lady
Fawn
over
and
over
again
point
out
to
her
that
the
last
thing
that
such
a
one
as
Lord
Fawn
could
bear
be
to
be
accuse
of
an
untruth
,
she
would
continue
to
say
that
in
that
case
he
should
be
careful
to
say
nothing
that
be
untrue
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
very
dreadful
,
and
create
great
confusion
and
unhappiness
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Lydia
come
into
her
room
that
night
,
and
the
two
girl
talk
the
matter
over
for
hour
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
Lucy
be
up
early
,
and
find
Lord
Fawn
walk
in
the
ground
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
tell
that
he
would
probably
be
find
walk
in
the
ground
,
if
she
be
willing
to
tender
to
him
any
apology
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mind
have
be
very
full
of
the
subject
,
 
not
only
in
reference
to
her
lover
,
but
as
it
regard
her
own
conduct
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
elder
Fawn
girl
have
assure
her
that
under
no
circumstance
could
a
lady
be
justify
in
tell
a
gentleman
that
he
have
speak
an
untruth
,
and
she
be
not
quite
sure
but
that
the
law
so
lay
down
be
right
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
could
not
but
remember
that
the
gentleman
in
question
be
Lord
Fawn
,
and
that
she
be
Lady
Fawn
's
governess
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Greystock
be
her
affiance
lover
,
and
her
first
duty
be
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
grant
that
she
herself
have
be
wrong
in
accuse
Lord
Fawn
of
untruth
,
she
could
not
refrain
from
ask
herself
whether
he
have
not
be
much
more
wrong
in
say
in
her
hearing
that
Mr.
Greystock
be
not
a
gentleman
?
<EOS>
and
his
offence
have
precede
her
offence
,
and
have
cause
it
!
<EOS>
She
hardly
know
whether
she
do
or
do
not
owe
an
apology
to
Lord
Fawn
,
but
she
be
quite
sure
that
Lord
Fawn
owe
an
apology
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
walk
straight
up
to
Lord
Fawn
,
and
meet
him
beneath
the
tree
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
black
and
solemn
,
and
be
evidently
brood
over
his
grievance
;
but
he
bow
to
her
,
and
stand
still
as
she
approach
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lord
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
be
very
sorry
for
what

last
night

<EOS>
His
face
become
blacker
than
ever
,
but
he
make
no
reply
.
<EOS>
He
want
an
abject
begging
of
unconditional
pardon
from
the
little
girl
who
love
his
enemy

<EOS>
if
that
be
do
,
he
would
vouchsafe
his
forgiveness

he
be
too
small

grant
it

Mr.

him
that
a
plain
duty
lie
upon
him
as
executor

Eustace
have
assert

be
comparatively
a
poor
man

he
would
sooner
replace
the
necklace
out
of

Mr.

if

Lord

<EOS>
"
I
may

that

Mr.

that
I

though
the
value

I
have
advise

give
up
the

it
for
a
while

till
the

that
have
still

she
feel
that
she
be

cruelly
use

with
a

spirit
will
not

yield
anything

Mr.

actually
stop
her

She
would
not
answer
a
line
that
anybody
write

the
lawyer

<EOS>

and
I
may
say
plainly
,
 
for
all
here
<EOS>
know
the
circumstance

strong

who
be
still

I

be
give
to

It
be
at

at
Portray
Castle

"
then
he
shake
hand
with
John

bow
to
Mr.

succeed
in
leave
the

before
Lord
Fawn

so
far
collect
his
sense

be
able

frame
his
anger

<EOS>
"
I
will
never
willingly

but
as
it
be
not
probable
that

would
greatly
desire

this

do
not

<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
groan
over
the
matter
with
thorough
vexation
of
spirit

<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
as
though
the
harpy
,
as
he
call
her
,
would
really
make
good
her
case
against
him
,
 
at
any
rate

would
make
it
seem
to
be
good
for
so
long
a
time
that
all
the
triumph
of
success
would
be
hers
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
she
be
already
in
debt
,
and
give
her
credit
for
a
propensity
to
fast
living
which
almost
do
her
an
injustice
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
the
jewel
would
be
sell
for
half
their
value
,
and
the
harpy
would
triumph
.
<EOS>
of
what
use
to
him
or
to
the
estate
would
be
a
decision
of
the
court
in
his
favour
when
the
diamond
should
have
be
break
up
and
scatter
to
the
wind
of
heaven
?
<EOS>
ten
thousand
pound
!
<EOS>
It
be
,
to
Mr.
Camperdown
's
mind
,
a
thing
quite
terrible
that
,
in
a
country
which
boast
of
its
law
and
of
the
execution
of
its
law
,
such
an
impostor
as
be
this
widow
should
be
able
to
lay
her
dirty
,
grasp
finger
on
so
great
an
amount
of
property
,
and
that
there
should
be
no
means
of
punish
her
.
<EOS>
that
Lizzie
Eustace
have
steal
the
diamond
,
as
a
pickpocket
steal
a
watch
,
be
a
fact
as
to
which
Mr.
Camperdown
have
in
his
mind
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
and
,
as
the
reader
know
,
he
be
right
.
<EOS>
She
have
steal
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
know
that
she
have
steal
them
,
and
be
a
wretched
man
.
<EOS>
from
the
first
moment
of
the
late
Sir
Florian
's
infatuation
about
this
woman
,
she
have
work
woe
for
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
have
strive
hard
,
 
to
the
great
and
almost
permanent
offence
of
Sir
Florian
,
 
to
save
Portray
from
its
present
condition
of
degradation
;
but
he
have
strive
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Portray
belong
to
the
harpy
for
her
life
;
and
moreover
,
he
himself
have
be
force
to
be
instrumental
in
pay
over
to
the
harpy
a
large
sum
of
Eustace
money
almost
immediately
on
her
become
a
widow
.
<EOS>
then
have
come
the
affair
of
the
diamond
;
 
an
affair
of
ten
thousand
pound
!
 
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Camperdown
would
exclaim
to
himself
,
throw
his
eye
up
to
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
and
now
it
seem
that
she
be
to
get
the
well
of
him
even
in
that
,
although
there
could
not
be
a
shadow
of
doubt
as
to
her
falsehood
and
fraudulent
dishonesty
!
<EOS>
His
luck
in
the
matter
be
so
bad
!
<EOS>
John
Eustace
have
no
backbone
,
no
spirit
,
no
proper
feeling
as
to
his
own
family
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
as
weak
as
water
,
and
almost
disgrace
the
cause
by
the
accident
of
his
adherence
to
it
.
<EOS>
Greystock
,
who
would
have
be
a
tower
of
strength
,
have
turn
against
him
,
and
be
now
prepared
to
maintain
that
the
harpy
be
right
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
know
that
the
harpy
be
wrong
,
 
that
she
be
a
harpy
,
and
he
would
not
abandon
the
cause
;
but
the
difficulty
in
his
way
be
great
,
and
the
annoyance
to
which
he
be
subject
be
excessive
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
daughter
be
still
at
Dawlish
,
and
he
be
up
in
town
in
September
,
simply
because
the
harpy
have
the
present
possession
of
these
diamond
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
be
a
man
turn
sixty
,
handsome
,
grey
-
haired
,
healthy
,
somewhat
florid
,
and
carry
in
his
face
and
person
external
sign
of
prosperity
and
that
kind
of
self
-
assertion
which
prosperity
always
produce
.
<EOS>
but
they
who
know
him
best
be
aware
that
he
do
not
bear
trouble
well
.
<EOS>
in
any
trouble
,
such
as
be
this
about
the
necklace
,
there
would
come
over
his

in
ordinary
circumstance
,
be
comfortable

sufficient

and
even
bold

the
line
of

under
difficulty

collapse

become

spiritless

and
insignificant

<EOS>
there
be
face
which
,
in
their
usual
form
,
seem
to
bluster
with
prosperity
,
but
which
the
loss
of
a
dozen
point
at
whist
will
reduce
to
that
currish
aspect
which
remind
one
of
a
dog

whip
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
's
countenance
,
when
Lord
Fawn
and
Mr.
Eustace
leave
him
,
have
fall
away
into
this
meanness
of
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
no
longer
carry
himself
as
a
man
own
a
dog
-
whip
,
but
rather
as
the
hound
that
fear
it
.
  
<EOS>
a
well
attorney
,
for
the
purpose
to
which
his
life
be
devote
,
do
not
exist
in
London
than
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
to
say
that
he
be
honest
,
be
nothing
.
<EOS>
to
describe
him
simply
as
zealous
,
would
be
to
fall
very
short
of
his
merit
.
<EOS>
the
interest
of
his
client
be
his
own
interest
,
and
the
legal
right
of
the
property
of
which
he
have
the
legal
charge
,
be
as
dear
to
him
as
his
own
blood
.
<EOS>
but
it
could
not
be
say
of
him
that
he
be
a
learned
lawyer
.
<EOS>
perhaps
in
that
branch
of
a
solicitor
's
profession
in
which
he
have
be
call
upon
to
work
,
experience
go
further
than
learn
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubt
,
indeed
,
whether
it
be
not
so
in
every
branch
of
every
profession
.
<EOS>
but
it
may
,
perhaps
,
have
be
well
for
Mr.
Camperdown
<EOS>
have
he
devote
more
hour
of
his
youth
to
read
book
on
conveyancing
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
too
old
for
such
study
,
and
could
trust
only
to
the
reading
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
the
reading
,
however
,
of
other
people
be
always
at
his
command
,
and
his
client
be
rich
man
who
do
not
mind
pay
for
an
opinion
.
<EOS>
to
have
an
opinion
from
Mr.
Dove
,
or
some
other
learn
gentleman
,
be
the
every
-
day
practice
of
his
life
;
and
when
he
obtain
,
as
he
often
do
,
little
coign
of
legal
vantage
and
subtle
definition
as
to
property
which
be
comfortable
to
him
,
he
would
rejoice
to
think
that
he
could
always
have
a
Dove
at
his
hand
to
tell
him
exactly
how
far
he
be
justified
in
go
in
defence
of
his
client
"
interest
.
<EOS>
but
now
there
have
come
to
him
no
comfort
from
his
corner
of
legal
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
have
take
extraordinary
pain
in
the
matter
,
and
have
simply
succeed
in
throw
over
his
employer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
necklace
can
not
be
an
heirloom
!
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
to
himself
,
tell
off
on
his
finger
half
-
a
-
dozen
instance
in
which
he
have
either
know
or
have
hear
that
the
head
of
a
family
have
so
arrange
the
future
possession
of
the
family
jewel
.
<EOS>
then
he
again
read
Mr.
Dove
's
opinion
,
and
actually
take
a
law
-
book
off
his
shelf
with
the
view
of
test
the
correctness
of
the
barrister
in
reference
to
some
special
assertion
.
<EOS>
a
pot
or
a
pan
may
be
an
heirloom
,
but
not
a
necklace
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
believe
that
this
be
law
.
<EOS>
and
then
as
to
paraphernalia
!
<EOS>
up
to
this
moment
,
though
he
have
be
call
upon
to
arrange
great
dealing
in
reference
to
widow
,
he
have
never
as
yet
hear
of
a
claim
make
by
a
widow
for
paraphernalia
.
<EOS>
but
then
the
widow
with
whom
he
have
be
call
upon
to
deal
,
have
be
lady
quite
content
to
accept
the
good

prudence
of
their

not

this
Lady

<EOS>
It
be
quite
terrible
to
Mr.

one
of

should
have
fall
into
such
a
pit

to
whom
the

almost
ennoble

<EOS>
then
Mr.

across

by

Lord

to

Old
Square
,
in
which
the
Turtle
Dove
have
build
his
legal
nest
on
a
first
floor
,
close
to
the
old
gateway
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
be
a
gentleman
who
spend
a
very
great
portion
of
his
life
in
this
somewhat
gloomy
abode
of
learn
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
now
term
time
,
and
most
of
his
brother
be
absent
from
London
,
recruit
their
strength
among
the
Alps
,
or
drink
in
vigour
for
fresh
campaign
with
the
salt
sea
breeze
of
Kent
and
Sussex
,
or
perhaps
shoot
deer
in
Scotland
,
or
catch
fish
in
Connemara

<EOS>
but
Mr.
Dove
be
a
man
of
iron
,
who
want
no
such
recreation

<EOS>
to
be
absent
from
his
law

book

the
black

to
him

to
be
wretched

<EOS>
the
only
exercise
necessary
to
him
be
that
of
put
on
his
wig
and
go
into
one
of
the
court
that
be
close
to
his
chamber
;

even
that
be
almost
distasteful
to
him

<EOS>
He
prefer
sit
in
his
old
arm

chair

turn
over
his
old
book
in
search
of

the

also
of
great
gift

the
other
be
simply
an
ordinary
clear

headed
man
of
business

but
they
have
sympathy
in
common
which
make
them
friend
;
they
be
both
honest
and
unwilling
to
sell
their
service
to
dishonest
customer

they
equally
entertain
a
deep

root
contempt
for
that
portion
of
mankind
who
think
that
property
could
be
manage

protect
without

out
that

do

not

<EOS>

I

<EOS>
a
diamond
in
a
star
of
honour
may
form
a
part
of
an
heirloom
;
but
I
do
not
think
that
a
diamond
itself
could
be
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
in
a
star
of
honour
,
why
not
in
a
necklace
?
"
argue
Mr.
Camperdown
almost
triumphantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
a
star
of
honour
,
unless
tamper
with
by
fraud
,
would
naturally
be
maintain
in
its
original
form
.
<EOS>
the
setting
of
a
necklace
will
probably
be
alter
from
generation
to
generation
.
<EOS>
the
one
,
like
a
picture

,
"
say
Mr.

with
sarcasm
.
  
<EOS>
"
pot
and
pan
may
be
precious
,
too
,
"
reply
Mr.

.
<EOS>
"
such
thing
can
be
trace
,
and
can
be
hold
as

without
impose
too
great
difficulty
on
their
guardian

<EOS>
the
Law
be
generally
very
wise

Mr.

often

agree

you
there

Would
the

do
a
service

it
lend
its

be
suppose
never

that
of
speak

the

may

committed
oftener

of

this
Lucy
understand
something

the

lie

she
know
to

abominable

<EOS>
that
Lizzie
Eustace
be
a
little
liar
have
be
acknowledge
between
herself

the

girl
very
often

but
to
have
tell
Lady
Eustace
that
any
word
speak
by
her
be
a
lie

would
have
be
a
bad
crime

itself

<EOS>
to
have
bring
such
an
accusation

in

against

would
have
be
to
degrade

be
there
any
difference

<EOS>
that
one
must
be
,
and
that
the
other
need
not
be

intentional

she
do
feel
;
but
she
feel
also
that
the
less
offensive
word
have
come
to
mean
a
lie

the
world
have
be
drive
so
to
use
it

himself

be
guilty

unmanly
cruelty

falsehood

watch

perplex
in

extreme

She
be
divide
in
her
judgment
and
feeling
between
the
privilege
due
to
Lucy
as
a

possess
of
an
authorise
lover

a
privilege
which
no
doubt
exist

which
be
not
extensive

very

great
privilege
which
attach
to
Lord
Fawn
as
a
man
,
as
a
peer

as
an
Under

which
attach
to
him
especially
as

belong

such
a

move
by

he
condescend
to
come
once

be
entitle

should
on
no
account
be
contradict

any
one

<EOS>
Lucy
no
doubt
have
a
lover
,
 
an
authorised
lover
;
but
perhaps
that
fact
could
not
be
take
as
more
than
a
balance
weight
against
the
inferiority
of
her
position
as
a
governess

<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
be
of
course
oblige
to
take
her
son
's
part

would
scold
Lucy

Lucy
must

scold
very
seriously

so
desirable

induce

do

<EOS>
Amelia
leave
the
culprit
,
feel
that
no
good
have
be
do
,
and
Lady
Fawn
do
not
see
the
delinquent
till
late
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
,
in
the
meantime
,
wander
out
along
the
river
all
alone
to
brood
over
the
condition
of
his
affair
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
an
evil
day
for
him
in
which
he
have
first
see
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
from
the
first
moment
of
his
engagement
to
her
<EOS>
he
have
be
an
unhappy
man
.
<EOS>
Her
treatment
of
him
,
the
story
which
reach
his
ear
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
and
other
,
Mr.
Camperdown
's
threat
of
law
in
regard
to
the
diamond
,
and
Frank
Greystock
's
insult
,
altogether
make
him
aware
that
he
could
not
possibly
marry
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
but
yet
he
have
no
proper
and
become
way
of
escape
from
the
bond
of
his
engagement
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
with
a
conscience
,
and
be
make
miserable
by
the
idea
of
behave
badly
to
a
woman
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
may
have
be
difficult
to
analyse
his
misery
,
and
to
decide
how
much
arise
from
the
feeling
that
he
be
behave
badly
,
and
how
much
from
the
conviction
that
the
world
would
accuse
him
of
do
so
;
but
,
between
the
two
,
he
be
wretched
enough
.
<EOS>
the
punishment
of
the
offence
have
be
commence
by
Greystock
's
unavenged
insult
;
 
and
it
now
seem
to
him
that
this
girl
's
conduct
be
a
continuation
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
world
be
already
begin
to
treat
him
with
that
want
of
respect
which
he
so
greatly
dread
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
too
weak
to
stand
up
against
a
widely
-
spread
expression
of
opinion
that
he
have
behave
badly
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
who
can
walk
about
the
street
with
compose
countenance
,
take
their
seat
in
Parliament
if
they
happen
to
have
seat
,
work
in
their
office
,
or
their
chamber
,
or
their
counting
-
house
with
diligence
,
and
go
about
the
world
serenely
,
even
though
everybody
be
say
evil
of
them
behind
their
back
.
<EOS>
such
man
can
live
down
temporary
calumny
,
and
almost
take
a
delight
in
the
isolation
which
it
will
produce
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
know
well
that
he
be
not
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
describe
his
own
weakness
as
cause
,
perhaps
,
by
a
too
thin
-
skinned
sensitiveness
.
<EOS>
those
who
know
him
be
incline
to
say
that
he
lack
strength
of
character
,
and
,
perhaps
,
courage
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
certainly
engage
himself
to
marry
this
widow
,
and
he
be
most
desirous
to
do
what
be
right
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
that
he
would
not
marry
her
unless
she
would
give
up
the
necklace
,
and
he
be
most
desirous
to
be
true
to
his
word
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
twice
insult
,
and
he
be
anxious
to
support
these
injury
with
dignity
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lucy
's
little
offence
against
him
rankle
in
his
mind
with
the
other
great
offence
.
<EOS>
that
this
humble
friend
of
his
mother
's
should
have
be
so
insolent
be
a
terrible
thing
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
sure
even
whether
his
own
sister
do
not
treat
him
with
scanty
reverence
than
of
yore
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
be
so
anxious
to
do
right
,
and
do
his
duty
in
that
state
of
life
to
which
it
have
please
God
to
call
him
!
<EOS>
as
to
much
he
be
in
doubt
;
but
of
two
thing
he
be
quite
sure
,
 
that
Frank
Greystock
be
a
scoundrel
,
and
that
Lucy
Morris
be
the
most
impertinent
young
woman
in
England
.

that

away

She
have
no
home

such
home
as
she
could
earn
for
herself
by
her
service
as
a
governess

in
her
present
position
it
be
almost
out
of

question
that
she
should

may
be
scold

at

put

awhile

He

you
may
tell

that
I

only
I
shall
always

when

settle
that

<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
's
trouble
 
Frank
Greystock
stay
the
Sunday
in
London
and
go
down
to
Bobsborough
on
the
Monday
.
<EOS>
His
father
and
mother
and
sister
all
know
of
his
engagement
to
Lucy
,
and
they
have
hear
also
that
Lady
Eustace
be
to
become
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
of
the
necklace
they
have
hitherto
hear
very
little
,
and
of
the
quarrel
between
the
two
lover
they
have
hear
nothing
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
many
misgiving
at
the
deanery
,
and
some
regret
,
about
these
marriage
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
,
Frank
's
mother
,
be
,
as
we
be
so
will
not
to
say
of
many
woman
,
the
good
woman
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
be
unselfish
,
affectionate
,
charitable
,
and
thoroughly
feminine
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
think
that
her
son
Frank
,
with
all
his
advantage
,
 
good
look
,
cleverness
,
general
popularity
,
and
seat
in
Parliament
,
 
may
just
as
well
marry
an
heiress
as
a
little
girl
without
twopence
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
as
for
herself
,
who
have
be
bear
a
Jackson
,
she
could
do
with
very
little
;
but
the
Greystocks
be
all
people
who
want
money
.
<EOS>
for
them
there
be
never
more
than
ninepence
in
a
shilling
,
if
so
much
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
race
who
could
not
pay
their
way
with
moderate
income
.
<EOS>
even
the
dear
dean
,
who
really
have
a
conscience
about
money
,
and
who
hardly
ever
leave
Bobsborough
,
could
not
be
keep
quite
clear
of
debt
,
let
her
do
what
she
would
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
admiral
,
the
dean
's
eld
brother
,
he
have
be
notorious
for
insolvency
;
and
Frank
be
a
greystock
all
over
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
very
man
to
whom
money
with
a
wife
be
almost
a
necessity
of
existence
.
  
<EOS>
and
his
pretty
cousin
,
the
widow
,
who
be
devoted
to
him
,
and
would
have
marry
him
at
a
word
,
have
ever
so
many
thousand
a
year
!
<EOS>
of
course
,
Lizzie
Eustace
be
not
just
all
that
she
should
be
;
 
but
then
who
be
?
<EOS>
in
one
respect
,
at
any
rate
,
her
conduct
have
always
be
proper
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
rumour
against
her
as
to
lover
or
flirtation
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
young
,
and
Frank
may
have
mould
her
as
he
please
.
<EOS>
of
course
there
be
regret
.
<EOS>
poor
dear
little
Lucy
Morris
be
as
good
as
gold
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
be
quite
willing
to
admit
that
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
good
-
look
;
 
so
at
least
Mrs.
Greystock
say
.
<EOS>
She
never
would
allow
that
Lucy
be
good
-
looking
.
<EOS>
and
she
do
not
see
much
in
Lucy
,
who
,
accord
to
her
idea
,
be
a
little
chit
of
a
thing
.
<EOS>
Her
position
be
simply
that
of
a
governess
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
declare
to
her
daughter
that
no
one
in
the
whole
world
have
a
high
respect
for
governess
than
have
she
.
<EOS>
but
a
governess
be
a
governess
;
 
and
for
a
man
in
Frank
's
position
such
a
marriage
would
be
simply
suicide
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not

that
,
mamma

now

for
it
be
fix
,

say
Ellinor
Greystock

<EOS>
"
but
I
do
say
it

my

Frank

I
hope
I

<EOS>
"
You
be
a
Jackson

<EOS>
Frank

Greystock

the
very
backbone

<EOS>
if
he
marry
Lucy
Morris
he
must
give
up
Parliament
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
dean
himself
be
more
reticent
and
less
give
to
interference
than
his
wife
;
but
he
feel
it
also
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
for
the
world
have
hint
to
his
son
that
it
may
be
well
to
marry
money
;
but
he
think
that
it
be
a
good
thing
that
his
son
should
go
where
money
be
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
Frank
be
apt
to
spend
his
guinea
faster
than
he
get
them
.
<EOS>
all
his
life
long
the
dean
have
see
what
come
of
such
spending
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
go
out
into
the
world
and
have
prosper
,
 
but
he
could
hardly
continue
to
prosper
unless
he
marry
money
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
there
have
be
regret
when
the
news
come
of
that
fatal
engagement
with
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
for
the
next
ten
year
,
at
any
rate
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
at
one
time
that
he
would
have
make
a
match
with
his
cousin
,
"
say
the
dean
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
;
 
so
do
everybody
,
"
reply
Mrs.
Dean
.
  
<EOS>
then
Frank
come
among
them
.
<EOS>
He
have
intend
stay
some
week
,
 
perhaps
for
a
month
,
and
great
preparation
be
make
for
him
;
but
immediately
on
his
arrival
he
announce
the
necessity
that
be
incumbent
on
him
of
go
down
again
to
Scotland
in
ten
day
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
hear
about
Lizzie
,
of
course
?
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
They
have
hear
that
Lizzie
be
to
become
Lady
Fawn
,
but
beyond
that
they
have
hear
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
about
the
necklace
?
"
ask
Frank
.
<EOS>
something
of
a
tale
of
a
necklace
have
make
its
way
even
down
to
quiet
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
inform
that
there
be
a
dispute
between
the
widow
and
the
executor
of
the
late
Sir
Florian
about
some
diamond
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
behave
about
it
in
the
most
atrocious
manner
,
"
continue
Frank
,
"
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
be
that
there
will
be
no
marriage
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
marriage
!
"
exclaim
Mrs.
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
the
truth
about
the
diamond
?
"
ask
the
dean
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
 
it
will
give
the
lawyer
a
job
before
they
decide
that
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
valuable
;
 
worth
about
ten
thousand
pound
,
I
be
tell
;
but
the
most
of
it
will
go
among
some
of
my
friend
at
the
Chancery
bar
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
I
should
be
out
of
the
scramble
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
should
you
be
out
?
"
ask
his
mother
with
tender
regret
,
 
not
think
of
the
matter
as
her
son
be
think
of
it
,
but
feel
that
when
there
be
so
much
wealth
so
very
near
him
,
he
ought
not
to
let
it
all
go
past
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
"
continue
Frank
,
"
she
have
a
fair
claim
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
will
file
a
bill
in
Chancery
,
and
then
it
will
be
out
of
my
line
altogether
.
<EOS>
She
say
her
husband
give
them
to
her
,
 
absolutely
put
them
on
her
neck
himself
,
and
tell
her
that
they
be
her
.
<EOS>
as
to
their
be
an
heirloom
,
that
turn
out
to
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
it
,
but
it
seem
you
can
not
make
diamond
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
what
astonish
me
be
,
that
Fawn
should
object
to
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
have
object
,
and
have
simply
tell
her
that
he
will
not
marry
her
unless
she
give
them
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
she
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
storm
and
rave
,
 
as
of
course
any
woman
would

<EOS>
I
do
not

she

behave
badly

<EOS>
what
she
want
be
,
to
reduce
him
to
obedience
,
and
then
to
dismiss
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
be
no
more
than
fair
.
<EOS>
nothing
on
earth
would
make
her
marry
him
now

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
ever
care
for
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
she
ever
do
.
<EOS>
She
find
her
position
to
be
troublesome
,
and
she
think
she
have
better
marry
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
be
a
lord
,
 
which
always
go
for
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
you
should
have
so
much
trouble
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
but
in
truth
the
mother
be
not
sorry
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
declare
to
herself
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
that
her
son
should
be
false
to
Lucy
Morris
in
order
that
he
may
marry
his
rich
cousin
;
but
she
do
feel
it
to
be
an
advantage
that
he
should
be
on
term
of
intimacy
with
so
large
an
income
as
that
belong
to
Lady
Eustace
.
"
<EOS>
Doan't
thou
marry
for
munny
,
but
goa
where
munny
be
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
would
have
repudiate
the
idea
of
mercenary
marriage
in
any
ordinary
conversation
,
and
would
have
be
severe
on
any
gentleman
who
be
false
to
a
young
lady
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
so
hard
to
bring
one
's
general
principle
to
bear
on
one
's
own
conduct
or
in
one
's
own
family
;
 
and
then
the
Greystocks
be
so
peculiar
a
people
!
<EOS>
when
her
son
tell
her
that
he
must
go
down
to
Scotland
again
very
shortly
,
she
reconcile
herself
to
his
loss
.
<EOS>
have
he
leave
Bobsborough
for
the
sake
of
be
near
Lucy
at
Richmond
,
she
would
have
feel
it
very
keenly
.
  
<EOS>
day
pass
by
,
and
nothing
be
say
about
poor
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
have
make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
say
nothing
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Lucy
have
behave
badly
in
allow
herself
to
be
love
by
a
man
who
ought
to
have
love
money
,
and
Mrs.
Greystock
have
resolve
that
she
would
show
her
feeling
by
silence
.
<EOS>
the
dean
have
form
no
fix
determination
,
but
he
have
think
that
it
may
be
,
perhaps
,
as
well
to
drop
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Frank
himself
be
unhappy
about
it
;
but
from
morning
to
evening
,
and
from
day
to
day
,
he
allow
it
to
pass
by
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
it
should
not
be
so
,
that
such
silence
be
in
truth
treachery
to
Lucy
;
 
but
he
be
silent
.
<EOS>
what
have
he
mean
when
,
as
he
leave
Lizzie
Eustace
among
the
rock
at
Portray
,
 
in
that
last
moment
,
 
he
have
assure
her
that
he
would
be
true
to
her
?
<EOS>
and
what
have
be
Lizzie
's
meaning
?
<EOS>
He
be
more
sure
of
Lizzie
's
meaning
than
he
be
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
very
rough
world
to
live
in
,
"
he
say
to
himself
in
these
day
as
he
think
of
his
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
be
nearly
a
week
at
the
deanery
,
and
when
the
day
of
his
going
be
so
near
as
to
be
a
matter
of
concern
,
his
sister
do
at
last
venture
to
say
a
word
about
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
be
nothing
settle
about
your
own
marriage
,
Frank
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

will
be
for
some
while

"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
will
be
,
 
for
some
while

<EOS>
"
this
he
say
in
a
tone
which
he
himself
feel
to
be
ill
-
humour
and
almost
petulant
.
<EOS>
and
he
feel
also
that
such
ill
-
humour
on
such
a
subject
be
unkind
,
not
to
his
sister
,
but
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
imply
that
the
matter
of
his
marriage
be
distasteful
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
nothing
can
be
fix
.
<EOS>
Lucy
understand
that
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
in
a
position
at
once
to
marry
a
girl
who
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
,
perhaps
,
that
one
can
not
train
one
's
self
to
like
some
girl
best
that
have
get
money
;
but
as
I
have
not
,
there
must
be
some
delay
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
stay
where
she
be
,
 
at
any
rate

for
a
twelvemonth

but
you
mean
to
see
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
yes
;
I
hardly
know
how
I
can
see
her

I

quarrel

Lord

it

at
Bobsborough
,
till
there
come
a
letter
from
Lucy
to
her
lover
acquaint
him
with
the
circumstance
of
her
unfortunate
position
at
Richmond
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
tell
him
quite
all
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
repeat
the
strong
expression
which
Lord
Fawn
have
use
,
nor
do
she
clearly
explain
how
wrathful
she
have
be
herself
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
be
here
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
there
have
be
ever
so
much
unpleasantness
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
angry
with
you
about
Lady
Eustace
,
and
of
course
Lady
Fawn
take
his
part
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
whose
part
I
take
.
<EOS>
and
so
there
have
be
what
the
servant
call
 
"
just
a
few
word
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
dreadful
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
and
,
after
all
,
Lady
Fawn
have
be
as
kind
as
possible
.
<EOS>
but
the
upshot
of
it
be
,
that
I
be
not
to
stay
here
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
suppose
that
I
be
to
be
turn
out
at
twelve
hour
"
notice
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
stay
till
arrangement
have
be
make
,
and
everybody
will
be
kind
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
what
have
I
better
do
?
<EOS>
I
will
try
and
get
another
situation
at
once
if
you
think
it
best
,
only
I
suppose
I
should
have
to
explain
how
long
I
could
stay
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
know
that
I
be
write
to
you
to
ask
you
what
you
think
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
receipt
of
this
,
Greystock
be
very
much
puzzle
.
<EOS>
what
a
little
fool
Lucy
have
be
,
and
yet
what
a
dear
little
fool
!
<EOS>
who
care
for
Lord
Fawn
and
his
hard
word
?
<EOS>
of
course
,
Lord
Fawn
would
say
all
manner
of
evil
thing
of
him
,
and
would
crow
valiantly
in
his
own
farm
-
yard
;
but
it
would
have
be
so
much
wise
on
Lucy
's
part
to
have
put
up
with
the
crowing
,
and
to
have
disregard
altogether
the
word
of
a
man
so
weak
and
insignificant
!
<EOS>
but
the
evil
be
do
,
and
he
must
make
some
arrangement
for
poor
Lucy
's
comfort
.
<EOS>
have
he
know
exactly
how
matter
stand
,
that
the
proposition
as
to
Lucy
's
departure
have
come
wholly
from
herself
,
and
that
at
the
present
time
all
the
lady
at
Fawn
Court
,
 
of
course
,
in
the
absence
of
Lord
Fawn
,
 
be
quite
disposed
to
forgive
Lucy
if
Lucy
would
only
be
forgive
,
and
hide
herself
when
Lord
Fawn
should
come
;
 
have
Frank
know
all
this
,
he
may
,
perhaps
,
have
counsel
her
to
remain
at
Richmond
.
<EOS>
but
he
believe
that
Lady
Fawn
have
insist
on
Lucy
's
departure
;
and
of
course
,
in
such
a
case
,
Lucy
must
depart
.
<EOS>
He
show
the
letter
to
his
sister
,
and
ask
for
advice
.
<EOS>
"
how
very
unfortunate
!
"
say
Ellinor
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
be
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
she
say
to
Lord
Fawn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
speak
out
very
plainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
have
speak
out
plainly
,
or
otherwise
they
would
never
have
tell
her
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
It
seem
so
unlike
what
I
have
always
hear
of
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lucy
can
be
very
headstrong
if
she
please
,
"
say
Lucy
's
lover
.
<EOS>
"
what
on
earth
have
I
better
do
for
her
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
she
can
get
another
place
that
would
suit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
she
be
to
be
your
wife
,
I
do
not
think
she
should
go
into
another
place
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
quite
fix
,
 
"
she
say
,
and
then
she
look
into
her
brother
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
sure
you
mean
it
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
of
course
I
mean
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
she
have
better
come
here
.
<EOS>
as
for
her
go
out
as
a
governess
,
and
tell
the
people
that
she
be
to
be
your
wife
in
a
few
month
,
that
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
and
it
would
,
I
think
,
be
equally
so
that
she
should
go
into
any
house
and
not
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
this
would
be
the
place
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
at
last
decide
that
Ellinor
should
discuss
the
matter
with
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
whole
matter
be
unfold
to
Mrs.
Greystock
,
that
lady
be
more
troubled
than
ever
.
<EOS>
if
Lucy
be
to
come
to
the
deanery
,
she
must
come
as
Frank
's
affiance
bride
,
and
must
be
treat
as
such
by
all
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
the
dean
would
be
give
his
express
sanction
to
the
marriage
,
and
so
would
Mrs.
Greystock
herself
.
<EOS>
She
know
well
that
she
have
no
power
of
refuse
her
sanction
.
<EOS>
Frank
must
do
as
he
please
about
marrying
.
<EOS>
be
Lucy
once
his
wife
,
of
course
she
would
be
make
welcome
to
the
good
the
deanery
could
give
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
about
Lucy
be
as
good
as
gold
;
 
only
that
real
gold
,
vile
as
it
be
,
be
the
one
thing
that
Frank
so
much
need
.
<EOS>
the
mother
think
that
she
have
discover
in
her
son
something
which
seem
to
indicate
a
possibility
that
this
very
imprudent
match
may
at
last
be
abandon
;
and
if
there
be
such
possibility
,
surely
Lucy
ought
not
now
to
be
bring
to
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
if
Frank
be
to
insist
upon
her
come
,
 
she
must
come
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Greystock
have
a
plan
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
mamma
,
"
say
Ellinor
,
when
the
plan
be
propose
to
her
,
"
do
not
you
think
that
would
be
cruel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
cruel
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
no
;
certainly
not
cruel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
such
a
virago
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
that
because
Lizzie
Eustace
have
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
she
be
a
virago
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
believe
her
to
be
a
very
good
sort
of
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
remember
,
mamma
,
what
the
admiral
use
to
say
of
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
admiral
,
my
dear
,
try
to
borrow
her
money
,
as
he
do
everybody
's
,
and
when
she
would
not
give
him
any
,
then
he
say
severe
thing
.
<EOS>
the
poor
admiral
be
never
to
be
trust
in
such
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
Frank
would
like
it
,
"
say
Ellinor
.
<EOS>
the
plan
be
this
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
,
who
,
through
her
brother
-
in
-
law
,
the
late
Admiral
Greystock
,
be
connect
with
the
dean
's
family
,
have
make
know
her
desire
to
have
a
new
companion
for
six
month
.
<EOS>
the
lady
be
to
be
treat
like
a
lady
,
but
be
to
have
no
salary
.
<EOS>
Her
travelling
expense
be
to
be
pay
for
her
,
and
no
duty
be
to
be
expect
from
her
,
except
that
of
talk
and
listen
to
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
it
be
the
very
thing
for
her
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
like
be
a
governess
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
to
have
any
salary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
that
make
it
well
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
just
be
a
visit
to
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
which
make
the
difference
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ellinor
feel
sure
that
her
brother
would
not
hear
of
such
an
engagement
,
 
but
he
do
hear
of
it
,
and
,
after
various
objection
,
give
a
sort
of
sanction
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
press
upon
Lucy
if
Lucy
dislike
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
be
to
be
make
to
understand
that
Lucy
may
leave
whenever
she
please
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
an
invitation
,
which
Lucy
may
accept
if
she
be
so
minded
.
<EOS>
Lucy
's
position
as
an
honourable
guest
be
to
be
assure
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
think
better
that
Lady
Linlithgow
should
not
be
tell
of
Lucy
's
engagement
unless
she
ask
question
;
 
or
unless
Lucy
should
choose
to
tell
her
.
<EOS>
every
precaution
be
to
be
take
,
and
then
Frank
give
his
sanction
.
<EOS>
He
could
understand
,
he
say
,
that
it
may
be
inexpedient
that
Lucy
should
come
at
once
to
the
deanery
,
<EOS>
as
,
 
be
she
to
do
so
,
 
<EOS>
she
must
remain
there
till
her
marriage
,
let
the
time
be
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
two
year
,
"
say
the
mother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
hardly
so
long
as
that
,
"
say
the
son
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
would
be
 
quite
fair
 
to
papa
,
"
say
the
mother
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
that
the
argument
be
use
behind
the
dean
's
back
,
as
,
have
it
be
make
in
his
hearing
,
the
dean
would
have
upset
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
the
dean
be
so
short
-
sighted
and
imprudent
,
that
he
would
have
profess
delight
at
the
idea
of
have
Lucy
Morris
as
a
resident
at
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
Frank
accede
to
the
argument
,
 
and
be
ashamed
of
himself
for
accede
.
<EOS>
Ellinor
do
not
accede
,
nor
do
her
sister
,
but
it
be
necessary
that
they
should
yield
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
at
once
write
to
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
Frank
write
by
the
same
post
to
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
"
as
there
must
be
a
year
's
delay
,
"
he
write
,
"
we
all
here
think
it
best
that
your
visit
to
us
should
be
postpone
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
object
to
the
Linlithgow
plan
,
say
so
at
once
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
ask
to
do
nothing
disagreeable
.
"
<EOS>
He
find
the
letter
very
difficult
to
write
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
she
ought
to
have
be
welcome
at
once
to
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
and
he
know
,
too
,
the
reason
on
which
his
mother
's
objection
be
found
.
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
two
year
before
he
could
possibly
marry
Lucy
Morris
;
 
or
it
may
be
three
.
<EOS>
Would
it
be
proper
that
she
should
be
desire
to
make
the
deanery
her
home
for
so
long
and
so
indefinite
a
time
?
<EOS>
and
when
an
engagement
be
for
so
long
,
could
it
be
well
that
everybody
should
know
it
,
 
as
everybody
would
if
Lucy
be
to
take
up
her
residence
permanently
at
the
deanery
?
<EOS>
some
consideration
,
certainly
,
be
due
to
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
moreover
,
it
be
absolutely
necessary
that
he
and
Lizzie
Eustace
should
understand
each
other
as
to
that
mutual
pledge
of
truth
which
have
pass
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
he
receive
the
following
letter
from
Messrs.

DEAR

<EOS>
You

by
make
the
necessary

to
her
ladyship

of
her

.
  
<EOS>
We

dear

Your

<EOS>
F.

M.P.
  
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
the
receipt
of
this
letter
Frank

for
Scotland
.
   
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock

<EOS>
on
this
occasion
Frank
Greystock
go
down
to
Portray
Castle
with
the
intention
of

at
the

during
the
very

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
His

,
moreover
,
have

her
,
in
which
case
there
could
be
no
tinge
of
impropriety

.
<EOS>
and
whether
she
have
guest
,
or
whether
she
have
not
,
what
difference
could

really
make
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Andrew
Gowran
have
already
see
what
there
be
to
see
,
and
could
do
all
the
evil
that
could
be
do
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
if
he
be
so
minded
,
spread
report
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
may
,
perhaps
,
have
the
power
of
communicate
what
he
have
discover
to
the
Eustace
faction
,
 
John
Eustace
,
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
Lord

if
it

<EOS>
so

castle
,
and

but
very
graciously
,
by
his
cousin
Lizzie

enough

make

off

hear
so
bad
an
account
of

It

shake
his

go
on
through

aware

the
fence
have
be
repair

go
on

they
will
almost
tempt
me
to
sell
it

what
it
will
fetch

just
to
prove
to
them
that
I
can
do
so

<EOS>
I
have
half
a
mind
to
sell
it
,
and
then
send
them
the
money
,
and
tell
them
to
put
it
by
for

serve

right

be
give

It

from

he
have
not

at

observe
it
as
a
thing

have
never

almost
blush

may

fit

defend
your

after

when
I
ask

what
be

good
of

never

when
I
have
them
on
I
be
always
fear
that
Camperdown

Son
be
behind
me

be
go
to
clutch
them

think
too
well

myself

believe
that
anybody
will
care
more
for
me

of

necklace

the
only
good
they
have
ever
do
me
have

to
save
me
from
a
man

I
now
know
never
care
for
me

they
be
mine

keep

I
be
only

woman

have
an
idea

far
as
they
go

if
you
say
I
ought
not

I
will
keep

not

do
it

very
well

in
the
first

be
very
pretty
in
the
display
of
her
half
-
mock
indignation

though
she
use
some
strong
word
,
she
use
them
with
an
air
that
carry
them
off
and
leave
no
impression
that
she
have
be
either
vulgar
or
violent
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
though
the
indignation
be
half
mock
,
it
be
also
half
real
,
and
her
courage
and
spirit
be
attractive
.
<EOS>
Greystock
have
at
last
teach
himself
to
think
that
Mr.
Camperdown
be
not
justify
in
the
claim
which
he
make

that
in
consequence
of
that
unjust
claim
Lizzie

be
subject

ill

usage

do
you
ever

bone

this
fair
Helen
for
which
Greeks

Romans
be
to
fight

I
never

you
mean
that

will
fetch
it

ought

so
often

Can
I
get
it

ask
Miss
Macnulty

<EOS>
"
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
to
suppose
that
I
should
ever

under
less
than
seven
key

should

lock

seven
key

next

Lizzie

put
her
hand
on

left
side

when
I
sleep
they
be
always
tie
round
my
neck
in
a
bag
,

the
bag
never
escape
from
my
grasp

and
I
have
such
a
knife
under
my
pillow
,
ready
for
Mr.

he
come
to
seize
them

<EOS>
then
she
run
out
of
the
room
,
and
in
a
couple
of
minute
return
with
the
necklace
hang
loose
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
part
of
her
little
play
to
show
by
her
speed
that
the
close
locking
of
the
jewel
be
a
joke
,
and
that
the
ornament
,
precious
as
it
be
,
receive
at
her
hand
no
other
treatment
than
may
any
indifferent
feminine
bauble

<EOS>
nevertheless
within
those
two
minute
she
have
contrive
to
unlock
the
heavy
iron
case

always
stand
beneath
the
foot
of
her
bed

there

chuck
the
necklace
across
the
table

catch
it

perhaps
you
will
not
believe
me
when
I
say
that
I
should
have
the
great
satisfaction
in

throw
them
out

wave
yonder

moment

out

that
afternoon
Frank

a
long
walk
by
himself
over

nearly
to

one
thing

seem
certain

He
be
engage

to

engagement
he
must

cousin
be
very
charming

have
never
look
so
lovely
in
his
eye

when
she
have
be
confess
her
love

he
have
wonder
at
and
admire
her
courage
,
her
power
of
language
,
and
her
force

He
could
not
quite
forget
how
useful
would
be
her
income
to
him

and
,
add
to
this
,
there
be
present
to
him
an
unwholesome
feeling

idea
absolutely
at
variance
with
those
well
idea
which
have
prompt
him
when
he
be
write
his
offer
to
Lucy

into

he
be
engage

next
morning

ask
whether
he
should
see
her
before
he
go
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
necessary
that
he
should
know
what
attorney
to
employ
on
her
behalf
if
the
threaten
bill
be
file
by
Messrs.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
then
he
suggest
a
firm
in
his
note
.
<EOS>
may
he
put
the
case
into
the
hand
of
Mr.
Townsend
,
who
be
a
friend
of
his
own
?
<EOS>
there
come
back
to
him
a
scrap
of
paper
,
an
old
envelope
,
on
which
be
write
the
name
of
Mowbray
and
Mopus
;
 
Mowbray
and
Mopus
in
a
large
scrawling
hand
,
and
with
pencil
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
scrap
of
paper
into
his
pocket
,
feel
that
he
could
not
remonstrate
with
her
at
this
moment
,
and
be
prepare
to
depart
,
when
there
come
a
message
to
him
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
be
still
unwell
,
but
have
rise
;
and
if
it
be
not
give
him
too
much
trouble
,
would
see
him
before
he
go
.
<EOS>
He
follow
the
messenger
to
the
same
little
room
,
look
out
upon
the
sea
,
and
then
find
her
,
dress
indeed
,
but
with
a
white
morning
wrapper
on
,
and
with
hair
loose
over
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
red
with
weeping
,
and
her
face
be
pale
,
and
thin
,
and
woe
-
begone
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
sorry
that
you
be
ill
,
Lizzie
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
ill
;
 
sometimes
very
ill
;
but
what
do
it
matter
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
send
for
you
,
Frank
,
to
speak
of
aught
so
trivial
as
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
favour
to
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
will
grant
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
your
forgiveness
for
my
conduct
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
say
that
you
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
say
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
forgive
where
there
have
be
no
fault
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
fault
.
<EOS>
say
that
you
forgive
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
stamp
her
foot
as
she
demand
his
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
forgive
you
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
one
farewell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
throw
herself
upon
his
breast
and
kiss
him
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
go
,
"
she
say
;
"
go
,
and
come
no
more
to
me
,
unless
you
would
see
me
mad
.
<EOS>
May
God
Almighty
bless
you
,
and
make
you
happy
!
"
<EOS>
as
she
utter
this
prayer
she
hold
the
door
in
her
hand
,
and
there
be
nothing
for
him
but
to
leave
her

<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
in
Scotland
 
<EOS>
a
great
many
people
go
to
Scotland
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
when
you
have
your
autumn
holiday
in
hand
to
dispose
of
it
,
there
be
nothing
more
aristocratic
that
you
can
do
than
go
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
duke
be
more
plentiful
there
than
in
Pall
Mall
,
and
you
will
meet
an
earl
or
at
least
a
lord
on
every
mountain
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
if
you
merely
travel
about
from
inn
to
inn
,
and
neither
have
a
moor
of
your
own
nor
stay
with
any
great
friend
,
you
do
not
quite
enjoy
the
cream
of
it
;
but
to
go
to
Scotland
in
August
and
stay
there
,
perhaps
,
till
the
end
of
September
,
be
about
the
most
certain
step
you
can
take
towards
autumnal
fashion
.
<EOS>
Switzerland
and
the
Tyrol
,
and
even
Italy
,
be
all
redolent
of
Mr.
Cook
,
and
in
those
beautiful
land
you
become
subject
at
least
to
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
by
no
person
be
the
duty
of
adhere
to
the
good
side
of
society
more
clearly
appreciate
than
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
of
Warwick
Square
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hittaway
be
Chairman
of
the
Board
of
Civil
Appeals
,
and
be
a
man
who
quite
understand
that
there
be
chairman
 
and
chairman
.
<EOS>
He
could
name
to
you
three
or
four
man
hold
responsible
permanent
official
position
quite
as
good
as
that
he
fill
in
regard
to
salary
,
 
<EOS>
which
,
as
he
often
say
of
his
own
,
be
a
mere
nothing
,
just
a
poor
two
thousand
pound
a
year
,
not
as
much
as
a
grocer
would
make
in
a
decent
business
,
 
but
they
be
simply
head
clerk
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
nobody
know
anything
of
them
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
name
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
meet
them
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Cabinet
minister
never
hear
of
them
;
and
nobody
out
of
their
own
office
ever
consult
them
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
other
,
and
Mr.
Hittaway
feel
greatly
conscious
that
he
be
one
of
them
,
who
move
altogether
in
a
different
sphere
.
<EOS>
one
minister
of
State
would
ask
another
whether
Hittaway
have
be
consult
on
this
or
on
that
measure
;
 
so
at
least
the
Hittawayites
be
in
the
habit
of
reporting
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
be
constantly
in
the
paper
.
<EOS>
They
be
invite
to
evening
gathering
at
the
house
of
both
the
alternate
Prime
Ministers
.
<EOS>
They
be
to
be
see
at
fashionable
gathering
up
the
river
.
<EOS>
They
attend
concert
at
Buckingham
Palace
.
<EOS>
once
a
year
they
give
a
dinner
-
party
which
be
insert
in
the
"
Morning
Post
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
on
such
occasion
at
least
one
Cabinet
Minister
always
grace
the
board
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Mr.
Hittaway
,
as
Chairman
of
the
Board
of
Civil
Appeals
,
be
somebody
;
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
as
his
wife
and
as
sister
to
a
peer
,
be
somebody
also
.
<EOS>
the
reader
will
remember
that
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
be
a
Fawn
before
she
marry
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
this
drawback
upon
the
happy
condition
which
Mr.
Hittaway
have
achieve
,
 
that
it
demand
a
certain
expenditure
.
<EOS>
let
nobody
dream
that
he
can
be
somebody
without
have
to
pay
for
that
honour
;
 
unless
,
indeed
,
he
be
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
when
you
go
to
a
concert
at
Buckingham
Palace
you
pay
nothing
,
it
be
true
,
for
your
ticket
;
and
a
Cabinet
Minister
dine
with
you
do
not
eat
or
drink
more
than
your
old
friend
Jones
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
but
in
some
insidious
,
unforeseen
manner
,
 
in
a
way
that
can
only
be
understand
after
much
experience
,
 
these
luxury
of
fashion
do
make
a
heavy
pull
on
a
modest
income
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
know
this
thoroughly
,
have
much
experience
,
and
do
make
her
fight
bravely
.
<EOS>
for
Mr.
Hittaway
's
income
be
no
more
than
modest
.
<EOS>
a
few
thousand
pound
he
have
of
his
own
when
he
marry
,
and
his
Clara
have
bring
to
him
the
unpretende
sum
of
fifteen
hundred
.
<EOS>
but
,
beyond
that
,
the
poor
official
salary
,
 
which
be
less
than
what
a
decent
grocer
would
make
,
 
be
their
all
.
<EOS>
the
house
in
Warwick
Square
they
have
prudently
purchase
on
their
marriage
,
 
when
house
in
Warwick
Square
be
cheap
than
they
be
now
,
 
and
there
they
carry
on
their
battle
,
certainly
with
success
.
<EOS>
but
two
thousand
a
year
do
not
go
very
far
in
Warwick
Square
,
even
though
you
sit
rent
free
,
if
you
have
a
family
and
absolutely
must
keep
a
carriage
.
<EOS>
It
therefore
result
that
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
go
to
Scotland
,
which
they
would
endeavour
to
do
every
year
,
it
be
very
important
that
they
should
accomplish
their
aristocratic
holiday
as
visitor
at
the
house
of
some
aristocratic
friend
.
<EOS>
so
well
have
they
play
their
card
in
this
respect
,
that
they
seldom
fail
altogether
.
<EOS>
in
one
year
they
have
be
the
guest
of
a
great
marquis
quite
in
the
north
,
and
that
have
be
a
very
glorious
year
.
<EOS>
to
talk
of
Stackallan
be
,
indeed
,
a
thing
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
but
in
that
year
Mr.
Hittaway
have
make
himself
very
useful
in
London
.
<EOS>
since
that
they
have
be
at
delicious
shooting
lodge
in
Ross
and
Inverness
-
shire
,
have
visit
a
millionaire
at
his
palace
amidst
the
Argyle
mountain
,
have
be
fête
in
a
western
island
,
have
be
bore
by
a
Dundee
dowager
,
and
put
up
with
a
lothian
laird
.
<EOS>
but
the
thing
have
be
almost
always
do
,
and
the
Hittaways
be
know
as
people
that
go
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
He
could
handle
a
gun
,
and
be
clever
enough
never
to
shoot
a
keeper
.
<EOS>
She
could
read
aloud
,
could
act
a
little
,
could
talk
or
hold
her
tongue
;
and
let
her
host
be
who
they
would
and
as
mighty
as
you
please
,
never
cause
them
trouble
by
seem
to
be
out
of
their
circle
,
and
on
that
account
require
peculiar
attention
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
be
the
guest
of
old
Lady
Pierrepoint
,
in
dumfrie
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
special
to
recommend
Lady
Pierrepoint
except
that
she
have
a
large
house
and
a
good
income
,
and
that
she
like
to
have
people
with
her
of
whom
everybody
know
something
.
<EOS>
so
far
be
Lady
Pierrepoint
from
be
high
in
the
Hittaway
world
,
that
Mrs.
Hittaway
feel
herself
call
upon
to
explain
to
her
friend
that
she
be
force
to
go
to
Dumdum
House
by
the
duty
of
old
friendship
.
<EOS>
dear
old
Lady
Pierrepoint
have
be
insist
on
it
for
the
last
ten
year
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
this
advantage
,
that
Dumfriesshire
be
next
to
Ayrshire
,
that
Dumdum
be
not
very
far
,
 
some
twenty
or
thirty
mile
,
 
from
Portray
,
and
that
she
may
learn
something
about
Lizzie
Eustace
in
her
country
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
the
end
of
August
when
the
Hittaways
leave
London
to
stay
an
entire
month
with
Lady
Pierrepoint
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hittaway
have
very
frequently
explain
his
defalcation
as
to
fashion
,
 
in
that
he
be
remain
in
London
for
three
week
after
Parliament
have
break
up
,
 
by
the
peculiar
exigency
of
the
Board
of
Appeals
in
that
year
.
<EOS>
to
one
or
two
very
intimate
friend
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
hint
that
everything
must
be
make
to
give
way
to
this
horrid
business
of
Fawn
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
whatever
happen
,
and
at
whatever
cost
,
that
must
be
stop
,
"
she
have
venture
to
say
to
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
,
 
who
,
however
,
could
hardly
be
call
one
of
her
very
intimate
friend
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
it
at
all
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
Lady
Eustace
be
very
nice
.
<EOS>
and
why
should
not
she
marry
Lord
Fawn
if
she
be
engage
to
him
?
"
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
hear
of
the
necklace
,
Lady
Glencora
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
have
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
anybody
would
come
to
me
and
try
and
get
my
diamond
!
<EOS>
They
should
hear
what
I
would
say
.
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Hittaway
greatly
admire
Lady
Glencora
,
but
not
the
less
be
she
determine
to
persevere
.
  
<EOS>
have
Lord
Fawn
be
altogether
candid
and
open
with
his
family
at
this
time
,
some
trouble
may
have
be
save
;
for
he
have
almost
altogether
resolve
that
,
let
the
consequence
be
what
they
may
,
he
would
not
marry
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
afraid
to
say
this
even
to
his
own
sister
.
<EOS>
He
have
promise
to
marry
the
woman
,
and
he
must
walk
very
warily
,
or
the
objurgation
of
the
world
would
be
too
many
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
depend
altogether
on
her
conduct
,
Clara
,
"
he
have
say
when
last
his
sister
have
persecute
him
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
,
however
,
sorry
to
have
an
opportunity
of
learn
something
of
the
lady
's
doing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hittaway
have
more
than
once
call
on
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
Mr.
Camperdown
have
say
in
answer
to
a
question
from
Lord
Fawn
's
brother
-
in
-
law
;
"
she
would
play
old
gooseberry
with
the
property
if
we
have
not
some
one
to
look
after
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
fellow
name
Gowran
who
have
live
there
all
his
life
,
and
we
depend
very
much
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
true
,
that
as
to
many
point
of
conduct
,
woman
be
less
nice
than
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hittaway
would
not
probably
have
condescend
himself
to
employ
espionage
,
but
Mrs.
Hittaway
be
less
scrupulous
.
<EOS>
She
actually
go
down
to
Troon
and
have
an
interview
with
Mr.
Gowran
,
use
freely
the
name
of
Mr.
Camperdown
and
of
Lord
Fawn
;
and
some
ten
day
afterwards
Mr.
Gowran
travel
as
far
as
dumfrie
,
and
Dumdum
,
and
have
an
interview
with
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
the
result
of
all
this
,
and
of
further
inquiry
,
will
be
show
by
the
following
letter
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
to
her
sister
Amelia
:
    
Dumdum
,
9th
September
,
18
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
amelia
,
  
<EOS>
here
we
be
,
and
here
we
have
to
remain
to
the
end
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
suit
,
and
all
that
;
but
it
be
awfully
dull
.
<EOS>
Richmond
for
this
time
of
the
year
be
a
paradise
to
it
;
and
as
for
come
to
Scotland
every
autumn
,
I
be
sick
of
it
.
<EOS>
only
what
be
one
to
do
if
one
live
in
London
?
<EOS>
if
it
be
not
for
Orlando
and
the
child
,
I
would
brazen
it
out
,
and
let
people
say
what
they
please
.
<EOS>
as
for
health
,
I
be
never
so
well
as
at
home
,
and
I
do
like
have
my
own
thing
about
me
.
<EOS>
Orlando
have
literally
nothing
to
do
here
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
shooting
,
except
pheasant
,
and
that
do
not
begin
till
October
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
very
glad
I
have
come
as
to
Frederic
,
and
the
more
so
,
as
I
have
learn
the
truth
as
to
that
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
She
,
Lady
Eustace
,
be
a
bad
creature
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
She
still
pretend
that
she
be
engage
to
Frederic
,
and
tell
everybody
that
the
marriage
be
not
break
off
,
and
yet
she
have
her
cousin
with
her
,
make
love
to
him
in
the
most
indecent
way
.
<EOS>
People
use
to
say
in
her
favour
that
at
any
rate
she
never
flirt
.
<EOS>
I
never
quite
know
what
people
mean
when
they
talk
of
flirting
.
<EOS>
but
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
that
she
allow
her
cousin
to
embrace
her
,
and
_
embrace
him
_
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
say
it
if
I
could
not
prove
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
horrible
to
think
of
it
,
when
one
remember
that
she
be
almost
justified
in
say
that
Frederic
be
engage
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
be
engage
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
misfortune
,
but
,
thank
God
,
be
not
yet
past
remedy
.
<EOS>
He
have
some
foolish
feeling
of
what
he
call
honour
;
as
if
a
man
can
be
bind
in
honour
to
marry
a
woman
who
have
deceive
him
in
every
point
!
<EOS>
She
still
stick
to
the
diamond
,
 
if
she
have
not
sell
them
,
as
I
believe
she
have
;
and
Mr.
Camperdown
be
go
to
bring
an
action
against
her
in
the
High
Court
of
Chancery
.
<EOS>
but
still
Frederic
will
not
absolutely
declare
the
thing
off
.
<EOS>
I
feel
,
therefore
,
that
it
be
my
duty
to
let
him
know
what
I
have
learn
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
the
last
to
stir
in
such
a
matter
unless
I
be
sure
I
could
prove
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
quite
like
to
write
to
Frederic
.
<EOS>
Will
mamma
see
him
,
and
tell
him
what
I
say
?
<EOS>
of
course
you
will
show
this
letter
to
mamma
.
<EOS>
if
not
,
I
must
postpone
it
till
I
be
in
town
;
 
but
I
think
it
would
come
better
from
mamma
.
<EOS>
Mamma
may
be
sure
that
she
be
a
bad
woman
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
what
do
you
think
of
your
Mr.
Greystock
?
<EOS>
as
sure
as
I
be
here
he
be
see
with
his
arm
<EOS>
round
his
cousin
's
waist
,
sit
out
of
door
,
 
_
kiss
her
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
be
never
take
in
by
that
story
of
his
marry
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
marry
a
governess
.
<EOS>
He
be
over
head
and
ear
in
debt
,
and
if
he
marry
at
all
,
he
must
marry
some
one
with
money
.
<EOS>
I
really
think
that
mamma
,
and
you
,
and
all
of
you
have
be
soft
about
that
girl
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
have
be
a
good
governess
,
 
that
is
,
good
after
mamma
's
easy
fashion
;
and
I
do
not
for
a
moment
suppose
that
she
be
do
anything
underhand
.
<EOS>
but
a
governess
with
a
lover
never
do
suit
,
and
I
be
sure
it
will
not
suit
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
you
I
would
tell
her
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
the
good
charity
.
<EOS>
whether
they
mean
to
marry
I
can
not
tell
,
 
Mr.
Greystock
,
that
is
,
and
this
woman
;
_
<EOS>
but
they
ought
to
mean
it
_
;
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
know
at
once
whether
mamma
will
see
Frederic
,
and
speak
to
him
openly
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
at
liberty
to
use
my
name
;
only
nobody
but
mamma
should
see
this
letter
.
  
<EOS>
love
to
them
all
,
Your
most
affectionate
sister
,
  
CLARA
HITTAWAY
.
  
<EOS>
in
write
to
Amelia
instead
of
to
her
mother
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
be
sure
that
she
be
communicate
her
idea
to
at
least
two
person
at
Fawn
Court
,
and
that
therefore
there
would
be
discussion
.
<EOS>
have
she
write
to
her
mother
,
her
mother
may
probably
have
hold
her
peace
,
and
do
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
true
"
 
Mrs.
Greystock
,
in
make
her
proposition
respect
Lady
Linlithgow
,
write
to
Lady
Fawn
,
and
by
the
same
post
Frank
write
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
but
before
those
letter
reach
Fawn
Court
there
have
come
that
other
dreadful
letter
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
the
consternation
cause
at
Fawn
Court
in
respect
to
Mr.
Greystock
's
treachery
almost
rob
of
its
importance
the
suggestion
make
as
to
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
this
man
,
who
have
so
openly
and
in
so
manly
a
manner
engage
himself
to
Lucy
Morris
,
should
now
be
propose
to
himself
a
marriage
with
his
rich
cousin
?
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
do
not
believe
that
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
Clara
have
not
see
those
horrid
thing
with
her
own
eye
,
and
other
people
may
be
liar
.
<EOS>
but
Amelia
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
Amelia
evidently
believe
that
all
manner
of
iniquity
be
possible
to
man
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
mamma
,
the
sacrifice
he
be
make
be
so
very
great
!
"
<EOS>
"
but
he
make
it
!
"
plead
Lady
Fawn
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
mamma
,
he
say
he
would
make
it
.
<EOS>
man
do
these
thing
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
horrid
,
but
I
think
they
do
them
more
now
than
they
use
to
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
nobody
care
now
what
he
do
,
if
he
be
not
to
be
put
into
prison
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
resolve
between
these
two
wise
one
that
nothing
at
the
present
should
be
say
to
Lucy
or
to
any
one
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
They
would
wait
awhile
,
and
in
the
meantime
they
attempt
,
 
as
far
as
it
be
possible
to
make
the
attempt
without
express
word
,
 
to
let
Lucy
understand
that
she
may
remain
at
Fawn
Court
if
she
please
.
<EOS>
while
this
be
go
on
,
Lord
Fawn
do
come
down
once
again
,
and
on
that
occasion
Lucy
simply
absent
herself
from
the
dinner
-
table
and
from
the
family
circle
for
that
evening
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
come
in
,
and
you
have
get
to
go
to
prison
again
,
"
Nina
say
to
her
,
with
a
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
the
matter
to
which
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
letter
more
specially
allude
be
debate
between
the
mother
and
daughter
at
great
length
.
<EOS>
They
,
indeed
,
be
less
brave
and
less
energetic
than
be
the
married
daughter
of
the
family
;
but
as
they
see
Lord
Fawn
more
frequently
,
they
know
better
than
Mrs.
Hittaway
the
real
state
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
They
feel
sure
that
he
be
already
sufficiently
embitter
against
Lady
Eustace
,
and
think
that
therefore
the
peculiarly
unpleasant
task
assign
to
Lady
Fawn
nee
not
be
perform
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
not
the
advantage
of
live
so
much
in
the
world
as
her
daughter
,
and
be
oppress
by
,
perhaps
,
a
squeamish
delicacy
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
could
not
tell
him
about
her
sitting
and
 
and
kiss
the
man
.
<EOS>
Could
I
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
,
"
say
Amelia
;
 
"
but
Clara
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
to
tell
the
truth
,
"
continue
Lady
Fawn
,
"
I
should
not
care
a
bit
about
it
if
it
be
not
for
poor
Lucy
.
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
her
if
that
man
be
untrue
to
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
on
earth
would
make
her
believe
it
,
unless
it
come
from
himself
,
"
say
Amelia
,
 
who
really
do
know
something
of
Lucy
's
character
.
<EOS>
"
till
he
tell
her
,
or
till
she
know
that
he
be
married
,
she
will
never
believe
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
,
after
a
few
day
,
there
come
those
other
letter
from
Bobsborough
,
 
one
from
the
dean
's
wife
and
the
other
from
Frank
.
<EOS>
the
matter
there
propose
it
be
necessary
that
they
should
discuss
with
Lucy
,
as
the
suggestion
have
reach
Lucy
as
well
as
themselves
.
<EOS>
She
at
once
come
to
Lady
Fawn
with
her
lover
's
letter
,
and
with
a
gentle
merry
<EOS>
laugh
face
declare
that
the
thing
would
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
should
get
on
with
her
,
and
I
should
know
that
it
would
not
be
for
long
,
"
say
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
we
do
not
want
you
to
go
at
all
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
I
must
,
"
say
Lucy
in
her
sharp
,
decide
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
I
be
bind
to
wait
till
I
hear
from
Mr.
Greystock
,
because
it
be
my
first
duty
to
obey
him
.
<EOS>
but
of
course
I
can
not
stay
here
after
what
have
pass
.
<EOS>
as
Nina
say
,
it
be
simply
go
to
prison
when
Lord
Fawn
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nina
be
an
impertinent
little
chit
,
"
say
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
the
dear
little
friend
in
all
the
world
,
"
say
Lucy
,
"
and
always
tell
the
exact
truth
.
<EOS>
I
do
go
to
prison
,
and
when
he
come
I
feel
that
I
ought
to
go
to
prison
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
must
go
away
.
<EOS>
what
do
it
matter
?
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
will
not
be
exactly
like
you
,
"
 
and
she
put
her
little
hand
upon
Lady
Fawn
's
fat
arm
caressingly
,
"
and
I
sha'n't
have
you
all
to
spoil
me
;
but
I
shall
be
simply
wait
till
he
come
.
<EOS>
everything
now
must
be
no
more
than
wait
till
he
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
if
it
be
to
be
that
"
he
"
would
never
come
,
this
be
very
dreadful
.
<EOS>
Amelia
clearly
think
that
"
he
"
would
never
come
,
and
Lady
Fawn
be
apt
to
think
her
daughter
wise
than
herself
.
<EOS>
and
if
Mr.
Greystock
be
such
as
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
describe
him
to
be
,
 
if
there
be
to
be
no
such
come
as
that
for
which
Lucy
fondly
wait
,
 
then
there
would
be
reason
ten
-
fold
strong
why
she
should
not
leave
Fawn
Court
and
go
to
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
in
such
case
,
 
when
that
blow
should
fall
,
 
Lucy
would
require
very
different
treatment
than
may
be
expect
for
her
from
the
hand
of
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
She
would
fade
and
fall
to
the
earth
like
a
flower
with
an
insect
at
its
root
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
like
a
wound
branch
,
into
which
no
sap
would
run
.
<EOS>
with
such
misfortune
and
wretchedness
possibly
before
her
,
Lady
Fawn
could
not
endure
the
idea
that
Lucy
should
be
turn
out
to
encounter
it
all
beneath
the
cold
shade
of
Lady
Linlithgow
's
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
she
say
,
"
let
bygone
be
bygone
.
<EOS>
come
down
and
meet
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
nobody
will
say
anything
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
you
be
provoke
very
much
,
and
there
have
be
quite
enough
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
,
from
Lady
Fawn
,
be
almost
miraculous
,
 
from
Lady
Fawn
,
to
whom
her
son
have
ever
be
the
high
of
human
being
!
<EOS>
but
Lucy
have
tell
the
tale
to
her
lover
,
and
her
lover
approve
of
her
go
.
<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
act
upon
her
mind
some
feeling
,
of
which
she
be
hardly
conscious
,
that
as
long
as
she
remain
at
Fawn
Court
she
would
not
see
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
him
that
she
could
make
herself
supremely
happy
in
the
simple
knowledge
that
he
love
her
.
<EOS>
but
we
all
know
how
far
such
declaration
should
be
take
as
true
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
she
be
long
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
would
only
pass
by
the
road
,
"
she
would
say
to
herself
,
"
so
that
I
may
peep
at
him
through
the
gate
!
"
<EOS>
She
have
no
form
idea
in
her
own
mind
that
she
would
be
able
to
see
him
<EOS>
should
she
go
to
Lady
Linlithgow
,
but
still
there
would
be
the
chance
of
her
altered
life
!
<EOS>
She
would
tell
Lady
Linlithgow
the
truth
,
and
why
should
Lady
Linlithgow
refuse
her
so
rational
a
pleasure
?
<EOS>
there
be
,
of
course
,
a
reason
why
Frank
should
not
come
to
Fawn
Court
;
but
the
house
in
Bruton
Street
nee
not
be
close
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
how
to
love
you
enough
,
"
she
say
to
Lady
Fawn
,
"
but
indeed
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
I
do
<EOS>
so
hope
the
time
may
come
when
you
and
Mr.
Greystock
may
be
friend
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
it
will
come
.
<EOS>
Shall
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
can
look
into
the
future
?
"
say
the
wise
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
if
he
be
your
husband
,
we
shall
love
him
,
"
say
the
less
wise
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
to
be
my
husband
,
"
say
Lucy
,
spring
up
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
do
you
mean
anything
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
who
be
not
at
all
wise
,
protest
that
she
mean
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
they
to
do
?
<EOS>
on
that
special
day
they
merely
stipulate
that
there
should
be
a
day
's
delay
before
Lady
Fawn
answer
Mrs.
Greystock
's
letter
,
 
so
that
she
may
sleep
upon
it
.
<EOS>
the
sleeping
on
it
mean
that
further
discussion
which
be
to
take
place
between
Lady
Fawn
and
her
second
daughter
in
her
ladyship
's
bed
-
room
that
night
.
<EOS>
during
all
this
period
the
general
discomfort
of
Fawn
Court
be
increase
by
a
certain
sullenness
on
the
part
of
Augusta
,
the
elder
daughter
,
who
know
that
letter
have
come
and
that
consultation
be
be
hold
,
 
but
who
be
not
admit
to
those
consultation
.
<EOS>
since
the
day
on
which
poor
Augusta
have
be
hand
over
to
Lizzie
Eustace
as
her
peculiar
friend
in
the
family
,
there
have
always
exist
a
feeling
that
she
,
by
her
position
,
be
debar
from
sympathise
in
the
general
desire
to
be
quit
of
Lizzie
;
and
then
,
too
,
poor
Augusta
be
never
thoroughly
trust
by
that
great
guide
of
the
family
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
keep
it
to
herself
if
you
would
give
her
gold
to
do
it
,
"
Mrs.
Hittaway
would
say
.
<EOS>
consequently
Augusta
be
sullen
and
conscious
of
ill
-
usage
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
fix
upon
anything
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
to
Lucy
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
quite
;
 
<EOS>
only
I
be
to
go

I
do
not
see
why
you
should
go
away
at
all

Frederic
do
not
come
here
so
very
often
,
and
when
he
do
come
he
do
not
say
much
to
any
one

I
suppose
it
be
all
Amelia
's
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
want
me
to
go

only
I
feel
that
I

Mr.

think
it
good

go
to

no

dear

<EOS>
I
do
not
think

want
to
quarrel
with
any

above
all
he
must
not
quarrel
with
me
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
quarrel
with
him
,

that
be
a
misfortune
,
 
just
for
the
present
.

<EOS>
"
and
where
be
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
have
be
settle
yet
;
but
we
be
talk
of
Lady
Linlithgow
,
 
if
she
will
take
me
.

"
Lady
Linlithgow

oh
dear
!

"
  
<EOS>
"
will
not
it
do

"
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
she
be
the
most
dreadful
old
woman
in
London

<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
tell
such
story
about
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
I
think
I
shall
rather
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
thing
be
very
different
with
Lucy
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
that
discussion
in
Lady
Fawn
's
room
be
protract
till
midnight
,
and
then
it
be
decide
that
just
a
word
should
be
say
to
Lucy
,
so
that
,
if
possible
,
she
may
be
induce
to
remain
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
be
to
say
the
word
,
and
on
the
follow
morning
she
be
closet
with
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
she
begin
,
"
we
all
want
you
to
do
us
a
particular
favour
.
"
<EOS>
as
she
say
this
,
she
hold
Lucy
by
the
hand
,
and
no
one
look
at
them
would
have
think
that
Lucy
be
a
governess
and
that
Lady
Fawn
be
her
employer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lady
Fawn
,
indeed
it
be
well
that
I
should
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
stay
just
one
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
do
that
,
because
then
this
chance
of
a
home
would
be
go
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
we
can
not
wait
a
month
before
we
let
Mrs.
Greystock
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
write
to
her
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
,
you
see
,
Mr.
Greystock
wish
it
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
know
that
Lucy
could
be
very
firm
,
and
have
hardly
hope
that
anything
could
be
do
by
simple
persuasion
.
<EOS>
They
have
long
be
accustomed
among
themselves
to
call
her
obstinate
,
and
know
that
even
in
her
act
of
obedience
she
have
a
way
of
obeying
after
her
own
fashion
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
well
,
therefore
,
that
the
thing
to
be
say
should
be
say
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lucy
,
have
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
there
may
be
a
slip
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
,
Lady
Fawn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
sometimes
engagement
take
place
which
never
become
more
than
engagement

look
at
Lord

Lady
Eustace
.

<EOS>
"
Mr.

I
be
not
like
that

Lucy

proudly

<EOS>

such
thing
be
very
dreadful
,
Lucy

they
do
happen

do
you
mean
anything

anything
real

Lady

<EOS>
"
I
have
so
strong
a
reliance
on
your
good
sense

that
I
will
tell
you
just
what
I
do
mean

<EOS>
a
rumour
have
reach
me
that
Mr.

be
 
pay
more
attention
than
he
ought
to
do
to
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
own
cousin

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
people
marry
their
cousin
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
whom
he
have
always
be
just
like
a
brother
!
<EOS>
I
do
think
that
be
the
cruell
thing
.
<EOS>
because
he
sacrifice
his
time
and
his
money
and
all
his
holiday
to
go
and
look
after
her
affair
,
this
be
to
be
say
of
him
!
<EOS>
She
have
not
another
human
being
to
look
after
her
,
and
,
therefore
,
he
be
oblige
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
have
tell
me
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
think
,
Lady
Fawn

<EOS>
I
do
think
that
be
the
great
shame
I
ever

if
it
should
be
true

just
for

It

not

surely
I
may
speak

abrupt
with
me

you
listen

will
listen

nothing

well

where

You

more
settled

even
if
it

only
a
rumour

I
be
sure
I
do
not

be
anything
more

you
have
better
hear
about
it
with
us

with
friend
round
you

than
with
a
perfect
stranger
like
Lady
Linlithgow

anything
be
to
go
wrong
there

you
would
not

where
to
go

be
wrong
with
you
here

you

I
love
you

better
than
all
the
world
 
except
Mr.
Greystock

<EOS>
if
anything
like
that
be
to
happen
,
I
think
I
should
creep
here
and
ask
to
die
in
your
house
.

it
will
not
.
<EOS>
and
just
now
it
will
be
well
that
I
should
go
away

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
find
at
last
that
Lucy
must
have
her
way
,
and
letter
be
write
both
to
Mrs.
Greystock
and
to
Frank
,
request
that
the
suggest
overture
may
at
once
be
make
to
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
in
her
letter
to
her
lover
,
be
more
than
ordinarily
cheerful
and
jocose
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
good
deal
to
say
about
Lady
Linlithgow
that
be
really
droll
,
and
not
a
word
to
say
indicative
of
the
slight
fear
in
the
direction
of
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
speak
of
poor
Lizzie
,
and
declare
her
conviction
that
that
marriage
never
could
come
off
now
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
be
angry
when
I
say
that
I
can
not
break
my
heart
for
them

I
never
do
think
that
they
be
very
much
in
love

as
for
Lord
Fawn

of
course
he
be
my
 
enemy

<EOS>
and
she
write
the
word
in
big
letter

"
<EOS>
and
as
for
Lizzie
,
 
she
be
your
cousin
,
and
all
that

she
be
ever
so
pretty
,

all
that

and
she
be
as
rich
as
Croesus

all
that

I
do
not

she
will
break
her
own
heart

I
would
break
mine
;
only
 
only
 
only
 
You
will
understand
the
rest
.
<EOS>
if
it
should
come
to
pass
,
I
wonder
whether
"
the
duchess
"
would
ever
let
a
poor
creature
see
a
friend
of
her
in
Bruton
Street
?
"
<EOS>
Frank
have
once
call
Lady
Linlithgow
the
duchess
,
after
a
certain
popular
picture
in
a
certain
popular
book
,
and
Lucy
never
forget
anything
that
Frank
have
say
.
  
<EOS>
It
do
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greystock
at
once
correspond
with
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
Lady
Linlithgow
,
who
be
at
Ramsgate
for
her
autumn
vacation
,
request
that
Lucy
Morris
may
be
bring
to
see
her
at
her
house
in
London
on
the
2nd
of
October
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
's
autumn
holiday
always
end
on
the
last
day
of
September
.
<EOS>
on
the
2nd
of
October
Lady
Fawn
herself
take
Lucy
up
to
Bruton
Street
,
and
Lady
Linlithgow
appear
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Morris
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
,
"
think
it
right
that
you
should
be
tell
that
she
be
engage
to
be
marry
.
"
<EOS>
"
who
to
?
<EOS>
"
demand
the
countess
.
<EOS>
Lucy
be
as
red
as
fire
,
although
she
have
especially
make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
blush
when
the
communication
be
make
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
she
wish
me
to
mention
the
gentleman
's
name
,
just
at
present
;
but
I
can
assure
you
that
he
be
all
that
he
ought
to
be
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hate
mystery
,
"
say
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
Lady
Linlithgow
 
"
begin
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
nothing
to
me
,
"
continue
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
come
off
for
six
month
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
Lucy
give
a
mute
assurance
that
there
would
be
no
such
difficulty
as
that
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
can
not
come
here
,
Miss
Morris
.
<EOS>
"
to
this
Lucy
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
may
win
over
even
the
countess
,
and
if
not
,
she
must
bear
her
six
month
of
prolong
exclusion
from
the
light
of
day
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
matter
be
settle
.
<EOS>
Lucy
be
to
be
take
back
to
Richmond
,
and
to
come
again
on
the
follow
Monday
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
this
parting
at
all
,
Lucy

Lady
Fawn
say
on
her
way
home

<EOS>
"
It
be
well
so
,
Lady
Fawn
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
people
go
away
;
but
,
somehow
,
you
do
not
feel
it
as
we
do

<EOS>

You
would
not

that

what
be
Nina
to
do
now

I
can
not
get
another
governess
after
you

hate
all
these
sudden
break
up

and
all
for
such
a
trumpery
thing

Frederic
have
not

all
about
it

have
not
come
altogether
from

<EOS>

how
have
it
come
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
because
of
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
when
a
girl
have
engage
herself
to
marry
a
man
she
must
think
more
of
him
than
of
anything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
could
not
you
think
of
him
at
Fawn
Court
?

because
 
because
thing
have
be
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
your
friend
,
 
not
as
yet
.
<EOS>
can
not
you
understand
,
Lady
Fawn
,
that
,
dear
as
you
all
must
be
to
me
,
I
must
live
in
his
friendship
,
and
take
his
part
when
there
be
a
part
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
suppose
that
you
mean
to
hate
all
of
us
?
"
<EOS>
Lucy
could
only
cry
at
hear
this
;
 
whereupon
Lady
Fawn
also
burst
into
tear
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Sunday
before
Lucy
take
her
departure
,
Lord
Fawn
be
again
at
Richmond
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
you
will
come
down
,
 
just
as
if
nothing
have
happen
,

say
Lydia
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
see

Lucy

<EOS>
"
Mamma
will
be
very
angry
if
you
do
not
,

say
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
but
Lucy
have
a
little
plot
in
her
head
,
and
her
appearance
at
the
dinner
-
table
on
that
Sunday
must
depend
on
the
manner
in
which
her
plot
be
execute
.
<EOS>
after
church
,
Lord
Fawn
would
always
hang
about
the
ground
for
awhile
before
go
into
the
house
;
and
on
this
morning
Lucy
also
remain
outside
.
<EOS>
She
soon
find
her
opportunity
,
and
walk
straight
up
to
him
,
follow
him
on
the
path
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
have
come
to
beg
your
pardon

He
have
turn
round
hearing
footstep
behind
him
,
but
still
be
startled
and
unready
.
<EOS>
"
It
do
not
matter
at
all

he
say

<EOS>
"
It

to
me

I
behave
badly

do
not

of
that
now

beg
your
pardon

I
say
what
I
ought

You
see

have
say
it

Juniper

now
Juniper
be
the
gardener
,
and
Lord
Fawn
do
not
quite
like
the
way
in
which
the
thing
be
put
to
him

the
cloud
come
across
his
brow

he
begin
to
fear

again
insult
him

in

<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
at
Home
 
Lucy
,
in
her
letter
to
her
lover
,
have
distinctly
ask
whether
she
may
tell
Lady
Linlithgow
the
name
of
her
future
husband
,
but
have
receive
no
reply
when
she
be
take
to
Bruton
Street
.
<EOS>
the
parting
at
Richmond
be
very
painful
,
and
Lady
Fawn
have
declare
herself
quite
unable
to
make
another
journey
up
to
London
with
the
ungrateful
runagate
.
<EOS>
though
there
be
no
diminution
of
affection
among
the
Fawns
,
there
be
a
general
feeling
that
Lucy
be
behave
badly
.
<EOS>
that
obstinacy
of
her
be
get
the
well
of
her
.
<EOS>
why
should
she
have
go
?
<EOS>
even
Lord
Fawn
have
express
his
desire
that
she
should
remain
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
in
the
breast
of
the
wise
one
,
all
faith
in
the
Greystock
engagement
have
nearly
vanish
.
<EOS>
another
letter
have
come
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
who
now
declare
that
it
be
already
understand
about
Portray
that
Lady
Eustace
intend
to
marry
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
this
be
describe
as
a
terrible
crime
on
the
part
of
Lizzie
,
though
the
antagonistic
crime
of
a
remain
desire
to
marry
Lord
Fawn
be
still
imputed
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
,
of
course
,
the
one
crime
heighten
the
other
.
<EOS>
so
that
word
from
the
eloquent
pen
of
Mrs.
Hittaway
fail
to
make
dark
enough
the
blackness
of
poor
Lizzie
's
character
.
<EOS>
as
for
Mr.
Greystock
,
he
be
simply
a
heartless
man
of
the
world
,
wish
to
feather
his
nest
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
do
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
he
have
ever
dream
of
marry
Lucy
Morris

<EOS>
man
always
have
three
or
four
little
excitement
of
that
kind
go
on
for
the
amusement
of
their
leisure
hour
,
 
so
,
at

,
say
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
"
the

better

be
her

there

the

<EOS>
She

deanery
,
after
a
residence
of
six
month
with
Lady
Linlithgow

<EOS>
at
the
deanery
of
course
she
would
see
Frank
;
and
she
also
understand
that
a
long
visit
to
the
deanery
would
be
the
sure
prelude
to
that
home
of
her
own
of
which
she
be
always
dream

you

from
your

<EOS>

I
have
not
see
Mrs.

long

then
Lady
Fawn
have
tell
you
,

somebody
.
<EOS>
when
the
wind
be
east
,

north
-
east
,

even
north

I

cross

for
I
have
the
lumbago
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very

You
can

humour
with
the
lumbago

and
I
have
the
gout
sometimes
in
my
knee

<EOS>
I
be
cross
enough
then
,

so
you
would
be

,
among

all

I
do
not
get
much
above
half
what
I
ought
to
have
out
of
my

that
make
me
very
cross

<EOS>
My
tooth
be
bad

I
like
to
have
the
meat
tender

but
it
be
always
tough

and
that
make
me
cross

<EOS>
and
when
people
go
against
the
grain
with
me
,
as
Lizzie
Eustace
always
do
,
then
I
be
very
cross

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
not

bad
with

<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
say
the
old
woman
,
and
then
she
go
back
to
her
account
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
have
a
few
book
of
her
own
,
and
she
determine
to
ask
Frank
to
send
her
some
.
<EOS>
book
be
cheap
thing
,
and
she
would
not
mind
ask
him
for
magazine
,
and
number
,
and
perhaps
for
the
loan
of
a
few
volume
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
she
do
read
Tupper
's
poem
,
and
"
Pride
and
Prejudice
,
"
and
one
of
Miss
Edgeworth
's
novel
,
 
probably
for
the
third
time
.
<EOS>
during
the
first
week
in
Bruton
Street
she
would
have
be
comfortable
enough
,
only
that
she
have
not
receive
a
line
from
Frank
.
<EOS>
that
Frank
be
not
specially
good
at
write
letter
she
have
already
teach
herself
to
understand
.
<EOS>
She
be
incline
to
believe
that
but
few
man
of
business
do
write
letter
willingly
,
and
that
,
of
all
man
,
lawyer
be
the
least
willing
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
how
reasonable
it
be
that
a
man
who
have
to
perform
a
great
part
of
his
daily
work
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
,
should
loathe
a
pen
when
not
at
work
.
<EOS>
to
her
the
writing
of
letter
be
perhaps
the
most
delightful
occupation
of
her
life
,
and
the
writing
of
letter
to
her
lover
be
a
foretaste
of
heaven
;
but
then
man
,
as
she
know
,
be
very
different
from
woman
.
<EOS>
and
she
know
this
also
,
 
that
of
all
her
immediate
duty
,
no
duty
could
be
clear
than
that
of
abstain
from
all
jealousy
,
petulance
,
and
impatient
expectation
of
little
attention
.
<EOS>
He
love
her
,
and
have
tell
her
so
,
and
have
promise
her
that
she
should
be
his
wife
,
and
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
long
for
a
letter
,
because
she
be
very
anxious
to
know
whether
she
may
mention
his
name
to
Lady
Linlithgow
;
 
but
she
would
abstain
from
any
idea
of
blame
him
because
the
letter
do
not
come
.
  
<EOS>
on
various
occasion
the
countess
show
some
little
curiosity
about
the
lover

at
last
,
after
about
ten
day
,
when
she
find
herself
begin
to
be
intimate
with
her
new
companion

she
put
the
question

blank

a

She
turn
round
in

chair

sit
for
awhile
silent

at

to
this

keep

out

that

<EOS>
neither
on

on
the
two
follow
day
do
Lady
Linlithgow
say
a
word
further
to
Lucy
about
her
engagement
.
   
<EOS>
too
Bad
for
Sympathy
 
<EOS>
when
Frank
Greystock
leave
Bobsborough
to
go
to
Scotland
,
he
have
not
say
that
he
would
return
,
nor
have
he
at
that
time
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
would
do
so
or
no
.
<EOS>
He
have
promise
to
go
and
shoot
in
Norfolk
,
and
have
half
undertake
to
be
up
in
London
with
Herriot
,
work
.
<EOS>
though
it
be
holiday
-
time
,
still
there
be
plenty
of
work
for
him
to
do
,
 
various
heavy
case
to
get
up
,
and
paper
to
be
read
,
if
only
he
could
settle
himself
down
to
the
doing
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
scene
down
in
Scotland
have
be
of
a
nature
to
make
him
unfit
for
steady
labour
.
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
sail
his
bark
through
the
rock
by
which
his
present
voyage
be
render
so
dangerous
?
<EOS>
of
course
,
to
the
reader
,
the
way
to
do
so
seem
to
be
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
to
work
hard
at
his
profession
;
to
explain
to
his
cousin
that
she
have
altogether
mistake
his
feeling
;
and
to
be
true
to
Lucy
Morris
<EOS>
be
so
manifestly
his
duty
<EOS>
,
that
to
no
reader
will
it
appear
possible
that
to
any
gentleman
there
could
be
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
instead
of
the
existence
of
a
difficulty
,
there
be
a
flood
of
light
upon
his
path
,
 
<EOS>
so
the
reader
will
think
;
 
<EOS>
a
flood
so
clear
that
not
to
see
<EOS>
his
way
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
a
man
carry
away
by
abnormal
appetite
,
and
wickedness
,
and
the
devil
,
may
of
course
commit
murder
,
or
forge
bill
,
or
become
a
fraudulent
director
of
a
bankrupt
company
.
<EOS>
and
so
may
a
man
be
untrue
to
his
troth
,
 
and
leave
true
love
in
pursuit
of
tinsel
,
and
beauty
,
and
false
word
,
and
a
large
income
.
<EOS>
but
why
should
one
tell
the
story
of
creature
<EOS>
so
base
?
<EOS>
one
do
not
willingly
grovel
in
gutter
,
or
breathe
fetid
atmosphere
,
or
live
upon
garbage
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
to
deal
with
hero
and
heroine
,
let
us
,
at
any
rate
,
have
hero
and
heroine
who
be
above
such
meanness
as
falsehood
in
love
.
<EOS>
this
Frank
Greystock
must
be
little
well
than
a
mean
villain
,
if
he
allow
himself
to
be
turn
from
his
allegiance
to
Lucy
Morris
for
an
hour
by
the
seduction
and
money
of
such
a
one
as
Lizzie
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
We
know
the
dear
old
rhyme
:
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
good
to
be
merry
and
wise
,
It
be
good
to
be
honest
and
true
,
It
be
good
to
be
off
with
the
old
love
before
you
be
on
with
the
new
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
never
well
truth
speak
than
this
,
and
if
all
man
and
woman
could
follow
the
advice
here
give
,
there
would
be
very
little
sorrow
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
man
and
woman
do
not
follow
it
.
<EOS>
They
be
no
more
able
to
do
so
than
they
be
to
use
a
spear
,
the
staff
of
which
be
like
a
weaver
's
beam
,
or
to
fight
with
the
sword
Excalibur
.
<EOS>
the
more
they
exercise
their
arm
,
the
nearer
will
they
get
to
use
the
giant
's
weapon
,
 
or
even
the
weapon
that
be
divine
.
<EOS>
but
as
thing
be
at
present
,
their
limb
be
limp
and
their
muscle
soft
,
and
over
-
feeding
impede
their
breath
.
<EOS>
They
attempt
to
be
merry
without
be
wise
,
and
have
theory
about
truth
and
honesty
with
which
they
desire
to
shackle
other
,
think
that
freedom
from
such
trammel
may
be
good
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
and
in
that
matter
of
love
,
 
though
love
be
very
potent
,
 
treachery
will
sometimes
seem
to
be
prudence
,
and
a
hankering
after
new
delight
will
often
interfere
with
real
devotion
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
easy
to
depict
a
hero
,
 
a
man
absolutely
stainless
,
perfect
as
an
Arthur
,
 
a
man
honest
in
all
his
dealing
,
equal
to
all
trial
,
true
in
all
his
speech
,
indifferent
to
his
own
prosperity
,
struggle
for
the
general
good
,
and
,
above
all
,
faithful
in
love
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
it
be
as
easy
to
do
that
as
to
tell
of
the
man
who
be
one
hour
good
and
the
next
bad
,
who
aspire
greatly
but
fail
in
practice
,
who
see
the
high
but
too
often
follow
the
low
course
.
<EOS>
there
arise
at
one
time
a
school
of
art
,
which
delight
to
paint
the
human
face
as
perfect
in
beauty
;
and
from
that
time
to
this
we
be
discontent
unless
every
woman
be
draw
for
us
as
a
Venus
,
or
,
at
least
,
a
Madonna
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
we
have
gain
much
by
this
untrue
portraiture
,
either
in
beauty
or
in
art
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
make
for
us
a
pretty
thing
to
look
at
,
no
doubt
;
 
but
we
know
that
that
pretty
thing
be
not
really
visage
as
the
mistress
whom
we
serve
,
and
whose
lineament
we
desire
to
perpetuate
on
the
canvas
.
<EOS>
the
wind
of
heaven
,
or
the
flesh
-
pot
of
Egypt
,
or
the
midnight
gas
,
 
passion
,
pain
,
and
,
perhaps
,
rouge
and
powder
,
have
make
her
something
different
.
<EOS>
but
there
still
be
the
fire
of
her
eye
,
and
the
eager
eloquence
of
her
mouth
,
and
something
,
too
,
perhaps
,
leave
of
the
depart
innocence
of
youth
,
which
the
painter
may
give
us
without
the
Venus
or
the
Madonna
touch
.
<EOS>
but
the
painter
do
not
dare
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
paint
so
long
after
the
other
fashion
that
he
would
hate
the
canvas
before
him
,
be
he
to
give
way
to
the
rouge
-
begotten
roughness
or
to
the
flesh
-
pot
,
 
or
even
to
the
wind
.
<EOS>
and
how
,
my
lord
,
would
you
,
who
be
give
hundred
,
more
than
hundred
,
for
this
portrait
of
your
dear
one
,
like
to
see
it
in
print
from
the
art
critic
of
the
day
,
that
she
be
a
brazen

face
hoyden
who
seem
to
have
have
a
glass
of
wine
too
much
,
or
to
have
be
make
hay
?
  
<EOS>
and
so
also
have
the
read
world
teach
itself
to
like
good
the
character
of
all
but
divine
man
and
woman
.
<EOS>
let
the
man
who
paint
with
pen
and
ink
give
the
gas
-
light
,
and
the
flesh
-
pot
,
the
passion

pain
,
the
prurient
prudence
and
the
rouge
-
pot
and
pounce

box
of
the
world
as
it

and
he
will
be
tell
that
no

<EOS>
with

we

<EOS>

be

They

false

<EOS>
They
be
so

and
we

<EOS>
then
we
forgive
them
,
not
without
a
consciousness
of
imperfection
on
our

<EOS>
and
we
know
 
or

at

,
believe

that
though
they
be
sometimes
treacherous
and
false
,
there
be
a

good

<EOS>
We

<EOS>
there

achievement
worthy

<EOS>
the
person
whom
you
can
not
care
for
in
a
novel
,
because
they
be
so
bad
,
be
the
very
same
that
you
so
dearly
love
in
your
life
,
because
they
be
so
good
.
<EOS>
to
make
them
and
ourselves
somewhat
better
,
 
not
by
one
spring
heavenward
to
perfection
,
because
we
can
not
so
use
our
leg
,

by
slow
climbing

be

we
may
presume
,
the
object
of
all
teacher

leader

legislator

spiritual
pastor

and
master

<EOS>
He
who
write
tale
such
as
this
,
probably
also
have
,
very
humbly
,
some
such
object
distantly
before
him
.
<EOS>
a
picture
of
surpass
godlike
nobleness
,
 
a
picture
of
a
King
Arthur
among
man
,
may
perhaps
do
much
.
<EOS>
but
such
picture
can
not
do
all
.
<EOS>
when
such
a
picture
be
paint
,
as
intend
to
show
what
a
man
should
be

it
be
true

<EOS>
if
paint

it

<EOS>
the
true
picture
of

as
it

if
it
could

would
show
man
what
they
be

how
they

not

indeed
,
to
perfection
,
but
one
step
first
,

then
another

on

<EOS>
Our
hero
,
Frank
Greystock
,
fall
lamentably
short
in
his
heroism
,
be
not
in
a
happy
state
of
mind
when
he
reach
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
return
to
his
own
borough
and
to
his
mother
's
arm
because
he
feel
,
that
be
he
to
determine
to
be
false
to
Lucy
,
he
would
there
receive
sympathy
in
his
treachery
.
<EOS>
His
mother
would
,
at
any
rate
,
think
that
it
be
well
,
and
his
father
would
acknowledge
that
the
fault
commit
be
in
the
original
engagement
with
poor
Lucy
,
and
not
in
the
treachery
.
<EOS>
He
have
write
that
letter
to
her
in
his
chamber
one
night
in
a
fit
of
ecstasy
;
and
could
it
be
right
that
the
ruin
of
a
whole
life
should
be
the
consequence
?
  
<EOS>
It
can
hardly
be
too
strongly
assert
that
Lizzie
Greystock
do
not
appear
to
Frank
as
she
have
be
make
to
appear
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
in
all
this
affair
of
the
necklace
he
be
begin
to
believe
that
she
be
really
an
ill
-
use
woman
;
and
as
to
other
trait
in
Lizzie
's
character
,
 
trait
which
he
have
see
,
and
which
be
not
of
a
nature
to
attract
,
 
it
must
be
remember
that
beauty
recline
in
a
man
's
arm
do
go
far
towards
wash
white
the
lovely
blackamoor
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
,
upon
whom
Lizzie
's
beauty
could
have
no
effect
of
that
kind
,
have
nevertheless
declare
her
to
be
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
and
this
loveliness
be
of
a
nature
that
be
altogether
pleasing
,
if
once
the
beholder
of
it
could
get
over
the
idea
of
falseness
which
certainly
Lizzie
's
eye
be
apt
to
convey
to
the
beholder
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
unclean
horse
's
tail
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
get
-
up
of
flounce
,
and
padding
,
and
paint
,
and
hair
,
with
a
dorsal
excrescence
append
with
the
object
surely
of
show
in
triumph
how
much
absurd
ugliness
woman
can
force
man
to
endure
.
<EOS>
She
be
lithe
,
and
active
,
and
bright
,
 
and
be
at
this
moment
of
her
life
at
her
good
.
<EOS>
Her
grow
charm
have
as
yet
hardly
reach
the
limit
of
full
feminine
loveliness
,
 
which
,
when
reach
,
have
be
surpass
.
<EOS>
luxuriant
beauty
have
with
her
not
as
yet
become
comeliness
;
nor
have
age
or
the
good
thing
of
the
world
add
a
pound
to
the
fairy
lightness
of
her
footstep
.
<EOS>
all
this
have
be
tender
to
Frank
,
 
and
with
it
that
worldly
wealth
which
be
so
absolutely
necessary
to
his
career
.
<EOS>
for
though
Greystock
would
not
have
say
to
any
man
or
woman
that
nature
have
intend
him
to
be
a
spender
of
much
money
and
a
consumer
of
many
good
thing
,
he
do
undoubtedly
so
think
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
Greystock
,
and
to
what
misery
would
he
not
reduce
his
Lucy
<EOS>
if
,
burthen
by
such
propensity
,
he
be
to
marry
her
and
then
become
an
aristocratic
pauper
!
  
<EOS>
the
offer
of
herself
by
a
woman
to
a
man
be
,
to
us
all
,
a
thing
so
distasteful
that
we
at
once
declare
that
the
woman
must
be
abominable
.
<EOS>
there
shall
be
no
whitewashing
of
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
be
abominable
.
<EOS>
but
the
man
to
whom
the
offer
be
make
hardly
see
the
thing
in
the
same
light
.
<EOS>
He
be
dispose
to
believe
that
,
in
his
peculiar
case
,
there
be
circumstance
by
which
the
woman
be
,
if
not
justified
,
at
least
excuse
.
<EOS>
Frank
do
put
faith
in
his
cousin
's
love
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
do
credit
her
when
she
tell
him
that
she
have
accept
Lord
Fawn
's
offer
in
pique
,
because
he
have
not
come
to
her
when
he
have
promise
that
he
would
come
.
<EOS>
It
do
seem
natural
to
him
that
she
should
have
desire
to
adhere
to
her
engagement
when
he
would
not
advise
her
to
depart
from
it
.
<EOS>
and
then
her
jealousy
about
Lucy
's
ring
,
and
her
abuse
of
Lucy
,
be
proofs
to
him
of
her
love
.
<EOS>
unless
she
love
him
,
why
should
she
care
to
marry
him
?
<EOS>
what
be
his
position
that
she
should
desire
to
share
it
;
 
unless
she
so
desire
because
he
be
dearer
to
her
than
aught
beside
?
<EOS>
He
have
not
eye
clear
enough
to
perceive
that
his
cousin
be
a
witch
whistle
for
a
wind
,
and
ready
to
take
the
first
blast
that
would
carry
her
and
her
broomstick
somewhere
into
the
sky
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
in
that
matter
of
the
offer
,
which
in
ordinary
circumstance
certainly
should
not
have
come
from
her
to
him
,
do
not
the
fact
of
her
wealth
and
of
his
comparative
poverty
cleanse
her
from
such
stain
as
would
,
in
usual
circumstance
,
attach
to
a
woman
who
be
so
forward
?
<EOS>
He
have
not
accede
to
her
proposition
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
deny
his
engagement
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
He
have
leave
her
presence
without
a
word
of
encouragement
,
because
of
that
engagement
.
<EOS>
but
he
believe
that
Lizzie
be
sincere
.
<EOS>
He
believe
,
now
,
that
she
be
genuine
;
though
he
have
previously
be
all
but
sure
that
falsehood
and
artifice
be
second
nature
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
at
Bobsborough
he
meet
his
constituent
,
and
make
them
the
normal
autumn
speech
.
<EOS>
the
man
of
Bobsborough
be
well
pleased
and
give
him
a
vote
of
confidence
.
<EOS>
as
none
but
those
of
his
own
party
attend
the
meeting
,
it
be
not
wonderful
that
the
vote
be
unanimous
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
mother
,
and
sister
all
hear
his
speech
,
and
there
be
a
strong
family
feeling
that
Frank
be
bear
to
set
the
Greystocks
once
more
upon
their
leg
.
<EOS>
when
a
man
can
say
what
he
like
with
the
certainty
that
every
word
will
be
report
,
and
can
speak
to
those
around
him
as
one
manifestly
their
superior
,
he
always
loom
large
.
<EOS>
when
the
Conservatives
should
return
to
their
proper
place
at
the
head
of
affair
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
Frank
Greystock
would
be
make
Solicitor
-
General
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
want
even
ardent
admirer
who
conceive
that
,
with
such
claim
and
such
talent
as
his
,
the
ordinary
step
in
political
promotion
would
not
be
need
,
and
that
he
would
become
Attorney
-
General
at
once
.
<EOS>
all
man
begin
to
say
all
good
thing
to
the
dean
,
and
to
Mrs.
Greystock
it
seem
that
the
woolsack
,
or
at
least
the
Queen
's
bench
with
a
peerage
,
be
hardly
an
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
 
there
must
be
no
marriage
with
a
penniless
governess
.
<EOS>
if
he
would
only
marry
his
cousin
one
may
say
that
the
woolsack
be
win
.
  
<EOS>
then
come
Lucy
's
letter
;
the
pretty
,
dear
,
joking
letter
about
the
"
duchess
,
"
and
break
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
break
my
heart
,
only
 
only
 
only
 
"
yes
,
he
know
very
well
what
she
mean
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
call
upon
to
break
my
heart
,
because
you
be
not
a
false
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
a
false
scoundrel
,
 
instead
of
be
,
as
you
be
,
a
pearl
among
man
,
 
then
I
should
break
my
heart
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
Lucy
mean
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
be
much
clear
,
and
he
understand
it
perfectly
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
nice
to
walk
about
one
's
own
borough
and
be
vote
unanimously
worthy
of
confidence
,
and
be
a
great
man
;
but
if
you
be
a
scoundrel
,
and

Lucy
's
letter
require
an
answer
,
and
how
should
he
answer
it
?
<EOS>
He
certainly
do
not
wish
her
to
tell
Lady
Linlithgow
of
her
engagement
,
but
Lucy
clearly
wish
to
be
allow
to
tell
,
and
on
what
ground
could
he
enjoin
her
to
be
silent
?
<EOS>
He
know
,
or
he
think
he
know
,
that
till
he
answer
the
letter
,
she
would
not
tell
his
secret
,
 
and
therefore
from
day
to
day
he
put
off
the
answer
.
<EOS>
a
man
do
not
write
a
love
-
letter
easily
when
he
be
in
doubt
himself
whether
he
do
or
do
not
mean
to
be
a
scoundrel
.
  
<EOS>
then
there
come
a
letter
to
"
Dame
"
Greystock
from
Lady
Linlithgow
,
which
fill
them
all
with
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
my
DEAR
MADAM
,
 
[
begin
the
letter
]
  
see
that
your
son
be
engage
to
marry
Miss
Morris
,
 
<EOS>
at
least
she
say
so
,
 
you
ought
not
to
have
send
her
here
without
tell
me
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
say
you
know
of
the
match
,
and
she
say
that
I
can
write
to
you
if
I
please
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
can
do
that
without
her
leave
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
to
me
that
if
you
know
all
about
it
,
and
approve
the
marriage
,
your
house
and
not
mine
would
be
the
proper
place
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
tell
that
Mr.
Greystock
be
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
any
lady
be
with
me
as
my
companion
can
not
be
a
great
woman
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
want
to
break
it
off
;
 
else
you
would
have
tell
me
.
<EOS>
She
shall
stay
here
six
month
,
but
then
she
must
go
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
truly
,
  
SUSANNA
LINLITHGOW
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
consider
absolutely
necessary
that
this
letter
should
be
show
to
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
say
his
mother
,
"
she
tell
the
old
lady
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
why
she
should
not
.
"
<EOS>
nevertheless
Frank
be
annoy
.
<EOS>
have
ask
for
permission
,
Lucy
should
at
least
have
wait
for
a
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
generally
consider
that
young
lady
be
more
reticent
about
such
thing
.
<EOS>
She
have
blurt
it
out
and
boast
about
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
girl
always
tell
of
their
engagement
,
"
say
Frank
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
<EOS>
see
that
there
be
any
boasting
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
he
be
silent
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
we
be
,
all
of
us
,
treat
Lucy
very
badly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
that
I
see
it
,
"
say
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
ought
to
have
have
her
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
how
long
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
as
long
as
a
home
be
need
by
her
.
"
  
"
have
you
demand
it
,
Frank
,
she
should
have
come
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
neither
I
nor
your
father
could
have
have
pleasure
in
receive
her
as
your
future
wife
.
<EOS>
You
,
yourself
,
say
that
it
can
not
be
for
two
year
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
one
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Frank
,
you
say
two
.
<EOS>
and
we
all
know
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
ruinous
to
you
.
<EOS>
how
could
we
make
her
welcome
?
<EOS>
Can
you
see
your
way
to
have
a
house
for
her
to
live
in
within
twelve
month
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
a
house
?
<EOS>
I
could
have
a
house
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
such
a
house
as
would
suit
you
in
your
position
?
<EOS>
and
,
Frank
,
would
it
be
a
kindness
to
marry
her
and
then
let
her
find
that
you
be
in
debt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
she
would
care
if
she
have
nothing
but
a
crust
to
eat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
ought
to
care
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
say
the
dean
to
his
son
,
on
the
next
day
,
"
that
in
our
class
of
life
an
imprudent
marriage
be
the
one
thing
that
should
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
My
marriage
have
be
very
happy
,
God
know
;
but
I
have
always
be
a
poor
man
,
and
feel
it
now
when
I
be
quite
unable
to
help
you
.
<EOS>
and
yet
your
mother
have
some
fortune
.
<EOS>
nobody
,
I
think
,
care
less
for
wealth
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
content
almost
with
nothing
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
nothing
with
which
the
dean
have
hitherto
be
content
have
always
include
every
comfort
of
life
,
a
well
-
keep
table
,
good
wine
,
new
book
,
and
canonical
habiliment
with
the
gloss
still
on
;
but
as
the
Bobsborough
tradesman
have
,
through
the
agency
of
Mrs.
Greystock
,
always
supply
him
with
these
thing
as
though
they
come
from
the
cloud
,
he
really
do
believe
that
he
have
never
ask
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
content
almost
with
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
feel
that
marriage
can
not
be
adopt
as
the
ordinary
form
of
life
by
man
in
our
class
as
it
can
be
by
the
rich
or
by
the
poor
.
<EOS>
You
,
for
instance
,
be
call
upon
to
live
with
the
rich
,
but
be
not
rich
.
<EOS>
that
can
only
be
do
by
wary
walking
,
and
be
hardly
consistent
with
a
wife
and
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
man
in
my
position
do
marry
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
after
a
certain
age
,
 
or
else
they
marry
lady
with
money
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Frank
,
there
be
not
many
man
who
go
into
Parliament
with
mean
so
moderate
as
yours
;
and
they
who
do
perhaps
have
strict
idea
of
economy
.
<EOS>
"
the
dean
do
not
say
a
word
about
Lucy
Morris
,
and
deal
entirely
with
generality
.
  
<EOS>
in
compliance
with
her
son
's
advice
,
 
or
almost
command
,
 
Mrs.
Greystock
do
not
answer
Lady
Linlithgow
's
letter

<EOS>
He
be
go
back
to
London

and
would
give
personally
,
or
by
letter
write
there
,
what
answer
may
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
then
see
Miss
Morris
?
"
ask
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
certainly
see
Lucy

something
must

settle

there
be
a
tone
in

this

give
some
comfort
to
his

<EOS>
Lizzie

and
for
a
couple
of
day
there

whom
Lizzie
be
very
glad
to

but
of
whose
good

on

Mr.

<EOS>
this

John
Eustace

His

to
Mr.

,
 
he
do
not
wish
to
seem
to
quarrel
with
his

such
seeming
may

he
accept
the
invitation

<EOS>
if
there
be
to
be
a
lawsuit
about
the
diamond

that
must
be
Mr.

affair

<EOS>
Lizzie
have
never

in
style
before
.
<EOS>
She
have
have
a
few
people
to
dine
with
her
in
London
,
and
once
or
twice
have
receive
company
on
an
evening
.
<EOS>
but
in
all
her
London
doing
there
have
be
the
trepidation
of
fear
,
 
to
be
account
for
by
her
youth
and
widowhood
;
and
it
be
at
Portray
,
 
her
own
house
at
Portray

that
it
would
best
become
her
to
exercise
hospitality
.
<EOS>
She

her
time
even
there
,
but
now
she
mean
to
show
her
friend
that
she
have

<EOS>
She

.
<EOS>
He
could
not
come
,
but
send
an
affectionate
answer
,
and
thank
her
for
thinking
of
him
.
<EOS>
many
people
she
ask
who
,
she
feel
sure
,
would
not
come
,
 
and
one
or
two
of
them

audacity
may

perhaps
,
be

to
have

the
rule
principle

which

let

She
would
ride
in

velvet
without

speck
of

though
certainly
turn
thirty

probably
near

London
in
a
straw
hat

yet
it

but
though
her
face
be
plump
and
round
,
there
be
a
power
in
it
,
and
a
look
of
command
,
of
which
it
be
,
perhaps
,
difficult
to
say
in
what
feature
be
the
seat
.
<EOS>
but
in
truth
the
mind
will
lend
a
tone
to
every
feature
,
and
it
be
the
desire
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
heart
to
command
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
the
wonder
of
her
face
be
its
complexion
.
<EOS>
People
say
,
 
before
they
know
her
,
that
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
she
have
be
make
beautiful
for
ever
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
that
too
brilliant
colour
be
almost
always
there
,
cover
the
cheek
but
never
touch
the
forehead
or
the
neck
,
it
would
at
certain
moment
shift
,
change
,
and
even
depart
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
angry
,
it
would
vanish
for
a
moment
and
then
return
intensify
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
chemistry
on
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
cheek
;
and
yet
it
be
a
tint
so
brilliant
and
so
little
transparent
,
as
almost
to
justify
a
conviction
that
it
could
not
be
genuine
.
<EOS>
there
be
those
who
declare
that
nothing
in
the
way
of
complexion
so
beautiful
as
that
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
have
be
see
on
the
face
of
any
other
woman
in
this
age
,
and
there
be
other
who
call
her
an
exaggerated
milkmaid
.
<EOS>
She
be
tall
,
too
,
and
have
learn
so
to
walk
as
though
half
the
world
belong
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
niece
,
Miss
Roanoke
,
be
a
lady
of
the
same
stamp
,
and
of
similar
beauty
,
with
those
addition
and
also
with
those
drawback
which
belong
to
youth
.
<EOS>
She
look
as
though
she
be
four
-
and
-
twenty
,
but
in
truth
she
be
no
more
than
eighteen
.
<EOS>
when
see
beside
her
aunt
,
she
seem
to
be
no
more
than
half
the
eld
lady
's
size
;
and
yet
her
proportion
be
not
insignificant
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
be
tall
,
and
be
as
one
use
to
command
,
and
walk
as
though
she
be
a
young
Juno
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
be
very
dark
,
 
almost
black
,
 
and
very
plentiful
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
large
and
bright
,
though
too
bold
for
a
girl
so
young
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
and
mouth
be
exactly
as
her
aunt
's
,
but
her
chin
be
somewhat
longer
,
so
as
to
divest
her
face
of
that
plump
roundness
which
,
perhaps
,
take
something
from
the
majesty
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
Miss
Roanoke
's
complexion
be
certainly
marvellous
.
<EOS>
no
one
think
that
she
have
be
make
beautiful
for
ever
,
for
the
colour
would
go
and
come
and
shift
and
change
with
every
word
and
every
thought
;
 
but
still
it
be
there
,
as
deep
on
her
cheek
as
on
her
aunt
's
,
though
somewhat
more
transparent
,
and
with
more
delicacy
of
tint
as
the
bright
hue
fade
away
and
become
merged
in
the
almost
marble
whiteness
of
her
skin
.
<EOS>
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
there
be
no
merging
and
fading
.
<EOS>
the
red
and
white
border
one
another
on
her
cheek
without
any
merging
,
as
they
do
on
a
flag
.
  
<EOS>
Lucinda
Roanoke
be
undoubtedly
a
very
handsome
woman
.
<EOS>
It
probably
never
occur
to
man
or
woman
to
say
that
she
be
lovely
.
<EOS>
She
have
sit
for
her
portrait
during
the
last
winter
,
and
her
picture
have
cause
much
remark
in
the
exhibition
.
<EOS>
some
say
that
she
may
be
a
Brinvilliers
,
other
a
Cleopatra
,
and
other
again
a
Queen
of
Sheba
.
<EOS>
in
her
eye
as
they
be
limn
there
have
be
nothing
certainly
of
love
,
but
they
who
liken
her
to
the
egyptian
queen
believe
that
Cleopatra
's
love
have
always
be
use
simply
to
assist
her
ambition
.
<EOS>
They
who
take
the
brinvillier
side
of
the
controversy
be
man
so
use
to
softness
and
flattery
from
woman
as
to
have
learn
to
think
that
a
woman
silent
,
arrogant
,
and
hard
of
approach
,
must
be
always
meditate
murder
.
<EOS>
the
disciple
of
the
Queen
of
Sheba
school
,
who
form
,
perhaps
,
the
more
numerous
party
,
be
lead
to
their
opinion
by
the
majesty
of
Lucinda
's
demeanour
rather
than
by
any
clear
idea
in
their
own
mind
of
the
lady
who
visit
Solomon
.
<EOS>
all
man
,
however
,
agree
in
this
,
that
Lucinda
Roanoke
be
very
handsome
,
but
that
she
be
not
the
sort
of
girl
with
whom
a
man
would
wish
to
stray
away
through
the
distant
beech
-
tree
at
a
picnic
.
  
<EOS>
in
truth
she
be
silent
,
grave
,
and
,
if
not
really
haughty
,
subject
to
all
the
sign
of
haughtiness
.
<EOS>
She
go
everywhere
with
her
aunt
,
and
allow
herself
to
be
walk
out
at
dance
,
and
to
be
accost
when
on
horseback
,
and
to
be
speak
to
at
party
;
but
she
seem
hardly
to
trouble
herself
to
talk
;
 
and
as
for
laugh
,
flirting
,
or
giggle
,
one
may
as
well
expect
such
levity
from
a
marble
Minerva
.
<EOS>
during
the
last
winter
she
have
take
to
hunt
with
her
aunt
,
and
already
could
ride
well
to
hound
.
<EOS>
if
assistance
be
want
at
a
gate
,
or
in
the
management
of
a
fence
,
and
the
servant
who
attend
the
two
lady
be
not
near
enough
to
give
it
,
she
would
accept
it
as
her
due
from
the
man
near
to
her
;
but
she
rarely
do
more
than
bow
her
thank
,
and
,
even
by
young
lord
,
or
hard
-
ride
handsome
colonel
,
or
squire
of
undoubted
thousand
,
she
could
hardly
ever
be
bring
to
what
may
be
call
a
proper
hunting
-
field
conversation
.
<EOS>
all
of
which
thing
be
note
,
and
speak
of
,
and
admire
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
presume
that
Lucinda
Roanoke
be
in
want
of
a
husband
,
and
yet
no
girl
seem
to
take
less
pain
to
get
one
.
<EOS>
a
girl
ought
not
to
be
always
busy
herself
to
bring
down
a
man
,
but
a
girl
ought
to
give
herself
some
charm
.
<EOS>
a
girl
so
handsome
as
Lucinda
Roanoke
,
with
pluck
enough
to
ride
like
a
bird
<EOS>
,
dignity
enough
for
a
duchess
,
and
who
be
undoubtedly
clever
,
ought
to
put
herself
in
the
way
of
take
such
good
thing
as
her
charm
and
merit
would
bring
her
;
 
but
Lucinda
Roanoke
stand
aloof
and
despise
everybody
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
that
Lucinda
be
speak
of
when
her
name
be
mention
;
and
her
name
be
mention
a
good
deal
after
the
opening
of
the
exhibition
of
picture
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
difficulty
about
her
,
 
as
to
who
she
be
.
<EOS>
that
she
be
an
American
be
the
received
opinion
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
as
well
as
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
have
certainly
be
in
New
York
.
<EOS>
Carbuncle
be
a
London
man
;
but
it
be
suppose
that
Mr.
Roanoke
be
,
or
have
be
,
an
American
.
<EOS>
the
received
opinion
be
correct
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
have
be
bear
in
New
York
,
have
be
educate
there
till
she
be
sixteen
,
have
then
be
take
to
Paris
for
nine
month
,
and
from
Paris
have
be
bring
to
London
by
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
always
speak
of
Lucinda
's
education
as
have
be
thoroughly
parisian
.
<EOS>
of
her
own
education
and
antecedent
,
Lucinda
never
speak
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
it
be
,
"
say
a
young
scamp
from
Eton
to
his
eld
sister
,
when
her
character
and
position
be
once
be
discuss
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
heroine
,
and
would
shoot
a
fellow
as
soon
as
look
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
in
that
scamp
's
family
,
Lucinda
be
ever
afterwards
call
the
heroine
.
  
<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
have
attach
himself
to
these
lady
be
a
mystery
;
 
but
then
Lord
George
be
always
mysterious
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
man
,
 
so
consider
,
 
about
forty
-
five
year
of
age
,
who
have
never
do
anything
in
the
manner
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
He
hunt
a
great
deal
,
but
he
do
not
fraternise
with
hunt
man
,
and
would
appear
now
in
this
county
and
now
in
that
,
with
an
utter
disregard
of
grass
,
fence
,
friendship
,
or
fox
.
<EOS>
Leicester
,
Essex
,
Ayrshire
,
or
the
Baron
have
equal
delight
for
him
;
and
in
all
county
he
be
quite
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
own
a
fortune
,
and
have
never
be
know
to
earn
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
early
in
life
he
have
be
apprentice
to
an
attorney
at
Aberdeen
as
George
Carruthers
.
<EOS>
His
third
cousin
,
the
Marquis
of
Killiecrankie
,
have
be
kill
out
hunting
;
the
second
scion
of
the
noble
family
have
fall
at
Balaclava
;
a
third
have
perish
in
the
Indian
Mutiny
;
and
a
fourth
,
who
do
reign
for
a
few
month
,
die
suddenly
,
leave
a
large
family
of
daughter
.
<EOS>
within
three
year
the
four
brother
vanish
,
leave
among
them
no
male
heir
,
and
George
's
eld
brother
,
who
be
then
in
a
West
India
Regiment
,
be
call
home
from
Demerara
to
be
Marquis
of
Killiecrankie
.
<EOS>
by
a
usual
exercise
of
the
courtesy
of
the
Crown
,
all
the
brother
be
make
lord
,
and
some
twelve
year
before
the
date
of
our
story
George
Carruthers
,
who
have
long
since
leave
the
attorney
's
office
at
Aberdeen
,
become
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
.
<EOS>
how
he
live
no
one
know
.
<EOS>
that
his
brother
do
much
for
him
be
presume
to
be
impossible
,
as
the
property
entail
on
the
Killiecrankie
title
certainly
be
not
large
.
<EOS>
He
sometimes
go
into
the
city
,
and
be
suppose
to
know
something
about
share
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
play
a
little
,
and
make
a
few
bet
.
<EOS>
He
generally
live
with
man
of
mean
;
 
or
perhaps
with
one
man
of
mean
at
a
time
;
but
they
who
know
him
well
declare
that
he
never
borrow
a
shilling
from
a
friend
,
and
never
owe
a
guinea
to
a
tradesman
.
<EOS>
He
always
have
horse
,
but
never
have
a
home
.
<EOS>
when
in
London
he
lodge
in
a
single
room
,
and
dine
at
his
club
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
Colonel
of
Volunteers
,
have
get
up
the
regiment
know
as
the
Long
Shore
Riflemen
,
 
the
rough
regiment
of
volunteer
in
all
England
,
 
and
be
repute
to
be
a
bitter
Radical
.
<EOS>
He
be
suspect
even
of
republican
sentiment
,
and
ignorant
young
man
about
London
hint
that
he
be
the
grand
centre
of
the
British
Fenians
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
invite
to
stand
for
the
Tower
Hamlets
,
but
have
tell
the
deputation
which
wait
upon
him
that
he
know
a
thing
worth
two
of
that
.
<EOS>
Would
they
guarantee
his
expense
,
and
then
give
him
a
salary
?
<EOS>
the
deputation
doubt
its
ability
to
promise
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
I
more
than
doubt
it
,
"
say
Lord
George
;
and
then
the
deputation
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
in
person
he
be
a
long
-
legged
,
long
-
bodied
,
long
-
faced
man
,
with
rough
whisker
and
a
rough
beard
on
his
upper
lip
,
but
with
a
shorn
chin
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
very
deep
set
in
his
head
,
and
his
cheek
be
hollow
and
sallow
,
and
yet
he
look
to
be
and
be
a
powerful
,
healthy
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
large
hand
,
which
seem
to
be
all
bone
,
and
long
arm
,
and
a
neck
which
look
to
be
long
because
he
so
wear
his
shirt
that
much
of
his
throat
be
always
bare
.
<EOS>
It
be
manifest
enough
that
he
like
to
have
good
-
look
woman
about
him
,
and
yet
nobody
presume
it
probable
that
he
would
marry
.
<EOS>
for
the
last
two
or
three
year
there
have
be
friendship
between
him
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;
and
during
the
last
season
he
have
become
almost
intimate
with
our
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
think
that
perhaps
he
may
be
the
Corsair
whom
,
sooner
or
later
in
her
life
,
she
must
certainly
encounter
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
who
at
the
present
period
of
his
existence
be
be
lead
about
by
Lord
George
,
be
not
exactly
an
amiable
young
baronet
.
<EOS>
nor
be
his
circumstance
such
as
make
a
man
amiable
.
<EOS>
He
be
nominally
,
not
only
the
heir
to
,
but
actually
the
possessor
of
,
a
large
property
;
 
but
he
could
not
touch
the
principal
,
and
of
the
income
only
so
much
as
certain
legal
curmudgeon
would
allow
him
.
<EOS>
as
Greystock
have
say
,
everybody
be
at
law
with
him
,
 
so
successful
have
be
his
father
in
mismanaging

and
miscontrolling

and
misappropriate
the

<EOS>
Tewett
Hall
have
go
to
rack
and
ruin
for
four
year
,
and
be
now
let
almost
for
nothing

<EOS>
He
be
a
fair
,
frail
young
man
,
with
a
bad
eye
,
and
a
weak
mouth
,
and
a
thin
hand
,
who
be
fond
of
liqueur
,
and
hate
to
the
death
any
acquaintance
who
win
a
five
-
pound
note
of
him
,
or
any
tradesman
who
wish
to
have
his
bill
pay
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
this
redeem
quality
,
 
that
have
find
Lucinda
Roanoke
to
be
the
handsome
woman
he
have
ever
see
,
he
do
desire
to
make
her
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
friend
whom
Lizzie
Eustace
receive
at
Portray
Castle
on
the
first
day
of
her
grand
hospitality
,
 
together
with
John

the

from

<EOS>
Lizzie
's
First
Day
 
<EOS>
the
coming
of
John
Eustace
be
certainly
a
great
thing
for
Lizzie
,
though
it
be
only
for
two
day
.
<EOS>
It
save
her
from
that
feeling

her

desertion
by
those
who

otherwise
have
afflict
her

<EOS>
His
presence
there
for
two
day
give
her
a
start

<EOS>
She
could
call
him
John
,
and
bring
down
her
boy
to
him
,
and
remind
him
,
with
the
sweetest
smile
,
 
with
almost
a

in
her

that
he
be

She

<EOS>
John
Eustace
be
a
thoroughly
good
-
natured
man
of
the
world
,
who
could
forgive
many
fault
,
not
expect
people
to
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
like
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;
 
be
indifferent
to
Lucinda
's
beauty
;
 
be
afraid
of
that
Tartar
,
Lord
George
;
 
and
thoroughly
despise
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
in
his
heart
he
believe
Mr.
Emilius
to
be
an
impostor
,
who
may
,
for
aught
he
know
,
pick
his
pocket
;
and
Miss
Macnulty
have
no
attraction
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
smile
,
and
be
gay
,
and
call
Lady
Eustace
by
her
christian
name
,
and
be
content
to
be
of
use
to
her
in
show
her
friend
that
she
have
not
be
altogether
drop
by
the
Eustace
people
.
<EOS>
"
I
get
such
a
nice
affectionate
letter
from
the
dear
bishop
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
"
but
he
could
not
come
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
escape
a
previous
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
long
way
,
"
say
John
,
"
and
he
be
not
so
young
as
he
be
once
;
 
and
then
there
be
the
Bobsborough
parson
to
look
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
anything
of
that
kind
stop
him
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
who
do
not
think
it
possible
that
a
bishop
's
bliss
should
be
alloy
by
work
.
<EOS>
John
be
so
very
nice
that
she
almost
make
up
her
mind
to
talk
to
him
about
the
necklace
;
but
she
be
cautious
,
and
thought
of
it
,
and
find
that
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
abstain
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
be
certainly
very
good
-
natured
,
but
perhaps
he
may
say
an
ugly
word
to
her
if
she
be
rash
.
<EOS>
She
refrain
,
therefore
,
and
after
breakfast
on
the
second
day
he
take
his
departure
without
an
allusion
to
thing
that
be
unpleasant
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

my

He

I
do
not

it

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
a
little
in
that
way
,
I
think
,
Lady
Eustace
;
 
not
a
demagogue

but
demagognical
;
 
not
a
Bohemian

but
that
way
give

and
be
Miss

demagognical

I
hardly
wrong
you

,
Miss

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucinda
be
a
democrat
,
but
hardly
a
demagogue
,
Lord
George
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
those
be
distinction
which
we
hardly
understand
on
this
thick
-
headed
side
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
but
demagogue
,
democrat
,
demonstration
,
and
demosthenic
oratory
be
all
equally
odious
to
John
Eustace
.
<EOS>
for
a
young
man
he
be
about
the
good
Tory
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
true
to
his
colour
,
"
say
Mr.
Emilius
,
who
have
be
endeavour
to
awake
the
attention
of
Miss
Roanoke
on
the
subject
of
Shakespeare
's
dramatic
action
,
"
and
I
like
man
who
be
true

their
colour

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
speak
with
the
slight
possible
tone
of
a
foreign
accent
,
 
a
tone
so
slight
that
it
simply
serve
to
attract
attention
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
while
Eustace
be
still
in
the
house
,
there
have
come
a
letter
from
Frank
Greystock
,
say
that
he
would
reach
Portray
,
by
way
of
Glasgow
,
on
Wednesday
,
the
5th
of
November
.
<EOS>
He
must
sleep
in
Glasgow
on
that
night
,
have
business
,
or
friend
,
or
pleasure
demand
his
attention
in
that
prosperous
mart
of
commerce
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
impress
upon
him
that
he
should
hunt
,
and
he
have
consent
.
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
a
meet
out
on
the
Kilmarnock
side
of
the
county
on
that
Wednesday
,
and
he
would
bring
a
horse
with
him
from
Glasgow
.
<EOS>
even
in
Glasgow
a
hunter
be
to
be
hire
,
and
could
be
send
forty
or
fifty
mile
out
of
the
town
in
the
morning
and
bring
back
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
learn
all
about
that
,
and
have
tell
him
.
<EOS>
if
he
would
call
at
MacFarlane
's
stable
in
Buchanan
Street
,
or
even
write
to
Mr.
MacFarlane
,
he
would
be
sure
to
get
a
horse
that
would
carry
him
.
<EOS>
MacFarlane
be
send
horse
down
into
the
Ayrshire
country
every
day
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
It
be
simply
an
affair
of
money
.
<EOS>
three
guinea
for
the
horse
,
and
then
just
the
expense
of
the
railway
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
who
know
quite
as
much
about
it
as
do
his
cousin
,
and
who
never
think
much
of
guinea
or
of
railway
ticket
,
promise
to
meet
the
party
at
the
meet
ready
equip
.
<EOS>
His
thing
would
go
on
by
train
,
and
Lizzie
must
send
for
them
to
Troon
.
<EOS>
He
presume
a
beneficent
Providence
would
take
the
horse
back
to
the
bosom
of
Mr.
MacFarlane
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
tenour
of
his
letter
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
do
not
mind
,
he
will
find
himself
astray
,
"
say
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
have
to
go
one
way
by
rail
and
his
horse
another
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
can
manage
better
for
our
cousin
than
that
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
with
a
rebuke
nod
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
hunt
from
Portray
before
Frank
Greystock
come
.
<EOS>
It
be
specially
a
hunting
party
,
and
Lizzie
be
to
be
introduce
to
the
glory
of
the
field
.
<EOS>
in
give
her
her
due
,
it
must
be
acknowledge
that
she
be
fit
for
the
work
.
<EOS>
She
ride
well
,
though
she
have
not
ride
to
hound
,
and
her
courage
be
cool
.
<EOS>
She
look
well
on
horseback
,
and
have
that
presence
of
mind
which
should
never
desert
a
lady
when
she
be
hunt

<EOS>
a
couple
of
horse
have
be
purchase
for
her
,
under
Lord
George
's
superintendence
,
 
his
conjointly
with
Mrs.

and

the
castle
for
the
last
ten
day
 
"
eat
their
varra
heed
off
,
"
as
Andy
Gowran
have
say
in
sorrow
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
practise
even
while
John
Eustace
be
there
,
and
before
her
preceptor
have
sleep
three
night
at
the
castle
,
she
have
ride
backwards
and
forwards
half
-
a
-
dozen
time
over
a
stone
wall
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
,
"
Lucinda
have
say
,
in
answer
to
a
remark
from
Sir
Griffin
,
"
It
be
easy
enough
,
 
till
you
come
across
something
difficult
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
difficult
stop
you
,
"
say
Sir
Griffin
;
 
to
which
compliment
Lucinda
vouchsafe
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Monday
Lizzie
go
out
hunt
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
that
,
as
she
put
her
habit
on
,
and
afterwards
breakfast
with
all
her
guest
in
hunt
gear
around
her
,
and
then
be
drive
with
them
in
her
own
carriage
to
the
meet
,
there
be
something
of
trepidation
at
her
heart
.
<EOS>
and
her
feeling
of
cautious
fear
in
regard
to
money
have
receive
a
shock
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
tell
her
that
a
couple
of
horse
fit
to
carry
her
may
perhaps
cost
her
about
£
180
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
have
receive
the
commission
,
and
the
cheque
require
from
her
have
be
for
£
320
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
have
write
the
cheque
without
a
word
,
but
it
do
begin
to
occur
to
her
that
hunting
be
an
expensive
amusement
.
<EOS>
Gowran
have
inform
her
that
he
have
buy
a
rick
of
hay
from
a
neighbour
for
£
75
15
.
<EOS>
9d
.
<EOS>
"
God
forgie
me
,
"
say
Andy
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
b'lieve
<EOS>
I
have
be
o'er
hard
on
the
puir
man
in
your

's
service
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
£
75
15
.
<EOS>
9d
.
<EOS>
do
seem
a
great
deal
of
money
to
pay
;
and
could
it
be
necessary
that
she
should
buy
a
whole
rick
?
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
eight
horse
in
the
stable
.
<EOS>
to
what
friend
could
she
apply
to
learn
how
much
of
a
rick
of
hay
<EOS>
one
horse
ought
to
eat
in
a
month
of
hunting
?
<EOS>
in
such
a
matter
she
may
have
trust
Andy
Gowran
implicitly
;
but
how
be
she
to
know
that
?
<EOS>
and
then
,
what
if
at
some
desperate
fence
she
be
to
be
throw
off
and
break
her
nose
and
knock
out
her
front
tooth
!
<EOS>
be
the
game
worth
the
candle
?
<EOS>
She
be
by
no
means
sure
that
she
like
Mrs.
Carbuncle
very
much
.
<EOS>
and
though
she
like
Lord
George
very
well
,
could
it
be
possible
that
he
buy
the
horse
for
£
90
each
and
charge
her
£
160
?
<EOS>
corsair
do
do
these
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
the
horse
themselves
be
two
sweet
dear
,
with
star
on
their
forehead
,
and
shine
coat
,
and
a
delicious
aptitude
for
jump
over
everything
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
have
not
,
in
truth
,
make
a
penny
by
them
,
and
they
be
good
hunter
,
worth
the
money
;
 
but
<EOS>
how
be
Lizzie
to
know
that
?
<EOS>
but
though
she
doubt
,
and
be
full
of
fear
,
she
could
smile
and
look
as
though
she
like
it
.
<EOS>
if
the
bad
should
come
she
could
certainly
get
money
for
the
diamond
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
Monday
the
meet
be
comparatively
near
to
them
,
 
distant
only
twelve
mile
.
<EOS>
on
the
follow
Wednesday
it
would
be
sixteen
,
and
they
would
use
the
railway
,
 
have
the
carriage
send
to
meet
them
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
the
three
lady
and
Lord
George
fill
the
carriage
,
and
Sir
Griffin
be
perch
upon
the
box
.
<EOS>
the
lady
"
horse
have
go
on
with
two
groom
,
and
those
for
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
be
to
come
to
the
meet
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
feel
somewhat
proud
of
her
establishment
and
her
equipage
;
 
but
at
the
same
time
somewhat
fearful
.
<EOS>
hitherto
she
know
but
very
little
of
the
county
people
,
and
be
not
sure
how
she
may
be
receive
;
 
and
then
how
would
it
be
with
her
if
the
fox
should
at
once
start
away
across
country
,
and
she
should
lack
either
the
pluck
or
the
power
to
follow
?
<EOS>
there
be
Sir
Griffin
to
look
after
Miss
Roanoke
,
and
Lord
George
to
attend
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
at
last
an
idea
<EOS>
so
horrible
strike
her
that
she
could
not
keep
it
down
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
I
to
do
,
"
she
say
,
"
if
I
find
myself
all
alone
in
a
field
,
and
everybody
else
go
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
treat
you
quite
in
that
fashion
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
only
possible
way
in
which
you
can
be
alone
in
a
field
be
that
you
will
have
cut
everybody
else
down
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
will
all
come
right
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
pluck
up
her
courage
,
and
tell
herself
that
a
woman
can
die
but
once
.
  
<EOS>
everything
be
right
,
 
as
it
usually
be
.
<EOS>
the
horse
be
there
,
 
quite
a
throng
of
horse
,
as
the
two
gentleman
have
two
each
;
and
there
be
,
moreover
,
a
mount
groom
to
look
after
the
three
lady
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
desire
to
have
a
groom
to
herself
,
but
have
be
tell
that
the
expenditure
in
horseflesh
be
more
than
the
stable
could
stand
.
<EOS>
"
all
I
ever
want
of
a
man
be
to
carry
for
me
my
flask
,
and
waterproof
,
and
luncheon
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
if
I
never
see
a
groom
,
except
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
convenient
to
have
a
gate
open
sometimes
,
"
say
Lucinda
,
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
no
one
but
a
groom
do
that
for
you
?
"
ask
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
can
not
open
gate
,
"
say
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
Sir
Griffin
think
that
he
have
open
many
gate
during
the
last
season
for
Miss
Roanoke
,
he
feel
this
to
be
hard
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
eight
horse
,
and
eight
horse
with
three
servant
and
a
carriage
make
quite
a
throng
.
<EOS>
among
the
crowd
of
Ayrshire
hunting
man
,
 
a
lord
or
two
,
a
dozen
laird
,
two
dozen
farmer
,
and
as
many
man
of
business
out
of
Ayr
,
Kilmarnock
,
and
away
from
Glasgow
,
 
it
be
soon
tell
that
Lady
Eustace
and
her
party
be
among
them
.
<EOS>
a
good
deal
have
be
already
hear
of
Lizzie
,
and
it
be
at
least
know
of
her
that
she
have
,
for
her
life
,
the
Portray
estate
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
so
there
be
an
undercurrent
of
whispering
,
and
that
sort
of
commotion
which
the
appearance
of
new
-
comer
do

<EOS>
Lord
George
know
one
or
two
man
,
who
be
surprised
to
find
him
in
Ayrshire
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
soon
quite
at
home
with
a
young
nobleman
whom
she
have
meet
in
the
vale
with
the
Baron

<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
do
not
leave
Lucinda
's
side
,
and
for
a
while
poor
Lizzie
feel
herself
alone
in
a
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
who
do
not
know
that
terrible
feeling
,
and
the
all
but
necessity
that
exist
for
the
sufferer
to
pretend
that
he
be
not
suffer
,
 
which
again
be
aggravate
by
the
conviction
that
the
pretence
be
utterly
vain
?
<EOS>
this
may
be
bad
with
a
man
,
but
with
a
woman
,
who
never
look
to
be
alone
in
a
crowd
,
it
be
terrible
.
<EOS>
for
five
minute
,
during
which
everybody
else
be
speak
to
everybody
,
 
for
five
minute
,
which
seem
to
her
to
be
an
hour
,
Lizzie
speak
to
no
one
,
and
no
one
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
be
it
for
such
misery
as
this
that
she
be
spend
hundred
upon
hundred
,
and
run
herself
into
debt
?
<EOS>
for
she
be
sure
that
there
would
be
debt
before
she
have
part
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
there
be
people
,
very
many
people
,
to
whom
an
act
of
hospitality
be
in
itself
a
good
thing
;
but
there
be
other
who
be
always
make
calculation
,
and
endeavour
to
count
up
the
thing
purchase
against
the
cost
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
be
tell
that
she
be
a
rich
woman
,
 
as
woman
go
,
very
rich
.
<EOS>
surely
she
be
entitle
to
entertain
a
few
friend
;
and
if
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Miss
Roanoke
could
hunt
,
it
could
not
be
that
hunting
be
beyond
her
own
mean
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
be
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
a
large
waggon
load
with
sack
of
corn
come
up
the
hill
to
the
Portray
stable
,
and
she
know
that
there
would
be
a
long
bill
at
the
corn
-
chandler
's
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
find
a
supply
of
wine
in
the
cellar
at
Portray
,
 
which
at
her
request
have
be
inspect
by
her
cousin
Frank
;
 
but
it
have
be
necessary
,
so
he
have
tell
her
,
to
have
much
more
send
down
from
London
,
 
champagne
,
and
liqueur
,
and
other
nice
thing
that
cost
money
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
like
not
to
have
them
if
these
people
be
come
?
"
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
;
certainly
not
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
with
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
what
other
rich
people
do
,
she
would
do
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
in
her
five
minute
of
misery
,
she
count
it
all
up
,
and
be
at
a
loss
to
find
what
be
to
be
her
return
for
her
expenditure
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
on
this
her
first
day
she
should
have
a
fall
,
with
no
tender
hand
to
help
her
,
and
then
find
that
she
have
knock
out
her
front
tooth
!
  
<EOS>
but
the
cavalcade
begin
to
move
,
and
then
Lord
George
be
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
be
angry
if
I
seem
to
stick
too
close
to
you
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
She
give
him
her
sweetest
smile
as
she
tell
him
that
that
would
be
impossible
.
"
<EOS>
because
,
you
know
,
though
it
be
the
easy
thing
in
the
world
to
get
along
out
hunting
,
and
woman
never
come
to
grief
,
a
person
be
a
little
astray
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
so
much
astray
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
at
all
know
how
we
be
go
to
begin
.
<EOS>
be
we
hunt
a
fox
now
?
<EOS>
"
at
this
moment
they
be

across
a
field
or
two

through
a

of
gate
up
to
the

not

<EOS>
the

You

<EOS>
I

they
will
draw
that

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be

,
Lord
George

<EOS>
I
want
to
know
all
about
it
,

I
be
so
ignorant
.
<EOS>
nobody
else
will
tell
me
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lord
George
give
his
lesson
,
and
explain
the
theory
and
system
of
fox
-
hunting
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
to
wait
here
,
then
,
till
the
fox
run
away
?
<EOS>
but
it
be
ever
so
large
,
and
if
he
run
away
,
and
nobody
see
him
?
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
,
because
it
will
be
nice
to
go
on
easily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
great
many
people
hope
that
,
and
a
great
many
think
it
nice
to
go
on
easily
.
<EOS>
only
you
must
not
confess
to
it
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
go
on
with
his
lecture
,
and
explain
the
meaning
of
scent
,
be
great
on
the
difficulty
of
get
away
,
describe
the
iniquity
of
head
the
fox
,
speak
of
up
wind
and
down
wind
,
get
as
far
as
the
trouble
of
"
carry
,
"
and
tell
her
that
a
good
ear
be
everything
in
a
big
wood
,
 
when
there
come
upon
them
the
thrice
-
repeat
note
of
an
old
hound
's
voice
,
and
the
quick
scampering
,
and
low
,
timid
,
anxious
,
trustful
whinnying
of
a
dozen
comrade
young
hound
,
who
recognise
the
sagacity
of
their
well

highly
-
appreciate
elder

<EOS>
"
that
be

<EOS>
"
what
shall
I
do

all
in

therefore
you
must

about

<EOS>
there
be
a
matter
of
a
hundred

twenty
acre
here

I
should
say
,

a
fox
do
not

<EOS>
Lizzie
be
very
tired
,
and
,
when
Lord
George
take
her
from
her
horse
,
could
almost
have
cry
from
fatigue
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
never

but
she
have
become
damp
,
 
soak
wet
through

as
she

,
 
during
the

that
the

absent
with
her
waterproof
jacket
,
and
could
not
bring
herself
to
forget
the
ill

usage
she
have
suffer
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
have
become
absolutely
dumb
,
and
any
observer
would
have
fancy
that
the
two
gentleman
have
quarrel
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
go
on
the
box
now
,

Sir

<EOS>
"
when
you

I
will

take
his

<EOS>
then

appeal
to
Lizzie

<EOS>
"
You
will
let
me
smoke

will
not

"
<EOS>
She

<EOS>
and
so
they
go
home

and
the
lady

<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
she

<EOS>
there

stair
between
Mrs.

<EOS>
"
It

Mrs.

carruther

sooner

<EOS>
You
may
do
better

perhaps

you

<EOS>
We
can
not

you

<EOS>

if

you

<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
talk
to
him

<EOS>
I
do
not

he
be
at
all
a
bad
fellow

<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing

He

It

I

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me
,
"
say
Lucinda
,
"
that
one
be
as
bad

<EOS>
I
would
a

sooner

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that

<EOS>
Mrs.

,
who
probably
feel
that
she

ill
about
the

in
regard
to
Scotland

almost
make
an
apology

and
explain
that

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

My

musical
foreign
tone

Miss

I
do
not

do
we

<EOS>
"
no

indeed

say
Miss
Macnulty
,
who
have
like
the
society

Mr.

<EOS>
but
on
this
morning
there
be
an
attraction
for
Lizzie
which
the
Monday
have
want
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
meet
her
cousin
,
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
the
journey
be
long
,
and
the
horse
have
go
on
over
night
.
<EOS>
They
go
by
railway
to
Kilmarnock
,
and
there
a
carriage
from
the
inn
have
be
order
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
she
hear
the
order
give
,
wonder
whether
she
would
have
to
pay
for
that
,
or
whether
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
would
take
so
much
off
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
young
woman
generally
pay
for
nothing
;
and
it
be
very
hard
that
she
,
who
be
quite
a
young
woman
,
should
have
to
pay
for
all
.
<EOS>
but
she
smile
,
and
accept
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
;
of
course
a
carriage
at
the
station
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
nice
to
have
some
one
to
think
of
thing
,
like
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
carriage
meet
them
,
and
everything
go
prosperously
.
<EOS>
almost
the
first
person
they
see
be
Frank
Greystock
,
in
a
black
coat
,
indeed
,
but
ride
a
superb
grey
horse
,
and
look
quite
as
though
he
know
what
he
be
about
.
<EOS>
He
be
introduce
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Miss
Roanoke
and
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
with
Lord
George
he
have
some
slight
previous
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
have
no
difficulty
about
a
horse
?
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
the
slight
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
in
an
awful
fright
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
write
to
MacFarlane
from
London
,
and
absolutely
have
not
a
moment
to
go
to
his
place
yesterday
or
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
be
stay
over
at
Glenshiels
,
and
have
not
a
moment
to
spare
in
catch
the
train
.
<EOS>
but
I
find
a
horse
-
box
on
,
and
a
lad
from
MacFarlane
's
just
leave
as
I
come
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
he
send
a
boy
down
with
the
horse
?
"
ask
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
there
be
a
boy
,
and
the
boy'll
be
awfully
bothered
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
to
book
the
horse
for
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
always
do
book
for
Kilmarnock
for
this
meet
,
"
say
a
gentleman
who
have
make
acquaintance
with
some
of
Lizzie
's
party
on
the
previous
hunting
-
day
;
 
"
<EOS>
but
Stewarton
be
ever
so
much
near
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
somebody
tell
me
in
the
carriage
,
"
continue
Frank
,
"
and
I
contrive
to
get
my
box
off
at
Stewarton
.
<EOS>
the
guard
be
uncommon
civil
,
and
so
be
the
porter
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
a
moment
to
look
for
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
make
my
fellow
stick
to
his
horse
,
"
say
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
see
,
Sir
Griffin
,
I
have
not
get
a
fellow
,
and
I
have
only
hire
a
horse
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
hire
a
good
many
horse
from
Mr.
MacFarlane
if
he
will
always
put
me
up
like
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
you
be
here
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
be
I.
<EOS>
I
hunt
about
twice
in
three
year
,
and
no
man
like
it
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
have
still
get
to
find
out
whether
the
beast
can
jump
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
any
mortal
thing
alive

"
say
one
of
those
horsey
-
look
man
who
be
to
be
find
in
all
hunting
-
field
,
who
wear
old
brown
breech
,
old
black
coat
,
old
hunting
-
cap
,
who
ride
screw
,
and
never
get
throw
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
him
,
do
you
?
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
as
Muster
MacFarlane
own
him
.
<EOS>
no
more
he
do
not
,
"
say
the
horsey
man
,
turn
aside
to
one
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
Nappie
's
horse
,
from
Jamaica
Street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
possible
,
"
say
the
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
tell
me
I
do
not
know
my
own
horse
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
you
ever
own
one
,
"
say
the
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
in
truth
delighted
to
have
her
cousin
beside
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
at
any
rate
,
forgive
what
she
have
say
to
him
at
his
last
visit
,
or
he
would
not
have
be
there
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
too
,
there
be
a
feeling
of
reality
in
her
connexion
with
him
,
which
be
sadly
want
to
her
,
 
unreal
as
she
be
herself
,
 
in
her
acquaintance
with
the
other
people
around
her
.
<EOS>
and
on
this
occasion
three
or
four
people
speak
or
bow
to
her
,
who
have
only
stare
at
her
before
;
and
the
huntsman
take
off
his
cap
,
and
hope
that
he
would
do
something
well
for
her
than
on
the
previous
Monday
.
<EOS>
and
the
huntsman
be
very
courteous
also
to
Miss
Roanoke
,
express
the
same
hope
,
cap
in
hand
,
and
smile
graciously
.
<EOS>
a
huntsman
at
the
beginning
of
any
day
or
at
the
end
of
a
good
day
be
so
different
from
a
huntsman
at
the
end
of
a
bad
day
!
<EOS>
a
huntsman
often
have
a
very
bad
time
out
hunting
,
and
it
be
sometimes
a
marvel
that
he
do
not
take
the
advice
which
Job
get
from
his
wife
.
<EOS>
but
now
all
thing
be
smile
,
and
it
be
soon
know
that
his
lordship
intend
to
draw
Craigattan
Gorse
.
<EOS>
now
in
those
part
there
be
no
surer
find
,
and
no
well
chance
of
a
run
,
than
Craigattan
Gorse
afford
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
one
thing
I
want
to
ask
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
"
say
Lord
George
,
in
Lizzie
's
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
ask
two
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
to
coach
Lady
Eustace
to
-
day
;
 
you
or
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
let
me
have
somebody
to
coach
me
,
"

<EOS>
"

devotion
in

Frank

"
devotion

that
is

to
my
cousin

I
defy
the
world

in
point
of
skill
I
yield
to
Lord
George

"
  
<EOS>
"
My
pretension
be
precisely
the
same
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
glow
with
devotion
;
my
skill
be
naught

"
I
like
you
best

question

<EOS>
"
altogether

take
off
his
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
as
a
coach
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
understand
the
extent
of
the
preference
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
delighted
,
and
think
the
game
be
worth
the
candle
.
<EOS>
the
noble
master
have
tell
her
that
they
be
sure
of
a
run
from
Craigattan
,
and
she
be
not
in
the

tired
,
and
they
be
not
call
upon
to
stand
still
in
a
big
wood
,
and

not

,
and
,

very
different
from

<EOS>
mount
on
a
bright
-
skinned
,
lively
steed
,
with

cousin
on
one
side

Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
on
the
other

with
all
the
hunting
world
of

county
civil
around
her
,
and
a
fox
just
find
in
Craigattan
Gorse
,
what
could
the
heart
of
woman
desire
more
?
<EOS>
this
be
to
live
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
just
enough
of
fear
to
make
the
blood
run
quickly
to
her
heart
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
be
away
at
once
now
,
"
say
Lord
George
with
utmost
earnestness
;
"
follow
me
close
,
but
not
too
close
.
<EOS>
when
the
man
see
that
I

you
a
lead

they
will
not
come
between

<EOS>
if

just
check
your

to
his
fence

if
you

see
me
over
before

now
then

there

down
in
the
first
two

we
shall
have
a
run

<EOS>
Lizzie
understand
most
of
it
,
 
more
at

than
would
nine
out
of
ten
young
woman
who

<EOS>
She
be
to
go
wherever

desirous
of
do
the
good
he
can
with
his
day

<EOS>
when
the
hound
come
out
and
cross
the
brook
at
the
end
of
the
gorse
,
perhaps
he
be
a
little
too
forward
.
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
the
state
of
affair
do
not
leave
much
time
for
waiting
,
or
for
the
etiquette
of
the
hunting
-
field
.
<EOS>
along
the
opposite
margin
of
the
brook
there
run
a
low
paling
,
which
make
the
water
a
rather
nasty
thing
to
face
.
<EOS>
a
circuit
of
thirty
or
forty
yard
give
the
easy
riding
of
a
little
bridge
,
and
to
that
all
the
crowd
hurry
.
<EOS>
but
one
or
two
man
with
good
eye
,
and
heart
as
good
,
have
see
the
lead
hound
across
the
brook
turn
up
the
hill
away
from
the
bridge
,
and
know
that
two
most
necessary
minute
may
be
lose
in
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Frank
do
as
they
do
,
have
see
nothing
of
any
hound
,
but
with
instinctive
knowledge
that
they
be
man
likely
to
be
right
in
a
hunting
-
field
.
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
not
Nappie
's
horse
,
I
will
eat
him
,
"
say
one
of
the
lead
man
to
the
other

as
all
the
three

breast
the
hill
together

<EOS>
Frank
only
know
that
he
have
be
carry
over
water
and
timber
without
a
mistake
,
and
feel
a
glow
of
gratitude
towards
Mr.
MacFarlane
.
<EOS>
up
the
hill
they
go
,
and
,
not
wait
to
inquire
into
the
circumstance
of
a
little
gate
,
jump
a
four
-
foot
wall
and
be
away
.
<EOS>
"
how
the
mischief
do
he
get
atop
of
Nappie
's
horse
?
"
say
the
horsey
man
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
about
right
for
it
now
,
"
say
the
huntsman
,
as
he
come
up
alongside
of
Frank
.
<EOS>
He
have
cross
the
bridge
,
but
have
be
the
first
across
it
,
and
know
how
to
get
over
his
ground
quickly
.
<EOS>
on
they
go
,
the
horsey
man
lead
on
his
thoroughbred
screw
,
the
huntsman
second
,
and
Frank
third
.
<EOS>
the
pace
have
already
be
too
good
for
the
other
horsey
man
.
  
<EOS>
when
Lord
George
and
Lizzie
have
mount
the
hill
,
there
be
a
rush
of
horse
at
the
little
gate
.
<EOS>
as
they
top
the
hill
Lucinda
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle

jump
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
look
back
and
ask
a
question
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
answer
it
as
mutely
,
jump
it
!
<EOS>
She
be
already
a
little
short
of
breath
,
but
she
be
ready
to
jump
anything
that
Lucinda
Roanoke
have
jump
.
<EOS>
over
go
Lord
George
,
and
she
follow
him
almost
without
lose
the
stride
of
her
horse
.
<EOS>
surely
in
all
the
world
there
be
nothing
equal
to
this
!
<EOS>
there
be
a
large
grass
field
before
them
,
and
for
a
moment
she
come
up
alongside
of
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
just
steady
him
before
he
leap
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
She
nod
her
assent
,
and
smile
her
gratitude
.
<EOS>
She
have
plenty
of
breath
for
riding
,
but
none
for
speak
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
very
near
to
Lucinda
,
and
Sir
Griffin
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
the
pace
be
too
good
for
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
horse
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
oh
,
if
she
could
only
pass
them
,
and
get
up
to
those
man
whom
she
see
before
her
!
<EOS>
She
know
that
one
of
them
be
her
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
wish
to
pass
them
,
but
she
do
wish
that
he
should
see
her
.
<EOS>
in
the
next
fence
Lord
George
spy
a
rail
,
which
he
think
safe
than
a
blind
hedge
,
and
he
make
for
it
.
<EOS>
His
horse
take
it
well
,
and
so
do
Lizzie
's
;
but
Lizzie
jump
it
a
little
too
near
him
,
as
he
have
pause
an
instant
to
look
at
the
ground
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
will
not
do
it
again
,
"
she
say
,
collect
all
her
breath
for
an
apology
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
admirably
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
your
horse
be
worth
double
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
be
so
glad
now
that
he
have
not
spare
for
price
in
mount
her
.
<EOS>
look
to
the
right
she
could
see
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
only
just
flounder
through
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
be
still
ahead
,
but
Sir
Griffin
be
fall
behind
,
as
though
divide
in
duty
between
the
niece
and
the
aunt
.
<EOS>
then
they
pass
through
a
gate
,
and
Lord
George
stay
his
horse
to
hold
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
thank
him
but
he
stop
her
.
"
<EOS>
do
not
mind
talk
,
but
come
along
;
and
take
it
easy
.
"
<EOS>
She
smile
again
,
and
he
tell
himself
that
she
be
wondrous
pretty
.
<EOS>
and
then
her
pluck
be
so
good
!
<EOS>
and
then
she
have
four
thousand
a
year
!
"
<EOS>
now
for
the
gap
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
be
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
You
first
,
and
I
will
follow
you
to
keep
off
these
two
man
.
<EOS>
keep
to
the
left
,
where
the
other
horse
have
be
.
"
<EOS>
on
they
go
,
and
Lizzie
be
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
quite
understand
her
feeling
,
because
it
have
come
to
that
with
her
that
to
save
her
life
she
could
not
have
speak
a
word
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
be
not
only
happy
but
comfortable
.
<EOS>
the
leaping
be
delightful
,
and
her
horse
gallop
with
her
as
though
his
pleasure
be
as
great
as
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
she
be
get
near
to
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
for
her
,
in
her
heart
,
Lucinda
be
the
quarry
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
only
pass
Lucinda
!
<EOS>
that
there
be
any
hound
she
have
altogether
forget
.
<EOS>
She
only
know
that
two
or
three
man
be
lead
the
way
,
of
whom
her
cousin
Frank
be
one
,
that
Lucinda
Roanoke
be
follow
them
closely
,
and
that
she
be
gain
upon
Lucinda
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
She
know
she
be
gain
a
little
,
because
she
could
see
now
how
well
and
squarely
Lucinda
sit
upon
her
horse
.
<EOS>
as
for
herself
,
she
fear
that
she
be
roll
;
 
but
she
nee
not
have
fear
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
small
,
and
lithe
,
and
light
,
that
her
body
adapt
itself
naturally
to
the
pace
of
her
horse
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
be
of
a
different
build
,
and
it
behove
her
to
make
for
herself
a
perfect
seat
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
have
the
wall
,
"
say
Lord
George
,
who
be
again
at
her
side
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
"
have
"
a
castle
wall
,
moat
include
,
turret
and
all
,
if
he
would
only
have
show
her
the
way
.
<EOS>
the
huntsman
and
Frank
have
take
the
wall
.
<EOS>
the
horsey
man
's
bit
of
blood
,
know
his
own
power
to
an
inch
,
have
decline
,
 
not
roughly
,
with
a
sudden
stop
and
a
jerk
,
but
with
a
swerve
to
the
left
which
the
horsey
man
at
once
understand
.
<EOS>
what
the
brute
lack
in
jump
he
could
make
up
in
pace
,
and
the
horsey
man
be
along
the
wall
and
over
a
broken
bank
at
the
head
of
it
,
with
the
loss
of
not
more
than
a
minute
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
's
horse
,
follow
the
ill
example
,
balk
the
jump
.
<EOS>
She
turn
him
round
with
a
savage
gleam
in
her
eye
which
Lizzie
be
just
near
enough
to
see
,
strike
him
rapidly
over
the
shoulder
with
her
whip
,
and
the
animal
fly
with
her
into
the
next
field
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
if
I
could
do
it
like
that
!
"
think
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
but
in
that
very
minute
she
be
do
it
,
not
only
as
well
but
well
.
<EOS>
not
follow
Lord
George
,
but
close
at
his
side
,
the
little
animal
change
his
pace
,
trot
for
a
yard
or
two
,
hop
up
as
though
the
wall
be
nothing
,
knock
off
a
top
stone
with
his
hind
foot
,
and
drop
onto
the
ground
so
softly
that
Lizzie
hardly
believe
that
she
have
go
over
the
big
obstruction
that
have
cost
Lucinda
such
an
effort
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
's
horse
come
down
on
all
four
leg
,
with
a
grunt
and
a
groan
,
and
she
know
that
she
have
bustle
him
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
Lucinda
be
very
full
of
wrath
against
the
horsey
man
with
the
screw
who
have
be
in
her
way
.
"
<EOS>
He

it
,
"
gasp
Lizzie
,
think
that
her
horse
have
disgrace
himself
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
worth
his
weight
in
gold
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
come
along
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
brook
with
a
ford

<EOS>
Morgan

<EOS>
Morgan

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

no

<EOS>
She
would
let
no
one
get
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
do
her
very
good
,
and
just
get
her
horse
's
nose
on
the
broken
track
lead
down
into
the
brook
before
Lucinda

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
pretty
good
,
be
not
it
?
"
say
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
smile
sweetly
.
<EOS>
She
could
smile
,
though
she
could
not
speak
.
"
<EOS>
only
they
do
balk
one
so
at
one

fence

say
Lucinda

<EOS>
the
horsey
man
have
all
but
regain
his
place
,
and
be
immediately
behind
Lucinda
,
within
hearing
 
as
Lucinda
know
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
further
side
of
the
field
,
beyond
the
brook
,
there
be
a
little
spinny
,
and
for
half
a
minute
the
hound
come
to
a
check
.
<EOS>
"
give

Morgan
to
Frank

speak
in
full
good
humour

"
<EOS>
Carstairs
be
the
horsey
man

and
one
with

often

.
<EOS>
"
that

it
,
my
heartie

"
and
Morgan
be
across
a
broken
wall
in
a
moment
,
after
the
lead
hound
.
<EOS>
"
be
we
to
go
on
?
"
say
Lizzie
,
who
fear
much
that
Lucinda
would
get
ahead
of
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
matter
of
three
dozen
horseman
up
now
,
and
,
as
far
as
Lizzie
see
,
the
whole
thing
may
have
to
be
do
again
.
<EOS>
in
hunting
,
to
have
ride
be
the
pleasure
;
 
and
not
simply
to
have
ride
well
,
but
to
have
ride
better
than
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
call
it
very
awkward
ground
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
come
up
.
<EOS>
"
It

a
half
high

the
noble
master

<EOS>
but
the
hound
be
away
again

Lizzie
have
get
across
the
gap
before
Lucinda

who
,
indeed
,
make
way
for
her
hostess
with
a
haughty
politeness
which
be
not
lose
upon
Lizzie

<EOS>
Lizzie
could
not
stop
to
beg
pardon
,
but
she
would
remember
to
do
it
in
her
prettiest
way
on
their
journey
home
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
on
a
track
of
open
country
,
and
the
pace
be
quicker
even
than
before
.
<EOS>
the
same
three
man
be
still
lead
,
Morgan
,
Greystock
,
and
Carstairs
.
<EOS>
Carstairs
have
slightly
the
good
of
it
;
and
of
course
Morgan
swear
afterwards
that
he
be
among
the
hound
the
whole
run
.
<EOS>
"

all

that
Jack
Morgan

<EOS>
there
be
need
,
indeed
,
now
for
gallop
,
and
it
may
be
doubt
whether
Morgan
himself
be
not

his
good

<EOS>
there
be
about

so
that
it
could
be

but
Lucinda

press
on
,
and
her
animal
go
with
a
long
stride
than
Lizzie

<EOS>
They
now
cross
a
road
,
descend
a
hill
,
and
be
again
in
a
close
country
.
<EOS>
a
few
low
hedge
seem
as
nothing
to
Lizzie

<EOS>
She
could
see
her
cousin
gallop
over
them
ahead

nothing

horse

exactly
the

<EOS>
on
a
sudden
they

themselves
abreast

He

her
brute
come

and
,
but
that

<EOS>
Lord

take
the
leap
before
he
take
it
,
know
that
,
if
there
be
misfortune
,
he
may
so
good
render
help

<EOS>
to
Lizzie
it
seem
as
though
the
river
be
the
black
,
and
the
deep
,
and
the
broad
that
ever
run
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
her
heart
quail
;
 
but
it
be
but
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
shut
her
eye
,
and
give
the
little
horse
his
head
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
she
think
that
she
be
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
Her
horse
be
almost
upright
on
the
bank
,
with
his
hind
-
foot
down
among
the
broken
ground
,
and
she
be
cling
to
his
neck
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
light
,
and
the
beast
make
good
his
footing
,
and
then
she
know
that
she
have
do
it
.
<EOS>
in
that
moment
of
the
scramble
her
heart
have
be
so
near

<EOS>
when
she
look
round
,
Lord

be
already
by

<EOS>
"
You

he

,
"
but
still

beautifully

<EOS>
good

<EOS>
Miss

"
<EOS>
Lizzie
look
back
,
and
there
,
in
truth
,
be
Lucinda
struggle
with
her
horse
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
They
pause
a
moment
,
and
then
there
be
three
or
four
man
assist
her
.
"
<EOS>
come
on
,
"
say
Lord
George
;
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
plenty
to
take
her
out
,
and
we
could
not
get
to

if
we
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
stop
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

say
Lord

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
be
all
right

"
<EOS>
so
instigate
,
Lizzie
follow
her
leader
up
the
hill
,
and
in
a
minute
be
close
upon
Morgan
's
heel
.
  
<EOS>
the
bad
of
do
a
big
thing
out
hunting
be
the
fact
that
in
nine
case
out
of
ten
they
who
do
not
do
it
be
as
well
off
as
they
who
do
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
penalty
for
ride
round
,
or
any
mark
give
to
those
who
have
ride
straight
,
 
so
that
justice
may
in
some
sort
be
do
,
 
it
would
perhaps
be
well
.
<EOS>
when
you
have
nearly
break
your
neck
to
get
to
hound
,
or
make
your
horse
exert
himself
beyond
his
proper
power
,
and
then
find
yourself
,
within
three
minute
,
overtake
the
hindmost
ruck
of
horseman
on
a
road
because
of
some
iniquitous
turn
that
the
fox
have
take
,
the
feeling
be
not
pleasant
.
<EOS>
and
some
man
who
have
not
ride
at
all
,
who
never
do
ride
at
all
,
will
ask
you
where
you
have
be
;
and
his
smile
will
give
you
the
lie
in
your
tooth
if
you
make
any
attempt
to
explain
the
fact
.
<EOS>
let
it
be
sufficient
for
you
at
such
a
moment
to
feel
that
you
be
not
ashamed
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
self
-
respect
will
support
a
man
even
in
such
misery
as
this
.
  
<EOS>
the
fox
on
this
occasion
,
have
cross
the
river
,
have
not
leave
its
bank
,
but
have
turn
from
his
course
up
the
stream
,
so
that
the
lead
spirit
who
have
follow
the
hound
over
the
water
come
upon
a
crowd
of
rider
on
the
road
in
a
space
something
short
of
a
mile
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
among
other
,
be
there
,
and
have
hear
of
Lucinda
's
mishap
.
<EOS>
She
say
a
word
to
Lord
George
in
anger
,
and
Lord
George
answer
her
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
over
the
river
before
it
happen
,
and
if
we
have
give
our
eye
we
could
not
have
get
to
her
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
make
a
fool
of
yourself
!
"
<EOS>
the
last
word
be
speak
in
a
whisper
,
but
Lizzie
's
sharp
ear
catch
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
oblige
to
do
what
I
be
tell
,
"
say
Lizzie
apologetically
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
all

Sir

"
  
<EOS>
They
be
off
again
now
,
and
the
stupid
fox
absolutely
go
back
across
the
river
.
<EOS>
but
,
whether
on
one
side
or
on
the
other
,
his
struggle
for
life
be
now
in
vain
.
<EOS>
two
year
of
happy
,
free
existence
amidst
the
wild
of
Craigattan
have
be
allow
him
.
<EOS>
twice
previously
have
he
be
"
find

"
and
the
kindly
storm
or
not
less
beneficent
brightness
of
the
sun
have
enable
him
to
baffle
his
pursuer
.
<EOS>
now
there
have
come
one
glorious
day
,
and
the
common
lot
of
mortal
must
be
his
.
<EOS>
a
little
spurt
there
be
,
back
towards
his
own
home
,
 
just
enough
to
give
something
of
selectness
to
the
few
who
see
him
fall
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
fall
.
<EOS>
among
the
few
be
Frank
,
and
Lord
George
,
and
our
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Morgan
be
there
,
of
course
,
and
one
of
his
whip
.
<EOS>
of
Ayrshire
folk
,
perhaps
five
or
six
,
and
among
them
our
friend
Mr.
Carstairs
.
<EOS>
They
have
run
him
down
close
to
the
outbuilding
of
a
farm
-
yard
,
and
they
break
him
up
in
the
home
paddock
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of

"
say
Frank
to
his

<EOS>
"
It

to

<EOS>
"
like

<EOS>
You

"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
have
,
"

Frank
,
pat
his

palpitate
horse

and
he
be
not

tired
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
take

pretty
well
out
of

"
say
Carstairs
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
little
bit
of
hill
that

I

know'd
<EOS>
you
would
find
he
would
jump
a
bit

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
he
be
to
be
buy
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Frank
in
his
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
the
horse
that
be
not

"
say
Mr.
Carstairs
,
 
"
so
long

you
do
not

"
  
<EOS>
They
be
collect
on
the
farm
road
,
and
now
,
as
they
be
speak
,
there
be
a
commotion
among
the
horse
.
<EOS>
a
man
,
drive
a
little
buggy
,
be
force
his
way
along
the
road

and
there
be
a
sound
of
voice
,
as
though
the
man
in
the
buggy
be
angry
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
very
angry
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
who
be
on
foot
by
his
horse
's
head
,
could
see
that
the
man
be
dress
for
hunting
,
with
a
bright
red
coat
and
a
flat
hat
,
and
that
he
be
drive
the
pony
with
a
hunting

whip
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
talk
as
he
approach
,
but
what
he
say
do
not
much
matter
to
Frank
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
much
matter
to
Frank
till
his
new
friend
,
Mr.

,
whisper
a
word
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
then
there
creep
across
Frank

an

there
may
be
trouble
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
he
be

say
Nappie
,
bring
his

the
reader
will
understand
;
but
quite
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Nappie
in
his
wrath
would
not
hear
a
word
.
<EOS>
but
now
that
he
speak
about
money
,
Frank
think
that
he
see
an
opening
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Nappie
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
will
buy
the
horse
for
the
price
you
give
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
you
 
---
;
extremely
well
 
---
first
,
"
say
Mr.
Nappie
.
  
<EOS>
the
horse
have
now
be
surrender
to
Mr.
Nappie
,
and
Frank
suggest
that
he
may
as
well
return
to
Kilmarnock
in
the
gig
,
and
pay
for
the
hire
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Nappie
would
not
allow
him
to
set
a
foot
upon
the
gig
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
gig
for
the
day
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
you
do
not
touch
it
.
<EOS>
You
shall
foot
it
all
the
way
back
to
Kilmarnock
,
Mr.
Greystockings
.
"
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Nappie
,
in
make
this
threat
,
forget
that
there
be
gentleman
there
with
second
horse
.
<EOS>
Frank

to
Lord
George

and
Lord

the
corner
of
the

get
into
the
buggy
,
and
be
drive
back
to
Kilmarnock
by
the
man
who
have
accompany
poor
Mr.
Nappie
in
their
morning
's
hunt
on
wheel
after
the
hound
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
I
be
very
sorry
,
"
say
Frank
as
he
ride
back
with
his
friend
to
Kilmarnock
;
"
and
when
I
first
really
understand
what
have
happen
,
I
would
have
do
anything
.
<EOS>
but
what
could
I
say
?
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
not
to
laugh
,
he
be
so
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
put
my
whip
over
his
shoulder
,
"
say
a
stout
farmer
,
mean
to
be
civil
to
Frank
Greystock
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
after
use
it
so
often
over
his
horse
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
have
to
touch
him
once
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
you
to
have
it
all
for
nothing
?
"
ask
the
thoughtful
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
send
a
bill
in
,
you
will
find
,
"
say
a
bystander
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
he
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
grievance
be
worth
more
to
him
than
his
money
.
"
  
<EOS>
no
bill
do
come
to
Frank
,
and
he
get
his
mount
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
MacFarlane
be
apply
to
,
he
declare
that
no
letter
order
a
horse
have
be
deliver
in
his
establishment
.
<EOS>
from
that
day
to
this
Mr.
Nappie
's
grey
horse
have
have
a
great
character
in
Ayrshire
;
but
all
the
world
there
say
that
its
owner
never
ride
him
as
Frank
Greystock
ride
him
that
day
.
     
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
take
an
Unfair
advantage
 
<EOS>
We
must
return
to
the
unfortunate
Lucinda
,
whom
we
last
see
struggle
with
her
steed
in
the
black
water
of
the
brook
which
she
attempt
to
jump
.
<EOS>
a
couple
of
man
be
soon
in
after
her
,
and
she
be
rescue
and
bring
back
to
the
side
from
which
she
have
take
off
without
any
great
difficulty
.
<EOS>
She
be
neither
hurt
nor
frightened
,
but
she
be
wet
through
;
and
for
a
while
she
be
very
unhappy
,
because
it
be
not
find
quite
easy
to
extricate
her
horse
.
<EOS>
during
the
ten
minute
of
her
agony
,
while
the
poor
brute
be
flounder
in
the
mud
,
she
have
be
quite
disregardful
of
herself
,
and
have
almost
seem
to
think
that
Sir
Griffin
,
who
be
with
her
,
should
go
into
the
water
after
her
steed
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
already
two
man
in
the
water
,
and
three
on
the
bank
,
and
Sir
Griffin
think
that
duty
require
him
to
stay
by
the
young
lady
's
side
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
a
bit
about
myself
,
"
say
Lucinda
,
"
but
if
anything
can
be
do
for
poor
Warrior
!
"
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
assure
her
that
"
poor
warrior
"
be
receive
the
very
good
attention
;
and
then
he
press
upon
her
the
dangerous
condition
in
which
she
herself
be
stand
,
 
quite
wet
through
,
cover
,
as
to
her
foot
and
leg
,
with
mud
,
grow
cold
and
colder
every
minute
.
<EOS>
She
touch
her
lip
with
a
little
brandy
that
somebody
give
her
,
and
then
declare
again
that
she
care
for
nothing
but
poor
Warrior
.
<EOS>
at
last
poor
Warrior
be
on
his
leg
,
with
the
water
drip
from
his
black
flank
,
with
his
nose
stain
with
mud
,
with
one
of
his
leg
a
little
cut
,
 
and
,
alas
!
<EOS>
with
the
saddle
wet
through
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
better
than
to
ride
into
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
the
whole
party
must
return
to
Kilmarnock
,
and
,
perhaps
,
if
they
hurry
,
she
may
be
able
to
get
her
clothe
dry
before
they
would
start
by
the
train
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
,
of
course
,
accompany
her
,
and
they
two
ride
into
the
town
alone
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
do
hear
of
the
accident
soon
after
the
occurrence
,
but
have
not
see
her
niece
;
nor
when
she
hear
of
it
,
could
she
have
join
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
if
anything
would
make
a
girl
talk
to
a
man
,
such
a
ducking
as
Lucinda
have
have
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
such
sudden
event
,
when
they
come
in
the
shape
of
misfortune
,
or
the
reverse
,
generally
have
the
effect
of
abolish
shyness
for
the
time
.
<EOS>
let
a
girl
be
upset
with
you
in
a
railway
train
,
and
she
will
talk
like
a
Rosalind
,
though
before
the
accident
she
be
as
mute
as
death
.
<EOS>
but
with
Lucinda
Roanoke
the
accustomed
change
do
not
seem
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
when
Sir
Griffin
have
place
her
on
her
saddle
,
she
would
have
trot
all
the
way
into
Kilmarnock
without
a
word
if
he
would
have
allow
her
.
<EOS>
but
he
,
at
least
,
understand
that
such
a
joint
misfortune
should
create
confidence
,
 
for
he
,
too
,
have
lose
the
run
,
and
he
do
not
intend
to
lose
his
opportunity
also
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
that
I
be
near
you
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
thank
you
,
yes
;
it
would
have
be
bad
to
be
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
be
glad
that
it
be
I
,
"
say
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
hard
even
to
get
a
moment
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
now
trot
along
on
the
road
,
and
there
be
still
three
mile
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
always
with
the
other
people
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
so
.
"
and
then
he
pause
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
want
to
find
you
when
you
be
not
with
the
other
people
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
however
,
you
do
not
like
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
he
pause
for
a
reply
,
she
feel
herself
bind
to
say
something
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
,
I
do
,
"
she
say
,
 
"
as
well
as
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
that
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
he
ride
on
for
the
good
part
of
another
mile
before
he
speak
to
her
again
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
know
why
it
be
that
he
want
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
determine
that
he
be
desirous
of
the
charm
or
comfort
of
domestic
life
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
even
think
where
he
would
live
be
he
married
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
suggest
to
himself
that
Lucinda
be
a
desirable
companion
,
that
her
temper
would
suit
his
,
that
her
way
and
his
be
sympathetic
,
or
that
she
would
be
a
good
mother
to
the
future
Sir
Griffin
Trewett
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
that
she
be
a
very
handsome
girl
,
and
therefore
he
have
think
that
he
would
like
to
possess
her
.
<EOS>
have
she
fall
like
a
ripe
plum
into
his
mouth
,
or
show
herself
ready
so
to
fall
,
he
would
probably
have
close
his
lip
and
back
out
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
but
the
difficulty
no
doubt
add
something
to
the
desire
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
hope
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
after
know
each
other
so
long
there
may
have
be
more
than
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
again
drive
to
speak
because
he
pause
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
that
make
much
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Roanoke
,
you
can
not
but
understand
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
do
not
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
speak
plainer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
now
,
Sir
Griffin
,
because
I
be
so
wet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
listen
to
me
even
if
you
will
not
answer
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
that
you
know
that
I
love
you
better
than
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
Will
you
be
mine
?
"
<EOS>
then
he
move
on
a
little
forward
so
that
he
may
look
back
into
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
to
think
of
you
as
my
future
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Roanoke
be
able
to
ride
at
a
stone
wall
or
at
a
river
,
and
to
ride
at
either
the
second
time
when
her
horse
balk
the
first
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
big
enough
for
that
.
<EOS>
but
her
heart
be
not
big
enough
to
enable
her
to
give
Sir
Griffin
an
answer
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
that
,
in
regard
to
the
river
and
the
stone
wall
,
she
know
what
she
want
;
but
that
,
as
to
Sir
Griffin
,
she
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
this
be
a
proper
time
to
ask
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
be
wet
through
and
cold
.
<EOS>
It
be
take
an
unfair
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
take
any
unfair
advantage
,
"
say
Sir
Griffin
scowling
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
be
alone
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Sir
Griffin
,
I
be
so
tired
!
"
<EOS>
as
they
be
now
enter
Kilmarnock
,
it
be
quite
clear
he
could
press
her
no
further
.
<EOS>
They
clatter
up
,
therefore
,
to
the
hotel
,
and
he
busy
himself
in
get
a
bedroom
fire
light
,
and
in
obtain
the
service
of
the
landlady
.
<EOS>
a
cup
of
tea
be
order
,
and
toast
,
and
in
two
minute
Lucinda
Roanoke
be
relieve
from
the
presence
of
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
kind
of
thing
a
fellow
do
not
quite
understand
,
"
say
Sir
Griffin
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
she
mean
it
,
and
why
the
devil
can
not
she
say
so
?
"
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
of
give
up
the
chase
,
but
he
think
that
perhaps
he
would
take
it
out
of
her
when
she
become
Lady
Tewett
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
an
hour
at
the
inn
before
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lady
Eustace
arrive
,
and
during
that
hour
Sir
Griffin
do
not
see
Miss
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
for
this
there
be
,
of
course
,
ample
reason
.
<EOS>
under
the
custody
of
the
landlady
,
Miss
Roanoke
be
be
make
dry
and
clean
,
and
be
by
no
mean
in
a
condition
to
receive
a
lover
's
vow
.
<EOS>
the
baronet
send
up
half
-
a
-
dozen
message
as
he
saunter
about
the
yard
of
the
inn
,
but
he
get
no
message
in
return
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
,
as
she
sit
drink
her
tea
and
dry
her
clothe
,
do
no
doubt
think
about
him
,
 
<EOS>
but
she
think
about
him
as
little
as
she
could
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
he
would
come
again
,
and
she
could
make
up
her
mind
then
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
doubt
necessary
that
she
should
do
something
.
<EOS>
Her
fortune
,
such
as
it
be
,
would
soon
be
spend
in
the
adventure
of
find
a
husband
.
<EOS>
She
also
have
her
idea
about
love
,
and
have
enough
of
sincerity
about
her
to
love
a
man
thoroughly
;
but
it
have
seem
to
her
that
all
the
man
who
come
near
her
be
man
whom
she
could
not
fail
to
dislike
.
<EOS>
She
be
hurry
here
and
hurry
there
,
and
know
nothing
of
real
social
intimacy
.
<EOS>
as
she
tell
her
aunt
in
her
wickedness
,
she
would
almost
have
prefer
a
shoemaker
,
 
if
she
could
have
become
acquaint
with
a
shoemaker
in
a
manner
that
should
be
unforced
and
genuine
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
savageness
of
antipathy
in
her
to
the
mode
of
life
which
her
circumstance
have
produce
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
very
savageness
which
make
her
ride
so
hard
,
and
which
forbid
her
to
smile
and
be
pleasant
to
people
whom
she
could
not
like
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
know
that
something
must
be
do
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
afford
to
wait
as
other
girl
may
do
.
<EOS>
why
not
Sir
Griffin
as
well
as
any
other
fool
?
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubt
whether
she
know
how
obstinate
,
how
hard
,
how
cruel
to
a
woman
a
fool
can
be
.
  
<EOS>
Her
stocking
have
be
wash
and
dry
,
and
her
boot
and
trouser
be
nearly
dry
,
when
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
follow
by
Lizzie
,
rush
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
darling
,
how
be
you
?
"
say
the
aunt
,
seize
her
niece
in
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
only
dirty
now
,
"
say
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
get
off
the
big
of
the
muck
,
my
lady
,
"
say
the
landlady
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Miss
Roanoke
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
"
I
hope
you
do
not
think
I
behave
badly
in
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
everybody
always
go
on
,
of
course
,
"
say
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
pray
Lord
George
to
let
me
try
and
jump
back
to
you

<EOS>
We
be
over
,
you
know
,
before
it
happen
.
<EOS>
but
he
say
it
be
quite
impossible
.
<EOS>
We
do
wait
till
we
see
you
be
out
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
It
do
not
signify
at
all
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
so
sorry
<EOS>
when
I
go
through
the
wall
at
the
corner
of
the
wood
before
you
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
excited
I
hardly
know
what
I
be
do
.
"
<EOS>
Lucinda
,
who
be
quite
use
to
these
affair
in
the
hunting
-
field
,
simply
nod
her
acceptance
of
this
apology
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
a
glorious
run
;
be
not
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
pretty
well
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
glorious
,
 
but
then
I
get
over
the
river
.
<EOS>
and
oh
,
if
you
have
be
there
afterwards
.
<EOS>
there
be
such
an
adventure
between
a
man
in
a
gig
and
my
cousin
Frank
.
"
<EOS>
then
they
all
go
to
the
train
,
and
be
carry
home
to
Portray
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
angry
?
"
 
<EOS>
on
their
journey
back
to
Portray
,
the
lady
be
almost
too
tired
for
talk
;
and
Sir
Griffin
be
sulky
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
have
as
yet
hear
nothing
about
Greystock
's
adventure
,
and
do
not
care
to
be
tell
.
<EOS>
but
when
once
they
be
at
the
castle
,
and
have
take
warm
bath
,
and
glass
of
sherry
,
and
get
themselves
dress
and
have
come
down
to
dinner
,
they
be
all
very
happy
.
<EOS>
to
Lizzie
it
have
certainly
be
the
most
triumphant
day
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Her
marriage
with
Sir
Florian
have
be
triumphant
,
but
that
be
only
a
step
to
something
good
that
be
to
come
after
.
<EOS>
She
then
have
at
her
own
disposal
her
little
wit
and
her
prettiness
,
and
a
world
before
her
<EOS>
in
which
,
as
it
then
seem
to
her
,
there
be
a
deal
of
pleasure
if
she
could
only
reach
it
.
<EOS>
up
to
this
period
of
her
career
she
have
hardly
reach
any
pleasure
;
but
this
day
have
be
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
have
in
truth
be
her
Corsair
,
and
she
have
find
the
thing
which
she
like
to
do
,
and
would
soon
know
how
to
do
.
<EOS>
how
glorious
it
be
to
jump
over
that
black
,
yawn
stream
,
and
then
to
see
Lucinda
fall
into
it
!
<EOS>
and
she
could
remember
every
jump
,
and
her
feeling
of
ecstasy
as
she
land
on
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
by
heart
every
kind
word
that
Lord
George
have
say
to
her
,
 
<EOS>
and
she
love
the
sweet
,
pleasant
,
Corsair
-
like
intimacy
that
have
spring
up
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
wonder
whether
Frank
be
at
all
jealous
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
amiss
that
he
should
be
a
little
jealous
.
<EOS>
and
then
somebody
have
bring
home
in
his
pocket
the
fox
's
brush
,
which
the
master
of
the
hound
have
tell
the
huntsman
to
give
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
delightful
;
 
and
so
much
more
delightful
because
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
not
go
quite
so
well
as
she
like
to
go
,
and
because
Lucinda
have
fall
into
the
water
.
  
<EOS>
They
do
not
dine
till
past
eight
,
and
the
lady
and
gentleman
all
leave
the
room
together
.
<EOS>
coffee
and
liqueur
be
to
be
bring
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
they
be
all
to
be
intimate
,
comfortable
,
and
at
their
ease
;
 
all
except
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
who
be
still
very
sulky
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
he
say
anything
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
ask
.
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
<EOS>
"
He
propose
;
but
of
course
I
could
not
answer
him
when
I
be
wet
through
.
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
but
a
moment
,
and
in
that
moment
this
be
all
that
Lucinda
would
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
I
do
not
mean
to
stir
again
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
throw
herself
into
a
corner
of
a
sofa
,
"
till
somebody
carry
me
to
bed
.
<EOS>
I
never
be
so
tired
in
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
tired
,
but
there
be
a
fatigue
which
be
delightful
as
long
as
all
the
surrounding
be
pleasant
and
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
call
it
a
very
hard
day
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
only
kill
one
fox
,
"
say
Mr.
Emilius
,
pretend
a
delightfully
clerical
ignorance
,
"
and
on
Monday
you
kill
four
.
<EOS>
why
should
you
be
tired
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
nearly
twenty
mile
,
"
say
Frank
,
who
be
also
ignorant
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
ten
,
perhaps
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
hour
and
forty
minute
,
and
there
be
a
good
bit
of
slow
hunting
after
we
have
come
back
over
the
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
it
be
thirty
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
forget
her
fatigue
in
her
energy
.
  
<EOS>
"
ten
be
always
well
than
twenty
,
"
say
Lord
George
,
"
and
five
generally
well
than
ten
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
whatever
be
good
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
Frank
's
friend
,
Mr.
Nappie
,
say
it
be
twenty
.
<EOS>
by
-
the
-
bye
,
Frank
,
ought
not
we
to
have
ask
Mr.
Nappie
home
to
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
"
say
Frank
;
"
but
I
could
not
take
the
liberty
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
poor
Mr.
Nappie
be
very
badly
use
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
be
,
"
say
Lord
George
;
 
"
no
man
ever
bad
since
hunting
be
invent
.
<EOS>
He
be
entitle
to
a
dozen
dinner
and
no
end
of
patronage
;
but
you
see
he
take
it
out
in
call
your
cousin
Mr.
Greystockings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
that
blow
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
always
call
you
Cousin
Greystockings
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
hard
,
"
continue
Lord
George
,
"
and
I
understand
it
all
so
well
when
he
get
into
a
mess
in
his
wrath
about
book
the
horse
to
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
if
the
horse
have
be
on
the
roadside
,
he
or
his
man
could
have
protect
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
put
under
the
protection
of
a
whole
railway
company
,
and
the
company
give
him
up
to
the
first
fellow
that
come
and
ask
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
cruel
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
have
happen
to
me
,
I
should
have
be
very
angry
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
Frank
would
not
have
have
a
horse
at
all
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
"
unless
he
have
take
Mr.
Nappie
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
still
continue
his
plea
for
Mr.
Nappie
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
in
that
,
certainly
;
but
,
still
,
I
agree
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
happen
to
me
,
I
should
 
just
have
commit
murder
and
suicide
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
anything
so
terrible
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
for
your
noble
master
to
talk
of
be
civil
,
and
hope
that
the
horse
have
carry
him
well
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
there
be
circumstance
in
which
a
man
can
not
be
civil
.
<EOS>
and
then
everybody
laugh
at
him
!
<EOS>
It
be
the
way
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
the
lower
you
fall
,
the
more
you
be
kick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
I
do
for
him
?
"
ask
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
put
him
down
at
your
club
,
and
order
thirty
dozen
of
grey
shirting
from
Nappie
and
Co.
,
without
name
the
price
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
send
you
grey
stocking
instead
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
Lizzie
be
in
heaven
,
it
behove
her
to
be
careful
.
<EOS>
the
Corsair
be
a
very
fine
speciman
of
the
Corsair
breed
;
 
about
the
good
Corsair
she
have
ever
see
,
and
have
be
devote
to
her
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
but
these
corsair
be
know
to
be
dangerous
,
and
it
would
not
be
wise
that
she
should
sacrifice
any
future
prospect
of
importance
on
behalf
of
a
feeling
,
which
,
no
doubt
,
be
found
on
poetry
,
but
which
may
too
probably
have
no
possible
beneficial
result
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
she
know
,
the
Corsair
have
not
even
an
island
of
his
own
in
the
Ægean
Sea
.
<EOS>
and
,
if
he
have
,
may
not
the
island
too
probably
have
a
Medora
or
two
of
its
own
?
<EOS>
in
a
ride
across
the
country
the
Corsair
be
all
that
a
Corsair
should
be
;
but
know
,
as
she
do
,
but
very
little
of
the
Corsair
,
she
could
not
afford
to
throw
over
her
cousin
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
as
she
be
leave
the
drawing
-
room
,
she
manage
to
say
one
word
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
angry
with
me
because
I
get
Lord
George
to
ride
with
me
instead
of
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
angry
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
should
only
be
a
hindrance
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
He
know
all
about
it
,
and
I
know
nothing

I
be
very
glad
that
you
like
it
so
much

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
like
it
;

so
do
you

I
be
so
glad
you
get
that
poor
man
's
horse

<EOS>
You
be
not
angry
then
?
<EOS>
"
They
have
now
pass
across
the
hall
,
and
be
on
the
bottom
stair

<EOS>
"
certainly
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

you
be
not

for
what
happen
before
?
<EOS>
"
She
do
not
look
into
his
face
as
she
ask
this
question
,
but
stand
with
her
eye
fix
on
the
stair
-
carpet
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
no

"
  
"
good
night
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
night

then
she
go
,
and
he
return
to
a
room
below
which
have
be
prepare
for
purpose
of
tobacco
and
soda
-
water
and
brandy

<EOS>
"
why
,
Griff
,
you
be
rather
out
of
sort
to
-
night
,
"
say
Lord
George
to
his
friend
,
before
Frank
have
join
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
would
you
be
out
of
sort
if
you
would
lose
your
run
and
have
to
pick
a
young
woman
out
of
the
water

<EOS>
I
do
not
like
young
woman
when
they
be
damp

smell
of
mud

<EOS>
"
You
mean

to
ask
you
question

do
you
mean

,
if
you
do

what
will
Mrs.

?
<EOS>

if
you

what
do

do

all
the
rest

it

<EOS>
"
as
for
marry
the
widow

I
should
like
to
know
the
fact
first

<EOS>
as
to
Mrs.
C.
,
she
would
not
object
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
generally
have
my
horse
so
bitted
that
they
can
not
very
well
object

<EOS>
and
as
to
the
other
question
,
I
mean
to
stay
here
for
the
next
fortnight
,
and
I
advise
you
to
make
it
square
with
Miss
Roanoke

here
be
my
lady

cousin

often

he
go
very
well
to

day

I
wonder
if
he
would
take
a
twenty

pound
note
if
I
send
it
to
him
,

Frank
,
when
they
break
up
for
the
night

I
do
not
like
the
idea
of
ride
such
a
fellow

horse
for
nothing

<EOS>
"
He
will
bring
an
action
against

then
you
can
offer
to
pay
if
you
like

<EOS>
Mr.
Nappie
do
bring
an
action
against
the
railway
,
claim
exorbitant
damage
;
 
but
with
what
result
,
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
to
inquire
.
   
<EOS>
"
likewise
the
Bears
in
Couples
agree
"
 
Frank
Greystock
stay
till
the
follow
Monday
at
Portray
,
but
could
not
be
induce
to
hunt
on
the
Saturday
,
 
on
which
day
the
other
sport
man
and
woman
go
to
the
meet
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
he
say
,
trust
to
that
traitor
MacFarlane
,
and
he
fear
that
his
friend
Mr.
Nappie
would
not
give
him
another
mount
on
the
grey
horse
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
offer
him
one
of
her
two
darling

an
offer
which
he
,
of
course
,
refuse
;

Lord
George
also
propose
to
put
him
up
.
<EOS>
but
Frank
aver
that
he
have
ride
his
hunt
for
that
season
,

would
not
jeopardise
the
laurel
he
have
gain

,
moreover

he
,
"
I
should
not
dare

meet
Mr.

field

so
he
remain
at
the
castle

take
a
walk
with
Mr.

ask
a
good

further

down

,
as
very
little
information
have
be
give
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
joke
throughout
the
castle
that
Mr.
Emilius
have
fall
in
love
with
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
a
great
deal
together
on
those
hunting
day
;
and
Miss
Macnulty
be
unusually
enthusiastic
in
praise
of
his
manner
and
conversation
.
<EOS>
to
her
,
also
,
have
be
address
question
as
to
Portray
and
its
income
,
all
of
which
she
have
answer
to
the
good
of
her
ability
;
 
not
intend
to
betray
any
secret

to
betray
;
but
give
ordinary
information
on
that
commonest
of
all
subject
,
our
friend
"
income
.
<EOS>
then
there
have
rise
a
question
whether
there
be
a
vacancy
for
such
promotion
to
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
certainly
hear
that
there
be
a
Mrs.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
be
sure
that
there
be
not
,
 
an
assurance
which
may
have
be
derive
from
a
certain
eagerness
in
the
reverend
gentleman
's
demeanour
to
herself
on
a
former
occasion
.
<EOS>
to
Lizzie
,
who
at
present
be
very
good

natured
,
the
idea
of
Miss
Macnulty
have
a
lover
,
whether
he
be
a
married
man
or
not
,
be
very
delightful
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
what
you
mean
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
Mr.
Emilius
have
any
idea
of
the
kind
.
"
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
however
,
Miss
Macnulty
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Saturday

<EOS>
Mr.
Nappie
be
out
on
his
grey
horse
,
and
condescend
to
a
little
conversation
with
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
mind
,
he
say
,
if
Mr.
Greystock
have
come
forward
;
but
he
do
think
Mr.
Greystock

not
come
forward
as
he
ought
to
have
do
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
profess
that
he
have

then
,
as

of
laughter

<EOS>
there
have
be
nothing
special
in
the
way
of
sport
,
and
Lizzie
's
enthusiasm
for
hunting
,
though
still
high
,
have
go
down
a
few
degree
below
fever
heat
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
have
again

there

Aunt
Jane

I
hope
it
will
make
you
comfortable

<EOS>
I
hate
a
good
many
people
;
but
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
<EOS>
I
hate
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
the
bad

Nonsense

It
shall
be
nonsense

it

true

shall
have

there
shall
be
no
lying

you

much
you
may
wish
it

<EOS>
I
hate
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
grim
,
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
quite
understand
that
to
person
situate
in
great
difficulty
thing
may
be
grim
.
<EOS>
a
certain
amount
of
grimness
must
be
endure
.
<EOS>
and
she
know
,
too
,
that
Lucinda
be
not
a
girl
to
be
drive
without
show
something
of
an
intractable
spirit
in
harness
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
undertake
the
driving
of
Lucinda
,
and
have
be
not
altogether
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
the
thing
so
necessary
to
be
do
be
now
effect
.
<EOS>
Her
niece
be
engage
to
a
man
with
a
title
,
to
a
man
report
to
have
a
fortune
,
to
a
man
of
family
,
and
a
man
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
now
that
the
engagement
be
make
,
the
girl
could
not
go
back
from
it
,
and
it
be
for
Mrs.
Carbuncle
to
see
that
neither
should
Sir
Griffin
go
back
.
<EOS>
Her
first
step
must
be
take
at
once
.
<EOS>
the
engagement
should
be
make
known
to
all
the
party
,
and
should
be
recognise
by
some
word
speak
between
herself
and
the
lover
.
<EOS>
the
word
between
herself
and
the
lover
must
be
the
first
thing
.
<EOS>
She
herself
,
personally
,
be
not
very
fond
of
Sir
Griffin
;
but
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
she
could
smile
and
endure
the
bear
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
be
a
bear
,
 
but
so
also
be
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
rabbit
and
hare
all
go
in
pair
;
and
likewise
the
bear
in
couple
agree
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
console
herself
with
the
song
,
and
assure
herself
that
it
would
all
come
right
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
the
she
-
bear
be
not
as
civil
to
the
he
-
bear
as
the
turtle
dove
be
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
perhaps
,
her
misfortune
that
her
niece
be
not
a
turtle
dove
;
but
,
such
as
she
be
,
the
good
have
be
do
for
her
.
"
<EOS>
dear
Sir
Griffin
,
"
she
say
on
the
first
available
opportunity
,
not
care
much
for
the
crowd
,
and
almost
desirous
that
her
very
word
should
be
overhear
,
"
my
darling
girl
have
make
me
so
happy
by
what
she
have
tell
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
not
lose
any
time
,
"
say
Sir
Griffin

<EOS>
"
of
course
she
would
lose
no
time

<EOS>
She
be
the
same
to
me
as
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
child
of
my
own

and
she
be
everything
to
me
.
<EOS>
May
I
tell
you
that
you
be
the
lucky
man
in
Europe
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
every
girl
that
would
suit
me
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
notice
how
particular
you
be
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
a
word
of
Lucinda
's
beauty
.
<EOS>
man
be
well
judge
of
that
than
woman
;
but
for
high
,
chivalrous
spirit
,
for
true
principle
and
nobility
,
and
what
I
call
downright
worth
,
I
do
not
think
you
will
easily
find
her
superior
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
as
true
as
steel
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
about
as
hard
,
I
be
begin
to
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
girl
like
that
,
Sir
Griffin
,
do
not
give
herself
away
easily
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
like
her
the
less
for
that
now
that
you
be
the
possessor
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
young
,
and
have
know
my
wish
that
she
should
not
engage
herself
to
any
one
quite
yet
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
it
be
,
I
can
not
regret
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
not
,
"
say
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
that
the
man
be
a
bear
<EOS>
be
a
matter
of
course
,
and
bear
probably
do
not
themselves
know
how
bearish
they
be
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
,
no
doubt
,
be
unaware
of
the
extent
of
his
own
rudeness
.
<EOS>
and
his
rudeness
matter
but
little
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
so
long
as
he
acknowledge
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
expect
a
lover
's
rapture
from
the
one
more
than
from
the
other
.
<EOS>
and
be
not
there
enough
in
the
engagement
to
satisfy
her
?
<EOS>
She
allow
,
therefore
,
no
cloud
to
cross
her
brow
as
she
ride
up
alongside
of
Lord
George
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
have
propose
,
and
she
have
accept
him
,
"
she
say
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
now
desirous
that
any
one
should
hear
her
but
he
to
whom
she
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
she
have
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
about
that
,
George
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
she
would
,
and
sometimes
that
she
would
not
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
understand
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Griff
will
understand
her
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
and
now
that
the
thing
be
settle
,
you
will
not
trouble
me
about
it
any
more
.
<EOS>
Their
woe
be
on
their
own
head
.
<EOS>
if
they
come
to
blow
Lucinda
will
thrash
him
,
I
do
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
while
it
be
simply
a
matter
of
temper
and
word
,
she
will
not
find
Tewett
so
easy
-
go
as
he
look

<EOS>

I
believe
they
will
do
very
well
together

perhaps
they
will
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
saying
who
may
do
well
together

<EOS>
You
and
Carbuncle
get
on

when

it
to

"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
nothing
be
settle
yet

<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
be
too
hard
about
settlement

,
maybe
,
he
will
find
a
way
of
wriggle
out

<EOS>
when
a
girl
without
a
shilling
ask
very
much
,
the
world
support
a
man
for
break
his
engagement
.
<EOS>
let
her
pretend
to
be
indifferent
about
it

that
will
be
the
way
to
keep
him
firm

<EOS>

what
be
his
income

George
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
an
idea

there
never

close
man
about
money

I
believe
he
must
have
the
bulk
of
the
Tewett
property
some
day

He
can
not

above
a

twelve

so

suppose

in
debt

not
much

I
think

He
make
stupid
bet

the
devil

not

him
of
it

better

on

I
know
that
from

not

quite
public

just
to

turn
round
with

flash

anger
at
the

her
head

<EOS>
this
happen
after
the
party
have
separate
for
the
evening

<EOS>
at
dinner
Sir
Griffin
have
,
of
course
,
give
Lucinda
his
arm

so
he
have
always
do
since
they
have
be
at
Portray

<EOS>
Lucinda
hardly
open
her
mouth
at
table

have
retreat
to
bed
with
a
headache

the
man
,
who
on
that
day
linger
a
few
minute
after
the
lady
,
go
into
the
drawing
-
room

<EOS>
this
Sir
Griffin
feel
to
be
almost
an
affront

as
there
be
a
certain
process
of
farewell
for
the
night
which
he
have
anticipate
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
go
to
treat
him
like
that

he
would
cut
up
rough

They

know
to

<EOS>
Lucinda
,
when
she
have
hear
of
the
arrangement
,
have
protest
to
her
aunt
that
she
would
not
go
down
-
stair
till
they
have
all
return
;
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
fear
the
anger
of
Sir
Griffin
,
doubt
whether
,
in
his
anger
,
he
may
not
escape
them
altogether
,
say
a
word
or
two
which
even
Lucinda
find
to
be
rational
.
<EOS>
"
as
you
have
accept
him
,
you
should
not
avoid
him
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
that
be
only
make
thing
bad
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
and
then
it
be
cowardly
,
be
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
no
word
that
could
have
be
speak
be
more
likely
to
be
efficacious
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
she
would
not
be
cowardly
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
then
as
the
wheel
of
the
carriage
be
no
longer
hear
grate
upon
the
road
,
Lucinda
,
who
have
be
very
careful
in
her
dress
,
 
so
careful
as
to
avoid
all
appearance
of
care
,
 
with
slow
majestic
step
descend
to
a
drawing
-
room
which
they
be
accustomed
to
use
on
morning
.
<EOS>
It
be
probable
that
Sir
Griffin
be
smoke
somewhere
about
the
ground
,
but
it
could
not
be
her
duty
to
go
after
him
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
She
would
remain
there
,
and
,
if
he
choose
,
he
may
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
ground
of
complaint
on
his
side
if
she
allow
herself
to
be
find
in
one
of
the
ordinary
sitting
-
room
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
in
about
half
an
hour
he
saunter
upon
the
terrace
,
and
flatten
his
nose
against
the
window
.
<EOS>
She
bow
and
smile
to
him
,
 
hate
herself
for
smile
.
<EOS>
It
be
perhaps
the
first
time
that
she
have
endeavour
to
put
on
a
pleasant
face
wherewithal
to
greet
him
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
then
,
but
pass
round
the
house
,
throw
away
the
end
of
his
cigar
,
and
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
whatever
happen
,
she
would
not
be
a
coward
.
<EOS>
the
thing
have
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
see
that
she
have
accept
him
on
the
previous
day
,
have
not
run
away
in
the
night
or
take
poison
,
and
have
come
down
to
undergo
the
interview
,
she
would
undergo
it
at
least
with
courage
.
<EOS>
what
do
it
matter
,
even
though
he
should
embrace
her
?
<EOS>
It
be
her
lot
to
undergo
misery
,
and
as
she
have
not
choose
to
take
poison
,
the
misery
must
be
endure
.
<EOS>
She
rise
as
he
enter
and
give
him
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
have
think
what
she
would
do
,
and
be
collect
and
dignified
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
,
and
be
very
awkward
.
"
<EOS>
so
you
have
not
go
to
church
,
Sir
Griffin
,
 
as
you
ought
,
"
she
say
,
with
another
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
;
I
have
go
as
much
as
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
a
headache
.
<EOS>
You
stay
away
to
smoke
cigar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
stay
to
see
you
,
my
girl
.
<EOS>
"
a
lover
may
call
his
lady
love
his
girl
,
and
do
so
very
prettily
.
<EOS>
He
may
so
use
the
word
that
she
will
like
it
,
and
be
grateful
in
her
heart
for
the
sweetness
of
the
sound
.
<EOS>
but
Sir
Griffin
do
not
do
it
nicely
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
ever
so
much
to
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
flatter
you
by
say
that
I
stay
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
;
 
do
not
you
now
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
,
but
there
be
something
almost
of
playfulness
in
her
manner
of
do
it
.
"
<EOS>
ah
,
but
I
know
you
do
.
<EOS>
and
why
should
not
you
speak
out
,
now
that
we
be
to
be
man
and
wife
?
<EOS>
I
like
a
girl
to
speak
out
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
if
I
want
to
be
with
you
,
you
want
as
much
to
be
with
me
;
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
that
that
follow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
 
---
,
if
it
do
not
,
I
will
be
off
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
please
yourself
about
that
,
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
;
do
you
love
me
?
<EOS>
You
have
never
say
you
love
me
.
"
<EOS>
luckily
perhaps
for
her
he
think
that
the
good
assurance
of
love
be
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
revolt
,
or
attempt
to
struggle
with
him
;
but
the
hot
blood
fly
over
her
entire
face
,
and
her
lip
be
very
cold
to
his
,
and
she
almost
tremble
in
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
be
not
a
man
who
could
ever
have
be
the
adore
of
many
woman
,
but
the
instinct
of
his
kind
be
strong
enough
within
him
to
make
him
feel
that
she
do
not
return
his
embrace
with
passion
.
<EOS>
He
have
find
her
to
be
very
beautiful
;
 
but
it
seem
to
him
that
she
have
never
be
so
little
beautiful
as
when
thus
press
close
to
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
"
he
say
,
still
hold
her
;
"
you
will
give
me
a
kiss
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
do
it
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
nothing
like
it
.
<EOS>
oh
,
if
you
will
not
,
you
know
 
"
  
on
a
sudden
she
make
up
her
mind
,
and
absolutely
do
kiss
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
sooner
have
leap
at
the
black
,
dark
,
dirtiest
river
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
she
say
,
"
that
will
do
,
"
gently
extricate
herself
from
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
some
girl
be
different
,
I
know
;
but
you
must
take
me
as
I
be
,
Sir
Griffin
;
 
that
is
,
if
you
do
take
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
can
not
you
drop
the
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
;
 
I
can
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
do
love
me
?
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
pause
,
while
she
try
to
swallow
the
lie
.
<EOS>
"
come
;
 
I
be
not
go
to
marry
any
girl
who
be
ashamed
to
say
that
she
love
me
.
<EOS>
I
like
a
little
flesh
and
blood
.
<EOS>
You
do
love
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
the
lie
be
tell
;
and
for
the
moment
he
have
to
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
but
in
his
heart
he
do
not
believe
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
for
her
to
say
that
she
be
not
like
other
girl
.
<EOS>
why
should
not
she
be
like
other
girl
?
<EOS>
It
may
,
no
doubt
,
suit
her
to
be
make
Lady
Tewett
;
 
but
he
would
not
make
her
Lady
Tewett
if
she
give
herself
air
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
should
lie
on
his
breast
and
swear
that
she
love
him
beyond
all
the
world
;
 
or
else
<EOS>
she
should
never
be
Lady
Tewett
.
<EOS>
different
from
other
girl
indeed
!
<EOS>
She
should
know
that
he
be
different
from
other
man
.
<EOS>
then
he
ask
her
to
come
and
take
a
walk
about
the
ground
.
<EOS>
to
that
she
make
no
objection
.
<EOS>
She
would
get
her
hat
and
be
with
him
in
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
absent
more
than
ten
minute
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
alone
<EOS>
she
stand
before
her
glass
look
at
herself
,
and
then
she
burst
into
tear
.
<EOS>
never
before
have
she
be
thus
pollute
.
<EOS>
the
embrace
have
disgust
her
.
<EOS>
It
make
her
odious
to
herself
.
<EOS>
and
if
this
,
the
beginning
of
it
,
be
so
bad
,
how
be
she
to
drink
the
cup
to
the
bitter
dreg
?
<EOS>
other
girl
,
she
know
,
be
fond
of
their
lover
,
 
<EOS>
some
so
fond
of
them
that
all
moment
of
absence
be
moment
,
if
not
of
pain
,
at
any
rate
of
regret
.
<EOS>
to
her
,
as
she
stand
there
ready
to
tear
herself
because
of
the
vileness
of
her
own
condition
,
it
now
seem
as
though
no
such
love
as
that
be
possible
to
her
.
<EOS>
for
the
sake
of
this
man
who
be
to
be
her
husband
,
she
hate
all
man
.
<EOS>
be
not
everything
around
her
base
,
and
mean
,
and
sordid
?
<EOS>
She
have
understand
thoroughly
the
quick
divulging
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
tiding
,
the
working
of
her
aunt
's
anxious
mind
.
<EOS>
the
man
,
now
that
he
have
be
catch
,
be
not
to
be
allow
to
escape
.
<EOS>
but
how
great
would
be
the
boon
if
he
would
escape
.
<EOS>
how
should
she
escape
?
<EOS>
and
yet
she
know
that
she
mean
to
go
on
and
bear
it
all
.
<EOS>
perhaps
by
study
and
due
practice
she
may
become
,
 
as
be
some
other
,
 
a
beast
of
prey
,
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
the
feeling
that
have
make
these
few
minute
so
inexpressibly
loathsome
to
her
might
,
perhaps
,
be
drive
from
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
wash
the
tear
from
her
eye
with
savage
energy
and
descend
to
her
lover
with
a
veil
fasten
closely
under
her
hat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
not
keep
you
wait
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
woman
always
do
,
"
he
reply
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
It
give
them
importance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
so
with
me
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
be
agitate
,
 
and
I
cry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
ay
;
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
He
rather
like
the
idea
of
have
reduce
the
haughty
Lucinda
to
tear
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
need
not
have
be
ashamed
of
my
see
it
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
can
see
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
that
off
presently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
now
,
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
what
a
name
it
be
!
<EOS>
It
seem
to
blister
her
tongue
as
she
use
it
without
the
usual
prefix
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
you
tie
up
in
that
way
before

<EOS>
You
do
not
do
it
out
hunt
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
you
when
the
snow
have
be
drive
in
your
face
,
and
you
do
not
mind
it
,
 
not
so
much
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
surprised
that
I
should
be
agitate
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
happy
;
 
be
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
the
lie
once
tell
must
of
course
be
continue
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
I
do
not
quite
understand
you
,
"
say
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
look
here
,
Lucinda
;
if
you
want
to
back
out
of
it
,
you
can
,
you
know
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
ask
me
again
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
say
with
the
old
savage
voice
,
and
it
at
once
reduce
Sir
Griffin
to
thraldom
.
<EOS>
to
be
reject
now
would
be
the
death
of
him
.
<EOS>
and
should
there
come
a
quarrel
he
be
sure
that
it
would
seem
to
be
that
he
have
be
reject
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
all
right
,
"
he
say
;
"
only
when
a
man
be
only
think
how
he
can
make
you
happy
,
he
do
not
like
to
find
nothing
but
cry
.
"
<EOS>
after
this
there
be
but
little
more
say
between
them
before
they
return
to
the
castle
.
   
<EOS>
life
at
Portray
 
<EOS>
on
the
Monday
Frank
take
his
departure

<EOS>
everybody
at
the
castle
have
like
him
except
Sir
Griffin
,
who
,
when
he
have
go
,
remark
to
Lucinda
that
he
be
an
insufferable
legal
prig
,
and
one
of
those
chap
who
think
themselves
somebody
because
they
be
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
have
like
Frank
,
and
say
so
very
boldly
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
what
it
be
,
"
reply
Sir
Griffin
;
"
you
always
like
the
people
I
do
not

"
when
he
be
go
,
Lizzie
leave
her
hand
in
his
for
a
moment
,
and
give
one
look
up
into
his
eye
.

"
<EOS>
when
be
Lucy
to
be
make
blessed
?

"
she
ask
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
Lucy
will
ever
be
make
bless

"
he
reply
,
"
but
I
be
sure
I
hope
she
will
.
"
<EOS>
not
a
word
more
be
say
,
and
he
return
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lucinda
remain
at
Portray
Castle
till
after
Christmas
,
greatly
overstay
the
original
time
fix
for
their
visit
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
go
and
return
,
and
go
again
and
return
again
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
hunting
and
a
great
many
love
passage
,
which
need
not
be
record
here
.
<EOS>
more
than
once
during
these
six
or
seven
week
there
arise
a
quarrel
,
bitter
,
loud
,
and
pronounce
,
between
Sir
Griffin
and
Lucinda
;
but
Lord
George
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
between
them
manage
to
throw
oil
upon
the
water
,
and
when
Christmas
come
the
engagement
be
still
an
engagement
.
<EOS>
the
absolute
suggestion
that
it
should
be
break
,
and
abandon
,
and
throw
to
the
wind
,
always
come
from
Lucinda
;
and
Sir
Griffin
,
when
he
find
that
Lucinda
be
in
earnest
,
would
again
be
move
by
his
old
desire
,
and
would
determine
that
he
would
have
the
thing
he
want
.
<EOS>
once
he
behave
with
such
coarse
brutality
that
nothing
but
an
abject
apology
would
serve
the
turn
.
<EOS>
He
make
the
abject
apology
,
and
after
that
become
conscious
that
his
wing
be
clip
,
and
that
he
must
do
as
he
be
bidden
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
take
him
away
,
and
bring
him
back
again
,
and
blow
him
up
;
 
and
at
last
,
under
pressure
from
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
make
him
consent
to
the
fixing
of
a
day
.
<EOS>
the
marriage
be
to
take
place
during
the
first
week
in
April
.
<EOS>
when
the
party
move
from
Portray
,
he
be
to
go
up
to
London
and
see
his
lawyer
.
<EOS>
settlement
be
to
be
arrange
,
and
something
be
to
be
fix
as
to
future
residence
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
this
Lucinda
be
passive
as
regard
the
making
of
the
arrangement
,
but
very
troublesome
to
those
around
her
as
to
her
immediate
mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
even
to
Lady
Eustace
<EOS>
she
be
curt
and
uncivil
.
<EOS>
to
her
aunt
she
be
at
time
ferocious
.
<EOS>
She
tell
Lord
George
more
than
once
to
his
face
that
he
be
hurry
her
to
perdition
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
the
d
 
---
be
it
you
want
?
"
<EOS>
Lord
George
say
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
not
to
be
married
to
this
man
.
"
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
accept
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
you
to
take
him
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
want
to
go
into
a
workhouse
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
then
she
ride
so
hard
that
all
the
Ayrshire
laird
be
startle
out
of
their
propriety
,
and
there
be
a
general
fear
that
she
would
meet
some
terrible
accident
.
<EOS>
and
Lizzie
,
instigate
by
jealousy
,
learn
to
ride
as
hard
,
and
as
they
ride
against
each
other
every
day
,
there
be
a
turmoil
in
the
hunt
.
<EOS>
Morgan
,
scratch
his
head
,
declare
that
he
have
know
"
drunken
rampage
man
,
"
but
have
never
see
lady
so
wicked
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
do
come
down
rather
badly
at
one
wall
,
and
Lucinda
get
herself
jam
against
a
gate
-
post
.
<EOS>
but
when
Christmas
be
come
and
go
,
and
Portray
Castle
have
be
leave
empty
,
no
very
bad
accident
have
occur
.
  
<EOS>
a
great
friendship
have
spring
up
between
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lizzie
,
so
that
both
have
become
very
communicative
.
<EOS>
whether
both
or
either
have
be
candid
may
,
perhaps
,
be
doubt
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
be
quite
confidential
in
discuss
with
her
friend
the
dangerous
variety
of
Lucinda
's
humours
,
and
the
dreadful
aversion
which
she
still
seem
to
entertain
for
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
but
then
these
humour
and
this
aversion
be
so
visible
,
that
they
could
not
well
be
conceal
;
 
and
what
can
be
the
use
of
confidential
communication
if
thing
be
keep
back
which
the
confidante
would
see
even
if
they
be
not
tell
?
<EOS>
"
She
would
be
just
like
that
whoever
the
man
be
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
wonder
at
such
a
phenomenon
in
female
nature
.
<EOS>
but
,
with
this
fact
understand
between
them
to
be
a
fact
,
 
namely
,
that
Lucinda
would
be
sure
to
hate
any
man
whom
she
may
accept
,
 
they
both
agree
that
the
marriage
have
better
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
must
take
a
husband
,
some
day
,
you
know
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
with
her
good
look
,
it
would
be
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
not
be
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
quite
out
of
the
question
,
"
repeat
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
really
do
not
see
how
she
be
to
do
better
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
nature
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
enough
of
it
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
and
at
the
pension
,
near
Paris
,
they
could
not
break
her
in
at
all
.
<EOS>
nobody
ever
could
break
her
in
.
<EOS>
You
see
it
in
the
way
she
ride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Sir
Griffin
must
do
it
,
"
say
Lizzie
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
that
,
or
the
other
thing
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
no
doubt
about
this
;
 
whoever
may
break
or
be
break
,
the
marriage
must
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
not
persevere
with
one
like
her
,
Lady
Eustace
,
nothing
can
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
quite
concur
.
<EOS>
what
do
it
matter
to
her
who
should
break
,
or
who
be
break
,
if
she
could
only
sail
her
own
little
bark
without
dash
it
on
the
rock
?
<EOS>
rock
there
be
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
quite
know
what
to
make
of
Lord
George
,
who
certainly
be
a
Corsair
,
 
who
have
say
some
very
pretty
thing
to
her
,
quite
à
la
Corsair
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
meantime
,
from
certain
rumour
that
she
hear
,
she
believe
that
Frank
have
give
up
,
or
at
least
be
intend
to
give
up
,
the
little
chit
who
be
live
with
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
something
of
a
quarrel
,
 
so
,
at
least
,
she
have
hear
through
Miss
Macnulty
,
with
whom
Lady
Linlithgow
still
occasionally
correspond
in
spite
of
their
former
breach
.
<EOS>
from
Frank
,
Lizzie
hear
repeatedly
,
but
Frank
in
his
letter
never
mention
the
name
of
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
now
,
if
there
should
be
a
division
between
Frank
and
Lucy
,
then
,
she
think
,
Frank
would
return
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
if
so
,
for
a
permanent
hold
rock
of
protection
in
the
world
,
her
cousin
Frank
would
be
at
any
rate
safe
than
the
Corsair
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
quite
come
to
understand
each
other
comfortably
about
money
.
<EOS>
It
suit
Mrs.
Carbuncle
very
well
to
remain
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
longer
necessary
that
she
should
carry
Lucinda
about
in
search
of
game
to
be
run
down
.
<EOS>
the
one
head
of
game
need
have
be
run
down
,
such
as
it
be
,
 
not
,
indeed
,
a
very
noble
stag
;
but
the
stag
have
be
accept
;
and
a
home
for
herself
and
her
niece
,
which
should
have
about
it
a
sufficient
air
of
fashion
to
satisfy
public
opinion
,
 
out
of
London
,
 
better
still
,
in
Scotland
,
belong
to
a
person
with
a
title
,
enjoy
the
appurtenance
of
wealth
,
and
one
to
which
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
could
have
access
,
 
be
very
desirable
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
out
of
the
question
that
Lady
Eustace
should
bear
all
the
expense
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
undertake
to
find
the
stable
,
and
do
pay
for
that
rick
of
hay
and
for
the
cart
-
load
of
forage
which
have
make
Lizzie
's
heart
quake
as
she
see
it
drag
up
the
hill
towards
her
own
granary
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
comfortable
when
all
these
thing
be
clearly
understand
.
<EOS>
early
in
January
they
be
all
to
go
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
then
for
a
while
,
 
up
to
the
period
of
Lucinda
's
marriage
,
 
Lizzie
be
to
be
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
guest
at
the
small
house
in
Mayfair
;
 
but
Lizzie
be
to
keep
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
there
come
at
last
to
be
some
little
attempt
,
perhaps
,
at
a
hard
bargain
at
the
hand
of
each
lady
,
in
which
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
as
the
elder
,
probably
get
the
advantage
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
question
about
the
livery
in
London
.
<EOS>
the
footman
there
must
appertain
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
whereas
the
coachman
would
as
necessarily
be
one
of
Lizzie
's
retainer
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
assent
at
last
to
find
the
double
livery
,
 
but
,
like
a
prudent
woman
,
arrange
to
get
her
quid
pro
quo
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
add
something
,
you
know
,
to
the
present
you
will
have
to
give
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
shall
choose
something
up
to
forty
pound
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
will
say
thirty
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
who
be
begin
to
know
the
value
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
split
the
difference
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
with
a
pleasant
little
burst
of
laughter
,
 
and
the
difference
be
split
.
<EOS>
that
the
very
neat
and
even
dandified
appearance
of
the
groom
who
ride
out
hunt
with
them
should
be
provide
at
the
expense
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
quite
understand
;
but
it
be
equally
well
understand
that
Lizzie
be
to
provide
the
horse
on
which
he
ride
,
on
every
third
day
.
<EOS>
It
add
greatly
to
the
comfort
of
friend
live
together
when
these
thing
be
accurately
settle
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
remain
longer
than
have
be
anticipate
,
and
do
not
go
till
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
take
their
departure
.
<EOS>
It
be
observe
that
he
never
speak
of
his
wife
;
and
yet
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
almost
sure
that
she
have
hear
of
such
a
lady
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
himself
very
agreeable
,
and
be
,
either
by
art
or
nature
,
a
courteous
man
,
 
one
who
pay
compliment
to
lady
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
however
,
that
he
sometimes
startle
his
hearer
by
thing
which
may
have
be
consider
to
border
on
coarseness
if
they
have
not
be
say
by
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
an
idea
that
he
intend
to
marry
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
and
Miss
Macnulty
certainly
receive
his
attention
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
in
these
circumstance
his
prolonged
stay
at
the
castle
be
not
question
;
 
but
when
towards
the
end
of
November
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
take
their
departure
,
he
be
oblige
to
return
to
his
flock
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
great
subject
of
the
diamond
Lizzie
have
speak
her
mind
freely
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
early
in
the
day
of
their
friendship
,
 
immediately
,
that
is
,
after
the
bargaining
have
be
complete
.
<EOS>
"
ten
thousand
pound
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculate
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
open
wide
her
eye
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
nod
her
head
thrice
,
in
token
of
reiterated
assurance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
mean
that
you
really
know
their
value
?
<EOS>
"
the
lady
at
this
time
be
closet
together
,
and
be
discuss
many
thing
in
the
close
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
value
for
me
by
jeweller
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ten
thousand
pound
!
<EOS>
and
Sir
Florian
give
them
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
put
them
round
my
neck
,
and
tell
me
they
be
to
be
mine
,
 
always
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
generous
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
if
you
have
but
know
him
!
"
say
Lizzie
,
just
touch
her
eye
with
her
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
people
claim
them
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
bit
surprised
at
that
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
think
a
man
could
not
give
away
so
much
as
that
,
 
not
just
as
one
make
a
present
that
cost
forty
or
fifty
pound
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
of
show
that
she
do
not
think
so
very
much
of
that
come
thirty
-
five
-
pound
"
gift
"
for
which
the
bargain
have
be
make
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
they
say
.
<EOS>
and
they
say
ever
so
many
other
thing
besides
.
<EOS>
They
mean
to
prove
that
it
be
an
 
heirloom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
not
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
Frank
,
who
know
more
about
law
than
any
other
man
in
London
,
say
that
they
can
not
make
a
necklace
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
a
brooch
or
a
ring
it
would
be
different
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
understand
it
,
but
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
Sir
Florian
do
not
say
something
about
it
in
his
will
,
"
suggest
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
do
;
 
at
least
,
not
just
about
the
necklace
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lady
Eustace
explain
the
nature
of
her
late
husband
's
will
,
as
far
as
it
regard
chattel
to
be
find
in
the
Castle
of
Portray
at
the
time
of
his
death
;
and
add
the
fiction
,
which
have
now
become
common
to
her
,
as
to
the
necklace
have
be
give
to
her
in
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
let
them
have
it
,
"

Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
,
"

Lizzie

<EOS>
"
I
should
 
sell
them
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
there
be
so
many
accident
.
<EOS>
a
woman
should
be
very
rich
indeed
before
she
allow
herself
to
walk
about
with
ten
thousand
pound
upon
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
suppose
somebody
break
into
the
house
and
steal
them

<EOS>
and
if
they
be
sell
,
my
dear
,
so
that
some
get
to
Paris
,
and
other
to
St.
Petersburg
,
and
other
to
New
York
,
they
would
have
to
give
it
up
then
.
<EOS>
"
before
the
discussion
be
over
,
Lizzie
trip
up
-
stair
and
bring
the
necklace
down
,
and
put
it
on
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
neck
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
like
to
have
such
property
in
my
house
,
my
dear

continue
Mrs.
Carbuncle

<EOS>
"
of
course

very
nice

nothing

so
nice

and
if
a
person

a
proper
place
to
keep
them

all
that

"
I
have
a
very
strong
iron
case

Lizzie

they
should
be
at
the
bank

at
the
jeweller

somewhere
quite

safe

People
may
steal
the

all

<EOS>
if
I

I
should

"
It
be
explain
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
on
that
occasion
that
Lizzie
have
bring
them
down
with
her
in
the
train
from
London
,
and
that
she
intend

back

"
there
be
nothing
the
thief
would
find
easy

way

Mrs.

.
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
day
after
this
that
there
come
down
to
her
by
post
some
terribly
frightful
document
,
which
be
the
first
result
,
as
far
as
she
be
concern

of
the
filing
of
a
bill
in
Chancery

which
hostile
proceeding
be

in
truth

effect
by
the
unaided
energy

put
himself
forward
simply
as
an
instrument
use
by
the
trustee

within
eight
day

<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
in
his
letter
explain
that
the
service
of
this
document
upon
her
in
Scotland
would
amount
to
nothing
,
 
<EOS>
even
be
he
to
send
it
down
by
a
messenger
;
but
that
,
no
doubt
,
she
would
send
it
to
her
attorney
,
who
would
see
the
expedience
of
avoid
exposure
by
accept
the
service
.
<EOS>
of
all
which
explanation
Lizzie
do
not
understand
one
word
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Camperdowns
"
letter
and
the
document
which
it
contain
do
frighten
her
considerably
,
although
the
matter
have
be
discuss
so
often
that
she
have
accustom
herself
to
declare
that
no
such
bugbear
as
that
should
have
any
influence
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
ask
Frank
whether
,
in
the
event
of
such
missile
reach
her
,
she
may
send
them
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
her
that
they
should
be
at
once
place
in
the
hand
of
her
attorney
;
 
and
consequently
she
now
send
them
to
Messrs.
Mowbray
and
Mopus
,
with
a
very
short
note
from
herself
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
present
her
compliment
to
Messrs.
Mowbray
and
Mopus
,
and
enclose
some
paper
she
have
receive
about
her
diamond

<EOS>
They
be
her
own
diamond
,
give
to
her
by
her
late
husband
.
<EOS>
please
do
what
be
proper
,
but
Mr.
Camperdown
ought
to
be
make
to
pay
all
the
expense
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
,
no
doubt
,
allow
herself
to
hope
that
no
further
step
would
be
take
in
the
matter
;
and
the
very
name
of
the
Vice
-
Chancellor
do
for
a
few
hour
<EOS>
chill
the
blood
at
her
heart
.
<EOS>
in
those
few
hour
she
almost
long
to
throw
the
necklace
into
the
sea
,
feel
sure
that
,
if
the
diamond
be
absolutely
lose
,
there
must
be
altogether
an
end
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
but
,
by
degree
,
her
courage
return
to
her
,
as
she
remember
that
her
cousin
have
tell
her
that
,
as
far
as
he
could
see
,
the
necklace
be
legally
her
own
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
have
,
of
course
,
be
deceive
by
the
lie
which
she
have
repeat
to
him
;
but
lie
which
have
be
efficacious
with
him
may
be
efficacious
with
other
.
<EOS>
who
could
prove
that
Sir
Florian
have
not
take
the
diamond
to
Scotland
,
and
give
them
to
her
there
,
in
that
very
house
which
be
now
her
own
?
  
<EOS>
She
tell
Mrs.
Carbuncle
of
the
missile
which
have
be
hurl
at
her
from
the
London
court
of
law
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
evidently
think
that
the
diamond
be
as
good
as
go
.
"
<EOS>
then
I
suppose
you
can
not
sell
them
?
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
could
;
 
I
could
sell
them
to

morrow
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
hinder
me
?
<EOS>
suppose
I
take
them
to
jeweller
in
Paris
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
jeweller
would
think
you
have
steal
them

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
steal
them
,
"
say
Lizzie
;
<EOS>
"
they
be
my
very
own

<EOS>
Frank
say
that
nobody
can
take
them
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
why
should
not
a
man
give
his
wife
a
diamond
necklace
as
well
as
a
diamond
ring
?
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
can
not
understand

<EOS>
what
may
he
give
her
so
that
man
sha'n't
come
and
worry
her
life
out
of
her
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
as
for
an
heirloom
,
anybody
who
know
anything
,
know
that
it
can
not
be
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
a
pot
or
a
pan
may
be
an
heirloom
;
 
but
a
diamond
necklace
can
not
be
an
heirloom
.
<EOS>
everybody
know
that
,
that
know
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
it
will
all
come
right
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
who
do
not
in
the
least
believe
Lizzie
's
law
about
the
pot
and
pan
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
week
in
January
Lord
George
and
Sir
Griffin
return
to
the
castle
with
the
view
of
travel
up
to
London
with
the
three
lady
.
<EOS>
this
arrangement
be
partly
throw
over
by
circumstance
,
as
Sir
Griffin
be
pleased
to
leave
Portray
two
day
before
the
other
and
to
travel
by
himself
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
bitter
quarrel
between
Lucinda
and
her
lover
,
and
it
be
understand
afterwards
by
Lady
Eustace
that
Sir
Griffin
have
have
a
few
word
with
Lord
George
;
 
but
what
those
few
word
be
,
she
never
quite
know
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
open
rupture
between
the
two
gentleman
,
but
Sir
Griffin
show
his
displeasure
to
the
lady
,
who
be
more
likely
to
bear
patiently
his
ill
-
humour
in
the
present
circumstance
than
be
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
when
a
man
have
show
himself
to
be
so
far
amenable
to
feminine
authority
as
to
have
put
himself
in
the
way
of
matrimony
,
lady
will
bear
a
great
deal
from
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
which
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
not
endure
from
Sir
Griffin
,
 
just
at
present
;
and
,
on
behalf
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
even
Lizzie
be
long
-
suffer
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
,
however
,
be
say
that
this
Petruchio
have
as
yet
tame
his
own
peculiar
shrew
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
be
as
savage
as
ever
,
and
would
snap
and
snarl
,
and
almost
bite
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
would
snarl
too
,
and
say
very
bearish
thing
.
<EOS>
but
when
it
come
to
the
point
of
actual
quarrelling
,
he
would
become
sullen
,
and
in
his
sullenness
would
yield
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

carruther

it
all

and
he
leave

night

Kilmarnock

<EOS>
the
day
,
however
,
be
pass
in

though
he

nothing

three
lady

it
be
understand
by

as
they
return
to
Portray
that
there

<EOS>
Lord

Lord

take
upon

to

<EOS>
on
the
morning
but
one
follow
,
there
come
a
note
from
Sir

to
Lucinda
,
 
just
as
they
be
leave
home
for
their
journey
up
to
London
,
 
in
which
Sir
Griffin
express
his
regret
if
he
have
say
anything
displease
to
Mrs.

.
   
<EOS>
a
Midnight
Adventure
 
<EOS>
something
as
to
the
jewel
have
be
tell
to
Lord
George
;
 
and
this
be
quite
necessary
,
as
Lord
George
intend
to
travel
with
the
lady
from
Portray
to
London
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
he
have
hear
of
the
diamond
,
 
as
who
have
not
?
<EOS>
He
have
hear
too
of
Lord
Fawn
,
and
know
why
it
be
that
Lord
Fawn
have
peremptorily
refuse
to
carry
out
his
engagement
.
<EOS>
but
,
till
he
be
tell
by
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
he
do
not
know
that
the
diamond
be
then
keep
within
the
castle
,
nor
do
he
understand
that
it
would
be
part
of
his
duty
to
guard
them
on
their
way
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
worth
ever
so
much
;
be
not
they
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
when
she
first
give
him
the
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
ten
thousand
pound
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
almost
with
awe
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
say
that
they
have
be
value
at
that
,
since
she
be
have
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
own
to
himself
that
such
a
necklace
be
worth
have
,
 
as
also
,
no
doubt
,
be
Portray
Castle
and
the
income
arise
from
the
estate
,
even
though
they
could
be
hold
in
possession
only
for
a
single
life
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
in
his
very
chequered
career
he
have
escape
the
trammel
of
matrimony
,
and
among
his
many
mode
of
life
have
hardly
even
suggest
to
himself
the
expediency
of
take
a
wife
with
a
fortune
,
and
then
settle
down
for
the
future
,
if
submissively
,
still
comfortably
.
<EOS>
to
say
that
he
have
never
look
forward
to
such
a
marriage
as
a
possible
future
arrangement
would
probably
be
incorrect
.
<EOS>
to
man
such
as
Lord
George
it
be
too
easy
a
result
of
a
career
to
be
altogether
banish
from
the
mind
.
<EOS>
but
no
attempt
have
ever
yet
be
make
,
nor
have
any
special
lady
ever
be
so
far
honour
in
his
thought
as
to
be
connect
in
them
with
any
vague
idea
which
he
may
have
form
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
but
now
it
do
occur
to
him
that
Portray
Castle
be
a
place
in
which
he
could
pass
two
or
three
month
annually
without
ennui
;
and
that
if
he
be
to
marry
,
little
Lizzie
Eustace
would
do
as
well
as
any
other
woman
with
money
whom
he
may
chance
to
meet
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
say
all
this
to
anybody
,
and
therefore
can
not
be
accuse
of
vanity
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
speak
on
such
a
subject
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
and
as
our
Lizzie
certainly
bestow
upon
him
many
of
her
smile
,
much
of
her
poetry
,
and
some
of
her
confidence
,
it
can
not
be
say
that
he
be
not
justify
in
his
view
.
<EOS>
but
then
she
be
such
"
an
infernal
little
liar
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
George
be
quite
able
to
discover
so
much
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
do
lie
,
certainly
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
but
then
who
do
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
their
departure
the
box
with
the
diamond
be
bring
down
into
the
hall
just
as
they
be
about
to
depart
.
<EOS>
the
tall
London
footman
again
bring
it
down
,
and
deposit
it
on
one
of
the
oak
hall
-
chair
,
as
though
it
be
a
thing
so
heavy
that
he
could
hardly
stagger
along
with
it
.
<EOS>
how
Lizzie
do
hate
the
man
as
she
watch
him
,
and
regret
that
she
have
not
attempt
to
carry
it
down
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
with
her
diamond
that
morning
,
and
have
see
them
out
of
the
box
and
into
it
.
<EOS>
few
day
pass
on
which
she
do
not
handle
them
and
gaze
at
them
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
suggest
that
the
box
,
with
all
her
diamond
in
it
,
may
be
steal
from
her
,
 
and
as
she
think
of
this
her
heart
almost
sink
within
her
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
them
once
again
in
London
she
would
take
some
step
to
relieve
herself
from
this
embarrassment
of
carry
about
with
her
so
great
a
burthen
of
care
.
<EOS>
the
man
,
with
a
vehement
show
of
exertion
,
deposit
the
box
on
a
chair
,
and
then
groan
aloud
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
know
very
well
that
she
could
lift
the
box
by
her
own
unaided
exertion
,
and
that
the
groan
be
at
any
rate
unnecessary
.
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
somebody
be
to
steal
that
on
the
way
,
"
say
Lord
George
to
her
,
not
in
his
pleasantest
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
suggest
anything
so
horrible
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
try
to
laugh

<EOS>
"
I
should
not
like
it
at
all

Lord
George

I

it

me
a

about
it
all
.
<EOS>
there
never
be
such
a
persecution
.
<EOS>
I
often
say
that
I
should
be
well
pleased
to
take
the
bauble
and
fle
it
into
the
ocean
wave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
be
a
mermaid
and
catch
it
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
better
would
you
be
?
<EOS>
such
thing
be
all
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
hate
the
shine
thing
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
hit
the
box
with
the
whip
she
hold
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
arrange
that
the
party
should
sleep
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
It
consist
of
Lord
George
,
the
three
lady
,
the
tall
man
servant
,
Lord
George
's
own
man
,
and
the
two
maid
.
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
,
with
the
heir
and
the
nurse
,
be
to
remain
at
Portray
for
yet
a
while
longer
.
<EOS>
the
iron
box
be
again
put
into
the
carriage
,
and
be
use
by
Lizzie
as
a
footstool
.
<EOS>
this
may
have
be
very
well
,
have
there
be
no
necessity
for
change
their
train
.
<EOS>
at
Troon
the
porter
behave
well
,
and
do
not
struggle
much
as
he
carry
it
from
the
carriage
on
to
the
platform
.
<EOS>
but
at
Kilmarnock
,
where
they
meet
the
train
from
Glasgow
,
the
big
footman
interfere
again
,
and
the
scene
be
perform
under
the
eye
of
a
crowd
of
people
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
Lizzie
that
Lord
George
almost
encourage
the
struggling
,
as
though
he
be
in
league
with
the
footman
to
annoy
her
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
further
change
between
Kilmarnock
and
Carlisle
,
and
they
manage
to
make
themselves
very
comfortable
.
<EOS>
lunch
have
be
provide
;
 
for
Mrs.
Carbuncle
<EOS>
be
a
woman
who
care
for
such
thing
,
and
Lord
George
also
like
a
glass
of
champagne
in
the
middle
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
profess
to
be
perfectly
indifferent
on
such
matter
;
but
nevertheless
she
enjoy
her
lunch
,
and
allow
Lord
George
to
press
upon
her
a
second
,
and
perhaps
a
portion
of
a
third
glass
of
wine
.
<EOS>
even
Lucinda
be
rouse
up
from
her
general
state
of
apathy
,
and
permit
herself
to
forget
Sir
Griffin
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
during
this
journey
to
Carlisle
Lizzie
Eustace
almost
make
up
her
mind
that
Lord
George
be
the
very
Corsair
she
have
be
expect
ever
since
she
have
master
Lord
Byron
's
great
poem
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
way
of
do
thing
and
of
say
thing
,
of
proclaim
himself
to
be
master
,
and
at
the
same
time
of
make
himself
thoroughly
agreeable
to
his
dependant
,
 
and
especially
to
the
one
dependant
whom
he
most
honour
at
the
time
,
 
which
exactly
suit
Lizzie
's
idea
of
what
a
man
should
be
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
possess
that
utter
indifference
to
all
convention
and
law
,
which
be
the
great
prerogative
of
Corsairs
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
reverence
for
aught
divine
or
human
,
 
which
be
a
great
thing
.
<EOS>
the
Queen
and
Parliament
,
the
bench
of
bishop
,
and
even
the
police
,
be
to
him
just
so
many
fungus
and
parasite
,
and
noxious
vapour
,
and
false
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
name
by
which
he
venture
to
call
these
bugbear
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
delightful
to
live
with
a
man
who
himself
have
a
title
of
his
own
,
but
who
could
speak
of
duke
and
marquise
as
be
quite
despicable
by
reason
of
their
absurd
position
.
<EOS>
and
as
they
become
gay
and
free
after
their
luncheon
he
express
almost
as
much
contempt
for
honesty
as
for
duke
,
and
show
clearly
that
he
regard
matrimony
and
marquise
to
be
equally
vain
and
useless
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
dare
you
say
such
thing
in
our
hearing
!
"
exclaim
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
assert
that
if
man
and
woman
be
really
true
,
no
vow
would
be
need
;
 
and
if
no
vow
,
then
no
marriage
vow
.
<EOS>
do
you
believe
such
vow
be
keep
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
enthusiastically
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
"
say
Lucinda
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nor
I
,
"
say
the
Corsair
.
<EOS>
"
who
can
believe
that
a
woman
will
always
love
her
husband
because
she
swear
she
will
?
<EOS>
the
oath
be
false
on
the
face
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
woman
must
marry
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
the
Corsair
declare
freely
that
he
do
not
see
any
such
necessity
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
though
it
could
hardly
be
say
that
this
Corsair
be
a
handsome
man
,
still
he
have
fine
Corsair
's
eye
,
full
of
expression
and
determination
,
eye
that
could
look
love
and
bloodshe
almost
at
the
same
time
;
and
then
he
have
those
manly
property
,
 
power
,
bigness
,
and
apparent
boldness
,
 
which
belong
to
a
Corsair
.
<EOS>
to
be
hurry
about
the
world
by
such
a
man
,
treat
sometimes
with
crush
severity
,
and
at
other
with
the
tender
love
,
not
to
be
speak
to
for
one
fortnight
,
and
then
to
be
embrace
perpetually
for
another
,
to
be
cast
every
now
and
then
into
some
abyss
of
despair
by
his
rashness
,
and
then
raise
to
a
pinnacle
of
human
joy
by
his
courage
,
 
that
,
think
Lizzie
,
would
be
the
kind
of
life
which
would
suit
her
poetical
temperament
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
how
would
it
be
with
her
,
if
the
Corsair
be
to
take
to
hurry
about
the
world
without
carry
her
with
him
;
 
and
be
to
do
so
always
at
her
expense
!
<EOS>
perhaps
he
may
hurry
about
the
world
and
take
somebody
else
with
him
.
<EOS>
Medora
,
if
Lizzie
remember
rightly
,
have
have
no
jointure
or
private
fortune
.
<EOS>
but
yet
a
woman
must
risk
something
if
the
spirit
of
poetry
be
to
be
allow
any
play
at
all
!
"
<EOS>
and
now
these
weary
diamond
again
,
"
say
Lord
George
,
as
the
carriage
be
stop
against
the
Carlisle
platform
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
must
go
into
your
bedroom
,
Lady
Eustace
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
let
the
man
put
the
box
in
yours
;
 
just
for
this
night
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
not
if
I
know
it
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
explain
.
<EOS>
such
property
would
be
quite
as
liable
to
be
steal
when
in
his
custody
as
it
would
in
her
;
 
but
if
steal
while
in
his
would
entail
upon
him
a
grievous
vexation
which
would
by
no
means
lessen
the
effect
of
her
loss
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
understand
him
,
but
find
that
he
be
quite
in
earnest
<EOS>
she
direct
that
the
box
should
be
again
take
to
her
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
suggest
that
it
should
be
entrust
to
the
landlord
;
and
for
a
moment
or
two
Lizzie
submit
to
the
idea
.
<EOS>
but
she
stand
for
that
moment
thinking
of
it
,
and
then
decide
that
the
box
should
go
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
knowing
what
that
Mr.
Camperdown
might
not
do
,
"
she
whisper
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
the
porter
and
the
tall
footman
,
between
them
,
stagger
along
under
their
load
,
and
the
iron
box
be
again
deposit
in
the
bedroom
of
the
Carlisle
inn
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
at
Carlisle
be
spend
very
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
the
lady
agree
that
they
would
not
dress
,
 
but
of
course
they
do
so
with
more
or
less
of
care
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
make
herself
to
look
very
pretty
,
though
the
skirt
of
the
gown
in
which
she
come
down
be
that
which
she
have
wear
during
the
journey
.
<EOS>
point
this
out
with
much
triumph
,
she
accuse
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lucinda
of
great
treachery
,
in
that
they
have
not
adhere
to
any
vestige
of
their
travelling
raiment
.
<EOS>
but
the
rancour
be
not
vehement
,
and
the
evening
be
pass
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
be
infinitely
pet
by
the
three
Houris
around
him
,
and
Lizzie
call
him
a
Corsair
to
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
and
you
be
the
Medora
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
.
<EOS>
that
be
your
place
,
 
certainly
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
pity
Sir
Griffin
be
not
here
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
that
we
may
call
him
the
Giaour
.
"
<EOS>
Lucinda
shudder
,
without
any
attempt
at
conceal
her
shudder
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
,
Lucinda
,
but
I
think
Sir
Griffin
would
make
a
very
good
Giaour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
let
one
forget
it
all
just
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
Sir
Griffin
would
say
if
he
be
to
hear
this
!
"
say
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
late
in
the
evening
Lord
George
stroll
out
,
and
of
course
the
lady
discuss
his
character
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
declare
that
he
be
the
soul
of
honour
.
<EOS>
in
regard
to
her
own
feeling
for
him
,
she
aver
that
no
woman
have
ever
have
a
truer
friend
.
<EOS>
any
other
sentiment
be
of
course
out
of
the
question
,
 
for
be
she
not
a
married
woman
?
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
for
that
accident
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
really
think
that
she
could
have
give
her
heart
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
declare
that
she
always
regard
him
as
a
kind
of
supplementary
father
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
be
a
year
or
two
old
than
Sir
Griffin
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
why
should
you
make
me
unhappy
?
"
say
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
then
Mrs.
Carbuncle
explain
,
that
whereas
Sir
Griffin
be
not
yet
thirty
,
Lord
George
be
over
forty
.
<EOS>
"
all
I
can
say
be
,
he
do
not
look
it
,
"
urge
Lady
Eustace
enthusiastically
.
<EOS>
"
those
sort
of
man
never
do
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
when
he
return
,
be
greet
with
an
allusion
to
angel
"
wing
,
 
and
would
have
be
<EOS>
a
good
deal
spoil
among
them
be
it
in
the
nature
of
such
an
article
to
receive
injury
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
clock
have
strike
ten
the
lady
all
go
away
to
their
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
be
in
her
own
room
,
of
course
find
her
maid
wait
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessarily
part
of
the
religion
of
such
a
woman
as
Lizzie
Eustace
that
she
could
not
go
to
bed
,
or
change
her
clothe
,
or
get
up
in
the
morning
,
without
the
assistance
of
her
own
young
woman
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
like
to
have
it
think
that
she
could
stick
a
pin
into
her
own
belonging
without
such
assistance
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
it
be
often
the
case
with
her
,
that
she
be
anxious
to
get
rid
of
her
girl
's
attendance
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
so
on
this
morning
,
and
before
dinner
,
and
be
so
now
again
.
<EOS>
She
be
secret
in
her
movement
,
and
always
have
some
recess
in
her
box
and
bag
and
dress
apparatus
to
which
she
do
not
choose
that
Miss
Patience
Crabstick
should
have
access
.
<EOS>
She
be
careful
about
her
letter
,
and
very
careful
about
her
money
.
<EOS>
and
then
as
to
that
iron
box
in
which
the
diamond
be
keep
!
<EOS>
Patience
Crabstick
have
never
yet
see
the
inside
of
it
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
it
may
be
say
,
 
either
on
Lizzie
's
behalf
or
to
her
discredit
,
as
the
reader
may
be
pleased
to
take
it
,
 
that
she
be
quite
able
to
dress
herself
,
to
brush
her
own
hair
,
to
take
off
her
own
clothe
;
and
that
she
be
not
,
either
by
nature
or
education
,
an
incapable
young
woman
.
<EOS>
but
that
honour
and
glory
demand
it
,
she
would
almost
as
lief
have
have
no
Patience
Crabstick
to
pry
into
her
most
private
matter
.
<EOS>
all
which
Crabstick
know
,
and
would
often
declare
her
missus
to
be
"
of
all
missus
the
most
sly
and
least
<EOS>
come
-
at
-
able
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
on
this
present
night
she
be
very
soon
despatch
to
her
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
however
,
take
one
careful
look
at
the
iron
box
before
the
girl
be
send
away
.
  
<EOS>
Crabstick
,
on
this
occasion
,
have
not
far
to
go
to
seek
her
own
couch
.
<EOS>
alongside
of
Lizzie
's
large
chamber
there
be
a
small
room
,
 
a
dressing
-
room
with
a
bed
in
it
,
which
,
for
this
night
,
be
devoted
to
Crabstick
's
accommodation
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
she
depart
from
attendance
on
her
mistress
by
the
door
which
open
from
the
one
room
to
the
other
;
but
this
have
no
sooner
be
close
than
Crabstick
descend
to
complete
the
amusement
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
be
alone
,
bolt
both
the
door
on
the
inside
,
and
then
quickly
retire
to
rest
.
<EOS>
some
short
prayer
she
say
,
with
her
knee
close
to
the
iron
box
.
<EOS>
then
she
put
certain
article
of
property
under
her
pillow
,
 
her
watch
and
chain
,
and
the
ring
from
her
finger
,
and
a
packet
which
she
have
draw
from
her
travelling
-
desk
,
 
and
be
soon
in
bed
,
think
that
,
as
she
fall
away
to
sleep
,
she
would
revolve
in
her
mind
that
question
of
the
Corsair
;
 
<EOS>
would
it
be
good
to
trust
herself
and
all
her
belonging
to
one
who
may
perhaps
take
her
belonging
away
,
but
leave
herself
behind
?
<EOS>
the
subject
be
not
unpleasant
,
and
while
she
be
consider
it
,
she
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
perhaps
,
about
two
in
the
morning
when
a
man
,
very
efficient
at
the
trade
which
he
be
then
follow
,
kneel
outside
Lady
Eustace
's
door
,
and
,
with
a
delicately
-
make
saw
,
aid
,
probably
,
by
some
other
equally
well
-
finish
tool
,
absolutely
cut
out
that
portion
of
the
bedroom
door
on
which
the
bolt
be
fasten
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
know
the
spot
exactly
,
for
he
do
not
doubt
a
moment
as
he
commence
his
work
;
and
yet
there
be
nothing
on
the
exterior
of
the
door
to
show
where
the
bolt
be
place
.
<EOS>
the
bit
be
cut
out
without
the
slight
noise
,
and
then
,
when
the
door
be
open
,
be
place
,
just
inside
,
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
the
man
then
with
perfectly
noiseless
step
enter
the
room
,
knelt
again
,
 
just
where
poor
Lizzie
have
kneel
as
she
say
her
prayer
,
 
so
that
he
may
the
more
easily
raise
the
iron
box
without
a
struggle
,
and
leave
the
room
with
it
in
his
arm
without
disturb
the
lovely
sleeper
.
<EOS>
He
then
descend
the
stair
,
pass
into
the
coffee
-
room
at
the
bottom
of
them
,
and
hand
the
box
through
an
open
window
to
a
man
who
be
crouch
on
the
outside
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
He
then
follow
the
box
,
pull
down
the
window
,
put
on
a
pair
of
boot
which
his
friend
have
ready
for
him
;
and
the
two
,
after
linger
a
few
moment
in
the
shade
of
the
dark
wall
,
retreat
with
their
prize
round
a
corner
.
<EOS>
the
night
itself
be
almost
pitch
-
dark
,
and
very
wet
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
nearly
black
with
darkness
as
a
night
can
be
.
<EOS>
so
far
,
the
enterprise
adventurer
have
be
successful
,
and
we
will
now
leave
them
in
their
choose
retreat
,
engage
on
the
long
operation
of
force

safe
.
<EOS>
for
it
have
be
arrange
between
them
that
the
iron
safe
should
be
open
then
and
there
.
<EOS>
though
the
weight
to
him
who
have
take
it
out
of
Lizzie
's
room
have
not
be
oppressive
,
as
it
have
oppress
the
tall
serving

man
,
it
may
still
have
be
an
encumbrance
to
gentleman
intend
to
travel
by
railway
with
as
little
observation
as
possible
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
however
,
well
supply
with
tool
,
and
we
will
leave
them
at
their
work
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
Lizzie
be
awaken
earlier
than
she
have
expect
,
and
find
,
not
only
Patience
Crabstick
in
her
bedroom
,
but
also
a
chambermaid
,
and
the
wife
of
the

of
the
hotel

<EOS>
the
story

<EOS>
Her

and
her

<EOS>
the

at
their
leisure
,
and
proceed
to
London
by
a
train
leave
Carlisle
in
the
middle
of
the
day
;
but
they
be
soon
disturb
from
their
rest
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
have
hardly
time
to
get
her
slipper
on
her
foot
,
and
to
wrap
herself
in
her
dressing
-
gown
,
to
get
rid
of
her
dishevel
nightcap
,
and
make
herself
just
fit
for
public
view
,
before
the
manager
of
the
hotel
,
and
Lord
George
,
and
the
tall
footman
,
and
the
boot
be
in
her
bedroom
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
plainly
manifest
to
them
all
that
the
diamond
be
go
.
<EOS>
the
superintendent
of
the
Carlisle
police
be
there
almost
as
soon
as
the
other
;
 
and
follow
him
very
quickly
come
the
important
gentleman
who
be
the
head
of
the
constabulary
of
the
county
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
first
hear
the
news
,
be
awe
-
strike
,
rather
than
outwardly
demonstrative
of
grief
.
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
a
regular
plot
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
Captain
Fitzmaurice
,
the
gallant
chief
,
nod
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
plot
enough
,
"
say
the
superintendent
,
 
who
do
not
mean
to
confide
his
thought
to
any
man
,
or
to
exempt
any
human
being
from
his
suspicion
.
<EOS>
the
manager
of
the
hotel
be
very
angry
,
and
at
first
do
not
restrain
his
anger
.
<EOS>
do
not
everybody
know
that
if
article
of
value
be
bring
into
an
hotel
they
should
be
hand
over
to
the
safe
-
keeping
of
the
manager
?
<EOS>
He
almost
seem
to
think
that
Lizzie
have
steal
her
own
box
of
diamond
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
say
Lord
George
,
"
nobody
be
say
a
word
against
you
,
or
your
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
lord
;
 
but
 
"
  
"
Lady
Eustace
be
not
blame
you
,
and
do
not
you
blame
anybody
else
,
"
say
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
let
the
police
do
what
be
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
man
retreat
,
and
Lizzie
be
leave
with
Patience
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
but
even
then
she
do
not
give
way
to
her
grief
,
but
sit
upon
the
bed
awe
-
strike
and
mute
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
have
better
get
dress
,
"
she
say
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
how
it
may
be
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
hold
Lizzie
's
hand
affectionately
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
you
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
prize
be
so
great
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
be
a
-
tell
my
lady
 
"
begin
Crabstick
.
  
<EOS>
"
hold
your
tongue
!
"
say
Lizzie
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
police
will
do
the
good
they
can
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
;
 
and
so
will
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
will
lie
down
again
for
a
little
while
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
so
sick
I
hardly
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
lie
down
for
a
little
I
should
be
well
.
"
<EOS>
with
much
difficulty
she
get
them
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
then
,
before
she
again
undress
herself
,
she
bolt
the
door
that
still
have
a
bolt
,
and
turn
the
lock
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
have
do
this
,
she
take
out
from
under
her
pillow
the
little
parcel
which
have
be
in
her
desk
,
 
and
,
untie
it
,
perceive
that
her
dear
diamond
necklace
be
perfect
,
and
quite
safe
.
  
<EOS>
the
enterprise
adventurer
have
,
indeed
,
steal
the
iron
case
,
but
they
have
steal
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
the
reader
must
not
suppose
that
because
Lizzie
have
preserve
her
jewel
,
she
be
therefore
a
consent
party
to
the
abstraction
of
the
box
.
<EOS>
the
theft
have
be
a
genuine
theft
,
plan
with
great
skill
,
carry
out
with
much
ingenuity
,
one
in
the
perpetration
of
which
money
have
be
spend
,
 
a
theft
which
for
a
while
baffle
the
police
of
England
,
and
which
be
suppose
to
be
very
creditable
to
those
who
have
be
engage
in
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
box
,
and
nothing
but
the
box
,
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
thief
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
silence
when
the
abstraction
of
the
box
be
make
known
to
her
,
 
her
silence
as
to
the
fact
that
the
necklace
be
at
that
moment
within
the
grasp
of
her
own
finger
<EOS>
,
 
be
not
at
first
the
effect
of
deliberate
fraud
.
<EOS>
She
be
ashamed
to
tell
them
that
she
bring
the
box
empty
from
Portray
,
have
the
diamond
in
her
own
keeping
because
she
have
fear
that
the
box
may
be
steal
.
<EOS>
and
then
it
occur
to
her
,
quick
as
thought
could
flash
,
that
it
may
be
well
that
Mr.
Camperdown
should
be
make
to
believe
that
they
have
be
steal
.
<EOS>
and
so
she
keep
her
secret
.
<EOS>
the
reflection
of
the
next
half
-
hour
tell
her
how
very
great
would
now
be
her
difficulty
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
she
have
not
disclose
the
truth
at
first
,
she
could
hardly
disclose
it
now
.
   
<EOS>
the
Journey
to
London
 
<EOS>
when
we
leave
Lady
Eustace
alone
in
her
bedroom
at
the
Carlisle
hotel
after
the
discovery
of
the
robbery
,
she
have
very
many
care
upon
her
mind
.
<EOS>
the
necklace
be
,
indeed
,
safe
under
her
pillow
in
the
bed
;
but
when
all
the
people
be
around
her
,
 
her
own
friend
,
and
the
police
,
and
they
who
be
concern
with
the
inn
,
 
<EOS>
she
have
not
tell
them
that
it
be
so
,
but
have
allow
them
to
leave
her
with
the
belief
that
the
diamond
have
go
with
the
box
.
<EOS>
even
at
this
moment
,
as
she
know
well
,
step
be
be
take
to
discover
the
thief
,
and
to
make
public
the
circumstance
of
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
already
,
no
doubt
,
the
fact
that
her
chamber
have
be
enter
in
the
night
,
and
her
jewel
-
box
withdrawn
,
be
know
to
the
London
police
officer
.
<EOS>
in
such
circumstance
how
could
she
now
tell
the
truth
?
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
that
already
have
the
thief
be
take
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
would
not
the
truth
be
know
,
even
though
she
should
not
tell
it
?
<EOS>
then
she
think
for
a
while
that
she
would
get
rid
of
the
diamond
altogether
,
so
that
no
one
should
know
aught
of
them
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
only
think
of
a
place
fit
for
such
purpose
she
would
so
hide
them
that
no
human
ingenuity
could
discover
them
.
<EOS>
let
the
thief
say
what
they
may
,
her
word
would
,
in
such
case
,
be
well
than
that
of
the
thief
.
<EOS>
She
would
declare
that
the
jewel
have
be
in
the
box
when
the
box
be
take
.
<EOS>
the
thief
would
swear
that
the
box
have
be
empty
.
<EOS>
She
would
appeal
to
the
absence
of
the
diamond
,
and
the
thief
,
 
who
would
be
know
as
thief
,
 
would
be
suppose
,
even
by
their
own
friend
and
associate
,
to
have
dispose
of
the
diamond
before
they
have
be
take
.
<EOS>
there
would
be
a
mystery
in
all
this
,
and
a
cunning
cleverness
,
the
idea
of
which
have
in
itself
a
certain
charm
for
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
all
the
world
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
could
do
nothing
further
to
harass
her
;
and
would
have
be
,
so
far
,
overcome
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
save
from
the
feeling
of
public
defeat
in
the
affair
of
the
necklace
,
which
would
be
very
dreadful
to
her
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
may
probably
be
again
at
her
foot
.
<EOS>
and
in
all
the
fuss
and
rumour
which
such
an
affair
would
make
in
London
,
there
would
be
nothing
of
which
she
nee
be
ashamed
.
<EOS>
She
like
the
idea
,
and
she
have
grow
to
be
very
sick
of
the
necklace
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
should
she
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
It
be
,
at
this
moment
,
between
her
finger
beneath
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
minded
,
 
<EOS>
and
she
think
she
be
so
minded
,
 
to
get
rid
of
it
altogether
<EOS>
,
the
sea
would
be
the
place
.
<EOS>
Could
she
make
up
her
mind
absolutely
to
destroy
so
large
a
property
,
it
would
be
good
for
her
to
have
recourse
to
"
her
own
broad
wave
,
"
as
she
call
them
even
to
herself
.
<EOS>
It
be
within
the
"
friendly
depth
of
her
own
rock
-
girt
ocean
"
that
she
should
find
a
grave
for
her
great
trouble
.
<EOS>
but
now
her
back
be
to
the
sea
,
and
she
could
hardly
insist
on
return
to
Portray
without
excite
a
suspicion
that
may
be
fatal
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
may
it
not
be
possible
to
get
altogether
quit
of
the
diamond
and
yet
to
retain
the
power
of
future
possession
?
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
be
run
into
debt
,
and
that
money
would
,
some
day
,
be
much
need
.
<EOS>
Her
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Benjamin
,
the
jeweller
,
be
a
fact
often
present
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
may
not
be
able
to
get
ten
thousand
pound
from
Mr.
Benjamin
;
 
but
if
she
could
get
eight
,
or
six
,
or
even
five
,
how
pleasant
would
it
be
!
<EOS>
if
she
could
put
away
the
diamond
for
three
or
four
year
,
 
if
she
could
so
hide
them
that
no
human
eye
could
see
them
till
she
should
again
produce
them
to
the
light
,
 
surely
,
after
so
long
an
interval
,
they
may
be
make
available
!
<EOS>
but
where
should
be
find
such
hiding
-
place
?
<EOS>
She
understand
well
how
great
be
the
peril
while
the
necklace
be
in
her
own
immediate
keeping
.
<EOS>
any
accident
may
discover
it
,
and
if
the
slight
suspicion
be
arouse
,
the
police
would
come
upon
her
with
violence
and
discover
it
.
<EOS>
but
surely
there
must
be
some
such
hiding
-
place
,
 
if
only
she
could
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
then
her
mind
revert
to
all
the
story
she
have
ever
hear
of
mysterious
villanie
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
some
way
of
accomplish
this
thing
,
if
she
could
only
bring
her
mind
to
work
upon
it
exclusively
.
<EOS>
a
hole
dig
deep
into
the
ground
;
 
would
not
that
be
the
place
?
<EOS>
but
then
,
where
should
the
hole
be
dig
?
<EOS>
in
what
spot
should
she
trust
the
earth
?
<EOS>
if
anywhere
,
it
must
be
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
but
now
she
be
go
from
Portray
to
London
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
her
to
be
certain
that
she
could
dig
no
hole
in
London
that
would
be
secret
to
herself
.
<EOS>
nor
could
she
trust
herself
,
during
the
hour
or
two
that
remain
to
her
,
to
find
such
a
hole
in
Carlisle
.
  
<EOS>
what
she
want
be
a
friend
;
 
some
one
that
she
could
trust
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
no
such
friend
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
dare
to
give
the
jewel
up
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
so
tempt
,
would
not
any
Corsair
appropriate
the
treasure
?
<EOS>
and
if
,
as
may
be
possible
,
she
be
mistaken
about
him
and
he
be
no
Corsair
,
then
would
he
betray
her
to
the
police
?
<EOS>
She
think
of
all
her
dear
friend
,
 
Frank
Greystock
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
Lucinda
,
Miss
Macnulty
,
 
even
of
Patience
Crabstick
,
 
but
there
be
no
friend
whom
she
could
trust
.
<EOS>
whatever
she
do
she
must
do
alone
!
<EOS>
She
begin
to
fear
that
the
load
of
thought
require
would
be
more
than
she
could
bear
.
<EOS>
one
thing
,
however
,
be
certain
to
her
;
 
she
could
not
now
venture
to
tell
them
all
that
the
necklace
be
in
her
possession
,
and
that
the
steal
box
have
be
empty
.
  
<EOS>
think
of
all
this
,
she
go
to
sleep
,
 
still
hold
the
packet
tight
between
her
finger
,
 
and
in
this
position
be
awaken
at
about
ten
by
a
knock
at
the
door
from
her
friend
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
jump
out
of
bed
,
and
admit
her
friend

<EOS>
"
You
have
better
get
up
now
,
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
all
go
to
breakfast
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
declare
herself
to
be
so
fluttered
,
that
she
must
have
her
breakfast
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
no
one
be
to
wait
for
her
.
<EOS>
Crabstick
would
go
down
and
fetch
for
her
a
cup
of
tea
,
 
and
just
a
morsel
of
something
to
eat
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
surprised
that
I
should
not
be
quite
myself
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
surprise
do
not
run
at
all
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
both
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lord
George
have
be
astonish
to
find
how
well
she
bear
her
loss
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
give
her
credit
for
real
bravery
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
suggest
,
in
a
whisper
,
that
perhaps
she
regard
the
theft
as
an
easy
way
out
of
a
lawsuit
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
know
,
George
,
they
would
have
get
it
from
her
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lord
George
whistle
,
and
,
in
another
whisper
,
declare
that
,
if
the
little
adventure
have
all
be
arrange
by
Lady
Eustace
herself
with
the
view
of
get
the
well
of
Mr.
Camperdown
,
his
respect
for
that
lady
would
be
very
greatly
raise
.
<EOS>
"
if
,
"
say
Lord
George
,
"
it
turn
out
that
she
have
have
a
couple
of
bravos
in
her
pay
,
like
an
old
italian
marquis
,
I
shall
think
very
highly
of
her
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
this
have
occur
before
Mrs.
Carbuncle
come
up
to
Lizzie
's
room
;
 
but
neither
of
them
for
a
moment
suspect
that
the
necklace
be
still
within
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
the
box
have
be
find
,
and
a
portion
of
the
fragment
be
bring
into
the
room
while
the
party
be
still
at
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
not
in
the
room
,
but
the
news
be
at
once
take
up
to
her
by
Crabstick
,
together
with
a
pheasant
's
wing
and
some
butter
toast
.
<EOS>
in
a
recess
beneath
an
archway
run
under
the
railroad
,
not
distant
from
the
hotel
above
a
hundred
and
fifty
yard
,
the
iron
box
have
be
find
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
force
open
,
so
say
the
sergeant
of
police
,
with
tool
of
the
fine
steel
,
peculiarly
make
for
such
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
sergeant
of
police
be
quite
sure
that
the
thing
have
be
do
by
London
man
who
be
at
the
very
top
of
their
trade
.
<EOS>
It
be
manifest
that
nothing
have
be
spare
.
<EOS>
every
motion
of
the
party
must
have
be
know
to
them
,
and
probably
one
of
the
adventurer
have
travel
in
the
same
train
with
them
.
<EOS>
and
the
very
door
of
the
bedroom
in
the
hotel
have
be
measure
by
the
man
who
have
cut
out
the
bolt
.
<EOS>
the
sergeant
of
police
be
almost
lose
in
admiration
;
 
but
the
superintendent
of
police
,
whom
Lord
George
see
more
than
once
,
be
discreet
and
silent
.
<EOS>
to
the
superintendent
of
police
it
be
by
no
means
sure
that
Lord
George
himself
may
not
be
fond
of
diamond
.
<EOS>
of
a
suspicion
fly
so
delightfully
high
as
this
,
he
breathe
no
word
to
any
one
;
but
simply
suggest
that
he
should
like
to
retain
the
companionship
of
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
if
Lady
Eustace
could
dispense
with
the
service
of
the
tall
footman
,
the
tall
footman
may
be
find
useful
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
It
be
arrange
,
therefore
,
that
the
tall
footman
should
remain
;
 
and
the
tall
footman
do
remain
,
though
not
with
his
own
consent
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
party
,
include
Lady
Eustace
herself
and
Patience
Crabstick
,
be
call
upon
to
give
their
evidence
to
the
Carlisle
magistrate
before
they
could
proceed
to
London
.
<EOS>
this
Lizzie
do
,
have
the
necklace
at
that
moment
lock
up
in
her
desk
at
the
inn
.
<EOS>
the
diamond
be
suppose
to
be
worth
ten
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
a
lawsuit
about
them
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
for
a
moment
doubt
that
they
be
her
property
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
very
careful
about
the
diamond
because
of
the
lawsuit
.
<EOS>
fear
that
Mr.
Camperdown
may
wrest
them
from
her
possession
,
she
have
cause
the
iron
box
to
be
make
.
<EOS>
She
have
last
see
the
diamond
on
the
evening
before
her
departure
from
Portray
.
<EOS>
She
have
then
herself
lock
them
up
,
and
she
now
produce
the
key
.
<EOS>
the
lock
be
still
so
far
uninjured
that
the
key
would
turn
it
.
<EOS>
that
be
her
evidence
.
<EOS>
crabstick
,
with
a
good
deal
of
reticence
,
support
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
the
diamond
,
no
doubt
,
but
have
not
see
them
often
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
them
down
at
Portray
,
but
not
for
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
Crabstick
have
very
little
to
say
about
them
;
but
the
clever
superintendent
be
by
no
means
sure
that
Crabstick
do
not
know
more
than
she
say
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lord
George
have
also
see
the
diamond
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
the
diamond
have
be
in
the
iron
box
;
 
nor
be
there
,
say
Lord
George
,
any
doubt
but
that
this
special
necklace
have
acquire
so
much
public
notice
from
the
fact
of
the
threaten
lawsuit
,
as
may
make
its
circumstance
and
value
know
to
London
thief
.
<EOS>
the
tall
footman
be
not
examine
,
but
be
detain
by
the
police
under
a
remand
give
by
the
magistrate
.
  
<EOS>
much
information
as
to
what
have
be
do
ooze
out
in
spite
of
the
precaution
of
the
discreet
superintendent
.
<EOS>
the
wire
have
be
put
into
operation
in
every
direction
,
and
it
have
be
discover
that
one
man
whom
nobody
know
have
leave
the
down
mail
train
at
Annan
,
and
another
at
dumfrie
.
<EOS>
these
man
have
take
ticket
by
the
train
leave
Carlisle
between
four
and
five
a.m.
,
and
be
suppose
to
have
be
the
two
thief
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
nearly
seven
before
the
theft
have
be
discover
,
and
by
that
time
not
only
have
the
man
reach
the
town
name
,
but
have
have
time
to
make
their
way
back
again
or
farther
on
into
Scotland
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
for
the
present
,
all
trace
of
them
be
lose
.
<EOS>
the
sergeant
of
police
do
not
doubt
but
that
one
of
these
man
be
make
his
way
up
to
London
with
the
necklace
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
this
be
tell
to
Lizzie
by
Lord
George
;
and
though
she
be
awe
-
strike
by
the
danger
of
her
situation
,
she
nevertheless
do
feel
some
satisfaction
in
remember
that
she
and
she
only
hold
the
key
of
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
and
then
as
to
those
poor
thief
!
<EOS>
what
must
have
be
their
consternation
when
they
find
,
after
all
the
labour
and
peril
of
the
night
,
that
the
box
contain
no
diamond
,
 
that
the
treasure
be
not
there
,
and
that
they
be
nevertheless
bind
to
save
themselves
by
flight
and
stratagem
from
the
hand
of
the
police
!
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
as
she
think
of
this
,
almost
pity
the
poor
thief
.
<EOS>
what
a
consternation
there
would
be
among
the
Camperdowns
and
Garnetts
,
among
the
Mopuses
and
Benjamins
,
when
the
news
be
hear
in
London
!
<EOS>
Lizzie
almost
enjoy
it
.
<EOS>
as
her
mind
go
on
make
fresh
scheme
on
the
subject
,
a
morbid
desire
of
increase
the
mystery
take
possession
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
sure
that
nobody
know
her
secret
,
and
that
nobody
as
yet
could
even
guess
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
great
danger
,
but
there
may
be
delight
and
even
profit
if
she
could
safely
dispose
of
the
jewel
before
suspicion
against
herself
should
be
arouse
.
<EOS>
She
could
understand
that
a
rumour
should
get
to
the
police
that
the
box
have
be
empty
,
even
if
the
thief
be
not
take
;
 
but
such
rumour
would
avail
nothing
if
she
could
only
dispose
of
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
as
she
first
think
of
all
this
,
the
only
plan
hitherto
suggest
to
herself
would
require
her
immediate
return
to
Portray
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
at
Portray
she
could
find
a
spot
in
which
she
could
bury
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
oblige
to
allow
herself
now
to
be
hurry
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
when
she
get
into
the
train
the
little
parcel
be
in
her
desk
,
and
the
key
of
her
desk
be
fasten
round
her
neck
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
secure
a
compartment
for
themselves
from
Carlisle
to
London
,
and
of
course
fill
four
seat
.
<EOS>
"
as
I
be
alive
,
"
say
Lord
George
as
soon
as
the
train
have
leave
the
station
,
"
that
head
policeman
think
that
I
be
the
thief
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
laugh
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
protest
that
this
be
absurd
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
declare
that
such
a
suspicion
would
be
vastly
amusing
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
fact
,
"
continue
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
it
in
the
fellow
's
eye
,
and
I
feel
it
to
be
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
very
"
cute
that
they
delight
in
suspicion
.
<EOS>
I
remember
,
when
the
altar
-
plate
be
steal
from
Barchester
Cathedral
some
year
ago
,
a
splendid
idea
occur
to
one
of
the
police
,
that
the
Bishop
have
take
it
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
really
?
"
ask
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
 
really
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
but
that
there
be
already
a
belief
in
some
of
their
mind
that
you
have
steal
your
own
diamond
for
the
sake
of
get
the
well
of
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
what
could
I
do
with
them
if
I
have
?
"
ask
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
sell
them
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
there
be
always
a
market
for
such
good
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
who
would
buy
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
be
so
clever
,
Lady
Eustace
,
I
will
find
a
purchaser
for
them
.
<EOS>
one
would
have
to
go
a
good
distance
to
do
it
,
 
and
there
would
be
some
expense
.
<EOS>
but
the
thing
could
be
do
.
<EOS>
Vienna
,
I
should
think
,
would
be
about
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
well
,
then
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
surprised
if
I
ask
you
to
take
the
journey
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
then
they
all
laugh
,
and
be
very
much
amuse
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
agree
among
them
that
Lizzie
bear
her
loss
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
care
the
least
for
lose
them
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
 
"
only
that
Florian
give
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
such
a
vexation
to
me
that
to
be
without
them
will
be
a
comfort
.
"
<EOS>
Her
desk
have
be
bring
into
the
carriage
and
be
now
use
as
a
foot
-
stool
in
place
of
the
box
which
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
They
arrive
at
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
in
Hertford
Street
quite
late
,
between
ten
and
eleven
;
 
but
a
note
have
be
send
from
Lizzie
to
her
cousin
Frank
's
address
from
the
Euston
Square
station
by
a
commissionaire
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
two
note
be
send
,
 
one
to
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
the
other
to
the
Grosvenor
Hotel
.
<EOS>
"
My
necklace
have
be
steal
.
<EOS>
come
to
me
early
to
-
morrow
at
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
,
<EOS>
no
.
 
,
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
"
and
he
do
come
,
 
before
Lizzie
be
up
.
<EOS>
Crabstick
bring
her
mistress
word
that
Mr.
Greystock
be
in
the
parlour
soon
after
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
again
hurry
on
her
clothe
so
that
she
may
see
her
cousin
,
take
care
as
she
do
so
that
though
her
toilet
may
betray
haste
,
it
should
not
be
other
than
charming
.
<EOS>
and
as
she
dress
she
endeavour
to
come
to
some
conclusion
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
good
for
her
that
she
should
tell
everything
to
her
cousin
,
and
throw
herself
upon
his
mercy
,
trust
to
his
ingenuity
to
extricate
her
from
her
difficulty
?
<EOS>
She
have
be
think
of
her
position
almost
through
the
entire
night
,
and
have
remember
that
at
Carlisle
she
have
commit
perjury
.
<EOS>
She
have
swear
that
the
diamond
have
be
leave
by
her
in
the
box
.
<EOS>
and
should
they
be
find
with
her
<EOS>
it
may
be
that
they
would
put
her
in
gaol
for
steal
them
.
<EOS>
little
mercy
could
she
expect
from
Mr.
Camperdown
<EOS>
should
she
fall
into
that
gentleman
's
hand
!
<EOS>
but
Frank
,
if
she
would
even
yet
tell
him
everything
honestly
,
may
probably
save
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
this
about
the
diamond
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
as
soon
as
he
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
fly
almost
into
his
arm
as
though
carry
there
by
the
excitement
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
really
mean
that
they
have
be
steal
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
Frank
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
journey
?
"
  
"
yes
,
Frank
;
 
at
the
inn
at
Carlisle
.
"
  
"
Box
and
all
?
"
then
she
tell
him
the
whole
story
;
 
not
the
true
story
,
but
the
story
as
it
be
believe
by
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
find
it
to
be
impossible
to
tell
him
the
true
story
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
box
be
break
open
,
and
leave
in
the
street
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
under
an
archway
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
the
police
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
they
think
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
say
that
they
believe
he
be
the
thief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
know
of
them
,
"
say
Frank
,
as
though
he
imagine
that
the
suggestion
be
not
altogether
absurd
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
 
he
know
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
be
to
be
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
send
for
you
to
tell
me
.
"
<EOS>
then
Frank
aver
that
information
should
be
immediately
give
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
He
would
himself
call
on
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and

the

<EOS>
He
do
not
doubt
but
that
all
the
circumstance
be
already
know
in
London
at
the
police
office
;
 
but
it
may
be
well
that
he
should
see
the
officer
.
<EOS>
He
be
acquaint
with
the
gentleman
,
and
may
perhaps
learn
something
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
at
once
accede
,
and
Frank
go
direct
to
Mr.

"
if
I

that
way

Mrs.
Carbuncle

"
I
think
I
should
have
break
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
feel
that
her
heart
be
burst
rather
than
be
break

because
the

thousand

worth
of
diamond
be
not
really

Lucy
Morris
in
Brook
Street
 
<EOS>
Lucy
Morris
go
to
Lady
Linlithgow
early
in
October
,
and
be
still
with
Lady
Linlithgow
when
Lizzie
Eustace
return
to
London
in
January
.
<EOS>
during
these
three
month
she
certainly
have
not
be
happy
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
she
have
not
once
see
her
lover
.
<EOS>
this
have
arouse
no
anger
or
suspicion
in
her
bosom
against
him
,
because
the
old
countess
have
tell
her
that
she
would
have
no
lover
come
to
the
house
,
and
that
,
above
all
,
she
would
not
allow
a
young
man
with
whom
she
herself
be
connect
to
come
in
that
guise
to
her
companion
.
<EOS>
"
from
all
I
hear
,
"
say
Lady
Linlithgow
,
"
it
be
not
at
all
likely
to
be
a
match
;
 
and
at
any
rate
it
can
not
go
on
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
think
that
she
would
be
do
no
more
than
stand
up
properly
for
her
lover
by
assert
her
conviction
that
it
would
be
a
match
;
 
and
she
do
assert
it
bravely
;
but
she
make
no
petition
for
his
presence
,
and
bear
that
trouble
bravely
.
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
Frank
be
not
a
satisfactory
correspondent
.
<EOS>
He
do
write
to
her
occasionally
;
 
and
he
write
also
to
the
old
countess
immediately
on
his
return
to
town
from
Bobsborough
a
letter
which
be
intend
as
an
answer
to
that
which
she
have
write
to
Mrs.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
what
be
say
in
that
letter
Lucy
never
know
;
 
but
<EOS>
she
do
know
that
Frank
's
few
letter
to
herself
be
not
full
and
hearty
,
 
be
not
such
thorough
-
go
love
-
letter
as
lover
write
to
each
other
when
they
feel
unlimited
satisfaction
in
the
work
.
<EOS>
She
excuse
him
,
 
tell
herself
that
he
be
overwork
,
that
with
his
double
trade
of
legislator
and
lawyer
he
could
hardly
be
expect
to
write
letter
,
 
that
man
,
in
respect
of
letter
-
writing
,
be
not
as
woman
be
,
and
the
like
;
but
still
there
grow
at
her
heart
a
little
weed
of
care
,
which
from
week
to
week
spread
its
noxious
,
heavy
-
scented
leave
,
and
rob
her
of
her
joyousness
.
<EOS>
to
be
love
by
her
lover
,
and
to
feel
that
she
be
his
,
 
to
have
a
lover
of
her
own
to
whom
she
could
thoroughly
devote
herself
,
 
to
be
conscious
that
she
be
one
of
those
happy
woman
in
the
world
who
find
a
mate
worthy
of
worship
as
well
as
love
,
 
this
to
her
be
so
great
a
joy
that
even
the
sadness
of
her
present
position
could
not
utterly
depress
her
.
<EOS>
from
day
to
day
she
assure
herself
that
she
do
not
doubt
and
would
not
doubt
,
 
that
there
be
no
cause
for
doubt
;
 
that
she
would
herself
be
base
be
she
to
admit
any
shadow
of
suspicion
.
<EOS>
but
yet
his
absence
,
 
and
the
shortness
of
those
little
note
,
which
come
perhaps
once
a
fortnight
,
do
tell
upon
her
in
opposition
to
her
own
conviction
.
<EOS>
each
note
as
it
come
be
answer
,
 
instantly
;
but
she
would
not
write
except
when
the
note
come
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
seem
to
reproach
him
by
write
oftener
than
he
write
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
give
her
so
much
,
and
she
have
nothing
but
her
confidence
to
give
in
return
,
would
she
stint
him
in
that
?
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
love
,
she
say
,
without
confidence
,
and
it
be
the
pride
of
her
heart
to
love
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
circumstance
of
her
present
life
be
desperately
weary
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
understand
why
it
be
that
Lady
Linlithgow
should
desire
her
presence
.
<EOS>
She
be
require
to
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
duty
to
perform
,
and
,
as
it
seem
to
her
,
be
of
no
use
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
the
countess
would
not
even
allow
her
to
be
of
ordinary
service
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
,
as
she
have
say
of
herself
,
poke
her
own
fire
,
carve
her
own
meat
,
light
her
own
candle
,
open
and
shut
the
door
for
herself
,
write
her
own
letter
,
 
and
do
not
even
like
to
have
book
read
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
simply
choose
to
have
some
one
sit
with
her
to
whom
she
could
speak
and
make
little
cross
-
grained
,
sarcastic
,
and
ill
-
natured
remark
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
company
at
the
house
in
Brook
Street
,
and
when
the
countess
herself
go
out
,
she
go
out
alone
.
<EOS>
even
when
she
have
a
cab
to
go
shopping
,
or
to
make
call
,
she
rarely
ask
Lucy
to
go
with
her
,
 
and
be
benevolent
chiefly
in
this
,
 
that
if
Lucy
choose
to
walk
round
the
square
,
or
as
far
as
the
park
,
her
ladyship
's
maid
be
allow
to
accompany
her
for
protection
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lucy
often
tell
herself
that
such
a
life
would
be
unbearable
,
 
be
it
not
for
the
supreme
satisfaction
she
have
in
remember
her
lover
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
arrangement
have
be
make
only
for
six
month
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
feel
quite
assured
of
her
fate
at
the
end
of
those
six
month
,
but
she
believe
that
there
would
come
to
her
a
residence
in
a
sort
of
outer
garden
to
that
sweet
Elysium
in
which
she
be
to
pass
her
life
.
<EOS>
the
Elysium
would
be
Frank
's
house
;
and
the
outer
garden
be
the
deanery
at
Bobsborough
.
  
<EOS>
twice
during
the
three
month
Lady
Fawn
,
with
two
of
the
girl
,
come
to
call
upon
her
.
<EOS>
on
the
first
occasion
she
be
unluckily
out
,
take
advantage
of
the
protection
of
her
ladyship
's
maid
in
get
a
little
air
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
have
also
be
away
,
and
Lady
Fawn
have
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
afterwards
,
both
Lucy
and
her
ladyship
be
find
at
home
,
and
Lady
Fawn
be
full
of
graciousness
and
affection
.
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
you
have
get
something
to
say
to
each
other
,
"
say
Lady
Linlithgow
,
"
and
I
will
go
away

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do

us
disturb
you

Lady

<EOS>
"
You
would
only
abuse
me
if
I
do

say
Lady
Linlithgow

<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
be
go
Lucy
rush
into
her
friend
's
arm

<EOS>
"
It
be
so
nice
to

you
again

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

my

I
do

<EOS>
"
You

be
so
good

<EOS>
to

"
She
be
crouch
close
to
Lady
Fawn
,
with
her
hand
in
that
of
her
friend
Lydia
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
Lady
Linlithgow
,
but
it
be
like
winter
here
,
after
dear
Richmond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
we
think
we
be
pretty
at
Richmond
,
"

Lady
Fawn

<EOS>
"
there
be
such
hundred
of
thing
to
do
there
,
"
say
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
after
all
,
what
a
comfort
it
be
to
have
thing
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
come
away
?
"
say
Lydia

<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
be
oblige
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
scold
me
now
that
you
have
come
to
see
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
hundred
thing
to
be
say
about
Fawn
Court
and
the
child
,
and
a
hundred
more
thing
about
Lady
Linlithgow
and
Bruton
Street
.
<EOS>
then
,
at
last
,
Lady
Fawn
ask
the
one
important
question
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
dear
,
what
about
Mr.
Greystock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
 
I
do
not
know
;
 
nothing
particular
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
as
it
be
,
and
I
be
 
quite
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
him
sometimes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
never
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
him
since
the
last
time
he
come
down
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
do
not
allow
 
follower
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
pleasant
little
spark
of
laughter
in
Lucy
's
eye
as
she
say
this
,
which
would
have
tell
to
any
bystander
the
whole
story
of
the
affection
which
exist
between
her
and
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
ill
-
natured
,
"
say
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
be
a
sort
of
cousin
,
too
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
the
reason
why
,
"
say
Lucy
,
explain
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
Lady
Linlithgow
think
that
her
sister
's
nephew
can
do
better
than
marry
her
companion
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
matter
of
course
she
should
think
so
.
<EOS>
what
I
be
most
afraid
of
be
that
the
dean
and
Mrs.
Greystock
should
think
so
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
no
doubt
the
dean
and
Mrs.
Greystock
would
think
so
;
 
Lady
Fawn
be
very
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
be
one
of
the
good
woman
breathe
,
 
unselfish
,
motherly
,
affectionate
,
appreciative
,
and
never
happy
unless
she
be
do
good
to
somebody
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
nature
to
be
soft
,
and
kind
,
and
beneficent
.
<EOS>
but
she
know
very
well
that
if
she
have
have
a
son
,
 
a
second
son
,
 
situate
as
be
Frank
Greystock
<EOS>
,
she
would
not
wish
him
to
marry
a
girl
without
a
penny
,
who
be
force
to
earn
her
bread
by
be
a
governess
.
<EOS>
the
sacrifice
on
Mr.
Greystock
's
part
would
,
in
her
estimation
,
be
so
great
,
that
she
do
not
believe
that
it
would
be
make
.
<EOS>
woman
-
like
,
she
regard
the
man
as
be
so
much
more
important
than
the
woman
,
that
she
could
not
think
that
Frank
Greystock
would
devote
himself
simply
to
such
a
one
as
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
have
Lady
Fawn
be
ask
which
be
the
well
creature
of
the
two
,
her
late
governess
or
the
rise
barrister
who
have
declare
himself
to
be
that
governess
's
lover
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
say
that
no
man
could
be
well
than
Lucy
.
<EOS>
She
know
Lucy
's
worth
and
goodness
so
well
that
she
be
ready
herself
to
do
any
act
of
friendship
on
behalf
of
one
so
sweet
and
excellent
.
<EOS>
for
herself
and
her
girl
Lucy
be
a
companion
and
friend
in
every
way
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
but
be
it
probable
that
a
man
of
the
world
,
such
as
be
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
,
a
rise
man
,
a
member
of
Parliament
,
one
who
,
as
everybody
know
,
be
especially
in
want
of
money
,
 
be
it
probable
that
such
a
man
as
this
would
make
her
his
wife
just
because
she
be
good
,
and
worthy
,
and
sweet
-
natured
?
<EOS>
no
doubt
the
man
have
say
that
he
would
do
so
,
 
and
Lady
Fawn
's
fear
betray
on
her
ladyship
's
part
a
very
bad
opinion
of
man
in
general
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
to
be
a
paradox
to
assert
that
such
bad
opinion
spring
from
the
high
idea
which
she
entertain
of
the
importance
of
man
in
general
;
 
but
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
but
one
son
,
and
of
all
her
child
he
be
the
least
worthy
;
but
he
be
more
important
to
her
than
all
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
between
her
own
girl
and
Lucy
she
hardly
make
any
difference
;
 
but
when
her
son
have
choose
to
quarrel
with
Lucy
it
have
be
necessary
to
send
Lucy
to
eat
her
meal
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
believe
that
Mr.
Greystock
should
think
so
much
of
such
a
little
girl
as
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Greystock
would
no
doubt
behave
very
badly
in
not
do
so
;
 
but
then
man
do
so
often
behave
very
badly
!
<EOS>
and
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
almost
think
that
they
may
be
excuse
for
do
so
.
<EOS>
accord
to
her
view
of
thing
,
a
man
out
in
the
world
have
so
many
thing
to
think
of
,
and
be
so
very
important
,
that
he
could
hardly
be
expect
to
act
at
all
time
with
truth
and
sincerity
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
have
suggest
that
the
dean
and
Mrs.
Greystock
would
dislike
the
marriage
,
and
upon
that
hint
Lady
Fawn
speak
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
be
settle
,
I
suppose
,
as
to
where
you
be
to
go
when
the
six
month
be
over
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
nothing
as
yet
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
not
ask
you
to
go
to
Bobsborough
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
would
have
give
the
world
not
to
blush
as
she
answer
,
but
she
do
blush
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
be
fix
,
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
something
should
be
fix
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
It
should
be
settle
by
this
time
;
 
should
not
it
,
dear
?
<EOS>
what
will
you
do
without
a
home
,
if
at
the
end
of
the
six
month
Lady
Linlithgow
should
say
that
she
do
not
want
you
any
more
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
certainly
do
not
look
forward
to
a
condition
in
which
Lady
Linlithgow
should
be
the
arbitress
of
her
destiny
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
stay
with
the
countess
be
almost
as
bad
to
her
as
that
of
find
herself
altogether
homeless
.
<EOS>
She
be
still
blush
,
feel
herself
to
be
hot
and
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Fawn
sit
,
wait
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
to
Lucy

"
it
be
not

a
question
of
belief

one
of
common
prudence

<EOS>
no

man
before

by

the
tear

stream
down

so
that

the

suspect

that

it

the

plead
their

their
long
absence

poor
Lucy

emotional
state

<EOS>
then
she
take

leave

Lucy

as
soon

she
have
be
kiss
by

outside

They
have

from
what
I

I
should

It

She
be
clever
enough

,

I
know
all
about

it
would
be
very
wicked

if
it
be
find
out
she
would
be
put
in
the
dock

try
for
her
life

It
be
just
what
I

she
will
come
to
some
of
these
day

have
go
and
get
up
a
friendship
with
some
disreputable
people

be
travel
with
them

there
be
a
man
who
call
himself
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers

I
know
him

can
remember
when
he
be
errand
-
boy
to
a
disreputable
lawyer
at
Aberdeen

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
assertion
be
a
falsehood

part

Lord
George
have
never
be
an
errand
-
boy
,
and
the
Aberdeen
lawyer
,
 
as
provincial
Scotch
lawyer
go
<EOS>
,
 
have
be
by
no
means
disreputable
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
that
the
police
think
that
he
have
get
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
dreadful
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
it
be
dreadful
enough

<EOS>
at

rate

man
get
into
Lizzie
's
room
at
night
and
take
away
the
iron
box
and
diamond
and
all
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
she
be
asleep
at
the
time
;
 
<EOS>

she
be
one
of
those
who
pretty
nearly
always
sleep
with
one
eye
open

<EOS>
"
She
can
not

so
bad
as
that

Lady

<EOS>
"
perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
.

They
have
just
begin
a
lawsuit
about
the
diamond

to
get
them
back

then
all
at
once
,
 
they
be
steal

It
look
what
the
man
call
 
fishy

be
tell
that
all
the
police

up
about
it

<EOS>
on
the
very
next
day
who
should
come
to
Brook
Street
,
but
Lizzie
Eustace
herself
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
aunt
have
quarrel
,
and
they
hate
each
other
;
 
but
the
old
woman
have
call
upon
Lizzie
,
advise
her
,
as
the
reader
will
perhaps
remember
,
to
give
up
the
diamond
,
and
now
Lizzie
return
the
visit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
you
be
here
,
instal
in
poor
Macnulty

place

Lizzie
to
her
old
friend

the
countess
at
the
moment
be
out
of
the
room

<EOS>
"
I
be
stay
with
your
aunt

a
few
month

her
companion

it
true

Lizzie
,
that
all
your
diamond
have
be
steal

<EOS>
Lizzie
give
an
account
of
the
robbery
,
true
in
every
respect
,
except
in
regard
to
the
content
of
the
box
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lizzie
have
be
wrong
in
that
matter
by
the
countess
,
for
the
robbery
have
be
quite
genuine
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
open
her
room
and
take
her
box
,
and
she
have
sleep
through
it
all
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
broken
box
have
be
find
,
and
be
in
the
hand
of
the
police
,
and
be
evidence
of
the
fact
.
  
<EOS>
"
People
seem
to
think
it
possible
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
"
that
Mr.
Camperdown
the
lawyer
arrange
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
this
suggestion
be
be
make
Lady
Linlithgow
come
in
,
and
then
Lizzie
repeat
the
whole
story
of
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
though
the
aunt
and
niece
be
open
and
declare
enemy
,
the
present
circumstance
be
so
peculiar

full
of
interest
that
conversation
,
for
a
time
almost
amicable
,
take
place
between
them
.
"
<EOS>
as
the
diamond
be
so
valuable
,
I
think
it
right
,
Aunt
Susanna
,
to
come
and
tell
you
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
good
of
you

I
would
hear
it
already

<EOS>
I
be
tell
Miss
Morris
yesterday

what
very
odd
thing
there
be
be
say
about
it

not
you
very
much
frightened

You
see
,
my
child

I

nothing

all
over

the
bit
out

most
beautiful
way

you
that
sleep
so
light

the
countess

perhaps
something
be
put
into
the
wine
at
dinner

make
me
sleep

"
ah
!

ejaculate
the
countess
,
who
do
not
for
a
moment
give
up
her
own
erroneous
suspicion
;
 
"
very
likely
.

"
and
they
do
say
these
people
can
do
thing
without
make
the
slight
tittle
of
noise

at
any
rate
,
the
box

go

the
diamond
?

ask
Lucy

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
;
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
and
now
there
be
such
a
fuss
about
it
!

the
police
keep
on
come
to
me
almost
every
day

"
and
what
do
the
police
think
?

ask
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
that
they
have
their
suspicion

<EOS>

no
doubt
they
have
their
suspicion

Lizzie

travel
up
with
friend

ah

yes

Lord

do
not
care
for
baby

I
can
easily
believe
that

<EOS>
I
wish
Macnulty
have
be
with
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
wish
that
?
"
say
Lizzie
,
who
already
be
begin
to
feel
that
the
countess
intend
,
as
usual
,
to
make
herself
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
stupid
,
dull
,
pig
-
head
creature
;

one
can
believe
what
she
say
.

"
  
"
and
do
not
you
believe
what
I
say
?
"
demand
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
true
,
no
doubt
,
that
the
diamond
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
know
much
about
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
the
brother
of
a
marquis
,
anyway
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
who
think
that
she
may
thus
best
answer
the
mother
of
a
Scotch
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
when
he
be
plain
George
Carruthers
,
run
about
the
street
of
Aberdeen
,
and
it
be
well
with
him
when
his
shoe
be
not
break
at
the
toe
and
down
at
heel
.
<EOS>
He
earn
his
bread
then
,
such
as
it
be
;
 
nobody
know
how
he
get
it
now
.
<EOS>
why
do
he
call
himself
de
Bruce
,
I
wonder
?
"
  
"
because
his
godfather
and
godmother
give
him
that
name
when
he
be
make
a
child
of
Christ
,
and
an
inheritor
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
ever
so
pertly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
a
bit
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
there
to
see
,
Aunt
Susanna
;
and
therefore
I
can
not
swear
to
it

<EOS>
that
be
his
name
in
all
the
peerage

I
suppose
they
ought
to
know

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
Lord
George
de
Bruce
say
about
the
diamond
?
"
  
<EOS>
now
it
have
come
to
pass
that
Lady
Eustace
herself
do
not
feel
altogether
sure
that
Lord
George
have
not
have
a
hand
in
this
robbery
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
a
trick
worthy
of
a
genuine
Corsair
to
arrange
and
carry
out
such
a
scheme
for
the
appropriation
of
so
rich
a
spoil
.
<EOS>
a
watch
or
a
brooch
would
,
of
course
,
be
beneath
the
notice
of
a
good
genuine
Corsair
,
 
of
a
Corsair
who
be
write
down
in
the
peerage
as
a
marquis
's
brother
;
 
but
diamond
worth
ten
thousand
pound
be
not
to
be
have
every
day
.
<EOS>
a
Corsair
must
live
,
and
if
not
by
plunder
rich
as
that
,
 
how
then
?
<EOS>
if
Lord
George
have
concoct
this
little
scheme
,
he
would
naturally
be
ignorant
of
the
true
event
of
the
robbery
till
he
should
meet
the
humble
executor
of
his
design
,
and
would
,
as
Lizzie
think
,
have
remain
unaware
of
the
truth
till
his
arrival
in
London
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
be
ignorant
of
the
truth
during
the
journey
be
evident
to
her
.
<EOS>

at

interview
he
have
be
sullen
and
almost
cross

have
say
next
to
nothing
about
the

He
make
but
one
remark
about
it

"
I
have
tell
the
chief

here

"
that
I
shall

<EOS>
I

be
ask
question
that

"
<EOS>
in
say
this
he
have
use
a
tone
which
prevent
further
conversation
on
the
subject
,
but
Lizzie
,
as
she
think
of
it
all
,
remember
his
jocular
remark
,
make
in
the
railway
carriage
,
as
to
the
suspicion
which
have
already
be
express
on
the
matter
in

to
himself

<EOS>
if
he
have
be
the
perpetrator
,
and
have
then
find
that
he
have
only
steal
the
box
,
how
wonderful
would
be
the
mystery
!
"
<EOS>
He
have
not

the
question

patent
Bramah

<EOS>
Matching
Priory
 
<EOS>
before
the
end
of
January
everybody
in
London
have
hear
of
the
great
robbery
at
Carlisle
,
 
and
most
people
have
hear
also
that
there
be
something
very
peculiar
in
the
matter
,
 
something
more
than
a
robbery
.
<EOS>
various
rumour
be
afloat
.
<EOS>
It
have
become
widely
know
that
the
diamond
be
to
be
the
subject
of
litigation
between
the
young
widow
and
the
trustee
of
the
Eustace
estate
;
and
it
be
know
also
that
Lord
Fawn
have
engage
himself
to
marry
the
widow
,
and
have
then
retreat
from
his
engagement
simply
on
account
of
this
litigation
.
<EOS>
there
be
strong
party
form
in
the
matter
,
 
whom
we
may
call
Lizzieites
and
anti
-
lizzieite
.
<EOS>
the
Lizzieites
be
of
opinion
that
poor
Lady
Eustace
be
be
very
ill
-
treat
;
 
that
the
diamond
do
probably
belong
to
her
,
and
that
Lord
Fawn
,
at
any
rate
,
clearly
ought
to
be
her
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
worthy
of
remark
that
these
lizzieite
be
all
of
them
Conservatives
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
have
probably
set
the
party
on
foot
;
 
and
it
be
natural
that
political
opponent
should
believe
that
a
noble
young
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
on
the
liberal
side
,
 
such
as
Lord
Fawn
,
 
have
misbehave
himself
.
<EOS>
when
the
matter
at
last
become
of
such
importance
as
to
demand
lead
article
in
the
newspaper
,
those
journal
which
have
devote
themselves
to
uphold
the
conservative
politician
of
the
day
be
very
heavy
indeed
upon
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
the
whole
force
of
the
Government
,
however
,
be
anti
-
lizzieite
;
and
as
the
controversy
advance
,
every
good
Liberal
become
aware
that
there
be
nothing
so
wicked
,
so
rapacious
,
so
bold
,
or
so
cunning
but
that
Lady
Eustace
may
have
do
it
,
or
cause
it
to
be
do
,
without
delay
,
without
difficulty
,
and
without
scruple
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
for
a
while
endeavour
to
defend
Lizzie
in
liberal
circle
,
 
from
generosity
rather
than
from
any
real
belief
,
and
instigate
,
perhaps
,
by
a
feeling
that
any
woman
in
society
who
be
capable
of
do
anything
extraordinary
ought
to
be
defend
.
<EOS>
but
even
Lady
Glencora
be
force
to
abandon
her
generosity
,
and
to
confess
,
on
behalf
of
her
party
,
that
Lizzie
Eustace
be
 
a
very
wicked
young
woman
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
all
this
,
no
doubt
,
grow
out
of
the
diamond
,
and
chiefly
arise
from
the
robbery
;
but
there
have
be
enough
of
notoriety
attach
to
Lizzie
before
the
affair
at
Carlisle
to
make
people
fancy
that
they
have
understand
her
character
long
before
that
.
  
<EOS>
the
party
assemble
at
Matching
Priory
,
a
country
house
belong
to
Mr.
Palliser
,
in
which
Lady
Glencora
take
much
delight
,
be
not
large
,
because
Mr.
Palliser
's
uncle
,
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
who
be
with
them
,
be
now
a
very
old
man
,
and
one
who
do
not
like
very
large
gathering
of
people
.
<EOS>
Lord
and
Lady
Chiltern
be
there
,
 
that
Lord
Chiltern
who
have

so
long

so
well
in

so
popular
in
London
as
the
beautiful
Violet

Mr.

very
particular
friend
of
Mr.

Mr.

be
now
sit
for
the
borough
of
Silverbridge
,
in
which
the
Duke

Omnium
be
still
presume
to
have
a
controlling
influence
,
in
spite
of
all
reform
bill

and
Mrs.
Grey
be
in
some
distant
way
connect
with
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
be
there
,
 
a
lady
whose
society
be
still
much
affect
by
the
old
duke
;
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
 
who
have
be
bring
there
,
not
,
perhaps
altogether
because
they
be
greatly
love
,
but
in
order
that
the
gentleman
's
service
may
be
make
available
by
Mr.
Palliser
in
reference
to
some
great
reform
about
to
be
introduce
in
monetary
matter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
be
now
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
be
intend
to
alter
the
value
of
the
penny
.
<EOS>
unless
the
work
should
be
too
much
for
him
,
and
he
should
die
before
he
have
accomplish
the
self
-
impose
task
,
the
future
penny
be
to
be
make
,
under
his
auspex
,
to
contain
five
farthing
,
and
the
shill
ten
penny
.
<EOS>
It
be
think
that
if
this
could
be
accomplish
,
the
arithmetic
of
the
whole
world
would
be
so
simplified
that
henceforward
<EOS>
the
name
of
Palliser
would
be
bless
by
all
schoolboy
,
clerk
,
shopkeeper
,
and
financier
.
<EOS>
but
the
difficulty
be
so
great
that
Mr.
Palliser
's
hair
be
already
grey
from
toil
,
and
his
shoulder
bend
by
the
burthen
impose
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
,
with
two
private
secretary
from
the
Treasury
,
be
now
at
match
to
assist
Mr.
Palliser
;
 
and
it
be
think
that
both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
be
near
to
madness
under
the
pressure
of
the
five
-
farthe
penny
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
have
remark
to
many
of
his
political
friend
that
those
two
extra
farthing
that
could
not
be
make
to
go
into
the
shilling
would
put
him
into
his
cold
grave
before
the
world
would
know
what
he
have
do
,
 
or
have
reward
him
for
it
with
a
handle
to
his
name
,
and
a
pension
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
also
at
Matching
,
 
a
suggestion
have
be
make
to
Lady
Glencora
by
some
lead
liberal
that
he
should
be
support
in
his
difficulty
by
her
hospitality
.
  
<EOS>
the
mind
of
Mr.
Palliser
himself
be
too
deeply
engaged
to
admit
of
its
be
interested
in
the
great
necklace
affair
;
but
,
of
all
the
other
assemble
,
there
be
not
one
who
do
not
listen
anxiously
for
news
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
as
regard
the
old
duke
,
it
have
be
find
to
be
quite
a
godsend
;
and
from
post
to
post
as
the
fact
reach
match
they
be
communicate
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
there
be
some
there
who
would
not
wait
for
the
post
,
but
have
the
news
about
poor
Lizzie
's
diamond
down
by
the
wire
.
<EOS>
the
matter
be
of
the
great
moment
to
Lord
Fawn
,
and
Lady
Glencora
be
,
perhaps
,
justify
,
on
his
behalf
,
in
demand
a
preference
for
her
affair
over
the

"
Barrington

Major

be
an

high

would
only
take

<EOS>
such
be
the
pressing
nature

another

give
up
about
sixteen
hour
a

the
outer

accuse
him
of
idleness

there
be
nothing
he

not
find
out
;
 
only
he
would
not
give
himself
the
trouble
to
find
out
all
the

<EOS>
two
or
three
newspaper
have
already
be
very
hard
upon
him
in
regard
to
the
Eustace

<EOS>
such
a
mystery

that
<EOS>

they
say

he
ought

have
unravel
long

<EOS>
"
the

Madame
Goesler
shrug
her
shoulder
and
make
no
answer
;
but
the
shrugging
of
her
shoulder
be
quite
satisfactory
to
the
duke
,
who
always
think
that
Madame
Goesler
do
everything
well
than
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
stay
with
her
uncle
for
the
good
part
of
an
hour
,
and
every
word
speak
be
devoted
to
Lizzie
and
her
necklace
;
but
as
this
new
idea
have
be
broach
,
and
as
they
have
no
other
information
than
that
convey
in
the
telegram
,
very
little
light
could
be
throw
upon
it
.
<EOS>
but
on
the
next
morning
there
come
a
letter
from
Barrington
Erle
to
Lady
Glencora
,
which
tell
so
much
,
and
hint
so
much
more
,
that
it
will
be
well
to
give
it
to
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>

"
,
29
January
,
186
    
my
dear
lady
glencora
,
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
get
my
telegram
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
see
Mackintosh
,
 
on
whose
behalf
,
however
,
I
must
say
that
he
tell
me
as
little
as
he
possibly
could
.
<EOS>
It
be
leak
out
,
however
,
on
every
side
,
that
the
police
believe
that
when
the
box
be
take
out
of
the
room
at
Carlisle
,
the
diamond
be
not
in
it
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
can
learn
,
they
grind
this
suspicion
on
the
fact
that
they
can
not
trace
the
stone
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
,
if
such
a
lot
of
diamond
have
be
through
the
thief
"
market
in
London
,
they
would
have
leave
some
track
behind
them
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
can
judge
,
Mackintosh
think
that
Lord
George
have
them
,
but
that
her
ladyship
give
them
to
him
;
and
that
this
little
game
of
the
robbery
at
Carlisle
be
plan
to
put
John
Eustace
and
the
lawyer
off
the
scent
.
<EOS>
if
it
should
turn
out
that
the
box
be
open
before
it
leave
Portray
,
that
the
door
of
her
ladyship
's
room
be
cut
by
her
ladyship
's
self
,
or
by
his
lordship
with
her
ladyship
's
aid
,
and
that
the
fragment
of
the
box
be
carry
out
of
the
hotel
by
his
lordship
in
person
,
it
will
altogether
have
be
so
delightful
a
plot
,
that
all
concerned
in
it
ought
to
be
canonise
,
 
or
at
least
allow
to
keep
their
plunder
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
old
detective
tell
me
that
the
opening
of
the
box
under
the
arch
of
the
railway
,
in
an
expose
place
,
could
hardly
have
be
execute
so
neatly
as
be
do
;
 
that
no
thief
so
situated
would
have
give
the
time
necessary
to
it
;
and
that
,
if
there
have
be
thief
at
all
at
work
,
they
would
have
be
trace
.
<EOS>
against
this
,
there
be
the
certain
fact
,
 
as
I
have
hear
from
various
man
engage
in
the
inquiry
,
 
that
certain
person
among
the
community
of
thief
be
very
much
at
loggerhead
with
each
other
,
 
the
high
,
or
creative
department
in
thiefdom
,
accuse
the
low
or
mechanical
department
of
gross
treachery
in
have
appropriate
to
its
own
sole
profit
plunder
,
for
the
taking
of
which
it
have
undertake
to
receive
a
certain
stipulate
price
.
<EOS>
but
then
it
may
be
the
case
that
his
lordship
and
her
ladyship
have
set
such
a
rumour
abroad
for
the
sake
of
put
the
police
off
the
scent
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
the
little
mystery
be
quite
delightful
;
and
have
put
the
ballot
,
and
poor
Mr.
Palliser
's
five
-
farthinge
penny
,
quite
out
of
joint
.
<EOS>
nobody
now
care
for
anything
except
the
Eustace
diamond
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
I
be
tell
,
have
offer
to
fight
everybody
or
anybody
,
begin
with
Lord
Fawn
and
end
with
Major
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
Should
he
be
innocent
,
which
,
of
course
,
be
possible
,
the
thing
must
be
annoying
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
at
all
wonder
myself
,
if
it
should
turn
out
that
her
ladyship
leave
them
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
the
place
there
,
however
,
have
be
search
,
in
compliance
with
an
order
from
the
police
and
by
her
ladyship
's
consent
.
  
<EOS>
do
not
let
Mr.
Palliser
quite
kill
himself
.
<EOS>
I
hope
the
Bonteen
plan
answer
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
a
man
who
could
find
more
farthing
in
a
shilling
than
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
remember
me
very
kindly
to
the
duke
,
and
pray
enable
poor
Fawn
to
keep
up
his
spirit
.
<EOS>
if
he
like
to
arrange
a
meeting
with
Lord
George
,
I
shall
be
only
too
happy
to
be
his
friend
.
<EOS>
You
remember
our
last
duel
.
<EOS>
Chiltern
be
with
you
,
and
can
put
Fawn
up
to
the
proper
way
of
get
over
to
flander
,
 
and
of
return
,
should
he
chance
to
escape
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
always
most
faithfully
,
  
BARRINGTON
ERLE
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
will
keep
you
post
in
everything
respect
the
necklace
till
you
come
to
town
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
of
this
letter
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
read
to
the
duke
,
to
Lady
Chiltern
,
and
to
Madame
Goesler
;
 
and
the
principal
content
of
it
she
repeat
to
the
entire
company
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
the
general
belief
at
match
that
Lord
George
have
the
diamond
in
his
possession
,
 
either
with
or
without
the
assistance
of
their
late
fair
possessor
.
  
<EOS>
the
duke
be
strike
with
awe
when
he
think
of
all
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
brother
of
a
marquis
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
his
nephew
's
wife
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
such
a
disgrace
to
the
peerage
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
for
that
,
duke
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
"
the
peerage
be
use
to
it
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
of
such
an
affair
as
this
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
why
the
brother
of
a
marquis
should
not
turn
thief
as
well
as
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
They
say
he
have
not
get
anything
of
his
own
;
 
and
I
suppose
that
be
what
make
man
steal
other
people
's
property
.
<EOS>
peer
go
into
trade
,
and
peeress
gamble
on
the
Stock
Exchange
.
<EOS>
peer
become
bankrupt
,
and
the
son
of
peer
run
away
;
 
just
like
other
man
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
why
all
enterprise
should
not
be
open
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
to
think
of
that
little
purr
cat
,
Lady
Eustace
,
have
be
so
very
 
very
clever
!
<EOS>
It
make
me
quite
envious
.
"
  
<EOS>
all
this
take
place
in
the
morning
;
 
that
is
,
about
two
o'clock
;
but
after
dinner
the
subject
become
general
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
some
little
reticence
in
regard
to
Lord
Fawn
's
feeling
,
 
but
it
be
not
sufficient
to
banish
a
subject
so
interesting
from
the
mind
and
lip
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Tewett
marriage
be
to
come
off
,
after
all
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
letter
from
dear
Mrs.
Rutter
,
tell
me
so
as
a
fact
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
Miss
Roanoke
will
be
allow
to
wear
one
or
two
of
the
diamond
at
the
wedding
,
"
suggest
one
of
the
private
secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
will
dare
to
wear
a
diamond
at
all
next
season
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
for
my
own
,
I
sha'n't
think
of
have
them
out
.
<EOS>
I
should
always
feel
that
I
be
be
inspect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
unless
they
unravel
the
mystery
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
they
will
not
do
that
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
the
play
be
too
good
to
come
to
an
end
so
soon
.
<EOS>
if
we
hear
that
Lord
George
be
engage
to
Lady
Eustace
,
nothing
,
I
suppose
,
can
be
do
to
stop
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
not
she
marry
if
she
please
?
"
ask
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
slight
objection
to
her
be
marry
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
will
,
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
think
she
should
have
her
husband
after
buy
him
at
such
a
price
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Lord
Fawn
will
not
forbid
the
banns
.
<EOS>
"
these
last
word
be
only
whisper
to
her
next
neighbour
,
Lord
Chiltern
;
but
poor
Lord
Fawn
see
the
whisper
,
and
be
aware
that
it
must
have
have
reference
to
his
condition
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
there
come
further
news
.
<EOS>
the
police
have
ask
permission
from
their
occupant
to
search
the
room
in
which
live
Lady
Eustace
and
Lord
George
,
and
in
each
case
the
permission
have
be
refuse
.
<EOS>
so
say
Barrington
Erle
in
his
letter
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
have
tell
the
applicant
,
very
roughly
,
that
nobody
should
touch
any
article
belong
to
him
without
a
search
-
warrant
.
<EOS>
if
any
magistrate
would
dare
to
give
such
a
warrant
,
let
him
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
that
Lord
George
act
the
indignant
madman
uncommonly
well
,
"
say
Barrington
Erle
in
his
letter
.
<EOS>
as
for
poor
Lizzie
,
she
have
faint
when
the
proposition
be
make
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
request
be
renew
as
soon
as
she
have
be
bring
to
herself
;
and
then
she
refuse
,
 
on
the
advice
,
as
she
say
,
of
her
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
go
on
to
say
that
the
police
be
very
much
blame
.
<EOS>
It
be
believe
that
no
information
could
be
lay
before
a
magistrate
sufficient
to
justify
a
search
-
warrant
;
 
and
,
in
such
circumstance
,
no
search
should
have
be
attempt
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
public
verdict
,
as
declare
in
Barrington
Erle
's
last
letter
to
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
be
of
opinion
that
the
attempt
to
search
the
lady
's
house
be
iniquitous
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
shake
his
head
,
and
rather
think
that
,
if
he
be
Home
Secretary
,
he
would
have
have
the
search
make
.
<EOS>
Lady
Chiltern
say
that
if
policeman
come
to
her
,
they
may
search
everything
she
have
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grey
remind
them
that
all
they
really
know
of
the
unfortunate
woman
be
,
that
her
jewel
-
box
have
be
steal
out
of
her
bedroom
at
her
hotel
.
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
be
of
opinion
that
a
lady
who
could
carry
such
a
box
about
the
country
with
her
deserved
to
have
it
steal
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
feel
himself
oblige
to
confess
that
he
agree
altogether
with
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
,
he
have
be
acquaint
with
the
lady
,
and
now
be
constrain
to
say
that
her
conduct
have
be
such
as
to
justify
the
suspicion
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
we
all
suspect
her
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
;
"
and
,
of
course
,
we
suspect
Lord
George
too
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Miss
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
you
know
,
if
I
be
to
lose
my
diamond
,
people
would
suspect
me
just
the
same
,
 
or
perhaps
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
delightful
to
think
that
a
woman
have
steal
her
own
property
,
and
put
all
the
police
into
a
state
of
ferment
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
declare
himself
to
be
heartily
sick
of
the
whole
subject
;
and
Mr.
Grey
,
who
be
a
very
just
man
,
suggest
that
the
evidence
,
as
yet
,
against
anybody
,
be
very
slight
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
it
be
slight
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
more
than
slight
,
it
would
be
just
like
any
other
robbery
,
and
there
would
be
nothing
in
it
.
"
<EOS>
on
the
same
morning
Mrs.
Bonteen
receive
a
second
letter
from
her
friend
Mrs.
Rutter
.
<EOS>
the
Tewett
marriage
have
be
certainly
break
off
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
have
be
very
violent
,
misbehave
himself
grossly
in
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
,
and
Miss
Roanoke
have
declare
that
under
no
circumstance
would
she
ever
speak
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mrs.
Rutter
's
opinion
,
however
,
that
this
violence
have
be
"
put
on
"
by
Sir
Griffin
,
who
be
desirous
of
escape
from
the
marriage
because
of
the
affair
of
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
much
bind
up
with
Lord
George
,
"
say
Mrs.
Rutter
,
"
and
be
afraid
that
he
may
be
implicate
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
in
my
opinion
he
be
quite
right
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
matter
be
tell
to
the
duke
by
Lady
Glencora
and
Madame
Goesler
in
the
recess
of
his
grace
's
private
room
;
for
the
duke
be
now
infirm
,
and
do
not
dine
in
company
unless
the
day
be
very
auspicious
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
evening
he
would
creep
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
on
this
occasion
he
have
a
word
to
say
about
the
Eustace
diamond
to
every
one
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
admit
by
them
all
that
the
robbery
have
be
a
godsend
in
the
way
of
amuse
the
duke
.
"
<EOS>
Would
not
have
her
box
search
,
you
know
,
"
say
the
duke
;
"
that
look
uncommonly
suspicious
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
Lady
Chiltern
,
we
shall
hear
to
-
morrow
morning
something
more
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
dear
duke
,
"
say
Lady
Chiltern
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
dote
old
idiot
!
"
<EOS>
he
reply
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
condition
 
<EOS>
when
such
a
man
as
Barrington
Erle
undertake
to
send
information
to
such
a
correspondent
as
Lady
Glencora
in
reference
to
such
a
matter
as
Lady
Eustace
's
diamond
,
he
be
bind
to
be
full
rather
than
accurate
.
<EOS>
We
may
say
,
indeed
,
that
perfect
accuracy
would
be
detrimental
rather
than
otherwise
,
and
would
tend
to
disperse
that
feeling
of
mystery
which
be
so
gratifying
.
<EOS>
no
suggestion
have
in
truth
be
make
to
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
as
to
the
searching
of
his
lordship
's
box
and
desk
.
<EOS>
that
very
eminent
detective
officer
,
Mr.
Bunfit
,
have
,
however
,
call
upon
Lord
George
more
than
once
,
and
Lord
George
have
declare
very
plainly
that
he
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
explain
to
me
<EOS>
what
it
be
you
want
,
I
will
be
much
oblige
to
you
,
"
Lord
George
have
say
to
Mr.
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
lord
,
"
say
Bunfit
,
"
what
we
want
be
these
diamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
believe
that
I
have
get
them
?
"
  
"
a
man
in
my
situation
,
my
lord
,
never
believe
anything
.
<EOS>
We
have
to
suspect
,
but
we
never
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
suspect
that
I
steal
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
lord
;
 
I
do
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
but
thing
be
very
queer
;
be
not
they
?
"
<EOS>
the
immediate
object
of
Mr.
Bunfit
's
visit
on
this
morning
have
be
to
ascertain
from
Lord
George
whether
it
be
true
that
his
lordship
have
be
with
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
the
jeweller
,
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
in
town
.
<EOS>
no
one
from
the
police
have
as
yet
see
either
Harter
or
Benjamin
in
connexion
with
this
robbery
;
but
it
may
not
be
too
much
to
say
that
the
argus
eye
of
Major
Mackintosh
be
upon
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
's
whole
establishment
,
and
it
be
believe
that
,
if
the
jewel
be
in
London
,
they
be
lock
up
in
some
box
within
that
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
think
more
than
probable
by
Major
Mackintosh
and
his
myrmidon
that
the
jewel
be
already
at
Hamburg
;
and
by
this
time
,
as
the
major
have
explain
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
every
one
of
them
may
have
be
reset
,
 
or
even
recut
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
know
that
Lord
George
have
be
at
the
house
of
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
early
on
the
morning
after
his
return
to
town
,
and
the
ingenuous
Mr.
Bunfit
,
who
,
by
reason
of
his
situation
,
never
believe
anything
and
only
suspect
,
have
express
a
very
strong
opinion
to
Major
Mackintosh
that
the
necklace
have
in
truth
be
transfer
to
the
Jews
on
that
morning
.
<EOS>
that
there
be
nothing
"
too
hot
or
too
heavy
"
for
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
be
quite
a
creed
with
the
police
of
the
west
end
of
London
.
<EOS>
may
it
not
be
well
to
ask
Lord
George
what
he
have
to
say
about
the
visit
?
<EOS>
Should
Lord
George
deny
the
visit
,
such
denial
would
go
far
to
confirm
Mr.
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
the
question
be
ask
,
and
Lord
George
do
not
deny
the
visit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
unfortunately
,
they
hold
acceptance
of
mine
,
"
say
Lord
George
,
"
and
I
be
often
there
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
know
as
they
have
your
lordship
's
name
to
paper
,
"
say
Mr.
Bunfit
,
 
thank
Lord
George
,
however
,
for
his
courtesy
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
understand
that
all
this
would
be
unpleasant
to
Lord
George
,
and
that
he
should
be
indignant
almost
to
madness
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Erle
's
information
,
though
certainly
defective
in
regard
to
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
,
have
be
more
correct
when
he
speak
of
the
lady
.
<EOS>
an
interview
that
be
very
terrible
to
poor
Lizzie
do
take
place
between
her
and
Mr.
Bunfit
in
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
on
Tuesday
,
the
30th
of
January
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
many
interview
between
Lizzie
and
various
member
of
the
police
force
in
reference
to
the
diamond
,
but
the
question
put
to
her
have
always
be
ask
on
the
supposition
that
she
may
have
mislay
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
possible
that
she
may
have
think
that
she
lock
it
up
,
but
have
omit
to
place
it
in
the
box
?
<EOS>
as
long
as
these
question
have
reference
to
a
possible
oversight
in
Scotland
,
 
to
some
carelessness
which
she
may
have
commit
on
the
night
before
she
leave
her
home
,
 
Lizzie
upon
the
whole
seem
rather
to
like
the
idea
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
be
possible
.
<EOS>
She
believe
thoroughly
that
the
diamond
have
be
lock
by
her
in
the
box
,
 
but
she
acknowledge
that
it
may
be
the
case
that
they
have
be
leave
on
one
side
.
<EOS>
this
have
happen
when
the
police
first
begin
to
suspect
that
the
necklace
have
not
be
in
the
box
when
it
be
carry
out
of
the
Carlisle
hotel
,
but
before
it
have
occur
to
them
that
Lord
George
have
be
concern
in
the
robbery
,
and
possibly
Lady
Eustace
herself
.
<EOS>
man
have
be
send
down
from
London
,
of
course
at
considerable
expense
,
and
Portray
Castle
have
be
search
,
with
the
consent
of
its
owner
,
from
the
weathercock
to
the
foundation
-
stone
,
 
much
to
the
consternation
of
Miss
Macnulty
,
and
to
the
delight
of
Andy
Gowran
.
<EOS>
no
trace
of
the
diamond
be
find
,
and
Lizzie
have
so
far
fraternised
with
the
police
.
<EOS>
but
when
Mr.
Bunfit
call
upon
her
,
perhaps
for
the
fifth
or
sixth
time
,
and
suggest
that
he
should
be
allow
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
female
whom
he
have
leave
behind
him
in
the
hall
,
to
search
all
her
ladyship
's
box
,
drawer
,
press
,
and
receptacle
in
London
,
the
thing
take
a
very
different
aspect
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
lady
,
"
say
Mr.
Bunfit
,
excuse
the
peculiar
nature
of
his
request
,
"
it
may
have
get
anywhere
among
your
ladyship
's
thing
,
unbeknownst
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
at
the
time
sit
together
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
the
first
to
protest
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Bunfit
think
that
he
be
go
to
search
her
thing
,
Mr.
Bunfit
be
very
much
mistake
.
<EOS>
what
she
have
suffer
about
this
necklace
<EOS>
no
man
or
woman
know
,
 
and
she
mean
that
there
should
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
opinion
that
the
police
should
have
discover
every
stone
of
it
day
and
day
ago
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
her
house
be
her
own
,
and
she
give
Mr.
Bunfit
to
understand
that
his
repeat
visit
be
not
agreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
when
Mr.
Bunfit
,
without
show
the
slight
displeasure
at
the
evil
thing
say
of
him
,
suggest
that
the
search
should
be
confine
to
the
room
use
exclusively
by
Lady
Eustace
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
absolutely
change
her
view
,
and
recommend
that
he
should
be
allow
to
have
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
moment
the
condition
of
poor
Lizzie
Eustace
be
very
sad
.
<EOS>
He
who
recount
these
detail
have
scorn
to
have
a
secret
between
himself
and
his
reader
.
<EOS>
the
diamond
be
at
this
moment
lock
up
within
Lizzie
's
desk
.
<EOS>
for
the
last
three
week
they
have
be
there
,
 
if
it
may
not
be
more
truly
say
that
they
be
lie
heavily
on
her
heart
.
<EOS>
for
three
week
have
her
mind
with
constant
stretch
be
work
on
that
point
,
 
whither
<EOS>
should
she
take
the
diamond
,
and
what
should
she
do
with
them
?
<EOS>
a
certain
very
wonderful
strength
she
do
possess
,
or
she
could
not
have
endure
the
weight
of
so
terrible
an
anxiety
;
but
from
day
to
day
the
thing
become
bad
and
bad
with
her
<EOS>
,
as
gradually
she
perceive
that
suspicion
be
attach
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Should
she
confide
the
secret
to
Lord
George
,
or
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
or
to
Frank
Greystock
?
<EOS>
She
think
she
could
have
bear
it
all
if
only
some
one
would
have
bear
it
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
moment
come
in
which
such
confidence
may
be
make
,
her
courage
fail
her
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
she
see
frequently
;
but
he
be
unsympathetic
and
almost
rough
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
he
also
be
suspect
,
and
she
be
almost
disposed
to
think
that
he
have
plan
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
if
the
robbery
have
be
his
handiwork
,
it
be
not
singular
that
he
should
be
unsympathetic
with
the
owner
and
probable
holder
of
the
prey
which
he
have
miss
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
Lizzie
think
that
if
he
would
have
be
soft
with
her
,
like
a
dear
,
good
,
genuine
Corsair
,
for
half
an
hour
,
she
would
have
tell
him
all
,
and
place
the
necklace
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
moment
in
which
she
almost
resolve
to
tell
her
secret
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
She
have
steal
nothing
;
 
<EOS>
so
she
aver
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
intend
only
to
defend
and
save
her
own
property
.
<EOS>
even
the
lie
that
she
have
tell
,
and
the
telling
of
which
be
continue
from
day
to
day
,
have
in
a
measure
be
force
upon
her
by
circumstance
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
sympathise
with
her
in
that
feeling
which
have
prevent
her
from
speak
the
truth
when
first
the
fact
of
the
robbery
be
make
known
to
herself
in
her
own
bedroom
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
a
lady
who
tell
many
lie
,
as
Lizzie
know
well
,
 
and
surely
could
not
be
horrify
at
a
lie
tell
in
such
circumstance
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
in
Lizzie
's
nature
to
trust
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
tell
Lord
George
,
 
and
that
would
destroy
everything
.
<EOS>
when
she
think
of
confide
everything
to
her
cousin
,
it
be
always
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
the
idea
become
dreadful
to
her
as
soon
as
he
be
present
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
dare
to
own
to
him
that
she
have
swear
falsely
to
the
magistrate
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
burthen
have
to
be
bear
,
increase
every
hour
in
weight
,
and
the
poor
creature
's
back
be
not
broad
enough
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
the
necklace
every
wake
minute
,
and
dream
of
it
when
she
sleep
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
keep
herself
from
unlock
her
desk
and
look
at
it
twenty
time
a
day
,
although
she
know
the
peril
of
such
nervous
solicitude
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
only
rid
herself
of
it
altogether
,
she
be
sure
now
that
she
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
would
throw
it
into
the
ocean
fathom
deep
,
if
only
she
could
find
herself
alone
upon
the
ocean
.
<EOS>
but
she
feel
that
,
let
her
go
where
she
may
,
she
would
be
watch
.
<EOS>
She
may
declare
to
-
morrow
her
intention
of
go
to
Ireland
,
 
or
,
for
that
matter
,
to
America
.
<EOS>
but
,
be
she
to
do
so
,
some
horrid
policeman
would
be
on
her
track
.
<EOS>
the
iron
box
have
be
a
terrible
nuisance
to
her
;
 
but
the
iron
box
have
be
as
nothing
compare
to
the
necklace
lock
up
in
her
desk
.
<EOS>
from
day
to
day
she
meditate
a
plan
of
take
the
thing
out
into
the
street
,
and
drop
it
in
the
dark
;
but
she
be
sure
that
,
be
she
to
do
so
,
some
one
would
have
watch
her
while
she
drop
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
unwilling
to
trust
her
old
friend
Mr.
Benjamin
;
but
in
these
day
her
favourite
scheme
be
to
offer
the
diamond
for
sale
to
him
at
some
very
low
price
.
<EOS>
if
he
would
help
her
they
may
surely
be
get
out
of
their
present
hiding
-
place
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
any
man
would
be
powerful
to
help
,
if
there
be
any
man
whom
she
could
trust
.
<EOS>
in
furtherance
of
this
scheme
she
go
so
far
as
to
break
a
brooch
,
 
a
favourite
brooch
of
her
own
,
 
in
order
that
she
may
have
an
excuse
for
call
at
the
jeweller
"
.
<EOS>
but
even
this
she
postpone
from
day
to
day
.
<EOS>
circumstance
,
as
they
have
occur
,
have
teach
her
to
believe
that
the
police
could
not
insist
on
break
open
her
desk
unless
some
evidence
could
be
bring
against
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
evidence
,
and
her
desk
be
so
far
safe
.
<EOS>
but
the
same
circumstance
have
make
her
understand
that
she
be
already
suspect
of
some
intrigue
with
reference
to
the
diamond
,
 
though
of
what
she
be
suspect
she
do
not
clearly
perceive
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
she
could
divine
the
thought
of
her
enemy
,
they
do
not
seem
to
suppose
that
the
diamond
be
in
her
possession
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
believe
by
those
enemy
that
they
have
pass
into
the
hand
of
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
her
enemy
be
on
a
scent
so
false
,
may
it
not
be
good
that
she
should
remain
quiet
?
  
<EOS>
but
all
the
ingenuity
,
the
concentrated
force
,
and
train
experience
of
the
police
of
London
would
surely
be
too
great
and
powerful
for
her
in
the
long
run
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
hope
to
keep
her
secret
and
the
diamond
till
they
should
acknowledge
themselves
to
be
baffle
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
be
aware
of
a
morbid
desire
on
her
own
part
to
tell
the
secret
,
 
of
a
desire
that
amount
almost
to
a
disease
.
<EOS>
It
would
soon
burst
her
bosom
open
,
unless
she
could
share
her
knowledge
with
some
one
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
as
she
think
of
it
all
,
she
tell
herself
that
she
have
no
friend
so
fast
and
true
as
to
justify
such
confidence
.
<EOS>
She
be
ill
with
anxiety
,
and
,
 
bad
than
that
<EOS>
,
 
Mrs.
Carbuncle
know
that
she
be
ill
.
<EOS>
It
be
acknowledge
between
them
that
this
affair
of
the
necklace
be
so
terrible
as
to
make
a
woman
ill
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
at
present
have
be
gracious
enough
to
admit
so
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
but
may
it
not
be
probable
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
come
to
suspect
that
she
do
not
know
the
whole
secret
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
already
,
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
say
a
little
word
or
two
which
have
be
unpleasant
.
  
<EOS>
Such
be
Lizzie
's
condition
when
Mr.
Bunfit
come
,
with
his
authoritative
request
to
be
allow
to
inspect
Lizzie
's
box
,
 
and
when
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
have
secure
her
own
privacy
,
express
her
opinion
that
Mr.
Bunfit
should
be
allow
to
do
as
he
desire
.
   
<EOS>
Bunfit
and
Gager
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
word
be
out
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
mouth
,
 
those
ill
-
natured
word
in
which
she
express
her
assent
to
Mr.
Bunfit
's
proposition
that
a
search
should
be
make
after
the
diamond
among
all
the
possession
of
Lady
Eustace
which
be
now
lodge
in
her
own
house
,
 
<EOS>
poor
Lizzie
's
courage
desert
her
entirely
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
very
courageous
;
for
,
though
her
power
of
endurance
have
sometimes
nearly
desert
her
,
though
her
heart
have
often
fail
her
,
still
she
have
go
on
and
have
endure
and
be
silent
.
<EOS>
to
endure
and
to
be
silent
in
her
position
do
require
great
courage
.
<EOS>
She
be
all
alone
in
her
misery
,
and
could
see
no
way
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
diamond
be
heavy
as
a
load
of
lead
within
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
have
persevere
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
she
hear
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
word
,
her
courage
fail
her
.
<EOS>
there
come
some
obstruction
in
her
throat
,
so
that
she
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
She
feel
as
though
her
heart
be
break
.
<EOS>
She
put
out
both
her
hand
and
could
not
draw
them
back
again
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
be
betray
herself
by
her
weakness
.
<EOS>
She
could
just
hear
the
man
explain
that
the
search
be
merely
a
thing
of
ceremony
,
 
just
to
satisfy
everybody
that
there
be
no
mistake
;
 
and
then
she
faint
.
<EOS>
so
far
,
Barrington
Erle
be
correct
in
the
information
give
by
him
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
press
one
hand
against
her
heart
,
gasp
for
breath
,
and
then
fall
back
upon
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
could
have
do
nothing
better
.
<EOS>
have
the
fainting
be
counterfeit
,
the
measure
would
have
show
ability
.
<EOS>
but
the
fainting
be
altogether
true
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
first
,
and
then
Mr.
Bunfit
,
hurry
from
their
seat
to
help
her
.
<EOS>
to
neither
of
them
do
it
occur
for
a
moment
that
the
fit
be
false
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
whole
thing
have
be
too
much
for
her
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
severely
,
ring
the
bell
at
the
same
time
for
further
aid
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
,
 
mum
;
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
We
have
to
see
a
deal
of
this
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
just
a
little
air
,
if
you
please
,
mum
,
 
and
as
much
water
as'd
go
to
christen
a
babby
.
<EOS>
that
be
always
good
,
mum
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
stand
on
one
side
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
as
she
stretch
Lizzie
on
the
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
mum
,
"
say
Bunfit
,
stand
erect
by
the
wall
,
but
not
show
the
slight
disposition
to
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
go
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
loudly
and
very
severely
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
just
stay
and
see
her
come
to
,
mum
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
do
her
a
morsel
of
harm
,
mum
.
<EOS>
sometimes
they
faint
at
the
very
fust
sight
of
such
as
we
;
but
we
have
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
a
little
more
air
,
if
you
could
,
mum
;
 
and
just
dash
the
water
on
in
drop
like
.
<EOS>
They
feel
a
drop
more
than
they
would
a
bucketful
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
when
they
come
to
they
have
not
to
change
theirselve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bunfit
's
advice
,
found
on
much
experience
,
be
good
,
and
Lizzie
gradually
come
to
herself
and
open
her
eye
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
clutch
at
her
breast
,
feel
for
her
key
.
<EOS>
She
find
it
unmoved
,
but
before
her
finger
have
recognise
the
touch
,
her
quick
mind
have
tell
her
how
wrong
the
movement
have
be
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
lose
upon
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
but
not
on
Mr.
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
at
once
think
that
she
have
the
diamond
in
her
desk
;
but
he
feel
almost
sure
that
there
be
something
in
her
possession
,
 
probably
some
document
,
 
which
,
if
find
,
would
place
him
on
the
track
of
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
compel
a
search
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
ladyship'll
soon
be
well
,
"
say
Bunfit
graciously
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
endeavour
to
smile
as
she
express
her
assent
to
this
proposition
.
<EOS>
"
as
I
be
a
saying
to
the
eld
lady
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
say
to
who
,
sir
?
"
exclaim
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
rise
up
in
wrath
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
elder
,
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
I
be
a
venture
to
explain
,
these
fit
of
fainting
come
often
in
our
way
.
<EOS>
thief
,
mum
,
 
that
is
,
the
regular
,
 
do
not
mind
us
a
bit
,
and
the
woman
be
more
hardeneder
than
the
man
;
but
when
we
have
to
speak
to
a
lady
,
it
be
so
often
that
she
go
off
like
that
!
<EOS>
I
have
know
"
<EOS>
em
do
it
just
at
be
look
at
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
you
think
,
sir
,
that
you
would
better
leave
us
now
?
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
have
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
fit
for
nothing
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
disturb
your
ladyship
the
least
in
life
,
"
say
Mr.
Bunfit
,
"
if
you
will
only
just
let
us
have
your
key
.
<EOS>
Your
servant
can
be
with
us
,
and
we
will
not
move
one
tittle
of
anything
.
"
<EOS>
but
Lizzie
,
though
she
be
still
suffer
that
ineffable
sickness
which
always
accompany
and
follow
a
real
fainting
-
fit
,
would
not
surrender
her
key
.
<EOS>
already
have
an
excuse
for
not
do
so
occur
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
for
a
while
she
seem
to
hesitate
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
demand
it
,
Lady
Eustace
,
"
say
Mr.
Bunfit
,
"
but
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
<EOS>
,
I
do
think
it
will
look
well
for
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
take
no
step
without
consult
my
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
"
say
Lizzie
;
and
have
thought
of
this
she
adhere
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
detective
supply
her
with
many
reason
for
give
up
her
key
,
allege
that
it
would
do
no
harm
,
and
that
her
refusal
would
create
infinite
suspicion
.
<EOS>
but
Lizzie
have
form
her
answer
and
stick
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
always
consult
her
cousin
,
and
always
act
upon
his
advice
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
caution
her
not
to
take
any
step
without
his
sanction
.
<EOS>
She
would
do
nothing
till
he
consent
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Bunfit
would
see
Mr.
Greystock
,
and
if
Mr.
Greystock
would
come
to
her
and
tell
her
to
submit
,
 
she
would
submit
.
<EOS>
Ill
as
she
be
,
she
could
be
obstinate
,
and
Bunfit
leave
the
house
without
have
be
able
to
finger
that
key
<EOS>
which
he
feel
sure
that
Lady
Eustace
carry
somewhere
on
her
person
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
walk
back
to
his
own
quarter
in
Scotland
Yard
,
Bunfit
be
by
no
mean
dissatisfy
with
his
morning
's
work
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
expect
to
find
anything
with
Lady
Eustace
,
and
,
when
she
faint
,
have
not
hope
to
be
allow
to
search
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
now
sure
that
her
ladyship
be
possess
,
at
any
rate
,
of
some
guilty
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Bunfit
be
one
of
those
who
,
almost
from
the
first
,
have
believe
that
the
box
be
empty
when
take
out
of
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
"
stone
like
them
must
turn
up
more
or
less
,
"
be
Bunfit
's
great
argument
.
<EOS>
that
the
police
should
already
have
find
the
stone
themselves
be
not
perhaps
probable
;
but
have
any
ordinary
thief
have
them
in
their
hand
,
they
could
not
have
be
pass
on
without
leave
a
trace
behind
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
opinion
that
the
box
have
be
open
and
the
door
cut
by
the
instrumentality
and
concurrence
of
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
,
 
with
the
assistance
of
some
well
-
skilled
mechanical
thief
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
make
out
of
the
tall
footman
;
 
indeed
,
the
tall
footman
have
already
be
set
at
liberty
,
although
he
be
know
to
have
evil
associate
;
and
the
tall
footman
be
now
loud
in
demand
compensation
for
the
injury
do
to
him
.
<EOS>
many
believe
that
the
tall
footman
have
be
concern
in
the
matter
,
 
many
,
that
is
,
among
the
experienced
craftsman
of
the
police
force
.
<EOS>
Bunfit
think
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Bunfit
believe
that
the
diamond
be
now
either
in
the
possession
of
Lord
George
or
of
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
that
they
have
be
hand
over
to
Lord
George
to
save
them
from
Messrs.
Camperdown
and
the
lawsuit
,
and
that
Lord
George
and
the
lady
be
lover
.
<EOS>
the
lady
's
conduct
at
their
last
interview
,
her
fit
of
fainting
,
and
her
clutch
for
the
key
,
all
confirm
Bunfit
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
but
unfortunately
for
Bunfit
he
be
almost
alone
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
in
the
force
,
 
high
in
their
profession
as
detective
,
 
who
avow
that
certainly
two
very
experienced
and
well
-
know
thief
have
be
concern
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
that
a
certain
Mr.
Smiler
have
be
there
,
 
a
gentleman
for
whom
the
whole
police
of
London
entertain
a
feeling
which
approach
to
veneration
,
and
that
most
diminutive
of
full
-
grown
thief
,
Billy
Cann
,
 
most
diminutive
but
at
the
same
time
most
expert
,
 
be
not
doubt
by
some
mind
which
be
apt
to
doubt
till
conviction
have
become
certainty
.
<EOS>
the
traveller
who
have
leave
the
Scotch
train
at
dumfrie
have
be
a
very
small
man
,
and
it
be
a
know
fact
that
Mr.
Smiler
have
leave
London
by
train
,
from
the
Euston
Square
station
,
on
the
day
before
that
on
which
Lizzie
and
her
party
have
reach
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
if
Mr.
Smiler
and
Billy
Cann
have
both
be
at
work
at
the
hotel
,
then
,
 
so
argue
they
who
oppose
the
Bunfit
theory
,
 
it
be
hardly
conceivable
that
the
robbery
should
have
be
arrange
by
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
accord
to
the
Bunfit
theory
,
the
only
thing
need
by
the
conspirator
have
be
that
the
diamond
should
be
hand
over
by
Lady
Eustace
to
Lord
George
in
such
a
way
as
to
escape
suspicion
that
such
transfer
have
be
make
.
<EOS>
this
may
have
be
do
with
very
little
trouble
,
 
by
simply
leave
the
box
empty
,
with
the
key
in
it
.
<EOS>
the
door
of
the
bedroom
have
be
open
by
skilful
professional
man
,
and
the
box
have
be
force
by
the
use
of
tool
which
none
but
professional
gentleman
would
possess
.
<EOS>
be
it
probable
that
Lord
George
would
have
commit
himself
with
such
man
,
and
incur
the
very
heavy
expense
of
pay
for
their
service
,
when
he
be
,
 
accord
to
the
Bunfit
theory
,
 
able
to
get
at
the
diamond
without
any
such
trouble
,
danger
,
and
expenditure
?
<EOS>
there
be
a
young
detective
in
the
force
,
very
clever
,
 
almost
too
clever
,
and
certainly
a
little
too
fast
,
 
Gager
by
name
,
who
declare
that
the
Bunfit
theory
"
warn't
<EOS>
on
the
card
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
accord
to
Gager
's
information
,
Smiler
be
at
this
moment
a
break
-
hearted
man
,
 
range
between
mad
indignation
and
suicidal
despondency
,
because
he
have
be
treat
with
treachery
in
some
direction
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gager
be
as
fully
convince
as
Bunfit
that
the
diamond
have
not
be
in
the
box
.
<EOS>
there
be
bitter
,
rage
,
heart
-
break
disappointment
about
the
diamond
in
more
quarter
than
one
.
<EOS>
that
there
have
be
a
double
robbery
Gager
be
quite
sure
;
 
or
rather
a
robbery
in
which
two
set
of
thief
have
be
concern
,
and
in
which
one
set
have
be
dupe
by
the
other
set
.
<EOS>
in
this
affair
Mr.
Smiler
and
poor
little
Billy
Cann
have
be
the
dupe
.
<EOS>
so
far
Gager
's
mind
have
arrive
at
certainty
.
<EOS>
but
then
how
have
they
be
dupe
,
and
who
have
dupe
them
?
<EOS>
and
who
have
employ
them
?
<EOS>
such
a
robbery
would
hardly
have
be
arrange
and
execute
except
on
commission
.
<EOS>
even
Mr.
Smiler
would
not
have
burthen
himself
with
such
diamond
without
know
what
to
do
with
them
,
and
what
he
should
get
for
them
.
<EOS>
that
they
be
intend
ultimately
for
the
hand
of
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
Gager
almost
believe
.
<EOS>
and
Gager
be
incline
to
think
that
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
 
or
rather
Mr.
Benjamin
,
for
Mr.
Harter
himself
be
almost
too
old
for
work
require
so
very
great
mental
activity
,
 
that
Mr.
Benjamin
,
fear
the
honesty
of
his
executive
officer
Mr.
Smiler
,
have
be
splendidly
treacherous
to
his
subordinate
.
<EOS>
Gager
have
not
quite
complete
his
theory
;
but
he
be
very
firm
on
one
great
point
,
 
that
the
thief
at
Carlisle
have
be
genuine
thief
,
think
that
they
be
steal
the
diamond
,
and
find
their
mistake
out
when
the
box
have
be
open
by
them
under
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
"
who
have
"
em
,
then
?
"
ask
Bunfit
of
his
young
brother
,
in
a
disparaging
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
yes
;
who
"
ave
"
em
?
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
say
,
who
"
ave
"
em
?
<EOS>
suppose
"
e
"
ave
"
em
.
"
<EOS>
the
"
he
"
allude
to
by
Gager
be
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
.
"
<EOS>
but
law
,
Bunfit
,
they
be
go
 
week
ago
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
,
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
"
this
have
occur
before
the
intend
search
among
poor
Lizzie
's
box
,
but
Bunfit
's
theory
have
not
be
shake
.
<EOS>
Bunfit
could
see
all
round
his
own
theory
.
<EOS>
It
be
whole
,
and
the
motive
as
well
as
the
operation
of
the
person
concern
be
explain
by
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
Gager
theory
only
go
to
show
what
have
not
be
do
,
and
offer
no
explanation
of
the
accomplished
scheme
.
<EOS>
then
Bunfit
go
a
little
further
in
his
theory
,
not
disdain
to
accept
something
from
Gager
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Lord
George
have
engage
these
man
,
and
have
afterwards
find
it
practicable
to
get
the
diamond
without
their
assistance
.
<EOS>
on
one
great
point
all
concern
in
the
inquiry
be
in
unison
,
 
that
the
diamond
have
not
be
in
the
box
when
it
be
carry
out
of
the
bedroom
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
the
great
point
of
difference
consist
in
this
,
that
whereas
Gager
be
sure
that
the
robbery
when
commit
have
be
genuine
,
Bunfit
be
of
opinion
that
the
box
have
be
first
open
,
and
then
take
out
of
the
hotel
in
order
that
the
police
may
be
put
on
a
wrong
track
.
  
<EOS>
the
matter
be
become
very
important
.
<EOS>
two
or
three
of
the
lead
newspaper
have
first
hint
at
and
then
openly
condemn
the
incompetence
and
slowness
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
such
censure
,
as
we
all
know
,
be
very
common
,
and
in
nine
case
out
of
ten
it
be
unjust
.
<EOS>
They
who
write
it
probably
know
but
little
of
the
circumstance
;
 
and
,
in
speak
of
a
failure
here
and
a
failure
there
,
make
no
reference
to
the
numerous
success
,
which
be
so
customary
as
to
partake
of
the
nature
of
routine
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
in
regard
to
all
public
matter
,
 
army
matter
,
navy
matter
,
poor
-
law
matter
,
and
post
-
office
matter
.
<EOS>
day
after
day
,
and
almost
every
day
,
one
meet
censure
which
be
feel
to
be
unjust
;
 
but
the
general
result
of
all
this
injustice
be
increase
efficiency
.
<EOS>
the
coach
do
go
the
faster
because
of
the
whip
in
the
coachman
's
hand
,
though
the
horse
drive
may
never
have
deserve
the
thong
.
<EOS>
in
this
matter
of
the
Eustace
diamond
the
police
have
be
very
active
;
but
they
have
be
unsuccessful
,
and
have
consequently
be
abuse
.
<EOS>
the
robbery
be
now
more
than
three
week
old
.
<EOS>
property
to
the
amount
of
ten
thousand
pound
have
be
abstract
,
and
as
yet
the
police
have
not
even
form
an
assured
opinion
on
the
subject
!
<EOS>
have
the
same
thing
occur
in
New
York
or
Paris
every
diamond
would
by
this
time
have
be
trace
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
assertion
make
,
and
the
police
be
instigate
to
new
exertion
.
<EOS>
Bunfit
would
have
jeopardise
his
right
hand
,
and
Gager
his
life
,
to
get
at
the
secret
.
<EOS>
even
Major
Mackintosh
be
anxious
.
  
<EOS>
the
fact
of
the
claim
make
by
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
of
the
bill
which
have
be
file
in
Chancery
for
the
recovery
of
the
diamond
,
be
of
course
widely
know
,
and
add
much
to
the
general
interest
and
complexity
.
<EOS>
It
be
aver
that
Mr.
Camperdown
's
determination
to
get
the
diamond
have
be
very
energetic
,
and
Lady
Eustace
's
determination
to
keep
them
equally
so
.
<EOS>
wonderful
story
be
tell
of
Lizzie
's
courage
,
energy
,
and
resolution
.
<EOS>
there
be
hardly
a
lawyer
of
repute
but
take
up
the
question
,
and
have
an
opinion
as
to
Lizzie
's
right
to
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
the
Attorney
and
Solicitor
-
General
be
dead
against
her
,
assert
that
the
diamond
certainly
do
not
pass
to
her
under
the
will
,
and
could
not
have
become
her
by
gift
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
member
of
a
liberal
government
,
and
of
course
anti
-
lizzieite
.
<EOS>
gentleman
who
be
equal
to
them
in
learning
,
who
have
hold
office
equally
high
,
be
distinctly
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
may
probably
claim
the
jewel
as
paraphernalia
properly
appertain
to
her
rank
;
 
in
which
claim
the
bestowal
of
them
by
her
husband
would
no
doubt
assist
her
.
<EOS>
and
to
these
gentleman
,
 
who
be
Lizzieites
and
of
course
conservative
in
politic
,
 
<EOS>
it
be
by
no
means
clear
that
the
diamond
do
not
pass
to
her
by
will
.
<EOS>
if
it
could
be
show
that
the
diamond
have
be
lately
keep
in
Scotland
,
the
ex
-
Attorney
-
General
think
that
they
would
so
pass
.
<EOS>
all
which
question
,
now
that
the
jewel
have
be
lose
,
be
discuss
openly
,
and
add
greatly
to
the
anxiety
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
both
Lizzieites
and
anti
-
Lizzieites
be
dispose
to
think
that
Lizzie
be
very
clever
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
in
these
day
take
up
his
cousin
's
part
altogether
in
good
faith
.
<EOS>
He
entertain
not
the
slight
suspicion
that
she
be
deceive
him
in
regard
to
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
that
the
robbery
have
be
a
bona
-
fide
robbery
,
and
that
Lizzie
have
lose
her
treasure
,
be
to
him
beyond
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
have
gradually
convince
himself
that
Mr.
Camperdown
be
wrong
in
his
claim
,
and
be
strongly
of
opinion
that
Lord
Fawn
have
disgrace
himself
by
his
conduct
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
when
he
now
hear
,
as
he
do
hear
,
that
some
undefined
suspicion
be
attach
to
his
cousin
,
 
and
when
he
hear
also
,
as
unfortunately
he
do
hear
,
 
that
Lord
Fawn
have
encourage
that
suspicion
<EOS>
,
he
be
very
irate
,
and
say
grievous
thing
of
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
to
be
the
extremity
of
cruelty
that
suspicion
should
be
attach
to
his
cousin
because
she
have
be
rob
of
her
jewel
.
<EOS>
He
be
among
those
who
be
most
severe
in
their
denunciation
of
the
police
,
 
and
be
the
more
so
,
because
he
have
hear
it
assert
that
the
necklace
have
not
in
truth
be
steal
.
<EOS>
He
busy
himself
very
much
in
the
matter
,
and
even
interrogate
John
Eustace
as
to
his
intention
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
say
Eustace
,
"
if
you
hate
those
diamond
as
much
as
I
do
,
you
would
never
mention
them
again
.
"
<EOS>
Greystock
declare
that
this
expression
of
aversion
to
the
subject
may
be
all
very
well
for
Mr.
Eustace
,
but
that
he
find
himself
bind
to
defend
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
defend
her
against
me
,
"
say
Eustace
,
"
for
I
do
not
attack
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
say
a
word
against
her
.
<EOS>
I
go
down
to
Portray
when
she
ask
me
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
she
be
perfectly
welcome
to
wear
the
necklace
,
if
she
can
get
it
back
again
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
make
or
meddle
in
the
matter
one
way
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
,
after
that
,
go
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
but
he
could
get
no
satisfaction
from
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
would
only
say
that
he
have
a
duty
to
do
,
and
that
he
must
do
it
.
<EOS>
on
the
matter
of
the
robbery
he
refuse
to
give
an
opinion
.
<EOS>
that
be
in
the
hand
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
Should
the
diamond
be
recover
,
he
would
,
of
course
,
claim
them
on
behalf
of
the
estate
.
<EOS>
in
his
opinion
,
whether
the
diamond
be
recover
or
not
,
Lady
Eustace
be
responsible
to
the
estate
for
their
value
.
<EOS>
in
opposition
,
first
to
the
entreaty
,
and
then
to
the
demand
of
her
late
husband
's
family
,
she
have
insist
on
absurdly
carry
about
with
her
an
enormous
amount
of
property
which
do
not
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
opine
that
she
must
pay
for
the
lost
diamond
out
of
her
jointure
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
in
a
huff
,
declare
that
,
as
far
as
he
could
see
,
the
diamond
belong
to
his
cousin
;
 
in
answer
to
which
Mr.
Camperdown
suggest
that
the
question
be
one
for
the
decision
of
the
Vice
-
Chancellor
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
find
that
he
could
do
nothing
with
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
feel
that
he
could
wreak
his
vengeance
only
on
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
Bunfit

when

It

my
mind
that
it

get

her

either
the

<EOS>
during

this

Lucinda
Roanoke
be
engage
to
marry
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
and
the
lover
be
an
occasional
visitor
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
as
anxious
as
ever
that
the
marriage
should
be
celebrate
on
the
appoint
day
,
and
though
there
have
be
repeat
quarrel
,
nothing
have
as
yet
take
place
to
make
her
despond
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
would
make
some
offensive
speech
;
Lucinda
would
tell
him
that
she
have
no
desire
ever
to
see
him
again
;
and
then
the
baronet
,
usually
under
the
instigation
of
Lord
George
,
would
make
some
awkward
apology
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
whose
life
at
this
period
be
not
a
pleasant
one
,
 
would
behave
on
such
occasion
with
great
patience

and
sometimes
with
great
courage

<EOS>
Lizzie
,
who
in
her
present
emergency
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
lose
the
assistance
of
any
friend

be
soft
and
graceful
,

even
gracious
,
to
the
bear
.
<EOS>
the
bear
himself
certainly
seem
to
desire
the
marriage
,
though
he
would
so
often
give
offence
which
make
any
prospect
of
a
marriage
almost
impossible
.
<EOS>
but
with
Sir
Griffin
,
when
the
prize
seem
to
be
lose
,
it
again
become
valuable
.
<EOS>
He
would
talk
about
his
passionate
love
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
to
Lizzie
,
 
and
then
,
when
thing
have
be
make
straight
for
him
,
he
would
insult
them
,
and
neglect
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
to
Lucinda
herself
,
however
,
he
would
rarely
dare
to
say
such
word
as
he
use
daily
to
the
other
two
lady
in

<EOS>
what
could
have
be
the

's
own

his
future
married
life
,
how
can
any
reader
be
make
to
understand
,
or
any
writer
adequately
describe
!
<EOS>
He
must
have
know
that
the
woman
despise
him
,
and
hate
him
.
<EOS>
in
the
very
bottom
of
his

he
fear
her

<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
of
other
pleasure
from

society
than
what
may
arise
to
him
from
the
pride
of
have
marry
a
beautiful

<EOS>
have
she
show
the
slight
fondness
for

the
slight
fear

lose

the
slight
feeling
that
she

he
would

down

yes

<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
do
not
exactly
speak
such
word
as
these

but
he
act
them
.
<EOS>
Lucinda
would
bear
his
presence
,
 
sit
apart
from
him
,
silent
,
imperious
,
but
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
People
say
that
she
become
more
handsome
from
day
to
day
,
and
she
do
so
,
in
spite
of
her
agony
.
<EOS>
Hers
be
a
face
which
could
stand
such
condition
of
the
heart
without
fade
or
sink
under
it
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
weep
,
or
lose
her
colour
,
or
become
thin

<EOS>
the
pretty
softness
of
a
girl

delicate
feminine
weakness

no

expect

Sir
Griffin

in
the
early
day
of

acquaintance

have
find
her
to
be
a
woman
with
a
character
for
beauty
,
 
and
she
be
now
more
beautiful
than
ever

<EOS>
He
probably
think
that
he
love
her
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
he
be
determine
that
he
would
marry
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
express
himself
more
than
once
as
very
angry
about
this
affair
of
the
jewel

<EOS>
He
have
tell
Mrs.
Carbuncle
that
her
inmate
,
Lady
Eustace

be
suspect

that
it
may
be
well
that
Lady
Eustace
should
be
 
be
make

in

but
it
do
not
suit
Mrs.

that
Lady

should
be
make

do
it
suit
Lord

Bruce
Carruthers

<EOS>
Lord
George
,
at
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
instance
,
have
snub
Sir
Griffin
more
than
once
,
and
then
it
come
to
pass
that
he
be
snub
yet
again
more
violently
than
before

<EOS>
He
be
at
the

nonsense

no

Sir
Griffin

so

the
other
nonsense

you
mean
to
tell
us
that
you
believe
that
Lady
Eustace
steal
her
own
diamond
?

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

the
use
of
have
her
here

have
a
right
to
object
to
it

Sir
Griffin

Lucinda

well
;
 
yes
,
of
course
;
if
we

with
all
my

away

at
that
moment
Lord

show
into
the
room

Miss
Roanoke
continue
speak
,
determine
that
Lord
George
should
know
how
the
bear

conduct

Sir
Griffin

say
that

Lady
Eustace
out
of

house

not
quite
that

an
attempt

quite
that
,
"

Lucinda
.

I
do
not
suppose
that

suspect
poor
Lady
Eustace

the
suspicion

mind
your

Lord
George

better

wonder
Mrs.
Carbuncle

not
turn
you
out
of
the
room

such

nobody

wife

say
that
young
lady
;
 
upon
which
Sir
Griffin
leave
the
room
,
mutter
some
word
which
may
have
be
,
perhaps
,
intend
for
an
adieu

<EOS>
immediately
after
this
,
Lizzie
come
in
,
move
slowly
,
but
without
a
sound
,
like
a
ghost

with
pale
cheek

dishevel
hair

and
that
weary
,
worn
look
of
illness

be
become
customary
with
her

She
greet
Lord
George
with
a
faint
attempt
at
a
smile

seat
herself
in

corner
of
a
sofa

She
ask
whether
he
have

tell
the
story
of
the

search

bade
her
friend

me

up

railway

this
be
not

with
much
courtesy

Lord
George
have
drop
that
customary
chivalry
of
manner
which
,
in
ordinary
life
,
make
it
to
be
quite
out
of
the
question
that
a
man
shall
be
uncivil
to
a
woman

<EOS>
He
have
escape
from
conventional
usage
into
rough
,
truthful
speech

under
stress
from
the
extremity
of
the
hardship
to
which
he
have
be
subject

<EOS>
and
the
woman
understand
it
and
appreciate
it
,

like
it
rather
than
otherwise

<EOS>
to
Lizzie
it
seem
fitting
that
a
Corsair
so
circumstance
should
be
as
uncivil
as
he
please
;

Mrs.

have
long
be
accustomed
to
her

mood

I
do

I
be

indifferent

ordinary
tittle

tattle

rhinoceros

,
by
George
,
 
when

come
to
steal
ten
thousand
pound

the
delicate
attention

vulnerable

when
I
get
up
in

half
feel

lock
up

better

much

so
he
tell
me

now

in
all
London

do
not

great
rascal
than
Benjamin

<EOS>

I
do
not

I
do
;

with

rascal

money
dealing

seven

He
have
cash
bill
for

have
my

to
bill

Sir

too

Mrs.

He
either

his

such
an
opinion

a

greasy

israelitish
smile

her
head

yesterday
about

at

the
thief

the
necklace
soon

word

no

no
,
no

he
say
,

seem
quite
to
enjoy
the
joke

<EOS>
if
he
be
get
them
himself

he
can
not
think
that
I
have
them
;

if
he
have
not

I
do
not
doubt

believe

I
will
tell

myself

do

I
have
get

do
not

so

it

again
laugh

must
have
your
suspicion

what
do
you

Lady
Eustace

what
to

Mr.

it

the
Lord
Chancellor
,

Lord
George

one
be
just
as
likely
as
the
other

I
wish
I
could
get
at
what
you
really
think

<EOS>
the
whole
thing
would
be
so
complete
if
all
you
three
suspect
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
get
out
of
it
all
by
go
to
Paris
or
Kamschatka
,
as
I
should
have
half
a
dozen
detective
on
my
heel
wherever
I
go

<EOS>
I
must
brazen
it
out
here
;
and
the
bad
of
it
be
,
that
I
feel
that
a
look
of
guilt
be
creep
over
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
sort
of
conviction
grow
upon
me
that
I
shall
be
take
up
and
try
,
and
that
a
jury
will
find
me
guilty

dream
about
it

as
be
probable
,
 
it
drive
me
mad
,
I
be
sure
that
I
shall
accuse
myself
in
my
madness

<EOS>
there
be
a
fascination
about
it
that
I
can
not
explain

escape

I
go
on

how
I
would
have
do
it

I
do

it

I
spend
hour
in
calculate
how
much
I
would
have
realise
,

where
I
would
have
find
my
market

<EOS>
I
could

myself
from

Benjamin
the

much
they
would

worth

him

give

up

the
Corsair

repeat
Mr.

manner
so
well

make
Lizzie
shudder

while

there

Mrs.

I
think
not

<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
quite
intimate
with
Mr.
Benjamin
,
and
go
on
at
once
about
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
Benjamin
say
that
they
would
make
their
way
over
to
Paris
,
and
that
he
would
hear
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
find
myself
get
quite
intimate
with
Mr.
Gager
,
who
seem
hardly
to
scruple
at
show
that
he
think
that
Benjamin

I

confederate

<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
have
offer
four
hundred
pound
reward
for
the
jewel

to
be
pay
on
their
surrender
to
the
hand
of
Mr.

that

they
would

give
up
at

for
that
sum

<EOS>
"
that
be
true

I
suppose

Mrs.

how
would
the
ordinary
thief
get
his
money
without

detect
?

who
would
dare
to
walk
into
Garnett
's
shop
with
the
diamond
in
his

ask
for
the
four
hundred
pound
?
<EOS>
besides
,
they
have
be
sell
to
some
one

,
as
I
believe
,
to
my

Mr.

I
ask
him

He
just
laugh

shake
his

<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt

that
there
be
a
policeman
about
wait
till
I
leave
this
house

look
at
me
now
with
a
magnify
glass
from
the
window
at
the
other
side

They
have
photograph
me

I
be
go
about

every
hair
on
my
face
in
the

Hue

Cry

I
dine
at
the
club
yesterday
,

find
a
strange
waiter
.
<EOS>
I
feel
certain
that
he
be
a
policeman
do
up
in
livery
all
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
I
turn
sharp
round
in
the
street
yesterday
,
and
find
a
man
at
a
corner
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
that
man
be
watch
me
,
and
be
look
at
my
pocket
to
see
whether
the
jewel
case
be
there
.
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
I
can
think
of
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
get
them
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
something
then
to
pay
me
for
all
this
nuisance

<EOS>

I
do
wish
you
have
,

say
Lizzie

<EOS>
"
what
I
should
do
with
them
<EOS>
I
can
not
even
imagine
.
<EOS>
I
be
always
think
of
that
,
too
,
 
make
plan
for
get
rid
of
them
,
suppose
I
have
steal
them
.
<EOS>
My
belief
be
,
that
I
should
be
so
sick
of
them
that
I
should
chuck
them
over
the
bridge
into
the
river
,
 
only
that
I
should
fear
that
some
policeman
's
eye
would
be
on
me
as
I
do
it
.
<EOS>
My
present
position
be
not
comfortable
,
 
but
if
I
have
get
them
,
I
think
that
the
weight
of
them
would
crush
me
altogether
.
<EOS>
have
a
handle
to
my
name
,
and
be
a
lord
,
or
,
at
least
,
call
a
lord
,
make
it
all
the
bad
.
<EOS>
People
be
so
pleased
to
think
that
a
lord
should
have
steal
a
necklace
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
listen
to
it
all
with
a
strange
fascination
.
<EOS>
if
this
strong
man
be
so
much
upset
by
the
bare
suspicion
,
what
must
be
her
condition
?
<EOS>
the
jewel
be
in
her
desk
up
-
stair
,
and
the
police
have
be
with
her
also
,
 
be
even
now
probably
look
after
her
and
watch
her
.
<EOS>
how
much
more
difficult
must
it
be
for
her
to
deal
with
the
diamond
than
it
would
have
be
for
this
man
.
<EOS>
presently
Mrs.
Carbuncle
leave
the
room
,
and
Lucinda
follow
her
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
see
them
go
,
and
do
not
dare
to
go
with
them
.
<EOS>
She
feel
as
though
her
limb
would
not
have
carry
her
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
be
now
alone
with
her
Corsair
;
and
she
look
up
timidly
into
his
deep
-
set
eye
,
as
he
come
and
stand
over
her
.
"
<EOS>
tell
me
all
that
you
know
about
it
,
"
he
say
,
in
that
deep
,
low
voice
which
,
from
her
first
acquaintance
with
him
,
have
fill
her
with
interest
,
and
almost
with
awe
.
   
<EOS>
confidence
 
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
be
speechless
as
she
continue
to
look
up
into
the
Corsair
's
face
.
<EOS>
She
ought
to
have
answer
him
briskly
,
either
with
indignation
or
with
a
touch
of
humour
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
answer
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
be
desire
to
tell
him
all
that
she
know
about
the
robbery
,
and
she
be
unable
to
declare
that
she
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
how
much
do
he
suspect
?
<EOS>
what
do
he
believe
?
<EOS>
have
she
be
watch
by
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
have
something
of
the
truth
be
tell
to
him
?
<EOS>
and
then
would
it
not
be
well
for
her
that
he
should
know
it
all
?
<EOS>
unsupported
and
alone
<EOS>
she
could
not
bear
the
trouble
which
be
on
her
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
drive
to
tell
her
secret
to
any
one
,
have
she
not
better
tell
it
to
him
?
<EOS>
She
know
that
if
she
do
so
,
she
would
be
a
creature
in
his
hand
to
be
deal
with
as
he
please
;
 
but
would
there
not
be
a
certain
charm
in
be
so
master
?
<EOS>
He
be
but
a
pinchbeck
lord
.
<EOS>
She
have
wit
enough
to
know
that
;
but
then
she
have
wit
enough
also
to
feel
that
she
herself
be
but
a
pinchbeck
lady
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
fit
for
her
,
and
she
for
him
,
 
if
only
he
would
take
her
.
<EOS>
since
her
daydream
first
begin
,
she
have
be
long
for
a
Corsair
;
and
here
he
be
,
not
kneel
at
her
foot
,
but
stand
over
her
,
 
as
become
a
Corsair
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
he
have
master
her
now
,
and
she
could
not
speak
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
wait
perhaps
a
minute
,
look
at
her
,
before
he
renew
his
question
;
and
the
minute
seem
to
her
to
be
an
age
.
<EOS>
during
every
second
her
power
beneath
his
gaze
sink
low
and
low
.
<EOS>
there
gradually
come
a
grim
smile
over
his
face
,
and
she
be
sure
that
he
could
read
her
very
heart
.
<EOS>
then
he
call
her
by
her
christian
name
,
 
as
he
have
never
call
her
before
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
Lizzie
,
"
he
say
,
"
you
may
as
well
tell
me
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
You
know

"
  
<EOS>
"
know
what

<EOS>
"
the
word
be
audible
to
him

they
be
utter
in
the
low
whisper

about

necklace

"
I
do
not

anything

but
you
know
where
they
be

<EOS>
He
pause
again
,
still
gaze
at
her
.
<EOS>
gradually
there
come
across
his
face
,
or
she
fancy
that
it
be
so
,
a
look
of
ferocity
which
thoroughly
frighten
her
.
<EOS>
if
he
should
turn
against
her
,
and
be
league
with
the
police
against
her
,
what
chance
would
she
have
?
<EOS>
"
You
know
where
they
be

he
say
,
repeat
his
word

then
at
last
she
nod
her
head
,
assent
to
his
assertion
.

where
be

?
<EOS>
come
;
 
out
with
it
!

if
you
will
not
tell
me
,
you
must
tell
some

else

there
have
be
a

much
of
this
already

<EOS>

You

not

not

you
deal
openly
with
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
;
indeed
I

and
it
be
all
an
accident

when
I
take
them
out
of
the
box

I
only
do
it
for
safety

You
do
take

out

again
she
nod
her

and
have
get
them
now

there
be
another
nod

come

he

nothing

nothing

then
I

wrong

nothing

up

you
get

break
open

then
Lizzie
,
in
a
frightened
whisper

eye
often
turn
on

floor

tell
the
whole
story

if
I
would
have
a
minute

confess
the
truth
at
Carlisle

should
I
want

always
mean
to
tell
you

first

good

I
may

well

yes

on

the

old
now
to
sacrifice
much
for
such
a
toy
as
that
.
<EOS>
something
he
must
do
,
 
<EOS>
if
only
because
of
the
knowledge
which
have
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
away
and
leave
her
,
and
neither
say
nor
do
anything
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
and
he
could
not
betray
her
to
the
police
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
desert
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
take
hold
of
his
hand
,
and
kiss
it
as
a
suppliant
.
  
<EOS>
He
pass
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
but
more
as
though
she
be
a
child
than
a
woman
,
as
he
stand
think
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
affair
in
which
he
have
ever
be
engage
,
it
be
the
most
difficult
.
<EOS>
She
submit
to
his
embrace
,
and
lean
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
look
up
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
if
he
would
only
tell
her
that
he
love
her
,
then
he
would
be
bind
to
her
,
 
then
must
he
share
with
her
the
burthen
of
the
diamond
,
 
then
must
he
be
true
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
George
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
and
burst
into
a
low
suppress
wailing
,
with
her
face
hide
upon
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
,
"
say
he
,
still
hold
her
,
 
for
she
be
pleasant
to
hold
,
 
"
but
what
the
d
 
---
be
a
fellow
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
my
way
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
would
better
go
to
Camperdown
,
and
give
them
up
to
him
,
and
tell
him
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
sob
more
violently
than
before
,
till
her
quick
ear
catch
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
stair
,
and
in
a
moment
she
be
out
of
his
arm
and
seat
on
the
sofa
,
with
hardly
a
trace
of
tear
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
footman
,
who
desire
to
know
whether
Lady
Eustace
would
want
the
carriage
that
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
with
her
cheery
voice
,
send
her
love
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
her
assurance
that
she
would
not
want
the
carriage
before
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
you
can
do
anything
else

continue
Lord
George
,
"
except
just
give
them
up
and
brazen
it
out
.
<EOS>
I
do
not

they
would
prosecute
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
prosecute
me
!

<EOS>
ejaculate
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
perjury
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"

and
what
could
they
do
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
lock
you
up
for
five
year
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
because
I
have
my
own
necklace
under
the
pillow
in
my
own
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
think
of
all
the
trouble
you
have
give
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
give
them
up
to
Mr.
Camperdown

<EOS>
They
be
mine

my
very
own

<EOS>
My
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
who
be
much
more
of
a
lawyer
than
Mr.
Camperdown
,
say
so
.
<EOS>
oh
,
George
,
do
think
of
something
!
<EOS>
do
not
tell
me
that
I
must
give

up

<EOS>
Would
not
Mr.
Benjamin
buy
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
 
for
half
nothing
;
and
then
go
and
tell
the
whole
story
and
get
money
from
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
trust
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
trust
you
.
"
<EOS>
She
cling
to
him
and
implore
him
,
and
do
get
from
him
a
renew
promise
that
he
would
not
reveal
her
secret
.
<EOS>
She
want
him
to
take
the
terrible
packet
from
her
there
and
then
,
and
use
his
own
judgment
in
dispose
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
this
he
positively
refuse
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
protest
that
they
be
safe
with
her
than
they
could
be
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
explain
to
her
that
if
they
be
find
in
his
hand
,
his
offence
in
have
them
in
his
possession
would
be
much
great
than
her
.
<EOS>
They
be
her
own
,
 
as
she
be
ever
so
ready
to
assert
;
or
if
not
her
own
,
the
ownership
be
so
doubtful
that
she
could
not
be
accuse
of
have
steal
them
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
need
to
consider
it
all
,
 
to
sleep
upon
it
,
 
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
what
he
would
do
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
other
trouble
on
her
mind
as
to
which
he
be
call
upon
to
give
her
counsel
before
he
be
allow
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
the
detective
officer
that
she
would
submit
her
box
and
desk
to
be
search
if
her
cousin
Frank
should
advise
it
.
<EOS>
if
the
policeman
be
to
return
with
her
cousin
while
the
diamond
be
still
in
her
desk
,
what
should
she
do
?
<EOS>
He
may
come
at
any
time
;
and
then
she
would
be
bind
to
obey
him
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
think
that
they
be
steal
at
Carlisle
?
"
ask
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
he
think
so
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
almost
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
never
ask
to
search
your
person
,
"
suggest
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
could
not
say
.
<EOS>
She
have
simply
declare
that
she
would
be
guide
by
her
cousin

<EOS>
have
them
about
you

out
with
you

keep
them
in
your
pocket
while
you
be
in
the
house
during
the
day
.
<EOS>
They
will
hardly
bring
a
woman
with
them
to
search
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
a
woman
with
the
man
when
he
come
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
must
refuse
in
spite
of
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
show
yourself
angry
with
him
and
with
everybody
.
<EOS>
swear
that
you
do
not
intend
to
submit
yourself
to
such
indignity
as
that
.
<EOS>
They
can
not
do
it
without
a
magistrate
's
order
,
unless
you
permit
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
they
will
come
at
all
;
and
if
they
do
they
will
only
look
at
your
clothe
and
your
box
.
<EOS>
if
they
ask
to
do
more
,
be
stout
with
them
and
refuse
.
<EOS>
of
course
they
will
suspect
you
,
but
they
do
that
already
.
<EOS>
and
your
cousin
will
suspect
you
;
 
but
you
must
put
up
with
that
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
bad
;
 
but
I
see
nothing
better
.
<EOS>
but
,
of
all
thing
,
say
nothing
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
promise
to
be
obedient
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
take
his
leave
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
true
to
me
;
 
will
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
still
cling
to
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
promise
her
that
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
George
<EOS>
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
have
no
friend
now
but
you

<EOS>
You
will
care
for
me
?
"
<EOS>
He
take
her
in
his
arm
and
kiss
her
,
and
promise
her
that
he
would
care
for
her
.
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
save
himself
from
do
so
?
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
Lizzie
sit
down
to
think
of
it
all
,
and
feel
sure
that
at
last
she
have
find
her
Corsair
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
go
to
the
Theatre
 
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lizzie
Eustace
do
not
,
in
these
day
,
shut
themselves
up
because
there
be
trouble
in
the
household
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
suit
the
creed
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
on
social
matter
to
be
shut
up
from
the
amusement
of
life
.
<EOS>
She
have
sacrifice
too
much
in
seek
them
for
that
,
and
be
too
conscious
of
the
price
she
pay
for
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
mid
-
winter
,
but
nevertheless
there
be
generally
some
amusement
arrange
for
every
evening
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
very
fond
of
the
play
,
and
make
herself
acquaint
with
every
new
piece
as
it
come
out
.
<EOS>
every
actor
and
actress
of
note
on
the
stage
be
know
to
her
,
and
she
deal
freely
in
criticism
on
their
respective
merit
.
<EOS>
the
three
lady
have
a
box
at
the
Haymarket
take
for
this
very
evening
,
at
which
a
new
piece
,
"
the
Noble
Jilt
,
"
from
the
hand
of
a
very
eminent
author
,
be
to
be
produce
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
talk
a
great
deal
about
"
the
Noble
Jilt
,
"
and
could
boast
that
she
have
discuss
the
merit
of
the
two
chief
character
with
the
actor
and
actress
who
be
to
undertake
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Talbot
have
assure
her
that
the
Margaret
be
altogether
impracticable
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
quite
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
the
hero
,
Steinmark
,
 
it
be
a
part
that
no
man
could
play
so
as
to
obtain
the
sympathy
of
an
audience
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
second
hero
,
 
a
Flemish
Count
,
 
tame
as
rain
-
water
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
say
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
anxious
for
the
success
of
the
piece
,
which
,
as
she
say
,
have
its
merit
;
but
she
be
sure
that
it
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
She
have
talk
about
it
a
great
deal
,
and
now
,
when
the
evening
come
,
she
be
not
go
to
be
deter
from
see
it
by
any
trouble
in
reference
to
a
diamond
necklace
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
be
leave
by
Lord
George
,
have
many
doubt
on
the
subject
,
 
whether
she
would
go
or
stay
at
home
.
<EOS>
if
he
would
have
come
to
her
,
or
her
cousin
Frank
,
or
if
,
have
it
be
possible
,
Lord
Fawn
would
have
come
,
she
would
have
give
up
the
play
very
willingly
.
<EOS>
but
to
be
alone
,
 
with
her
necklace
in
the
desk
up
-
stair
,
or
in
her
pocket
,
be
terrible
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
they
could
not
search
her
or
her
box
while
she
be
at
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
take
the
necklace
with
her
there
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
her
to
leave
it
in
her
desk
,
when
she
go
from
home
.
  
<EOS>
Lucinda
,
also
,
be
quite
determine
that
she
would
see
the
new
piece
.
<EOS>
She
declare
to
her
aunt
,
in
Lizzie
's
presence
,
without
a
vestige
of
a
smile
,
that
it
may
be
well
to
see
how
a
jilt
could
behave
herself
,
so
as
to
do
her
work
of
jilt
in
any
noble
fashion
.
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
say
her
aunt
,
"
you
let
thing
weigh
upon
your
heart
a
great
deal
too
much
.
"
<EOS>
"
not
upon
my
heart
,
Aunt
Jane
,
"
the
young
lady
have
answer
.
<EOS>
She
also
intend
to
go
,
and
when
she
have
make
up
her
mind
to
anything
,
nothing
would
deter
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
desire
to
stay
at
home
in
order
that
she
may
see
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
the
play
may
be
very
bad
,
"
she
say
,
"
but
it
can
hardly
be
so
bad
as
real
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
Lord
George
have
leave
her
,
creep
up
-
stair
,
and
sit
for
awhile
think
of
her
condition
,
with
the
key
of
her
desk
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Should
there
come
a
knock
at
the
door
<EOS>
,
the
case
of
diamond
would
be
in
her
pocket
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Her
own
room
door
be
bolt
on
the
inside
,
so
that
she
may
have
an
instant
for
her
preparation
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
resolve
that
she
would
carry
out
Lord
George
's
recommendation
,
and
that
no
policeman
or
woman
should
examine
her
person
,
unless
it
be
do
by
violence
.
<EOS>
there
she
sit
,
almost
expect
that
at
every
moment
her
cousin
would
be
there
with
Bunfit
and
the
woman
.
<EOS>
but
nobody
come
,
and
at
six
she
go
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
after
much
consideration
she
then
leave
the
diamond
in
the
desk
.
<EOS>
surely
no
one
would
come
to
search
at
such
an
hour
as
that
.
<EOS>
no
one
have
come
when
the
carriage
be
announce
,
and
the
three
lady
go
off
together
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
whole
way
Mrs.
Carbuncle
talk
of
the
terrible
situation
in
which
poor
Lord
George
be
place
by
the
robbery
,
and
of
all
that
Lizzie
owe
him
on
account
of
his
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
the
least
you
can
do
for
him
be
to
give
him
all
that
you
have
get
to
give
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
he
want
me
to
give
him
anything
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
be
quite
plain
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
wish
it
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
have
be
dear
friend
,
 
very
dear
friend
,
and
there
be
nothing
I
wish
so
much
as
to
see
him
properly
settle
.
<EOS>
Ill
-
natured
people
like
to
say
all
manner
of
thing
because
everybody
do
not
choose
to
live
in
their
own
heartless
,
conventional
form
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
assure
you
there
be
nothing
between
me
and
Lord
George
which
need
prevent
him
from
give
his
whole
heart
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
there
be
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
who
love
an
opportunity
of
give
Mrs.
Carbuncle
a
little
rap
.
  
<EOS>
the
play
,
as
a
play
,
be
a
failure
;
at
least
so
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
the
critic
,
on
the
next
morning
,
be
somewhat
divided
,
 
not
only
in
judgment
,
but
as
to
fact
.
<EOS>
to
say
how
a
play
have
be
receive
be
of
more
moment
than
to
speak
of
its
own
merit
or
of
the
merit
of
the
actor
.
<EOS>
three
or
four
of
the
paper
declare
that
the
audience
be
not
only
eulogistic
,
but
enthusiastic
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
other
aver
that
the
piece
fall
very
flatly
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
not
act
above
four
or
five
dozen
time
consecutively
,
it
must
be
regard
as
a
failure
.
<EOS>
on
their
way
home
Mrs.
Carbuncle
declare
that
Minnie
Talbot
have
do
her
very
best
with
such
a
part
as
Margaret

but
that
the
character
afford
no
scope
for
sympathy
.
"
<EOS>
a
noble
jilt
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
eloquently
,
"
be
a
contradiction
in
term
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
a
woman
,
when
she
have
once
say
the
word
,
be
bind
to
stick
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
delicacy
of
the
female
character
should
not
admit
of
hesitation
between
two
man
.
<EOS>
the
idea
be
quite
revolting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
may
not
one
have
an
idea
of
no
man
at
all
?
"
 
<EOS>
ask
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
Must
that
be
revolt
also
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
a
young
woman
may
entertain
such
an
idea
;
though
for
my
part
I
look
upon
it
as
unnatural
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
have
once
give
herself
there
can
be
no
take
back
without
the
loss
of
that
aroma
which
should
be
the
apple
of
a
young
woman
's
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
she
find
that
she
have
make
a
mistake
 
?
"
say
Lucinda
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
not
a
young
woman
make
a
mistake
as
well
as
an
old
woman

<EOS>
Her
aroma
will
not
prevent
her
from
have
be
wrong

find
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
such
mistake
,
as
you
call
them
,
always
arise
from
fantastic
notion
.
<EOS>
look
at
this
piece
.
<EOS>
why
do
the
lady
jilt
her
lover
?
<EOS>
not
because
she
do
not
like
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
just
as
fond
of
him
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
stupid
sort
of
a
fellow
,
and
I
think
she
be
quite
right
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
never
marry
a
man
merely
because
I
say
I
would

<EOS>
if
I
find
I

him

I
would
leave
him
at

I

I
would
leave

I
find
I

<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
to
talk
of
aroma

to
live
with
a
man
you
do
not

be
the
devil

<EOS>
"
My

those
whom
God

this
Mrs.

just

They

with

<EOS>
but
it
behove
her
to

"
I

It

but
how
much
better
that

<EOS>
Shall

<EOS>
"
then
together

the

<EOS>
a
superintendent
of
police
be
there
before
they
go
to
bed
,
and
a
list
be
make
out
.
<EOS>
the
superintendent
be
of
opinion
that
the
thing
have
be
do
very
cleverly
,
but
be
of
opinion
that
the
thief
have
expect
to
find
more
plunder
.
<EOS>
"
They
do
not
care
so
much
about
banknote
,
my
lady
,
because
they
fetch
such
a
low
price
with
them
as
they
deal
with
.
<EOS>
the
three
sovereign
be
more
to
them
than
all
the
forty
pound
in
note
.
<EOS>
"
the
superintendent
have
hear
of
the
diamond
necklace
,
and
express
an
opinion
that
poor
Lady

especially
mark
out
for

<EOS>
"
It
all

such
a

"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
the
superintendent
,
who
intend
to
be
consolatory
to
Lizzie
,
express
his
opinion
that
it
be
very
hard
to
know
what
a
young
woman
be
.
<EOS>
"
They
look
as
soft
as
butter
,
and
they
be
as
sly
as
fox
,
and
as
quick
,
as
quick
 
as
quick
as
grease
lightning
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
a
piece
of
business
as
this
which
have
just
occur
,
will
make
people
intimate
at
a
very
short
notice
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
diamond
necklace
,
know
to
be
worth
ten
thousand
pound
,
have
at
last
be
steal
in
earnest
!
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
the
policeman
be
go
,
and
the
noise
be
over
,
and
the
house
be
close
,
slink
away
to
her
bedroom
,
refuse
any
aid
in
lieu
of
that
of
the
wicked
Patience
.
<EOS>
She
herself
have
examine
the
desk
beneath
the
eye
of
her
two
friend
and
of
the
policeman
,
and
have
see
at
once
that
the
case
be
go
.
<EOS>
the
money
be
go
too
,
as
she
be
rejoice
to
find
.
<EOS>
She
perceive
at
once
that
have
the
money
be
leave
,
 
the
very
leaving
of
it
would
have
go
to
prove
that
other
prize
have
be
there
.
<EOS>
but
the
money
be
go
,
 
money
of
which
she
have
give
a
correct
account
;
 
and
she
could
now
honestly
allege
that
she
have
be
rob
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
at
last
really
lose
her
great
treasure
;
 
and
if
the
treasure
should
be
find
,
then
would
she
infallibly
be
expose
.
<EOS>
She
have
talk
twice
of
give
away
her
necklace
,
and
have
seriously
think
of
get
rid
of
it
by
bury
it
deep
in
the
sea
.
<EOS>
but
now
that
it
be
in
very
truth
go
from
her
,
the
loss
of
it
be
horrible
to
her
.
<EOS>
ten
thousand
pound
,
for
which
she
have
struggle
so
much
and
borne
so
many
thing
,
which
have
come
to
be
the
prevail
fact
of
her
life
,
go
from
her
for
ever
!
<EOS>
nevertheless
it
be
not
that
sorrow
,
that
regret
,
which
have
so
nearly
overpower
her
in
the
dining
-
parlour
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
she
hardly
know
,
have
hardly
think
,
whether
the
diamond
have
or
have
not
be
take
.
<EOS>
but
the
feeling
come
upon
her
at
once
that
her
own
disgrace
be
every
hour
be
bring
nearer
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
secret
be
no
longer
quite
her
own
.
<EOS>
one
man
know
it
,
and
he
have
talk
to
her
of
perjury
and
of
five
year
"
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
patience
must
have
know
it
,
too
;
and
now
some
one
else
also
know
it
.
<EOS>
the
police
,
of
course
,
would
find
it
out
,
and
then
horrid
word
would
be
use
against
her
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
know
what
perjury
be
.
<EOS>
It
sound
like
forgery
and
burglary
.
<EOS>
to
stand
up
before
a
judge
and
be
try
,
 
and
then
to
be
lock
up
for
five
year
in
prison
 
!
<EOS>
what
an
end
would
this
be
to
all
her
glorious
success
?
<EOS>
and
what
evil
have
she
do
to
merit
all
this
terrible
punishment
?
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
her
in
her
bedroom
at
Carlisle
she
have
simply
be
too
much
frightened
to
tell
them
all
that
the
necklace
be
at
that
moment
under
her
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
She
try
to
think
of
it
all
,
and
to
form
some
idea
in
her
mind
of
what
may
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
Patience
Crabstick
have
know
her
secret
,
but
how
long
have
the
girl
know
it
?
<EOS>
and
how
have
the
girl
discover
it
?
<EOS>
She
be
almost
certain
,
from
certain
circumstance
,
from
word
which
the
girl
have
speak
,
and
from
sign
which
she
have
observe
,
that
Patience
have
not
even
suspect
that
the
necklace
have
be
bring
with
them
from
Carlisle
to
London
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
the
coming
of
Bunfit
and
the
woman
would
have
set
the
girl
's
mind
to
work
in
that
direction
;
but
then
Bunfit
and
the
woman
have
only
be
there
on
that
morning
.
<EOS>
the
Corsair
know
the
fact
,
and
no
one
but
the
Corsair
.
<EOS>
that
the
Corsair
be
a
Corsair
,
the
suspicion
of
the
police
have
prove
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
offer
the
necklace
to
the
Corsair
;
but
when
so
offer
,
he
have
refuse
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
understand
that
he
should
see
the
danger
of
accept
the
diamond
from
her
hand
,
and
yet
should
be
desirous
of
have
them
.
<EOS>
and
may
not
he
have
think
that
he
could
best
relieve
her
from
the
burthen
of
their
custody
in
this
manner
?
<EOS>
She
feel
no
anger
against
the
Corsair
as
she
weigh
the
probability
of
his
have
take
them
in
this
fashion
.
<EOS>
a
Corsair
must
be
a
Corsair
.
<EOS>
be
he
to
come
to
her
and
confess
the
deed
,
she
would
almost
like
him
<EOS>
the
well
for
it
,
 
<EOS>
admire
his
skill
and
enterprise
.
<EOS>
but
how
very
clever
he
must
have
be
,
and
how
brave
!
<EOS>
He
have
know
,
no
doubt
,
that
the
three
lady
be
all
go
to
the
theatre
;
but
in
how
short
a
time
have
he
get
rid
of
the
other
woman
and
avail
himself
of
the
service
of
Patience
Crabstick
!
  
<EOS>
but
in
what
way
would
she
conduct
herself
when
the
police
should
come
to
her
on
the
follow
morning
,
 
the
police
and
all
the
other
people
who
would
crowd
to
the
house
?
<EOS>
how
should
she
receive
her
cousin
Frank
?
<EOS>
how
should
she
look
when
the
coincidence
of
the
double
robbery
should
be
speak
of
in
her
hearing
?
<EOS>
how
should
she
bear
herself
when
,
as
of
course
would
be
the
case
,
she
should
again
be
take
before
the
magistrate
,
and
make
to
swear
as
to
the
loss
of
her
property
?
<EOS>
Must
she
commit
more
perjury
,
with
the
certainty
that
various
people
must
know
that
her
oath
be
false
?
<EOS>
all
the
world
would
suspect
her
.
<EOS>
all
the
world
would
soon
know
the
truth
.
<EOS>
may
it
not
be
possible
that
the
diamond
be
at
this
moment
in
the
hand
of
Messrs.
Camperdown
,
and
that
they
would
be
produce
before
her
eye
,
as
soon
as
her
second
false
oath
have
be
register
against
her
?
<EOS>
and
yet
how
could
she
tell
the
truth
?
<EOS>
and
what
would
the
Corsair
think
of
her
,
 
<EOS>
the
Corsair
,
who
would
know
everything
?
<EOS>
She
make
one
resolution
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
be
take
into
court
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
and
the
people
may
come
to
her
,
but
she
would
not
go
before
them
.
<EOS>
when
the
morning
come
she
say
that
she
be
ill
,
and
refuse
to
leave
her
bed
.
<EOS>
policeman
,
she

,

the
house
early
.
<EOS>
at
about
nine
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lucinda

up
and
in
her
room
.
<EOS>
the
excitement
of
the
affair
have
take
them
from
their
bed
,
 
but
she
would
not
stir
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
absolutely
necessary
,
she
say
,
the
man
must
come
into
her
room
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
so
overset
by
what
have
occur
on
the
previous
night
,
that
she
could
not
leave
her
room
.
<EOS>
She
appeal
to
Lucinda
as
to
the
fact
of
her
illness
.
<EOS>
the
trouble
of
these
robbery
be
so
great
upon
her
that
her
heart
be
almost
broken
.
<EOS>
if
her
deposition
must
be
take
,
she
would
make
it
in
bed
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
magistrate
do
come
into
her
room
and
the
deposition
be
take
.
<EOS>
forty
-
three
pound

be
take
from
her
desk
,
and
certain
jewel
,
which
she
describe
,
from
her
dressing

case
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
she
be
aware
,
no
other
property
of
her
be
miss
.
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
she
say
in
answer
to
a
direct
question
from
the
magistrate
,
which
,
as
she
think
,
be
ask
with
a
stern
voice
and
search
eye
.
<EOS>
and
so
,
a
second
time
,
she
have
swear
falsely
.
<EOS>
but
this
at
least
be
gain
,
 
that
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
be
not
look
at
her
as
she
swear
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
be
in
the
house
for
a
great
part
of
the
day
,
but
he
do
not
ask
to
be
admit
to
Lizzie

room
;
 
nor
do
she
ask
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
be
there
late
in
the
afternoon
,
and
go
up
at
once
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
the
moment
that
she
see
him
she
stretch
out
her
arm
to
him
,
and
burst
into
tear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
poor

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
how

<EOS>
the
robber

here
last
night
,
and
magistrate
and
policeman
and
people

all
day
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
fall
into
a
fit
of
sob
and
wailing
,
which
be
,
in
truth
,
hysterical
.
<EOS>
for
,
 
if
the
reader
think
of
it
,
 
the
poor
woman
have
a
great
deal
to
bear
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
into
whose
mind
no
glimmer
of
suspicion
against
his
cousin
have
yet
enter
,
and
who
firmly
believe
that
she
have
be
make
a
victim
because
of
the
value
of
her
diamond
,
 
and
who
have
a
theory
of
his
own
about
the
robbery
at
Carlisle
,
to
the
circumstance
of
which
he
be
now
at
some
pain
to
make
these
latter
circumstance
adhere
,
 
be
very
tender
with
his
cousin
,
and
remain
in
the
house
for
more
than
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frank
,
what
have
I
better
do
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
I
will

<EOS>
oh
yes

I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you

"
  
"
I
fear
nothing
,
 
nothing
but
be
where
these
policeman

<EOS>
oh

"
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
shudder
and
be
again
hysterical
.
<EOS>
nor
be
she
act
the
condition
.
<EOS>
as
she
remember
the
magistrate
,
and
the
detective
,
and
the
policeman
in
their
uniform
,
 
and
reflect
that
she
may
probably
see
much
more
of
them
before
the
game
be
play
out
,
the
thought
that
crowd
on
her
be
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
child
be
there
,
and
it
be
your
own
house

<EOS>
go
there
till
all
this

"
<EOS>
Whereupon
she
promise
him
that
,
as
soon
as
she
be
well
enough
,
she
would
at
once
go
to
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
the
Eustace
diamond
be
lock
up
in
a
small
safe
fix
into
the
wall
at
the
back
of
a
small
cellar
beneath
the
establishment
of
Messrs.
Harter

Benjamin

in
Minto
Lane

in
the
City

<EOS>
Messrs.
Harter

Benjamin
always
keep
a
second
place
of
business
.
<EOS>
Their
great
shop
be
at
the
west

end

but
they
have
accommodation
in
the
City
.
  
<EOS>
the
chronicler
state
this
at
once
,
as
he
scorn
to
keep
from
his
reader
any
secret
that
be
know
to

.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
Sick
-
Room
 
<EOS>
when
the
Hertford
Street
robbery
be
three
day
old
,
and
be
still
the
talk
of
all
the
town
,
Lizzie
Eustace
be
really
ill
.
<EOS>
She
have
promise
to
go
down
to
Scotland
in
compliance
with
the
advice
give
to
her
by
her
cousin
Frank
,
and
at
the
moment
of
promising
would
have
be
willing
enough
to
be
transport
at
once
to
Portray
,
have
that
be
possible
 
so
as
to
be
beyond
the
visit
of
policeman
and
the
authority
of
lawyer
and
magistrate
;
but
as
the
hour
pass
over
her
head
,
and
as
her
presence
of
mind
return
to
her
,
she
remember
that
even
at
Portray
she
would
not
be
out
of
danger
,
and
that
she
could
do
nothing
in
furtherance
of
her
plan
if
once
immure
there
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
be
in
London
,
Frank
Greystock
be
in
London
,
and
Lord
Fawn
be
in
London
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
ever
necessary
to
her
that
she
should
find
a
husband
among
them
,
 
a
husband
who
would
not
be
less
her
husband
when
the
truth
of
that
business
at
Carlisle
should
be
know
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
in
fact
,
steal
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
endeavour
to
comfort
herself
by
repeat
to
herself
over
and
over
again
that
assurance
.
<EOS>
She
have
steal
nothing
;
and
she
still
think
that
if
she
could
obtain
the
support
of
some
strong
arm
on
which
to
lean
,
she
may
escape
punishment
for
those
false
oath
which
she
have
swear
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
may
take
her
abroad
,
and
the
whole
thing
would
die
away
.
<EOS>
if
she
should
succeed
with
Lord
George
,
of
course
he
would
take
her
abroad
,
and
there
would
be
no
need
for
any
speedy
return
.
<EOS>
They
may
roam
among
island
in
pleasant
warm
sun
,
and
the
dream
of
her
youth
may
be
realise
.
<EOS>
Her
income
be
still
her
own
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
touch
that
.
<EOS>
so
she
think
,
at
least
,
 
oppress
by
some
slight
want
of
assurance
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
be
she
to
go
at
once
to
Scotland
,
she
must
for
the
present
give
up
that
game
altogether
.
<EOS>
if
Frank
would
pledge
himself
to
become
her
husband
in
three
or
four
,
or
even
in
six
month
,
she
would
go
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
have
more
confidence
in
Frank
than
even
in
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
as
for
love
,
 
she
would
sometimes
tell
herself
that
she
be
violently
in
love
;
but
she
hardly
know
with
which
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
be
certainly
the
good
representative
of
that
perfect
Corsair
which
her
dream
have
represent
to
her
;
but
,
in
regard
to
work
life
,
she
think
that
she
like
her
cousin
Frank
better
than
she
have
ever
yet
like
any
other
human
being
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
she
be
now
in
that
condition
,
as
she
acknowledge
to
herself
,
that
she
be
hardly
entitle
to
choose
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
promise
to
marry
her
,
and
to
him
as
a
husband
she
conceive
that
she
still
have
a
right
.
<EOS>
nothing
have
as
yet
be
prove
against
her
which
could
justify
him
in
repudiate
his
engagement
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
no
doubt
,
assert
with
all
vehemence
to
her
cousin
that
no
consideration
would
now
induce
her
to
give
her
hand
to
Lord
Fawn
;
 
and
when
make
that
assurance
she
have
be
,
after
her
nature
,
sincere
.
<EOS>
but
circumstance
be
change
since
that
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
much
hope
that
Lord
Fawn
may
be
make
to
succumb
,
 
though
evidence
have
reach
her
before
the
last
robbery
which
induce
her
to
believe
that
he
do
not
consider
himself
to
be
quite
secure
.
<EOS>
in
these
circumstance
she
be
unwilling
to
leave
London
though
she
have
promise
,
and
be
hardly
sorry
to
find
an
excuse
in
her
recognise
illness
.
  
<EOS>
and
she
be
ill
.
<EOS>
though
her
mind
be
again
at
work
with
scheme
on
which
she
would
not
have
busy
herself
without
hope
,
yet
she
have
not
recover
from
the
actual
bodily
prostration
to
which
she
have
be
compel
to
give
way
when
first
tell
of
the
robbery
on
her
return
from
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
moment
then
in
which
she
think
that
her
heart
would
have
break
,
 
moment
in
which
,
but
that
the
power
of
speech
be
want
,
she
would
have
tell
everything
to
Lucinda
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
march
up
-
stair
with
the
policeman
at
her
heel
she
would
have
willingly
sell
all
her
hope
,
Portray
Castle
,
her
lover
,
her
necklace
,
her
income
,
her
beauty
,
for
any
assurance
of
the
humble
security
.
<EOS>
with
that
quickness
of
intellect
which
be
her
peculiar
gift
,
she
have
soon
understand
,
in
the
midst
of
her
suffering
,
that
her
necklace
have
be
take
by
thief
whose
robbery
may
assist
her
for
a
while
in
keep
her
secret
,
rather
than
lead
to
the
immediate
divulging
of
it
.
<EOS>
neither
Camperdown
nor
Bunfit
have
be
at
work
among
the
box
.
<EOS>
Her
secret
have
be
discover
,
no
doubt
,
by
Patience
Crabstick
,
and
the
diamond
be
go
.
<EOS>
but
money
also
be
take
,
and
the
world
nee
not
know
that
the
diamond
have
be
there
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
George
know
.
<EOS>
and
then
there
arise
to
her
that
question
:
have
the
diamond
be
take
in
consequence
of
that
revelation
to
Lord
George
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
surprising
that
in
the
midst
of
all
this
Lizzie
should
be
really
ill
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
most
anxious
to
see
Lord
George
;
but
,
if
what
Mrs.
Carbuncle
say
to
her
be
true
,
Lord
George
refuse
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
believe
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
be
,
therefore
,
quite
in
the
dark
about
her
Corsair
.
<EOS>
as
she
could
only
communicate
with
him
through
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
it
may
well
be
the
case
that
he
should
have
be
tell
that
he
could
not
have
access
to
her
.
<EOS>
of
course
there
be
difficulty
.
<EOS>
that
her
cousin
Frank
should
see
her
in
her
bedroom
,
 
her
cousin
Frank
,
with
whom
it
be
essentially
necessary
that
she
should
hold
counsel
as
to
her
present
great
difficulty
,
 
be
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
hesitation
about
that
.
<EOS>
a
fresh
nightcap
,
and
a
clean
pocket
-
handkerchief
with
a
bit
of
lace
round
it
,
and
,
perhaps
,
some
pretty
covering
to
her
shoulder
if
she
be
to
be
require
to
sit
up
in
bed
,
and
the
thing
be
arrange
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
spend
the
good
part
of
his
day
in
her
bedroom
if
he
could
have
spare
the
time
.
<EOS>
but
the
Corsair
be
not
a
cousin
,
 
nor
as
yet
an
acknowledge
lover
.
<EOS>
there
be
difficulty
even
in
frame
a
reason
for
her
request
,
when
she
make
it
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;
and
the
very
reason
which
she
give
be
hand
back
to
her
as
the
Corsair
's
reason
for
not
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
desire
to
see
him
because
he
have
be
so
much
mixed
up
in
the
matter
of
these
terrible
robbery
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
declare
to
her
that
Lord
George
would
not
come
to
her
because
his
name
have
be
so
frequently
mention
in
connexion
with
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
there
can
be
no
real
reason

his

you
up

anything
between
you

I
once

there

there
be
something
in
the
tone

grate
on

seem

over

care
more
about

It

be
no

can
assure
you

Mrs.
Carbuncle

<EOS>
Lizzie
could
not
press
her
request
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
she
know
more
about
it
than
do
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
the
secret
be
in
her
own
bosom
,
 
the
secret
as
to
the
midnight
robbery
at
Carlisle
,

that
secret
she
have
tell
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
robbery
in
London
she
know
nothing
,
 
except
that
it
have
be
perpetrate
through
the
treachery
of
Patience
Crabstick

<EOS>
do
Lord
George
know
more
about
it
than
she
know
?
 
<EOS>
and
if
so
,
be
he
now
deter
by
that
knowledge
from
visit
her
?
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear

"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
that
a
gentleman
visit
a
lady
with
whom
he
have
no
connexion

something
very
peculiar

"
<EOS>
Lizzie
make
a
motion
of
impatience
under
the
bedclothe
.
<EOS>
any
such
argument
be
trash
to
her
,

she
know
that
it
be
trash
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
also
.
<EOS>
what
be
one
man
in
her
bedroom
more
than
another
?
<EOS>
She
could
see
a
dozen
doctor
if
she
please
,
and
if
so
,
why
not
this
man
,
whose
real
power
of
doctor
her
would
be
so
much
more
efficacious
?
<EOS>
"
You
would
want
to
see
him
alone
,
too
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
and
,
of
course
,
the
police
would
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
surprise
that
he
should
stay
away
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
's
condition
do
not
admit
of
much
argument
on
her
side
,
and
she
only
show
her
opposition
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
by
be
cross
and
querulous
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
come
to
her
with
great
constancy
almost
every

from
him
she
do
hear
about
the

all
that
he
know

hear

three

when
six
day

even
when
ten

nobody

<EOS>
the

on

to
him
the
two
robbery
,
that
at
Carlisle
and
the
last
affair
in
Hertford
Street
,
be
of
course
distinct
.
<EOS>
there
be
those
who
believe
that
the
Hertford
Street
thief
and
the
Carlisle
thief
be
not
only
the

,

that
they
have
be
in
quest
of
the

plunder
,

have
at
last
succeed

Frank
be
not
one
of
these
.
<EOS>
He
never
for
a
moment
doubt
that
the
diamond
have
be
take
at
Carlisle
,
and
explain
the
second
robbery
by
the
supposition
that
Patience
Crabstick
have
be
embolden
by
success

<EOS>
the
iron
box
have
no

be
take
by

assistance

familiarity

the
thief

establish
,

lead
to
the
second
robbery

<EOS>
Lizzie
's
loss
in
that
second
robbery
have
amount
to
some
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
this
be
Frank
Greystock
's
theory
,

of
course
it
be
one
very
comfortable
to
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
all
seem
to
think
that

diamond
be
at

he
say
to
her
one
day

"
that
would
be
very
terrible
,
of
course
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
to
whose
mind
there
be
something
consolatory
in
the
idea
that
the
whole
affair
of
the
robbery
may
perhaps
remain
so
mysterious
as
to
remove
her
from
the
danger
of
other
punishment
than
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
sure
that
he
could
not
do
it

Frank
,

<EOS>
I
do

will

it

He
do
not
care
to
remind
her
then
,
as
she
lie
in
bed

that
he
have
be
very
urgent
in
his
advice
to
her
to
abandon
the
diamond

not
the
less
urgent
because
he
have
think
that

unjust

be
true

this
be
all
very
well

be
not

its
effect
on

be
hardly

many

Frank

<EOS>
as
she
say
this
she
rise
in

sit
with
her
eye
fix
upon

her
thin

there

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
the
honest

I
fear

fare
bad

the

you

<EOS>
I
think
you
admit

<EOS>
She
to
her

must
pay
the
penalty

honesty

never

when
she
have
do
speak

he
sit
silent
by
her
bedside
,
but
,
almost
unconsciously
,
he
stretch
out
his
left
hand
and
take
her
right
hand
in
his

<EOS>
for
a
few
second
she
admit
this
,
and
she
lie
there
with
their
hand
clasp
.
<EOS>
then
with
a
start
she
draw
back
her
arm

and
retreat
as

she
say

You

<EOS>
oh

Frank

Frank

will
you
give

<EOS>
what
be
it
that
you
promise
me
when
we
sit
together
upon

rock
at
Portray
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
inexpressibly
difficult
for
a
man
to
refuse
the
tender
of
a
woman
's
love
.
<EOS>
We
may
almost
say
that
a
man
should
do
so
as
a
matter
of
course
,
 
that
the
thing
so
offer
become
absolutely
valueless
by
the
offer
,
 
that
the
woman
who
can
make
it
have
put
herself
out
of
court
by
her
own
abandonment
of
the
privilege
due
to
her
as
a
woman
,
 
that
stern
rebuke
and
even
express
contempt
be
justify
by
such
conduct
,
 
and
that
the
fair
beauty
and
most
alluring
charm
of
feminine
grace
should
lose
their
attraction
when
thus
tender
openly
in
the
market
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
such
be
our
theory
as
to
love
and
love
-
making
.
<EOS>
but
the
action
to
be
take
by
us
in
matter
as
to
which
the
plain
theory
prevail
for
the
guidance
of
our
practice
,
depend
so
frequently
on
accompany
circumstance
and
correlative
issue
,
that
the
theory
,
as
often
as
not
,
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Frank
could
not
despise
this
woman
,
and
could
not
be
stern
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
tell
her
boldly
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
in
the
way
of
love
.
<EOS>
He
make
excuse
for
her
,
and
persuade
himself
that
there
be
peculiar
circumstance
in
her
position
justify
unwomanly
conduct
,
although
,
have
he
examine
himself
on
the
subject
,
he
would
have
find
it
difficult
to
say
what
those
circumstance
be
.
<EOS>
She
be
rich
,
beautiful
,
clever
,
 
and
<EOS>
he
be
flatter
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
know
that
he
could
not
marry
her
;
 
and
he
know
also
that
much
as
he
like
her
<EOS>
he
do
not
love
her
.

"
<EOS>

be
clever

a

from

it
not
true
that
you
be
in
debt

<EOS>
"
what
of
that

<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
Lizzie

I
do
not

help
from
you

<EOS>

that
be
so
like
a
man
's
pride

<EOS>
do
we
not

know

in
such
a
career
as
you
have
mark
out
for
yourself
,
wealth
,
or
at
any
rate
an
easy
income

be
necessary

<EOS>
do
you
think
that
I
can
not
put
two

two
together

<EOS>
do
you
believe
so
meanly
of
me
as
to

I
should
have
say
to
you
what
I
have
say
,
if
I
do
not
know
that
I
could
help
you

<EOS>
a
man
,
I
believe
,
can
not
understand
that
love
which
induce
a
woman
to
sacrifice
her
pride
simply
for
his
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
you
prosper

<EOS>
I
want
to
see
you
a
great
man

a
lord

I
know
that
you
can
not
become
so
without
an
income

<EOS>
ah
,
I
wish
I
could
give
you
all
that
I
have
get
,
and
save
you
from
the
encumbrance
that
be
attach
to
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
would
then
have
tell
her
of
his
engagement
to
Lucy
,
and
of
his
resolution
to
adhere
to
that
promise
,
have
not
Mrs.
Carbuncle

moment
enter
the

<EOS>
Frank
have
be

as

still
an
invalid

to
some
extent
under

it
be
natural

well
enough

He
make

to
do
his
very
good

stupendous

<EOS>
agree
in
declare
that
the
job
in
hand
be
too
much
for
any
one
member
or
any
one
session
.
<EOS>
some
say
that
such
a
measure
never
could
be
pass
,
because
the
unfinished
work
of
one
session
could
not
be
use
in
lessen
the
labour
of

next
.
<EOS>
everything
must
be
recommence
;
and
therefore
,
 
so
say
these
hopeless
one
,
 
the
penny
with
five
farthing
,
the
penny
of
which
a
hundred
would
make
ten
shilling
,
the
halcyon
penny
,
which
would
make
all
future
pecuniary
calculation
easy
to
the
mean
british
capacity
,
could
never
become
the
law
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
other
,
more
hopeful
,
be
willing
to
believe
that
gradually
the
thing
would
so
sink
into
the
mind
of
member
of
Parliament
,
of
writer
of
lead
article
,
and
of
the
active
public
generally
,
as
to
admit
of
certain
establish
axiom
be
take
as
establish
,
and
place
,
as
it
be
,
beyond
the
procrastinate
power
of
debate

<EOS>
It
may
,
for
instance
,
at
last
be
take
for
grant
that
a
decimal
system
be
desirable

so
that
a
month
or
two
of

nee
not

preliminary
question

<EOS>
but
this
period
have
not
as
yet
be
reach
,
and
it
be
think
by
the
entire
city
that
Mr.
Palliser
be
much
too
sanguine
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
probable
,
many
say
,
that
he
may
kill
himself
by
labour
which
would
be
herculean
in
all
but
success
,
and
that
no
financier
after
him
would
venture
to
face
the
task
.
<EOS>
It
behove
Lady
Glencora
to
see
that
her
hercule
do
not
kill
himself

in
this
state
of
affair
Lady
Glencora

into
whose
hand

custody

Mr.

's
uncle
,
the
duke
,
have
now
altogether
fall
,
 
have
a
divide
duty
between
Matching

London
.
<EOS>
when
the
member
of
Parliament
go
up
to
London
,
she
go
there
also
,
leave
some
half
-
dozen
friend
whom
she
could
trust
to
amuse
the
duke

but
she
soon
return

know
that
there
may
be
danger
in
a
long
absence

he
much
affect
the
company
of
Madame
Goesler

that
lady

kindness

him

incessant

there
may
still
be
danger

responsible

the
old
nobleman
should
do
nothing
,
in
the
feebleness
of
age
,
to
derogate
from
the
splendour
of
his
past
life
.
<EOS>
what
if
some
day
his
grace
should
be
off
to
Paris
and
insist
on
make
Madame
Goesler
a
duchess
in
the
chapel
of
the
Embassy
!
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
have
hitherto
behave
very
well
;
 
would
probably
continue
to
behave
well
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
really
love
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
but
then
the
interest
at
stake
be
very
great
!
<EOS>
so
circumstance
,
Lady
Glencora
find
herself
compel
to
be
often
on
the
road
between
Matching
and
London
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
she
be
burthen
with
great
care
,
Lady
Glencora
by
no
means
drop
her
interest
in
the
Eustace
diamond
;
and
when
she
learn
that
on
the
top
of
the
great
Carlisle
robbery
a
second
robbery
have
be
superadde
,
and
that
this
have
be
achieve
while
all
the
London
police
be
yet
astray
about
the
former
operation
,
her
solicitude
be
of
course
enhance
.
<EOS>
the
duke
himself
,
too
,
take
the
matter
up
so
strongly
,
that
he
almost
want
to
be
carry
up
to
London
,
with
some
view
,
as
it
be
suppose
by
the
lady
who
be
so
good
to
him
,
of
see
Lady
Eustace
personally
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
out
of
the
question
,
my
dear
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
to
Madame
Goesler
,
when
the
duke
's
fancy
be
first
mention
to
her
by
that
lady
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
that
the
trouble
would
be
too
much
for
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
would
be
too
much
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
out
of
the
question
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
after
a
moment
,
she
add
in
a
whisper
,
"
who
know
but
what
he
would
insist
on
marry
her
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
every
woman
that
can
resist
temptation
.
"
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
smile
,
and
shake
her
head
,
but
make
no
answer
to
Lady
Glencora
's
suggestion
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
assure
her
uncle
that
everything
should
be
tell
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
write
about
it
daily
,
and
send
him
the
late
news
by
the
wire
if
the
post
should
be
too
slow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
;
 
yes
,
"
say
the
duke
;
"
I
like
telegram
best
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
you
know
,
that
that
Lord
George
Carruthers
have
have
something
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
,
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
"
It
have
long
be
evident
that
the
duke
be
anxious
that
one
of
his
own
order
should
be
prove
to
have
be
the
thief
,
as
the
plunder
take
be
so
lordly
.
  
<EOS>
in
regard
to
Lizzie
herself
,
Lady
Glencora
,
on
her
return
to
London
,
take
it
into
her
head
to
make
a
diversion
in
our
heroine
's
favour
.
<EOS>
It
have
hitherto
be
a
matter
of
faith
with
all
the
liberal
party
that
Lady
Eustace
have
have
something
to
do
with
steal
her
own
diamond
.
<EOS>
that
esprit
de
corps
which
be
the
glorious
characteristic
of
english
statesman
have
cause
the
whole
government
to
support
Lord
Fawn
,
and
Lord
Fawn
could
only
be
support
on
the
supposition
that
Lizzie
Eustace
have
be
a
wicked
culprit
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Glencora
,
though
very
true
as
a
politician
,
be
apt
to
have
opinion
of
her
own
,
and
to
take
certain
flight
in
which
she
choose
that
other
of
the
party
should
follow
her
.
<EOS>
She
now
express
an
opinion
that
Lady
Eustace
be
a
victim
,
and
all
the
Mrs.
Bonteens
,
with
some
even
of
the
Mr.
Bonteens
,
find
themselves
compel
to
agree
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
stand
too
high
among
her
set
to
be
subject
to
that
obedience
which
restrain
other
,
 
too
high
,
also
,
for
other
to
resist
her
leading
.
<EOS>
as
a
member
of
a
party
she
be
erratic
and
dangerous
,
but
from
her
position
and
peculiar
temperament
she
be
powerful
.
<EOS>
when
she
declare
that
poor
Lady
Eustace
be
a
victim
,
other
be
oblige
to
say
so
too
.
<EOS>
this
be
particularly
hard
upon
Lord
Fawn
,
and
the
more
so
as
Lady
Glencora
take
upon
her
to
assert
that
Lord
Fawn
have
no
right
to
jilt
the
young
woman
.
<EOS>
and
Lady
Glencora
have
this
to
support
her
view
,
 
that
,
for
the
last
week
past
,
indeed
ever
since
the
deposition
which
have
be
take
after
the
robbery
in
Hertford
Street
,
the
police
have
express
no
fresh
suspicion
in
regard
to
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
hear
daily
from
Barrington
Erle
that
Major
Mackintosh
and
Bunfit
and
Gager
be
as
active
as
ever
in
their
inquiry
,
that
all
Scotland
Yard
be
determined
to
unravel
the
mystery
,
and
that
there
be
emissary
at
work
track
the
diamond
at
Hamburg
,
Paris
,
Vienna
,
and
New
York
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
whisper
to
Mr.
Erle
that
the
whereabouts
of
Patience
Crabstick
have
be
discover
,
and
that
many
of
the
lead
thief
in
London
be
assist
the
police
;
 
but
nothing
more
be
do
in
the
way
of
fix
any
guilt
upon
Lizzie
Eustace
.
"
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
I
be
begin
to
think
that
she
have
be
more
sin
against
than
sin
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
say
to
Lady
Glencora
on
the
morning
after
Mr.
Palliser
's
great
speech
about
the
five
farthing
,
by
Barrington
Erle
,
who
,
as
it
seem
,
have
be
specially
tell
off
by
the
party
to
watch
this
investigation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
she
have
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
so
ever
since
the
last
robbery
.
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
Slope
tell
me
yesterday
afternoon
that
Mr.
Camperdown
have
give
it
up
altogether
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
Slope
be
the
Solicitor
-
General
of
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
absurd
for
him
to
go
on
with
his
bill
in
Chancery
now
that
the
diamond
be
go
,
 
unless
he
mean
to
make
her
pay
for
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
would
be
rank
persecution
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
have
be
persecute
.
<EOS>
I
shall
call
upon
her
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
write
the
following
letter
to
the
duke
:
    
February
14
,
18
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
duke
,
  
Plantagenet
be
on
his
leg
last
night
for
three
hour
and
three
quarter
,
and
I
sit
through
it
all
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
could
observe
through
the
bar
<EOS>
I
be
the
only
person
in
the
House
who
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
Mr.
Gresham
be
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
piteous
to
see
some
of
them
yawn
.
<EOS>
Plantagenet
do
it
very
well
,
and
I
almost
think
I
understand
him
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
say
that
nobody
on
the
other
side
will
take
trouble
enough
to
make
a
regular
opposition
,
but
that
there
be
man
in
the
City
who
will
write
letter
to
the
newspaper
,
and
get
up
a
sort
of
bank
clamour
.
<EOS>
Plantagenet
say
nothing
about
it
,
but
there
be
a
do
-
or
-
die
manner
with
him
which
be
quite
tragical
.
<EOS>
the
House
be
up
at
eleven
,
when
he
come
home
and
eat
three
oyster
,
drank
a
glass
of
beer
,
and
sleep
well
.
<EOS>
They
say
the
real
work
will
come
when
it
be
in
Committee
;
 
that
is
,
if
it
get
there
.
<EOS>
the
bill
be
to
be
bring
in
,
and
will
be
read
the
first
time
next
Monday
week
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
robbery
,
I
believe
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
police
have
get
hold
of
the
young
woman
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
arrest
her
,
but
deal
with
her
in
a
friendly
sort
of
way
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
say
that
a
sergeant
be
to
marry
her
in
order
to
make
quite
sure
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
know
their
business
;
but
that
would
not
strike
me
as
be
the
safe
way
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
think
the
diamond
go
to
Paris
but
have
since
be
send
on
to
New
York
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
little
widow
,
I
do
believe
she
have
be
make
a
victim
.
<EOS>
She
first
lose
her
diamond
,
and
now
her
other
jewel
and
her
money
have
go
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
what
she
be
to
gain
by
treachery
,
and
I
think
she
have
be
ill
-
use
.
<EOS>
She
be
stay
at
the
house
of
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
but
all
the
same
I
shall
go
and
call
on
her
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
see
her
,
because
she
be
such
a
little
beauty
;
 
just
what
you
would
like
;
not
so
much
colour
as
our
friend
,
but
perfect
feature
,
with
infinite
play
,
 
not
perhaps
always
in
the
very
good
taste
;
but
then
we
can
not
have
everything
;
<EOS>
can
we
,
dear
duke
?
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
real
thief
;
 
of
course
you
must
burn
this
at
once
,
and
keep
it
strictly
private
as
come
from
me
;
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
that
delightful
Scotch
lord
manage
it
entirely
.
<EOS>
the
idea
be
,
that
he
do
it
on
commission
for
the
Jew
jeweller
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
he
have
money
enough
to
carry
it
out
himself
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
second
robbery
,
whether
he
have
or
have
not
a
hand
in
that
,
I
can
not
make
up
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
why
he
should
not
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
do
go
into
a
business
,
he
ought
to
make
the
good
of
it
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
it
be
a
poor
thing
after
the
diamond
;
but
still
it
be
worth
have
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
story
about
a
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
real
Sir
Griffin
,
as
you
will
find
by
the
peerage
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
marry
a
young
woman
,
and
our
Lord
George
insist
that
he
shall
marry
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
all
about
it
,
but
the
girl
live
in
the
same
house
with
Lady
Eustace
,
and
if
I
call
I
shall
find
out
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
Sir
Griffin
know
all
about
the
necklace
,
and
threaten
to
tell
unless
he
be
let
off
marry
.
<EOS>
I
rather
think
the
girl
be
Lord
George
's
daughter
,
so
that
there
be
a
thorough
complication
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
go
down
to
match
on
Saturday
.
<EOS>
if
anything
turn
up
before
that
,
I
will
write
again
,
or
send
a
message
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
Plantagenet
will
be
able
to
leave
London
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
must
be
back
on
Monday
,
and
that
he
lose
too
much
time
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
kiss
my
little
darling
for
me
,
 
<EOS>
[
the
darling
be
Lady
Glencora
's
child
,
and
the
duke
's
plaything
]
 
and
give
my
love
to
Madame
Max
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
do
not
see
much
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
most
affectionately
yours
,
  
glencora
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
Lady
Glencora
actually
do
call
in
Hertford
Street
,
and
see
our
friend
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
She
be
tell
by
the
servant
that
Lady
Eustace
be
in
bed
;
but
,
with
her
usual
persistence
,
she
ask
question
,
and
when
she
find
that
Lizzie
do
receive
visitor
in
her
room
,
she
send
up
her
card
.
<EOS>
the
compliment
be
one
much
too
great
to
be
refuse
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
stand
so
high
in
the
world
,
that
her
countenance
would
be
almost
as
valuable
as
another
lover
.
<EOS>
if
Lord
George
would
keep
her
secret
,
and
Lady
Glencora
would
be
her
friend
,
may
she
not
still
be
a
successful
woman
?
<EOS>
so
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
be
show
up
to
Lizzie
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
find
with
her
nice
nightcap
and
prettiest
handkerchief
,
with
a
volume
of
Tennyson
's
poetry
,
and
a
scent
-
bottle
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
it
behove
her
to
be
very
clever
at
this
interview
.
<EOS>
Her
instinct
tell
her
that
her
first
greeting
should
show
more
of
surprise
than
of
gratification
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
in
a
pretty
,
feminine
,
almost
childish
way
,
she
be
very
much
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
do
the
strange
thing
in
the
world
,
I
know
,
Lady
Eustace
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
mean
to
do
a
kind
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
have
not
meet
since
you
be
at
my
house
near
the
end
of
last
season
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
London
six
week
,
but
have
not
be
out
much
.
<EOS>
for
the
last
fortnight
I
have
be
in
bed
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
thing
to
trouble
me
so
much
that
they
have
make
me
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
have
hear
,
Lady
Eustace
,
and
I
have
just
come
to
offer
you
my
sympathy
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
tell
that
you
do
see
people
<EOS>
,
I
think
that
perhaps
you
would
admit
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
willingly
,
Lady
Glencora
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
,
of
course
,
of
your
terrible
loss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
loss
have
be
as
nothing
to
the
vexation
that
have
accompany
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
to
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
lady
have
lose
their
jewel
before
now
,
but
I
do
not
know
that
any
lady
before
me
have
ever
be
accuse
of
steal
them
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
no
accusation
,
surely
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
exactly
be
put
in
prison
,
Lady
Glencora
,
but
I
have
have
policeman
here
want
to
search
my
thing
;
 
and
<EOS>
then
you
know
yourself
what
report
have
be
spread
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
I
do
.
<EOS>
only
for
that
,
to
tell
you
plainly
,
I
should
hardly
have
be
here
now
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lady
Glencora
pour
out
her
sympathy
,
 
perhaps
with
more
eloquence
and
grace
than
discretion
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
at
any
rate
,
both
graceful
and
eloquent
.
"
<EOS>
as
for
the
loss
of
the
diamond
,
I
think
you
bear
it
wonderfully
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
could
imagine
how
little
I
care
about
it
!
"
say
Lizzie

not

her

allusion
to
the
great
currency
question

perhaps
you
may
have

all
that
come

<EOS>
Lizzie
,
of
course

repudiate
vehemently
any
idea
of
force
Lord

into
a
marriage
which
have
become
distasteful
to
him

let
the
reason

free

with
a
little
show
of
anger

<EOS>
but
all
this
Lady
Glencora
take
at
its
worth

<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
have
be
a
good
deal
knock
about
,
and
Lady
Glencora
do
not
doubt

that
she
would
be
very
glad
to
get
back
her
betrothed
husband

<EOS>
the
little
woman
have
suffer
hardship

so
think
Lady

a
good
thing
would
be
do
by
bring
her
into
fashion

and
set
the

up
again

<EOS>
as
to
Lord

the
fortune
be
there
,
as
good
now
as
it
have
be
when
he
first
seek
it
;
and
the
lady
be
very
pretty

a
baronet

widow
too

in

good
enough
for

with
four
thousand

a
history

<EOS>
Lady

determine
that
she
would
remake

<EOS>
"
I
think

you
know

friend

I

I
may
say
a
word
to

<EOS>
Lizzie
hesitate
for
a
moment
before
she
answer
,
and
then
remember
that
revenge
,
at
least
,
would
be
sweet
to
her

<EOS>
She
have
swear
that
she
would
be
revenge
upon

after
all
,
may
it
not
suit
her
good
to
carry
out
her
oath
by
marry
him
?
<EOS>
but
whether
so
or
otherwise
,
it
would
not
but
be
well
for
her
that
he
should
be
again
at
her
foot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
 
if
you
think
good
will
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
acquiescence
be
give
with
much
hesitation
;
 
but
the
circumstance
require
that
it
should
be
so
,
and
Lady
Glencora
fully
understand
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
when
she
take
her
leave
,
Lizzie
be
profuse
in
her
gratitude
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Lady
Glencora
,
it
have
be
so
good
of
you
to
come
.
<EOS>
pray
come
again
,
if
you
can
spare
me
another
moment
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
say
that
she
would
come
again
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
visit
she
have
ask
some
question
concern
Lucinda
and
Sir
Griffin
,
and
have
be
inform
that
that
marriage
be
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
a
hint
have
be
throw
out
as
to
Lucinda
's
parentage
;
 
but
Lizzie
have
not
understand
the
hint
,
and
the
question
have
not
be
press
.
   
<EOS>
quint
or
Semitenths
 
<EOS>
the
task
which
Lady
Glencora
have
take
upon
herself
be
not
a
very
easy
one
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
Lord
Fawn
be
a
man
subservient
to
the
leader
of
his
party
,
much
afraid
of
the
hard
judgment
of
those
with
whom
he
be
concern
,
painfully
open
to
impression
from
what
he
would
have
call
public
opinion
,
to
a
certain
extent
a
coward
,
most
anxious
to
do
right
so
that
he
may
not
be
accuse
of
be
in
the
wrong
,
 
and
at
the
same
time
gift
with
but
little
of
that
insight
into
thing
which
teach
man
to
know
what
be
right
and
what
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
have
perceive
all
this
,
feel
that
he
be
a
man
upon
whom
a
few
word
from
her
may
have
an
effect
.
<EOS>
but
even
Lady
Glencora
may
hesitate
to
tell
a
gentleman
that
he
ought
to
marry
a
lady
,
when
the
gentleman
have
already
declare
his
intention
of
not
marry
,
and
have
attempt
to
justify
his
decision
almost
publicly
by
a
reference
to
the
lady
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
almost
feel
that
she
have
undertake
too
much
as
she
turn
over
in
her
mind
<EOS>
the
mean
she
have
of
perform
her
promise
to
Lady
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
the
five
-
farthing
bill
have
be
lay
upon
the
table
on
a
Tuesday
,
and
be
to
be
read
the
first
time
on
the
follow
Monday
week
.
<EOS>
on
the
Wednesday
Lady
Glencora
have
write
to
the
duke
,
and
have
call
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
on
the
follow
Sunday
she
be
at
Matching
,
look
after
the
duke
;
 
but
she
return
to
London
on
the
Tuesday
,
and
on
the
Wednesday
there
be
a
little
dinner
at
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
,
give
avowedly
with
the
object
of
further
friendly
discussion
respect
the
new
Palliser
penny
.
<EOS>
the
prime
minister
be
to
be
there
,
and
Mr.
Bonteen
,
and
Barrington
Erle
,
and
those
special
member
of
the
Government
who
would
be
available
for
give
special
help
to
the
financial
Hercules
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
a
question
,
perhaps
of
no
great
practical
importance
,
have
occur
to
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
but
one
which
,
if
overlook
,
may
be
fatal
to
the
ultimate
success
of
the
measure
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
in
a
name
,
 
and
then
an
ounce
of
ridicule
be
often
more
potent
than
a
hundredweight
of
argument
.
<EOS>
by
what
denomination
should
the
fifth
part
of
a
penny
be
hereafter
know
?
<EOS>
some
one
have
,
ill
-
naturedly
,
whisper
to
Mr.
Palliser
that
a
farthing
mean
a
fourth
,
and
at
once
there
arise
a
new
trouble
,
which
for
a
time
bore
very
heavily
on
him
.
<EOS>
Should
he
boldly
disregard
the
original
meaning
of
the
useful
old
word
;
or
should
he
venture
on
the
danger
of
new
nomenclature
?
<EOS>
October
,
as
he
say
to
himself
,
be
still
the
tenth
month
of
the
year
,
November
the
eleventh
,
and
so
on
,
though
by
these
name
they
be
so
plainly
call
the
eighth
and
ninth
.
<EOS>
all
France
try
to
rid
itself
of
this
absurdity
,
and
fail
.
<EOS>
Should
he
stick
by
the
farthing
;
or
should
he
call
it
a
fifthing
,
a
quint
,
or
a
semitenth
?
<EOS>
"
there
be
the
"
fortnightly
Review
"
come
out
but
once
a
month
,
"
he
say
to
his
friend
Mr.
Bonteen
,
"
and
I
be
tell
that
it
do
very
well
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
,
who
be
a
rational
man
,
think
the
"
Review
"
would
do
better
if
it
be
call
by
a
more
rational
name
,
and
be
very
much
in
favour
of
"
a
quint
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
have
express
an
opinion
,
somewhat
off
-
hand
,
that
english
people
would
never
be
get
to
talk
about
quint
,
and
so
there
be
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
a
little
dinner
be
therefore
arrange
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
,
as
be
his
custom
in
such
matter
,
put
the
affair
of
the
dinner
into
his
wife
's
hand
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
tell
that
she
have
include
Lord
Fawn
among
the
guest
he
open
his
eye
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
who
may
be
good
enough
at
the
India
Office
,
know
literally
nothing
about
the
penny
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
take
it
as
the
great
compliment
in
the
world
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
pay
Lord
Fawn
a
compliment
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
matter
be
arrange
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
nice
little
dinner
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gresham
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
be
there
,
and
the
great
question
of
the
day
be
settle
in
two
minute
,
before
the
guest
go
out
of
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
stick
to
your
farthing
,
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quint
be
a
very
easy
word
,
"
say
Mr.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
squint
be
an
easy
,
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
,
with
all
a
prime
minister
's
jocose
authority
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
would
certainly
be
call
cock
-
eye
,
"
say
Barrington
Erle
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
of
the
sound
of
a
quarter
in
farthing
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
stick
to
the
old
word
,
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
matter
be
decide
while
Lady
Glencora
be
flattering
Lord
Fawn
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
have
finally
arrange
the
affair
of
the
Sawab
of
Mygawb
.
<EOS>
then
they
go
down
to
dinner
,
and
not
a
word
more
be
say
that
evening
about
the
new
penny
by
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
before
dinner
Lady
Glencora
have
exact
a
promise
from
Lord
Fawn
that
he
would
return
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
very
clever
at
such
work
,
and
say
nothing
then
of
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
want
her
guest
to
run
away
,
and
therefore
Lord
Fawn
,
 
Lord
Fawn
especially
,
 
must
stay
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
to
go
there
would
be
nothing
speak
of
all
the
evening
,
but
that
weary
new
penny
.
<EOS>
to
oblige
her
he
must
remain
;
 
and
,
of
course
,
he
do
remain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
whom
do
you
think
I
see
the
other
day
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
when
she
get
her
victim
into
a
corner
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
Lord
Fawn
have
no
idea
whom
she
may
have
see
.
<EOS>
up
to
that
moment
no
suspicion
of
what
be
come
upon
him
have
cross
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"
I
call
upon
poor
Lady
Eustace
,
and
find
her
in
bed
.
<EOS>
"
then
do
Lord
Fawn
blush
up
to
the
root
of
his
hair
,
and
for
a
moment
he
be
stricken
dumb
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
feel
for
her
so
much
!
<EOS>
I
think
she
have
be
so
hardly
use
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
oblige
to
say
something
.
<EOS>
"
My
name
have
,
of
course
,
be
much
mix
up
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Lord
Fawn
,
I
know
it
have
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
because
I
be
so
sure
of
your
high
-
minded
generosity
and
 
and
thorough
devotion
,
that
I
have
venture
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
there
be
nothing
you
would
wish
so
much
as
to
get
at
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
manner
of
story
have
be
tell
about
her
,
and
,
as
I
believe
,
without
the
slight
foundation
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
now
that
she
have
an
undoubted
right
to
keep
the
diamond
;
 
that
even
if
Sir
Florian
do
not
give
them
to
her
,
they
be
her
under
his
will
.
<EOS>
those
lawyer
have
give
up
all
idea
of
proceed
against
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
the
necklace
have
be
steal
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
altogether
independently
of
that
.
<EOS>
do
you
see
Mr.
Eustace
,
and
ask
him
if
what
I
say
be
not
true

<EOS>
if
it
have
not

her
own
she
would

be
responsible
for
the
value
,
even
though
it
be
steal
;
and
with
such
a
fortune
as
her
they
would
never
have
allow
her
to
escape
.
<EOS>
They
be
as
bitter
against
her
as
they
could
be
;
 
be
not
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Camperdown
think
that
the
property
should
be
give
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
;
 
that
be
the
man
's
name
;
a
horrid
man
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
that
he
be
really
most
cruel
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
because
a
lot
of
thief
have
get
about
her
,
 
after
the
diamond
,
you
know
,
like
fly
round
a
honey
-
pot
,
 
and
take
first
her
necklace
and
then
her
money
,
they
be
impudent
enough
to
say
that
she
have
steal
her
own
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
they
quite
say
that
,
Lady
Glencora

"
  
<EOS>
"
something
very
much
like
it
,
Lord
Fawn

have
no

in
my
own
mind

do
steal
all
the
thing

who

it

<EOS>
"
oh
,
 
one
must
not

name
in
such
an
affair
without
evidence

at
any
rate

she
have
be
very
badly
treat

I
shall
take
her
up

if
I

you

would
go
and
call
upon

I
would
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
owe
it
to
her

<EOS>
well
,
duke
,
what
do
you
think
of
Plantagenet
's
penny
now
?
<EOS>
Will
it
ever
be
worth
two
halfpence
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
question
be
ask
of
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
a
great
nobleman
whom
all
Liberals
love
,
and
a
member
of
the
Cabinet

<EOS>
He
have
come
in
since
dinner
,
and
have
be
ask
a
question
or
two
as
to
what
have

well
,
yes

if
properly
invest
I
think
it
will

<EOS>
I
be
glad
that
it

<EOS>
a
semitenth

never

form
of
money

<EOS>
We
hate
new
name
so
much

beyond
talking
of
fourpenny
bit

there

a
great
deal

You

them
Pallisers

Palls

anything

you

should
not

that
under

two
lollypop

three

they
say
it
never

this
session

in
the
next

who
say
so
?

do
not

such
a
prophetess
of
evil

Lady
Glencora

mean
to
be
in

next
three

see
Palliser

so

I
do

to

Lord

after
that
he
leave
the
room
as
quickly
as
he
could
,

escape
out
into
the
street

<EOS>
His
mind
be
very
much
disturb

<EOS>
if
Lady
Glencora
be
determined
to
take
up
the
cudgel
for
the
woman
he
have
reject
,
the
comfort

peace
of
his

would
be
over

He
know
well
enough
how
strong
be
Lady
Glencora

<EOS>
Job
's
comforter
 
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
Lady
Eustace
have
now
be
up
in
town
between
six
and
seven
week
,
and
the
record
of
their
doing
have
necessarily
deal
chiefly
with
robbery
and
the
rumour
of
robbery
.
<EOS>
but
at
interval
the
mind
of
the
two
lady
have
be
intent
on
other
thing
.
<EOS>
the
former
be
still
intent
on
marry
her
niece
,
Lucinda
Roanoke
,
to
Sir
Griffin
,
and
the
latter
have
never
for
a
moment
forget
the
imperative
duty
which
lie
upon
her
of
revenge
herself
upon
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
the
match
between
Sir
Griffin
and
Lucinda
be
still
to
be
a
match
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
persevere
in
the
tooth
both
of
the
gentleman
and
of
the
lady
,
and
still
promise
herself
success
.
<EOS>
and
our
Lizzie
,
in
the
midst
of
all
her
trouble
,
have
not
be
idle
.
<EOS>
in
do
her
justice
we
must
acknowledge
that
she
have
almost
abandon
the
hope
of
become
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
other
hope
and
other
ambition
have
come
upon
her
.
<EOS>
latterly
the
Corsair
have
be
all
in
all
to
her
,
 
with
exceptional
moment
in
which
she
tell
herself
that
her
heart
belong
exclusively
to
her
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
Fawn
's
offence
be
not
to
be
forget
,
and
she
continually
urge
upon
her
cousin
the
depth
of
the
wrong
which
she
have
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
part
of
Frank
Greystock
there
be
certainly
no
desire
to
let
the
Under
-
Secretary
escape
.
<EOS>
It
be
hope
that
the
reader
,
to
whom
every
tittle
of
this
story
have
be
tell
without
reserve
,
and
every
secret
unfolded
,
will
remember
that
other
be
not
treat
with
so
much
open
candour
.
<EOS>
the
reader
know
much
more
of
Lizzie
Eustace
than
do
her
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
He
,
indeed
,
be
not
quite
in
love
with
Lizzie
;
but
to
him
she
be
a
pretty
,
graceful
young
woman
,
to
whom
he
be
bind
by
many
tie
,
and
who
have
be
cruelly
injure
.
<EOS>
dangerous
she
be
doubtless
,
and
perhaps
a
little
artificial
.
<EOS>
to
have
have
her
marry
to
Lord
Fawn
would
have
be
a
good
thing
,
 
and
would
still
be
a
good
thing
.
<EOS>
accord
to
all
the
rule
know
in
such
matter
Lord
Fawn
be
bind
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
become
engaged
to
her
,
and
Lizzie
have
do
nothing
to
forfeit
her
engagement
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
necklace
,
 
the
plea
make
for
jilt
her
on
that
ground
be
a
disgraceful
pretext
.
<EOS>
everybody
be
begin
to
perceive
that
Mr.
Camperdown
would
never
have
succeed
in
get
the
diamond
from
her
,
even
if
they
have
not
be
steal
.
<EOS>
It
be
"
preposterous
,
"
as
Frank
say
over
and
over
again
to
his
friend
Herriot
,
that
a
man
when
he
be
engage
to
a
lady
,
should
take
upon
himself
to
judge
her
conduct
as
Lord
Fawn
have
do
,
 
and
then
ride
out
of
his
engagement
on
a
verdict
find
by
himself
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
therefore
willingly
display
alacrity
in
persecute
his
lordship
,
and
have
not
be
altogether
without
hope
that
he
may
drive
the
two
into
a
marriage
yet
,
 
in
spite
of
the
protestation
make
by
Lizzie
at
Portray
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
certainly
not
spend
a
happy
winter
.
<EOS>
between
Mrs.
Hittaway
on
one
side
and
Frank
Greystock
on
the
other
,
his
life
have
be
a
burthen
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
suggest
to
him
by
various
people
that
he
be
behave
badly
to
the
lady
,
 
who
be
represent
as
have
be
cruelly
misuse
by
fortune
and
by
himself
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
it
have
be
hint
to
him
,
that
nothing
be
too
bad
to
believe
of
Lizzie
Eustace
,
and
that
no
calamity
could
be
so
great
as
<EOS>
that
by
which
he
would
be
overwhelm
be
he
still
to
allow
himself
to
be
force
into
that
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
well
,
"
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
say
,
"
to
retire
to
Ireland
at
once
,
and
cultivate
your
demesne
in
Tipperary
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
grievous
sentence
,
and
one
which
have
greatly
excite
the
brother
's
wrath
;
 
but
it
have
show
how
very
strong
be
his
sister
's
opinion
against
the
lady
to
whom
he
have
unfortunately
offer
his
hand
.
<EOS>
then
there
come
to
him
a
letter
from
Mr.
Greystock
,
in
which
he
be
ask
for
his
"
write
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
a
proceeding
which
an
official
man
dislike
bad
than
another
,
it
be
a
demand
for
a
write
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
,
"
Frank
have
say
,
"
that
your
conduct
to
my
cousin
should
be
allow
to
drop
without
further
notice
.
<EOS>
her
have
be
without
reproach
.
<EOS>
Your
engagement
with
her
have
be
make
public
,
 
chiefly
by
you
,
and
it
be
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
be
treat
as
you
be
treat
her
,
and
that
your
lordship
should
escape
without
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
what
the
punishment
be
to
be
he
do
not
say
;
but
there
do
come
a
punishment
on
Lord
Fawn
from
the
eye
of
every
man
whose
eye
meet
his
own
,
and
in
the
tone
of
every
voice
that
address
him
.
<EOS>
the
look
of
the
very
clerk
in
the
India
Office
accuse
him
of
behave
badly
to
a
young
woman
,
and
the
doorkeeper
at
the
House
of
Lords
seem
to
glance
askance
at
him
.
<EOS>
and
now
Lady
Glencora
,
who
be
the
social
leader
of
his
own
party
,
the
feminine
pole
-
star
of
the
Liberal
heavens
,
the
most
popular
and
the
most
daring
woman
in
London
,
have
attack
him
personally
,
and
tell
him
that
he
ought
to
call
on
Lady
Eustace
!
  
<EOS>
let
it
not
for
a
moment
be
suppose
that
Lord
Fawn
be
without
conscience
in
the
matter
,
or
indifferent
to
moral
obligation
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
man
in
London
less
willing
to
behave
badly
to
a
young
woman
than
Lord
Fawn
;
or
one
who
would
more
diligently
struggle
to
get
back
to
the
right
path
,
if
convince
that
he
be
astray
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
one
who
detest
interference
in
his
private
matter
,
and
who
be
nearly
drive
mad
between
his
sister
and
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
when
he
leave
Lady
Glencora
's
house
he
walk
towards
his
own
abode
with
a
dark
cloud
upon
his
brow
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
first
very
angry
with
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
even
her
position
give
her
no
right
to
meddle
with
his
most
private
affair
as
she
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
would
resent
it
,
and
would
quarrel
with
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
what
right
could
she
have
to
advise
him
to
call
upon
any
woman
?
<EOS>
but
by
degree
this
wrath
die
away
,
and
give
place
to
fear
,
and
qualm
,
and
inward
question
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
have
find
a
change
in
general
opinion
about
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
take
upon
himself
with
a
high
hand
to
dissolve
his
own
engagement
,
everybody
have
,
as
he
think
,
acknowledge
that
Lizzie
Eustace
be
keep
property
which
do
not
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
now
people
talk
of
her
loss
as
though
the
diamond
have
be
undoubtedly
her
own
.
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
Lord
Fawn
take
an
opportunity
of
see
Mr.
Camperdown
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
lord
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
,
"
I
shall
wash
my
hand
of
the
matter
altogether
.
<EOS>
the
diamond
be
go
,
and
the
question
now
be
,
who
steal
them
,
and
where
be
they
?
<EOS>
in
our
business
we
can
not
meddle
with
such
question
as
those
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
drop
the
bill
in
Chancery
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
good
can
the
bill
do
us
when
the
diamond
be
go
?
<EOS>
if
Lady
Eustace
have
anything
to
do
with
the
robbery
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
suspect
her
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
my
lord
;
no
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
say
that
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
not
Lady
Eustace
that
I
suspect
.
<EOS>
She
have
get
into
bad
hand
,
perhaps
;
but
I
do
not
think
that
she
be
a
thief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
suggest
that
,
 
if
she
have
anything
to
do
with
the
robbery
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
well
;
 
yes
;
 
if
she
have
,
it
would
not
be
for
us
to
take
step
against
her
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
trustee
have
decide
that
they
will
do
nothing
more
,
and
my
hand
be
tie
.
<EOS>
if
the
minor
,
when
he
come
of
age
,
claim
the
property
from
them
,
they
will
prefer
to
replace
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
likely
;
but
that
be
what
they
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
if
it
be
an
heirloom
 
"
suggest
Lord
Fawn
,
go
back
to
the
old
claim
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
explode
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
be
quite
clear
about
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
end
of
the
filing
of
that
bill
in
Chancery
as
to
which
Mr.
Camperdown
have
be
so
very
enthusiastic
!
<EOS>
now
it
certainly
be
the
case
that
poor
Lord
Fawn
in
his
conduct
towards
Lizzie
have
trust
greatly
to
the
support
of
Mr.
Camperdown
's
legal
proceeding
.
<EOS>
the
world
could
hardly
have
expect
him
to
marry
a
woman
against
whom
a
bill
in
Chancery
be
be
carry
on
for
the
recovery
of
diamond
which
do
not
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
that
support
be
now
altogether
withdraw
from
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
acknowledge
that
the
necklace
be
not
an
heirloom
,
 
clearly
acknowledge
by
Mr.
Camperdown
!
<EOS>
and
even
Mr.
Camperdown
would
not
express
an
opinion
that
the
lady
have
steal
her
own
diamond
.
  
<EOS>
how
would
it
go
with
him
,
if
after
all
,
he
be
to
marry
her
?
<EOS>
the
bone
of
contention
between
them
have
at
any
rate
be
make
to
vanish
.
<EOS>
the
income
be
still
there
,
and
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
have
all
but
promise
her
friendship
.
<EOS>
as
he
enter
the
India
Office
on
his
return
from
Mr.
Camperdown
's
chamber
,
he
almost
think
that
that
would
be
the
good
way
out
of
his
difficulty
.
<EOS>
in
his
room
he
find
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Mr.
Hittaway
,
wait
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
necessary
that
a
man
should
have
some
friend
whom
he
can
trust
in
delicate
affair
,
and
Mr.
Hittaway
be
select
as
Lord
Fawn
's
friend
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
at
all
point
the
man
whom
Lord
Fawn
would
have
choose
,
but
for
their
close

perhaps
a
little
loud

and
too
apt

make
capital
out
of
every
incident
of
his
life

<EOS>
but
confidential
friend

the
circle
to

one

known

<EOS>
Mr.

He

<EOS>
Lord

himself
in

bury
his

<EOS>
"
I
be
dispose

to

<EOS>
Lord

face
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
the
thing
be
painful
,
 
very
painful
.
<EOS>
but
out
of
two
evil
one
should
choose
the
least
.
<EOS>
the
writer
of
this
letter
be
altogether
unable
to
carry
out
his
threat
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
can
the
man
do
to
him
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
ask
,
almost
snap
at
her
husband
as
she
do
so

"
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
continue
Mr.

<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
they
be

<EOS>
the
bill
in
Chancery
have
be
withdraw

and
it
be
my
belief
that
if
the
necklace
be
find
to

morrow
,
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
her
keep
it
,
 
just
as
she

<EOS>

but
it
be
an
heirloom

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

it
be
not

<EOS>
the
lawyer
be
all
wrong
about
it

<EOS>
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
lawyer
always
be
wrong

<EOS>
about
those
nine
lacs
of
rupee
for
the
Sawab
,
Finlay
be
all
wrong

<EOS>
Camperdown
own
that
he
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
if
,
after
all
,
the
diamond
be
her
,
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
what
I
be
to
do

<EOS>
thank
you
,
Hittaway
,
for
come
over
.
<EOS>
that
will
do
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
just
leave
that
ruffian
's
letter
,
and
I
will
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
consider
by
Mrs.
Hittaway
to
be
a
very
bad
state
of
thing
,
and
there
be
great
consternation
in
Warwick
Square
when
Mr.
Hittaway
tell
his
wife
this
new
story
of
her
brother
's
weakness
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
go
to
be
weak
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
intend
to
withdraw
her
opposition
to
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
go
to
be
frighten
by
Lizzie
Eustace
and
Frank
Greystock
,
 
know
as
she
do
that
they
be
lover
,
and
very
improper
lover
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
she
steal
them
herself
,
"
say
Mrs.
Hittaway
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
she
steal
her
own
money
afterwards
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
she
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
see
Frederic
in
his
grave
than
married
to
such
a
woman
as
that
.
<EOS>
man
do
not
know
how
sly
woman
can
be
;
 
that
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
and
Frederic
have
be
so
spoilt
among
them
down
at
Richmond
,
that
he
have
no
real
judgment
leave
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
he
mean
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
upon
my
word
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Mr.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
then
Mrs.
Hittaway
make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
at
once
write
a
letter
to
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
lord
about
London
in
those
day
,
 
or
,
rather
,
one
who
be
an
old
Liberal
but
a
young
lord
,
 
one
Lord
Mount
Thistle
,
who
have
sit
in
the
Cabinet
,
and
have
lately
be
make
a
peer
when
his
place

the
Cabinet
be
want

<EOS>
He
be
a
pompous
,
would
-
be
important
,
silly
old
man
,
well
acquaint
with
all
the
tradition
of
his
party
,
and
perhaps
,
on
that
account
,
useful
,
 
but
a
bore
,
and
very
apt
to
meddle
when
he
be
not
want
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
on
the
day
after
her
dinner
-
party
,
whisper
into
his
ear
that
Lord

into
trouble

word
of
caution

come
to
him
from
one
whom
he
respect
so
much
as
he
do
Lord

would
be
of
service
to
him

<EOS>
Lord
Mount

know
Lord
Fawn

declare
himself
at

to
be
quite
entitled

<EOS>
He
be
really

badly
to
Lady

say
Lady
Glencora
,
"

I
do

<EOS>
Lord

proud
of
a
commission
from
the
hand
of
Lady
Glencora

go
almost
at
once
to
his
old
friend
's
son
.
<EOS>
He
find
him
at
the
House
that
night
,
and
whisper
his
few
word
of
caution
in
one
of
the
lobby
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
will
excuse
me
,
Fawn

"
Lord
Mount

,

seem
to

quite
well
to

"
what

My

if
you

it
off

you

to
give
your
reason

<EOS>
She
have
a
right
to
demand

much
as
that

<EOS>
on
the
next
morning

Friday

there
come
to
him
the
note

Lady

have
recommend

<EOS>
It

very
short

have
you

He

arrange

that
he
could
throw
aside
his
engagement

that
the

it

His

<EOS>
but
on

Sunday
evening
he
find
another
note
from

<EOS>
"
You
will
hardly

"
<EOS>
some
answer
must
,
as
he
feel
,
be
make
to
her
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
he
think
of
ask
his
mother
to
call
;
 
but
he
at
once
see
that
by
do
so
he
may
lay
himself
open
to
terrible
ridicule
.
<EOS>
Could
he
induce
Lord
Mount
Thistle
to
be
his
Mercury
?
<EOS>
It
would
,
he
feel
,
be
quite
impossible
to
make
Lord
Mount
Thistle
understand
all
the
fact
of
his
position
.
<EOS>
His
sister
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
may
have
go
,
be
it
not
that
she
herself
be
violently
opposed
to
any
visit
.
<EOS>
the
more
he
think
of
it
the
more
convinced
he
become
that
,
should
it
be
know
that
he
have
receive
two
such
note
from
a
lady
and
that
he
have
not
answer
or
notice
them
,
the
world
would
judge
him
to
have
behave
badly
.
<EOS>
so
,
at
last
,
he
write
,
 
on
that
Sunday
evening
,
 
fix
a
somewhat
distant
day
for
his
visit
to
Hertford
Street

<EOS>
His
note
be
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
present
his
compliment
to
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
in
accordance
with
the
wish
express
in
Lady
Eustace
's
two
note
of
the
23rd
instant
and
this
date
,
Lord
Fawn
will
do
himself
the
honour
of
wait
upon
Lady
Eustace
on
Saturday
next
,
March
3rd
,
at
12
,
noon
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
think
that
under
circumstance
as
they
now
exist
,
no
further
personal
interview
could
lead
to
the
happiness
of
either
party
;

as
Lady
Eustace
think
otherwise
,
he
feel
himself
constrain
to
comply
with
her
desire

chance

again
address

He
lack
the
courage
to
tell
Lady
Glencora
to
mind
her
own
business

to
allow
him
to
do
the
same

<EOS>
have
she
be
a
little
less
great
than
she
be
,
 
either
as
regard
herself

her
husband

he
would
have
do
so

<EOS>
but
Lady
Glencora
be
the
social
queen
of

party

which
he
belong

be
Chancellor
of

would
some
day
be
Duke
of
Omnium

it

Lady

courage
be
very
great

her
impudence

this

the
robbery
at

Hertford
Street
take
place
on
the
30th
of
January
,
and
on
the
morning
of
the
28th
of
February
Bunfit
and
Gager
be
sit
together
in
a
melancholy
,
dark
little
room
in
Scotland
Yard
,
discuss
the
circumstance
of
that
nefarious
act
.
<EOS>
a
month
have
go
by
,
and
nobody
be
yet
in
custody
.
<EOS>
a
month
have
pass
since
that
second
robbery
;
but
nearly
eight
week
have
pass
since
the
robbery
at
Carlisle
,
and
even
that
be
still
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
the
newspaper
have
be
loud
in
their
condemnation
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
assert
over
and
over
again
that
in
no
other
civilised
country
in
the
world
could
so
great
an
amount
of
property
have
pass
through
the
hand
of
thief
without
leave
some
clue
by
which
the
police
would
have
make
their
way
to
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Major
Mackintosh
have
be
declare
to
be
altogether
incompetent
,
and
all
the
Bunfits
and
Gagers
of
the
force
have
be
speak
of
as
drone
and
mole
and
ostrich
.
<EOS>
They
be
idle
and
blind
,
and
so
stupid
as
to
think
that
,
when
they
see
nothing
,
other
see
less
.
<EOS>
the
major
,
who
be
a
broad
-
shouldered
,
philosophical
man
,
bear
all
this
as
though
it
be
,
of
necessity
,
a
part
of
the
burthen
of
his
profession
;
 
but
the
Bunfits
and
gager
be
very
angry
,
and
at
their
wit
"
end
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
occur
to
them
to
feel
animosity
against
the
newspaper
which
abuse
them
.
<EOS>
the
thief
who
would
not
be
catch
be
their
great
enemy
;
and
there
be
common
to
them
a
conviction
that
man
so
obstinate
as
these
thief
,
 
<EOS>
man
to
whom
a
large
amount
of
grace
and
liberty
for
indulgence
have
accrue
,
 
should
be
treat
with
uncommon
severity
when
they
be
catch
.
<EOS>
there
be
this
excuse
always
on
their
lip
,
 
<EOS>
that
have
it
be
an
affair
simply
of
thief
,
such
as
thief
<EOS>
ordinarily
be
,
everything
would
have
be
discover
long
since
;
 
but
when
lord
and
lady
with
title
come
to
be
mix
up
with
such
an
affair
,
 
folk
in
whose
house
a
policeman
can
not
have
his
will
at
search
and
brow
-
beating
,
 
<EOS>
how
be
a
detective
to
detect
anything
?
  
<EOS>
Bunfit
and
Gager
have
both
be
drive
to
recast
their
theory
as
to
the
great
Carlisle
affair
by
the
circumstance
of
the
later
affair
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
They
both
think
that
Lord
George
have
be
concern
in
the
robbery
;
 
that
,
indeed
,
have
now
become
the
general
opinion
of
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
doubtful
character
,
with
large
expense
,
and
with
no
recognised
mean
of
living
.
<EOS>
He
have
form
a
great
intimacy
with
Lady
Eustace
at
a
period
in
which
she
be
know
to
be
carry
these
diamond
about
with
her
,
have
be
stay
with
her
at
Portray
Castle
when
the
diamond
be
there
,
and
have
be
her
companion
on
the
journey
during
which
the
diamond
be
steal
.
<EOS>
the
only
man
in
London
suppose
to
be
capable
of
deal
advantageously
with
such
a
property
be
Harter
and
Benjamin
,
 
as
to
whom
it
be
know
that
they
be
conversant
with
the
existence
of
the
diamond
,
and
know
,
also
,
that
they
be
in
the
habit
of
have
dealing
with
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
moreover
,
know
that
Lord
George
have
be
closet
with
Mr.
Benjamin
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
in
London
.
<EOS>
these
thing
put
together
make
it
almost
a
certainty
that
Lord
George
have
be
concern
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Bunfit
have
always
be
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
Gager
,
though
differ
much
from
Bunfit
as
to
detail
,
have
never
be
unwilling
to
suspect
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
but
the
fact
know
could
not
be
get
to
dovetail
themselves
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
if
Lord
George
have
possess
himself
of
the
diamond
at
Carlisle
,
 
or
with
Lizzie
's
connivance
before
they
reach
Carlisle
,
 
then
,
why
have
there
be
a
second
robbery
?
<EOS>
Bunfit
,
who
be
very
profound
in
his
theory
,
suggest
that
the
second
robbery
be
an
additional
plant
,
get
up
with
the
view
of
throw
more
dust
into
the
eye
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
Patience
Crabstick
have
,
of
course
,
be
one
of
the
gang
throughout
,
and
she
have
now
be
allow
to
go
off
with
her
mistress
's
money
and
less
trinket
,
 
so
that
the
world
of
Scotland
Yard
may
be
throw
more
and
more
into
the
mire
of
ignorance
and
darkness
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
to
this
view
Gager
be
altogether
oppose
.
<EOS>
He
be
inclined
to
think
that
Lord
George
have
take
the
diamond
at
Carlisle
with
Lizzie
's
connivance
;
 
that
he
have
restore
them
in
London
to
her
keeping
,
find
the
suspicion
against
him
too
heavy
to
admit
of
his
dealing
with
them
,
 
and
that
now
he
have
steal
them
a
second
time
,
again
with
Lizzie
's
connivance
;
but
in
this
latter
point
Gager
do
not
pretend
to
the
assurance
of
any
conviction
.
  
<EOS>
but
Gager
at
the
present
moment
have
achieve
a
triumph
in
the
matter
which
he
be
not
at
all
dispose
to
share
with
his
eld
officer
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
on
the
whole
,
more
power
be
lose
than
gain
by
habit
of
secrecy
.
<EOS>
to
be
discreet
be
a
fine
thing
,
 
especially
for
a
policeman
;
but
when
discretion
be
carry
to
such
a
length
in
the
direction
of
self
-
confidence
as
to
produce
a
belief
that
no
aid
be
want
for
the
achievement
of
great
result
,
it
will
often
militate
against
all
achievement
.
<EOS>
have
Scotland
Yard
be
less
discreet
and
more
confidential
,
the
mystery
may
,
perhaps
,
have
be
sooner
unravelled
.
<EOS>
gager
at
this
very
moment
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
man
whom
he
know
could
,
 
and
would
,
if
operate
upon
duly
,
 
communicate
to
him
,
Gager
,
the
secret
of
the
present
whereabout
of
Patience
Crabstick
!
<EOS>
that
belief
be
a
great
possession
,
and
much
too
important
,
as
Gager
think
,
to
be
share
lightly
with
such
an
one
as
Mr.
Bunfit
,
 
a
thick
-
headed
sort
of
man
,
in
Gager
's
opinion
,
although
,
no
doubt
,
he
have
by
mean
of
industry
be
successful
in
some
difficult
case
.
  
<EOS>
"

Bunfit

<EOS>

you

what

<EOS>
there
be
not
nothing
so
bad

when
anything
be
up
against

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
He
will
stand
his
ground

He
will
not

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
as
he
will
,
Gager

<EOS>
It
be
a
rum
go
;
be
not
it
?
 
<EOS>
the
rumm
as
I
ever
see

<EOS>
"
this
remark
have
be
make
so
often
by
Mr.
Bunfit
,
that
Gager
have
become
almost
weary
of
hear
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh

what

from

to

a

in

from
between

well

what
be

<EOS>
It
never

clever

Mr.

when
that
be
all
do

why
do

<EOS>
no

do

what
you

You

well

what

<EOS>
Lord
George
,
he
go
to
Benjamin
,
but
he
be
not
go
to
take
the
diamond
with
him
.
<EOS>
He

he

not

<EOS>
any
way
he
be
not

on
that
morning

<EOS>
He
have
not
be
go
to
keep
the
diamond
about
him
,
not
since
what
be
up
at
Carlisle

<EOS>
so
he

the
diamond
back
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
she
have
"
em
all
along
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
it
be
so
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
see
my
way
upon
that
hypothesis
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
as
she
have
to
conceal
,
Gager
.
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
all
through
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
in
a
moment
when
I
see'd
her
faint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
have
a
deal
to
conceal
,
I
do
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
well
,
there
they
be
,
 
with
her
still
,
 
and
the
box
be
go
,
and
the
people
as
be
bring
the
lawsuit
,
Mr.
Camperdown
and
the
rest
of
"
em
,
be
off
their
tack
.
<EOS>
what
be
she
to
do
with
"
em
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
take
"
em
to
Benjamin
,
"
say
Bunfit
,
with
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
,
Mr.
Bunfit
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
quarrel
up
already
with
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
Benjamin
be
to
have
have
"
em
before
.
<EOS>
Benjamin
have
spend
a
goodish
bit
of
money
,
and
have
be
throw
over
rather
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
Benjamin
be
as
bad
as
Smiler
,
or
bad
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
Benjamin
let
on
to
Smiler
,
and
think
as
Smiler
be
too
many
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
there
be
a
few
word
between
him
and
Smiler
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
wonder
if
Smiler
do
not
threaten
to
punch
Benjamin
's
head
,
 
which
<EOS>
well
he
could
do
it
,
 
and
if
there
be
not
a
few
playful
remark
between
"
em
about
penal
servitude
for
life
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Mr.
Bunfit
,
it
could
not
have
be
pleasant
for
any
of
"
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
would
have
split
,
"

Bunfit

<EOS>
"
but
they
do
not
,
 
not
downright
.
<EOS>
well
,
 
there
we
be
.
<EOS>
the
diamond
be
with
the
lady

<EOS>
Lord

do
it
all
.
<EOS>
Lord
George

Lady
Eustace
,
 
they
be
keep
company
,
no

,
after
their
own
fashion
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
-
robbing

she
have
to
do
pretty
much
as
she

<EOS>
the
diamond

Lord

be
pretty
well
afraid

look
at

<EOS>
after
all
that
be
be
do
,
there
be
not
much
to
wonder
at
in
that
.

then
come
the
second

<EOS>

Lord

plan
that
too

ask
Bunfit

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
pretend
to
say
I
know

just
put
it
this
way

Mr.

of

the

let
in
by
the
woman
Crabstick

not

"
  
<EOS>

they

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
always
about
the

a
-
do
for
her
in
everything

<EOS>
say
she
go
to
Benjamin
and
tell
him
as
how
her
lady
still
have
the
necklace
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
put
up
the
second
robbery
.
<EOS>
then
you
would
have
it
all
round
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
Lord
George
would
have
lose
"
em

<EOS>
It
can
not

<EOS>
Lord
George

he
be
thick
as
thief
up
to
this
day

"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well

I
do
not

anything
against
that

Lord
George
know
as
she
have
"
em
;
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
would
give
"

back
to
her
to
keep

<EOS>
We
have
get
as
far
as
that
,
Mr.

I
think

ave

<EOS>
"
very
well

<EOS>
what
do
Lord

do
then
?
<EOS>
He
can
not
make
money
of
"
em
.
<EOS>
They
be
too
hot
for
his
finger
,
and
so
he
find
when
he
think
of
take
"
em
into
the
market
.
<EOS>
so
he
put
Benjamin
up
to
the
second
robbery

<EOS>
"
who
be
draw
it
fine
,
now

Gager

eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bunfit
,
I
be
not

as
I
have
get
the
truth
beyond
this
,
 
that
Benjamin
and
his
two
man
be
clean
do
at
Carlisle
,
that
Lord
George
and
his
lady
bring
the
jewel
up
to
town
between

em
,
and
that
the
party
who
do
not
get
"
em
at
Carlisle
try
their
hand
again
and
do
get
"
em
in
Hertford
Street

<EOS>
"
in
all
of
which
the
ingenious
Gager
would
have
be
right
,
if
he
could
have
keep
his
mind
clear
from
the
alluring
conviction
that
a
lord
have
be
the
chief
of
the
thief

<EOS>
"
We
shall
never
make
a
case
of
it
now

Bunfit
despondently

<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
try
it
on
all

<EOS>
late
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
,
when
London
have
already
be
give
over
to
the
gaslight
,
Mr.
Gager
,
have
dress
himself
especially
for
the
occasion
of
the
friendly
visit
which
he
intend
to
make
,
saunter
into
a
small
public
-
house
at
the
corner
of
Meek
Street
and
Pineapple
Court
,
which
locality
,
 
as
all
man
well
verse
with
London
be
aware
,
 
lie
within
one
minute
's
walk
of
the
top
of
Gray
's
Inn
Lane
.
<EOS>
Gager
,
during
his
conference
with
his
colleague
Bunfit

have
be
dress
in
plain
black
clothe
;
but
in
spite
of
his
plain
clothe
he
look
every
inch
a
policeman
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
stiffness
about
his
limb
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
sharpness
in
his
eye
,
which
,
in
the
conjunction
with
the
locality
in
which
he
be
place
,
declare
his
profession
beyond
the
possibility
of
mistake
.
<EOS>
nor
,
in
that
locality
,
would
he
have
desire
to
be
take
for
anything
else
.
<EOS>
but
as
he
enter
the
"
rise
Sun
"
in
Meek
Street
,
there
be
nothing
of
the
policeman
about
him
.
<EOS>
He
may
probably
have
be
take
for
a
bet
man
,
with
whom
the
world
have
latterly
go
well
enough
to
enable
him
to
maintain

easy

seem

"
<EOS>
well

"
  
<EOS>
"
six
penn'orth

you
please

say
the
pseudo
-
Howard
,
as
he
stroll
easily
into
an
inner
room
,
with
which
he
seem
to
be
quite
familiar
.
<EOS>
He
seat
himself
in
an
old
-
fashioned
wooden
arm
-
chair
,
gaze
up
at
the
gas
lamp
,
and
stir
his
liquor
slowly
.
<EOS>
occasionally
he
raise
the
glass
to
his
lip
,
but
he
do
not
seem
to
be
at
all
intent
upon
his
drinking
.
<EOS>
when
he
enter
the
room
,
there
have
be
a
gentleman

a
lady
there

whose
festive
moment
seem
to
be
disturb
by
some
slight
disagreement
;
but
Howard
,
as
he
gaze
at
the
lamp
,
pay
no
attention
to
them
whatever
.
<EOS>
They
soon
leave
the
room
,
their
quarrel
and
their
drink
finish
together
,
and
other
drop
in
and
out
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Howard
's
"
warm
"
must
almost
have
become
cold
,
so
long
do
he
sit
there
,
gaze
at
the
gas
lamp
rather
than
attend
to
his
brandy
and
water
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
do
he
speak
to
any
one
for
more
than
an
hour
,
and
not
a
sign
<EOS>
do
he
show
of
impatience
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
be
alone
;
 
but
have
not
be
so
for
above
a
minute
when
in
step
a
jaunty
<EOS>
little
man
,
certainly
not
more
than
five
foot
high
,
about
three
or
four
and
twenty
year
of
age
,
dress
with
great
care
,
with
his
trouser
stick
to
his
leg
,
with
a
french
chimney
-
pot
hat
on
his
head
,
very
much
peaked
fore
and
aft
and
closely
turn
up
at
the
side
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
bright
-
colour
silk
handkerchief
round
his
neck
,
and
a
white
shirt
,
of
which
the
collar
and
wristband
be
rather
large
and
longer
than
suit
the
small
dimension
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
wear
a
white
greatcoat
tight
button
round
his
waist
,
but
so
arrange
as
to
show
the
glory
of
the
coloured
handkerchief
;
and
in
his
hand
he
carry
a
diminutive
cane
with
a
little
silver
knob
.
<EOS>
He
step
airily
into
the
room
,
and
as
he
do
<EOS>
so
he
address
our
friend
the
policeman
with
much
cordiality
.

the
negus

good

Mr.

the

String

be

public

house
,
very
humble
in
appearance
,
in
the
outskirt
of
the
town
,
on
the
road
lead
to
Pegwell
Bay
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
Mr.
Gager
be
dress
in
his
ordinary
plain
clothe
,
and
though
the
policeman
's
calling
may
not
be
so
manifestly
declare
by
his
appearance
at
Ramsgate
as
it
be
in
Scotland
Yard
,
 
still
,
let
a
hint
in
that
direction
have
ever
be
give
,
and
the
ordinary
citizen
of
Ramsgate
would
at
once
be
convince
that
the
man
be
what
he
be
.
<EOS>
Gager
have
doubtless
consider
all
the
circumstance
of
his
day
's
work
carefully
,
and
have
determine
that
success
would
more
probably
attend
him
with
this
than
with
any
other
line
of
action
.
<EOS>
He
walk
at
once
into
the
house
,
and
ask
whether
a
young
woman
be
not
lodge
there
.
<EOS>
the
man
of
the
house
be
behind
the
bar
,
with
his

to
him
Gager
whisper
a
few
word

the

stand
dumb
for

moment

say
she

"
there
be

We
do
not

then
the
man
whisper
a
word
to
his

during
which
Gager
stand
among
the
customer
before
the
bar
with
an
easy
,
unembarrassed
air
.
"

well
,
what
be
the
odd
?
"

the
wife
.

"
there
be
not
anything

"
  
<EOS>
"
never
think
there

madam

Gager
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
there
be
nothing
wrong
as
I
know
of
with
the
young

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
the
husband
and
wife
consult
together
,
and
Mr.
Gager
be
ask
to
take
a
seat
in
a
little
parlour
,
while
the
woman
run
up
-
stair
for
half
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Gager
look
about
him
quickly
,
and
take
in
at
a
glance
the
system
of
the
construction
of
the
"
Fiddle
with
one
string
.
"
<EOS>
He
do
sit
down
in
the
little
parlour
,
with
the
door
open
,
and
remain
there
for
perhaps
a
couple
of
minute
.
<EOS>
then
he
go
to
the
front
door
,
and
glance
up
at
the
roof
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
right

the
keeper

house

"
<EOS>
She
be
not

go
to
get
away

<EOS>
She
be
not
just
very
well
,
and
she
be
a
-
lie
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
tell
her
,
with
my
regard
,
"
say
Gager
,
"
that
she
nee
not
be
a
bit
the
bad
because
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
the
man
look
at
him
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
"
You
tell
her
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
and
tell
her
,
too
,
the
quicker
the
well
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
gentleman
a
-
looking
after
her
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
would
better
be
off
before
he
come
.
<EOS>
"
the
message
be
take
up
to
the
lady
,
and
Gager
again
seat
himself
in
the
little
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
often
tell
that
all
be
fair
in
love
and
war
,
and
,
perhaps
,
the
operation
on
which
Mr.
Gager
be
now
intent
may
be
regard
as
warlike
.
<EOS>
but
he
now
take
advantage
of
a
certain
softness
in
the
character
of
the
lady
whom
he
wish
to
meet
,
which
hardly
seem
to
be
justifiable
even
in
a
policeman
.
<EOS>
when
Lizzie
's
tall
footman
have
be
in
trouble
about
the
necklace
,
a
photograph
have
be
take
from
him
which
have
not
be
restore
to
him
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
portrait
of
Patience
Crabstick
,
which
she
,
poor
girl
,
in
a
tender
moment
,
have
give
to
him
who
,
have
not
thing
go
roughly
with
them
,
be
to
have
be
her
lover
.
<EOS>
the
little
picture
have
fall
into
Gager
's
hand
,
and
he
now
pull
it
from
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
himself
have
never
visit
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
till
after
the
second
robbery
,
and
,
in
the
flesh
,
have
not
as
yet
see
Miss
Crabstick
;
but
he
have
study
her
face
carefully
,
expect
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
hope
,
that
he
may
some
day
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
personal
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
that
pleasure
be
now
about
to
come
to
him
,
and
he
prepare
himself
for
it
by
make
himself
intimate
with
the
line
of
the
lady
's
face
as
the
sun
have
portray
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
even
yet
some
delay
,
and
Mr.
Gager
more
than
once
testify
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
a
-
go
to
get
away
,
"
say
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
"
but
a
lady
as
be
go
to
see
a
gentleman
can
not
jump
into
her
thing
as
a
man
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gager
intimate
his
acquiescence
in
all
this
,
and
again
wait
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
sooner
she
come
the
less
trouble
for
her
,
"
say
Gager
to
the
woman
;
"
if
you
will
only
make
her
believe
that
.
<EOS>
"
at
last
,
when
he
have
be
somewhat
over
an
hour
in
the
house
,
he
be
ask
to
walk
up
-
stair
,
and
then
,
in
a
little
sitting
-
room
over
the
bar
,
he
have
the
opportunity
,
so
much
desire
,
of
make
personal
acquaintance
with
Patience
Crabstick
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
imagine
that
the
poor
waiting
-
woman
have
not
be
in
a
happy
state
of
mind
since
she
have
be
tell
that
a
gentleman
be
wait
to
see
her
down
-
stair
,
who
have
declare
himself
to
be
a
policeman
immediately
on
enter
the
shop
.
<EOS>
to
escape
be
of
course
her
first
idea
,
but
she
be
soon
make
to
understand
that
this
be
impracticable
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
there
be
but
one
staircase
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
be
the
open
door
of
the
room
in
which
the
policeman
be
sit
;
and
then
,
the
woman
of
the
house
be
very
firm
in
declare
that
she
would
connive
at
nothing
which
may
cost
her
and
her
husband
their
licence
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
get
to
face
it
,
"
say
the
woman
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
can
not
make
me
get
out
of
bed
unless
I
please
,
"
say
Patience
firmly
.
<EOS>
but
she
know
that
even
that
resource
would
fail
her
,
and
that
a
policeman
,
when
aggravate
,
can
take
upon
him
all
the
duty
of
a
lady
's
maid
.
<EOS>
She
have
to
face
it
,
 
<EOS>
and
she
do
face
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
get
to
have
a
few
word
with
you
,
my
dear

"
say
Gager
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
then
,
we
would
better
be
alone
,
"
say
Patience
;
whereupon
the
woman
of
the
house
discreetly
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
interview
be
so
long
that
the
reader
would
be
fatigue
be
he
ask
to
study
a
record
of
all
that
be
say
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
and
lady
be
closet
together
for
more
than
an
hour
,
and
so
amicably
be
the
conversation
carry
on
that
when
the
time
be
half
over
Gager
step
down

stair
and
interest
himself
in

Miss
Crabstick

<EOS>
He
even
condescend
himself
to
pick
a
few
shrimp

drink
a
glass
of
beer
in
her
company

<EOS>
a
great

and
something

as
may
be

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

you
will
be
as
good

your
word

Mr.
Gager

"
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledge
that
Mr.
Gager
have
bid
high
for
success
,
and
have
allow
himself
to
be
carry
away
by
his
zeal
almost
to
the
verge
of
imprudence
.
<EOS>
It
be
essential
to
him
that
he
should
take
Patience
Crabstick
back
with
him
to
London
,
 
and
that
he
should
take
her
as
a
witness
and
not
as
a
criminal
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
be
the
game
at
which
he
be
fly
,
 
Mr.
Benjamin
,
and
,
if
possible
,
Lord
George
;
and
he
conceive
that
his
net
may
be
big
enough
to
hold
Smiler
as
well
as
the
other
two
great
fish
,
if
he
could
induce
Patience
Crabstick
and
Billy
Cann
to
co
-
operate
with
him
cordially
in
his
fishing
.
  
<EOS>
but
his
mind
be
still
disturb
on
one
point
.
<EOS>
let
him
press
his
beloved
Patience
as
closely
as
he
may
with
question
,
there
be
one
point
on
which
he
could
not
get
from
her
what
he
believe
to
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
She
persist
that
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
have
have
no
hand
in
either
robbery
,
and
Gager
have
so
firmly
commit
himself
to
a
belief
on
this
matter
,
that
he
could
not
throw
the
idea
away
from
him
,
even
on
the
testimony
of
Patience
Crabstick
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
evening
he
return
triumphant
to
Scotland
Yard
with
Patience
Crabstick
under
his
wing
;
and
that
lady
be
house
there
with
every
comfort
she
could
desire

that
of

this

she
do
it
with
a
zeal
that
deal
as
freely
with
Frank

as
with
Lizzie

.
<EOS>
They

with
all
their

probably
of

as
to
the
manner

little
history

the
great
fact

<EOS>
She
be
very
loud
in
her
denunciation

take
care
that
they
should
reach
even
Lady

be
on
his
journey
while
Mr.
Gager

<EOS>
It
be
at
present
the
great
object
of
Mrs.

's
life
to
induce
her
brother
to
see
Mr.

before

keep
his
appointment

hitherto
they
have
alight

let
a
shield
be
never
so
strong
,
it
may
at
last
be
batter
out
of
all
form

service

<EOS>
on
Lucy

shield
there
have
be
much
of
such
battering
,
and
the
blow
which
have
come
from
him
in
whom
she
most
trust

not

the
light
.
<EOS>
She
have
not

him
for
month

and
his
letter
be
short
,
unsatisfactory

and
rare

<EOS>
She
have
declare
to

that
no

no
absence

however

She

everybody

He

<EOS>
You
will
not

"
certainly
not

but
if
he
be
not
neglect
you

you
would
not
be
here

<EOS>
and
there
he
be
with
Lizzie
Eustace
every
day
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
afford
to
marry
you
,
and
he
can
afford
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
deal
better
that
you
should
look
it
all
in
the
face
and
know
what
it
must
all
come
to
.
<EOS>
"

It

that
I

have
to
pay

for

of
course

I
may
be
mistake

I

"
  
<EOS>
when
this
little
scene
take
place
,
only
a
month
remain
of
the
time
for
which
Lucy
's
service
be
engage
to
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
no
definite
arrangement
have
be
make
as
to
her
future
residence
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
be
prepared
to
give
her
a
home
,
and
to
Lady
Fawn
,
as
it
seem
,
she
must
go
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
have
declare
herself
unwilling
to
continue
the
exist
arrangement
because
,
as
she
say
,
it
do
not
suit
her
that
her
companion
should
be
engage
to
marry
her
late
sister
's
nephew
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
have
be
say
about
the
deanery
for
the
last
month
or
two
,
and
Lucy
,
though
her
hope
in
that
direction
have
once
be
good
,
be
far
too
high
-
spirit
to
make
any
suggestion
herself
as
to
her
reception
by
her
lover
's
family
.
<EOS>
in
the
ordinary
course
of
thing
she
would
have
to
look
out
for
another
situation
,
like
any
other
governess
in
want
of
a
place
;
but
she
could
do
this
only
by
consult
Lady
Fawn
;
and
Lady
Fawn
when
consult
would
always
settle
the
whole
matter
by
simply
bid
her
young
friend
to
come
to
Fawn
Court
.
  
<EOS>
there
must
be
some
end
of
her
live
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
so
much
Lucy
tell
herself
over
and
over
again
.
<EOS>
It
could
be
but
a
temporary
measure
.
<EOS>
if
 
if
it
be
to
be
her
fate
to
be
take
away
from
Fawn
Court
a
happy
,
glorious
,
triumphant
bride
,
then
the
additional
obligation
put
upon
her
by
her
dear
friend
would
not
be
more
than
she
could
bear
.
<EOS>
but
to
go
to
Fawn
Court
,
and
,
by
degree
,
to
have
it
acknowledge
that
another
place
must
be
find
for
her
,
would
be
very
bad
.
<EOS>
She
would
infinitely
prefer
any
intermediate
hardship
.
<EOS>
how
,
then
,
should
she
know
?
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
be
able
to
escape
from
the
countess
,
she
go
up
to
her
own
room
,
and
write
the
following
letter
.
<EOS>
She
study
the
word
with
great
care
as
she
write
them
,
 
sit
and
think
before
she
allow
her
pen
to
run
on
the
paper
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
FRANK
,
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
time
since
we
meet
;
 
be
it
not
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
write
this
as
a
reproach
;
but
because
my
friend
tell
me
that
I
should
not
continue
to
think
myself
engage
to
you
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
,
situate
as
you
be
,
you
can
not
afford
to
marry
a
penniless
girl
,
and
that
I
ought
not
to
wish
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
do
understand
enough
of
your
affair
to
know
that
an
imprudent
marriage
may
ruin
you
,
and
I
certainly
do
not
wish
to
be
the
cause
of
injury
to
you
.
<EOS>
all
I
ask
be
that
you
should
tell
me
the
truth
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
I
be
impatient
;
but
that
I
must
decide
what
to
do
with
myself
when
I
leave
Lady
Linlithgow
.

Your
most
affectionate
friend

LUCY
MORRIS

<EOS>
March
2
,
18
 
.
  
<EOS>
She
read
this
letter
over
and
over
again
,
think
of
all
that
it
say
and
of
all
that
it
omit
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
be
at
first
half
dispose
to
make
protestation
of
forgiveness
,
 
to
assure
him
that
not
even
within
her
own
heart
would
she
reproach
him
,
should
he
feel
himself
bind
to
retract
the
promise
he
have
make
her
.
<EOS>
She
long
to
break
out
into
love
,
but
so
to
express
her
love
that
her
lover
should
know
that
it
be
strong
enough
even
to
sacrifice
itself
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
but
though
her
heart
long
to
speak
freely
,
her
judgment
tell
her
that
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
be
reticent
and
tranquil
in
her
language
.
<EOS>
any
warmth
on
her
part
would
be
in
itself
a
reproach
to
him
.
<EOS>
if
she
really
wish
to
assist
him
in
extricate
himself
from
a
difficulty
into
which
he
have
fall
in
her
behalf
,
she
would
best
do
so
by
offer
him
his
freedom
in
the
few
and
plain
word
which
she
could
select
.
  
<EOS>
but
even
when
the
letter
be
write
she
doubt
as
to
the
wisdom
of
send
it
.
<EOS>
She
keep
it
that
she
may
sleep
upon
it
.
<EOS>
She
do
sleep
upon
it
,
 
and
<EOS>
when
the
morning
come
she
would
not
send
it
.
<EOS>
have
not
absolute
faith
in
her
lover
be
the
rock
on
which
she
have
declare
to
herself
that
she
would
build
the
house
of
her
future
hope
?
<EOS>
have
not
she
protest
again
and
again
that
no
caution
from
other
should
induce
her
to
waver
in
her
belief
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
her
great
doctrine
to
trust
,
 
to
trust
implicitly
,
even
though
all
should
be
lose
if
her
trust
should
be
misplace
?
<EOS>
and
be
it
well
that
she
should
depart
from
all
this
,
merely
because
it
may
be
convenient
for
her
to
make
arrangement
as
to
the
come
month
?
<EOS>
if
it
be
to
be
her
fate
to
be
reject
,
throw
over
,
and
deceive
,
of
what
use
to
her
could
be
any
future
arrangement
?
<EOS>
all
to
her
would
be
ruin
,
and
it
would
matter
to
her
nothing
<EOS>
whither
she
should
be
take
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
why
should
she
lie
to
him
as
she
would
lie
in
send
such
a
letter
?
<EOS>
if
he
do
throw
her
over
he
would
be
a
traitor
,
and
her
heart
would
be
full
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
his
future
lot
in
life
,
he
owe
it
to
her
to
share
it
with
her
,
and
if
he
evade
his
debt
he
would
be
a
traitor
and
a
miscreant
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
far
too
proud
to
condescend
to
spoken
or
write
reproach
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
know
that
it
would
be
so
,
and
why
should
she
lie
to
him
by
say
that
it
would
not
be
so
?
<EOS>
think
of
all
this
,
when
the
morning
come
,
she
leave
the
letter
lie
within
her
desk
.
  
<EOS>
Lord

<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
feel
that
he
would
lower
himself
by
any
intercourse
with
such
a
one
as
Andy
Gowran
in
regard
to
the
conduct
of
the
woman
whom
he
have
propose

make
his
wife
,
and
have
endeavour
to
avoid

He
have

piteous

haughty

black
silk
handkerchief

<EOS>
at
Portray
no
man
be
more
voluble
,
no
man
more
self
-
confident
,
no
man
more
equal
to
his
daily
occupation
than
Andy
Gowran
;
but
the
unaccustomed
clothe
,
and
the
journey
to
London
,
and
the
town
house
overcome
him
,
and
for
a
while
almost
silence
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
find
him
silent
,
cautious
,
and
timid
.
<EOS>
not
know
what
to
do
with
him
,
fear
to
ask
him
to
go
and
eat
in
the
kitchen
,
and
not
like
to
have
meat
and
unlimited
drink
bring
for
him
into
the
parlour
,
she
direct
the
servant
to
supply
him
with
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
couple
of
biscuit
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
an
hour
before
the
time
name
,
and
there
,
with
nothing
to
cheer
him
beyond
these
slight
creature
-
comfort
,
he
be
leave
to
wait
all
alone
till
Lord
Fawn
should
be
ready
to
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
Andy
have
see
lord
before
.
<EOS>
lord
be
not
rare
in
Ayrshire
than
in
other
Scotch
county
;
and
then
,
have
not
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
been
stay
at
Portray
half
the
winter
?
<EOS>
but
Lord
George
be
not
to
Andy
a
real
lord
,
 
and
then
a
lord
down
in
his
own
county
<EOS>
be
so
much
less
to
him
than
a
lord
up
in
London
.
<EOS>
and
this
lord
be
a
lord
of
Parliament
,
and
a
government
lord
,
and
may
probably
have
the
power
of
hang
such
a
one
as
Andy
Gowran
be
he
to
commit
perjury
,
or
say
anything
which
the
lord
may
choose
to
call
perjury
.
<EOS>
what
it
be
that
Lord
Fawn
wish
him
to
say
,
he
could
not
make
himself
sure
.
<EOS>
that
the
lord
's
sister
wish
him
to
prove
Lady
Eustace
to
be
all
that
be
bad
,
he
know
very
well
.
<EOS>
but
he
think
that
he
be
able
to
perceive
that
the
brother
and
sister
be
not
at
one
,
and
more
than
once
during
his
journey
up
to
London
<EOS>
he
have
almost
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
turn
tail
and
go
back
to
Portray
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
there
be
enmity
between
him
and
his
mistress
;
but
then
his
mistress
do
not
attempt
to
hurt
him
even
though
he
have
insult
her
grossly
;
and
be
she
to
tell
him
to
leave
her
service
,
it
would
be
from
Mr.
John
Eustace
,
and
not
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
that
he
must
look
for
the
continuation
of
his
employment
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
have
take
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
money
and
there
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
at
half
-
past
seven
Lord
Fawn
be
bring
into
the
room
by
his
sister
,
and
Andy
Gowran
,
rise
from
his

,
three
time
duck
his
head
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
,

say
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
"
my

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
Andy
again
duck

I
be
sure

<EOS>
then
Mrs.
Hittaway
leave
the
room
,
 
as
her

have
expressly
stipulate
that
she
should
do
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
begin
,
and
Andy
be
by
no

prepared
to

<EOS>

sorrow
that

that

"
<EOS>
Andy
nod
his
head
,
and
Lord
Fawn
perceive
that
he
be
nowhere
near
the
beginning
of
his
matter
.
"

"
<EOS>
Andy
again
nod
his
head
,
and
Lord
Fawn
again
struggle
to
find
some
way
in
which
he
may
approach
his
subject
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
have
be
stay
at
Portray
lately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
coothie
than
coosinly

"
say
Andy
,
wink
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
dreadful
to
Lord
Fawn
that
the
man
should
wink
his
eye
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
quite
understand
what
Andy
have
last
say
,
but
he
do
understand
that
some
accusation
as
to
indecent
familiarity
with
her
cousin
be
intend
to
be
bring
by
this
Scotch
steward
against
the
woman
to
whom
he
have
engage
himself
.
<EOS>
every
feeling
of
his
nature
revolt
against
the
task
before
him
,
and
he
find
that
on
trial
it
become
absolutely
impracticable
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
inquire
minutely
as
to
poor
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
flirt
down
among
the
rock
.
<EOS>
He
be
weak
,
and
foolish
,
and
in
many
respect
ignorant
,
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
as
he
get
near
to
the
point
which
it
have
be
intend
that
he
should
reach
,
the
more
he
hate
Andy
Gowran
,
 
and
<EOS>
the
more
he
hate
himself
for
have
submit
to
such
contact
.
<EOS>
He
pause
a
moment
,
and
then
he
declare
that
the
conversation
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
will
do
,
Mr.
Gowran
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
you
can
tell
me
anything
I
want
to
hear
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
better
go
back
to
Scotland
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
leave
Andy
alone
and
stalk
up
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
when
he
enter
it
,
both
Mr.
Hittaway
and
his
sister
be
there
.
"
<EOS>
Clara
,
"
he
say
very
sternly
,
"
you
have
better
send
some
one
to
dismiss
that
man
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
speak
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
do
not
speak
to
Andy
Gowran
again
,
but
Mrs.
Hittaway
do
.
<EOS>
after
a
faint
and
futile
endeavour
make
by
her
to
ascertain
what
have
take
place
in
the
parlour
down
-
stair
,
she
descend
and
find
Andy
seat
in
his
chair
,
still
hold
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
as
stiff
as
a
wax
figure
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
afraid
of
the
lord
,
but
as
soon
as
the
lord
have
leave
him
he
be
very
angry
with
the
lord
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
bring
up
all
that
way
to
tell
his
story
to
the
lord
,
and
the
lord
have
go
away
without
hear
a
word
of
it
<EOS>
,
 
have
go
away
and
have
absolutely
insult
him
,
have
ask
him
who
pay
him
his
wage
,
and
have
then
tell
him
that
Lady
Eustace
be
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
Andy
Gowran
feel
strongly
that
this
be
not
that
kind
of
confidential
usage
which
he
have
have
a
right
to
expect
.
<EOS>
and
after
his
experience
of
the
last
hour
and
a
half
,
he
do
not
at
all
relish
his
renew
solitude
in
that
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a

and
twa

that

what
she

<EOS>
"
It
be
thus
that
Andy
afterwards
speak
to
his
wife
of
the
hospitality
offer
to
him
in
Warwick
Square
,
regard
which
his
anger
be
especially
hot
,
in
that
he
have
be
treat
like
a
child
or
a
common
labourer
,
instead
of
have
the
decanter
leave
with
him
to
be
use
at
his
own
discretion
.
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
return
to
him
,
the
awe
with
which
new
circumstance
and
the
lord
have
fill
him
be
fast
vanish
,
and
give
place
to
that
stubborn
indignation
against
people
in
general
which
be
his
normal
,
condition
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
be

"
<EOS>
this
he
say
the
moment
the
lady
enter
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Hittaway
do
not
want
to
lose
his
service
quite
so
soon
.
<EOS>
She
express
regret
that
her
brother
should
have
find
himself
unable
to
discuss
a
subject
that
be
naturally
so
very
distasteful
to
him

and
beg
Mr.

to
come
to
her
again
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
all
this
be

with
so
much
unction
that
even
Mrs.
Hittaway
herself
find
it
to
be
not

<EOS>
She
shrink
and
shiver
under
Mr.

eloquence

and
almost
repent
of
her
zeal

<EOS>
but
woman
,
perhaps
,
feel
less
repugnance
than
do
man

use
ignoble
assistance

the
achievement

good
purpose

<EOS>
though
Mrs.

shrink
and
shiver
under
the
strong
action
with
which
Mr.
Gowran
garnish
his
strong
word
,
still
she
be
sure
of
the
excellence
of
her
purpose

and
,
believe
that
useful
aid
may
still
be
obtain
from
Andy
Gowran
,
and
,
perhaps
,
prudently
anxious
to
get
value
in
return
for
the
cost
of
the
journey
up
from
Ayrshire
<EOS>
,
she
make
the
man
promise
to
return
to
her
on
the
follow
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
let
It
be
as
though
It
have
never

between
her
son
,
and
her
married
daughter
,
and
Lucy
Morris
,
poor
Lady
Fawn
's
life
have
become
a
burthen
to
her
.
<EOS>
everything
be
astray
,
and
there
be
no
happiness
or
tranquillity
at
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
of
all
simply
human
creed
<EOS>
the
strong
existing
creed
for
the
present
in
the
mind
of
the
Fawn
lady
be
that
which
have
reference
to
the
general
iniquity
of
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
the
cause
of
all
these
sorrow
,
and
she
be
hate
so
much
the
more
because
she
have
not
be
prove
to
be
iniquitous
before
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
time
when
it
seem
to
be
admit
that
she
be
so
wicked
in
keep
the
diamond
in
opposition
to
the
continue
demand
make
for
them
by
Mr.
Camperdown
,
that
all
people
would
be
justify
in
drop
her
,
and
Lord
Fawn
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
but
since
the
two
robbery
,
public
opinion
have
veer
round
three
or
four
point
in
Lizzie
's
favour
,
and
people
be
begin
to
say
that
she
have
be
ill
-
use
.
<EOS>
then
have
come
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
evidence
as
to
Lizzie
's
wicked
doing
down
in
Scotland
,
 
the
wicked
doing
which
Andy
Gowran
have
describe
with
a
vehemence
so
terribly
moral
;
and
that
which
have
be
at
first
,
as
it
be
,
add
to
the
diamond
,
as
a
supplementary
weight
throw
into
the
scale
,
so
that
Lizzie
's
iniquity
may
bring
her
absolutely
to
the
ground
,
have
gradually
assume
the
position
of
be
the
first
charge
against
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
feel
no
aversion
to
discuss
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
when
Lizzie
be
call
a
"
thief
,
"
and
a
"
robber
,
"
and
a
"
swindler
"
by
one
or
another
of
the
lady
of
the
family
,
 
who
,
in
use
those
strong
term
,
whisper
the
word
as
lady
be
will
not
to
do
when
they
desire
to
lessen
the
impropriety
of
the
strength
of
their
language
by
the
gentleness
of
the
tone
in
which
the
word
be
speak
,
 
when
Lizzie
be
thus
describe
in
Lady
Fawn
's
hearing
in
her
own
house
,
she
have
feel
no
repugnance
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
that
the
fact
should
be
know
,
so
that
everybody
may
be
aware
that
her
son
be
do
right
in
refuse
to
marry
<EOS>
so
wicked
a
lady
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
other
thing
be
add
to
it
;
when
the
story
be
tell
of
what
Mr.
Gowran
have
see
among
the
rock
,
and
when
gradually
that
become
the
special
crime
which
be
to
justify
her
son
in
drop
the
lady
's
acquaintance
,
then
Lady
Fawn
become
very
unhappy
,
and
find
the
subject
to
be
,
as
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
describe
it
,
very
distasteful
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
trouble
hit
Lucy
Morris
as
hard
as
it
do
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
if
Lizzie
Eustace
be
unfit
to
marry
Lord
Fawn
because
of
these
thing
,
then
be
Frank
Greystock
not
only
unfit
to
marry
Lucy
,
but
most
unlikely
to
do
so
,
whether
fit
or
unfit
.
<EOS>
for
a
week
or
two
Lady
Fawn
have
allow
herself
to
share
Lucy
's
joy
,
and
to
believe
that
Mr.
Greystock
would
prove
himself
true
to
the
girl
whose
heart
he
have
make
all
his
own
;
 
but
she
have
soon
learn
to
distrust
the
young
member
of
Parliament
who
be
always
behave
insolently
to
her
son
,
who
spend
his
holiday
down
with
Lizzie
Eustace
,
who
never
visit
and
rarely
write
to
the
girl
he
have
promise
to
marry
,
and
as
to
whom
all
the
world
agree
in
say
that
he
be
far
too
much
in
debt
to
marry
any
woman
who
have
not
mean
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
sorrow
and
vexation
together
;
and
yet
when
her
married
daughter
would
press
the
subject
upon
her
,
and
demand
her
co
-
operation
,
she
have
no
power
of
escape

<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
"
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
say
,
"
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
have
be
with
her

everybody

take
her
up

if
her
conduct
down
in
Scotland

not
prove
,
Frederic
will
be
make
to
marry
her

"
<EOS>

but
what
can
I
do
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
ask
,
almost
in
tear

"
<EOS>
insist
that
Frederic
shall
know
the
whole
truth

"
reply
Mrs.
Hittaway
with
energy
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
it
be
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
nobody
can
feel
it
more
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
horrible
to
have
to
talk
about
such
thing
,
 
and
to
think
of
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
it
be
,
Clara
,
 
very
horrible
.
"
<EOS>
"
but
anything
,
mamma
,
be
well
than
that
Frederic
should
be
allow
to
marry
such
a
woman
as
that
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
prove
to
him
 
<EOS>
how
unfit
she
be
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
the
view
of
carry
out
this
intention
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
,
as
we
have
see
,
receive
Andy
Gowran
at
her
own
house
;
and
with
the
same
view
she
take
Andy
Gowran
the
follow
morning
down
to
Richmond
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
and
her
mother
,
and
Andy
be
closet
together
for
half
an
hour
,
and
Lady
Fawn
suffer
grievously
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
find
that
he
could
not
hear
the
story
,
and
he
have
not
hear
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
strong
enough
to
escape
,
and
have
,
upon
the
whole
,
get
the
good
of
it
in
the
slight
skirmish
which
have
take
place
between
him
and
the
Scotchman
;
but
poor
old
Lady
Fawn
could
not
escape
.
<EOS>
Andy
be
allow
to
be
eloquent
,
and
the
whole
story
be
tell
to
her
,
though
she
would
almost
sooner
have
be
flog
at
a
cart
's
tail
than
have
hear
it
.
<EOS>
then
"
rafrashment
"
be
administer
to
Andy
of
a
nature
which
make
him
prefer
Fawn
Court
to
Warwick
Square
,
and
he
be
tell
that
he
may
go
back
to
Portray
as
soon
as
he
please
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
Mrs.
Hittaway
open
her
mind
to
her
mother
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
mamma
,
that
Frederic
will
marry
her
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
why
?
<EOS>
I
think
that
he
have
declare
that
he
would
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
he
have
say
so
to
herself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
of
that
,
if
he
retract
what
he
say
?
<EOS>
He
be
so
weak
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
have
make
him
promise
to
go
and
see
her
;
and
he
be
to
go
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
He
be
there
now
,
probably
,
 
at
this
very
moment
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
firm
,
the
thing
be
do
.
<EOS>
after
all
that
have
take
place
,
nobody
would
ever
have
suppose
that
his
engagement
nee
go
for
anything
.
<EOS>
but
what
can
he
say
to
her
now
that
he
be
with
her
,
except
just
do
the
mischief
all
over
again
?
<EOS>
I
call
it
quite
wicked
in
that
woman
's
interfering
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
She
be
a
nasty
,
insolent
,
impertinent
creature
;
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
she
be
!
<EOS>
after
all
the
trouble
I
have
take
,
she
come
and
undo
it
all
with
one
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
we
do
,
Clara
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
I
do
believe
that
if
Frederic
could
be
make
to
act
as
he
ought
to
do
,
just
for
a
while
,
she
would
marry
her
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
and
then
there
would
be
an
end
of
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
really
think
that
she
like
him
good
,
and
from
all
that
I
can
hear
,
she
would
take
him
now
,
if
Frederic
would
only
keep
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
as
for
him
,
of
course
he
be
do
his
very
good
to
get
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
one
shill
to
rub
against
another
,
and
be
over
head
and
ear
in
debt
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Lucy
!
"
ejaculate
Lady
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
yes
;
but
really
that
be
a
matter
of
course

<EOS>
I
always
think
,
mamma

that
you
and
Amelia
be
a
little
wrong
to
coax
her
up
in
that
belief

,
my

the

We
all

<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
what
they
get
by
it
,
but
I
suppose
it
amuse
them
.
<EOS>
there
use
to
be
a
sort
of
feeling
that
if
a
man
behave
badly
something
would
be
do
to
him
;
but
that
be
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
a
man
may
propose
to
whom
he
like
,
and
if
he
choose
to
say
afterwards
that
it
do
not
mean
anything
,
there
be
nothing
in
the
world
to
bring
him
to
book

the

the

I

mamma

how
antediluvian
you
be

<EOS>
no

he
do
like
her
,
 
after
his
fashion
;
though
what
he
see
in
her
,
I
never
could
tell

<EOS>
I
think
Miss

would
make
a
very
nice
wife
for
a
country
clergyman
who
do
not
care
how
poor
thing
be

she
have
no
style
;

as
far
as
I
can
see

she
have
no
beauty

why
should
such
a
man
as
Frank
Greystock
tie
himself
by
the
leg

such
a

that

,

he

Would
he

be
go
on
in

way
with
his
cousin
down
in
Scotland

he
mean
it

<EOS>
He
mean
nothing
of
the
kind

<EOS>
He
mean
to
marry
Lady
Eustace
's
income
if
he
can
get
it
;
 
and
she
would
marry
him
before
the
summer
if
only
we
could
keep
Frederic
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
demand
from
her
mother
that
in
season
and
out
of
season
she
should
be
urgent
with
Lord
Fawn
,
impress
upon
him
the
necessity
of
wait
,
in
order
that
he
may
see
how
false
Lady
Eustace
be
to
him
;
and
also
that
she
should
teach
Lucy
Morris
how
vain
be
all
her
hope
.
<EOS>
if
Lucy
Morris
would
withdraw
her
claim
altogether
the
thing
may
probably
be
more
quickly
and
more
surely
manage
.
<EOS>
if
Lucy
could
be
induce
to
tell
Frank
that
she
withdraw
her
claim
,
and
that
she
see
how
impossible
it
be
that
they
should
ever
be
man
and
wife
,
then
,
 
so
argue
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
 
Frank
would
at
once
throw
himself
at
his
cousin
's
foot
,
and
all
the
difficulty
would
be
over
.
<EOS>
the
abominable
,
unjustifiable
,
and
insolent
interference
of
Lady
Glencora
just
at
the
present
moment
would
be
the
mean
of
undo
all
the
good
that
have
be
do
,
unless
it
could
be
neutralise
by
some
such
activity
as
this
.
<EOS>
the
necklace
have
absolutely
fade
away
into
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
sly
creature
be
almost
become
a
heroine
on
the
strength
of
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
the
very
mystery
with
which
the
robbery
be
pervade
be
act
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
would
absolutely
be
make
to
marry
her
,
 
force
into
it
by
Lady
Glencora
and
that
set
,
 
unless
the
love
affair
between
her
and
her
cousin
,
of
which
Andy
Gowran
be
able
to
give
such
sufficient
testimony
,
could
in

way

make
available
to
prevent
it

<EOS>
the
theory
of
life
and
system
on
which
social
matter
should
be
manage
,
as
display
by
her
married
daughter
,
be
very
painful
to
poor
old
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
tell
that
under
the
new
order
of
thing
promise
from
gentleman
be
not
to
be
look
upon
as
bind
,
that
love
be
to
go
for
nothing
,
that
girl
be
to
be
make
contented
by
be
tell
that
when
one
lover
be
lose
another
could
be
find
,
she
be
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
disbelieve
it
all
,
and
throw
herself
back
upon
her
faith
in
virtue
,
constancy
,
and
honesty
.
<EOS>
She
rather
think
that
thing
have
change
for
the
bad
since
she
be
young
,
and
that
promise
be
not
now
as
binding
as
they
use
to
be
.
<EOS>
She
herself
have
marry
into
a
liberal
family
,
have
a
liberal
son
,
and
would
have
call
herself
a
Liberal
;
but
she
could
not
fail
to
hear
from
other
,
her
neighbour
,
that
the
english
manner
,
and
English
principle
,
and
english
society
be
all
go
to
destruction
in
consequence
of
the
so

of

<EOS>
gentleman
,
she
think
,
certainly
do
do
thing
which
gentleman
would
not
have
do
forty
year
ago
;
and
as
for
lady
,
 
they
,
doubtless
,
be
change
altogether
.
<EOS>
most
assuredly
she
could
not
have
bring
an
Andy
Gowran
to
her
mother
to
tell
such
tale
in
their
joint
presence
as
this
man
have
tell
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
ridicule
her
for
say
that
poor
Lucy
would
die
when
force
to
give
up
her
lover
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
speak
of
the
necessity
of
break
up
that
engagement
without
a
word
of
anger
against
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
accord
to
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
view
Frank
Greystock
have
amuse
himself
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
when
he
ask
Lucy
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
a
governess
like
Lucy
have
be
quite
foolish
to
expect
that
such
a
man
as
Greystock
be
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
must
give
up
her
lover
;
and
if
there
must
be
blame
,
she
must
blame
herself
for
her
folly
!
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Lady
Fawn
be
so
soft
-
hearted
that
she
believe
that
the
sorrow
would
crush
Lucy
,
even
if
it
do
not
kill
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
not
the
less
be
it
her
duty
to
tell
Lucy
what
she
think
to
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
the
story
of
what
have
occur
among
the
rock
at
Portray
be
very
disagreeable
,
but
she
believe
it
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
be
make
love
to
his
cousin
after
his
engagement
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
be
it
not
quite
manifest
that
he
be
neglect
poor
Lucy
in
every
way
?
<EOS>
He
have
not
see
her
for
nearly
six
month
.
<EOS>
have
he
intend
to
marry
her
,
would
he
not
have
find
a
home
for
her
at
the
deanery
?
<EOS>
do
he
in
any
respect
treat
her
as
he
would
treat
the
girl
whom
he
intend
to
marry
?
<EOS>
put
all
these
thing
together
,
Lady
Fawn
think
that
she
see
that
Lucy
's
case
be
hopeless
;
 
and
,
so
think
,
write
to
her
the
following
letter
:
    
Fawn
Court
,
3rd
March
,
18
 
.
  
<EOS>
dearest
LUCY
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
so
much
to
say
to
you
that
I
do
think
of
get
Lady
Linlithgow
to
let
you
come
to
us
here
for
a
day
,
but
I
believe
it
will
perhaps
be
well
that
I
should
write
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
leave
Lady
Linlithgow
after
the
first
week
in
April
,
and
it
be
quite
necessary
that
you
should
come
to
some
fix
arrangement
as
to
the
future
.
<EOS>
if
that
be
all
,
there
need
not
be
any
trouble
,
as
you
will
come
here
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
this
be
your
natural
home
,
as
we
all
feel
;
and
I
must
say
that
we
have
miss
you
most
terribly
since
you
go
,
 
not
only
for
Cecilia
and
Nina
,
but
for
all
of
us
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
know
that
I
should
write
at
all
if
it
be
not
for
something
else
,
that
must
be
say
sooner
or
later
;
 
<EOS>
because
,
as
to
your
coming
here
in
April
,
that
be
so
much
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
the
only
mistake
be
,
that
you
should
ever
have
go
away
.
<EOS>
so
we
shall
expect
you
here
on
whatever
day
you
may
arrange
with
Lady
Linlithgow
as
to
leave
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
,
dear
lady
go
on
repeat
her
affectionate
invitation
,
because
of
the
difficulty
she
encounter
in
find
word
with
which
to
give
the
cruel
counsel
which
she
think
that
it
be
her
duty
to
offer
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
dear
Lucy
,
I
must
say
what
I
believe
to
be
the
truth
about
Mr.
Greystock
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
you
should
teach
yourself
to
forget
him
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
that
you
should
teach
yourself
to
forget
the
offer
which
he
make
to
you
last
autumn
.
<EOS>
whether
he
be
or
be
not
in
earnest
then
,
I
think
that
he
have
now
determine
to
forget
it
.
<EOS>
I
fear
there
be
no
doubt
that
he
have
be
make
love
to
his
cousin
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
You
well
know
that
I
should
not
mention
such
a
thing
,
if
I
have
not
the
strong
possible
ground
to
convince
me
that
I
ought
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
,
independent
of
this
,
his
conduct
to
you
during
the
last
six
month
have
be
such
as
to
make
us
all
feel
sure
that
the
engagement
be
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
probably
find
himself
so
place
that
he
can
not
marry
without
money
,
and
have
want
the
firmness
,
or
perhaps
you
will
say
the
hardness
of
heart
,
to
say
so
openly
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
of
this
,
and
so
be
Amelia
,
that
it
will
be
well
for
you
to
give
the
matter
up
altogether
,
and
to
come
here
and
recover
the
blow
among
friend
who
will
be
as
kind
to
you
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
know
all
that
you
will
feel
,
and
you
have
my
full
sympathy
;
but
even
such
sorrow
as
that
be
cure
by
time
,
and
by
the
mercy
of
God
,
which
be
not
only
infinite
,
but
all
-
powerful
.
  
<EOS>
Your
most
affectionate
friend
,
  
C.
FAWN

<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
when
she
have
write
her
letter
,
discuss
it
with
Amelia
,
and
the
two
together
agree
that
Lucy
would
never
surmount
the
ill
effect
of
the
blow
which
be
thus
prophesy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
to
say
it
will
kill
her
,
mamma
,
"
say
Amelia
,
"
I
do
not
believe
in
that
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
break
my
leg
,
the
accident
may
shorten
my
life
,
and
this
may
shorten
her
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
kill
her
in
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
but
it
will
alter
her
altogether
.
<EOS>
nobody
ever
use
to
make
herself
happy
so
easily
as
Lucy
Morris
;
but
all
that
will
be
go
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
Lucy
receive
the
letter
,
the
immediate
effect
upon
her
,
the
effect
which
come
from
the
first
reading
of
it
,
be
not
very
great
.
<EOS>
She
succeed
for
some
half
-
hour
in
put
it
aside
,
as
refer
to
a
subject
on
which
she
have
quite
make
up
her
mind
in
a
direction
contrary
to
that
indicate
by
her
correspondent
's
advice
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
tell
her
that
her
lover
intend
to
be
false
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
think
the
matter
over
very
carefully
within
the
last
day
or
two
,
and
have
altogether
make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
continue
to
trust
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
have
abstain
from
send
to
him
the
letter
which
she
have
write
,
and
have
abstain
on
that
resolution
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
,
of
course
,
be
as
kind
and
friendly
as
a
friend
could
be
.
<EOS>
She
love
Lady
Fawn
dearly
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
bind
to
think
Lady
Fawn
right
,
and
in
this
instance
she
do
not
think
Lady
Fawn
right
.
<EOS>
so
she
fold
up
the
letter
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
but
by
put
the
letter
into
her
pocket
she
could
not
put
it
out
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
though
she
have
resolve
,
of
what
use
to
her
be
a
resolution
in
which
she
could
not
trust
?
<EOS>
Day
have
pass
by
after
day
,
week
after
week
,
and
month
after
month
,
and
her
very
soul
within
her
have
become
sad
for
want
of
see
this
man
,
who
be
live
almost
in
the
next
street
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
ashamed
to
own
to
herself
<EOS>
how
many
hour
she
have
sit
at
the
window
,
think
that
,
perhaps
,
he
may
walk
before
the
house
in
which
he
know
that
she
be
immure
.
<EOS>
and
,
even
have
it
be
impossible
that
he
should
come
to
her
<EOS>
,
the
post
be
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
scorn
to
write
to
him
oftener
than
he
would
write
to
her
,
and
now
their
correspondence
have
dwindle
almost
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
know
as
well
as
do
Lady
Fawn
when
the
period
of
her
incarceration
in
Lady
Linlithgow
's
dungeon
would
come
to
an
end
;
and
he
know
,
too
,
how
great
have
be
her
hope
that
she
may
be
accept
as
a
guest
at
the
deanery
when
that
period
should
arrive
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
she
must
look
for
a
new
home
,
unless
he
would
tell
her
where
she
should
live
.
<EOS>
be
it
likely
,
 
be
it
possible
,
that
he
should
be
silent
so
long
if
he
still
intend
to
make
her
his
wife
?
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
have
come
to
remember
his
debt
,
to
remember
his
ambition
,
to
think
of
his
cousin
's
wealth
,
 
and
to
think
also
of
his
cousin
's
beauty
.
<EOS>
what
right
have
she
ever
have
to
hope
for
such
a
position
as
that
of
his
wife
,
 
she
who
have
neither
money
nor
beauty
,
 
she
who
have
nothing
to
give
him
in
return
for
his
name
and
the
shelter
of
his
house
beyond
her
mind
and
her
heart
?
<EOS>
as
she
think
of
it
all
,
she
look
down
upon
her
fade
grey
frock
,
and
stand
up
that
she
may
glance
at
her
feature
in
the
glass
;
and
she
see
how
small
she
be
and
insignificant
,
and
remind
herself
that
all
she
have
in
the
world
be
a
few
pound
which
she
have
save
and
be
still
save
in
order
that
she
may
go
to
him
with
decent
clothe
upon
her
back
.
<EOS>
be
it
reasonable
that
she
should
expect
it
?
  
<EOS>
but
why
have
he
come
to
her
and
make
her
thus
wretched
?
<EOS>
She
could
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
have
be
foolish
,
vain
,
utterly
ignorant
of
her
own
value
in
venture
to
hope
;
perhaps
unmaidenly
in
allow
it
to
be
see
that
she
have
hope
;
 
but
what
be
he
in
have
first
exalt
her
before
all
her
friend
,
and
then
abase
her
so
terribly
and
bring
her
to
such
utter
shipwreck
?
<EOS>
from
spoken
or
write
reproach
she
could
,
of
course
,
abstain
.
<EOS>
She
would
neither
write
nor
speak
any
;
 
but
from
unuttered
reproach
how
could
she
abstain
?
<EOS>
She
have
call
him
a
traitor
once
in
playful
,
love
irony
,
during
those
few
hour
in
which
her
love
have
be
to
her
a
luxury
that
she
could
enjoy
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
be
a
traitor
indeed
.
<EOS>
have
he
leave
her
alone
<EOS>
she
would
have
love
him
in
silence
,
and
not
have
be
wretche
in
her
love
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
she
know
,
in
that
case
,
have
have
vigour
enough
and
sufficient
strength
of
character
to
bear
her
burthen
without
outward
sign
of
suffering
,
without
any
inward
suffering
that
would
have
disturb
the
current
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
but
now
everything
be
over
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
thought
of
die
,
but
her
future
life
be
a
blank
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
come
down
-
stair
to
sit
at
lunch
with
Lady
Linlithgow
,
and
the
old
woman
do
not
perceive
that
anything
be
amiss
with
her
companion
.
<EOS>
further
news
have
be
hear
of
Lizzie
Eustace
,
and
of
Lord
Fawn
,
and
of
the
robbery
,
and
the
countess
declare
how
she
have
read
in
the
newspaper
that
one
man
be
already
in
custody
for
the
burglary
at
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
from
that
subject
she
go
on
to
tiding
which
have
reach
her
from
her
old
friend
Lady
Clantantram
that
the
Fawn
marriage
be
on
again
.
"
<EOS>
not
that
I
believe
it
,
my
dear
;
because
I
think
that
Mr.
Greystock
have
make
it
quite
safe
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
all
this
Lucy
hear
,
and
never
show
by
a
single
sign
,
or
by
a
motion
of
a
muscle
,
that
she
be
in
pain
.
<EOS>
then
Lady
Linlithgow
ask
her
what
she
mean
to
do
after
the
5th
of
April
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
at
all
why
you
should
not
stay
here
,
if
you
like
it
,
Miss
Morris
;
 
that
is
,
if
you
have
abandon
the
stupid
idea
of
an
engagement
with
Frank
Greystock
.
"
<EOS>
Lucy
smile
,
and
even
thank
the
countess
,
and
say
that
she
have
make
up
her
mind
to
go
back
to
Richmond
for
a
month
or
two
,
till
she
could
get
another
engagement
as
a
governess
.
<EOS>
then
she
return
to
her
room
and
sit
again
at
her
window
,
look
out
upon
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
what
do
it
matter
now
where
she
go
?
<EOS>
and
yet
she
must
go
somewhere
,
and
do
something
.
<EOS>
there
remain
to
her
the
wearisome
possession
of
herself
,
and
while
she
live
she
must
eat
,
and
have
clothe
,
and
require
shelter
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
dawdle
out
a
bitter
existence
under
Lady
Fawn
's
roof
,
eat
the
bread
of
charity
,
hang
about
the
room
and
shrubbery
useless
and
idle
.
<EOS>
how
bitter
to
her
be
that
possession
of
herself
,
as
she
feel
that
there
be
nothing
good
to
be
do
with
the
thing
so
possess
!
<EOS>
She
doubt
even
whether
ever
again
she
could
become
serviceable
as
a
governess
,
and
whether
the
energy
would
be
leave
to
her
of
earn
her
bread
by
teach
adequately
the
few
thing
that
she
know
.
<EOS>
but
she
must
make
the
attempt
,
 
and
must
go
on
make
it
,
till
God
in
his
mercy
should
take
her
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
but
a
few
month
since
life
have
be
so
sweet
to
her
!
<EOS>
as
she
feel
this
she
be
not
think
of
those
short
day
of
excited
,
feverish
bliss
in
which
she
have
believe
that
all
the
good
thing
of
the
world
be
to
be
shower
into
her
lap
;
but
of
previous
year
in
which
everything
have
be
with
her
as
it
be
now
,
 
with
the
one
exception
that
she
have
not
then
be
deceive
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
full
of
smile
,
and
humour
,
and
mirth
,
absolutely
happy
among
her
friend
,
though
conscious
of
the
necessity
of
earn
her
bread
by
the
exercise
of
a
most
precarious
profession
,
 
while
elate
by
no
hope
.
<EOS>
though
she
have
love
the
man
and
have
be
hopeless
,
she
be
happy
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
surely
,
of
all
maiden
and
of
all
woman
,
she
be
the
most
forlorn
.
  
<EOS>
have
once
accede
to
the
truth
of
Lady
Fawn
's
view
,
she
abandon
all
hope
.
<EOS>
everybody
say
so
,
and
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
word
from
any
side
to
encourage
her
.
<EOS>
the
thing
be
do
and
over
,
and
she
would
never
mention
his
name
again
.
<EOS>
She
would
simply
beg
of
all
the
Fawns
that
no
allusion
may
be
make
to
him
in
her
presence
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
blame
him
,
and
certainly
she
would
never
praise
him
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
she
could
rule
her
tongue
,
she
would
never
have
his
name
upon
her
lip
again
.
  
<EOS>
She
think
for
a
time
that
she
would
send
the
letter
which
she
have
already
write
.
<EOS>
any
other
letter
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
write
.
<EOS>
even
to
think
of
him
be
an
agony
to
her
;
but
to
communicate
her
thought
to
him
be
bad
than
agony
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
almost
madness
.
<EOS>
what
need
be
there
for
any
letter
?
<EOS>
if
the
thing
be
do
,
it
be
do
.
<EOS>
perhaps
there
remain
with
her
,
 
stay
by
her
without
her
own
knowledge
,
some
faint
spark
of
hope
,
that
even
yet
he
may
return
to
her
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
resolve
that
there
should
be
no
letter
,
and
she
destroy
that
which
she
have
write
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
do
write
a
note
to
Lady
Fawn
,
in
which
she
gratefully
accept
her
old
friend
's
kindness
till
such
time
as
she
could
"
find
a
place
.
"
<EOS>
"
as
to
that
other
subject
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
know
that
you
be
right
.
<EOS>
please
let
it
all
be
as
though
it
have
never
be
.

Lizzie
's
Great
friend
 
<EOS>
the
Saturday
morning
come
at
last
for
which
Lord
Fawn
have
make
his
appointment
with
Lizzie
,
and
a
very
important
day
it
be
in
Hertford
Street
,
 
chiefly
on
account
of
his
lordship
's
visit
,
but
also
in
respect
to
other
event
which
crowd
themselves
into
the
day
.
<EOS>
in
the
telling
of
our
tale
,
we
have
go
a
little
in
advance
of
this
,
as
it
be
not
till
the
subsequent
Monday
that
Lady
Linlithgow
read
in
the
newspaper
,
and
tell
Lucy
,
how
a
man
have
be
arrest
on
account
of
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
early
on
the
Saturday
morning
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
be
in
Hertford
Street
,
and
,
as
Lizzie
afterwards
understand
,
there
be
a
terrible
scene
between
both
him
and
Lucinda
and
him
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
She
see
nothing
of
it
herself
,
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
bring
her
the
tiding
.
<EOS>
for
the
last
few
day
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
be
very
affectionate
in
her
manner
to
Lizzie
,
thereby
show
a
great
change
;
for
during
nearly
the
whole
of
February
the
lady
,
who
in
fact
own
the
house
,
have
hardly
be
courteous
to
her
remunerative
guest
,
express
more
than
once
a
hint
that
the
arrangement
which
have
bring
them
together
have
better
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Lady
Eustace
,
"
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
once
say
,
"
the
trouble
about
these
robbery
be
almost
too
much
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
who
be
ill
at
the
time
,
and
still
tremble
with
constant
fear
on
account
of
the
lost
diamond
,
have
take
advantage
of
her
sick
condition
,
and
decline
to
argue
the
question
of
her
removal
.
<EOS>
now
she
be
suppose
to
be
convalescent
,
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
return
to
her
former
way
of
affection
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
there
be
cause
for
this
,
 
cause
that
be
patent
to
Lizzie
herself
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
have
call
,
 
which
thing
alone
be
feel
by
Lizzie
to
alter
her
position
altogether
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
though
her
diamond
be
go
,
and
though
the
thief
who
have
steal
them
be
undoubtedly
aware
of
her
secret
as
to
the
first
robbery
,
though
she
have
herself
tell
that
secret
to
Lord
George
,
whom
she
have
not
see
since
she
have
do
so
,
 
in
spite
of
all
these
cause
for
trouble
,
she
have
of
late
gradually
find
herself
to
be
emerge
from
the
state
of
despondency
into
which
she
have
fall
while
the
diamond
be
in
her
own
custody
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
be
regain
her
ascendancy
;
and
,
therefore
,
when
Mrs.
Carbuncle
come
to
tell
her
of
the
grievous
thing
which
have
be
say
down
-
stair
between
Sir
Griffin
and
his
mistress
,
and
to
consult
her
as
to
the
future
,
Lizzie
be
not
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
meaning
of
it
be
that
the
match
must
be
off
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
no
;
 
pray
do
not
say
anything
so
horrid
after
all
that
I
have
go
through
.
<EOS>
do
not
suggest
anything
of
that
kind
to
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
surely
after
what
you
have
tell
me
now
,
he
will
never
come
here
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
he
will
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
danger
about
his
come
back
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
sort
of
a
way
he
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
disagreeable
way
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
but
then
you
know
you
can
not
have
it
all
sweet
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
some
thing
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
can
learn
,
the
property
will
be
all
right
after
a
few
year
,
 
and
it
be
absolutely
indispensable
that
Lucinda
should
do
something
.
<EOS>
She
have
accept
him
,
and
she
must
go
on
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
seem
to
me
to
be
very
unhappy
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
always
her
way
.
<EOS>
She
be
never
gay
and
cheery
like
other
girl
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
know
her
once
to
be
what
you
would
call
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
like
hunting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
 
because
she
can
gallop
away
out
of
herself
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
all
I
can
for
her
,
and
she
must
go
on
with
the
marriage
now
.
<EOS>
as
for
go
back
,
it
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
we
could
not
afford
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
must
keep
him
in
a
well
humour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
so
much
afraid
about
him
;

,
dear
Lady
Eustace
,
we
want
you
to
help
us
a
little
.

<EOS>

how
can
I
help
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
Could
you
lend
me
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
,
just
for
six
week
?
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
's
face
fall
and
her
eye
become
very
serious
in
their
aspect
.
<EOS>
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
!
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
would
have
ample
security
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
give
Lucinda
her
present
till
I
have
pay
you
,
and
that
will
be
forty
-
five
pound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thirty
-
five
,
"
say
Lizzie
with
angry
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
agree
upon
forty
-
five
when
we
settle
about
the
servant

livery
;

then
you
can
let
the
man
at
the
stable
know
that
I
be
to
pay
for
the
carriage
and
horse
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
be
out
of
the
money
hardly
above
a
week

so
,

it
may
be
the
salvation
of
Lucinda

at
present

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
ask
Lord
George
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ask
Lord
George
!
<EOS>
He
have
not
get
it

<EOS>
It
be
much
more
likely
that

should
ask
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
be
come
to
Lord
George
this
last
month
past
.
<EOS>
I
do
believe
that
you
and
he
be
to
come
together
.
<EOS>
I
think
these
two
robbery
have
upset
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Lizzie
;
 
you
can
let
me
have
it
,
can
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
do
not
at
all
like
the
idea
of
lend
money
,
and
by
no
means
appreciate
the
security
now
offer
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
very
well
for
her
to
tell
the
man
at
the
stable
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
pay
him
her
bill
,
but
how
would
it
be
with
her
if
Mrs.
Carbuncle
do
not
pay
the
bill
?
<EOS>
and
as
for
her
present
to
Lucinda
,
 
which
be
to
have
be
a
present
,
and
regard
by
the
future
Lady
Tewett
as
a
voluntary
offering
of
good
-
will
and
affection
,
 
she
be
altogether
averse
to
have
it
disposed
of
in
this
fashion
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
do
not
like
to
make
an
enemy
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
be
so
poor
in
my
life
before
,
 
not
since
I
be
married
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
poor
,
dear
Lady
Eustace

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
take
my
money
out
of
my
desk

you

ever
so
much

<EOS>
"
forty
-
three
pound

Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
who
be
,
of
course
,
well
instructed
in
all
the
detail
of
the
robbery
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
do
not
suppose
you
can
guess
what
the
autumn
cost
me
at
Portray

<EOS>
the
bill
be
only
come
in
now
,

really
they
sometimes
so
frighten
me
that
I
do
not

what
I
shall
do

<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
not

the
money

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
every
penny

it
back
in
six
week

say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
upon
whose
face
a
glow
of
anger
be
settle
down
.
<EOS>
She
quite
intend
to
make
herself
very
disagreeable
to
her
"
dear
Lady
Eustace
"
or
her
"
dear
Lizzie
"
if
she
do
not
get
what
she
want
;
and
she
know
very
well
how
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
that
Lizzie
be
afraid
of
the
woman
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
impossible
for
her
not
to
be
afraid
of
the
people
with
whom
she
live
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
many
thing
against
her
;
 
so
many
source
of
fear
!
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
sure
you
will
not
refuse
me
such
a
trifling
favour
as
this
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
with
the
glow
of
anger
redden
more
and
more
upon
her
brow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
have
so
much
at
the
banker
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
let
you
overdraw
,
 
just
as
much
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
if
the
cheque
come
back
that
will
be
my
look
out
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
have
try
that
game
before
,
and
know
that
the
banker
would
allow
her
to
overdraw
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
be
a
good
friend
and
do
it
at
once
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
can
manage
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
tremble
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
fight
hard
for
the
great
sum
;
but
at
last
consent
to
take
the
less
,
and
the
cheque
be
write
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
,
of
course
,
will
not
interfere
with
Lucinda
's
present
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
"
as
we
can
make
all
this
right
by
the
horse
and
carriage
account
.
<EOS>
"
to
this
proposition
,
however
,
Lady
Eustace
make
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
lunch
,
at
which
meal
Miss
Roanoke
do
not
show
herself
,
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
be
announce
,
and
sit
for
about
ten
minute
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
have
come
,
she
say
,
especially
to
give
the
Duke
of
Omnium
's
compliment
to
Lady
Eustace
,
and
to
express
a
wish
on
the
part
of
the
duke
that
the
lost
diamond
may
be
recover
.
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
"
whether
there
be
any
one
in
England
except
profess
jeweller
who
know
so
much
about
diamond
as
his
grace
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
or
who
have
so
many
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
smile
graciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
about
that
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
be
family
diamond
,
though
I
have
never
see
them
.
<EOS>
but
he
sympathise
with
you
completely
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
be
hardly
hope
now
of
recover
them
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
smile
and
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
be
not
it
odd
that
they
never
should
have
discover
the
thief
?
<EOS>
I
be
tell
they
have
not
at
all
give
it
up
,
 
<EOS>
only
,
unfortunately
,
they
will
never
get
back
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
sit
there
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
then
,
as
she
take
her
leave
,
she
whisper
a
few
word
to
Lizzie
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
to
come
and
see
you
;
 
be
not
he
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
assent
with
a
smile
,
but
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
will
be
all
right
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
and
then
she
go
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
like
this
friendship
from
Lady
Glencora
amazingly
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
after
all
,
nothing
more
would
ever
be
know
about
the
diamond
,
and
they
would
simply
be
remember
as
have
add
a
peculiar
and
not
injurious
mystery
to
her
life
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
know
,
 
but
then
she
trust
that
a
benevolent
,
true
-
hearted
Corsair
,
such
as
be
Lord
George
,
would
never
tell
the
story
against
her
.
<EOS>
the
thief
know
,
 
but
surely
they
,
if
not
detect
,
would
never
tell
.
<EOS>
and
if
the
story
be
tell
by
thief
,
or
even
by
a
Corsair
,
at
any
rate
half
the
world
would
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
what
she
have
fear
,
 
have
fear
till
the
dread
have
nearly
overcome
her
,
 
be
public
exposure
at
the
hand
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
escape
that
,
the
world
may
still
be
bright
before
her
.
<EOS>
and
the
interest
take
in
her
by
such
person
as
the
Duke
of
Omnium
and
Lady
Glencora
<EOS>
be
evidence
not
only
that
she
have
escape
it
hitherto
,
but
also
that
she
be
in
a
fair
way
to
escape
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
three
week
ago
she
would
have
give
up
half
her
income
to
have
be
able
to
steal
out
of
London
without
leave
a
trace
behind
her
.
<EOS>
three
week
ago
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
treat
her
with
discourtesy
,
and
she
be
leave
alone
nearly
the
whole
day
in
her
sick
bedroom
.
<EOS>
thing
be
go
better
with
her
now
.
<EOS>
She
be
recover
her
position
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
,
who
have
be
the
first
to
attack
her
,
be
,
so
to
say
,
"
nowhere
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
acknowledge
himself
beat
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
whose
treatment
to
her
have
be
so
great
an
injury
,
be
come
to
see
her
that
very
day
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
Frank
,
though
he
have
never
offer
to
marry
her
,
be
more
affectionate
to
her
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
be
at
her
foot
that
morning
borrow
money
.
<EOS>
and
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
,
 
the
very
leading
star
of
fashion
,
 
have
call
upon
her
twice
!
<EOS>
why
should
she
succumb
?
<EOS>
She
have
an
income
of
four
thousand
pound
a
year
,
and
she
think
that
she
could
remember
that
her
aunt
,
Lady
Linlithgow
,
have
but
seven
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
with
all
her
daughter
have
not
near
so
much
as
she
have
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
beautiful
,
too
,
and
young
,
and
perfectly
free
to
do
what
she
please
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
the
last
eighteen
month
of
her
life
have
be
make
wretched
by
those
horrid
diamond
;
 
but
they
be
go
,
and
she
have
fair
reason
to
hope
that
the
very
knowledge
of
them
be
go
also
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
condition
would
it
be
expedient
for
her
to
accept
Lord
Fawn
when
he
come
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
of
course
,
be
sure
that
any
renew
offer
would
be
the
result
of
his
visit
;
 
but
she
think
it
probable
that
with
care
she
may
bring
him
to
that
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
come
to
her
if
he
himself
have
no
such
intention
?
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
quite
make
up
on
this
point
,
 
that
he
should
be
make
to
renew
his
offer
;
but
whether
she
would
renew
her
acceptance
be
quite
another
question
.
<EOS>
She
have
swear
to
her
cousin
Frank
that
she
would
never
do
so
,
and
she
have
swear
also
that
she
would
be
revenge
on
this
wretched
lord
.
<EOS>
now
would
be
her
opportunity
of
accomplish
her
revenge
,
and
of
prove
to
Frank
that
she
have
be
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
and
she
positively
dislike
the
man
.
<EOS>
that
,
probably
,
do
not
go
for
much
,
but
it
go
for
something
,
even
with
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
she
do
like
,
 
and
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
know
which
be
her
real
love
;
 
though
,
no
doubt
,
she
give
the
preference
greatly
to
her
cousin
,
because
she
could
trust
him
.
<EOS>
and
then
Lord
Fawn
be
very
poor
.
<EOS>
the
other
two
man
be
poor
also
;
but
their
poverty
be
not
so
objectionable
in
Lizzie
's
eye
as
be
the
respectable
,
close
-
fisted
economy
of
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
no
doubt
,
have
an
assured
income
and
a
real
peerage
,
and
could
make
her
a
peeress
.
<EOS>
as
she
think
of
it
all
,
she
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
great
deal
to
be
say
on
each
side
,
and
that
the
necessity
of
make
up
her
mind
then
and
<EOS>
there
be
a
heavy
burthen
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
exactly
at
the
hour
name
Lord
Fawn
come
,
and
Lizzie
be
,
of
course
,
find
alone
.
<EOS>
that
have
be
carefully
provide
.
<EOS>
He
be
show
up
,
and
she
receive
him
very
gracefully
.
<EOS>
She
be
sit
,
and
she
rise
from
her
chair
,
and
put
out
her
hand
for
him
to
take
.
<EOS>
She
speak
no
word
of
greeting
,
but
look
at
him
with
a
pleasant
smile
,
and
stand
for
a
few
second
with
her
hand

He
be
awkward

and
much
embarrassed

certainly

no

lessen
his
embarrassment

"
I
hope

I

Fawn

Will
you
not
sit
down

He
then
seat
himself
,
place
his
hat
beside
him
on
the
floor
,
but
at
the
moment
could
not
find
word
to
speak

I
have
be
very
ill

I
have
be
so
sorry

<EOS>
"
yes
,
 
I
know
that

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
it
be
very
terrible
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
I
have
be
threaten
with
a
lawsuit
.
<EOS>
You
have
hear
that
,
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
 
I
have
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
they
have
give
that
up
now

<EOS>
I
understand
from
my
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
who
have
be
my
true
friend
in
all
my
trouble
,
that
the
stupid
people
have
find
out
at
last
that
they
have
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
you
have
hear
that
,
Lord
Fawn
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
certainly
have
hear
,
in
a
doubtful
way
,
the
gist
of
Mr.
Dove
's
opinion
,
namely
,
that
the
necklace
could
not
be
claim
from
the
holder
of
it
as
an
heirloom
attach
to
the
Eustace
family
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
hear
at
the
same
time
that
Mr.
Camperdown
be
as
confident
as
ever
that
he
could
recover
the
property
by
claim
it
after
another
fashion
.
<EOS>
whether
or
no
that
claim
have
be
altogether
abandon
,
or
have
be
allow
to
fall
into
abeyance
because
of
the
absence
of
the
diamond
,
he
do
not
know
,
nor
do
any
one
know
,
 
Mr.
Camperdown
himself
have
come
to
no
decision
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
Fawn
have
be
aware
that
his
sister
have
of
late
shift
the
ground
of
her
inveterate
enmity
to
Lizzie
Eustace
,
make
use
of
the
scene
which
Mr.
Gowran
have
witness
,
in
lieu
of
the
lady
's
rapacity
in
regard
to
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
It
may
therefore
be
assume
,
Lord
Fawn
think
and
fear
,
that
his
strong
ground
in
regard
to
the
necklace
have
be
cut
from
under
his
foot
.
<EOS>
but
still
,
it
do
not
behove
him
to
confess
that
the
cause
which
he
have
always
allege
as
the
ground
for
his
retreat
from
the
engagement
be
no
cause
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
may
go
hard
with
him
<EOS>
should
an
attempt
be
make
to
force
him
to
name
another
cause
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
would
lack
the
courage
to
tell
the
lady
that
he
have
hear
from
his
sister
that
one
Andy
Gowran
have
witness
a
terrible
scene
down
among
the
rock
at
Portray
.
<EOS>
so
he
sit
silent
,
and
make
no
answer
to
Lizzie
's
first
assertion
respect
the
diamond
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
necklace
be
her
strong
point
,
and
she
do
not
intend
that
he
should
escape
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
remember
right
,
Lord
Fawn
,
you
yourself

that
wretched
old
attorney

unfortunately
for
Lord
Fawn

he
be
not
sure
that
he
could
justify
himself
.
<EOS>
the
diamond
be
go
,
and
the
action
be
lay
aside
,
and
the
general
opinion
which
have
prevail
a
month
or
two
since
,
that
Lizzie
have
be
disreputably
concern
in
steal
her
own
necklace

seem
to
have
be
lay
aside

<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
and
the
duke
go
for
almost
as
much
with
Lord

as
they
do
with
Lizzie

<EOS>
no
doubt
the
misbehaviour
down
among
the
rock
be
leave
to
him
;
but
he
have
that
only
on
the
evidence
of
Andy
Gowran
,
 
and
even
Andy
Gowran
's
evidence
he
have
decline
to
receive
otherwise
than
second
-
hand
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
too
,
be
prepare
with
an
answer
to
this
charge
,
 
an
answer
which
she
have
already
make
more
than
once
,
though
the
charge
be
not
positively
bring
against
her
,
and
which
consist
in
an
assertion
that
Frank
Greystock
be
her
brother
rather
than
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
such
brotherhood
be
not
altogether
satisfactory
to
Lord
Fawn
,
when
he
come
once
more
to
regard
Lizzie
Eustace
as
his
possible
future
wife
;
but
still
the
assertion
be
an
answer
,
and
one
that
he
could
not
altogether
reject
.
  
<EOS>
It
certainly
be
the
case
that
he
have
again
begin
to
think
what
would
be
the
result
of
a
marriage
with
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
He
must
sever
himself
altogether
from
Mrs.
Hittaway
,
and
must
relax
the
closeness
of
his
relation
with
Fawn
Court
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
a
wife
respect
whom
he
himself
have
spread
evil
tiding
,
and
the
man
whom
he
most
hate
in
the
world
would
be
his
wife
's
favourite
cousin
,
or
,
so
to
say
,
 
brother
.
<EOS>
He
would
,
after
a
fashion
,
be
connect
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
,
and
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
all
of
whom
he
regard
as
thoroughly
disreputable
.
<EOS>
and
,
moreover
,
at
his
own
country
house
at
Portray
,
as
in
such
case
it
would
be
,
his
own
bailiff
or
steward
would
be
the
man
who
have
see
 
what
he
have
see
.
<EOS>
these
be
great
objection
;
but
how
be
he
to
avoid
marry
her
?
<EOS>
He
be
engage
to
her
.
<EOS>
how
,
at
any
rate
,
be
he
to
escape
from
the
renewal
of
his
engagement
at
this
moment

<EOS>
He
have
more
than
once
positively
state
that
he
be
deter
from
marry
her
only
by
her
possession

the
diamond

now
go

,
wait
for
an
answer

her
question

Can
you
justify
yourself
in
your
own
heart

have
pause
for
some
second
,
she
repeat
her
question
in
a
strong
and
more
personal
form
.
"
<EOS>
have
I
be
your
sister

Lord
Fawn

have
another
man
behave
to
me

you
have
now
do

would
you
say
that
he
have
behave
well
,
and
that
she
have
no
ground
for
complaint

Can
you
bring
yourself
to

inquiry
you

do
me
the

make

to
throw
it
in

that
I
have

in

me
at
once
,
sir

whom
you

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
the
man
quail
before
her
.
<EOS>
and
it
certainly
be
not
too
much
to
say
that
,
have
Lizzie
Eustace
be
train
as
an
actress
,
she
would
have
become
a
favourite
with
the
town
.
<EOS>
when
there
come
to
her
any
fair
scope
for
act
,
she
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
in
the
ordinary
scene
of
ordinary
life
,
such
as
befell
her
during
her
visit
to
Fawn
Court
,
she
could
not
acquit
herself
well
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
reality
about
her
,
and
the
want
of
it
be
strangely
plain
to
most
unobservant
eye
.
<EOS>
but
give
her
a
part
to
play
that
require
exaggerated
,
strong
action
,
and
she
hardly
ever
fail
.
<EOS>
even
in
that
terrible
moment
,
when
,
on
her
return
from
the
theatre
,
she
think
that
the
police
have
discover
her
secret
about
the
diamond
,
though
she
nearly
sink
through
fear
,
she
still
carry
on
her
acting
in
the
presence
of
Lucinda
Roanoke
;
and
when
she
have
find
herself
constrain
to
tell
the
truth
to
Lord
George
Carruthers
,
the
power
to
personify
a
poor
,
weak
,
injured
creature
be
not
want
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
reader
will
not
think
that
her
position
in
society
at
the
present
moment
be
very
well
establish
,
 
will
feel
,
probably
,
that
she
must
still
have
know
herself
to
be
on
the
brink
of
social
ruin
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
now
fully
work
herself
up
to
the
necessity
of
the
occasion
,
and
be
as
able
to
play
her
part
as
well
as
any
actress
that
ever
walk
the
board
.
<EOS>
She
have
call
him
a
dastard
,
and
now
stand
look
him
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
anybody
in
particular
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
what
right
can
you
have
to
ask
me
whether
I
have
receive
attention

<EOS>
have
it
not
be
for
the
affectionate
attention
of
my
cousin
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
I
should
have
die
beneath
the
load
of
sorrow
you
have
heap
upon
me
!
"
<EOS>
this
she
say
quite
boldly
,
and
yet
the
man
she
name
be
he
of
whom
Andy
Gowran
tell
his
horrid
story
,
and
<EOS>
whose
love
-
making
to
Lizzie
have
,
in
Mrs.
Hittaway
's
opinion
,
be
sufficient
to
atone
for
any
fall
off
of
strength
in
the
matter
of
the
diamond
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
rumour
reach
me
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
pluck
up
his
courage
,
"
that
you
be
engage
to
marry
your

"
  
<EOS>
"
then
rumour
lie
,
my

he

she
who
repeat
the
rumour
to
you

lie
also
.
<EOS>

any
he

she
who
repeat
it
again
will
go
on
with
the
lie

"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
's
brow
become
very
black
.
<EOS>
the
word
"
lie
"
itself
be
offensive
to
him
,
 
offensive
,
even
though
it
may
not
be
apply
directly
to
himself
;
but
he
still
quail
,
and
be
unable
to
express
his
indignation
,
 
as
he
have
do
to
poor
Lucy
Morris
,
his
mother
's
governess
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
let
me
ask
,
Lord
Fawn
,
on
what
ground
you
<EOS>
and
I
stand
together
.
<EOS>
when
my
friend
,
Lady
Glencora
,
ask
me
,
only
this
morning
,
whether
my
engagement
with
you
be
still
an
exist
fact
,
and
bring
me
the
kind
possible
message
on
the
same
subject
from
her
uncle
,
the
duke
,
I
hardly
know
what
answer
to
make
her
.
"
<EOS>
It
be
not
surprising
that
Lizzie
in
her
difficulty
should
use
her
new
friend
,
but
perhaps
she
over
-
do
the
friendship
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
tell
her
that
we
be
engage
,
but
that
your
lordship
's
conduct
to
me
have
be
so
strange
,
that
I
hardly
know
how
to
speak
of
you
among
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
explain
myself
to
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
certainly
do
not
understand
your
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
certain
that
Greystock
have
understand
it
well
;
and
Greystock
have
in
return
insult
him
,
 
because
the
engagement
be
break
off
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
impossible
to
argue
on
fact
with
a
woman
who
have
be
ill
-
use
.
<EOS>
"
after
all
that
have
pass
,
perhaps
we
have
well
part
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
shall
put
the
matter
into
the
hand
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
"
say
Lizzie
boldly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
have
my
whole
life
ruin
,
my
good
name
blast
 
"
  
"
I
have
not
say
a
word
to
injure
your
good
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
what
plea
,
then
,
have
you
dare
to
take
upon
yourself
to
put
an
end
to
an
engagement
which
be
make
at
your
own
pressing
request
,
 
which
be
,
of
course
,
make
at
your
own
request
?
<EOS>
on
what
ground
do
you
justify
such
conduct
?
<EOS>
You
be
a
Liberal
,
Lord
Fawn
;
and
everybody
regard
the
Duke
of
Omnium
as
the
head
of
the
liberal
nobility
in
England
.
<EOS>
He
be
my
friend
,
and
I
shall
put
the
matter
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
probably
,
from
her
cousin
Frank
that
Lizzie
have
learn
that
Lord
Fawn
be
more
afraid
of
the
leader
of
his
own
party
than
of
any
other
tribunal
upon
earth
,
 
or
perhaps
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
feel
the
absurdity
of
the
threat
,
and
yet
it
have
effect
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
a
wear
-
out
old
debauchee
,
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
,
who
be
look
after
by
two
or
three
woman
who
be
only
anxious
that
he
should
not
disgrace
himself
by
some
absurdity
before
he
die
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
or
the
duke
's
name
,
be
a
power
in
the
nation
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
certainly
very
powerful
,
and
Lady
Glencora
's
husband
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
suppose
that
the
duke
care
in
the
least
whether
Lizzie
Eustace
be
or
be
not
married
;
 
but
Lady
Glencora
have
certainly
interested
herself
about
Lizzie
,
and
may
make
London
almost
too
hot
to
hold
him
if
she
choose
to
go
about
everywhere
say
that
he
ought
to
marry
the
lady
.
<EOS>
and
in
addition
to
all
this
prospective
grief
,
there
be
the
trouble
of
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
Lizzie
's
own
room
,
 
fool
that
he
have
be
to
come
there
,
 
and
he
must
get
out
as
best
he
could
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
be
most
anxious
not
to
behave
badly
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
behave
badly
,
 
very
badly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
with
your
leave
I
will
tell
you
what
I
would
suggest
.
<EOS>
I
will
submit
to
you
in
write
my
opinion
on
this
matter
;
"
 
Lord
Fawn
have
be
all
his
life
submit
his
opinion
in
writing
,
and
think
that
he
be
rather
a
good
hand
at
the
work
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
then
endeavour
to
explain
to
you
the
reason
which
make
me
think
that
it
will
be
well
for
us
both
that
our
engagement
should
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
if
,
after
read
it
,
you
shall
disagree
with
me
,
and
still
insist
on
the
right
which
I
give
you
when
I
ask
you
to
become
my
wife
,
 
I
will
then
perform
the
promise
which
I
certainly
make
.
"
<EOS>
to
this
most
foolish
proposal
on
his
part
,
Lizzie
,
of
course
,
acquiesce
.
<EOS>
She
acquiesce
,
and
bade
him
farewell
with
her
sweetest
smile
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
manifest
to
her
that
she
could
have
her
husband
,
 
or
her
revenge
,
just
as
she
may
prefer
.
  
<EOS>
this
have
be
a
day
of
triumph
to
her
,
and
she
be
talk
of
it
in
the
evening
triumphantly
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
when
she
be
tell
that
a
policeman
want
to
see
her
down
-
stair
!
<EOS>
oh
,
those
wretched
police
!
<EOS>
again
all
the
blood
rush
to
her
head
and
nearly
kill
her
.
<EOS>
She
descend
slowly
;
and
be
then
inform
by
a
man
,
not
dress
,
like
Bunfit
,
in
plain
clothe
,
but
with
all
the
paraphernalia
of
a
policeman
's
uniform
,
that
her
late
servant
,
Patience
Crabstick
,
have
give
herself
up
as
Queen
's
evidence
,
and
be
now
in
custody
in
Scotland
Yard
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
think
right
that
she
should
be
so
far
informed
;
but
the
man
be
able
to
tell
her
nothing
further
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
where
My
heart
be
"
 
on
the
Sunday
follow
,
Frank
,
as
usual
,
be
in
Hertford
Street

He
have
become
almost
a
favourite
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;

have
so
far
ingratiate
himself
even
with
Lucinda
Roanoke

to

's
report

may
,
if
so
inclined
,
rob
Sir
Griffin
of
his
prize
without
much
difficulty

<EOS>
on
this
occasion
he
be
unhappy
and
in
low
spirit

when
question
on
the
subject
make
no
secret

the
fact

harass
for

<EOS>
the
truth

my
banker

five
hundred

venture
to

I

not

so
often

fact
about
a
fortnight
ago

do
you

it
away

recklessness

none

hard
with

owe
us
large
sum
of
money

very
well

of
money
due

grandly

big

money
be
the

thing
I
think
of
,
when
I
be
long
to
touch
my
hat

ask
them
as
a
great
favour
to
settle
my
little
bill

"
all
this
time
Lizzie
be
full
of
matter
which
she
must
impart
to
her
cousin
,
and
could
impart
to
him
only
in
privacy
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
absolutely
necessary
that
she
should
tell
him
what
she
have
hear
of
Patience
Crabstick

<EOS>
in
her
heart
of
heart
she
wish
that
Patience
Crabstick
have
go
off
safely
with
her
plunder
to
the
Antipodes

have
no

get
back
what
have

lose

either
in

matter

diamond

get
the
well

free
her

under

I
take

<EOS>
Lizzie
could
only
shrug
her
shoulder

<EOS>
She
herself
,
among
many
doubt
,
be
upon
the
whole
dispose
to
think
as
everybody
think
.
<EOS>
She
do
believe
,
 
as
far
as
she
believe
anything
in
the
matter
,
that
the
Corsair
have
determine
to
become
possess
of
the
prize
from
the
moment
that
he
see
it
in
Scotland
,
that
the
Corsair
arrange
the
robbery
in
Carlisle
,
and
that
again
he
arrange
the
robbery
in
the
London
house
as
soon
as
he
learn
from
Lizzie
where
the
diamond
be
place
.
<EOS>
to
her
mind
this
have
be
the
most
ready
solution
of
the
mystery
,
and
when
she
find
that
other
people
almost
regard
him
as
the
thief
,
her
doubt
become
a
belief
.
<EOS>
and
she
do
not
in
the
least
despise
or
dislike
him
or
condemn
him
for
what
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
be
he
to
come
to
her
and
confess
it
all
,
tell
his
story
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
her
seem
to
be
safe
for
the
future
,
she
would
congratulate
him
and
accept
him
at
once
as
her
own
dear
,
expect
Corsair
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
so
,
he
should
not
have
bungle
the
thing
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
manage
his
subordinate
better
than
to
have
one
of
them
turn
evidence
against
him
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
be
able
to
get
rid
of
a
poor
weak
female
like
Patience
Crabstick
.
<EOS>
why
have
he
not
send
her
to
New
York
,
or
 
or
 
or
anywhere
?
<EOS>
if
Lizzie
be
to
hear
that
Lord
George
have
take
Patience
out
to
sea
in
a
yacht
,
 
somewhere
among
the
bright
island
of
which
she
think
so
much
,
 
and
drop
the
girl
overboard
,
tie
up
in
a
bag
,
she
would
regard
it
as
a
proper
Corsair
arrangement
.
<EOS>
now
she
be
angry
with
Lord
George
because
her
trouble
be
come
back
upon
her

Frank
have
suggest
that
Lord
George
be
the
robber
in
chief

Lizzie
merely
shrug
her
shoulder

that
a
man
well

know
to
the
London
police
as
an
accomplished
housebreaker
have
be
arrest
in
reference
to
the
robbery
which
be
effect
on
the
30th
of
January
last
at
Lady
Eustace

house
in
Hertford

<EOS>
no

the

person

concern
in
the
robbery
of
her
ladyship
's
jewel
at
Carlisle
on
the
night
of
the
8th
of
January

<EOS>
the
mystery
which
have
so
long
envelop
these
two
affair
,
and
which
have
be
so
discreditable
to
the
metropolitan
police
,
will
now
probably
be
clear
up
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
a
word
about
Patience
Crabstick
in
this
;
and
,
as
Lizzie
observe
,
the
news
bring
by
the
policeman
on
Saturday
night
refer
only
to
Patience
,
and
say
nothing
of
the
arrest
of
any
burglar
.
<EOS>
the
lady
in
Hertford
Street
scan
the
sentence
with
the
great
care
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
very
angry
because
the
house
be

It

It
ought
to

Mrs.

the

should
be
more
careful

I
suppose
we
shall
all
have
to
go
before
the
magistrate
again

"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lizzie
feel
that
fresh
trouble
be
certainly
come
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
learn
now
that
the
crime
for
which
she
may
be
prosecute
and
punish
be
that
of
perjury
,
 
that
even
if
everything
be
know
,
she
could
not
be
accuse
of
steal
,
and
that
if
she
could
only
get
out
of
the
way
till
the
wrath
of
the
magistrate
and
policeman
should
have
evaporate
,
she
may
possibly
escape
altogether
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
they
could
not
take
her
income
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
but
how
could
she
get
out
of
the
way
,
and
how
could
she
endure
to
be
cros
-
examine
,
and
look
at
,
and
inquire
into
,
by
all
those
who
would
be
concern
in
the
matter
?
<EOS>
She
think
that
,
if
only
she
could
have
arrange
her
matrimonial
affair
before
the
bad
day
come
upon
her
,
she
could
have
endure
it
better
.
<EOS>
if
she
may
be
allow
to
see
Lord
George
,
she
could
ask
for
advice
,
 
could
ask
for
advice
,
not
as
she
be
always
force
to
do
from
her
cousin
,
on
a
false
statement
of
fact
,
but
with
everything
know
and
declare
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
very
day
Lord
George
come
to
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
there
more
than
once
,
perhaps
half
a
dozen
time
,
since
the
robbery
;
but
on
all
these
occasion
Lizzie
have
be
in
bed
,
and
he
have
decline
to
visit
her
in
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
even
Lord
George
have
become
somewhat
afraid
of
her
since
he
have
be
tell
the
true
story
as
to
the
necklace
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
that
story
he
have
hear
from
herself
,
and
he
have
also
hear
from
Mr.
Benjamin
some
other
little
detail
as
to
her
former
life
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
,
whose
very
close
attention
have
be
draw
to
the
Eustace
diamond
,
have
tell
Lord
George
how
he
have
value
them
at
her
ladyship
's
request
,
and
have
cause
an
iron
case
to
be
make
for
them
,
and
how
her
ladyship
have
,
on
one
occasion
,
endeavour
to
sell
the
necklace
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
,
who
certainly
be
intimate
with
Lord
George
,
be
very
fond
of
talk
about
the
diamond
,
and
have
once
suggest
to
his
lordship
that
,
be
they
to
become
his
lordship
's
by
marriage
,
he
,
Benjamin
,
may
be
willing
to
treat
with
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
in
regard
to
treat
with
her
ladyship
,
 
Mr.
Benjamin
acknowledge
that
he
think
it
would
be
too
hazardous
.
<EOS>
then
come
the
robbery
of
the
box
,
and
Lord
George
be
all
astray
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
be
for
a
while
equally
astray
,
but
neither
friend
believe
in
the
other
friend
's
innocence
.
<EOS>
that
Lord
George
should
suspect
Mr.
Benjamin
be
quite
natural
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
hardly
know
what
to
think
;
 
hardly
give
Lord
George
credit
for
the
necessary
courage
,
skill
,
and
energy
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
,
as
he
begin
to
put
two
and
two
together
,
he
divine
the
truth
,
and
be
enable
to
set
the
docile
Patience
on
the
watch
over
her
mistress
's
belonging
.
<EOS>
so
it
have
be
with
Mr.
Benjamin
,
who
at
last
be
able
to
satisfy
Mr.
Smiler
and
Mr.
Cann
that
he
have
be
no
party
to
their
cruel
disappointment
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
how
Lord
George
have
learn
the
truth
have
be
tell
;
 
the
truth
as
to
Lizzie
's
hide
the
necklace
under
her
pillow
and
bring
it
up
to
London
in
her
desk
.
<EOS>
but
of
the
fact
of
the
second
robbery
he
know
nothing
up
to
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
almost
suspect
that
Lizzie
have
herself
again
be
at
work
,
 
and
he
be
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
promise
her
that
he
would
take
care
of
her
,
 
have
,
perhaps
,
say
enough
to
make
her
believe
that
some
day
he
would
marry
her
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
remember
what
he
have
say
;
 
but
he
be
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
wonderfully
clever
that
,
if
he
do
not
take
care
,
she
would
get
him
into
some
mess
from
which
he
would
be
unable
to
extricate
himself
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
never
whisper
her
secret
to
any
one
;
and
have
still
be
at
a
loss
about
the
second
robbery
,
when
he
too
see
the
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
He
go
direct
to
Scotland
Yard
and
make
inquiry
there
.
<EOS>
His
name
have
be
so
often
use
in
the
affair
,
that
such
inquiry
from
him
be
justified
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
my
lord
;
yes
;
we
have
find
out
something
,
"
say
Bunfit
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
be
off
,
you
know

"
  
<EOS>
"
Benjamin
off
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
cut
the
painter
,
my
lord
,
and
start
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
good
,
now
we
have
the
wire
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
who
be
the
thief
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
my
lord
,
that
be
tell
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
do
.
<EOS>
perhaps
two
or
three
of
us
know
.
<EOS>
You
will
hear
all
in
good
time
,
my
lord
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunfit
wish
to
appear
communicative
because
he
know
but
little
himself
.
<EOS>
Gager
,
in
the
mean
possible
manner
,
have
keep
the
matter
very
close
;
but
the
fact
that
Mr.
Benjamin
have
start
suddenly
on
foreign
travel
have
become
known
to
Mr.
Bunfit
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
have
be
very
careful
,
ask
no
question
about
the
necklace
;
 
no
question
which
would
have
show
that
he
know
that
the
necklace
have
be
in
Hertford
Street
when
the
robbery
take
place
there
;
but
it
seem
to
him
now
that
the
police
must
be
aware
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
the
arrest
have
be
make
because
of
the
robbery
in
Hertford
Street
,
and
because
of
that
arrest
Mr.
Benjamin
have
take
his
departure
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
be
too
big
a
man
to
have
concern
himself
deeply
in
the
small
matter
which
have
then
be
steal
.
  
<EOS>
from
Scotland
Yard
Lord
George
go
direct
to
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
want
of
money
,
in
want
of
a
settle
home
,
in
want
of
a
future
income
,
and
altogether
unsatisfied
with
his
present
mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
,
no
doubt
,
would
take
him
,
 
unless
she
have
tell
her
secret
to
some
other
lover
.
<EOS>
to
have
his
wife
,
immediately
on
her
marriage
,
or
even
before
it
,
arraign
for
perjury
,
would
not
be
pleasant
.
<EOS>
there
be
very
much
in
the
whole
affair
of
which
he
would
not
be
proud
as
he
lead
his
bride
to
the
altar
;
 
but
a
man
do
not
expect
to
get
four
thousand
pound
a
year
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
at
any
rate
,
do
not
conceive
himself
to
be
in
a
position
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
have
there
not
be
something
crooked
about
Lizzie
,
 
a
screw
loose
,
as
people
say
,
 
she
would
never
have
be
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
who
always
ride
lame
horse
,
and
yet
see
as
much
of
the
hunting
as
other
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
when
he
have
begin
to
think
that
,
after
the
tale
which
he
have
force
her
to
tell
him
,
she
have
cause
the
diamond
to
be
steal
by
her
own
maid
out
of
her
own
desk
,
become
almost
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
as
he
look
at
the
matter
again
and
again
,
he
believe
that
the
second
robbery
have
be
genuine
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
quite
make
up
his
mind
,
but
he
go
to
Hertford
Street
resolve
to
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
ask
for
her
,
and
be
show
at
once
into
her
own
sitting
-
room
.
"
<EOS>
so
you
have
come
at
last
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
have
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
do
for
me
to
come
up
to
you
when
you
be
in
bed
.
<EOS>
those
woman
down
-
stair
would
have
talk
about
it
everywhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
would
,
"
say
Lizzie
almost
piteously
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
have
be
at
all
wise
after
all
that
have
be
say
.
<EOS>
People
would
have
be
sure
to
suspect
that
I
have
get
the
thing
out
of
your
desk
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
;
 
not
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
to
run
the
risk
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
manner
to
her
be
anything
but
civil
,
anything
but
complimentary
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
his
Corsair
humour
,
she
be
not
sure
that
a
Corsair
may
be
agreeable
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
tell
me
what
you
know
about
this
second
robbery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
know
nothing
,

you
do

You
know
something

of
course
they
be
take

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
sure
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
in
his
manner
absolutely
insolent
to
her

Frank
be
affectionate

and
even
Lord
Fawn
treat
her
with
deference

<EOS>
because
,
you
know
,
you
have
be
very
clever

<EOS>
to
tell
you
the
truth

I
do
not
think
at
first
that
they
have
be
really
steal

no

people

the

<EOS>
Lizzie
do
not
above
half
understand
him
,
 
do
not
at
all
understand
him
when
he
speak
of
those
who
wear
wig
,
and
be
quite
dark
to
his
irony
about
her
great
friend
;
 
but
she
do
perceive
that
he
be
in
earnest
in
recommend
her
to
confess
.
<EOS>
She
think
about
it
for
a
moment
in
silence

the
more
she

the
more
she
feel
that

<EOS>
have
he
not
suggest
a
second
alternative

that
she

off

<EOS>
It
may
be
possible
that
she
should
go
off
,
and
yet
be
not
quite
like
Mr.

<EOS>
in
that
case
ought
she
not
to
go
under
the
protection
of
her
Corsair

Would
not
that
be
the
proper
way
of
go

may
I
not
go
abroad

just
for
a
time

she
ask

so

it
blow
over

just
so

you

It

not

<EOS>
everybody
would
know

<EOS>
It
be
too
late
now
to
stop
the

if
you
mean

be
off

you
should
be
off
at
once

morrow

"
oh
dear

indeed
,
there
be
no
say
whether
they
will
let
you
go

<EOS>
You
could
start
now
,
this
moment
;
 
and
if
you
be
at
Dover
could
get
over
to
France
.
<EOS>
but
when
once
it
be
know
that
you
have
the
necklace
all
that
time
in
your
own
desk
,
any
magistrate
,
I
imagine
,
could
stop
you
.
<EOS>
You
would
better
have
some
lawyer
you
can
trust
;
 
not
that
blackguard
Mopus

"
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
have
certainly
bring
her
no
comfort
.
<EOS>
when
he
tell
her
that
she
may
go
at
once
if
she
choose
,
she
remember
,
with
a
pang
of
agony
,
that
she
have
already
overdraw
her
account
at
the
banker
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
actual
possessor
of
an
income
of
four
thousand
pound
a
year
,
and
now
,
in
her
terrible
strait
,
she
could
not
stir
because
she
have
no
money
with
which
to
travel
.
<EOS>
have
all
thing
be
well
with
her
,
she
could
,
no
doubt
,
have
go
to
her
banker
and
have
arrange
this
little
difficulty
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
,
she
could
not
move
,
because
her
purse
be
empty
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
sit
look
at
her
,
and
think
whether
he
would
make
the
plunge
and
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
,
 
with
all
her
impediment
and
drawback
about
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
careful
to
reduce
her
to
such
a
condition
of
despair
,
that
she
would
undoubtedly
have
accept
him
,
so
that
she
may
have
some
one
to
lean
upon
in
her
trouble
;
 
but
,
as
he
look
at
her
,
he
doubt
.
<EOS>
She
be
such
a
mass
of
deceit
,
that
he
be
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
may
say
that
she
would
marry
him
,
and
then
,
when
the
storm
be
over
,
refuse
to
keep
her
word
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
in
debt
,
 
almost
to
any
amount
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
already
marry
,
for
anything
that
he
know
.
<EOS>
He
do
know
that
she
be
subject
to
all
manner
of
penalty
for
what
she
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
her
,
and
tell
himself
that
she
be
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
but
in
spite
of
her
beauty
,
his
judgment
go
against
her
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
dare
to
share
even
his
boat
with
so
dangerous
a
fellow
-
passenger
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
advice
,
"
he
say
,
get
up
from
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
yes
;
I
do
not
know
what
else
I
can
do
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
so
unkind
!
"
<EOS>
He
shrug
his
shoulder
,
just
touch
her
hand
,
and
leave
the
room
without
say
another
word
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
last
scheme
 
Lizzie
,
when
she
be
leave
alone
,
be
very
angry
with
the
Corsair
,
 
in
truth
,
more
sincerely
angry
than
she
have
ever
be
with
any
of
her
lover
,
or
,
perhaps
,
with
any
human
being
.
<EOS>
sincere
,
true
,
burn
wrath
be
not
the
fault
to
which
she
be
most
expose
.
<EOS>
She
could
snap
and
snarl
,
and
hate
,
and
say
severe
thing
;
she
could
quarrel
,
and
fight
,
and
be
malicious
;
 
but
to
be
full
of
real
wrath
be
uncommon
with
her
.
<EOS>
now
she
be
angry
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
civil
,
more
than
civil
,
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
She
have
open
her
house
to
him
,
and
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
him
her
great
secret
.
<EOS>
She
have
implore
his
protection
.
<EOS>
She
have
throw
herself
into
his
arm
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
have
reject
her
.
<EOS>
that
he
should
have
be
rough
to
her
<EOS>
be
only
in
accordance
with
the
poetical
attribute
which
she
have
attribute
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
his
roughness
should
have
be
streak
with
tenderness
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
have
leave
her
roughly
.
<EOS>
in
the
whole
interview
he
have
not
say
a
love
word
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
give
her
advice
,
 
which
may
be
good
or
bad
,
 
but
he
have
give
it
as
to
one
whom
he
despise
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
to
her
throughout
the
interview
exactly
as
he
may
have
speak
to
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
analyse
her
feeling
thoroughly
,
but
she
feel
that
because
of
what
have
pass
between
them
,
by
reason
of
his
knowledge
of
her
secret
,
he
have
rob
her
of
all
that
observance
which
be
due
to
her
as
a
woman
and
a
lady
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
roughly
use
before
,
 
by
people
of
inferior
rank
who
have
see
through
her
way
.
<EOS>
Andrew
Gowran
have
insult
her
.
<EOS>
Patience
Crabstick
have
argue
with
her
.
<EOS>
Benjamin
,
the
employer
of
thief
,
have
be
familiar
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
hitherto
,
in
what
she
be
pleased
to
call
her
own
set
,
she
have
always
be
treat
with
that
courtesy
which
lady
seldom
fail
to
receive
.
<EOS>
She
understand
it
all
.
<EOS>
She
know
how
much
of
mere
word
-
service
there
often
be
in
such
complimentary
usage
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
it
imply
respect
,
and
an
acknowledgement
of
the
position
of
her
who
be
so
respected
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
have
treat
her
as
one
schoolboy
treat
another
.
  
<EOS>
and
he
have
not
speak
to
her
one
word
of
love
.
<EOS>
love
will
excuse
roughness
.
<EOS>
spoken
love
will
palliate
even
speak
roughness
.
<EOS>
have
he
once
call
her
his
own
Lizzie
,
he
may
have
scold
her
as
he
please
,
 
may
have
abuse
her
to
the
top
of
his
bent
.
<EOS>
but
as
there
have
be
nothing
of
the
manner
of
a
gentleman
to
a
lady
,
so
also
have
there
be
nothing
of
the
lover
to
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
that
dream
be
over
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
be
no
longer
a
Corsair
,
but
a
brute
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
should
she
do
?
<EOS>
even
a
brute
may
speak
truth
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
have
go
to
a
theatre
that
evening
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
but
she
stay
at
home
think
over
her
position
.
<EOS>
She
hear
nothing
throughout
the
day
from
the
police
;
and
she
make
up
her
mind
that
,
unless
she
be
stop
by
the
police
,
she
would
go
to
Scotland
on
the
day
but
one
following
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
she
be
sure
that
she
would
do
so
;
but
,
of
course
,
she
must
be
guide
by
event
as
they
occur
.
<EOS>
She
write
,
however
,
to
Miss
Macnulty
say
that
she
would
come
,
and
she
tell
Mrs.
Carbuncle
of
her
propose
journey
as
that
lady
be
leave
the
house
for
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
on
the
following
morning
,
however
,
news
come
which
again
make
her
journey
doubtful
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
about
the
robbery
,
acknowledge
the
former
paragraph
to
have
be
in
some
respect
erroneous
.
<EOS>
the
"
accomplished
housebreaker
"
have
not
be
arrest
.
<EOS>
a
confederate
of
the
"
accomplished
housebreaker
"
be
in
the
hand
of
the
police
,
and
the
police
be
on
the
track
of
the
"
accomplished
housebreaker
"
himself
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
line
or
two
allude
in
a
very
mysterious
way
to
the
disappearance
of
a
certain
jeweller
.
<EOS>
take
it
altogether
,
Lizzie
think
that
there
be
ground
for
hope
,
 
and
that
,
at
any
rate
,
there
would
be
delay
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
perhaps
,
put
off
go
to
Scotland
for
yet
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
necessary
that
she
should
wait
for
Lord
Fawn
's
answer
;
and
would
it
not
be
incumbent
on
her
cousin
Frank
to
send
her
some
account
of
himself
after
the
abrupt
manner
in
which
he
have
leave
her
?
  
<EOS>
if
in
real
truth
she
should
be
drive
to
tell
her
story
to
any
one
,
 
and
she
begin
to
think
that
she
be
so
drive
,
 
she
would
tell
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
believe
more
in
his
regard
for
her
than
that
of
any
other
human
being
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
he
would
,
in
truth
,
have
be
devote
to
her
,
have
he
not
become
entangle
with
that
wretched
little
governess
.
<EOS>
and
she
think
that
if
he
could
see
his
way
out
of
that
scrape
,
he
would
marry
her
even
yet
,
 
would
marry
her
,
and
be
good
to
her
,
so
that
her
dream
of
a
poetical
phase
of
life
should
not
be
altogether
dissolve
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
the
diamond
be
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
steal
them
.
<EOS>
when
perplex
in
the
extreme
by
magistrate
and
policeman
,
with
nobody
near
her
whom
she
trust
to
give
her
advice
,
 
for
Lizzie
now
of
course
declare
to
herself
that
she
have
never
for
a
moment
trust
the
Corsair
,
 
she
have
fall
into
an
error
,
and
say
what
be
not
true
.
<EOS>
as
she
practise
it
before
the
glass
,
she
think
that
she
could
tell
her
story
in
a
become
manner
,
with
become
tear
,
to
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
and
be
it
not
for
Lucy
Morris
,
she
think
that
he
would
take
her
with
all
her
fault
and
all
her
burthen
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Lord
Fawn
,
she
know
well
enough
that
,
let
him
write
what
he
would
,
and
renew
his
engagement
in
what
most
formal
manner
may
be
possible
,
he
would
be
off
again
when
he
learn
the
fact
as
to
that
night
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
She
have
bring
him
to
succumb
,
because
he
could
no
longer
justify
his
treatment
of
her
by
reference
to
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
but
when
once
all
the
world
should
know
that
she
have
twice
perjure
herself
,
his
justification
would
be
complete
,
 
and
his
escape
would
be
certain
.
<EOS>
She
would
use
his
letter
simply
to
achieve
that
revenge
which
she
have
promise
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
effort
,
 
her
last
final
effort
,
 
must
be
make
to
secure
the
hand
and
heart
of
her
cousin
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
ah
,
"
tis
his
heart
<EOS>
I
want
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
must
settle
something
before
she
go
to
Scotland
,
 
if
there
be
anything
that
could
be
settle
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
only
get
a
promise
from
Frank
before
all
her
treachery
have
be
expose
,
he
probably
would
remain
true
to
his
promise
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
desert
her
as
Lord
Fawn
have
do
.
<EOS>
then
,
after
much
thinking
of
it
,
she
resolve
upon
a
scheme
which
,
of
all
her
scheme
,
be
the
wicked
.
<EOS>
whatever
it
may
cost
her
,
she
would
create
a
separation
between
Frank
Greystock
and
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
have
determine
upon
this
,
she
write
to
Lucy
,
ask
her
to
call
in
Hertford
Street
at
a
certain
hour
.
  
<EOS>
dear
LUCY
,
  
<EOS>
I
particularly
want
to
see
you
,
 
on
business
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
Your

LIZZIE

<EOS>
as
a
matter
of
course
Lucy
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
before
the
interview
,
study
the
part
she
be
to
play
with
all
possible
care
,
 
even
to
the
word
which
she
be
to
use
.
<EOS>
the
greeting
be
at
first
kindly
,
for
Lucy
have
almost
forget
the
bribe
that
have
be
offer
to
her
,
and
have
quite
forgive
it
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
never
could
be
dear
to
her
;
but
,
 
<EOS>
so
Lucy
have
think
during
her
happiness
,
 
this
former
friend
of
her
be
the
cousin
of
the
man
who
be
to
be
her
husband
,
and
be
dear
to
him
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
have
forgive
the
offence
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
dear
,
I
want
to
ask
you
a
question
,
"
Lizzie
say
;
"
or
rather
,
perhaps
not
a
question
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
it
better
than
that
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
my
cousin
Frank
once
talk
of
 
of
make
you
his
wife
.
"
<EOS>
Lucy
answer
not
a
word
,
but
she
tremble
in
every
limb
,
and
the
colour
come
to
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
it
not
so
,
dear

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
if
it
be
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
you
should
ask
me
any
question
like
that
about
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
not
my
cousin
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
 
he
be
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
ask
him
?
<EOS>
You
see
him
every
day
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
nearly
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
send
for
me
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
hard
to
tell
you
,
Lucy
.
<EOS>
I
have
send
to
you
in
good
faith
,
and
in
love
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
go
to
you
,
 
only
for
the
old
vulture
,
who
would
not
have
let
us
have
a
word
in
peace
.
<EOS>
I
do
see
him
 
constantly
.
<EOS>
and
I
love
him
dearly

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
nothing
to
me
,
"
say
Lucy
.
<EOS>
anybody
hear
them
,
and
not
know
them
,
would
have
say
that
Lucy
's
manner
be
harsh
in
the
extreme
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
tell
me
everything
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
say
this
,
pause
,
look
at
her
victim
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
tell
me
thing
which
he
could
not
mention
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
yesterday
,
 
the
day
before
yesterday
,
 
that
he
be
speak
to
me
of
his
debt
.
<EOS>
I
offer
to
place
all
that
I
have
at
his
disposal
,
so
as
to
free
him
,
but
he
would
not
take
my
money

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
would
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not

money

<EOS>
then
he
tell
me
that

<EOS>
He

never

yet
I

out

I

Lucy

You
can
not

nonsense

he

none

if
I

should
I

give
him
all
that
I

not

no

and
of

be
you
do
the
good
for
him

a
man
in
his
position

without

ambitious

sure

not

him

I

I
love

so
truly

"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
that
do
him
any
service
?
<EOS>
He
can
not
marry
you

<EOS>
do
he
ever
see
you

<EOS>
do
he
write
to
you
as

do
you
not

<EOS>
that
it
must
be
over
?
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
he
should
marry
you

<EOS>
but
if
you
will
give
him
back
his
word
,
he
shall
be
my
husband

shall
have
all
that
I
possess

us
see
who
love

how
will
you
show

there
be
no

He
know
it

the
only
one
in
the
world
to
whom
I
wish
it
to
be
know

know
it
already
well
enough

do
you
send
for
me
for
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
for
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
for
him
to
tell
me
the
tiding
;
 
not
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
be
nothing
to
me
;
 
nothing
.
<EOS>
and
what
you
say
to
me
now
be
all
for
yourself
,
 
not
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
true
that
he
do
not
see
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
do
not
write
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
him
from
me

for
I
can
not
write
to
him
myself

that
he
may
do
whatever
be
good
for
him

but
if
you
tell
him
that
I
do
not
love
him
better
than
all
the
world
,
you
will
lie
to
him

if
you
say
that
he
love
you
better

do
me

that
also
will
be

lie

Lucy
 
"
  
"
I
will
hear
no
more

<EOS>
He
can
do
as
he
please

if
money
be
more
to
him
than
love
and
honesty
,
let
him
marry
you

I
shall
never
trouble
him

he
may
be
sure

that

for
you

I
hope
that
we
may
never
meet
again

<EOS>
She
would
not
get
into
the
Eustace

Carbuncle
carriage
,
which
be
wait
for
her
at
the
door
,
but
walk
back
to
Bruton
Street

<EOS>
She
do
not
doubt

that
it
be
all
over
with
her
now
.
<EOS>
that
Lizzie
Eustace
be
an
inveterate
liar

she

It

<EOS>
Tribute
 
<EOS>
Lizzie
put
off
her
journey
to
Scotland
from
day
to
day
,
though
her
cousin
Frank
continually
urge
upon
her
the
expediency
of
go
.
<EOS>
there
be
various
reason
,
he
say
,
why
she
should
go
.
<EOS>
Her
child
be
there
,
and
it
be
proper
that
she
should
be
with
her
child
.
<EOS>
She
be
live
at
present
with
people
whose
reputation
do
not
stand
high
,
 
and
as
to
whom
all
manner
of
evil
report
be
fly
about
the
town
.
<EOS>
It
be
generally
think
,
 
so
say
Frank
,
 
that
that
Lord
George
de
Bruce
Carruthers
have
assist
Mr.
Benjamin
in
steal
the
diamond
,
and
Frank
himself
do
not
hesitate
to
express
his
belief
in
the
accusation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
no
,
that
can
not
be
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
tremble
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
she
reject
the
supposition
,
she
do
not
reject
it
very
firmly
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
you
know
,
"
continue
Lizzie
,
"
I
never
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
actually
only
set
eye
on
him
once
since
the
second
robbery
,
and
then
just
for
a
minute
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
use
to
know
him
,
 
down
at
Portray
,
 
<EOS>
but
now
we
be
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
Frank
go
on
with
his
objection
.
<EOS>
He
declare
that
the
manner
in
which
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
get
up
the
match
between
Lucinda
Roanoke
and
Sir
Griffin
be
shameful
,
 
all
the
world
be
declare
that
it
be
shameful
,
 
that
she
have
not
a
penny
,
that
the
girl
be
an
adventurer
,
and
that
Sir
Griffin
be
an
obstinate
,
pig
-
head
,
ruin
idiot
.
<EOS>
It
be
expedient
on
every
account
that
Lizzie
should
take
herself
away
from
that
"
lot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
answer
that
Lizzie
desire
to
make
be
very
simple
.
<EOS>
let
me
go
as
your
betroth
bride
,
and
I
will
start
to
-
morrow
,
 
to
Scotland
or
elsewhere
,
as
you
may
direct
.
<EOS>
let
that
little
affair
be
settle
,
and
I
shall
be
quite
as
willing
to
get
out
of
London
as
you
can
be
to
send
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
in
such
a
peck
of
trouble
that
something
must
be
settle
.
<EOS>
and
as
it
seem
that
after
all
the
police
be
still
astray
about
the
necklace
,
perhaps
I
need
not
run
away
from
them
for
a
little
while
even
yet
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
say
this
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
even
in
<EOS>
so
many
word
make
the
first
proposition
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
endeavour
to
make
Frank
understand
that
she
would
obey
his
dictation
if
he
would
earn
the
right
to
dictate
.
<EOS>
He
either
do
not
or
would
not
understand
her
,
and
then
she
become
angry
with
him
,
 
or
pretend
to
be
angry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
really
,
Frank
,
"
she
say
,
"
you
be
hardly
fair
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
what
way
be
I
unfair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
come
here
and
abuse
all
my
friend
,
and
tell
me
to
go
here
and
go
there
,
just
as
though
I
be
a
child
.
<EOS>
and
 
and
 
and
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
what
,
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
You
be
one
thing
one
day
,
and
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
hope
Miss
Lucy
Morris
be
quite

last
hear
from

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
right
to
speak
to
me
of
Lucy

at
least
,
not
in
disparagement
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
treat
her
very
badly
;
 
you
know
that

then

you
give
it
up
?
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
let
her
have
her
chance
,
 
to
do
what
she
can
with
them
?
<EOS>
You
know
very
well
that
you
can
not
marry
her

<EOS>
You
know
that
you
ought
not
to
have
ask
her
.
<EOS>
You
talk
of
Miss
Roanoke
and
Sir
Griffin
Tewett

<EOS>
there
be
people
quite
as
bad
as
Sir
Griffin

Mrs.
Carbuncle
either

<EOS>
do
not
suppose
I
be
speak
for
myself

<EOS>
I
have
give
up
all
that
idle
fancy
long
ago

<EOS>
I
shall
never
marry
a
second
time
myself

<EOS>
I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
that

I
have
suffer
too
much
already

"
then
she
burst
into
tear
.
  
<EOS>
He
dry
her
tear
and
comfort
her
,
and
forgave
all
the
injurious
thing
she
have
say
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
impossible
for
a
man
,
 
a
man
under
forty
and
unmarried
,
and
who
be
not
a
philosopher
,
 
to
have
familiar
and
affectionate
intercourse
with
a
beautiful
young
woman
,
and
carry
it
on
as
he
may
do
with
a
friend
of
the
other
sex
.
<EOS>
in
his
very
heart
Greystock
despise
this
woman
;
he
have
tell
himself
over
and
over
again
that
be
there
no
Lucy
in
the
case
he
would
not
marry
her
;
that
she
be
affect
,
unreal
,
 
and
,
in
fact
,
a
liar
in
every
word
and
look
and
motion
which
come
from
her
with
premeditation
.
<EOS>
judging
,
not
from
her
own
account
,
but
from
circumstance
as
he
see
them
and
such
evidence
as
have
reach
him
,
he
do
not
condemn
her
in
reference
to
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
for
a
moment
conceive
that
she
have
secrete
them
.
<EOS>
He
acquit
her
altogether
from
those
special
charge
which
have
be
widely
circulate
against
her
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
know
her
to
be
heartless
and
bad
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
himself
a
dozen
time
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
that
she
should
be
marry
and
take
out
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
love
her
after
a
fashion
,
and
be
prone
to
sit
near
her
,
and
be
fool
enough
to
be
flatter
by
her
caress
.
<EOS>
when
she
would
lay
her
hand
on
his
arm

a
thrill
of
pleasure
go
through
him

<EOS>
and
yet
he
would
willingly
have
see
any
decent
man
take
her
and
marry
her
,
make
a
bargain
that
he
should
never
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
young

old

man
be
apt
to
become
Merlins
when
they
encounter
Viviens
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
he
leave
her

disgusted
indeed
,
but
not

that
he
be
disgust

<EOS>
"
come
again

to

not
you

<EOS>
she

.
<EOS>
He
make
her
no
promise
as
he
go
,
nor
have
she
expect
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
leave
her
quite
abruptly
the
other
day
,
and
he
now
go
away
almost
in
the
same
fashion
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
surprised
.
<EOS>
She
understand
that
the
task
she
have
in
hand
be
one
very
difficult
to
be
accomplish
,
 
and
she
do
perceive
,
in
some
dark
way
,
that
,
good
as
her
acting
be
,
it
be
not
quite
good
enough
.
<EOS>
Lucy
hold
her
ground
because
she
be
real
.
<EOS>
You
may
knock
about
a
diamond
,
and
not
even
scratch
it
;
whereas
paste
in
rough
usage
betray
itself
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
with
all
her
self
-
assure
protestation
,
know
that
she
be
paste
,
and
know
that
Lucy
be
real
stone
.
<EOS>
why
could
she
not
force
herself
to
act
a
little
well
,
so
that
the
paste
may
be
as
good
as
the
stone
,
 
may
at
least
seem
to
be
as
good
?
<EOS>
"
if
he
despise
me
now
,
what
will
he
say
when
he
find
it
all
out
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
herself
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Frank
Greystock
himself
,
though
he
have
quite
make
up
his
mind
about
Lizzie
Eustace
,
he
be
still
in
doubt
about
the
other
girl
.
<EOS>
at
the
present
moment
he
be
make
over
two
thousand
pound
a
year
,
and
yet
be
more
in
debt
now
than
he
have
be
a
year
ago
.
<EOS>
when
he
attempt
to
look
at
his
affair
,
he
could
not
even
remember
what
have
become
of
his
money
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
gamble
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
little
yacht
,
cost
him
about
six
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
keep
one
horse
in
London
,
and
one
only
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
house
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
could
spare
time
from
his
work
,
he
be
generally
entertain
at
the
house
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
and
yet
from
day
to
day
his
condition
seem
to
become
bad
and
bad
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
never
think
of
half
-
a
-
sovereign
;
that
in
call
for
wine
at
his
club
he
be
never
influence
by
the
cost
;
that
it
seem
to
him
quite
rational
to
keep
a
cab
wait
for
him
half
the
day
;
that
in
go
or
come
he
never
calculate
expense
;
<EOS>
that
in
give
an
order
to
a
tailor
he
never
dream
of
anything
beyond
his
own
comfort
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
when
he
recount
with
pride
his
great
economy
,
remind
himself
that
he
,
a
successful
man
,
with
a
large
income
and
no
family
,
keep
neither
hunter
,
nor
yacht
,
nor
moor
,
and
that
he
do
not
gamble
,
he
do
think
it
very
hard
that
he
should
be
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
embarrassed
,
and
in
that
condition
could
it
be
right
for
him
to
marry
a
girl
without
a
shilling
?
  
<EOS>
in
these
day
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
very
urgent
with
her
friend
not
to
leave
London
till
after
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
give
no
promise
,
 
have
only
be
induce
to
promise
that
the
loan
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
should
not
be
hold
to
have
any
bearing
on
the
wedding
present
to
be
make
to
Lucinda
.
<EOS>
that
could
be
get
on
credit
from
Messrs.
Harter
and
Benjamin
;
for
though
Mr.
Benjamin
be
absent
,
 
on
a
little
tour
through
Europe
in
search
of
precious
stone
in
the
cheap
market
,
old
Mr.
Harter
suggest
,
 
the
business
go
on
the
same
as
ever
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
deal
of
consultation
about
the
present
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
at
last
decide
,
no
doubt
with
the
concurrence
of
Miss
Roanoke
,
that
it
should
consist
simply
of
silver
fork
and
spoon
,
 
real
silver
as
far
as
the
money
would
go
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
herself
go
with
her
friend
to
select
the
article
,
 
as
to
which
,
perhaps
,
we
shall
do
her
no
injustice
in
say
that
a
ready
sale
,
should
such
a
lamentable
occurrence
ever
become
necessary
,
be
one
of
the
object
which
she
have
in
view
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
investigation
as
to
the
quality
of
the
metal
quite
win
Mr.
Harter
's
respect
;
and
it
will
probably
be
think
that
she
exact
no
more
than
justice
,
 
see
that
the
thing
have
become
a
matter
of
bargain
,
 
in
demand
that
the
thirty
-
five
pound
should
be
stretch
to
fifty
,
because
the
thing
be
buy
on
long
credit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Lizzie
,
"
Mrs.
Carbuncle
say
,
"
the
dear
girl
will
not
have
an
ounce
more
than
she
would
have
get
,
have
you
go
into
another
sort
of
shop
with
thirty
-
five
sovereign
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
growl
,
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
final
argument
be
conclusive
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
we
will
do
,
"
say
she
;
"
we
will
take
thirty
pound
down
in
ready
money
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
answer
to
be
make
to
so
reasonable
a
proposition
.
  
<EOS>
the
present
to
be
make
to
Lucinda
be
very
much
thought
of
in
Hertford
Street
at
this
time
,
and
Lizzie
,
 
independently
of
any
feeling
that
she
may
have
as
to
her
own
contribution
,
 
do
all
she
could
to
assist
the
collection
of
tribute
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
understand
that
as
a
girl
can
only
be
marry
once
,
 
for
a
widow
's
chance
in
such
matter
<EOS>
amount
to
but
little
,
 
everything
should
be
do
to
gather
toll
from
the
tax
-
payer
of
society
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
fair
on
such
an
occasion
that
man
should
be
give
to
understand
that
something
worth
have
be
expect
,
 
no
trumpery
thirty
-
shill
piece
of
crockery
,
no
insignificant
glass
bottle
,
or
fantastic
paper
-
knife
of
no
real
value
whatever
,
but
get
up
just
to
put
money
into
the
tradesman
's
hand
.
<EOS>
to
one
or
two
elderly
gentleman
upon
whom
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
smile
,
she
venture
to
suggest
in
plain
word
that
a
cheque
be
the
most
convenient
cadeau
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
to
a
couple
of
sovereign
?
"
<EOS>
one
sarcastic
old
gentleman
reply
,
upon
whom
probably
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
not
smile
enough
.
<EOS>
She
laugh
and
congratulate
her
sarcastic
friend
upon
his
joke
;
 
but
the
two
sovereign
be
leave
upon
the
table
,
and
go
to
swell
the
spoil
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
do
something
handsome
for
Lucinda
,
"
Lizzie
say
to
her
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
call
handsome
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
bachelor
and
a
Member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
say
fifteen
pound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
 
---
if
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
say
Frank
,
who
be
begin
to
be
very
much
disgust
with
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
five
-
pound
note
,
and
you
may
do
what
you
please
with
it
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
give
over
the
five
-
pound
note
,
 
the
identical
bit
of
paper
that
have
come
from
Frank
;
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
no
doubt
,
do
do
what
she
please
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
almost
a
quarrel
because
Lizzie
,
after
much
consideration
,
declare
that
she
do
not
see
her
way
to
get
a
present
from
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
She
have
talk
so
much
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
about
the
duke
,
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
almost
justified
in
make
the
demand
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
the
value
,
you
know
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;
"
neither
I
nor
Lucinda
would
think
of
that
;
but
it
would
look
so
well
to
have
the
dear
duke
's
name
on
something
.
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
declare
that
the
duke
be
unapproachable
on
such
subject
.
<EOS>
"
there
you
be
wrong
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
I
happen
to
know
there
be
nothing
his
grace
like
so
much
as
give
wedding
present
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
hard
upon
Lizzie
as
she
actually
do
succeed
in
say
such
kind
thing
about
Lucinda
,
that
Lady
Glencora
send
Miss
Roanoke
the
pretty
smelling
-
bottle
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
to
say
you
have
give
a
present
to
the
future
Lady
Tewett
?
"
say
Madame
Max
Goesler
to
her
friend
.
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
can
not
hurt
me
.
<EOS>
when
one
begin
to
be
good
-
natured
,
why
should
not
one
be
good
-
natured
all
round
?
"
<EOS>
Madame
Max
remark
that
it
may
,
perhaps
,
be
preferable
to
put
an
end
to
good
-
nature
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
there
I
daresay
you
be
right
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
long
feel
that
make
present
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
only
if
one
have
a
lot
of
money
and
people
like
it
,
why
should
not
one
?
<EOS>
I
have
make
so
many
to
people
<EOS>
I
hardly
ever
see
that
one
more
to
Lady
Tewett
can
not
hurt
.
"
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
most
wonderful
affair
in
that
campaign
be
the
spirited
attack
which
Mrs.
Carbuncle
make
on
a
certain
Mrs.
Hanbury
Smith
,
who
for
the
last
six
or
seven
year
have
not
be
among
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
more
intimate
friend
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hanbury
Smith
live
with
her
husband
in
Paris
,
but
before
her
marriage
have
know
Mrs.
Carbuncle
in
London
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
Mr.
Bunbury
Jones
,
have
,
from
certain
cause
,
choose
to
show
certain
civility
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
just
at
the
period
of
his
daughter
's
marriage
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
perhaps
at
that
moment
well
supply
with
ready
money
,
have
present
a
marriage
present
.
<EOS>
from
that
to
this
present
day
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
see
nothing
of
Mrs.
Hanbury
Smith
,
nor
of
Mr.
Bunbury
Jones
,
but
she
be
not
the
woman
to
waste
the
return
-
value
of
such
a
transaction
.
<EOS>
a
present
so
give
be
<EOS>
seed
sow
in
the
earth
,
 
seed
,
indeed
,
<EOS>
that
could
not
be
expect
to
give
back
twenty
-
fold
,
or
even
ten
-
fold
,
but
still
seed
from
which
a
crop
should
be
expect
.
<EOS>
so
she
write
to
Mrs.
Hanbury
Smith
,
explain
that
her
darle
niece
Lucinda
be
about
to
be
married
to
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
and
that
,
as
she
have
no
child
of
her
own
,
Lucinda
be
the
same
to
her
as
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
lest
there
may
be
any
want
of
comprehension
,
she
express
her
own
assurance
that
her
friend
would
be
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
reciprocate
the
feeling
which
have
be
evince
on
the
occasion
of
her
own
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
good
mincing
matter
now
-
a
-
day
,
"
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
have
say
,
have
any
friend
point
out
to
her
that
she
be
take
strong
measure
in
the
exaction
of
toll
.
<EOS>
"
People
have
come
to
understand
that
a
spade
be
a
spade
,
and
£
10
,
£
10
,
"
she
would
have
say
.
<EOS>
have
Mrs.
Hanbury
Smith
not
notice
the
application
,
there
may
,
perhaps
,
have
be
an
end
of
it
,
but
she
be
silly
enough
to
send
over
from
Paris
a
little
trumpery
bit
of
finery
,
buy
in
the
Palais

if

Yours

CAROLINE
HANBURY

<EOS>
the
correspondence
be
carry
no
further
,
for
not
even
can
a
Mrs.
Carbuncle
exact
payment
of
such
a
debt
in
any
establish
court
;
but
she
inveigh
bitterly
against
the
meanness
of
Mrs.
Smith
,
tell
the
story
openly
,
and
never
feel
that
she
tell
it
against
herself
.
<EOS>
in
her
set
it
be
generally
think
that
she
have
do
quite
right
.
  
<EOS>
She
manage
better
with
old
Mr.
Cabob
,
who
have
certainly
receive
many
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
smile
,
and
who
be
very
rich
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cabob
do
as
he
be
desire
,
and
send
a
cheque
,
 
a
cheque
for
£
20
;
and
add
a
message
that
he
hope
Miss
Roanoke
would
buy
with
it
any
little
thing
that
she
like
.
<EOS>
Miss
Roanoke
,
 
or
her
aunt
for
her
,
 
like
a
thirty
-
guinea
ring
,
and
buy
it
,
have
the
bill
for
the
balance
send
in
to
Mr.
Cabob
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cabob
,
who
probably
know
that
he
must
pay
well
for
his
smile
,
never
say
anything
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
go
into
all
this
work
,
absolutely
like
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
feel
nothing
of
anger
even
as
regard
her
own
contribution
,
 
much
as
she
have
struggle
to
reduce
the
amount
.
<EOS>
People
,
she
feel
,
ought
to
be
sharp
;
 
and
it
be
nice
to
look
at
pretty
thing
,
and
to
be
cunne
about
them
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
apply
to
the
Duke
of
Omnium
have
she
dare
,
and
be
very
triumphant
when
she
get
the
smelling

bottle
from
Lady
Glencora

<EOS>
but
Lucinda
herself
take
no
part
<EOS>
whatever
in
all
these
thing
.
<EOS>
nothing
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
could
say
would
induce
her
to
take
any
interest
in
them
,
or
even
in
the
trousseau
,
which
,
without
reference
to
expense
,
be
be
supply
chiefly
on
the
very
indifferent
credit
of
Sir
Griffin

<EOS>
what
Lucinda
have
to
say
about
the
matter
be
say
solely
to
her
aunt

neither
Lady

even
the

complain

with
terrible
energy

what

Aunt

even
Lord
Fawn
have
be
put
under

have
send
a
little
box
full

They

Lucinda

when

give
me
a
gridiron

my

it

"
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
have
be
say
so
often
that
Aunt
Jane
think
nothing
of
the
threat

<EOS>
the
Aspirations
of
Mr.
Emilius
 
<EOS>
It
be
acknowledge
by
Mrs.
Carbuncle
very
freely
that
in
the
matter
of
tribute
no
one
behave
better
than
Mr.
Emilius
,
the
fashionable
,
foreign
,
ci
-
devant
Jew
preacher
,
who
still
draw
great
congregation
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
no
doubt
,
attend
regularly
at
Mr.
Emilius
's
church
,
and
have
take
a
sitting
for
thirteen
sunday
at
something
like
ten
shilling
a
Sunday
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
not
as
yet
pay
the
money
,
and
Mr.
Emilius
be
well
aware
that
if
his
ticket
be
not
pay
for
in
advance
,
there
would
be
considerable
defalcation
in
his
income
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
as
a
rule
,
very
particular
as
to
such
payment
,
and
would
not
allow
a
name
to
be
put
on
a
sitting
till
the
money
have
reach
his
pocket
;
but
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
he
have
descend
to
no
such
commercial
accuracy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
seat
for
three
,
 
for
one
of
which
Lady
Eustace
pay
her
share
in
advance
,
 
in
the
midst
of
the
very
good
pew
in
the
most
conspicuous
part
of
the
house
,
 
and
hardly
a
word
have
be
say
to
her
about
the
money
.
<EOS>
and
now
there
come
to
them
from
Mr.
Emilius
the
pretty
little
gold
salver
that
ever
be
see
.
<EOS>
"
I
send
Messrs.
Clerico
's
docket
,

write
Mr.

as
Miss
Roanoke
may
like
to
know
the
quality
of
the
metal

"
<EOS>
"
ah
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
inspect
the
little
dish
,
and
put
two
and
two
together

"
he

no
doubt
,
 
at
the
place
where
they

him
to
buy
the

and
candlestick
for
the
church

but
at
£
3
16s

<EOS>
3d

<EOS>
the
gold

worth
nearly
twenty
pound

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
no
doubt
have
have
his
outing
in
the
autumn
through
the
instrumentality
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
kindness
;
but
that
be
past
and
go
,
and
such
lavish
gratitude
for
a
past
favour
could
hardly
be
expect
from
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
hang
if
he
be
not
after
Portray
Castle
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
be
after
Portray
Castle
,
and
have
be
after
Portray
Castle
in
a
silent
,
not
very
confident
,
but
yet
not
altogether
hopeless
manner
ever
since
he
have
see
the
glory
of
that
place
,
and
learn
something
of
truth
as
to
the
widow
's
income
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
lead
to
her
conclusion
not
simply
by
the
wedding
present
,
but
in
part
also
by
the
diligence
display
by
Mr.
Emilius
in
remove
the
doubt
which
have
get
abroad
respect
his
condition
in
life
.
<EOS>
He
assure
Mrs.
Carbuncle
that
he
have
never
be
marry
.
<EOS>
shortly
after
his
ordination
,
which
have
be
effect
under
the
hand
of
that
great
and
good
man
the
late
Bishop
of
Jerusalem
,
he
have
take
to
live
with
him
a
lady
who
be
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
do
not
quite
recollect
who
the
lady
be
,
but
remember
that
she
be
connect
in
some
way
with
a
step
-
mother
of
Mr.
Emilius
who
live
in
Bohemia
.
<EOS>
this
lady
have
for
awhile
keep
house
for
Mr.
Emilius
;
 
but
ill
-
natured
thing
have
be
say
,
and
Mr.
Emilius
,
have
respect
to
his
cloth
,
have
send
the
poor
lady
back
to
Bohemia
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
that
he
now
live
in
a
solitude
which
be
absolute
,
and
,
as
Mr.
Emilius
add
,
somewhat
melancholy
.
<EOS>
all
this
Mr.
Emilius
explain
very
fully
,
not
to
Lizzie
herself
,
but
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
if
Lady
Eustace
choose
to
entertain
such
a
suitor
,
why
should
he
not
come
?
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
laugh
when
she
be
tell
that
she
may
add
the
reverend
gentleman
to
the
list
of
her
admirer
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
remember
,
"
she
say
,
"
how
we
use
to
chaff
Miss
Macnulty
about
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
better
than
that
,
"
reply
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
say
what
a
man
may
be
after
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
but
<EOS>
what
he
may
have
think
that
Macnulty
's
connexion
would
increase
his
congregation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
after
you
,
my
dear
,
and
your
income
.
<EOS>
He
can
manage
a
congregation
for
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
very
civil
to
him
,
but
it
would
be
unjust
to
her
to
say
that
she
give
him
any
encouragement
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
the
proper
thing
for
a
lady
to
be
on
intimate
,
and
even
on
affectionate
,
term
with
her
favourite
clergyman
,
and
Lizzie
certainly
have
intercourse
with
no
clergyman
who
be
a
great
favourite
with
her
than
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
dean
for
an
uncle
,
and
a
bishop
for
an
uncle
-
in
-
law
;
but
she
be
at
no
pain
to
hide
her
contempt
for
these
old
fogy
of
the
Church
.
<EOS>
"
They
preach
now
and
then
in
the
cathedral
,
"
she
say
to
Mr.
Emilius
,
"
and
everybody
take
the
opportunity
of
go
to
sleep
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
be
very
much
amuse
at
this
description
of
the
eloquence
of
the
dignitary
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
natural
to
him
that
people
should
go
to
sleep
in
church
who
take
no
trouble
in
seek
eloquent
preacher
.
<EOS>
"
ah
,
"
he
say
,
"
the
Church
in
England
,
which
be
my
Church
,
 
the
Church
which
I
love
,
 
be
beautiful
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
a
maiden
,
all
glorious
with
fine
raiment
.
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
she
be
mute
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
sing
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
melody
.
<EOS>
but
the
time
cometh
in
which
she
shall
sing
.
<EOS>
I
,
myself
,
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
poor
singer
in
the
great
choir
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
say
which
Mr.
Emilius
no
doubt
intend
to
allude
to
his
eloquence
as
a
preacher
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
who
could
listen
as
well
as
sing
,
and
he
be
very
careful
to
hear
well
that
which
be
be
say
in
public
about
Lady
Eustace
and
her
diamond
.
<EOS>
He
have
learn
thoroughly
what
be
her
condition
in
reference
to
the
Portray
estate
,
and
be
rejoice
rather
than
otherwise
to
find
that
she
enjoy
only
a
life
-
interest
in
the
property
.
<EOS>
have
the
thing
be
well
than
it
be
<EOS>
,
it
would
have
be
the
further
remove
from
his
reach
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
same
way
,
when
rumours
reach
him
prejudicial
to
Lizzie
in
respect
of
the
diamond
,
he
perceive
that
such
prejudice
may
work
weal
for
him
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
once
,
on
order
a
mackerel
for
dinner
,
be
tell
that
a
fresh
mackerel
would
come
to
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
a
stale
mackerel
for
sixpence
.
"
<EOS>
then
bring
me
a
stale
mackerel
,
"
say
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
covet
fish
,
but
be
aware
that
his
position
do
not
justify
him
in
expect
the
good
fish
on
the
market
.
<EOS>
the
Lord
Fawns
and
the
Frank
Greystocks
of
the
world
would
be
less
likely
to
covet
Lizzie
,
should
she
,
by
any
little
indiscretion
,
have
place
herself
under
a
temporary
cloud
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
have
carefully
observe
the
heavens
,
and
know
how
quickly
such
cloud
will
disperse
themselves
when
they
be
tinge
with
gold
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
which
Lizzie
have
do
,
or
would
be
likely
to
do
,
which
could
materially
affect
her
income
.
<EOS>
It
may
indeed
be
possible
that
the
Eustaces
should
make
her
pay
for
the
necklace
;
but
even
in
that
case
,
there
would
be
quite
enough
leave
for
that
modest
,
unambitious
comfort
which
Mr.
Emilius
desire
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
preach
,
and
not
by
wealth
,
that
he
must
make
himself
know
in
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
but
for
a
preacher
to
have
a
pretty
wife
with
a
title
and
a
good
income
,
 
and
a
castle
in
Scotland
,
 
what
an
Elysium
<EOS>
it
would
be
!
<EOS>
in
such
a
condition
he
would
envy
no
dean
,
no
bishop
,
 
no
archbishop
!
<EOS>
He
think
a
great
deal
about
it
,
and
see
no
positive
bar
to
his
success

<EOS>
She
tell
him
that
she
be
go
to
Scotland
.
"
<EOS>
not
immediately
!
"
he
exclaim
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
little
boy
be
there
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
should
not
your
little
boy
be
here
?
<EOS>
surely
,
for
people
who
can
choose
,
the
great
centre
of
the
world
offer
attraction
which
can
not
be
find
in
secluded
spot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
seclusion
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
with
rapture
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
;
I
can
believe
that
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
have
himself
witness
the
seclusion
of
Portray
Castle
,
and
have
hear
,
when
there
,
many
story
of
the
Ayrshire
hunting
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
your
nature
;
 
but
,
dear
Lady
Eustace
,
will
you
allow
me
to
say
that
our
nature
be
implant
in
us
in
accordance
with
the
fall
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
mean
to
say
that
it
be
wicked
to
like
to
be
in
Scotland
better
than
in
this
giddy
town
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
nothing
about
wicked
,
Lady
Eustace
;
but
this
I
do
say
,
that
nature
alone
will
not
lead
us
always
aright
.
<EOS>
It
be
good
to
be
at
Portray
part
of
the
year
,
no
doubt
;
but
be
there
not
blessing
in
such
a
congregation
of
humanity
as
this
London
which
you
can
not
find
at
Portray
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
hear
you
preach
,
Mr.
Emilius
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
be
something
,
too
,
Lady
Eustace
;
 
otherwise
a
great
many
people
who
kindly
come
to
hear
me
must
sadly
waste
their
time
.
<EOS>
and
your
example
to
the
world
around
;
 
be
it
not
more
serviceable
amidst
the
crowd
of
London
than
in
the
solitude
of
Scotland
?
<EOS>
there
be
more
good
to
be
do
,
Lady
Eustace
,
by
live
among
our
fellow
-
creature
than
by
desert
them
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
think
you
should
not
go
to
Scotland
before
August
,
but
should
have
your
little
boy
bring
to
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
air
of
his
native
mountain
be
everything
to
my
child
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
the
child
have
,
in
fact
,
be
bear
at
Bobsborough
,
but
that
probably
would
make
no
real
difference
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
wonder
that
I
should
plead
for
your
stay
,
"
say
Mr.
Emilius
,
throw
all
his
soul
into
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
dark
would
everything
be
to
me
if
I
miss
you
from
your
seat
in
the
house
of
praise
and
prayer
!
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
Eustace
,
like
some
other
lady
who
ought
to
be
more
appreciative
,
be
altogether
deficient
in
what
may
perhaps
be
call
good
taste
in
reference
to
man
.
<EOS>
though
she
be
clever
,
and
though
,
in
spite
of
her
ignorance
,
she
at
once
know
an
intelligent
man
from
a
fool
,
she
do
not
know
the
difference
between
a
gentleman
and
a
 
"
cad
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
in
her
estimation
something
against
Mr.
Emilius
that
he
be
a
clergyman
,
something
against
him
that
he
have
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
he
earn
,
something
against
him
that
he
be
suppose
to
be
a
renegade
Jew
,
and
that
nobody
know
whence
he
come
nor
who
he
be
.
<EOS>
these
deficiency
or
drawback
Lizzie
recognise
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
nothing
against
him
in
her
judgment
that
he
be
a
greasy
,
fawning
,
paw
,
creep
,
black
-
browe
rascal
,
who
could
not
look
her
full
in
the
face
,
and
whose
every
word
sound
like
a
lie
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
twang
in
his
voice
which
ought
to
have
tell
her
that
he
be
utterly
untrustworthy
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
oily
pretence
at
earnestness
in
his
manner
which
ought
to
have
tell
that
he
be
not
fit
to
associate
with
gentleman
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
foulness
of
demeanour
about
him
which
ought
to
have
give
to
her
,
as
a
woman
at
any
rate
bring
up
among
lady
,
an
abhorrence
of
his
society
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
Lizzie
do
not
feel
.
<EOS>
She
ridicule
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
the
idea
of
the
preacher
's
courtship
.
<EOS>
She
still
think
that
in
the
tooth
of
all
her
misfortune
she
could
do
better
with
herself
than
marry
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
She
conceive
that
the
man
must
be
impertinent
if
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
assertion
be
true
;
 
but
she
be
neither
angry
nor
disgusted
,
and
she
allow
him
to
talk
to
her
,
and
even
to
make
love
to
her
,
after
his
nasty
pseudo
-
clerical
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
surely
still
do
better
with
herself
than
marry
Mr.
Emilius
!
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
twentieth
of
March
,
and
a
fortnight
have
go
since
an
intimation
have
be
send
to
her
from
the
headquarters
of
the
police
that
Patience
Crabstick
be
in
their
hand
.
<EOS>
nothing
further
have
occur
,
and
it
may
be
that
Patience
Crabstick
have
tell
no
tale
against
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
that
Patience
have
no
tale
to
tell
,
but
it
may
be
that
Patience
,
though
she
be
in
the
hand
of
the
police
,
would
find
it
to
her
interest
to
tell
no
tale
against
her
late
mistress
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
there
be
silence
and
quiet
,
and
the
affair
of
the
diamond
seem
almost
to
be
pass
out
of
people
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Greystock
have
twice
call
in
Scotland
Yard
,
but
have
be
able
to
learn
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
be
fear
,
they
say
,
that
the
people
really
engage
in
the
robbery
<EOS>
have
get
away
scot
-
free
.
<EOS>
Frank
do
not
quite
believe
them
,
but
he
could
learn
nothing
from
them
.
<EOS>
thus
encourage
,
Lizzie
determine
that
she
would
remain
in
London
till
after
Lucinda
's
marriage
,
 
till
after
she
should
have
receive
the
promised
letter
from
Lord
Fawn
,
as
to
which
,
though
it
be
so
long
in
come
,
she
do
not
doubt
that
it
would
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
She
could
do
nothing
with
Frank
,
 
who
be
a
fool
!
<EOS>
She
could
do
nothing
with
Lord
George
,
 
who
be
a
brute
!
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
would
still
be
within
her
reach
,
if
only
the
secret
about
the
diamond
could
be
keep
a
secret
till
after
she
should
have
become
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
about
this
time
Lucinda
speak
to
her
respect
her
propose
journey
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
talk
of
go
to
Scotland
a
week
ago

Eustace

pray

not

I
should
not

<EOS>
"
You
can
not
put
it
off
now

I
should
think

say
Lizzie
;
"

as
I
have
order
my
dress
for
the
occasion
I
shall
certainly
stay

wear
it

you

I
sometimes

shall
 
murder
him

<EOS>
"
Lucinda
,
 
how
can
you
say
anything
so
horrible
!
<EOS>
but
I
see
you
be
only
joke

<EOS>
"
there
do
come
a
ghastly
smile
over
that
beautiful
face
,
which
be
so
seldom
light
up
by
any
expression
of
mirth

good
humour

<EOS>

I
wish
you
would
not

such
horrible
thing

It
would
serve
him
right

if
he
be
to
murder
me

that
would
serve
me
right

He
know
that
I
detest
him

yet
he
go
on
with
it

I
have
tell
him
so
a
score
of
time

nothing
will
make
him
give
it
up

be
not

will
be
his
triumph

up

if
it

never

Lizzie
at
last
say
that
she
would
,
at
any
rate
,
speak
to
Sir
Griffin

<EOS>
and
she
do
speak
to
Sir
Griffin
,
have
wait
three
or
four
day
for
an
opportunity
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
some
desperately
sharp
word
between
Sir
Griffin

Mrs.
Carbuncle
with
reference
to
money
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
have
be
give
to
understand
that
Lucinda
have
,
or
would
have
,
some
few
hundred
pound
,
and
insist
that
the
money
should
be
hand
over
to
him
on
the
day
of
his
marriage

<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
declare
that
the
money
be
to
come
from
property
to
be
realise
in
New
York
,
and
have
name
a
day
which
have
seem
to
Sir

to

the
Greek
Kalends

He
express
an
opinion
that

be
swindle

unable

restrain
herself

turn
upon

full
of
wrath

He
be
catch
by
Lizzie

descend
the
stair

in
the
dining

room
he
pour
out
the
tale

hear
this

from

of
the
poor

Sir
Florian

I
do
not
look

fortune

just
take
her

now
she
tell
me
that
I
can
not
have
just
the
bit
of
money

I
want

why
do
not
you

look
quickly

sharply

closely
into

ask
the
question

the
truth

,
you

Miss
Roanoke
be
always
have
 
have
little
tiff
together

sometimes
think
you
do

be
the
old
woman
I
be
complain
of
,

say
Sir
Griffin

I
be
not
go
to
marry
her

I
shall
have
see
the

out

Sir
Griffin

no

the
affair
have
go
very
far

off

no

from

in
that
way

She
shall
go
on
with
it
;
and
the
first
thing
I
mean
to
tell
her
as
my
wife
be
,
that
she
shall
never
see
that
woman
again
.
<EOS>
if
she
think
she
be
go
to
be
master
,
she
be
very
much
mistaken

<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
,
as
he
say
this
,
show
his
tooth
,
and
declare
his
purpose
to
be
masterful
by
his
feature
as
well
as
by
his
word
;
 
but
Lady
Eustace
be
,
nevertheless
,
of
opinion
that
when
the
two
come
to
an
absolute
struggle
for
mastery
,
the
lady
would
get
the
well
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
never
tell
Miss
Roanoke
of
her
want
of
success
,
or
even
of
the
effort
she
have
make
;
nor
do
the
unhappy
young
woman
come
to
her
for
any
reply
.
<EOS>
the
preparation
go
on
,
and
it
be
quite
understand
that
on
this
peculiar
occasion
Mrs.
Carbuncle
intend
to
treat
her
friend
with
profuse
hospitality
.
<EOS>
She
propose
to
give
a
breakfast
;
and
as
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
be
very
small
,
room
have
be
take
at
an
hotel
in
Albemarle
Street
.
<EOS>
Thither
,
as
the
day
of
the
marriage
draw
near
,
all
the
present
be
take
,
 
so
that
they
may
be
view
by
the
guest
,
with
the
name
of
the
donor
attach
to
them
.
<EOS>
as
some
of
the
money
give
have
be
very
much
want
indeed
,
so
that
the
actual
cheque
could
not
be
conveniently
spare
just
at
the
moment
to
pay
for
the
present
which
ought
to
have
be
buy
,
 
a
few
very
pretty
thing
be
hire
,
as
to
which
,
when
the
donor
should
see
their
name
attach
to
them
,
they
should
surely
think
that
the
money
give
have
be
lay
out
to
great
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
the
Eye
of
the
public
 
<EOS>
It
take
Lord
Fawn
a
long
time
to
write
his
letter
,
but
at
last
he
write
it
.
<EOS>
the
delay
must
not
be
take
as
throw
any
slur
on
his
character
as
a
correspondent
or
a
man
of
business
,
for
many
irritate
cause
spring
up
sufficient
to
justify
him
in
plead
that
it
arise
from
circumstance
beyond
his
own
control
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
moreover
,
feel
by
us
all
that
the
time
which
may
fairly
be
take
in
the
performance
of
any
task
depend
,
not
on
the
amount
of
work
,
but
on
the
performance
of
it
when
do
.
<EOS>
a
man
be
not
expect
to
write
a
cheque
for
a
couple
of
thousand
pound
as
readily
as
he
would
one
for
five
,
 
unless
he
be
a
man
to
whom
a
couple
of
thousand
pound
be
a
mere
nothing
.
<EOS>
to
Lord
Fawn
the
writing
of
this
letter
be
everything
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
Lizzie
,
with
much
exactness
,
what
he
would
put
into
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
again
offer
his
hand
,
 
acknowledge
himself
bind
to
do
so
by
his
former
offer
,
 
but
would
give
reason
why
she
should
not
accept
it
.
<EOS>
if
anything
should
occur
in
the
meantime
which
would
,
in
his
opinion
,
justify
him
in
again
repudiate
her
,
he
would
of
course
take
advantage
of
such
circumstance
.
<EOS>
if
ask
himself
what
be
his
prevail
motive
in
all
that
he
do
or
intend
to
do
,
he
would
have
declare
that
it
be
above
all
thing
necessary
that
he
should
"
put
himself
right
in
the
eye
of
the
british
public
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
able
to
do
this
without
interference
from
the
judgment
of
other
.
<EOS>
both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hittaway
interfere
;
and
he
could
not
prevent
himself
from
listen
to
them
and
believe
them
,
though
he
would
contradict
all
they
say
,
and
snub
all
their
theory
.
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
also
continue
to
interfere
,
and
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
.
<EOS>
even
John
Eustace
have
be
work
upon
to
write
to
Lord
Fawn
,
state
his
opinion
,
as
trustee
for
his
late
brother
's
property
,
that
the
Eustace
family
do
not
think
that
there
be
ground
of
complaint
against
Lady
Eustace
in
reference
to
the
diamond
which
have
be
steal
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
terrible
blow
to
Lord
Fawn
,
and
have
come
,
no
doubt
,
from
a
general
agreement
among
the
Eustace
faction
,
 
include
the
bishop
,
John
Eustace
,
and
even
Mr.
Camperdown
,
 
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
get
the
widow
marry
and
place
under
some
decent
control
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
absolutely
have
the
effrontery
to
ask
him
whether
the
marriage
be
not
go
to
take
place
,
and
when
a
day
would
be
fix
.
<EOS>
He
gather
up
his
courage
to
give
her
ladyship
a
rebuke
.
<EOS>
"
My
private
affair
do
seem
to
be
uncommonly
interesting
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
yes
,
Lord
Fawn
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
whom
nothing
could
abash
;
 
"
most
interesting

<EOS>
You
see
,
dear
Lady
Eustace
be
so
very
popular

that
we
all
want
to
know
what
be
to
be
her
fate

<EOS>
"
I
regret
to

that
I
can
not
answer
your
ladyship
's
question
with
any
precision

say
Lord
Fawn

the

persecution
be
by

the
bad

You

the

<EOS>

I
do
not

my
conduct

I
have
have
the
honour

I
have

so

no

if
I
fail

I
shall
grieve

I
can
not
on
that
account
act
otherwise
than
in

<EOS>
Mrs.
Hittaway
know
her
brother
well
,
and
be
not
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
be
all
very
well
;
and
I
be
sure
you
know
,
Frederic
,
how
proud
we
all
be
of
you

<EOS>
but
this
woman
be
a
nasty
,
low
,
scheming
,
ill
-
conduct
,
dishonest
little
wretch
;
and
if
you
make
her
your
wife
you
will
be
miserable
all
your
life

<EOS>
nothing
would
make
me
and
Orlando
so
unhappy
as
to
quarrel
with
you
.
<EOS>
but
we
know
that
it
be
so
,
and
to
the
last
minute
I
shall
say
so
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
ask
her
to
her
face
about
that
man
down
in
Scotland
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Clara

perhaps
I
know
what
to
ask
her

what
not
to
ask
her
well
than
you
can
tell
me

"
  
<EOS>
and
his

be
quite
as
bad

"
<EOS>
fawn
,
"
he
say
,
"
in
this
matter
of
Lady
Eustace
,
do
not
you
think
you
ought
to
put
your
conduct
into
the
hand
of
some
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
by
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
an
affair
in
which
a
man
would
have
so
much
comfort
in
be
able
to
say
that
he
be
guide
by
advice
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
her
people
want
you
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
now
,
if
you
could
just
tell
them
that
the
whole
thing
be
in
the
hand

,
 
say
me
,
 
or
any
other
friend
,
you
would
be
relieve
,
you
know
,
of
so
much
responsibility
.
<EOS>
They
may
hammer
away
at
me
ever
so
long
,
and
I
should
not
care
twopence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
to
be
any
hammering
,
it
can
not
be
bear
vicariously
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
say
it
,
he
be
quite
pleased
by
his
own
sharpness
and
wit
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
,
indeed
,
put
himself
beyond
protection
by
vicarious
endurance
of
hammering
when
he
promise
to
write
to
Lady
Eustace
,
explain
his
own
conduct
and
give
reason
.
<EOS>
have
anything
turn
up
in
Scotland
Yard
which
would
have
justify
him
in
say
,
 
or
even
in
thinking
,
 
that
Lizzie
have
steal
her
own
diamond
,
he
would
have
send
word
to
her
that
he
must
abstain
from
any
communication
till
that
matter
have
be
clear
up
;
but
since
the
appearance
of
that
mysterious
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
,
nothing
have
be
hear
of
the
robbery
,
and
public
opinion
certainly
seem
to
be
in
favour
of
Lizzie
's
innocence
.
<EOS>
He
do
think
that
the
Eustace
faction
be
betray
him
,
as
he
could
not
but
remember
how
eager
Mr.
Camperdown
have
be
in
assert
that
the
widow
be
keep
an
enormous
amount
of
property
and
claim
it
as
her
own
,
whereas
,
in
truth
,
she
have
not
the
slight
title
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
in
a
great
measure
,
in
consequence
of
the
assertion
of
the
Eustace
faction
,
almost
in
obedience
to
their
advice
,
that
he
have
resolve
to
break
off
the
match
;
and
now
they
turn
upon
him
,
and
John
Eustace
absolutely
go
out
of
his
way
to
write
him
a
letter
which
be
clearly
mean
to
imply
that
he
,
Lord
Fawn
,
be
bind
to
marry
the
woman
to
whom
he
have
once
engage
himself
!
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
feel
that
he
be
ill
-
use
,
and
that
a
man
may
have
to
undergo
a
great
deal
of
bad
treatment
who
should
strive
to
put
himself
right
in
the
eye
of
the
public
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
write
his
letter
,
 
on
a
Wednesday
,
which
with
him
have
something
of
the
comfort
of
a
half
-
holiday
,
as
on
that
day
he
be
not
require
to
attend
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
India
Office
,
28th
March
,
18
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
lady
eustace
,
  
<EOS>
in
accordance
with
the
promise
which
I
make
to
you
when
I
do
myself
the
honour
of
wait
upon
you
in
Hertford
Street
,
I
take
up
my
pen
with
the
view
of
communicate
to
you
the
result
of
my
deliberation
respect
the
engagement
of
marriage
which
,
no
doubt
,
do
exist
between
us
last
summer
.
  
<EOS>
since
that
time
I
have
no
doubt
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
that
engagement
be
over
;
and
I
be
free
to
admit
that
I
do
so
without
any
assent
or
agreement
on
your
part
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
such
conduct
no
doubt
require
a
valid
and
strong
defence
.
<EOS>
My
defence
be
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
I
learn
that
you
be
in
possession
of
a
large
amount
of
property
,
vest
in
diamond
,
which
be
claim
by
the
executor
under
your
late
husband
's
will
as
belong
to
his
estate
;
and
as
to
which
they
declare
,
in
the
most
positive
manner
,
that
you
have
no
right
or
title
to
it
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
I
consult
friend
and
I
consult
lawyer
,
and
I
be
lead
to
the
conviction
that
this
property
certainly
do
not
belong
to
you
.
<EOS>
have
I
marry
you
in
these
circumstance
,
I
could
not
but
have
become
a
participator
in
the
lawsuit
which
I
be
assure
would
be
commence
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
a
participator
with
you
,
because
I
believe
you
to
be
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
and
I
certainly
could
not
participate
with
those
who
would
in
such
case
be
attack
my
own
wife
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
condition
of
thing
I
request
you
,
 
as
you
must
,
I
think
,
yourself
own
,
with
all
deference
and
good
feeling
,
 
to
give
up
the
actual
possession
of
the
property
,
and
to
place
the
diamond
in
neutral
hand
,
 
<EOS>
[
Lord
Fawn
be
often
call
upon
to
be
neutral
in
reference
to
the
condition
of
outlying
indian
principality
]
 
<EOS>
till
the
law
should
have
decide
as
to
their
ownership
.
<EOS>
as
regard
myself
,
I
neither
covet
nor
reject
the
possession
of
that
wealth
for
my
future
wife
.
<EOS>
I
desire
simply
to
be
free
from
an
embarrassment
which
would
have
overwhelm
me
.
<EOS>
You
decline
my
request
,
 
not
only
positively
,
but
perhaps
I
may
add
peremptorily
;
and
then
I
be
bind
to
adhere
to
the
decision
I
have
communicate
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
since
that
time
the
property
have
be
steal
and
,
as
I
believe
,
dissipate
.
<EOS>
the
lawsuit
against
you
have
be
withdraw
;
and
the
bone
of
contention
,
so
to
say
,
be
no
longer
exist
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
longer
justify
in
decline
to
keep
my
engagement
because
of
the
prejudice
to
which
I
should
have
be
subject
by
your
possession
of
the
diamond
;
 
and
,
therefore
,
as
far
as
that
go
,
I
withdraw
my
withdrawal
.
<EOS>
[
this
Lord
Fawn
think
be
rather
a
happy
phrase
,
and
he
read
it
aloud
to
himself
more
than
once
.
]
  
<EOS>
but
now
there
arise
the
question
whether
,
in
both
our
interest
,
this
marriage
should
go
on
,
or
whether
it
may
not
be
more
conducive
to
your
happiness
and
to
mine
that
it
should
be
annul
for
cause
altogether
irrespective
of
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
in
a
matter
so
serious
as
marriage
,
the
happiness
of
the
two
party
be
that
which
require
graver
think
than
any
other
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
no
doubt
spring
up
between
us
a
feeling
of
mutual
distrust
,
which
have
lead
to
recrimination
,
and
which
be
hardly
compatible
with
that
perfect
confidence
which
should
exist
between
a
man
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
this
first
arise
,
no
doubt
,
from
the
different
view
which
we
take
as
to
that
property
of
which
I
have
speak
,
 
and
as
to
which
your
judgment
may
possibly
have
be
well
than
mine
.
<EOS>
on
that
head
I
will
add
nothing
to
what
I
have
already
say
;
but
the
feeling
have
arise
;
and
I
fear
it
can
not
be
so
perfectly
allay
as
to
admit
of
that
reciprocal
trust
without
which
we
could
not
live
happily
together
.
<EOS>
I
confess
that
for
my
own
part
I
do
not
now
desire
a
union
which
be
once
the
great
object
of
my
ambition
,
 
and
that
I
could
not
go
to
the
altar
with
you
without
fear
and
tremble
.
<EOS>
as
to
your
own
feeling
,
you
best
know
what
they
be
.
<EOS>
I
bring
no
charge
against
you
;
 
but
if
you
have
cease
to
love
me
,
I
think
you
should
cease
to
wish
to
be
my
wife
,
and
that
you
should
not
insist
upon
a
marriage
simply
because
by
do
so
you
would
triumph
over
a
former
objection
.
  
<EOS>
before
he
finish
this
paragraph
,
he
think
much
of
Andy
Gowran
and
of
the
scene
among
the
rock
of
which
he
have
hear
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
find
himself
unable
to
examine
the
witness
who
have
be
bring
to
him
,
and
have
honestly
tell
himself
that
he
could
not
take
that
charge
as
prove
.
<EOS>
Andy
Gowran
may
have
lie
.
<EOS>
in
his
heart
he
believe
that
Andy
Gowran
have
lie
.
<EOS>
the
matter
be
distasteful
to
him
,
and
he
would
not
touch
it
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
know
that
the
woman
do
not
love
him
,
and
he
long
to
tell
her
so
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
what
we
may
each
gain
or
each
lose
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
,
either
by
marry
or
not
marry
,
I
will
not
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
You
have
rank
and
wealth
,
and
therefore
I
can
comfort
myself
by
think
that
if
I
dissuade
you
from
this
marriage
I
shall
rob
you
of
neither
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
that
I
wish
to
dissuade
you
,
as
I
believe
that
we
should
not
make
each
other
happy
.
<EOS>
as
,
however
,
I
do
consider
that
I
be
bind
to
keep
my
engagement
to
you
if
you
demand
that
I
shall
do
so
<EOS>
,
I
leave
the
matter
in
your
hand
for
decision
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
,
and
shall
remain
,
  
<EOS>
Your
sincere
friend
,
  
FAWN
.
  
<EOS>
He
read
the
letter
and
copy
it
,
and
give
himself
great
credit
for
the
composition
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
it
be
impossible
that
any
woman
after
read
it
should
express
a
wish
to
become
the
wife
of
the
man
who
write
it
;
and
yet
,
 
so
he
believe
,
 
no
man
or
woman
could
find
fault
with
him
for
write
it
.
<EOS>
there
certainly
be
one
view
of
the
case
which
be
very
distressing
.
<EOS>
how
would
it
be
with
him
if
,
after
all
,
she
should
say
that
she
would
marry
him
?
<EOS>
after
have
give
her
her
choice
,
 
have
put
it
all
in
writing
,
 
he
could
not
again
go
back
from
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
in
her
power
,
and
of
what
use
would
his
life
be
to
him
?
<EOS>
Would
Parliament
,
or
the
India
Office
,
or
the
eye
of
the
public
be
able
to
comfort
him
then
in
the
midst
of
his
many
misery
?
<EOS>
what
could
he
do
with
a
wife
whom
he
marry
with
a
declaration
that
he
dislike
her
?
<EOS>
with
such
feeling
as
be
his
,
how
could
he
stand
before
a
clergyman
and
take
an
oath
that
he
would
love
her
and
cherish
her
?
<EOS>
Would
she
not
ever
be
as
an
adder
to
him
,
 
as
an
adder
whom
it
would
be
impossible
that
he
should
admit
into
his
bosom
?
<EOS>
Could
he
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
;
and
if
so
,
could
he
ask
his
mother
and
sister
to
visit
her
?
<EOS>
He
remember
well
what
Mrs.
Hittaway
have
call
her
;
 
a
nasty
,
low
,
scheming
,
ill
-
conduct
,
dishonest
little
wretch
!
<EOS>
and
he
believe
that
she
be
so
!
<EOS>
yet
he
be
once
again
offer
to
marry
her
,
should
she
choose
to
accept
him
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
the
letter
be
send
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
in
truth
,
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
He
have
promise
that
he
would
write
such
a
letter
,
and
all
that
have
remain
to
him
be
the
power
of
cram
into
it
every
available
argument
against
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
this
he
have
do
,
and
,
as
he
think
,
have
do
well
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
she
should
desire
to
marry
him
after
read
such
a
letter
as
that
!
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
receive
it
in
her
bedroom
,
where
she
breakfast
,
and
tell
of
its
arrival
to
her
friend
Mrs.
Carbuncle
as
soon
as
they
meet
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
have
come
down
from
his
high
horse
at
last
,
"
she
say
,
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
 
Lord
Fawn
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
what
other
lord
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
lord
for
me

<EOS>
He
be
my
lord
,
my
peer
of
Parliament
,
my
Cabinet
minister
,
my
right

my
member
of
the
Government

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
say
;
 
what
should
he
say
?
 
<EOS>
just
that
he
have
behave
very
badly
,
and
that
he
hope
I
shall
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
quite
that
;
do
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
it
all
mean
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
there
be
ever
so
much
of
it
,
 
page
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
Lord
Fawn
if
he
do
not
spin
it
all
out
like
an
Act
of
Parliament
,
with
"
whereas
"
and
"
wherein
,
"
and
"
whereof
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
full
of
all
that
;
but
the
meaning
of
it
be
that
he
be
at
my
foot
again
,
and
that
I
may
pick
him
up
if
I
choose
to
take
him
.
<EOS>
I
would
show
you
the
letter
,
only
perhaps
it
would
not
be
fair
to
the
poor
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
excuse
do
he
make
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
 
as
to
that
he
be
rational
enough
.
<EOS>
He
call
the
necklace
the
 
bone
of
contention
.
<EOS>
that
be
rather
good
for
Lord
Fawn
;
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
the
bone
of
contention
,
he
say
,
have
be
remove
;
and
,
therefore
,
there
be
no
reason
why
we
should
not
marry
if
we
like
it
.
<EOS>
He
shall
hear
enough
about
the
bone
of
contention
if
we
do
"
marry
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
shall
you
do
now

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes

that
be
easily
ask
;
be
it
not

<EOS>
the
man
be
a
good
sort
of
man
in
his
way
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
drink
or
gamble
;
and
I
do
not
think
there
be
a
bit
of
the
King
David
about
him

that
I
do
not

virtue
personify

I
should
say

and
he
be
not

"
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
not
have
him
and
have
do
with
it
?
"
ask
Mrs.

.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
such
a
lumpy
man
,
"
say
Lizzie
;
 
"
such
an
ass

a

paper

I

"
what
do
you

"
  
"
nothing
very
much
;

still
,
you
see
,
they
may
come
again

<EOS>
as
to
Lord
George
,
we
all
know
that
he
have
not
get
a
penny

piece
in
the
world
that
he

<EOS>
"
if

Lord

be
nothing

"
I
know
very
well
what
my

<EOS>
He
and
I
understand
each

thoroughly
;

cousin
can
love
one
another
very
well
without
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
know
your
own
business
,
but
if
I
be
you
I
would
take
Lord
Fawn

<EOS>
I
speak
in
true
kindness
,
 
as
one
woman
to
another

<EOS>
after
all
,
what
do
love
signify
?
<EOS>
how
much
real
love
do
we
ever
see
among
married
people
?
<EOS>
do
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
really
love
her
husband
,
who
think
of
nothing
in
the
world
but
put
taxis
on
and
off
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
love
your
husband

Mrs.

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;

that
be
a
different
kind
of
thing

circumstance
have
cause
me
to
live
apart
from
him
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
a
good
man
,

there
be
no
reason
why
you
should
not
respect
him
,
and
treat
him
well

He
will
give
you
a
fix
position

which
really
you

"
  
"
Tooriloo
,
tooriloo
,
tooriloo
,
looriloo
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
in
contemptuous
disdain
of
her
friend
's
caution
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
all
this
trouble
about
the
diamond
and
the
robbery
will
be
over
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
look
at
her
very
intently
.
<EOS>
what
should
make
Mrs.
Carbuncle
suppose
that
there
need
be
,
or
,
indeed
,
could
be
,
any
further
trouble
about
the
diamond
?
  
<EOS>
"
so
;
 
that
be
your
advice
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
half
inclined
to
take
it
,
and
perhaps
I
shall
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
bring
him
round
,
and
that
be
something
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
and
either
one
way
or
the
other
,
I
shall
let
him
know
that
I
like
my
triumph
.
<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
have
it
,
and
I
have
get
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
she
read
the
letter
again
very
seriously
.
<EOS>
Could
she
possibly
marry
a
man
who
in
so
many
word
tell
her
that
he
do
not
want
her
?
<EOS>
well
;
 
she
think
she
could
.
<EOS>
be
not
everybody
treat
everybody
else
much
in
the
same
way
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
love
her
Corsair
truly
,
 
and
how
have
he
treat
her
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
be
true
,
disintereste
,
and
most
affectionate
to
Frank
Greystock
;
and
what
have
she
get
from
him
?
<EOS>
to
manage
her
business
wisely
,
and
put
herself
upon
firm
ground
;
 
that
be
her
duty
at
present
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
right
there
.
<EOS>
the
very
name
of
Lady
Fawn
would
be
a
rock
to
her
,
 
and
she
want
a
rock
.
<EOS>
She
think
upon
the
whole
that
she
could
marry
him
;
 
unless
Patience
Crabstick
and
the
police
should
again
interfere
with
her
prosperity
.
   
<EOS>
the
major
 
Lady
Eustace
do
not
intend
to
take
as
much
time
in
answer
Lord
Fawn
's
letter
as
he
have
take
in
write
it
;
but
even
she
find
that
the
subject
be
one
which
demand
a
good
deal
of
thought
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
very
freely
recommend
her
to
take
the
man
,
support
her
advice
by
argument
which
Lizzie
feel
to
be
valid
;
but
then
Mrs.
Carbuncle
do
not
know
all
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
not
actually
see
his
lordship
's
letter
;
and
though
the
great
part
of
the
letter
,
the
formal
repetition
,
namely
,
of
the
writer
's
offer
of
marriage
,
have
be
truly
tell
to
her
,
still
,
as
the
reader
will
have
perceive
,
she
have
be
keep
in
the
dark
as
to
some
of
the
detail
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
do
sit
at
her
desk
with
the
object
of
put
a
few
word
together
in
order
that
she
may
see
how
they
look
,
and
she
find
that
there
be
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
be
engage
to
marry
each
other
,
and
as
all
our
friend
have
be
tell
,
I
think
that
the
thing
have
better
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
,
after
various
attempt
,
be
,
she
think
,
the
good
letter
that
she
could
send
,
 
if
she
should
make
up
her
mind
to
be
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
morning
of
the
30th
of
March
she
have
not
send
her
letter
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
herself
that
she
would
take
two
day
to
think
of
her
reply
,
 
and
,
on
the
Friday
morning
the
few
word
she
have
prepare
be
still
lie
in
her
desk
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
she
to
get
by
marry
a
man
she
absolutely
dislike
?
<EOS>
that
he
also
absolutely
dislike
her
be
not
a
matter
much
in
her
thought
.
<EOS>
the
man
would
not
ill
-
treat
her
because
he
dislike
her
;
or
,
it
may
perhaps
be
juster
to
say
,
that
the
ill
-
treatment
which
she
may
fairly
anticipate
would
not
be
of
a
nature
which
would
much
affect
her
comfort
grievously
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
beat
her
,
nor
rob
her
,
nor
lock
her
up
,
nor
starve
her
.
<EOS>
He
would
either
neglect
her
,
or
preach
sermon
to
her
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
she
could
console
herself
by
the
attention
of
other
;
and
should
he
preach
,
<EOS>
perhaps
she
could
preach
too
,
 
as
sharply
if
not
as
lengthily
as
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
she
be
not
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
but
what
would
she
gain
?
<EOS>
It
be
very
well
to
have
a
rock
,
as
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
say
,
but
a
rock
be
not
everything
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
whether
she
care
much
for
live
upon
a
rock
.
<EOS>
even
stability
may
be
purchase
at
too
high
a
price
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
grain
of
poetry
in
the
whole
composition
of
Lord
Fawn
,
and
poetry
be
what
her
very
soul
crave
;
 
poetry
,
together
with
house
,
champagne
,
jewel
,
and
admiration
.
<EOS>
Her
income
be
still
her
own
,
and
she
do
not
quite
see
that
the
rock
be
so
absolutely
necessary
to
her
.
<EOS>
then
she
write
another
note
to
Lord
Fawn
,
a
speciman
of
a
note
,
so
that
she
may
have
the
opportunity
of
compare
the
two
.
<EOS>
this
note
take
her
much
longer
than
the
one
first
write
.
  
<EOS>
my
LORD
,
    
I
do
not
know
how
to
acknowledge
with
sufficient
humility
the
condescension
and
great
kindness
of
your
lordship
's
letter
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
its
manly
generosity
be
more
conspicuous
than
either
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
my
lord
,
you
want
to
escape
from
your
engagement
,
but
be
too
much
afraid
of
the
consequence
to
dare
to
do
so
by
any
act
of
your
own
;
 
therefore
you
throw
it
upon
me
.
<EOS>
You
be
quite
successful
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
you
ever
read
poetry
,
but
perhaps
you
may
understand
the
two
follow
line
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
constrain
to
say
,
your
lordship
's
scullion
Should
sooner
be
my
husband
than
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
see
through
you
,
and
despise
you
thoroughly
.
  
<EOS>
E.
EUSTACE
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
compare
the
two
answer
together
,
very
much
in
doubt
as
to
which
should
be
send
,
when
there
come
a
message
to
her
by
a
man
whom
she
know
to
be
a
policeman
,
though
he
do
not
announce
himself
as
such
,
and
be
dress
in
plain
clothe
.
<EOS>
Major
Mackintosh
send
his
compliment
to
her
,
and
would
wait
upon
her
that
afternoon
at
three
o'clock
,
if
she
would
have
the
kindness
to
receive
him
.
<EOS>
at
the
first
moment
of
see
the
man
she
feel
that
after
all
the
rock
be
what
she
want
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
right
.
<EOS>
She
have
have
trouble
and
may
have
more
,
and
the
rock
be
the
thing
.
<EOS>
but
then
the
more
certainly
do
she
become
convinced
of
this
by
the
presence
of
the
major
's
messenger
,
the
more
clearly
do
she
see
the
difficulty
of
attain
the
security
which
the
rock
offer
.
<EOS>
if
this
public
exposure
should
fall
upon
her
,
Lord
Fawn
's
renew
offer
,
as
she
know
well
,
would
stand
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
if
once
it
be
know
that
she
have
keep
the
necklace
,
 
her
own
necklace
,
 
under
her
pillow
at
Carlisle
,
he
would
want
no
further
justification
in
repudiate
her
,
be
it
for
the
tenth
time
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
very
uncivil
to
the
messenger
,
and
the
more
so
because
she
find
that
the
man
bear
her
rudeness
without
turn
upon
her
and
rend
her
.
<EOS>
when
she
declare
that
the
police
have
behave
very
badly
,
and
that
Major
Mackintosh
be
inexcusable
in
trouble
her
again
,
and
that
she
have
cease
to
care
twopence
about
the
necklace
,
 
the
man
make
no
remonstrance
to
her
petulance
.
<EOS>
He
own
that
the
trouble
be
very
great
,
and
the
police
very
inefficient
.
<EOS>
He
almost
own
that
the
major
be
inexcusable
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
care
what
he
own
so
that
he
achieve
his
object
.
<EOS>
but
when
Lizzie
say
that
she
could
not
see
Major
Mackintosh
at
three
,
and
object
equally
to
two
,
four
,
or
five
;
then
the
courteous
messenger
from
Scotland
Yard
do
say
a
word
to
make
her
understand
that
there
must
be
a
meeting
,
 
and
he
hint
also
that
the
major
be
do
a
most
unusually
good
-
natured
thing
in
come
to
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
Lizzie
make
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
if
the
major
choose
to
come
,
she
would
be
at
home
at
three
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
policeman
be
go
,
she
sit
alone
,
with
a
manner
very
much
change
from
that
which
she
have
wear
since
the
arrival
of
Lord
Fawn
's
letter
,
 
with
a
fresh
weight
of
care
upon
her
,
great
perhaps
than
she
have
ever
hitherto
borne
.
<EOS>
She
have
have
bad
moment
,
 
when
,
for
instance
,
she
have
be
take
before
the
magistrate
at
Carlisle
,
when
she
find
the
police
in
her
house
on
her
return
from
the
theatre
,
and
when
Lord
George
have
force
her
secret
from
her
.
<EOS>
but
at
each
of
these
period
hope
have
come
renew
before
despair
have
crush
her
.
<EOS>
now
it
seem
to
her
that
the
thing
be
do
and
that
the
game
be
over
.
<EOS>
this
chief
man
of
the
London
police
no
doubt
know
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
only
already
have
climb
upon
some
rock
,
so
that
there
may
be
a
man
bind
to
defend
her
,
 
a
man
at
any
rate
bind
to
put
himself
forward
on
her
behalf
and
do
whatever
may
be
do
in
her
defence
,
 
she
may
have
endure
it
!
  
<EOS>
what
should
she
do
now
,
 
at
this
minute
?
<EOS>
She
look
at
her
watch
and
find
that
it
be
already
past
one
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
as
she
know
,
be
closet
up
-
stair
with
Lucinda
,
whose
wedding
be
fix
for
the
follow
Monday
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
Friday
.
<EOS>
be
she
to
call
upon
Mrs.
Carbuncle
for
aid
,
no
aid
would
be
forthcoming
unless
she
be
to
tell
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
She
almost
think
that
she
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
how
great
would
have
be
her
indiscretion
if
,
after
all
,
when
the
major
should
come
,
she
should
discover
that
he
do
not
know
the
truth
himself
!
<EOS>
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
keep
her
secret
<EOS>
she
do
not
for
a
moment
think
.
<EOS>
She
long
for
the
comfort
of
some
friend
's
counsel
,
but
she
find
at
last
that
she
could
not
purchase
it
by
tell
everything
to
a
woman
.
  
<EOS>
may
it
not
be
possible
that
she
should
still
run
away
?
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
much
of
the
law
,
but
she
think
that
they
could
not
punish
her
for
break
an
appointment
even
with
a
man
so
high
in
authority
as
Major
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
She
could
leave
a
note
say
that
press
business
call
her
out
.
<EOS>
but
whither
should
she
go
?
<EOS>
She
think
of
take
a
cab
to
the
House
of
Commons
,
find
her
cousin
,
and
tell
him
everything
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
so
much
well
that
he
should
see
the
major
.
<EOS>
but
then
again
,
it
may
be
that
she
should
be
mistake
as
to
the
amount
of
the
major
's
information
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
she
almost
determine
to
fly
off
at
once
to
Scotland
,
leave
word
that
she
be
oblige
to
go
instantly
to
her
child
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
direct
train
to
Scotland
before
eight
or
nine
in
the
evening
,
and
during
the
intervene
hour
the
police
would
have
ample
time
to
find
her
.
<EOS>
what
,
indeed
,
could
she
do
with
herself
during
these
intervene
hour
?
<EOS>
ah
,
if
she
have
but
a
rock
now
,
so
that
she
nee
not
be
dependent
altogether
on
the
exercise
of
her
own
intellect
!
  
<EOS>
gradually
the
minute
pass
by
,
and
she
become
aware
that
she
must
face
the
major
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
what
have
she
do
?
<EOS>
She
have
steal
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
have
take
no
person
's
property
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
indeed
,
be
wickedly
rob
,
and
the
police
have
do
nothing
to
get
back
for
her
her
property
,
as
they
be
bind
to
have
do
.
<EOS>
She
would
take
care
to
tell
the
major
what
she
think
about
the
negligence
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
the
major
should
not
have
the
talk
all
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
if
it
have
not
be
for
one
word
with
which
Lord
George
have
stun
her
ear
,
she
could
still
have
bear
it
well
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
a
lie
;
 
perhaps
two
or
three
lie
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
have
lie
.
<EOS>
but
then
people
lie
every
day
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
mind
it
much
if
she
be
simply
to
be
call
a
liar
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
tell
her
that
she
would
be
accuse
of
 
perjury
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
frightful
to
her
in
the
name
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
,
she
know
not
what
,
dreadful
penalty
attach
to
it
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
have
tell
her
that
she
may
be
put
in
prison
,
 
whether
he
have
say
for
year
or
for
month
she
have
forget
.
<EOS>
and
she
think
she
have
hear
of
people
's
property
be
confiscate
to
the
Crown
when
they
have
be
make
out
to
be
guilty
of
certain
great
offence
.
<EOS>
oh
,
how
she
wish
that
she
have
a
rock
!
  
<EOS>
when
three
o'clock
come
she
have
not
start
for
Scotland
or
elsewhere
,
and
at
last
she
receive
the
major
.
<EOS>
Could
she
have
thoroughly
trust
the
servant
,
she
would
have
deny
herself
at
the
last
moment
,
but
she
fear
that
she
may
be
betray
,
and
she
think
that
her
position
would
be
render
even
bad
than
it
be
at
present
by
a
futile
attempt
.
<EOS>
She
be
sit
alone
,
pale
,
haggard
,
tremble
,
when
Major
Mackintosh
be
show
into
her
room
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
as
well
explain
at
once
that
,
at
this
moment
,
the
major
know
,
or
think
that
he
know
,
every
circumstance
of
the
two
robbery
,
and
that
his
surmise
be
in
every
respect
right
.
<EOS>
Miss
Crabstick
and
Mr.
Cann
be
in
comfortable
quarter
,
and
be
prepared
to
tell
all
that
they
could
tell
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Smiler
be
in
durance
,
and
Mr.
Benjamin
be
at
Vienna
,
in
the
hand
of
the
austrian
police
,
who
be
prepared
to
give
him
up
to
those
who
desire
his
society
in
England
,
on
the
completion
of
certain
legal
formality
.
<EOS>
that
Mr.
Benjamin
and
Mr.
Smiler
would
be
prosecute
,
the
latter
for
the
robbery
and
the
former
for
conspiracy
to
rob
,
and
for
receive
steal
good
,
be
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
to
be
do
with
Lady
Eustace
?
<EOS>
that
,
at
the
present
moment
,
be
the
prevail
trouble
with
the
police
.
<EOS>
during
the
last
three
week
every
precaution
have
be
take
to
keep
the
matter
secret
,
and
it
be
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
Lizzie
's
interest
be
handle
not
only
with
consideration
but
with
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Eustace
,
"
say
the
major
,
"
I
be
very
sorry
to
trouble
you
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
the
man
who
call
on
you
this
morning
explain
to
you
who
I
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
I
know
who
you
be
,
 
quite
well
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
make
a
great
effort
to
speak
without
betray
her
consternation
;
but
she
be
nearly
prostrate
.
<EOS>
the
major
,
however
,
hardly
observe
her
,
and
be
by
no
mean
at
ease
himself
in
his
effort
to
save
her
from
unnecessary
annoyance
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
,
thin
,
gaunt
man
of
about
forty
,
with
large
,
good
-
natured
eye
;
 
but
it
be
not
till
the
interview
be
half
over
that
Lizzie
take
courage
to
look
even
into
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
so
;
I
be
come
,
you
know
,
about
the
robbery
which
take
place
here
,
 
and
the
other
robbery
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
so
troubled
about
these
horrid
robbery
!
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
they
will
be
the
death
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Lady
Eustace
,
we
have
find
out
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
 
you
have
be
so
long
 
find
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
have
very
clever
people
to
deal
with
,
Lady
Eustace
;
 
and
I
fear
that
,
even
now
,
we
shall
never
get
back
the
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
about
the
property
,
sir
;
 
although
it
be
all
my
own
.
<EOS>
nobody
have
lose
anything
but
myself
;
and
I
really
do
not
see
why
the
thing
should
not
die
out
,
as
I
do
not
care
about
it
.
<EOS>
whoever
it
be
,
they
may
have
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
bind
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
all
,
if
we
could
;
and
I
think
that
we
have
,
 
at
last
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
as
you
say
,
we
ought
to
have
do
it
sooner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
 
I
do
not
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
two
person
in
custody
,
Lady
Eustace
,
whom
we
shall
use
as
witness
,
and
I
be
afraid
we
shall
have
to
call
upon
you
also
,
 
as
a
witness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
occur
to
Lizzie
that
they
could
not
lock
her
up
in
prison
and
make
her
a
witness
too
,
but
she
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
then
the
major
continue
his
speech
,
 
and
ask
her
the
question
which
be
,
in
fact
,
alone
material
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
Lady
Eustace
,
you
be
not
bind
to
say
anything
to
me
unless
you
like
it
,
 
<EOS>
and
you
must
understand
that
I
by
no
means
wish
you
to
criminate
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
that
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
yourself
have
do
anything
wrong
,
I
do
not
want
to
ask
you
to
confess
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
all
my
diamond
steal
,
if
you
mean
that
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
wrong
to
have
diamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
to
come
to
my
question
,
 
I
suppose
we
may
take
it
for
grant
that
the
diamond
be
in
your
desk
when
the
thief
make
their
entrance
into
this
house
,
and
break
the
desk
open
,
and
steal
the
money
out
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
breathe
so
hardly
,
that
she
be
quite
unable
to
speak
.
<EOS>
the
man
's
voice
be
very
gentle
and
very
kind
,
 
but
then
how
could
she
admit
that
one
fact
?
<EOS>
all
depend
on
that
one
fact
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
woman
Crabstick
,
"
say
the
major
,
"
have
confess
,
and
will
state
on
her
oath
that
she
see
the
necklace
in
your
hand
in
Hertford
Street
,
and
that
she
see
it
place
in
the
desk
.
<EOS>
She
then
give
information
of
this
to
Benjamin
,
 
as
she
have
before
give
information
as
to
your
journey
up
from
Scotland
,
 
and
she
be
introduce
to
the
two
man
whom
she
let
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
,
indeed
,
who
will
also
give
evidence
for
us
,
she
have
before
meet
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
She
then
be
present
when
the
necklace
be
take
out
of
the
desk
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
open
the
desk
and
take
it
out
,
who
also
cut
the
door
at
Carlisle
,
will
give

They

at

you

there
can

no

no

you

take

not

take

I
do
it
in

"
yes
,
 
sir

I
should
tell
you

Lady
Eustace

that
I
have
not
a
doubt
about
this
before
I
come
here
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
past
I
have
think
that
it
must
be
so
;
and
latterly
the
confession
of
two
of
the
accomplice
have
make
it
certain
to
me
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
housebreaker
and
the
jeweller
will
be
try
for
the
felony

I
be
afraid
that
you
must
undergo
the
annoyance

be
one
of
the
witness

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
will
they
do
to
me
,
Major
Mackintosh

"
<EOS>
Lizzie
now
for
the
first
time
look
up
into
his
eye
,
and
feel
that
they
be
kind
.
<EOS>
Could
he
be
her
rock
?
<EOS>
He
do
not
speak
to
her
like
an
enemy
;
 
and
then
,
too
,
he
would
know
better
than
any
man
alive
how
she
may
best
escape
from
her
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
ask
you
to
tell
the
truth

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
will
do
that
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
 
not
aware
that
,
after
so
many
lie
,
it
may
be
difficult
to
tell
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
probably
be
ask
to
repeat
it
,
this
way
and
that
,
in
a
manner
that
will
be
troublesome
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
here
in
London
,
and
at
Carlisle
,
you
have
 
give
incorrect
version
.

<EOS>
"
I
know
I
have
.
<EOS>
but
the
necklace
be
my
own

there
be
nothing
dishonest
;
 
be
there
,
Major
Mackintosh
?
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
me
at
Carlisle
<EOS>
I
be
so
confused
that
I
hardly
know
what
to
tell
them
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
once
 
give
an
incorrect
version
,
you
know
,
I
do
not
know
how
to
go
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
major
be
not
so
well
acquaint
with
Lizzie
as
be
the
reader
,
and
he
pity
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
understand
all
that
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
how
much
kinder
he
be
than
Lord
George
have
be
when
she
confess
the
truth
to
him
.
<EOS>
here
would
be
a
rock
!
<EOS>
and
such
a
handsome
man
as
he
be
,
too
,
 
not
exactly
a
Corsair
,
as
he
be
great
in
authority
over
the
London
police
,
 
but
a
powerful
,
fine
fellow
,
who
would
know
what
to
do
with
sword
and
pistol
as
well
as
any
Corsair
;
 
and
one
,
too
,
no
doubt
,
who
would
understand
poetry
!
<EOS>
any
such
dream
,
however
,
be
altogether
unavaile
,
as
the
major
have
a
wife
at
home
and
seven
child
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
only
tell
me
what
to
do
,
I
will
do
it
,
"
she
say
,
look
up
into
his
face
with
entreaty
,
and
press
her
hand
together
in
supplication
.
  
<EOS>
then
at
great
length
,
and
with
much
patience
,
he
explain
to
her
what
he
would
have
her
do
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
,
if
she
be
summon
and
use
as
a
witness
,
there
would
be
no
attempt
to
prosecute
her
for
the
 
incorrect
version
 
of
which
she
have
undoubtedly
be
guilty
.
<EOS>
the
probability
be
,
that
she
would
receive
assurance
to
this
effect
before
she
would
be
ask
to
give
her
evidence
,
preparatory
to
the
committal
of
Benjamin
and
Smiler
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
assure
her
that
it
would
be
so
,
but
he
have
no
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
in
order
,
however
,
that
thing
may
be
make
to
run
as
smooth
as
possible
,
he
recommend
her
very
strongly
to
go
at
once
to
Mr.
Camperdown
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
the
whole
family
should
be
tell
,
"
say
the
major
,
"
and
it
will
be
well
for
you
that
they
should
know
it
from
yourself
than
from
us
.
<EOS>
"
when
she
hesitate
,
he
explain
to
her
that
the
matter
could
no
longer
be
keep
as
a
secret
,
and
that
her
evidence
would
certainly
appear
in
the
paper
.
<EOS>
He
propose
that
she
should
be
summon
for
that
day
week
,
 
which
would
be
the
Friday
after
Lucinda
's
marriage
,
and
he
suggest
that
she
should
go
to
Mr.
Camperdown
's
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
what
!
 
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Lizzie
,
in
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lady
Eustace
,
"
say
the
major
,
"
the
sooner
you
get
back
into
straight
running
,
the
sooner
you
will
be
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
she
promise
that
she
would
go
on
the
Tuesday
,
 
the
day
after
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
learn
it
in
the
meantime
,
you
must
not
be
surprised
,
"
say
the
major
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
one
thing
,
Major
Mackintosh
,
"
she
say
,
as
she
give
him
her
hand
at
parting
,
 
"
they
can
not
take
away
from
me
anything
that
be
my
own
;
 
can
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
they
can
,
"
say
the
major
,
escape
rather
quickly
from
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
do
It
"
 
<EOS>
the
Saturday
and
the
Sunday
Lizzie
pass
in
outward
tranquillity
,
though
doubtless
her
mind
be
greatly
disturb
.
<EOS>
She
say
nothing
of
what
have
pass
between
her
and
Major
Mackintosh
,
explain
that
his
visit
have
be
make
solely
with
the
object
of
inform
her
that
Mr.
Benjamin
be
to
be
send
home
from
Vienna
,
but
that
the
diamond
be
go
for
ever
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
as
she
declare
to
herself
,
agree
with
Major
Mackintosh
that
she
would
not
go
to
Mr.
Camperdown
till
the
Tuesday
,
 
justify
her
delay
by
her
solicitude
in
reference
to
Miss
Roanoke
's
marriage
;
and
therefore
these
two
day
be
her
own
.
<EOS>
after
them
would
come
a
totally
alter
phase
of
existence
.
<EOS>
all
the
world
would
know
the
history
of
the
diamond
,
 
cousin
Frank
,
and
Lord
Fawn
,
and
John
Eustace
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
the
Bobsborough
people
,
and
Lady
Glencora
,
and
that
old
vulturess
,
her
aunt
,
the
Countess
of
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
It
must
come
now
;
 
but
she
have
two
day
in
which
she
could
be
quiet
and
think
of
her
position
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
she
think
,
send
one
of
her
letter
to
Lord
Fawn
before
she
go
to
Mr.
Camperdown
;
 
but
which
should
she
send
?
<EOS>
or
should
she
write
a
third
explain
the
whole
matter
in
sweetly
piteous
feminine
term
,
and
swear
that
the
only
remain
feeling
in
her
bosom
be
a
devoted
affection
to
the
man
who
have
now
twice
promise
to
be
her
husband
?
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
the
preparation
for
the
great
marriage
go
on
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
spend
her
time
busily
between
Lucinda
's
bedchamber
and
the
banquet
hall
in
Albemarle
Street
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
pecuniary
difficulty
the
trousseau
be
to
be
a
wonder
;
and
even
Lizzie
be
astonish
at
the
jewellery
which
that
indefatigable
woman
have
collect
together
for
a
preliminary
show
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
She
have
spend
hour
at
Howell
and
James
's
,
and
have
make
marvellous
bargain
there
and
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
thing
be
send
for
selection
,
of
which
the
great
portion
be
to
be
return
,
but
all
be
keep
for
the
show
.
<EOS>
the
same
thing
which
be
show
to
separate
friend
in
Hertford
Street
as
part
of
the
trousseau
on
Friday
and
Saturday
be
carry
over
to
Albemarle
Street
on
the
Sunday
,
so
as
to
add
to
the
quasi
-
public
exhibition
of
present
on
the
Monday
.
<EOS>
the
money
expend
have
go
very
far
.
<EOS>
the
most
have
be
make
of
a
fail
credit
.
<EOS>
every
particle
of
friendly
generosity
have
be
so
manipulate
as
to
add
to
the
external
magnificence
.
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
do
all
this
without
any
help
from
Lucinda
,
 
in
the
midst
of
most
contemptuous
indifference
on
Lucinda
's
part
.
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
be
get
to
allow
the
milliner
to
fit
the
dress
to
her
body
,
and
positively
refuse
to
thrust
her
foot
into
certain
golden
-
heel
boot
with
brightly
-
bronze
toe
,
which
be
a
great
feature
among
the
raiment
.
<EOS>
nobody
know
it
except
Mrs.
Carbuncle
and
the
maid
,
 
even
Lizzie
Eustace
do
not
know
it
;
 
but
once
the
bride
absolutely
run
amuck
among
the
finery
,
scatter
the
lace
here
and
there
,
pitch
the
glove
-
box
under
the
bed
,
chuck
the
golden
-
heel
boot
into
the
fire
-
place
,
and
exhibit
quite
a
temp
of
fury
against
one
of
the
fine
show
of
petticoat
ever
arrange
with
a
view
to
the
admiration
and
envy
of
female
friend
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
Mrs.
Carbuncle
bore
,
and
still
persevere
.
<EOS>
the
thing
be
so
nearly
do
now
that
she
could
endure
to
persevere
though
the
provocation
to
abandon
it
be
so
great
.
<EOS>
She
have
even
cease
to
find
fault
with
her
niece
,
 
but
go
on
in
silence
count
the
hour
till
the
trouble
should
be
take
off
her
own
shoulder
and
place
on
those
of
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
thing
to
her
,
almost
more
than
she
have
expect
,
that
neither
Lucinda
nor
Sir
Griffin
should
have
positively
decline
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
either
should
retreat
from
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
luckily
for
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
Sir
Griffin
take
delight
in
the
show
.
<EOS>
He
do
this
after
a
bearish
fashion
,
put
his
finger
upon
little
flaw
with
an
intelligence
for
which
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
not
hitherto
<EOS>
give
him
credit
.
<EOS>
as
to
certain
ornament
,
he
observe
that
the
silver
be
plate
and
the
gold
ormolu
.
<EOS>
a
"
rope
"
of
pearl
he
at
once
detect
as
be
false
,
 
and
after
finger
certain
lace
he
turn
up
his
nose
and
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
then
,
on
the
Sunday
,
in
Albemarle
Street
,
he
point
out
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
sundry
article
which
he
have
see
in
the
bedroom
on
the
Saturday
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
Sir
Griffin
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
of
course
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
oh
;
 
that
be
of
course
,
be
it
?
"
say
Sir
Griffin
,
turn
up
his
nose
again
.
<EOS>
"
where
do
that
Delph
bowl
come
from
?
"
<EOS>
"
It
be
one
of
Mortlock
's
fine
etruscan
vase
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
 
I
think
that
etruscan
vase
come
from
 
from
somewhere
in
Greece
or
Italy
,
"
say
Sir
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
that
you
be
shocking
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
struggle
to
maintain
her
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
He
pass
hour
of
the
Sunday
in
Hertford
Street
,
and
Lord
George
also
be
there
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
who
could
hardly
devote
her
mind
to
the
affair
of
the
wedding
,
remain
alone
in
her
own
sitting
-
room
during
the
great
part
of
the
day
;
 
but
she
do
show
herself
while
Lord
George
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
hear
that
Mackintosh

say
Lord
George

<EOS>
"
yes

he
be
here

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

and
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
do
not
like
the
way
in
which
the
man
look
at
her
,
feel
it
to
be
not
only
unfriendly
,
but
absolutely
cruel
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
imply
that
he
know
that
her
secret
be
about
to
be
divulge
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
he
to
her
now
that
he
should
be
impertinent
to
her
?
<EOS>
what
he
know
,
all
the
world
would
know
before
the
end
of
the
week
.
<EOS>
and
that
other
man
who
know
it
already
,
have
be
kind
to
her
,
have
say
nothing
about
perjury
,
but
have
explain
to
her
that
what
she
would
have
to
bear
would
be
trouble

and
not
imprisonment
and
loss
of
money

civil

have
make
thing
look
bad

why

she
submit
to

question
by
Lord
George

<EOS>
in
a
day
or
two
the
secret
which
he
know

<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius

the
cause
of
their
absence
,
and

nothing
of
a
parson

anger
at

.
<EOS>
He

to
marry
the
couple
on
the
Monday
morning
,
and

on
the
Sunday
.
<EOS>
He

peculiarly
gracious
and

,
and

joyful
and
happy
in
their

<EOS>
to
Lizzie
he
be
almost
affectionate
,
and
Mrs.
Carbuncle

the
top
of
her
bent
.
<EOS>
the
power
of
the
man
in
be
sprightly
under
such
a
load
of
trouble
as
oppress
the
household
,
be
wonderful
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
do
with
three
woman
who
be
worldly
,
hard
,
and
give
entirely
to
evil
thing
.
<EOS>
even
as
regard
the
bride
,
who
feel
the
horror
of
her
position
,
so
much
must
be
in
truth
admit
.
<EOS>
though
from
day
to
day
and
hour
to
hour
she
would
openly
declare
her
hatred
of
the
thing
around
her
,
 
yet
she
go
on
.
<EOS>
since
she
have
enter
upon
life
she
have
know
nothing
but
falsehood
and
scheme
wickedness
;
 
and
,
though
she
rebel
against
the
consequence
,
she
have
not
rebel
against
the
wickedness
.
<EOS>
now
to
this
unfortunate
young
woman
and
her
two
companion
,
Mr.
Emilius
discourse
with
an
unctuous
mixture
of
celestial
and
terrestrial
glorification
,
which
be
proof
,
at
any
rate
,
of
great
ability
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
He
tell
them
how
a
good
wife
be
a
crown
,
or
rather
a
chaplet
of
aetherial
rose
to
her
husband
,
and
<EOS>
how
high
rank
and
great
station
in
the
world
make
such
a
chaplet
more
beautiful
and
more
valuable
.
<EOS>
His
work
in
the
vineyard
,
he
say
,
have
fall
lately
among
the
wealthy
and
nobly
bear
;
and
though
he
would
not
say
that
he
be
entitle
to
take
glory
on
that
account
,
still
he
give
thank
daily
in
that
he
have
be
enable
to
give
his
humble
assistance
towards
the
running
of
a
godly
life
to
those
who
,
by
their
example
,
be
enable
to
have
so
wide
an
effect
upon
their
poor
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
He
know
well
how
difficult
it
be
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
.
<EOS>
They
have
the
high
possible
authority
for
that
.
<EOS>
but
Scripture
never
say
that
the
camel
,
 
which
,
as
he
explain
it
,
be
simply
a
thread
large
than
ordinary
thread
,
 
could
not
go
through
the
needle
's
eye
.
<EOS>
the
camel
which
succeed
,
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
attend
its
exalted
position
,
would
be
peculiarly
bless
.
<EOS>
and
he
go
on
to
suggest
that
the
three
lady
before
him
,
one
of
whom
be
about
to
enter
upon
a
new
phase
of
life
to

under
auspex
peculiarly
propitious
,

all
of
them
,
camel
of
this
description
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
,
when
he
come
in
,
receive
for
a
while
the
peculiar
attention
of
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Sir
Griffin
,
"
he
commence
,
"
that
no
period
of
a
man
's
life
be
so
blessed
,
as
that
upon
which
you
will
enter
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
this
he
say
in
a
whisper
,
but
it
be
a
whisper
audible
to
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
yes
;
it
be
all
right
,
I
daresay
,
"
say
Sir
Griffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
after
all
,
what
be
life
till
a
man
have
meet
and
obtain
the
partner
of
his
soul
?
<EOS>
It
be
a
blank
,
 
and
the
blank
become
every
day
more
and
more
intolerable
to
the
miserable
solitary

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder

do
not
get

,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
who
perceive
that
Sir
Griffin
be
rather
astray
for
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
 
<EOS>
if
one
could
always
be
fortunate
when
one
love

"
say
Mr.
Emilius
,
cast
his
eye
across
to
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
to
them
all
that
he
do
not
wish
to
conceal
his
passion
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
object
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
that
the
lover
should
not
be
leave

together
,
but
that
they
should

the
moment
,
explain
to
him
what
would
be
the
extent
of
Lucinda
's
box
for
the
wedding
tour
,
and
assure
him
that
he
would
find
Lucinda
's
new
maid
a
treasure
in
regard
to
his
own
shirt
and
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
.
<EOS>
She
toil
marvellously
at
little
subject
,
always
make
some
allusion
to
Lucinda
,
and
never
hint
that
aught
short
of
Elysium
be
in
store
for
him
.
<EOS>
the
labour
be
great
;
the
task
be
terrible
;
but
now
it
be
so
nearly
over

<EOS>
and
to
Lizzie

be
very
courteous

by
a
word
or

look
that

<EOS>
Lucinda

"

"
say
Mrs.

,
with
her
good
good
humour
.
<EOS>
"
all

"
say
Sir
Griffin
as
he
pass
out
of
the

<EOS>
Lucinda
walk
across
the

be
now
really
frightened
.
<EOS>
what
would
be
say
of
her
if
she
should
press
the
marriage
forward
to
a
completion
,
and
if
after
that
some
terrible
tragedy
should
take
place
between
the
bride
and
bridegroom
?
<EOS>
that
Lucinda
,
in
spite
of
all
that
have
be
say
,
would
stand
at
the
altar
,
and
allow
the
ceremony
to
be
perform
,
she
still
believe
.
<EOS>
those
last
word
about
burn
paper
and
put
thing
away
,
seem
to
imply
that
the
girl
still
think
that
she
would
be
take
away
from
her
present
home
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
but
what
would
come
afterwards
?
<EOS>
the
horror
which
the
bride
express
be
,
as
Mrs.
Carbuncle
well
know
,
no
mock
feeling
,
no
pretence
at
antipathy
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
think
of
it
,
and
to
realise
what
may
in
truth
be
the
girl
's
action
and
ultimate
fate
when
she
should
find
herself
in
the
power
of
this
man
whom
she
so
hate
.
<EOS>
but
have
not
other
girl
do
the
same
thing
,
and
live
through
it
all
,
and
become
fat
,
indifferent
,
and
fond
of
the
world
?
<EOS>
It
be
only
the
first
step
that
signifie
.
  
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
the
thing
must
go
on
now
;
 
must
go
on
,
whatever
may
be
the
result
to
Lucinda
or
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
herself
.
<EOS>
yes
;
it
must
go
on
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
no
doubt
,
very
much
of
bitterness
in
the
world
for
such
as
them
,
 
for
person
doom
by
the
necessity
of
their
position
to
a
continual
struggle
.
<EOS>
It
always
have
be
so
,
and
always
would
be
so
.
<EOS>
but
each
bitter
cup
must
be
drain
in
the
hope
that
the
next
may
be
sweet
.
<EOS>
of
course
the
marriage
must
go
on
;
though
,
doubtless
,
this
cup
be
very
bitter
.
  
<EOS>
More
than
once
in
the
night
Mrs.
Carbuncle
creep
up
to
the
door
of
her
niece
's
room
,
endeavour
to
ascertain
what
may
be
go
on
within
.
<EOS>
at
two
o'clock
,
while
she
be
on
the
landing
-
place
,
the
candle
be
extinguish
,
and
she
could
hear
that
Lucinda
put
herself
to
bed
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
so
far
,
thing
be
safe
.
<EOS>
an
indistinct
,
incompleted
idea
of
some
possible
tragedy
have
flit
across
the
mind
of
the
poor
woman
,
cause
her
to
shake
and
tremble
,
forbid
her
,
weary
as
she
be
,
to
lie
down
;
 
but
now
she
tell
herself
at
last
that
this
be
an
idle
phantasy
,
and
she
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
of
course
Lucinda
must
go
through
with
it
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
her
own
doing
,
and
Sir
Griffin
be
not
bad
than
other
man
.
<EOS>
as
she
say
this
to
herself
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
harden
her
heart
by
remember
that
her
own
married
life
have
not
be
peculiarly
happy
.
  
<EOS>
exactly
at
eight
on
the
follow
morning
she
knock
at
her
niece
's
door
,
and
be
at
once
bid
to
enter
.
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
Aunt
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
the
word
cheer
her
wonderfully
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
there
have
be
no
tragedy
as
yet
,
and
as
she
turn
the
handle
of
the
door
,
she
feel
that
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
the
marriage
would
go
on
just
like
any
other
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
find
Lucinda
up
and
dress
,
 
but
so
dressed
as
certainly
to
show
no
preparation
for
a
wedding
-
toilet
.
<EOS>
She
have
on
an
ordinary
stuff
morning
frock
,
and
her
hair
be
close
tuck
up
and
pin
,
<EOS>
as
it
may
have
be
have
she
already
prepare
herself
for
a
journey
.
<EOS>
but
what
astonish
Mrs.
Carbuncle
more
than
the
dress
be
the
girl
's
manner
.
<EOS>
She
be
sit
at
a
table
with
a
book
before
her
,
which
be
afterwards
find
to
be
the
Bible
,
and
she
never
turn
her
head
as
her
aunt

the
room
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
  
"

<EOS>
I

ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
how
be
I
to
lie
in
bed
on
such
a
morning
as
this
?
<EOS>
Aunt
Jane
,
I
wish
you
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
that
no

<EOS>
and
she
be
in

,
 
quite
in
earnest
,
though
there
be
a
flightiness
about
her
manner
which
induce
Mrs.
Carbuncle
for
awhile
to
think
that
she
be
less
so
than
she
have
be
on
the
previous
evening
.
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
woman
remain
with
her

when

first
one
maid
and
then
another
,
they
be
refuse

.
<EOS>
It
may
still
be
possible
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
think
,
that
she
would
prevail
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
now
could
shake
Lucinda
or
induce
her
even
to
discuss
the
subject
.
<EOS>
She
sit
there
look
steadfastly
at
the
book
,
 
hardly
answer
,
never
defend
herself
,
but
protest
that
nothing
should
induce
her
to
leave
the
room
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
"
do

<EOS>
Mrs.

They

She

at
first
he
see
Lizzie
Eustace
,
upon
whom
the
misfortune
of
the
day
have
have
a
most
depressing
effect
.
<EOS>
the
wedding
be
to
have
be
the
one
morsel
of
pleasing
excitement
which
would
come
before
she
undergo
the
humble
penance
to
which
she
be
doom
.
<EOS>
that
be
frustrate
and
abandon

and
now

I

You

more

do
she

<EOS>
there
sit
the
unfortunate
girl

<EOS>
there
have
come
over
her
face
a
look
of
fixed

almost
idiotic
resolution
;
her
mouth
be
compress

she

twiddle
her

She

and
have
long
cease
to

violent
when
question

<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless

she
be
firm
enough
when

It

what

They

very
cruel

"
She
would
not

you
have
tell

not

<EOS>
but
you
will
not
bring
him
again
;
 
will
you
?
"
  
"
certainly
not

<EOS>
He
mean
to
go
abroad

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
 
yes
;
that
will
be
good

<EOS>
let

<EOS>
He
know
it
all
the

that
I

<EOS>
why
do
he
want
me
to
be
his

<EOS>
if
he
have
go
abroad

I
will
go
down

stair
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
go
out

the
house

<EOS>
nothing
shall
make
me
go
out

the
house

<EOS>
be
the
bridesmaid
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
long
ago
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
piteously
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
go
down
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
between
them
,
they
lead
her
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
belief
,
"
say
Lord
George
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
some
minute
afterwards
,
"
that
you
have
drive
her
mad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
to
turn
against
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
true
.
<EOS>
how
you
have
have
the
heart
to
go
on
press
it
upon
her
,
I
could
never
understand
.
<EOS>
I
be
about
as
hard
as
a
milestone
,
but
I
will
be
shoot
if
I
could
have
do
it
.
<EOS>
from
day
to
day
I
think
that
you
would
have
give
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
so
like
a
man
,
 
when
it
be
all
over
,
to
turn
upon
a
woman
and
say
that
she
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
do
it
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
do
,
and
that
you
take
a
great
deal
of
pride
in
the
doing
of
it
.
<EOS>
when
you
make
him
offer
to
her
down
in
Scotland
,
and
make
her
accept
him
,
you
be
so
proud
that
you
could
hardly
hold
yourself
.
<EOS>
what
will
you
do
now
?
<EOS>
go
on
just
as
though
nothing
have
happen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
we
shall
do
.
<EOS>
there
will
be
so
many
thing
to
be
pay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
there
would
,
 
and
you
can
hardly
expect
Sir
Griffin
to
pay
for
them
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
take
her
away
somewhere
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
that
she
can
not
remain
here
.
<EOS>
and
that
other
woman
will
be
in
prison
before
the
week
's
over
,
I
should
say
,
 
unless
she
run
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
of
comfort
to
be
obtain
by
any
of
them
from
Lord
George
,
who
be
quite
as
harsh
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
as
he
have
be
to
Lizzie
Eustace
.
<EOS>
He
remain
in
Hertford
Street
for
an
hour
,
and
then
take
his
leave
,
say
that
he
think
that
he
also
should
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
anything
could
have
hurt
my
character
much
;
but
,
upon
my
word
,
between
you
and
Lady
Eustace
,
I
begin
to
find
that
in
every
deep
there
may
be
a
low
depth
.
<EOS>
all
the
town
have
give
me
credit
for
steal
her
ladyship
's
necklace
,
and
now
I
shall
be
mix
up
in
this
mock
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
Rooper
be
to
send
his
bill
in
to
me
,
"
 
Mr.
Rooper
be
the
keeper
of
the
hotel
in
Albemarle
Street
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
follow
Sir
Griffin
abroad
.
<EOS>
You
have
make
England
too
hot
to
hold
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
he
leave
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
of
that
day
be
a
terrible
time
to
the
three
lady
in
Hertford
Street
,
 
and
the
follow
day
be
almost
bad
.
<EOS>
nobody
come
to
see
them
,
and
not
one
of
them
dare
to
speak
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
for
the
third
day
,
the
Wednesday
,
Lady
Eustace
have
make
her
appointment
with
Mr.
Camperdown
,
have
write
to
the
attorney
,
in
compliance
with
the
pressing
advice
of
Major
Mackintosh
,
to
name
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
have
write
again
,
send
his
compliment
,
and
say
that
he
would
receive
Lady
Eustace
at
the
time
fix
by
her
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
this
interview
be
very
bad
,
but
even
this
be
hardly
so
oppressive
as
the
actual
exist
wretchedness
of
that
house
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
whom
Lizzie
have
always
know
as
high
-
spirited
,
bold
,
and
almost
domineering
,
be
altogether
prostrate
by
her
misfortune
.
<EOS>
She
be
querulous
,
lachrymose
,
and
utterly
despondent
.
<EOS>
from
what
Lizzie
now
learn
,
her
hostess
be
envelop
in
a
mass
of
debt
which
would
have
be
hopeless
,
even
have
Lucinda
go
off
as
a
bride
;
but
she
have
be
willing
to
face
all
that
with
the
object
of
establish
her
niece
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
expect
nothing
from
the
marriage
for
herself
.
<EOS>
She
well
know
that
Sir
Griffin
would
neither
pay
her
debt
nor
give
her
a
home
nor
lend
her
money
.
<EOS>
but
to
have
marry
the
girl
who
be
in
her
charge
would
have
be
in
itself
a
success
,
and
would
have
in
some
sort
repay
her
for
her
trouble
.
<EOS>
there
would
have
be
something
leave
to
show
for
her
expenditure
of
time
and
money
.
<EOS>
but
now
there
be
nothing
around
her
but
failure
and
dismay
.
<EOS>
the
very
servant
in
the
house
seem
to
know
that
ordinary
respect
be
hardly
demand
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
Lucinda
,
Lizzie
feel
,
from
the
very
hour
in
which
she
first
see
her
on
the
morning
of
the
intend
wedding
,
that
her
mind
be
astray
.
<EOS>
She
insist
on
pass
the
time
up
in
her
own
room
,
and
always
sit
with
the
Bible
before
her
.
<EOS>
at
every
knock
at
the
door
,
or
re
at
the
bell
,
she
would
look
round
suspiciously
,
and
once
she
whisper
into
Lizzie
's
ear
that
if
ever
"
he
"
should
come
there
again
<EOS>
she
would
"
give
him
a
kiss
with
a
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"
on
the
Tuesday
,
Lizzie
recommend
Mrs.
Carbuncle
to
get
medical
advice
,
 
and
at
last
they
send
for
Mr.
Emilius
that
they
may
ask
counsel
of
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
be
full
of
smile
and
consolation
,
and
still
allow
his
golden
hope
as
to
some
elysian
future
to
crop
out
;
 
but
he
do
acknowledge
at
last
,
in
a
whisper
conference
with
Lady
Eustace
,
that
somebody
ought
to
see
Miss
Roanoke
.
<EOS>
somebody
do
see
Miss
Roanoke
,
 
and
the
doctor
who
be
thus
appeal
to
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Miss
Roanoke
have
better
be
take
into
the
country
for
a
little
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lady
Eustace
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
now
you
can
be
a
friend
indeed
,
"
 
<EOS>
meaning
,
of
course
,
that
an
invitation
to
Portray
Castle
would
do
more
than
could
anything
else
towards
make
straight
the
crooked
thing
of
the
hour
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
when
she
make
the
request
,
of
course
know
of
Lizzie
's
come
trouble
;
 
but
let
them
do
what
they
could
to
Lizzie
,
they
could
not
take
away
her
house
.
  
<EOS>
but
Lizzie
feel
at
once
that
this
would
not
suit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
the
condition
which
I
be
in
myself
!
"
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
threaten
with
the
Treadmill
 
<EOS>
early
on
the
Wednesday
morning
,
two
or
three
hour
before
the
time
fix
for
Lizzie
's
visit
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
her
cousin
Frank
come
to
call
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
presume
him
to
be
altogether
ignorant
of
all
that
Major
Mackintosh
have
know
,
and
therefore
endeavour
to
receive
him
as
though
her
heart
be
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frank
,
"
she
say
,
"
you
have
hear
of
our
terrible
misfortune
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
so
much
,
"
say
he
gravely
,
"
that
I
hardly
know
what
to
believe
and
what
not
to
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
about
Miss
Roanoke
's
marriage
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
 
I
have
be
tell
that
it
be
break
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
Lizzie
,
with
affected
eagerness
,
give
him
a
description
of
the
whole
affair
,
declare
how
horrible
,
how
tragic
,
the
thing
have
be
from
its
very
commencement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
,
Frank
,
down
at
Portray
,
they
never
really
care
for
each
other
?
<EOS>
They
become
engage
the
very
time
you
be
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
forget
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
Lucinda
Roanoke
do
not
understand
what
real
love
mean
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
teach
herself
to
comprehend
what
be
the
very
essence
of
love
;
 
and
as
for
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
though
he
be
anxious
to
marry
her
,
he
never
have
any
idea
of
love
at
all
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
always
feel
that
,
Frank
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
you
have
have
so
much
to
do
with
them
,
Lizzie

there
be
no

Frank

and
,
as
for
that
,
I
do
not
suppose
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
can
do
me
any
harm
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
a
baronet
,
and
the
marriage
would
have
be
respectable
.
<EOS>
Miss
Roanoke
have
be
eccentric
,
and
that
have
be
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
what
will
be
do
,
Frank
,
with
all
the
present
that
be
buy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
an
idea
.
<EOS>
They
would
better
be
sell
to
pay
the
bill
.
<EOS>
but
I
come
to
you
,
Lizzie
,
about
another
piece
of
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
piece
of
business
?
"
she
ask
,
look
him
in
the
face
for
a
moment
,
try
to
be
bold
,
but
tremble
as
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
believe
him
to
be
ignorant
of
her
story
,
but
she
have
soon
perceive
,
from
his
manner
to
her
,
that
he
know
it
all
,
 
or
,
at
least
,
that
he
know
so
much
that
she
would
have
to
tell
him
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
longer
any
secret
with
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
there
could
be
no
longer
any
secret
with
anybody
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
prepare
to
encounter
a
world
accurately
inform
as
to
every
detail
of
the
business
which
,
for
the
last
three
month
,
have
be
to
her
a
burden
<EOS>
so
oppressive
that
,
at
some
period
,
she
have
sink
altogether
under
the
weight
.
<EOS>
She
have
already
endeavour
to
realise
her
position
,
and
to
make
clear
to
herself
the
condition
of
her
future
life
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
have
talk
to
her
of
perjury
and
prison
,
and
have
try
to
frighten
her
by
make
the
very
bad
of
her
fault
.
<EOS>
accord
to
him
she
would
certainly
be
make
to
pay
for
the
diamond
,
and
would
be
enable
to
do
so
by
save
her
income
during
a
long
term
of
incarceration
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
terrible
prospect
of
thing
;
 
and
she
have
almost
believe
in
it
.
<EOS>
then
the
major
have
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
major
,
she
think
,
be
the
true
gentleman
she
have
ever
see
,
and
her
good
friend
.
<EOS>
ah
;
 
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
wife
and
seven
child
,
there
may
still
have
be
comfort
!
<EOS>
that
which
have
be
perjury
with
Lord
George
,
have
by
the
major
be
so
simply
,
and
yet
so
correctly
,
call
an
incorrect
version
of
fact
!
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
,
 
and
no
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
in
defend
herself
to
herself
,
feel
that
,
though
cruel
magistrate
and
hard
-
hearted
lawyer
and
pig
-
head
juryman
may
call
her
little
fault
by
the
name
of
perjury
,
it
could
not
be
real
,
wicked
perjury
,
because
the
diamond
have
be
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
have
defraud
nobody
,
 
have
wish
to
defraud
nobody
,
 
if
only
the
people
would
have
leave
her
alone
.
<EOS>
It
have
suit
her
to
give
 
an
incorrect
version
of
fact
,
because
people
have
trouble
themselves
about
her
affair
;
and
now
all
this
have
come
upon
her
!
<EOS>
the
major
have
comfort
her
very
greatly
;
but
still
,
 
what
would
the
world
say
?
<EOS>
even
he
,
kind
and
comfortable
as
he
have
be
,
have
make
her
understand
that
she
must
go
into
court
and
confess
the
incorrectness
of
her
own
version
.
<EOS>
She
believe
every
word
the
major
say
.
<EOS>
ah
,
there
be
a
man
worthy
to
be
believe
;
 
a
man
of
man
!
<EOS>
They
could
not
take
away
her
income
or
her
castle
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
make
her
pay
for
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
but
still
,
 
what
would
the
world
say
?
<EOS>
and
what
would
her
lover
say
?
<EOS>
what
one
of
her
lover
think
proper
to
say
,
she
have
already
hear
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
have
speak
out
,
and
have
make
himself
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
she
know
,
would
withdraw
the
renewal
of
his
offer
,
let
her
answer
to
him
be
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
but
what
would
Frank
say
?
<EOS>
and
now
Frank
be
with
her
,
look
into
her
face
with
severe
eye
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
more
than
ever
convince
that
the
life
of
a
widow
be
not
suit
for
her
,
and
that
,
among
her
several
lover
,
she
must
settle
her
wealth
and
her
heart
upon
some
special
lover
.
<EOS>
neither
her
wealth
nor
her
heart
would
be
in
any
way
injure
by
the
confession
which
she
be
prepared
to
make
.
<EOS>
but
then
man
be
so
timid
,
so
false
,
and
so
blind
!
<EOS>
in
regard
to
Frank
,
whom
she
now
believe
that
she
have
love
with
all
the
warmth
of
her
young
affection
from
the
first
moment
in
which
she
have
see
him
after
Sir
Florian
's
death
,
 
she
have
be
at
great
trouble
to
clear
the
way
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
know
of
his
silly
engagement
to
Lucy
Morris
,
and
be
willing
to
forgive
him
that
offence
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
he
could
not
marry
Lucy
,
because
of
her
pennilessness
and
his
indebtedness
;
and
therefore
she
have
take
the
trouble
to
see
Lucy
with
the
view
of
make
thing
straight
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
Lucy
have
,
of
course
,
be
rough
with
her
,
and
ill
-
mannered
,
but
Lizzie
think
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
she
have
succeed
.
<EOS>
Lucy
be
rough
and
ill
-
mannered
,
but
be
,
at
the
same
time
,
what
the
world
call
good
,
and
would
hardly
persevere
after
what
have
be
say
to
her
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
sure
that
,
a
month
since
,
her
cousin
would
have
yield
himself
to
her
willingly
,
if
he
could
only
have
free
himself
from
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
just
in
this
very
nick
of
time
,
which
be
so
momentous
to
her
,
the
police
have
succeed
in
unravel
her
secret
,
and
there
sit
Frank
,
look
at
her
with
stern
,
ill
-
natured
eye
,
like
an
enemy
rather
than
a
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
piece
of
business
?
"
she
ask
,
in
answer
to
his
question
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
bold
,
 
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
She
must
brazen
it
out
with
him
,
if
only
she
could
be
strong
enough
to
put
on
her
brass
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
so
stupidly
chivalrous
in
believe
all
her
story
about
the
robbery
when
nobody
else
have
quite
believe
them
,
that
she
feel
that
she
have
before
her
a
task
that
be
very
disagreeable
and
very
difficult
.
<EOS>
She
look
up
at
him
,
struggle
to
be
bold
,
and
then
her
glance
sink
before
his
gaze
and
fall
upon
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
at
all
wish
to
pry
into
your
secret
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
secret
from
him
!
<EOS>
some
such
exclamation
be
on
her
lip
,
when
she
remember
that
her
special
business
,
at
the
present
moment
,
be
to
acknowledge
a
secret
which
have
be
keep
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
unkind
of
you
to
speak
to
me
in
that
way
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
to
pry
into
your
secret
.
<EOS>
but
I
hear
rumour
which
seem
to
be
substantiate
;
and
though
,
of
course
,
I
could
stay
away
from
you
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
,
 
whatever
happen
,
pray
,
pray
do
not
stay
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
where
be
I
to
look
for
advice
if
you
stay
away
from
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
,
Lizzie
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
if
you
desert
me
,
I
be
undone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
of
course
,
true
that
some
of
the
police
have
be
with
you
lately
?
"
  
"
Major
Mackintosh
be
here
,
about
the
end
of
last
week
,
 
a
most
kind
man
,
altogether
a
gentleman
,
and
I
be
so
glad
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
make
him
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
make
him
come
?
"
how
should
she
tell
her
story
?
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
come
,
of
course
,
about
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
They
have
find
out
everything
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
jeweller
,
Benjamin
,
who
concoct
it
all
.
<EOS>
that
horrid
sly
girl
<EOS>
I
have
,
Patience
Crabstick
,
put
him
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
two
regular
housebreaker
.
<EOS>
They
have
find
it
all
out
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
Major
Mackintosh
come
to
tell
me
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
diamond
be
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
;
 
those
weary
,
weary
diamond
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
Frank
,
that
,
though
they
be
my
own
,
as
much
as
the
coat
you
wear
be
your
own
,
I
be
glad
they
be
go
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
that
the
police
have
not
find
them
.
<EOS>
They
torment
me
so
that
I
hate
them
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
that
I
tell
you
how
I
long
to
throw
them
into
the
sea
,
and
to
be
rid
of
them
for
ever
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
of
course
,
be
a
joke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
joke
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
It
be
solemn
,
serious
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
want
to
know
be
,
 
where
be
they
steal
?
"
  
<EOS>
that
,
of
course
,
be
the
question
which
hitherto
Lizzie
Eustace
have
answer
by
an
incorrect
version
of
fact
,
and
now
she
must
give
the
true
version
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
put
a
bold
face
upon
it
,
but
it
be
very
difficult
.
<EOS>
a
face
bold
with
brass
<EOS>
she
could
not
assume
.
<EOS>
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
acting
may
serve
her
turn
,
and
a
face
that
should
be
tender
rather
than
bold
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Frank
!
"
she
exclaim
,
burst
out
into
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
suppose
that
they
be
take
at
Carlisle
,
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
fall
on
her
knee
,
at
his
foot
,
with
her
hand
clasp
together
,
and
her
one
long
lock
of
hair
hang
down
so
as
to
touch
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
bright
with
tear
,
but
be
not
,
as
yet
,
wet
and
red
with
weeping
.
<EOS>
be
not
this
confession
enough
?
<EOS>
be
he
so
hard
-
hearted
as
to
make
her
tell
her
own
disgrace
in
spoken
word
?
<EOS>
of
course
he
know
,
well
enough
,
now
,
when
the
diamond
have
be
steal
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
possess
of
any
tenderness
,
any
tact
,
any
manliness
,
he
would
go
on
,
presume
that
question
to
have
be
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
quite
understand
it
all
,
"
he
say
,
lay
his
hand
softly
upon
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
lead
to
make
so
many
statement
to
other
people
,
which
now
seem
to
have
be
 
incorrect
!
<EOS>
It
be
only
the
box
that
be
take
at
Carlisle
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
only
the
box
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
answer
that
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
thief
think
that
the
diamond
be
in
the
box
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
do
not
cross
-
question
me
about
it
.
<EOS>
if
you
could
know
what
I
have
suffer
,
you
would
not
punish
me
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
to
go
to
Mr.
Camperdown
be
this
very
day
.
<EOS>
I
offer
to
do
that
at
once
,
and
I
sha'n't
have
strength
to
go
through
it
if
you
be
not
kind
to
me
now
.
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
Frank
,
 
do
be
kind
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
he
be
kind
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
lift
her
up
to
the
sofa
and
do
not
ask
her
another
question
about
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
have
lie
to
him
and
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
from
the
very
commencement
of
his
intimacy
with
her
,
he
have
know
that
she
be
a
liar
,
and
what
else
could
he
have
expect
but
lie
?
<EOS>
as
it
happen
,
this
particular
lie
have
be
very
big
,
very
efficacious
,
and
the
cause
of
boundless
trouble
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
wholly
unnecessary
,
and
,
from
the
first
,
though
injurious
to
many
,
more
injurious
to
her
than
to
any
other
.
<EOS>
He
himself
have
be
injure
,
but
it
seem
to
him
now
that
she
have
absolutely
ruin
herself
.
<EOS>
and
all
this
have
be
do
for
nothing
,
 
have
be
do
,
as
he
think
,
that
Mr.
Camperdown
may
be
keep
in
the
dark
,
whereas
all
the
light
in
the
world
would
have
assist
Mr.
Camperdown
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
bring
to
mind
,
as
he
stand
over
her
,
all
those
scene
which
she
have
so
successfully
perform
in
his
presence
since
she
have
come
to
London
,
 
scene
in
which
the
robbery
in
Carlisle
have
be
discuss
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
on
these
occasion
freely
express
her
opinion
about
the
necklace
,
say
,
in
a
low
whisper
,
with
a
pretty
little
shrug
of
her
shoulder
,
that
she
presume
it
to
be
impossible
that
Lord
George
should
have
be
concern
in
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
feel
,
as
she
say
so
,
that
some
suspicion
be
intend
by
her
to
be
attach
to
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
She
have
wonder
whether
Mr.
Camperdown
have
know
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
hope
that
Lord
Fawn
would
now
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
quite
convinced
that
Mr.
Benjamin
have
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
indignant
that
the
police
have
not
trace
the
property
.
<EOS>
She
have
ask
in
another
whisper
,
 
a
very
low
whisper
indeed
,
 
whether
it
be
possible
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
should
know
more
about
it
than
she
be
pleased
to
tell
?
<EOS>
and
all
the
while
the
necklace
have
be
lie
in
her
own
desk
,
and
she
have
put
it
there
with
her
own
hand
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
marvellous
to
him
that
the
woman
could
have
be
so
false
and
have
sustain
her
falsehood
so
well
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
his
cousin
,
his
well
-
beloved
,
 
as
a
cousin
,
certainly
well
-
beloved
;
and
there
have
,
doubtless
,
be
time
in
which
he
have
think
that
he
would
make
her
his
wife
!
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
smile
as
he
stand
look
at
her
,
contemplate
all
the
confusion
which
she
have
cause
,
and
think
how
very
little
the
disclosure
of
her
iniquity
seem
to
confound
herself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Frank
,
do
not
laugh
at
me
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
laugh
,
Lizzie
;
I
be
only
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
Frank
,
what
have
I
better
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
 
that
be
difficult
;
be
it
not
?
<EOS>
You
see
I
hardly
know
all
the
truth
yet
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
know
more
,
 
but
how
can
I
advise
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
know
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
anybody
can
do
anything
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Major
Mackintosh
say
that
nobody
can
.
<EOS>
He
quite
understand
that
they
be
my
own
property
,
and
that
I
have
a
right
to
keep
them
in
my
desk
if
I
please
.
<EOS>
why
be
I
to
tell
everybody
where
they
be
?
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
foolish
,
and
now
they
be
lose
.
<EOS>
It
be
I
that
have
suffer
.
<EOS>
Major
Mackintosh
quite
understand
that
,
and
say
that
nobody
can
do
anything
to
me
;
 
only
I
must
go
to
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
will
have
to
be
examine
again
before
a
magistrate
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
suppose
I
must
be
examine
.
<EOS>
You
will
go
with
me
,
Frank
,
 
will
not
you
?
"
<EOS>
He
wince
,
and
make
no
immediate
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
but
before
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
Will
it
be
in
a
court
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
gentleman
come
here
before
.
<EOS>
Could
not
he
come
here
again
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
he
explain
to
her
the
difference
of
her
present
position
,
and
in
do
so
he
do
say
something
of
her
iniquity
.
<EOS>
He
make
her
understand
that
the
magistrate
have
go
out
of
his
way
at
the
last
inquiry
,
believe
her
to
be
a
lady
who
have
be
grievously
wrong
,
and
one
,
therefore
,
to
whom
much
consideration
be
due
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
have
be
grievously
wrong
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
but
now
she
would
be
require
to
tell
the
truth
in
opposition
to
the
false
evidence
which
she
have
formerly
give
;
and
she
would
herself
be
exempt
from
prosecution
for
perjury
only
on
the
ground
that
she
would
be
call
on
to
criminate
herself
in
give
evidence
against
criminal
whose
crime
have
be
deep
than
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
can
not
quite
eat
me
,
"
she
say
,
smile
through
her
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
they
will
not
eat
you
,
"
he
reply
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
go
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
suppose
I
have
better
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
 
that
will
be
so
nice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
idea
of
the
scene
at
the
police
-
court
be
not
at
all
"
nice
"
to
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
mind
what
they
say
to
me
as
long
as
you
be
by
my
side
.
<EOS>
everybody
will
know
that
they
be
my
own
,
 
will
not
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
there
will
be
the
trial
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
another
trial
?
"
<EOS>
then
he
explain
to
her
the
course
of
affair
,
 
that
the
man
may
not
improbably
be
try
at
Carlisle
for
steal
the
box
,
and
again
in
London
for
steal
the
diamond
,
 
that
two
distinct
act
of
burglary
have
be
commit
,
and
that
her
evidence
would
be
require
on
both
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
tell
her
also
that
her
attendance
before
the
magistrate
on
Friday
would
only
be
a
preliminary
ceremony
,
and
that
,
before
the
thing
be
over
she
would
,
doubtless
,
be
doom
to
bear
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
,
and
to
answer
very
many
disagreeable
question
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
care
for
nothing
if
you
will
only
be
at
my
side
,
"
she
exclaim
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
very
urgent
with
her
to
go
to
Scotland
as
soon
as
her
examination
before
the
magistrate
should
be
over
,
and
be
much
astonish
at
the
excuse
she
make
for
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
borrow
all
her
ready
money
;
but
as
she
be
now
in
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
house
,
she
could
repay
herself
a
portion
of
the
loan
by
remain
there
and
eat
it
out
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
exactly
say
how
much
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
borrow
,
but
she
leave
an
impression
on
Frank
's
mind
that
it
be
about
ten
time
the
actual
sum
.
<EOS>
with
this
excuse
he
be
not
satisfied
,
and
tell
her
that
she
must
go
to
Scotland
,
if
only
for
the
sake
of
escape
from
the
Carbuncle
connexion
.
<EOS>
She
promise
to
obey
him
if
he
would
be
her
convoy
.
<EOS>
the
Easter
holiday
be
just
now
at
hand
,
and
he
could
not
refuse
on
the
plea
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frank
,
do
not
refuse
me
this
;
 
only
think
how
terribly
forlorn
be
my
position
!
"
<EOS>
He
do
not
refuse
,
but
he
do
not
quite
promise
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
tender
-
hearted
towards
her
in
spite
of
her
enormity
.
<EOS>
one
iniquity
,
 
perhaps
her
bad
iniquity
,
he
do
not
yet
know
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
as
yet
hear
of
her
disinterested
appeal
to
Lucy
Morris
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
leave
her
she
be
almost
joyous
for
a
few
minute
;
 
till
the
thought
of
her
come
interview
with
Mr.
Camperdown
again
overshadow
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
dread
two
thing
chiefly
,
 
her
first
interview
with
her
cousin
Frank
after
he
should
have
learn
the
truth
,
and
those
peril
in
regard
to
perjury
with
which
Lord
George
have
threaten
her
.
<EOS>
both
these
bugbear
have
now
vanish
.
<EOS>
that
dear
man
,
the
major
,
have
tell
her
that
there
would
be
no
such
peril
,
and
her
cousin
Frank
have
not
seem
to
think
so
very
much
of
her
lie
and
treachery
!
<EOS>
He
have
still
be
affectionate
with
her
;
he
would
support
her
before
the
magistrate
,
and
would
travel
with
her
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
and
after
that
who
could
tell
what
may
come
next
?
<EOS>
how
foolish
she
have
be
to
trouble
herself
as
she
have
do
,
 
almost
to
choke
herself
with
an
agony
of
fear
,
because
she
have
fear
detection
.
<EOS>
now
she
be
detect
;
 
and
what
have
come
of
it
?
<EOS>
that
great
officer
of
justice
,
Major
Mackintosh
,
have
be
almost
more
than
civil
to
her
;
and
her
dear
cousin
Frank
be
still
a
cousin
,
 
dear
as
ever
.
<EOS>
People
,
after
all
,
do
not
think
so
very
much
of
perjury
,
 
of
perjury
such
as
her
,
commit
in
regard
to
one
's
own
property
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
odious
Lord
George
who
have
frighten
her
,
instead
of
comfort
,
as
he
would
have
do
<EOS>
have
there
be
a
spark
of
the
true
Corsair
poetry
about
him
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
feel
comfortably
confident
as
to
what
may
be
say
of
her
by
Lady
Glencora
and
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
but
she
be
almost
inclined
to
think
that
Lady
Glencora
would
support
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
no
poor
,
mealy
-
mouthed
thing
,
but
a
woman
of
the
world
who
understand
what
be
what
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
no
doubt
wish
that
the
trial
and
examination
be
over
;
 
but
her
money
be
safe
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
take
away
Portray
,
nor
could
they
rob
her
of
four
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
rest
,
she
could
live
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
order
the
carriage
to
take
her
to
Mr.
Camperdown
's
chamber
,
and
now
she
dress
herself
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
be
make
to
think
,
at
any
rate
by
her
outside
appearance
,
that
she
be
ashamed
of
herself
.
<EOS>
but
before
she
start
she
have
just
a
word
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
go
down
to
Scotland
on
Saturday
,
"
she
say
,
proclaim
her
news
not
in
the
most
gracious
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
if
they
let
you
go
,
"
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
who
be
to
prevent
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
police
.
<EOS>
I
know
all
about
it
,
Lady
Eustace
,
and
you
need
not
look
like
that
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
inform
me
that
you
will
probably
 
be
lock
up
to
-
day
or
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lord
George
be
a
story
-
teller
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
he
ever
say
so
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
do
,
he
know
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
ought
to
know
,
consider
all
that
you
have
make
him
suffer
.
<EOS>
that
you
should
have
go
on
,
with
the
necklace
in
your
own
box
all
the
time
,
let
people
think
that
he
have
take
it
,
and
accept
his
attention
all
the
while
,
be
what
I
can
not
understand
!
<EOS>
and
however
you
be
able
to
look
those
people
at
Carlisle
in
the
face
,
pass
me
!
<EOS>
of
course
,
Lady
Eustace
,
you
can
not
stay
here
after
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
stay
just
as
long
as
I
like
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
dear
Lucinda
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
that
she
should
be
drive
beyond
herself
by
so
horrible
a
story
.
<EOS>
the
feeling
that
she
have
be
live
all
this
time
in
the
same
house
with
a
woman
who
have
deceive
all
the
police
,
 
all
the
police
,
 
have
be
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
have
be
almost
too
much
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
yet
,
as
Lizzie
at
once
understand
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
know
nothing
now
which
she
have
not
know
when
she
make
her
petition
to
be
take
to
Portray
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
woman
,
too
,
who
have
borrow
her
money
last
week
,
whom
she
have
entertain
for
month
at
Portray
,
and
who
have
pretend
to
be
her
bosom
-
friend

<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
right
in
get
off
to
Scotland
as
soon
as
possible

if
they
will
let
you
go

"
continue
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
could
not
stay
here
.
<EOS>
up
to
Friday
night
it
can
be
permit
;
but
the
servant
have
better
wait
upon
you
in
your
own
room

<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
talk
to
me
in
that
way

scream
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
a
woman

say
Mrs.

hold
up
both
her

grief
,
<EOS>

nothing

bad

possibly
be
say
to
her

<EOS>
You
be
amenable
to
the
outraged
law

it
be
my
belief
that
they
can
keep
you
upon
the
treadmill
and
bread
and
water
for
month
and
month
,
 
if
not
for
year

"
<EOS>
have
pronounce
this
terrible
sentence
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
stalk
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
that
they
can
sequester
your
property
for
your
creditor
,
I
know
,
"
she
say
,
return
for
a
moment
and
put
her
head
within
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
the
carriage
be
ready
,
and
it
be
time
for
Lizzie
to
start
if
she
intend
to
keep
her
appointment
with
Mr.
Camperdown
.
<EOS>
She
be
much
fluster
and
weaken
by
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
ill
-
usage
,
and
have
difficulty
in
restrain
herself
from
tear
.
<EOS>
and
yet
what
the
woman
have
say
be
false
from
begin
to
end
.
<EOS>
the
maid
,
who
be
the
successor
of
Patience
Crabstick
,
be
to
accompany
her
;
and
,
as
she
pass
through
the
hall
,
she
so
far
recover
herself
as
to
be
able
to
conceal
her
dismay
from
the
servant
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
Triumphs
 
report
have
,
of
course
,
reach
Mr.
Camperdown
of
the
true
story
of
the
Eustace
diamond
.
<EOS>
He
have
learn
that
the
Jew
jeweller
have
make
a
determined
set
at
them
,
have
in
the
first
place
hire
housebreaker
to
steal
them
at
Carlisle
,
and
have
again
hire
the
same
housebreaker
to
steal
them
from
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
,
as
soon
as
he
know
that
Lady
Eustace
have
herself
secrete
them
.
<EOS>
by
degree
this
information
have
reach
him
,
 
but
not
in
a
manner
to
induce
him
to
declare
himself
satisfied
with
the
truth
.
<EOS>
but
now
Lady
Eustace
be
come
to
him
,
 
as
he
presume
,
to
confess
everything
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
first
hear
that
the
diamond
have
be
steal
at
Carlisle
,
he
be
eager
with
Mr.
Eustace
in
contend
that
the
widow
's
liability
in
regard
to
the
property
be
not
at
all
the
less
because
she
have
manage
to
lose
it
through
her
own
pig
-
head
obstinacy
.
<EOS>
He
consult
his
trust
friend
,
Mr.
Dove
,
on
the
occasion
,
make
out
another
case
for
the
barrister
,
and
Mr.
Dove
have
opine
that
,
if
it
could
be
first
prove
that
the
diamond
be
the
property
of
the
estate
and
not
of
Lady
Eustace
,
and
afterwards
prove
that
they
have
be
steal
through
her
lache
,
 
then
could
the
Eustace
estate
recover
the
value
from
her
estate
.
<EOS>
as
she
have
carry
the
diamond
about
with
her
in
an
absurd
manner
,
her
responsibility
may
probably
be
establish
;
 
but
the
non
-
existence
of
ownership
by
her
must
be
first
declare
by
a
Vice
-
Chancellor
,
 
with
probability
of
appeal
to
the
Lords
Justices
and
to
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
a
bill
in
chancery
must
be
file
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
have
the
question
of
ownership
settle
;
and
then
,
should

<EOS>
that

,
and
Mr.
Camperdown
have
at
once

to
the
law
of
his
great
legal
mentor
.
<EOS>
but
John
Eustace
have
positively
declare
when
he
hear
it
that
no
more
money
should
be
throw
away
in
look
after
property
which
would
require
two
lawsuit
to
establish
,
and
which
,
when
establish
,
may
not
be
recover
.
<EOS>
"
how
can
we
make
her
pay
ten
thousand
pound
?
<EOS>
She
may
die
first
,
"
say
John
Eustace
;
 
and
Mr.

to
yield
.
<EOS>
then
come

and
gradually
there

about
a
report
that
the

Hertford
Street
all
the
time
;
 
that
they

last
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
be
again
in
a
fever
,
and
again

and
to
John

<EOS>
He

and
now
the
whole
truth

to
be
divulge
to
him
by
the
chief
culprit
herself
.
<EOS>
for
,
to
the
mind
of
Mr.
Camperdown
the
two
housebreaker
,
and
Patience
Crabstick
,
 
and
even
Mr.
Benjamin
himself
,
be
white
as
snow
compare
with
the
blackness
of
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
in
his
estimation
no
punishment
could
be
too
great
for
her
,
 
and
yet
he
begin
to
understand
that
she
would
escape
scot
-
free
!
<EOS>
Her
evidence
would
be
need
to
convict
the
thief
,
and
she
could
not
be

for
perjury
when
once
she
have
be
ask

.
<EOS>
"
after
all

the
Turtle

<EOS>
be

your

would
be
all
so
much
in

"
<EOS>
with
infinite
regret
,
Mr.
Camperdown
begin
to
perceive
that
nothing
could
be

to
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
to
come
to
him
and
let
him
know
,
from
her

lip
<EOS>
,
fact
of
which
nothing
more
than
rumour
have
yet

<EOS>
He
have
commence
his
bill
in

and
have
hitherto
stay

simply
because
it
have
be

falsely

that
the

<EOS>
major
Mackintosh
,
in
his
desire
to
use
Lizzie

have
recommend
her
to
tell
the
whole
truth
openly
to
those
who
claim
the
property
on
behalf
of
her

estate
;
and
now
,
for
the
first
time
in

him
in
his

<EOS>
He
do
not

<EOS>
He

his
mentor
,
Mr.
Dove
,
and
his
client
,
John
Eustace
,
and
the
latter
consent
to
be
present

<EOS>
It
be
suggest
to
Mr.

that
he
may
,
on
so
peculiar
an
occasion
as
this
,
venture
to
depart
from
the

,
and
visit
the
attorney
on
his
own
quarter
-
deck
;
but
he
smile
,
and
explain
that
,
though
he
be
altogether
superior
to
any
such
prejudice
as
that
,
and
would
not
object
at
all
to
call
on
his
friend
,
Mr.
Camperdown
,
could
any
good
effect
arise
from
his
do
so
<EOS>
,
he
consider
that
,
be
he
to
be
present
on
this
occasion
,
he
would
simply
assist
in
embarrass
the
poor
lady
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
very
morning
,
while
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
abuse
Lizzie

Hertford

,
John
Eustace
and
Mr.
Camperdown
be
in
Mr.
Dove
's
chamber
,
whither
they
have
go
to
tell
him
of
the
coming
interview
.
<EOS>
the
Turtle
Dove
be
sit
back
in
his
chair
,
with
his
head
lean
forward
as
though
it
be
go
to
drop
from
his
neck
,
and
the
two
visitor
be
listen
to
his
word
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

merciful
,
I
should
say
,
"
suggest
the
barrister
.
<EOS>
John
Eustace
be
clearly
of
opinion
that
they
ought
to
be
merciful

<EOS>
Mr.

do
not
look
merciful
.
<EOS>
"
what
can
you
get
by

the
poor

weak
,
ignorant
creature

"
continue
Mr.

.
<EOS>
"
She
have
hanker
after
her
bauble
,
and
have
tell
falsehood
in
her
effort
to
keep
it

<EOS>
have
you
never

of
old
person
,
and
more
learned
person
,
and
person
near
to
ourselves
,
who
have
do
the
same
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
that
moment
there
be
presume
to
be
great
rivalry
,
not
unaccompanied
by
intrigue
,
among
certain
leader
of
the
learned
profession
with
reference
to
various
position
of
high
honour
and
emolument
,
vacant
or
expect
to
be
vacant
.
<EOS>
a
Lord
Chancellor
be
about
to
resign
,
and
a
Lord
Justice
have
die
.
<EOS>
whether
a
somewhat
unpopular
Attorney
-
General
should
be
force
to
satisfy
himself
with
the
one
place
,
or
allow
to
wait
for
the
other
,
have
be
debate
in
all
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
It
be
agree
that
there
be
a
middle
course
in
reference
to
a
certain
second

class
Chief

Justiceship
,
 
only
that
the
present
second

Chief

Justice
object
to
shelve
himself
.
<EOS>
there
exist
considerable
jealousy
,
and
some
statement
have
be
make
which
be
not
,
perhaps
,
strictly
found
on
fact
.
<EOS>
It
be
understand
,
both
by
the
attorney
and
by
the
Member
of
Parliament
,
that
the
Turtle
Dove
be
refer
to
these
circumstance
when
he
speak
of
bauble
and
falsehood
,
and
of
learned
person
near
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
He
himself
have
hanker
after
no
bauble
,
 
but
,
as
be
the
case
with
many
man
and
woman
who
be
free
from
such
hankering
,
he
be
hardly
free
from
that
dash
of
malice
which
the
possession
of
such
thing
in
the
hand
of
other
be
so
prone
to
excite
.
<EOS>
"
spare
her

Mr.

<EOS>
"
there
be
no
longer
any
material
question
as
to
the
property

which
seem
to
be
go
irrecoverably

<EOS>
It
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
well
for
the
world
,
that
property
so
fictitious
as

should
be

I
would
not

"
  
<EOS>
as
Eustace
and
the
attorney
walk
across
from
the
Old
to
the
New
Square
,
the
former
declare
that
he
quite
agree
with
Mr.

"
in

she

<EOS>
It
should
not

"
I

be
off

<EOS>
but
,
unfortunately
,
while
with
a
gentle
murmur
she
be

to
the
clerk
how
impossible
it
be
that
she
should
wait
for

John
Eustace
and
Mr.

although
it

<EOS>
She

she
could
answer
by
easy
monosyllable

<EOS>
Mr.

's
voice
,
as
he
put
to
her
this
vital
question

be
severe

almost
justify
the
little
burst
of
sobs
which
come
forth
as
a
prelude
to
Lizzie
's
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

I
do

You

the
difference

you

do
you
tell

that

They
never

Mr.

It
be
all
as
clear
as
a
pike

staff

John

the
lawyer

"
quite
clear

I

Mr.

I
suppose
I
may
go

say
Lizzie
,
rise
from
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
why
she
should
not
go
;
and
,
indeed
,
now
that
the
interview
be
over
,
there
do
not
seem
to
be
any
reason
why
she
should
have
come

though
they
have
hear
so
much
from
her
own
mouth

they
know
no
more
than
they
have
know
before

<EOS>
the
great
mystery
have
be
elucidate
,
and
Lizzie
Eustace
have
be
find
to
be
the
intriguing
villain
;
but
it
be
quite
clear
,
even
to
Mr.
Camperdown
,
that
nothing
could
be
do
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
really
think
that
it
would
be
expedient
that
she
should
be
prosecute
for
perjury
,
and
he
now
find
that
she
must
go
utterly
scatheless
,
although
,
by
her
obstinacy
and
dishonesty
,
she
have
inflict
so
great
a
loss
on
the
distinguished
family
which
have
take
her
to
its
bosom

I

you

Lady
Eustace

he
say
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
to

I

you

I

which
clearly

as
the
newspaper
have
say
!
<EOS>
lucinda

time
have
leave
the
house
in
Hertford
Street
,
but
Lizzie
have
not
be
inform
whither
she
have

<EOS>
She
could
not
apply
to
Lucinda
for
restitution
of
the
silver
,
 
which
be
,
in
fact
,
hold
at
the
moment
by
the
Albemarle
Street
hotel
-
keeper
as
part
security
for
his
debt

she
be
quite
sure
that
any
application
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
for
either
the
silver
or
the
debt
would
be
unavaile
.
<EOS>
but
she
may
,
perhaps
,
cause
annoyance
by
a
letter
,
and
could
,
at
any
rate
,
return
insult
for
insult
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
write
to
her
late
friend
.
  
<EOS>
MADAM
,
  
<EOS>
I
certainly
be
not
desirous
of
continue
an
acquaintance
into
which
I
be
lead
by
false
representation
,
and
in
the
course
of
which
I
have
be
almost
absurdly
hospitable
to
person
altogether
unworthy
of
my
kindness
.
<EOS>
You
,

your
niece
,
and
your
especial
friend
Lord
George
Carruthers

and
that
unfortunate
young
man
your
niece
's
lover

be
entertain
at
my

house

I
be
here

in

by
arrangement

as
I
pay
more
than
a

I
shall
stay
as
long

in

,
as
we
be
about
to
part

certainly
for
ever
,
I
must
beg
you
at
once
to
repay
me
the
sum

150

that
you
should

<EOS>
Yours

c.
,
  
E.
EUSTACE
.
  
<EOS>
as
far
as
the
application
for
restitution
go
,
or
indeed
in
regard
to
the
insult
,
she
may
as
well
have
write
to
a
milestone
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
much
too
strong
,
and
have
fight
her
battle
with
the
world
much
too
long
,
to
regard
such
word
-
pelting
as
that
.
<EOS>
She
pay
no
attention
to
the
note
,
and
as
she
have
come
to
term
with
the
agent
of
the
house
by
which
she
be
to
evacuate
it
on
the
follow
Monday
,
 
a
fact
which
be
communicate
to
Lizzie
by
the
servant
,
 
<EOS>
she
do
not
much
regard
Lizzie
's
threat
to
remain
there
.
<EOS>
She
know
,
moreover
,
that
arrangement
be
already
be
make
for
the
journey
to
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
come
back
from
the
attorney
's
chamber
in
triumph
,
and
have
be
triumphant
when
she
write
her
note
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
;
but
her
elation
be
considerably
repress
by
a
short
notice
which
she
read
in
the
fashionable
evening
paper
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
She
always
take
the
fashionable
evening
paper
,
and
have
teach
herself
to
think
that
life
without
it
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
but
on
this
afternoon
she
quarrel
with
that
fashionable
evening
paper
for
ever
.
<EOS>
the
popular
and
well
-
inform
organ
of
intelligence
in
question
inform
its
reader
,
that
the
Eustace
diamond
 
&
c.
,
&
c.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
tell
the
whole
story
;
and
then
express
a
hope
that
,
as
the
matter
have
from
the
commencement
be
one
of
great
interest
to
the
public
,
who
have
sympathise
with
Lady
Eustace
deeply
as
to
the
loss
of
her
diamond
,
Lady
Eustace
would
be
able
to
explain
that
part
of
her
conduct
which
certainly
,
at
present
,
be
quite
unintelligible
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
throw
the
paper
from
her
with
indignation
,
ask
what
right
newspaper
scribbler
could
have
to
interfere
with
the
private
affair
of
such
person
as
herself
!
  
<EOS>
but
on
this
evening
the
question
of
her
answer
to
Lord
Fawn
be
the
one
which
most
interest
her
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
take
long
in
the
writing
of
his
letter
,
and
she
be
justified
in
take
what
time
she
please
in
answer
it
;
 
but
,
for
her
own
sake
,
it
have
better
be
answer
quickly
.
<EOS>
She
have
try
her
hand
at
two
different
reply
,
and
do
not
at
all
doubt
but
what
she
would
send
the
affirmative
answer
,
if
she
be
sure
that
these
latter
discovery
would
not
alter
Lord
Fawn
's
decision
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
distinctly
tell
her
that
,
if
she
please
,
he
would
marry
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
please
;
 
have
be
much
trouble
by
the
circumstance
of
the
past
six
month
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
be
it
not
almost
a
certainty
that
Lord
Fawn
would
retreat
from
his
offer
on
learn
the
fact
which
be
now
so
well
know
as
to
have
be
relate
in
the
public
paper
?
<EOS>
She
think
that
she
would
take
one
more
night
to
think
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
she
take
one
night
too
many
.
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
,
while
she
be
still
in
bed
,
a
letter
be
bring
to
her
from
Lord
Fawn
,
date
from
his
club
the
precede
evening
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
present
his
compliment
to
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
will
be
kind
enough
to
understand
that
Lord
Fawn
recede
altogether
from
the
proposition
make
by
him
in
his
letter
to
Lady
Eustace
date
March
28th
last
.
<EOS>
Should
Lady
Eustace
think
proper
to
call
in
question
the
propriety
of
this
decision
on
the
part
of
Lord
Fawn
,
she
have
better
refer
the
question
to
some
friend
,
and
Lord
Fawn
will
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
think
it
good
to
express
his
determination
,
under
no
circumstance
,
to
communicate
again
personally
with
Lady
Eustace
on
this
subject
,
 
or
,
as
far
as
he
can
see
at
present
,
on
any
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
letter
be
a
blow
to
her
,
although
she
have
feel
quite
certain
that
Lord
Fawn
would
have
no
difficulty
in
escape
from
her
hand
as
soon
as
the
story
of
the
diamond
should
be
make
public
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
blow
to
her
,
although
she
have
assure
herself
a
dozen
time
that
a
marriage
with
such
a
one
as
Lord
Fawn
,
a
man
who
have
not
a
grain
of
poetry
in
his
composition
,
would
make
her
unutterably
wretched
.
<EOS>
what
escape
would
her
heart
have
have
from
itself
in
such
a
union
?
<EOS>
this
question
she
have
ask
herself
over
and
over
again
,
and
there
have
be
no
answer
to
it
.
<EOS>
but
then
why
have
she
not
be
beforehand
with
Lord
Fawn
?
<EOS>
why
have
she
not
reject
his
second
offer
with
the
scorn
which
such
an
offer
have
deserve
?
<EOS>
ah
,
 
there
be
her
misfortune
;
there
be
her
fault
!
  
<EOS>
but
,
with
Lizzie
Eustace
,
when
she
could
not
do
a
thing
which
it
be
desirable
that
she
should
be
know
to
have
do
,
the
next
consideration
be
whether
she
could
not
so
arrange
as
to
seem
to
have
do
it
.
<EOS>
the
arrival
of
Lord
Fawn
's
note
just
as
she
be
about
to
write
to
him
,
be
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
still
write
to
him
,
and
date
her
letter
before
the
time
that
his
be
date
.
<EOS>
He
probably
would
not
believe
her
date
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
ever
expect
to
be
really
believe
by
anybody
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
have
to
read
what
she
write
;
and
write
on
this
pretence
,
she
would
avoid
the
necessity
of
allude
to
his
last
letter
.
  
<EOS>
neither
of
the
note
which
she
have
by
her
quite
suited
the
occasion
,
 
so
she
write
a
third
.
<EOS>
the
former
letter
in
which
she
decline
his
offer
be
,
she
think
,
very
charmingly
insolent
,
and
the
allusion
to
his
lordship
's
scullion
would
have
be
successful
,
have
it
be
send
on
the
moment
,
but
now
a
graver
letter
be
require
,
 
and
the
graver
letter
be
as
follow
:
    
Hertford
Street
,
Wednesday
,
April
3
.
  
---
<EOS>
the
date
,
it
will
be
observe
,
be
the
day
previous
to
the
morning
on
which
she
have
receive
Lord
Fawn
's
last
very
conclusive
note
.
    
<EOS>
my
LORD
,
  
I
have
take
a
week
to
answer
the
letter
which
your
lordship
have
do
me
the
honour
of
write
to
me
,
because
I
have
think
it
best
to
have
time
for
consideration
in
a
matter
of
such
importance
.
<EOS>
in
this
I
have
copy
your
lordship
's
official
caution
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
read
a
letter
so
false
,
so
unmanly
,
and
so
cowardly
,
as
that
which
you
have
find
yourself
capable
of
send
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
You
become
engaged
to
me
when
,
as
I
admit
with
shame
,
I
do
not
know
your
character
.
<EOS>
You
have
since
repudiate
me
and
vilify
my
name
,
simply
because
,
have
find
that
I
have
enemy
,
and
be
afraid
to
face
them
,
you
wish
to
escape
from
your
engagement
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
cowardice
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Your
whole
conduct
to
me
have
be
one
long
,
unprovoked
insult
,
studiously
concoct
,
because
you
have
fear
that
there
may
possibly
be
some
trouble
for
you
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
nobody
ever
hear
of
anything
<EOS>
so
mean
,
either
in
novel
or
in
real
life
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
you
again
offer
to
marry
me
,
 
because
you
be
again
afraid
.
<EOS>
You
think
you
will
be
thrash
,
I
suppose
,
if
you
decline
to
keep
your
engagement
;
and
feel
that
if
you
offer
to
go
on
with
it
,
my
friend
can
not
beat
you

You
need
not
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
no
earthly
consideration
would
induce
me
to
be
your
wife

<EOS>
and
if
any
friend
of
mine
should
look
at
you
as
though
he
mean
to
punish
you
,
you
can
show
him
this
letter
and
make
him
understand
that
it
be
I
who
have
refuse
to
be
your

<EOS>
this
epistle
Lizzie
do
send
,
believe
that
she
could
add
nothing
to
its
insolence
,
let
her
study
it
as
she
may
.
<EOS>
and
,
she
think
,
as
she
read
it
for
the
fifth
time
,
that
it
sound
as
though
it
have
be
write
before
her
receipt
of
the
final
note
from
himself
,
and
that
it
would
,
therefore
,
irritate
him
the
more
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
to
be
the
last
week
of
her
sojourn
in
town
,
and
then
she
be
to
go
down
and
bury
herself
at
Portray
,
with
no
other
companionship
than
that
of
the
faithful
Macnulty
,
who
have
be
leave
in
Scotland
for
the
last
three
month
as
nurse
-
in
-
chief
to
the
little
heir
.
<EOS>
She
must
go
and
give
her
evidence
before
the
magistrate
on
Friday
,
as
to
which
she
have
already
receive
an
odious
slip
of
paper
;
 
but
Frank
would
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
other
misfortune
have
pass
off
so
lightly
that
she
hardly
dread
this
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
quite
understand
why
she
be
to
be
so
banished
,
and
think
much
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
She
have
submit
herself
to
Frank
's
advice
when
first
she
have
begin
to
fear
that
her
trouble
would
be
insuperable
.
<EOS>
Her
trouble
be
now
disappear
;
and
,
as
for
Frank
,
 
what
be
Frank
to
her
,
that
she
should
obey
him
?
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
her
trunk
be
be
already
pack
,
and
she
know
that
she
must
go
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
accompany
her
on
her
journey
,
and
she
would
still
have
one
more
chance
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
be
think
of
all
this
,
Mr.
Emilius
,
the
clergyman
,
be
announce
.
<EOS>
in
her
loneliness
she
be
delighted
to
receive
any
visitor
,
and
she
know
that
Mr.
Emilius
would
be
at
least
courteous
to
her
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
seat
himself
,
he
at
once
begin
to
talk
about
the
misfortune
of
the
unaccomplished
marriage
,
and
in
a
very
low
voice
hint
that
from
the
beginning
to
end
there
have
be
something
wrong
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
fear
that
an
alliance
base
on
a
footing
that
be
so
openly
"
pecuniary
,
"
 
he
declare
that
the
word
pecuniary
express
his
meaning
better
than
any
other
epithet
,
 
could
not
lead
to
matrimonial
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
our
dear
friend
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
have
view
of
her
own
quite
distinct
from
her
niece
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
great
possible
respect
for
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
and
I
may
say
esteem
;
but
it
be
impossible
to
live
long
in
any
degree
of
intimacy
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
without
see
that
she
be
 
mercenary
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mercenary
;
 
indeed
she
be
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
observe
it
?
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
;
it
be
so
,
and
it
cast
a
shadow
over
a
character
which
otherwise
have
so
much
to
charm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
the
most
insolent
and
the
most
ungrateful
woman
that
I
ever
hear
of
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Lizzie
,
with
energy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
open
his
eye
,
but
do
not
contradict
her
assertion
.
"
<EOS>
as
you
have
mention
her
name
,
Mr.
Emilius
,
I
must
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
everything
for
that
woman
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
I
treat
her
down
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
with
a
splendid
hospitality
,
"
say
Mr.
Emilius
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
she
do
not
pay
for
anything
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
.
<EOS>
"
the
idea
of
any
one
be
call
upon
to
pay
for
what
one
eat
and
drink
at
a
friend
's
house
,
be
peculiarly
painful
to
Mr.
Emilius
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
have
pay
for
everything
here
.
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
we
have
make
an
arrangement
,
very
much
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
borrow
large
sum
of
money
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
at
all
surprised
at
that
,
"
say
Mr.
Emilius
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
when
that
unfortunate
girl
,
her
niece
,
be
to
be
married
to
poor
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
,
I
give
her
a
whole
service
of
plate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
unparalleled
generosity
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
believe
she
have
take
the
whole
for
her
own
base
purpose
?
<EOS>
and
then
what
do
you
think
she
have
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lady
Eustace
,
hardly
anything
would
astonish
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
suddenly
find
a
difficulty
in
describe
to
her
friend
the
fact
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
be
endeavour
to
turn
her
out
of
the
house
,
without
also
allude
to
her
own
trouble
about
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
actually
tell
me
,
"
she
continue
,
"
that
I
must
leave
the
house
without
a
day
's
warning
.
<EOS>
but
I
believe
the
truth
be
,
that
she
have
run
so
much
into
debt
that
she
can
not
remain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
she
be
very
much
in
debt
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
she
owe
me
some
civility
.
<EOS>
instead
of
that
,
she
have
treat
me
with
nothing
but
insolence
.
<EOS>
and
why
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
It
be
all
because
I
would
not
allow
her
to
take
that
poor
,
insane
young
woman
to
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
that
she
ask
to
go
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
do
,
though
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
such
impertinence
in
my
life
,
 
never
,
"
say
Mr.
Emilius
,
again
open
his
eye
and
shake
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
propose
that
I
should
ask
them
both
down
to
Portray
,
for
 
for
 
<EOS>
of
course
it
would
have
be
almost
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
I
should
have
get
rid
of
them
.
<EOS>
and
that
poor
young
woman
be
mad
,
you
know
;
 
quite
mad
.
<EOS>
She
never
recover
herself
after
that
morning
.
<EOS>
oh
,
 
what
I
have
suffer
about
that
unhappy
marriage
,
and
the
cruel
,
cruel
way
in
which
Mrs.
Carbuncle
urge
it
on
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
,
you
can
not
conceive
the
scene
which
have
be
act
in
this
house
during
the
last
month
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
dreadful
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
go
through
such
a
time
again
for
anything
that
could
be
offer
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
have
make
me
so
ill
that
I
be
oblige
to
go
down
to
Scotland
to
recruit
my
health
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
that
you
be
go
to
Scotland
,
and
I
wish
to
have
an
opportunity
of
say
 
just
a
word
to
you
,
in
private
,
before
you
go
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
have
think
a
good
deal
about
this
interview
,
and
have
prepare
himself
for
it
with
considerable
care
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
with
tolerable
accuracy
,
the
whole
story
of
the
necklace
,
have
discuss
it
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
who
,
as
the
reader
will
remember
,
have
be
tell
the
tale
by
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
He
be
aware
of
the
engagement
with
Lord
Fawn
,
and
of
the
grow
intimacy
which
have
exist
between
Lord
George
and
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
watchful
,
diligent
,
patient
,
and
have
at
last
become
hopeful
.
<EOS>
when
he
learn
that
his
beloved
be
about
to
start
for
Scotland
,
he
feel
that
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
strike
a
blow
before
she
go
.
<EOS>
as
to
a
journey
down
to
Ayrshire
,
that
would
be
nothing
to
one
so
enamour
as
be
Mr.
Emilius
;
and
he
would
not
scruple
to
show
himself
at
the
castle
-
door
without
invitation
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
have
be
his
deficiency
,
Mr.
Emilius
do
not
lack
the
courage
need
to
carry
such
an
enterprise
as
this
to
a
happy
conclusion
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
pluck
and
courage
may
serve
a
man
,
he
be
well
serve
by
his
own
gift
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
without
a
blush
,
or
a
quiver
in
his
voice
,
have
ask
a
duchess
to
marry
him
,
with
ten
time
Lizzie
's
income
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
consider
deeply
whether
,
with
the
view
of
prevail
,
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
allude
to
the
lady
's
trespass
in
regard
to
the
diamond
,
or
that
he
should
pretend
to
be
in
ignorance
;
and
he
have
determine
that
ultimate
success
may
,
with
most
probability
,
be
achieve
by
a
bold
declaration
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
desperately
you
must
be
in
want
of
some
one
to
help
you
through
your
trouble
,
and
I
know
also
that
your
grand
lover
will
avoid
you
because
of
what
you
have
do
,
and
therefore
you
have
well
take
me
at
once
.
<EOS>
take
me
,
and
I
will
bring
you
through
everything
.
<EOS>
refuse
me
,
and
I
will
help
to
crush
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
be
the
argument
which
Mr.
Emilius
have
determine
to
use
,
and
such
the
language
,
 
of
course
,
with
some
modification
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
commence
his
work
,
and
be
quite
resolve
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
in
carry
it
to
a
successful
issue
.
<EOS>
He
draw
his
chair
nearer
to
Lizzie
as
he
announce
his
desire
for
a
private
interview
,
and
lean
over
towards
her
with
his
two
hand
close
together
between
his
knee
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
dark
,
hookey
-
nosed
,
well
-
make
man
,
with
an
exuberance
of
greasy
hair
,
who
would
have
be
consider
handsome
by
many
woman
,
have
there
not
be
something
,
almost
amount
to
a
squint
,
amiss
with
one
of
his
eye
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
preach
,
it
could
hardly
be
see
,
but
in
the
closeness
of
private
conversation
it
be
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
 
indeed
!
"
say
Lizzie
,
with
a
look
of
astonishment
,
perfectly
well
assume
.
<EOS>
She
have
already
begin
to
consider
whether
,
after
all
,
Mr.
Emilius
 
would
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
;
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
have
know
each
other
now
for
many
month
,
and
I
have
receive
the
most
unaffected
pleasure
from
the
acquaintance
,
 
may
I
not
say
from
the
intimacy
which
have
spring
up
between
us
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
do
not
forbid
the
use
of
the
pleasant
word
,
but
merely
bow
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
,
as
a
devoted
friend
and
a
clergyman
,
I
shall
not
be
think
to
be
intrude
on
private
ground
in
say
that
circumstance
have
make
me
aware
of
the
detail
of
the
robbery
by
which
you
have
be
so
cruelly
persecute
.
"
<EOS>
so
the
man
have
come
about
the
diamond
,
and
not
to
make
an
offer
!
<EOS>
Lizzie
raise
her
eyebrow
and
bow
her
head
with
the
slight
possible
motion
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
far
your
friend
or
the
public
may
condemn
you
,
but
 
"
  
"
My
friend
do
not
condemn
me
at
all
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
to
hear
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
have
dare
to
condemn
me
,
except
this
impudent
woman
here
,
who
want
an
excuse
for
not
pay
me
what
she
owe
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
delighted
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
explain
that
although
I
be
aware
you
have
infringe
the
letter
of
the
law
,
and
make
yourself
liable
to
proceeding
which
may
,
perhaps
,
be
unpleasant
 
"
  
"
I
be
not
liable
to
anything
unpleasant
at
all
,
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
my
mind
be
greatly
relieved
.
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
remark
,
have
hear
in
the
outer
world
that
there
be
those
who
venture
to
accuse
you
of
 
of
perjury
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
nobody
have
dare
to
accuse
me
of
anything
.
<EOS>
what
make
you
come
here
and
say
such
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
 
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
It
be
because
these
calumny
be
speak
so
openly
behind
your
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
speak
them
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
Lord
George
Carruthers
;
 
my
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
be
begin
to
feel
that
he
be
not
make
progress
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
on
the
point
of
observe
to
you
that
accord
to
the
view
of
the
matter
which
I
,
as
a
clergyman
,
have
take
,
you
be
altogether
justified
in
the
step
which
you
take
for
the
protection
of
property
which
be
your
own
,
but
which
have
be
attack
by
design
person

<EOS>

of
course
I
be
justify

say
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
best
,
Lady
Eustace
,
whether
any
assistance
I
can
offer
will
avail
you
anything

<EOS>

I
do
not
want
any
assistance

Mr.
Emilius

thank
you

give
to

stand
by
you

the
close
devotion

in
this
period

cold

so

I
reciprocate

to
come
to
what
I
may
call
the
inner

of
my
visit
to

this
morning

the
sweet
cause
of
my
attendance

let

assure

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
have
find
the
necessity
of
come
to
the
point
by
some
direct
road
,
as
the
lady
have
refuse
to
allow
him
to
lead
up
to
it
in
the
manner
he
have
propose
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
still
think
that
what
he
have
say
may
be
efficacious
,
as
he
do
not
for
a
moment
believe
her
assertion
as
to
her
own
friend
,
and
the
non
-
existence
of
any
trouble
as
to
the
oath
which
she
have
falsely
swear
.
<EOS>
but
she
carry
the
matter
with
a
well
courage
than
he
have
expect
to
find
,
and
drive
him
out
of
his
intend
line
of
approach
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
seize
his
opportunity
without
lose
much
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
,
Mr.

<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
lay
my
heart
,
my
hand
,
my

at
your

<EOS>
I
make
bold
to

of
myself
that
I

by
my

win
for
myself
a
great

I

too
acutely
.
<EOS>
I
have
be

that
you

but
I

me
from
the

the
profession
which
I
have
adopt

the
grand
which
ever
fill
the
heart

<EOS>
I
have
barely
turn
my
thirty
-
second
year

and
I
be
know
as
the
great
preacher
of
my
day
,
though
I
preach
in
a
language
which
be
not

<EOS>
Your
House

will

"
  
<EOS>
the
man
be
a
nasty
,
greasy
,
lying
,
squint
Jew
preacher
;
an
impostor
,
over
forty
year
of
age
,
whose
great
social
success
have
be
achieve
when
,
through
the
agency
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
he
make
his
way
into
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
He
be
about
as
near
an
english
mitre
as
have
be
that
great
man
of
a
past
generation
,
the
Deputy
Shepherd
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
creature
to
loathe
,
 
because
he
be
greasy
,
and
a
liar
,
and
an
impostor
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
certain
manliness
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
afraid
of
the
woman
;
and
in
plead
his
cause
with
her
he
could
stand
up
for
himself
courageously
.
<EOS>
He
have
study
his
speech
,
and
have
study
it
,
he
know
how
to
utter
the
word
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
blush
,
nor
stammer
,
nor
cringe
.
<EOS>
of
grandfather
or
grandmother
belong
to
himself
he
have
probably
never
hear
,
but
he
could
so
speak
of
his
noble
ancestor
as
to
produce
belief
in
Lizzie
's
mind

<EOS>
and
he
almost
succeed
in
convince
her
that
he
be
,
by
the
consent
of
mankind
,
the
great
preacher
of
the
day

<EOS>
while
he
be
make
his
speech
she
almost
like
his
squint

<EOS>
She
certainly
like
the
grease
and
nastiness
.
<EOS>
Presuming
,
as
she
naturally
do
,
that
something
of
what
he
say
be
false
,
she
like
the
lie
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
dash
of
poetry
about
him
;
and
poetry
,
as
she
think
,
be
not
compatible
with
humdrum
truth
.
<EOS>
a
man
,
to
be
a
man
in
her
eye
,
should
be
able
to
swear
that
all
his
goose
be
swans
;
 
should
be
able
to
reckon
his
swan
by
the
dozen
,
though
he
have
not
a
feather
belong
to
him
,
even
from
a
goose
's
wing
.
<EOS>
She
like
his
audacity
;
and
then
,
when
he
be
make
love
,
he
be
not
afraid
of
talk
out
boldly
about
his
heart
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
be
only
Mr.
Emilius
,
the
clergyman
;
and
she
have
mean
of
know
that
his
income
be
not
generous
.
<EOS>
though
she
admire
his
manner
and
his
language
,
she
be
quite
aware
that
he
be
in
pursuit
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
and
from
the
moment
in
which
she
first
understand
his
object
,
she
be
resolve
that
she
would
never
become
the
wife
of
Mr.
Emilius
as
long
as
there
be
a
hope
as
to
Frank
Greystock

<EOS>
"
I

tell

It
be
a
falsehood

Lady
Eustace

<EOS>
from
motive
of
pure
charity
I
give
a
home

a
distant
cousin

I
be
then
in
a
land
of
stranger

and
my
life
be
misinterpret

<EOS>
I
make
no
complaint
,
but
send
the
lady
back
to
her
native
country
.
<EOS>
My
compassion
could
supply
her
want
there
as
well
as
here

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
still
support
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
bethink
himself
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
danger
in
assert
that
he
be
subject
to
such
an
encumbrance

<EOS>
"
I
do
do
so

he
answer

till
she
find
a
congenial
home
as
the
wife

an
honest
man

<EOS>
"
oh
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
glad
to
hear
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
Lady
Eustace
,
may
I
venture
to
hope
for
a
favourable
answer
?
"
  
<EOS>
upon
this
,
Lizzie
make
him
a
speech
as
long
and
almost
as
well
-
turn
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
have
of
late
be
subject
to
many
vicissitude
.
<EOS>
She
have
lose
the
dear
husband
that
a
woman
have
ever
worship
.
<EOS>
She
have
venture
,
for
purpose
with
reference
to
her
child
which
she
could
not
now
explain
,
to
think
once
again
of
matrimony
with
a
man
of
high
rank
,
but
who
have
turn
out
to
be
unworthy
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
recede
;
 
Lizzie
,
as
she
say
this
,
act
the
part
of
recede
with
a
fine
expression
of
scornful
face
;
 
and
after
that
she
be
unwilling
to
entertain
any
further
idea
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
upon
hear
this
,
Mr.
Emilius
bow
low
,
and
before
the
street
-
door
be
close
against
him
have
begin
to
calculate
how
much
a
journey
to
Scotland
would
cost
him
.
   
<EOS>
Lizzie
at
the
Police
-
Court
 
<EOS>
on
the
Wednesday
and
Thursday
Lizzie
have
be
triumphant
;
for
she
have
certainly
come
out
unscathed
from
Mr.
Camperdown
's
chamber
,
and
a
lady
may
surely
be
say
to
triumph
when
a
gentleman
lay
his
hand
,
his
heart
,
his
fortune
,
and
all
that
he
have
get
,
at
her
foot
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
Friday
come
,
though
she
be
determined
to
be
brave
,
her
heart
do
sink
within
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
She
understand
well
that
she
would
be
call
upon
to
admit
in
public
the
falseness
of
the
oath
she
have
swear
upon
two
occasion
;
and
that
,
though
she
would
not
be
make
amenable
to
any
absolute
punishment
for
her
perjury
,
she
would
be
subject
to
very
damaging
remark
from
the
magistrate
,
and
probably
also
from
some
lawyer
employ
to
defend
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
She
go
to
bed
in
fairly
good
spirit
,
but
in
the
morning
she
be
cow
and
unhappy
.
<EOS>
She
dress
herself
from
head
to
foot
in
black
,
and
prepare
for
herself
a
heavy
black
veil
.
<EOS>
She
have
order
from
the
livery
stable
a
brougham
for
the
occasion
,
think
it
wise
to
avoid
the
display
of
her
own
carriage
.
<EOS>
She
breakfast
early
,
and
then
take
a
large
glass
of
wine
to
support
her
.
<EOS>
when
Frank
call
for
her
at
a
quarter
to
ten
,
she
be
quite
ready
,
and
grasp
his
hand
almost
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
but
she
look
into
his
face
with
her
eye
fill
with
tear
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
soon
be
over
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
She
press
his
hand
,
and
make
him
a
sign
to
show
that
she
be
ready
to
follow
him
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
the
case
will
come
on
at
once
,
"
he
say
,
"
so
that
you
will
not
be
keep
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
be
so
good
;
 
so
good
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
She
press
his
arm
,
and
do
not
speak
another
word
on
their
way
to
the
police
-
court
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
crowd
about
the
office
,
which
be
in
a
little
by
-
street
,
and
so
circumstance
that
Lizzie
's
brougham
could
hardly
make
its
way
up
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
but
way
be
at
once
make
for
her
when
Frank
hand
her
out
of
it
,
and
the
policeman
about
the
place
be
as
courteous
to
her
as
though
she
have
be
the
Lord
Chancellor
's
wife
.
<EOS>
evil
-
doing
will
be
speak
of
with
bated
breath
and
soft
word
even
by
policeman
,
when
the
evil
-
doer
come
in
a
carriage
,
and
with
a
title
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
lead
at
once
into
a
private
room
,
and
tell
that
she
would
be
keep
there
only
a
very
few
minute
.
<EOS>
Frank
make
his
way
into
the
court
and
find
that
two
magistrate
have
just
seat
themselves
on
the
bench
.
<EOS>
one
would
have
suffice
for
the
occasion
;
but
this
be
a
case
of
great
interest
,
and
even
police
-
magistrate
be
human
in
their
interest
.
<EOS>
Greystock
be
allow
to
get
round
to
the
bench
,
and
to
whisper
a
word
or
two
to
the
gentleman
who
be
to
preside
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
nod
his
head
,
and
then
the
case
begin
.
  
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
Mr.
Benjamin
have
be
send
back
in
durance
vile
from
Vienna
,
and
be
present
in
the
court
.
<EOS>
with
him
,
as
joint
malefactor
,
stand
Mr.
Smiler
,
the
great
housebreaker
,
a
huge
,
ugly
,
resolute
-
looking
scoundrel
,
possess
of
enormous
strength
,
who
be
very
intimately
know
to
the
police
,
with
whom
he
have
have
various
dealing
since
he
have
be
turn
out
upon
the
town
to
earn
his
bread
some
fifteen
year
before
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
long
before
that
he
have
know
the
police
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
his
memory
go
back
he
have
always
know
them
.
<EOS>
but
the
sportive
industry
of
his
boyish
year
be
not
now
count
up
against
him
.
<EOS>
in
the
last
fifteen
year
his
biography
have
be
write
with
all
the
accuracy
due
to
the
achievement
of
a
great
man
;
and
during
those
hundred
and
eighty
month
he
have
spend
over
one
hundred
in
prison
,
and
have
be
convict
twenty
-
three
time
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
grow
old
,
 
as
a
thief
;
and
it
be
think
by
his
friend
that
he
would
be
settle
for
life
in
some
quiet
retreat
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Benjamin
be
a
very
respectable
-
looking
man
of
about
fifty
,
with
slightly
grizzle
hair
,
with
excellent
black
clothe
,
show
,
by
a
surprised
air
,
his
great
astonishment
at
find
himself
in
such
a
position
.
<EOS>
He
speak
constantly
,
both
to
his
attorney
and
to
the
barrister
who
be
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
commit
,
and
throughout
the
whole
morning
be
very
busy
.
<EOS>
Smiler
,
who
be
quite
at
home
,
and
who
understand
his
position
,
never
say
a
word
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
He
stand
,
perfectly
straight
,
look
at
the
magistrate
,
and
never
for
a
moment
lean
on
the
rail
before
him
during
the
four
hour
that
the
case
consume
.
<EOS>
once
,
when
his
friend
,
Billy
Cann
,
be
bring
into
court
to
give
evidence
against
him
,
dress
up
to
the
eye
,
serene
and
sleek
as
when
we
see
him
once
before
at
the
"
rise
Sun
,
"
in
Meek
Street
,
Smiler
turn
a
glance
upon
him
which
,
to
the
eye
of
all
present
,
contain
a
threat
of
most
bloody
revenge
.
<EOS>
but
Billy
know
the
advantage
of
his
situation
,
and
nod
at
his
old
comrade
,
and
smile
.
<EOS>
His
old
comrade
be
very
much
strong
than
he
,
and
possess
of
many
natural
advantage
;
but
,
perhaps
,
upon
the
whole
,
his
old
comrade
have
be
the
less
intelligent
thief
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
the
bystander
read
the
meaning
of
Billy
's
smile
.
  
<EOS>
the
case
be
open
very
shortly
and
very
clearly
by
the
gentleman
who
be
employ
for
the
prosecution
.
<EOS>
It
would
all
,
he
say
,
have
lay
in
a
nutshell
,
have
it
not
be
complicate
by
a
previous
robbery
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
be
it
necessary
,
he
say
,
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
convict
the
prisoner
for
that
offence
also
,
but
it
have
be
think
advisable
to
confine
the
prosecution
to
the
act
of
burglary
commit
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
He
state
the
fact
of
what
have
happen
at
Carlisle
,
merely
for
explanation
,
but
would
state
nothing
that
could
not
be
prove
.
<EOS>
then
he
tell
all
that
the
reader
know
about
the
iron
box
.
<EOS>
but
the
diamond
be
not
then
in
the
box
,
 
and
he
tell
that
story
also
,
treat
Lizzie
with
great
tenderness
as
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
all
this
time
,
be
sit
behind
her
veil
in
the
private
room
,
and
do
not
hear
a
word
of
what
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
then
he
come
to
the
robbery
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
He
would
prove
by
Lady
Eustace
that
the
diamond
be
leave
by
her
in
a
lock
desk
,
 
be
so
deposited
,
though
all
her
friend
believe
them
to
have
be
take
at
Carlisle
;
and
he
would
,
moreover
,
prove
by
accomplice
that
they
be
steal
by
two
man
,
 
the
young
prisoner
at
the
bar
be
one
of
them
,
and
the
witness
who
would
be
adduce
,
the
other
,
 
that
they
be
give
up
by
these
man
to
the
elder
prisoner
,
and
that
a
certain
sum
have
be
pay
by
him
for
the
execution
of
the
two
robbery
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
more
of
it
;
 
but
to
the
reader
,
who
know
it
all
,
it
would
be
but
a
thrice
-
tell
tale
.
<EOS>
He
then
say
that
he
first
propose
to
take
the
evidence
of
Lady
Eustace
,
the
lady
who
have
be
in
possession
of
the
diamond
when
they
be
steal
.
<EOS>
then
Frank
Greystock
leave
the
court
,
and
return
with
poor
Lizzie
on
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
hand
to
a
chair
,
and
,
after
she
be
swear
,
be
tell
that
she
may
sit
down
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
request
to
remove
her
veil
,
which
she
have
replace
as
soon
as
she
have
kiss
the
book
.
<EOS>
the
first
question
ask
her
be
very
easy
.
<EOS>
do
she
remember
the
night
at
Carlisle
?
<EOS>
Would
she
tell
the
history
of
what
occur
on
that
night
?
<EOS>
when
the
box
be
steal
,
be
the
diamond
in
it
?
<EOS>
no
;
she
have
take
the
diamond
out
for
security
,
and
have
keep
them
under
her
pillow
.
<EOS>
then
come
a
bitter
moment
,
in
which
she
have
to
confess
her
perjury
before
the
Carlisle
bench
;
 
but
even
that
seem
to
pass
off
smoothly
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
ask
one
severe
question
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
to
say
,
Lady
Eustace
,
that
you
give
false
evidence
on
that
occasion
,
 
know
it
to
be
false
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
such
a
state
,
sir
,
from
fear
,
that
I
do
not
know
what
I
be
say
,
"
exclaim
Lizzie
,
burst
into
tear
and
stretch
forth
towards
the
bench
her
two
clasped
hand
with
the
air
of
a
suppliant
.
<EOS>
from
that
moment
the
magistrate
be
altogether
on
her
side
,
 
and
so
be
the
public
.
<EOS>
poor
ignorant
,
ill
-
use
young
creature
;
 
and
then
so
lovely
!
<EOS>
that
be
the
general
feeling
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
not
as
yet
come
beneath
the
harrow
of
the
learn
gentleman
on
the
other
side
,
whose
good
talent
be
due
to
Mr.
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
then
she
tell
all
she
know
about
the
other
robbery
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
have
not
say
,
when
examine
on
that
occasion
,
that
the
diamond
have
then
be
take
.
<EOS>
She
have
omit
to
name
the
diamond
in
her
catalogue
of
the
thing
steal
;
but
she
be
sure
that
she
have
never
say
that
they
be
not
then
take
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
nothing
about
the
diamond
,
know
them
to
be
her
own
,
and
prefer
to
lose
them
to
the
trouble
of
again
refer
to
the
night
at
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
such
be
her
evidence
for
the
prosecution
,
and
then
she
be
turn
over
to
the
very
learned
and
very
acute
gentleman
whom
Mr.
Benjamin
have
hire
for
his
defence
,
 
or
rather
,
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
send
for
trial
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
that
poor
Lizzie
do
receive
from
his
hand
some
of
that
punishment
which
she
certainly
deserve
.
<EOS>
this
acute
and
learn
gentleman
seem
to
possess
for
the
occasion
the
bland
and
most
dulcet
voice
that
ever
be
bestow
upon
an
english
barrister
.
<EOS>
He
address
Lady
Eustace
with
the
soft
word
,
as
though
he
hardly
dare
to
speak
to
a
woman
so
eminent
for
wealth
,
rank
,
and
beauty
;
but
nevertheless
he
ask
her
some
very
disagreeable
question
.
<EOS>
"
be
he
to
understand
that
she
go
of
her
own
will
before
the
bench
of
magistrate
at
Carlisle
,
with
the
view
of
enable
the
police
to
capture
certain
person
for
steal
certain
jewel
,
while
she
know
that
the
jewel
be
actually
in
her
own
possession
?
"
Lizzie
,
confound
by
the
softness
of
his
voice
as
join
to
the
harshness
of
the
question
,
could
hardly
understand
him
,
and
he
repeat
it
thrice
,
become
every
time
more
and
more
mellifluous
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
"
say
Lizzie
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
?
"
he
ask
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
do
send
the
Cumberland
police
after
man
for
steal
jewel
which
be
in
your
ladyship
's
own
hand
when
you
swear
the
information
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
your
ladyship
know
that
the
information
be
untrue
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
the
police
be
pursue
the
man
for
many
week
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
on
your
information
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
through
her
tear
.
"
<EOS>
and
your
ladyship
know
all
the
time
that
the
poor
man
be
altogether
innocent
of
take
the
jewel
?
"
<EOS>
"
but
they
take
the
box
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
through
her
tear
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
acute
and
learn
gentleman
,
"
somebody
take
your
ladyship
's
iron
box
out
of
the
room
,
and
you
swear
that
the
diamond
have
be
take
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
the
fact
that
legal
proceeding
be
be
take
against
you
for
recovery
of
the
diamond
by
person
who
claim
the
property
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
and
these
person
withdraw
their
proceeding
as
soon
as
they
hear
that
the
diamond
have
be
steal
?
"
  
<EOS>
soft
as
he
be
in
his
manner
,
he
nearly
reduce
Lizzie
Eustace
to
faint
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
her
that
the
question
would
never
end
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
the
magistrate
point
out
to
the
learned
gentleman
that
Lady
Eustace
have
confess
her
own
false
swearing
,
both
at
Carlisle
and
in
London
,
a
dozen
time
.
<EOS>
He
continue
his
question
over
and
over
again
,
harp
chiefly
on
the
affair
at
Carlisle
,
and
say
very
little
as
to
the
second
robbery
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
His
idea
be
to
make
it
appear
that
Lizzie
have
arrange
the
robbery
with
the
view
of
defraud
Mr.
Camperdown
,
and
that
Lord
George
Carruthers
be
her
accomplice
.
<EOS>
He
even
ask
her
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
and
with
the
sweetest
smile
,
whether
she
be
not
engage
to
marry
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
when
Lizzie
deny
this
,
he
still
suggest
that
some
such
alliance
may
be
in
contemplation
.
<EOS>
upon
this
,
Frank
Greystock
call
upon
the
magistrate
to
defend
Lady
Eustace
from
such
unnecessary
vulgarity
,
and
there
be
a
scene
in
the
court
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
do
not
like
the
scene
,
but
it
help
to
protect
her
from
the
contemplation
of
the
public
,
who
of
course
be
much
gratify
by
high
word
between
two
barrister
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
be
force
to
remain
in
the
private
room
during
the
examination
of
Patience
Crabstick
and
Mr.
Cann
;
and
she
do
not
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Patience
be
a
most
obdurate
and
difficult
witness
,
 
extremely
averse
to
say
evil
of
herself
,
and
on
that
account
unworthy
of
the
good
thing
which
she
have
receive
.
<EOS>
but
Billy
Cann
be
charm
,
 
graceful
,
communicative
,
and
absolutely
accurate
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
shake
him
.
<EOS>
the
learned
and
acute
gentleman
who
try
to
tear
him
in
piece
could
do
nothing
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
ask
whether
he
have
not
be
a
professional
thief
for
ten
year
.
<EOS>
"
ten
or
twelve
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
do
he
expect
that
any
juryman
would
believe
him
on
his
oath
?
"
<EOS>
not
unless
I
be
fully
corroborate
.
"
<EOS>
"
Can
you
look
that
man
in
the
face
,
 
that
man
who
be
at
any
rate
so
much
honester
than
yourself
?
"
ask
the
learned
gentleman
with
pathos
.
<EOS>
Billy
say
that
he
think
he
could
,
and
the
way
in
which
he
smile
upon
Smiler
cause
a
roar
through
the
whole
court
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
man
be
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
commit
for
trial
at
the
Central
Criminal
Court
,
and
Lizzie
Eustace
be
bind
by
certain
penalty
to
come
forward
when
call
upon
,
and
give
her
evidence
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
that
it
be
over
,
"
say
Frank
,
as
he
leave
her
at
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
hall
-
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frank
,
dearest
Frank
,
where
should
I
be
if
it
be
not
for
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Lord
George
give
His
reason
 
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
do
not
leave
the
house
during
the
Saturday
and
Sunday
,
and
engage
herself
exclusively
with
prepare
for
her
journey
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
further
interview
with
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
but
there
be
message
between
them
,
and
even
note
be
write
.
<EOS>
They
result
in
nothing
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
be
desirous
of
get
back
the
spoon
and
fork
,
and
,
if
possible
,
some
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
the
spoon
and
fork
be
out
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
power
,
 
in
Albemarle
Street
;
and
the
money
have
of
course
be
spend
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
may
have
save
herself
the
trouble
,
have
it
not
be
that
it
be
a
pleasure
to
her
to
insult
her
late
friend
,
even
though
in
do
so
new
insult
be
heap
upon
her
own
head
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
trumpery
spoon
,
they
,
 
so
say
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
 
be
the
property
of
Miss
Roanoke
,
have
be
make
over
to
her
unconditionally
long
before
the
wedding
,
as
a
part
of
a
separate
pecuniary
transaction
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
no
power
of
dispose
of
Miss
Roanoke
's
property
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
money
which
Lady
Eustace
claim
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
assert
that
,
when
the
final
account
should
be
make
up
between
them
,
it
would
be
find
that
there
be
a
considerable
balance
due
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
but
even
be
there
anything
due
to
Lady
Eustace
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
would
decline
to
pay
it
,
as
she
be
inform
that
all
money
possess
by
Lady
Eustace
be
now
confiscate
to
the
Crown
by
reason
of
the
PERJURIES
,
 
<EOS>
the
word
be
doubly
score
in
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
note
,
 
which
Lady
Eustace
have
commit
.
<EOS>
this
,
of
course
,
be
unpleasant
;
but
Mrs.
Carbuncle
do
not
have
the
honour
of
the
battle
all
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
also
say
some
unpleasant
thing
,
 
which
,
perhaps
,
be
the
more
unpleasant
because
they
be
true
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
come
pretty
nearly
to
the
end
of
her
career
,
whereas
Lizzie
's
income
,
in
spite
of
her
perjury
,
be
comparatively
untouched
.
<EOS>
the
undoubted
mistress
of
Portray
Castle
,
and
mother
of
the
Sir
Florian
Eustace
of
the
day
,
could
still
despise
and
look
down
upon
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
although
she
be
know
to
have
tell
fibs
about
the
family
diamond
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
always
come
to
Hertford
Street
on
a
Sunday
,
and
Lady
Eustace
leave
word
for
him
with
the
servant
that
she
would
be
glad
to
see
him
before
her
journey
into
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
go
to
-
morrow
,
do
she
?
"
say
Lord
George
to
the
servant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
;
I
will
see
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
be
show
up
to
her
room
before
he
go
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
in
send
to
him
,
have
some
half
-
form
idea
of
a
romantic
farewell
.
<EOS>
the
man
,
she
think
,
have
behave
very
badly
to
her
,
 
have
accept
very
much
from
her
hand
,
and
have
refuse
to
give
her
anything
in
return
;
have
become
the
first
depository
of
her
great
secret
,
and
have
place
no
mutual
confidence
in
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
harsh
to
her
,
and
unjust
;
and
then
,
too
,
he
have
decline
to
be
in
love
with
her
!
<EOS>
She
be
full
of
spite
against
Lord
George
,
and
would
have
be
glad
to
injure
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
there
would
be
some
excitement
in
a
farewell
in
which
some
mock
affection
may
be
display
,
and
she
would
have
an
opportunity
of
abuse
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
be
off
to
-
morrow
?
"
say
Lord
George
,
take
his
place
on
the
rug
before
her
fire
,
and
look
down
at
her
with
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
anger
against
the
man
chiefly
arise
from
a
feeling
that
he
treat
her
with
all
a
Corsair
's
freedom
without
any
of
a
Corsair
's
tenderness
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
forgive
the
want
of
deferential
manner
,
have
there
be
any
devotion
;
 
but
Lord
George
be
both
impudent
and
indifferent
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
thank
goodness
,
I
shall
get
out
of
this
frightful
place
to
-
morrow
,
and
soon
have
once
more
a
roof
of
my
own
over
my
head
.
<EOS>
what
an
experience
I
have
have
since
I
have
be
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
all
have
an
experience
,
"
say
Lord
George
,
still
look
at
her
with
that
half
-
comic
turn
of
his
face
,
 
almost
as
though
he
be
investigate
some
curious
animal
of
which
so
remarkable
a
speciman
have
never
before
come
under
his
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
woman
ever
intend
to
show
a
more
disinterested
friendship
than
I
have
do
;
and
what
have
be
my
return
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
disintereste
friendship
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
and
Lord
George
tap
his
breast
lightly
with
his
finger
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
still
a
little
on
one
side
,
and
there
be
still
the
smile
upon
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
allude
particularly
to
Mrs.
Carbuncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Eustace
,
I
can
not
take
charge
of
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
friendship
.
<EOS>
I
have
enough
to
do
to
look
after
my
own
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
any
complaint
to
make
against
me
,
 
I
will
at
least
listen
to

He
stand
there

down

speak

with

he

take

Scotland
 
<EOS>
Frank
Greystock
,
the
writer
fear
,
will
not
have
recommend
himself
to
those
reader
of
this
tale
who
think
the
part
of
lover
to
the
heroine
should
be
always
fill
by
a
young
man
with
heroic
attribute
.
<EOS>
and
yet
the
young
member
for
Bobsborough
be
by
no
mean
deficient
in
fine
quality
,
and
perhaps
be
quite
as
capable
of
heroism
as
the
majority
of
barrister
and
member
of
Parliament
among
whom
he
consort
,
and
who
be
to
him
 
the
world
.
<EOS>
a
man
bear
to
great
wealth
may
,
 
without
injury
to
himself
or
friend
,
 
do
pretty
nearly
what
he
like
in
regard
to
marriage
,
always
presume
that
the
wife
he
select
be
of
his
own
rank
.
<EOS>
He
nee
not
marry
for
money
,
nor
need
he
abstain
from
marriage
because
he
can
not
support
a
wife
without
money
.
<EOS>
and
the
very
poor
man
,
who
have
no
pretension
to
rank
or
standing
,
other
than
that
which
honesty
may
give
him
,
can
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
His
wife
's
fortune
will
consist
in
the
labour
of
her
hand
,
and
in
her
ability
to
assist
him
in
his
home
.
<EOS>
but
between
these
there
be
a
middle
class
of
man
,
who
,
by
reason
of
their
education
,
be
peculiarly
susceptible
to
the
charm
of
womanhood
,
but
who
literally
can
not
marry
for
love
,
because
their
earning
will
do
no
more
than
support
themselves
.
<EOS>
as
to
this
special
young
man
,
it
must
be
confess
that
his
earning
should
have
do
much
more
than
that
;
but
not
the
less
do
he
find
himself
in
a
position
in
which
marriage
with
a
penniless
girl
seem
to
threaten
him
and
her
with
ruin
.
<EOS>
all
his
friend
tell
Frank
Greystock
that
he
would
be
ruin
be
he
to
marry
Lucy
Morris
;
 
and
his
friend
be
people
suppose
to
be
very
good
and
wise
.
<EOS>
the
dean
,
and
the
dean
's
wife
,
his
father
and
mother
,
be
very
clear
that
it
would
be
so
.
<EOS>
Old
Lady
Linlithgow
have
speak
of
such
a
marriage
as
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Bobsborough
,
when
it
be
mention
in
his
hearing
,
have
declare
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
a
thousand
pity
.
<EOS>
and
even
dear
old
Lady
Fawn
,
though
she
wish
it
for
Lucy
's
sake
,
have
many
time
prophesy
that
such
a
thing
be
quite
impossible
.
<EOS>
when
the
rumour
of
the
marriage
reach
Lady
Glencora
,
Lady
Glencora
tell
her
friend
,
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
that
that
young
man
be
go
to
blow
his
brain
out
.
<EOS>
to
her
thinking
,
the
two
action
be
equivalent
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
we
read
of
such
man
that
we
feel
that
truth
to
his
sweetheart
be
the
first
duty
of
man
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
that
it
be
not
the
advice
which
we
give
to
our
son
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
advice
which
Frank
Greystock
have
most
persistently
give
to
himself
since
he
have
first
know
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
he
have
vacillate
,
but
,
on
the
balance
of
his
conviction
as
to
his
own
future
conduct
,
he
have
be
much
noble
than
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
hesitate
for
a
moment
as
to
the
value
of
Lucy
Morris
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
beautiful
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
wonderful
gift
of
nature
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
of
a
goddess
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
absolutely
penniless
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
be
what
the
world
call
well
-
dress
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
have
be
everything
to
him
.
<EOS>
there
have
grow
up
a
sympathy
between
them
quite
as
strong
on
his
part
as
on
hers
,
and
he
have
acknowledge
it
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
doubt
his
own
love
,
 
and
when
he
have
be
most
near
to
convince
himself
that
in
his
peculiar
position
he
ought
to
marry
his
rich
cousin
,
because
of
her
wealth
,
then
,
at
those
moment
,
he
have
most
strongly
feel
that
to
have
Lucy
Morris
close
to
him
be
the
great
charm
in
existence
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
his
cousin
's
money
,
join
to
flattery
and
caress
,
 
<EOS>
which
,
if
a
young
man
can
resist
,
he
be
almost
more
than
a
young
man
,
 
have
tempt
him
;
but
he
have
combat
the
temptation
.
<EOS>
on
one
memorable
evening
his
love
for
Lucy
have
tempt
him
.
<EOS>
to
that
temptation
he
have
yield
,
and
the
letter
by
which
he
become
engaged
to
her
have
be
write
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
mean
to
evade
it
;
 
have
always
tell
himself
that
it
should
not
be
evade
;
but
,
gradually
,
day
have
be
add
to
day
,
and
month
to
month
,
and
he
have
allow
her
to
languish
without
see
him
,
and
almost
without
hear
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
have
hear
from
all
side
that
she
be
desert
by
him
,
and
she
have
write
to
him
to
give
him
back
his
troth
;
but
she
have
not
send
her
letter
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
doubt
that
the
thing
be
over
,
 
she
hardly
doubt
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
would
not
send
any
letter
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
would
be
well
that
the
matter
should
be
allow
to
drop
without
any
letter
-
writing
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
reproach
him
,
 
though
she
would
ever
think
him
to
be
a
traitor
.
<EOS>
Would
not
she
have
starve
herself
for
him
,
could
she
so
have
serve
him
?
<EOS>
and
yet
he
could
bear
for
her
sake
no
touch
of
delay
in
his
prosperity
!
<EOS>
Would
she
not
have
be
content
to
wait
,
and
always
to
wait
,
 
so
that
he
with
some
word
of
love
would
have
tell
her
that
he
wait
also
?
<EOS>
but
he
would
not
only
desert
her
,
 
but
would
give
himself
to
that
false
,
infamous
woman
,
who
be
so
wholly
unfitted
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
for
Lucy
,
though
to
herself
she
would
call
him
a
traitor
,
 
and
would
think
him
to
be
a
traitor
,
still
regard
him
as
the
good
of
mankind
,
as
one
who
,
in
marry
such
a
one
as
Lizzie
Eustace
,
would
destroy
all
his
excellence
,
as
a
man
may
mar
his
strength
and
beauty
by
fall
into
a
pit
.
<EOS>
for
Lizzie
Eustace
Lucy
Morris
have
now
no
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
Lucy
have
almost
forget
Lizzie
's
lie
,
and
her
proffer
bribe
,
and
all
her
meanness
,
when
she
make
that
visit
to
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
then
,
when
Lizzie
claim
this
man
as
her
lover
,
a
full
remembrance
of
all
the
woman
's
iniquity
come
back
on
Lucy
's
mind
.
<EOS>
the
statement
that
Lizzie
then
make
,
Lucy
do
believe
.
<EOS>
She
do
think
that
Frank
,
her
Frank
,
the
man
whom
she
worship
,
be
to
take
this
harpy
to
his
bosom
as
his
wife
.
<EOS>
and
if
it
be
to
be
so
,
be
it
not
well
that
she
should
be
so
tell
?
<EOS>
but
,
from
that
moment
,
poor
Lizzie
's
sin
be
ranker
to
Lucy
Morris
than
even
to
Mr.
Camperdown
or
Mrs.
Hittaway
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
refrain
from
say
a
word
even
to
old
Lady
Linlithgow
.
<EOS>
the
countess
have
call
her
niece
a
little
liar
.
"
<EOS>
liar
!
"
say
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
Satan
himself
can
lie
as
she
do
.
"
<EOS>
"
heighty
-
tighty
,
"
say
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
then
,
there
be
to
be
a
match
between
Lady
Satan
and
her
cousin
Frank
?
"
<EOS>
"
They
can
do
as
they
like
about
that
,
"
say
Lucy
,
walk
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
then
come
the
paragraph
in
the
fashionable
evening
newspaper
;
after
that
,
the
report
of
the
examination
before
the
magistrate
,
and
then
certain
information
that
Lady
Eustace
be
about
to
proceed
to
Scotland
together
with
her
cousin
Mr.
Greystock
,
the
Member
for
Bobsborough
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
large
income
,
"
say
the
countess
;
"
but
,
upon
my
word
,
she
be
dear
at
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
do
not
speak
,
but
she
bite
her
lip
till
the
blood
run
into
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
down
to
Fawn
Court
almost
immediately
,
to
stay
there
with
her
old
friend
till
she
should
be
able
to
find
some
permanent
home
for
herself
.
<EOS>
once
,
and
once
only
,
would
she
endure
discussion
,
and
then
the
matter
should
be
banish
for
ever
from
her
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
early
on
the
appoint
morning
Frank
Greystock
,
with
a
couple
of
cab
,
be
at
Mrs.
Carbuncle
's
door
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
have
agree
to
start
by
a
very
early
train
,
 
at
eight
a.m.
,
 
so
that
she
may
get
through
to
Portray
in
one
day
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
think
expedient
,
both
by
herself
and
by
her
cousin
,
that
for
the
present
there
should
be
no
more
sleeping
at
the
Carlisle
hotel
.
<EOS>
the
robbery
be
probably
still
talk
about
in
that
establishment
;
and
the
report
of
the
proceeding
at
the
police
-
court
have
,
no
doubt
,
travel
as
far
north
as
the
border
city
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
a
long
day
,
and
could
hardly
be
other
than
sad
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
understand
this
,
feel
that
though
she
have
be
in
a
great
measure
triumphant
over
her
difficulty
before
the
magistrate
,
she
ought
still
to
consider
herself
,
for
a
short
while
,
as
be
under
a
cloud
,
creep
down
into
the
cab
and
seat
herself
beside
her
cousin
almost
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
She
be
again
dress
in
black
,
and
again
wear
the
thick
veil
.
<EOS>
Her
maid
,
with
the
luggage
,
follow
them
,
and
they
be
drive
to
Euston
Square
almost
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
no
tall
footman
accompany
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Frank
;
dear
Frank
,
"
she
have
say
,
and
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
active
about
the
luggage
and
useful
in
give
order
;
 
but
beyond
his
direction
and
inquiry
as
to
the
journey
,
he
speak
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
have
she
breakfast
?
<EOS>
Would
she
have
a
cup
of
tea
at
the
station
?
<EOS>
Should
he
take
any
luncheon
for
her
?
<EOS>
at
every
question
she
only
look
into
his
face
and
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
all
thought
as
to
creature
-
comfort
be
over
with
her
now
for
ever
.
<EOS>
tranquillity
,
a
little
poetry
,
and
her
darling
boy
,
be
all
that
she
need
for
the
short
remainder
of
her
sojourn
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
sentiment
which
she
intend
to
convey
when
she
shake
her
head
and
look
up
into
his
eye
.
<EOS>
the
world
be
over
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
have
her
day
of
pleasure
,
and
find
how
vain
it
be
.
<EOS>
now
she
would
devote
herself
to
her
child
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
see
my
boy
again
to
-
night
,
"
she
say
,
as
she
take
her
seat
in
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
state
of
mind
,
or
such
,
<EOS>
rather
,
the
resolution
,
with
which
she
commence
her
journey
.
<EOS>
Should
he
become
bright
,
communicative
,
and
pleasant
,
or
even
tenderly
silent
,
or
,
perhaps
,
now
at
length
affectionate
and
demonstrative
,
she
,
no
doubt
,
may
be
able
to
change
as
he
change
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
cousinly
,
but
gloomy
,
at
the
police
-
court
;
in
the
same
mood
when
he
bring
her
home
;
and
,
as
she
see
with
the
first
glance
of
her
eye
,
in
the
same
mood
again
when
she
meet
him
in
the
hall
this
morning
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
must
play
his
tune
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
the
fate
of
woman
to
play
the
tune
which
man
dictate
,
 
except
in
some
rare
case
in
which
the
woman
can
make
herself
the
dictator
?
<EOS>
Lizzie
love
to
be
a
dictator
;
but
at
the
present
moment
she
know
that
circumstance
be
against
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
watch
him
,
 
so
closely
.
<EOS>
at
first
he
sleep
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
He
be
never
in
bed
very
early
,
and
on
this
morning
have
be
up
at
six
.
<EOS>
at
Rugby
he
get
out
and
eat
what
he
say
be
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Would
not
she
have
a
cup
of
tea
?
<EOS>
again
she
shake
her
head
and
smile
.
<EOS>
She
smile
as
some
woman
smile
when
you
offer
them
a
third
glass
of
champagne
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
joke
with
me
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
that
I
would
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
meaning
of
Lizzie
's
smile
.
<EOS>
He
go
into
the
refreshment
-
room
,
growl
at
the
heat
of
the
tea
and
the
abominable
nastiness
of
the
food
provide
,
and
then
,
after
the
allot
five
minute
,
take
himself
to
a
smoking
-
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
rejoin
his
cousin
till
they
be
at
Crewe
.
<EOS>
when
he
go
back
to
his
old
seat
,
she
only
smile
again
.
<EOS>
He
ask
her
whether
she
have
sleep
,
and
again
she
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
repeat
to
herself
the
address
to
Ianthe
's
soul
,
and
her
whole
being
be
pervade
with
poetry
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
absolutely
necessary
,
as
he
think
,
that
she
should
eat
something
,
and
he
insist
that
she
should
dine
upon
the
road
,
somewhere
.
<EOS>
He
,
of
course
,
be
not
aware
that
she
have
be
nibble
biscuit
and
chocolate
while
he
have
be
smoke
,
and
have
have
recourse
even
to
the
comfort
of
a
sherry
-
flask
which
she
carry
in
her
dressing
-
bag
.
<EOS>
when
he
talk
of
dinner
she
do
more
than
smile
and
refuse
.
<EOS>
She
expostulate
.
<EOS>
for
she
well
know
that
the
twenty
minute
for
dinner
be
allow
at
the
Carlisle
station
;
and
even
if
there
have
be
no
chocolate
and
no
sherry
,
she
would
have
endure
on
,
even
up
to
absolute
inanition
,
rather
than
step
out
upon
this
well
-
remember
platform
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
eat
,
or
you
will
be
starve
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
fetch
you
something
.
"
<EOS>
so
he
bribe
a
special
waiter
,
and
she
be
supply
with
cold
chicken
and
more
sherry
.
<EOS>
after
this
Frank
smoke
again
,
and
do
not
reappear
till
they
have
reach
dumfrie
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
there
have
be
no
tenderness
,
 
nothing
but
the
cold
cousinship
.
<EOS>
He
clearly
mean
her
to
understand
that
he
have
submit
to
the
task
of
accompany
her
back
to
Portray
Castle
as
a
duty
,
but
that
he
have
nothing
to
say
to
one
who
have
so
misbehave
herself
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
irritating
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
take
herself
home
to
Portray
without
his
company
,
and
have
make
the
journey
more
endurable
without
him
than
with
him
,
if
this
be
to
be
his
conduct
throughout
.
<EOS>
They
have
have
the
carriage
to
themselves
all
the
way
from
Crewe
to
Carlisle
,
and
he
have
hardly
speak
a
word
to
her
.
<EOS>
if
he
would
have
rate
her
soundly
for
her
wickedness
,
she
could
have
make
something
of
that
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
throw
herself
on
her
knee
,
and
implore
his
pardon
;
or
,
if
hard
pressed
,
have
suggest
the
propriety
of
throw
herself
out
of
the
carriage
-
window
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
bring
him
round
if
he
would
only
have
talk
to
her
,
but
there
be
no
do
anything
with
a
silent
man
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
her
master
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
power
over
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
lady
of
Portray
,
and
he
could
not
interfere
with
her
.
<EOS>
if
he
intend
to
be
sullen
with
her
to
the
end
,
and
to
show
his
contempt
for
her
,
she
would
turn
against
him
.
<EOS>
"
the
worm
will
turn
,
"
she
say
to
herself
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
do
not
think
herself
a
worm
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
station
beyond
dumfrie
they
be
again
alone
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
quite
dark
,
and
they
have
already
be
travel
over
ten
hour
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
reach
their
own
station
till
eight
,
and
then
again
there
would
be
the
journey
to
Portray
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
speak
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
be
you
tired
,
Lizzie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
so
tired
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
sleep
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
once
;
not
a
wink
.
<EOS>
You
have
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
this
she
say
in
a
tone
of
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
endeavour
to
read
,
but
one
can
not
command
one
's
mind
at
all
time
.
<EOS>
oh
,
I
be
so
weary
.
<EOS>
be
it
much
further
?
<EOS>
I
have
lose
all
reckon
as
to
time
and
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
change
at
the
next
station
but
one
.
<EOS>
It
will
soon
be
over
now
.
<EOS>
Will
you
have
a
glass
of
sherry
?
<EOS>
I
have
some
in
my
flask
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
again
she
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
long
way
down
to
Portray
,
I
must
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
be
so
sorry
that
I
have
give
you
the
trouble
to
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
think
of
myself
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
it
.
<EOS>
It

She

Frank
,
I
do

<EOS>
"
there
be
no

as
she

it
every

of
fatigue
pass
away
from
her

draw
off

when

be
dead

there
it
will
be

talk
about

want
to
give
it
you
;
 
yes
,
all
that
I
have
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
know
what
be
the
real
meaning
of
my
husband
's
will
,
my
only
thought
be
to
be
of
assistance
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
real
truth
Frank
be
become
very
sick
of
her
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
now
to
have
be
almost
impossible
that
he
should
ever
soberly
have
think
of
make
her
his
wife
.
<EOS>
the
charm
be
all
go
,
and
even
her
prettiness
have
in
his
eye
lose
its
value
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
her
,
ask
himself
whether
in
truth
she
be
pretty
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
travel
all
day
,
and
perhaps
the
scrutiny
be
not
fair
.
<EOS>
but
he
think
that
even
after
the
long
day
's
journey
Lucy
would
not
have
be
soil
,
haggard
,
dishevel
,
and
unclean
,
as
be
this
woman
.
  
<EOS>
traveller
again
enter
the
carriage
,
and
they
go
on
with
a
crowd
of
person
till
they
reach
the
platform
at
which
they
change
the
carriage
for
Troon
.
<EOS>
then
they
be
again
alone
,
for
a
few
minute
,
and
Lizzie
with
infinite
courage
determine
that
she
would
make
her
last
attempt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
,
"
she
say
,
"
you
know
what
it
be
that
I
mean

You
can
not
feel
that
I

ungenerous

You
have
make
me
love
you

Will
you
have
all
that
I
have
to
give
?
<EOS>
"
She
be
lean
over
,
close
to
him
,
and
he
be
observe
that
her
long
lock
of
hair
be
out
of
curl
and
untidy
,
 
a
thing
that
ought
not
to
have
be
there
during
such
a
journey
as
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
not
know
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
I
be
engage
to
marry
Lucy
Morris

<EOS>
"
no
;
 
I
do
not

have
tell
you
so
more
than
once

<EOS>
"
You
can
not
afford
to
marry
her

<EOS>
"
then
I
shall
do
it
without
afford
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
be
about
to
speak
,
 
have
already
pronounce
her
rival
's
name
in
that
tone
of
contempt
which
she
so
well
know
how
to
use
,
when
he
stop
her
.
"
do
not
say
anything
against
her
,
Lizzie
,
in
my
hearing
,
for
I
will
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
force
me
to
leave
you
at
the
Troon
station
,
and
I
have
better
see
you
now
to
the
end
of
the
journey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
fling
herself
back
into
the
corner
of
her
carriage
,
and
do
not
utter
another
word
till
she
reach
Portray
Castle
.
<EOS>
He
hand
her
out
of
the
railway
carriage
,
and
into
her
own
vehicle
which
be
wait
for
them
,
attend
to
the
maid
,
and
get
the
luggage
;
but
still
she
do
not
speak
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
that
she
should
quarrel
with
him
.
<EOS>
that
little
snake
,
Lucy
,
would
of
course
now
tell
him
of
the
meeting
between
them
in
Hertford
Street
,
after
which
anything
but
quarrelling
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
what
a
fool
the
man
must
be
,
what
an
idiot
,
what
a
soft
-
hearted
,
mean
-
spirited
fellow
!
<EOS>
Lucy
,
by
her
sly
,
quiet
little
stratagem
,
have
get
him
once
to
speak
the
word
,
and
now
he
have
not
courage
enough
to
go
back
from
it
!
<EOS>
He
have
less
strength
of
will
even
than
Lord
Fawn
!
<EOS>
what
she
offer
to
him
would
be
the
making
of
him
.
<EOS>
with
his
position
,
his
seat
in
Parliament
,
such
a
country
house
as
Portray
Castle
,
and
the
income
which
she
would
give
him
,
there
be
nothing
that
he
may
not
reach
!
<EOS>
and
he
be
so
infirm
of
purpose
,
that
though
he
have
hanker
after
it
all
,
he
would
not
open
his
hand
to
take
it
,
 
because
he
be
afraid
of
such
a
little
thing
as
Lucy
Morris
!
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
she
think
of
him
as
she
lean
back
in
the
carriage
without
speak
.
<EOS>
in
give
her
all
that
be
due
to
her
,
we
must
acknowledge
that
she
have
less
feeling
of
the
injury
do
to
her
charm
as
a
woman
than
may
have
be
expect
.
<EOS>
that
she
hate
Lucy
be
a
matter
of
course
;
 
and
equally
so
that
she
should
be
very
angry
with
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
but
the
anger
arise
from
general
disappointment
,
rather
than
from
any
sense
of
her
own
despised
beauty
.
"
<EOS>
ah
,
now
I
shall
see
my
child
,
"
she
say
,
as
the
carriage
stop
at
the
castle
-
gate
.
  
<EOS>
when
Frank
Greystock
go
to
his
supper
,
Miss
Macnulty
bring
to
him
his
cousin
's
compliment
with
a
message
say
that
she
be
too
weary
to
see
him
again
that
night
.
<EOS>
the
message
have
be
intend
to
be
curt
and
uncourteous
,
but
Miss
Macnulty
have
soften
it
,
 
so
that
no
harm
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
very
weary
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
though
that
nothing
would
ever
really
tire
Lady
Eustace
,
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
.
<EOS>
"
when
she
be
excite
nothing
will
tire
her
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
journey
have
be
dull
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
exceedingly
dull
,
"
say
Frank
,
as
he
help
himself
to
the
collop
which
the
Portray
cook
have
prepare
for
his
supper
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
be
very
attentive
to
him
,
and
have
many
question
to
ask
.
<EOS>
about
the
necklace
she
hardly
dare
to
speak
,
merely
observe
how
sad
it
be
that
all
those
precious
diamond
should
have
be
lose
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
sad
indeed
,
"
say
Frank
with
his
mouth
full
.
<EOS>
She
then
go
on
to
the
marriage
,
 
the
marriage
that
be
no
marriage
.
<EOS>
be
not
that
very
dreadful
?
<EOS>
be
it
true
that
Miss
Roanoke
be
really
 
out
of
her
mind
?
<EOS>
Frank
acknowledge
that
it
be
dreadful
,
but
think
that
the
marriage
have
it
be
complete
would
have
be
more
so
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
young
lady
,
he
only
know
that
she
have
be
take
somewhere
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Sir
Griffin
,
he
have
be
tell
,
have
go
to
Japan
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
Japan
!
"
say
Miss
Macnulty
,
really
interested
.
<EOS>
have
Sir
Griffin
go
no
further
than
Boulogne
,
her
pleasure
in
the
news
would
certainly
have
be
much
less
.
<EOS>
then
she
ask
some
single
question
about
Lord
George
,
and
from
that
come
to
the
real
marrow
of
her
anxiety
.
<EOS>
have
Mr.
Greystock
lately
see
the
 
the
Rev.
Mr.
Emilius
?
<EOS>
Frank
have
not
see
the
clergyman
,
and
could
only
say
of
him
that
have
Lucinda
Roanoke
and
Sir
Griffin
Tewett
be
make
one
,
the
knot
would
have
be
tie
by
Mr.
Emilius
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
it
indeed
?
<EOS>
do
you
not
think
Mr.
Emilius
very
clever
when
you
meet
him
down
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
but
<EOS>
what
he
be
a
sharp
sort
of
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Greystock
,
I
do
not
think
that
that
be
the
word
for
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
do
promise
me
when
he
be
here
that
he
would
write
to
me
occasionally
,
but
I
suppose
that
the
increase
duty
of
his
position
have
render
that
impossible
.
"
<EOS>
Frank
,
who
have
no
idea
of
the
extent
of
the
preacher
's
ambition
,
assure
Miss
Macnulty
that
among
his
multifarious
clerical
labour
it
be
out
of
the
question
that
Mr.
Emilius
should
find
time
to
write
letter
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
have
consent
to
stay
one
day
at
Portray
,
and
do
not
now
like
to
run
away
without
again
see
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
though
much
tempt
to
go
at
once
,
he
do
stay
the
day
,
and
have
an
opportunity
of
speak
a
few
word
to
Mr.
Gowran
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gowran
be
very
gracious
,
but
say
nothing
of
his
journey
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
He
ask
various
question
concern
her
"
leddyship
's
"
appearance
at
the
police
-
court
,
as
to
which
tiding
have
already
reach
Ayrshire
,
and
pretend
to
be
greatly
shock
at
the
loss
of
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
"
when
they
talk

Andy
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

Greystock

<EOS>
"
and
her
leddyship
wad
tak

aboot
wi
'
her
ten
thoosand
poond
 
in
a
box
?
"
<EOS>
Andy
still
show
much
doubt
by
the
angry
glance
of
his
eye
and
the
close
compression
of
his
lip
,
and
the
great
severity
of
his
demeanour
as
he
ask
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
diamond
myself
,
but
that
be
what
they
say
they
be
worth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her

nae

be
in
ain
story
aboot
the
box
,
Muster
Greystock
?
"
<EOS>
but
Frank
could
not
stand
to
be
cross
-
question
on
this
delicate
matter
,
and
walk
off
,
say
that
as
the
thief
have
not
yet
be
try
for
the
robbery
,
the
less
say
about
it
the
well
.
  
<EOS>
at
four
o'clock
on
that
afternoon
he
have
not
see
Lizzie
,
and
then
he
receive
a
message
from
her
to
the
effect
that
she
be
still
so
unwell
from
the
fatigue
of
her
journey
that
she
could
bear
no
one
with
her
but
her
child
.
<EOS>
She
hope
that
her
cousin
be
quite
comfortable
,
and
that
she
may
be
able
to
see
him
after
breakfast
on
the
follow
day
.
<EOS>
but
Frank
be
determined
to
leave
Portray
very
early
on
the
follow
day
,
and
therefore
write
a
note
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
He
beg
that
she
would
not
disturb
herself
,
that
he
would
leave
the
castle
the
next
morning
before
she
could
be
up
,
and
that
he
have
only
further
to
remind
her
that
she
must
come
up
to
London
at
once
as
soon
as
she
should
be
summon
for
the
trial
of
Mr.
Benjamin
and
his
comrade
.
<EOS>
It
have
seem
to
Frank
that
she
have
almost
conclude
that
her
labour
connect
with
that
disagreeable
matter
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
the
examination
may
be
long
,
and
I
will
attend
you
if
you
wish
it
,
"
say
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
upon
receive
this
she
think
it
expedient
to
come
down
to
him
,
and
there
be
an
interview
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
her
own
little
sitting
-
room
look
out
upon
the
sea
.
<EOS>
She
have
form
a
project
,
and
at
once
suggest
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
if
she
find
herself
ill
when
the
day
of
the
trial
come
,
could
they
make
her
go
up
and
give
her
evidence
?
<EOS>
Frank
tell
her
that
they
could
,
and
that
they
would
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
clever
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
They
could
not
go
back
to
what
I
say
at
Carlisle
,
you
know
;
because
they
already
have
make
me
tell
all
that
myself
.
"
<EOS>
as
she
have
be
call
upon
to
criminate
herself
,
she
could
not
now
be
try
for
the
crime
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
however
,
would
not
listen
to
this
,
and
tell
her
that
she
must
come
.
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
like
to
have
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
You
always
do
.
<EOS>
and
you
think
so
little
of
my
feeling
!
<EOS>
I
shall
make
inquiry
,
and
if
I

It
have
not

bad
at
all

only
that
there
be
nothing
particular
to

<EOS>
but
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
I
shall
get
another
place
as
a
governess
somewhere
,
and
that
will
suit

because
of
the

almost
indignant
in
her
denial

<EOS>
She
have
earn
nothing

it
be
in

that
the
old

clean

he
be

He
ought
not

have
make
such
a
mistake

that
be
quite
true

but
I
do
not
wish
him
to
be
unhappy
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
bad
,
but
she
be
very
bad
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
for
world
that
anybody
should
tell
him
that
he
owe
me
anything
;
but
if
he
could
be
save
from
her
,
 
<EOS>
oh
,
I
should
be
so
-
glad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
have
my
money

then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no

Lady
Linlithgow

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
better

<EOS>
It
be
honestly
your

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
take
it
,
thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
may
as
well
put
it
up
again
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
countess
replace
the
note
in
her
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
when
this
conversation
take
place
,
Frank
Greystock
be
travel
back
alone
from
Portray
to
London
.
<EOS>
on
the
same
day
the
Fawn
carriage
come
to
fetch
Lucy
away
.
<EOS>
as
Lucy
be
in
peculiar
distress
,
Lady
Fawn
would
not
allow
her
to
come
by
any
other
conveyance
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
exactly
think
that
the
carriage
would
console
her
poor
favourite
;
but
she
do
it
as
she
would
have
order
something
specially
nice
to
eat
for
any
one
who
have
break
his
leg
.
<EOS>
Her
soft
heart
have
compassion
for
misery
,
though
she
would
sometimes
show
her
sympathy
by
strange
expression
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
be
almost
angry
about
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
many
carriage
and
<EOS>
how
many
horse
do
Lady
Fawn
keep
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
carriage
and
two
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
fond
of
send
them
up
into
the
street
of
London
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lucy
say
nothing
more
,
know
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
soften
the
heart
of
this
dowager
in
regard
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
but
she
kiss
the
old
woman
at
parting
,
and
then
be
take
down
to
Richmond
in
state
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
make
up
her
mind
to
have
one
discussion
with
Lady
Fawn
about
her
engagement
,
 
the
engagement
which
be
no
longer
an
engagement
,
 
and
then
to
have
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
ask
Lady
Fawn
to
ask
the
girl
never
to
mention
Mr.
Greystock
's
name
in
her
hearing
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
also
make
up
her
mind
to
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
the
subject
should
be
mention
once
,
 
and
once
only
.
<EOS>
of
course
Lucy
must
have
another
place
,
but
there
need
be
no
hurry
about
that
.
<EOS>
She
fully
recognise
her
young
friend
's
feeling
of
independence
,
and
be
herself
aware
that
she
would
be
wrong
to
offer
to
the
girl
a
permanent
home
among
her
own
daughter
,
and
therefore
she
could
not
abandon
the
idea
of
a
future
place
;
but
Lucy
would
,
of
course
,
remain
till
a
situation
should
have
be
find
for
her
that
would
be
in
every
sense
unexceptionable
.
<EOS>
there
need
,
however
,
be
no
haste
,
 
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
the
few
word
about
Frank
Greystock
must
be
speak
.
<EOS>
They
need
not
,
however
,
be
speak
quite
immediately
.
<EOS>
let
there
be
smile
,
and
joy
,
and
a
merry
ring
of
laughter
on
this
the
first
day
of
the
return
of
their
old
friend
.
<EOS>
as
Lucy
have
the
same
feeling
on
that
afternoon
,
they
do
talk
pleasantly
and
be
merry
.
<EOS>
the
girl
ask
question
about
the
Vulturess
,
 
as
they
have
hear
her
call
by
Lizzie
Eustace
,
 
and
laugh
at
Lucy
to
her
face
when
she
swear
that
,
after
a
fashion
,
she
like
the
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
like
anybody
,
then
,
"
say
Nina
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
do
not

"
say
Lucy
,
think
at
once
of
Lizzie
Eustace
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
plan
out
the
next
day
with
great
precision
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
Lucy
and
the
girl
be
to
spend
the
morning
in
the
old
school
-
room
,
so
that
there
may
be
a
general
explanation
as
to
the
doing
of
the
last
six
month
.
<EOS>
They
be
to
dine
at
three
,
and
after
dinner
there
should
be
the
discussion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will

o'clock
,
my

"
say
Lady
Fawn

,
in
the
breakfast
-
parlour
.
<EOS>
Lucy
know
well
why
her
presence
be
require
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
would
come
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
wise
to
get
it
over

have
do
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
at

.
<EOS>
nothing
be

on
that
day
in
the
way
of
instruction
;
but
there
be
much
of
half
-
jocose
acknowledgement
of
past
idleness
,
and
a
profusion
of
resolution
of
future
diligence
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
of
the
girl
be
go
to
commence
a
course
of
reading
that

,
and
suggestion
be
make
as
to
very
rigid
rule
as
to
the
talking
of
french
and
german
.
"
<EOS>
but
as
we
can
not
talk
German
,
"
say
Nina
,
"
we
should
simply
be
dumb
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
would
talk
High
Dutch
,
Nina
,
sooner
than
submit
to
that
,
"

of
the
sister

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
before

,
there

an
unanimous
expression
of
opinion
in
the
kitchen
that
the

the
fire
.
<EOS>
Lucy
be
as
white
as

such
a
sudden
shock
at
her
heart

but
which

put
on
this

as
a
testimony

"
say
Cecilia

<EOS>
Lucy

<EOS>
She

,
have
come

slyly

craftily
,
and
wickedly
,
in
Lady
Fawn
's
absence
;
or
would
Miss
Morris
brazen

<EOS>
Will

,
Mary
,
that
I
will

"
He

much
time

"
say
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>

"
say
Cecilia
.
<EOS>
Lucy
have
not
a
word
to

.
<EOS>
She
stand
for
a
minute
among
them
,
try
to
think
,
and
then
she
slowly
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
not
condescend
to
alter
her
dress
by
the
aid
of
a
single
pin
,
or
by
the
adjustment
of
a
ribbon
.
<EOS>
It
may
well
be
that
,
after
the
mingle
work
and
play
of
the
morning
,
her
hair
should
not
be
smooth
;
but
she
be
too
proud
to
look
at
her
hair
.
<EOS>
the
man
whom
she
have
love
,
who
have
love
her
but
have
neglect
her
,
be
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
would
surely
not
have
follow
her
thither
<EOS>
do
he
not
intend
to
make
reparation
for
his
neglect
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
use
no
art
with
him
;
 
nor
would
she
make
any
entreaty
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
,
after
all
,
he
have
the
courage
to
come
and
tell
her
,
in
a
manly
,
straightforward
way
,
that
the
thing
must
be
all
over
,
 
that
he
have
make
a
mistake
,
and
would
beg
her
pardon
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
there
should
be
no
word
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
quite
quiet
with
him
;
but
there
should
be
no
word
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
but
if
 
in
that
other
case
she
could
not
be
sure
of
her
behaviour
,
but
she
know
well
that
he
would
not
have
to
ask
long
for
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
as
for
her
dress
,
 
he
have
choose
to
love
her
in
that
frock
before
,
and
she
do
not
think
that
he
would
pay
much
attention
to
her
dress
on
the
present
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
She
open
the
door
very
quietly
and
very
slowly
,
intend
to
approach
him
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
but
in
a
moment
,
before
she
could
remember
that
she
be
in
the
room
,
he
have
seize
her
in
his
arm
,
and
be
shower
kiss
upon
her
forehead
,
her
eye
,
and
her
lip
.
<EOS>
when
she
think
of
it
afterwards
,
she
could
not
call
to
mind
a
single
word
that
he
have
speak
before
he
hold
her
in
his
embrace
.
<EOS>
It
be
she
,
surely
,
who
have
speak
first
,
when
she
beg
to
be
release
from
his
pressure
.
<EOS>
but
she
well
remember
the
first
word
that
strike
her
ear
.
"
<EOS>
Dearest
Lucy
,
will
you
forgive
me
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
could
only
answer
them
through
her
tear
by
take
up
his
hand
and
kiss
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
Lady
Fawn

back
with
the

,

to
take
his
seat
at

a
profusion
of
civility

<EOS>
everybody

badly
to
Lucy

except

altogether
forget
that
she

for
some
time
look
upon

as
a
traitor
,
and
have
make
up
her
mind
that
she
have
be
deceive
and
ill

use
.
<EOS>
all
the
Fawns
have
speak
of
him
,
in
Lucy
's
absence
,
in
the
hard
term
of
reproach
,
and
declare
that
he
be
not
fit
to
be
speak
to
by
any
decent
person
.
<EOS>
Lady
Fawn
have
know
from
the
first
that
such
a
one
as
he
be
not
to
be
trust
.
<EOS>
Augusta
have
never
like
him
.
<EOS>
Amelia
have
fear
that
poor
Lucy
Morris
have
be
unwise
,
and
too
ambitious

<EOS>
Georgina

it

<EOS>
Diana

that
it
be
a
great
shame
.
<EOS>
Lydia
be
sure
that
Lucy
be
a
great
deal
too
good
for
him
.
<EOS>
Cecilia
have
wonder
where
he
would
go
to
;
 
a
form
of
anathema
which
have
bring
down
a
rebuke
from
her
mother
.
<EOS>
and
Nina
have
always
hate
him
like
poison
.
<EOS>
but
now
nothing
be
too
good
for
him
.
<EOS>
an
unmarried
man
who
be
willing
to
sacrifice
himself
be
,
in
feminine
eye
,
always
worthy
of
ribbon
and
a
chaplet
.
<EOS>
among
all
these
fawn
there
be
as
little
selfishness
as
can
be
find
,
 
even
among
woman
.
<EOS>
the
lover
be
not
the
lover
of
one
of
themselves
,
but
of
their
governess
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
though
he
desire
neither
to
eat
nor
drink
at
that
hour
,
something
special
have
be
cook
for
him
,
and
a
special
bottle
of
wine
have
be
bring
out
of
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
all
his
sin
be
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
no
single
question
be
ask
as
to
his
gross
misconduct
during
the
last
six
month
.
<EOS>
no
pledge
or
guarantee
be
demand
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
there
he
be
,
in
the
guise
of
a
declared
lover
,
and
the
fatted
calf
be
kill
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
early
dinner
it
be
necessary
that
he
should
return
to
town
,
and
Lucy
obtain
leave
to
walk
with
him
to
the
station
.
<EOS>
to
her
thinking
now
,
there
be
no
sin
to
be
forgive
.
<EOS>
everything
be
,
and
have
be
,
just
as
it
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
have
any
human
being
hint
that
he
have
sin
,
she
would
have
defend
him
to
the
death
.
<EOS>
something
be
say
between
them
about
Lizzie
,
but
nothing
that
arise
from
jealousy
.
<EOS>
not
till
many
month
have
pass
do
she
tell
him
of
Lizzie
's
message
to
herself
,
and
of
her
visit
to
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
but
they
speak
of
the
necklace
,
and
poor
Lucy
shudder
as
she
be
tell
the
truth
about
those
false
oath
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
think
that
,
after
that
,
Lord
Fawn
be
right
,
"
she
say
,
look
round
at
her
lover
.
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
what
he
do
,
he
do
before
that
,
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
but
be
they
not
good
and
kind
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
plead
for
her
friend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
ever
anybody
so
well
treat
as
they
have
treat
me
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
,
sir
,
you
must
not
quarrel
with
Lord
Fawn
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
allow
it
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
walk
back
from
the
station
alone
,
almost
bewilder
by
her
own
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
that
evening
something
like
an
explanation
be
demand
by
Lady
Fawn
,
but
no
explanation
be
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
when
question
be
ask
about
his
silence
,
Lucy
,
half
in
joke
and
half
in
earnest
,
fire
up
and
declare
that
everything
have
be
as
natural
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
come
to
Lady
Linlithgow
's
house
.
<EOS>
Lady
Linlithgow
would
not
receive
him
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
she
have
be
impatient
,
but
then
that
have
be
her
fault
.
<EOS>
have
he
not
come
to
her
the
very
first
day
after
her
return
to
Richmond
?
<EOS>
when
Augusta
say
something
as
to
letter
which
may
have
be
write
,
Lucy
snub
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who
say
he
do
not
write
?
<EOS>
He
do
write
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
contented
,
why
should
you
complain
?
"
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
do
not
complain
,
"
say
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
then
question
be
ask
as
to
the
future
,
 
question
to
which
Lady
Fawn
have
a
right
to
demand
an
answer
.
<EOS>
what
do
Mr.
Greystock
propose
to
do
now
?
<EOS>
then
Lucy
break
down
,
sob
,
cry
,
triumphing
,
with
mingled
love
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
go
to
the
deanery
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
bring
with
him
a
little
note
to
her
from
his
mother
,
in
which
she
be
invite
to
make
the
deanery
at
Bobsborough
her
home
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
be
to
go
away
just
when
you
have
come
?
"
ask
Nina
.
  
<EOS>
"
stay
with
us
a
month
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Lady
Fawn
,
"
just
to
let
people
know
that
we
be
friend
,
and
after
that
the
deanery
will
be
the
good
home
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
arrange
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
It
nee
only
be
further
say
,
in
complete
the
history
of
Lucy
Morris
as
far
as
it
can
be
complete
in
these
page
,
that
she
do
go
to
the
deanery
,
and
that
there
she
be
receive
with
all
the
affection
which
Mrs.
Greystock
could
show
to
an
adopt
daughter
.
<EOS>
Her
quarrel
have
never
be
with
Lucy
personally
,
 
but
with
the
untoward
fact
that
her
son
would
not
marry
money
.
<EOS>
at
the
deanery
she
remain
for
fifteen
happy
month
,
and
then
become
Mrs.
Greystock
,
with
a
bevy
of
Fawn
bridesmaid
around
her
.
<EOS>
as
the
personage
of
a
chronicle
such
as
this
should
all
be
make
to
operate
backwards
and
forwards
on
each
other
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
,
it
would
have
be
desirable
that
the
chronicler
should
have
be
able
to
report
that
the
ceremony
be
celebrate
by
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
wedding
do
not
take
place
till
the
end
of
the
summer
,
and
as
Mr.
Emilius
at
that
time
never
remain
in
town
,
after
the
season
be
over
,
this
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
Dean
of
Bobsborough
,
assist
by
one
of
the
minor
canon
,
who
perform
the
service
.
   
<EOS>
the
trial
 
<EOS>
have
tell
the
tale
of
Lucy
Morris
to
the
end
,
the
chronicler
must
now
go
back
to
the
more
important
person
of
this
history
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
early
in
April
when
Lizzie
Eustace
be
take
down
to
Scotland
by
her
cousin
,
and
the
trial
of
Mr.
Benjamin
and
Mr.
Smiler
be
fix
to
take
place
at
the
Central
Criminal
Court
about
the
middle
of
<EOS>
May
early
in
May
the
attorney
for
the
prosecution
apply
to
Greystock
,
ask
him
whether
he
would
make
arrangement
for
his
cousin
's
appearance
on
the
occasion
,
inform
him
that
she
have
already
be
formally
summon
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
he
write
to
Lizzie
,
tell
her
what
she
have
better
do
,
in
the
kind
manner
,
 
as
though
there
have
be
no
cessation
of
their
friendly
intercourse
,
offer
to
go
with
her
into
court
,
 
and
name
an
hotel
at
which
he
would
advise
her
to
stay
during
the
very
short
time
that
she
need
remain
in
London
.
<EOS>
She
answer
this
letter
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
be
sorry
to
say
that
she
be
much
too
ill
to
travel
,
or
even
to
think
of
travel
.
<EOS>
such
be
her
present
condition
that
she
doubt
greatly
whether
she
would
ever
again
be
able
to
leave
the
two
room
to
which
she
be
at
present
confine
.
<EOS>
all
that
remain
to
her
in
life
be
to
watch
her
own
blue
wave
from
the
casement
of
her
dear
husband
's
castle
,
 
that
casement
at
which
he
have
love
to
sit
,
and
to
make
herself
happy
in
the
smile
of
her
child
.
<EOS>
a
few
month
would
see
the
last
of
it
all
,
and
then
,
perhaps
,
they
who
have
trample
her
to
death
would
feel
some
pang
of
remorse
as
they
think
of
her
early
fate
.
<EOS>
She
have
give
her
evidence
once
and
have
tell
all
the
truth
,
 
though
she
be
now
aware
that
she
nee
not
have
do
so
,
as
she
have
be
defraud
of
a
vast
amount
of
property
through
the
gross
negligence
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
She
be
advise
now
by
person
who
seem
really
to
understand
the
law
,
that
she
could
recover
the
value
of
the
diamond
which
her
dear
,
dear
husband
have
give
her
,
from
the
freeholder
of
the
parish
in
which
the
robbery
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
She
fear
that
her
health
do
not
admit
of
the
necessary
exertion
.
<EOS>
be
it
otherwise
<EOS>
she
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
recover
the
value
of
her
property
,
 
not
on
account
of
its
value
,
but
because
she
have
be
so
ill
-
treat
by
Mr.
Camperdown
and
the
police
.
<EOS>
then
she
add
a
postscript
to
say
that
it
be
quite
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
take
any
journey
for
the
next
six
month
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
nee
hardly
be
tell
that
Greystock
do
not
believe
a
word
of
what
she
say
.
<EOS>
He
feel
sure
that
she
be
not
ill
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
energy
in
the
letter
hardly
compatible
with
illness
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
make
her
come
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
do
not
intend
to
go
down
again
to
Scotland
to
fetch
her
,
 
and
even
have
he
do
<EOS>
so
he
could
not
have
force
her
to
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
go
to
the
attorney
concern
,
and
read
to
them
so
much
of
the
letter
as
he
think
fit
to
communicate
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
that
will
not
do
at
all
,
"
say
an
old
gentleman
at
the
head
of
the
firm
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
be
very
leniently
treat
,
and
she
must
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
manage
it
,
then
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
will
not
give
us
trouble
,
because
if
she
do
we
must
expose
her
,
"
say
the
second
member
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
not
even
send
a
medical
certificate
,
"
say
the
tyro
of
the
firm
,
who
be
not
quite
so
sharp
as
he
will
probably
become
when
he
have
be
a
member
of
it
for
ten
or
twelve
year
.
<EOS>
You
should
never
ask
the
ostler
whether
he
grease
his
oats
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
Frank
Greystock
be
not
exactly
in
the
position
of
the
ostler
;
but
he
do
inform
his
cousin
by
letter
that
she
would
lay
herself
open
to
all
manner
of
pain
and
penalty
if
she
disobey
such
a
summon
as
she
have
receive
,
unless
she
do
so
by
a
very
strong
medical
advice
,
back
by
a
medical
certificate
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
when
she
receive
this
,
have
two
string
to
her
bow
.
<EOS>
a
writer
from
Ayr
have
tell
her
that
the
summon
send
to
her
be
not
worth
the
paper
on
which
it
be
print
in
regard
to
a
resident
in
Scotland
;
 
and
she
have
also
get
a
doctor
from
the
neighbourhood
who
be
satisfied
that
she
be
far
too
ill
to
travel
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
pulmonary
debilitation
be
the
complaint
from
which
she
be
suffer
,
which
,
with
depressed
vitality
in
all
the
organ
,
and
undue
languor
in
all
the
bodily
function
,
would
be
enough
to
bring
her
to
a
speedy
end
if
she
so
much
as
thought
of
make
a
journey
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
a
certificate
to
this
effect
be
get
in
triplicate
.
<EOS>
one
copy
she
send
to
the
attorney
,
one
to
Frank
,
and
one
she
keep
herself
.
  
<EOS>
the
matter
be
very
pressing
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
be
consider
that
the
trial
could
not
be
postpone
till
the
next
sitting
at
the
Criminal
Court
,
because
certain
witness
in
respect
to
the
diamond
have
be
procure
from
Hamburg
and
Vienna
,
at
a
very
great
cost
;
they
be
actually
on
their
way
to
London
when
Lizzie
's
second
letter
be
receive
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
have
resolve
to
have
the
diamond
,
still
with
a
hope
that
they
may
be
restore
to
the
keeping
of
Messrs.
Garnett
,
there
to
lie
hide
and
unused
at
any
rate
for
the
next
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
the
diamond
have
be
trace
first
to
Hamburg
,
and
then
to
Vienna
;
 
and
it
be
to
be
prove
that
they
be
now
adorn
the
bosom
of
a
certain
enormously
rich
russian
princess
.
<EOS>
from
the
grasp
of
the
russian
princess
it
be
find
impossible
to
rescue
them
;
but
the
witness
who
,
as
it
be
hope
,
may
have
aid
Mr.
Camperdown
in
his
effort
,
be
to
be
examine
at
the
trial
.
  
<EOS>
a
confidential
clerk
be
send
down
to
Portray
,
but
the
confidential
clerk
altogether
fail
in
make
his
way
into
Lizzie
's
presence
.
<EOS>
Word
be
bring
to
him
that
nothing
but
force
could
take
Lady
Eustace
from
her
bed
-
chamber
;
and
that
force
use
to
that
effect
may
take
her
out
dead
,
but
certainly
not
alive
.
<EOS>
He
make
inquiry
,
however
,
about
the
doctor
,
and
find
that
he
certainly
be
a
doctor
.
<EOS>
if
a
doctor
will
certify
that
a
lady
be
die
,
what
can
any
judge
do
,
or
any
jury
?
<EOS>
there
be
certain
statement
which
,
though
they
be
false
as
hell
,
must
be
treat
as
though
they
be
true
as
gospel
.
<EOS>
the
clerk
report
,
when
he
get
back
to
London
,
that
,
to
his
belief
,
Lady
Eustace
be
enjoy
an
excellent
state
of
health
;
 
but
that
he
be
perfectly
certain
that
she
would
not
appear
as
a
witness
at
the
trial
.
  
<EOS>
the
anger
feel
by
many
person
as
to
Lizzie
's
fraudulent
obstinacy
be
intense
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
think
that
she
ought
to
be
drag
up
to
London
by
cart
rope
.
<EOS>
the
attorney
engage
for
the
prosecution
be
almost
beside
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
do
send
down
a
doctor
of
their
own
,
but
Lizzie
would
not
see
the
doctor
,
 
would
not
see
the
doctor
though
threat
of
most
frightful
consequence
be
convey
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
expose
,
fine
thousand
of
pound
,
commit
to
gaol
for
contempt
of
court
,
and
prosecute
for
perjury
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
firm
.
<EOS>
She
write
one
scrap
of
a
note
to
the
doctor
who
come
from
London
,
"
I
shall
not
live
to
satisfy
their
rabid
vengeance
.
"
<EOS>
even
Frank
Greystock
feel
almost
more
annoyed
than
gratified
that
she
should
be
able
thus
to
escape
.
<EOS>
People
who
have
hear
of
the
inquiry
before
the
magistrate
,
have
postpone
their
excitement
and
interest
on
the
occasion
,
because
they
know
that
the
day
of
the
trial
would
be
the
great
day
;
and
when
they
hear
that
they
be
to
be
rob
of
the
pleasure
of
Lady
Eustace
's
cross
-
examination
,
there
arise
almost
a
public
feeling
of
wrath
that
justice
should
be
thus
outrage
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
who
have
give
the
certificate
be
vilify
in
the
newspaper
,
and
long
article
be
write
as
to
the
impotence
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
but
Lizzie
be
successful
,
and
the
trial
go
on
without
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
that
though
her
evidence
be
very
desirable
it
be
not
absolutely
essential
,
as
,
in
consequence
of
her
certify
illness
,
the
statement
which
she
have
make
at
the
police
-
court
could
be
bring
up
and
use
against
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
all
the
fact
of
the
robbery
be
,
moreover
,
prove
by
Patience
Crabstick
and
Billy
Cann
;
and
the
transfer
of
the
diamond
by
Mr.
Benjamin
to
the
man
who
recut
them
at
Hamburg
be
also
prove
.
<EOS>
many
other
morsel
of
collateral
evidence
have
also
be
pick
up
by
the
police
,
 
so
that
there
be
no
possible
doubt
as
to
any
detail
of
the
affair
in
Hertford
Street
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
rumour
that
Mr.
Benjamin
intend
to
plead
guilty
.
<EOS>
He
may
,
perhaps
,
have
do
so
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
for
the
absence
of
Lady
Eustace
;
but
as
that
be
think
to
give
him
a
possible
chance
of
escape
,
he
stand
his
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
absence
be
a
great
disappointment
to
the
sight
-
seer
of
London
,
but
nevertheless
the
court
be
crowd
.
<EOS>
It
be
understand
that
the
learn
serjeant
who
be
retain
on
this
occasion
to
defend
Mr.
Benjamin
,
and
who
be
assist
by
the
acute
gentleman
who
have
appear
before
the
magistrate
,
would
be
rather
severe
upon
Lady
Eustace
,
even
in
her
absence
;
and
that
he
would
ground
his
demand
for
an
acquittal
on
the
combine
fact
of
her
retention
of
the
diamond
,
her
perjury
,
and
of
her
obstinate
refusal
to
come
forward
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
know
that
he
could
be
very
severe
,
many
come
to
hear
him
,
 
<EOS>
and
they
be
not
disappointed
.
<EOS>
the
reader
shall
see
a
portion
of
his
address
to
the
jury
,
 
which
we
hope
may
have
have
some
salutary
effect
on
Lizzie
,
as
she
read
it
in
her
retreat
at
Portray
,
look
out
upon
her
own
blue
wave
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
gentleman
of
the
jury
,
let
me
recapitulate
to
you
the
history
of
this
lady
as
far
as
it
relate
to
the
diamond
as
to
which
my
client
be
now
in
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
You
have
hear
on
the
testimony
of
Mr.
Camperdown
that
they
be
not
her
at
all
,
 
that
,
at
any
rate
,
they
be
not
suppose
to
be
her
by
those
in
whose
hand
be
leave
the
administration
of
her
husband
's
estate
,
and
that
when
they
be
first
suppose
to
have
be
steal
at
the
inn
at
Carlisle
,
he
have
already
commence
legal
step
for
the
recovery
of
them
from
her
clutch
.
<EOS>
a
bill
in
Chancery
have
be
file
because
she
have
obstinately
refuse
to
allow
them
to
pass
out
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
prove
to
you
by
Lord
Fawn
that
though
he
be
engage
to
marry
her
,
he
break
his
engagement
because
he
suppose
her
possession
of
these
diamond
to
be
fraudulent
and
dishonest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
examination
have
be
terrible
to
the
unfortunate
Under
-
Secretary
;
 
and
have
absolutely
drive
him
away
from
the
India
Board
and
from
Parliament
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
prove
to
you
that
when
the
diamond
be
suppose
to
have
vanish
at
Carlisle
,
she
there
commit
perjury
.
<EOS>
that
she
do
so
she
herself
state
on
oath
in
that
evidence
which
she
give
before
the
magistrate
when
my
client
be
commit
,
and
which
have
,
as
I
maintain
,
improperly
and
illegally
be
use
against
my
client
at
this
trial
.
<EOS>
"
here
the
judge
look
over
his
spectacle
and
admonish
the
learned
serjeant
,
that
his
argument
on
that
subject
have
already
be
hear
,
and
the
matter
decide
.
<EOS>
"
true
,
my
lord
;
but
my
conviction
of
my
duty
to
my
client
compel
me
to
revert
to
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
commit
perjury
at
Carlisle
,
have
the
diamond
in
her
pocket
at
the
very
moment
in
which
she
swear
that
they
have
be
steal
from
her
.
<EOS>
and
if
justice
have
really
be
do
in
this
case
,
gentleman
,
it
be
Lady
Eustace
who
should
now
be
on
her
trial
before
you
,
and
not
my
unfortunate
client
.
<EOS>
well
,
 
what
be
the
next
that
we
hear
of
it
?
<EOS>
It
seem
that
she
bring
the
diamond
up
to
London
;
but
how
long
she
keep
them
there
,
nobody
know
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
necessary
to
account
for
them
.
<EOS>
a
robbery
be
get
up
between
a
young
woman
who
seem
to
have
be
the
confidential
friend
rather
than
the
maid
of
Lady
Eustace
,
and
that
other
witness
whom
you
have
hear
testify
against
himself
,
and
who
be
,
of
all
the
informer
that
ever
come
into
my
hand
,
the
most
flippant
,
the
most
harden
,
the
least
conscientious
,
and
the
least
credible
.
<EOS>
that
they
two
be
engage
in
a
conspiracy
I
can
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
that
Lady
Eustace
be
engage
with
them
,
I
will
not
say
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
ask
you
to
consider
whether
such
may
not
probably
have
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
she
then
perjure
herself
again
.
<EOS>
She
give
a
list
of
the
article
steal
from
her
,
and
omit
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
She
either
perjure
herself
a
second
time
,
 
or
else
the
diamond
,
in
regard
to
which
my
client
be
in
jeopardy
,
be
not
in
the
house
at
all
,
and
could
not
then
have
be
steal
.
<EOS>
It
may
very
probably
have
be
so
.
<EOS>
nothing
more
probable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
and
the
manager
of
the
Eustace
estate
have
gradually
come
to
a
belief
that
the
Carlisle
robbery
be
a
hoax
,
 
and
,
therefore
,
another
robbery
be
necessary
to
account
for
the
diamond
.
<EOS>
another
robbery
be
arrange
,
and
this
young
and
beautiful
widow
,
as
bold
as
brass
,
again
go
before
the
magistrate
and
swear
.
<EOS>
either
the
diamond
be
not
steal
,
or
else
again
she
commit
a
second
perjury
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
gentleman
,
she
be
not
here
.
<EOS>
She
be
sick
forsooth
at
her
own
castle
in
Scotland
,
and
send
to
us
a
medical
certificate
.
<EOS>
but
the
gentleman
who
be
carry
on
the
prosecution
know
their
witness
,
and
do
not
believe
a
word
of
her
sickness
.
<EOS>
have
she
the
feeling
of
woman
in
her
bosom
<EOS>
she
ought
indeed
to
be
sick
unto
death
.
<EOS>
but
they
know
her
better
,
and
send
down
a
doctor
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
You
have
hear
his
evidence
,
 
and
yet
this
wonderful
lady
be
not
before
us
.
<EOS>
I
say
again
that
she
ought
to
be
here
in
that
dock
,
 
in
that
dock
in
spite
of
her
fortune
,
in
that
dock
in
spite
of
her
title
,
in
that
dock
in
spite
of
her
castle
,
her
rich
,
her
beauty
,
and
her
great
relative
.
<EOS>
a
most
wonderful
woman
,
indeed
,
be
the
widow
Eustace
.
<EOS>
It
be
she
whom
public
opinion
will
convict
as
the
guilty
one
in
this
marvellous
mass
of
conspiracy
and
intrigue
.
<EOS>
in
her
absence
,
and
after
what
she
have
do
herself
,
can
you
convict
any
man
either
of
steal
or
of
dispose
of
these
diamond
?
"
<EOS>
the
vigour
,
the
attitude
,
and
the
indignant
tone
of
the
man
be
more
even
than
his
word
;
 
but
,
nevertheless
,
the
jury
do
find
both
Benjamin
and
Smiler
guilty
,
and
the
judge
do
sentence
them
to
penal
servitude
for
fifteen
year
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
end
of
the
Eustace
<EOS>
diamond
as
far
as
anything
be
ever
know
of
them
in
England
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Camperdown
altogether
fail
,
even
in
his
attempt
to
buy
them
back
at
something
less
than
their
value
,
and
be
ashamed
himself
to
look
at
the
figure
when
he
find
how
much
money
he
have
waste
for
his
client
in
their
pursuit
.
<EOS>
in
discuss
the
matter
afterwards
with
Mr.
Dove
,
he
excuse
himself
by
assert
his
inability
to
see
so
gross
a
robbery
perpetrate
by
a
little
minx
under
his
very
eye
without
interfere
with
the
plunder
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
she
be
,
"
he
say
,
"
from
the
moment
of
Sir
Florian
's
unfortunate
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
have
bring
a
little
harpy
into
the
family
,
and
I
be
oblige
to
declare
war
against
her
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
seem
to
be
of
opinion
that
the
ultimate
loss
of
the
diamond
be
upon
the
whole
desirable
,
as
regard
the
whole
community
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
have
have
the
case
settle
as
to
right
of
possession
,
"
he
say
,
"
because
there
be
in
it
one
or
two
point
of
interest
.
<EOS>
We
none
of
us
know
,
for
instance
,
what
a
man
can
,
or
what
a
man
can
not
,
give
away
by
a
mere
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
such
word
be
ever
speak
,
"
say
Mr.
Camperdown
in
wrath
.
  
<EOS>
"
such
evidence
as
there
be
would
have
go
to
show
that
it
have
be
speak
.
<EOS>
but
the
very
existence
of
such
property
so
to
be
dispose
of
,
or
so
not
to
be
dispose
of
,
be
in
itself
an
evil
.
<EOS>
thus
,
we
have
have
to
fight
for
six
month
about
a
lot
of
stone
hardly
so
useful
as
the
flag
in
the
street
,
and
then
they
vanish
from
us
,
leave
us
nothing
to
repay
us
for
our
labour
.
<EOS>
"
all
which
Mr.
Camperdown
do
not
quite
understand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dove
would
be
pay
for
his
labour
,
 
as
to
which
,
however
,
Mr.
Camperdown
know
well
that
no
human
being
be
more
indifferent
than
Mr.
Dove
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
much
sorrow
,
too
,
among
the
police
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
doubt
succeed
in
send
two
scoundrel
out
of
the
social
world
,
probably
for
life
,
and
have
succeed
in
avoid
the
reproach
which
a
great
robbery
,
unaccounted
for
,
always
entail
upon
them
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
sad
to
them
that
the
property
should
altogether
have
be
lose
,
and
sad
also
that
they
should
have
be
constrain
to
allow
Billy
Cann
to
escape
out
of
their
hand
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
sadness
may
have
be
lessen
to
a
certain
degree
in
the
breast
of
the
great
Mr.
Gager
by
the
charm
and
grace
of
Patience
Crabstick
,
to
whom
he
keep
his
word
by
make
her
his
wife
.
<EOS>
this
fact
,
 
or
rather
the
prospect
of
this
fact
,
as
it
then
be
,
 
have
also
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
learned
serjeant
,
and
,
in
his
hand
,
have
serve
to
add
another
interest
to
the
trial
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gager
,
when
examine
on
the
subject
,
do
not
attempt
to
deny
the
impeachment
,
and
express
a
strong
opinion
that
,
though
Miss
Crabstick
have
give
way
to
temptation
under
the
wile
of
the
Jew
,
she
would
make
an
honest
and
an
excellent
wife
.
<EOS>
in
which
expectation
let
us
trust
that
he
may
not
be
deceive
.
  
<EOS>
amusement
have
,
indeed
,
be
expect
from
other
source
which
fail
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Carbuncle
have
be
summon
,
and
Lord
George
;
but
both
of
them
have
leave
town
before
the
summon
could
reach
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
rumour
that
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
with
her
niece
,
have
go
to
join
her
husband
at
New
York
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
she
disappear
altogether
from
London
,
leave
behind
her
an
amount
of
debt
which
show
how
extremely
liberal
in
their
dealing
the
great
tradesman
of
London
will
occasionally
be
.
<EOS>
there
be
milliner
"
bill
which
have
be
run
for
three
year
,
and
horse
-
dealer
have
give
her
credit
year
after
year
,
though
they
have
scarcely
ever
see
the
colour
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
one
account
,
however
,
she
have
honestly
settle
.
<EOS>
the
hotel
-
keeper
in
Albemarle
Street
have
be
pay
,
and
all
the
tribute
have
be
pack
and
carry
off
from
the
scene
of
the
propose
wedding
banquet
.
<EOS>
what
become
of
Lord
George
for
the
next
six
month
,
nobody
ever
know
;
but
he
appear
at
Melton
in
the
follow
November
,
and
I
do
not
know
that
any
one
dare
to
ask
him
question
about
the
Eustace
diamond
.
  
<EOS>
of
Lizzie
,
and
her
future
career
,
something
further
must
be
say
in
the
conclude
chapter
of
this
work
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
our
heroine
,
and
we
must
see
her
through
her
immediate
trouble
before
we
can
leave
her
;
but
it
may
be
as
well
to
mention
here
,
<EOS>
that
although
many
threat
have
be
utter
against
her
,
not
only
by
Mr.
Camperdown
and
the
other
attorney
,
but
even
by
the
judge
himself
,
no
punishment
at
all
be
inflict
upon
her
in
regard
to
her
recusancy
,
nor
be
any
attempt
make
to
punish
her
.
<EOS>
the
affair
be
over
,
and
man
be
glad
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
trouble
themselves
further
with
the
business
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
a
case
would
be
get
up
with
the
view
of
prove
that
she
have
not
be
ill
at
all
,
and
that
the
Scotch
doctor
would
be
subject
to
the
loss
of
his
degree
,
or
whatever
privilege
in
the
healing
art
belong
to
him
;
 
but
nothing
be
do
,
and
Lizzie
triumph
in
her
success
.
   
<EOS>
once
More
at
Portray
 
<EOS>
on
the
very
day
of
the
trial
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
travel
from
London
to
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
the
trial
take
place
on
a
Monday
,
so
that
he
have
at
his
command
an
entire
week
before
he
would
be
require
to
appear
again
in
his
church
.
<EOS>
He
have
watch
the
case
against
Benjamin
and
Smiler
very
closely
,
and
have
know
beforehand
,
almost
with
accuracy
,
what
witness
would
appear
and
what
would
not
at
the
great
come
event
at
the
Old
Bailey
.
<EOS>
when
he
first
hear
of
Lady
Eustace
's
illness
,
he
write
to
her
a
most
affectionately
pastoral
letter
,
strongly
adjure
her
to
think
of
her
health
before
all
thing
,
and
assure
her
that
in
his
opinion
,
and
in
that
of
all
his
friend
,
she
be
quite
right
not
to
come
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
She
write
him
a
very
short
but
a
very
gracious
answer
,
thank
him
for
his
solicitude
,
and
explain
to
him
that
her
condition
make
it
quite
impossible
that
she
should
leave
Portray
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
anybody
know
how
ill
I
be
;
but
it
do
not
matter
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
go
,
they
will
know
what
they
have
do
.
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Emilius
resolve
that
he
would
go
down
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Lady
Eustace
be
not
as
ill
as
she
think
;
but
it
may
be
that
the
trial
,
and
the
hard
thing
lately
say
of
her
,
and
her
loneliness
,
and
the
feeling
that
she
need
protection
,
may
,
at
such
a
moment
as
this
,
soften
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
should
know
at
least
that
one
tender
friend
do
not
desert
her
because
of
the
evil
thing
which
man
say
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
to
Kilmarnock
,
think
it
better
to
make
his
approach
by
degree
.
<EOS>
be
he
to
present
himself
at
once
at
the
castle
and
be
refuse
admittance
,
he
would
hardly
know
how
to
repeat
his
application
or
to
force
himself
upon
her
presence
.
<EOS>
from
Kilmarnock
he
write
to
her
,
say
that
business
connect
with
his
ministration
during
the
come
autumn
have
bring
him
into
her
beautiful
neighbourhood
,
and
that
he
could
not
leave
it
without
pay
his
respect
to
her
in
person
.
<EOS>
with
her
permission
he
would
call
upon
her
on
the
Thursday
at
about
noon
.
<EOS>
He
trust
that
the
state
of
her
health
would
not
prevent
her
from
see
him
,
and
remind
her
that
a
clergyman
be
often
as
welcome
a
visitor
at
the
bedside
of
the
invalid
,
as
the
doctor
or
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
He
give
her
no
address
,
as
he
rather
wish
to
hinder
her
from
answer
him
,
but
at
the
appoint
hour
he
knock
at
the
castle
-
door
.
  
<EOS>
need
it
be
say
that
Lizzie
's
state
of
health
be
not
such
as
to
preclude
her
from
see
so
intimate
a
friend
as
Mr.
Emilius
?
<EOS>
that
she
be
right
to
avoid
by
any
effort
the
castigation
which
be
to
have
fall
upon
her
from
the
tongue
of
the
learned
serjeant
,
the
reader
who
be
not
straight
-
laced
will
be
dispose
to
admit
.
<EOS>
a
lone
woman
,
very
young
,
and
delicately
organise
!
<EOS>
how
could
she
have
stand
up
against
such
treatment
as
be
in
store
for
her
?
<EOS>
and
be
it
not
the
case
that
false
pretext
against
public
demand
be
always
hold
to
be
justifiable
by
the
female
mind
?
<EOS>
what
lady
will
ever
scruple
to
avoid
her
taxis
?
<EOS>
what
woman
ever
understand
her
duty
to
the
state
?
<EOS>
and
this
duty
which
be
require
of
her
be
so
terrible
,
that
it
may
well
have
reduce
to
falsehood
a
stouter
heart
than
her
own
.
<EOS>
It
can
hardly
be
reckon
among
Lizzie
's
great
sin
that
she
do
not
make
that
journey
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
an
appearance
of
sickness
she
do
maintain
,
even
with
her
own
domestic
.
<EOS>
to
do
as
much
as
that
be
due
even
to
the
doctor
whom
she
have
cajole
out
of
the
certificate
,
and
who
be
afterwards
frightened
into
maintain
it
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Emilius
be
her
clergyman
,
 
her
own
clergyman
,
as
she
take
care
to
say
to
her
maid
,
 
her
own
clergyman
,
who
have
come
all
the
way
from
London
to
be
present
with
her
in
her
sickness
;
and
of
course
she
would
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
do
not
think
much
of
the
come
autumnal
ministration
at
Kilmarnock
.
<EOS>
She
know
very
well
why
Mr.
Emilius
have
undertake
the
expense
of
a
journey
into
Scotland
in
the
middle
of
the
London
season
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
maim
fearfully
in
her
late
contest
with
the
world
,
and
be
now
lame
and
soiled
and
impotent
.
<EOS>
the
boy
with
none
of
the
equipment
of
the
skilled
sportsman
can
make
himself
master
of
a
wound
bird
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
be
seek
her
in
the
moment
of
her
weakness
,
fear
that
all
chance
of
success
may
be
over
for
him
<EOS>
should
she
ever
again
recover
the
full
use
of
her
wing
.
<EOS>
all
this
Lizzie
understand
,
and
be
able
to
measure
Mr.
Emilius
at
his
own
value
of
himself
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
again
,
she
be
force
to
ask
herself
what
be
her
value
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
terribly
maul
by
the
fowler
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
hit
,
so
to
say
,
on
both
wing
,
and
hardly
know
whether
she
would
ever
again
be
able
to
attempt
a
flight
in
public
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
live
alone
in
Portray
Castle
for
the
rest
of
her
day
.
<EOS>
Ianthe
's
soul
and
the
Corsair
be
not
,
in
truth
,
able
to
console
her
for
the
loss
of
society
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
somebody
to
depend
upon
;
 
ah
,
some
one
whom
,
if
it
be
possible
,
she
may
love
.
<EOS>
She
see
no
reason
why
she
should
not
love
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
shockingly
ill
-
treat
by
Lord
Fawn
,
and
the
Corsair
,
and
Frank
Greystock
.
<EOS>
no
woman
have
ever
be
so
knock
about
in
her
affection
.
<EOS>
She
pity
herself
with
an
exceed
pity
when
she
think
of
all
the
hardship
which
she
have
endure
.
<EOS>
leave
an
early
widow
,
persecute
by
her
husband
's
family
,
twice
rob
,
spy
upon
by
her
own
servant
,
unappreciate
by
the
world
at
large
,
ill
-
use
by
three
lover
,
victimise
by
her
select
friend
,
Mrs.
Carbuncle
,
and
now
drive
out
of
society
because
she
have
lose
her
diamond
,
be
she
not
more
cruelly
treat
than
any
woman
of
whom
she
have
ever
read
or
hear
?
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
go
to
give
up
the
battle
,
even
now
.
<EOS>
She
still
have
her
income
,
and
she
have
great
faith
in
income
.
<EOS>
and
though
she
know
that
she
have
be
grievously
wound
by
the
fowler
,
she
believe
that
time
would
heal
her
wound
.
<EOS>
the
world
would
not
continue
to
turn
its
back
altogether
upon
a
woman
with
four
thousand
pound
a
year
,
because
she
have
tell
a
fib
about
her
necklace
.
<EOS>
She
weigh
all
this
;
but
the
conviction
strong
upon
her
mind
be
the
necessity
that
she
should
have
a
husband
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
a
woman
by
herself
in
the
world
can
do
nothing
,
and
that
an
unmarried
woman
's
strength
lie
only
in
the
expectation
that
she
may
soon
be
marry
.
<EOS>
to
her
it
be
essentially
necessary
that
she
should
have
the
protection
of
a
husband
who
may
endure
on
her
behalf
some
portion
of
those
buffeting
to
which
she
seem
to
be
especially
doom
.
<EOS>
Could
she
do
better
with
herself
than
take
Mr.
Emilius
?
  
<EOS>
may
she
have
choose
from
all
the
world
,
Mr.
Emilius
be
not
,
perhaps
,
the
man
whom
she
would
have
select
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
indeed
,
attribute
in
the
man
,
very
objectionable
in
the
sight
of
some
people
,
which
to
her
be
not
specially
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
She
think
him
rather
good
-
look
than
otherwise
,
in
spite
of
a
slight
defect
in
his
left
eye
.
<EOS>
His
coal
-
black
,
glossy
hair
command
and
obtain
her
admiration
,
and
she
find
his
hooky
nose
to
be
handsome
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
think
much
of
the
ancestral
blood
of
which
he
have
boast
,
and
hardly
believe
that
he
would
ever
become
a
bishop
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
popular
,
and
with
a
rich
,
title
wife
,
may
become
more
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
and
Lady
Eustace
would
,
she
think
,
sound
very
well
,
and
would
surely
make
their
way
in
society
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
a
grasping
ambition
about
him
,
and
a
capacity
,
too
,
which
,
combine
,
would
enable
him
to
preach
himself
into
notoriety
.
<EOS>
and
then
in
marry
Mr.
Emilius
,
should
she
determine
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
she
may
be
sure
,
almost
sure
,
of
dictate
her
own
term
as
to
settlement
.
<EOS>
with
Lord
Fawn
,
with
Lord
George
,
or
even
with
her
cousin
Frank
,
there
would
have
be
much
difficulty
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
with
Mr.
Emilius
she
may
obtain
the
undisputed
command
of
her
own
income
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
quite
make
up
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
would
see
him
and
hear
what
he
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
Her
income
be
her
own
,
and
should
she
refuse
Mr.
Emilius
,
other
suitor
would
no
doubt
come
.
  
<EOS>
She
dress
herself
with
considerable
care
,
 
have
first
thought
of
receive
him
in
bed
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
trial
have
now
go
on
without
her
,
it
would
be
convenient
that
her
recovery
should
be
commence
.
<EOS>
so
she
have
herself
dress
in
a
white
morning
wrapper
with
pink
bow
,
and
allow
the
curl
to
be
make
fit
to
hang
over
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
and
she
put
on
a
pair
of
pretty
slipper
,
with
gilt
binding
,
and
take
a
laced
handkerchief
and
a
volume
of
Shelley
,
 
<EOS>
and
so
she
prepare
herself
to
receive
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
since
the
reader
first
know
her
,
have
begin
to
use
a
little
colouring
in
the
arrangement
of
her
face
,
and
now
,
in
honour
of
her
sickness
,
she
be
very
pale
indeed
.
<EOS>
but
still
,
through
the
paleness
,
there
be
the
faint
possible
tinge
of
pink
colour
shine
through
the
translucent
pearl
powder
.
<EOS>
any
one
who
know
Lizzie
would
be
sure
that
,
when
she
do
paint
,
she
would
paint
well
.
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
be
at
first
,
of
course
,
confine
to
the
lady
's
health
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
she
be
,
perhaps
,
get
well
,
though
,
as
the
doctor
have
tell
her
,
the
reassuring
symptom
may
too
probably
only
be
too
fallacious
.
<EOS>
She
could
eat
nothing
,
 
literally
nothing
.
<EOS>
a
few
grape
out
of
the
hothouse
have
support
her
for
the
last
week
.
<EOS>
this
statement
be
foolish
on
Lizzie
's
part
,
as
Mr.
Emilius
be
a
man
of
an
inquiring
nature
,
and
there
be
not
a
grape
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Her
only
delight
be
in
reading
and
in
her
child
's
society
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
think
that
she
would
pass
away
with
the
boy
in
her
arm
and
her
favourite
volume
of
Shelley
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
express
a
hope
that
she
would
not
pass
away
yet
,
for
ever
so
many
year
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
friend
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
"
what
be
life
,
that
one
should
desire
it
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
of
course
remind
her
that
,
though
her
life
may
be
nothing
to
herself
,
it
be
very
much
indeed
to
those
who
love
her
.
"
<EOS>
yes
;
 
to
my
boy
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
inform
her
,
with
confidence
,
that
it
be
not
only
her
boy
that
love
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
;
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
one
other
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
sure
of
one
faithful
heart
,
if
she
care
for
that
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
only
smile
,
and
throw
from
her
taper
finger
a
little
paper
pellet
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
 
probably
with
the
view
of
show
at
what
value
she
price
the
heart
of
which
Mr.
Emilius
be
speak
.
  
<EOS>
the
trial
have
occupy
two
day
,
Monday
and
Tuesday
,
and
this
be
now
the
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
the
result
have
be
telegraph
to
Mr.
Emilius
,
 
of
course
without
any
record
of
the
serjeant
's
bitter
speech
,
 
and
the
suitor
now
give
the
news
to
his
lady
-
love
.
<EOS>
those
two
horrid
man
have
at
last
be
find
guilty
,
and
punish
with
all
the
severity
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
poor
fellow
,
"
say
Lady
Eustace
,
 
"
poor
Mr.
Benjamin
!
<EOS>
those
ill
-
star
jewel
have
be
almost
as
unkind
to
him
as
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
never
come
back
alive
,
of
course
,
"
say
Mr.
Emilius
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
kill
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
it
will
kill
me
too
,
"
say
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
something
here
which
tell
me
that
I
shall
never
recover
.
<EOS>
nobody
will
ever
believe
what
I
have
suffer
about
those
paltry
diamond
.
<EOS>
but
he
covet
them
.
<EOS>
I
never
covet
them
,
Mr.
Emilius
;
though
I
cling
to
them
because
they
be
my
darle
husband
's
last
gift
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
assure
her
that
he
quite
understand
the
fact
,
and
appreciate
all
her
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
as
he
think
,
have
come
the
time
for
press
his
suit
.
<EOS>
with
widow
,
he
have
be
tell
,
the
wooing
should
be
brisk
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
once
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
,
and
of
course
she
know
the
motive
of
his
journey
to
Scotland
.
"
<EOS>
Dearest
Lady
Eustace
,
"
he
say
suddenly
,
"
may
I
be
allow
to
renew
the
petition
which
I
be
once
bold
enough
to
make
to
you
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
petition
!
"
exclaim
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
yes
;
I
can
well
understand
that
your
indifference
should
enable
you
to
forget
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
I
do
venture
to
tell
you
 
that
 
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Emilius
,
so
many
man
have
tell
me
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
well
believe
it
.
<EOS>
some
have
tell
you
so
,
perhaps
,
from
base
,
mercenary
motive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
complimentary
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
pay
you
any
compliment
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
our
future
intercourse
in
life
,
you
will
only
hear
word
of
truth
from
my
lip
.
<EOS>
some
have
tell
you
so
from
mercenary
motive
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
repeat
the
word
with
severity
,
and
then
pause
to
hear
whether
she
would
dare
to
argue
with
him
.
<EOS>
as
she
be
silent
,
he
change
his
voice
,
and
go
on
with
that
sweet
,
oily
tone
which
have
make
his
fortune
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
some
,
no
doubt
,
have
speak
from
the
inner
depth
of
their
heart
.
<EOS>
but
none
,
Lady
Eustace
,
have
speak
with
such
adamantine
truth
,
with
so
intense
an
anxiety
,
with
so
personal
a
solicitude
for
your
welfare
in
this
world
and
the
next
,
as
that
,
 
or
I
should
rather
say
those
,
 
which
glow
within
this
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
be
certainly
pleased
by
the
manner
in
which
he
address
her
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
a
man
ought
to
dare
to
speak
out
,
and
that
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
he
should
venture
to
do
so
with
some
enthusiasm
and
some
poetry
.
<EOS>
She
consider
that
man
generally
be
afraid
of
express
themselves
,
and
be
as
dumb
as
dog
from
the
want
of
become
spirit
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Emilius
gesticulate
,
and
strike
his
breast
,
and
bring
out
his
word
as
though
he
mean
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
easy
to
say
all
that
,
Mr.
Emilius
,
"
she
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
saying
of
it
be
hard
enough
,
Lady
Eustace
.
<EOS>
You
can
never
know
how
hard
it
be
to
speak
from
a
full
heart
.
<EOS>
but
to
feel
it
,
I
will
not
say
be
easy
;
 
only
to
me
,
not
to
feel
it
be
impossible

<EOS>
Lady
Eustace
,
my
heart
be
devoted
to
your
heart

seek
its
comrade

It
be
sick
with
love

will
not

It
force
from
me

will
return
upon
me
with
all
the
bitterness

over

<EOS>
She
have
never
be
make
love
to
after
this
fashion
before

<EOS>
She
know
,
or
half
know
,
that
the
man
be
a
scheming
hypocrite
,
crave
her
money
,
and
follow
her
in
the
hour
of
her
trouble

because
he
may

She
have
no

whatever
in
his

yet
she
like
it

She
like

recklessly

She
be
unfit

for
the
poor

when

have
hear
that

Mr.

a
vague

come
across

that
this
glow

have
a
taste
of
the
Bible
about
it

and
that
,
therefore
,
it
be
in
some
degree
impersonal

intend
to
be
pious

<EOS>
She
do
not
relish
piety
at
such
a
crisis

this
,
and
be
,
therefore
,
for
a
moment
incline
to
be
cold
.
<EOS>
but
she
like
be
call
a
flower
,
and
be
not
quite
sure
whether
she
remember
her
Bible
rightly
.
<EOS>
the
word
which
strike
her
ear
as
familiar
may
have
come
from
Juan
and
Haidee
,
and
if
so
,
nothing
could
be
more
opportune
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
expect
me
to
give
you
answer
now
,
Mr.
Emilius
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
 
now

and
he
stand
before
her
in
calm
dignity
,
with
his
arm
cross
upon
his
breast

<EOS>
She
do
give
him
his
answer
then
and
there
,
but
first
she
turn
her
face
to
the
wall
,
 
or
rather
to
the
back
of
the
sofa
,
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
delicious
moment
to
her
,
that
in
which
she
be
weep
.
<EOS>
She
sob
forth
something
about
her
child
,
something
about
her
sorrow
,
something
as
to
the
wretchedness
of
her
lot
in
life
,
something
of
her
widowed
heart
,
 
something
also
of
that
duty
to
other
which
would
compel
her
to
keep
her
income
in
her
own
hand

<EOS>
that
evening
she
think
it
proper
to
tell
Miss
Macnulty
what
have
occur
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
a
great
preacher
of
the
gospel
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
I
know
no
position
in
the
world
more
worthy
of
a
woman
's
fond
admiration

"
<EOS>
Miss
Macnulty
be
unable
to
answer
a
word

<EOS>
She
could
not
congratulate
her
successful
rival
,
even
though
her
bread
depend
on
it

<EOS>
She
creep
slowly
out
of
the
room
,
and
go
up
-
stair
,
and
weep
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
the
month
of
June
,
Lady
Eustace
be
lead
to
the
hymeneal
altar
by
her
clerical
bridegroom
.
<EOS>
the
wedding
take
place
at
the
episcopal
church
at
Ayr
,
far
from
the
eye
of
curious
Londoners
.
<EOS>
It
nee
only
be
further
say
that
Mr.
Emilius
could
be
persuade
to
agree
to
no
settlement
prejudicial
to
that
marital
supremacy
which
should
be
attach
to
the
husband
;
and
that
Lizzie
,
when
the
moment
come
,
know
that
her
betrothal
have
be
make
public
to
all
the
world
,
do
not
dare
to
recede
from
another
engagement
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
Mr.
Emilius
will
suit
her
as
well
as
any
husband
that
she
could
find
,
 
unless
it
shall
be
find
that
his
previous
career
have
be
too
adventurous
.
<EOS>
after
a
certain
fashion
he
will
,
perhaps
,
be
tender
to
her
;
but
he
will
have
his
own
way
in
everything
,
and
be
no
whit
afraid
when
she
be
about
to
die
in
an
agony
of
tear
before
his
eye
.
<EOS>
the
writer
of
the
present
story
may
,
however
,
declare
that
the
future
fate
of
this
lady
shall
not
be
leave
altogether
in
obscurity
.
   
<EOS>
what
be
say
about
It
all
at
match
 
<EOS>
the
Whitsuntide
holiday
be
late
this
year
,
not
take
place
till
the
beginning
of
June
,
and
be
protract
till
the
9th
of
that
month
.
<EOS>
on
the
8th
Lizzie
and
Mr.
Emilius
become
man
and
wife
,
and
on
that
same
day
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
entertain
a
large
company
of
guest
at
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
there
be
quite
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
in
these
day
Lady
Glencora
seldom
separate
herself
far
,
or
for
any
long
time
,
from
her
husband
's
uncle
,
 
do
her
duty
to
the
head
of
her
husband
's
family
in
the
most
exemplary
manner
.
<EOS>
People
indeed
say
that
she
watch
him
narrowly
,
but
of
person
in
high
station
common
people
will
say
anything
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
any
rate
certain
that
she
make
the
decline
year
of
that
great
nobleman
's
life
comfortable
and
decorous
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
be
also
at
Matching
,
a
lady
whose
society
always
give
gratification
to
the
duke
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Palliser
be
also
there
,
take
the
rest
that
be
so
needful
to
him
;
 
by
which
it
must
be
understand
that
after
have
work
all
day
,
he
be
able
to
eat
his
dinner
,
and
then
only
write
a
few
letter
before
go
to
bed
,
instead
of
attend
the
House
of
Commons
till
two
or
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
but
his
mind
be
still
deep
in
quint
and
semitenth
.
<EOS>
His
great
measure
be
even
now
in
committee
.
<EOS>
His
hundred
and
second
clause
have
be
carry
,
with
only
nine
division
against
him
of
any
consequence
.
<EOS>
seven
of
the
most
material
clause
have
,
no
doubt
,
be
postpone
,
and
the
great
bone
of
contention
as
to
the
two
superfluous
farthing
still
remain
before
him
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
fondly
hope
that
he
would
be
able
to
send
his
bill
complete
to
the
House
of
Lords
before
the
end
of
July
.
<EOS>
what
may
be
do
in
the
way
of
amendment
there
<EOS>
he
have
hitherto
refuse
to
consider
.
<EOS>
"
if
the
peer
choose
to
put
themselves
in
opposition
to
the
whole
nation
on
a
purely
commercial
question
,
the
responsibility
of
all
evil
that
may
follow
must
be
at
their
door
.
<EOS>
"
this
he
have
say
as
a
commoner
.
<EOS>
a
year
or
two
at
the
farth
,
 
or
more
probably
a
few
month
,
 
would
make
him
a
peer
;
and
then
,
no
doubt
,
he
would
look
at
the
matter
in
a
wholly
different
light
.
<EOS>
but
he
work
at
his
great
measure
with
a
diligence
which
at
any
rate
deserved
success
;
and
he
now
have
with
him
a
whole
bevy
of
secretary
,
private
secretary
,
chief
clerk
,
and
accountant
,
all
of
whom
Lady
Glencora
captivate
by
her
flattering
way
,
and
laugh
at
behind
their
back
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
be
there
with
his
wife

repeatedly
declare
to
all
his
friend
that
England
would
achieve
the
glory
of

coinage
by
his

and
over

Barrington

who
take

much
more

He

this
tickle
the

if
I

both

they

these

never

It

now

terribly

They
be
prince

great
power

it
be
quite
absurd

so
they
must
feel
it

<EOS>
I
have
often
think
about
that
a
good
deal

Glencora

a

a

We
hear
that
he
have
a
wife
in
Prague

probably
two

three

but
he
have
get
poor

Barrington
say

out

would
be
to
go

Prague
for
the
former

They

It
be
a
most

conclusion

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agree
with
you
,
Mr.
Bonteen
,
that
it
would
be
very
nice
to
send
the
brother
of
a
marquis
to
Botany
Bay
,
or
wherever
they
go
now
;
and
that
it
would
do
a
deal
of
good
to
have
the
widow
of
a
baronet
lock
up
in
the
Penitentiary
;
but
you
see
,
if
they
do
not
happen
to
be
guilty

it
would
be
almost
a
shame

punish
them

therefore
,
I

this
observation

as
for

do
anybody
mean

when

make
such
statement

no

She
have
attain

the
courage
