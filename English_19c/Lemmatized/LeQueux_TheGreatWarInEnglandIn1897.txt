with

the

Would

there

<EOS>
bewilder

the

<EOS>
only
slowly
do
the
vivid

terrible
truth
dawn
individually
upon

and
then

during
the
Day

they

,
loudly
clamour
for
further
detail
of

overwhelming
catastrophe

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
never

for
this

<EOS>
a

to

<EOS>
fierce

honour
.
<EOS>
heedless
of
danger
,
of
hardship
,
of
the
fickle
fortune
of
the
fight
,
the
determination
to
assist
in
the

within

<EOS>
all
be
enthusiastic

<EOS>
pluck
,
zeal
for
the

and
an
intense
partisanship
towards
their
fellow
induce
thousand
to
join
the

--
many
,
alas

<EOS>
to
sink
later
beneath
a
foeman

bullet
,
unknown
,
unhonoured
hero
!
 
<EOS>
already
the
Cabinet
have
hold
a
hurried
meeting
,
at
which
it
have
be
decide
to
call
out
the
whole
of
the
Reserves
.
<EOS>
of
this
the

and
the
Queen

give
her

to
the

<EOS>
the

which

of

Regimental

<EOS>
on

,
military

and
in

these

<EOS>
crowd
everywhere
collect

and
the

.
<EOS>
Militia
,
Yeomanry
,
Volunteers
,
all
be
call
out
,
and
man
on
read
the
mobilisation
order
lose
no
time
in
obtain
their
accoutrement
and
join
their
depot
.
<EOS>
the
national
danger
be
imminent
,
and
towards
their
"
place
of
concentration
"
all
category
of
Her
Majesty
's
force
be
already
move
.
<EOS>
in
every
Regimental
District
the
great
activity
be
display
.
<EOS>
no
country
maintain
in
peace
the
full
complement
,
or
anything
approach
the
full
complement
of
transport
which
its
army
require
;
<EOS>
hence
vehicle
and
horse
to
complete
the
Army
Service
Corps
company
,
and
for
the
supplemental
service
,
be
be
immediately
requisition
from
far
and
near
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
many
anomaly
discover
during
this
critical
period
be
,
that
while
transport
could
thus
be
rapidly
requisition
,
yet
the
impressment
of
civilian
as
driver
and
caretaker
of
the
animal
be
not
permit
by
the
law
;
therefore
on
all
hand
the
organisation
of
this
requisition
transport
be
fraught
with
the
utmost
difficulty
,
the
majority
of
owner
and
employee
refuse
to
come
forward
voluntarily
.
<EOS>
register
horse
be
quickly
collect
,
but
they
be
far
from
sufficient
for
the
requirement
,
and
the
want
of
animal
cause
loud
outcry
from
every
Regimental
District
.
 
<EOS>
the
general
scheme
be
the
constitution
of
a
Field
Army
of
four
cavalry
brigade
and
three
army
corp
,
with
behind
them
a
semi
-
mobile
force
make
up
of
thirty
-
three
Volunteer
infantry
brigade
and
eighty
-
four
Volunteer
battery
of
position
.
<EOS>
the
garrison
have
be
provide
for
<EOS>
,
the
four
cavalry
brigades
and
the
1st
and
2nd
Army
Corps
be
to
be
compose
entirely
of
regular
,
the
3rd
Army
Corps
be
make
up
of
Regulars
,
Militia
,
and
Volunteers
.
<EOS>
organise
in
brigade
,
the
Yeomanry
be
attach
to
the
various
infantry
brigade
or
division
of
the
Field
Army
,
and
the
Regular
Medical
Staff
Corps
be
much
too
weak
,
be
strengthen
from
company
of
the
Volunteer
Medical
Staff
Corps
.
<EOS>
in
brief
,
the
scheme
be
the
formation
of
a
composite
Field
Army
,
back
by
a
second
line
of
partially
train
Auxiliaries
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
general
scheme
to
set
in
battle
order
<EOS>
our
land
force
for
home
defence
be
,
no
doubt
,
well
devise
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
from
the
first
moment
the
most
glaring
defect
in
the
working
out
of
detail
be
everywhere
manifest
.
<EOS>
store
be
badly
dispose
,
there
be
a
sad
want
of
clothing
,
camp
equipment
,
and
arm
,
and
the
arrangement
for
the
joining
of
Reservists
be
throughout
defective
.
<EOS>
again
,
the
whole
Reserve
have
be
leave
totally
untrained
from
the
day
the
man
leave
the
colour
;
and
have
in
view
the
fact
that
all
lead
authority
in
Europe
have
,
time
without
number
,
tell
us
that
the
efficiency
of
an
Army
depend
on
drill
,
discipline
,
and
shooting
,
what
could
be
expect
from
a
system
which
rely
in
great
part
for
the
safety
of
the
country
on
a
Reserve
,
the
member
of
which
be
undisciplined
,
undrilled
,
and
unpractise
in
shoot
for
period
range
from
nine
year
in
the
Guards
to
five
year
in
the
case
of
the
line
?
 
<EOS>
on
the
day
of
mobilisation
not
a
single
regiment
in
the
United
Kingdom
be
ready
to
move
forward
to
the
front
as
it
stand
on
parade
!
<EOS>
not
an
officer
,
not
a
man
,
be
prepare
.
<EOS>
England
have
calmly
sleep
for
year
,
while
military
reform
have
be
effect
in
every
other
european
country
.
<EOS>
now
she
have
be
suddenly
and
rudely
awaken
!
 
<EOS>
everywhere
it
be
comment
upon
that
no
practical
peace
trial
of
the
mobilisation
scheme
have
ever
be
make
.
<EOS>
little
wonder
be
there
,
then
,
that
incomplete
detail
hamper
rapid
movement
,
or
that
the
carrying
out
of
the
definite
and
distinct
programme
be
prevent
by
gap
occur
which
could
not
be
discover
until
the
working
of
the
system
have
be
test
by
actual
experiment
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
this
past
apathy
of
the
authority
,
amount
to
little
less
than
criminal
negligence
,
<EOS>
that
form
the
text
of
the
vehement
outpouring
of
anarchist
,
Socialists
,
and
"
no
War
"
partisan
.
<EOS>
a
practical
test
of
the
efficiency
of
the
scheme
to
concentrate
our
force
should
have
take
place
even
at
the
risk
of
public
expenditure
,
instead
of
make
the
experiment
when
the
enemy
be
actually
at
our
door
.
 
<EOS>
another
anomaly
which

<EOS>
His
life
have
be
a
strangely
varied
one
;
few
man
perhaps
have
see
more
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
His
biography

<EOS>
but
the
Fickle
Goddess

last
forsook
him
,
and
under
another
name
he
start
a
bogus
loan
office
in
Brussels
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
do
not
last
long
,
for
the
police
one
night
make
a
raid
on
the
place
,
only
to
discover
that
Monsieur

<EOS>
an
extensive
robbery
of
diamond
in
Amsterdam
,
a
theft
of
bond
while
in
transit
between
Hanover
and
Berlin
,
and
the
forgery
of
a
large
quantity
of
russian
rouble
note
,
be
event
which
follow
in
quick
succession
,
and
in
each
of
them
the
police
detect
the
adroit
hand
of
the
man
who
now
call
himself
the
Count
von
Beilstein
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
by
sheer
ill
-
luck
,
he
fall
into
the
grip
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
St.
Petersburg
,
where
he
have
open
an
office
in
the
Bolshaia
,
and
start
as
a
diamond
dealer
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
genuine
transaction
he
obtain
possession
of
gem
worth
nearly
L20,000
,
and
decamp
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
russian
police
be
quickly
at
his
heel
,
and
he
be
arrest
in
Riga
,
be
subsequently
try
and
condemn
by
the
Assize
Court
at
St.
Petersburg
to
twelve
year

exile
in
Siberia
.
<EOS>
in
chain
,
with
a
convoy
of
convict
he
cross
the
Urals
,
and
tramp
for
week
on
the
snow
-
cover
Siberian
Post
Road
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
still
appear
on
the
register
at
the
forwarding
prison
of
Tomsk
,
with
a
note
state
that
he
be
send
on
to
the
silver
mine
of
Nertchinsk
,
the
most
dreaded
in
Asiatic
Russia
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
strangely
enough
,
within
twelve
month
of
his
sentence
he
appear
at
Royat
-
les
-
Bains
,
in
Auvergne
,
pose
as
a
Count
,
and
live
expensively
at
one
of
the
good
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
reason
for
all
this
.
<EOS>
the
russian
Government
,
when
he
be
sentence
,
be
well
aware
of
his
perfect
training
as
a
cosmopolitan
adventurer
,
of
his
acquaintance
with
person
of
rank
,
and
of
his
cool
unscrupulousness
.
<EOS>
hence
it
be
that
one
night
<EOS>
while
on
the
march
along
the
Great
Post
Road
to
that
bourne
whence
few
convict
return
,
it
be
hint
to
him
by
the
captain
of
Cossacks
,
that
he
may
obtain
his
liberty
,
and
a
good
income
in
addition
,
if
he
consent
to
become
a
secret
agent
of
the
Tsar
.
 
<EOS>
the
authority
desire
him
to
perform
a
special
duty
;
would
he
consent
?
<EOS>
He
could
exchange
a
life
of
heavy
toil
in
the
Nertchinsk
mine
for
one
of
comparative
idleness
and
ease
.
<EOS>
the
offer
be
tempt
,
and
he
accept
.
 
<EOS>
that
same
night
it
be
announce
to
his
fellow
-
convict
that
the
Tsar
have
pardon
him
;
his
leg
-
fetter
be
thereupon
strike
off
,
and
he
start
upon
his
return
to
St.
Petersburg
to
receive
instruction
as
to
the
delicate
mission
he
be
to
perform
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
he
become
the
Count
von
Beilstein
,
and
his
subsequent
action
all
betray
the
most
remarkable
daring
,
forethought
,
and
tact
.
<EOS>
with
one
object
in
view
he
exercise
an
amount
of
patience
that
be
almost
incredible
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
minor
mission
be
entrust
to
him
by
his
official
taskmaster
on
the
bank
of
the
Neva
,
and
in
each
he
acquit
himself
satisfactorily
.
<EOS>
apparently
he
be
a
thoroughly
patriotic
subject
of
the
Kaiser
,
with
taste
strongly
anti
-
muscovite
,
and
after
his
partnership
with
Sir
Joseph
Vayne
he
reside
in
London
,
and
mix
a
good
deal
with
military
man
,
because
he
have
,
he
say
,
hold
a
commission
in
a
Hussar
regiment
in
the
Fatherland
,
and
take
the
lively
interest
in
all
military
matter
.
 
<EOS>
little
do
those
officer
dream
that
the
information
he
gain
about
improvement
in
England
's
defence
be
forward
in
regular

carefully

these

which
british

<EOS>
yet
the

at

look
grave
,
and
although
affect
unconcern
,
now
and
then
whisper
ominously
together
.
<EOS>
They
know
that
the
situation
be
critical
.
<EOS>
an
immediate
and
adequate
naval
defence
be
just
possible
,
but
the
Channel
Squadron
be
manoeuvre
off
the
irish
coast
,
and
both
the
Coastguard
Squadron
and
the
Steam
Reserve
at
the
home
port
be
very
weak
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
our
land
army
that
we
have
to
trust
,
and
they
be
divide
in
opinion
as
to
the
possibility
to
mobilise
a
sufficient
force
in
time
to
bar
the
advance
.
 
<EOS>
military
expert
do
not
overlook
the
fact
that
to
Dunkirk
,
Calais
,
Boulogne
,
Dieppe
,
Fecamp
,
Havre
,
Honfleur
,
and
Cherbourg
run
excellent

with
ample

stock
,
all
Government
property
,
and
at

beck

call
of
the
French
War
Minister
.
<EOS>
in
the
various
port
there
be
adequate
wharf
accommodation
and
plenty
of
steam
tonnage
.
<EOS>
from
the
brief
official
despatch
receive
from
Paris
before
the
cutting
of
the
wire
,
it
be
apparent
that
the
French
War
Office
have
lay
its
plan
with
much
forethought
and
cunning
,
and
have
provide
against
any
_
contretemp
_
.
<EOS>
an
army
of
carpenter
and
engineer
have
be
put
to
work
in
the
port
to
alter
the
fitting
of
such
of
the
merchant
steamer
as
be
destine
to
convey
horse
,
and
these
fitting
,
prepare
beforehand
,
be
already
in
position
.
<EOS>
four
army
corps
have
for
several
week
be
manoeuvre
in
Normandy
,
so
that
the
Reservists
have
become
accustomed
to
their
work
,
and
in
excellent
condition
for
war
;
therefore
these
fact
,
couple
with
the
strong
support
certain
to
be
render
by
the
warship
of
the
Tsar
,
lead
expert
to
regard
the
outlook
as
exceedingly
gloomy
.
 
<EOS>
for
year
military
and
naval
man
have
discuss
the
possibility
of
invasion
,
haggle
over
controversial
point
,
but
have
never
arrive
at
any
definite
opinion
as
to
the
possibility
of
an
enemy
's
success
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
the
defence
of
the
country
be
to
be
test
.
 
<EOS>
Our
great
Empire
be
at
stake
.
 
<EOS>
the
power
of
steam
to
cause
rapid
transit
by
land
and
sea
,
the
uncertainty
of
the
place
of
disembarkment
,
and
the
great
weight
of
modern
naval
artillery
,
combine
to
render
the
defence
of
England
on
the
coast
itself
most
uncertain
and
hazardous
,
and
to
cause
grave
doubt
to
arise
in
the
mind
of
those
who
at
that
critical
moment
be
direct
the
forward
movement
of
the

.
 
<EOS>
the
british
public
,
whose
national
patriotism
find
vent
in
expression
of
confidence
in
the
Regular
Army
and
Volunteers
,
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
.
<EOS>
They
know
that
two
great
Powers
have
combine
to
crush
our
island
stronghold
,
and
be
eager
that
hostility
should
commence
in
order
that
the
enemy
should
be
teach
a
severe
lesson
for
their
presumption
.
 
<EOS>
They
,
however
,
know
nothing
of
the
plain
truth
,
that
although
the
1st
Army
Corps
at
Aldershot
would
be
ready
to
move
at
a
few
hour
'
notice
,
yet
it
be
hopeless
to
try
and
prevent
the
disembarkation
of
the
french
army
corp
along
a
long
line
of
unprotected
coast
by
the
action
of
a

force
only
one

third
of
their

<EOS>
so

by

the

keep

by
patient

keen

ready
at

the

<EOS>
but
the
dense
mist
that
overhung
everything
be
tantalise

hide
friend

,
and
no

London

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
at

soon
after

there

<EOS>
a

,
and
have
lose
no
time
in
assert
their
presence
and
demand
a
large

<EOS>

<EOS>
although

yet
they

<EOS>
the

but
the

in

work
terrible
havoc
both

in

It

the

<EOS>
but
such
an

the

<EOS>
the

the
incessant
thunder

<EOS>
the
attack
have
be
so
entirely
unexpected
that
the
troop
mobilise
and
send
there
<EOS>
have
arrive
too
late
.
<EOS>
the
town
be
be
sack
,
and
the
harbour
be
in
the
possession
of
the
French
,
who
be
land
their

great
number

<EOS>
from
Dieppe
and
Havre
transport

and
discharge
their
freight
of
fight
man
and
gun
under
cover
of
the
fire
from
the
french
warship
lie
close
in
land
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
the
step
take
during
the
last
twenty
year
to
improve
the
condition
of
our
force
on
land
and
sea
,
this
outbreak
of
hostility
find
us
far
from
be
in
a
state
of
preparedness
for
war
.
<EOS>
England
,
strangely
enough
,
have
never
yet
fully
realise
that
the
condition
of
war
have
entirely
change
.
<EOS>
in
day
go
by
,
when
troop
and
convoy
could
move
but
slowly
,
the
difficulty
of
provide
for
army
engage
in
operation
necessarily
limit
their
strength
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
quite
different
.
<EOS>
improve
communication
have
give
to
military
operation
astonish
rapidity
,
and
the
facility
with
which
large
masse
of
troop
,
gun
,
and
store
can
now
be
transport
to
great
distance
have
have
the
effect
of
proportionately
increase
number
.
<EOS>
as
a
result
of
this
,
with
the
exception
of
our
own
island
,
Europe
be
arm
to
the
tooth
.
<EOS>
yet
a
mobilisation
arrangement
that
be
faulty
and
not
clearly
understand
by
officer
or
man
,
be
the
cause
of
the
enemy
be
allow
to
land
.
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
that
the
military
authority
have
not
act
upon
the
one
principle
admit
on
every
side
,
namely
,
that
the
only
effective
defence
consist
of
attack
.
<EOS>
the
attack
,
to
succeed
,
should
have
be
sudden
and
opportune
,
and
the
Army
should
have
be
so
organise
that
on
the
occurrence
of
war
a
force
of
adequate
strength
would
have
be
at
once
available
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
we
miss
our
chance
to
secure
this
inestimable
advantage
afford
by
the
power
of
strike
the
first
blow
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
and
true
saying
,
that
"
England
's
good
bulwark
be
her
wooden
wall
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
no
longer
wooden
,
but
it
still
remain
an
admit
fact
that
England
's
strong
bulwark
should
be
her
Navy
,
and
that
any
other
nation
may
be
possess
of
an
equally
good
one
;
also
that
our
good
bulwark
should
be
equal
to
,
or
approach
,
the
fight
power
of
the
bulwark
own
by
any
two
possible
hostile
nation
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
strong
be
to
stave
off
war
;
to
be
weak
be
to
invite
attack
.
<EOS>
It
be
our
policy
of
_
laissez
faire
_
,
a
weak
Navy
and
an
Army
bind
up
with
red
tape
,
that
cause
this
disastrous
invasion
of
England
.
<EOS>
have
our
Fleet
be
sufficient
for
its
work
,
invasion
would
have
remain
a
threat
,
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
Our
Navy
be
not
only
our
first
,
but
our
last
line
of
defence
from
an
imperial
point
of
view
;
for
,
as
a
writer
in
the
_
Army
and
Navy
Gazette
_
point
out
in
1893
,
it
be
equally
manifest
and
unquestionable
that
without
land
force
to
act
as
the
spearhead
to
the
Navy
's
over
-
sea
shaft
,
the
offensive
tactic
so
essential
to
a
thorough
statesmanlike
defensive
policy
could
not
be
carry
out
.
<EOS>
again
,
the
mobility
and
efficiency
of
our
Regular
Army
should
have
be
such
that
the
victory
of
our
Fleet
could
be
speedily
and
vigorously
follow
by
decisive
blow
on
the
enemy
's
territory
.
 
<EOS>
already
the
news
of
the
landing
of
the
enemy
have
--
besides
cause
a
thrill
such
as
have
never
before
be
know
in
our
"
tight
little
island"--produced
its
effect
upon
the
price
of
food
in
London
as
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
in
England
we
have
only
five
day
'
bread
-
stuff
,
and
as
the
majority
of
our
supply
come
from
Russia
the
price
of
bread
treble
within
twelve
hour
,
and
the
ordinary
necessary
of
life
be
proportionately
dearer
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
dice
have
be
throw

and
the

<EOS>
a
cloudy
moonless
night

with
a
gusty
wind
which

and
then
sweep
the
top
of
the
forest
tree
,
cause
the
leave
to
surge
like
a
summer

.
 
<EOS>
withered
branch
creak
and
groan
,
and
a
dog

dismally
down
in
Flimwell
village
,
half

.
<EOS>

with
his
back
against
the
gnarled
trunk
of
a
giant
oak
on
the
edge
of
the

half

by
the
tall
bracken

<EOS>
stand
motionless
in
the
deep
shadow
,
with
his
eye
fix
upon
the
wide
stretch
of
slope
meadow
,
he
wait
,
ready
,
at
the
slight
appearance
of
the
enemy
's
scout
,
to
raise
the
alarm
and
call
to
arm
those
who
be
sleep
in
the
forest
after
their
day
's
march
.
 
<EOS>
the
City
Civilian
Volunteer
Battalion
which
he
have
join
be
on
its
way
to
take
part
in
the
conflict
,
which
every
one
know
would
be
desperate
.
<EOS>
under
the
command
of
Major
Mansford
,
an
experienced
elderly
officer
who
have
long
since
retire
from
the
Lancashire
Regiment
,
but
who
have
at
once
volunteer
to
lead
the
battalion
of
young
patriot
,
they
have
leave
London
by

for
Maidstone
,
whence
they
march
by
way
of
Linton
,
Marden
,
and
Goudhurst
to
Frith
Wood
,
where
they
have
bivouac
for
the

on

Sussex
border
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
know
that
russian
scout
have
succeed
in
get
as
far
as
Wadhurst
,
and
it
be
expect
that
one
of
the
french
reconnoitring
party
must
,
in
their
circuitous
survey
,
pass
the
border
of
the
wood
on
their
way
back
to
their
own
line
.
<EOS>
up
to
the
present
they
have
be
practically
unmoleste
.
<EOS>
the
british
army
be
now
mobilise
,
and
Kent
,
Sussex
,
and
Hampshire
be
overrun
with
soldier

<EOS>
every

unassume
Red
Lions
of
the

be
full
of
Britain
's
brave

.
<EOS>
the
echo
of
old

world
village
street
of
thatched
house
with
quaint
gable
be
awaken
night
and
day
by
the
rumbling
of
heavy
artillery
,
the
shout
of
the
driver
as
they
urge
along
their
team
,
and
the
rattle
of
ammunition
cart
and
of
ambulance
waggon
,
while
on
every
high
road
lead
south

be
on
the
march
,
and
eager
to
come

<EOS>
at
first
the
peaceful
people
of
the
village

,
wonder
,
and
admire
,
think
some
manoeuvre
be
about
to
take
place
--
for
military
manoeuvre
always
improve
village
trade
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
very
quickly
disillusioned
.
<EOS>
when
they
know
the
truth
--
that
the
enemy
be
actually
at
their
door
,
that
the
grey
-
coat
masse
of
the
russian
legion
be
lie
like
pack
of
wolf
in
the
undulate
country
between
Heathfield
,
Etchingham
,
and
the

--
they
be
panic
-
stricken
and
appal
.
<EOS>
They
watch
the
stream
of
redcoat

their
door
,
cheer
them
,
while
those
who
be
their

to
the
good

<EOS>
everywhere

<EOS>
It
must
be
say
that
over
the
border
the
people
be
more
law
-
abiding
.
<EOS>
the
Scotch
,
too
canny
to
listen
to
the
fiery
declamation
of
hoarse
and
shabby
agitator
,
prefer
to
trust

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
from

every

fearfulness
of
the
crash
that

<EOS>
It
be
now
know
throughout
the
breadth
of
our
land
that
the
Government
policy
be
faulty
,
that
War
Office
and
Admiralty
organisation
be
a
rotten
make
-
believe
,
and
,
bad
of
all
,
that
what
critic
have
long
ago
say
as
to
the
inadequacy
of
our
naval
defence
,
even
with
the
ship
build
under
the
programme
of
1894
,
have
now
,
alas
!
<EOS>
prove
to
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
the
suspense
be
awful

<EOS>
those
who
be
now
live
in
the
peaceful
atmosphere
of

,
surround
by
neighbour
and

in
the

of

a
sense
of
security

may
within
a
few
day
be
shoot
down
by
french
rifle
,
or
mow
down
brutally
by

Cossack

.
<EOS>
the
advance
of
the
enemy
be

daily
,
hourly
;
and
the
people
in
the
North
wait
,
staggered
,
breathless
,
and
terrified
.
<EOS>
man
eagerly
scan
the
newspaper
;
woman
press
their
child
to
their
breast
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mining
district
the
shock
have
not
inspire
the
same
amount
of
fear
as
at
the
port
and
in
the
manufacturing
centre
.
<EOS>
possibly
it
be
because
work
be
still
proceed
in
the
pit
,
and
constant
work
prevent
man
from
become
restless
,
or
trouble
themselves
about
a
nation
's
woe
.
<EOS>
toiler
who
work
below
know
that
foreign
invader
have
land
,
and
that
the
Militia
and
Volunteers
have
be
call
out
,
but
they
vaguely
believe
that
,
the
seat
of
war
be
away
down
south
--
a
very
long
distance
in
the
imagination
of
most
of
them
--
everything
would
be
over
before
they
could
be
call
upon
to
take
part
in
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
in
any
case
coal
and
iron
must
be
get
,
they
argue
,
and
while
they
have
work
they
have
little
time
for
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
great
number
of
stalwart
young
miner
enrol
themselves
in
the
local
Volunteer
corp
,
and
burn
to
avenge
the
affront
to
their
country
and
their
sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
those
be
indeed
fateful
,
ever
-
to
-
be
-
remember
day
.
 
<EOS>
amid
this
weary
,
anxious
watching
,
this
constant
dread
of
what
may
next
occur
,
an
item
of
news
be
circulate
which
cause
the
great
rejoicing
everywhere
.
<EOS>
intelligence
reach
New
York
,
by
cable
from
France
,
that
Germany
have
combine
with
England
against
the
Franco
-
Russian
alliance
,
that
her
vast
army
have
be
mobilise
,
and
that
already
the
brave
,
well
-
drill
legion
of
the
Emperor
William
have
cross
the
Vosges
,
and
pass
the
frontier
into
France
.
<EOS>
a
sharp
battle
have
be
fight
near
Givet
,
and
that
,
as
well
as
several
other
french
frontier
town
which
fall
in
1870
,
be
again
in
the
hand
of
the
Germans
.
 
<EOS>
how
different
be
german
method
to
those
of
the
British
!
 
<EOS>
with
a
perfect
scheme
of
attack
,
every
detail
of
which
have
be
long
think
out
,
and
which
work
without
a
hitch
,
the
Kaiser
's
force
be
await
the
word
of
command
to
march
onward
--
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
for
year
--
ever
since
they
teach
France
that
severe
lesson
in
the
last
disastrous
war
--
it
have
be
the
ambition
of
every
german
cavalryman
to
clink
his
spur
on
the
asphalte
of
the
Boulevards
.
<EOS>
now
they
be
actually
on
their
way
towards
their
goal
!
 
<EOS>
the
paper
be
full
of
these
late
unexpected
development
,
the
detail
of
which
,
necessarily
meagre
owe
to
the
lack
of
direct
communication
,
be
eagerly
discuss
.
<EOS>
It
be
believe
that
Germany
would
,
in
addition
to
defend
her
polish
frontier
and
attack
France
,
also
send
a
naval
squadron
from
Kiel
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
the
Tsar
's
spy
have
be
foil
,
and
Russia
and
France
now
know
they
have
make
a
false
move
!
<EOS>
Russia
's
rapid
and
decisive
movement
be
intend
to
prevent
the
signing
of
the
secret
alliance
,
and
to
bar
England
and
Germany
from
join
hand
.
<EOS>
but
happily
the
sly
machination
of
the
Count
von
Beilstein
,
the
release
convict
and
adventurer
,
have
in
a
measure
fail
,
for
Germany
have
consider
it
diplomatic
to
throw
in
her
fortune
with
Great
Britain
in
this
desperate
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
a
feeling
of
thankfulness
spread
through
the
land
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
it
be
plain
that
if
Germany
intend
to
wield
the
double
-
handle
sword
of
conquest
in
France
,
she
would
have
few
troop
to
spare
to
send
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
but
those
dark
day
,
full
of
agonising
suspense
,
drag
on
slowly
.
<EOS>
the
French
well
know
the
imminent
danger
that
threaten
their
own
country
,
yet
they
could
not
possibly
withdraw
.
<EOS>
mad
enthusiast
always
!
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
war
to
the
death
,
they
decide
.
<EOS>
the
conflict
could
not
be
avert
.
<EOS>
so
briton
unsheathe
their
steel
,
and
hold
themselves
in
readiness
for
a
fierce
and
desperate
fray
.
 
<EOS>
the
invasion
have
indeed
be
plan
by
our
enemy
with
marvellous
forethought
and
cunning
.
<EOS>
there
be
treachery
in
the
Intelligence
Department
of
the
British
Admiralty
,
foul
treachery
which
place
our
country
at
the
mercy
of
the
invader
,
and
sacrifice
thousand
of
life
.
<EOS>
on
the
morning
follow
the
sudden
Declaration
of

the

<EOS>
inquiry

COUNT
VON

at
HOME
.
  
<EOS>
Karl
von
Beilstein
sit
in
his
own
comfortable
saddlebag
-
chair
,
in
his
chamber
in
the
Albany
,
lazily
twist
a
cigarette
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
table
at
his
elbow
be
spread
sheet
319
of
the
Ordnance
Survey
Map
of
England
,
which
embrace
that
part
of
Sussex
where
the
enemy
be
encamp
.
<EOS>
with
red
and
blue
pencil
he
have
be
make
mystic
mark
upon
it
,
and
have
at
last
lay
it
aside
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
think
she
have
me
in
her
power
,
"
he
mutter
ominously
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
the
wolf
!
<EOS>
if
she
know
everything
,
she
could
make
me
crave
again
at
her
foot
for
mercy
.
<EOS>
happily
she
be
in
ignorance
;
therefore
that
trip
to
a
more
salubrious
climate
that
I
anticipate
be
for
the
present
postpone
.
<EOS>
I
have
silence
her
,
and
be
still
master
of
the
situation
--
still
the
agent
of
the
Tsar
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
utter
a
low
laugh
,
he
give
his
cigarette
a
final
twist
,
and
then
regard
it
critically
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
open
to
admit
his
valet
,
Grevel
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
message
from
the
Embassy
.
<EOS>
the
man

wait
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
His
master
open
the
note
which
be
hand
to
him
,
read
it
with
contract
brow
,
and
said--
 
<EOS>
"
tell
him
that
the
matter
shall
be
arrange
as
quickly
as
possible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
else
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
be
leave
London
,
and
shall
not
be
back
for
a
week
--
perhaps
long
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
a
slight
yawn
he
rise
and
pass
into
his
dressing
-
room
,
while
his
servant
go
to
deliver
his
message
to
the
man
in
wait
.
<EOS>
the
note
have
produce
a
marked
effect
upon
the
spy
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
order
from
his
taskmaster
in
St.
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
He
know
it
must
be
obey
.
<EOS>
every
moment
be
of
vital
consequence
in
carry
out
the
very
delicate
mission
intrust
to
him
,
a
mission
which
it
would
require
all
his
tact
and
cunning
to
execute
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
emerge
into
his
sitting
-
room
again
,
so
completely
disguise
that
even
his
most
intimate
acquaintance
would
have
fail
to
recognise
him
.
<EOS>
attired
in
rusty
black
,
with
clean
shaven
face
and
walk
with
a
scholarly
stoop
,
he
have
transform
himself
from
the
foppish
man
-
about
-
town
to
a
needy
country
parson
,
whose
cheap
boot
be
down
at
heel
,
and
in
the
lappel
of
whose
coat
be
display
a
piece
of
worn
and
fade
blue
.
 
<EOS>
"
listen
,
Pierre
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
to
his
man
,
who
enter
at
his
summon
.
<EOS>
"
while
I
be
away
keep
your
eye
and
ear
open
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
a
shadow
of
suspicion
in
any
quarter
,
burn
all
my
paper
,
send
me
warn
through
the
Embassy
,
and
clear
out
yourself
without
delay
.
<EOS>
Should
matter
assume
a
really
dangerous
aspect
,
you
must
get
down
to
the
russian
line
,
where
they
will
pass
you
through
,
and
put
you
on
board
one
of
our
ship
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
the
Ministry
at
Petersburg
promise
us
protection
at
last
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
;
we
have
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
when
the
game
be
up
among
these
lamb
,
we
shall
calmly
go
over
to
the
other
side
and
witness
the
fun
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
what
direction
be
you
now
go
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know

"
reply
the
spy
,
as
he
unlock
a
drawer
in
a
small
cabinet
in
a
niche
by
the
fireplace
and
take
from
it
a
long
circassian
knife
.
<EOS>
draw
the
bright
blade
from
its
leathern
sheath
,
he
feel
its
keen
double
edge
with
his
finger
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
a
razor
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
desperate
errand
--
eh
?
"
query
the
valet
,
with
a
grin
,
notice
how
carefully
the
Count

the
murderous
weapon
in

inner
pocket

"
yes

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
desperate

<EOS>
a
word
sometimes
mean
death

"
 
<EOS>
and
the
simple
rural
vicar
stride
out
and
down
the
stair
,
leave
the
crafty
Pierre
in
wonderment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
<EOS>
the
latter
exclaim
in
disgust
,
when
the
recede
footstep
have
die
away
.
"
<EOS>
so
you
vainly
imagine
,
my
dear
Karl
,
that
you
have
your
heel
upon
my
neck
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
It
be
good
for
me
that
you
do
not
give
me
credit
for
be
a
little
more
wideawake
,
otherwise
you
would
see
that
you
be
rake
the
chestnut
from
the
fire
for
me
.
<EOS>
_
Bien
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
be
silent
,
docile
,
obedient
;
I
merely
wait
for
you
to
burn
your
finger
,
then
the
whole
of
the
money
will
be
mine
to
enjoy
,
while
you
will
be
in
the
only
land
where
the
Tsar
do
not
require
secret
agent
.
<EOS>
vain
,
avaricious
fool

You
will
be
in

Von
Beilstein
meanwhile
speed
along
down
the
Haymarket
and
Pall

to
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
the
clock
on
the
stone
tower
of
the
Horse
Guards
show
it
be
one
o'clock
,
and
,
with
apparently
aimless
purpose
,
he
lounge
about
on
the
broad
pavement
outside
Old
Scotland
Yard
,
immediately
opposite
the
dark
facade
of
the
Admiralty
.
<EOS>
His
hawk
's
eye
carefully
scrutinise
every
single
person
of
the
busy
throng

or
leave
the
building

<EOS>
there
be
great
activity
at
the
naval
headquarters

and
the
courtyard
be
crowd
with
person
hurry
in
and
out
.
<EOS>
presently
,
after
a
short
but
vigilant
watch
,
he
turn
quickly
so
as
to
be
unobserved
,
and
move
slowly
away
.
 
<EOS>
the
cause
of
this
sudden
manoeuvre
be
the
appearance
of
a
well
-
dress
,
dark
-
bearded
man
of
about
forty
,
have
the
appearance
of
a
naval
officer
in
mufti
,
who
emerge
hastily
from
the
building
with
a
handbag
in
his
hand
,
and
cross
the
courtyard
to
the
kerb
,
where
he
stand
look
up

down

"

under

"
<EOS>
He

<EOS>
I

"
 
<EOS>
five
minute
later
the
naval
officer
be
in
a
hansom
,
drive
towards
Westminster
Bridge
,
while
,
at
a
little
distance
behind
,
the

<EOS>
once
on

trail
,
the
Count
never

<EOS>
cross
the
bridge
,
they
drive
on
rapidly
through
the
crowded
,
turbulent
street
of
South
London
to
the
Elephant
and
Castle
,
and
thence
down
the
Old
Kent
Road
to
the
New
Cross
Station
of
the
South
-
Eastern
Railway
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
protest
against
the
action
of
the
Government
,
and
in
order
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
establish
direct
communication
with
London
in
case
of
british
reverse
,
the
line
from
the
metropolis
to
the

have
be

by
the
Anarchists

<EOS>
on

at
Haysden
,
outside
Tunbridge
,
the
rail

also
be

up
for
a
considerable
distance
.
<EOS>
therefore

and
the
few
person

be
compel
to
take
train
at
the
station
in

remoter
southern
suburb

<EOS>
as
the
unsuspecting
officer
step
into

,
his
attention
be

the
quiet
and
seedy

when

from
which
place
they
journey
to
Deal
,
arrive
there
about
six
o'clock
.
<EOS>
throughout
,
it
be
apparent
to
the
crafty
watcher
that
the
man
he
be
follow
be
do
his
utmost
to
escape
observation
,
and
this
surmise
be
strengthen
by
his
action
on

<EOS>
the

after
a
preliminary
chat
upon
the
prospect
of

they

together
they

they
sit
in

of

with
the

<EOS>
on

but
upon
that
point

preserve
a
silence
that

<EOS>
in
their
wandering
about
the
town
they
see
on
every
side
the
havoc
cause
by
the

<EOS>
afterwards

the

by
this
despicable

one

<EOS>
from
his
inner
pocket
he
draw
forth
the
keen
circassian
blade
that
repose
there
,
and
gaze
thoughtfully
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
"

and
then
I

"
 
<EOS>
replace

knife
in
his
pocket

then

after
noiselessly
lock
the

colourless
liquid
to
escape

upon
the
sugar

which
quickly
absorb
it

leave
a
small
darken
stain
.
<EOS>
this
sugar
he
place
in
a
lock
drawer
to
dry
,
and
,

CHAPTER
XII
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
EAGLE
's
TALONS
.
  
<EOS>
many
british
military
and
naval
writer
have
ridicule
the
idea
of
a
surprise
invasion
without
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
to
gain
more
than
a
partial
and
temporary
control
of
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
although
an
attack
on
territory
without
have
previously
command
of
the
sea
have
generally
be
foredoom
to
failure
,
it
have
be
long
ago
suggest
by
certain
military
officer
in
the
course
of
lecture
at
the
United
Service
Institution
,
that
under
certain
condition
such
invasion
be
possible
,
and
that
France
may
ere
long
be
rule
by
some
ambitious
soldier
who
may
be
tempt
to
try
a
sudden
dash
on
_
le
perfide
Albion
_
.
<EOS>
They
point
out
that
at
bad
it
would
entail
on
France
the
loss
of
three
or
four
army
corp
,
a
loss
no
great
than
she
would
suffer
in
one
short
land
campaign
.
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
at
that
time
very
little
notice
be
take
of
such
criticism
and
illustration
,
for
briton
have
always
be
prone
to
cast
doubt
upon
the
power
of
other
nation
to
convey
troop
by
sea
,
to
embark
them
,
or
to
land
them
.
<EOS>
thus
the
many
suggestion
direct
towards
increase
the
mobility
and
efficiency
of
the
Army
be
,
like
other
warning
,
cast
aside
,
the
prevail
opinion
in
the
country
be
that
sudden
invasion
be
an
absolute
impossibility
.
 
<EOS>
prediction
of
prophet
that
have
so
long
be
scorn
,
deride
,
and
disregard
by
an
apathetic
british
public
be
rapidly
be

<EOS>
come
event
have
cast
dark
shadow
that
have
be
unheeded
,
and
now
the
unexpected
bursting
of
the
war
cloud
produce
panic
through
our
land
.
 
<EOS>
General
Sir
Archibald
Alison
strike
an
alarming
note
of
warning
when
he
write
in
_
Blackwood
_
in
December
1893
:
"
no
one
can
look
carefully
into
the
present
state
of
Europe
without
feel
convinced
that
it
can
not
continue
long
in
its
present
condition
.
<EOS>
every
country
be
maintain
an
armed
force
out
of
all

to
its

and
the
consequent

upon
its
monetary
system
and
its
industrial
population
be
ever
increase
,
and
must
sooner
or
later
become
unbearable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
have
never

sufficiently
impress
upon
the
british
public
,
that
when
mobilise
for
war
,
and
with
all
the
Reserves
call
out
,
Russia
have
at
her
command
2,722,000
officer
and
man
,
while
France
could
put
2,715,000
into
the

,
make
a
total
force
of
the
Franco

Russian
Armies
of
5,437,000

with
9920
field

<EOS>
this

beside

how

the

with

<EOS>
when

reel
and
shiver
.
 
<EOS>
so
well
have
the
Russians
direct
their
fire
that
the
british

could
not
reply
.
<EOS>
one

at

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
with

his

<EOS>
once
again
he
touch
the

and
again
a
torpedo
,
release
from
its
tube
,
speed
rapidly
through
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
a
dull
and
muffled
explosion
from
the
russian

.
<EOS>
above
the
dense
smoke
a

,
with
great
column
of

as
the

cease
their
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
dead
stillness
,
break
only
by
the
wash
of
the

<EOS>
then
the
smoke
clearing
show
the
debris
of
the

fast
sink
beneath
the
restless

<EOS>
some
splinter
precipitate
into

fall
with
loud

in

direction
,
and
amid
the
victorious
shout
of
the
british

the
disabled

with
its
flutter
russian

slowly
disappear
for

<EOS>
the

,
even
for

<EOS>
partially
crippled

she
be
,
the

slowly
westward
,
until
at
noon
on

day
she
fall

which

now
the

<EOS>
have
receive
genuine

<EOS>
compare
with
the
number
and
strength
of
the
french

russian
vessel
muster
in
the
Channel
,
this
force
be
so
small
as
to
appear
ludicrous
.
<EOS>
to
send
this
weak
defend
division
against
the
mighty
power
of
the
invader
be
sheer
madness
,
and
everybody
on
board
know
it
.
<EOS>
the
vessel
be
weak
in
every
detail
than
those
of
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
at
full
speed
the
british
vessel
steam
on
throughout
that
day
,
until
at
8
P.M.
,
when
about
twenty
mile
south

they
be
join
by

these

<EOS>
the
night
be

,
but
moonless

and
without

the

all
continue
the
voyage
up

silently
,
with

<EOS>
two
hour
later
the

notice
that
away
on
the

a

flash
twice
and
then
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
enemy

ship
have
signal
the
approach
of
the
defender
!
 
<EOS>
this
cause
the
British
Admiral
to
alter
his
course
slightly
,
and
the

steam
along
in
the
direction
the
light
have
show
.
 
<EOS>
in
turret
and
in
broadside
battery
there
be
a
deep
hush
of
expectation
.
<EOS>
officer

stand
at
their

scarcely

<EOS>
all

the

to
carry

<EOS>
these
tactic
cause
considerable
comment
.
 
<EOS>
the
order
be
to
make
straight
for
Eastbourne
,
and
to
suddenly
attack
and
destroy
any
of
the
hostile
transport
that
be
lie
there
,
<EOS>
the
object
be
twofold
--
firstly
,
to
cut
off
the
enemy

line
of
retreat
,
and
secondly
,
to
prevent
the
vessel
from
be

for
the
purpose
of

further
reinforcement

<EOS>
soon
after

A.M.
this

<EOS>
here
a

silently

without

<EOS>
a
few
minute
elapse

all
be
quiet

<EOS>
then
suddenly
a
bright
flash
be

by
a
fearful
explosion
,
and
the
bottom
of
the
Tsar

be
completely
rip
up
by
the

she
commence
to
settle
down
immediately
,
before
any

.
<EOS>
the
enemy
have
scarcely
recover
from
their

and
confusion
when
three

and
in

<EOS>
british

terrible

<EOS>
so
active

that
within

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
simultaneously
with

explosion
,
the
gun
of
the
_

,
_

_
,
and

_
thunder
out
a

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
the

to

<EOS>
at
first
the

be
very
ineffectual

but
gradually
as
the

creep
closer
to
each

<EOS>
the
encounter
become
more
and
more
desperate

<EOS>
the
russian
torpedo

,
_

,
and

the

<EOS>
that
the
British

be
already
successful
in
surprising
and
sink
a

true

nevertheless
the
number
of
russian

lie
there
be
much
great
than
the
British
Admiral
have
anticipate

and
,
to
say
the
least
,
the
four

find
themselves
in

most
critical
position

<EOS>
the

nevertheless

her

,
with
the
dogged

continue

<EOS>
with

the

but
there
be
scarcely
sufficient
wind

out
the

which

<EOS>
on

the

what

overwhelming
odd
,
for

she
send
a

from

of
her
20-ton
gun
right
under

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
the

show
that
those

reckless

<EOS>
as

it

how

for
the

<EOS>
the
force
of
the

have
be
so
great
that
the

hull
be
absolutely
break
in
two
,
and
as

<EOS>
the

turn
his

to
the

the

play
great
havoc
with

<EOS>
a

,
however
,
the

of
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
catch
the
_
Indomptable

in
an
unguarded
moment
,
and
,
spring
towards
one
of
the
electric
knob
before
him
,
press
it
.
<EOS>
this
have
the
effect
of
eject
a
torpedo
from
one
of
the
bow
tube
,
and
so
well
directed
be
it
that
a
few
second
later
there
be
a
deafening
report
,
as
part

the
stern

blow
away
,
raise
great
column

<EOS>
the
situation
be
awful
,
and
the
loss
of

everywhere
enormous
.
<EOS>
dense
,
blind
smoke
,
and
the
choking
fume
of
melinite
,
obscure
the

,
and
in
the
darkness
thus
cause
the
flame
from
the

shed
a
lurid
light
upon

strew
with
dead

die
.
<EOS>
the
cruiser
and
scout
by
which
our
battleship
be
surround
cut
off
many
of
the
french
torpedo
boat
,
but
a
large
number
get
right
in

and
some
terrible
disaster
be
thus
cause
.
<EOS>
once
inside
the
circle
of
british

,
all
fire
direct
at
the

be
as
dangerous
to

as
to

<EOS>
the
superiority
of
the
french
torpedo

be
,
alas

<EOS>
keenly

by

for
in

<EOS>
as

with
these
loss

those
of
the

be
at
this
stage
by
no

small

<EOS>
the
French

lose
two
cruiser

the

one

three

<EOS>
the

with
all
these

the

<EOS>
yet
the

be
tell
terribly
upon

<EOS>
upon
all

the
casualty
be
frightful
,
and
on

<EOS>
suddenly

into

with
the
striker
of

just
as
it

disastrous

between

<EOS>
the
effect
be
horrify
.
<EOS>
the

over
70

therefore
the
devastating

<EOS>
over

a

at

blow

the

<EOS>
the

nevertheless
her

just
after

have
strike
right

,
there
be
a

nearly
half

many

<EOS>
this
success
be

satisfaction
by
the
British

who

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
a

the

<EOS>
the

from

have
strike
under
her
stern
barbette
,
but
,
fail
to
penetrate
the
armour
,
glance
off
into
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Fiercer
and
more
fierce
become
the
fight
.
<EOS>
a

shot
from
one
of

67-ton
gun
on
the
_
Anson
's
_
rear
barbette
strike
the
conning

tower
of
the

,
blow
it
away
,
kill
the

and
those
who
be
direct
the

.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
be
sink
,
but
the
battle
still
rage
with
unabated
fury
.
<EOS>
each
side
struggle
desperately
for
the
mastery
.
<EOS>
the
british
,
fight
nobly
against
what
have
all
along
be
overwhelming
odd
,
have
succeed
in
sink
some
of
the
enemy
's
fine
ship
,
and
inflict
terrible
loss
upon
the
crew
of
the
other
;
yet
the
British
Admiral
,
on
view
the
situation
,
be
compel
to
admit
that
he
be
outnumber
,
and
that
a
continuance
of
the
struggle
would
inevitably
result
in
the
loss
of
other
of
his
ship
.
<EOS>
there
still
remain
three
of
the
enemy
's
vessel
to
each
one
of
the
British
.
<EOS>
His
ship
be
all
more
or
less
crippled
,
therefore
a
successful
stand
against
the
still
overwhelming
force
would
be
sheer
madness
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
the
sort
of
man
to
show
the
white
feather
;
nevertheless
a
retreat
upon
Portsmouth
have
now
become
a
matter
of
policy
,
and
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
a
few
minute
later
run
up
signal
intimate
to
the
other
vessel
her
intention
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
British
Squadron
move
away
down
Channel
the
hoarse
exultant
shout
of
the
enemy
fill
the
air
.
<EOS>
but
the
fighting
become
even
more
desperate
,
and
for
over
an
hour
there
be
a
most
exciting
chase
.
<EOS>
the
run
fire
do
little
harm
to
the
retreat
ship
,
but
their
stern
gun
play
terrible
havoc
with
the
french
and
russian
torpedo
boat
,
which
be
pick
off
one
after
another
with
remarkable
rapidity
.
 
<EOS>
off
Littlehampton
one
of
the
russian
ship
run
up
signal
,
and
immediately
the
enemy
's
ship
slacken
.
<EOS>
apparently
they
have
no
desire
to
follow
further
west
,
for
after
a
few
parting
shot
they
turn
and
stand
away
up
Channel
again
,
while
the
survive
ship
of
the
British
Squadron
steam
onward
in
the
blood
-
red
track
of
the
die
day
.
 
<EOS>
at
their
head
be
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
,
batter
,
and
bear
mark
of
the
deadly
strife
;
but
bright
against
the
clear

calm
evening
sky
,
the
british
flag
,
half
of
which
have
be
shoot

cool

<EOS>
the
British
Lion
have
show
his
tooth
.
<EOS>
alas
,
that
our
Navy
should
have
be
so
weak
!
<EOS>
several
of
the
ship
have
have
their
engine
severely
damage
or
break
,
but
our
margin
of
additional
strength
be
so
small
that
we
have
no
vessel
wherewith
to
replace
those
compel
to
return
to
port
.
 
<EOS>
the
struggle
in
this
,
the
first
naval
battle
in
the
defence
of
our
Empire
,
have
be
desperate
,
and
the

at

they

,
in

the

yet
the
cause
of

<EOS>
hurriedly
mass
in

from

by

of

,
they
have
,
owe
to
the
short

policy
of

arrive
without

night

and
in
the
hopeless

battalion

and

not
find
their

<EOS>
this
extraordinary
muddle
result
in
the
fresh

,
instead
of

send

to
reinforce
the

,
be
keep

while

many
hour
,
be
utterly
unable

the

which

<EOS>
though
they
make

with
desperate
determination
,
yet
at

the

be
drive

and
with
appalling

,
upon
their

,
and
the
latter
,
who
hold
out
bravely
,
be
at
last
also
compel
to
fall
back
upon
their
reserve
.
<EOS>
the
latter
,
which
include
half
a
battery
of
artillery
station
at
Wood
's
Farm
and
Toll
Bar
,
hold
the
enemy
in
temporary
check
;
but
when
the
heavy
french
artillery
be
at
length
bring
up
,
the
invader
be
enable
to
cut
the
railway
,
destroy
the
half
battery
at
Wood

,
turn
the
british
right
flank
,
and
compel

to
retreat
hastily
from
Horsham
and
fly
to
defensive
position
at
Guildford
and
Dorking
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
adroit
manoeuvre
the
enemy
succeed
in
take
over
two
hundred
prisoner
,
capture
the
gun
of
the
12-pounder
field
battery,--which
have
not
be
bring
into
play
for
the
simple
reason
that
only
ammunition
for
9-pounders
have
be
collect
in
the
town,--and
seize
a
large
quantity
of
store
and
ammunition
of
various
kind
.
 
<EOS>
this
success
give
the
enemy
the
key
to
the
situation
.
 
<EOS>
as
on
sea
,
so
on
land
,
our
blunder
defensive
policy
have
result
in
awful
disaster
.
<EOS>
sufficient
attention
have
never
be
pay
to
detail
,
and
the
firm
-
root
idea
that
Britain
could
never
be
invade
have
cause
careless
indifference
to
minor
matter
of
vital
importance
to
the
stability
of
our
Empire
.
 
<EOS>
the
contrast
between
the
combined
tactic
of
the
enemy
and
those
of
our
force
be
especially
noticeable
when
the
cavalry
patrol
of
the
british
fly
column
be
capture
on
the
Cowfield
road
and
the
column
defeat
.
<EOS>
the
commander
of
the
column
,
a
well
-
know
officer
,
unfortunately
,
like
many
other
,
have
have
very
little
experience
of
combined
tactic
,
and
look
upon
cavalry
not
merely
as
"
the
eye
and
ear
of
an
army
,
"
but
as
the
army
itself
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
defect
that
be
disastrous
.
<EOS>
for
many
year
past
it
have
never
appear
quite
clear
whether
british
cavalry
be
intend
to
act
_
en
masse
_
in
warfare
,
or
simply
as
scout
or
mount
infantry
,
therefore
their
training
have
be
uncertain
.
<EOS>
the
Home
establishment
of
our
cavalry
be
suppose
to
be
about
12,000
man
,
but
owe
to
a
parsimonious
administration
only
about
half
that
number
have
horse
,
and
in
some
corp
less
than
a
half
.
<EOS>
another
glaring
defect
be
the
division
of
many
regiment
into
detachment
station
in
various
town
,
the
inevitable
result
of
this
be
that
many
such
detachment
be
without
regimental
practice
for
month
,
and
there
be
many
who
have
not
manoeuvre
with
a
force
of
all
arm
_
for
year
<EOS>
_
!
 
<EOS>
Army
organisation
prove
a
miserable
failure
.
 
<EOS>
the
supply
of
ammunition
be
totally
inadequate
,
and
a
disgrace
to
a
nation
which
hold
its
head
above
all
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
depots
have
be
establish
at
various
centre
,
yet
with
strange
oversight
no
provision
have
be
make
for
the
work
of
ammunition
train
.
 
<EOS>
originally
it
have
be
intend
that
man
for
this
most
important
duty
should
be
find
by
the
Reserves
,
and
that
the
horse
should
be
those
privately
register
;
nevertheless
it
be
find
necessary
at
the
very
last
moment
to
weaken
our
artillery
by
detail
experienced
man
for
duty
with
the
ammunition
column
.
<EOS>
many
of
the
horse
which
be
register
for
service
be
find
to
be
totally
unfit
,
and
very
few
of
the
remainder
have
be
previously
train
.
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
those
which
be
require
for
the
cavalry
regiment
--
nearly
six
thousand
--
the
good
man
in
the
regiment
have
to
be
tell
off
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
invasion
to
hurriedly
train
and
prepare
these
animal
for
service
,
when
they
should
have
be
available
to
proceed
to
any
part
of
the
kingdom
at
twenty
-
four
hour
'
notice
.
<EOS>
by
such
defect
mobilisation
be
foredoom
to
failure
.
 
<EOS>
the
scheme
,
instead
of
be
so
arrange
as
to
be
carry
out
without
confusion
,
result
in
muddle
and
farcical
humiliation
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
the
infantry
,
owe
to
the
recent
departure
of
the
indian
draft
,
have
be
considerably
weaken
,
many
battalion
be
find
on
mobilisation
very
disorganised
and
inefficient
.
<EOS>
as
an
instance
,
out
of
one
battalion
at
Aldershot
,
which
be
on
paper
1000
strong
,
200
have
be
send
away
to
India
,
while
of
the
remainder
more
than
half
have
only
see
twelve
month
'
service
,
and
a
large
percentage
be
either
under
eighteen
year
of
age
or
be
"
special
enlistment
,
"
namely
,
below
the
minimum
standard
of
height
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
battalion
compare
very
unfavourably
with
the
majority
of
Volunteer
regiments,--those
of
the
Stafford
Brigade
,
for
instance,--the
average
service
of
the
man
in
those
regiment
be
over
five
year
,
and
the
average
age
twenty
-
seven
year
.
<EOS>
british
officer
have
long
ago
foresee
all
these
defect
,
and
many
other
,
yet
they
have
preserve
an
enforced
silence
.
<EOS>
They
themselves
be
very
inefficiently
train
in
manoeuvring
,
for
,
with
one
or
two
exception
,
there
be
no
station
in
the
kingdom
where
force
be
sufficiently
numerous
to
give
the
majority
of
the
superior
officer
practice
in
handle
combined
body
of
troop
.
 
<EOS>
thus
in
practical
experience
in
the
field
they
be
far
behind
both
French
and
Russians
,
and
it
be
this
very
serious
deficiency
that
now
become

apparent

<EOS>
british

<EOS>
but
alas

<EOS>
their

,
though
stubborn

futile

<EOS>
time

<EOS>
the

that
every
preparation
have

make
for

It
also
appear
that
at

take
by

,
very
little

that
the

occupy
by
the

have
be
very
carefully
choose
as
the
most
advantageous
the
russian
commander
be
bind
to
admit
,
and
although
he
possess
such
a
large
body
of
man
it
would
require
considerable
tactical
skill
to
dislodge
the
defender
in
order
to
prevent
them
cover

the
country
over
which
the

<EOS>
the

with
a

side
,
and
the
enemy
be
proceed
at
a
comfortable
pace
when
suddenly
a
number
of
rifle
rattle
out
simultaneously
,
and
then
it
be
discover
that
the
wall
have
be
loophole
,
and
that
the
British
be
pour
upon
them
a
deadly
hail
from
which
there
be
no

<EOS>
the
wall
bristle
with
rifle
,
and
from
them
come
a
storm
of
bullet
that
kill
and
wound
dozen
of
the
invader
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
,
however
,
show
considerable
daring
,
for
while
the
magazine

pour
forth
their
deadly
shower
,
they
rally
and
charge
up
the
hill
in
the
face
of
the
fearful
odd

<EOS>
for
ten
minute

perhaps
a

,
the

enter
the

<EOS>
gradually

by

eventually
retreat
in

down
into

,
leave
nearly
two

<EOS>
the
British
,
whose
loss
be
very
small
,
have
show
the
invader
that
they
mean
to
defend
Birmingham

and
that
every

an

their

therefore
the

CHAPTER

<EOS>
FALL
of
BIRMINGHAM
.
  
<EOS>
the
battle
outside
Birmingham
be
long
,
fierce
,
and
furious
.
<EOS>
no
more
desperately
contest
engagement
have
ever
occur
in
the
history
of
the
British
Empire
.
<EOS>
from
the
very
first
moment
of
the
fight
it
be
apparent
that
the
struggle
would
be
a
fearful
one
,
both
side
possess
advantage
;
the
british
by
reason
of
the
magnificent
defensive
position
they
occupy
,
and
the
Russians
by
reason
of
their
overwhelming
number
.
<EOS>
against
a
defend
force
of
50,000
of
all
arm
,
150,000
invader
--
the
majority
of
whom
be
Russians
--
be
now
fight
,
and
the
combat
be
necessarily
long
and
deadly
.
<EOS>
british
Volunteers
be
conspicuous
everywhere
by
their
bravery
;
the
Canadians
render
most
valuable
assistance
,
fire
from
time
to
time
with
excellent
precision
,
and
hold
their
position
with
splendid
courage
;
while
the
irish
Brigade
,
who
have
move
rapidly
from
King
's
Cliffe
by
train
and
road
,
and
have
arrive
in
time
,
now
hold
their
own
in
a
position
close
to
Kingsheath
House
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
the
principal
building
in
Birmingham
have
during
the
past
day
or
two
be
convert
into
hospital
,
amongst
other
the
Post
Office
,
where
the
train
nurse
receive
very
valuable
assistance
from
the
female
clerk
.
<EOS>
a
train
full
of
british
wound
be
capture
early
in
the
evening
at
Barnt
Green
.
<EOS>
It
contain
regular
troop
and
civilian
from
the
Stratford
force
which
have
fall
back
to
Alcester
,
and
the
train
have
be
send
on
from
there
in
the
hope
that
it
would
get
through
before
the
enemy
be
able
to
cut
the
line
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
not
accomplish
,
for
the
Russians
inhumanely
turn
out
the
wound
and
fill
the
train
with
their
own
troop
and
ammunition
.
<EOS>
then
,
under
the
guidance
of
a
Birmingham
railway
man
of
french
nationality
who
have
be
act
as
spy
,
the
train
proceed
to
New
Street
Station
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
the
official
at
the
station
to
cope
with
the
enemy
,
for
they
have
only
expect
their
own
wound
,
or
they
would
,
of
course
,
have
wreck
the
train
by
alter
the
point
before
it
arrive
in
the
station
.
<EOS>
the
Russians
therefore
detrain
,
and
,
lead
by
their
spy
,
make
a
dash
along
the
subway
lead
to
the
lift
ascend
to
the
Post
Office
.
<EOS>
these
be
secure
,
and
the
office
be
soon
capture
by
the
Russians
,
who
not
only
thereby
obtain
a
footing
in
the
very
centre
of
the
town
from
which
there
be
not
much
chance
of
dislodge
them
before
Birmingham
fall
,
but
they
have
also
obtain
possession
of
the
most
important
telegraph
centre
for
the
North
and
Midland
district
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
before
the
first
flush
of
dawn
the
whole
of
the
country
from
Kings
Norton
right
across
to
Solihull
be
one
huge
battlefield
,
and
when
the
sun
rise
,
bright
and
glorious
,
its
ray
be
obscure
by
the
cloud
of
smoke
which
hang
like
a
funeral
pall
over
hill
and
dale
.
<EOS>
for
a
long
period
the
principal
russian
battery
on
the
Stratford
Road
be
short
of
ammunition
,
and
,
see
this
,
the
strong
british
battery
at
Northfield
move
quickly
up
into
a
command
position
at
Drake

cross

before
it

<EOS>
during
this
time

however
,
detachment
of
canadian
marksman
have
be
detail
with
no
other
purpose
than
to
sweep
the
russian
road
at
the
expose
point
of
its
course
,
and
to
fire
at
everything
and
everybody
expose
on
the
ridge
.
<EOS>
this
be
most
effective
,
and
for
quite
half
an
hour
prevent
any
supply
of
ammunition
reach
the
enemy
,
thus
give
the
british
battery
an
opportunity
to
establish
itself
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
both
battery
of
defender
open
fire
simultaneously
upon
the
russian
gun
,
and
so
thickly
fall
the
shot
,
that
although

the
enemy

<EOS>
the
Canadians
have
lay

of
their

which
be
explode
just
as
the

<EOS>
bullet
be

<EOS>
Hour
after

the
fighting

<EOS>
the
British

,
with
an
inner

across
from

Harborne
,
and
Edgbaston
,
to
the
high

on
the
Hagley

,
close
to
the

while
the

the

sustain
by
reason
of
the
defender
'
artillery
fire
do
not

however
,
disconcert

<EOS>
but
for
the
huge
right
column
of
invader
advance
on
Birmingham
by
way
of
Acock
's
Green
,
it
seem
an
even

yet
as
afternoon

the
firing
in
the
valley
swell
in
volume
,
and
the
mad
clamour
of
battle
still
surge
up
into
the
blue
cloudless
heaven
.
 
<EOS>
the
enemy
could
see
on
the
sky

line
the
british
reinforcement
as
they
come
up
from
Halesowen
by
the
road
close
to
their

have
be

in
a
state
of

but
as

sink
behind

<EOS>
the

be
in

.
<EOS>
the
British
,
as
they
stand
,
could
almost
keep
back
the
foe
,
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
not
quite
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
soon
a
concentric
rush
for
the
hill
,
and
as
the
cannon
thunder
and
rifle
rattle
,
hundred

the
grey

fall
back
and
roll
down
the
steep
slope
dead

die
,
but
the
other
push
on
in

of
the
frown
defence
,
use
their
bayonet
with
desperate
energy
,
and
a
few
minute
later
loud
shout
in
Russian
tell
that
the
ridge
have
be
clear
and
the

.
<EOS>
the
battle
have
be
long
and
terrible
;
the
carnage
awful
!
 
<EOS>
the
British

make
a
last
desperate
stand
,
fight
a
fierce
hand

but
ere
long
half

the
remainder
be
compel
to
leave
their

in
possession
of
the
enemy
and
fly
north
to
Sandwell
to
save
themselves

<EOS>
then
,
as
they
flee
,
the
Russians
turn
the
british
gun
near
St.
Augustine
's
upon
them
,
cause
havoc
in

<EOS>
the
shatter

have
at

break
down
the

,
raise
loud

and
,
after
reorganise

march
down
the
Hagley

upon

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
the
sacrifice
of
human

have
be
frightful

<EOS>
the
whole

from
Great
Packington

be
strew
with

<EOS>
have
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
defend
force
consist
of
only
50,000
man
against
100,000
Russians
,
the

which

the
Russians

in

<EOS>
as

however

the

<EOS>
though
the
citizen
'
loss
have
already
be
terrific
,
nevertheless
they
find
that
they
be
still
determined
to

and
behind
them

<EOS>
the
first

have
be
construct
at
the
junction
of
Monument

,
and
as

<EOS>
in

to
a

,
three
Maxims

command
the
whole

literally
mow
down
the
enemy
as

<EOS>
time
after
time
the
Russians
rush
upon
the
defender
'
position
,
only
to
be
hurl
back
again
by
the
leaden
hail
,
which
fall
so
thickly
that
it
be
impossible
for
any

withstand
it
.
<EOS>
by
this
the

but
it
be
not
long
before
they
establish
a
battery
at
the
corner
of
Norfolk
Road
,
and
pour
shell
upon
the

with
frightful
effect
.
<EOS>
quickly
the

and
the
Russians
at
last
break
down
the
barrier
,
engage
in
a
conflict
at

with
the
defender
.
 
<EOS>
the

along

<EOS>
the
slaughter
on

be
awful
,
for
a

<EOS>
at

in

<EOS>
in
the
darkness
that

the
scene
in

<EOS>
the
only
light
be
the
flash
from
gun

muzzle
and
the
glare
of

<EOS>
the
civilian
defender
,
reinforce
by
regular
soldier
,
Militia
,
and
Volunteers
,
have
make
such
excellent
preparation
for
defence
,

strenuous
opposition
,
that
almost
every
foot
the
Russians

reason
of
the

<EOS>
in

,
as

the

the
fierce

and
,
burst
,
decimate
them
in
a
horrible
manner
;
yet
through
the
long
close
night
there
be
never
a
lack
of
brave
man
to
step
into
the
breach
and
take
up
the
arm
of
their
dead
comrade
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
only
when
the
enemy
succeed
in
set
fire
to
the
Courts
,
and
compel
the
defender
to
cease
their
vigorous
rifle
fire
from
the
window
,
that
the
position
be
win
;
and
not
until
hundred
of
Russians
lay
dead

in
the

.
 
<EOS>
in

then

onward
with

almost
before

<EOS>
without

safety
,
every

in

I
find
myself
with
a
sergeant

eighteen
man
pursue
by
a
large
skirmishing
party
of
Russians

<EOS>
all
we
could
do
be
to

this
we
do

at

count
on

therefore
very
soon
we
be
inside

and
have
barricade
the
little
place

scarcely
have
we
accomplish
this
when
the

shot

in

the

Our
slacken
fire
have
deceive
them
,
and
as
the
storm
party
dash
forward
,
they
be
meet
by
vigorous
volley
from
our
magazine
rifle
,
which
knock
over
dozen
,
and
compel
the
remainder
to
again
retire
.
 
<EOS>
"
again
the
enemy
make
a
desperate
onslaught
,
and
again
we
succeed
in
hurl
them
back
,
and
stretch
dead
a
dozen
or
more
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
great
force
of
Russians
be
move
slowly
up
the
hill
,
and
I
know
that
to
hold
the
place
much
longer
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
from
the
rear
of
the
building
a
vigorous
attack
have
now
commence
,
and
move
more
man
round
to
the
rear
,
so
that
our
fire
would
command
the
sloping
approach
to
the
house
,
I
give
an
order
to
fire
steadily
.
<EOS>
a
moment
later
my
sergeant
and
two
other
man
have
be
severely
wound
,
and
although
the
former
have
have
his
arm
break
,
and
be
near
faint
from
loss
of
blood
,
nevertheless
he
keep
up
,
rest
his
rifle
-
barrel
upon
the
shatter
window
-
ledge
,
and
pour
out
the
deadly
content
of
his
magazine
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
few
minute
afterwards
a
bullet
shatter
my
left
hand
,
and
the
man
who
crouch
next
to
me
under
the
window
be
a
second
later
shot
through
the
heart
,
and
fall
back
dead
among
the
disorder
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
"
still
not
a
man
hesitate
,
not
a
word
of
despair
be
utter
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
death
stare
us
in
the
face
,
and
that
to
face
it
bravely
be
a
Briton
's
duty
.
<EOS>
only
once
I
shout
above
the
din
:
'
do
your
good
,
boy
!
<EOS>
remember
we
we
be
all
Britons
,
and
those
vermin
outside
have
wreck
our
home

kill
those
we
love

let
's
have
our
revenge
,
even
if

for
it

'
We
will
stick
to
'em
till
the
very
last

never
fear

cheerily
reply
one
young
fellow
as
he
reload
his
gun
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
ere
he
could
raise
it
to
fire
,
a
bullet
strike
him
in
the
throat
.
<EOS>
He
stagger
back
,
and
a
few
moment
later
be
a
corpse
.
 
<EOS>
"
undaunte
,
however
,
my
man
determine
to
sell
their
life
as
dearly
as
possible
,
and
continue
their
fire
,
time
after
time
repel
the
attack
,
and
sweep
away
the
grey

coat
as
they
emerge
from
behind
the
low
wall

three

hold
his

to
his
breast

where
he
have
receive
a
terrible
and
mortal
wound

<EOS>
Our
situation
at
that
moment
be
most
critical

<EOS>
only
two
round
remain
to
each
of
my
nine
brave

not
a

<EOS>
"
Looking
,
I
see
in
the
fade
twilight
the
dark
masse
of
the
enemy
move
up
the
steep
road
,
and
at
that
moment
a
round
be
fire
with
effect
upon
those
who
have

one

we

blind
smoke
suddenly
fill
the
half

we
know
that
the
enemy

fire

I
step
forward
,

shout
for
the
last
time
the
order
to
my
brave
comrade
to
fire

<EOS>
nine
rifle
ring
out
simultaneously

I
have

show
myself
imprudently

when
I

my

I

<EOS>
It
be
a
black
day
for

CHAPTER
XX
.
 
<EOS>
our
REVENGE
in
the
MEDITERRANEAN
.
  
<EOS>
many
important
event
have
occur
in
the
Mediterranean
since
the
outbreak
of
hostility
.
<EOS>
at
the
moment
of
the
sudden
Declaration
of
War
,
the
ship
form
the
British
Mediterranean
Squadron
be
at
Larnaka
,
Cyprus
,
and
on
receipt
of
the
alarming
intelligence
,
the
Admiral
sail
immediately
for
Malta
.
<EOS>
on
arrival
there
,
he
hear
that
a
strong
force
of
french
vessel
have
be
despatch
to
Gibraltar
for
the
purpose
of
prevent
any
british
ship
from
get
out
of
the
Mediterranean
in
order
to
strengthen
the
Channel
Squadron
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
wait
for
some
day
at
Malta
,
in
hourly
expectation
of
instruction
,
which
come
at
length
about
two
o'clock
one
morning
,
and
an
hour
later
the
Squadron
sail
westward
for
an
unknown
destination
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Fleet
in
those
water
be
notoriously
inadequate
in
comparison
with
those
of
France
and
Russia
.
<EOS>
It

with

and

<EOS>
the
information
receive
by
our
Fleet
at
Malta
be
to
the
effect
that
the
french
force
at
Gibraltar
be
so
strong
that
a
successful
attack
be
out
of
the
question
;
while
the
russian
Mediterranean
and
Black
Sea
Fleets
,
the
strength
of
which
be
considerable
,
be
also
know
to
be
approach
for
the
purpose
of
co
-
operating
with
the
French
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
addition
of
three
new
battleship
and
two
new
cruiser
to
our
force
in
the
Mediterranean
,
the
utter
inadequacy
of
our
Navy
be
still
very
apparent
.
<EOS>
for
year
the
british
public
have
demand
that
a
dozen
more
new
battleship
should
be
construct
in
case
of
casualty
,
but
these
demand
be
unheeded
,
and
during
the
three
year
that
have
pass
we
have
lose
our
naval
supremacy
,
for
<EOS>
France
and
Russia
combine
be
now
considerably
strong
.
<EOS>
France
alone
have
150
fighting
pennant
available
along
her
southern
shore
,
against
our
59
;
and
the
Tsar
's
ship
be
all
strong
,
well
-
equip
,
and
arm
with
gun
of
the
late
type
.
 
<EOS>
as
be
fear
from
the
outset
,
the
russian
Black
Sea
Fleet
have
strike
for
the
Suez
Canal
,
England
's
highway
to
the
East
.
<EOS>
Egypt
,
the
Bosphorus
,
Gibraltar
,
and
Tripoli
in
the
grasp
of
the
enemy
,
mean
supremacy
in
the
East
,
and
a
situation
that
would
not
be
tolerate
by
either
Italy
or
Austria
.
<EOS>
therefore
the
British
Admiral
,
recognise
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
,
and
have
receive
instruction
to
return
home
and
assist
in
the
defence
of
Britain
,
muster
his
force
and
clear
for
action
.
<EOS>
the
event
that
occur
immediately
afterwards
be

relate
in
the
graphic

scarcely

It

shot

the
gun

be
well
sight

ere

fire
again
such
a
storm
of
shell
burst
upon
us
that
I
confess
for
a
moment
I
stand
in
my
conning

motionless

in

the
town
without

simply
to
destroy
it

slip
by

our

shut
off

we
offer
a
very
indistinct
target
to
the
enemy

<EOS>
on
nearly
all
our
ship
,
however
,
there
be
some
slight
casualty
.
<EOS>
a
shell
severely
damage
the
superstructure
of
the
_
Jupiter

,
while
other
render
useless
several
of
her
machine

it
not

the
consequence
to
us
would
also
have
be
very
serious
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
our
two
22-ton

render
valuable
service
,

contribute
in
no
small
measure
to
the
demolition
of
the
town

"
from
the
outset
we
could
see
that
Algiers
be
totally
unprepared
for
attack
,
and
,
continue
our
fire
calmly
and
regularly
,
we
watch
the
flame
burst
forth
in
every
part
of
the
town
and
leaping
skyward

<EOS>
on
shore
the
gun
keep
up
their
roar

by
aid
of
glass
we
could
detect
how
effectual
be
our
shell
in
wreck
the
fortification

lay
in
ruin
the
european
quarter

<EOS>
every
moment
we

deal
terrible
blow
which
shake
the
city
to
its
foundation

<EOS>
the
formidable
city

avail
them
nothing

for
we
could
drop
our
shell
anywhere
we
please
,
either
on
the
hill
at
Mustapha

upon
the
pretty
moorish
villas

line
the
shore

away

<EOS>
under
such
a
fire
thousand
of
native
and
Europeans
must
have
perish
,
for
we
be
determined
to
carry
out
our
intention
,
and
teach
the
invader
a
lesson
they
be
not
likely
to
easily
forget

time
after

6-inch

keep
up
their
roar

continuously

as
the
hour
go
by

we
continue
our
work
of
merciless
destruction

we
be
hit
once

twice
,

beyond
the
loss
of
two
man
and
some
unimportant
damage
we
escape
further
punishment

the
roar
of
our
gun
be
deafen
,
and
the
smoke
hang
over
the
calm
sea

a
storm

<EOS>
still
we
keep
on
in
the
face
of
the
gall
fire
from
the
shore

before
midnight
have
the
satisfaction
of
witness
a
magnificent
spectacle

for
the
isolate
conflagration
gradually
united

the
whole
town

in
flame

We
have
accomplish
our
work

with
cheer
for
Old
England
we
give
a
parting
shot
,

soon

away

the
sicilian
coast

the
journey

uneventful

just
before
noon

follow
day

I
be
at
that
time
on
duty
,

suddenly
,
to
my
surprise
,
detect
a
number
of
ship
.
<EOS>
by
the
aid
of
our
glass
,
the
captain
and
I
find
to
our
dismay
that
a
number
of
the
most
powerful
vessel
of
the
Russian
Fleet
be
bear
down
upon
us
!
<EOS>
all
our
other
vessel
have
make
the
same
discovery
,
and
I
must
confess
that
the
meeting
be
somewhat
disconcerting
.
<EOS>
the
strength
of
the
russian
ironclad
be
such
as
to
cause
our
heart
to
beat
more
quickly
.
<EOS>
to
engage
that
great
force
mean
certain
defeat
,
while
it
be
necessary
that
our
Admiral
off
marseille
should
know
of
the
whereabouts
of
this
hostile
squadron
,
therefore
we
resolve
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
but
although
we
alter
our
course
and
put
on
all
speed
,
we
be
,
alas
!
<EOS>
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
at
last
we
determine
at
all
hazard
to
stick
to
our
gun
so
long
as
we
be
afloat
,
and
as
the
first
of

ironclad

within
range

we

out
together
,
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
we
find
ourselves
be
sweep
from
stem
to
stern
by
the
enemy

shell
.
<EOS>
the
russian
battleship
be
all
well
armoured
,
and
have
a
much
heavy
shell
fire
than
the
vessel
of
either
France

Britain

<EOS>
We
be
both
in
column
of
division
in
line
ahead
,
but
from
the
first
moment
of
the
engagement
our
position
be
critical
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
terrific
and
deadly
storm
burst
upon
us
from
the
enemy
's
top
,
while
his
heavy
gun
keep
up
an
incessant
thunder
.
<EOS>
with
such
an
enormous
force
against
us

it
be
apparent
to
every
man

that
disaster

It
have
,
alas
!
<EOS>
never
be
grave
sufficiently
deep
upon
the
public

<EOS>
how
absurdly
weak
we

in

Mediterranean

<EOS>
here
,
as
in
all
other
squadron
,
every
grade
of
officer
from
commander
downward
be
deficient
in
number
,
and
the
ship
in
commission
have
for
year
be
so
much
below
their
complement
that
the
work
have
only
be
carry
on
with

seaman

train
engine

scrape
together

<EOS>
in
fact
,
successive
british
government
of
both
party
have
subordinate
national
necessity
to
a
desire
to
evade
a
material
increase
in
taxation
,

now
at
last
our
Mediterranean
Squadron
be
compel
to
face
the
inevitable
.

"
the
insidious
cunning
and
patient
method
to
which
the
Russians
resort
in
order
to
attain
their
aim
and
break
their
boundary
have
once
more
be
illustrate
.
<EOS>
They
have
,
by
dint
of
extraordinary
chicanery
,
secured
absolute
possession
of
the
small
turkish
peninsula
know
as
Mount
Athos
.
<EOS>
situate
near
the
entrance
of
the
Gulf
of
Salonica
,
it
be
a
paramount
strategical
position
,
and
its
possessor
be
now
enable
to
keep
watch
upon
Macedonia
,
and
in
the
meantime
be
very
near
the
Dardanelles
,
and
also
Asia
Minor
.
<EOS>
the
possession
be
accomplish
in
a
curiously
secret
manner
,
show
to
what
extent
russian
foresight
and
artifice
be
carry
.
<EOS>
for
year
past
the
_
Societe
Slav
de
Bienfaisance
_
have
be
send
,
through
a
bank
in
Salonica
,
large
sum
of
money
to
further
the
aim
.
<EOS>
to
the
casual
observer
there
be
nothing
extraordinary
about
this
,
for
the
Russians
have
establish
on
the
lofty
height
several
monastery
,
convert
the
place
into
a
clerical
settlement
.
<EOS>
this
fact
be
point
out
by
the
_
Pall
Mall
Gazette
_
as
far
back
as
1893
,
but
the
british
public
at
that
time
fail
to
detect
any
russian
intrigue

gradually
,

,
Muscovite
rouble
purchase

surround
property

and
greek
convent

reduce
to
poverty

institution
flourish

,
strangely
enough
,
the
inmate
of
these
monastery
be
suddenly
discover
to
be
mock
cleric

then
it
be
disclose
that
under

cover

garment

robe

find
the
Tsar

three

Sultan

weakness

to

almighty
backsheesh

to
the
shortsightedness
of

statesman

the
Russians
be
not

the
position

to
them
,
with
the
result
that
they
have
now
firmly
establish
themselves
where
they
be
enable
to
counteract
british
action
and
influence

<EOS>
a
naval
station

for
their
Mediterranean
Squadron
at
Poros
,
off
the
eastern
coast
of
the
Peloponnesus
,
some
fifteen
mile
due
south
of

island

here
there

three
mile
of
deep
water
safe
from
sea
attack

with
an
arsenal
and
dockyard
,
on
the
very
weak
point
along
the
line
of
our
highway
between
England
and
India

the
manner
in
which
our
power
in
the
Mediterranean

undermine

there
be
,
however
,
no
time
for
reflection
amid
the
deafening
roar

<EOS>
this
Black
Sea
Fleet
that
have
burst
its
bond
and
pass
through
the
Dardanelles

to
sweep
us
from

the

suddenly
there
be
a

explosion

a

rise
under

the

up

a

I
witness
another
disaster

for
a
shot
from
one
of
her
bow
gun
strike
the
torpedo
boat
that
have
just
assist

a

just
at
the

moment
a
cheer
from
the
crew
of
one
of
our
6-inch
gun
prompt
me
to
look
for
the
cause

I
find
in
the
fact

they
have
shoot
the

completely
away

<EOS>
"
again
another
frightful
explosion
sound
loud
above
the
incessant
din

to
my
satisfaction
I
see
a
great
column
of
water
rise
around
the

also
strike
with
such
terrible
effect
that
the

in

the

close

It
be
nearly
three
bell
,

the
sun
be
set

<EOS>
a
gall
fire
from
the
machine
gun
in
the
foretop
of
the

suddenly
sweep
our
deck
,
kill
a

at

a
shot
from

crash
into

must
have
cause
terrible
havoc
among

a

later
we
be
dismay
by
the
report
that
our
steering

have
be
break

<EOS>
for
a
few
second
we
be
helplessly
swinge
round
under
the
awful
fire
which
be
now
pour
from

great
gun
of
the
russian
ironclad

our

be
make
strenuous
effort
to
recover
control
of

when
I
see
the
torpedo
boat

shoot
suddenly
across

quickly
slacken
as
she
get
to

"
<EOS>
a
second
later
I
realise
her
intention
,

shout
frantically
.
<EOS>
a
line
of
bubble
have
appear
on
the
surface
advance
swiftly
towards
us

<EOS>
She
have
eject
a
torpedo
straight
at
us
,
and
I
stand
petrified
,
not
dare
to
breathe
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
moment
later
there
come
a
terrific
explosion
right
underneath
us
,
follow
by
a
harsh
tearing
sound
as
iron
plate
be
tear
asunder
like
tinfoil
,
and
the
ship
's
side
be
rip
completely
up
.
<EOS>
the
_

heave
high
and
plunge
heavily
,
a
great
column
of
water
rise
high
above
her
mast
,
and
the
air
seem
fill
with
fly
fragment
of
iron
and
wood
.
<EOS>
the
vessel
rock
and
sway
so
that
we
could
not
keep
our
foot
,
and
then
gradually
heel
over
,
cause
her
gun
to
shift
,
she
go
down
before
a
soul
on
board
could
launch
a
boat
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
the
moment
of
the
explosion
I
feel
a
sharp
twinge
in
the
back
,
and
find
that
I
have
be
strike
by
a
flying
splinter
of
steel
.
<EOS>
the
strain
of
those
hour
have
be
terrible
,
and
of
the
event
that
follow
I
can
only
recollect
two
thing
.
<EOS>
I
remember
find
myself
struggle
alone
in
the
water
with
a
shower
of
bullet
from
the
_
Dvenadsat
Apostoloff
's
_
top
send
up
little
splash
about
me
.
<EOS>
then
I
feel
my
strength
fail
,
my
limb
seem
paralysed
,
and
I
could
no
longer
strike
out
to
save
myself
.
<EOS>
abandon
all
hope
,
I
be
sink
,
when
suddenly
a
rope
be
flung
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
remember
how
frantically
I
clutch
it
,
and
that
a
few
moment
later
I
be
haul
aboard
a
torpedo
boat
;
but
for
day
afterwards
I
lay
hover
'
twixt
life
and
death
,
oblivious
to
all
.
<EOS>
I
be
one
of
the
thirteen
only
who
be
save
out
of
a
crew
of
327
brave
officer
and
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
such
a
ghastly
disaster
could
only
produce
profound
dismay
among
those
who
man
the
remaining
british
vessel
.
<EOS>
strain
every
nerve
to
uphold
the

,
with

-
begrime
hand
and

,
work
on
with
that
indomitable
energy
begotten
of
despair
.
<EOS>
regardless
of
the
awful
rain
of
shot
and
shell
,
they
reload
and
fire
with
calm
,
dogged
self
-
possession
,
the
officer
on
all
four
vessel
inspire
their
man
by
various
deed
of
valour
,
and
preserve
such
discipline
under
fire
as
none
but
british
sailor
could
.
<EOS>
the
british
naval
officer
be
full
of
undaunted
defiance
and
contempt
for
his
foe
;
but
,
above
all
,
he
be
a
strict
disciplinarian
,
and
to
this
our
country
in
a
great
measure
owe
the
supremacy
our
Navy
have
hitherto
enjoy
upon

<EOS>
during
the
fight
the

have
be
move
in

north

easterly
direction

and
although
the
Russians
be
unaware
of
the
fact
,
Her
Majesty

have
therefore
continue
in
their
course
.
<EOS>
hence
,
just
as
a
cool

spring
up
at
sundown
,
soon
after

sink

a

<EOS>
the

anxiously
through

distinguish
the
distant
crest
of
Mount

gradually
appear
against
the
clear
evening

and
then
they
know
that
they
be
off
Sardinia

outside

Gulf

<EOS>
alter
their
course
,
they
head
due
north
,
still
keep
up
a

the

<EOS>
all

suffer
frightfully
,
when
there
be
a

to
the

it

by

<EOS>
the

in

terribly
crippled

would

the

soon
fall
an

nevertheless
,
with

decimate

their

damage

the

still
continue

They
know
that

this

be
ill

for
the
defender

in

<EOS>
the

devote
by

to
the
reorganisation
of

<EOS>
large

for
on
account
of
the
many

their

<EOS>
the

go
north
without
a
most
desperate
endeavour
on
the

to
hold
them
in

<EOS>
indeed
,
if
ever
british
courage
show
itself
it
be
during
those
dark
day
.
<EOS>
advance
through
Aston
and
Perry
to
Sutton
along

send
a
large

the
high
ground
between
Wild

<EOS>
here
the
British

establish
strong
battery

but
after
some
desperate
fighting
these

<EOS>
at

Aldridge
,
the
defender
make
the
most
strenuous
effort
to
break
the
force
of
the
invader
.
<EOS>
all
be

alas

<EOS>
to

.
<EOS>
the
British

with
the
result
that
the

<EOS>
It

gain
knowledge
of
the
intention
of
the
Russians
,
take
every
precaution
in
his
power

<EOS>
Our

while
Manchester
spend
the

at

soon
after

a

close

a

but
the
British

know

part

the

up

at

closely

<EOS>
the
attack
be
desperate
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
terrible
in
a
fight
in
a
wood
at
night
.
<EOS>
the
combatant
could
see
nothing
save
an
occasional
flash
in
the
impenetrable
darkness
,
and
hoarse
cry
go
up
from
the
mysterious
inferno
.
<EOS>
neither
invader
nor
defender
could
distinguish
each
other
,
and
in
the
half
-
hour
that
follow
,
many
a
russian
shoot
his
comrade
in

for
his

<EOS>
at

the
defender
,
find
that
the
slight

bough
bring
down
a
volley
from
magazine

,
stand
motionless
,
scarcely
daring

breathe

and
wait
anxiously

until

the

withdraw

in

a

a

the
EVE

<EOS>
some
idea
of
the
gallant
conduct
of
our
volunteer
during
the
night
may
be
gather
from
the
follow
extract
from
a
letter
by
Lieutenant
John
Rowling
of
the
2nd
Volunteer
Battalion
of
the
East
Lancashire
Regiment
,
to
a
friend
a
few
day
afterwards
.
<EOS>
He
wrote--
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
no
doubt
have
hear
something
about
the
warm
work
we
have
on
the
night
before

<EOS>
the
city

as
you

be
cover
on
the
south
by
a
long
straggle
line
of
outpost
,
extend
practically
from
Stockport
to
Altrincham

<EOS>
late
in
the
afternoon
of
September
6th
we
receive
an
order
to
proceed
to
Mere

about
four
mile
from
Altrincham

have

to

the
section

on

at

half
of
our

Anderson

Wishton
as
sub

as
soon
as
I
return
to
the
piquet

after
post
the
sentry

I
send
the
former
with
two
section
to
form
a
detached
post
at
Over
Tabley

instruct
him
to
send
a
reconnoitring
patrol
as
far
down
Watling

as
he
may
consider
consistent
with
safety

<EOS>
Anderson
post
his
man

return
to
me
about
ten
o'clock
with
a
corporal

two
man
,
bring
in
a
man
who
have
be
point
out
to
him
at
Over

a
suspicious
character

<EOS>
in
fact

he

<EOS>
He
have
be
stay
at
an
inn
there
for
two

three
day

and
have
very
little
luggage

<EOS>
Anderson
have
examine
his
portmanteau
,
but
find
nothing
there
;
and
as
the
man
refuse
to
give
any
account
of
himself
,
he
make
him
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
fresh
fire
be
continually
break
out
,
therefore
I
think
it
best
to
waste
no
time
question
him
,
but
take
him
into
a
room
at
Moss
Cottage
,
where
he
be
thoroughly
search
.
<EOS>
note
be
find
upon
him
from
which
it
be
evident
that
he
have
be
obtain
information
for
the
enemy
for
some
time

and
,
better
still
,
particular
of
their
propose
operation
for
the
investment
of
Manchester

show
that
they
be
advance
in

I
send
the
prisoner

the

allot

I
also
order
to
Over

on

there
we
throw
up
barricade

hastily
construct
of
barrel

door

bank
with
earth

across

<EOS>
a
quantity
of
barb
wire
be
find
in

this
come
in
very
useful
,

we
stretch
several
length
of
it
across
the
road
on
the
off
-
side
of
the
barricade

<EOS>

there
be
under
thirty
of
us

every
man
be
determined
to
do
his
duty
unflinchingly

<EOS>
by
this
time
it
be
past
eleven
,
and
very
dark
,
yet
there
be
just
light
enough
to
train
the
gun
on
to
the
centre
of
the
cross
-
road
by
Dairyhouse
Farm

<EOS>
very
soon
we
could
hear
the
enemy
approach
,
and
as
their
spy
have
not
meet
them
outside
,
they
evidently
conclude
that
the
village
be
unoccupied
,
and
advance
in
comparatively
close
order
,
cossack
lead
,
and
the
infantry
so
close
that
there
be
practically
no
division
between
their
vanguard
and
mainguard
.
<EOS>
the
first
section
of
cossack
very
soon
find
our
first
wire
,
and
the
whole
of
their
horse
come
to
grief
.
<EOS>
those
in
the
rear
,
think
probably
that
there
be
no
other
obstruction
in
the
way
,
spur
their
horse
and
gallop
over
their
friend
,
only
to
meet
with
a
similar
fate
further
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
pioneer
double
up
,
and
begin
to
cut
the
wire
,
and
fear
that
the
infantry
in
the
rear
would
soon
deploy
,
I
give
the
order
for
independent
firing
.
<EOS>
the
Russians
stand
it
for
some
minute
,
and
attempt
to
reply
,
but
not
a
man
of
our
be
visible
,
and
they
soon
retreat
to
Tabley
Hall
,
where
I
have
no
means
of
follow
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
remember
that
we
be
all
Volunteers
,
the
Regulars
be
on
the
Stockport
flank
of
the
outpost
line

<EOS>
My
man
behave
splendidly
,

the
firing
be
excellent
from
first
to
last

"
 
<EOS>
about
the
same
time
as
the
unsuccessful
attack
be
make
on
the
outpost
at
Mere
<EOS>
,
the
british
line
be
break
through
at
Heald
Green

Appletree

<EOS>
a
cavalry
patrol
,
support
by

be
feel
its
way
along
the
road
to
Wilmslow

have
pass
Willow
Farm
,
at
which
point
the
road
run
beside
the
railway
embankment

<EOS>
the
storm
have
burst
,
the
thunder
roll
incessantly
,
rain
fall
in
torrent
,
and
the
lightning
play
about
them
,
cause
their
arm
to
gleam
in
its
vivid
flash
.
 
<EOS>
slowly
,
and
without
undue
noise
,
the
patrol
be
wend
its
way
up
the
hill
towards
Finney
Green
,
when
suddenly
there
be
a
terrific
rattle
of
musketry
,
and
they
discover
to
their
surprise
that
the
enemy
,
who
be
occupy
the
embankment
of
the
north
-
Western
Railway
on
their
left
,
be
pour
upon
them
a
fire
sufficient
to
blanch
the
cheek
of
the
brave
among
them

<EOS>
along
the
embankment
for
a
mile
or
more
be
station
infantry
with
magazine
rifle
,
and
in
addition
they
have
bring
two
machine
gun
into
play
with
appalling
effect
.
<EOS>
so
sudden
do
this
gall
fire
open
upon
them
,
that
man
and
horse
fall
without
be
able
to
fire
a
shot
in
return
.
<EOS>
british
infantry
,
however
,
stand
their
ground
,
and
as
the
lightning
flash
,
disclose
the
position
of
the
enemy
,
every
Russian
who
dare
to
stand
up
or
show
himself
be
promptly
pick
off
.
<EOS>
but
against
the
awful
rain
of
deadly
bullet
eject
from
the
machine
gun
,
at
the
rate
of
600
a
minute
,
no
force
could
make
a
successful
defence
.
 
<EOS>
many
british
hero
fall
pierce
by
a
dozen
bullet
;
still
their
comrade
,
seek
what
shelter
<EOS>
they
could
,
continue
the
defensive
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
over
the
dismal
muddy
road
the
survivor
of
the
cavalry
gallop
back
,
and
quickly
report
to
the
commander
of
the
piquet
at
Appletree
that
the
enemy
be
in
strong
force
on
the
other
side
of
the
embankment
between
Oaklands
and
Wilmslow
Park
,
and
as
they
have
hear
a
train
run
into
Wilmslow
Station
and
stop
,
it
be
evident
that
the
enemy
have
reopen
the
line
from
Crewe
,
and
intend
concentrate
part
of
their
reinforcement
to
the
general
advance
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
the
enemy
have
succeed
in
cut
all
the
telegraph
line
in
the
district
,
and
have
now
obtain
complete
control
over
the
railway
,
be
most
alarming
,
and
the
outlook
of
the
defender
be
render
doubly
serious
by
the
large
force
they
be
compel
to
keep
east
of
Stockport
,
and
in
the
Peak
district
,
to
prevent
the
invader
get
round
to
attack
Manchester
from
the
north

<EOS>
on
receipt
of
the
news
of
the
disaster
to
the
patrol

the
commander
of
the
piquet
at
Appletree
immediately
send
information
to
the
commander
of
the
piquet
post
at
the
railway
station
at
Cheadle
Hulme
;
but
by
a
strange
oversight
,
due
no
doubt
to
the
excitement
of
the
moment
,
send
no
report
to
the
commander
of
the
outpost
.
<EOS>
the
infantry
engage
the
Russians
on
the
embankment
,
though
exhibit
most
gallant
courage
,
be
so
exposed
that
it
be
little
wonder
they
be
soon
completely
annihilate
,
only
half
a
dozen
escaping
.
 
<EOS>
the
enemy
must
have
detrain
a
large
number
of
troop
at
Wilmslow
,
for
the
british
cavalry
scout
be
quickly
follow
up
by
Cossacks

the
Tsar
's
Dragoons

<EOS>
quickly
the
sentry
between
Heald
Green
and
Appletree
be
drive
back
on
their
piquet

the
latter
extending
in
skirmish
order

<EOS>
such
a
manoeuvre
,
however
,
prove
fatal
in
the
darkness
and
on
the
heavy
ploughed
land
over
which
they
be
fight
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
very
few
succeed
in
reach
the
support

when
they
do

they
all
fall
back
hurriedly
on
the
reserve
at
Pimgate

<EOS>
then
the
commander
of
the
piquet
at
Cheadle
Hulme
Station
,
find
that
he
must
inevitably
be
attack
by
road

rail

set
the

on
fire

with
the
assistance
of
the
railway
official
blow
up
a
large
portion

permanent
way
with
dynamite

thus
cut
off

of

this
accomplish

he
fall
back
upon
his
support
at
Adswood

they
,
at
about
2
A.M.

retreat
with
the
reserve
to
the
embankment
of
the
north

Western
Railway
which
carry
the
line
from

Bridge

up

another
from

a
third
from

to

throughout
the
night
the
defender
be
in
hourly
expectation
that
an
attack
would
be
make
upon
their
position

with
the
object
of
invest
Stockport
as
a
preliminary
to
the
assault
on
the
defensive
line
north
of

the
enemy
apparently
have
other
object
,

the
disaster

the
british
cavalry

on
the
Wilmslow
road
be
,
unfortunately
,
follow
by
a
second
and
more
serious
one

<EOS>
the
Cossacks

that
follow
the
british
cavalry
scout
overtook
them
just
as
they
have
join
their

a
short
distance

about
half

the
force
of
British
cavalry
and
infantry
be
gradually
draw
into
a
cunningly

devise
trap
,
and
then
there
suddenly
appear
a
great
force
of
Russians

who
simply
sweep
down
upon
them
,
slaughter
the
whole
of

with
brutal
ferocity

It

with
admirable

the
fugitive

down
the

<EOS>
thus
they
fall
into
a
trap
,
for
as
soon

recover
themselves

and

a
dash
to
reorganise
their

two
British

<EOS>
the

desperate
one

Cheadle
Hulme

where

<EOS>
so
great

the
slaughter

that
it

in
this
engagement
alone

after
the
recapture
of
the
gun
by
the
British

over
4000
Russians

shoot
down
and
3000

<EOS>
the
Russians

find
how
desperate

the
resistance
,
and
how
heavily
they
be
lose
,
quickly
bring
up
strong
reinforcement
upon

and
,
after
a
fiercely

afterwards

and
keep
up
a
hot
fire
from

where

<EOS>
by
this
mean
,
although
they
be
unable
to
save
Cheadle
from

burn
,
they
succeed
,
by
reason
of
the
excellence
of
their
position
and
the
admirable
tactic
they
display
,
in
mow
down
another
2000

<EOS>
in
this

It

but
one
of

the
conflict
which

westward
from

decisive
rush
over
the
Mersey
to
Stretford
,
intend
to
take
that
place

by
that
route
upon
Manchester
.
<EOS>
the
defender
,
who
have
be
warn
of
this
through
spy
,
await
their
chance
,
and
suddenly
,
when
the
Russians
least
expect
an
attack
,
a
body
of
British
cavalry
,
back
by
infantry
,
cross
the
Mersey
,
and
sweep
down
the
level
turnpike
road
to
Sale
,
come
upon
their
opponent
before
they
be
aware
of
their
presence
.
<EOS>
the
effect
of
this
be
frightful
.
<EOS>
a
small
body
of
British
Hussars
,
with
some
Lancashire
Yeomanry
,
make
a
splendid
charge
,
exhibit
magnificent
courage
,
and
cut
their
way
clean
through
the
russian
line
with
irresistible
force
;
while
the
infantry
,
advance
cautiously
,
and
take
every
advantage
of
the
small
cover
afford
on
that
level
country
,
pour
forth
a
deadly
rifle
fire
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
so
gallant
be
this
charge
,
that
the
Tsar
's
force
be
almost
annihilate
.
<EOS>
They
endeavour
to
make
a
stand
near
the
cross

road
lead
from
Carrington
Moss
,
but
the
rifle
fire
of
the
defender
be
so
heavy
that
they
drop
by
hundred
under
the
deadly
rain
of
british
bullet
.
 
<EOS>
the
disaster
to
the
Russians
be
signal
back
by
them
to
their
reserve
at
Tatton
Park
and
around
Knutsford
,
have
the
effect
of

up
an
enormous
force
of
infantry

<EOS>
signaller

at
work
in
all
direction
,
and
those
who
watch
the
progress
of
the
action
find
the
next
two
hour
full
of
exciting
moment
.
<EOS>
It
be
apparent
at
once
that
the
Russians
have
mark
out
Stretford
as
the
gate
by
which
they
intend
to
enter
Manchester
,
but
they
must
have
be
mislead
by
their
spy
as
to
the
strength
of
the
defender
in
this

<EOS>
indeed
,
if
they
have
survey
the
whole
of
the
southern
line
defend
the
city
,
they
could
not
have
discover
a
point
more
strongly
fortified
;
therefore
it
be
a
somewhat
curious
fact
that
they
should
have
concentrate
their
force
upon
that
part
.
<EOS>
possibly
it
be
because
they
have
form
an
opinion
by
study
their
ordnance
Maps
--
so
generously
provide
for
them
by
the
British
Department
of
Agriculture
at
a
cost
of
one
shill
each
--
that
,
if
they
succeed
in
break
the
defence
at
Stretford
,
they
would
also
secure
the
road
run
in
a
circular
direction
up
to
Barton
,
by
which
mean
they
could
enter
Manchester
by
way
of
Eccles
,
Pendleton
,
and
Salford
at
the
same
time
as
the
march
through
Trafford
.
<EOS>
such
a
design
be
,
of
course
,
cleverly
plan
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
admit
that
,
from
a
strategical
point
of
view
,
the
taking
of
Stretford
would
mean
the
fall
of
Manchester
,
a
fact
which
the
russian
command
officer
have
not
overlook
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
soldier
of
the
Tsar
have
reckon
without
their
host
.
<EOS>
They
only
see
along
the
Mersey
a
thin
and
apparently
weak
line
of
defence
,
a
massing
of
defender
without
undue
ostentation
and
without
any
particular
show
of
strength
.
<EOS>
a
balloon
send
up
by
the
Russians
to
reconnoitre
from
Sale
have
be
fire
at
and
bring
down
by
the
defender
,
but
with
this
exception
scarcely
a
shot
have
be
fire
north
of
the
Mersey
.
<EOS>
briton
be
watch
and

<EOS>
Their
foe
,
ridicule
the
idea
that
a
town
like
Manchester
,
almost
utterly
devoid
of
position
whereon
battery
may
be
establish
,
could
be
successfully
defend
,
therefore
keep
up
a
desultory
fire
upon
the
british
detachment
that
have
sweep
away
their
advance
guard

in
the
meantime
cover

and
two
company
of
engineer

with

section

as
well
as
a

party
and
two
field
hospital

<EOS>
the
british
detachment
that
have
cross
the
river
be
,
however
,
unaware
of
the
enemy
's
intention
until
too
late
.
<EOS>
the
manoeuvre
of
the
Russians
be
be
watch
by
a
british
balloon
send
up
from
Old
Trafford
,
but
the
signal
make
by
the
aeronaut
be
unfortunately
unobserved
by
the

so
desperately
be
they
fight
;
otherwise
a
disaster
which
befall
them
on
the
sudden
rush
of
the
enemy
towards
the
river
may
possibly
have
be
avert
.
<EOS>
however
,
no
blame
could
be
attach
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
detachment
.
<EOS>
the

act
their

bravely
,
and
display
that
courage
of
which
the
Briton
speak
with
justifiable
pride
,
even
though
,
alas
!
<EOS>
they
fall
,
every
one
of
them
fight
till
the

,
their
body
be
afterwards
frightfully
mangle
by
horse

hoofs
,
as
hundred

Cossacks
ride
over
them
.
<EOS>
not
a

of
that

each
one
have
once
more
show
the
world
what
pluck
and
courage
could

a

left
,
and
three
brigade
of
cavalry
in
the
centre
,
the
Russian
General
strike
hard
at
the
british
line
between
Stretford
and
Chorlton
-
with
-
Hardy
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
beyond
Ashton
-
on
-
Mersey
<EOS>
the
battle
be
also
grow
in
intensity
,
and
rifle
and
cannon
be
noisily
engage
.
<EOS>
a
strong
force
of
russian
infantry
be
at
once
push
across
to
Partington
,
where
they
succeed
in
cross
the
Ship
Canal
and
the
Mersey
,
subsequently
join
their
advance
guard
at
Lower
Irlam
.
 
<EOS>
the
british
reserve
at
Newton
-
in
-
Makerfield
,
however
,
sweep
down
upon
them
,
and
a
terrible
fight
quickly
ensue
.
<EOS>
the
defender
advance
very
steadily
by
section
rush
,
keep
under
good
firing
discipline
as
they
go
,
and
the
enemy
be
drive
on
towards
Flixton
,
where
they
be
simply
sweep
away
by
the
12-pounder
battery
establish
there
,
while
at
the
same
time
their
wire
cross
the
Mersey
be
cut
,
and
communication
with
their
headquarters
thus
interrupt
.
 
<EOS>
while
this
be
in
progress
,
another
and
more
important
attack
be
be
make
on
Stretford
.
<EOS>
the
heavy
artillery
fire
and
the
affair
of
outpost
in
the
early
stage
of
the
battle
have
be
follow
by
a
carefully
-
regulate
long
-
range
fire
of
infantry
on
both
side
.
 
<EOS>
the
tactic
the
Russians
have
display
be
as
follows:--They
have
gradually
develop
their
infantry
in
front
of
the
Stretford
position
,
and
bring
their
pontoon
in
readiness
for
a
dash
over
the
river
.
<EOS>
then
,
after
some
tentative
movement
,
design
to
feel
the
strength
of
our
force
mass
at
this
important
point
,
they
apparently
determine
to
carry
it
at
any
cost
.
 
<EOS>
on
their
right
flank
the
enemy
be
lose
very
heavily
.
<EOS>
a
telegraphic
message
receive
at
Altrincham
give
the
headquarters
alarm
news
of
constant
reverse
.
<EOS>
a
strong
force
of
infantry
marching
along
the
bank
of
the
Etherow
from
Compstall
,
intend
to
get
to
Hyde
by
way
of
Mottram
and
Godley
Junction
,
have
be
attack
by
british
infantry
and
a
couple
of
9-pounders
,
and
totally
annihilate
;
while
at
the
same
time
,
about
a
thousand
man
attack
a
british
battery
on
the
hill
at
Charlesworth
have
be
cut
up
and
force
to
retreat
,
be
follow
by
some
Lancers
right
down
to
Ludworth
Houses
,
where
they
be
nearly
all
kill
or
wound
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
time
without
number
during
that
memorable
day
the
Russians
make
fierce
attack
upon
our
position
on
the
edge
of
the
Peak
district
,
but
on
each
occasion
they
be
hurl
back
with
fearful
loss
by
the
thin
line
of
defender
hold
the
high
ground
.
 
<EOS>
a
battery
we
have
establish
on
the
crown
of
the
hill
at
Werneth
be
charge
again
and
again
by
Cossacks
and
Dragoons
,
but
our
man
,
display
cool
courage
at
the
critical
moment
,
fight
desperately
,
and
mow
down
the
foe
in
a
manner
that
be
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
the
Russians
,
have
decide
to
carry
Stretford
,
be
make
vigorous
demonstration
towards
the
Peak
,
and
in
the
direction
of
Flixton
,
in
order
to
distract
our
attention
.
<EOS>
They
occupy
us
at
many
point
in
the
vast
semicircle
,
and
by
thus
engage
us
all
along
the
line
,
endeavour
apparently
to
prevent
us
from
reinforce
the
point
at
Stretford
which
they
intend
gain
.
<EOS>
both
invader
and
defender
gradually
extend
in
order
to
meet
outflanking
movement
,
and
this
be
the
cause
of
another
sudden
british
success
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
foregone
conclusion
that
such
an
extension
would
exceed
the
limit
of
defensive
power
on
one
side
or
the
other
,
and
then
blow
would
be
strike
with
the
object
of
break
the
too
extended
line
.
 
<EOS>
what
occur
be
,
perhaps
,
best
relate
by
one
of
the
special
correspondent
of
the
_
Daily
News
_
,
who
,
in
his
account
of
the
battle
,
publish
two
day
later
,
said--
 
<EOS>
"
about
three
o'clock
I
be
at
Barton
with
the
force
of
infantry
who
be
hold
the
road
to
Warrington
,
when
we
unexpectedly
receive
telegraphic
information
from
headquarters
of
a
rapid
extension
of
the
enemy
's
left
flank
.
<EOS>
a
brigade
which
I
accompany
be
push
on
at
once
down
to
Hollinfare
,
where
we
reinforce
those
who
have
be
so
successful
in
cut
up
the
enemy
at
Lower
Irlam
half
an
hour
before
.
<EOS>
We
then
extend
along
the
Liverpool
Road
,
past
Warrington
,
as
far
as
Widnes
.
<EOS>
I
remain
with
a
small
detachment
at
Hollinfare
await
development
,
when
suddenly
we
be
inform
that
the
enemy
have
throw
a
pontoon
bridge
over
the
Mersey
at
its
confluence
with
the
Bollin
,
and
that
a
great
body
of
infantry
,
with
machine
gun
,
have
leave
Lymm
,
where
they
have
be
lie
inactive
,
and
be
already
cross
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
more
than
one
hundred
of
us
,
mostly
man
of
the
Loyal
Lancashire
from
Preston
and
a
few
of
the
Manchester
Regiment
;
but
at
the
word
of
command
we
dash
down
the
road
for
nearly
a
mile
,
and
then
leave
it
,
double
across
the
field
to
Rixton
Old
Hall
,
where
we
obtain
cover
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
Russians
have
choose
the
most
advantageous
spot
they
could
find
to
cross
,
for
on
the
opposite
bank
there
be
a
small
thick
wood
,
and
in
this
they
remain
quite
conceal
until
they
suddenly
dash
out
and
get
across
.
<EOS>
number
have
already
reach
our
side
and
be
deploy
,
when
our
rifle
speak
out
sharply
,
and
,
judge
from
the
manner
in
which
the
enemy
be
expose
,
our
fire
be
quite
unexpected
.
<EOS>
about
thirty
of
our
man
,
kneel
behind
a
wall
,
keep
up
a
vigorous
fire
,
empty
their
magazine
with
excellent
effect
upon
the
grey
-
coat
swarm
over
the
improvised
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
"
still
it
be
impossible
to
keep
them
back
,
for
the
force
effect
a
passage
<EOS>
be
very
much
large
than
we
have
anticipate
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
few
minute
later
,
have
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
attack
,
our
signaller
open
communication
with
Higher
Irlam
,
and
the
information
be
convey
on
to
Barton
,
whence
the
heliograph
flash
the
news
down
to
Stretford
.
 
<EOS>
"
suddenly
,
however
,
in
the
midst
of
a
shady
clump
of
tree
there
be
a
loud
rattle
and
continuous
flashing
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
have
bring
a
10-barrelled
Nordenfelt
into
play
,
and
it
be
rain
bullet
upon
us
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
a
minute
!
 
<EOS>
"
the
wall
behind
which
I
be
crouch
be
strike
by
a
perfect
hail
of
lead
,
and
there
be
a
loud
whistling
about
my
ear
that
be
particularly
disconcert
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
our
man
have
in
their
sudden
dash
for
the
defence
secure
an
excellent
position
,
and
only
three
be
kill
and
five
wound
by
this
sudden
outburst
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
struggle
during
the
next
few
minute
be
the
most
desperate
I
have
ever
witness
.
<EOS>
at
the
moment
of
peril
our
man
display
magnificent
pluck
.
<EOS>
They
seem
utterly
unconcerned
at
their
imminent
danger
,
and
lie
or
crouch
,
fire
independently
with
calm
precision
.
<EOS>
a
dozen
or
so
fall
wounded
,
however
,
and
a
sergeant
who
knelt
next
to
me
,
and
who
be
shoot
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
,
be
shoot
through
the
heart
,
and
fall
dead
while
in
the
act
of
make
an
observation
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
man
who
have
attack
us
be
a
fierce
-
looking
set
,
mostly
compose
of
Tchuwakes
and
Mordwa
from
the
central
district
of
the
Volga
,
and
renowne
as
among
the
good
infantry
that
the
Tsar
can
command
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rifles
bristle
from
every
bit
of
cover
around
us
,
and
it
be
really
marvellous
that
we
score
such
success
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
only
by
reason
of
the
courageous
conduct
of
every
individual
man
that
the
successful
stand
be
make
against
such
overwhelming
number
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
if
the
enemy
force
the
passage
and
annihilate
us
,
they
would
then
be
enable
to
outflank
our
force
,
and
get
round
to
Eccles
and
Pendlebury
--
a
disaster
which
may
result
in
the
rapid
investment
of
Manchester
.
<EOS>
therefore
we
fight
on
,
determined
to
do
our
very
utmost
to
stem
the
advance
tide
of
destroyer
.
 
<EOS>
"
time
after
time
our
rifle
rattle
,
and
time
after
time
the
deadly
Nordenfelt
send
its
hail
of
bullet
around
us
.
<EOS>
presently
,
however
,
we
hear
increase
fire
on
our
right
,
and
then
welcome
signal
reach
us
from
Martinscroft
Green
.
<EOS>
We
greet
them
with
loud
cheering
,
for
a
force
of
our
infantry
and
cavalry
have
return
along
the
road
from
Warrington
,
and
,
work
in
extended
order
,
be
bear
down
upon
the
foe
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
cease
firing
in
that
direction
,
and
ere
long
we
have
the
satisfaction
of
see
the
enemy
's
pontoon
blow
up
,
and
then
,
with
their
retreat
cut
off
,
they
become
demoralise
,
and
be
drive
into
the
open
,
where
we
pick
them
off
so
rapidly
that
scarcely
one
man
of
the
1500
who
have
set
his
foot
upon
the
Lancashire
bank
survive
.
 
<EOS>
"
from
first
to
last
our
man
fight
magnificently
.
<EOS>
the
whole
engagement
be
a
brilliant
and
almost
unequalled
display
of
genuine
british
bravery
,
and
all
I
can
hope
be
that
the
defender
of
London
will
act
their
part
with
equal
courage
when
the
decisive
struggle
come
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
.
 
<EOS>
the
FATE
of
the
VANQUISHED
.
  
<EOS>
while
this
vigorous
attack
on
the
right
flank
be
in
progress
,
the
enemy
make
a
sudden
dash
upon
Stretford
.
 
<EOS>
the
edge
of
the
town
itself
--
or
rather
suburb
--
lie
but
a
short
distance
from
the
Mersey
,
and
the
turnpike
road
run
straight
away
over
the
river
through
Sale
and
Altrincham
to
Northwich
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
town
near
the
river
a
road
lead
down
from
Barton
join
the
main
road
,
and
at
the
junction
be
a
large
red

brick
modern
hotel
,
the
Old
Cock
,
while
adjoin
be
the
Manchester
Tramway
Company
's
stable
and
terminus
.
<EOS>
at
a
little
distance
behind
lie
a
high
embankment
,
which
carry
the
railway
from
Manchester
to
Liverpool
,
while
the
Mersey
itself
,
though
not
wide
,
have
steep
bank
with
earthwork
throw
up
to
prevent
flood
.
<EOS>
hence
the
force
hold
this
position
find
ready
-
make
defence
which
be
now
of
the
utmost
value
.
 
<EOS>
the
defender
here
include
three

of
Royal
Artillery
,
one
battalion
of
the
Manchester
Regiment
,
the
2nd
Volunteer
Battalion
of
the
same
regiment
,
and
one
of
the
Lancashire
Fusiliers
,

of
Engineers
,

<EOS>
trench
have
be
dig
at
various
point
,
and
earthwork
throw
up
all
along
the
line
from
Chorlton
over
to
Flixton
.
<EOS>
across
the
junction
of
the
two
road
opposite
the
Old
Cock
a
great
barricade
have
be
construct
,
and
behind
this
be
a
powerful
battery
that
command
the
level
country
away
towards
Altrincham
.
<EOS>
the
bridge
carry
the
road
and
railway
over
the
river
have
both
be
demolish
by
engineer
,
and
many
other
precaution
have
be
take
to
prevent
the
enemy
force
a
passage
across
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
with
a
swiftness
that
be
surprising
,
the
expect
assault
be
make
.
<EOS>
Its
strength
be
terrific
,
and
the
carnage
on
both
side
appalling
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
dash
across
be
effect
by
the
Russians
from
the
rifle
range
near
Old
Hall
,
and
this
be
rapidly
follow
by
another
from
the
bank
opposite
the
battery
at
Stretford
,
while
further
down
a
third
attack
be
make
near
Mersey
House
,
close
to
Ashton
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
three
,
the
strong
,
of
course
,
be
that
upon
Stretford
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
have
,
by
a
good
deal
of
neat
manoeuvring
,
bring
their
main
body
within
the
triangle
bound
on
the
one
side
by
the
road
from
Cheadle
to
Altrincham
,
on
the
second
by
the
road
from
the
latter
place
to
the
river
,
and
the
third
by
the
river
itself
.
 
<EOS>
pontoon
be
float
at
many
point
,
and
while
some
cavalry
ford
the
river
,
infantry
and
artillery
rapidly
cross
in
the
face
of
a
terrific
fire
which
be
pour
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
smokeless
powder
be
use
,
the
position
of
the
invader
be
not
obscure
,
and
it
could
be
see
that
the
British
be
effect
terrible
execution
.
<EOS>
hundred
of
the
foe
who
be
in
the
act
of
cross
be
pick
off
,
and
shell
fall
upon
the
pontoon
destroy
them
.
<EOS>
the
latter
,
however
,
be
quickly
replace
,
and
the
force
of
the
Tsar
,
by
reason
of
the
overwhelming
number
that
have
hurl
themselves
upon
Stretford
,
succeed
,
after
a
desperately

contest
fight
,
in
break
the
line
of
defence
between
Chorlton
-
with
-
Hardy
and
Fallowfield
,
and
advance
by
short
rush
upon
Manchester
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
british
infantry
in
their
trench
behave
splendidly
,
and
make
the
road
from
Old
Hall
at
Sale
right
along
to
Partington
quite
untenable
,
so
the
continuous
advance
of
the
enemy
cost
them
very
dearly
.
 
<EOS>
russian
shell
burst
in
Stretford
kill
and
injure
large
number
of
the
defender
.
<EOS>
two
of
them
strike
the
Old
Cock
in
rapid
succession
,
almost
completely
demolish
it
,
but
the
debris
be
quickly
man
,
and
rifle
soon
speak
from
its
ruin
wall
.
<EOS>
again
,
a
shell
explode
in
the
large
tram
stable
,
set
a
hay
store
on
fire
,
and
this
burn
furiously
,
while
away
in
the
centre
of
the
town
the
Public
Library
and
a
number
of
shop
in
the
vicinity
have
also
be
ignite
in
a
similar
manner
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
the
thousand
of
grey
-
coat
swarm
over
the
country
fall
in
such
enormous
number
upon
the
british
rifle
pit
on
the
Mersey
bank
,
that
the
first
line
of
defence
be
at
length
utterly
break
down
;
but
in
do
this
the
enemy
's
front
have
become
much
expose
,
whereupon
the
Maxims
on
the
railway
embankment
between
the
river
and
Barton
suddenly
burst
forth
a
perfect
hail
of
bullet
,
and
in
a
short
time
a
whole
division
of
russian
infantry
,
cavalry
,
and
artillery
have
be
literally
sweep
out
of
existence
.
 
<EOS>
the
battery
down
in
the
Stretford
Road
,
combine
with
those
on
the
embankment
,
have
up
to
this
moment
play
great
havoc
with
the
foe
than
any
other
.
<EOS>
the
man
of
the
Manchester
Regiment
,
both
Regulars
and
Volunteers
,
be
display
the
great
coolness
;
but
unfortunately
the
Lancashire
Fusiliers
and
the

foregone
conclusion
,
and
we
know
that
to
annoy
the
enemy
and
delay
their
landing
would
be
the
extent
of
our
resistance
.
<EOS>
some
of
our
gun
be
,
of
course
,
of
comparatively
recent
date
,
and
our
supply
of
ammunition
be
fair
,
but
the
Volunteer
gun
be
antiquated
40-pounder
muzzleloader
,
which
ought
to
have
be
withdraw
year
ago
,
and
the
gunner
have
have
very
little
field
training
.
<EOS>
the
arrangement
for
horse
the
gun
be
also
very
inefficient
,
and
they
have
no
waggon
or
transport
.
<EOS>
Most
of
our
force
have
be
draw
south
,
the
only
infantry
available
be
a
battalion
and
a
half
--
really
a
provisional
battalion
,
for
it
be
compose
of
portion
of
two
Volunteer
rifle
regiment
,
with
a
detachment
of
regular
.
<EOS>
Our
regular
artillery
detachment
be
,
unfortunately
,
very
inadequate
,
for
<EOS>
although
the
armament
of
the
fort
have
be
recently
strengthen
,
the
force
have
be
weaken
just
before
the
outbreak
of
war
by
the
despatch
of
an
indian
draft
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
apparent
that
the
enemy
would
not
attempt
to
destroy
our
position
,
but
land
and
carry
it
by
assault
;
therefore
,
while
the
Inchkeith
gun
keep
them
at
bay
,
we
undermine
our
fort
,
open
our
magazine
,
and
get
ready
for
a
little
target
practice
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
Volunteer
battery
send
eastward
have
be
order
to
do
what
execution
they
could
,
and
then
,
in
the
case
of
a
reverse
,
to
retire
through
Portobello
and
Duddingston
to
Edinburgh
,
and
those
on
the
west
be
to
go
inland
to
Ratho
;
while
we
be
resolve
to
hold
the
fort
as
long
as
possible
,
and
if
at
last
we
be
compel
to
retire
we
intend
to
blow
up
the
place
before
leave
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
soon
as
we
find
the
russian
flagship
within
range
,
we
open
fire
upon
her
,
and
this
action
cause
a
perfect
storm
of
projectile
to
be
direct
upon
us
.
<EOS>
the
town
be
soon
in
flame
,
the
shipping
in
the
harbour
sink
,

the
martello
tower
be
blow
to
piece

Our

very
soon
bring
into
requisition
,

by
its
aid
some
of
the
boat
of
the
enemy
's
transport
be
sink
,
while
other
come
to
grief
on
the
Black
Rocks

by
this
time
the
enemy
have
turn
their
search
-
light
in
every
direction
where
they
could
see
firing
,
and
very
soon
our
Volunteer
battery
be
silence
,
and
then
Granton
harbour
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy
's
landing
party

<EOS>
have
first
render
their
gun
useless
,
the
survivor
fall
back
to
Corstorphine
Hill
,
outside
Edinburgh
,
and
we
soon
afterwards
receive
intelligence
that
the
Russians
be
land
at
Granton
in
thousand
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
although
our
garrison
be
so
weak
and
inexperienced
,
we
nevertheless
keep
up
a
vigorous
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
see
how
Inchkeith
Fort
have
be
silence
,
and
how
our
Volunteer
battery
have
be
destroy
,
and
know
that
sooner
or
later
we
must
share
the
same
fate
,
and
abandon
our
position
.
<EOS>
as
boatload
after
boatload
of
Russians
attempt
to
land
,
we
either
sink
them
by
shot
from
our
gun
or
sweep
them
with
a
salvo
of
bullet
from
our
Maxims
;
yet
as
soon
as
we
have
hurl
back
one

party
other
take
its
place

<EOS>
"
many
be
the
heroic
deed
our
gunner
perform
that
night
,
as
hand
to
hand
they
fight
,
and
annihilate
the
Russians
who
succeed
in
landing

in
this
frightful
struggle
we
lose
heavily
,

at
length
,
when
all
hope
of
an
effective
defence
have

we
place
electric
wire
in

the
order

this
we

half
our

<EOS>
the
Russians

the

a
quarter

hour

for
several

the

around

we
stand
seem

with
fly
debris

the

exciting

there
be
a
cessation

quickly

however
,
the
bombardment
be
resume

although
we
totally
annihilate
the

we
fall
back

at

gain
the

then
,
when
all
preparation
be
satisfactorily
complete
,
the
six
man
throw
themselves
upon
the
grass
to
snatch
an
hour
's
repose
,
while
the
officer
return
to
their
previous
position
,
lean
against
the
broken
fence
,
and
gravely
discuss
their
proposal
for
the
morrow
's
gigantic
sensation
.
<EOS>
the
elder
of
the
two
be
explain
to
his
companion
the
nature
of
the
_
coup
_
which
they
intend
to
deliver
,
and
the
mode
in
which
it
would
be
make
.
<EOS>
so
engross
be
they
in
the
contemplation
of
the
appalling
result
that
would
accrue
<EOS>
,
they
do
not
observe
that
they
be
stand
beneath
a
small
square
hole
in
the
wall
of
the
barn
;
neither
do
they
notice
that
from
this
aperture
a
dark
head
protrude
for
a
second
and
then
quick
as
lightning
withdraw
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
like
a
shadow
,
and
disappear
instantly
!
 
<EOS>
ten
minute
later
a
mysterious
figure
be
creep
cautiously
along
under
the
hedge
of
the
high
road
to
Newington
in
the
direction
of
the
british
line
.
<EOS>
crawl
along
the
grass
,
and
pause
now
and
then
with
his
ear
to
the
ground
,
listening
,
he
advance
by
short
,
silent
stage
,
exercise
the
great
caution
,
<EOS>
well
aware
that
death
would
be
his
fate
<EOS>
should
he
be
discover
.
<EOS>
in
wade
the
Braid
Burn
he
almost
betray
himself
to
a
russian
sentry
;
but
at
last
,
after
travel
for
over
an
hour
,
risk
discovery
at
any
moment
,
he
at
length
pass
the
british
outpost
beyond
Liberton
,
and
ascend
the
Braid
Hills
to
the
headquarters
.
 
<EOS>
the
story
he
tell
the
General
commanding
be
at
first
look
upon
as
ludicrous
.
<EOS>
in
the
dim
candlelight
in
the
General
's
tent
he
certainly
look
a
disreputable
derelict
,
his
old
and
tattered
clothe
wet
through
,
his
hand
cut
by
stone
and
bleeding
,
and
his
face
half
cover
with
mud
.
<EOS>
the
three
officer
who
be
with
the
General
laugh
when
he
dash
in
excitedly
,
and
relate
the
conversation
he
have
overhear
;
yet
when
he
subsequently
go
on
to
describe
in
detail
what
he
have
witness
,
and
when
they
remember
that
this
tramp
be
an
artilleryman
who
have
long
ago
be
conspicuous
by
his
bravery
at
El
Teb
,
and
an
ingenious
inventor
,
their
expression
of
amusement
give
way
to
one
of
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
the
General
,
who
have
be
write
,
thoughtfully
tap
the
little
camp
table
before
him
with
his
pen
.
"
<EOS>
so
they
intend
to
destroy
us
and
wreck
the
city
by
that
mean
,
now
that
their
legitimate
tactic
have
fail
!
<EOS>
I
can
scarcely
credit
that
such
be
their
intention
;
yet
if
they
should
be
successful
--
<EOS>
if"--
 
<EOS>
"
but
they
will
not
be
successful
,
sir

<EOS>
if
you
will
send
some
one
to
assist
me
,
and
allow
me
to
act
as
I
think
fit

I
will
frustrate
their
dastardly
design

the
city
shall
be

<EOS>
"
You
be
at

to

You

I
have
perfect
confidence
in
you

Mackenzie

"
reply
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
,
however
,
mention
a
word
of
the
enemy
's
intention
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
It
would
terrify
the
man
;
and
although
I
do
not
doubt
their
bravery
,
yet
the
knowledge
of
such
a
horrible
fate
hang
over
them
must
necessarily
increase
their
anxiety
,
and
thus
prevent
them
from
do
their
good
.
<EOS>
We
be
weak
,
but
remember
we
be
all
briton
.
<EOS>
now
come
,
"
he
add
,
"
sit
there
,
upon
that
box
,
and
explain
at
once
what
be
your
scheme
of
defence
against
this
extraordinary
attack
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
the
fearless
man
to
whom
the
General
have
entrust
the
defence
of
Edinburgh
obey
,
and
commence
to
explain
what
mean
he
intend
to
take
--
a
desperate
but
well
-
devise
plan
,
which
draw
forth
word
of
the
high
commendation
from
the
command
officer
and
those
with
him
.
<EOS>
They
know
that
the
fate
of
Edinburgh
hang
in
the
balance
,
and
that
if
the
city
be
take
it
would
be
the
first
step
towards
their
downfall

the

<EOS>
this
man
Mackenzie
have

again

back
another
lever

twice
the

and
the
gun
to

hissing
sound

like
escape
steam

<EOS>
then
he
step
back
to
the
officer

saying--

"
I

It

<EOS>
the
gunner

Dawn

<EOS>
They
all
know
the

rise
from
behind
the
ridge

great
dark
mass

look
almost
spectral
in

<EOS>
for
a
moment
it
seem
to

and
swing
as

automatically
away
into

succession

<EOS>
none
dare
to
breathe
.
<EOS>
the
excitement
be
intense

<EOS>
They
watch
the
effect
upon
the
russian
balloon

but
to
their
dismay
see
it
still
rapidly

and
unharmed

<EOS>
It
have
alter
its

FRIGHTFUL
SLAUGHTER

It

severely
attack

<EOS>
exultant
over

very

<EOS>
such
an
attack
be

of

very

it

smart
manoeuvre
on

their
destructive
campaign
through

street
of
Edinburgh

<EOS>
this
bold
move
on
the
part
of
the
defender
be
totally
unexpected
by
the
foe
,
which
account
for
the
frightful
loss
of
life
that

clever
tactic

all

away

our

narrowly

the
manner
in

<EOS>
"
as
the
railway
have
not
be
destroy
,
I
think
that
possibly
the
invader
intend
to
use
the
line
_
via
_
Mid
-
Calder
,
and
therefore
examine
the
station
closely
.
<EOS>
while
engage
in
this
,
one
of
the
Engineers
suddenly
discover
a
wire
very
carefully
conceal
along
the
line
,
and
as
we
follow
it
up
500
yard
each
way
,
and
could
find
no
connection
with
the
instrument
at
the
station
office
<EOS>
,
I
at
once
conclude
that
it
be
the
enemy
's
field
telegraph
,
form
mean
of
communication
between
their
headquarter
at
Airdrie
and
the
division
that
still
remain
in

Pentlands

<EOS>
"
cut
the
wire
,
and
attach
the
end
to
the
instrument
in
the
station
,
I
leave
three
Engineers
,
all
expert
telegraphist
,
to
tap
the
wire
,
and
they
,
with
the
right
half
company
,
under
Lieutenant
Compton
,
form
a
detached
post
at
this
point
.
<EOS>
I
also
leave
the
cyclist
to
convey
to
me
any
message
which
may
be
receive
on
the
instrument
,
and
then
proceed
to
Newmains
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
now
a
mere
heap
of
smouldering
ruin
;
but
,
as
at
Morningside
,
some
of
the
terrified
villager
have
return
,
and
they
state
that
early
in
the
morning
they
have
see
small
detachment
of
russian
cavalry
pass
through
from
Bankle
,

proceed
north
along

Cleland
road

under
Lieutenant
Planck

order
to
block
the
road

railway
bridge

I
return
to
my
piquet
line

<EOS>
a
few
minute
later
,
however
,
a
cyclist
ride
up
with
a
copy
of
a
message
which
have
be
send
from
the
russian

the
message
be

,
thank
to
the
information
furnish
by
the
spy
who
be
capture
near
Manchester
,
we
be
now
aware
of
some
of
the
code
use
by
the

I
send
the
messenger
on
to
the
Colonel
at
once

<EOS>
one
of

be
able
to
transcribe
it
sufficiently
to
show
that
some
disaster
have
occur
to
the

it
conclude
with
an
order
withdraw

very
severely

we

nevertheless
gain
a
decisive
victory

for
from
dawn
until
the
time

it
be
estimate
that
no

12,000
Russians
have
be
kill

through
Tynehead

when
it

the
enemy

from

the
slaughter

awful

as
noon

find

on

he
report
by

he
have
do

then
our

move

after
half
an

we

off

down

block
the

send
Lieutenant
Planck
over
immediately

a
detachment

several
cyclist

follow
as
soon
as
possible

find
he
have
block
both
road
in
the
centre
of
the
little
Scotch
village

and
have
occupy
the
inn
situate
between
the
two
road

leave
just
sufficient
space
for
his
cyclist
to
pass

look
towards

could
see

desert

the
place
seem
strangely
quiet
after
the
exciting
scene

ceaseless
deafening
din

<EOS>
"
take
six
of
Planck
's
man
and
the
cyclist
about
a
mile
towards
Coatbridge

I
post
them
at
the
cross

road
beyond
Rhind
House

send
the
cyclist
out
along
the
valley
to
Dikehead

<EOS>
all
be
quiet
in
our
immediate
vicinity
for
some
time

until
suddenly
we
discern
the
cyclist
come
back
.
<EOS>
They
report
that
they
have
see
cavalry

<EOS>
this
,
then
,
must
be
a
detachment
of
the
enemy

who
in
all
probability
be
retreat

<EOS>
I
at
once
send
the
cyclist
back
to
inform
Planck
,
and
to
tell
him
we
should
not
take
a
hand
in
the
game
until
we
have
allow
them
to
pass
<EOS>

they
have
discover
his
barricade

in
a
few
minute
we
could
distinctly
hear
them
approach

We
be
all
well
under
cover

I
be
surprised
to
find
that
it
be
only
an
escort
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
gallop
,
and
have
evidently
come
a
long
distance
by
some
circuitous
route
,
and
have
not
take
part
in
the
fighting
.
<EOS>
I
count
five
--
two
Cossacks
in
advance
,
then
about
forty
yard
behind
a
shabbily
-
dressed
civilian
on
horseback
,
and
about
forty
yard
behind
him
two
more
cossack
.
<EOS>
They
appear
to
expect
no
interruption
,
and
it
occur
to
me
that
the
Cossacks
be
escort
the
civilian
over
to
the
russian
position
away
beyond
Hogganfield
Loch
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
clear
,
I
form
my
man
up
on
each
side
of
the
road
to
await
event
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
no
occasion
to
remain
long
in
expectation
,
for
soon
afterwards
the
stillness
be
break
by
shout
and
a
few
rapid
shot
,
and
then
we
could
hear
two
horse
gallop
back
.
<EOS>
one
be
riderless
,
and
a
corporal
who
attempt
to
stop
it
be
knock
down
and
seriously
injure
;
but
the
other
have
a
rider
,
and
as
he
near
us
I
could
see
he
be
the
civilian
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
must
stop
him
at
all
cost
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
,
order
the
man
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
to
lie
down
,
we
give
him
a
section
volley
from
one
side
as
he
rush
past
.
<EOS>
the
horse
be
badly
hit
,
and
stumble
,
throw
its
rider
,
who
be
at
once
secure

<EOS>
to
prevent
him
from
dispose
of
anything
,
we
bind
him
securely
.
<EOS>
two
of
the
Cossacks
have
be
shoot
and
the
other
two
capture
.
<EOS>
upon
the
civilian
,
and
in
his
saddle
-
bag
,
we
find
a
number
of
cipher
despatch
,
elaborate
plan
show
how
Glasgow
be
defend
,
and
an
autograph
letter
from
the
Russian
General
Drukovitch
,
give
him
instruction
to
enter
Glasgow
alone
by
way
of
Partick
,
and
to
await
him
there
until
the
city
fall
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
the
city
be
never
invest

<EOS>
an
hour
after
we
have
send
this
mysterious
civilian
--
who
speak
English
with
a
foreign
accent
--
over
to
the
Colonel
,
our
onslaught
become
doubly
desperate

<EOS>
in
the
dusk

regiment
after
regiment
of
Russians
be
simply
sweep
away
by
the
cool
and
deliberate
fire

British

splendid

back

then
,
as
night
fall
,
a
report
be
spread
that
General
Drukovitch
have
surrender

<EOS>
this
prove
true

<EOS>
with

by
nine
o'clock

cease

during
that
night
nearly

the
slaughter

have
be
frightful

<EOS>
the
struggle
be
indeed
not
for
a
dynasty
,
but
for
the
very
existence
of
Britain
as
an
independent
nation

<EOS>
Sussex
have
be
devastate
,
but
Kent

and
Chatham

of

the
French

take

through
the
hot

in
the
stubborn
resistance
that
would
be
offer
by
the
long
unbroken
line
of
Volunteers

the
range
of
hill
behind

<EOS>
Our
signaller
have
form
a
long

of

from

and
Star

,
south
of
the

however
,
on
several
occasion

although

after

with
that
pluck
characteristic
of
the
true
Briton
,
fortune
nevertheless
seem
to
have
forsake
us
,
and
even
although
we
inflict
frightful
loss
upon
the
French
all
round
,
still
they
gradually
force
back
the
defender
over
the

border

<EOS>
terror
,

death
have
be
spread
by

sack
,

in
Sussex

and
the

trodden
down

<EOS>
the
white
dusty
highway
lead
from
London
to
the
sea
be
pile
with
unheeded
corpse
that
be
fearful
to
gaze
upon
,
yet
Britannia
toil
on
undaunte
in
this
desperate
struggle
for
the
retention
of
her
Empire
.
 
<EOS>
after
our
defeat
at
Horsham
,
the
Russians
have
content
themselves
by
merely
drive
back
the
defender
to
a
line
of
resistance
from
Aldershot
to
the
north
of
Bagshot
,
and
then
they
have
march
onward
to
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
from
Horsham
,
however
,
two
column
of
the
invader
,
mostly
French
,
and
number
over
twenty
thousand
each
,
have
advance
on
Guildford
and
Dorking
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
a
strong
demonstration
be
make
by
the
enemy
in
the
country
north
of
Eastbourne
and
Hailsham
,
by
which
the
whole
of
the
district
in
the
triangle
from
Bexhill
to
Heathfield
,
and
thence
to
Cuckfield
and
Steyning
,
fall
into
their
hand
.
<EOS>
the
British
,
however
,
have
mass
a
strong
force
to
prevent
the
enemy
make
their
way
into
West
Kent
,
and
still
hold
their
own
along
the
hill
stretch
from
Crowborough
to
ticehurst
,
and
from
Etchingham
,
through
Brightling
and
Ashburnham
,
down
to
Battle
and
Hastings
.
 
<EOS>
the
north
of
London
have
during
the
week
of
hostility
be
strongly
guard
by
Volunteers
and
Regulars
,
for
information
of
a
contemplate
landing
in
Essex
have
be
receive
;
and
although
the
defender
have
not
yet
fire
a
shot
,
they
be
eagerly
look
forward
to
a
chance
of
prove
their
worth
,
as
their
comrade
in
other
part
of
England
have
already
do
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
the
tactic
of
the
invader
could
not
be
understand
,
for
it
have
be
conclude
that
they
would
naturally
follow
up
their
success
on
land
with
a
rapid
advance
on
London
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
of
course
,
evident
that
the
vigorous
demonstration
make
in
the
North
and
other
part
of
Britain
be
intend
with
a
view
to
draw
as
many
troop
as
possible
from
the
defence
of
London
,
and
dispose
of
them
in
detail
before
surround
the
capital
.
<EOS>
yet
,
to
the
dismay
of
the
enemy
,
no
blow
they
deliver
in
other
part
of
our
country
have
have
the
desire
effect
of
weaken
the
defensive
line
around
London
.
<EOS>
at
the
opening
of
the
campaign
it
have
be
the
enemy
's
intention
to
reduce
London
by
a
blockade
,
which
could
perhaps
have
be
successfully
carry
out
<EOS>
have
they
land
a
strong
force
in
Essex
.
<EOS>
the
troop
who
be
intend
to
land
there
be
,
however
,
send
to
Scotland
instead
,
and
the
fact
that
they
have
be
annihilate
outside
Glasgow
result
in
a
decision
to
march
at
once
upon
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
advance
from
Horsham
,
the
french
right
column
,
number
20,000
man
with
about
70
gun
,
<EOS>
have
,
after
desperate
fighting
,
at
last
reach
Leatherhead
,
have
leave
a
battalion
in
support
at
Dorking
.
<EOS>
the
British
have
resolutely
contest
every
step
the
French
have
advance
,
and
the
slaughter
around
Dorking
have
be
awful
,
while
the
fighting
across
Fetcham
Downs
and
around
Ockley
and
Bear
Green
have
result
in
frightful
loss
on
both
side
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Regulars
and
Volunteers
,
notwithstanding
their
gallantry
,
be
,
alas
!
<EOS>
gradually
drive
back
by
the
enormous
number
that
have
commence
the
onslaught
,
and
be
at
last
throw
back
westward
in
disorder
,
halt
at
Ripley
.
<EOS>
here
the
survivor
snatch
a
hasty
rest
,
and
they
be
during
the
night
reinforce
by
a
contingent
of
regular
who
have
come
over
from
Windsor
and
Hounslow
.
<EOS>
on
the
arrival
of
these
reinforcement
,
the
Colonel
,
well
know
how
serious
be
the
situation
now
our
first
line
of
defence
have
be
break
,
send
out
a
fly
column
from
Ripley
,
while
the
main
body
march
to
Great
Bookham
,
with
the
result
that
Leatherhead
,
now
in
the
occupation
of
the
French
,
be
from
both
side
vigorously
attack
.
<EOS>
the
british
fly
column
threaten
the
enemy
from
the
north
be
,
however
,
quickly
check
by
the
french
gun
,
and
in
the
transmission
of
an
order
a
most
serious
blunder
occur
,
lead
to
the
impossibility
of
a
retreat
upon
Ripley
,
for
unfortunately
the
order
,
wrongly
give
,
result
in
the
blowing
up
by
mistake
of
the
bridge
over
the
river
Mole
by
which
they
have
cross
,
and
which
they
want
to
use
again
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
be
that
for
a
time
this
force
be
compel
to
remain
,
at
terrible
cost
,
right
under
the
fire
of
the
french
entrenched
position
at
Leatherhead
;
but
the
enemy
be
fortunately
not
strong
enough
to
follow
up
this
advantage
,
and
as
they
occupy
a
strong
strategical
position
they
be
content
to
await
the
arrival
of
their
huge
main
body
,
now
on
the
move
,
and
which
they
expect
would
reach
Leatherhead
during
that
night
.
<EOS>
after
more
fierce
fighting
,
last
one
whole
breathless
day
,
the
defender
be
annihilate
,
while
their
main
body
approach
from
the
south
also
fall
into
a
trap
.
<EOS>
for
several
hour
a
fierce
battle
also
rage
between
Dorking
and
Mickleham
.
<EOS>
the
british
battery
on
Box
Hill
work
awful
havoc
in
the
french
line
,
yet
gradually
the
enemy
silence
our
gun
and
cut
up
our
force
.
 
<EOS>
the
invader
be
now
advance
in
open
order
over
the
whole
of
Sussex
and
the
west
of
Kent
,
and
on
the
same
day
as
the
battle
be
fight
at
Leatherhead
,
the
high
ground
south
of
Sevenoaks
,
extend
from
Wimlet
Hill
to

Common

fall
into
their
hand

british
suffering
severely
;
while
two
of
our
Volunteer
battery
in
the
vicinity
be
surprise
and
seize
by
a
french
fly
column
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
another
french
column
,
number
nearly
twenty
thousand
infantry
and
cavalry
,
have
advance
from
Alfold
,
burn
Ewhurst
and
Cranley
,
and
after
a
desperately
-
contest
engagement
they
capture
the
british
battery

the
hill
at
Hascombe
and

<EOS>
on

on
the

our
brave
civilian
defender

remain
throughout
the
hostility
ready
to
repel
any

indeed
,
as
the
day

and
no
demonstration
have
be
make
in
their
direction
,
they
have
grow
impatient
,
until
at

ferocious
onslaught

,
it

with

new
one

it

up

<EOS>
through
that
brilliant
,
sunny
September
day
the
slaughter
be
terrible
in
every
part
of
the

column

it
be
about
noon
believe
that
they

untenable

<EOS>
nevertheless
,
with
a
dogged
persistency
unusual
to
our
Gallic
neighbour
,
they
continue
to
fight
with
unquelled
vigour
.
<EOS>
the
2nd

the
1st

,
hold
very
important
ground
over
against
Puttenham
,
bore
their
part
with
magnificent
courage
,
but
be
at
length
cut
up
in
a
most
horrible
manner
;
while

who
,
with
a
body
of
Regulars
valiantly
hold
the
road
run
over
the
hill
from

fight
splendidly
;
but
they

,
alas

<EOS>
subsequently
annihilate

<EOS>
over
hill

dale
,
stretch
away
to
the
Sussex
border
,
the
rattle

din
of

<EOS>
the

be
frightful

<EOS>
volunteer
battalion

the

<EOS>
though
these

tradesmen,--yet
our
second
line
of
defence
,
distinct
,
of
course
,
from
the
local
barricade
,
be
a
very
weak
one
.
<EOS>
We
have
rely
upon
our
magnificent
strategic
position
on
the
Surrey

,
and
have
not

these

It

that
before

the
enemy
would
be
outflank
and
attack
in
their
rear
by
a
british

every

<EOS>
the
resistance
which
the

<EOS>
It
be
this
quarrel
which
cause
the

of
London
,
totally
against
the

.
<EOS>
the
bombardment
be
,
in

,
wholly
unnecessary

<EOS>
apparently

<EOS>
the

Their

they

about
a

and
a

just

about
eight
mile

the

be
discover
in

apparently
the

have
combine
,

be
prepare
for
a
final

upon

an
assault

the

<EOS>
He
have
but
three
minute
to

upon

as
he
apparently
elect
to
pierce
the
centre

,
the
British
have
no
time
to
counteract
him
.
<EOS>
the

Our

this
of
course
obscure
from

the
torpedo

under

and
those
on

the
Tsar

pound
away
at
the

unconscious
of
the

of
the
dangerous
little

just
as

that
five
minute

the

almost
at

with
her

<EOS>
the
impact
and
the
angle
at
which
she
be

be
not
,
however
,
sufficient
to
ram
her

consequently
the
two
vessel

entangled
,
and
amid
the
rain
of
bullet
the
Frenchmen
make
a
desperate
attempt
to
board
our

<EOS>
a

but
just
as

there
be
a
dull

then
it

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
a
few
moment
later
,
however
,
it
become
known
throughout
the

the

indeed
,
the
great
armoured
vessel

as
easily
as

,
and
every
moment
hundred
of
poor
fellow

<EOS>
at
last
the
enemy
discover
the
distant
source
of
the
fire
,
and
prepare
to
escape
beyond
range
;
but
in
this
they
be
unsuccessful
,
for
,
after
a
renewed
and
terrific
fight
,
in
which
three
french
ironclad
be
sink
and
two
of
our

be
torpedoed
,
our
force
and
our

<EOS>
the
struggle
have
be
frightful

but
the
victory
be
magnificent

<EOS>
that
same
night
the
british
ship
steam
along
the
Sussex
coast
and
capture
the
whole
of
the
french

transport
,
the

british
vessel
that

<EOS>
the

be
lie
between

and

,
and
by
their
capture
the
enemy
's
mean
of

totally

thus
,
at

eleventh

the

show
itself
worthy

England
regain

CHAPTER

<EOS>
the
day
of
reckoning
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
of
Reckoning
dawn
.
 
<EOS>
on
land
the
battle
be
terrific
;
the
struggle
be
the
most
fierce
and
bloody
of
any
during
the
invasion
.
<EOS>
the
british
Regulars
hold
the
high
ground
along
from
Crowborough
to
ticehurst
,
and
from
Etchingham
,
through
Brightling
and
Ashburnham
,
down
to
Battle
,
advance
in
a
huge
fighting
line
upon
the
enemy
's
base
around
Eastbourne
.
<EOS>
the
onslaught
be
vigorously
repel
,
and
the
battle
across
the
Sussex
Downs
quickly
become
a
most
wild
and
sanguinary
one
;
but
as
the
day
pass
,
although
the
defender
be
numerically
very
weak
,
they
nevertheless
gradually
effect
terrible
slaughter
,
capture
the
whole
of
the
enemy
's
store
,
and
take
nearly
five
thousand
prisoner

<EOS>
in

ammunition

have
be
maintain
at
Sevenoaks
be
be
remove

Bromley

as

british
troop

the

describe
by

Brown
,
of

V.B.
West
Surrey

,
who
be
act
as
one
of
the
special
correspondent
of
the
_

<EOS>
He
wrote--
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
command
of
a
piquet
consisting
of
fifty
man
of
my
regiment
at
Turvan
's
Farm
,
and
about
three
hour
before
the
time
to
destroy
the
remainder
of
the
store
at
Sevenoaks
<EOS>
my
sentry
be
suddenly
drive
in
by
the
enemy
,
who
be
advance
from
the
direction
of
Froghall
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
order
to
hold
the
farm
at
any
cost
,
we
immediately
prepare
for
action
.
<EOS>
fortunately
we
have
a
fair
supply
of
provision
and
plenty
of
ammunition
,
for
since
War
have
break
out
the
place
have
be
utilise
as
a
kind
of
outlying
fort
,
although
at
this
time
only
my
force
occupy
it
.
<EOS>
Our
equipment
include
two
machine
gun
,
and
it
be
mainly
by
the
aid
of
these
we
be
save
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
strength
of
the
attack
force
appear
to
be
about
four
battalion
of
french
infantry
and
a
battalion
of
Zouaves
,
with
two
squadron
of
cuirassier
.
<EOS>
Their
intention
be
,
no
doubt
,
to
cut
the
railway
line
near
Twitton
,
and
thus
prevent
the
removal
of
the
Sevenoaks
store
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
cavalry
scout
come
within
range
we
give
them
a
few
sharp
volley
,
and
those
who
be
able
immediately
retire
in
disorder
.
<EOS>
soon
afterwards
,
however
,
the
farm
be
surround
,
but
I
have
previously
send
information
to
our
reserve
,
and
suggest
that
a
sharp
watch
should
be
keep
upon
the
line
from
Twitton
to
Sevenoaks
,
for
of
course
I
could
do
nothing
with
my
small
force
.
<EOS>
dusk
be
now
creep
on
,
and
as
the
enemy
remain
quiet
for
a
short
time
it
seem
as
though
they
intend
to
assault
our
position
when
it
grow
dark
.
 
<EOS>
"
before
night
set
in
,
however
,
my
messenger
,
who
have
manage
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
enemy
,
return
,
with
a
letter
from
a
brother
officer
state
that
a
great
naval
battle
have
be
fight
in
the
Channel
;
and
further
,
that
the
enemy
's
retreat
have
be
cut
off
,
and
that
the
kentish
defender
have
already
retake
the
invader
'
base
at
Eastbourne
.
<EOS>
if
we
could
,
therefore
,
still
hold
the
Surrey
Hills
,
there
be
yet
a
chance
of
thoroughly
defeat
the
French
and
Russians
,
even
though
one
strong
body
be
report
as
have
take
Guildford
and
Leatherhead
,
and
be
now
march
upon
London
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
evening
draw
on
we
could
hear
heavy
firing
in
the
direction
of
Sevenoaks
,
but
as
we
also
hear
a
train
run
<EOS>
it
become
evident
that
we
still
hold
the
station
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
soon
after
dark
there
be
a
brilliant
flash
<EOS>
which
for
a
second
lit
up
the
country
around
like
day
,
and
a
terrific
report
follow
.
<EOS>
We
know
the
remainder
of
our
store
and
ammunition
have
be
demolish
in
order
that
it
should
not
fall
into
the
enemy
's
hand
!
 
<EOS>
"
shortly
afterwards
we
be
vigorously
attack
,
and
our
position
quickly
become
almost
untenable
by
the
dozen
of
bullet
project
in
every
direction
where
the
flash
of
our
rifle
could
be
see
.
<EOS>
very
soon
some
of
the
farm
outbuilding
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
Frenchmen
,
and
they
set
them
on
fire
,
together
with
a
number
of
haystack
,
in
order
to
burn
us
out
.
<EOS>
this
move
,
however
,
prove
pretty
disastrous
to
them
,
for
the
leaping
flame
quickly
render
it
light
as
day
,
and
show
them
up
,
while
at
the
same
time
flash
from
our
muzzle
be
almost
invisible
to
them
.
<EOS>
thus
we
be
enable
to
bring
our
two
machine
gun
into
action
,
and
break
up
every
party
of
frenchman
who
show
themselves
.
<EOS>
away
over
Sevenoaks
there
be
a
glare
in
the
sky
,
for
the
enemy
be
loot
and
burn
the
town
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
however
,
our
man
who
have
be
defend
the
place
have
retreat
to
Dunton
Green
after
blow
up
the
store
,
and
there
they
re
-
form
and
be
quickly
move
off
in
the
direction
of
Twitton
.
<EOS>
fortunately
they
have
hear
the
commencement
of
the
attack
on
us
,
and
the
commander
,
halt
his
force
,
have
send
out
scout
towards
chevening
,
and
it
appear
they
reach
us
just
at
the
moment
the
enemy
have
fire
the
stack
.
<EOS>
They
work
splendidly
,
and
,
after
go
nearly
all
round
the
enemy
's
position
,
return
and
report
to
their
Colonel
,
who
at
once
resolve
to
relieve
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
may
be
imagine
,
we
be
in
a
most
critical
position
by
this
time
,
especially
as
we
be
unaware
that
assistance
be
so
near
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
order
to
hold
the
farm
,
and
we
mean
to
do
it
as
long
as
breath
remain
in
our
body
.
<EOS>
all
my
man
work
magnificently
,
and
display
remarkable
coolness
,
even
at
the
moment
when
death
stare
us
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
the
report
of
the
scout
enable
their
Colonel
to
make
his
disposition
very
carefully
,
and
it
be
not
long
before
the
enemy
be
almost
completely
surround
.
<EOS>
We
afterwards
learn
that
our
reserve
at
Stockholm
Wood
have
send
out
a
battalion
,
which
fortunately
come
in
touch
with
the
survivor
of
the
Sevenoaks
force
just
as
they
open
a
desperate
onslaught
upon
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
"
with
the
fierce
flame
and
blind
smoke
from
the
burn
stack
belch
in
our
face
,
we
fight
on
with
fire
around
us
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
as
the
fire
draw
near
to
us
<EOS>
the
heat
become
intense
,
the
shower
of
spark
gall
us
almost
as
much
as
the
enemy
's
bullet
,
and
some
of
us
have
our
eyebrow
and
hair
singe
by
the
fierce
flame
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
as
much
as
we
could
do
to
keep
our
ammunition
from
explode
;
nevertheless
we
keep
up
our
stream
of
lead
,
pour
volley
after
volley
upon
those
who
have
attack
us
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
with
such
a
barrier
of
flame
and
obscuring
smoke
between
us
we
could
see
but
little
in
the
darkness
beyond
,
and
we
all
know
that
if
we
emerge
from
cover
we
should
be
pick
off
easily
and
not
a
man
would
survive
.
<EOS>
the
odd
be
against
us
.
<EOS>
More
than
twenty
of
my
brave
fellow
have
fire
their
last
shot
,
and
now
lay
with
their
dead
upturned
face
look
ghastly
in
the
brilliant
glare
,
while
a
number
of
other
have
sink
back
wound
.
<EOS>
the
heat
be
frightful
,
the
smoke
stifle
,
and
I
have
just
give
up
all
hope
of
relief
,
and
have
set
my
tooth
,
determine
to
die
like
an
Englishman
should
,
when
we
hear
a
terrific
volley
of
musketry
at
close
quarter
,
and
immediately
afterward
a
dozen
british
bugle
sound
the
charge
.
<EOS>
the
scene
of
carnage
that
follow
be
terrible
.
<EOS>
Our
comrade
give
one
volley
from
their
magazine
rifle
,
and
then
charge
with
the
bayonet
,
take
the
enemy
completely
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
Frenchmen
try
to
rally
,
but
in
vain
,
and
among
those
huge
burn
barn
and
blaze
rick
they
all
fall
or
be
capture
.
<EOS>
dozen
of
them
struggle
valiantly
till
the
last
;
but
,
refuse
to
surrender
,
they
be
slaughter
amid
a
most
frightful
scene
of
blood
and
fire
.
<EOS>
the
event
of
that
night
be
horrible
,
and
the
true
extent
of
the
loss
on
both
side
be
only
reveal
when
the
flame
die
down
and
the
part
cloud
above
herald
another
grey
and
toilsome
day

"
 
<EOS>
late
on
the
previous
evening
the
advance
guard
of
the
enemy
proceed
north
towards
Caterham
come
in
touch
with
the
defender
north
of
Godstone

<EOS>
the
french
cavalry
have
seize
Red
Hill
Junction
Station
at
sundown
,

some
of

suddenly
come
upon
a
detached
post
of

Volunteers
at
Tyler

close

<EOS>
from
the
report
of
the
inhabitant
and
of
scout
send
out
in
plain
clothe
,
it
be
believe
that
the
French
intend
massing
near
Tandridge
,
and
that
they
would
therefore
wait
for
support
before
attempt
to
break
through
our
outpost
line
,
which
still
remain
intact
from
the

east

have

the

with

inflict
terrible
punishment
upon

but
as
they
emerge
into

preparatory
to

a
volley
into

they

who
kill

close
down

Russians

have
by

the

where
in

one

two
very
sanguinary

these

<EOS>
on

frightful
execution

<EOS>
around
Beare
Green

Trout

at

,
the
enemy
rapidly
bring
their
gun
into
play
,
and
occupy
such
strong
strategic
position
that
as
night
draw
on
it
become
evident
that
they
intend
to
remain
there
until
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
the
defender
have
but
little
cover
,
and
consequently
feel
the
wither
fire
of
the
French
very
severely
.
<EOS>
the
latter
have
entrench
themselves
,
and
now
in
the
darkness
it
be
difficult
for
our

to
discern
their
exact
position
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
situation
of
our
force
become
very
serious
and
unsafe
as
night
proceed
;
but
at
length
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
a
strong
force
of
British
Regulars
,
include
the
Sikhs
and
a
detachment
of
Australians
,
sweep
along
the
road
from
Dorking
,
and
come
suddenly
upon
the
french
patrol
.
<EOS>
these
be
slaughter
with
little
resistance
,
and
almost
before
the
enemy
be
aware
of
it
,
the
whole
position
be
completely
surround
.
 
<EOS>
Our
man
then
use
their
field
search
-
light
with
very
great
advantage
;
for
,
as
the
enemy
be
drive
out
into
the
open
,
they
be
blind
by
the
glare
,
and
fall
an
easy
prey
to
british
rifle
;
while
the
Frenchmen
's
own
machine
gun
be
turn
upon
them
with
frightful
effect
,
their
battalion
be
literally
mow
down
by
the
awful
hail
of
