  
<EOS>
among
the
many
fatality
attend
the
bloom
of
young
desire
,
that
of
blindly
take
to
the
confectionery
line
have
not
,
perhaps
,
be
sufficiently
consider
.
 
<EOS>
how
be
the
son
of
a
british
yeoman
,
who
have
be
feed
principally
on
salt
pork
and
yeast
dumpling
,
to
know
that
there
be
satiety
for
the
human
stomach
even
in
a
paradise
of
glass
jar
full
of
sugared
almond
and
pink
lozenge
,
and
that
the
tedium
of
life
can
reach
a
pitch
where
plum
-
bun
at
discretion
cease
to
offer
the
slight
excitement
?
 
<EOS>
or
how
,
at
the
tender
age
when
a
confectioner
seem
to
him
a
very
prince
whom
all
the
world
must
envy
 
who
breakfast
on
macaroon
,
dine
on
meringue
,
sup
on
twelfth
-
cake
,
and
fill
up
the
intermediate
hour
with
sugar
-
candy
or
peppermint
 
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
foresee
the
day
of
sad
wisdom
,
when
he
will
discern
that
the
confectioner
's
calling
be
not
socially
influential
,
or
favourable
to
a
soar
ambition
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
man
who
turn
out
to
have
a
metaphysical
genius
,
incautiously
,
in
the
period
of
youthful
buoyancy
,
commence
his
career
as
a
dancing
-
master
;
and
you
may
imagine
the
use
that
be
make
of
this
initial
mistake
by
opponent
who
feel
themselves
bind
to
warn
the
public
against
his
doctrine
of
the
Inconceivable
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
give
up
his
dancing
-
lesson
,
because
he
make
his
bread
by
them
,
and
metaphysic
would
not
have
find
him
in
so
much
as
salt
to
his
bread
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
really
the
same
with
Mr.
David
Faux
and
the
confectionery
business
.
 
<EOS>
His
uncle
,
the
butler
at
the
great
house
close
by
Brigford
,
have
make
a
pet
of
him
in
his
early
boyhood
,
and
it
be
on
a
visit
to
this
uncle
that
the
confectioner
'
shop
in
that
brilliant
town
have
,
on
a
single
day
,
fire
his
tender
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
He
carry
home
the
pleasing
illusion
that
a
confectioner
must
be
at
once
the
happy
and
the
foremost
of
man
,
since
the
thing
he
make
be
not
only
the
most
beautiful
to
behold
,
but
the
very
good
eat
,
and
such
as
the
Lord
Mayor
must
always
order
largely
for
his
private
recreation
;
so
that
when
his
father
declare
he
must
be
put
to
a
trade
,
David
choose
his
line
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
;
and
,
with
a
rashness
inspire
by
a
sweet
tooth
,
wed
himself
irrevocably
to
confectionery
.
 
<EOS>
soon
,
however
,
the
tooth
lose
its
relish
and
fall
into
blank
indifference
;
and
all
the
while
,
his
mind
expand
,
his
ambition
take
new
shape
,
which
could
hardly
be
satisfied
within
the
sphere
his
youthful
ardour
have
choose
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
he
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
man
of
much
mental
activity
,
and
,
above
all
,
gift
with
a
spirit
of
contrivance
;
but
then
,
his
faculty
would
not
tell
with
great
effect
in
any
other
medium
than
that
of
candy
sugar
,
conserve
,
and
pastry
.
 
<EOS>
say
what
you
will
about
the
identity
of
the
reasoning
process
in
all
branch
of
thought
,
or
about
the
advantage
of
come
to
subject
with
a
fresh
mind
,
the
adjustment
of
butter
to
flour
,
and
of
heat
to
pastry
,
be
not
the
good
preparation
for
the
office
of
prime
minister
;
besides
,
in
the
present
imperfectly
-
organize
state
of
society
,
there
be
social
barrier
.
 
<EOS>
David
could
invent
delightful
thing
in
the
way
of
drop
-
cake
,
and
he
have
the
wide
view
of
the
sugar
department
;
but
in
other
direction
he
certainly
feel
hamper
by
the
want
of
knowledge
and
practical
skill
;
and
the
world
be
so
inconveniently
constitute
,
that
the
vague
consciousness
of
be
a
fine
fellow
be
no
guarantee
of
success
in
any
line
of
business
.
  
<EOS>
this
difficulty
press
with
some
severity
on
Mr.
David
Faux
,
even
before
his
apprenticeship
be
end
.
 
<EOS>
His
soul
swell
with
an
impatient
sense
that
he
ought
to
become
something
very
remarkable
 
that
it
be
quite
out
of
the
question
for
him
to
put
up
with
a
narrow
lot
as
other
man
do
:
he
scorn
the
idea
that
he
could
accept
an
average
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sure
there
be
nothing
average
about
him
:
even
such
a
person
as
Mrs.
Tibbits
,
the
washer
-
woman
,
perceive
it
,
and
probably
have
a
preference
for
his
linen
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
particular
period
he
be
weigh
out
gingerbread
nut
;
but
such
an
anomaly
could
not
continue
.
 
<EOS>
no
position
could
be
suit
to
Mr.
David
Faux
that
be
not
in
the
high
degree
easy
to
the
flesh
and
flattering
to
the
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
fall
on
the
present
time
,
and
enjoy
the
advantage
of
a
Mechanic
's
institute
,
he
would
certainly
have
take
to
literature
and
have
write
review
;
but
his
education
have
not
be
liberal
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
read
some
novel
from
the
adjoining
circulating
library
,
and
have
even
buy
the
story
of
Inkle
and
Yarico
,
which
have
make
him
feel
very
sorry
for
poor
Mr.
Inkle
;
so
that
his
idea
may
not
have
be
below
a
certain
mark
of
the
literary
calling
;
but
his
spelling
and
diction
be
too
unconventional
.
  
<EOS>
when
a
man
be
not
adequately
appreciate
or
comfortably
place
in
his
own
country
,
his
thought
naturally
turn
towards
foreign
clime
;
and
David
's
imagination
circle
round
and
round
the
utmost
limit
of
his
geographical
knowledge
,
in
search
of
a
country
where
a
young
gentleman
of
pasty
visage
,
lipless
mouth
,
and
stumpy
hair
,
would
be
likely
to
be
receive
with
the
hospitable
enthusiasm
which
he
have
a
right
to
expect
.
 
<EOS>
have
a
general
idea
of
America
as
a
country
where
the
population
be
chiefly
black
,
it
appear
to
him
the
most
propitious
destination
for
an
emigrant
who
,
to
begin
with
,
have
the
broad
and
easily
recognizable
merit
of
whiteness
;
and
this
idea
gradually
take
such
strong
possession
of
him
that
Satan
seize
the
opportunity
of
suggest
to
him
that
he
may
emigrate
under
easy
circumstance
,
if
he
supply
himself
with
a
little
money
from
his
master
's
till
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
evil
spirit
,
whose
understanding
,
I
be
convince
,
have
be
much
overrate
,
quite
waste
his
time
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
David
would
certainly
have
like
well
to
have
some
of
his
master
's
money
in
his
pocket
,
if
he
have
be
sure
his
master
would
have
be
the
only
man
to
suffer
for
it
;
but
he
be
a
cautious
youth
,
and
quite
determined
to
run
no
risk
on
his
own
account
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
stay
out
his
apprenticeship
,
and
commit
no
act
of
dishonesty
that
be
at
all
likely
to
be
discover
,
reserve
his
plan
of
emigration
for
a
future
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
circumstance
under
which
he
carry
it
out
be
in
this
wise
.
 
<EOS>
have
be
at
home
a
week
or
two
partaking
of
the
family
bean
,
he
have
use
his
leisure
in
ascertain
a
fact
which
be
of
considerable
importance
to
him
,
namely
,
that
his
mother
have
a
small
sum
in
guinea
painfully
save
from
her
maiden
perquisite
,
and
keep
in
the
corner
of
a
drawer
where
her
baby
-
linen
have
repose
for
the
last
twenty
year
 
ever
since
her
son
David
have
take
to
his
foot
,
with
a
slight
promise
of
bow
-
leg
which
have
not
be
altogether
unfulfille
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Faux
,
senior
,
have
tell
his
son
very
frankly
,
that
he
must
not
look
to
be
set
up
in
business
by
him
:
with
seven
son
,
and
one
of
them
a
very
healthy
and
well
-
develop
idiot
,
who
consume
a
dumpling
about
eight
inch
in
diameter
every
day
,
it
be
pretty
well
if
they
get
a
hundred
apiece
at
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
what
be
David
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
hard
that
he
should
take
his
mother
's
money
;
but
he
see
no
other
ready
mean
of
get
any
,
and
it
be
not
to
be
expect
that
a
young
man
of
his
merit
should
put
up
with
inconvenience
that
could
be
avoid
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
not
robbery
to
take
property
belong
to
your
mother
:
she
do
not
prosecute
you
.
 
<EOS>
and
David
be
very
well
behave
to
his
mother
;
he
comfort
her
by
speak
highly
of
himself
to
her
,
and
assure
her
that
he
never
fall
into
the
vice
he
see
practise
by
other
youth
of
his
own
age
,
and
that
he
be
particularly
fond
of
honesty
.
 
<EOS>
if
his
mother
would
have
give
him
her
twenty
guinea
as
a
reward
of
this
noble
disposition
,
he
really
would
not
have
steal
them
from
her
,
and
it
would
have
be
more
agreeable
to
his
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
to
an
active
mind
like
David
's
,
ingenuity
be
not
without
its
pleasure
:
it
be
rather
an
interesting
occupation
to
become
stealthily
acquaint
with
the
ward
of
his
mother
's
simple
key
(
not
in
the
least
like
Chubb
's
patent
)
,
and
to
get
one
that
would
do
its
work
equally
well
;
and
also
to
arrange
a
little
drama
by
which
he
would
escape
suspicion
,
and
run
no
risk
of
forfeit
the
prospective
hundred
at
his
father
's
death
,
which
would
be
convenient
in
the
improbable
case
of
his
not
make
a
large
fortune
in
the
"
Indies
.
"
  
<EOS>
first
,
he
speak
freely
of
his
intention
to
start
shortly
for
Liverpool
and
take
ship
for
America
;
a
resolution
which
cost
his
good
mother
some
pain
,
for
,
after
Jacob
the
idiot
,
there
be
not
one
of
her
son
to
whom
her
heart
cling
more
than
to
her
youngest
-
bear
,
David
.
 
<EOS>
next
,
it
appear
to
him
that
Sunday
afternoon
,
when
everybody
be
go
to
church
except
Jacob
and
the
cowboy
,
be
so
singularly
favourable
an
opportunity
for
son
who
want
to
appropriate
their
mother
'
guinea
,
that
he
half
think
it
must
have
be
kindly
intend
by
Providence
for
such
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
especially
the
third
Sunday
in
Lent
;
because
Jacob
have
be
out
on
one
of
his
occasional
wandering
for
the
last
two
day
;
and
David
,
be
a
timid
young
man
,
have
a
considerable
dread
and
hatred
of
Jacob
,
as
of
a
large
personage
who
go
about
habitually
with
a
pitchfork
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
easy
,
then
,
than
for
David
on
this
Sunday
afternoon
to
decline
go
to
church
,
on
the
ground
that
he
be
go
to
tea
at
Mr.
Lunn
's
,
whose
pretty
daughter
Sally
have
be
an
early
flame
of
his
,
and
,
when
the
church
-
goer
be
at
a
safe
distance
,
to
abstract
the
guinea
from
their
wooden
box
and
slip
them
into
a
small
canvas
bag
 
nothing
easy
than
to
call
to
the
cowboy
that
he
be
go
,
and
tell
him
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
house
for
fear
of
Sunday
tramp
.
 
<EOS>
David
think
it
would
be
easy
,
too
,
to
get
to
a
small
thicket
and
bury
his
bag
in
a
hole
he
have
already
make
and
cover
up
under
the
root
of
an
old
hollow
ash
,
and
he
have
,
in
fact
,
find
the
hole
without
a
moment
's
difficulty
,
have
uncover
it
,
and
be
about
gently
to
drop
the
bag
into
it
,
<EOS>
when
the
sound
of
a
large
body
rustle
towards
him
with
something
like
a
bellow
be
such
a
surprise
to
David
,
who
,
as
a
gentleman
gift
with
much
contrivance
,
be
naturally
only
prepare
for
what
he
expect
,
that
instead
of
drop
the
bag
gently
he
let
it
fall
so
as
to
make
it
untwist
and
vomit
forth
the
shine
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
same
moment
he
look
up
and
see
his
dear
brother
Jacob
close
upon
him
,
hold
the
pitchfork
so
that
the
bright
smooth
prong
be
a
yard
in
advance
of
his
own
body
,
and
about
a
foot
off
David
's
.
 
<EOS>
(
a
learned
friend
,
to
whom
I
once
narrate
this
history
,
observe
that
it
be
David
's
guilt
which
make
these
prong
formidable
,
and
that
the
"
men
nil
conscia
sibi
"
strip
a
pitchfork
of
all
terror
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
this
idea
so
valuable
,
that
I
obtain
his
leave
to
use
it
on
condition
of
suppress
his
name
.
)
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
David
do
not
entirely
lose
his
presence
of
mind
;
for
in
that
case
he
would
have
sink
on
the
earth
or
start
backward
;
whereas
he
keep
his
ground
and
smile
at
Jacob
,
who
nod
his
head
up
and
down
,
and
say
,
"
Hoich
,
Zavy
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
a
painfully
equivocal
manner
.
 
<EOS>
David
's
heart
be
beat
audibly
,
and
if
he
have
have
any
lip
they
would
have
be
pale
;
but
his
mental
activity
,
instead
of
be
paralysed
,
be
stimulate
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
inwardly
pray
(
he
always
pray
when
he
be
much
frightened
)
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
save
me
this
once
,
and
I
will
never
get
into
danger
again
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
he
be
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
in
search
of
a
box
of
yellow
lozenge
,
which
he
have
bring
with
him
from
Brigford
among
other
delicacy
of
the
same
portable
kind
,
as
a
means
of
conciliating
proud
beauty
,
and
more
particularly
the
beauty
of
Miss
Sarah
Lunn
.
 
<EOS>
not
one
of
these
delicacy
have
he
ever
offer
to
poor
Jacob
,
for
David
be
not
a
young
man
to
waste
his
jujube
and
barley
-
sugar
in
give
pleasure
to
people
from
whom
he
expect
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
but
an
idiot
with
equivocal
intention
and
<EOS>
a
pitchfork
be
as
well
worth
flattering
and
cajole
as
if
he
be
Louis
Napoleon
.
 
<EOS>
so
David
,
with
a
promptitude
equal
to
the
occasion
,
draw
out
his
box
of
yellow
lozenge
,
lift
the
lid
,
and
perform
a
pantomime
with
his
mouth
and
finger
,
which
be
mean
to
imply
that
he
be
delighted
to
see
his
dear
brother
Jacob
,
and
seize
the
opportunity
of
make
him
a
small
present
,
which
he
would
find
particularly
agreeable
to
the
taste
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
,
you
understand
,
be
not
an
intense
idiot
,
but
within
a
certain
limited
range
know
how
to
choose
the
good
and
reject
the
evil
:
he
take
one
lozenge
,
by
way
of
test
,
and
suck
it
as
if
he
have
be
a
philosopher
;
then
,
in
as
great
an
ecstacy
at
its
new
and
complex
savour
as
Caliban
at
the
taste
of
Trinculo
's
wine
,
chuckle
and
stroke
this
suddenly
beneficent
brother
,
and
hold
out
his
hand
for
more
;
for
,
except
in
fit
of
anger
,
<EOS>
Jacob
be
not
ferocious
or
needlessly
predatory
.
 
<EOS>
David
's
courage
half
return
,
and
he
leave
off
pray
;
pour
a
dozen
lozenge
into
Jacob
's
palm
,
and
try
to
look
very
fond
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
congratulate
himself
that
he
have
form
the
plan
of
go
to
see
Miss
Sally
Lunn
this
afternoon
,
and
that
,
as
a
consequence
,
he
have
bring
with
him
these
propitiatory
delicacy
:
he
be
certainly
a
lucky
fellow
;
indeed
,
it
be
always
likely
Providence
should
be
fonder
of
him
than
of
other
apprentice
,
and
since
he
be
to
be
interrupt
,
why
,
an
idiot
be
preferable
to
any
other
sort
of
witness
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
David
think
he
see
the
advantage
of
idiot
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Jacob
,
he
have
thrust
his
pitchfork
into
the
ground
,
and
have
throw
himself
down
beside
it
,
in
thorough
abandonment
to
the
unprecedented
pleasure
of
have
five
lozenge
in
his
mouth
at
once
,
blink
meanwhile
,
and
make
inarticulate
sound
of
gustative
content
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
yet
give
any
sign
of
notice
the
guinea
,
but
in
seat
himself
he
have
lay
his
broad
right
hand
on
them
,
and
unconsciously
keep
it
in
that
position
,
absorb
in
the
sensation
of
his
palate
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
could
only
be
keep
so
occupy
with
the
lozenge
as
not
to
see
the
guinea
before
David
could
manage
to
cover
them
!
 
<EOS>
that
be
David
's
good
hope
of
safety
;
for
Jacob
know
his
mother
's
guinea
;
it
have
be
part
of
their
common
experience
as
boy
to
be
allow
to
look
at
these
handsome
coin
,
and
rattle
them
in
their
box
on
high
day
and
holiday
,
and
among
all
Jacob
's
narrow
experience
as
to
money
,
this
be
likely
to
be
the
most
memorable
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
Jacob
,
"
say
David
,
in
an
insinuating
tone
,
hand
the
box
to
him
,
"
I
will
give
'em
all
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Run
!
 
<EOS>
make
haste
!
 
<EOS>
else
somebody'll
come
and
take
'
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
David
,
not
have
study
the
psychology
of
idiot
,
be
not
aware
that
they
be
not
to
be
work
upon
by
imaginative
fear
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
take
the
box
with
his
left
hand
,
but
see
no
necessity
for
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
be
ever
a
promising
young
man
wish
to
lay
the
foundation
of
his
fortune
by
appropriate
his
mother
's
guinea
obstruct
by
such
a
day
-
mare
as
this
?
<EOS>
but
the
moment
must
come
when
Jacob
would
move
his
right
hand
to
draw
off
the
lid
of
the
tin
box
,
and
then
David
would
sweep
the
guinea
into
the
hole
with
the
utmost
address
and
swiftness
,
and
immediately
seat
himself
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
ah
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
to
have
foresight
when
you
be
deal
with
an
idiot
:
he
be
not
to
be
calculate
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
's
right
hand
be
give
to
vague
clutching
and
throw
;
it
suddenly
clutch
the
guinea
as
if
they
have
be
so
many
pebble
,
and
be
raise
in
an
attitude
which
promise
to
scatter
them
like
seed
over
a
distant
bramble
,
when
,
from
some
prompting
or
other
 
probably
of
an
unwonted
sensation
 
it
pause
,
descend
to
Jacob
's
knee
,
and
open
slowly
under
the
inspection
of
Jacob
's
dull
eye
.
 
<EOS>
David
begin
to
pray
again
,
but
immediately
desist
 
another
resource
have
occur
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
mother
!
<EOS>
zinnie
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
the
innocent
Jacob
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
look
at
David
,
he
say
,
interrogatively
,
"
Box
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
hush
!
"
say
David
,
summon
all
his
ingenuity
in
this
severe
strait
.
 
<EOS>
"
see
,
Jacob
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
take
the
tin
box
from
his
brother
's
hand
,
and
empty
it
of
the
lozenge
,
return
half
of
them
to
Jacob
,
but
secretly
keep
the
rest
in
his
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
hold
out
the
empty
box
,
and
say
,
"
here
be
the
box
,
Jacob
!
 
<EOS>
the
box
for
the
guinea
!
<EOS>
"
gently
sweep
them
from
Jacob
's
palm
into
the
box
.
  
<EOS>
this
procedure
be
not
objectionable
to
Jacob
;
on
the
contrary
,
the
guinea
clink
so
pleasantly
as
they
fall
,
that
he
wish
for
a
repetition
of
the
sound
,
and
seize
the
box
,
begin
to
rattle
it
very
gleefully
.
 
<EOS>
David
,
seize
the
opportunity
,
deposit
his
reserve
of
lozenge
in
the
ground
and
hastily
sweep
some
earth
over
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
,
Jacob
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
pause
from
his
clinking
,
and
look
into
the
hole
,
while
David
begin
to
scratch
away
the
earth
,
as
if
in
doubtful
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
lozenge
be
lay
bare
,
he
take
them
out
one
by
one
,
and
give
them
to
Jacob
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
in
a
loud
whisper
,
"
tell
nobody
 
all
for
Jacob
 
hush
 
sh
 
sh
!
 
<EOS>
Put
guinea
in
the
hole
 
<EOS>
they
will
come
out
like
this
!
"
 
<EOS>
to
make
the
lesson
more
complete
,
he
take
a
guinea
,
and
lower
it
into
the
hole
,
say
,
"
put
in
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
he
take
the
last
lozenge
out
,
he
say
,
"
come
out
so
,
"
and
put
the
lozenge
into
Jacob
's
hospitable
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
Jacob
turn
his
head
on
one
side
,
look
first
at
his
brother
and
then
at
the
hole
,
like
a
reflective
monkey
,
and
,
finally
,
lay
the
box
of
guinea
in
the
hole
with
much
decision
.
 
<EOS>
David
make
haste
to
add
every
one
of
the
stray
coin
,
put
on
the
lid
,
and
cover
it
well
with
earth
,
say
in
his
meet
coax
tone
   
<EOS>
"
take
"
m
out
to
-
morrow
,
Jacob
;
all
for
Jacob
!
 
<EOS>
Hush
 
<EOS>
sh
 
sh
!
"
  
<EOS>
Jacob
,
to
whom
this
once
indifferent
brother
have
all
at
once
become
a
sort
of
sweet
-
tasted
fetish
,
stroke
David
's
good
coat
with
his
adhesive
finger
,
and
then
hug
him
with
an
accompaniment
of
that
mingle
chuckling
and
gurgling
by
which
he
be
accustom
to
express
the
milder
passion
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
he
have
choose
to
bite
a
small
morsel
out
of
his
beneficent
brother
's
cheek
,
David
would
have
be
oblige
to
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
must
pause
,
to
point
out
to
you
the
short
-
sightedness
of
human
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
this
ingenious
young
man
,
Mr.
David
Faux
,
think
he
have
achieve
a
triumph
of
cunne
when
he
have
associate
himself
in
his
brother
's
rudimentary
mind
with
the
flavour
of
yellow
lozenge
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
yet
to
learn
that
it
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
make
an
idiot
fond
of
you
,
when
you
yourself
be
not
of
an
affectionate
disposition
:
especially
an
idiot
with
a
pitchfork
 
obviously
a
difficult
friend
to
shake
off
by
rough
usage
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
seem
to
you
rather
a
blunder
contrivance
for
a
clever
young
man
to
bury
the
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
everything
have
turn
out
as
David
have
calculate
,
you
would
have
see
that
his
plan
be
worthy
of
his
talent
.
<EOS>
the
guinea
would
have
lain
safely
in
the
earth
while
the
theft
be
discover
,
and
David
,
with
the
calm
of
conscious
innocence
,
would
have
linger
at
home
,
reluctant
to
say
good
-
bye
to
his
dear
mother
while
she
be
in
grief
about
her
guinea
;
till
at
length
,
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
,
he
would
have
disinter
them
in
the
strict
privacy
,
and
carry
them
on
his
own
person
without
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
but
David
,
you
perceive
,
have
reckon
without
his
host
,
or
,
to
speak
more
precisely
,
without
his
idiot
brother
 
an
item
of
so
uncertain
and
fluctuate
a
character
,
that
I
doubt
whether
he
would
not
have
puzzle
the
astute
hero
of
M.
de
Balzac
,
whose
foresight
be
so
remarkably
at
home
in
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
clear
to
David
now
that
he
have
only
one
alternative
before
him
:
he
must
either
renounce
the
guinea
,
by
quietly
put
them
back
in
his
mother
's
drawer
(
a
course
not
unattende
with
difficulty
)
;
or
he
must
leave
more
than
a
suspicion
behind
him
,
by
depart
early
the
next
morning
without
give
notice
,
and
with
the
guinea
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
for
if
he
give
notice
that
he
be
go
,
his
mother
,
he
know
,
would
insist
on
fetch
from
her
box
of
guinea
<EOS>
the
three
she
have
always
promise
him
as
his
share
;
indeed
,
in
his
original
plan
,
he
have
count
on
this
as
a
means
by
which
the
theft
would
be
discover
under
circumstance
that
would
themselves
speak
for
his
innocence
;
but
now
,
as
I
need
hardly
explain
,
that
well
-
combine
plan
be
completely
frustrated
.
 
<EOS>
even
if
David
could
have
bribe
Jacob
with
perpetual
lozenge
,
an
idiot
's
secrecy
be
itself
betrayal
.
 
<EOS>
He
dare
not
even
go
to
tea
at
Mr.
Lunn
's
,
for
in
that
case
he
would
have
lose
sight
of
Jacob
,
who
,
in
his
impatience
for
the
crop
of
lozenge
,
may
scratch
up
the
box
again
while
he
be
absent
,
and
carry
it
home
 
deprive
him
at
once
of
reputation
and
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
he
must
think
of
nothing
all
the
rest
of
this
day
,
but
of
coax
Jacob
and
keep
him
out
of
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
fatiguing
and
anxious
evening
to
David
;
nevertheless
,
he
dare
not
go
to
sleep
without
tie
a
piece
of
string
to
his
thumb
and
great
toe
,
to
secure
his
frequent
waking
;
for
he
mean
to
be
up
with
the
first
peep
of
dawn
,
and
be
far
out
of
reach
before
breakfast
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
,
he
think
,
would
certainly
cut
him
off
with
a
shilling
;
but
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
such
a
striking
young
man
as
he
would
be
sure
to
be
well
receive
in
the
West
Indies
<EOS>
:
in
foreign
country
there
be
always
opening
 
even
for
cat
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
probable
that
some
Princess
Yarico
would
want
him
to
marry
her
,
and
make
him
present
of
very
large
jewel
beforehand
;
after
which
,
he
nee
not
marry
her
unless
he
like
.
 
<EOS>
David
have
make
up
his
mind
not
to
steal
any
more
,
even
from
people
who
be
fond
of
him
:
it
be
an
unpleasant
way
of
make
your
fortune
in
a
world
where
you
be
likely
to
surprised
in
the
act
by
brother
.
 
<EOS>
such
alarm
do
not
agree
with
David
's
constitution
,
and
he
have
feel
so
much
nausea
this
evening
that
no
doubt
his
liver
be
affect
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
he
would
have
be
greatly
hurt
not
to
be
think
well
of
in
the
world
:
he
always
mean
to
make
a
figure
,
and
be
think
worthy
of
the
good
seat
and
the
good
morsel
.
  
<EOS>
ruminate
to
this
effect
on
the
brilliant
future
in
reserve
for
him
,
David
by
the
help
of
his
check
-
string
keep
himself
on
the
alert
to
seize
the
time
of
early
dawn
for
his
rising
and
departure
.
 
<EOS>
His
brother
,
of
course
,
be
early
riser
,
but
he
should
anticipate
them
by
at
least
an
hour
and
a
half
,
and
the
little
room
which
he
have
to
himself
as
only
an
occasional
visitor
,
have
its
window
over
the
horse
-
block
,
so
that
he
could
slip
out
through
the
window
without
the
least
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
,
the
horrible
Jacob
,
have
an
awkward
trick
of
get
up
before
everybody
else
,
to
stem
his
hunger
by
empty
the
milk
-
bowl
that
be
"
duly
set
"
for
him
;
but
of
late
he
have
take
to
sleep
in
the
hay
-
loft
,
and
if
he
come
into
the
house
,
it
would
be
on
the
opposite
side
to
that
from
which
David
be
make
his
exit
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
to
think
of
Jacob
;
yet
David
be
liberal
enough
to
bestow
a
curse
on
him
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
only
thing
he
ever
do
bestow
gratuitously
.
 
<EOS>
His
small
bundle
of
clothe
be
ready
pack
,
and
he
be
soon
tread
lightly
on
the
step
of
the
horse
-
block
,
soon
walk
at
a
smart
pace
across
the
field
towards
the
thicket
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
take
him
no
more
than
two
minute
to
get
out
the
box
;
he
could
make
out
the
tree
it
be
under
by
the
pale
strip
where
the
bark
be
off
,
although
the
dawn
light
be
rather
dimmer
in
the
thicket
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
,
in
the
name
of
 
burn
pastry
 
be
that
large
body
with
a
staff
plant
beside
it
,
close
at
the
foot
of
the
ash
-
tree
?
 
<EOS>
David
pause
,
not
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
the
nature
of
the
apparition
 
<EOS>
he
have
not
the
happiness
of
doubt
for
a
moment
that
the
staff
be
Jacob
's
pitchfork
 
but
to
gather
the
self
-
command
necessary
for
address
his
brother
with
a
sufficiently
honey
accent
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
be
absorb
in
scratch
up
the
earth
,
and
have
not
hear
David
's
approach
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Jacob
,
"
say
David
in
a
loud
whisper
,
just
as
the
tin
box
be
lift
out
of
the
hole
.
  
<EOS>
Jacob
look
up
,
and
discern
his
sweet
-
flavoured
brother
,
nod
and
grin
in
the
dim
light
in
a
way
that
make
him
seem
to
David
like
a
triumphant
demon
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
of
an
impetuous
disposition
,
he
would
have
snatch
the
pitchfork
from
the
ground
and
impale
this
fraternal
demon
.
 
<EOS>
but
David
be
by
no
means
impetuous
;
he
be
a
young
man
greatly
give
to
calculate
consequence
,
a
habit
which
have
be
hold
to
be
the
foundation
of
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
but
somehow
it
have
not
precisely
that
effect
in
David
:
he
calculate
whether
an
action
would
harm
himself
,
or
whether
it
would
only
harm
other
people
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
former
case
he
be
very
timid
about
satisfy
his
immediate
desire
,
but
in
the
latter
he
would
risk
the
result
with
much
courage
.
  
<EOS>
"
give
it
me
,
Jacob
,
"
he
say
,
stoop
down
and
pat
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
us
see
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jacob
,
find
the
lid
rather
tight
,
give
the
box
to
his
brother
in
perfect
faith
.
 
<EOS>
David
raise
the
lid
and
shake
his
head
,
while
Jacob
put
his
finger
in
and
take
out
a
guinea
to
taste
whether
the
metamorphosis
into
lozenge
be
complete
and
satisfactory
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Jacob
;
too
soon
,
too
soon
,
"
say
David
,
when
the
guinea
have
be
taste
.
 
<EOS>
"
give
it
me
;
we
will
go
and
bury
it
somewhere
else
;
we
will
put
it
in
yonder
,
"
he
add
,
point
vaguely
toward
the
distance
.
  
<EOS>
David
screw
on
the
lid
,
while
Jacob
,
look
grave
,
rise
and
grasp
his
pitchfork
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
see
David
's
bundle
,
he
snatch
it
,
like
a
too
officious
Newfoundland
,
stick
his
pitchfork
into
it
and
carry
it
over
his
shoulder
in
triumph
as
he
accompany
David
and
the
box
out
of
the
thicket
.
  
<EOS>
what
on
earth
be
David
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
easy
to
frown
at
Jacob
,
and
kick
him
,
and
order
him
to
get
away
;
but
David
dare
as
soon
have
kick
the
bull
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
be
quiet
as
long
as
he
be
treat
indulgently
;
but
on
the
slight
show
of
anger
,
he
become
unmanageable
,
and
be
liable
to
fit
of
fury
which
would
have
make
him
formidable
even
without
his
pitchfork
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
mastery
to
be
obtain
over
him
except
by
kindness
or
guile
.
 
<EOS>
David
try
guile
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
,
Jacob
,
"
he
say
,
when
they
be
out
of
the
thicket
 
point
towards
the
house
as
he
speak
;
"
go
and
fetch
me
a
spade
 
a
spade
.
 
<EOS>
but
give
me
the
bundle
,
"
he
add
,
try
to
reach
it
from
the
fork
,
where
it
hang
high
above
Jacob
's
tall
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
but
Jacob
show
as
much
alacrity
in
obey
as
a
wasp
show
in
leave
a
sugar
-
basin
.
 
<EOS>
Near
David
,
he
feel
himself
in
the
vicinity
of
lozenge
:
he
chuckle
and
rub
his
brother
's
back
,
brandish
the
bundle
higher
out
of
reach
.
 
<EOS>
David
,
with
an
inward
groan
,
change
his
tactic
,
and
walk
on
as
fast
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
safe
to
linger
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
would
get
tired
of
follow
him
,
or
,
at
all
event
,
could
be
elude
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
could
once
get
to
the
distant
highroad
,
a
coach
would
overtake
them
,
David
would
mount
it
,
have
previously
by
some
ingenious
mean
secure
his
bundle
,
and
then
Jacob
may
howl
and
flourish
his
pitchfork
as
much
as
he
like
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
he
be
under
the
fatal
necessity
of
be
very
kind
to
this
ogre
,
and
of
provide
a
large
breakfast
for
him
when
they
stop
at
a
roadside
inn
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
already
three
hour
since
they
have
start
,
and
David
be
tired
.
 
<EOS>
Would
no
coach
be
come
up
soon
?
<EOS>
he
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
no
coach
for
the
next
two
hour
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
carrier
's
cart
to
come
immediately
,
on
its
way
to
the
next
town
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
could
slip
out
,
even
leave
his
bundle
behind
,
and
get
into
the
cart
without
Jacob
!
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
new
obstacle
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
have
recently
discover
a
remnant
of
sugar
-
candy
in
one
of
his
brother
's
tail
-
pocket
;
and
,
since
then
,
have
cautiously
keep
his
hold
on
that
limb
of
the
garment
,
perhaps
with
an
expectation
that
there
would
be
a
further
development
of
sugar
-
candy
after
a
long
or
short
interval
.
 
<EOS>
now
every
one
who
have
wear
a
coat
will
understand
the
sensibility
that
must
keep
a
man
from
start
away
in
a
hurry
when
there
be
a
grasp
on
his
coat
-
tail
.
 
<EOS>
David
look
forward
to
be
well
receive
among
stranger
,
but
it
may
make
a
difference
if
he
have
only
one
tail
to
his
coat
.
  
<EOS>
He
feel
himself
in
a
cold
perspiration
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
walk
no
more
:
he
must
get
into
the
cart
and
let
Jacob
get
in
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
presently
a
cheer
idea
occur
to
him
:
after
so
large
a
breakfast
,
Jacob
would
be
sure
to
go
to
sleep
in
the
cart
;
you
see
at
once
that
David
mean
to
seize
his
bundle
,
jump
out
,
and
be
free
.
 
<EOS>
His
expectation
be
partly
fulfil
:
Jacob
do
go
to
sleep
in
the
cart
,
but
it
be
in
a
peculiar
attitude
 
<EOS>
it
be
with
his
arm
tightly
fasten
round
his
dear
brother
's
body
;
<EOS>
and
if
ever
David
attempt
to
move
,
the
grasp
tighten
with
the
force
of
an
affectionate
boa
-
constrictor
.
  
<EOS>
"
th
'
innicent
be
fond
on
you
,
"
observe
the
carrier
,
think
that
David
be
probably
an
amiable
brother
,
and
wish
to
pay
him
a
compliment
.
  
<EOS>
David
groan
.
 
<EOS>
the
way
of
thieving
be
not
way
of
pleasantness
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
why
have
he
an
idiot
brother
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
why
,
in
general
,
be
the
world
so
constitute
that
a
man
could
not
take
his
mother
's
guinea
comfortably
?
<EOS>
David
become
grimly
speculative
.
  
<EOS>
copious
dinner
at
noon
for
Jacob
;
but
little
dinner
,
because
little
appetite
,
for
David
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
eat
,
he
ply
Jacob
with
beer
;
for
through
this
liberality
he
descry
a
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
fall
into
a
dead
sleep
,
at
last
,
without
have
his
arm
round
David
,
who
pay
the
reckoning
,
take
his
bundle
,
and
walk
off
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
half
-
hour
he
be
on
the
coach
on
his
way
to
Liverpool
,
smile
the
smile
of
the
triumphant
wicked
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
rid
of
Jacob
 
<EOS>
he
be
bind
for
the
Indies
,
where
a
gullible
princess
await
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
never
steal
any
more
,
but
there
would
be
no
need
;
he
would
show
himself
so
deserve
,
that
people
would
make
him
present
freely
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
give
up
the
notion
of
his
father
's
legacy
;
but
it
be
not
likely
he
would
ever
want
that
trifle
;
and
even
if
he
do
 
why
,
it
be
a
compensation
to
think
that
in
be
for
ever
divide
from
his
family
he
be
divide
from
Jacob
,
more
terrible
than
Gorgon
or
Demogorgon
to
David
's
timid
green
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
heaven
,
he
should
never
see
Jacob
any
more
!
    
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
six
year
after
the
departure
of
Mr.
David
Faux
for
the
West
Indies
,
that
the
vacant
shop
in
the
market
-
place
at
Grimworth
be
understand
to
have
be
let
to
the
stranger
with
a
sallow
complexion
and
a
buff
cravat
,
<EOS>
whose
first
appearance
have
cause
some
excitement
in
the
bar
of
the
Woolpack
,
where
he
have
call
to
wait
for
the
coach
.
  
<EOS>
Grimworth
,
to
a
discerning
eye
,
be
a
good
place
to
set
up
shopkeepe
in
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
competition
in
it
at
present
;
the
Church
-
people
have
their
own
grocer
and
draper
;
the
Dissenters
have
theirs
;
and
the
two
or
three
butcher
find
a
ready
market
for
their
joint
without
strict
reference
to
religious
persuasion
 
except
that
the
rector
's
wife
have
give
a
general
order
for
the
veal
sweet
-
bread
and
the
mutton
kidney
,
while
Mr.
Rodd
,
the
Baptist
minister
,
have
request
that
,
so
far
as
be
compatible
with
the
fair
accommodation
of
other
customer
,
the
sheep
's
trotter
may
be
reserve
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
likely
to
be
a
grow
place
,
for
the
trustee
of
Mr.
Zephaniah
Crypt
's
Charity
,
under
the
stimulus
of
a
late
visitation
by
commissioner
,
be
begin
to
apply
long
-
accumulate
fund
to
the
rebuilding
of
the
Yellow
Coat
School
,
which
be
henceforth
to
be
carry
forward
on
a
greatly
-
extended
scale
,
the
testator
have
leave
no
restriction
concern
the
curriculum
,
but
only
concern
the
coat
.
  
<EOS>
the
shopkeeper
at
Grimworth
be
by
no
means
unanimous
as
to
the
advantage
promise
by
this
prospect
of
increase
population
and
trading
,
be
substantial
man
,
who
like
do
a
quiet
business
in
which
they
be
sure
of
their
customer
,
and
could
calculate
their
return
to
a
nicety
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
it
have
be
hold
a
point
of
honour
by
the
family
in
Grimworth
parish
,
to
buy
their
sugar
and
their
flannel
at
the
shop
where
their
father
and
mother
have
buy
before
them
;
but
,
if
newcomer
be
to
bring
in
the
system
of
neck
-
and
-
neck
trading
,
and
solicit
feminine
eye
by
gown
-
piece
lay
in
fan
-
like
fold
,
and
surmount
by
artificial
flower
,
give
them
a
factitious
charm
(
for
on
<EOS>
what
human
figure
would
a
gown
sit
like
a
fan
,
or
what
female
head
be
like
a
bunch
of
China
-
aster
?
)
<EOS>
,
or
,
if
new
grocer
be
to
fill
their
window
with
mountain
of
currant
and
sugar
,
make
seductive
by
contrast
and
ticket
,
 
<EOS>
what
security
be
there
for
Grimworth
,
that
a
vagrant
spirit
in
shopping
,
once
introduce
,
would
not
in
the
end
carry
the
most
important
family
to
the
large
market
town
of
Cattleton
,
where
,
business
be
do
on
a
system
of
small
profit
and
quick
return
,
the
fashion
be
of
the
fresh
,
and
good
of
all
kind
may
be
buy
at
an
advantage
?
  
<EOS>
with
this
view
of
the
time
predominant
among
the
tradespeople
at
Grimworth
,
their
uncertainty
concern
the
nature
of
the
business
which
the
sallow
-
complexioned
stranger
be
about
to
set
up
in
the
vacant
shop
,
naturally
give
some
additional
strength
to
the
fear
of
the
less
sanguine
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
go
to
sell
drapery
,
it
be
probable
that
a
pale
-
faced
fellow
like
that
would
deal
in
showy
and
inferior
article
 
print
cotton
and
muslin
which
would
leave
their
dye
in
the
wash
-
tub
,
job
linen
full
of
knot
,
and
flannel
that
would
soon
look
like
gauze
.
 
<EOS>
if
grocery
,
then
it
be
to
be
hope
that
no
mother
of
a
family
would
trust
the
tea
of
an
untried
grocer
.
 
<EOS>
such
thing
have
be
know
in
some
parish
as
tradesman
go
about
canvass
for
custom
with
card
in
their
pocket
:
when
people
come
from
nobody
know
where
,
there
be
no
know
what
they
may
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
thousand
pity
that
Mr.
Moffat
,
the
auctioneer
and
broker
,
have
die
without
leave
anybody
to
follow
him
in
the
business
,
and
Mrs.
Cleve
's
trustee
ought
to
have
know
better
than
to
let
a
shop
to
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
discovery
that
oven
be
be
put
up
on
the
premise
,
and
that
the
shop
be
,
in
fact
,
be
fit
up
for
a
confectioner
and
pastry
-
cook
's
business
,
hitherto
unknown
in
Grimworth
,
do
not
quite
suffice
to
turn
the
scale
in
the
newcomer
's
favour
,
though
the
landlady
at
the
Woolpack
defend
him
warmly
,
say
he
seem
to
be
a
very
clever
young
man
,
and
from
what
she
could
make
out
,
come
of
a
very
good
family
;
indeed
,
be
most
likely
a
good
many
people
's
better
.
  
<EOS>
It
certainly
make
a
blaze
of
light
and
colour
,
almost
as
if
a
rainbow
have
suddenly
descend
into
the
market
-
place
,
when
,
one
fine
morning
,
the
shutter
be
take
down
from
the
new
shop
,
and
the
two
window
display
their
decoration
.
 
<EOS>
on
one
side
,
there
be
the
variegated
tint
of
collared
and
marbled
meat
,
set
off
by
bright
green
leave
,
the
pale
brown
of
glaze
pie
,
the
rich
tone
of
sauce
and
bottled
fruit
enclose
in
their
veil
of
glass
 
altogether
a
sight
to
bring
tear
into
the
eye
of
a
dutch
painter
;
and
on
the
other
,
there
be
a
predominance
of
the
more
delicate
hue
of
pink
,
and
white
,
and
yellow
,
and
buff
,
in
the
abundant
lozenge
,
candy
,
sweet
biscuit
and
icing
,
which
to
the
eye
of
a
bilious
person
may
easily
have
be
blend
into
a
faery
landscape
in
Turner
's
late
style

<EOS>
what
a
sight
to
dawn
upon
the
eye
of
Grimworth
child
!
 
<EOS>
They
almost
forget
to
go
to
their
dinner
that
day
,
their
appetite
be
preoccupy
with
imaginary
sugar

plum
;
and
I
think
even
Punch
,
set
up
his
tabernacle
in
the
market

place
,
would
not
have
succeed
in
draw
them
away

the
little

the
outermost

lift
wide

open
eye
and
mouth
towards
the
upper

of

like

<EOS>
the

inhabitant
pishe

a
little

the
folly
of
the
new

in
venture
on
such
an
outlay
in
good
that
would
not
keep

to
be
sure
,
Christmas
be
come

but
what
housewife
in
Grimworth
would
not
think
shame
to
furnish
forth
her
table
with
article
that
be
not

no

no

Mr.

a

Mr.

he

for

find
Mr.

the

aristocratic

of

seem
likely
at

justify
their

confidence
that
they

never
pay
a
percentage
of

on
drop

instead
of
make
their

get
up
a

show
of
liberal
housekeeping
by
purchase
slice
of
collar
meat
when
a
neighbour
come
in
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
my
task
to
narrate
the
gradual
corruption
of
Grimworth
manner
from
their
primitive
simplicity
 
a
melancholy
task
,
if
it

cheer

It
be
young

to
temptation

<EOS>
I
fear
she
have
be
rather
over
-
educate
for
her
station

for
she
know
by
heart
many
passage
in
Lalla
Rookh
,
the
Corsair
,
and
the
Siege
of
Corinth
,
which
have
give
her
a
distaste
for
domestic
occupation
,
and
cause
her
a
withering
disappointment
at
the
discovery
that
Mr.
Steene
,
since
his
marriage
,
have
lose
all
interest
in
the
"
bulbul

"
openly
prefer
discuss
the
nature
of
spavin
with
a
coarse
neighbour
,
and
be
angry
if
the

turn
out
watery
 
indeed
,
be
simply
a
top

boot
"
vet

"
,
who
come
in
hungry
at
dinner

time
;
and
not
in
the
least
like
a
nobleman
turn
Corsair
out
of
pure
scorn
for
his
race
,
or
like
a
renegade
with
a
turban
and
crescent

unless
it
be
in
the
irritability

<EOS>
and
scorn
be
such
a
very
different

in

<EOS>
this
brutal
man
have
invite
a
supper
-
party
for
Christmas
eve
,
when
he
would
expect
to
see
mince
-
pie
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Steene
have
prepare
her
mince
-
meat
,
and
have
devote
much
butter
,
fine
flour
,
and
labour
,
to
the
making
of
a
batch
of
pie
in
the
morning
;
but
they
prove
to
be
so
very
heavy
when
they
come
out
of
the
oven
,
that
she
could
only
think
with
tremble
of
the
moment
when
her
husband
should
catch
sight
of
them
on
the
supper
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
storm
at
her
<EOS>
,
she
be
certain
;
and
before
all
the
company
;
and
then
she
should
never
help
cry
:
it
be
so
dreadful
to
think
she
have
come
to
that
,
after
the
bulbul
and
everything
!
 
<EOS>
suddenly
the
thought
dart
through
her
mind
that
this
once
she
may
send
for
a
dish
of
mince
-
pie
from
Freely
's
:
she
know
he
have
some
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
to
become
of
the
eighteen
heavy
mince
-
pie
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
of
no
use
think
about
that
;
it
be
very
expensive
 
indeed
,
make
mince
-
pie
at
all
be
a
great
expense
,
when
they
be
not
sure
to
turn
out
well
:
it
would
be
much
well
to
buy
them
ready
-
make
.
 
<EOS>
You
pay
a
little
more
for
them
,
but
there
be
no
risk
of
waste
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
sophistry
with
which
this
misguide
young
woman
 
enough
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Steene
send
for
the
mince
-
pie
,
and
,
I
be
grieve
to
add
,
garble
her
household
account
in
order
to
conceal
the
fact
from
her
husband
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
second
step
in
a
downward
course
,
all
owe
to
a
young
woman
's
be
out
of
harmony
with
her
circumstance
,
yearn
after
renegade
and
bulbul
,
and
be
subject
to
claim
from
a
veterinary
surgeon
fond
of
mince
-
pie
.
 
<EOS>
the
third
step
be
to
harden
herself
by
tell
the
fact
of
the
buy
mince
-
pie
to
her
intimate
friend
Mrs.
Mole
,
who
have
already
guess
it
,
and
who
subsequently
encourage
herself
in
buy
a
mould
of
jelly
,
instead
of
exert
her
own
skill
,
by
the
reflection
that
"
other
people
"
do
the
same
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
the
infection
spread
;
soon
there
be
a
party
or
clique
in
Grimworth
on
the
side
of
"
buy
at
Freely
's
"
;
and
many
husband
,
keep
for
some
time
in
the
dark
on
this
point
,
innocently
swallow
at
two
mouthful
a
tart
on
which
they
be
pay
a
profit
of
a
hundred
per
cent
.
,
and
as
innocently
encourage
a
fatal
disingenuousness
in
the
partner
of
their
bosom
by
praise
the
pastry
.
 
<EOS>
other
,
more
keen

wink
at
the
too
frequent
presentation
on

and
at
impromptu
supper

of
superior

beef

which
flatter
their

every
housewife

"

feel
a
secret
joy
when
she
detect
a
similar
perversion
in
her

and
soon
only
two

three

mistress

hold
out
in
the
protest
against
the
grow
demoralization

"
I

<EOS>
the

whose

the
curate

who
keep
no

and
the
mining
agent

who
be

even
begin

rely
on
Freely
for
the
great
part
of
their
dinner
,
when
they
wish
to
give
an
entertainment
of
some
brilliancy

<EOS>
in
short
,
the
business
of
manufacture
the
more
fanciful
viand
be
fast
pass
out
of
the
hind
of
maid
and
matron
in
private
family
,
and
be
become
the
work
of
a
special
commercial
organ
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
ignorant
that
this
sort
of
thing
be
call
the
inevitable
course
of
civilization
,
division
of
labour
,
and
so
forth
,
and
that
the
maid
and
matron
may
be
say
to
have
have
their
hand
set
free
from
cookery
to
add
to
the
wealth
of
society
in
some
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
only
it
happen
at
Grimworth
,
which
,
to
be
sure
,
be
a
low
place
,
that
the
maid
and
matron
could
do
nothing
with
their
hand
at
all
well
than
cook
:
not
even
those
who
have
always
make
heavy
cake
and
leathery
pastry
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
come
to
pass
,
that
the
progress
of
civilization
at
Grimworth
be
not
otherwise
apparent
than
in
the
impoverishment
of
man
,
the
gossip
idleness
of
woman
,
and
the
heighten
prosperity
of
Mr.
Edward
Freely
.
  
<EOS>
the
Yellow
Coat
School
be
a
double
source
of
profit
to
the
calculate
confectioner
;
for
he
open
an
eat
-
room
for
the
superior
workman
employ
on
the
new
school
,
and
he
accommodate
the
pupil
at
the
old
school
by
give
great
attention
to
the
fancy
-
sugar
department
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
the
sweet
-
tasted
swans
and
other
ingenious
white
shape
crunch
by
the
small
tooth
of
that
rise
generation
,
I
be
glad
to
remember
that
a
certain
amount
of
calcareous
food
have
be
hold
good
for
young
creature
whose
bone
be
not
quite
form
;
for
I
have
observe
these
delicacy
to
have
an
inorganic
flavour
which
would
have
recommend
them
greatly
to
that
young
lady
of
the
Spectator
's
acquaintance
who
habitually
make
her
dessert
on
the
stem
of
tobacco
-
pipe
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
confectioner
himself
,
he
make
his
way
gradually
into
Grimworth
home
,
as
his
commodity
do
,
in
spite
of
some
initial
repugnance
.
<EOS>
somehow
or
other
,
his
reception
as
a
guest
seem
a
thing
that
require
justify
,
like
the
purchasing
of
his
pastry
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
be
a
stranger
,
and
therefore
open
to
suspicion
;
secondly
,
the
confectionery
business
be
so
entirely
new
at
Grimworth
,
that
its
place
in
the
scale
of
rank
have
not
be
distinctly
ascertain
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
about
draper
and
grocer
,
when
they
come
of
good
old
Grimworth
family
,
like
Mr.
Luff
and
Mr.
Prettyman
<EOS>
:
they
visit
with
the
Palfreys
,
who
farm
their
own
land
,
play
many
a
game
at
whist
with
the
doctor
,
and
condescend
a
little
towards
the
timber
-
merchant
,
who
have
lately
take
to
the
coal
-
trade
also
,
and
have
get
new
furniture
;
but
whether
a
confectioner
should
be
admit
to
this
high
level
of
respectability
,
or
should
be
understand
to
find
his
associate
among
butcher
and
baker
,
be
a
new
question
on
which
tradition
throw
no
light
.
 
<EOS>
His
be
a
bachelor
be
in
his
favour
,
and
would
perhaps
have
be
enough
to
turn
the
scale
,
even
if
Mr.
Edward
Freely
's
other
personal
pretension
have
be
of
an
entirely
insignificant
cast
.
 
<EOS>
but
so
far
from
this
,
it
very
soon
appear
that
he
be
a
remarkable
young
man
,
who
have
be
in
the
West
Indies
,
and
have
see
many
wonder
by
sea
and
land
,
so
that
he
could
charm
the
ear
of
Grimworth
Desdemonas
with
story
of
strange
fish
,
especially
shark
,
which
he
have
stab
in
the
nick
of
time
by
bravely
plunge
overboard
just
as
the
monster
be
turn
on
his
side
to
devour
the
cook
's
mate
;
of
terrible
fever
which
he
have
undergo
in
a
land
where
the
wind
blow
from
all
quarter
at
once
;
of
round
of
toast
cut
straight
from
the
breadfruit
tree
;
of
toe
bite
off
by
land
-
crab
;
of
large
honour
that
have
be
offer
to
him
as
a
man
who
know
what
be
what
,
and
be
therefore
particularly
need
in
a
tropical
climate
;
and
of
a
Creole
heiress
who
have
weep
bitterly
at
his
departure

<EOS>
such
conversational
talent
as
these

we

disadvantage

quite
eclipse

the

the
sallow
Mr.

<EOS>
so
exceptional
a

elevate
the
business

may
well
begin
to
make
disengaged
heart
flutter
a

<EOS>
father

be
naturally
more
slow

cautious
in

<EOS>
"
He
be
an
amusing
fellow

say
Mr.

the
highly
respectable
grocer

<EOS>
(
Mrs.
Prettyman

London
mercer

<EOS>
"
He
be
an
amusing
fellow
;
and
I
have
no
objection
to
his
make
one
at
the
Oyster
Club

but
he
be
a
bit
too
fond
of
ride
the
high

He
be
uncommonly
know

I
will
allow

but
how
come
he
to
go
to
the

<EOS>
I
should
like
that
answer

<EOS>
It
be
unnatural
in
a
confectioner

I
be
not
fond
of
people
that
have
be
beyond

if
they
can
not
give
a
good
account
how
they
happen
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
when
folk
go
so
far
off
,
it
be
because
they
have
get
little
credit
nearer
home
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
get
some
good
rum
;
but
I
do
not
want
to
be
hand
and
glove
with
him
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
this
kind
of
dim
suspicion
which
becloud
the
view
of
Mr.
Freely
's
quality
in
the
maturer
mind
of
Grimworth
through
the
early
month
of
his
residence
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
the
confectioner
cease
to
be
a
novelty
,
the
suspicion
also
cease
to
be
novel
,
and
people
get
tired
of
hint
at
them
,
especially
as
they
seem
to
be
refute
by
his
advance
prosperity
and
importance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Freely
be
become
a
person
of
influence
in
the
parish
;
he
be
find
useful
as
an
overseer
of
the
poor
,
have
great
firmness
in
endure
other
people

pain
,
which
firmness
,
he
say
,
be
due
to
his
great
benevolence

he
always
do
what
be
good
for
people
in
the
end

<EOS>
Mr.
Chaloner
have
even
select
him
as
clergyman

churchwarden
,
for
he
be
a
very
handy
man
,
and
much
more
of
Mr.
Chaloner

opinion
in
everything
about
church
business

the
old
parishioner

<EOS>
Mr.
Freely
be
a
very
regular
churchman
,
but
at
the
Oyster
Club
he
be
sometimes
a
little
free
in
his
conversation
,
more
than
hint
at
a
life
of
sultanic
self
-
indulgence
which
he
have
pass
in
the
West
Indies
,
shake
his
head
now
and
then
and
smile
rather
bitterly
,
as
man
be
will
not
to
do
when
they
intimate
that
they
have
become
a
little
too
wise
to
be
instruct
about
a
world
which
have
long
be
flat

stale
to
them

<EOS>
for
some
time
he
be
quite
general
in
his
attention
to
the
fair
sex
,
combine
the
gallantry
of
a
lady
's
man
with
a
severity
of
criticism
on
the
person

manner
of
absent
belle

which
tend
rather
to
stimulate
in
the
feminine
breast
the
desire
to
conquer
the
approval
of
so
fastidious
a
judge
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
short
of
the
very
good
in
the
department
of
female
charm
and
virtue
could
suffice
to
kindle
the
ardour
of
Mr.
Edward
Freely
,
who
have
become
familiar
with
the
most
luxuriant
and
dazzling
beauty
in
the
West
Indies
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
seem
incredible
that
a
confectioner
should
have
idea
and
conversation
so
much
resemble
those
to
be
meet
with
in
a
high
walk
of
life
,
but
it
must
be
remember
that
he
have
not
merely
travel
,
he
have
also
bow
-
leg
and
a
sallow
,
small
-
featured
visage
,
so
that
nature
herself
have
stamp
him
for
a
fastidious
connoisseur
of
the
fair
sex
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
it
seem
clear
that
Cupid
have
find
a
sharp
arrow
than
usual
,
and
that
Mr.
Freely
's
heart
be
pierce
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
general
talk
among
the
young
people
at
Grimworth
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
it
really
love
,
and
not
rather
ambition
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Fullilove
,
the
timber
-
merchant
's
daughter
,
be
quite
sure
that
if
she
be
Miss
Penny
Palfrey
,
she
would
be
cautious
;
it
be
not
a
good
sign
when
man
look
so
much
above
themselves
for
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
no
less
a
person
than
Miss
Penelope
Palfrey
,
second
daughter
of
the
Mr.
Palfrey
who
farm
his
own
land
,
that
have
attract
Mr.
Freely
's
peculiar
regard
,
and
conquer
his
fastidiousness
;
and
no
wonder
,
for
the
Ideal
,
as
exhibit
in
the
fine
waxwork
,
be
perhaps
never
so
closely
approach
by
the
Real
as
in
the
person
of
the
pretty
Penelope
.
 
<EOS>
Her
yellowish
flaxen
hair
do
not
curl
naturally
,
I
admit
,
but
its
bright
crisp
ringlet
be
such
smooth
,
perfect
miniature
tube
,
that
you
would
have
long
to
pass
your
little
finger
through
them
,
and
feel
their
soft
elasticity
.
 
<EOS>
She
wear
them
in
a
crop
,
for
in
those
day
,
when
society
be
in
a
healthy
state
,
young
lady
wear
crop
long
after
they
be
twenty
,
and
Penelope
be
not
yet
nineteen
.
 
<EOS>
like
the
waxen
ideal
,
she
have
round
blue
eye
,
and
round
nostril
in
her
little
nose
,
and
tooth
such
as
the
ideal
would
be
see
to
have
,
if
it
ever
show
them
.
<EOS>
altogether
,
she
be
a
small
,
round
thing
,
as
neat
as
a
pink
and
white
double
daisy
,
and
as
guileless
;
for
I
hope
it
do
not
argue
guile
in
a
pretty
damsel
of
nineteen
,
to
think
that
she
should
like
to
have
a
beau
and
be
"
engage
,
"
when
her
eld
sister
have
already
be
in
that
position
a
year
and
a
half
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
there
be
young
tower
always
come
to
the
house
;
but
Penny
feel
convinced
he
only
come
to
see
her
brother
,
for
he
never
have
anything
to
say
to
her
,
and
never
offer
her
his
arm
,
and
be
as
awkward
and
silent
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
unlikely
that
Mr.
Freely
have
early
be
smite
by
Penny
's
charm
,
as
bring
under
his
observation
at
church
,
but
he
have
to
make
his
way
in
society
a
little
before
he
could
come
into
nearer
contact
with
them
;
and
even
after
he
be
well
receive
in
Grimworth
family
,
it
be
a
long
while
before
he
could
converse
with
Penny
otherwise
than
in
an
incidental
meeting
at
Mr.
Luff
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
easy
to
get
invite
to
Long
Meadows
,
the
residence
of
the
Palfreys
;
for
though
Mr.
Palfrey
have
be
lose
money
of
late
year
,
not
be
able
quite
to
recover
his
foot
after
the
terrible
murrain
which
force
him
to
borrow
,
his
family
be
far
from
consider
themselves
on
the
same
level
even
as
the
old
-
establish
tradespeople
with
whom
they
visit
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
people
,
even
king
and
queen
,
must
visit
with
somebody
,
and
the
equal
of
the
great
be
scarce
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
especially
scarce
at
Grimworth
,
which
,
as
I
have
before
observe
,
be
a
low
parish
,
mention
with
the
most
scornful
brevity
in
gazetteer
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
great
people
there
be
far
behind
those
of
their
own
standing
in
other
part
of
this
realm
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Palfrey
's
farmyard
door
have
the
paint
<EOS>
all
wear
off
them
,
and
the
front
garden
walk
have
long
be
merge
in
a
general
weediness
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
his
father
have
be
call
Squire
Palfrey
,
and
have
be
respect
by
the
last
Grimworth
generation
as
a
man
who
could
afford
to
drink
too
much
in
his
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
Pretty
Penny
be
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
Mr.
Freely
admire
her
,
and
she
feel
sure
that
it
be
he
who
have
send
her
a
beautiful
valentine
;
but
her
sister
seem
to
think
so
lightly
of
him
(
all
young
lady
think
lightly
of
the
gentleman
to
whom
they
be
not
engage
)
,
that
Penny
never
dare
mention
him
,
and
tremble
and
blush
whenever
they
meet
him
,
think
of
the
valentine
,
which
be
very
strong
in
its
expression
,
and
which
she
feel
guilty
of
know
by
heart
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
who
have
be
to
the
Indies
,
and
know
the
sea
so
well
,
seem
to
her
a
sort
of
public
character
,
almost
like
Robinson
Crusoe
or
Captain
Cook
;
and
Penny
have
always
wish
her
husband
to
be
a
remarkable
personage
,
likely
to
be
put
in
Mangnall
's
Questions
,
with
which
register
of
the
immortal
she
have
become
acquaint
during
her
one
year
at
a
boarding
-
school
.
 
<EOS>
only
it
seem
strange
that
a
remarkable
man
should
be
a
confectioner
and
pastry
-
cook
,
and
this
anomaly
quite
disturb
Penny
's
dream
.
 
<EOS>
Her
brother
,
she
know
,
laugh
at
man
who
could
not
sit
on
horseback
well
,
and
call
them
tailor
;
but
her
brother
be
very
rough
,
and
be
quite
without
that
power
of
anecdote
which
make
Mr.
Freely
such
a
delightful
companion
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
good
man
<EOS>
,
she
think
,
for
she
have
hear
him
say
at
Mr.
Luff
's
,
one
day
,
that
he
always
wish
to
do
his
duty
in
whatever
state
of
life
he
may
be
place
;
and
he
know
a
great
deal
of
poetry
,
for
one
day
he
have
repeat
a
verse
of
a
song
.
 
<EOS>
She
wonder
if
he
have
make
the
word
of
the
valentine
!
 
<EOS>
it
end
in
this
way
:
       
<EOS>
"
without
thee
,
it
be
pain
to
live
,
   
<EOS>
but
with
thee
,
it
be
sweet
to
die
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Freely
!
<EOS>
her
father
would
very
likely
object
 
<EOS>
she
feel
sure
he
would
,
for
he
always
call
Mr.
Freely
"
that
sugar
-
plum
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
very
cruel
,
when
true
love
be
cross
in
that
way
,
and
all
because
Mr.
Freely
be
a
confectioner
:
well
,
Penny
would
be
true
to
him
,
for
all
that
,
and
since
his
be
a
confectioner
give
her
an
opportunity
of
show
her
faithfulness
,
she
be
glad
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
Freely
be
a
pretty
name
,
much
well
than
John
Towers
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Towers
have
offer
her
a
rose
out
of
his
button
-
hole
the
other
day
,
blush
very
much
;
but
she
refuse
it
,
and
think
with
delight
how
much
Mr.
Freely
would
be
comfort
if
he
know
her
firmness
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
poor
little
penny
!
<EOS>
the
day
be
so
very
long
among
the
daisy
on
a
graze
farm
,
and
thought
be
so
active
 
<EOS>
how
be
it
possible
that
the
inward
drama
should
not
get
the
start
of
the
outward
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
young
lady
,
much
better
educate
,
and
with
an
outward
world
diversify
by
instructive
lecture
,
to
say
nothing
of
literature
and
highly
-
develop
fancy
-
work
,
who
have
spin
a
cocoon
of
visionary
joy
and
sorrow
for
themselves
,
just
as
Penny
do
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eld
sister
Letitia
,
who
have
a
prouder
style
of
beauty
,
and
a
more
worldly
ambition
,
be
engage
to
a
wool
-
factor
,
who
come
all
the
way
from
Cattelton
to
see
her
;
and
everybody
know
that
a
wool
-
factor
take
a
very
high
rank
,
sometimes
drive
a
double
-
bodied
gig
.
 
<EOS>
Letty
's
notion
get
high
every
day
,
and
Penny
never
dare
to
speak
of
her
cherish
griefs
to
her
lofty
sister
 
never
dare
to
propose
that
they
should
call
at
Mr.
Freely
's
to
buy
liquorice
,
though
she
have
prepare
for
such
an
incident
by
mention
a
slight
sore
throat
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
have
to
pass
the
shop
on
the
other
side
of
the
market
-
place
,
and
reflect
,
with
a
suppress
sigh
,
that
behind
those
pink
and
white
jar
somebody
be
think
of
her
tenderly
,
unconscious
of
the
small
space
that
divide
her
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
it
be
quite
true
that
,
when
business
permit
,
Mr.
Freely
think
a
great
deal
of
Penny
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
her
prettiness
comparable
to
the
lovely
thing
in
confectionery
;
he
judge
her
to
be
of
submissive
temper
 
likely
to
wait
upon
him
as
well
as
if
she
have
be
a
negress
,
and
to
be
silently
terrified
when
his
liver
make
him
irritable
;
and
he
consider
the
Palfrey
family
quite
the
good
in
the
parish
,
possess
marriageable
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
he
think
her
worthy
to
become
Mrs.
Edward
Freely
,
and
all
the
more
so
,
because
it
would
probably
require
some
ingenuity
to
win
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Palfrey
be
capable
of
horse
-
whip
a
too
rash
pretender
to
his
daughter
's
hand
;
and
,
moreover
,
he
have
three
tall
son
:
it
be
clear
that
a
suitor
would
be
at
a
disadvantage
with
such
a
family
,
unless
travel
and
natural
acuman
have
give
him
a
countervail
power
of
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
first
idea
that
occur
to
him
in
the
matter
be
,
that
Mr.
Palfrey
would
object
less
if
he
know
that
the
Freelys
be
a
much
high
family
than
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
foolish
modesty
in
him
hitherto
to
conceal
the
fact
that
a
branch
of
the
Freelys
hold
a
manor
in
Yorkshire
,
and
to
shut
up
the
portrait
of
his
great
uncle
the
admiral
,
instead
of
hang
it
up
where
a
family
portrait
should
be
hang
 
over
the
mantelpiece
in
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
Admiral
Freely
,
K.C.B.
,
once
place
in
this
conspicuous
position
,
be
see
to
have
have
one
arm
only
,
and
one
eye
 
in
these
point
resemble
the
heroic
Nelson
 
while
a
certain
pallid
insignificance
of
feature
confirm
the
relationship
between
himself
and
his
grand

<EOS>
next

Mr.
Freely
be
seize
with
an
irrepressible
ambition

posse
Mrs.
Palfrey

her

be
superior

very
flattering

<EOS>
now
Mrs.
Palfrey
,
like
other
genius
,
work
by
instinct
rather
than
by
rule
,
and
possess
no
receipt
 
indeed
,
despise
all
people
who
use
them
,
observe
that
people
who
pickle
by
book
,
must
pickle
by
weight
and
measure
,
and
such
nonsense

as
for
herself
,
her
weight
and
measure
be
the
tip
of
her
finger
and
the
tip
of
her
tongue
,
and
if
you
go
near
,
why
,
of
course
,
for
dry
good
like
flour
and
spice
,
you
go
by
handful
and

and
for
wet

there
be
a
middle

sized
jug
 
quite
the
good
thing
whether
for

because
you
may
know
how
much
a
teacupful
be
if
you
would
get
any
use
of
your
sense

and
you
may
be
sure
it
would
take
five
middle

<EOS>
knowledge
of
this
kind

like
Titian

colouring

difficult

communicate

and
as
Mrs.
Palfrey
,
once
remarkably
handsome
,
have
now
become
rather
stout
and
asthmatical
,
and
scarcely
ever
leave
home
,
her
oral
teaching
could
hardly
be
give
anywhere
except
at
Long
Meadows

even
a

the
prospect

visitor

great
object
would
be
to
listen
to

be
not

its
charm

Mrs.

since
there

<EOS>
in
this
way

Mr.

get
himself
introduce
into
the
home
of
the
Palfreys

notwithstanding
a
tendency
in
the
male
part
of
the

to
jeer
at
him
a
little
as
"
peaky
"
and
bow

he
presently
establish
his
position
as
an
accepted

frequent

<EOS>
Young

look

increase
disgust

Sunday

and
secretly
long

try
his

as
a

<EOS>
but
 
so
blind

<EOS>
neither
Mr.

Mrs.
Palfrey
suspect
that
Penny

have
anything
to
say
to
a
tradesman
of
questionable
rank
whose
youthful
bloom
be
much
wither

<EOS>
young
Towers

they
think
,
have
an
eye
to
her

and
that
be
likely
enough
to
be
a
match
some
day

but
Penny
be
a

<EOS>
and
all
the

Penny
be

the
circumstance
under
which
Mr.

would
make
her
an
offer
:
perhaps
down
by
the
row
of
damson
-
tree
,
when
they
be
in
the
garden
before
tea
;
perhaps
by
letter
 
in
which
case
,
how
would
the
letter
begin
?
 
<EOS>
"
dearest
penelope

"
or
"
My
dear
Miss
Penelope
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
or
straight
off

without
dear
anything

as
seem
the
most
natural
when
people
be
embarrassed

<EOS>
but
,
however
he
may
make
the
offer
,
she
would
not
accept
it
without
her

consent

she
would

be
true
to
Mr.
Freely

but
she
would
not
disobey
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
for
Penny
be
a
good
girl
,
though
some
of
her
female
friend
be
afterwards
of
opinion
that
it
speak
ill
for
her
not
to
have
feel
an
instinctive
repugnance
to
Mr.
Freely
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
cautious
,
and
wish
to
be
quite
sure
of
the
ground
he
tread
on
.
 
<EOS>
His
view
on
marriage
be
not
entirely
sentimental
,
but
be
as
duly
mingle
with
consideration
of
what
would
be
advantageous
to
a
man
in
his
position
,
as
if
he
have
have
a
very
large
amount
of
money
spend
on
his
education
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
man
to
fall
in
love
in
the
wrong
place
;
and
so
,
he
apply
himself
quite
as
much
to
conciliate
the
favour
of
the
parent
,
as
to
secure
the
attachment
of
Penny
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Palfrey
have
not
be
inaccessible
to
flattery
,
and
her
husband
,
be
also
of
mortal
mould
,
would
not
,
it
may
be
hope
,
be
proof
against
rum
 
that
very
fine
Jamaica
rum
 
of
which
Mr.
Freely
expect
always
to
have
a
supply
send
him
from
Jamaica
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
to
get
Mr.
Palfrey
into
the
parlour
behind
the
shop
,
where
a
mild
back
-
street
light
fall
on
the
feature
of
the
heroic
admiral
;
but
by
get
hold
of
him
rather
late
one
evening
as
he
be
about
to
return
home
from
Grimworth
,
the
aspire
lover
succeed
in
persuade
him
to
sup
on
some
collar
beef
which
,
after
Mrs.
Palfrey
's
brawn
,
he
would
find
the
very
good
of
cold
eating
.
  
<EOS>
from
that
hour
Mr.
Freely
feel
sure
of
success
:
be
in
privacy
with
an
estimable
man
old
enough
to
be
his
father
,
and
be
rather
lonely
in
the
world
,
it
be
natural
he
should
unbosom
himself
a
little
on
subject
which
he
could
not
speak
of
in
a
mixed
circle
 
especially
concern
his
expectation
from
his
uncle
in
Jamaica
,
who
have
no
child
,
and
love
his
nephew
Edward
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
,
though
he
have
be
so
hurt
at
his
leave
Jamaica
,
that
he
have
threaten
to
cut
him
off
with
a
shilling
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
have
since
write
to
state
his
full
forgiveness
,
and
though
he
be
an
eccentric
old
gentleman
and
could
not
bear
to
give
away
money
during
his
life
,
Mr.
Edward
Freely
could
show
Mr.
Palfrey
the
letter
which
declare
,
plainly
enough
,
who
would
be
the
affectionate
uncle
's
heir
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Palfrey
actually
see
the
letter
,
and
could
not
help
admire
the
spirit
of
the
nephew
who
declare
that
such
brilliant
hope
as
these
make
no
difference
to
his
conduct
;
he
should
work
at
his
humble
business
and
make
his
modest
fortune
at
it
all
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
Jamaica
estate
be
to
come
to
him
 
well
and
good
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
very
surprising
for
one
of
the
Freely
family
to
have
an
estate
leave
him
,
consider
the
land
that
family
have
possess
in
time
go
by
 
nay
,
still
possess
in
the
Northumberland
branch
.
 
<EOS>
Would
not
Mr.
Palfrey
take
another
glass
of
rum
?
<EOS>
and
also
look
at
the
last
year
's
balance
of
the
account
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Freely
be
a
man
who
care
to
possess
personal
virtue
,
and
do
not
pique
himself
on
his
family
,
though
some
man
would
.
  
<EOS>
We
know
how
easily
the
great
Leviathan
may
be
lead
,
when
once
there
be
a
hook
in
his
nose
or
a
bridle
in
his
jaw
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Palfrey
be
a
large
man
,
but
,
like
Leviathan
's
,
his
bulk
go
against
him
when
once
he
have
take
a
turning
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
mercurial
man
,
who
easily
change
his
point
of
view
.
 
<EOS>
enough
.
 
<EOS>
before
two
month
be
over
,
he
have
give
his
consent
to
Mr.
Freely
's
marriage
with
his
daughter
Penny
,
and
have
hit
on
a
formula
by
which
he
could
justify
it
,
fence
off
all
doubt
and
objection
,
his
own
include
.
 
<EOS>
the
formula
be
this
:
"
I
be
not
a
man
to
put
my
head
up
an
entry
before
I
know
where
it
lead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Little
Penny
be
very
proud
and
fluttering
,
but
hardly
so
happy
as
she
expect
to
be
in
an
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
She
wonder
if
young
Towers
care
much
about
it
,
for
he
have
not
be
to
the
house
lately
,
and
her
sister
and
brother
be
rather
inclined
to
sneer
than
to
sympathize
.
 
<EOS>
Grimworth
ring
with
the
news
.
 
<EOS>
all
man
extoll
Mr.
Freely
's
good
fortune
;
while
the
woman
,
with
the
tender
solicitude
characteristic
of
the
sex
,
wish
the
marriage
may
turn
out
well
.
  
<EOS>
while
affair
be
at
this
triumphant
juncture
,
Mr.
Freely
one
morning
observe
that
a
stone
-
carver
who
have
be
breakfast
in
the
eat
-
room
have
leave
a
newspaper
behind
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
x
-
shire
Gazette
,
and
x
-
shire
<EOS>
be
a
county
not
unknown
to
Mr.
Freely
,
he
feel
some
curiosity
to
glance
over
it
,
and
especially
over
the
advertisement
.
 
<EOS>
a
slight
flush
come
over
his
face
as
he
read
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
produce
by
the
follow
announcement
:
 
"
<EOS>
if
David
Faux
,
son
of
Jonathan
Faux
,
late
of
Gilsbrook
,
will
apply
at
the
office
of
Mr.
Strutt
,
attorney
,
of
Rodham
,
he
will
hear
of
something
to
his
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
's
dead
!
"
exclaim
Mr.
Freely
,
involuntarily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
he
have
leave
me
a
legacy
?
"
    
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
a
result
quite
different
from
your
expectation
,
that
Mr.
David
Faux
should
have
return
from
the
West
Indies
only
a
few
year
after
his
arrival
there
,
and
have
set
up
in
his
old
business
,
like
any
plain
man
who
have
never
travel
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
case
do
occur
in
life
.
<EOS>
since
,
as
we
know
,
man
change
their
sky
and
see
new
constellation
without
change
their
soul
,
it
will
follow
sometimes
that
they
do
not
change
their
business
under
those
novel
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
certainly
,
this
result
be
contrary
to
David
's
own
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
look
forward
<EOS>
,
you
be
aware
,
to
a
brilliant
career
among
"
the
black
"
;
but
,
either
because
they
have
already
see
too
many
white
man
,
or
for
some
other
reason
,
they
do
not
at
once
recognize
him
as
a
superior
order
of
human
being
;
besides
,
there
be
no
princess
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
in
Jamaica
be
anxious
to
maintain
David
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
his
society
;
and
those
hide
merit
of
a
man
which
be
so
well
known
to
himself
be
as
little
recognize
there
as
they
notoriously
be
in
the
effete
society
of
the
Old
World
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
in
the
dark
hint
that
David
throw
out
at
the
Oyster
Club
about
that
life
of
Sultanic
self
-
indulgence
spend
by
him
in
the
luxurious
Indies
,
I
really
think
he
be
do
himself
a
wrong
;
I
believe
he
work
for
his
bread
,
and
,
in
fact
,
take
to
cooking
as
,
after
all
,
the
only
department
in
which
he
could
offer
skilled
labour
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
form
several
ingenious
plan
by
which
he
mean
to
circumvent
people
of
large
fortune
and
small
faculty
;
but
then
he
never
meet
with
exactly
the
right
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
David
's
device
for
get
rich
without
work
have
apparently
no
direct
relation
with
the
world
outside
him
,
as
his
confectionery
receipt
have
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
possible
to
pass
a
great
many
bad
half
penny
and
bad
half
-
crown
,
but
I
believe
there
have
no
instance
be
know
of
pass
a
halfpenny
or
a
half
-
crown
as
a
sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
a
sharper
can
drive
a
brisk
trade
in
this
world
:
it
be
undeniable
that
there
may
be
a
fine
career
for
him
,
if
he
will
dare
consequence
;
but
David
be
too
timid
to
be
a
sharp
,
or
venture
in
any
way
among
the
mantrap
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
He
dare
rob
nobody
but
his
mother
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
have
to
fall
back
on
the
genuine
value
<EOS>
there
be
in
him
 
to
be
content
to
pass
as
a
good
halfpenny
,
or
,
to
speak
more
accurately
,
as
a
good
confectioner
.
 
<EOS>
for
in
spite
of
some
additional
reading
and
observation
,
there
be
nothing
else
he
could
make
so
much
money
by
;
nay
,
he
find
in
himself
even
a
capability
of
extend
his
skill
in
this
direction
,
and
embrace
all
form
of
cookery
;
while
,
in
other
branch
of
human
labour
,
he
begin
to
see
that
it
be
not
possible
for
him
to
shine
.
 
<EOS>
Fate
be
too
strong
for
him
;
he
have
think
to
master
her
inclination
and
have
flee
over
the
sea
to
that
end
;
but
she
catch
him
,
tie
an
apron
round
him
,
and
snatch
him
from
all
other
device
,
make
him
devise
cake
and
patty
in
a
kitchen
at
Kingstown
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
get
submissive
to
her
,
since
she
pay
him
with
tolerable
gain
;
but
fever
and
prickly
heat
,
and
other
evil
incidental
to
cook
in
ardent
climate
,
make
him
long
for
his
native
land
;
so
he
take
ship
once
more
,
carry
his
six
year
'
saving
,
and
see
distinctly
,
this
time
,
what
be
Fate
's
intention
as
to
his
career
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
question
me
closely
as
to
whether
all
the
money
with
which
he
set
up
at
Grimworth
consist
of
pure
and
simple
earning
,
I
be
oblige
to
confess
that
he
get
a
sum
or
two
for
charitably
abstain
from
mention
some
other
people
's
misdemeanour
.
<EOS>
altogether
,
since
no
prospect
be
attach
to
his
family
name
,
and
since
a
new
christening
seem
a
suitable
commencement
of
a
new
life
,
Mr.
David
Faux
think
it
as
well
to
call
himself
Mr.
Edward
Freely
.
  
<EOS>
but
lo
!
<EOS>
now
,
in
opposition
to
all
calculable
probability
,
some
benefit
appear
to
be
attach
to
the
name
of
David
Faux
.
 
<EOS>
Should
he
neglect
it
,
as
beneath
the
attention
of
a
prosperous
tradesman
?
 
<EOS>
It
may
bring
him
into
contact
with
his
family
again
,
and
he
feel
no
yearning
in
that
direction
:
moreover
,
he
have
small
belief
that
the
"
something
to
his
advantage
"
could
be
anything
considerable
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
even
a
small
gain
be
pleasant
,
and
the
promise
of
it
in
this
instance
be
so
surprising
,
that
David
feel
his
curiosity
awaken
.
 
<EOS>
the
scale
dip
at
last
on
the
side
of
write
to
the
lawyer
,
and
,
to
be
brief
,
the
correspondence
end
in
an
appointment
for
a
meeting
between
David
and
his
eld
brother
at
Mr.
Strutt
's
,
the
vague
"
something
"
have
be
define
as
a
legacy
from
his
father
of
eighty
-
two
pound
,
three
shilling
.
  
<EOS>
David
,
you
know
,
have
expect
to
be
disinherit
;
and
so
he
would
have
be
,
if
he
have
not
,
like
some
other
indifferent
son
,
come
of
excellent
parent
,
whose
conscience
make
them
scrupulous
where
much
more
highly
-
instruct
people
often
feel
themselves
warrant
in
follow
the
bent
of
their
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
Good
Mrs.
Faux
could
never
forget
that
she
have
bring
this
ill
-
condition
son
into
the
world
when
he
be
in
that
entirely
helpless
state
which
exclude
the
small
choice
on
his
part
;
and
,
somehow
or
other
<EOS>
,
she
feel
that
his
go
wrong
would
be
his
father
's
and
mother
's
fault
,
if
they
fail
in
one
tittle
of
their
parental
duty
.
 
<EOS>
Her
notion
of
parental
duty
be
not
of
a
high
and
subtle
kind
,
but
it
include
give
him
his
due
share
of
the
family
property
;
for
when
a
man
have
get
a
little
honest
money
of
his
own
,
be
he
so
likely
to
steal
?
 
<EOS>
to
cut
the
delinquent
son
off
with
a
shilling
,
be
like
deliver
him
over
to
his
evil
propensity
.
 
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
let
the
sum
of
twenty
guinea
which
he
have
steal
be
deduct
from
his
share
,
and
then
let
the
sum
of
three
guinea
be
put
back
from
it
,
see
that
his
mother
have
always
consider
three
of
the
twenty
guinea
as
his
;
and
,
though
he
have
run
away
,
and
be
,
perhaps
,
go
across
the
sea
,
let
the
money
be
leave
to
him
all
the
same
,
and
be
keep
in
reserve
for
his
possible
return
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Faux
agree
to
his
wife
's
view
,
and
make
a
codicil
to
his
will
accordingly
,
in
time
to
die
with
a
clear
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
some
time
his
family
think
it
likely
that
David
would
never
reappear
;
and
the
eld
son
,
who
have
the
charge
of
Jacob
on
his
hand
,
often
think
it
a
little
hard
that
David
may
perhaps
be
dead
,
and
yet
,
for
want
of
certitude
on
that
point
,
his
legacy
could
not
fall
to
his
legal
heir
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
this
state
of
thing
the
opposite
certitude
 
namely
,
that
David
be
still
alive
and
<EOS>
in
England
 
seem
to
be
bring
by
the
testimony
of
a
neighbour
,
who
,
have
be
on
a
journey
to
Cattelton
,
be
pretty
sure
he
have
see
David
in
a
gig
,
with
a
stout
man
drive
by
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
"
swear
it
be
David
,
"
though
he
could
"
give
no
account
why
,
for
he
have
no
mark
on
him
;
but
no
more
have
a
white
dog
,
and
that
do
not
hinder
folk
from
know
a
white
dog
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
this
incident
which
have
lead
to
the
advertisement
.
  
<EOS>
the
legacy
be
pay
,
of
course
,
after
a
few
preliminary
disclosure
as
to
Mr.
David
's
actual
position
.
 
<EOS>
He
beg
to
send
his
love
to
his
mother
,
and
to
say
that
he
hope
to
pay
her
a
dutiful
visit
by
and
by
;
but
,
at
present
,
his
business
and
near
prospect
of
marriage
make
it
difficult
for
him
to
leave
home
.
 
<EOS>
His
brother
reply
with
much
frankness
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
may
do
as
she
like
about
have
you
to
see
her
,
but
,
for
my
part
,
I
do
not
want
to
catch
sight
of
you
on
the
premise
again
.
 
<EOS>
when
folk
have
take
a
new
name
,

during

he
see
that

I

Mr.

convey
to
Gilsbrook
without

He
see
clearly
that
if
he
take
Jacob
himself

his
absence

conjoin
with
the
disappearance
of
the
stranger
,
would
either
cause
the
conviction
that
he
be
really
a
relative

would
oblige
him
to
the
dangerous
course

invent

It
would

perhaps
,
have
be
a
longer

head
device

if
he
have
never
tell
any
of
those
clever
fib
about
his
uncle

grand

for
the
Palfreys
be
simple
people

share
the

even
if

what

He
rise

and
take
all
gentle
mean
to
rouse
this
fatal
brother
from
his
deep
sleep

dare
not

because
his

He

<EOS>
all
Grimworth
by
this
time
have
hear
how
Freely
have
be
fasten
on
by
an
idiot
,
who
call
him
"
Brother
Zavy
"
;
and
the
young
population
seem
to
find
the
singular
stranger
an
unwearying
source
of
fascination
,
while
the
householder
drop
in
one
by
one
to
inquire
into
the
incident
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
send
him
to
the
workhouse
?
"
say
Mr.
Prettyman

<EOS>
"
You
will
have
a
row
with
him
and
the
child
presently

and
he
will
eat
you
up

the

any

"
those
may
be
your
feeling

Mr.

"
say
David

his
mind
quite
enfeeble
by
the
torture
of
his
position

"
what

be
he
your
brother
,
then
?
"

Mr.

look
at
his

freely
rather
sharply

"
all

Mr.

who

<EOS>
Mr.
Palfrey

present
,
and
also

his

<EOS>
It
be
difficult
for
a
man
to
believe
in
the
advantage
of
a
truth
which
will
disclose
him
to
have
be
a
liar

in
this
critical
moment

David
shrink
from

immediate
disgrace
in

"
Mr.

I

I

"
say
Mr.

,
feel
that
it
be
an
occasion
on
which
format
language
must
be
use
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
own
him
,
"
say
Jonathan
,
unable
to
resist
a
movement
of
indignation
that
have
never
be
allow
to
satisfy
itself
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
run
away
from
home
with
good
reason
in
his
pocket
year
ago
:
he
do
not
want
to
be
own
again
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palfrey
leave
the
shop
;
he
feel
his
own
pride
too
severely
wound
by
the
sense
that
he
have
let
himself
be
fool
,
to
feel
curiosity
for
further
detail
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
pressing
business
be
to
go
home
and
tell
his
daughter
that
Freely
be
a
poor
sneak
,
probably
a
rascal
,
and
that
her
engagement
be
break
off
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Prettyman
stay
,
with
some
internal
self
-
gratulation
that
he
have
never
give
in
to
Freely
,
and
that
Mr.
Chaloner
would
see
now
what
sort
of
fellow
<EOS>
it
be
that
he
have
put
over
the
head
of
old
parishioner
.
 
<EOS>
He
consider
it
due
from
him
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Prettyman
)
<EOS>
that
,
for
the
interest
of
the
parish
,
he
should
know
all
that
be
to
be
know
about
this
"
interloper
.
<EOS>
"
Grimworth
would
have
people
come
from
Botany
Bay
to
settle
in
it
,
if
thing
go
on
in
this
way
.
  
<EOS>
It
soon
appear
that
Jacob
could
not
be
make
to
quit
his
dear
brother
David
except
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
He
understand
,
with
a
clearness
equal
to
that
of
the
most
intelligent
mind
,
that
Jonathan
would
take
him
back
to
skimmed
milk
,
apple
-
dumple
,
broad
bean
,
and
pork
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
have
find
a
paradise
in
his
brother
's
shop
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
difficult
matter
to
use
force
with
Jacob
,
for
he
wear
heavy
nail
boot
;
and
if
his
pitchfork
have
be
master
,
he
would
have
resort
without
hesitation
to
kick
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
short
of
use
guile
to
bind
him
hand
and
foot
would
have
make
all
party
safe
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
him
stay
,
"
say
David
,
with
desperate
resignation
,
frighten
above
all
thing
at
the
idea
of
further
disturbance
in
his
shop
,
which
would
make
his
exposure
all
the
more
conspicuous
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
go
away
again
,
and
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
can
,
perhaps
,
get
him
to
go
to
Gilsbrook
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
follow
me
fast
enough
<EOS>
,
I
daresay
,
"
he
add
,
with
a
half
-
groan
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
Jonathan
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
why
you
should
not
have
some
trouble
and
expense
with
him
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
but
mind
you
bring
him
back
safe
and
soon
,
else
<EOS>
mother'll
never
rest
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
this
arrangement
be
conclude
,
Mr.
Prettyman
beg
Mr.
Jonathan
Faux
to
go
and
take
a
snack
with
him
,
an
invitation
which
be
quite
acceptable
;
and
as
honest
Jonathan
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
<EOS>
,
it
be
probable
that
he
be
very
frank
in
his
communication
to
the
civil
draper
,
who
,
pursue
the
benefit
of
the
parish
,
hasten
to
make
all
the
information
he
could
gather
about
freely
common
parochial
property
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
that
the
meeting
of
the
Club
at
the
Woolpack
that
evening
be
unusually
lively
.
 
<EOS>
every
member
be
anxious
to
prove
that
he
have
never
like
Freely
,
as
he
call
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Faux
be
his
name
,
be
it
?
 
<EOS>
Fox
would
have
be
more
suitable
.
 
<EOS>
the
majority
express
a
desire
to
see
him
hoot
out
of
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Freely
do
not
venture
over
his
door
-
sill
that
day
,
for
he
know
Jacob
would
keep
at
his
side
,
and
there
be
every
probability
that
they
would
have
a
train
of
juvenile
follower
.
 
<EOS>
He
send
to
engage
the
Woolpack
gig
for
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
;
but
this
order
be
not
keep
religiously
a
secret
by
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Freely
be
inform
that
he
could
not
have
the
gig
till
seven
;
and
the
Grimworth
people
be
early
riser
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
they
be
more
alert
than
usual
on
this
particular
morning
;
for
when
Jacob
,
with
a
bag
of
sweet
in
his
hand
,
be
induce
to
mount
the
gig
with
his
brother
David
,
the
inhabitant
of
the
market
-
place
be
look
out
of
their
door
and
window
,
and
at
the
turning
of
the
street
there
be
even
a
muster
of
apprentice
and
schoolboy
,
who
shout
as
they
pass
in
what
Jacob
take
to
be
a
very
merry
and
friendly
way
,
nodding
and
grin
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
Huzzay
,
David
Faux
!
<EOS>
how
be
your
uncle
?
"
be
their
morning
's
greeting
.
 
<EOS>
like
other
pointed
thing
,
it
be
not
altogether
impromptu
.
  
<EOS>
even
this
public
derision
be
not
so
crush
to
David
as
the
horrible
thought
that
though
he
may
succeed
now
in
get
Jacob
home
again
there
would
never
be
any
security
against
his
come
back
,
like
a
wasp
to
the
honey
-
pot
.
 
<EOS>
as
long
as
David
live
at
Grimworth
,
Jacob
's
return
would
be
hang
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
could
he
go
on
live
at
Grimworth
 
<EOS>
an
object
of
ridicule
,
discard
by
the
Palfreys
,
after
have
revel
in
the
consciousness
that
he
be
an
envied
and
prosperous
confectioner
?
 
<EOS>
David
like
to
be
envy
;
he
mind
less
about
be
love
.
  
<EOS>
His
doubt
on
this
point
be
soon
settle
.
 
<EOS>
the
mind
of
Grimworth
become
obstinately
set
against
him
and
his
viand
,
and
the
new
school
be
finish
,
the
eat
-
room
be
close
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
have
be
no
other
reason
,
sympathy
with
the
Palfreys
,
that
respectable
family
who
have
live
in
the
parish
time
out
of
mind
,
would
have
determine
all
well
-
to
-
do
people
to
decline
Freely
's
good
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
he
have
abscond
with
his
mother
's
guinea
:
who
know
what
else
he
have
do
,
in
Jamaica
or
elsewhere
,
before
he
come
to
Grimworth
,
worm
himself
into
family
under
false
pretence
?
 
<EOS>
Females
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
dreadful
suspicion
gather
round
him
:
his
green
eye
,
his
bow
-
leg
have
a
criminal
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
the
rector
dislike
the
sight
of
a
man
who
have
impose
upon
him
;
and
all
boy
who
could
not
afford
to
purchase
,
hoot
"
David
Faux
"
as
they
pass
his
shop
.
<EOS>
certainly
no
man
now
would
pay
anything
for
the
"
goodwill
"
of
Mr.
Freely
's
business
,
and
he
would
be
oblige
to
quit
it
without
a
peculium
so
desirable
towards
defray
the
expense
of
move
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
month
the
shop
in
the
market
-
place
be
again
to
let
,
and
Mr.
David
Faux
,
alias
Mr.
Edward
Freely
,
have
go
 
<EOS>
nobody
at
Grimworth
know
whither
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
way
the
demoralization
of
Grimworth
woman
be
check
.
<EOS>
young
Mrs.
Steene
renew
her
effort
to
make
light
mince
-
pie
,
and
have
at
last
make
a
batch
so
excellent
that
Mr.
Steene
look
at
her
with
complacency
as
he
eat
them
,
and
say
they
be
the
good
he
have
ever
eat
in
his
life
,
she
think
less
of
bulbul
and
renegade
ever
after
.
<EOS>
the
secret
of
the
fine
cookery
be
revive
in
the
breast
of
matronly
house
-
wife
,
and
daughter
be
again
anxious
to
be
initiate
in
them

<EOS>
You
will
further
,
I
hope
,
be
glad
to
bear
,
that
some
purchase
of
drapery
make
by
pretty
Penny
,
in
preparation
for
her
marriage
with
Mr.
Freely
,
come
in
quite
as
well
for
her
wedding
with
young
tower
as
if
they
have
be
make
expressly
for
the
latter
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
for
Penny
's
complexion
have
not
alter

and
blue
always
become
it
best

<EOS>
here
end
the
story
of
Mr.
David
Faux
,
confectioner
,
and
his
brother
Jacob
.
 
<EOS>
and
we
see
in
it
,
I
think
,
an
admirable
instance
of
the
unexpected
form
in
which
the
great
nemesis
hide
