the
family
of
Dashwood
have
long
be
settle
in
Sussex
.
<EOS>
Their
estate
be
large
,
and
their
residence
be
at
Norland
Park
,
in
the
centre
of
their
property
,
where
,
for
many
generation
,
they
have
live
in
so
respectable
a
manner
as
to
engage
the
general
good
opinion
of
their
surround
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
the
late
owner
of
this
estate
be
a
single
man
,
who
live
to
a
very
advanced
age
,
and
who
for
many
year
of
his
life
,
have
a
constant
companion
and
housekeeper
in
his
sister
.
<EOS>
but
her
death
,
which
happen
ten
year
before
his
own
,
produce
a
great
alteration
in
his
home
;
for
to
supply
her
loss
,
he
invite
and
receive
into
his
house
the
family
of
his
nephew
Mr.
Henry
Dashwood
,
the
legal
inheritor
of
the
Norland
estate
,
and
the
person
to
whom
he
intend
to
bequeath
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
society
of
his
nephew
and
niece
,
and
their
child
,
the
old
Gentleman
's
day
be
comfortably
spend
.
<EOS>
His
attachment
to
them
all
increase
.
<EOS>
the
constant
attention
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Henry
Dashwood
to
his
wish
,
which
proceed
not
merely
from
interest
,
but
from
goodness
of
heart
,
give
him
every
degree
of
solid
comfort
which
his
age
could
receive
;
and
the
cheerfulness
of
the
child
add
a
relish
to
his
existence
.
  
<EOS>
by
a
former
marriage
,
Mr.
Henry
Dashwood
have
one
son
:
by
his
present
lady
,
three
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
son
,
a
steady
respectable
young
man
,
be
amply
provide
for
by
the
fortune
of
his
mother
,
which
have
be
large
,
and
half
of
which
devolve
on
him
on
his
coming
of
age
.
<EOS>
by
his
own
marriage
,
likewise
,
which
happen
soon
afterwards
,
he
add
to
his
wealth
.
<EOS>
to
him
therefore
the
succession
to
the
Norland
estate
be
not
so
really
important
as
to
his
sister
;
for
their
fortune
,
independent
of
what
may
arise
to
them
from
their
father
's
inherit
that
property
,
could
be
but
small
.
<EOS>
Their
mother
have
nothing
,
and
their
father
only
seven
thousand
pound
in
his
own
disposal
;
for
the
remain
moiety
of
his
first
wife
's
fortune
be
also
secure
to
her
child
,
and
he
have
only
a
life
-
interest
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
die
:
his
will
be
read
,
and
like
almost
every
other
will
,
give
as
much
disappointment
as
pleasure
.
<EOS>
He
be
neither
so
unjust
,
nor
so
ungrateful
,
as
to
leave
his
estate
from
his
nephew
;
but
he
leave
it
to
him
on
such
term
as
destroy
half
the
value
of
the
bequest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dashwood
have
wish
for
it
more
for
the
sake
of
his
wife
and
daughter
than
for
himself
or
his
son
;
but
to
his
son
,
and
his
son
's
son
,
a
child
of
four
year
old
,
it
be
secure
,
in
such
a
way
,
as
to
leave
to
himself
no
power
of
provide
for
those
who
be
most
dear
to
him
,
and
who
most
need
a
provision
by
any
charge
on
the
estate
,
or
by
any
sale
of
its
valuable
wood
.
<EOS>
the
whole
be
tie
up
for
the
benefit
of
this
child
,
who
,
in
occasional
visit
with
his
father
and
mother
at
Norland
,
have
so
far
gain
on
the
affection
of
his
uncle
,
by
such
attraction
as
be
by
no
mean
unusual
in
child
of
two
or
three
year
old
;
an
imperfect
articulation
,
an
earnest
desire
of
have
his
own
way
,
<EOS>
many
cunning
trick
,
and
a
great
deal
of
noise
,
as
to
outweigh
all
the
value
of
all
the
attention
which
,
for
year
,
he
have
receive
from
his
niece
and
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
mean
not
to
be
unkind
,
however
,
and
,
as
a
mark
of
his
affection
for
the
three
girl
,
he
leave
them
a
thousand
pound
a
-
piece
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dashwood
's
disappointment
be
,
at
first
,
severe
;
but
his
temper
be
cheerful
and
sanguine
;
and
he
may
reasonably
hope
to
live
many
year
,
and
by
live
economically
,
lie
by
a
considerable
sum
from
the
produce
of
an
estate
already
large
,
and
capable
of
almost
immediate
improvement
.
<EOS>
but
the
fortune
,
which
have
be
so
tardy
in
come
,
be
his
only
one
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
He
survive
his
uncle
no
longer
;
and
ten
thousand
pound
,
include
the
late
legacy
,
be
all
that
remain
for
his
widow
and
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
His
son
be
send
for
as
soon
as
his
danger
be
know
,
and
to
him
Mr.
Dashwood
recommend
,
with
all
the
strength
and
urgency
which
illness
could
command
,
the
interest
of
his
mother
-
in

law
and
sister
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Dashwood
have
not
the
strong
feeling
of
the
rest
of
the
family
;
but
he
be
affect
by
a
recommendation
of
such
a
nature
at
such
a
time
,
and
he
promise
to
do
every
thing
in
his
power
to
make
them
comfortable
.
<EOS>
His
father
be
render
easy
by
such
an
assurance
,
and
Mr.
John
Dashwood
have
then
leisure
to
consider
how
much
there
may
prudently
be
in
his
power
to
do
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
an
ill
-
dispose
young
man
,
unless
to
be
rather
cold
hearted
and
rather
selfish
be
to
be
ill
-
dispose
:
but
he
be
,
in
general
,
well
respected
;
for
he
conduct
himself
with
propriety
in
the
discharge
of
his
ordinary
duty
.
<EOS>
have
he
marry
a
more
amiable
woman
,
he
may
have
be
make
still
more
respectable
than
he
be
:
he
may
even
have
be
make
amiable
himself
;
for
he
be
very
young
when
he
marry
,
and
very
fond
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
be
a
strong
caricature
of
himself
;
more
narrow
-
minded
and
selfish
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
give
his
promise
to
his
father
,
he
meditate
within
himself
to
increase
the
fortune
of
his
sister
by
the
present
of
a
thousand
pound
a
-
piece
.
<EOS>
He
then
really
think
himself
equal
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
four
thousand
a
-
year
,
in
addition
to
his
present
income
,
besides
the
remain
half
of
his
own
mother
's
fortune
,
warm
his
heart
,
and
make
him
feel
capable
of
generosity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
he
would
give
them
three
thousand
pound
:
it
would
be
liberal
and
handsome
!
<EOS>
It
would
be
enough
to
make
them
completely
easy
.
<EOS>
three
thousand
pound
!
<EOS>
he
could
spare
so
considerable
a
sum
with
little
inconvenience
.
"
<EOS>
He
think
of
it
all
day
long
,
and
for
many
day
successively
,
and
he
do
not
repent
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
his
father
's
funeral
over
,
than
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
,
without
send
any
notice
of
her
intention
to
her
mother
-
in
-
law
,
arrive
with
her
child
and
their
attendant
.
<EOS>
no
one
could
dispute
her
right
to
come
;
the
house
be
her
husband
's
from
the
moment
of
his
father
's
decease
;
but
the
indelicacy
of
her
conduct
be
so
much
the
great
,
and
to
a
woman
in
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
situation
,
with
only
common
feeling
,
must
have
be
highly
unpleasing
.
<EOS>
but
in
_
her
_
mind
there
be
a
sense
of
honor
so
keen
,
a
generosity
so
romantic
,
that
any
offence
of
the
kind
,
by
whomsoever
give
or
receive
,
be
to
her
a
source
of
immovable
disgust
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
have
never
be
a
favourite
with
any
of
her
husband
's
family
;
but
she
have
have
no
opportunity
,
till
the
present
,
of
show
them
with
how
little
attention
to
the
comfort
of
other
people
she
could
act
when
occasion
require
it
.
  
<EOS>
so
acutely
do
Mrs.
Dashwood
feel
this
ungracious
behaviour
,
and
so
earnestly
do
she
despise
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
for
it
,
that
,
on
the
arrival
of
the
latter
,
she
would
have
quit
the
house
for
ever
,
have
not
the
entreaty
of
her
eld
girl
induce
her
first
to
reflect
on
the
propriety
of
go
,
and
her
own
tender
love
for
all
her
three
child
determine
her
afterwards
to
stay
,
and
for
their
sake
avoid
a
breach
with
their
brother
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
,
this
eld
daughter
,
whose
advice
be
so
effectual
,
possess
a
strength
of
understanding
,
and
coolness
of
judgment
,
which
qualify
her
,
though
only
nineteen
,
to
be
the
counsellor
of
her
mother
,
and
enable
her
frequently
to
counteract
,
to
the
advantage
of
them
all
,
that
eagerness
of
mind
in
Mrs.
Dashwood
which
must
generally
have
lead
to
imprudence
.
<EOS>
She
have
an
excellent
heart
;
her
disposition
be
affectionate
,
and
her
feeling
be
strong
;
but
she
know
how
to
govern
them
:
it
be
a
knowledge
which
her
mother
have
yet
to
learn
;
and
which
one
of
her
sister
have
resolve
never
to
be
teach
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
's
ability
be
,
in
many
respect
,
quite
equal
to
Elinor
's
.
<EOS>
She
be
sensible
and
clever
;
but
eager
in
everything
:
her
sorrow
,
her
joy
,
could
have
no
moderation
.
<EOS>
She
be
generous
,
amiable
,
interesting
:
she
be
everything
but
prudent
.
<EOS>
the
resemblance
between
her
and
her
mother
be
strikingly
great
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
see
,
with
concern
,
the
excess
of
her
sister
's
sensibility
;
but
by
Mrs.
Dashwood
it
be
value
and
cherish
.
<EOS>
They
encourage
each
other
now
in
the
violence
of
their
affliction
.
<EOS>

agony
of
grief
which
overpower
them
at
first

be
voluntarily

,
be

for
,
be
create
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
They
give
themselves
up
wholly
to
their
sorrow
,
seek
increase
of
wretchedness
in
every
reflection
that
could
afford
it
,
and
resolve
against
ever
admit
consolation
in
future
.
<EOS>
Elinor
,
too
,
be
deeply
afflict
;
but
still
she
could
struggle
,
she
could
exert
herself
.
<EOS>
She
could
consult
with
her
brother
,
could
receive
her
sister
-
in
-
law
on
her
arrival
,
and
treat
her
with
proper
attention
;
and
could
strive
to
rouse
her
mother
to
similar
exertion
,
and
encourage
her
to
similar
forbearance
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
,
the
other
sister
,
be
a
good
-
humored
,
well
-
dispose
girl
;
but
as
she
have
already
imbibe
a
good
deal
of
Marianne
's
romance
,
without
have
much
of
her
sense
,
she
do
not
,
at
thirteen
,
bid
fair
to
equal
her
sister
at
a
more
advanced
period
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
now
instal
herself
mistress
of
Norland
;
and
her
mother
and
sister
-
in

law
be
degrade
to
the
condition
of
visitor
.
<EOS>
as
such
,
however
,
they
be
treat
by
her
with
quiet
civility
;
and
by
her
husband
with
as
much
kindness
as
he
could
feel
towards
anybody
beyond
himself
,
his
wife
,
and
their
child
.
<EOS>
He
really
press
them
,
with
some
earnestness
,
to
consider
Norland
as
their
home
;
and
,
as
no
plan
appear
so
eligible
to
Mrs.
Dashwood
as
remain
there
till
she
could
accommodate
herself
with
a
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
his
invitation
be
accept
.
  
<EOS>
a
continuance
in
a
place
where
everything
remind
her
of
former
delight
,
be
exactly
what
suit
her
mind
.
<EOS>
in
season
of
cheerfulness
,
no
temper
could
be
more
cheerful
than
her
,
or
possess
,
in
a
great
degree
,
that
sanguine
expectation
of
happiness
which
be
happiness
itself
.
<EOS>
but
in
sorrow
she
must
be
equally
carry
away
by
her
fancy
,
and
as
far
beyond
consolation
as
in
pleasure
<EOS>
she
be
beyond
alloy
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
do
not
at
all
approve
of
what
her
husband
intend
to
do
for
his
sister
.
<EOS>
to
take
three
thousand
pound
from
the
fortune
of
their
dear
little
boy
would
be
impoverish
him
to
the
most
dreadful
degree
.
<EOS>
She
beg
him
to
think
again
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
answer
it
to
himself
to
rob
his
child
,
and
his
only
child
too
,
of
so
large
a
sum
?
<EOS>
and
what
possible
claim
could
the
Miss
Dashwoods
,
who
be
relate
to
him
only
by
half
blood
,
which
she
consider
as
no
relationship
at
all
,
have
on
his
generosity
to
so
large
an
amount
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
well
known
that
no
affection
be
ever
suppose
to
exist
between
the
child
of
any
man
by
different
marriage
;
and
why
be
he
to
ruin
himself
,
and
their
poor
little
Harry
,
by
give
away
all
his
money
to
his
half
sister
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
my

last
request

reply
her

He

I
dare

he
be
light

head
at

<EOS>
have
he
be
in
his
right

he
could
not

think
of
such
a

as
beg
you
to
give
away
half
your
fortune
from
your
own
child

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
stipulate
for
any
particular
sum
,
my
dear
Fanny
;
he
only
request
me
,
in
general
term
,
to
assist
them
,
and
make
their
situation
more
comfortable
than
it
be
in
his
power
to
do

<EOS>
perhaps
it
would
have
be
as
well
if
he
have
leave
it
wholly
to
myself
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
suppose
I
should
neglect
them
.
<EOS>
but
as
he
require
the
promise
,
I
could
not
do
less
than
give
it
;
at
least
I
think
so
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
the
promise
,
therefore
,
be
give
,
and
must
be
perform
.
<EOS>
something
must
be
do
for
them
whenever
they
leave
Norland
and
settle
in
a
new
home

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then

let

something
be
do
for

_
<EOS>
that

not

three
thousand

<EOS>
consider
,
"
she
add
,
"
that
when
the
money
be
once
part

it
never

<EOS>
Your
sister
will
marry
,
and
it
will
be
go
for
ever

<EOS>
if
,
indeed
,
it
could
be
restore

why

say
her

very
gravely

that
would

great

<EOS>
the
time
may
come
when
Harry
will
regret

with

I
do

"
<EOS>
fifteen

<EOS>
my

Fanny
;
her
life
can
not

worth
half
that
purchase

<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
not
;
but
if
you
observe
,
people
always
live
for
ever
when
there
be
an
annuity
to
be
pay
them
;
and
she
be
very
stout
and
healthy
,
and
hardly
forty
.
<EOS>
an
annuity
be
a
very
serious
business
;
it
come
over
and
over
every
year
,
and
there
be
no
get
rid
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
aware
of
what
you
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
great
deal
of
the
trouble
of
annuity
;
for
my
mother
be
clog
with
the
payment
of
three
to
old
superannuated
servant
by
my
father
's
will
,
and
it
be
amazing
how
disagreeable
she
find
it
.
<EOS>
twice
every
year
these
annuity
be
to
be
pay
;
and
then
there
be
the
trouble
of
get
it
to
them
;
and
then
one
of
them
be
say
to
have
die
,
and
afterwards
it
turn
out
to
be
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
My
mother
be
quite
sick
of
it
.
<EOS>
Her
income
be
not
her
own
,
she
say
,
with
such
perpetual
claim
on
it
;
and
it
be
the
more
unkind
in
my
father
,
because
,
otherwise
,
the
money
would
have
be
entirely
at
my
mother
's
disposal
,
without
any
restriction
whatever
.
<EOS>
It
have
give
me
such
an
abhorrence
of
annuity
,
that
I
be
sure
I
would
not
pin
myself
down
to
the
payment
of
one
for
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
certainly
an
unpleasant
thing
,
"
reply
Mr.
Dashwood
,
"
to
have
those

tie
down
to

regular
payment
of

a
sum

be
by
no

desirable
:
it
take
away
one

independence

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
undoubtedly
;
and
after
all
you
have
no
thank
for
it
.
<EOS>
They
think
themselves
secure
,
you
do
no
more
than
what
be
expect
,
and
it
raise
no
gratitude
at
all
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
you
,
whatever
I
do
should
be
do
at
my
own
discretion
entirely
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
bind
myself
to
allow
them
any
thing
yearly
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
very
inconvenient
some
year
to
spare
a
hundred

even
fifty
pound
from
our
own
expense

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
be
right
,
my
love
;
it
will
be
well
that
there
should
be
no
annuity
in
the
case
;
whatever
I
may
give
them
occasionally
will
be
of
far
great
assistance
than
a
yearly
allowance
,
because
they
would
only
enlarge
their
style
of
live
if
they
feel
sure
of
a
large
income
,
and
would
not
be
sixpence
the
rich
for
it
at
the
end
of
the
year

<EOS>
It
will
certainly
be
much
the
good
way
.
<EOS>
a
present
of
fifty
pound
,
now
and
then
,
will
prevent
their
ever
be
distress
for
money
,
and
will
,
I
think
,
be
amply
discharge
my
promise
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
be
sure
it
will
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
be
convince
within
myself
that
your
father
have
no
idea
of
your
give
them
any
money
at
all
.
<EOS>
the
assistance
he
think
of
,
I
dare
say
,
be
only
such
as
may
be
reasonably
expect
of
you
;
for
instance
,
such
as
look
out
for
a
comfortable
small
house
for
them
,
help
them
to
move
their
thing
,
and
send
them
present
of
fish
and
game
,
and
so
forth
,
whenever
they
be
in
season
.
<EOS>
I
will
lay
my
life
that
he
mean
nothing
farther
;
indeed
,
it
would
be
very
strange
and
unreasonable
if
he
do
.
<EOS>
do
but
consider
,
my
dear
Mr.
Dashwood
,
how
excessively
comfortable
your
mother
-
in
-
law
and
her
daughter
may
live
on
the
interest
of
seven
thousand
pound
,
besides
the
thousand
pound
belong
to
each
of
the
girl
,
which
bring
them
in
fifty
pound
a
year
a
-
piece
,
and
,
of
course
,
they
will
pay
their
mother
for
their
board
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
altogether
,
they
will
have
five
hundred
a
-
year
amongst
them
,
and
what
on
earth
can
four
woman
want
for
more
than
that
?
 
<EOS>
They
will
live
so
cheap
!
<EOS>
Their
housekeeping
will
be
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
They
will
have
no
carriage
,
no
horse
,
and
hardly
any
servant
;
they
will
keep
no
company
,
and
can
have
no
expense
of
any
kind
!
<EOS>
only
conceive
how
comfortable
they
will
be
!
<EOS>
five
hundred
a
year
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
can
not
imagine
how
they
will
spend
half
of
it
;
and
as
to
your
give
them
more
,
it
be
quite
absurd
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
much
more
able
to
give
_
you
_
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
upon
my
word
,
"
say
Mr.
Dashwood
,
"
I
believe
you
be
perfectly
right
.
<EOS>
My
father
certainly
could
mean
nothing
more
by
his
request
to
me
than
what
you
say
.
<EOS>
I
clearly
understand
it
now
,
and
I
will
strictly
fulfil
my
engagement
by
such
act
of
assistance
and
kindness
to
them
as
you
have
describe
.
<EOS>
when
my
mother
remove
into
another
house
my
service
shall
be
readily
give
to
accommodate
her
as
far
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
some
little
present
of
furniture
too
may
be
acceptable
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
,
"
return
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
_
one
_
thing
must
be
consider
.
<EOS>
when
your
father
and
mother
move
to
Norland
,
though
the
furniture
of
Stanhill
be
sell
,
all
the
china
,
plate
,
and
linen
be
save
,
and
be
now
leave
to
your
mother
.
<EOS>
Her
house
will
therefore
be
almost
completely
fit
up
as
soon
as
she
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
material
consideration
undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
a
valuable
legacy
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
yet
some
of
the
plate
would
have
be
a
very
pleasant
addition
to
our
own
stock
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
the
set
of
breakfast
china
be
twice
as
handsome
as
what
belong
to
this
house
.
<EOS>
a
great
deal
too
handsome
,
in
my
opinion
,
for
any
place
<EOS>
_
they
_
can
ever
afford
to
live
in
.
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
Your
father
think
only
of
_
them
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
and
I
must
say
this
:
that
you
owe
no
particular
gratitude
to
him
,
nor
attention
to
his
wish
;
for
we
very
well
know
that
if
he
could
,
he
would
have
leave
almost
everything
in
the
world
to
_
them
.
<EOS>
_
"
  
<EOS>
this
argument
be
irresistible
.
<EOS>
It
give
to
his
intention
whatever
of
decision
be
want
before
;
and
he
finally
resolve
,
that
it
would
be
absolutely
unnecessary
,
if
not
highly
indecorous
,
to
do
more
for
the
widow
and
child
of
his
father
,
than
such
kind
of
neighbourly
act
as
his
own
wife
point
out
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
remain
at
Norland
several
month
;
not
from
any
disinclination
to
move
when
the
sight
of
every
well
know
spot
cease
to
raise
the
violent
emotion
which
it
produce
for
a
while
;
for
when
her
spirit
begin
to
revive
,
and
her
mind
become
capable
of
some
other
exertion
than
that
of
heighten
its
affliction
by
melancholy
remembrance
,
she
be
impatient
to
be
go
,
and
indefatigable
in
her
inquiry
for
a
suitable
dwelling
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Norland
;
for
to
remove
far
from
that
beloved
spot
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
hear
of
no
situation
that
at
once
answer
her
notion
of
comfort
and
ease
,
and
suit
the
prudence
of
her
eld
daughter
,
whose
steady
judgment
reject
several
house
as
too
large
for
their
income
,
which
her
mother
would
have
approve
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
have
be
inform
by
her
husband
of
the
solemn
promise
on
the
part
of
his
son
in
their
favour
,
which
give
comfort
to
his
last
earthly
reflection
.
<EOS>
She
doubt
the
sincerity
of
this
assurance
no
more
than
he
have
doubt
it
himself
,
and
she
think
of
it
for
her
daughter
'
sake
with
satisfaction
,
though
as
for
herself
she
be
persuade
that
a
much
small
provision
than
7000L
would
support
her
in
affluence
.
<EOS>
for
their
brother
's
sake
,
too
,
for
the
sake
of
his
own
heart

she
rejoice
;
and
she
reproach
herself
for
be
unjust
to
his
merit
before
,
in
believe
him
incapable
of
generosity
.
<EOS>
His
attentive
behaviour
to
herself
and
his
sister
convince
her
that
their
welfare
be
dear
to
him
,
and
,
for
a
long
time
,
she
firmly
rely
on
the
liberality
of
his
intention

<EOS>
the
contempt
which
she
have
,
very
early
in
their
acquaintance
,
feel
for
her
daughter
-
in

be
very
much
increase
by
the
farth
knowledge
of
her
character
,
which
half
a

's
residence
in
her
family
afford
;
and
perhaps
in
spite
of
every
consideration
of
politeness
or
maternal
affection
on
the
side
of
the
former
,
the
two
lady
may
have
find
it
impossible
to
have
live
together
so
long
,
<EOS>
have
not
a
particular
circumstance
occur
to
give
still
great
eligibility
,
accord
to
the
opinion
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
to
her
daughter
'
continuance
at
Norland

<EOS>
this
circumstance
be
a
grow
attachment
between
her

the
brother
of

a
gentlemanlike
and
pleasing
young
man
,
who

to
their
acquaintance
soon
after
his
sister
's
establishment
at
Norland
,
and
who
have
since
spend
the
great
part
of
his
time
there
.
  
<EOS>
some
mother
may
have
encourage
the
intimacy
from
motive
of
interest
,
for
Edward
Ferrars
be
the
eld
son
of
a
man
who
have
die
very
rich
;
and
some
may
have
repress
it
from
motive
of
prudence
,
for
,
except
a
trifling
sum
,
the
whole
of
his
fortune
depend
on
the
will
of
his
mother
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Dashwood
be
alike
uninfluenced
by
either
consideration
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
her
that
he
appear
to
be
amiable
,
that
he
love
her
daughter
,
and
that
Elinor
return
the
partiality
.
<EOS>
It
be
contrary
to
every
doctrine
of
her
be
that
difference
of
fortune
should
keep
any
couple
asunder
who
be
attract
by
resemblance
of
disposition
;
and
that
Elinor
's
merit
should
not
be
acknowledge
by
every
one
who
know
her
,
be
to
her
comprehension
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
Edward
Ferrars
be
not
recommend
to
their
good
opinion
by
any
peculiar
grace
of
person
or
address
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
handsome
,
and
his
manner
require
intimacy
to
make
them
pleasing
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
diffident
to
do
justice
to
himself
;
but
when
his
natural
shyness
be
overcome
,
his
behaviour
give
every
indication
of
an
open
,
affectionate
heart
.
<EOS>
His
understanding
be
good
,
and
his
education
have
give
it
solid
improvement
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
neither
fit
by
ability
nor
disposition
to
answer
the
wish
of
his
mother
and
sister
,
who
long
to
see
him
distinguish
as
 
they
hardly
know
what
.
<EOS>
They
want
him
to
make
a
fine
figure
in
the
world
in
some
manner
or
other
.
<EOS>
His
mother
wish
to
interest
him
in
political
concern
,
to
get
him
into
parliament
,
or
to
see
him
connect
with
some
of
the
great
man
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
wish
it
likewise
;
but
in
the
mean
while
,
till
one
of
these
superior
blessing
could
be
attain
,
it
would
have
quiet
her
ambition
to
see
him
drive
a
barouche
.
<EOS>
but
Edward
have
no
turn
for
great
man
or
barouche
.
<EOS>
all
his
wish
center
in
domestic
comfort
and
the
quiet
of
private
life

<EOS>
fortunately
he
have
a
young
brother
who

<EOS>
Edward
have
be
stay
several
week
in
the
house
before
he
engage
much
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
attention
;
for
she
be
,
at
that
time
,
in
such
affliction
as
render
her
careless
of
surround
object
.
<EOS>
She
see
only
that
he
be
quiet
and
unobtrusive
,
and
she
like
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
disturb
the
wretchedness
of
her
mind
by
ill
-
time
conversation
.
<EOS>
She
be
first
call
to
observe
and
approve
him
farther
,
by
a
reflection
which
Elinor
chance
one
day
to
make
on
the
difference
between
him
and
his
sister
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
contrast
which
recommend
him
most
forcibly
to
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
enough
,
"
say
she
;
"
to
say
that
he
be
unlike
Fanny
be
enough
.
<EOS>
It
imply
everything
amiable
.
<EOS>
I
love
him
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
will
like
him
,
"
say
Elinor
,
"
when
you
know
more
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
like
him
!
"
reply
her
mother
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
no
sentiment
of
approbation
inferior
to
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
esteem
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
yet
know
what
it
be
to
separate
esteem
and
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
now
take
pain
to
get
acquaint
with
him
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
attach
,
and
soon
banish
his
reserve
.
<EOS>
She
speedily
comprehend
all
his
merit
;
the
persuasion
of
his
regard
for
Elinor
perhaps
assist
her
penetration
;
but
she
really
feel
assure
of
his
worth
:
and
even
that
quietness
of
manner
,
which
militate
against
all
her
established
idea
of
what
a
young
man
's
address
ought
to
be
,
be
no
longer
uninteresting
when
she
know
his
heart
to
be
warm
and
his
temper
affectionate
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
she
perceive
any
symptom
of
love
in
his
behaviour
to
Elinor
,
than
she
consider
their
serious
attachment
as
certain
,
and
look
forward
to
their
marriage
as
rapidly
approach
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
a
few
month
,
my
dear
Marianne
,
"
say
she
,
"
Elinor
will
,
in
all
probability
be
settle
for
life

<EOS>
We
shall
miss
her
;
but
_
she
_
will
be
happy

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mamma
,
how
shall
we
do
without
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
it
will
be
scarcely
a
separation

<EOS>
We
shall
live
within
a
few
mile
of
each
other
,
and
shall
meet
every
day
of
our
life
.
<EOS>
You
will
gain
a
brother
 
a
real
,
affectionate
brother
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
high
opinion
in
the
world
of
Edward
's
heart
.
<EOS>
but
you
look
grave
,
Marianne
;
do
you
disapprove
your
sister
's
choice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
say
Marianne
,
"
I
may
consider
it
with
some
surprise
.
<EOS>
Edward
be
very
amiable
,
and
I
love
him
tenderly
.
<EOS>
but
yet
 
he
be
not
the
kind
of
young
man
;
there
be
something
want
 
his
figure
be
not
striking
;
it
have
none
of
that
grace
which
I
should
expect
in
the
man
who
could
seriously
attach
my
sister
.
<EOS>
His
eye
want
all
that
spirit
,
that
fire
,
which
at
once
announce
virtue
and
intelligence
.
<EOS>
and
besides
all
this
,
I
be
afraid
,
Mamma
,
he
have
no
real
taste
.
<EOS>
music
seem
scarcely
to
attract
him
,
and
though
he
admire
Elinor
's
drawing
very
much
,
it
be
not
the
admiration
of
a
person
who
can
understand
their
worth
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
,
in
spite
of
his
frequent
attention
to
her
while
she
draw
,
that
in
fact
he
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
admire
as
a
lover
,
not
as
a
connoisseur
.
<EOS>
to
satisfy
me
,
those
character
must
be
unite
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
happy
with
a
man
whose
taste
do
not
in
every
point
coincide
with
my
own
.
<EOS>
He
must
enter
into
all
my
feeling
;
the
same
book
,
the
same
music
must
charm
us
both
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
mama
,
how
spiritless
,
how
tame
be
Edward
's
manner
in
read
to
us
last
night
!
<EOS>
I
feel
for
my
sister
most
severely
.
<EOS>
yet
she
bear
it
with
so
much
composure
,
she
seem
scarcely
to
notice
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
keep
my
seat
.
<EOS>
to
hear
those
beautiful
line
which
have
frequently
almost
drive
me
wild
,
pronounce
with
such
impenetrable
calmness
,
such
dreadful
indifference
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
certainly
have
do
more
justice
to
simple
and
elegant
prose
.
<EOS>
I
think
so
at
the
time
;
but
you
_
would
_
give
him
Cowper
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
Mamma
,
if
he
be
not
to
be
animate
by
Cowper
!
 
<EOS>
but
we
must
allow
for
difference
of
taste
.
<EOS>
Elinor
have
not
my
feeling
,
and
therefore
she
may
overlook
it
,
and
be
happy
with
him
.
<EOS>
but
it
would
have
break
_
my
_
heart
,
have
I
love
him
,
to
hear
him
read
with
so
little
sensibility
.
<EOS>
Mama
,
the
more
I
know
of
the
world
,
the
more
am
<EOS>
I
convince
that
I
shall
never
see
a
man
whom
I
can
really
love
.
<EOS>
I
require
so
much
!
<EOS>
He
must
have
all
Edward
's
virtue
,
and
his
person
and
manner
must
ornament
his
goodness
with
every
possible
charm
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
remember
,
my
love
,
that
you
be
not
seventeen
.
<EOS>
It
be
yet
too
early
in
life
to
despair
of
such
a
happiness
.
<EOS>
why
should
you
be
less
fortunate
than
your
mother
?
<EOS>
in
one
circumstance
only
,
my
Marianne
,
may
your
destiny
be
different
from
her
's
!
"
    
<EOS>
"
what
a
pity
it
be
,
Elinor
,
"
say
Marianne
,
"
that
Edward
should
have
no
taste
for
drawing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
taste
for
drawing
!
"
<EOS>
reply
Elinor
,
"
<EOS>
why
should
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
He
do
not
draw
himself
,
indeed
,
but
he
have
great
pleasure
in
see
the
performance
of
other
people
,
and
I
assure
you
he
be
by
no
mean
deficient
in
natural
taste
,
though
he
have
not
have
opportunity
of
improve
it
.
<EOS>
have
he
ever
be
in
the
way
of
learning
,
I
think
he
would
have
draw
very
well
.
<EOS>
He
distrust
his
own
judgment
in
such
matter
so
much
,
that
he
be
always
unwilling
to
give
his
opinion
on
any
picture
;
but
he
have
an
innate
propriety
and
simplicity
of
taste
,
which
in
general
direct
him
perfectly
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
Marianne
be
afraid
of
offending
,
and
say
no
more
on
the
subject
;
but
the
kind
of
approbation
which
Elinor
describe
as
excited
in
him
by
the
drawing
of
other
people
,
be
very
far
from
that
rapturous
delight
,
which
,
in
her
opinion
,
could
alone
be
call
taste
.
<EOS>
yet
,
though
smile
within
herself
at
the
mistake
,
she
honour
her
sister
for
that
blind
partiality
to
Edward
which
produce
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Marianne
,
"
continue
Elinor
,
"
you
do
not
consider
him
as
deficient
in
general
taste

<EOS>
indeed
,
I
think
I
may
say
that
you
can
not
,
for
your
behaviour
to
him
be
perfectly
cordial
,
and
if
_
<EOS>
that
_
be
your
opinion
,
I
be
sure
you
could
never
be
civil
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Marianne
hardly
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
wound
the
feeling
of
her
sister
on
any
account
,
and
yet
to
say
what
she
do
not
believe
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
at
length
she
reply
:
  
"
do
not
be
offend
,
Elinor
,
if
my
praise
of
him
be
not
in
every
thing
equal
to
your
sense
of
his
merit
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
have
so
many
opportunity
of
estimate
the
minuter
propensity
of
his
mind
,
his
inclination
and
taste
,
as
you
have
;
but
I
have
the
high
opinion
in
the
world
of
his
goodness
and
sense
.
<EOS>
I
think
him
every
thing
that
be
worthy
and
amiable

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
"
reply
Elinor
,
with
a
smile
,
"
that
his
dear
friend
could
not
be
dissatisfy
with
such
commendation
as
that
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
perceive
how
you
could
express
yourself
more
warmly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Marianne
be
rejoice
to
find
her
sister
so
easily
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
his
sense
and
his
goodness
,
"
continue
Elinor
,
"
no
one
can
,
I
think
,
be
in
doubt
,
who
have
see
him
often
enough
to
engage
him
in
unreserved
conversation
.
<EOS>
the
excellence
of
his
understanding
and
his
principle
can
be
conceal
only
by
that
shyness
which
too
often
keep
him
silent
.
<EOS>
You
know
enough
of
him
to
do
justice
to
his
solid
worth
.
<EOS>
but
of
his
minuter
propensity
,
as
you
call
them
you
have
from
peculiar
circumstance
be
keep
more
ignorant
than
myself
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
have
be
at
time
throw
a
good
deal
together
,
while
you
have
be
wholly
engross
on
the
most
affectionate
principle
by
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
great
deal
of
him
,
have
study
his
sentiment
and
hear
his
opinion
on
subject
of
literature
and
taste
;
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
venture
to
pronounce
that
his
mind
be
well
-
inform
,
enjoyment
of
book
exceedingly
great
,
his
imagination
lively
,
his
observation
just
and
correct
,
and
his
taste
delicate
and
pure
.
<EOS>
His
ability
in
every
respect
improve
as
much
upon
acquaintance
as
his
manner
and
person
.
<EOS>
at
first
sight
,
his
address
be
certainly
not
strike
;
and
his
person
can
hardly
be
call
handsome
,
till
the
expression
of
his
eye
,
which
be
uncommonly
good
,
and
the
general
sweetness
of
his
countenance
,
be
perceive
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
I
know
him
so
well
,
that
I
think
him
really
handsome
;
or
at
least
,
almost
so
.
<EOS>
what
say
you
,
Marianne
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
very
soon
think
him
handsome
,
Elinor
,
if
I
do
not
now
.
<EOS>
when
you
tell
me
to
love
him
as
a
brother
,
I
shall
no
more
see
imperfection
in
his
face
,
than
I
now
do
in
his
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
start
at
this
declaration
,
and
be
sorry
for
the
warmth
she
have
be
betray
into
,
in
speak
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
Edward
stand
very
high
in
her
opinion
.
<EOS>
She
believe
the
regard
to
be
mutual
;
but
she
require
great
certainty
of
it
to
make
Marianne
's
conviction
of
their
attachment
agreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
what
Marianne
and
her
mother
conjecture
one
moment
,
they
believe
the
next
 
that
with
them
,
to
wish
be
to
hope
,
and
to
hope
be
to
expect
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
explain
the
real
state
of
the
case
to
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
attempt
to
deny
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
I
think
very
highly
of
him
 
that
I
greatly
esteem

that
I
like

<EOS>
Marianne
here
burst
forth
with
indignation
    
<EOS>
"
esteem
him

like
him
!
<EOS>
Cold
-
hearted
Elinor
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
bad
than
cold
-
hearted
!
<EOS>
ashamed
of
be
otherwise

<EOS>
use
those
word
again

and
I
will
leave
the
room
this
moment

"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
could
not
help
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
excuse
me
,
"
say
she
;
"
and
be
assure
that
I
mean
no
offence
to
you
,
by
speak
,
in
so
quiet
a
way
,
of
my
own
feeling
.
<EOS>
believe
them
to
be
strong
than
I
have
declare
;
believe
them
,
in
short
,
to
be
such
as
his
merit
,
and
the
suspicion
 
<EOS>
the
hope
 
of
his
affection
for
me
may
warrant
,
without
imprudence
or
folly
.
<EOS>
but
farther
than
this
you
must
not
believe
.
<EOS>
I
be
by
no
mean
assure
of
his
regard
for
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
moment
when
the
extent
of
it
seem
doubtful
;
and
till
his
sentiment
be
fully
know
,
you
can
not
wonder
at
my
wishing
to
avoid
any
encouragement
of
my
own
partiality
,
by
believe
or
call
it
more
than
it
be
.
<EOS>
in
my
heart
I
feel
little
 
scarcely
any
doubt
of
his
preference
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
other
point
to
be
consider
besides
his
inclination
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
far
from
be
independent
.
<EOS>
what
his
mother
really
be
we
can
not
know
;
but
,
from
Fanny
's
occasional
mention
of
her
conduct
and
opinion
,
we
have
never
be
dispose
to
think
her
amiable
;
and
I
be
very
much
mistake
if
Edward
be
not
himself
aware
that
there
would
be
many
difficulty
in
his
way
,
if
he
be
to
wish
to
marry
a
woman
who
have
not
either
a
great
fortune
or
high
rank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Marianne
be
astonish
to
find
how
much
the
imagination
of
her
mother
and
herself
have
outstrip
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
really
be
not
engage
to
him
!
"
say
she
.
"
<EOS>
yet
it
certainly
soon
will
happen
.
<EOS>
but
two
advantage
will
proceed
from
this
delay
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
lose
you
so
soon
,
and
Edward
will
have
great
opportunity
of
improve
that
natural
taste
for
your
favourite
pursuit
which
must
be
so
indispensably
necessary
to
your
future
felicity
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
he
should
be
so
far
stimulate
by
your
genius
as
to
learn
to
draw
himself
,
how
delightful
it
would
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
have
give
her
real
opinion
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
consider
her
partiality
for
Edward
in
so
prosperous
a
state
as
Marianne
have
believe
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
at
time
,
a
want
of
spirit
about
him
which
,
if
it
do
not
denote
indifference
,
speak
of
something
almost
as
unpromising
.
<EOS>
a
doubt
of
her
regard
,
suppose
him
to
feel
it
,
need
not
give
him
more
than
inquietude
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
likely
to
produce
that
dejection
of
mind
which
frequently
attend
him
.
<EOS>
a
more
reasonable
cause
may
be
find
in
the
dependent
situation
which
forbid
the
indulgence
of
his
affection
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
his
mother
neither
behave
to
him
so
as
to
make
his
home
comfortable
at
present
,
nor
to
give
him
any
assurance
that
he
may
form
a
home
for
himself
,
without
strictly
attend
to
her
view
for
his
aggrandizement
.
<EOS>
with
such
a
knowledge
as
this
,
it
be
impossible
for
Elinor
to
feel
easy
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
She
be
far
from
depend
on
that
result
of
his
preference
of
her
,
which
her
mother
and
sister
still
consider
as
certain
.
<EOS>
nay
,
the
longer
they
be
together
the
more
doubtful
seem
the
nature
of
his
regard
;
and
sometimes
,
for
a
few
painful
minute
,
she
believe
it
to
be
no
more
than
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
whatever
may
really
be
its
limit
<EOS>
,
it
be
enough
,
when
perceive
by
his
sister
,
to
make
her
uneasy
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
(
which
be
still
more
common
,
)
to
make
her
uncivil
.
<EOS>
She
take
the
first
opportunity
of
affront
her
mother
-
in
-
law
on
the
occasion
,
talk
to
her
so
expressively
of
her
brother
's
great
expectation
,
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
resolution
that
both
her
son
should
marry
well
,
and
of
the
danger
attend
any
young
woman
who
attempt
to
_
draw
him
in
_
,
that
Mrs.
Dashwood
could
neither
pretend
to
be
unconscious
,
nor
endeavor
to
be
calm
.
<EOS>
She
give
her
an
answer
which
mark
her
contempt
,
and
instantly
leave
the
room
,
resolve
that
,
whatever
may
be
the
inconvenience
or
expense
of
so
sudden
a
removal
,
her
beloved
Elinor
should
not
be
expose
another
week
to
such
insinuation
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
her
spirit
,
a
letter
be
deliver
to
her
from
the
post
,
which
contain
a
proposal
particularly
well
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
offer
of
a
small
house
,
on
very
easy
term
,
belong
to
a
relation
of
her
own
,
a
gentleman
of
consequence
and
property
in
Devonshire
.
<EOS>
the
letter
be
from
this
gentleman
himself
,
and
write
in
the
true
spirit
of
friendly
accommodation
.
<EOS>
He
understand
that
she
be
in
need
of
a
dwelling
;
and
though
the
house
he
now
offer
her
be
merely
a
cottage
,
he
assure
her
that
everything
should
be
do
to
it
which
she
may
think
necessary
,
if
the
situation
please
her
.
<EOS>
He
earnestly
press
her
,
after
give
the
particular
of
the
house
and
garden
,
to
come
with
her
daughter
to
Barton
Park
,
the
place
of
his
own
residence
,
from
whence
she
may
judge
,
herself
,
whether
Barton
Cottage
,
for
the
house
be
in
the
same
parish
,
could
,
by
any
alteration
,
be
make
comfortable
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
seem
really
anxious
to
accommodate
them
and
the
whole
of
his
letter
be
write
in
so
friendly
a
style
as
could
not
fail
of
give
pleasure
to
his
cousin
;
more
especially
at
a
moment
when
she
be
suffer
under
the
cold
and
unfeele
behaviour
of
her
nearer
connection
.
<EOS>
She
need
no
time
for
deliberation
or
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Her
resolution
be
form
as
she
read
.
<EOS>
the
situation
of
Barton
,
in
a
county
so
far
distant
from
Sussex
as
Devonshire
,
which
,
but
a
few
hour
before
,
would
have
be
a
sufficient
objection
to
outweigh
every
possible
advantage
belong
to
the
place
,
be
now
its
first
recommendation
.
<EOS>
to
quit
the
neighbourhood
of
Norland
be
no
longer
an
evil
;
it
be
an
object
of
desire
;
it
be
a
blessing
,
in
comparison
of
the
misery
of
continue
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
's
guest
;
and
to
remove
for
ever
from
that
beloved
place
would
be
less
painful
than
to
inhabit
or
visit
it
while
such
a
woman
be
its
mistress
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
write
Sir
John
Middleton
her
acknowledgment
of
his
kindness
,
and
her
acceptance
of
his
proposal
;
and
then
hasten
to
show
both
letter
to
her
daughter
,
that
she
may
be
secure
of
their
approbation
before
her
answer
be
send
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
have
always
think
it
would
be
more
prudent
for
them
to
settle
at
some
distance
from
Norland
,
than
immediately
amongst
their
present
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
on
_
that
_
head
,
therefore
,
it
be
not
for
her
to
oppose
her
mother
's
intention
of
remove
into
Devonshire
.
<EOS>
the
house
,
too
,
as
describe
by
Sir
John
,
be
on
so
simple
a
scale
,
and
the
rent
so
uncommonly
moderate
,
as
to
leave
her
no
right
of
objection
on
either
point
;
and
,
therefore
,
though
it
be
not
a
plan
which
bring
any
charm
to
her
fancy
,
though
it
be
a
removal
from
the
vicinity
of
Norland
beyond
her
wish
,
she
make
no
attempt
to
dissuade
her
mother
from
send
a
letter
of
acquiescence
.
    
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
her
answer
dispatch
,
than
Mrs.
Dashwood
indulge
herself
in
the
pleasure
of
announce
to
her
son
-
in
-
law
and
his
wife
that
she
be
provide
with
a
house
,
and
should
incommode
them
no
longer
than
till
every
thing
be
ready
for
her
inhabit
it
.
<EOS>
They
hear
her
with
surprise
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
say
nothing
;
but
her
husband
civilly
hope
that
she
would
not
be
settle
far
from
Norland
.
<EOS>
She
have
great
satisfaction
in
reply
that
she
be
go
into
Devonshire
.
<EOS>
Edward
turn
hastily
towards
her
,
on
hear
this
,
and
,
in
a
voice
of
surprise
and
concern
,
which
require
no
explanation
to
her
,
repeat
,
"
devonshire
!
<EOS>
be
you
,
indeed
,
go
there
?
<EOS>
so
far
from
hence
!
<EOS>
and
to
what
part
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
She
explain
the
situation
.
<EOS>
It
be
within
four
mile
northward
of
Exeter
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
but
a
cottage
,
"
she
continue
,
"
but
I
hope
to
see
many
of
my
friend
in
it
.
<EOS>
a
room
or
two
can
easily
be
add
;
and
if
my
friend
find
no
difficulty
in
travel
so
far
to
see
me
,
I
be
sure
I
will
find
none
in
accommodate
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
conclude
with
a
very
kind
invitation
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
to
visit
her
at
Barton
;
and
to
Edward
she
give
one
with
still
great
affection
.
<EOS>
though
her
late
conversation
with
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
have
make
her
resolve
on
remain
at
Norland
no
longer
than
be
unavoidable
,
it
have
not
produce
the
small
effect
on
her
in
that
point
to
which
it
principally
tend
.
<EOS>
to
separate
Edward
and
Elinor
be
as
far
from
be
her
object
as
ever
;
and
she
wish
to
show
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
,
by
this
pointed
invitation
to
her
brother
,
how
totally
she
disregard
her
disapprobation
of
the
match
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Dashwood
tell
his
mother
again
and
again
<EOS>
how
exceedingly
sorry
he
be
that
she
have
take
a
house
at
such
a
distance
from
Norland
as
to
prevent
his
being
of
any
service
to
her
in
remove
her
furniture
.
<EOS>
He
really
feel
conscientiously
vexed
on
the
occasion
;
for
the
very
exertion
to
which
he
have
limit
the
performance
of
his
promise
to
his
father
be
by
this
arrangement
render
impracticable
.
<EOS>
the
furniture
be
all
send
around
by
water
.
<EOS>
It
chiefly
consist
of
household
linen
,
plate
,
china
,
and
book
,
with
a
handsome
pianoforte
of
Marianne
's
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
see
the
package
depart
with
a
sigh
:
she
could
not
help
feel
it
hard
that
as
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
income
would
be
so
trifle
in
comparison
with
their
own
,
she
should
have
any
handsome
article
of
furniture
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
take
the
house
for
a
twelvemonth
;
it
be
ready
furnish
,
and
she
may
have
immediate
possession
.
<EOS>
no
difficulty
arise
on
either
side
in
the
agreement
;
and
she
wait
only
for
the
disposal
of
her
effect
at
Norland
,
and
to
determine
her
future
household
,
before
she
set
off
for
the
west
;
and
this
,
as
she
be
exceedingly
rapid
in
the
performance
of
everything
that
interest
her
,
be
soon
do
.
<EOS>
the
horse
which
be
leave
her
by
her
husband
have
be
sell
soon
after
his
death
,
and
an
opportunity
now
offer
of
dispose
of
her
carriage
,
she
agree
to
sell
that
likewise
at
the
earnest
advice
of
her
eld
daughter
.
<EOS>
for
the
comfort
of
her
child
,
have
she
consult
only
her
own
wish
,
she
would
have
keep
it
;
but
the
discretion
of
Elinor
prevail
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Her
_
wisdom
too
limit
the
number
of
their
servant
to
three
;
two
maid
and
a
man
,
with
whom
they
be
speedily
provide
from
amongst
those
who
have
form
their
establishment
at
Norland
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
and
one
of
the
maid
be
send
off
immediately
into
Devonshire
,
to
prepare
the
house
for
their
mistress
's
arrival
;
for
as
Lady
Middleton
be
entirely
unknown
to
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
she
prefer
go
directly
to
the
cottage
to
be
a
visitor
at
Barton
Park
;
and
she
rely
so
undoubtingly
on
Sir
John
's
description
of
the
house
,
as
to
feel
no
curiosity
to
examine
it
herself
till
she
enter
it
as
her
own
.
<EOS>
Her
eagerness
to
be
go
from
Norland
be
preserve
from
diminution
by
the
evident
satisfaction
of
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
in
the
prospect
of
her
removal
;
a
satisfaction
which
be
but
feebly
attempt
to
be
conceal
under
a
cold
invitation
to
her
to
defer
her
departure
.
<EOS>
now
be
the
time
when
her
son
-
in
-
law
's
promise
to
his
father
may
with
particular
propriety
be
fulfil
.
<EOS>
since
he
have
neglect
to
do
it
on
first
come
to
the
estate
,
their
quit
his
house
may
be
look
on
as
the
most
suitable
period
for
its
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Dashwood
begin
shortly
to
give
over
every
hope
of
the
kind
,
and
to
be
convince
,
from
the
general
drift
of
his
discourse
,
that
his
assistance
extend
no
farther
than
their
maintenance
for
six
month
at
Norland
.
<EOS>
He
so
frequently
talk
of
the
increase
expense
of
housekeeping
,
and
of
the
perpetual
demand
upon
his
purse
,
which
a
man
of
any
consequence
in
the
world
be
beyond
calculation
expose
to
,
that
he
seem
rather
to
stand
in
need
of
more
money
himself
than
to
have
any
design
of
give
money
away
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
very
few
week
from
the
day
which
bring
Sir
John
Middleton
's
first
letter
to
Norland
,
every
thing
be
so
far
settle
in
their
future
abode
as
to
enable
Mrs.
Dashwood
and
her
daughter
to
begin
their
journey
.
  
<EOS>
many
be
the
tear
shed
by
them
in
their
last
adieus
to
a
place
so
much
beloved
.
<EOS>
"
dear
,
dear
Norland
!
"
say
Marianne
,
as
she
wander
alone
before
the
house
,
on
the
last
evening
of
their
be
there
;
"
when
shall
I
cease
to
regret
you
!
 
<EOS>
when
learn
to
feel
a
home
elsewhere
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
happy
house
<EOS>
,
could
you
know
what
I
suffer
in
now
view
you
from
this
spot
,
from
whence
perhaps
I
may
view
you
no
more
!
<EOS>
and
you
,
ye
well
-
know
tree
!
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
continue
the

<EOS>
no
leaf
will
decay
because
we
be
remove
,
nor
any
branch
become
motionless
although
we
can
observe
you
no
longer
!
<EOS>
no
;
you
will
continue
the
same
;
unconscious
of
the
pleasure
or
the
regret
you
occasion
,
and
insensible
of
any
change
in
those
who
walk
under
your
shade
!
<EOS>
but
who
will
remain
to
enjoy
you
?
"
    
<EOS>
the
first
part
of
their
journey
be
perform
in
too
melancholy
a
disposition
to
be
otherwise
than
tedious
and
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
but
as
they
draw
towards
the
end
of
it
,
their
interest
in
the
appearance
of
a
country
which
they
be
to
inhabit
overcome
their
dejection
,
and
a
view
of
Barton
Valley
as
they
enter
it
give
them
cheerfulness
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pleasant
fertile
spot
,
well
wooded
,
and
rich
in
pasture
.
<EOS>
after
wind
along
it
for
more
than
a
mile
,
they
reach
their
own
house
.
<EOS>
a
small
green
court
be
the
whole
of
its
demesne
in
front
;
and
a
neat
wicket
gate
admit
them
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
a
house
,
Barton
Cottage
,
though
small
,
be
comfortable
and
compact
;
but
as
a
cottage
it
be
defective
,
for
the
building
be
regular
,
the
roof
be
tile
,
the
window
shutter
be
not
paint
green
,
nor
be
the
wall
cover
with
honeysuckle
.
<EOS>
a
narrow
passage
lead
directly
through
the
house
into
the
garden
behind
.
<EOS>
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
be
a
sit
room
,
about
sixteen
foot
square
;
and
beyond
them
be
the
office
and
the
stair
.
<EOS>
four
bedroom
and
two
garret
form
the
rest
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
be
build
many
year
and
be
in
good
repair
.
<EOS>
in
comparison
of
Norland
,
it
be
poor
and
small
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
but
the
tear
which
recollection
call
forth
as
they
enter
the
house
be
soon
dry
away
.
<EOS>
They
be
cheer
by
the
joy
of
the
servant
on
their
arrival
,
and
each
for
the
sake
of
the
other
resolve
to
appear
happy
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
early
in
September
;
the
season
be
fine
,
and
from
first
see
the
place
under
the
advantage
of
good
weather
,
they
receive
an
impression
in
its
favour
which
be
of
material
service
in
recommend
it
to
their
last
approbation
.
  
<EOS>
the
situation
of
the
house
be
good
.
<EOS>
high
hill
rise
immediately
behind
,
and
at
no
great
distance
on
each
side
;
some
of
which
be
open
down
,
the
other
cultivate
and
woody
.
<EOS>
the
village
of
Barton
be
chiefly
on
one
of
these
hill
,
and
form
a
pleasant
view
from
the
cottage
window
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
in
front
be
more
extensive
;
it
command
the
whole
of
the
valley
,
and
reach
into
the
country
beyond
.
<EOS>
the
hill
which
surround
the
cottage
terminate
the
valley
in
that
direction
;
under
another
name
,
and
in
another
course
,
it
branch
out
again
between
two
of
the
steep
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
size
and
furniture
of
the
house
Mrs.
Dashwood
be
upon
the
whole
well
satisfied
;
for
though
her
former
style
of
life
render
many
addition
to
the
latter
indispensable
,
yet
to
add
and
improve
be
a
delight
to
her
;
and
she
have
at
this
time
ready
money
enough
to
supply
all
that
be
want
of
great
elegance
to
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
"
as
for
the
house
itself
,
to
be
sure
,
"
say
she
,
"
it
be
too
small
for
our
family
,
but
we
will
make
ourselves
tolerably
comfortable
for
the
present
,
as
it
be
too
late
in
the
year
for
improvement
.
<EOS>
perhaps
in
the
spring
,
if
I
have
plenty
of
money

as
I
dare
say
I
shall
,
we
may
think
about
build

<EOS>
these
parlor
be
both
too
small
for
such
party
of
our
friend
as
I
hope
to
see
often
collect
here
;
and
I
have
some
thought
of
throw
the
passage
into
one
of
them
with
perhaps
a
part
of
the
other
,
and
so
leave
the
remainder
of
that
other
for
an
entrance
;
this
,
with
a
new
drawing
room
which
may
be
easily
add
,
and
a
bed
-
chamber
and
garret
above
,
will
make
it
a
very
snug
little
cottage
.
<EOS>
I
could
wish
the
stair
be
handsome
.
<EOS>
but
one
must
not
expect
every
thing
;
though
I
suppose
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
widen
them
.
<EOS>
I
shall
see
how
much
I
be
before
-
hand
with
the
world
in
the
spring
,
and
we
will
plan
our
improvement
accordingly

in

all

from
the

of
an
income
of
five
hundred

a

in

soon
after
breakfast
the
next

by
the
entrance

every

<EOS>
Sir
John
Middleton
be
a
good
looking
man
about
forty
.
<EOS>
He
have
formerly
visit
at
Stanhill
,
but
it
be
too
long
for
his
young
cousin
to
remember
him
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
be
thoroughly
good
-
humoured
;
and
his
manner
be
as
friendly
as
the
style
of
his
letter
.
<EOS>
Their
arrival
seem
to
afford
him
real
satisfaction
,
and
their
comfort
to
be
an
object
of
real
solicitude
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
say
much
of
his
earnest
desire
of
their
living
in
the
most
sociable
term
with
his
family
,
and
press
them
so
cordially
to
dine
at
Barton
Park
every
day
till
they
be
better
settle
at
home
,
that
,
though
his
entreaty
be
carry
to
a
point
of
perseverance
beyond
civility
,
they
could
not
give
offence
.
<EOS>
His
kindness
be
not
confine
to
word
;
for
within
an
hour
after
he
leave
them
,
a
large
basket
full
of
garden
stuff
and
fruit
arrive
from
the
park
,
which
be
follow
before
the
end
of
the
day
by
a
present
of
game
.
<EOS>
He
insist
,
moreover
,
on
convey
all
their
letter
to
and
from
the
post
for
them
,
and
would
not
be
deny
the
satisfaction
of
send
them
his
newspaper
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
have
send
a
very
civil
message
by
him
,
denote
her
intention
of
wait
on
Mrs.
Dashwood
as
soon
as
she
could
be
assure
that
her
visit
would
be
no
inconvenience
;
and
as
this
message
be
answer
by
an
invitation
equally
polite
,
her
ladyship
be
introduce
to
them
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
,
of
course
,
very
anxious
to
see
a
person
on
whom
so
much
of
their
comfort
at
Barton
must
depend
;
and
the
elegance
of
her
appearance
be
favourable
to
their
wish
.
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
be
not
more
than
six
or
seven
and
twenty
;
her
face
be
handsome
,
her
figure
tall
and
striking
,
and
her
address
graceful
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
have
all
the
elegance
which
her
husband
's
want
.
<EOS>
but
they
would
have
be
improve
by
some
share
of
his
frankness
and
warmth
;
and
her
visit
be
long
enough
to
detract
something
from
their
first
admiration
,
by
show
that
,
though
perfectly
well
-
breed
,
she
be
reserve
,
cold
,
and
have
nothing
to
say
for
herself
beyond
the
most
common
-
place
inquiry
or
remark
.
  
<EOS>
conversation
however
be
not
want
,
for
Sir
John
be
very
chatty
,
and
Lady
Middleton
have
take
the
wise
precaution
of
bring
with
her
their
eld
child
,
a
fine
little
boy
about
six
year
old
,
by
which
mean
there
be
one
subject
always
to
be
recur
to
by
the
lady
in
case
of
extremity
,
for
they
have
to
enquire
his
name
and
age
<EOS>
,
admire
his
beauty
,
and
ask
him
question
which
his
mother
answer
for
him
,
while
he
hang
about
her
and
hold
down
his
head
,
to
the
great
surprise
of
her
ladyship
,
who
wonder
at
his
be
so
shy
before
company
,
as
he
could
make
noise
enough
at
home
.
<EOS>
on
every
formal
visit
a
child
ought
to
be
of
the
party
,
by
way
of
provision
for
discourse
.
<EOS>
in
the
present
case
it
take
up
ten
minute
to
determine
whether
the
boy
be
most
like
his
father
or
mother
,
and
in
what
particular
he
resemble
either
,
for
of
course
every
body
differ
,
and
every
body
be
astonish
at
the
opinion
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
an
opportunity
be
soon
to
be
give
to
the
dashwood
of
debate
on
the
rest
of
the
child
,
as
Sir
John
would
not
leave
the
house
without
secure
their
promise
of
dining
at
the
park
the
next
day
.
    
<EOS>
Barton
Park
be
about
half
a
mile
from
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
the
lady
have
pass
near
it
in
their
way
along
the
valley
,
but
it
be
screen
from
their
view
at
home
by
the
projection
of
a
hill
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
large
and
handsome
;
and
the
Middletons
live
in
a
style
of
equal
hospitality
and
elegance
.
<EOS>
the
former
be
for
Sir
John
's
gratification
,
the
latter
for
that
of
his
lady
.
<EOS>
They
be
scarcely
ever
without
some
friend
stay
with
them
in
the
house
,
and
they
keep
more
company
of
every
kind
than
any
other
family
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
the
happiness
of
both
;
for
however
dissimilar
in
temper
and
outward
behaviour
,
they
strongly
resemble
each
other
in
that
total
want
of
talent
and
taste
which
confine
their
employment
,
unconnecte
with
such
as
society
produce
,
within
a
very
narrow
compass
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
be
a
sportsman
,
Lady
Middleton
a
mother
.
<EOS>
He
hunt
and
shoot
,
and
she
humour
her
child
;
and
these
be
their
only
resource
.
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
have
the
advantage
of
be
able
to
spoil
her
child
all
the
year
round
,
while
Sir
John
's
independent
employment
be
in
existence
only
half
the
time
.
<EOS>
continual
engagement
at
home
and
abroad
,
however
,
supply
all
the
deficiency
of
nature
and
education
;
support
the
good
spirit
of
Sir
John
,
and
give
exercise
to
the
good
breeding
of
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
pique
herself
upon
the
elegance
of
her
table
,
and
of
all
her
domestic
arrangement
;
and
from
this
kind
of
vanity
be
her
great
enjoyment
in
any
of
their
party
.
<EOS>
but
Sir
John
's
satisfaction
in
society
be
much
more
real
;
he
delight
in
collect
about
him
more
young
people
than
his
house
would
hold
,
and
the
noisier
they
be
the
well
be
he
please
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
blessing
to
all
the
juvenile
part
of
the
neighbourhood
,
for
in
summer
he
be
for
ever
form
party
to
eat
cold
ham
and
chicken
out
of
door
,
and
in
winter
his
private
ball
be
numerous
enough
for
any
young
lady
who
be
not
suffer
under
the
insatiable
appetite
of
fifteen
.
  
<EOS>
the
arrival
of
a
new
family
in
the
country
be
always
a
matter
of
joy
to
him
,
and
in
every
point
of
view
he
be
charm
with
the
inhabitant
he
have
now
procure
for
his
cottage
at
Barton
.
<EOS>
the
Miss
Dashwoods
be
young
,
pretty
,
and
unaffected
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
secure
his
good
opinion
;
for
to
be
unaffected
be
all
that
a
pretty
girl
could
want
to
make
her
mind
as
captivate
as
her
person
.
<EOS>
the
friendliness
of
his
disposition
make
him
happy
in
accommodate
those
,
whose
situation
may
be
consider
,
in
comparison
with
the
past
,
as
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
in
show
kindness
to
his
cousin
therefore
he
have
the
real
satisfaction
of
a
good
heart
;
and
in
settle
a
family
of
female
only
in
his
cottage
,
he
have
all
the
satisfaction
of
a
sportsman
;
for
a
sportsman
,
though
he
esteem
only
those
of
his
sex
who
be
sportsman
likewise
,
be
not
often
desirous
of
encourage
their
taste
by
admit
them
to
a
residence
within
his
own
manor
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
and
her
daughter
be
meet
at
the
door
of
the
house
by
Sir
John
,
who
welcome
them
to
Barton
Park
with
unaffected
sincerity
;
and
as
he
attend
them
to
the
drawing
room
repeat
to
the
young
lady
the
concern
which
the
same
subject
have
draw
from
him
the
day
before
,
at
be
unable
to
get
any
smart
young
man
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
They
would
see
,
he
say
,
only
one
gentleman
there
besides
himself
;
a
particular
friend
who
be
stay
at
the
park
,
but
who
be
neither
very
young
nor
very
gay
.
<EOS>
He
hope
they
would
all
excuse
the
smallness
of
the
party
,
and
could
assure
them
it
should
never
happen
so
again
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
to
several
family
that
morning
in
hope
of
procure
some
addition
to
their
number
,
but
it
be
moonlight
and
<EOS>
every
body
be
full
of
engagement
.
<EOS>
luckily
Lady
Middleton
's
mother
have
arrive
at
Barton
within
the
last
hour
,
and
as
she
be
a
very
cheerful
agreeable
woman
,
he
hope
the
young
lady
would
not
find
it
so
very
dull
as
they
may
imagine
.
<EOS>
the
young
lady
,
as
well
as
their
mother
,
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
have
two
entire
stranger
of
the
party
,
and
wish
for
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
,
Lady
Middleton
's
mother

be
a
good

humoured
,
merry
,
fat
,
elderly
woman
,
who
talk
a
great
deal
,
seem
very
happy
,
and
rather
vulgar

<EOS>
She
be
full
of
joke
and
laughter
,
and
before
dinner
be
over
<EOS>
have
say
many
witty
thing
on
the
subject
of
lover
and
husband
;
hope
they
have
not
leave
their
heart
behind
them
in
Sussex
,
and
pretend
to
see
them
blush
whether
they
do
or
not
.
<EOS>
Marianne
be
vex
at
it
for
her
sister
's
sake
,
and
turn
her
eye
towards
Elinor
to
see
how
she
bear
these
attack
,
with
an
earnestness
which
give
Elinor
far
more
pain
than
could
arise
from
such
common
-
place
raillery
as
Mrs.
Jennings
's
.
  
<EOS>
Colonel
Brandon
,
the
friend
of
Sir
John
,
seem
no
more
adapt
by
resemblance
of
manner
to
be
his
friend
,
than
Lady
Middleton
be
to
be
his
wife
,
or
Mrs.
Jennings
to
be
Lady
Middleton
's
mother
.
<EOS>
He
be
silent
and
grave
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
however
be
not
unplease
,
in
spite
of
his
being
in
the
opinion
of
Marianne
and
Margaret
an
absolute
old
bachelor
,
for
he
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
five
and
thirty
;
but
though
his
face
be
not
handsome
,
his
countenance
be
sensible
,
and
his
address
be
particularly
gentlemanlike
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
any
of
the
party
which
could
recommend
them
as
companion
to
the
Dashwoods
;
but
the
cold
insipidity
of
Lady
Middleton
be
so
particularly
repulsive
,
that
in
comparison
of
it
the
gravity
of
Colonel
Brandon
,
and
even
the
boisterous
mirth
of
Sir
John
and
his
mother
-
in
-
law
be
interesting
.
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
seem
to
be
rouse
to
enjoyment
only
by
the
entrance
of
her
four
noisy
child
after
dinner
,
who
pull
her
about
,
tear
her
clothe
,
and
put
an
end
to
every
kind
of
discourse
except
what
relate
to
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
as
Marianne
be
discover
to
be
musical
,
she
be
invite
to
play
.
<EOS>
the
instrument
be
unlock
,
every
body
prepare
to
be
charm
,
and
Marianne
,
who
sing
very
well
,
at
their
request
go
through
the
chief
of
the
song
which
Lady
Middleton
have
bring
into
the
family
on
her
marriage
,
and
which
perhaps
have
lain
ever
since
in
the
same
position
on
the
pianoforte
,
for
her
ladyship
have
celebrate
that
event
by
give
up
music
,
although
by
her
mother
's
account
,
she
have
play
extremely
well
,
and
by
her
own
be
very
fond
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
's
performance
be
highly
applaud
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
be
loud
in
his
admiration
at
the
end
of
every
song
,
and
as
loud
in
his
conversation
with
the
other
while
every
song
last
.
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
frequently
call
him
to
order
,
wonder
how
any
one
's
attention
could
be
divert
from
music
for
a
moment
,
and
ask
Marianne
to
sing
a
particular
song
which
Marianne
have
just
finish
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Brandon
alone
,
of
all
the
party
,
hear
her
without
be
in
rapture
.
<EOS>
He
pay
her
only
the
compliment
of
attention
;
and
she
feel
a
respect
for
him
on
the
occasion
,
which
the
other
have
reasonably
forfeit
by
their
shameless
want
of
taste
.
<EOS>
His
pleasure
in
music
,
though
it
amount
not
to
that
ecstatic
delight
which
alone
could
sympathize
with
her
own
,
be
estimable
when
contrast
against
the
horrible
insensibility
of
the
other
;
and
she
be
reasonable
enough
to
allow
that
a
man
of
five
and
thirty
may
well
have
outlive
all
acuteness
of
feeling
and
every
exquisite
power
of
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
She
be
perfectly
dispose
to
make
every
allowance
for
the
colonel
's
advanced
state
of
life
which
humanity
require
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
be
a
widow
with
an
ample
jointure
.
<EOS>
She
have
only
two
daughter
,
both
of
whom
she
have
live
to
see
respectably
married
,
and
she
have
now
therefore
nothing
to
do
but
to
marry
all
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
in
the
promotion
of
this
object
she
be
zealously
active
,
as
far
as
her
ability
reach
;
and
miss
no
opportunity
of
project
wedding
among
all
the
young
people
of
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
She
be
remarkably
quick
in
the
discovery
of
attachment
,
and
have
enjoy
the
advantage
of
raise
the
blush
and
the
vanity
of
many
a
young
lady
by
insinuation
of
her
power
over
such
a
young
man
;
and
this
kind
of
discernment
enable
her
soon
after
her
arrival
at
Barton
decisively
to
pronounce
that
Colonel
Brandon
be
very
much
in
love
with
Marianne
Dashwood
.
<EOS>
She
rather
suspect
it
to
be
so
,
on
the
very
first
evening
of
their
be
together
,
from
his
listening
so
attentively
while
she
sing
to
them
;
and
when
the
visit
be

It

She

It

<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
have
be
anxious
to
see
Colonel
Brandon
<EOS>
well
married
,
ever
since
her
connection
with
Sir
John
first
bring
him
to
her
knowledge
;
and
she
be
always
anxious
to
get
a
good
husband
for
every
pretty
girl
.
  
<EOS>
the
immediate
advantage
to
herself
be
by
no
means
inconsiderable
,
for
it
supply
her
with
endless
joke
against
them
both

<EOS>
at
the
park
she
laugh
at
the
colonel
,
and
in
the
cottage
at
Marianne

<EOS>
to
the
former
her
raillery
be
probably
,
as
far
as
it
regard
only
himself
,
perfectly
indifferent
;
but
to
the
latter
it
be
at
first
incomprehensible
;
and
when
its
object
be
understand
,
she
hardly
know
whether
most
to
laugh
at
its
absurdity
,
or
censure
its
impertinence
,
for
she
consider
it
as
an
unfeeling
reflection
on
the
colonel
's
advanced
year
,
and
on
his
forlorn
condition
as
an
old
bachelor
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
who
could
not
think
a
man
five
year
young
than
herself
,
so
exceedingly
ancient
as
he
appear
to
the
youthful
fancy
of
her
daughter
,
venture
to
clear
Mrs.
Jennings
from
the
probability
of
wish
to
throw
ridicule
on
his
age
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
at

,
Mamma
,
you
can
not
deny
the
absurdity
of
the
accusation
,
though
you
may
not
think
it
intentionally
ill
-
natured
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Brandon
be
certainly
young
than
Mrs.
Jennings
,
but
he
be
old
enough
to
be
_
<EOS>
my
_
father

and
if
he
be
ever
animate
enough
to
be
in
love
,
must
have
long
outlive
every
sensation
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
ridiculous
!
<EOS>
when
be
a
man
to
be
safe
from
such
wit

if
age

infirmity
will
not
protect
him

infirmity
!
"
say
Elinor

"
do
you
call
Colonel
Brandon
infirm
?
<EOS>
I
can
easily
suppose
that
his
age
may
appear
much
great
to
you
than
to
my
mother
;
but
you
can
hardly
deceive
yourself
as

the
use

<EOS>
"
do
not
you
hear
him

life

<EOS>
"
My

,
"
at
this
rate
you
must
be
in
continual
terror
of

decay

a

"
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
you
be
not

me
justice

<EOS>
I
know
very
well
that
Colonel
Brandon
be
not
old
enough
to
make
his
friend
yet
apprehensive
of
lose
him
in
the
course

nature

<EOS>
He
may
live
twenty
year
longer

<EOS>

thirty

five
have
nothing

"
  
<EOS>

perhaps
,

Elinor
,
"
thirty
-
five
and
seventeen
have
well
not
have
any
thing
to
do
with
matrimony

<EOS>
but
if
there
should
by
any
chance
happen
to
be
a
woman
who
be
single
at
seven
and
twenty
,
I
should
not

Colonel

any
objection

his
marrying

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
woman
of
seven
and
twenty
,
"
say
Marianne
,
after
pause
a
moment
,
"
can
never
hope
to
feel
or
inspire
affection
again
,
and
if
her
home
be
uncomfortable
,
or
her
fortune
small
,
I
can
suppose
that
she
may
bring
herself
to
submit
to
the
office
of
a
nurse
,
for
the
sake
of
the
provision
and
security
of
a
wife

<EOS>
in
his
marrying
such
a
woman
therefore
there
would
be
nothing
unsuitable
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
compact
of
convenience
,
and
the

would
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
in
my
eye
it
would
be
no
marriage
at
all
,
but
that
would
be
nothing
.
<EOS>
to
me
it
would
seem
only
a
commercial
exchange

in
which
each

benefit
at
the
expense

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
impossible

I
know
,

reply
Elinor
,
"
to
convince
you

enough
to
love

I
must
object
to
your
doom
Colonel
Brandon

his

to
the
constant
confinement
of
a
sick
chamber

merely
because

take
her
up
in
his
arm
without

a
rapidity
of
thought
which

<EOS>
His

and

out
that

all
manly

the
most
becoming

<EOS>
Her
imagination

busy

her
reflection

pleasant
,
and
the
pain
of
a
sprain
ankle
be
disregard

<EOS>
Sir
John
call
on
them
as
soon
as
the
next
interval
of
fair

morning
allow

and
Marianne

relate
to

,
he
be
eagerly
ask
whether
he
know
any
gentleman
of
the
name

<EOS>
"
Willoughby

"
cry
Sir
John
;
"

<EOS>

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
that

good
news
however

I

<EOS>
"
You

I

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
sort
of
a
young

?
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
good
a
kind
of
fellow
as

,
I
assure
you

<EOS>
a
very
decent

,
and
there

not
a

in
England

"
and
be
that
all
you
can
say
for

"
cry
Marianne
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
his
manner
on
more
intimate
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
what
his
pursuit
,
his
talent
,
and
genius
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
be
rather
puzzle
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
soul
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
do
not
know
much
about
him
as
to
all

that
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
pleasant
,
good
humoured
fellow
,
and
have
get
the
nice
little
black
bitch
of
a
pointer
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
be
she
out
with
him
today
?
"
  
<EOS>
but
Marianne
could
no
more
satisfy
him
as
to
the
colour
of
Mr.
Willoughby
's
pointer
,
than
he
could
describe
to
her
the
shade
of
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
who
be
he
?
"
say
Elinor
.
<EOS>
"
where
do
he
come
from
?
<EOS>
have
he
a
house
at
Allenham
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
this
point
Sir
John
could
give
more
certain
intelligence
;
and
he
tell
them
that
Mr.
Willoughby
have
no
property
of
his
own
in
the
country
;
that
he
reside
there
only
while
he
be
visit
the
old
lady
at
Allenham
Court
,
to
whom
he
be
relate
,
and
whose
possession
he
be
to
inherit
;
add
,
"
yes
,
yes
,
he
be
very
well
worth
catch
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
,
Miss
Dashwood
;
he
have
a
pretty
little
estate
of
his
own
in
Somersetshire
besides
;
and
if
I
be
you
,
I
would
not
give
him
up
to
my
young
sister
,
in
spite
of
all
this
tumble
down
hill
.
<EOS>
Miss
Marianne
must
not
expect
to
have
all
the
man
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Brandon
will
be
jealous
,
if
she
do
not
take
care
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
,
"
say
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
with
a
good
humoured
smile
,
"
that
Mr.
Willoughby
will
be
incommode
by
the
attempt

him

<EOS>
It

not

up

<EOS>
man
be
very
safe
with
us
,
let
them
be
ever
so
rich
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
find
,
however
,
from
what
you
say
,
that
he
be
a
respectable
young
man
,
and
one
whose
acquaintance
will
not
be
ineligible

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
as
good
a
sort
of
fellow
,
I
believe
,
as
ever
live
,
"
repeat
Sir
John
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
last
Christmas
at
a
little
hop
at
the
park
,
he
dance
from
eight
o'clock
till
four
,
without
once
sit
down
.

<EOS>
"
do
he
indeed
?
"
cry
Marianne
with
sparkling
eye
,
"
and
with
elegance
,
with
spirit
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
and
he
be
up
again
at
eight
to
ride
to
covert
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
I
like
;
that
be
what
a
young
man
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
whatever
be
his
pursuit
,
his
eagerness
in
them
should
know
no
moderation
,
and
leave
him
no
sense
of
fatigue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
aye
,
I
see
how
it
will
be
,
"
say
Sir
John
,
"
I
see
how
it
will
be
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
set
your
cap
at
him
now
,
and
never
think
of
poor
Brandon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
an
expression
,
Sir
John
,
"
say
Marianne
,
warmly
,
"
which
I
particularly
dislike
.
<EOS>
I
abhor
every
common

place
phrase

intend
;

"
set
one

cap
at
a
man

"
make
a
conquest
,
"
be
the
most
odious
of
all
.
<EOS>
Their
tendency
be
gross
and
illiberal
;
and
if
their
construction
could
ever
be
deem
clever
,
time
have
long
ago
destroy
all
its
ingenuity

"
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
do
not
much
understand
this
reproof
;
but
he
laugh
as
heartily
as
if
he
do
,
and
then
reply
    
"
ay
,
you
will
make
conquest
enough
,
I
dare
say
,
one
way
or
other
.
<EOS>
poor
Brandon
!
<EOS>
he
be
quite
smitten
already
,
and
he
be
very
well
worth
set
your
cap
at
<EOS>
,
I
can
tell
you
,
in
spite
of
all
this
tumble
about
and
spraining
of
ankle
.
"
    
<EOS>
Marianne
's
preserver
,
as
Margaret
,
with
more
elegance
than
precision
,
style
Willoughby
,
call
at
the
cottage
early
the
next
morning
to
make
his
personal
enquiry
.
<EOS>
He
be
receive
by
Mrs.
Dashwood
with
more
than
politeness
;
with
a
kindness
which
Sir
John
's
account
of
him
and
her
own
gratitude
prompt
;
and
every
thing
that
pass
during
the
visit
tend
to
assure
him
of
the
sense
,
elegance
,
mutual
affection
,
and
domestic
comfort
of
the
family
to
whom
accident
have
now
introduce
him
.
<EOS>
of
their
personal
charm
he
have
not
require
a
second
interview
to
be
convince
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Dashwood
have
a
delicate
complexion
,
regular
feature
,
and
a
remarkably
pretty
figure
.
<EOS>
Marianne
be
still
handsome
.
<EOS>
Her
form
,
though
not
so
correct
as
her
sister
's
,
in
have
the
advantage
of
height
,
be
more
striking
;
and
her
face
be
so
lovely
,
that
when
in
the
common
can
not
of
praise
,
she
be
call
a
beautiful
girl
<EOS>
,
truth
be
less
violently
outraged
than
usually
happen
.
<EOS>
Her
skin
be
very
brown
,
but
,
from
its
transparency
,
her
complexion
be
uncommonly
brilliant
;
her
feature
be
all
good
;
her
smile
be
sweet
and
attractive
;
and
in
her
eye
,
which
be
very
dark
,
there
be
a
life
,
a
spirit
,
an
eagerness
,
which
could
hardily
be
see
without
delight
.
<EOS>
from
Willoughby
their
expression
be
at
first
hold
back
,
by
the
embarrassment
which
the
remembrance
of
his
assistance
create
.
<EOS>
but
when
this
pass
away
,
when
her
spirit
become
collect
,
when
she
see
that
to
the
perfect
good
-
breeding
of
the
gentleman
,
he
unite
frankness
and
vivacity
,
and
above
all
,
when
she
hear
him
declare
,
that
of
music
and
dance
he
be
passionately
fond
,
she
give
him
such
a
look
of
approbation
as
secure
the
large
share
of
his
discourse
to
herself
for
the
rest
of
his
stay
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
only
necessary
to
mention
any
favourite
amusement
to
engage
her
to
talk
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
silent
when
such
point
be
introduce
,
and
she
have
neither
shyness
nor
reserve
in
their
discussion
.
<EOS>
They
speedily
discover
that
their
enjoyment
of
dancing
and
music
be
mutual
,
and
that
it
arise
from
a
general
conformity
of
judgment
in
all
that
relate
to
either
.
<EOS>
encourage
by
this
to
a
further
examination
of
his
opinion
,
she
proceed
to
question
him
on
the
subject
of
book
;
her
favourite
author
be
bring
forward
and
dwelt
upon
with
so
rapturous
a
delight
,
that
any
young
man
of
five
and
twenty
must
have
be
insensible
indeed
,
not
to
become
an
immediate
convert
to
the
excellence
of
such
work
,
however
disregard
before
.
<EOS>
Their
taste
be
strikingly
alike
.
<EOS>
the
same
book
,
the
same
passage
be
idolize
by
each
;
or
if
any
difference
appear
,
any
objection
arise
,
it
last
no
longer
than
till
the
force
of
her
argument
and
the
brightness
of
her
eye
could
be
display
.
<EOS>
He
acquiesce
in
all
her
decision
,
catch
all
her
enthusiasm
;
and
long
before
his
visit
conclude
,
they
converse
with
the
familiarity
of
a
long
-
establish
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Marianne
,
"
say
Elinor
,
as
soon
as
he
have
leave
them
,
"
for
_
one
<EOS>
_
morning
I
think
you
have
do
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
You
have
already
ascertain
Mr.
Willoughby
's
opinion
in
almost
every
matter
of
importance
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
he
think
of
Cowper
and
Scott
;
you
be
certain
of
his
estimate
their
beauty
as
he
ought
,
and
you
have
receive
every
assurance
of
his
admire
Pope
no
more
than
be
proper
.
<EOS>
but
how
be
your
acquaintance
to
be
long
support
,
under
such
extraordinary
despatch
of
every
subject
for
discourse
?
<EOS>
You
will
soon
have
exhaust
each
favourite
topic
.
<EOS>
another
meeting
will
suffice
to
explain
his
sentiment
on
picturesque
beauty
,
and
second
marriage
,
and
then
you
can
have
nothing
farther
to
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Elinor
,
"
cry
Marianne
,
"
be
this
fair
?
<EOS>
be
this
just
?
<EOS>
be
my
idea
so
scanty
?
<EOS>
but
I
see
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
too
much
at
my
ease
,
too
happy
<EOS>
,
too
frank
.
<EOS>
I
have
err
against
every
common
-
place
notion
of
decorum
;
I
have
be
open
and
sincere
where
I
ought
to
have
be
reserve
,
spiritless
,
dull
,
and
deceitful
:
 
<EOS>
have
I
talk
only
of
the
weather
and
the
road
,
and
have
I
speak
only
once
in
ten
minute
,
this
reproach
would
have
be
spare
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
say
her
mother
,
"
you
must
not
be
offend
with
Elinor
 
<EOS>
she
be
only
in
jest
.
<EOS>
I
should
scold
her
myself
,
if
she
be
capable
of
wish
to
check
the
delight
of
your
conversation
with
our
new
friend
.
<EOS>
"
Marianne
be
soften
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
Willoughby
,
on
his
side
,
give
every
proof
of
his
pleasure
in
their
acquaintance
,
which
an
evident
wish
of
improve
it
could
offer
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
them
every
day
.
<EOS>
to
enquire
after
Marianne
be
at
first
his
excuse
;
but
the
encouragement
of
his
reception
,
to
which
every
day
give
great
kindness
,
make
such
an
excuse
unnecessary
before
it
have
cease
to
be
possible
,
by
Marianne
's
perfect
recovery
.
<EOS>
She
be
confine
for
some
day
to
the
house
;
but
never
have
any
confinement
be
less
irksome
.
<EOS>
Willoughby
be
a
young
man
of
good
ability
,
quick
imagination
,
lively
spirit
,
and
open
,
affectionate
manner
.
<EOS>
He
be
exactly
form
to
engage
Marianne
's
heart
,
for
with
all
this
,
he
join
not
only
a
captivate
person
,
but
a
natural
ardour
of
mind
which
be
now
rouse
and
increase
by
the
example
of
her
own
,
and
which
recommend
him
to
her
affection
beyond
every
thing
else
.
  
<EOS>
His
society
become
gradually
her
most
exquisite
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
They
read
<EOS>
,
they
talk
,
they
sing
together
;
his
musical
talent
be
considerable
;
and
he
read
with
all
the
sensibility
and
spirit
which
Edward
have
unfortunately
want
.
  
<EOS>
in
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
estimation
he
be
as
faultless
as
in
Marianne
's
;
and
Elinor
see
nothing
to
censure
in
him
but
a
propensity
,
in
which
he
strongly
resemble
and
peculiarly
delight
her
sister
,
of
say
too
much
what
he
think
on
every
occasion
,
without
attention
to
person
or
circumstance
.
<EOS>
in
hastily
form
and
give
his
opinion
of
other
people
,
in
sacrifice
general
politeness
to
the
enjoyment
of
undivided
attention
where
his
heart
be
engage
,
and
in
slight
too
easily
the
form
of
worldly
propriety
,
he
display
a
want
of
caution
which
Elinor
could
not
approve
,
in
spite
of
all
that
he
and
Marianne
could
say
in
its
support
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
begin
now
to
perceive
that
the
desperation
which
have
seize
her
at
sixteen
and
a
half
,
of
ever
see
a
man
who
could
satisfy
her
idea
of
perfection
,
have
be
rash
and
unjustifiable
.
<EOS>
Willoughby
be
all
that
her
fancy
have
delineate
in
that
unhappy
hour
and
in
every
bright
period
,
as
capable
of
attach
her
;
and
his
behaviour
declare
his
wish
to
be
in
that
respect
as
earnest
,
as
his
ability
be
strong
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mother
too
,
in
whose
mind
not
one
speculative
thought
of
their
marriage
have
be
raise
,
by
his
prospect
of
rich
,
be
lead
before
the
end
of
a
week
to
hope
and
expect
it
;
and
secretly
to
congratulate
herself
on
have
gain
two
such
son
-
in
-
law
as
Edward
and
Willoughby
.
  
<EOS>
Colonel
Brandon
's
partiality
for
Marianne
,
which
have
so
early
be
discover
by
his
friend
,
now
first
become
perceptible
to
Elinor
,
when
it
cease
to
be
notice
by
them
.
<EOS>
Their
attention
and
wit
be
draw
off
to
his
more
fortunate
rival
;
and
the
raillery
which
the
other
have
incur
before
any
partiality
arise
,
be
remove
when
his
feeling
begin
really
to
call
for
the
ridicule
so
justly
annex
to
sensibility
.
<EOS>
Elinor
be
oblige
,
though
unwillingly
,
to
believe
that
the
sentiment
which
Mrs.
Jennings
have
assign
him
for
her
own
satisfaction
,
be
now
actually
excited
by
her
sister
;
and
that
however
a
general
resemblance
of
disposition
between
the
party
may
forward
the
affection
of
Mr.
Willoughby
,
an
equally
striking
opposition
of
character
be
no
hindrance
to
the
regard
of
Colonel
Brandon
.
<EOS>
She
see
it
with
concern
;
for
what
could

man

five

to
a
very
lively
one

five

twenty

<EOS>
and
as
she
could
not
even
wish
him
successful
,
she
heartily
wish
him
indifferent
.
<EOS>
She
like
him
 
in
spite
of
his
gravity
and
reserve
,
she
behold
in
him
an
object
of
interest
.
<EOS>
His
manner
,
though
serious
,
be
mild
;
and
his
reserve
appear
rather
the
result
of
some
oppression
of
spirit
than
of
any
natural
gloominess
of
temper
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
have
drop
hint
of
past
injury
and
disappointment
,
which
justify
her
belief
of
his
be
an
unfortunate
man
,
and
she
regard
him
with
respect
and
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
she
pity
and
esteem
him
the
more
because
he
be
slight
by
Willoughby
and
Marianne
,
who
,
prejudice
against
him
for
be
neither
lively
nor
young
,
seem
resolve
to
undervalue
his
merit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brandon
be
just
the
kind
of
man
,
"
say
Willoughby
one
day
,
when
they
be
talk
of
him
together
,
"
whom
every
body
speak
well
of
,
and
nobody
care
about

whom
all
be
delighted
to
see

nobody
remember
to
talk
to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that

what

<EOS>

injustice

<EOS>
He

highly

by
all
the

I
never

him

take
pain

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
he

Willoughby

certainly
in
his

as
for

<EOS>
who
would
submit
to
the
indignity

such
a

Jennings

that
could
command

<EOS>

perhaps
the
abuse
of
such
people

make
amend
for
the

of
Lady
Middleton

her
mother

<EOS>

your

so
much

that
the

three
unanswerable
reason

<EOS>
Little
have
Mrs.
Dashwood
or
her
daughter
imagine
when
they
first
come
into
Devonshire
,
that
so
many
engagement
would
arise
to
occupy
their
time
as
shortly
present
themselves
,
or
that
they
should
have
such
frequent
invitation
and
such
constant
visitor
as
to
leave
them
little
leisure
for
serious
employment
.
<EOS>
yet
such
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
when
Marianne
be
recover
,
the
scheme
of
amusement
at
home
and
abroad
,
which
Sir
John
have
be
previously
form
,
be
put
into
execution
.
<EOS>
the
private
ball
at
the
park
then
begin
;
and
party
on
the
water
be
make
and
accomplish
as
often
as
a
showery
October
would
allow
.
<EOS>
in
every
meeting
of
the
kind
Willoughby
be
include
;
and
the
ease
and
familiarity
which
naturally
attend
these
party
be
exactly
calculate
to
give
increase
intimacy
to
his
acquaintance
with
the
Dashwoods
,
to
afford
him
opportunity
of
witness
the
excellency
of
Marianne
,
of
mark
his
animate
admiration
of
her
,
and
of
receiving
,
in
her
behaviour
to
himself
,
the
most
pointed
assurance
of
her
affection
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
could
not
be
surprised
at
their
attachment
.
<EOS>
She
only
wish
that
it
be
less
openly
show
;
and
once
or
twice
do
venture
to
suggest
the
propriety
of
some
self
-
command
to
Marianne
.
<EOS>
but
Marianne
abhor
all
concealment
where
no
real
disgrace
could
attend
unreserve
;
and
to
aim
at
the
restraint
of
sentiment
which
be
not
in
themselves
illaudable
,
appear
to
her
not
merely
an
unnecessary
effort
,
but
a
disgraceful
subjection
of
reason
to
common
-
place
and
mistaken
notion
.
<EOS>
Willoughby
think
the
same
;
and
their
behaviour
at
all
time
,
be
an
illustration
of
their
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
present
she
have
no
eye
for
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
every
thing
he
do
,
be
right
.
<EOS>
every
thing
he
say
,
be
clever
.
<EOS>
if
their
evening
at
the
park
be
conclude
with
card
,
he
cheat
himself
and
all
the
rest
of
the
party
to
get
her
a
good
hand
.
<EOS>
if
dancing
form
the
amusement
of
the
night
,
they
be
partner
for
half
the
time
;
and
when
oblige
to
separate
for
a
couple
of
dance
,
be
careful
to
stand
together
and
scarcely
speak
a
word
to
any
body
else
.
<EOS>
such
conduct
make
them
of
course
most
exceedingly
laugh
at
;
but
ridicule
could
not
shame
,
and
seem
hardly
to
provoke
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
enter
into
all
their
feeling
with
a
warmth
which
leave
her
no
inclination
for
check
this
excessive
display
of
them
.
<EOS>
to
her
it
be
but
the
natural
consequence
of
a
strong
affection
in
a
young
and
ardent
mind
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
season
of
happiness
to
Marianne
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
devoted
to
Willoughby
,
and
the
fond
attachment
to
Norland
,
which
she
bring
with
her
from
Sussex
,
be
more
likely
to
be
soften
than
she
have
think
it
possible
before
,
by
the
charm
which
his
society
bestow
on
her
present
home
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
's
happiness
be
not
so
great
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
not
so
much
at
ease
,
nor
her
satisfaction
in
their
amusement
so
pure
.
<EOS>
They
afford
her
no
companion
that
could
make
amend
for
what
she
have
leave
behind
,
nor
that
could
teach
her
to
think
of
Norland
with
less
regret
than
ever
.
<EOS>
neither
Lady
Middleton
nor
Mrs.
Jennings
could
supply
to
her
the
conversation
she
miss
;
although
the
latter
be
an
everlasting
talker
,
and
from
the
first
have
regard
her
with
a
kindness
which
ensure
her
a
large
share
of
her
discourse
.
<EOS>
She
have
already
repeat
her
own
history
to
Elinor
three
or
four
time
;
and
have
Elinor
's
memory
be
equal
to
her
mean
of
improvement
,
she
may
have
know
very
early
in
their
acquaintance
all
the
particular
of
Mr.
Jennings
's
last
illness
,
and
what
he
say
to
his
wife
a
few
minute
before
he
die
.
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
be
more
agreeable
than
her
mother
only
in
be
more
silent
.
<EOS>
Elinor
need
little
observation
to
perceive
that
her
reserve
be
a
mere
calmness
of
manner
with
which
sense
have
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
towards
her
husband
and
mother
she
be
the
same
as
to
them
;
and
intimacy
be
therefore
neither
to
be
look
for
nor
desire
.
<EOS>
She
have
nothing
to
say
one
day
that
she
have
not
say
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
Her
insipidity
be
invariable
,
for
even
her
spirit
be
always
the
same
;
and
though
she
do
not
oppose
the
party
arrange
by
her
husband
,
provide
every
thing
be
conduct
in
style
and
her
two
eld
child
attend
her
,
she
never
appear
to
receive
more
enjoyment
from
them
than
she
may
have
experience
in
sit
at
home
;
and
so
little
do
her
presence
add
to
the
pleasure
of
the
other
,
by
any
share
in
their
conversation
,
that
they
be
sometimes
only
remind
of
her
be
amongst
them
by
her
solicitude
about
her
troublesome
boy
.
  
<EOS>
in
Colonel
Brandon
alone
,
of
all
her
new
acquaintance
,
do
Elinor
find
a
person
who
could
in
any
degree
claim
the
respect
of
ability
,
excite
the
interest
of
friendship
,
or
give
pleasure
as
a
companion
.
<EOS>
Willoughby
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Her
admiration
and
regard
,
even
her
sisterly
regard
,
be
all
his
own
;
but
he
be
a
lover
;
his
attention
be
wholly
Marianne
's
,
and
a
far
less
agreeable
man
may
have
be
more
generally
pleasing
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Brandon
,
unfortunately
for
himself
,
have
no
such
encouragement
to
think
only
of
Marianne
,
and
in
converse
with
Elinor
he
find
the
great
consolation
for
the
indifference
of
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
's
compassion
for
him
increase
,
as
she
have
reason
to
suspect
that
the
misery
of
disappointed
love
have
already
be
know
to
him
.
<EOS>
this
suspicion
be
give
by
some
word
which
accidentally
drop
from
him
one
evening
at
the
park
,
when
they
be
sit
down
together
by
mutual
consent
,
while
the
other
be
dance
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
fix
on
Marianne
,
and
,
after
a
silence
of
some
minute
,
he
say
,
with
a
faint
smile
,
"
Your
sister
<EOS>
,
I
understand
,
do
not
approve
of
second
attachment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
Elinor
,
"
her
opinion
be
all
romantic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
or
rather
,
as
I
believe
,
she
consider
them
impossible
to
exist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
do
.
<EOS>
but
how
she
contrive
it
without
reflect
on
the
character
of
her
own
father
,
who
have
himself
two
wife
,
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
a
few
year
however
will
settle
her
opinion
on
the
reasonable
basis
of
common
sense
and
observation
;
and
then
they
may
be
more
easy
to
define
and
to
justify
than
they
now
be
,
by
any
body
but
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
will
probably
be
the
case
,
"
he
reply
;
"
and
yet
there
be
something
so
amiable
in
the
prejudice
of
a
young
mind
,
that
one
be
sorry
to
see
them
give
way
to
the
reception
of
more
general
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
agree
with
you
there
,
"
say
Elinor
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
inconvenience
attend
such
feeling
as
Marianne
's
,
which
all
the
charm
of
enthusiasm
and
ignorance
of
the
world
can
not
atone
for
.
<EOS>
Her
system
have
all
the
unfortunate
tendency
of
set
propriety
at
nought
;
and
a
well
acquaintance
with
the
world
be
what
I
look
forward
to
as
her
great
possible
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
he
resume
the
conversation
by
say
    
"
do
your
sister
make
no
distinction
in
her
objection
against
a
second
attachment

be
it
equally
criminal
in
every
body
?
<EOS>
be
those
who
have
be
disappoint
in
their
first
choice
,
whether
from
the
inconstancy
of
its
object
,
or
the
perverseness
of
circumstance

to
be
equally
indifferent
during
the
rest
of

life

"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
I
be
not
acquaint

the
minutiæ
of

principle

<EOS>
I
only
know
that
I
never

hear
her
admit
any
instance

a
second
attachment

be
pardonable

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
,
"
say
he
,
"
can
not
hold
;
but
a
change
,
a
total
change
of
sentiment
 
<EOS>
no

no

do
not
desire
it

for
when
the
romantic
refinement

oblige
to
give
way

how
frequently
be
they
succeed
by
such
opinion
as
be

too
common

and
too
dangerous

<EOS>
I
speak
from
experience

<EOS>
I
once
know
a
lady

in
temper
and
mind
greatly
resemble
your

who
think

like

an
enforced
change
 
from
a
series
of
unfortunate
circumstance

here
he
stop
suddenly
;
appear
to
think
that
he

too
much
,
and
by
his
countenance
give
rise
to
conjecture
,
which
may
not
otherwise
have
enter
Elinor
's
head
.
<EOS>
the
lady
would
probably
have
pass
without
suspicion
,
have
he
not
convince
Miss
Dashwood
that
what
concern
her
ought
not
to
escape
his
lip
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
it
require
but
a
slight
effort
of
fancy
to
connect
his
emotion
with
the
tender
recollection
of
past
regard
.
<EOS>
Elinor
attempt
no
more
.
<EOS>
but
Marianne
,
in
her
place
,
would
not
have
do
so
little
.
<EOS>
the
whole
story
would
have
be
speedily
form
under
her
active
imagination
;
and
every
thing
establish
in
the
most
melancholy
order
of
disastrous
love
.
    
<EOS>
as
Elinor
and
Marianne
be
walk
together
the
next
morning
the
latter
communicate
a
piece
of
news
to
her
sister
,
which
in
spite
of
all
that
she
know
before
of
Marianne
's
imprudence
and
want
of
thought
,
surprise
her
by
its
extravagant
testimony
of
both
.
<EOS>
Marianne
tell
her
,
with
the
great
delight
,
that
Willoughby
have
give
her
a
horse
,
one
that
he
have
breed
himself
on
his
estate
in
Somersetshire
,
and
which
be
exactly
calculate
to
carry
a
woman
.
<EOS>
without
consider
that
it
be
not
in
her
mother
's
plan
to
keep
any
horse
,
that
if
she
be
to
alter
her
resolution
in
favour
of
this
gift
,
she
must
buy
another
for
the
servant
,
and
keep
a
servant
to
ride
it
,
and
after
all
,
build
a
stable
to
receive
them
,
she
have
accept
the
present
without
hesitation
,
and
tell
her
sister
of
it
in
rapture
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
intend
to
send
his
groom
into
Somersetshire
immediately
for
it
,
"
she
add
,
"
and
when
it
arrive
we
will
ride
every
day
.
<EOS>
You
shall
share
its
use
with
me
.
<EOS>
imagine
to
yourself
,
my
dear
Elinor
,
the
delight
of
a
gallop
on
some
of
these
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
most
unwilling
be
she
to
awaken
from
such
a
dream
of
felicity
to
comprehend
all
the
unhappy
truth
which
attend
the
affair
;
and
for
some
time
she
refuse
to
submit
to
them
.
<EOS>
as
to
an
additional
servant
,
the
expense
would
be
a
trifle
;
Mamma
she
be
sure
would
never
object
to
it
;
and
any
horse
would
do
for
_
him
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
;
he
may
always
get
one
at
the
park
;
as
to
a
stable
,
the
mere
shed
would
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
Elinor
then
venture
to
doubt
the
propriety
of
her
receive
such
a
present
from
a
man
so
little
,
or
at
least
so
lately
known
to
her
.
<EOS>
this
be
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
mistaken
,
Elinor
,
"
say
she
warmly
,
"
in
supposing
<EOS>
I
know
very
little
of
Willoughby
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
know
him
long
indeed
,
but
I
be
much
better
acquaint
with
him
,
than
I
be
with
any
other
creature
in
the
world
,
except
yourself
and
mama
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
time
or
opportunity
that
be
to
determine
intimacy
;
it
be
disposition
alone
.
<EOS>
seven
year
would
be
insufficient
to
make
some
people
acquaint
with
each
other
,
and
seven
day
be
more
than
enough
for
other
.
<EOS>
I
should
hold
myself
guilty
of
great
impropriety
in
accept
a
horse
from
my
brother
,
than
from
Willoughby
.
<EOS>
of
John
I
know
very
little
,
though
we
have
live
together
for
year
;
but
of
Willoughby
my
judgment
have
long
be
form
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
think
it
wisest
to
touch
that
point
no
more
.
<EOS>
She
know
her
sister
's
temper
.
<EOS>
opposition
on
so
tender
a
subject
would
only
attach
her
the
more
to
her
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
but
by
an
appeal
to
her
affection
for
her
mother
,
by
represent
the
inconvenience
which
that
indulgent
mother
must
draw
on
herself
,
if
(
as
would
probably
be
the
case
)
<EOS>
she
consent
to
this
increase
of
establishment
,
Marianne
be
shortly
subdue
;
and
she
promise
not
to
tempt
her
mother
to
such
imprudent
kindness
by
mention
the
offer
,
and
to
tell
Willoughby
when
she
see
him
next
,
that
it
must
be
decline
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
faithful
to
her
word
;
and
when
Willoughby
call
at
the
cottage
,
the
same
day
,
Elinor
hear
her
express
her
disappointment
to
him
in
a
low
voice
,
on
be
oblige
to
forego
the
acceptance
of
his
present
.
<EOS>
the
reason
for
this
alteration
be
at
the
same
time
relate
,
and
they
be
such
as
to
make
further
entreaty
on
his
side
impossible
.
<EOS>
His
concern
however
be
very
apparent
;
and
after
express
it
with
earnestness
,
he
add
,
in
the
same
low
voice
,
"
<EOS>
but
,
Marianne
,
the
horse
be
still
yours
,
though
you
can
not
use
it
now
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
it
only
till
you
can
claim
it
.
<EOS>
when
you
leave
Barton
to
form
your
own
establishment
in
a
more
lasting
home
,
Queen
Mab
shall
receive
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
overhear
by
Miss
Dashwood
;
and
in
the
whole
of
the
sentence
,
in
his
manner
of
pronounce
it
,
and
in
his
address
her
sister
by
her
christian
name
alone
,
she
instantly
see
an
intimacy
so
decide
,
a
meaning
so
direct
,
as
mark
a
perfect
agreement
between
them
.
<EOS>
from
that
moment
she
doubt
not
of
their
be
engage
to
each
other
;
and
the
belief
of
it
create
no
other
surprise
than
that
she
,
or
any
of
their
friend
,
should
be
leave
by
temper
<EOS>
so
frank
,
to
discover
it
by
accident
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
relate
something
to
her
the
next
day
,
which
place
this
matter
in
a
still
clear
light
.
<EOS>
Willoughby
have
spend
the
precede
evening
with
them
,
and
Margaret
,
by
be
leave
some
time
in
the
parlour
with
only
him
and
Marianne
,
have
have
opportunity
for
observation
,
which
,
with
a
most
important
face
,
she
communicate
to
her
eld
sister
,
when
they
be
next
by
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Elinor
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
"
I
have
such
a
secret
to
tell
you
about
Marianne
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
will
be
married
to
Mr.
Willoughby
very
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
say
so
,
"
reply
Elinor
,
"
almost
every
day
since
they
first
meet
on
high
-
church
down
;
and
they
have
not
know
each
other
a
week
,
I
believe
,
before
you
be
certain
that
Marianne
wear
his
picture
round
her
neck
;
but
it
turn
out
to
be
only
the
miniature
of
our
great
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
indeed
this
be
quite
another
thing
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
they
will
be
marry
very
soon
,
for
he
have
get
a
lock
of
her
hair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
take
care
,
Margaret
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
only
the
hair
of
some
great
uncle
of
_
his
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
indeed
,
Elinor
,
it
be
Marianne
's
.
<EOS>
I
be
almost
sure
it
be
,
<EOS>
for
I
see
him
cut
it
off
.
<EOS>
last
night
after
tea
,
when
you
and
mama
go
out
of
the
room
,
they
be
whisper
and
talk
together
as
fast
as
could
be
,
and
he
seem
to
be
beg
something
of
her
,
and
presently
he
take
up
her
scissor
and
cut
off
a
long
lock
of
her
hair
,
for
it
be
all
tumble
down
her
back
;
and
he
kiss
it
,
and
fold
it
up
in
a
piece
of
white
paper
;
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
-
book
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
such
particular
,
state
on
such
authority
,
Elinor
could
not
withhold
her
credit
;
nor
be
she
dispose
to
it
,
for
the
circumstance
be
in
perfect
unison
with
what
she
have
hear
and
see
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
's
sagacity
be
not
always
display
in
a
way
<EOS>
so
satisfactory
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Jennings
attack
her
one
evening
at
the
park
,
to
give
the
name
of
the
young
man
who
be
Elinor
's
particular
favourite
,
which
have
be
long
a
matter
of
great
curiosity
to
her
,
Margaret
answer
by
look
at
her
sister
,
and
say
,
"
I
must
not
tell
,
may
I
,
Elinor
?
"
  
this
of
course
make
every
body
laugh
;
and
Elinor
try
to
laugh
too
.
<EOS>
but
the
effort
be
painful
.
<EOS>
She
be
convince
that
Margaret
have
fix
on
a
person
whose
name
she
could
not
bear
with
composure
to
become
a
stand
joke
with
Mrs.
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
feel
for
her
most
sincerely
;
but
she
do
more
harm
than
good
to
the
cause
,
by
turn
very
red
and
say
in
an
angry
manner
to
Margaret
    
<EOS>
"
remember
that
whatever
your
conjecture
may
be
,
you
have
no
right
to
repeat
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
have
any
conjecture
about
it
,
"
reply
Margaret
;
"
it
be
you
who
tell
me
of
it
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
increase
the
mirth
of
the
company
,
and
Margaret
be
eagerly
press
to
say
something
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
pray
,
Miss
Margaret
,
let
us
know
all
about
it
,
"
say
Mrs.
Jennings
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
gentleman
's
name
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
tell
,
madam
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
very
well
what
it
be
;
and
I
know
where
he
be
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
we
can
guess
where
he
be
;
at
his
own
house
at
Norland
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
curate
of
the
parish
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
_
that
_
he
be
not
.
<EOS>
He
be
of
no
profession
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Margaret
,
"
say
Marianne
with
great
warmth
,
"
you
know
that
all
this
be
an
invention
of
your
own
,
and
that
there
be
no
such
person
in
existence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
he
be
lately
dead
,
Marianne
,
for
I
be
sure
there
be
such
a
man
once
,
and
his
name
begin
with
an
F.
"
  
most
grateful
<EOS>
do
Elinor
feel
to
Lady
Middleton
for
observe
,
at
this
moment
,
"
that
it
rain
very
hard
,
"
though
she
believe
the
interruption
to
proceed
less
from
any
attention
to
her
,
than
from
her
ladyship
's
great
dislike
of
all
such
inelegant
subject
of
raillery
as
delight
her
husband
and
mother
.
<EOS>
the
idea
however
start
by
her
,
be
immediately
pursue
by
Colonel
Brandon
,
who
be
on
every
occasion
mindful
of
the
feeling
of
other
;
and
much
be
say
on
the
subject
of
rain
by
both
of
them
.
<EOS>
Willoughby
open
the
piano
-
forte
,
and
ask
Marianne
to
sit
down
to
it
;
and
thus
amidst
the
various
endeavour
of
different
people
to
quit
the
topic
,
it
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
but
not
so
easily
do
Elinor
recover
from
the
alarm
into
which
it
have
throw
her
.
  
<EOS>
a
party
be
form
this
evening
for
go
on
the
follow
day
to
see
a
very
fine
place
about
twelve
mile
from
Barton
,
belong
to
a
brother
-
in
-
law
of
Colonel
Brandon
,
without
whose
interest
it
could
not
be
see
,
as
the
proprietor
,
who
be
then
abroad
,
have
leave
strict
order
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
the
ground
be
declare
to
be
highly
beautiful
,
and
Sir
John
,
who
be
particularly
warm
in
their
praise
,
may
be
allow
to
be
a
tolerable
judge
,
for
he
have
form
party
to
visit
them
,
at
least
,
twice
every
summer
for
the
last
ten
year
.
<EOS>
They
contain
a
noble
piece
of
water
 
a
sail
on
which
be
to
a
form
a
great
part
of
the
morning
's
amusement
;
cold
provision
be
to
be
take
,
open
carriage
only
to
be
employ
,
and
every
thing
conduct
in
the
usual
style
of
a
complete
party
of
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
to
some
few
of
the
company
it
appear
rather
a
bold
undertaking
,
consider
the
time
of
year
,
and
that
it
have
rain
every
day
for
the
last
fortnight
;
and
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
who
have
already
a
cold
,
be
persuade
by
Elinor
to
stay
at
home
.
    
<EOS>
Their
intended
excursion
to
Whitwell
turn
out
very
different
from
what
Elinor
have
expect
.
<EOS>
She
be
prepared
to
be
wet
through
,
fatigue
,
and
frightened
;
but
the
event
be
still
more
unfortunate
,
for
they
do
not
go
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
by
ten
o'clock
the
whole
party
be
assemble
at
the
park
,
where
they
be
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
the
morning
be
rather
favourable
,
though
it
have
rain
all
night
,
as
the
cloud
be
then
disperse
across
the
sky
,
and
the
sun
frequently
appear
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
in
high
spirit
and
good
humour
,
eager
to
be
happy
,
and
determine
to
submit
to
the
great
inconvenience
and
hardship
rather
than
be
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
while
they
be
at
breakfast
the
letter
be
bring
in
.
<EOS>
among
the
rest
there
be
one
for
Colonel
Brandon
:
 
<EOS>
he
take
it
,
look
at
the
direction
,
change
colour
,
and
immediately
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
with
Brandon
?
"
say
Sir
John
.
  
<EOS>
nobody
could
tell
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
have
have
no
bad
news
,
"
say
Lady
Middleton
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
something
extraordinary
that
could
make
Colonel
Brandon
leave
my
breakfast
table
so
suddenly
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
about
five
minute
he
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
bad
news
,
Colonel
,
I
hope
;
"
say
Mrs.
Jennings
,
as
soon
as
he
enter
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
none
at
all
,
madam
,
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
from
Avignon
?
<EOS>
I
hope
it
be
not
to
say
that
your
sister
be
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
madam
.
<EOS>
It
come
from
town
,
and
be
merely
a
letter
of
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
come
the
hand
to
discompose
you
so
much
,
if
it
be
only
a
letter
of
business
?
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
this
will
not
do
,
Colonel
;
so
let
us
hear
the
truth
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
madam
,
"
say
Lady
Middleton
,
"
recollect
what
you
be
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
to
tell
you
that
your
cousin
Fanny
be
married
?
"
say
Mrs.
Jennings
,
without
attend

room

<EOS>
the
complaint

lamentation
which
politeness
have
hitherto
restrain

now
burst
forth
universally
;

they
all
agree
again

again
how
provoking
it
be
to
be
so
disappointed

<EOS>
"
I
can
guess
what
his
business
be
,
however
,
"

Mrs.
Jennings
exultingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
,
madam
?
"

almost
every
body

<EOS>

yes
;
it
be
about
Miss
Williams

I
be
sure

what
!

do
not
you
know
who
Miss
Williams
be

<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
must
have
hear
of
her
before

<EOS>
She
be
a
relation
of
the
Colonel
's
,
my
dear
;
a
very
near
relation
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
say
how
near

for
fear
of
shock
the
young
lady

then
,
lower
her
voice
a
little
,
she

to
Elinor

She
be
his
natural
daughter

indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes

as
like
him
as
she
can
stare

<EOS>
I
dare
say
the
Colonel
will
leave
her
all
his
fortune
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
Sir
John
return
,
he
join
most
heartily
in
the
general
regret
on
so
unfortunate
an
event
;
conclude
however
by
observe
,
that
as
they
be
all
get
together
,
they
must
do
something
by
way
of
be
happy
;
and
after
some
consultation
it
be
agree
,
that
although
happiness
could
only
be
enjoy
at
Whitwell
,
they
may
procure
a
tolerable
composure
of
mind
by
drive
about
the
country
.
<EOS>
the
carriage
be
then
order
;
Willoughby
's
be
first
,
and
Marianne
never
look
happy
than
when
she
get
into
it
.
<EOS>
He
drive
through
the
park
very
fast
,
and
they
be
soon
out
of
sight
;
and
nothing
more
of
them
be
see
till
their
return
,
which
do
not
happen
till
after
the
return
of
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
They
both
seem
delighted
with
their
drive
;
but
say
only
in
general
term
that
they
have
keep
in
the
lane
,
while
the
other
go
on
the
down
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
settle
that
there
should
be
a
dance
in
the
evening
,
and
that
every
body
should
be
extremely
merry
all
day
long
.
<EOS>
some
more
of
the
Careys
come
to
dinner
,
and
they
have
the
pleasure
of
sit
down
nearly
twenty
to
table
,
which
Sir
John
observe
with
great
contentment
.
<EOS>
Willoughby
take
his
usual
place
between
the
two
elder
Miss
Dashwoods
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
sit
on
Elinor
's
right
hand
;
and
they
have
not
be
long
seat
,
before
she
lean
behind
her
and
Willoughby
,
and
say
to
Marianne
,
loud
enough
for
them
both
to
hear
,
"
I
have
find
you
out
in
spite
of
all
your
trick
.
<EOS>
I
know
where
you
spend
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Marianne
colour
,
and
reply
very
hastily
,
"
where
,
pray
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
know
,
"
say
Willoughby
,
"
that
we
have
be
out
in
my
curricle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
Mr.
Impudence
,
I
know
that
very
well
,
and
I
be
determined
to
find
out
_
where
_
you
have
be
to
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
like
your
house
,
Miss
Marianne
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
large
one
,
I
know
;
and
when
I
come
to
see
you
,
I
hope
you
will
have
new
-
furnished
it
,
for
it
want
it
very
much
when
I
be
there
six
year
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Marianne
turn
away
in
great
confusion
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
laugh
heartily
;
and
Elinor
find
that
in
her
resolution
to
know
where
they
have
be
,
she
have
actually
make
her
own
woman
enquire
of
Mr.
Willoughby
's
groom
;
and
that
she
have
by
that
method
be
inform
that
they
have
go
to
Allenham
,
and
spend
a
considerable
time
there
in
walk
about
the
garden
and
go
all
over
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
could
hardly
believe
this
to
be
true
,
as
it
seem
very
unlikely
that
Willoughby
should
propose
,
or
Marianne
consent
,
to
enter
the
house
while
Mrs.
Smith
be
in
it
,
with
whom
Marianne
have
not
the
small
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
leave
the
dining
-
room
,
Elinor
enquire
of
her
about
it
;
and
great
be
her
surprise
when
she
find
that
every
circumstance
relate
by
Mrs.
Jennings
be
perfectly
true
.
<EOS>
Marianne
be
quite
angry
with
her
for
doubt
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
imagine
,
Elinor
,
that
we
do
not
go
there
,
or
that
we
do
not
see
the
house
?
<EOS>
be
not
it
what
you
have
often
wish
to
do
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Marianne
,
but
I
would
not
go
while
Mrs.
Smith
be
there
,
and
with
no
other
companion
than
Mr.
Willoughby
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Willoughby
however
be
the
only
person
who
can
have
a
right
to
show
that
house
;
and
as
he
go
in
an
open
carriage
,
it
be
impossible
to
have
any
other
companion
.
<EOS>
I
never
spend
a
pleasanter
morning
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
"
reply
Elinor
,
"
that
the
pleasantness
of
an
employment
do
not
always
evince
its
propriety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
,
nothing
can
be
a
strong
proof
of
it
,
Elinor
;
for
if
there
have
be
any
real
impropriety
in
what
I
do
,
I
should
have
be
sensible
of
it
at
the
time
,
for
we
always
know
when
we
be
act
wrong
,
and
with
such
a
conviction
I
could
have
have
no
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
dear
Marianne
,
as
it
have
already
expose
you
to
some
very
impertinent
remark
,
do
you
not
now
begin
to
doubt
the
discretion
of
your
own
conduct
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
the
impertinent
remark
of
Mrs.
Jennings
be
to
be
the
proof
of
impropriety
in
conduct
,
we
be
all
offend
every
moment
of
our
life
.
<EOS>
I
value
not
her
censure
any
more
than
I
should
do
her
commendation
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
sensible
of
have
do
anything
wrong
in
walk
over
Mrs.
Smith
's
ground
,
or
in
see
her
house
.
<EOS>
They
will
one
day
be
Mr.
Willoughby
's
,
and
 
"
  
"
if
they
be
one
day
to
be
your
own
,
Marianne
,
you
would
not
be
justify
in
what
you
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
blush
at
this
hint
;
but
it
be
even
visibly
gratify
to
her
;
and
after
a
ten
minute
'
interval
of
earnest
thought
,
she
come
to
her
sister
again
,
and
say
with
great
good
humour
,
"
<EOS>
perhaps
,
Elinor
,
it
_
be
_
rather
ill
-
judge
in
me
to
go
to
Allenham
;
but
Mr.
Willoughby
want
particularly
to
show
me
the
place
;
and
it
be
a
charming
house
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
remarkably
pretty
sit
room
up
stair
;
of
a
nice
comfortable
size
for
constant
use
,
and
with
modern
furniture
it
would
be
delightful
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
corner
room
,
and
have
window
on
two
side
.
<EOS>
on
one
side
you
look
across
the
bowling
-
green
,
behind
the
house
,
to
a
beautiful
hanging
wood
,
and
on
the
other
you
have
a
view
of
the
church
and
village
,
and
,
beyond
them
,
of
those
fine
bold
hill
that
we
have
so
often
admire
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
it
to
advantage
,
for
nothing
could
be
more
forlorn
than
the
furniture
;
but
if
it
be
newly
fit
up
 
a
couple
of
hundred
pound
,
Willoughby
say
,
would
make
it
one
of
the
pleasantest
summer
-
room
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Could
Elinor
have
listen
to
her
without
interruption
from
the
other
,
she
would
have
describe
every
room
in
the
house
with
equal
delight
.
    
<EOS>
the
sudden
termination
of
Colonel
Brandon
's
visit
at
the
park
,
with
his
steadiness
in
conceal
its
cause
,
fill
the
mind
,
and
raise
the
wonder
of
Mrs.
Jennings
for
two
or
three
day
;
she
be
a
great
wonderer
,
as
every
one
must
be
who
take
a
very
lively
interest
in
all
the
coming
and
going
of
all
their
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
She
wonder
,
with
little
intermission
what
could
be
the
reason
of
it
;
be
sure
there
must
be
some
bad
news
,
and
think
over
every
kind
of
distress
that
could
have
befall
him
,
with
a
fix
determination
that
he
should
not
escape
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
something
very
melancholy
must
be
the
matter
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
see
it
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
poor
man
!
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
his
circumstance
may
be
bad
.
<EOS>
the
estate
at
Delaford
be
never
reckon
more
than
two
thousand
a
year
,
and
his
brother
leave
everything
sadly
involved
.
<EOS>
I
do
think
he
must
have
be
send
for
about
money
matter
,
for
what
else
can
it
be
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
anything
to
know
the
truth
of
it
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
about
Miss
Williams
and
,
by
the
bye
,
I
dare
say
it
be
,
because
he
look
so
conscious
when
I
mention
her
.
<EOS>
May
be
she
be
ill
in
town
;
nothing
in
the
world
more
likely
,
for
I
have
a
notion
she
be
always
rather
sickly
.
<EOS>
I
would
lay
any
wager
it
be
about
Miss
Williams
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
very
likely
he
should
be
distress
in
his
circumstance
_
now
_
,
<EOS>
for
he
be
a
very
prudent
man
,
and
to
be
sure
must
have
clear
the
estate
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
it
can
be
!
<EOS>
May
be
his
sister
be
bad
at
Avignon
,
and
have
send
for
him
over
.
<EOS>
His
setting
off
in
such
a
hurry
seem
very
like
it
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
wish
him
out
of
all
his
trouble
with
all
my
heart
,
and
a
good
wife
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
wonder
,
so
talk
Mrs.
Jennings
.
<EOS>
Her
opinion
vary
with
every
fresh
conjecture
,
and
all
seem
equally
probable
as
they
arise
.
<EOS>
Elinor
,
though
she
feel
really
interested
in
the
welfare
of
Colonel
Brandon
,
could
not
bestow
all
the
wonder
on
his
go
so
suddenly
away
,
which
Mrs.
Jennings
be
desirous
of
her
feeling
;
for
besides
that
the
circumstance
do
not
in
her
opinion
justify
such
last
amazement
or
variety
of
speculation
,
her
wonder
be
otherwise
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
It
be
engross
by
the
extraordinary
silence
of
her
sister
and
Willoughby
on
the
subject
,
which
they
must
know
to
be
peculiarly
interesting
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
as
this
silence
continue
,
every
day
make
it
appear
more
strange
and
more
incompatible
with
the
disposition
of
both
.
<EOS>
why
they
should
not
openly
acknowledge
to
her
mother
and
herself
,
what
their
constant
behaviour
to
each
other
declare
to
have
take
place
,
Elinor
could
not
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
easily
conceive
that
marriage
may
not
be
immediately
in
their
power
;
for
though
Willoughby
be
independent
,
there
be
no
reason
to
believe
him
rich
.
<EOS>
His
estate
have
be
rate
by
Sir
John
at
about
six
or
seven
hundred
a
year
;
but
he
live
at
an
expense
to
which
that
income
could
hardly
be
equal
,
and
he
have
himself
often
complain
of
his
poverty
.
<EOS>
but
for
this
strange
kind
of
secrecy
maintain
by
them
relative
to
their
engagement
,
which
in
fact
conceal
nothing
at
all
,
she
could
not
account
;
and
it
be
so
wholly
contradictory
to
their
general
opinion
and
practice
,
that
a
doubt
sometimes
enter
her
mind
of
their
be
really
engage
,
and
this
doubt
be
enough
to
prevent
her
make
any
inquiry
of
Marianne
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
expressive
of
attachment
to
them
all
,
than
Willoughby
's
behaviour
.
<EOS>
to
Marianne
it
have
all
the
distinguish
tenderness
which
a
lover
's
heart
could
give
,
and
to
the
rest
of
the
family
it
be
the
affectionate
attention
of
a
son
and
a
brother
.
<EOS>
the
cottage
seem
to
be
consider
and
love
by
him
as
his
home
;
many
more
of
his
hour
be
spend
there
than
at
Allenham
;
and
if
no
general
engagement
collect
them
at
the
park
,
the
exercise
which
call
him
out
in
the
morning
be
almost
certain
of
end
there
,
where
the
rest
of
the
day
be
spend
by
himself
at
the
side
of
Marianne
,
and
by
his
favourite
pointer
at
her
foot
.
  
<EOS>
one
evening
in
particular
,
about
a
week
after
Colonel
Brandon
leave
the
country
,
his
heart
seem
more
than
usually
open
to
every
feeling
of
attachment
to
the
object
around
him
;
and
on
Mrs.
Dashwood
be
happen
to
mention
her
design
of
improve
the
cottage
in
the
spring
,
he
warmly
oppose
every
alteration
of
a
place
which
affection
have
establish
as
perfect
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
"
improve
this
dear
cottage
!
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
I
will
never
consent

.
<EOS>
not
a

to
its

,
not
an
inch
to
its
size
,
if
my
feeling
be
regard

"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not

alarm
,
"
say
Miss
Dashwood
,
"
nothing
of
the
kind
will
be
do
;
for
my
mother
will
never
have
money
enough
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
heartily
glad
of
it
,
"
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"
May
she
always
be
poor
,
if
she
can
employ
her
riches
no
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Willoughby
.
<EOS>
but
you
may
be
assure
that
I
would
not
sacrifice
one
sentiment
of
local
attachment
of
yours
,
or
of
any
one
whom
I
love
,
for
all
the
improvement
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
depend
upon
it
that
whatever
unemployed
sum
may
remain
,
when
I
make
up
my
account
in
the
spring
,
I
would
even
rather
lay
it
uselessly
by
than
dispose
of
it
in
a
manner
so
painful
to
you
.
<EOS>
but
be
you
really
so
attached
to
this
place
as
to
see
no
defect
in
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
me
it
be
faultless
.
<EOS>
nay
,
more
,
I
consider
it
as
the
only
form
of
building
in
which
happiness
be
attainable
,
and
be
I
rich
enough
I
would
instantly
pull
Combe
down
,
and
build
it
up
again
in
the
exact
plan
of
this
cottage
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
with
dark
narrow
stair
and
a
kitchen
that
smoke
,
I
suppose
,
"
say
Elinor
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
cry
he
in
the
same
eager
tone
,
"
with
all
and
every
thing
belong
to
it
 
in
no
one
convenience
or
inconvenience
about
it
,
should
the
least
variation
be
perceptible
.
<EOS>
then
,
and
then
only
,
under
such
a
roof
,
I
may
perhaps
be
as
happy
at
Combe
as
I
have
be
at
Barton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
flatter
myself
,
"
reply
Elinor
,
"
that
even
under
the
disadvantage
of
well
room
and
a
broad
staircase
,
you
will
hereafter
find
your
own
house
as
faultless
as
you
now
do
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
certainly
be
circumstance
,
"
say
Willoughby
,
"
which
may
greatly
endear
it
to
me
;
but
this
place
will
always
have
one
claim
of
my
affection
,
which
no
other
can
possibly
share
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
look
with
pleasure
at
Marianne
,
whose
fine
eye
be
fix
so
expressively
on
Willoughby
,
as
plainly
denote
how
well
she
understand
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
often
do
I
wish
,
"
add
he
,
"
when
I
be
at
Allenham
this
time
twelvemonth
,
that
Barton
cottage
be
inhabit
!
<EOS>
I
never
pass
within
view
of
it
without
admire
its
situation
,
and
grieve
that
no
one
should
live
in
it
.
<EOS>
how
little
do
I
then
think
that
the
very
first
news
I
should
hear
from
Mrs.
Smith
,
when
I
next
come
into
the
country
,
would
be
that
Barton
cottage
be
take
:
and
I
feel
an
immediate
satisfaction
and
interest
in
the
event
,
which
nothing
but
a
kind
of
prescience
of
what
happiness
I
should
experience
from
it
,
can
account
for
.
<EOS>
Must
it
not
have
be
so
,
Marianne
?
"
speak
to
her
in
a
lower
voice
.
<EOS>
then
continue
his
former
tone
,
he
say
,
"
<EOS>
and
yet
this
house
you
would
spoil
,
Mrs.
Dashwood
?
<EOS>
You
would
rob
it
of
its
simplicity
by
imaginary
improvement
!
<EOS>
and
this
dear
parlour
in
which
our
acquaintance
first
begin
,
and
in
which
so
many
happy
hour
have
be
since
spend
by
us
together
,
you
would
degrade
to
the
condition
of
a
common
entrance
,
and
every
body
would
be
eager
to
pass
through
the
room
which
have
hitherto
contain
within
itself
more
real
accommodation
and
comfort
than
any
other
apartment
of
the
handsome
dimension
in
the
world
could
possibly
afford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
again
assure
him
that
no
alteration
of
the
kind
should
be
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
good
woman

"
he
warmly
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
promise
make
me
easy

<EOS>
extend
it
a
little
farther

it
will

happy

<EOS>
tell
me
that

that
I
shall
ever
find
you

your
as
unchanged

that
you

always
consider
me

the
kindness

<EOS>
the
promise
be
readily
give
,
and
Willoughby
's
behaviour
during
the
whole
of
the
evening
declare
at
once
his
affection
and
happiness

<EOS>
"
Shall
we
see
you
tomorrow
to
dinner

say
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
when
he
be
leave
them

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
ask
you

on
Lady
Middleton

He
engage
to
be
with
them
by
four
o'clock

<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
visit
to
Lady
Middleton
take
place
the
next
day
,
and
two
of
her
daughter
go
with
her
;
but
Marianne
excuse
herself
from
be
of
the
party
,
under
some
trifle
pretext
of
employment
;
and
her
mother
,
who
conclude
that
a
promise
have
be
make
by
Willoughby
the
night
before
of
call
on
her
while
they
be
absent
,
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
her

at
home

<EOS>
on
their
return
from
the
park
they
find
Willoughby
's
curricle
and
servant
in
wait
at
the
cottage
,
and
Mrs.
Dashwood
be
convince
that
her
conjecture
have
be
just
.
<EOS>
so
far
it
be
all
as
she
have
foresee
;
but
on
enter
the
house
she
behold
what
no
foresight
have
teach
her
to
expect
.
<EOS>
They
be
no
sooner
in
the
passage
than
Marianne
come
hastily
out
of
the
parlour
apparently
in
violent
affliction
,
with
her
handkerchief
at
her
eye
;
and
without
notice
them
run
up
stair

<EOS>
surprised
and
alarm
<EOS>
they
proceed
directly
into
the
room
she

just
quit

where
they
find
only
Willoughby

who
be
lean
against
the
mantelpiece
with
his
back
towards
them

He
turn
round
on
their

his
countenance
show
that
he
strongly
partake
of
the
emotion

overpower

Mrs.

I

to
look
cheerful

with
a
force
smile
presently
add
,
"
It
be
I

disappointment

You

<EOS>
His
colour
increase
;
and
with
his
eye
fix
on
the
ground
<EOS>
he
only
reply
,

Mrs.

look
at
Elinor
with
surprise

Elinor
feel
equal
amazement

<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
every
one
be
silent

<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
first
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
to
add
,
my
dear
Willoughby
,
that
at
Barton
cottage
you
will
always
be
welcome
;
for
I
will
not
press
you
to
return
here
immediately
,
because
you
only
can
judge
how
far
_
that
_
may
be
pleasing
to
Mrs.
Smith
;
and
on
this
head
I
shall
be
no
more
disposed
to
question
your
judgment
than
to
doubt
your
inclination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
engagement
at
present

reply
Willoughby
,
confusedly
,
"
be
of
such
a
nature
 
that
 
I
dare
not
flatter
myself
 
<EOS>
"
  
He
stop
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
be
too
much
astonished
to
speak
,
and
another
pause
succeed
.
<EOS>
this
be
break
by
Willoughby
,
who
say
with
a
faint
smile
,
"
It
be
folly
to
linger
in
this
manner

<EOS>
I
will
not
torment
myself
any
longer
by
remain
among
friend
whose
society
it
be
impossible
for
me
now
to
enjoy

<EOS>
He
then
hastily
take
leave
of
them
all
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
They
see
him
step
into
his
carriage
,
and
in
a
minute
it
be
out
of
sight
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
feel
too
much
for
speech
,
and
instantly
quit
the
parlour
to
give
way
in
solitude
to
the
concern
and
alarm
which
this
sudden
departure
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
's
uneasiness
be
at
least
equal
to
her
mother
's
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
what
have
just
pass
with
anxiety
and
distrust
.
<EOS>
Willoughby
's
behaviour
in
take
leave
of
them
,
his
embarrassment
,
and
affectation
of
cheerfulness
,
and
,
above
all
,
his
unwillingness
to
accept
her
mother
's
invitation
 
a
backwardness
so
unlike
a
lover
,
so
unlike

greatly
disturb
her
.
<EOS>
one
moment
she
fear
that
no
serious
design
have
ever
be
form
on
his
side
;
and
the
next
that
some
unfortunate
quarrel
have
take
place
between
him
and
her
sister

<EOS>
the
distress
in
which
Marianne

quit
the
room
be
such
as
a
serious
quarrel
could
most
reasonably
account
for
,
though
when
she
consider
what
Marianne
's
love
for
him
be
,
a
quarrel
seem
almost
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
but
whatever
may
be
the
particular
of
their
separation
,
her
sister
's
affliction
be
indubitable
;
and
she
think
with
the
tender
compassion
of
that
violent
sorrow
which
Marianne
be
in
all
probability
not
merely
give
way
to
as
a
relief
,
but
feeding
and
encouraging
as
a
duty
.
  
<EOS>
in
about
half
an
hour
her
mother
return
,
and
though
her
eye
be
red
,
her
countenance
be
not
uncheerful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
dear
Willoughby
be
now
some
mile
from
Barton
,
Elinor
,
"
say
she
,
as
she
sit
down
to
work
,
"
and
with
how
heavy
a
heart
do
he
travel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
very
strange
.
<EOS>
so
suddenly
to
be
go
!
<EOS>
It
seem
but
the
work
of
a
moment
.
<EOS>
and
last
night
he
be
with
us
so
happy
,
so
cheerful
,
so
affectionate
?
<EOS>
and
now
,
after
only
ten
minute
notice
,
 
go
too
without
intend
to
return
!
<EOS>
something
more
than
what
he
own
to
us
must
have
happen
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
speak
,
he
do
not
behave
like
himself
.
<EOS>
_
You
_
must
have
see
the
difference
as
well
as
I.
<EOS>
what
can
it
be
?
<EOS>
Can
they
have
quarrel
?
<EOS>
why
else
should
he
have
show
such
unwillingness
to
accept
your
invitation
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
inclination
that
he
want
,
Elinor
;
I
could
plainly
see
_
that
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
have
not
the
power
of
accept
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
it
all
over
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
and
I
can
perfectly
account
for
every
thing
that
at
first
seem
strange
to
me
as
well
as
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
,
indeed
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
have
explain
it
to
myself
in
the
most
satisfactory
way
;
but
<EOS>
you
,
Elinor
,
who
love
to
doubt
where
you
can
 
it
will
not
satisfy
_
you
_
,
I
know
;
but
you
shall
not
talk
_
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
_
out
of
my
trust
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
that
Mrs.
Smith
suspect
his
regard
for
Marianne
,
disapprove
of
it
,
(
perhaps
because
she
have
other
view
for
him
,
)
and
on
that
account
be
eager
to
get
him
away
;
and
that
the
business
which
she
send
him
off
to
transact
be
invent
as
an
excuse
to
dismiss
him
.
<EOS>
this
be
what
I
believe
to
have
happen
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
moreover
,
aware
<EOS>
that
she
_
do
_
disapprove
the
connection
,
he
dare
not
therefore
at
present
confess
to
her
his
engagement
with
Marianne
,
and
he
feel
himself
oblige
,
from
his
dependent
situation
,
to
give
into
her
scheme
,
and
absent
himself
from
Devonshire
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
You
will
tell
me
,
I
know
,
that
this
may
or
may
_
not
_
have
happen
;
but
I
will
listen
to
no
cavil
,
unless
you
can
point
out
any
other
method
of
understand
the
affair
as
satisfactory
at
this
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
Elinor
,
what
have
you
to
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
for
you
have
anticipate
my
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
would
have
tell
me
,
that
it
may
or
may
not
have
happen
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Elinor
,
how
incomprehensible
be
your
feeling
!
<EOS>
You
have
rather
take
evil
upon
credit
than
good
.
<EOS>
You
have
rather
look
out
for
misery
for
Marianne
,
and
guilt
for
poor
Willoughby
,
than
an
apology
for
the
latter
.
<EOS>
You
be
resolve
to
think
him
blamable
,
because
he
take
leave
of
us
with
less
affection
than
his
usual
behaviour
have
show
.
<EOS>
and
be
no
allowance
to
be
make
for
inadvertence
,
or
for
spirit
depress
by
recent
disappointment
?
<EOS>
be
no
probability
to
be
accept
,
merely
because
they
be
not
certainty
?
<EOS>
be
nothing
due
to
the
man
whom
we
have
all
such
reason
to
love
,
and
no
reason
in
the
world
to
think
ill
of
?
 
<EOS>
to
the
possibility
of
motive
unanswerable
in
themselves
,
though
unavoidably
secret
for
a
while
?
<EOS>
and
,
after
all
,
what
be
it
<EOS>
you
suspect
him
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
tell
myself
.
<EOS>
but
suspicion
of
something
unpleasant
be
the
inevitable
consequence
of
such
an
alteration
as
we
just
witness
in
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
great
truth
,
however
,
in
what
you
have
now
urge
of
the
allowance
which
ought
to
be
make
for
him
,
and
it
be
my
wish
to
be
candid
in
my
judgment
of
every
body
.
<EOS>
Willoughby
may
undoubtedly
have
very
sufficient
reason
for
his
conduct
,
and
I
will
hope
that
he
have
.
<EOS>
but
it
would
have
be
more
like
Willoughby
to
acknowledge
them
at
once
.
<EOS>
Secrecy
may
be
advisable
;
but
still
I
can
not
help
wonder
at
its
be
practice
by
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
blame
him
,
however
,
for
depart
from
his
character
,
where
the
deviation
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
but
you
really
do
admit
the
justice
of
what
I
have
say
in
his
defence
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
happy
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
acquit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
entirely
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
proper
to
conceal
their
engagement
(
if
they
_
be
_
engage
)
from
Mrs.
Smith
;
and
if
that
be
the
case
,
it
must
be
highly
expedient
for
Willoughby
to
be
but
little
in
Devonshire
at
present
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
no
excuse
for
their
conceal
it
from
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
conceal
it
from
us
!
<EOS>
my
dear
child
,
do
you
accuse
Willoughby
and
Marianne
of
concealment
?
<EOS>
this
be
strange
indeed
,
when
your
eye
have
be
reproach
them
every
day
for
incautiousness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
no
proof
of
their
affection
,
"
say
Elinor
;
"
but
of
their
engagement
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
perfectly
satisfied
of
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yet
not
a
syllable
have
be
say
to
you
on
the
subject
,
by
either
of
them

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
want
syllable
where
action
have
speak
so
plainly
.
<EOS>
have
not
his
behaviour
to
Marianne
and
to
all
of
us
,
for
at
least
the
last
fortnight
,
declare
that
he
love
and
consider
her
as
his
future
wife
,
and
that
he
feel
for
us
the
attachment
of
the
near
relation
?
<EOS>
have
we
not
perfectly
understand
each
other
?
<EOS>
have
not
my
consent
be
daily
ask
by
his
look
,
his
manner
,
his
attentive
and
affectionate
respect
?
<EOS>
My
Elinor
,
be
it
possible
to
doubt
their
engagement
?
<EOS>
how
could
such
a
thought
occur
to
you
?
<EOS>
how
be
it
to
be
suppose
that
Willoughby
,
persuade
as
he
must
be
of
your
sister
's
love
,
should
leave
her
,
and
leave
her
perhaps
for
month
,
without
tell
her
of
his
affection
,
 
that
they
should
part
without
a
mutual
exchange
of
confidence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
confess
,
"
reply
Elinor
,
"
that
every
circumstance
except
_
one
<EOS>
_
be
in
favour
of
their
engagement
;
but
that
_
one
<EOS>
_
be
the
total
silence
of
both
on
the
subject
,
and
with
me
it
almost
outweigh
every
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
strange
this
be
!
<EOS>
You
must
think
wretchedly
indeed
of
Willoughby
,
if
,
after
all
that
have
openly
pass
between
them
,
you
can
doubt
the
nature
of
the
term
on
which
they
be
together
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
act
a
part
in
his
behaviour
to
your
sister
all
this
time
?
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
him
really
indifferent
to
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
can
not
think
that
.
<EOS>
He
must
and
do
love
her
<EOS>
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
with
a
strange
kind
of
tenderness
,
if
he
can
leave
her
with
such
indifference
,
such
carelessness
of
the
future
,
as
you
attribute
to
him
.
"
  
"
You
must
remember
,
my
dear
mother
,
that
I
have
never
consider
this
matter
as
certain
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
my
doubt
,
I
confess
;
but
they
be
fainter
than
they
be
,
and
they
may
soon
be
entirely
do
away
.
<EOS>
if
we
find
they
correspond
,
every
fear
of
mine
will
be
remove

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
mighty
concession
indeed
!
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
see
them
at
the
altar
,
you
would
suppose
they
be
go
to
be
marry
.
<EOS>
ungracious
girl
!
<EOS>
but
I
require
no
such
proof

<EOS>
nothing
in
my
opinion
have
ever
pass
to
justify
doubt
;
no
secrecy
have
be
attempt
;
all
have
be
uniformly
open
and
unreserved
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
doubt
your
sister
's
wish

<EOS>
It
must
be
Willoughby
therefore
whom
you
suspect
.
<EOS>
but
why
?
<EOS>
be
he
not
a
man
of
honour
and
feeling
?
<EOS>
have
there
be
any
inconsistency
on
his
side
to
create
alarm
?
<EOS>
can
he
be
deceitful
?

<EOS>
"
I
hope
not

I
believe
not

cry
Elinor

<EOS>
"
I
love
Willoughby
,
sincerely
love
him
;
and
suspicion
of
his
integrity
can
not
be
more
painful
to
yourself
than
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
involuntary
,
and
I
will
not
encourage
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
startled
,
I
confess
,
by
the
alteration
in
his
manner
this
morning
;
he
do
not
speak
like
himself
,
and
do
not
return
your
kindness
with
any
cordiality
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
may
be
explain
by
such
a
situation
of
his
affair
as
you
have
suppose
.
<EOS>
He
have
just
part
from
my
sister
,
have
see
her
leave
him
in
the
great
affliction
;
and
if
he
feel
oblige
,
from
a
fear
of
offend
Mrs.
Smith
,
to
resist
the
temptation
of
return
here
soon
,
and
yet
aware
that
by
decline
your
invitation
,
by
say
that
he
be
go
away
for
some
time
,
he
should
seem
to
act
an
ungenerous
,
a
suspicious
part
by
our
family
,
he
may
well
be
embarrassed
and
disturb
.
<EOS>
in
such
a
case
,
a
plain
and
open
avowal
of
his
difficulty
would
have
be
more
to
his
honour
<EOS>
I
think
,
as
well
as
more
consistent
with
his
general
character
;
 
but
I
will
not
raise
objection
against
any
one
's
conduct
on
so
illiberal
a
foundation
,
as
a
difference
in
judgment
from
myself
,
or
a
deviation
from
what
I
may
think
right
and
consistent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
very
properly
.
<EOS>
Willoughby
certainly
do
not
deserve
to
be
suspect
.
<EOS>
though
_
we
_
have
not
know
him
long
,
he
be
no
stranger
in
this
part
of
the
world

and
who
have
ever
speak
to
his
disadvantage

<EOS>
have
he
be
in
a
situation
to
act
independently
and
marry
immediately
<EOS>
,
it
may
have
be
odd
that
he
should
leave
us
without
acknowledge
everything
to
me
at
once
:
but
this
be
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
engagement
in
some
respect
not
prosperously
begin
,
for
their
marriage
must
be
at
a
very
uncertain
distance
;
and
even
secrecy
,
as
far
as
it
can
be
observe
,
may
now
be
very
advisable
.

"
  
<EOS>
They
be
interrupt
by
the
entrance
of
Margaret
;
and
Elinor
be
then
at
liberty
to
think
over
the
representation
of
her
mother
,
to
acknowledge
the
probability
of
many
,
and
hope
for
the
justice
of
all

<EOS>
They
see
nothing
of
Marianne
till
dinner
time
,
when
she
enter
the
room
and
take
her
place
at
the
table
without
say
a
word
.

Her
eye
be
red
and
swollen
;
and
it
seem
as
if
her
tear
be
even
then
restrain
with
difficulty

<EOS>
She
avoid
the
look
of
them
all
,
could
neither
eat
nor
speak
,
and
after
some
time
,
on
her
mother
's
silently
press
her
hand
with
tender
compassion
,
her
small
degree
of
fortitude
be
quite
overcome
,
she
burst
into
tear
and
leave
the
room

<EOS>
this
violent
oppression
of
spirit
continue
the
whole
evening
.
<EOS>
She
be
without
any
power
,
because
she
be
without
any
desire
of
command
over
herself
.
<EOS>
the
slight
mention
of
anything
relative
to
Willoughby
overpower
her
in
an
instant
;
and
though
her
family
be
most
anxiously
attentive
to
her
comfort
,
it
be
impossible
for
them
,
if
they
speak
at
all
,
to
keep
clear
of
every
subject
which
her
feeling
connect
with
him

<EOS>
Marianne
would
have
think
herself
very
inexcusable
<EOS>
have
she
be
able
to
sleep
at
all
the
first
night
after
part
from
Willoughby
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
be
ashamed
to
look
her
family
in
the
face
the
next
morning
,
<EOS>
have
she
not
rise
from
her
bed
in
more
need
of
repose
than
when
she
lie
down
in
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
feeling
which
make
such
composure
a
disgrace
,
leave
her
in
no
danger
of
incur
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
awake
the
whole
night
,
and
she
weep
the
great
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
get
up
with
a
headache
,
be
unable
to
talk
,
and
unwilling
to
take
any
nourishment
;
give
pain
every
moment
to
her
mother
and
sister
,
and
forbid
all
attempt
at
consolation
from
either
.
<EOS>
Her
sensibility
be
potent
enough
!
  
<EOS>
when
breakfast
be
over
she
walk
out
by
herself
,
and
wander
about
the
village
of
Allenham
,
indulge
the
recollection
of
past
enjoyment
and
cry
over
the
present
reverse
for
the
chief
of
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
pass
off
in
the
equal
indulgence
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
play
over
every
favourite
song
that
she
have
be
use
to
play
to
Willoughby
,
every
air
in
which
their
voice
have
be
oftenest
join
,
and
sit
at
the
instrument
gaze
on
every
line
of
music
that
he
have
write
out
for
her
,
till
her
heart
be
so
heavy
that
no
farther
sadness
could
be
gain
;
and
this
nourishment
of
grief
be
every
day
apply
.
<EOS>
She
spend
whole
hour
at
the
pianoforte
alternately
singe
and
cry
;
her
voice
often
totally
suspend
by
her
tear
.
<EOS>
in
book
too
,
as
well
as
in
music
,
she
court
the
misery
which
a
contrast
between
the
past
and
present
be
certain
of
give
.

She

nothing

what
they
have
be
use
to
read
together
.
  
<EOS>
such
violence
of
affliction
indeed
could
not
be
support
for
ever
;
it
sink
within
a
few
day
into
a
calm
melancholy
;
but
these
employment
,
to
which
she
daily
recur
,
her
solitary
walk
and
silent
meditation
,
still
produce
occasional
effusion
of
sorrow
as
lively
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
no
letter
from
Willoughby
come
;
and
none
seem
expect
by
Marianne
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
surprised
,
and
Elinor
again
become
uneasy
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Dashwood
could
find
explanation
whenever
she
want
them
,
which
at
least
satisfy
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
remember
,
Elinor
,
"
say
she
,
"
how
very
often
Sir
John
fetch
our
letter
himself
from
the
post
,
and
carry
them
to
it
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
agree
that
secrecy
may
be
necessary
,
and
we
must
acknowledge
that
it
could
not
be
maintain
if
their
correspondence
be
to
pass
through
Sir
John
's
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
could
not
deny
the
truth
of
this
,
and
she
try
to
find
in
it
a
motive
sufficient
for
their
silence
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
method
so
direct
,
so
simple
,
and
in
her
opinion
so
eligible
of
know
the
real
state
of
the
affair
,
and
of
instantly
remove
all
mystery
,
that
she
could
not
help
suggest
it
to
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
not
ask
Marianne
at
once
,
"
say
she
,
"
whether
she
be
or
she
be
not
engage
to
Willoughby
?
<EOS>
from
you
,
her
mother
,
and
so
kind
,
so
indulgent
a
mother
,
the
question
could
not
give
offence
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
the
natural
result
of
your
affection
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
use
to
be
all
unreserve
,
and
to
you
more
especially
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
ask
such
a
question
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
suppose
it
possible
that
they
be
not
engage
,
what
distress
would
not
such
an
enquiry
inflict
!
<EOS>
at
any
rate
it
would
be
most
ungenerous
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
deserve
her
confidence
again
,
after
force
from
her
a
confession
of
what
be
mean
at
present
to
be
unacknowledged
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
know
Marianne
's
heart
:
I
know
that
she
dearly
love
me
,
and
that
I
shall
not
be
the
last
to
whom
the
affair
be
make
known
,
when
circumstance
make
the
revealment
of
it
eligible
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
attempt
to
force
the
confidence
of
any
one
;
of
a
child
much
less
;
because
a
sense
of
duty
would
prevent
the
denial
which
her
wish
may
direct
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
think
this
generosity
overstrain
,
consider
her
sister
's
youth
,
and
urge
the
matter
farther
,
but
in
vain
;
common
sense
,
common
care
,
common
prudence
,
be
all
sink
in
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
romantic
delicacy
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
several
day
before
Willoughby
's
name
be
mention
before
Marianne
by
any
of
her
family
;
Sir
John
and
Mrs.
Jennings
,
indeed
,
be
not
so
nice
;
their
witticism
add
pain
to
many
a
painful
hour
;
but
one
evening
,
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
accidentally
take
up
a
volume
of
Shakespeare
,
exclaim
    
<EOS>
"
We
have
never

Marianne

go
away
before
we
could

through
it
.
<EOS>
We
will
put
it
by
,
that
when
he
come
again
 
;

it
may
be
month
,
perhaps
,
before
_

month

cry
Marianne
,
with
strong
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
no
 
nor
many
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
be
sorry
for
what
she
have
say
;
but
it
give
Elinor
pleasure
,
as
it
produce
a
reply
from
Marianne
so
expressive
of
confidence
in
Willoughby
and
knowledge
of
his
intention
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
,
about
a
week
after
his
leave
the
country
,
Marianne
be
prevail
on
to
join
her
sister
in
their
usual
walk
,
instead
of
wander
away
by
herself
.
<EOS>
hitherto
she
have
carefully
avoid
every
companion
in
her
ramble
.
<EOS>
if
her
sister
intend
to
walk
on
the
down
,
she
directly
steal
away
towards
the
lane
;
if
they
talk
of
the
valley
,
she
be
as
speedy
in
climb
the
hill
,
and
could
never
be
find
when
the
other
set
off
.
<EOS>
but
at
length
she
be
secure
by
the
exertion
of
Elinor
,
who
greatly
disapprove
such
continual
seclusion
.
<EOS>
They
walk
along
the
road
through
the
valley
,
and
chiefly
in
silence
,
for
Marianne
's
_
mind
_
could
not
be
control
,
and
Elinor
,
satisfied
with
gain
one
point
,
would
not
then
attempt
more
.
<EOS>
beyond
the
entrance
of
the
valley
,
where
the
country
,
though
still
rich
,
be
less
wild
and
more
open
,
a
long
stretch
of
the
road
which
they
have
travel
on
first
come
to
Barton
,
lie
before
them
;
and
on
reach
that
point
,
they
stop
to
look
around
them
,
and
examine
a
prospect
which
form
the
distance
of
their
view
from
the
cottage
,
from
a
spot
which
they
have
never
happen
to
reach
in
any
of
their
walk
before
.
  
<EOS>
amongst
the
object
in
the
scene
,
they
soon
discover
an
animated
one
;
it
be
a
man
on
horseback
ride
towards
them
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
they
could
distinguish
him
to
be
a
gentleman
;
and
in
a
moment
afterwards
Marianne
rapturously
exclaim
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
he
;
it
be
indeed
 
I
know
it
be
!
"
and
be
hasten
to
meet
him
,
when
Elinor
cry
out
    
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
Marianne
,
I
think
you
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
Willoughby
.
<EOS>
the
person
be
not
tall
enough
for
him
,
and
have
not
his
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
,
he
have
,
"
cry
Marianne
,
"
I
be
sure
he
have
.
<EOS>
His
air
,
his
coat
,
his
horse
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
soon
he
would
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
walk
eagerly
on
as
she
speak
;
and
Elinor
,
to
screen
Marianne
from
particularity
,
as
she
feel
almost
certain
of
its
not
be
Willoughby
,
quicken
her
pace
and
keep
up
with
her
.
<EOS>
They
be
soon
within
thirty
yard
of
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Marianne
look
again
;
her
heart
sink
within
her
;
and
abruptly
turn
round
,
she
be
hurry
back
,
when
the
voice
of
both
her
sister
be
raise
to
detain
her
;
a
third
,
almost
as
well
know
as
Willoughby
's
,
join
them
in
beg
her
to
stop
,
and
she
turn
round
with
surprise
to
see
and
welcome
Edward
Ferrars
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
could
at
that
moment
be
forgive
for
not
be
Willoughby
;
the
only
one
who
could
have
gain
a
smile
from
her
;
but
she
disperse
her
tear
to
smile
on
_
him
_
,
and
in
her
sister
's
happiness
forget
for
a
time
her
own
disappointment
.
  
<EOS>
He
dismount
,
and
give
his
horse
to
his
servant
,
walk
back
with
them
to
Barton
,
whither
he
be
purposely
come
to
visit
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
welcome
by
them
all
with
great
cordiality
,
but
especially
by
Marianne
,
who
show
more
warmth
of
regard
in
her
reception
of
him
than
even
Elinor
herself
.
<EOS>
to
Marianne
,
indeed
,
the
meeting
between
Edward
and
her
sister
be
but
a
continuation
of
that
unaccountable
coldness
which
she
have
often
observe
at
Norland
in
their
mutual
behaviour
.
<EOS>
on
Edward
's
side
,
more
particularly
,
there
be
a
deficiency
of
all
that
a
lover
ought
to
look
and
say
on
such
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
be
confused
,
seem
scarcely
sensible
of
pleasure
in
see
them
,
look
neither
rapturous
nor
gay
,
say
little
but
what
be
force
from
him
by
question
,
and
distinguished
Elinor
by
no
mark
of
affection
.
<EOS>
Marianne
see
and
listen
with
increase
surprise
.
<EOS>
She
begin
almost
to
feel
a
dislike
of
Edward
;
and
it
end
,
as
every
feeling
must
end
with
her
,
by
carry
back
her
thought
to
Willoughby
,
whose
manner
form
a
contrast
sufficiently
strike
to
those
of
his
brother
elect
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
silence
which
succeed
the
first
surprise
and
enquiry
of
meeting
,
Marianne
ask
Edward
if
he
come
directly
from
London
.
<EOS>
no
,
he
have
be
in
Devonshire
a
fortnight
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
fortnight
!
<EOS>
"
she
repeat
,
surprised
at
his
be
so
long
in
the
same
county
with
Elinor
without
see
her
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
rather
distressed
as
he
add
,
that
he
have
be
stay
with
some
friend
near
Plymouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
be
lately
in
Sussex
?
"
say
Elinor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
at
Norland
about
a
month
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
do
dear
,
dear
Norland
look
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Marianne
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
,
dear
Norland
,
"
say
Elinor
,
"
probably
look
much
as
it
always
do
at
this
time
of
the
year
 
the
wood

walk
thickly
cover
with
dead
leave

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

cry
Marianne
,
"
with
what
transport

I
formerly

how

I

as
I

what

the
season

the
air
altogether
inspire

<EOS>
now
there
be
no

them

They
be

only
as

sweep
hastily
off

drive
as
much
as
possible
from
the
sight

<EOS>
"
It
be
not

Elinor

who
have
your
passion
for
dead
leave

"
  
<EOS>

no

<EOS>
as
she
say
this
,
she
sink
into
a
reverie
for
a
few
moment
;
but
rouse
herself
again
,
"
now
,
Edward
,
"
say
she
,
call
his
attention
to
the
prospect
,
"
here
be
Barton

<EOS>
look
up
to
it

be
tranquil

do
you
ever

their
equal

<EOS>
to
the

be
Barton
park
,
amongst
those
wood
and
plantation

<EOS>
You
may
see
the
end
of
the
house

and
there

beneath

<EOS>
"
It
be

he
reply
;

but
these

must
be
dirty

<EOS>
"
how
can
you

dirt

with
such
object

because

reply
he
,
smile
,
"
among
the
rest
of
the

I
see
a
very
dirty
lane

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
strange

"
say
Marianne
to
herself
as
she
walk
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
an
agreeable

pleasant
people

"
no

how

They
be
a

respectable
family

Mr.
Ferrars

towards
us
have
behave
in
the

<EOS>
have
you

Marianne

how
many
pleasant
day
we
have
owe

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Marianne
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
nor
how
many
painful
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
take
no
notice
of
this
;
and
direct
her
attention
to
their
visitor
,
endeavour
to
support
something
like
discourse
with
him
,
by
talk
of
their
present
residence
,
its
convenience
,
&
c.
extort
from
him
occasional
question
and
remark
.
<EOS>
His
coldness
and
reserve
mortify
her
severely
;
she
be
vexed
and
half
angry
;
but
resolve
to
regulate
her
behaviour
to
him
by
the
past
rather
than
the
present
,
she
avoid
every
appearance
of
resentment
or
displeasure
,
and
treat
him
as
she
think
he
ought
to
be
treat
from
the
family
connection
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
be
surprise
only
for
a
moment
at
see
him
;
for
his
come
to
Barton
be
,
in
her
opinion
,
of
all
thing
the
most
natural
.
<EOS>
Her
joy
and
expression
of
regard
long
outlive
her
wonder
.
<EOS>
He
receive
the
kind
welcome
from
her
;
and
shyness
,
coldness
,
reserve
could
not
stand
against
such
a
reception
.
<EOS>
They
have
begin
to
fail
him
before
he
enter
the
house
,
and
they
be
quite
overcome
by
the
captivate
manner
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
.
<EOS>
indeed
a
man
could
not
very
well
be
in
love
with
either
of
her
daughter
,
without
extend
the
passion
to
her
;
and
Elinor
have
the
satisfaction
of
see
him
soon
become
more
like
himself
.
<EOS>
His
affection
seem
to
reanimate
towards
them
all
,
and
his
interest
in
their
welfare
again
become
perceptible
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
in
spirit
,
however
;
he
praise
their
house
,
admire
its
prospect
,
be
attentive
,
and
kind
;
but
still
he
be
not
in
spirit
.
<EOS>
the
whole
family
perceive
it
,
and
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
attribute
it
to
some
want
of
liberality
in
his
mother
,
sit
down
to
table
indignant
against
all
selfish
parent
.
  
<EOS>
"
what

Mrs.
Ferrars
's
view
for
you

say
she
,
when

Thomson

no

at

<EOS>

I
have
frequently

myself

kind

Elinor
,
"
in
a
total
misapprehension
of
character
in
some
point

other

fancy
people
so
much
more

ingenious

I
can
hardly

sometimes
one
be
guide
by

say

very

other
people
say
of
them

without
give
oneself
time

deliberate

Elinor

Marianne

to
be
guide
wholly
by
the
opinion

other

<EOS>
I
think
our
judgment

give
us
merely

subservient

no

all

guilty

I
confess

of
have
often
wish
you

great
attention

you

My
judgment

all
on

side

question

I
be
afraid
my
practice

much
more
on
your
sister

<EOS>
I
never

to
offend

I
be
so
foolishly
shy

that
I
often
seem
negligent

only
keep
back
by
my
natural
awkwardness

I
have
frequently
think
that
I
must
have
be
intend
by
nature

be
fond

low
company

I

so
little

Edward

shyness

only
the
effect

off

<EOS>
Edward
make
no
answer

<EOS>
His
gravity
and
thoughtfulness
return
on
him
in
their
full
extent
 
and
he
sit
for
some
time
silent
and
dull
.
    
<EOS>
Elinor
see
,
with
great
uneasiness
the
low
spirit
of
her
friend
.
<EOS>
His
visit
afford
her
but
a
very
partial
satisfaction
,
while
his
own
enjoyment
in
it
appear
so
imperfect
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
he
be
unhappy
;
she
wish
it
be
equally
evident
that
he
still
distinguish
her
by
the
same
affection
which
once
she
have
feel
no
doubt
of
inspire
;
but
hitherto
the
continuance
of
his
preference
seem
very
uncertain
;
and
the
reservedness
of
his
manner
towards
her
contradict
one
moment
what
a
more
animated
look
have
intimate
the
precede
one
.
  
<EOS>
He
join
her
and
Marianne
in
the
breakfast
-
room
the
next
morning
before
the
other
be
down
;
and
Marianne
,
who
be
always
eager
to
promote
their
happiness
as
far
as
she
could
,
soon
leave
them
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
but
before
she
be
half
way
upstairs
she
hear
the
parlour
door
open
,
and
,
turn
round
,
be
astonish
to
see
Edward
himself
come
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
into
the
village
to
see
my
horse
,
"
say
he
,
"
as
you

not
yet
ready
for
breakfast
;
I
shall
be
back
again
presently

"
     
<EOS>
Edward
return
to
them
with
fresh
admiration
of
the
surround
country
;
in
his
walk
to
the
village
,
he
have
see
many
part
of
the
valley
to
advantage
;
and
the
village
itself
,
in
a
much
high
situation
than
the
cottage
,
afford
a
general
view
of
the
whole
,
which
have
exceedingly
please
him
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
subject
which
ensure
Marianne
's
attention
,
and
she
be
begin
to
describe
her
own
admiration
of
these
scene
,
and
to
question
him
more
minutely
on
the
object
that
have
particularly
strike
him
,
when
Edward
interrupt
her
by
say
,
"
You
must
not
enquire
too
far
,
Marianne
<EOS>
:
remember
I
have
no
knowledge
in
the
picturesque
,
and
I
shall
offend
you
by
my
ignorance
and
want
of
taste
if
we
come
to
particular
.
<EOS>
I
shall
call
hills
steep
,
which
ought
to
be
bold
;
surface
strange
and
uncouth
,
which
ought
to
be
irregular
and
rugged
;
and
distant
object
out
of
sight
,
which
ought
only
to
be
indistinct
through
the
soft
medium
of
a
hazy
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
satisfied
with
such
admiration
as
I
can
honestly
give
.
<EOS>
I
call
it
a
very
fine
country
,
 
the
hill
be
steep
,
the
wood
seem
full
of
fine
timber
,
and
the
valley
look
comfortable
and
snug
,
 
with
rich
meadow
and
several
neat
farm
house
scatter
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
It
exactly
answer
my
idea
of
a
fine
country
,
because
it
unite
beauty
with
utility
 
<EOS>
and
I
dare
say
it
be
a
picturesque
one
too
,
because
you
admire
it
<EOS>
;
I
can
easily
believe
it
to
be
full
of
rock
and
promontory
,
grey
moss
and
brush
wood
,
but
these
be
all
lose
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
the
picturesque
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
be
but
too
true
,
"
say
Marianne
;
"
but
why
should
you
boast
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
,
"
say
Elinor
,
"
that
to
avoid
one
kind
of
affectation
,
Edward
here
fall
into
another
.
<EOS>
because
he
believe
many
people
pretend
to
more
admiration
of
the
beauty
of
nature
than
they
really
feel
,
and
be
disgust
with
such
pretension
,
he
affect
great
indifference
and
less
discrimination
in
view
them
himself
than
he
possess
.
<EOS>
He
be
fastidious
and
will
have
an
affectation
of
his
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
true
,
"
say
Marianne
,
"
that
admiration
of
landscape
scenery
be
become
a
mere
jargon
.
<EOS>
every
body
pretend
to
feel
and
try
to
describe
with
the
taste
and
elegance
of
him
who
first
define
what
picturesque
beauty
be
.
<EOS>
I
detest
jargon
of
every
kind
,
and
sometimes
I
have
keep
my
feeling
to
myself
,
because
I
could
find
no
language
to
describe
them

such
of

have
puzzle
him
before

when

he
go
immediately
round

in

I

well
then

I

Mr.

<EOS>
Marianne
be
surprised

confused
,
yet
she
could
not
help
smile
at
the
quiet
archness
of
his
manner
,
and
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
say
    
"
oh
,
Edward
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
?
 
<EOS>
but
the
time
will
come
<EOS>
I
hope
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
like
him

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
it
,
"
reply
he
,
rather
astonish
at
her
earnestness
and
warmth
;
for
have
he
not
imagine
it
to
be
a
joke
for
the
good
of
her
acquaintance
in
general
,
found
only
on
a
something
or
a
nothing
between
Mr.
Willoughby
and
herself
,
he
would
not
have
venture
to
mention
it
.
    
<EOS>
Edward
remain
a
week
at
the
cottage
;
he
be
earnestly
press
by
Mrs.
Dashwood
to
stay
longer
;
but
,
as
if
he
be
bent
only
on
self
-
mortification
,
he
seem
resolve
to
be
go
when
his
enjoyment
among
his
friend
be
at
the
height
.
<EOS>
His
spirit
,
during
the
last
two
or
three
day
,
though
still
very
unequal
,
be
greatly
improve
 
<EOS>
he
grow
more
and
more
partial
to
the
house
and
environ
 
<EOS>
never
speak
of
go
away
without
a
sigh
 
<EOS>
declare
his
time
to
be
wholly
disengage
 
even
doubt
to
what
place
he
should
go
when
he
leave
them
 
<EOS>
but
still
,
go
he
must
.
<EOS>
never
have
any
week
pass
so
quickly
 
he
could
hardly
believe
it
to
be
go
.
<EOS>
He
say
so
repeatedly
;
other
thing
he
say
too
,
which
mark
the
turn
of
his
feeling
and
give
the
lie
to
his
action
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
pleasure
at
Norland
;
he
detest
be
in
town
;
but
either
to
Norland
or
London
,
he
must
go
.
<EOS>
He
value
their
kindness
beyond
any
thing
,
and
his
great
happiness
be
in
be
with
them
.
<EOS>
yet
,
he
must
leave
them
at
the
end
of
a
week
,
in
spite
of
their
wish
and
his
own
,
and
without
any
restraint
on
his
time
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
place
all
that
be
astonish
in
this
way
of
act
to
his
mother
's
account
;
and
it
be
happy
for
her
that
he
have
a
mother
whose
character
be
so
imperfectly
known
to
her
,
as
to
be
the
general
excuse
for
every
thing
strange
on
the
part
of
her
son
.
<EOS>
disappointed
,
however
,
and
vex
as
she
be
,
and
sometimes
displeased
with
his
uncertain
behaviour
to
herself
,
she
be
very
well
disposed
on
the
whole
to
regard
his
action
with
all
the
candid
allowance
and
generous
qualification
,
which
have
be
rather
more
painfully
extort
from
her
,
for
Willoughby
's
service
,
by
her
mother
.
<EOS>
His
want
of
spirit
,
of
openness
,
and
of
consistency
,
be
most
usually
attribute
to
his
want
of
independence
,
and
his
well
knowledge
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
disposition
and
design
.
<EOS>
the
shortness
of
his
visit
,
the
steadiness
of
his
purpose
in
leave
them
,
originate
in
the
same
fettered
inclination
,
the
same
inevitable
necessity
of
temporize
with
his
mother
.
<EOS>
the
old
well
-
establish
grievance
of
duty
against
will
,
parent
against
child
,
be
the
cause
of
all
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
be
glad
to
know
when
these
difficulty
be
to
cease
,
this
opposition
be
to
yield
,
when
Mrs.
Ferrars
would
be
reform
,
and
her
son
be
at
liberty
to
be
happy
.
<EOS>
but
from
such
vain
wish
she
be
force
to
turn
for
comfort
to
the
renewal
of
her
confidence
in
Edward
's
affection
,
to
the
remembrance
of
every
mark
of
regard
in
look
or
word
which
fall
from
him
while
at
Barton
,
and
above
all
to
that
flattering
proof
of
it
which
he
constantly
wear
round
his
finger
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Edward

"
say
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
as
they
be
at
breakfast
the
last
morning

"
you
would
be
a
happy
man

you

plan

<EOS>
some
inconvenience
to
your

indeed

may
result
from
it
 
you
would
not
be
able
to
give
them
so
much
of
your
time

<EOS>

(
with
a
smile

you
would
be
materially

particular

you
would

where
to
go

I

assure
you

"
that
I
have
long
think
on
this
point

as
you
think
now

<EOS>
It
have
be
,
and
be
,
and
probably
will
always
be
a
heavy
misfortune
to
me
,
that
I
have
have
no
necessary
business
to
engage
me
,
no
profession
to
give
me
employment

or
afford
me
any
thing
like
independence

unfortunately
my
own
nicety
,
and
the
nicety
of
my
friend

have
make
me
what
I
be

an
idle
,
helpless
being

We
never

our
choice
of
a

<EOS>
I
always
prefer
the
church

as
I
still
do

<EOS>
but
that
be
not
smart
enough
for
my
family

<EOS>
They
recommend
the
army

<EOS>
that
be
a
great
deal
too
smart

<EOS>
the
law

allow
to

many

who
have
chamber

make
a
very
good
appearance
in
the
first
circle

drive
about
town
in

but
I
have
no
inclination

even
in
this
less
abstruse
study
of
it

which
my
family
approve

<EOS>
as

I
be

at

You
be
in

melancholy

fancy

this

shortly
take

an
uncomfortable
impression

such

without

there

Her

the
past

the
future
,
on
a
subject
so
interesting

must

must
force
her
attention

her
memory

her
reflection

her
fancy

<EOS>
from
a
reverie
of
this
kind

she

rouse
one
morning
,
soon
after
Edward

by
the

of
company

<EOS>
She
happen
to
be
quite
alone

<EOS>
the
closing

at
the
entrance
of
the
green
court

her

<EOS>
She

he
leave
the
rest
of
the
party
to
the
ceremony
of
knock
at
the
door
,
and
step
across
the
turf
,
oblige
her
to
open
the
casement
to
speak
to
him
,
though
the
space
be
so
short
between
the
door
and
the
window

as
to
make
it
hardly
possible
to
speak
at
one
without

They

so
I
say
to
Sir

I
do
think
I
hear
a

Colonel

come
back

Elinor
be
oblige
to
turn
from

in
the

to
receive
the
rest
of
the
party
;
Lady
Middleton
introduce
the
two
stranger
;
Mrs.
Dashwood
and
Margaret
come
down
stair
at
the
same
time
,
and
they
all
sit
down

look
at
one
another

while
Mrs.

continue
her
story
as
she
walk
through
the
passage
into
the
parlour

attend
by
Sir
John

<EOS>
Mrs.
Palmer
be
several
year
young
than
Lady
Middleton
,
and
totally
unlike
her
in
every
respect
.
<EOS>
She
be
short
and
plump
,
have
a
very
pretty
face
,
and
the
fine
expression
of
good
humour
in
it
that
could
possibly
be
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
by
no
means
so
elegant
as
her
sister
's
,
but
they
be
much
more
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
She
come
in
with
a
smile
,
smile
all
the
time
of
her
visit
,
except
when
she
laugh
,
and
smile
when
she
go
away
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
be
a
grave
look
young
man
of
five
or
six
and
twenty
,
with
an
air
of
more
fashion
and
sense
than
his
wife
,
but
of
less
willingness
to
please
or
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
He
enter
the
room
with
a
look
of
self
-
consequence
,
slightly
bow
to
the
lady
,
without
speak
a
word
,
and
,
after
briefly
survey
them
and
their
apartment
,
take
up
a
newspaper
from
the
table
,
and
continue
to
read
it
as
long
as
he
stay
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Palmer
,
on
the
contrary
,
who
be
strongly
endow
by
nature
with
a
turn
for
be
uniformly
civil
and
happy
,
be
hardly
seat
before
her
admiration
of
the
parlour
and
every
thing
in
it
burst
forth
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
what
a
delightful

Mamma

I

<EOS>
only
look

how
delightful
every

<EOS>
how
I
should

Should
not

Mr.

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palmer
make
her
no
answer
,
and
do
not
even
raise
his
eye
from
the
newspaper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Palmer
do
not
hear
me
,
"
say
she
,
laugh
;
"
he
never
do
sometimes
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
ridiculous
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
quite
a
new
idea
to
Mrs.
Dashwood
;
she
have
never
be
use
to
find
wit
in
the
inattention
of
any
one
,
and
could
not
help
look
with
surprise
at
them
both
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
,
in
the
meantime
,
talk
on
as
loud
as
she
could
,
and
continue
her
account
of
their
surprise
,
the
evening
before
,
on
see
their
friend
,
without
cease
till
every
thing
be
tell
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Palmer
laugh
heartily
at
the
recollection
of
their
astonishment
,
and
every
body
agree
,
two
or
three
time
over
,
that
it
have
be
quite
an
agreeable
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
believe
how
glad
we
all
be
to
see
them
,
"
add
Mrs.
Jennings
,
lean
forward
towards
Elinor
,
and
speak
in
a
low
voice
as
if
she
mean
to
be
hear
by
no
one
else
,
though
they
be
seat
on
different
side
of
the
room
;
"
but
,
however
,
I
can
not
help
wish
they
have
not
travel
quite
so
fast
,
nor
make
such
a
long
journey
of
it
,
for
they
come
all
round
by
London
upon
account
of
some
business
,
<EOS>
for
you
know
<EOS>
(
nod
significantly
and
point
to
her
daughter
)
<EOS>
it
be
wrong
in
her
situation
.
<EOS>
I
want
her
to
stay
at
home
and
rest
this
morning
,
but
she
would
come
with
us
;
she
long
so
much
to
see
you
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Palmer
laugh
,
and
say
it
would
not
do
her
any
harm
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
expect
to
be
confine
in
February
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
could
no
longer
endure
such
a
conversation
,
and
therefore
exert
herself
to
ask
Mr.
Palmer
if
there
be
any
news
in
the
paper
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
none
at
all
,
"
he
reply
,
and
read
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
here

Marianne

"
cry
Sir
John
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
now
,
Palmer
,
you
shall
see
a
monstrous
pretty
girl

"
  
<EOS>
He
immediately
go
into
the
passage
,
open
the
front
door
,
and
usher
her
in
himself
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
ask
her
,
as
soon
as
she
appear
,
if
she
have
not
be
to
Allenham
;
and
Mrs.
Palmer
laugh
so
heartily
at
the
question
,
as
to
show
she
understand
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palmer
look
up
on
her
enter
the
room
,
stare
at
her
some
minute
,
and
then
return
to
his
newspaper

<EOS>
Mrs.

's
eye
be
now

by
the
drawing

hang
round

She
get
up
to

"

<EOS>
well

<EOS>
I
declare
they
be
quite
charming
;
I
could
look
at
them
for
ever

"
<EOS>
and
then
sit
down
again
,
she
very
soon
forget
that
there
be
any
such
thing
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
when
Lady
Middleton
rise
to
go
away
,
Mr.
Palmer
rise
also
,
lay
down
the
newspaper
,
stretch
himself
and
look
at
them
all
around

<EOS>
"
My
love
,
have
you
be
asleep
?
"
say
his
wife
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
He
make
her
no
answer
;
and
only
observe
,
after
again
examine
the
room
,
that
it
be
very
low
pitch
,
and
that
the
ceiling
be
crooked
.
<EOS>
He
then
make
his
bow
,
and
depart
with
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
have
be
very
urgent
with
them
all
to
spend
the
next
day
at
the
park
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
who
do
not
choose
to
dine
with
them
oftener
than
they
dine
at
the
cottage
,
absolutely
refuse
on
her
own
account
;
her
daughter
may
do
as
they
please
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
no
curiosity
to
see
how
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Palmer
eat
their
dinner
,
and
no
expectation
of
pleasure
from
them
in
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
They
attempt
,
therefore
,
likewise
,
to
excuse
themselves
;
the
weather
be
uncertain
,
and
not
likely
to
be
good
.
<EOS>
but
Sir
John
would
not
be
satisfied
 
<EOS>
the
carriage
should
be
send
for
them
and
they
must
come
.
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
too
,
though
she
do
not
press
their
mother

press
them

<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
and
Mrs.
Palmer
join
their
entreaty
,
all
seem
equally
anxious
to
avoid
a
family
party
;
and
the
young
lady
be
oblige
to
yield
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
they
ask
us
?
"
<EOS>
say
Marianne
,
as
soon
as
they
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
the
rent
of
this
cottage
be
say
to
be
low
;
but
we
have
it
on
very
hard
term
,
if
we
be
to
dine
at
the
park
whenever
any
one
be
stay
either
with
them
,
or
with
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
mean
no

to
be
civil
and
kind
to
us
now
,
"
say
Elinor
,
"
by
these
frequent
invitation
,
than
by
those
which
we
receive
from
them
a
few
week
ago
.
<EOS>
the
alteration
be
not
in
them
,
if
their
party
be
grow
tedious
and
dull
.
<EOS>
We
must
look
for
the
change
elsewhere

<EOS>
as
the
Miss
Dashwoods

<EOS>
She

them
all
most
affectionately
by
the
hand

and
express
great
delight
in
see
them
again

"
I

so
glad
to
see
you

"
<EOS>

she

seat
herself
between
Elinor
and
Marianne

"
<EOS>
for
it
be
so
bad
a
day
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
you
may
not
come
,
which
would
be
a
shocking
thing
,
as
we
go
away
again
tomorrow

<EOS>
We

go

It

quite
a
sudden

I
know
nothing

it
till
the
carriage
be
come
to
the
door
,
and
then
Mr.
Palmer
ask
me
if
I
would
go
with
him
to
Barton

<EOS>
He
be
so
droll

<EOS>
He

I

so
sorry
we

however
we

meet
again
in

very
soon

They
be

to
put
an
end
to
such
an
expectation

<EOS>
"
not

to

cry
Mrs.
Palmer

with
a
laugh
,
"
I
shall
be
quite
disappointed

I

You

Mrs.

Her

complain
of
the
weather

"
how
horrid
all
this

It

what
the
devil
do
Sir
John
mean
by
not
have
a
billiard
room
in
his
house

how

what
comfort

Sir

as
stupid
as
the
weather

<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
company

dropt
in

"
I
be
afraid

Miss

Sir

you

<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
not
be
so
sly
before

Mrs.
Palmer

for
we
know
all
about
it

,
I
assure
you
;

I
admire
your
taste
very
much

I
think
he
be
extremely
handsome

We
do
not

a
great
way
from

the
country

not

ten

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
well
!
<EOS>
there
be
not

difference

I
never

pretty

"
be
it
very
ugly

"
continue
Mrs.

"
then
it
must
be
some
other

so
pretty
I
suppose

when
they
be
seat
in
the
dining

Sir

observe
with
regret
that

only
eight
all

<EOS>
"
My

"
say
he
to
his

it

very
provoking

you
ask
the
Gilberts

come

do
not
I

"
You

Mrs.
Jennings
,

should
not

upon
such
ceremony

ill

breed

cry
Mr.

"
My
love
you
contradict
every
body

say
his
wife
with
her
usual
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
that
you
be
quite
rude

I

"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
you
may
abuse
me
as
you
please
,
"
say
the
good
-
natured
old
lady
,
"
you
have
take
Charlotte
off
my
hand
,
and
can
not
give
her
back
again
.
<EOS>
so
there
I
have
the
whip
hand
of
you

"
  
<EOS>
Charlotte
laugh
heartily
to
think
that
her
husband
could
not
get
rid
of
her
;
and
exultingly
say
,
she
do
not
care
how
cross
he
be
to
her
,
as
they
must
live
together
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
any
one
to
be
more
thoroughly
good
-
natured
,
or
more
determined
to
be
happy
than
Mrs.
Palmer
.
<EOS>
the
studied
indifference
,
insolence
,
and
discontent
of
her
husband
give
her
no
pain
;
and
when
he
scold
or
abuse
her
,
she
be
highly
divert
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Palmer
be
so
droll
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
in
a
whisper
,
to
Elinor
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
always
out
of
humour
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
be
not
incline
,
after
a
little
observation
,
to
give
him
credit
for
be
so
genuinely
and
unaffectedly
ill
-
natured
or
ill
-
breed
as
he
wish
to
appear
.
<EOS>
His
temper
may
perhaps
be
a
little
sour
by
find
,
like
many
other
of
his
sex
,
that
through
some
unaccountable
bias
in
favour
of
beauty
,
he
be
the
husband
of
a
very
silly
woman
,
 
but
she
know
that
this
kind
of
blunder
be
too
common
for
any
sensible
man
to
be
lastingly
hurt
by
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
rather
a
wish
of
distinction
,
she
believe
,
which
produce
his
contemptuous
treatment
of
every
body
,
and
his
general
abuse
of
every
thing
before
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
desire
of
appear
superior
to
other
people
.
<EOS>
the
motive
be
too
common
to
be
wonder
at
;
but
the
mean
,
however
they
may
succeed
by
establish
his
superiority
in
ill
-
breeding
,
be
not
likely
to
attach
any
one
to
him
except
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
dear
Miss
Dashwood
,
"
say
Mrs.
Palmer
soon
afterwards
,
"
I
have
get
such
a
favour

ask
of

Will
you

Christmas

Miss

certainly

he
reply
,
with
a
sneer

I
come
into
Devonshire
with
no

there
now

<EOS>
They
both
eagerly
and
resolutely
decline
her
invitation

indeed
you
must
and
shall
come

I
be
sure
you
will
like
it
of
all
thing

<EOS>
the
Westons
will
be
with
us
,
and
it
will
be
quite
delightful
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
what
a
sweet
place
Cleveland
be
;
and
we
be
so
gay
now
,
for
Mr.
Palmer
be
always
go
about
the
country
canvass
against
the
election
;
and
so
many
people
come
to
dine
with
us
that
I
never
see
before
,
it
be
quite
charming
!
<EOS>
but
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
it
be
very
fatigue
to
him
!
<EOS>
for
he
be
force
to
make
every
body
like
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
could
hardly
keep
her
countenance
as
she
assent
to
the
hardship
of
such
an
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
charming
it
will
be
,
"
say
Charlotte
,
"
when
he
be
in
Parliament
!
 
<EOS>
will
not
it
?
<EOS>
how
I
shall
laugh
!
<EOS>
It
will
be
so
ridiculous
to
see
all
his
letter
direct
to
him
with
an
M.P.
<EOS>
but
do
you
know
,
he
say
,
he
will
never
frank
for
me
?
<EOS>
He
declare
he
will
not
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
,
Mr.
Palmer
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palmer
take
no
notice
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
can
not
bear
write
,
you
know
,
"
she
continue
;
"
he
say
it
be
quite
shocking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
"
I
never
say
any
thing
so
irrational
.
<EOS>
do
not
palm
all
your
abuse
of
language
upon
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
now
;
you
see
how
droll
he
be
.
<EOS>
this
be
always
the
way
with
him
!
<EOS>
sometimes
he
will
not
speak
to
me
for
half
a
day
together
,

then
he
come
out
with
something
so
droll
 
all
about
any
thing
in

world

"
  
<EOS>
She
surprise
Elinor
very
much
as
they
return
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
by
ask
her
whether
she
do
not
like
Mr.
Palmer
excessively
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly

Elinor
;

he
seem
very
agreeable

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
 
I
be
so
glad
you
do

I

you
would

he
be
so
pleasant
;
and
Mr.
Palmer
be
excessively
pleased
with
you
and
your
sister

I
can
tell
you
,
and
you
can
not
think
how
disappointed
he
will
be
if
you
do
not
come
to
Cleveland
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
why
you
should
object
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
be
again
oblige
to
decline
her
invitation
;
and
by
change
the
subject
,
put
a
stop
to
her
entreaty
.
<EOS>
She
think
it
probable
that
as
they
live
in
the
same
county
,
Mrs.
Palmer
may
be
able
to
give
some
more
particular
account
of
Willoughby
's
general
character
,
than
could
be
gather
from
the
Middletons
'
partial
acquaintance
with
him
;
and
she
be
eager
to
gain
from
any
one
,
such
a
confirmation
of
his
merit
as
may
remove
the
possibility
of
fear
from
Marianne
.
<EOS>
She
begin
by
inquire
if
they
see
much
of
Mr.
Willoughby
at
Cleveland
,
and
whether
they
be
intimately
acquaint
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
yes
;
I
know
him
extremely
well
,
"
reply
Mrs.
Palmer
;
 
"
not
that
I
ever
speak
to
him
,
indeed
;
but
I
have
see
him
for
ever
in
town
.
<EOS>
somehow
or
other
I
never
happen
to
be
stay
at
Barton
while
he
be
at
Allenham
.
<EOS>
Mama
see
him
here
once
before
,
but
I
be
with
my
uncle
at
Weymouth
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
dare
say
we
should
have
see
a
great
deal
of
him
in
Somersetshire
,
if
it
have
not
happen
very
unluckily
that
we
should
never
have
be
in
the
country
together
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
little
at
Combe
,
I
believe
;
but
if
he
be
ever
so
much
there
,
I
do
not
think
Mr.
Palmer
would
visit
him
,
for
he
be
in
the
opposition
,
you
know
,
and
besides
it
be
such
a
way
off
.
<EOS>
I
know
why
you
inquire
about
him
,
very
well
;
your
sister
be
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
monstrous
glad
of
it
,
for
then
I
shall
have
her
for
a
neighbour
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
"
reply
Elinor
,
"
you
know
much
more
of
the
matter
than
I
do
,
if
you
have
any
reason
to
expect
such
a
match
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
pretend
to
deny
it
,
because
you
know
it
be
what
every
body
talk
of

<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
hear
of
it
in
my
way
through
town

<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Palmer
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
honour
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
meet
Colonel
Brandon
Monday
morning
in
Bond
-
street
,
just
before
we
leave
town
,

he
tell
me
of
it
directly

<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
very
much
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Brandon
tell
you
of
it
!
<EOS>
surely
you
must
be
mistake
.
<EOS>
to
give
such
intelligence
to
a
person
who
could
not
be
interested
in
it
,
even
if
it
be
true
,
be
not
what
I
should
expect
Colonel
Brandon
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
assure
you
it
be
so
,
for
all
that
,
and
I
will
tell
you
how
it
happen
.
<EOS>
when
we
meet
him
,
he
turn
back
and
walk
with
us
;
and
so
we
begin
talk
of
my
brother
and
sister
,
and
one
thing
and
another
,
and
<EOS>
I
say
to
him
,
"
so
,
Colonel
,
there
be
a
new
family
come
to
Barton
cottage
,
I
hear
,
and
mama
send
me
word
they
be
very
pretty
,
and
that
one
of
them
be
go
to
be
married
to
Mr.
Willoughby
of
Combe
Magna
.
<EOS>
be
it
true
,
pray
?
<EOS>
for
of
course
you
must
know
,
as
you
have
be
in
Devonshire
so
lately
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
do
the
Colonel
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
 
he
do
not
say
much
;
but
he
look
as
if
he
know
it
to
be
true
,
so
from
that
moment
I
set
it
down
as
certain
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
quite
delightful
,
I
declare
!
<EOS>
when
be
it
to
take
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Brandon
be
<EOS>
very
well
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
quite
well
;
and
so
full
of
your
praise
,
he
do
nothing
but
say
fine
thing
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
flatter
by
his
commendation
.
<EOS>
He
seem
an
excellent
man
;
and
I
think
him
uncommonly
pleasing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
do
I.
He
be
such
a
charming
man
,
that
it
be
quite
a
pity
he
should
be
so
grave
and
so
dull
.
<EOS>
Mamma
say
_
he
_
be
in
love
with
your
sister
too
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
be
a
great
compliment
if
he
be
,
for
he
hardly
ever
fall
in
love
with
any
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
Mr.
Willoughby
much
know
in
your
part
of
Somersetshire
?
"
say
Elinor
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
extremely
well
;
that
is
,
I
do
not
believe
many
people
be
acquaint
with
him
,
because
Combe
Magna
be
so
far
off
;
but
they
all
think
him
extremely
agreeable
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
nobody
be
more
like
than
Mr.
Willoughby
wherever
he
go
,
and
so
you
may
tell
your
sister
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
monstrous
lucky
girl
to
get
him
,
upon
my
honour
;
not
but
that
he
be
much
more
lucky
in
get
her
,
because
she
be
so
very
handsome
and
agreeable
,
that
nothing
can
be
good
enough
for
her
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
not
think
her
hardly
at
all
handsome
than
you
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
for
I
think
you
both
excessively
pretty
,
and
so
do
Mr.
Palmer
<EOS>
too
I
be
sure
,
though
we
could
not

Mrs.
Palmer
's
information

Willoughby

not
very
material

but
any
testimony
in
his

small

be
pleasing

You

It

<EOS>
"
yes

a
great
while

He

he

glad

Sir
John

Middleton
wish
it
very
much

<EOS>
but
mama
do
not
think
the
match
good
enough
for
me
,
otherwise
Sir
John
would
have
mention
it
to
the
Colonel

we
should
have
be
marry
immediately

do
not
Colonel

<EOS>
"
oh
,
no

<EOS>
but
if
mama
have
not
object
to
it

I
dare
say
he
would
have
like
it
of
all
thing
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
see
me
then
above
twice
,
for
it
be
before
I
leave
school

<EOS>
however
,
I
be
much
happy
as
I
be
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palmer
be
the
kind
of
man
I
like
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
Palmers
return
to
Cleveland
the
next
day
,
and
the
two
family
at
Barton
be
again
leave
to
entertain
each
other
.
<EOS>
but
this
do
not
last
long
;
Elinor
have
hardly
get
their
last
visitor
out
of
her
head
,
have
hardly
do
wonder
at
Charlotte
's
be
so
happy
without
a
cause
,
at
Mr.
Palmer
's
acting
so
simply
,
with
good
ability
,
and
at
the
strange
unsuitableness
which
often
exist
between
husband
and
wife
,
before
Sir
John
's
and
Mrs.
Jennings
's
active
zeal
in
the
cause
of
society
,
procure
her
some
other
new
acquaintance
to
see
and
observe
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
morning
's
excursion
to
Exeter
,
they
have
meet
with
two
young
lady
,
whom
Mrs.
Jennings
have
the
satisfaction
of
discover
to
be
her
relation
,
and
this
be
enough
for
Sir
John
to
invite
them
directly
to
the
park
,
as
soon
as
their
present
engagement
at
Exeter
be
over
.
<EOS>
Their
engagement
at
Exeter
instantly
give
way
before
such
an
invitation
,
and
Lady
Middleton
be
throw
into
no
little
alarm
on
the
return
of
Sir
John
,
by
hear
that
she
be
very
soon
to
receive
a
visit
from
two
girl
whom
she
have
never
see
in
her
life
,
and
of
whose
elegance
 
whose
tolerable
gentility
even
 
she
could
have
no
proof
;
for
the
assurance
of
her
husband
and
mother
on
that
subject
go
for
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
Their
be
her
relation
too
make
it
so
much
the
bad
;
and
Mrs.
Jennings
's
attempt
at
consolation
be
therefore
unfortunately
found
,
when
she
advise
her
daughter
not
to
care
about
their
be
so
fashionable
;
because
they
be
all
cousin
and
must
put
up
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
impossible
,
however
,
now
to
prevent
their
come
,
Lady
Middleton
resign
herself
to
the
idea
of
it
,
with
all
the
philosophy
of
a
well
-
breed
woman
,
content
herself
with
merely
give
her
husband
a
gentle
reprimand
on
the
subject
five
or
six
time
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
lady
arrive
:
their
appearance
be
by
no
means
ungenteel
or
unfashionable
.
<EOS>
Their
dress
be
very
smart
,
their
manner
very
civil
,
they
be
delight
with
the
house
,
and
in
rapture
with
the
furniture
,
and
they
happen
to
be
so
doatingly
fond
of
child
that
Lady
Middleton
's
good
opinion
be
engage
in
their
favour
before
they
have
be
an
hour
at
the
Park
.
<EOS>
She
declare
them
to
be
very
agreeable
girl
indeed
,
which
for
her
ladyship
be
enthusiastic
admiration
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
's
confidence
in
his
own
judgment
rise
with
this
animate
praise
,
and
he
set
off
directly
for
the
cottage
to
tell
the
Miss
Dashwoods
of
the
Miss
Steeles
'
arrival
,
and
to
assure
them
of
their
be
the
sweetest
girl
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
from
such
commendation
as
this
,
however
,
there
be
not
much
to
be
learn
;
Elinor
well
know
that
the
sweetest
girl
in
the
world
be
to
be
meet
with
in
every
part
of
England
,
under
every
possible
variation
of
form
,
face
,
temper
and
understanding
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
want
the
whole
family
to
walk
to
the
Park
directly
and
look
at
his
guest
.
<EOS>
Benevolent
,
philanthropic
man
!
<EOS>
It
be
painful
to
him
even
to
keep
a
third
cousin
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
come
now
,
"
say
he
 
<EOS>
"
pray
come
 
<EOS>
you
must
come
 
<EOS>
I
declare
you
shall
come
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
how
you
will
like
them
.
<EOS>
Lucy
be
monstrous
pretty
,
and
so
good
humoured
and
agreeable
!
<EOS>
the
child
be
all
hang
about
her
already
,
as
if
she
be
an
old
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
and
they
both
long
to
see
you
of
all
thing
,
for
they
have
hear
at
Exeter
that
you
be
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
world
;
and
I
have
tell
them
it
be
all
very
true
,
and
a
great
deal
more
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
delighted
with
them
<EOS>
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
They
have
bring
the
whole
coach
full
of
plaything
for
the
child
.
<EOS>
how
can
you
be
so
cross
as
not
to
come
?
<EOS>
why
they
be
your
cousin
,
you
know
,
after
a
fashion
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
be
my
cousin
,
and
they
be
my
wife
's
,
so
you
must
be
relate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Sir
John
could
not
prevail
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
obtain
a
promise
of
their
calling
at
the
Park
within
a
day
or
two
,
and
then
leave
them
in
amazement
at
their
indifference
,
to
walk
home
and
boast
anew
of
their
attraction
to
the
Miss
Steeles
,
as
he
have
be
already
boast
of
the
Miss
Steeles
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
when
their
promise
visit
to
the
Park
and
consequent
introduction
to
these
young
lady
take
place
,
they
find
in
the
appearance
of
the
eld
,
who
be
nearly
thirty
,
with
a
very
plain
and
not
a
sensible
face
,
nothing
to
admire
;
but
in
the
other
,
who
be
not
more
than
two
or
three
and
twenty
,
they
acknowledge
considerable
beauty
;
her
feature
be
pretty
,
and
she
have
a
sharp
quick
eye
,
and
a
smartness
of
air
,
which
though
it
do
not
give
actual
elegance
or
grace
,
give
distinction
to
her
person
.
<EOS>
Their
manner
be
particularly
civil
,
and
Elinor
soon
allow
them
credit
for
some
kind
of
sense
,
when
she
see
with
what
constant
and
judicious
attention
they
be
make
themselves
agreeable
to
Lady
Middleton
.
<EOS>
with
her
child
they
be
in
continual
rapture
,
extoll
their
beauty
,
court
their
notice
,
and
humour
their
whim
;
and
such
of
their
time
as
could
be
spare
from
the
importunate
demand
which
this
politeness
make
on
it
,
be
spend
in
admiration
of
whatever
her
ladyship
be
do
,
if
she
happen
to
be
do
any
thing
,
or
in
take
pattern
of
some
elegant
new
dress
,
in
which
her
appearance
the
day
before
have
throw
them
into
unceasing
delight
.
<EOS>
fortunately
for
those
who
pay
their
court
through
such
foible
,
a
fond
mother
,
though
,
in
pursuit
of
praise
for
her
child
,
the
most
rapacious
of
human
being
,
be
likewise
the
most
credulous
;
her
demand
be
exorbitant
;
but
she
will
swallow
any
thing
;
and
the
excessive
affection
and
endurance
of
the
Miss
Steeles
towards
her
offspring
be
view
therefore
by
Lady
Middleton
without
the
small
surprise
or
distrust
.
<EOS>
She
see
with
maternal
complacency
all
the
impertinent
encroachment
and
mischievous
trick
to
which
her
cousin
submit
.
<EOS>
She
see
their
sash
untie
,
their
hair
pull
about
their
ear
,
their
work
-
bag
search
,
and
their
knife
and
scissor
steal
away
,
and
feel
no
doubt
of
its
be
a
reciprocal
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
It
suggest
no
other
surprise
than
that
Elinor
and
Marianne
should
sit
so
composedly
by
,
without
claim
a
share
in
what
be
pass
.
  
<EOS>
"
John
be
in
such
spirit
today
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
on
his
taking
Miss
Steele
's
pocket
handkerchief
,
and
throw
it
out
of
window
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
full
of
monkey
trick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
soon
afterwards
,
on
the
second
boy
's
violently
pinch
one
of
the
same
lady
's
finger
<EOS>
,
she
fondly
observe
,
"
how
playful
William
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
here
be
my
sweet
little
Annamaria
,
"
she
add
,
tenderly
caress
a
little
girl
of
three
year
old
,
who
have
not
make
a
noise
for
the
last
two
minute
;
"
and
she
be
always
so
gentle
and
quiet
 
<EOS>
never
be
there
such
a
quiet
little
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
unfortunately
in
bestow
these
embrace
,
a
pin
in
her
ladyship
's
head
dress
slightly
scratch
the
child
's
neck
,
produce
from
this
pattern
of
gentleness
such
violent
scream
,
as
could
hardly
be
outdo
by
any
creature
professedly
noisy
.
<EOS>
the
mother
's
consternation
be
excessive
;
but
it
could
not
surpass
the
alarm
of
the
Miss
Steeles
,
and
every
thing
be
do
by
all
three
,
in
so
critical
an
emergency
,
which
affection
could
suggest
as
likely
to
assuage
the
agony
of
the
little
sufferer
.
<EOS>
She
be
seat
in
her
mother
's
lap
,
cover
with
kiss
,
<EOS>
her
wound
bathe
with
lavender
-
water
,
by
one
of
the
Miss
Steeles
,
who
be
on
her
knee
to
attend
her
,
and
her
mouth
stuff
with
sugar
plum
by
the
other
.
<EOS>
with
such
a
reward
for
her
tear
,
the
child
be
too
wise
to
cease
cry
.
<EOS>
She
still
scream
and
sob
lustily
,
kick
her
two
brother
for
offer
to
touch
her
,
and
all
their
united
soothing
be
ineffectual
till
Lady
Middleton
luckily
remember
that
in
a
scene
of
similar
distress
last
week
,
some
apricot
marmalade
have
be
successfully
apply
for
a
bruise
temple
,
the
same
remedy
be
eagerly
propose
for
this
unfortunate
scratch
,
and
a
slight
intermission
of
scream
in
the
young
lady
on
hear
it
,
give
them
reason
to
hope
that
it
would
not
be
reject
.
<EOS>
She
be
carry
out
of
the
room
therefore
in
her
mother
's
arm
,
in
quest
of
this
medicine
,
and
as
the
two
boy
choose
to
follow
,
though
earnestly
entreat
by
their
mother
to
stay
behind
,
the
four
young
lady
be
leave
in
a
quietness
which
the
room
have
not
know
for
many
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
little
creature
!
"
say
Miss
Steele
,
as
soon
as
they
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
have
be
a
very
sad
accident
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yet
I
hardly
know
how
,
"
cry
Marianne
,
"
unless
it
have
be
under
totally
different
circumstance
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
usual
way
of
heighten
alarm
,
where
there
be
nothing
to
be
alarm
at
in
reality
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
sweet
woman
Lady
Middleton
be
!
"
say
Lucy
Steele
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
be
silent
;
it
be
impossible
for
her
to
say
what
she
do
not
feel
,
however
trivial
the
occasion
;
and
upon
Elinor
therefore
the
whole
task
of
tell
lie
when
politeness
require
it
,
always
fall
.
<EOS>
She
do
her
good
when
thus
call
on
,
by
speak
of
Lady
Middleton
with
more
warmth
than
she
feel
,
though
with
far
less
than
Miss
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
Sir
John
too
,
"
cry
the
eld
sister
,
"
what
a
charming
man
he
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
here
too
,
Miss
Dashwood
's
commendation
,
be
only
simple
and
just
,
come
in
without
any
éclat
.
<EOS>
She
merely
observe
that
he
be
perfectly
good
humoured
and
friendly
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
a
charming
little
family
they
have
!
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
fine
child
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
quite
doat
upon
them
already
,
and
indeed
I
be
always
distractedly
fond
of
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
guess
so
,
"
say
Elinor
,
with
a
smile
,
"
from
what
I
have
witness
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
notion
,
"
say
Lucy
,
<EOS>
"
you
think
the
little
Middletons
rather
too
much
indulged
;
perhaps
they
may
be
the
outside
of
enough
;
but
it
be
so
natural
in
Lady
Middleton
;
and
for
my
part
,
I
love
to
see
child
full
of
life
and
spirit
;
I
can
not
bear
them
if
they
be
tame
and
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
confess
,
"
reply
Elinor
,
"
that
while
I
be
at
Barton
Park
,
I
never
think
of
tame
and
quiet
child
with
any
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
short
pause
succeed
this
speech
,
which
be
first
break
by
Miss
Steele
,
who
seem
very
much
dispose
for
conversation
,
and
who
now
say
rather
abruptly
,
"
<EOS>
and
how
do
you
like
Devonshire
,
Miss
Dashwood
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
be
very
sorry
to
leave
Sussex
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
some
surprise
at
the
familiarity
of
this
question
,
or
at
least
of
the
manner
in
which
it
be
speak
,
Elinor
reply
that
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
Norland
be
a
prodigious
beautiful
place
,
be
not
it
?
"
add
Miss
Steele
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
hear
Sir
John
admire
it
excessively
,
"
say
Lucy
,
who
seem
to
think
some
apology
necessary
for
the
freedom
of
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
every
one

must

admire
it

Elinor
,
"
who
ever
see
the
place

though
it
be
not

estimate
its

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
have
you
a
great
many
smart
beaux
there
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
not
so
many
in
this
part
of
the
world
;
for
my
part
,
I
think
they
be
a
vast
addition
always
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
why
should
you
think
,
"
say
Lucy
,
look
ashamed
of
her
sister
,
"
that
there
be
not
as
many
genteel
young
man
in
Devonshire
as
Sussex
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
dear
,
I
be
sure
I
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
there
an't
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
there
be
a
vast
many
smart
beaux
in
Exeter
;
but
you
know
,
how
could
I
tell
<EOS>
what
smart
beaux
there
may
be
about
Norland
;
and
I
be
only
afraid
the
Miss
Dashwoods
may
find
it
dull
at
Barton
,
if
they
have
not
so
many
as
they
use
to
have
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
young
lady
may
not
care
about
the
beaux
,
and
have
as
lief
be
without
them
as
with
them
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
think
they
be
vastly
agreeable
,
provide
they
dress
smart
and
behave
civil
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
bear
to
see
them
dirty
and
nasty
.
<EOS>
now
there
be
Mr.
Rose
at
Exeter
,
a
prodigious
smart
young
man
,
quite
a
beau
,
clerk
to
Mr.
Simpson
,
you
know
,
<EOS>
and
yet
if
you
do
but
meet
him
of
a
morning
,
he
be
not
fit
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
your
brother
be
quite
a
beau
,
Miss
Dashwood
,
before
he
marry
,
as
he
be
so
rich
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
"
reply
Elinor
,
"
I
can
not
tell
you
,
for
I
do
not
perfectly
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
word
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
can
say
,
that
if
he
ever
be
a
beau
before
he
marry
,
he
be
one
still
for
there
be
not
the
small
alteration
in
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
dear
!
<EOS>
one
never
think
of
married
man
's
be
beaux
 
<EOS>
they
have
something
else
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
!
Anne
,
"
cry
her
sister
,
"
you
can
talk
of
nothing
but
beaux
;
 
you
will
make
Miss
Dashwood
believe
you
think
of
nothing
else
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
to
turn
the
discourse
,
she
begin
admire
the
house
and
the
furniture
.
  
<EOS>
this
speciman
of
the
Miss
Steeles
be
enough
.
<EOS>
the
vulgar
freedom
and
folly
of
the
eld
leave
her
no
recommendation
,
and
as
Elinor
be
not
blind
by
the
beauty
,
or
the
shrewd
look
of
the
young
,
to
her
want
of
real
elegance
and
artlessness
,
she
leave
the
house
without
any
wish
of
know
them
better
.
  
<EOS>
not
so
the
Miss
Steeles
.
<EOS>
They
come
from
Exeter
,
well
provide
with
admiration
for
the
use
of
Sir
John
Middleton
,
his
family
,
and
all
his
relation
,
and
no
niggardly
proportion
be
now
deal
out
to
his
fair
cousin
,
whom
they
declare
to
be
the
most
beautiful
,
elegant
,
accomplished
,
and
agreeable
girl
they
have
ever
beheld
,
and
with
whom
they
be
particularly
anxious
to
be
better
acquaint
.
<EOS>
and
to
be
better
acquaint
therefore
,
Elinor
soon
find
be
their
inevitable
lot
,
for
as
Sir
John
be
entirely
on
the
side
of
the
Miss
Steeles
,
their
party
would
be
too
strong
for
opposition
,
and
that
kind
of
intimacy
must
be
submit
to
,
which
consist
of
sit
an
hour
or
two
together
in
the
same
room
almost
every
day
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
could
do
no
more
;
but
he
do
not
know
that
any
more
be
require
:
to
be
together
be
,
in
his
opinion
,
to
be
intimate
,
and
while
his
continual
scheme
for
their
meeting
be
effectual
,
he
have
not
a
doubt
of
their
be
establish
friend
.
  
<EOS>
to
do
him
justice
,
he
do
every
thing
in
his
power
to
promote
their
unreserve
,
by
make
the
Miss
Steeles
acquaint
with
whatever
he
know
or
suppose
of
his
cousin
'
situation
in
the
most
delicate
particular
,
 
and
Elinor
have
not
see
them
more
than
twice
,
before
the
eld
of
them
wish
her
joy
on
her
sister
's
have
be
so
lucky
as
to
make
a
conquest
of
a
very
smart
beau
since
she
come
to
Barton
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
twill
be
a
fine
thing
to
have
her
marry
<EOS>
so
young
to
be
sure
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
hear
he
be
quite
a
beau
,
and
prodigious
handsome
.
<EOS>
and
I
hope
you
may
have
as
good
luck
yourself
soon
,
 
but
perhaps
you
may
have
a
friend
in
the
corner
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
could
not
suppose
that
Sir
John
would
be
more
nice
in
proclaim
his
suspicion
of
her
regard
for
Edward
,
than
he
have
be
with
respect
to
Marianne
;
indeed
it
be
rather
his
favourite
joke
of
the
two
,
as
be
somewhat
new
and
more
conjectural
;
and
since
Edward
's
visit
,
they
have
never
dine
together
without
his
drinking
to
her
good
affection
with
so
much
significancy
<EOS>
and
so
many
nod
and
wink
,
as
to
excite
general
attention
.
<EOS>
the
letter
F
have
be
likewise
invariably
bring
forward
,
and
find
productive
of
such
countless
joke
,
that
its
character
as
the
witty
letter
in
the
alphabet
have
be
long
establish
with
Elinor
.
  
<EOS>
the
Miss
Steeles
,
as
she
expect
,
have
now
all
the
benefit
of
these
joke
,
and
in
the
eld
of
them
they
raise
a
curiosity
to
know
the
name
of
the
gentleman
allude
to
,
which
,
though
often
impertinently
express
,
be
perfectly
of
a
piece
with
her
general
inquisitiveness
into
the
concern
of
their
family
.
<EOS>
but
Sir
John
do
not
sport
long
with
the
curiosity
which
he
delight
to
raise
,
for
he
have
at
least
as
much
pleasure
in
tell
the
name
,
as
Miss
Steele
have
in
hear
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
name
be
Ferrars
,
"
say
he
,
in
a
very
audible
whisper
;
"
but
pray
do
not
tell
it
,
for
it
be
a
great
secret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ferrar

repeat
Miss
Steele
;
"
Mr.

what

your

<EOS>
"
how
can
you
say
so

Anne

"
<EOS>
cry
Lucy
,
who
generally
make
an
amendment
to
all
her
sister
's
assertion
.
<EOS>
"
though
we
have
see
him
once
or
twice
at
my
uncle

it
be
rather
too
much
to
pretend

know
him
very
well

"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
hear
all
this
with
attention
and
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
and
who
be
this
uncle
?
<EOS>
where
do
he
live
?
<EOS>
how
come
they
acquaint

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
wish
very
much
to
have
the
subject
continue
,
though
she
do
not
choose
to
join
in
it
herself
;
but
nothing
more
of
it
be
say
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
she
think
Mrs.
Jennings
deficient
either
in
curiosity
after
petty
information
,
or
in
a
disposition
to
communicate
it
.
<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
Miss
Steele
have
speak
of
Edward
,
increase
her
curiosity
;
for
it
strike
her
as
be
rather
ill
-
natured
,
and
suggest
the
suspicion
of
that
lady
's
knowing
,
or
fancy
herself
to
know
something
to
his
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
but
her
curiosity
be
unavaile
,
for
no
farther
notice
be
take
of
Mr.
Ferrars
's
name
by
Miss
Steele
when
allude
to
,
or
even
openly
mention
by
Sir
John
.
    
<EOS>
Marianne
,
who
have
never
much
toleration
for
any
thing
like
impertinence
,
vulgarity
,
inferiority
of
part
,
or
even
difference
of
taste
from
herself
,
be
at
this
time
particularly
ill
-
disposed
,
from
the
state
of
her
spirit
,
to
be
pleased
with
the
Miss
Steeles
,
or
to
encourage
their
advance
;
and
to
the
invariable
coldness
of
her
behaviour
towards
them
,
which
check
every
endeavour
at
intimacy
on
their
side
,
Elinor
principally
attribute
that
preference
of
herself
which
soon
become
evident
in
the
manner
of
both
,
but
especially
of
Lucy
,
who
miss
no
opportunity
of
engage
her
in
conversation
,
or
of
strive
to
improve
their
acquaintance
by
an
easy
and
frank
communication
of
her
sentiment
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
be
naturally
clever
;
her
remark
be
often
just
and
amusing
;
and
as
a
companion
for
half
an
hour
Elinor
frequently
find
her
agreeable
;
but
her
power
have
receive
no
aid
from
education
:
she
be
ignorant
and
illiterate
;
and
her
deficiency
of
all
mental
improvement
,
her
want
of
information
in
the
most
common
particular
,
could
not
be
conceal
from
Miss
Dashwood
,
in
spite
of
her
constant
endeavour
to
appear
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
Elinor
see
,
and
pity
her
for
,
the
neglect
of
ability
which
education
may
have
render
so
respectable
;
but
she
see
,
with
less
tenderness
of
feeling
,
the
thorough
want
of
delicacy
,
of
rectitude
,
and
integrity
of
mind
,
which
her
attention
,
her
assiduity
,
her
flattery
at
the
Park
betray
;
and
she
could
have
no
last
satisfaction
in
the
company
of
a
person
who
join
insincerity
with
ignorance
;
whose
want
of
instruction
prevent
their
meeting
in
conversation
on
term
of
equality
,
and
whose
conduct
toward
other
make
every
show
of
attention

deference
towards
herself
perfectly
valueless

<EOS>
"
You
will

Lucy
to

day

together

<EOS>
Elinor
_
do
_
think
the

a

odd
one

her
countenance
express
it
,

she
answer
that
she
have
never
see
Mrs.

<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
reply
Lucy
;
"
I
wonder
at
that
,
for
I
think
you
must
have
see
her
at
Norland
sometimes

then
,
perhaps
,
you
can
not
tell
me
what
sort
of

<EOS>
"
no

return
Elinor

cautious
of
give
her
real
opinion
of
Edward

not
very
desirous

what
seem
impertinent
curiosity

I
be

you

very
strange

about
her
in
such
a
way

say
Lucy
,
eye
Elinor
attentively
as
she
speak
;
<EOS>
"
but
perhaps
there
may
be
reason
 
I
wish
I
may
venture
;
but
however
I
hope
you
will
do
me
the
justice
of
believe
that
I
do
not

impertinent

"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
make
her
a
civil
reply

they
walk
on
for
a
few
minute
in
silence

<EOS>
It
be
break
by
Lucy

who
renew
the

again
by

,
with
some
hesitation
    
<EOS>

I

so
well

I
be

glad

really
I
never

I
be
a

surprised

I

serious

I

at

observe
its
effect
on

"

Elinor
at

Astonishment

that
would
have
be
as
painful
as
it

strong

not
an

She
turn
towards
Lucy
in
silent
amazement

unable
to
divine
the
reason
or
object
of
such
a
declaration
;
and
though
her
complexion
vary
,
she
stand
firm
in
incredulity

feel
in
no
danger

an
hysterical
fit

a
swoon

for
to

I
dare

say
he
never
drop
the
small

it

not
a

my

She
pause

remain
silent

Her
astonishment
at
what

hear
be
at

too
great
for

at
length
force
herself
to
speak
,

to
speak
cautiously

she

,
with
calmness
of
manner

tolerably
well
conceal
her
surprise

solicitude

He

I
be
very
unwilling

enter
into
it

as
you
may
imagine
,
without
the

approbation
of

I
be

secret

You
know
nothing

therefore
,
there
could
be
no

occasion

,
as
he
be
always
particularly
afraid

suspect
any

that

be
reason
enough
for

be
silent

sunk

It
put

then
take

good

She
put
it
into

when

whatever

her
fear

her
wish

Lucy

to
give

I
be
very
much
vexed
at

anxious

a

pace
in

first

say
she

"
I
have
no
doubt
in
the
world

because
you
must
know
of
what
importance
it
be
to
us

not
to
have
it
reach
his
mother

for
she
would
never
approve
of
it

,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
no
fortune

I
fancy
she

an
exceed
proud

<EOS>
"
I
certainly
do
not

Elinor

you
do
me
no
more
than
justice

on

Your
secret
be
safe
with
me

pardon
me
if
I
express
some
surprise
at
so
unnecessary
a
communication

<EOS>
You
must
at
least
have
feel
that
my
be
acquaint
with
it
could
not
add
to
its
safety

<EOS>
as
she
say
this
,
she
look
earnestly
at
Lucy
,
hope
to
discover
something
in
her
countenance
;
perhaps
the
falsehood
of
the
great
part
of
what
she
have
be
say
;
but
Lucy
's
countenance
suffer
no
change
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
you
would
think
I
be
take
a
great
liberty
with
you
,
"
say
she
,
"
in
tell
you
all
this
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
know
you
long
to
be
sure
,
personally
at
least
,
but
I
have
know
you
and
all
your
family
by
description
a
great
while
;
and
as
soon
as
I
see
you
,
I
feel
almost
as
if
you
be
an
old
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
besides
in
the
present
case
,
I
really
think
some
explanation
be
due
to
you
after
my
make
such
particular
inquiry
about
Edward
's
mother
;
and
I
be
so
unfortunate
,
that
I
have
not
a
creature
whose
advice
I
can
ask
.
<EOS>
Anne
be
the
only
person
that
know
of
it
,
and
she
have
no
judgment
at
all
;
indeed
,
she
do
me
a
great
deal
more
harm
than
good
,
for
I
be
in
constant
fear
of
her
betray
me
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
how
to
hold
her
tongue
,
as
you
must
perceive
,
and
I
be
sure
I
be
in
the
great
fright
in
the
world
t'other
day
,
when
Edward
's
name
be
mention
by
Sir
John
,
lest
she
should
out
with
it
all
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
how
much
I
go
through
in
my
mind
from
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
only
wonder
that
I
be
alive
after
what
I
have
suffer
for
Edward
's
sake
these
last
four
year
.
<EOS>
every
thing
in
such
suspense
and
uncertainty
;
and
see
him
so
seldom
 
<EOS>
we
can
hardly
meet
above
twice
a
-
year
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
wonder
my
heart
be
not
quite
broke
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
she
take
out
her
handkerchief
;
but
Elinor
do
not
feel
very
compassionate
.
  
<EOS>
"
sometimes
,
"
continue
Lucy
,
after
wipe
her
eye
,
"
I
think
whether
it
would
not
be
well
for
us
both
to
break
off
the
matter
entirely
.
"
<EOS>
as
she
say
this
,
she
look
directly
at
her
companion
.
"
<EOS>
but
then
at
other
time
I
have
not
resolution
enough
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
make
him
so
miserable
,
as
I
know
the
very
mention
of
such
a
thing
would
do
.
<EOS>
and
on
my
own
account
too
 
so
dear
as
he
be
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
could
be
equal
to
it
.
<EOS>
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
in
such
a
case
,
Miss
Dashwood
?
<EOS>
what
would
you
do
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
,
"
reply
Elinor
,
startle
by
the
question
;
"
but
I
can
give
you
no
advice
under
such
circumstance
.
<EOS>
Your
own
judgment
must
direct
you
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
"
continue
Lucy
,
after
a
few
minute
silence
on
both
side
,
"
his
mother
must
provide
for
him
sometime
or
other
;
but
poor
Edward
be
so
cast
down
by
it
!
<EOS>
do
you
not
think
him
dreadful
low
-
spirit
when
he
be
at
Barton
?
<EOS>
He
be
so
miserable
when
he
leave
us
at
Longstaple
,
to
go
to
you
,
<EOS>
that
I
be
afraid
you
would
think
him
quite
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
come
from
your
uncle
's
,
then
,
when
he
visit
us
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
he
have
be
stay
a
fortnight
with
us

<EOS>
do
you
think
he
come
directly
from
town
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
reply
Elinor
,
most
feelingly
sensible
of
every
fresh
circumstance
in
favour
of
Lucy
's
veracity
;
"
I
remember
he
tell
us
,
that
he
have
be
stay
a
fortnight
with
some
friend
near
Plymouth
.
"
<EOS>
She
remember
too
,
her
own
surprise
at
the
time
,
at
his
mention
nothing
farther
of
those
friend
,
at
his
total
silence
with
respect
even
to
their
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
think
him
sadly
out
of
spirit
?
"
repeat
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
do
,
indeed
,
particularly
so
when
he
first
arrive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
him
to
exert
himself
for
fear
<EOS>
you
should
suspect
what
be
the
matter
;
but
it
make
him
so
melancholy
,
not
be
able
to
stay
more
than
a
fortnight
with
us
,
and
see
me
so
much
affected
.
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
it
be
just
the
same
with
him
now
;
for
he
write
in
wretched
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
hear
from
him
just
before
I
leave
Exeter
;
"
take
a
letter
from
her
pocket
and
carelessly
show
the
direction
to
Elinor
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
his
hand
,
I
dare
say
,
a
charming
one
it
be
;
but
that
be
not
write
so
well
as
usual
.
<EOS>
He
be
tired
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
for
he
have
just
fill
the
sheet
to
me
as
full
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
see
that
it
_
be
_
his
hand
,
and
she
could
doubt
no
longer
.
<EOS>
this
picture
,
she
have
allow
herself
to
believe
,
may
have
be
accidentally
obtain
;
it
may
not
have
be
Edward
's
gift
;
but
a
correspondence
between
them
by
letter
,
could
subsist
only
under
a
positive
engagement
,
could
be
authorise
by
nothing
else
;
for
a
few
moment
,
she
be
almost
overcome
 
<EOS>
her
heart
sink
within
her
,
and
she
could
hardly
stand
;
but
exertion
be
indispensably
necessary
;
and
she
struggle
so
resolutely
against
the
oppression
of
her
feeling
,
that
her
success
be
speedy
,
and
for
the
time
complete
.
  
<EOS>
"
write
to
each
other
,
"
say
Lucy
,
return
the
letter
into
her
pocket
,
"
be
the
only
comfort
we
have
in
such
long
separation
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
have
one
other
comfort
in
his
picture
,
but
poor
Edward
have
not
even
_
that
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
if
he
have
<EOS>
but
my
picture
<EOS>
,
he
say
he
should
be
easy
.
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
lock
of
my
hair
set
in
a
ring
when
he
be
at
Longstaple
last
,
and
that
be
some
comfort
to
him
,
he
say
,
but
not
equal
to
a
picture
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
may
notice
the
ring
when
you
see
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
say
Elinor
,
with
a
composure
of
voice
,
under
which
be
conceal
an
emotion
and
distress
beyond
any
thing
she
have
ever
feel
before
.
<EOS>
She
be
mortify
,
shocked
,
confound
.
  
<EOS>
fortunately
for
her
,
they
have
now
reach
the
cottage
,
and
the
conversation
could
be
continue
no
farther
.
<EOS>
after
sit
with
them
a
few
minute
,
the
Miss
Steeles
return
to
the
Park
,
and
Elinor
be
then
at
liberty
to
think
and
be
wretched
.
    
<EOS>
however
small
Elinor
's
general
dependence
on
Lucy
's
veracity
may
be
,
it
be
impossible
for
her
on
serious
reflection
to
suspect
it
in
the
present
case
,
where
no
temptation
could
be
answerable
to
the
folly
of
invent
a
falsehood
of
such
a
description
.
<EOS>
what
Lucy
have
assert
to
be
true
,
therefore
,
Elinor
could
not
,
dare
not
longer
doubt
;
support
as
it
be
too
on
every
side
by
such
probability
and
proof
,
and
contradict
by
nothing
but
her
own
wish
.
<EOS>
Their
opportunity
of
acquaintance
in
the
house
of
Mr.
Pratt
be
a
foundation
for
the
rest
,
at
once
indisputable
and
alarming
;
and
Edward
's
visit
near
Plymouth
,
his
melancholy
state
of
mind
,
his
dissatisfaction
at
his
own
prospect
,
his
uncertain
behaviour
towards
herself
,
the
intimate
knowledge
of
the
Miss
Steeles
as
to
Norland
and
their
family
connection
,
which
have
often
surprise
her
,
the
picture
,
the
letter
,
the
ring
,
form
altogether
such
a
body
of
evidence
,
as
overcame
every
fear
of
condemn
him
unfairly
,
and
establish
as
a
fact
,
which
no
partiality
could
set
aside
,
his
ill
-
treatment
of
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
resentment
of
such
behaviour
,
her
indignation
at
have
be
its
dupe
,
for
a
short
time
make
her
feel
only
for
herself
;
but
other
idea
,
other
consideration
,
soon
arise
.
<EOS>
have
Edward
be
intentionally
deceive
her
?
<EOS>
have
he
feign
a
regard
for
her
which
he
do
not
feel
?
<EOS>
be
his
engagement
to
Lucy
an
engagement
of
the
heart
?
<EOS>
no
;
whatever
it
may
once
have
be
,
she
could
not
believe
it
such
at
present
.
<EOS>
His
affection
be
all
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
deceive
in
that
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
sister
,
Fanny
,
all
have
be
conscious
of
his
regard
for
her
at
Norland
;
it
be
not
an
illusion
of
her
own
vanity
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
love
her
.
<EOS>
what
a
softener
of
the
heart
be
this
persuasion
!
<EOS>
how
much
could
it
not
tempt
her
to
forgive
!
<EOS>
He
have
be
blamable
,
highly
blamable
,
in
remain
at
Norland
after
he
first
feel
her
influence
over
him
to
be
more
than
it
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
in
that
,
he
could
not
be
defend
;
but
if
he
have
injure
her
,
how
much
more
have
he
injure
himself
;
if
her
case
be
pitiable
,
his
be
hopeless
.
<EOS>
His
imprudence
have
make
her
miserable
for
a
while
;
but
it
seem
to
have
deprive
himself
of
all
chance
of
ever
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
She
may
in
time
regain
tranquillity
;
but
<EOS>
_
he
_
,
what
have
he
to
look
forward
to
?
<EOS>
Could
he
ever
be
tolerably
happy
with
Lucy
Steele
;
could
he
,
be
his
affection
for
herself
out
of
the
question
,
with
his
integrity
,
his
delicacy
,
and
well
-
inform
mind
,
be
satisfied
with
a
wife
like
her
 
illiterate
,
artful
,
and
selfish
?
  
<EOS>
the
youthful
infatuation
of
nineteen
would
naturally
blind
him
to
every
thing
but
her
beauty
and
good
nature
;
but
the
four
succeed
year
 
year
,
which
if
rationally
spend
,
give
such
improvement
to
the
understanding
,
must
have
open
his
eye
to
her
defect
of
education
,
while
the
same
period
of
time
,
spend
on
her
side
in
inferior
society
and
more
frivolous
pursuit
,
have
perhaps
rob
her
of
that
simplicity
which
may
once
have
give
an
interesting
character
to
her
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
if
in
the
supposition
of
his
seeking
to
marry
herself
,
his
difficulty
from
his
mother
have
seem
great
,
how
much
great
be
they
now
likely
to
be
,
when
the
object
of
his
engagement
be
undoubtedly
inferior
in
connection
,
and
probably
inferior
in
fortune
to
herself
.
<EOS>
these
difficulty
,
indeed
,
with
a
heart
so
alienated
from
Lucy
,
may
not
press
very
hard
upon
his
patience
;
but
melancholy
be
the
state
of
the
person
by
whom
the
expectation
of
family
opposition
and
unkindness
,
could
be
feel
as
a
relief
!
  
<EOS>
as
these
consideration
occur
to
her
in
painful
succession
,
she
weep
for
him
,
more
than
for
herself
.
<EOS>
support
by
the
conviction
of
have
do
nothing
to
merit
her
present
unhappiness
,
and
console
by
the
belief
that
Edward
have
do
nothing
to
forfeit
her
esteem
,
she
think
she
could
even
now
,
under
the
first
smart
of
the
heavy
blow
,
command
herself
enough
to
guard
every
suspicion
of
the
truth
from
her
mother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
and
so
well
be
she
able
to
answer
her
own
expectation
,
that
when
she
join
them
at
dinner
only
two
hour
after
she
have
first
suffer
the
extinction
of
all
her
dear
hope
,
no
one
would
have
suppose
from
the
appearance
of
the
sister
,
that
Elinor
be
mourn
in
secret
over
obstacle
which
must
divide
her
for
ever
from
the
object
of
her
love
,
and
that
Marianne
be
internally
dwell
on
the
perfection
of
a
man
,
of
whose
whole
heart
<EOS>
she
feel
thoroughly
possess
,
and
whom
she
expect
to
see
in
every
carriage
which
drive
near
their
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
necessity
of
conceal
from
her
mother
and
Marianne
,
what
have
be
entrust
in
confidence
to
herself
,
though
it
oblige
her
to
uncease
exertion
,
be
no
aggravation
of
Elinor
's
distress
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
it
be
a
relief
to
her
,
to
be
spare
the
communication
of
what
would
give
such
affliction
to
them
,
and
to
be
save
likewise
from
hear
that
condemnation
of
Edward
,
which
would
probably
flow
from
the
excess
of
their
partial
affection
for
herself
,
and
which
be
more
than
she
feel
equal
to
support
.
  
<EOS>
from
their
counsel
,
or
their
conversation
,
she
know
she
could
receive
no
assistance
,
their
tenderness
and
sorrow
must
add
to
her
distress
,
while
her
self
-
command
would
neither
receive
encouragement
from
their
example
nor
from
their
praise
.
<EOS>
She
be
strong
alone
,
and
her
own
good
sense
<EOS>
so
well
support
her
,
that
her
firmness
be
as
unshaken
,
her
appearance
of
cheerfulness
as
invariable
,
as
with
regret
so
poignant
and
so
fresh
,
it
be
possible
for
them
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
much
as
she
have
suffer
from
her
first
conversation
with
Lucy
on
the
subject
,
she
soon
feel
an
earnest
wish
of
renew
it
;
and
this
for
more
reason
than
one
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
hear
many
particular
of
their
engagement
repeat
again
,
she
want
more
clearly
to
understand
what
Lucy
really
feel
for
Edward
,
whether
there
be
any
sincerity
in
her
declaration
of
tender
regard
for
him
,
and
she
particularly
want
to
convince
Lucy
,
by
her
readiness
to
enter
on
the
matter
again
,
and
her
calmness
in
converse
on
it
,
that
she
be
no
otherwise
interested
in
it
than
as
a
friend
,
which
she
very
much
fear
her
involuntary
agitation
,
in
their
morning
discourse
,
must
have
leave
at
least
doubtful
.
<EOS>
that
Lucy
be
dispose
to
be
jealous
of
her
appear
very
probable
:
it
be
plain
that
Edward
have
always
speak
highly
in
her
praise
,
not
merely
from
Lucy
's
assertion
,
but
from
her
venture
to
trust
her
on
so
short
a
personal
acquaintance
,
with
a
secret
so
confessedly
and
evidently
important
.
<EOS>
and
even
Sir
John
's
joking
intelligence
must
have
have
some
weight
.
<EOS>
but
indeed
,
while
Elinor
remain
so
well
assured
within
herself
of
be
really
beloved
by
Edward
,
it
require
no
other
consideration
of
probability
to
make
it
natural
that
Lucy
should
be
jealous
;
and
that
she
be
so
<EOS>
,
her
very
confidence
be
a
proof
.
<EOS>
what
other
reason
for
the
disclosure
of
the
affair
could
there
be
,
but
that
Elinor
may
be
inform
by
it
of
Lucy
's
superior
claim
on
Edward
,
and
be
teach
to
avoid
him
in
future
?
<EOS>
She
have
little
difficulty
in
understand
thus
much
of
her
rival
's
intention
,
and
while
she
be
firmly
resolve
to
act
by
her
as
every
principle
of
honour
and
honesty
direct
,
to
combat
her
own
affection
for
Edward
and
to
see
him
as
little
as
possible
;
she
could
not
deny
herself
the
comfort
of
endeavour
to
convince
Lucy
that
her
heart
be
unwounded
.
<EOS>
and
as
she
could
now
have
nothing
more
painful
to
hear
on
the
subject
than
have
already
be
tell
,
she
do
not
mistrust
her
own
ability
of
go
through
a
repetition
of
particular
with
composure
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
immediately
that
an
opportunity
of
do
so
could
be
command
,
though
Lucy
be
as
well
disposed
as
herself
to
take
advantage
of
any
that
occur
;
for
the
weather
be
not
often
fine
enough
to
allow
of
their
joining
in
a
walk
,
where
they
may
most
easily
separate
themselves
from
the
other
;
and
though
they
meet
at
least
every
other
evening
either
at
the
park
or
cottage
,
and
chiefly
at
the
former
,
they
could
not
be
suppose
to
meet
for
the
sake
of
conversation
.
<EOS>
such
a
thought
would
never
enter
either
Sir
John
or
Lady
Middleton
's
head
;
and
therefore
very
little
leisure
be
ever
give
for
a
general
chat
,
and
none
at
all
for
particular
discourse
.
<EOS>
They
meet
for
the
sake
of
eating
,
drink
,
and
laugh
together
,
play
at
card
,
or
consequence
,
or
any
other
game
that
be
sufficiently
noisy
.
  
<EOS>
one
or
two
meeting
of
this
kind
have
take
place
,
without
afford
Elinor
any
chance
of
engage
Lucy
in
private
,
when
Sir
John
call
at
the
cottage
one
morning
,
to
beg
,
in
the
name
of
charity
,
that
they
would
all
dine
with
Lady
Middleton
that
day
,
as
he
be
oblige
to
attend
the
club
at
Exeter
,
and
she
would
otherwise
be
quite
alone
,
except
her
mother
and
the
two
Miss
Steeles
.
<EOS>
Elinor
,
who
foresaw
a
fairer
opening
for
the
point
she
have
in
view
,
in
such
a
party
as
this
be
likely
to
be
,
more
at
liberty
among
themselves
under
the
tranquil
and
well
-
breed
direction
of
Lady
Middleton
than
when
her
husband
unite
them
together
in
one
noisy
purpose
,
immediately
accept
the
invitation
;
Margaret
,
with
her
mother
's
permission
,
be
equally
compliant
,
and
Marianne
,
though
always
unwilling
to
join
any
of
their
party
,
be
persuade
by
her
mother
,
who
could
not
bear
to
have
her
seclude
herself
from
any
chance
of
amusement
,
to
go
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
lady
go
,
and
Lady
Middleton
be
happily
preserve
from
the
frightful
solitude
which
have
threaten
her
.
<EOS>
the
insipidity
of
the
meeting
be
exactly
such
as
Elinor
have
expect
;
it
produce
not
one
novelty
of
thought
or
expression
,
and
nothing
could
be
less
interesting
than
the
whole
of
their
discourse
both
in
the
dining
parlour
and
drawing
room
:
to
the
latter
,
the
child
accompany
them
,
and
while
they
remain
there
,
she
be
too
well
convinced
of
the
impossibility
of
engage
Lucy
's
attention
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
They
quit
it
only
with
the
removal
of
the
tea
-
thing
.
<EOS>
the
card
-
table
be
then
place
,
and
Elinor
begin
to
wonder
at
herself
for
have
ever
entertain
a
hope
of
find
time
for
conversation
at
the
park
.
<EOS>
They
all
rise
up
in
preparation
for
a
round
game
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
,
"
say
Lady
Middleton
to
Lucy
,
"
you
be
not
go
to
finish
poor
little
Annamaria
's
basket
this
evening
;
for
I
be
sure
it
must
hurt
your
eye
to
work
filigree
by
candlelight
.
<EOS>
and
we
will
make
the
dear
little
love
some
amend
for
her
disappointment
to
-
morrow
,
and
then
I
hope
she
will
not
much
mind
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
hint
be
enough
,
Lucy
recollect
herself
instantly
and
reply
,
"
indeed
you
be
very
much
mistaken
,
Lady
Middleton
;
I
be
only
wait
to
know
whether
you
can
make
your
party
without
me
,
or
I
should
have
be
at
my
filigree
already
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
disappoint
the
little
angel
for
all
the
world
:
and
if
you
want
me
at
the
card
-
table
now
,
I
be
resolve
to
finish
the
basket
after
supper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
good
,
I
hope
it
will
not
hurt
your
eye
:
 
<EOS>
will
you
ring
the
bell
for
some
work
candle
?
<EOS>
My
poor
little
girl
would
be
sadly
disappointed
,
I
know
,
if
the
basket
be
not
finish
tomorrow
,
for
though
I
tell
her
it
certainly
would
not
,
I
be
sure
she
depend
upon
have
it
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
directly
draw
her
work
table
near
her
and
reseat
herself
with
an
alacrity
and
cheerfulness
which
seem
to
infer
that
she
could
taste
no
great
delight
than
in
make
a
filigree
basket
for
a
spoilt
child
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
propose
a
rubber
of
Casino
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
no
one
make
any
objection
but
Marianne
,
who
with
her
usual
inattention
to
the
form
of
general
civility
,
exclaim
,
"
Your
ladyship
will
have
the
goodness
to
excuse
_
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
you
know
I
detest
card
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
to
the
piano
-
forte
;
I
have
not
touch
it
since
it
be
tune
.
"
<EOS>
and
without
farth
ceremony
,
she
turn
away
and
walk
to
the
instrument
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
look
as
if
she
thank
heaven
that
_
<EOS>
she
_
have
never
make
so
rude
a
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
Marianne
can
never
keep
long
from
that
instrument
you
know
,
madam
,
"
say
Elinor
,
endeavour
to
smooth
away
the
offence
;
"
and
I
do
not
much
wonder
at
it
;
for
it
be
the
very
good
tone
piano
-
forte
I
ever
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
remain
five
be
now
to
draw
their
card
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
continue
Elinor
,
"
if
I
should
happen
to
cut
out
,
I
may
be
of
some
use
to
Miss
Lucy
Steele
,
in
roll
her
paper
for
her
;
and
there
be
so
much
still
to
be
do
to
the
basket
,
that
it
must
be
impossible
<EOS>
I
think
for
her
labour
singly
,
to
finish
it
this
evening
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
the
work
exceedingly
,
if
she
would
allow
me
a
share
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
shall
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
for
your
help
,
"
cry
Lucy
,
"
for
I
find
there
be
more
to
be
do
to
it
than
I
think
there
be
;
and
it
would
be
a
shocking
thing
to
disappoint
dear
Annamaria
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
that
would
be
terrible
,
indeed
,
"
say
Miss
Steele
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
dear
little
soul
,
how
I
do
love
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
kind
,
"
say
Lady
Middleton
to
Elinor
;
"
and
as
you
really
like
the
work
,
perhaps
you
will
be
as
well
pleased
not
to
cut
in
till
another
rubber
,
or
will
you
take
your
chance
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
joyfully
profit
by
the
first
of
these
proposal
,
and
thus
by
a
little
of
that
address
which
Marianne
could
never
condescend
to
practise
,
gain
her
own
end
,
and
please
Lady
Middleton
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Lucy
make
room
for
her
with
ready
attention
,
and
the
two
fair
rival
be
thus
seat
side
by
side
at
the
same
table
,
and
,
with
the
utmost
harmony
,
engage
in
forward
the
same
work
.
<EOS>
the
pianoforte
at
which
Marianne
,
wrap
up
in
her
own
music
and
her
own
thought
,
have
by
this
time
forget
that
any
body
be
in
the
room
besides
herself
,
be
luckily
so
near
them
that
Miss
Dashwood
now
judge
she
may
safely
,
under

for

the

you

set
my

afraid
I
have
offend
you
by
what
I
tell
you
that
Monday

"
offend
me

<EOS>
how
could
you
suppose
so
?

believe
me

Elinor
speak
it
with
the
true
sincerity
,
"
nothing
could
be
farth
from
my

to
give
you
such
an
idea

Could
you

a
motive
for
the

that
be
not
honourable

flattering
to

and
yet
I
do
assure
you

reply
Lucy
,
her
little
sharp
eye
full
of
meaning
,
"
there
seem
to
me
to
be
a
coldness
and
displeasure
in
your
manner
that
make
me
quite
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
that
you
be
angry
with
me
;
and
have
be
quarrel
with
myself
ever
since
,
for
have
take
such
a
liberty
as
to
trouble
you
with
my
affair
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
very
glad
to
find
it
be
only
my
own
fancy
,
and
that
you
really
do
not
blame
me
.
<EOS>
if
you
know
what
a
consolation
it
be
to
me
to
relieve
my
heart
speak
to
you
of
what
I
be
always
think
of
every
moment
of
my
life
,
your
compassion
would
make
you
overlook
every
thing
else
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
can
easily
believe
that
it
be
a
very
great
relief
to
you
,
to
acknowledge
your
situation
to
me
,
and
be
assure
that
you
shall
never
have
reason
to
repent
it
.
<EOS>
Your
case
be
a
very
unfortunate
one
;
you
seem
to
me
to
be
surround
with
difficulty
,
and
you
will
have
need
of
all
your
mutual
affection
to
support
you
under
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ferrars
,
I
believe
,
be
entirely
dependent
on
his
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
only
two
thousand
pound
of
his
own
;
it
would
be
madness
to
marry
upon
that
,
though
for
my
own
part
,
I
could
give
up
every
prospect
of
more
without
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
always
use
to
a
very
small
income
,
and
could
struggle
with
any
poverty
for
him
;
but
I
love
him
too
well
to
be
the
selfish
mean
of
rob
him
,
perhaps
,
of
all
that
his
mother
may
give
him
if
he
marry
to
please
her
.
<EOS>
We
must
wait
,
it
may
be
for
many
year
.
<EOS>
with
almost
every
other
man
in
the
world
,
it
would
be
an
alarming
prospect
;
but
Edward
's
affection
and
constancy
nothing
can
deprive
me
of
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
conviction
must
be
every
thing
to
you
;
and
he
be
undoubtedly
support
by
the
same
trust
in
your
'
.
<EOS>
if
the
strength
of
your
reciprocal
attachment
have
fail
,
as
between
many
people
,
and
under
many
circumstance
it
naturally
would
during
a
four
year
'
engagement
,
your
situation
would
have
be
pitiable
,
indeed
.

<EOS>
Lucy
here
look
up
;

Elinor
be
careful
in
guard
her
countenance
from
every
expression
that
could
give
her
word
a
suspicious
tendency

<EOS>
"
Edward
's
love
for

Lucy

have
be
pretty
well
put
to
the
test

by

long

very
long
absence

stand
the
trial
so
well

that
I
should

unpardonable

it

I

Lucy
go
on

so
much
more
in

our
continual
separation

enough

for
suspicion

the
slight
alteration

any
lowness

in

I
do
not

I

particularly
observant

all
the
tediousness

in

mutual
silence

place

Lucy

put
an
end
to
it
by

in
a
low
tone

Marianne

give
them
the
powerful
protection
of
a
very
magnificent
concerto
    
<EOS>
"
I
will
honestly
tell
you
of
one
scheme

have
lately
come
into

bring
matter

;
indeed
I
be
bind
to

into

party
concern

I
dare
say
you
have
see
enough
of
Edward
to
know
that
he
would
prefer
the
church
to
every
other
profession
;
now
my
plan
be
that
he
should
take
order
as
soon
as
he
can
,
and
then
through
your
interest
,
which
I
be
sure
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
use
out
of
friendship
for
him
,
and
I
hope
out
of
some
regard
to
me

,
your
brother
may
be
persuade
to
give
him
Norland
live
;
<EOS>
which
I
understand
be
a
very
good
one
,
and
the
present
incumbent
not
likely
to
live
a
great
while
.
<EOS>
that
would
be
enough
for
us
to
marry
upon
,

we
may
trust
to
time
and
chance
for
the
rest

I
should
always
be
happy

reply
Elinor
,
"
to
show
any
mark
of
my
esteem

friendship
for
Mr.
Ferrars

but
do
you
not
perceive
that
my
interest
on
such
an
occasion
would
be
perfectly
unnecessary
?
<EOS>
He
be
brother
to
Mrs.
John
Dashwood

that
_
must
be
recommendation
enough
to
her
husband

Mrs.
John
Dashwood
would
not
much
approve
of
Edward

go
into
order

<EOS>

then
I
rather
suspect
that
my

very
little

<EOS>
They
be
again
silent

many
minute

at
length
Lucy
exclaim
with
a
deep
sigh

I
believe
it
would
be
the
wise
way
to
put
an
end

<EOS>
We
seem
so
beset
with
difficulty

that
though
it
would
make
us
miserable
for
a
time

we
should
be
happy

in
the
end

you

your
advice

no

Elinor

with
a
smile

conceal
very
agitated
feeling

"
on
such
a
subject
I
certainly
will
not

<EOS>
You
know
very
well
that
my
opinion

have
no
weight

side

<EOS>
"
indeed
you
wrong
me

reply
Lucy

with
great
solemnity

I
know
nobody

judgment
I
think
so
highly

I
do
really

I
advise

by
all

put
an
end

will
be
more
for

it
immediately

<EOS>
Elinor
blush
for
the
insincerity
of
Edward
's
future
wife

reply
,

this
compliment
would
effectually
frighten
me
from

any
opinion

I
form
one

It
raise
my
influence

high

the
power

much
for

say
Lucy

with
some
pique

lay
a
particular
stress
on
those
word
,

that
your
judgment

justly
have
such
weight
with

if
you
could
be
suppose

your
own
feeling

your

<EOS>
Elinor
think
it
wisest
to
make
no
answer
to
this
,
lest
they
may
provoke
each
other
to
an
unsuitable
increase
of
ease

unreserve

be
even
partly
determine
never
to
mention
the
subject
again

<EOS>
another
pause
therefore
of
many
minute

duration

succeed
this
speech

Lucy
be
still
the
first
to
end
it

Elinor
be
soon
call
to
the
card

table
by
the
conclusion

first
rubber

the
confidential
discourse
of
the
two
lady
be
therefore
at
an
end

to
which
both

nothing

on
either
side

make

dislike
each
other
less
than
they
have

before

and
Elinor
sit
down
to
the
card
table
with
the
melancholy
persuasion
that
Edward
be
not
only
without
affection
for
the
person
who
be
to
be
his
wife
;
but
that
he
have
not

the
chance
of
be
tolerably
happy
in
marriage

which
sincere
affection
on

<EOS>
her

side

keep
a
man
to
an
engagement

from

never

Elinor

and
when
enter
on
by
Lucy
,
who
seldom
miss
an
opportunity
of
introduce
it
,
and
be
particularly
careful
to
inform
her
confidante
,
of
her
happiness
whenever
she
receive
a
letter
from
Edward
,
it
be
treat
by
the
former
with
calmness
and
caution
,
and
dismiss
as
soon
as
civility
would
allow
;
for
she
feel
such
conversation
to
be
an
indulgence
which
Lucy
do
not
deserve
,

which
be
dangerous
to
herself

the

Miss
Steeles

lengthen
far
beyond
what
the

their
numerous
and
long
arrange
engagement
in
Exeter

absolute

to
stay
nearly
two
month
at

the
due
celebration
of
that
festival

require

private
ball

large

Though
Mrs.
Jennings
be
in
the
habit
of
spend
a
large
portion
of
the
year
at
the
house
of
her
child
and
friend
,
she
be
not
without
a
settled
habitation
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
since
the
death
of
her
husband
,
who
have
trade
with
success
in
a
less
elegant
part
of
the
town
,
she
have
reside
every
winter
in
a
house
in
one
of
the
street
near
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
towards
this
home
,
she
begin
on
the
approach
of
January
to
turn
her
thought
,
and
thither
she
one
day
abruptly
,
and
very
unexpectedly
by
them
,
ask
the
elder
Misses
Dashwood
to
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
Elinor
,
without
observe
the
vary
complexion
of
her
sister
,
and
the
animate
look
which
speak
no
indifference
to
the
plan
,
immediately
give
a
grateful
but
absolute
denial
for
both
,
in
which
she
believe
herself
to
be
speak
their
united
inclination
.
<EOS>
the
reason
allege
be
their
determine
resolution
of
not
leave
their
mother
at
that
time
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
receive
the
refusal
with
some
surprise
,
and
repeat
her
invitation
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Lord
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
your
mother
can
spare
you
very
well
,
and
I
_
do
<EOS>
_
beg
<EOS>
you
will
favour
me
with
your
company
,
for
I
have
quite
set
my
heart
upon
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
fancy
that
you
will
be
any
inconvenience
to
me
,
for
I
shall
not
put
myself
at
all
out
of
my
way
for
you
.
<EOS>
It
will
only
be
send
Betty
by
the
coach
,
and
I
hope
I
can
afford
_
that
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
We
three
shall
be
able
to
go
very
well
in
my
chaise
;
and
when
we
be
in
town
,
if
you
do
not
like
to
go
wherever
I
do
,
well
and
good
,
you
may
always
go
with
one
of
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
your
mother
will
not
object
to
it
;
for
I
have
have
such
good
luck
in
get
my
own
child
off
my
hand
that
she
will
think
me
a
very
fit
person
to
have
the
charge
of
you
;
and
if
I
do
not
get
one
of
you
at
least
well
married
before
I
have
do
with
you
,
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
.
<EOS>
I
shall
speak
a
good
word
for
you
to
all
the
young
man
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
notion
,
"
say
Sir
John
,
"
that
Miss
Marianne
would
not
object
to
such
a
scheme
,
if
her
eld
sister
would
come
into
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
hard
indeed
that
she
should
not
have
a
little
pleasure
,
because
Miss
Dashwood
do
not
wish
it
.
<EOS>
so
I
would
advise
you
two
,
to
set
off
for
town
,
when
you
be
tired
of
Barton
,
without
say
a
word
to
Miss
Dashwood
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Jennings
,
"
I
be
sure
I
shall
be
monstrous
glad
of
Miss
Marianne
's
company
,
whether
Miss
Dashwood
will
go
or
not
,
only
the
more
the
merrier
say
I
,
and
I
think
it
would
be
more
comfortable
for
them
to
be
together
;
because
,
if
they
get
tired
of
me
,
they
may
talk
to
one
another
,
and
laugh
at
my
old
way
behind
my
back
.
<EOS>
but
one
or
the
other
,
if
not
both
of
them
,
I
must
have
.
<EOS>
Lord
bless
me
!
<EOS>
how
do
you
think
I
can
live
poke
by
myself
,
I
who
have
be
always
use
till
this
winter
to
have
Charlotte
with
me
.
<EOS>
come
,
Miss
Marianne
,
let
us
strike
hand
upon
the
bargain
,
and
if
Miss
Dashwood
will
change
her
mind
by
and
bye
,
why
so
much
the
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
madam
,
sincerely
thank
you
,
"
say
Marianne
,
with
warmth
:
"
your
invitation
have
insure
my
gratitude
for
ever

it
would
give
me
such
happiness
,
yes
,
almost
the
great
happiness
I
be
capable
of

to
be
able

accept
it

<EOS>

my
mother

my
dear

kind
mother

I
feel
the
justice
of
what
Elinor
have
urge
,
and
if
she
be
to
be
make
less
happy
,
less
comfortable
by
our
absence
 
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
no

nothing
should
tempt
me
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
It
should
not

must
not

a
struggle

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
repeat
her
assurance
that
Mrs.
Dashwood
could
spare
them
perfectly
well
;
and
Elinor
,
who
now
understand
her
sister
,
and
see
to
what
indifference
to
almost
every
thing
else
she
be
carry
by
her
eagerness
to
be
with
Willoughby
again
,
make
no
farther
direct
opposition
to
the
plan
,
and
merely
refer
it
to
her
mother
's
decision
,
from
whom
however
she
scarcely
expect
to
receive
any
support
in
her
endeavour
to
prevent
a
visit
,
which
she
could
not
approve
of
for
Marianne
,
and
which
on
her
own
account
she
have
particular
reason
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
whatever
Marianne
be
desirous
of
,
her
mother
would
be
eager
to
promote
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
expect
to
influence
the
latter
to
cautiousness
of
conduct
in
an
affair
respect
which
she
have
never
be
able
to
inspire
her
with
distrust
;
and
she
dare
not
explain
the
motive
of
her
own
disinclination
for
go
to
London
.
<EOS>
that
Marianne
,
fastidious
as
she
be
,
thoroughly
acquaint
with
Mrs.
Jennings
'
manner
,
and
invariably
disgust
by
them
,
should
overlook
every
inconvenience
of
that
kind

<EOS>
should
disregard
whatever
must
be
most
wound
to
her
irritable
feeling

in
her
pursuit
of
one
object

be
such
a
proof

so
strong
,
so
full
,
of
the
importance
of
that
object
to
her
,
as
Elinor
,
in
spite
of
all
that
have
pass
,
be
not
prepared
to
witness
.
  
<EOS>
on
be
inform
of
the
invitation
,
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
persuade
that
such
an
excursion
would
be
productive
of
much
amusement
to
both
her
daughter
,
and
perceive
through
all
her
affectionate
attention
to
herself
,
how
much
the
heart
of
Marianne
be
in
it
,
would
not
hear
of
their
decline
the
offer
upon
_
her
_
account
;
insist
on
their
both
accept
it
directly
;
and
then
begin
to
foresee
,
with
her
usual
cheerfulness
,
a
variety
of
advantage
that
would
accrue
to
them
all
,
from
this
separation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
delighted
with
the

it

exactly
what
I

<EOS>
Margaret

I

yourself

<EOS>
when
you

the
Middletons

we
shall
go
on
so
quietly

happily
together
with
our

<EOS>
You

find
Margaret
so
improve

<EOS>
I
have
a
little
plan
of
alteration
for
your
bedroom
too
,
which
may
now
be
perform
without
any
inconvenience
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
right
that
you
_
should
_
go
to
town
;
I
would
have
every
young
woman
of
your
condition
in
life
acquaint
with
the
manner
and
amusement
of
London
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
under
the
care
of
a
motherly
good
sort
of
woman
,
of
whose
kindness
to
you
I
can
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
and
in
all
probability
you
will
see
your
brother
,
and
whatever
may
be
his
fault
,
or
the
fault
of
his
wife
,
when
I
consider
whose
son
he
be
,
I
can
not
bear
to
have
you
so
wholly
estranged
from
each
other

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
though
with
your
usual
anxiety
for
our
happiness
,
"
say
Elinor
,
"
you
have
be
obviate
every
impediment
to
the
present
scheme
which
occur

still
one

<EOS>
Marianne

sink

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
what
,
"
say
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
"
be
my

prudent
Elinor
go
to
suggest

<EOS>
what
formidable
obstacle
be
she
now
to
bring
forward
?
<EOS>
do
let
me
hear
a
word
about
the
expense
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
objection
be
this
;
though
I
think
very
well
of
Mrs.
Jennings
's
heart
,
she
be
not
a
woman
whose
society
can
afford
us
pleasure
,
or
whose
protection
will
give
us
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
true
,
"
reply
her
mother
,
"
but
of
her
society
,
separately
from
that
of
other
people
,
you
will
scarcely
have
any
thing
at
all
,
and
you
will
almost
always
appear
in
public
with
Lady
Middleton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
Elinor
be
frighten
away
by
her
dislike
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
"
say
Marianne
,
"
at
least
it
nee
not
prevent
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
my
_
accept
her
invitation
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
such
scruple
,
and
I
be
sure
I
could
put
up
with
every
unpleasantness
of
that
kind
with
very
little
effort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
could
not
help
smile
at
this
display
of
indifference
towards
the
manner
of
a
person
,
to
whom
she
have
often
have
difficulty
in
persuade
Marianne
to
behave
with
tolerable
politeness
;
and
resolve
within
herself
,
that
if
her
sister
persist
in
go
,
she
would
go
likewise
,
as
she
do
not
think
it
proper
that
Marianne
should
be
leave
to
the
sole
guidance
of
her
own
judgment
,
or
that
Mrs.
Jennings
should
be
abandon
to
the
mercy
of
Marianne
for
all
the
comfort
of
her
domestic
hour
.
<EOS>
to
this
determination
she
be
the
more
easily
reconcile
,
by
recollect
that
Edward
Ferrars
,
by
Lucy
's
account
,
be
not
to
be
in
town
before
February
;
and
that
their
visit
,
without
any
unreasonable
abridgement
,
may
be
previously
finish
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
you
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
both
_
go
,
"
say
Mrs.
Dashwood
;
"
these
objection
be
nonsensical
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
much
pleasure
in
be
in
London
,
and
especially
in
be
together
;
and
if
Elinor
would
ever
condescend
to
anticipate
enjoyment
,
she
would
foresee
it
there
from
a
variety
of
source
;
she
would
,
perhaps
,
expect
some
from
improve
her
acquaintance
with
her
sister
-
in

law
's
family

"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
have
often
wish
for
an
opportunity
of
attempt
to
weaken
her
mother
's
dependence
on
the
attachment
of
Edward
and
herself
,
that
the
shock
may
be
less
when
the
whole
truth
be
reveal
,
and
now
on
this
attack
,
though
almost
hopeless
of
success
,
she
force
herself
to
begin
her
design
by
say
,
as
calmly
as
she
could
,
"
I
like
Edward
Ferrars
very
much
,
and
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
him
;
but
as
to
the
rest
of
the
family
,
it
be
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference

me

whether
I

<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
smile
,
and
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
Marianne
lift
up
her
eye
in
astonishment
,
and
Elinor
conjecture
that
she
may
as
well
have
hold
her
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
after
very
little
farth
discourse
,
it
be
finally
settle
that
the
invitation
should
be
fully
accept
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
receive
the
information
with
a
great
deal
of
joy
,
and
many
assurance
of
kindness
and
care
;
nor
be
it
a
matter
of
pleasure
merely
to
her

<EOS>
Sir
John
be
delight
;
for
to
a
man
,
whose
prevail
anxiety
be
the
dread
of
be
alone
,
the
acquisition
of
two

to
the
number
of
inhabitant
in
London
,
be
something
.
<EOS>
even
Lady
Middleton
take
the
trouble
of
be
delight
,
which
be
put
herself
rather
out
of
her
way
;
and
as
for
the
Miss
Steeles
,
especially
Lucy
,
they
have
never
be
so
happy
in
their
life
as
this
intelligence
make
them
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
submit
to
the
arrangement
which
counteract
her
wish
with
less
reluctance
than
she
have
expect
to
feel
.
<EOS>
with
regard
to
herself
,
it
be
now
a
matter
of
unconcern
whether
she
go
to
town
or
not
,
and
when
she
see
her
mother
so
thoroughly
please
with
the
plan
,
and
her
sister
exhilarate
by
it
in
look
,
voice
,
and
manner
,
restore
to
all
her
usual
animation
,
and
elevate
to
more
than
her
usual
gaiety

she
could
not
be
dissatisfy
with
the
cause
,
and
would
hardly
allow
herself
to
distrust
the
consequence

<EOS>
Marianne
's
joy
be
almost
a
degree
beyond
happiness
,
so
great
be
the
perturbation
of
her
spirit
and
her
impatience
to
be
go
.
<EOS>
Her
unwillingness
to
quit
her
mother
be
her
only
restorative
to
calmness
;
and
at
the
moment
of
part
her
grief
on
that
score
be
excessive
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
affliction
be
hardly
less
,
and
Elinor
be
the
only
one
of
the
three
,
who
seem
to
consider
the
separation
as
any
thing
short
of
eternal
.
  
<EOS>
Their
departure
take
place
in
the
first
week
in
January
.
<EOS>
the
Middletons
be
to
follow
in
about
a
week
.
<EOS>
the
Miss
Steeles
keep
their
station
at
the
park
,
and
be
to
quit
it
only
with
the
rest
of
the
family
.
    
<EOS>
Elinor
could
not
find
herself
in
the
carriage
with
Mrs.
Jennings
,
and
begin
a
journey
to
London
under
her
protection
,
and
as
her
guest
,
without
wonder
at
her
own
situation
,
so
short
have
their
acquaintance
with
that
lady
be
,
so
wholly
unsuited
be
they
in
age
and
disposition
,
and
so
many
have
be
her
objection
against
such
a
measure
only
a
few
day
before
!
<EOS>
but
these
objection
have
all
,
with
that
happy
ardour
of
youth
which
Marianne
and
her
mother
equally
share
,
be
overcome
or
overlook
;
and
Elinor
,
in
spite
of
every
occasional
doubt
of
Willoughby
's
constancy
,
could
not
witness
the
rapture
of
delightful
expectation
which
fill
the
whole
soul
and
beam
in
the
eye
of
Marianne
,
without
feel
how
blank
be
her
own
prospect
,
how
cheerless
her
own
state
of
mind
in
the
comparison
,
and
how
gladly
she
would
engage
in
the
solicitude
of
Marianne
's
situation
to
have
the
same
animating
object
in
view
,
the
same
possibility
of
hope
.
<EOS>
a
short
,
a
very
short
time
however
must
now
decide
what
Willoughby
's
intention
be
;
in
all
probability
he
be
already
in
town

<EOS>
Marianne

eagerness
to
be

her
dependence
on

there

his
character
which
her
own
observation
or
the
intelligence
of
other
could
give
her
,
but
likewise
upon
watch
his
behaviour
to
her
sister
with
such
zealous
attention
,
as
to
ascertain
what
he
be
and
what
he
mean
,
before
many
meeting
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
Should
the
result
of
her
observation
be
unfavourable
,
she
be
determine
at
all
event
to
open
the
eye
of
her
sister
;
should
it
be
otherwise
,
her
exertion
would
be
of
a
different
nature
 
she
must
then
learn
to
avoid
every
selfish
comparison
,
and
banish
every
regret
which
may
lessen
her
satisfaction
in
the
happiness
of
Marianne
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
three
day
on
their
journey
,
and
Marianne
's
behaviour
as
they
travel
be
a
happy
speciman
of
what
future
complaisance
and
companionableness
to
Mrs.
Jennings
may
be
expect
to
be
.
<EOS>
She
sit
in
silence
almost
all
the
way
,
wrapt
in
her
own
meditation
,
and
scarcely
ever
voluntarily
speak
,
except
when
any
object
of
picturesque
beauty
within
their
view
draw
from
her
an
exclamation
of
delight
exclusively
address
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
to
atone
for
this
conduct
therefore
,
Elinor
take
immediate
possession
of
the
post
of
civility
which
she
have
assign
herself
,
behave
with
the
great
attention
to
Mrs.
Jennings
,
talk
with
her
,
laugh
with
her
,
and
listen
to
her
whenever
she
could
;
and
Mrs.
Jennings
on
her
side
treat
them
both
with
all
possible
kindness
,
be
solicitous
on
every
occasion
for
their
ease
and
enjoyment
,
and
only
disturb
that
she
could
not
make
them
choose
their
own
dinner
at
the
inn
,
nor
extort
a
confession
of
their
prefer
salmon
to
cod
,
or
boil
fowl
to
veal
cutlet
.
<EOS>
They
reach
town
by
three
o'clock
the
third
day
,
glad
to
be
release
,
after
such
a
journey
,
from
the
confinement
of
a
carriage
,
and
ready
to
enjoy
all
the
luxury
of
a
good
fire
.
  
<EOS>
the
house
be
handsome
,
and
handsomely
fit
up
,
and
the
young
lady
be
immediately
put
in
possession
of
a
very
comfortable
apartment
.
<EOS>
It
have
formerly
be
Charlotte
's
,
and
over
the
mantelpiece
still
hang
a
landscape
in
coloured
silk
of
her
performance
,
in
proof
of
her
have
spend
seven
year
at
a
great
school
in
town
to
some
effect
.
  
<EOS>
as
dinner
be
not
to
be
ready
in
less
than
two
hour
from
their
arrival
,
Elinor
determine
to
employ
the
interval
in
write
to
her
mother
,
and
sit
down
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
moment
Marianne
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
write
home
,
Marianne
,
"
say
Elinor
;
"
have
not
you
better
defer
your
letter
for
a
day
or
two
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
_
not
_
go
to
write
to
my
mother
,
"
reply
Marianne
,
hastily
,
and
as
if
wish
to
avoid
any
farther
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Elinor
say
no
more
;
it
immediately
strike
her
that
she
must
then
be
write
to
Willoughby
;
and
the
conclusion
which
as
instantly
follow
be
,
that
,
however
mysteriously
they
may
wish
to
conduct
the
affair
,
they
must
be
engage
.
<EOS>
this
conviction
,
though
not
entirely
satisfactory
,
give
her
pleasure
,
and
she
continue
her
letter
with
great
alacrity
.
<EOS>
Marianne
's
be
finish
in
a
very
few
minute
;
in
length
it
could
be
no
more
than
a
note
;
it
be
then
fold
up
,
seal
,
and
direct
with
eager
rapidity
.
<EOS>
Elinor
think
she
could
distinguish
a
large
w
in
the
direction
;
and
no
sooner
be
it
complete
than
Marianne
,
ring
the
bell
,
request
the
footman
who
answer
it
to
get
that
letter
convey
for
her
to
the
two
-
penny
post
.
<EOS>
this
decide
the
matter
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Her
spirit
still
continue
very
high
;
but
there
be
a
flutter
in
them
which
prevent
their
give
much
pleasure
to
her
sister
,
and
this
agitation
increase
as
the
evening
draw
on
.
<EOS>
She
could
scarcely
eat
any
dinner
,
and
when
they
afterwards
return
to
the
drawing
room
,
seem
anxiously
listen
to
the
sound
of
every
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
Elinor
that
Mrs.
Jennings
,
by
be
much
engage
in
her
own
room
,
could
see
little
of
what
be
pass
.
<EOS>
the
tea
thing
be
bring
in
,
and
already
have
Marianne
be
disappoint
more
than
once
by
a
rap
at
a
neighbouring
door
,
when
a
loud
one
be
suddenly
hear
which
could
not
be
mistake
for
one
at
any
other
house
,
Elinor
feel
secure
of
its
announce
Willoughby
's
approach
,
and
Marianne
,
start
up
,
move
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
every
thing
be
silent
;
this
could
not
be
bear
many
second
;
she
open
the
door
,
advance
a
few
step
towards
the
stair
,
and
after
listen
half
a
minute
,
return
into
the
room
in
all
the
agitation
which
a
conviction
of
have
hear
him
would
naturally
produce
;
in
the
ecstasy
of
her
feeling
at
that
instant
she
could
not
help
exclaim
,
"
oh
,
Elinor
,
it
be
Willoughby
,
indeed
it
be
!
"
and
seem
almost
ready
to
throw
herself
into
his
arm
,
when
Colonel
Brandon
appear
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
too
great
a
shock
to
be
bear
with
calmness
,
and
she
immediately
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
Elinor
be
disappoint
too
;
but
at
the
same
time
her
regard
for
Colonel
Brandon
ensure
his
welcome
with
her
;
and
she
feel
particularly
hurt
that
a
man
so
partial
to
her
sister
should
perceive
that
she
experience
nothing
but
grief
and
disappointment
in
see
him
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
see
that
it
be
not
unnoticed
by
him
,
that
he
even
observe
Marianne
as
she
quit
the
room
,
with
such
astonishment
and
concern
,
as
hardly
leave
him
the
recollection
of
what
civility
demand
towards
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
your
sister
ill
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
answer
in
some
distress
that
she
be
,
and
then
talk
of
head
-
ache
,
low
spirit
,
and
over
fatigue
;
and
of
every
thing
to
which
she
could
decently
attribute
her
sister
's
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
He
hear
her
with
the
most
earnest
attention
,
but
seem
to
recollect
himself
,
say
no
more
on
the
subject
,
and
begin
directly
to
speak
of
his
pleasure
at
see
them
in
London
,
make
the
usual
inquiry
about
their
journey
,
and
the
friend
they
have
leave
behind
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
calm
kind
of
way
,
with
very
little
interest
on
either
side
,
they
continue
to
talk
,
both
of
them
out
of
spirit
,
and
the
thought
of
both
engage
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Elinor
wish
very
much
to
ask
whether
Willoughby
be
then
in
town
,
but
she
be
afraid
of
give
him
pain
by
any
enquiry
after
his
rival
;
and
at
length
,
by
way
of
say
something
,
she
ask
if
he
have
be
in
London
ever
since
she
have
see
him
last
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
reply
,
with
some
embarrassment
,
"
almost
ever
since
;
I
have
be
once
or
twice
at
Delaford
for
a
few
day
,
but
it
have
never
be
in
my
power
to
return
to
Barton
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
,
and
the
manner
in
which
it
be
say
,
immediately
bring
back
to
her
remembrance
all
the
circumstance
of
his
quitting
that
place
,
with
the
uneasiness
and
suspicion
they
have
cause
to
Mrs.
Jennings
,
and
she
be
fearful
that
her
question
have
imply
much
more
curiosity
on
the
subject
than
she
have
ever
feel
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
soon
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

Colonel
,

say
she
,
with
her
usual
noisy
cheerfulness
,
"
I
be
monstrous
glad

He
reply
with
his
accustomary
mildness
to
all
her
inquiry
,
but
without

her
in
any

<EOS>
Elinor
now
begin

<EOS>
after
her
entrance
,
Colonel
Brandon
become
more
thoughtful
and
silent
than
he
have

and
Mrs.
Jennings
could
not
prevail
on
him
to
stay
long
.
<EOS>
no

evening

and
the

be
unanimous
in
agree
to
go
early
to
bed

They
have
not

finish
their
breakfast
before
Mrs.

barouche
stop
at
the
door
,
and
in
a
few
minute
she
come
laugh
into
the
room
:
so
delighted
to
see
them
all
,
that
it
be
hard
to
say
whether
she
receive
most
pleasure
from
meet
her
mother
or
the
Miss
Dashwoods
again
.
<EOS>
so
surprised
at
their

so
angry
at
their

though
at
the

time
she

<EOS>
"
Mr.

"
what

<EOS>
I
forget
what
it

something
so
droll

"
  
<EOS>
after
an
hour
or
two
spend
in
what
her
mother
call
comfortable
chat
,
or
in
other
word
,
in
every
variety
of
inquiry
concern
all
their
acquaintance
on
Mrs.
Jennings
's
side
,
and
in
laughter
without
cause
on
Mrs.
Palmer
's
,
it
be
propose
by
the
latter
that
they
should
all
accompany
her
to
some
shop
where
she
have
business
that
morning
,
to
which
Mrs.
Jennings
and
Elinor
readily
consent
,
as
have
likewise
some
purchase
to
make
themselves
;

Marianne
,
though
decline
it
at
first
be
induce
to
go
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
wherever
they
go
,
she
be
evidently
always
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
in
Bond
Street
especially
,
where
much
of
their
business
lie
,
her
eye
be
in
constant
inquiry
;
and
in
whatever
shop
the
party
be
engage
,
her
mind
be
equally
abstract
from
every
thing
actually
before
them
,
from
all
that
interested
and
occupy
the
other

<EOS>
restless
and
dissatisfy
every
<EOS>
where
,
her
sister
could
never
obtain
her
opinion
of
any
article
of
purchase
,
however
it
may
equally
concern
them
both
:
she
receive
no
pleasure
from
anything
;
be
only
impatient
to
be
at
home
again
,
and
could
with
difficulty
govern
her
vexation
at
the
tediousness
of
Mrs.
Palmer
,
whose
eye
be
catch
by
every
thing
pretty
,
expensive
,
or
new
;
who
be
wild
to
buy
all
,
could
determine
on
none
,
and
dawdle
away
her
time
in
rapture
and
indecision
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
late
in
the
morning
before
they
return
home
;
and
no
sooner
have
they
enter
the
house
than
Marianne
fly
eagerly
up
stair
,
and
when
Elinor
follow
,
she
find
her
turn
from
the
table
with
a
sorrowful
countenance
,
which
declare
that
no
Willoughby
have
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
no
letter
be
leave
here
for
me
since
we
go
out
?
"
say
she
to
the
footman
who
then
enter
with
the
parcel
.
<EOS>
She
be
answer
in
the
negative
.
"
<EOS>
be
you
quite
sure
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
certain
that
no
servant
,
no
porter
have
leave
any
letter
or
note
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
man
reply
that
none
have
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
odd
!
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
in
a
low
and
disappointed
voice
,
as
she
turn
away
to
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
odd
,
indeed
!
"
repeat
Elinor
within
herself
,
regard
her
sister
with
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"
if
she
have
not
know
him
to
be
in
town
she
would
not
have
write
to
him
,
as
she
do
;
she
would
have
write
to
Combe
Magna
;
and
if
he
be
in
town
,
how
odd
that
he
should
neither
come
nor
write
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
mother
,
you
must
be
wrong
in
permit
an
engagement
between
a
daughter
so
young
,
a
man
so
little
known
,
to
be
carry
on
in
so
doubtful
,
so
mysterious
a
manner
!
<EOS>
I
long
to
inquire
;
and
how
will
_
my
_
interference
be
bear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
determine
,
after
some
consideration
,
that
if
appearance
continue
many
day
longer
as
unpleasant
as
they
now
be
,
she
would
represent
in
the
strong
manner
to

<EOS>
Marianne
be
of
no
use
on
these
occasion

as
she
would
never
learn
the
game
;
but
though
her
time
be

at
her

the
evening
be
by
no

more
productive
of

She

pause
for
a
moment
whenever
she
come
to

<EOS>
poor
soul

<EOS>
I

I

it

<EOS>
at
this
time
of
the

after
such
a
series
of
rain
,
we
shall
certainly
have
very
little
more
of

<EOS>
frost
will
soon
set
in
,
and
in
all
probability
with
severity
.
<EOS>
in
another
day

two

;
this
extreme

perhaps
it

freeze
tonight

<EOS>

at

I

warrant
you

<EOS>
Mary

her
own
way

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
"
silently
conjecture
Elinor
,
"
she
will
write
to
Combe
by
this
day
's
post
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
if
she

,
the
letter
be
write
and
send
away
with
a
privacy
which
elude
all
her
watchfulness
to
ascertain
the
fact
.
<EOS>
whatever
the
truth
of
it
may
be
,
and
far
as
Elinor
be
from
feel
thorough
contentment
about
it
,
yet
while
she
see
Marianne
in
spirit
,
she
could
not
be
very
uncomfortable
herself
.
<EOS>
and
Marianne
be
in
spirit
;
happy
in
the
mildness
of
the
weather
,
and
still
happy
in
her
expectation
of
a
frost

<EOS>
the
morning
be
chiefly
spend
in
leave
card
at
the
house
of
Mrs.
Jennings

acquaintance
to
inform

of
her

Marianne
be
all
the
time
busy
in
observe
the
direction
of
the
wind
,
watch
the
variation
of
the

imagine
an
alteration
in

"
do
not
you
find

cold
than
it
be
in
the
morning

Elinor

<EOS>
there
seem
to
me
a
very
decide
difference
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
keep
my
hand
warm
even
in
my
muff
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
yesterday
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
the
cloud
seem
part
too
,
the
sun
will
be
out
in
a
moment
,
and
we
shall
have
a
clear
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
be
alternately
divert
and
pain
;
but
Marianne
persevere
,
and
see
every
night
in
the
brightness
of
the
fire
,
and
every
morning
in
the
appearance
of
the
atmosphere
,
the
certain
symptom
of
approach
frost
.
  
<EOS>
the
Miss
Dashwoods
have
no
great
reason
to
be
dissatisfy
with
Mrs.
Jennings
's
style
of
living
,
and
set
of
acquaintance
,
than
with
her
behaviour
to
themselves
,
which
be
invariably
kind
.
<EOS>
every
thing
in
her
household
arrangement
be
conduct
on
the
most
liberal
plan
,
and
except
a
few
old
city
friend
,
whom
,
to
Lady
Middleton
's
regret
,
she
have
never
drop
,
she
visit
no
one
to
whom
an
introduction
could
at
all
discompose
the
feeling
of
her
young
companion
.
<EOS>
pleased
to
find
herself
more
comfortably
situate
in
that
particular
than
she
have
expect
,
Elinor
be
very
willing
to
compound
for
the
want
of
much
real
enjoyment
from
any
of
their
evening
party
,
which
,
whether
at
home
or
abroad
,
form
only
for
card
,
could
have
little
to
amuse
her
.
  
<EOS>
Colonel
Brandon
,
who
have
a
general
invitation
to
the
house
,
be
with
them
almost
every
day
;
he
come
to
look
at
Marianne
and
talk
to
Elinor
,
who
often
derive
more
satisfaction
from
converse
with
him
than
from
any
other
daily
occurrence
,
but
who
see
at
the
same
time
with
much
concern
his
continue
regard
for
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
fear
it
be
a
strengthening
regard
.
<EOS>
It
grieve
her
to
see
the
earnestness
with
which
he
often
watch
Marianne
,
and
his
spirit
be
certainly
bad
than
when
at
Barton
.
  
<EOS>
about
a
week
after
their
arrival
,
it
become
certain
that
Willoughby
be
also
arrive
.
<EOS>
His
card
be
on
the
table
when
they
come
in
from
the
morning
's
drive
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
God
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Marianne
,
"
he
have
be
here
while
we
be
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Elinor
,
rejoice
to
be
assure
of
his
being
in
London
,
now
venture
to
say
,
"
depend
upon
it
,
he
will
call
again
tomorrow
.
"
<EOS>
but
Marianne
seem
hardly
to
hear
her
,
and
on
Mrs.
Jennings
's
entrance
,
escape
with
the
precious
card
.
  
<EOS>
this
event
,
while
it
raise
the
spirit
of
Elinor
,
restore
to
those
of
her
sister
all
,
and
more
than
all
,
their
former
agitation
.
<EOS>
from
this
moment
her
mind
be
never
quiet
;
the
expectation
of
see
him
every
hour
of
the
day
,
make
her
unfit
for
any
thing
.
<EOS>
She
insist
on
be
leave
behind
,
the
next
morning
,
when
the
other
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
's
thought
be
full
of
what
may
be
pass
in
Berkeley
Street
during
their
absence
;
but
a
moment
's
glance
at
her
sister
when
they
return
be
enough
to
inform
her
,
that
Willoughby
have
pay
no
second
visit
there
.
<EOS>
a
note
be
just
then
bring
in
,

lay
on
the

"
for

step
hastily
forward

<EOS>
"
no

madam

for
my
mistress

"
  
<EOS>
but
Marianne
,
not
convinced
,
take
it
instantly
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
indeed
for
Mrs.
Jennings
;
how
provoking
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
expect
a
letter

then
?
<EOS>
"
say
Elinor

unable
to
be

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
a
little
 
not

after

short
pause

"
You

Nay

this
reproach
from

you

you
who
have
confidence

"
  
<EOS>
"
Me

return
Elinor
in
some
confusion
;
"
indeed
,
Marianne
,
I
have
nothing
to
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
I
,
"
answer
Marianne
with
energy
,
"
our
situation
then
be
alike
.
<EOS>
We
have
neither
of
us
any
thing
to
tell
;
you
,
because
you
do
not
communicate
,
and
I
,
because
I
conceal
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
,
distress
by
this
charge
of
reserve
in
herself
,
which
she
be
not
at
liberty
to
do
away
,
know
not
how
,
under
such
circumstance
,
to
press
for
great
openness
in
Marianne
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
soon
appear
,
and
the
note
be
give
her
,
she
read
it
aloud
.
<EOS>
It
be
from
Lady
Middleton
,
announce
their
arrival
in
Conduit
Street
the
night
before
,
and
request
the
company
of
her
mother
and
cousin
the
follow
evening
.
<EOS>
business
on
Sir
John
's
part
,
and
a
violent
cold
on
her
own
,
prevent
their
calling
in
Berkeley
Street
.
<EOS>
the
invitation
be
accept
;
but
when
the
hour
of
appointment
draw
near
,
necessary
as
it
be
in
common
civility
to
Mrs.
Jennings
,
that
they
should
both
attend
her
on
such
a
visit
,
Elinor
have
some
difficulty
in
persuade
her
sister
to
go
,
for
still
she
have
see
nothing
of
Willoughby
;
and
therefore
be
not
more
indisposed
for
amusement
abroad
,
than
unwilling
to
run
the
risk
of
his
call
again
in
her
absence
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
find
,
when
the
evening
be
over
,
that
disposition
be
not
materially
alter
by
a
change
of
abode
,
for
although
scarcely
settle
in
town
,
Sir
John
have
contrive
to
collect
around
him
,
nearly
twenty
young
people
,
and
to
amuse
them
with
a
ball
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
affair
,
however
,
of
which
Lady
Middleton
do
not
approve
.
<EOS>
in
the
country
,
an
unpremeditated
dance
be
very
allowable
;
but
in
London
,
where
the
reputation
of
elegance
be
more
important
and
less
easily
attain
,
it
be
risk
too
much
for
the
gratification
of
a
few
girl
,
to
have
it
know
that
Lady
Middleton
have
give
a
small
dance
of
eight
or
nine
couple
,
with
two
violin
,
and
a
mere
side
-
board
collation
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Palmer
be
of
the
party
;
from
the
former
,
whom
they
have
not
see
before
since
their
arrival
in
town
,
as
he
be
careful
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
any
attention
to
his
mother
-
in
-
law
,
and
therefore
never
come
near
her
,
they
receive
no
mark
of
recognition
on
their
entrance
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
them
slightly
,
without
seem
to
know
who
they
be
,
and
merely
nod
to
Mrs.
Jennings
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Marianne
give
one
glance
round
the
apartment
as
she
enter
:
it
be
enough
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
he
_
be
not
there
 
<EOS>
and
she
sit
down
,
equally
ill
-
disposed
to
receive
or
communicate
pleasure
.
<EOS>
after
they
have
be
assemble
about
an
hour
,
Mr.
Palmer
saunter
towards
the
Miss
Dashwoods
to
express
his
surprise
on
see
them
in
town
,
though
Colonel
Brandon
have
be
first
inform
of
their
arrival
at
his
house
,
and
he
have
himself
say
something
very
droll
on
hear
that
they
be
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
both
in
Devonshire
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
?
"
reply
Elinor
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
do
you
go
back
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
.
"
<EOS>
and
thus
end
their
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
never
have
Marianne
be
so
unwilling
to
dance
in
her
life
,
as
she
be
that
evening
,
and
never
so
much
fatigue
by
the
exercise
.
<EOS>
She
complain
of
it
as
they
return
to
Berkeley
Street
.
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
aye
,
"
say
Mrs.
Jennings
,
"
we
know
the
reason
of
all
that
very
well
;
if
a
certain
person
who
shall
be
nameless
,
have
be
there
,
you
would
not
have
be
a
bit
tired
:
and
to
say
the
truth
it
be
not
very
pretty
of
him
not
to
give
you
the
meeting
when
he
be
invite

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
invite
!
"
cry
Marianne
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
my
daughter
Middleton
tell
me
,
for
it
seem
Sir
John
meet
him
somewhere
in
the
street
this
morning
.
"
<EOS>
Marianne
say
no
more
,
but
look
exceedingly
hurt
.
<EOS>
impatient
in
this
situation
to
be
do
something
that
may
lead
to
her
sister
's
relief
,
Elinor
resolve
to
write
the
next
morning
to
her
mother
,
and
hope
by
awaken
her
fear
for
the
health
of
Marianne
,
to
procure
those
inquiry
which
have
be
so
long
delay
;
and
she
be
still
more
eagerly
bent
on
this
measure
by
perceive
after
breakfast
on
the
morrow
,
that
Marianne
be
again
write
to
Willoughby
,
for
she
could
not
suppose
it
to
be
to
any
other
person
.
  
<EOS>
about
the
middle
of
the
day
,
Mrs.
Jennings
go
out
by
herself
on
business
,
and
Elinor
begin
her
letter
directly
,
while
Marianne
,
too
restless
for
employment
,
too
anxious
for
conversation
,
walk
from
one
window
to
the
other
,
or
sit
down
by
the
fire
in
melancholy
meditation
.
<EOS>
Elinor
be
very
earnest
in
her
application
to
her
mother
,
relate
all
that
have
pass
,
her
suspicion
of
Willoughby
's
inconstancy
,
urge
her
by
every
plea
of
duty
and
affection
to
demand
from
Marianne
an
account
of
her
real
situation
with
respect
to
him

<EOS>
Her
letter
be
scarcely

when
a
rap

a
visitor

and
Colonel
Brandon
be
announce

<EOS>
Marianne

who
have
see
him
from
the
window
,
and
who
hate
company
of
any
kind
,
leave
the
room
before
he
enter
it
.
<EOS>
He
look
more
than
usually
grave
,
and
though
express
satisfaction
at
find
Miss
Dashwood
alone
,
as
if
he
have
somewhat
in
particular
to
tell
her

sit
for
some
time
without

a

<EOS>
Elinor

some
communication
to

<EOS>
It
be
not
the
first
time
of
her
feel
the

kind
of
conviction
;
for
,
more
than
once
before
,
begin
with
the
observation
of
"
your

unwell
to

day
,
"
or
"
your

<EOS>
after
a
pause
of
several
minute
,
their
silence
be
break
,
by
his
ask
her
in
a
voice
of
some
agitation
,
when
he
be
to
congratulate
her
on
the
acquisition
of
a
brother
?
<EOS>
Elinor
be
not
prepare
for
such
a
question
,
and
have
no
answer
ready
,
be
oblige
to
adopt
the
simple
and
common
expedient
,
of
ask
what
he
mean
?
<EOS>
He
try
to
smile
as
he
reply
,
"
your
sister
's
engagement
to
Mr.
Willoughby
be
very
generally
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
generally
know
,
"
return
Elinor
,
"
for
her
own
family
do
not
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
surprised
and
say
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
I
be
afraid
my
inquiry
have
be
impertinent
;
but
I
have
not
suppose
any
secrecy
intend
,
as
they
openly
correspond
,
and
their
marriage
be
universally
talk
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
that
be
?
<EOS>
by
whom
can
you
have
hear
it
mention
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
many
 
by
some
of
whom
you
know
nothing
,
by
other
with
whom
you
be
most
intimate
,
Mrs.
Jennings
,
Mrs.
Palmer
,
and
the
Middletons
.
<EOS>
but
still
I
may
not
have
believe
it
,
for
where
the
mind
be
perhaps
rather
unwilling
to
be
convince
,
it
will
always
find
something
to
support
its
doubt
,
if
I
have
not
,
when
the
servant
let
me
in
today
,
accidentally
see
a
letter
in
his
hand
,
direct
to
Mr.
Willoughby
in
your
sister
's
writing

<EOS>
I
come
to
inquire
,
but
I
be
convince
before
I
could
ask
the
question
.
<EOS>
be
every
thing
finally
settle
?
<EOS>
be
it
impossible
to-
?
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
right
,
and
I
could
have
no
chance
of
succeed
.
<EOS>
excuse
me
,
Miss
Dashwood
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
be
wrong
in
say
so
much
,
but
I
hardly
know
what
to
do
,
and
on
your
prudence
I
have
the
strong
dependence
.
<EOS>
tell
me
that
it
be
all
absolutely
resolve
on
,
that
any
attempt
,
that
in
short
concealment
,
if
concealment
be
possible

be
all
that
remain

"
  
<EOS>
these
word
,
which
convey
to
Elinor
a
direct
avowal
of
his
love
for
her
sister
,
affect
her
very
much
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
immediately
able
to
say
anything
,
and
even
when
her
spirit
be
recover
,
she
debate
for
a
short
time
,
<EOS>
on
the
answer
it
would
be
most
proper
to
give
.
<EOS>
the
real
state
of
thing
between
Willoughby
and
her
sister
be
so
little
known
to
herself
,
that
in
endeavour
to
explain
it
,
she
may
be
as
liable
to
say
too
much
as
too
little
.
<EOS>
yet
as
she
be
convince
that
Marianne
's
affection
for
Willoughby
,
could
leave
no
hope
of
Colonel
Brandon
's
success
,
whatever
the
event
of
that
affection
may
be
,
and
at
the
same
time
wish
to
shield
her
conduct
from
censure
,
she
think
it
most
prudent
and
kind
,
after
some
consideration
,
to
say
more
than
she
really
know
or
believe
.
<EOS>
She
acknowledge
,
therefore
,
that
though
she
have
never
be
inform
by
themselves
of
the
term
on
which
they
stand
with
each
other
,
of
their
mutual
affection
<EOS>
she
have
no
doubt
,
and
of
their
correspondence
she
be
not
astonished
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
He
listen
to
her
with
silent
attention
,
and
on
her
cease
to
speak
,
rise
directly
from
his
seat
,
and
after
say
in
a
voice
of
emotion
,
"
to
your
sister
I
wish
all
imaginable
happiness
;
to
Willoughby
that
he
may
endeavour
to
deserve
her
,
"
 
take
leave
,
and
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
derive
no
comfortable
feeling
from
this
conversation
,
to
lessen
the
uneasiness
of
her
mind
on
other
point
;
she
be
leave
,
on
the
contrary
,
with
a
melancholy
impression
of
Colonel
Brandon
's
unhappiness
,
and
be
prevent
even
from
wish
it
remove
,
by
her
anxiety
for
the
very
event
that
must
confirm
it
.
    
<EOS>
nothing
occur
during
the
next
three
or
four
day
,
to
make
Elinor
regret
what
she
have
do
,
in
apply
to
her
mother
;
for
Willoughby
neither
come
nor
write
.
<EOS>
They
be
engage
about
the
end
of
that
time
to
attend
Lady
Middleton
to
a
party
,
from
which
Mrs.
Jennings
be
keep
away
by
the
indisposition
of
her
young
daughter
;
and
for
this
party
,
Marianne
,
wholly
dispirit
,
careless
of
her
appearance
,
and
seem
equally
indifferent
whether
she
go
or
staid
,
prepared
,
without
one
look
of
hope
or
one
expression
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
sit
by
the
drawing
-
room
fire
after
tea
,
till
the
moment
of
Lady
Middleton
's
arrival
,
without
once
stir
from
her
seat
,
or
alter
her
attitude
,
lose
in
her
own
thought
,
and
insensible
of
her
sister
's
presence
;
and
when
at
last
they
be
tell
that
Lady
Middleton
wait
for
them
at
the
door
,
she
start
as
if
she
have
forget
that
any
one
be
expect
.
  
<EOS>
They
arrive
in
due
time
at
the
place
of
destination
,
and
as
soon
as
the
string
of
carriage
before
them
would
allow
,
alight
,
ascend
the
stair
,
hear
their
name
announce
from
one
landing
-
place
to
another
in
an
audible
voice
,
and
enter
a
room
splendidly
light
up
,
quite
full
of
company
,
and
insufferably
hot
.
<EOS>
when
they
have
pay
their
tribute
of
politeness
by
curtsy
to
the
lady
of
the
house
,
they
be
permit
to
mingle
in
the
crowd
,
and
take
their
share
of
the
heat
and
inconvenience
,
to
which
their
arrival
must
necessarily
add
.
<EOS>
after
some
time
spend
in
say
little
or
do
less
,
Lady
Middleton
sit
down
to
Cassino
,
and
as
Marianne
be
not
in
spirit
for
move
about
,
she
and
Elinor
luckily
succeed
to
chair
,
place
themselves
at
no
great
distance
from
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
remain
in
this
manner
long
,
before
Elinor
perceive
Willoughby
,
stand
within
a
few
yard
of
them
,
in
earnest
conversation
with
a
very
fashionable
look
young
woman
.
<EOS>
She
soon
catch
his
eye
,
and
he
immediately
bow
,
but
without
attempt
to
speak
to
her
,
or
to
approach
Marianne
,
though
he
could
not
but
see
her
;
and
then
continue
his
discourse
with
the
same
lady
.
<EOS>
Elinor
turn
involuntarily
to
Marianne
,
to
see
whether
it
could
be
unobserved
by
her
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
she
first
perceive
him
,
and
her
whole
countenance
glow
with
sudden
delight
,
she
would
have
move
towards
him
instantly
,
have
not
her
sister
catch
hold
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
"
he
be
there
 
he
be
there
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
why
do
he
not
look
at
me
?
<EOS>
why
can
not
I
speak
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
pray
,
pray
be
compose
,
"
cry
Elinor
,
"
and
do
not
betray
what
you
feel
to
every
body
present
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
not
observe
you
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
however
be
more
than
she
could
believe
herself
;
and
to
be
compose
at
such
a
moment
<EOS>
be
not
only
beyond
the
reach
of
Marianne
<EOS>
,
it
be
beyond
her
wish
.
<EOS>
She
sit
in
an
agony
of
impatience
which
affect
every
feature
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
turn
round
again
,
and
regard
them
both
;
she
start
up
,
and
pronounce
his
name
in
a
tone
of
affection
,
hold
out
her
hand
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
approach
,
and
address
himself
rather
to
Elinor
than
Marianne
,
as
if
wish
to
avoid
her
eye
,
and
determine
not
to
observe
her
attitude
,
inquire
in
a
hurried
manner
after
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
and
ask
how
long
they
have
be
in
town
.
<EOS>
Elinor
be
rob
of
all
presence
of
mind
by
such
an
address
,
and
be
unable
to
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
but
the
feeling
of
her
sister
be
instantly
express
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
crimson
over
,
and
she
exclaim
,
in
a
voice
of
the
great
emotion
,
"
good
God
!
<EOS>
Willoughby
,
what
be
the
meaning
of
this
?
<EOS>
have
you
not
receive
my
letter
?
<EOS>
Will
you
not
shake
hand
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
then
avoid
it
,
but
her
touch
seem
painful
to
him
,
and
he
hold
her
hand
only
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
during
all
this
time
he
be
evidently
struggle
for
composure
.
<EOS>
Elinor
watch
his
countenance
and
see
its
expression
become
more
tranquil
.
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
he
speak
with
calmness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
myself
the
honour
of
call
in
Berkeley
Street
last
Tuesday
,
and
very
much
regretted
that
I
be
not
fortunate
enough
to
find
yourself
and
Mrs.
Jennings
at
home
.
<EOS>
My
card
be
not
lose
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
have
you
not
receive
my
note
?
"
cry
Marianne
in
the
wildest
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
be
some
mistake
I
be
sure
 
<EOS>
some
dreadful
mistake
.
<EOS>
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
it
?
<EOS>
tell
me
,
Willoughby
;
for
heaven
's
sake
tell
me
,
what
be
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
make
no
reply
;
his
complexion
change
and
all
his
embarrassment
return
;
but
as
if
,
on
catch
the
eye
of
the
young
lady
with
whom
he
have
be
previously
talk
,
he
feel
the
necessity
of
instant
exertion
,
he
recover
himself
again
,
and
after
say
,
"
yes
,
I
have
the
pleasure
of
receive
the
information
of
your
arrival
in
town
,
which
you
be
so
good
as
to
send
me
,
"
turn
hastily
away
with
a
slight
bow
and
join
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
,
now
look
dreadfully
white
,
and
unable
to
stand
,
sink
into
her
chair
,
and
Elinor
,
expect
every
moment
to
see
her
faint
,
try
to
screen
her
from
the
observation
of
other
,
while
revive
her
with
lavender
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
to
him
,
Elinor
,
"
she
cry
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
,
"
and
force
him
to
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
tell
him
I
must
see
him
again
 
must
speak
to
him
instantly
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
rest
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
have
a
moment
's
peace
till
this
be
explain
 
some
dreadful
misapprehension
or
other
.
<EOS>
oh
,
go
to
him
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
that
be
do
?
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
Marianne
,
you
must
wait
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
place
for
explanation
.
<EOS>
wait
only
till
tomorrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
difficulty
however
could
she
prevent
her
from
follow
him
herself
;
and
to
persuade
her
to
check
her
agitation
,
to
wait
,
at
least
,
with
the
appearance
of
composure
,
till
she
may
speak
to
him
with
more
privacy
and
more
effect
,
be
impossible
;
for
Marianne
continue
incessantly
to
give
way
in
a
low
voice
to
the
misery
of
her
feeling
,
by
exclamation
of
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
in
a
short
time
Elinor
see
Willoughby
quit
the
room
by
the
door
towards
the
staircase
,
and
tell
Marianne
that
he
be
go
,
urge
the
impossibility
of
speak
to
him
again
that
evening
,
as
a
fresh
argument
for
her
to
be
calm
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
beg
her
sister
would
entreat
Lady
Middleton
to
take
them
home
,
as
she
be
too
miserable
to
stay
a
minute
longer
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
,
though
in
the
middle
of
a
rubber
,
on
be
inform
that
Marianne
be
unwell
,
be
too
polite
to
object
for
a
moment
to
her
wish
of
go
away
,
and
make
over
her
card
to
a
friend
,
they
depart
as
soon
as
the
carriage
could
be
find
.
<EOS>
scarcely
a
word
be
speak
during
their
return
to
Berkeley
Street
.
<EOS>
Marianne
be
in
a
silent
agony
,
too
much
oppress
even
for
tear
;
but
as
Mrs.
Jennings
be
luckily
not
come
home
,
they
could
go
directly
to
their
own
room
,
where
hartshorn
restore
her
a
little
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
be
soon
undress
and
in
bed
,
and
as
she
seem
desirous
of
be
alone
,
her
sister
then
leave
her
,
and
while
she
wait
the
return
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
have
leisure
enough
for
think
over
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
that
some
kind
of
engagement
have
subsist
between
Willoughby
and
Marianne
she
could
not
doubt
,
and
that
Willoughby
be
weary
of
it
,
seem
equally
clear
;
for
however
Marianne
may
still
feed
her
own
wish
,
_
she
_
could
not
attribute
such
behaviour
to
mistake
or
misapprehension
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
a
thorough
change
of
sentiment
could
account
for
it
.
<EOS>
Her
indignation
would
have
be
still
strong
than
it
be
,
have
she
not
witness
that
embarrassment
which
seem
to
speak
a
consciousness
of
his
own
misconduct
,
and
prevent
her
from
believe
him
so
unprincipled
as
to
have
be
sport
with
the
affection
of
her
sister
from
the
first
,
without
any
design
that
would
bear
investigation
.
<EOS>
absence
may
have
weaken
his
regard
,
and
convenience
may
have
determine
him
to
overcome
it
,
but
that
such
a
regard
have
formerly
exist
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Marianne
,
on
the
pang
which
so
unhappy
a
meeting
must
already
have
give
her
,
and
on
those
still
more
severe
which
may
await
her
in
its
probable
consequence
,
she
could
not
reflect
without
the
deep
concern
.
<EOS>
Her
own
situation
gain
in
the
comparison
;
for
while
she
could
_
esteem
_
Edward
as
much
as
ever
,
however
they
may
be
divide
in
future
,
her
mind
may
be
always
support
.
<EOS>
but
every
circumstance
that
could
embitter
such
an
evil
seem
unite
to
heighten
the
misery
of
Marianne
in
a
final
separation
from
Willoughby
 
in
an
immediate
and
irreconcilable
rupture
with
him
.
    
<EOS>
before
the
housemaid
have
light
their
fire
the
next
day
,
or
the
sun
gain
any
power
over
a
cold
,
gloomy
morning
in
January
,
Marianne
,
only
half
dress
,
be
kneel
against
one
of
the
window
-
seat
for
the
sake
of
all
the
little
light
she
could
command
from
it
,
and
write
as
fast
as
a
continual
flow
of
tear
would
permit
her
.
<EOS>
in
this
situation
,
Elinor
,
rouse
from
sleep
by
her
agitation
and
sobs
,
first
perceive
her
;
and
after
observe
her
for
a
few
moment
with
silent
anxiety
,
say
,
in
a
tone
of
the
most
considerate
gentleness
    
"
Marianne

<EOS>
the
sort
of
desperate
calmness
with
which
this
be
say
,
last
no
longer
than
while
she
speak
,
and
be
immediately
follow
by
a
return
of
the
same
excessive
affliction
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
minute
before
she
could
go
on
with
her
letter
,
and
the
frequent
burst
of
grief
which
still
oblige
her
,
at
interval
,
to
withhold
her
pen
,
be
proofs
enough
of
her
feel
<EOS>
how
more
than
probable
it
be
that
she
be
write
for
the
last
time
to
Willoughby
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
pay
her
every
quiet
and
unobtrusive
attention
in
her
power
;
and
she
would
have
try
to
sooth
and
tranquilize
her
still
more
,
have
not
Marianne
entreat
her
,
with
all
the
eagerness
of
the
most
nervous
irritability
,
not
to
speak
to
her
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
in
such
circumstance
,
it
be
well
for
both
that
they
should
not
be
long
together
;
and
the
restless
state
of
Marianne
's
mind
not
only
prevent
her
from
remain
in
the
room
a
moment
after
she
be
dress
,
but
require
at
once
solitude
and
continual
change
of
place
,
make
her
wander
about
the
house
till
breakfast
time
,
avoid
the
sight
of
every
body
.
  
<EOS>
at
breakfast
she
neither
eat
,
nor
attempt
to
eat
any
thing
;
and
Elinor
's
attention
be
then
all
employ
,
not
in
urge
her
,
not
in
pity
her
,
nor
in
appear
to
regard
her
,
but
in
endeavour
to
engage
Mrs.
Jennings
's
notice
entirely
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
be
a
favourite
meal
with
Mrs.
Jennings
,
it
last
a
considerable
time
,
and
they
be
just
set
themselves
,
after
it
,
round
the
common
working
table
,
when
a
letter
be
deliver
to
Marianne
,
which
she
eagerly
catch
from
the
servant
,
and
,
turn
of
a
death
-
like
paleness
,
instantly
run
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Elinor
,
who
see
as
plainly
by
this
,
as
if
she
have
see
the
direction
,
that
it
must
come
from
Willoughby
,
feel
immediately
such
a
sickness
at
heart
as
make
her
hardly
able
to
hold
up
her
head
,
and
sit
in
such
a
general
tremor
as
make
her
fear
it
impossible
to
escape
Mrs.
Jennings
's
notice
.
<EOS>
that
good
lady
,
however
,
see
only
that
Marianne
have
receive
a
letter
from
Willoughby
,
which
appear
to
her
a
very
good
joke
,
and
which
she
treat
accordingly
,
by
hope
,
with
a
laugh
,
that
she
would
find
it
to
her
liking
.
<EOS>
of
Elinor
's
distress
,
she
be
too
busily
employ
in
measure
length
of
worst
for
her
rug
,
to
see
any
thing
at
all
;
and
calmly
continue
her
talk
,
as
soon
as
Marianne
disappear
,
she
say
    
"
upon
my
word
,
I
never
see
a
young
woman
so
desperately
in
love
in
my
life

<EOS>
My
_
girl
be
nothing
to
her
,
and
yet
they
use
to
be
foolish
enough
;
but
as
for
Miss
Marianne
,
she
be
quite
an
alter
creature
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
,
he
will
not
keep
her
wait
much
longer
,
for
it
be
quite
grievous
to
see
her
look
so
ill
and
forlorn
.
<EOS>
pray
,
when
be
they
to
be
marry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
,
though
never
less
disposed
to
speak
than
at
that
moment
,
oblige
herself
to
answer
such
an
attack
as
this
,
and
,
therefore
,
try
to
smile
,
reply
,
"
and
have
you
really
,
madam

talk
yourself
into
a
persuasion
of
my

?
<EOS>
I
think
it
have
be
only
a
joke
,
but
so
serious
a
question
seem
to
imply
more
;
and
I
must
beg
,
therefore
,
that
you
will
not
deceive
yourself
any
longer
.
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
that
nothing
would
surprise
me
more
than
to
hear
of
their
be
go
to
be
marry

<EOS>
"
  
"
for
shame
,
for
shame
,
Miss
Dashwood

<EOS>
how
can
you
talk
so
?
<EOS>
do
not
we
all
know
that
it
must
be
a
match
,
that
they
be
over
head
and
ear
in
love
with
each
other
from
the
first
moment
they
meet
?
<EOS>
do
not
I
see
them
together
in
Devonshire
every
day
,
and
all
day
long
;
and
do
not
I
know
that
your
sister
come
to
town
with
me
on
purpose
to
buy
wedding
clothe
?
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
this
will
not
do
.
<EOS>
because
you
be
so
sly
about
it
yourself
,
you
think
nobody
else
have
any
sense
;
but
it
be
no
such
thing
<EOS>
,
I
can
tell
you
,
for
it
have
be
know
all
over
town
this
ever
so
long

<EOS>
I
tell
every

of
it

so
do
Charlotte

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
"
say
Elinor
,
very
seriously
,
"
you
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
you
be
do
a
very
unkind
thing
in
spread
the
report

you
will
find
that
you
have

you
will
not

me
now

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
laugh
again
,
but
Elinor
have
not
spirit
to
say
more
,
and
eager
at
all
event
to
know
what
Willoughby
have
write
,
hurry
away
to
their
room
,
where
,
on
open
the
door
,
she
see
Marianne
stretch
on
the
bed
,
almost
choke
by
grief
,
one
letter
in
her
hand
,
and
two
or
three
other
lay
by
her
.
<EOS>
Elinor
draw
near
,
but
without
say
a
word
;
and
seat
herself
on
the
bed
,
take
her
hand
,
kiss
her
affectionately
several
time
,
and
then
give
way
to
a
burst
of
tear
,
which
at
first
be
scarcely
less
violent
than
Marianne
's
.
<EOS>
the
latter
,
though
unable
to
speak
,
seem
to
feel
all
the
tenderness
of
this
behaviour
,
and
after
some
time
thus
spend
in
joint
affliction
,
she
put
all
the
letter
into
Elinor
's
hand
;
and
then
cover
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
,
almost
scream
with
agony
.
<EOS>
Elinor
,
who
know
that
such
grief
,
shocking
as
it
be
to
witness
it
,
must
have
its
course
,
watch
by
her
till
this
excess
of
suffering
have
somewhat
spend
itself
,
and
then
turn
eagerly
to
Willoughby
's
letter
,
read
as
follow
:
    
"
Bond
Street
,
January
.
  
<EOS>
"
my
dear
madam
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
have
the
honour
of
receive
your
letter
,
for
which
I
beg
to
return
my
sincere
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
I
be
much
concerned
to
find
there
be
anything
in
my
behaviour
last
night
<EOS>
that
do
not
meet
your
approbation
;
and
though
I
be
quite
at
a
loss
to
discover
in
what
point
I
could
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
offend
you
,
I
entreat
your
forgiveness
of
what
I
can
assure
you
to
have
be
perfectly
unintentional
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
reflect
on
my
former
acquaintance
with
your
family
in
Devonshire
without
the
most
grateful
pleasure
,
and
flatter
myself
it
will
not
be
break
by
any
mistake
or
misapprehension
of
my
action
.
<EOS>
My
esteem
for
your
whole
family
be
very
sincere
;
but
if
I
have
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
give
rise
to
a
belief
of
more
than
I
feel
,
or
mean
to
express
,
I
shall
reproach
myself
for
not
have
be
more
guard
in
my
profession
of
that
esteem
.
<EOS>
that
I
should
ever
have
mean
more
you
will
allow
to
be
impossible
,
when
you
understand
that
my
affection
have
be
long
engage
elsewhere
,
and
it
will
not
be
many
week
,
I
believe
,
before
this
engagement
be
fulfil
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
great
regret
that
I
obey
your
command
in
return
the
letter
with
which
I
have
be
honour
from
you
,
and
the
lock
of
hair
,
which
you
so
obligingly
bestow
on
me
.

I

dear
Madam

Your
most
obedient
humble
servant
,
  
"
JOHN
WILLOUGHBY

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
what
indignation
such
a
letter
as
this
must
be
read
by
Miss
Dashwood
,
may
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
though
aware
,
before
she
begin
it
,
that
it
must
bring
a
confession
of
his
inconstancy
,
and
confirm
their
separation
for
ever
,
she
be
not
aware
that
such
language
could
be
suffer
to
announce
it
;
nor
could
she
have
suppose
Willoughby
capable
of
depart
so
far
from
the
appearance
of
every
honourable
and
delicate
feeling
 
so
far
from
the
common
decorum
of
a
gentleman
,
as
to
send
a
letter
so
impudently
cruel
:
a
letter
which
,
instead
of
bring
with
his
desire
of
a
release
any
profession
of
regret
,
acknowledge
no
breach
of
faith
,
deny
all
peculiar
affection
<EOS>
whatever
;
 
a
letter
of
which
every
line
be
an
insult
,
and
which
proclaim
its
writer
to
be
deep
in
harden
villainy
.
  
<EOS>
She
pause
over
it
for
some
time
with
indignant
astonishment
;
then
read
it
again
and
again
;
but
every
perusal
only
serve
to
increase
her
abhorrence
of
the
man
,
and
so
bitter
be
her
feeling
against
him
,
that
she
dare
not
trust
herself
to
speak
,
lest
she
may
wound
Marianne
still
deep
by
treat
their
disengagement
,
not
as
a
loss
to
her
of
any
possible
good
but
as
an
escape
from
the
bad
and
most
irremediable
of
all
evil
,
 
a
connection
,
for
life
,
with
an
unprincipled
man
,
as
a
deliverance
the
most
real
,
a
blessing
the
most
important
.
  
<EOS>
in
her
earnest
meditation
on
the
content
of
the
letter
,
on
the
depravity
of
that
mind
which
could
dictate
it
,
and
probably
,
on
the
very
different
mind
of
a
very
different
person
,
who
have
no
other
connection
<EOS>
whatever
with
the
affair
than
what
her
heart
give
him
with
every
thing
that
pass
,
Elinor
forget
the
immediate
distress
of
her
sister
,
forget
that
she
have
three
letter
on
her
lap
yet
unread
,
and
so
entirely
forget
how
long
she
have
be
in
the
room
,
that
when
on
hear
a
carriage
drive
up
to
the
door
,
she
go
to
the
window
to
see
who
could
be
come
so
unreasonably
early

she
be
all
astonishment
to
perceive
Mrs.

chariot

which
she

determine
not

hopeless

at

Mrs.

with

most
readily

after

safe
off

return
to

she
find
attempt

rise
from

reach
just
in

to
prevent
her
from
fall
on
the
floor
,
faint
and
giddy
from
a
long
want

food
;
for
it
be
many
day
since

now

the
fever
of

the
consequence
of
all
this
be
feel
in
an
ache

,
a
weaken
stomach
,

a
general
nervous
faintness

glass
of
wine

more
comfortable

this
,
as
every
thing
else
would
have
be
,
be
too
much
for
Marianne

who
could

I

my
disappointment

nor
my
astonishment

note

I

call
again

<EOS>
You
have
better
come
earlier
another
time
,
because
we
be
generally
out

We
be
last
night
at

there

I
have
be
tell
that
you

could
it
be
so
?

You
must

very

alter

part

last
note

what
be
I
to
imagine
,
Willoughby
,
by
your
behaviour
last
night
?
<EOS>
again
I
demand
an
explanation
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
prepared
to
meet
you
with
the
pleasure
which
our
separation
naturally
produce
,
 
with
the
familiarity
which
our
intimacy
at
Barton
appear
to
me
to
justify
.
<EOS>
I
be
repulse
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
have
pass
a
wretched
night
in
endeavour
to
excuse
a
conduct
which
can
scarcely
be
call
less
than
insult
;
but
though
I
have
not
yet
be
able
to
form
any
reasonable
apology
for
your
behaviour
,
I
be
perfectly
ready
to
hear
your
justification
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
perhaps
be
misinform
,
or
purposely
deceive
,
in
something
concern
me
,
which
may
have
lower
me
in
your
opinion
.
<EOS>
tell
me
what
it
be
,
explain
the
ground
on
which
you
act
,
and
I
shall
be
satisfied
,
in
be
able
to
satisfy
you
.
<EOS>
It
would
grieve
me
indeed
to
be
oblige
to
think
ill
of
you
;
but
if
I
be
to
do
it
,
if
I
be
to
learn
that
you
be
not
what
we
have
hitherto
<EOS>
believe
you
,
that
your
regard
for
us
all
be
insincere
,
that
your
behaviour
to
me
be
intend
only
to
deceive
,
let
it
be
tell
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
My
feeling
be
at
present
in
a
state
of
dreadful
indecision
;
I
wish
to
acquit
you
,
but
certainty
on
either
side
will
be
ease
to
what
I
now
suffer
.
<EOS>
if
your
sentiment
be
no
longer
what
they
be
,
you
will
return
my
note
,
and
the
lock
of
my
hair
which
be
in
your
possession

ease

in
restless
pain

mind

body
she
move
from
one
posture

till
grow
more

more
hysterical

answer

well

all
I
can

be
,
that
if

he
have
use
a
young

abominably
ill

I
wish
with
all
my
soul
his
wife
may
plague
his
heart
out

so
I
shall
always
say

you
may
depend

have
no
notion
of
man

go
on

if
ever
I
meet

again

I
will
give
him
such
a
dressing
as
he
have
not
have
this
many
a
day

there
be
one
comfort

my

he
be
not

well

will
not

then
go
away

walk
on
tiptoe
out

down

the
bustle
about
her
would
be
less
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Elinor
,
please
to
have
her
govern
for
a
moment
by
such
a
motive
,
though
believe
it
hardly
possible
that
she
could
sit
out
the
dinner
,
say
no
more
;
and
adjust
her
dress
for
her
as
well
as
she
could
,
while
Marianne
still
remain
on
the
bed
,
be
ready
to
assist
her
into
the
dining
room
as
soon
as
they
be
summon
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
there
,
though
look
most
wretchedly
,
she
eat
more
and
be
calm
than
her
sister
have
expect
.
<EOS>
have
she
try
to
speak
,
or
have
she
be
conscious
of
half
Mrs.
Jennings
's
well
-
mean
but
ill
-
judge
attention
to
her
,
this
calmness
could
not
have
be
maintain
;
but
not
a
syllable
escape
her
lip
;
and
the
abstraction
of
her
thought
preserve
her
in
ignorance
of
every
thing
that
be
pass
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
,
who
do
justice
to
Mrs.
Jennings
's
kindness
,
though
its
effusion
be
often
distress
,
and
sometimes
almost
ridiculous
,
make
her
those
acknowledgment
,
and
return
her
those
civility
,
which
her
sister
could
not
make
or
return
for
herself
.
<EOS>
Their
good
friend
see
that
Marianne
be
unhappy
,
and
feel
that
every
thing
be
due
to
her
which
may
make
her
at
all
less
so
.
<EOS>
She
treat
her
therefore
,
with
all
the
indulgent
fondness
of
a
parent
towards
a
favourite
child
on
the
last
day
of
its
holiday
.
<EOS>
Marianne
be
to
have
the
good
place
by
the
fire
,
be
to
be
tempt
to
eat
by
every
delicacy
in
the
house
,
and
to
be
amuse
by
the
relation
of
all
the
news
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
have
not
Elinor
,
in
the
sad
countenance
of
her
sister
,
see
a
check
to
all
mirth
,
she
could
have
be
entertain
by
Mrs.
Jennings
's
endeavour
to
cure
a
disappointment
in
love
,
by
a
variety
of
sweetmeat
and
olive
,
and
a
good
fire
.
<EOS>
as
soon
,
however
,
as
the
consciousness
of
all
this
be
force
by
continual
repetition
on
Marianne
,
she
could
stay
no
longer
.
<EOS>
with
a
hasty
exclamation
of
misery
,
and
a
sign
to
her
sister
not
to
follow
her
,
she
directly
get
up
and
hurry
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
"
cry
Mrs.
Jennings
,
as
soon
as
she
be
go
,
"
how
it
grieve
me
to
see
her
!
<EOS>
and
I
declare
if
she
be
not
go
away
without
finish
her
wine
!
<EOS>
and
the
dry
cherry
too
!
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
nothing
seem
to
do
her
any
good
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
if
I
know
of
any
thing
she
would
like
,
I
would
send
all
over
the
town
for
it
.
<EOS>
well
,
it
be
the
odd
thing
to
me
,
that
a
man
should
use
such
a
pretty
girl
so
ill
!
<EOS>
but
when
there
be
plenty
of
money
on
one
side
,
and
next
to
none
on
the
other
,
Lord
bless
you
!
<EOS>
they
care
no
more
about
such
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
lady
then
,
 
Miss
Grey
<EOS>
I
think
you
call
her
,
 
be
very
rich
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
fifty
thousand
pound
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
see
her
?
<EOS>
a
smart
,
stylish
girl
they
say
,
but
not
handsome
.
<EOS>
I
remember
her
aunt
very
well
,
Biddy
Henshawe
;
she
marry
a
very
wealthy
man
.
<EOS>
but
the
family
be
all
rich
together
.
<EOS>
fifty
thousand
pound
!
<EOS>
and
by
all
account
,
it
will
not
come
before
it
be
want
;
for
they
say
he
be
all
to
piece
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
!
<EOS>
dash
about
with
his
curricle
and
hunter
!
<EOS>
well
,
it
do
not
signify
talk
;
but
when
a
young
man
,
be
who
he
will
,
come
and
make
love
to
a
pretty
girl
,
and
promise
marriage
,
he
have
no
business
to
fly
off
from
his
word
only
because
he
grow
poor
,
and
a
rich
girl
be
ready
to
have
him
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
he
,
in
such
a
case
,
sell
his
horse
,
let
his
house
,
turn
off
his
servant
,
and
make
a
thorough
reform
at
once
?
<EOS>
I
warrant
you
,
Miss
Marianne
would
have
be
ready
to
wait
till
matter
come
round
.
<EOS>
but
that
will
not
do
nowadays
;
nothing
in
the
way
of
pleasure
can
ever
be
give
up
by
the
young
man
of
this
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
what
kind
of
a
girl
Miss
Grey
be
?
<EOS>
be
she
say
to
be
amiable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
any
harm
of
her
;
indeed
I
hardly
ever
hear
her
mention
;
except
that
Mrs.
Taylor
do
say
this
morning
,
that
one
day
Miss
Walker
hint
to
her
,
that
she
believe
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Ellison
would
not
be
sorry
to
have
Miss
Grey
marry
,
for
she
and
Mrs.

could
never
agree
.

"
<EOS>
and
who
be
the
ellison
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
guardian
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
but
now
she
be
of
age
and
may
choose
for
herself
;
and
a
pretty
choice
she
have
make
!
 
<EOS>
what
now
,
"
after
pause
a
moment
,
"
your
poor
sister
be
go
to
her
own
room
,
I
suppose
,
to
moan
by
herself
.
<EOS>
be
there
nothing
one
can
get
to
comfort
her
?
<EOS>
poor
dear
,
it
seem
quite
cruel
to
let
her
be
alone
.
<EOS>
well
,
by
and
by
we
shall
have
a
few
friend
,
and
that
will
amuse
her
a
little
.
<EOS>
what
shall
we
play
at
?
<EOS>
She
hate
whist
I
know
;
but
be
there
no
round
game
she
care
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
madam
,
this
kindness
be
quite
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
Marianne
,
I
dare
say
,
will
not
leave
her
room
again
this
evening
.
<EOS>
I
shall
persuade
her
if
I
can
to
go
early
to
bed
,
for
I
be
sure
she
want
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
I
believe
that
will
be
good
for
her
.
<EOS>
let
her
name
her
own
supper
,
and
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
no
wonder
she
have
be
look
so
bad
and
so
cast
down
this
last
week
or
two
,
<EOS>
for
this
matter
I
suppose
have
be
hang
over
her
head
as
long
as
that
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
letter
that
come
today
finish
it
!
<EOS>
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
if
I
have
have
a
notion
of
it
,
I
would
not
have
joke
her
about
it
for
all
my
money
.
<EOS>
but
then
you
know
,
how
should
I
guess
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
I
make
sure
of
its
be
nothing
but
a
common
love
letter
,
and
you
know
young
people
like
to
be
laugh
at
about
them
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
concerned
Sir
John
and
my
daughter
will
be
when
they
hear
it
!
<EOS>
if
I
have
my
sense
about
me
I
may
have
call
in
Conduit
Street
in
my
way
home
,
and
tell
them
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
see
them
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
unnecessary
I
be
sure
,
for
you
to
caution
Mrs.
Palmer
and
Sir
John
against
ever
name
Mr.
Willoughby
,
or
make
the
slight
allusion
to
what
have
pass
,
before
my
sister
.
<EOS>
Their
own
good
-
nature
must
point
out
to
them
the
real
cruelty
of
appear
to
know
any
thing
about
it
when
she
be
present
;
and
the
less
that
may
ever
be
say
to
myself
on
the
subject
,
the
more
my
feeling
will
be
spare
,
as
you
my
dear
madam
will
easily
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
Lord
!
<EOS>
yes
,
that
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
terrible
for
you
to
hear
it
talk
of
;
and
as
for
your
sister
,
I
be
sure
I
would
not
mention
a
word
about
it
to
her
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
do
not
all
dinner
time
.
<EOS>
no
more
would
Sir
John
,
nor
my
daughter
,
for
they
be
all
very
thoughtful
and
considerate
;
especially
if
I
give
them
a
hint
,
as
I
certainly
will
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
think
the
less
that
be
say
about
such
thing
,
the
well
,
the
sooner
'
tis
blow
over
and
forget
.
<EOS>
and
what
do
talk
ever
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
this
affair
it
can
only
do
harm
;
more
so
perhaps
than
in
many
case
of
a
similar
kind
,
for
it
have
be
attend
by
circumstance
which
,
for
the
sake
of
every
one
concern
in
it
,
make
it
unfit
to
become
the
public
conversation
.
<EOS>
I
must
do
_
this
_
justice
to
Mr.
Willoughby
 
<EOS>
he
have
break
no
positive
engagement
with
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
law
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
do
not
pretend
to
defend
him
.
<EOS>
no
positive
engagement
indeed
!
<EOS>
after
take
her
all
over
Allenham
House
,
and
fix
on
the
very
room
they
be
to
live
in
hereafter
!
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
,
for
her
sister
's
sake
,
could
not
press
the
subject
farther
,
and
she
hope
it
be
not
require
of
her
for
Willoughby
's
;
since
,
though
Marianne
may
lose
much
,
he
could
gain
very
little
by
the
enforcement
of
the
real
truth
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
silence
on
both
side
,
Mrs.
Jennings
,
with
all
her
natural
hilarity
,
burst
forth
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my

tis
a
true

chuckle
over
this
news

will
come
tonight

will
be

little

her

she
may
be

prentice
out
at
a
small
cost

then
what
do
it
signify
?
<EOS>
Delaford
be
a
nice
place
,
I
can
tell
you
;
exactly
what
I
call
a
nice
old
fashioned
place
,
full
of
comfort
and
convenience
;
quite
shut
in
with
great
garden
wall
that
be
cover
with
the
good
fruit
-
tree
in
the
country
;
and
such
a
mulberry
tree
in
one
corner
!
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
Charlotte
and
I
do
stuff
the
only
time
we
be
there
!
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
a
dovecote
,
some
delightful
stew
-
pond
,
and
a
very
pretty
canal
;
and
every
thing
,
in
short
,
that
one
could
wish
for
;
and
,
moreover
,
it
be
close
to
the
church
,
and
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
turnpike
-
road
,
so
'
tis
never
dull
,
for
if
you
only
go
and
sit
up
in
an
old
yew
arbour
behind
the

you
may
see
all
the

tis
a

the
parsonage

house
within
a
stone
's
throw

<EOS>
to
my
fancy
,
a
thousand
time
pretty
than
Barton
Park
,
where
they
be

to
send
three
mile
for
their
meat

have
not

go
away
to

Marianne

as

earnest

gentle

soon
soften
her
to
compliance

Elinor

her
lay
her

in

take
it
to

complaint

how
good
you

I
have
just
leave
Marianne

almost
asleep

nothing
will

much

me
leave

its

,
and
by
his
manner
of
look
round
the
room
for
Marianne
,
Elinor
immediately
fancy
that
he
neither
expect
nor
wish
to
see
her
there
,
and
,
in
short
,
that
he
be
already
aware
of
what
occasion
her
absence
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
be
not
strike
by
the
same
thought
;
for
soon
after
his
entrance
,
she
walk
across
the
room
to
the
tea
-
table
where
Elinor
preside
,
and
whisper
,
"
the
Colonel
look
as
grave
as
ever
you
see
.
<EOS>
He
know
nothing
of
it
;
do
tell
him
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
shortly
afterwards
draw
a
chair
close
to
her
's
,
and
,
with
a
look
which
perfectly
assure
her
of
his
good
information
,
inquire
after
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
Marianne
be
not
well
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
have
be
indispose
all
day
,
and
we
have
persuade
her
to
go
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
then
,
"
he
hesitatingly
reply
,
"
what
I
hear
this
morning
may
be
 
there
may
be
more
truth
in
it
than
I
could
believe
possible
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
that
a
gentleman
,
whom
I
have
reason
to
think
 
in

that
a
man

I

how
shall
I

you

if
you

surely
you

I

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean

answer
Elinor
,
with
force
calmness
,
"
Mr.
Willoughby
's
marriage
with
Miss
Grey

<EOS>
yes
,
we
_
do
<EOS>
_
know
it
all
.
<EOS>
this
seem
to
have
be
a
day
of
general
elucidation
,
for
this
very
morning
first
unfold
it
to
us
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Willoughby
be
unfathomable
!
<EOS>
where
do
you
hear
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
a
stationer
's
shop
in
Pall
Mall
,
where
I
have
business
.
<EOS>
two
lady
be
wait
for
their
carriage
,
and
one
of
them
be
give
the
other
an
account
of
the
intended
match
,
in
a
voice
so
little
attempt
concealment
,
that
it
be
impossible
for
me
not
to
hear
all
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
Willoughby
,
John
Willoughby
,
frequently
repeat
,
first
catch
my
attention
;
and
what
follow
be
a
positive
assertion
that
every
thing
be
now
finally
settle
respect
his
marriage
with
Miss
Grey
 
<EOS>
it
be
no
long
to
be
a
secret
 
it
would
take
place
even
within
a
few
week
,
with
many
particular
of
preparation
and
other
matter
.
<EOS>
one
thing
,
especially
,
I
remember
,
because
it
serve
to
identify
the
man
still
more
:
 
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
be
over
,
they
be
to
go
to
Combe
Magna
,
his
seat
in
Somersetshire
.
<EOS>
My
astonishment
!
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
what
I
feel
.
<EOS>
the
communicative
lady
I
learn
,
on
inquiry
,
 
for
I
stay
in
the
shop
till
they
be
go
,
 
be
a
Mrs.
Ellison
,
and
that
,
as
I
have
be
since
inform
,
be
the
name
of
Miss
Grey
's
guardian
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
.
<EOS>
but
have
you
likewise
hear
that
Miss
Grey
have
fifty
thousand
pound
?
<EOS>
in
that
,
if
in
any
thing
,
we
may
find
an
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
;
but
Willoughby
be
capable
 
<EOS>
at
least
I
think
 
"
He
stop
a
moment
;
then
add
in
a
voice
which
seem
to
distrust
itself
,
"
and
your
sister
,
 
how
do
she
,
 
"
  
"
Her
suffering
have
be
very
severe
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
hope
that
they
may
be
proportionately
short
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
,
it
be
a
most
cruel
affliction
.
<EOS>
till
yesterday
,
I
believe
,
she
never
doubt
his
regard
;
and
even
now
,
perhaps
 
<EOS>
but
_
<EOS>
I
_
be
almost
convinced
that
he
never
be
really
attach
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
very
deceitful
!
<EOS>
and
,
in
some
point
,
there
seem
a
hardness
of
heart
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
Colonel
Brandon
,
"
there
be
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
but
your
sister
do
not
 
I
think
you
say
so
 
she
do
not
consider
quite
as
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
her
disposition
,
and
may
believe
how
eagerly
she
would
still
justify
him
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
make
no
answer
;
and
soon
afterwards
,
by
the
removal
of
the
tea
-
thing
,
and
the
arrangement
of
the
card
party
,
the
subject
be
necessarily
drop
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
,
who
have
watch
them
with
pleasure
while
they
be
talk
,
and
who
expect
to
see
the
effect
of
Miss
Dashwood
's
communication
,
in
such
an
instantaneous
gaiety
on
Colonel
Brandon
's
side
,
as
may
have
become
a
man
in
the
bloom
of
youth
,
of
hope
and
happiness
,
see
him
,
with
amazement
,
remain
the
whole
evening
more
serious
and
thoughtful
than
usual
.
    
<EOS>
from
a
night
of
more
sleep
than
she
have
expect
,
Marianne
awake
the
next
morning
to
the
same
consciousness
of
misery
in
which
she
have
close
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
encourage
her
as
much
as
possible
to
talk
of
what
she
feel
;
and
before
breakfast
be
ready
,
they
have
go
through
the
subject
again
and
again
;
and
with
the
same
steady
conviction
and
affectionate
counsel
on
Elinor
's
side
,
the
same
impetuous
feeling
and
vary
opinion
on
Marianne
's
,
as
before
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
could
believe
Willoughby
to
be
as
unfortunate
and
as
innocent
as
herself
,
and
at
other
,
lose
every
consolation
in
the
impossibility
of
acquit
him
.
<EOS>
at
one
moment
she
be
absolutely
indifferent
to
the
observation
of
all
the
world
,
at
another
she
would
seclude
herself
from
it
for
ever
,
and
at
a
third
could
resist
it
with
energy
.
<EOS>
in
one
thing
,
however
,
she
be
uniform
,
when
it
come
to
the
point
,
in
avoid
,
where
it
be
possible
,
the
presence
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
and
in
a
determined
silence
when
oblige
to
endure
it
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
harden
against
the
belief
of
Mrs.
Jennings
's
enter
into
her
sorrow
with
any
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
no
,
it
can
not
be
,
"
she
cry
;
"
she
can
not
feel
.
<EOS>
Her
kindness
be
not
sympathy
;
her
good
-
nature
be
not
tenderness
.
<EOS>
all
that
she
want
be
gossip
,
and
she
only
like
me
now
because
I
supply
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
have
not
need
this
to
be
assure
of
the
injustice
to
which
her
sister
be
often
lead
in
her
opinion
of
other
,
by
the
irritable
refinement
of
her
own
mind
,
and
the
too
great
importance
place
by
her
on
the
delicacy
of
a
strong
sensibility
,
and
the
grace
of
a
polished
manner
.
<EOS>
like
half
the
rest
of
the
world
,
if
more
than
half
there
be
that
be
clever
and
good
,
Marianne
,
with
excellent
ability
and
an
excellent
disposition
,
be
neither
reasonable
nor
candid
.
<EOS>
She
expect
from
other
people
the
same
opinion
and
feeling
as
her
own
,
and
she
judge
of
their
motive
by
the
immediate
effect
of
their
action
on
herself
.
<EOS>
thus
a
circumstance
occur
,
while
the
sister
be
together
in
their
own
room
after
breakfast
,
which
sink
the
heart
of
Mrs.
Jennings
still
low
in
her
estimation
;
because
,
through
her
own
weakness
,
it
chance
to
prove
a
source
of
fresh
pain
to
herself
,
though
Mrs.
Jennings
be
govern
in
it
by
an
impulse
of
the
utmost
good
-
will
.
  
<EOS>
with
a
letter
in
her
outstretched
hand
,
and
countenance
gaily
smile
,
from
the
persuasion
of
bring
comfort
,
she
enter
their
room
,
say
    
"
now
,
my
dear
,
I
bring
you
something
that
I
be
sure
will
do
you
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
Marianne
hear
enough
.
<EOS>
in
one
moment
her
imagination
place
before
her
a
letter
from
Willoughby
,
full
of
tenderness
and
contrition
,
explanatory
of
all
that
have
pass
,
satisfactory
,
convincing
;
and
instantly
follow
by
Willoughby
himself
,
rush
eagerly
into
the
room
to
enforce
,
at
her
foot
,
by
the
eloquence
of
his
eye
,
the
assurance
of
his
letter
.
<EOS>
the
work
of
one
moment
be
destroy
by
the
next
.
<EOS>
the
hand
writing
of
her
mother
,
never
till
then
unwelcome
,
be
before
her
;
and
,
in
the
acuteness
of
the
disappointment
which
follow
such
an
ecstasy
of
more
than
hope
,
she
feel
as
if
,
till
that
instant
,
she
have
never
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
the
cruelty
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
no
language
,
within
her
reach
in
her
moment
of
happy
eloquence
,
could
have
express
;
and
now
she
could
reproach
her
only
by
the
tear
which
stream
from
her
eye
with
passionate
violence
;
 
a
reproach
,
however
,
so
entirely
lose
on
its
object
,
that
after
many
expression
of
pity
,
she
withdraw
,
still
refer
her
to
the
letter
of
comfort
.
<EOS>
but
the
letter
,
when
she
be
calm
enough
to
read
it
,
bring
little
comfort
.
<EOS>
Willoughby
fill
every
page
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
still
confident
of
their
engagement
,
and
rely
as
warmly
as
ever
on
his
constancy
,
have
only
be
rouse
by
Elinor
's
application
,
to
entreat
from
Marianne
great
openness
towards
them
both
;
and
this
,
with
such
tenderness
towards
her
,
such
affection
for
Willoughby
,
and
such
a
conviction
of
their
future
happiness
in
each
other
,
that
she
weep
with
agony
through
the
whole
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
all
her
impatience
to
be
at
home
again
now
return
;
her
mother
be
dearer
to
her
than
ever
;
dearer
through
the
very
excess
of
her
mistaken
confidence
in
Willoughby
,
and
she
be
wildly
urgent
to
be
go
.
<EOS>
Elinor
,
unable
herself
to
determine
whether
it
be
well
for
Marianne
to
be
in
London
or
at
Barton
,
offer
no
counsel
of
her
own
except
of
patience
till
their
mother
's
wish
could
be
know
;
and
at
length
she
obtain
her
sister
's
consent
to
wait
for
that
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
leave
them
earlier
than
usual
;
for
she
could
not
be
easy
till
the
Middletons
and
Palmers
be
able
to
grieve
as
much
as
herself
;
and
positively
refuse
Elinor
's
offer
attendance
,
go
out
alone
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Elinor
,
with
a
very
heavy
heart
,
aware
of
the
pain
she
be
go
to
communicate
,
and
perceiving
,
by
Marianne
's
letter
<EOS>
,
how
ill
she
have
succeed
in
lay
any
foundation
for
it
,
then
sit
down
to
write
her
mother
an
account
of
what
have
pass
,
and
entreat
her
direction
for
the
future
;
while
Marianne
,
who
come
into
the
drawing
-
room
on
Mrs.
Jennings
's
go
away
,
remain
fix
at
the
table
where
Elinor
write
,
watch
the
advancement
of
her
pen
,
grieve
over
her
for
the
hardship
of
such
a
task
,
and
grieve
still
more
fondly
over
its
effect
on
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
they
have
continue
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
when
Marianne
,
whose
nerve
could
not
then
bear
any
sudden
noise
,
be
startle
by
a
rap
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
can
this
be
?
<EOS>
"
cry
Elinor
.
"
<EOS>
so
early
too
!
<EOS>
I
think
we
_
have

be
safe

"
  
<EOS>
Marianne
move
to
the
window
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
Colonel
Brandon

"
<EOS>
say
she
,
with
vexation

<EOS>
"
We
be
never
safe
from

him

"
He
will
not
come
in

as
Mrs.
Jennings
be
from
home

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
trust
to
_
that
_

"
retreat
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
man
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
own
time
have
no
conscience
in
his
intrusion
on
that
of
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
event
prove
her
conjecture
right
,
though
it
be
found
on
injustice
and
error
;
for
Colonel
Brandon
_
do
_
come
in
;
and
Elinor
,
who
be
convince
that
solicitude
for
Marianne
bring
him
thither
,
and
who
see
_
that
_
solicitude
in
his
disturbed
and
melancholy
look
,
and
in
his
anxious
though
brief
inquiry
after
her
,
could
not
forgive
her
sister
for
esteem
him
so
lightly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
meet
Mrs.
Jennings
in
Bond
Street

say
he
,
after
the
first
salutation
,
"
and
she
encourage
me
to
come
on
;
and
<EOS>
I
be
the
more
easily
encourage
,
because
I
think
it
probable
that
I
may
find
you
alone
,
which
I
be
very
desirous
of
do

My

it

to
be
a
means

give
comfort

no

I
must
not
say
comfort
 
not
present
comfort

conviction

last
conviction

your
sister

mind

<EOS>
My
regard

You

He
stopt
a
moment
for
recollection

and
then
,
with
another
sigh
,
go
on

<EOS>
"
You
have
probably
entirely
forget
a
conversation
 
<EOS>
(
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
it
could
make
any
impression
on
you
)
 
<EOS>
a
conversation
between
us
one
evening
at
Barton
Park
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
evening
of
a
dance
 
in
which
I
allude
to
a
lady
I
have
once
know
,
as
resemble
,
in
some
measure
,
your
sister
Marianne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
answer
Elinor
,
"
I
have
_
not
_
forget
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
look
pleased
by
this
remembrance
,
and
add
    
"
if
I
be
not
deceive
by
the
uncertainty
,
the
partiality
of
tender
recollection
,
there
be
a
very
strong
resemblance
between
them
,
as
well
in
mind
as
person
.
<EOS>
the
same
warmth
of
heart
,
the
same
eagerness
of
fancy
and
spirit
.
<EOS>
this
lady
be
one
of
my
near
relation
,
an
orphan
from
her
infancy
,
and
under
the
guardianship
of
my
father
.
<EOS>
Our
age
be
nearly
the
same
,
and
from
our
early
year
we
be
playfellow
and
friend
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
remember
the
time
when
I
do
not
love
Eliza
;
and
my
affection
for
her
,
as
we
grow
up
,
be
such
,
as
perhaps
,
judge
from
my
present
forlorn
and
cheerless
gravity
,
you
may
think
me
incapable
of
have
ever
feel
.
<EOS>
Her
be
,
for
me
,
be
,
I
believe
,
fervent
as
the
attachment
of
your
sister
to
Mr.
Willoughby
<EOS>
and
it
be
,
though
from
a
different
cause
,
no
less
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
at
seventeen
she
be
lose
to
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
She
be
marry
 
marry
against
her
inclination
to
my
brother
.
<EOS>
Her
fortune
be
large
,
and
our
family
estate
much
encumber
.
<EOS>
and
this
,
I
fear
,
be
all
that
can
be
say
for
the
conduct
of
one
,
who
be
at
once
her
uncle
and
guardian
.
<EOS>
My
brother
do
not
deserve
her
;
he
do
not
even
love
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
hope
that
her
regard
for
me
would
support
her
under
any
difficulty
,
and
for
some
time
it
do
;
but
at
last
the
misery
of
her
situation
,
for
she
experience
great
unkindness
,
overcome
all
her
resolution
,
and
though
she
have
promise
me
that
nothing
 
<EOS>
but
how
blindly
I
relate
!
<EOS>
I
have
never
tell
you
how
this
be
bring
on
.
<EOS>
We
be
within
a
few
hour
of
elope
together
for
Scotland
.
<EOS>
the
treachery
,
or
the
folly
,
of
my
cousin
's
maid
betray
us
.
<EOS>
I
be
banish
to
the
house
of
a
relation
far
distant
,
and
she
be
allow
no
liberty
,
no
society
,
no
amusement
,
till
my
father
's
point
be
gain
.
<EOS>
I
have
depend
on
her
fortitude
too
far
,
and
the
blow
be
a
severe
one
,
but
have
her
marriage
be
happy
,
so
young
as
I
then
be
,
a
few
month
must
have
reconcile
me
to
it
,
or
at
least
I
should
not
have
now
to
lament
it
.
<EOS>
this
however
be
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
My
brother
have
no
regard
for
her
;
his
pleasure
be
not
what
they
ought
to
have
be
,
and
from
the
first
he
treat
her
unkindly
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
this
,
upon
a
mind
so
young
,
so
lively
,
so
inexperienced
as
Mrs.
Brandon
's
,
be
but
too
natural
.
<EOS>
She
resign
herself
at
first
to
all
the
misery
of
her
situation
;
and
happy
have
it
be
if
she
have
not
live
to
overcome
those
regret
which
the
remembrance
of
me
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
can
we
wonder
that
,
with
such
a
husband
to
provoke
inconstancy
,
and
without
a
friend
to
advise
or
restrain
her
(
for
my
father
live
only
a
few
month
after
their
marriage
,
and
I
be
with
my
regiment
in
the
East
Indies
)
<EOS>
she
should
fall
?
<EOS>
have
I
remain
in
England
,
perhaps
 
<EOS>
but
I
mean
to
promote
the
happiness
of
both
by
remove
from
her
for
year
,
and
for
that
purpose
have
procure
my
exchange
.
<EOS>
the
shock
which
her
marriage
have
give
me
,
"
he
continue
,
in
a
voice
of
great
agitation
,
"
be
of
trifle
weight
 
be
nothing
to
what
I
feel
when
I
hear
,
about
two
year
afterwards
,
of
her
divorce
.
<EOS>
It
be
_
that
_
which
throw
this
gloom
,
 
even
now
the
recollection
of
what
I
suffer
 
<EOS>
"
  
He
could
say
no
more
,
and
rise
hastily
walk
for
a
few
minute
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
Elinor
,
affect
by
his
relation
,
and
still
more
by
his
distress
,
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
He
see
her
concern
,
and
come
to
her
,
take
her
hand
,
press
it
,
and
kiss
it
with
grateful
respect
.
<EOS>
a
few
minute
more
of
silent
exertion
enable
him
to
proceed
with
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
nearly
three
year
after
this
unhappy
period
before
I
return
to
England
.
<EOS>
My
first
care
,
when
I
_
do
_
arrive
,
be
of
course
to
seek
for
her
;
but
the
search
be
as
fruitless
as
it
be
melancholy
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
trace
her
beyond
her
first
seducer
,
and
there
be
every
reason
to
fear
that
she
have
remove
from
him
only
to
sink
deeper
in
a
life
of
sin
.
<EOS>
Her
legal
allowance
be
not
adequate
to
her
fortune
,
nor
sufficient
for
her
comfortable
maintenance
,
and
I
learn
from
my
brother
that
the
power
of
receive
it
have
be
make
over
some
month
before
to
another
person
.
<EOS>
He
imagine
,
and
calmly
could
he
imagine
it
,
that
her
extravagance
,
and
consequent
distress
,
have
oblige
her
to
dispose
of
it
for
some
immediate
relief
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
and
after
I
have
be
six
month
in
England
,
I
_
do
_
find
her

<EOS>
regard
for
a
former
servant
of
my
own
,
who
have
since
fall
into
misfortune
,
carry
me
to
visit
him
in
a
spunging

house
,
where
he
be
confine
for

;
and
there
,
in
the
same
house
,
under
a
similar
confinement

be
my
unfortunate
sister

<EOS>
so
alter
 
so
fade
 
<EOS>
wear
down
by
acute
suffering
of
every

<EOS>
hardly

I

the
melancholy

sickly
figure

I

I
have
no
right
to
wound
your
feeling
by
attempt

describe
it

I
have
pain
you
too
much
already

nothing

give

death

that

<EOS>
I
see
her
place
in
comfortable
lodging

under
proper
attendant
;
I
visit
her
every
day
during
the
rest

Elinor
speak
her
feeling
in
an
exclamation
of
tender
concern

at
the
fate
of
his
unfortunate
friend

<EOS>
"
Your

I

can
not

by
the
resemblance
I
have
fancy

poor
disgraced
relation

<EOS>
Their
fate

can

have
the
natural
sweet
disposition

to
what
do
all
this
lead

<EOS>
I
seem
to
have

distress
you

<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
Miss
Dashwood
 
<EOS>
a
subject
such
as
this
 
untouched
for
fourteen
year
 
<EOS>
it
be
dangerous
to
handle
it
at
all
!
<EOS>
I
_
will
_
be
more
collected
 
more
concise
.
<EOS>
She
leave
to
my
care
her
only
child
,
a
little
girl
,
the
offspring
of
her
first
guilty
connection
,
who
be
then
about
three
year
old
.
<EOS>
She
love
the
child
,
and
have
always
keep
it
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
value
,
a
precious
trust
to
me
;
and
gladly
would
I
have
discharge
it
in
the
strict
sense
,
by
watch
over
her
education
myself
,
have
the
nature
of
our
situation
allow
it
;
but
I
have
no
family
,
no
home
;
and
my
little
Eliza
be
therefore
place
at
school
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
there
whenever
I
could
,
and
after
the
death
of
my
brother
,
(
which
happen
about
five
year
ago
,
and
which
leave
to
me
the
possession
of
the
family
property
,
)
she
visit
me
at
Delaford
.
<EOS>
I
call
her
a
distant
relation
;
but
I
be
well
aware
that
I
have
in
general
be
suspect
of
a
much
near
connection
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
three
year
ago
(
she
have
just
reach
her
fourteenth
year
,
)
that
I
remove
her
from
school
,
to
place
her
under
the
care
of
a
very
respectable
woman
,
reside
in
Dorsetshire
,
who
have
the
charge
of
four
or
five
other
girl
of
about
the
same
time
of
life
;
and
for
two
year
I
have
every
reason
to
be
pleased
with
her
situation
.
<EOS>
but
last
February
,
almost
a
twelvemonth
back
,
she
suddenly
disappear
.
<EOS>
I
have
allow
her
,
(
imprudently
,
as
it
have
since
turn
out
,
)
at
her
earnest
desire
,
to
go
to
Bath
with
one
of
her
young
friend
,
who
be
attend
her
father
there
for
his
health
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
to
be
a
very
good
sort
of
man
,
and
I
think
well
of
his
daughter
 
better
than
she
deserve
,
for
,
with
a
most
obstinate
and
ill
-
judge
secrecy
,
she
would
tell
nothing
,
would
give
no
clue
,
though
she
certainly
know
all
.
<EOS>
He
,
her
father
,
a
well
-
meaning
,
but
not
a
quick
-
sighted
man
,
could
really
,
I
believe
,
give
no
information
;
for
he
have
be
generally
confine
to
the
house
,
while
the
girl
be
range
over
the
town
and
make
what
acquaintance
they
choose
;
and
he
try
to
convince
me
,
as
thoroughly
as
he
be
convince
himself
,
of
his
daughter
's
be
entirely
unconcerned
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
could
learn
nothing
but
that
she
be
go
;
all
the
rest
,
for
eight
long
month
,
be
leave
to
conjecture
.
<EOS>
what
I
think
,
what
I
fear
,
may
be
imagine
;
and
what
I
suffer
too
.

Elinor

could
it

"
the
first
news
that
reach
me
of
her

come
in
a
letter
from
herself
,
last
October
.
<EOS>
It
be
forward
to
me
from
Delaford
,
and
I
receive
it
on
the
very
morning
of
our
intend
party
to
Whitwell
;
and
this
be
the
reason
of
my
leave
Barton
<EOS>
so
suddenly
,
which
I
be
sure
must
at
the
time
have
appear
strange
to
every
body
,
and
which
I
believe
give
offence
to
some
.
<EOS>
little
do
Mr.
Willoughby
imagine
,
I
suppose
,
when
his
look
censure
me
for
incivility
in
break
up
the
party
,
that
I
be
call
away
to
the
relief
of
one
whom
he
have
make
poor
and
miserable
;
but
_
have
_
he
know
it
<EOS>
,
what
would
it
have
avail
?
<EOS>
Would
he
have
be
less
gay
or
less
happy
in
the
smile
of
your
sister
?
<EOS>
no
,
he
have
already
do
that
,
which
no
man
who
_
can
_
feel
for
another
would
do
.
<EOS>
He
have
leave
the
girl
whose
youth
and
innocence
he
have
seduce
,
in
a
situation
of
the
utmost
distress
,
with
no
creditable
home
,
no
help
,
no
friend
,
ignorant
of
his
address
!
<EOS>
He
have
leave
her
,
promise
to
return
;
he
neither
return
,
nor
write
,
nor
relieve
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
beyond
every
thing
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Elinor
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
character
be
now
before
you
;
expensive
,
dissipate
,
and
bad
than
both
.
<EOS>
know
all
this
,
as
I
have
now
know
it
many
week
,
guess
what
I
must
have
feel
on
see
your
sister
as
fond
of
him
as
ever
,
and
on
be
assure
that
she
be
to
marry
him

guess
what
I
must
have
feel
for
all
your
sake

<EOS>
when
I
come
to
you
last
week
and
find
you
alone

I
come
determined
to
know
the
truth

though
irresolute
what
to
do
when
it

be
_
know

My
behaviour
must
have
seem
strange
to
you
then

but
now
you
will
comprehend
it
.
<EOS>
to
suffer
you
all
to
be
so
deceive
;
to
see
your
sister
 
but
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
hope
of
interfere
with
success
;
and
sometimes
I
think
your
sister
's
influence
may
yet
reclaim
him
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
after
such
dishonorable
usage
,
who
can
tell
what
be
his
design
on
her
.
<EOS>
whatever
they
may
have
be
,
however
,
she
may
now
,
and
hereafter
doubtless
_
will
_
,
turn
with
gratitude
towards
her
own
condition
,
when
she
compare
it
with
that
of
my
poor
Eliza
,
when
she
consider
the
wretched
and
hopeless
situation
of
this
poor
girl
,
and
picture
her
to
herself
,
with
an
affection
for
him
so
strong
,
still
as
strong
as
her
own
,
and
with
a
mind
torment
by
self
-
reproach
,
which
must
attend
her
through
life

<EOS>
surely
this
comparison
must
have
its
use
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
will
feel
her
own
suffering
to
be
nothing

They
proceed
from
no
misconduct

bring
no

the
contrary

still
more
her
friend

them

concern
for
her
unhappiness

and
respect
for
her
fortitude
under
it

must
strengthen
every
attachment

<EOS>
use
your
own
discretion

however

in
communicate
to

what
I
have
tell
you

You

not
seriously
,
and
from
my
heart
believe
it
may
be
of
service
,
may
lessen
her
regret
,
I
would
not
have
suffer
myself
to
trouble
you
with
this
account
of
my
family
affliction
,
with
a
recital
which
may
seem
to
have
be
intend
to
raise
myself
at
the
expense
of
other

"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
's
thank
follow
this
speech
with
grateful
earnestness
;
attend
too
with
the
assurance
of
her
expect
material
advantage
to
Marianne
,
from
the
communication
of
what
have
pass
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
more
pain
,
"
say
she
,
"
by
her
endeavor
to
acquit
him
than
by
all
the
rest
;
for
it
irritate
her
mind
more
than
the
most
perfect
conviction
of
his
unworthiness
can
do
.
<EOS>
now
,
though
at
first
she
will
suffer
much
,
I
be
sure
she
will
soon
become
easy
.
<EOS>
have
you
,
"
she
continue
,
after
a
short
silence
,
"
ever
see
Mr.
Willoughby
since
you
leave
him
at
Barton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
reply
gravely
,
"
once
I
have
.
<EOS>
one
meeting
be
unavoidable
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
,
startle
by
his
manner
,
look
at
him
anxiously
,
say
    
"
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
have
you
meet
him
to
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
could
meet
him
no
other
way
.
<EOS>
Eliza
have
confess
to
me
,
though
most
reluctantly
,
the
name
of
her
lover
;
and
when
he
return
to
town
,
which
be
within
a
fortnight
after
myself
,
we
meet
by
appointment
,
he
to
defend
,
I
to
punish
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
We
return
unwounded
,
and
the
meeting
,
therefore
,
never
get
abroad
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
sigh
over
the
fancy
necessity
of
this
;
but
to
a
man
and
a
soldier
she
presume
not
to
censure
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
such
,
"
say
Colonel
Brandon
,
after
a
pause
,
"
have
be
the
unhappy
resemblance
between
the
fate
of
mother
and
daughter
!
<EOS>
and
so
imperfectly
have
I
discharge
my
trust
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
she
still
in
town
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
as
soon
as
she
recover
from
her
lying
-
in
,
for
I
find
her
near
her
delivery
,
I
remove
her
and
her
child
into
the
country
,
and
there
she
remain
.
"
  
<EOS>
recollecting
,
soon
afterwards
,
that
he
be
probably
divide
Elinor
from
her
sister
,
he
put
an
end
to
his
visit
,
receive
from
her
again
the
same
grateful
acknowledgment
,
and
leave
her
full
of
compassion
and
esteem
for
him
.
    
<EOS>
when
the
particular
of
this
conversation
be
repeat
by
Miss
Dashwood
to
her
sister
,
as
they
very
soon
be
,
the
effect
on
her
be
not
entirely
such
as
the
former
have
hope
to
see
.
<EOS>
not
that
Marianne
appear
to
distrust
the
truth
of
any
part
of
it
,
for
she
listen
to
it
all
with
the
most
steady
and
submissive
attention
,
make
neither
objection
nor
remark
,
attempt
no
vindication
of
Willoughby
,
and
seem
to
show
by
her
tear
that
she
feel
it
to
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
but
though
this
behaviour
assure
Elinor
that
the
conviction
of
this
guilt
<EOS>
_
be
_
carry
home
to
her
mind
,
though
she
see
with
satisfaction
the
effect
of
it
,
in
her
no
longer
avoid
Colonel
Brandon
when
he
call
,
in
her
speak
to
him
,
even
voluntarily
speak
,
with
a
kind
of
compassionate
respect
,
and
though
she
see
her
spirit
less
violently
irritated
than
before
,
she
do
not
see
her
less
wretched
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
do
become
settle
,
but
it
be
settle
in
a
gloomy
dejection
.
<EOS>
She
feel
the
loss
of
Willoughby
's
character
yet
more
heavily
than
she
have
feel
the
loss
of
his
heart
;
his
seduction
and
desertion
of
Miss
Williams
,
the
misery
of
that
poor
girl
,
and
the
doubt
of
what
his
design
may
_
<EOS>
once
_
have
be
on
herself
,
prey
altogether
so
much
on
her
spirit
,
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak
of
what
she
feel
even
to
Elinor
;
and
,
brood
over
her
sorrow
in
silence
,
give
more
pain
to
her
sister
than
could
have
be
communicate
by
the
most
open
and
most
frequent
confession
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
to
give
the
feeling
or
the
language
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
on
receive
and
answer
Elinor
's
letter
would
be
only
to
give
a
repetition
of
what
her
daughter
have
already
feel
and
say
;
of
a
disappointment
hardly
less
painful
than
Marianne
's
,
and
an
indignation
even
great
than
Elinor
's
.
<EOS>
long
letter
from
her
,
quickly
succeed
each
other
,
arrive
to
tell
all
that
she
suffer
and
think
;
to
express
her
anxious
solicitude
for
Marianne
,
and
entreat
she
would
bear
up
with
fortitude
under
this
misfortune
.
<EOS>
bad
indeed
must
the
nature
of
Marianne
's
affliction
be
,
when
her
mother
could
talk
of
fortitude
!
<EOS>
mortifying
and
humiliating
must
be
the
origin
of
those
regret
,
which
_
she
_
could
wish
her
not
to
indulge
!
  
<EOS>
against
the
interest
of
her
own
individual
comfort
,
Mrs.
Dashwood
have
determine
that
it
would
be
well
for
Marianne
to
be
any
where
,
at
that
time
,
than
at
Barton
,
where
every
thing
within
her
view
would
be
bring
back
the
past
in
the
strong
and
most
afflicting
manner
,
by
constantly
place
Willoughby
before
her
,
such
as
she
have
always
see
him
there
.
<EOS>
She
recommend
it
to
her
daughter
,
therefore
,
by
all
mean
not
to
shorten
their
visit
to
Mrs.
Jennings
;
the
length
of
which
,
though
never
exactly
fix
,
have
be
expect
by
all
to
comprise
at
least
five
or
six
week
.
<EOS>
a
variety
of
occupation
,
of
object
,
and
of
company
,
which
could
not
be
procure
at
Barton
,
would
be
inevitable
there
,
and
may
yet
,
she
hope
,
cheat
Marianne
,
at
time
,
into
some
interest
beyond
herself
,
and
even
into
some
amusement
,
much
as
the
idea
of
both
may
now
be
spurn
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
from
all
danger
of
see
Willoughby
again
,
her
mother
consider
her
to
be
at
least
equally
safe
in
town
as
in
the
country
,
since
his
acquaintance
must
now
be
drop
by
all
who
call
themselves
her
friend
.
<EOS>
design
could
never
bring
them
in
each
other
's
way
:
negligence
could
never
leave
them
expose
to
a
surprise
;
and
chance
have
less
in
its
favour
in
the
crowd
of
London
than
even
in
the
retirement
of
Barton
,
where
it
may
force
him
before
her
while
pay
that
visit
at
Allenham
on
his
marriage
,
which
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
from
foresee
at
first
as
a
probable
event
,
have
bring
herself
to
expect
as
a
certain
one
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
yet
another
reason
for
wish
her
child
to
remain
where
they
be
;
a
letter
from
her
son
-
in
-
law
have
tell
her
that
he
and
his
wife
be
to
be
in
town
before
the
middle
of
February
,
and
she
judge
it
right
that
they
should
sometimes
see
their
brother
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
have
promise
to
be
guide
by
her
mother
's
opinion
,
and
she
submit
to
it
therefore
without
opposition
,
though
it
prove
perfectly
different
from
what
she
wish
and
expect
,
though
she
feel
it
to
be
entirely
wrong
,
form
on
mistaken
ground
,
and
that
by
require
her
long
continuance
in
London
it
deprive
her
of
the
only
possible
alleviation
of
her
wretchedness
,
the
personal
sympathy
of
her
mother
,
and
doom
her
to
such
society
and
such
scene
as
must
prevent
her
ever
know
a
moment
's
rest
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
matter
of
great
consolation
to
her
,
that
what
bring
evil
to
herself
would
bring
good
to
her
sister
;
and
Elinor
,
on
the
other
hand
,
suspect
that
it
would
not
be
in
her
power
to
avoid
Edward
entirely
,
comfort
herself
by
think
,
that
though
their
long
stay
would
therefore
militate
against
her
own
happiness
,
it
would
be
well
for
Marianne
than
an
immediate
return
into
Devonshire
.
  
<EOS>
Her
carefulness
in
guard
her
sister
from
ever
hear
Willoughby
's
name
mention
,
be
not
throw
away
.
<EOS>
Marianne
,
though
without
know
it
herself
,
reap
all
its
advantage
;
for
neither
Mrs.
Jennings
,
nor
Sir
John
,
nor
even
Mrs.
Palmer
herself
,
ever
speak
of
him
before
her
.
<EOS>
Elinor
wish
that
the
same
forbearance
could
have
extend
towards
herself
,
but
that
be
impossible
,
and
she
be
oblige
to
listen
day
after
day
to
the
indignation
of
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
John

Mrs.

way

equally
angry

<EOS>

She
be
determined
to
drop
his
acquaintance
immediately

and
she
be
very
thankful
that

him
at
all

<EOS>
She
wish
with
all
her
heart
Combe
Magna

not
so
near
Cleveland
;
but
it
do
not
signify
,
for
it
be
a
great
deal
too
far
off
to
visit
;
she
hate
him
so
much
that
she
be
resolve
never

mention
his

again

and
she
should
tell
everybody
she

<EOS>
the
rest
of
Mrs.

sympathy
be
show
in
procure
all
the
particular
in
her
power
of
the
approach
marriage
,
and
communicate
them
to
Elinor

<EOS>
She
could
soon
tell
at
what
coachmaker
be
the
new
carriage
be
build
,
by
what
painter
Mr.
Willoughby
's
portrait
be
draw
,
and
at
what
warehouse
Miss
Grey
's
clothe
may
be
see
.
  
<EOS>
the
calm
and
polite
unconcern
of
Lady
Middleton
on
the
occasion
be
a
happy
relief
to
Elinor
's
spirit
,
oppress
as
they
often
be
by
the
clamorous
kindness
of
the
other

<EOS>
It
be
a
great
comfort
to
her
to
be
sure
of
excite
no
interest
in
_
one
_
person
at
least
among
their
circle
of
friend
:
a
great
comfort
to
know
that
there
be
_
one
<EOS>
_
who
would
meet
her
without
feel
any
curiosity
after
particular
,
or
any
anxiety
for
her
sister
's
health
.
  
<EOS>
every
qualification
be
raise
at
time
,
by
the
circumstance
of
the
moment
,
to
more
than
its
real
value

and
she
be
sometimes
worry
down
by
officious
condolence
to
rate
good

breeding
as
more

<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
express
her
sense
of
the
affair
about
once
every

,
or
twice
,
if
the
subject
occur
very
often
,
by
say
,
"
It
be
very
shocking
,
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
and
by
the
mean
of
this
continual
though
gentle
vent
,
be
able
not
only
to
see
the
Miss
Dashwoods
from
the
first
without
the
small
emotion
,
but
very
soon
to
see
them
without
recollect
a
word
of
the
matter
;
and
have
thus
support
the
dignity
of
her
own
sex
,
and
speak
her
decide
censure
of
what
be
wrong
in
the
other
,
she
think
herself
at
liberty
to
attend
to
the
interest
of
her
own
assembly
,
and
therefore
determine
(
though
rather
against
the
opinion
of
Sir
John
)
that
as
Mrs.
Willoughby
would
at
once
be
a
woman
of
elegance
and
fortune
,
to
leave
her
card
with
her
as
soon
as
she
marry

<EOS>
Colonel
Brandon
's
delicate
,
unobtrusive
enquiry
be
never
unwelcome
to
Miss
Dashwood
.
<EOS>
He
have
abundantly
earn
the
privilege
of
intimate
discussion
of
her
sister
's
disappointment
,
by
the
friendly
zeal
with
which
he
have
endeavour
to
soften
it
,
and
they
always
converse
with
confidence
.
<EOS>
His
chief
reward
for
the
painful
exertion
of
disclose
past
sorrow
and
present
humiliation
,
be
give
in
the
pity
eye
with
which
Marianne
sometimes
observe
him
,
and
the
gentleness
of
her
voice
whenever
(
though
it
do
not
often
happen
)
<EOS>
she
be
oblige
,
or
could
oblige
herself
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
these
_
assure
him
that
his
exertion
have
produce
an
increase
of
good
-
will
towards
himself
,
and
_
these
_
give
Elinor
hope
of
its
be
farther
augment
hereafter
;
but
Mrs.
Jennings
,
who
know
nothing
of
all
this
,
who
know
only
that
the
Colonel
continue
as
grave
as
ever
,
and
that
she
could
neither
prevail
on
him
to
make
the
offer
himself
,
nor
commission
her
to
make
it
for
him
,
begin
,
at
the
end
of
two
day
,
to
think
that
,
instead
of
Mid
-
summer
,
they
would
not
be
marry
till
Michaelmas
,
and
by
the
end
of
a
week
that
it
would
not
be
a
match
at
all
.
<EOS>
the
good
understanding
between
the
Colonel
and
Miss
Dashwood
seem
rather
to
declare
that
the
honour
of
the
mulberry
-
tree
,
the
canal
,
and
the
yew
arbour
,
would
all
be
make
over
to
_
her
_
;
and
Mrs.
Jennings
have
,
for
some
time
cease
to
think
at
all
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
February
,
within
a
fortnight
from
the
receipt
of
Willoughby
's
letter
,
Elinor
have
the
painful
office
of
inform
her
sister
that
he
be
married
.
<EOS>
She
have
take
care
to
have
the
intelligence
convey
to
herself
,
as
soon
as
it
be
know
that
the
ceremony
be
over
,
as
she
be
desirous
that
Marianne
should
not
receive
the
first
notice
of
it
from
the
public
paper
,
which
she
see
her
eagerly
examine
every
morning
.
  
<EOS>
She
receive
the
news
with
resolute
composure
;
make
no
observation
on
it
,
and
at
first
shed
no
tear
;
but
after
a
short
time
they
would
burst
out
,
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
,
she
be
in
a
state
hardly
less
pitiable
than
when
she
first
learn
to
expect
the
event
.
  
<EOS>
the
Willoughbys
leave
town
as
soon
as
they
be
married
;
and
Elinor
now
hope
,
as
there
could
be
no
danger
of
her
see
either
of
them
,
to
prevail
on
her
sister
,
who
have
never
yet

the
house
since
the
blow
first
fall
,
to
go
out
again
by
degree
as
she
have
do
before
.
  
<EOS>
about
this
time
the
two
Miss
Steeles
,
lately
arrive
at
their
cousin
's
house
in
Bartlett
's
Buildings
,
Holborn
,
present
themselves
again
before
their
more
grand
relation
in
Conduit
and
Berkeley
Streets
;
and
be
welcome
by
them
all
with
great
cordiality
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
only
be
sorry
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
Their
presence
always
give
her
pain
,
and
she
hardly
know
how
to
make
a
very
gracious
return
to
the
overpower
delight
of
Lucy
in
find
her
_
still
_
in
town
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
be
quite
disappointed
if
I
have
not
find
you
here
_
still
_
,
"
say
she
repeatedly
,
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
always
think
I
_
<EOS>
should
_
<EOS>
I
be
almost
sure
you
would
not
leave
London
yet
awhile
;
though
you
_
tell
_
me
,
you
know
,
at
Barton
,
that
you
should
not
stay
above
a
_
month
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
but
I
think
,
at
the
time
,
that
you
would
most
likely
change
your
mind
when
it
come
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
such
a
great
pity
to
have
go
away
before
your
brother
and
sister
come
.
<EOS>
and
now
to
be
sure
you
will
be
in
no
_
hurry
_
to
be
go
.
<EOS>
I
be
amazingly
glad
you
do
not
keep
to
_
your
word
.
<EOS>

"
  
Elinor
perfectly
understand
her
,
and
be
force
to
use
all
her
self
-
command
to
make
it
appear
that
she
do
_
not

<EOS>
_
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Jennings
,
"
and
how
do
you
travel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
in
the
stage
,
I
assure
you
,
"
reply
Miss
Steele
,
with
quick
exultation
;
"
we
come
post
all
the
way
,
and
have
a
very
smart
beau
to
attend
us
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Davies
be
come
to
town
,
and
so
we
think
we
would
join
him
in
a
post

chaise
;

he
behave
very
genteelly
,

pay
ten

twelve
shilling
more
than
we
do

<EOS>

oh

cry
Mrs.
Jennings

very
pretty

you

"
there

say
Miss
Steele
,
affectedly
simper

"
everybody
laugh
at
me
so
about
the
Doctor

I
can
not
think
why

<EOS>
My
cousin
say
they
be
sure
I
have
make
a
conquest
;
but
for
my
part
I
declare
I
never
think
about
him

another

Lord

<EOS>
"
aye
,
aye

"
no

Mrs.

directly
give

gratifying

she
certainly

Miss

I

you

You

My

Elinor

with
great

decline
the
proposal

Her
sister
be
perhaps
lay
down
upon
the
bed

in
her
dressing
gown

therefore
not
able
to
come

Miss

"
we
can
just
as
well
go
and
see
_
her

<EOS>
"
  
Elinor
begin
to
find
this
impertinence
too
much
for
her
temper
;
but
she
be
save
the
trouble
of
check
it
,
by
Lucy
's
sharp
reprimand
,
which
now
,
as
on
many
occasion
,
though
it
do
not
give
much
sweetness
to
the
manner
of
one
sister
,
be
of
advantage
in
govern
those
of
the
other

<EOS>
after
some
opposition
,
Marianne
yield
to
her
sister
's
entreaty
,
and
consent
to
go
out
with
her
and
Mrs.
Jennings
one
morning
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
She
expressly
condition
,
however
,
for
pay
no
visit
,
and
would
do
no
more
than
accompany
them
to
Gray
's
in
Sackville
Street
,
where
Elinor
be
carry
on
a
negotiation
for
the
exchange
of
a
few
old
-
fashioned
jewel
of
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
stop
at
the
door
,
Mrs.
Jennings
recollect
that
there
be
a
lady
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
on
whom
she
ought
to
call
;
and
as
she
have
no
business
at
Gray
's
,
it
be
resolve
,
that
while
her
young
friend
transact
their
'
,
she
should
pay
her
visit
and
return
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
on
ascend
the
stair
,
the
Miss
Dashwoods
find
so
many
people
before
them
in
the
room
,
that
there
be
not
a
person
at
liberty
to
tend
to
their
order
;
and
they
be
oblige
to
wait
.
<EOS>
all
that
could
be
do
be
,
to
sit
down
at
that
end
of
the
counter
which
seem
to
promise
the
quick
succession
;
one
gentleman
only
be
stand
there
,
and
it
be
probable
that
Elinor
be
not
without
hope
of
excite
his
politeness
to
a
quick
despatch
.
<EOS>
but
the
correctness
of
his
eye
,
and
the
delicacy
of
his
taste
,
prove
to
be
beyond
his
politeness
.
<EOS>
He
be
give
order
for
a
toothpick

case
for
himself

and
till
its
size
,
shape
,
and
ornament
be

all
of
which

and
debate
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
over
every
toothpick

case
in
the
shop

finally
arrange
by
his
own
inventive
fancy

he
have
no
leisure
to
bestow
any
other
attention
on
the
two
lady
,
than
what
be
comprise
in
three
or
four
very
broad
stare
;
a
kind
of
notice
which
serve
to
imprint
on
Elinor
the
remembrance
of
a
person
and
face
,
of
strong
,
natural
,
sterling
insignificance
,
though
adorn
in
the
first
style
of
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
be
spare
from
the
troublesome
feeling
of
contempt
and
resentment
,
on
this
impertinent
examination
of
their
feature
,
and
on
the
puppyism
of
his
manner
in
decide
on
all
the
different
horror
of
the
different
toothpick
-
case
present
to
his
inspection
,
by
remain
unconscious
of
it
all
;
for
she
be
as
well
able
to
collect
her
thought
within
herself
,
and
be
as
ignorant
of
what
be
pass
around
her
,
in
Mr.
Gray
's
shop
,
as
in
her
own
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
affair
be
decide
.
<EOS>
the
ivory
,
the
gold
,
and
the
pearl
,
all
receive
their
appointment
,
and
the
gentleman
have
name
the
last
day
on
which
his
existence
could
be
continue
without
the
possession
of
the
toothpick
-
case
,
draw
on
his
glove
with
leisurely
care
,
and
bestow
another
glance
on
the
Miss
Dashwoods
,
but
such
a
one
as
seem
rather
to
demand
than
express
admiration
,
walk
off
with
a
happy
air
of
real
conceit
and
affect
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
lose
no
time
in
bring
her
business
forward
,
be
on
the
point
of
conclude
it
,
when
another
gentleman
present
himself
at
her
side
.
<EOS>
She
turn
her
eye
towards
his
face
,
and
find
him
with
some
surprise
to
be
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
Their
affection
and
pleasure
in
meeting
be
just
enough
to
make
a
very
creditable
appearance
in
Mr.
Gray
's
shop
.
<EOS>
John
Dashwood
be
really
far
from
be
sorry
to
see
his
sister
again
;
it
rather
give
them
satisfaction
;
and
his
inquiry
after
their
mother
be
respectful
and
attentive

Elinor
find
that
he

"
I

very
much
to
call
upon
you
yesterday

but
it
be
impossible

for
we
be
oblige
to
take
Harry
to
see
the
wild
beast
at
Exeter
Exchange
;
and
we
spend
the
rest
of
the

with
Mrs.

Harry

vastly
pleased

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
this
_
morning
I
have
fully
intend
to
call
on
you

if
I
could
possibly
find
a

half
hour
,
but
one
have
always
so
much
to
do
on
first
come
to
town
.
<EOS>
I
be
come
here
to
bespeak
Fanny
a
seal

<EOS>
but
tomorrow
I
think
I
shall
certainly
be
able
to
call
in
Berkeley
Street
,
and
be
introduce
to
your
friend
Mrs.
Jennings
.
<EOS>
I
understand
she
be
a
woman
of
very
good
fortune

<EOS>
and
the
Middletons
too

you
must
introduce
me
to
_
them
_

<EOS>
as
my
mother

in

I
shall
be
happy

They
be
excellent
neighbour
to
you
in
the
country

I
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
excellent

<EOS>
Their
attention
to
our
comfort

their
friendliness
in
every
particular

be
more
than
I
can
express
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
extremely
glad
to
hear
it
,
upon
my
word
;
extremely
glad
indeed
.
<EOS>
but
so
it
ought
to
be
;
they
be
people
of
large
fortune
,
they
be
relate
to
you
,
and
every
civility
and
accommodation
that
can
serve
to
make
your

pleasant

so
you

the
most
complete

that
ever

you
all
seem
to
enjoy
it
beyond

It

a
great
satisfaction

hear
it

I
assure

<EOS>
Elinor
do
feel
a
little
ashamed
of
her
brother
;
and
be
not
sorry
to
be
spare
the
necessity
of
answer
him
,
by
the
arrival
of
Mrs.
Jennings
's
servant
,
who
come
to
tell
her
that
his
mistress

Mr.
Dashwood
attend
them
down

be
introduce
to
Mrs.

at
the
door
of
her
carriage

and
repeat
his
hope
of
be
able
to
call
on
them
the
next
day
,
take
leave

His
visit
be
duly

He
come
with
a
pretence
at
an
apology
from
their
sister
-
in

law
,
for
not
come
too
;
"
but
she
be
so
much
engage
with
her
mother
,
that
really
she
have
no
leisure
for
go
any
where
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
,
however
,
assure
him
directly
,
that
she
should
not
stand
upon
ceremony
,
for
they
be
all
cousin
,
or
something
like
it
,
and
she
should
certainly
wait
on
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
very
soon
,
and
bring
her
sister
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
His
manner
to
_
them
_
,
though
calm
,
be
perfectly
kind
;
to
Mrs.
Jennings
,
most
attentively
civil
;
and
on
Colonel
Brandon
be
come
in
soon
after
himself
,
he
eye
him
with
a
curiosity
which
seem
to
say
,
that
he
only
want
to
know
him
to
be
rich
,
to
be
equally
civil
to
_
him

_
  
<EOS>
after
stay
with
them
half
an
hour

he
ask
Elinor
to
walk
with
him
to
Conduit
Street
,
and
introduce
him
to
Sir
John
and
Lady
Middleton
.
<EOS>
the
weather
be
remarkably
fine
,
and
she
readily
consent
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
out
of
the
house
,
his
enquiry
begin

<EOS>
"
who
be
Colonel
Brandon
?
<EOS>
be
he
a
man
of
fortune

<EOS>
"
yes

he

very
good
property
in
Dorsetshire

<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
it

<EOS>
He
seem
a
most
gentlemanlike
man

I
think
,
Elinor
,
I
may
congratulate
you
on
the
prospect
of
a
very
respectable
establishment
in
life
.

"
Me

<EOS>
what
do
you
mean

He
like
you

<EOS>
I
observe
him
narrowly
,
and
be
convince
of
it
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
amount
of
his
fortune
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
about
two
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
two
thousand
a

year

and
then
work
himself
up
to
a
pitch
of
enthusiastic
generosity

he
add
,
"
Elinor
,
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
it
be
_
twice

as
much

for
your
sake

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
believe
you

reply
Elinor
;
"
but
I
be
very
sure
that
Colonel
Brandon
have
not
the
small
wish
of
marrying

me

You
be
mistaken

Elinor

you
be
very
much
mistaken
.
<EOS>
a
very
little
trouble
on
your
side
secure
him
.
<EOS>
perhaps
just
at
present
he
may
be
undecided
;
the
smallness
of
your
fortune
may
make
him
hang
back
;
his
friend
may
all
advise
him
against
it
.
<EOS>
but
some
of
those
little
attention
and
encouragement
which
lady
can
so
easily
give
will
fix
him
,
in
spite
of
himself
.
<EOS>
and
there
can
be
no
reason
why
you
should
not
try
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
any
prior
attachment
on
your
side
 
in
short
,
you
know
as
to
an
attachment
of
that
kind
,
it
be
quite
out
of
the
question
,
the
objection
be
insurmountable
 
you
have
too
much
sense
not
to
see
all
that
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Brandon
must
be
the
man
;
and
no
civility
shall
be
want
on
my
part
to
make
him
pleased
with
you
and
your
family
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
match
that
must
give
universal
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
be
a
kind
of
thing
that
,
"
lower
his
voice
to
an
important
whisper
,
"
will
be
exceedingly
welcome
to
_
all
party
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
recollect
himself
,
however
,
he
add
,
"
that
is
,
I
mean
to
say
 
your
friend
be
all
truly
anxious
to
see
you
well
settle
;
Fanny
particularly
,
for
she
have
your
interest
very
much
at
heart
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
and
her
mother
too
,
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
a
very
good
-
natured
woman
,
I
be
sure
it
would
give
her
great
pleasure
;
she
say
as
much
the
other
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
would
not
vouchsafe
any
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
something
remarkable
,
now
,
"
he
continue
,
"
<EOS>
something
droll
,
if
Fanny
should
have
a
brother
and
I
a
sister
settle
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
not
very
unlikely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
Mr.
Edward
Ferrars
,
"
say
Elinor
,
with
resolution
,
"
go
to
be
marry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
actually
settle
,
but
there
be
such
a
thing
in
agitation
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
most
excellent
mother
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
with
the
utmost
liberality
,
will
come
forward
,
and
settle
on
him
a
thousand
a
year
,
if
the
match
take
place
.
<EOS>
the
lady
be
the
Hon
.
<EOS>
Miss
Morton
,
only
daughter
of
the
late
Lord
Morton
,
with
thirty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
a
very
desirable
connection
on
both
side
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
not
a
doubt
of
its
take
place
in
time
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
a
-
year
be
a
great
deal
for
a
mother
to
give
away
,
to
make
over
for
ever
;
but
Mrs.
Ferrars
have
a
noble
spirit
.
<EOS>
to
give
you
another
instance
of
her
liberality
:
 
<EOS>
the
other
day
,
as
soon
as
we
come
to
town
,
aware
that
money
could
not
be
very
plenty
with
us
just
now
,
she
put
bank
-
note
into
Fanny
's
hand
to
the
amount
of
two
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
and
extremely
acceptable
it
be
,
for
we
must
live
at
a
great
expense
while
we
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
for
her
assent
and
compassion
;
and
she
force
herself
to
say
    
"
Your
expense
both
in
town
and
country
must
certainly
be
considerable
;
but
your
income
be
a
large
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
so
large
,
I
dare
say
,
as
many
people
suppose
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
complain
,
however
;
it
be
undoubtedly
a
comfortable
one
,
and
I
hope
will
in
time
be
well
.
<EOS>
the
enclosure
of
Norland
Common
,
now
carry
on
,
be
a
most
serious
drain
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
have
make
a
little
purchase
within
this
half
year
;
East
Kingham
Farm
,
you
must
remember
the
place
,
where
old
Gibson
use
to
live
.
<EOS>
the
land
be
so
very
desirable
for
me
in
every
respect
,
so
immediately
adjoin
my
own
property
,
that
I
feel
it
my
duty
to
buy
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
answer
it
to
my
conscience
to
let
it
fall
into
any
other
hand
.
<EOS>
a
man
must
pay
for
his
convenience
;
and
it
_
have
<EOS>
_
cost
me
a
vast
deal
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
than
you
think
it
really
and
intrinsically
worth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
hope
not
that
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
sell
it
again
,
the
next
day
,
for
more
than
I
give
:
but
,
with
regard
to
the
purchase
-
money
,
I
may
have
be
very
unfortunate
indeed
;
for
the
stock
be
at
that
time
so
low
,
that
if
I
have
not
happen
to
have
the
necessary
sum
in
my
banker
's
hand
,
I
must
have
sell
out
to
very
great
loss
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
could
only
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
other
great
and
inevitable
expense
too
<EOS>
we
have
have
on
first
come
to
Norland
.
<EOS>
Our
respected
father
,
as
you
well
know
,
bequeath
all
the
Stanhill
effect
that
remain
at
Norland
(
and
very
valuable
they
be
)
to
your
mother
.
<EOS>
far
be
it
from
me
to
repine
at
his
do
so
;
he
have
an
undoubted
right
to
dispose
of
his
own
property
as
he
choose
,
but
,
in
consequence
of
it
,
we
have
be
oblige
to
make
large
purchase
of
linen
,
china
,
&
c.
to
supply
the
place
of
what
be
take
away
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
,
after
all
these
expense
,
how
very
far
we
must
be
from
be
rich
,
and
how
acceptable
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
kindness
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
say
Elinor
;
"
and
assist
by
her
liberality

,
I
hope
you
may
yet
live
to
be
in
easy
circumstance

"
  
<EOS>
"
another
year
or
two
may
do
much
towards
it
,
"
he
gravely
reply
;
"
but
however
there
be
still
a
great
deal
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
stone
lay
of

out

green

upon

<EOS>
the
old
walnut
tree
be
all
come
down

make
room
for
it

<EOS>
It
will
be
a
very
fine
object
from
many
part
of
the
park
,
and
the
flower

garden
will
slope
down
just
before
it

be
exceedingly
pretty
.
<EOS>
We
have
clear
away
all
the
old
thorn
that
grow
in
patch
over
the
brow

"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
keep
her
concern
and
her
censure
to
herself
;
and
be
very
thankful
that
Marianne
be
not
present
,
to
share
the
provocation
.
  
<EOS>
have
now
say
enough
to
make
his
poverty
clear
,
and
to
do
away
the
necessity
of
buy
a
pair
of
ear
-
ring
for
each
of
his
sister
,
in
his
next
visit
at
Gray
's
his
thought
take
a
cheerfuller
turn
,
and
he
begin
to
congratulate
Elinor
on
have
such
a
friend
as
Mrs.
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
seem
a
most
valuable
woman
indeed
 
Her
house
,
her
style
of
living
,
all
bespeak
an
exceed
good
income
;
and
it
be
an
acquaintance
that
have
not
only
be
of
great
use
to
you
hitherto
,
but
in
the
end
may
prove
materially
advantageous
.
<EOS>
Her
invite
you
to
town
be
certainly
a
vast
thing
in
your
favour
;
and
indeed
,
it
speak
altogether
so
great
a
regard
for
you
,
that
in
all
probability
when
she
die
you
will
not
be
forget
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
a
great
deal
to
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
at
all
,
I
should
rather
suppose
;
for
she
have
only
her
jointure
,
which
will
descend
to
her
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
not
to
be
imagine
that
she
live
up
to
her
income
.
<EOS>
few
people
of
common
prudence
will
do
_
that
_
;
and
whatever
she
save
,
she
will
be
able
to
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
not

it
more
likely
that

should
leave
it

to
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
daughter
be
both
exceedingly
well
married

therefore
I
can
not
perceive
the
necessity
of
her
remember
them
farther
.
<EOS>
whereas
,
in
my
opinion
,
by
her
take
so
much
notice
of
you
,
and
treat
you
in
this
kind
of
way
,
she
have
give
you
a
sort
of
claim
on
her
future
consideration
,
which
a
conscientious
woman
would
not
disregard
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
kind
than
her
behaviour

she
can
hardly
do
all
this

without
be
aware

the
expectation
it
raise

she
raise
none

those
most
concerned

indeed

your

carry
you
too

,
my

what
be
the
matter
with

she

I
be
sorry
for
that

<EOS>
at
her
time

any

an
illness
destroy
the
bloom
for
ever

<EOS>
Her

have
be
a
very
short
one

<EOS>
She
be
as
handsome
a
girl
last
September

as
I
ever
see
;

as
likely
to
attract
the
man

<EOS>
there
be
something
in
her
style

beauty

to
please
them
particularly

I
remember
Fanny
use
to
say
that
she
would

sooner

well

you

what
she

so
it
happen
to
strike
her

She
will
be
mistaken

I
question
whether
Marianne
_

will
marry
a
man
worth
more
than
five
or
six
hundred

year

at

I

,
my

I
shall
be
exceedingly
glad

more

I
can
answer

best
pleased
of
your

"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
try
very
seriously
to
convince
him
that
there
be
no
likelihood
of
her
marry
Colonel
Brandon
;
but
it
be
an
expectation
of
too
much
pleasure
to
himself
to
be
relinquish
,
and
he
be
really
resolve
on
seek
an
intimacy
with
that
gentleman
,
and
promote
the
marriage
by
every
possible
attention
.
<EOS>
He
have
just
compunction
enough
for
have
do
nothing
for
his
sister
himself
,
to
be
exceedingly
anxious
that
everybody
else
should
do
a
great
deal
;
and
an
offer
from
Colonel
Brandon
,
or
a
legacy
from
Mrs.
Jennings
,
be
the
easy
mean
of
atone
for
his

They

lucky
enough

,
to

have
be

Fanny

now

find
her
one

most
charming

Lady

equally
pleased

there
be
a
kind
of
cold
hearted
selfishness
on
both
side

which
mutually
attract
them
;
and
they
sympathise
with
each
other
in
an
insipid
propriety
of
demeanor

a
general
want

<EOS>
the

manner
,
however
,
which
recommend
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
to
the
good

Lady
Middleton
do
not
suit
the
fancy
of
Mrs.

to
_
her

she
appear
nothing
more
than
a
little
proud

look
woman
of
uncordial
address
,
who
meet
her
husband
's
sister
without
any
affection
,
and
almost
without
have
anything
to
say
to
them

for
of
the
quarter
of

bestow
on
Berkeley

she
sit
at

seven

want
very

she

ask

nothing
would
have
induce

voluntarily
to
mention
his
name

able
to
tell

his
marriage
with
Miss
Morton
be
resolve
on

till
her

expectation

occasion

<EOS>
the
intelligence
however
,
which
_
she
_
would
not
give
,
soon
flow
from
another
quarter
.
<EOS>
Lucy
come
very
shortly
to
claim
Elinor
's
compassion
on
be
unable
to
see
Edward
,
though
he
have
arrive
in
town
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Dashwood
.
<EOS>
He
dare
not
come
to
Bartlett
's
building
for
fear
of
detection
,
and
though
their
mutual
impatience
to
meet
,
be
not
to
be
tell
,
they
could
do
nothing
at
present
but
write
.
  
<EOS>
Edward
assure
them
himself
of
his
being
in
town
,
within
a
very
short
time
,
by
twice
call
in
Berkeley
Street
.
<EOS>
twice
be
his
card
find
on
the
table
,
when
they
return
from
their
morning
's
engagement
.
<EOS>
Elinor
be
pleased
that
he
have
call
;
and
still
more
pleased
that
she
have
miss
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
Dashwoods
be
so
prodigiously
delighted
with
the
Middletons
,
that
,
though
not
much
in
the
habit
of
give
anything
,
they
determine
to
give
them
 
a
dinner
;
and
soon
after
their
acquaintance
begin
,
invite
them
to
dine
in
Harley
Street
,
where
they
have
take
a
very
good
house
for
three
month
.
<EOS>
Their
sister
and
Mrs.
Jennings
be
invite
likewise
,
and
John
Dashwood
be
careful
to
secure
Colonel
Brandon
,
who
,
always
glad
to
be
where
the
Miss
Dashwoods
be
,
receive
his
eager
civility
with
some
surprise
,
but
much
more
pleasure
.
<EOS>
They
be
to
meet
Mrs.
Ferrars
;
but
Elinor
could
not
learn
whether
her
son
be
to
be
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
the
expectation
of
see
_
her
_
,
however
,
be
enough
to
make
her
interested
in
the
engagement
;
for
though
she
could
now
meet
Edward
's
mother
without
that
strong
anxiety
which
have
once
promise
to
attend
such
an
introduction
,
though
she
could
now
see
her
with
perfect
indifference
as
to
her
opinion
of
herself
,
her
desire
of
be
in
company
with
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
her
curiosity
to
know
what
she
be
like
,
be
as
lively
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
the
interest
with
which
she
thus
anticipate
the
party
,
be
soon
afterwards
increase
,
more
powerfully
than
pleasantly
,
by
her
hearing
that
the
Miss
Steeles
be
also
to
be
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
so
well
have
they
recommend
themselves
to
Lady
Middleton
,
<EOS>
so
agreeable
have
their
assiduity
make
them
to
her
,
that
though
Lucy
be
certainly
not
so
elegant
,
and
her
sister
not
even
genteel
,
she
be
as
ready
as
Sir
John
to
ask
them
to
spend
a
week
or
two
in
Conduit
Street
;
and
it
happen
to
be
particularly
convenient
to
the
Miss
Steeles
,
as
soon
as
the
Dashwoods
'
invitation
be
know
,
that
their
visit
should
begin
a
few
day
before
the
party
take
place
.
  
<EOS>
Their
claim
to
the
notice
of
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
,
as
the
niece
of
the
gentleman
who
for
many
year
have
have
the
care
of
her
brother
,
may
not
have
do
much
,
however
,
towards
procure
them
seat
at
her
table
;
but
as
Lady
Middleton
's
guest
they
must
be
welcome
;
and
Lucy
,
who
have
long
want
to
be
personally
know
to
the
family
,
to
have
a
nearer
view
of
their
character
and
her
own
difficulty
,
and
to
have
an
opportunity
of
endeavour
to
please
them
,
have
seldom
be
happy
in
her
life
,
than
she
be
on
receive
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
's
card
.
  
<EOS>
on
Elinor
its
effect
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
She
begin
immediately
to
determine
,
that
Edward
who
live
with
his
mother
,
must
be
ask
as
his
mother
be
,
to
a
party
give
by
his
sister
;
and
to
see
him
for
the
first
time
,
after
all
that
pass
,
in
the
company
of
Lucy
!
 
<EOS>
she
hardly
know
how
she
could
bear
it
!
  
<EOS>
these
apprehension
,
perhaps
,
be
not
found
entirely
on
reason
,
and
certainly
not
at
all
on
truth
.
<EOS>
They
be
relieve
however
,
not
by
her
own
recollection
,
but
by
the
good
will
of
Lucy
,
who
believe
herself
to
be
inflict
a
severe
disappointment
when
she
tell
her
that
Edward
certainly
would
not
be
in
Harley
Street
on
Tuesday
,
and
even
hope
to
be
carry
the
pain
still
farther
by
persuade
her
that
he
be
keep
away
by
the
extreme
affection
for
herself
,
which
he
could
not
conceal
when
they
be
together
.
  
<EOS>
the
important
Tuesday
come
that
be
to
introduce
the
two
young
lady
to
this
formidable
mother
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
pity
me
,
dear
Miss
Dashwood
!
<EOS>
"
say
Lucy
,
as
they
walk
up
the
stair
together
 
for
the
Middletons
arrive
so
directly
after
Mrs.
Jennings
,
that
they
all
follow
the
servant
at
the
same
time
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
nobody
here
<EOS>
but
you
,
that
can
feel
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
can
hardly
stand
.
<EOS>
good
gracious
!
 
<EOS>
in
a
moment
I
shall
see
the
person
that
all
my
happiness
depend
on
 
that
be
to
be
my
mother
!
"
    
<EOS>
Elinor
could
have
give
her
immediate
relief
by
suggest
the
possibility
of
its
be
Miss
Morton
's
mother
,
rather
than
her
own
,
whom
they
be
about
to
behold
;
but
instead
of
do
that
,
she
assure
her
,
and
with
great
sincerity
,
that
she
do
pity
her
 
to
the
utter
amazement
of
Lucy
,
who
,
though
really
uncomfortable
herself
,
hope
at
least
to
be
an
object
of
irrepressible
envy
to
Elinor
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ferrars
be
a
little
,
thin
woman
,
upright
,
even
to
formality
,
in
her
figure
,
and
serious
,
even
to
sourness
,
in
her
aspect
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
be
sallow
;
and
her
feature
small
,
without
beauty
,
and
naturally
without
expression
;
but
a
lucky
contraction
of
the
brow
have
rescue
her
countenance
from
the
disgrace
of
insipidity
,
by
give
it
the
strong
character
of
pride
and
ill
nature
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
a
woman
of
many
word
;
for
,
unlike
people
in
general
,
she
proportion
them
to
the
number
of
her
idea
;
and
of
the
few
syllable
that
do
escape
her
,
not
one
fall
to
the
share
of
Miss
Dashwood
,
whom
she
eye
with
the
spirited
determination
of
dislike
her
at
all
event
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
could
not
_
now
_
be
make
unhappy
by
this
behaviour
.
<EOS>
a
few
month
ago
it
would
have
hurt
her
exceedingly
;
but
it
be
not
in
Mrs.
Ferrars
'
power
to
distress
her
by
it
now
;
and
the
difference
of
her
manner
to
the
Miss
Steeles
,
a
difference
which
seem
purposely
make
to
humble
her
more
,
only
amuse
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
smile
to
see
the
graciousness
of
both
mother
and
daughter
towards
the
very
person
 
for
Lucy
be
particularly
distinguished
 
whom
of
all
other
,
have
they
know
as
much
as
she
do
<EOS>
,
they
would
have
be
most
anxious
to
mortify
;
while
she
herself
,
who
have
comparatively
no
power
to
wound
them
,
sit
pointedly
slight
by
both
.
<EOS>
but
while
she
smile
at
a
graciousness
so
misapplied
,
she
could
not
reflect
on
the
mean
-
spirited
folly
from
which
it
spring
,
nor
observe
the
studied
attention
with
which
the
Miss
Steeles
court
its
continuance
,
without
thoroughly
despise
them
all
four
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
be
all
exultation
on
be
so
honorably
distinguished
;
and
Miss
Steele
want
only
to
be
tease
about
Dr.
Davies
to
be
perfectly
happy
.
  
<EOS>
the
dinner
be
a
grand
one
,
the
servant
be
numerous
,
and
every
thing
bespeak
the
Mistress
's
inclination
for
show
,
and
the
Master
's
ability
to
support
it
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
the
improvement
and
addition
which
be
make
to
the
Norland
estate
,
and
in
spite
of
its
owner
have
once
be
within
some
thousand
pound
of
be
oblige
to
sell
out
at
a
loss
,
nothing
give
any
symptom
of
that
indigence
which
he
have
try
to
infer
from
it
;
no
poverty
of
any
kind
,
except
of
conversation
,
appear
;
but
there
,
the
deficiency
be
considerable
.
<EOS>
John
Dashwood
have
not
much
to
say
for
himself
that
be
worth
hearing
,
and
his
wife
have
still
less
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
peculiar
disgrace
in
this
;
for
it
be
very
much
the
case
with
the
chief
of
their
visitor
,
who
almost
all
labour
under
one
or
other
of
these
disqualification
for
be
agreeable
 
<EOS>
want
of
sense
,
<EOS>
either
natural
or
improved
 
want
of
elegance
 
want
of
spirit
 
or
want
of
temper
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
lady
withdraw
to
the
drawing
-
room
after
dinner
,
this
poverty
be
particularly
evident
,
for
the
gentleman
_
have
<EOS>
_
supply
the
discourse
with
some
variety
 
the
variety
of
politic
,
inclose
land
,
and
break
horse
 
<EOS>
but
then
it
be
all
over
;
and
one
subject
only
engage
the
lady
till
coffee
come
in
,
which
be
the
comparative
height
of
Harry
Dashwood
,
and
Lady
Middleton
's
second
son
William
,
who
be
nearly
of
the
same
age
.
  
<EOS>
have
both
the
child
be
there
,
the
affair
may
have
be
determine
too
easily
by
measure
them
at
once
;
but
as
Harry
only
be
present
,
it
be
all
conjectural
assertion
on
both
side
;
and
every
body
have
a
right
to
be
equally
positive
in
their
opinion
,
and
to
repeat
it
over
and
over
again
as
often
as
they
like
.
  
<EOS>
the
party
stand
thus
:
    
the
two
mother
,
though
each
really
convinced
that
her
own
son
be
the
tall
,
politely
decide
in
favour
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
the
two
grandmother
,
with
not
less
partiality
,
but
more
sincerity
,
be
equally
earnest
in
support
of
their
own
descendant
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
,
who
be
hardly
less
anxious
to
please
one
parent
than
the
other
,
think
the
boy
be
both
remarkably
tall
for
their
age
,
and
could
not
conceive
that
there
could
be
the
small
difference
in
the
world
between
them
;
and
Miss
Steele
,
with
yet
great
address
give
it
,
as
fast
as
she
could
,
in
favour
of
each
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
,
have
once
deliver
her
opinion
on
William
's
side
,
by
which
she
offend
Mrs.
Ferrars
and
Fanny
still
more
,
do
not
see
the
necessity
of
enforce
it
by
any
farther
assertion
;
and
Marianne
,
when
call
on
for
her
's
,
offend
them
all
,
by
declare
that
she
have
no
opinion
to
give
,
as
she
have
never
think
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
before
her
remove
from
Norland
,
Elinor
have
paint
a
very
pretty
pair
of
screen
for
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
which
be
now
just
mount
and
bring
home
,
ornament
her
present
drawing
room
;
and
these
screen
,
catch
the
eye
of
John
Dashwood
on
his
follow
the
other
gentleman
into
the
room
,
be
officiously
hand
by
him
to
Colonel
Brandon
for
his
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
"
these
be
do
by
my

"
say
he
;
"
and
you
,
as
a
man
of
taste
,
will
,
I
dare
say
,
be
pleased
with
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
you
have
ever
happen
to
see
any
of
her
performance
before
,
but
she
be
in
general
reckon
to
draw
extremely
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Colonel
,
though
disclaim
all
pretension
to
connoisseurship
,
warmly
admire
the
screen
,
as
he
would
have
do
any
thing
paint
by
Miss
Dashwood
;
and
on
the
curiosity
of
the
other
be
of
course
excited
,
they
be
hand
round
for
general
inspection
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
not
aware
of
their
be
Elinor
's
work
,
particularly
request
to
look
at
them
;
and
after
they
have
receive
gratifying
testimony
of
Lady
Middleton
's
approbation
,
Fanny
present
them
to
her
mother
,
considerately
inform
her
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
they
be
do
by
Miss
Dashwood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hum
"
 
say
Mrs.
Ferrars
 
"
very
pretty
,
"
 
and
without
regard
them
at
all
,
return
them
to
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
Fanny
think
for
a
moment
that
her
mother
have
be
quite
rude
enough
,
 
for
,
<EOS>
colour
a
little
,
she
immediately
say
    
"
They
be
very
pretty
,
madam
 
an't
they
?
"
<EOS>
but
then
again
,
the
dread
of
have
be
too
civil
,
too
encouraging
herself
,
probably
come
over
her
,
for
she
presently
add
,
"
do
you
not
think
they
be
something
in
Miss
Morton
's
style
of
painting
,
madam

<EOS>
She

paint
most

"
  
<EOS>
"
beautifully
indeed
!
<EOS>
but
_
she
_
do
every
thing
well

"
  
<EOS>
Marianne
could
not
bear
this
.
<EOS>
She
be
already
greatly
displeased
with
Mrs.
Ferrars
;
and
such
ill
-
time
praise
of
another
,
at
Elinor
's
expense
,
though
she
have
not
any
notion
of
what
be
principally
mean
by
it

provoke
her
immediately
to
say
with
warmth
    
<EOS>
"
this
be
admiration
of
a
very
particular
kind

<EOS>
what
be
Miss
Morton
to
us

<EOS>
who
know

it
be
Elinor
of
whom
<EOS>
_
we

<EOS>
and
so
say
,
she
take
the
screen
out
of
her
sister
-
in
-
law
's
hand
,
to
admire
them
herself
as
they
ought
to
be
admire
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ferrars
look
exceedingly
angry
,
and
draw
herself
up
more
stiffly
than
ever
,
pronounce
in
retort
this
bitter
philippic
,
"
Miss
Morton
be
Lord
Morton
's
daughter

<EOS>
Fanny
look
very
angry
too
,
and
her
husband
be
all
in
a
fright
at
his
sister
's
audacity
.
<EOS>
Elinor
be
much
more
hurt
by
Marianne
's
warmth
than
she
have
be
by
what
produce
it
;
but
Colonel
Brandon
's
eye
,
as
they
be
fix
on
Marianne
,
declare
that
he
notice
only
what
be
amiable
in
it
,
the
affectionate
heart
which
could
not
bear
to
see
a
sister
slight
in
the
small
point

<EOS>
Marianne
's
feeling
do
not
stop
here
.
<EOS>
the
cold
insolence
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
general
behaviour
to
her
sister

seem
,
to
her
,
to
foretell
such
difficulty
and
distress
to
Elinor

as
her
own
wound
heart
teach
her
to
think
of
with
horror
;
and
urge
by
a
strong
impulse
of
affectionate
sensibility
<EOS>
,
she
move
after
a
moment
,
to
her
sister
's
chair
,
and
put
one
arm
round
her
neck
,
and
one
cheek
close
to
her

say
in
a
low

but
eager

voice
    
"

them

<EOS>
do
not
let
them
make
_
<EOS>
you
_
unhappy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
say
no
more
;
her
spirit
be
quite
overcome
,
and
hide
her
face
on
Elinor
's
shoulder
,
she
burst
into
tear
.
<EOS>
every
body
's
attention
be
call
,
and
almost
every
body
be
concern
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Brandon
rise
up
and
go
to
them
without
know
what
he
do
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
,
with
a
very
intelligent
"
ah
!
poor
dear
,
"
immediately
give
her
her
salt
;
and
Sir
John
feel
so
desperately
enrage
against
the
author
of
this
nervous
distress
,
that
he
instantly
change
his
seat
to
one
close
by
Lucy
Steele
,
and
give
her
,
in
a
whisper
,
a
brief
account
of
the
whole
shocking
affair
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
,
however
,
Marianne
be
recover
enough
to
put
an
end
to
the
bustle
,
and
sit
down
among
the
rest
;
though
her
spirit
retain
the
impression
of
what
have
pass
,
the
whole
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Marianne
!
"
say
her
brother
to
Colonel
Brandon
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
soon
as
he
could
secure
his
attention
:
"
She
have
not
such
good
health
as
her
sister
,
 
<EOS>
she
be
very
nervous
,
 
<EOS>
she
have
not
Elinor
's
constitution
;
 
and
one
must
allow
that
there
be
something
very
try
to
a
young
woman
who
_
have
be
_
a
beauty
in
the
loss
of
her
personal
attraction
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
think
it
perhaps
,
but
Marianne
_
be
_
remarkably
handsome
a
few
month
ago
;
quite
as
handsome
as
Elinor
.
<EOS>
now
you
see
it
be
all
go
.
"
    
<EOS>
Elinor
's
curiosity
to
see
Mrs.
Ferrars
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
She
have
find
in
her
every
thing
that
could
tend
to
make
a
farth
connection
between
the
family
undesirable
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
enough
of
her
pride
,
her
meanness
,
and
her
determined
prejudice
against
herself
,
to
comprehend
all
the
difficulty
that
must
have
perplex
the
engagement
,
and
retard
the
marriage
,
of
Edward
and
herself
,
have
he
be
otherwise
free
;
 
and
she
have
see
almost
enough
to
be
thankful
for
her
<EOS>
_
own
_
sake
,
that
one
great
obstacle
preserve
her
from
suffer
under
any
other
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
creation
,
preserve
her
from
all
dependence
upon
her
caprice
,
or
any
solicitude
for
her
good
opinion
.
<EOS>
or
at
least
,
if
she
do
not
bring
herself
quite
to
rejoice
in
Edward
's
be
fetter
to
Lucy
,
she
determine
,
that
have
Lucy
be
more
amiable
,
she
_
ought
_
to
have
rejoice
.
  
<EOS>
She
wonder
that
Lucy
's
spirit
could
be
so
very
much
elevate
by
the
civility
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
;
 
that
her
interest
and
her
vanity
should
so
very
much
blind
her
as
to
make
the
attention
which
seem
only
pay
her
because
she
be
_
not
Elinor
<EOS>
_
appear
a
compliment
to
herself
 
or
to
allow
her
to
derive
encouragement
from
a
preference
only
give
her
,
because
her
real
situation
be
unknown
.
<EOS>
but
that
it
be
so
,
have
not
only
be
declare
by
Lucy
's
eye
at
the
time
,
but
be
declare
over
again
the
next
morning
more
openly
,
for
at
her
particular
desire
,
Lady
Middleton
set
her
down
in
Berkeley
Street
on
the
chance
of
see
Elinor
alone
,
to
tell
her
how
happy
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
chance
prove
a
lucky
one
,
for
a
message
from
Mrs.
Palmer
soon
after
she
arrive
,
carry
Mrs.
Jennings
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
friend
,
"
cry
Lucy
,
as
soon
as
they
be
by
themselves
,
"
I
come
to
talk
to
you
of
my
happiness
.
<EOS>
Could
anything
be
so
flattering
as
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
way
of
treat
me
yesterday
?
<EOS>
so
exceed
affable
as
she
be
!
<EOS>
You
know
how
I
dread
the
thought
of
see
her
;
but
the
very
moment
I
be
introduce
,
there
be
such
an
affability
in
her
behaviour
as
really
should
seem
to
say
,
she
have
quite
take
a
fancy
to
me
.
<EOS>
now
be
not
it
so
?
<EOS>
You
see
it
all
;
and
be
not
you
quite
strike
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
certainly
very
civil
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
civil
!
 
<EOS>
do
you
see
nothing
but
only
civility
?
 
<EOS>
I
see
a
vast
deal
more
.
<EOS>
such
kindness
as
fall
to
the
share
of
nobody
but
me
!
 
<EOS>
no
pride
,
no
hauteur
,
and
your
sister
just
the
same
 
all
sweetness
and
affability
!
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
wish
to
talk
of
something
else
,
but
Lucy
still
press
her
to
own
that
she
have
reason
for
her
happiness
;
and
Elinor
be
oblige
to
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
undoubtedly
,
if
they
have
know
your
engagement
,
"
say
she
,
"
nothing
could
be
more
flattering
than
their
treatment
of
you
;
 
but
as
that
be
not
the
case
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
guess
you
would
say
so
,
"
reply
Lucy
quickly
 
"
but
there
be
no
reason
in
the
world
why
Mrs.
Ferrars
should
seem
to
like
me
,
if
she
do
not
,
and
her
like
me
be
every
thing
.
<EOS>
You
shall
not
talk
me
out
of
my
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
will
all
end
well
,
and
there
will
be
no
difficulty
at
all
,
to
what
I
use
to
think
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ferrars
be
a
charming
woman
,
and
so
be
your
sister
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
delightful
woman
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
I
should
never
hear
you
say
how
agreeable
Mrs.
Dashwood
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
Elinor
have
no
answer
to
make
,
and
do
not
attempt
any
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
ill
,
Miss
Dashwood
?
 
<EOS>
you
seem
low
 
<EOS>
you
do
not
speak
;
 
<EOS>
sure
you
an't
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
be
in
well
health
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
it
with
all
my
heart
;
but
really
you
do
not
look
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
have
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
ill
<EOS>
;
you
,
that
have
be
the
great
comfort
to
me
in
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
Heaven
know
what
I
should
have
do
without
your
friendship
.
"
    
<EOS>
Elinor
try
to
make
a
civil
answer
,
though
doubt
her
own
success
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
to
satisfy
Lucy
,
<EOS>
for
she
directly
reply
    
"
indeed
I
be
perfectly
convince
of
your
regard
for
me
,
and
next
to
Edward
's
love
,
it
be
the
great
comfort
I
have
.
<EOS>
poor
Edward
!
 
<EOS>
but
now
there
be
one
good
thing
<EOS>
,
we
shall
be
able
to
meet
,
and
meet
pretty
often
,
for
Lady
Middleton
's
delight
with
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
so
we
shall
be
a
good
deal
in
Harley
Street
,
I
dare
say
,
and
Edward
spend
half
his
time
with
his
sister
 
besides
,
Lady
Middleton
and
Mrs.
Ferrars
will
visit
now
;
 
and
Mrs.
Ferrars
and
your
sister
be
both
so
good
to
say
more
than
once
,
they
should
always
be
glad
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
They
be
such
charming
woman
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
if
ever
you
tell
your
sister
what
I
think
of
her
,
you
can
not
speak
too
high
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Elinor
would
not
give
her
any
encouragement
to
hope
that
she
_
should
_
tell
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Lucy
continue
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
should
have
see
it
in
a
moment
,
if
Mrs.
Ferrars
have
take
a
dislike
to
me
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
only
make
me
a
formal
courtesy
,
for
instance
,
without
say
a
word
,
and
never
after
have
take
any
notice
of
me
,
and
never
look
at
me
in
a
pleasant
way
 
<EOS>
you
know
what
I
mean
 
if
I
have
be
treat
in
that
forbid
sort
of
way
,
I
should
have
give
it
all
up
in
despair
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
stand
it
.
<EOS>
for
where
she
_
do
_
dislike
,
I
know
it
be
most
violent
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
be
prevent
from
make
any
reply
to
this
civil
triumph
,
by
the
door
's
be
throw
open
,
the
servant
's
announce
Mr.
Ferrars
,
and
Edward
's
immediately
walk
in
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
awkward
moment
;
and
the
countenance
of
each
show
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
They
all
look
exceedingly
foolish
;
and
Edward
seem
to
have
as
great
an
inclination
to
walk
out
of
the
room
again
,
as
to
advance
farther
into
it
.
<EOS>
the
very
circumstance
,
in
its
unpleasant
form
,
which
they
would
each
have
be
most
anxious
to
avoid
,
have
fall
on
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
only
all
three
together
,
but
be
together
without
the
relief
of
any
other
person
.
<EOS>
the
lady
recover
themselves
first
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
Lucy
's
business
to
put
herself
forward
,
and
the
appearance
of
secrecy
must
still
be
keep
up
.
<EOS>
She
could
therefore
only
_
look
_
her
tenderness
,
and
after
slightly
address
him
,
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
but
Elinor
have
more
to
do
;
and
so
anxious
be
she
,
for
his
sake
and
her
own
,
to
do
it
well
,
that
she
force
herself
,
after
a
moment
's
recollection
,
to
welcome
him
,
with
a
look
and
manner
that
be
almost
easy
,
and
almost
open
;
and
another
struggle
,
another
effort
still
improve
them
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
allow
the
presence
of
Lucy
,
nor
the
consciousness
of
some
injustice
towards
herself
,
to
deter
her
from
say
that
she
be
happy
to
see
him
,
and
that
she
have
very
much
regretted
be
from
home
,
when
he
call
before
in
Berkeley
Street
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
be
frighten
from
pay
him
those
attention
which
,
as
a
friend
and
almost
a
relation
,
be
his
due
,
by
the
observant
eye
of
Lucy
,
though
she
soon
perceive
them
to
be
narrowly
watch
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
manner
give
some
re
-
assurance
to
Edward
,
and
he
have
courage
enough
to
sit
down
;
but
his
embarrassment
still
exceed
that
of
the
lady
in
a
proportion
,
which
the
case
render
reasonable
,
though
his
sex
may
make
it
rare
;
for
his
heart
have
not
the
indifference
of
Lucy
's
,
nor
could
his
conscience
have
quite
the
ease
of
Elinor
's
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
,
with
a
demure
and
settle
air
,
seem
determined
to
make
no
contribution
to
the
comfort
of
the
other
,
and
would
not
say
a
word
;
and
almost
every
thing
that
_
be
_
say
,
proceed
from
Elinor
,
who
be
oblige
to
volunteer
all
the
information
about
her
mother
's
health
,
their
come
to
town
,
&
c.
which
Edward
ought
to
have
inquire
about
,
but
never
do
.
  
<EOS>
Her
exertion
do
not
stop
here
;
for
she
soon
afterwards
feel
herself
so
heroically
disposed
as
to
determine
,
under
pretence
of
fetch
Marianne
,
to
leave
the
other
by
themselves
;
and
she
really
do
it
,
and
_
that
_
<EOS>
in
the
handsome
manner
,
for
she
loiter
away
several
minute
on
the
landing
-
place
,
with
the
most
high
-
minded
fortitude
,
before
she
go
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
when
that
be
once
do
,
however
,
it
be
time
for
the
rapture
of
Edward
to
cease
;
for
Marianne
's
joy
hurry
her
into
the
drawing
-
room
immediately
.
<EOS>
Her
pleasure
in
see
him
be
like
every
other
of
her
feeling
,
strong
in
itself
,
and
strongly
spoken
.
<EOS>
She
meet
him
with
a
hand
that
would
be
take
,
and
a
voice
that
express
the
affection
of
a
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
Edward
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
"
this
be
a
moment
of
great
happiness
!
 
<EOS>
this
would
almost
make
amend
for
every
thing
?
"
  
<EOS>
Edward
try
to
return
her
kindness
as
it
deserve
,
but
before
such
witness
he
dare
not
say
half
what
he
really
feel
.
<EOS>
again
they
all
sit
down
,
and
for
a
moment
or
two
all
be
silent
;
while
Marianne
be
look
with
the
most
speak
tenderness
,
sometimes
at
Edward
and
sometimes
at
Elinor
,
regret
only
that
their
delight
in
each
other
should
be
check
by
Lucy
's
unwelcome
presence
.
<EOS>
Edward
be
the
first
to
speak
,
and
it
be
to
notice
Marianne
's
alter
look
,
and
express
his
fear
of
her
not
find
London
agree
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
not
think
of
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
reply
with
spirited
earnestness
,
though
her
eye
be
fill
with
tear
as
she
speak
,
"
do
not
think
of
_
my
_
health
.
<EOS>
Elinor
be
well
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
that
must
be
enough
for
us
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
remark
be
not
calculate
to
make
Edward
or
Elinor
more
easy
,
nor
to
conciliate
the
good
will
of
Lucy
,
who
look
up
at
Marianne
with
no
very
benignant
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
like
London
?
"
say
Edward
,
willing
to
say
any
thing
that
may
introduce
another
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
expect
much
pleasure
in
it
,
but
I
have
find
none
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
you
,
Edward
,
be
the
only
comfort
it
have
afford
;
and
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
you
be
what
you
always
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
 
<EOS>
no
one
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Elinor
,
"
she
presently
add
,
"
we
must
employ
Edward
to
take
care
of
us
in
our
return
to
Barton
.
<EOS>
in
a
week
or
two
,
I
suppose
,
we
shall
be
go
;
and
,
I
trust
,
Edward
will
not
be
very
unwilling
to
accept
the
charge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Edward
mutter
something
,
but
what
it
be
,
nobody
know
,
not
even
himself
.
<EOS>
but
Marianne
,
who
see
his
agitation
,
and
could
easily
trace
it
to
whatever
cause
<EOS>
best
please
herself
,
be
perfectly
satisfied
,
and
soon
talk
of
something
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
spend
such
a
day
,
Edward
,
in
Harley
Street
yesterday
!
<EOS>
so
dull
,
so
wretchedly
dull
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
much
to
say
to
you
on
that
head
,
which
can
not
be
say
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
with
this
admirable
discretion
do
she
defer
the
assurance

their
mutual

more
disagreeable
than
ever

of
her

particularly
disgust
with
his
mother

they

more
in
private

<EOS>
"
but
why

you
not

,
Edward

why

you

I

what
be
that

when
such
friend
be
to

meet

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
Miss
Marianne
,
"
cry
Lucy
,
eager
to
take
some
revenge
on
her
,
"
you
think
young
man
never
stand
upon
engagement
,
if
they
have
no
mind
to
keep
them
,
little
as
well
as
great
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
be
very
angry
,
but
Marianne
seem
entirely
insensible
of
the
ste
;
for
she
calmly
reply
    
"
not
so
,
indeed
;
for
,
seriously
speak
,
I
be
very
sure
that
conscience
only
keep
Edward
from
Harley
Street
.
<EOS>
and
I
really
believe
he
_
have
_
the
most
delicate
conscience
in
the
world
;
<EOS>
the
most
scrupulous
in
perform
every
engagement
,
however
minute
,
and
however
it
may
make
against
his
interest
or
pleasure
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
most
fearful
of
give
pain
,
of
wound
expectation
,
and
the
most
incapable
of
be
selfish
,
of
any
body
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
Edward
,
it
be
so
,
and
I
will
say
it
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
be
you
never
to
hear
yourself
praise
!
 
<EOS>
then
you
must
be
no
friend
of
mine
;
for
those
who
will
accept
of
my
love
and
esteem
,
must
submit
to
my
open
commendation
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
nature
of
her
commendation
,
in
the
present
case
,
however
,
happen
to
be
particularly
ill
-
suit
to
the
feeling
of
two
third
of
her
auditor
,
and
be
so
very
unexhilarating
to
Edward
,
that
he
very
soon
get
up
to
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
so
soon
!
"
<EOS>
say
Marianne
;
"
my
dear
Edward
,
this
must
not
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
draw
him
a
little
aside
,
she
whisper
her
persuasion
that
Lucy
could
not
stay
much
long
.
<EOS>
but
even
this
encouragement
fail
,
for
he
would
go
;
and
Lucy
,
who
would
have
outstay
him
,
have
his
visit
last
two
hour
,
soon
afterwards
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
bring
her
here
so
often
?
"
say
Marianne
,
on
her
leave
them
.
"
<EOS>
Could
not
she
see
that
we
want
her
go
!
 
<EOS>
how
teasing
to
Edward
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
 
<EOS>
we
be
all
his
friend
,
and
Lucy
have
be
the
longest
known
to
him
of
any
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
natural
that
he
should
like
to
see
her
as
well
as
ourselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Marianne
look
at
her
steadily
,
and
say
,
"
You
know
,
Elinor
,
that
this
be
a
kind
of
talking
which
I
can
not
bear
.
<EOS>
if
you
only
hope
to
have
your
assertion
contradict
,
as
I
must
suppose
to
be
the
case
,
you
ought
to
recollect
that
I
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
descend
to
be
trick
out
of
assurance
,
that
be
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
leave
the
room
;
and
Elinor
dare
not
follow
her
to
say
more
,
for
bind
as
she
be
by
her
promise
of
secrecy
to
Lucy
,
she
could
give
no
information
that
would
convince
Marianne
;
and
painful
as
the
consequence
of
her
still
continue
in
an
error
may
be
,
she
be
oblige
to
submit
to
it
.
<EOS>
all
that
she
could
hope
,
be
that
Edward
would
not
often
expose
her
or
himself
to
the
distress
of
hear
Marianne
's
mistaken
warmth
,
nor
to
the
repetition
of
any
other
part
of
the
pain
that
have
attend
their
recent
meeting
 
and
this
she
have
every
reason
to
expect
.
    
<EOS>
within
a
few
day
after
this
meeting
,
the
newspaper
announce
to
the
world
,
that
the
lady
of
Thomas
Palmer
,
Esq
.
be
safely
deliver
of
a
son
and
heir
;
a
very
interesting
and
satisfactory
paragraph
,
at
least
to
all
those
intimate
connection
who
know
it
before
.
  
<EOS>
this
event
,
highly
important
to
Mrs.
Jennings
's
happiness
,
produce
a
temporary
alteration
in
the
disposal
of
her
time
,
and
influence
,
in
a
like
degree
,
the
engagement
of
her
young
friend
;
for
as
she
wish
to
be
as
much
as
possible
with
Charlotte
,
she
go
thither
every
morning
as
soon
as
she
be
dress
,
and
do
not
return
till
late
in
the
evening
;
and
the
Miss
Dashwoods
,
at
the
particular
request
of
the
Middletons
,
spend
the
whole
of
every
day
,
in
Conduit
Street
.
<EOS>
for
their
own
comfort
they
would
much
rather
have
remain
,
at
least
all
the
morning
,
in
Mrs.
Jennings
's
house
;
but
it
be
not
a
thing
to
be
urge
against
the
wish
of
everybody
.
<EOS>
Their
hour
be
therefore
make
over
to
Lady
Middleton
and
the
two
Miss
Steeles
,
by
whom
their
company
,
in
fact
be
as
little
value
,
as
it
be
professedly
seek
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
too
much
sense
to
be
desirable
companion
to
the
former
;
and
by
the
latter
they
be
consider
with
a
jealous
eye
,
as
intrude
on
_
their
_
ground
,
and
share
the
kindness
which
they
want
to
monopolize
.
<EOS>
though
nothing
could
be
more
polite
than
Lady
Middleton
's
behaviour
to
Elinor
and
Marianne
,
she
do
not
really
like
them
at
all
.
<EOS>
because
they
neither
flatter
herself
nor
her
child
,
she
could
not
believe
them
good
-
natured
;
and
because
they
be
fond
of
reading
,
she
fancy
them
satirical
:
perhaps
without
exactly
know
what
it
be
to
be
satirical
;
but
_
that
_
do
not
signify
.
<EOS>
It
be
censure
in
common
use
,
and
easily
give
.
  
<EOS>
Their
presence
be
a
restraint
both
on
her
and
on
Lucy
.
<EOS>
It
check
the
idleness
of
one
,
and
the
business
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
Lady
Middleton
be
ashamed
of
do
nothing
before
them
,
and
the
flattery
which
Lucy
be
proud
to
think
of
and
administer
at
other
time
,
she
fear
they
would
despise
her
for
offering
.
<EOS>
Miss
Steele
be
the
least
discompose
of
the
three
,
by
their
presence
;
and
it
be
in
their
power
to
reconcile
her
to
it
entirely
.
<EOS>
Would
either
of
them
only
have
give
her
a
full
and
minute
account
of
the
whole
affair
between
Marianne
and
Mr.
Willoughby
,
she
would
have
think
herself
amply
reward
for
the
sacrifice
of
the
good
place
by
the
fire
after
dinner
,
which
their
arrival
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
this
conciliation
be
not
grant
;
for
though
she
often
throw
out
expression
of
pity
for
her
sister
to
Elinor
,
and
more
than
once
dropt
a
reflection
on
the
inconstancy
of
beaux
before
Marianne
,
no
effect
be
produce
,
but
a
look
of
indifference
from
the
former
,
or
of
disgust
in
the
latter
.
<EOS>
an
effort
even
yet
light
may
have
make
her
their
friend
.
<EOS>
Would
they
only
have
laugh
at
her
about
the
Doctor
!
<EOS>
but
so
little
be
they
,
anymore
than
the
other
,
incline
to
oblige
her
,
that
if
Sir
John
dine
from
home
,
she
may
spend
a
whole
day
without
hear
any
other
raillery
on
the
subject
,
than
what
she
be
kind
enough
to
bestow
on
herself
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
jealousy
and
discontent
,
however
,
be
so
totally
unsuspected
by
Mrs.
Jennings
<EOS>
,
that
she
think
it
a
delightful
thing
for
the
girl
to
be
together
;
and
generally
congratulate
her
young
friend
every
night
,
on
have
escape
the
company
of
a
stupid
old
woman
so
long
.
<EOS>
She
join
them
sometimes
at
Sir
John
's
,
sometimes
at
her
own
house
;
but
wherever
it
be
,
she
always
come
in
excellent
spirit
,
full
of
delight
and
importance
,
attribute
Charlotte
's
well
do
to
her
own
care
,
and
ready
to
give
so
exact
,
so
minute
a
detail
of
her
situation
,
as
only
Miss
Steele
have
curiosity
enough
to
desire
.
<EOS>
one
thing
_
do
_
disturb
her
;
and
of
that
she
make
her
daily
complaint
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palmer
maintain
the
common
,
but
unfatherly
opinion
among
his
sex
,
of
all
infant
be
alike
;
and
though
she
could
plainly
perceive
,
at
different
time
,
the
most
striking
resemblance
between
this
baby
and
every
one
of
his
relation
on
both
side
,
there
be
no
convince
his
father
of
it
;
no
persuade
him
to
believe
that
it
be
not
exactly
like
every
other
baby
of
the
same
age
;
nor
could
he
even
be
bring
to
acknowledge
the
simple
proposition
of
its
be
the
fine
child
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
now
to
the
relation
of
a
misfortune
,
which
about
this
time
befall
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
.
<EOS>
It
so
happen
that
while
her
two
sister
with
Mrs.
Jennings
be
first
call
on
her
in
Harley
Street
,
another
of
her
acquaintance
have
dropt
in
 
a
circumstance
in
itself
not
apparently
likely
to
produce
evil
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
while
the
imagination
of
other
people
will
carry
them
away
to
form
wrong
judgment
of
our
conduct
,
and
to
decide
on
it
by
slight
appearance
,
one
's
happiness
must
in
some
measure
be
always
at
the
mercy
of
chance
.
<EOS>
in
the
present
instance
,
this
last
-
arrive
lady
allow
her
fancy
to
so
far
outrun
truth
and
probability
,
that
on
merely
hear
the
name
of
the
Miss
Dashwoods
,
and
understand
them
to
be
Mr.
Dashwood
's
sister
,
she
immediately
conclude
them
to
be
stay
in
Harley
Street
;
and
this
misconstruction
produce
within
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
card
of
invitation
for
them
as
well
as
for
their
brother
and
sister
,
to
a
small
musical
party
at
her
house
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
which
be
,
that
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
be
oblige
to
submit
not
only
to
the
exceedingly
great
inconvenience
of
send
her
carriage
for
the
Miss
Dashwoods
,
but
,
what
be
still
bad
,
must
be
subject
to
all
the
unpleasantness
of
appear
to
treat
them
with
attention
:
and
who
could
tell
that
they
may
not
expect
to
go
out
with
her
a
second
time
?
<EOS>
the
power
of
disappoint
them
,
it
be
true
,
must
always
be
her
's
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
enough
;
for
when
people
be
determine
on
a
mode
of
conduct
which
they
know
to
be
wrong
,
they
feel
injure
by
the
expectation
of
any
thing
well
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
have
now
be
bring
by
degree
,
so
much
into
the
habit
of
go
out
every
day
,
that
it
be
become
a
matter
of
indifference
to
her
,
whether
she
go
or
not
:
and
she
prepare
quietly
and
mechanically
for
every
evening
's
engagement
,
though
without
expect
the
small
amusement
from
any
,
and
very
often
without
know
,
till
the
last
moment
,
where
it
be
to
take
her
.
  
<EOS>
to
her
dress
and
appearance
she
be
grow
so
perfectly
indifferent
,
as
not
to
bestow
half
the
consideration
on
it
,
during
the
whole
of
her
toilet
,
which
it
receive
from
Miss
Steele
in
the
first
five
minute
of
their
be
together
,
when
it
be
finish
.
<EOS>
nothing
escape
_
her
_
minute
observation
and
general
curiosity
;
she
see
every
thing
,
and
ask
every
thing
;
be
never
easy
till
she
know
the
price
of
every
part
of
Marianne
's
dress
;
could
have
guess
the
number
of
her
gown
altogether
with
well
judgment
than
Marianne
herself
,
and
be
not
without
hope
of
find
out
before
they
part
,
how
much
her
washing
cost
per
week
,
and
how
much
she
have
every
year
to
spend
upon
herself
.
<EOS>
the
impertinence
of
these
kind
of
scrutiny
,
moreover
,
be
generally
conclude
with
a
compliment
,
which
though
mean
as
its
douceur
,
be
consider
by
Marianne
as
the
great
impertinence
of
all
;
for
after
undergo
an
examination
into
the
value
and
make
of
her
gown
,
the
colour
of
her
shoe
,
and
the
arrangement
of
her
hair
,
she
be
almost
sure
of
be
tell
that
upon
"
her
word
she
look
vastly
smart
,
and
she
dare
to
say
she
would
make
a
great
many
conquest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
such
encouragement
as
this
,
be
she
dismiss
on
the
present
occasion
,
to
her
brother
's
carriage
;
which
they
be
ready
to
enter
five
minute
after
it
stop
at
the
door
,
a
punctuality
not
very
agreeable
to
their
sister
-
in
-
law
,
who
have
precede
them
to
the
house
of
her
acquaintance
,
and
be
there
hope
for
some
delay
on
their
part
that
may
inconvenience
either
herself
or
her
coachman
.
  
<EOS>
the
event
of
this
evening
be
not
very
remarkable
.
<EOS>
the
party
,
like
other
musical
party
,
comprehend
a
great
many
people
who
have
real
taste
for
the
performance
,
and
a
great
many
more
who
have
none
at
all
;
and
the
performer
themselves
be
,
as
usual
,
in
their
own
estimation
,
and
that
of
their
immediate
friend
,
the
first
private
performer
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
as
Elinor
be
neither
musical
,
nor
affect
to
be
so
,
she
make
no
scruple
of
turn
her
eye
from
the
grand
pianoforte
,
whenever
it
suit
her
,
and
unrestraine
even
by
the
presence
of
a
harp
,
and
violoncello
,
would
fix
them
at
pleasure
on
any
other
object
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
excursive
glance
she
perceive
among
a
group
of
young
man
,
the
very
he
,
who
have
give
them
a
lecture
on
toothpick
-
case
at
Gray
's
.
<EOS>
She
perceive
him
soon
afterwards
look
at
herself
,
and
speak
familiarly
to
her
brother
;
and
have
just
determine
to
find
out
his
name
from
the
latter
,
when
they
both
come
towards
her
,
and
Mr.
Dashwood
introduce
him
to
her
as
Mr.
Robert
Ferrars
.
  
<EOS>
He
address
her
with
easy
civility
,
and
twist
his
head
into
a
bow
which
assure
her
as
plainly
as
word
could
have
do
,
that
he
be
exactly
the
coxcomb
she
have
hear
him
describe
to
be
by
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Happy
have
it
be
for
her
,
if
her
regard
for
Edward
have
depend
less
on
his
own
merit
,
than
on
the
merit
of
his
near
relation
!
<EOS>
for
then
his
brother
's
bow
must
have
give
the
finish
stroke
to
what
the
ill
-
humour
of
his
mother
and
sister
would
have
begin
.
<EOS>
but
while
she
wonder
at
the
difference
of
the
two
young
man
,
she
do
not
find
that
the
emptiness
of
conceit
of
the
one
,
put
her
out
of
all
charity
with
the

why
they

different

,
Robert
exclaim
to
her
himself
in
the
course
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
conversation
;
for
,
talk
of
his
brother
,
and
lament
the
extreme
_
gaucherie
_
which
he
really
believe
keep
him
from
mix
in
proper
society
,
he
candidly
and
generously
attribute
it
much
less
to
any
natural
deficiency
,
than
to
the
misfortune
of
a
private
education
;
while
he
himself
,
though
probably
without
any
particular
,
any
material
superiority
by
nature
,
merely
from
the
advantage
of
a
public
school
,
be
as
well
fit
to
mix
in
the

as
any
other
man

<EOS>
"
upon
my
soul

"
he
add
,
"
I
believe
it
be
nothing
more
;
and
so
I
often
tell
my
mother
,
when
she
be
grieve
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Madam
,
"
I
always
say
to
her
,
"
you
must
make
yourself
easy
.
<EOS>
the
evil
be
now
irremediable
,
and
it
have
be
entirely
your
own
doing
.
<EOS>
why
would
you
be
persuade
by
my
uncle
,
Sir
Robert
,
against
your
own
judgment
,
to
place
Edward
under
private
tuition
,
at
the
most
critical
time
of
his
life
?
<EOS>
if
you
have
only
send
him
to
Westminster
as
well
as
myself
,
instead
of
send
him
to
Mr.
Pratt
's
,
all
this
would
have
be
prevent
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
way
in
which
I
always
consider
the
matter
,
and
my
mother
be
perfectly
convince
of
her
error
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
would
not
oppose
his
opinion
,
because
,
whatever
may
be
her
general
estimation
of
the
advantage
of
a
public
school
,
she
could
not
think
of
Edward
's
abode
in
Mr.
Pratt
's
family
,
with
any
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
reside
in
Devonshire
,
I
think
,
"
 
be
his
next
observation
,
"
in
a
cottage
near
Dawlish
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
set
him
right
as
to
its
situation
;
and
it
seem
rather
surprising
to
him
that
anybody
could
live
in
Devonshire
,
without
live
near
Dawlish
.
<EOS>
He
bestow
his
hearty
approbation
however
on
their
specie
of
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
my
own
part
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
I
be
excessively
fond
of
a
cottage
;
there
be
always
so
much
comfort
,
so
much
elegance
about
them
.
<EOS>
and
I
protest
,
if
I
have
any
money
to
spare
,
I
should
buy
a
little
land
and
build
one
myself
,
within
a
short
distance
of
London
,
where
I
may
drive
myself
down
at
any
time
,
and
collect
a
few
friend
about
me
,
and
be
happy
.
<EOS>
I
advise
every
body
who
be
go
to
build
,
to
build
a
cottage
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Lord
Courtland
come
to
me
the
other
day
on
purpose
to
ask
my
advice
,
and
lay
before
me
three
different
plan
of
Bonomi
's
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
decide
on
the
good
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Courtland
,
"
say
I
,
immediately
throw
them
all
into
the
fire
,
"
do
not
adopt
either
of
them
,
but
by
all
mean
build
a
cottage
.
"
<EOS>
and
that
I
fancy
,
will
be
the
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
some
people
imagine
that
there
can
be
no
accommodation
,
no
space
in
a
cottage
;
but
this
be
all
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
be
last
month
at
my
friend
Elliott
's
,
near
Dartford
.
<EOS>
Lady
Elliott
wish
to
give
a
dance
.
"
<EOS>
but
how
can
it
be
do
?
"
<EOS>
say
she
;
"
<EOS>
my
dear
ferrar
,
do
tell
me
how
it
be
to
be
manage
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
room
in
this
cottage
that
will
hold
ten
couple
,
and
where
can
the
supper
be
?
<EOS>
"
I
immediately
see
that
there
could
be
no
difficulty
in
it
,
so
I
say
,
"
My
dear
Lady
Elliott
,
do
not
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
the
dining
parlour
will
admit
eighteen
couple
with
ease
;
card
-
table
may
be
place
in
the
drawing
-
room
;
the
library
may
be
open
for
tea
and
other
refreshment
;
and
let
the
supper
be
set
out
in
the
saloon
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Elliott
be
delight
with
the
thought
.
<EOS>
We
measure
the
dining
-
room
,
and
find
it
would
hold
exactly
eighteen
couple
,
and
the
affair
be
arrange
precisely
after
my
plan
.
<EOS>
so
that
,
in
fact
,
you
see
,
if
people
do
but
know
how
to
set
about
it
,
every
comfort
may
be
as
well
enjoy
in
a
cottage
as
in
the
most
spacious
dwelling
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
agree
to
it
all
,
for
she
do
not
think
he
deserve
the
compliment
of
rational
opposition
.
  
<EOS>
as
John
Dashwood
have
no
more
pleasure
in
music
than
his
eld
sister
,
his
mind
be
equally
at
liberty
to
fix
on
any
thing
else
;
and
a
thought
strike
him
during
the
evening
,
which
he
communicate
to
his
wife
,
for
her
approbation
,
when
they
get
home
.
<EOS>
the
consideration
of
Mrs.
Dennison
's
mistake
,
in
suppose
his
sister
their
guest
,
have
suggest
the
propriety
of
their
be
really
invite
to
become
such
,
while
Mrs.
Jennings
's
engagement
keep
her
from
home
.
<EOS>
the
expense
would
be
nothing
,
the
inconvenience
not
more
;
and
it
be
altogether
an
attention
which
the
delicacy
of
his
conscience
point
out
to
be
requisite
to
its
complete
enfranchisement
from
his
promise
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
startle
at
the
proposal
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
do
,
"
say
she
,
"
without
affront
Lady
Middleton
,
for
they
spend
every
day
with
her
;
otherwise
I
should
be
exceedingly
glad
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
be
always
ready
to
pay
them
any
attention
in
my
power
,
as
my
take
them
out
this
evening
show
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
Lady
Middleton
's
visitor
.
<EOS>
how
can
I
ask
them
away
from
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
but
with
great
humility
,
do
not
see
the
force
of
her
objection
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
already
spend
a
week
in
this
manner
in
Conduit
Street
,
and
Lady
Middleton
could
not
be
displease
at
their
give
the
same
number
of
day
to
such
near
relation
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
pause
a
moment
,
and
then
,
with
fresh
vigor
,
say
    
"
My
love
I
would
ask
them
with
all
my
heart
,
if
it
be
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
just
settle
within
myself
to
ask
the
Miss
Steeles
to
spend
a
few
day
with
us
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
well
behaved
,
good
kind
of
girl
;
and
I
think
the
attention
be
due
to
them
,
as
their
uncle
do
so
very
well
by
Edward
.
<EOS>
We
can
ask
your
sister
some
other
year
,
you
know
;
but
the
Miss
Steeles
may
not
be
in
town
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
like
them
;
indeed
,
you
_
do
_
like
them
,
you
know
,
very
much
already
,
and
so
do
my
mother
;
and
they
be
such
favourite
with
Harry
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dashwood
be
convince
.
<EOS>
He
see
the
necessity
of
invite
the
Miss
Steeles
immediately
,
and
his
conscience
be
pacify
by
the
resolution
of
invite
his
sister
another
year
;
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
slyly
suspect
that
another
year
would
make
the
invitation
needless
,
by
bring
Elinor
to
town
as
Colonel
Brandon
's
wife
,
and
Marianne
as
_
their
_
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
,
rejoice
in
her
escape
,
and
proud
of
the
ready
wit
that
have
procure
it
,
write
the
next
morning
to
Lucy
,
to
request
her
company
and
her
sister
's
,
for
some
day
,
in
Harley
Street
,
as
soon
as
Lady
Middleton
could
spare
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
enough
to
make
Lucy
really
and
reasonably
happy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
seem
actually
work
for
her
,
herself
;
cherish
all
her
hope
,
and
promote
all
her
view
!
<EOS>
such
an
opportunity
of
be
with
Edward
and
his
family
be
,
above
all
thing
,
the
most
material
to
her
interest
,
and
such
an
invitation
the
most
gratifying
to
her
feeling
!
<EOS>
It
be
an
advantage
that
could
not
be
too
gratefully
acknowledge
,
nor
too
speedily
make
use
of
;
and
the
visit
to
Lady
Middleton
,
which
have
not
before
have
any
precise
limit
,
be
instantly
discover
to
have
be
always
mean
to
end
in
two
day
'
time
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
note
be
show
to
Elinor
,
as
it
be
within
ten
minute
after
its
arrival
,
it
give
her
,
for
the
first
time
,
some
share
in
the
expectation
of
Lucy
;
for
such
a
mark
of
uncommon
kindness
,
vouchsafe
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
,
seem
to
declare
that
the
good
-
will
towards
her
arise
from
something
more
than
merely
malice
against
herself
;
and
may
be
bring
,
by
time
and
address
,
to
do
every
thing
that
Lucy
wish
.
<EOS>
Her
flattery
have
already
subdue
the
pride
of
Lady
Middleton
,
and
make
an
entry
into
the
close
heart
of
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
;
and
these
be
effect
that
lay
open
the
probability
of
great
.
  
<EOS>
the
Miss
Steeles
remove
to
Harley
Street
,
and
all
that
reach
Elinor
of
their
influence
there
,
strengthen
her
expectation
of
the
event
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
,
who
call
on
them
more
than
once
,
bring
home
such
account
of
the
favour
they
be
in
,
as
must
be
universally
striking
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
have
never
be
so
much
pleased
with
any
young
woman
in
her
life
,
as
she
be
with
them
;
have
give
each
of
them
a
needle
book
make
by
some
emigrant
;
call
Lucy
by
her
christian
name
;
and
do
not
know
whether
she
should
ever
be
able
to
part
with
them
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Palmer
be
so
well
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
,
that
her
mother
feel
it
no
longer
necessary
to
give
up
the
whole
of
her
time
to
her
;
and
,
content
herself
with
visit
her
once
or
twice
a
day
,
return
from
that
period
to
her
own
home
,
and
her
own
habit
,
in
which
she
find
the
Miss
Dashwoods
very
ready
to
resume
their
former
share
.
  
<EOS>
about
the
third
or
fourth
morning
after
their
being
thus
resettle
in
Berkeley
Street
,
Mrs.
Jennings
,
on
return
from
her
ordinary
visit
to
Mrs.
Palmer
,
enter
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
Elinor
be
sit
by
herself
,
with
an
air
of
such
hurrying
importance
as
prepare
her
to
hear
something
wonderful
;
and
give
her
time
only
to
form
that
idea
,
begin
directly
to
justify
it
,
by
say
    
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
my
dear
Miss
Dashwood
!
<EOS>
have
you
hear
the
news
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
madam
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
something
so
strange
!
<EOS>
but
you
shall
hear
it
all
.
<EOS>
when
I
get
to
Mr.
Palmer
's
,
I
find
Charlotte
quite
in
a
fuss
about
the
child
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
it
be
very
ill
 
<EOS>
it
cry
,
and
fret
,
and
be
all
over
pimple
.
<EOS>
so
I
look
at
it
directly
,
and
,
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
it
be
nothing
in
the
world
,
but
the
red
gum
 
"
and
nurse
say
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
but
Charlotte
,
she
would
not
be
satisfied
,
so
Mr.
Donavan
be
send
for
;
and
luckily
he
happen
to
just
come
in
from
Harley
Street
,
so
he
step
over
directly
,
and
as
soon
as
ever
he
see
the
child
,
he
say
just
as
we
do
,
that
it
be
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
red
gum
,
and
then
Charlotte
be
easy
.
<EOS>
and
so
,
just
as
he
be
go
away
again
,
it
come
into
my
head
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
how
I
happen
to
think
of
it
,
but
it
come
into
my
head
to
ask
him
if
there
be
any
news
.
<EOS>
so
upon
that
,
he
smirk
,
and
simper
,
and
look
grave
,
and
seem
to
know
something
or
other
,
and
at
last
he
say
in
a
whisper
,
"
for
fear
any
unpleasant
report
should
reach
the
young
lady
under
your
care
as
to
their
sister
's
indisposition
,
I
think
it
advisable
to
say
,
that
I
believe
there
be
no
great
reason
for
alarm
;
I
hope
Mrs.
Dashwood
will
do
very
well
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
be
Fanny
ill
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
exactly
what
I
say
,
my
dear
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
!
"
say
I
,
"
be
Mrs.
Dashwood
ill
?
"
<EOS>
so
then
it
all
come
out
;
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
the
matter
,
by
all
I
can
learn
,
seem
to
be
this
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Edward
Ferrars
,
the
very
young
man
I
use
to
joke
with
you
about
(
<EOS>
but
however
,
as
it
turn
out
,
I
be
monstrous
glad
there
be
never
any
thing
in
it
)
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Edward
Ferrars
,
it
seem
,
have
be
engage
above
this
twelvemonth
to
my
cousin
Lucy
!
<EOS>
there
be
for
you
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
and
not
a
creature
know
a
syllable
of
the
matter
,
except
Nancy
!
<EOS>
Could
you
have
believe
such
a
thing
possible
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
great
wonder
in
their
like
one
another
;
but
that
matter
should
be
bring
so
forward
between
them
,
and
nobody
suspect
it
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
be
strange
!
<EOS>
I
never
happen
to
see
them
together
,
or
I
be
sure
I
should
have
find
it
out
directly
.
<EOS>
well
,
and
so
this
be
keep
a
great
secret
,
for
fear
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
and
neither
she
nor
your
brother
or
sister
suspect
a
word
of
the
matter
:
till
this
very
morning
,
poor
Nancy
,
who
,
you
know
,
be
a
well
-
mean
creature
,
but
no
conjurer
,
popt
it
all
out
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
!
"
think
she
to
herself
,
"
they
be
all
so
fond
of
Lucy
,
to
be
sure
they
will
make
no
difficulty
about
it
;
"
and
so
,
away
she
go
to
your
sister
,
who
be
sit
all
alone
at
her
carpet
-
work
,
<EOS>
little
suspect
what
be
to
come
 
<EOS>
for
she
have
just
be
say
to
your
brother
,
<EOS>
only
five
minute
before
,
that
she
think
to
make
a
match
between
Edward
and
some
Lord
's
daughter
or
other
<EOS>
,
I
forget
who
.
<EOS>
so
you
may
think
what
a
blow
it
be
to
all
her
vanity
and
pride
.
<EOS>
She
fall
into
violent
hysteric
immediately
,
with
such
scream
as
reach
your
brother
's
ear
,
as
he
be
sit
in
his
own
dressing
-
room
down
stair
,
think
about
write
a
letter
to
his
steward
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
so
up
he
fly
directly
,
and
a
terrible
scene
take
place
,
for
Lucy
be
come
to
them
by
that
time
,
little
dream
what
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
I
pity
_
her
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
and
I
must
say
,
<EOS>
I
think
she
be
use
very
hardly
;
for
your
sister
scold
like
any
fury
,
and
soon
drive
her
into
a
fainting
fit
.
<EOS>
Nancy
,
she
fall
upon
her
knee
,
and
cry
bitterly
;
and
your
brother
,
he
walk
about
the
room
,
and
say
he
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
declare
they
should
not
stay
a
minute
longer
in
the
house
,
and
your
brother
be
force
to
go
down
upon
_
his
_
knee
too
,
to
persuade
her
to
let
them
stay
till
they
have
pack
up
their
clothe
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
then
_
she
fall
into
hysteric
again
,
and
he
be
so
frightened
that
he
would
send
for
Mr.
Donavan
,
and
Mr.
Donavan
find
the
house
in
all
this
uproar
.
<EOS>
the
carriage
be
at
the
door
ready
to
take
my
poor
cousin
away
,
and
they
be
just
step
in
as
he
come
off
;
poor
Lucy
in
such
a
condition
<EOS>
,
he
say
,
she
could
hardly
walk
;
and
Nancy
,
she
be
almost
as
bad
.
<EOS>
I
declare
,
I
have
no
patience
with
your
sister
;
and
I
hope
,
with
all
my
heart
,
it
will
be
a
match
in
spite
of
her
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
a
take
poor
Mr.
Edward
will
be
in
when
he
hear
of
it
!
<EOS>
to
have
his
love
use
so
scornfully
!
<EOS>
for
they
say
he
be
monstrous
fond
of
her
,
as
well
he
may
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
,
if
he
be
to
be
in
the
great
passion
!
 
and
Mr.
Donavan
think
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
have
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
it
;
and
the
good
of
all
be
,
that
he
be
go
back
again
to
Harley
Street
,
that
he
may
be
within
call
when
Mrs.
Ferrars
be
tell
of
it
,
for
she
be
send
for
as
soon
as
ever
my
cousin
leave
the
house
,
<EOS>
for
your
sister
be
sure
_
<EOS>
she
_
would
be
in
hysteric
too
;
and
so
she
may
,
for
what
I
care
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
pity
for
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
notion
of
people
's
make
such
a
to
-
do
about
money
and
greatness
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
on
earth
why
Mr.
Edward
and
Lucy
should
not
marry
;
for
I
be
sure
Mrs.
Ferrars
may
afford
to
do
very
well
by
her
son
,
and
though
Lucy
have
next
to
nothing
herself
,
she
know
well
than
any
body
how
to
make
the
most
of
every
thing
;
I
dare
say
,
if
Mrs.
Ferrars
would
only
allow
him
five
hundred
a
-
year
,
she
would
make
as
good
an
appearance
with
it
as
any
body
else
<EOS>
would
with
eight
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
snug
they
may
live
in
such
another
cottage
as
yours
 
or
a
little
big
 
with
two
maid
,
and
two
man
;
and
I
believe
I
could
help
them
to
a
housemaid
,
for
my
Betty
have
a
sister
out
of
place
,
that
would
fit
them
exactly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
Mrs.
Jennings
cease
,
and
as
Elinor
have
have
time
enough
to
collect
her
thought
,
she
be
able
to
give
such
an
answer
,
and
make
such
observation
,
as
the
subject
may
naturally
be
suppose
to
produce
.
<EOS>
happy
to
find
that
she
be
not
suspect
of
any
extraordinary
interest
in
it
;
that
Mrs.
Jennings
(
as
she
have
of
late
often
hope
may
be
the
case
)
have
cease
to
imagine
her
at
all
attach
to
Edward
;
and
happy
above
all
the
rest
,
in
the
absence
of
Marianne
,
she
feel
very
well
able
to
speak
of
the
affair
without
embarrassment
,
and
to
give
her
judgment
,
as
she
believe
,
with
impartiality
on
the
conduct
of
every
one
concern
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
determine
what
her
own
expectation
of
its
event
really
be
;
though
she
earnestly
try
to
drive
away
the
notion
of
its
be
possible
to
end
otherwise
at
last
,
than
in
the
marriage
of
Edward
and
Lucy
.
<EOS>
what
Mrs.
Ferrars
would
say
and
do
,
though
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
of
its
nature
,
she
be
anxious
to
hear
;
and
still
more
anxious
to
know
how
Edward
would
conduct
himself
.
<EOS>
for
_
him
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
she
feel
much
compassion
;
 
for
Lucy
very
little
 
<EOS>
and
it
cost
her
some
pain
to
procure
that
little
;
 
for
the
rest
of
the
party
none
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Jennings
could
talk
on
no
other
subject
,
Elinor
soon
see
the
necessity
of
prepare
Marianne
for
its
discussion
.
<EOS>
no
time
be
to
be
lose
in
undeceive
her
,
in
make
her
acquaint
with
the
real
truth
,
and
in
endeavour
to
bring
her
to
hear
it
talk
of
by
other
,
without
betray
that
she
feel
any
uneasiness
for
her
sister
,
or
any
resentment
against
Edward
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
's
office
be
a
painful
one
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
remove
what
she
really
believe
to
be
her
sister
's
chief
consolation
,
 
to
give
such
particular
of
Edward
as
she
fear
would
ruin
him
for
ever
in
her
good
opinion,-and
to
make
Marianne
,
by
a
resemblance
in
their
situation
,
which
to
_
her
_
fancy
would
seem
strong
,
feel
all
her
own
disappointment
over
again
.
<EOS>
but
unwelcome
as
such
a
task
must
be
,
it
be
necessary
to
be
do
,
and
Elinor
therefore
hasten
to
perform
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
very
far
from
wish
to
dwell
on
her
own
feeling
,
or
to
represent
herself
as
suffer
much
,
any
otherwise
than
as
the
self
-
command
she
have
practise
since
her
first
knowledge
of
Edward
's
engagement
,
may
suggest
a
hint
of
what
be
practicable
to
Marianne
.
<EOS>
Her
narration
be
clear
and
simple
;
and
though
it
could
not
be
give
without
emotion
,
it
be
not
accompany
by
violent
agitation
,
nor
impetuous
grief
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
belong
rather
to
the
hearer
,
for
Marianne
listen
with
horror
,
and
cry
excessively
.
<EOS>
Elinor
be
to
be
the
comforter
of
other
in
her
own
distress
,
no
less
than
in
theirs
;
and
all
the
comfort
that
could
be
give
by
assurance
of
her
own
composure
of
mind
,
and
a
very
earnest
vindication
of
Edward
from
every
charge
but
of
imprudence
,
be
readily
offer
.
  
<EOS>
but
Marianne
for
some
time
would
give
credit
to
neither
.
<EOS>
Edward
seem
a
second
Willoughby
;
and
acknowledge
as
Elinor
do
,
that
she
_
have
_
love
him
most
sincerely
,
could
she
feel
less
than
herself
!
<EOS>
as
for
Lucy
Steele
,
she
consider
her
so
totally
unamiable
,
so
absolutely
incapable
of
attach
a
sensible
man
,
that
she
could
not
be
persuade
at
first
to
believe
,
and
afterwards
to
pardon
,
any
former
affection
of
Edward
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
even
admit
it
to
have
be
natural
;
and
Elinor
leave
her
to
be
convince
that
it
be
so
,
by
that
which
only
could
convince
her
,
a
well
knowledge
of
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
Her
first
communication
have
reach
no
farther
than
to
state
the
fact
of
the
engagement
,
and
the
length
of
time
it
have
exist
.
<EOS>
Marianne
's
feeling
have
then
break
in
,
and
put
an
end
to
all
regularity
of
detail
;
and
for
some
time
all
that
could
be
do
be
to
soothe
her
distress
,
lessen
her
alarm
,
and
combat
her
resentment
.
<EOS>
the
first
question
on
her
side
,
which
lead
to
farther
particular
,
be
    
"
how
long
have
this
be
know
to
you
,
Elinor
?
<EOS>
have
he
write
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
know
it
these
four
month
.
<EOS>
when
Lucy
first
come
to
Barton
Park
last
November
,
she
tell
me
in
confidence
of
her
engagement
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
,
Marianne
's
eye
express
the
astonishment
which
her
lip
could
not
utter
.
<EOS>
after
a
pause
of
wonder
,
she
exclaim
    
"
four
month
!
 
<EOS>
have
you
know
of
this
four
month
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
confirm
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
 
<EOS>
while
attend
me
in
all
my
misery
,
have
this
be
on
your
heart
?
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
reproach
you
for
be
happy
!
"
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
fit
that
you
should
then
know
how
much
I
be
the
reverse
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
four
month
!
<EOS>
"
cry
Marianne
again
.
"
<EOS>
so
calm
!
<EOS>
so
cheerful
!
<EOS>
how
have
you
be
support
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
by
feel
that
I
be
do
my
duty
.
<EOS>
My
promise
to
Lucy
,
oblige
me
to
be
secret
.
<EOS>
I
owe
it
to
her
,
therefore
,
to
avoid
give
any
hint
of
the
truth
;
and
I
owe
it
to
my
family
and
friend
,
not
to
create
in
them
a
solicitude
about
me
,
which
it
could
not
be
in
my
power
to
satisfy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Marianne
seem
much
strike
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
very
often
wish
to
undeceive
yourself
and
my
mother
,
"
add
Elinor
;
"
and
once
or
twice
I
have
attempt
it
;
but
without
betray
my
trust
,
I
never
could
have
convince
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
four
month
!
<EOS>
and
yet
you
love
him
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
love
only
him
;
 
and
while
the
comfort
of
other
be
dear
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
be
glad
to
spare
them
from
know
how
much
I
feel
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
can
think
and
speak
of
it
with
little
emotion
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
suffer
on
my
account
;
for
I
assure
you
I
no
longer
suffer
materially
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
many
thing
to
support
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
conscious
of
have
provoke
the
disappointment
by
any
imprudence
of
my
own
,
I
have
bear
it
as
much
as
possible
without
spread
it
farther
.
<EOS>
I
acquit
Edward
of
essential
misconduct
.
<EOS>
I
wish
him
very
happy
;
and
I
be
so
sure
of
his
always
do
his
duty
,
that
though
now
he
may
harbour
some
regret
,
in
the
end
he
must
become
so
.
<EOS>
Lucy
do
not
want
sense
,
and
that
be
the
foundation
on
which
every
thing
good
may
be
build
.
<EOS>
and
after
all
,
Marianne
,
after
all
that
be
bewitch
in
the
idea
of
a
single
and
constant
attachment
,
and
all
that
can
be
say
of
one
's
happiness
depend
entirely
on
any
particular
person
,
it
be
not
mean
 
it
be
not
fit
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
possible
that
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
Edward
will
marry
Lucy
;
he
will
marry
a
woman
superior
in
person
and
understanding
to
half
her
sex
;
and
time
and
habit
will
teach
him
to
forget
that
he
ever
think
another
superior
to
_
her
.
<EOS>
_
"
  
"
if
such
be
your
way
of
thinking
,
"
say
Marianne
,
"
if
the
loss
of
what
be
most
value
be
so
easily
to
be
make
up
by
something
else

your
resolution
,
your
self

command
,
be
,
perhaps
,
a
little
less
to
be
wonder
at
.
<EOS>
They
be
bring
more
within
my
comprehension
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
suppose
that
I
have
ever
feel
much
.
<EOS>
for
four
month
,
Marianne
,
I
have
have
all
this
hang
on
my
mind
,
without
be
at
liberty
to
speak
of
it
to
a
single
creature
;
know
that
it
would
make
you
and
my
mother
most
unhappy
whenever
it
be
explain
to
you
,
yet
unable
to
prepare
you
for
it
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
It
be
tell
me
,
 
it
be
in
a
manner
force
on
me
by
the
very
person
herself
,
whose
prior
engagement
ruin
all
my
prospect
;
and
tell
me
,
as
I
think
,
with
triumph
.
<EOS>
this
person
's
suspicion
,
therefore
,
I
have
have
to
oppose
,
by
endeavour
to
appear
indifferent
where
I
have
be
most
deeply
interested
;
 
and
it
have
not
be
only
once
;
 
<EOS>
I
have
have
her
hope
and
exultation
to
listen
to
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
myself
to
be
divide
from
Edward
for
ever
,
without
hear
one
circumstance
that
could
make
me
less
desire
the
connection
.
<EOS>
nothing
have
prove
him
unworthy
;
nor
have
anything
declare
him
indifferent
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
to
contend
against
the
unkindness
of
his
sister
,
and
the
insolence
of
his
mother
;
and
have
suffer
the
punishment
of
an
attachment
,
without
enjoy
its
advantage
.
<EOS>
and
all
this
have
be
go
on
at
a
time
,
when
,
as
you
know
too
well
,
it
have
not
be
my
only
unhappiness
.
<EOS>
if
you
can
think
me
capable
of
ever
feel
,
surely
you
may
suppose
that
I
have
suffer
_
now
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
the
composure
of
mind
with
which
I
have
bring
myself
at
present
to
consider
the
matter
,
the
consolation
that
I
have
be
willing
to
admit
,
have
be
the
effect
of
constant
and
painful
exertion
;
they
do
not
spring
up
of
themselves

they
do
not
occur
to
relieve
my
spirit
at
first

<EOS>
no

Marianne

_
<EOS>
then
_
,
if
I
have
not

bind
to
silence

perhaps
nothing
could
have
keep
me
entirely
 
not

what
I
owe
to
my

me
!
<EOS>
be
this
my
gratitude
?
<EOS>
be
this
the
only
return
I
can
make
you
?
<EOS>
because
your
merit
cry
out
upon
myself
,
I
have
be
try
to
do
it
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
tender
caress
follow
this
confession
.
<EOS>
in
such
a
frame
of
mind
as
she
be
now
in
,
Elinor
have
no
difficulty
in
obtain
from
her
whatever
promise
she
require
;
and
at
her
request
,
Marianne
engage
never
to
speak
of
the
affair
to
any
one
with
the
least
appearance
of
bitterness
;
 
to
meet
Lucy
without
betray
the
small
increase
of
dislike
to
her
;
 
and
even
to
see
Edward
himself
,
if
chance
should
bring
them
together
,
without
any
diminution
of
her
usual
cordiality
.
<EOS>
these
be
great
concession
;
 
but
where
Marianne
feel
that
she
have
injure
,
no
reparation
could
be
too
much
for
her
to
make
.
  
<EOS>
She
perform
her
promise
of
be
discreet
,
to
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
attend
to
all
that
Mrs.
Jennings
have
to
say
upon
the
subject
,
with
an
unchanging
complexion
,
dissent
from
her
in
nothing
,
and
be
hear
three
time
to
say
,
"
yes
,
madam
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
listen
to
her
praise
of
Lucy
with
only
move
from
one
chair
to
another
,
and
when
Mrs.
Jennings
talk
of
Edward
's
affection
,
it
cost
her
only
a
spasm
in
her
throat
.
<EOS>
such
advance
towards
heroism
in
her
sister
,
make
Elinor
feel
equal
to
any
thing
herself
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
bring
a
farth
trial
of
it
,
in
a
visit
from
their
brother
,
who
come
with
a
most
serious
aspect
to
talk
over
the
dreadful
affair
,
and
bring
them
news
of
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
hear
,
I
suppose
,
"
say
he
with
great
solemnity
,
as
soon
as
he
be
seat
,
"
of
the
very
shocking
discovery
that
take
place
under
our
roof
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
all
look
their
assent
;
it
seem
too
awful
a
moment
for
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
,
"
he
continue
,
"
have
suffer
dreadfully
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ferrars
too
 
in
short
<EOS>
it
have
be
a
scene
of
such
complicated
distress
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
hope
that
the
storm
may
be
weather
without
our
be
any
of
us
quite
overcome
.
<EOS>
Poor
Fanny
!
<EOS>
she
be
in
hysteric
all
yesterday
.
<EOS>
but
I
would
not
alarm
you
too
much
.
<EOS>
Donavan
say
there
be
nothing
materially
to
be
apprehend
;
her
constitution
be
a
good
one
,
and
her
resolution
equal
to
any
thing
.
<EOS>
She
have
bear
it
all
,
with
the
fortitude
of
an
angel
!
<EOS>
She
say
she
never
shall
think
well
of
anybody
again
;
and
one
can
not
wonder
at
it
,
after
be
so
deceive
!
 
<EOS>
meeting
with
such
ingratitude
,
where
so
much
kindness
have
be
show
,
so
much
confidence
have
be
place
!
<EOS>
It
be
quite
out
of
the
benevolence
of
her
heart
,
that
she
have
ask
these
young
woman
to
her
house
;
merely
because
she
think
they
deserve
some
attention
,
be
harmless
,
well
-
behave
girl
,
and
would
be
pleasant
companion
;
for
otherwise
we
both
wish
very
much
to
have
invite
you
and
Marianne
to
be
with
us
,
while
your
kind
friend
there
,
be
attend
her
daughter

and
now
to
be
so
reward
!
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
with
all
my
heart

"
say
poor
Fanny
in
her
affectionate
way
,

that
we
have
ask
your
sister
instead
of
them
.

<EOS>
"
  
here
he
stop
to
be
thank
;
which
be
do
,
he
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
poor
Mrs.
Ferrars
suffer
,
when
first
Fanny
break
it
to
her
,
be
not
to
be
describe
.
<EOS>
while
she
with
the
true
affection
have
be
plan
a
most
eligible
connection
for
him
,
be
it
to
be
suppose
that
he
could
be
all
the
time
secretly
engage
to
another
person
!
 
<EOS>
such
a
suspicion
could
never
have
enter
her
head
!
<EOS>
if
she
suspect
_
any
_
prepossession
elsewhere
,
it
could
not
be
in
_
that

quarter
.
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
there

to
be
sure

say
she
,
"
I
may
have
think
myself
safe

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
be
quite
in
an
agony
.
<EOS>
We
consult
together
,
however
,
as
to
what
should
be
do
,
and
at
last
she
determine
to
send
for
Edward
.
<EOS>
He
come
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
sorry
to
relate
what
ensue
.
<EOS>
all
that
Mrs.
Ferrars
could
say
to
make
him
put
an
end
to
the
engagement
,
assist
too
as
you
may
well
suppose
by
my
argument
,
and
Fanny
's
entreaty
,
be
of
no

<EOS>
duty
,
affection
,
every
thing
be
disregard
.
<EOS>
I
never
think
Edward
so
stubborn
,
so
unfeele
before
.
<EOS>
His
mother
explain
to
him
her
liberal
design
,
in
case
of
his
marrying
Miss
Morton
;
tell
him
she
would
settle
on
him
the
Norfolk
estate
,
which
,
clear
of
land
-
tax
,
bring
in
a
good
thousand
a
-
year
;
offer
even
,
when
matter
grow
desperate
,
to
make
it
twelve
hundred
;
and
in
opposition
to
this
,
if
he
still
persist
in
this
low
connection
,
represent
to
him
the
certain
penury
that
must
attend
the
match
.
<EOS>
His
own
two
thousand
pound
she
protest
should
be
his
all
<EOS>
;
she
would
never
see
him
again
;
and
so
far
would
she
be
from
afford
him
the
small
assistance
,
that
if
he
be
to
enter
into
any
profession
with
a
view
of
well
support
,
she
would
do
all
in
her
power
to
prevent
him
advance
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Marianne
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
indignation
,
clap
her
hand
together
,
and
cry
,
"
Gracious
God
!
<EOS>
can
this
be
possible
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
may
you
wonder
,
Marianne
,
"
reply
her
brother
,
"
at
the
obstinacy
which
could
resist
such
argument
as
these
.
<EOS>
Your
exclamation
be
very
natural
.
"
  
<EOS>
Marianne
be
go
to
retort
,
but
she
remember
her
promise
,
and
forbore
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
this
,
however
,
"
he
continue
,
"
be
urge
in
vain

<EOS>
Edward
say
very
little
;
but
what
he
do
say
,
be
in
the
most
determined
manner
.
<EOS>
nothing
should
prevail
on
him
to
give
up
his
engagement
.
<EOS>
He
would
stand
to
it
,
cost
him
what
it
may
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Jennings
with
blunt
sincerity
,
no
longer
able
to
be
silent
,
"
he
have
act
like
an
honest
man
!
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Dashwood
,
but
if
he
have
do
otherwise
,
I
should
have
think
him
a
rascal
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
little
concern
in
the
business
,
as
well
as
yourself
,
for
Lucy
Steele
be
my
cousin
,
and
I
believe
there
be
not
a
well
kind
of
girl
in
the
world
,
nor
one
who
more
deserve
a
good
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
Dashwood
be
greatly
astonished
;
but
his
nature
be
calm
,
not
open
to
provocation
,
and
he
never
wish
to
offend
anybody
,
especially
anybody
of
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
reply
,
without
any
resentment
    
<EOS>
"
I
would
by
no
mean
speak
disrespectfully
of
any
relation
of
yours
,
madam

<EOS>
Miss
Lucy
Steele
be
,
I
dare
say
,
a
very
deserving
young
woman
,
but
in
the
present
case
you
know
,
the
connection
must
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
and
to
have
enter
into
a
secret
engagement
with
a
young
man
under
her
uncle
's
care
,
the
son
of
a
woman
especially
of
such
very
large
fortune
as
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
be
perhaps
,
altogether
a
little
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
do
not
mean
to
reflect
upon
the
behaviour
of
any
person
whom
you
have
a
regard
for
,
Mrs.
Jennings
.
<EOS>
We
all
wish
her
extremely
happy
;
and
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
conduct
throughout
the
whole
,
have
be
such
as
every
conscientious
,
good
mother
,
in
like
circumstance
,
would
adopt
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
dignified
and
liberal
.
<EOS>
Edward
have
draw
his
own
lot
,
and
I
fear
it
will
be
a
bad
one
.

<EOS>
Marianne
sigh
out
her
similar
apprehension
;
and
Elinor
's
heart
wrung
for
the
feeling
of
Edward
,
while
brave
his
mother
's
threat
,
for
a
woman
who
could
not
reward
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir

Mrs.
Jennings
,
"
and
how
do
it
end
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to

,
madam

in

most
unhappy
rupture

Edward

dismiss
for

house
yesterday

where
he
be
go

whether
he
be
still
in
town

I
do

of
course
can
make
no
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
young
man

what
be
to
become
of
him

<EOS>

what
,
indeed
,
madam

<EOS>
It
be
a
melancholy
consideration
.
<EOS>
bear
to
the
prospect
of
such
affluence
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
a
situation
more
deplorable
.
<EOS>
the
interest
of
two
thousand
pound
 
how
can
a
man
live
on
it
?
 
<EOS>
and
when
to
that
be
add
the
recollection
,
that
he
may
,
but
for
his
own
folly
,
within
three
month
have
be
in
the
receipt
of
two
thousand

five
hundred
a

year

for
Miss
Morton
have
thirty
thousand
pound
,
)
<EOS>
I
can
not
picture
to
myself
a
more
wretched
condition
.
<EOS>
We
must
all
feel
for
him
;
and
the
more
so
,
because
it
be
totally
out
of
our
power
to
assist
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
young
man

cry
Mrs.
Jennings
,
"
I
be
sure
he
should
be
very
welcome
to
bed
and
board
at
my
house
;
and
so
I
would
tell
him
if
I
could
see
him
.

It
be
not
fit
that

should
be
live
about
at

at

<EOS>
Elinor
's
heart
thank
her
for
such
kindness
towards
Edward

though
she
could
not
forbear
smile
at
the
form
of
it

<EOS>
"
if
he
would
only
have
do
as
well
by
himself

John
Dashwood

as
all
his

dispose
to
do

he
may

have
be
in

as
it
be

it
must
be
out

power

there
be
one
thing
more
prepare
against

which
must
be
bad

all
 
his

a

minute
more
spend

conclude
his
visit
;
and
with
repeat
assurance
to
his
sister
that
he
really
believe
there
be
no
material
danger
in
Fanny
's
indisposition
,
and
that
they
need
not
therefore
be
very
uneasy
about
it

he
go
away
;
leave
the
three
lady
unanimous
in
their
sentiment
on
the
present
occasion
,
as
far
at
least
as
it
regard
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
conduct
,
the
Dashwoods
'
,
and
Edward
's
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
's
indignation
burst
forth
as
soon
as
he
quit
the
room
;
and
as
her
vehemence
make
reserve
impossible
in
Elinor
,
and
unnecessary
in
Mrs.
Jennings
,
they
all
join
in
a
very
spirited
critique
upon
the
party
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
be
very
warm
in
her
praise
of
Edward
's
conduct
,
but
only
Elinor
and
Marianne
understand
its
true
merit
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
They
_
only
know
how
little
he
have
have
to
tempt
him
to
be
disobedient
,
and
how
small
be
the
consolation
,
beyond
the
consciousness
of
do
right
<EOS>
,
that
could
remain
to
him
in
the
loss
of
friend
and
fortune
.
<EOS>
Elinor
glory
in
his
integrity
;
and
Marianne
forgive
all
his
offence
in
compassion
for
his
punishment
.
<EOS>
but
though
confidence
between
them
be
,
by
this
public
discovery
,
restore
to
its
proper
state
,
it
be
not
a
subject
on
which
either
of
them
be
fond
of
dwelling
when
alone
.
<EOS>
Elinor
avoid
it
upon
principle
,
as
tend
to
fix
still
more
upon
her
thought
,
by
the
too
warm
,
too
positive
assurance
of
Marianne
,
that
belief
of
Edward
's
continued
affection
for
herself
which
she
rather
wish
to
do
away
;
and
Marianne
's
courage
soon
fail
her
,
in
try
to
converse
upon
a
topic
which
always
leave
her
more
dissatisfied
with
herself
than
ever
,
by
the
comparison
it
necessarily
produce
between
Elinor
's
conduct
and
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
She
feel
all
the
force
of
that
comparison
;
but
not
as
her
sister
have
hope
,
to
urge
her
to
exertion
now
;
she
feel
it
with
all
the
pain
of
continual
self
-
reproach
,
regret
most
bitterly
that
she
have
never
exert
herself
before
;
but
it
bring
only
the
torture
of
penitence
,
without
the
hope
of
amendment
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
so
much
weaken
that
she
still
fancy
present
exertion
impossible
,
and
therefore
it
only
dispirit
her
more
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
new
be
hear
by
them
,
for
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
of
affair
in
Harley
Street
,
or
Bartlett
's
Buildings
.
<EOS>
but
though
so
much
of
the
matter
be
know
to
them
already
,
that
Mrs.
Jennings
may
have
have
enough
to
do
in
spread
that
knowledge
farther
,
without
seek
after
more
,
she
have
resolve
from
the
first
to
pay
a
visit
of
comfort
and
inquiry
to
her
cousin
as
soon
as
she
could
;
and
nothing
but
the
hindrance
of
more
visitor
than
usual
,
have
prevent
her
go
to
them
within
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
day
succeed
their
knowledge
of
the
particular
,
be
so
fine
,
so
beautiful
a
Sunday
as
to
draw
many
to
Kensington
Gardens
,
though
it
be
only
the
second
week
in
March
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
and
Elinor
be
of
the
number
;
but
Marianne
,
who
know
that
the
Willoughbys
be
again
in
town
,
and
have
a
constant
dread
of
meet
them
,
choose
rather
to
stay
at
home
,
than
venture
into
so
public
a
place
.
  
<EOS>
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Jennings
join
them
soon
after
they
enter
the
Gardens
,
and
Elinor
be
not
sorry
that
by
her
continue
with
them
,
and
engage
all
Mrs.
Jennings
's
conversation
,
she
be
herself
leave
to
quiet
reflection
.
<EOS>
She
see
nothing
of
the
Willoughbys
,
nothing
of
Edward
,
and
for
some
time
nothing
of
anybody
who
could
by
any
chance
whether
grave
or
gay
,
be
interesting
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
she
find
herself
with
some
surprise
,
accost
by
Miss
Steele
,
who
,
though
look
rather
shy
,
express
great
satisfaction
in
meet
them
,
and
on
receive
encouragement
from
the
particular
kindness
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
leave
her
own
party
for
a
short
time
,
to
join
their
's
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
immediately
whisper
to
Elinor
    
<EOS>
"
get
it
all
out
of
her
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
She
will
tell
you
any
thing
if
you
ask
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
can
not
leave
Mrs.
Clarke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
lucky
,
however
,
for
Mrs.
Jennings
's
curiosity
and
Elinor
be
too
,
that
she
would
tell
any
thing
_
without
_
be
ask
;
for
nothing
would
otherwise
have
be
learn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
to
meet
you
;
"
say
Miss
Steele
,
take
her
familiarly
by
the
arm
 
"
for
I
want
to
see
you
of
all
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
lower
her
voice
,
"
I
suppose
Mrs.
Jennings
have
hear
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
be
she
angry
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
at
all
,
I
believe
,
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
good
thing
.
<EOS>
and
Lady
Middleton
,
be
_
<EOS>
she
<EOS>
_
angry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
suppose
it
possible
that
she
should
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
monstrous
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
good
gracious
!
<EOS>
I
have
have
such
a
time
of
it
!
<EOS>
I
never
see
Lucy
in
such
a
rage
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
She
vow
at
first
she
would
never
trim
me
up
a
new
bonnet
,
nor
do
any
thing
else
for
me
again
,
so
long
as
she
live
;
but
now
she
be
quite
come
to
,
and
we
be
as
good
friend
as
ever
.
<EOS>
look
,
she
make
me
this
bow
to
my
hat
,
and
put
in
the
feather
last
night
.
<EOS>
there
now
,
_
you
_
be
go
to
laugh
at
me
too
.
<EOS>
but
why
should
not
I
wear
pink
ribbon
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
if
it
_
be
_
the
Doctor
's
favourite
colour
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
for
my
part
,
I
should
never
have
know
he
<EOS>
_
do
_
like
it
better
than
any
other
colour
,
if
he
have
not
happen
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
have
be
so
plague
me
!
<EOS>
I
declare
sometimes
I
do
not
know
which
way
to
look
before
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
wander
away
to
a
subject
on
which
Elinor
have
nothing
to
say
,
and
therefore
soon
judge
it
expedient
to
find
her
way
back
again
to
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
Miss
Dashwood
,
"
speak
triumphantly
<EOS>
,
"
people
may
say
what
they
choose
about
Mr.
Ferrars
's
declaring
he
would
not
have
Lucy
,
for
it
be
no
such
thing
I
can
tell
you
;
and
it
be
quite
a
shame
for
such
ill
-
natured
report
to
be
spread
abroad
.
<EOS>
whatever
Lucy
may
think
about
it
herself
,
you
know
,
it
be
no
business
of
other
people
to
set
it
down
for
certain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
any
thing
of
the
kind
hint
at
before
,
I
assure
you
,
"
say
Elinor
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
not
you
?
<EOS>
but
it
_
be
<EOS>
_
say
,
I
know
,
very
well
,
and
by
more
than
one
;
for
Miss
Godby
tell
Miss
Sparks
,
that
nobody
in
their
sense
could
expect
Mr.
Ferrars
to
give
up
a
woman
like
Miss
Morton
,
with
thirty
thousand
pound
to
her
fortune
,
for
Lucy
Steele
that
have
nothing
at
all
;
and
I
have
it
from
Miss
spark
myself
.
<EOS>
and
besides
that
,
my
cousin
Richard
say
himself
,
that
when
it
come
to
the
point
he
be
afraid
Mr.
Ferrars
would
be
off
;
and
when
Edward
do
not
come
near
us
for
three
day
,
I
could
not
tell
what
to
think
myself
;
and
I
believe
in
my
heart
Lucy
give
it
up
all
for
lose
;
for
we
come
away
from
your
brother
's
Wednesday
,
and
we
see
nothing
of
him
not
all
Thursday
,
Friday
,
and
Saturday
,
and
do
not
know
what
be
become
of
him
.
<EOS>
once
Lucy
think
to
write
to
him
,
but
then
her
spirit
rise
against
that
.
<EOS>
however
this
morning
he
come
just
as
we
come
home
from
church
;
and
then
it
all
come
out
,
how
he
have
be
send
for
Wednesday
to
Harley
Street
,
and
be
talk
to
by
his
mother
and
all
of
them
,
and
how
he
have
declare
before
them
all
that
he
love
nobody
but
Lucy
,
and
nobody
but
Lucy
would
he
have
.
<EOS>
and
how
he
have
be
so
worried
by
what
pass
,
that
as
soon
as
he
have
go
away
from
his
mother
's
house
,
he
have
get
upon
his
horse
,
and
rid
into
the
country
,
some
where
or
other
;
and
how
he
have
stay
about
at
an
inn
all
Thursday
and
Friday
,
on
purpose
to
get
the
well
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
after
think
it
all
over
and
over
again
,
he
say
,
it
seem
to
him
as
if
,
now
he
have
no
fortune
,
and
no
nothing
at
all
,
it
would
be
quite
unkind
to
keep
her
on
to
the
engagement
,
because
it
must
be
for
her
loss
,
for
he
have
nothing
but
two
thousand
pound
,
and
no
hope
of
any
thing
else
;
and
if
he
be
to
go
into
order
,
as
he
have
some
thought
,
he
could
get
nothing
but
a
curacy
,
and
how
be
they
to
live
upon
that
?
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
think
of
her
do
no
better
,
and
so
he
beg
,
if
she
have
the
least
mind
for
it
,
to
put
an
end
to
the
matter
directly
,
and
leave
him
shift
for
himself
.
<EOS>
I
hear
him
say
all
this
as
plain
as
could
possibly
be
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
entirely
for
_
her
_
sake
,
and
upon
_
her
_
account
,
that
he
say
a
word
about
be
off
,
and
not
upon
his
own
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
my
oath
<EOS>
he
never
dropt
a
syllable
of
be
tired
of
her
,
or
of
wish
to
marry
Miss
Morton
,
or
any
thing
like
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
to
be
sure
,
Lucy
would
not
give
ear
to
such
kind
of
talking
;
so
she
tell
him
directly
(
with
a
great
deal
about
sweet
and
love
,
you
know
,
and
all
that
 
<EOS>
oh
,
la
!
one
can
not
repeat
such
kind
of
thing
you
know
)
 
<EOS>
she
tell
him
directly
,
she
have
not
the
least
mind
in
the
world
to
be
off
,
for
she
could
live
with
him
upon
a
trifle
,
and
how
little
<EOS>
so
ever
he
may
have
,
she
should
be
very
glad
to
have
it
all
,
you
know
,
or
something
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
so
then
he
be
monstrous
happy
,
and
talk
on
some
time
about
what
they
should
do
,
and
they
agree
he
should
take
order
directly
,
and
they
must
wait
to
be
married
till
he
get
a
living
.
<EOS>
and
just
then
I
could
not
hear
any
more
,
for
my
cousin
call
from
below
to
tell
me
Mrs.
Richardson
be
come
in
her
coach
,
and
would
take
one
of
us
to
Kensington
Gardens
;
so
I
be
force
to
go
into
the
room
and
interrupt
them
,
to
ask
Lucy
if
she
would
like
to
go
,
but
she
do
not
care
to
leave
Edward
;
so
I
just
run
up
stair
and
put
on
a
pair
of
silk
stocking
and
come
off
with
the
richardson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
interrupt
them
,
"
say
Elinor
;
"
you
be
all
in
the
same
room
together
,
be
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
not
us
.
<EOS>
La
!
<EOS>
Miss
Dashwood
,
do
you
think
people
make
love
when
any
body
else
be
by
?
<EOS>
oh
,
for
shame
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
you
must
know
better
than
that
.
<EOS>
(
laugh
affectedly
.
)
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
;
they
be
shut
up
in
the
drawing
-
room
together
,
and
all
I
hear
be
only
by
listen
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
cry
Elinor
;
"
have
you
be
repeat
to
me
what
you
only
learn
yourself
by
listen
at
the
door
?
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
I
do
not
know
it
before
;
for
I
certainly
would
not
have
suffer
you
to
give
me
particular
of
a
conversation
which
you
ought
not
to
have
know
yourself
.
<EOS>
how
could
you
behave
so
unfairly
by
your
sister
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
la
!
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
_
that
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
only
stand
at
the
door
,
and
hear
what
I
could
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
Lucy
would
have
do
just
the
same
by
me
;
for
a
year
or
two
back
,
when
Martha
Sharpe
and
I
have
so
many
secret
together
,
she
never
make
any
bone
of
hiding
in
a
closet
,
or
behind
a
chimney
-
board
,
on
purpose
to
hear
what
we
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
Elinor
try
to
talk
of
something
else
;
but
Miss
Steele
could
not
be
keep
beyond
a
couple
of
minute
,
from
what
be
uppermost
in
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Edward
talk
of
go
to
Oxford
soon
,
"
say
she
;
"
but
now
he
be
lodge
at
no
.
,
Pall
Mall
.
<EOS>
what
an
ill
-
natured
woman
his
mother
be
,
an't
she
?
<EOS>
and
your
brother
and
sister
be
not
very
kind
!
<EOS>
however
,
I
shall
not
say
anything
against
them
to
_
<EOS>
you
_
;
and
<EOS>
to
be
sure
they
do
send
us
home
in
their
own
chariot
,
which
be
more
than
I
look
for
.
<EOS>
and
for
my
part
,
I
be
all
in
a
fright
for
fear
your
sister
should
ask
us
for
the
huswife
she
have
give
us
a
day
or
two
before
;
but
,
however
,
nothing
be
say
about
them
,
and
I
take
care
to
keep
mine
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
Edward
have
get
some
business
at
Oxford
,
he
say
;
so
he
must
go
there
for
a
time
;
and
after
_
that
_
,
as
soon
as
he
can
light
upon
a
Bishop
,
he
will
be
ordain
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
curacy
he
will
get
!
<EOS>
good
gracious
!
<EOS>
(
giggle
as

<EOS>
I
would
lay
my
life
<EOS>
I
know
what
my
cousin
will
say
,
when
they
hear
of
it

<EOS>
They
will
tell
me
I
should
write
to
the
Doctor
,
to
get
Edward
the
curacy
of
his
new
living
.
<EOS>
I
know
they
will
;
but
I
be
sure
I
would
not
do
such
a
thing
for
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
La
!
<EOS>
"
I
shall
say
directly
,
"
I
wonder
how
you
could
think
of
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
I
write
to
the
Doctor
,
indeed
!

<EOS>
"
  
"
well
,
"
say
Elinor
,
"
it
be
a
comfort
to
be
prepare
against
the
bad
.

You
have
get
your
answer
ready
.

"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Steele
be
go
to
reply
on
the
same
subject
,
but
the
approach
of
her
own
party
make
another
more
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
la
!
<EOS>
here
come
the
Richardsons
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
vast
deal
more
to
say
to
you
,
but
I
must
not
stay
away
from
them
not
any
longer
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
they
be
very
genteel
people

He
make
a
monstrous
deal
of
money
,
and
they
keep
their
own
coach
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
time
to
speak
to
Mrs.
Jennings
about
it
myself
,
but
pray
tell
her
I
be
quite
happy
to
hear
she
be
not
in
anger
against
us
,
and
Lady
Middleton
the

and
if
anything
should
happen
to
take
you

your

away

should
want
company
,
I
be

we
should
be
very
glad
to
come
and
stay
with
her
for
as
long
a
time
as
she
like

I
suppose
Lady
Middleton
will
not
ask
us
any
more
this
bout

good

not
afraid
of
its

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
such
be
her
parting
concern
;
for
after
this
,
she
have
time
only
to
pay
her
farewell
compliment
to
Mrs.
Jennings
,
before
her
company
be
claim
by
Mrs.
Richardson
;
and
Elinor
be
leave
in
possession
of
knowledge
which
may
feed
her
power
of
reflection
some
time
,
though
she
have
learn
very
little
more

the
carriage
,
Mrs.
Jennings
be
eager
for
information
;
but
as
Elinor
wish
to
spread
as
little
as
possible
intelligence
that
have
in
the
first
place
be
so
unfairly
obtain
,
she
confine
herself
to
the
brief
repetition
of
such
simple
particular
,
as
she
feel
assure
that
Lucy
,
for
the
sake
of
her
own
consequence
,
would
choose
to
have
know
.
<EOS>
the
continuance
of
their
engagement
,
and
the
mean
that
be
able
to
be
take
for
promote
its
end
,
be
all
her
communication
;
and
this
produce
from
Mrs.
Jennings
the
follow
natural
remark
:
    
"
wait
for
his
have
a
living
!
 
<EOS>
ay
,
we
all
know
how
_
<EOS>
that
_
will
end
:
 
they
will
wait
a
twelvemonth
,
and
find
no
good
come
of
it
,
will
set
down
upon
a
curacy
of
fifty
pound
a
-
year
,
with
the
interest
of
his
two
thousand
pound
,
and
what
little
matter
Mr.
Steele
and
Mr.
Pratt
can
give
her
.
<EOS>
then
they
will
have
a
child
every
year
!
<EOS>
and
Lord
help
'em
!
<EOS>
how
poor
they
will
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
see
what
I
can
give
them
towards
furnish
their
house
.
<EOS>
two
maid
and
two
man
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
as
I
talk
of
t'other
day
.
<EOS>
no

no
,
they
must
get
a
stout
girl
of
all
work

<EOS>
Betty

sister
would
never
do
for
them
_
now

<EOS>
"
  
the
next
morning
bring
Elinor
a
letter
by
the
two

penny
post
from
Lucy

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
"
I
hope
my
dear
Miss
Dashwood
will
excuse
the
liberty
I
take
of
write
to
her
;
but
I
know
your
friendship
for
me
will
make
you
pleased
to
hear
such
a
good
account
of
myself
and
my
dear
Edward
,
after
all
the
trouble
we
have
go
through
lately
,
therefore
will
make
no
more
apology
,
but
proceed
to
say
that
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
though
we
have
suffer
dreadfully
,
we
be
both
quite
well
now
,
and
as
happy
as
we
must
always
be
in
one
another
's
love
.
<EOS>
We
have
have
great
trial
,
and
great
persecution
,
but
however
,
at
the
same
time
,
gratefully
acknowledge
many
friend
,
yourself
not
the
least
among
them
,
whose
great
kindness
I
shall
always
thankfully
remember
,
as
will
Edward
too
,
who
I
have
tell
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
,
as
likewise
dear
Mrs.
Jennings
,
I
spend
two
happy
hour
with
him
yesterday
afternoon
,
he
would
not
hear
of
our
parting
,
though
earnestly
do
I
,
as
I
think
my
duty
require
,
urge
him
to
it
for
prudence
sake
,
and
would
have
part
for
ever
on
the
spot
,
would
he
consent
to
it
;
but
he
say
it
should
never
be
,
he
do
not
regard
his
mother
's
anger
,
while
he
could
have
my
affection
;
our
prospect
be
not
very
bright
,
to
be
sure
,
but
we
must
wait
,
and
hope
for
the
good
;
he
will
be
ordain
shortly
;
and
should
it
ever
be
in
your
power
to
recommend
him
to
any
body
that
have
a
living
to
bestow
,
be
very
sure
you
will
not
forget
us
,
and
dear
Mrs.
Jennings
too
,
trust
she
will
speak
a
good
word
for
us
to
Sir
John
,
or
Mr.
Palmer
,
or
any
friend
that
may
be
able
to
assist
us
.
<EOS>
poor
Anne
be
much
to
blame
for
what
she
do
,
but
she
do
it
for
the
good
,
so
I
say
nothing
;
hope
Mrs.
Jennings
will
not
think
it
too
much
trouble
to
give
us
a
call
,
should
she
come
this
way
any
morning
,
'
twould
be
a
great
kindness

my
cousin
would
be
proud
to
know
her

me
to
conclude

beg
to
be
most
gratefully

respectfully
remember
to
her

as
soon
as
Elinor

she
perform
what
she
conclude
to
be
its
writer
's
real
design
,
by
place
it
in
the
hand
of
Mrs.

who
read
it
aloud
with
many
comment
of
satisfaction

praise

"
very
well

how
prettily

great
credit

"
    
<EOS>
the
Miss
Dashwoods
have
now
be
rather
more
than
two
month
in
town
,
and
Marianne
's
impatience
to
be
go
increase
every
day
.
<EOS>
She
sigh
for
the
air
,
the
liberty
,
the
quiet
of
the
country
;
and
fancy
that
if
any
place
could
give
her
ease
,
Barton
must
do
it
.
<EOS>
Elinor
be
hardly
less
anxious
than
herself
for
their
removal
,
and
only
so
much
less
bent
on
its
be
effect
immediately
,
as
that
she
be
conscious
of
the
difficulty
of
so
long
a
journey
,
which
Marianne
could
not
be
bring
to
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
She
begin
,
however
,
seriously
to
turn
her
thought
towards
its
accomplishment
,
and
have
already
mention
their
wish
to
their
kind
hostess
,
who
resist
them
with
all
the
eloquence
of
her
good
-
will
,
when
a
plan
be
suggest
,
which
,
though
detain
them
from
home
yet
a
few
week
longer
,
appear
to
Elinor
altogether
much
more
eligible
than
any
other
.
<EOS>
the
Palmers
be
to
remove
to
Cleveland
about
the
end
of
March
,
for
the
Easter
holiday
;
and
Mrs.
Jennings
,
with
both
her
friend
,
receive
a
very
warm
invitation
from
Charlotte
to
go
with
them
.
<EOS>
this
would
not
,
in
itself
,
have
be
sufficient
for
the
delicacy
of
Miss
Dashwood
;
 
but
it
be
enforce
with
so
much
real
politeness
by
Mr.
Palmer
himself
,
as
,
join
to
the
very
great
amendment
of
his
manner
towards
them
since
her
sister
have
be
know
to
be
unhappy
,
induce
her
to
accept
it
with
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
tell
Marianne
what
she
have
do
,
however
,
her
first
reply
be
not
very
auspicious
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cleveland
!
"
 
<EOS>
she
cry
,
with
great
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
I
can
not
go
to
Cleveland
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
You
forget
,
"
say
Elinor
gently
,
"
that
its
situation
be
not
 
that
it
be
not
in
the
neighbourhood
of
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
it
be
in
Somersetshire
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
go
into
Somersetshire
.
<EOS>
there
,
where
I
look
forward
to
go
;
 
no
,
Elinor
<EOS>
,
you
can
not
expect
me
to
go
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
would
not
argue
upon
the
propriety
of
overcome
such
feeling
;
 
she
only
endeavour
to
counteract
them
by
work
on
other
;
 
represent
it
,
therefore
,
as
a
measure
which
would
fix
the
time
of
her
return
to
that
dear
mother
,
whom
she
so
much
wish
to
see
,
in
a
more
eligible
,
more
comfortable
manner
,
than
any
other
plan
could
do
,
and
perhaps
without
any
great
delay
.
<EOS>
from
Cleveland
,
which
be
within
a
few
mile
of
Bristol
,
the
distance
to
Barton
be
not
beyond
one
day
,
though
a
long
day
's
journey
;
and
their
mother
's
servant
may
easily
come
there
to
attend
them
down
;
and
as
there
could
be
no
occasion
of
their
staying
above
a
week
at
Cleveland
,
they
may
now
be
at
home
in
little
more
than
three
week
'
time
.
<EOS>
as
Marianne
's
affection
for
her
mother
be
sincere
,
it
must
triumph
with
little
difficulty
,
over
the
imaginary
evil
she
have
start
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
be
so
far
from
be
weary
of
her
guest
,
that
she
press
them
very
earnestly
to
return
with
her
again
from
Cleveland
.
<EOS>
Elinor
be
grateful
for
the
attention
,
but
it
could
not
alter
her
design
;
and
their
mother
's
concurrence
be
readily
gain
,
every
thing
relative
to
their
return
be
arrange
as
far
as
it
could
be
;
 
and
Marianne
find
some
relief
in
draw
up
a
statement
of
the
hour
that
be
yet
to
divide
her
from
Barton
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
Colonel
,
I
do
not
know
what
you
and
I
shall
do
without
the
Miss
Dashwoods
;
"
 
be
Mrs.
Jennings
's
address
to
him
when
he
first
call
on
her
,
after
their
leave
her
be
settle
 
"
for
they
be
quite
resolve
upon
go
home
from
the
Palmers
;
 
and
<EOS>
how
forlorn
we
shall
be
,
when
I
come
back
!
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
we
shall
sit
and
gape
at
one
another
as
dull
as
two
cat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
perhaps
Mrs.
Jennings
be
in
hope
,
by
this
vigorous
sketch
of
their
future
ennui
,
to
provoke
him
to
make
that
offer
,
which
may
give
himself
an
escape
from
it
;
and
if
so
,
she
have
soon
afterwards
good
reason
to
think
her
object
gain
;
for
,
on
Elinor
's
move
to
the
window
to
take
more
expeditiously
the
dimension
of
a
print
,
which
she
be
go
to
copy
for
her
friend
,
he
follow
her
to
it
with
a
look
of
particular
meaning
,
and
converse
with
her
there
for
several
minute
.
<EOS>
the
effect
of
his
discourse
on
the
lady
too
,
could
not
escape
her
observation
,
for
though
she
be
too
honorable
to
listen
,
and
have
even
change
her
seat
,
on
purpose
that
she
may
_
not
_
hear
,
to
one
close
by
the
piano
forte
on
which
Marianne
be
play
,
she
could
not
keep
herself
from
see
that
Elinor
change
colour
,
attend
with
agitation
,
and
be
too
intent
on
what
he
say
to
pursue
her
employment
.
<EOS>
still
farther
in
confirmation
of
her
hope
,
in
the
interval
of
Marianne
's
turn
from
one
lesson
to
another
,
some
word
of
the
Colonel
's
inevitably
reach
her
ear
,
in
which
he
seem
to
be
apologise
for
the
badness
of
his
house
.
<EOS>
this
set
the
matter
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
She
wonder
,
indeed
,
at
his
thinking
it
necessary
to
do
so
;
but
suppose
it
to
be
the
proper
etiquette
.
<EOS>
what
Elinor
say
in
reply
she
could
not
distinguish
,
but
judge
from
the
motion
of
her
lip
,
that
she
do
not
think
_
that
_
any
material
objection
;
 
and
Mrs.
Jennings
commend
her
in
her
heart
for
be
so
honest
.
<EOS>
They
then
talk
on
for
a
few
minute
longer
without
her
catch
a
syllable
,
when
another
lucky
stop
in
Marianne
's
performance
bring
her
these
word
in
the
Colonel
's
calm
voice
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
can
not
take
place
very
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
Astonished
and
shock
at
so
unlover
-
like
a
speech
,
she
be
almost
ready
to
cry
out
,
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
should
hinder
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
check
her
desire
,
confine
herself
to
this
silent
ejaculation
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
strange
!
 
<EOS>
sure
he
nee
not
wait
to
be
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
delay
on
the
Colonel
's
side
,
however
,
do
not
seem
to
offend
or
mortify
his
fair
companion
in
the
least
,
for
on
their
breaking
up
the
conference
soon
afterwards
,
and
move
different
way
,
Mrs.
Jennings
very
plainly
hear
Elinor
say
,
and
with
a
voice
which
show
her
to
feel
what
she
say
    
"
I
shall
always
think
myself
very
much
oblige
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
be
delighted
with
her
gratitude
,
and
only
wonder
that
after
hear
such
a
sentence
,
the
Colonel
should
be
able
to
take
leave
of
them
,
as
he
immediately
do
,
with
the
utmost
sang
-
froid
,
and
go
away
without
make
her
any
reply
!
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
think
her
old
friend
could
have
make
so
indifferent
a
suitor
.
  
<EOS>
what
have
really
pass
between
them
be
to
this
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
,
"
say
he
,
with
great
compassion
,
"
of
the
injustice
your
friend
Mr.
Ferrars
have
suffer
from
his
family
;
for
if
I
understand
the
matter
right
,
he
have
be
entirely
cast
off
by
them
for
persevere
in
his
engagement
with
a
very
deserving
young
woman
.
<EOS>
have
I
be
rightly
inform
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
so
?
 
<EOS>
"
  
Elinor
tell
him
that
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
cruelty
,
the
impolitic
cruelty
,
"
 
he
reply
,
with
great
feeling
,
 
"
of
divide
,
or
attempt
to
divide
,
two
young
people
long
attach
to
each
other
,
be
terrible
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ferrars
do
not
know
what
she
may
be
do
 
what
she
may
drive
her
son
to
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
Mr.
Ferrars
two
or
three
time
in
Harley
Street
,
and
be
much
pleased
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
young
man
with
whom
one
can
be
intimately
acquaint
in
a
short
time
,
but
I
have
see
enough
of
him
to
wish
him
well
for
his
own
sake
,
and
as
a
friend
of
yours
,
I
wish
it
still
more
.
<EOS>
I
understand
that
he
intend
to
take
order
.
<EOS>
Will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
him
that
the
living
of
Delaford
,
now
just
vacant
,
as
I
be
inform
by
this
day
's
post
,
be
his
,
if
he
think
it
worth
his
acceptance
 
<EOS>
but
_
<EOS>
that
_
,
perhaps
,
so
unfortunately
circumstance
as
he
be
now
,
it
may
be
nonsense
to
appear
to
doubt
;
I
only
wish
it
be
more
valuable
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
rectory
,
but
a
small
one
;
the
late
incumbent
,
I
believe
,
do
not
make
more
than
200
l
per

though
it
be
certainly
capable
of
improvement
,
I
fear
,
not
to
such
an
amount
as
to
afford
him
a
very
comfortable
income
.
<EOS>
such
as
it
be

however
,
my
pleasure
in
present
him
to
it

will
be
very
great

<EOS>
pray
assure
him
of
it

"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
's
astonishment
at
this
commission
could
hardly
have
be
great
,
have
the
Colonel
be
really
make
her
an
offer
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
the
preferment
,
which
only
two
day
before
she
have
consider
as
hopeless
for
Edward
,
be
already
provide
to
enable
him
to
marry
;
 
and
_
she
_
,
of
all
people
in
the
world
,
be
fix
on
to
bestow
it
!
 
<EOS>
Her
emotion
be
such
as
Mrs.
Jennings
have
attribute
to
a
very
different
cause
;
 
but
whatever
minor
feeling
<EOS>
less
pure
,
less
pleasing
,
may
have
a
share
in
that
emotion
,
her
esteem
for
the
general
benevolence
,
and
her
gratitude
for
the
particular
friendship
,
which
together
prompt
Colonel
Brandon
to
this
act
,
be
strongly
feel
,
and
warmly
express
.
<EOS>
She
thank
him
for
it
with
all
her
heart
,
speak
of
Edward
's
principle
and
disposition
with
that
praise
which
she
know
them
to
deserve
;
and
promise
to
undertake
the
commission
with
pleasure
,
if
it
be
really
his
wish
to
put
off
so
agreeable
an
office
to
another
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
same
time
,
she
could
not
help
think
that
no
one
could
so
well
perform
it
as
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
office
in
short
,
from
which
,
unwilling
to
give
Edward
the
pain
of
receive
an
obligation
from
_
her
_
,
she
would
have
be
very
glad
to
be
spare
herself
;
but
Colonel
Brandon
,
on
motive
of
equal
delicacy
,
decline
it
likewise
,
still
seem
so
desirous
of
its
be
give
through
her
mean
,
that
she
would
not
on
any
account
make
farth
opposition
.
<EOS>
Edward
,
she
believe
,
be
still
in
town
,
and
fortunately
she
have
hear
his
address
from
Miss
Steele
.
<EOS>
She
could
undertake
therefore
to
inform
him
of
it
,
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
after
this
have
be
settle
,
Colonel
Brandon
begin
to
talk
of
his
own
advantage
in
secure
so
respectable
and
agreeable
a
neighbour
,
and
_
then
_
<EOS>
it
be
that
he
mention
with
regret
,
that
the
house
be
small
and
indifferent
;
<EOS>
an
evil
which
Elinor
,
as
Mrs.
Jennings
have
suppose
her
to
do
,
make
very
light
of
,
at
least
as
far
as
regard
its
size
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
smallness
of
the
house
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
can
not
imagine
any
inconvenience
to
them
,
for
it
will
be
in
proportion
to
their
family
and
income
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
by
which
the
Colonel
be
surprised
to
find
that
_
she
_
be
consider
Mr.
Ferrars
's
marriage
as
the
certain
consequence
of
the
presentation
;
for
he
do
not
suppose
it
possible
that
Delaford
living
could
supply
such
an
income
,
as
anybody
in
his
style
of
life
would
venture
to
settle
on
,
and
he
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
little
rectory
_
can
_
do
no
more
than
make
Mr.
Ferrars
comfortable
as
a
bachelor
;
it
can
not
enable
him
to
marry
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
say
that
my
patronage
end
with
this
;
and
my
interest
be
hardly
more
extensive
.
<EOS>
if
,
however
,
by
an
unforeseen
chance
it
should
be
in
my
power
to
serve
him
farther
,
I
must
think
very
differently
of
him
from
what
I
now
do
,
if
I
be
not
as
ready
to
be
useful
to
him
then
as
I
sincerely
wish
I
could
be
at
present
.
<EOS>
what
I
be
now
do
indeed
,
seem
nothing
at
all
,
since
it
can
advance
him
so
little
towards
what
must
be
his
principal
,
his
only
object
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
His
marriage
must
still
be
a
distant
good
;
 
at
least
,
I
be
afraid
it
can
not
take
place
very
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
sentence
which
,
when
misunderstood
,
so
justly
offend
the
delicate
feeling
of
Mrs.
Jennings
;
but
after
this
narration
of
what
really
pass
between
Colonel
Brandon
and
Elinor
,
while
they
stand
at
the
window
,
the
gratitude
express
by
the
latter
on
their
parting
,
may
perhaps
appear
in
general
,
not
less
reasonably
excited
,
nor
less
properly
word
than
if
it
have
arise
from
an
offer
of
marriage
.
    
<EOS>
"
well
,
Miss
Dashwood
,
"
say
Mrs.
Jennings
,
sagaciously
smile
,
as
soon
as
the
gentleman
have
withdraw
,
"
I
do
not
ask
you
what
the
Colonel
have
be
say
to
you
;
for
though
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
_
try
_
to
keep
out
of

I
could
not

I
assure
you
I
never

It
be
a
matter
of
great
joy

me

I
feel
the
goodness

most
sensibly

there

I

You
judge
from

could
not

the
opportunity
would
so
very
soon
occur

Mrs.

that
I
do

indeed

I
do

all
over

evening

for
we
shall
be
quite
alone

<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
you
to
go
with
me

for
I
dare
say
your
mind
be
too
full
of
the
matter

besides
,
you
must
long

!

very
well

Mrs.

then
you
would
not

of
importance

will

have
much
to
do

this
speech
at
first
puzzle
Mrs.

exceedingly
.
<EOS>
why
Mr.

be
to
have
be
write
to
about
it
in
such
a
hurry
,
she
could
not
immediately
comprehend
.
<EOS>
a
few
moment
'
reflection
,
however
,
produce
a
very
happy
idea
,
and
she
exclaim
    
"
oh
,
ho
!
<EOS>
I
understand
you
.
<EOS>
Mr.

be
to
be
the
man

<EOS>
well
,
so
much
the
well
for
him

<EOS>
ay
,
to
be
sure
,
he
must
be
ordain
in
readiness
;
and
I
be
very
glad
to
find
thing
be
so
forward
between
you
.
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
,
be
not
this
rather
out
of
character
?
<EOS>
Should
not
the
Colonel
write
himself
?
<EOS>
sure
,
he
be
the
proper
person
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
do
not
quite
understand
the
beginning
of
Mrs.
Jennings
's
speech
,
neither
do
she
think
it
worth
inquire
into
;
and
therefore
only
reply
to
its
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Colonel
Brandon
be
so
delicate
a
man
,
that
he
rather
wish
any
one
to
announce
his
intention
to
Mr.
Ferrars
than
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
_
you
_
be
force
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
well
_
that
_
be
an
odd
kind
of
delicacy
!
<EOS>
however
,
I
will
not
disturb
you
(
see
her
prepare
to
write

)
<EOS>
You
know
your
own
concern
best
.
<EOS>
so
good
-
bye
,
my

<EOS>
I
have
not
hear
of
any
thing
to
please
me
so
well
since
Charlotte
be
bring
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
away
she
go
;
but
return
again
in
a
moment
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
be
think
of
Betty
's
sister
,
my
dear

<EOS>
I
should
be
very
glad
to
get
her
so
good
a
mistress

but
whether
she
would
do
for
a
lady
's
maid
,
I
be
sure
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
She
be
an
excellent
housemaid
,
and
work
very
well
at
her
needle
.
<EOS>
however
,
you
will
think
of
all
that
at
your
leisure

"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
madam

"
reply
Elinor
,
not
hear
much
of
what
she
say
,
and
more
anxious
to
be
alone
,
than
to
be
mistress
of
the
subject

<EOS>
how
she
should
begin
 
how
she
should
express
herself
in
her
note
to
Edward
,
be
now
all
her
concern

<EOS>
the
particular
circumstance
between
them
make
a
difficulty
of
that
which
to
any
other
person
would
have
be
the
easy
thing
in
the
world
;
but
she
equally
fear
to
say
too
much
or
too
little
,
and
sit
deliberate
over
her
paper
,
with
the
pen
in
her
hand
,
till
break
in
on
by
the
entrance
of
Edward
himself
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
meet
Mrs.
Jennings
at
the
door
in
her
way
to
the
carriage
,
as
he
come
to
leave
his
farewell
card
;
and
she
,
after
apologise
for
not
return
herself
,
have
oblige
him
to
enter
,
by
say
that
Miss
Dashwood
be
above
,
and
want
to
speak
with
him
on
very
particular
business

<EOS>
Elinor
have
just
be
congratulate
herself
,
in
the
midst
of
her
perplexity
,
that
however
difficult
it
may
be
to
express
herself
properly
by
letter
,
it
be
at
least
preferable
to
give
the
information
by
word
of
mouth
,
when
her
visitor
enter
,
to
force
her
upon
this
great
exertion
of
all
.
<EOS>
Her
astonishment
and
confusion
be
very
great
on
his
so
sudden
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
see
him
before
since
his
engagement
become
public
,
and
therefore
not
since
his
know
her
to
be
acquaint
with
it
;
which
,
with
the
consciousness
of
what
she
have
be
think
of
,
and
what
she
have
to
tell
him
,
make
her
feel
particularly
uncomfortable
for
some
minute
.
<EOS>
He
too
be
much
distressed
;
and
they
sit
down
together
in
a
most
promising
state
of
embarrassment

<EOS>
whether
he
have
ask
her
pardon
for
his
intrusion
on
first
come
into
the
room
,
he
could
not
recollect
;
but
determine
to
be
on
the
safe
side
,
he
make
his
apology
in
form
as
soon
as
he
could
say
any
thing

after
take
a
chair

he
could
not
say
it
himself

can
not

expect
that
any
one
else
should
say
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
_
look
_
<EOS>
all
the
astonishment
which
such
unexpected
,
such
unthought
-
of
information
could
not
fail
of
exciting
;
but
he
say
only
these
two
word
    
"
Colonel
Brandon
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
continue
Elinor
,
gather
more
resolution
,
as
some
of
the
bad
be
over
<EOS>
,
"
Colonel
Brandon
mean
it
as
a
testimony
of
his
concern
for
what
have
lately
pass
 
for
the
cruel
situation
in
which
the
unjustifiable
conduct
of
your
family
have
place
you
 
a
concern
which
I
be
sure
Marianne
,
myself
,
and
all
your
friend
,
must
share
;
and
likewise
as
a
proof
of
his
high
esteem
for
your
general
character
,
and
his
particular
approbation
of
your
behaviour
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Colonel
Brandon
give
_
me
_
a
living
!
 
<EOS>
Can
it
be
possible
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
unkindness
of
your
own
relation
have
make
you
astonished
to
find
friendship
any
where

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
no

"
replied
be
,
with
sudden
consciousness
,
"
not
to
find
it
in

you

I
can
not

that
to
you

your
goodness

I
owe
it
all
.
<EOS>
I
feel
it
 
I
would
express
it
if
I
could

but
,
as
you
well
know
,
I
be
no
orator
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
much
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
that
you
owe
it
entirely
,
at
least
almost
entirely
,
to
your
own
merit
,
and
Colonel
Brandon
's
discernment
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
no
hand
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
even
know
,
till
I
understand
his
design
,
that
the
living
be
vacant
;
nor
have
it
ever
occur
to
me
that
he
may
have
have
such
a
living
in
his
gift
.
<EOS>
as
a
friend
of
mine
,
of
my
family
,
he
may
,
perhaps
 
indeed
I
know
he
_
have
_
,
still
great
pleasure
in
bestow
it
;
but
,
upon
my
word
,
you
owe
nothing
to
my
solicitation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Truth
oblige
her
to
acknowledge
some
small
share
in
the
action
,
but
she
be
at
the
same
time
so
unwilling
to
appear
as
the
benefactress
of
Edward
,
that
she
acknowledge
it
with
hesitation
;
which
probably
contribute
to
fix
that
suspicion
in
his
mind
which
have
recently
enter
it
.
<EOS>
for
a
short
time
he
sit
deep
in
thought
,
after
Elinor
have
cease
to
speak
;
 
at
last
,
and
as
if
it
be
rather
an
effort
,
he
say
    
"
Colonel
Brandon
seem
a
man
of
great
worth
and
respectability
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
hear
him
speak
of
as
such
,
and
your
brother
<EOS>
I
know
esteem
him
highly
.
<EOS>
He
be
undoubtedly
a
sensible
man
,
and
in
his
manner
perfectly
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
reply
Elinor
,
"
I
believe
that
you
will
find
him
,
on
farth
acquaintance
,
all
that
you
have
hear
him
to
be
,
and
as
you
will
be
such
very
near
neighbour
<EOS>
(
for
I
understand
the
parsonage
be
almost
close
to
the
mansion
-
house
,
)
<EOS>
it
be
particularly
important
that
he
_
should
_
be
all
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edward
make
no
answer
;
but
when
she
have
turn
away
her
head
,
give
her
a
look
so
serious
,
so
earnest
,
so
uncheerful
,
as
seem
to
say
,
that
he
may
hereafter
wish
the
distance
between
the
parsonage
and
the
mansion
-
house
much
great
.
  
<EOS>
"
Colonel
Brandon
,
I
think
,
lodge
in
St.
James
Street
,
"
say
he
,
soon
afterwards
,
rise
from
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
tell
him
the
number
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
hurry
away
then
,
to
give
him
those
thank
which
you
will
not
allow
me
to
give
_
you
_
;
to
assure
him
that
he
have
make
me
a
very
 
an
exceedingly
happy
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
do
not
offer
to
detain
him
;
and
they
part
,
with
a
very
earnest
assurance
on
_
<EOS>
her
_
side
of
her
uncease
good
wish
for
his
happiness
in
every
change
of
situation
that
may
befall
him
;
on
_
his
_
,
with
rather
an
attempt
to
return
the
same
good
will
,
than
the
power
of
express
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
see
him
again
,
"
say
Elinor
to
herself
,
<EOS>
as
the
door
shut
him
out
,
"
I
shall
see
him
the
husband
of
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
with
this
pleasing
anticipation
,
she
sit
down
to
reconsider
the
past
,
recall
the
word
and
endeavour
to
comprehend
all
the
feeling
of
Edward
;
and
,
of
course
,
to
reflect
on
her
own
with
discontent
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Jennings
come
home
,
though
she
return
from
see
people
whom
she
have
never
see
before
,
and
of
whom
therefore
she
must
have
a
great
deal
to
say
,
her
mind
be
so
much
more
occupy
by
the
important
secret
in
her
possession
,
than
by
anything
else
,
that
she
revert
to
it
again
as
soon
as
Elinor
appear
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
she
cry
,
"
I
send
you
up
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
do
not
I
do
right
?
 
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
you
have
no
great
difficulty
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
find
him
very
unwilling
to
accept
your
proposal
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

madam

_
that
_
be
not

likely

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
how
soon
will
he
be
ready
?
 
<EOS>
for
it
seem
all
to
depend
upon
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
really
,
"
say
Elinor
,
"
I
know
so
little
of
these
kind
of
form
,
that
I
can
hardly
even
conjecture
as
to
the
time
,
or
the
preparation
necessary
;
but
I
suppose
two
or
three
month
will
complete
his
ordination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
two
or
three
month
!
"
cry
Mrs.
Jennings
;
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
how
calmly
you
talk
of
it
;
and
can
the
Colonel
wait
two
or
three
month
!
<EOS>
Lord
bless
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
would
put
_
me
_
quite
out
of
patience
!
 
<EOS>
and
though
one
would
be
very
glad
to
do
a
kindness
by
poor
Mr.
Ferrars
,
I
do
think
it
be
not
worth
while
to
wait
two
or
three
month
for
him
.
<EOS>
sure
somebody
else
may
be
find
that
would
do
as
well
;
somebody
that
be
in
order
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
madam
,
"
say
Elinor
,
"
what
can
you
be
think
of
?
<EOS>
why
,
Colonel
Brandon
's
only
object
be
to
be
of
use
to
Mr.
Ferrars
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lord
bless
you
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
sure
you
do
not
mean
to
persuade
me
that
the
Colonel
only
marry
you
for
the
sake
of
give
ten
guinea
to
Mr.
Ferrars
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
deception
could
not
continue
after
this
;
and
an
explanation
immediately
take
place
,
by
which
both
gain
considerable
amusement
for
the
moment
,
without
any
material
loss
of
happiness
to
either
,
for
Mrs.
Jennings
only
exchange
one
form
of
delight
for
another
,
and
still
without
forfeit
her
expectation
of
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
aye
,
the
parsonage
be
but
a
small
one
,
"
say
she
,
after
the
first
ebullition
of
surprise
and
satisfaction
be
over
,
"
and
very
likely
_
may
_
be
out
of
repair
;
but
to
hear
a
man
apologise
,
as
I
think
,
for
a
house
that
to
my
knowledge
have
five
sit
room
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
and
I
think
the
housekeeper
tell
me
could
make
up
fifteen
bed
!
<EOS>
and
to
you
too
,
that
have
be
use
to
live
in
Barton
cottage
!
<EOS>
It
seem
quite
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
,
we
must
touch
up
the
Colonel
to
do
some
thing
to
the
parsonage
,
and
make
it
comfortable
for
them
,
before
Lucy
go
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
Colonel
Brandon
do
not
seem
to
have
any
idea
of
the
living
's
be
enough
to
allow
them
to
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
Colonel
be
a
ninny
,
my
dear
;
because
he
have
two
thousand
a
-
year
himself
,
he
think
that
nobody
else
can
marry
on
less
.
<EOS>
take
my
word
for
it
,
that
,
if
I
be
alive
,
I
shall
be
pay
a
visit
at
Delaford
Parsonage
before
Michaelmas
;
and
I
be
sure
I
shall
not
go
if
Lucy
an't
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
be
quite
of
her
opinion
,
as
to
the
probability
of
their
not
wait
for
any
thing
more
.
    
<EOS>
Edward
,
have
carry
his
thank
to
Colonel
Brandon
,
proceed
with
his
happiness
to
Lucy
;
and
such
be
the
excess
of
it
by
the
time
he
reach
Bartlett
's
Buildings
,
that
she
be
able
to
assure
Mrs.
Jennings
,
who
call
on
her
again
the
next
day
with
her
congratulation
,
that
she
have
never
see
him
in
such
spirit
before
in
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
Her
own
happiness
,
and
her
own
spirit
,
be
at
least
very
certain
;
and
she
join
Mrs.
Jennings
most
heartily
in
her
expectation
of
their
be
all
comfortably
together
in
Delaford
Parsonage
before
Michaelmas
.
<EOS>
so
far
be
she
,
at
the
same
time
,
from
any
backwardness
to
give
Elinor
that
credit
which
Edward
_
would
_
give
her
,
that
she
speak
of
her
friendship
for
them
both
with
the
most
grateful
warmth
,
be
ready
to
own
all
their
obligation
to
her
,
and
openly
declare
that
no
exertion
for
their
good
on
Miss
Dashwood
's
part
,
either
present
or
future
,
would
ever
surprise
her
,
for
she
believe
her
capable
of
do
any
thing
in
the
world
for
those
she
really
value
.
<EOS>
as
for
Colonel
Brandon
,
she
be
not
only
ready
to
worship
him
as
a
saint
,
but
be
moreover
truly
anxious
that
he
should
be
treat
as
one
in
all
worldly
concern
;
anxious
that
his
tithe
should
be
raise
to
the
utmost
;
and
scarcely
resolve
to
avail
herself
,
at
Delaford
,
as
far
as
she
possibly
could
,
of
his
servant
,
his
carriage
,
his
cow
,
and
his
poultry
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
above
a
week
since
John
Dashwood
have
call
in
Berkeley
Street
,
and
as
since
that
time
no
notice
have
be
take
by
them
of
his
wife
's
indisposition
,
beyond
one
verbal
enquiry
,
Elinor
begin
to
feel
it
necessary
to
pay
her
a
visit
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
obligation
,
however
,
which
not
only
oppose
her
own
inclination
,
but
which
have
not
the
assistance
of
any
encouragement
from
her
companion
.
<EOS>
Marianne
,
not
content
with
absolutely
refuse
to
go
herself
,
be
very
urgent
to
prevent
her
sister
be
go
at
all
;
and
Mrs.
Jennings
,
though
her
carriage
be
always
at
Elinor
's
service
,
so
very
much
dislike
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
,
that
not
even
her
curiosity
to
see
how
she
look
after
the
late
discovery
,
nor
her
strong
desire
to
affront
her
by
take
Edward
's
part
,
could
overcome
her
unwillingness
to
be
in
her
company
again
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
that
Elinor
set
out
by
herself
to
pay
a
visit
,
for
which
no
one
could
really
have
less
inclination
,
and
to
run
the
risk
of
a
tête
-
à
-
tête
with
a
woman
,
whom
neither
of
the
other
have
so
much
reason
to
dislike
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
be
deny
;
but
before
the
carriage
could
turn
from
the
house
,
her
husband
accidentally
come
out
.
<EOS>
He
express
great
pleasure
in
meet
Elinor
,
tell
her
that
he
have
be
just
go
to
call
in
Berkeley
Street
,
and
,
assure
her
that
Fanny
would
be
very
glad
to
see
her
,
invite
her
to
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
They
walk
up
stair
in
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
nobody
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fanny
be
in
her
own
room
,
I
suppose
,
"
say
he
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
her
presently
,
for
I
be
sure
she
will
not
have
the
least
objection
in
the
world
to
see
_
you
.
<EOS>
_
very
far
from
it

indeed
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
now
_
<EOS>
especially
there
can
not
be
 
but
<EOS>
however
,
you
and
Marianne
be
always
great
favourite
.
<EOS>
why
would
not
Marianne
come
?
"
    
<EOS>
Elinor
make
what
excuse
she
could
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
sorry
to
see
you
alone
,
"
he
reply
,
"
for
I
have
a
good
deal
to
say
to
you

<EOS>
this
living
of
Colonel
Brandon

can
it
be
true
?
 
<EOS>
have
he
really
give
it
to
Edward

I
hear
it
yesterday
by
chance

be
come
to
you
on
purpose
to
enquire
farther
about
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
perfectly
true

<EOS>
Colonel

have
give
the
living
of
Delaford
to
Edward

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
really
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
this
be
very
astonishing
!
 
<EOS>
no
relationship
!
 
<EOS>
no
connection
between
them
!
 
<EOS>
and
now
that
living
fetch
such
a
price
!
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
value
of
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
about
two
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
 
and
for
the
next
presentation
to
a
living
of
that
value
 
suppose
the
late
incumbent
to
have
be
old
and
sickly
,
and
likely
to
vacate
it
soon
 
<EOS>
he
may
have
get
I
dare
say
 
fourteen
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
and
how
come
he
not
to
have
settle
that
matter
before
this
person
's
death
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
now
_
indeed
it
would
be
too
late
to
sell
it
,
but
a
man
of
Colonel
Brandon
's
sense
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
he
should
be
so
improvident
in
a
point
of
such
common
,
such
natural
,
concern
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
convinced
that
there
be
a
vast
deal
of
inconsistency
in
almost
every
human
character
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
however
 
on
recollection
 
that
the
case
may
probably
be
_
this
.
<EOS>
_
Edward
be
only
to
hold
the
living
till
the
person
to
whom
the
Colonel
have
really
sell
the
presentation
,
be
old
enough
to
take
it

the

It

well

lucky

You

not

I

it

it
vastly
well

she

not

<EOS>
Elinor
have
some
difficulty
here
to
refrain
from
observe

that
she
think
Fanny
may
have
bear
with
composure
,
an
acquisition
of
wealth
to
her
brother

by
which
neither
she

could
be
possibly
impoverish
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
"
add
he
,
lower
his
voice
to
the
tone
become
so
important
a
subject
,
"
know
nothing
about
it
at
present
,
and
I
believe
it
will
be
good
to
keep
it
entirely
conceal
from
her
as
long
as
may
be
.
<EOS>
when
the
marriage
take
place
,
I
fear
she
must
hear
of
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
should
such
precaution
be
use
?
<EOS>
though
it
be
not
to

suppose
that
Mrs.

can
have
the
small
satisfaction
in
know
that
her

have
money
enough
to
live
upon

for
_
that

quite
out

yet
why
,
upon
her
late
behaviour

be
she
suppose
to

at
all

<EOS>
She
have
do
with
her
son

she
cast
him
off
for
ever

and
have
make
all
those
over
whom
she
have
any

cast
him
off
likewise

<EOS>
surely
,
after
do
so

she
can
not

imagine
liable
to
any
impression
of
sorrow

of
joy
on
his
account
 
<EOS>
she
can
not
be
interested
in
any
thing
that
befall
him

<EOS>
She
would
not
be
so
weak
as
to
throw
away
the
comfort
of
a

yet
retain
the
anxiety
of

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
Elinor

John

"
your
reasoning

very
good

when

upon

his

feel

therefore
every
circumstance

that
dreadful

Mrs.

certainly
,
there
can

no

consider
as

son

as
to
any

agreeable

end
thus

<EOS>
"
of

thing

my

kindly
take
her

awful
whisper

I
may
assure
you
;

I
_
will
_
do
it
,
because
I
know
it
must
gratify
you

<EOS>
I
have
good
reason
to
think
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
have
it
from
the
good
authority
,
or
I
should
not
repeat
it
,
<EOS>
for
otherwise
it
would
be
very
wrong
to
say
any
thing
about
it
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
it
from
the
very
good
authority

<EOS>
not
that
I
ever
precisely
hear
Mrs.

say
it
herself
 
<EOS>

her
daughter
_
do
_
,
<EOS>

I
have
it
from
her

that
in

,
whatever
objection
there
may
be
against
a
certain
 
a
certain
connection

,
you
understand
me
,
 
it
would
have
be
far
preferable
to
her

it
would
not
have
give
her
half
the
vexation
that
_
<EOS>
this
_
do

<EOS>
I
be
exceedingly
pleased
to
hear
that
Mrs.
Ferrars
consider
it
in
that
light
;
a
very
gratifying
circumstance
you
know
to
us
all

<EOS>
"
It
would
have
be
beyond
comparison
,
"
she
say
,
"
the
least
evil
of
the
two

she
would
be
glad
to
compound
_

for
nothing

<EOS>

however
,
all
that
be
quite
out

not

<EOS>
as

any
attachment
you
know

it
never

all
that

go
by

I
think
I
would
just
tell
you
of
this

I

<EOS>
not
that
you

any

there

no

quite
as
well

perhaps

all

consider

have
Colonel
Brandon
be
with
you
lately
?
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
have
hear
enough
,
if
not
to
gratify
her
vanity
,
and
raise
her
self
-
importance
,
to
agitate
her
nerve
and
fill
her
mind
;
 
and
she
be
therefore
glad
to
be
spare
from
the
necessity
of
say
much
in
reply
herself
,
and
from
the
danger
of
hear
any
thing
more
from
her
brother
,
by
the
entrance
of
Mr.
Robert
Ferrars
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
moment
'
chat
,
John
Dashwood
,
recollect
that
Fanny
be
yet
uninformed
of
her
sister
's
be
there
,
quit
the
room
in
quest
of
her
;
and
Elinor
be
leave
to
improve
her
acquaintance
with
Robert
,
who
,
by
the
gay
unconcern
,
the
happy
self
-
complacency
of
his
manner
while
enjoy
so
unfair
a
division
of
his
mother
's
love
and
liberality
,
to
the
prejudice
of
his
banished
brother
,
earn
only
by
his
own
dissipated
course
of
life
,
and
that
brother
's
integrity
,
be
confirm
her
most
unfavourable
opinion
of
his
head
and
heart
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
scarcely
be
two
minute
by
themselves
,
before
he
begin
to
speak
of
Edward
;
for
he
,
too
,
have
hear
of
the
living
,
and
be
very
inquisitive
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Elinor
repeat
the
particular
of
it
,
as
she
have
give
them
to
John
;
and
their
effect
on
Robert
,
though
very
different
,
be
not
less
striking
than
it
have
be
on
_
him
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
laugh
most
immoderately
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
Edward
's
be
a
clergyman
,
and
live
in
a
small
parsonage
-
house
,
divert
him
beyond
measure
;
 
and
when
to
that
be
add
the
fanciful
imagery
of
Edward
read
prayer
in
a
white
surplice
,
and
publish
the
bann
of
marriage
between
John
Smith
and
Mary
Brown
,
he
could
conceive
nothing
more
ridiculous
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
,
while
she
wait
in
silence
and
immovable
gravity
,
the
conclusion
of
such
folly
,
could
not
restrain
her
eye
from
be
fix
on
him
with
a
look
that
speak
all
the
contempt
it
excited
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
look
,
however
,
very
well
bestow
,
for
it
relieve
her
own
feeling
,
and
give
no
intelligence
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
recall
from
wit
to
wisdom
,
not
by
any
reproof
of
her
's
,
but
by
his
own
sensibility
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
may
treat
it
as
a
joke
,
"
say
he
,
at
last
,
recover
from
the
affected
laugh
which
have
considerably
lengthen
out
the
genuine
gaiety
of
the
moment
;
"
but
,
upon
my
soul
,
it
be
a
most
serious
business
.
<EOS>
Poor
Edward
!
<EOS>
he
be
ruin
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
be
extremely
sorry
for
it
;
for
I
know
him
to
be
a
very
good
-
hearted
creature
,
 
<EOS>
as
well
-
mean
a
fellow
perhaps
,
as
any
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
judge
of
him
,
Miss
Dashwood
,
from
_
your
_
slight
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
poor
Edward
!
<EOS>
His
manner
be
certainly
not
the
happy
in
nature
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
not
all
bear
,
you
know
,
with
the
same
power
,
 
the
same
address
.
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
to
see
him
in
a
circle
of
stranger
!
<EOS>
to
be
sure
it
be
pitiable
enough
;
but
upon
my
soul
,
I
believe
he
have
as
good
a
heart
as
any
in
the
kingdom
;
and
I
declare
and
protest
to
you
<EOS>
I
never
be
so
shocked
in
my
life
,
as
when
it
all
burst
forth
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
My
mother
be
the
first
person
who
tell
me
of
it
;
and
<EOS>
I
,
feel
myself
call
on
to
act
with
resolution
,
immediately
say
to
her
,
 
"
<EOS>
My
dear
madam
,
I
do
not
know
what
you
may
intend
to
do
on
the
occasion
,
but
as
for
myself
,
I
must
say
,
that
if
Edward
do
marry
this
young
woman
,
I
never
will
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
I
say
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
be
most
uncommonly
shocked
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Poor
Edward
!
<EOS>
he
have
do
for
himself
completely
,
 
shut
himself
out
for
ever
from
all
decent
society
!
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
directly
say
to
my
mother
,
I
be
not
in
the
least
surprised
at
it
;
from
his
style
of
education
,
it
be
always
to
be
expect
.
<EOS>
My
poor
mother
be
half
frantic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
ever
see
the
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
once
,
while
she
be
stay
in
this
house
,
I
happen
to
drop
in
for
ten
minute
;
and
I
see
quite
enough
of
her
.
<EOS>
the
mere
awkward
country
girl
,
without
style
,
or
elegance
,
and
almost
without
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
remember
her
perfectly
.
<EOS>
just
the
kind
of
girl
<EOS>
I
should
suppose
likely
to
captivate
poor
Edward
.
<EOS>
I
offer
immediately
,
as
soon
as
my
mother
relate
the
affair
to
me
,
to
talk
to
him
myself
,
and
dissuade
him
from
the
match
;
but
it
be
too
late
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
then
_
,
I
find
,
to
do
any
thing
,
for
unluckily
<EOS>
,
I
be
not
in
the
way
at
first
,
and
know
nothing
of
it
till
after
the
breach
have
take
place
,
when
it
be
not
for
me
,
you
know
,
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
but
have
I
be
inform
of
it
a
few
hour
earlier
,
I
think
it
be
most
probable
that
something
may
have
be
hit
on
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
should
have
represent
it
to
Edward
in
a
very
strong
light
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
I
should
have
say
,
"
consider
what
you
be
do
.
<EOS>
You
be
make
a
most
disgraceful
connection
,
and
such
a
one
as
your
family
be
unanimous
in
disapprove
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
think
,
in
short
,
that
mean
may
have
be
find
.
<EOS>
but
now
it
be
all
too
late
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
starve
,
you
know
,
that
be
certain
;
absolutely
starve
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
just
settle
this
point
with
great
composure
,
when
the
entrance
of
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
put
an
end
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
but
though
_
she
_
never
speak
of
it
out
of
her
own
family
,
Elinor
could
see
its
influence
on
her
mind
,
in
the
something
like
confusion
of
countenance
with
which
she
enter
,
and
an
attempt
at
cordiality
in
her
behaviour
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
even
proceed
so
far
as
to
be
concern
to
find
that
Elinor
and
her
sister
be
so
soon
to
leave
town
,
as
she
have
hope
to
see
more
of
them
;
 
an
exertion
in
which
her
husband
,
who
attend
her
into
the
room
,
and
hang
enamour
over
her
accent
,
seem
to
distinguish
every
thing
that
be
most
affectionate
and
graceful
.
    
<EOS>
one
other
short
call
in
Harley
Street
,
in
which
Elinor
receive
her
brother
's
congratulation
on
their
travelling
so
far
towards
Barton
without
any
expense
,
and
on
Colonel
Brandon
be
be
to
follow
them
to
Cleveland
in
a
day
or
two
,
complete
the
intercourse
of
the
brother
and
sister
in
town
;
 
and
a
faint
invitation
from
Fanny
,
to
come
to
Norland
whenever
it
should
happen
to
be
in
their
way
,
which
of
all
thing
be
the
most
unlikely
to
occur
,
with
a
more
warm
,
though
less
public
,
assurance
,
from
John
to
Elinor
,
of
the
promptitude
with
which
he
should
come
to
see
her
at
Delaford
,
be
all
that
foretold
any
meeting
in
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
It
amuse
her
to
observe
that
all
her
friend
seem
determined
to
send
her
to
Delaford
;
 
<EOS>
a
place
,
in
which
,
of
all
other
,
she
would
now
least
choose
to
visit

to
reside
;
for
not
only
be
it

as
her
future
home
by
her
brother

Mrs.
Jennings
,
but
even
Lucy

when
they
part

give
her
a
press
invitation
to
visit
her
there

very
early
in
April

two
party

through

begin
to
be

to

grecian
temple

her
eye
,
wander
over
a
wide
tract
of
country
to
the
south

could
fondly
rest

the

ridge

and
fancy
that
from
their
summit
Combe
Magna
may
be

<EOS>
in
such
moment
of
precious
,
invaluable
misery

she
rejoice
in
tear
of
agony
to
be
at
Cleveland
;
and
as

feel
all
the
happy
privilege
of
country
liberty
,
of
wander
from
place
to

in

luxurious
solitude

she
resolve
to
spend
almost
every
hour
of
every
day
while
she
remain
with
the
Palmers
,
in
the
indulgence
of
such
solitary
ramble
.
  
<EOS>
She
return
just
in
time
to
join
the
other
as
they
quit
the
house
,
on
an
excursion
through
its
more
immediate
premise

the
rest
of
the
morning
be
easily
while
away
,
in
lounge
round
the
kitchen
garden
,
examine
the
bloom
upon
its
wall
,
and
listen
to
the
gardener
's
lamentation
upon
blight
,
in
dawdle
through
the
green

house
,
where
the
loss
of
her
favourite
plant
,
unwarily
expose
,
and
nip
by
the
linger
frost
,
raise
the
laughter
of
Charlotte

and
in
visit
her
poultry

yard
,
where

in
the
disappointed
hope
of
her
dairy

maid
,
by
hen
forsake
their
nest

steal

a
fox

or
in
the
rapid
decrease

a
promising
young
brood

she
find
fresh
source
of
merriment

<EOS>
the
morning

fine

dry

Marianne
,
in
her
plan
of
employment
abroad
,
have
not
calculate
for
any
change
of
weather
during
their
stay
at
Cleveland

<EOS>
with
great
surprise
therefore
,
do
she
find
herself
prevent
by
a
settle
rain
from
go
out
again
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
She
have
depend
on
a
twilight
walk
to
the
grecian
temple
,
and
perhaps
all
over
the
ground
,
and
an
evening
merely
cold
or
damp
would
not
have
deter
her
from
it
;
but
a
heavy
and
settled
rain
even
_
<EOS>
she
_
could
not
fancy
dry
or
pleasant
weather
for
walk
.
  
<EOS>
Their
party
be
small
,
and
the
hour
pass
quietly
away
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Palmer
have
her
child
,
and
Mrs.
Jennings
her
carpet
-
work
;
they
talk
of
the
friend
they
have
leave
behind
,
arrange
Lady
Middleton
's
engagement
,
and
wonder
whether
Mr.
Palmer
and
Colonel
Brandon
would
get
farth
than
read
that
night
.
<EOS>
Elinor
,
however
little
concerned
in
it
,
join
in
their
discourse
;
and
Marianne
,
who
have
the
knack
of
find
her
way
in
every
house
to
the
library
,
however
it
may
be
avoid
by
the
family
in
general
,
soon
procure
herself
a
book
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
be
want
on
Mrs.
Palmer
's
side
that
constant
and
friendly
good
humour
could
do
,
to
make
them
feel
themselves
welcome
.
<EOS>
the
openness
and
heartiness
of
her
manner
more
than
atone
for
that
want
of
recollection
and
elegance
which
make
her
often
deficient
in
the
form
of
politeness
;
her
kindness
,
recommend
by
so
pretty
a
face
,
be
engage
;
her
folly
,
though
evident
be
not
disgusting
,
because
it
be
not
conceite
;
and
Elinor
could
have
forgive
every
thing
but
her
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
gentleman
arrive
the
next
day
to
a
very
late
dinner
,
afford
a
pleasant
enlargement
of
the
party
,
and
a
very
welcome
variety
to
their
conversation
,
which
a
long
morning
of
the
same
continue
rain
have
reduce
very
low
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
have
see
so
little
of
Mr.
Palmer
,
and
in
that
little
have
see
so
much
variety
in
his
address
to
her
sister
and
herself
,
that
she
know
not
what
to
expect
to
find
him
in
his
own
family
.
<EOS>
She
find
him
,
however
,
perfectly
the
gentleman
in
his
behaviour
to
all
his
visitor
,
and
only
occasionally
rude
to
his
wife
and
her
mother
;
she
find
him
very
capable
of
be
a
pleasant
companion
,
and
only
prevent
from
be
so
always
,
by
too
great
an
aptitude
to
fancy
himself
as
much
superior
to
people
in
general
,
as
he
must
feel
himself
to
be
to
Mrs.
Jennings
and
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
for
the
rest
of
his
character
and
habit
,
they
be
mark
,
as
far
as
Elinor
could
perceive
,
with
no
trait
at
all
unusual
in
his
sex
and
time
of
life
.
<EOS>
He
be
nice
in
his
eating
,
uncertain
in
his
hour
;
fond
of
his
child
,
though
affect
to
slight
it
;
and
idle
away
the
morning
at
billiard
,
which
ought
to
have
be
devote
to
business
.
<EOS>
She
like
him
,
however
,
upon
the
whole
,
much
well
than
she
have
expect
,
and
in
her
heart
be
not
sorry
that
she
could
like
him
no
more
;
not
sorry
to
be
drive
by
the
observation
of
his
epicurism
,
his
selfishness
,
and
his
conceit
,
to
rest
with
complacency
on
the
remembrance
of
Edward
's
generous
temper
,
simple
taste
,
and
diffident
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
of
Edward
,
or
at
least
of
some
of
his
concern
,
she
now
receive
intelligence
from
Colonel
Brandon
,
who
have
be
into
Dorsetshire
lately
;
and
who
,
treat
her
at
once
as
the
disinterested
friend
of
Mr.
Ferrars
,
and
the
kind
of
confidant
of
himself
,
talk
to
her
a
great
deal
of
the
parsonage
at
Delaford
,
describe
its
deficiency
,
and
tell
her
what
he
mean
to
do
himself
towards
remove
them
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
to
her
in
this
,
as
well
as
in
every
other
particular
,
his
open
pleasure
in
meet
her
after
an
absence
of
only
ten
day
,
his
readiness
to
converse
with
her
,
and
his
deference
for
her
opinion
,
may
very
well
justify
Mrs.
Jennings
's
persuasion
of
his
attachment
,
and
would
have
be
enough
,
perhaps
,
have
not
Elinor
still
,
as
from
the
first
,
believe
Marianne
his
real
favourite
,
to
make
her
suspect
it
herself
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
,
such
a
notion
have
scarcely
ever
enter
her
head
,
except
by
Mrs.
Jennings
's
suggestion
;
and
she
could
not
help
believe
herself
the
nice
observer
of
the
two
<EOS>
:
she
watch
his
eye
,
while
Mrs.
Jennings
think
only
of
his
behaviour
;
and
while
his
look
of
anxious
solicitude
on
Marianne
's
feeling
,
in
her
head
and
throat
,
the
beginning
of
a
heavy
cold

because
unexpresse
by
word
,
entirely
escape
the
latter
lady
's
observation
,
 
_
she
_
could
discover
in
them
the
quick
feeling
,
and
needless
alarm
of
a
lover
.
  
<EOS>
two
delightful
twilight
walk
on
the
third
and
fourth
evening
of
her
be
there
,
not
merely
on
the
dry
gravel
of
the
shrubbery
,
but
all
over
the
ground
,
and
especially
in
the
most
distant
part
of
them
,
where
there
be
something
more
of
wildness
than
in
the
rest
,
where
the
tree
be
the
old

and
the
grass
be
the
long
and
wet

have
 
assist
by
the
still
great
imprudence
of
sit
in
her
wet
shoe
and
stocking
 
give
Marianne
a
cold
so
violent
as

though
for
a
day
or

as
usual

all

<EOS>
though
heavy
and
feverish
,
with
a
pain
in
her
limb
,
and
a
cough
,
and
a
sore
throat
,
a
good
night
's
rest
be
to
cure
her
entirely
;
and
it
be
with
difficulty
that
Elinor
prevail
on
her
,
when
she
go
to
bed
,
to
try
one
or
two
of
the
simple
of
the
remedy
.
    
<EOS>
Marianne
get
up
the
next
morning
at
her
usual
time
;
to
every
inquiry
reply
that
she
be
well
,
and
try
to
prove
herself
so

by
engage
in
her
accustomary
employment
.
<EOS>
but
a
day
spend
in
sit
shiver
over
the
fire
with
a
book
in
her
hand
,
which
she
be
unable
to
read
,
or
in
lying
,
weary
and
languid
,
on
a
sofa
,
do
not
speak
much
in
favour
of
her
amendment
;
and
when
,
at
last
,
she
go
early
to
bed
,
more
and
more
indisposed
,
Colonel
Brandon
be
only
astonish
at
her
sister
's
composure
,
who
,
though
attend
and
nurse
her
the
whole
day
,
against
Marianne
's
inclination
,
and
force
proper
medicine
on
her
at
night
,
trust
,
like
Marianne
,
to
the
certainty
and
efficacy
of
sleep
,
and
feel
no
real
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
a
very
restless
and
feverish
night
,
however
,
disappoint
the
expectation
of
both
;
and
when
Marianne
,
after
persist
in
rise
,
confess
herself
unable
to
sit
up
,
and
return
voluntarily
to
her
bed
,
Elinor
be
very
ready
to
adopt
Mrs.
Jennings
's
advice
,
of
send
for
the
Palmers
'
apothecary
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
,
examine
his
patient
,
and
though
encourage
Miss
Dashwood
to
expect
that
a
very
few
day
would
restore
her
sister
to
health
,
yet
,
by
pronounce
her
disorder
to
have
a
putrid
tendency
,
and
allow
the
word
"
infection
"
to
pass
his
lip
,
give
instant
alarm
to
Mrs.
Palmer
,
on
her
baby
's
account
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
,
who
have
be
incline
from
the
first
to
think
Marianne
's
complaint
more
serious
than
Elinor
,
now
look
very
grave
on
Mr.
Harris
's
report
,
and
confirm
Charlotte
's
fear
and
caution
,
urge
the
necessity
of
her
immediate
removal
with
her
infant
;
and
Mr.
Palmer
,
though
treat
their
apprehension
as
idle
,
find
the
anxiety
and
importunity
of
his
wife
too
great
to
be
withstand
.
<EOS>
Her
departure
,
therefore
,
be
fix
on
;
and
within
an
hour
after
Mr.
Harris
's
arrival
,
she
set
off
,
with
her
little
boy
and
his
nurse
,
for
the
house
of
a
near
relation
of
Mr.
Palmer
's
,
who
live
a
few
mile
on
the
other
side
of
Bath
;
whither
her
husband
promise
,
at
her
earnest
entreaty
,
to
join
her
in
a
day
or
two
;
and
whither
<EOS>
she
be
almost
equally
urgent
with
her
mother
to
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
,
however
,
with
a
kindness
of
heart
which
make
Elinor
really
love
her
,
declare
her
resolution
of
not
stir
from
Cleveland
as
long
as
Marianne
remain
ill
,
and
of
endeavour
,
by
her
own
attentive
care
,
to
supply
to
her
the
place
of
the
mother
she
have
take
her
from
;
and
Elinor
find
her
on
every
occasion
a
most
willing
and
active
helpmate
,
desirous
to
share
in
all
her
fatigue
,
and
often
by
her
well
experience
in
nursing
,
of
material
use
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Marianne
,
languid
and
low
from
the
nature
of
her
malady
,
and
feel
herself
universally
ill
,
could
no
longer
hope
that
tomorrow
would
find
her
recover
;
and
the
idea
of
what
tomorrow
would
have
produce
,
but
for
this
unlucky
illness
,
make
every
ailment
severe
<EOS>
;
for
on
that
day
they
be
to
have
begin
their
journey
home
;
and
,
attend
the
whole
way
by
a
servant
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
be
to
have
take
their
mother
by
surprise
on
the
follow
forenoon
.
<EOS>
the
little
she
say
be
all
in
lamentation
of
this
inevitable
delay
;
though
Elinor
try
to
raise
her
spirit
,
and
make
her
believe
,
as
she
_
then
_
really
believe
herself
,
that
it
would
be
a
very
short
one
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
produce
little
or
no
alteration
in
the
state
of
the
patient
;
she
certainly
be
not
well
,
and
,
except
that
there
be
no
amendment
,
do
not
appear
bad
.
<EOS>
Their
party
be
now
farther
reduce
;
for
Mr.
Palmer
,
though
very
unwilling
to
go
as
well
from
real
humanity
and
good

nature
,
as
from
a
dislike

to

at
last
by
Colonel
Brandon
to
perform
his
promise
of
follow
her
;
and
while
he
be
prepare
to
go
,
Colonel
Brandon
himself
,
with
a
much
great
exertion
,
begin
to
talk
of
go
likewise
.
<EOS>
here
,
however
,
the
kindness
of
Mrs.
Jennings
interpose
most
acceptably
;
for
to
send
the
Colonel
away
while
his
love
be
in
so
much
uneasiness
on
her
sister
's
account
,
would
be
to
deprive
them
both
,
she
think
,
of
every
comfort
;
and
therefore
tell
him
at
once
that
his
stay
at
Cleveland
be
necessary
to
herself
,
that
she
should
want
him
to
play
at
piquet
of
an
evening
,
while
Miss
Dashwood
be
above
with
her
sister
,
&
c.
she
urge
him
so
strongly
to
remain
,
that
he
,
who
be
gratify
the
first
wish
of
his
own
heart
by
a
compliance
,
could
not
long
even
affect
to
demur
;
especially
as
Mrs.
Jennings
's
entreaty
be
warmly
second
by
Mr.
Palmer
,
who
seem
to
feel
a
relief
to
himself
,
in
leave
behind
him
a
person
so
well
able
to
assist
or
advise
Miss
Dashwood
in
any
emergence
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
be
,
of
course
,
keep
in
ignorance
of
all
these
arrangement
.
<EOS>
She
know
not
that
she
have
be
the
mean
of
send
the
owner
of
Cleveland
away
,
in
about
seven
day
from
the
time
of
their
arrival
.
<EOS>
It
give
her
no
surprise
that
she
see
nothing
of
Mrs.
Palmer
;
and
as
it
give
her
likewise
no
concern
,
she
never
mention
her
name
.
  
<EOS>
two
day
pass
away
from
the
time
of
Mr.
Palmer
's
departure
,
and
her
situation
continue
,
with
little
variation
,
the
same
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Harris
,
who
attend
her
every
day
,
still
talk
boldly
of
a
speedy
recovery
,
and
Miss
Dashwood
be
equally
sanguine
;
but
the
expectation
of
the
other
be
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
cheerful
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
have
determine
very
early
in
the
seizure
that
Marianne
would
never
get
over
it
,
and
Colonel
Brandon
,
who
be
chiefly
of
use
in
listen
to
Mrs.
Jennings
's
foreboding
,
be
not
in
a
state
of
mind
to
resist
their
influence
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
reason
himself
out
of
fear
,
which
the
different
judgment
of
the
apothecary
seem
to
render
absurd
;
but
the
many
hour
of
each
day
in
which
he
be
leave
entirely
alone
,
be
but
too
favourable
for
the
admission
of
every
melancholy
idea
,
and
he
could
not
expel
from
his
mind
the
persuasion
that
he
should
see
Marianne
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
however
,
the
gloomy
anticipation
of
both
be
almost
do
away
;
for
when
Mr.
Harris
arrive
,
he
declare
his
patient
materially
better
.
<EOS>
Her
pulse
be
much
strong
,
and
every
symptom
more
favourable
than
on
the
precede
visit
.
<EOS>
Elinor
,
confirm
in
every
pleasant
hope
,
be
all
cheerfulness
;
rejoice
that
in
her
letter
to
her
mother
,
she
have
pursue
her
own
judgment
rather
than
her
friend
's
,
in
make
very
light
of
the
indisposition
which
delay
them
at
Cleveland
;
and
almost
fix
on
the
time
when
Marianne
would
be
able
to
travel
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
day
do
not
close
so
auspiciously
as
it
begin
.
<EOS>
towards
the
evening
Marianne
become
ill
again
,
grow
more
heavy
,
restless
,
and
uncomfortable
than
before
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
,
however
,
still
sanguine
,
be
willing
to
attribute
the
change
to
nothing
more
than
the
fatigue
of
have
sit
up
to
have
her
bed
make
;
and
carefully
administer
the
cordial
prescribe
,
see
her
,
with
satisfaction
,
sink
at
last
into
a
slumber
,
from
which
she
expect
the
most
beneficial
effect
.
<EOS>
Her
sleep
,
though
not
so
quiet
as
Elinor
wish
to
see
it
,
last
a
considerable
time
;
and
anxious
to
observe
the
result
of
it
<EOS>
herself
,
she
resolve
to
sit
with
her
during
the
whole
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
,
know
nothing
of
any
change
in
the

go
unusually
early
to
bed
;

who

of
the
principal
nurse

be
recreate
herself
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
,
and
Elinor
remain
alone
with
Marianne
.
  
<EOS>
the
repose
of
the
latter
become
more
and
more
disturbed
;
and
her
sister
,
who
watch
,
with
unremitte
attention
her
continual
change
of
posture
,
and
hear
the
frequent
but
inarticulate
sound
of
complaint
which
pass
her
lip
,
be
almost
wish
to
rouse
her
from
so
painful
<EOS>
a
slumber
,
when
Marianne
,
suddenly
awaken
by
some
accidental
noise
in
the
house
,
start
hastily
up
,
and
,
with
feverish
wildness

cry
out

not

conceal
her
terror

Marianne
to
lie
down
again

but
she
will
be
here
,
I
hope
,
before
it
be
long

<EOS>
It
be
a
great
way

you

from
hence
to
Barton

but
she
must
not

"
I
shall

<EOS>
Elinor
perceive
with
alarm
that
she

not
quite
herself

and
,
while
attempt
to
soothe
her
,
eagerly
feel
her
pulse
.
<EOS>
It
be
low
and
quicker
than
ever

<EOS>
and
Marianne

wildly
of
mama

her
alarm
increase
so
rapidly

as

determine
her
on

instantly
for
Mr.

<EOS>
to

Colonel
Brandon
on
the
good

the
latter

its
performance

and
as
soon
she

ring
up
the
maid
to
take
her
place
by
her
sister

she
hasten
down
to
the
drawing

<EOS>
It

no
time
for
hesitation

<EOS>
Her
fear
and
her
difficulty
be
immediately
before
him
.
<EOS>
Her
fear
,
he
have
no
courage
,
no
confidence
to
attempt
the
removal
of
;
he
listen
to
them
in
silent
despondence
;
but
her
difficulty
be
instantly
obviate

for
with
a
readiness
that
seem
to
speak
the
occasion

and
the
service

Mrs.

Elinor

no

<EOS>
She
thank
him
with
brief
,
though
fervent
gratitude
,
and
while
he
go

off
his
servant
with
a
message
to
Mr.

,
and
an
order
for
post

line
to
her

<EOS>
the
comfort

such
a

at
that
moment
as
Colonel
Brandon
 
or
such
a
companion
for
her

how
gratefully

<EOS>
a
companion
whose
judgment
would
guide
,
whose
attendance
must
relieve
,
and
whose
friendship
may
soothe
her
!
 
<EOS>
as
far
as
the
shock
of
such
a
summon
_
could
_
be
lessen
to
her

his
presence

his
manner

He

every

arrangement
with

exactness
the

<EOS>
not

<EOS>
the
horse
arrive

even
before
they
be

,
and
Colonel
Brandon
only
press
her
hand
with
a
look
of
solemnity
,
and
a
few
word
speak
too
low
to
reach
her
ear
,
hurry
into
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
about
twelve
o'clock
,
and
she
return
to
her
sister
's
apartment
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
the
apothecary
,
and
to
watch
by
her
the
rest
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
night
of
almost
equal
suffering
to
both
.
<EOS>
hour
after
hour
pass
away
in
sleepless
pain
and
delirium
on
Marianne
's
side
,
and
in
the
most
cruel
anxiety
on
Elinor
's
,
before
Mr.
Harris
appear
.
<EOS>
Her
apprehension
once
raise
,
pay
by
their
excess
for
all
her
former
security
;
and
the
servant
who
sit
up
with
her
,
for
she
would
not
allow
Mrs.
Jennings
to
be
call
,
only
torture
her
more
,
by
hint
of
what
her
mistress
have
always
think
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
's
idea
be
still
,
at
interval
,
fix
incoherently
on
her
mother
,
and
whenever
she
mention
her
name
,
it
give
a
pang
to
the
heart
of
poor
Elinor
,
who
,
reproach
herself
for
have
trifle
with
so
many
day
of
illness
,
and
wretche
for
some
immediate
relief
,
<EOS>
fancy
that
all
relief
may
soon
be
in
vain
,
that
every
thing
have
be
delay
too
long
,
and
picture
to
herself
her
suffer
mother
arrive
too
late
to
see
this
darle
child
,
or
to
see
her
rational
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
on
the
point
of
send
again
for
Mr.
Harris
,
or
if
_
he
_
could
not
come
,
for
some
other
advice
,
when
the
former
 
but
not
till
after
five
o'clock
 
arrive
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
,
however
,
make
some
little
amend
for
his
delay
,
for
though
acknowledge
a
very
unexpected
and
unpleasant
alteration
in
his
patient
,
he
would
not
allow
the
danger
to
be
material
,
and
talk
of
the
relief
which
a
fresh
mode
of
treatment
must
procure
,
with
a
confidence
which
,
in
a
less
degree
,
be
communicate
to
Elinor
.
<EOS>
He
promise
to
call
again
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
hour
,
and
leave
both
the
patient
and
her
anxious
attendant
more
composed
than
he
have
find
them
.
  
<EOS>
with
strong
concern
,
and
with
many
reproach
for
not
be
call
to
their
aid
,
do
Mrs.
Jennings
hear
in
the
morning
of
what
have
pass
.
<EOS>
Her
former
apprehension
,
now
with
great
reason
restore
,
leave
her
no
doubt
of
the
event
;
and
though
try
to
speak
comfort
to
Elinor
,
her
conviction
of
her
sister
's
danger
would
not
allow
her
to
offer
the
comfort
of
hope
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
really
grieve
.
<EOS>
the
rapid
decay
,
the
early
death
of
a
girl
so
young
,
so
lovely
as
Marianne
,
must
have
strike
a
less
interested
person
with
concern
.
<EOS>
on
Mrs.
Jennings
's
compassion
she
have
other
claim
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
for
three
month
her
companion
,
be
still
under
her
care
,
and
she
be
know
to
have
be
greatly
injure
,
and
long
unhappy
.
<EOS>
the
distress
of
her
sister
too
,
particularly
a
favourite
,
be
before
her
;
 
and
as
for
their
mother
,
when
Mrs.
Jennings
consider
that
Marianne
may
probably
be
to
_
her
_
<EOS>
what
Charlotte
be
to
herself
,
her
sympathy
in
_
<EOS>
her
_
suffering
be
very
sincere
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Harris
be
punctual
in
his
second
visit
;
but
he
come
to
be
disappoint
in
his
hope
of
what
the
last
would
produce
.
<EOS>
His
medicine
have
fail
;
the
fever
be
unabated
;
and
Marianne
only
more
quiet
 
not
more
herself
 
remain
in
a
heavy
stupor
.
<EOS>
Elinor
,
catch
all
,
and
more
than
all
,
his
fear
in
a
moment
,
propose
to
call
in
further
advice
.
<EOS>
but
he
judge
it
unnecessary
:
he
have
still
something
more
to
try
,
some
more
fresh
application
,
of
whose
success
he
be
as
confident
as
the
last
,
and
his
visit
conclude
with
encouraging
assurance
which
reach
the
ear
,
but
could
not
enter
the
heart
of
Miss
Dashwood
.
<EOS>
She
be
calm
,
except
when
she
think
of
her
mother
;
but
she
be
almost
hopeless
;
and
in
this
state
she
continue
till
noon
,
scarcely
stir
from
her
sister
's
bed
,
her
thought
wander
from
one
image
of
grief
,
one
suffer
friend
to
another
,
and
her
spirit
oppress
to
the
utmost
by
the
conversation
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
who
scruple
not
to
attribute
the
severity
and
danger
of
this
attack
to
the
many
week
of
previous
indisposition
which
Marianne
's
disappointment
have
bring
on
.
<EOS>
Elinor
feel
all
the
reasonableness
of
the
idea
,
and
it
give
fresh
misery
to
her
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
about
noon
,
however
,
she
begin
 
but
with
a
caution
 
a
dread
of
disappointment
which
for
some
time
keep
her
silent
,
even
to
her
friend
 
to
fancy
,
to
hope
she
could
perceive
a
slight
amendment
in
her
sister
's
pulse
;
she
wait
,
watch
,
and
examine
it
again
and
again
;
and
at
last
,
with
an
agitation
more
difficult
to
bury
under
exterior
calmness
,
than
all
her
foregoing
distress
,
venture
to
communicate
her
hope
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
,
though
force
,
on
examination
,
to
acknowledge
a
temporary
revival
,
try
to
keep
her
young
friend
from
indulge
a
thought
of
its
continuance
;
and
Elinor
,
con
over
every
injunction
of
distrust
,
tell
herself
likewise
not
to
hope
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
Hope
have
already
enter
;
and
feel
all
its
anxious
flutter
,
she
bend
over
her
sister
to
watch
 
she
hardly
know
for
what
.
<EOS>
half
an
hour
pass
away
,
and
the
favourable
symptom
yet
bless
her
.
<EOS>
other
even
arise
to
confirm
it
.
<EOS>
Her
breath
,
her
skin
,
her
lip
,
all
flatter
Elinor
with
sign
of
amendment
;
and
Marianne
fix
her
eye
on
her
with
a
rational
,
though
languid
,
gaze
.
<EOS>
anxiety
and
hope
now
oppress
her
in
equal
degree
,
and
leave
her
no
moment
of
tranquillity
till
the
arrival
of
Mr.
Harris
at
four
o'clock
;
when
his
assurance
,
his
felicitation
on
a
recovery
in
her
sister
even
surpass
his
expectation
,
give
her
confidence
,
comfort
,
and
tear
of
joy
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
be
in
every
respect
materially
well
,
and
he
declare
her
entirely
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
,
perhaps
satisfied
with
the
partial
justification
of
her
foreboding
which
have
be
find
in
their
late
alarm
,
allow
herself
to
trust
in
his
judgment
,
and
admit
,
with
unfeigned
joy
,
and
soon
with
unequivocal
cheerfulness
,
the
probability
of
an
entire
recovery
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
could
not
be
cheerful
.
<EOS>
Her
joy
be
of
a
different
kind
,
and
lead
to
any
thing
rather
than
to
gaiety
.
<EOS>
Marianne
restore
to
life
,
health
,
friend
,
and
to
her
dote
mother
,
be
an
idea
to
fill
her
heart
with
sensation
of
exquisite
comfort
,
and
expand
it
in
fervent
gratitude
;
 
but
it
lead
to
no
outward
demonstration
of
joy
,
no
word
,
no
smile

<EOS>
all
within
Elinor
's
breast
be
satisfaction
,
silent
and
strong
.
  
<EOS>
She
continue
by
the
side
of
her
sister
,
with
little
intermission
the
whole
afternoon
,
calm
every
fear
,
satisfy
every
inquiry
of
her
enfeeble
spirit
,
supply
every
succour
,
and
watch
almost
every
look
and
every
breath
.
<EOS>
the
possibility
of
a
relapse
would
of
course
,
in
some
moment
,
occur
to
remind
her
of
what
anxiety
be
;
but
when
she
see
,
on
her
frequent
and
minute
examination
,
that
every
symptom
of
recovery
continue
,
and
see
Marianne
at
six
o'clock
sink
into
a
quiet
,
steady
,
and
to
all
appearance
comfortable
,
sleep
,
she
silence
every
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
the
time
be
now
draw
on
,
when
Colonel
Brandon
may
be
expect
back
.
<EOS>
at
ten
o'clock
,
she
trust
,
or
at
least
not
much
later
her
mother
would
be
relieve
from
the
dreadful
suspense
in
which
she
must
now
be
travel
towards
them
.
<EOS>
the
Colonel
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
perhaps
scarcely
less
an
object
of
pity
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
slow
be
the
progress
of
time
which
yet
keep
them
in
ignorance
!
  
<EOS>
at
seven
o'clock
,
leave
Marianne
still
sweetly
asleep
,
she
join
Mrs.
Jennings
in
the
drawing
-
room
to
tea
.
<EOS>
of
breakfast
she
have
be
keep
by
her
fear
,
and
of
dinner
by
their
sudden
reverse
,
from
eat
much
;
and
the
present
refreshment
,
therefore
,
with
such
feeling
of
content
as
she
bring
to
it
,
be
particularly
welcome
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
would
have
persuade
her
,
at
its
conclusion
,
to
take
some
rest
before
her
mother
's
arrival
,
and
allow
_
her
_
to
take
her
place
by
Marianne
;
but
Elinor
have
no
sense
of
fatigue
,
no
capability
of
sleep
at
that
moment
about
her
,
and
she
be
not
to
be
keep
away
from
her
sister
an
unnecessary
instant
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
therefore
attend
her
up
stair
into
the
sick
chamber
,
to
satisfy
herself
that
all
continue
right
,
leave
her
there
again
to
her
charge
and
her
thought
,
and
retire
to
her
own
room
to
write
letter
and
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
the
night
be
cold
and
stormy
.
<EOS>
the
wind
roar
round
the
house
,
and
the
rain
beat
against
the
window
;
but
Elinor
,
all
happiness
within
,
regard
it
not
.
<EOS>
Marianne
sleep
through
every
blast
;
and
the
traveller
,
they
have
a
rich
reward
in
store
,
for
every
present
inconvenience
.
  
<EOS>
the
clock
strike
eight
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
ten
,
Elinor
would
have
be
convince
that
at
that
moment
she
hear
a
carriage
drive
up
to
the
house
;
and
so
strong
be
the
persuasion
that
she
_
do
_
,
in
spite
of
the
_
almost
_
impossibility
of
their
be
already
come
,
that
she
move
into
the
adjoining
dressing
-
closet
and
open
a
window
shutter
,
to
be
satisfy
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
see
that
her
ear
have
not
deceive
her
.
<EOS>
the
flare
lamp
of
a
carriage
be
immediately
in
view
.
<EOS>
by
their
uncertain
light
she
think
she
could
discern
it
to
be
draw
by
four
horse
;
and
this
,
while
it
tell
the
excess
of
her
poor
mother
's
alarm
,
give
some
explanation
to
such
unexpected
rapidity
.
  
<EOS>
never
in
her
life
have
Elinor
find
it
so
difficult
to
be
calm
,
as
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
the
knowledge
of
what
her
mother
must
be
feel
as
the
carriage
stop
the
door
,
 
of
her
doubt
 
her
dread
,
 
perhaps
her
despair
!
 
<EOS>
and
of
what
_
she
_
have
to
tell
!
<EOS>
with
such
knowledge
it
be
impossible
to
be
calm
.
<EOS>
all
that
remain
to
be
do
be
to
be
speedy
;
and
,
therefore
stay
only
till
she
could
leave
Mrs.
Jennings
's
maid
with
her
sister
,
she
hurry
down
stair
.
  
<EOS>
the
bustle
in
the
vestibule
,
as
she
pass
along
an
inner
lobby
,
assure
her
that
they
be
already
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
rush
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
 
she
enter
it
,
 
and
see
only
Willoughby
.
    
<EOS>
Elinor
,
start
back
with
a
look
of
horror
at
the
sight
of
him
,
obey
the
first
impulse
of
her
heart
in
turn
instantly
to
quit
the
room
,
and
her
hand
be
already
on
the
lock
,
when
its
action
be
suspend
by
his
hastily
advance
,
and
say
,
in
a
voice
rather
of
command
than
supplication
    
"
Miss
Dashwood
,
for
half
an
hour
 
for
ten
minute
 
I
entreat
you

have
they
tell
me
,

he
cry
with
vehemence

that
Mr.
Palmer

all
his

it

me
from

My

<EOS>
in
the
utmost
amazement
;

quick

if
you

less
violent

<EOS>

down

I
will
be
both

<EOS>
She
hesitate
;
she
know
not
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
the
possibility
of
Colonel
Brandon
's
arrive
and
find
her
there
,
come
across
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
promise
to
hear
him
,
and
her
curiosity
no
less
than
her
honor
be
engage
.
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
recollection
,
therefore
,
conclude
that
prudence
require
dispatch
,
and
that
her
acquiescence
would
best
promote
it
,
she
walk
silently
towards
the
table
,
and
sit
down
.
<EOS>
He
take
the
opposite
chair
,
and
for
half
a
minute
not
a
word
be
say
by
either
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
be
quick
,
sir
,
"
say
Elinor
,
impatiently
;
"
I
have
no
time
to
spare
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
sit
in
an
attitude
of
deep
meditation
,
and
seem
not
to
hear
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
,
"
say
he
,
with
abruptness
,
a
moment
afterwards
 
"
be
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
I
hear
it
from
the
servant
.
<EOS>
God
be
praise
!
 
<EOS>
but
be
it
true
?
<EOS>
be
it
really
true
?
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
would
not
speak
.
<EOS>
He
repeat
the
inquiry
with
yet
great
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
God
's
sake
tell
me
,

out

<EOS>
"
We
hope
she
be

"
  
<EOS>
He
rise
up
,
and
walk
across
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
I
know
as
much
half
an
hour
ago
 
<EOS>
but
since
I

with
a

vivacity

<EOS>
for
once

Miss
Dashwood
 
it
will
be
the

perhaps
 
let
us
be
cheerful
together
.
<EOS>
I
be
in

tell
me
honestly

his

<EOS>
Elinor
look
at
him
with
great
astonishment
than
ever
.
<EOS>
She
begin
to
think
that
he
must
be
in
liquor
;
 
the
strangeness
of
such
a
visit
,
and
of
such
manner
,
seem
no
otherwise
intelligible
;
and
with
this
impression
she
immediately
rise
,
say
    
"
Mr.
Willoughby
,
I
advise
you
at
present
to
return
to
Combe

your

it

better
recollect

explain
to

morrow

<EOS>
"
I
understand
you

he
reply
,
with
an
expressive
smile
,
and
a
voice
perfectly
calm
;
"
yes
,
I
be
very
drunk
.
<EOS>
a
pint
of
porter
with
my
cold
beef
at
Marlborough
be
enough
to
over
-
set
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
at
Marlborough
!
"
 
cry
Elinor
,
more
and
more
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
he
would
be
at
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
 
I
leave
London
this
morning
at
eight
o'clock
,
and
the
only
ten
minute
I
have
spend
out
of
my
chaise
since
that
time
procure
me
a
nuncheon
at
Marlborough

<EOS>
the
steadiness
of
his
manner
,
and
the
intelligence
of
his
eye
as
he
speak

convincing
Elinor

that
whatever
other
unpardonable
folly
may
bring
him
to
Cleveland
,
he
be
not
bring
there
by
intoxication
,
she
say
,
after
a
moment
's
recollection
    
"
Mr.
Willoughby
,
you
_
ought

to
feel
,

I
certainly

do

,
that
after
what
have
pass
 
your
coming
here
in
this
manner
,
and
force
yourself
upon
my
notice

require
a
very
particular
excuse

what
be
it

that
you
mean
by
it

<EOS>
"
I

say
he

with
serious
energy

make
you
hate
me
one
degree

<EOS>
I
mean
to
offer
some
kind
of
explanation

some
kind
of
apology
,
for
the
past

to
open
my
whole
heart
to
you
,

by
convince
you

that
though
I
have
be
always
a
blockhead
,
I
have
not
be
always
a
rascal

to
obtain
something
like
forgiveness
from
Ma

from
your
sister

this
the
real
reason

your
coming

my
soul

his
answer
,
with
a
warmth
which
bring
all
the
former
Willoughby
to
her
remembrance
,

in
spite
of
herself
make
her
think
him
sincere

if
that
be
all

you

he
cry
,
in
the

eager
tone

<EOS>
then
she
have
forgive
me
before

have
do
it

she
shall
forgive
me
again
,
and
on
more
reasonable
ground

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
now

will
you
listen
to
me
?

<EOS>
Elinor
bow
her
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
he
,
after
a
pause
of
expectation
on
her
side
,
and
thoughtfulness
on
his
own
,
"
how
_
you
_
may
have
account
for
my
behaviour
to
your
sister
,
or
what
diabolical
motive
you
may
have
impute
to
me
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
hardly
think
the
well
of
me
,
 
it
be
worth
the
trial
however
,
and
you
shall
hear
every
thing
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
become
intimate
in
your
family
,
I
have
no
other
intention

no
other
view
in
the
acquaintance
than
to
pass
my
time
pleasantly
while
I
be
oblige
to
remain
in
Devonshire
,
more
pleasantly
than
I
have
ever
do
before
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
's
lovely
person
and
interesting
manner
could
not
but
please
me
;
and
her
behaviour
to
me
almost
from
the
first
,
be
of
a
kind
 
It
be
astonishing
,
when
I
reflect
on
what
it
be
,
and
what
_
<EOS>
she
_
be
,
that
my
heart
should
have
be
so
insensible
!
<EOS>
but
at
first
I
must
confess
,
my
vanity
only
be
elevate
by
it
.
<EOS>
careless
of
her
happiness
,
think
only
of
my
own
amusement
,
give
way
to
feeling
which
I
have
always
be
too
much
in
the
habit
of
indulging
,
I
endeavour
,
by
every
mean
in
my
power

to
make
myself
pleasing
to
her

return
her
affection

<EOS>
Miss
Dashwood
,
at
this
point

turn
her
eye
on
him
with
the
most
angry
contempt
,
stop
him
,
by

"
It
be
hardly
worth

while

Mr.
Willoughby

for
you
to
relate

I
insist
on
you
hear
the
whole
of
it

"
My
fortune
be
never
large

I
have
always

expensive

always
in
the

people
of
well
income

myself

<EOS>
every
year
since
my
coming
of
age
,
or
even
before

I
believe
,
have
add
to
my
debt
;

though
the
death
of
my
old
cousin

Mrs.
Smith

be
to
set
me
free

yet
that
event
be
uncertain

possibly
far
distant

it
have
be
for
some

my

establish
my
circumstance
by
marry
a
woman
of
fortune

<EOS>
to
attach
myself
to
your

be
not

with

selfishness

cruelty

no

engage
her
regard

it

but
one
thing
may
be
say
for
me
:
even
in
that
horrid
state
of
selfish
vanity

I
do
not
know
the
extent
of
the
injury
I
meditate
,
because
I
do
not

then

know
what
it
be
to
love

have
I
ever
know
it

<EOS>
well
may
it
be
doubt
;
for

have
I
really
love
,
could
I
have
sacrifice
my
feeling
to
vanity
,
to
avarice
?
<EOS>
or
,
what
be
more
,
could
I
have
sacrifice
her
?
<EOS>
but
I
have
do
it
.
<EOS>
to
avoid
a
comparative
poverty
,
which
her
affection

her
society
would
have
deprive
of
all
its
horror

have

You

<EOS>
yes

I
find
myself
,
by
insensible
degree
,
sincerely
fond
of
her
;
and
the
happy
hour
of
my
life
be
what
I
spend
with
her
when
I
feel
my
intention
be
strictly
honourable
,
and
my
feeling
blameless

<EOS>
even
_
<EOS>
then
_
,
however
,
when
fully
determined
on
pay
my
address
to
her
,
I
allow
myself
most
improperly
to
put
off
,
from
day
to
day
,
the
moment
of
do
it
,
from
an
unwillingness
to
enter
into
an
engagement

be
so
greatly
embarrassed

I
will
not
reason
here
 
nor
will
I
stop
for
_
<EOS>
you
_
<EOS>
to
expatiate
on
the
absurdity
,
and
the
bad
than
absurdity
,
of
scruple
to
engage
my
faith
where
my
honour
be
already

prove
,
that
I
be
a
cunning
fool

with
great
circumspection
for
a
possible
opportunity
of
make
myself
contemptible
and
wretched
for
ever

<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
my
resolution
be
take
,
and
I
have
determine
,
as
soon
as
I
could
engage
her
alone
,
to
justify
the
attention
I
have
so
invariably
pay
her
,
and
openly
assure
her
of
an
affection
which
I
have
already
take
such
pain
to
display
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
interim
 
in
the
interim
of
the
very
few
hour
that
be
to
pass
,
before
I
could
have
an
opportunity
of

with

an
unlucky

to

it

and
how
you
will

dreadful

I

<EOS>
Could
it
be
an
impartial
one

<EOS>
I
acknowledge
that
her
situation
and
her
character
ought
to
have
be
respect
by
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
justify
myself
,
but
at
the

time
can
not
leave
you
to
suppose
that
I
have
nothing
to
urge
 
<EOS>
that
because
she

she
be
irreproachable
,
and
because
_
I

be

she

must
be

the
violence

weakness

do
not

defend
myself

<EOS>
Her
affection
for
me
deserve
well
treatment

I
often
,
with
great
self

reproach
,
recall
the
tenderness

for

have
the
power

I
wish

heartily
wish
it

never

but
I
have
injure
more
than

and
I
have
injure
one
,
whose
affection
for
me
 
(
may
I
say
it
?
)
be
scarcely
less
warm
than
her
;

how
infinitely
superior

"
Your
indifference
,
however
,
towards
that
unfortunate
girl
 
I
must
say
it
,
unpleasant
to
me
as
the
discussion
of
such
a
subject
may
well
be
 
<EOS>
your
indifference

no
apology

your

neglect

upon

I

he
warmly

I
do

that
I

She
tax
me
with
the
offence
at
once
,
and
my
confusion
may
be
guess
.
<EOS>
the
purity
of
her
life
,
the
formality
of
her
notion
,
her
ignorance
of
the
world
,
 
every
thing
be
against
me
.
<EOS>
the
matter
itself
I
could
not
deny
,

vain
be
every
endeavour
to
soften
it

<EOS>
She
be
previously
dispose
,
I
believe
,
to
doubt
the
morality
of
my
conduct
in
general
,
and
be
moreover
discontent
with
the
very
little
attention
,
the
very
little
portion
of
my
time
that
I
have
bestow
on
her
,
in
my
present
visit
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
end
in
a
total
breach
.
<EOS>
by
one
measure
I
may
have
save
myself
.
<EOS>
in
the
height
of
her
morality
,
good
woman
!
<EOS>
she
offer
to
forgive
the
past
,
if
I
would
marry
Eliza
.
<EOS>
that
could
not
be
;
and
I
be
formally
dismiss
from
her
favour
and
her
house
.
<EOS>
the
night
follow
this
affair
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
go
the
next
morning
 
<EOS>
be
spend
by
me
in
deliberate
on
what
my
future
conduct
should
be
.
<EOS>
the
struggle
be
great
,
but
it
end
too
soon
.
<EOS>
My
affection
for
Marianne
,
my
thorough
conviction
of
her
attachment
to
me
 
<EOS>
it
be
all
insufficient
to
outweigh
that
dread
of
poverty
,
or
get
the
well
of
those
false
idea
of
the
necessity
of
rich
,
which
I
be
naturally
inclined
to
feel
,
and
expensive
society
have
increase
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
believe
myself
secure
of
my
present
wife
,
if
I
choose
to
address
her
,
and
I
persuade
myself
to
think
that
nothing
else
in
common
prudence
remain
for
me
to
do
.
<EOS>
a
heavy
scene
however
await
me
,
before
I
could
leave
Devonshire
:
I
be
engage
to
dine
with
you
on
that
very
day
;
some
apology
be
therefore
necessary
for
my
breaking
this
engagement
.
<EOS>
but
whether
I
should
write
this
apology
,
or
deliver
it
in
person
,
be
a
point
of
long
debate
.
<EOS>
to
see
Marianne
,
I
feel
,
would
be
dreadful
,
and
I
even
doubt
whether
I
could
see
her
again
,
and
keep
to
my
resolution
.
<EOS>
in
that
point
,
however
,
I
undervalue
my
own
magnanimity
,
as
the
event
declare
;
for
I
go
,
I
see
her
,
and
see
her
miserable
,
and
leave
her
miserable
;
 
and
leave
her
hope
never
to
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
call
,
Mr.
Willoughby
?
"

Elinor
,
reproachfully
;

a
note
would
have
answer
every
purpose

why
be
it
necessary
to
call
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
necessary
to
my
own
pride
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
leave
the
country
in
a
manner
that
may
lead
you
,
or
the
rest
of
the
neighbourhood
,
to
suspect
any
part
of
what
have
really
pass
between
Mrs.
Smith
and
myself
,
and
I
resolve
therefore
on
call
at
the
cottage
,
in
my
way
to
Honiton
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
your
dear
sister
,
however
,
be
really
dreadful
;
and
,
to
heighten
the
matter
,
I
find
her
alone
.
<EOS>
You
be
all
go
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
where
.
<EOS>
I
have
leave
her
only
the
evening
before
,
so
fully
,
so
firmly
resolve
within
my
self
on
do
right
!
<EOS>
a
few
hour
be
to
have
engage
her
to
me
for
ever
;
and
I
remember
how
happy
,
how
gay
be
my
spirit
,
as
I
walk
from
the
cottage
to
Allenham
,
satisfied
with
myself
,
delighted
with
every
body
!
<EOS>
but
in
this
,
our
last
interview
of
friendship
,
I
approach
her
with
a
sense
of
guilt
that
almost
take
from
me
the
power
of
dissemble
.
<EOS>
Her
sorrow
,
her
disappointment
,
her
deep
regret
,
when
I
tell
her
that
I
be
oblige
to
leave
Devonshire
<EOS>
so
immediately
 
I
never
shall
forget
it
 
unite
too
with
such
reliance
,
<EOS>
such
confidence
in
me
!
<EOS>
oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
what
a
hard
-
hearted
rascal
I
be
!

<EOS>
They
be
both
silent
for
a
few
moment
.
<EOS>
Elinor
first
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
tell
her
that
you
should
soon
return
?

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
I
tell
her

he
reply
,
impatiently
;
"
less
than
be
due
to
the
past

beyond
a
doubt

in
all
likelihood
much
more
than

by
the
future

I
can
not

of
it

not

your

Heaven

<EOS>
Miss
Dashwood
,
you
can
not
have
an
idea
of
the
comfort
it
give
me
to
look
back
on
my
own
misery
.
<EOS>
I
owe
such
a
grudge
to
myself
for
the
stupid
,
rascally
folly
of
my
own
heart
,
that
all
my
past
suffering
under
it
be
only
triumph
and
exultation
to
me
now

awaken

have
in

quiet
it

at

,
judge
it
wise
to
affect
the

common
acquaintance

John
,
I
believe
,
the
first
day
of
his
coming
,
and
the
day
after
I
have
call
at
Mrs.
Jennings
's
.
<EOS>
He
ask
me
to
a
party
,
a
dance
at
his
house
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
have
he
_
not
<EOS>
_
tell
me
as
an
inducement
that
you
and
your
sister
be
to
be
there
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
feel
it
too
certain
a
thing
,
to
trust
myself
near
him
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
bring
another
short
note
from
Marianne
 
still
affectionate
,
open
,
artless
,
confide
 
everything
that
could
make
_
my
_
conduct
most
hateful
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
answer
it
.
<EOS>
I
try
 
but
could
not
frame
a
sentence
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
of
her
,
I
believe
,
every
moment
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
if
you
_
can
_
pity
me
,
<EOS>
Miss
Dashwood
,
pity
my
situation
as
it
be
_
then
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
with
my
head
and
heart
full
of
your
sister
,
I
be
force
to
play
the
happy
lover
to
another
woman
!
<EOS>
those
three
or
four
week
be
bad
than
all
.
<EOS>
well
,
at
last
,
as
I
need
not
tell
you
,
you
be
force
on
me
;
and
what
a
sweet
figure
I
cut
!
<EOS>
what
an
evening
of
agony
it
be
!
<EOS>
Marianne
,
beautiful
as
an
angel
on
one
side
,
call
me
Willoughby
in
such
a
tone
!
<EOS>
oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
hold
out
her
hand
to
me
,
ask
me
for
an
explanation
,
with
those
bewitch
eye
fix
in
such
speak
solicitude
on
my
face
!
<EOS>
and
Sophia
,
jealous
as
the
devil
on
the
other
hand
,
look
all
that
be
 
<EOS>
well
,
it
do
not
signify
;
it
be
over
now
.
<EOS>
such
an
evening
!
<EOS>
I
run
away
from
you
all
as
soon
as
I
could
;
but
not
before
I
have
see
Marianne
's
sweet
face
as
white
as
death
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
be
<EOS>
the
last
,
last
look
<EOS>
I
ever
have
of
her
;
the
last
manner
in
which
she
appear
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
horrid
sight
!
<EOS>
yet
when
I
think
of
her
to
-
day
as
really
die
,
it
be
a
kind
of
comfort
to
me
to
imagine
that
I
know
exactly
how
she
would
appear
to
those
,
who
see
her
last
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
She
be
before
me
,
constantly
before
me
,
as
I
travel
,
in
the
same
look
and
hue
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
short
pause
of
mutual
thoughtfulness
succeed
.
<EOS>
Willoughby
first
rouse
himself
,
break
it
thus
:
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
let
me
make
haste
and
be
go
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
be
certainly
well
,
certainly
out
of
danger
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
assure
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
poor
mother
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
dote
on
Marianne
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
the
letter
,
Mr.
Willoughby
,
your
own
letter
;
have
you
any
thing
to
say
about
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
_
that
_
in
particular
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
write
to
me
again
,
you
know
,
the
very
next
morning
.
<EOS>
You
see
what
she
say
.
<EOS>
I
be
breakfast
at
the
Ellisons
,
 
and
her
letter
,
with
some
other
,
be
bring
to
me
there
from
my
lodging
.
<EOS>
It
happen
to
catch
Sophia
's
eye
before
it
catch
mine
;
 
and
its
size
,
the
elegance
of
the
paper
,
the
hand
-
writing
altogether
,
immediately
give
her
a
suspicion
.
<EOS>
some
vague
report
have
reach
her
before
of
my
attachment
to
some
young
lady
in
Devonshire
,
and
what
have
pass
within
her
observation
the
precede
evening
have
mark
who
the
young
lady
be
,
and
make
her
more
jealous
than
ever
.
<EOS>
affect
that
air
of
playfulness
,
therefore
,
which
be
delightful
in
a
woman
one
love
,
she
open
the
letter
directly
,
and
read
its
content
.
<EOS>
She
be
well
pay
for
her
impudence
.
<EOS>
She
read
what
make
her
wretched
.
<EOS>
Her
wretchedness
I
could
have
bear
,
but
her
passion
 
her
malice
 
at
all
event
it
must
be
appease
.
<EOS>
and
,
in
short
,
what
do
you
think
of
my
wife
's
style
of
letter
-
writing
?
 
<EOS>
delicate
 
tender
 
truly
feminine
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Your
wife
!
<EOS>
the
letter
be
in
your
own
hand
-
writing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
I
have
only
the
credit
of
servilely
copy
such
sentence
as
I
be
ashamed
to
put
my
name
to
.
<EOS>
the
original
be
all
her
own
 
her
own
happy
thought
and
gentle
diction
.
<EOS>
but
what
could
I
do
!
<EOS>
we
be
engage
,
every
thing
in
preparation
,
the
day
almost
fix
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
talk
like
a
fool
.
<EOS>
preparation
!
<EOS>
Day
!
<EOS>
in
honest
word
,
her
money
be
necessary
to
me
,
and
in
a
situation
like
mine
,
any
thing
be
to
be
do
to
prevent
a
rupture
.
<EOS>
and
after
all
,
what
do
it
signify
to
my
character
in
the
opinion
of
Marianne
and
her
friend
,
in
what
language
my
answer
be
couch
?
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
only
to
one
end
.
<EOS>
My
business
be
to
declare
myself
a
scoundrel
,
and
whether
I
do
it
with
a
bow
or
a
bluster
be
of
little
importance
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
ruin
for
ever
in
their
opinion
,
"
say
I
to
myself
;
"
I
be
shut
out
for
ever
from
their
society
,
they
already
think
me
an
unprincipled
fellow
,
this
letter
will
only
make
them
think
me
a
blackguard
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
be
my
reasoning
,
as
,
in
a
sort
of
desperate
carelessness
<EOS>
,
I
copy
my
wife
's
word
,
and
part
with
the
last
relic
of
Marianne
.
<EOS>
Her
three
note
 
unluckily
they
be
all
in
my
pocket
-
book
,
or
I
should
have
deny
their
existence
,
and
hoard
them
for
ever
 
<EOS>
I
be
force
to
put
them
up
,
and
could
not
even
kiss
them
.
<EOS>
and
the
lock
of
hair
 
that
too
I
have
always
carry
about
me
in
the
same
pocket
-
book
,
which
be
now
search
by
Madam
with
the
most
ingratiate
virulence
,
 
the
dear
lock
 
all
,
every
memento
be
tear
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
wrong
,
Mr.
Willoughby
,
very
blamable
,
"
say
Elinor
,
while
her
voice
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
betray
her
compassionate
emotion
;
"
you
ought
not
to
speak
in
this
way
,
either
of
Mrs.
Willoughby
or
my
sister
.
<EOS>
You
have
make
your
own
choice
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
force
on
you

<EOS>
Your
wife
have
a
claim
to
your
politeness
,
to
your
respect
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
attach
to
you
,
or
she
would
not
have
marry
you
.
<EOS>
to
treat
her
with
unkindness
,
to
speak
of
her
slightingly
be
no
atonement
to
Marianne
 
nor
can
I
suppose
it
a
relief
to
your
own
conscience
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
talk
to
me
of
my
wife
,
"
say
he
with
a
heavy
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
She
do
not
deserve
your
compassion
.
<EOS>
She
know
I
have
no
regard
for
her
when
we
marry
.
<EOS>
well
,
married
we
be
,
and
come
down
to
Combe
Magna
to
be
happy
,
and
afterwards
return
to
town
to
be
gay
.
<EOS>
and
now
do
you
pity
me
,
Miss
Dashwood
?
<EOS>
or
have
I
say
all
this
to
no
purpose
?
<EOS>
be
I
,
 
<EOS>
be
it
only
one
degree
<EOS>
,
 
be
I
less
guilty
in
your
opinion
than
I
be
before
?
<EOS>
My
intention
be
not
always
wrong
.
<EOS>
have
I
explain
away
any
part
of
my
guilt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
you
have
certainly
remove
something
 
a
little
.
<EOS>
You
have
prove
yourself
,
on
the
whole
,
less
faulty
than
I
have
believe
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
prove
your
heart
less
wicked
,
much
less
wicked
.
<EOS>
but
I
hardly
know
 
the
misery
that
you
have
inflict
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
could
have
make
it
bad

Will
you
repeat
to
your
sister
when
she
be
recover
,
what
I
have
be
tell
you
?
 
<EOS>
let
me
be
a
little
lighten
too
in
her
opinion
as
well
as
in
yours
.
<EOS>
You
tell
me
that
she
have
forgive
me
already

<EOS>
let
me
be
able
to
fancy
that
a
well
knowledge
of
my
heart
,
and
of
my
present
feeling

will
draw
from
her
a
more
spontaneous
,
more
natural
,
more
gentle
,
less
dignified
,
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
tell
her
of
my
misery

my
penitence
 
tell
her
that
my
heart
be
never
inconstant
to
her

and
if
you
will
,
that
at
this
moment
she
be
dearer
to
me

I
will
tell
her
all
that

you

last
night
,
in
Drury
Lane
lobby

I
run
against
Sir
John
Middleton

he
speak

me
ever

I
have

without

now

however

his
good

natured

honest
,
stupid
soul
,
full
of
indignation
against
me

and
concern
for
your
sister

could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
tell
me
what
he
know
ought
to
,
though
probably
he
do
not
think
it
_
would
_
,
vex
me
horridly

<EOS>
as
bluntly
as
he
could
speak
it
,
therefore
,
he
tell
me
that
Marianne

be
die
of
a
putrid
fever
at
Cleveland
 
a
letter

danger
most
imminent
 
the
Palmers

all
go
off
in
a
fright

<EOS>
I
be
too
much
shocked
to
be
able
to
pass
myself
off
as
insensible
even
to
the
undiscerning
Sir
John

<EOS>
His
heart
be
soften
in
see
mine
suffer

and
so
much
of
his
ill

will
be
do
away
,
that
when
we
part
,
he
almost
shake
me
by
the
hand
while
he
remind
me
of
an
old

about
a
pointer
puppy

<EOS>
what
I

Her

the
irreparable

too
early
an

its

dissipation

prove
a
source
of
unhappiness
to
himself

for

as

Willoughby
,
in
spite
of
all
his
fault
,
excite
a
degree
of
commiseration
for
the
suffering
produce
by
them
,
which
make
her
think
of
him
as
now
separate
for
ever
from
her
family
,
with
a
tenderness
,
a
regret
,
rather
in
proportion
,
as
she
soon
acknowledge
within
herself
 
to
his
wish
than
to
his
merit

<EOS>
She
feel
that
his
influence
over
her
mind
be
heighten
by
circumstance
which
ought
not
in
reason
to
have
weight
;
by
that
person
of
uncommon
attraction
,
that
open
,
affectionate
,
and
lively
manner
which
it
be
no
merit
to
possess
;
and
by
that
still
ardent
love
for
Marianne
,
which
it
be
not
even
innocent
to
indulge
.

but
she
feel
that
it
be
so
,
long
,
long
before
she
could
feel
his
influence
less
.
  
<EOS>
when
at
last
she
return
to
the
unconscious
Marianne
,
she
find
her
just
awake
,
refresh
by
so
long
and
sweet
a
sleep
to
the
extent
of
her
hope

the

present

the
future
,
Willoughby
's
visit
,
Marianne
's
safety
,
and
her
mother
's
expect
arrival
,
throw
her
altogether
into
an
agitation
of
spirit
which
keep
off
every
indication
of
fatigue
,
and
make
her
only
fearful
of
betray
herself
to
her

Short
be
the
time

in

Mrs.
Dashwood
,
whose
terror
as
they
draw
near
the
house
have
produce
almost
the
conviction
of
Marianne
's
be
no
more
,
have
no
voice
to
inquire
after
her
,
no
voice
even
for
Elinor
;
but
_
she
_
,
wait
neither
for
salutation
nor
inquiry

instantly
give
the
joyful
relief
;

her

catch
it
with
all
her
usual
warmth
,
be
in
a
moment
as
much
overcome
by

happiness

as

fear

She
be
support
into
the
drawing

room
between
her

and
there
,
shed
tear
of
joy
,
though
still
unable
to
speak
,
embrace
Elinor
again
and
again
,
turn
from
her
at
interval
to
press
Colonel
Brandon
's
hand
,
with
a
look
which
speak
at
once
her
gratitude
,
and
her
conviction
of
his
sharing
with
herself
in
the
bliss
of
the
moment

<EOS>
He
share
it
,
however
,
in
a
silence
even
great
than
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Mrs.
Dashwood
have
recover
herself
,
to
see
Marianne
be
her
first
desire
;
and
in
two
minute
she
be
with
her
beloved
child
,
render
dearer
to
her
than
ever
by
absence
,
unhappiness
,
and
danger
.
<EOS>
Elinor
's
delight
,
as
she
see
what
each
feel
in
the
meeting
,
be
only
check
by
an
apprehension
of
its
robbing
Marianne
of
farth
sleep
;
 
but
Mrs.
Dashwood
could
be
calm
,
could
be
even
prudent
,
when
the
life
of
a
child
be
at
stake
,
and
Marianne
,
satisfied
in
know
her
mother
be
near
her
,
and
conscious
of
be
too
weak
for
conversation
,
submit
readily
to
the
silence
and
quiet
prescribed
by
every
nurse
around
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
_
would
_
sit
up
with
her
all
night
;
and
Elinor
,
in
compliance
with
her
mother
's
entreaty
,
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
but
the
rest
,
which
one
night
entirely
sleepless
,
and
many
hour
of
the
most
wear
anxiety
seem
to
make
requisite

be
keep
off

irritation

<EOS>
Willoughby
,
"
poor
Willoughby
,
"
as
she
now
allow
herself
to
call
him
,
be
constantly
in
her
thought
;
she
would
not
but
have
hear
his
vindication
for
the
world
,
and
now
blame
,
now
acquit
herself
for
have
judge
him
so
harshly
before
.
<EOS>
but
her
promise
of
relate
it
to
her
sister
be
invariably
painful
.
<EOS>
She
dread
the
performance
of
it
,
dread
what
its
effect
on
Marianne
may
be
;
doubt
whether
after
such
an
explanation
she
could
ever
be
happy
with
another
;
and
for
a
moment
wish
Willoughby
a
widower
.
<EOS>
then
,
remember
Colonel
Brandon
,
reprove
herself
,
feel
that
to
_
his
_
suffering
and
_
his
_
constancy
far
more
than
to
his
rival
's
,
the
reward
of
her
sister
be
due
,
and
wish
any
thing
rather
than
Mrs.
Willoughby
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
the
shock
of
Colonel
Brandon
's
errand
at
Barton
have
be
much
soften
to
Mrs.
Dashwood
by
her
own
previous
alarm
;
for
so
great
be
her
uneasiness
about
Marianne
,
that
she
have
already
determine
to
set
out
for
Cleveland
on
that
very
day
,
without
wait
for
any
further
intelligence
,
and
have
so
far
settle
her
journey
before
his
arrival
,
that
the
Careys
be
then
expect
every
moment
to
fetch
Margaret
away
,
as
her
mother
be
unwilling
to
take
her
where
there
may
be
infection
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
continue
to
mend
every
day
,
and
the
brilliant
cheerfulness
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
look
and
spirit
prove
her
to
be
,
as
she
repeatedly
declare
herself
,
one
of
the
happy
woman
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Elinor
could
not
hear
the
declaration
,
nor
witness
its
proof
without
sometimes
wonder
whether
her
mother
ever
recollect
Edward
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
trust
to
the
temperate
account
of
her
own
disappointment
which
Elinor
have
send
her
,
be
lead
away
by
the
exuberance
of
her
joy
to
think
only
of
what
would
increase
it
.
<EOS>
Marianne
be
restore
to
her
from
a
danger
in
which
,
as
she
now
begin
to
feel
,
her
own
mistaken
judgment
in
encourage
the
unfortunate
attachment
to
Willoughby
,
have
contribute
to
place
her
;
and
in
her
recovery
she
have
yet
another
source
of
joy
unthought
of
by
Elinor
.
<EOS>
It
be
thus
impart
to
her
,
as
soon
as
any
opportunity
of
private
conference
between
them
occur
.
  
<EOS>
"
at

You

I

down

I
believe
Marianne

most
happy

him

the
two

"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
be
half
inclined
to
ask
her
reason
for
think
so
,
because
satisfied
that
none
found
on
an
impartial
consideration
of
their
age
,
character
,
or
feeling
,
could
be
give
;
 
but
her
mother
must
always
be
carry
away
by
her
imagination
on
any
interesting
subject
,
and
therefore
instead
of
an
inquiry
,
she
pass
it
off
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
open
his
whole
heart
to
me
yesterday
as
we

It
come
out
quite
unawares

quite
undesignedly

<EOS>
I
,
you
may
well
believe
,
could
talk
of
nothing
but
my
child
;
 
he
could
not
conceal
his
distress
;
I
see
that
it
equal
my
own
,
and
he
perhaps
,
think
that
mere
friendship
,
as
the
world
now
go
,
would
not
justify
so
warm
a
sympathy
 
or
rather
,
not
think
at
all

I
suppose
 
give
way
to
irresistible
feeling

me
acquaint

his
earnest

tender

my
Elinor

ever

the
first

her

"
  
<EOS>
here
,
however
,
Elinor
perceive
,
 
not
the
language
,
not
the
profession
of
Colonel
Brandon
,
but
the
natural
embellishment
of
her
mother
's
active
fancy
,
which
fashion
every
thing
delightful
to
her
as
it
choose
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
regard
for

infinitely
surpass
anything
that
Willoughby

feign

as
much
more
warm

as
more
sincere

constant
,

His

do
not

what

do
you
give
him

<EOS>
do
you
allow

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
love

I
could

<EOS>
Marianne
may
at
that
moment
be
die
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
ask
for
hope
or
encouragement
.
<EOS>
His
be
an
involuntary
confidence
,
an
irrepressible
effusion
to
a
soothing
friend
,
not
an
application
to
a
parent
.
<EOS>
yet
after
a
time
I
_
do
_
say
,
for
at
first
I
be
quite
overcome
,
that
if
she
live
,
as
I
trust
she
may
,
my
great
happiness
would
lie
in
promote
their
marriage
;
and
since
our
arrival
,
since
our
delightful
security
,
I
have
repeat
it
to
him
more
fully
,
have
give
him
every
encouragement
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
Time
,
a
very
little
time
,
I
tell
him
,
will
do
everything
;
Marianne
's
heart
be
not
to
be
waste
for
ever
on
such
a
man
as
Willoughby
.
<EOS>
His
own
merit
must
soon
secure
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
judge
from
the
Colonel
's
spirit
,
however
,
you
have
not
yet
make
him
equally
sanguine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
He
think
Marianne
's
affection
too
deeply
rooted
for
any
change
in
it
under
a
great
length
of
time
,
and
even
suppose
her
heart
again
free
,
be
too
diffident
of
himself
to
believe
,
that
with
such
a
difference
of
age
and
disposition
he
could
ever
attach
her
.
<EOS>
there
,
however
,
he
be
quite
mistaken
.
<EOS>
His
age
be
only
so
much
beyond
hers
as
to
be
an
advantage
,
as
to
make
his
character
and
principle
fix
;
 
and
his
disposition
,
I
be
well
convinced
,
be
exactly
the
very
one
to
make
your
sister
happy
.
<EOS>
and
his
person
,
his
manner
too
,
be
all
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
My
partiality
do
not
blind
me
;
he
certainly
be
not
so
handsome
as
Willoughby
 
<EOS>
but
at
the
same
time
,
there
be
something
much
more
pleasing
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
there
be
always
a
something
,
 
if
you
remember
,
 
in
Willoughby
's
eye
at
time
,
which
I
do
not
like

"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
could

remember
it

her
mother
,
without

for
her
assent
,
<EOS>
continue
    
"
and
his
manner
,
the
Colonel
's
manner
be
not
only
more
pleasing
to
me
than
Willoughby
's
ever
be
,
but
they
be
of
a
kind
I
well
know
to
be
more
solidly
attach
to
Marianne
.
<EOS>
Their
gentleness
,
their
genuine
attention
to
other
people
,
and
their
manly
unstudied
simplicity
be
much
more
accordant
with
her
real
disposition
,
than
the
liveliness
 
often
artificial
,
and
often
ill
-
time
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
sure
myself
,
that
have
Willoughby
turn
out
as
really
amiable
,
as
he
have
prove
himself
the
contrary

Marianne
would
yet
never
have
be
so
happy

him

she
will
be
with
Colonel
Brandon

Her
daughter
could
not
quite
agree
with
her
,

her
dissent
be
not
hear

and
therefore
give
no
offence

Delaford

distance

add
Mrs.
Dashwood

even

in

must
arise
from
something
more
than
his
affection
for
Marianne

the
consciousness
of

<EOS>
to

<EOS>
She

anguish

heart

which

an
apparent
composure

which

the
result

must
eventually
lead

contentment

<EOS>
as
they
approach
Barton

indeed
,
and
enter
on
scene
of
which
every
field
and
every
tree
bring
some
peculiar
,
some
painful
recollection

she

silent

turn
away
her
face
from

here

Elinor

when

as

assist
Marianne
from

that

cry
,
she
see
only
an
emotion
too
natural
in
itself
to
raise
any
thing
less
tender
than
pity
,
and
in
its
unobtrusiveness
entitle
to
praise
.
<EOS>
in
the
whole
of
her
subsequent
manner
,
she
trace
the
direction
of
a
mind
awaken
to
reasonable
exertion
;
for
no
sooner
have
they
enter
their
common
sitting

room
,
than
Marianne
turn
her
eye
around
it
with
a
look
of
resolute
firmness
,
as
if
determine
at

to
accustom
herself
to
the
sight

every
object
with
which
the
remembrance
of
Willoughby
could
be
connect

<EOS>
She
say
little
,

<EOS>
every
sentence
aim
at
cheerfulness

though
a
sigh
sometimes
escape
her
,
it
never
pass
away
without
the
atonement
of
a
smile

<EOS>
after
dinner
she
would
try
her
piano

forte

<EOS>
She
go
to
it
;
but
the
music

procure
for
her
by
Willoughby

contain
some

their
favourite
duet

and
bear
on
its
outward
leaf
her
own
name
in
his
hand

writing

<EOS>
that

not
do

<EOS>
She
shake
her

put
the

aside

and
after
run
over
the
key
for
a
minute
,
complain
of
feebleness
in
her
finger
,
and
close
the
instrument
again
;
declare
however
with
firmness
as
she
do
so

practice
much

body
alike
strengthen
by
rest
,
she
look
and
speak
with
more
genuine
spirit
,
anticipate
the
pleasure
of
Margaret

return
,
and
talk
of
the
dear
family
party
which
would
then
be
restore
,
of
their
mutual
pursuit
and
cheerful
society
,
as
the

happiness

to
Sir

plantation
at
Barton
Cross

I

<EOS>
I

never

later
in
rise

six

and
from
that
time

dinner
I
shall
divide
every
moment
between
music

reading

<EOS>
I
have
form
my
plan

course

serious

Our
own
library
be
too
well
known

me

to
be
resort
to
for
any
thing
beyond
mere
amusement

<EOS>
but
there
be
many
work
well
worth
read
at
the
Park

and
there
be
other
of
more
modern
production

which
I
know
I
can
borrow
of
Colonel
Brandon
.
<EOS>
by
read
only
six
hour
a

day
,
I
shall
gain
in
the
course
of
a
twelvemonth
a
great
deal
of
instruction
which
I

feel
myself
to
want

<EOS>
Elinor
honour
her
for
a
plan
which
originate
so
nobly

this

though
smile
to

eager
fancy
which
have
be

to
the
extreme
of
languid
indolence

selfish
repining

at
work

introduce
excess
into
a
scheme
of
such
rational
employment
and
virtuous
self

<EOS>
Her
smile
however
change
to
a
sigh
when
she
remember
that
promise
to
Willoughby
be
yet
unfulfille
,
and
fear
she
have
that
to
communicate
which
may
again
unsettle
the
mind
of
Marianne
,
and
ruin
at
least
for
a
time
this
fair
prospect

busy
tranquillity

<EOS>
willing
therefore
to
delay
the
evil
hour

at

a
soft

genial
morning

tempt

as
long

the

out

directly

or
postpone
it
till
Marianne
be
in
strong
health

and
they
creep
on
for
a

minute
in
silence

<EOS>
"
I
be
not

too
much
good

Marianne
at

with
a

no

Our

They

bear
more

<EOS>
do
not
,
my
dear
Elinor
,
let
your
kindness
defend
what
I

your

<EOS>
My
illness
have
make
me
think
.
<EOS>
It
have
give
me
leisure
and
calmness
for
serious
recollection

<EOS>
long
before
I
be
enough
recover
to
talk
,
I
be
perfectly
able
to
reflect
.
<EOS>
I
consider
the
past
:
I
see
in
my
own
behaviour
,
since
the
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
with
him
last
autumn
,
nothing
but
a
series
of
imprudence
towards
myself
,
and
want
of
kindness
to
other
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
my
own
feeling
have
prepare
my
suffering
,
and
that
my
want
of
fortitude
under
them
have
almost
lead
me
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
My
illness
,
I
well
know
,
have
be
entirely
bring
on
by
myself
by
such
negligence
of
my
own
health
,
as
I
have
feel
even
at
the
time
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
have
I
die
,
it
would
have
be
self
-
destruction
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
my
danger
till
the
danger
be
remove
;
but
with
such
feeling
as
these
reflection
give
me
,
I
wonder
at
my
recovery
,

no

hazard
her

resolution

soon
find
herself

<EOS>
She
manage
the
recital

as
she
hope

with
address
;
prepare
her
anxious
listener
with
caution
;
relate
simply
and
honestly
the
chief
point
on
which
Willoughby
ground
his
apology
;
do
justice
to
his
repentance

and
soften
only
his
protestation

She
tremble
,
her
eye
be
fix

her

become

She
catch

dread

lead
her
towards
home

till
they
reach
the
door

easily
conjecture
what
her
curiosity
must
be
though
no
question
be
suffer
to
speak
it

talk

nothing

Willoughby

with

anxiously
pre

arrange

should
Marianne
fail

<EOS>
Mrs.

do
not

unmoved

vindication

former
favourite

She
rejoice
in
his
being
clear
from
some
part
of
his
imputed
guilt
;
 
she
be
sorry
for
him
;
 
she
wish
him
happy

<EOS>
but
the
feeling
of
the
past
could
not
be
recall

<EOS>
nothing
could
restore
him
with
a
faith
unbroken
 
a
character
unblemishe
,
to
Marianne
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
do
away
the
knowledge
of
what
the
latter
have
suffer
through
his
mean
,
nor
remove
the
guilt
of
his
conduct
towards
Eliza
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
replace
him
,
therefore
,
in
her
former
esteem

nor
injure
the
interest
of
Colonel
Brandon
.
  
<EOS>
have
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
like
her
daughter
,
hear
Willoughby
's
story
from
himself
,
 
have
she
witness
his
distress
,
and
be
under
the
influence
of
his
countenance
and
his
manner
,
it
be
probable
that
her
compassion
would
have
be
great
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
neither
in
Elinor
's
power
,
nor
in
her
wish

to
rouse
such
feeling
in
another
,
by
her
retail
explanation
,
as
have
at
first
be
call
forth
in
herself

<EOS>
reflection
have
give
calmness
to
her
judgment
,
and
sober
her
own
opinion
of
Willoughby
's
desert
;
she
wish
,
therefore
,
to
declare
only
the
simple
truth

and
lie
open
such
fact
as
be
really
due

his
character

without
any
embellishment
of
tenderness
to
lead
the
fancy
astray

<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
when
they
be
all
three
together

Marianne
begin
voluntarily
to
speak
of
him
again

that
it
be
not
without
an
effort

the
restless
,
unquiet
thoughtfulness
in
which
she
have
be
for
some
time
previously
sit

her
rise
colour

plainly

that

<EOS>
Mrs.

would
have
interrupt
her
instantly
with
soothe
tenderness

have
not
Elinor

who
really
wish
to
hear
her
sister

unbiased
opinion

by
an
eager
sign
,
engage
her
silence

Marianne
slowly
continue
    
<EOS>
"
It

recover

she
add

with
great
calmness

<EOS>
"
You
consider
the
matter
,
"
say
Elinor
,
"
exactly
as
a
good
mind

a
sound
understanding
must
consider
it
;
and
I
dare
say
you
perceive
,
as
well
as
myself
,
not
only
in
this
,
but
in
many
other
circumstance
,
reason
enough
to
be
convince
that
your
marriage

have
involve
you
in
many
certain
trouble
and
disappointment

in
which
you
would
have
be
poorly
support

you

whole
conduct
declare
that
self

denial

a
word
hardly
understand

him

<EOS>
His
demand
and
your
inexperience
together
,
on
a
small

very
small

must
have
bring
on
distress

would

to
attempt
all
the

perhaps

as
long
as
your
frugality

only
on

do
it

reckon

He
would

a

temper

could
make
no
complaint

he
would

be
always
necessitous
 
always
poor

probably
would
soon
have
learn
to
rank
the
innumerable
comfort
of
a
clear
estate
and
good
income
as
of
far
more
importance
,
even
to
domestic
happiness

the
mere
temper
of
a

I

proceed

satisfy

feel

avoid
any
survey

may
weaken
her

pursue

immediately
continue
    
<EOS>

one
observation
may

I

be
fairly
draw
from

difficulty
have
arise
from
the

offence

in

behaviour

Eliza
Williams

that
crime

be
the
origin

one

of

his

discontent

<EOS>
Marianne
assent
most
feelingly
to
the
remark

her
mother
be
lead
by
it
to
an
enumeration
of
Colonel
Brandon

injury
and
merit

warm
as
friendship

design
could

dictate
.

of
it

Elinor

accord
to
her
expectation

see
on
the
two
or
three
follow
day
,
that
Marianne
do
not
continue
to
gain
strength

she
have
do
;

while
her
resolution
be
unsubdue

she
still

her

safely
trust

She

nothing

nothing
new

nothing
certain

of
his

some
letter

of
Marianne

illness

in
the

"
We

him

;
which

afford
her
by
the
correspondence

for
his
name
be
not
even
mention
in
any

the

letter

She
be
not

Their

<EOS>
Marianne
give
a
violent
start
,
fix
her
eye
upon
Elinor
,
see
her
turn
pale
,
and
fall
back
in
her
chair
in
hysteric
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood

whose
eye
,
as
she
answer
the
servant
's
inquiry

have
intuitively
take
the

direction

be
shock
to
perceive
by
Elinor
's
countenance
<EOS>
how
much
she
really
suffer
,
and
a
moment
afterwards
,
alike
distress
by
Marianne
's
situation
,
know
not
on
which
child
to
bestow
her
principal
attention

<EOS>
the

who
see
only
that
Miss
Marianne
be
take
ill

have
sense
enough
to
call
one
of
the
maid

who
,
with
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
assistance
,
support
her
into
the
other
room

<EOS>
by
that
time

Marianne

rather
well

leave
her
to
the
care
of
Margaret

the
maid

return
to
Elinor

who

though
still
much
disorder

have
so
far
recover
the
use
of
her
reason
and
voice
as
to
be
just
begin
an
inquiry
of
Thomas

as
to
the
source
of
his

<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
immediately
take
all
that
trouble

Elinor
have
the
benefit
of
the
information
without

seek
it

<EOS>
"
who
tell
you
that
Mr.
Ferrars
be
marry
,
Thomas
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
Mr.
Ferrars
myself
,
madam
,
this
morning
in
Exeter
,
and
his
lady
too
,
Miss
Steele
as
be
.
<EOS>
They
be
stop
in
a
chaise
at
the
door
of
the
New
London
Inn
,
as
I
go
there
with
a
message
from
Sally
at
the
Park
to
her
brother
,
who
be
one
of
the
post
-
boy
.
<EOS>
I
happen
to
look
up
as
I
go
by
the
chaise
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
see
directly
it
be
the
young
Miss
Steele
;
so
I
take
off
my
hat
,
and
she
know
me
and
call
to
me
,
and
inquire
after
you
,
madam
,
and
the
young
lady
,
especially
Miss
Marianne
,
and
bid
me
I
should
give
her
compliment
and
Mr.
Ferrars
's
,
their
good
compliment
and
service
,
and
how
sorry
they
be
they
have
not
time
to
come
on
and
see
you
,
but
they
be
in
a
great
hurry
to
go
forwards
,
for
they
be
go
further
down
for
a
little
while
,
but
however
,
when
they
come
back
,
they
would
make
sure
to
come
and
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
do
she
tell
you
she
be
married
,
Thomas
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
.
<EOS>
She
smile
,
and
say
how
she
have
change
her
name
since
she
be
in
these
part
.
<EOS>
She
be
always
a
very
affable
and
free
-
spoken
young
lady
,
and
very
civil
behave
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
make
free
to
wish
her
joy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
Mr.
Ferrars
in
the
carriage
with
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
,
I
just
see
him
lean
back
in
it
,
but
he
do
not
look
up
;
 
he
never
be
a
gentleman
much
for
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
's
heart
could
easily
account
for
his
not
put
himself
forward
;
and
Mrs.
Dashwood
probably
find
the
same
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
no
one
else
in
the
carriage
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
madam
,
only
they
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
where
they
come
from
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
come
straight
from
town
,
as
Miss
Lucy
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ferrars
tell
me
.
"
  
"
and
be
they
go
farther
westward
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
 
but
not
to
bide
long
.
<EOS>
They
will
soon
be
back
again
,
and
then
they
would
be
sure
and
call
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
now
look
at
her
daughter
;
but
Elinor
know
better
than
to
expect
them
.
<EOS>
She
recognise
the
whole
of
Lucy
in
the
message
,
and
be
very
confident
that
Edward
would
never
come
near
them
.
<EOS>
She
observe
in
a
low
voice
,
to
her
mother
,
that
they
be
probably
go
down
to
Mr.
Pratt
's
,
near
Plymouth
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
's
intelligence
seem
over
.
<EOS>
Elinor
look
as
if
she
wish
to
hear
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
them
off
,
before
you
come
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
madam
 
<EOS>
the
horse
be
just
come
out
,
but
I
could
not
bide
any
longer
;
I
be
afraid
of
be
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Mrs.
Ferrars
look
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
,
she
say
how
she
be
very
well
;
and
to
my
mind
she
be
always
a
very
handsome
young
lady
 
<EOS>
and
she
seem
vastly
contented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
could
think
of
no
other
question
,
and
Thomas
and
the
tablecloth
,
now
alike
needless
,
be
soon
afterwards
dismiss
.
<EOS>
Marianne
have
already
send
to
say
,
that
she
should
eat
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
and
Elinor
's
appetite
be
equally
lose
,
and
Margaret
may
think
herself
very
well
off
,
that
with
so
much
uneasiness
as
both
her
sister
have
lately
experience
,
so
much
reason
as
they
have
often
have
to
be
careless
of
their
meal
,
she
have
never
be
oblige
to
go
without
her
dinner
before
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
dessert
and
the
wine
be
arrange
,
and
Mrs.
Dashwood
and
Elinor
be
leave
by
themselves
,
they
remain
long
together
in
a
similarity
of
thoughtfulness
and
silence
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
fear
to
hazard
any
remark
,
and
venture
not
to
offer
consolation
.
<EOS>
She
now
find
that
she
have
err
in
rely
on
Elinor
's
representation
of
herself
;
and
justly
conclude
that
every
thing
have
be
expressly
soften
at
the
time
,
to
spare
her
from
an
increase
of
unhappiness
,
suffer
as
she
then
have
suffer
for
Marianne
.
<EOS>
She
find
that
she
have
be
mislead
by
the
careful
,
the
considerate
attention
of
her
daughter
,
to
think
the
attachment
,
which
once
she
have
so
well
understand
,
much
slighter
in
reality
,
than
she
have
be
will
not
to
believe
,
or
than
it
be
now
prove
to
be
.
<EOS>
She
fear
that
under
this
persuasion
she
have
be
unjust
,
inattentive
,
nay
,
almost
unkind
,
to
her
Elinor
;
that
Marianne
's
affliction
,
because
more
acknowledged
,
more
immediately
before
her
,
have
too
much
engross
her
tenderness
,
and
lead
her
away
to
forget
that
in
Elinor
she
may
have
a
daughter
suffer
almost
as
much
,
certainly
with
less
self
-
provocation
,
and
great
fortitude
.
    
<EOS>
Elinor
now
find
the
difference
between
the
expectation
of
an
unpleasant
event
,
however
certain
the
mind
may
be
tell
to
consider
it
,
and
certainty
itself
.
<EOS>
She
now
find
,
that
in
spite
of
herself
,
she
have
always
admit
a
hope
,
while
Edward
remain
single
,
that
something
would
occur
to
prevent
his
marry
Lucy
;
that
some
resolution
of
his
own
,
some
mediation
of
friend
,
or
some
more
eligible
opportunity
of
establishment
for
the
lady
,
would
arise
to
assist
the
happiness
of
all
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
now
married
;
and
she
condemn
her
heart
for
the
lurking
flattery
,
which
so
much
heighten
the
pain
of
the
intelligence
.
  
<EOS>
that
he
should
be
marry
soon
,
before
(
as
she
imagine
)
<EOS>
he
could
be
in
order
,
and
consequently
before
he
could
be
in
possession
of
the
living
,
surprise
her
a
little
at
first
.
<EOS>
but
she
soon
see
how
likely
it
be
that
Lucy
,
in
her
self
-
provident
care
,
in
her
haste
to
secure
him
,
should
overlook
every
thing
but
the
risk
of
delay
.
<EOS>
They
be
married
,
married
in
town
,
and
now
hasten
down
to
her
uncle
's
.
<EOS>
what
have
Edward
feel
on
be
within
four
mile
from
Barton
,
on
see
her
mother
's
servant
,
on
hear
Lucy
's
message
!
  
<EOS>
They
would
soon
,
she
suppose
,
be
settle
at
Delaford
;
 
Delaford
,
 
that
place
in
which
so
much
conspire
to
give
her
an
interest
;
which
she
wish
to
be
acquaint
with
,
and
yet
desire
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
She
see
them
in
an
instant
in
their
parsonage
-
house
;
see
in
Lucy
,
the
active
,
contrive
manager
,
unite
at
once
a
desire
of
smart
appearance
with
the
utmost
frugality
,
and
ashamed
to
be
suspect
of
half
her
economical
practice
;
pursue
her
own
interest
in
every
thought
,
court
the
favour
of
Colonel
Brandon
,
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
and
of
every
wealthy
friend
.
<EOS>
in
Edward
,
she
know
not
what
she
see
,
nor
what
she
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
happy
or
unhappy
,
nothing
please
her
;
she
turn
away
her
head
from
every
sketch
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
flatter
herself
that
some
one
of
their
connection
in
London
would
write
to
them
to
announce
the
event
,
and
give
farther
particular
,
 
but
day
after
day
pass
off
,
and
bring
no
letter
,
no
tiding
.
<EOS>
though
uncertain
that
any
one
be
to
blame
,
she
find
fault
with
every
absent
friend
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
thoughtless
or
indolent
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
do
you
write
to
Colonel
Brandon
,
madam
?
"
be
an
inquiry
which
spring
from
the
impatience
of
her
mind
to
have
something
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
write
to
him
,
my
love
,
last
week
,
and
rather
expect
to
see
,
than
to
hear
from
him
again
.
<EOS>
I
earnestly
press
his
come
to
us
,
and
should
not
be
surprised
to
see
him
walk
in
today
or
tomorrow
,
or
any
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
gain
something
,
something
to
look
forward
to
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Brandon
must
have
some
information
to
give
.
  
<EOS>
scarcely
have
she
so
determined
it
,
when
the
figure
of
a
man
on
horseback
draw
her
eye
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
He
stop
at
their
gate
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
gentleman
,
it
be
Colonel
Brandon
himself
.
<EOS>
now
she
could
hear
more
;
and
she
tremble
in
expectation
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
 
it
be
_
not
_
Colonel
Brandon
 
<EOS>
neither
his
air
 
nor
his
height

<EOS>
be
it
possible
,
she
must
say
it
must
be
Edward

<EOS>
She
look
again
.
<EOS>
He
have
just
dismount
;
 
she
could
not
be
mistake
,
 
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
_
be
_
Edward

<EOS>
She
move
away
and
sit
down
.

<EOS>
He
come
from
Mr.
Pratt
's
purposely
to
see
us
.
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
will
_
be
calm
,
I
_
will
_
be
mistress
of
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
moment
she
perceive
that
the
other
be
likewise
aware
of
the
mistake
.
<EOS>
She
see
her
mother
and
Marianne
change
colour
;
see
them
look
at
herself
,
and
whisper
a
few
sentence
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
give
the
world
to
be
able
to
speak
 
and
to
make
them
understand
that
she
hope
no
coolness
,
no
slight
,
would
appear
in
their
behaviour
to
him
;
 
but
she
have
no
utterance
,
and
be
oblige
to
leave
all
to
their
own
discretion
.
  
<EOS>
not
a
syllable
pass
aloud
.
<EOS>
They
all
wait
in
silence
for
the
appearance
of
their
visitor
.
<EOS>
His
footstep
be
hear
along
the
gravel
path
;
in
a
moment
he
be
in
the
passage
,
and
in
another
he
be
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
His
countenance
,
as
he
enter
the
room
,
be
not
too
happy
,
even
for
Elinor
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
be
white
with
agitation
,
and
he
look
as
if
fearful
of
his
reception
,
and
conscious
that
he
merit
no
kind
one
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
however
,
conform
,
as
she
trust
,
to
the
wish
of
that
daughter
,
by
whom
she
then
mean
in
the
warmth
of
her
heart
to
be
guide
in
every
thing

meet
with
a
look
of
force
complacency
,
give
him
her
hand
,
and
wish
him
joy
.
  
<EOS>
He
colour
,
and
stammer
out
an
unintelligible
reply
.
<EOS>
Elinor
's
lip
have
move
with
her
mother
's
,
and
,
when
the
moment
of
action
be
over
,
she
wish
that
she
have
shake
hand
with
him
too
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
then
too
late
,
and
with
a
countenance
meaning
to
be
open
,
she
sit
down
again
and
talk
of
the
weather
.
  
<EOS>
Marianne
have
retreat
as
much
as
possible
out
of
sight
,
to
conceal
her
distress
;
and
Margaret
,
understand
some
part
,
but
not
the
whole
of
the
case
,
think
it
incumbent
on
her
to
be
dignified
,
and
therefore
take
a
seat
as
far
from
him
as
she
could
,
and
maintain
a
strict
silence
.
  
<EOS>
when
Elinor
have
cease
to
rejoice
in
the
dryness
of
the
season
,
a
very
awful
pause
take
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
put
an
end
to
by
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
who
feel
oblige
to
hope
that
he
have
leave
Mrs.
Ferrars
very
well

in

He

be
repeat
by
Marianne
and
her
mother
in
an
accent
of
the
utmost
amazement
;
 
and
though
Elinor
could
not
speak
,
even
_
<EOS>
her
_
eye
be
fix
on
him
with
the
same
impatient
wonder
.
<EOS>
He
rise
from
his
seat
,
and
walk
to
the
window
,
apparently
from
not
know
what
to
do
;
take
up
a
pair
of
scissor
that
lie
there
,
and
while
spoil
both
them
and
their
sheath
by
cut
the
latter
to
piece
as
he
speak
,
say
,
in
a
hurried
voice
    
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
you
may
not
have
hear
that
my
brother
be
lately
married
to
 
to
the
young
 
to
Miss
Lucy
Steele
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
word
be
echo
with
unspeakable
astonishment
by
all
but
Elinor
,
who
sit
with
her
head
lean
over
her
work
,
in
a
state
of
such
agitation
as
make
her
hardly
know
where
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
,
"
they
be
marry
last
week
,
and
be
now
at
Dawlish

"
  
<EOS>
Elinor
could
sit
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
She
almost
run
out
of
the
room
,
and
as
soon
as
the
door
be
close
,
burst
into
tear
of
joy
,
which
at
first
she
think
would
never
cease
.
<EOS>
Edward
,
who
have
till
then
look
any
where
,
rather
than
at
her
,
see
her
hurry
away
,
and
perhaps
see
,
or
even
hear
,
her
emotion
;
for
immediately
afterwards
he
fall
into
a
reverie
,
which
no
remark
,
no
inquiry
,
no
affectionate
address
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
could
penetrate
,
and
at
last
,
without
say
a
word
,
quit
the
room
,
and
walk
out
towards
the
village
,
leave
the
other
in
the
great
astonishment
and
perplexity
on
a
change
in
his
situation
,
so
wonderful
and
so
sudden
,
 
a
perplexity
which
they
have
no
means
of
lessening
but
by
their
own
conjecture
.
    
<EOS>
Unaccountable
,
however
,
as
the
circumstance
of
his
release
may
appear
to
the
whole
family
,
it
be
certain
that
Edward
be
free
;
and
to
what
purpose
that
freedom
would
be
employ
be
easily
pre
-
determined
by
all
;
 
for
after
experience
the
blessing
of
_
one
_
imprudent
engagement
,
contract
without
his
mother
's
consent
,
as
he
have
already
do
for
more
than
four
year
,
nothing
less
could
be
expect
of
him
in
the
failure
of
_
that
_
,
than
the
immediate
contraction
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
His
errand
at
Barton
,
in
fact
,
be
a
simple
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
to
ask
Elinor
to
marry
him
;
 
and
consider
that
he
be
not
altogether
inexperienced
in
such
a
question
,
it
may
be
strange
that
he
should
feel
so
uncomfortable
in
the
present
case
as
he
really
do
,
so
much
in
need
of
encouragement
and
fresh
air
.
  
<EOS>
how
soon
he
have
walk
himself
into
the
proper
resolution
,
however
,
how
soon
an
opportunity
of
exercise
<EOS>
it
occur
,
in
what
manner
he
express
himself
,
and
how
he
be
receive
,
need
not
be
particularly
tell
.
<EOS>
this
only
nee
be
say
;
 
that
when
they
all
sit
down
to
table
at
four
o'clock
,
about
three
hour
after
his
arrival
,
he
have
secure
his
lady
,
engage
her
mother
's
consent
,
and
be
not
only
in
the
rapturous
profession
of
the
lover
,
but
,
in
the
reality
of
reason
and
truth
,
one
of
the
happy
of
man
.
<EOS>
His
situation
indeed
be
more
than
commonly
joyful
.
<EOS>
He
have
more
than
the
ordinary
triumph
of
accepted
love
to
swell
his
heart
,
and
raise
his
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
be
release
without
any
reproach
to
himself
,
from
an
entanglement
which
have
long
form
his
misery
,
from
a
woman
whom
he
have
long
cease
to
love
;
and
elevate
at
once
to
that
security
with
another
,
which
he
must
have
think
of
almost
with
despair
,
as
soon
as
he
have
learn
to
consider
it
with
desire
.
<EOS>
He
be
bring
,
not
from
doubt
or
suspense
,
but
from
misery
to
happiness
;
and
the
change
be
openly
speak
in
such
a
genuine
,
flowing
,
grateful
cheerfulness
,
as
his
friend
have
never
witness
in
him
before
.
  
<EOS>
His
heart
be
now
open
to
Elinor
,
all
its
weakness
,
all
its
error
confess
,
and
his
first
boyish
attachment
to
Lucy
treat
with
all
the
philosophic
dignity
of
twenty
-
four
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
foolish
,
idle
inclination
on
my
side
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
consequence
of
ignorance
of
the
world
and
want
of
employment
.
<EOS>
have
my
mother
give
me
some
active
profession
when
I
be
remove
at
eighteen
from
the
care
of
Mr.
Pratt
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
nay
,
I
be
sure
,
it
would
never
have
happen
;
for
though
I
leave
Longstaple
with
what
I
think
,
at
the
time
,
a
most
unconquerable
preference
for
his
niece
,
yet
have
I
then
have
any
pursuit
,
any
object
to
engage
my
time
and
keep
me
at
a
distance
from
her
for
a
few
month
,
I
should
very
soon
have
outgrow
the
fancy
attachment
,
especially
by
mix
more
with
the
world
,
as
in
such
case
I
must
have
do
.
<EOS>
but
instead
of
have
any
thing
to
do
,
instead
of
have
any
profession
choose
for
me
,
or
be
allow
to
choose
any
myself
,
I
return
home
to
be
completely
idle
;
and
for
the
first
twelvemonth
afterwards
I
have
not
even
the
nominal
employment
,
which
belong
to
the
university
would
have
give
me
;
for
I
be
not
enter
at
Oxford
till
I
be
nineteen
.
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
,
but
to
fancy
myself
in
love
;
and
as
my
mother
do
not
make
my
home
in
every
respect
comfortable
,
as
I
have
no
friend
,
no
companion
in
my
brother
,
and
dislike
new
acquaintance
,
it
be
not
unnatural
for
me
to
be
very
often
at
Longstaple
,
where
I
always
feel
myself
at
home
,
and
be
always
sure
of
a
welcome
;
and
accordingly
I
spend
the
great
part
of
my
time
there
from
eighteen
to
nineteen
:
<EOS>
Lucy
appear
everything
that
be
amiable
and
obliging
.
<EOS>
She
be
<EOS>
pretty
too
 
at
least
I
think
<EOS>
so
_
then
_
;
and
I
have
see
so
little
of
other
woman
,
that
I
could
make
no
comparison
,
and
see
no
defect
.
<EOS>
consider
everything
,
therefore
,
I
hope
,
foolish
as
our
engagement
be
,
foolish
as
it
have
since
in
every
way
be
prove
,
it
be
not
at
the
time
an
unnatural
or
an
inexcusable
piece
of
folly

<EOS>
the
change
which
a
few
hour
have
work
in
the
mind

the
happiness
of
the
Dashwoods

be
such
 
so
great

be

neither

Elinor
 
<EOS>
how
be
_

her
_
feeling
to

describe

from
the
moment
of
learn
that
Lucy
be

that
Edward

compare
her

so
lately
it

see
him
honourably
release

instantly
profit
by
the

to
address
herself

declare
an
affection
as
tender

as
constant
as
she
have
ever
suppose
it
to

she
be
oppress
,
she
be
overcome
by
her
own
felicity
;
and
happily
dispose
as
be
the
human
mind
to
be
easily
familiarize
with
any

Edward
be
now
fix
at
the
cottage
at

for
a
week

for
whatever
other
claim
may

make
on

it
be
impossible
that
less
than
a
week
should
be
give
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
Elinor

suffice
to

half
that

a

Lucy

marriage
,
the
unceasing
and
reasonable
wonder
among
them
all
,
form
of
course
one
of
the
early
discussion
of
the
lover
;
 
and
Elinor
's
particular
knowledge
of
each
party
make
it
appear
to
her
in
every
view
,
as
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
and
unaccountable
circumstance
she
have
ever
hear
.
<EOS>
how
they
could
be
throw
together
,
and
by
what
attraction
Robert
could
be
draw
on
to
marry
a
girl
,
of
whose
beauty
she
have
herself
hear
him
speak
without
any
admiration

a
girl
too
already
engage
to
his
brother

on
whose
account
that
brother
have
be
throw
off

it
be
beyond
her
comprehension
to
make
out

<EOS>
to
her
own
heart
it
be
a
delightful
affair
,
to
her
imagination
it
be
even
a
ridiculous
one
,
but
to
her
reason
,
her
judgment
,
it
be
completely
a
puzzle
.
  
<EOS>
Edward
could
only
attempt
an
explanation
by
supposing
,
that
,
perhaps
,
at
first
accidentally
meeting
,
the
vanity
of
the
one
have
be
so
work
on
by
the
flattery
of
the
other

as
to
lead
by
degree
to
all
the
rest

<EOS>
Elinor
remember
what
Robert
have
tell
her
in
Harley
Street
,
of
his
opinion
of
what
his
own
mediation
in
his
brother
's
affair
may
have
do

"

that

that

he
presently
add

may
perhaps
be
in

his

head
when
the
acquaintance

first
begin

and
Lucy
perhaps
at
first
may
think
only
of
procure
his
good
office
in
my
favour

other

may
afterward
arise

<EOS>
how
long
it
have
be
carry
on
between
them
,
however
,
he
be
equally
at
a
loss
with
herself
to
make
out
;
for
at
Oxford
,
where
he
have
remain
for
choice
ever
since
his
quit
London
,
he
have
have
no
means
of
hearing
of
her
but
from
herself
,
and
her
letter
to
the
very
last
be
neither
less
frequent
,
nor
less
affectionate
than
usual
.
<EOS>
not
the
small
suspicion
,
therefore
,
have
ever
occur
to
prepare
him
for
what
follow
;
 
and
when
at
last
it
burst
on
him
in
a
letter
from
Lucy
herself

,
he
have
be
for
some
time
,
he
believe
,
half
stupifie
between
the
wonder
,
the
horror
,
and
the
joy
of
such
a
deliverance

<EOS>
He
put
the
letter
into
Elinor

<EOS>
"

I
believe
I
may
say
that
since
the
first
half
year
of
our
foolish
business
this
be
the
only
letter
I
ever
receive
from

come
about

married

your

have
bring
on
herself
a
most
appropriate
punishment

<EOS>
the
independence
she
settle
on
Robert
,
through
resentment
against
you
,
have
put
it
in
his
power
to
make
his

choice

she
have
actually
be
bribe
one
son
with
a
thousand
a

year
,
to
do
the
very
deed
which
she
disinherit
the
other
for
intend
to

She
will
hardly
be
less
hurt

by

<EOS>
in
what
state
the
affair
stand
at
present
between
them
,
Edward
know
not
,
for
no
communication
with
any
of
his
family
have
yet
be
attempt
by
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
quit
Oxford
within
four
and
twenty
hour
after
Lucy
's
letter
arrive
,
and
with
only
one
object
before
him
,
the
near
road
to
Barton
,
have
have
no
leisure
to
form
any
scheme
of
conduct
,
with
which
that
road
do
not
hold
the
most
intimate
connection
.
<EOS>
He
could
do
nothing
till
he
be
assure
of
his
fate
with
Miss
Dashwood
;
and
by
his
rapidity
in
seek
_
that
_
fate
,
it
be
to
be
suppose
,
in
spite
of
the
jealousy
with
which
he
have
once
think
of
Colonel
Brandon
,
in
spite
of
the
modesty
with
which
he
rate
his
own
desert
,
and
the
politeness
with
which
he
talk
of
his
doubt
,
he
do
not
,
upon
the
whole
,
expect
a
very
cruel
reception
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
business
,
however
,
to
say
that
he
_
do
_
,
and
he
say
it
very
prettily
.
<EOS>
what
he
may
say
on
the
subject
a
twelvemonth
after
,
must
be
refer
to
the
imagination
of
husband
and
wife
.
  
<EOS>
that
Lucy
have
certainly
mean
to
deceive
,
to
go
off
with
a
flourish
of
malice
against
him
in
her
message
by
Thomas
,
be
perfectly
clear
to
Elinor
;
and
Edward
himself
,
now
thoroughly
enlighten
on
her
character
,
have
no
scruple
in
believe
her
capable
of
the
utmost
meanness
of
wanton
ill
-
nature
.
<EOS>
though
his
eye
have
be
long
open
,
even
before
his
acquaintance
with
Elinor
begin
,
to
her
ignorance
and
a
want
of
liberality
in
some
of
her
opinion
,
they
have
be
equally
impute
,
by
him
,
to
her
want
of
education
;
and
till
her
last
letter
reach
him
,
he
have
always
believe
her
to
be
a
well
-
dispose
,
good
-
hearted
girl
,
and
thoroughly
attach
to
himself
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
such
a
persuasion
could
have
prevent
his
put
an
end
to
an
engagement
,
which
,
long
before
the
discovery
of
it
lay
him
open
to
his
mother
's
anger
,
have
be
a
continual
source
of
disquiet
and
regret
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
my
duty
,
"
say
he
,
"
independent
of
my
feeling
,
to
give
her
the
option
of
continue
the
engagement
or
not
,
when
I
be
renounce
by
my
mother
,
and
stand
to
all
appearance
without
a
friend
in
the
world
to
assist
me
.
<EOS>
in
such
a
situation
as
that
,
where
there
seem
nothing
to
tempt
the
avarice
or
the
vanity
of
any
live
creature
,
how
could
I
suppose
,
when
she
so
earnestly
,
so
warmly
insist
on
share
my
fate
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
that
any
thing
but
the
most
disinterested
affection
be
her
inducement
?
<EOS>
and
even
now
,
I
can
not
comprehend
on
what
motive
she
act
,
or
what
fancy
advantage
it
could
be
to
her
,
to
be
fetter
to
a
man
for
whom
she
have
not
the
small
regard
,
and
who
have
only
two
thousand
pound
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
foresee
that
Colonel
Brandon
would
give
me
a
living
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
but
she
may
suppose
that
something
would
occur
in
your
favour
;
that
your
own
family
may
in
time
relent
.
<EOS>
and
at
any
rate
,
she
lose
nothing
by
continue
the
engagement
,
for
she
have
prove
that
it
fetter
neither
her
inclination
nor
her
action
.
<EOS>
the
connection
be
certainly
a
respectable
one
,
and
probably
gain
her
consideration
among
her
friend
;
and
,
if
nothing
more
advantageous
occur
,
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
marry
_
<EOS>
you
_
<EOS>
than
be
single
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Edward
be
,
of
course
,
immediately
convince
that
nothing
could
have
be
more
natural
than
Lucy
's
conduct
,
nor
more
self
-
evident
than
the
motive
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Elinor
scold
him
,
harshly
as
lady
always
scold
the
imprudence
which
compliment
themselves
,
for
have
spend
so
much
time
with
them
at
Norland
,
when
he
must
have
feel
his
own
inconstancy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
behaviour
be
certainly
very
wrong
,
"
say
she
;
"
because
 
to
say
nothing
of
my
own
conviction
,
our
relation
be
all
lead
away
by
it
to
fancy
and
expect
_
<EOS>
what
_
,
as
you
be
_
<EOS>
then
_
situate
,
could
never
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
could
only
plead
an
ignorance
of
his
own
heart
,
and
a
mistaken
confidence
in
the
force
of
his
engagement
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
simple
enough
to
think
,
that
because
my
_
faith
_
be
plight
to
another
,
there
could
be
no
danger
in
my
being
with
you
;
and
that
the
consciousness
of
my
engagement
be
to
keep
my
heart
as
safe
and
sacred
as
my
honour
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
admire
you
,
but
I
tell
myself
it
be
only
friendship
;
and
till
I
begin
to
make
comparison
between
yourself
and
Lucy
,
I
do
not
know
how
far
I
be
get
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
I
suppose
,
I
_
be
_
wrong
in
remain
so
much
in
Sussex
,
and
the
argument
with
which
I
reconcile
myself
to
the
expediency
of
it
,
be
no
well
than
these
:
 
<EOS>
the
danger
be
my
own
;
I
be
do
no
injury
to
anybody
but
myself

<EOS>
Elinor
smile
,
and
shake
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
Edward
hear
with
pleasure
of
Colonel
Brandon
's

Cottage

he
really

not

to

to

an
opportunity

convince
him
that

so
ungraciously

as
mine

occasion

he

I

never

him
for
offer

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
now
_
<EOS>
he
feel
astonish
himself
that
he
have
never
yet
be
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
but
so
little
interest
have
he
take
in
the
matter
,
that
he
owe
all
his
knowledge
of
the
house

garden
,
and

extent
of
the
parish
,
condition
of
the
land

and
rate
of
the
tithe

to
Elinor
herself
,
who
have
hear
so
much
of
it
from
Colonel
Brandon
,
and
hear
it
with
so
much
attention
,
as
to
be
entirely
mistress
of
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
one
question
after
this
only
remain
undecided
,
between
them
,
one
difficulty
only
be
to
be
overcome
.
<EOS>
They
be
bring
together
by
mutual
affection
,
with
the
warm
approbation
of
their
real
friend
;
their
intimate
knowledge
of
each
other
seem
to
make
their
happiness
certain
 
<EOS>
and
they
only
want
something
to
live
upon
.
<EOS>
Edward
have
two
thousand
pound
,
and
Elinor
one
,
which
,
with
Delaford
living
,
be
all
that
they
could
call
their
own
;
for
it
be
impossible
that
Mrs.
Dashwood
should
advance
anything
;
and
they
be
neither
of
them
quite
enough
in
love
to
think
that
three
hundred
and
fifty
pound
a
-
year
would
supply
them
with
the
comfort
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
Edward
be
not
entirely
without
hope
of
some
favourable
change
in
his
mother
towards
him
;
and
on
_
that
_
he
rest
for
the
residue
of
their
income
.
<EOS>
but
Elinor
have
no
such
dependence
;
for
since
Edward
would
still
be
unable
to
marry
Miss
Morton
,
and
his
choose
herself
have
be
speak
of
in
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
flattering
language
as
only
a
less
evil
than
his
choose
Lucy
Steele
<EOS>
,
she
fear
that
Robert
's
offence
would
serve
no
other
purpose
than
to
enrich
Fanny
.
  
<EOS>
about
four
day
after
Edward
's
arrival
Colonel
Brandon
appear
,
to
complete
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
satisfaction
,
and
to
give
her
the
dignity
of
have
,
for
the
first
time
since
her
living
at
Barton
,
more
company
with
her
than
her
house
would
hold
.
<EOS>
Edward
be
allow
to
retain
the
privilege
of
first
comer
,
and
Colonel
Brandon
therefore
walk
every
night
to
his
old
quarter
at
the
Park
;
from
whence
he
usually
return
in
the
morning
,
early
enough
to
interrupt
the
lover
'
first
tête
-
à
-
tête
before
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
a
three
week
'
residence
at
Delaford
,
where
,
in
his
evening
hour
at
least
,
he
have
little
to
do
but
to
calculate
the
disproportion
between
thirty
-
six
and
seventeen
,
bring
him
to
Barton
in
a
temper
of
mind
which
need
all
the
improvement
in
Marianne
's
look
,
all
the
kindness
of
her
welcome
,
and
all
the
encouragement
of
her
mother
's
language
,
to
make
it
cheerful
.
<EOS>
among
such
friend
,
however
,
and
such
flattery
,
he
do
revive
.
<EOS>
no
rumour
of
Lucy
's
marriage
have
yet
reach
him
:
 
<EOS>
he
know
nothing
of
what
have
pass
;
and
the
first
hour
of
his
visit
be
consequently
spend
in
hearing
and
in
wonder
.
<EOS>
every
thing
be
explain
to
him
by
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
and
he
find
fresh
reason
to
rejoice
in
what
he
have
do
for
Mr.
Ferrars
,
since
eventually
it
promote
the
interest
of
Elinor
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
needless
to
say
,
that
the
gentleman
advance
in
the
good
opinion
of
each
other
,
as
they
advance
in
each
other
's
acquaintance
,
for
it
could
not
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Their
resemblance
in
good
principle
and
good
sense
,
in
disposition
and
manner
of
thinking
,
would
probably
have
be
sufficient
to
unite
them
in
friendship
,
without
any
other
attraction
;
but
their
being
in
love
with
two
sister
,
and
two
sister
fond
of
each
other
,
make
that
mutual
regard
inevitable
and
immediate
,
which
may
otherwise
have
wait
the
effect
of
time
and
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
the
letter
from
town
,
which
a
few
day
before
would
have
make
every
nerve
in
Elinor
's
body
thrill
with
transport
,
now
arrive
to
be
read
with
less
emotion
that
mirth
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
write
to
tell
the
wonderful
tale
,
to
vent
her
honest
indignation
against
the
jilting
girl
,
and
pour
forth
her
compassion
towards
poor
Mr.
Edward
,
who
,
she
be
sure
,
have
quite
dote
upon
the
worthless
hussy
,
and
be
now
,
by
all
account
,
almost
broken

hearted
,
at
Oxford
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
think

she

nothing
be
ever

on
so
sly
;
for
it
be
but
two
day
before
Lucy
call
and
sit
a
couple
of
hour
with
me
.
<EOS>
not
a
soul
suspect
anything
of
the
matter

not
even
Nancy
,
who
,
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
come
cry
to
me
the
day
after
,
in
a
great
fright
for
fear
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
as
well
as
not
know
how
to
get
to
Plymouth

Lucy
it
seem
borrow
all
her
money
before
she
go
off
to
be
marry
,
on
purpose
we
suppose
to
make
a
show
with
,
and
poor
Nancy
have
not
seven
shilling
in
the
world

so
I
be
very
glad
to
give
her
five
guinea
to
take
her
down
to
Exeter
,
where
she
think
of
stay
three
or
four
week
with
Mrs.
Burgess
,
in
hope
,
as
I
tell
her
,
to
fall
in
with
the
Doctor
again
.
<EOS>
and
I
must
say
that
Lucy
's
crossness
not
to
take
them
along
with
them
in
the
chaise
be
bad
than
all
.
<EOS>
poor
Mr.
Edward
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
get
him
out
of
my
head
,
but
you
must
send
for
him
to
Barton
,
and
Miss
Marianne
must
try
to
comfort
him
.

Mr.
Dashwood

strain
be
more
solemn

the
most
unfortunate

agony

the

such
a
blow

grateful
wonder

's
offence

unpardonable

Lucy

be
infinitely
bad

neither
of
them
be
ever
again
to
be
mention
to
Mrs.
Ferrars
;
and
even
,
if
she
may
hereafter
be
induce
to
forgive
her
son
,
his
wife
should
never
be
acknowledge
as
her
daughter

the
secrecy
with
which
everything
have

on
between

as
enormously
heighten
the
crime

because
,
have
any
suspicion
of
it
occur
to
the
other

proper
measure
would
have
be
take
to
prevent
the
marriage

and
he
call
on
Elinor
to
join
with
him
in
regret
that
Lucy

engagement
with
Edward

not
rather
be

misery
farther

by

perhaps
a

He
have
nothing

him

as
he
declare
a

great
willingness

mean
concession
by

the

quit
Barton
together
.
<EOS>
They
be
to
go

that
Edward

have
some
personal
knowledge
of
his

a
proper
resistance
on
the
part
of
Mrs.

just
so
violent

so
steady

for

she

have
two
son

the
crime
and
annihilation
of
Edward
a
few
week
ago

have
rob
her
of
one

the
similar
annihilation
of

have
leave
her

by
the
resuscitation

he
do
not
feel
the
continuance

secure

till
he
have
reveal
his

engagement

for
the
publication
of
that
circumstance

he
fear
,
may
give
a
sudden
turn
to
his
constitution

carry
him
off
as
rapidly

<EOS>
with
apprehensive
caution
therefore
it
be
reveal

he
be
listen
to
with
unexpected
calmness

<EOS>
Mrs.
Ferrars
at
first
reasonably
endeavour
to
dissuade
him
from
marry
Miss
Dashwood
,
by
every
argument
in
her
power
;
tell
him
,
that
in
Miss
Morton
he
would
have
a
woman
of
high
rank
and
large
fortune
;
and
enforce
the
assertion
,
by
observe
that
Miss
Morton
be
the
daughter
of
a
nobleman
with
thirty
thousand
pound
,
while
Miss
Dashwood
be
only
the
daughter
of
a
private
gentleman
with
no
more
than
_
three
_
;
but
when
she
find
that
,
though
perfectly
admit
the
truth
of
her
representation
,
he
be
by
no
mean
inclined
to
be
guide
by
it
,
she
judge
it
wisest
,
from
the
experience
of
the
past
,
to
submit
;
and
therefore
,
after
such
an
ungracious
delay
as
she
owe
to
her
own
dignity
,
and
as
serve
to
prevent
every
suspicion
of
good
-
will
,
she
issue
her
decree
of
consent
to
the
marriage
of
Edward
and
Elinor
.
  
<EOS>
what
she
would
engage
to
do
towards
augment
their
income
be
next
to
be
consider
;
and
here
it
plainly
appear
,
that
though
Edward
be
now
her
only
son
,
he
be
by
no
means
her
eld
;
for
while
Robert
be
inevitably
endow
with
a
thousand
pound
a
-
year
,
not
the
small
objection
be
make
against
Edward
's
take
order
for
the
sake
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
at
the
utmost
;
nor
be
anything
promise
either
for
the
present
or
in
future
,
beyond
the
ten
thousand
pound
,
which
have
be
give
with
Fanny
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
as
much
,
however
,
as
be
desire
,
and
more
than
be
expect
,
by
Edward
and
Elinor
;
and
Mrs.
ferrar
herself
,
by
her
shuffling
excuse
,
seem
the
only
person
surprised
at
her
not
give
more
.
  
<EOS>
with
an
income
quite
sufficient
to
their
want
thus
secure
to
them
,
they
have
nothing
to
wait
for
after
Edward
be
in
possession
of
the
living
,
but
the
readiness
of
the
house
,
to
which
Colonel
Brandon
,
with
an
eager
desire
for
the
accommodation
of
Elinor
,
be
make
considerable
improvement
;
and
after
wait
some
time
for
their
completion
,
after
experience
,
as
usual
,
a
thousand
disappointment
and
delay
from
the
unaccountable
dilatoriness
of
the
workman
,
Elinor
,
as
usual
,
break
through
the
first
positive
resolution
of
not
marry
till
every
thing
be
ready
,
and
the
ceremony
take
place
in
Barton
church
early
in
the
autumn
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
month
after
their
marriage
be
spend
with
their
friend
at
the
Mansion
-
house
;
from
whence
they
could
superintend
the
progress
of
the
Parsonage
,
and
direct
every
thing
as
they
like
on
the
spot
;
 
could
choose
paper
,
project
shrubbery
,
and
invent
a
sweep
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jennings
's
prophecy
,
though
rather
jumble
together
,
be
chiefly
fulfil
;
for
she
be
able
to
visit
Edward
and
his
wife
in
their
parsonage
by
Michaelmas
,
and
she
find
in
Elinor
and
her
husband
,
as
she
really
believe
,
one
of
the
happy
couple
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
They
have
in
fact
nothing
to
wish
for
,
but
the
marriage
of
Colonel
Brandon
and
Marianne
,
and
rather
well
pasturage
for
their
cow
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
visit
on
their
first
settling
by
almost
all
their
relation
and
friend
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ferrars
come
to
inspect
the
happiness
which
she
be
almost
ashamed
of
have
authorise
;
and
even
the
Dashwoods
be
at
the
expense
of
a
journey
from
Sussex
to
do
them
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
that
I
be
disappointed
,
my
dear
sister
,
"
say
John
,
as
they
be
walk
together
one
morning
before
the
gate
of
Delaford
House
,
"
_
that
_
would
be
say
too
much
,
<EOS>
for
certainly
you
have
be
one
of
the
most
fortunate
young
woman
in
the
world
,
as
it
be
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
confess
,
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
to
call
Colonel
Brandon
brother
.
<EOS>
His
property
here
,
his
place
,
his
house
,
 
every
thing
be
in
such
respectable
and
excellent
condition
!
<EOS>
and
his
wood
,
 
I
have
not
see
such
timber
any
where
in
Dorsetshire
,
as
there
be
now
stand
in
Delaford
Hanger
!
<EOS>
and
though
,
perhaps
,
Marianne
may
not
seem
exactly
the
person
to
attract
him
,
yet
I
think
it
would
altogether
be
advisable
for
you
to
have
them
now
frequently
stay
with
you
,
for
as
Colonel
Brandon
seem
a
great
deal
at
home
,
nobody
can
tell
what
may
happen
;
for
,
when
people
be
much
throw
together
,
and
see
little
of
anybody
else
,
 
and
it
will
always
be
in
your
power
to
set
her
off
to
advantage
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
you
may
as
well
give
her
a
chance
;
You
understand
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
though
Mrs.
Ferrars
_
do
_
come
to
see
them
,
and
always
treat
them
with
the
make
-
believe
of
decent
affection
,
they
be
never
insult
by
her
real
favour
and
preference
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
be
due
to
the
folly
of
Robert
,
and
the
cunning
of
his
wife
;
and
it
be
earn
by
them
before
many
month
have
pass
away
.
<EOS>
the
selfish
sagacity
of
the
latter
,
which
have
at
first
draw
Robert
into
the
scrape
,
be
the
principal
instrument
of
his
deliverance
from
it
;
for
her
respectful
humility
,
assiduous
attention
,
and
endless
flattery
,
as
soon
as
the
small
opening
be
give
for
their
exercise
,
reconcile
Mrs.
Ferrars
to
his
choice
,
and
re
-
establish
him
completely
in
her
favour
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
of
Lucy
's
behaviour
in
the
affair
,
and
the
prosperity
which
crown
it
,
therefore
,
may
be
hold
forth
as
a
most
encouraging
instance
of
what
an
earnest
,
an
unceasing
attention
to
self
-
interest
,
however
its
progress
may
be
apparently
obstruct
,
will
do
in
secure
every
advantage
of
fortune
,
with
no
other
sacrifice
than
that
of
time
and
conscience
.
<EOS>
when
Robert
first
seek
her
acquaintance
,
and
privately
visit
her
in
Bartlett
's
Buildings
,
it
be
only
with
the
view
impute
to
him
by
his
brother
.
<EOS>
He
merely
mean
to
persuade
her
to
give
up
the
engagement
;
and
as
there
could
be
nothing
to
overcome
but
the
affection
of
both
,
he
naturally
expect
that
one
or
two
interview
would
settle
the
matter
.
<EOS>
in
that
point
,
however
,
and
that
only
,
he
err
;
for
though
Lucy
soon
give
him
hope
that
his
eloquence
would
convince
her
in
_
time
_
,
another
visit
,
another
conversation
,
<EOS>
be
always
want
to
produce
this
conviction
.
<EOS>
some
doubt
always
linger
in
her
mind
when
they
part
,
which
could
only
be
remove
by
another
half
hour
's
discourse
with
himself
.
<EOS>
His
attendance
be
by
this
mean
secure
,
and
the
rest
follow
in
course
.
<EOS>
instead
of
talk
of
Edward
,
they
come
gradually
to
talk
only
of
Robert
,
 
a
subject
on
which
he
have
always
more
to
say
than
on
any
other
,
and
in
which
she
soon
betray
an
interest
even
equal
to
his
own
;
and
in
short
,
it
become
speedily
evident
to
both
,
that
he
have
entirely
supplant
his
brother
.
<EOS>
He
be
proud
of
his
conquest
,
proud
of
trick
Edward
,
and
very
proud
of
marry
privately
without
his
mother
's
consent
.
<EOS>
what
immediately
follow
be
know
.
<EOS>
They
pass
some
month
in
great
happiness
at
Dawlish
;
for
she
have
many
relation
and
old
acquaintance
to
cut
 
and
he
draw
several
plan
for
magnificent
cottage
;
and
from
thence
return
to
town
,
procure
the
forgiveness
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
by
the
simple
expedient
of
ask
it
,
which
,
at
Lucy
's
instigation
,
be
adopt
.
<EOS>
the
forgiveness
,
at
first
,
indeed
,
as
be
reasonable
,
comprehend
only
Robert
;
and
Lucy
,
who
have
owe
his
mother
no
duty
and
therefore
could
have
transgress
none
,
still
remain
some
week
longer
unpardoned
.
<EOS>
but
perseverance
in
humility
of
conduct
and
message
,
in
self
-
condemnation
for
Robert
's
offence
,
and
gratitude
for
the
unkindness
she
be
treat
with
,
procure
her
in
time
the
haughty
notice
which
overcome
her
by
its
graciousness
,
and
lead
soon
afterwards
,
by
rapid
degree
,
to
the
high
state
of
affection
and
influence
.
<EOS>
Lucy
become
as
necessary
to
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
as
either
Robert
or
Fanny
;
and
while
Edward
be
never
cordially
forgive
for
have
once
intend
to
marry
her
,
and
Elinor
,
though
superior
to
her
in
fortune
and
birth

of
as
an
intruder
,
_
she
_
be
in
every
thing
consider
,
and
always
openly
acknowledge
,
to
be
a
favourite
child
.
<EOS>
They
settle
in
town
,
receive
very
liberal
assistance
from
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
be
on
the
good
term
imaginable
with
the
dashwood
;
and
set
aside
the
jealousy
and
ill
-
will
continually
subsist
between
Fanny
and
Lucy
,
in
which
their
husband
of
course
take
a
part
,
as
well
as
the
frequent
domestic
disagreement
between
Robert
and
Lucy
themselves
,
nothing
could
exceed
the
harmony
in
which
they
all
live
together

<EOS>
what
Edward
have
do
to
forfeit
the
right
of
eld
son

may
have
puzzle
many
people
to
find
out
;
and
what
Robert
have
do
to
succeed
to
it
,
may
have
puzzle
them
still
more
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
arrangement
,
however
,
justify
in
its
effect
,
if
not
in
its
cause
;
for
nothing
ever
appear
in
Robert
's
style
of
living
or
of
talk
to
give
a
suspicion
of
his
regretting
the
extent
of
his
income
,
as
either
leave
his
brother
too
little
,
or
bring
himself
too
much
;
 
and
if
Edward
may
be
judge
from
the
ready
discharge
of
his
duty
in
every
particular
,
from
an
increase
attachment
to
his
wife
and
his
home
,
and
from
the
regular
cheerfulness
of
his
spirit
,
he
may
be
suppose
no

contented
with
his
lot

no

free
from
every

an
exchange

family
as
could

Marianne
Dashwood
be
bear
to
an
extraordinary
fate
.
<EOS>
She
be
bear
to
discover
the
falsehood
of
her
own
opinion
,
and
to
counteract
,
by
her
conduct
,
her
most
favourite
maxim
.
<EOS>
She
be
bear
to
overcome
an
affection
form
so
late
in
life
as
at
seventeen
,
and
with
no
sentiment
superior
to
strong
esteem
and
lively
friendship
,
voluntarily
to
give
her
hand
to
another
!
 
<EOS>
and
_
<EOS>
that
_
other
,
a
man
who
have
suffer
no
less
than
herself
under
the
event
of
a
former
attachment
,
whom
,
two
year
before
,
she
have
consider
too
old
to
be
marry
,
 
and
who
still
seek
the
constitutional
safeguard
of
a
flannel
waistcoat
!
  
<EOS>
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
instead
of
fall
a
sacrifice
to
an
irresistible
passion
,
as
once
she
have
fondly
flatter
herself
with
expecting
,
instead
of
remain
even
for
ever
with
her
mother
,
and
find
her
only
pleasure
in
retirement
and
study
,
as
afterwards
in
her
more
calm
and
sober
judgment
she
have
determine
on
,
 
she
find
herself
at
nineteen
,
submit
to
new
attachment
,
enter
on
new
duty
,
place
in
a
new
home
,
a
wife
,
the
mistress
of
a
family
,
and
the
patroness
of
a
village
.
  
<EOS>
Colonel
Brandon
be
now
as
happy
,
as
all
those
who
best
love
him
,
believe
he
deserve
to
be
;
 
in
Marianne
he
be
console
for
every
past
affliction
;
 
her
regard
and
her
society
restore
his
mind
to
animation
,
and
his
spirit
to
cheerfulness
;
and
that
Marianne
find
her
own
happiness
in
form
his
,
be
equally
the
persuasion
and
delight
of
each
observe
friend
.
<EOS>
Marianne
could
never
love
by
half
;
and
her
whole
heart
become
,
in
time
,
as
much
devoted
to
her
husband
,
as
it
have
once
be
to
Willoughby
.
  
<EOS>
Willoughby
could
not
hear
of
her
marriage
without
a
pang
;
and
his
punishment
be
soon
afterwards
complete
in
the
voluntary
forgiveness
of
Mrs.
Smith
,
who
,
by
state
his
marriage
with
a
woman
of
character
,
as
the
source
of
her
clemency
,
give
him
reason
for
believe
that
have
he
behave
with
honour
towards
Marianne
,
he
may
at
once
have
be
happy
and
rich
.
<EOS>
that
his
repentance
of
misconduct
,
which
thus
bring
its
own
punishment
,
be
sincere
,
need
not
be
doubt
;
 
nor
that
he
long
thought
of
Colonel
Brandon
with
envy
,
and
of
Marianne
with
regret
.
<EOS>
but
that
he
be
for
ever
inconsolable
,
that
he
flee
from
society
,
or
contract
an
habitual
gloom
of
temper
,
or
die
of
a
broken
heart
,
must
not
be
depend
on
 
for
he
do
neither
.
<EOS>
He
live
to
exert
,
and
frequently
to
enjoy
himself
.
<EOS>
His
wife
be
not
always
out
of
humour
,
nor
his
home
always
uncomfortable
;
and
in
his
breed
of
horse
and
dog
,
and
in
sporting
of
every
kind
,
he
find
no
inconsiderable
degree
of
domestic
felicity
.
  
<EOS>
for
Marianne
,
however
,
in
spite
of
his
incivility
in
survive
her
loss
,
he
always
retain
that
decide
regard
which
interest
him
in
every
thing
that
befall
her
,
and
make
her
his
secret
standard
of
perfection
in
woman
;
and
many
a
rise
beauty
would
be
slight
by
him
in
after
-
day
as
bear
no
comparison
with
Mrs.
Brandon
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dashwood
be
prudent
enough
to
remain
at
the
cottage
,
without
attempt
a
removal
to
Delaford
;
and
fortunately
for
Sir
John
and
Mrs.
Jennings
,
when
Marianne
be
take
from
them
,
Margaret
have
reach
an
age
highly
suitable
for
dancing
,
and
not
very
ineligible
for
be
suppose
to
have
a
lover
.
  
<EOS>
between
Barton
and
Delaford
,
there
be
that
constant
communication
which
strong
family
affection
would
naturally
dictate
;
 
and
among
the
merit
and
the
happiness
of
Elinor
and
Marianne
,
let
it
not
be
rank
as
the
least
considerable
,
that
though
sister
,
and
live
almost
within
sight
of
each
other
,
they
could
live
without
disagreement
between
themselves
,
or
produce
coolness
between
their
husband
.
