My
father
's
family
name
be
Pirrip
,
and
my
christian
name
Philip
,
my
infant
tongue
could
make
of
both
name
nothing
longer
or
more
explicit
than
Pip
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
call
myself
Pip
,
and
come
to
be
call
Pip
.
  
<EOS>
I
give
Pirrip
as
my
father
's
family
name
,
on
the
authority
of
his
tombstone
and
my
sister
---
Mrs
Joe
Gargery
,
who
marry
the
blacksmith
.
<EOS>
as
I
never
see
my
father
or
my
mother
,
and
never
see
any
likeness
of
either
of
them
(
for
their
day
be
long
before
the
day
of
photograph
)
,
my
first
fancy
regard
what
they
be
like
,
be
unreasonably
derive
from
their
tombstone
.
<EOS>
the
shape
of
the
letter
on
my
father
's
,
give
me
an
odd
idea
that
he
be
a
square
,
stout
,
dark
man
,
with
curly
black
hair
.
<EOS>
from
the
character
and
turn
of
the
inscription
,

"
also
Georgiana
Wife
of
the
Above
,

<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
I
draw
a
childish
conclusion
that
my
mother
be
freckle
and
sickly
.
<EOS>
to
five
little
stone
lozenge
,
each
about
a
foot
and
a
half
long
which
be
arrange
in
a
neat
row
beside
their
grave
,
and
be
sacred
to
the
memory
of
five
little
brother
of
mine
---
who
give
up
try
to
get
a
living
,
exceedingly
early
in
that
universal
struggle
---
I
be
indebte
for
a
belief
I
religiously
entertain
that
they
have
all
be
bear
on
their
back
with
their
hand
in
their
trouser
-
pocket
,
and
have
never
take
them
out
in
this
state
of
existence
.
  
<EOS>
Ours
be
the
marsh
country
,
down
by
the
river
,
within
,
as
the
river
wound
,
twenty
mile
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
My
first
most
vivid
and
broad
impression
of
the
identity
of
thing
,
seem
to
me
to
have
be
gain
on
a
memorable
raw
afternoon
towards
evening
.
<EOS>
at
such
a
time
I
find
out
for
certain
,
that
this
bleak
place
overgrow
with
nettle
be
the
churchyard
;
and
that
Philip
Pirrip
,
late
of
this
parish
,
and
also
Georgiana
wife
of
the
above
,
be
dead
and
bury
;
and
that
Alexander
,
Bartholomew
,
Abraham
,
Tobias
,
and
Roger
,
infant
child
of
the
aforesaid
,
be
also
dead
and
bury
;
and
that
the
dark
flat
wilderness
beyond
the
churchyard
,
intersect
with
dyke
and
mound
and
gate
,
with
scatter
cattle
feed
on
it
,
be
the
marsh
;
and
that
the
low
leaden
line
beyond
,
be
the
river
;
and
that
the
distant
savage
lair
from
which
the
wind
be
rush
be
the
sea
;
and
that
the
small
bundle
of
shiver
grow
afraid
of
it
all
and
begin
to
cry
,
be
Pip
.
  
<EOS>
"

a
terrible
voice

as
a
man

up
from
among

at
the
side
of

porch

<EOS>
"

hold
tight

tombstone
on

to

a

tremendous
dip

so

<EOS>
then
,

arm

in
an
upright
position
on

top
of
the
stone

and
go
on
in
these
fearful
term
:
  
<EOS>
"
You

You

old
Battery
over
yonder

You

<EOS>
now
,
I
be
not
alone
,
as
you
may
think
I
be
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
young
man
hide
with
me
,
in
comparison
with
which
young
man
I
be
a
Angel

<EOS>
that
young
man
hear
the
word
I
speak

<EOS>
that
young
man
have
a
secret
way
pecooliar
to
himself
,
of
get
at
a
boy
,
and
at
his
heart
,
and
at
his
liver
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
wain
for
a
boy
to
attempt
to
hide
himself
from
that
young
man
.
<EOS>
a
boy
may
lock
his
door
,
may
be
warm
in
bed
,
may
tuck
himself
up
,
may
draw
the
clothe
over
his
head
,
may
think
himself
comfortable
and
safe
,
but
that
young
man
will
softly
creep
and
creep
his
way
to
him
and
tear
him
open
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
keeping
that
young
man
from
harm
of
you
at
the
present
moment

with
great
difficulty

<EOS>
I
find
it
wery
hard
to
hold
that
young
man
off
of
your
inside
.
<EOS>
now
,
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
that
I
would
get
him
the
file
,
and
I
would
get
him
what
break
bit
of
food
<EOS>
I
could
,
and
I
would
come
to
him
at
the
Battery
early
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
say
Lord
strike
you
dead
if
you
do
not
!
"
say
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
so
,
and
he
take
me
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
he
pursue
,
"
you
remember
what
you
have
undertake
,
and
you
remember
that
young
man
,
and
you
get
home
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
goo
-
good
night
,
sir
,
"
I
falter
.
  
<EOS>
"
much
of
that
!
"
say
he
,
glance
about
him
over
the
cold
wet
flat
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
be
a
frog
.
<EOS>
or
a
eel
!
"
  
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
he
hug
his
shudder
body
in
both
his
arm
---
clasp
himself
,
as
if
to
hold
himself
together
---
and
limp
towards
the
low
church
wall
.
<EOS>
as
I
see
him
go
,
pick
his
way
among
the
nettle
,
and
among
the
bramble
that
bind
the
green
mound
,
he
look
in
my
young
eye
as
if
he
be
elude
the
hand
of
the
dead
people
,
stretch
up
cautiously
out
of
their
grave
,
to
get
a
twist
upon
his
ankle
and
pull
him
in
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
the
low
church
wall
,
he
get
over
it
,
like
a
man
whose
leg
be
numb
and
stiff
,
and
then
turn
round
to
look
for
me
.
<EOS>
when
I
see
him
turn
,
I
set
my
face
towards
home
,
and
make
the
good
use
of
my
leg
.
<EOS>
but
presently
I
look
over
my
shoulder
,
and
see
him
go
on
again
towards
the
river
,
still
hug
himself
in
both
arm
,
and
pick
his
way
with
his
sore
foot
among
the
great
stone
drop
into
the
marsh
here
and
there
for
step
-
place
when
the
rain
be
heavy
,
or
the
tide
be
in
.
  
<EOS>
the
marsh
be
just
a
long
black
horizontal
line
then
,
as
I
stop
to
look
after
him
;
and
the
river
be
just
another
horizontal
line
,
not
nearly
so
broad
nor
yet
so
black
;
and
the
sky
be
just
a
row
of
long
angry
red
line
and
dense
black
line
intermix
.
<EOS>
on
the
edge
of
the
river
I
could
faintly
make
out
the
only
two
black
thing
in
all
the
prospect
that
seem
to
be
stand
upright
;
one
of
these
be
the
beacon
by
which
the
sailor
steer
---
like
an
unhooped
cask
upon
a
pole
---
an
ugly
thing
when
you
be
near
it
;
the
other
a
gibbet
,
with
some
chain
hang
to
it
which
have
once
hold
a
pirate
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
limp
on
towards
this
latter
,
as
if
he
be
the
pirate
come
to
life
,
and
come
down
,
and
go
back
to
hook
himself
up
again
.
<EOS>
It
give
me
a
terrible
turn
when
I
think
so
;
and
as
I
see
the
cattle
lift
their
head
to
gaze
after
him
,
I
wonder
whether
they
think
so
too
.
<EOS>
I
look
all
round
for
the
horrible
young
man
,
and
could
see
no
sign
of
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
now
I
be
frightened
again
,
and
run
home
without
stop
.

chapter
2
 
<EOS>
My
sister
,
Mrs
Joe
Gargery
,
be
more
than
twenty
year
old
than
I
,
and
have
establish
a
great
reputation
with
herself
and
the
neighbour
because
she
have
bring
me
up
"
by
hand
"
.
<EOS>
have
at
that
time
to
find
out
for
myself
what
the
expression
mean
,
and
know
her
to
have
a
hard
and
heavy
hand
,
and
to
be
much
in
the
habit
of
lay
it
upon
her
husband
as
well
as
upon
me
,
I
suppose
that
Joe
Gargery
and
I
be
both
bring
up
by
hand
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
not
a
good
-
look
woman
,
my
sister
;
and
I
have
a
general
impression
that
she
must
have
make
Joe
Gargery
marry
her
by
hand
.
<EOS>
Joe
be
a
fair
man
,
with
curl
of
flaxen
hair
on
each
side
of
his
smooth
face
,
and

My

Mrs

,
with
black
hair
and
eye
,
have
such
a
prevail
redness
of
skin
that
I
sometimes
use
to
wonder
whether
it
be
possible
she
wash
herself
with
a
nutmeg
-
grater
instead
of
soap
.
<EOS>
She
be
tall
and
bony
,
and
almost
always
wear
a
coarse
apron

fasten
over
her
figure
behind
with
two
loop
,
and
have
a
square
impregnable
bib
in
front
,
that
be
stick
full
of
pin
and
needle

<EOS>
She
make
it
a
powerful
merit
in
herself
,
and
a
strong
reproach
against
Joe
,
that
she
wear
this
apron
so
much
.
<EOS>
though
I
really
see
no
reason
why
she
should
have
wear
it
at
all
:
or
<EOS>
why
,
if
she
do
wear
it
at
all
,
she
should
not
have
take
it
off
,
every
day
of
her

the

I
raise

<EOS>
at

I
twist

<EOS>
I
take
the
advice

<EOS>
My

Mrs

,
throw
the
door
wide
open
,
and
find
an
obstruction
behind
it

immediately
divine
the
cause
,
and
apply
Tickler
to
its
further
investigation
.
<EOS>
She
conclude
by
throw
me

I
often
serve
as

at
Joe

who

glad

pass
me
on

<EOS>
tell

<EOS>

It

<EOS>
My

stray
from

I
look
disconsolately
at
the
fire

<EOS>
for
,
the
fugitive
out
on
the
marsh
with
the
iron
leg
<EOS>
the
mysterious
young

the

the

and
the

"

Mrs

restore

<EOS>
one
of

,
by

the

have
not

it
at
all

<EOS>
"
You
will
drive
 
\
me
<EOS>
\
 
to
the
churchyard
betwixt
you

one
of
these
day

<EOS>
and
oh

a
pr

r

recious
pair
<EOS>
you
would
be
without

!
"
  
<EOS>
as
she
apply
herself
to
set
the
tea
-
thing
,
Joe
peep
down
at
me
over
his
leg
,
as
if
he
be
mentally
cast
me
and
himself
up
,
and
calculate
what
kind
of
pair
we
practically
should
make
,
under
the
grievous
circumstance
foreshadow
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
he
sit
feel
his
right
-
side
flaxen
curl
and
whisker
,
and
follow
Mrs
Joe
about
with
his
blue
eye
,
as
his
manner
always
be
at
squally
time
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
have
a
trenchant
way
of
cut
our
bread
-
and
-
butter
for
us
that
never
vary
.
<EOS>
first
,
with
her
left
hand
she
jam
the
loaf
hard
and
fast
against
her
bib
---
where
it
sometimes
get
a
pin
into
it
,
and
sometimes
a
needle
,
which
we
afterwards
get
into
our
mouth
.
<EOS>
then
she
take
some
butter
(
not
too
much
)
on
a
knife
and
spread
it
on
the
loaf
,
in
an
apothecary
kind
of
way
,
as
if
she
be
make
a
plaister
---
use
both
side
of
the
knife
with
a
slapping
dexterity
,
and
trim
and
mould
the
butter
off
round
the
crust
.
<EOS>
then
,
she
give
the
knife
a
final
smart
wipe
on
the
edge
of
the
plaister
,
and
then
saw
a
very
thick
round
off
the
loaf
:
which
she
finally
,
before
separate
from
the
loaf
,
hew
into
two
half
,
of
which
Joe
get
one
,
and
I
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
present
occasion
,
though
I
be
hungry
,
I
dare
not
eat
my
slice
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
must
have
something
in
reserve
for
my
dreadful
acquaintance
,
and
his
ally
the
still
more
dreadful
young
man
.
<EOS>
I
know
Mrs
Joe
's
housekeeping
to
be
of
the
strict
kind
,
and
that
my
larcenous
research
may
find
nothing
available
in
the
safe
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
resolve
to
put
my
hunk
of
bread
-
and
-
butter
down
the
leg
of
my
trouser
.
  
<EOS>
the
effort
of
resolution
necessary
to
the
achievement
of
this
purpose
<EOS>
,
I
find
to
be
quite
awful
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
I
have
to
make
up
my
mind
to
leap
from
the
top
of
a
high
house
,
or
plunge
into
a
great
depth
of
water
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
make
the
more
difficult
by
the
unconscious
Joe
.
<EOS>
in
our
already
-
mention
freemasonry
as
fellow
-
sufferer
,
and
in
his
good
-
natured
companionship
with
me
,
it
be
our
evening
habit
to
compare
the
way
we
bite
through
our
slice
,
by
silently
hold
them
up
to
each
other
's
admiration
now
and
then
---
which
stimulate
us
to
new
exertion
.
<EOS>
to
-
night
,
Joe
several
time
invite
me
,
by
the
display
of
his
fast
-
diminish
slice
,
to
enter
upon
our
usual
friendly
competition
;
but
he
find
me
,
each
time
,
with
my
yellow
mug
of
tea
on
one
knee
,
and
my
untouched
bread
-
and
-
butter
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
I
desperately
consider
that
the
thing
I
contemplate
must
be
do
,
and
that
it
have
best
be
do
in
the
least
improbable
manner
consistent
with
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
I
take
advantage
of
a
moment
when
Joe
have
just
look
at
me
,
and
get
my
bread
-
and
-
butter
down
my
leg
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
be
evidently
make
uncomfortable
by
what
he
suppose
to
be
my
loss
of
appetite
,
and
take
a
thoughtful
bite
out
of
his
slice
,
which
he
do
not
seem
to
enjoy
.
<EOS>
He
turn
it
about
in
his
mouth
much
longer
than
usual
,
ponder
over
it
a
good
deal
,
and
after
all
gulp
it
down
like
a
pill
.
<EOS>
He
be
about
to
take
another
bite
,
and
have
just
get
his
head
on
one
side
for
a
good
purchase
on
it
,
when
his
eye
fall
on
me
,
and
he
see
that
my
bread
-
and
-
butter
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
wonder
and
consternation
with
which
Joe
stop
on
the
threshold
of
his
bite
and
stare
at
me
,
be
too
evident
to
escape
my
sister
's
observation
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
now
?
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
smartly
,
as
she
put
down
her
cup
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
you
know
!
"
mutter
Joe
,
shake
his
head
at
me
in
very
serious
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
"
Pip
,
old
chap
!
<EOS>
You
will
do
yourself
a
mischief

It
will
stick
somewhere

<EOS>
"
what
be

now

<EOS>

repeat
my

,
more
sharply
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
can
cough
any
trifle
on
it
up
,
Pip
,
I
would
recommend
you
to
do
it

say
Joe
,
all
aghast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Manners
be

but
still
your
elth

"
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
my
sister
be
quite
desperate
,
so
she
pounce
on
Joe
,
and
,
take
him
by
the
two
whisker
,
knock
his
head
for
a
little
while
against
the
wall
behind
him
:
while
I
sit
in
the
corner
,
look
guiltily
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
perhaps
you
will
mention
what
be
the
matter
,
"
say
my
sister
,
out
of
breath
,
"
you
stare
great
stuck
pig
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Joe
look
at
her
in
a
helpless
way
;
then
take
a
helpless
bite
,
and
look
at
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Pip
,
"
say
Joe
,
solemnly
,
with
his
last
bite
in
his
cheek
,
and
speak
in
a
confidential
voice
,
as
if
we
two
be
quite
alone
,
"
you
and
me
be
always
friend
,
and
I
would
be
the
last
to
tell
upon
you

any
time

<EOS>
but
such
a

"
he
move
his
chair
and
look
about
the
floor
between
us
,
and
then
again
at
me

Bolt

cry
my

<EOS>
"
You
know

old
chap

"
say
Joe
,
look
at
me
,
and
not
at
Mrs
Joe
,
with
his
bite
still
in
his
cheek

<EOS>
"
I
bolt

myself

I

"
  
<EOS>
My
sister
make
a
dive
at
me
,
and
fish
me
up
by
the
hair
:
say
nothing
more
than
the
awful
word
,
"
You
come
along
and
be
dose

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
some
medical
beast
have
revive
Tar
-
water
in
those
day
as
a
fine
medicine
,
and
Mrs
Joe
always
keep
a
supply
of
it
in
the
cupboard
;
have
a
belief
in
its
virtue
correspondent
to
its
nastiness
.
<EOS>
at
the
good
of
time
,
so
much
of
this
elixir
be
administer
to
me
as
a
choice
restorative
,
that
I
be
conscious
of
go
about
,
smell
like
a
new
fence
.
<EOS>
on
this
particular
evening
the
urgency
of
my
case
demand
a
pint
of
this
mixture
,
which
be
pour
down
my
throat
,
for
my
great
comfort
,
while
Mrs

hold
my
head
under
her
arm
,
as
a
boot
would
be
hold
in
a
boot

jack

<EOS>
Joe
get
off
with
half
a
pint
;
but
be
make
to
swallow
that
(
much
to
his
disturbance
,
as
he
sit
slowly
munch
and
meditate
before
the
fire
)
,
"
because
he
have
have
a
turn

"
<EOS>
judge
from
myself
,
I
should
say
he
certainly
have
a
turn
afterwards
,
if
he
have
have
none
before
.
  
<EOS>
Conscience
be
a
dreadful
thing
when
it
accuse
man
or
boy
;
but
when
,
in
the
case
of
a
boy
,
that
secret
burden
co
-
operate
with
another
secret
burden
down
the
leg
of
his
trouser
,
it
be
(
as
I
can
testify
)
a
great
punishment
.
<EOS>
the
guilty
knowledge
that
I
be
go
to
rob
Mrs
Joe
<EOS>
---
I
never
think
I
be
go
to
rob
Joe
,
for
I
never
think
of
any
of
the
housekeeping
property
as
his
---
united
to
the
necessity
of
always
keep
one
hand
on
my
bread
-
and
-
butter
as
I
sit
,
or
when
I
be
order
about
the
kitchen
on
any
small
errand
,
almost
drive
me
out
of
my
mind

<EOS>
then
,
as
the
marsh
wind
make
the
fire
glow
and
flare
,
I
think
I
hear
the
voice
outside
,
of
the
man
with
the
iron
on
his
leg
who
have
swear
me
to
secrecy
,
declare
that
he
could
not
and
would
not
starve
until
to
-
morrow
,
but
must
be
feed
now
.
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
I
think
,
what
if
the
young
man
who
be
with
so
much
difficulty
restrain
from
imbrue
his
hand
in
me
,
should
yield
to
a
constitutional
impatience
,
or
should
mistake
the
time
,
and
should
think
himself
accredit
to
my
heart
and
liver
to
-
night
,
instead
of
to
-
morrow
!
<EOS>
if
ever
anybody
's
hair
stand
on
end
with
terror
,
mine
must
have
do
so
then
.
<EOS>
but
,
perhaps
,
nobody
be
ever
do
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
Christmas
Eve
,
and
I
have
to
stir
the
pudding
for
next
day
,
with
a
copper
-
stick
,
from
seven
to
eight
by
the
dutch
clock
.
<EOS>
I
try
it
with
the
load
upon
my
leg
(
and
that
make
me
think
afresh
of
the
man
with
the
load
on
 
\
his
\
 
leg
)
,
and
find
the
tendency
of
exercise
to
bring
the
bread
-
and
-
butter
out
at
my
ankle
,
quite
unmanageable
.
<EOS>
happily
,
I
slip
away
,
and
deposit
that
part
of
my
conscience
in
my
garret
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
when
I
have
do
my
stirring
,
and
be
take
a
final
warm
in
the
chimney
corner
before
be
send
up
to
bed
;
"
be
that
great
gun

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah

"
say
Joe
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
another

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
that
mean

Joe

say
I.
  
Mrs

who
always

snappishly

<EOS>
while
Mrs

sit
with
her

bend
over
her

,
I
put
my
mouth
into
the
form
of
say
to
Joe
,
"
<EOS>
what
be
a

"
<EOS>
Joe
put
 
\
<EOS>
his
\
 
mouth
into
the
form
of
return
such
a
highly
elaborate
answer
,
that
I
could
make
out
nothing
of
it
but
the
single
word
"
Pip
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be

aloud

after
sunset

and
they
fire

now
,
it

fire
warning

another

<EOS>

Drat
that

interpose
my

frown
at
me
over

what
a

he
be
.
<EOS>
ask
no
question
,
and
you
will
be
tell
no

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
polite
to
herself
,
I
think
,
to
imply
that
I
should
be
tell
lie
by
her
,
even
if
I
do
ask
question
.
<EOS>
but
she
never
be
polite
,
unless
there
be
company
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
point
,
Joe
greatly
augment
my
curiosity
by
take
the
utmost
pain
to
open
his
mouth
very
wide
,
and
to
put
it
into
the
form
of
a
word
that
look
to
me
like
"
sulk
.
"
<EOS>
therefore
,
I
naturally
point
to
Mrs
Joe
,
and
put
my
mouth
into
the
form
of
say
"
her
?
"
<EOS>
but
Joe
would
not
hear
of
that
,
at
all
,
and
again
open
his
mouth
very
wide
,
and
shake
the
form
of
a
most
emphatic
word
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
make
nothing
of
the
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs

,
"
say
I
,
as
a
last
resource
,

I
should
like

"
Lord

exclaim
my

rather
the
contrary

out

at

answer
him
one
question

he
will
ask

a
dozen
directly

I
wonder

say
I
,
in
a
general

,

with
quiet
desperation

<EOS>
It
be
too
much
for

rise

by
ask
question

now

"
  
<EOS>
I
be
never
allow
a
candle
to
light
me
to

,
and
,
as
I
go
upstairs
in
the
dark
,
with
my
head
tingle

from
Mrs

thimble
have
play
the
tambourine
upon

to
accompany
her

I
feel
fearfully
sensible
of
the
great
convenience
that
the
Hulks
be
handy
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
clearly
on
my
way
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
begin
by
ask
question
,
and
I
be
go
to
rob
Mrs
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
since
that
time
,
which
be
fur
enough
away
now
,
I
have
often
think
that
few
people
know
what
secrecy
there
be
in
the
young
,
under
terror
.
<EOS>
no
matter
how
unreasonable
the
terror
,
so
that
it
be
terror
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
mortal
terror
of
the
young
man
who
want
my
heart
and
liver
;
I
be
in
mortal
terror
of
my
interlocutor
with
the
iron
leg
;
I
be
in
mortal
terror
of
myself
,
from
whom
an
awful
promise
have
be
extract
;
I
have
no
hope
of
deliverance
through
my
all
-
powerful
sister
,
who
repulse
me
at
every
turn
;
I
be
afraid
to
think
of
what
I
may
have
do
,
on
requirement
,
in
the
secrecy
of
my
terror
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
sleep
at
all
that
night
,
it
be
only
to
imagine
myself
drift
down
the
river
on
a
strong
spring
-
tide
,
to
the
Hulks
;
a
ghostly
pirate
call
out
to
me
through
a
speaking
-
trumpet
,
as
I
pass
the
gibbet
-
station
,
that
I
have
better
come
ashore
and
be
hang
there
at
once
and
not
put
it
off
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
to
sleep
,
even
if
I
have
be
incline
,
for
I
know
that
at
the
first
faint
dawn
of
morning
I
must
rob
the
pantry
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
do
it
in
the
night
,
for
there
be
no
get
a
light
by
easy
friction
then
;
to
have
get
one
,
I
must
have
strike
it
out
of
flint
and
steel
,
and
have
make
a
noise
like
the
very
pirate
himself
rattle
his
chain
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
great
black
velvet
pall
outside
my
little
window
be
shoot
with
grey
,
I
get
up
and
go
down
stair
;
every
board
upon
the
way
,
and
every
crack
in
every
board
,
call
after
me
,
"
stop
thief

"
<EOS>
and
"
get
up
,
Mrs

"
<EOS>
in
the
pantry
,
which
be
far
more
abundantly
supply
than
usual

owe
to
the

,
I
be
very
much
alarm
,
by
a
hare
hang
up
by
the
heel
,
whom
I
rather
think
I
catch
,
when
my

be
half

wink

<EOS>
I
have
no
time
for
verification
,
no
time
for
selection
,
no
time
for
anything
,
for
I
have
no
time
to
spare
.
<EOS>
I
steal
some
bread
,
some
rind
of
cheese
,
about
half
a
jar
of
mincemeat
(
which
I
tie
up
in
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
with
my
last
night
's
slice
)
,
some
brandy
from
a
stone
bottle
(
which
I
decant
into
a
glass
bottle
I
have
secretly
use
for
make
that
intoxicate
fluid
,
spanish
-
liquorice
-
water
,
up
in
my
room
:
dilute
the
stone
bottle
from
a
jug
in
the
kitchen
cupboard
)
,
a
meat
bone
with
very
little
on
it
,
and
a
beautiful
round
compact
pork
pie
.
<EOS>
I
be
nearly
go
away
without
the
pie
,
but
I
be
tempt
to
mount
upon
a
shelf
,
to
look
what
it
be
that
be
put
away
so
carefully
in
a
covered
earthenware
dish
in
a
corner
,
and
I
find
it
be
the
pie
,
and
I
take
it
,
in
the
hope
that
it
be
not
intend
for
early
use
,
and
would
not
be
miss
for
some
time
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
door
in
the
kitchen
,
communicate
with
the
forge
;
I
unlock
and
unbolt
that
door
,
and
get
a
file
from
among
Joe
's
tool
.
<EOS>
then
,
I
put
the
fastening
as
I
have
find
them
,
open
the
door
at
which
I
have
enter
when
I
run
home
last
night
,
shut
it
,
and
run
for
the
misty
marsh
.
    
<EOS>
chapter
3
 
it
be
a
rimy
morning
,
and
very
damp
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
damp
lie
on
the
outside
of
my
little
window
,
as
if
some
goblin
have
be
cry
there
all
night
,
and
use
the
window
for
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
see
the
damp
lie
on
the
bare
hedge
and
spare
grass
,
like
a
coarser
sort
of
spider
'
webs
;
hang
itself
from
twig
to
twig
and
blade
to
blade
.
<EOS>
on
every
rail
and
gate
,
wet
lay
clammy
;
and
the
marsh
-
mist
be
so
thick
,
that
the
wooden
finger
on
the
post
direct
people
to
our
village
---
a
direction
which
they
never
accept
,
for
they
never
come
there
---
be
invisible
to
me
until
I
be
quite
close
under
it
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
I
look
up
at
it
,
while
it
drip
,
it
seem
to
my
oppress
conscience
like
a
phantom
devote
me
to
the
Hulks
.
  
<EOS>
the
mist
be
heavier
yet
when
I
get
out
upon
the
marsh
,
so
that
instead
of
my
running
at
everything
,
everything
seem
to
run
at
me
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
disagreeable
to
a
guilty
mind
.
<EOS>
the
gate
and
dyke
and
bank
come
burst
at
me
through
the
mist
,
as
if
they
cry
as
plainly
as
could
be
,
"
a
boy
with
somebody
-
else
's
pork
pie
!
<EOS>
stop
him
!
"
<EOS>
the
cattle
come
upon
me
with
like
suddenness
,
stare
out
of
their
eye
,
and
steam
out
of
their
nostril
,
"
Holloa
,
young
thief
!
"
<EOS>
one
black
ox
,
with
a
white
cravat
on
---
who
even
have
to
my
awakened
conscience
something
of
a
clerical
air
---
fix
me
so
obstinately
with
his
eye
,
and
move
his
blunt
head
round
in
such
an
accusatory
manner
as
I
move
round
,
that
I
blubber
out
to
him
,
"
I
could
not
help
it
,
sir
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
myself
I
take
it
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
upon
which
he
put
down
his
head
,
blow
a
cloud
of
smoke
out
of
his
nose
,
and
vanish
with
a
kick
-
up
of
his
hind
-
leg
and
a
flourish
of
his
tail
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
I
be
get
on
towards
the
river
;
but
however
fast
I
go
,
<EOS>
I
could
not
warm
my
foot
,
to
which
the
damp
cold
seem
rivet
,
as
the
iron
be
rivet
to
the
leg
of
the
man
I
be
run
to
meet
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
way
to
the
Battery
,
pretty
straight
,
for
I
have
be
down
there
on
a
Sunday
with
Joe
,
and
Joe
,
sit
on
an
old
gun
,
have
tell
me
that
when
I
be
'
prentice
to
him
regularly
bind
,
we
would
have
such
Larks
there
!
<EOS>
however
,
in
the
confusion
of
the
mist
,
I
find
myself
at
last
too
far
to
the
right
,
and
consequently
have
to
try
back
along
the
river
-
side
,
on
the
bank
of
loose
stone
above
the
mud
and
the
stake
that
stake
the
tide
out
.
<EOS>
make
my
way
along
here
with
all
despatch
,
I
have
just
cross
a
ditch
which
I
know
to
be
very
near
the
Battery
,
and
have
just
scramble
up
the
mound
beyond
the
ditch
,
when
I
see
the
man
sit
before
me
.
<EOS>
His
back
be
towards
me
,
and
he
have
his
arm
fold
,
and
be
nod
forward
,
heavy
with
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
he
would
be
more
glad
if
I
come
upon
him
with
his
breakfast
,
in
that
unexpected
manner
,
so
I
go
forward
softly
and
touch
him
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
jump
up
,
and
it
be
not
the
same
man
,
but
another
man
!
  
<EOS>
and
yet
this
man
be
dress
in
coarse
grey
,
too
,
and
have
a
great
iron
on
his
leg
,
and
be
lame
,
and
hoarse
,
and
cold
,
and
be
everything
that
the
other
man
be
;
except
that
he
have
not
the
same
face
,
and
have
a
flat
broad
-
brim
low
-
crown
feel
hat
on
.
<EOS>
all
this
,
I
see
in
a
moment
,
for
I
have
only
a
moment
to
see
it
in
:
he
swear
an
oath
at
me
,
make
a
hit
at
me
<EOS>
---
it
be
a
round
weak
blow
that
miss
me
and
almost
knock
himself
down
,
for
it
make
him
stumble
---
and
then
he
run
into
the
mist
,
stumble
twice
as
he
go
,
and
I
lose
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
young
man
!
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
feel
my
heart
shoot
as
I
identify
him
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
should
have
feel
a
pain
in
my
liver
,
too
,
if
I
have
know
where
it
be

I
be
soon
at
the
Battery
,
after
that
,
and
there
be
the
right
man
---
hug
himself
and
limp
to
and
fro
,
as
if
he
have
never
all
night
leave
off
hugging
and
limping
---
wait
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
be
awfully
cold
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
I
half
expect
to
see
him
drop
down
before
my
face
and
die
of
deadly
cold
.
<EOS>
His
eye
look
so
awfully
hungry
,
too
,
that
when
I
hand
him
the
file
and
he
lay
it
down
on
the
grass
,
it
occur
to
me
he
would
have
try
to
eat
it
,
if
he
have
not
see
my
bundle
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
turn
me
upside
down
,
this
time
,
to
get
at
what
I
have
,
but
leave
me
right
side
upwards
while
I
open
the
bundle
and
empty
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
in
the
bottle
,
boy
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brandy

say
<EOS>
I.
  
He
be
already
hand
mincemeat
down
his
throat
in
the
most
curious
manner
---
more
like
a
man
who
be
put
it
away
somewhere
in
a
violent
hurry
,
than
a
man
who
be
eat
it
---
but
he
leave
off
to
take
some
of
the
liquor
.
<EOS>
He
shiver
all
the
while
,
so
violently
,
that
it
be
quite
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
keep
the
neck
of
the
bottle
between
his
tooth
,
without
bite
it
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

you
have
get
the
ague

I.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
much
of
your
opinion

It

I

<EOS>
"
I

far

<EOS>
He
be
gobble
mincemeat
,
meat
bone
,
bread
,
cheese
,
and
pork
pie
,
all
at
once
:
stare
distrustfully
while
he
do
so
at
the
mist
<EOS>
all
round
us
,
and
often
stop
---
even
stop
his
jaw
---
to
listen
.
<EOS>
some
real
or
fancied
sound
,
some
clink
upon
the
river
or
breathing
of
beast
upon
the
marsh
,
now
give
him
a
start
,
and
he
say
,
suddenly
:
  
"
You

You

You
would
be

a
fierce

at
your

you
could
help
to

hunt
as
near

dunghill
as

<EOS>
something
click
in
his
throat
,
as
if
he
have
work
in
him
like
a
clock
,

be
go
to
strike

<EOS>
and
he
smear
his
ragged
rough
sleeve
over
his

pity
his
desolation
,

watch
him
as
he
gradually
settle
down
upon
the

I
make
bold
to

,

Thankee

"
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
watch
a
large
dog
of
our
eat
his
food
;
and
I
now
notice
a
decide
similarity
between
the
dog
's
way
of
eating
and
the
man
's
.
<EOS>
the
man
take
strong
sharp
sudden
bite
,
just
like
the
dog
.
<EOS>
He
swallow
,
or
rather
snap
up
,
every
mouthful
,
too
soon
and
too
fast
;
and
he
look
sideways
here
and
there
while
he
eat
,
as
if
he
think
there
be
danger
in
every
direction
,
of
somebody
be
come
to
take
the
pie
away
.
<EOS>
He
be
altogether
too
unsettled
in
his
mind
over
it
,
to
appreciate
it
comfortably
,
I
think
,
or
to
have
anybody
to
dine
with
him
,
without
make
a
chop
with
his
jaw
at
the
visitor
.
<EOS>
in
all
of
which
particular
he
be
very
like
the
dog

<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
you
will
not
leave
any
of
it
for
him

say
I
,
timidly
;
after
a
silence
during
which
I
have
hesitate
as
to
the
politeness
of
make
the
remark
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
more

It
be
the
certainty
of

impel
me
to
offer
the
hint

<EOS>
"
leave
any
for
him

him

my

hold

by

at

look
up

he
be
down

wet

file
at

iron

not

me

mind
his

have
an

off

his

I

say
Mrs

<EOS>
"
I
be
rather
partial

myself

"
  
<EOS>
Joe
,
who
have
venture
into
the
kitchen
after
me
as
the
dust
-
pan
have
retire
before
us
,
draw
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his

with
a
conciliatory
air
when
Mrs

dart
a
look
at
him
,
and
,
when
her
eye
be
withdraw
,
secretly
cross
his
two
forefinger
,
and
exhibit
them
to
me
,
as
our
token
that
Mrs
Joe
be
in
a
cross
temper
.
<EOS>
this
be
so
much
her
normal
state
,
that
Joe
and
I
would
often
,
for
week
together
,
be
,
as
to
our
finger
,
like
monumental
Crusaders
as
to
their
leg
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
to
have
a
superb
dinner
,
consist
of
a
leg
of
pickle
pork
and
green
,
and
a
pair
of
roast
stuff
fowl
.
<EOS>
a
handsome
mince
-
pie
have
be
make
yesterday
morning
(
which
account
for
the
mincemeat
not
be
miss
)
,
and
the
pudding
be
already
on
the
boil
.
<EOS>
these
extensive
arrangement
occasion
us
to
be
cut
off
unceremoniously
in
respect
of
breakfast
;
"
for
I
an't
,
"
say
Mrs

,
"
I
an't
a
go

with
what
I

get
before

,
I
promise
you

<EOS>
so
,
we
have
our
slice
serve
out
,
as
if
we
be
two
thousand
troop
on
a
force
march
instead
of
a
man
and
boy
at
home
;
and
we
take
gulps
of
milk
and
water
,
with
apologetic
countenance
,
from
a
jug
on
the
dresser
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
Mrs
Joe
put
clean
white
curtain
up
,
and
tack
a
new
flower
-
flounce
across
the
wide
chimney
to
replace
the
old
one
,
and
uncover
the
little
state
parlour
across
the
Passage
,
which
be
never
uncover
at
any
other
time
,
but
pass
the
rest
of
the
year
in
a
cool
haze
of
silver
paper
,
which
even
extend
to
the
four
little
white
crockery
poodle
on
the
mantelshelf
,
each
with
a
black
nose
and
a
basket
of
flower
in
his
mouth
,
and
each
the
counterpart
of
the
other

<EOS>
Mrs
Joe
be
a
very
clean
housekeeper
,
but
have
an
exquisite
art
of
make
her
cleanliness
more
uncomfortable
and
unacceptable
than
dirt
itself
.
<EOS>
Cleanliness
be
next
to
Godliness
,
and
some
people
do
the
same
by
their
religion
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
have
so
much
to
do
,
be
go
to
church
vicariously

that
be
to

Joe

I
be
go
.
<EOS>
in
his
work
clothe
,
Joe
be
a
well

knit
characteristic

look
blacksmith

in
his
holiday
clothe
,
he
be
more
like
a
scarecrow
in
good
circumstance
,
than
anything
else
.
<EOS>
nothing
that
he
wear
then
,
fit
him
or
seem
to
belong
to
him
;
and
everything
that
he
wear
then
,
graze
him
.
<EOS>
on
the
present
festive
occasion
he
emerge
from
his

,
when
the
blithe

be
go
,
the
picture
of
misery

in
a
full
suit
of
Sunday
penitential

<EOS>
as
to
me
,
I
think
my
sister
must
have
have
some
general
idea
that
I
be
a
young
offender
whom
an
Accoucheur
Policeman
have
take
up
(
on
my
birthday

and
deliver

be
deal
with
accord
to
the
outraged
majesty
of
the
law

<EOS>
I
be
always
treat
as
if
I
have
insist
on
be
bear
,
in
opposition
to
the
dictate
of
reason
,
religion
,
and
morality
,
and
against
the
dissuade
argument
of
my
good
friend
.
<EOS>
even
when
I
be
take
to
have
a
new
suit
of
clothe
,
the
tailor
have
order
to
make
them
like
a
kind
of
reformatory
,
and
on
no
account
to
let
me
have
the
free
use
of
my
limb
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
and
<EOS>
I
go
to
church
,
therefore
,
must
have
be
a
move
spectacle
for
compassionate
mind
.
<EOS>
yet
,
what
I
suffer
outside
,
be
nothing
to
what
I
undergo
within
.
<EOS>
the
terror
that
have
assail
me
whenever
Mrs
Joe
have
go
near
the
pantry
,
or
out
of
the
room
,
be
only
to
be
equal
by
the
remorse
with
which
my
mind
dwell
on
what
my
hand
have
do
.
<EOS>
under
the
weight
of
my
wicked
secret
,
I
ponder
whether
the
Church
would
be
powerful
enough
to
shield
me
from
the
vengeance
of
the
terrible
young
man
,
if
I
divulge
to
that
establishment
.
<EOS>
I
conceive
the
idea
that
the
time
when
the
bann
be
read
and
when
the
clergyman
say
,
"
Ye
be
now
to
declare
it
!
"
would
be
the
time
for
me
to
rise
and
propose
a
private
conference
in
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
I
be
far
from
be
sure
that
I
may
not
have
astonish
our
small
congregation
by
resort
to
this
extreme
measure
,
but
for
its
be
Christmas
Day
and
no
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
,
the
clerk
at
church
,
be
to
dine
with
us
;
and
Mr
Hubble
the
wheelwright
and
Mrs
Hubble
;
and
Uncle
Pumblechook
(
Joe
's
uncle
,
but
<EOS>
Mrs
Joe
appropriate
him
)
,
who
be
a
well
-
to
-
do
corn
-
chandler
in
the
near
town
,
and
drive
his
own
chaise
-
cart
.
<EOS>
the
dinner
hour
be
half
-
past
one
.
<EOS>
when
Joe
and
I
get
home
,
we
find
the
table
lay
,
and
Mrs
Joe
dress
,
and
the
dinner
dressing
,
and
the
front
door
unlock
(
it
never
be
at
any
other
time
)
for
the
company
to
enter
by
,
and
everything
most
splendid
.
<EOS>
and
still
,
not
a
word
of
the
robbery
.
  
<EOS>
the
time
come
,
without
bring
with
it
any
relief
to
my
feeling
,
and
the
company
come
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
,
unite
to
a
roman
nose
and
a
large
shine
bald
forehead
,
have
a
deep
voice
which
he
be
uncommonly
proud
of
;
indeed
it
be
understand
among
his
acquaintance
that
if
you
could
only
give
him
his
head
,
he
would
read
the
clergyman
into
fit
;
he
himself
confess
that
if
the
Church
be
"
throw
open
,
"
mean
to
competition
,
he
would
not
despair
of
make
his
mark
in
it
.
<EOS>
the
Church
not
be
"
throw
open
,
"
he
be
,
as
I
have
say
,
our
clerk
.
<EOS>
but
he
punish
the
Amens
tremendously
;
and
when
he
give
out
the
psalm
---
always
give
the
whole
verse
---
he
look
all
round
the
congregation
first
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
<EOS>
You
have
hear
my
friend
overhead
;
oblige
me
with
your
opinion
of
this
style
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
open
the
door
to
the
company
---
make
believe
that
it
be
a
habit
of
our
to
open
that
door
---
and
I
open
it
first
to
Mr
Wopsle
,
next
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Hubble
,
and
last
of
all
to
Uncle
Pumblechook
.
<EOS>
NB
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
allow
to
call
him
uncle
,
under
the
severe
penalty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Joe
,
"
say
Uncle
Pumblechook
:
a
large
hard
-
breathe
middle
-
aged
slow
man
,
with
a
mouth
like
a
fish
,
dull
stare
eye
,
and
sandy
hair
stand
upright
on
his
head
,
so
that
he
look
as
if
he
have
just
be
all
but
choke
,
and
have
that
moment
come
to
;
"
I
have
bring
you
,
as
the
compliment
of
the
season
---
I
have
bring
you
,
Mum
,
a
bottle
of
sherry
wine
---
and
I
have
bring
you
,
Mum
,
a
bottle
of
port
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
every
Christmas
Day
he
present
himself
,
as
a
profound
novelty
,
with
exactly
the
same
word
,
and
carry
the
two
bottle
like
dumb
-
bell
.
<EOS>
every
Christmas
Day
,
Mrs
Joe
reply
,
as
she
now
reply
,
"
oh
,
Un
-
cle
pum
-
ble
-
chook
!
<EOS>
this
be
kind
!
"
<EOS>
every
Christmas
Day
,
he
retort
,
as
he
now
retort
,
"
It
be
no
more
than
your
merit
.
<EOS>
and
now
be
you
all
bobbish
,
and
how
be
Sixpennorth
of
halfpence
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
mean
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
dine
on
these
occasion
in
the
kitchen
,
and
adjourn
,
for
the
nut
and
orange
and
apple
,
to
the
parlour
;
which
be
a
change
very
like
Joe
's
change
from
his
work
clothe
to
his
Sunday
dress
.
<EOS>
My
sister
be
uncommonly
lively
on
the
present
occasion
,
and
indeed
be
generally
more
gracious
in
the
society
of
Mrs
Hubble
than
in
other
company
.
<EOS>
I
remember
Mrs
Hubble
as
a
little
curly
sharp
-
edge
person
in
sky
-
blue
,
who
hold
a
conventionally
juvenile
position
,
because
she
have
marry
Mr
Hubble
---
I
do
not
know
at
what
remote
period
---
when
she
be
much
young
than
he
.
<EOS>
I
remember
Mr
Hubble
as
a
tough
high
-
shouldered
stoop
old
man
,
of
a
see
-
dusty
fragrance
,
with
his
leg
extraordinarily
wide
apart
:
so
that
in
my
short
day
I
always
see
some
mile
of
open
country
between
them
when
I
meet
him
come
up
the
lane
.
  
<EOS>
among
this
good
company
I
should
have
feel
myself
,
even
if
I
have
not
rob
the
pantry
,
in
a
false
position
.
<EOS>
not
because
I
be
squeeze
in
at
an
acute
angle
of
the
table
-
cloth
,
with
the
table
in
my
chest
,
and
the
Pumblechookian
elbow
in
my
eye
,
nor
because
I
be
not
allow
to
speak
<EOS>
(
I
do
not
want
to
speak
)
,
nor
because
I
be
regale
with
the
scaly
tip
of
the
drumstick
of
the
fowl
,
and
with
those
obscure
corner
of
pork
of
which
the
pig
,
when
live
,
have
have
the
least
reason
to
be
vain
.
<EOS>
no
;
I
should
not
have
mind
that
,
if
they
would
only
have
leave
me
alone
.
<EOS>
but
they
would
not
leave
me
alone
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
think
the
opportunity
lose
,
if
they
fail
to
point
the
conversation
at
me
,
every
now
and
then
,
and
stick
the
point
into
me
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
be
an
unfortunate
little
bull
in
a
spanish
arena
<EOS>
,
I
get
so
smartingly
touch
up
by
these
moral
goad
.
  
<EOS>
It
begin
the
moment
we
sit
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
say
grace
with
theatrical
declamation
---
as
it
now
appear
to
me
,
something
like
a
religious
cross
of
the
Ghost
in
Hamlet
with
Richard
the
Third
---
and
end
with
the
very
proper
aspiration
that
we
may
be
truly
grateful
.
<EOS>
upon
which
my
sister
fix
me
with
her
eye
,
and
say
,
in
a
low
reproachful
voice
,
"
do
you
hear
that
?
<EOS>
be
grateful
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
especially
,
"
say
Mr
Pumblechook
,
"
be
grateful
,
boy
,
to
them
which
bring
you
up
by
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Hubble
shake
her
head
,
and
contemplate
me
with
a
mournful
presentiment
that
I
should
come
to
no
good
,
ask
,
"
why
be
it
that
the
young
be
never
grateful
?
<EOS>
"
this
moral
mystery
seem
too
much
for
the
company
until
Mr
Hubble
tersely
solve
it
by
say
,
"
naterally
wicious
.
<EOS>
"
everybody
then
murmur
"
true
!
"
and
look
at
me
in
a
particularly
unpleasant
and
personal
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
's
station
and
influence
be
something
feebler
(
if
possible
)
<EOS>
when
there
be
company
,
than
when
there
be
none
.
<EOS>
but
he
always
aid
and
comfort
me
when
he
could
,
in
some
way
of
his
own
,
and
he
always
do
so
at
dinner
-
time
by
give
me
gravy
,
if
there
be
any
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
gravy
to
-
day
,
Joe
spoon
into
my
plate
,
at
this
point
,
about
half
a
pint
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
later
on
in
the
dinner
,
Mr
Wopsle
review
the
sermon
with
some
severity
,
and
intimate
---
in
the
usual
hypothetical
case
of
the
Church
be
"
throw
open
"
---
what
kind
of
sermon
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
he
\
 
would
have
give
them
.
<EOS>
after
favour
them
with
some
head
of
that
discourse
,
he
remark
that
he
consider
the
subject
of
the
day
's
homily
,
ill

choose
;
which
be
the
less
excusable

he
add
,
when
there
be
so
many
subject
"
go
about

"
  
<EOS>
"
true
again

"
say
Uncle
Pumblechook
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
hit
it

"
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
add
,
after
a
short
interval
of
reflection
,
"

return
Mr
Wopsle
;
and
I
know
he
be
go
to
lug
me
in
,
before
he
say
it
;
"
may
be
deduce
from
that
text

"
  
<EOS>
(
"
You

my

to
me

in

severe
parenthesis

some
more

<EOS>
"
Swine

Mr

in
his
deep
voice

his

and
then
enter
on
a
fearful
catalogue
of
all
the
illness
I
have
be
guilty
of

and
all
the
act
of
sleeplessness
I
have
commit

myself

all

have
wish
me

I

contumaciously

I
think
the
Romans
must

aggravate
one
another
very
much

with

perhaps

they
become
the

Mr

that
I

howl

<EOS>
but
,
all
I
have
endure
up
to

be
nothing

with
the
awful

take
possession
of
me
when
the
pause
be
break
which
ensue
upon
my

recital

in
which
pause
everybody
have
look

painfully

indignation

abhorrence

yet

Mr

tight
to
the
leg

my
fate

<EOS>
My

come
back
with
the
stone
bottle

and
pour
his
brandy
out

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
the
wretched

trifle
with
his

take
it
up

through

down

prolong
my

<EOS>
all
this

<EOS>
I
could
not

off
him

<EOS>
always
hold
tight
by
the
leg
of
the

with
my
hand
and
foot
,
I
see
the
miserable
creature
finger
his
glass
playfully
,
take
it
up
,
smile
,
throw
his
head
back
,
and
drink
the
brandy
off

<EOS>
instantly
afterwards
,
the

be
seize
with
unspeakable
consternation

owe
to
his
springing
to

turn
round
several
time
in
an
appalling
spasmodic
whooping
-
cough
dance
,
and
rush
out
at
the
door
;
he
then
become
visible
through
the
window
,
violently
plunge
and
expectorate
,
make
the
most
hideous
face
,
and
apparently
out
of
his

.
  
<EOS>
I
hold
on
tight
,
while
Mrs

and
Joe
run
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
I
have
do
it
,
but
I
have
no

I
have
murder
him
somehow
.
<EOS>
in
my
dreadful
situation

it
be
a
relief
when
he
be
bring
back
,
and
,
survey
the
company
all
round
as
if
 
\
<EOS>
they
\
 
<EOS>
have
disagree
with
him
,
sink
down
into
his
chair
with
the
one
significant
gasp
,
"
Tar

"
  
<EOS>
I
have
fill
up
the
bottle
from
the
tar

water
jug
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
be
bad
by

and

<EOS>
I
move
the
table
,
like
a
medium
of
the
present
day
,
by
the
vigour
of
my
unseen
hold
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tar

cry
my

,
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
why

how
ever
could
Tar

"
  
<EOS>
but
,
Uncle
Pumblechook
,
who
be
omnipotent
in
that
kitchen
,
would
not
hear
the
word
,
would
not
hear
of
the
subject
,
imperiously
wave
it
all
away
with
his
hand
,
and
ask
for
hot
gin
-
and

water
.
<EOS>
My

who
have
begin

be
alarmingly
meditative

actively

<EOS>
for
the
time
at

,
I
be
save

<EOS>
I
still
hold
on
to
the
leg
of
the
table
,
but
clutch
it
now
with
the
fervour
of
gratitude
.
  
<EOS>
by
degree
,
I
become
calm
enough
to
release
my
grasp
and
partake
of
pudding
.
<EOS>
Mr

partook
of
pudding
.
<EOS>
all
partook

and
Mr

have
begin
to
beam
under
the
genial
influence
of
gin

and

water

<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
I
should
get
over
the
day
,
when
my

say
to
Joe
,
"
clean
plate

cold

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
clutch
the
leg
of
the

again
immediately

press
it
to
my
bosom
as
if
it
have
be
the
companion
of
my
youth
and
friend
of

<EOS>
I
foresaw
what
be
come

"

<EOS>
My

out
to

<EOS>
I
hear
her
step

to
the
pantry

<EOS>
I

Mr

balance
his

<EOS>
I
see
re

awaken
appetite
in

<EOS>
I
hear
Mr

remark
that

would
lay

I

"
You

I
have
never
be
absolutely
certain
whether
I
utter
a
shrill
yell
of
terror
,
merely
in
spirit
,
or
in
the
bodily
hearing
of
the
company

<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
could
bear
no
more

that
I
must
run
away
.
<EOS>
I
release
the
leg
of
the

and
run
for
my
life

<EOS>
but
,
I
run
no
further
than
the
house

for
there
I
run
head
foremost
into
a
party
of
soldier
with
their

one

hold
out
a

<EOS>
the

I

in
the
kitchen
when
Mrs

stand
stare
;
at
which
crisis
<EOS>
I
partially
recover

<EOS>
It

with
his

invitingly
extend
towards

<EOS>
"

as
I

mention
at

smart
young
shaver

(
which
he

not

,
"
I

I
want
the

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
receive
as
rather
neat
in
the
sergeant
;
insomuch
that
Mr
Pumblechook
cry
audibly
,
"
good
again

"
  
<EOS>
"
You

say
the

have
by

out
Joe
with
his

we
have
have
an

not

pretty

will
you
throw
your

over

"
  
<EOS>
Joe
throw
his
eye
over
them
,
and
pronounce
that
the
job
would
necessitate
the
lighting
of
his
forge
fire
,
and
would
take
near
two
hour
than
one
,
"
Will
it
?
<EOS>
then
will
you
set
about
it
at
once

"
say
the
off

hand
sergeant
,
"
as
it
be
on
his
Majesty

if
my

with
that

he
call
to
his

who
come
troop
into
the
kitchen
one
after
another
,
and
pile
their
arm
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
and
then
they
stand
about
,
as
soldier
do
;
now
,
with
their
hand
loosely
clasp
before
them

now
,
rest
a
knee

now
,
ease
a

a

now

open
the

spit
stiffly
over

out
into

all
these

I

without

I
see
them

for
<EOS>
I
be
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
.
<EOS>
but
,
begin
to
perceive
that
the
handcuff
be
not
for
me
,
and
that
the
military
have
so
far
get
the
well
of
the
pie
as
to
put
it
in
the
background
,
I
collect
a
little
more
of

scatter

"
Would

himself
to
Mr

appreciative
power
justify

notice
that
Mr

appear
to
forget

terrible
good

They

not
enjoy

rise

sink

the
red

hot

drop

die

the
pale
afternoon
outside

almost

he
muster
courage
to
propose
that
some
of
us
should
go
down
with
the
soldier
and
see
what
come
of
the
hunt
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
and
Mr
Hubble
decline
,
on
the
plea
of
a
pipe
and
lady
'
society
;
but
Mr
Wopsle
say
he
would
go
,
if
Joe
would
.
<EOS>
Joe
say
he
be
agreeable
,
and
would
take
me
,
if
Mrs
Joe
approve
.
<EOS>
We
never
should
have
get
leave
to
go
,
I
be
sure
,
but
for
Mrs
Joe
's
curiosity
to
know
all
about
it
and
how
it
end
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
merely
stipulate
,
"
if
you
bring
the
boy
back
with
his
head
blow
to
bit
by
a
musket
,
do
not
look
to
me
to
put
it
together
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
sergeant
take
a
polite
leave
of
the
lady
,
and
part
from
Mr
Pumblechook
as
from
a
comrade
;
though
I
doubt
if
he
be
quite
as
fully
sensible
of
that
gentleman
's
merit
under
arid
condition
,
as
when
something
moist
be
go
.
<EOS>
His
man
resume
their
musket
and
fall
in
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
,
Joe
,
and
I
,
receive
strict
charge
to
keep
in
the
rear
,
and
to
speak
no
word
after
we
reach
the
marsh
.
<EOS>
when
we
be
all
out
in
the
raw
air
and
be
steadily
move
towards
our
business
,
I
treasonably
whisper
to
Joe
,
"
I
hope
,
Joe
,
we
shall
not
find
them
.
"
<EOS>
and
Joe
whisper
to
me
,
"
I
would
give
a
shilling
if
they
have
cut
and
run
,
Pip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
be
join
by
no
straggler
from
the
village
,
for
the
weather
be
cold
and
threatening
,
<EOS>
the
way
dreary
,
the
foot
bad
,
darkness
come
on
,
and
the
people
have
good
fire
in
-
door
and
be
keep
the
day
.
<EOS>
a
few
face
hurry
to
glow
window
and
look
after
us
,
but
none
come
out
.
<EOS>
We
pass
the
finger
-
post
,
and
hold
straight
on
to
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
there
,
we
be
stop
a
few
minute
by
a
signal
from
the
sergeant
's
hand
,
while
two
or
three
of
his
man
disperse
themselves
among
the
grave
,
and
also
examine
the
porch
.
<EOS>
They
come
in
again
without
find
anything
,
and
then
we
strike
out
on
the
open
marsh
,
through
the
gate
at
the
side
of
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
a
bitter
sleet
come
rattle
against
us
here
on
the
east
wind
,
and
Joe
take
me
on
his
back
.
  
<EOS>
now
that
we
be
out
upon
the
dismal
wilderness
where
they
little
think
I
have
be
within
eight
or
nine
hour
and
have
see
both
man
hide
,
I
consider
for
the
first
time
,
with
great
dread
,
if
we
should
come
upon
them
,
would
my
particular
convict
suppose
that
it
be
I
who
have
bring
the
soldier
there
?
<EOS>
He
have
ask
me
if
I
be
a
deceiving
imp
,
and
he
have
say
I
should
be
a
fierce
young
hound
if
I
join
the
hunt
against
him
.
<EOS>
Would
he
believe
that
I
be
both
imp
and
hound
in
treacherous
earnest
,
and
have
betray
him
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
ask
myself
this
question
now
.
<EOS>
there
I
be
,
on
Joe
's
back
,
and
there
be
Joe
beneath
me
,
charge
at
the
ditch
like
a
hunter
,
and
stimulate
Mr
Wopsle
not
to
tumble
on
his
roman
nose
,
and
to
keep
up
with
us
.
<EOS>
the
soldier
be
in
front
of
us
,
extend
into
a
pretty
wide
line
with
an
interval
between
man
and
man
.
<EOS>
We
be
take
the
course
I
have
begin
with
,
and
from
which
I
have
diverge
in
the
mist
.
<EOS>
either
the
mist
be
not
out
again
yet
,
or
the
wind
have
dispel
it
.
<EOS>
under
the
low
ted
glare
of
sunset
,
the
beacon
,
and
the
gibbet
,
and
the
mound
of
the
Battery
,
and
the
opposite
shore
of
the
river
,
be
plain
,
though
all
of
a
watery
lead
colour
.
  
<EOS>
with
my
heart
thump
like
a
blacksmith
at
Joe
's
broad
shoulder
,
I
look
all
about
for
any
sign
of
the
convict
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
none
,
I
could
hear
none
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
have
greatly
alarm
me
more
than
once
,
by
his
blowing
and
hard
breathing
;
but
I
know
the
sound
by
this
time
,
and
could
dissociate
them
from
the
object
of
pursuit
.
<EOS>
I
get
a
dreadful
start
,
when
I
think
I
hear
the
file
still
go
;
but
it
be
only
a
sheep
bell
.
<EOS>
the
sheep
stop
in
their
eating
and
look
timidly
at
us
;
and
the
cattle
,
their
head
turn
from
the
wind
and
sleet
,
stare
angrily
as
if
they
hold
us
responsible
for
both
annoyance
;
but
,
except
these
thing
,
and
the
shudder
of
the
die
day
in
every
blade
of
grass
,
there
be
no
break
in
the
bleak
stillness
of
the
marsh
.
  
<EOS>
the
soldier
be
move
on
in
the
direction
of
the
old
Battery
,
and
we
be
move
on
a
little
way
behind
them
,
when
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
we
all
stop
.
<EOS>
for
,
there
have
reach
us
on
the
wing
of
the
wind
and
rain
,
a
long
shout
.
<EOS>
It
be
repeat
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
a
distance
towards
the
east
,
but
it
be
long
and
loud
.
<EOS>
nay
,
there
seem
to
be
two
or
more
shout
raise
together
---
if
one
may
judge
from
a
confusion
in
the
sound
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
effect
the
sergeant
and
the
near
man
be
speak
under
their
breath
,
when
Joe
and
I
come
up
.
<EOS>
after
another
moment
's
listening
,
Joe
(
who
be
a
good
judge
)
agree
,
and
Mr
Wopsle
(
who
be
a
bad
judge
)
agree
.
<EOS>
the
sergeant
,
a
decisive
man
,
order
that
the
sound
should
not
be
answer
,
but
that
the
course
should
be
change
,
and
that
his
man
should
make
towards
it
"
at
the
double
.
"
<EOS>
so
we
slant
to
the
right
(
where
the
East
be
)
,
and
Joe
pound
away
so
wonderfully
,
that
I
have
to
hold
on
tight
to
keep
my
seat
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
run
indeed
now
,
and
what
Joe
call
,
in
the
only
two
word
he
speak
all
the
time
,
"
a
Winder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
down
bank
and
up
bank
,
and
over
gate
,
and
splash
into
dyke
,
and
break
among
coarse
rush
:
<EOS>
no
man
care
where
he
go
.
<EOS>
as
we
come
nearer
to
the
shouting
,
it
become
more
and
more
apparent
that
it
be
make
by
more
than
one
voice
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
it
seem
to
stop
altogether
,
and
then
the
soldier
stop
.
<EOS>
when
it
break
out
again
,
the
soldier
make
for
it
at
a
great
rate
than
ever
,
and
we
after
them
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
,
we
have
so
run
it
down
,
that
we
could
hear
one
voice
call
"
murder
!
"
<EOS>
and
another
voice
,
"
convict
!
<EOS>
runaway
!
<EOS>
Guard
!
<EOS>
this
way
for
the
runaway
convict
!
<EOS>
"
then
both
voice
would
seem
to
be
stifle
in
a
struggle
,
and
then
would
break
out
again
.
<EOS>
and
when
it
have
come
to
this
,
the
soldier
run
like
deer
,
and
Joe
too
.
  
<EOS>
the
sergeant
run
in
first
,
when
we
have
run
the
noise
quite
down
,
and
two
of
his
man
run
in
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Their
piece
be
cock
and
level
when
we
all
run
in

<EOS>
"
here

the

at
the
bottom
of

<EOS>
"

,
you
two

and
confound
you
for
two
wild
beast

asunder

"
  
<EOS>
water
be
splash
,
and
mud
be
fly
,
and
oath
be
be
swear
,
and
blow
be
be

,
when
some
more
man
go
down
into
the
ditch
to
help
the
sergeant
,
and
drag
out
,
separately
,
my
convict
and
the
other
one
.
<EOS>
both
be
bleed
and
pant
and
execrating
and
struggle
;
but
of
course
I
know
them
both
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
mind
!
"
say
my
convict
,
wipe
blood
from
his
face
with
his
ragged
sleeve
,
and
shake
tear
hair
from
his
finger

the

livid
to
look
at
,
and
,
in
addition
to
the
old
bruise
left
side
of
his
face
,
seem
to
be
bruise
and
tear
all
over

<EOS>
He
could
not
so
much
as
get
his
breath
to
speak
,
until
they
be
both
separately
handcuff
,

lean
upon
a
soldier
to
keep
himself
from
fall

curious

ever
afterwards
,
as
have
be
more
attentive
.
  
<EOS>
the
soldier
with
the
basket
soon
get
a
light
,
and
light
three
or
four
torch
,
and
take
one
himself
and
distribute
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
almost
dark
before
,
but
now
it
seem
quite
dark
,
and
soon
afterwards
very
dark
.
<EOS>
before
we
depart
from
that
spot
,
four
soldier
stand
in
a
ring
,
fire
twice
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
presently
we
see
other
torch
kindle
at
some
distance
behind
us
,
and
other
on
the
marsh
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
"
say
the
sergeant
.

March

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
have
not
go
far
when
three
cannon
be
fire
ahead
of
us
with
a
sound
that
seem
to
burst
something
inside
my
ear
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
expect
on
board
,
"
say
the
sergeant
to
my
convict
;
"
they
know
you
be
come
.
<EOS>
do
not
straggle
,
my
man
.
<EOS>
close
up
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
two
be
keep
apart
,
and
each
walk
surround
by
a
separate
guard
.
<EOS>
I
have
hold
of
Joe
's
hand
now
,
and
Joe
carry
one
of
the
torch
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
have
be
for
go
back
,
but
Joe
be
resolve
to
see
it
out
,
so
we
go
on
with
the
party
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
reasonably
good
path
now
,
mostly
on
the
edge
of
the
river
,
with
a
divergence
here
and
there
where
a
dyke
come
,
with
a
miniature
windmill
on
it
and
a
muddy
sluice
-
gate
.
<EOS>
when
I
look
round
,
I
could
see
the
other
light
come
in
after
us
.
<EOS>
the
torch
we
carry
,
drop
great
blotch
of
fire
upon
the
track
,
and
I
could
see
those
,
too
,
lie
smoke
and
flaring
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
nothing
else
but
black
darkness
.
<EOS>
Our
light
warm
the
air
about
us
with
their
pitchy
blaze
,
and
the
two
prisoner
seem
rather
to
like
that
,
as
they
limp
along
in
the
midst
of
the
musket
.
<EOS>
We
could
not
go
fast
,
because
of
their
lameness
;
and
they
be
so
spend
,
that
two
or
three
time
we
have
to
halt
while
they
rest
.
  
<EOS>
after
an
hour
or
so
of
this
travelling
,
we
come
to
a
rough
wooden
hut
and
a
landing
-
place
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
guard
in
the
hut
,
and
they
challenge
,
and
the
sergeant
answer
.
<EOS>
then
,
we
go
into
the
hut
where
there
be
a
smell
of
tobacco
and
whitewash
,
and
a
bright
fire
,
and
a
lamp
,
and
a
stand
of
musket
,
and
a
drum
,
and
a
low
wooden
bedstead
,
like
an
overgrown
mangle
without
the
machinery
,
capable
of
hold
about
a
dozen
soldier
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
three
or
four
soldier
who
lie
upon
it
in
their
great
-
coat
,
be
not
much
interested
in
us
,
but
just
lift
their
head
and
take
a
sleepy
stare
,
and
then
lie
down
again
.
<EOS>
the
sergeant
make
some
kind
of
report
,
and
some
entry
in
a
book
,
and
then
the
convict
whom
I
call
the
other
convict
be
draft
off
with
his
guard
,
to
go
on
board
first
.
  
<EOS>
My
convict
never
look
at
me
,
except
that
once
.
<EOS>
while
we
stand
in
the
hut
,
he
stand
before
the
fire
look
thoughtfully
at
it
,
or
put
up
his
foot
by
turn
upon
the
hob
,
and
look
thoughtfully
at
them
as
if
he
pity
them
for
their
recent
adventure
.
<EOS>
suddenly
,
he
turn
to
the
sergeant
,
and
remark
:
  
"
I
wish
to
say
something
respect
this
escape
.
<EOS>
It
may
prevent
some
person

under
suspicion

<EOS>
"
You
can
say
what
you
like

"
return
the
sergeant
,
stand
coolly
look
at
him
with
his
arm
fold
,
"
but
you
have
no
call
to
say
it
here
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
opportunity
enough
to
say
about
it
,
and
hear
about
it
,
before
it
be
do
with
,
you
know

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
but
this
be
another
pint
,
a
separate
matter
.
<EOS>
a
man
can
not
starve
;
at

I
can
not

<EOS>
I
take
some
wittle

up

the
willage
over
yonder

<EOS>
"

Joe

stare
at
me

<EOS>

It

turn
his

without

at

"
God

Joe

with
a

remembrance
of
Mrs

<EOS>

We

"
  
<EOS>
the
something
that
I
have
notice
before
,
click
in
the
man
's
throat
again
,
and
he
turn
his
back
.
<EOS>
the
boat
have
return
,
and
his
guard
be
ready
,
so
we
follow
him
to
the
landing
-
place
make
of
rough
stake
and
stone
,
and
see
him
put
into
the
boat

which
be
row
by
a
crew
of
convict

himself

<EOS>
no
one
seem

glad

that
somebody
in

boat
growl
as
if
to
dog
,
"
give
way

you

<EOS>
which
be
the
signal
for
the
dip
of
the
oar
.
<EOS>
by
the
light
of
the
torch
,
we
see
the
black
Hulk
lie
out
a
little
way
from
the
mud
of
the
shore
,
like
a
wicked
Noah

ark

crib

massive
rusty

<EOS>
,
the
prison

seem
in

young

to
be
iron

prisoner

<EOS>
We
see
the
boat
go
alongside
,
and
we
see
him
take
up
the
side
and
disappear
.
<EOS>
then
,
the
end
of
the
torch
be
fling
hiss
into

chapter
6
 
<EOS>
My
state
of
mind
regard
the
pilfering
from
which
I
have
be
so
unexpectedly
exonerate
,
do
not
impel
me
to
frank
disclosure
;
but
I
hope
it
have
some
dreg
of
good
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
recall
that
I
feel
any
tenderness
of
conscience
in
reference
to
Mrs
Joe
,
when
the
fear
of
be
find
out
be
lift
off
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
love
Joe
---
perhaps
for
no
well
reason
in
those
early
day
than
because
the
dear
fellow
let
me
love
him
---
and
,
as
to
him
,
my
inner
self
be
not
so
easily
compose
.
<EOS>
It
be
much
upon
my
mind
(
particularly
when
I
first
see
him
look
about
for
his
file
)
that
I
ought
to
tell
Joe
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
yet
I
do
not
,
and
for
the
reason
that
I
mistrust
that
if
I
do
,
he
would
think
me
worse
than
I
be
.
<EOS>
the
fear
of
lose
Joe
's
confidence
,
and
of
thenceforth
sit
in
the
chimney
-
corner
at
night
stare
drearily
at
my
for
ever
lose
companion
and
friend
,
tie
up
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
I
morbidly
represent
to
myself
that
if
Joe
know
it
,
I
never
afterwards
could
see
him
at
the
fireside
feel
his
fair
whisker
,
without
think
that
he
be
meditate
on
it
.
<EOS>
that
,
if
Joe
know
it
,
I
never
afterwards
could
see
him
glance
,
however
casually
,
at
yesterday
's
meat
or
pudding
when
it
come
on
to
-
day
's
table
,
without
think
that
he
be
debate
whether
I
have
be
in
the
pantry
.
<EOS>
that
,
if
Joe
know
it
,
and
at
any
subsequent
period
of
our
joint
domestic
life
remark
that
his
beer
be
flat
or
thick
,
the
conviction
that
he
suspect
Tar
in
it
,
would
bring
a
rush
of
blood
to
my
face
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
be
too
cowardly
to
do
what
I
know
to
be
right
,
as
I
have
be
too
cowardly
to
avoid
do
what
I
know
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
no
intercourse
with
the
world
at
that
time
,
and
I
imitate
none
of
its
many
inhabitant
who
act
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
quite
an
untaught
genius
,
I
make
the
discovery
of
the
line
of
action
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
be
sleepy
before
we
be
far
away
from
the
prison
-
ship
,
Joe
take
me
on
his
back
again
and
carry
me
home
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
have
a
tiresome
journey
of
it
,
for
Mr
Wopsle
,
be
knock
up
,
be
in
such
a
very
bad
temper
that
if
the
Church
have
be
throw
open
,
he
would
probably
have
excommunicate
the
whole
expedition
,
begin
with
Joe
and
myself
.
<EOS>
in
his
lay
capacity
,
he
persist
in
sit
down
in
the
damp
to
such
an
insane
extent
,
that
when
his
coat
be
take
off
to
be
dry
at
the
kitchen
fire
,
the
circumstantial
evidence
on
his
trouser
would
have
hang
him
if
it
have
be
a
capital
offence
.
  
<EOS>
by
that
time
,
I
be
staggering
on
the
kitchen
floor
like
a
little
drunkard
,
through
have
be
newly
set
upon
my
foot
,
and
through
have
be
fast
asleep
,
and
through
wake
in
the
heat
and
light
and
noise
of
tongue
.
<EOS>
as
I
come
to
myself
(
with
the
aid
of
a
heavy
thump
between
the
shoulder
,
and
the
restorative
exclamation
"
Yah
!
<EOS>
be
there
ever
such
a
boy
as
this
!
"
<EOS>
from
my
sister
)
,
I
find
Joe
tell
them
about
the
convict
's
confession
,
and
all
the
visitor
suggest
different
way
by
which
he
have
get
into
the
pantry
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
make
out
,
after
carefully
survey
the
premise
,
that
he
have
first
get
upon
the
roof
of
the
forge
,
and
have
then
get
upon
the
roof
of
the
house
,
and
have
then
let
himself
down
the
kitchen
chimney
by
a
rope
make
of
his
bedding
cut
into
strip
;
and
as
Mr
Pumblechook
be
very
positive
and
drive
his
own
chaise
-
cart
---
over
everybody
<EOS>
---
it
be
agree
that
it
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
,
indeed
,
wildly
cry
out
"
no
!
"
<EOS>
with
the
feeble
malice
of
a
tired
man
;
but
,
as
he
have
no
theory
,
and
no
coat
on
,
he
be
unanimously
set
at
nought
---
not
to
mention
his
smoking
hard
behind
,
as
he
stand
with
his
back
to
the
kitchen
fire
to
draw
the
damp
out
:
which
be
not
calculate
to
inspire
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
I
hear
that
night
before
my
sister
clutch
me
,
as
a
slumberous
offence
to
the
company
's
eyesight
,
and
assist
me
up
to
bed
with
such
a
strong
hand
that
I
seem
to
have
fifty
boot
on
,
and
to
be
dangle
them
all
against
the
edge
of
the
stair
.
<EOS>
My
state
of
mind
,
as
I
have
describe
it
,
begin
before
I
be
up
in
the
morning
,
and
last
long
after
the
subject
have
die
out
,
and
have
cease
to
be
mention
save
on
exceptional
occasion

Chapter
7
 
at
<EOS>
the
time
when
I
stand
in
the
churchyard
,
read
the
family
tombstone
<EOS>
,
I
have
just
enough
learn
to
be
able
to
spell
them
out
.
<EOS>
My
construction
even
of
their
simple
meaning
be
not
very
correct
,
for
I
read
"
wife
of
the
Above
"
as
a
complimentary
reference
to
my
father
's
exaltation
to
a
well
world
;
and
if
any
one
of
my
deceased
relation
have
be
refer
to
as
"
below
,
"
I
have
no
doubt
I
should
have
form
the
bad
opinion
of
that
member
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
neither
,
be
my
notion
of
the
theological
position
to
which
my
Catechism
bind
me
,
at
all
accurate
;
for
,
I
have
a
lively
remembrance
that
I
suppose
my
declaration
that
I
be
to
"
walk
in
the
same
all
the
day
of
my
life
,
"
lay
me
under
an
obligation
always
to
go
through
the
village
from
our
house
in
one
particular
direction
,
and
never
to
vary
it
by
turn
down
by
the
wheelwright
's
or
up
by
the
mill
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
old
enough
,
I
be
to
be
apprentice
to
Joe
,
and
until
I
could
assume
that
dignity
<EOS>
I
be
not
to
be
what
Mrs
Joe
call
"
pompeye
,
"
<EOS>
or
(
as
I
render
it
)
pamper
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
I
be
not
only
odd
-
boy
about
the
forge
,
but
if
any
neighbour
happen
to
want
an
extra
boy
to
frighten
bird
,
or
pick
up
stone
,
or
do
any
such
job
,
I
be
favour
with
the
employment
.
<EOS>
in
order
,
however
.
<EOS>
that
our
superior
position
may
not
be
compromise
thereby
,
a

be
keep
on

my

drop

<EOS>
I
have
an
impression
that
they
be
to
be
contribute
eventually
towards
the
liquidation
of
the
National
Debt
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
no

of
any
personal
participation
in

Mr

from
six
to
seven
every
evening
,
in
the
society
of
youth
who
pay
twopence
per
week
each
,
for
the
improve
opportunity
of
see
her
do
it
.
<EOS>
She
rent
a
small
cottage
,
and
Mr
Wopsle
have
the
room
up
-
stair
,
where
we
student
use
to
overhear
him
read
aloud
in
a
most
dignified
and
terrific
manner
,
and
occasionally
bumping
on
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
fiction
that
Mr
Wopsle
"
examine
"
the
scholar
,
once
a
quarter
.
<EOS>
what
he
do
on
those
occasion
be
to
turn
up
his
cuff
,
stick
up
his
hair
,
and
give
us
Mark
Antony
's
oration
over
the
body
of
Caesar
.
<EOS>
this
be
always
follow
by
Collins
's
Ode
on
the
Passions
,
wherein
I
particularly
venerate
Mr
Wopsle
as
revenge
,
throw
his
blood
-
stain
sword
in
thunder
down
,
and
take
the
war
-
denounce
trumpet
with
a
withering
look
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
with
me
then
,
as
it
be
in
later
life
,
when
I
fall
into
the
society
of
the
passion
,
and
compare
them
with
Collins
and
Wopsle
,
rather
to
the
disadvantage
of
both
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
,
besides
keep
this
Educational
Institution
,
keep
---
in
the
same
room
---
a
little
general
shop
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
idea
what
stock
she
have
,
or
what
the
price
of
anything
in
it
be
;
but
there
be
a
little
greasy
memorandum
-
book
keep
in
a
drawer
,
which
serve
as
a
catalogue
of
price
,
and
by
this
oracle
Biddy
arrange
all
the
shop
transaction
.
<EOS>
Biddy
be
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
's
granddaughter
;
I
confess
myself
quite
unequal
to
the
working
out
of
the
problem
,
what
relation
she
be
to
Mr
Wopsle
.
<EOS>
She
be
an
orphan
like
myself
;
like
me
,
too
,
have
be
bring
up
by
hand
.
<EOS>
She
be
most
noticeable
,
I
think
,
in
respect
of
her
extremity
;
for
,
her
hair
always
want
brush
,
her
hand
always
want
washing
,
and
her
shoe
always
want
mend
and
pull
up
at
heel
.
<EOS>
this
description
must
be
receive
with
a
week
-
day
limitation
.
<EOS>
on
Sundays
,
she
go
to
church
elaborate
.
  
<EOS>
much
of
my
unassisted
self
,
and
more
by
the
help
of
Biddy
than
of
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
,
I
struggle
through
the
alphabet
as
if
it
have
be
a
bramble
-
bush
;
get
considerably
worry
and
scratch
by
every
letter
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
I
fall
among
those
thief
,
the
nine
figure
,
who
seem
every
evening
to
do
something
new
to
disguise
themselves
and
baffle
recognition
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
last
I
begin
,
in
a
purblind
grope
way
,
to
read
,
write
,
and
cipher
,
on
the
very
small

<EOS>
one
night
,
I
be
sit
in

corner
with
my

expend
great
effort
on
the
production
of
a
letter
to
Joe

<EOS>
I
think
it
must
have
be
a
full
year
after
our
hunt
upon
the
marsh
,
for
it
be
a
long
time
after
,
and
it
be
winter
and
a
hard
frost
.
<EOS>
with
an
alphabet
on
the
hearth
at
my
foot
for
reference

I
contrive
in
an
hour
or
two
to
print

good

make
such
a
row
at

house

we

obligate

have
no

up

him

that

of

Pip

and
this
I
want
to
say
very
serous
to
you

old
chap

I
see
so
much
in
my
poor
mother
,
of
a
woman
drudge
and
slave
and
break
her
honest
hart
and
never
get
no
peace
in
her
mortal
day

that
I
be
dead
afeerd
of
go
wrong
in
the
way
of
not
do
what
be
  
<EOS>
right
by
a
woman
,
and
I
would
fur
rather
of
the
two
<EOS>
go
wrong
the
  
t'other
way
,
and
be
a
little
ill
-
conwenience
myself
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
be
  
<EOS>
only
me
that
get
put
out
,
Pip

;
I
wish
there
warn't
<EOS>
no
tickler
for
you
,
old
chap
<EOS>
;
I
wish
I
could
take
it
all
on
myself
;
but
this
be
the
up
-
and
-
down
-
and
-
straight
on
it
,
Pip

and
I
hope
you
will
overlook
shortcoming

<EOS>
Young
as
I
be
<EOS>
,
I
believe
that
I
date
a
new
admiration
of
Joe
from
that
night
.
<EOS>
We
be
equal
afterwards
,
as
we
have
be
before
;
but
,
afterwards
at
quiet
time
when
I
sit
look
at
Joe
and
think
about
him
,
I
have
a
new
sensation
of
feel
conscious
that
I
be
look
up
to
Joe
in
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
however
,
"
say
Joe
,
rise
to
replenish
the
fire
;
"
here
be
the
Dutch

clock
a
working
himself
up
to
be
equal
to
strike
eight
of
'em

she
be
not
come
home
yet

I
hope
Uncle
Pumblechook

mare
may
not
have
set

a
fore

foot
on
a
piece
o

ice
,

down

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Joe
make
occasional
trip
with
Uncle
Pumblechook
on
market
-
day
,
to
assist
him
in
buy
such
household
stuff
and
good
as
require
a
woman
's
judgment
;
Uncle
Pumblechook
be
a
bachelor
and
repose
no
confidence
in
his
domestic
servant

<EOS>
this
be
market
-
day
,

Mrs

be
out
on
one
of
these
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
make
the
fire
and
sweep
the
hearth
,
and
then
we
go
to
the
door
to
listen
for
the
chaise
-
cart
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dry
cold
night
,
and
the
wind
blow
keenly
,
and
the
frost
be
white
and
hard
.
<EOS>
a
man
would
die
to
-
night
of
lie
out
on
the
marsh
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
look
at
the
star
,
and
consider
how
awful
it
would
be
for
a
man
to
turn
his
face
up
to
them
as
he
freeze
to
death
,
and
see
no
help
or
pity
in
all
the
glitter
multitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
come
the
mare
,
"
say
Joe
,
"
ring
like
a
peal
of
bell
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
sound
of
her
iron
shoe
upon
the
hard
road
be
quite
musical
,
as
she
come
along
at
a
much
brisker
trot
than
usual
.
<EOS>
We
get
a
chair
out
,
ready
for
Mrs
Joe
's
alighting
,
and
stir
up
the
fire
that
they
may
see
a
bright
window
,
and
take
a
final
survey
of
the
kitchen
that
nothing
may
be
out
of
its
place
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
complete
these
preparation
,
they
drive
up

wrap

<EOS>
Mrs

be
soon

soon
down
too

cover
the

with
a
cloth

and
we
be
soon
all
in
the
kitchen
,
carry
so
much
cold
air
in
with
us
that
it
seem
to
drive
all
the
heat
out
of
the
fire

<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
Mrs

,
unwrap
herself
with
haste

excitement
,
and
throw
her
bonnet
back
on
her
shoulder
where
it
hang

I
look

MR
PUMBLECHOOK
's
premise
in
the
high
-
street
of
the
market
town
,
be
of
a
peppercorny
and
farinaceous
character
,
as
the
premise
of
a
corn
-
chandler
and
seedsman
should
be
.
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
that
he
must
be
a
very
happy
man
indeed
,
to
have
so
many
little
drawer
in
his
shop
;
and
I
wonder
when
I
peep
into
one
or
two
on
the
low
tier
,
and
see
the
tie
-
up
brown
paper
packet
inside
,
whether
the
flower

seed
and
bulb
ever
want
of
a
fine
day
to
break
out
of

and
bloom
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
early
morning
after
my
arrival
that
I
entertain
this
speculation
.
<EOS>
on
the
previous
night
,
I
have
be
send
straight
to
bed
in
an
attic
with
a
sloping
roof
,
which
be
so
low
in
the
corner
where
the
bedstead
be
,
that
I
calculate
the
tile
as
be
within
a
foot
of
my
eyebrow
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
early
morning
,
I
discover
a
singular
affinity
between
seed
and
corduroy
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
wear
corduroy
,
and
so
do
his
shopman
;
and
somehow
,
there
be
a
general
air
and
flavour
about
the
corduroy
,
so
much
in
the
nature
of
seed
,
and
a
general
air
and
flavour
about
the
seed
,
so
much
in
the
nature
of
corduroy
,
that
I
hardly
know
which
be
which
.
<EOS>
the
same
opportunity
serve
me
for
notice
that
Mr
Pumblechook
appear
to
conduct
his
business
by
look
across
the
street
at
the
saddler
,
who
appear
to
transact
his
business
by
keep
his
eye
on
the
coach
-
maker
,
who
appear
to
get
on
in
life
by
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
contemplate
the
baker
,
who
in
his
turn
fold
his
arm
and
stare
at
the
grocer
,
who
stand
at
his
door
and
yawn
at
the
chemist
.
<EOS>
the
watchmaker
,
always
pore
over
a
little
desk
with
a
magnify
glass
at
his
eye
,
and
always
inspect
by
a
group
of
smock
-
frock
pore
over
him
through
the
glass
of
his
shop
-
window
,
seem
to
be
about
the
only
person
in
the
high
-
street
whose
trade
engage
his
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
and
I
breakfast
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
parlour
behind
the
shop
,
while
the
shopman
take
his
mug
of
tea
and
hunch
of
bread
-
and
-
butter
on
a
sack
of
pea
in
the
front
premise
.
<EOS>
I
consider
Mr
Pumblechook
wretche
company
.
<EOS>
besides
be
possess
by
my
sister
's
idea
that
a
mortifying
and
penitential
character
ought
to
be
impart
to
my
diet
---
besides
give
me
as
much
crumb
as
possible
in
combination
with
as
little
butter
,
and
put
such
a
quantity
of
warm
water
into
my
milk
that
it
would
have
be
more
candid
to
have
leave
the
milk
out
altogether
---
his
conversation
consist
of
nothing
but
arithmetic
.
<EOS>
on
my
politely
bid
him
good
morning
,
he
say
,
pompously
,
"
seven
time
nine
,
boy
?
"
<EOS>
and
how
should
I
be
able
to
answer
,
dodge
in
that
way
,
in
a
strange
place
,
on
an
empty
stomach
!
<EOS>
I
be
hungry
,
but
before
I
have
swallow
a
morsel
,
he
begin
a
run
sum
that
last
all
through
the
breakfast
.
"
<EOS>
seven
?
"
<EOS>
"
and
four
?
"
<EOS>
"
and
eight
?
"
<EOS>
"
and
six
?
"
<EOS>
"
and
two
?
"
<EOS>
"
and
ten
?
"
<EOS>
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
and
after
each
figure
be
dispose
of
,
it
be
as
much
as
I
could
do
to
get
a
bite
or
a
sup
,
before
the
next
come
;
while
he
sit
at
his
ease
guess
nothing
,
and
eat
bacon
and
hot
roll
,
in
(
if
I
may
be
allow
the
expression
)
a
gorging
and
gormandising
manner
.
  
<EOS>
for
such
reason
I
be
very
glad
when
ten
o'clock
come
and
we
start
for
Miss
Havisham
's
;
though
I
be
not
at
all
at
my
ease
regard
the
manner
in
which
I
should
acquit
myself
under
that
lady
's
roof
.
<EOS>
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
come
to
Miss
Havisham
's
house
,
which
be
of
old
brick
,
and
dismal
,
and
have
a
great
many
iron
bar
to
it
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
window
have
be
wall
up
;
of
those
that
remain
,
all
the
low
be
rustily
bar
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
court
-
yard
in
front
,
and
that
be
bar
;
so
,
we
have
to
wait
,
after
ring
the
bell
,
until
some
one
should
come
to
open
it
.
<EOS>
while
we
wait
at
the
gate
,
I
peep
in
(
even
then
Mr
Pumblechook
say
,
"
<EOS>
and
fourteen
?
"
<EOS>
but
I
pretend
not
to
hear
him
)
,
and
see
that
at
the
side
of
the
house
there
be
a
large
brewery
.
<EOS>
no
brewing
be
go
on
in
it
,
and
none
seem
to
have
go
on
for
a
long
long
time
.
  
<EOS>
a
window
be
raise
,
and
a
clear
voice
demand
"
what
name
?
"
<EOS>
to
which
my
conductor
reply
,
"
Pumblechook
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
voice
return
,
"
quite
right
,
"
and
the
window
be
shut
again
,
and
a
young
lady
come
across
the
court
-
yard
,
with
key
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
,
"
say
Mr
Pumblechook
,
"
be
Pip
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
Pip
,
be
it
?
"
return
the
young
lady
,
who
be
very
pretty
and
seem
very
proud
;
"
come
in
,
Pip
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
be
come
in
also
,
when
she
stop
him
with
the
gate
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
wish
to
see
Miss
Havisham
?
"
  
"
if
Miss
Havisham
wish
to
see
me
,
"
return
Mr
Pumblechook
discomfit
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
girl
;
"
but
you
see
she
do
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
say
it
so
finally
,
and
in
such
an
undiscussible
way
,
that
Mr
Pumblechook
,
though
in
a
condition
of
ruffle
dignity
,
could
not
protest
.
<EOS>
but
he
eye
me
severely
---
as
if
I
have
do
anything
to
him
!
<EOS>
---
and
depart
with
the
word
reproachfully
deliver
:
"
boy
!
<EOS>
let
your
behaviour
here
be
a
credit
unto
them
which
bring
you
up
by
hand
!
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
free
from
apprehension
that
he
would
come
back
to
propound
through
the
gate
,
"
and
sixteen
?
"
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
.
  
<EOS>
My
young
conductress
lock
the
gate
,
and
we
go
across
the
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
It
be
pave
and
clean
,
but
grass
be
grow
in
every
crevice
.
<EOS>
the
brewery
building
have
a
little
lane
of
communication
with
it
;
and
the
wooden
gate
of
that
lane
stand
open
,
and
all
the
brewery
beyond
,
stand
open
,
away
to
the
high
enclose
wall
;
and
all
be
empty
and
disuse
.
<EOS>
the
cold
wind
seem
to
blow
colder
there
,
than
outside
the
gate
;
and
it
make
a
shrill
noise
in
howl
in
and
out
at
the
open
side
of
the
brewery
,
like
the
noise
of
wind
in
the
rigging
of
a
ship
at
sea
.
<EOS>
myself
in
a
pretty
large
room
,
well
light
with
wax
candle
.
<EOS>
no
glimpse
of
daylight
be
to
be
see
in
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dressing
-
room
,
as
I
suppose
from
the
furniture
,
though
much
of
it
be
of
form
and
use
then
quite
unknown
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
prominent
in
it
be
a
drape
table
with
a
gilded
looking
-
glass
,
and
that
I
make
out
at
first
sight
to
be
a
fine
lady
's
dressing
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
whether
I
should
have
make
out
this
object
so
soon
,
if
there
have
be
no
fine
lady
sit
at
it
,
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
in
an
armchair
,
with
an
elbow
resting
on
the
table
and
her
head
lean
on
that
hand
,
sit
the
strange
lady
I
have
ever
see
,
or
shall
ever
see
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
dress
in
rich
material
---
satin
,
and
lace
,
and
silk
---
all
of
white
.
<EOS>
Her
shoe
be
white
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
a
long
white
veil
dependent
from
her
hair
,
and
she
have
bridal
flower
in
her
hair
,
but
her
hair
be
white
.
<EOS>
some
bright
jewel
sparkle
on
her
neck
and
on
her
hand
,
and
some
other
jewel
lie
sparkle
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
dress
,
less
splendid
than
the
dress
she
wear
,
and
half
-
pack
trunk
,
be
scatter
about
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
quite
finish
dress
for
she
have
<EOS>
but
one
shoe
on
---
the
other
be
on
the
table
near
her
hand
---
<EOS>
her
veil
be
but
half
arrange
,
her
watch
and
chain
be
not
put
on
,
and
some
lace
for
her
bosom
lie
with
those
trinket
,
and
with
her
handkerchief
,
and
glove
,
and
some
flower
,
and
a
prayer
-
book
,
all
confusedly
heap
about
the
looking
-
glass
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
the
first
few
moment
that
I
see
all
these
thing
,
though
I
see
more
of
them
in
the
first
moment
than
may
be
suppose
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
see
that
everything
within
my
view
which
ought
to
be
white
,
have
be
white
long
ago
,
and
have
lose
its
lustre
,
and
be
fade
and
yellow
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
the
bride
within
the
bridal
dress
have
wither
like
the
dress
,
and
like
the
flower
,
and
have
no
brightness
leave
but
the
brightness
of
her
sink
eye
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
the
dress
have
be
put
upon
the
rounded
figure
of
a
young
woman
,
and
that
the
figure
upon
which
it
now
hang
loose
,
have
shrink
to
skin
and
bone
.
<EOS>
once
,
I
have
be
take
to
see
some
ghastly
waxwork
at
the
Fair
,
represent
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
impossible
personage
lie
in
state
.
<EOS>
once
,
I
have
be
take
to
one
of
our
old
marsh
church
to
see
a
skeleton
in
the
ashe
of
a
rich
dress
,
that
have
be
dig
out
of
a
vault
under
the
church
pavement
.
<EOS>
now
,
waxwork
and
skeleton
seem
to
have
dark
eye
that
move
and
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
cry
out
,
if
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
it
?
"
say
the
lady
at
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pip
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pip
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pumblechook
's
boy
,
madam

<EOS>
come

to
play
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
nearer
;
let
me
look
at
you
.
<EOS>
come
close
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
when
I
stand
before
her
,
avoid
her
eye
,
that
I
take
note
of
the
surround
object
in
detail
,
and
see
that
her
watch
have
stop
at
twenty
minute
to
nine
,
and
that
a
clock
in
the
room
have
stop
at
twenty
minute
to
nine
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
at
me
,
"
say
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
afraid
of
a
woman
who
have
never
see
the
sun
since
you
be
bear
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
regret
to
state
that
I
be
not
afraid
of
tell
the
enormous
lie
comprehend
in
the
answer
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
what
I
touch
here
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
,
lay
her
hand
,
one
upon
the
other
,
on
her
left
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
(
It
make
me
think
of
the
young
man
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
touch
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Your
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
break
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
utter
the
word
with
an
eager
look
,
and
with
strong
emphasis
,
and
with
a
weird
smile
that
have
a
kind
of
boast
in
it
.
<EOS>
afterwards
,
she
keep
her
hand
there
for
a
little
while
,
and
slowly
take
them
away
as
if
they
be
heavy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
tired
,
"
say
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
diversion
,
and
I
have
do
with
man
and
woman
.
<EOS>
play
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
will
be
concede
by
my
most
disputatious
reader
,
that
she
could
hardly
have
direct
an
unfortunate
boy
to
do
anything
in
the
wide
world
more
difficult
to
be
do
under
the
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
sometimes
have
sick
fancy
,
"
she
go
on
,
"
and
I
have
a
sick
fancy
that
I
want
to
see
some
play
.
<EOS>
there
,
there
!
"
with
an
impatient
movement
of
the
finger
of
her
right
hand
;
"
play
,
play
,
play
!
"
  
<EOS>
for
a
moment
,
with
the
fear
of
my
sister
's
work
me
before
my
eye
,
I
have
a
desperate
idea
of
start
round
the
room
in
the
assumed
character
of
Mr
Pumblechook
's
chaise
-
cart
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
feel
myself
so
unequal
to
the
performance
that
I
give
it
up
,
and
stand
look
at
Miss
Havisham
in
what
I
suppose
she
take
for
a
dogged
manner
,
inasmuch
as
she
say
,
when
we
have
take
a
good
look
at
each
other
:
  
"
<EOS>
be
you
sullen
and
obstinate
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
madam
,
I
be
very
sorry
for
you
,
and
very
sorry
I
can
not
play
just
now
.
<EOS>
if
you
complain
of
me
I
shall
get
into
trouble
with
my
sister
,
so
I
would
do
it
if
I
could
;
but
it
be
so
new
here
,
and
so
strange
,
and
so
fine
---
and
melancholy
<EOS>
---
"
I
stop
,
fear
I
may
say
too
much
,
or
have
already
say
it
,
and
we
take
another
look
at
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
before
she
speak
again
,
she
turn
her
eye
from
me
,
and
look
at
the
dress
she
wear
,
and
at
the
dressing
-
table
,
and
finally
at
herself
in
the
looking
-
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
new
to
him
,
"
she
mutter
,
"
so
old
to
me
;
so
strange
to
him
,
so
familiar
to
me
;
so
melancholy
to
both
of
us
!
<EOS>
call
Estella
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
she
be
still
look
at
the
reflection
of
herself
,
I
think
she
be
still
talk
to
herself
,
and
keep
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Call
Estella
,
"
she
repeat
,
flash
a
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
do
that
.
<EOS>
call
Estella
.
<EOS>
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
stand
in
the
dark
in
a
mysterious
passage
of
an
unknown
house
,
bawl
Estella
to
a
scornful
young
lady
neither
visible
nor
responsive
,
and
feel
it
a
dreadful
liberty
so
to
roar
out
her
name
,
be
almost
as
bad
as
play
to
order
.
<EOS>
but
,
she
answer
at
last
,
and
her
light
come
along
the
dark
passage
like
a
star

<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
beckon
her
to
come
close
,
and
take
up
a
jewel
from
the
table
,
and
try
its
effect
upon
her
fair
young
bosom
and
against
her
pretty
brown
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
own
,
one
day
,
my
dear
,
and
you
will
use
it
well
.
<EOS>
let
me
see
you
play
card
with
this
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
with
this
boy
!
<EOS>
why
,
he
be
a
common
labouring
-
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
overhear
Miss
Havisham
answer
---
only
it
seem
so
unlikely
---
"
<EOS>
well
?
<EOS>
You
can
break
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
play
,
boy
?
"
ask
Estella
of
myself
,
with
the
great
disdain
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
but
beggar
my
neighbour
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
beggar
him
,
"
say
Miss
Havisham
to
Estella
.
<EOS>
so
we
sit
down
to
card
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
then
I
begin
to
understand
that
everything
in
the
room
have
stop
,
like
the
watch
and
the
clock
,
a
long
time
ago
.
<EOS>
I
notice
that
Miss
Havisham
put
down
the
jewel
exactly
on
the
spot
from
which
she
have
take
it
up
.
<EOS>
as
Estella
deal
the
card
,
I
glance
at
the
dressing
-
table
again
,
and
see
that
the
shoe
upon
it
,
once
white
,
now
yellow
,
have
never
be
wear
.
<EOS>
I
glance
down
at
the
foot
from
which
the
shoe
be
absent
,
and
see
that
the
silk
stock
on
it
,
once
white
,
now
yellow
,
have
be
tread
ragged
.
<EOS>
without
this
arrest
of
everything
,
this
standing
still
of
all
the
pale
decay
object
,
not
even
the
withered
bridal
dress
on
the
collapse
form
could
have
look
so
like
grave
-
clothe
,
or
the
long
veil
so
like
a
shroud
.
  
<EOS>
so
she
sit
,
corpse
-
like
,
as
we
play
at
card
;
the
frilling
and
trimming
on
her
bridal
dress
,
look
like
earthy
paper
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
then
,
of
the
discovery
that
be
occasionally
make
of
body
bury
in
ancient
time
,
which
fall
to
powder
in
the
moment
of
be
distinctly
see
;
but
,
I
have
often
think
since
,
that
she
must
have
look
as
if
the
admission
of
the
natural
light
of
day
would
have
strike
her
to
dust
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
call
the
knave
,
Jacks
,
this
boy
!
"
say
Estella
with
disdain
,
before
our
first
game
be
out
.
"
<EOS>
and
what
coarse
hand
he
have
!
<EOS>
and
what
thick
boot
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
never
think
of
be
ashamed
of
my
hand
before
;
but
I
begin
to
consider
them
a
very
indifferent
pair
.
<EOS>
Her
contempt
for
me
be
so
strong
,
that
it
become
infectious
,
and
I
catch
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
win
the
game
,
and
I
deal
.
<EOS>
I
misdealt
,
as
be
only
natural
,
when
I
know
she
be
lie
in
wait
for
me
to
do
wrong
;
and
she
denounce
me
for
a
stupid
,
clumsy
labouring
-
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
nothing
of
her
,
"
remark
Miss
Havisham
to
me
,
as
she
look
on
.
"
<EOS>
She
say
many
hard
thing
of
you
,
but
you
say
nothing
of
her
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
to
say
,
"
I
stammer
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
in
my
ear
,
"
say
Miss
Havisham
,
bend
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
be
very
proud
,
"
I
reply
,
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
anything
else
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
be
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
anything
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
be
very
insulting
.
"
<EOS>
(
She
be
look
at
me
then
with
a
look
of
supreme
aversion
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
anything
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
should
like
to
go
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
never
see
her
again
,
though
she
be
so
pretty
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
sure
that
I
should
not
like
to
see
her
again
,
but
I
should
like
to
go
home
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
go
soon
,
"
say
Miss
Havisham
,
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
play
the
game
,
out
.
  
<EOS>
save
for
the
one
weird
smile
at
first
,
I
should
have
feel
almost
sure
that
Miss
Havisham
's
face
could
not
smile
.
<EOS>
It
have
drop
into
a
watchful
and
brood
expression
---
most
likely
when
all
the
thing
about
her
have
become
transfixed
---
and
it
look
as
if
nothing
could
ever
lift
it
up
again
.
<EOS>
Her
chest
have
drop
,
so
that
she
stoop
;
and
her
voice
have
drop
,
so
that
she
speak
low
,
and
with
a
dead
lull
upon
her
;
altogether
,
she
have
the
appearance
of
have
drop
,
body
and
soul
,
within
and
without
,
under
the
weight
of
a
crush
blow
.
  
<EOS>
I
play
the
game
to
an
end
with
Estella
,
and
she
beggar
me
.
<EOS>
She
throw
the
card
down
on
the
table
when
she
have
win
them
all
,
as
if
she
despise
them
for
have
be
win
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
shall
I
have
you
here
again
?
"
say
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
begin
to
remind
her
that
to
-
day
be
Wednesday
,
when
she
check
me
with
her
former
impatient
movement
of
the
finger
of
her
right
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
there
!
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
day
of
the
week
;
I
know
nothing
of
week
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
come
again
after
six
day
.
<EOS>
You
hear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Estella
,
take
him
down
.
<EOS>
let
him
have
something
to
eat
,
and
let
him
roam
and
look
about
him
while
he
eat
.
<EOS>
go
,
Pip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
follow
the
candle
down
,
as
I
have
follow
the
candle
up
,
and
she
stand
it
in
the
place
where
we
have
find
it
.
<EOS>
until
she
open
the
side
entrance
,
I
have
fancy
,
without
think
about
it
,
that
it
must
necessarily
be
night
-
time
.
<EOS>
the
rush
of
the
daylight
quite
confound
me
,
and
make
me
feel
as
if
I
have
be
in
the
candlelight
of
the
strange
room
many
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
to
wait
here
,
you
boy
,
"
say
Estella
;
and
disappear
and
close
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
the
opportunity
of
be
alone
in
the
court
-
yard
,
to
look
at
my
coarse
hand
and
my
common
boot
.
<EOS>
My
opinion
of
those
accessory
be
not
favourable
.
<EOS>
They
have
never
trouble
me
before
,
but
they
trouble
me
now
,
as
vulgar
appendage
.
<EOS>
I
determine
to
ask
Joe
why
he
have
ever
teach
me
to
call
those
picture
-
card
,
Jacks
,
which
ought
to
be
call
knave
.
<EOS>
I
wish
Joe
have
be
rather
more
genteelly
bring
up
,
and
then
I
should
have
be
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
She
come
back
,
with
some
bread
and
meat
and
a
little
mug
of
beer
.
<EOS>
She
put
the
mug
down
on
the
stone
of
the
yard
,
and
give
me
the
bread
and
meat
without
look
at
me
,
as
insolently
as
if
I
be
a
dog
in
disgrace
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
humiliate
,
hurt
,
spurn
,
offend
,
angry
,
sorry
---
<EOS>
I
can
not
hit
upon
the
right
name
for
the
smart
<EOS>
---
God
know
what
its
name
be
---
that
tear
start
to
my
eye
.
<EOS>
the
moment
they
spring
there
,
the
girl
look
at
me
with
a
quick
delight
in
have
be
the
cause
of
them
.
<EOS>
this
give
me
power
to
keep
them
back
and
to
look
at
her
:
<EOS>
so
,
she
give
a
contemptuous
toss
---
<EOS>
but
with
a
sense
,
I
think
,
of
have
make
too
sure
that
I
be
so
wounded
---
and
leave
me
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
when
she
be
go
,
I
look
about
me
for
a
place
to
hide
my
face
in
,
and
get
behind
one
of
the
gate
in
the
brewery
-
lane
,
and
lean
my
sleeve
against
the
wall
there
,
and
lean
my
forehead
on
it
and
cry
.
<EOS>
as
I
cry
,
I
kick
the
wall
,
and
take
a
hard
twist
at
my
hair
;
so
bitter
be
my
feeling
,
and
so
sharp
be
the
smart
without
a
name
,
that
need
counteraction
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
's
bringing
up
have
make
me
sensitive
.
<EOS>
in
the
little
world
in
which
child
have
their
existence
whosoever
bring
them
up
,
there
be
nothing
so
finely
perceive
and
so
finely
feel
,
as
injustice
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
only
small
injustice
that
the
child
can
be
expose
to
;
but
the
child
be
small
,
and
its
world
be
small
,
and
its
rock
-
horse
stand
as
many
hand
high
,
accord
to
scale
,
as
a
big
-
bone
irish
hunter
.
<EOS>
within
myself
,
I
have
sustain
,
from
my
babyhood
,
a
perpetual
conflict
with
injustice
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
,
from
the
time
when
I
could
speak
,
that
my
sister
,
in
her
capricious
and
violent
coercion
,
be
unjust
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
cherish
a
profound
conviction
that
her
bring
me
up
by
hand
,
give
her
no
right
to
bring
me
up
by
jerk
.
<EOS>
through
all
my
punishment
,
disgrace
,
fast
and
vigil
,
and
other
penitential
performance
,
I
have
nurse
this
assurance
;
and
to
my
communing
so
much
with
it
,
in
a
solitary
and
unprotected
way
,
I
in
great
part
refer
the
fact
that
I
be
morally
timid
and
very
sensitive
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
rid
of
my
injure
feeling
for
the
time
,
by
kick
them
into
the
brewery
wall
,
and
twist
them
out
of
my
hair
,
and
then
I
smooth
my
face
with
my
sleeve
,
and
come
from
behind
the
gate
.
<EOS>
the
bread
and
meat
be
acceptable
,
and
the
beer
be
warm
and
tingle
,
and
I
be
soon
in
spirit
to
look
about
me
.
  
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
it
be
a
deserted
place
,
down
to
the
pigeon
-
house
in
the
brewery
-
yard
,
which
have
be
blow
crooked
on
its
pole
by
some
high
wind
,
and
would
have
make
the
pigeon
think
themselves
at
sea
,
if
there
have
be
any
pigeon
there
to
be
rock
by
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
there
be
no
pigeon
in
the
dove
-
cot
,
no
horse
in
the
stable
,
<EOS>
no
pig
in
the
sty
,
no
malt
in
the
store
-
house
,
no
smell
of
grain
and
beer
in
the
copper
or
the
vat
.
<EOS>
all
the
use
and
scent
of
the
brewery
may
have
evaporate
with
its
last
reek
of
smoke
.
<EOS>
in
a
by
-
yard
,
there
be
a
wilderness
of
empty
cask
,
which
have
a
certain
sour
remembrance
of
well
day
linger
about
them
;
but
it
be
too
sour
to
be
accept
as
a
sample
of
the
beer
that
be
go
---
and
in
this
respect
I
remember
those
recluse
as
be
like
most
other
.
  
<EOS>
behind
the
furth
end
of
the
brewery
,
be
a
rank
garden
with
an
old
wall
:
not
so
high
but
that
I
could
struggle
up
and
hold
on
long
enough
to
look
over
it
,
and
see
that
the
rank
garden
be
the
garden
of
the
house
,
and
that
it
be
overgrow
with
tangle
weed
,
but
that
there
be
a
track
upon
the
green
and
yellow
path
,
as
if
some
one
sometimes
walk
there
,
and
that
Estella
be
walk
away
from
me
even
then
.
<EOS>
but
she
seem
to
be
everywhere
.
<EOS>
for
,
when
I
yield
to
the
temptation
present
by
the
cask
,
and
begin
to
walk
on
them
,
I
see
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
her
<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
walk
on
them
at
the
end
of
the
yard
of
cask
.
<EOS>
She
have
her
back
towards
me
,
and
hold
her
pretty
brown
hair
spread
out
in
her
two
hand
,
and
never
look
round
,
and
pass
out
of
my
view
directly
.
<EOS>
so
,
in
the
brewery
itself---
by
which
I
mean
the
large
pave
lofty
place
in
which
they
use
to
make
the
beer
,
and
where
the
brewing
utensil
still
be
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
go
into
it
,
and
,
rather
oppress
by
its
gloom
,
stand
near
the
door
look
about
me
,
I
see
her
pass
among
the
extinguish
fire
,
and
ascend
some
light
iron
stair
,
and
go
out
by
a
gallery
high
overhead
,
as
if
she
be
go
out
into
the
sky
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
place
,
and
at
this
moment
,
that
a
strange
thing
happen
to
my
fancy
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
a
strange
thing
then
,
and
I
think
it
a
strange
thing
long
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
turn
my
eye
---
a
little
dimmed
by
look
up
at
the
frosty
light
---
towards
a
great
wooden
beam
in
a
low
nook
of
the
building
near
me
on
my
right
hand
,
and
I
see
a
figure
hang
there
by
the
neck
.
<EOS>
a
figure
all
in
yellow
white
,
with
but
one
shoe
to
the
foot
;
and
it
hang
so
,
that
I
could
see
that
the
fade
trimming
of
the
dress
be
like
earthy
paper
,
and
that
the
face
be
Miss
Havisham
's
,
with
a
movement
go
over
the
whole
countenance
as
if
she
be
try
to
call
to
me
.
<EOS>
in
the
terror
of
see
the
figure
,
and
in
the
terror
of
be
certain
that
it
have
not
be
there
a
moment
before
,
I
at
first
run
from
it
,
and
then
run
towards
it
.
<EOS>
and
my
terror
be
great
of
all
,
when
I
find
no
figure
there
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
less
than
the
frosty
light
of
the
cheerful
sky
,
the
sight
of
people
pass
beyond
the
bar
of
the
court
-
yard
gate
,
and
the
reviving
influence
of
the
rest
of
the
bread
and
meat
and
beer
,
would
have
bring
me
round
.
<EOS>
even
with
those
aid
,
I
may
not
have
come
to
myself
as
soon
as
I
do
,
but
that
I
see
Estella
approach
with
the
key
,
to
let
me
out
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
some
fair
reason
for
look
down
upon
me
,
I
think
,
if
she
see
me
frightened
;
and
she
should
have
no
fair
reason
.
  
<EOS>
She
give
me
a
triumphant
glance
in
pass
me
,
as
if
she
rejoice
that
my
hand
be
so
coarse
and
my
boot
be
so
thick
,
and
she
open
the
gate
,
and
stand
hold
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
pass
out
without
look
at
her
,
when
she
touch
me
with
a
taunt
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
cry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
do
not
want
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
cry
till
you
be
half
blind
,
and
you
be
near
cry
again
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
laugh
contemptuously
,
push
me
out
,
and
lock
the
gate
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
go
straight
to
Mr
Pumblechook
's
,
and
be
immensely
relieved
to
find
him
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
so
,
leave
word
with
the
shopman
on
what
day
I
be
want
at
Miss
Havisham
be
again
,
I
set
off
on
the
four
-
mile
walk
to
our
forge
;
ponder
,
as
I
go
along
,
on
all
I
have
see
,
and
deeply
revolving
that
I
be
a
common
labouring
-
boy
;
that
my
hand
be
coarse
;
that
my
boot
be
thick
;
that
I
have
fall
into
a
despicable
habit
of
call
knave
Jacks
;
that
I
be
much
more
ignorant
than
I
have
consider
myself
last
night
,
and
generally
that
I
be
in
a
low
-
live
bad
way
.

chapter
09
 
<EOS>
when
I
reach
home
,
my
sister
be
very
curious
to
know
all
about
Miss
Havisham
's
,
and
ask
a
number
of
question
.
<EOS>
and
I
soon
find
myself
get
heavily
bump
from
behind
in
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
the
small
of
the
back
,
and
have
my
face
ignominiously
shove
against
the
kitchen
wall
,
because
I
do
not
answer
those
question
at
sufficient
length
.
  
<EOS>
if
a
dread
of
not
be
understand
be
hide
in
the
breast
of
other
young
people
to
anything
like
the
extent
to
which
it
use
to
be
hide
in
mine
---
which
I
consider
probable
,
as
I
have
no
particular
reason
to
suspect
myself
of
have
be
a
monstrosity
---
it
be
the
key
to
many
reservation
.
<EOS>
I
feel
convinced
that
if
I
describe
Miss
Havisham
's
as
my
eye
have
see
it
,
I
should
not
be
understand
.
 
<EOS>
not
only
that
,
but
<EOS>
I
feel
convinced
that
Miss
Havisham
too
would
not
be
understand
;
and
although
she
be
perfectly
incomprehensible
to
me
,
I
entertain
an
impression
that
there
would
be
something
coarse
and
treacherous
in
my
drag
her
as
she
really
be
(
to
say
nothing
of
Miss
Estella
)
before
the
contemplation
of
Mrs.
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
,
I
say
as
little
as
I
could
,
and
have
my
face
shove
against
the
kitchen
wall
.
  
<EOS>
the
bad
of
it
be
that
that
bully
old
Pumblechook
,
prey
upon
by
a
devour
curiosity
to
be
inform
of
all
I
have
see
and
hear
,
come
gape
over
in
his
chaise
-
cart
at
tea
-
time
,
to
have
the
detail
divulge
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
mere
sight
of
the
torment
,
with
his
fishy
eye
and
mouth
open
,
his
sandy
hair
inquisitively
on
end
,
and
his
waistcoat
heave
with
windy
arithmetic
,
make
me
vicious
in
my
reticence
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
boy
,
"
Uncle
Pumblechook
begin
,
as
soon
as
he
be
seat
in
the
chair
of
honour
by
the
fire
.
"
<EOS>
how
do
you
get
on
up
town
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
pretty
well
,
sir
,
"
and
my
sister
shake
her
fist
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
pretty
well
?
"
Mr.
Pumblechook
repeat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
pretty
well
be
no
answer
.
<EOS>
tell
us
what
you
mean
by
pretty
well
,
boy
?
"
  
<EOS>
whitewash
on
the
forehead
harden
the
brain
into
a
state
of
obstinacy
perhaps
.
<EOS>
anyhow
,
with
whitewash
from
the
wall
on
my
forehead
,
my
obstinacy
be
adamantine
.
<EOS>
I
reflect
for
some
time
,
and
then
answer
as
if
I
have
discover
a
new
idea
,
"
I
mean
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
sister
with
an
exclamation
of
impatience
be
go
to
fly
at
me
---
I
have
no
shadow
of
defence
,
for
Joe
be
busy
in
the
forge
---
when
Mr
Pumblechook
interpose
with
"
no
!
<EOS>
do
not
lose
your
temper
.
<EOS>
leave
this
lad
to
me
,
madam
;
leave
this
lad
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
then
turn
me
towards
him
,
as
if
he
be
go
to
cut
my
hair
,
and
say
:
  
"
<EOS>
first
(
to
get
our
thought
in
order
)
:
forty
-
three
penny
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
calculate
the
consequence
of
reply
"
four
Hundred
Pound
,
"
and
find
them
against
me
,
go
as
near
the
answer
as
I
could
---
which
be
somewhere
about
eightpence
off
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
then
put
me
through
my
pence
-
table
from
"
twelve
penny
make
one
shilling
,
"
up
to
"
forty
penny
<EOS>
make
three
and
fourpence
,
"
and
then
triumphantly
demand
,
as
if
he
have
do
for
me
,
"
\
now
!
<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
how
much
be
forty
-
three
penny
?
"
<EOS>
to
which
I
reply
,
after
a
long
interval
of
reflection
,
"
I
do
not
know
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
be
so
aggravate
that
I
almost
doubt
if
I
do
know
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
work
his
head
like
a
screw
to
screw
it
out
of
me
,
and
say
,
"
be
forty
-
three
pence
seven
and
sixpence
three
farden
,
for
instance
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
!
"
say
I.
<EOS>
and
although
my
sister
instantly
box
my
ear
,
it
be
highly
gratify
to
me
to
see
that
the
answer
spoil
his
joke
,
and
bring
him
to
a
dead
stop
.
  
<EOS>
"
boy
!
<EOS>
what
like
be
Miss
Havisham
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
begin
again
when
he
have
recover
;
fold
his
arm
tight
on
his
chest
and
apply
the
screw
.
  
<EOS>
"

I
tell

<EOS>
"

ask
my

<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
wink
assent
;
from
which
I
at
once
infer
that
he
have
never
see
Miss
Havisham
,
for
she
be
nothing
of
the
kind
.
  
<EOS>
"
good

say
Mr

conceitedly
.
<EOS>
(

She

I
answer
,
"
in

<EOS>
Mr

stare
at

and
both
repeat

<EOS>
Mr

stare
at

again
,
in
utter
amazement

<EOS>
I
be
perfectly
frantic

They
stare
again

there
be

I
add
this
saving
clause

moment
of
reject

<EOS>
"
We

(
I

to

all
over

out

"
out

I.

and
I
see
pistol
in

and
jam

and
pill

<EOS>
and
there
be
no
daylight
in

"
  
<EOS>

Mr

with
a
grave
nod

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
be
the
state
of
the
case

for
that
much
I
have
see
myself
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
they
both
stare
at
me
,
and
I
,
with
an
obtrusive
show
of
artlessness
on
my
countenance
,
stare
at
them
,
and
plait
the
right
leg
of
my
trouser
with
my
right
hand
.
  
<EOS>
if
they
have
ask
me
any
more
question
I
should
undoubtedly
have
betray
myself
,
for
I
be
even
then
on
the
point
of
mention
that
there
be
a
balloon
in
the
yard
,
and
should
have
hazard
the
statement
but
for
my
invention
be
divide
between
that
phenomenon
and
a
bear
in
the
brewery
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
much
occupy
,
however
,
in
discuss
the
marvel
I
have
already
present
for
their
consideration
,
that
I
escape
.
<EOS>
the
subject
still
hold
them
when
Joe
come
in
from
his
work
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
.
<EOS>
to
whom
my
sister
,
more
for
the
relief
of
her
own
mind
than
for
the
gratification
of
his
,
related
my
pretended
experience
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
when
I
see
Joe
open
his
blue
eye
and
roll
them
all
round
the
kitchen
in
helpless
amazement
<EOS>
,
I
be
overtake
by
penitence
;
but
only
as
regard
him
---
not
in
the
least
as
regard
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
towards
Joe
,
and
Joe
only
,
I
consider
myself
a
young
monster
,
while
they
sit
debate
what
result
would
come
to
me
from
Miss
Havisham
's
acquaintance
and
favour
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
doubt
that
Miss
Havisham
would
"
do
something
"
for
me
;
their
doubt
relate
to
the
form
that
something
would
take
.
<EOS>
My
sister
stand
out
for
"
property

"
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
be
in
favour
of
a
handsome
premium
for
bind
me
apprentice
to
some
genteel
trade
---
say
,
the
corn
and
seed
trade
,
for
instance
.
<EOS>
Joe
fall
into
the
deep
disgrace
with
both
,
for
offer
the
bright
suggestion
that
I
may
only
be
present
with
one
of
the
dog
who
have
fight
for
the
veal
-
cutlet
.
<EOS>
"
if
a
fool
's
head
can
not
express
well
opinion
than
that
,
"
say
my
sister

"
and
you

any

<EOS>
so
he
go

<EOS>
after
Mr

have
drive
off
,
and
when
my

be
wash
up

I
steal
into
the
forge
to
Joe
,
and
remain
by
him
until
he
have
do
for

night

then
I

back
in
the
great
amazement

<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
to

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
I
do
;
it
be
lie
,
Joe
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
not
all
of
it
?
<EOS>
why
sure
you
do
not
mean
to
say
,
Pip
,
that
there
be
no
black
welwet
<EOS>
co
---
eh
?
"
for
,
I
stand
shake
my
head
.
"
<EOS>
but
at
least
there
be
dog
,
Pip
?
<EOS>
come
,
Pip
,
"
say
Joe
,
persuasively
,
"
if
there
warn't
<EOS>
no
weal
-
cutlet
,
at
least
there
be
dog
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

Joe

"
  
<EOS>
"

a

Joe

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
puppy
?
<EOS>
come
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Joe
,
there
be
nothing
at
all
of
the
kind
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
I
fix
my
eye
hopelessly
on
Joe
,
Joe
contemplate
me
in
dismay
.
<EOS>
"
Pip
,
old
chap
!
<EOS>
this
will
not
do
,
old
fellow
!
<EOS>
I
say
!
<EOS>
where
do
you
expect
to
go
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
terrible
,
Joe
;
an't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
terrible
?
"
cry
Joe
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
awful
!
<EOS>
what
possess
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
possess
me
,
Joe
,
"
I
reply
,
let
his
shirt
sleeve
go
,
and
sit
down
in
the
ashe
at
his
foot
,
hang
my
head
;
"
but
I
wish
you
have
not
teach
me
to
call
Knaves
at
card
,
Jacks
;
and
I
wish
my
boot
be
not
so
thick
nor
my
hand
so
coarse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
I
tell
Joe
that
I
feel
very
miserable
,
and
that
I
have
not
be
able
to
explain
myself
to
Mrs
Joe
and
Pumblechook
who
be
so
rude
to
me
,
and
that
there
have
be
a
beautiful
young
lady
at
Miss
Havisham
's
who
be
dreadfully
proud
,
and
that
she
have
say
I
be
common
,
and
that
I
know
I
be
common
,
and
that
I
wish
I
be
not
common
,
and
that
the
lie
have
come
of
it
somehow
,
though
I
do
not
know
how
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
case
of
metaphysic
,
at
least
as
difficult
for
Joe
to
deal
with
,
as
for
me
.
<EOS>
but
Joe
take
the
case
altogether
out
of
the
region
of
metaphysic
,
and
by
that
mean
vanquish
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
one
thing
you
may
be
sure
of
,
Pip
,
"
say
Joe
,
after
some
rumination
,
"
namely
,
that
lie
be
lie
.
<EOS>
howsever
<EOS>
they
come
,
they
do
not
ought
to
come
,
and
they
come
from
the
father
of
lie
,
and
work
round
to
the
same
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
tell
no
more
of
'em
,
Pip
.
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
that
\
 
be
not
the
way
to
get
out

old
chap

<EOS>
and
as
to
be
common
,
I
do
not
make
it
out

You

Joe

there
be

in

"
  
<EOS>
when
I
get
up
to
my
little
room
and
say
my
prayer
,
I
do
not
forget
Joe
's
recommendation
,
and
yet
my
young
mind
be
in
that
disturbed
and
unthankful
state
,
<EOS>
that
I
think
long
after
I
lay
me
down
,
how
common
Estella
would
consider
Joe
,
a
mere
blacksmith
:
how
thick
his
boot
,
and
how
coarse
his
hand
.
<EOS>
I
think
how
Joe
and
my
sister
be
then
sit
in
the
kitchen
,
and
how
I
have
come
up
to
bed
from
the
kitchen
,
and
how
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
never
sit
in
a
kitchen
,
but
be
far
above
the
level
of
such
common
doing
.
<EOS>
I
fall
asleep
recall
what
I
"
use
to
do
"
<EOS>
when
I
be
at
Miss
Havisham
's
;
as
though
I
have
be
there
week
or
month
,
instead
of
hour
;
and
as
though
it
be
quite
an
old
subject
of
remembrance
,
instead
of
one
that
have
arise
only
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
a
memorable
day
to
me
,
for
it
make
great
change
in
me
.
<EOS>
but
,
it
be
the
same
with
any
life
.
<EOS>
imagine
one
select
day
strike
out
of
it
,
and
think
how
different
its
course
would
have
be
.
<EOS>
pause
you
who
read
this
,
and
think
for
a
moment
of
the
long
chain
of
iron
or
gold
,
of
thorn
or
flower
,
that
would
never
have
bind
you
,
but
for
the
formation
of
the
first
link
on
one
memorable
day

<EOS>
Chapter
10
 
<EOS>
the
felicitous
idea
occur
to
me
a
morning
or
two
later
when
I
wake
,
that
the
good
step
I
could
take
towards
make
myself
uncommon
be
to
get
out
of
Biddy
everything
she
know
.
<EOS>
in
pursuance
of
this
luminous
conception
I
mention
to
Biddy
when
I
go
to
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
's
at
night
,
that
I
have
a
particular
reason
for
wish
to
get
on
in
life
,
and
that
I
should
feel
very
much
oblige
to
her
if
she
would
impart
all
her
learning
to
me
.
<EOS>
Biddy
,
who
be
the
most
obliging
of
girl
,
immediately
say
she
would
,
and
indeed
begin
to
carry
out
her
promise
within
five
minute
.
  
<EOS>
the
educational
scheme
or
course
establish
by
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
may
be
resolve
into
the
follow
synopsis
.
<EOS>
the
pupil
eat
apple
and
put
straw
down
one
another
's
back
,
until
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
collect
her
energy
,
and
make
an
indiscriminate
totter
at
them
with
a
birch
-
rod
.
<EOS>
after
receive
the
charge
with
every
mark
of
derision
,
the
pupil
form
in
line
and
buzzingly
pass
a
ragged
book
from
hand
to
hand
.
<EOS>
the
book
have
an
alphabet
in
it
,
some
figure
and
table
,
and
a
little
spelling---
that
be
to
say
,
it
have
have
once
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
this
volume
begin
to
circulate
,
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
fall
into
a
state
of
coma
;
arise
either
from
sleep
or
a
rheumatic
paroxysm
.
<EOS>
the
pupil
then
enter
among
themselves
upon
a
competitive
examination
on
the
subject
of
boot
,
with
the
view
of
ascertain
who
could
tread
the
hard
upon
whose
toe
.
<EOS>
this
mental
exercise
last
until
Biddy
make
a
rush
at
them
and
distribute
three
deface
Bibles
(
shape
as
if
they
have
be
unskilfully
cut
off
the
chump
-
end
of
something
)
,
more
illegibly
print
at
the
good
than
any
curiosity
of
literature
I
have
since
meet
with
,
speckle
all
over
with
iron
-
mould
,
and
have
various
specimen
of
the
insect
world
smash
between
their
leave
.
<EOS>
this
part
of
the
course
be
usually
lighten
by
several
single
combat
between
Biddy
and
refractory
student
.
<EOS>
when
the
fight
be
over
,
Biddy
give
out
the
number
of
a
page
,
and
then
we
all
read
aloud
what
we
could
---
or
what
we
could
not
---
in
a
frightful
chorus
;
Biddy
lead
with
a
high
shrill
monotonous
voice
,
and
none
of
us
have
the
least
notion
of
,
or
reverence
for
,
what
we
be
read
about
.
<EOS>
when
this
horrible
din
have
last
a
certain
time
,
it
mechanically
awake
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
,
who
stagger
at
a
boy
fortuitously
,
and
pull
his
ear
.
<EOS>
this
be
understand
to
terminate
the
course
for
the
evening
,
and
we
emerge
into
the
air
with
shriek
of
intellectual
victory
.
<EOS>
It
be
fair
to
remark
that
there
be
no
prohibition
against
any
pupil
's
entertain
himself
with
a
slate
or
even
with
the
ink
(
when
there
be
any
)
,
but
that
it
be
not
easy
to
pursue
that
branch
of
study
in
the
winter
season
,
on
account
of
the
little
general
shop
in
which
the
class
be
holden
---
and
which
be
also
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
's
sitting
-
room
and
bed
-
chamber
---
be
but
faintly
illuminate
through
the
agency
of
one
low
-
spirited
dip
-
candle
and
no
snuffer
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
that
it
would
take
time
,
to
become
uncommon
under
these
circumstance
:
nevertheless
,
I
resolve
to
try
it
,
and
that
very
evening
Biddy
enter
on
our
special
agreement
,
by
impart
some
information
from
her
little
catalogue
of
price
,
under
the
head
of
moist
sugar
,
and
lend
me
,
to
copy
at
home
,
a
large
old
English
d
which
she
have
imitate
from
the
heading
of
some
newspaper
,
and
which
I
suppose
,
until
she
tell
me
what
it
be
,
to
be
a
design
for
a
buckle
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
there
be
a
public
-
house
in
the
village
,
and
of
course
Joe
like
sometimes
to
smoke
his
pipe
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
receive
strict
order
from
my
sister
to
call
for
him
at
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
,
that
evening
,
on
my
way
from
school
,
and
bring
him
home
at
my
peril
.
<EOS>
to
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
,
therefore
,
I
direct
my
step
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
bar
at
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
with
some
alarmingly
long
chalk
score
in
it
on
the
wall
at
the
side
of
the
door
,
which
seem
to
me
to
be
never
pay
off
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
there
ever
since
I
could
remember
,
and
have
grow
more
than
I
have
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
quantity
of
chalk
about
our
country
,
and
perhaps
the
people
neglect
no
opportunity
of
turn
it
to
account
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
Saturday
night
,
I
find
the
landlord
look
rather
grimly
at
these
record
,
but
as
my
business
be
with
Joe
and
not
with
him
,
I
merely
wish
him
good
evening
,
and
pass
into
the
common
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
,
where
there
be
a
bright
large
kitchen
fire
,
and
where
Joe
be
smoke
his
pipe
in
company
with
Mr
Wopsle
and
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
Joe
greet
me
as
usual
with
"
Halloa
,
Pip
,
old
chap
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
moment
he
say
that
,
the
stranger
turn
his
head
and
look
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
secret
-
looking
man
whom
I
have
never
see
before
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
all
on
one
side
,
and
one
of
his
eye
be
half
shut
up
,
as
if
he
be
take
aim
at
something
with
an
invisible
gun
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
he
take
it
out
,
and
,
after
slowly
blow
all
his
smoke
away
and
look
hard
at
me
all
the
time
,
nod
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
nod
,
and
then
he
nod
again
,
and
make
room
on
the
settle
beside
him
that
I
may
sit
down
there
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
be
use
to
sit
beside
Joe
whenever
I
enter
that
place
of
resort
,
I
say
"
no
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
and
fall
into
the
space
Joe
make
for
me
on
the
opposite
settle
.
<EOS>
the
strange
man
,
after
glance
at
Joe
,
and
see
that
his
attention
be
otherwise
engage
,
nod
to
me
again
when
I
have
take
my
seat
,
and
then
rub
his
leg
---
in
a
very
odd
way
,
as
it
strike
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
say
,
"
say
the
strange
man
,

meditatively

not

of

that
it
could
be

necessary
to
consider
about

because
it
be
the
way
at

Jolly

seem
to
consider
deeply
about
everything

discuss
over
pipe

ask
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
which
appear
to
me
to
be
an
inquiry
of
unnecessary
strength
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
strike
in
upon
that
;
as
one
who
know
all
about
relationship
,
have
professional
occasion
to
bear
in
mind
<EOS>
what
female
relation
a
man
may
not
marry
;
and
expound
the
tie
between
me
and
Joe
.
<EOS>
have
his
hand
in
,
Mr
Wopsle
finish
off
with
a
most
terrifically
snarl
passage
from
Richard
the
Third
,
and
seem
to
think
he
have
do
quite
enough
to
account
for
it
when
he
add
,
---
"
as
the
poet
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
may
remark
that
when
Mr
Wopsle
refer
to
me
,
he
consider
it
a
necessary
part
of
such
reference
to
rumple
my
hair
and
poke
it
into
my
eye
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
why
everybody
of
his
standing
who
visit
at
our
house
should
always
have
put
me
through
the
same
inflammatory
process
under
similar
circumstance
.
<EOS>
yet
I
do
not
call
to
mind
that
I
be
ever
in
my
early
youth
the
subject
of
remark
in
our
social
family
circle
,
but
some
large
-
handed
person
take
some
such
ophthalmic
step
to
patronize
me
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
while
,
the
strange
man
look
at
nobody
but
me
,
and
look
at
me
as
if
he
be
determined
to
have
a
shot
at
me
at
last
,
and
bring
me
down
.
<EOS>
but
he
say
nothing
after
offer
his
Blue
Blazes
observation
,
until
the
glass
of
rum
-
and
-
water
be
bring
;
and
then
he
make
his
shot
,
and
a
most
extraordinary
shot
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
verbal
remark
,
but
a
proceeding
in
dumb
show
,
and
be
pointedly
address
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
stir
his
rum
-
and
-
water
pointedly
at
me
,
and
he
taste
his
rum
-
and
-
water
pointedly
at
me
.
<EOS>
and
he
stir
it
and
he
taste
it
:
not
with
a
spoon
that
be
bring
to
him
,
but
 
\
with
a
file
.
<EOS>
\
   
<EOS>
He
do
this
so
that
nobody
but
I
see
the
file
;
and
when
he
have
do
it
he
wipe
the
file
and
put
it
in
a
breast
-
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
to
be
Joe
's
file
,
and
I
know
that
he
know
my
convict
,
the
moment
I
see
the
instrument
.
<EOS>
I
sit
gaze
at
him
,
spell
-
bind
.
<EOS>
but
he
now
recline
on
his
settle
,
take
very
little
notice
of
me
,
and
talk
principally
about
turnip
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
delicious
sense
of
cleaning
-
up
and
make
a
quiet
pause
before
go
on
in
life
afresh
,
in
our
village
on
Saturday
night
,
which
stimulate
Joe
to
dare
to
stay
out
half
an
hour
longer
on
Saturdays
than
at
other
time
.
<EOS>
the
half
hour
and
the
rum
-
and
-
water
run
out
together
,
Joe
get
up
to
go
,
and
take
me
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
stop
half
a
moment
,
Mr
Gargery
,
"
say
the
strange
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
get
a
bright
new
shilling
somewhere
in
my
pocket
,
and
if
I
have
,
the
boy
shall
have
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
it
out
from
a
handful
of
small
change
,
fold
it
in
some
crumple
paper
,
and
give
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yours
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
mind
!
<EOS>
Your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thank
him
,
stare
at
him
far
beyond
the
bound
of
good
manner
,
and
hold
tight
to
Joe
.
<EOS>
He
give
Joe
good
-
night
,
and
he
give
Mr
Wopsle
good
-
night
(
who
go
out
with
us
)
,
and
he
give
me
only
a
look
with
his
aim
eye
---
<EOS>
no
,
not
a
look
,
for
he
shut
it
up
,
but
wonder
may
be
do
with
an
eye
by
hide
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
way
home
,
if
I
have
be
in
a
humour
for
talk
,
the
talk
must
have
be
all
on
my
side
,
for
Mr
Wopsle
part
from
us
at
the
door
of
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
and
Joe
go
all
the
way
home
with
his
mouth
wide
open
,
to
rinse
the
rum
out
with
as
much
air
as
possible
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
in
a
manner
stupefy
by
this
turning
up
of
my
old
misdeed
and
old
acquaintance
,
and
could
think
of
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
be
not
in
a
very
bad
temper
when
we
present
ourselves
in
the
kitchen
,
and
Joe
be
encourage
by
that
unusual
circumstance
to
tell
her
about
the
bright
shilling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
bad
un
,
I
will
be
bind
,
"
say
Mrs
Joe
triumphantly
,
"
or
he
would
not
have
give
it
to
the
boy
!
<EOS>
let
's
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
take
it
out
of
the
paper
,
and
it
prove
to
be
a
good
one
.
"
<EOS>
but
what
be
this
?
"
say
Mrs
Joe
,
throw
down
the
shilling
and
catch
up
the
paper
.
<EOS>
"
two
one
-
pound
note
?
<EOS>
"
  
nothing
less
than
two
fat
swelter
one
-
pound
note
that
seem
to
have
be
on
term
of
the
warm
intimacy
with
all
the
cattle
market
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
Joe
catch
up
his
hat
again
,
and
run
with
them
to
the
Jolly
Bargemen
to
restore
them
to
their
owner
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
go
,
I
sit
down
on
my
usual
stool
and
look
vacantly
at
my
sister
,
feel
pretty
sure
that
the
man
would
not
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
presently
,
Joe
come
back
,
say
that
the
man
be
go
,
but
that
he
,
Joe
,
have
leave
word
at
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
concern
the
note
.
<EOS>
then
my
sister
seal
them
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
put
them
under
some
dry
rose
-
leave
in
an
ornamental
tea
-
pot
on
the
top
of
a
press
in
the
state
parlour
.
<EOS>
there
they
remain
,
a
nightmare
to
me
,
many
and
many
a
night
and
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
sadly
break
sleep
when
I
get
to
bed
,
through
thinking
of
the
strange
man
take
aim
at
me
with
his
invisible
gun
,
and
of
the
guiltily
coarse
and
common
thing
it
be
,
to
be
on
secret
term
of
conspiracy
with
convict
---
<EOS>
a
feature
in
my
low
career
that
I
have
previously
forget
.
<EOS>
I
be
haunt
by
the
file
too
.
<EOS>
a
dread
possess
me
that
when
I
least
expect
it
,
the
file
would
reappear
.
<EOS>
I
coax
myself
to
sleep
by
thinking
of
Miss
Havisham
's
,
next
Wednesday
;
and
in
my
sleep
I
see
the
file
come
at
me
out
of
a
door
,
without
see
who
hold
it
,
and
I
scream
myself
awake
.
    
<EOS>
chapter
11
 
at
<EOS>
the
appoint
time
I
return
to
Miss
Havisham
's
,
and
my
hesitating
ring
at
the
gate
bring
out
Estella
.
<EOS>
She
lock
it
after
admit
me
,
as
she
have
do
before
,
and
again
precede
me
into
the
dark
passage
where
her
candle
stand
.
<EOS>
She
take
no
notice
of
me
until
she
have
the
candle
in
her
hand
,
when
she
look
over
her
shoulder
,
superciliously
say
,
"
You
be
to
come
this
way
to
-
day
,
"
and
take
me
to
quite
another
part
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
passage
be
a
long
one
,
and
seem
to
pervade
the
whole
square
basement
of
the
Manor
House
.
<EOS>
We
traverse
but
one
side
of
the
square
,
however
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
she
stop
,
and
put
her
candle
down
and
open
a
door
.
<EOS>
here
,
the
daylight
reappear
,
and
I
find
myself
in
a
small
pave
court
-
yard
,
the
opposite
side
of
which
be
form
by
a
detached
dwelling
-
house
,
that
look
as
if
it
have
once
belong
to
the
manager
or
head
clerk
of
the
extinct
brewery
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
clock
in
the
outer
wall
of
this
house
.
<EOS>
like
the
clock
in
Miss
Havisham
's
room
,
and
like
Miss
Havisham
's
watch
,
it
have
stop
at
twenty
minute
to
nine
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
in
at
the
door
,
which
stand
open
,
and
into
a
gloomy
room
with
a
low
ceiling
,
on
the
ground
floor
at
the
back
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
company
in
the
room
,
and
Estella
say
to
me
as
she
join
it
,
"
You
be
to
go
and
stand
there
,
boy
,
till
you
be
want
.
"
<EOS>
"
there
'
,
be
the
window
,
I
cross
to
it
,
and
stand
"
there
,
"
in
a
very
uncomfortable
state
of
mind
,
look
out
.
  
<EOS>
It
open
to
the
ground
,
and
look
into
a
most
miserable
corner
of
the
neglect
garden
,
upon
a
rank
ruin
of
cabbage
-
stalk
,
and
one
box
tree
that
have
be
clip
round
long
ago
,
like
a
pudding
,
and
have
a
new
growth
at
the
top
of
it
,
out
of
shape
and
of
a
different
colour
,
as
if
that
part
of
the
pudding
have
stick
to
the
saucepan
and
get
burn
.
<EOS>
this
be
my
homely
think
,
as
I
contemplate
the
box
-
tree
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
some
light
snow
,
overnight
,
and
it
lie
nowhere
else
to
my
knowledge
;
but
,
it
have
not
quite
melted
from
the
cold
shadow
of
this
bit
of
garden
,
and
the
wind
catch
it
up
in
little
eddy
and
throw
it
at
the
window
,
as
if
it
pelt
me
for
come
there
.
  
<EOS>
I
divine
that
my
coming
have
stop
conversation
in
the
room
,
and
that
its
other
occupant
be
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
nothing
of
the
room
except
the
shining
of
the
fire
in
the
window
glass
,
but
I
stiffen
in
all
my
joint
with
the
consciousness
that
I
be
under
close
inspection
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
three
lady
in
the
room
and
one
gentleman
.
<EOS>
before
I
have
be
stand
at
the
window
five
minute
,
they
somehow
convey
to
me
that
they
be
all
toady
and
humbug
,
but
that
each
of
them
pretend
not
to
know
that
the
other
be
toady
and
humbug
:
because
the
admission
that
he
or
she
do
know
it
,
would
have
make
him
or
her
out
to
be
a
toady
and
humbug
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
have
a
listless
and
dreary
air
of
wait
somebody
's
pleasure
,
and
the
most
talkative
of
the
lady
have
to
speak
quite
rigidly
to
repress
a
yawn
.
<EOS>
this
lady
,
whose
name
be
Camilla
,
very
much
remind
me
of
my
sister
,
with
the
difference
that
she
be
old
,
and
(
as
I
find
when
I
catch
sight
of
her
)
of
a
blunter
cast
of
feature
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
when
I
know
her
well
I
begin
to
think
it
be
a
mercy
<EOS>
she
have
any
feature
at
all
,
so
very
blank
and
high
<EOS>
be
the
dead
wall
of
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
dear
soul
!
"
say
this
lady
,
with
an
abruptness
of
manner
quite
my
sister
's
.
<EOS>
"
nobody
's
enemy
but
his
own
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
much
more
commendable
to
be
somebody
else
's
enemy
,
"
say
the
gentleman
;
"
far
more
natural
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cousin
Raymond
,
"
observe
another
lady
,
"
we
be
to
love
our
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>

Sarah
Pocket
,

return
Cousin
Raymond
,
"
if
a
man
be
not
his
own
neighbour
,
who
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pocket
laugh
,
and
Camilla
laugh
and
say
(
check
a
yawn
)
,
"
the
idea
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
they
seem
to
think
it
rather
a
good
idea
too
.
<EOS>
the
other
lady
,
who
have
not
speak
yet
,
say
gravely
and
emphatically
,
"
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
very
\
 
true
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Camilla
presently
go
on
<EOS>
(
I
know
they
have
all
be
look
at
me
in
the
mean
time
)
,
"
he
be
so
very
strange
!
<EOS>
Would
anyone
believe
that
when
Tom
's
wife
die
,
he
actually
could
not
be
induce
to
see
the
importance
of
the
child
's
have
the
deep
of
trimming
to
their
mourning
?
"
<EOS>
good
Lord
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
"
Camilla
,
what
can
it
signify
so
long
as
the
poor
bereave
little
thing
be
in
black
?
"
<EOS>
so
like
Matthew
!
<EOS>
the
idea
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
point
in
him
,
good
point
in
him

"
say
Cousin
Raymond
;
"
Heaven
forbid
I
should
deny
good
point
in
him
;
but
he
never
have
,
and
he
never
will
have

any
sense
of
the
propriety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
be
oblige
,
"
say
Camilla
,
"
I
be
oblige
to
be
firm
.
<EOS>
I
say
:
"
It
will
not
do
,
for
the
credit
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
that
,
without
deep
trimming
,
the
family
be
disgrace
.
<EOS>
I
cry
about
it
from
breakfast
till
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
injure
my
digestion
.
<EOS>
and
at
last
he
fling
out
in
his
violent
way
,
and
say
,
with
a
d
,
"
then
do
as
you
like
.
"
<EOS>
thank
Goodness
it
will
always
be
a
consolation
to
me
to
know
that
I
instantly
go
out
in
a
pour
rain
and
buy
the
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"

<EOS>
He

pay
for
them

do
he
not

ask
Estella
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
the
question
,
my
dear
child
,
who
pay
for
them
,

return
Camilla
.
<EOS>
"
I
buy
them
.
<EOS>
and
I
shall
often
think
of
that
with
peace
,
when
I
wake
up
in
the
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
ringing
of
a
distant
bell
,
combine
with
the
echoing
of
some
cry
or
call
along
the
passage
by
which
I
have
come
,
interrupt
the
conversation
and
cause
Estella
to
say
to
me
,
"
now
,
boy
!
"
<EOS>
on
my
turning
round
,
they
all
look
at
me
with
the
utmost
contempt
,
and
,
as
I
go
out
,
I
hear
Sarah
Pocket
say
,
"
well
I
be
sure
!
<EOS>
what
next
!

<EOS>
and
Camilla
add

with
indignation

be
there
ever
such
a

the

<EOS>
as
we
be
go
with
our
candle
along
the
dark
passage
,
Estella
stop
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
,
face
round
,
say
in
her
taunting
manner
with
her
face
quite
close
to
mine
:
  
"
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
miss
?
<EOS>
"
I
answer
,
almost
fall
over
her
and
check
myself
.
  
<EOS>
She
stand
look
at
me
,
and
,
of
course
,
I
stand
look
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
pretty
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
think
you
be
very
pretty

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
insult

<EOS>
"
  
"
not

I.
  
<EOS>

not

"
no

She
fire
when
she
ask
the
last
question

and
she
slap
my
face
with
such
force
as
she
have
,
when
I
answer
it

<EOS>

now
?

say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
little
coarse
monster

what
do
you

of
me
now

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
shall
not

up

no

why
do
not
you
cry
again
,
<EOS>
you
little
wretch

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
will
never

you
again

"
say
I.
which
be
,
I
suppose
,
as
false
a
declaration
as
ever
be
make
;
for
I
be
inwardly
cry
for
her
then
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
know
of
the
pain
<EOS>
she
cost
me
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
on
our
way
up
-
stair
after
this
episode
;
and
,
as
we
be
go
up
,
we
meet
a
gentleman
grope
his
way
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
whom
have
we
here
?
"
ask
the
gentleman
,
stop
and
look
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
boy
,
"
say
Estella
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
burly
man
of
an
exceedingly
dark
complexion
,
with
an
exceedingly
large
head
and
a
corresponding
large
hand
.
<EOS>
He
take
my
chin
in
his
large
hand
and
turn
up
my
face
to
have
a
look
at
me
by
the
light
of
the
candle
.
<EOS>
He
be
prematurely
bald
on
the
top
of
his
head
,
and
have
bushy
black
eyebrow
that
would
not
lie
down
but
stand
up
bristle
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
set
very
deep
in
his
head
,
and
be
disagreeably
sharp
and
suspicious
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
large
watch
-
chain
,
and
strong
black
dot
where
his
beard
and
whisker
would
have
be
if
he
have
let
them
.
<EOS>
He
be
nothing
to
me
,
and
I
could
have
have
no
foresight
then
,
that
he
ever
would
be
anything
to
me
,
but
it
happen
that
I
have
this
opportunity
of
observe
him
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
boy
of
the
neighbourhood
?
<EOS>
hey
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Havisham
send
for
me
,
sir
,
"
I
explain
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
behave
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
pretty
large
experience
of
boy
,
and
you
be
a
bad
set
of
fellow
.
<EOS>
now
mind
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
bite
the
side
of
his
great
forefinger
as
he
frown
at
me
,
"
you
behave
yourself
!
"
  
<EOS>
with
those
word
,
he
release
me
---
which
I
be
glad
of
,
for
his
hand
smelt
of
scented
soap
---
and
go
his
way
down
-
stair
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
he
could
be
a
doctor
;
but
no
,
I
think
;
he
could
not
be
a
doctor
,
or
he
would
have
a
quieter
and
more
persuasive
manner
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
time
to
consider
the
subject
,
for
we
be
soon
in
Miss
Havisham
's
room
,
where
she
and
everything
else
be
just
as
I
have
leave
them
.
<EOS>
Estella
leave
me
stand
near
the
door
,
and
I
stand
there
until
Miss
Havisham
cast
her
eye
upon
me
from
the
dressing
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
!
<EOS>
"
she
say
,
without
be
startled
or
surprised
;
"
the
day
have
wear
away
,
have
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
be
---
"
  
"
there
,
there
,
there
!
"
<EOS>
with
the
impatient
movement
of
her
finger
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
be
you
ready
to
play
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
answer
in
some
confusion
,
"
I
do
not
think
I
be
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
at
card
again
?
<EOS>
"
she
demand
,
with
a
searching
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
;
I
could
do
that
,
if
I
be
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
since
this
house
strike
you
old
and
grave
,
boy
,
"
say
Miss
Havisham
,
impatiently
,
"
and
you
be
unwilling
to
play
,
be
you
willing
to
work
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
answer
this
inquiry
with
a
well
heart
than
I
have
be
able
to
find
for
the
other
question
,
and
I
say
I
be
quite
willing
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
go
into
that
opposite
room
,
"
say
she
,
point
at
the
door
behind
me
with
her
withered
hand
,
"
and
wait
there
till
I
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
cross
the
staircase
landing
,
and
enter
the
room
she
indicate
.
<EOS>
from
that
room
,
too
,
the
daylight
be
completely
exclude
,
and
it
have
an
airless
smell
that
be
oppressive
.
<EOS>
a
fire
have
be
lately
kindle
in
the
damp
old
-
fashioned
grate
,
and
it
be
more
disposed
to
go
out
than
to
burn
up
,
and
the
reluctant
smoke
which
hang
in
the
room
seem
cold
than
the
clear
air
---
like
our
own
marsh
mist
.
<EOS>
certain
wintry
branch
of
candle
on
the
high
chimneypiece
faintly
light
the
chamber
:
or
,
it
would
be
more
expressive
to
say
,
faintly
trouble
its
darkness
.
<EOS>
It
be
spacious
,
and
I
dare
say
have
once
be
handsome
,
but
every
discernible
thing
in
it
be
cover
with
dust
and
mould
,
and
drop
to
piece
.
<EOS>
the
most
prominent
object
be
a
long
table
with
a
table
-
cloth
spread
on
it
,
as
if
a
feast
have
be
in
preparation
when
the
house
and
the
clock
all
stop
together
.
<EOS>
an
epergne
or
centre
-
piece
of
some
kind
be
in
the
middle
of
this
cloth
;
it
be
so
heavily
overhung
with
cobwebs
that
its
form
be
quite
undistinguishable
;
and
,
as
I
look
along
the
yellow
expanse
out
of
which
<EOS>
I
remember
its
seeming
to
grow
,
like
a
black
fungus
,
I
see
speckle
-
legged
spider
with
blotchy
body
run
home
to
it
,
and
run
out
from
it
,
as
if
some
circumstance
of
the
great
public
importance
have
just
transpire
in
the
spider
community
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
the
mouse
too
,
rattle
behind
the
panel
,
as
if
the
same
occurrence
be
important
to
their
interest
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
blackbeetle
take
no
notice
of
the
agitation
,
and
grope
about
the
hearth
in
a
ponderous
elderly
way
,
as
if
they
be
short
-
sighted
and
hard
of
hearing
,
and
not
on
term
with
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
these
crawl
thing
have
fascinate
my
attention
<EOS>
and
I
be
watch
them
from
a
distance
,
when
Miss
Havisham
lay
a
hand
upon
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
in
her
other
hand
she
have
a
crutch
-
head
stick
on
which
she
lean
,
and
she
look
like
the
Witch
of
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
,
"
say
she
,
point
to
the
long
table
with
her
stick
,
"
be
where
I
will
be
lay
when
I
be
dead
.
<EOS>
They
shall
come
and
look
at
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
some
vague
misgiving
that
she
may
get
upon
the
table
then
and
there
and
die
at
once
,
the
complete
realization
of
the
ghastly
waxwork
at
the
Fair
,
I
shrink
under
her
touch
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
that
be
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
me
,
again
point
with
her
stick
;
"
that
,
where
those
cobwebs
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
guess
what
it
be
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
great
cake
.
<EOS>
a
bride
-
cake
.
<EOS>
mine
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
all
round
the
room
in
a
glaring
manner
,
and
then
say
,
lean
on
me
while
her
hand
twitch
my
shoulder
,
"
come
,
come
,
come
!
<EOS>
walk
me
,
walk
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
make
out
from
this
,
that
the
work
I
have
to
do
,
be
to
walk
Miss
Havisham
round
and
round
the
room
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
start
at
once
,
and
she
lean
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
we
go
away
at
a
pace
that
may
have
be
an
imitation
(
found
on
my
first
impulse
under
that
roof
)
of
Mr
Pumblechook
's
chaise
-
cart
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
not
physically
strong
,
and
after
a
little
time
say
,
"
slow
!
"
<EOS>
still
,
we
go
at
an
impatient
fitful
speed
,
and
as
we
go
,
she
twitch
the
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
work
her
mouth
,
and
lead
me
to
believe
that
we
be
go
fast
because
her
thought
go
fast
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
she
say
,
"
call
Estella
!
"
<EOS>
so
I
go
out
on
the
landing
and
roar
that
name
as
I
have
do
on
the
previous
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mien
her
light
appear
,
I
return
to
Miss
Havisham
,
and
we
start
away
again
round
and
round
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
if
only
Estella
have
come
to
be
a
spectator
of
our
proceeding
,
I
should
have
feel
sufficiently
discontent
;
but
,
as
she
bring
with
her
the
three
lady
and
the
gentleman
whom
I
have
see
below
,
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
in
my
politeness
,
I
would
have
stop
;
but
,
Miss
Havisham
twitch
my
shoulder
,
and
we
post
on
---
with
a
shame
-
face
consciousness
on
my
part
that
they
would
think
it
be
all
my
doing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear

Miss

Camilla
brighten
when
Miss
Pocket
meet
with
this
rebuff
;
and
she
murmur
,
as
she
plaintively
contemplate
Miss
Havisham
,
"
poor
dear
soul

<EOS>
certainly
not

how

say
Miss
Havisham
to
Camilla

<EOS>
as
we
be
close
to
Camilla
then
,
I
would
have
stop
as
a
matter
of
course
,
only
Miss
Havisham
would
not
stop
.
<EOS>
We
sweep
on
,
and
I
feel
that
I

highly
obnoxious
to
Camilla

<EOS>
ask
Miss

with

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

here
Camilla
put
her

to
her

at

the
object

love

duty
,
for
even
so
short
a
time

I
shall

melancholy
satisfaction

up

I

it

very
hard

Mr

as
Mrs

hand
upon
her
heave
bosom

that
lady
assume
an
unnatural
fortitude
of
manner
which
I
suppose
to
be
expressive
of
an
intention
to
drop
and
choke
when
out

Sarah
be

round
Georgiana

artful
slipperiness

forgiving
pity

down

still

more

more
slowly

at
last
she
stop
before
the
fire

after
mutter

look
at
it
some
second
:

remain
quiet

<EOS>
Estella
return
,
and
she
too
remain
quiet
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
we
continue
thus
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
in
the
heavy
air
of
the
room
,
and
the
heavy
darkness
that
brood
in
its
remoter
corner
,
I
even
have
an
alarming
fancy
that
Estella
and
I
may
presently
begin
to
decay
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
not
come
out
of
her
distraught
state
by
degree
,
but
in
an
instant
,
Miss
Havisham
say
,
"
let
me
see
you
two
play
card
;
why
have
you
not
begin
?
"
<EOS>
with
that
,
we
return
to
her
room
,
and
sit
down
as
before
;
I
be
beggar
,
as
before
;
and
again
,
as
before
,
Miss
Havisham
watch
us
all
the
time
,
direct
my
attention
to
Estella
's
beauty
,
and
make
me
notice
it
the
more
by
try
her
jewel
on
Estella
's
breast
and
hair
.
  
<EOS>
Estella
,
for
her
part
,
likewise
treat
me
as
before
;
except
that
she
do
not
condescend
to
speak
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
play
some
half
-
dozen
game
,
a
day
be
appoint
for
my
return
,
and
I
be
take
down
into
the
yard
to
be
feed
in
the
former
dog
-
like
manner
.
<EOS>
there
,
too
,
I
be
again
leave
to
wander
about
as
I
like
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
much
to
the
purpose
whether
a
gate
in
that
garden
wall
which
I
have
scramble
up
to
peep
over
on
the
last
occasion
be
,
on
that
last
occasion
,
open
or
shut
.
<EOS>
enough
that
I
see
no
gate
then
,
and
that
I
see
one
now
.
<EOS>
as
it
stand
open
,
and
as
I
know
that
Estella
have
let
the
visitor
out
---
for
,
she
have
return
with
the
key
in
her
hand
---
I
stroll
into
the
garden
and
stroll
all
over
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
wilderness
,
and
there
be
old
melon
-
frame
and
cucumber
-
frame
in
it
,
which
seem
in
their
decline
to
have
produce
a
spontaneous
growth
of
weak
attempt
at
piece
of
old
hat
and
boot
,
with
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
weedy
offshoot
into
the
likeness
of
a
battered
saucepan
.
  
<EOS>
men
I
have
exhaust
the
garden
,
and
a
greenhouse
with
nothing
in
it
but
a
fall
-
down
grape
-
vine
and
some
bottle
,
I
find
myself
in
the
dismal
corner
upon
which
I
have
look
out
of
window
.
<EOS>
never
question
for
a
moment
that
the
house
be
now
empty
,
I
look
in
at
another
window
,
and
find
myself
,
to
my
great
surprise
,
exchange
a
broad
stare
with
a
pale
young
gentleman
with
red
eyelid
and
light
hair
.
  
<EOS>
this
pale
young
gentleman
quickly
disappear
,
and
re
-
appeared
beside
me
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
at
his
book
when
I
have
find
myself
stare
at
him
,
and
I
now
see
that
he
be
inky
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa

say
he
,
"
young
fellow
!
"
  
<EOS>
Halloa
be
a
general
observation
which
I
have
usually
observe
to
be
best
answer
by
itself
,
I
say
,
"
Halloa
!
"
<EOS>
politely
omit
young
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
let
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
you
\
 
<EOS>
in
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Estella
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
give
you
leave
to
prowl
about
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Estella
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
come
and
fight
,
"
say
the
pale
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
but
follow
him
?
<EOS>
I
have
often
ask
myself
the
question
since
:
<EOS>
but
,
what
else
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
His
manner
be
so
final
<EOS>
and
I
be
so
astonished
,
that
I
follow
where
he
lead
,
as
if
I
have
be
under
a
spell
.
  
<EOS>
"
stop
a
minute
,
though
,
"
he
say
,
wheel
round
before
we
have
go
many
pace
.
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
give
you
a
reason
for
fighting
,
too
.
<EOS>
there
it
be
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
most
irritating
manner
he
instantly
slap
his
hand
against
one
another
,
daintily
fling
one
of
his
leg
up
behind
him
,
pull
my
hair
,
slap
his
hand
again
,
dip
his
head
,
and
butt
it
into
my
stomach
.
  
<EOS>
the
bull
-
like
proceeding
last
mention
,
besides
that
it
be
unquestionably
to
be
regard
in
the
light
of
a
liberty
,
be
particularly
disagreeable
just
after
bread
and
meat
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
hit
out
at
him
and
be
go
to
hit
out
again
,
when
he
say
,
"
<EOS>
aha
!
<EOS>
Would
you
?
"
and
begin
dance
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
manner
quite
unparalleled
within
my
limited
experience
.
  
<EOS>
"
law
of
the
game
!
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
here
,
he
skip
from
his
left
leg
on
to
his
right
.
"
<EOS>
regular
rule
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
,
he
skip
from
his
right
leg
on
to
his
left
.
<EOS>
"
come
to
the
ground
,
and
go
through
the
preliminary
!
"
<EOS>
here
,
he
dodge
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
do
all
sort
of
thing
while
I
look
helplessly
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
secretly
afraid
of
him
when
I
see
him
so
dexterous
;
but
,
<EOS>
I
feel
morally
and
physically
convinced
that
his
light
head
of
hair
could
have
have
no
business
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
,
and
that
I
have
a
right
to
consider
it
irrelevant
when
so
obtruded
on
my
attention
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
I
follow
him
without
a
word
,
to
a
retire
nook
of
the
garden
,
form
by
the
junction
of
two
wall
and
screen
by
some
rubbish
.
<EOS>
on
his
ask
me
if
I
be
satisfied
with
the
ground
,
and
on
my
replying
yes
,
he
beg
my
leave
to
absent
himself
for
a
moment
,
and
quickly
return
with
a
bottle
of
water
and
a
sponge
dip
in
vinegar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
available
for
both
,
"
he
say
,
place
these
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
and
then
fall
to
pull
off
,
not
only
his
jacket
and
waistcoat
,
but
his
shirt
too
,
in
a
manner
at
once
light
-
hearted
,
businesslike
,
and
bloodthirsty
.
  
<EOS>
although
he
do
not
look
very
healthy
---
have
pimple
on
his
face
,
and
a
breaking
out
at
his
mouth
---
these
dreadful
preparation
quite
appal
me
.
<EOS>
I
judge
him
to
be
about
my
own
age
,
but
he
be
much
tall
,
and
he
have
a
way
of
spin
himself
about
that
be
full
of
appearance
.
<EOS>
for
the
rest
,
he
be
a
young
gentleman
in
a
grey
suit
(
when
not
denude
for
battle
)
,
with
his
elbow
,
knee
,
wrist
,
and
heel
,
considerably
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
him
as
to
development
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
fail
me
when
I
see
him
square
at
me
with
every
demonstration
of
mechanical
nicety
,
and
eye
my
anatomy
as
if
he
be
minutely
choose
his
bone
.
<EOS>
I
never
have
be
so
surprised
in
my
life
,
as
I
be
when
I
let
out
the
first
blow
,
and
see
him
lie
on
his
back
,
look
up
at
me
with
a
bloody
nose
and
his
face
exceedingly
fore
-
shorten
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
he
be
on
his
foot
directly
,
and
after
sponge
himself
with
a
great
show
of
dexterity
begin
square
again
.
<EOS>
the
second
great
surprise
I
have
ever
have
in
my
life
be
see
him
on
his
back
again
,
look
up
at
me
out
of
a
black
eye
.
  
<EOS>
His
spirit
inspire
me
with
great
respect
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
no
strength
,
and
he
never
once
hit
me
hard
,
and
he
be
always
knock
down
;
but
,
he
would
be
up
again
in
a
moment
,
sponge
himself
or
drink
out
of
the
water
-
bottle
,
with
the
great
satisfaction
in
second
himself
accord
to
form
,
and
then
come
at
me
with
an
air
and
a
show
that
make
me
believe
he
really
be
go
to
do
for
me
at
last
.
<EOS>
He
get
heavily
bruise
,
for
I
be
sorry
to
record
that
the
more
I
hit
him
,
the
hard
I
hit
him
;
but
,
he
come
up
again
and
again
and
again
,
until
at
last
he
get
a
bad
fall
with
the
back
of
his
head
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
even
after
that
crisis
in
our
affair
,
he
get
up
and
turn
round
and
round
confusedly
a
few
time
,
not
know
where
I
be
;
but
finally
go
on
his
knee
to
his
sponge
and
throw
it
up
:
at
the
same
time
pant
out
,
"
that
mean
you
have
win
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
seem
so
brave
and
innocent
,
<EOS>
that
although
I
have
not
propose
the
contest
I
feel
but
a
gloomy
satisfaction
in
my
victory
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
go
so
far
as
to
hope
that
I
regard
myself
while
dress
,
as
a
species
of
savage
young
wolf
,
or
other
wild
beast
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
get
dress
,
darkly
wipe
my
sanguinary
face
at
interval
,
and
I
say
,
"
Can
I
help
you
?
"
<EOS>
and
he
say
"
<EOS>
no
thankee
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
say
"
<EOS>
good
afternoon
,
"
and
 
\
<EOS>
he
\
 
<EOS>
say
"
same
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
I
get
into
the
court
-
yard
,
I
find
Estella
wait
with
the
key
.
<EOS>
but
,
she
neither
ask
me
where
I
have
be
,
nor
why
I
have
keep
her
wait
;
and
there
be
a
bright
flush
upon
her
face
,
as
though
something
have
happen
to
delight
her
.
<EOS>
instead
of
go
straight
to
the
gate
,
too
,
she
step
back
into
the
passage
,
and
beckon
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
here
!
<EOS>
You
may
kiss
me
,
if
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
kiss
her
cheek
as
she
turn
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
would
have
go
through
a
great
deal
to
kiss
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
feel
that
the
kiss
be
give
to
the
coarse
common
boy
as
a
piece
of
money
may
have
be
,
and
that
it
be
worth
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
what
with
the
birthday
visitor
,
and
what
with
the
card
,
and
what
with
the
fight
,
my
stay
have
last
so
long
,
that
when
I
near
home
the
light
on
the
spit
of
sand
off
the
point
on
the
marsh
be
gleam
against
a
black
night
-
sky
,
and
Joe
's
furnace
be
fling
a
path
of
fire
across
the
road
.
    
<EOS>
chapter
12
 
my
mind
grow
very
uneasy
on
the
subject
of
the
pale
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
think
of
the
fight
,
and
recall
the
pale
young
gentleman
on
his
back
in
various
stage
of
puffy
and
incrimsoned
countenance
,
<EOS>
the
more
certain
it
appear
that
something
would
be
do
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
the
pale
young
gentleman
's
blood
be
on
my
head
,
and
that
the
Law
would
avenge
it
.
<EOS>
without
have
any
definite
idea
of
the
penalty
I
have
incur
,
it
be
clear
to
me
that
village
boy
could
not
go
stalk
about
the
country
,
ravage
the
house
of
gentlefolk
and
pitch
into
the
studious
youth
of
England
,
without
lay
themselves
open
to
severe
punishment
.
<EOS>
for
some
day
,
I
even
keep
close
at
home
,
and
look
out
at
the
kitchen
door
with
the
great
caution
and
trepidation
before
go
on
an
errand
,
lest
the
officer
of
the
County
Jail
should
pounce
upon
me
.
<EOS>
the
pale
young
gentleman
's
nose
have
stain
my
trouser
,
and
I
try
to
wash
out
that
evidence
of
my
guilt
in
the
dead
of
night
.
<EOS>
I
have
cut
my
knuckle
against
the
pale
young
gentleman
's
tooth
,
and
I
twist
my
imagination
into
a
thousand
tangle
,
as
I
devise
incredible
way
of
account
for
that
damnatory
circumstance
when
I
should
be
hale
before
the
Judges
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
day
come
round
for
my
return
to
the
scene
of
the
deed
of
violence
,
my
terror
reach
their
height
.
<EOS>
whether
myrmidon
of
Justice
,
specially
send
down
from
London
,
would
be
lie
in
ambush
behind
the
gate
?
<EOS>
whether
Miss
Havisham
,
prefer
to
take
personal
vengeance
for
an
outrage
do
to
her
house
,
may
rise
in
those
grave
-
clothe
of
her
,
draw
a
pistol
,
and
shoot
me
dead
?
<EOS>
whether
suborn
boy
---
a
numerous
band
of
mercenary
---
may
be
engage
to
fall
upon
me
in
the
brewery
,
and
cuff
me
until
I
be
no
more
?
<EOS>
It
be
high
testimony
to
my
confidence
in
the
spirit
of
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
that
I
never
imagine
 
<EOS>
\
him
<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
accessory
to
these
retaliation
<EOS>
;
they
always
come
into
my
mind
as
the
act
of
injudicious
relative
of
his
,
goad
on
by
the
state
of
his
visage
and
an
indignant
sympathy
with
the
family
feature
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
go
to
Miss
Havisham
's
I
must
,
and
go
I
do
.
<EOS>
and
behold
!
<EOS>
nothing
come
of
the
late
struggle
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
allude
to
in
any
way
,
and
no
pale
young
gentleman
be
to
be
discover
on
the
premise
.
<EOS>
I
find
the
same
gate
open
,
and
I
explore
the
garden
and
even
look
in
at
the
window
of
the
detached
house
;
but
,
my
view
be
suddenly
stop
by
the
close
shutter
within
,
and
all
be
lifeless
.
<EOS>
only
in
the
corner
where
the
combat
have
take
place
,
could
I
detect
any
evidence
of
the
young
gentleman
's
existence
.
<EOS>
there
be
trace
of
his
gore
in
that
spot
,
and
I
cover
them
with
garden
-
mould
from
the
eye
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
broad
landing
between
Miss
Havisham
's
own
room
and
that
other
room
in
which
the
long
table
be
lay
out
<EOS>
,
I
see
a
garden
-
chair
---
a
light
chair
on
wheel
,
that
you
push
from
behind
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
place
there
since
my
last
visit
,
and
I
enter
,
that
same
day
,
on
a
regular
occupation
of
push
Miss
Havisham
in
this
chair
<EOS>
(
when
she
be
tired
of
walk
with
her
hand
upon
my
shoulder
)
round
her
own
room
,
and
across
the
landing
,
and
round
the
other
room
.
<EOS>
over
and
over
and
over
again
,
we
would
make
these
journey
,
and
sometimes
they
would
last
as
long
as
three
hour
at
a
stretch
.
<EOS>
I
insensibly
full
into
a
general
mention
of
these
journey
as
numerous
,
because
it
be
at
once
settle
that
I
should
return
every
alternate
day
at
noon
for
these
purpose
,
and
because
I
be
now
go
to
sum
up
a
period
of
at
least
eight
or
ten
month
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
begin
to
be
more
used
to
one
another
,
Miss
Havisham
talk
more
to
me
,
and
ask
me
such
question
as
what
have
I
learn
and
what
be
I
go
to
be
?
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
be
go
to
be
apprentice
to
Joe
,
I
believe
;
and
I
enlarge
upon
my
know
nothing
and
want
to
know
everything
,
in
the
hope
that
she
may
offer
some
help
towards
that
desirable
end
.
<EOS>
but
,
she
do
not
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
seem
to
prefer
my
be
ignorant
.
<EOS>
neither
do
she
ever
give
me
any
money
---
or
anything
but
my
daily
dinner
---
nor
even
stipulate
that
I
should
be
pay
for
my
service
.
  
<EOS>
Estella
be
always
about
,
and
always
let
me
in
and
out
,
but
never
tell
me
I
may
kiss
her
again
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
she
would
coldly
tolerate
me
;
sometimes
,
she
would
condescend
to
me
;
sometimes
,
she
would
be
quite
familiar
with
me
;
sometimes
,
she
would
tell
me
energetically
that
she
hate
me
.
<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
would
often
ask
me
in
a
whisper
,
or
when
we
be
alone
,
"
do
she
grow
pretty
and
pretty
,
Pip
?
"
<EOS>
and
when
I
say
yes
(
for
indeed
she
do
)
,
would
seem
to
enjoy
it
greedily
.
<EOS>
also
,
when
we
play
at
card
Miss
Havisham
would
look
on
,
with
a
miserly
relish
of
Estella
's
mood
,
whatever
they
be
.
<EOS>
and
sometimes
,
when
her
mood
be
so
many
and
so
contradictory
of
one
another
that
I
be
puzzle
what
to
say
or
do
,
Miss
Havisham
would
embrace
her
with
lavish
fondness
,
murmur
something
in
her
ear
that
sound
like
"
break
their
heart
my
pride
and
hope
,
break
their
heart
and
have
no
mercy
!
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
song
Joe
use
to
hum
fragment
of
at
the
forge
,
of
which
the
burden
be
Old
Clem
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
a
very
ceremonious
way
of
render
homage
to
a
patron
saint
;
but
,
I
believe
Old
Clem
stand
in
that
relation
towards
smith
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
song
that
imitate
the
measure
of
beat
upon
iron
,
and
be
a
mere
lyrical
excuse
for
the
introduction
of
Old
Clem
's
respected
name
.
<EOS>
thus
,
you
be
to
hammer
boy
round
---
Old
Clem
!
<EOS>
with
a
thump
and
a
sound
---
Old
Clem
!
<EOS>
beat
it
out
,
beat
it
out
---
Old
Clem
!
<EOS>
with
a
clink
for
the
stout
---
Old
Clem
!
<EOS>
blow
the
fire
,
blow
the
fire
---
Old
Clem
!
<EOS>
roar
dryer
,
soar
high
---
Old
Clem
!

one
day
soon
after
the
appearance
of
the
chair
,
Miss
Havisham
suddenly
say
to
me
with
the
impatient
movement
of
her
finger
,
"
there
,
there
,
there
!
<EOS>
sing
!
"
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
into
croon
this
ditty
as
I
push
her
over
the
floor
.
<EOS>
It
happen
so
to
catch
her
fancy
,
that
she
take
it
up
in
a
low
brooding
voice
as
if
she
be
singe
in
her
sleep
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
it
become
customary
with
us
to
have
it
as
we
move
about
,
and
Estella
would
often
join
in
;
though
the
whole
strain
be
so
subdue
,
even
when
there
be
three
of
us
,
that
it
make
less
noise
in
the
grim
old
house
than
the
light
breath
of
wind
.
  
<EOS>
what
could
I
become
with
these
surrounding
?
<EOS>
how
could
my
character
fail
to
be
influence
by
them
?
<EOS>
be
it
to
be
wonder
at
if
my
thought
be
daze
,
as
my
eye
be
,
when
I
come
out
into
the
natural
light
from
the
misty
yellow
room
?
  
<EOS>
perhaps
,
I
may
have
tell
Joe
about
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
if
I
have
not
previously
be
betray
into
those
enormous
invention
to
which
I
have
confess
.
<EOS>
under
the
circumstance
,
I
feel
that
Joe
could
hardly
fail
to
discern
in
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
an
appropriate
passenger
to
be
put
into
the
black
velvet
coach
;
therefore
,
I
say
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
besides
:
that
shrink
from
have
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
discuss
,
which
have
come
upon
me
in
the
beginning
,
grow
much
more
potent
as
time
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
repose
complete
confidence
in
no
one
but
Biddy
;
but
,
I
tell
poor
Biddy
everything
.
<EOS>
why
it
come
natural
to
me
to
do
so
,
and
why
Biddy
have
a
deep
concern
in
everything
I
tell
her
,
I
do
not
know
then
,
though
I
think
I
know
now
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
council
go
on
in
the
kitchen
at
home
,
fraught
with
almost
insupportable
aggravation
to
my
exasperate
spirit
.
<EOS>
that
ass
,
Pumblechook
,
use
often
to
come
over
of
a
night
for
the
purpose
of
discuss
my
prospect
with
my
sister
;
and
I
really
do
believe
(
to
this
hour
with
less
penitence
than
I
ought
to
feel
)
,
that
if
these
hand
could
have
take
a
linchpin
out
of
his
chaise
-
cart
,
they
would
have
do
it
.
<EOS>
the
miserable
man
be
a
man
of
that
confine
stolidity
of
mind
,
that
he
could
not
discuss
my
prospect
without
have
me
before
him
---
as
it
be
,
to
operate
upon
---
and
he
would
drag
me
up
from
my
stool
(
usually
by
the
collar
)
where
I
be
quiet
in
a
comer
,
and
,
put
me
before
the
fire
as
if
I
be
go
to
be
cook
,
would
begin
by
say
,
"
now
,
Mum
,
here
be
this
boy
!
<EOS>
here
be
this
boy
which
you
bring
up
by
hand
.
<EOS>
hold
up
your
head
,
boy
,
and
be
for
ever
grateful
unto
them
which
so
do
do
.
<EOS>
now
,
Mum
,
with
respection
to
this
boy
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
would
rumple
my
hair
the
wrong
way
---
which
from
my
early
remembrance
,
as
already
hint
,
I
have
in
my
soul
deny
the
right
of
any
fellow
-
creature
to
do
---
and
would
hold
me
before
him
by
the
sleeve
:
<EOS>
a
spectacle
of
imbecility
only
to
be
equal
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
he
and
my
sister
would
pair
off
in
such
nonsensical
speculation
about
Miss
Havisham
,
and
about
what
she
would
do
with
me
and
for
me
,
that
I
use
to
want
---
quite
painfully
---
to
burst
into
spiteful
tear
,
fly
at
Pumblechook
,
and
pummel
him
all
over
.
<EOS>
in
these
dialogue
,
my
sister
speak
to
me
as
if
she
be
morally
wrench
one
of
my
tooth
out
at
every
reference
;
while
Pumblechook
himself
,
self
-
constitute
my
patron
,
would
sit
supervise
me
with
a
depreciatory
eye
,
like
the
architect
of
my
fortune
who
think
himself
engage
on
a
very
unremunerative
job
.
  
<EOS>
in
these
discussion
,
Joe
bear
no
part
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
often
talk
at
,
while
they
be
in
progress
,
by
reason
of
Mrs
Joe
's
perceiving
that
he
be
not
favourable
to
my
be
take
from
the
forge
.
<EOS>
I
be
fully
old
enough
now
,
to
be
apprentice
to
Joe
;
and
when
Joe
sit
with
the
poker
on
his
knee
thoughtfully
rake
out
the
ashe
between
the
low
bar
,
my
sister
would
so
distinctly
construe
that
innocent
action
into
opposition
on
his
part
,
that
she
would
dive
at
him
,
take
the
poker
out
of
his
hand
,
shake
him
,
and
put
it
away
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
most
irritating
end
to
every
one
of
these
debate
.
<EOS>
all
in
a
moment
,
with
nothing
to
lead
up
to
it
,
my
sister
would
stop
herself
in
a
yawn
,
and
catch
sight
of
me
as
it
be
incidentally
,
would
swoop
upon
me
with
,
"
come
!
<EOS>
there
be
enough
of
 
\
you
!
<EOS>
You
\
 
get
along
to
bed
;
you
have
give
trouble
enough
for
one
night
,
I
hope
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
if
I
have
beseech
them
as
a
favour
to
bother
my
life
out
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
on
in
this
way
for
a
long
time
,
and
it
seem
likely
that
we
should
continue
to
go
on
in
this
way
for
a
long
time
,
when
,
one
day
,
Miss
Havisham
stop
short
as
she
and
I
be
walk
,
she
lean
on
my
shoulder
;
and
say
with
some
displeasure
:
  
"
You
be
grow
tall
,
Pip
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
best
to
hint
,
through
the
medium
of
a
meditative
look
,
that
this
may
be
occasion
by
circumstance
over
which
I
have
no
control
.
  
<EOS>
She
say
no
more
at
the
time
;
but
,
she
presently
stop
and
look
at
me
again
;
and
presently
again
;
and
after
that
,
look
frown
and
moody
.
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
of
my
attendance
when
our
usual
exercise
be
over
,
and
I
have
land
her
at
her
dressing
-
table
,
she
stay
me
with
a
movement
of
her
impatient
finger
:
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
the
name
again
of
that
blacksmith
of
yours
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Joe
Gargery
,
madam
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
mean
the
master
you
be
to
be
apprentice
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Miss
Havisham
.
"
  
"
You
have
better
be
apprentice
at
once
.
<EOS>
Would
Gargery
come
here
with
you
,
and
bring
your
indenture
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
signify
that
I
have
no
doubt
he
would
take
it
as
an
honour
to
be
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
let
him
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
particular
time
,
Miss
Havisham
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
there
!
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
about
time
.
<EOS>
let
him
come
soon
,
and
come
alone
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
I
get
home
at
night
,
and
deliver
this
message
for
Joe
,
my
sister
"
go
on
the
rampage
,
"
in
a
more
alarming
degree
than
at
any
previous
period
.
<EOS>
She
ask
me
and
Joe
whether
we
suppose
she
be
door
-
mat
under
our
foot
,
and
how
we
dare
to
use
her
so
,
and
what
company
we
graciously
think
she
 
\
<EOS>
be
\
 
<EOS>
fit
for
?
<EOS>
when
she
have
exhaust
a
torrent
of
such
inquiry
,
she
throw
a
candle
-
stick
at
Joe
,
burst
into
a
loud
sobbing
,
get
out
the
dustpan
---
which
be
always
a
very
bad
sign
---
put
on
her
coarse
apron
,
and
begin
clean
up
to
a
terrible
extent
.
<EOS>
not
satisfied
with
a
dry
cleaning
,
she
take
to
a
pail
and
scrubbing
-
brush
,
and
clean
us
out
of
house
and
home
,
so
that
we
stand
shiver
in
the
back
-
yard
.
<EOS>
It
be
ten
o'clock
at
night
before
we
venture
to
creep
in
again
,
and
then
she
ask
Joe
why
he
have
not
marry
a
Negress
Slave
at
once
?
<EOS>
Joe
offer
no
answer
,
poor
fellow
,
but
stand
feel
his
whisker
and
look
dejectedly
at
me
,
as
if
he
think
it
really
may
have
be
a
well
speculation
.
    
<EOS>
chapter
13
 
it
be
a
trial
to
my
feeling
on
the
next
day
but
one
,
to
see
Joe
array
himself
in
his
Sunday
clothe
to
accompany
me
to
Miss
Havisham
's
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
he
think
his
court
-
suit
necessary
to
the
occasion
,
it
be
not
for
me
to
tell
him
that
he
look
far
better
in
his
work
dress
;
the
rather
,
because
I
know
he
make
himself
so
dreadfully
uncomfortable
,
entirely
on
my
account
,
and
that
it
be
for
me
he
pull
up
his
shirt
-
collar
<EOS>
so
very
high
behind
,
that
it
make
the
hair
on
the
crown
of
his
head
stand
up
like
a
tuft
of
feather
.
  
<EOS>
at
breakfast
time
my
sister
declare
her
intention
of
go
to
town
with
us
,
and
be
leave
at
Uncle
Pumblechook
's
,
and
call
for
"
when
we
have
do
with
our
fine
lady
"
---
a
way
of
put
the
case
,
from
which
Joe
appear
inclined
to
augur
the
bad
.
<EOS>
the
forge
be
shut
up
for
the
day
,
and
Joe
inscribe
in
chalk
upon
the
door
(
as
it
be
his
custom
to
do
on
the
very
rare
occasion
when
he
be
not
at
work
)
<EOS>
the
monosyllable
HOUT
,
accompany
by
a
sketch
of
an
arrow
suppose
to
be
fly
in
the
direction
he
have
take
.
  
<EOS>
We
walk
to
town
,
my
sister
lead
the
way
in
a
very
large
beaver
bonnet
,
and
carry
a
basket
like
the
Great
Seal
of
England
in
plaited
straw
,
a
pair
of
patten
,
a
spare
shawl
,
and
an
umbrella
,
though
it
be
a
fine
bright
day
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
quite
clear
whether
these
article
be
carry
penitentially
or
ostentatiously
;
but
,
I
rather
think
they
be
display
as
article
of
property
---
much
as
Cleopatra
or
any
other
sovereign
lady
on
the
rampage
may
exhibit
her
wealth
in
a
pageant
or
procession
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
Pumblechook
's
,
my
sister
bounce
in
and
leave
us
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
almost
noon
,
Joe
and
I
hold
straight
on
to
Miss
Havisham
's
house
.
<EOS>
Estella
open
the
gate
as
usual
,
and
,
the
moment
she
appear
,
Joe
take
his
hat
off
and
stand
weigh
it
by
the
brim
in
both
his
hand
:
as
if
he
have
some
urgent
reason
in
his
mind
for
be
particular
to
half
a
quarter
of
an
ounce
.
  
<EOS>
Estella
take
no
notice
of
either
of
us
,
but
lead
us
the
way
that
I
know
so
well
.
<EOS>
I
follow
next
to
her
,
and
Joe
come
last
.
<EOS>
when
I
look
back
at
Joe
in
the
long
passage
,
he
be
still
weigh
his
hat
with
the
great
care
,
and
be
come
after
us
in
long
stride
on
the
tip
of
his
toe
.
  
<EOS>
Estella
tell
me
we
be
both
to
go
in
,
<EOS>
so
I
take
Joe
by
the
coat
-
cuff
and
conduct
him
into
Miss
Havisham
's
presence
.
<EOS>
She
be
seat
at
her
dressing
-
table
,
and
look
round
at
us
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
she
to
Joe
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
the
husband
of
the
sister
of
this
boy
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
have
imagine
dear
old
Joe
look
so
unlike
himself
or
so
like
some
extraordinary
bird
;
standing
,
as
he
do
,
speechless
,
with
his
tuft
of
feather
ruffle
,
and
his
mouth
open
,
as
if
he
want
a
worm
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
the
husband
,
"
repeat
Miss
Havisham
,
"
of
the
sister
of
this
boy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
aggravating
;
but
,
throughout
the
interview
Joe
persist
in
address
Me
instead
of
Miss
Havisham
.
  
<EOS>
"
which
I
meantersay
,
Pip
,
"
Joe
now
observe
in
a
manner
that
be
at
once
expressive
of
forcible
argumentation
,
strict
confidence
,
and
great
politeness
,
"
as
I
hup
and
marry
your
sister
,
and
I
be
at
the
time
what
you
may
call
(
if
you
be
anyways
incline
)
a
single
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
!
"
say
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
rear
the
boy
,
with
the
intention
of
take
him
for
your
apprentice
;
be
that
so
,
Mr
Gargery
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Pip
,
"
reply
Joe
,
"
as
you
and
me
be
ever
friend
,
and
it
be
look
for'ard

us
,
as

<EOS>
not
but
what

Pip
,
if
you
have
ever
make
objection
to
the
business
---
such
as
its
be

"
have
the
boy

say
Miss
Havisham
,
"
ever
make
any
objection

<EOS>
do
he
like
the
trade

"
  
"
<EOS>
which
it
be
well
beknown
to
yourself
,
Pip
,
"
return
Joe
,
strengthen
his
former
mixture
of
argumentation
,
confidence
,
and
politeness
,
"
that
it
be
the
wish
of
your
own
hart

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
(
I
see
the
idea
suddenly
break
upon
him
that
he
would
adapt
his
epitaph
to
the
occasion
,
before
he
go
on
to
say
)
"
<EOS>
and
there
be
not
no
objection
on
your
part
,
and
Pip
it
be
the
great
wish
of
your
hart
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
quite
in
vain
for
me
to
endeavour
to
make
him
sensible
that
he
ought
to
speak
to
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
make
face
and
gesture
to
him
to
do
it
,
the
more
confidential
,
argumentative
,
and
polite
,
he
persist
in
be
to
Me

<EOS>
"
have
you
bring
his
indenture
with
you

<EOS>
ask
Miss
Havisham
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
Pip
,
you
know
,
"
reply
Joe
,
<EOS>
as
if
that
be
a
little
unreasonable
,
"
you
yourself
see
me
put
'em
in
my

at

and
therefore
you

Miss

at

understand

well
than
I
have

take
up

convey
to
me
a

first
of

of
freezing

<EOS>
here
Joe
show
that
he
feel
he
have
fall
into
frightful
difficulty
,
until
he
triumphantly
rescue
himself
with
the
word
,
"
and
from
myself
far
be
it
!
"
<EOS>
these
word
have
such
a
round
and
convincing
sound
for
him
that
he
say
them
twice
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
-

say
Miss

out

!
<EOS>
one
word
!
"
  
<EOS>
thus
call
him
back
as
I
go
out
of
the
door
,
I
hear
her
say
to
Joe
,
in
a
distinct
emphatic
voice
,
"
the
boy
have
be
a
good
boy
here
,
and
that
be
his
reward
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
as
an
honest
man
,
you
will
expect
no
other
and
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
how
Joe
get
out
of
the
room
,
I
have
never
be
able
to
determine
;
but
,
I
know
that
when
he
do
get
out
he
be
steadily
proceed
up
-
stair
instead
of
come
down
,
and
be
deaf
to
all
remonstrance
until
I
go
after
him
and
lay
hold
of
him
.
<EOS>
in
another
minute
we
be
outside
the
gate
,
and
it
be
lock
,
and
Estella
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
stand
in
the
daylight
alone
again
,
Joe
back
up
against
a
wall
,
and
say
to
me
,
"
astonish
!
"
<EOS>
and
there
he
remain
so
long
,
say
"
astonish
"
at
interval
,
so
often
,
that
I
begin
to
think
his
sense
be
never
come
back
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
prolong
his
remark
into
"
Pip
,
I
do
assure
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
this
be
as

"
<EOS>
and
so
,
by
degree
,
become
conversational
and
able
to
walk
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
think
that
Joe
's
intellect
be
brighten
by
the
encounter
they
have
pass
through
,
and
that
on
our
way
to
Pumblechook
's
he
invent
a
subtle
and
deep
design
.
<EOS>
My
reason
be
to
be
find
in
what
take
place
in
Mr
Pumblechook
's
parlour
:
where
,
on
our
present
ourselves
,
my
sister
sit
in
conference
with
that
detest
seedsman
.
  
<EOS>
"

cry
my

address
us
both
at
once

<EOS>
and
what
be
happen
to
you
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
condescend
to
come
back
to
such
poor
society
as
this
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
I
do
!

there
my

become
so
excited
by
the
twenty

five
guinea

that
nothing
would
serve
her
<EOS>
but
we
must
have
a
dinner
out
of

windfall

at

go
over

It
be
agree
to
be
do

a
most
melancholy
day
I
pass
.
<EOS>
for
,
it
inscrutably
appear
to
stand
to
reason
,
in
the
mind
of
the
whole
company
,
that
I
be
an
excrescence
on
the
entertainment
.
<EOS>
and
to
make
it
bad
,
they
all
ask
me
from
time
to
time
---
in
short
,
whenever
they
have
nothing
else
to
do
---
why
I
do
not
enjoy
myself

and
what
could
I
possibly
do
then
,
but
say
I
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
be
\
 
<EOS>
enjoy
myself
---
when
I
be
not
?
  
<EOS>
however
,
they
be
grow
up
and
have
their
own
way
,
and
they
make
the
most
of
it

<EOS>
that
swindle
Pumblechook

exalt
into

fiendishly
congratulate

on
my
be
liable

play
at

drank
strong
liquor

keep
late
hour

indulge
in
other
vagary
which
the
form
of

appear
to
contemplate
as
next

he
place
me
stand
on
a
chair
beside
him

to
illustrate
his
remark

<EOS>
My
only
other
remembrance
of
the
great
festival
be
,
that
they
would
not
let
me
go
to
sleep
,
but
whenever
they
see
me
drop
off
,
wake
me
up
and
tell
me
to
enjoy
myself

rather
late

give
us
Collins
's
ode
,
and
throw
his
blood
-
stain'd
sword
in
thunder
down
,
with
such
effect
,
that
a
waiter
come
in
and
say
"
the
Commercials
underneath
send
up
their
compliment
,
and
it
be
not
the
tumbler
'
arm
.
<EOS>
"
that
,
they
be
all
in
excellent
spirit
on
the
road
home
,
and
sing
O
Lady
Fair
!
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
take
the
bass
,
and
assert
with
a
tremendously
strong
voice
(
in
reply
to
the
inquisitive
bore
who
lead
that
piece
of
music
in
a
most
impertinent
manner
,
by
want
to
know
all
about
everybody
's
private
affair
)
that
 
\
<EOS>
he
\
 
<EOS>
be
the
man
with
his
white
lock
flow
,
and
that
he
be
upon
the
whole
the
weak
pilgrim
go
.
  
<EOS>
finally
,
I
remember
that
when
I
get
into
my
little
bedroom
<EOS>
I
be
truly
wretched
,
and
have
a
strong
conviction
on
me
that
I
should
never
like
Joe
's
trade
.
<EOS>
I
have
like
it
once
,
but
once
be
not
now
.
    
<EOS>
chapter
14
 
it
be
a
most
miserable
thing
to
feel
ashamed
of
home
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
black
ingratitude
in
the
thing
,
and
the
punishment
may
be
retributive
and
well
deserved
;
but
,
that
it
be
a
miserable
thing
,
I
can
testify
.
  
<EOS>
home
have
never
be
a
very
pleasant
place
to
me
,
because
of
my
sister
's
temper
.
<EOS>
but
,
Joe
have
sanctify
it
,
and
I
have
believe
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
believe
in
the
good
parlour
as
a
most
elegant
saloon
;
I
have
believe
in
the
front
door
,
as
a
mysterious
portal
of
the
Temple
of
State
whose
solemn
opening
be
attend
with
a
sacrifice
of
roast
fowl
;
I
have
believe
in
the
kitchen
as
a
chaste
though
not
magnificent
apartment
;
I
have
believe
in
the
forge
as
the
glowing
road
to
manhood
and
independence
.
<EOS>
within
a
single
year
,
all
this
be
change
.
<EOS>
now
,
it
be
all
coarse
and
common
,
and
I
would
not
have
have
<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
see
it
on
any
account
.
  
<EOS>
how
much
of
my
ungracious
condition
of
mind
may
have
be
my
own
fault
,
<EOS>
how
much
Miss
Havisham
's
,
how
much
my
sister
's
,
be
now
of
no
moment
to
me
or
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
the
change
be
make
in
me
;
the
thing
be
do
.
<EOS>
well
or
ill
do
,
excusably
or
inexcusably
,
it
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
once
it
have
seem
to
me
that
when
I
should
at
last
roll
up
my
shirt
-
sleeve
and
go
into
the
forge
,
Joe
's
'
prentice
,
I
should
be
distinguished
and
happy
.
<EOS>
now
the
reality
be
in
my
hold
,
I
only
feel
that
I
be
dusty
with
the
dust
of
small
coal
,
and
that
I
have
a
weight
upon
my
daily
remembrance
to
which
the
anvil
be
a
feather
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
occasion
in
my
later
life
(
I
suppose
as
in
most
life
)
when
I
have
feel
for
a
time
as
if
a
thick
curtain
have
fall
on
all
its
interest
and
romance
,
to
shut
me
out
from
anything
save
dull
endurance
any
more
.
<EOS>
never
have
that
curtain
drop
so
heavy
and
blank
,
as
when
my
way
in
life
lie
stretch
out
straight
before
me
through
the
newly
-
enter
road
of
apprenticeship
to
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
that
at
a
later
period
of
my
"
time
,
"
I
use
to
stand
about
the
churchyard
on
Sunday
evening
when
night
be
fall
,
compare
my
own
perspective
with
the
windy
marsh
view
,
and
make
out
some
likeness
between
them
by
think
how
flat
and
low
both
be
,
and
how
on
both
there
come
an
unknown
way
and
a
dark
mist
and
then
the
sea
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
as
deject
on
the
first
working
-
day
of
my
apprenticeship
as
in
that
after
-
time
;
but
I
be
glad
to
know
that
I
never
breathe
a
murmur
to
Joe
while
my
indenture
last
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
the
only
thing
I
 
\
<EOS>
be
<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
glad
to
know
of
myself
in
that
connection
.
  
<EOS>
for
,
though
it
include
what
I
proceed
to
add
,
all
the
merit
of
what
I
proceed
to
add
be
Joe
's
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
because
I
be
faithful
,
but
because
Joe
be
faithful
,
that
I
never
run
away
and
go
for
a
soldier
or
a
sailor
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
because
I
have
a
strong
sense
of
the
virtue
of
industry
,
but
because
Joe
have
a
strong
sense
of
the
virtue
of
industry
,
that
I
work
with
tolerable
zeal
against
the
grain
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
possible
to
know
how
far
the
influence
of
any
amiable
honest
-
head
duty
-
do
man
fly
out
into
the
world
;
but
it
be
very
possible
to
know
how
it
have
touch
one
's
self
in
go
by
,
and
I
know
right
well
,
that
any
good
that
intermix
itself
with
my
apprenticeship
come
of
plain
contented
Joe
,
and
not
of
restlessly
aspire
discontent
me
.
  
<EOS>
what
I
want
,
who
can
say
?
<EOS>
how
can
I
say
,
when
I
never
know
?
<EOS>
what
I
dread
be
,
that
in
some
unlucky
hour
I
,
be
at
my
grimi
and
common
,
should
lift
up
my
eye
and
see
Estella
look
in
at
one
of
the
wooden
window
of
the
forge
.
<EOS>
I
be
haunt
by
the
fear
that
she
would
,
sooner
or
later
,
find
me
out
,
with
a
black
face
and
hand
,
do
the
coarse
part
of
my
work
,
and
would
exult
over
me
and
despise
me
.
<EOS>
often
after
dark
,
when
I
be
pull
the
bellow
for
Joe
,
and
we
be
singe
Old
Clem
,
and
when
the
thought
how
we
use
to
sing
it
at
Miss
Havisham
's
would
seem
to
show
me
Estella
's
face
in
the
fire
,
with
her
pretty
hair
flutter
in
the
wind
and
her
eye
scorn
me
,
---
often
at
such
a
time
I
would
look
towards
those
panel
of
black
night
in
the
wall
which
the
wooden
window
then
be
,
and
would
fancy
that
I
see
her
just
draw
her
face
away
,
and
would
believe
that
she
have
come
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
,
when
we
go
in
to
supper
,
the
place
and
the
meal
would
have
a
more
homely
look
than
ever
,
and
I
would
feel
more
ashamed
of
home
than
ever
,
in
my
own
ungracious
breast
.

<EOS>
as
I
be
get
too
big
for
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
's

,
my
education
under
that
preposterous
female
terminate

<EOS>
not

however
,
until
Biddy
have
impart
to
me
everything
she
know
,
from
the
little
catalogue
of
price
,
to
a
comic
song
she
have
once
buy
for
a
halfpenny

<EOS>
although
the
only
coherent
part

the
latter
piece

be
the
opening

---
still
,
in
my
desire
to
be
wise
,
I
get
this
composition
by
heart
with
the
utmost
gravity
;
nor
do
I
recollect
that
I
question
its
merit
,
except
that
I
think
(
as
I
still
do
)
<EOS>
the
amount
of
Too
rul
somewhat
in
excess
of
the
poetry
.
<EOS>
in
my
hunger
for
information
,
I
make
proposal
to
Mr
Wopsle
to
bestow
some
intellectual
crumb
upon
me
;
with
which
he
kindly
comply
.
<EOS>
as
it
turn
out
,
however
,
that
he
only
want
me
for
a
dramatic
lay
-
figure
,
to
be
contradict
and
embrace
and
weep
over
and
bully
and
clutch
and
stab
and
knock
about
in
a
variety
of
way
,
I
soon
decline
that
course
of
instruction
;
though
not
until
Mr
Wopsle
in
his
poetic
fury
have
severely
maul
me
.
  
<EOS>
whatever
I
acquire
,
I
try
to
impart
to
Joe
.
<EOS>
this
statement
sound
so
well
,
that
I
can
not
in
my
conscience
let
it
pass
unexplained
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
make
Joe
less
ignorant
and
common
,
that
he
may
be
worthy
of
my
society
and
less
open
to
Estella
's
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
Battery
out
on
the
marsh
be
our
place
of
study
,
and
a
broken
slate
and
a
short
piece
of
alate
pencil
be
our
educational
implement
:
to
which
Joe
always
add
a
pipe
of
tobacco
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
Joe
to
remember
anything
from
one
Sunday
to
another
,
or
to
acquire
,
under
my
tuition
,
any
piece
of
information
whatever
.
<EOS>
yet
he
would
smoke
his
pipe
at
the
Battery
with
a
fur
more
sagacious
air
than
anywhere
else
---
even
with
a
learned
air
---
as
if
he
consider
himself
to
be
advance
immensely
.
<EOS>
dear
fellow
,
I
hope
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
and
quiet
,
out
there
with
the
sail
on
the
river
pass
beyond
the
earthwork
,
and
sometimes
,
when
the
tide
be
low
,
look
as
if
they
belong
to
sunken
ship
that
be
still
sail
on
at
the
bottom
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
whenever
I
watch
the
vessel
stand
out
to
sea
with
their
white
sail
spread
,
I
somehow
think
of
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
;
and
whenever
the
light
strike
aslant
,
afar
off
,
upon
a
cloud
or
sail
or
green
hill
-
side
or
water
-
line
,
it
be
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
and
the
strange
house
and
the
strange
life
appear
to
have
something
to
do
with
everything
that
be
picturesque
.
  
<EOS>
one
Sunday
when
Joe
,
greatly
enjoy
his
pipe
,
have
so
plume
himself
on
be
"
most
awful
dull
,
"
that
I
have
give
him
up
for
the
day
,
I
lie
on
the
earthwork
for
some
time
with
my
chin
on
my
hand
,
descry
trace
of
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
all
over
the
prospect
,
in
the
sky
and
in
the
water
,
until
at
last
I
resolve
to
mention
a
thought
concern
them
that
have
be
much
in
my
head

<EOS>
"
Joe

I

<EOS>

return
Joe

<EOS>
"
what
for

there

"
as
for

the

<EOS>

in

she
may
credit
it

<EOS>
similarly
she
might
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Joe
feel
,
as
I
do
,
that
he
have
make
a
point
there
,
and
he
pull
hard
at
his
pipe
to
keep
himself
from
weaken
it
by
repetition
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Pip
,
"
Joe
pursue
,
as
soon
as
he
be
past
that
danger
,
"
Miss

<EOS>
when
Miss
Havisham
do
the
handsome

by

,
she
call
me
back
to
say
to
me
as

<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
I

all

very
emphatically

<EOS>
"

I
tell
you

which
I

it
may
be
that

I
have
think
of
that
too
,
and
it
be
very
far
from
comfort
to
me
to
find
that
he
have
think
of

for
it

"
  
"
My
dear
Joe
,
"
I
cry
,
in
desperation
,
take
hold
of
his
coat
,
"
do
not
go
on
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
never
think
of
make
Miss
Havisham
any
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Pip
,
"
Joe
assent
,
as
if
he
have
be
contend
for
that
,
all
along
;
"
and
what
I
say
to
you
be
,
you
be
right
,
Pip
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Joe
;
but
what
I
want
to
say
,
be
,
that
as
we
be
rather
slack
just
now
,
if
you
would
give
me
a
half
-
holiday
to
-
morrow
,
I
think
I
would
go
up
-
town
and
make
a
call
on
Miss
est---
Havisham
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
which
her
name
,
"
say
Joe
,
gravely
,
"
be
not
Estavisham
,
Pip
,
unless
she
have
be
rechris'ene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
Joe
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
slip
of
mine
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
it
,
Joe
?
"
  
<EOS>
in
brief
,
Joe
think
that
if
I
think
well
of
it
,
he
think
well
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
he
be
particular
in
stipulate
that
if
I
be
not
receive
with
cordiality
,
or
if
I
be
not
encourage
to
repeat
my
visit
as
a
visit
which
have
no
ulterior
object
but
be
simply
one
of
gratitude
for
a
favour
receive
,
then
this
experimental
trip
should
have
no
successor
.
<EOS>
by
these
condition
I
promise
to
abide
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Joe
keep
a
journeyman
at
weekly
wage
whose
name
be
Orlick
.
<EOS>
He
pretend
that
his
christian
name
be
Dolge
---
a
clear
impossibility
---
but
he
be
a
fellow
of
that
obstinate
disposition
that
I
believe
him
to
have
be
the
prey
of
no
delusion
in
this
particular
,
but
wilfully
to
have
impose
that
name
upon
the
village
as
an
affront
to
its
understanding
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
broad
-
shoulder
loose
-
limbed
swarthy
fellow
of
great
strength
,
never
in
a
hurry
,
and
always
slouch
.
<EOS>
He
never
even
seem
to
come
to
his
work
on
purpose
,
but
would
slouch
in
as
if
by
mere
accident
;
and
when
he
go
to
the
Jolly
Bargemen
to
eat
his
dinner
,
or
go
away
at
night
,
he
would
slouch
out
,
like
Cain
or
the
Wandering
Jew
as
if
he
have
no
idea
where
he
be
go
and
no
intention
of
ever
come
back
.
<EOS>
He
lodge
at
a
sluice
-
keeper
be
out
on
the
marsh
,
and
on
work
day
would
come
slouch
from
his
hermitage
,
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
his
dinner
loosely
tie
in
a
bundle
<EOS>
round
his
neck
and
dangle
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
on
Sundays
he
mostly
lie
all
day
on
sluice
-
gate
,
or
stand
against
rick
and
barn
.
<EOS>
He
always
slouch
,
locomotively
,
with
his
eye
on
the
ground
;
and
,
when
accost
or
otherwise
require
to
raise
them
,
he
look
up
in
a
half
resentful
,
half
puzzled
way
,
as
though
the
only
thought
he
ever
have
,
be
,
that
it
be
rather
an
odd
and
injurious
fact
that
he
should
never
be
think
.
  
<EOS>
this
morose
journeyman
have
no
like
for
me
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
very
small
and
timid
,
he
give
me
to
understand
that
the
Devil
live
in
a
black
corner
of
the
forge
,
and
that
he
know
the
fiend
very
well
:
also
that
it
be
necessary
to
make
up
the
fire
,
once
in
seven
year
,
with
a
live
boy
,
and
that
I
may
consider
myself
fuel
.
<EOS>
when
I
become
Joe
's
'
prentice
,
Orlick
be
perhaps
confirm
in
some
suspicion
that
I
should
displace
him
;
howbeit
,
he
like
me
still
less
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
ever
say
anything
,
or
do
anything
,
openly
import
hostility
;
I
only
notice
that
he
always
beat
his
spark
in
my
direction
,
and
that
whenever
I
sing
Old
Clem
,
he
come
in
out
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
Dolge
Orlick
be
at
work
and
present
,
next
day
,
when
I
remind
Joe
of
my
half
-
holiday
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
at
the
moment
,
for
he
and
Joe
have
just
get
a
piece
of
hot
iron
between
them
,
and
I
be
at
the
bellow
;
but
by
-
and
-
by
he
say
,
lean
on
his
hammer
:
  
"

<EOS>
sure

he
usually

<EOS>
"

the

refuse
to
entertain
the
subject
until
the
journeyman
be
in

well

Orlick
plunge

gruff
Old

<EOS>
My

be

silent
in
the
yard

within
hearing

she

unscrupulous

each
of
these
exclamation
be
a
shriek

I
must
remark
of
my
sister

what
be
equally
true
of
all
the
violent
woman
I
have
ever
see
,
that
passion
be
no
excuse
for
her
,
because
it
be
undeniable
that
instead
of
lapse
into
passion
,
she
consciously
and
deliberately
take
extraordinary
pain
to
force
herself
into
it
,
and
become
blindly
furious
by
regular
stage
;
"
what
be
the
name
he
give
me

the

the

between
his

I

I
would
hold
you
under

choke
it
out

(

I
tell

my

a
clap

together

which
be
her
next
stage
.

<EOS>
here
my
sister
,
after
a
fit
of
clapping
and
screaming
,
beat
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
and
upon
her
knee
,
and
throw
her
cap
off
,
and
pull
her
hair
down
---
which
be
the
last
stage
on
her
road
to
frenzy
.
<EOS>
be
by
this
time
a
perfect
fury
and
a
complete
success
,
she
make
a
dash
at
the
door
,
which
I
have
fortunately
lock
.
  
<EOS>
what
could
the
wretched
Joe
do
now
,
after
his
disregard
parenthetical
interruption
,
but
stand
up
to
his
journeyman
,
and
ask
him
what
he
mean
by
interfere
betwixt
himself
and
Mrs
Joe
;
and
further
whether
he
be
man
enough
to
come
on
?
<EOS>
Old
Orlick
feel
that
the
situation
admit
of
nothing
less
than
come
on
,
and
be
on
his
defence
straightway
;
<EOS>
so
,
without
so
much
as
pull
off
their
singed
and
burn
apron
,
they
go
at
one
another
,
like
two
giant
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
any
man
in
that
neighbourhood
could
stand
up
long
against
Joe
,
I
never
see
the
man
.
<EOS>
Orlick
,
as
if
he
have
be
of
no
more
account
than
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
be
very
soon
among
the
coal
-
dust
,
and
in
no
hurry
to
come
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
then
,
Joe
unlock
the
door
and
pick
up
my
sister
,
who
have
drop
insensible
at
the
window
(
but
who
have
see
the
fight
first
,
I
think
)
,
and
who
be
carry
into
the
house
and
lay
down
,
and
who
be
recommend
to
revive
,
and
would
do
nothing
but
struggle
and
clench
her
hand
in
Joe
's
hair
.
<EOS>
then
,
come
that
singular
calm
and
silence
which
succeed
all
uproar
;
and
then
,
with
the
vague
sensation
which
I
have
always
connect
with
such
a
lull
---
namely
,
that
it
be
Sunday
,
and
somebody
be
dead
<EOS>
---
I
go
up
-
stair
to
dress
myself
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
down
again
,
I
find
Joe
and
Orlick
sweep
up
,
without
any
other
trace
of
discomposure
than
a
slit
in
one
of
Orlick
's
nostril
,
which
be
neither
expressive
nor
ornamental
.
<EOS>
a
pot
of
beer
have
appear
from
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
and
they
be
share
it
by
turn
in
a
peaceable
manner
.
<EOS>
the
lull
have
a
sedative
and
philosophical
influence
on
Joe
,
who
follow
me
out
into
the
road
to
say
,
as
a
parting
observation
that
may
do
me
good
,
"
on
the
rampage
,
Pip
,
and
off
the
rampage
,
Pip
---
such
be
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
with
what
absurd
emotion
(
for
,
we
think
the
feeling
that
be
very
serious
in
a
man
quite
comical
in
a
boy
)
<EOS>
I
find
myself
again
go
to
Miss
Havisham
's
,
matter
little
here
.
<EOS>
nor
,
how
I
pass
and
repasse
the
gate
many
time
before
I
could
make
up
my
mind
to
ring
.
<EOS>
nor
,
how
I
debate
whether
I
should
go
away
without
ring
;
nor
,
how
I
should
undoubtedly
have
go
,
if
my
time
have
be
my
own
,
to
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Sarah
Pocket
come
to
the
gate

<EOS>
no
Estella

<EOS>
"
how
,
then
?
<EOS>
You
here
again
?
"
say
Miss
Pocket
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
I
say
that
I
only
come
to
see
how
Miss
Havisham
be
,
Sarah
evidently
deliberate
whether
or
no
she
should
send
me
about
my
business
.
<EOS>
but
,
unwilling
to
hazard
the
responsibility
,
she
let
me
in
,
and
presently
bring
the
sharp
message
that
I
be
to
"
come
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
everything
be
unchanged
,
and
Miss
Havisham
be
alone
.
"
<EOS>
well
?
"
say
she
,
fix
her
eye
upon
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
want
nothing
?
<EOS>
You
will

<EOS>
I
only
want
you

she
cry
suddenly
turn
herself
and
her
chair
towards
me
,
"
You

<EOS>
hey

<EOS>
"
  
I
have

I

that
I
hope
she
be
well

say
Miss
Havisham
;
"
educate
for
a
lady
;
far
out
of

;
pretty
than
ever
;
admire
by
all
who
see
her
.
<EOS>
do
you
feel
that
you
have
lose
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
malignant
enjoyment
in
her
utterance
of
the
last
word
,
and
she
break
into
such
a
disagreeable
laugh
,
that
I
be
at
a
loss
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
spare
me
the
trouble
of
considering
,
by
dismiss
me
.
<EOS>
when
the
gate
be
close
upon
me
by
Sarah
of
the
walnut
-
shell
countenance
,
I
feel
more
than
ever
dissatisfy
with
my
home
and
with
my
trade
and
with
everything
;
and
that
be
all
I
take
by
 
\
<EOS>
that
\
 
<EOS>
motion
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
be
loiter
along
the
high
-
street
,
look
in
disconsolately
at
the
shop
window
,
and
think
what
I
would
buy
if
I
be
a
gentleman
,
who
should
come
out
of
the
bookshop
but
Mr
Wopsle
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
have
in
his
hand
the
affect
tragedy
of
George
Barnwell
,
in
which
he
have
that
moment
invest
sixpence
,
with
the
view
of
heap
every
word
of
it
on
the
head
of
Pumblechook
,
with
whom
he
be
go
to
drink
tea
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
he
see
me
,
than
he
appear
to
consider
that
a
special
Providence
have
put
a
'
prentice
in
his
way
to
be
read
at
;
and
he
lay
hold
of
me
,
and
insist
on
my
accompany
him
to
the
Pumblechookian
parlour
.
<EOS>
as
I
know
it
would
be
miserable
at
home
,
and
as
the
night
be
dark
and
the
way
be
dreary
,
and
almost
any
companionship
on
the
road
be
well
than
none
,
I
make
no
great
resistance
;
consequently
,
we
turn
into
Pumblechook
's
just
as
the
street
and
the
shop
be
light
up
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
never
assist
at
any
other
representation
of
George
Barnwell
,
I
do
not
know
how
long
it
may
usually
take
;
but
I
know
very
well
that
it
take
until
half
-
past
nine
o'clock
that
night
,
and
that
when
Mr
Wopsle
get
into
Newgate
,
I
think
he
never
would
go
to
the
scaffold
,
he
become
so
much
slow
than
at
any
former
period
of
his
disgraceful
career
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
a
little
too
much
that
he
should
complain
of
be
cut
short
in
his
flower
after
all
,
as
if
he
have
not
be
run
to
seed
,
leaf
after
leaf
,
ever
since
his
course
begin
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
a
mere
question
of
length
and
wearisomeness
.
<EOS>
what
sting
me
,
be
the
identification
of
the
whole
affair
with
my
unoffending
self
.
<EOS>
when
Barnwell
begin
to
go
wrong
,
I
declare
that
I
feel
positively
apologetic
,
Pumblechook
's
indignant
stare
<EOS>
so
tax
me
with
it
.
<EOS>
wopsle
,
too
,
take
pain
to
present
me
in
the
bad
light
.
<EOS>
at
once
ferocious
and
maudlin
,
I
be
make
to
murder
my
uncle
with
no
extenuate
circumstance
whatever
;
Millwood
put
me
down
in
argument
,
on
every
occasion
;
it
become
sheer
monomania
in
my
master
's
daughter
to
care
a
button
for
me
;
and
all
I
can
say
for
my
gasping
and
procrastinate
conduct
on
the
fatal
morning
,
be
,
that
it
be
worthy
of
the
general
feebleness
of
my
character
.
<EOS>
even
after
I
be
happily
hang
and
Wopsle
have
close
the
book
<EOS>
,
Pumblechook
sit
stare
at
me
,
and
shake
his
head
,
and
say
,
"
take
warning
,
boy
,
take
warning
!
"
<EOS>
as
if
it
be
a
well
-
know
fact
that
I
contemplate
murder
a
near
relation
,
provide
I
could
only
induce
one
to
have
the
weakness
to
become
my
benefactor
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
dark
night
when
it
be
all
over
,
and
when
I
set
out
with
Mr
Wopsle
on
the
walk
home
.
<EOS>
beyond
town
,
we
find
a
heavy
mist
out
,
and
it
fall
wet
and
thick
.
<EOS>
the
turnpike
lamp
be
a
blur
,
quite
out
of
the
lamp
's
usual
place
apparently
,
and
its
ray
look
solid
substance
on
the
fog
.
<EOS>
We
be
notice
this
,
and
say
how
that
the
mist
rise
with
a
change
of
wind
from
a
certain
quarter
of
our
marsh
,
when
we
come
upon
a
man
,
slouch
under
the
lee
of
the
turnpike
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
<EOS>
"
we
say
,
stop
.
<EOS>
"
Orlick
,
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
answer
,
slouch
out
.
<EOS>
"
I
be

by

a
minute
,
on
the
chance
of
company

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
late
,
"
I
remark
.
  
<EOS>
Orlick
not
unnaturally
answer
,
"
well
?
<EOS>
and
you
be
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
be

"
say
Mr
Wopsle
,
exalt
with
his
late
performance
,
"
we
have
be
indulge
,
Mr
Orlick
,
in
an
intellectual
evening
.
"
  
<EOS>
Old
Orlick
growl
,
as
if
he
have
nothing
to
say
about
that
,
and
we
all
go
on
together
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
presently
whether
he
have
be
spend
his
half
-
holiday
up
and
down
town
?
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
,
"
all
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
come
in
behind
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
you
,
but
I
must
have
be
pretty
close
behind
you
.
<EOS>
by

the

bye
,
the
gun
be
go
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
at
the
Hulks
?
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
!
<EOS>
there
be
some
of
the
bird
fly
from
the
cage
.
<EOS>
the
gun
have
be
go
since
dark
,
about
.
<EOS>
You
will
hear
one
presently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
effect
,
we
have
not
walk
many
yard
further
,
when
the
well
-
remember
boom
come
towards
us
,
deaden
by
the
mist
,
and
heavily
roll
away
along
the
low
ground
by
the
river
,
as
if
it
be
pursue
and
threaten
the
fugitive
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
good
night
for
cut
off
in
,
"
say
Orlick
.
<EOS>
"
We
would
be
puzzle
how
to
bring
down
a
jail
-
bird
on
the
wing
,
to
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
subject
be
a
suggestive
one
to
me
,
and
I
think
about
it
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
,
as
the
ill
-
requite
uncle
of
the
evening
's
tragedy
,
fall
to
meditate
aloud
in
his
garden
at
Camberwell
.
<EOS>
Orlick
,
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
slouch
heavily
at
my
side
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
dark
,
very
wet
,
very
muddy
,
and
so
we
splash
along
.
<EOS>
now
and
then
,
the
sound
of
the
signal
cannon
break
upon
us
again
,
and
again
roll
sulkily
along
the
course
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
I
keep
myself
to
myself
and
my
thought
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
die
amiably
at
Camberwell
,
and
exceedingly
game
on
Bosworth
Field
,
and
in
the
great
agony
at
Glastonbury
.
 
<EOS>
Orlick
sometimes
growl
,
"
beat
it
out
<EOS>
beat
it
out
---
Old
Clem
!
<EOS>
with
a
clink
for
the
stout
---
Old
Clem
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
think
he
have
be
drink
,
but
he
be
not
drunk
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
we
come
to
the
village
.
<EOS>
the
way
by
which
we
approach
it
,
take
us
past
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
,
which
we
be
surprised
to
find
---
it
be
eleven
o'clock
---
in
a
state
of
commotion
,
with
the
door
wide
open
,
and
unwonted
light
that
have
be
hastily
catch
up
and
put
down
,
scatter
about
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
drop
in
to
ask
what
be
the
matter
(
surmise
that
a
convict
have
be
take
)
,
but
come
run
out
in
a
great
hurry
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
wrong
,
"
say
he
,
without
stop
,
"
up
at
your
place
,
Pip
.
<EOS>
run
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
keep
up
with
him
.
<EOS>
so
do
Orlick
,
at
my
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
quite
understand
.
<EOS>
the
house
seem
to
have
be
violently
enter
when
Joe
Gargery
be
out
.
<EOS>
suppose
by
convict
.
<EOS>
somebody
have
be
attack
and
hurt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
be
run
too
fast
to
admit
of
more
be
say
,
and
we
make
no
stop
until
we
get
into
our
kitchen
.
<EOS>
It
be
full
of
people
;
the
whole
village
be
there
,
or
in
the
yard
;
and
there
be
a
surgeon
,
and
there
be
Joe
,
and
there
be
a
group
of
woman
,
all
on
the
floor
in
the
midst
of
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
the
unemployed
bystander
draw
back
when
they
see
me
,
and
so
I
become
aware
of
my
sister
---
lie
without
sense
or
movement
on
the
bare
board
where
she
have
be
knock
down
by
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
back
of
the
head
,
deal
by
some
unknown
hand
when
her
face
be
turn
towards
the
fire
---
destine
never
to
be
on
the
rampage
again
,
while
she
be
the
wife
of
Joe

<EOS>
chapter
16
 
with
my
head
full
of
George
Barnwell
<EOS>
,
I
be
at
first
dispose
to
believe
that
I
must
have
have
some
hand
in
the
attack
upon
my
sister
,
or
at
all
event
that
as
her
near
relation
,
popularly
know
to
be
under
obligation
to
her
,
I
be
a
more
legitimate
object
of
suspicion
than
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
but
when
,
in
the
clear
light
of
next
morning
,
I
begin
to
reconsider
the
matter
and
to
hear
it
discuss
around
me
on
all
side
,
I
take
another
view
of
the
case
,
which
be
more
reasonable
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
have
be
at
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
,
smoke
his
pipe
,
from
a
quarter
after
eight
o'clock
to
a
quarter
before
ten
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
there
,
my
sister
have
be
see
stand
at
the
kitchen
door
,
and
have
exchange
Good
Night
with
a
farm
-
labourer
go
home
.
<EOS>
the
man
could
not
be
more
particular
as
to
the
time
at
which
he
see
her
<EOS>
(
he
get
into
dense
confusion
when
he
try
to
be
)
,
than
that
it
must
have
be
before
nine
.
<EOS>
when
Joe
go
home
at
five
minute
before
ten
,
he
find
her
strike
down
on
the
floor
,
and
promptly
call
in
assistance
.
<EOS>
the
fire
have
not
then
burn
unusually
low
,
nor
be
the
snuff
of
the
candle
very
long
;
the
candle
,
however
,
have
be
blow
out
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
take
away
from
any
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
neither
,
beyond
the
blowing
out
of
the
candle
---
which
stand
on
a
table
between
the
door
and
my
sister
,
and
be
behind
her
when
she
stand
face
the
fire
and
be
strike
---
be
there
any
disarrangement
of
the
kitchen
,
except
such
as
she
herself
have
make
,
in
fall
and
bleed
.
<EOS>
but
,
there
be
one
remarkable
piece
of
evidence
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
strike
with
something
blunt
and
heavy
,
on
the
head
and
spine
;
after
the
blow
be
deal
,
something
heavy
have
be
throw
down
at
her
with
considerable
violence
,
as
she
lie
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
and
on
the
ground
beside
her
,
when
Joe
pick
her
up
,
be
a
convict
's
leg
-
iron
which
have
be
file
asunder
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Joe
,
examine
this
iron
with
a
smith
's
eye
,
declare
it
to
have
be
file
asunder
some
time
ago
.
<EOS>
the
hue
and
cry
go
off
to
the
Hulks
,
and
people
come
thence
to
examine
the
iron
,
Joe
's
opinion
be
corroborate
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
undertake
to
say
when
it
have
leave
the
prison
-
ship
to
which
it
undoubtedly
have
once
belong
;
but
they
claim
to
know
for
certain
that
that
particular
manacle
have
not
be
wear
by
either
of
two
convict
who
have
escape
last
night
.
<EOS>
further
,
one
of
those
two
be
already
re
-
take
,
and
have
not
free
himself
of
his
iron
.
  
<EOS>
know
what
I
know
,
I
set
up
an
inference
of
my
own
here
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
iron
to
be
my
convict
's
iron
---
the
iron
I
have
see
and
hear
him
file
at
,
on
the
marsh
---
but
my
mind
do
not
accuse
him
of
have
put
it
to
its
late
use
.
<EOS>
for
,
I
believe
one
of
two
other
person
to
have
become
possessed
of
it
,
and
to
have
turn
it
to
this
cruel
account
.
<EOS>
either
Orlick
,
or
the
strange
man
who
have
show
me
the
file
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
as
to
Orlick
;
he
have
go
to
town
exactly
as
he
tell
us
when
we
pick
him
up
at
the
turnpike
,
he
have
be
see
about
town
all
the
evening
,
he
have
be
in
diver
company
in
several
public
-
house
,
and
he
have
come
back
with
myself
and
Mr
Wopsle
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
against
him
,
save
the
quarrel
;
and
my
sister
have
quarrel
with
him
,
and
with
everybody
else
about
her
,
ten
thousand
time
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
strange
man
;
if
he
have
come
back
for
his
two
bank
-
note
there
could
have
be
no
dispute
about
them
,
because
my
sister
be
fully
prepared
to
restore
them
.
<EOS>
besides
,
there
have
be
no
altercation
;
the
assailant
have
come
in
so
silently
and
suddenly
,
that
she
have
be
fell
before
she
could
look
round
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
horrible
to
think
that
I
have
provide
the
weapon
,
however
undesignedly
,
but
I
could
hardly
think
otherwise
.
<EOS>
I
suffer
unspeakable
trouble
while
I
consider
and
reconsider
whether
I
should
at
last
dissolve
that
spell
of
my
childhood
,
and
tell
Joe
all
the
story
.
<EOS>
for
month
afterwards
,
I
every
day
settle
the
question
finally
in
the
negative
,
and
reopen
and
reargue
it
next
morning
.
<EOS>
the
contention
come
,
after
all
,
to
this
;
---
the
secret
be
such
an
old
one
now
,
have
so
grow
into
me
and
become
a
part
of
myself
,
that
I
could
not
tear
it
away
.
<EOS>
in
addition
to
the
dread
that
,
have
lead
up
to
so
much
mischief
,
it
would
be
now
more
likely
than
ever
to
alienate
Joe
from
me
if
he
believe
it
,
I
have
a
further
restraining
dread
that
he
would
not
believe
it
,
but
would
assort
it
with
the
fabulous
dog
and
veal
-
cutlet
as
a
monstrous
invention
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
temporize
with
myself
,
of
course
---
for
,
be
I
not
waver
between
right
and
wrong
,
when
the
thing
be
always
do
?
---
and
resolve
to
make
a
full
disclosure
if
I
should
see
any
such
new
occasion
as
a
new
chance
of
help
in
the
discovery
of
the
assailant
.
  
<EOS>
the
Constables
,
and
the
Bow
Street
man
from
London
---
for
,
this
happen
in
the
day
of
the
extinct
red
-
waistcoate
police
---
be
about
the
house
for
a
week
or
two
,
and
do
pretty
much
what
I
have
hear
and
read
of
like
authority
do
in
other
such
case
.
<EOS>
They
take
up
several
obviously
wrong
people
,
and
they
run
their
head
very
hard
against
wrong
idea
,
and
persist
in
try
to
fit
the
circumstance
to
the
idea
,
instead
of
try
to
extract
idea
from
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
also
,
they
stand
about
the
door
of
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
with
know
and
reserve
look
that
fill
the
whole
neighbourhood
with
admiration
;
and
they
have
a
mysterious
manner
of
take
their
drink
,
that
be
almost
as
good
as
take
the
culprit
.
<EOS>
but
not
quite
,
for
they
never
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
long
after
these
constitutional
power
have
disperse
,
my
sister
lie
very
ill
in
bed
.
<EOS>
Her
sight
be
disturb
,
so
that
she
see
object
multiply
,
and
grasp
at
visionary
teacup
and
wine
-
glass
instead
of
the
reality
<EOS>
;
her
hearing
be
greatly
impaired
;
her
memory
also
;
and
her
speech
be
unintelligible
.
<EOS>
when
,
at
last
,
she
come
round
so
far
as
to
be
help
down
-
stair
,
it
be
still
necessary
to
keep
my
slate
always
by
her
,
that
she
may
indicate
in
write
what
she
could
not
indicate
in
speech
.
<EOS>
as
she
be
(
very
bad
handwriting
apart
)
a
more
than
indifferent
speller
,
and
as
Joe
be
a
more
than
indifferent
reader
,
extraordinary
complication
arise
between
them
,
which
I
be
always
call
in
to
solve
.
<EOS>
the
administration
of
mutton
instead
of
medicine
,
the
substitution
of
tea
for
Joe
,
and
the
baker
for
bacon
,
be
among
the
mild
of
my
own
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
her
temper
be
greatly
improve
,
and
she
be
patient
.
<EOS>
a
tremulous
uncertainty
of
the
action
of
all
her
limb
soon
become
a
part
of
her
regular
state
,
and
afterwards
,
at
interval
of
two
or
three
month
,
she
would
often
put
her
hand
to
her
head
,
and
would
then
remain
for
about
a
week
at
a
time
in
some
gloomy
aberration
of
mind
.
<EOS>
We
be
at
a
loss
to
find
a
suitable
attendant
for
her
,
until
a
circumstance
happen
conveniently
to
relieve
us
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
conquer
a
confirmed
habit
of
live
into
which
she
have
fall
,
and
Biddy
become
a
part
of
our
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
about
a
month
after
my
sister
's
reappearance
in
the
kitchen
,
when
Biddy
come
to
us
with
a
small
speckled
box
contain
the
whole
of
her
worldly
effect
,
and
become
a
blessing
to
the
household
.
<EOS>
above
all
,
she
be
a
blessing
to
Joe
,
for
the
dear
old
fellow
be
sadly
cut
up
by
the
constant
contemplation
of
the
wreck
of
his
wife
,
and
have
be
accustom
,
while
attend
on
her
of
an
evening
,
to
turn
to
me
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
and
say
,
with
his
blue
eye
moisten
,
"
<EOS>
such
a
fine
figure
of
a
woman
as
she
once
be
,
Pip
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Biddy
instantly
take
the
clever
charge
of
her
as
though
she
have
study
her
from
infancy
,
Joe
become
able
in
some
sort
to
appreciate
the
great
quiet
of
his
life
,
and
to
get
down
to
the
Jolly
Bargemen
now
and
then
for
a
change
that
do
him
good
.
<EOS>
It
be
characteristic
of
the
police
people
that
they
have
all
more
or
less
suspect
poor
Joe
(
though
he
never
know
it
)
,
and
that
they
have
to
a
man
concur
in
regard
him
as
one
of
the
deep
spirit
they
have
ever
encounter
.
  
<EOS>
Biddy
's
first
triumph
in
her
new
office
,
be
to
solve
a
difficulty
that
have
completely
vanquish
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
try
hard
at
it
,
but
have
make
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
thus
it
be
:
  
again
and
again
and
again
,
my
sister
have
trace
upon
the
slate
,
a
character
that
look
like
a
curious
t
,
and
then
with
the
utmost
eagerness
have
call
our
attention
to
it
as
something
she
particularly
want
.
<EOS>
I
have
in
vain
try
everything
producible
that
begin
with
a
t
,
from
tar
to
toast
and
tub
.
<EOS>
at
length
it
have
come
into
my
head
that
the
sign
look
like
a
hammer
,
and
on
my
lustily
call
that
word
in
my
sister
's
ear
,
she
have
begin
to
hammer
on
the
table
and
have
express
a
qualified
assent
.
<EOS>
thereupon
,
I
have
bring
in
all
our
hammer
,
one
after
another
,
but
without
avail
.
<EOS>
then
I
bethink
me
of
a
crutch
,
the
shape
be
much
the
same
<EOS>
and
I
borrow
one
in
the
village
,
and
display
it
to
my
sister
with
considerable
confidence
.
<EOS>
but
she
shake
her
head
to
that
extent
when
she
be
show
it
,
that
we
be
terrified
lest
in
her
weak
and
shattered
state
she
should
dislocate
her
neck
.
  
<EOS>
when
my
sister
find
that
Biddy
be
very
quick
to
understand
her
,
this
mysterious
sign
reappear
on
the
slate
.
<EOS>
Biddy
look
thoughtfully
at
it
,
hear
my
explanation
,
look
thoughtfully
at
my
sister
,
look
thoughtfully
at
Joe
(
who
be
always
represent
on
the
slate
by
his
initial
letter
)
,
and
run
into
the
forge
,
follow
by
Joe
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
of
course
!
"
cry
Biddy
,
with
an
exultant
face
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
see
?
<EOS>
It
be
 
\
him
.
!
<EOS>
\
   
<EOS>
Orlick
,
without
a
doubt
!
<EOS>
She
have
lose
his
name
,
and
could
only
signify
him
by
his
hammer
.
<EOS>
We
tell
him
why
we
want
him
to
come
into
the
kitchen
,
and
he
slowly
lay
down
his
hammer
,
wipe
his
brow
with
his
arm
,
take
another
wipe
at
it
with
his
apron
,
and
come
slouch
out
,
with
a
curious
loose
vagabond
bend
in
the
knee
that
strongly
distinguish
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
that
I
expect
to
see
my
sister
denounce
him
,
and
that
I
be
disappoint
by
the
different
result
.
<EOS>
She
manifest
the
great
anxiety
to
be
on
good
term
with
him
,
be
evidently
much
pleased
by
his
being
at
length
produce
,
and
motion
that
she
would
have
him
give
something
to
drink
.
<EOS>
She
watch
his
countenance
as
if
she
be
particularly
wishful
to
be
assure
that
he
take
kindly
to
his
reception
,
she
show
every
possible
desire
to
conciliate
him
,
and
there
be
an
air
of
humble
propitiation
in
all
she
do
,
such
as
I
have
see
pervade
the
bearing
of
a
child
towards
a
hard
master
.
<EOS>
after
that
day
,
a
day
rarely
pass
without
her
draw
the
hammer
on
her
slate
,
and
without
Orlick
's
slouching
in
and
stand
doggedly
before
her
,
as
if
he
know
no
more
than
I
do
what
to
make
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
17
 
I
now
fall
into
a
regular
routine
of
apprenticeship
life
,
which
be
varied
beyond
the
limit
of
the
village
and
the
marsh
,
by
no
more
remarkable
circumstance
than
the
arrival
of
my
birthday
and
my
pay
another
visit
to
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
I
find
Miss
Sarah
Pocket
still
on
duty
at
the
gate
,
I
find
Miss
Havisham
just
as
I
have
leave
her
,
and
she
speak
of
Estella
in
the
very
same
way
,
if
not
in
the
very
same
word
.
<EOS>
the
interview
last
but
a
few
minute
,
and
she
give
me
a
guinea
when
I
be
go
,
and
tell
me
to
come
again
on
my
next
birthday
.
<EOS>
I
may
mention
at
once
that
this
become
an
annual
custom
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
decline
take
the
guinea
on
the
first
occasion
,
but
with
no
well
effect
than
cause
her
to
ask
me
very
angrily
,
if
I
expect
more
?
<EOS>
then
,
and
after
that
,
I
take
it
.
  
<EOS>
so
unchanging
be
the
dull
old
house
,
the
yellow
light
in
the
darkened
room
,
the
fade
spectre
in
the
chair
by
the
dressing
-
table
glass
,
that
I
feel
as
if
the
stopping
of
the
clock
have
stop
Time
in
that
mysterious
place
,
and
,
while
I
and
everything
else
outside
it
grow
old
,
it
stand
still
.
<EOS>
daylight
never
enter
the
house
as
to
my
thought
and
remembrance
of
it
,
any
more
than
as
to
the
actual
fact
.
<EOS>
It
bewilder
me
,
and
under
its
influence
I
continue
at
heart
to
hate
my
trade
and
to
be
ashamed
of
home
.
  
<EOS>
imperceptibly
I
become
conscious
of
a
change
in
Biddy
,
however
.
<EOS>
Her
shoe
come
up
at
the
heel
,
her
hair
grow
bright
and
neat
,
her
hand
be
always
clean
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
beautiful
---
she
be
common
,
and
could
not
be
like
Estella
---
but
she
be
pleasant
and
wholesome
and
sweet
-
tempered
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
with
us
more
than
a
year
(
I
remember
her
be
newly
out
of
mourn
at
the
time
it
strike
me
)
,
when
I
observe
to
myself
one
evening
that
she
have
curiously
thoughtful
and
attentive
eye
;
eye
that
be
very
pretty
and
very
good
.
  
<EOS>
It
come
of
my
lifting
up
my
own
eye
from
a
task
I
be
pore
at
---
write
some
passage
from
a
book
,
to
improve
myself
in
two
way
at
once
by
a
sort
of
stratagem
---
and
see
Biddy
observant
of
what
I
be
about
.
<EOS>
I
lay
down
my
pen
,
and
Biddy
stop
in
her
needlework
without
lay
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
"
how
do
you
manage
it
?
<EOS>
either
I
be
very
stupid
,
or
you
be
very
clever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
that
I
manage
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
"
return
Biddy
,
smile
.
  
<EOS>
She
manage
our
whole
domestic
life
,
and
wonderfully
too
;
but
I
do
not
mean
that
,
though
that
make
what
I
do
mean
,
more
surprising
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
manage
,
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
"
to
learn
everything
that
I
learn
,
and
always
to
keep
up
with
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
be
begin
to
be
rather
vain
of
my
knowledge
,
<EOS>
for
I
spend
my
birthday
guinea
on
it
,
and
set
aside
the
great
part
of
my
pocket
-
money
for
similar
investment
;
though
I
have
no
doubt
,
now
,
that
the
little
I
know
be
extremely
dear
at
the
price
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
as
well
ask
you
,
"
say
Biddy
,
"
how
 
\
you
\
 
manage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
because
when
I
come
in
from
the
forge
of
a
night
,
any
one
can
see
me
turn
to
at
it
.
<EOS>
but
you
never
turn
to
at
it
,
Biddy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
must
catch
it
---
like
a
cough
,
"
say
Biddy
,
quietly
;
and
go
on
with
her
sewing
.
  
<EOS>
pursue
my
idea
as
I
lean
back
in
my
wooden
chair
and
look
at
Biddy
sew
away
with
her
head
on
one
side
,
I
begin
to
think
her
rather
an
extraordinary
girl
.
<EOS>
for
,
I
call
to
mind
now
,
that
she
be
equally
accomplish
in
the
term
of
our
trade
,
and
the
name
of
our
different
sort
of
work
,
and
our
various
tool
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
whatever
I
know
,
Biddy
know
.
<EOS>
theoretically
,
she
be
already
as
good
a
blacksmith
as
I
,
or
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
one
of
those
,
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
"
who
make
the
most
of
every
chance
.
<EOS>
You
never
have
a
chance
before
you
come
here
,
and
see
how
improve
you
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
Biddy
look
at
me
for
an
instant
,
and
go
on
with
her
sewing
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
your
first
teacher
though
;
be
not
I
?
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
as
she
sew
.
  
<EOS>
"
Biddy
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
,
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
be
cry
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
I
be
not
,
"
say
Biddy
,
look
up
and
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
what
put
that
in
your
head
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
could
have
put
it
in
my
head
,
but
the
glistening
of
a
tear
as
it
drop
on
her
work
?
<EOS>
I
sit
silent
,
recall
what
a
drudge
she
have
be
until
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
successfully
overcome
that
bad
habit
of
living
,
so
highly
desirable
to
be
get
rid
of
by
some
people
.
<EOS>
I
recall
the
hopeless
circumstance
by
which
she
have
be
surround
in
the
miserable
little
shop
and
the
miserable
little
noisy
evening
school
,
with
that
miserable
old
bundle
of
incompetence
always
to
be
drag
and
shoulder
.
<EOS>
I
reflect
that
even
in
those
untoward
time
there
must
have
be
latent
in
Biddy
what
be
now
develop
,
for
,
in
my
first
uneasiness
and
discontent
<EOS>
I
have
turn
to
her
for
help
,
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
Biddy
sit
quietly
sew
,
shed
no
more
tear
,
and
while
I
look
at
her
and
think
about
it
all
,
it
occur
to
me
that
perhaps
I
have
not
be
sufficiently
grateful
to
Biddy
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
be
too
reserve
,
and
should
have
patronize
her
more
(
though
I
do
not
use
that
precise
word
in
my
meditation
)
,
with
my
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Biddy
<EOS>
,
"
I
observe
,
when
I
have
do
turn
it
over
,
"
you
be
my
first
teacher
,
and
that
at
a
time
when
we
little
thought
of
ever
be
together
like
this
,
in
this
kitchen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
poor
thing
!
"
<EOS>
reply
Biddy
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
her
self
-
forgetfulness
,
to
transfer
the
remark
to
my
sister
,
and
to
get
up
and
be
busy
about
her
,
make
her
more
comfortable
;
"
that
be
sadly
true
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
I
,
"
we
must
talk
together
a
little
more
,
as
we
use
to
do
.
<EOS>
and
I
must
consult
you
a
little
more
,
as
I
use
to
do
.
<EOS>
let
us
have
a
quiet
walk
on
the
marsh
next
Sunday
,
Biddy
,
and
a
long
chat
.
"
   
<EOS>
My
sister
be
never
leave
alone
now
;
but
Joe
more
than
readily
undertake
the
care
of
her
on
that
Sunday
afternoon
,
and
Biddy
<EOS>
and
I
go
out
together
.
<EOS>
It
be
summer
-
time
,
and
lovely
weather
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
pass
the
village
and
the
church
and
the
churchyard
,
and
be
out
on
the
marsh
and
begin
to
see
the
sail
of
the
ship
as
they
sail
on
,
I
begin
to
combine
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
with
the
prospect
,
in
my
usual
way
.
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
the
river
-
side
and
sit
down
on
the
bank
,
with
the
water
ripple
at
our
foot
,
make
it
all
more
quiet
than
it
would
have
be
without
that
sound
,
I
resolve
that
it
be
a
good
time
and
place
for
the
admission
of
Biddy
into
my
inner
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
after
bind
her
to
secrecy
,
"
I
want
to
be
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
would
not
,
if
I
be
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
return
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
would
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
with
some
severity
,
"
I
have
particular
reason
for
want
to
be
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
best
,
Pip
;
but
do
not
you
think
you
be
happy
as
you
be
?
  
<EOS>
"
Biddy
,
"
I
exclaim
,
impatiently
,
"
I
be
not
at
all
happy
as
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
disgusted
with
my
calling
and
with
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
take
to
either
,
since
I
be
bind
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
absurd
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
absurd
?
"
say
Biddy
,
quietly
raise
her
eyebrow
;
"
I
be
sorry
for
that
;
I
do
not
mean
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
only
want
you
to
do
well
,
and
to
be
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
then
,
understand
once
for
all
that
I
never
shall
or
can
be
comfortable
---
or
anything
but
miserable
---
there
,
Biddy
!
---
unless
I
can
lead
a
very
different
sort
of
life
from
the
life
I
lead
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
pity
!
"
<EOS>
say
Biddy
,
shake
her
head
with
a
sorrowful
air
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
I
too
have
so
often
think
it
a
pity
,
that
,
in
the
singular
kind
of
quarrel
with
myself
which
I
be
always
carry
on
,
I
be
half
inclined
to
shed
tear
of
vexation
and
distress
when
Biddy
give
utterance
to
her
sentiment
and
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
she
be
right
,
and
I
know
it
be
much
to
be
regret
,
but
still
it
be
not
to
be
help
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
could
have
settle
down
,
"
I
say
to
Biddy
,
pluck
up
the
short
grass
within
reach
,
much
as
I
have
once
upon
a
time
pull
my
feeling
out
of
my
hair
and
kick
them
into
the
brewery
wall
:
"
if
I
could
have
settle
down
and
be
but
half
as
fond
of
the
forge
as
I
be
when
I
be
little
,
I
know
it
would
have
be
much
well
for
me
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
and
Joe
would
have
want
nothing
then
,
and
Joe
and
I
would
perhaps
have
go
partner
when
I
be
out
of
my
time
,
and
I
may
even
have
grow
up
to
keep
company
with
you
and
we
may
have
sit
on
this
very
bank
on
a
fine
Sunday
,
quite
different
people
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
good
enough
for
you
;
should
not
I
,
Biddy
?
"
  
<EOS>
Biddy
sigh
as
she
look
at
the
ship
sail
on
,
and
return
for
answer
,
"
<EOS>
yes
;
I
be
not
over
-
particular
.
<EOS>
"
It
scarcely
sound
flattering
,
but
I
know
she
mean
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
instead
of
that
,
"
say
I
,
pluck
up
more
grass
and
chew
a
blade
or
two
,
"
see
how
I
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
dissatisfy
,
and
uncomfortable
,
and
<EOS>
---
what
would
it
signify
to
me
,
be
coarse
and
common
,
if
nobody
have
tell
me
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
Biddy
turn
her
face
suddenly
towards
mine
,
and
look
far
more
attentively
at
me
than
she
have
look
at
the
sailing
ship
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
neither
a
very
true
nor
a
very
polite
thing
to
say
,
"
she
remark
,
direct
her
eye
to
the
ship
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who
say
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
disconcert
,
for
I
have
break
away
without
quite
see
where
I
be
go
to
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
shuffle
off
now
,
however
,
and
I
answer
,
"
the
beautiful
young
lady
at
Miss
Havisham
's
,
and
she
be
more
beautiful
than
anybody
ever
be
,
and
I
admire
her
dreadfully
,
and
I
want
to
be
a
gentleman
on
her
account
.
"
<EOS>
have
make
this
lunatic
confession
,
I
begin
to
throw
my
tear
-
up
grass
into
the
river
,
as
if
I
have
some
thought
of
follow
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
want
to
be
a
gentleman
,
to
spite
her
or
to
gain
her
over
?
"
<EOS>
Biddy
quietly
ask
me
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
I
moodily
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
,
if
it
be
to
spite
her
,
"
Biddy
pursue
,
"
I
should
think
---
<EOS>
but
you
know
best
---
that
may
be
well
and
more
independently
do
by
care
nothing
for
her
word
.
<EOS>
and
if
it
be
to
gain
her
over
,
I
should
think
---
<EOS>
but
you
know
best
---
she
be
not
worth
gain
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
exactly
what
I
myself
have
think
,
many
time
.
<EOS>
exactly
what
be
perfectly
manifest
to
me
at
the
moment
.
<EOS>
but
how
could
I
,
a
poor
dazed
village
lad
,
avoid
that
wonderful
inconsistency
into
which
the
good
and
wise
of
man
fall
every
day
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
all
quite
true
,
"
say
I
to
Biddy
,
"
but
I
admire
her
dreadfully
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
turn
over
on
my
face
when
I
come
to
that
,
and
get
a
good
grasp
on
the
hair
on
each
side
of
my
head
,
and
wrench
it
well
.
<EOS>
all
the
while
know
the
madness
of
my
heart
to
be
so
very
mad
and
misplaced
,
that
I
be
quite
conscious
it
would
have
serve
my
face
<EOS>
right
,
if
I
have
lift
it
up
by
my
hair
,
and
knock
it
against
the
pebble
as
a
punishment
for
belong
to
such
an
idiot
.
  
<EOS>
Biddy
be
the
wise
of
girl
,
and
she
try
to
reason
no
more
with
me
.
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
,
which
be
a
comfortable
hand
though
roughen
by
work
,
upon
my
hand
,
one
after
another
,
and
gently
take
them
out
of
my
hair
.
<EOS>
then
she
softly
pat
my
shoulder
in
a
soothing
way
,
while
with
my
face
upon
my
sleeve
I
cry
a
little
---
exactly
as
I
have
do
in
the
brewery
yard
---
and
feel
vaguely
convinced
that
I
be
very
much
ill
-
use
by
somebody
,
or
by
everybody
;
I
can
not
say
which
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
one
thing
,
"
say
Biddy
,
"
and
that
is
,
that
you
have
feel
you
could
give
me
your
confidence
,
Pip
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
glad
of
another
thing
,
and
that
is
,
that
of
course
you
know
you
may
depend
upon
my
keep
it
and
always
so
far
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
if
your
first
teacher
(
dear
!
<EOS>
such
a
poor
one
,
and
so
much
in
need
of
be
teach
herself
!
)
have
be
your
teacher
at
the
present
time
,
she
think
she
know
what
lesson
she
would
set
.
<EOS>
but
it
would
be
a
hard
one
to
learn
,
and
you
have
get
beyond
her
,
and
it
be
of
no
use
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
with
a
quiet
sigh
for
me
,
Biddy
rise
from
the
bank
,
and
say
,
with
a
fresh
and
pleasant
change
of
voice
,
"
Shall
we
walk
a
little
further
,
or
go
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Biddy
,
"
I
cry
,
get
up
,
put
my
arm
round
her
neck
,
and
give
her
a
kiss
,
<EOS>
"
I
shall
always
tell
you
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
till
you
be
a
gentleman
,
"
say
Biddy
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
never
shall
be
,
so
that
be
always
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
have
any
occasion
to
tell
you
anything
,
for
you
know
everything
I
know
---
as
I
tell
you
at
home
the
other
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
Biddy
,
quite
in
a
whisper
,
as
she
look
away
at
the
ship
.
<EOS>
and
then
repeat
,
with
her
former
pleasant
change
;
"
shall
we
walk
a
little
further
,
or
go
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
to
Biddy
we
would
walk
a
little
further
,
and
we
do
so
,
and
the
summer
afternoon
tone
down
into
the
summer
evening
,
and
it
be
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
consider
whether
I
be
not
more
naturally
and
wholesomely
situate
,
after
all
,
in
these
circumstance
,
than
play
beggar
my
neighbour
by
candlelight
in
the
room
with
the
stop
clock
,
and
be
despise
by
Estella
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
very
good
for
me
if
I
could
get
her
out
of
my
head
,
with
all
the
rest
of
those
remembrance
and
fancy
,
and
could
go
to
work
determine
to
relish
what
I
have
to
do
,
and
stick
to
it
,
and
make
the
good
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
ask
myself
the
question
whether
I
do
not
surely
know
that
if
Estella
be
beside
me
at
that
moment
instead
of
Biddy
,
she
would
make
me
miserable
?
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
admit
that
I
do
know
it
for
a
certainty
,
and
I
say
to
myself
,
"
Pip
,
what
a
fool
you
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
talk
a
good
deal
as
we
walk
,
and
all
that
Biddy
say
seem
right
.
<EOS>
Biddy
be
never
insult
,
or
capricious
,
or
Biddy
to
-
day
and
somebody
else
to
-
morrow
;
she
would
have
derive
only
pain
,
and
no
pleasure
,
from
give
me
pain
;
she
would
far
rather
have
wound
her
own
breast
than
mine
.
<EOS>
how
could
it
be
,
then
,
that
I
do
not
like
her
much
the
well
of
the
two
?
  
<EOS>
"
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
when
we
be
walk
homeward
,
"
I
wish
you
could
put
me
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
!
"
say
Biddy
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
could
only
get
myself
to
fall
in
love
with
you
---
you
do
not
mind
my
speaking
so
openly
to
such
an
old
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
not
at
all
!
"
say
Biddy
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
mind
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
could
only
get
myself
to
do
it
,
 
\
that
\
 
would
be
the
thing
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
never
will
,
you
see
,
"
say
Biddy
.
  
<EOS>
It
do
not
appear
quite
so
unlikely
to
me
that
evening
,
as
it
would
have
do
if
we
have
discuss
it
a
few
hour
before
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
observe
I
be
not
quite
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
but
Biddy
say
she
 
\
be
,
<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
and
she
say
it
decisively
.
<EOS>
in
my
heart
I
believe
her
to
be
right
;
and
yet
I
take
it
rather
ill
,
too
,
that
she
should
be
so
positive
on
the
point
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
near
the
churchyard
,
we
have
to
cross
an
embankment
,
and
get
over
a
stile
near
a
sluice
gate
.
<EOS>
there
start
up
,
from
the
gate
,
or
from
the
rush
,
or
from
the
ooze
(
which
be
quite
in
his
stagnant
way
)
,
Old
Orlick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
<EOS>
he
growl
,
"
<EOS>
where
be
you
two
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
should
we
be
go
,
but
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
jiggere
if
I
do
not
see
you
home
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
penalty
of
be
jiggere
be
a
favourite
supposititious
case
of
his
.
<EOS>
He
attach
no
definite
meaning
to
the
word
that
I
be
aware
of
,
but
use
it
,
like
his
own
pretended
christian
name
,
to
affront
mankind
,
and
convey
an
idea
of
something
savagely
damaging
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
young
,
I
have
have
a
general
belief
that
if
he
have
jiggere
me
personally
,
he
would
have
do
it
with
a
sharp
and
twisted
hook
.
  
<EOS>
Biddy
be
much
against
his
go
with
us
,
and
say
to
me
in
a
whisper
,
"
do
not
let
him
come
;
I
do
not
like
him
.
"
<EOS>
as
I
do
not
like
him
either
,
I
take
the
liberty
of
say
that
we
thank
him
,
but
we
do
not
want
see
home
.
<EOS>
He
receive
that
piece
of
information
with
a
yell
of
laughter
,
and
drop
back
,
but
come
slouch
after
us
at
a
little
distance
.
  
<EOS>
curious
to
know
whether
Biddy
suspect
him
of
have
have
a
hand
in
that
murderous
attack
of
which
my
sister
have
never
be
able
to
give
any
account
<EOS>
,
I
ask
her
why
she
do
not
like
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
<EOS>
she
reply
,
glance
over
her
shoulder
as
he
slouch
after
us
,
"
because
I
---
I
be
afraid
he
like
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
ever
tell
you
he
like
you
?
"
<EOS>
I
ask
,
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Biddy
,
glance
over
her
shoulder
again
<EOS>
,
"
he
never
tell
me
so
;
but
he
dance
at
me
,
whenever
he
can
catch
my
eye
.
"
  
<EOS>
however
novel
and
peculiar
this
testimony
of
attachment
,
I
do
not
doubt
the
accuracy
of
the
interpretation
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
hot
indeed
upon
Old
Orlick
's
daring
to
admire
her
;
as
hot
as
if
it
be
an
outrage
on
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
make
no
difference
to
you
,
you
know
,
"
say
Biddy
,
calmly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Biddy
,
it
make
no
difference
to
me
;
only
I
do
not
like
it
;
I
do
not
approve
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
I
neither
,
"
say
Biddy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
though
 
\
that
\
 
make
no
difference
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
exactly
,
"
say
I
;
"
but
I
must
tell
you
I
should
have
no
opinion
of
you
Biddy
,
if
he
dance
at
you
with
your
own
consent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
keep
an
eye
on
Orlick
after
that
night
,
and
,
whenever
circumstance
be
favourable
to
his
dancing
at
Biddy
,
get
before
him
,
to
obscure
that
demonstration
.
<EOS>
He
have
strike
root
in
Joe
's
establishment
,
by
reason
of
my
sister
's
sudden
fancy
for
him
,
or
I
should
have
try
to
get
him
dismiss
.
<EOS>
He
quite
understand
and
reciprocate
my
good
intention
,
as
I
have
reason
to
know
thereafter
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
because
my
mind
be
not
confuse
enough
before
,
I
complicate
its
confusion
fifty
thousand
-
fold
,
by
have
state
and
season
when
I
be
clear
that
Biddy
be
immeasurably
well
than
Estella
,
and
that
the
plain
honest
work
life
to
which
I
be
bear
,
have
nothing
in
it
to
be
ashamed
of
,
but
offer
me
sufficient
mean
of
self
-
respect
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
at
those
time
,
I
would
decide
conclusively
that
my
disaffection
to
dear
old
Joe
and
the
forge
,
be
go
,
and
that
I
be
grow
up
in
a
fair
way
to
be
partner
with
Joe
and
to
keep
company
with
Biddy
---
when
all
in
a
moment
some
confound
remembrance
of
the
Havisham
day
would
fall
upon
me
,
like
a
destructive
missile
,
and
scatter
my
wit
again
.
<EOS>
scatter
wit
take
a
long
time
pick
up
;
and
often
,
before
I
have
get
them
well
together
,
they
would
be
disperse
in
all
direction
by
one
stray
thought
,
that
perhaps
after
all
Miss
Havisham
be
go
to
make
my
fortune
when
my
time
be
out
.
  
<EOS>
if
my
time
have
run
out
,
it
would
have
leave
me
still
at
the
height
of
my
perplexity
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
It
never
do
run
out
,
however
,
but
be
bring
to
a
premature
end
,
as
I
proceed
to
relate
.
    
<EOS>
chapter
18
 
it
be
in
the
fourth
year
of
my
apprenticeship
to
Joe
,
and
it
be
a
Saturday
night
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
group
assemble
round
the
fire
at
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
,
attentive
to
Mr
Wopsle
as
he
read
the
newspaper
aloud
.
<EOS>
of
that
group
I
be
one
.
  
<EOS>
a
highly
popular
murder
have
be
commit
,
and
Mr
Wopsle
be
imbrue
in
blood
to
the
eyebrow
.
<EOS>
He
gloat
over
every
abhorrent
adjective
in
the
description
,
and
identify
himself
with
every
witness
at
the
Inquest
.
<EOS>
He
faintly
moan
,
"
I
be
do
for
,
"
as
the
victim
,
and
he
barbarously
bellow
,
"
I
will
serve
you
out
,
"
as
the
murderer
.
<EOS>
He
give
the
medical
testimony
,
in
pointed
imitation
of
our
local
practitioner
;
and
he
pipe
and
shake
,
as
the
aged
turnpike
-
keeper
who
have
hear
blow
,
to
an
extent
so
very
paralytic
as
to
suggest
a
doubt
regard
the
mental
competency
of
that
witness
.
<EOS>
the
coroner
,
in
Mr
Wopsle
's
hand
,
become
Timon
of
Athens
;
the
beadle
,
Coriolanus
.
<EOS>
He
enjoy
himself
thoroughly
,
and
we
all
enjoy
ourselves
,
and
be
delightfully
comfortable
.
<EOS>
in
this
cosy
state
of
mind
we
come
to
the
verdict
wilful
murder
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
and
not
sooner
,
I
become
aware
of
a
strange
gentleman
lean
over
the
back
of
the
settle
opposite
me
,
look
on
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
expression
of
contempt
on
his
face
,
and
he
bite
the
side
of
a
great
forefinger
as
he
watch
the
group
of
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
the
stranger
to
Mr
Wopsle
,
when
the
reading
be
do
,
"
you
have
settle
it
all
to
your
own
satisfaction
,
I
have
no
doubt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
everybody
start
and
look
up
,
as
if
it
be
the
murderer
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
everybody
coldly
and
sarcastically
.
  
<EOS>
"
guilty
,
of
course
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
out
with
it
.
<EOS>
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
return
Mr
Wopsle
,
"
without
have
the
honour
of
your
acquaintance
,
I
do
say
Guilty
.
<EOS>
"
upon
this
,
we
all
take
courage
to
unite
in
a
confirmatory
murmur
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
,
"
say
the
stranger
;
"
I
know
you
would
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
so
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
will
ask
you
a
question
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
or
do
you
not
know
,
that
the
law
of
England
suppose
every
man
to
be
innocent
,
until
he
be

---
prove
---
to
be
guilty

"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
Mr
Wopsle
begin
to
reply
,
"
as
an
Englishman
myself
,
I
---
"
  
"
come
!
"
<EOS>
say
the
stranger
,
bite
his
forefinger
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
evade
the
question
.
<EOS>
either
you
know
it
,
or
you
do
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
which
be
it
to
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
stand
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
himself
on
one
side
,
in
a
bully
interrogative
manner
,
and
he
throw
his
forefinger
at
Mr
Wopsle
---
as
it
be
to
mark
him
out
---
before
bite
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
!
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
I
know
it

"
reply
Mr
Wopsle
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
you
know
it
.
<EOS>
then
why
do
not
you
say
so
at
first
?
<EOS>
now
,
I
will
ask
you
another
question
;
"
take
possession
of
Mr
Wopsle
,
as
if
he

a
right

Mr

I

only

when

You

one
word
from
you

<EOS>
yes

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
hesitate
,
and
we
all
begin
to
conceive
rather
a
poor
opinion
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
!
"
<EOS>
say
the
stranger
,
"
I
will
help
you

<EOS>
You
do
not

I
will
help
you

<EOS>
look
at
that
paper
you

<EOS>
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it

repeat
Mr

eye
it

much
at
a
loss

pursue
the
stranger
in

most
sarcastic

suspicious
manner

from

<EOS>
"
  
"
undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
undoubtedly

<EOS>
now
,
turn
to
that
paper

and
tell
me
whether
it

state
that
the
prisoner
expressly
say
that
his

him
altogether

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
read
that
just
now

Mr
Wopsle
plead
.
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
what
you
read
just
now

sir
;
I
do
not

You
may

Prayer
backwards

you
like

,
perhaps
,
have
do
it
before

<EOS>
turn
to
the
paper

<EOS>
no
,
no
,
no

bottom

to
the
bottom

"
<EOS>
(
We
all
begin
to
think
Mr
Wopsle
full
of
subterfuge

)
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
?
<EOS>
have
you
find
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
here
it
be
,
"
say
Mr
Wopsle
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
follow
that
passage
with
your
eye
,

tell
me

you

Mr
Wopsle

round
at
the
rest
of
the
company
with
his
right
hand
extend
towards
the
witness

Wopsle

"
<EOS>
and
now
I
ask
you
what
you
say
to
the
conscience
of
that
man
who
,
with
that
passage
before
his
eye

can
lay
his
head
upon
his
pillow
after
have
pronounce
a
fellow
-
creature
guilty
,
unheard
?
"
  
<EOS>
We
all
begin
to
suspect
that
Mr
Wopsle
be
not
the
man
we
have
think
him
,
and
that
he
be
begin
to
be
find
out

<EOS>
"
and
that

remember
,

his

at
Mr

heavily
;

that

man
may
be
summon
as
a
juryman
upon

very
trial

,
have
thus
deeply
commit
himself

may
return
to
the
bosom
of
his
family

lay
his
head
upon
his
pillow

after
deliberately
swear
that
he
would
well
and
truly
try
the
issue
join
between
Our
Sovereign
Lord
the
King
and
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
,

would
a
true
verdict
give
accord
to
the
evidence

so
help
him
God
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
be
all
deeply
persuade
that
the
unfortunate
Wopsle
have
go
too
far
,
and
have
well
stop
in
his
reckless
career

there
be
yet
time

the

with

authority

manner
expressive

know
something
secret
about
every
one
of
us
that
would
effectually
do
for
each
individual
if
he
choose
to
disclose
it

leave

<EOS>
amidst
a
wonder
silence

we
three
walk
out
of
the
Jolly
Bargemen

in
a
wonder
silence
walk
home

while
go
along

He

little
aside

after

round

"
now
,
Joseph
Gargery
,
I
be
the
bearer
of
an
offer
to
relieve
you
of
this
young
fellow
your
apprentice

<EOS>
You
would
not

You

the

Joe

sternly
,
"
no

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
Mr
Jaggers
glance
at
Joe
,
as
if
he
consider
him
a
fool
for
his
disinterestedness
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
too
much
bewilder
between
breathless
curiosity
and
surprise
,
to
be
sure
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well

"
say
Mr

.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
recollect
the

<EOS>
"
yes

"
repeat
Mr
Jaggers
,
shut
his
eye
and
nod
his
head
at
Joe
,
as
if
he
be
forgive
him
something
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
I
return
to
this
young

<EOS>
and
the
communication
I
have
get
to
make
be
,
that
he
have
great
expectation

"
  
<EOS>
Joe
and
I
gasp
,
and
look
at
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
instruct
to
communicate
to
him
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
throw
his
finger
at
me
sideways
,
"
that
he
will
come
into
a
handsome
property
.
<EOS>
further
,
that
it
be
the
desire
of
the

possessor
of
that
property
,
that
he

immediately
remove
from
his
present
sphere
of
life
and
from
this
place
,
and
be
bring
up
as
a
gentleman
---
in
a
word
,
as
a
young
fellow
of
great
expectation

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
dream
be
out
;
my
wild
fancy
be
surpass
by
sober
reality
;
Miss
Havisham
be
go
to
make
my
fortune
on
a
grand
scale
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Mr
Pip
,
"
pursue
the
lawyer
,
"
I
address
the
rest
of
what
I
have
to
say
,
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
be
to
understand
,
first
,
that
it
be
the
request
of
the
person
from
whom
I
take
my
instruction
,
that
you
always
bear
the
name
of
Pip
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
no
objection
,
I
dare
say
,
to
your
great
expectation
be
encumber
with
that
easy
condition
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
have
any
objection
,
this
be
the
time
to
mention
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
heart
be
beat
so
fast
,
and
there
be
such
a
singing
in
my
ear
,
<EOS>
that
I
could
scarcely
stammer
I
have
no
objection
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
!
<EOS>
now
you
be
to
understand
,
secondly
,
Mr
Pip
,
that
the
name
of
the
person
who
be
your
liberal
benefactor
remain
a
profound
secret
,
until
the
person
choose
to
reveal
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
empower
to
mention
that
it
be
the
intention
of
the
person
to
reveal
it
at
first
hand
by
word
of
mouth
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
when
or
where
that
intention
may
be
carry
out
,
I
can
not
say
;
no
one
can
say
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
year
hence
.
<EOS>
now
,
you
be
distinctly
to
understand
that
you
be
most
positively
prohibit
from
make
any
inquiry
on
this
head
,
or
any
allusion
or
reference
,
however
distant
,
to
any
individual
whomsoever
as
 
\
<EOS>
the
\
 
individual
,
in
all
the
communication
you
may
have
with
me
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
a
suspicion
in
your
own
breast
,
keep
that
suspicion
in
your
own
breast
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
least
to
the
purpose
what
the
reason
of
this
prohibition
be
;
they
may
be
the
strong
and
gravest
reason
,
or
they
may
be
mere
whim
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
for
you
to
inquire
into
.
<EOS>
the
condition
be
lay
down
.
<EOS>
Your
acceptance
of
it
,
and
your
observance
of
it
as
bind
,
be
the
only
remain
condition
that
I
be
charge
with
,
by
the
person
from
whom
I
take
my
instruction
,
and
for
whom
I
be
not
otherwise
responsible
.
<EOS>
that
person
be
the
person
from
whom
you
derive
your
expectation
,
and
the
secret
be
solely
hold
by
that
person
and
by
me
.
<EOS>
again
,
not
a
very
difficult
condition
with
which
to
encumber
such
a
rise
in
fortune
;
but
if
you
have
any
objection
to
it
,
this
be
the
time
to
mention
it
.
<EOS>
speak
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
once
more
,
I
stammer
with
difficulty
that
I
have
no
objection
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
!
<EOS>
now
,
Mr
Pip
,
I
have
do
with
stipulation
.
<EOS>
"
though
he
call
me
Mr
Pip
,
and
begin
rather
to
make
up
to
me
,
he
still
could
not
get
rid
of
a
certain
air
of
bully
suspicion
;
and
even
now
he
occasionally
shut
his
eye
and
throw
his
finger
at
me
while
he
speak
,
as
much
as
to
express
that
he
know
all
kind
of
thing
to
my
disparagement
,
if
he
only
choose
to
mention
them
.
<EOS>
"
We
come
next
,
to
mere
detail
of
arrangement
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
that
,
although
I
have
use
the
term
"
expectation
"
more
than
once
,
you
be
not
endow
with
expectation
only
.
<EOS>
there
be
already
lodge
in
my
hand
,
a
sum
of
money
amply
sufficient
for
your
suitable
education
and
maintenance
.
<EOS>
You
will
please
consider
me
your
guardian
.
<EOS>
oh
!
"
for
I
be
go
to
thank
him
,
"
I
tell
you
at
once
,
I
be
pay
for
my
service
,
or
I
should
not
render
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
consider
that
you
must
be
better
educate
,
in
accordance
with
your
alter
position
,
and
that
you
will
be
alive
to
the
importance
and
necessity
of
at
once
enter
on
that
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
I
have
always
long
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
never

what
you

always

Mr
Pip

he
retort
;
"
keep
to
the
record

<EOS>
if
you
long
for
it
now

that
be
enough

be

I
answer
that

your

I
have
never

of
any
tutor
but
Biddy
and
Mr
Wopsle
's
great

aunt

so
,
I
reply
in
the
negative
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
certain
tutor

I

some
knowledge

may
suit

say
Mr
Jaggers
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

Miss

<EOS>
"
You
know

say
Mr
Jaggers
,
look
shrewdly
at
me
,
and
then
shut
up
his
eye
while
he
wait
for
my
answer

My
answer
be

that

he
.
<EOS>

directly

lay
his

upon

with
the
touch
of
a

<EOS>
I
have
often
think
him
since

like
the
steam

hammer

that

crush
a

have
look
on
at
this
,
as
one
who
recognize
in
Joe
the
village
idiot
,
and
in
me
his
keeper
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
over
,
he
say
,
weigh
in
his
hand
the
purse
he
have
cease
to
swing
:
  
"
<EOS>
now
,
Joseph
Gargery
,
I
warn
you

be
your
last
chance
.
<EOS>
no
half
measure
with
me
.
<EOS>
if
you
mean
to
take
a
present
that
I
have
it
in
charge
to
make
you
,
speak
out
,
and
you
shall
have
it
.
<EOS>
if
on
the
contrary
you
mean
to
say
---
"
here
,
to
his
great
amazement
,
he
be
stop
by
Joe
's
suddenly
work
round
him
with
every
demonstration
of
a
fell
pugilistic
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
which
I
meantersay
,
"
cry
Joe
,
"
that
if
you
come
into
my
place

<EOS>
which
I
meantersay

<EOS>
which
I
meantersay
that
what
I
say
,
I
meantersay
and
stand
or
fall
by
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
draw
Joe
away
,
and
he
immediately
become
placable
;
merely
state
to
me
,
in
an
obliging
manner
and
as
a
polite
expostulatory
notice
to
any
one
whom
it
may
happen
to
concern
,
that
he
be
not
a
go
to
be
bull
-
bait
and
badger
in
his
own
place
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
have
rise
when
Joe
demonstrate
,
and
have
back
near
the
door
.
<EOS>
without
evince
any
inclination
to
come
in
again
,
he
there
deliver
his
valedictory
remark
.
<EOS>
They
be
these
:
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
Mr
Pip
,
I
think
the
sooner
you
leave
here
---
as
you
be
to
be
a
gentleman
---
the
well
.
<EOS>
let
it
stand
for
this
day
week
,
and
you
shall
receive
my
print
address
in
the
meantime
.
<EOS>
You
can
take
a
hackney
-
coach
at
the
stage
-
coach
office
in
London
,
and
come
straight
to
me
.
<EOS>
understand
,
that
I
express
no
opinion
,
one
way
or
other
,
on
the
trust
I
undertake
.
<EOS>
I
be
pay
for
undertake
it
,
and
I
do
so
.
<EOS>
now
,
understand
that
,
finally
.
<EOS>
understand
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
throw
his
finger
at
both
of
us
,
and
I
think
would
have
go
on
,
but
for
his
seeming
to
think
Joe
dangerous
,
and
go
off
.
  
<EOS>
something
come
into
my
head
which
induce
me
to
run
after
him
,
as
he
be
go
down
to
the
Jolly
Bargemen
where
he
have
leave
a
hire
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Jaggers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
say
he
,
face
round
,
"
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
be
quite
right
,
Mr
Jaggers
,
and
to
keep
to
your
direction
;
so
I
think
I
have
better
ask
.
<EOS>
Would
there
be
any
objection
to
my
taking
leave
of
any
one
I
know
,
about
here
,
before
I
go
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
he
,
look
as
if
he
hardly
understand
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
in
the
village
only
,
but
up
-
town
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
objection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thank
him
and
run
home
again
,
and
there
I
find
that
Joe
have
already
lock
the
front
door
and
vacate
the
state
parlour
,
and
be
seat
by
the
kitchen
fire
with
a
hand
on
each
knee
,
gaze
intently
at
the
burn
coal
.
<EOS>
I
too
sit
down
before
the
fire
and
gaze
at
the
coal
,
and
nothing
be
say
for
a
long
time
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
be
in
her
cushion
chair
in
her
corner
,
and
Biddy
sit
at
her
needlework
before
the
fire
,
and
Joe
sit
next
Biddy
,
and
I
sit
next
Joe
in
the
corner
opposite
my
sister
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
look
into
the
glow
coal
,
<EOS>
the
more
incapable
I
become
of
look
at
Joe
;
the
long
the
silence
last
,
the
more
unable
I
feel
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
I
get
out
,
"
Joe
,
have
you
tell
Biddy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Pip
,
"
return
Joe
,
still
look
at
the
fire
,
and
hold
his
knee
tight
,
as
if
he
have
private
information
that
they
intend
to
make
off
somewhere
,
"
which
I
leave
it
to
yourself
,
Pip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
you
tell
,
Joe
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pip
be
a
gentleman
of
fortun
'
then
,
"
say
Joe
,
"
and
God
bless
him
init
!
"
  
<EOS>
Biddy
drop
her
work
,
and
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
Joe
hold
his
knee
and
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
both
of
them
.
<EOS>
after
a
pause
,
they
both
heartily
congratulate
me
;
but
there
be
a
certain
touch
of
sadness
in
their
congratulation
,
that
I
rather
resent
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
it
upon
myself
to
impress
Biddy
<EOS>
(
and
through
Biddy
,
Joe
)
with
the
grave
obligation
I
consider
my
friend
under
,
to
know
nothing
and
say
nothing
about
the
maker
of
my
fortune
.
<EOS>
It
would
all
come
out
in
good
time
,
I
observe
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
nothing
be
to
be
say
,
save
that
I
have
come
into
great
expectation
from
a
mysterious
patron
.
<EOS>
Biddy
nod
her
head
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
as
she
take
up
her
work
again
,
and
say
she
would
be
very
particular
;
and
Joe
,
still
detain
his
knee
,
say
,
"
ay
,
ay
,
I
will
be
ekervally
partickler
,
Pip
;
"
and
then
they
congratulate
me
again
,
and
go
on
to
express
so
much
wonder
at
the
notion
of
my
be
a
gentleman
,
that
I
do
not
half
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
Infinite
pain
be
then
take
by
Biddy
to
convey
to
my
sister
some
idea
of
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
to
the
good
of
my
belief
,
those
effort
entirely
fail
.
<EOS>
She
laugh
and
nod
her
head
a
great
many
time
,
and
even
repeat
after
Biddy
,
the
word
"
Pip
"
and
"
property
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
if
they
have
more
meaning
in
them
than
an
election
cry
,
and
I
can
not
suggest
a
dark
picture
of
her
state
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
believe
it
without
experience
,
but
as
Joe
and
Biddy
become
more
at
their
cheerful
ease
again
,
I
become
quite
gloomy
.
<EOS>
dissatisfied
with
my
fortune
,
of
course
I
could
not
be
;
but
it
be
possible
that
I
may
have
be
,
without
quite
know
it
,
dissatisfied
with
myself
.
  
<EOS>
anyhow
,
I
sit
with
my
elbow
on
my
knee
and
my
face
upon
my
hand
,
look
into
the
fire
,
as
those
two
talk
about
my
go
away
,
and
about
what
they
should
do
without
me
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
and
whenever
I
catch
one
of
them
look
at
me
,
though
never
  
so
pleasantly
(
and
they
often
look
at
me
---
particularly
Biddy
)
,
<EOS>
I
  
feel
offended
:
as
if
they
be
express
some
mistrust
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
though
Heaven
know
they
never
do
by
word
or
sign
.
  
<EOS>
at
those
time
I
would
get
up
and
look
out
at
the
door
;
for
,
our
kitchen
door
open
at
once
upon
the
night
,
and
stand
open
on
summer
evening
to
air
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
very
star
to
which
I
then
raise
my
eye
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
I
take
to
be
but
poor
and
humble
star
for
glitter
on
the
rustic
object
among
which
I
have
pass
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Saturday
night
,
"
say
I
,
when
we
sit
at
our
supper
of
bread
-
and
-
cheese
and
beer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
five
more
day
,
and
then
the
day
before
 
\
<EOS>
the

day
!
<EOS>
They
will
soon
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Pip
,
"
observe
Joe
,
whose
voice
sound
hollow
in
his
beer
mug
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
soon
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
soon
,
soon
go
,
"
say
Biddy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
think
,
Joe
,
that
when
I
go
down
on
Monday
,
and
order
my
new
clothe
,
I
shall
tell
the
tailor
that
I
will
come
and
put
them
on
there
,
or
that
I
will
have
them
send
to
Mr
Pumblechook
's
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
very
disagreeable
to
be
stare
at
by
all
the
people
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
and
Mrs
Hubble
may
like
to
see
you
in
your
new
gen
-
teel
figure
too
,
Pip
,
"
say
Joe
,
industriously
cut
his
bread
,
with
his
cheese
on
it
,
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
,
and
glance
at
my
untasted
supper
as
if
he
think
of
the
time
when
we
use
to
compare
slice
.
<EOS>
"
so
may
wopsle
.
<EOS>
and
the
Jolly
Bargemen
may
take
it
as
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
what
I
do
not
want
,
Joe
.
<EOS>
They
would
make
such
a
business
of
it
---
such
a
coarse
and
common
business
---
that
I
could
not
bear
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
that
indeed
,
Pip
!
"
say
Joe
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
could
not
abear
yourself
---
"
  
Biddy
ask
me
here
,
as
she
sit
hold
my
sister
's
plate
,
"
have
you
think
about
when
you
will
show
yourself
to
Mr
Gargery
,
and
your
sister
,
and
me
?
<EOS>
You
will
show
yourself
to
us
;
will
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Biddy
,
"
I
return
with
some
resentment
,
"
you
be
so
exceedingly
quick
that
it
be
difficult
to
keep
up
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
(
"
She
always
be
quick
,
"
observe
Joe
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
wait
another
moment
,
Biddy
,
you
would
have
hear
me
say
that
I
shall
bring
my
clothe
here
in
a
bundle
one
evening
---
most
likely
on
the
evening
before
I
go
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
Biddy
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
handsomely
forgive
her
,
I
soon
exchange
an
affectionate
good
-
night
with
her
and
Joe
,
and
go
up
to
bed
.
<EOS>
when
I
get
into
my
little
room
,
I
sit
down
and
take
a
long
look
at
it
,
as
a
mean
little
room
that
I
should
soon
be
part
from
and
raise
above
,
for
ever
.
<EOS>
It
be
furnish
with
fresh
young
remembrance
too
,
and
even
at
the
same
moment
I
fall
into
much
the
same
confused
division
of
mind
between
it
and
the
well
room
to
which
I
be
go
,
as
I
have
be
in
so
often
between
the
forge
and
Miss
Havisham
's
,
and
Biddy
and
Estella
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
have
be
shine
brightly
all
day
on
the
roof
of
my
attic
,
and
the
room
be
warm
.
<EOS>
as
I
put
the
window
open
and
stand
look
out
,
I
see
Joe
come
slowly
forth
at
the
dark
door
below
,
and
take
a
turn
or
two
in
the
air
;
and
then
I
see
Biddy
come
,
and
bring
him
a
pipe
and
light
it
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
never
smoke
so
late
,
and
it
seem
to
hint
to
me
that
he
want
comforting
,
for
some
reason
or
other
.
  
<EOS>
He
presently
stand
at
the
door
immediately
beneath
me
,
smoke
his
pipe
,
and
Biddy
stand
there
too
,
quietly
talk
to
him
,
and
I
know
that
they
talk
of
me
,
for
I
hear
my
name
mention
in
an
endearing
tone
by
both
of
them
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
listen
for
more
,
if
I
could
have
hear
more
:
<EOS>
so
,
I
draw
away
from
the
window
,
and
sit
down
in
my
one
chair
by
the
bedside
,
feel
it
very
sorrowful
and
strange
that
this
first
night
of
my
bright
fortune
should
be
the
lonely
I
have
ever
know
.
  
<EOS>
look
towards
the
open
window
,
I
see
light
wreath
from
Joe
's
pipe
float
there
,
and
I
fancy
it
be
like
a
blessing
from
Joe
---
not
obtruded
on
me
or
parade
before
me
,
but
pervade
the
air
we
share
together
.
<EOS>
I
put
my
light
out
,
and
creep
into
bed
;
and
it
be
an
uneasy
bed
now
,
and
I
never
sleep
the
old
sound
sleep
in
it
any
more
.
    
<EOS>
chapter
19
 
morning
make
a
considerable
difference
in
my
general
prospect
of
Life
and
brighten
it
so
much
that
it
scarcely
seem
the
same
.
<EOS>
what
lie
heaviest
on
my
mind
,
be
,
the
consideration
that
six
day
intervene
between
me
and
the
day
of
departure
;
for
,
I
could
not
divest
myself
of
a
misgiving
that
something
may
happen
to
London
in
the
meanwhile
,
and
that
,
when
I
get
there
,
it
would
be
either
greatly
deteriorate
or
clean
go
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
and
Biddy
be
very
sympathetic
and
pleasant
when
I
speak
of
our
approach
separation
;
but
they
only
refer
to
it
when
I
do
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
Joe
bring
out
my
indenture
from
the
press
in
the
good
parlour
,
and
we
put
them
in
the
fire
,
and
I
feel
that
I
be
free
.
<EOS>
with
all
the
novelty
of
my
emancipation
on
me
,
I
go
to
church
with
Joe
,
and
think
,
perhaps
the
clergyman
would
not
have
read
that
about
the
rich
man
and
the
kingdom
of
Heaven
,
if
he
have
know
all
.
  
<EOS>
after
our
early
dinner
I
stroll
out
alone
,
purpose
to
finish
off
the
marsh
at
once
,
and
get
them
do
with
.
<EOS>
as
I
pass
the
church
,
I
feel
(
as
I
have
feel
during
service
in
the
morning
)
<EOS>
a
sublime
compassion
for
the
poor
creature
who
be
destine
to
go
there
,
Sunday
after
Sunday
,
all
their
life
through
,
and
to
lie
obscurely
at
last
among
the
low
green
mound
.
<EOS>
I
promise
myself
that
I
would
do
something
for
them
one
of
these
day
,
and
form
a
plan
in
outline
for
bestow
a
dinner
of
roast
-
beef
and
plum
-
pudding
,
a
pint
of
ale
,
and
a
gallon
of
condescension
,
upon
everybody
in
the
village
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
often
think
before
,
with
something
ally
to
shame
,
of
my
companionship
with
the
fugitive
whom
I
have
once
see
limp
among
those
grave
,
what
be
my
thought
on
this
Sunday
,
when
the
place
recall
the
wretch
,
ragged
and
shivering
,
with
his
felon
iron
and
badge
!
<EOS>
My
comfort
be
,
that
it
happen
a
long
time
ago
,
and
that
he
have
doubtless
be
transport
a
long
way
off
,
and
that
he
be
dead
to
me
,
and
may
be
veritably
dead
into
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
no
more
low
wet
ground
,
no
more
dyke
and
sluice
,
no
more
of
these
graze
cattle
---
though
they
seem
,
in
their
dull
manner
,
to
wear
a
more
respectful
air
now
,
and
to
face
round
,
in
order
that
they
may
stare
as
long
as
possible
at
the
possessor
of
such
great
expectation
---
farewell
,
monotonous
acquaintance
of
my
childhood
,
<EOS>
henceforth
I
be
for
London
and
greatness
:
not
for
smith
's
work
in
general
and
for
you
!
<EOS>
I
make
my
exultant
way
to
the
old
Battery
,
and
,
lie
down
there
to
consider
the
question
whether
Miss
Havisham
intend
me
for
Estella
,
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
awoke
,
I
be
much
surprised
to
find
Joe
sit
beside
me
,
smoke
his
pipe
.
<EOS>
He
greet
me
with
a
cheerful
smile
on
my
open
my
eye
,
and
say
:
  
"
<EOS>
as
be
the
last
time
,
Pip
,
I
think
I
would
foller
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
Joe
,
I
be
very
glad
you
do
so
.
"
  
"
Thankee
,
Pip
.
"
  
"
You
may
be
sure
,
dear
Joe
,
"
I
go
on
,
after
we
have
shake
hand
,
"
that
I
shall
never
forget
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
Pip
!
"
say
Joe
,
in
a
comfortable
tone
,
"
I
be
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
old
chap
!
<EOS>
bless
you
,
it
be
only
necessary
to
get
it
well
round
in
a
man
's
mind
,
to
be
certain
on
it
.
<EOS>
but
it
take
a
bit
of
time
to
get
it
well
round
,
the
change
come
so
oncommon
plump
;
do
not
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
somehow
,
I
be
not
best
pleased
with
Joe
's
be
so
mightily
secure
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
like
him
to
have
betray
emotion
,
or
to
have
say
,
"
It
do
you
credit
,
Pip
,
"
or
something
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
I
make
no
remark
on
Joe
's
first
head
:
merely
say
as
to
his
second
,
that
the
tiding
have
indeed
come
suddenly
,
but
that
I
have
always
want
to
be
a
gentleman
,
and
have
often
and
often
speculate
on
what
I
would
do
,
if
I
be
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
though
?
"
say
Joe
.
<EOS>
"
astonish
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
now
,
Joe
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
you
do
not
get
on
a
little
more
,
when
we
have
our
lesson
here
;
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
do
not
know
,
"
return
Joe
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
awful
dull
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
master
of
my
own
trade
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
a
pity
as
I
be
so
awful
dull
;
but
it
be
no
more
of
a
pity
now
,
than
it
be
---
this
day
twelvemonth
---
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
I
have
mean
be
,
that
when
I
come
into
my
property
and
be
able
to
do
something
for
Joe
,
it
would
have
be
much
more
agreeable
if
he
have
be
better
qualify
for
a
rise
in
station
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
perfectly
innocent
of
my
meaning
,
however
,
that
I
think
I
would
mention
it
to
Biddy
in
preference
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
when
we
have
walk
home
and
have
have
tea
,
I
take
Biddy
into
our
little
garden
by
the
side
of
the
lane
,
and
,
after
throw
out
in
a
general
way
for
the
elevation
of
her
spirit
,
that
I
should
never
forget
her
,
say
I
have
a
favour
to
ask
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
it
be
,
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
you
will
not
omit
any
opportunity
of
help
Joe
on
,
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
help
him
on
?
"
ask
Biddy
,
with
a
steady
sort
of
glance
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
Joe
be
a
dear
good
fellow
---
in
fact
,
I
think
he
be
the
dear
fellow
that
ever
live
---
but
he
be
rather
backward
in
some
thing
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
Biddy
,
in
his
learning
and
his
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
although
I
be
look
at
Biddy
as
I
speak
,
and
although
she
open
her
eye
very
wide
when
I
have
speak
,
she
do
not
look
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
his
manner
!
<EOS>
will
not
his
manner
do
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Biddy
,
pluck
a
black

currant
leaf

<EOS>
"
My

Biddy

they
do
very
well
here

oh
!

they

Biddy

look
closely
at
the
leaf
in
her
hand

<EOS>
"
hear
me
out

if
I
be
to
remove
Joe
into
a
high
sphere

as
I
shall
hope
to
remove
him
when
I
fully
come
into

property

they
would
hardly
do
him
justice

<EOS>
"
and
do
not
you
think
he
know
that
?
"
ask
Biddy
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
very
provoking
question
(
for
it
<EOS>
have
never
in
the
most
distant
manner
occur
to
me

,
that
I

,
snappishly

Biddy
have
rub
the
leaf
to
piece

of

ever
since
recall
to
me
that
evening
in

little
garden

I
repeat
,
with
disdainful
emphasis

"

oh
!

there
be
many
kind
of
pride

<EOS>
He
may

proud

him
out
of

place
that
he
be
competent
to
fill
,

well

to
tell

off

whether

poor

depend
upon

Biddy

turn
away
her
head

<EOS>
I
again
warmly
repeat
that
it
be
a
bad
side
of
human
nature
(
in
which
sentiment
,
waive
its
application
,
I
have
since
see
reason
to
think
I
be
right
)
,
and
I
walk
down
the
little
path
away
from
Biddy
,
and
Biddy
go
into
the
house
,
and
I
go
out
at
the
garden
gate
and
take
a
dejected
stroll
until
supper
-
time
;
again
feel
it
very
sorrowful
and
strange
that
this
,
the
second
night
of
my
bright
fortune
,
should
be
as
lonely
and
unsatisfactory
as
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
morning
once
more
brightened
my
view
,
and
I
extend
my
clemency
to
Biddy
,
and
we
drop
the
subject
.
<EOS>
put
on
the
good
clothe
I
have
,
I
go
into
town
as
early
as
I
could
hope
to
find
the
shop
open
,
and
present
myself
before
Mr
Trabb
,
the
tailor
:
who
be
have
his
breakfast
in
the
parlour
behind
his
shop
,
and
who
do
not
think
it
worth
his
while
to
come
out
to
me
,
but
call
me
in
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!

Mr
Trabb

in
a
hail

fellow

well

his
hot
roll
into
three

it
up

orchard

there
be
a
prosperous
iron
safe
let
into
the

I
do
not

bag

Mr

never

deferential
confidence
recommend
it
to
me
as
a
light
article
for
summer
wear

an
article
much
in
vogue

not
do
at
all

"
<EOS>
so
,
Mr
Trabb
measure
and
calculate
me
,
in
the
parlour
,
as
if
I
be
an
estate
and
he
the
fine
specie
of
surveyor
,
and
give
himself
such
a
world
of
trouble
that
I
feel
that
no
suit
of
clothe
could
possibly
remunerate
him
for
his
pain
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
at
last
do
and
have
appoint
to
send
the
article
to
Mr
Pumblechook
's
on
the
Thursday
evening
,
he
say
,
<EOS>
with
his
hand
upon
the
parlour
lock
,
"
I
know
,
sir
,
that
London
gentleman
can
not
be
expect
to
patronize
local
work
,
as
a
rule
;
but
if
you
would
give
me
a
turn
now
and
then
in
the
quality
of
a
townsman
,
I
should
greatly
esteem
it
.
<EOS>
good
morning
,
sir

much
oblige

<EOS>

door

"
  
<EOS>
the
last
word
be
fling
at
the
boy
,
who
have
not
the
least
notion
what
it
mean
.
<EOS>
but
I
see
him
collapse
as
his
master
rub
me
out
with
his
hand
,
and
my
first
decided
experience
of
the
stupendous
power
of
money
,
be
,
that
it
have
morally
lay
upon
his
back
,
Trabb
's
boy
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
memorable
event
,
I
go
to
the
hatter
's
,
and
the
bootmaker
's
,
and
the
hosier
's
,
and
feel
rather
like
Mother
Hubbard
's
dog
whose
outfit
require
the
service
of
so
many
trade
.
<EOS>
I
also
go
to
the
coach
-
office
and
take
my
place
for
seven
o'clock
on
Saturday
morning
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
necessary
to
explain
everywhere
that
I
have
come
into
a
handsome
property
;
but
whenever
I
say
anything
to
that
effect
,
it
follow
that
the
officiate
tradesman
cease
to
have
his
attention
divert
through
the
window
by
the
high
-
street
,
and
concentrate
his
mind
upon
me
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
order
everything
I
want
,
I
direct
my
step
towards
Pumblechook
's
,
and
,
as
I
approach
that
gentleman
's
place
of
business
,
I
see
him
stand
at
his
door
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
wait
for
me
with
great
impatience
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
out
early
with
the
chaise
-
cart
,
and
have
call
at
the
forge
and
hear
the
news
.
<EOS>
He
have
prepare
a
collation
for
me
in
the
Barnwell
parlour
,
and
he
too
order
his
shopman
to
"
come
out
of
the
gangway
"
as
my
sacred
person
pass
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

say
Mr

take
me
by
both

,
when

the
collation
be
alone

"
I

you
joy
of
your
good
fortune

<EOS>
well
deserved
,
well
deserved

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
come
to
the
point
,
and
I
think
it
a
sensible
way
of
express
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
think
,
"
say
Mr
Pumblechook
,
after
snort
admiration
at
me
for
some
moment
,
"
that
I
should
have
be
the
humble
instrument
of
lead
up
to
this

be
a
proud
reward

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
beg
Mr
Pumblechook
to
remember
that
nothing
be
to
be
ever

,
on
that
point

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

Mr
Pumblechook
,
"
if

"
  
I
murmur
"
certainly

"
and
Mr
Pumblechook
take
me
by
both
hand
again
,
and
communicate
a
movement
to
his
waistcoat
,
which
have
an
emotional
appearance
,

it
be
rather
low
down

"
My

compassionate

<EOS>
"

thereupon
he
shake
his

tap
it

express
his
sense
of
deficiency
in
Joseph

<EOS>
"

get
up
again
the

he
shake

again

empty
his

<EOS>
I
do
the

if
I

myself
upside
down

the
wine
could
not

go
more

<EOS>
Mr

help
me
to
the
liver
wing

to
the
good
slice
of
tongue

"
  
<EOS>
It
begin
to
be
unnecessary
to
repeat
the
form
of
say
he
may

so
he
do
it
at
once

<EOS>
how
he
ever

<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
picter

to
reflect
that

be
no

equal
to
fully

the
honour

<EOS>
May

I

be
about

again

I
stop
him

<EOS>
"
We

I.
  
"
ah

"
cry
Mr
Pumblechook
,
lean
back
in
his
chair
,
quite
flaccid
with
admiration
,
"

<EOS>
(
I
do
not

say
the
servile
Pumblechook

put
down
his
untasted
glass
in
a
hurry
and
get
up
again
,
"
to
a
common

have
the
appearance

repeating

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
it
,
he
resume
his
seat
and
drink
to
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
let
us
never
be
blind
,
"
say
Mr
Pumblechook
,
"
to
her
fault
of
temper
,
but
it
be
to
be
hope
she
mean
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
about
this
time
,
I
begin
to
observe
that
he
be
get
flush
in
the
face
;
as
to
myself
,
I
feel
all
face
,
steep
in
wine
and
smarting
.
  
<EOS>
I
mention
to
Mr
Pumblechook
that
I
wish
to
have
my
new
clothe
send
to
his
house
,
and
he
be
ecstatic
on
my
so
distinguish
him
.
<EOS>
I
mention
my
reason
for
desire
to
avoid
observation
in
the
village
,
and
he
laud
it
to
the
sky
.
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
but
himself
,
he
intimate
,
worthy
of
my
confidence
,
and
---
in
short
,
may
he
?
<EOS>
then
he
ask
me
tenderly
if
I
remember
our
boyish
game
at
sum
,
and
how
we
have
go
together
to
have
me
bind
apprentice
,
and
,
in
effect
,
how
he
have
ever
be
my
favourite
fancy
and
my
choose
friend
?
<EOS>
if
I
have
take
ten
time
as
many
glass
of
wine
as
I
have
,
I
should
have
know
that
he
never
have
stand
in
that
relation
towards
me
,
and
should
in
my
head
of
heart
have
repudiate
the
idea
.
<EOS>
yet
for
all
that
,
I
remember
feel
convinced
that
I
have
be
much
mistake
in
him
,
and
that
he
be
a
sensible
practical
good
-
hearted
prime
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
by
degree
he
fall
to
repose
such
great
confidence
in
me
,
as
to
ask
my
advice
in
reference
to
his
own
affair
.
<EOS>
He
mention
that
there
be
an
opportunity
for
a
great
amalgamation
and
monopoly
of
the
corn
and
seed
trade
on
those
premise
,
if
enlarge
,
such
as
have
never
occur
before
in
that
,
or
any
other
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
what
alone
be
want
to
the
realization
of
a
vast
fortune
,
he
consider
to
be
More
capital
.
<EOS>
those
be
the
two
little
word
,
more
capital
.
<EOS>
now
it
appear
to
him
(
Pumblechook
)
that
if
that
capital
be
get
into
the
business
,
through
a
sleep
partner
,
sir
---
which
sleep
partner
would
have
nothing
to
do
but
walk
in
,
by
self
or
deputy
,
whenever
he
please
,
and
examine
the
book
---
and
walk
in
twice
a
year
and
take
his
profit
away
in
his
pocket
,
to
the
tune
of
fifty
per
cent
.
---
it
appear
to
him
that
that
may
be
an
opening
for
a
young
gentleman
of
spirit
combine
with
property
,
which
would
be
worthy
of
his
attention
.
<EOS>
but
what
do
I
think
?
<EOS>
He
have
great
confidence
in
my
opinion
,
and
what
do
I
think
?
<EOS>
I
give
it
as
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
wait
a
bit
!
"
<EOS>
the
united
vastness
and
distinctness
of
this
view
<EOS>
so
strike
him
,
that
he
no
longer
ask
if
he
may
shake
hand
with
me
,
but
say
he
really
must
---
and
do
.
  
<EOS>
We
drink
all
the
wine
,
and
Mr
Pumblechook
pledge
himself
over
and
over
again
to
keep
Joseph
up
to
the
mark
(
I
do
not
know
what
mark
)
,
and
to
render
me
efficient
and
constant
service
(
I
do
not
know
what
service
)
.
<EOS>
He
also
make
known
to
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
and
certainly
after
have
keep
his
secret
wonderfully
well
,
that
he
have
always
say
of
me
,
"
that
boy
be
no
common
boy
,
and
mark
me
,
his
fortun
'
will
be
no
common
fortun
'
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
with
a
tearful
smile
that
it
be
a
singular
thing
to
think
of
now
,
and
I
say
so
too
.
<EOS>
finally
I
go
out
into
the
air
,
with
a
dim
perception
that
there
be
something
unwonted
in
the
conduct
of
the
sunshine
,
and
find
that
I
have
slumberously
get
to
the
turn
-
pike
without
have
take
any
account
of
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
there
,
I
be
rouse
by
Mr
Pumblechook
's
hail
me
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
long
way
down
the
sunny
street
,
and
be
make
expressive
gesture
for
me
to
stop
.
<EOS>
I
stop
,
and
he
come
up
breathless
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
say
he
,
when
he
have
recover
wind
for
speech
.
<EOS>
"
not
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
this
occasion
shall
not
entirely
pass
without
that
affability
on
your
part
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
May
I
,
as
an
old
friend
and
well
-
wisher
?
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
May
\
 
<EOS>
I
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
shake
hand
for
the
hundredth
time
at
least
,
and
he
order
a
young
carter
out
of
my
way
with
the
great
indignation
.
<EOS>
then
,
he
bless
me
and
stand
wave
his
hand
to
me
until
I
have
pass
the
crook
in
the
road
;
and
then
I
turn
into
a
field
and
have
a
long
nap
under
a
hedge
before
I
pursue
my
way
home
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
scant
luggage
to
take
with
me
to
London
,
for
little
of
the
little
I
possess
be
adapt
to
my
new
station
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
begin
pack
that
same
afternoon
,
and
wildly
pack
up
thing
that
I
know
I
should
want
next
morning
,
in
a
fiction
that
there
be
not
a
moment
to
be
lose
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
,
and
Thursday
,
pass
;
and
on
Friday
morning
I
go
to
Mr
Pumblechook
's
,
to
put
on
my
new
clothe
and
pay
my
visit
to
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
's
own
room
be
give
up
to
me
to
dress
in
,
and
be
decorate
with
clean
towel
expressly
for
the
event
.
<EOS>
My
clothe
be
rather
a
disappointment
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
probably
every
new
and
eagerly
expect
garment
ever
put
on
since
clothe
come
in
,
fall
a
trifle
short
of
the
wearer
's
expectation
.
<EOS>
but
after
I
have
have
my
new
suit
on
,
some
half
an
hour
,
and
have
go
through
an
immensity
of
posture
with
Mr
Pumblechook
's
very
limited
dressing
-
glass
,
in
the
futile
endeavour
to
see
my
leg
<EOS>
it
seem
to
fit
me
better
.
<EOS>
It
be
market
morning
at
a
neighbouring
town
some
ten
mile
off
,
Mr
Pumblechook
be
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
tell
him
exactly
when
I
mean
to
leave
,
and
be
not
likely
to
shake
hand
with
him
again
before
depart
.
<EOS>
this
be
all
as
it
should
be
,
and
I
go
out
in
my
new
array
:
fearfully
ashamed
of
have
to
pass
the
shopman
,
and
suspicious
after
all
that
I

countenance
wrung

<EOS>
She
stretch
out
her
hand
,
and
I
go
down
on
my
knee
and
put
it
to
my
lip
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
consider
how
I
should
take
leave
of
her
;
it
come
naturally
to
me
at
the
moment
,
to
do
this
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
Sarah
Pocket
with
triumph
in
her
weird
eye
,
and
so
I
leave
my
fairy
godmother
,
with
both
her
hand
on
her
crutch
stick
,
stand
in
the
midst
of
the
dimly
light
room
beside
the
rotten
bride

cake
that
be
hide
in
cobwebs

<EOS>
Sarah
Pocket
conduct
me
down
,
as
if
I
be
a
ghost
who
must
be
see
out
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
get
over
my
appearance
,
and
be
in
the
last
degree
confound
.
<EOS>
I
say
"
good
-
bye
,
Miss
Pocket
;
"
but
she
merely
stare
,
and
do
not
seem
collect
enough
to
know
that
I
have
speak
.
<EOS>
clear
of
the
house
,
I
make
the
good
of
my
way
back
to
Pumblechook
's
,
take
off
my
new
clothe
,
make
them
into
a
bundle
,
and
go
back
home
in
my
old
dress
,
carry
it
---
to
speak
the
truth
---
much
more
at
my
ease
too
,
though
I
have
the
bundle
to
carry
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
those
six
day
which
be
to
have
run
out
so
slowly
,
have
run
out
fast
and
be
go
,
and
to
-
morrow
look
me
in
the
face
more
steadily
than
I
could
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
as
the
six
evening
have
dwindle
away
,
to
five
,
to
four
,
to
three
,
to
two
,
I
have
become
more
and
more
appreciative
of
the
society
of
Joe
and
Biddy
.
<EOS>
on
this
last
evening
,
I
dress
myself
out
in
my
new
clothe
,
for
their
delight
,
and
sit
in
my
splendour
until
bedtime
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
hot
supper
on
the
occasion
,
grace
by
the
inevitable
roast
fowl
,
and
we
have
some
flip
to
finish
with
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
very
low
,
and
none
the
high
for
pretend
to
be
in
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
to
leave
our
village
at
five
in
the
morning
,
carry
my
little
hand
-
portmanteau
,
and
I
have
tell
Joe
that
I
wish
to
walk
away
all
alone
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
---
sore
afraid
---
that
this
purpose
originate
in
my
sense
of
the
contrast
there
would
be
between
me
and
Joe
,
if
we
go
to
the
coach
together
.
<EOS>
I
have
pretend
with
myself
that
there
be
nothing
of
this
taint
in
the
arrangement
;
but
when
I
go
up
to
my
little
room
on
this
last
night
,
I
feel
compel
to
admit
that
it
may
be
so
,
and
have
an
impulse
upon
me
to
go
down
again
and
entreat
Joe
to
walk
with
me
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
.
  
<EOS>
all
night
there
be
coach
in
my
broken
sleep
,
go
to
wrong
place
instead
of
to
London
,
and
have
in
the
trace
,
now
dog
,
now
cat
,
now
pig
,
now
man
---
never
horse
.
<EOS>
fantastic
failure
of
journey
occupy
me
until
the
day
dawn
and
the
bird
be
singe
.
<EOS>
then
,
I
get
up
and
partly
dress
,
and
sit
at
the
window
to
take
a
last
look
out
,
and
in
take
it
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
Biddy
be
astir
so
early
to
get
my
breakfast
,
that
,
although
I
do
not
sleep
at
the
window
an
hour
,
I
smell
the
smoke
of
the
kitchen
fire
when
I
start
up
with
a
terrible
idea
that
it
must
be
late
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
but
long
after
that
,
and
long
after
I
have
hear
the
clinking
of
the
teacup
and
be
quite
ready
,
I
want
the
resolution
to
go
down
stair
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
remain
up
there
,
repeatedly
unlocking
and
unstrappe
my
small
portmanteau
and
lock
and
strap
it
up
again
,
until
Biddy
call
to
me
that
I
be
late
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
hurried
breakfast
with
no
taste
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
get
up
from
the
meal
,
say
with
a
sort
of
briskness
,
as
if
it
have
only
just
occur
to
me
,
"
well
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
must
be
off
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
I
kiss
my
sister
who
be
laugh
and
nod
and
shake
in
her
usual
chair
,
and
kiss
Biddy
,
and
throw
my
arm
around
Joe
's
neck
.
<EOS>
then
I
take
up
my
little
portmanteau
and
walk
out
.
<EOS>
the
last
I
see
of
them
be
,
when
I
presently
hear
a
scuffle
behind
me
,
and
look
back
,
see
Joe
throw
an
old
shoe
after
me
and
Biddy
throw
another
old
shoe
.
<EOS>
I
stop
then
,
to
wave
my
hat
,
and
dear
old
Joe
wave
his
strong
right
arm
above
his
head
,
cry
huskily
"
Hooroar
!
"
<EOS>
and
Biddy
put
her
apron
to
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
away
at
a
good
pace
,
think
it
be
easy
to
go
than
I
have
suppose
it
would
be
,
and
reflect
that
it
would
never
have
do
to
have
have
an
old
shoe
throw
after
the
coach
,
in
sight
of
all
the
high
-
street
.
<EOS>
I
whistle
and
make
nothing
of
go
.
<EOS>
but
the
village
be
very
peaceful
and
quiet
,
and
the
light
mist
be
solemnly
rise
,
as
if
to
show
me
the
world
,
and
I
have
be
so
innocent
and
little
there
,
and
<EOS>
all
beyond
be
so
unknown
and
great
,
that
in
a
moment
with
a
strong
heave
and
sob
I
break
into
tear
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
the
finger
-
post
at
the
end
of
the
village
,
and
I
lay
my
hand
upon
it
,
and
say
,
"
good
-
bye
<EOS>
o
my
dear
,
dear
friend
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Heaven
know
we
need
never
be
ashamed
of
our
tear
,
for
they
be
rain
upon
the
blind
dust
of
earth
,
overlie
our
hard
heart
.
<EOS>
I
be
well
after
I
have
cry
,
than
before
---
more
sorry
,
more
aware
of
my
own
ingratitude
,
more
gentle
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
cry
before
,
I
should
have
have
Joe
with
me
then
.
  
<EOS>
so
subdued
I
be
by
those
tear
,
and
by
their
breaking
out
again
in
the
course
of
the
quiet
walk
,
that
when
I
be
on
the
coach
,
and
it
be
clear
of
the
town
,
I
deliberate
with
an
ache
heart
whether
I
would
not
get
down
when
we
change
horse
and
walk
back
,
and
have
another
evening
at
home
,
and
a
well
parting
.
<EOS>
We
change
,
and
I
have
not
make
up
my
mind
,
and
still
reflect
for
my
comfort
that
it
would
be
quite
practicable
to
get
down
and
walk
back
,
when
we
change
again
.
<EOS>
and
while
I
be
occupy
with
these
deliberation
,
I
would
fancy
an
exact
resemblance
to
Joe
in
some
man
come
along
the
road
towards
us
,
and
my
heart
would
beat
high
.
<EOS>
---
as
if
he
could
possibly
be
there
!
  
<EOS>
We
change
again
,
and
yet
again
,
and
it
be
now
too
late
and
too
far
to
go
back
,
and
I
go
on
.
<EOS>
and
the
mist
have
all
solemnly
rise
now
,
and
the
world
lie
spread
before
me
.
            
<EOS>
this
be
the
end
of
the
first
stage
of
                     
PIP
'S
expectation
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
20
 
<EOS>
the
journey
from
our
town
to
the
metropolis
,
be
a
journey
of
about
five
hour
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
past
mid
-
day
when
the
four
-
horse
stage
-
coach
by
which
I
be
a
passenger
,
get
into
the
ravel
of
traffic
fray
out
about
the
Cross
Keys
,
Wood
-
street
,
Cheapside
,
London
.
  
<EOS>
We
Britons
have
at
that
time
particularly
settle
that
it
be
treasonable
to
doubt
our
have
and
our
be
the
good
of
everything
:
<EOS>
otherwise
,
while
I
be
scare
by
the
immensity
of
London
,
I
think
I
may
have
have
some
faint
doubt
whether
it
be
not
rather
ugly
,
crooked
,
narrow
,
and
dirty
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
have
duly
send
me
his
address
;
it
be

Little
Britain

and
he
have
write
after
it
on
his
card
,
"
just
out

Smithfield

close
by

office

<EOS>
nevertheless

a
hackney

coachman

who
seem
to
have
as
many
cape
to
his
greasy
great

coat
as
he
be
year
old

pack
me
up
in
his
coach
and
hem
me
in
with
a
fold
and

barrier
of
step

me
fifty

I

decorate
with
an
old

green
hammer
-
cloth
,
moth
-
eat
into
rag

be
quite
a
work
of
time

<EOS>
It
be
a
wonderful
equipage
,
with
six
great
coronet
outside
,
and
rag
thing
behind
for
I
do
not
know
how
many
footman
to
hold
on
by
,
and
a
harrow
below
them
,
to
prevent
amateur
footman
from
yield
to
the
temptation
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
have
time
to
enjoy
the
coach
and
to
think
how
like
a
straw
-
yard
<EOS>
it
be
,
and
yet
how
like
a
rag

shop
,
and
to
wonder
why
the
horse
'
nose
-
bag
be
keep
inside
,
when
I
observe
the
coachman
beginning
to
get
down
,
as
if
we
be
go
to
stop
presently
.
<EOS>
and
stop
we
presently
do
,
in
a
gloomy
street

at
certain
office
with
an
open

whereon
be
paint
MR

<EOS>
"
how
much

<EOS>
"
I
ask
the
coachman

<EOS>
the
coachman
answer
,
"
a
shilling

unless
you
wish
to
make

"
  
<EOS>
I
naturally
say
I
have
no

"
then
it
must

He
darkly
close
an
eye
at
Mr

shake
his

.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
get
his
shilling
,
and
have
in
course
of
time
complete
the
ascent
to
his
box
,
and
have
get
away
(
which
appear
to
relieve
his

)
,
I
go
into
the

office
with
my
little

<EOS>
but
it
stand
to
reason
his
time
be
valuable
,
that
he
will
not
be
long
than
he
can
help
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
those
word
,
the
clerk
open
a
door
,
and
usher
me
into
an
inner
chamber
at
the
back
.
<EOS>
here
,
we
find
a
gentleman
with
one
eye
,
in
a
velveteen
suit
and
knee
-
breech
,
who
wipe
his
nose
with
his
sleeve
on
be
interrupt
in
the
perusal
of
the
newspaper
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
and
wait
outside
,
Mike
,
"
say
the
clerk
.
  
<EOS>
I
begin
to
say
that
I
hope
I
be
not
interrupting
---
when
the
clerk
shove
this
gentleman
out
with
as
little
ceremony
as
I
ever
see
use
,
and
toss
his
fur
cap
out
after
him
,
leave
me
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
's
room
be
light
by
a
skylight
only
,
and
be
a
most
dismal
place
;
the
skylight
,
eccentrically
patch
like
a
broken
head
,
and
the
distort
adjoining
house
look
as
if
they
have
twist
themselves
to
peep
down
at
me
through
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
so
many
paper
about
,
as
I
should
have
expect
to
see
;
and
there
be
some
odd
object
about
,
that
I
should
not
have
expect
to
see
---
such
as
an
old
rusty
pistol
,
a
sword
in
a
scabbard
,
several
strange
-
looking
box
and
package
,
and
two
dreadful
cast
on
a
shelf
,
of
face
peculiarly
swollen
,
and
twitchy
about
the
nose
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
's
own
high
-
back
chair
be
of
deadly
black
horse
-
hair
,
with
row
of
brass
nail
round
it
,
like
a
coffin
;
and
I
fancy
I
could
see
how
he
lean
back
in
it
,
and
bite
his
forefinger
at
the
client
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
but
small
,
and
the
client
seem
to
have
have
a
habit
of
back
up
against
the
wall
:
the
wall
,
especially
opposite
to
Mr
Jaggers
's
chair
,
be
greasy
with
shoulder
.
<EOS>
I
recall
,
too
,
that
the
one
-
eye
gentleman
have
shuffle
forth
against
the
wall
when
I
be
the
innocent
cause
of
his
be
turn
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
sit
down
in
the
cliental
chair
place
over
against
Mr
Jaggers
's
chair
,
and
become
fascinated
by
the
dismal
atmosphere
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
I
call
to
mind
that
the
clerk
have
the
same
air
of
know
something
to
everybody
else
's
disadvantage
,
as
his
master
have
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
many
other
clerk
there
be
up
-
stair
,
and
whether
they
all
claim
to
have
the
same
detrimental
mastery
of
their
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
be
the
history
of
all
the
odd
litter
about
the
room
,
and
how
it
come
there
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
the
two
swollen
face
be
of
Mr
Jaggers
's
family
,
and
,
if
he
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
have
a
pair
of
such
ill
-
look
relation
,
why
he
stick
them
on
that
dusty
perch
for
the
black
and
fly
to
settle
on
,
instead
of
give
them
a
place
at
home
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
have
no
experience
of
a
London
summer
day
,
and
my
spirit
may
have
be
oppress
by
the
hot
exhausted
air
,
and
by
the
dust
and
grit
that
lie
thick
on
everything
.
<EOS>
but
I
sit
wonder
and
wait
in
Mr
Jaggers
's
close
room
,
until
I
really
could
not
bear
the
two
cast
on
the
shelf
above
Mr
Jaggers
's
chair
,
and
get
up
and
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
tell
the
clerk
that
I
would
take
a
turn
in
the
air
while
I
wait
,
he
advise
me
to
go
round
the
corner
<EOS>
and
I
should
come
into
Smithfield
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
come
into
Smithfield
;
and
the
shameful
place
,
be
all
asmear
with
filth
and
fat
and
blood
and
foam
,
seem
to
stick
to
me
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
rub
it
off
with
all
possible
speed
by
turn
into
a
street
where
I
see
the
great
black
dome
of
Saint
Paul
's
bulging
at
me
from
behind
a
grim
stone
building
which
a
bystander
say
be
Newgate
Prison
.
<EOS>
follow
the
wall
of
the
jail
,
I
find
the
roadway
cover
with
straw
to
deaden
the
noise
of
pass
vehicle
;
and
from
this
,
and
from
the
quantity
of
people
stand
about
,
smell
strongly
of
spirit
and
beer
,
I
infer
that
the
trial
be
on
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
look
about
me
here
,
an
exceedingly
dirty
and
partially
drunk
minister
of
justice
ask
me
if
I
would
like
to
step
in
and
hear
a
trial
or
so
:
inform
me
that
he
could
give
me
a
front
place
for
half
-
a
-
crown
,
whence
<EOS>
I
should
command
a
full
view
of
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
in
his
wig
and
robe
---
mention
that
awful
personage
like
waxwork
,
and
presently
offer
him
at
the
reduce
price
of
eighteenpence
.
<EOS>
as
I
decline
the
proposal
on
the
plea
of
an
appointment
,
he
be
so
good
as
to
take
me
into
a
yard
and
show
me
where
the
gallow
be
keep
,
and
also
where
people
be
publicly
whip
,
and
then
he
show
me
the
Debtors
'
Door
,
out
of
which
culprit
come
to
be
hang
:
heighten
the
interest
of
that
dreadful
portal
by
give
me
to
understand
that
"
four
on
'em
"
would
come
out
at
that
door
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
at
eight
in
the
morning
,
to
be
kill
in
a
row
.
<EOS>
this
be
horrible
,
and
give
me
a
sickening
idea
of
London
:
the
more
so
as
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
's
proprietor
wear
(
from
his
hat
down
to
his
boot
and
up
again
to
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
inclusive
)
<EOS>
mildew
clothe
,
which
have
evidently
not
belong
to
him
originally
,
and
which
,
I
take
it
into
my
head
<EOS>
,
he
have
buy
cheap
of
the
executioner
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
I
think
myself
well
rid
of
him
for
a
shilling
.
  
<EOS>
I
drop
into
the
office
to
ask
if
Mr
Jaggers
have
come
in
yet
,
and
I
find
he
have
not
,
and
I
stroll
out
again
.
<EOS>
this
time
,
I
make
the
tour
of
Little
Britain
,
and
turn
into
Bartholomew
Close
;
and
now
I
become
aware
that
other
people
be
wait
about
for
Mr
Jaggers
,
as
well
as
I.
<EOS>
there
be
two
man
of
secret
appearance
lounge
in
Bartholomew
Close
,
and
thoughtfully
fit
their
foot
into
the
crack
of
the
pavement
as
they
talk
together
,
one
of
whom
say
to
the
other
when
they
first
pass
me
,
that
"
jagger
would
do
it
if
it
be
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
knot
of
three
man
and
two
woman
stand
at
a
corner
,
and
one
of
the
woman
be
cry
on
her
dirty
shawl
,
and
the
other
comfort
her
by
say
as
she
pull
her
own
shawl
over
her
shoulder
,
"
Jaggers
be
for
him
,
'
Melia
,
and
what
more
 
\
could
\
 
you
have
?
"
there
be
a
red
-
eyed
little
Jew
who
come
into
the
close
while
I
be
loiter
there
,
in
company
with
a
second
little
Jew
whom
he
send
upon
an
errand
;
and
while
the
messenger
be
go
,
I
remark
this
Jew
,
who
be
of
a
highly
excitable
temperament
,
perform
a
jig
of
anxiety
under
a
lamp
-
post
,
and
accompany
himself
,
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
,
with
the
word
,
"

,

!
<EOS>
all

"
<EOS>
these
testimony
to
the
popularity
of
my
guardian
make
a
deep
impression
on
me
,
and
I
admire
and
wonder
more
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
as
I
be
look
out
at
the
iron
gate
of
Bartholomew
Close
into
Little
Britain
,
I
see
Mr
Jaggers
come
across
the
road
towards
me
.
<EOS>
all
the
other
who
be
wait
,
see
him
at
the
same
time
,
and
there
be
quite
a
rush
at
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
,
put
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
walk
me
on
at

side
without

one
of

man

submissively
,
while
the

peruse
Mr

You

the

look
scared

bewilder
too
,
as

be
unconscious
what
he
have
do

in

give

a

"

Mike
look

a

from

slowly

"
now

be
careful

in

<EOS>
Mike
look
at
his
cap
,
and
look
at
the
floor
,
and
look
at
the
ceiling
,
and
look
at
the

even
look
at
me
,
before
begin
to
reply
in

nervous
manner
,

out

You
WILL

<EOS>
(

add
the

again
,
with
another
stir

<EOS>
after
some
helpless
casting
about
,
Mike
brighten
and
begin
again
:
  
<EOS>
"
He

<EOS>
"
be
he
here
?
"
ask
my
guardian
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
leave
him
,
"
say
Mike
,
"
a
setting
on
some
doorstep
round
the
corner

"
  
<EOS>
"

see
him

"
  
<EOS>
the
window
indicate
,
be
the
office
window
.
<EOS>
We
all
three
go
to
it
,
behind
the
wire
blind
,
and
presently
see
the
client
go
by
in
an
accidental
manner
,
with
a
murderous
-
look
tall
individual
,
in
a
short
suit
of
white
linen
and
a
paper
cap
.
<EOS>
this
guileless
confectioner
be
not
by
any
mean
sober
,
and
have
a
black
eye
in
the
green
stage
of
recovery
,
which
be
paint
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
him
to
take
his
witness
away
directly
,
"
say
my
guardian
to
the
clerk
,
in
extreme
disgust
,
"
and
ask
him
what
he
mean
by
bring
such
a
fellow
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
guardian
then
take
me
into
his
own
room
,
and
while
he
lunch
,
stand
,
from
a
sandwich
-
box
and
a
pocket
flask
of
sherry
<EOS>
(
he
seem
to
bully
his
very
sandwich
as
he
eat
it
)
,
inform
me
what
arrangement
he
have
make
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
go
to
"
Barnard
's
Inn
,
"
to
young
Mr
Pocket
's
room
,
where
a
bed
have
be
send
in
for
my
accommodation
;
I
be
to
remain
with
young
Mr
Pocket
until
Monday
;
on
Monday
I
be
to
go
with
him
to
his
father
's
house
on
a
visit
,
that
I
may
try
how
I
like
it
.
<EOS>
also
,
I
be
tell
what
my
allowance
be
to
be
---
it
be
a
very
liberal
one
---
and
have
hand
to
me
from
one
of
my
guardian
's
drawer
,
the
card
of
certain
tradesman
with
whom
I
be
to
deal
for
all
kind
of
clothe
,
and
such
other
thing
as
I
could
in
reason
want
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
your
credit
good
,
Mr
Pip
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
whose
flask
of
sherry
smelt
like
a
whole
cask
-
full
,
as
he
hastily
refresh
himself
,
"
but
I
shall
by
this
mean
be
able
to
check
your
bill
,
and
to
pull
you
up
if
I
find
you
outrun
the
constable
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
will
go
wrong
somehow
,
but
that
be
no
fault
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
ponder
a
little
over
this
encouraging
sentiment
,
I
ask
Mr
Jaggers
if
I
could
send
for
a
coach
?
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
not
worth
<EOS>
while
,
I
be
so
near
my
destination
;
Wemmick
should
walk
round
with
me
,
if
I
please
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
find
that
Wemmick
be
the
clerk
in
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
another
clerk
be
ring
down
from
up
-
stair
to
take
his
place
while
he
be
out
,
and
I
accompany
him
into
the
street
,
after
shake
hand
with
my
guardian
.
<EOS>
We
find
a
new
set
of
people
linger
outside
,
but
Wemmick
make
a
way
among
them
by
say
coolly
yet
decisively
,
"
I
tell
you
it
be
no
use
;
he
will
not
have
a
word
to
say
to
one
of
you
;
"
and
we
soon
get
clear
of
them
,
and
go
on
side
by
side
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
21
 
cast
my
eye
on
Mr
Wemmick
as
we
go
along
,
to
see
what
he
be
like
in
the
light
of
day
<EOS>
,
I
find
him
to
be
a
dry
man
,
rather
short
in
stature
,
with
a
square
wooden
face
,
whose
expression
seem
to
have
be
imperfectly
chip
out
with
a
dull
-
edge
chisel
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
mark
in
it
that
may
have
be
dimple
,
if
the
material
have
be
soft
and
the
instrument
finer
,
but
which
,
as
it
be
,
be
only
dint
.
<EOS>
the
chisel
have
make
three
or
four
of
these
attempt
at
embellishment
over
his
nose
,
but
have
give
them
up
without
an
effort
to
smooth
them
off
.
<EOS>
I
judge
him
to
be
a
bachelor
from
the
fray
condition
of
his
linen
,
and
he
appear
to
have
sustain
a
good
many
bereavement
;
for
,
he
wear
at
least
four
mourning
ring
,
besides
a
brooch
represent
a
lady
and
a
weeping
willow
at
a
tomb
with
an
urn
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
notice
,
too
,
that
several
ring
and
seal
hang
at
his
watch
chain
,
as
if
he
be
quite
laden
with
remembrance
of
depart
friend
.
<EOS>
He
have
glitter
eye
---
small
,
keen
,
and
black
---
and
thin
wide
mottle
lip
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
them
,
to
the
good
of
my
belief
,
from
forty
to
fifty
year
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
be
never
in
London
before
?
"
say
Mr
Wemmick
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
new
here
once
,
"
say
Mr
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
rum
to
think
of
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
well
acquainted
with
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
yes
,
"
say
Mr
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
move
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
a
very
wicked
place
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
more
for
the
sake
of
say
something
than
for
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
get
cheat
,
rob
,
and
murder
,
in
London
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
plenty
of
people
anywhere
,
who
will
do
that
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
bad
blood
between
you
and
them
,
"
say
I
,
to
soften
it
off
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
about
bad
blood
,
"
return
Mr
Wemmick
;
"
there
be
not
much
bad
blood
about
.
<EOS>
They
will
do
it
,
if
there
be
anything
to
be
get
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
make
it
bad

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
?
"
return
Mr
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
much
about
the
same
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
wear
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
,
and
look
straight
before
him
:
walk
in
a
self
-
contain
way
as
if
there
be
nothing
in
the
street
to
claim
his
attention
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
be
such
a
post
-
office
of
a
mouth
that
he
have
a
mechanical
appearance
of
smile
.
<EOS>
We
have
get
to
the
top
of
Holborn
Hill
before
I
know
that
it
be
merely
a
mechanical
appearance
,
and
that
he
be
not
smile
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
where
Mr
Matthew
Pocket
live
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
Mr
Wemmick
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
,
nod
in
the
direction
.
<EOS>
"
at
Hammersmith
,
west
of
London

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
far

"
  
"
<EOS>
well

<EOS>
say
five
mile

"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
be
a
regular
cross
-
examiner

"
say
Mr
Wemmick
,
look
at
me
with
an
approve
air
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
know
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
an
air
of
toleration
or
depreciation
about
his
utterance
of
these
word
,
that
rather
depress
me
;
and
I
be
still
look
sideways
at
his
block
of
a
face
in
search
of
any
encouraging
note
to
the
text
,
when
he
say
here
we
be
at
Barnard
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
My
depression
be
not
alleviate
by
the
announcement
,
for
<EOS>
,
I
have
suppose
that
establishment
to
be
an
hotel
keep
by
Mr
Barnard
,
to
which
the
Blue
Boar
in
our
town
be
a
mere
public
-
house
.
<EOS>
whereas
I
now
find
Barnard
to
be
a
disembodied
spirit
,
or
a
fiction
,
and
his
inn
the
dingy
collection
of
shabby
building
ever
squeeze
together
in
a
rank
corner
as
a
club
for
Tom
-
cat
.
  
<EOS>
We
enter
this
haven
through
a
wicket
-
gate
,
and
be
disgorge
by
an
introductory
passage
into
a
melancholy
little
square
that
look
to
me
like
a
flat
burying
-
ground
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
have
the
most
dismal
tree
in
it
,
and
the
most
dismal
sparrow
,
and
the
most
dismal
cat
,
and
the
most
dismal
house
(
in
number
half
a
dozen
or
so
)
,
that
I
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
window
of
the
set
of
chamber
into
which
those
house
be
divide
,
be
in
every
stage
of
dilapidated
blind
and
curtain
,
crippled
flower
-
pot
,
crack
glass
,
dusty
decay
,
and
miserable
makeshift
;
while
to
let
to
let
to
let
,
glare
at
me
from
empty
room
,
as
if
no
new
wretch
ever
come
there
,
and
the
vengeance
of
the
soul
of
Barnard
be
be
slowly
appease
by
the
gradual
suicide
of
the
present
occupant
and
their
unholy
interment
under
the
gravel
.
<EOS>
a
frouzy
mourning
of
soot
and
smoke
attire
this
forlorn
creation
of
Barnard
and
it
have
strew
ashe
on
its
head
,
and
be
undergo
penance
and
humiliation
as
a
mere
dust
-
hole
.
<EOS>
thus
far
my
sense
of
sight
;
while
dry
rot
and
wet
rot
and
all
the
silent
rot
that
rot
in
neglect
roof
and
cellar
---
rot
of
rat
and
mouse
and
bug
and
coaching
-
stable
near
at
hand
besides
---
address
themselves
faintly
to
my
sense
of
smell
,
and
moan
,
"
try
Barnard
's
Mixture
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
imperfect
be
this
realization
of
the
first
of
my
great
expectation
,
that
I
look
in
dismay
at
Mr
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
"
say
he
,
mistake
me
;
"
the
retirement
remind
you
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
so
it
do
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
lead
me
into
a
corner
and
conduct
me
up
a
flight
of
stair
---
which
appear
to
me
to
be
slowly
collapse
into
sawdust
,
so
that
one
of
those
day
the
upper
lodger
would
look
out
at
their
door
and
find
themselves
without
the
mean
of
come
down
---
to
a
set
of
chamber
on
the
top
floor
.
<EOS>
MR

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
hardly
think
you
would
come
so
soon

Mr

explain

<EOS>
"
You
do
not
want
me
any
more

"
no

<EOS>
"
good

<EOS>
I
put
out
my
hand
,
and
Mr
Wemmick
at
first
look
at
it
as
if
he
think
I
want
something
.
<EOS>
then
he
look
at
me
,
and
say
,
correct
himself
,
  
"
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
You
be
in
the
habit
of
shake
hand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
rather
confused
,
think
it
must
be
out
of
the
London
fashion
,
but
say
yes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
so
out
of
it

say
Mr

"
except
at
last

<EOS>
very
glad

I
be
sure

to
make
your

<EOS>
good
day

"
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
shake
hand
and
he
be
go
,
I
open
the
staircase
window
and
have
nearly
behead
myself
,
for
,
the
line
have
rot
away
,
and
it
come
down
like
the
guillotine
.
<EOS>
happily
it
be
so
quick
that
I
have
not
put
my
head
out
.
<EOS>
after
this
escape
,
I
be
content
to
take
a
foggy
view
of
the
Inn
through
the
window
's
encrust
dirt
,
and
to
stand
dolefully
look
out
,
say
to
myself
that
London
be
decidedly
overrate
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Pocket
,
Junior
's
,
idea
of
Shortly
be
not
mine
,
for
I
have
nearly
madden
myself
with
look
out
for
half
an
hour
,
and
have
write
my
name
with
my
finger
several
time
in
the
dirt
of
every
pane
in
the
window
,
before
I
hear
footstep
on

He

a
paper

I
be
extremely
sorry

I
know
there
be
a
coach
from
your

I

you
would
come
by
that
one

the
fact

I
have
be
out
on
your

like
a
little
fruit
after
dinner
,

I
go
to
Covent
Garden
Market
to
get
it
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
a
reason
that
I
have
,
I
feel
as
if
my
eye
would
start
out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
his
attention
incoherently
,

begin
to
think
this
be
a
dream

fast

jam
of
his

by
wrestle
with
the
door

the
paper

bag
be
under

I
beg
him
to
allow
me
to
hold
them

He
relinquish
them
with
an
agreeable
smile
,
and
combat
with
the
door
as
if
it
be
a
wild
beast
.
<EOS>
It
yield
so
suddenly
at
last
,
that
he
stagger
back
upon
me
,
and
I
stagger
back
upon
the
opposite
door
,
and
we
both
laugh
.
<EOS>

still
I
feel
as
if
my
eye
must
start
out
of

as

this
must
be
a

I

I

you
will
be
able
to
make
out
tolerably
well
till
Monday

My
father
think
you
would
get
on
more
agreeably
through

morrow
with
me

with
him

may
like
to
take
a
walk
about
London

I
be
sure
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
show
London
to
you

you
will
not
find
that
bad
,

(
it

right
<EOS>
I
should
add
)
at
your
expense

<EOS>
such
be
Mr
Jaggers
's
direction
.
<EOS>
as
to
our
lodging
,
it
be
not
by
any
mean
splendid
,
because
I
have
my
own
bread
to
earn
,
and
my
father
have
not
anything
to
give
me
,
and
I
should
not
be
willing
to
take
it
,
if
he
have
.
<EOS>
this
be
our
sitting

room
---
just
such
chair
and
table
and
carpet

so
forth
,
you
see

as
they
could
spare
from

<EOS>
You
must
not

me
credit

they
come
for
you
from
the
coffee

this

my
little

rather
musty

Barnard

musty

this

your

the

I

it

answer

<EOS>
as
I
stand
opposite

deliver
him
the
bag

one

two

I
see
the
start
appearance
come
into
his

I

,
fall
back

Chapter
22
 
the
pale
young
gentleman
<EOS>
and
I
stand
contemplate
one
another
in
Barnard
's
Inn
,
until
we
both
burst
out
laugh

laugh
again

<EOS>
"

well

the
pale

reach
out

good

humouredly

it

all
over

magnanimous
in
you

you
will
forgive
me
for
have
knock
you
about
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
derive
from
this
speech
that
Mr
Herbert
Pocket
(
for
Herbert
be
the
pale
young
gentleman
's
name
)
<EOS>
still
rather
confound
his
intention
with
his
execution
.
<EOS>
but
I
make
a
modest
reply
,
and
we
shake
hand
warmly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
come
into
your
good
fortune
at

time

Herbert

<EOS>
"
no

no

he
acquiesce

happen
very
lately

I
be
rather
on
the
look

out
for

fortune
then

"
  
"
indeed
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
have
send
for
me
,
to
see
if

a
fancy

<EOS>
but
she
could
not
---
at
all
event

she
do
not

<EOS>
I
think
it
polite
to
remark
that
I
be
surprised
to
hear
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dad

a
fact

<EOS>
yes

she
have
send
for
me
on

trial
visit

and
if
I
have
come
out

I
suppose
I
should

me
take
the
liberty

question

day

<EOS>
I
tell

,
and
he
be
attentive
until
I
have
finish
,
and
then
burst
out
laugh
again

ask
me
if
I
be
sore
afterwards

<EOS>
I
do
not

him

,
for
my

point

perfectly
establish

Mr

I
understand
?

"
he
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
he
be
Miss
Havisham

man
of
business
and
solicitor

have
her
confidence
when
nobody
else
have
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
bring
me
(
I
feel
)
towards
dangerous
ground
.
<EOS>
I
answer
with
a
constraint
I
make
no
attempt
to
disguise
,
that
I
have
see
Mr
Jaggers
in
Miss
Havisham
's
house
on
the
very
day
of
our
combat
,
but
never
at
any
other
time
,
and
that
I
believe
he
have
no
recollection
of
have
ever
see
me
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
so
obliging
as
to
suggest
my
father
for
your
tutor
,
and
he
call
on
my
father
to
propose
it
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
know
about
my
father
from
his
connexion
with
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
Miss
Havisham
's
cousin
;
not
that
that
imply
familiar
intercourse
between
them
,
for
he
be
a
bad
courtier
and
will
not
propitiate
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Herbert
Pocket
have
a
frank
and
easy
way
with
him
that
be
very
take
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
any
one
then
,
and
I
have
never
see
any
one
since
,
who
more
strongly
express
to
me
,
in
every
look
and
tone
,
a
natural
incapacity
to
do
anything
secret
and
mean
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
wonderfully
hopeful
about
his
general
air
,
and
something
that
at
the
same
time
whisper
to
me
<EOS>
he
would
never
be
very
successful
or
rich
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
this
be
.
<EOS>
I
become
imbued
with
the
notion
on
that
first
occasion
before
we
sit
down
to
dinner
,
but
I
can
not
define
by
what
mean
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
still
a
pale
young
gentleman
,
and
have
a
certain
conquer
languor
about
him
in
the
midst
of
his
spirit
and
briskness
,
that
do
not
seem
indicative
of
natural
strength
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
a
handsome
face
,
but
it
be
well
than
handsome
:
be
extremely
amiable
and
cheerful
.
<EOS>
His
figure
be
a
little
ungainly
,
as
in
the
day
when
my
knuckle
have
take
such
liberty
with
it
,
but
it
look
as
if
it
would
always
be
light
and
young
.
<EOS>
whether
Mr
Trabb
's
local
work
would
have
sit
more
gracefully
on
him
than
on
me
,
may
be
a
question
;
but
I
be
conscious
that
he
carry
off
his
rather
old
clothe
,
much
well
than
I
carry
off
my
new
suit
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
be
so
communicative
,
I
feel
that
reserve
on
my
part
would
be
a
bad
return
unsuited
to
our
year
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
tell
him
my
small
story
,
and
lay
stress
on
my
be
forbid
to
inquire
who
my
benefactor
be
.
<EOS>
I
further
mention
that
as
I
have
be
bring
up
a
blacksmith
in
a
country
place
,
and
know
very
little
of
the
way
of
politeness
,
I
would
take
it
as
a
great
kindness
in
him
if
he
would
give
me
a
hint
whenever
he
see
me
at
a
loss
or
go
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
with
pleasure
,
"
say
he
,
"
though
I
venture
to
prophesy
that
you
will
want
very
few
hint
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
we
shall
be
often
together
,
and
I
should
like
to
banish
any
needless
restraint
between
us
.
<EOS>
Will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
begin
at
once
to
call
me
by
my
christian
name
,
Herbert
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thank
him
,
and
say
I
would
.
<EOS>
I
inform
him
in
exchange
that
my
christian
name
be
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
take
to
Philip
,
"
say
he
,
smile
,
"
for
it
<EOS>
sound
like
a
moral
boy
out
of
the
spelling
-
book
,
who
be
so
lazy
that
he
fall
into
a
pond
,
or
so
fat
that
he
could
not
see
out
of
his
eye
,
or
so
avaricious
that
he
lock
up
his
cake
till
the
mouse
eat
it
,
or
so
determined
to
go
a
bird's
-
nest
that
he
get
himself
eat
by
bear
who
live
handy
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
I
should
like
.
<EOS>
We
be
so
harmonious
,
and
you
have
be
a
blacksmith
---
<EOS>
would
you
mind
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
mind
anything
that
you
propose
,
"
I
answer
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
understand
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
mind
Handel
for
a
familiar
name
?
<EOS>
there
be
a
charming
piece
of
music
by
Handel
,
call
the
Harmonious
Blacksmith
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
my
dear
Handel
,
"
say
he
,
turn
round
as
the
door
open
,
"
here
be
the
dinner
,
and
I
must
beg
of
you
to
take
the
top
of
the
table
,
because
the
dinner
be
of
your
providing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
I
would
not
hear
of
,
so
he
take
the
top
,
and
I
face
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
nice
little
dinner
---
seem
to
me
then
,
a
very
Lord
Mayor
's
Feast
---
and
it
acquire
additional
relish
from
be
eat
under
those
independent
circumstance
,
with
no
old
people
by
,
and
with
London
all
around
us
.
<EOS>
this
again
be
heighten
by
a
certain
gipsy
character
that
set
the
banquet
off
;
for
,
while
the
table
be
,
as
Mr
Pumblechook
may
have
say
,
the
lap
of
luxury
---
be
entirely
furnish
forth
from
the
coffee
-
house
---
<EOS>
the
circumjacent
region
of
sitting
-
room
be
of
a
comparatively
pastureless
and
shifty
character
:
impose
on
the
waiter
the
wander
habit
of
put
the
cover
on
the
floor
(
where
he
fall
over
them
)
,
the
melt
butter
in
the
armchair
,
the
bread
on
the
bookshelf
,
the
cheese
in
the
coal
-
scuttle
,
and
the
boil
fowl
into
my
bed
in
the
next
room
---
where
I
find
much
of
its
parsley
and
butter
in
a
state
of
congelation
when
I
retire
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
all
this
make
the
feast
delightful
,
and
when
the
waiter
be
not
there
to
watch
me
,
my
pleasure
be
without
alloy
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
make
some
progress
in
the
dinner
,
when
I
remind
Herbert
of
his
promise
to
tell
me
about
Miss
Havisham
.
  
<EOS>
"
true
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
redeem
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
let
me
introduce
the
topic
,
Handel
,
by
mention
that
in
London
it
be
not
the
custom
to
put
the
knife
in
the
mouth
---
for
fear
of
accident
---
and
that
while
the
fork
be
reserve
for
that
use
,
it
be
not
put
further
in
than
necessary
.
<EOS>
It
be
scarcely
worth
mention
,
only
it
be
as
well
to
do
as
other
people
do
.
<EOS>
also
,
the
spoon
be
not
generally
use
over
-
hand
,
but
under
.
<EOS>
this
have
two
advantage
.
<EOS>
You
get
at
your
mouth
better
(
which
after
all
be
the
object
)
,
and
you
save
a
good
deal
of
the
attitude
of
open
oyster
,
on
the
part
of
the
right
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
offer
these
friendly
suggestion
in
such
a
lively
way
,
that
we
both
laugh
and
I
scarcely
blush
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
he
pursue
,
"
concern
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
,
you
must
know
,
be
a
spoilt
child
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
die
when
she
be
a
baby
,
and
her
father
deny
her
nothing
.
<EOS>
Her
father
be
a
country
gentleman
down
in
your
part
of
the
world
,
and
be
a
brewer
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
it
should
be
a
crack
thing
to
be
a
brewer
;
but
it
be
indisputable
that
while
you
can
not
possibly
be
genteel
and
bake
,
you
may
be
as
genteel
as
never
be
and
brew
.
<EOS>
You
see
it
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yet
a
gentleman
may
not
keep
a
public
-
house
;
may
he
?
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
not
on
any
account
,
"
return
Herbert
;
"
but
a
public
-
house
may
keep
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
Mr
Havisham
be
very
rich
and
very
proud
.
<EOS>
so
be
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Havisham
be
an
only
child
?
"
I
hazard
.
  
<EOS>
"
stop
a
moment
,
I
be
come
to
that
.
<EOS>
no
,
she
be
not
an
only
child
;
she
have
a
half
-
brother
.
<EOS>
Her
father
privately
marry
again
---
his
cook
,
I
rather
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
be
proud
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
Handel
,
so
he
be
.
<EOS>
He
marry
his
second
wife
privately
,
because
he
be
proud
,
and
in
course
of
time
 
\
she
\
 
die
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
dead
,
I
apprehend
he
first
tell
his
daughter
what
he
have
do
,
and
then
the
son
become
a
part
of
the
family
,
reside
in
the
house
you
be
acquaint
with
.
<EOS>
as
the
son
grow
a
young
man
,
he
turn
out
riotous
,
extravagant
,
undutiful
---
altogether
bad
.
<EOS>
at
last
his
father
disinherit
him
;
but
he
soften
when
he
be
die
,
and
leave
him
well
off
,
though
not
nearly
so
well
off
as
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
---
take
another
glass
of
wine
,
and
excuse
my
mentioning
that
society
as
a
body
do
not
expect
one
to
be
so
strictly
conscientious
in
empty
one
's
glass
,
as
to
turn
it
bottom
upwards
with
the
rim
on
one
's
nose
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
do
this
,
in
an
excess
of
attention
to
his
recital
.
<EOS>
I
thank
him
,
and
apologize
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
not
at
all
,
"
and
resume
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Havisham
be
now
an
heiress
,
and
you
may
suppose
be
look
after
as
a
great
match
.
<EOS>
Her
half
-
brother
have
now
ample
mean
again
,
but
what
with
debt
and
what
with
new
madness
waste
them
most
fearfully
again
.
<EOS>
there
be
strong
difference
between
him
and
her
,
than
there
have
be
between
him
and
his
father
,
and
it
be
suspect
that
he
cherish
a
deep
and
mortal
grudge
against
her
,
as
have
influence
the
father
's
anger
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
come
to
the
cruel
part
of
the
story
---
merely
break
off
,
my
dear
Handel
,
to
remark
that
a
dinner
-
napkin
will
not
go
into
a
tumbler
.
"
  
<EOS>
why
I
be
try
to
pack
mine
into
my
tumbler
,
I
be
wholly
unable
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
I
find
myself
,
with
a
perseverance
worthy
of
a
much
well
cause
,
make
the
most
strenuous
exertion
to
compress
it
within
those
limit
.
<EOS>
again
I
thank
him
and
apologize
,
and
again
he
say
in
the
cheerfullest
manner
,
"
not
at
all
,
I
be
sure
!
"
and
resume
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
appear
upon
the
scene
---
say
at
the
race
,
or
the
public
ball
,
or
anywhere
else
you
like
---
a
certain
man
,
who
make
love
to
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
him
,
for
this
happen
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
ago
(
before
you
and
I
be
,
Handel
)
,
but
I
have
hear
my
father
mention
that
he
be
a
showy
-
man
,
and
the
kind
of
man
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
but
that
he
be
not
to
be
,
without
ignorance
or
prejudice
,
mistake
for
a
gentleman
,
my
father
most
strongly
asseverate
;
because
it
be
a
principle
of
his
that
no
man
who
be
not
a
true
gentleman
at
heart
,
ever
be
,
since
the
world
begin
,
a
true
gentleman
in
manner
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
no
varnish
can
hide
the
grain
of
the
wood
;
and
that
the
more
varnish
you
put
on
,
the
more
the
grain
will
express
itself
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
this
man
pursue
Miss
Havisham
closely
,
and
profess
to
be
devoted
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
have
not
show
much
susceptibility
up
to
that
time
;
but
all
the
susceptibility
she
possess
,
certainly
come
out
then
,
and
she
passionately
love
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
that
she
perfectly
idolize
him
.
<EOS>
He
practise
on
her
affection
in
that
systematic
way
,
that
he
get
great
sum
of
money
from
her
,
and
he
induce
her
to
buy
her
brother
out
of
a
share
in
the
brewery
(
which
have
be
weakly
leave
him
by
his
father
)
at
an
immense
price
,
on
the
plea
that
when
he
be
her
husband
he
must
hold
and
manage
it
all
.
<EOS>
Your
guardian
be
not
at
that
time
in
Miss
Havisham
's
council
,
and
she
be
too
haughty
and
too
much
in
love
,
to
be
advise
by
any
one
.
<EOS>
Her
relation
be
poor
and
scheme
,
with
the
exception
of
my
father
;
he
be
poor
enough
,
but
not
time
-
serve
or
jealous
.
<EOS>
the
only
independent
one
among
them
,
he
warn
her
that
she
be
do
too
much
for
this
man
,
and
be
place
herself
too
unreservedly
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
She
take
the
first
opportunity
of
angrily
order
my
father
out
of
the
house
,
in
his
presence
,
and
my
father
have
never
see
her
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
of
her
have
say
,
"
Matthew
will
come
and
see
me
at
last
when
I
be
lay
dead
upon
that
table
;
"

I
ask
Herbert
whether
his
father
be
so
inveterate
against
her
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
that
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
she
charge
him
,
in
the
presence
of
her
intend
husband
,
with
be
disappoint
in
the
hope
of
fawn
upon
her
for
his
own
advancement
,
and
,
if
he
be
to
go
to
her
now
,
it
would
look
true
---
even
to
him
---
and
even
to
her
.
<EOS>
to
return
to
the
man
and
make
an
end
of
him
.
<EOS>
the
marriage
day
be
fix
,
the
wedding
dress
be
buy
,
the
wedding
tour
be
plan
out
,
the
wedding
guest
be

<EOS>
the
day
come
,

not

<EOS>
He
write
her
a
letter

she
receive

I
strike
in
,

when
she
be

at
twenty
minute

nine

at

hour

minute

Herbert
,
nodding
,

at
which
she
afterwards
stop
all
the
clock

<EOS>
what
be
in
it
,
further
than
that
it
most
heartlessly
break
the
marriage
off
,
I
can
not
tell
you
,
because
I
do
not
know
.

when
she
recover
from
a
bad
illness
that
she
have
,
she
lay
the
whole
place
waste
,
as
you
have
see
it
,
and
she
have
never
since
look
upon
the
light
of
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
all
the
story
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
after
consider
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
I
know
of
it
;
and
indeed
I
only
know
so
much
,
through
piece
it
out
for
myself
;
for
my
father
always
avoid
it
,
and
,
even
when
Miss
Havisham
invite
me
to
go
there
,
tell
me
no
more
of
it
than
it
be
absolutely
requisite
<EOS>
I
should
understand
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
forget
one
thing
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
suppose
that
the
man
to
whom
she
give
her
misplaced
confidence
,
act
throughout
in
concert
with
her
half
-
brother
;
that
it
be
a
conspiracy
between
them
;
and
that
they
share
the
profit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
he
do
not
marry
her
and
get
all
the
property
,
"
say
I.
  
"
<EOS>
He
may
have
be
marry
already
,
and
her
cruel
mortification
may
have
be
a
part
of
her
half
-
brother
's
scheme
,
"
say
Herbert
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
mind
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
become
of
the
two
man
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
after
again
consider
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
fall
into
deep
shame
and
degradation
---
if
there
can
be
deep
---
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
they
alive
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
just
now
,
that
Estella
be
not
relate
to
Miss
Havisham
,
but
adopt
.
<EOS>
when
adopt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Herbert
shrug
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
there
have
always
be
an
Estella
,
since
I
have
hear
of
a
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
Handel
,
"
say
he
,
finally
throw
off
the
story
as
it
be
,
"
there
be
a
perfectly
open
understanding
between
us
.
<EOS>
all
that
I
know
about
Miss
Havisham
,
you
know
.

<EOS>

and
all
that
I
know
,
"
I
retort
,
"
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fully
believe
it
.
<EOS>
so
there
can
be
no
competition
or
perplexity
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
condition
on
which
you
hold
your
advancement
in
life
---
namely
,
that
you
be
not
to
inquire
or
discuss
<EOS>
to
whom
you
owe
it
---
you
may
be
very
sure
that
it
will
never
be
encroach
upon
,
or
even
approach
,
by
me
,
or
by
any
one
belong
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
truth
,
he
say
this
with
so
much
delicacy
,
that
I
feel
the
subject
do
with
,
even
though
I
should
be
under
his
father
's
roof
for
year
and
year
to
come
.
<EOS>
yet
he
say
it
with
so
much
meaning
,
too
,
that
I
feel
he
as
perfectly
understand
Miss
Havisham
to
be
my
benefactress
,
as
I
understand
the
fact
myself
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
not
occur
to
me
before
,
that
he
have
lead
up
to
the
theme
for
the
purpose
of
clear
it
out
of
our
way
;
but
we
be
so
much
the
light
and
easy
for
have
broach
it
,
that
I
now
perceive
this
to
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
We
be
very
gay
and
sociable
,
and
I
ask
him
,
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
what
he
be
?
<EOS>
He
reply
,
"
a
capitalist
---
an
Insurer
of
Ships
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
see
me
glance
about
the
room
in
search
of
some
token
of
shipping
,
or
capital
,
for
he
add
,
"
<EOS>
in
the
City
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
grand
idea
of
the
wealth
and
importance
of
Insurers
of
Ships
in
the
city
,
and
I
begin
to
think
with
awe
,
of
have
lay
a
young
Insurer
on
his
back
,
blacken
his
enterprising
eye
,
and
cut
his
responsible
head
open
.
<EOS>
but
,
again
,
there
come
upon
me
,
for
my
relief
<EOS>
that
odd
impression
that
Herbert
Pocket
would
never
be
very
successful
or
rich
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
rest
satisfied
with
merely
employ
my
capital
in
insuring
ship
.
<EOS>
I
shall
buy
up
some
good
Life
Assurance
share
,
and
cut
into
the
Direction
.
<EOS>
I
shall
also
do
a
little
in
the
mining
way
.
<EOS>
none
of
these
thing
will
interfere
with
my
charter
a
few
thousand
ton
on
my
own
account
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
trade
,
"
say
he
,
lean
back
in
his
chair
,
"
to
the
East
Indies
,
for
silk
,
shawl
,
spice
,
dye
,
drug
,
and
precious
wood
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
interesting
trade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
the
profit
be
large
?
"
say
I.
  
"
tremendous
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
I
waver
again
,
ana
begin
to
think
here
be
great
expectation
than
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
trade
,
also
,
"
say
he
,
put
his
thumb
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
"
to
the
West
Indies
,
for
sugar
,
tobacco
,
and
rum
.
<EOS>
also
to
Ceylon
,
specially
for
elephant
'
tusk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
want
a
good
many
ship
,
"
say
I.
  
"
a
perfect
fleet
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
Quite
overpower
by
the
magnificence
of
these
transaction
,
I
ask
him
where
the
ship
he
insure
mostly
trade
to
at
present
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
begin
insure
yet
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
look
about
me

<EOS>
somehow
,
that
pursuit
seem
more
in
keep
with
Barnard
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
I
say
(
in
a
tone
of
conviction
)
,
"
Ah
-
h
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
counting
-
house
,
and
look
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
a
counting
-
house
profitable
?
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
---
do
you
mean
to
the
young
fellow
who
be
in
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
n
-
no
:
not
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
this
with
the
air
of
one
carefully
reckon
up
and
strike
a
balance
.
"
<EOS>
not
directly
profitable
.
<EOS>
that
be
.
<EOS>
it
do
not
pay
me
anything
,
and
I
have
to
---
keep
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
certainly
have
not
a
profitable
appearance
,
and
I
shake
my
head
as
if
I
would
imply
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
lay
by
much
accumulative
capital
from
such
a
source
of
income
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
thing
be
,
"
say
Herbert
Pocket
,
"
that
you
look
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
that
be
\
 
<EOS>
the
grand
thing
.
<EOS>
You
be
in
a
counting
-
house
,
you
know
,
and
you
look
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
strike
me
as
a
singular
implication
that
you
could
not
be
out
of
a
counting
-
house
,
you
know
,
and
look
about
you
;
but
I
silently
defer
to
his
experience
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
the
time
come
,
"
say
Herbert
,
"
when
you
see
your
opening
.
<EOS>
and
you
go
in
,
and
you
swoop
upon
it
<EOS>
and
you
make
your
capital
,
<EOS>
and
then
there
you
be
!
<EOS>
when
you
have
once
make
your
capital
,
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
employ
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
like
his
way
of
conduct
that
encounter
in
the
garden
;
very
like
.
<EOS>
His
manner
of
bear
his
poverty
,
too
,
exactly
correspond
to
his
manner
of
bearing
that
defeat
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
he
take
all
blow
and
buffet
now
,
with
just
the
same
air
as
he
have
take
mine
then
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
he
have
nothing
around
him
but
<EOS>
the
simple
necessary
,
for
everything
that
I
remark
upon
turn
out
to
have
be
send
in
on
my
account
from
the
coffee
-
house
or
somewhere
else
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
have
already
make
his
fortune
in
his
own
mind
,
he
be
so
unassume
with
it
that
I
feel
quite
grateful
to
him
for
not
be
puff
up
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pleasant
addition
to
his
naturally
pleasant
way
,
and
we
get
on
famously
.
<EOS>
in
the
evening
we
go
out
for
a
walk
in
the
street
,
and
go
half
-
price
to
the
Theatre
;
and
next
day
we
go
to
church
at
Westminster
Abbey
,
and
in
the
afternoon
we
walk
in
the
Parks
;
and
I
wonder
who
shod
all
the
horse
there
,
and
wish
Joe
do
.
  
<EOS>
on
a
moderate
computation
,
it
be
many
month
,
that
Sunday
,
since
I
have
leave
Joe
and
Biddy
.
<EOS>
the
space
interpose
between
myself
and
them
,
partook
of
that
expansion
,
and
our
marsh
be
any
distance
off
.
<EOS>
that
I
could
have
be
at
our
old
church
in
my
old
church
-
go
clothe
,
on
the
very
last
Sunday
that
ever
be
,
seem
a
combination
of
impossibility
,
geographical
and
social
,
solar
and
lunar
.
<EOS>
yet
in
the
London
street
,
so
crowded
with
people
and
so
brilliantly
light
in
the
dusk
of
evening
,
there
be
depress
hint
of
reproach
for
that
I
have
put
the
poor
old
kitchen
at
home
so
far
away
;
and
in
the
dead
of
night
,
the
footstep
of
some
incapable
impostor
of
a
porter
mooning
about
Barnard
's
Inn
,
under
pretence
of
watch
it
,
fall
hollow
on
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Monday
morning
at
a
quarter
before
nine
,
Herbert
go
to
the
counting
-
house
to
report
himself
---
to
look
about
him
,
too
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
---
<EOS>
and
I
bear
him
company
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
come
away
in
an
hour
or
two
to
attend
me
to
Hammersmith
,
and
I
be
to
wait
about
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
that
the
egg
from
which
young
insurer
be
hatch
,
be
incubate
in
dust
and
heat
,
like
the
egg
of
ostrich
,
judge
from
the
place
to
which
those
incipient
giant
repair
on
a
Monday
morning
.
<EOS>
nor
do
the
counting
-
house
where
Herbert
assist
,
show
in
my
eye
as
at
all
a
good
observatory
;
be
a
back
second
floor
up
a
yard
,
of
a
grimy
presence
in
all
particular
,
and
with
a
look
into
another
back
second
floor
,
rather
than
a
look
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
wait
about
until
it
be
noon
,
and
I
go
upon
'
Change
,
and
I
see
fluey
man
sit
there
under
the
bill
about
shipping
,
whom
I
take
to
be
great
merchant
,
though
I
could
not
understand
why
they
should
all
be
out
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
when
Herbert
come
,
we
go
and
have
lunch
at
a
celebrated
house
which
I
then
quite
venerate
,
but
now
believe
to
have
be
the
most
abject
superstition
in
Europe
,
and
where
I
could
not
help
notice
,
even
then
,
that
there
be
much
more
gravy
on
the
tablecloth
and
knife
and
waiter
'
clothe
,
than
in
the
steak
.
<EOS>
this
collation
dispose
of
at
a
moderate
price
(
consider
the
grease
:
which
be
not
charge
for
)
,
we
go
back
to
Barnard
's
Inn
and
get
my
little
portmanteau
,
and
then
take
coach
for
Hammersmith
.
<EOS>
We
arrive
there
at
two
or
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
have
very
little
way
to
walk
to
Mr
Pocket
's
house
.
<EOS>
lift
the
latch
of
a
gate
,
we
pass
direct
into
a
little
garden
overlook
the
river
,
where
Mr
Pocket
's
child
be
play
about
.
<EOS>
and
unless
I
deceive
myself
on
a
point
where
my
interest
or
prepossession
be
certainly
not
concerned
,
I
see
that
Mr
and
Mrs
Pocket
's
child
be
not
grow
up
or
be
bring
up
,
but
be
tumble
up
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pocket
be
sit
on
a
garden
chair
under
a
tree
,
read
,
with
her
leg
upon
another
garden
chair
;
and
Mrs
Pocket
's
two
nursemaid
be
look
about
them
while
the
child
play
.
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
"
say
Herbert
,
"
this
be
young
Mr
Pip
.
"
<EOS>
upon
which
Mrs
Pocket
receive
me
with
an
appearance
of
amiable
dignity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
Alick
and
Miss
Jane
,
"
cry
one
of
the
nurse
to
two
of
the
child
"
if
you
go
a
bouncing
up
against
them
<EOS>
bush
<EOS>
you
will
fall
over
into
the
river
and
be
drownde
,
and
what
will
your
pa
say
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
this
nurse
pick
up
Mrs
Pocket
's
handkerchief
,
and
say
,
"
if
that
do
not
make
six
time
you
have
drop
it
,
Mum
!
"
<EOS>
upon
which
Mrs
Pocket
laugh
and
say
,
"
thank
you
,
Flopson
,
"
and
settle
herself
in
one
chair
only
,
resume
her
book
.
<EOS>
Her
countenance
immediately
assume
a
knitted
and
intent
expression
as
if
she
have
be
read
for
a
week
,
but
before
she
could
have
read
half
a
dozen
line
,
she
fix
her
eye
upon
me
,
and
say
,
"
I
hope
your
mamma
be
quite
well
?
"
<EOS>
this
unexpected
inquiry
put
me
into
such
a
difficulty
that
I
begin
say
in
the
absurdest
way
that
if
there
have
be
any
such
person
I
have
no
doubt
she
would
have
be
quite
well
and
would
have
be
very
much
oblige
and
would
have
send
her
compliment
,
when
the
nurse
come
to
my
rescue
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
she
cry
,
pick
up
the
pocket
handkerchief
,
"
if
that
do
not
make
seven
time
!
<EOS>
what
are
you
a
doing
of
this
afternoon
,
Mum
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Pocket
receive
her
property
,
at
first
with
a
look
of
unutterable
surprise
as
if
she
have
never
see
it
before
,
and
then
with
a
laugh
of
recognition
,
and
say
,
"
thank
you
,
Flopson
,
"
and
forget
me
,
and
go
on
read
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
,
now
I
have
leisure
to
count
them
,
that
there
be
no
few
than
six
little
pocket
present
,
in
various
stage
of
tumble
up
.
<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
arrive
at
the
total
when
a
seventh
be
hear
,
as
in
the
region
of
air
,
wail
dolefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
not
Baby
!
"
say
Flopson
,
appear
to
think
it
most
surprising
.
<EOS>
"
make
haste
up
,
miller
.
"
  
miller
,
who
be
the
other
nurse
,
retire
into
the
house
,
and
by
degree
the
child
's
wailing
be
hush
and
stop
,
as
if
it
be
a
young
ventriloquist
with
something
in
its
mouth
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pocket
read
all
the
time
,
and
I
be
curious
to
know
what
the
book
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
wait
,
I
suppose
,
for
Mr
Pocket
to
come
out
to
us
;
at
any
rate
we
wait
there
,
and
so
I
have
an
opportunity
of
observe
the
remarkable
family
phenomenon
that
whenever
any
of
the
child
stray
near
Mrs
Pocket
in
their
play
,
they
always
trip
themselves
up
and
tumble
over
her
---
always
very
much
to
her
momentary
astonishment
,
and
their
own
more
enduring
lamentation
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
a
loss
to
account
for
this
surprising
circumstance
,
and
could
not
help
give
my
mind
to
speculation
about
it
,
until
by
-
and
-
by
miller
come
down
with
the
baby
,
which
baby
be
hand
to
Flopson
,
which
Flopson
be
hand
it
to
Mrs
Pocket
,
when
she
too
go
fairly
head
foremost
over
Mrs
Pocket
,
baby
and
all
,
and
be
catch
by
Herbert
and
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
gracious
me
,
Flopson
!
"
say
Mrs
Pocket
,
look
off
her
book
for
a
moment
,
"
everybody
be
tumble
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
gracious
you
,
indeed
,
Mum
!
"
return
Flopson
,
very
red
in
the
face
;
"
what
have
you
get
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
get
here
,
Flopson
?
"
ask
Mrs
Pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
if
it
be
not
your
footstool
!
"
cry
Flopson
.
"
<EOS>
and
if
you
keep
it
under
your
skirt
like
that
,
who
be
to
help
tumble
?
<EOS>
here
!
<EOS>
take
the
baby
,
Mum
,
and
give
me
your
book
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pocket
act
on
the
advice
,
and
inexpertly
dance
the
infant
a
little
in
her
lap
,
while
the
other
child
play
about
it
.
<EOS>
this
have
last
but
<EOS>
a
very
short
time
,
when
Mrs
Pocket
issue
summary
order
that
they
be
all
to
be
take
into
the
house
for
a
nap
.
<EOS>
thus
I
make
the
second
discovery
on
that
first
occasion
,
that
the
nurture
of
the
little
Pockets
consist
of
alternately
tumble
up
and
lie
down
.
  
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
when
Flopson
and
Millers
have
get
the
child
into
the
house
,
like
a
little
flock
of
sheep
,
and
Mr
Pocket
come
out
of
it
to
make
my
acquaintance
,
I
be
not
much
surprised
to
find
that
Mr
Pocket
be
a
gentleman
with
a
rather
perplex
expression
of
face
,
and
with
his
very
grey
hair
disorder
on
his
head
,
as
if
he
do
not
quite
see
his
way
to
put
anything
straight
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
23
 
MR
POCKET
say
he
be
glad
to
see
me
,
and
he
hope
I
be
not
sorry
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
,
I
really
be
not
,
"
he
add
,
with
his
son
's
smile
,
"
an
alarming
personage
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
-
looking
man
,
in
spite
of
his
perplexity
and
his
very
grey
hair
,
and
his
manner
seem
quite
natural
.
<EOS>
I
use
the
word
natural
,
in
the
sense
of
its
be
unaffected
;
there
be
something
comic
in
his
distraught
way
,
as
though
it
would
have
be
downright
ludicrous
but
for
his
own
perception
that
it
be
very
near
be
so
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
talk
with
me
a
little
,
he
say
to
Mrs
Pocket
,
with
a
rather
anxious
contraction
of
his
eyebrow
,
which
be
black
and
handsome
,
"
Belinda
,
I
hope
you
have
welcome
Mr
Pip
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
look
up
from
her
book
,
and
say
,
"
yes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
smile
upon
me
in
an
absent
state
of
mind
,
and
ask
me
if
I
like
the
taste
of
orange
-
flower
water
?
<EOS>
as
the
question
have
no
bearing
,
near
or
remote
,
on
any
foregone
or
subsequent
transaction
,
I
consider
it
to
have
be
throw
out
,
like
her
previous
approach
,
in
general
conversational
condescension
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
out
within
a
few
hour
,
and
may
mention
at
once
,
that
Mrs
Pocket
be
the
only
daughter
of
a
certain
quite
accidental
deceased
Knight
,
who
have
invent
for
himself
a
conviction
that
his
deceased
father
would
have
be
make
a
Baronet
but
for
somebody
's
determined
opposition
arise
out
of
entirely
personal
motive
<EOS>
---
I
forget
whose
,
if
I
ever
know
---
the
Sovereign
's
,
the
Prime
Minister
's
,
the
Lord
Chancellor
's
,
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
's
,
<EOS>
anybody
's
---
and
have
tack
himself
on
to
the
noble
of
the
earth
in
right
of
this
quite
supposititious
fact
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
have
be
knight
himself
for
storm
the
English
grammar
at
the
point
of
the
pen
,
in
a
desperate
address
engross
on
vellum
,
on
the
occasion
of
the
laying
of
the
first
stone
of
some
building
or
other
,
and
for
hand
some
Royal
personage
either
the
trowel
or
the
mortar
.
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
he
have
direct
Mrs
Pocket
to
be
bring
up
from
her
cradle
as
one
who
in
the
nature
of
thing
must
marry
a
title
,
and
who
be
to
be
guard
from
the
acquisition
of
plebeian
domestic
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
so
successful
a
watch
and
ward
have
be
establish
over
the
young
lady
by
this
judicious
parent
,
that
she
have
grow
up
highly
ornamental
,
but
perfectly
helpless
and
useless
.
<EOS>
with
her
character
thus
happily
form
,
in
the
first
bloom
of
her
youth
she
have
encounter
Mr
Pocket
:
who
be
also
in
the
first
bloom
of
youth
,
and
not
quite
decide
whether
to
mount
to
the
Woolsack
,
or
to
roof
himself
in
with
a
mitre
.
<EOS>
as
his
do
the
one
or
the
other
be
a
mere
question
of
time
,
he
and
Mrs
Pocket
have
take
Time
by
the
forelock
(
when
,
to
judge
from
its
length
,
it
would
seem
to
have
want
cutting
)
,
and
have
marry
without
the
knowledge
of
the
judicious
parent
.
<EOS>
the
judicious
parent
,
have
nothing
to
bestow
or
withhold
but
his
blessing
,
have
handsomely
settle
that
dower
upon
them
after
a
short
struggle
,
and
have
inform
Mr
pocket
that
his
wife
be
"
a
treasure
for
a
Prince
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pocket
have
invest
the
Prince
's
treasure
in
the
way
of
the
world
ever
since
,
and
it
be
suppose
to
have
bring
him
in
but
indifferent
interest
.
<EOS>
still
,
Mrs
Pocket
be
in
general
the
object
of
a
queer
sort
of
respectful
pity
,
because
she
have
not
marry
a
title
;
while
Mr
Pocket
be
the
object
of
a
queer
sort
of
forgiving
reproach
,
because
he
have
never
get
one
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Pocket
take
me
into
the
house
and
show
me
my
room
:
which
be
a
pleasant
one
,
and
so
furnished
as
that
I
could
use
it
with
comfort
for
my
own
private
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
then
knock
at
the
door
of
two
other
similar
room
,
and
introduce
me
to
their
occupant
,
by
name
Drummle
and
Startop
.
<EOS>
Drummle
,
an
old
-
looking
young
man
of
a
heavy
order
of
architecture
,
be
whistle
.
<EOS>
Startop
,
young
in
year
and
appearance
,
be
read
and
hold
his
head
,
as
if
he
think
himself
in
danger
of
explode
it
with
too
strong
a
charge
of
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
both
Mr
and
Mrs
Pocket
have
such
a
noticeable
air
of
be
in
somebody
else
's
hand
,
that
I
wonder
who
really
be
in
possession
of
the
house
and
let
them
live
there
,
until
I
find
this
unknown
power
to
be
the
servant
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
smooth
way
of
go
on
,
perhaps
,
in
respect
of
save
trouble
;
but
it
have
the
appearance
of
be
expensive
,
for
the
servant
feel
it
<EOS>
a
duty
they
owe
to
themselves
to
be
nice
in
their
eating
and
drink
,
and
to
keep
a
deal
of
company
down
stair
.
<EOS>
They
allow
a
very
liberal
table
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Pocket
yet
it
always
appear
to
me
that
by
far
the
good
part
of
the
house
to
have
board
in
,
would
have
be
the
kitchen
---
always
suppose
the
boarder
capable
of
self
-
defence
,
for
,
before
I
have
be
there
a
week
,
a
neighbouring
lady
with
whom
the
family
be
personally
unacquainted
,
write
in
to
say
that
she
have
see
miller
slap
the
baby
.
<EOS>
this
greatly
distress
Mrs
Pocket
,
who
burst
into
tear
on
receive
the
note
,
and
say
that
it
be
an
extraordinary
thing
that
the
neighbour
could
not
mind
their
own
business
.
  
<EOS>
by
degree
I
learn
,
and
chiefly
from
Herbert
,
that
Mr
Pocket
have
be
educate
at
Harrow
and
at
Cambridge
,
where
he
have
distinguish
himself
;
but
that
when
he
have
have
the
happiness
of
marry
Mrs
Pocket
very
early
in
life
,
he
have
impair
his
prospect
and
take
up
the
calling
of
a
Grinder
.
<EOS>
after
grind
a
number
of
dull
blade
---
of
whom
it
be
remarkable
that
their
father
,
when
influential
,
be
always
go
to
help
him
to
preferment
,
but
always
forget
to
do
it
when
the
blade
have
leave
the
Grindstone
---
he
have
weary
of
that
poor
work
and
have
come
to
London
.
<EOS>
here
,
after
gradually
fail
in
loftier
hope
,
he
have
"
read
"
with
diver
who
have
lack
opportunity
or
neglect
them
,
and
have
refurbish
diver
other
for
special
occasion
,
and
have
turn
his
acquirement
to
the
account
of
literary
compilation
and
correction
,
and
on
such
mean
,
add
to
some
very
moderate
private
resource
,
still
maintain
the
house
I
see
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Pocket
have
a
toady
neighbour
;
a
widow
lady
of
that
highly
sympathetic
nature
that
she
agree
with
everybody
,
bless
everybody
,
and
shed
smile
and
tear
on
everybody
,
accord
to
circumstance
.
<EOS>
this
lady
's
name
be
Mrs
Coiler
,
and
I
have
the
honour
of
take
her
down
to
dinner
on
the
day
of
my
installation
.
<EOS>
She
give
me
to
understand
on
the
stair
,
that
it
be
a
blow
to
dear
Mrs
Pocket
that
dear
Mr
Pocket
should
be
under
the
necessity
of
receive
gentleman
to
read
with
him
.
<EOS>
that
do
not
extend
to
me
,
she
tell
me
in
a
gush
of
love
and
confidence
(
at
that
time
,
I
have
know
her
something
less
than
five
minute
)
;
if
they
be
all
like
Me
,
it
would
be
quite
another
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
dear
Mrs
Pocket
,
"
say
Mrs
Coiler
,
"
after
her
early
disappointment
(
not
that
dear
Mr
Pocket
be
to
blame
in
that
)
,
require
so
much
luxury
and
elegance
---
"
  
"
yes
,
madam
,
"
I
say
,
to
stop
her
,
for
I
be
afraid
she
be
go
to
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
she
be
of
so
aristocratic
a
disposition
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
madam
,
<EOS>
"
I
say
again
,
with
the
same
object
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
that
it
be
hard
,
"
say
Mrs
Coiler
,
"
to
have
dear
Mr
Pocket
's
time
and
attention
divert
from
dear
Mrs
Pocket
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
think
that
it
may
be
hard
if
the
butcher
's
time
and
attention
be
divert
from
dear
Mrs
Pocket
;
but
I
say
nothing
,
and
indeed
have
enough
to
do
in
keep
a
bashful
watch
upon
my
company
-
manner
.
  
<EOS>
It
come
to
my
knowledge
,
through
what
pass
between
Mrs
Pocket
and
Drummle
while
I
be
attentive
to
my
knife
and
fork
,
spoon
,
glass
,
and
other
instrument
of
self
-
destruction
,
that
Drummle
,
whose
christian
name
be
Bentley
,
be
actually
the
next
heir
but
one
to
a
baronetcy
.
<EOS>
It
further
appear
that
the
book
I
have
see
Mrs
Pocket
reading
in
the
garden
,
be
all
about
title
,
and
that
she
know
the
exact
date
at
which
her
grandpapa
would
have
come
into
the
book
,
if
he
ever
have
come
at
all
.
<EOS>
Drummle
do
not
say
much
,
but
in
his
limited
way
(
he
strike
me
as
a
sulky
kind
of
fellow
)
<EOS>
he
speak
as
one
of
the
elect
,
and
recognize
Mrs
Pocket
as
a
woman
and
a
sister
.
<EOS>
no
one
but
themselves
and
Mrs
Coiler
<EOS>
the
toady
neighbour
show
any
interest
in
this
part
of
the
conversation
,
and
it
appear
to
me
that
it
be
painful
to
Herbert
;
but
it
promise
to
last
a
long
time
,
when
the
page
come
in
with
the
announcement
of
a
domestic
affliction
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
in
effect
,
that
the
cook
have
mislay
the
beef
.
<EOS>
to
my
unutterable
amazement
,
I
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
see
Mr
Pocket
relieve
his
mind
by
go
through
a
performance
that
strike
me
as
very
extraordinary
,
but
which
make
no
impression
on
anybody
else
,
and
with
which
I
soon
become
as
familiar
as
the
rest
.
<EOS>
He
lay
down
the
carving
-
knife
and
fork
---
be
engage
in
carving
,
at
the
moment
---
put
his
two
hand
into
his
disturbed
hair
,
and
appear
to
make
an
extraordinary
effort
to
lift
himself
up
by
it
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
this
,
and
have
not
lift
himself
up
at
all
,
he
quietly
go
on
with
what
he
be
about
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Coiler
then
change
the
subject
,
and
begin
to
flatter
me
.
<EOS>
I
like
it
for
a
few
moment
,
but
she
flatter
me
so
very
grossly
that
the
pleasure
be
soon
over
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
serpentine
way
of
come
close
at
me
when
she
pretend
to
be
vitally
interested
in
the
friend
and
locality
I
have
leave
,
which
be
altogether
snaky
and
fork
-
tongue
;
and
when
she
make
an
occasional
bounce
upon
Startop
(
who
say
very
little
to
her
)
,
or
upon
Drummle
(
who
say
less
)
,
I
rather
envy
them
for
be
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
the
child
be
introduce
,
and
Mrs
Coiler
make
admire
comment
on
their
eye
,
nose
,
and
leg
---
a
sagacious
way
of
improve
their
mind
.
<EOS>
there
be
four
little
girl
,
and
two
little
boy
,
besides
the
baby
who
may
have
be
either
,
and
the
baby
's
next
successor
who
be
as
yet
neither
.
<EOS>
They
be
bring
in
by
Flopson
and
Millers
,
much
as
though
those
two
non
-
commission
officer
have
be
recruit
somewhere
for
child
and
have
enlist
these
:
while
Mrs
Pocket
look
at
the
young
Nobles
that
ought
to
have
be
,
as
if
she
rather
think
she
have
have
the
pleasure
of
inspect
them
before
,
but
do
not
quite
know
what
to
make
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
!
<EOS>
give
me
your
fork
,
Mum
,
and
take
the
baby
,
"
say
Flopson
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
take
it
that
way
,
or
you
will
get
its
head
under
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
thus
advise
,
Mrs
Pocket
take
it
the
other
way
,
and
get
its
head
upon
the
table
;
which
be
announce
to
all
present
by
a
prodigious
concussion
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
give
it
me
back
,
Mum
,
"
say
Flopson
;
"
and
Miss
Jane
,
come
and
dance
to
baby
,
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
little
girl
,
a
mere
mite
who
seem
to
have
prematurely
take
upon
herself
some
charge
of
the
other
,
step
out
of
her
place
by
me
,
and
dance
to
and
from
the
baby
until
it
leave
off
cry
,
and
laugh
.
<EOS>
then
,
all
the
child
laugh
,
and
Mr
Pocket
(
who
in
the
meantime
have
twice
endeavour
to
lift
himself
up
by
the
hair
)
laugh
,
and
we
all
laugh
and
be
glad
.
  
<EOS>
Flopson
,
by
dint
of
double
the
baby
at
the
joint
like
a
dutch
doll
,
then
get
it
safely
into
Mrs
Pocket
's
lap
,
and
give
it
the
nutcracker
to
play
with
:
at
the
same
time
recommend
Mrs
Pocket
to
take
notice
that
the
handle
of
that
instrument
be
not
likely
to
agree
with
its
eye
,
and
sharply
charge
Miss
Jane
to
look
after
the
same
.
<EOS>
then
,
the
two
nurse
leave
the
room
,
and
have
a
lively
scuffle
on
the
staircase
with
a
dissipate
page
who
have
wait
at
dinner
,
and
who
have
clearly
lose
half
his
button
at
the
gaming
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
make
very
uneasy
in
my
mind
by
Mrs
Pocket
's
fall
into
a
discussion
with
Drummle
respect
two
baronetcy
,
while
she
eat
a
sliced
orange
steep
in
sugar
and
wine
,
and
forget
all
about
the
baby
on
her
lap
:
who
do
most
appalling
thing
with
the
nutcracker
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
little
Jane
perceive
its
young
brain
to
be
imperille
,
softly
leave
her
place
,
and
with
many
small
artifice
coax
the
dangerous
weapon
away
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pocket
finish
her
orange
at
about
the
same
time
,
and
not
approve
of
this
,
say
to
Jane
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
naughty
child
,
how
dare
you
?
<EOS>
go
and
sit
down
this
instant
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
mamma
dear
,
"
lisp
the
little
girl
,
"
baby
ood

put
hith
eyeth
out

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
tell
me
so
?
"
retort
Mrs
Pocket
.
<EOS>
"
go
and
sit
down
in
your
chair
this
moment
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pocket
's
dignity
be
so
crush
,
that
I
feel
quite
abash
:
as
if
I
myself
have
do
something
to
rouse
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Belinda
,
"
remonstrate
Mr
Pocket
,
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
"
how
can
you
be
so
unreasonable
?
<EOS>
Jane
only
interfere
for
the
protection
of
baby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
allow
anybody
to
interfere
,
"
say
Mrs
Pocket
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
surprised
,
Matthew
,
that
you
should
expose
me
to
the
affront
of
interference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
God
!
"
cry
Mr
Pocket
,
in
an
outbreak
of
desolate
desperation
.
"
<EOS>
be
infant
to
be
nutcrackere
into
their
tomb
,
and
be
nobody
to
save
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
interfere
with
by
Jane
,
"
say
Mrs
Pocket
,
with
a
majestic
glance
at
that
innocent
little
offender
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
hope
I
know
my
poor
grandpapa
's
position
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Pocket
get
his
hand
in
his
hair
again
,
and
this
time
really
do
lift
himself
some
inch
out
of
his
chair
.
<EOS>
"
hear
this
!
"
<EOS>
he
helplessly
exclaim
to
the
element
.
<EOS>
"
baby
be
to
be
nutcrackere
dead
,
for
people
's
poor
grandpapa
's
position
!
"
then
he
let
himself
down
again
,
and
become
silent
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
look
awkwardly
at
the
table
-
cloth
while
this
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
a
pause
succeed
,
during
which
the
honest
and
irrepressible
baby
make
a
series
of
leap
and
crow
at
little
Jane
,
who
appear
to
me
to
be
the
only
member
of
the
family
(
irrespective
of
servant
)
with
whom
it
have
any
decide
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Drummle
,
"
say
Mrs
Pocket
,
"
will
you
ring
for
Flopson
?
<EOS>
Jane
,
you
undutiful
little
thing
,
go
and
lie
down
.
<EOS>
now
,
baby
darling
,
come
with
ma
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
baby
be
the
soul
of
honour
,
and
protest
with
all
its
might
.
<EOS>
It
double
itself
up
the
wrong
way
over
Mrs
Pocket
's
arm
,
exhibit
a
pair
of
knit
shoe
and
dimple
ankle
to
the
company
in
lieu
of
its
soft
face
,
and
be
carry
out
in
the
high
state
of
mutiny
.
<EOS>
and
it
gain
its
point
after
all
,
for
I
see
it
through
the
window
within
a
few
minute
,
be
nurse
by
little
Jane
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
that
the
other
five
child
be
leave
behind
at
the
dinner
-
table
,
through
Flopson
's
have
some
private
engagement
,
and
their
not
be
anybody
else
's
business
.
<EOS>
I
thus
become
aware
of
the
mutual
relation
between
them
and
Mr
Pocket
,
which
be
exemplify
in
the
follow
manner
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pocket
,
with
the
normal
perplexity
of
his
face
heighten
and
his
hair
rumple
,
look
at
them
for
some
minute
,
as
if
he
could
not
make
out
how
they
come
to
be
board
and
lodge
in
that
establishment
,
and
why
they
have
not
be
billet
by
Nature
on
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
then
,
in
a
distant
,
missionary
way
he
ask
them
certain
question
---
<EOS>
as
why
little
Joe
have
that
hole
in
his
frill
:
who
say
,
Pa
,
Flopson
be
go
to
mend
it
when
she
have
time
---
and
how
little
Fanny
come
by
that
whitlow
:
<EOS>
who
say
,
Pa
,
Millers
be
go
to
poultice
it
when
she
do
not
forget
.
<EOS>
then
,
he
melt
into
parental
tenderness
,
and
give
them
a
shilling
apiece
and
tell
them
to
go
and
play
;
and
then
as
they
go
out
,
with
one
very
strong
effort
to
lift
himself
up
by
the
hair
he
dismiss
the
hopeless
subject
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
there
be
row
on
the
river
.
<EOS>
as
Drummle
and
Startop
have
each
a
boat
,
I
resolve
to
set
up
mine
,
and
to
cut
them
both
out
.
<EOS>
I
be
pretty
good
at
most
exercise
in
which
country
-
boy
be
adept
,
but
,
as
I
be
conscious
of
want
elegance
of
style
for
the
Thames
---
not
to
say
for
other
water
---
I
at
once
engage
to
place
myself
under
the
tuition
of
the
winner
of
a
prize
-
wherry
who
ply
at
our
stair
,
and
to
whom
I
be
introduce
by
my
new
ally
.
<EOS>
this
practical
authority
confuse
me
very
much
,
by
say
I
have
the
arm
of
a
blacksmith
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
know
how
nearly
the
compliment
lose
him
his
pupil
,
I
doubt
if
he
would
have
pay
it
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
supper
-
tray
after
we
get
home
at
night
,
and
I
think
we
should
all
have
enjoy
ourselves
,
but
for
a
rather
disagreeable
domestic
occurrence
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pocket
be
in
good
spirit
,
when
a
housemaid
come
in
,
and
say
,
"
if
you
please
,
sir
,
I
should
wish
to
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
speak
to
your
master
?
"
say
Mrs
Pocket
,
whose
dignity
be
refuse
again
.
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
go
and
speak
to
Flopson
.
<EOS>
or
speak
to
me
---
at
some
other
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
beg
your
pardon
,
madam
,
"
return
the
housemaid
,
"
I
should
wish
to
speak
at
once
,
and
to
speak
to
master
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
Mr
Pocket
go
out
of
the
room
,
and
we
make
the
good
of
ourselves
until
he
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
pretty
thing
,
Belinda

"
say
Mr
Pocket
,
return
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
grief
and
despair
.
<EOS>
"
here

insensibly
drunk

floor

show
much
amiable

have

Mr

utter

"
<EOS>
besides

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
sofa
where
Mr
Pocket
stand
,
and
he
drop
upon
it
in
the
attitude
of
the
Dying
Gladiator
.
<EOS>
still
in
that
attitude
he
say
,
with
a
hollow
voice
,
"
good

when
I

it
advisable
to

Chapter
24
 
<EOS>
after
two
or
three
day
,
when
I
have
establish
myself
in
my
room
and
have
go
backwards
and
forwards
to
London
several
time
,
and
have
order
all
I
want
of
my
tradesman
,
Mr
Pocket
<EOS>
and
I
have
a
long
talk
together
.
<EOS>
He
know
more
of
my
intended
career
than
I
know
myself
,
for
he
refer
to
his
have
be
tell
by
Mr
Jaggers
that
I
be
not
design
for
any
profession
,
and
that
I
should
be
well
enough
educate
for
my
destiny
if
I
could
"
hold
my
own
"
with
the
average
of
young
man
in
prosperous
circumstance
.
<EOS>
I
acquiesce
,
of
course
,
know
nothing
to
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
He
advise
my
attend
certain
place
in
London
,
for
the
acquisition
of
such
mere
rudiment
as
I
want
,
and
my
invest
him
with
the
function
of
explainer
and
director
of
all
my
study
.
<EOS>
He
hope
that
with
intelligent
assistance
I
should
meet
with
little
to
discourage
me
,
and
should
soon
be
able
to
dispense
with
any
aid
but
his
.
<EOS>
through
his
way
of
say
this
,
and
much
more
to
similar
purpose
,
he
place
himself
on
confidential
term
with
me
in
an
admirable
manner
;
and
I
may
state
at
once
that
he
be
always
so
zealous
and
honourable
in
fulfil
his
compact
with
me
,
that
he
make
me
zealous
and
honourable
in
fulfil
mine
with
him
.
<EOS>
lf
he
have
show
indifference
as
a
master
,
I
have
no
doubt
I
should
have
return
the
compliment
as
a
pupil
;
he
give
me
no
such
excuse
,
and
each
of
us
do
the
other
justice
.
<EOS>
nor
,
do
I
ever
regard
him
as
have
anything
ludicrous
about
him
---
or
anything
<EOS>
but
what
be
serious
,
honest
,
and
good
---
in
his
tutor
communication
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
when
these
point
be
settle
,
and
so
far
carry
out
as
that
I
have
begin
to
work
in
earnest
,
it
occur
to
me
that
if
I
could
retain
my
bedroom
in
Barnard
's
Inn
,
my
life
would
be
agreeably
varied
,
while
my
manner
would
be
none
the
bad
for
Herbert
's
society
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pocket
do
not
object
to
this
arrangement
,
but
urge
that
before
any
step
could
possibly
be
take
in
it
,
it
must
be
submit
to
my
guardian
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
his
delicacy
arise
out
of
the
consideration
that
the
plan
would
save
Herbert
some
expense
,
so
I
go
off
to
Little
Britain
and
impart
my
wish
to
Mr
Jaggers
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
could
buy
the
furniture
now
hire
for
me
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
one
or
two
other
little

I
should
be
quite
at

there

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
go

say
Mr
Jaggers
,
with
a

laugh
.
<EOS>

I
tell
you

<EOS>
how

"
  
<EOS>
I

I

"

retort
Mr

his

on

his

on
the

behind
me

"
It

Mr

with
a

"
<EOS>

"
  
<EOS>
this
strongly
mark
way
of
do
business
make
a
strongly
mark
impression
on
me
,
and
that
not
of
an
agreeable
kind

<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
never
laugh
;
but
he
wear
great
bright
creaking
boot

and
,
in
poise
himself
on
these
boot

with
his
large

bend
down

await

creak

<EOS>
they
\
 
<EOS>
laugh
in

dry

suspicious

<EOS>
as
he
happen
to
go
out
now
,
and
as
Wemmick
be
brisk
and
talkative
,
I
say
to
Wemmick
that
I
hardly
know
what
to

of
Mr

<EOS>
"
tell

Wemmick

---

for
I
look

<EOS>
Wemmick
be
at

he

<EOS>

without

He

Wemmick

he
put
down

You

before
put
his

again

Wemmick
touch
the
large
of
his
mourning
ring
,
and
say
,

<EOS>
while
he
be
put
up
the

come
down
from

the
thought
cross
my

that
all
his
personal

derive
from

<EOS>
as
he
have
show
no
diffidence
on

I

They

curiosity

they

property

<EOS>
They
may
not

worth
much

,
after
all

they
be
property

portable

It
do
not

<EOS>
when
I
have
render
homage
to
this

he
go
on

in

friendly
manner

<EOS>
"

you

I
could
offer
you
a

I
should
consider
it
an
honour

<EOS>
I
have
not

to
show
you

I

<EOS>
I
reply
,
that
depend
on
the
original
wildness
of
the
beast
,
and
the
amount
of
taming

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
would
do
so

with
all
the
interest

curiosity
that
his
preparation
awaken

<EOS>
as
I

me
if
I
would

to
devote
five
minute
to

because
I

Mr

I
reply
in

affirmative

We

BENTLEY
DRUMMLE
,
who
be
so
sulky
a
fellow
that
he
even
take
up
a
book
<EOS>
as
if
its
writer
have
do
him
an
injury
,
do
not
take
up
an
acquaintance
in
a
more
agreeable
spirit
.
<EOS>
heavy
in
figure
,
movement
,
and
comprehension
---
in
the
sluggish
complexion
of
his
face
,
and
in
the
large
awkward
tongue
that
seem
to
loll
about
in
his
mouth
as
he
himself
loll
about
in
a
room
<EOS>
---
he
be
idle
,
proud
,
niggardly
,
reserve
,
and
suspicious
.
<EOS>
He
come
of
rich
people
down
in
Somersetshire
,
who
have
nurse
this
combination
of
quality
until
they
make
the
discovery
that
it
be
just
of
age
and
a
blockhead
.
<EOS>
thus
,
Bentley
Drummle
have
come
to
Mr
Pocket
when
he
be
a
head
tall
than
that
gentleman
,
and
half
a
dozen
head
thick
than
most
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
startop
have
be
spoil
by
a
weak
mother
and
keep
at
home
when
he
ought
to
have
be
at
school
,
but
he
be
devotedly
attach
to
her
,
and
admire
her
beyond
measure
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
woman

delicacy
of

be
---
"
as
you
may
see
,
though
you
never
see
her

"
say
Herbert
to
me
---
exactly
like
his
mother
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
natural
that
I
should
take
to
him
much
more
kindly
than
to
Drummle
,
and
that
,
even
in
the
early
evening
of
our
boating
,
he
and
I
should
pull
homeward
abreast
of
one
another
,
converse
from
boat
to
boat
,
while
Bentley
Drummle
come
up
in
our
wake
alone
,
under
the
overhang
bank
and
among
the
rush
.
<EOS>
He
would
always
creep
in
-
shore
like
some
uncomfortable
amphibious
creature
,
even
when
the
tide
would
have
send
him
fast
upon
his
way
;
and
I
always
think
of
him
as
come
after
us
in
the
dark
or
by
the
back
-
water
,
when
our
own
two
boat
be
break
the
sunset
or
the
moonlight
in
mid

stream
.
  
<EOS>
Herbert
be
my
intimate
companion
and
friend
.
<EOS>
I
present
him
with
a
half
-
share
in
my
boat
,
which
be
the
occasion
of
his
often
come
down
to
Hammersmith
;
and
my
possession
of
a
half
-
share
in
his
chamber
often
take
me
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
We
use
to
walk
between
the
two
place
at
all
hour
.
<EOS>
I
hive
an

it
be
not
so
pleasant
a

as
it
be
then
)
,
form
in
the
impressibility
of
untried
youth

I

Mr

<EOS>
She
be
a

---
an
indigestive
single
woman
,
who
call
her
rigidity
religion
,
and
her
liver
love
.
<EOS>
these
people
hate
me
with
the
hatred
of
cupidity
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
as
a
matter
of
course
,
they
fawn
upon
me
in
my
prosperity
with
the
base
meanness
.
<EOS>
towards
Mr
Pocket
,
as
a
grow

up
infant
with
no
notion
of
his

they
show
the
complacent
forbearance
I
have
hear
them
express
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pocket
they
hold
in
contempt
;
but
they
allow
the
poor
soul
to
have
be
heavily
disappoint
in
life
,
because
that
shed
a
feeble
reflected
light
upon
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
surrounding
among
which
I
settle
down
,
and
apply
myself
to
my
education
.
<EOS>
I
soon
contract
expensive
habit
,
and
begin
to
spend
an
amount
of
money
that
within
a
few
short
month
I
should
have
think
almost
fabulous
;
but
through
good
and
evil
I
stick
to
my
book
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
merit
in
this
,
than
my
have
sense
enough
to
feel
my
deficiency
.
<EOS>
between
Mr

and
Herbert
<EOS>
I
get
on
fast
;
and
,
with
one
or
the
other
always
at
my
elbow
to
give
me
the
start
I
want
,
and
clear
obstruction
out
of
my
road
<EOS>
,
I
must
have
be
as
great
a
dolt
as
Drummle
if
I
have
do
less
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
Mr
Wemmick
for
some
week
,
when
I
think
I
would
write
him
a
note
and
propose
to
go
home
with
him
on
a
certain
evening
.
<EOS>
He
reply
that
it
would
give
him
much
pleasure
,
and
that
he
would
expect
me
at
the
office
at
six
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Thither
I
go
,
and
there
I
find
him
,
put
the
key
of
his
safe
down
his
back
as
the
clock
strike
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
of
walk
down
to
Walworth
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
you
approve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
much
,
"
be
Wemmick
's
reply
,
"
for
I
have
have
my
leg
under
the
desk
all
day
,
and
shall
be
glad
to
stretch
them
.
<EOS>
now
I
will
tell
you
what
I
have
get
for
supper
,
Mr
Pip
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
a
stewed
steak---
which
be
of
home
preparation---
and
a
cold
roast
fowl
---
which
be
from
the
cook's
-
shop
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
tender
,
because
the
master
of
the
shop
be
a
Juryman
in
some
case
of
ours
the
other
day
,
and
we
let
him
down
easy
.
<EOS>
I
remind
him
of
it
when
I
buy
the
fowl
,
and
I
say
,
"
pick
us
out
a
good
one
,
old
Briton
,
because
if
we
have
choose
to
keep
you
in
the
box
another
day
or
two
,
we
could
easily
have
do
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
to
that
,
"
let
me
make
you
a
present
of
the
good
fowl
in
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
I
let
him
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
it
go
,
it
be
property
and
portable
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
object
to
an
aged
parent
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
really
think
he
be
still
speak
of
the
fowl
,
until
he
add
,
"
because
I
have
get
an
aged
parent
at
my
place
.
<EOS>
"
I
then
say
what
politeness
require
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
,
you
have
not
dine
with
Mr
Jaggers
yet
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
pursue
,
as
we
walk
along
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
tell
me
so
this
afternoon
when
he
hear
you
be
come
.
<EOS>
I
expect
you
will
have
an
invitation
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
ask
your
pal
,
too
.
<EOS>
three
of
'em
;
be
not
there
?
"
  
<EOS>

Drummle

yes

<EOS>
"
well
,
he

go
to
ask
the
whole
gang
;

I
hardly
feel
compliment
by
the
word

and
whatever
he
give
you
,
he
will
give
you
good
.
<EOS>
do
not
look
forward
to
variety
,
but
you
will
have
excellence

<EOS>
and
there
be
another
tum
thing
in
his
house
,
"
proceed
Wemmick
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
as
if
the
remark
follow
on
the
housekeeper
understand
;
"
he
never
let
a
door
or
window
be
fasten
at
night

<EOS>
"
  
"
be
he
never
rob
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
it
!
"
return
Wemmick
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
,
and
give
it
out
publicly
,
"
I
want
to
see
the
man
who
will
rob
 
<EOS>
\
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
<EOS>
,
I
have
hear
him
,
a
hundred
time
if
I
have
hear
him
once
,
say
to
regular
cracksman
in
our
front
office
,
"
You
know
where
I
live
;
now
,
no
bolt

ever
draw
there
;
why
do
not
you
do
a
stroke
of
business
with
me
?
<EOS>
come
;
can
not
I
tempt
you
?
"
<EOS>
not
a
man
of
them
,
sir
,
would
be
bold
enough
to
try
it
on
,
for
love
or
money

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
dread
him
so
much
?
"
say
I.
  
"
dread
him
,
"
say
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
they
dread
him
.
<EOS>
not
but
what
he
be
artful
,
even
in
his
defiance
of
them
.
<EOS>
no
silver
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Britannia
metal
,
every
spoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
they
would
not
have
much
,
"
I
observe
,
"
<EOS>
even
if
they
---
"
  
"
ah
!
<EOS>
but
 
\
<EOS>
he
\
 
<EOS>
would
have
much
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
cut
me
short
,
"
and
they
know
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
their
life
,
and
the
life
of
score
of
'em
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
all
he
could
get
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
impossible
to
say
what
he
could
not
get
,
if
he
give
his
mind
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
fall
into
meditation
on
my
guardian
's
greatness
,
when
Wemmick
remark
:
  
"
<EOS>
as
to
the
absence
of
plate
,
that
be
only
his
natural
depth
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
a
river
's
its
natural
depth
,
and
he
be
his
natural
depth
.
<EOS>
look
at
his
watch
-
chain
.
<EOS>
that
be
real
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
massive
,
"
say
I.
  
"
massive
?
"
<EOS>
repeat
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
and
his
watch
be
a
gold
repeater
,
and
worth
a
hundred
pound
if
it
be
worth
a
penny
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pip
,
there
be
about
seven
hundred
thief
in
this
town
who
know
all
about
that
watch
;
there
be
not
a
man
,
a
woman
,
or
a
child
,
among
them
,
who
would
not
identify
the
small
link
in
that
chain
,
and
drop
it
as
if
it
be
red
-
hot
,
if
inveigle
into
touch
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
first
with
such
discourse
,
and
afterwards
with
conversation
of
a
more
general
nature
,
do
Mr
Wemmick
and
I
<EOS>
beguile
the
time
and
the
road
,
until
he
give
me
to
understand
that
we
have
arrive
in
the
district
of
Walworth
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
to
be
a
collection
of
back
lane
,
ditch
,
and
little
garden
,
and
to
present
the
aspect
of
a
rather
dull
retirement
.
<EOS>
Wemmick
's
house
be
a
little
wooden
cottage
in
the
midst
of
plot
of
garden
,
and
the
top
of
it
be
cut
out
and
paint
like
a
battery
mount
with
gun
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
doing
,
"
say
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
look
pretty
;
do
not
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
highly
commend
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
the
small
house
I
ever
see
;
with
the
queer
gothic
window
(
by
far
the
great
part
of
them
sham
)
,
and
a
gothic
door
,
almost
too
small
to
get
in
at
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
real
flagstaff
,
you
see
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
and
on
Sundays
I
run
up
a
real
flag
.
<EOS>
then
look
here
.
<EOS>
after
I
have
cross
this
bridge
,
I
hoist
it
up
---
so
---
and
cut
off
the
communication
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bridge
be
a
plank
,
and
it
cross
a
chasm
about
four
foot
wide
and
two
deep
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
very
pleasant
to
see
the
pride
with
which
he
hoist
it
up
and
make
it
fast
;
smile
as
he
do
so
,
with
a
relish
and
not
merely
mechanically
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
nine
o'clock
every
night
,
Greenwich
time
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
the
gun
fire
.
<EOS>
there
he
be
,
you
see
!
<EOS>
and
when
you
hear
him
go
,
I
think
you
will
say
he
be
a
Stinger
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
piece
of
ordnance
refer
to
,
be
mount
in
a
separate
fortress
,
construct
of
lattice
-
work
.
<EOS>
It
be
protect
from
the
weather
by
an
ingenious
little
tarpaulin
contrivance
in
the
nature
of
an
umbrella
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
at
the
back
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
out
of
sight
,
so
as
not
to
impede
the
idea
of
fortification
<EOS>
---
for
it
be
a
principle
with
me
,
if
you
have
an
idea
,
carry
it
out
and
keep
it
up
---
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
that
be
your
opinion
---
"
  
I
say
,
decidedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
at
the
back
,
there
be
a
pig
,
and
there
be
fowl
and
rabbit
;
then
,
I
knock
together
my
own
little
frame
,
you
see
,
and
grow
cucumber
;
and
you
will
judge
at
supper
what
sort
of
a
salad
I
can
raise
.
<EOS>
so
,
sir
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
smile
again
,
but
seriously
too
,
as
he
shake
his
head
,
"
if
you
can
suppose
the
little
place
besiege
,
it
would
hold
out
a
devil
of
a
time
in
point
of
provision
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
,
he
conduct
me
to
a
bower
about
a
dozen
yard
off
,
but
which
be
approach
by
such
ingenious
twist
of
path
that
it
take
quite
a
long
time
to
get
at
;
and
in
this
retreat
our
glass
be
already
set
forth
.
<EOS>
Our
punch
be
cool
in
an
ornamental
lake
on
whose
margin
the
bower
be
raise
.
<EOS>
this
piece
of
water
(
with
an
island
in
the
middle
which
may
have
be
the
salad
for
supper
)
be
of
a
circular
form
,
and
he
have
construct
a
fountain
in
it
,
which
,
when
you
set
a
little
mill
go
and
take
a
cork
out
of
a
pipe
,
play
to
that
powerful
extent
that
it
make
the
back
of
your
hand
quite
wet

<EOS>
"
I
be
my
own
engineer

my
own
carpenter

Wemmick

in
acknowledge
my
compliment

well

It

"
  
<EOS>
I
express
the
readiness
I
feel
,
and
we
go
into
the
castle
.
<EOS>
there
,
we
find
,
sit
by
a
fire
,
a
very
old
man
in
a
flannel
coat

clean

cheerful

comfortable

well
care

intensely
deaf

"
well

Wemmick

shake

him
in

Mr

away
at

"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
fine
place
of
my
son
's
,
sir

"
cry
the
old
man
,
while
I
nod
as
hard
as
I
possibly
could
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
pretty
pleasure
-
ground
,
sir

this
spot

<EOS>
"
You
be
as
proud
of
it
as
Punch
;
be
not
you

"
say
Wemmick
,
contemplate
the
old
man
,
with
his
hard
face
really
soften
;

there
be

a
nod

if
you
be
not
tired

Mr

will
you

him
one
more

You
can

<EOS>
I
tip
him
several
more
,
and
he
be
in
great
spirit
.
<EOS>
We
leave
him
bestir
himself
to
feed
the
fowl
,
and
we
sit
down
to
our
punch
in
the
arbour
;
where
Wemmick
tell
he
as
he
smoke
a
pipe
that
it
have
take
him
a
good
many
year
to
bring
the
property
up

its

pitch

"
be

Mr

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
o
yes
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
I
have
get
hold
of
it
,
a
bit
at
a
time

a

"
never

<EOS>
"
never

<EOS>
never

<EOS>
never
hear
of
him

<EOS>
no

the
office
be
one
thing
,

private
life
be
another

<EOS>
when
I
go
into
the
office
,
I
leave
the
Castle
behind
me
,

when
I
come
into
the
Castle
,
I
leave
the
office
behind
me

<EOS>
if
it
be
not
in
any
way
disagreeable
to
you
,
you
will
oblige
me
by
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
it
professionally
speak
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
I
feel
my
good
faith
involve
in
the
observance
of
his
request
.
<EOS>
the
punch
be
very
nice
,
we
sit
there
drink
it
and
talk
,
until
it
be
almost
nine
o'clock
.
"
<EOS>
get
near
gun
-
fire
,
"
say
Wemmick
then
,
as
he
lay
down
his
pipe
;
"
it
be
the
Aged
's
treat
.
"
  
<EOS>
proceeding
into
the
Castle
again
,
we
find
the
aged
heating
the
poker
,
with
expectant
eye
,
as
a
preliminary
to
the
performance
of
this
great
nightly
ceremony
.
<EOS>
Wemmick
stand
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
,
until
the
moment
be
come
for
him
to
take
the
red
-
hot
poker
from
the
aged
,
and
repair
to
the
battery
.
<EOS>
He
take
it
,
and
go
out
,
and
presently
the
Stinger
go
off
with
a
Bang
that
shake
the
crazy
little
box
of
a
cottage
as
if
it
must
fall
to
piece
,
and
make
every
glass
and
teacup
in
it
ring
.
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
aged
---
who
I
believe
would
have
be
blow
out
of
his
arm
-
chair
but
for
hold
on
by
the
elbow
---
cry
out
exultingly
,
"
He
be
fire
!
<EOS>
I
heerd
him
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
nod
at
the
old
gentleman
until
it
be
no
figure
of
speech
to
declare
that
I
absolutely
could
not
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
interval
between
that
time
and
supper
,
Wemmick
devote
to
show
me
his
collection
of
curiosity
.
<EOS>
They
be
mostly
of
a
felonious
character
;
comprise
the
pen
with
which
a
celebrate
forgery
have
be
commit
,
a
distinguished
razor
or
two
,
some
lock
of
hair
,
and
several
manuscript
confession
write
under
condemnation
---
upon
which
Mr
Wemmick
set
particular
value
as
be
,
to
use
his
own
word
,
"
every
one
of
'em
Lies
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
these
be
agreeably
disperse
among
small
specimen
of
china
and
glass
various
neat
trifle
make
by
the
proprietor
of
the
museum
,
and
some
tobacco
-
stopper
carve
by
the
aged
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
display
in
that
chamber
of
the
Castle
into
which
I
have
be
first
induct
,
and
which
serve
,
not
only
as
the
general
sitting
-
room
but
as
the
kitchen
too
,
if
I
may
judge
from
a
saucepan
on
the
hob
,
and
a
brazen
bijou
over
the
fireplace
design
for
the
suspension
of
a
roast
-
jack
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
neat
little
girl
in
attendance
,
who
look
after
the
Aged
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
lay
the
supper
-
cloth
,
the
bridge
be
lower
to
give
her
mean
of
egress
,
and
she
withdraw
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
the
supper
be
excellent
;
and
though
the
Castle
be
rather
subject
to
dry
-
rot
insomuch
that
it
taste
like
a
bad
nut
,
and
though
the
pig
may
have
be
farther
off
,
I
be
heartily
pleased
with
my
whole
entertainment
.
<EOS>
nor
be
there
any
drawback
on
my
little
turret
bedroom
,
beyond
there
be
such
a
very
thin
ceiling
between
me
and
the
flagstaff
,
that
when
I
lie
down
on
my
back
in
bed
,
it
seem
as
if
I
have
to
balance
that
pole
on
my
forehead
all
night
.
  
<EOS>
Wemmick
be
up
early
in
the
morning
,
and
I
be
afraid
I
hear
him
clean
my
boot
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
he
fall
to
gardening
,
and
I
see
him
from
my
gothic
window
pretend
to
employ
the
aged
,
and
nodding
at
him
in
a
most
devoted
manner
.
<EOS>
Our
breakfast
be
as
good
as
the
supper
,
and
at
half
-
past
eight
precisely

Wemmick
get
dryer
and
harder
as
we
go
along
,
and
his
mouth
tighten
into
a
post
-
office
again
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
we
get
to
his
place
of
business
and
he
pull
out
his
key
from
his
coat
-
collar
,
he
look
as
unconscious
of
his
Walworth
property
as
if
the
Castle
and
the
drawbridge
and
the
arbour
and
the
lake
and
the
fountain
and
the
aged
,
have
all
be

it
fall
out
as
Wemmick
have
tell
me
it
would
,
that
I
have
an
early
opportunity
of
compare
my
guardian
's
establishment
with
that
of
his
cashier
and
clerk
.
<EOS>
My
guardian
be
in
his
room
,
wash
his
hand
with
his
scent
soap
,
when
I
go
into
the
office
from
Walworth
;
and
he
call
me
to
him
,
and
give
me
the
invitation
for
myself
and
friend
which
Wemmick
have
prepare
me
to
receive
.
"
<EOS>
no
ceremony
,
"
he
stipulate
,
"
and
no
dinner
dress
,
and
say
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
him
where
we
should
come
to
(
for
I
have
no
idea
where
he
live
)
,
and
I
believe
it
be
in
his
general
objection
to
make
anything
like
an
admission
,
that
he
reply
,
"
come
here
,
and
I
will
take
you
home
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
embrace
this
opportunity
of
remark
that
he
wash
his
client
off
,
as
if
he
be
a
surgeon
or
a
dentist
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
closet
in
his
room
,
fit
up
for
the
purpose
,
which
smell
of
the
scent
soap
like
a
perfumer
's
shop
.
<EOS>
It
have
an
unusually
large
jack
-
towel
on
a
roller
inside
the
door
,
and
he
would
wash
his
hand
,
and
wipe
them
and
dry
them
all
over
this
towel
,
whenever
he
come
in
from
a
police
-
court
or
dismiss
a
client
from
his
room
.
<EOS>
when
I
and
my
friend
repair
to
him
at
six
o'clock
next
day
,
he
seem
to
have
be
engage
on
a
case
of
a
dark
complexion
than
usual
,
for
,
we
find
him
with
his
head
butt
into
this
closet
,
not
only
wash
his
hand
,
but
lave
his
face
and
gargle
his
throat
.
<EOS>
and
even
when
he
have
do
all
that
,
and
have
go
all
round
the
jack
-
towel
,
he
take
out
his
penknife
and
scrape
the
case
out
of
his
nail
before
he
put
his
coat
on
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
people
slink
about
as
usual
when
we
pass
out
into
the
street
,
who
be
evidently
anxious
to
speak
with
him
;
but
there
be
something
so
conclusive
in
the
halo
of
scent
soap
which
encircle
his
presence
,
that
they
give
it
up
for
that
day
.
<EOS>
as
we
walk
along
westward
,
he
be
recognize
ever
and
again
by
some
face
in
the
crowd
of
the
street
,
and
whenever
that
happen
he
talk
louder
to
me
;
but
he
never
otherwise
recognize
anybody
,
or
take
notice
that
anybody
recognize
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
conduct
us
to
Gerrard
-
street
,
Soho
,
to
a
house
on
the
south
side
of
that
street
.
<EOS>
rather
a
stately
house
of
its
kind
,
but
dolefully
in
want
of
painting
,
and
with
dirty
window
.
<EOS>
He
take
out
his
key
and
open
the
door
,
and
we
all
go
into
a
stone
hall
,
bare
,
gloomy
,
and
little
used
.
<EOS>
so
,
up
a
dark
brown
staircase
into
a
series
of
three
dark
brown
room
on
the
first
floor
.
<EOS>
there
be
carve
garland
on
the
panel
wall
,
and
as
he
stand
among
them
give
us
welcome
,
I
know
what
kind
of
loop
I
think
they
look
like
.
  
<EOS>
dinner
be
lay
in
the
good
of
these
room
;
the
second
be
his
dressing
-
room
;
the
third
,
his
bedroom
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
that
he
hold
the
whole
house
,
but
rarely
use
more
of
it
than
we
see
.
<EOS>
the
table
be
comfortably
lay
---
<EOS>
no
silver
in
the
service
,
of
course
---
and
at
the
side
of
his
chair
be
a
capacious
dumb
-
waiter
,
with
a
variety
of
bottle
and
decanter
on
it
,
and
four
dish
of
fruit
for
dessert
.
<EOS>
I
notice
throughout
,
that
he
keep
everything
under
his
own
hand
,
and
distribute
everything
himself
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
bookcase
in
the
room
;
I
see
,
from
the
back
of
the
book
,
that
they
be
about
evidence
,
criminal
law
,
criminal
biography
,
trial
,
act
of
parliament
,
and
such
thing
.
<EOS>
the
furniture
be
all
very
solid
and
good
,
like
his
watch
-
chain
.
<EOS>
It
have
an
official
look
,
however
,
and
there
be
nothing
merely
ornamental
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
in
a
corner
,
be
a
little
table
of
paper
with
a
shaded
lamp
:
so
that
he
seem
to
bring
the
office
home
with
him
in
that
respect
too
,
and
to
wheel
it
out
of
an
evening
and
fall
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
have
scarcely
see
my
three
companion
until
now
---
for
,
he
and
I
have
walk
together
---
he
stand
on
the
hearth
-
rug
,
after
ring
the
bell
,
and
take
a
searching
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
to
my
surprise
,
he
seem
at
once
to
be
principally
if
not
solely
interested
in
Drummle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pip
,
"
say
he
,
put
his
large
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
move
me
to
the
window
,
"
I
do
not
know
one
from
the
other
.
<EOS>
who
be
the
Spider
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
spider
?
"
say
I.
  
"
the
blotchy
,
sprawly
,
sulky
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
Bentley
Drummle
,
"
I
reply
;
"
the
one
with
the
delicate
face
be
startop
.
"
  
<EOS>
not
make
the
least
account
of
"
the
one
with
the
delicate
face
,
"
he
return
,
"
Bentley
Drummle
be
his
name
,
be
it
?
<EOS>
I
like
the
look
of
that
fellow
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
immediately
begin
to
talk
to
Drummle
:
not
at
all
deter
by
his
replying
in
his
heavy
reticent
way
,
but
apparently
lead
on
by
it
to
screw
discourse
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
look
at
the
two
,
when
there
come
between
me
and
them
,
the
housekeeper
,
with
the
first
dish
for
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
of
about
forty
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
---
<EOS>
but
I
may
have
think
her
young
than
she
be
.
<EOS>
rather
tall
,
of
a
lithe
nimble
figure
,
extremely
pale
,
with
large
fade
eye
,
and
a
quantity
of
streaming
hair
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
whether
any
disease
affection
of
the
heart
cause
her
lip
to
be
part
as
if
she
be
pant
,
and
her
face
to
bear
a
curious
expression
of
suddenness
and
flutter
;
but
I
know
that
I
have
be
to
see
Macbeth
at
the
theatre
,
a
night
or
two
before
,
and
that
her
face
look
to
me
as
if
it
be
all
disturb
by
fiery
air
,
like
the
face
I
have
see
rise
out
of
the
witch
'
caldron
.
  
<EOS>
She
set
the
dish
on
,
touch
my
guardian
quietly
on
the
arm
with
a
finger
to
notify
that
dinner
be
ready
,
and
vanish
.
<EOS>
We
take
our
seat
at
the
round
table
,
and
my
guardian
keep
Drummle
on
one
side
of
him
,
while
Startop
sit
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
noble
dish
of
fish
that
the
housekeeper
have
put
on
table
,
and
we
have
a
joint
of
equally
choice
mutton
afterwards
,
and
then
an
equally
choice
bird
.
<EOS>
sauce
,
wine
,
all
the
accessory
we
want
,
and
all
of
the
good
,
be
give
out
by
our
host
from
his
dumb
-
waiter
;
and
when
they
have
make
the
circuit
of
the
table
,
he
always
put
them
back
again
.
<EOS>
similarly
,
he
deal
us
clean
plate
and
knife
and
fork
,
for
each
course
,
and
drop
those
just
disuse
into
two
basket
on
the
ground
by
his
chair
.
<EOS>
no
other
attendant
than
the
housekeeper
appear
.
<EOS>
She
set
on
every
dish
;
and
I
always
see
in
her
face
,
a
face
rise
out
of
the
caldron
.
<EOS>
year
afterwards
,
I
make
a
dreadful
likeness
of
that
woman
,
by
cause
a
face
that
have
no
other
natural
resemblance
to
it
than
it
derive
from
flow
hair
,
to
pass
behind
a
bowl
of
flaming
spirit
in
a
dark
room
.
  
<EOS>
induce
to
take
particular
notice
of
the
housekeeper
,
both
by
her
own
striking
appearance
and
by
Wemmick
's
preparation
,
I
observe
that
whenever
she
be
in
the
room
,
she
keep
her
eye
attentively
on
my
guardian
,
and
that
she
would
remove
her
hand
from
any
dish
she
put
before
him
,
hesitatingly
,
as
if
she
dread
his
call
her
back
,
and
want
him
to
speak
when
she
be
nigh
,
if
he
have
anything
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
that
I
could
detect
in
his
manner
a
consciousness
of
this
,
and
a
purpose
of
always
hold
her
in
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
dinner
go
off
gaily
,
and
,
although
my
guardian
seem
to
follow
rather
than
originate
subject
,
I
know
that
he
wrench
the
weak
part
of
our
disposition
out
of
us
.
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
find
that
I
be
express
my
tendency
to
lavish
expenditure
,
and
to
patronize
Herbert
,
and
to
boast
of
my
great
prospect
,
before
I
quite
know
that
I
have
open
my
lip
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
with
all
of
us
,
but
with
no
one
more
than
Drummle
:
the
development
of
whose
inclination
to
gird
in
a
grudging
and
suspicious
way
at
the
rest
,
be
screw
out
of
him
before
the
fish
be
take
off
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
then
,
but
when
we
have
get
to
the
cheese
,
that
our
conversation
turn
upon
our
rowing
feat
,
and
that
Drummle
be
rally
for
come
up
behind
of
a
night
in
that
slow
amphibious
way
of
his
.
<EOS>
Drummle
upon
this
,
inform
our
host
that
he
much
prefer
our
room
to
our
company
,
and
that
as
to
skill
he
be
more
than
our
master
,
and
that
as
to
strength
he
could
scatter
us
like
chaff
.
<EOS>
by
some
invisible
agency
,
my
guardian
wind
him
up
to
a
pitch
little
short
of
ferocity
about
this
trifle
;
and
he
fall
to
bare
and
span
his
arm
to
show
how
muscular
it
be
,
and
we
all
fall
to
bare
and
span
our
arm
in
a
ridiculous
manner
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
the
housekeeper
be
at
that
time
clear
the
table
;
my
guardian
,
take
no
heed
of
her
,
but
with
the
side
of
his
face
turn
from
her
,
be
lean
back
in
his
chair
bite
the
side
of
his
forefinger
and
show
an
interest
in
Drummle
,
that
,
to
me
,
be
quite
inexplicable
.
<EOS>
suddenly
,
he
clap
his
large
hand
on
the
housekeeper
's
,
like
a
trap
,
as
she
stretch
it
across
the
table
.
<EOS>
so
suddenly
and
smartly
do
he
do
this
,
that
we
all
stop
in
our
foolish
contention
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
talk
of
strength
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
"
I
will
show
you
a
wrist
.
<EOS>
molly
,
let
them
see
your
wrist
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
entrapped
hand
be
on
the
table
,
but
she
have
already
put
her
other
hand
behind
her
waist
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Master
,
"
she
say
,
in
a
low
voice
,
with
her
eye
attentively
and
entreatingly
fix
upon
him
.
"
<EOS>
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
show
you
a
wrist
,
"
repeat
Mr
Jaggers
,
with
an
immovable
determination
to
show
it
.
"
<EOS>
molly
,
let
them
see
your
wrist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Master
,
"
she
again
murmur
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
please
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Molly
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
not
look
at
her
,
but
obstinately
look
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
,
"
let
them
see
 
\
<EOS>
both
\
 
your
wrist
.
<EOS>
show
them
.
<EOS>
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
his
hand
from
hers
,
and
turn
that
wrist
up
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
She
bring
her
other
hand
from
behind
her
,
and
hold
the
two
out
side
by
side
.
<EOS>
the
last
wrist
be
much
disfigure
---
deeply
scar
and
scar
across
and
across
.
<EOS>
when
she
hold
her
hand
out
,
she
take
her
eye
from
Mr
Jaggers
,
and
turn
them
watchfully
on
every
one
of
the
rest
of
us
in
succession
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
power
here
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
coolly
trace
out
the
sinew
with
his
forefinger
.
<EOS>
"
very
few
man
have
the
power
of
wrist
that
this
woman
have
.
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
what
mere
force
of
grip
there
be
in
these
hand
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
occasion
to
notice
many
hand
;
but
I
never
see
strong
in
that
respect
,
man
's
or
woman
's
,
than
these
.
  
<EOS>
while
he
say
these
word
in
a
leisurely
critical
style
,
she
continue
to
look
at
every
one
of
us
in
regular
succession
as
we
sit
.
<EOS>
the
moment
he
cease
,
she
look
at
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
that
will
do
,
Molly
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
give
her
a
slight
nod
;
"
you
have
be
admire
,
and
can
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
withdraw
her
hand
and
go
out
of
the
room
,
and
Mr
Jaggers
,
put
the
decanter
on
from
his
dumb
-
waiter
,
fill
his
glass
and
pass
round
the
wine
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
half
-
past
nine

gentleman

"
say
he
,
"
we
must
break
up

<EOS>
pray
make
the
good
use
of
your

<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
see
you
all
.
<EOS>
Mr
Drummle
,
I
drink
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
if
his
object
in
single
out
Drummle
be
to
bring
him
out
still
more
,
it
perfectly
succeed
.
<EOS>
in
a
sulky
triumph
,
Drummle
show
his
morose
depreciation
of
the
rest
of
us
,
in
a
more
and
more
offensive
degree
until
he
become
downright
intolerable
.
<EOS>
through
all
his
stage
,
Mr
Jaggers
follow
him
with
the
same
strange
interest
.
<EOS>
He
actually
seem
to
serve
as
a
zest
to
Mr
Jaggers
's
wine
.

in
our
boyish
want
of
discretion
<EOS>
I
dare
<EOS>
say
we
take
too
much
to
drink
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
we
talk
too
much
.
<EOS>
We
become
particularly
hot
upon
some
boorish
sneer
of
Drummle
's
,
to
the
effect
that
we
be
too
free
with
our
money
.
<EOS>
It
lead
to
my
remarking
,
with
more
zeal
than
discretion
,
that
it
come
with
a
bad
grace
from
him
,
to
whom
Startop
have
lend
money
in
my
presence
but
a
week
or
so
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
"
retort
Drummle
;
"
he
will
be
pay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
he
will
not
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
it
may
make
you
hold
your
tongue
about
us
and
our
money
,
I
should
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
You
\
 
should
think
!
"
<EOS>
retort
Drummle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
Lord
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
"
I
go
on
,
mean
to
be
very
severe
,
"
that
you
would
not
lend
money
to
any
of
us
,
if
we
want
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
"
say
Drummle
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
lend
one
of
you
a
sixpence
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
lend
anybody
a
sixpence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
rather
mean
to
borrow
under
those
circumstance
,
I
should
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
\
<EOS>
You
<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
should
say
,
"
repeat
Drummle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
Lord
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
so
very
aggravating
---
the
more
especially
as
I
find
myself
make
no
way
against
his
surly
obtuseness
---
that
I
say
,
disregard
Herbert
's
effort
to
check
me
:
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
Mr
Drummle
,
since
we
be
on
the
subject
,
I
will
tell
you
what
pass
between
Herbert
here
and
me
,
when
you
borrow
that
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
know
what
pass
between
Herbert
there
<EOS>
and
you
,
"
growl
Drummle
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
he
add
in
a
low
growl
,
that
we
may
both
go
to
the
devil
and
shake
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
however
,
"
say
I
,
"
whether
you
want
to
know
or
not
.
<EOS>
We
say
that
as
you
put
it
in
your
pocket
very
glad
to
get
it
,
you
seem
to
be
immensely
amuse
at
his
be
so
weak
as
to
lend
it
.

<EOS>
Drummle
laugh
outright
,
and
sit
laugh
in
our
face
,
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
his
round
shoulder
raise
:
plainly
signify
that
it
be
quite
true
,
and
that
he
despise
us
,
as
ass
all
.
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
Startop
take
him
in
hand
,
though
with
a
much
well
grace
than
I
have
show
,
and
exhort
him
to
be
a
little
more
agreeable
.
<EOS>
startop
,
be
a
lively
bright
young
fellow
,
and
Drummle
be
the
exact
opposite
,
the
latter
be
always
disposed
to
resent
him
as
a
direct
personal
affront
.
<EOS>
He
now
retort
in
a
coarse
lumpish
way
,
and
Startop
try
to
turn
the
discussion
aside
with
some
small
pleasantry
that
make
us
all
laugh
.
<EOS>
resent
this
little
success
more
than
anything
,
Drummle
,
without
any
threat
or
warning
,
pull
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
,
drop
his
round
shoulder
,
swore
,
take
up
a
large
glass
,
and
would
have
fling
it
at
his
adversary
's
head
,
but
for
our
entertainer
's
dexterously
seize
it
at
the
instant
when
it
be
raise
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
deliberately
put
down
the
glass
,
and
haul
out
his
gold
repeater
by
its
massive
chain
,
"
I
be
exceedingly
sorry
to
announce
that
it
be
half
-
past
nine

"
  
<EOS>
on
this
hint
we
all
rise
to
depart
.
<EOS>
before
we
get
to
the
street
door
,
Startop
be
cheerily
call
Drummle
"
old
boy
,
"
as
if
nothing
have
happen
.
<EOS>
but
the
old
boy
be
so
far
from
respond
,
that
he
would
not
even
walk
to
Hammersmith
on
the
same
side
of
the
way
;
so
,
Herbert
and
I
,
who
remain
in

,
see
them
go
down
the
street
on

side
;
startop

Drummle
lag
behind
in
the
shadow
of
the

much
as
he
be
will
not

follow
in
his
boat

<EOS>
as
the
door
be
not
yet
shut

I
think
I
would
leave
Herbert
there
for
a
moment
,
and
run
up

stair
again
to
say
a
word
to
my
guardian

I
find
him
in
his
dressing

room
surround
by
his
stock
of
boot

already
hard
at
it

wash
his

I
tell
him
I
have
come
up
again
to
say
how
sorry
I
be
that
anything
disagreeable
should
have
occur
,
and
that
I
hope
he
would
not
blame
me
much

"

sluice
his

"
<EOS>
\
   
<EOS>
I
receive
this
letter
by
post
on
Monday
morning
,
and
therefore
its
appointment
be
for
next
day
.
<EOS>
let
me
confess
exactly
,
with
what
feeling
I
look
forward
to
Joe
's
come
.
  
<EOS>
not
with
pleasure
,
though
I
be
bind
to
him
by
so
many
tie
;
no
;
with
considerable
disturbance
,
some
mortification
,
and
a
keen
sense
of
incongruity
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
have
keep
him
away
by
pay
money
,
I
certainly
would
have
pay
money
.
<EOS>
My
great
reassurance
be
,
that
he
be
come
to
Barnard
's
Inn
,
not
to
Hammersmith
,
and
consequently
would
not
fall
in
Bentley
Drummle
's
way
.
<EOS>
I
have
little
objection
to
his
be
see
by
Herbert
or
his
father
,
for
both
of
whom
I
have
a
respect
;
but
I
have
the
sharp
sensitiveness
as
to
his
be
see
by
Drummle
,
whom
I
hold
in
contempt
.
<EOS>
so
,
throughout
life
,
our
bad
weakness
and
meanness
be
usually
commit
for
the
sake
of
the
people
whom
we
most
despise
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
begin
to
be
always
decorate
the
chamber
in
some
quite
unnecessary
and
inappropriate
way
or
other
,
and
very
expensive
those
wrestle
with
Barnard
prove
to
be
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
the
room
be
vastly
different
from
what
I
have
find
them
,
and
I
enjoy
the
honour
of
occupy
a
few
prominent
page
in
the
book
of
a
neighbouring
upholsterer
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
on
so
fast
of
late
,
that
I
have
even
start
a
boy
in
boot
---
top
boot
---
in
bondage
and
slavery
to
whom
I
may
have
be
say
to
pass
my
day
.
<EOS>
for
,
after
I
have
make
the
monster
(
out
of
the
refuse
of
my
washerwoman
's
family
)
and
have
clothe
him
with
a
blue
coat
,
canary
waistcoat
,
white
cravat
,
creamy
breech
,
and
the
boot
already
mention
,
I
have
to
find
him
a
little
to
do
and
a
great
deal
to
eat
;
and
with
both
of
those
horrible
requirement
he
haunt
my
existence
.
  
<EOS>
this
avenge
phantom
be
order
to
be
on
duty
at
eight
on
Tuesday
morning
in
the
hall
(
it
be
two
foot
square
,
as
charge
for
floorcloth
)
,
and
Herbert
suggest
certain
thing
for
breakfast
that
he
think
Joe
would
like
.
<EOS>
while
I
feel
sincerely
oblige
to
him
for
be
so
interested
and
considerate
,
I
have
an
odd
half
-
provoked
sense
of
suspicion
upon
me
,
that
if
Joe
have
be
come
to
see
 
\
him
,
\
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
have
be
quite
so
brisk
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
I
come
into
town
on
the
Monday
night
to
be
ready
for
Joe
,
and
I
get
up
early
in
the
morning
,
and
cause
the
sitting
-
room
and
breakfast
-
table
to
assume
their
most
splendid
appearance
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
the
morning
be
drizzly
,
and
an
angel
could
not
have
conceal
the
fact
that
Barnard
be
shed
sooty
tear
outside
the
window
,
like
some
weak
giant
of
a
Sweep
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
time
approach
I
should
have
like
to
run
away
,
but
the
Avenger
pursuant
to
order
be
in
the
hall
,
and
presently
I
hear
Joe
on
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
Joe
,
by
his
clumsy
manner
of
come
up
-
stair
---
<EOS>
his
state
boot
be
always
too
big
for
him
---
and
by
the
time
it
take
him
to
read
the
name
on
the
other
floor
in
the
course
of
his
ascent
.
<EOS>
when
at
last
he
stop
outside
our
door
,
I
could
hear
his
finger
trace
over
the
paint
letter
of
my
name
,
and
I
afterwards
distinctly
hear
him
breathe
in
at
the
keyhole
.
<EOS>
finally
he
give
a
faint
single
rap
,
and
Pepper
---
<EOS>
such
be
the
compromise
name
of
the
avenging
boy
---
<EOS>
announce
"
Mr
Gargery
!
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
never
would
have
do
wipe
his
foot
,
and
that
I
must
have
go
out
to
lift
him
off
the
mat
,
but
at
last
he
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joe
,
how
be
you
,
Joe
?

<EOS>
"
Pip

how
AIR
you

with
his
good
honest
face
all
glow
and
shine
,
and
his
hat
put
down
on
the
floor
between
us
,
he
catch
both
my
hand
and
work
them
straight
up
and
down
,
as
if
I
have

the

I

Joe

take
it
up
carefully

there
a

<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
Joe
,
"
yes

there
certainly
be
a
peck
of
orange

peel

<EOS>
Partickler
,
when
he
see
the
ghost

<EOS>
though
I
put
it
to
yourself
,

whether
it
be
calc'late
to
keep
a

up
to
his
work
with
a
good
hart
,
to
be
continiwally
cut
in
betwixt
him
and
the
ghost
with
"
amen

"
<EOS>
a
man
may
have
have
a
misfortun

and
be
in
the
Church
,
"
say
Joe
,
lower
his
voice
to
an
argumentative
and
feel
tone
,
"
but
that
be
no
reason
why
you
should
put
him
out
at
such
a
time
.
<EOS>
which
I
meantersay
,
if
the
ghost
of
a
man
's
own
father
can
not
be
allow
to
claim
his
attention
,
what
can
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
still
more
,
when
his
mourning
"
at
be
unfortunately
make
so
small
as
that
the
weight
of
the
black
feather
bring
it
off
,
try
to
keep
it
on
how
you
may
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
ghost
-
see
effect
in
Joe
's
own
countenance
inform
me
that
Herbert
have
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
present
Joe
to
Herbert
,
who
hold
out
his
hand
;
but
Joe
back
from
it
,
and
hold
on
by
the
bird's

nest

<EOS>
"
Your

Joe

I
hope
as

here
his
eye
fall
on
the
Avenger
,
who
be
put
some
toast
on
table
,

so
plainly
denote
an
intention
to
make
that
young

one

frown
it
down

Joe
,
confidentially
,
"
and
I
believe
its
character
do
stand

I
would
not
keep
a

not
in
the
case

I
wish
him

fatten
wholesome
and
to

a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
bear
this
flattering
testimony

incidentally
show
this
tendency

sit
down

look
all
round
the
room
for

suitable
spot
on

as
if
it

only
on
some
very
few
rare

stand

<EOS>

Thankee
,
Sir

return
Joe

evidently
dispirit
by
the
proposal
,
"
since

so
kind

tea

pour

out

<EOS>
here
Joe

tumble
off

mantel

piece
,
and
he
start
out
of
his
chair
and
pick
it
up
,
and
fit
it
to
the
same
exact
spot

<EOS>
as
if
it
be
an
absolute
point

it

tumble
off
again
soon

after

with

relief

strict
impartiality

have
you
see
anything

<EOS>
"
why
,
yes

Joe
,
"
me
and
Wopsle
go
off
straight
to

Blacking
Ware'us

we
do
not
find
that

come
up
to
its
likeness
in
the
red
bill
at

shop
door
;
which
I
meantersay
,
"
add
Joe
,
in
an
explanatory
manner
,
"
as
it
be
there
drawd
too
architectooralooral
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
really
believe
Joe
would
have
prolong
this
word
(
mightily
expressive
to
my
mind
of
some
architecture
that
I
know
)
into
a
perfect
Chorus
,
but
for
his
attention
be
providentially
attract
by
his
hat
,
which
be
topple
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
demand
from
him
a
constant
attention
,
and
a
quickness
of
eye
and
hand
,
very
like
that
exact
by
wicket
-
keeping
.
<EOS>
He
make
extraordinary
play
with
it
,
and
show
the
great
skill
;
now
,
rush
at
it
and
catch
it
neatly
as
it
drop
;
now
,
merely
stop
it
midway
,
beat
it
up
,
and
humour
it
in
various
part
of
the
room
and
against
a
good
deal
of
the
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
,
before
he
feel
it
safe
to
close
with
it
;
finally
,
splash
it
into
the
slop
-
basin
,
where
I
take
the
liberty
of
lay
hand
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
his
shirt
-
collar
,
and
his
coat
-
collar
,
they
be
perplex
to
reflect
upon
---
insoluble
mystery
both
.
<EOS>
why
should
a
man
scrape
himself
to
that
extent
,
before
he
could
consider
himself
full
dress
?
<EOS>
why
should
he
suppose
it
necessary
to
be
purify
by
suffer
for
his
holiday
clothe
?
<EOS>
then
he
fall
into
such
unaccountable
fit
of
meditation
,
with
his
fork
midway
between
his
plate
and
his
mouth
;
have
his
eye
attract
in
such
strange
direction
;
be
afflict
with
such
remarkable
cough
;
sit
so
fur
from
the
table
,
and
drop
so
much
more
than
he
eat
,
and
pretend
that
he
have
not
drop
it
;
that
I
be
heartily
glad
when
Herbert
leave
us
for
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
neither
the
good
sense
nor
the
good
feeling
to
know
that
this
be
all
my
fault
,
and
that
if
I
have
be
easy
with
Joe
,
Joe
would
have
be
easy
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
impatient
of
him
and
out
of
temper
with
him
;
in
which
condition
he
heap
coal
of
fire
on
my
head

<EOS>
Joe
look
at
me
for
a
single
instant
with
something
faintly
like
reproach
.
<EOS>
utterly
preposterous
as
his
cravat
be
,
and
as
his
collar
be
,
I
be
conscious
of
a
sort
of
dignity
in
the
look

at
Joe
's
.
<EOS>
but
,
when
I
have
secure
my
box
-
place
by
to
-
morrow
's
coach
and
have
be
down
to
Mr
Pocket
's
and
back
,
I
be
not
by
any
mean
convince
on
the
last
point
,
and
begin
to
invent
reason
and
make
excuse
for
put
up
at
the
Blue
Boar
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
an
inconvenience
at
Joe
's
;
I
be
not
expect
,
and
my
bed
would
not
be
ready
;
I
should
be
too
far
from
Miss
Havisham
's
,
and
she
be
exact
and
might
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
all
other
swindler
upon
earth
be
nothing
to
the
self
-
swindler
,
and
with
such
pretence
do
I
cheat
myself
.
<EOS>
surely
a
curious
thing
.
<EOS>
that
I
should
innocently
take
a
bad
half
-
crown
of
somebody
else
's
manufacture
,
be
reasonable
enough
;
but
that
I
should
knowingly
reckon
the
spurious
coin
of
my
own
make
,
as
good
money
!
<EOS>
an
obliging
stranger
,
under
pretence
of
compactly
fold
up
my
bank
-
note
for
security
's
sake
,
abstract
the
note
and
give
me
nutshell
;
but
what
be
his
sleight
of
hand
to
mine
,
when
I
fold
up
my
own
nutshell
and
pass
them
on
myself
as
note
!
  
<EOS>
have
settle
that
I
must
go
to
the
Blue
Boar
,
my
mind
be
much
disturb
by
indecision
whether
or
no
to
take
the
Avenger
.
<EOS>
It
be
tempt
to
think
of
that
expensive
Mercenary
publicly
air
his
boot
in
the
archway
of
the
Blue
Boar
's
posting
-
yard
;
it
be
almost
solemn
to
imagine
him
casually
produce
in
the
tailor
's
shop
and
confound
the
disrespectful
sense
of
Trabb
's
boy
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
Trabb
's
boy
may
worm
himself
into
his
intimacy
and
tell
him
thing
;
or
,
reckless
and
desperate
wretch
as
I
know
he
could
be
,
may
hoot
him
in
the
high
-
street
.
<EOS>
My
patroness
,
too
,
may
hear
of
him
,
and
not
approve
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
I
resolve
to
leave
the
Avenger
behind
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
afternoon
coach
by
which
I
have
take
my
place
,
and
,
as
winter
have
now
come
round
,
I
should
not
arrive
at
my
destination
until
two
or
three
hour
after
dark
.
<EOS>
Our
time
of
start
from
the
Cross
Keys
be
two
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
arrive
on
the
ground
with
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
spare
,
attend
by
the
Avenger
---
if
I
may
connect
that
expression
with
one
who
never
attend
on
me
if
he
could
possibly
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
time
it
be
customary
to
carry
convict
down
to
the
dockyard
by
stage
-
coach
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
often
hear
of
them
in
the
capacity
of
outside
passenger
,
and
have
more
than
once
see
them
on
the
high
road
dangle
their
iron
leg
over
the
coach
roof
,
I
have
no
cause
to
be
surprised
when
Herbert
,
meet
me
in
the
yard
,
come
up
and
tell
me
there
be
two
convict
go
down
with
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
reason
that
be
an
old
reason
now
,
for
constitutionally
falter
whenever
I
hear
the
word
convict
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mind
them
,
Handel
?
"
say
Herbert
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
seem
as
if
you
do
not
like
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
pretend
that
I
do
like
them
,
and
I
suppose
you
do
not
particularly
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
mind
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
see
!
<EOS>
there
they
be
,
"
say
Herbert
,
"
come
out
of
the
Tap
.
<EOS>
what
a
degraded
and
vile
sight
it
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
have
be
treat
their
guard
,
I
suppose
,
for
they
have
a
gaoler
with
them
,
and
all
three
come
out
wipe
their
mouth
on
their
hand
.
<EOS>
the
two
convict
be
handcuff
together
,
and
have
iron
on
their
leg
---
iron
of
a
pattern
that
I
know
well
.
<EOS>
They
wear
the
dress
that
I
likewise
know
well
.
<EOS>
Their
keeper
have
a
brace
of
pistol
,
and
carry
a
thick
-
knob
bludgeon
under
his
arm
;
but
he
be
on
term
of
good
understanding
with
them
,
and
stand
,
with
them
beside
him
,
look
on
at
the
putting
-
to
of
the
horse
,
rather
with
an
air
as
if
the
convict
be
an
interesting
exhibition
not
formally
open
at
the
moment
,
and
he
the
Curator
.
<EOS>
one
be
a
tall
and
stouter
man
than
the
other
,
and
appear
as
a
matter
of
course
,
accord
to
the
mysterious
way
of
the
world
both
convict
and
free
,
to
have
have
allot
to
him
the
small
suit
of
clothe
.
<EOS>
His
arm
and
leg
be
like
great
pincushion
of
those
shape
,
and
his
attire
disguise
him
absurdly
;
but
I
know
his
half
-
closed
eye
at
one
glance
.
<EOS>
there
stand
the
man
whom
I
have
see
on
the
settle
at
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
on
a
Saturday
night
,
and
who
have
bring
me
down
with
his
invisible
gun
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
make
sure
that
as
yet
he
know
me
no
more
than
if
he
have
never
see
me
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
look
across
at
me
,
and
his
eye
appraise
my
watch
-
chain
,
and
then
he
incidentally
spit
and
say
something
to
the
other
convict
,
and
they
laugh
and
slue
themselves
round
with
a
clink
of
their
coupling
manacle
,
and
look
at
something
else
.
<EOS>
the
great
number
on
their
back
,
as
if
they
be
street
door
;
their
coarse
mangy
ungainly
outer
surface
,
as
if
they
be
low
animal
;
their
iron
leg
,
apologetically
garland
with
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
;
and
the
way
in
which
all
present
look
at
them
and
keep
from
them
;
make
them
(
as
Herbert
have
say
)
<EOS>
a
most
disagreeable
and
degraded
spectacle
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
bad
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
come
out
that
the
whole
of
the
back
of
the
coach
have
be
take
by
a
family
remove
from
London
,
and
that
there
be
no
place
for
the
two
prisoner
but
on
the
seat
in
front
,
behind
the
coachman
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
a
choleric
gentleman
,
who
have
take
the
fourth
place
on
that
seat
,
fly
into
a
most
violent
passion
,
and
say
that
it
be
a
breach
of
contract
to
mix
him
up
with
such
villainous
company
,
and
that
it
be
poisonous
and
pernicious
and
infamous
and
shameful
,
and
I
do
not
know
what
else
.
<EOS>
at
this
time
the
coach
be
ready
and
the
coachman
impatient
,
and
we
be
all
prepare
to
get
up
,
and
the
prisoner
have
come
over
with
their
keeper
---
bring
with
them
that
curious
flavour
of
bread
-
poultice
,
baize
,
rope
-
yarn
,
and
hearthstone
,
which
attend
the
convict
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
take
it
so
much
<EOS>
amiss
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
plead
the
keeper
to
the
angry
passenger
;
"
I
will
sit
next
you
myself
.
<EOS>
I
will
put
'em
on
the
outside
of
the
row
.
<EOS>
They
will
not
interfere
with
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
know
they
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
not
blame
 
\
me
,
"
\
 
<EOS>
growl
the
convict
I
have
recognize
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
ready
to
stay
behind
.
<EOS>
as
fur
as
I
be
concern
any
one
's
welcome
to
 
\
<EOS>
my
\
 
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
or
mine
,
"
say
the
other
,
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
have
incommode
none
of
you
,
if
I
would
a
have
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
then
,
they
both
laugh
,
and
begin
crack
nut
,
and
spit
the
shell
about
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
as
I
really
think
I
should
have
like
to
do
myself
,
if
I
have
be
in
their
place
and
so
despised
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
it
be
vote
that
there
be
no
help
for
the
angry
gentleman
,
and
that
he
must
either
go
in
his
chance
company
or
remain
behind
.
<EOS>
so
,
he
get
into
his
place
,
still
make
complaint
,
and
the
keeper
get
into
the
place
next
him
,
and
the
convict
haul
themselves
up
as
well
as
they
could
,
and
the
convict
I
have
recognize
sit
behind
me
with
his
breath
on
the
hair
of
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
bye
,
Handel
!
"
<EOS>
Herbert
call
out
as
we
start
.
<EOS>
I
think
what
a
blessed
fortune
it
be
,
that
he
have
find
another
name
for
me
than
Pip
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
express
with
what
acuteness
<EOS>
I
feel
the
convict
's
breathing
,
not
only
on
the
back
of
my
head
,
but
all
along
my
spine
.
<EOS>
the
sensation
be
like
be
touch
in
the
marrow
with
some
pungent
and
search
acid
,
and
it
set
my
very
tooth
on
edge
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
more
breathing
business
to
do
than
another
man
,
and
to
make
more
noise
in
do
it
;
and
I
be
conscious
of
grow
high
-
shoulder
on
one
side
,
in
my
shrink
endeavour
to
fend
him
off
.
  
<EOS>
the
weather
be
miserably
raw
,
and
the
two
curse
the
cold
.
<EOS>
It
make
us
all
lethargic
before
we
have
go
far
,
and
when
we
have
leave
the
half
-
way
House
behind
,
we
habitually
doze
and
shiver
and
be
silent
.
<EOS>
I
doze
off
,
myself
,
in
consider
the
question
whether
I
ought
to
restore
a
couple
of
pound
sterling
to
this
creature
before
lose
sight
of
him
,
and
how
it
could
best
be
do
.
<EOS>
in
the
act
of
dip
forward
as
if
I
be
go
to
bathe
among
the
horse
,
I
wake
in
a
fright
and
take
the
question
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
must
have
lose
it
longer
than
I
have
think
,
since
,
although
I
could
recognize
nothing
in
the
darkness
and
the
fitful
light
and
shadow
of
our
lamp
,
I
trace
marsh
country
in
the
cold
damp
wind
that
blow
at
us
.
<EOS>
cower
forward
for
warmth
and
to
make
me
a
screen
against
the
wind
,
the
convict
be
close
to
me
than
before
.
<EOS>
the
very
first
word
I
hear
them
interchange
as
I
become
conscious
be
the
word
of
my
own
thought
,
"
two
one
Pound
note
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
he
get
'
em
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
convict
I
have
never
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
should
I
know
?
"
return
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
'em
stow
away
somehow
.
<EOS>
giv
him
by
friend
<EOS>
,
I
expect
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
wish
,
"
say
the
other
,
with
a
bitter
curse
upon
the
cold
,
"
that
I
have
'em
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
two
one
pound
note
,
or
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
two
one
pound
note
.
<EOS>
I
would
sell
all
the
friend
I
ever
have
,
for
one
,
and
think
it
a
blessed
good
bargain
.
<EOS>
well
?
<EOS>
so
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
he
say
,
"
resume
the
convict
I
have
recognize
---
"
it
be
all
say
and
do
in
half
a
minute
,
behind
a
pile
of
timber
in
the
Dockyard

"
<EOS>
You
be
a
go
to
be
discharge
?
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
.
<EOS>
Would
I
find
out
that
boy
that
have
feed
him
and
kep
his
secret
,
and
give
him
them
two
one
pound
note
?
<EOS>
yes
,
I
would
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
fool
you
,
"
growl
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
spend
'em
on
a
man
,
in
wittle
and
drink
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
be
a
green
one
.
<EOS>
mean
to
say
he
know
nothing
of
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
a
ha'porth
.
<EOS>
different
gang
and
different
ship
.
<EOS>
He
be
try
again
for
prison
breaking
,
and
get
make
a
Lifer
.
"
  
"
and
be
that
---
honour
!
---
<EOS>
the
only
time
you
work
out
,
in
this
part
of
the
country
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
only
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
may
have
be
your
opinion
of
the
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
most
beastly
place
.
<EOS>
mudbank
,
mist
,
swamp
,
and
work
;
work
,
swamp
,
mist
,
and
mudbank
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
both
execrate
the
place
in
very
strong
language
,
and
gradually
growl
themselves
out
,
and
have
nothing
leave
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
after
overhear
this
dialogue
,
I
should
assuredly
have
get
down
and
be
leave
in
the
solitude
and
darkness
of
the
highway
,
but
for
feel
certain
that
the
man
have
no
suspicion
of
my
identity
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
not
only
so
change
in
the
course
of
nature
,
but
so
differently
dressed
and
<EOS>
so
differently
circumstance
,
that
it
be
not
at
all
likely
he
could
have
know
me
without
accidental
help
.
<EOS>
still
,
the
coincidence
of
our
be
together
on
the
coach
,
be
sufficiently
strange
to
fill
me
with
a
dread
that
some
other
coincidence
may
at
any
moment
connect
me
,
in
his
hearing
,
with
my
name
.
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
I
resolve
to
alight
as
soon
as
we
touch
the
town
,
and
put
myself
out
of
his
hearing
.
<EOS>
this
device
I
execute
successfully
.
<EOS>
My
little
portmanteau
be
in
the
boot
under
my
foot
;
I
have
but
to
turn
a
hinge
to
get
it
out
;
I
throw
it
down
before
me
,
get
down
after
it
,
and
be
leave
at
the
first
lamp
on
the
first
stone
of
the
town
pavement
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
convict
,
they
go
their
way
with
the
coach
,
and
I
know
at
what
point
they
would
be
spirit
off
to
the
river
.
<EOS>
in
my
fancy
,
I
see
the
boat
with
its
convict
crew
wait
for
them
at
the
slime
-
washed
stair
,
---
again
hear
the
gruff
"
give
way
,
you
!
"
<EOS>
like
an
order
to
dog
---
again
see
the
wicked
Noah
's
Ark
lie
out
on
the
black
water
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
say
what
I
be
afraid
of
,
for
my
fear
be
altogether
undefined
and
vague
,
but
there
be
great
fear
upon
me
.
<EOS>
as
I
walk
on
to
the
hotel
,
I
feel
that
a
dread
,
much
exceed
the
mere
apprehension
of
a
painful
or
disagreeable
recognition
,
make
me
tremble
.
<EOS>
I
be
confident
that
it
take
no
distinctness
of
shape
,
and
that
it
be
the
revival
for
a
few
minute
of
the
terror
of
childhood
.
  
<EOS>
the
coffee
-
room
at
the
Blue
Boar
be
empty
,
and
I
have
not
only
order
my
dinner
there
,
but
have
sit
down
to
it
,
before
the
waiter
know
me
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
apologize
for
the
remissness
of
his
memory
,
he
ask
me
if
he
should
send
boot
for
Mr
Pumblechook
?
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
I
,
"
certainly
not

<EOS>
the
waiter
(
it
be
he
who
have
bring
up
the
Great
Remonstrance
from
the
Commercials
,
on
the
day
when
I
be
bind
)
appear
surprised
,
and
take
the
early
opportunity
of
put
a
dirty
old
copy
of
a
local
newspaper
so
directly
in
my
way
,
that
I
take
it
up
and
read
this
paragraph
:
  
Our
reader
will
learn
,
not
altogether
without
interest
,
in
reference
to
the
recent
romantic
rise
in
fortune
of
a
young
artificer
in
iron
of
this
neighbourhood
(
what
a
theme
,
by
the
way
,
for
the
magic
pen
of
our
as
yet
not
universally
acknowledge
townsman
TOOBY
,
the
poet
of
our
column
!
)
<EOS>
that
the
youth
's
early
patron
,
companion
,
and
friend
,
be
a
highly
-
respect
individual
not
entirely
unconnected
with
the
corn
and
seed
trade
,
and
whose
eminently
convenient
and
commodious
business
premise
be
situate
within
a
hundred
mile
of
the
high
-
street
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
wholly
irrespective
of
our
personal
feeling
that
we
record
HIM
as
the
Mentor
of
our
young
Telemachus
,
for
it
be
good
to
know
that
our
town
produce
the
founder
of
the
latter
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
do
the
thought
-
contract
brow
of
the
local
Sage
or
the
lustrous
eye
of
local
Beauty
inquire
whose
fortune
?
<EOS>
We
believe
that
Quintin
Matsys
be
the
BLACKSMITH
of
Antwerp
.
<EOS>
VERB

<EOS>
SAP
.
  
<EOS>
I
entertain
a
conviction
,
base
upon
large
experience
,
that
if
in
the
day
of
my
prosperity
I
have
go
to
the
North
Pole
,
I
should
have
meet
somebody
there
,
wander
Esquimaux
or
civilized
man
,
who
would
have
tell
me
that
Pumblechook
be
my
early
patron
and
the
founder
of
my
fortune

<EOS>
Chapter
29
 
betime
in
the
morning
<EOS>
I
be
up
and
out
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
early
yet
to
go
to
Miss
Havisham
's
,
so
I
loiter
into
the
country
on
Miss
Havisham
's
side
of
town
---
which
be
not
Joe
's
side
;
I
could
go
there
to
-
morrow
---
think
about
my
patroness
,
and
paint
brilliant
picture
of
her
plan
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
adopt
Estella
,
she
have
as
good
as
adopt
me
,
and
it
could
not
fail
to
be
her
intention
to
bring
us
together
.
<EOS>
She
reserve
it
for
me
to
restore
the
desolate
house
,
admit
the
sunshine
into
the
dark
room
,
set
the
clock
a
going
and
the
cold
hearth
a
blazing
,
tear
down
the
cobwebs
,
destroy
the
vermin
---
in
short
,
do
all
the
shine
deed
of
the
young
Knight
of
romance
,
and
marry
the
Princess
.
<EOS>
I
have
stop
to
look
at
the
house
as
I
pass
;
and
its
seared
red
brick
wall
,
block
window
,
and
strong
green
ivy
clasp
even
the
stack
of
chimney
with
its
twig
and
tendon
,
as
if
with
sinewy
old
arm
,
have
make
up
a
rich
attractive
mystery
,
of
which
I
be
the
hero
.
<EOS>
Estella
be
the
inspiration
of
it
,
and
the
heart
of
it
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
she
have
take
such
strong
possession
of
me
,
though
my
fancy
and
my
hope
be
so
set
upon
her
,
though
her
influence
on
my
boyish
life
and
character
have
be
all
-
powerful
,
I
do
not
,
even
that
romantic
morning
,
invest
her
with
any
attribute
save
those
she
possess
.
<EOS>
I
mention
this
in
this
place
,
of
a
fix
purpose
,
because
it
be
the
clue
by
which
I
be
to
be
follow
into
my
poor
labyrinth
.
<EOS>
accord
to
my
experience
,
the
conventional
notion
of
a
lover
can
not
be
always
true
.
<EOS>
the
unqualified
truth
be
,
that
when
I
love
Estella
with
the
love
of
a
man
,
I
love
her
simply
because
I
find
her
irresistible
.
<EOS>
once
for
all
;
I
know
to
my
sorrow
,
often
and
often
,
if
not
always
,
that
I
love
her
against
reason
,
against
promise
,
against
peace
,
against
hope
,
against
happiness
,
against
all
discouragement
that
could
be
.
<EOS>
once
for
all
;
I
love
her
none
the
less
because
I
know
it
,
and
it
have
no
more
influence
in
restrain
me
,
than
if
I
have
devoutly
believe
her
to
be
human
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
I
so
shape
out
my
walk
as
to
arrive
at
the
gate
at
my
old
time
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
ring
at
the
bell
with
an
unsteady
hand
,
I
turn
my
back
upon
the
gate
,
while
I
try
to
get
my
breath
and
keep
the
beating
of
my
heart
moderately
quiet
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
side
door
open
,
and
step
come
across
the
court
-
yard
;
but
I
pretend
not
to
hear
,
even
when
the
gate
swing
on
its
rusty
hinge
.
  
<EOS>
be
at
last
touch
on
the
shoulder
,
I
start
and
turn
.
<EOS>
I
start
much
more
naturally
then
,
to
find
myself
confront
by
a
man
in
a
sober
grey
dress
.
<EOS>
the
last
man
I
should
have
expect
to
see
in
that
place
of
porter
at
Miss
Havisham
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Orlick
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
young
master
,
there
be
more
change
than
yours
.
<EOS>
but
come
in
,
come
in
.
<EOS>
It
be
oppose
to
my
order
to
hold
the
gate
open
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
enter
and
he
swing
it
,
and
lock
it
,
and
take
the
key
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
!
"
say
he
,
face
round
,
after
doggedly
precede
me
a
few
step
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
here
I
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
here
,
"
he
retort
,
"
on
my
leg
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
box
bring
alongside
me
in
a
barrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
here
for
good
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
here
for
harm
,
young
master
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
leisure
to
entertain
the
retort
in
my
mind
,
while
he
slowly
lift
his
heavy
glance
from
the
pavement
,
up
my
leg
and
arm
,
to
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
leave
the
forge
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
this
look
like
a
forge
?
"
reply
Orlick
,
send
his
glance
all
<EOS>
round
him
with
an
air
of
injury
.
<EOS>
"
now
,
do
it
look
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
ask
him
how
long
he
have
leave
Gargery
's
forge
?
  
<EOS>
"
one
day
be
so
like
another
here
,
"
he
reply
,
"
that
I
do
not
know
without
cast
it
up
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
come
here
some
time
since
you
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
tell
you
that
,
Orlick
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
he
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"
but
then
you
have
get
to
be
a
scholar
.
"
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
we
have
come
to
the
house
,
where
I
find
his
room
to
be
one
just
within
the
side
door
,
with
a
little
window
in
it
look
on
the
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
in
its
small
proportion
,
it
be
not
unlike
the
kind
of
place
usually
assign
to
a
gate
-
porter
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
certain
key
be
hang
on
the
wall
,
to
which
he
now
add
the
gate
-
key
;
and
his
patchwork
-
cover
bed
be
in
a
little
inner
division
or
recess
.
<EOS>
the
whole
have
a
slovenly
confine
and
sleepy
look
,
like
a
cage
for
a
human
dormouse
:
while
he
,
loom
dark
and
heavy
in
the
shadow
of
a
corner
by
the
window
,
look
like
the
human
dormouse
for
whom
it
be
fit
up
---
as
indeed
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
this
room
before
,
"
I
remark
;
"
but
there
use
to
be
no
Porter
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
he
;
"
not
till
it
get
about
that
there
be
no
protection
on
the
premise
,
and
it
come
to
be
consider
dangerous
,
with
convict
and
Tag
and
Rag
and
Bobtail
go
up
and
down
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
be
recommend
to
the
place
as
a
man
who
could
give
another
man
as
good
as
he
bring
,
and
I
take
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
easy
than
bellowse
and
hammering
.
<EOS>
---
that
be
load
,
that
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
eye
have
be
catch
by
a
gun
with
a
brass
bind
stock
over
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
his
eye
have
follow
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
not
desirous
of
more
conversation
,
"
shall
I
go
up
to
Miss
Havisham
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
bum
me
,
if
I
know

<EOS>
he
retort
,
first
stretch
himself
and
then
shake
himself
;
"
my
order
end
here
,
young
master

<EOS>
I
give
this
here
<EOS>
bell
a
rap
with

you
go
on
along

<EOS>
"
burn
me
twice
over

if
I
can
say

say
he
.
  
<EOS>
upon
that
,
I
turn
down
the
long
passage
which
I
have
first
trodden
in
my
thick
boot
,
and
he
make
his
bell
sound
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
passage
,
while
the
bell
be
still
reverberate
,
I
find
Sarah
Pocket
:
who
appear
to
have
now
become
constitutionally
green
and
yellow
by
reason

me

Sarah

with
a
dismal
shake

ah

Matthew
,
Matthew
!
<EOS>
You
know
your
way

sir
?

"
  
<EOS>
tolerably
,
for
I
have
go
up
the
staircase
in
the
dark
,
many
a
time
.
<EOS>
I
ascend
it
now
,
in
light
boot
than
of
yore
,
and
tap
in
my
old
way
at
the
door
of
Miss
Havisham
's
room
.
<EOS>
"
Pip
's
rap

I
hear
her

immediately
;
"
come

<EOS>
She
be
in
her
chair
near
the
old
table
,
in
the
old
dress
,
with
her
two
hand
cross
on
her
stick
,
her
chin
rest
on
them
,
and
her
eye
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
sit
near
her
,
with
the
white
shoe
that
have
never
be
wear
,
in

hand

and
her
head
bent
as
she
look
at

be
an
elegant
lady

I
have
never

<EOS>
"
come
in

Miss
Havisham
continue
to
mutter
,
without

round
or
up
;

how
do
you

my

<EOS>
well

<EOS>
She
look
up
at
me
suddenly

only
move
her
eye
,

repeat
in
a
grimly
playful
manner
,
  
"

at

kind

see
you

I
come
directly

"
  
<EOS>
"
well

"
  
<EOS>
the
lady
whom
I
have
never
see
before
,
lift
up
her
eye
and
look
archly
at
me
,
and
then
I
see
that
the
eye
be
Estella
's
eye
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
so
much
change
,
be
so
much
more
beautiful
,
so
much
more
womanly
,
in
all
thing
win
admiration
have
make
such
wonderful
advance
,
that
I
seem
to
have
make
none
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
,
as
I
look
at
her
,
that
I
slip
hopelessly
back
into
the
coarse
and
common
boy
again
.
<EOS>
o
the
sense
of
distance
and
disparity
that
come
upon
me
,
and
the
inaccessibility
that
come
about
her
!
  
<EOS>
She
give
me
her
hand
.
<EOS>
I
stammer
something
about
the
pleasure
I
feel
in
see
her
again
,
and
about
my
have
look
forward
to
it
for
a
long
,
long
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
find
her
much
change
,
Pip
?
"
ask
Miss
Havisham
,
with
her
greedy
look
,
and
strike
her
stick
upon
a
chair
that
stand
between
them
,
as
a
sign
to
me
to
sit
down
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
come
in

Miss
Havisham

I
think
there
be
nothing

it
all
settle
down
so
curiously
into
the

You

I

confusedly

no

me
.
  
<EOS>
"
less
coarse
and
common
?
"
say
Miss
Havisham
,
play
with
Estella
's
hair
.
  
<EOS>
Estella
laugh
,
and
look
at
the
shoe
in
her
hand
,
and
laugh
again
,
and
look
at
me
,
and
put
the
shoe
down
.
<EOS>
She
treat
me
as
a
boy
still
,
but
she
lure
me
on
.
  
<EOS>
We
sit
in
the
dreamy
room
among
the
old
strange
influence
which
have
so
work
upon
me
,
and
I
learn
that
she
have
but
just
come
home
from
France
,
and
that
she
be
go
to
London
.
<EOS>
proud
and
wilful
as
of
old
,
she
have
bring
those
quality
into
such
subjection
to
her
beauty
that
it
be
impossible
and
out
of
nature
---
or
I
think
so
---
to
separate
them
from
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
truly
it
be
impossible
to
dissociate
her
presence
from
all
those
wretched
hankering
after
money
and
gentility
that
have
disturb
my
boyhood
---
from
all
those
ill
-
regulate
aspiration
that
have
first
make
me
ashamed
of
home
and
Joe
---
from
all
those
vision
that
have
raise
her
face
in
the
glowing
fire
,
strike
it
out
of
the
iron
on
the
anvil
,
extract
it
from
the
darkness
of
night
to
look
in
at
the
wooden
window
of
the
forge
and
flit
away
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
separate
her
,
in
the
past
or
in
the
present
,
from
the
innermost
life
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
settle
that
I
should
stay
there
all
the
rest
of
the
day
,
and
return
to
the
hotel
at
night
,
and
to
London
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
converse
for
a
while
,
Miss
Havisham
send
us
two
out
to
walk
in
the
neglect
garden
:
on
our
come
in
by
-
and
-
by
,
she
say
,
I
should
wheel
her
about
a
little
as
in
time
of
yore
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
Estella
and
I
go
out
into
the
garden
by
the
gate
through
which
I
have
stray
to
my
encounter
with
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
now
Herbert
;
I
,
tremble
in
spirit
and
worship
the
very
hem
of
her
dress
;
she
,
quite
compose
and
most
decidedly
not
worship
the
hem
of
mine
.
<EOS>
as
we
draw
near
to
the
place
of
encounter
,
she
stop
and
say
:
  
"
I
must
have
be
a
singular
little
creature
to
hide
and
see
that
fight
that
day
:
but
I
do
,
and
I
enjoy
it
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
reward
me
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
?
<EOS>
"
she
reply
,
in
an
incidental
and
forgetful
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
I
entertain
a
great
objection
to
your
adversary
,
because
I
take
it
ill
that
he
should
be
bring
here
to
pester
me
with
his
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
and
I
be
great
friend
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
?
<EOS>
I
think
I
recollect
though
,
that
you
read
with
his
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
make
the
admission
with
reluctance
,
for
it
seem
to
have
a
boyish
look
,
and
she
already
treat
me
more
than
enough
like
a
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
since
your
change
of
fortune
and
prospect
,
you
have
change
your
companion
,
"
say
Estella
.
  
<EOS>
"
naturally
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
and
necessarily
,
"
she
add
,
in
a
haughty
tone
;
"
what
be
fit
company
for
you
once
,
would
be
quite
unfit
company
for
you
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
my
conscience
,
I
doubt
very
much
whether
I
have
any
linger
intention
leave
,
of
go
to
see
Joe
;
but
if
I
have
,
this
observation
put
it
to
flight
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
idea
of
your
impending
good
fortune
,
in
those
time
?
"
say
Estella
,
with
a
slight
wave
of
her
hand
,
signify
in
the
fighting
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
the
least
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
air
of
completeness
and
superiority
with
which
she
walk
at
my
side
,
and
the
air
of
youthfulness
and
submission
with
which
I
walk
at
her
,
make
a
contrast
that
I
strongly
feel
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
rankle
in
me
more
than
it
do
,
if
I
have
not
regard
myself
as
elicit
it
by
be
so
set
apart
for
her
and
assign
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
garden
be
too
overgrown
and
rank
for
walk
in
with
ease
,
and
after
we
have
make
the
round
of
it
twice
or
thrice
,
we
come
out
again
into
the
brewery
yard
.
<EOS>
I
show
her
to
a
nicety
where
I
have
see
her
walk
on
the
cask
,
that
first
old
day
,
and
she
say
,
with
a
cold
and
careless
look
in
that
direction
,
"
do
I
?
<EOS>
"
I
remind
her
where
she
have
come
out
of
the
house
and
give
me
my
meat
and
drink
,
and
she
say
,
"
I
do
not
remember
.
"
<EOS>
"
not
remember
that
you
make
me
cry
?
"
say
I.
"
no
,
"
say
she
,
and
shake
her
head
and
look
about
her
.
<EOS>
I
verily
believe
that
her
not
remember
and
not
mind
in
the
least
,
make
me
cry
again
,
inwardly
---
and
that
be
the
sharp
crying
of
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
,
"
say
Estella
,
condescend
to
me
as
a
brilliant
and
beautiful
woman
may
,
"
that
I
have
no
heart
---
if
that
have
anything
to
do
with
my
memory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
get
through
some
jargon
to
the
effect
that
I
take
the
liberty
of
doubt
that
.
<EOS>
that
I
know
better
.
<EOS>
that
there
could
be
no
such
beauty
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
heart
to
be
stab
in
or
shoot
in
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
say
Estella
,
"
and
,
of
course
,
if
it
cease
to
beat
I
should
cease
to
be
.
<EOS>
but
you
know
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
softness
there
,
no
---
sympathy
---
sentiment
---
nonsense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
 
\
be
\
 
<EOS>
it
that
be
bear
in
upon
my
mind
when
she
stand
still
and
look
attentively
at
me
?
<EOS>
anything
that
I
have
see
in
Miss
Havisham
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
in
some
of
her
look
and
gesture
there
be
that
tinge
of
resemblance
to
Miss
Havisham
which
may
often
be
notice
to
have
be
acquire
by
child
,
from
grown
person
with
whom
they
have
be
much
associate
and
seclude
,
and
which
,
when
childhood
be
pass
,
will
produce
a
remarkable
occasional
likeness
of
expression
between
face
that
be
otherwise
quite
different
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
could
not
trace
this
to
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
I
look
again
,
and
though
she
be
still
look
at
me
,
the
suggestion
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
what
 
\
be
\
 
<EOS>
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
serious
,
"
say
Estella
,
not
so
much
with
a
frown
<EOS>
(
for
her
brow
be
smooth
)
as
with
a
darkening
of
her
face
;
"
if
we
be
to
be
throw
much
together
,
you
have
better
believe
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
no
!
"
<EOS>
imperiously
stop
me
as
I
open
my
lip
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
bestow
my
tenderness
anywhere
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
have
any
such
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
another
moment
we
be
in
the
brewery
so
long
disused
,
and
she
point
to
the
high
gallery
where
I
have
see
her
go
out
on
that
same
first
day
,
and
tell
me
she
remember
to
have
be
up
there
,
and
to
have
see
me
stand
scared
below
.
<EOS>
as
my
eye
follow
her
white
hand
,
again
the
same
dim
suggestion
that
I
could
not
possibly
grasp
,
cross
me
.
<EOS>
My
involuntary
start
occasion
her
to
lay
her
hand
upon
my
arm
.
<EOS>
instantly
the
ghost
pass
once
more
,
and
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
what
 
\
be
\
 
<EOS>
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
ask
Estella
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
scare
again
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
,
if
I
believe
what
you
say
just
now
,
"
I
reply
,
to
turn
it
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
do
not
?
<EOS>
very
well
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
will
soon
be
expect
you
at
your
old
post
,
though
I
think
that
may
be
lay
aside
now
,
with
other
old
belonging
.
<EOS>
let
us
make
one
more
round
of
the
garden
,
and
then
go
in
.
<EOS>
come
!
<EOS>
You
shall
not
shed
tear
for
my
cruelty
to
-
day
;
you
shall
be
my
page
,
and
give
me
your
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
handsome
dress
have
trail
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
She
hold
it
in
one
hand
now
,
and
with
the
other
lightly
touch
my
shoulder
as
we
walk
.
<EOS>
We
walk
round
the
ruin
garden
twice
or
thrice
more
,
and
it
be
all
in
bloom
for
me
.
<EOS>
if
the
green
and
yellow
growth
of
weed
in
the
chink
of
the
old
wall
have
be
the
most
precious
flower
that
ever
blow
,
it
could
not
have
be
more
cherish
in
my
remembrance
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
discrepancy
of
year
between
us
,
to
remove
her
far
from
me
;
we
be
of
nearly
the
same
age
,
though
of
course
the
age
tell
for
more
in
her
case
than
in
mine
;
but
the
air
of
inaccessibility
which
her
beauty
and
her
manner
give
her
,
torment
me
in
the
midst
of
my
delight
,
and
at
the
height
of
the
assurance
I
feel
that
our
patroness
have
choose
us
for
one
another
.
<EOS>
wretched
boy
!
  
<EOS>
at
last
we
go
back
into
the
house
,
and
there
I
hear
,
with
surprise
,
that
my
guardian
have
come
down
to
see
Miss
Havisham
on
business
,
and
would
come
back
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
the
old
wintry
branch
of
chandelier
in
the
room
where
the
mouldering
table
be
spread
,
have
be
light
while
we
be
out
,
and
Miss
Havisham
be
in
her
chair
and
wait
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
like
push
the
chair
itself
back
into
the
past
,
when
we
begin
the
old
slow
circuit
round
about
the
ashe
of
the
bridal
feast
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
funereal
room
,
with
that
figure
of
the
grave
fall
back
in
the
chair
fix
its
eye
upon
her
<EOS>
,
Estella
look
more
bright
and
beautiful
than
before
,
and
I
be
under
strong
enchantment
.
  
<EOS>
the
time
so
melt
away
,
that
our
early
dinner
-
hour
draw
close
at
hand
,
and
Estella
leave
us
to
prepare
herself
.
<EOS>
We
have
stop
near
the
centre
of
the
long
table
,
and
Miss
Havisham
,
with
one
of
her
wither
arm
stretch
out
of
the
chair
,
rest
that
clenched
hand
upon
the
yellow
cloth
.
<EOS>
as
Estella
look
back
over
her
shoulder
before
go
out
at
the
door
,
Miss
Havisham
kiss
that
hand
to
her
,
with
a
ravenous
intensity
that
be
of
its
kind
quite
dreadful
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
Estella
be
go
and
we
two
leave
alone
<EOS>
,
she
turn
to
me
,
and
say
in
a
whisper
:
  
"
be
she
beautiful
,
graceful
,
well
-
grow
?
<EOS>
do
you
admire
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
everybody
must
who
see
her
,
Miss
Havisham
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
draw
an
arm
<EOS>
round
my
neck
,
and
draw
my
head
close
down
to
hers
as
she
sit
in
the
chair
.
<EOS>
"
love
her
,
love
her
,
love
her
!
<EOS>
how
do
she
use
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
before
I
could
answer
(
if
I
could
have
answer
so
difficult
a
question
at
all
)
,
she
repeat
,
"
love
her
,
love
her
,
love
her
!
<EOS>
if
she
favour
you
,
love
her
.
<EOS>
if
she
wound
you
,
love
her
.
<EOS>
if
she
tear
your
heart
to
piece
---
and
as
it
get
old
and
strong
,
it
will
tear
deeper
---
love
her
,
love
her
,
love
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
never
have
I
see
such
passionate
eagerness
as
be
join
to
her
utterance
of
these
word
.
<EOS>
I
could
feel
the
muscle
of
the
thin
arm
round
my
neck
,
swell
with
the
vehemence
that
possess
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
hear
me
,
Pip
!
<EOS>
I
adopt
her
to
be
love
.
<EOS>
I
breed
her
and
educate
her
,
to
be
love
.
<EOS>
I
develop
her
into
what
she
be
,
that
she
may
be
love
.
<EOS>
love
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
say
the
word
often
enough
,
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
she
mean
to
say
it
;
but
if
the
often
repeat
word
have
be
hate
instead
of
love
---
despair
---
revenge
---
dire
death
---
it
could
not
have
sound
from
her
lip
more
like
a
curse
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
"
say
she
,
in
the
same
hurried
passionate
whisper
,
"
what
real
love
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
blind
devotion
,
unquestione
self
-
humiliation
,
utter
submission
,
trust
and
belief
against
yourself
and
against
the
whole
world
,
give
up
your
whole
heart
and
soul
to
the
smiter
---
as
I
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
when
she
come
to
that
,
and
to
a
wild
cry
that
follow
that
,
I
catch
her
round
the
waist
.
<EOS>
for
she
rise
up
in
the
chair
,
in
her
shroud
of
a
dress
,
and
strike
at
the
air
as
if
she
would
as
soon
have
strike
herself
against
the
wall
and
fall
dead
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
pass
in
a
few
second
.
<EOS>
as
I
draw
her
down
into
her
chair
,
I
be
conscious
of
a
scent
that
I
know
,
and
turn
,
see
my
guardian
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
He
always
carry
<EOS>
(
I
have
not
yet
mention
it
,
I
think
)
<EOS>
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
of
rich
silk
and
of
impose
proportion
,
which
be
of
great
value
to
him
in
his
profession
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
him
so
terrify
a
client
or
a
witness
by
ceremoniously
unfold
this
pocket
-
handkerchief
as
if
he
be
immediately
go
to
blow
his
nose
,
and
then
pause
,
<EOS>
as
if
he
know
he
should
not
have
time
to
do
it
before
such
client
or
witness
commit
himself
,
that
the
self
-

<EOS>
when
I
see
him
in
the
room
,
he
have
this
expressive
pocket
-
handkerchief
in
both
hand
,
and
be
look
at
us

<EOS>
on
meet
my
eye

he
say
plainly
,
by
a
momentary
and
silent
pause
in
that
attitude
,
"

<EOS>
singular
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
put
the
handkerchief
to
its
right
use
with
wonderful
effect
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
have
see
him
as
soon
as
I
,
and
be
(
like
everybody
else
)
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
make
a
strong
attempt
to
compose
herself
,
and
stammer
that
he
be
as
punctual
as
ever

"

"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
when
I
have
arrive
,
and
how
Miss
Havisham
have
wish
me
to
come
and

Estella

<EOS>
to
which
he
reply
,
"
ah

<EOS>
very
fine
young
lady

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
he
push
Miss
Havisham
in
her
chair
before
him
,
with
one
of
his
large
hand
,
and
put
the
other
in
his

pocket
as
if
the

full
of
secret

"
  
<EOS>
He
comply
,
and
we
grope
our
way
down
the
dark
stair
together
.
<EOS>
while
we
be
still
on
our
way
to
those
detach
apartment
across
the
paved
yard
at
the
back
,
he
ask
me
how
often
I
have
see
Miss
Havisham
eat
and
drink
;
offer
me
a
breadth
of
choice
,
as

between
a
hundred

<EOS>
I
consider
,
and
say
,
"
never

"
<EOS>
and
never
will

Pip

he
retort

"
She

never

She
wander
about
in
the
night

then
lay
hand
on
such
food
as
she
take

<EOS>
"
  
"
Pray

<EOS>

Estella

It

"
  
<EOS>
this
bring
us
to
the
dinner
-
table
,
where
she
and
Sarah
Pocket
await
us
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
preside
,
Estella
sit
opposite
to
him
,
I
face
my
green
and
yellow
friend
.
<EOS>
We
dine
very
well
,
and
be
wait
on
by
a
maid
-
servant
whom
I
have
never
see
in
all
my
coming
and
going
,
but
who
,
for
anything
I
know
,
have
be
in
that
mysterious
house
the
whole
time
.
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
a
bottle
of
choice
old
port
be
place
before
my
guardian
(
he
be
evidently
well
acquaint
with
the
vintage
)
,
and
the
two
lady
leave
us
.
  
<EOS>
anything
to
equal
the
determined
reticence
of
Mr
Jaggers
under
that
roof
<EOS>
,
I
never
see
elsewhere
,
even
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
keep
his
very
look
to
himself
,
and
scarcely
direct
his
eye
to
Estella
's
face
once
during
dinner
.
<EOS>
when
she
speak
to
him
,
he
listen
,
and
in
due
course
answer
,
but
never
look
at
her
,
that
I
could
see
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
she
often
look
at
him
,
with
interest
and
curiosity
,
if
not
distrust
,
but
his
face
never
show
the
least
consciousness
.
<EOS>
throughout
dinner
he
take
a
dry
delight
in
make
Sarah
Pocket
greener
and
yellower
,
by
often
refer
in
conversation
with
me
to
my
expectation
;
but
here
,
again
,
he
show
no
consciousness
,
and
even
make
it
appear
that
he
extort
---
and
even
do
extort
,
though
I
do
not
know
<EOS>
how
---
those
reference
out
of
my
innocent
self
.
  
<EOS>
and
when
he
and
I
be
leave
alone
together
,
he
sit
with
an
air
upon
him
of
general
lying
by
in
consequence
of
information
<EOS>
he
possess
,
that
really
be
too
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
cros
-
examine
his
very
wine
when
he
have
nothing
else
in
hand
.
<EOS>
He
hold
it
between
himself
and
the
candle
,
taste
the
port
,
roll
it
in
his
mouth
,
swallow
it
,
look
at
his
glass
again
,
smell
the
port
,
try
it
,
drank
it
,
fill
again
,
and
cross
-
examine
the
glass
again
,
until
I
be
as
nervous
as
if
I
have
know
the
wine
to
be
tell
him
something
to
my
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
three
or
four
time
I
feebly
think
I
would
start
conversation
;
but
whenever
he
see
me
go
to
ask
him
anything
,
he
look
at
me
with
his
glass
in
his
hand
,
and
roll
his
wine
about
in
his
mouth
,
as
if
request
me
to
take
notice
that
it
be
of
no
use
,
for
he
could
not
answer
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
Miss
Pocket
be
conscious
that
the
sight
of
me
involve
her
in
the
danger
of
be
goad
to
madness
,
and
perhaps
tear
off
her
cap
---
which
be
a
very
hideous
one
,
in
the
nature
of
a
muslin
mop
---
and
strew
the
ground
with
her
hair
---
which
assuredly
have
never
grow
on
 
\
<EOS>
her
\
 
head
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
appear
when
we
afterwards
go
up
to
Miss
Havisham
's
room
,
and
we
four
play
at
whist
.
<EOS>
in
the
interval
,
Miss
Havisham
,
in
a
fantastic
way
,
have
put
some
of
the
most
beautiful
jewel
from
her
dressing
-
table
into
Estella
's
hair
,
and
about
her
bosom
and
arm
;
and
I
see
even
my
guardian
look
at
her
from
under
his
thick
eyebrow
,
and
raise
them
a
little
,
when
her
loveliness
be
before
him
,
with
those
rich
flush
of
glitter
and
colour
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
of
the
manner
and
extent
to
which
he
take
our
trump
into
custody
,
and
come
out
with
mean
little
card
at
the
end
of
hand
,
before
which
the
glory
of
our
Kings
and
Queens
be
utterly
abase
,
I
say
nothing
;
nor
,
of
the
feeling
that
I
have
,
respect
his
look
upon
us
personally
in
the
light
of
three
very
obvious
and
poor
riddle
that
he
have
find
out
long
ago
.
<EOS>
what
I
suffer
from
,
be
the
incompatibility
between
his
cold
presence
and
my
feeling
towards
Estella
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
I
know
I
could
never
bear
to
speak
to
him
about
her
,
that
I
know
I
could
never
bear
to
hear
him
creak
his
boot
at
her
,
that
I
know
I
could
never
bear
to
see
him
wash
his
hand
of
her
;
it
be
,
that
my
admiration
should
be
within
a
foot
or
two
of
him---
<EOS>
it
be
,
that
my
feeling
should
be
in
the
same
place
with
him
---
 
\
<EOS>
that
,
\
 
be
the
agonizing
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
We
play
until
nine
o'clock
,
and
then
it
be
arrange
that
when
Estella
come
to
London
I
should
be
forewarn
of
her
come
and
should
meet
her
at
the
coach
;
and
then
I
take
leave
of
her
,
and
touch
her
and
leave
her
.
  
<EOS>
My
guardian
lie
at
the
Boar
in
the
next
room
to
mine
.
<EOS>
far
into
the
night
,
Miss
Havisham
's
word
,
"
love
her
,
love
her
,
love
her
!
"
<EOS>
sound
in
my
ear
.
<EOS>
I
adapt
them
for
my
own
repetition
,
and
say
to
my
pillow
,
"
I
love
her
,
I
love
her
,
I
love
her
!
"
<EOS>
hundred
of
time
.
<EOS>
then
,
a
burst
of
gratitude
come
upon
me
,
that
she
should
be
destine
for
me
,
once
the
blacksmith
's
boy
.
<EOS>
then
,
I
think
if
she
be
,
as
I
fear
,
by
no
means
rapturously
grateful
for
that
destiny
yet
,
when
would
she
begin
to
be
interested
in
me
?
<EOS>
when
should
I
awaken
the
heart
within
her
,
that
be
mute
and
sleep
now
?
  
<EOS>
ah
me
!
<EOS>
I
think
those
be
high
and
great
emotion
.
<EOS>
but
I
never
think
there
be
anything
low
and
small
in
my
keeping
away
from
Joe
,
because
I
know
she
would
be
contemptuous
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
day
go
,
and
Joe
have
bring
the
tear
into
my
eye
<EOS>
;
they
have
soon
dry
,
God
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
soon
dry
.
    
<EOS>
chapter
30
 
after
<EOS>
well
consider
the
matter
while
I
be
dress
at
the
Blue
Boar
in
the
morning
,
I
resolve
to
tell
my
guardian
that
I
doubt
Orlick
's
be
the
right
sort
of
man
to
fill
a
post
of
trust
at
Miss
Havisham
's
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
of
course
he
be
not
the
right
sort
of
man
,
Pip
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
comfortably
satisfied
beforehand
on
the
general
head
,
"
because
the
man
who
fill
the
post
of
trust
never
be
the
right
sort
of
man
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
quite
to
put
him
into
spirit
,
to
find
that
this
particular
post
be
not
exceptionally
hold
by
the
right
sort
of
man
,
and
he
listen
in
a
satisfied
manner
while
I
tell
him
what
knowledge
I
have
of
Orlick
.
"
<EOS>
very
good
,
Pip
<EOS>
,
"
he
observe
,
when
I
have
conclude
,
"
I
will
go
round
presently
,
and
pay
our
friend
off
.
"
<EOS>
rather
alarm
by
this
summary
action
,
I
be
for
a
little
delay
,
and
even
hint
that
our
friend
himself
may
be
difficult
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
"
oh
no
he
will
not
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
make
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
-
point
,
with
perfect
confidence
;
"
I
should
like
to
see
him
argue
the
question
with
 
\
me
.
"
<EOS>
\
   
<EOS>
as
we
be
go
back
together
to
London
by
the
mid
-
day
coach
,
and
as
I
breakfast
under
such
terror
of
Pumblechook
that
I
could
scarcely
hold
my
cup
,
this
give
me
an
opportunity
of
say
that
I
want
a
walk
,
and
that
I
would
go
on
along
the
London
-
road
while
Mr
Jaggers
be
occupy
,
if
he
would
let
the
coachman
know
that
I
would
get
into
my
place
when
overtaken
.
<EOS>
I
be
thus
enable
to
fly
from
the
Blue
Boar
immediately
after
breakfast
.
<EOS>
by
then
make
a
loop
of
about
a
couple
of
mile
into
the
open
country
at
the
back
of
Pumblechook
's
premise
,
I
get
round
into
the
high
-
street
again
,
a
little
beyond
that
pitfall
,
and
feel
myself
in
comparative
security
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
interesting
to
be
in
the
quiet
old
town
once
more
,
and
it
be
not
disagreeable
to
be
here
<EOS>
and
there
suddenly
recognize
and
stare
after
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
of
the
tradespeople
even
dart
out
of
their
shop
and
go
a
little
way
down
the
street
before
me
,
that
they
may
turn
,
as
if
they
have
forget
something
,
and
pass
me
face
to
face
---
on
which
occasion
I
do
not
know
whether
they
or
I
make
the
bad
pretence
;
they
of
not
do
it
,
or
I
of
not
see
it
.
<EOS>
still
my
position
be
a
distinguished
one
,
and
I
be
not
at
all
dissatisfy
with
it
,
until
Fate
throw
me
in
the
way
of
that
unlimited
miscreant
,
Trabb
's
boy
.
  
<EOS>
cast
my
eye
along
the
street
at
a
certain
point
of
my
progress
,
I
beheld
Trabb
's
boy
approach
,
lash
himself
with
an
empty
blue
bag
.
<EOS>
deem
that
a
serene
and
unconscious
contemplation
of
him
would
best
beseem
me
,
and
would
be
most
likely
to
quell
his
evil
mind
,
I
advance
with
that
expression
of
countenance
,
and
be
rather
congratulate
myself
on
my
success
,
when
suddenly
the
knee
of
Trabb
's
boy
smite
together
,
his
hair
uprose
,
his
cap
fall
off
,
he
tremble
violently
in
every
limb
,
stagger
out
into
the
road
,
and
cry
to
the
populace
,
"
<EOS>
hold
mel
<EOS>
I
be
so
frightened
!
"
<EOS>
feign
to
be
in
a
paroxysm
of
terror
and
contrition
,
occasion
by
the
dignity
of
my
appearance
.
<EOS>
as
I
pass
him
,
his
tooth
loudly
chatter
in
his
head
,
and
with
every
mark
of
extreme
humiliation
,
he
prostrate
himself
in
the
dust
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
hard
thing
to
bear
,
but
this
be
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
advance
another
two
hundred
yard
,
when
,
to
my
inexpressible
terror
,
amazement
,
and
indignation
,
I
again
behold
Trabb
's
boy
approach
.
<EOS>
He
be
come
round
a
narrow
corner
.
<EOS>
His
blue
bag
be
sling
over
his
shoulder
,
honest
industry
beam
in
his
eye
,
a
determination
to
proceed
to
Trabb
's
with
<EOS>
cheerful
briskness
be
indicate
in
his
gait
.
<EOS>
with
a
shock
he
become
aware
of
me
,
and
be
severely
visit
as
before
;
but
this
time
his
motion
be
rotatory
,
and
he
stagger
round
and
round
me
with
knee
more
afflict
,
and
with
uplifted
hand
as
if
beseech
for
mercy
.
<EOS>
His
suffering
be
hail
with
the
great
joy
by
a
knot
of
spectator
,
and
I
feel
utterly
confound
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
get
as
much
further
down
the
street
as
the
post
-
office
,
when
I
again
behold
Trabb
's
boy
shoot
round
by
a
back
way
.
<EOS>
this
time
,
he
be
entirely
change
.
<EOS>
He
wear
the
blue
bag

throw
in

sympathetic
of

---
then
,
my

I
can
not

dependent

uncertain
I
feel
,

how
expose
to
hundred
of
chance
.
<EOS>
avoid
forbid
ground
,
as
you
do
just
now
,
I
may
still
say
that
on
the
constancy
of
one
person
(
name
no
person
)
all
my
expectation
depend
.
<EOS>
and
at
the
good
,
how
indefinite
and
unsatisfactory
,
only
to
know
so
vaguely
what
they
be
!
"
<EOS>
in
say
this
,
I
relieve
my
mind
of
what
have
always
be
there
,
more
or
less
,
though
no
doubt
most
since
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Handel
,
"
Herbert
reply
,
in
his
gay
hopeful
way
,
"
it
seem
to
me
that
in
the
despondency
of
the
tender
passion
,
we
be
look
into
our
gift

horse
's
mouth
with
a
magnifying
-
glass
.
<EOS>
likewise
,
it
seem
to
me
that
,
concentrate
our
attention
on
the
examination
,
we
altogether
overlook
one
of
the
good
point
of
the
animal
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
tell
me
that
your
guardian
,
Mr
Jaggers
,
tell
you
in
the
beginning
,
that
you
be
not
endow
with
expectation
only
?

even
if
he
have
not
tell
you
so
---
though
that
be
a
very
large
<EOS>
if
,
I
grant
---
could
you
believe
that
of

Mr

be
the
man

hold
his

relation
towards
you

be
sure
of
his
ground

"
  
<EOS>
I
say
I
could
not
deny
that
this
be
a
strong
point

<EOS>
I
say
it
<EOS>
(
people
often
do
so
,
in
such
case
)
like
a
rather
reluctant
concession
to
truth
and
justice
;

as
if
I
want
to
deny
it
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
should

it

be
\
 
<EOS>
a
strong
point
,

Herbert

<EOS>
and
I
should
think
you
would
be
puzzle
to
imagine
a
strong
;
as
to
the
rest
,
you
must
bide
your
guardian

time

he
must
bide
his
client
's
time

<EOS>
You
will
be
one

twenty
before
you
know
where
you
be

then
perhaps
you
will
get
some
further
enlightenment

at

you
will
be

get
it

come
at

"
I
ought
to
have

"

Herbert

for
I

not

<EOS>
I
must
acknowledge
,
by

the

that
the
good

I

the

I

repay

with
confidence

turn

with
a
rush

a
sweep

up

on

so
strongly
rooted
in

breast

nature

make
so
romantic

render
it
very
serious

<EOS>
think
of
her
bringing

up

<EOS>
I
suppose
there
be
a
time
once

if
ever
there
be

the

be
go

<EOS>
May
I
ask
you
if
you
have
ever
have
an
opportunity
of
remark
,
down
in
your
part
of
the

,
that
the

of
not
exactly
suitable
marriage
,
be
always
most
particularly
anxious
to
be
marry
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
such
a
singular
question
,
that
I
ask
him
in
return
:
"
be
it
so

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know

say
Herbert

"
that
be
what
I
want
to
know

<EOS>
because
it
be
decidedly
the

<EOS>
My

be
next
me

die
before
she

Little

<EOS>
in

you

pass
her
short

perpetual
contemplation

domestic

I.

Herbert

it

<EOS>
I
assure
him
of
my

beg
to

further
particular

<EOS>
He
have
speak
so
sensibly

feelingly
of
my

I

something

Herbert

who
have
become
curiously
crestfallen
and
meek
,
since
we
enter
on
the
interesting
theme
,
"
that
she
be
rather
below
my

nonsensical

Her

<EOS>
which
be
not

at
all
what
I

for
I
have
intend
my

to
apply
to
his

<EOS>
"
I

never

for
he

always
keep
his

overhead

but
I
have
hear
him
constantly

He
make
tremendous
row

roar

peg
at

floor
with
some
frightful
instrument

<EOS>
in
look
at
me
and
then
laugh
heartily
,
Herbert
for
the
time
recover
his
usual
lively
manner

<EOS>
"
do
not
you
expect

I.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes

I

Herbert

I

when

once
more

heartily

he
become
meek
again

tell
me
that
the

it

He
add
as

low

<EOS>
as
we
contemplate
the
fire
,
and
as
I
think
what
a
difficult
vision
to
realize
this

capital
sometimes
be
,
I
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket

<EOS>
a
folded
piece
of
paper
in

of

attract
my
attention

I
open
it

find
it
to

playbill
I
have
receive
from
Joe

relative

the
celebrated
provincial
amateur
of
roscian
renown

I
involuntarily

aloud
,
<EOS>
"
it

<EOS>
this
change
the
subject
in
an
instant
,
and
make
us
hurriedly
resolve
to
go
to
the
play
.
<EOS>
so
,
when
I
have
pledge
myself
to
comfort
and
abet
Herbert
in
the
affair
of
his
heart
by
all
practicable
and
impracticable
mean

and
when
Herbert
have
tell
me
that
his
affiance
already
know
me
by
reputation
and
that
I
should
be
present
to
her

and
when
we
have
warmly
shake
hand
upon
our
mutual
confidence
,
we
blow
out
our
candle
,
make
up
our

lock

forth
in
quest
of
Mr

<EOS>
chapter
31
 
on
our
arrival
in
Denmark
,
we
find
the
king
and
queen
of
that
country
elevate
in
two
arm
-
chair
on
a
kitchen
-
table
,
hold
a
Court
.
<EOS>
the
whole
of
the
danish
nobility
be
in
attendance
;
consist
of
a
noble
boy
in
the
wash
-
leather
boot
of
a
gigantic
ancestor
,
a
venerable
peer
with
a
dirty
face
who
seem
to
have
rise
from
the
people
late
in
life
,
and
the
danish
chivalry
with
a
comb
in
its
hair
and
a
pair
of
white
silk
leg
,
and
present
on
the
whole
a
feminine
appearance
.
<EOS>
My
gifted
townsman
stand
gloomily
apart
,
with
fold
arm
,
and
I
could
have
wish
that
his
curl
and
forehead
have
be
more
probable
.
  
<EOS>
several
curious
little
circumstance
transpire
as
the
action
proceed
.
<EOS>
the
late
king
of
the
country
not
only
appear
to
have
be
trouble
with
a
cough
at
the
time
of
his
decease
,
but
to
have
take
it
with
him
to
the
tomb
,
and
to
have
bring
it
back
.
<EOS>
the
royal
phantom
also
carry
a
ghostly
manuscript
round
its
truncheon
,
to
which
it
have
the
appearance
of
occasionally
refer
and
that
,
too
,
with
an
air
of
anxiety
and
a
tendency
to
lose
the
place
of
reference
which
be
suggestive
of
a
state
of
mortality
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
,
I
conceive
,
which
lead
to
the
Shade
's
be
advise
by
the
gallery
to
"
turn
over
!
"
---
a
recommendation
which
it
take
extremely
ill
.
<EOS>
It
be
likewise
to
be
note
of
this
majestic
spirit
that
whereas
it
always
appear
with
an
air
of
have
be
out
a
long
time
and
walk
an
immense
distance
,
it
perceptibly
come
from
a
closely
contiguous
wall
.
<EOS>
this
occasion
its
tenor
to
be
receive
derisively
.
<EOS>
the
Queen
of
Denmark
,
a
very
buxom
lady
,
though
no
doubt
historically
brazen
,
be
consider
by
the
public
to
have
too
much
brass
about
her
;
her
chin
be
attach
to
her
diadem
by
a
broad
band
of
that
metal
(
as
if
she
have
a
gorgeous
toothache
)
,
her
waist
be
encircle
by
another
,
and
each
of
her
arm
by
another
,
so
that
she
be
openly
mention
as
"
the
kettledrum
.
<EOS>
"
the
noble
boy
in
the
ancestral
boot
,
be
inconsistent
;
represent
himself
,
as
it
be
in
one
breath
,
as
an
able
seaman
,
a
strolling
actor
,
a
gravedigger
,
a
clergyman
,
and
a
person
of
the
utmost
importance
at
a
Court
fencing
-
match
,
on
the
authority
of
whose
practised
eye
and
nice
discrimination
<EOS>
the
fine
stroke
be
judge
.
<EOS>
this
gradually
lead
to
a
want
of
toleration
for
him
,
and
even
---
on
his
be
detect
in
holy
order
,
and
decline
to
perform
the
funeral
service
---
to
the
general
indignation
take
the
form
of
nut
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
Ophelia
be
a
prey
to
such
slow
musical
madness
,
that
when
,
in
course
of
time
,
she
have
take
off
her
white
muslin
scarf
,
fold
it
up
,
and
bury
it
,
a
sulky
man
who
have
be
long
cool
his
impatient
nose
against
an
iron
bar
in
the
front
row
of
the
gallery
,
growl
,
"
now
the
baby
's
put
to
bed
let
's
have
supper
!
"
<EOS>
which
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
,
be
out
of
keep
.
  
<EOS>
upon
my
unfortunate
townsman
all
these
incident
accumulate
with
playful
effect
.
<EOS>
whenever
that
undecide
Prince
have
to
ask
a
question
or
state
a
doubt
,
the
public
help
him
out
with
it
.
<EOS>
as
for
example
;
on
the
question
whether
'
twas
nobler
in
the
mind
to
suffer
some
roar
yes
,
and
some
no
,
and
some
incline
to
both
opinion
say
"
toss
up
for
it
;
"
and
quite
a
Debating
Society
arise
.
<EOS>
when
he
ask
what
should
such
fellow
as
he
do
crawl
between
earth
and
heaven
,
he
be
encourage
with
loud
cry
of
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
<EOS>
when
he
appear
with
his
stocking
disorder
(
its
disorder
express
,
accord
to
usage
,
by
one
very
neat
fold
in
the
top
,
which
I
suppose
to
be
always
get
up
with
a
flat
iron
)
,
a
conversation
take
place
in
the
gallery
respect
the
paleness
of
his
leg
,
and
whether
it
be
occasion
by
the
turn
the
ghost
have
give
him
.
<EOS>
on
his
take
the
recorder
---
very
like
a
little
black
flute
that
have
just
be
play
in
the
orchestra
and
hand
out
at
the
door
---
he
be
call
upon
unanimously
for
Rule
Britannia
.
<EOS>
when
he
recommend
the
player
not
to
saw
the
air
thus
,
the
sulky
man
say
,
"
<EOS>
and
do
not
you
do
it
,
neither
;
you
be
a
deal
bad
than
 
<EOS>
\
him
!
"
<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
and
I
grieve
to
add
that
peal
of
laughter
greet
Mr
Wopsle
on
every
one
of
these
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
but
his
great
trial
be
in
the
churchyard
:
which
have
the
appearance
of
a
primeval
forest
,
with
a
kind
of
small
ecclesiastical
wash
-
house
on
one
side
,
and
a
turnpike
gate
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
in
a
comprehensive
black
cloak
,
be
descry
entering
at
the
turnpike
,
the
gravedigger
be
admonish
in
a
friendly
way
,
"
look
out
!
<EOS>
here
be
the
undertaker
a
coming
,
to
see
how
you
be
a
get
on
with
your
work
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
well
know
in
a
constitutional
country
that
Mr
Wopsle
could
not
possibly
have
return
the
skull
,
after
moralize
over
it
,
without
dust
his
finger
on
a
white
napkin
take
from
his
breast
;
but
even
that
innocent
and
indispensable
action
do
not
pass
without
the
comment
"
Wai
-
ter
!
"
<EOS>
the
arrival
of
the
body
for
interment
(
in
an
empty
black
box
with
the
lid
tumble
open
)
,
be
the
signal
for
a
general
joy
which
be
much
enhance
by
the
discovery
,
among
the
bearer
,
of
an
individual
obnoxious
to
identification
.
<EOS>
the
joy
attend
Mr
Wopsle
through
his
struggle
with
Laertes
on
the
brink
of
the
orchestra
and
the
grave
,
and
slacken
no
more
until
he
have
tumble
the
king
off
the
kitchen
-
table
,
and
have
die
by
inch
from
the
ankle
upward
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
make
some
pale
effort
in
the
beginning
to
applaud
Mr
Wopsle
;
but
they
be
too
hopeless
to
be
persist
in
.
<EOS>
therefore
we
have
sit
,
feel
keenly
for
him
,
but
laughing
,
nevertheless
,
from
ear
to
ear
.
<EOS>
I
laugh
in
spite
of
myself
all
the
time
,
the
whole
thing
be
so
droll
;
and
yet
I
have
a
latent
impression
that
there
be
something
decidedly
fine
in
Mr
Wopsle
's
elocution
---
not
for
old
association
'
sake
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
,
but
because
it
be
very
slow
,
very
dreary
,
very
up
-
hill
and
down
-
hill
,
and
very
unlike
any
way
in
which
any
man
in
any
natural
circumstance
of
life
or
death
ever
express
himself
about
anything
.
<EOS>
when
the
tragedy
be
over
,
and
he
have
be
call
for
and
hoot
,
I
say
to
Herbert
,
"
let
us
go
at
once
,
or
perhaps
we
shall
meet
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
make
all
the
haste
we
could
down
-
stair
,
but
we
be
not
quick
enough
either
.
<EOS>
stand
at
the
door
be
a
jewish
man
with
an
unnatural
heavy
smear
of
eyebrow
,
who
catch
my
eye
as
we
advance
,
and
say
,
when
we
come
up
with
him
:
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pip
and
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
identity
of
Mr
Pip
and
friend
confess

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Waldengarver

say
the
man
,
"
would
be
glad
to
have
the
honour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
waldengarver

<EOS>
"
I
repeat
---
when
Herbert
murmur
in
my
ear
,
probably
Wopsle
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
"
say
I.
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
follow
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
few
step
,
please
.
<EOS>
"
when
we
be
in
a
side
alley
,
he
turn
and
ask
,
"
how
do
you
think
he
look
?
<EOS>
---
I
dress
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
he
have
look
like
,
except
a
funeral
;
with
the
addition
of
a
large
danish
sun
or
star
hang
round
his
neck
by
a
blue
ribbon
,
that
have
give
him
the
appearance
of
be
insure
in
some
extraordinary
Fire
Office
.
<EOS>
but
I
say
he
have
look
very
nice
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
he
come
to
the
grave
,
"
say
our
conductor
,
"
he
show
his
cloak
beautiful
.
<EOS>
but
,
judge
from
the
wing
,
it
look
to
me
that
when
he
see
the
ghost
in
the
queen
's
apartment
,
he
may
have
make
more
of
his
stocking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
modestly
assent
,
and
we
all
fall
through
a
little
dirty
swing
door
,
into
a
sort
of
hot
packing
-
case
immediately
behind
it
.
<EOS>
here
Mr
Wopsle
be
divest
himself
of
his
danish
garment
,
and
here
there
be
just
room
for
us
to
look
at
him
over
one
another
's
shoulder
,
by

the
packing

or

,
wide
open

"

Mr

"
I
be
proud
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Mr
Pip
,
you
will
excuse
my
sending
round
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
happiness
to
know
you
in
former
time
,
and
the
Drama
have
ever
have
a
claim
which
have
ever
be
acknowledge
,
on
the
noble
and
the
affluent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Mr
Waldengarver
,
in
a
frightful
perspiration
,
be
try
to
get
himself
out
of
his
princely
sable
.
  
<EOS>
"
skin
the
stocking
off
,
<EOS>
Mr
Waldengarver
,
"
say
the
owner
of
that
property
,
"
or
you
will
bust
'em
.
<EOS>
Bust
'em
,
and
you
will
bust
five
-
and
-
thirty
shilling
.
<EOS>
Shakespeare
never
be
compliment
with
a
fine
pair
.
<EOS>
keep
quiet
in
your
chair
now
,
and
leave
'em
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
,
he
go
upon
his
knee
,
and
begin
to
flay
his
victim
;
who
,
on
the
first
stocking
come
off
,
would
certainly
have
fall
over
backward
with
his
chair
,
but
for
there
be
no
room
to
fall
anyhow
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
afraid
until
then
to
say
a
word
about
the
play
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
Mr
Waldengarver
look
up
at
us
complacently
,
and
say
:
  
"
Gentlemen
,
how
do
it
seem
to
you
,
to
go
,
in
front
?
"
  
<EOS>
Herbert
say
from
behind
(
at
the
same
time
poke
me
)
,
"
capitally
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
say
"
capitally
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
like
my
reading
of
the
character
,
gentleman
?
<EOS>
"
say
Mr
Waldengarver
,
almost
,
if
not
quite
,
with
patronage
.
  
<EOS>
Herbert
say
from
behind
(
again
poke
me
)
,
"
massive
and
concrete
.
"
<EOS>
so
I
say
boldly
,
as
if
I
have
originate
it
,
and
must
beg
to
insist
upon
it
,
"
massive
and
concrete
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
have
your
approbation
,
gentleman
,
"
say
Mr
Waldengarver
,
with
an
air
of
dignity
,
in
spite
of
his
be
ground
against
the
wall
at
the
time
,
and
hold
on
by
the
seat
of
the
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
tell
you
one
thing
,
<EOS>
Mr
Waldengarver
,
"
say
the
man
who
be
on
his
knee
,
"
in
which
you
be
out
in
your
reading
.
<EOS>
now
mind
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
who
say
contrairy
;
I
tell
you
so
.
<EOS>
You
be
out
in
your
reading
of
Hamlet
when
you
get
your
leg
in
profile
.
<EOS>
the
last
Hamlet
as
I
dress
,
make
the
same
mistake
in
his
reading
at
rehearsal
,
till
I
get
him
to
put
a
large
red
wafer
on
each
of
his
shin
,
and
then
at
that
rehearsal
(
which
be
the
last
)
<EOS>
I
go
in
front
,
sir
,
to
the
back
of
the
pit
,
and
<EOS>
whenever
his
reading
bring
him
into
profile
,
I
call
out
"
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
no
wafer
!
"
<EOS>
and
at
night
his
reading
be
lovely
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Waldengarver
smile
at
me
,
as
much
as
to
say
"
a
faithful
dependent
---
I
overlook
his
folly
;
"
and
then
say
aloud
,
"
My
view
be
a
little
classic
and
thoughtful
for
them
here
;
but
they
will
improve
,
they
will
improve
.
"
  
<EOS>
Herbert
<EOS>
and
I
say
together
,
<EOS>
oh
,
no
doubt
they
would
improve
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
observe
,
gentleman
,
"
say
Mr
Waldengarver
,
"
that
there
be
a
man
in
the
gallery
who
endeavour
to
cast
derision
on
the
service
---
I
mean
,
the
representation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
basely
reply
that
we
rather
think
we
have
notice
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
I
add
,
"
He
be
drunk
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr
Wopsle
,
"
not
drunk
.
<EOS>
His
employer
would
see
to
that
,
sir
.
<EOS>
His
employer
would
not
allow
him
to
be
drunk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
his
employer
?
"
say
I.
  
Mr
Wopsle
shut
his
eye
,
and
open
them
again
;
perform
both
ceremony
very
slowly
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
observe
,
gentleman
,
"
say
he
,
"
an
ignorant
and
a
blatant
ass
,
with
a
rasp
throat
and
a
countenance
expressive
of
low
malignity
,
who
go
through
---
I
will
not
say
sustain
---
<EOS>
the
role
(
if
I
may
use
a
french
expression
)
of
Claudius
King
of
Denmark
.
<EOS>
that
be
his
employer
,
gentleman
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
profession
!
"
  
<EOS>
without
distinctly
know
whether
I
should
have
be
more
sorry
for
Mr
Wopsle
if
he
have
be
in
despair
,
I
be
so
sorry
for
him
as
it
be
,
that
I
take
the
opportunity
of
his
turning
round
to
have
his
brace
put
on
---
which
jostle
us
out
at
the
doorway
---
to
ask
Herbert
what
he
think
of
have
him
home
to
supper
?
<EOS>
Herbert
say
he
think
it
would
be
kind
to
do
so
;
therefore
I
invite
him
,
and
he
go
to
Barnard
's
with
us
,
wrap
up
to
the
eye
,
and
we
do
our
good
for
him
,
and
he
sit
until
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
review
his
success
and
develop
his
plan
.
<EOS>
I
forget
in
detail
what
they
be
,
but
I
have
a
general
recollection
that
he
be
to
begin
with
revive
the
Drama
,
and
to
end
with
crush
it
;
inasmuch
as
his
decease
would
leave
it
utterly
bereft
and
without
a
chance
or
hope
.
  
<EOS>
miserably
I
go
to
bed
after
all
,
and
miserably
think
of
Estella
,
and
miserably
dream
that
my
expectation
be
all
cancel
,
and
that
I
have
to
give
my
hand
in
marriage
to
Herbert
's
  
Clara
,
or
play
Hamlet
to
Miss
Havisham
's
Ghost
,
before
twenty
thousand
people
,
without
know
twenty
word
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
32
 
one
day
when
I
be
busy
with
my
book
and
Mr
Pocket
,
I
receive
a
note
by
the
post
,
the
mere
outside
of
which
throw
me
into
a
great
flutter
;
for
,
though
I
have
never
see
the
handwriting
in
which
it
be
address
<EOS>
,
I
divine
whose
hand
it
be
.
<EOS>
It
have
no
set
beginning
,
as
Dear
Mr
Pip
,
or
Dear
Pip
,
or
Dear
Sir
,
or
Dear
Anything
,
but
run
thus
:
  
"
I
be
to
come
to
London
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
by
the
mid
-
day
coach
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
settle
you
should
meet
me
?
<EOS>
at
all
event
Miss
Havisham
have
that
impression
,
and
I
write
in
obedience
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
send
you
her
regard
.
<EOS>
---
your
,
ESTELLA
.
"
   
<EOS>
if
there
have
be
time
,
I
should
probably
have
order
several
suit
of
clothe
for
this
occasion
;
but
as
there
be
not
,
I
be
fain
to
be
content
with
those
I
have
.
<EOS>
My
appetite
vanish
instantly
,
and
I
know
no
peace
or
rest
until
the
day
arrive
.
<EOS>
not
that
its
arrival
bring
me
either
;
for
,
then
I
be
bad
than
ever
,
and
begin
haunt
the
coach
-
office
in
Wood
-
street
,
Cheapside
,
before
the
coach
have
leave
the
Blue
Boar
in
our
town
.
<EOS>
for
all
that
I
know
this
perfectly
well
<EOS>
,
I
still
feel
as
if
it
be
not
safe
to
let
the
coach
-
office
be
out
of
my
sight
longer
than
five
minute
at
a
time
;
and
in
this
condition
of
unreason
I
have
perform
the
first
half
-
hour
of
a
watch
of
four
or
five
hour
,
when
Wemmick
run
against
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
,
Mr
Pip
,
"
say
he
;
"
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
I
should
hardly
have
think
this
be
 
<EOS>
\
your
\
 
beat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
explain
that
I
be
wait
to
meet
somebody
who
be
come
up
by
coach
,
and
I
inquire
after
the
Castle
and
the
aged
.
  
<EOS>
"
both
flourishing
,
thankye
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
and
particularly
the
aged
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
wonderful
feather
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
eighty
-
two
next
birthday
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
notion
of
fire
eighty
-
two
time
,
if
the
neighbourhood
should
not
complain
,
and
that
cannon
of
mine
should
prove
equal
to
the
pressure
.
<EOS>
however
,
this
be
not
London
talk
.
<EOS>
mere
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
be
go
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
to
the
office
?
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
for
he
be
tend
in
that
direction
.
  
<EOS>
"
next
thing
to
it
,
"
return
Wemmick
,
"
I
be
go
to
Newgate
.
<EOS>
We
be
in
a
banker's
-
parcel
case
just
at
present
,
and
I
have
be
down
the
road
take
a
squint
at
the
scene
of
action
,
and
thereupon
must
have
a
word
or
two
with
our
client
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
your
client
commit
the
robbery
?
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
bless
your
soul
and
body
,
no
,
"
answer
Wemmick
,
very
drily
.
"
<EOS>
but
he
be
accuse
of
it
.
<EOS>
so
may
you
or
I
be
.
<EOS>
either
of
us
may
be
accuse
of
it
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
only
neither
of
us
be
,
"
I
remark
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yah
!
"
say
Wemmick
,
touch
me
on
the
breast
with
his
forefinger
;
"
you
be
a
deep
one
,
Mr
Pip
!
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
have
a
look
at
Newgate
?
<EOS>
have
you
time
to
spare
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
so
much
time
to
spare
,
that
the
proposal
come
as
a
relief
,
notwithstanding
its
irreconcilability
with
my
latent
desire
to
keep
my
eye
on
the
coach
-
office
.
<EOS>
mutter
that
I
would
make
the
inquiry
whether
I
have
time
to
walk
with
him
,
I
go
into
the
office
,
and
ascertain
from
the
clerk
with
the
nice
precision
and
much
to
the
trying
of
his
temper
,
the
early
moment
at
which
the
coach
could
be
expect
---
which
I
know
beforehand
,
quite
as
well
as
he
.
<EOS>
I
then
rejoin
Mr
Wemmick
,
and
affect
to
consult
my
watch
and
to
be
surprise
by
the
information
I
have
receive
,
accept
his
offer
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
at
Newgate
in
a
few
minute
,
and
we
pass
through
the
lodge
where
some
fetter
be
hang
up
on
the
bare
wall
among
the
prison
rule
,
into
the
interior
of
the
jail
.
<EOS>
at
that
time
,
jail
be
much
neglect
,
and
the
period
of
exaggerated
reaction
consequent
on
all
public
wrong
-
doing
---
and
which
be
always
its
heavy
and
long
punishment
---
be
still
far
off
.
<EOS>
so
,
felon
be
not
lodge
and
feed
better
than
soldier
(
to
say
nothing
of
pauper
)
,
and
seldom
set
fire
to
their
prison
with
the
excusable
object
of
improve
the
flavour
of
their
soup
.
<EOS>
It
be
visit
time
when
Wemmick
take
me
in
;
and
a
potman
be
go
his
round
with
beer
;
and
the
prisoner
,
behind
bar
in
yard
,
be
buy
beer
,
and
talk
to
friend
;
and
a
frouzy
,
ugly
,
disorderly
,
depressing
scene
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
It
strike
me
that
Wemmick
walk
among
the
prisoner
,
much
as
a
gardener
may
walk
among
his
plant
.
<EOS>
this
be
first
put
into
my
head
by
his
see
a
shoot
that
have
come
up
in
the
night
,
and
say
,
"
what
,
Captain
Tom
?
<EOS>
be
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
you
\
 
there
?
<EOS>
ah
,
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
and
also
"
be
that
Black
Bill
behind
the
cistern
?
<EOS>
why
I
do
not
look
for
you
these
two
month
;
how
do
you
find
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
equally
in
his
stopping
at
the
bar
and
attend
to
anxious
whisperer
---
always
singly
---
Wemmick
with
his
post
-
office
in
an
immovable
state
,
look
at
them
while
in
conference
,
as
if
he
be
take
particular
notice
of
the
advance
they
have
make
,
since
last
observe
,
towards
come
out
in
full
blow
at
their
trial
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
highly
popular
,
and
I
find
that
he
take
the
familiar
department
of
Mr
Jaggers
's
business
:
though
something
of
the
state
of
Mr
Jaggers
hang
about
him
too
,
forbid
approach
beyond
certain
limit
.
<EOS>
His
personal
recognition
of
each
successive
client
be
comprise
in
a
nod
,
and
in
his
settle
his
hat
a
little
easy
on
his
head
with
both
hand
,
and
then
tighten
the
post
-
office
,
and
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
in
one
or
two
instance
,
there
be
a
difficulty
respect
the
raising
of
fee
,
and
then
Mr
Wemmick
,
back
as
far
as
possible
from
the
insufficient
money
produce
,
say
,
"
It
be
no
use
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
a
subordinate
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
take
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
go
on
in
that
way
with
a
subordinate
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
unable
to
make
up
your
quantum
,
my
boy
,
you
have
well
address
yourself
to
a
principal
;
there
be
plenty
of
principal
in
the
profession
,
you
know
,
and
what
be
not
worth
the
while
of
one
,
may
be
worth
the
while
of
another
;
that
be
my
recommendation
to
you
,
speak
as
a
subordinate
.
<EOS>
do
not
try
on
useless
measure
.
<EOS>
why
should
you
?
<EOS>
now
,
who
be
next
?
"
  
<EOS>
thus
,
we
walk
through
Wemmick
's
greenhouse
,
until
he
turn
to
me
and
say
,
"
notice
the
man
I
shall
shake
hand
with
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
do
so
,
without
the
preparation
,
as
he
have
shake
hand
with
no
one
yet
.
  
<EOS>
almost
as
soon
as
he
have
speak
,
a
portly
upright
man
(
whom
I
can
see
now
,
as
I
write
)
in
a
well
-
wear
olive
-
colour
frock
-
coat
,
with
a
peculiar
pallor
over
-
spread
the
red
in
his
complexion
,
and
eye
that
go
wander
about
when
he
try
to
fix
them
,
come
up
to
a
corner
of
the
bar
,
and
put
his
hand
to
his
hat
---
which
have
a
greasy
and
fatty
surface
like
cold
broth
---
with
a
half
-

<EOS>
with
that

he
look
back

at

dead

cast
his

about

consider
what

would
go
best
in

<EOS>
as
we
come
out
of

prison
through

lodge

I
find
that
the
great
importance
of
my
guardian
be
appreciate
by
the
turnkey

no

by
those
whom
they
hold

Wemmick

suddenly
hit
out
at

laugh
,
and
give
us
good
day
,
and
stand
laugh
at
us
over
the
spike
of

descend
the
step
into

street

<EOS>
"
mind
you
,
Mr

"
say
Wemmick
,
gravely
in
my
ear
,
as
he
take
my
arm
to
be
more
confidential
;
"
I
do
not
know
that
Mr

do
a
well
thing

the
way
in
which
he
keep
himself
so
high

<EOS>
He
be
always
so
high

His
constant
height
be
of

no

him

then
,
between

in

not

<EOS>

<EOS>
and
so
he
have
'em
,
soul

body

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
impressed
,
and
not
for
the
first
time
,
by
my
guardian
's
subtlety
.
<EOS>
to
confess
the
truth
,
I
very
heartily
wish
,
and
not
for
the
first
time
,
that
I
have
have
some
other
guardian
of
minor
ability
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Wemmick
and
I
part
at
the
office
in
Little
Britain
,
where
suppliant
for
Mr
Jaggers
's
notice
be
linger
about
as
usual
,
and
I
return
to
my
watch
in
the
street
of
the
coach
-
office
,
with
some
three
hour
on
hand
.
<EOS>
I
consume
the
whole
time
in
think
how
strange
it
be
that
I
should
be
encompass
by
all
this
taint
of
prison
and
crime
;
that
,
in
my
childhood
out
on
our
lonely
marsh
on
a
winter
evening
I
should
have
first
encounter
it
;
that
,
it
should
have
reappear
on
two
occasion
,
start
out
like
a
stain
that
be
fade
but
not
go
;
that
,
it
should
in
this
new
way
pervade
my
fortune
and
advancement
.
<EOS>
while
my
mind
be
thus
engage
,
I
think
of
the
beautiful
young
Estella
,
proud
and
refined
,
come
towards
me
,
and
I
think
with
absolute
abhorrence
of
the
contrast
between
the
jail
and
her
.
<EOS>
I
wish
that
Wemmick
have
not
meet
me
,
or
that
I
have
not
yield
to
him
and
go
with
him
,
so
that
,
of
all
day
in
the
year
on
this
day
,
I
may
not
have
have
Newgate
in
my
breath
and
on
my
clothe
.
<EOS>
I
beat
the
prison
dust
off
my
foot
as
I
saunter
to
and
fro
,
and
I
shake
it
out
of
my
dress
,
and
I
exhale
its
air
from
my
lung
.
<EOS>
so
contaminate
do
I
feel
,
remember
who
be
come
,
that
the
coach
come
quickly
after
all
,
and
I
be
not
yet
free
from
the
soil
consciousness
of
Mr
Wemmick
's
conservatory
,
when
I
see
her
face
at
the
coach
window
and
her
hand
wave
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
what
 
\
be
\
 
<EOS>
the
nameless
shadow
which
again
in
that
one
instant
have
pass
?
    
<EOS>
chapter

in
her
fur
travelling
-
dress
<EOS>
,
Estella
seem
more
delicately
beautiful
than
she
have
ever
seem
yet
,
even
in
my
eye
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
more
win
than
she
have
care
to
let
it
be
to
me
before
,
and
I
think
I
see
Miss
Havisham
's
influence
in
the
change
.
  
<EOS>
We
stand
in
the
Inn
Yard
while
she
point
out
her
luggage
to
me
,
and
when
it
be
all
collect
I
remember
---
have
forget
everything
but
herself
in
the
meanwhile
---
that
I
know
nothing
of
her
destination
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
Richmond
,
"
she
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
Our
lesson
be
,
that
there
be
two
Richmonds
,
one
in
Surrey
and
one
in
Yorkshire
,
and
that
mine
be
the
Surrey
Richmond
.
<EOS>
the
distance
be
ten
mile
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
have
a
carriage
,
and
you
be
to
take
me
.
<EOS>
this
be
my
purse
,
and
you
be
to
pay
my
charge
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
oh
,
you
must
take
the
purse
!
<EOS>
We
have
no
choice
,
you
and
I
,
but
to
obey
our
instruction
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
free
to
follow
our
own
device
,
you
and
I.
"
  
<EOS>
as
she
look
at
me
in
give
me
the
purse
,
I
hope
there
be
an
inner
meaning
in
her
word
.
<EOS>
She
say
them
slightingly
,
but
not
with
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
carriage
will
have
to
be
send
for
,
Estella
.
<EOS>
Will
you
rest
here
a
little
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
to
rest
here
a
little
,
and
I
be
to
drink
some
tea
,
and
you
be
to
take
care
of
me
the
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
draw
her
arm
through
mine
,
as
if
it
must
be
do
,
and
I
request
a
waiter
who
have
be
stare
at
the
coach
like
a
man
who
have
never
see
such
a
thing
in
his
life
,
to
show
us
a
private
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
upon
that
,
he
pull
out
a
napkin
,
as
if
it
be
a
magic
clue
without
which
he
could
not
find
the
way
up
-
stair
,
and
lead
us
to
the
black
hole
of
the
establishment
:
fit
up
with
a
diminish
mirror
(
quite
a
superfluous
article
consider
the
hole
's
proportion
)
,
an
anchovy
sauce
-
cruet
,
and
somebody
's
patten
.
<EOS>
on
my
objecting
to
this
retreat
,
he
take
us
into
another
room
with
a
dinner
-
table
for
thirty
,
and
in
the
grate
a
scorched
leaf
of
a
copy
-
book
under
a
bushel
of
coal
-
dust
.
<EOS>
have
look
at
this
extinct
conflagration
and
shake
his
head
,
he
take
my
order
:
which
,
prove
to
be
merely
"
some
tea
for
the
lady
,
"
send
him
out
of
the
room
in
a
very
low
state
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
,
and
I
be
,
sensible
that
the
air
of
this
chamber
,
in
its
strong
combination
of
stable
with
soup
-
stock
,
may
have
lead
one
to
infer
that
the
coach
department
be
not
do
well
,
and
that
the
enterprising
proprietor
be
boil
down
the
horse
for
the
refreshment
department
.
<EOS>
yet
the
room
be
all
in
all
to
me
,
Estella
be
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
with
her
I
could
have
be
happy
there
for
life
.
<EOS>
(
I
be
not
at
all
happy
there
at
the
time
,
observe
,
and
I
know
it
well
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
go
to
,
at
Richmond
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
Estella
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
live
,
"
say
she
,
"
at
a
great
expense
,
with
a
lady
there
,
who
have
the
power
---
or
say
she
have
---
of
take
me
about
,
and
introduce
me
,
and
show
people
to
me
and
show
me
to
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
will
be
glad
of
variety
and
admiration
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
suppose
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
answer
so
carelessly
,
that
I
say
,
"
You
speak
of
yourself
as
if
you
be
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
do
you
learn
how
I
speak
of
other
?
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
"
say
Estella
,
smile
delightfully
,
"
you
must
not
expect
me
to
go
to
school
to
you
;
I
must
talk
in
my
own
way

how
do
you
thrive
with
Mr
Pocket
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
live
quite
pleasantly
there
;
at
least
---

It
appear
to
me
that
I
be
lose
a
chance
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
least
?

repeat
Estella

<EOS>
"
as
pleasantly

I
could
anywhere

away
from
you

You
silly
boy

Estella
,
quite
composedly
,
"
how
can
you
talk
such
nonsense

<EOS>
Your
friend
Mr
Matthew

I
believe
,
be
superior
to
the
rest
of
his
family

<EOS>

very
superior
indeed

He
be
nobody

enemy

"
do
not
add
but
<EOS>
his
own
,
"
interpose
Estella
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
hate
that
class
of
man

he
really
be
disintereste
,

above
small
jealousy

spite

I
have
hear
?

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
have
every
reason
to
say
so

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
every
reason
to
say
so
of
the
rest
of
his
people

say
Estella
,
nod
at
me
with
an
expression
of
face
that
be
at
once
grave
and
rally
,
"
for
they
beset
Miss
Havisham
with
report
and
insinuation
to
your
disadvantage

<EOS>
They
watch
you
,
misrepresent
you

write
letter
about
you
(
anonymous
sometimes
)

you
be
the
torment
and
the
occupation

You
can
scarcely
realize

yourself
the
hatred
those
people
feel

They
do
me
no

burst
out
laughing
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
singular
to
me
,
and
I
look
at
her
in
considerable
perplexity
.
<EOS>
when
she
leave
off
---
and
she
have
not
laugh
languidly
,
but
with
real
enjoyment
---
I
say
,
in
my
diffident
way
with
her
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
may
suppose
that
you
would
not
be
amuse
if
they
do
me
any
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
you
may
be
sure
of
that
,
"
say
Estella
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
certain
that
I
laugh
because
they
fail
.
<EOS>
oh
,
those
people
with
Miss
Havisham
,
and
the
torture
they
undergo
!
"
<EOS>
She
laugh
again
,
and
even
now
when
she
have
tell
me
why
,
her
laughter
be
very
singular
to
me
,
for
I
could
not
doubt
its
be
genuine
,
and
yet
it
seem
too
much
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
must
really
be
something
more
here
than
I
know
;
she
see
the
thought
in
my
mind
,
and
answer
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
easy
for
even
you
,
"
say
Estella
,
"
to
know
what
satisfaction
it
give
me
to
see
those
people
thwart
,
or
what
an
enjoyable
sense
of
the
ridiculous
I
have
when
they
be
make
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
for
you
be
not
bring
up
in
that
strange
house
from
a
mere
baby
.
<EOS>
---
I
be
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
your
little
wit
sharpen
by
their
intriguing
against
you
,
suppress
and
defenceless
,
under
the
mask
of
sympathy
and
pity
and
what
not
that
be
soft
and
soothing
.
<EOS>
---
I
have
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
gradually
open
your
round
childish
eye
wider
and
wide
to
the
discovery
of
that
impostor
of
a
woman
who
calculate
her
store
of
peace
of
mind
for
when
she
wake
up
in
the
night

<EOS>
---
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
laugh
matter
with
Estella
now
,
nor
be
she
summon
these
remembrance
from
any
shallow
place
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
be
the
cause
of
that
look
of
hers
,
for
all
my
expectation
in
a
heap
.
  
<EOS>
"
two
thing
I
can
tell
you
,
"
say
Estella
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
first
,
notwithstanding
the
proverb
that
constant
dropping
will
wear
away
a
stone
,
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
that
these
people
never
will
---
never
would
,
in
a
hundred
year
---
impair
your
ground
with
Miss
Havisham
,
in
any
particular
,
great
or
small
.
<EOS>
second
,
I
be
behold
to
you
as
the
cause
of
their
be
so
busy
<EOS>
and
so
mean
in
vain
,
and
<EOS>
there
be
my
hand
upon
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
she
give
it
me
playfully
---
for
her
darker
mood
have
be
but
momentary
<EOS>
---
I
hold
it
and
put
it
to
my
lip
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
ridiculous
boy
,
"
say
Estella
,
"
will
you
never
take
warning
?
<EOS>
or
do
you
kiss
my
hand
in
the
same
spirit
in
which
I
once
let
you
kiss
my
cheek
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
spirit
be
that
?
"
say
I.
  
"
I
must
think
a
moment
.
<EOS>
a
spirit
of
contempt
for
the
fawner
and
plotter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
say
yes
,
may
I
kiss
the
cheek
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
ask
before
you
touch
the
hand
.
<EOS>
but
,
yes
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
lean
down
,
and
her
calm
face
be
like
a
statue
's
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
"
say
Estella
,
glide
away
the
instant
I
touch
her
cheek
,
"
you
be
to
take
care
that
I
have
some
tea
,
and
you
be
to
take
me
to
Richmond

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
reverting
to
this
tone
as
if
our
association
be
force
upon
us
and
we
be
mere
puppet
,
give
me
pain
;
but
everything
in
our
intercourse
do
give
me
pain
.
<EOS>
whatever
her
tone
with
me
happen
to
be
,
I
could
put
no
trust
in
it
,
and
build
no
hope
on
it
;
and
yet
I
go
on
against
trust
and
against
hope
.
<EOS>
why
repeat
it
a
thousand
time
?
<EOS>
so
it
always
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
ring
for
the
tea
,
and
the
waiter
,
reappear
with
his
magic
clue
,
bring
in
by
degree
some
fifty
adjunct
to
that
refreshment
but
of
tea
not
a
glimpse
.
<EOS>
a
teaboard

cup

triangular

and
ultimately
a
fat
family
urn
:
which
the
waiter
stagger
in
with

express
in
his
countenance
burden
and
suffering

<EOS>
after
a
prolonged
absence
at
this
stage
of
the
entertainment

he
at
length
come
back
with
a
casket
of
precious
appearance

<EOS>
these
I
steep
in
hot
water

and
so
from
the
whole

extract
one
cup
of
<EOS>
I
do
not

what

for
Estella

<EOS>
the
bill
pay

and
the
waiter
remember
,
and
the
ostler
not

,
and
the
chambermaid
take
into
consideration
---
in
a
word
,
the
whole
house
bribe
into
a
state
of
contempt
and
animosity
,
and
Estella
's
purse
much
lighten
---
we
get
into
our
post
-
coach
and
drive
away
.
<EOS>
turn
into
Cheapside
and
rattle
up
Newgate
-
street
,
we
be
soon
under
the
wall
of
which
I
be
so
ashamed
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
place
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
Estella
ask
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
a
foolish
pretence
of
not
at
first
recognize
it
,
and
then
tell
her
.
<EOS>
as
she
look
at
it
,
and
draw
in
her
head
again
,
murmur
"
wretch
!
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
have
confess
to
my
visit
for
any
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jaggers
,
"
say
I
,
by
way
of
put
it
neatly
on
somebody
else
,
"
have
the
reputation
of
be
more
in
the
secret
of
that
dismal
place
than
any
man
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
more
in
the
secret
of
every
place
,
I
think
,
"
say
Estella
,
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
accustom
to
see
him
often
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
have
be
accustom
to
see
him
at
uncertain
interval
,
ever
since
I
can
remember
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
him
no
better
now
,
than
I
do
before
I
could
speak
plainly
.
<EOS>
what
be
your
own
experience
of
him
?
<EOS>
do
you
advance
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
once
habituate
to
his
distrustful
manner
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
have
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
intimate
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
dine
with
him
at
his
private
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
,
"
say
Estella
,
shrink
,
"
that
must
be
a
curious
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
curious
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
chary
of
discuss
my
guardian
too
freely
even
with
her
;
but
I
should
have
go
on
with
the
subject
so
far
as
to
describe
the
dinner
in
Gerrard
-
street
,
if
we
have
not
then
come
into
a
sudden
glare
of
gas
.
<EOS>
It
seem
,
while
it
last
,
to
be
all
alight
and
alive
with
that
inexplicable
feeling
I
have
have
before
;
<EOS>
and
when
we
be
out
of
it
,
I
be
as
much
daze
for
a
few
moment
as
if
I
have
be
in
lightning
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
we
fall
into
other
talk
,
and
it
be
principally
about
the
way
by
which
we
be
travel
,
and
about
what
part
of
London
lie
on
this
side
of
it
,
and
what
on
that
.
<EOS>
the
great
city
be
almost
new
to
her
,
she
tell
me
,
for
she
have
never
leave
Miss
Havisham
's
neighbourhood
until
she
have
go
to
France
,
and
she
have
merely
pass
through
London
then
in
go
and
return
.
<EOS>
I
ask
her
if
my
guardian
have
any
charge
of
her
while
she
remain
here
?
<EOS>
to
that
she
emphatically
say
"
God
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
and
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
avoid
see
that
she
care
to
attract
me
;
that
she
make
herself
win
;
and
would
have
win
me
even
if
the
task
have
need
pain
.
<EOS>
yet
this
make
me
none
the
happy
,
for
,
even
if
she
have
not
take
that
tone
of
our
be
dispose
of
by
other
,
I
should
have
feel
that
she
hold
my
heart
in
her
hand
because
she
wilfully
choose
to
do
it
,
and
not
because
it
would
have
wring
any
tenderness
in
her
,
to
crush
it
and
throw
it
away
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
pass
through
Hammersmith
,
I
show
her
where
Mr
Matthew
Pocket
live
,
and
say
it
be
no
great
way
from
Richmond
,
and
that
I
hope
I
should
see
her
sometimes
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
you
be
to
see
me
;
you
be
to
come
when
you
think
proper
;
you
be
to
be
mention
to
the
family
;
indeed
you
be
already
mention
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
inquire
be
it
a
large
household
she
be
go
to
be
a
member
of
?
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
there
be
only
two
;
mother
and
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
mother
be
a
lady
of
some
station
,
though
not
averse
to
increase
her
income
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
Miss
Havisham
could
part
with
you
again
so
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
part
of
Miss
Havisham
's
plan
for
me
,
Pip
,
"
say
Estella
,
with
a
sigh
,
as
if
she
be
tired
;
"
I
be
to
write
to
her
constantly
and
see
her
regularly
,
and
report
how
I
go
on
---
I
and
the
jewel
---
for
they
be
nearly
all
mine
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
she
have
ever
call
me
by
my
name
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
do
so
,
purposely
,
and
know
that
I
should
treasure
it
up
.
  
<EOS>
We
come
to
Richmond
all
too
soon
,
and
our
destination
there
,
be
a
house
by
the
Green
;
a
staid
old
house
,
where
hoop
and
powder
and
patch
,
embroidered
coat
roll
stocking
ruffle
and
sword
,
have
have
their
court
day
many
a
time
.
<EOS>
some
ancient
tree
before
the
house
be
still
cut
into
fashion
as
formal
and
unnatural
as
the
hoop
and
wig
and
stiff
skirt
;
but
their
own
allot
place
in
the
great
procession
of
the
dead
be
not
far
off
,
and
they
would
soon
drop
into
them
and
go
the
silent
way
of
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
a
bell
with
an
old
voice
---
which
I
dare
say
in
its
time
have
often
say
to
the
house
,
here
be
the
green
farthingale
,
here
be
the
diamond
-
hilte
sword
,
here
be
the
shoe
with
red
heel
and
the
blue
solitaire
,
---
sound
gravely
in
the
moonlight
,
and
two
cherry
-
colour
maid
come
flutter
out
to
receive
Estella
.
<EOS>
the
doorway
soon
absorb
her
box
,
and
she
give
me
her
hand
and
a
smile
,
and
say
good
night
,
and
be
absorb
likewise
.
<EOS>
and
still
I
stand
look
at
the
house
,
think
how
happy
I
should
be
if
I
live
there
with
her
,
and
know
that
I
never
be
happy
with
her
,
but
always
miserable
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
into
the
carriage
to
be
take
back
to
Hammersmith
,
and
I
get
in
with
a
bad
heart
-
ache
,
and
I
get
out
with
a
bad
heart
-
ache
.
<EOS>
at
our
own
door
,
I
find
little
Jane
Pocket
come
home
from
a
little
party
escort
by
her
little
lover
;
and
I
envy
her
little
lover
,
in
spite
of
his
be
subject
to
Flopson
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Pocket
be
out
lecture

for

he
be
a
most
delightful
lecturer
on
domestic
economy

and
his
treatise
on
the
management
of
child

servant
be
consider
the
very
good
text

book
on

theme

but

little
difficulty

him
quiet

unaccountable

and
more

as
quite
wholesome
for

to

<EOS>
Mr

be
justly
celebrate

most
excellent
practical
advice

for

a
clear
and
sound

I
have
some
notion
in

ache
of

<EOS>
but
,
happen
to
look
up
at
Mrs
Pocket
as
she
sit
read
her
book
of
dignity
after

Bed

s
<EOS>
I
have
grow
accustomed
to
my
expectation
<EOS>
,
I
have
insensibly
begin
to
notice
their
effect
upon
myself
and
those
around
me
.
<EOS>
Their
influence
on
my
own
character
,
I
disguise
from
my
recognition
as
much
as
possible
,
but
I
know
very
well
that
it
be
not
all
good
.
<EOS>
I
live
in
a
state
of
chronic
uneasiness
respect
my
behaviour
to
Joe
.
<EOS>
My
conscience
be
not
by
any
mean
comfortable
about
Biddy
.
<EOS>
when
I
wake
up
in
the
night---
like
Camilla
---
I
use
to
think
,
with
a
weariness
on
my
spirit
,
that
I
should
have
be
happy
and
well
if
I
have
never
see
Miss
Havisham
's
face
,
and
have
rise
to
manhood
content
to
be
partner
with
Joe
in
the
honest
old
forge
.
<EOS>
many
a
time
of
an
evening
,
when
I
sit
alone
look
at
the
fire
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
after
all
,
there
be
no
fire
like
the
forge
fire
and
the
kitchen
fire
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
Estella
be
so
inseparable
from
all
my
restlessness
and
disquiet
of
mind
,
that
I
really
fall
into
confusion
as
to
the
limit
of
my
own
part
in
its
production
.
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
suppose
I
have
have
no
expectation
,
and
yet
have
have
Estella
to
think
of
,
I
could
not
make
out
to
my
satisfaction
that
I
should
have
do
much
well
.
<EOS>
now
,
concern
the
influence
of
my
position
on
other
,
I
be
in
no
such
difficulty
,
and
so
I
perceive
---
<EOS>
though
dimly
enough
perhaps
---
that
it
be
not
beneficial
to
anybody
,
and
,
above
all
,
that
it
be
not
beneficial
to
Herbert
.
<EOS>
My
lavish
habit
lead
his
easy
nature
into
expense
that
he
could
not
afford
,
corrupt
the
simplicity
of
his
life
,
and
disturb
his
peace
with
anxiety
and
regret
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
remorseful
for
have
unwittingly
set
those
other
branch
of
the
Pocket
family
to
the
poor
art
they
practise
:
because
such
littleness
be
their
natural
bent
,
and
would
have
be
evoke
by
anybody
else
,
if
I
have
leave
them
slumber
.
<EOS>
but
Herbert
's
be
a
very
different
case
,
and
it
often
cause
me
a
twinge
to
think
that
I
have
do
him
evil
service
in
crowd
his
sparely
-
furnish
chamber
with
incongruous
upholstery
work
,
and
place
the
canary
-
breast
Avenger
at
his
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
so
now
,
as
an
infallible
way
of
make
little
ease
<EOS>
great
ease
<EOS>
,
I
begin
to
contract
a
quantity
of
debt
.
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
begin
but
Herbert
must
begin
too
,
so
he
soon
follow
.
<EOS>
at
Startop
's
suggestion
,
we
put
ourselves
down
for
election
into
a
club
call
the
Finches
of
the
Grove
:
the
object
of
which
institution
<EOS>
I
have
never
divine
,
if
it
be
not
that
the
member
should
dine
expensively
once
a
fortnight
,
to
quarrel
among
themselves
as
much
as
possible
after
dinner
,
and
to
cause
six
waiter
to
get
drunk
on
the
stair
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
these
gratify
social
end
be
so
invariably
accomplished
,
that
Herbert
and
I
understand
nothing
else
to
be
refer
to
in
the
first
standing
toast
of
the
society
:
which
run
"
Gentlemen
,
may
the
present
promotion
of
good
feeling
ever
reign
predominant
among
the
Finches
of
the
Grove
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Finches
spend
their
money
foolishly
(
the
Hotel
we
dine
at
be
in
covent
-
garden
)
,
and
the
first
Finch
I
see
,
when
I
have
the
honour
of
join
the
Grove
,
be
Bentley
Drummle
:
at
that
time
flounder
about
town
in
a
cab
of
his
own
,
and
do
a
great
deal
of
damage
to
the
post
at
the
street
corner
.
<EOS>
occasionally
,
he
shoot
himself
out
of
his
equipage
head
-
foremost
over
the
apron
;
and
I
see
him
on
one
occasion
deliver
himself
at
the
door
of
the
Grove
in
this
unintentional
way
---
like
coal
.
<EOS>
but
here
I
anticipate
a
little
.
<EOS>
for
I
be
not
a
Finch
,
and
could
not
be
,
accord
to
the
sacred
law
of
the
society
,
until
I
come
of
age
.
  
<EOS>
in
my
confidence
in
my
own
resource
,
I
would
willingly
have
take
Herbert
's
expense
on
myself
;
but
Herbert
be
proud
,
and
I
could
make
no
such
proposal
to
him
.
<EOS>
so
,
he
get
into
difficulty
in
every
direction
,
and
continue
to
look
about
him
.
<EOS>
when
we
gradually
fall
into
keep
late
hour
and
late
company
,
I
notice
that
he
look
about
him
with
a
desponding
eye
at
breakfast
-
time
;
that
he
begin
to
look
about
him
more
hopefully
about
mid
-
day
;
that
he
droop
when
he
come
into
dinner
;
that
he
seem
to
descry
Capital
in
the
distance
rather
clearly
,
after
dinner
;
that
he
all
but
realize
Capital
towards
midnight
;
and
that
at
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
he
become
so
deeply
despondent
again
as
to
talk
of
buy
a
rifle
and
go
to
America
,
with
a
general
purpose
of
compel
buffalo
to
make
his
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
usually
at
Hammersmith
about
half
the
week
,
and
when
I
be
at
Hammersmith
<EOS>
I
haunt
Richmond
:
whereof
separately
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
Herbert
would
often
come
to
Hammersmith
when
I
be
there
,
and
I
think
at
those
season
his
father
would
occasionally
have
some
pass
perception
that
the
opening
he
be
look
for
,
have
not
appear
yet
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
general
tumble
up
of
the
family
,
his
tumble
out
in
life
somewhere
,
be
a
thing
to
transact
itself
somehow
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Mr
Pocket
grow
greyer
,
and
try
oftener
to
lift
himself
out
of
his
perplexity
by
the
hair
.
<EOS>
while
Mrs
Pocket
trip
up
the
family
with
her
footstool
,
read
her
book
of
dignity
,
lose
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
tell
us
about
her
grandpapa
,
and
teach
the
young
idea
how
to
shoot
,
by
shoot
it
into
bed
whenever
it
attract
her
notice
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
be
now
generalize
a
period
of
my
life
with
the
object
of
clear
my
way
before
me
,
I
can
scarcely
do
so
better
than
by
at
once
complete
the
description
of
our
usual
manner
and
custom
at
Barnard
's
Inn
.
  
<EOS>
We
spend
as
much
money
as
we
could
,
and
get
as
little
for
it
as
people
could
make
up
their
mind
to
give
us
.
<EOS>
We
be
always
more
or
less
miserable
,
and
most
of
our
acquaintance
be
in
the
same
condition
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
gay
fiction
among
us
that
we
be
constantly
enjoy
ourselves
,
and
a
skeleton
truth
that
we
never
do
.
<EOS>
to
the
good
of
my
belief
,
our
case
be
in
the
last
aspect
a
rather
common
one
.
  
<EOS>
every
morning
,
with
an
air
ever
new
,
Herbert
go
into
the
City
to
look
about
him
.
<EOS>
I
often
pay
him
a
visit
in
the
dark
back
-
room
in
which
he
consort
with
an
ink
-
jar
,
a
hat
-
peg
,
a
coal
-
box
,
a
string
-
box
,
an
almanack
,
a
desk
and
stool
,
and
a
ruler
;
and
I
do
not
remember
that
I
ever
see
him
do
anything
else
but
look
about
him
.
<EOS>
if
we
all
do
what
we
undertake
to
do
,
as
faithfully
as
Herbert
do
,
we
may
live
in
a
Republic
of
the
Virtues
.
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
poor
fellow
,
except
at
a
certain
hour
of
every
afternoon
to
"
go
to
Lloyd
's
"
---
in
observance
of
a
ceremony
of
see
his
principal
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
He
never
do
anything
else
in
connexion
with
Lloyd
's
that
I
could
find
out
,
except
come
back
again
.
<EOS>
when
he
feel
his
case
unusually
serious
,
and
that
he
positively
must
find
an
opening
,
he
would
go
on
'
change
at
a
busy
time
,
and
walk
in
and
out
,
in
a
kind
of
gloomy
country
dance
figure
,
among
the
assemble
magnate
.
<EOS>
"
for
,
"
say
Herbert
to
me
,
come
home
to
dinner
on
one
of
those
special
occasion
,
"
I
find
the
truth
to
be
,
Handel
,
that
an
opening
will
not
come
to
one
,
but
one
must
go
to
it
---
so
I
have
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
if
we
have
be
less
attach
to
one
another
,
I
think
we
must
have
hate
one
another
regularly
every
morning
.
<EOS>
I
detest
the
chamber
beyond
expression
at
that
period
of
repentance
,
and
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
the
Avenger
's
livery
:
which
have
a
more
expensive
and
a
less
remunerative
appearance
then
,
than
at
any
other
time
in
the
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
.
<EOS>
as
we
get
more
and
more
into
debt
,
breakfast
become
a
hollower
and
hollower
form
,
and
,
be
on
one
occasion
at
breakfast
-
time
threaten
(
by
letter
)
with
legal
proceeding
,
"
not
unwholly
unconnected
,
"
as
my
local
paper
may
put
it
,
"
with
jewellery
,
"
I
go
so
far
as
to
seize
the
Avenger
by
his
blue
collar
and
shake
him
off
his
foot
---
so
that
he
be
actually
in
the
air
,
like
a
booted
Cupid
---
for
presume
to
suppose
that
we
want
a
roll
.
  
<EOS>
at
certain
time
---
mean
at
uncertain
time
,
for
they
depend
on
our
humour
---
I
would
say
to
Herbert
,
as
if
it
be
a
remarkable
discovery
:
  
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Herbert
,
we
be
get
on
badly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Handel
,
"
Herbert
would
say
to
me
,
in
all
sincerity
,
"
if
you
will
believe
me
,
those
very
word
be
on
my
lip
,
by
a
strange
coincidence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
Herbert
,
"
I
would
respond
,
"
let
us
look
into
our
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
always
derive
profound
satisfaction
from
make
an
appointment
for
this
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
always
think
this
be
business
,
this
be
the
way
to
confront
the
thing
,
this
be
the
way
to
take
the
foe
by
the
throat
.
<EOS>
and
I
know
Herbert
think
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
We
order
something
rather
special
for
dinner
,
with
a
bottle
of
something
similarly
out
of
the
common
way
,
in
order
that
our
mind
may
be
fortify
for
the
occasion
,
and
we
may
come
well
up
to
the
mark
.
<EOS>
dinner
over
,
we
produce
a
bundle
of
pen
,
a
copious
supply
of
ink
,
and
a
goodly
show
of
write
and
blot
paper
.
<EOS>
for
,
there
be
something
very
comfortable
in
have
plenty
of
stationery
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
then
take
a
sheet
of
paper
,
and
write
across
the
top
of
it
,
in
a
neat
hand
,
the
heading
,
"
Memorandum
of
Pip
's
debt
;
"
with
Barnard
's
Inn
and
the
date
very
carefully
add
.
<EOS>
Herbert
would
also
take
a
sheet
of
paper
,
and
write
across
it
with
similar
formality
,
"
Memorandum
of
Herbert
's
debt
.
"
  
<EOS>
each
of
us
would
then
refer
to
a
confused
heap
of
paper
at
his
side
,
which
have
be
throw
into
drawer
,
wear
into
hole
in
pocket
,
half
-
burn
in
light
candle
,
stick
for
week
into
the
looking
-
glass
,
and
otherwise
damage
.
<EOS>
the
sound
of
our
pen
go
,
refresh
us
exceedingly
,
insomuch
that
I
sometimes
find
it
difficult
to
distinguish
between
this
edifying
business
proceeding
and
actually
pay
the
money
.
<EOS>
in
point
of
meritorious
character
,
the
two
thing
seem
about
equal
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
write
a
little
while
,
I
would
ask
Herbert
how
he
get
on
?
<EOS>
Herbert
probably
would
have
be
scratch
his
head
in
a
most
rueful
manner
at
the
sight
of
his
accumulating
figure
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
mount
up
,
Handel
,
"
Herbert
would
say
;
"
upon
my
life
,
they
be
mount
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
firm
,
Herbert
,
"
I
would
retort
,
ply
my
own
pen
with
great
assiduity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
look
the
thing
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
look
into
your
affair
.
<EOS>
stare
them
out
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
I
would
,
Handel
,
only
they
be
stare
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
\
 
out
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
however
,
my
determined
manner
would
have
its
effect
,
and
Herbert
would
fall
to
work
again
.
<EOS>
after
a
time
he
would
give
up
once
more
,
on
the
plea
that
he
have
not
get
Cobbs
's
bill
,
or
Lobbs
's
,
or
Nobbs
's
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
Herbert
estimate
;
estimate
it
in
round
number
,
and
put
it
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
fellow
of
resource
you
be
!
"
<EOS>
my
friend
would
reply
,
with
admiration
.
"
<EOS>
really
your
business
power
be
very
remarkable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
.
<EOS>
I
establish
with
myself
on
these
occasion
,
the
reputation
of
a
first
-
rate
man
of
business
---
prompt
,
decisive
,
energetic
,
clear
,
cool
-
headed
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
get
all
my
responsibility
down
upon
my
list
,
I
compare
each
with
the
bill
,
and
tick
it
off
.
<EOS>
My
self
-
approval
when
I
tick
an
entry
be
quite
a
luxurious
sensation
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
no
more
tick
to
make
,
I
fold
all
my
bill
up
uniformly
,
docket
each
on
the
back
,
and
tie
the
whole
into
a
symmetrical
bundle
.
<EOS>
then
I
do
the
same
for
Herbert
(
who
modestly
say
he
have
not
my
administrative
genius
)
,
and
feel
that
I
have
bring
his
affair
into
a
focus
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
business
habit
have
one
other
bright
feature
,
which
I
call
"
leave
a
Margin
.
<EOS>
"
for
example
;
suppose
Herbert
's
debt
to
be
one
hundred
and
sixty
-
four
pound
four
-
and
-
twopence
,
I
would
say
,
"
leave
a
margin
,
and
put
them
down
at
two
hundred
.
"
<EOS>
or
,
suppose
my
own
to
be
four
time
as
much
,
I
would
leave
a
margin
,
and
put
them
down
at
seven
hundred
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
high
opinion
of
the
wisdom
of
this
same
margin
,
but
I
be
bind
to
acknowledge
that
on
look
back
,
I
deem
it
to
have
be
an
expensive
device
.
<EOS>
for
,
we
always
run
into
new
debt
immediately
,
to
the
full
extent
of
the
margin
,
and
sometimes
,
in
the
sense
of
freedom
and
solvency
it
impart
,
get
pretty
far
on
into
another
margin
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
calm
,
a
rest
,
a
virtuous
hush
,
consequent
on
these
examination
of
our
affair
that
give
me
,
for
the
time
,
an
admirable
opinion
of
myself
.
<EOS>
soothe
by
my
exertion
,
my
method
,
and
Herbert
's
compliment
,
I
would
sit
with
his
symmetrical
bundle
and
my
own
on
the
table
before
me
among
the
stationery
,
and
feel
like
a
Bank
of
some
sort
,
rather
than
a
private
individual
.
  
<EOS>
We
shut
our
outer
door
on
these
solemn
occasion
,
in
order
that
we
may
not
be
interrupt
.
<EOS>
I
have
fall
into
my
serene
state
one
evening
,
when
we
hear
a
letter
drop
through
the
slit
in
the
say
door
,
and
fall
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
for
you
,
Handel
,
"
say
Herbert
,
go
out
and
come
back
with
it
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
hope
there
be
nothing
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
in

Chapter
35
 
it
be
the
first
time
that
a
grave
have
open
in
my
road
of
life
,
and
the
gap
it
make
in
the
smooth
ground
be
wonderful
.
<EOS>
the
figure
of
my
sister
in
her
chair
by
the
kitchen
fire
,
haunt
me
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
that
the
place
could
possibly
be
,
without
her
,
be
something
my
mind
seem
unable
to
compass
;
and
whereas
she
have
seldom
or
never
be
in
my
thought
of
late
,
I
have
now
the
strange
idea
that
she
be
come
towards
me
in
the
street
,
or
that
she
would
presently
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
in
my
room
too
,
with
which
she
have
never
be
at
all
associate
,
there
be
at
once
the
blankness
of
death
and
a
perpetual
suggestion
of
the
sound
of
her
voice
or
the
turn
of
her
face
or
figure
,
as
if
she
be
still
alive
and
have
be
often
there
.
  
<EOS>
whatever
my
fortune
may
have
be
,
I
could
scarcely
have
recall
my
sister
with
much
tenderness
.
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
there
be
a
shock
of
regret
which
may
exist
without
much
tenderness
.
<EOS>
under
its
influence
(
and
perhaps
to
make
up
for
the
want
of
the
soft
feeling
)
I
be
seize
with
a
violent
indignation
against
the
assailant
from
whom
she
have
suffer
so
much
;
and
I
feel
that
on
sufficient
proof
I
could
have
revengefully
pursue
Orlick
,
or
any
one
else
,
to
the
last
extremity
.
  
<EOS>
have
write
to
Joe
,
to
offer
consolation
,
and
to
assure
him
that
I
should
come
to
the
funeral
,
I
pass
the
intermediate
day
in
the
curious
state
of
mind
I
have
glance
at
.
<EOS>
I
go
down
early
in
the
morning
,
and
alight
at
the
Blue
Boar
in
good
time
to
walk
over
to
the
forge
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
fine
summer
weather
again
,
and
,
as
I
walk
along
,
the
time
when
I
be
a
little
helpless
creature
,
and
my
sister
do
not
spare
me
,
vividly
return
.
<EOS>
but
they
return
with
a
gentle
tone
upon
them
that
soften
even
the
edge
of
Tickler
.
<EOS>
for
now
,
the
very
breath
of
the
bean
and
clover
whisper
to
my
heart
that
the
day
must
come
when
it
would
be
well
for
my
memory
that
other
walk
in
the
sunshine
should
be
soften
as
they
think
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
I
come
within
sight
of
the
house
,
and
see
that
Trabb
and
Co.
have
put
in
a
funereal
execution
and
take
possession
.
<EOS>
two
dismally
absurd
person
,
each
ostentatiously
exhibit
a
crutch
do
up
in
a
black
bandage
---
as
if
that
instrument
could
possibly
communicate
any
comfort
to
anybody
---
be
post
at
the
front
door
;
and
in
one
of
them
I
recognize
a
postboy
discharge
from
the
Boar
for
turn
a
young
couple
into
a
sawpit
on
their
bridal
morning
,
in
consequence
of
intoxication
render
it
necessary
for
him
to
ride
his
horse
<EOS>
clasp
round
the
neck
with
both
arm
.
<EOS>
all
the
child
of
the
village
,
and
most
of
the
woman
,
be
admire
these
sable
warder
and
the
close
window
of
the
house
and
forge
;
and
as
I
come
up
,
one
of
the
two
warder
(
the
postboy
)
knock
at
the
door
---
imply
that
I
be
far
too
much
exhaust
by
grief
,
to
have
strength
remain
to
knock
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>
another
sable
warder
(
a
carpenter
,
who
have
once
eat
two
goose
for
a
wager
)
open
the
door
,
and
show
me
into
the
good
parlour
.
<EOS>
here
,
Mr
Trabb
have
take
unto
himself
the
good
table
,
and
have
get
all
the
leave
up
,
and
be
hold
a
kind
of
black
bazaar
,
with
the
aid
of
a
quantity
of
black
pin
.
<EOS>
at
the
moment
of
my
arrival
,
he
have
just
finish
put
somebody
's
hat
into
black
long
-
clothe
,
like
an
african
baby
;
so
he
hold
out
his
hand
for
mine
.
<EOS>
but
I
,
mislead
by
the
action
,
and
confuse
by
the
occasion
,
shake
hand
with
him
with
every
testimony
of
warm
affection
.
  
<EOS>
poor
dear
Joe
,
entangle
in
a
little
black
cloak
tie
in
a
large
bow
under
his
chin
,
be
seat
apart
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
;
where
,
as
chief
mourner
,
he
have
evidently
be
station
by
Trabb
.
<EOS>
when
I
bend
down
and
say
to
him
,
"
Dear
Joe

how

you

"
<EOS>
he
say
,
"

no

<EOS>
Biddy
,
look
very
neat
and
modest
in
her
black
dress
,
go
quietly
here
and
there
,
and
be
very
helpful
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
speak
to
Biddy
as
I
think
it
not
a
time
for
talk
<EOS>
I
go
and
sit
down
near
Joe
,
and
there
begin
to
wonder
in
what
part
of
the
house
it
<EOS>
---
she
---
my
sister
---
be
.
<EOS>
the
air
of
the
parlour
be
faint
with
the
smell
of
sweet
cake
,
I
look
about
for
the
table
of
refreshment
;
it
be
scarcely
visible
until
one
have
get
accustom
to
the
gloom
,
but
there
be
a
cut
-
up
plum
-
cake
upon
it
,
and
there
be
cut
-
up
orange
,
and
sandwich
,
and
biscuit
,
and
two
decanter
that
I
know
very
well
as
ornament
,
but
have
never
see
use
in
all
my
life
;
one
full
of
port
,
and
one
of
sherry
.
<EOS>
stand
at
this
table
,
I
become
conscious
of
the
servile
Pumblechook
in
a
black
cloak
and
several
yard
of
hatband
,
who
be
alternately
stuff
himself
,
and
make
obsequious
movement
to
catch
my
attention
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
he
succeed
,
he
come
over
to
me
(
breathe
sherry
and
crumb
)
,
and
say
in
a
subdue
voice
,
"
May
I
,
dear
sir
?
"
and
do
.
<EOS>
I
then
descry
Mr
and
Mrs
Hubble
;
the
last
-
name
in
a
decent
speechless
paroxysm
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
go
to
"
follow
,
"
and
be
all
in
course
of
be
tie
up
separately
(
by
Trabb
)
into
ridiculous
bundle
.
  
<EOS>
"
which
I
meantersay

Pip
,

Joe
whisper
me
,
as
we
be
be
what
Mr
Trabb
call
"
form
"
in
the
parlour
,
two
and
two
---
and
it
be
dreadfully
like
a
preparation
for
some
grim
kind
of
dance
;
"
which
I
meantersay
,
sir
,
as
I
would
in
preference
have
carry
her

along
with
three
or
four
friendly

<EOS>
wot
come
to
it
with
willing

and

but
it
be

wot
the

would
look
down
on
such

would
be
of

it

<EOS>

cry
Mr

at
this
point

in
a
depressed
business

like
voice
.
"
<EOS>
pocket

<EOS>
We
be
ready

"
  
<EOS>
so
,
we
all
put
our
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
to
our
face
,
as
if
our
nose
be
bleed
,
and
file
out
two
and
two
;
Joe
and
I
;
Biddy
and
Pumblechook
;
Mr
and
Mrs
Hubble
.
<EOS>
the
remain
of
my
poor
sister
have
be
bring
round
by
the
kitchen
door
,
and
,
it
be
a
point
of
Undertaking
ceremony
that
the
six
bearer
must
be
stifle
and
blind
under
a
horrible
black
velvet
housing
with
a
white
border
,
the
whole
look
like
a
blind
monster
with
twelve
human
leg
,
shuffling
and
blunder
along
,
under
the
guidance
of
two
keeper
---
the
postboy
and
his
comrade
.
  
<EOS>
the
neighbourhood
,
however
,
highly
approve
of
these
arrangement
,
and
we
be
much
admire
as
we
go
through
the
village
;
the
more
youthful
and
vigorous
part
of
the
community
make
dash
now
and
then
to
cut
us
off
,
and
lie
in
wait
to
intercept
us
at
point
of
vantage
.
<EOS>
at
such
time
the
more
exuberant
among
them
call
out
in
an
excited
manner
on
our
emergence
round
some
corner
of
expectancy
,
"
\
<EOS>
here
\
 
they
come
!
"
<EOS>
"
\
<EOS>
here
\
 
they
be
!
"
<EOS>
and
we
be
all
but
cheer
.
<EOS>
in
this
progress
I
be
much
annoy
by
the
abject
Pumblechook
,
who
,
be
behind
me
,
persist
all
the
way
as
a
delicate
attention
in
arrange
my
streaming
hatband
,
and
smooth
my
cloak
.
<EOS>
My
thought
be
further
distract
by
the
excessive
pride
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Hubble
,
who
be
surpassingly
conceited
and
vainglorious
in
be
member
of
so
distinguish
a
procession
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
the
range
of
marsh
lie
clear
before
us
,
with
the
sail
of
the
ship
on
the
river
grow
out
of
it
;
and
we
go
into
the
churchyard
,
close
to
the
grave
of
my
unknown
parent
,
Philip
Pirrip
,
late
of
this
parish
,
and
also
Georgiana
,
Wife
of
the
Above
.
<EOS>
and
there
,
my
sister
be
lay
quietly
in
the
earth
while
the
lark
sing
high
above
it
,
and
the
light
wind
strew
it
with
beautiful
shadow
of
cloud
and
tree
.
  
<EOS>
of
the
conduct
of
the
worldly
-
minded
Pumblechook
while
this
be
do
,
I
desire
to
say
no
more
than
it
be
all
address
to
me
;
and
that
even
when
those
noble
passage
be
read
which
remind
humanity
how
it
bring
nothing
into
the
world
and
can
take
nothing
out
,
and
how
it
fleeth
like
a
shadow
and
never
continueth
long
in
one
stay
<EOS>
,
I
hear
him
cough
a
reservation
of
the
case
of
a
young
gentleman
who
come
unexpectedly
into
large
property
.
<EOS>
when
we
get
back
,
he
have
the
hardihood
to
tell
me
that
he
wish
my
sister
could
have
know
I
have
do
her
so
much
honour
,
and
to
hint
that
she
would
have
consider
it
reasonably
purchase
at
the
price
of
her
death
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
he
drink
all
the
rest
of
the
sherry
,
and
Mr
Hubble
drink
the
port
,
and
the
two
talk
(
which
I
have
since
observe
to
be
customary
in
such
case
)
as
if
they
be
of
quite
another
race
from
the
deceased
,
and
be
notoriously
immortal
.
<EOS>
finally
,
he
go
away
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Hubble
---
to
make
an
evening
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
feel
sure
,
and
to
tell
the
Jolly
Bargemen
that
he
be
the
founder
of
my
fortune
and
my
early
benefactor
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
be
all
go
,
and
when
Trabb
and
his
man
---
but
not
his
boy
:
I
look
for
him
---
have
cram
their
mummery
into
bag
,
and
be
go
too
,
the
house
feel
wholesomer
.
<EOS>
soon
afterwards
,
Biddy
,
Joe
,
and
I
,
have
a
cold
dinner
together
;
but
we
dine
in
the
good
parlour
,
not
in
the
old
kitchen
,
and
Joe
be
so
exceedingly
particular
what
he
do
with
his
knife
and
fork
and
the
salt
-
cellar
and
what
not
,
that
there
be
great
restraint
upon
us
.
<EOS>
but
after
dinner
,
when
I
make
him
take
his
pipe
,
and
when
I
have
loiter
with
him
about
the
forge
,
and
when
we
sit
down
together
on
the
great
block
of
stone
outside
it
,
we
get
on
well
.
<EOS>
I
notice
that
after
the
funeral
Joe
change
his
clothe
so
far
,
as
to
make
a
compromise
between
his
Sunday
dress
and
working
dress
:
in
which
the
dear
fellow
look
natural
,
and
like
the
man
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
very
much
pleased
by
my
asking
if
I
may
sleep
in
my
own
little
room
,
and
I
be
pleased
too
;
for
,
I
feel
that
I
have
do
rather
a
great
thing
in
make
the
request
.
<EOS>
when
the
shadow
of
evening
be
close
in
,
I
take
an
opportunity
of
get
into
the
garden
with
Biddy
for
a
little
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
think
you
may
have

<EOS>
She
be
so
quiet

and
have
such
an
orderly

good

and
pretty
way
with
her
,
that
I
do
not
like
the
thought
of
make
her
cry
again
.
<EOS>
after
look
a
little
at
her
downcast
eye
as
she
walk
beside
me
,
I
give
up
that
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
will
be
difficult
for
you
to
remain
here
now
,
Biddy
dear

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
I
can
not
do
so

Mr
Pip

say
Biddy
,
in
a
tone
of
regret
,
but
still
of
quiet
conviction
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
speak
to
Mrs
Hubble

and
I

I
will
tell

Biddy

with
a
smile

raise

improve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
always
improve
,
Biddy
,
under
any
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
except
in
my
bad
side
of
human
nature
,
"
murmur
Biddy
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
much
a
reproach
,
as
an
irresistible
thinking
aloud
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
would
give
up
that
point
too
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
walk
a
little
further
with
Biddy
,
look
silently
at
her
downcast
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
hear
the
particular
of
my
sister
's
death
,
Biddy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
very
slight
,
poor
thing
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
in
one
of
her
bad
state
---
though
they
have
get
better
of
late
,
rather
than
bad
---
for
four
day
,
when
she
come
out
of
it
in
the
evening
,
just
at
tea
-
time
,
and
say
quite
plainly
,
"
Joe
.
"
<EOS>
as
she
have
never
say
any
word
for
a
long
while
,
I
run
and
fetch
in
Mr
Gargery
from
the
forge
.
<EOS>
She
make
sign
to
me
that
she
want
him
to
sit
down
close
to
her
,
and
want
me
to
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
so
I
put
them
round
his
neck
,
and
she
lay
her
head
down
on
his
shoulder
quite
content
and
satisfied
.
<EOS>
and
so
she
presently
say
"
<EOS>
Joe
"
again
,
and
once
"
Pardon
,
"
and
once
"
Pip
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
she
never
lift
her
head
up
any
more
,
and
it
be
just
an
hour
later
when
we
lay
it
down
on
her
own
bed
,
because
we
find
she
be
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Biddy
cry
;
the
darkening
garden
,
and
the
lane
,
and
the
star
that
be
come
out
,
be
blur
in
my
own
sight
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
be
ever
discover
,
Biddy
?
"
  
"
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
what
be
become
of
Orlick
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
from
the
colour
of
his
clothe
that
he
be
work
in
the
quarry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
have
see
him
then
?
<EOS>
---
why
be
you
look
at
that
dark
tree
in
the
lane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
there
,
on
the
night
she
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
the
last
time
either
,
Biddy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
have
see
him
there
,
since
we
have
be
walk
here
.
<EOS>
---
It
be
of
no
use
,
"
say
Biddy
,
lay
her
hand
upon
my
arm
,
as
I
be
for
run
out
,
"
you
know
I
would
not
deceive
you
;
he
be
not
there
a
minute
,
and
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
revive
my
utmost
indignation
to
find
that
she
be
still
pursue
by
this
fellow
,
and
I
feel
inveterate
against
him
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
so
,
and
tell
her
that
I
would
spend
any
money
or
take
any
pain
to
drive
him
out
of
that
country
.
<EOS>
by
degree
she
lead
me
into
more
temperate
talk
,
and
she
tell
me
how
Joe
love
me
,
and
how
Joe
never
complain
of
anything
---
she
do
not
say
,
of
me
;
she
have
no
need
;
I
know
what
she
mean
---
but
ever
do
his
duty
in
his
way
of
life
,
with
a
strong
hand
,
a
quiet
tongue
,
and
a
gentle
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
it
would
be
hard
to
say
too
much
for
him
,
"
say
I
;
"
and
Biddy
,
we
must
often
speak
of
these
thing
,
<EOS>
for
of
course
I
shall
be
often
down
here
now
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
leave
poor
Joe
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
Biddy
say
never
a
single
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Biddy
,
do
not
you
hear
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Mr
Pip
.
"
  
"
not
to
mention
your
call
me
Mr
Pip
---
which
appear
to
me
to
be
in
bad
taste
,
Biddy
---
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
mean
?
"
ask
Biddy
,
timidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
in
a
virtuously
self
-
assert
manner
,
"
I
must
request
to
know
what
you
mean
by
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
by
this
?
"
say
Biddy
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
do
not

I
retort
.
<EOS>
"
You
use
not

echo
,
Biddy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

use
not

Biddy
.
"
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
Mr
Pip
!
<EOS>
use
!
"
  
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
rather
think
I
would
give
up
that
point
too
.
<EOS>
after
another
silent
turn
in
the
garden
,
I
fall
back
on
the
main
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
make
a
remark
respect
my
come
down
here
often
,
to
see
Joe
,
which
you
receive
with
a
marked
silence

<EOS>
have
the
goodness
,
Biddy
,
to
tell
me
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
quite
sure
,
then
,
that
you
WILL
come
to
see
him
often

"
ask
Biddy
,
stop
in
the
narrow
garden
walk
,
and
look
at
me
under
the
star
with
a
clear
and
honest
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
me
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
as
if
I
find
myself
compel
to
give
up
Biddy
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"
this
really
be
a
very
bad
side
of
human
nature
!
<EOS>
do
not
say
any
more
,
if
you
please
,
Biddy
.
<EOS>
this
shock
me
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
which
cogent
reason
I
keep
Biddy
at
a
distance
during
supper
,
and
,
when
I
go
up
to
my
own
old
little
room
,
take
as
stately
a
leave
of
her
as
I
could
,
in
my
murmuring
soul
,
deem
reconcilable
with
the
churchyard
and
the
event
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
as
often
as
I
be
restless
in
the
night
,
and
that
be
every
quarter
of
an
hour
,
I
reflect
what
an
unkindness
,
what
an
injury
,
what
an
injustice
,
Biddy
have
do
me
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
,
I
be
to
go
.
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
,
I
be
out
,
and
look
in
,
unseen
,
at
one
of
the
wooden
window
of
the
forge
.
<EOS>
there
I
stand
,
for
minute
,
look
at
Joe
,
already
at
work
with
a
glow
of
health
and
strength
upon
his
face
that
make
it
show
as
if
the
bright
sun
of
the
life
in
store
for
him
be
shine
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
bye
,
dear
Joe
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
no
,
do
not
wipe
it
off

for
God
's

give
me
your
blacken
hand

I
shall
be
down
soon

often

"
  
<EOS>
"
never
too
soon

Joe
,
"
and
never
too
often

<EOS>
Biddy
be
wait
for
me
at
the
kitchen
door
,
with
a
mug
of
new
milk
and
a
crust
of
bread
.

"
Biddy
,
"
say
I
,
when
I
give
her
my
hand
at
parting
,
"
I
be
not
angry
,
but
I
be
hurt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
do
not
be
hurt

"
she
plead
quite
pathetically
;
"
let
only
me
be
hurt
,
if
I
have
be
ungenerous
.
"
  
<EOS>
once
more
,
the
mist
be
rise
as
I
walk
away
.
<EOS>
if
they
disclose
to
me
,
as
I
suspect
they
do
,
that
I
should
not
come
back
,
and
that
Biddy
be
quite
right

all
I
can
say
be
---
they

quite
right

HERBERT
<EOS>
and
I
go
on
from
bad
to
bad
,
in
the
way
of
increase
our
debt
,
look
into
our
affair
,
leave
margin
,
and
the
like
exemplary
transaction
;
and
Time
go
on
,
whether
or
no
,
as
he
have
a
way
of
do
;
and
I
come
of
age
---
in
fulfilment
of
Herbert
's
prediction
,
that
I
should
do
so
before
I
know
where
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
Herbert
himself
have
come
of
age
,
eight
month
before
me
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
nothing
else
than
his
majority
to
come
into
,
the
event
do
not
make
a
profound
sensation
in
Barnard
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
look
forward
to
my
one
-
and
-
twentieth
birthday
,
with
a
crowd
of
speculation
and
anticipation
,
for
we
have
both
consider
that
my
guardian
could
hardly
help
say
something
definite
on
that
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
take
care
to
have
it
well
understand
in
Little
Britain
,
when
my
birthday
be
.
<EOS>
on
the
day
before
it
,
I
receive
an
official
note
from
Wemmick
,
inform
me
that
Mr
Jaggers
would
be
glad
if
I
would
call
upon
him
at
five
in
the
afternoon
of
the
auspicious
day
.
<EOS>
this
convince
us
that
something
great
be
to
happen
,
and
throw
me
into
an
unusual
flutter
when
I
repair
to
my
guardian
's
office
,
a
model
of
punctuality
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
outer
office
Wemmick
offer
me
his
congratulation
,
and
incidentally
rub
the
side
of
his
nose
with
a
fold
piece
of
tissue
-
paper
that
I
like
the
look
of
.
<EOS>
but
he
say
nothing
respect
it
,
and
motion
me
with
a
nod
into
my
guardian
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
November
,
and
my
guardian
be
stand
before
his
fire
lean
his
back
against
the
chimney
-
piece
,
with
his
hand
under
his
coat
-
tail
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Pip
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
must
call
you
Mr
Pip
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
congratulation
,
Mr
Pip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
shake
hand
---
he
be
always
a
remarkably
short
shaker
---
and
I
thank
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
a
chair
,
Mr
Pip
,
"
say
my
guardian
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
sit
down
,
and
he
preserve
his
attitude
and
bend
his
brow
at
his
boot
,
I
feel
at
a
disadvantage
,
which
remind
me
of
that
old
time
when
I
have
be
put
upon
a
tombstone
.
<EOS>
the
two
ghastly
cast
on
the
shelf
be
not
far
from
him
,
and
their
expression
be
as
if
they
be
make
a
stupid
apoplectic
attempt
to
attend
to
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
my
young
friend
,
"
my
guardian
begin
,
as
if
I
be
a
witness
in
the
box
,
"
I
be
go
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
suppose
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
bend
forward
to
look
at
the
ground
,
and
then
throw
his
head
back
to
look
at
the
ceiling
,
"
what
do
you
suppose
you
be
live
at
the
rate
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
the
rate
of

sir

"
at
"
repeat
Mr
Jaggers
,
still
look
at
the
ceiling
,
"
the
---
rate
---
of
?
"
and
then
look
all
round
the
room
,
and
pause
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
in
his
hand
,
half
way
to
his
nose
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
look
into
my
affair
so
often
,
that
I
have
thoroughly
destroy
any
slight
notion
I
may
ever
have
have
of
their
bearing
.
<EOS>
reluctantly
,
I
confess
myself
quite
unable
to
answer
the
question
.
<EOS>
this
reply
seem
agreeable
to
Mr
Jaggers
,
who
say
,
"
I
think
so
!
"
and
blow
his
nose
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
I
have
ask
 
\
<EOS>
you

<EOS>
a
question

it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
me
to
ask
you
several
question

I
remember
your
prohibition

ask

a

Mr

,

and
ask
another

<EOS>
I
look
about
me
,
but
there
appear
to
be
now
no
possible
escape
from
the
inquiry
,
"
have

<EOS>
I
---
anything
to

<EOS>
on
that
,
Mr
Jaggers
say
,
triumphantly
,
"
I
think
we
should
come
to
it
!
"
and
call
to
Wemmick
to
give
him
that
piece
of
paper
.
<EOS>
Wemmick
appear
,
hand
it
in
,
and
disappear

cry
Mr

wave
his
forefinger
to
stop
me
,
as
I
make
a
show
of
protest
:

.
<EOS>
and
a
very
handsome
sum
of
money
too
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
You
consider
it
so
?
  
<EOS>
"
how
could
I
do
otherwise
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
but
answer
the
question
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
.
  
<EOS>
"
undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
consider
it
,
undoubtedly
,
a
handsome
sum
of
money
.
<EOS>
now
,
that
handsome
sum
of
money
,
Pip
,
be
your
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
present
to
you
on
this
day
,
in
earnest
of
your
expectation
.
<EOS>
and
at
the
rate
of
that
handsome
sum
of
money
per
annum
,
and
at
no
high
rate
,
you
be
to
live
until
the
donor
of
the
whole
appear
.
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
you
will
now
take
your
money
affair
entirely
into
your
own
hand
,
and
you
will
draw
from
Wemmick
one
hundred
and
twenty
-
five
pound
per
quarter
,
until
you
be
in
communication
with
the
fountain
-
head
,
and
no
longer
with
the
mere
agent
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
tell
you
before
,
I
be
the
mere
agent
.
<EOS>
I
execute
my
instruction
,
and
I
be
pay
for
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
think
them
injudicious
,
but
I
be
not
pay
for
give
any
opinion
on
their
merit
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
begin
to
express
my
gratitude
to
my
benefactor
for
the
great
liberality
with
which
I
be
treat
,
when
Mr
Jaggers
stop
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
pay
;
Pip
,
"
say
he
,
coolly
,
"
to
carry
your
word
to
any
one
;
"
and
then
gather
up
his
coat
-
tail
,
as
he
have
gather
up
the
subject
,
and
stand
frown
at
his
boot
as
if
he
suspect
them
of
design
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
pause
,
I
hint
:
  
"
there
be
a
question
just
now
,
Mr
Jaggers
,
which
you
desire
me
to
waive
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
be
do
nothing
wrong
in
ask
it
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
have
know
that
he
would
never
help
me
out
;
but
it
take
me
aback
to
have
to
shape
the
question
afresh
,
as
if
it
be
quite
new
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
it
likely
,
"
I
say
,
after
hesitating
,
"
that
my
patron
,
the
fountain
-
head
you
have
speak
of
,
Mr
Jaggers
,
will
soon
---
"
there
I
delicately
stop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
soon
what
?
"
ask
Mr
Jaggers
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
no
question
as
it
stand
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
soon
come
to
London
,
"
say
I
,
after
cast
about
for
a
precise
form
of
word
,
"
or
summon
me
anywhere
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
now
here
,
"
reply
Mr
Jaggers
,
fix
me
for
the
first
time
with
his
dark
deep
-
set
eye
,
"
we
must
revert
to
the
evening
when
we
first
encounter
one
another
in
your
village
.
<EOS>
what
do
I
tell
you
then
,
Pip
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
tell
me
,
Mr
Jaggers
,
that
it
may
be
year
hence
when
that
person
appear
.
"
  
"
just
so
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
;
"
that
be
my
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
we
look
full
at
one
another
,
I
feel
my
breath
come
quicker
in
my
strong
desire
to
get
something
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
and
as
I
feel
that
it
come
quicker
,
and
as
I
feel
that
he
see
that
it
come
quicker
,
I
feel
that
I
have
less
chance
than
ever
of
get
anything
out
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
suppose
it
will
still
be
year
hence
,
Mr
Jaggers
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
shake
his
head
---
not
in
negative
the
question
,
but
in
altogether
negative
the
notion
that
he
could
anyhow
be
get
to
answer
it
---
and
the
two
horrible
cast
of
the
twitch
face
look
,
when
my
eye
stray
up
to
them
,
as
if
they
have
come
to
a
crisis
in
their
suspend
attention
,
and
be
go
to
sneeze
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
!
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
warm
the
back
of
his
leg
with
the
back
of
his
warmed
hand
,
"
I
will
be
plain
with
you
,
my
friend
Pip
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
question
I
must
not
be
ask
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
that
,
well
,
when
I
tell
you
it
be
a
question
that
may
compromise
 
\
me
.
<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
come
!
<EOS>
I
will
go
a
little
further
with
you
;
I
will
say
something
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
bend
down
so
low
to
frown
at
his
boot
,
that
he
be
able
to
rub
the
calf
of
his
leg
in
the
pause
he
make
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
that
person
disclose
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
straighten
himself
,
"
you
and
that
person
will
settle
your
own
affair
.
<EOS>
when
that
person
disclose
,
my
part
in
this
business
will
cease
and
determine
.
<EOS>
when
that
person
disclose
,
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
know
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
and
that
be
all
I
have
get
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
look
at
one
another
until
I
withdraw
my
eye
,
and
look
thoughtfully
at
the
floor
.
<EOS>
from
this
last
speech
I
derive
the
notion
that
Miss
Havisham
,
for
some
reason
or
no
reason
,
have
not
take
him
into
her
confidence
as
to
her
design
me
for
Estella
;
that
he
resent
this
,
and
feel
a
jealousy
about
it
;
or
that
he
really
do
object
to
that
scheme
,
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
man
<EOS>
I
raise
my
eye
again
<EOS>
,
I
find
that
he
have
be
shrewdly
look
at
me
all
the
time
,
and
be
do
so
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
all
you
have
to
say
,
sir
,
"
I
remark
,
"
there
can
be
nothing
leave
for
me
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
nod
assent
,
and
pull
out
his
thief
-
dread
watch
,
and
ask
me
where
I
be
go
to
dine
?
<EOS>
I
reply
at
my
own
chamber
,
with
Herbert
.
<EOS>
as
a
necessary
sequence
,
I
ask
him
if
he
would
favour
us
with
his
company
,
and
he
promptly
accept
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
but
he
insist
on
walk
home
with
me
,
in
order
that
I
may
make
no
extra
preparation
for
him
,
and
first
he
have
a
letter
or
two
to
write
,
and
(
of
course
)
have
his
hand
to
wash
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
say
I
would
go
into
the
outer
office
and
talk
to
Wemmick
.
  
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
when
the
five
hundred
pound
have
come
into
my
pocket
,
a
thought
have
come
into
my
head
which
have
be
often
there
before
;
and
it
appear
to
me
that
Wemmick
be
a
good
person
to
advise
with
,
concern
such
thought
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
already
lock
up
his
safe
,
and
make
preparation
for
go
home
.
<EOS>
He
have
leave
his
desk
,
bring
out
his
two
greasy
office
candlestick
and
stand
them
in
line
with
the
snuffer
on
a
slab
near
the
door
,
ready
to
be
extinguish
;
he
have
rake
his
fire
low
,
put
his
hat
and
great
-
coat
ready
,
and
be
beat
himself
all
over
the
chest
with
his
safe
-
key
,
as
an
athletic
exercise
after
business
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Wemmick
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
want
to
ask
your
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
desirous
to
serve
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Wemmick
tighten
his
post
-
office
and
shake
his
head
,
as
if
his
opinion
be
dead
against
any
fatal
weakness
of
that
sort
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
friend
,
"
I
pursue
,
"
be
try
to
get
on
in
commercial
life
,
but
have
no
money
,
and
find
it
difficult
and
dishearten
to
make
a
beginning
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
want
somehow
to
help
him
to
a
beginning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
with
money
down
?
"
say
Wemmick
,
in
a
tone
drier
than
any
sawdust
.
  
<EOS>
"
with
 
\
some
\
 
money
down
,
"
I
reply
,
for
an
uneasy
remembrance
shoot
across
me
of
that
symmetrical
bundle
of
paper
at
home
;
"
with
 
\
<EOS>
some
\
 
<EOS>
money
down
,
and
perhaps
some
anticipation
of
my
expectation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pip
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
I
should
like
just
to
run
over
with
you
on
my
finger
,
if
you
please
,
the
name
of
the
various
bridge
up
as
high
as
Chelsea
Reach
.
<EOS>
let
's
see
;
there
be
London
,
one
;
Southwark
,
two
;
Blackfriars
,
three
;
Waterloo
,
four
;
westminster
,
five
;
Vauxhall
,
six
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
check
off
each
bridge
in
its
turn
,
with
the
handle
of
his
safe
-
key
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
as
many
as
six
,
you
see
,
to
choose
from
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
,
"
say
<EOS>
I.
  
"
choose
your
bridge
,
Mr
Pip
,
"
return
Wemmick
,
"
and
take
a
walk
upon
your
bridge
,
and
pitch
your
money
into
the
Thames
over
the
centre
arch
of
your
bridge
,
and
you
know
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
serve
a
friend
with
it
,
and
you
may
know
the
end
of
it
too
---
but
it
be
a
less
pleasant
and
profitable
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
have
post
a
newspaper
in
his
mouth
,
he
make
it
so
wide
after
say
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
discouraging
,
"
say
I.
  
"
<EOS>
mean
to
be
so
,
"
say
Wemmick
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
be
it
your
opinion
,
"
I
inquire
,
with
some
little
indignation
,
"
that
a
man
should
never
---
"
  
"
---
invest
portable
property
in
a
friend
?
"
say
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
certainly
he
should
not
.
<EOS>
unless
he
want
to
get
rid
of
the
friend
---
and
then
it
become
a
question
how
much
portable
property
it
may
be
worth
to
get
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
that
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
your
deliberate
opinion
,
Mr
Wemmick
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
"
he
return
,
"
be
my
deliberate
opinion
in
this
office
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
press
him
,
for
I
think
I
see
him
near
a
loophole
here
;
"
but
would
that
be
your
opinion
at
Walworth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pip
,
"
he
reply
,
with
gravity
,
"
walworth
be
one
place
,
and
this
office
be
another
.
<EOS>
much
as
the
aged
be
one
person
,
and
Mr
Jaggers
be
another
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
be
confound
together
.
<EOS>
My
Walworth
sentiment
must
be
take
at
walworth
;
none
but
my
official
sentiment
can
be
take
in
this
office
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
I
,
much
relieved
,
"
then
I
shall
look
you
up
at
Walworth
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pip
,
"
he
return
,
"
you
will
be
welcome
there
,
in
a
private
and
personal
capacity
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
have
hold
this
conversation
in
a
low
voice
,
well
know
my
guardian
's
ear
to
be
the
sharp
of
the
sharp
.
<EOS>
as
he
now
appear
in
his
doorway
,
towel
his
hand
,
Wemmick
get
on
his
great
-
coat
and
stand
by
to
snuff
out
the
candle
.
<EOS>
We
all
three
go
into
the
street
together
,
and
from
the
door
-
step
Wemmick
turn
his
way
,
and
Mr
Jaggers
and
I
turn
ours
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
wish
more
than
once
that
evening
,
that
Mr
Jaggers
have
have
an
Aged
in
Gerrard
-
street
,
or
a
Stinger
,
or
a
something
,
or
a
somebody
,
to
unbend
his
brow
a
little
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
uncomfortable
consideration
on
a
twenty
-
first
birthday
,
that
come
of
age
at
all
seem
hardly
worth
while
in
such
a
guarded
and
suspicious
world
as
he
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
thousand
time
better
inform
and
clever
than
Wemmick
,
and
yet
I
would
a
thousand
time
rather
have
have
Wemmick
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
and
Mr
Jaggers
make
not
me
alone
intensely
melancholy
,
because
,
after
he
be
go
,
Herbert
say
of
himself
,
with
his
eye
fix
on
the
fire
,
that
he
think
he
must
have
commit
a
felony
and
forget
the
detail
of
it
,
he
feel
so
dejected
and
guilty
.

chapter
37
 
deem
Sunday
the
good
day
for
take
Mr
Wemmick
's
Walworth
sentiment
<EOS>
,
I
devote
the
next
ensue
Sunday
afternoon
to
a
pilgrimage
to
the
Castle
.
<EOS>
on
arrive
before
the
battlement
,
I
find
the
Union
Jack
fly
and
the
drawbridge
up
;
but
undeterred
by
this
show
of
defiance
and
resistance
,
I
ring
at
the
gate
,
and
be
admit
in
a
most
pacific
manner
by
the
aged
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
son
,
sir
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
after
secure
the
drawbridge
,
"
rather
have
it
in
his
mind
that
you
may
happen
to
drop
in
,
and
he
leave
word
that
he
would
soon
be
home
from
his
afternoon
's
walk
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
regular
in
his
walk
,
be
my
son
.
<EOS>
very
regular
in
everything
,
be
my
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
nod
at
the
old
gentleman
as
Wemmick
himself
may
have
nod
,
and
we
go
in
and
sit
down
by
the
fireside
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
make
acquaintance
with
my
son
,
sir
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
in
his
chirp
way
,
while
he
warm
his
hand
at
the
blaze
,
"
at
his
office
,
I
expect
?
<EOS>
"
I
nod
.
"
<EOS>
hah
!
<EOS>
I
have
heerd
that
my
son
be
a
wonderful
hand
at
his
business
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
nod
hard
.
"
<EOS>
yes
;
so
they
tell
me
.
<EOS>
His
business
be
the
Law
?
<EOS>
"
I
nod
harder
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
which
make
it
more
surprising
in
my
son
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
"
for
he

"
  
<EOS>
curious
to
know
how
the
old
gentleman
stand
inform
concern
the
reputation
of
Mr
Jaggers
,
I
roar
that
name
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
throw
me
into
the
great
confusion
by
laugh
heartily
and
reply
in
a
very
sprightly
manner
,
"
no
,
to
be
sure
;
you
be
right
.
"
<EOS>
and
to
this
hour
I
have
not
the
faint
notion
what
he
mean
,
or
what
joke
he
think
I
have
make
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
could
not
sit
there
nod
at
him
perpetually
,
without
make
some
other
attempt
to
interest
him
,
I
shout
an
inquiry
whether
his
own
calling
in
life
have
be
"
the
Wine
-
Coopering
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
dint
of
straining
that
term
out
of
myself
several
time
and
tap
the
old
gentleman
on
the
chest
to
associate
it
with
him
,
I
at
last
succeed
in
make
my
meaning
understand
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
;
"
the
warehousing
,
the

<EOS>
first
,
over
yonder
;
"
he
appear
to
mean
up
the

,
but
I
believe
he
intend
to
refer
me
to
Liverpool
;
"
and
then
in
the
City
of
London
here
.
<EOS>
however
,
have
an
infirmity
---
for
I
be
hard
of
hearing
,
sir

"
  
<EOS>
I
express
in
pantomime
the
great
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
yes
,
hard
of
hearing
;
have
that
infirmity
come
upon
me
,
my
son

go
into

Law
,
and
he
take
charge
of
me

and
he
by
little
and
little
make
out
this
elegant
and
beautiful
property
.
<EOS>
but
return
to
what
you
say
,
you
know
,
"
pursue
the
old
man
,
again
laugh
heartily
,
"
what
I
say
be
,
no
to
be
sure
;
you
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
modestly
wonder
whether
my
utmost
ingenuity
would
have
enable
me
to
say
anything
that
would
have
amuse
him
half
as
much
as
this
imaginary
pleasantry
,
when
I
be
startle
by
a
sudden
click
in
the
wall
on
one
side
of
the
chimney
,
and
the
ghostly
tumble
open
of
a
little
wooden
flap
with
"
JOHN
"
upon
it
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
,
follow
my
eye
,
cry
with
great
triumph
,
"
My
son
's
come
home
!
"
<EOS>
and
we
both
go
out
to
the
drawbridge
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
worth
any
money
to
see
Wemmick
wave
a
salute
to
me
from
the
other
side
of
the
moat
,
when
we
may
have
shake
hand
across
it
with
the
great
ease
.
<EOS>
the
Aged
be
so
delighted
to
work
the
drawbridge
,
that
I
make
no
offer
to
assist
him
,
but
stand
quiet
until
Wemmick
have
come
across
,
and
have
present
me
to
Miss
Skiffins
:
a
lady
by
whom
he
be
accompany
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Skiffins
be
of
a
wooden
appearance
,
and
be
,
like
her
escort
,
in
the
post
-
office
branch
of
the
service
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
be
some
two
or
three
year
young
than
Wemmick
,
and
I
judge
her
to
stand
possess
of
portable
property
.
<EOS>
the
cut
of
her
dress
from
the
waist
upward
,
both
before
and
behind
,
make
her
figure
very
like
a
boy
's
kite
;
and
I
may
have
pronounce
her
gown
a
little
too
decidedly
orange
,
and
her
glove
a
little
too
intensely
green
.
<EOS>
but
she
seem
to
be
a
good
sort
of
fellow
,
and
show
a
high
regard
for
the
aged
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
long
in
discover
that
she
be
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
Castle
;
for
,
on
our
go
in
,
and
my
complimenting
Wemmick
on
his
ingenious
contrivance
for
announce
himself
to
the
aged
,
he
beg
me
to
give
my
attention
for
a
moment
to
the
other
side
of
the
chimney
,
and
disappear
.
<EOS>
presently
another
click
come
,
and
another
little
door
tumble
open
with
"
Miss
Skiffins
"
on
it
;
then
Miss
Skiffins
shut
up
and
John
tumble
open
;
then
Miss
Skiffins
and
John
both
tumble
open
together
,
and
finally
shut
up
together
.
<EOS>
on
Wemmick
's
return
from
work
these
mechanical
appliance
,
I
express
the
great
admiration
with
which
I
regard
them
,
and
he
say
,
"
well
,
you
know
,
they
be
both
pleasant
and
useful
to
the
aged
.
<EOS>
and
by
George
,
sir
,
it
be
a
thing
worth
mention
,
that
of
all
the
people
who
come
to
this
gate
,
the
secret
of
those
pull
be
only
know
to
the
aged
,
Miss
Skiffins
,
and
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
Mr
Wemmick
make
them
,
"
add
Miss
Skiffins
,
"
with
his
own
hand
out
of
his
own
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
while
Miss
Skiffins
be
take
off
her
bonnet
(
she
retain
her
green
glove
during
the
evening
as
an
outward
and
visible
sign
that
there
be
company
)
,
Wemmick
invite
me
to
take
a
walk
with
him
round
the
property
,
and
see
how
the
island
look
in
winter
-
time
.
<EOS>
think
that
he
do
this
to
give
me
an
opportunity
of
take
his
Walworth
sentiment
,
I
seize
the
opportunity
as
soon
as
we
be
out
of
the
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
have
think
of
the
matter
with
care
,
I
approach
my
subject
as
if
I
have
never
hint
at
it
before
.
<EOS>
I
inform
Wemmick
that
I
be
anxious
in
behalf
of
Herbert
Pocket
,
and
I
tell
him
how
we
have
first
meet
,
and
how
we
have
fight
.
<EOS>
I
glance
at
Herbert
's
home
,
and
at
his
character
,
and
at
his
have
no
mean
but
such
as
he
be
dependent
on
his
father
for
:
those
,
uncertain
and
unpunctual
.
<EOS>
I
allude
to
the
advantage
I
have
derive
in
my
first
rawness
and
ignorance
from
his
society
,
and
I
confess
that
I
fear
I
have
<EOS>
but
ill
repay
them
,
and
that
he
may
have
do
better
without
me
and
my
expectation
.
<EOS>
keep
Miss
Havisham
in
the
background
at
a
great
distance
,
I
still
hint
at
the
possibility
of
my
have
compete
with
him
in
his
prospect
,
and
at
the
certainty
of
his
possess
a
generous
soul
,
and
be
far
above
any
mean
distrust
,
retaliation
,
or
design
.
<EOS>
for
all
these
reason
(
I
tell
Wemmick
)
,
and
because
he
be
my
young
companion
and
friend
,
and
I
have
a
great
affection
for
him
,
I
wish
my
own
good
fortune
to
reflect
some
ray
upon
him
,
and
therefore
I
seek
advice
from
Wemmick
's
experience
and
knowledge
of
man
and
affair
<EOS>
,
how
I
could
best
try
with
my
resource
to
help
Herbert
to
some
present
income
---
say
of
a
hundred
a
year
,
to
keep
him
in
good
hope
and
heart
---
and
gradually
to
buy
him
on
to
some
small
partnership
.
<EOS>
I
beg
Wemmick
,
in
conclusion
,
to
understand
that
my
help
must
always
be
render
without
Herbert
's
knowledge
or
suspicion
,
and
that
there
be
no
one
else
in
the
world
with
whom
I
could
advise
.
<EOS>
I
wound
up
by
lay
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
say
,
"
I
can
not
help
confide
in
you
,
though
I
know
it
must
be
troublesome
to
you
;
but
that
be
your
fault
,
in
have
ever
bring
me
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wemmick
be
silent
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
say
with
a
kind
of
start
,
"
well
you
know
,
Mr
Pip
,
I
must
tell
you
one
thing
.
<EOS>
this
be
devilish
good
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
say
you
will
help
me
to
be
good
then
,
"
say
I.
  
"
ecod
,
"
reply
Wemmick
,
shake
his
head
,
"
that
be
not
my
trade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
be
this
your
trading
-
place
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
"
he
return
.
<EOS>
"
You
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pip
,
I
will
put
on
my
considering
-
cap
,
and
I
think
all
you
want
to
do
,
may
be
do
by
degree
.
<EOS>
Skiffins
(
that
be
her
brother
)
be
an
accountant
and
agent
.
<EOS>
I
will
look
him
up
and
go
to
work
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
ten
thousand
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
thank
you
,
for
though
we
be
strictly
in
our
private
and
personal
capacity
<EOS>
,
still
it
may
be
mention
that
there
 
\
be
\
 
Newgate
cobwebs
about
,
and
it
brush
them
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
after
a
little
further
conversation
to
the
same
effect
,
we
return
into
the
Castle
where
we
find
Miss
Skiffins
prepare
tea
.
<EOS>
the
responsible
duty
of
make
the
toast
be
delegate
to
the
aged
,
and
that
excellent
old
gentleman
be
so
intent
upon
it
that
he
seem
to
me
in
some
danger
of
melt
his
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
nominal
meal
that
we
be
go
to
make
,
but
a
vigorous
reality
.
<EOS>
the
aged
prepare
such
a
haystack
of
butter
toast
,
that
I
could
scarcely
see
him
over
it
as
it
simmer
on
an
iron
stand
hook
on
to
the
top
-
bar
;
while
Miss
Skiffins
brew
such
a
jorum
of
tea
,
that
the
pig
in
the
back
premise
become
strongly
excited
,
and
repeatedly
express
his
desire
to
participate
in
the
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
the
flag
have
be
strike
,
and
the
gun
have
be
fire
,
at
the
right
moment
of
time
,
and
I
feel
as
snugly
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
Walworth
as
if
the
moat
be
thirty
foot
wide
by
as
many
deep
.
<EOS>
nothing
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
the
Castle
,
but
the
occasional
tumbling
open
of
John
and
Miss
Skiffins
:
which
little
door
be
a
prey
to
some
spasmodic
infirmity
that
make
me
sympathetically
uncomfortable
until
I
get
use
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
infer
from
the
methodical
nature
of
Miss
Skiffins
's
arrangement
that
she
make
tea
there
every
Sunday
night
;
and
I
rather
suspect
that
a
classic
brooch
she
wear
,
represent
the
profile
of
an
undesirable
female
with
a
very
straight
nose
and
a
very
new
moon
,
be
a
piece
of
portable
property
that
have
be
give
her
by
Wemmick
.
  
<EOS>
We
eat
the
whole
of
the
toast
,
and
drink
tea
in
proportion
,
and
it
be
delightful
to
see
how
warn
and
greasy
we
all
get
after
it
.
<EOS>
the
aged
especially
,
may
have
pass
for
some
clean
old
chief
of
a
savage
tribe
,
just
oil
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
of
repose
,
Miss
Skiffins
---
in
the
absence
of
the
little
servant
who
,
it
seem
,
retire
to
the
bosom
of
her
family
on
Sunday
afternoon
---
wash
up
the
tea
-
thing
,
in
a
trifle
lady
-
like
amateur
manner
that
compromise
none
of
us
.
<EOS>
then
,
she
put
on
her
glove
again
,
and
we
draw
round
the
fire
,
and
Wemmick
say
,
"
now
Aged
Parent
,
tip
us
the
paper
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wemmick
explain
to
me
while
the
Aged
get
his
spectacle
out
,
that
this
be
accord
to
custom
,
and
that
it
give
the
old
gentleman
infinite
satisfaction
to
read
the
news
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
offer
an
apology
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
for
he
be
not
capable
of
many
pleasure
<EOS>
---
be
you
,
Aged
P
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
John
,
all
right
,
"
return
the
old
man
see
himself
speak
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
tip
him
a
nod
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
when
he
look
off
his
paper
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
and
he
will
be
as
happy
as
a
king
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
attention
,
aged
One
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
John
,
all
right
!
"
return
the
cheerful
old
man
:
so
busy
and
so
pleased
,
that
it
really
be
quite
charming
.
  
<EOS>
the
Aged
's
reading
remind
me
of
the
class
at
Mr
Wopsle
's
great
-
aunt
's
,
with
the
pleasanter
peculiarity
that
it
seem
to
come
through
a
keyhole
.
<EOS>
as
he
want
the
candle
close
to
him
,
and
as
he
be
always
on
the
verge
of
put
either
his
head
or
the
newspaper
into
them
,
he
require
as
much
watch
as
a
powder
-
mill
.
<EOS>
but
Wemmick
be
equally
untiring
and
gentle
in
his
vigilance
,
and
the
aged
read
on
,
quite
unconscious
of
his
many
rescue
.
<EOS>
whenever
he
look
at
us
,
we
all
express
the
great
interest
and
amazement
,
and
nod
until
he
resume
again
.
  
<EOS>
as
Wemmick
and
Miss
Skiffins
sit
side
by
side
,
and
as
I
sit
in
a
shadowy
corner
,
I
observe
a
slow
and
gradual
elongation
of
Mr
Wemmick
's
mouth
,
powerfully
suggestive
of
his
slowly
and
gradually
steal
his
ann
round
Miss
Skiffins
's
waist
.
<EOS>
in
course
of
time
I
see
his
hand
appear
on
the
other
side
of
Miss
Skiffins
;
but
at
that
moment
Miss
Skiffins
neatly
stop
him
with
the
green
  
glove
,
unwound
his
arm
again
as
if
it
be
an
article
of
dress
,
and
with
the
great
deliberation
lay
it
on
the
table
before
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Skiffins
's
composure
while
she
do
this
be
one
of
the
most
remarkable
sight
I
have
ever
see
,
and
if
I
could
have
think
the
act
consistent
with
abstraction
of
mind
,
I
should
have
deem
that
Miss
Skiffins
perform
it
mechanically
.
  
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
,
I
notice
Wemmick
's
arm
begin
to
disappear
again
,
and
gradually
fade
out
of
view
.
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
,
his
mouth
begin
to
widen
again
.
<EOS>
after
an
interval
of
suspense
on
my
part
that
be
quite
enthral
and
almost
painful
,
I
see
his
hand
appear
on
the
other
side
of
Miss
Skiffins
.
<EOS>
instantly
,
Miss
Skiffins
stop
it
with
the
neatness
of
a
placid
boxer
,
take
off
that
girdle
or
cestus
as
before
,
and
lay
it
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
take
the
table
to
represent
the
path
of
virtue
,
I
be
justified
in
state
that
during
the
whole
time
of
the
Aged
's
reading
,
Wemmick
's
arm
be
stray
from
the
path
of
virtue
and
be
recall
to
it
by
Miss
Skiffins
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
the
Aged
read
himself
into
a
light
slumber
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
time
for
Wemmick
to
produce
a
little
kettle
,
a
tray
of
glass
,
and
a
black
bottle
with
a
porcelain
-
top
cork
,
represent
some
clerical
dignitary
of
a
rubicund
and
social
aspect
.
<EOS>
with
the
aid
of
these
appliance
we
all
have
something
warm
to
drink
:
include
the
Aged
,
who
be
soon
awake
again
.
<EOS>
Miss
Skiffins
mixed
,
and
I
observe
that
she
and
Wemmick
drink
out
of
one
glass
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
know
better
than
to
offer
to
see
Miss
Skiffins
home
,
and
under
the
circumstance
I
think
I
have
best
go
first
:
which
I
do
,
take
a
cordial
leave
of
the
aged
,
and
have
pass
a
pleasant
evening
.
  
<EOS>
before
a
week
be
out
,
I
receive
a
note
from
Wemmick
,
date
Walworth
,
state
that
he
hope
he
have
make
some
advance
in
that
matter
appertain
to
our
private
and
personal
capacity
,
and
that
he
would
be
glad
if
I
could
come
and
see
him
again
upon
it
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
go
out
to
Walworth
again
,
and
yet
again
,
and
yet
again
,
and
I
see
him
by
appointment
in
the
City
several
time
,
but
never
hold
any
communication
with
him
on
the
subject
in
or
near
Little
Britain
.
<EOS>
the
upshot
be
,
that
we
find
a
worthy
young
merchant
or
shipping
-
broker
,
not
long
establish
in
business
,
who
want
intelligent
help
,
and
who
want
capital
,
and
who
in
due
course
of
time
and
receipt
would
want
a
partner
.
<EOS>
between
him
and
me
,
secret
article
be
sign
of
which
Herbert
be
the
subject
,
and
I
pay
him
half
of
my
five
hundred
pound
down
,
and
engage
for
sundry
other
payment
:
some
,
to
fall
due
at
certain
date
out
of
my
income
<EOS>
:
some
,
contingent
on
my
coming
into
my
property
.
<EOS>
Miss
Skiffins
's
brother
conduct
the
negotiation
.
<EOS>
Wemmick
pervade
it
throughout
,
but
never
appear
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
business
be
so
cleverly
manage
,
that
Herbert
have
not
the
least
suspicion
of
my
hand
be
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
the
radiant
face
with
which
he
come
home
one
afternoon
,
and
tell
me
,
as
a
mighty
piece
of
news
,
of
his
have
fall
in
with
one
Clarriker
(
the
young
merchant
's
name
)
,
and
of
Clarriker
's
have
show
an
extraordinary
inclination
towards
him
,
and
of
his
belief
that
the
opening
have
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
day
by
day
as
his
hope
grow
strong
and
his
face
brighter
,
he
must
have
think
me
a
more
and
more
affectionate
friend
,
for
I
have
the
great
difficulty
in
restrain
my
tear
of
triumph
when
I
see
him
so
happy
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
thing
be
do
,
and
he
have
that
day
enter
  
Clarriker
's
House
,
and
he
have
talk
to
me
for
a
whole
evening
in
a
flush
of
pleasure
and
success
,
I
do
really
cry
in
good
earnest
when
I
go
to
bed
,
to
think
that
my
expectation
have
do
some
good
to
somebody
.
  
<EOS>
a
great
event
in
my
life
,
the
turning
point
of
my
life
,
now
open
on
my
view
.
<EOS>
but
,
before
I
proceed
to
narrate
it
,
and
before
I
pass
on
to
all
the
change
it
involve
,
I
must
give
one
chapter
to
Estella
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
much
to
give
to
the
theme
that
so
long
fill
my
heart
.
    
<EOS>
chapter

be
that
staid
old
house
near
the
Green
at
Richmond
should
ever
come
to
be
haunt
when
I
be
dead
,
it
will
be
haunt
,
surely
,
by
my
ghost
.
<EOS>
o
the
many
,
many
night
and
day
through
which
the
unquiet

that
house
when
Estella

<EOS>
let
my
body
be
where
it
would
,
my
spirit
be
always
wander
,
wander
,
wander
,
about
that
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
with
whom
Estella
be
place
,
Mrs
Brandley
by
name

be
a
widow
,
with
one
daughter
several
year
old
than
Estella
.
<EOS>
the
mother
look
young

and
the
daughter
look
old
;
the
mother
's
complexion
be
pink
,
and
the
daughter
's
be
yellow
;
the
mother
set
up
for
frivolity
,
and
the
daughter
for
theology
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
what
be
call
a
good
position
,
and
visit
,
and
be
visit
by
,
number
of
people
.
<EOS>
little
,
if
any
,
community
of
feel
subsist
between
them
and
Estella
,
but
the
understanding
be
establish
that
they
be
necessary
to
her
,
and
that
she
be
necessary
to
them
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Brandley
have
be
a
friend
of
Miss
Havisham
's
before
the
time
of
her
seclusion
.
  
<EOS>
in
Mrs
Brandley
's
house
and
out
of
Mrs
Brandley
's
house
,
I
suffer
every
kind
and
degree
of
torture
that
Estella
could
cause
me
.
<EOS>
the
nature
of
my
relation
with
her
,
which
place
me
on
term
of
familiarity
without
place
me
on
term
of
favour
,
conduce
to
my
distraction
.
<EOS>
She
make
use
of
me
to
tease
other
admirer
,
and
she
turn
the
very
familiarity
between
herself
and
me
,
to
the
account
of
put
a
constant
slight
on
my
devotion
to
her
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
her
secretary
,
steward
,
half
-
brother
,
poor
relation
---
if
I
have
be
a
young
brother
of
her
appoint
husband
---
I
could
not
have
seem
to
myself
,
further
from
my
hope
when
I
be
near
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
privilege
of
call
her
by
her
name
and
hear
her
call
me
by
mine
,
become
under
the
circumstance
an
aggravation
of
my
trial
;
and
while
I
think
it
likely
that
it
almost
madden
her
other
lover
,
I
know
too
certainly
that
it
almost
madden
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
admirer
without
end
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
my
jealousy
make
an
admirer
of
every
one
who
go
near
her
;
but
there
be
more
than
enough
of
them
without
that
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
her
often
at
Richmond
,
I
hear
of
her
often
in
town
,
and
I
use
often
to
take
her
and
the
Brandleys
on
the
water
;
there
be
pic
-
nic
,
fete
day
,
play
,
opera
,
concert
,
party
,
all
sort
of
pleasure
,
through
which
I
pursue
her
---
and
they
be
all
misery
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
never
have
one
hour
's
happiness
in
her
society
,
and
yet
my
mind
all
round
<EOS>
the
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
be
harp
on
the
happiness
of
have
her
with
me
unto
death
.
  
<EOS>
throughout
this
part
of
our
intercourse
---
and
it
last
,
as
will
presently
be
see
,
for
what
I
then
think
a
long
time
<EOS>
---
she
habitually
revert
to
that
tone
which
express
that
our
association
be
force
upon
us
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
time
when
she
would
come
to
a
sudden
check
in
this
tone
and
in
all
her
many
tone
,
and
would
seem
to
pity
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pip
,
Pip
,
"
she
say
one
evening
,
come
to
such
a
check
,
when
we
sit
apart
at
a
darken
window
of
the
house
in
Richmond
;
"
will
you
never
take
warning
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
of
what
?
"
  
"
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
warn
not
to
be
attract
by
you
,
do
you
mean
,
Estella
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
mean
!
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
know
what
I
mean
,
you
be
blind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
reply
that
Love
be
commonly
repute
blind
,
but
for
the
reason
that
I
always
be
restrain
---
and
this
be
not
the
least
of
my
misery
---
by
a
feeling
that
it
be
ungenerous
to
press
myself
upon
her
,
when
she
know
that
she
could
not
choose
but
obey
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
My
dread
always
be
,
that
this
knowledge
on
her
part
lay
me
under
a
heavy
disadvantage
with
her
pride
,
and
make
me
the
subject
of
a
rebellious
struggle
in
her
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
"
say
I
,
"
I
have
no
warning
give
me
just
now
,
for
  
you
write
to
me
to
come
to
you
,
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
"
say
Estella
,
with
a
cold
careless
smile
that
always
chill
me
.
  
<EOS>
after
look
at
the
twilight
without
,
for
a
little
while
,
she
go
on
to
say
:
  
<EOS>
"
the
time
have
come
round
when
Miss
Havisham
wish
to
have
me
for
a
day
at
Satis
.
<EOS>
You
be
to
take
me
there
,
and
bring
me
back
,
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
She
would
rather
I
do
not
travel
alone
,
and
object
to
receive
my
maid
,
for
she
have
a
sensitive
horror
of
be
talk
of
by
such
people
.
<EOS>
Can
you
take
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
take
you
,
Estella
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
then
?
<EOS>
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
You
be
to
pay
all
charge
out
of
my
purse
.
<EOS>
You
hear
the
condition
of
your
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
must
obey
,
"
say
I.
  
this
be
all
the
preparation
I
receive
for
that
visit
,
or
for
other
like
it
:
<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
never
write
to
me
,
nor
have
I
ever
so
much
as
see
her
handwriting
.
<EOS>
We
go
down
on
the
next
day
but
one
,
and
we
find
her
in
the
room
where
I
have
first
beheld
her
,
and
it
be
needless
to
add
that
there
be
no
change
in
Satis
House
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
even
more
dreadfully
fond
of
Estella
than
she
have
be
when
I
last
see
them
together
;
I
repeat
the
word
advisedly
,
for
there
be
something
positively
dreadful
in
the
energy
of
her
look
and
embrace
.
<EOS>
She
hang
upon
Estella
's
beauty
,
hang
upon
her
word
,
hang
upon
her
gesture
,
and
sit
mumble
her
own
tremble
finger
while
she
look
at
her
,
as
though
she
be
devour
the
beautiful
creature
she
have
rear
.
  
<EOS>
from
Estella
she
look
at
me
,
with
a
search
glance
that
seem
to
pry
into
my
heart
and
probe
its
wound
.
<EOS>
"
how
do
she
use
you
,
Pip
;
how
do
she
use
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
me
again
,
with
her
witch
-
like
eagerness
,
even
in
Estella
's
hearing
.
<EOS>
but
,
when
we
sit
by
her
flickering
fire
at
night
,
she
be
most
weird
;
for
then
,
keep
Estella
's
hand
draw
through
her
arm
and
clutch
in
her
own
hand
,
she
extort
from
her
,
by
dint
of
refer
back
to
what
Estella
have
tell
her
in
her
regular
letter
,
the
name
and
condition
of
the
man
whom
she
have
fascinate
;
and
as
Miss
Havisham
dwelt
upon
this
roll
,
with
the
intensity
of
a
mind
mortally
hurt
and
disease
,
she
sit
with
her
other
hand
on
her
crutch
stick
,
and
her
chin
on
that
,
and
her
wan
bright
eye
glare
at
me
,
a
very
spectre
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
in
this
,
wretched
though
it
make
me
,
and
bitter
the
sense
of
dependence
and
even
of
degradation
that
it
awaken
<EOS>
---
I
see
in
this
,
that
Estella
be
set
to
wreak
Miss
Havisham
's
revenge
on
man
,
and
that
she
be
not
to
be
give
to
me
until
she
have
gratify
it
for
a
term
.
<EOS>
I
see
in
this
,
a
reason
for
her
be
beforehand
assign
to
me
.
<EOS>
send
her
out
to
attract
and
torment
and
do
mischief
,
Miss
Havisham
send
her
with
the
malicious
assurance
that
she
be
beyond
the
reach
of
all
admirer
,
and
that
all
who
stake
upon
that
cast
be
secure
to
lose
.
<EOS>
I
see
in
this
,
that
I
,
too
,
be
torment
by
a
perversion
of
ingenuity
,
even
while
the
prize
be
reserve
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
in
this
,
the
reason
for
my
being
stave
off
so
long
,
and
the
reason
for
my
late
guardian
's
decline
to
commit
himself
to
the
formal
knowledge
of
such
a
scheme
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
see
in
this
,
Miss
Havisham
as
I
have
her
then
<EOS>
and
there
before
my
eye
,
and
always
have
have
her
before
my
eye
;
and
I
see
in
this
,
the
distinct
shadow
of
the
darkened
and
unhealthy
house
in
which
her
life
be
hide
from
the
sun
.
  
<EOS>
the
candle
that
light
that
room
of
her
be
place
in
sconce
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
They
be
high
from
the
ground
,
and
they
burn
with
the
steady
dulness
of
artificial
light
in
air
that
be
seldom
renew
.
<EOS>
as
I
look
round
at
them
,
and
at
the
pale
gloom
they
make
,
and
at
the
stop
clock
,
and
at
the
withered
article
of
bridal
dress
upon
the
table
and
the
ground
,
and
at
her
own
awful
figure
with
its
ghostly
reflection
throw
large
by
the
fire
upon
the
ceiling
and
the
wall
,
I
see
in
everything
the
construction
that
my
mind
have
come
to
,
repeat
and
throw
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
thought
pass
into
the
great
room
across
the
landing
where
the
table
be
spread
,
and
I
see
it
write
,
as
it
be
,
in
the
fall
of
the
cobwebs
from
the
centre
-
piece
,
in
the
crawling
of
the
spider
on
the
cloth
,
in
the
track
of
the
mouse
as
they
betook
their
little
quicken
heart
behind
the
panel
,
and
in
the
groping
and
pausing
of
the
beetle
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
on
the
occasion
of
this
visit
that
some
sharp
word
arise
between
Estella
and
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
I
have
ever
see
them
oppose
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
seat
by
the
fire
,
as
just
now
describe
,
and
Miss
Havisham
still
have
Estella
's
arm
draw
through
her
own
,
and
still
clutch
Estella
's
hand
in
hers
,
when
Estella
gradually
begin
to
detach
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
show
a
proud
impatience
more
than
once
before
,
and
have
rather
endure
that
fierce
affection
than
accept
or
return
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
say
Miss
Havisham
,
flash
her
eye
upon
her
,
"
be
you
tired
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
a
little
tired
of
myself
,
"
reply
Estella
,
disengage
her
arm
,
and
move
to
the
great
chimney
-
piece
,
where
she
stand
look
down
at
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
speak
the
truth
,
you
ingrate
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Miss
Havisham
,
passionately
strike
her
stick
upon
the
floor
;
"
you
be

"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
have
settle
down
,
I
hardly
know
how
,
upon
the
floor
,
among
the
fade
bridal
relic
with
which
it
be
strew
.
<EOS>
I
take
advantage
of
the
moment
---
I
have
seek
one
from
the
first
---
to
leave
the
room
,
after
beseech
Estella
's
attention
to
her
,
with
a
movement
of
my
hand
.
<EOS>
when
I
leave
,
Estella
be
yet
stand
by
the
great
chimney
-
piece
,
just
as
she
have
stand
throughout
.
<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
's
grey
hair
be
all
adrift
upon
the
ground
,
among
the
other
bridal
wreck
,
and
be
a
miserable
sight
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
with
a
depressed
heart
that
I
walk
in
the
starlight
for
an
hour
and
more
,
about
the
court
-
yard
,
and
about
the
brewery
,
and
about
the
ruin
garden
.
<EOS>
when
I
at
last
take
courage
to
return
to
the
room
,
I
find
Estella
sit
at
Miss
Havisham
's
knee
,
take
up
some
stitch
in
one
of
those
old
article
of
dress
that
be
drop
to
piece
,
and
of
which
I
have
often
be
remind
since
by
the
fade
tatter
of
old
banner
that
I
have
see
hang
up
in
cathedral
.
<EOS>
afterwards
,
Estella
and
I
play
at
card
,
as
of
yore
---
only
we
be
skilful
now
,
and
play
french
game
---
and
so
the
evening
wear
away
,
and
I
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
lie
in
that
separate
building
across
the
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
I
have
ever
lain
down
to
rest
in
Satis
House
,
and
sleep
refuse
to
come
near
me
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
Miss
Havishams
haunt
me
.
<EOS>
She
be
on
this
side
of
my
pillow
,
on
that
,
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
at
the
foot
,
behind
the
half
-
open
door
of
the
dressing
-
room
,
in
the
dressing
-
room
,
in
the
room
overhead
,
in
the
room
beneath
---
everywhere
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
the
night
be
slow
to
creep
on
towards
two
o'clock
,
I
feel
that
I
absolutely
could
no
longer
bear
the
place
as
a
place
to
lie
down
in
,
and
that
I
must
get
up
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
get
up
and
put
on
my
clothe
,
and
go
out
across
the
yard
into
the
long
stone
passage
,
design
to
gain
the
outer
court
-
yard
and
walk
there
for
the
relief
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
be
no
sooner
in
the
passage
than
I
extinguish
my
candle
;
for
,
I
see
Miss
Havisham
go
along
it
in
a
ghostly
manner
,
make
a
low
cry
.
<EOS>
I
follow
her
at
a
distance
,
and
see
her
go
up
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
She
carry
a
bare
candle
in
her
hand
,
which
she
have
probably
take
from
one
of
the
sconce
in
her
own
room
,
and
be
a
most
unearthly
object
by
its
light
.
<EOS>
stand
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
,
I
feel
the
mildewed
air
of
the
feast
-
chamber
,
without
see
her
open
the
door
,
and
I
hear
her
walk
there
,
and
so
across
into
her
own
room
,
and
so
across
again
into
that
,
never
cease
the
low
cry
.
<EOS>
after
a
time
,
I
try
in
the
dark
both
to
get
out
,
and
to
go
back
,
but
I
could
do
neither
until
some
streak
of
day
stray
in
and
show
me
where
to
lay
my
hand
.
<EOS>
during
the
whole
interval
,
whenever
I
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
,
I
hear
her
footstep
,
see
her
light
pass
above
,
and
hear
her
ceaseless
low
cry
.
  
<EOS>
before
we
leave
next
day
,
there
be
no
revival
of
the
difference
  
between
her
and
Estella
,
nor
be
it
ever
revive
on
any
similar
  
occasion
;
and
there
be
four
similar
occasion
,
to
the
good
of
my
remembrance
.
<EOS>
nor
,
do
Miss
Havisham
's
manner
towards
Estella
in
anywise
change
,
except
that
I
believe
it
to
have
something
like
fear
infuse
among
its
former
characteristic
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
turn
this
leaf
of
my
life
,
without
put
Bentley
Drummle
's
name
upon
it
;
or
I
would
,
very
gladly
.
  
<EOS>
on
a
certain
occasion
when
the
Finches
be
assemble
in
force
,
and
when
good
feeling
be
be
promote
in
the
usual
manner
by
nobody
be
agree
with
anybody
else
,
the
preside
Finch
call
the
Grove
to
order
,
forasmuch
as
Mr
Drummle
have
not
yet
toast
a
lady
;
which
,
accord
to
the
solemn
constitution
of
the
society
it
be
the
brute
's
turn
to
do
that
day
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
see
him
leer
in
an
ugly
way
at
me
while
the
decanter
be
go
round
,
but
as
there
be
no
love
lose
between
us
,
that
may
easily
be
.
<EOS>
what
be
my
indignant
surprise
when
he
call
upon
the
company
to
pledge
him
to
"
Estella
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Estella
who
?
<EOS>
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
never
you
mind
,
"
retort
Drummle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Estella
of
where
?
"
say
I.
"
You
be
bind
to
say
of
where
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
which
he
be
,
as
a
Finch
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
Richmond
,
gentleman

"
say
Drummle
,
put
me
out
of
the
question
,
"
and
a
peerless
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
much
he
know
about
peerless
beauty
,
a
mean
miserable
idiot
!
<EOS>
I
whisper
Herbert

<EOS>
"
I
know
that
lady
,
"
say
Herbert
,
across
the
table
,
when
the
toast
have
be
honour

<EOS>
"
\
<EOS>
do
\
 
you
?
"
say
Drummle

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
do
I

,
"
I
add
,
with
a
scarlet
face

<EOS>
"
\
<EOS>
do

you

Drummle

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
oh

Lord

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
retort
---
except
glass
or
crockery
---
that
the
heavy
creature
be
capable
of
make
;
but
,
I
become
as
highly
incensed
by
it
as
if
it
have
be
barb
with
wit
,
and
I
immediately
rise
in
my
place
and
say
that
I
could
not
but
regard
it
as
be
like
the
honourable
Finch
's
impudence
to
come
down
to
that
Grove
<EOS>
---
we
always
talk
about
come
down
to
that
Grove
,
as
a
neat
parliamentary
turn
of
expression
---
down
to
that
Grove
,
propose
  
a
lady
of
whom
he
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
Mr
Drummle
upon
this
,
start
  
up
,
demand
what
I
mean
by
that
?
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
I
make
him
the
  
extreme
reply
that
I
believe
he
know
where
I
be
to
be
find
.
   
<EOS>
whether
it
be
possible
in
a
christian
country
to
get
on
without
  
blood
,
after
this
,
be
a
question
on
which
the
Finches
be
divide
.
  
<EOS>
the
debate
upon
it
grow
so
lively
,
indeed
,
that
at
least
six
more
  
honourable
member
tell
six
more
,
during
the
discussion
,
that
they
  
believe
 
\
<EOS>
they
\
 
<EOS>
know
where
 
\
<EOS>
they
\
 
<EOS>
be
to
be
find
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
  
<EOS>
decide
at
last
(
the
Grove
be
a
Court
of
Honour
)
that
if
Mr
  
Drummle
would
bring
never
so
slight
a
certificate
from
the
lady
,
  
import
that
he
have
the
honour
of
her
acquaintance
,
<EOS>
Mr
Pip
  
must
express
his
regret
,
as
a
gentleman
and
a
Finch
,
for
"
have
  
be
betray
into
a
warmth
which
.
<EOS>
"
next
day
be
appoint
for
  
the
production
(
lest
our
honour
should
take
cold
from
delay
)
,
  
and
next
day
Drummle
appear
with
a
polite
little
avowal
in
  
Estella
's
hand
,
that
she
have
have
the
honour
of
dance
with
him
  
several
time
.
<EOS>
this
leave
me
no
course
but
to
regret
that
I
have
be
  
"
betray
into
a
warmth
<EOS>
which
,
"
and
on
the
whole
to
repudiate
,
as
  
untenable
,
the
idea
that
I
be
to
be
find
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Drummle
and
  
<EOS>
I
then
sit
snort
at
one
another
for
an
hour
,
while
the
Grove
  
engage
in
indiscriminate
contradiction
,
and
finally
the
promotion
  
of
good
feeling
be
declare
to
have
go
ahead
at
an
amazing
  
rate
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
this
lightly
,
but
it
be
no
light
thing
to
me
.
<EOS>
for
,
I
can
not
adequately
express
what
pain
it
give
me
to
think
that
Estella
should
show
any
favour
to
a
contemptible
,
clumsy
,
sulky
booby
,
so
very
far
below
the
average
.
<EOS>
to
the
present
moment
,
I
believe
it
to
have
be
referable
to
some
pure
fire
of
generosity
and
disinterestedness
in
my
love
for
her
,
that
I
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
her
stoop
to
that
hound
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
I
should
have
be
miserable
whomsoever
she
have
favour
;
but
a
worthy
object
would
have
cause
me
a
different
kind
and
degree
of
distress
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
for
me
to
find
out
,
and
I
do
soon
find
out
,
that
Drummle
have
begin
to
follow
her
closely
,
and
that
she
allow
him
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
a
little
while
,
and
he
be
always
in
pursuit
of
her
,
and
he
and
I
cross
one
another
every
day
.
<EOS>
He
hold
on
,
in
a
dull
persistent
way
,
and
Estella
hold
him
on
;
now
with
encouragement
,
now
with
discouragement
,
now
almost
flatter
him
,
now
openly
despise
him
,
now
know
him
very
well
,
now
scarcely
remember
who
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
Spider
,
as
Mr
Jaggers
have
call
him
,
be
use
to
lie
in
wait
,
however
,
and
have
the
patience
of
his
tribe
.
<EOS>
add
to
that
,
he
have
a
blockhead
confidence
in
his
money
and
in
his
family
greatness
,
which
sometimes
do
him
good
service
---
almost
take
the
place
of
concentration
and
determined
purpose
.
<EOS>
so
,
the
Spider
,
doggedly
watch
Estella
,
outwatche
many
bright
insect
,
and
would
often
uncoil
himself
and
drop
at
the
right
nick
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
at
a
certain
Assembly
Ball
at
Richmond
(
there
use
to
be
Assembly
Balls
at
most
place
then
)
,
where
Estella
have
outshone
all
other
beauty
,
this
blunder
Drummle
so
hang
about
her
,
and
with
so
much
toleration
on
her
part
,
that
I
resolve
to
speak
to
her
concern
him
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
next
opportunity
:
which
be
when
she
be
wait
for
Mrs
Brandley
to
take
her
home
,
and
be
sit
apart
among
some
flower
,
ready
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
be
with
her
,
for
I
almost
always
accompany
them
to
and
from
such
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
tired
,
Estella
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
rather
,
Pip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
say
rather
,
I
should
not
be
;
for
I
have
my
letter
to
Satis
House
to
write
,
before
I
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I.

surely
a

Estella

<EOS>

what

<EOS>
I

Estella

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
I

return
Estella
,
with
her
eye
on
me
instead
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
there
in
that

corner
yonder

to
use
your
word
---
that
I
need

"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed

that
be
the
very
question
I
want
to

I.

Estella
,
with
a
glance
towards
him
,
"
hover
about
a
light
candle

<EOS>
Can
the
candle
help
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
"
I
return
;
"
but
can
not
the

it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
!
"
say
she
,
laugh
,
after
a
moment
,
"
perhaps
.
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
anything
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Estella
,
do
hear
me
speak
.
<EOS>
It
make
me
wretched
that
you
should
encourage
a
man
so
generally
despise
as
Drummle
.
<EOS>
You
know
he
be
despised
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
he
be
as
ungainly

as
without

a
deficient

ill

lower

stupid

"
  
<EOS>

she

<EOS>
"
You
know
he
have
nothing
to
recommend
him

money

a
ridiculous
roll
of
addle

head
predecessor

now
,
do
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

"
say
she
again
;
and
each
time
she
say
it
,
she
open
her
lovely
eye
the
wide
.
  
<EOS>
to
overcome
the
difficulty
of
get
past
that
monosyllable
,
I
take
it
from
her
,
and
say
,
repeat
it
with
emphasis
,
"
well
!
<EOS>
then
,
that
be
why
it
make
me
wretched
.
"
  
<EOS>
now
,
if
I
could
have
believe
that
she
favour
Drummle
with
any
idea
of
make
me
---
me
---
wretched
,
I
should
have
be
in
well
heart
about
it
;
but
in
that
habitual
way
of
hers
,
she
put
me
so
entirely
out
of
the
question
,
that
I
could
believe
nothing
of
the
kind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pip
,
"
say
Estella
,
cast
her
glance
over
the
room
,
"
do
not
be
foolish
about
its
effect

<EOS>
It
may
have
its
effect
on

may
be
mean

<EOS>
It
be
not
worth

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
it
be

I

because
I

<EOS>
and
now
that
I
have
give
the
one
chapter
to
the
theme
that
so
fill
my
heart
,
and
so
often
make
it
ache
and
ache
again
<EOS>
,
I
pass
on
,
unhindered

to
the
event
that
have
impend
over
me
longer
yet
;
<EOS>
the
event
that
have
begin
to
be
prepare
for
,
before
I
know
that
the
world
hold
Estella
,
and
in
the
day
when
her
baby
intelligence
be
receive
its
first
distortion
from
Miss
Havisham
's
waste
hand
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
eastern
story
,
the
heavy
slab
that
be
to
fall
on
the
bed
of
state
in
the
flush
of
conquest
be
slowly
work
out
of
the
quarry
,
the
tunnel
for
the
rope
to
hold
it
in
its
place

slowly
carry
through
the
league
of
rock
,
the
slab

slowly
raise
and
fit
in
the
roof
,
the
rope
be
rove
to
it
and
slowly
take
through
the
mile
of
hollow
to
the
great
iron
ring
.
<EOS>
all
be
make
ready
with
much
labour
,
and
the
hour
come
,
the
sultan
be
arouse
in
the
dead
of
the
night

and
the
sharpened
axe
that
be
to
sever
the
rope
from
the
great
iron
ring
be
put
into

and
he
strike
with
it

and
the
rope
part
and
rush
away
,
and
the
ceiling

<EOS>
so
,
in
my
case
;
all
the
work

near

afar

that
tend

Chapter
39
 
<EOS>
I
be
three
-
and
-
twenty
year
of
age
.
<EOS>
not
another
word
have
I
hear
to
enlighten
me
on
the
subject
of
my
expectation

and
my
twenty

third
birthday
be
a
week
go

<EOS>
We
have
leave
Barnard

Inn
more
than
a
year
,
and
live
in
the
Temple
.
<EOS>
Our
chamber

Garden

down

<EOS>
Mr
Pocket
<EOS>
and
I
have
for
some
time
part
company
as
to
our
original
relation
,
though
we
continue
on
the
good
term
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
my
inability
to
settle
to
anything
---
which
I
hope
arise
out
of
the
restless
and
incomplete
tenure
on
which
I
hold
my

---
I
have
a
taste
for
reading
,
and
read
regularly
so
many
hour
a
day
.
<EOS>
that
matter
of
Herbert

and
everything

<EOS>
business

take
Herbert
on
a
journey
to
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
I
be
alone
,
and
have
a
dull
sense
of
be
alone
.
<EOS>
dispirited
and
anxious
,
long
hope
that
to

morrow
or
next
week
would
clear
my
way
,
and
long
disappointed
,
I
sadly
miss
the
cheerful

and
ready
response
of
my
friend

<EOS>
It
be
wretched
weather
;
stormy
and
wet
,
stormy
and
wet
;
and
mud
,
mud
,
mud
,
deep
in
all
the
street
.
<EOS>
day
after
day
,
a
vast
heavy
veil
have
be
drive
over
London
from
the
East
,
and
it
drive
still
,
as
if
in
the
East
there
be
an
eternity
of
cloud
and
wind
.
<EOS>
so
furious
have
be
the
gust
,
that
high
building
in
town
have
have
the
lead
strip
off
their
roof
;
and
in
the
country
,
tree
have
be
tear
up
,
and
sail
of
windmill
carry
away
;
and
gloomy
account
have
come
in
from
the
coast
,
of
shipwreck
and
death
.
<EOS>
violent
blast
of
rain
have
accompany
these
rage
of
wind
,
and
the
day
just
close
as
I
sit
down
to
read
<EOS>
have
be
the
bad
of
all
.
  
<EOS>
alteration
have
be
make
in
that
part
of
the
Temple
since
that
time
,
and
it
have
not
now
so
lonely
a
character
as
it
have
then
,
nor
be
it
so
exposed
to
the
river
.
<EOS>
We
live
at
the
top
of
the
last
house
,
and
the
wind
rush
up
the
river
shake
the
house
that
night
,
like
discharge
of
cannon
,
or
breaking
of
a
sea
.
<EOS>
when
the
rain
come
with
it
and
dash
against
the
window
,
I
think
,
raise
my
eye
to
them
as
they
rock
,
that
I
may
have
fancy
myself
in
a
storm
-
beat
light
-
house
.
<EOS>
occasionally
,
the
smoke
come
roll
down
the
chimney
as
though
it
could
not
bear
to
go
out
into
such
a
night
;
and
when
I
set
the
door
open
and
look
down
the
staircase
,
the
staircase
lamp
be
blow
out
;
and
when
I
shade
my
face
with
my
hand
and
look
through
the
black
window
(
open
them
ever
so
little
,
be
out
of
the
question
in
the
tooth
of
such
wind
and
rain
)
<EOS>
I
see
that
the
lamp
in
the
court
be
blow
out
,
and
that
the
lamp
on
the
bridge
and
the
shore
be
shudder
,
and
that
the
coal
fire
in
barge
on
the
river
be
be
carry
away
before
the
wind
like
red
-
hot
splash
in
the
rain
.
  
<EOS>
I
read
with
my
watch
upon
the
table
,
purpose
to
close
my
book
at
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
as
I
shut
it
,
Saint
Paul
's
,
and
all
the
many
church
-
clock
in
the
City
---
some
lead
,
some
accompanying
,
some
following
---
strike
that
hour
.
<EOS>
the
sound
be
curiously
flaw
by
the
wind
;
and
I
be
listen
,
and
think
how
the
wind
assail
and
tear
it
,
when
I
hear
a
footstep
on
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
what
nervous
folly
make
me
start
,
and
awfully
connect
it
with
the
footstep
of
my
dead
sister
,
matter
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
past
in
a
moment
,
and
I
listen
again
,
and
hear
the
footstep
stumble
in
come
on
.
<EOS>
remember
then
,
that
the
staircase
-
light
be
blow
out
,
I
take
up
my
reading
-
lamp
and
go
out
to
the
stair
-
head
.
<EOS>
whoever
be
below
have
stop
on
see
my
lamp
,
for
all
be
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
"
there

down
there

down

"
yes

a
voice
from
the
darkness
beneath
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
floor
do
you
want
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
the

Mr
Pip

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
my

there
be
nothing
the
matter

"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
the
matter
,
"
return
the
voice
.
<EOS>
and
the
man
come
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
stand
with
my
lamp
hold
out
over
the
stair
-
rail
,
and
he
come
slowly
within
its
light
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
shaded
lamp
,
to
shine
upon
a
book
,
and
its
circle
of
light
be
very
contract
;
so
that
he
be
in
it
for
a
mere
instant
,
and
then
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
instant
,
I
have
see
a
face
that
be
strange
to
me
,
look
up
with
an
incomprehensible
air
of
be
touch
and
please
by
the
sight
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
move
the
lamp
as
the
man
move
,
I
make
out
that
he
be
substantially
dress
,
but
roughly
;
like
a
voyager
by
sea
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
long
iron
-
grey
hair
.
<EOS>
that
his
age
be
about
sixty
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
a
muscular
man
,
strong
on
his
leg
,
and
that
he
be
brown
and
harden
by
exposure
to
weather
.
<EOS>
as
he
ascend
the
last
stair
or
two
,
and
the
light
of
my
lamp
include
us
both
,
I
see
,
with
a
stupid
kind
of
amazement
,
that
he
be
hold
out
both
his
hand
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
what
be
your
business
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
business
?
"
he
repeat
,
pause
.
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
will
explain
my
business
,
by
your
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
wish
to
come
in
?
"
  
"
yes
,
"
he
reply
;
"
I
wish
to
come
in
,
Master
.
"
  
I
have
ask
him
the
question
inhospitably
enough
,
for
I
resent
the
sort
of
bright
and
gratified
recognition
that
still
shine
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
resent
it
,
because
it
seem
to
imply
that
he
expect
me
to
respond
to
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
take
him
into
the
room
I
have
just
leave
,
and
,
have
set
the
lamp
on
the
table
,
ask
him
as
civilly
as
I
could
,
to
explain
himself
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
about
him
with
the
strange
air
---
an
air
of
wonder
pleasure
as
if
he
have
some
part
in
the
thing
he
admire
---
and
he
pull
off
a
rough
outer
coat
,
and
his
hat
.
<EOS>
then
,
I
see
that
his
head
be
furrowed
and
bald
,
and
that
the
long
iron
-
grey
hair
grow
only
on
its
side
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
see
nothing
that
in
the
least
explain
him
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
see
him
next
moment
,
once
more
hold
out
both
his
hand
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
"
say
I
,
half
suspect
him
to
be
mad
.
  
<EOS>
He
stop
in
his
looking
at
me
,
and
slowly
rub
his
right
hand
over
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
disappointing
to
a
man
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
coarse
break
voice
,
"
arter
have
look
for'ard
so
distant
,
and
come
so
fur
;
but
you
be
not
to
blame
for
that
---
neither
on
us
be
to
blame
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
will
speak
in
half
a
minute
.
<EOS>
give
me
half
a
minute
,
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
sit
down
on
a
chair
that
stand
before
the
fire
,
and
cover
his
forehead
with
his
large
brown
veinous
hand
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
attentively
then
,
and
recoil
a
little
from
him
;
but
I
do
not
know
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
one
nigh
,
"
say
he
,
look
over
his
shoulder
;
"
be
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
,
a
stranger
come
into
my
room
at
this
time
of
the
night
,
ask
that
question
?
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
game
one
,
"
he
return
,
shake
his
head
at
me
with
a
deliberate
affection
,
at
once
most
unintelligible
and
most
exasperating
;
"
I
be
glad
you
have
<EOS>
grow'd
up
,
a
game
one
!
<EOS>
but
do
not
catch
hold
of
me

<EOS>
You
would
be
sorry
arterward
to
have
do
it

<EOS>
I
relinquish
the
intention
he
have
detect
,
for
I
know
him
!
<EOS>
even
yet
,
I
could
not
recall
a
single
feature
,
but
I
know
him
!

if
the
wind
and
the
rain
have
drive
away
the
intervene
year
,
have
scatter
all
the
intervening
object

have
sweep
us
to
the
churchyard
where
we
first
stand
face
to
face
on
such
different
level
,
I
could
not
have
know
my
convict
more
distinctly
than
I
know
him
now
,
as
he
sit
in
the
chair
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
no
need
to
take
a
file
from
his
pocket
and
show
it
to
me
;
no
need
to
take
the
handkerchief
from
his
neck
and
twist
<EOS>
it
round
his
head
;
<EOS>
no
need
to
hug
himself
with
both
his
arm
,
and
take
a
shivering
turn
across
the
room
,
look
back
at
me
for
recognition
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
before
he
give
me
one
of
those
aid
,
though
,
<EOS>
a
moment
before
,
I
have
not
be
conscious
of
remotely
suspect
his
identity
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
back
to
where
I
stand
,
and
again
hold
out
both
his
hand
.
<EOS>
not
know
what
to
do
---
for
,
in
my
astonishment
I
have
lose
my
self
-
possession
---
I
reluctantly
give
him
my
hand
.
<EOS>
He
grasp
them
heartily
,
raise
them
to
his
lip
,
kiss
them
,
and
still
hold
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

"
<EOS>
Noble

never

"
  
<EOS>
at
a
change
in
his
manner
as
if
he
be
even
go
to
embrace
me
,
I
lay
a
hand
upon
his
breast
and
put
him
away
.

"
stay

I.

off

away

<EOS>
He
have
replace
his
neckerchief
loosely
,
and
have
stand
,
keenly
observant
of
me
,
bite
a
long
end
of
it
.

"
I
think
,

he
answer
,
still
with
the
end
at
his
mouth

still
observant
of
me

afore

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
tray
ready
on
a
side
-
table
.
<EOS>
I
bring
it
to
the
table
near
the
fire
,
and
ask
him
what
he
would
have
?
<EOS>
He
touch
one
of
the
bottle
without
look
at
it
or
speak
,
and
I
make
him
some
hot
rum
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
keep
my
hand
steady
while
I
do
so
,
but
his
look
at
me
as
he
lean
back
in
his
chair
with
the
long
draggle
end
of
his
neckerchief
between
his
tooth
---
evidently
forget
---
make
my
hand
very
difficult
to
master
.
<EOS>
when
at
last
I
put
the
glass
to
him
,
I
see
with
amazement
that
his
eye
be
full
of
tear
.
  
<EOS>
up
to
this
time
<EOS>
I
have
remain
stand
,
not
to
disguise
that
I
wish
him
go

<EOS>
but
I
be
soften
by
the
soften
aspect
of
the
man
,
and
feel
a
touch
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
say
I
,
hurriedly
put
something
into
a
glass
for
myself
,
and
draw
a
chair
to
the
table
,
"
that
you
will
not

harshly

you

now

I
have
no

<EOS>
as
I
put
my

to
my
lip

he
glance
with
surprise
at
the
end

drop
from

mine

without

the
tone
in

they

I
turn
off

I
take
out

They

"
May
I

bold

he
say
then
,
with
a
smile

be

I
try

collect
my

be
stunned

<EOS>
throughout
,
I
have
seem
to
myself
to
attend
more
to

wind

rain

be
loud

be

drop
his

come

hang
if

<EOS>
nothing
be
need
but
this
;
the
wretched
man
,
after
load
wretche
me
with
his
gold
and
silver
chain
for
year
,
have
risk
his
life
to
come
to
me
,
and
I
hold
it
there
in
my
keeping
!
<EOS>
if
I
have
love
him
instead
of
abhor
him
;
if
I
have
be
attract
to
him
by
the
strong
admiration
and
affection
,
instead
of
shrink
from
him
with
the
strong
repugnance
;
it
could
have
be
no
bad

<EOS>
on
the
contrary

it
would
have
be
well
,
for
his
preservation
would
then
have
naturally
and
tenderly
address
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
care
be
to
close
the
shutter
,
so
that
no
light
may
be
see
from
without
,
and
then
to
close
and
make
fast
the
door
.
<EOS>
while
I
do
so
,
he
stand
at
the
table
drinking
rum
and
eat
biscuit
;
and
when
I
see
him
thus
engage
,
I
see
my
convict
on
the
marsh
at
his
meal
again
.
<EOS>
It
almost
seem
to
me
as
if
he
must
stoop
down
presently
,
to
file
at
his
leg
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
go
into
Herbert
's
room
,
and
have
shut
off
any
other
communication
between
it
and
the
staircase
than
through
the
room
in
which
our
conversation
have
be
hold
,
I
ask
him
if
he
would
go
to
bed
?
<EOS>
He
say
yes
,
but
ask
me
for
some
of
my
"
gentleman
's
linen
"
to
put
on
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
I
bring
it
out
,
and
lay
it
ready
for
him
,
and
my
blood
again
run
cold
when
he
again
take
me
by
both
hand
to
give
me
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
away
from
him
,
without
know
how
I
do
it
,
and
mend
the
fire
in
the
room
where
we
have
be
together
,
and
sit
down
by
it
,
afraid
to
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
for
an
hour
or
more
,
I
remain
too
stunned
to
think
;
and
it
be
not
until
I
begin
to
think
,
that
I
begin
fully
to
know
how
wreck
I
be
,
and
how
the
ship
in
which
I
have
sail
be
go
to
piece
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
's
intention
towards
me
,
all
a
mere
dream
<EOS>
;
Estella
not
design
for
me
;
I
only
suffer
in
Satis
House
as
a
convenience
,
a
sting
for
the
greedy
relation
,
a
model
with
a
mechanical
heart
to
practise
on
when
no
other
practice
be
at
hand
;
those
be
the
first
smart
I
have
.
<EOS>
but
,
sharpest
and
deep
pain
of
all
---
it
be
for
the
convict
,
guilty
of
I
know
not
what
crime
,
and
liable
to
be
take
out
of
those
room
where
I
sit
think
,
and
hang
at
the
Old
Bailey
door
,
that
I
have
desert
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
go
back
to
Joe
now
,
I
would
not
have
go
back
to
Biddy
now
,
for
any
consideration
:
simply
,
I
suppose
,
because
my
sense
of
my
own
worthless
conduct
to
them
be
great
than
every
consideration
.

no
wisdom
on
earth
could
have
give
me
the
comfort
that
I
should
have
derive
from
their
simplicity
and
fidelity
;
but
I
could
never
,
never
,
never
,
undo
what
I
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
in
every
rage
of
wind
and
rush
of
rain
,
I
hear
pursuer
.
<EOS>
twice
,
I
could
have
swear
there
be
a
knocking
and
whisper
at
the
outer
door
.
<EOS>
with
these
fear
upon
me
,
I
begin
either
to
imagine
or
recall
that
I
have
have
mysterious
warning
of
this
man
's
approach
.
<EOS>
that
,
for
week
go
by
,
I
have
pass
face
in
the
street
which
I
have
think
like
his
.
<EOS>
that
,
these
likeness
have
grow
more
numerous
,
as
he
,
come
over
the
sea
,
have
draw
nearer
.
<EOS>
that
,
his
wicked
spirit
have
somehow
send
these
messenger
to
mine
,
and
that
now
on
this
stormy
night
he
be
as
good
as
his
word
,
and
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
crowd
up
with
these
reflection
come
the
reflection
that
I
have
see
him
with
my
childish
eye
to
be
a
desperately
violent
man
;
that
I
have
hear
that
other
convict
reiterate
that
he
have
try
to
murder
him
;
that
I
have
see
him
down
in
the
ditch
tearing
and
fighting
like
a
wild
beast
.
<EOS>
out
of
such
remembrance
I
bring
into
the
light
of
the
fire
,
a
half
-
form
terror
that
it
may
not
be
safe
to
be
shut
up
there
with
him
in
the
dead
of
the
wild
solitary
night
.
<EOS>
this
dilate
until
it
fill
the
room
,
and
impel
me
to
take
a
candle
and
go
in
and
look
at
my
dreadful
burden
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
roll
a
handkerchief
round
his
head
,
and
his
face
be
set
and
lower
in
his
sleep
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
asleep
,
and
quietly
too
,
though
he
have
a
pistol
lie
on
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
assure
of
this
,
I
softly
remove
the
key
to
the
outside
of
his
door
,
and
turn
it
on
him
before
I
again
sit
down
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
gradually
I
slip
from
the
chair
and
lie
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
when
I
awoke
,
without
have
part
in
my
sleep
with
the
perception
of
my
wretchedness
,
the
clock
of
the
eastward
church
be
strike
five
,
the
candle
be
waste
out
,
the
fire
be
dead
,
and
the
wind
and
rain
intensify
the
thick
black
darkness
.
           
<EOS>
this
be
the
end
of
the
second
STAGE
of
                     
PIP
'S
expectation
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
40
 
it
be
fortunate
for
me
that
I
have
to
take
precaution
to
ensure
(
so
far
as
I
could
)
<EOS>
the
safety
of
my
dreaded
visitor
;
for
,
this
thought
press
on
me
when
I
awoke
,
hold
other
thought
in
a
confused
concourse
at
a
distance
.
  
<EOS>
the
impossibility
of
keep
him
conceal
in
the
chamber
be
self
-
evident
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
do
,
and
the
attempt
to
do
it
would
inevitably
engender
suspicion
.
<EOS>
true
,
I
have
no
Avenger
in
my
service
now
,
but
I
be
look
after
by
an
inflammatory
old
female
,
assist
by
an
animate
rag
-
bag
whom
she
call
her
niece
,
and
to
keep
a
room
secret
from
them
would
be
to
invite
curiosity
and
exaggeration
.
<EOS>
They
both
have
weak
eye
,
which
I
have
long
attribute
to
their
chronically
look
in
at
keyhole
,
and
they
be
always
at
hand
when
not
want
;
indeed
that
be
their
only
reliable
quality
besides
larceny
.
<EOS>
not
to
get
up
a
mystery
with
these
people
,
I
resolve
to
announce
in
the
morning
that
my
uncle
have
unexpectedly
come
from
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
this
course
I
decide
on
while
I
be
yet
grope
about
in
the
darkness
for
the
mean
of
get
a
light
.
<EOS>
not
stumble
on
the
mean
after
all
,
I
be
fain
to
go
out
to
the
adjacent
Lodge
and
get
the
watchman
there
to
come
with
his
lantern
.
<EOS>
now
,
in
grope
my
way
down
the
black
staircase
I
fall
over
something
,
and
that
something
be
a
man
crouch
in
a
corner
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
man
make
no
answer
when
I
ask
him
what
he
do
there
,
but
elude
my
touch
in
silence
,
I
run
to
the
Lodge
and
urge
the
watchman
to
come
quickly
:
tell
him
of
the
incident
on
the
way
back
.
<EOS>
the
wind
be
as
fierce
as
ever
,
we
do
not
care
to
endanger
the
light
in
the
lantern
by
rekindle
the
extinguished
lamp
on
the
staircase
,
but
we
examine
the
staircase
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
and
find
no
one
there
.
<EOS>
It
then
occur
to
me
as
possible
that
the
man
may
have
slip
into
my
room
;
so
,
light
my
candle
at
the
watchman
's
,
and
leave
him
stand
at
the
door
,
I
examine
them
carefully
,
include
the
room
in
which
my
dread
guest
lie
asleep
.
<EOS>
all
be
quiet
,
and
assuredly
no
other
man
be
in
those
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
It
trouble
me
that
there
should
have
be
a
lurker
on
the
stair
,
on
that
night
of
all
night
in
the
year
,
and
I
ask
the
watchman
,
on
the
chance
of
elicit
some
hopeful
explanation
as
I
hand
him
a
dram
at
the
door
,
whether
he
have
admit
at
his
gate
any
gentleman
who
have
perceptibly
be
dine
out
?
<EOS>
yes
,
he
say
;
at
different
time
of
the
night
,
three
.
<EOS>
one
live
in
Fountain
Court
,
and
the
other
two
live
in
the
Lane
,
and
he
have
see
them
all
go
home
.
<EOS>
again
,
the
only
other
man
who
dwell
in
the
house
of
which
my
chamber
form
a
part
,
have
be
in
the
country
for
some
week
;
and
he
certainly
have
not
return
in
the
night
,
because
we
have
see
his
door
with
his
seal
on
it
as
we
come
up
-
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
night
be
so
bad
,
sir
,
"
say
the
watchman
,
as
he
give
me
back
my
glass
,
"
uncommon
few
have
come
in
at
my
gate
.
<EOS>
besides
them
three
gentleman
that
I
have
name
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
call
to
mind
another
since
about
eleven
o'clock
,
when
a
stranger
ask
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
,
"
I
mutter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
him
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
oh
yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
likewise
the
person
with
him
?
"
  
"
person
with
him
!
"
<EOS>
I
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
judge
the
person
to
be
with
him
,
"
return
the
watchman
.
<EOS>
"
the
person
stop
,
when
he
stop
to
make
inquiry
of
me
,
and
the
person
take
this
way
when
he
take
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
sort
of
person
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
watchman
have
not
particularly
notice
;
he
should
say
a
work
person
;
to
the
good
of
his
belief
,
he
have
a
dust
-
colour
kind
of
clothe
on
,
under
a
dark
coat
.
<EOS>
the
watchman
make
more
light
of
the
matter
than
I
do
,
and
naturally
;
not
have
my
reason
for
attach
weight
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
get
rid
of
him
,
which
I
think
it
well
to
do
without
prolong
explanation
<EOS>
,
my
mind
be
much
trouble
by
these
two
circumstance
take
together
.
<EOS>
whereas
they
be
easy
of
innocent
solution
apart
---
as
,
for
instance
,
some
diner
-
out
or
diner
-
at
-
home
,
who
have
not
go
near
this
watchman
's
gate
,
may
have
stray
to
my
staircase
and
drop
asleep
there
---
and
my
nameless
visitor
may
have
bring
some
one
with
him
to
show
him
the
way
---
<EOS>
still
,
join
,
they
have
an
ugly
look
to
one
as
prone
to
distrust
and
fear
as
the
change
of
a
few
hour
have
make
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
light
my
fire
,
which
burn
with
a
raw
pale
flare
at
that
time
of
the
morning
,
and
fall
into
a
doze
before
it
.
<EOS>
I
seem
to
have
be
doze
a
whole
night
when
the
clock
strike
six
.
<EOS>
as
there
be
full
an
hour
and
a
half
between
me
and
daylight
,
I
doze
again
;
now
,
wake
up
uneasily
,
with
prolix
conversation
about
nothing
,
in
my
ear
;
now
,
make
thunder
of
the
wind
in
the
chimney
;
at
length
,
fall
off
into
a
profound
sleep
from
which
the
daylight
wake
me
with
a
start
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
I
have
never
be
able
to
consider
my
own
situation
,
nor
could
I
do
so
yet
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
power
to
attend
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
greatly
deject
and
distressed
,
but
in
an
incoherent
wholesale
sort
of
way
.
<EOS>
as
to
form
any
plan
for
the
future
,
I
could
as
soon
have
form
an
elephant
.
<EOS>
when
I
open
the
shutter
and
look
out
at
the
wet
wild
morning
,
all
of
a
leaden
hue
;
when
I
walk
from
room
to
room
;
when
I
sit
down
again
shiver
,
before
the
fire
,
wait
for
my
laundress
to
appear
;
I
think
how
miserable
I
be
,
but
hardly
know
why
,
or
how
long
I
have
be
so
,
or
on
what
day
of
the
week
I
make
the
reflection
,
or
even
who
I
be
that
make
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
the
old
woman
and
the
niece
come
in
---
the
latter
with
a
head
not
easily
distinguishable
from
her
dusty
broom
---
and
testify
surprise
at
sight
of
me
and
the
fire
.
<EOS>
to
whom
I
impart
how
my
uncle
have
come
in
the
night
and
be
then
asleep
,
and
how
the
breakfast
preparation
be
to
be
modify
accordingly
.
<EOS>
then
,
I
wash
and
dress
while
they
knock
the
furniture
about
and
make
a
dust
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
in
a
sort
of
dream
or
sleep
-
waking
,
I
find
myself
sit
by
the
fire
again
,
wait
for
---
Him
---
to
come
to
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
,
his
door
open
and
he
come
out
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
bear
the
sight
of
him
,
and
I
think
he
have
a
bad
look
by
daylight
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
even
know
,
"
say
I
,
speak
low
as
he
take
his
seat
at
the
table
,
"
by
what

out

I
ask

He
answer
quite
seriously

use

some
profession

<EOS>
"
when

say
I
,
pause
to
wonder
whether
that

seem
so
long
ago

yes

he
take
up

give

with

what
I
do

"
<EOS>
fall
to
at
his
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
He
eat
in
a
ravenous
way
that
be
very
disagreeable
,
and
all
his
action
be
uncouth
,
noisy
,
and
greedy
.
<EOS>
some
of
his
tooth
have
fail
him
since
I
see
him
eat
on
the
marsh

and
as
he
turn
his
food
in
his
mouth

and
turn
his
head
sideways
to
bring
his
strong
fang
to
bear
upon

he
look
terribly

old
dog

<EOS>
if
I
have
begin
with
any
appetite

he
would
have
take
it
away

I
should
have
sit
much
as
I
do

repel
from
him
by
an
insurmountable
aversion

gloomily
look
at
the
cloth

<EOS>
"
I
be

he
say
,
as
a
polite
kind
of
apology

I
always
be

year

there
be
,

I
will

him

then
I

him

not

<EOS>
and
now
let
me
have
a
look
at
my
gentleman
agen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
once
more
,
he
take
me
by
both
hand
and
survey
me
with
an
air
of
admire
proprietorship
:
smoke
with
great
complacency
all
the
while
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
that
I
could
do
no
better
than
secure
him
some
quiet
lodging
hard
by
,
of
which
he
may
take
possession
when
Herbert
return
:
whom
I
expect
in
two
or
three
day
.
<EOS>
that
the
secret
must
be
confide
to
Herbert
as
a
matter
of
unavoidable
necessity
,
even
if
I
could
have
put
the
immense
relief
I
should
derive
from
share
it
with
him
out
of
the
question
,
be
plain
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
by
no
means
so
plain
to
Mr
Provis
<EOS>
(
I
resolve
to
call
him
by
that
name
)
,
who
reserve
his
consent
to
Herbert
's
participation
until
he
should
have
see
him
and
form
a
favourable
judgment
of
his
physiognomy
.
"
<EOS>
and
even
then
,
dear
boy
,
"
say
he
,
pull
a
greasy
little
clasped
black
Testament
out
of
his
pocket
,
"
we
will
have
him
on
his
oath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
state
that
my
terrible
patron
carry
this
little
black
book
about
the
world
solely
to
swear
people
on
in
case
of
emergency
,
would
be
to
state
what
I
never
quite
established
---
but
this
I
can
say
,
that
I
never
know
him
put
it
to
any
other
use
.
<EOS>
the
book
itself
have
the
appearance
of
have
be
steal
from
some
court
of
justice
,
and
perhaps
his
knowledge
of
its
antecedent
,
combine
with
his
own
experience
in
that
wise
,
give
him
a
reliance
on
its
power
as
a
sort
of
legal
spell
or
charm
.
<EOS>
on
this
first
occasion
of
his
produce
it
,
I
recall
how
he
have
make
me
swear
fidelity
in
the
churchyard
long
ago
,
and
how
he
have
describe
himself
last
night
as
always
swear
to
his
resolution
in
his
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
be
at
present
dress
in
a
seafare
slop
suit
,
in
which
he
look
as
if
he
have
some
parrot
and
cigar
to
dispose
of
<EOS>
,
I
next
discuss
with
him
what
dress
he
should
wear
.
<EOS>
He
cherish
an
extraordinary
belief
in
the
virtue
of
"
short
"
as
a
disguise
,
and
have
in
his
own
mind
sketch
a
dress
for
himself
that
would
have
make
him
something
between
a
dean
and
a
dentist
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
considerable
difficulty
that
I
win
him
over
to
the
assumption
of
a
dress
more
like
a
prosperous
farmer
's
;
and
we
arrange
that
he
should
cut
his
hair
close
,
and
wear
a
little
powder
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
as
he
have
not
yet
be
see
by
the
laundress
or
her
niece
,
he
be
to
keep
himself
out
of
their
view
until
his
change
of
dress
be
make
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
seem
a
simple
matter
to
decide
on
these
precaution
;
but
in
my
dazed
,
not
to
say
distracted
,
state
,
it
take
so
long
,
that
I
do
not
get
out
to
further
them
,
until
two
or
three
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
remain
shut
up
in
the
chamber
while
I
be
go
,
and
be
on
no
account
to
open
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
to
my
knowledge
a
respectable
lodging
-
house
in
Essex
-
street
,
the
back
of
which
look
into
the
Temple
,
and
be
almost
within
hail
of
my
window
,
I
first
of
all
repair
to
that
house
,
and
be
so
fortunate
as
to
secure
the
second
floor
for
my
uncle
,
Mr
Provis
.
<EOS>
I
then
go
from
shop
to
shop
,
make
such
purchase
as
be
necessary
to
the
change
in
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
this
business
transact
,
I
turn
my
face
,
on
my
own
account
,
to
Little
Britain
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
be
at
his
desk
,
but
,
see
me
enter
,
get
up
immediately
and
stand
before
his
fire

now

<EOS>

I

for

come
along

think
well

I

go
to

do

yourself

Mr

do
not

me
anything

I
do
not

no

I
may
verify
it

Mr
Jaggers
nod

do
you
say

tell

he
ask
me
,
with
his
head
on

side

not

at
me

look
in
a
listening
way
at
the
floor

seem
to
imply
verbal
communication

at

disclose
himself

Mr

"
you
will
comprehend
,
Pip

how
rigidly
throughout
my

I

always
adhere
to

quite
,

<EOS>

I
communicate
to

---
in
New

when
he
first
write
to
me

from
New

<EOS>
the
caution
that
he
must
not
expect
me
ever
to
deviate
from
the
strict
line
of
fact

<EOS>
I
also
communicate
to
him
another
caution
.
<EOS>
He
appear
to
me
to
have
obscurely
hint
in
his
letter
at
some
distant
idea
he
have
of
see
you
in
England
here

<EOS>
I
caution
him
that
I
must
hear
no
more
of
that
;
that
he
be
not
at
all
likely
to
obtain
a
pardon
;
that
he
be
expatriate
for
the
term
of
his
natural
life
;
and
that
his
present
himself
in
this
country
would
be
an
act
of
felony
,
render
him
liable
to
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law

<EOS>
I
give
Magwitch
that
caution

Mr

look
hard

turn
at

door

still
look
hard
at

while
the
two
vile
cast
on
the
shelf
seem
to
be
try
to
get
the
it
eyelid
open
,
and
to
force
out
of
their
swollen
throat
,
"
o
,
what
a
man
he
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
Wemmick
be
out
,
and
though
he
have
be
at
his
desk
he
could
have
do
nothing
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
go
straight
back
to
the
Temple
,
where
I
find
the
terrible
provi
drink
rum
-
and
-
water
and
smoke
negro
-
head
,
in
safety
.
  
<EOS>
next
day
the
clothe
I
have
order
,
all
come
home
,
and
he
put
them
on
.
<EOS>
whatever
he
put
on
,
become
him
less
(
it
dismally
seem
to
me
)
than
what
he
have
wear
before
.
<EOS>
to
my
thinking
,
there
be
something
in
him
that
make
it
hopeless
to
attempt
to
disguise
him
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
dress
him
and
the
well
I
dress
him
,
the
more
he
look
like
the
slouch
fugitive
on
the
marsh
.
<EOS>
this
effect
on
my
anxious
fancy
be
partly
referable
,
no
doubt
,
to
his
old
face
and
manner
grow
more
familiar
to
me
:
but
I
believe
too
that
he
drag
one
of
his
leg
as
if
there
be
still
a
weight
of
iron
on
it
,
and
that
from
head
to
foot
there
be
Convict
in
the
very
grain
of
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
the
influence
of
his
solitary
hut
-
life
be
upon
him
besides
,
and
give
him
a
savage
air
that
no
dress
could
tame
;
add
to
these
,
be
the
influence
of
his
subsequent
brand
life
among
man
,
and
,
crown
all
,
his
consciousness
that
he
be
dodge
and
hide
now
.
<EOS>
in
all
his
way
of
sit
and
stand
,
and
eating
and
drink
---
of
brood
about
,
in
a
high
-
shouldered
reluctant
style
---
of
take
out
his
great
horn
-
handle
jack
-
knife
and
wipe
it
on
his
leg
and
cut
his
food
---
of
lift
light
glass
and
cup
to
his
lip
,
as
if
they
be
clumsy
pannikin
---
of
chop
a
wedge
off
his
bread
,
and
soak
up
with
it
the
last
fragment
of
gravy
round
and
round
his
plate
,
as
if
to
make
the
most
of
an
allowance
,
and
then
dry
his
finger
-
end
on
it
,
and
then
swallow
it
---
in
these
way
and
a
thousand
other
small
nameless
instance
arise
every
minute
in
the
day
,
there
be
prisoner
,
Felon
,
Bondsman
,
<EOS>
plain
as
plain
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
his
own
idea
to
wear
that
touch
of
powder
,
and
I
have
concede
the
powder
after
overcome
the
short
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
compare
the
effect
of
it
,
when
on
,
to
nothing
but
the
probable
effect
of
rouge
upon
the
dead
;
so
awful
be
the
manner
in
which
everything
in
him
that
it
be
most
desirable
to
repress
,
start
through
that
thin
layer
of
pretence
,
and
seem
to
come
blaze
out
at
the
crown
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
It
be
abandon
as
soon
as
try
,
and
he
wear
his
grizzle
hair
cut
short
.
  
<EOS>
word
can
not
tell
what
a
sense
I
have
,
at
the
same
time
,
of
the
dreadful
mystery
that
he
be
to
me
.
<EOS>
when
he
fall
asleep
of
an
evening
,
with
his
knotted
hand
clench
the
side
of
the
easy
-
chair
,
and
his
bald
head
tattoo
with
deep
wrinkle
fall
forward
on
his
breast
,
I
would
sit
and
look
at
him
,
wonder
what
he
have
do
,
and
load
him
with
all
the
crime
in
the
Calendar
,
until
the
impulse
be
powerful
on
me
to
start
up
and
fly
from
him
.
<EOS>
every
hour
so
increase
my
abhorrence
of
him
,
that
I
even
think
I
may
have
yield
to
this
impulse
in
the
first
agony
of
be
so
haunted
,
notwithstanding
all
he
have
do
for
me
,
and
the
risk
he
run
,
but
for
the
knowledge
that
Herbert
must
soon
come
back
.
<EOS>
once
,
I
actually
do
start
out
of
bed
in
the
night
,
and
begin
to
dress
myself
in
my
bad
clothe
,
hurriedly
intend
to
leave
him
there
with
everything
else
I
possess
,
and
enlist
for
India
as
a
private
soldier
.
  
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
a
ghost
could
have
be
more
terrible
to
me
,
up
in
those
lonely
room
in
the
long
evening
and
long
night
,
with
the
wind
and
the
rain
always
rush
by
.
<EOS>
a
ghost
could
not
have
be
take
and
hang
on
my
account
,
and
the
consideration
that
he
could
be
,
and
the
dread
that
he
would
be
,
be
no
small
addition
to
my
horror
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
not
asleep
,
or
play
a
complicated
kind
of
Patience
with
a
ragged
pack
of
card
of
his
own
---
a
game
that
I
never
see
before
or
since
,
and
in
which
he
record
his
winning
by
stick
his
jack
-
knife
into
the
table
---
when
he
be
not
engage
in
either
of
these
pursuit
,
he
would
ask
me
to
read
to
him
---
"
foreign
language
,
dear
boy
!
"
<EOS>
while
I
comply
,
he
,
not
comprehend
a
single
word
,
would
stand
before
the
fire
survey
me
with
the
air
of
an
Exhibitor
,
and
I
would
see
him
,
between
the
finger
of
the
hand
with
which
I
shade
my
face
,
appeal
in
dumb
show
to
the
furniture
to
take
notice
of
my
proficiency
.
<EOS>
the
imaginary
student
pursue
by
the
misshapen
creature
he
have
impiously
make
,
be
not
more
wretched
than
I
,
pursue
by
the
creature
who
have
make
me
,
and
recoil
from
him
with
a
strong
repulsion
,
the
more
he
admire
me
and
the
fonder
he
be
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
write
of
<EOS>
,
I
be
sensible
,
as
if
it
have
last
a
year
.
<EOS>
It
last
about
five
day

<EOS>
expect
Herbert
all
the
time

I

not
go
out

except
when
I
take
Provis
for
an
airing
after
dark

<EOS>
at
length
,
one
evening
when
dinner
be
over

I
have
drop
into
a
slumber
quite
worn
out

for
my
night
have
be
agitate
and
my
rest
break
by
fearful
dream

I
be
rouse
by
the
welcome
footstep
on
the
staircase

<EOS>
provi
,
who
have
be
asleep
too

stagger
up
at
the
noise
I
make

in

instant

shine
in

Chapter
41
 
<EOS>
in
vain
should
I
attempt
to
describe
the
astonishment
and
disquiet
of
Herbert
,
when
he
and
I
and
Provis
sit
down
before
the
fire
,
and
I
recount
the
whole
of
the
secret
.
<EOS>
enough
,
that
I
see
my
own
feeling
reflect
in
Herbert
's
face
,
and
,
not
least
among
them
,
my
repugnance
towards
the
man
who
have
do
so
much
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
what
would
alone
have
set
a
division
between
that
man
and
us
,
if
there
have
be
no
other
divide
circumstance
,
be
his
triumph
in
my
story
.
<EOS>
save
his
troublesome
sense
of
have
be
"
low
"
on
one
occasion
since
his
return
---
on
which
point
he
begin
to
hold
forth
to
Herbert
,
the
moment
my
revelation
be
finish
---
he
have
no
perception
of
the
possibility
of
my
find
any
fault
with
my
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
His
boast
that
he
have
make
me
a
gentleman
,
and
that
he
have
come
to
see
me
support
the
character
on
his
ample
resource
,
be
make
for
me
quite
as
much
as
for
himself
;
and
that
it
be
a
highly
agreeable
boast
to
both
of
us
,
and
that
we
must
both
be
very
proud
of
it
,
be
a
conclusion
quite
establish
in
his
own
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
though
,
look'ee
here

Pip
's
comrade

"
he
say
to
Herbert
,
after
have
discourse
for
some
time
,
"
I
know
very
well
that
once
since
I

for
half
a

I

I

I

<EOS>
Herbert
say
,
"
certainly
,

but
look
as
if
there
be
no
specific
consolation
in
this
,

remain
perplex
and
dismay

<EOS>
We
be
anxious
for
the
time
when

would
go
to
his
lodging
,
and
leave
us
together
,
but
he
be
evidently
jealous
of
leave
us
together
,
and
sit
late
.
<EOS>
It
be
midnight
before
I
take
him
round
to
essex
-
street
,
and
see
him
safely
in
at
his
own
dark
door
.
<EOS>
when
it
close
upon
him
,
I
experience
the
first
moment
of
relief
I
have
know
since
the
night
of
his
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
never
quite
free
from
an
uneasy
remembrance
of
the
man
on
the
stair
,
I
have
always
look
about
me
in
take
my
guest
out
after
dark
,
and
in
bring
him
back
;
and
I
look
about
me
now
.
<EOS>
difficult
as
it
be
in
a
large
city
to
avoid
the
suspicion
of
be
watch
,
when
the
mind
be
conscious
of
danger
in
that
regard
,
I
could
not
persuade
myself
that
any
of
the
people
within
sight
care
about
my
movement
.
<EOS>
the
few
who
be
pass
,
pass
on
their
several
way
,
and
the
street
be
empty
when
I
turn
back
into
the
Temple
.
<EOS>
nobody
have
come
out
at
the
gate
with
us
,
nobody
go
in
at
the
gate
with
me
.
<EOS>
as
I
cross
by
the
fountain
,
I
see
his
lighted
back
window
look
bright
and
quiet
,
and
,
when
I
stand
for
a
few
moment
in
the
doorway
of
the
building
where
I
live
,
before
go
up
the
stair
,
garden
-
court
be
as
still
and
lifeless
as
the
staircase
be
when
I
ascend
it
.
  
<EOS>
Herbert
receive
me
with
open
arm
,
and
I
have
never
feel
before
,
so
blessedly
,
what
it
be
to
have
a
friend
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
speak
some
sound
word
of
sympathy
and
encouragement
,
we
sit
down
to
consider
the
question
,
what
be
to
be
do
?
  
<EOS>
the
chair
that
Provis
have
occupy
still
remain
where
it
have
stand
---
for
he
have
a
barrack
way
with
him
of
hang
about
one
spot
,
in
one
unsettled
manner
,
and
go
through
one
round
of
observance
with
his
pipe
and
his
negro
-
head
and
his
jack
-
knife
and
his
pack
of
card
,
and
what
not
,
as
if
it
be
all
put
down
for
him
on
a
slate
---
I
say
,
his
chair
remain
where
it
have
stand
,
Herbert
unconsciously
take
it
,
but
next
moment
start
out
of
it
,
push
it
away
,
and
take
another
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
occasion
to
say
,
after
that
,
that
he
have
conceive
an
aversion
for
my
patron
,
neither
have
I
occasion
to
confess
my
own
.
<EOS>
We
interchange
that
confidence
without
shape
a
syllable
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
"
say
I
to
Herbert
,
when
he
be
safe
in
another
chair
,
"
what
be
to
be
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
poor
dear
Handel
,
"
he
reply
,
hold
his
head
,
"
I
be
too
stunned
to
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
be
I
,
Herbert
,
when
the
blow
first
fall
.
<EOS>
still
,
something
must
be
do
.
<EOS>
He
be
intent
upon
various
new
expense
---
horse
,
and
carriage
,
and
lavish
appearance
of
all
kind
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
stop
somehow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
you
can
not
accept
---
"
  
"
how
can
I
?
<EOS>
"
I
interpose
,
as
Herbert
pause
.
<EOS>
"
think
of
him
!
<EOS>
look
at
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
an
involuntary
shudder
pass
over
both
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
yet
I
be
afraid
the
dreadful
truth
be
,
Herbert
,
that
he
be
attach
to
me
,
strongly
attach
to
me
.
<EOS>
be
there
ever
such
a
fate
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
poor
dear
Handel
,
"
Herbert
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
after
all
,
stop
short
here
,
never
take
another
penny
from
him
,
think
what
I
owe
him
already
!
<EOS>
then
again
:
I
be
heavily
in
debt
---
very
heavily
for
me
,
who
have
now
no
expectation
---
and
I
have
be
breed
to
no
calling
,
and
I
be
fit
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
well
!
"
<EOS>
Herbert
remonstrate
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
say
fit
for
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
I
fit
for
?
<EOS>
I
know
only
one
thing
that
I
be
fit
for
,
and
that
be
,
to
go
for
a
soldier
.
<EOS>
and
I
may
have
go
,
my
dear
Herbert
,
but
for
the
prospect
of
take
counsel
with
your
friendship
and
affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
I
break
down
there
:
<EOS>
and
of
course
Herbert
,
beyond
seize
a
warm
grip
of
my
hand
,
pretend
not
to
know
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
anyhow
,
my
dear
Handel
,
"
say
he
presently
,
"
soldier
will
not
do
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
renounce
this
patronage
and
these
favour
,
I
suppose
you
would
do
so
with
some
faint
hope
of
one
day
repay
what
you
have
already
have
.
<EOS>
not
very
strong
,
that
hope
,
if
you
go
soldier
!
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
absurd
.
<EOS>
You
would
be
infinitely
well
in
Clarriker
's
house
,
small
as
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
work
up
towards
a
partnership
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
He
little
suspect
with
whose
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
another
question
,
"
say
Herbert
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
an
ignorant
determined
man
,
who
have
long
have
one
fix
idea
.
<EOS>
More
than
that
,
he
seem
to
me
(
I
may
misjudge
him
)
to
be
a
man
of
a
desperate
and
fierce
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
be
,
"
I
return
.
"
<EOS>
let
me
tell
you
what
evidence
I
have
see
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
tell
him
what
I
have
not
mention
in
my
narrative
;
of
that
encounter
with
the
other
convict
.
  
<EOS>
"
see
,
then
,
"
say
Herbert
;
"
think
of
this
!
<EOS>
He
come
here
at
the
peril
of
his
life
,
for
the
realization
of
his
fix
idea
.
<EOS>
in
the
moment
of
realization
,
after
all
his
toil
and
waiting
,
you
cut
the
ground
from
under
his
foot
,
destroy
his
idea
,
and
make
his
gain
wormless
to
him
.
<EOS>
do
you
see
nothing
that
he
may
do
,
under
the
disappointment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
it
,
Herbert
,
and
dream
of
it
,
ever
since
the
fatal
night
of
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
in
my
thought
so
distinctly
,
as
his
put
himself
in
the
way
of
be
take
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
may
rely
upon
it
,
"
say
Herbert
,
"
that
there
would
be
great
danger
of
his
do
it
.
<EOS>
that
be
his
power
over
you
as
long
as
he
remain
in
England
,
and
that
would
be
his
reckless
course
if
you
forsook
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
strike
by
the
horror
of
this
idea
,
which
have
weigh
upon
me
from
the
first
,
and
the
working
out
of
which
would
make
me
regard
myself
,
in
some
sort
,
as
his
murderer
,
that
I
could
not
rest
in
my
chair
but
begin
pace
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
I
say
to
Herbert
,
meanwhile
,
that
even
if
provi
be
recognize
and
take
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
I
should
be
wretche
as
the
cause
,
however
innocently
.
<EOS>
yes
;
even
though
I
be
so
wretched
in
have
him
at
large
and
near
me
,
and
even
though
I
would
far
far
rather
have
work
at
the
forge
all
the
day
of
my
life
than
I
would
ever
have
come
to
this
!
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
raving
off
the
question
,
what
be
to
be
do
?
  
<EOS>
"
the
first
and
the
main
thing
to
be
do
,
"
say
Herbert
,
"
be
to
get
him
out
of
England
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
go
with
him
,
and
then
he
may
be
induce
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
get
him
where
I
will
,
could
I
prevent
his
come
back

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
Handel
,
be
it
not
obvious
that
with
Newgate
in
the
next
street
,
there
must
be
far
great
hazard
in
your
break
your
mind
to
him
and
make
him
reckless
,
here
,
than
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
if
a
pretext
to
get
him
away
could
be
make
out
of
that
other
convict

or
out
of
anything
else
in
his
life

now

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

there
,
again
!
"
say
I
,
stop
before
Herbert

with
my
open
hand
hold
out
as
if
they
contain
the
desperation
of
the
case
.
<EOS>

I
know
nothing
of
his
life

<EOS>
It
have
almost
make
me
mad
to
sit
here
of
a
night
and
see
him
before
me
,
so
bind
up
with
my
fortune
and
misfortune
,
and
yet
so
unknown
to
me

as
the
miserable
wretch
who
terrify
me
two
day
in
my
childhood
!

<EOS>
Herbert
get
up
,
and
link
his
arm
in
mine
,
and
we
slowly
walk
to
and
fro
together
,
study
the
carpet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Handel
,
"
say
Herbert
,
stop
,
"
you
feel
convinced
that
you
can
take
no
further
benefit
from
him
;
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
fully
.
<EOS>
surely
you
would
,
too
,
if
you
be
in
my

you
feel
convinced

with

<EOS>
"
Herbert
,
can
you
ask
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
you
have
,
and
be
bind
to
have
,
that
tenderness
for

have
risk
on
your
account
,
that
you
must
save
him
,
if
possible

from
throw
it
away

<EOS>
then
you
must
get
him
out
of
England
before
you
stir
a
finger
to
extricate
yourself

<EOS>
that
do
,
extricate
yourself
,
in
Heaven
's

we
will
see
it
out
together

old
boy

<EOS>
It
be
a
comfort
to
shake
hand
upon
it
,
and
walk
up
and
down
again
,
with
only
that
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Herbert
,
"
say
I
,
"
with
reference
to
gain
some
knowledge
of
his
history
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
way
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
I
must
ask
him
point
-
blank
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
ask
him
,
"
say
Herbert
,
"
when
we
sit
at
breakfast
in
the
morning

"
for
,
he
have
say
,
on
take

unrefreshed

waking

I
never
lose
that
fear

<EOS>
He
come
round
at
the
appoint
time
,
take
out
his
jack

knife
,

sit
down
to
his
meal

He
be
full

out
strong

urge
me
to
begin
speedily
upon
the
pocket

book

which
he
have
leave
in
my
possession

<EOS>
He
consider
the
chamber
and
his
own
lodging
as
temporary
residence
,
and
advise
me
to
look
out
at
once
for
a
"
fashionable
crib

near
Hyde
Park

in
which
he
could
have

a
shake

when
he
have
make
an
end
of
his
breakfast
,
and
be
wipe
his
knife
on
his
leg

I
say
to
him
,
without
a
word
of
preface
:
  
<EOS>
"
after
you
be

I
tell

We
want
to
know
something

about

be
strange

know
no

particularly
you

I
be
able

tell
last

He
take
out
his
black
pipe

go

head

when
,
look
at
the
tangle
of
tobacco
in

he
seem
to
think
it
may
perplex
the

He
put
it
back
again

stick
his

in
a
button

hole
of
his
coat

spread
a

on

all

He

there
be

He
be

<EOS>
Him

they
would

Compeyson
bet

game

he
would
have

so
,
Arthur
be

no
communication
,
"
and
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
so
miserable
poor
,
that
I
sell
all
the
clothe
I
have
,
except
what
hang
on
my
back
,
<EOS>
afore
I
could
get
Jaggers
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
we
be
put
in
the
dock
,
I
notice
first
of
all
what
a
gentleman
Compeyson
look
,
wi
'
his
curly
hair
and
his
black
clothe
and
his
white
pocket
-
handkercher
,
and
what
a
common
sort
of
a
wretch
I
look
.
<EOS>
when
the
prosecution
open
and
the
evidence
be
put
short
,
aforehand
<EOS>
,
I
notice
how
heavy
it
all
bear
on
me
,
and
how
light
on
him
.
<EOS>
when
the
evidence
be
giv
in
the
box
,
I
notice
how
it
be
always
me
that
have
come
for'ard
,
and
could
be
swear
to
,
how
it
be
always
me
that
the
money
have
be
pay
to
<EOS>
,
how
it
be
always
me
that
have
seem
to
work
the
thing
and
get
the
profit
.
<EOS>
but
,
when
the
defence
come
on
,
then
I
see
the
plan
plainer
;
for
,
say
the
counsellor
for
Compeyson
,
"
<EOS>
My
lord
and
gentleman
,
here
you
have
afore
you
,
side
by
side
,
two
person
as
your
eye
can
separate
wide
;
<EOS>
one
,
the
young
,
well
bring
up
,
who
will
be
speak
to
as
such
;
one
,
the
elder
,
ill
bring
up
,
who
will
be
speak
to
as
such
;
one
,
the
young
,
seldom
if
ever
see
in
these
here
transaction
,
and
only
suspect
;
t'other
,
the
elder
,
always
see
in
'em
and
always
wi
'
his
guilt
bring
home
.
<EOS>
Can
you
doubt
,
if
there
be
but
one
in
it
,
which
be
the
one
,
and
,
if
there
be
two
in
it
,
which
be
much
the
bad
one
?
"
<EOS>
and
such
-
like
.
<EOS>
and
when
it
come
to
character
,
warn't
it
<EOS>
Compeyson
<EOS>
as
have
be
to
the
school
,
and
warn't
it
<EOS>
his
schoolfellow
as
be
in
this
position
and
in
that
,
and
warn't
it
<EOS>
him
as
have
be
know'd
by
witness
in
such
club
and
society
,
and
nowt
to
his
disadvantage
?
<EOS>
and
warn't
it
<EOS>
me
as
have
be
try
afore
,
and
as
have
be
know'd
up
hill
and
down
dale
in
Bridewells
and
Lock
-
Ups
?
<EOS>
and
when
it
come
to
speech
-
making
,
warn't
it
<EOS>
Compeyson
as
could
speak
to
'em
wi
'
his
face
drop
every
now
and
then
into
his
white
pocket
-
handkercher---
ah
!
<EOS>
and
wi
'
verse
in
his
speech
,
too
---
and
warn't
it
me
as
could
only
say
,
"
gentleman
,
this
man
at
my
side
be
a
most
precious
rascal
"
?
<EOS>
and
when
the
verdict
come
,
warn't
it
<EOS>
Compeyson
as
be
recommend
to
mercy
on
account
of
good
character
and
bad
company
,
and
give
up
all
the
information
he
could
agen
me
,
and
warn't
it
me
as
get
never
a
word
but
guilty
?
<EOS>
and
when
I
say
to
Compeyson
,
"
once
out
of
this
court
,
I
will
smash
that
face
of
yourn
!
"
<EOS>
be
not
it
Compeyson
as
pray
the
judge
to
be
protect
,
and
get
two
turnkey
stand
<EOS>
betwixt
us
?
<EOS>
and
when
we
be
sentence
,
be
not
it
him
as
get
seven
year
,
and
me
fourteen
,
and
be
not
it
him
as
the
Judge
be
sorry
for
,
because
he
may
a
done
so
well
,
and
be
not
it
me
as
the
Judge
perceive
to
be
a
old
offender
of
wiolent
passion
,
likely
to
come
to
bad
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
work
himself
into
a
state
of
great
excitement
,
but
he
check
it
,
take
two
or
three
short
breath
,
swallow
as
often
,
and
stretch
out
his
hand
towards
me
say
,
in
a
reassuring
manner
,
"
I
be
not
a
go
to
be
low
,
dear
boy
!
  
<EOS>
He
have
so
heat
himself
that
he
take
out
his
handkerchief
and
wipe
his
face
and
head
and
neck
and
hand
,
before
he
could
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
say
to
Compeyson
that
I
would
smash
that
face
of
his
,
and
I
swear
Lord
smash
mine
!
<EOS>
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
We
be
in
the
same
prison
-
ship
,
but
I
could
not
get
at
him
for
long
,
though
I
try
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
come
behind
him
and
hit
him
on
the
cheek
to
turn
him
round
and
get
a
smashing
one
at
him
,
when
I
be
see
and
seize
.
<EOS>
the
black
-
hole
of
that
ship
warn't
a
strong
one
,
to
a
judge
of
black
-
hole
that
could
swim
and
dive
.
<EOS>
I
escape
to
the
shore
,
and
I
be
a
hiding
among
the
grave
there
,
envy
them
as
be
in
'em
and
all
over
,
when
I
first
see
my
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
regard
me
with
a
look
of
affection
that
make
him
almost
abhorrent
to
me
again
,
though
I
have
feel
great
pity
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
by
my
boy
,
I
be
giv
to
understand
as
Compeyson
be
out
on
them
marshe
too
.
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
,
I
half
believe
he
escape
in
his
terror
,
to
get
quit
of
me
,
not
know
it
be
me
as
have
get
ashore
.
<EOS>
I
hunt
him
down
.
<EOS>
I
smash
his
face
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
"
say
I
,
"
as
the
bad
thing
I
can
do
,
care
nothing
for
myself
,
I
will
drag
you
back
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
would
have
swum
off
,
tow
him
by
the
hair
,
if
it
have
come
to
that
,
and
I
would
a
got
him
aboard
without
the
soldier
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
would
much
the
good
of
it
to
the
last
---
his
character
be
so
good
.
<EOS>
He
have
escape
when
he
be
make
half
-
wild
by
me
and
my
murderous
intention
;
and
his
punishment
be
light
.
<EOS>
I
be
put
in
iron
,
bring
to
trial
again
,
and
send
for
life
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
stop
for
life
,
dear
boy
and
Pip
's
comrade
,
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
wipe
himself
again
,
as
he
have
do
before
,
and
then
slowly
take
his
tangle
of
tobacco
from
his
pocket
,
and
pluck
his
pipe
from
his
button
-
hole
,
and
slowly
fill
it
,
and
begin
to
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
dead
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
after
a
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
who
dead
,
dear
boy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Compeyson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
hope
I
be
,
if
he
be
alive
,
you
may
be
sure
,
"
with
a
fierce
look
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
heerd
no
more
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Herbert
have
be
write
with
his
pencil
in
the
cover
of
a
book
.
<EOS>
He
softly
push
the
book
over
to
me
,
as
Provis
stand
smoke
with
his
eye
on
the
fire
,
and
I
read
in
it
:
  
<EOS>
"
Young
Havisham
's
name
be
Arthur
.
<EOS>
Compeyson
be
the
man
who
profess
to
be
Miss
Havisham
's
lover
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
shut
the
book
and
nod
slightly
to
Herbert
,
and
put
the
book
by
;
but
we
neither
of
us
say
anything
,
and
both
look
at
Provis
as
he
stand
smoke
by
the
fire
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
43
 
why
<EOS>
should
I
pause
to
ask
how
much
of
my
shrinking
from
Provis
may
be
trace
to
Estella
?
<EOS>
why
should
I
loiter
on
my
road
,
to
compare
the
state
of
mind
in
which
I
have
try
to
rid
myself
of
the
stain
of
the
prison
before
meet
her
at
the
coach
-
office
,
with
the
state
of
mind
in
which
I
now
reflect
on
the
abyss
between
Estella
in
her
pride
and
beauty
,
and
the
return
transport
whom
I
harbour
?
<EOS>
the
road
would
be
none
the
smooth
for
it
,
the
end
would
be
none
the
well
for
it
,
he
would
not
be
help
,
nor
I
extenuate
.
  
<EOS>
a
new
fear
have
be
engender
in
my
mind
by
his
narrative
;
or
rather
,
his
narrative
have
give
form
and
purpose
to
the
fear
that
be
already
there
.
<EOS>
if
Compeyson
be
alive
and
should
discover
his
return
,
I
could
hardly
doubt
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
that
,
Compeyson
stand
in
mortal
fear
of
him
,
neither
of
the
two
could
know
much
well
than
I
;
and
that
,
any
such
man
as
that
man
have
be
describe
to
be
,
would
hesitate
to
release
himself
for
good
from
a
dread
enemy
by
the
safe
mean
of
become
an
informer
,
be
scarcely
to
be
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
never
have
I
breathe
,
and
never
would
I
breathe
---
or
<EOS>
so
I
resolve
---
<EOS>
a
word
of
Estella
to
Provis
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
say
to
Herbert
that
before
I
could
go
abroad
,
I
must
see
both
Estella
and
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
this
be
when
we
be
leave
alone
on
the
night
of
the
day
when
Provis
tell
us
his
story
.
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
go
out
to
Richmond
next
day
,
and
I
go
.
  
<EOS>
on
my
present
myself
at
Mrs
Brandley
's
,
Estella
's
maid
be
call
to
tell
me
that
Estella
have
go
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
where
?
<EOS>
to
Satis
House
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
not
as
usual
,
I
say
,
for
she
have
never
yet
go
there
without
me
;
when
be
she
come
back
?
<EOS>
there
be
an
air
of
reservation
in
the
answer
which
increase
my
perplexity
,
and
the
answer
be
,
that
her
maid
believe
she
be
only
come
back
at
all
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
I
could
make
nothing
of
this
,
except
that
it
be
mean
that
I
should
make
nothing
of
it
,
and
I
go
home
again
in
complete
discomfiture
.
  
<EOS>
another
night
-
consultation
with
Herbert
after
Provis
be
go
home
<EOS>
(
I
always
take
him
home
,
and
always
look
well
about
me
)
,
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
nothing
should
be
say
about
go
abroad
until
I
come
back
from
Miss
Havisham
's
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
Herbert
and
I
be
to
consider
separately
what
it
would
be
good
to
say
;
whether
we
should
devise
any
pretence
of
be
afraid
that
he
be
under
suspicious
observation
;
or
whether
I
,
who
have
never
yet
be
abroad
,
should
propose
an
expedition
.
<EOS>
We
both
know
that
I
have
but
to
propose
anything
,
and
he
would
consent
.
<EOS>
We
agree
that
his
remain
many
day
in
his
present
hazard
be
not
to
be
think
of
.
  
<EOS>
next
day
,
I
have
the
meanness
to
feign
that
I
be
under
a
bind
promise
to
go
down
to
Joe
;
but
I
be
capable
of
almost
any
meanness
towards
Joe
or
his
name
.
<EOS>
Provis
be
to
be
strictly
careful
while
I
be
go
,
and
Herbert
be
to
take
the
charge
of
him
that
I
have
take
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
be
absent
only
one
night
,
and
,
on
my
return
,
the
gratification
of
his
impatience
for
my
starting
as
a
gentleman
on
a
great
scale
,
be
to
be
begin
.
<EOS>
It
occur
to
me
then
,
and
as
I
afterwards
find
to
Herbert
also
,
that
he
may
be
best
get
away
across
the
water
,
on
that
pretence
---
as
,
to
make
purchase
,
or
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
clear
the
way
for
my
expedition
to
Miss
Havisham
's
,
I
set
off
by
the
early
morning
coach
before
it
be
yet
light
,
and
be
out
on
the
open
country
-
road
when
the
day
come
creep
on
,
halt
and
whimpering
and
shivering
,
and
wrap
in
patch
of
cloud
and
rag
of
mist
,
like
a
beggar
.
<EOS>
when
we
drive
up
to
the
Blue
Boar
after
a
drizzly
ride
,
whom
should
I
see
come
out
under
the
gateway
,
toothpick
in
hand
,
to
look
at
the
coach
,
but
Bentley
Drummle
!
  
<EOS>
as
he
pretend
not
to
see
me
,
I
pretend
not
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
lame
pretence
on
both
side
;
the
lamer
,
because
we
both
go
into
the
coffee
-
room
,
where
he
have
just
finish
his
breakfast
,
and
where
I
order
mine
.
<EOS>
It
be
poisonous
to
me
to
see
him
in
the
town
,
for
I
very
well
know
why
he
have
come
there
.
  
<EOS>
pretend
to
read
a
smeary
newspaper
long
out
of
date
,
which
have
nothing
half
so
legible
in
its
local
news
,
as
the
foreign
matter
of
coffee
,
pickle
,
fish
-
sauce
,
gravy
,
melted
butter
,
and
wine
,
with
which
it
be
sprinkle
all
over
,
as
if
it
have
take
the
measle
in
a
highly
irregular
form
,
I
sit
at
my
table
while
he
stand
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
by
degree
it
become
an
enormous
injury
to
me
that
he
stand
before
the
fire
,
and
I
get
up
,
determine
to
have
my
share
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
put
my
hand
behind
his
leg
for
the
poker
when
I
go
up
to
the
fire
-
place
to
stir
the
fire
,
but
still
pretend
not
to
know
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
this
a
cut
?
"
 
say
Mr
Drummle
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
I
,
poker
in
hand
;
"
it
be
you
,
be
it
?
<EOS>
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
I
be
wonder
who
it
be
,
who
keep
the
fire
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
,
I
poke
tremendously
,
and
have
do
so
,
plant
myself
side
by
side
with
Mr
Drummle
,
my
shoulder
square
and
my
back
to
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
just
come
down
?
"
say
Mr
Drummle
,
edge
me
a
little
away
with
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I
,
edge
 
<EOS>
\
him
<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
a
little
away
with
 
\
<EOS>
my
\
 
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
beastly
place
,
"
say
Drummle
.
<EOS>
---
"
Your
part
of
the
country
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
assent
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
it
be
very
like
your
shropshire
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
in
the
least
like
it
,
"
say

<EOS>
I
feel
here
,
through
a
tingling
in
my
blood
,
that
if
Mr
Drummle
's
shoulder
have
claim
another
hair
's
breadth
of
room
,
I
should
have
jerk
him
into
the
window
;
equally
,
that
if
my
own
shoulder
have
urge
a
similar
claim
,
Mr
Drummle
would
have
jerk
me
into
the
near
box

He
whistle

Drummle
glance
at

with
an
insolent
triumph
on
his

jowled
face
that
cut
me
to
the
heart
,
dull
as
he
be
,
and
so
exasperate
me
,
that
I
feel
inclined
to
take
him
in
my
arm
(
as
the
robber
in
the
story
-
book
be
say
to
have
take
the
old

)
,
and
seat
him
on
the

<EOS>
one
thing
be
manifest
to
both

that
be
,
that
until
relief
come

neither

<EOS>
there
we
stand

well
square
up

shoulder

<EOS>
the

be
that

yes

very

They

You

<EOS>
"
Mr

"
say
I
,
"
you
be
not
competent
to
give
advice
on

<EOS>
when
I
lose
my
temper
(
not
that
I
admit
have
do
so
on

,
I
do
not
throw
glass

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do

say
Drummle
.
  
<EOS>
again
glance
at
him
once
or
twice
,
in
an
increased
state
of
smoulder
ferocity
,
I
say
:
  
"
Mr
Drummle
,
I
do
not
seek
this
conversation
,
and
I
do
not

it
an
agreeable
one

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
it
be
not

say
he
,
superciliously
over
his
shoulder
;
"
I
do
not
think
anything
about
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
therefore
,
"
I
go
on

with

I
will
suggest
that

hold
no
kind
of
communication
in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
my
opinion

"
say
Drummle
,
"
and
what
I
should
have
suggest
myself
,
or
do
---
more
likely
---
without
suggest

<EOS>
but
do
not
lose
your
temper

<EOS>
have
not
you
lose
enough
without
that

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean

<EOS>
"
  
"
Wai

Drummle

by
way
of
answer
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
waiter
reappear
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
here
,
you

<EOS>
You
quite
understand
that

that
I

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
quite
so

"
  
<EOS>
when
the
waiter
have
feel
my
fast
cool
tea
-
pot
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
and
have
look
imploringly
at
me
,
and
have
go
out
,
Drummle
,
careful
not
to
move
the
shoulder
next
me
,
take
a
cigar
from
his
pocket
and
bit
the
end
off
,
but
show
no
sign
of
stir
.
<EOS>
choke
and
boil
as
I
be
,
I
feel
that
we
could
not
go
a
word
further
,
without
introduce
Estella
's
name
,
which
I
could
not
endure
to
hear
him
utter
;
and
therefore
I
look
stonily
at
the
opposite
wall
,
as
if
there
be
no
one
present
,
and
force
myself
to
silence
.
<EOS>
how
long
we
may
have
remain
in
this
ridiculous
position
it
be
impossible
to
say
,
but
for
the
incursion
of
three
thriving
farmer
---
lay
on
by
the
waiter
,
I
think
---
who
come
into
the
coffee

room
unbutton
their
great

coat
and
rub
their
hand
,
and
before
whom
,
as
they
charge
at
the
fire
,
we
be
oblige
to
give
way
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
him
through
the
window
,
seize
his
horse
's
mane
,
and
mount
in
his
blunder
brutal
manner
,
and
sidle
and
back
away
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
go
,
when
he
come
back
,
call
for
a
light
for
the
cigar
in
his
mouth
,
which
he
have
forget

<EOS>
a
man
in

appear
with
what
be
want

I
could
not
have
say
from
where
:
whether
from
the
inn
yard
,
or
the
street
,
or
where
not
---
and
as
Drummle
lean
down
from
the
saddle
and
light
his
cigar
and
laugh
,
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
towards
the
coffee
-
room
window
,
the
slouch
shoulder
and
ragged
hair
of
this
man
,
whose
back
be
towards
me
,
remind
me
of
Orlick
.
  
<EOS>
too
heavily
out
of
sort
to
care
much
at
the
time
whether
it
be
he
or
no
,
or
after
all
to
touch
the
breakfast
,
I
wash
the
weather
and
the
journey
from
my
face
and
hand
,
and
go
out
to
the
memorable
old
house
that
it

never

never

Chapter

in
the
room
where
the
dressing

table
stand
,
and
<EOS>
where
the
wax
candle
burn
on
the

I
find
Miss

Miss

<EOS>
They
both
raise
their
eye
as
I
go
in

and
both
see
an
alteration
in
me

I
derive
that

pause
a
moment
in
her
knitting
with
her
eye
upon
me

and
then
go
on

I
fancy
that
I
read
in
the
action
of
her
finger
,
as
plainly
as
if
she
have
tell
me
in
the
dumb

Miss

continue
to
look
steadily
at

I
could
see
in
the
action

as
they
work

good

look
at
me
keenly
for

quietly
:

"
what

you
want
for

only
,

say
I

that
you

They

believe
me

repeat
:

<EOS>
"
I

Miss
Havisham
,
if
you
would
spare
the
money
to
do
my

Herbert

last
service
in

which
from
the
nature

be
do
without

could
show
you
how

the

She
gradually
withdraw
her
eye
from
me

turn
them
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
after
watch
it
for
what
appear
in
the
silence

by
the
light
of
the

waste
candle
to
be
a
long

she
be
rouse
by
the
collapse
of

vacantly

the

incredulous
wonder

the
spectral
figure

all
go

much
be
do

go

seem
of

dark
colour

go
in

hide
myself
among
some
lane

by

path

then
strike
off
to
walk
all
the
way
to
London

for
,
I
have
by
that
time
come
to
myself
so
far
,
as
to
consider
that
I
could
not
go
back
to
the
inn
and
see
Drummle
there
;
that
I
could
not
bear
to
sit
upon
the
coach

be
speak
to

I
could
do
nothing
half
so
good
for
myself

tire
myself
out

It
be
past
midnight
when
I
cross
London
Bridge

pursue
the
narrow
intricacy

the
street

at
that
time
tend
westward
near

Middlesex
shore

readiest
access

side

to

myself

as
it

I
come
in

Whitefriars
gate
after

closed

as
I
be
very
muddy
and
weary

I
do
not
take
it
ill
that
the
night

porter
examine
me
with
much
attention

he
hold
the
gate
a
little
way
open

me
to
pass
in

his

<EOS>
the
messenger
that

it

would
you

it

"
  
<EOS>
much
surprise
by
the

I
take
the
note
.
<EOS>
It
be
direct
to
Philip
Pip

Esquire

and
on
the
top
of
the
superscription
be
the
word
,
"
PLEASE
READ
this

<EOS>
"
I
open
it
,
the
watchman
hold
up
his
light
,
and
read
inside

in
Wemmick

writing
:

<EOS>
Chapter
45
 
turn
from
the
Temple
gate
as
soon
as
I
have
read
the
warning
,
I
make
the
good
of
my
way
to
Fleet
-
street
,
and
there
get
a
late
hackney
chariot
and
drive
to
the
Hummums
in
Covent
Garden
.
<EOS>
in
those
time
a
bed
be
always
to
be
get
there
at
any
hour
of
the
night
,
and
the
chamberlain
,
let
me
in
at
his
ready
wicket
,
light
the
candle
next
in
order
on
his
shelf
,
and
show
me
straight
into
the
bedroom
next
in
order
on
his
list
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sort
of
vault
on
the
ground
floor
at
the
back
,
with
a
despotic
monster
of
a
four
-
post
bedstead
in
it
,
straddle
over
the
whole
place
,
put
one
of
his
arbitrary
leg
into
the
fire
-
place
and
another
into
the
doorway
,
and
squeeze
the
wretched
little
washing
-
stand
in
quite
a
divinely
righteous
manner
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
ask
for
a
night
-
light
,
the
chamberlain
have
bring
me
in
,
before
he
leave
me
,
the
good
old
constitutional
rush
-
light
of
those
virtuous
day
---
an
object
like
the
ghost
of
a
walking
-
cane
,
which
instantly
break
its
back
if
it
be
touch
,
which
nothing
could
ever
be
light
at
,
and
which
be
place
in
solitary
confinement
at
the
bottom
of
a
high
tin
tower
,
perforate
with
round
hole
that
make
a
staringly
wide
-
awake
pattern
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
get
into
bed
,
and
lie
there
footsore
,
weary
,
and
wretched
<EOS>
,
I
find
that
I
could
no
more
close
my
own
eye
than
I
could
close
the
eye
of
this
foolish
Argus
.
<EOS>
and
thus
,
in
the
gloom
and
death
of
the
night
,
we
stare
at
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
doleful
night
!
<EOS>
how
anxious
,
how
dismal
,
how
long
!
<EOS>
there
be
an
inhospitable
smell
in
the
room
,
of
cold
soot
and
hot
dust
;
and
,
as
I
look
up
into
the
corner
of
the
tester
over
my
head
,
I
think
what
a
number
of
blue
-
bottle
fly
from
the
butcher
'
,
and
earwig
from
the
market
,
and
grub
from
the
country
,
must
be
hold
on
up
there
,
lie
by
for
next
summer
.
<EOS>
this
lead
me
to
speculate
whether
any
of
them
ever
tumble
down
,
and
then
I
fancy
that
I
feel
light
fall
on
my
face
---
<EOS>
a
disagreeable
turn
of
thought
,
suggest
other
and
more
objectionable
approach
up
my
back
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
lain
awake
a
little
while
,
those
extraordinary
voice
with
which
silence
teem
,
begin
to
make
themselves
audible
.
<EOS>
the
closet
whisper
,
the
fireplace
sigh
,
<EOS>
the
little
washing
-
stand
tick
,
and
one
guitar
-
string
play
occasionally
in
the
chest
of
drawer
.
<EOS>
at
about
the
same
time
,
the
eye
on
the
wall
acquire
a
new
expression
,
and
in
every
one
of
those
stare
round
I
see
write
,
don't
GO
HOME
.
  
<EOS>
whatever
night
-
fancy
and
night
-
noise
crowd
on
me
,
they
never
ward
off
this
DONT
GO
HOME
.
<EOS>
It
plait
itself
into
whatever
I
think
of
,
as
a
bodily
pain
would
have
do
.
<EOS>
not
long
before
,
I
have
read
in
the
newspaper
,
how
a
gentleman
unknown
have
come
to
the
Hummums
in
the
night
,
and
have
go
to
bed
,
and
have
destroy
himself
,
and
have
be
find
in
the
morning
welter
in
blood
.
<EOS>
It
come
into
my
head
that
he
must
have
occupy
this
very
vault
of
mine
,
and
I
get
out
of
bed
to
assure
myself
that
there
be
no
red
mark
about
;
then
open
the
door
to
look
out
into
the
passage
,
and
cheer
myself
with
the
companionship
of
a
distant
light
,
near
which
I
know
the
chamberlain
to
be
doze
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
time
,
why
I
be
not
to
go
home
,
and
what
have
happen
at
home
,
and
when
I
should
go
home
,
and
whether
Provis
be
safe
at
home
,
be
question
occupy
my
mind
so
busily
,
that
one
may
have
suppose
there
could
be
no
more
room
in
it
for
any
other
theme
.
<EOS>
even
when
I
think
of
Estella
,
and
how
we
have
part
that
day
for
ever
,
and
when
I
recall
all
the
circumstance
of
our
parting
and
all
her
look
and
tone
,
and
the
action
of
her
finger
while
she
knit
---
even
then
I
be
pursue
,
here
and
there
and
everywhere
,
the
caution
do
not
go
home
.
<EOS>
when
at
last
I
doze
,
in
sheer
exhaustion
of
mind
and
body
,
it
become
a
vast
shadowy
verb
which
I
have
to
conjugate
.
<EOS>
imperative
mood
,
present
tense
:
<EOS>
do
not
thou
go
home
,
let
him
not
go
home
,
let
us
not
go
home
,
do
not
ye
<EOS>
or
you
go
home
,
<EOS>
let
not
them
go
home
.
<EOS>
then
,
potentially
:
I
may
not
and
I
can
not
go
home
;
and
I
may
not
,
could
not
,
would
not
,
and
should
not
go
home
;
until
I
feel
that
I
be
go
distract
,
and
roll
over
on
the
pillow
,
and
look
at
the
stare
round
upon
the
wall
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
leave
direction
that
I
be
to
be
call
at
seven
;
for
it
be
plain
that
I
must
see
Wemmick
before
see
any
one
else
,
and
equally
plain
that
this
be
a
case
in
which
his
Walworth
sentiment
,
only
,
could
be
take
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
relief
to
get
out
of
the
room
where
the
night
have
be
so
miserable
,
and
I
need
no
second
knocking
at
the
door
to
startle
me
from
my
uneasy
bed
.
  
<EOS>
the
Castle
battlement
arise
upon
my
view
at
eight
o'clock
.
<EOS>
the
little
servant
happen
to
be
enter
the
fortress
with
two
hot
roll
,
I
pass
through
the
postern
and
cross
the
drawbridge
,
in
her
company
,
and
so
come
without
announcement
into
the
presence
of
Wemmick
as
he
be
make
tea
for
himself
and
the
aged
.
<EOS>
an
open
door
afford
a
perspective
view
of
the
aged
in
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
,
Mr
Pip
!
"
 
say
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
come
home
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
"
I
return
;
"
but
I
do
not
go
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
right
,
"
say
he
,
rub
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
leave
a
note
for
you
at
each
of
the
Temple
gate
,
on
the
chance
.
<EOS>
which
gate
do
you
come
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
round
to
the
other
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
destroy
the
note
,
"
say
Wemmick
;
<EOS>
"
it
be
a
good
rule
never
to
leave
documentary
evidence
if
you
can
help
it
,
because
you
do
not
know
when
it
may
be
put
in
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
take
a
liberty
with
you
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
\
<EOS>
Would
\
 
<EOS>
you
mind
toast
this
sausage
for
the
aged
P
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
I
should
be
delighted
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
can
go
about
your
work
,
Mary
Anne

"
say
Wemmick
to
the
little
servant
;
"
which
leave
us
to
ourselves

not

,
Mr
Pip

<EOS>
"
he
add
,
winking
,
as
she
disappear

<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
his
friendship
and
caution
,
and
our
discourse
proceed
in
a
low
tone
,
while
I
toast
the
Aged
's
sausage
<EOS>
and
he
butter
the
crumb
of
the
Aged
's
roll

<EOS>

Mr
Pip

say
Wemmick
,
"
<EOS>
you

We

We

I
cordially
assent

be

already

have
make
some
little
stir

a
good
many

in
watch
his

I
make
quite
a
firework
of
the
Aged

sausage

greatly
discompose
both
my
own
attention

Wemmick

;

Wemmick

evasively

clash
with
official

other
curious

<EOS>
He
take
the
toasting
-
fork
and
sausage
from
me
as
he
speak
,
and
set
forth
the
Aged
's
breakfast
neatly
on
a
little
tray
.
<EOS>
previous
to
place
it
before
him
,
he
go
into
the
Aged
's
room
with
a
clean
white
cloth

tie
the
same
under
the
old
gentleman

chin

prop
him
up
,
and
put
his
nightcap
on
one
side
,
and
give
him
quite
a
rakish
air
.
<EOS>
then
,
he
place
his
breakfast
before
him
with
great
care
,
and
say
,
"
all
right

not
you

Aged
P

to
which
the
cheerful
Aged
reply
,
"
all

John

my

<EOS>
as
there
seem
to
be
a
tacit
understanding
that
the
Aged
be
not
in
a
presentable
state
,
and
be
therefore
to
be
consider
invisible

I
make
a
pretence

be

complete
ignorance

this
watching

reason

to
Wemmick

Wemmick
look
very
serious

I
could
not

of

I
mean
,
I
could

to

first

<EOS>
as
I
see
that
he
be
restrain
by
fealty
to
Little
Britain
from
say
as
much
as
he
could
,
and
as
I
know
with
thankfulness
to
him
how
far
out
of
his
way
he
go
to
say
what
he
do
,
I
could
not
press
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
tell
him
,
after
a
little
meditation
over
the
fire
,
that
I
would
like
to
ask
him
a
question
,
subject
to
his
answering

not
answer
,
as
he
deem
right
,
and
sure
that
his
course
would
be
right
.
<EOS>
He
pause
in
his
breakfast
,
and
cross
his
arm
,
and
pinch
his
shirt
-
sleeve
(
his
notion
of
indoor
comfort
be
to
sit
without
any
coat
)
<EOS>
,
he
nod
to
me
once
,
to
put
my
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
hear
of
a
man
of
bad
character
,
<EOS>
whose
true
name
be
Compeyson
?

<EOS>
He
answer
with
one
other
nod

<EOS>
"
be
he
live

"
  
<EOS>
one
other
nod

<EOS>
"
be
he
in
London

<EOS>
He
give
me
one
other
nod
,
compress
the
post
-
office
exceedingly
,
give
me
one
last
nod
,
and
go
on
with
his
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
question
be
over
;

which
he
emphasize
and
repeat
for
my
guidance

I
come
to
what

what

I
go

safe
to
try
to
get
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
,
too
far
out
of
the
way
at
present
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pip
,
I
will
tell
you
something
.
<EOS>
under
exist
circumstance
there
be
no
place
like
a
great
city
when
you
be
once
in
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
break
cover
too
soon
.
<EOS>
lie
close
.
<EOS>
wait
till
thing
slacken
,
before
you
try
the
open
,
even
for
foreign
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
his
valuable
advice
,
and
ask
him
what
Herbert
have
do
?
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Herbert
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
after
be
all
of
a
heap
for
half
an
hour
,
strike
out
a
plan
.
<EOS>
He
mention
to
me
as
a
secret
,
that
he
be
court
a
young
lady
who
have
,
as
no
doubt
you
be
aware
,
<EOS>
a
bedridden
Pennsylvania
<EOS>
which
Pa
,
have
be
in
the
Purser
line
of
life
,
lie
a
-
bed
in
a
bow
-
window
where
he
can
see
the
ship
sail
up
and
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
You
be
acquaint
with
the
young
lady
,
most
probably
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
personally
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
she
have
object
to
me
as
an
expensive
companion
who
do
Herbert
<EOS>
no
good
,
and
that
,
when
Herbert
have
first
propose
to
present
me
to
her
,
she
have
receive
the
proposal
with
such
very
moderate
warmth
,
that
Herbert
have
feel
himself
oblige
to
confide
the
state
of
the
case
to
me
,
with
a
view
to
the
lapse
of
a
little
time
before
I
make
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
begin
to
advance
Herbert
's
prospect
by
stealth
,
I
have
be
able
to
bear
this
with
cheerful
philosophy
;
he
and
his
affiance
,
for
their
part
,
have
naturally
not
be
very
anxious
to
introduce
a
third
person
into
their
interview
;
and
thus
,
although
I
be
assure
that
I
have
rise
in
Clara
's
esteem
,
and
although
the
young
lady
and
I
have
long
regularly
interchange
message
and
remembrance
by
Herbert
,
I
have
never
see
her
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
not
trouble
Wemmick
with
these
particular
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
house
with
the
bow
-
window
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
be
by
the
river
-
side
,
down
the
Pool
there
between
Limehouse
and
Greenwich
,
and
be
keep
,
it
seem
,
by
a
very
respectable
widow
who
have
a
furnished
upper
floor
to
let
,
Mr
Herbert
put
it
to
me
<EOS>
,
what
do
I
think
of
that
as
a
temporary
tenement
for
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
?
<EOS>
now
,
I
think
very
well
of
it
,
for
three
reason
I
will
give
you
.
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
.
<EOS>
firstly
.
<EOS>
It
be
altogether
out
of
all
your
beat
,
and
be
well
away
from
the
usual
heap
of
street
great
and
small
.
<EOS>
secondly
.
<EOS>
without
go
near
it
yourself
,
you
could
always
hear
of
the
safety
of
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
,
through
Mr
Herbert
.
<EOS>
thirdly
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
and
when
it
may
be
prudent
,
if
you
should
want
to
slip
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
,
on
board
a
foreign
packet
-
boat
,
there
he
be
---
ready
.
"
  
<EOS>
much
comfort
by
these
consideration
,
I
thank
Wemmick
again
and
again
,
and
beg
him
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Mr
Herbert
throw
himself
into
the
business
with
a
will
,
and
by
nine
o'clock
last
night
he
house
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
---
whichever
it
may
be
---
<EOS>
you
and
I
do
not
want
to
know
---
quite
successfully
.
<EOS>
at
the
old
lodging
it
be
understand
that
he
be
summon
to
Dover
,
and
in
fact
he
be
take
down
the
Dover
road
and
corner
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
now
,
another
great
advantage
of
all
this
,
be
,
that
it
be
do
without
you
,
and
when
,
if
any
one
be
concern
himself
about
your
movement
,
you
must
be
know
to
be
ever
so
many
mile
off
and
quite
otherwise
engaged
.
<EOS>
this
divert
suspicion
and
confuse
it
;
and
for
the
same
reason
I
recommend
that
even
if
you
come
back
last
night
,
you
should
not
go
home
.
<EOS>
It
bring
in
more
confusion
,
and
you
want
confusion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Wemmick
,
have
finish
his
breakfast
,
here
look
at
his
watch
,
and
begin
to
get
his
coat
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
Mr
Pip
,
"
say
he
,
with
his
hand
still
in
the
sleeve
,
"
I
have
probably
do
the
most
I
can
do
;
but
if
I
can
ever
do
more
---
from
a
Walworth
point
of
view
,
and
in
a
strictly
private
and
personal
capacity
---
I
shall
be
glad
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
address
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
harm
in
your
go
here
to
-
night
and
see
for
yourself
that
all
be
well
with
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
,
before
you
go
home
---
which
be
another
reason
for
your
not
go
home
last
night
.
<EOS>
but
after
you
have
go
home
,
do
not
go
back
here
.
<EOS>
You
be
very
welcome
,
I
be
sure
,
Mr
Pip
;
"
his
hand
be
now
out
of
his
sleeve
,
and
I
be
shake
them
;
"
and
let
me
finally
impress
one
important
point
upon
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
lay
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
add
in
a
solemn
whisper
:
"
avail
yourself
of
this
evening
to
lay
hold
of
his
portable
property
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
what
may
happen
to
him
.
<EOS>
do
not
let
anything
happen
to
the
portable
property
.
"
  
<EOS>
quite
despairing
of
make
my
mind
clear
to
Wemmick
on
this
point
,
I
forbore
to
try
.
  
<EOS>
"
Time
's
up
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
and
I
must
be
off
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
nothing
more
pressing
to
do
than
to
keep
here
till
dark
,
that
be
what
I
should
advise
.
<EOS>
You
look
very
much
worried
,
and
it
would
do
you
good
to
have
a
perfectly
quiet
day
with
the
aged
<EOS>
---
he
will
be
up
presently
---
and
a
little
bit
of
---
you
remember
the
pig
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>

well

and
a

bit
of

him

<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
that
sausage
you

his

and
he
be
in

do
try
him

if
it

pipe
the
old

from
within

<EOS>
I
soon
fall
asleep
before
Wemmick
's
fire

and
the
aged
and
<EOS>
I
enjoy
one

less
all
day

<EOS>
We
have
loin
of
pork
for
dinner
,
and
green
grow
on
the
estate
,
and
I
nod
at
the
Aged
with
a
good
intention
whenever
I
fail
to
do
it
drowsily
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
quite
dark
,
I
leave
the
Aged
prepare
the
fire
for
toast
;
and
I
infer
from
the
number
of
teacup
,
as
well
as
from
his
glance
at
the
two

eight
o'clock

before
I

into

by
the

<EOS>
all
that

be
unknown
ground
to

,
and
when
I
strike
down
by
the

I
find
that
the
spot
I
want
be
not
where
I
have
suppose
it
to
be
,
and
be
anything
but
easy
to
find
.
<EOS>
It
be
call
Mill
Pond
Bank
,
Chinks

Basin
;
and
I
have
no
other
guide
to
Chinks
's
Basin
than
the
Old
Green
Copper
Rope

walk
.
  
<EOS>
It
matter
not
what
strand
ship
repair
in
dry
dock
<EOS>
I
lose
myself
among
,
what
old
hull
of

,
what
ooze
and
slime

what

how
many

<EOS>
after
several
time
fall
short
of
my
destination
and
as
often
over
-
shoot
it
,
I
come
unexpectedly
round
a
corner
,
upon
Mill
Pond
Bank
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fresh
kind
of
place
,
all
circumstance
consider
,
where
the
wind
from
the
river
have
room
to
turn
itself
round
;
and
there
be
two
or
three
tree
in
it
,
and
there
be
the
stump
of
a
ruin
windmill
,
and
there
be
the
Old
Green
Copper
Rope

walk
---
whose
long
and
narrow
vista
I
could
trace
in
the
moonlight
,
along
a
series
of
wooden
frame
set
in
the
ground
,
that
look
like
superannuated
haymaking
-
rake
which
have
grow
old
and
lose
most
of
their
tooth
.
  
<EOS>
select
from
the
few
queer
house
upon
Mill
Pond
Bank
,
a
house
with
a
wooden
front
and
three
story
of
bow

window
(
not
bay

window
,
which
be
another
thing
)
,
I
look
at
the
plate
upon
the
door
,
and
read
there
,
Mrs
Whimple

<EOS>
that
be
the
name
I
want

an
elderly
woman

a
pleasant
and
thriving
appearance
respond
.
<EOS>
She
be
immediately
depose
,
however
,
by
Herbert
,
who
silently
lead
me
into
the
parlour
and
shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
odd
sensation
to
see
his
very
familiar
face
establish
quite
at
home
in
that
very
unfamiliar
room
and
region
;
and
I
find
myself
look
at
him
,
much
as
I
look
at
the
corner

cupboard
with
the
glass
and
china
,
the
shell
upon

and
the

eager

My

if
you
will
wait

I

<EOS>
I
have
become
aware
of
an
alarming
growling
overhead

and
have
probably
express
the
fact
in
my
countenance

<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
he
be
a
sad
old
rascal

I
have
never

do
not
you
smell
tum

He

always
at

at

say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

"
return
Herbert
,

and
you
may
suppose
how
mild
it
make
his
gout

<EOS>
He
persist
,
too
,
in
keep
all
the
provision
upstairs
in
his
room
,
and
serve
them
out
.
<EOS>
He
keep
them
on
shelf
over
his
head
,
and
 
\
will
\
 
<EOS>
weigh
them
all

<EOS>
His
room
must
be
like
a
chandler
's
shop

"
  
<EOS>
while
he
thus
speak
,
the
growl
noise
become
a
prolonged
roar
,
and
then
die
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
else
can
be
the
consequence
,
"
say
Herbert
,
in
explanation
,
"
if
he

will

cut
the

<EOS>
a
man
with
the
gout
in
his
right
hand

and
everywhere
else

can
not
expect
to
get
through
a
Double
Gloucester
without
hurt
himself

"
  
<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
hurt
himself
very
much
,
for
he
give
another
furious
roar
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
have
Provis
for
an
upper
lodger
be
quite
a
godsend
to
Mrs
Whimple

Herbert

"
for
of
course
people

not
stand
that
noise

Handel

<EOS>
It
be

curious

indeed

remarkably
well
kept

clean

it
be
for
the

to
love
a

never

about

<EOS>
Herbert
have
tell
me
on
former
occasion
,
and
now
remind
me
,
that
he
first
know
Miss
Clara
Barley
when
she
be
complete
her
education
at
an
establishment
at
Hammersmith
,
and
that
on
her
be
recall
home
to

her

he
and
she
have
confide
their
affection
to
the
motherly
Mrs
Whimple

by
whom
it
have
be
foster
and
regulate
with
equal
kindness
and
discretion
,
ever
since
.
<EOS>
It
be
understand
that
nothing
of
a
tender
nature
could
possibly
be
confide
to
old
Barley

by
reason
of
his
be
totally
unequal
to
the
consideration

more
psychological
than
Gout

Rum

converse

there
be
something
so
natural
and
win
in
Clara
's
resign
way
of
look
at
these
store
in
detail

Herbert
point
them
out

something
so
confide
,
loving
,
and
innocent
,
in
her
modest
manner
of
yield
herself
to
Herbert

embracing
arm

something
so
gentle
in
her
,
so
much
need
protection
on

by

Basin
,
and
the

book

I

<EOS>
I
be
look
at

with
pleasure

admiration
,
when
suddenly
the
growl
swell
into
a
roar
again

a

above

up

<EOS>
as
we
pass
Mr

's
door
,
he
be
hear
hoarsely
mutter
within
,
in
a
strain
that
rise
and
fall
like
wind
,
the
follow
Refrain
;
in

I
substitute
good
wish
for
something
quite
the

<EOS>
ahoy
!
<EOS>
bless
you

"
  
<EOS>
in
this
strain
of
consolation
,
Herbert
inform
me
the
invisible
Barley
would
commune
with
himself
by
the
day
and
night
together
;
often
while
it
be
light
,
have
,
at
the
same
time
,
one
eye
at
a
telescope
which
be
fit
on
his
bed
for
the
convenience
of
sweep
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
in
his
two
cabin
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
which
be
fresh
and
airy
,
and
in
which
Mr
Barley
be
less
audible
than
below
,
I
find
Provis
comfortably
settle
.
<EOS>
He
express
no
alarm
,
and
seem
to
feel
none
that
be
worth
mention
;
but
it
strike
me
that
he
be
soften
---
indefinably
,
for
I
could
not
have
say
how
,
and
could
never
afterwards
recall
how
when
I
try
;
but
certainly
.
  
<EOS>
the
opportunity
that
the
day
's
rest
have
give
me
for
reflection
,
have
result
in
my
fully
determine
to
say
nothing
to
him
respect
Compeyson
.
<EOS>
for
anything
I
know
,
his
animosity
towards
the
man
may
otherwise
lead
to
his
seek
him
out
and
rush
on
his
own
destruction
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
when
Herbert
and
I
sit
down
with
him
by
his
fire
,
I
ask
him
first
of
all
whether
he
rely
on
Wemmick
's
judgment
and
source
of
information
?
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
dear
boy
!
"
<EOS>
he
answer
,
with
a
grave
nod
,
"
jagger
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
I
have
talk
with
Wemmick
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
have
come
to
tell
you
what
caution
lie
give
me
and
what
advice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
I
do
accurately
,
with
the
reservation
just
mention
;
and
I
tell
him
how
Wemmick
have
hear
,
in
Newgate
prison
(
whether
from
officer
or
prisoner
I
could
not
say
)
,
that
he
be
under
some
suspicion
,
and
that
my
chamber
have
be
watch
;
how
Wemmick
have
recommend
his
keeping
close
for
a
time
,
and
my
keeping
away
from
him
;
and
what
Wemmick
have
say
about
get
him
abroad
.
<EOS>
I
add
,
that
of
course
,
when
the
time
come
,
I
should
go
with
him
,
or
should
follow
close
upon
him
,
as
may
be
safe
in
Wemmick
's
judgment
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
follow
that
,
I
do
not
touch
upon
;
neither
indeed
be
I
at
all
clear
or
comfortable
about
it
in
my
own
mind
,
<EOS>
now
that
I
see
him
in
that
soft
condition
,
and
in
declare
peril
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
as
to
alter
my
way
of
living
,
by
enlarge
my
expense
,
I
put
it
to
him
whether
in
our
present
unsettled
and
difficult
circumstance
,
it
would
not
be
simply
ridiculous
,
if
it
be
no
bad
?
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
deny
this
,
and
indeed
be
very
reasonable
throughout
.
<EOS>
His
come
back
be
a
venture
,
he
say
,
and
he
have
always
know
it
to
be
a
venture
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
nothing
to
make
it
a
desperate
venture
,
and
he
have
very
little
fear
of
his
safety
with
such
good
help
.
  
<EOS>
Herbert
,
who
have
be
look
at
the
fire
and
ponder
,
here
say
that
something
have
come
into
his
thought
arise
out
of
Wemmick
's
suggestion
,
which
it
may
be
worth
while
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
both
good
waterman
,
Handel
,
and
could
take
him
down
the
river
ourselves
when
the
right
time
come
.
<EOS>
no
boat
would
then
be
hire
for
the
purpose
,
and
no
boatman
;
that
would
save
at
least
a
chance
of
suspicion
,
and
any
chance
be
worth
save
.
<EOS>
never
mind
the
season
;
do
not
you
think
it
may
be
a
good
thing
if
you
begin
at
once
to
keep
a
boat
at
the
Temple
stair
,
and
be
in
the
habit
of
row
up
and
down
the
river
?
<EOS>
You
fall
into
that
habit
,
and
then
who
notice
or
mind
?
<EOS>
do
it
twenty
or
fifty
time
,
and
there
be
nothing
special
in
your
do
it
the
twenty
-
first
or
fifty
-
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
like
this
scheme
,
and
Provis
be
quite
elated
by
it
.
<EOS>
We
agree
that
it
should
be
carry
into
execution
,
and
that
Provis
should
never
recognize
us
if
we
come
below
Bridge
and
row
past
Mill
Pond
Bank
.
<EOS>
but
,
we
further
agree
that
he
should
pull
down
the
blind
in
that
part
of
his
window
which
give
upon
the
east
,
whenever
he
see
us
and
all
be
right
.
  
<EOS>
Our
conference
be
now
end
,
and
everything
arrange
,
I
rise
to
go
;
remark
to
Herbert
that
he
and
I
have
well
not
go
home
together
,
and
that
I
would
take
half
an
hour
's
start
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
to
leave
you
here
,
"
I
say
to
Provis
,
"
though
I
can
not
doubt
your
be
safe
here
than
near
me
.
<EOS>
good
-
bye
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
boy
,
"
he
answer
,
clasp
my
hand
,
"
I
do
not
know
when
we
may
meet
again
,
and
I
do
not
like
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
say
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
night
!
<EOS>
Herbert
will
go
regularly
between
us
,
and
when
the
time
come
you
may
be
certain
I
shall
be
ready
.
<EOS>
good
night
,
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
think
it
best
that
he
should
stay
in
his
own
room
,
and
we
leave
him
on
the
landing
outside
his
door
,
hold
a
light
over
the
stair
-
rail
to
light
us
down
stair
.
<EOS>
look
back
at
him
,
I
think
of
the
first
night
of
his
return
when
our
position
be
reverse
,
and
when
I
little
suppose
my
heart
could
ever
be
as
heavy
and
anxious
at
part
from
him
as
it
be
now
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Barley
be
growl
and
swear
when
we
repasse
his
door
,
with
no
appearance
of
have
cease
or
of
meaning
to
cease
.
<EOS>
when
we
get
to
the
foot
of
the
stair
,
I
ask
Herbert
whether
he
have
preserve
the
name
of
Provis
.
<EOS>
He
reply
,
certainly
not
,
and
that
the
lodger
be
Mr
Campbell
.
<EOS>
He
also
explain
that
the
utmost
know
of
Mr
Campbell
there
,
be
,
that
he
(
Herbert
)
have
Mr
Campbell
consign
to
him
,
and
feel
a
strong
personal
interest
in
his
be
well
care
for
,
and
live
a
secluded
life
.
<EOS>
so
,
when
we
go
into
the
parlour
where
Mrs
Whimple
and
Clara
be
seat
at
work
,
I
say
nothing
of
my
own
interest
in
Mr
Campbell
,
but
keep
it
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
take
leave
of
the
pretty
gentle
dark
-
eyed
girl
,
and
of
the
motherly
woman
who
have
not
outlive
her
honest
sympathy
with
a
little
affair
of
true
love
,
I
feel
as
if
the
Old
Green
Copper
Rope
-
Walk
have
grow
quite
a
different
place
.
<EOS>
Old
Barley
may
be
as
old
as
the
hill
,
and
may
swear
like
a
whole
field
of
trooper
,
but
there
be
redeem
youth
and
trust
and
hope
enough
in
Chinks
's
Basin
to
fill
it
to
overflow
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
think
of
Estella
,
and
of
our
parting
,
and
go
home
very
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
all
thing
be
as
quiet
in
the
Temple
as
ever
I
have
see
them
.
<EOS>
the
window
of
the
room
of
that
side
,
lately
occupy
by
Provis
,
be
dark
and
still
,
and
there
be
no
lounger
in
garden
-
court
.
<EOS>
I
walk
past
the
fountain
twice
or
thrice
before
I
descend
the
step
that
be
between
me
and
my
room
,
but
I
be
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
Herbert
come
to
my
bedside
when
he
come
in
---
for
I
go
straight
to
bed
,
dispirit
and
fatigue
---
make
the
same
report
.
<EOS>
open
one
of
the
window
after
that
,
he
look
out
into
the
moonlight
,
and
tell
me
that
the
pavement
be
as
solemnly
empty
as
the
pavement
of
any
Cathedral
at
that
same
hour
.
  
<EOS>
next
day
,
I
set
myself
to
get
the
boat
.
<EOS>
It
be
soon
do
,
and
the
boat
be
bring
round
to
the
Temple
stair
,
and
lie
where
I
could
reach
her
within
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
then
,
I
begin
to
go
out
as
for
training
and
practice
:
sometimes
alone
,
sometimes
with
Herbert
.
<EOS>
I
be
often
out
in
cold
,
rain
,
and
sleet
,
but
nobody
take
much
note
of
me
after
I
have
be
out
a
few
time
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
I
keep
above
Blackfriars
Bridge
;
but
as
the
hour
of
the
tide
change
,
I
take
towards
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
It
be
Old
London
Bridge
in
those
day
,
and
at
certain
state
of
the
tide
there
be
a
race
and
a
fall
of
water
there
which
give
it
a
bad
reputation
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
well
enough
how
to
"
shoot
"
the
bridge
after
see
it
do
,
and
so
begin
to
row
about
among
the
shipping
in
the
Pool
,
and
down
to
Erith
.
<EOS>
the
first
time
I
pass
Mill
Pond
Bank
,
Herbert
and
I
be
pull
a
pair
of
oar
;
and
,
both
in
go
and
return
,
we
see
the
blind
towards
the
east
come
down
.
<EOS>
Herbert
be
rarely
there
less
frequently
than
three
time
in
a
week
,
and
he
never
bring
me
a
single
word
of
intelligence
that
be
at
all
alarming
.
<EOS>
still
,
I
know
that
there
be
cause
for
alarm
,
and
<EOS>
I
could
not
get
rid
of
the
notion
of
be
watch
.
<EOS>
once
receive
,
it
be
a
haunting
idea
;
how
many
undesigne
person
I
suspect
of
watch
me
,
it
would
be
hard
to
calculate
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
be
always
full
of
fear
for
the
rash
man
who
be
in
hiding
.
<EOS>
Herbert
have
sometimes
say
to
me
that
he
find
it
pleasant
to
stand
at
one
of
our
window
after
dark
,
when
the
tide
be
run
down
,
and
to
think
that
it
be
flow
,
with
everything
it
bear
,
towards
Clara
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
with
dread
that
it
be
flow
towards
Magwitch
,
and
that
any
black
mark
on
its
surface
may
be
his
pursuer
,
go
swiftly
,
silently
,
and
surely
,
to
take
him
.

Chapter
47
 
<EOS>
some
week
pass
without
bring
any
change
.
<EOS>
We
wait
for
Wemmick
,
and
he
make
no
sign
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
never
know
him
out
of
Little
Britain
,
and
have
never
enjoy
the
privilege
of
be
on
a
familiar
footing
at
the
Castle
,
I
may
have
doubt
him
;
not
so
for
a
moment
,
know
him
as
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
My
worldly
affair
begin
to
wear
a
gloomy
appearance
,
and
I
be
press
for
money
by
more
than
one
creditor
.
<EOS>
even
I
myself
begin
to
know
the
want
of
money
(
I
mean
of
ready
money
in
my
own
pocket
)
,
and
to
relieve
it
by
convert
some
easily
spare
article
of
jewellery
into
cash
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
quite
determine
that
it
would
be
a
heartless
fraud
to
take
more
money
from
my
patron
in
the
exist
state
of
my
uncertain
thought
and
plan
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
I
have
send
him
the
unopened
pocket
-
book
by
Herbert
,
to
hold
in
his
own
keeping
<EOS>
and
I
feel
a
kind
of
satisfaction
---
whether
it
be
a
false
kind
or
a
true
,
I
hardly
know
---
in
not
have
profit
by
his
generosity
since
his
revelation
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
time
wear
on
,
an
impression
settle
heavily
upon
me
that
Estella
be
marry
.
<EOS>
fearful
of
have
it
confirm
,
though
it
be
all
but
a
conviction
,
I
avoid
the
newspaper
,
and
beg
Herbert
(
to
whom
I
have
confide
the
circumstance
of
our
last
interview
)
never
to
speak
of
her
to
me
.
<EOS>
why
I
hoard
up
this
last
wretched
little
rag
of
the
robe
of
hope
that
be
rend
and
give
to
the
wind
,
how
do
I
know
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
who
read
this
,
commit
that
not
dissimilar
inconsistency
of
your
own
,
last
year
,
last
month
,
last
week
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
unhappy
life
that
I
live
,
and
its
one
dominant
anxiety
,
tower
over
all
its
other
anxiety
like
a
high
mountain
above
a
range
of
mountain
,
never
disappear
from
my
view
.
<EOS>
still
,
no
new
cause
for
fear
arise
.
<EOS>
let
me
start
from
my
bed
as
I
would
,
with
the
terror
fresh
upon
me
that
he
be
discover
;
let
me
sit
listen
as
I
would
,
with
dread
,
for
Herbert
's
return
step
at
night
,
lest
it
should
be
fleet
than
ordinary
,
and
wing
with
evil
news
;
for
all
that
,
and
much
more
to
like
purpose
,
the
round
of
thing
go
on
.
<EOS>
condemn
to
inaction
and
a
state
of
constant
restlessness
and
suspense
,
I
row
about
in
my
boat
,
and
wait
,
wait
,
wait
,
as
I
best
could
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
state
of
the
tide
when
,
have
be
down
the
river
,
I
could
not
get
back
through
the
eddy
-
chafe
arch
and
starling
of
old
London
Bridge
;
then
,
I
leave
my
boat
at
a
wharf
near
the
Custom
House
,
to
be
bring
up
afterwards
to
the
Temple
stair
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
averse
to
do
this
,
as
it
serve
to
make
me
and
my
boat
a
commoner
incident
among
the
water
-
side
people
there
.
<EOS>
from
this
slight
occasion
,
spring
two
meeting
that
I
have
now
to
tell
of
.
  
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
late
in
the
month
of
February
,
I
come
ashore
at
the
wharf
at
dusk
.
<EOS>
I
have
pull
down
as
far
as
Greenwich
with
the
ebb
tide
,
and
have
turn
with
the
tide
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
fine
bright
day
,
but
have
become
foggy
as
the
sun
drop
,
and
I
have
have
to
feel
my
way
back
among
the
shipping
,
pretty
carefully
.
<EOS>
both
in
go
and
return
,
I
have
see
the
signal
in
his
window
,
all
well
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
be
a
raw
evening
<EOS>
and
I
be
cold
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
would
comfort
myself
with
dinner
at
once
;
and
as
I
have
hour
of
dejection
and
solitude
before
me
if
I
go
home
to
the
Temple
,
I
think
I
would
afterwards
go
to
the
play
.
<EOS>
the
theatre
where
Mr
Wopsle
have
achieve
his
questionable
triumph
,
be
in
that
waterside
neighbourhood
<EOS>
(
it
be
nowhere
now
)
,
and
to
that
theatre
I
resolve
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
be
aware
that
Mr
Wopsle
have
not
succeed
in
revive
the
Drama
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
rather
partake
of
its
decline
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
ominously
hear
of
,
through
the
playbill
,
as
a
faithful
black
,
in
connexion
with
a
little
girl
of
noble
birth
,
and
a
monkey
.
<EOS>
and
Herbert
have
see
him
as
a
predatory
Tartar
of
comic
propensity
,
with
a
face
like
a
red
brick
,
and
an
outrageous
hat
all
over
bell
.
  
<EOS>
I
dine
at
what
Herbert
<EOS>
and
I
use
to
call
a
geographical
chop
-
house
---
where
there
be
map
of
the
world
in
porter
-
pot
rim
on
every
half
-
yard
of
the
table
-
cloth
,
and
<EOS>
chart
of
gravy
on
every
one
of
the
knife
---
to
this
day
there
be
scarcely
a
single
chop
-
house
within
the
Lord
Mayor
's
dominion
which
be
not
geographical
---
and
wear
out
the
time
in
doze
over
crumb
,
stare
at
gas
,
and
bake
in
a
hot
blast
of
dinner
.
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
,
I
rouse
myself
and
go
to
the
play
.
  
<EOS>
there
,
I
find
a
virtuous
boatswain
in
his
Majesty
's
service
---
a
most
excellent
man
,
though
I
could
have
wish
his
trouser
not
quite
so
tight
in
some
place
and
not
quite
so
loose
in
other
---
who
knock
all
the
little
man
's
hat
over
their
eye
,
though
he
be
very
generous
and
brave
,
and
who
would
not
hear
of
anybody
's
pay
taxis
,
though
he
be
very
patriotic
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
bag
of
money
in
his
pocket
,
like
a
pudding
in
the
cloth
,
and
on
that
property
marry
a
young
person
in
bed
-
furniture
,
with
great
rejoicing
;
the
whole
population
of
Portsmouth
(
nine
in
number
at
the
last
Census
)
turn
out
on
the
beach
,
to
rub
their
own
hand
and
shake
everybody
else
's
,
and
sing
"
fill
,
fill
!
"
<EOS>
a
certain
dark
-
complexioned
Swab
,
however
,
who
would
not
fill
,
or
do
anything
else
that
be
propose
to
him
,
and
whose
heart
be
openly
state
(
by
the
boatswain
)
to
be
as
black
as
his
figure
-
head
,
<EOS>
propose
to
two
other
swab
to
get
all
mankind
into
difficulty
;
which
be
so
effectually
do
(
the
Swab
family
have
considerable
political
influence
)
that
it
take
half
the
evening
to
set
thing
right
,
and
then
it
be
only
bring
about
through
an
honest
little
grocer
with
a
white
hat
,
black
gaiter
,
and
red
nose
,
get
into
a
clock
,
with
a
gridiron
,
and
listening
,
and
come
out
,
and
knock
everybody
down
from
behind
with
the
gridiron
whom
he
could
not
confute
with
what
he
have
overhear
.
<EOS>
this
lead
to
Mr
Wopsle
's
(
who
have
never
be
hear
of
before
)
come
in
with
a
star
and
garter
on
,
as
a
plenipotentiary
of
great
power
direct
from
the
Admiralty
,
to
say
that
the
Swabs
be
all
to
go
to
prison
on
the
spot
,
and
that
he
have
bring
the
boatswain
down
the
Union
Jack
,
as
a
slight
acknowledgment
of
his
public
service
.
<EOS>
the
boatswain
,
unmanned
for
the
first
time
,
respectfully
dry
his
eye
on
the
Jack
,
and
then
cheer
up
and
address
Mr
Wopsle
as
Your
honour
,
solicit
permission
to
take
him
by
the
fin
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wopsle
concede
his
fin
with
a
gracious
dignity
,
be
immediately
shove
into
a
dusty
corner
while
everybody
dance
a
hornpipe
;
and
from
that
corner
,
survey
the
public
with
a
discontent
eye
,
become
aware
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
piece
be
the
last
new
grand
comic
Christmas
pantomime
,
in
the
first
scene
of
which
,
it
pain
me
to
suspect
that
I
detect
Mr
Wopsle
with
red
worst
leg
under
a
highly
magnify
phosphoric
countenance
and
a
shock
of
red
curtain
-
fringe
for
his
hair
,
engage
in
the
manufacture
of
thunderbolt
in
a
mine
,
and
display
great
cowardice
when
his
gigantic
master
come
home
(
very
hoarse
)
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
but
he
presently
present
himself
under
worthy
circumstance
;
for
,
the
Genius
of
Youthful
Love
be
in
want
of
assistance
---
on
account
of
the
parental
brutality
of
an
ignorant
farmer
who
oppose
the
choice
of
his
daughter
's
heart
,
by
purposely
fall
upon
the
object
,
in
a
flour
sack
,
out
of
the
first
-
floor
window
---
summon
a
sententious
Enchanter
;
and
he
,
come
up
from
the
antipode
rather
unsteadily
,
after
an
apparently
violent
journey
,
prove
to
be
Mr
Wopsle
in
a
high
-
crown
hat
,
with
a
necromantic
work
in
one
volume
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
the
business
of
this
enchanter
on
earth
,
be
principally
to
be
talk
at
,
sing
at
,
butt
at
<EOS>
,
dance
at
,
and
flash
at
with
fire
of
various
colour
,
he
have
a
good
deal
of
time
on
his
hand
.
<EOS>
and
I
observe
with
great
surprise
,
that
he
devote
it
to
stare
in
my
direction
as
if
he
be
lose
in
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
remarkable
in
the
increase
glare
of
Mr
Wopsle
's
eye
,
and
he
seem
to
be
turn
so
many
thing
over
in
his
mind
and
to
grow
so
confused
,
that
I
could
not
make
it
out
.
<EOS>
I
sit
think
of
it
,
long
after
he
have
ascend
to
the
cloud
in
a
large
watch
-
case
,
and
still
I
could
not
make
it
out
.
<EOS>
I
be
still
think
of
it
when
I
come
out
of
the
theatre
an
hour
afterwards
,
and
find
him
wait
for
me
near
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
?
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
shake
hand
with
him
as
we
turn
down
the
street
together
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
that
you
see
me
.
"
  
"
see
you
,
Mr
Pip
!
"
he
return
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
of
course
I
see
you
.
<EOS>
but
who
else
be
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
else
?
"
  
"
It
be
the
strange
thing
,
"
say
Mr
Wopsle
,
drift
into
his
lost
look
again
;
"
and
yet
I
could
swear
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
become
alarm
,
I
entreat
Mr
Wopsle
to
explain
his
meaning
.
  
<EOS>
"
whether
I
should
have
notice
him
at
first
but
for
your
be
there
,
"
say
Mr
Wopsle
,
go
on
in
the
same
lose
way
,
"
I
can
not
be
positive
;
yet
I
think
I
should
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Involuntarily
I
look
round
me
,
as
I
be
accustomed
to
look
round
me
when
I
go
home
;
for
,
these
mysterious
word
give
me
a
chill
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
He
can
not
be
in
sight
,
"
say
Mr
Wopsle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
go
out
,
before
I
go
off
,
I
see
him
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
the
reason
that
I
have
,
for
be
suspicious
,
I
even
suspect
this
poor
actor
.
<EOS>
I
mistrust
a
design
to
entrap
me
into
some
admission
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
I
glance
at
him
as
we
walk
on
together
,
but
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
ridiculous
fancy
that
he
must
be
with
you
,
Mr
Pip
,
till
I
see
that
you
be
quite
unconscious
of
him
,
sit
behind
you
there
,
like
a
ghost
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
former
chill
creep
over
me
again
,
but
I
be
resolve
not
to
speak
yet
,
for
it
be
quite
consistent
with
his
word
that
he
may
be
set
on
to
induce
me
to
connect
these
reference
with
Provis
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
be
perfectly
sure
and
safe
that
Provis
have
not
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
wonder
at
me
,
Mr
Pip
;
indeed
I
see
you
do
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
so
very
strange
!
<EOS>
You
will
hardly
believe
what
I
be
go
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
believe
it
myself
,
if
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
?
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pip
,
you
remember
in
old
time
a
certain
Christmas
Day
,
when
you
be
quite
a
child
,
and
I
dine
at
Gargery
's
,
and
some
soldier
come
to
the
door
to
get
a
pair
of
handcuff
mend
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
remember
that
there
be
a
chase
after
two
convict
,
and
that
we
join
in
it
,
and
that
Gargery
take
you
on
his
back
,
and
that
I
take
the
lead
and
you
keep
up
with
me
as
well
as
you
could
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
than
he
think
---
except
the
last
clause
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
remember
that
we
come
up
with
the
two
in
a
ditch
,
and
that
there
be
a
scuffle
between
them
,
and
that
one
of
them
have
be
severely
handle
and
much
maul
about
the
face
,
by
the
other
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
all
before
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
that
the
soldier
light
torch
,
and
put
the
two
in
the
centre
,
and
that
we
go
on
to
see
the
last
of
them
,
over
the
black
marsh
,
with
the
torchlight
shine
on
their
face
---
I
be
particular
about
that
;
with
the
torchlight
shine
on
their
face
,
when
there
be
an
outer
ring
of
dark
night
all
about
us
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
then
Mr
Pip
,
one
of
those
two
prisoner
sit
behind
you
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
see
him
over
your
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
steady
!
"
I
think
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
then
,
"
which
of
the
two
do
you
suppose
you
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
one
who
have
be
maul
,
"
he
answer
readily
,
"
and
I
will
swear
I
see
him
!
<EOS>
the
more
I
think
of
him
,
the
more
certain
I
be
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
curious
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
with
the
good
assumption
I
could
put
on
,
of
its
be
nothing
more
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
very
curious
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
exaggerate
the
enhanced
disquiet
into
which
this
conversation
throw
me
,
or
the
special
and
peculiar
terror
I
feel
at
<EOS>
Compeyson
's
have
be
behind
me
"
like
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
,
if
he
have
ever
be
out
of
my
thought
for
a
few
moment
together
since
the
hiding
have
begin
,
it
be
in
those
very
moment
when
he
be
close
to
me
;
and
to
think
that
I
should
be
so
unconscious
and
off
my
guard
after
all
my
care
,
be
as
if
I
have
shut
an
avenue
of
a
hundred
door
to
keep
him
out
,
and
then
have
find
him
at
my
elbow
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
doubt
either
that
he
be
there
,
because
I
be
there
,
and
that
however
alight
an
appearance
of
danger
there
may
be
about
us
,
danger
be
always
near
and
active
.
  
<EOS>
I
put
such
question
to
Mr
Wopsle
as
<EOS>
,
when
do
the
man
come
in
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
tell
me
that
;
he
see
me
,
and
over
my
shoulder
he
see
the
man
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
he
have
see
him
for
some
time
that
he
begin
to
identify
him
;
but
he
have
from
the
first
vaguely
associate
him
with
me
,
and
know
him
as
somehow
belong
to
me
in
the
old
village
time
.
<EOS>
how
be
he
dress
?
<EOS>
prosperously
,
but
not
noticeably
otherwise
;
he
think
,
in
black
.
<EOS>
be
his
face
at
all
disfigure
?
<EOS>
no
,
he
believe
not
.
<EOS>
I
believe
not
,
too
,
for
,
although
in
my
brooding
state
I
have
take
no
especial
notice
of
the
people
behind
me
,
I
think
it
likely
that
a
face
at
all
disfigured
would
have
attract
my
attention
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr
Wopsle
have
impart
to
me
all
that
he
could
recall
or
I
extract
,
and
when
I
have
treat
him
to
a
little
appropriate
refreshment
after
the
fatigue
of
the
evening
,
we
part
.
<EOS>
It
be
between
twelve
and
one
o'clock
when
I
reach
the
Temple
,
and
the
gate
be
shut
.
<EOS>
no
one
be
near
me
when
I
go
in
and
go
home
.
  
<EOS>
Herbert
have
come
in
,
and
we
hold
a
very
serious
council
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
,
save
to
communicate
to
Wemmick
what
I
have
that
night
<EOS>
find
out
,
and
to
remind
him
that
we
wait
for
his
hint
.
<EOS>
as
I
think
chat
I
may
compromise
him
if
I
go
too
often
to
the
Castle
,
I
make
this
communication
by
letter
.
<EOS>
I
write
it
before
I
go
to
bed
,
and
go
out
and
post
it
;
and
again
no
one
be
near
me
.
<EOS>
Herbert
<EOS>
and
I
agree
that
we
could
do
nothing
else
but
be
very
cautious
.
<EOS>
and
we
be
very
cautious
indeed
---
more
cautious
than
before
,
if
that
be
possible
---
and
I
for
my
part
never
go
near
Chinks
's
Basin
,
except
when
I
row
by
,
and
then
I
only
look
at
Mill
Pond
Bank
as
I
look
at
anything
else
.

Chapter

<EOS>
the
second
of
the
two
meeting
refer
to
in
the
last
chapter
,
occur
about
a
week
after
the
first
.
<EOS>
I
have
again
leave
my
boat
at
the
wharf
below
Bridge
;
the
time
be
an
hour
earlier
in
the
afternoon
;
and
,
undecided
where
to
dine
,
I
have
stroll
up
into
Cheapside
,
and
be
stroll
along
it
,
<EOS>
surely
the
most
unsettled
person
in
all
the
busy
concourse
,
when
a
large
hand
be
lay
upon
my
shoulder
,
by
some
one
overtake
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mr
Jaggers
's
hand
,
and
he
pass
it
through
my
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
we
be

Pip

<EOS>
where

for

"
<EOS>
for
the

I

,
"
say
I.
  
"
<EOS>
do
not
you
know
?
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
return
,
glad
for
once
to
get
the
well
of
him
in
cross
-
examination
,
"
I
do
 
\
not

<EOS>
know

for
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
to

?
"
say
Mr

.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not

<EOS>
"
  
"
no

I

I

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

admit
also
,
that
I

<EOS>
"

"
then
,
"

Mr

"
come

<EOS>
I
be
go
to

myself
,
when

,
"
Wemmick

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
I
change
my
excuse
into
an
acceptance
---
<EOS>
the
few
word
I
have
utter
,
serve
for
the
beginning
of
either
---
<EOS>
and
we
go
along
Cheapside
and
slant
off
to
Little
Britain
,
while
the
light
be
spring
up
brilliantly
in
the
shop
window
,
and
the
street
lamp
-
lighter
,
scarcely
find
ground
enough
to
plant
their
ladder
on
in
the
midst
of
the
afternoon
's
bustle
,
be
skip
up

down
and
run
in

out
,
open
more
red
eye
in
the
gathering
fog
than
my
rushlight
tower
at
the
Hummums
have
open
white
eye
in
the
ghostly

<EOS>
at
the
office
in
Little

there
be
the
usual
letter

writing

hand

washing
,
candle

snuff
,
and
safe

the
business

<EOS>
as
I
stand
idle
by
Mr
Jagger
's
fire
,
its
rise
and
fall
flame
make
the
two
cast
on
the
shelf
look
as
if
they
be
play
a
diabolical

at
bo

with
me

the

coarse
fat

candle
that
dimly

Mr
Jaggers
as
he
write
in
a
corner

be
decorate
with
dirty
winding

<EOS>
We
go
to
Gerrard

street
,
all
three
together
,
in
a
hackney

coach
:
and
as
soon
as
we
get
there
,
dinner
be
serve
.
<EOS>
although
I
should
not
have
think
of
make
,
in
that
place
,
the
most
distant
reference
by
so
much
as
a
look
to
Wemmick
's
Walworth
sentiment
,
yet
I
should
have
have
no
objection
to
catch
his
eye
now
and
then
in
a
friendly
way
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
He
turn
his
eye
on
Mr
Jaggers
whenever
he
raise
them
from
the
table
,
and
be
as
dry
and
distant
to
me
as
if
there
be
twin
wemmick

this
be
the
wrong
one

<EOS>
"
do

Mr

that
render
me
rather
uncertain

"
if
Mr

Wemmick
to
Mr

,
"
he

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
receive
this
as
an
intimation
that
it
be
good
not
to
delay
I
settle
that
I
would
go
to

morrow
,
and
say
so
.
<EOS>
Wemmick
drink
a
glass
of
wine
and
look
with
a
grimly
satisfied
air
at
Mr
Jaggers
,
but
not
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so

Pip

<EOS>
Our
friend
the
Spider

"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
"
have
play
his
card
.
<EOS>
He
have
win
the
pool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
as
much
as
I
could
do
to
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
hah
!
<EOS>
He
be
a
promising
fellow
---
in
his
way

but
he
may
not
have
it
all
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
the
strong
will
win
in
the
end
,
but
the
strong
have
to
be
find
out
first
.
<EOS>
if
he
should
turn
to
,
and
beat
her
---
"
  
"
surely
,
"
I
interrupt
,
with
a
burn
face
and
heart
,
"
you
do
not
seriously
think
that
he
be
scoundrel
enough
for
that
,
Mr
Jaggers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
so
,
Pip
.
<EOS>
I
be
put
a
case
.
<EOS>
if
he
should
turn
to
and
beat
her
,
he
may
possibly
get
the
strength
on
his
side
;
if
it
should
be
a
question
of
intellect
,
he
certainly
will
not
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
chance
work
to
give
an
opinion
how
a
fellow
of
that
sort
will
turn
out
in
such
circumstance
,
because
it
be
a
toss

up
between
two
result
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
what
they
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
fellow
like
our
friend
the
Spider
,
"
answer
Mr
Jaggers
,
"
either
beat
,
or
cringe
.
<EOS>
He
may
cringe
and
growl
,
or
cringe
and
not
growl
;
but
he
either
beat
or
cringe
.
<EOS>
ask
Wemmick
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
his
\
 
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
"
either
beat
or
cringe

"
say
Wemmick
,
not
at
all
address
himself
to
me

<EOS>
"
so
,
here
be
to
Mrs
Bentley
Drummle
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
take
a
decanter
of
choicer
wine
from
his
dumb

waiter
,
and
fill
for
each
of
us

for
himself

"
and
may
the
question
of
supremacy
be

satisfaction

<EOS>
to
the
satisfaction

lady
                     
GREAT

Molly

Molly

Molly

how
slow
you
be
to

day

"
  
<EOS>
She
be
at
his
elbow
when
he
address
her
,
put
a
dish
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
as
she
withdraw
her
hand
from
it
,
she
fall
back
a
step
or
two
,
nervously
mutter
some
excuse
.
<EOS>
and
a
certain
action
of
her
finger
as
she
speak
arrest
my
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
.
<EOS>
only
the
subject
we
be
speak
of
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
rather
painful
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
action
of
her
finger
be
like
the
action
of
knitting
.
<EOS>
She
stand
look
at
her
master
,
not
understand
whether
she
be
free
to
go
,
or
whether
he
have
more
to
say
to
her
and
would
call
her
back
if
she
do
go
.
<EOS>
Her
look
be
very
intent
.
<EOS>
surely
,
I
have
see
exactly
such
eye
and
such
hand
,
on
a
memorable
occasion
very
lately
!
  
<EOS>
He
dismiss
her
,
and
she
glide
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
but
she
remain
before
me
,
as
plainly
as
if
she
be
still
there
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
those
hand
,
I
look
at
those
eye
,
I
look
at
that
flow
hair
;
and
I
compare
them
with
other
hand
,
other
eye
,
other
hair
,
that
I
know
of
,
and
with
what
those
may
be
after
twenty
year
of
a
brutal
husband
and
a
stormy
life
.
<EOS>
I
look
again
at
those
hand
and
eye
of
the
housekeeper
,
and
think
of
the
inexplicable
feeling
that
have
come
over
me
when
I
last
walk
---
not
alone
---
in
the
ruin
garden
,
and
through
the
desert
brewery
.
<EOS>
I
think
how
the
same
feeling
have
come
back
when
I
see
a
face
look
at
me
,
and
a
hand
wave
to
me
,
from
a
stage
-
coach
window
;
and
how
it
have
come
back
again
and
have
flash
about
me
like
lightning
,
when
I
have
pass
in
a
carriage
---
not
alone
---
through
a
sudden
glare
of
light
in
a
dark
street
.
<EOS>
I
think
how
one
link
of
association
have
help
that
identification
in
the
theatre
,
and
how
such
a
link
,
want
before
,
have
be
rivet
for
me
now
,
when
I
have
pass
by
a
chance
swift
from
Estella
's
name
to
the
finger
with
their
knitting
action
,
and
the
attentive
eye
.
<EOS>
and
I
feel
absolutely
certain
that
this
woman
be
Estella
's
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
have
see
me
with
Estella
,
and
be
not
likely
to
have
miss
the
sentiment
I
have
be
at
no
pain
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
He
nod
when
I
say
the
subject
be
painful
to
me
,
clap
me
on
the
back
,
put
round
the
wine
again
,
and
go
on
with
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
only
twice
more
,
do
the
housekeeper
reappear
,
and
then
her
stay
in
the
room
be
very
short
,
and
Mr
Jaggers
be
sharp
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
her
hand
be
Estella
's
hand
,
and
her
eye
be
Estella
's
eye
,
and
if
she
have
reappear
a
hundred
time
I
could
have
be
neither
more
sure
nor
less
sure
that
my
conviction
be
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
dull
evening
,
for
Wemmick
draw
his
wine
when
it
come
round
,
quite
as
a
matter
of
business
---
just
as
he
may
have
draw
his
salary
when
that
come
round
---
and
with
his
eye
on
his
chief
,
sit
in
a
state
of
perpetual
readiness
for
cross
-
examination
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
quantity
of
wine
,
his
post
-
office
be
as
indifferent
and
ready
as
any
other
post
-
office
for
its
quantity
of
letter
.
<EOS>
from
my
point
of
view
,
he
be
the
wrong
twin
all
the
time
,
and
only
externally
like
the
Wemmick
of
Walworth
.
  
<EOS>
We
take
our
leave
early
,
and
leave
together
.
<EOS>
even
when
we
be
grope
among
Mr

I
feel
that

not

half
a

Wemmick

quite
astonishing

comparatively
early
day
with

then
,

he
work

admiration

himself

sit

Counsel

know

the
murdered

be
a
woman
;
a
woman
,
a

ten

old

very

large

very

<EOS>
It
be

They
both
lead
tramping
life

this
woman
in
Gerrard

here
have
be
marry
very
young
,
over
the
broomstick
(
as
we
say
)
,
to

certainly
,
in

be
find
dead

there

there

"
well

Wemmick
go
on

"
it
happen

happen

do
not
you
see

that
this

be
so
very
artfully
dressed

the
time

her
apprehension

that
she
look
much
slighter
than
she
really
be
;
in

,
her
sleeve
be
always
remember
to
have
be
so
skilfully
contrive
that
her
arm
have
quite
a
delicate
look
.
<EOS>
She
have
only
a
bruise
or
two
about
her
---
nothing
for
a
tramp
---
but
the
back
of
her
hand
be
lacerate
,
and
the
question
be
,
be
it
with
finger
-
nail
?
<EOS>
now
,
Mr
Jaggers
show
that
she
have
struggle
through
a
great
lot
of
bramble
which
be
not
as
high
as
her
face
;
but
which
she
could
not
have
get
through
and
keep
her
hand
out
of
;
and
bit
of
those
bramble
be
actually
find
in
her
skin

put
in
evidence
,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
the
bramble
in
question
be
find
on
examination
to
have
be
break
through
,
and
to
have
little
shred
of
her
dress
and
little
spot
of
blood
upon
them
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
but
the
bold
point
he
make
,
be
this
.
<EOS>
It
be
attempt
to
be
set
up
in
proof
of
her
jealousy
,
that
she
be
under
strong
suspicion
of
have
,
at
about
the
time
of
the
murder
,
frantically
destroy
her
child
by
this
man
---
some
three
year
old
---
to
revenge
herself
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
work
that
,
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
We
say
these
be
not
mark
of
finger

nail

mark

bramble

we
show
you
the
bramble
.
<EOS>
You
say
they
be
mark
of
finger

and
you
set
up
the
hypothesis
that
she
destroy
her
child

<EOS>
You
must
accept
all
consequence
of
that
hypothesis

<EOS>
for
anything
we

she
may
have
destroy

the

scratch
her
hand

what
then

You
be
not

up

Mr

I
seek
to
get

quietly
by

the

bear
to

they
hover
about
the
grey
tower

swing
in
the

I

sit
on

close

lose
in
the
contemplation
of
,
the
ashy

do
as
I
have
often
do

I
go

stand

touch
the
old
chimney

piece
,
where
she
could
see
me
when
she
raise
her

.
<EOS>
there
be
an
air
of
utter
loneliness
upon

,
that
would
have
move
me
to
pity
though
she
have
wilfully
do
me
a
deep
injury
than
I
could
charge
her
with

compassionate

as
I
bring
another
of
the
ragged
chair
to
the
hearth
and
sit
down
,
I
remark
a
new
expression
on
her
face
,
as
if
she
be
afraid
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
,
"
she
say
,
"
to
pursue
that
subject
you
mention
to
me
when
you
be
last
here
,
and
to
show
you
that
I
be
not
all
stone
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
can
never
believe
,
now
,
that
there
be
anything
human
in

"
  
<EOS>
when
I
say
some
reassuring
word
,
she
stretch
out
her
tremulous
right
hand
,
as
though
she
be
go
to
touch
me
;
but
she
recall
it
again
before
I
understand
the
action
,
or
know
how
to
receive
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
,
speak
for
your
friend
,
that
you
could
tell
me
how
to
do
something
useful
and
good

<EOS>

what
be
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
begin
explain
to
her
that
secret
history
of
the
partnership
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
get
far
into
it
,
when
I
judge
from
her
look
that
she
be
think
in
a
discursive
way
of
me
,
rather
than
of
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
so
,
for
,
when
I
stop
speak
,
many
moment
pass
before
she
show
that
she
be
conscious
of
the
fact
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
break
off
,
"
she
ask
then
,
with
her
former
air
of
be
afraid
of
me
,
"
because
you
hate
me
too
much
to
bear
to
speak
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no

I
answer
,
"
how
can
you
think
so

Miss

stop

be
not

what

perhaps
I
be
not

she
answer
,
put
a
hand
to
her

"
<EOS>
begin
again
,
and
let
me
look
at
something
else
.
<EOS>
stay
!
<EOS>
now
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
set
her
hand
upon
her
stick
,
in
the
resolute
way
that
sometimes
be
habitual
to
her
,
and
look
at
the
fire
with
a
strong
expression
of
force
herself
to
attend
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
with
my
explanation
,
and
tell
her
how
I
have
hope
to
complete
the
transaction
out
of
my
mean
,
but
how
in
this
I
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
that
part
of
the
subject
(
I
remind
her
)
involve
matter
which
could
form
no
part
of
my
explanation
,
for
they
be
the
weighty
secret
of
another

<EOS>
"
so
!
"
say
she
,
assent
with
her
head
,
but
not
look
at
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
how
much
money
be
want

complete
the
purchase

"
  
<EOS>
I
be
rather
afraid
of
state
it
,
for
it
sound
a
large
sum

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nine
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
give
you
the
money
for
this
purpose

will
you
keep
my
secret
as
you

keep
your

<EOS>

quite
as

much
more
at

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
very
unhappy
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
ask
this
question
,
still
without
look
at
me
,
but
in
an
unwonted
tone
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
reply
at
the
moment
,
for
my
voice
fail
me
.
<EOS>
She
put
her
left
arm
across
the
head
of
her
stick
,
and
softly
lay
her
forehead
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
far
from
happy
,
Miss
Havisham
;

I
have
other
cause
of
disquiet
than
any
you
know
of
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
secret
I
have
mention
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
little
while
,
she
raise
her
head
and
look
at
the
fire
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
noble
in
you
to
tell
me
that
you
have
other
cause
of
unhappiness

it
true

<EOS>

true

even
more

<EOS>
She
presently
rise
from
her
seat
,
and
look
about
the
blight
room
for
the
mean
of
writing
.
<EOS>
there
be
none
there
,
and
she
take
from
her
pocket
a
yellow
set
of
ivory
tablet
,
mount
in
tarnished
gold
,
and
write
upon
them
with
a
pencil
in
a
case
of
tarnished
gold

hang
from

neck

<EOS>

You

Quite

I

<EOS>

<EOS>
She
read
me
what
she
have

it
be
direct
and
clear
,
and
evidently
intend
to
absolve
me
from
any
suspicion
of
profit
by
the
receipt
of
the
money
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
tablet
from
her
hand
,
and
it
tremble
again
,
and
it
tremble
more
as
she
take
off
the
chain
to
which
the
pencil
be
attach
,
and
put
it
in
mine
.
<EOS>
all
this
she
do
,
without

at

<EOS>
"
My

I
can
do
it
now

there
have
be
sore

my

be

thankless
one

I
want
forgiveness

too
much

<EOS>
She
turn
her
face
to
me
for
the
first
time
since
she
have
avert
it
,
and
,
to
my
amazement
,
I
may
even
add
to
my
terror
,
drop
on
her
knee
at
my
foot
;
with
her
folded
hand
raise
to
me
in
the
manner
in
which
,
when
her
poor
heart
be
young

fresh

whole

they
must
often
have
be
raise
to
heaven
from

side

<EOS>
to
see
her
with
her
white
hair

her
worn
face
kneel
at
my
foot

give
me
a
shock
through
all
my
frame

<EOS>
I
entreat
her
to
rise
,
and
get
my
arm
about
her
to
help
her
up
;
but
she
only
press
that
hand
of
mine
which
be
near
to
her
grasp
,
and
hang
her
head
over
it
and
weep
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
her
shed
a
tear
before
,
and
,
in
the
hope
that
the
relief
may
do
her
good

I
bend
over
her
without

She
be
not

be
down
upon

<EOS>
"

she

despairingly

very

I

yes

so

"

She
wring
her

to
this
cry
over
and
over
again

<EOS>
I
know
not

comfort
her

<EOS>
that
she
have
do
a
grievous

an

mould
into
the
form
that
her

find
vengeance

that

in
shut
out
the
light
of

she
have
shut
out
infinitely
more

that

in

seclude
herself
from

could
I
look

her
punishment
in
the
ruin
she
be

in
her
profound
unfitness

in

away

you

dismiss

Estella

ever
undo

amiss

believe
this

when

I

well

well

I
hope
so

as
she
grow
,
and
promise
to
be
very
beautiful

I
gradually
do
worse

with
my
praise
,

with
my
jewel

with
my
teaching

with
this
figure

myself
always
before
her
a
warning

back

point
my
lesson

I
steal
her
heart
away

put
ice
in

<EOS>

well

I
could
not

say
,
"
to
have
leave
her
a
natural
heart

even
to
be
bruise
or
break
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
,
Miss
Havisham
look
distractedly
at
me
for
a
while
,
and
then
burst
out
again
,
what
have
she
do
!
  
<EOS>
"
if
you

all

she
plead

you
would

compassion

well
understanding

"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Havisham
,
"
I
answer
,
as
delicately
as
I
could

I
believe
I
may
say
that
I
do
know
your
story

have
know
it
ever

I

leave
this

inspire

great
commiseration

I
understand
it

its

<EOS>
do
what
have
pass
between
us
give
me
any
excuse
for
ask
you
a
question
relative
to
Estella
?
<EOS>
not
as
she
be
,

as
she
be
when
she
first
come
here
?

"
  
<EOS>
She
be
seat
on
the
ground
,
with
her
arm
on
the
ragged
chair
,

her
head
lean
on
them

<EOS>
She
look
full
at
me

I
say
this

,
"
go
on

whose

Mr

bring

here

send
her
here

<EOS>
"
bring
her
here

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
me
how
that
come
about
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
answer
in
a
low
whisper
and
with
caution
:
"
I
have
be
shut
up
in
these
room
a
long
time
(
I
do
not
know
how
long
;
you
know
what
time
the
clock
keep
here
)
,
when
I
tell
him
that
I
want
a
little
girl
to
rear
and
love
,
and
save
from
my
fate

<EOS>
I
have
first
see
him
when
I
send
for
him
to
lay
this
place
waste
for
me
;
have
read
of
him
in
the
newspaper
,
before
I
and
the
world
part
.

He
tell
me
that
he
would
look
about
him
for
such
an
orphan
child
.
<EOS>
one
night
he
bring
her
here
asleep
,
and
I
call
her
Estella

"
  
<EOS>
"
may
I
ask
her
age
then
?
"
  
"
two
or
three
.
<EOS>
She
herself
know
nothing
,
but
that
she
be
leave
an
orphan
and
I
adopt
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
convinced
I
be
of
that
woman
's
be
her
mother
,
that
I
want
no
evidence
to
establish
the
fact
in
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
but
,
to
any
mind
,
I
think
,
the
connection
here
be
clear
and
straight
.
  
<EOS>
what
more
could
I
hope
to
do
by
prolong
the
interview
?
<EOS>
I
have
succeed
on
behalf
of
Herbert
,
Miss
Havisham
have
tell
me
all
she
know
of
Estella
,
I
have
say
and
do
what
I
could
to
ease
her
mind
.
<EOS>
no
matter
with
what
other
word
we
part
;
we
part
.
  
<EOS>
twilight
be
close
in
when
I
go
down
stair
into
the
natural
air
.
<EOS>
I
call
to
the
woman
who
have
open
the
gate
when
I
enter
,
that
I
would
not
trouble
her
just
yet
,
but
would
walk
round
the
place
before
leave
.
<EOS>
for
,
I
have
a
presentiment
that
I
should
never
be
there
again
,
and
I
feel
that
the
die
light
be
suit
to
my
last
view
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
wilderness
of
cask
that
I
have
walk
on
long
ago
,
and
on
which
the
rain
of
year
have
fall
since
,
rot
them
in
many
place
,
and
leave
miniature
swamp
and
pool
of
water
upon
those
that
stand
on
end
,
I
make
my
way
to
the
ruin
garden
.
<EOS>
I
go
all
round
it
;
round
by
the
corner
where
Herbert
and
I
have
fight
our
battle
;
round
by
the
path
where
Estella
and
I
have
walk
.
<EOS>
so
cold
,
so
lonely
,
so
dreary
all
!
  
<EOS>
take
the
brewery
on
my
way
back
,
I
raise
the
rusty
latch
of
a
little
door
at
the
garden
end
of
it
,
and
walk
through
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
out
at
the
opposite
door
---
not
easy
to
open
now
,
for
the
damp
wood
have
start
and
swell
,
and
the
hinge
be
yield
,
and
the
threshold
be
encumber
with
a
growth
of
fungus
---
when
I
turn
my
head
to
look
back
.
<EOS>
a
childish
association
revive
with
wonderful
force
in
the
moment
of
the
slight
action
,
and
I
fancy
that
I
see
Miss
Havisham
hang
to
the
beam
.
<EOS>
so
strong
be
the
impression
,
that
I
stand
under
the
beam
shudder
from
head
to
foot
before
I
know
it
be
a
fancy
---
though
to
be
sure
I
be
there
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
the
mournfulness
of
the
place
and
time
,
and
the
great
terror
of
this
illusion
,
though
it
be
but
momentary
,
cause
me
to
feel
an
indescribable
awe
as
I
come
out
between
the
open
wooden
gate
where
I
have
once
wrung
my
hair
after
Estella
have
wrung
my
heart
.
<EOS>
pass
on
into
the
front
court
-
yard
,
I
hesitate
whether
to
call
the
woman
to
let
me
out
at
the
lock
gate
of
which
she
have
the
key
,
or
first
to
go
up
-
stair
and
assure
myself
that
Miss
Havisham
be
as
safe
and
well
as
I
have
leave
her
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
latter
course
and
go
up
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
into
the
room
where
I
have
leave
her
,
and
I
see
her
seat
in
the
ragged
chair
upon
the
hearth
close
to
the
fire
,
with
her
back
towards
me
.
<EOS>
in
the
moment
when
I
be
withdraw
my
head
to
go
quietly
away
,
I
see
a
great
flaming
light
spring
up
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
moment
,
I
see
her
running
at
me
,
shriek
,
with
a
whirl
of
fire
blaze
all
about
her
,
and
soar
at
least
as
many
foot
above
her
head
as
she
be
high
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
double
-
cap
great
-
coat
on
,
and
over
my
arm
another
thick
coat
.
<EOS>
that
I
get
them
off
,
close
with
her
,
throw
her
down
,
and
get
them
over
her
;
that
I
drag
the
great
cloth
from
the
table
for
the
same
purpose
,
and
with
it
drag
down
the
heap
of
rottenness
in
the
midst
,
and
all
the
ugly
thing
that
shelter
there
;
that
we
be
on
the
ground
struggle
like
desperate
enemy
,
and
that
the
closer
I
cover
her
,
the
more
wildly
she
shriek
and
try
to
free
herself
;
that
this
occur
I
know
through
the
result
,
but
not
through
anything
I
feel
,
or
think
,
or
know
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
until
I
know
that
we
be
on
the
floor
by
the
great
table
,
and
that
patch
of
tinder
yet
alight
be
float
in
the
smoky
air
,
which
,
a
moment
ago
,
have
be
her
fade
bridal
dress
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
I
look
round
and
see
the
disturbed
beetle
and
spider
run
away
over
the
floor
,
and
the
servant
come
in
with
breathless
cry
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
still
hold
her
forcibly
down
with
all
my
strength
,
like
a
prisoner
who
may
escape
;
and
I
doubt
if
I
even
know
who
she
be
,
or
why
we
have
struggle
,
or
that
she
have
be
in
flame
,
or
that
the
flame
be
out
,
until
I
see
the
patch
of
tinder
that
have
be
her
garment
,
no
longer
alight
but
fall
in
a
black
shower
around
us
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
insensible
,
and
I
be
afraid
to
have
her
move
,
or
even
touch
.
<EOS>
assistance
be
send
for
and
I
hold
her
until
it
come
,
as
if
I
unreasonably
fancy
(
I
think
I
do
)
that
if
I
let
her
go
,
the
fire
would
break
out
again
and
consume
her
.
<EOS>
when
I
get
up
,
on
the
surgeon
be
come
to
her
with
other
aid
,
I
be
astonish
to
see
that
both
my
hand
be
burn
;
for
,
I
have
no
knowledge
of
it
through
the
sense
of
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
on
examination
it
be
pronounce
that
she
have
receive
serious
hurt
but
that
they
of
themselves
be
far
from
hopeless
;
the
danger
lie
mainly
in
the
nervous
shock
.
<EOS>
by
the
surgeon
's
direction
,
her
bed
be
carry
into
that
room
and
lay
upon
the
great
table
:
which
happen
to
be
well
suited
to
the
dressing
of
her
injury
.
<EOS>
when
I
see
her
again
,
an
hour
afterwards
,
she
lie
indeed
where
I
have
see
her
strike
her
stick
,
and
have
hear
her
say
that
she
would
lie
one
day
.
  
<EOS>
though
every
vestige
of
her
dress
be
burn
,
as
they
tell
me
,
she
still
have
something
of
her
old
ghastly
bridal
appearance
;
for
,
they
have
cover
her
to
the
throat
with
white
cotton
-
wool
,
and
as
she
lie
with
a
white
sheet
loosely
overlie
that
,
the
phantom
air
of
something
that
have
be
and
be
change
,
be
still
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
,
on
question
the
servant
,
that
Estella
be
in
Paris
,
and
I
get
a
promise
from
the
surgeon
that
he
would
write
to
her
by
the
next
post
.
<EOS>
Miss
Havisham
's
family
<EOS>
I
take
upon
myself
;
intend
to
communicate
with
Mr
Matthew
Pocket
only
,
and
leave
him
to
do
as
he
like
about
inform
the
rest
.
<EOS>
this
I
do
next
day
,
through
Herbert
,
as
soon
as
I
return
to
town
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
stage
,
that
evening
,
when
she
speak
collectedly
of
what
have
happen
,
though
with
a
certain
terrible
vivacity
.
<EOS>
towards
midnight
she
begin
to
wander
in
her
speech
,
and
after
that
it
gradually
set
in
that
she
say
innumerable
time
in
a
low
solemn
voice
,
"
what
have
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
when
she
first
come
,
I
mean
to
save
her
from
misery
like
mine
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
---
take
the
pencil
and
write
under
my
name
,
"
I
forgive
her
!
"
<EOS>
"
She
never
change
the
order
of
these
three
sentence
,
but
she
sometimes
leave
out
a
word
in
one
or
other
of
them
;
never
put
in
another
word
,
but
always
leave
a
blank
and
go
on
to
the
next
word
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
could
do
no
service
there
,
and
as
I
have
,
nearer
home
,
that
press
reason
for
anxiety
and
fear
which
even
her
wandering
could
not
drive
out
of
my
mind
,
I
decide
in
the
course
of
the
night
that
I
would
return
by
the
early
morning
coach
:
walk
on
a
mile
or
so
,
and
be
take
up
clear
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
at
about
six
o'clock
of
the
morning
,
therefore
,
I
lean
over
her
and
touch
her
lip
with
mine
,
just
as
they
say
,
not
stop
for
be
touch
,
"
take
the
pencil
and
write
under
my
name
,
---"I
forgive
her

Chapter
50
 
my
hand
have
be
dress
twice
or
thrice
in
the
night
,
and
again
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
My
left
arm
be
a
good
deal
burn
to
the
elbow
,
and
,
less
severely
,
as
high
as
the
shoulder
;
it
be
very
painful
,
but
the
flame
have
set
in
that
direction
,
and
I
feel
thankful
it
be
no
bad
.
<EOS>
My
right
hand
be
not
so
badly
burn
but
that
I
could
move
the
finger
.
<EOS>
It
be
bandage
,
of
course
,
but
much
less
inconveniently
than
my
left
hand
and
arm
;
those
I
carry
in
a
sling
;
and
I
could
only
wear
my
coat
like
a
cloak
,
loose
over
my
shoulder
and
fasten
at
the
neck
.
<EOS>
My
hair
have
be
catch
by
the
fire
,
but
not
my
head
or
face
.
  
<EOS>
when
Herbert
have
be
down
to
Hammersmith
and
see
his
father
,
he
come
back
to
me
at
our
chamber
,
and
devote
the
day
to
attend
on
me
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
kind
of
nurse
,
and
at
stated
time
take
off
the
bandage
,
and
steep
them
in
the
cool
liquid
that
be
keep
ready
,
and
put
them
on
again
,
with
a
patient
tenderness
that
I
be
deeply
grateful
for
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
,
as
I
lie
quiet
on
the
sofa
,
I
find
it
painfully
difficult
,
I
may
say
impossible
,
to
get
rid
of
the
impression
of
the
glare
of
the
flame
,
their
hurry
and
noise
,
and
the
fierce
burning
smell
.
<EOS>
if
I
doze
for
a
minute
,
I
be
awaken
by
Miss
Havisham
's
cry
,
and
by
her
run
at
me
with
all
that
height
of
fire
above
her
head
.
<EOS>
this
pain
of
the
mind
be
much
hard
to
strive
against
than
any
bodily
pain
I
suffer
;
and
Herbert
,
see
that
,
do
his
utmost
to
hold
my
attention
engage
.
  
<EOS>
neither
of
us
speak
of
the
boat
,
but
we
both
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
that
be
make
apparent
by
our
avoidance
of
the
subject
,
and
by
our
agreeing
---
without
agreement
---
to
make
my
recovery
of
the
use
of
my
hand
,
a
question
of
so
many
hour
,
not
of
so
many
week
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
question
when
I
see
Herbert
have
be
of
course
,
whether
all
be
well
down
the
river
?
<EOS>
as
he
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
with
perfect
confidence
and
cheerfulness
,
we
do
not
resume
the
subject
until
the
day
be
wear
away
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
as
Herbert
change
the
bandage
,
more
by
the
light
of
the
fire
than
by
the
outer
light
,
he
go
back
to
it
spontaneously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
sit
with
Provis
last
night
,
Handel
,
two
good
hour

<EOS>
"

"
She
be
up
and
down
with
Gruffandgrim
all
the
evening
.
<EOS>
He
be
perpetually
peg
at
the
floor
,
the
moment
she
leave
his
sight
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
he
can
hold
out
long
though
.
<EOS>
what
with
rum
and
pepper
---
and
pepper
and
rum
---
I
should
think
his
pegging
must
be
nearly
over
.

then
you
will
be
marry
,
Herbert
?
<EOS>
"

how
can
I
take
care

the

lay
your
arm
out
upon
the
back
of
the
sofa
,
my
dear
boy

I
will
sit
down
here
,
and
get
the
bandage
off
<EOS>
so
gradually
that
you
shall
not
know
when
it
come

you
know

I

to
you

soften

last
see
him

<EOS>
"
so
you
do
.
<EOS>
and
so
he

He
be
very
communicative
last
night
,
and
tell
me
more
of
his

<EOS>
You
remember
his
breaking
off
here
about
some
woman
that
he
have
have
great
trouble
with
.
<EOS>
---
do
I
hurt
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
start
,
but
not
under
his
touch
.
<EOS>
His
word
have
give
me
a
start
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
forget
that
,
Herbert

but
I
remember
it
now
you
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well

He
go
into
that
part
of
his
life
,
and
a
dark
wild
part
it
be
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you

would
it
worry
you
just
now

every

<EOS>
Herbert
bend
forward
to
look
at
me
more
nearly
,
as
if
my
reply
have
be
rather
more
hurried
or
more
eager
than
he
could
quite
account
for

Your

cool

harder

It
be
clear
last
night
that
this
barb
the
point
of
Provis

animosity

<EOS>

I

remember

what

as
to
that

His
expression
be

It
have
happen
some
three

four

you
bring
into
his
mind
the
little
girl

tragically
lose

have

about
your
age

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Herbert
,
"
say
I
,
after
a
short
silence
,
in
a
hurried
way
,
"
can
you
see
me
best
by
the
light
of
the
window

the
light
of

fire

close

chapter
51
 
<EOS>
what
purpose
I
have
in
view
when
I
be
hot
on
trace
out
and
prove
Estella
's
parentage
,
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
It
will
presently
be
see
that
the
question
be
not
before
me
in
a
distinct
shape
,
until
it
be
put
before
me
by
a
wise
head
than
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
when
Herbert
and
I
have
hold
our
momentous
conversation
,
I
be
seize
with
a
feverish
conviction
that
I
ought
to
hunt
the
matter
down
---
that
I
ought
not
to
let
it
rest
,
but
that
I
ought
to
see
Mr
Jaggers
,
and
come
at
the
bare
truth
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
know
whether
I
feel
that
I
do
this
for
Estella
's
sake
,
or
whether
I
be
glad
to
transfer
to
the
man
in
whose
preservation
I
be
so
much
concerned
,
some
ray
of
the
romantic
interest
that
have
so
long
surround
her
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
latter
possibility
may
be
the
nearer
to
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
any
way
,
I
could
scarcely
be
withhold
from
go
out
to
Gerrard
-
street
that
night
.
<EOS>
Herbert
's
representation
that
if
I
do
,
I
should
probably
be
lay
up
and
stricken
useless
,
when
our
fugitive
's
safety
would
depend
upon
me
,
alone
restrain
my
impatience
.
<EOS>
on
the
understanding
,
again
and
again
reiterate
,
that
come
what
would
,
I
be
to
go
to
Mr
Jaggers
to
-
morrow
,
I
at
length
submit
to
keep
quiet
,
and
to
have
my
hurt
look
after
,
and
to
stay
at
home
.
<EOS>
early
next
morning
we
go
out
together
,
and
at
the
corner
of
Giltspur
-
street
by
Smithfield
,
I
leave
Herbert
to
go
his
way
into
the
city
,
and
take
my
way
to
Little
Britain
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
periodical
occasion
when
Mr
Jaggers
and
Wemmick
go
over
the
office
account
,
and
check
off
the
voucher
,
and
put
all
thing
straight
.
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
Wemmick
take
his
book
and
paper
into
Mr
Jaggers
's
room
,
and
one
of
the
up
-
stair
clerk
come
down
into
the
outer
office
.
<EOS>
find
such
clerk
on
Wemmick
's
post
that
morning
,
I
know
what
be
go
on
;
but
,
I
be
not
sorry
to
have
Mr
Jaggers
and
Wemmick
together
,
as
Wemmick
would
then
hear
for
himself
that
I
say
nothing
to
compromise
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
appearance
with
my
arm
bandage
and
my
coat
loose
over
my
shoulder
,
favour
my
object
.
<EOS>
although
I
have
send
Mr
Jaggers
a
brief
account
of
the
accident
as
soon
as
I
have
arrive
in
town
,
yet
I
have
to
give
him
all
the
detail
now
;
and
the
speciality
of
the
occasion
cause
our
talk
to
be
less
dry
and
hard
,
and
less
strictly
regulate
by
the
rule
of
evidence
,
than
it
have
be
before
.
<EOS>
while
I
describe
the
disaster
,
Mr
Jaggers
stand
,
accord
to
his
will
not
,
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Wemmick
lean
back
in
his
chair
,
stare
at
me
,
with
his
hand
in
the
pocket
of
his
trouser
,
and
his
pen
put
horizontally
into
the
post
.
<EOS>
the
two
brutal
cast
,
always
inseparable
in
my
mind
from
the
official
proceeding
,
seem
to
be
congestively
consider
whether
they
do
not
smell
fire
at
the
present
moment
.
  
<EOS>
My
narrative
finish
,
and
their
question
exhaust
<EOS>
,
I
then
produce
Miss
Havisham
's
authority
to
receive
the
nine
hundred
pound
for
Herbert
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
's
eye
retire
a
little
deep
into
his
head
when
I
hand
him
the
tablet
,
but
he
presently
hand
them
over
to
Wemmick
,
with
instruction
to
draw
the
cheque
for
his
signature
.
<EOS>
while
that
be
in
course
of
be
do
,
I
look
on
at
Wemmick
as
he
write
,
and
Mr
Jaggers
,
poise
and
sway
himself
on
his
well
-
polish
boot
,
look
on
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
,
Pip
,
"
say
he
,
as
I
put
the
cheque
in
my
pocket
,
when
he
have
sign
it
,
"
that
we
do
nothing
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Havisham
be
good
enough
to
ask
me
,
"
I
return
,
"
whether
she
could
do
nothing
for
me
,
and
I
tell
her
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
everybody
should
know
his
own
business
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
.
<EOS>
and
I
see
Wemmick
's
lip
form
the
word
"
portable
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
 
\
not
\
 
have
tell
her
no
,
if
I
have
be
you
,

say
Mr
Jaggers
;

every
man
ought
to
know
his
own
business
best

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
every
man
's
business

say
Wemmick
,
rather
reproachfully
towards
me
,
"
be
portable
property

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
I
think
the
time
be
now
come
for
pursue
the
theme
I
have
at
heart
,
I
say
,
turn
on
Mr
Jaggers
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
ask
something
of
Miss
Havisham
,
however
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
ask
her
to
give
me
some
information
relative
to
her
adopt
daughter
,
and
she
give
he
all
she
possess
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
she
?
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
bend
forward
to
look
at
his
boot
and
then
straighten
himself
.
"
<EOS>
hah
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
should
have
do
so
,
if
I
have
be
Miss
Havisham
.
<EOS>
but
 
\
<EOS>
she
\
 
<EOS>
ought
to
know
her
own
business
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
more
of
the
history
of
Miss
Havisham
's
adopted
child
than
Miss
Havisham
herself
do
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
know
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
look
at
me
inquiringly
,
and
repeat
"
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
her
mother
within
these
three
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
?
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
so
have
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
and
you
have
see
her
still
more
recently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
?
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
know
more
of
Estella
's
history
than
even
you
do
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
I
know
her
father
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
certain
stop
that
Mr
Jaggers
come
to
in
his
manner
<EOS>
---
he
be
too
self
-
possess
to
change
his
manner
,
but
he
could
not
help
its
be
bring
to
an
indefinably
attentive
stop
---
assure
me
that
he
do
not
know
who
her
father
be
.
<EOS>
this
I
have
strongly
suspect
from
Provis
's
account
<EOS>
(
as
Herbert
have
repeat
it
)
of
his
have
keep
himself
dark
;
which
I
piece
on
to
the
fact
that
he
himself
be
not
Mr
Jaggers
's
client
until
some
four
year
later
,
and
when
he
could
have
no
reason
for
claim
his
identity
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
could
not
be
sure
of
this
unconsciousness
on
Mr
Jaggers
's
part
before
,
though
I
be
quite
sure
of
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
!
<EOS>
You
know
the
young
lady
's
father
,
Pip
?
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
reply
,
"
and
his
name
be
Provis
---
from
New
South
Wales
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
even
Mr
Jaggers
start
when
I
say
those
word
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
slight
start
that
could
escape
a
man
,
the
most
carefully
repressed
and
the
soon
check
,
but
he
do
start
,
though
he
make
it
a
part
of
the
action
of
take
out
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
how
Wemmick
receive
the
announcement
I
be
unable
to
say
,
for
I
be
afraid
to
look
at
him
just
then
,
lest
Mr
Jaggers
's
sharpness
should
detect
that
there
have
be
some
communication
unknown
to
him
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
on
what
evidence
,
Pip
,
"
ask
Mr.
Jaggers
,
very
coolly
,
as
he
pause
with
his
handkerchief
half
way
to
his
nose
,
"
do
provi
make
this
claim
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
do
not
make
it
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
have
never
make
it
,
and
have
no
knowledge
or
belief
that
his
daughter
be
in
existence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
for
once
,
the
powerful
pocket
-
handkerchief
fail
.
<EOS>
My
reply
be
so
unexpected
that
Mr
Jaggers
put
the
handkerchief
back
into
his
pocket
without
complete
the
usual
performance
,
fold
his
arm
and
look
with
stern
attention
at
me
,
though
with
an
immovable
face
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
tell
him
all
I
know
,
and
how
I
know
it
;
with
the
one
reservation
that
I
leave
him
to
infer
that
I
know
from
Miss
Havisham
what
I
in
fact
know
from
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
careful
indeed
as
to
that
.
<EOS>
nor
,
do
I
look
towards
Wemmick
until
I
have
finish
all
I
have
to
tell
,
and
have
be
for
some
time
silently
meet
Mr
Jaggers
's
look
.
<EOS>
when
I
do
at
last
turn
my
eye
in
Wemmick
's
direction
<EOS>
,
I
find
that
he
have
unposte
his
pen
,
and
be
intent
upon
the
table
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
hah
!
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
at
last
,
as
he
move
towards
the
paper
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
---
what
item
be
it
<EOS>
you
be
at
,
Wemmick
,
when
Mr.
Pip
come
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
submit
to
be
throw
off
in
that
way
,
and
I
make
a
passionate
,
almost
an
indignant
,
appeal
to
him
to
be
more
frank
and
manly
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
remind
him
of
the
false
hope
into
which
I
have
lapse
,
the
length
of
time
they
have
last
,
and
the
discovery
I
have
make
:
<EOS>
and
I
hint
at
the
danger
that
weigh
upon
my
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
represent
myself
as
be
surely
worthy
of
some
little
confidence
from
him
,
in
return
for
the
confidence
I
have
just
now
impart
.
<EOS>
I
say
that
I
do
not
blame
him
,
or
suspect
him
,
or
mistrust
him
,
but
I
want
assurance
of
the
truth
from
him
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
ask
me
why
I
want
it
<EOS>
and
why
I
think
I
have
any
right
to
it
<EOS>
,
I
would
tell
him
,
little
as
he
care
for
such
poor
dream
,
that
I
have
love
Estella
dearly
and
long
,
and
that
,
although
I
have
lose
her
and
must
live
a
bereave
life
,
whatever
concern
her
be
still
near
and
dearer
to
me
than
anything
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
and
see
that
Mr
Jaggers
stand
quite
still
and
silent
,
and
apparently
quite
obdurate
,
under
this
appeal
,
I
turn
to
Wemmick
,
and
say
,
"
Wemmick
,
I
know
you
to
be
a
man
with
a
gentle
heart
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
your
pleasant
home
,
and
your
old
father
,
and
all
the
innocent
cheerful
playful
way
with
which
you
refresh
your
business
life
.
<EOS>
and
I
entreat
you
to
say
a
word
for
me
to
Mr
Jaggers
,
and
to
represent
to
him
that
,
all
circumstance
consider
,
he
ought
to
be
more
open
with
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
two
man
look
more
oddly
at
one
another
than
Mr
Jaggers
and
Wemmick
<EOS>
do
after
this
apostrophe
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
a
misgiving
cross
me
that
Wemmick
would
be
instantly
dismiss
from
his
employment
;
but
,
it
melt
as
I
see
Mr
Jaggers
relax
into
something
like
a
smile
,
and
Wemmick
become
bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
all
this
?
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
.
<EOS>
"
You
with
an
old
father
,
and
you
with
pleasant
and
playful
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
well
!
"
return
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
do
not
bring
'em
here
,
what
do
it
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pip
,
"
say
Mr
Jaggers
,
lay
his
hand
upon
my
arm
,
and
smile
openly
<EOS>
,
"
this
man
must
be
the
most
cunning
impostor
in
all
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
a
bit
of
it
,
"
return
Wemmick
,
grow
bolder
and
bold
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
another

she
would

safe
where
she
be

for
the
daughter

I
think
it
would
hardly
serve
her
,
to
establish
her
parentage
for
the
information
of
her
husband
,
and
to
drag
her
back
to
disgrace
,
after
an
escape
of
twenty
year
,
pretty
secure
to
last
for
life
.
<EOS>
but
,
add
the
case
that
you
have
love
her
,
Pip
,
and
have
make
her
the
subject
of
those
"
poor
dream
"
which
have
,
at
one
time
or
another
,
be
in
the
head
of
more
man
than
you
think
likely
,
then
I
tell
you
that
you
have
well
---
and
would
much
sooner
when
you
have
think
well
of
it
---
chop
off
that
bandage
<EOS>
left
hand
of
yours
with
your
bandage
right
hand
,
and
then
pass
the
chopper
on
to
Wemmick
there
,
to
cut
 
\
<EOS>
that
\
 
off
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
at
Wemmick
,
whose
face
be
very
grave
.
<EOS>
He
gravely
touch
his
lip
with
his
forefinger
.
<EOS>
I
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
do
the
same
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
Wemmick
,
"
say
the
latter
then
,
resume
his
usual
manner
<EOS>
,
"
what
item
be
it
<EOS>
you
be
at
,
when
Mr
Pip
come
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
stand
by
for
a
little
,
while
they
be
at
work
,
I
observe
that
the
odd
look
they
have
cast
at
one
another
be
repeat
several
time
:
with
this
difference
now
,
that
each
of
them
seem
suspicious
,
not
to
say
conscious
,
of
have
show
himself
in
a
weak
and
unprofessional
light
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
I
suppose
,
they
be
now
inflexible
with
one
another
;
Mr
Jaggers
be
highly
dictatorial
,
and
Wemmick
obstinately
justify
himself
whenever
there
be
the
small
point
in
abeyance
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
them
on
such
ill
term
;
for
generally
they
get
on
very
well
indeed
together
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
they
be
both
happily
relieve
by
the
opportune
appearance
of
Mike
,
the
client
with
the
fur
cap
and
the
habit
of
wipe
his
nose
on
his
sleeve
,
whom
I
have
see
on
the
very
first
day
of
my
appearance
within
those
wall
.
<EOS>
this
individual
,
who
,
either
in
his
own
person
or
in
that
of
some
member
of
his
family
,
seem
to
be
always
in
trouble
(
which
in
that
place
mean
Newgate
)
,
call
to
announce
that
his
eld
daughter
be
take
up
on
suspicion
of
shop
-
lifting

<EOS>
as
he
impart
this
melancholy
circumstance
to
Wemmick
,
Mr
Jaggers
stand
magisterially
before
the
fire
and
take
no
share
in
the
proceeding
,
Mike
's
eye
happen
to
twinkle
with
a
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
about
?
<EOS>
"
demand
Wemmick
,
with
the
utmost
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
come
snivel
here
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

You
do

how
dare
you
?
<EOS>
You
be
not
in
a
fit
state
to
come
here
,
if
you
can
not
come
here
without
splutter
like
a
bad
pen

<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
by
it
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
a

can
not
help
his

plead
Mike

<EOS>
"
His
what
?
<EOS>
"
demand
Wemmick
,
quite
savagely
.
<EOS>
"
say
that
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
look
here
my
man

"
say
Mr

,
advance
a
step
,
and
point
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
get
out

so
the
unfortunate
Mike
very
humbly
withdraw
,

Mr

Wemmick
appear
to
have
re
-
establish
their
good
understanding

go
to

again
with
an
air
of
refreshment
upon
them
as
if
they
have
just
have

from

Britain

I
go

with
my
cheque
in
my

to
Miss
Skiffins

the

and
Miss

go
straight
to
Clarriker

and
bring
Clarriker
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
have
the
great
satisfaction
of
conclude
that
arrangement
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
good
thing
I
have
do
,
and
the
only
complete
thing
I
have
do
,
since
I
be
first
apprise
of
my
great
expectation

<EOS>
clarriker
inform
me
on
that
occasion
that
the
affair
of
the
House
be
steadily
progress
,
that
he
would
now
be
able
to
establish
a
small
branch
-
house
in
the
East
which
be
much
want
for
the
extension
of
the
business
,
and
that
Herbert
in
his
new
partnership
capacity
would
go
out
and
take
charge
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
find
that
I
must
have
prepare
for
a
separation
from
my
friend
,
even
though
my
own
affair
have
be
more
settle
.
<EOS>
and
now
indeed
I
feel
as
if
my
last
anchor
be
loosen
its
hold
,
and
I
should
soon
be
drive
with
the
wind
and
wave
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
there
be
recompense
in
the
joy
with
which
Herbert
would
come
home
of
a
night
and
tell
me
of
these
change
,
<EOS>
little
imagining
that
he
tell
me
no
news
,
and
would
sketch
airy
picture
of
himself
conduct
Clara
Barley
to
the
land
of
the
Arabian
Nights
,
and
of
me
go
out
to
join
them
(
with
a
caravan
of
camel
,
I
believe
)
,
and
of
our
all
go
up
the
Nile
and
see
wonder
.
<EOS>
without
be
sanguine
as
to
my
own
part
in
these
bright
plan
,
I
feel
that
Herbert
's
way
be
clear
fast
,
and
that
old
Bill
Barley
have
but
to
stick
to
his
pepper
and
rum
,
and
his

would
soon
be
happily

<EOS>
We
have
now

<EOS>
My

no

take
in

<EOS>
on
a
Monday
morning

when
Herbert

I

the

when
I
have
show
this

have
put
it
in

not
before
we
have
both
get
it
by

we
consider
what
to

for

of
course
my

<EOS>
"
I
have
think
it
over

again

again

say
Herbert
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
I
know
a

I
have

more
than

<EOS>
"
but
how
much
would
you
tell

Herbert

"
  
<EOS>

It
be
necessary
to
tell
him
very
little
.
<EOS>
let
him
suppose
it
a
mere
freak
,
but
a
secret
one
,
until
the

come
:
then
let
him
know
that
there
be
urgent
reason
for
your

away

You
go
with

"
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
have
seem
to
me
,
in
the
many
anxious
consideration
I
have
give
the
point
,
almost
indifferent
what
port
we
make
for
---
Hamburg
,
Rotterdam
,
Antwerp
---
the
place
signify
little
,
so
that
he
be
get
out
of
England
.
<EOS>
any
foreign
steamer
that
fall
in
our
way
and
would
take
us
up
,
would
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
propose
to
myself
to
get
him
well
down
the
river
in
the
boat
;
certainly
well
beyond
Gravesend
,
which
be
a
critical
place
for
search
or
inquiry
if
suspicion
be
afoot
.
<EOS>
as
foreign
steamer
would
leave
London
at
about
the
time
of
high
-
water
,
our
plan
would
be
to
get
down
the
river
by
a
previous
ebb
-
tide
,
and
lie
by
in
some
quiet
spot
until
we
could
pull
off
to
one
.
<EOS>
the
time
when
one
would
be
due
where
we
lay
,
wherever
that
may
be
,
could
be
calculate
pretty
nearly
,
if
we
make
inquiry
beforehand
.
  
<EOS>
Herbert
assent
to
all
this
,
and
we
go
out
immediately
after
breakfast
to
pursue
our
investigation
.
<EOS>
We
find
that
a
steamer
for
Hamburg
be
likely
to
suit
our
purpose
best
,
and
we
direct
our
thought
chiefly
to
that
vessel
.
<EOS>
but
we
note
down
what
other
foreign
steamer
would
leave
London
with
the
same
tide
,
and
we
satisfy
ourselves
that
we
know
the
build
and
colour
of
each
.
<EOS>
We
then
separate
for
a
few
hour
;
I
,
to
get
at
once
such
passport
as
be
necessary
;
Herbert
,
to
see
Startop
at
his
lodging
.
<EOS>
We
both
do
what
we
have
to
do
without
any
hindrance
,
and
when
we
meet
again
at
one
o'clock
report
it
do
.
<EOS>
I
,
for
my
part
,
be
prepare
with
passport
;
Herbert
have
see
Startop
,
and
he
be
more
than
ready
to
join
.
  
<EOS>
those
two
should
pull
a
pair
of
oar
,
we
settle
,
and
I
would
steer
;
our
charge
would
be
sitter
,
and
keep
quiet
;
as
speed
be
not
our
object
,
we
should
make
way
enough
.
<EOS>
We
arrange
that
Herbert
should
not
come
home
to
dinner
before
go
to
Mill
Pond
Bank
<EOS>
that
evening
;
that
he
should
not
go
there
at
all
,
to
-
morrow
evening
,
Tuesday
;
that
he
should
prepare
Provis
to
come
down
to
some
stair
hard
by
the
house
,
on
Wednesday
,
when
he
see
us
approach
,
and
not
sooner
;
that
all
the
arrangement
with
him
should
be
conclude
that
Monday
night
;
and
that
he
should
be
communicate
with
no
more
in
any
way
,
until
we
take
him
on
board
.
  
<EOS>
these
precaution
well
understand
by
both
of
us
,
I
go
home
.
  
<EOS>
on
open
the
outer
door
of
our
chamber
with
my
key
,
I
find
a
letter
in
the
box
,
direct
to
me
;
a
very
dirty
letter
,
though
not
ill
-
write
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
deliver
by
hand
(
of
course
since
I
leave
home
)
,
and
its
content
be
these
:
  
"
if
you
be
not
afraid
to
come
to
the
old
marsh
to
-
night
or
to
-
morrow
night
at
nine
,
and
to
come
to
the
little
sluice
-
house
by
the
limekiln
,
you
have
better
come
.
<EOS>
if
you
want
information
regard
 
\
<EOS>
your
uncle
Provis
,
\
 
<EOS>
you
have
much
better
come
and
tell
no
one
and
lose
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
You
must
come
alone
.
<EOS>
\
 
<EOS>
bring
this
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
have
load
enough
upon
my
mind
before
the
receipt
of
this
strange
letter
.
<EOS>
what
to
do
now
,
I
could
not
tell
.
<EOS>
and
the
bad
be
,
that
I
must
decide
quickly
,
or
I
should
miss
the
afternoon
coach
,
which
would
take
me
down
in
time
for
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
night
I
could
not
think
of
go
,
for
it
would
be
too
close
upon
the
time
of
the
flight
.
<EOS>
and
again
,
for
anything
I
know
,
the
proffer
information
may
have
some
important
bearing
on
the
flight
itself
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
have
ample
time
for
consideration
,
I
believe
I
should
still
have
go
.
<EOS>
have
hardly
any
time
for
consideration
---
my
watch
show
me
that
the
coach
start
within
half
an
hour
---
I
resolve
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
not
have
go
,
but
for
the
reference
to
my
Uncle
Provis
;
that
,
come
on
Wemmick
's
letter
and
the
morning
's
busy
preparation
,
turn
the
scale
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
so
difficult
to
become
clearly
possess
of
the
content
of
almost
any
letter
,
in
a
violent
hurry
,
that
I
have
to
read
this
mysterious
epistle
again
,
twice
,
before
its
injunction
to
he
to
be
secret
get
mechanically
into
my
mind
.
<EOS>
yield
to
it
in
the
same
mechanical
kind
of
way
,
I
leave
a
note
in
pencil
for
Herbert
,
tell
him
that
as
I
should
be
so
soon
go
away
,
I
know
not
for
how
long
,
I
have
decide
to
hurry
down
and
back
,
to
ascertain
for
myself
how
Miss
Havisham
be
fare
.
<EOS>
I
have
then
barely
time
to
get
my
great
-
coat
,
lock
up
the
chamber
,
and
make
for
the
coach
-
office
by
the
short
by
-
way
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
take
a
hackney
-
chariot
and
go
by
the
street
,
I
should
have
miss
my
aim
;
go
as
I
do
<EOS>
,
I
catch
the
coach
just
as
it
come
out
of
the
yard
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
only
inside
passenger
,
jolt
away
knee
-
deep
in
straw
,
when
I
come
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
for
,
I
really
have
not
be
myself
since
the
receipt
of
the
letter
;
it
have
<EOS>
so
bewilder
me
ensue
on
the
hurry
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
morning
hurry
and
flutter
have
be
great
,
for
,
long
and
anxiously
as
I
have
wait
for
Wemmick
,
his
hint
have
come
like
a
surprise
at
last
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
I
begin
to
wonder
at
myself
for
be
in
the
coach
,
and
to
doubt
whether
I
have
sufficient
reason
for
be
there
,
and
to
consider
whether
I
should
get
out
presently
and
go
back
,
and
to
argue
against
ever
heed
an
anonymous
communication
,
and
,
in
short
,
to
pass
through
all
those
phase
of
contradiction
and
indecision
to
which
I
suppose
very
few
hurried
people
be
stranger
.
<EOS>
still
,
the
reference
to
Provis
by
name
,
master
everything
.
<EOS>
I
reason
as
I
have
reason
already
without
know
it
---
if
that
be
reason
---
in
case
any
harm
should
befall
him
through
my
not
go
,
how
could
I
ever
forgive
myself
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
dark
before
we
get
down
,
and
the
journey
seem
long
and
dreary
to
me
who
could
see
little
of
it
inside
,
and
who
could
not
go
outside
in
my
disabled
state
.
<EOS>
avoid
the
Blue
Boar
,
I
put
up
at
an
inn
of
minor
reputation
down
the
town
,
and
order
some
dinner
.
<EOS>
while
it
be
prepare
,
I
go
to
Satis
House
and
inquire
for
Miss
Havisham
;
she
be
still
very
ill
,
though
consider
something
well
.
  
<EOS>
My
inn
have
once
be
a
part
of
an
ancient
ecclesiastical
house
,
and
I
dine
in
a
little
octagonal
common
-
room
,
like
a
font
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
not
able
to
cut
my
dinner
,
the
old
landlord
with
a
shine
bald
head
do
it
for
me
.
<EOS>
this
bring
us
into
conversation
,
he
be
so
good
as
to
entertain
me
with
my
own
story
---
of
course
with
the
popular
feature
that
Pumblechook
be
my
early
benefactor
and
the
founder
of
my
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
the
young
man
?
"
say
I.
  
"
<EOS>
know
him
!
"
repeat
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ever
since
he
be
---
no
height
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
he
ever
come
back
to
this
neighbourhood
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
he
come
back
,
"
say
the
landlord
,
"
to
his
great
friend
,
now
and
again
,
and
give
the
cold
shoulder
to
the
man
that
make
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
man
be
that
?
"
  
"
Him
that
I
speak
of
,
"
say
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
ungrateful
to
no
one
else
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
he
would
be
,
if
he
could
,
"
return
the
landlord
,
"
but
he
can
not
.
<EOS>
and
why
?
<EOS>
because
Pumblechook
do
everything
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Pumblechook
say
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
say
so
!
<EOS>
"
reply
the
landlord
.
"
<EOS>
He
han't
no
call
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
do
he
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
turn
a
man
's
blood
to
white
wine
winegar
to
hear
him
tell
of
it
,
sir
,
"
say
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
"
yet
Joe
,
dear
Joe
,
you
never
tell
of
it

<EOS>
long

suffer
and
love
Joe

\
you

never

you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
appetite
be
be
touch
like
,
by
your
accident

say
the
landlord

glance
at
the
bandage
arm
under
my
coat
.
<EOS>
"
try
a
tenderer
bit
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
thank
you

"
I
reply
,
turn
from
the
table
to
brood
over
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
eat
no
more
.
<EOS>
please
take
it
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
never
be
strike
at
so
keenly
,
for
my
thanklessness
to
Joe
,
as
through
the
brazen
impostor
Pumblechook
.
<EOS>
the
falser
he
,
the
truer
Joe
;
the
mean
he
,
the
noble
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
be
deeply
and
most
deservedly
humble
as
I
muse
over
the
fire
for
an
hour
or
more
.
<EOS>
the
striking
of
the
clock
arouse
me
,
but
not
from
my
dejection
or
remorse
,
and
I
get
up
and
have
my
coat
fasten
round
my
neck
,
and
go
out
.
<EOS>
I
have
previously
seek
in
my
pocket
for
the
letter
,
that
I
may
refer
to
it
again
,
but
I
could
not
find
it
,
and
be
uneasy
to
think
that
it
must
have
be
drop
in
the
straw
of
the
coach
.
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
,
however
,
that
the
appoint
place
be
the
little
sluice
-
house
by
the
limekiln
on
the
marsh
,
and
the
hour
nine
.
<EOS>
towards
the
marsh
I
now
go
straight
,
have
no
time
to
spare
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
53
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
dark
night
,
though
the
full
moon
rise
as
I
leave
the
enclose
land
,
and
pass
out
upon
the
marsh
.
<EOS>
beyond
their
dark
line
there
be
a
ribbon
of
clear
sky
,
hardly
broad
enough
to
hold
the
red
large
moon
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
she
have
ascend
out
of
that
clear
field
,
in
among
the
pile
mountain
of
cloud
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
melancholy
wind
,
and
the
marsh
be
very
dismal
.
<EOS>
a
stranger
would
have
find
them
insupportable
,
and
even
to
me
they
be
so
oppressive
that
I
hesitate
,
<EOS>
half
inclined
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
know
them
well
,
and
could
have
find
my
way
on
a
far
dark
night
,
and
have
no
excuse
for
return
,
be
there
.
<EOS>
so
,
have
come
there
against
my
inclination
,
I
go
on
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
direction
that
I
take
,
be
not
that
in
which
my
old
home
lay
,
nor
that
in
which
we
have
pursue
the
convict
.
<EOS>
My
back
be
turn
towards
the
distant
hulk
as
I
walk
on
,
and
,
though
I
could
see
the
old
light
away
on
the
spit
of
sand
,
I
see
them
over
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
limekiln
as
well
as
I
know
the
old
Battery
,
but
they
be
mile
apart
;
so
that
if
a
light
have
be
burn
at
each
point
that
night
,
there
would
have
be
a
long
strip
of
the
blank
horizon
between
the
two
bright
speck
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
,
I
have
to
shut
some
gate
after
me
,
and
now
and
then
to
stand
still
while
the
cattle
that
be
lie
in
the
bank
-
up
pathway
,
arise
and
blunder
down
among
the
grass
and
reed
.
<EOS>
but
after
a
little
while
,
I
seem
to
have
the
whole
flat
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
another
half
-
hour
before
I
draw
near
to
the
kiln
.
<EOS>
the
lime
be
burn
with
a
sluggish
stifle
smell
,
but
the
fire
be
make
up
and
leave
,
and
no
workman
be
visible
.
<EOS>
hard
by
,
be
a
small
stone
-
quarry
.
<EOS>
It
lie
directly
in
my
way
,
and
have
be
work
that
day
,
as
I
see
by
the
tool
and
barrow
that
be
lie
about
.
  
<EOS>
come
up
again
to
the
marsh
level
out
of
this
excavation
---
for
the
rude
path
lie
through
it
---
I
see
a
light
in
the
old
sluice
-
house
.
<EOS>
I
quicken
my
pace
,
and
knock
at
the
door
with
my
hand
.
<EOS>
wait
for
some
reply
,
I
look
about
me
,
notice
how
the
sluice
be
abandon
and
break
,
and
how
the
house
---
of
wood
with
a
tile
roof
---
would
not
be
proof
against
the
weather
much
longer
,
if
it
be
so
even
now
,
and
how
the
mud
and
ooze
be
coat
with
lime
,
and
how
the
choke
vapour
of
the
kiln
creep
in
a
ghostly
way
towards
me
.
<EOS>
still
there
be
no
answer
,
and
I
knock
again
.
<EOS>
no
answer
still
,
and
I
try
the
latch
.
  
<EOS>
It
rise
under
my
hand
,
and
the
door
yield
.
<EOS>
look
in
,
I
see
a
light
candle
on
a
table
,
a
bench
,
and
a
mattress
on
a
truckle
bedstead
.
<EOS>
as
there
be
a
loft
above
,
I
call
,
"
be
there
any
one
here
?
"
<EOS>
but
no
voice
answer
.
<EOS>
then
,
I
look
at
my
watch
,
and
,
find
that
it
be
past
nine
,
call
again
,
"
be
there
any
one
here
?
<EOS>
"
there
be
still
no
answer
,
I
go
out
at
the
door
,
irresolute
what
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
begin
to
rain
fast
.
<EOS>
see
nothing
save
what
I
have
see
already
,
I
turn
back
into
the
house
,
and
stand
just
within
the
shelter
of
the
doorway
,
look
out
into
the
night
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
consider
that
some
one
must
have
be
there
lately
and
must
soon
be
come
back
,
or
the
candle
would
not
be
burn
,
it
come
into
my
head
to
look
if
the
wick
be
long
.
<EOS>
I
turn
round
to
do
so
,
and
have
take
up
the
candle
in
my
hand
,
when
it
be
extinguish
by
some
violent
shock
,
and
the
next
thing
I
comprehend
,
be
,
that
I
have
be
catch
in
a
strong
running
noose
,
throw
over
my
head
from
behind
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
a
suppress
voice
with

<EOS>
not
only
be
my

pull
close
to

but
the
pressure
on
my

arm
cause
me
exquisite
pain
.

sometimes
,
a
strong

's
hand

sometimes
a
strong
man
's
breast
,
be
set
against
my
mouth
to
deaden
my
cry
,
and
with
a
hot
breath
always
close
to
me
,
I
struggle
ineffectually
in
the
dark
,
while
I
be
fasten
tight
to
the
wall
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
"
say
the
suppress
voice
with
another
oath
,
"
call
out
again

I
will
make
short
work
of
you

"
  
<EOS>
faint
and
sick
with
the
pain
of
my
injure
arm
,
bewilder
by
the
surprise
,
and
yet
conscious
how
easily
this
threat
could
be
put
in
execution
<EOS>
,
I
desist
,
and
try
to
ease
my
arm
<EOS>
be
it
ever
so
little
.
<EOS>
but
,
it
be
bind
too
tight
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
,
have
be
burn
before
,
it
be
now
be
boil
.
  
<EOS>
the
sudden
exclusion
of
the
night
and
the
substitution
of
black
darkness
in
its
place
,
warn
me
that
the
man
have
close
a
shutter
.
<EOS>
after
grope
about
for
a
little
,
he
find
the
flint
and
steel
he
want
,
and
begin
to
strike
a
light
.
<EOS>
I
strain
my
sight
upon
the
spark
that
fall
among
the
tinder
,
and
upon
which
he
breathe
and
breathe
,
match
in
hand
,
but
I
could
only
see
his
lip
,
and
the
blue
point
of
the
match
;
even
those
,
but
fitfully
.
<EOS>
the
tinder
be
damp
---
<EOS>
no
wonder
there
---
and
one
after
another
the
spark
die
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
be
in
no
hurry
,
and
strike
again
with
the
flint
and
steel
.
<EOS>
as
the
spark
fall
thick
and
bright
about
him
,
I
could
see
his
hand
,
and
touch
of
his
face
,
and
could
make
out
that
he
be
seat
and
bend
over
the
table
;
but
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
presently
I
see
his
blue
lip
again
,
breathe
on
the
tinder
,
and
then
a
flare
of
light
flash
up
,
and
show
me
Orlick
.
  
<EOS>
whom
I
have
look
for
,
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
look
for
him
.
<EOS>
see
him
,
I
feel
that
I
be
in
a
dangerous
strait
indeed
,
and
I
keep
my
eye
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
light
the
candle
from
the
flare
match
with
great
deliberation
and
drop
the
match
,
and
tread
it
out
.
<EOS>
then
,
he
put
the
candle
away
from
him
on
the
table
,
so
that
he
could
see
me
,
and
sit
with
his
arm
fold
on
the
table
and
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
make
out
that
I
be
fasten
to
a
stout
perpendicular
ladder
a
few
inch
from
the
wall
---
a
fixture
there
---
the
mean
of
ascent
to
the
loft
above
.
  
<EOS>
"

deadly

you
set
upon

in

<EOS>
His
enjoyment
of
the
spectacle
I
furnish
,
as
he
sit
with
his
arm
fold
on
the
table
,
shake
his
head
at
me
and
hug
himself
,
have
a
malignity
in
it
that
make
me
tremble

as
I
watch
him
in
silence
,
he
put
his
hand
into
the
corner
at
his
side
,
and
take
up
a
gun
with
a
brass
-
bind
stock
.
  
<EOS>
"
do

he
,
make
as

You

say
he

repeat
my

to
Biddy
in
the
last
interview
I
have
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
I
will
tell

a
piece

<EOS>
as
he
shake
his
heavy

at

with

snarl
like
a

I
feel

"
I

bring
his

down
upon

heavy
blow

and
rise
as
the
blow
fall
,
to
give
it
great
force

<EOS>
He
lean
forward
stare
at

,
slowly
unclenche
his
hand
and
draw
it
across
his
mouth
as
if
his
mouth
water

sit
down
again

dead

<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
have
come
to
the
brink
of
my
grave
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
I
look
wildly
round
my
trap
for
any
chance

escape

there
be
none

<EOS>
"
More
than

fold

on

again

suppose
what

they

"
  
<EOS>
My
mind
,
with
inconceivable
rapidity
,
follow
out
all
the
consequence
of
such
a
death
.
<EOS>
Estella
's
father
would
believe
I
have
desert
him
,
would
be
take
,
would
die
accuse
me
;
even
Herbert
would
doubt
me
,
when
he
compare
the
letter
I
have
leave
for
him
,
with
the
fact
that
I
have
call
at
Miss
Havisham
's
gate
for
only
a
moment
;
Joe
and
Biddy
would
never
know
how
sorry
I
have
be
that
night
;
none
would
ever
know
what
I
have
suffer
,
how
true
I
have
mean
to
be
,
what
an
agony
I
have
pass
through
.
<EOS>
the
death
close
before
me
be
terrible
,
but
far
more
terrible
than
death
be
the
dread
of
be
misremembered
after
death
.
<EOS>
and
so
quick
be
my
thought
,
that
I
see
myself
despise
by
unborn
generation
---
<EOS>
Estella
's
child
,
and
their
child
---
while
the
wretch
's
word
be
yet
on
his
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
wolf
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
afore
I
kill
you
like
any
other
beast
---
which
be
wot
<EOS>
I
mean
to
do
and
wot
<EOS>
I
have
tie
you
up
for
<EOS>
---
I
will
have
a
good
look
at
you
and
a
good
goad
at
you
.
<EOS>
oh
,
you
enemy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
have
pass
through
my
thought
to
cry
out
for
help
again
;
though
few
could
know
better
than
I
,
the
solitary
nature
of
the
spot
and
the
hopelessness
of
aid
.
<EOS>
but
as
he
sit
gloat
over
me
,
I
be
support
by
a
scornful
detestation
of
him
that
seal
my
lip
.
<EOS>
above
all
thing
,
I
resolve
that
I
would
not
entreat
him
,
and
that
I
would
die
make
some
last
poor
resistance
to
him
.
<EOS>
soften
as
my
thought
of
all
the
rest
of
man
be
in
that
dire
extremity
;
humbly
beseech
pardon
,
as
I
do
,
of
Heaven
;
melt
at
heart
,
as
I
be
,
by
the
thought
that
I
have
take
no
farewell
,
and
never
never
now
could
take
farewell
,
of
those
who
be
dear
to
me
,
or
could
explain
myself
to
them
,
or
ask
for
their
compassion
on
my
miserable
error
;
still
,
if
I
could
have
kill
him
,
even
in
die
,
I
would
have
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
drink
,
and
his
eye
be
red
and
bloodshot
.
<EOS>
around
his
neck
be
sling
a
tin
bottle
,
as
I
have
often
see
his
meat
and
drink
sling
about
him
in
other
day
.
<EOS>
He
bring
the
bottle
to
his
lip
,
and
take
a
fiery
drink
from
it
;
and
I
smell
the
strong
spirit
that
I
see
flash
into
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wolf
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
fold
his
arm
again
,
"
Old
Orlick

going
to
tell
you
somethink

<EOS>
It
be
you
as
do
for
your
shrew
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
again
my
mind
,
with
its
former
inconceivable
rapidity
,
have
exhaust
the
whole
subject
of
the
attack
upon
my
sister
,
her
illness
,
and
her
death
,
before
his
slow
and
hesitate
speech
have
form
these
word

<EOS>
"
It
be
you

villain
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"

your
doing---

I
tell
you

through
you

he
retort
,
catch
up
the
gun
,
and
make
a
blow
with
the
stock
at
the
vacant
air
between
us

"
I
come
upon
her
from
behind

I
come
upon
you
to

night

it
her

leave
her
for
dead

if
there
have
be
a
limekiln
as
nigh
her
as
there
be
now
nigh
you

she
should
not
have
come

life
again

it
warn't

as
do
it

be
favour

Old
Orlick
bully
and
beat
,
eh
?
<EOS>
now
you
pay
for
it

<EOS>
You
do
it
;
now
you
pay
for
it

"
  
<EOS>
He
drink
again
,
and
become
more
ferocious
.
<EOS>
I
see
by
his
tilting
of
the
bottle
that
there
be
no
great
quantity
leave
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
distinctly
understand
that
he
be
work
himself
up
with
its
content
,
to
make
an
end
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
every
drop
it
hold
,
be
a
drop
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
when
I
be
change
into
a
part
of
the
vapour
that
have
creep
towards
me
but
a
little
while
before
,
like
my
own
warning
ghost
he
would
do
as
he
have
do
in
my
sister
's
case
---
make
all
haste
to
the
town
,
and
be
see
slouch
about
there
,
drink
at
the
ale
-
house
.
<EOS>
My
rapid
mind
pursue
him
to
the
town
,
make
a
picture
of
the
street
with
him
in
it
,
and
contrast
its
light
and
life
with
the
lonely
marsh
and
the
white
vapour
creep
over
it
,
into
which
I
should
have
dissolve
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
that
I
could
have
sum
up
year
and
year
and
year
while
he
say
a
dozen
word
,
but
that
what
he
do
say
present
picture
to
me
,
and
not
mere
word
.
<EOS>
in
the
excited
and
exalted
state
of
my
brain
,
I
could
not
think
of
a
place
without
see
it
,
or
of
person
without
see
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
over
-
state
the
vividness
of
these
image
,
and
yet
I
be
so
intent
,
all
the
time
,
upon
him
himself
---
<EOS>
who
would
not
be
intent
on
the
tiger
crouch
to
spring
!
<EOS>
---
that
I
know
of
the
slight
action
of
his
finger
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
drunk
this
second
time
,
he
rise
from
the
bench
on
which
he
sit
,
and
push
the
table
aside
.
<EOS>
then
,
he
take
up
the
candle
,
and
shade
it
with
his
murderous
hand
so
as
to
throw
its
light
on
me
,
stand
before
me
,
look
at
me
and
enjoy
the
sight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wolf
,
I
will
tell
you
something
more

Orlick

you
tumble
over

stair
that
night

I
see
the
staircase
with
its
extinguished
lamp

I
see
the
shadow
of
the
heavy
stair

rail
,
throw
by
the
watchman
's
lantern
on
the
wall

I
see
the
room
that
I
be
never
to
see
again

here

a
door
half
open

there

a
door
close

all
the

furniture
around

and
why
be
Old
Orlick
there

something
more

You

pretty
well
hunt
me
out
of
this
country

so
far
as
get
a

He
flare
the
candle
at

again
,
smoke
my
face

hair
,
and
for
an
instant
blind
me
,
and
turn
his
powerful
back
as
he
replace
the
light
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
a
prayer
,
and
have
be
with
Joe
and
Biddy
and
Herbert
,
before
he
turn
towards
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
clear
space
of
a
few
foot
between
the
table
and
the
opposite
wall
.
<EOS>
within
this
space
,
he
now
slouch
backwards
and
forwards
.
<EOS>
His
great
strength
seem
to
sit
strong
upon
him
than
ever
before
,
as
he
do
this
with
his
hand
hang
loose
and
heavy
at
his
side
,
and
with
his
eye
scowl
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
grain
of
hope
leave
.
<EOS>
wild
as
my
inward
hurry
be
,
and
wonderful
the
force
of
the
picture
that
rush
by
me
instead
of
thought
,
I
could
yet
clearly
understand
that
unless
he
have
resolve
that
I
be
within
a
few
moment
of
surely
perish
out
of
all
human
knowledge
,
he
would
never
have
tell
me
what
he
have
tell
.
  
<EOS>
of
a
sudden
,
he
stop
,
take
the
cork
out
of
his
bottle
,
and
toss
it
away
.
<EOS>
light
as
it
be
,
I
hear
it
fall
like
a
plummet
.
<EOS>
He
swallow
slowly
,
tilt
up
the
bottle
by
little
and
little
,
and
now
he
look
at
me
no
more
.
<EOS>
the
last
few
drop
of
liquor
he
pour
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
and
lick
up
.
<EOS>
then
,
with
a
sudden
hurry
of
violence
and
swear
horribly
,
he
throw
the
bottle
from
him
,
and
stoop
;
and
I
see
in
his
hand
a
stone
-
hammer
with
a
long
heavy
handle
.
  
<EOS>
the
resolution
I
have
make
do
not
desert
me
,
for
,
without
utter
one
vain
word
of
appeal
to
him
,
I
shout
out
with
all
my
might
,
and
struggle
with
all
my
might
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
my
head
and
my
leg
that
I
could
move
,
but
to
that
extent
I
struggle
with
all
the
force
,
until
then
unknown
,
that
be
within
me
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
instant
I
hear
responsive
shout
,
see
figure
and
a
gleam
of
light
dash
in
at
the
door
,
hear
voice
and
tumult
,
and
see
Orlick
emerge
from
a
struggle
of
man
,
as
if
it
be
tumble
water
,
clear
the
table
at
a
leap
,
and
fly
out
into
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
blank
,
I
find
that
I
be
lie
unbound
,
on
the
floor
,
in
the
same
place
,
with
my
head
on
some
one
's
knee
.
<EOS>
My
eye
be
fix
on
the
ladder
against
the
wall
,
when
I
come
to
myself
---
have
open
on
it
before
my
mind
see
it
---
and
thus
as
I
recover
consciousness
,
I
know
that
I
be
in
the
place
where
I
have
lose
it
.
  
<EOS>
too
indifferent
at
first
,
even
to
look
round
and
ascertain
who
support
me
,
I
be
lie
look
at
the
ladder
,
when
there
come
between
me
and
it
,
a
face
.
<EOS>
the
face
of
Trabb
's
boy
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
be
all
right

"
say
Trabb
's
boy
,
in
a
sober
voice
;
"
but
be
not
he
just
pale
though
!
"
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
,
the
face
of
him
who
support
me
look
over
into
mine
,
and
I
see
my
supporter
to
be
---

<EOS>
and
our
old
comrade

I
cry
,
as
he

bent
over
me

<EOS>
"
remember
what

us
in

say
Herbert
,
"
and
be
calm
.

"
  
<EOS>
the
allusion
make
me
spring
up
;
though
I
drop
again
from
the
pain
in
my
arm
.
<EOS>
"
the
time
have
not
go
by
,
Herbert
,
have
it
?

what
night
be
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
how
long
have
I
be
here
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
,
I
have
a
strange
and
strong
misgiving
that
I
have
be
lie
there
a
long
time
---
a
day
and
a
night
---
two
day
and
night
---
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
time
have
not
go
by

It
be
still
Monday
night

<EOS>
"
thank
God

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
all
to
-
morrow
,
Tuesday
,
to
rest
in
,
"
say
Herbert
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
can
not
help
groaning
,
my
dear
Handel
.
<EOS>
what
hurt
have
you
get
?
<EOS>
Can
you
stand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
can
walk
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
hurt
but
in
this
throbbing
arm
.
  
<EOS>
They
lay
it
bare
,
and
do
what
they
could
.
<EOS>
It
be
violently
swell
and
inflame
,
and
I
could
scarcely
endure
to
have
it
touch
.
<EOS>
but
,
they
tear
up
their
handkerchief
to
make
fresh
bandage
,
and
carefully
replace
it
in
the
sling
,
until
we
could
get
to
the
town
and
obtain
some
cool
lotion
to
put
upon
it
.
<EOS>
in
a
little
while
we
have
shut
the
door
of
the
dark
and
empty
sluice
-
house
,
and
be
pass
through
the
quarry
on
our
way
back
.
<EOS>
Trabb
's
boy
---
Trabb
's
overgrow
young
man
now
---
go
before
us
with
a
lantern
,
which
be
the
light
I
have
see
come
in
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
moon
be
a
good
two
hour
high
than
when
I
have
last
see
the
sky
,
and
the
night
though
rainy
be
much
light
.
<EOS>
the
white
vapour
of
the
kiln
be
pass
from
us
as
we
go
by
,
and
,
as
I
have
think
a
prayer
before
,
I
think
a
thanksgiving
now
.
  
<EOS>
Entreating
Herbert
to
tell
me
how
he
have
come
to
my
rescue
---
which
at
first
he
have
flatly
refuse
to
do
,
but
have
insist
on
my
remain
quiet
<EOS>
---
I
learn
that
I
have
<EOS>
in
my
hurry
drop
the
letter
,
open
,
in
our
chamber
,
where
he
,
come
home
to
bring
with
him
Startop
<EOS>
whom
he
have
meet
in
the
street
on
his
way
to
me
,
find
it
,
very
soon
after
I
be
go
.
<EOS>
Its
tone
make
him
uneasy
,
and
the
more
so
because
of
the
inconsistency
between
it
and
the
hasty
letter
I
have
leave
for
him
.
<EOS>
His
uneasiness
increase
instead
of
subside
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
consideration
,
he
set
off
for
the
coach
-
office
,
with
Startop
,
who
volunteer
his
company
,
to
make
inquiry
when
the
next
coach
go
down
.
<EOS>
find
that
the
afternoon
coach
be
go
,
and
find
that
his
uneasiness
grow
into
positive
alarm
,
as
obstacle
come
in
his
way
,
he
resolve
to
follow
in
a
post
-
chaise
.
<EOS>
so
,
he
and
Startop
arrive
at
the
Blue
Boar
,
fully
expect
there
to
find
me
,
or
tiding
of
me
;
but
,
find
neither
,
go
on
to
Miss
Havisham
's
,
where
they
lose
me
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
they
go
back
to
the
hotel
(
doubtless
at
about
the
time
when
I
be
hear
the
popular
local
version
of
my
own
story
)
,
to
refresh
themselves
and
to
get
some
one
to
guide
them
out
upon
the
marsh
.
<EOS>
among
the
lounger
under
the
Boar
's
archway
,
happen
to
be
Trabb
's
boy
---
true
to
his
ancient
habit
of
happen
to
be
everywhere
where
he
have
no
business
---
and
Trabb
's
boy
have
see
me
pass
from
Miss
Havisham
's
in
the
direction
of
my
dining
-
place
.
<EOS>
thus
,
Trabb
's
boy
become
their
guide
,
and
with
him
they
go
out
to
the
sluice
-
house
:
though
by
the
town
way
to
the
marsh
,
which
I
have
avoid
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
they
go
along
,
Herbert
reflect
,
that
I
may
,
after
all
,
have
be
bring
there
on
some
genuine
and
serviceable
errand
tend
to
Provis
's
safety
,
and
,
bethink
himself
that
in
that
case
interruption
must
be
mischievous
,
leave
his
guide
and
startop
on
the
edge
of
the
quarry
,
and
go
on
by
himself
,
and
steal
round
the
house
two
or
three
time
,
endeavour
to
ascertain
whether
all
be
right
within
.
<EOS>
as
he
could
hear
nothing
but
indistinct
sound
of
one
deep
rough
voice
(
this
be
while
my
mind
be
so
busy
)
<EOS>
,
he
even
at
last
begin
to
doubt
whether
I
be
there
,
when
suddenly
I
cry
out
loudly
,
and
he
answer
the
cry
,
and
rush
in
,
closely
follow
by
the
other
two
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
tell
Herbert
what
have
pass
within
the
house
,
he
be
for
our
immediately
go
before
a
magistrate
in
the
town
,
late
at
night
as
it
be
,
and
get
out
a
warrant
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
have
already
consider
that
such
a
course
,
by
detain
us
there
,
or
bind
us
to
come
back
,
may
be
fatal
to
Provis
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
gainsay
this
difficulty
,
and
we
relinquish
all
thought
of
pursue
Orlick
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
for
the
present
,
under
the
circumstance
,
we
deem
it
prudent
to
make
rather
light
of
the
matter
to
Trabb
's
boy
;
who
I
be
convinced
would
have
be
much
affect
by
disappointment
,
if
he
have
know
that
his
intervention
save
me
from
the
limekiln
.
<EOS>
not
that
Trabb
's
boy
be
of
a
malignant
nature
,
but
that
he
have
too
much
spare
vivacity
,
and
that
it
be
in
his
constitution
to
want
variety
and
excitement
at
anybody
's
expense
.
<EOS>
when
we
part
,
I
present
him
with
two
guinea
(
which
seem
to
meet
his
view
)
,
and
tell
him
that
I
be
sorry
ever
to
have
have
an
ill
opinion
of
him
(
which
make
no
impression
on
him
at
all
)
.
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
be
so
close
upon
us
,
we
determine
to
go
back
to
London
that
night
,
three
in
the
post
-
chaise
;
the
rather
,
as
we
should
then
be
clear
away
,
before
the
night
's
adventure
begin
to
be
talk
of
.
<EOS>
Herbert
get
a
large
bottle
of
stuff
for
my
arm
,
and
by
dint
of
have
this
stuff
drop
over
it
all
the
night
through
,
I
be
just
able
to
bear
its
pain
on
the
journey
.
<EOS>
It
be
daylight
when
we
reach
the
Temple
,
and
I
go
at
once
to
bed
,
and
lie
in
bed
all
day
.
  
<EOS>
My
terror
,
as
I
lie
there
,
of
fall
ill
and
be
unfitted
for
to
-
morrow
,
be
so
beset
,
that
I
wonder
it
do
not
disable
me
of
itself
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
do
so
,
pretty
surely
,
in
conjunction
with
the
mental
wear
and
tear
<EOS>
I
have
suffer
,
but
for
the
unnatural
strain
upon
me
that
to
-
morrow
be
.
<EOS>
so
anxiously
look
forward
to
,
charge
with
such
consequence
,
<EOS>
its
result
so
impenetrably
hidden
though
so
near
.
  
<EOS>
no
precaution
could
have
be
more
obvious
than
our
refrain
from
communication
with
him
that
day
;
yet
this
again
increase
my
restlessness
.
<EOS>
I
start
at
every
footstep
and
every
sound
,
believe
that
he
be
discover
and
take
,
and
this
be
the
messenger
to
tell
me
so
.
<EOS>
I
persuade
myself
that
I
know
he
be
take
;
that
there
be
something
more
upon
my
mind
than
a
fear
or
a
presentiment
;
that
the
fact
have
occur
,
and
I
have
a
mysterious
knowledge
of
it
.
<EOS>
as
the
day
wear
on
and
no
ill
news
come
,
as
the
day
close
in
and
darkness
fall
,
my
overshadowing
dread
of
be
disable
by
illness
before
to
-
morrow
morning
,
altogether
master
me
.
<EOS>
My
burn
arm
throb
,
and
my
burn
head
throb
,
and
I
fancy
I
be
begin
to
wander
.
<EOS>
I
count
up
to
high
number
,
to
make
sure
of
myself
,
and
repeat
passage
that
I
know
in
prose
and
verse
.
<EOS>
It
happen
sometimes
that
in
the
mere
escape
of
a
fatigue
mind
,
I
doze
for
some
moment
or
forget
;
then
I
would
say
to
myself
with
a
start
,
"
now
it
have
come
,
and
I
be
turn
delirious
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
keep
me
very
quiet
all
day
,
and
keep
my
arm
constantly
dress
and
give
me
cool
drink
.
<EOS>
whenever
I
fall
asleep
,
I
awake
with
the
notion
I
have
have
in
the
sluice
-
house
,
that
a
long
time
have
elapse
and
the
opportunity
to
save
him
be
go
.
<EOS>
about
midnight
I
get
out
of
bed
and
go
to
Herbert
,
with
the
conviction
that
I
have
be
asleep
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
,
and
that
Wednesday
be
past
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
last
self
-
exhaust
effort
of
my
fretfulness
,
for
,
after
that
,
I
sleep
soundly
.
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
morning
be
dawn
when
I
look
out
of
window
.
<EOS>
the
wink
light
upon
the
bridge
be
already
pale
,
the
come
sun
be
like
a
marsh
of
fire
on
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
the
river
,
still
dark
and
mysterious
,
be
span
by
bridge
that
be
turn
coldly
grey
,
with
here
and
there
at
top
a
warm
touch
from
the
burning
in
the
sky
.
<EOS>
as
I
look
along
the
cluster
roof
,
with
church
tower
and
spire
shoot
into
the
unusually
clear
air
,
the
sun
rise
up
,
and
a
veil
seem
to
be
draw
from
the
river
,
and
million
of
sparkle
burst
out
upon
its
water
.
<EOS>
from
me
too
,
a
veil
seem
to
be
draw
,
and
I
feel
strong
and
well
.
  
<EOS>
Herbert
lie
asleep
in
his
bed
,
and
our
old
fellow
-
student
lie
asleep
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
dress
myself
without
help
,
but
I
make
up
the
fire
,
which
be
still
burn
,
and
get
some
coffee
ready
for
them
.
<EOS>
in
good
time
they
too
start
up
strong
and
well
,
and
we
admit
the
sharp
morning
air
at
the
window
,
and
look
at
the
tide
that
be
still
flow
towards
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
it
turn
at
nine
o'clock
,
"
say
<EOS>
Herbert
,
cheerfully
,
"
look
out
for

Chapter
54
 
it
be
one
of
those
March
day
when
the
sun
shine
hot
and
the
wind
blow
cold
:
when
it
be
summer
in
the
light
,
and
winter
in
the
shade
.
<EOS>
We
have
our
pea
-
coat
with
us
,
and
I
take
a
bag
.
<EOS>
of
all
my
worldly
possession
I
take
no
more
than
the
few
necessary
that
fill
the
bag
.
<EOS>
where
I
may
go
,
what
I
may
do
,
or
when
I
may
return
,
be
question
utterly
unknown
to
me
;
nor
do
I
vex
my
mind
with
them
,
for
it
be
wholly
set
on
Provis
's
safety
.
<EOS>
I
only
wonder
for
the
passing
moment
,
as
I
stop
at
the
door
and
look
back
,
under
what
alter
circumstance
I
should
next
see
those
room
,
if
ever
.
  
<EOS>
We
loiter
down
to
the
Temple
stair
,
and
stand
loiter
there
,
as
if
we
be
not
quite
decide
to
go
upon
the
water
at
all
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
have
take
care
that
the
boat
should
be
ready
and
everything
in
order
.
<EOS>
after
a
little
show
of
indecision
,
which
there
be
none
to
see
but
the
two
or
three
amphibious
creature
belong
to
our
Temple
stair
,
we
go
on
board
and
cast
off
;
Herbert
in
the
bow
,
<EOS>
I
steer
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
about
high
-
water
---
half
-
past
eight
.
  
<EOS>
Our
plan
be
this
.
<EOS>
the
tide
,
begin
to
run
down
at
nine
and
be
with
us
until
three
,
we
intend
still
to
creep
on
after
it
have
turn
,
and
row
against
it
until
dark
.
<EOS>
We
should
then
be
well
in
those
long
reach
below
Gravesend
,
between
Kent
and
Essex
,
where
the
river
be
broad
and
solitary
,
where
the
waterside
inhabitant
be
very
few
,
and
where
lone
public
-
house
be
scatter
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
of
which
we
could
choose
one
for
a
resting
-
place
.
<EOS>
there
we
mean
to
lie
by
,
all
night
.
<EOS>
the
steamer
for
Hamburg
,
and
the
steamer
for
Rotterdam
,
would
start
from
London
at
about
nine
on
Thursday
morning
.
<EOS>
We
should
know
at
what
time
to
expect
them
,
accord
to
where
we
be
,
and
would
hail
the
first
;
so
that
if
by
any
accident
we
be
not
take
aboard
,
we
should
have
another
chance
.
<EOS>
We
know
the
distinguish
mark
of
each
vessel
.
  
<EOS>
the
relief
of
be
at
last
engage
in
the
execution
of
the
purpose
,
be
so
great
to
me
that
I
feel
it
difficult
to
realize
the
condition
in
which
I
have
be
a
few
hour
before
.
<EOS>
the
crisp
air
,
the
sunlight
,
the
movement
on
the
river
,
and
the
move
river
itself
---
the
road
that
run
with
us
,
seem
to
sympathize
with
us
,
animate
us
,
and
encourage
us
on
---
freshen
me
with
new
hope
.
<EOS>
I
feel
mortify
to
be
of
so
little
use
in
the
boat
;
but
,
there
be
few
well
oarsman
than
my
two
friend
,
and
they
row
with
a
steady
stroke
that
be
to
last
all
day
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
time
,
the
steam
-
traffic
on
the
Thames
be
far
below
its
present
extent
,
and
waterman
's
boat
be
far
more
numerous
.
<EOS>
of
barge
,
sail
collier
,
and
coast
trader
,
there
be
perhaps
as
many
as
now
;
but
,
of
steam

ship
,
great
and
small
,
not
a
tithe
or
a
twentieth
part
so
many
.
<EOS>
early
as
it
be
,
there
be
plenty
of
sculler
go
here
and
there
that
morning
,
and
plenty
of
barge
drop
down
with
the
tide
;
the
navigation
of
the
river
between
bridge
,
in
an
open
boat
,
be
a
much
easy
and
commoner
matter
in
those
day
than
it
be
in
these
;
and
we
go
ahead
among
many
skiff
and
wherry
,
briskly
.
  
<EOS>
Old

<EOS>

sit

<EOS>
We
touch
the

lightly
for
a
single

,
and
he
be
on

and
we
be
off
again
.
<EOS>
He
have
a

cloak
with
him
,
and
a

and
he
look

have
wish

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
at
the
Stairs
where
we
have
take

aboard

and
ever
since
,
I
have
look
warily
for
any
token

<EOS>
I
have
see
none

<EOS>
We
certainly
have
not

at

certainly
we

either
attend

follow

<EOS>
if
we
have
be
wait
on

I
should
have
run
in

shore

and
have
oblige
her
to
go
on

or
to
make
her
purpose
evident
.
<EOS>
but
,
we
hold
our
own
,
without
any
appearance
of
molestation
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
his
boat
-
cloak
on
him
,
and
look
,
as
I
have
say
,
a
natural
part
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
(
but
perhaps
the
wretched
life
he
have
lead
,
account
for
it
)
,
that
he
be
the
least
anxious
of
any
of
us
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
indifferent
,
for
he
tell
me
that
he
hope
to
live
to
see
his
gentleman
one
of
the
good
of
gentleman
in
a
foreign
country
;
he
be
not
dispose
to
be
passive
or
resign
,
as
I
understand
it
;
but
he
have
no
notion
of
meeting
danger
half
way
.
<EOS>
when
it
come
upon
him
,
he
confront
it
,
but
it
must
come
before
he
trouble
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
know
,
dear
boy

"
he
say
to
me
,
"
what
it
be
to
sit

along
my

have
my

you

you
do

"
I
think
I

I
answer

<EOS>
"
ah

"
say
he
,
shake
his

gravely

<EOS>

but
you
do

<EOS>
You
must
have
be
under

dear

to
know
it
equal

but
I
be
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
occur
to
me
as
inconsistent
,
that
for
any
master
idea
,
he
should
have
endanger
his
freedom
and
even
his
life
.
<EOS>
but
I
reflect
that
perhaps
freedom
without
danger
be
too
much
apart
from
all
the
habit
of
his
existence
to
be
to
him
what
it
would
be
to
another
man
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
far
out
,
since
he
say
,
after
smoke
a
little
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
dear
boy

when
I
be
over
yonder

t'other

I
be
always
a

this

it
come
flat

for

I
be
a

rich

<EOS>
everybody
know
Magwitch

and
Magwitch
could
come

and
Magwitch
could
go

and
nobody

would
be
trouble
about
him
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
so
easy
concern
me
here
,
dear

would
not
be

leastwise
,
if
they

where
I

if
all
go

I

"
you
will

"
  
<EOS>
"
well

he
return
,
draw
a
long
breath
,
"
I
hope
so

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

and
think
so

"
  
<EOS>
He
dip
his
hand
in
the
water
over
the
boat
's
gunwale
,
and
say
,
smile
with
that
soften
air
upon
him
which
be
not
new
to
me
:
  
<EOS>
"

smoke
just
then
,
that
we
can
no
more
see
to
the
bottom
of
the
next
few
hour
,
than
we
can
see
to
the
bottom
of
this
river
what
I
catch
hold
of
.
<EOS>
nor
yet
we
can
not
no
more
hold
their
tide
than
I
can
hold
this
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
run
through
my
finger
and
go
<EOS>
,
you
see
!
<EOS>
"
hold
up
his
dripping
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
for
your
face
,
I
should
think
you
be
a
little
despondent
,
"
say
I.
  
"
not
a
bit
on
it
,
dear
boy
!
<EOS>
It
come
of
flow
on
so
quiet
,
and
of
that
there
ripple
at
the
boat
's
head
make
a
sort
of
a
Sunday
tune
.
<EOS>
maybe
I
be
a
grow
a
trifle
old
besides
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
pipe
back
in
his
mouth
with
an
undisturbed
expression
of
face
,
and
sit
as
compose
and
content
as
if
we
be
already
out
of
England
.
<EOS>
yet
he
be
as
submissive
to
a
word
of
advice
as
if
he
have
be
in
constant
terror
,
for
,
when
we
run
ashore
to
get
some
bottle
of
beer
into
the
boat
,
and
he
be
step
out
<EOS>
,
I
hint
that
I
think
he
would
be
safe
where
he
be
,
and
he
say
,
"
do
you
,
dear
boy
?
"
<EOS>
and
quietly
sit
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
air
feel
cold
upon
the
river
,
but
it
be
a
bright
day
,
and
the
sunshine
be
very
cheering
.
<EOS>
the
tide
run
strong
,
I
take
care
to
lose
none
of
it
,
and
our
steady
stroke
carry
us
on
thoroughly
well
.
<EOS>
by
imperceptible
degree
,
as
the
tide
run
out
,
we
lose
more
and
more
of
the
nearer
wood
and
hill
,
and
drop
low
and
low
between
the
muddy
bank
,
but
the
tide
be
yet
with
us
when
we
be
off
Gravesend
.
<EOS>
as
our
charge
be
wrap
in
his
cloak
,
I
purposely
pass
within
a
boat
or
two
's
length
of
the
float
Custom
House
,
and
so
out
to
catch
the
stream
,
alongside
of
two
emigrant
ship
,
and
under
the
bow
of
a
large
transport
with
troop
on
the
forecastle
look
down
at
us
.
<EOS>
and
soon
the
tide
begin
to
slacken
,
and
the
craft
lie
at
anchor
to
swing
,
and
presently
they
have
all
swing
round
,
and
the
ship
that
be
take
advantage
of
the
new
tide
to
get
up
to
the
Pool
,
begin
to
crowd
upon
us
in
a
fleet
,
and
we
keep
under
the
shore
,
as
much
out
of
the
strength
of
the
tide
now
as
we
could
,
stand
carefully
off
from
low
shallow
and
mud
-
bank
.
  
<EOS>
Our
oarsman
be
so
fresh
,
by
dint
of
have
occasionally
let
her
drive
with
the
tide
for
a
minute
or
two
,
that
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
rest
prove
full
as
much
as
they
want
.
<EOS>
We
get
ashore
among
some
slippery
stone
while
we
eat
and
drank
what
we
have
with
us
,
and
look
about
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
my
own
marsh
country
,
flat
and
monotonous
,
and
with
a
dim
horizon
;
while
the
wind
river
turn
and
turn
,
and
the
great
float
buoy
upon
it
turn
and
turn
,
and
everything
else
seem
strand
and
still
.
<EOS>
for
,
now
,
the
last
of
the
fleet
of
ship
be
round
the
last
low
point
we
have
head
;
and
the
last
green
barge
,
straw
-
laden
,
with
a
brown
sail
,
have
follow
;
and
some
ballast
-
lighter
,
shape
like
a
child
's
first
rude
imitation
of
a
boat
,
lie
low
in
the
mud
;
and
a
little
squat
shoal
-
lighthouse
on
open
pile
,
stand
crippled
in
the
mud
on
stilt
and
crutch
;
and
slimy
stake
stick
out
of
the
mud
,
and
slimy
stone
stick
out
of
the
mud
,
and
red
landmark
and
tidemark
stick
out
of
the
mud
,
and
an
old
landing
-
stage
and
an
old
roofless
building
slip
into
the
mud
,
and
all
about
us
be
stagnation
and
mud
.
  
<EOS>
We
push
off
again
,
and
make
what
way
we
could
.
<EOS>
It
be
much
hard
work
now
,
but
Herbert
and
Startop
persevere
,
and
row
,
and
row
,
and
row
,
until
the
sun
go
down
.
<EOS>
by
that
time
the
river
have
lift
us
a
little
,
so
that
we
could
see
above
the
bank
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
red
sun
,
on
the
low
level
of
the
shore
,
in
a
purple
haze
,
fast
deepen
into
black
;
and
there
be
the
solitary
flat
marsh
;
and
far
away
there
be
the
rise
ground
,
between
which
and
us
there
seem
to
be
no
life
,
save
here
and
there
in
the
foreground
a
melancholy
gull
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
night
be
fast
fall
,
and
as
the
moon
,
be
past
the
full
,
would
not
rise
early
,
we
hold
a
little
council
:
a
short
one
,
for
clearly
our
course
be
to
lie
by
at
the
first
lonely
tavern
we
could
find
.
<EOS>
so
,
they
ply
their
oar
once
more
,
and
I
look
out
for
anything
like
a
house
.
<EOS>
thus
we
hold
on
,
speak
little
,
for
four
or
five
dull
mile
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
cold
,
and
,
a
collier
come
by
us
,
with
her
galley
-
fire
smoking
and
flaring
,
look
like
a
comfortable
home
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
as
dark
by
this
time
as
it
would
be
until
morning
;
and
what
light
we
have
,
seem
to
come
more
from
the
river
than
the
sky
,
as
the
oar
in
their
dipping
strike
at
a
few
reflect
star
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
dismal
time
we
be
evidently
all
possess
by
the
idea
that
we
be
follow
.
<EOS>
as
the
tide
make
,
it
flap
heavily
at
irregular
interval
against
the
shore
;
and
whenever
such
a
sound
come
,
one
or
other
of
us
be
sure
to
start
and
look
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
here
and
there
,
the
set
of
the
current
have
wear
down
the
bank
into
a
little
creek
,
and
we
be
all
suspicious
of
such
place
,
and
eye
them
nervously
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
"
what
be
that
ripple
?
"
<EOS>
one
of
us
would
say
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
or
another
,
"
be
that
a
boat
yonder
?
"
<EOS>
and
afterwards
,
we
would
fall
into
a
dead
silence
,
and
I
would
sit
impatiently
think
with
what
an
unusual
amount
of
noise
the
oar
work
in
the
thowel
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
we
descry
a
light
and
a
roof
,
and
presently
afterwards
run
alongside
a
little
causeway
make
of
stone
that
have
be
pick
up
hard
by
.
<EOS>
leave
the
rest
in
the
boat
,
I
step
ashore
,
and
find
the
light
to
be
in
a
window
of
a
public
-
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dirty
place
enough
,
and
I
dare
say
not
unknown
to
smuggling
adventurer
;
but
there
be
a
good
fire
in
the
kitchen
,
and
there
be
egg
and
bacon
to
eat
,
and
various
liquor
to
drink
.
<EOS>
also
,
there
be
two
double
-
bed
room
---
"
such
as
they
be
,
"
the
landlord
say
.
<EOS>
no
other
company
be
in
the
house
than
the
landlord
,
his
wife
,
and
a
grizzle
male
creature
,
the
"
Jack
"
of
the
little
causeway
,
who
be
as
slimy
and
smeary
as
if
he
have
be
low
-
water
mark
too
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
assistant
,
I
go
down
to
the
boat
again
,
and
we
all
come
ashore
,
and
bring
out
the
oar
,
and
rudder
,
and
boat
-
hook
,
and
all
else
,
and
haul
her
up
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
We
make
a
very
good
meal
by
the
kitchen
fire
,
and
then
apportion
the
bedroom
:
<EOS>
Herbert
and
Startop
be
to
occupy
one
;
I
and
our
charge
the
other
.
<EOS>
We
find
the
air
as
carefully
exclude
from
both
,
as
if
air
be
fatal
to
life
;
and
there
be
more
dirty
clothe
and
bandbox
under
the
bed
than
I
should
have
think
the
family
possess
.
<EOS>
but
,
we
consider
ourselves
well
off
,
notwithstanding
,
for
a
more
solitary
place
we
could
not
have
find
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
comfort
ourselves
by
the
fire
after
our
meal
,
the
Jack
---
who
be
sit
in
a
corner
,
and
who
have
a
bloated
pair
of
shoe
on
,
which
he
have
exhibit
while
we
be
eat
our
egg
and
bacon
,
as
interesting
relic
that
he
have
take
a
few
day
ago
from
the
foot
of
a
drowned
seaman
wash
ashore
---
ask
me
if
we
have
see
a
four
-
oare
galley
go
up
with
the
tide
?
<EOS>
when
I
tell
him
no
,
he
say
she
must
have
go
down
then
,
and
yet
she
"
take
up
too
,
"
when
she
leave
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
must
ha
'
think
better
on't
for
some
reason
or
another
,
"
say
the
Jack
,
"
and
go
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
four

oare
galley
,
do
you
say
?
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
a
four

"
say
the
Jack
,
"
and
two
sitter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
they
come
ashore
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
put
in
with
a
stone
two
-
gallon
jar
,
for
some
beer
.
<EOS>
I
would
ha
'
be
glad
to
pison
the
beer
myself
,
"
say
the
Jack
,
"
or
put
some
rattle
physic
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
why
,
"
say
the
Jack
.
<EOS>
He
speak
in
a
slushy
voice
,
as
if
much
mud
have
wash
into
his
throat
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
think
,
"
say
the
landlord
:
a
weakly
meditative
man
with
a
pale
eye
,
who
seem
to
rely
greatly
on
his
Jack
:
"
<EOS>
he
think
they
be
,
what
they
be
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
I
think
,
"
observe
the
Jack
.
  
<EOS>
"
\
<EOS>
You
\
 
think
Custum

Us

"
say
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
say
the
Jack
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
wrong
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
AMI
!
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
infinite
meaning
of
his
reply
and
his
boundless
confidence
in
his
view
,
the
Jack
take
one
of
his
bloated
shoe
off
,
look
into
it
,
knock
a
few
stone
out
of
it
on
the
kitchen
floor
,
and
put
it
on
again
.
<EOS>
He
do
this
with
the
air
of
a
Jack
who
be
so
right
that
he
could
afford
to
do
anything
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
do
you
make
out
that
they
do
with
their
button
then
,
Jack
?
"
ask
the
landlord
,
vacillate
weakly
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
with
their
button
?
"
return
the
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
chuck
'em
overboard

swallere
'em

'em

to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
cheeky
,
Jack
,
"
remonstrate
the
landlord
,
in
a
melancholy
and
pathetic
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
Custum

Us
officer
know
what
to
do
with

button
,
"
say
the
Jack
,
repeat
the
obnoxious
word
with
the
great
contempt
,
"
when
they
come
betwixt
him
and
his
own
light
.
<EOS>
a
four
and
two
sitter
do
not
go
hang
and
hover
,
up
with
one
tide
and
down
with
another
,
and
both
with
and
against
another
,
without
there
be
Custum
'
Us
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
say
which
he
go
out
in
disdain
;
and
the
landlord
,
have
no
one
to
rely
upon
,
find
it
impracticable
to
pursue
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
this
dialogue
make
us
all
uneasy
,
and
me
very
uneasy
.
<EOS>
the
dismal
wind
be
mutter
round
the
house
,
the
tide
be
flap
at
the
shore
,
and
I
have
a
feeling
that
we
be
cage
and
threaten
.
<EOS>
a
four
-
oare
galley
hover
about
in
so
unusual
a
way
as
to
attract
this
notice
,
be
an
ugly
circumstance
that
I
could
not
get
rid
of
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
induce
Provis
to
go
up
to
bed
,
I
go
outside
with
my
two
companion
<EOS>
(
startop
by
this
time
know
the
state
of
the
case
)
,
and
hold
another
council
.
<EOS>
whether
we
should
remain
at
the
house
until
near
the
steamer
's
time
,
which
would
be
about
one
in
the
afternoon
;
or
whether
we
should
put
off
early
in
the
morning
;
be
the
question
we
discuss
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
we
deem
it
the
well
course
to
lie
where
we
be
,
until
within
an
hour
or
so
of
the
steamer
's
time
,
and
then
to
get
out
in
her
track
,
and
drift
easily
with
the
tide
.
<EOS>
have
settle
to
do
this
,
we
return
into
the
house
and
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
lie
down
with
the
great
part
of
my
clothe
on
,
and
sleep
well
for
a
few
hour
.
<EOS>
when
I
awoke
,
the
wind
have
rise
,
and
the
sign
of
the
house
(
the
Ship
)
be
creak
and
bang
about
,
with
noise
that
startle
me
.
<EOS>
rise
softly
,
for
my
charge
lie
fast
asleep
,
I
look
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
It
command
the
causeway
where
we
have
haul
up
our
boat
,
and
,
as
my
eye
adapt
themselves
to
the
light
of
the
clouded
moon
,
I
see
two
man
look
into
her
.
<EOS>
They
pass
by
under
the
window
,
look
at
nothing
else
,
and
they
do
not
go
down
to
the
landing
-
place
which
I
could
discern
to
be
empty
,
but
strike
across
the
marsh
in
the
direction
of
the
Nore
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
impulse
be
to
call
up
Herbert
,
and
show
him
the
two
man
go
away
.
<EOS>
but
,
reflect
before
I
get
into
his
room
,
which
be
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
adjoin
mine
,
that
he
and
Startop
have
have
a
hard
day
than
I
,
and
be
fatigue
,
I
forbear
.
<EOS>
go
back
to
my
window
,
I
could
see
the
two
man
move
over
the
marsh
.
<EOS>
in
that
light
,
however
,
I
soon
lose
them
,
and
feel
very
cold
,
lie
down
to
think
of
the
matter
,
and
fall
asleep
again
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
up
early
.
<EOS>
as
we
walk
to
and
fro
,
all
four
together
,
before
breakfast
,
I
deem
it
right
to
recount
what
I
have
see
.
<EOS>
again
our
charge
be
the
least
anxious
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
likely
that
the
man
belong
to
the
Custom
House
,
he
say
quietly
,
and
that
they
have
no
thought
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
persuade
myself
that
it
be
so
---
as
,
indeed
,
it
may
easily
be
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
propose
that
he
and
I
should
walk
away
together
to
a
distant
point
we
could
see
,
and
that
the
boat
should
take
us
aboard
there
,
or
as
near
there
as
may
prove
feasible
,
at
about
noon
.
<EOS>
this
being
consider
a
good
precaution
,
soon
after
breakfast
he
and
I
set
forth
,
without
say
anything
at
the
tavern
.
  
<EOS>
He
smoke
his
pipe
as
we
go
along
,
and
sometimes
stop
to
clap
me
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
one
would
have
suppose
that
it
be
I
who
be
in
danger
,
not
he
,
and
that
he
be
reassure
me
.
<EOS>
We
speak
very
little
.
<EOS>
as
we
approach
the
point
,
I
beg
him
to
remain
in
a
sheltered
place
,
while
I
go
on
to
reconnoitre
;
for
,
it
be
towards
it
that
the
man
have
pass
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
He
comply
,
and
I
go
on
alone
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
boat
off
the
point
,
nor
any
boat
draw
up
anywhere
near
it
,
nor
be
there
any
sign
of
the
man
have
embark
there
.
<EOS>
but
,
to
be
sure
the
tide
be
high
,
and
there
may
have
be
some
footprint
under
water
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
look
out
from
his
shelter
in
the
distance
,
and
see
that
I
wave
my
hat
to
him
to
come
up
,
he
rejoin
me
,
and
there
we
wait
;
sometimes
lie
on
the
bank
wrap
in
our
coat
,
and
sometimes
move
about
to
warm
ourselves
:
until
we
see
our
boat
come
round
.
<EOS>
We
get
aboard
easily
,
and
row
out
into
the
track
of
the
steamer
.
<EOS>
by
that
time
it
want
but
ten
minute
of
one
o'clock
,
and
we
-
begin
to
look
out
for
her
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
it
be
half
-
past
one
before
we
see
her
smoke
,
and
soon
afterwards
we
see
behind
it
the
smoke
of
another
steamer
.
<EOS>
as
they
be
come
on
at
full
speed
,
we
get
the
two
bag
ready
,
and
take
that
opportunity
of
say
good
-
bye
to
Herbert
and
Startop
.
<EOS>
We
have
all
shake
hand
cordially
,
and
neither
Herbert
's
eye
nor
mine
be
quite
dry
,
when
I
see
a
four
-
oare
galley
shoot
out
from
under
the
bank
but
a
little
way
ahead
of
us
,
and
row
out
into
the
same
track
.
  
<EOS>
a
stretch
of
shore
have
be
as
yet
between
us
and
the
steamer
's
smoke
,
by
reason
of
the
bend
and
wind
of
the
river
;
but
now
she
be
visible
,
come
head
on
.
<EOS>
I
call
to
Herbert
and
Startop
to
keep
before
the
tide
,
that
she
may
see
us
lie
by
for
her
,
and
I
adjure
Provis
to
sit
quite
still
,
wrap
in
his
cloak
.
<EOS>
He
answer
cheerily
,
"
trust
to
me
,
dear
boy
,
"
and
sit
like
a
statue
.
<EOS>
meantime
the
galley
,
which
be
very
skilfully
handle
,
have
cross
us
,
let
us
come
up
with
her
,
and
fall
alongside
.
<EOS>
leave
just
room
enough
for
the
play
of
the
oar
,
she
keep
alongside
,
drift
when
we
drift
,
and
pull
a
stroke
or
two
when
we
pull
.
<EOS>
of
the
two
sitter
,
one
hold
the
rudder
line
,
and
look
at
us
attentively
---
as
do
all
the
rower
;
the
other
sitter
be
wrap
up
,
much
as
Provis
be
,
and
seem
to
shrink
,
and
whisper
some
instruction
to
the
steerer
as
he
look
at
us
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
be
speak
in
either
boat
.
  
<EOS>
startop
could
make
out
,
after
a
few
minute
,
which
steamer
be
first
,
and
give
me
the
word
"
Hamburg
,
"
in
a
low
voice
as
we
sit
face
to
face
.
<EOS>
She
be
near
us
very
fast
,
and
the
beating
of
her
paddle
grow
louder
and
louder
.
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
her
shadow
be
absolutely
upon
us
,
when
the
galley
hail
us
.
<EOS>
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
return
Transport
there
,
"
say
the
man
who
hold
the
line
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
man
,
wrap
in
the
cloak
.
<EOS>
His
name
be
Abel
Magwitch
,
otherwise
Provis
.
<EOS>
I
apprehend
that
man
,
and
call
upon
him
to
surrender
,
and
you
to
assist
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
the
same
moment
,
without
give
any
audible
direction
to
his
crew
,
he
run
the
galley
aboard
of
us
.
<EOS>
They
have
pull
one
sudden
stroke
ahead
,
have
get
their
oar
in
,
have
run
athwart
us
,
and
be
hold
on
to
our
gunwale
,
before
we
know
what
they
be
do
.
<EOS>
this
cause
great
confusion
on
board
the
steamer
,
and
I
hear
them
call
to
us
,
and
hear
the
order
give
to
stop
the
paddle
,
and
hear
them
stop
,
but
feel
her
drive
down
upon
us
irresistibly
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
moment
,
I
see
the
steersman
of
the
galley
lie
his
hand
on
his
prisoner
's
shoulder
,
and
see
that
both
boat
be
swinge
round
with
the
force
of
the
tide
,
and
see
that
all
hand
on
board
the
steamer
be
run
forward
quite
frantically
.
<EOS>
still
in
the
same
moment
I
see
the
prisoner
start
up
,
lean
across
his
captor
,
and
pull
the
cloak
from
the
neck
of
the
shrink
sitter
in
the
galley
.
<EOS>
still
in
the
same
moment
,
I
see
that
the
face
disclose
,
be
the
face
of
the
other
convict
of
long
ago
.
<EOS>
still
in
the
same
moment
,
I
see
the
face
tilt
backward
with
a
white
terror
on
it
that
I
shall
never
forget
,
and
hear
a
great
cry
on
board
the
steamer
and
a
loud
splash
in
the
water
,
and
feel
the
boat
sink
from
under
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
but
for
an
instant
that
I
seem
to
struggle
with
a
thousand
mill
-
weir
and
a
thousand
flash
of
light
;
that
instant
past
,
I
be
take
on
board
the
galley
.
<EOS>
Herbert
be
there
,
and
Startop
be
there
;
but
our
boat
be
go
,
and
the
two
convict
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
what
with
the
cry
aboard
the
steamer
,
and
the
furious
blowing
off
of
her
steam
,
and
her
drive
on
,
and
our
driving
on
,
I
could
not
at
first
distinguish
sky
from
water
or
shore
from
shore
;
but
,
the
crew
of
the
galley
right
her
with
great
speed
,
and
,
pull
certain
swift
strong
stroke
ahead
,
lie
upon
their
oar
,
every
man
look
silently
and
eagerly
at
the
water
astern
.
<EOS>
presently
a
dark
object
be
see
in
it
,
bear
towards
us
on
the
tide
.
<EOS>
no
man
speak
,
but
the
steersman
hold
up
his
hand
,
and
all
softly
back
water
,
and
keep
the
boat
straight
and
true
before
it
.
<EOS>
as
it
come
near
,
I
see
it
to
be
Magwitch
,
swimming
,
but
not
swim
freely
.
<EOS>
He
be
take
on
board
,
and
instantly
manacle
at
the
wrist
and
ankle
.
  
<EOS>
the
galley
be
keep
steady
,
and
the
silent
eager
look
-
out
at
the
water
be
resume
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
Rotterdam
steamer
now
come
up
and
apparently
not
understand
what
have
happen
,
come
on
at
speed
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
she
have
be
hail
and
stop
,
both
steamer
be
drift
away
from
us
,
and
we
be
rise
and
fall
in
a
troubled
wake
of
water
.
<EOS>
the
look
-
out
be
keep
,
long
after
all
be
still
again
and
the
two
steamer
be
go
;
but
,
everybody
know
that
it
be
hopeless
now
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
we
give
it
up
,
and
pull
under
the
shore
towards
the
tavern
we
have
lately
leave
,
where
we
be
receive
with
no
little
surprise
.
<EOS>
here
,
I
be
able
to
get
some
comfort
for
Magwitch
---
<EOS>
provi
no
longer
---
who
have
receive
some
very
severe
injury
in
the
chest
and
a
deep
cut
in
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
he
believe
himself
to
have
go
under
the
keel
of
the
steamer
,
and
to
have
be
strike
on
the
head
in
rise
.
<EOS>
the
injury
to
his
chest
(
which
render
his
breathing
extremely
painful
)
<EOS>
he
think
he
have
receive
against
the
side
of
the
galley
.
<EOS>
He
add
that
he
do
not
pretend
to
say
what
he
may
or
may
not
have
do
to
Compeyson
,
but
,
that
in
the
moment
of
his
lay
his
hand
on
his
cloak
to
identify
him
,
that
villain
have
stagger
up
and
stagger
back
,
and
they
have
both
go
overboard
together
;
when
the
sudden
wrenching
of
him
(
Magwitch
)
out
of
our
boat
,
and
the
endeavour
of
his
captor
to
keep
him
in
it
,
have
capsize
us
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
in
a
whisper
that
they
have
go
down
,
fiercely
lock
in
each
other
's
arm
,
and
that
there
have
be
a
struggle
under
water
,
and
that
he
have
disengage
himself
,
strike
out
,
and
swum
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
have
any
reason
to
doubt
the
exact
truth
of
what
he
thus
tell
me
.
<EOS>
the
officer
who
steer
the
galley
give
the
same
account
of
their
go
overboard
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
ask
this
officer
's
permission
to
change
the
prisoner
's
wet
clothe
by
purchase
any
spare
garment
I
could
get
at
the
public
-
house
,
he
give
it
readily
:
merely
observe
that
he
must
take
charge
of
everything
his
prisoner
have
about
him
.
<EOS>
so
the
pocket
-
book
which
have
once
be
in
my
hand
,
pass
into
the
officer
's
.
<EOS>
He
further
give
me
leave
to
accompany
the
prisoner
to
London
;
but
,
decline
to
accord
that
grace
to
my
two
friend
.
  
<EOS>
the
Jack
at
the
ship
be
instruct
where
the
drown
man
have
go
down
,
and
undertake
to
search
for
the
body
in
the
place
where
it
be
likeliest
to
come
ashore
.
<EOS>
His
interest
in
its
recovery
seem
to
me
to
be
much
heighten
when
he
hear
that
it
have
stocking
on
.
<EOS>
probably
,
it
take
about
a
dozen
drown
man
to
fit
him
out
completely
;
and
that
may
have
be
the
reason
why
the
different
article
of
his
dress
be
in
various
stage
of
decay
.
  
<EOS>
We
remain
at
the
public
-
house
until
the
tide
turn
,
and
then
Magwitch
be
carry
down
to
the
galley
and
put
on
board
.
<EOS>
Herbert
and
Startop
be
to
get
to
London
by
land
,
as
soon
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
doleful
parting
,
and
when
I
take
my
place
by
Magwitch
's
side
,
I
feel
that
that
be
my
place
henceforth
while
he
live
.
  
<EOS>
for
now
,
my
repugnance
to
him
have
all
melt
away
,
and
in
the
hunt
wound
shackle
creature
who
hold
my
hand
in
his
,
I
only
see
a
man
who
have
mean
to
be
my
benefactor
,
and
who
have
feel
affectionately
,
gratefully
,
and
generously
,
towards
me
with
great
constancy
through
a
series
of
year
.
<EOS>
I
only
see
in
him
a
much
well
man
than
I
have
be
to
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
His
breathing
become
more
difficult
and
painful
as
the
night
draw
on
,
and
often
he
could
not
repress
a
groan
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
rest
him
on
the
arm
I
could
use
,
in
any
easy
position
;
but
,
it
be
dreadful
to
think
that
I
could
not
be
sorry
at
heart
for
his
be
badly
hurt
,
since
it
be
unquestionably
good
that
he
should
die
.
<EOS>
that
there
be
,
still
live
,
people
enough
who
be
able
and
willing
to
identify
him
,
I
could
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
that
he
would
be
leniently
treat
,
I
could
not
hope
.
<EOS>
He
who
have
be
present
in
the
bad
light
at
his
trial
,
who
have
since
break
prison
and
have
be
try
again
,
who
have
return
from
transportation
under
a
life
sentence
,
and
who
have
occasion
the
death
of
the
man
who
be
the
cause
of
his
arrest
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
return
towards
the
set
sun
we
have
yesterday
leave
behind
us
,
and
as
the
stream
of
our
hope
seem
all
run
back
,
I
tell
him
how
grieved
I
be
to
think
that
he
have
come
home
for
my
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
boy
,
"
he
answer
,
"
I
be
quite
content
to
take
my
chance
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
my
boy
,
and
he
can
be
a
gentleman
without
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
about
that
,
while
we
have
be
there
side
by
side
.
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
apart
from
any
inclination
of
my
own
,
I
understand
Wemmick
's
hint
now
.
<EOS>
I
foresaw
that
,
be
convict
,
his
possession
would
be
forfeit
to
the
Crown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lookee
here
,
dear
boy
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
good
as
a
gentleman
should
not
be
know
to
belong
to
me
now
.
<EOS>
only
come
to
see
me
as
if
you
come
by
chance
alonger
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
sit
where
I
can
see
you
when
I
be
swear
to
,
for
the
last
o
'
many
time
,
and
I
do
not
ask
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
stir
from
your
side
,
"
say
I
,
"
when
I
be
suffer
to
be
near
you
.
<EOS>
please
God
,
I
will
be
as
true
to
you
,
as
you
have
be
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
feel
his
hand
tremble
as
it
hold
mine
,
and
he
turn
his
face
away
as
he
lie
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
and
I
hear
that
old
sound
in
his
throat
---
soften
now
,
like
all
the
rest
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
thing
that
he
have
touch
this
point
,
for
it
put
into
my
mind
what
I
may
not
otherwise
have
think
of
until
too
late
:
<EOS>
that
he
nee
never
know
how
his
hope
of
enrich
me
have
perish
.
    
<EOS>
chapter

<EOS>
he
be
take
to
the
Police
Court
next
day
,
and
would
have
be
immediately
commit
for
trial
,
but
that
it
be
necessary
to
send
down
for
an
old
officer
of
the
prison
-
ship
from
which
he
have
once
escape
,
to
speak
to
his
identity
.
<EOS>
nobody
doubt
it
;
but
,
Compeyson
,
who
have
mean
to
depose
to
it
,
be
tumble
on
the
tide
,
dead
,
and
it
happen
that
there
be
not
at
that
time
any
prison
officer
in
London
who
could
give
the
require
evidence
.
<EOS>
I
have
go
direct
to
Mr
Jaggers
at
his
private
house
,
on
my
arrival
over
night
,
to
retain
his
assistance
,
and
Mr
Jaggers
on
the
prisoner
's
behalf
would
admit
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
sole
resource
,
for
he
tell
me
that
the
case
must
be
over
in
five
minute
when
the
witness
be
there
,
and
that
no
power
on
earth
could
prevent
its
go
against
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
impart
to
Mr
Jaggers
my
design
of
keep
him
in
ignorance
of
the
fate
of
his
wealth
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jaggers
be
querulous
and
angry
with
me
for
have
"
let
it
slip
through
my
finger
,
"
and
say
we
must
memorialize
by
-
and
-
by
,
and
try
at
all
event
for
some
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
he
do
not
conceal
from
me
that
although
there
may
be
many
case
in
which
the
forfeiture
would
not
be
exact
,
there
be
no
circumstance
in
this
case
to
make
it
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
understand
that
,
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
relate
to
the
outlaw
,
or
connect
with
him
by
any
recognizable
tie
;
he
have
put
his
hand
to
no
writing
or
settlement
in
my
favour
before
his
apprehension
,
and
to
do
so
now
would
be
idle
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
claim
,
and
I
finally
resolve
,
and
ever
afterwards
abide
by
the
resolution
,
that
my
heart
should
never
be
sicken
with
the
hopeless
task
of
attempt
to
establish
one
.
  
<EOS>
there
appear
to
be
reason
for
supposing
that
the
drown
informer
have
hope
for
a
reward
out
of
this
forfeiture
,
and
have
obtain
some
accurate
knowledge
of
Magwitch
's
affair
.
<EOS>
when
his
body
be
find
,
many
mile
from
the
scene
of
his
death
,
and
so
horribly
disfigure
that
he
be
only
recognizable
by
the
content
of
his
pocket
,
note
be
still
legible
,
fold
in
a
case
he
carry
.
<EOS>
among
these
,
be
the
name
of
a
banking
-
house
in
New
South
Wales
where
a
sum
of
money
be
,
and
the
designation
of
certain
land
of
considerable
value
.
<EOS>
both
these
head
of
information
be
in
a
list
that
Magwitch
,
while
in
prison
,
give
to
Mr
Jaggers
,
of
the
possession
he
suppose
I
should
inherit
.
<EOS>
His
ignorance
,
poor
fellow
,
at
last
serve
him
;
he
never
mistrust
but
that
my
inheritance
be
quite
safe
,
with
Mr
Jaggers
's
aid
.
  
<EOS>
after
three
day
'
delay
,
during
which
the
crown
prosecution
stand
over
for
the
production
of
the
witness
from
the
prison
-
ship
,
the
witness
come
,
and
complete
the
easy
case
.
<EOS>
He
be
commit
to
take
his
trial
at
the
next
Sessions
,
which
would
come
on
in
a
month
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
at
this
dark
time
of
my
life
that
Herbert
return
home
one
evening
,
a
good
deal
cast
down
,
and
say
:
  
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Handel
,
I
fear
I
shall
soon
have
to
leave
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
partner
have
prepare
me
for
that
,
I
be
less
surprised
than
he
think
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
lose
a
fine
opportunity
if
I
put
off
go
to
Cairo
,
and
I
be
very
much
afraid
I
must
go
,
Handel
,
when
you
most
need
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Herbert
,
I
shall
always
need
you
,
because
I
shall
always
love
you
;
but
my
need
be
no
great
now
,
than
at
another
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
so
lonely
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
leisure
to
think
of
that
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
I
be
always
with
him
to
the
full
extent
of
the
time
allow
,
and
that
I
should
be
with
him
all
day
long
,
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
come
away
from
him
,
you
know
that
my
thought
be
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
dreadful
condition
to
which
he
be
bring
,
be
so
appalling
to
both
of
us
,
that
we
could
not
refer
to
it
in
plainer
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
"
say
Herbert
,
"
let
the
near
prospect
of
our
separation
---
for
,
it
be
very
near
---
be
my
justification
for
trouble
you
about
yourself
.
<EOS>
have
you
think
of
your
future
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
for
I
have
be
afraid
to
think
of
any
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
yours
can
not
be
dismiss
;
indeed
,
my
dear
dear
Handel
,
it
must
not
be
dismiss
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
enter
on
it
now
,
as
far
as
a
few
friendly
word
go
,
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,

say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
in
this
branch
house
of
ours
,
Handel
,
we
must
have
a

I
see
that
his
delicacy
be
avoid
the
right
word
,
so
I
say
,
"
a
clerk

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
clerk

<EOS>
and
I
hope
it
be
not
at
all
unlikely
that
he
may
expand
(
as
a
clerk
of
your
acquaintance
have
expand
)
into
a
partner
.
<EOS>
now
,
Handel
---
in
short
,
my
dear
boy
,
will
you
come
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
charmingly
cordial
and
engage
in
the
manner
in
which
after
say
"
now
,
Handel
,
"
as
if
it
be
the
grave
beginning
of
a
portentous
business
exordium
,
he
have
suddenly
give
up
that
tone
,
stretch
out
his
honest
hand
,
and
speak
like
a
schoolboy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Clara
and
I
have
talk
about
it
again
and
again
,

Herbert
pursue
,
"
and
the
dear
little
thing
beg
me
only
this
evening
,
with
tear
in
her
eye
,
to
say
to
you
that
if
you
will
live
with
us
when
we
come
together
,
she
will
do
her
good
to
make
you
happy
,
and
to
convince
her
husband
's
friend
that
he
be
her
friend
too
.
<EOS>
We
should
get
on
so
well
,
Handel
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
thank
her
heartily
,
and
I
thank
him
heartily
,
but
say
I
could
not
yet
make
sure
of
join
him
as
he
so
kindly
offer
.
<EOS>
firstly
,
my
mind
be
too
preoccupied
to
be
able
to
take
in
the
subject
clearly
.
<EOS>
secondly
<EOS>
---
yes
!
<EOS>
secondly
,
there
be
a
vague
something
linger
in
my
thought
that
will
come
out
very
near
the
end
of
this
slight
narrative
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
think
,
Herbert
,
that
you
could
,
without
do
any
injury
to
your
business
,
leave
the
question
open
for
a
little
while

"
for
any
while

cry
Herbert

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
six
month

a
year

not
so
long
as
that

I.

two
or
three
month
at
most
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Herbert
be
highly
delighted
when
we
shake
hand
on
this
arrangement
,
and
say
he
could
now
take
courage
to
tell
me
that
he
believe
he
must
go
away
at
the
end
of
the
week

and
Clara
?

say
I.
  
<EOS>

the
dear
little
thing

return
Herbert
,

hold
dutifully
to
her
father
as
long
as
he
last
;
but
he
will
not
last
long

Mrs

confide
to
me
that

<EOS>

not

better

I
be
afraid

Herbert
:
"
<EOS>
and
then
I
shall
come
back
for
the

little
thing

the
dear
little
thing

I
will
walk
quietly
into
the
near
church
.

remember
!

the

darling
come
of
no
family

my
dear
Handel

never
look
into
the
red
book
,
and
have
not
a
notion
about
her
grandpapa

<EOS>
what
a
fortune
for
the
son
of
my
mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
Saturday
in
that
same
week
,
I
take
my
leave
of
Herbert
---
full
of
bright
hope
,
but
sad
and
sorry
to
leave
me
---
as
he
sit
on
one
of
the
seaport
mail
coach
.
<EOS>
I
go
into
a
coffee
-
house
to
write
a
little
note
to
Clara
,
tell
her
he
have
go
off
,
send
his
love
to
her
over
and
over
again
,
and
then
go
to
my
lonely
home
---
if
it
deserve
the
name
,
for
it
be
now
no
home
to
me
,
and
I
have
no
home
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
stair
I
encounter
Wemmick
,
who
be
come
down
,
after
an
unsuccessful
application
of
his
knuckle
to
my
door
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
him
alone
,
since
the
disastrous
issue
of
the
attempt
flight
;
and
he
have
come
,
in
his
private
and
personal
capacity
,
to
say
a
few
word
of
explanation
in
reference
to
that
failure
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
late
Compeyson
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
"
have
by
little
and
little
get
at
the
bottom
of
half
of
the
regular
business
now
transact
,
and
it
be
from
the
talk
of
some
of
his
people
in
trouble
(
some
of
his
people
be
always
in
trouble
)
<EOS>
that
I
hear
what
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
keep
my
ear
open
,
seem
to
have
them
shut
,
until
I
hear
that
he
be
absent
,
and
I
think
that
would
be
the
good
time
for
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
suppose
now
,
that
it
be
a
part
of
his
policy
,
as
a
very
clever
man
,
habitually
to
deceive
his
own
instrument
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
blame
me
,
I
hope
,
<EOS>
Mr
Pip
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
try
to
serve
you
,
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
as
sure
of
that
,
Wemmick
,
as
you
can
be
,
and
I
thank
you
most
earnestly
for
all
your
interest
and
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
thank
you
very
much
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bad
job
,
"
say
Wemmick
,
scratch
his
head
,
"
and
I
assure
you
I
have
not
be
so
cut
up
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
what
I
look
at
,
be
the
sacrifice
of
so
much
portable
property
.
<EOS>
dear
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
think
of
,
Wemmick
,
be
the
poor
owner
of
the
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
to
be
sure
,
"
say
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
there
can
be
no
objection
to
your
be
sorry
for
him
,
and
I
would
put
down
a
five
-
pound
note
myself
to
get
him
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
what
I
look
at
,
be
this
.
<EOS>
the
late
Compeyson
have
be
beforehand
with
him
in
intelligence
of
his
return
,
and
be
so
determined
to
bring
him
to
book
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
think
he
could
have
be
save
.
<EOS>
whereas
,
the
portable
property
certainly
could
have
be
save
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
difference
between
the
property
and
the
owner
,
do
not
you
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
invite
Wemmick
to
come
up
-
stair
,
and
refresh
himself
with
a
glass
of
grog
before
walk
to
Walworth
.
<EOS>
He
accept
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
drink
his
moderate
allowance
,
he
say
,
with
nothing
to
lead
up
to
it
,
and
after
have
appear
rather
fidgety
:
  
"
what
do
you
think
of
my
meaning
to
take
a
holiday
on
Monday
,
Mr
Pip
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
suppose
you
have
not
do
such
a
thing
these
twelve
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
these
twelve
year
,
more
likely
,
"
say
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
take
a
holiday
.
<EOS>
More
than
that
;
I
be
go
to
take
a
walk
.
<EOS>
More
than
that
;
I
be
go
to
ask
you
to
take
a
walk
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
excuse
myself
,
as
be
but
a
bad
companion
just
then
,
when
Wemmick
anticipate
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
your
engagement
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
know
you
be
out
of
sort
,
Mr
Pip
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
 
\
could
\
 
<EOS>
oblige
me
<EOS>
,
I
should
take
it
as
a
kindness
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
long
walk
,
and
it
be
an
early
one
.
<EOS>
say
it
may
occupy
you
(
include
breakfast
on
the
walk
)
from
eight
to
twelve
.
<EOS>
Could
not
you
stretch
a
point
and
manage
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
do
so
much
for
me
at
various
time
,
that
this
be
very
little
to
do
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
say
I
could
manage
it---
would
manage
it
---
and
he
be
so
very
much
pleased
by
my
acquiescence
,
that
I
be
pleased
too
.
<EOS>
at
his
particular
request
,
I
appoint
to
call
for
him
at
the
Castle
at
half
-
past
eight
on
Monday
morning
,
and
so
we
part
for
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
punctual
to
my
appointment
<EOS>
,
I
ring
at
the
Castle
gate
on
the
Monday
morning
,
and
be
receive
by
Wemmick
himself
:
who
strike
me
as
look
tight
than
usual
,
and
have
a
sleeker
hat
on
.
<EOS>
within
,
there
be
two
glass
of
rum
-
and
-
milk
prepare
,
and
two
biscuit
.
<EOS>
the
Aged
must
have
be
stir
with
the
lark
,
for
,
glance
into
the
perspective
of
his
bedroom
<EOS>
,
I
observe
that
his
bed
be
empty
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
fortify
ourselves
with
the
rum
-
and
-
milk
and
biscuit
,
and
be
go
out
for
the
walk
with
that
training
preparation
on
us
<EOS>
,
I
be
considerably
surprised
to
see
Wemmick
take
up
a
fishing
-
rod
,
and
put
it
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
we
be
not
go
fish
!
"
<EOS>
say
I.
"
no
,
"
return
Wemmick
,
"
but
I
like
to
walk
with
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
this
odd
;
however
,
I
say
nothing
,
and
we
set
off
.
<EOS>
We
go
towards
Camberwell
Green
,
and
when
we
be
thereabout
,
Wemmick
say
suddenly
:
  
"
<EOS>
Halloa
!
<EOS>
here
be
a
church
!
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
very
surprising
in
that
;
but
again
,
I
be
rather
surprised
,
when
he
say
,
as
if
he
be
animate
by
a
brilliant
idea
:
  
"
<EOS>
let
's
go
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
go
in
,
Wemmick
leave
his
fishing
-
rod
in
the
porch
,
and
look
all
round
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
Wemmick
be
dive
into
his
coat
-
pocket
,
and
get
something
out
of
paper
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
be
a
couple
of
pair
of
glove
!
<EOS>
let
's
put
'em
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
as
the
glove
be
white
kid
glove
,
and
as
the
post
-
office
be
widen
to
its
utmost
extent
,
I
now
begin
to
have
my
strong
suspicion
.
<EOS>
They
be
strengthen
into
certainty
when
I
beheld
the
age
enter
at
a
side
door
,
escort
a
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
say
Wemmick
.
<EOS>
"
here
be
Miss
Skiffins
!
<EOS>
let
's
have
a
wedding
.
"
  
<EOS>
that
discreet
damsel
be
attire
as
usual
,
except
that
she
be
now
engage
in
substitute
for
her
green
kid
glove
,
a
pair
of
white
.
<EOS>
the
Aged
be
likewise
occupy
in
prepare
a
similar
sacrifice
for
the
altar
of
Hymen
.
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
,
however
,
experience
so
much
difficulty
in
get
his
glove
on
,
that
Wemmick
find
it
necessary
to
put
him
with
his
back
against
a
pillar
,
and
then
to
get
behind
the
pillar
himself
and
pull
away
at
them
,
while
I
for
my
part
hold
the
old
gentleman
round
the
waist
,
that
he
may
present
an
equal
and
safe
resistance
.
<EOS>
by
dint
of
this
ingenious
scheme
,
his
glove
be
get
on
to
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
the
clerk
and
clergyman
then
appear
,
we
be
range
in
order
at
those
fatal
rail
.
<EOS>
true
to
his
notion
of
seem
to
do
it
all
without
preparation
,
I
hear
Wemmick
say
to
himself
as
he
take
something
out
of
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
before
the
service
begin
,
"
<EOS>
Halloa
!
<EOS>
here
be
a
ring
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
act
in
the
capacity
of
backer
,
or
good
-
man
,
to
the
bridegroom
;
while
a
little
limp
pew
opener
in
a
soft
bonnet
like
a
baby
's
,
make
a
feint
of
be
the
bosom
friend
of
Miss
Skiffins
.
<EOS>
the
responsibility
of
give
the
lady
away
,
devolve
upon
the
Aged
,
which
lead
to
the
clergyman
's
be
unintentionally
scandalize
,
and
it
happen
thus
.
<EOS>
when
he
say
,
"
who
giveth
this
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
?
"
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
,
not
in
the
least
know
what
point
of
the
ceremony
we
have
arrive
at
,
stand
most
amiably
beam
at
the
ten
commandment
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
the
clergyman
say
again
,
"
who
giveth
this
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
?
"
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
be
still
in
a
state
of
most
estimable
unconsciousness
,
the
bridegroom
cry
out
in
his
accustomed
voice
,
"
now
aged
p
you
know
;
who
giveth
?
<EOS>
"
to
which
the
Aged
reply
with
great
briskness
,
before
say
that
 
\
<EOS>
he
\
 
<EOS>
give
,
"
all
right
,
John
,
all
right
,
my
boy
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
clergyman
come
to
so
gloomy
a
pause
upon
it
,
that
I
have
doubt
for
the
moment
whether
we
should
get
completely
marry
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
completely
do
,
however
,
and
when
we
be
go
out
of
church
,
Wemmick
take
the
cover
off
the
font
,
and
put
his
white
glove
in
it
,
and
put
the
cover
on
again
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Wemmick
,
more
heedful
of
the
future
,
put
her
white
glove
in
her
pocket
and
assume
her
green
.
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
now

\
 
Mr
Pip

"
say
Wemmick
,
triumphantly
shoulder
the
fishing
-
rod
as
we
come
out
,
"
let
me
ask
you
whether
anybody
would
suppose
this
to
be
a
wedding
-
party

"
  
<EOS>
Breakfast
have
be
order
at
a
pleasant
little
tavern
,
a
mile
or
so
away
upon
the
rise
ground
beyond
the
Green
;
and
there
be

<EOS>
bagatelle
board
in
the
room
,
in
case
we
should
desire
to
unbend
our
mind
after
the
solemnity
.
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
observe
that
Mrs
Wemmick
no
longer
unwound
Wemmick
's
arm
when
it
adapt
itself
to
her
figure
,
but
sit
in
a
high
-
back
chair
against
the
wall
,
like
a
violoncello
in
its
case
,
and
submit
to
be
embrace
as
that
melodious
instrument
may
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
an
excellent
breakfast
,
and
when
any
one
decline
anything
on
table
,
Wemmick
say
,
"
provide
by
contract

you
know
;
do
not
be
afraid
of
it
!
"
<EOS>
I
drink
to
the
new
couple

drink
to
the
aged

drink
to
the
Castle
,
salute
the
bride
at
parting

make
myself
as
agreeable
as
I
could

<EOS>
Wemmick
come
down
to
the
door
with
me
,
and
I
again
shake
hand
with
him
,
and
wish
him
joy
.

"
Thankee

say
Wemmick
,
rub
his

"
She

such
a

after
what
you
let
out
the

Mr
Jaggers

chapter
56
 
<EOS>
He
lie
in
prison
very
ill
,
during
the
whole
interval
between
his
committal
for
trial
,
and
the
come
round
of
the
Sessions
.
<EOS>
He
have
break
two
rib
,
they
have
wound
one
of
his
lung
,
and
he
breathe
with
great
pain
and
difficulty
,
which
increase
daily
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
consequence
of
his
hurt
,
that
he
speak
so
low
as
to
be
scarcely
audible
;
therefore
,
he
speak
very
little
.
<EOS>
but
,
he
be
ever
ready
to
listen
to
me
,
and
it
become
the
first
duty
of
my
life
to
say
to
him
,
and
read
to
him
,
what
I
know
he
ought
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
be
fur
too
ill
to
remain
in
the
common
prison
,
he
be
remove
,
after
the
first
day
or
so
,
into
the
infirmary
.
<EOS>
this
give
me
opportunity
of
be
with
him
that
I
could
not
otherwise
have
have
.
<EOS>
and
but
for
his
illness
he
would
have
be
put
in
iron
,
for
he
be
regard
as
a
determined
prison
-
breaker
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
else
.
  
<EOS>
although
I
see
him
every
day
,
it
be
for
only
a
short
time
;
hence
,
the
regularly
recur
space
of
our
separation
be
long
enough
to
record
on
his
face
any
alight
change
that
occur
in
his
physical
state
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
recollect
that
I
once
see
any
change
in
it
for
the
well
;
he
waste
,
and
become
slowly
weak
and
bad
,
day
by
day
,
from
the
day
when
the
prison
door
close
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
kind
of
submission
or
resignation
that
he
show
,
be
that
of
a
man
who
be
tired
out
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
derive
an
impression
,
from
his
manner
or
from
a
whispered
word
or
two
which
escape
him
,
that
he
ponder
over
the
question
whether
he
may
have
be
a
well
man
under
well
circumstance
.
<EOS>
but
,
he
never
justify
himself
by
a
hint
tend
that
way
,
or
try
to
bend
the
past
out
of
its
eternal
shape
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
on
two
or
three
occasion
in
my
presence
,
that
his
desperate
reputation
be
allude
to
by
one
or
other
of
the
people
in
attendance
on
him
.
<EOS>
a
smile
cross
his
face
then
,
and
he
turn
his
eye
on
me
with
a
trustful
look
,
as
if
he
be
confident
that
I
have
see
some
small
redeem
touch
in
him
,
even
so
long
ago
as
when
I
be
a
little
child
.
<EOS>
as
to
all
the
rest
,
he
be
humble
and
contrite
,
and
I
never
know
him
complain
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
Sessions
come
round
,
Mr
Jaggers
cause
an
application
to
be
make
for
the
postponement
of
his
trial
until
the
follow
Sessions
.
<EOS>
It
be
obviously
make
with
the
assurance
that
he
could
not
live
so
long
,
and
be
refuse
.
<EOS>
the
trial
come
on
at
once
,
and
,
when
he
be
put
to
the
bar
,
he
be
seat
in
a
chair
.
<EOS>
no
objection
be
make
to
my
get
close
to
the
dock
,
on
the
outside
of
it
,
and
hold
the
hand
that
he
stretch
forth
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
trial
be
very
shod
and
very
clear
.
<EOS>
such
thing
as
could
be
say
for
him
,
be
say
---
how
he
have
take
to
industrious
habit
,
and
have
thrive
lawfully
and
reputably
.
<EOS>
but
,
nothing
could
unsay
the
fact
that
he
have
return
,
and
be
there
in
presence
of
the
Judge
and
Jury
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
try
him
for
that
,
and
do
otherwise
than
find
him
guilty
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
time
,
it
be
the
custom
(
as
I
learn
from
my
terrible
experience
of
that
Sessions
)
to
devote
a
conclude
day
to
the
passing
of
sentence
,
and
to
make
a
finishing
effect
with
the
Sentence
of
Death
.
<EOS>
but
for
the
indelible
picture
that
my
remembrance
now
hold
before
me
,
I
could
scarcely
believe
,
even
as
I
write
these
word
,
that
I
see
two
-
and
-
thirty
man
and
woman
put
before
the
Judge
to
receive
that
sentence
together
.
<EOS>
foremost
among
the
two
-
and
-
thirty
,
be
he
;
seat
,
that
he
may
get
breath
enough
to
keep
life
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
scene
start
out
again
in
the
vivid
colour
of
the
moment
,
down
to
the
drop
of
April
rain
on
the
window
of
the
court
,
glitter
in
the
ray
of
April
sun

<EOS>
pen
in
the
dock
,
as
I
again
stand
outside
it
at
the
corner
with
his
hand
in
mine

be
the
two
-
and
-
thirty
man
and
woman
;
some
defiant
,
some
stricken
with
terror
,
some
sob
and
weeping
,
some
cover
their
face
,
some
stare
gloomily
about
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
shriek
from
among
the
woman
convict
,
but
they
have
be
still
,
and
a
hush
have
succeed
.
<EOS>
the
sheriff
with
their
great
chain
and
nosegay
,
other
civic
gewgaw

a

full
of

a
large
theatrical
audience

look
on

as
the
two

and

thirty
and
the
Judge
be
solemnly
confront
.
<EOS>
then
,
the
Judge
address
them
.
<EOS>
among
the
wretched
creature
before
him
whom
he
must
single
out
for
special
address
,
be
one
who
almost
from
his
infancy
have
be
an
offender
against
the
law
;
who
,
after
repeated
imprisonment
and
punishment
,
have
be
at
length
sentence
to
exile
for
a
term
of
year
;
and
who
,
under
circumstance
of
great
violence
and
daring
have
make
his
escape
and
be
re
-
sentence
to
exile
for
life
.
<EOS>
that
miserable
man
would
seem
for
a
time
to
have
become
convinced
of
his
error
,
when
far
remove
from
the
scene
of
his
old
offence
,
and
to
have
live
a
peaceable
and
honest
life
.
<EOS>
but
in
a
fatal
moment
,
yield
to
those
propensity
and
passion
,
the
indulgence
of
which
have
so
long
render
him
a
scourge
to
society
,
he
have
quit
his
haven
of
rest
and
repentance
,
and
have
come
back
to
the
country
where
he
be
proscribe
.
<EOS>
be
here
presently
denounce
,
he
have
for
a
time
succeed
in
evade
the
officer
of
Justice
,
but
be
at
length
seize
while
in
the
act
of
flight
,
he
have
resist
them
,
and
have
---
he
best
know
whether
by
express
design
,
or
in
the
blindness
of
his
hardihood
---
cause
the
death
of
his
denouncer
,
to
whom
his
whole
career
be
know
.
<EOS>
the
appoint
punishment
for
his
return
to
the
land
that
have
cast
him
out
,
be
death
,
and
his
case
be
this
aggravate
case
,
he
must
prepare
himself
to
die
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
be
strike
in
at
the
great
window
of
the
court
,
through
the
glitter
drop
of
rain
upon
the
glass
,
and
it
make
a
broad
shaft
of
light
between
the
two
-
and
-
thirty
and
the
Judge
,
link
both
together
,
and
perhaps
remind
some
among
the
audience
,
how
both
be
pass
on
,
with
absolute
equality
,
to
the
great
judgment
that
knoweth
all
thing
and
can
not
err
.
<EOS>
rise
for
a
moment
,
a
distinct
speck
of
face
in
this
way
of
light
,
the
prisoner
say
,
"
My
Lord
,
I
have
receive
my
sentence
of
death
from
the
Almighty
,
but
I
bow
to
yours
,
"
and
sit
down
again
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
hushing
,
and
the
Judge
go
on
with
what
he
have
to
say
to
the
rest
.
<EOS>
then
,
they
be
all
formally
doom
,
and
some
of
them
be
support
out
,
and
some
of
them
saunter
out
with
a
haggard
look
of
bravery
,
and
a
few
nod
to
the
gallery
,
and
two
or
three
shake
hand
,
and
other
go
out
chew
the
fragment
of
herb
they
have
take
from
the
sweet
herb
lie
about
.
<EOS>
He
go
last
of
all
,
because
of
have
to
be
help
from
his
chair
and
to
go
very
slowly
;
and
he
hold
my
hand
while
all
the
other
be
remove
,
and
while
the
audience
get
up
(
put
their
dress
right
,
as
they
may
at
church
or
elsewhere
)
and
point
down
at
this
criminal
or
at
that
,
and
most
of
all
at
him
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
earnestly
hope
and
pray
that
he
may
die
before
the
Recorder
's
report
be
make
,
but
,
in
the
dread
of
his
linger
on
,
I
begin
that
night
to
write
out
a
petition
to
the
Home
Secretary
of
State
,
set
forth
my
knowledge
of
him
,
and
how
it
be
that
he
have
come
back
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
I
write
it
as
fervently
and
pathetically
as
I
could
,
and
when
I
have
finish
it
and
send
it
in
,
I
write
out
other
petition
to
such
man
in
authority
as
I
hope
be
the
most
merciful
,
and
draw
up
one
to
the
Crown
itself
.
<EOS>
for
several
day
and
night
after
he
be
sentence
I
take
no
rest
except
when
I
fall
asleep
in
my
chair
,
but
be
wholly
absorb
in
these
appeal
.
<EOS>
and
after
I
have
send
them
in
,
I
could
not
keep
away
from
the
place
where
they
be
,
but
feel
as
if
they
be
more
hopeful
and
less
desperate
when
I
be
near
them
.
<EOS>
in
this
unreasonable
restlessness
and
pain
of
mind
,
I
would
roam
the
street
of
an
evening
,
wander
by
those
office
and
house
where
I
have
leave
the
petition
.
<EOS>
to
the
present
hour
,
the
weary
western
street
of
London
on
a
cold
dusty
spring
night
,
with
their
range
of
stern
shut
-
up
mansion
and
their
long
row
of
lamp
,
be
melancholy
to
me
from
this
association
.
  
<EOS>
the
daily
visit
I
could
make
him
be
shorten
now
,
and
he
be
more
strictly
keep
.
<EOS>
see
,
or
fancy
<EOS>
,
that
I
be
suspect
of
an
intention
of
carry
poison
to
him
,
I
ask
to
be
search
before
I
sit
down
at
his
bedside
,
and
tell
the
officer
who
be
always
there
,
that
I
be
willing
to
do
anything
that
would
assure
him
of
the
singleness
of
my
design
.
<EOS>
nobody
be
hard
with
him
,
or
with
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
duty
to
be
do
,
and
it
be
do
,
but
not
harshly
.
<EOS>
the
officer
always
give
me
the
assurance
that
he
be
bad
,
and
some
other
sick
prisoner
in
the
room
,
and
some
other
prisoner
who
attend
on
them
as
sick
nurse
(
malefactor
,
but
not
incapable
of
kindness
,
GOD
be
thank
!
)
,
always
join
in
the
same
report
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
day
go
on
,
I
notice
more
and
more
that
he
would
lie
placidly
look
at
the
white
ceiling
,
with
an
absence
of
light
in
his
face
,
until
some
word
of
mine
brighten
it
for
an
instant
,
and
then
it
would
subside
again
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
be
almost
,
or
quite
,
unable
to
speak
;
then
,
he
would
answer
me
with
slight
pressure
on
my
hand
,
and
I
grow
to
understand
his
meaning
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
the
number
of
the
day
have
rise
to
ten
,
when
I
see
a
great
change
in
him
than
I
have
see
yet
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
turn
towards
the
door
,
and
light
up
as
I
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
boy
,
"
he
say
,
as
I
sit
down
by
his
bed
:
"
I
think
you
be
late
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
you
could
not
be
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
the
time
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
I
wait
for
it
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
always
wait
at
the
gate
;
do
not
you
,
dear
boy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
not
to
lose
a
moment
of
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
dear
boy
,
thank'ee
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
You
have
never
desert
me
,
dear
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
press
his
hand
in
silence
,
for
I
could
not
forget
that
I
have
once
mean
to
desert
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
the
good
of
all
,
"
he
say
,
"
you
have
be
more
comfortable
alonger
me
,
since
I
be
under
a
dark
cloud
,
than
when
the
sun
shine
.
<EOS>
that
be
good
of
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
lie
on
his
back
,
breathe
with
great
difficulty
.
<EOS>
do
what
he
would
,
and
love
me
though
he
do
,
the
light
leave
his
face
ever
and
again
,
and
a
film
come
over
the
placid
look
at
the
white
ceiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
in
much
pain
to
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
complain
of
none
,
dear
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
do
complain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
speak
his
last
word
.
<EOS>
He
smile
,
and
I
understand
his
touch
to
mean
that
he
wish
to
lift
my
hand
,
and
lie
it
on
his
breast
.
<EOS>
I
lay
it
there
,
and
he
smile
again
,
and
put
both
his
hand
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
allot
time
run
out
,
while
we
be
thus
;
but
,
look
round
,
I
find
the
governor
of
the
prison
stand
near
me
,
and
he
whisper
,
"
You
need
not
go
yet
.
<EOS>
"
I
thank
him
gratefully
,
and
ask
,
"
may
I
speak
to
him
,
if
he
can
hear
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
governor
step
aside
,
and
beckon
the
officer
away
.
<EOS>
the
change
,
though
it
be
make
without
noise
,
draw
back
the
film
from
the
placid
look
at
the
white
ceiling
,
and
he
look
most
affectionately
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Magwitch
,
I
must
tell
you
,
now
at
last
.
<EOS>
You
understand
what
I
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
a
gentle
pressure
on
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
child
once
,
whom
you
love
and
lose
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
strong
pressure
on
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
live
and
find
powerful
friend
.
<EOS>
She
be
live
now
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
lady
and
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
and
I
love
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
with
a
last
faint
effort
,
which
would
have
be
powerless
but
for
my
yielding
to
it
and
assist
it
,
he
raise
my
hand
to
his
lip
.
<EOS>
then
,
he
gently
let
it
sink
upon
his
breast
again
,
with
his
own
hand
lie
on
it
.
<EOS>
the
placid
look
at
the
white
ceiling
come
back
,
and
pass
away
,
and
his
head
drop
quietly
on
his
breast
.
  
<EOS>
Mindful
,
then
,
of
what
we
have
read
together
,
I
think
of
the
two
man
who
go
up
into
the
Temple
to
pray
,
and
I
know
there
be
no
well
word
that
I
could
say
beside
his
bed
,
than
"
o
Lord
,
be
merciful
to
him
,
a
sinner
!
"
    
<EOS>
Chapter
57
 
<EOS>
now
that
I
be
leave
wholly
to
myself
,
I
give
notice
of
my
intention
to
quit
the
chamber
in
the
Temple
as
soon
as
my
tenancy
could
legally
determine
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
to
underlet
them
.
<EOS>
at
once
I
put
bill
up
in
the
window
;
for
,
I
be
in
debt
,
and
have
scarcely
any
money
,
and
begin
to
be
seriously
alarm
by
the
state
of
my
affair
.
<EOS>
I
ought
rather
to
write
that
I
should
have
be
alarm
if
I
have
have
energy
and
concentration
enough
to
help
me
to
the
clear
perception
of
any
truth
beyond
the
fact
that
I
be
full
very
ill
.
<EOS>
the
late
stress
upon
me
have
enable
me
to
put
off
illness
,
but
not
to
put
it
away
;
I
know
that
it
be
come
on
me
now
,
and
I
know
very
little
else
,
and
be
even
careless
as
to
that
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
day
or
two
,
I
lie
on
the
sofa
,
or
on
the
floor
---
anywhere
,
accord
as
I
happen
to
sink
down
---
with
a
heavy
head
and
ache
limb
,
and
no
purpose
,
and
no
power
.
<EOS>
then
there
come
one
night
which
appear
of
great
duration
,
and
which
teem
with
anxiety
and
horror
;
and
when
in
the
morning
I
try
to
sit
up
in
my
bed
and
think
of
it
,
I
find
I
could
not
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
whether
I
really
have
be
down
in
garden
-
court
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
grope
about
for
the
boat
that
I
suppose
to
be
there
;
whether
I
have
two
or
three
time
come
to
myself
on
the
staircase
with
great
terror
,
not
know
how
I
have
get
out
of
bed
;
whether
I
have
find
myself
light
the
lamp
,
possess
by
the
idea
that
he
be
come
up
the
stair
,
and
that
the
light
be
blow
out
;
whether
I
have
be
inexpressibly
harass
by
the
distract
talk
laugh
,
and
groaning
,
of
some
one
,
and
have
half
suspect
those
sound
to
be
of
my
own
making
;
whether
there
have
be
a
closed
iron
furnace
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
,
and
a
voice
have
call
out
over
and
over
again
that
Miss
Havisham
be
consume
within
it
;
these
be
thing
that
I
try
to
settle
with
myself
and
get
into
some
order
,
as
I
lie
that
morning
on
my
bed
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
vapour
of
a
limekiln
would
come
between
me
and
them
,
disorder
them
all
,
and
it
be
through
the
vapour
at
last
that
I
see
two
man
look
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
start
;
"
I
do
not
know
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
return
one
of
them
,
bend
down
and
touch
me
on
the
shoulder
,
"
this
be
a
matter
that
you
will
soon
arrange
,
I
dare
say
,
but
you
be
arrest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
debt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hundred
and
twenty
-
three
pound
,
fifteen
,
six
.
<EOS>
Jeweller
's
account
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
to
be
do
?
"
  
"
You
have
better
come
to
my
house
,
"
say
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
keep
a
very
nice
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
make
some
attempt
to
get
up
and
dress
myself
.
<EOS>
when
I
next
attend
to
them
,
they
be
stand
a
little
off
from
the
bed
,
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
still
lie
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
my
state
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
I
would
come
with
you
if
I
could
;
but
indeed
I
be
quite
unable
.
<EOS>
if
you
take
me
from
here
,
I
think
I
shall
die
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
perhaps
they
reply
,
or
argue
the
point
,
or
try
to
encourage
me
to
believe
that
I
be
well
than
I
think
.
<EOS>
forasmuch
as
they
hang
in
my
memory
by
only
this
one
slender
thread
,
I
do
not
know
what
they
do
,
except
that
they
forbore
to
remove
me
.
  
<EOS>
that
I
have
a
fever
and
be
avoid
,
that
I
suffer
greatly
,
that
I
often
lose
my
reason
,
that
the
time
seem
interminable
,
that
I
confound
impossible
existence
with
my
own
identity
;
that
I
be
a
brick
in
the
house
wall
,
and
yet
entreat
to
be
release
from
the
giddy
place
where
the
builder
have
set
me
;
that
I
be
a
steel
beam
of
a
vast
engine
,
clash
and
whirl
over
a
gulf
,
and
yet
that
I
implore
in
my
own
person
to
have
the
engine
stop
,
and
my
part
in
it
hammer
off
;
that
I
pass
through
these
phase
of
disease
,
I
know
of
my
own
remembrance
,
and
do
in
some
sort
know
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
that
I
sometimes
struggle
with
real
people
,
in
the
belief
that
they
be
murderer
,
and
that
I
would
all
at
once
comprehend
that
they
mean
to
do
me
good
,
and
would
then
sink
exhausted
in
their
arm
,
and
suffer
them
to
lay
me
down
,
I
also
know
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
but
,
above
all
,
I
know
that
there
be
a
constant
tendency
in
all
these
people
---
who
,
when
I
be
very
ill
,
would
present
all
kind
of
extraordinary
transformation
of
the
human
face
,
and
would
be
much
dilate
in
size
---
above
all
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
I
know
that
there
be
an
extraordinary
tendency
in
all
these
people
,
sooner
or
later
to
settle
down
into
the
likeness
of
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
turn
the
bad
point
of
my
illness
,
I
begin
to
notice
that
while
all
its
other
feature
change
,
this
one
consistent
feature
do
not
change
.
<EOS>
whoever
come
about
me
,
still
settle
down
into
Joe
.
<EOS>
I
open
my
eye
in
the
night
,
and
I
see
in
the
great
chair
at
the
bedside
,
Joe
.
<EOS>
I
open
my
eye
in
the
day
,
and
,
sit
on
the
window
-
seat
,
smoke
his
pipe
in
the
shaded
open
window
,
still
I
see
Joe
.
<EOS>
I
ask
for
cool
drink
,
and
the
dear
hand
that
give
it
me
be
Joe
's
.
<EOS>
I
sink
back
on
my
pillow
after
drinking
,
and
the
face
that
look
so
hopefully
and
tenderly
upon
me
be
the
face
of
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
one
day
,
I
take
courage
,
and
say
,
"
\
<EOS>
be
\
 
<EOS>
it
Joe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
the
dear
old
home
-
voice
answer
,
"
which
it
air
,
old
chap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
Joe
,
you
break
my
heart
!
<EOS>
look
angry
at
me
,
Joe
.
<EOS>
strike
me
,
Joe
.
<EOS>
tell
me
of
my
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
so
good
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
for
,
Joe
have
actually
lay
his
head
down
on
the
pillow
at
my
side
and
put
his
arm
round
my
neck
,
in
his
joy
that
I
know
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
which
dear
old
Pip
,
old
chap
,
"
say
Joe
,
"
you
and
me
be
ever
friend
.
<EOS>
and
when
you
be
well
enough
to
go
out
for
a
ride
---
what
lark
!
"
  
<EOS>
after
which
,
Joe
withdraw
to
the
window
,
and
stand
with
his
back
towards
me
,
wipe
his
eye
.
<EOS>
and
as
my
extreme
weakness
prevent
me
from
get
up
and
go
to
him
<EOS>
,
I
lie
there
,
penitently
whisper
,
"
o
God
bless
him
!
<EOS>
o
God
bless
this
gentle
christian
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
Joe
's
eye
be
red
when
I
next
find
him
beside
me
;
but
,
I
be
hold
his
hand
,
and
we
both
feel
happy
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
long
,
dear
Joe
?
"
  
"
which
you
meantersay

Pip

how
long
have
your

<EOS>

pretty
nigh
,
old

<EOS>
for
,
as
I
say
to
Biddy
when
the
news
of
your

bring
by
letter
,
which
it
be
bring
by
the
post
and
be
formerly
single
<EOS>
he
be
now
married
though
underpaid
for
a
deal
of
walking
and
shoe
-
leather
,
but
wealth
be
not
a
object
on
his
part
,
and
marriage
be
the
great
wish
of
his
hart
---
"
  
"
It
be
so
delightful
to
hear
you
,
Joe
!
<EOS>
but
I
interrupt
you
in
what
you
say
to
Biddy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
which
it
be
,
"
say
Joe
,
"
that
how
you
may
be
amongst
stranger
,
and
that
how
you
and
me
have
be
ever
friend
,
a
wisit
at
such
a
moment
may
not
prove
unacceptabobble
.
<EOS>
and
Biddy
,
her
word
be
,
"
go
to
him
,
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
that
,
"
say
Joe
,
sum
up
with
his
judicial
air
,
"
be
the
word
of
Biddy
.
<EOS>
"
go
to
him
,
"
Biddy
say
,
"
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
in
short
,
I
should
not
greatly
deceive
you
,
"
Joe
add
,
after
a
little
grave
reflection
,
"
if
I
represent
to
you
that
the
word
of
that
young
woman
be
,
"
without
a
minute
's
loss
of
time
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
there
Joe
cut
himself
short
,
and
inform
me
that
I
be
to
be
talk
to
in
great
moderation
,
and
that
I
be
to
take
a
little
nourishment
at
state
frequent
time
,
whether
I
feel
inclined
for
it
or
not
,
and
that
I
be
to
submit
myself
to
all
his
order
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
kiss
his
hand
,
and
lie
quiet
,
while
he
proceed
to
indite
a
note
to
Biddy
,
with
my
love
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
evidently
,
Biddy
have
teach
Joe
to
write
.
<EOS>
as
I
lie
in
bed
look
at
him
,
it
make
me
,
in
my
weak
state
,
cry
again
with
pleasure
to
see
the
pride
with
which
he
set
about
his
letter
.
<EOS>
My
bedstead
,
divest
of
its
curtain
,
have
be
remove
,
with
me
upon
it
,
into
the
sitting
-
room
,
as
the
airy
and
large
,
and
the
carpet
have
be
take
away
,
and
the
room
keep
always
fresh
and
wholesome
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
at
my
own
writing
-
table
,
push
into
a
corner
and
cumber
with
little
bottle
,
Joe
now
sit
down
to
his
great
work
,
first
choose
a
pen
from
the
pen
-
tray
as
if
it
be
a
chest
of
large
tool
,
and
tuck
up
his
sleeve
as
if
he
be
go
to
wield
a
crowbar
or
sledge
-
hammer
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
for
Joe
to
hold
on
heavily
to
the
table
with
his
left
elbow
,
and
to
get
his
right
leg
well
out
behind
him
,
before
he
could
begin
,
and
when
he
do
begin
,
he
make
every
down
-
stroke
so
slowly
that
it
may
have
be
six
foot
long
,
while
at
every
up
-
stroke
I
could
hear
his
pen
splutter
extensively
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
curious
idea
that
the
inkstand
be
on
the
side
of
him
where
it
be
not
,
and
constantly
dip
his
pen
into
space
,
and
seem
quite
satisfied
with
the
result
.
<EOS>
occasionally
,
he
be
trip
up
by
some
orthographical
stumbling
-
block
,
but
on
the
whole
he
get
on
very
well
indeed
,
and
when
he
have
sign
his
name
,
and
have
remove
a
finishing
blot
from
the
paper
to
the
crown
of
his
head
with
his
two
forefinger
,
he
get
up
and
hover
about
the
table
,
try
the
effect
of
his
performance
from
various
point
of
view
as
it
lie
there
,
with
unbounded
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
not
to
make
Joe
uneasy
by
talk
too
much
,
even
if
I
have
be
able
to
talk
much
,
I
defer
ask
him
about
Miss
Havisham
until
next
day
.
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
when
I
then
ask
him
if
she
have
recover
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
she
dead

Joe
?
"
  
<EOS>
"

say
Joe
,
in
tone
of
remonstrance
,
and
by
way
of
get
at
it
by
degree
,
"
I
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
,
for
that
be
a
deal
to
say
;

say
Joe
;
still
determine
,
on

to
come
at
everything
by
degree

never

from

conventional

to
make

gain
strength

do
slowly

surely
become
less
weak

stay

so
beautifully
proportion

would
sit

talk
to
me
in
the
old
confidence

with
the
old
simplicity

in
the
old
unassertive
protect
way

half
believe

I
do

you

would
often
say

in
explanation
of
that
liberty

I
find
her
a
tap
the

off

<EOS>
We
look
forward
to
the
day
when
I
should
go
out
for
a
ride
,
as
we
have
once
look
forward
to
the
day
of
my
apprenticeship
.
<EOS>
and
when
the
day
come
,
and
an
open
carriage
be
get
into
the
Lane
,
Joe
wrap
me
up
,
take
me
in
his
arm
,
carry
me
down
to
it
,
and
put
me
in
,
as
if
I
be
still
the
small
helpless
creature
to
whom
he
have
so
abundantly
give
of
the
wealth
of
his
great
nature
.
  
<EOS>
and
Joe
get
in
beside
me
,
and
we
drive
away
together
into
the
country
,
where
the
rich
summer
growth
be
already
on
the
tree
and
on
the
grass
,
and
sweet
summer
scent
fill
all
the
air
.
<EOS>
the
day
happen
to
be
Sunday
,
and
when
I
look
on
the
loveliness
around
me
,
and
think
how
it
have
grow
and
change
,
and
how
the
little
wild
flower
have
be
form
,
and
the
voice
of
the
bird
have
be
strengthen
,
by
day
and
by
night
,
under
the
sun
and
under
the
star
,
while
poor
I
lay
burn
and
toss
on
my
bed
,
the
mere
remembrance
of
have
burn
and
toss
there
,
come
like
a
check
upon
my
peace
.
<EOS>
but
,
when
I
hear
the
Sunday
bell
,
and
look
around
a
little
more
upon
the
outspread
beauty
,
I
feel
that
I
be
not
nearly
thankful
enough
---
that
I
be
too
weak
yet
,
to
be
even
that
---
and
I
lay
my
head
on
Joe
's
shoulder
,
as
I
have
lay
it
long
ago
when
he
have
take
me
to
the
Fair
or
where
not
,
and
it
be
too
much
for
my
young
sense
.
  
<EOS>
more
composure
come
to
me
after
a
while
,
and
we
talk
as
we
use
to
talk
,
lie
on
the
grass
at
the
old
Battery
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
change
whatever
in
Joe
.
<EOS>
exactly
what
he
have
be
in
my
eye
then
,
he
be
in
my
eye
still
;
just
as
simply
faithful
,
and
as
simply
right
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
get
back
again
<EOS>
and
he
lift
me
out
,
and
carry
me
---
so
easily
---
across
the
court
and
up
the
stair
<EOS>
,
I
think
of
that
eventful
Christmas
Day
when
he
have
carry
me
over
the
marsh
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
yet
make
any
allusion
to
my
change
of
fortune
,
nor
do
I
know
how
much
of
my
late
history
he
be
acquaint
with
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
doubtful
of
myself
now
,
and
put
so
much
trust
in
him
,
that
I
could
not
satisfy
myself
whether
I
ought
to
refer
to
it
when
he
do
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
hear
,
Joe
,
"
I
ask
him
that
evening
,
upon
further
consideration
,
as
he
smoke
his
pipe
at
the
window
,
"
who
my
patron

I
do

my

<EOS>
for
when
your

it

not

much
,
"
say
Joe

in

argumentative
way
,
"
that
she
drop
into

if
I
put
myself
in

that
she
drop
into
you
always
heavier
for
it

<EOS>
I
notice
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
grab
at
a

when

Biddy

herself
<EOS>
a
deal
o

trouble
with

afore

leave
(
for
I
be
almost
awful
dull

as
I
should
view

view

in

light

both
of

quite

be
do

now
this
to
you
a
true

say

<EOS>
namely
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
go
a
over
-
doing
on
it
,
but
you
must
have
your
supper
and
your
wine
-
and
-
water
,
and
you
must
be
put
betwixt
the
sheet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
delicacy
with
which
Joe
dismiss
this
theme
,
and
the
sweet
tact
and
kindness
with
which
Biddy
---
who
with
her
woman
's
wit
have
find
me
out
so
soon
---
have
prepare
him
for
it
,
make
a
deep
impression
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
but
whether
Joe
know
how
poor
I
be
,
and
how
my
great
expectation
have
all
dissolve
,
like
our
own
marsh
mist
before
the
sun
,
I
could
not
understand
.
  
<EOS>
another
thing
in
Joe
that
I
could
not
understand
when
it
first
begin
to
develop
itself
,
but
which
I
soon
arrive
at
a
sorrowful
comprehension
of
,
be
this
:
as
I
become
strong
and
well
,
Joe
become
a
little
less
easy
with
me
.
<EOS>
in
my
weakness
and
entire
dependence
on
him
,
the
dear
fellow
have
fall
into
the
old
tone
,
and
call
me
by
the
old
name
,
the
dear
"
old
Pip
,
old
chap
,
"
that
now
be
music
in
my
ear
.
<EOS>
I
too
have
fall
into
the
old
way
,
only
happy
and
thankful
<EOS>
that
he
let
me
.
<EOS>
but
,
imperceptibly
,
though
I
hold
by
them
fast
,
Joe
's
hold
upon
them
begin
to
slacken
;
and
whereas
I
wonder
at
this
,
at
first
,
I
soon
begin
to
understand
that
the
cause
of
it
be
in
me
,
and
that
the
fault
of
it
be
all
mine
.
  
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
have
I
give
Joe
no
reason
to
doubt
my
constancy
,
and
to
think
that
in
prosperity
I
should
grow
cold
to
him
and
cast
him
off
?
<EOS>
have
I
give
Joe
's
innocent
heart
<EOS>
no
cause
to
feel
instinctively
that
as
I
get
strong
,
his
hold
upon
me
would
be
weak
,
and
that
he
have
better
loosen
it
in
time
and
let
me
go
,
before
I
pluck
myself
away
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
third
or
fourth
occasion
of
my
go
out
walk
in
the
Temple
Gardens
<EOS>
lean
on
Joe
's
arm
,
that
I
see
this
change
in
him
very
plainly
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
sit
in
the
bright
warm
sunlight
,
look
at
the
river
,
and
I
chance
to
say
as
we
get
up
:
  
<EOS>
"
see
,
Joe
!
<EOS>
I
can
walk
quite
strongly
.
<EOS>
now
,
you
shall
see
me
walk
back
by
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
which
do
not
over
-
do
it
,
Pip
,
"
say
Joe
;
"
but
I
shall
be
happy
fur
to
see
you
able
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
last
word
grate
on
me
;
but
how
could
I
remonstrate
!
<EOS>
I
walk
no
further
than
the
gate
of
the
gardens
,
and
then
pretend
to
be
weak
than
I
be
,
and
ask
Joe
for
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Joe
give
it
me
,
but
be
thoughtful
.
  
<EOS>
I
,
for
my
part
,
be
thoughtful
too
;
for
,
how
good
to
check
this
grow
change
in
Joe
,
be
a
great
perplexity
to
my
remorseful
thought
.
<EOS>
that
I
be
ashamed
to
tell
him
exactly
how
I
be
place
,
and
what
I
have
come
down
to
,
I
do
not
seek
to
conceal
;
but
,
I
hope
my
reluctance
be
not
quite
an
unworthy
one
.
<EOS>
He
would
want
to
help
me
out
of
his
little
saving
,
I
know
,
and
I
know
that
he
ought
not
to
help
me
,
and
that
I
must
not
suffer
him
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
thoughtful
evening
with
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
but
,
before
we
go
to
bed
,
I
have
resolve
that
I
would
wait
over
to
-
morrow
,
to
-
morrow
be
Sunday
,
and
would
begin
my
new
course
with
the
new
week
.
<EOS>
on
Monday
morning
I
would
speak
to
Joe
about
this
change
,
I
would
lay
aside
this
last
vestige
of
reserve
,
I
would
tell
him
what
I
have
in
my
thought
(
that
secondly
,
not
yet
arrive
at
)
,
and
why
I
have
not
decide
to
go
out
to
Herbert
,
and
then
the
change
would
be
conquer
for
ever
.
<EOS>
as
I
clear
,
Joe
clear
,
and
it
seem
as
though
he
have
sympathetically
arrive
at
a
resolution
too
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
quiet
day
on
the
Sunday
,
and
we
ride
out
into
the
country
,
and
then
walk
in
the
field
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
thankful
that
I
have
be
ill
,
Joe
,
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
old
Pip

It

<EOS>

likeway
for
myself

Joe

.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
have
a
time
together
,
Joe
,
that
I
can
never

<EOS>
there
be
day
once
,
I
know
,
<EOS>
that
I
do
for
a

I
never
shall

these

"
  
<EOS>
"
Pip

Joe

appear
a
little
hurried
and
troubled
,
"
there

be
lark

and
,
dear
sir
,
what
have
be
betwixt

have
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
night
,
when
I
have
go
to
bed
,
Joe
come
into
my
room
,
as
he
have
do
all
through
my
recovery
.
<EOS>
He
ask
me
if
I
feel
sure
that
I
be
as
well
as
in
the
morning
?
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
dear
Joe
,
quite
.
"
  
"
and
be
always
a
get
strong
,
old
chap
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
dear
Joe
,
steadily
.
"
  
<EOS>
Joe
pat
the
coverlet
on
my
shoulder
with
his
great
good
hand
,
and
say
,
in
what
I
think
a
husky
voice
,
"
good
night
!
"
  
<EOS>
when
I
get
up
in
the
morning
,
refresh
and
strong
<EOS>
yet
,
I
be
full
of
my
resolution
to
tell
Joe
all
,
without
delay
.
<EOS>
I
would
tell
him
before
breakfast
.
<EOS>
I
would
dress
at
once
and
go
to
his
room
and
surprise
him
;
for
,
it
be
the
first
day
I
have
be
up
early
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
his
room
,
and
he
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
not
only
be
he
not
there
,
but
his
box
be
go

<EOS>
I
hurry
then
to
the
breakfast
-
table
,
and
on
it
find
a
letter
.
<EOS>
these
be
its
brief
content

<EOS>
enclose
in
the
letter
,
be
a
receipt
for
the
debt
and
cost
on
which
I
have
be
arrest
.
<EOS>
down
to
that
moment
I
have
vainly
suppose
that
my
creditor
have
withdraw
or
suspend
proceeding
until
I
should
be
quite
recover
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
dream
of
Joe
's
have
pay
the
money
;
but
,
Joe
have
pay
it
,
and
the
receipt
be
in
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
what
remain
for
me
now
,
but
to
follow
him
to
the
dear
old
forge
,
and
there
to
have
out
my
disclosure
to
him
,
and
my
penitent
remonstrance
with
him
,
and
there
to
relieve
my
mind
and
heart
of
that
reserve
secondly
,
which
have
begin
as
a
vague
something
linger
in
my
thought
,
and
have
form
into
a
settle
purpose
?
  
<EOS>
the
purpose
be
,
that
I
would
go
to
Biddy
,
that
I
would
show
her
how
humble
and
repentant
<EOS>
I
come
back
,
that
I
would
tell
her
how
I
have
lose
all
I
once
hope
for
,
that
I
would
remind
her
of
our
old
confidence
in
my
first
unhappy
time
.
<EOS>
then
,
I
would
say
to
her
,
"
Biddy
,
I
think
you
once
like
me
very
well
,
when
my
errant
heart
,
even
while
it
stray
away
from
you
,
be
quieter
and
better
with
you
than
it
ever
have
be
since
.
<EOS>
if
you
can
like
me
<EOS>
only
half
as
well
once
more
,
if
you
can
take
me
with
all
my
fault
and
disappointment
on
my
head
,
if
you
can
receive
me
like
a
forgive
child
(
and
indeed
I
be
as
sorry
,
Biddy
,
and
have
as
much
need
of
a
hushing
voice
and
a
soothing
hand
)
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
be
a
little
worthier
of
you
than
I
be
---
not
much
,
but
a
little
.
<EOS>
and
,
Biddy
,
it
shall
rest
with
you
to
say
whether
I
shall
work
at
the
forge
with
Joe
,
or
whether
I
shall
try
for
any
different
occupation
down
in
this
country
,
or
whether
we
shall
go
away
to
a
distant
place
where
an
opportunity
await
me
,
which
I
set
aside
when
it
be
offer
,
until
I
know
your
answer
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
dear
Biddy
,
if
you
can
tell
me
that
you
will
go
through
the
world
with
me
,
you
will
surely
make
it
a
well
world
for
me
,
and
me
a
well
man
for
it
,
and
I
will
try
hard
to
make
it
a
well
world
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
such
be
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
after
three
day
more
of
recovery
,
I
go
down
to
the
old
place
,
to
put
it
in
execution
;
and
how
I
speed
in
it
,
be
all
I
have
leave
to
tell
.

Chapter
58
 
<EOS>
the
tiding
of
my
high
fortune
have
have
a
heavy
fall
,
have
get
down
to
my
native
place
and
its
neighbourhood
,
before
I
get
there
.
<EOS>
I
find
the
Blue
Boar
in
possession
of
the
intelligence
,
and
I
find
that
it
make
a
great
change
in
the
Boar
's
demeanour
.
<EOS>
whereas
the
Boar
have
cultivate
my
good
opinion
with
warm
assiduity
when
I
be
come
into
property
,
the
Boar
be
exceedingly
cool
on
the
subject
now
that
I
be
go
out
of
property
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
evening
when
I
arrive
,
much
fatigue
by
the
journey
I
have
so
often
make
so
easily
.
<EOS>
the
Boar
could
not
put
me
into
my
usual
bedroom
,
which
be
engage
(
probably
by
some
one
who
have
expectation
)
,
and
could
only
assign
me
a
very
indifferent
chamber
among
the
pigeon
and
post
-
chaise
up
the
yard
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
have
as
sound
asleep
in
that
lodging
as
in
the
most
superior
accommodation
<EOS>
the
Boar
could
have
give
me
,
and
the
quality
of
my
dream
be
about
the
same
as
in
the
good
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
while
my
breakfast
be
get
ready
,
I
stroll
round
by
Satis
House
.
<EOS>
there
be
print
bill
on
the
gate
,
and
on
bit
of
carpet
hang
out
of
the
window
,
announce
a
sale
by

<EOS>
step
in
for
a
moment
at
the
open
gate
and
look
around
me
with
the
uncomfortable
air
of
a
stranger
who
have
no
business
there
,
I
see
the
auctioneer
's
clerk
walk
on
the
cask
and
tell
them
off
for
the
information
of
a
catalogue
compiler
,
pen
in
hand
,
who
make
a
temporary
desk
of
the
wheeled
chair
I
have
so
often
push
along
to
the
tune
of
Old
Clem
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
get
back
to
my
breakfast
in
the
Boar

coffee
-

,
I
find
Mr
Pumblechook

"
  
<EOS>
as
he
extend
his
hand
with
a
magnificently
forgiving
air
,
and
as
I
be
break
by
illness
and
unfit
to
quarrel
,
I
take
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
William

"
  
<EOS>
I
frowningly
sit
down
to
my
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pumblechook
stand
over
me
and
pour
out
my
tea
---
before
I
could
touch
the
teapot
---
with
the
air
of
a
benefactor
who
be
resolve
to
be
true
to
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
William

Mr

mournfully

<EOS>
"
You

"
return
Mr
Pumblechook
,
sighing
and
nod
his
head
several
time
,
as
if
he
may
have
expect
that
,
and
as
if
abstinence
from
watercress
be
consistent
with
my
downfall
.

William

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
go
on
with
my
breakfast
,
and
Mr
Pumblechook
continue
to
stand
over
me
,
stare
fishily
and
breathe
noisily
,
as
he
always
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
little
more
than
skin
and
bone
!
"
muse
Mr
Pumblechook
,
aloud
.
"
<EOS>
and
yet
when
he
go
away
from
here
(
I
may
say
with
my
blessing
)
,
and
I
spread
afore
him
my
humble
store
,
like
the
Bee
,
he
be
as
plump
as
a
Peach
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
remind
me
of
the
wonderful
difference
between
the
servile
manner
in
which
he
have
offer
his
hand
in
my
new
prosperity
,
say
,
"
May
I
?
"
and
the
ostentatious
clemency
with
which
he
have
just
now
exhibit
the
same
fat
five
finger
.
  
<EOS>
"
hah
!
<EOS>
"
he
go
on
,
hand
me
the
bread
-
and
-
butter
.
"
<EOS>
and
air
you
a
go
to
Joseph
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
Heaven
's
name

say
I
,
<EOS>
fire
in
spite
of
myself
,
"
what
do
it
matter
to
you
where
I
be
go
?
<EOS>
leave
that
teapot
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
bad
course
I
could
have
take
,
because
it
give
Pumblechook
the
opportunity
he
want
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
young
man
,
"
say
he
,
release
the
handle
of
the
article
in
question
,
retire
a
step
or
two
from
my
table
,
and
speak
for
the
behoof
of
the
landlord
and
waiter
at
the
door
<EOS>
,
"
I
 
\
will
\
 
<EOS>
leave

<EOS>
You
be
right
,
young
man
.
<EOS>
for
once
,
you
be
right
.
<EOS>
I
forgit
myself
when
I
take
such
an
interest
in
your
breakfast
,
as
to
wish
your
frame
,
exhaust
by
the
debilitate
effect
of
prodigygality
,
to
be
stimilate
by
the
'
olesome
nourishment
of
your
forefather
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
"
say
Pumblechook
,
turn
to
the
landlord
and
waiter
,
and
point
me
out
at
arm
's
length
,
"
this
be
him
as
I
ever
sport
with
in
his
day
of
happy
infancy

<EOS>
tell
me
not

can
not

I
tell
you

"
  
<EOS>
a
low
murmur
from
the
two
reply
.
<EOS>
the
waiter
appear
to
be
particularly
affect
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
him

"
say
Pumblechook
,
"
as
I

him
deny

"
  
<EOS>
the
waiter
seem
convinced
that
I
could
not
deny
it
,
and
that
it
give
the
case
a
black
look
.
  
<EOS>
"

Pumblechook
,

get
over
that

Pumblechook

and
all
this
with
a
most
exasperating
air
of
say
in
the
cause
of
virtue

be
perfectly
convincing

conclusive

with

the
Impostor
shake
them
both
by

with
an

the
house

leave
me
much
more
astonished

indefinite

it

I
be
not
long
after
him
in
leave
the
house
too
,
and
when
I
go
down
the
high
-
street
I
see
him
hold
forth
(
no
doubt
to
the
same
effect
)
at
his
shop
door
to
a
select
group
,
who
honour
me
with
very
unfavourable
glance
as
I
pass
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
it
be
only
the
pleasanter
to
turn
to
Biddy

to
Joe
,
whose
great
forbearance
shine
more
brightly
than
before
,
<EOS>
if
that
could
be
,
contrast
with
this
brazen
pretender

I
go
towards
them
slowly

for
my
limb
be
weak

with
a
sense
of
increase
relief
as
I
draw
near
to
them

a
sense

arrogance

untruthfulness

further
behind

I
think
all
that
country

side
more
beautiful
and
peaceful
by
fur
than
I
have
ever
know
it
to
be
yet
.
<EOS>
many
pleasant
picture
of
the
life
that
I
would
lead
there
,
and
of
the
change
for
the
well
that
would
come
over
my
character
when
I
have
a
guide
spirit
at
my
side
whose
simple
faith
and
clear
home
-
wisdom
<EOS>
I
have
prove
,
beguile
my

<EOS>
They
awaken
a
tender
emotion
in
me
;
for
,
my
heart
be
soften
by
my
return
,
and
such
a
change
have
come
to
pass
<EOS>
,
that
I
feel
like
one
who
be
toil
home
barefoot
from
distant
travel
,
and
whose
wandering
have
last
many
year
.
  
<EOS>
the
schoolhouse
where
Biddy
be
mistress
,
I
have
never
see
;
but
,
the
little
roundabout
lane
by
which
I
enter
the
village
for
quietness
'
sake
,
take
me
past
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
disappointed
to
find
that
the
day
be
a
holiday
;
no
child
be
there
,
and
Biddy
's
house
be
close
.
<EOS>
some
hopeful
notion
of
see
her
busily
engage
in
her
daily
duty
,
before
she
see
me
,
have
be
in
my
mind
and
be
defeat
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
the
forge
be
a
very
short
distance
off
,
and
I
go
towards
it
under
the
sweet
green
lime
,
listen
for
the
clink
of
Joe
's
hammer
.
<EOS>
long
after
I
ought
to
have
hear
it
,
and
long
after
I
have
fancy
I
hear
it
and
find
it
but
<EOS>
a
fancy
,
all
be
still
.
<EOS>
the
lime
be
there
,
and
the
white
thorn
be
there
,
and
the
chestnut
-
tree
be
there
,
and
their
leave
rustle
harmoniously
when
I
stop
to
listen
;
but
,
the
clink
of
Joe
's
hammer
be
not
in
the
midsummer
wind
.
  
<EOS>
almost
tear
,
without
know
why
,
to
come
in
view
of
the
forge
,
I
see
it
at
last
,
and
see
that
it
be
closed
.
<EOS>
no
gleam
of
fire
,
no
glitter
shower
of
spark
,
no
roar
of
bellow
;
all
shut
up
,
and
still
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
the
house
be
not
desert
,
and
the
good
parlour
seem
to
be
in
use
,
for
there
be
white
curtain
flutter
in
its
window
,
and
the
window
be
open
and
gay
with
flower
.
<EOS>
I
go
softly
towards
it
,
mean
to
peep
over
the
flower
,
when
Joe
and
Biddy
stand
before
me
,
arm
in
arm
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
Biddy
give
a
cry
,
as
if
she
think
it
be
my
apparition
,
but
in
another
moment
she
be
in
my
embrace
.
<EOS>
I
weep
to
see
her
,
and
she
weep
to
see
me
;
<EOS>
I
,
because
she
look
so
fresh
and
pleasant
;
she
,
because
I
look
so
worn
and
white
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
dear
Biddy
,
how
smart
you
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
"
yes

I
look
at
both
of
them
,
from
one
to
the
other
,
and
then
---
  
"
It

my
wedding

cry
Biddy
,
in
a
burst
of
happiness

<EOS>
They
have
take
me
into
the
kitchen
,
and

They

so
proud

so
touch

so
delighted

<EOS>
My
first
thought
be
one
of
great
thankfulness
that
I
have
never

this
last
baffle
hope
to
Joe

how
often

have
it
rise
to
my

<EOS>
how
irrevocable
would
have
be
his
knowledge
of
it
,
if

have
remain
with
me

another
hour

I
suppose
I

<EOS>
I
sell
all
I
have

put
aside
as
much
as
I
could
,
for
a
composition
with
my
creditor
---
who
give
me
ample
time
to
pay
them
in
full

<EOS>
and
I
go
out
and
join
Herbert

<EOS>
within
a
month
,
I
have
quit
England
,
and
within
two
month
I
be
clerk

Clarriker

Co.

within
four
month
I
assume
my

undivided
responsibility

<EOS>
for

the

across
the

Mill
Pond
Bank

have
then
cease

Bill
Barley

growl

be
at
peace

and
Herbert
have
go
away
to
marry
Clara
,
and
I
be
leave
in
sole
charge
of
the
Eastern
Branch
until
he
bring
her
back
.
  
<EOS>
many
a
year
go
round
,
before
I
be
a
partner
in
the
House
;
but
,
I
live
happily
with
Herbert
and
his
wife
,
and
live
frugally
,
and
pay
my
debt
,
and
maintain
a
constant
correspondence
with
Biddy
and
Joe
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
I
become
third
in
the
Firm
,
that
Clarriker
betray
me
to
Herbert
;
but
,
he
then
declare
that
the
secret
of
Herbert
's
partnership
have
be
long
enough
upon
his
conscience
,
and
he
must
tell
it

<EOS>
so
,
he
tell
it
,

Herbert
be
as
much
move
as
amazed
,
and
the
dear
fellow
<EOS>
and
I
be
not
the
bad
friend
for
the
long
concealment

<EOS>
I
must
not
leave
it
to
be
suppose
that
we
be
ever
a
great
House
,
or
that
we
make
mint
of
money

<EOS>
We
be
not

way
of
business

but
we
have
a
good
name
,
and
work
for
our
profit

do
very
well

<EOS>
We
owe
so
much
to
Herbert
's
ever
cheerful
industry
and
readiness
,
that
I
often
wonder
how
I
have
conceive
that
old
idea
of
his
inaptitude
,
until
I
be
one
day
enlighten
by
the
reflection
,
that
perhaps
the
inaptitude
have
never
be
in
him
at
all
,
but
have
be
in

Chapter
59
 
for
eleven
year
,
I
have
not
see
Joe
nor
Biddy
with
my
bodily
eye
---
though
they
have
both
be
often
before
my
fancy
in
the
East
---
when
,
upon
an
evening
in
December
,
an
hour
or
two
after
dark
,
I
lay
my
hand
softly
on
the
latch
of
the
old
kitchen
door
.
<EOS>
I
touch
it
so
softly
that
I
be
not
hear
,
and
look
in
unseen
.
<EOS>
there
,
smoke
his
pipe
in
the
old
place
by
the
kitchen
firelight
,
as
hale
and
as
strong
as
ever
though
a
little
grey
,
sit
Joe
;
and
there
,
fence
into
the
corner
with
Joe
's
leg
,
and
sit
on
my
own
little
stool
look
at
the
fire
,
be
---
I
again
!
  
<EOS>
"
We
giv
'
<EOS>
him
<EOS>
the
name
of
Pip
for
your

,
dear
old
chap
,
"
say
Joe
,
delighted
when
I
take
another
stool
by
the
child
's
side
<EOS>
(
but
I
do
 
<EOS>
\
<EOS>
not
\
 
rumple
his
hair
)
,
"
<EOS>
and
we
hope
he
may
grow
a
little
bit
like
you
,
and
we
think
he
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
,
and
I
take
him
out
for
a
walk
next
morning
,
and
we
talk
immensely
,
understand
one
another
to
perfection
.
<EOS>
and
I
take
him
down
to
the
churchyard
,
and
set
him
on
a
certain
tombstone
there
,
and
he
show
me
from
that
elevation
which
stone
be
sacred
to
the
memory
of
Philip
Pirrip
,
late
of
this
Parish

also

I
,
when
I
talk
with

after
dinner
,
as
her

lie
sleep
in
her
lap
,
"
you

give

"
  
"
no

,
gently
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
marry

"
  
<EOS>
"
so
Herbert
and
Clara
say
,
but
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
shall
,
Biddy
.
<EOS>
I
have
so
settle
down
in
their
home
,
that
it
be
not
at
all
likely
.
<EOS>
I
be
already
quite
an
old
bachelor
.
"
  
<EOS>
Biddy
look
down
at
her
child
,
and
put
its
little
hand
to
her
lip
,
and
then
put
the
good
matronly
hand
with
which
she
have
touch
it
,
into
mine
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
action
and
in
the
light
pressure
of
Biddy
's
wedding
-
ring
,
that
have
a
very
pretty
eloquence
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
Pip
,
"
say
Biddy
,
"
you
be
sure
you
do
not
fret
for
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
o
no

I
think
not

Biddy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
as
an
old

old
friend

<EOS>
have
you
quite

<EOS>
"
My
dear
Biddy
,
I
have
forget
nothing
in
my
life
that
ever
have
a
foremost
place
there
,
and
little
that
ever
have
any
place
there

<EOS>
but
that
poor
dream
,
as
I
once
use
to
call
it
,
have
all
go
by
,
<EOS>
Biddy
,
all
go
by
!
"
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
know
while
I
say
those
word
,
that
I
secretly
intend
to
revisit
the
site
of
the
old
house
that
evening
,
alone
,
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
yes
even
so
.
<EOS>
for
Estella
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
her
as
lead
a
most
unhappy
life
,
and
as
be
separate
from
her
husband
,
who
have
use
her
with
great
cruelty
,
and
who
have
become
quite
renowned
as
a
compound
of
pride
,
avarice
,
brutality
,
and
meanness
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
hear
of
the
death
of
her
husband
,
from
an
accident
consequent
on
his
ill
-
treatment
of
a
horse
.
<EOS>
this
release
have
befall
her
some
two
year
before
;
for
anything
I
know
,
she
be
marry
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
early
dinner
-
hour
at
Joe
's
,
leave
me
abundance
of
time
,
without
hurry
my
talk
with
Biddy
,
to
walk
over
to
the
old
spot
before
dark
.
<EOS>
but
,
what
with
loiter
on
the
way
,
to
look
at
old
object
and
to
think
of
old
time
,
the
day
have
quite
decline
when
I
come
to
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
house
now
,
no
brewery
,
no
building
whatever
leave
,
but
the
wall
of
the
old
garden
.
<EOS>
the
cleared
space
have
be
enclose
with
a
rough
fence
,
and
,
look
over
it
,
I
see
that
some
of
the
old
ivy
have
strike
root
anew
,
and
be
grow
green
on
low
quiet
mound
of
ruin
.
<EOS>
a
gate
in
the
fence
stand
ajar
<EOS>
,
I
push
it
open
,
and
go
in
.
  
<EOS>
a
cold
silvery
mist
have
veil
the
afternoon
,
and
the
moon
be
not
yet
up
to
scatter
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
star
be
shine
beyond
the
mist
,
and
the
moon
be
come
,
and
the
evening
be
not
dark
.
<EOS>
I
could
trace
out
where
every
part
of
the
old
house
have
be
,
and
where
the
brewery
have
be
,
and
where
the
gate
,
and
where
the
cask
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
so
,
and
be
look
along
the
desolate
garden
-
walk
,
when
I
beheld
a
solitary
figure
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
figure
show
itself
aware
of
me
,
as
I
advance
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
move
towards
me
,
but
it
stand
still
.
<EOS>
as
I
draw
near
,
I
see
it
to
be
the
figure
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
as
I
draw
nearer
yet
,
it
be
about
to
turn
away
,
when
it
stop
,
and
let
me
come
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
then
,
it
falter
as
if
much
surprised
,
and
utter
my
name
,
and
I
cry
out
:
  
"
Estella
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
greatly
change
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
know
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
freshness
of
her
beauty
be
indeed
go
,
but
its
indescribable
majesty
and
its
indescribable
charm
remain
.
<EOS>
those
attraction
in
it
,
I
have
see
before
<EOS>
;
what
I
have
never
see
before
,
be
the
sadden
softened
light
of
the
once
proud
eye
;
what
I
have
never
feel
before
,
be
the
friendly
touch
of
the
once
insensible
hand
.
  
<EOS>
We
sit
down
on
a
bench
that
be
near
,
and
I
say
,
"
after
so
many
year
,
it
be
strange
that
we
should
thus
meet
again
,
Estella
,
here
where
our
first
meeting
be
!
<EOS>
do
you
often
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
be
here
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
nor
I.
"
  
the
moon
begin
to
rise
,
and
I
think
of
the
placid
look
at
the
white
ceiling
,
which
have
pass
away
.
<EOS>
the
moon
begin
to
rise
,
and
I
think
of
the
pressure
on
my
hand
when
I
have
speak
the
last
word
he
have
hear
on
earth
.
  
<EOS>
Estella
be
the
next
to
break
the
silence
that
ensue
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
very
often
hope
and
intend
to
come
back
,
but
have
be
prevent
by
many
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
poor
,
poor
old
place
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
silvery
mist
be
touch
with
the
first
ray
of
the
moonlight
,
and
the
same
ray
touch
the
tear
that
drop
from
her
eye
.
<EOS>
not
know
that
I
see
them
,
and
set
herself
to
get
the
well
of
them
,
she
say
quietly
:
  
"
be
you
wonder
,
as
you
walk
along
,
how
it
come
to
be

"
<EOS>
yes

possession
I
have
not
relinquish
.
<EOS>
everything
else
have
go
from
me
,
little
by
little
,
but
I
have
keep
this
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
subject
of
the
only
determined
resistance
I
make
in
all
the
wretched
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
it
to
be
build
on
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
last
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
come
here
to
take
leave
of
it
before
its
change
.
<EOS>
and
you
,
"
she
say
,
in
a
voice
of
touch
interest
to
a
wanderer
,
"
you
live
abroad
still
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
do
well
,
I
be
sure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
work
pretty
hard
for
a
sufficient
living
,
and
therefore
---
yes
,
I
do
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
think
of
you
,
"
say
Estella
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
late
,
very
often
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
long
hard
time
when
I
keep
far
from
me
,
the
remembrance
of
what
I
have
throw
away
when
I
be
quite
ignorant
of
its
worth
.
<EOS>
but
,
since
my
duty
have
not
be
incompatible
with
the
admission
of
that
remembrance
,
I
have
give
it
a
place
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
always
hold
your
place
in
 
\
<EOS>
my
\
 
heart
,
"
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
and
we
be
silent
again
,
until
she
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
little
think
,
"
say
Estella
,
"
that
I
should
take
leave
of
you
in
take
leave
of
this
spot
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
glad
to
part
again
,
Estella
?
<EOS>
to
me
,
parting
be
a
painful
thing
.
<EOS>
to
me
,
the
remembrance
of
our
last
parting
have
be
ever
mournful
and
painful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
say
to
me
,
"
return
Estella
,
very
earnestly
,
"
"
God
bless
you
,
God
forgive
you
!
"
<EOS>
and
if
you
could
say
that
to
me
then
,
you
will
not
hesitate
to
say
that
to
me
now
---
now
,
when
suffering
have
be
strong
than
all
other
teaching
,
and
have
teach
me
to
understand
what
your
heart
use
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
bent
and
broken
,
but
---
I
hope
---
into
a
well
shape
.
<EOS>
be
as
considerate
and
good
to
me
as
you
be
,
and
tell
me
we
be
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
friend
,
"
say
I
,
rise
and
bend
over
her
,
as
she
rise
from
the
bench
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
will
continue
friend
apart
,
"
say
Estella
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
her
hand
in
mine
,
and
we
go
out
of
the
ruin
place
;
and
,
as
the
morning
mist
have
rise
long
ago
when
I
first
leave
the
forge
,
so
,
the
evening
mist
be
rise
now
,
and
in
all
the
broad
expanse
of
tranquil
light
they
show
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
see
no
shadow
of
another
parting
from
her
.
     
<EOS>
