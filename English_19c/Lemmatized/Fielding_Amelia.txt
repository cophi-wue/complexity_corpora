<EOS>
contain
the
exordium
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
the
various
accident
which
befel
a
very
worthy
couple
after
their
uniting
in
the
state
of
matrimony
will
be
the
subject
of
the
follow
history
.
<EOS>
the
distress
which
they
wade
through
be
some
of
them
<EOS>
so
exquisite
,
and
the
incident
which
produce
these
so
extraordinary
,
that
they
seem
to
require
not
only
the
utmost
malice
,
but
the
utmost
invention
,
which
superstition
hath
ever
attribute
to
Fortune
:
though
whether
any
such
being
interfere
in
the
case
,
or
,
indeed
,
whether
there
be
any
such
being
in
the
universe
,
be
a
matter
which
I
by
no
means
presume
to
determine
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
to
speak
a
bold
truth
,
I
be
,
after
much
mature
deliberation
,
incline
to
suspect
that
the
public
voice
hath
,
in
all
age
,
do
much
injustice
to
Fortune
,
and
hath
convict
her
of
many
fact
in
which
she
have
not
the
least
concern
.
<EOS>
I
question
much
whether
we
may
not
,
by
natural
mean
,
account
for
the
success
of
knave
,
the
calamity
of
fool
,
with
all
the
misery
in
which
man
of
sense
sometimes
involve
themselves
,
by
quit
the
direction
of
Prudence
,
and
follow
the
blind
guidance
of
a
predominant
passion
;
in
short
,
for
all
the
ordinary
phenomenon
which
be
impute
to
Fortune
;
whom
,
perhaps
,
man
accuse
with
no
less
absurdity
in
life
,
than
a
bad
player
complain
of
ill
luck
at
the
game
of
chess
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
man
be
sometimes
guilty
of
lay
improper
blame
on
this
imaginary
being
,
they
be
altogether
as
apt
to
make
her
amend
by
ascribe
to
her
honour
which
she
as
little
deserve
.
<EOS>
to
retrieve
the
ill
consequence
of
a
foolish
conduct
,
and
by
struggle
manfully
with
distress
to
subdue
it
,
be
one
of
the
noble
effort
of
wisdom
and
virtue
.
<EOS>
whoever
,
therefore
,
call
such
a
man
fortunate
,
be
guilty
of
no
less
impropriety
in
speech
than
he
would
be
who
should
call
the
statuary
or
the
poet
fortunate
who
carve
a
Venus
or
who
writ
an
Iliad
.
  
<EOS>
life
may
as
properly
be
call
an
art
as
any
other
;
and
the
great
incident
in
it
be
no
more
to
be
consider
as
mere
accident
than
the
several
member
of
a
fine
statue
or
a
noble
poem
.
<EOS>
the
critic
in
all
these
be
not
content
with
see
anything
to
be
great
without
know
why
and
how
it
come
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
by
examine
carefully
the
several
gradation
which
conduce
to
bring
every
model
to
perfection
,
we
learn
truly
to
know
that
science
in
which
the
model
be
form
:
as
history
of
this
kind
,
therefore
,
may
properly
be
call
model
of
human
life
,
so
,
by
observe
minutely
the
several
incident
which
tend
to
the
catastrophe
or
completion
of
the
whole
,
and
the
minute
cause
whence
those
incident
be
produce
,
we
shall
best
be
instruct
in
this
most
useful
of
all
art
,
which
I
call
the
art
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
the
history
set
out
.
<EOS>
observation
on
the
excellency
of
the
english
constitution
and
curious
examination
before
a
justice
of
peace
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
first
of
April
,
in
the
year
#
#
#
#
,
 
the
watchman
of
a
certain
parish
(
I
know
not
particularly
which
)
within
the
liberty
of
Westminster
bring
several
person
whom
they
have
apprehend
the
precede
night
before
Jonathan
Thrasher
,
Esq
.
,
one
of
the
justice
of
the
peace
for
that
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
but
here
,
reader
,
before
we
proceed
to
the
trial
of
these
offender
,
we
shall
,
after
our
usual
manner
,
premise
some
thing
which
it
may
be
necessary
for
thee
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
It
hath
be
observe
,
I
think
,
by
many
,
as
well
as
the
celebrated
writer
of
three
letter
,
that
no
human
institution
be
capable
of
consummate
perfection
.
<EOS>
an
observation
which
,
perhaps
,
that
writer
at
least
gather
from
discover
some
defect
in
the
polity
even
of
this
well
-
regulate
nation
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
if
there
should
be
any
such
defect
in
a
constitution
which
my
Lord
Coke
long
ago
tell
us
"
the
wisdom
of
all
the
wise
man
in
the
world
,
if
they
have
all
meet
together
at
one
time
,
could
not
have
equal
,
"
which
some
of
our
wise
man
who
be
meet
together
long
before
say
be
too
good
to
be
alter
in
any
particular
,
and
which
,
nevertheless
,
hath
be
mend
ever
since
,
by
a
very
great
number
of
the
say
wise
man
<EOS>
:
if
,
I
say
,
this
constitution
should
be
imperfect
,
we
may
be
allow
,
I
think
,
to
doubt
whether
any
such
faultless
model
can
be
find
among
the
institution
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
probably
be
object
,
that
the
small
imperfection
which
I
be
about
to
produce
do
not
lie
in
the
law
themselves
,
but
in
the
ill
execution
of
them
;
but
,
with
submission
,
this
appear
to
me
to
be
no
less
an
absurdity
than
to
say
of
any
machine
that
it
be
excellently
make
,
though
incapable
of
perform
its
function
.
<EOS>
good
law
should
execute
themselves
in
a
well
-
regulate
state
;
at
least
,
if
the
same
legislature
which
provide
the
law
doth
not
provide
for
the
execution
of
them
,
they
act
as
Graham
would
do
,
if
he
should
form
all
the
part
of
a
clock
in
the
most
exquisite
manner
,
yet
put
them
so
together
that
the
clock
could
not
go
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
,
surely
,
we
may
say
that
there
be
a
small
defect
in
the
constitution
of
the
clock
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
Graham
would
soon
see
the
fault
,
and
would
easily
remedy
it
.
<EOS>
the
fault
,
indeed
,
could
be
no
other
than
that
the
part
be
improperly
dispose
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
,
reader
,
I
have
another
illustration
which
will
set
my
intention
in
still
a
clear
light
before
you
.
<EOS>
figure
to
yourself
<EOS>
then
a
family
,
the
master
of
which
should
dispose
of
the
several
economical
office
in
the
follow
manner
;
viz
.
<EOS>
should
put
his
butler
in
the
coach
-
box
,
his
steward
behind
his
coach
,
his
coachman
in
the
butlery
,
and
his
footman
in
the
stewardship
,
and
in
the
same
ridiculous
manner
should
misemploy
the
talent
of
every
other
servant
;
it
be
easy
to
see
what
a
figure
such
a
family
must
make
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
as
ridiculous
as
this
may
seem
,
I
have
often
consider
some
of
the
low
officer
in
our
civil
government
to
be
dispose
in
this
very
manner
.
<EOS>
to
begin
,
I
think
,
as
low
as
I
well
can
,
with
the
watchman
in
our
metropolis
,
who
,
be
to
guard
our
street
by
night
from
thief
and
robber
,
an
office
which
at
least
require
strength
of
body
,
be
choose
out
of
those
poor
old
decrepit
people
who
be
,
from
their
want
of
bodily
strength
,
render
incapable
of
get
a
livelihood
by
work
.
<EOS>
these
man
,
arm
only
with
a
pole
,
which
some
of
them
be
scarce
able
to
lift
,
be
to
secure
the
person
and
house
of
his
majesty
's
subject
from
the
attack
of
gang
of
young
,
bold
,
stout
,
desperate
,
and
well
-
arm
villain
.
       
<EOS>
Quae
non
viribus
istis
     
Munera
conveniunt
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
poor
old
fellow
should
run
away
from
such
enemy
,
no
one
I
think
can
wonder
,
unless
it
be
that
they
be
able
to
make
their
escape
.
  
<EOS>
the
high
we
proceed
among
our
public
officer
and
magistrate
,
the
less
defect
of
this
kind
will
,
perhaps
,
be
observable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Thrasher
,
however
,
the
justice
before
whom
the
prisoner
above
mention
be
now
bring
,
have
some
few
imperfection
in
his
magistratical
capacity
.
<EOS>
I
own
,
I
have
be
sometimes
incline
to
think
that
this
office
of
a
justice
of
peace
require
some
knowledge
of
the
law
:
for
this
simple
reason
;
because
,
in
every
case
which
come
before
him
,
he
be
to
judge
and
act
accord
to
law
.
<EOS>
again
,
as
these
law
be
contain
in
a
great
variety
of
book
,
the
statute
which
relate
to
the
office
of
a
justice
of
peace
make
of
themselves
at
least
two
large
volume
in
folio
;
and
that
part
of
his
jurisdiction
which
be
found
on
the
common
law
be
disperse
in
above
a
hundred
volume
,
I
can
not
conceive
how
this
knowledge
should
by
acquire
without
read
;
and
yet
certain
it
be
,
Mr.
Thrasher
never
read
one
syllable
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
perhaps
,
be
a
defect
;
but
this
be
not
all
:
for
where
mere
ignorance
be
to
decide
a
point
between
two
litigant
,
it
will
always
be
an
even
chance
whether
it
decide
right
or
wrong
:
but
sorry
be
<EOS>
I
to
say
,
right
be
often
in
a
much
bad
situation
than
this
,
and
wrong
hath
often
have
five
hundred
to
one
on
his
side
before
that
magistrate
;
who
,
if
he
be
ignorant
of
the
law
of
England
,
be
yet
well
verse
in
the
law
of
nature
.
<EOS>
He
perfectly
well
understand
that
fundamental
principle
so
strongly
lay
down
in
the
institute
of
the
learn
Rochefoucault
,
by
which
the
duty
of
self
-
love
be
so
strongly
enforce
,
and
every
man
be
teach
to
consider
himself
as
the
centre
of
gravity
,
and
to
attract
all
thing
thither
.
<EOS>
to
speak
the
truth
plainly
,
the
justice
be
never
indifferent
in
a
cause
<EOS>
but
when
he
could
get
nothing
on
either
side
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
justice
to
whose
tremendous
bar
<EOS>
Mr.
gotobe
the
constable
,
on
the
day
above
mention
,
bring
several
delinquent
,
who
,
as
we
have
say
,
have
be
apprehend
by
the
watch
for
diverse
outrage
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
who
come
upon
his
trial
be
as
bloody
a
spectre
as
ever
the
imagination
of
a
murderer
or
a
tragic
poet
conceive
.
<EOS>
this
poor
wretch
be
charge
with
a
battery
by
a
much
stouter
man
than
himself
;
indeed
the
accuse
person
bore
about
him
some
evidence
that
he
have
be
in
an
affray
,
his
cloath
be
very
bloody
,
but
certain
open
sluice
on
his
own
head
sufficiently
shew
whence
all
the
scarlet
stream
have
issue
:
whereas
the
accuser
have
not
the
least
mark
or
appearance
of
any
wound
.
<EOS>
the
justice
ask
the
defendant
,
what
he
mean
by
break
the
king
's
peace
?
 
<EOS>
to
which
he
answer
"
upon
my
shoul
I
do
love
the
king
very
well
,
and
I
have
not
be
after
break
anything
of
his
that
I
do
know
;
but
upon
my
shoul
this
man
hath
brake
my
head
,
and
my
head
do
brake
his
stick
;
that
be
all
,
gra
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
offer
to
produce
several
witness
against
this
improbable
accusation
;
but
the
justice
presently
interrupt
him
,
say
,
"
Sirrah
,
your
tongue
betray
your
guilt
.
<EOS>
You
be
an
Irishman
,
and
that
be
always
sufficient
evidence
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
second
criminal
be
a
poor
woman
,
who
be
take
up
by
the
watch
as
a
street
-
walker
.
<EOS>
It
be
allege
against
her
that
she
be
find
walk
the
street
after
twelve
o'clock
,
and
the
watchman
declare
he
believe
her
to
be
a
common
strumpet
.
<EOS>
She
plead
in
her
defence
(
as
be
really
the
truth
)
<EOS>
that
she
be
a
servant
,
and
be
send
by
her
mistress
,
who
be
a
little
shopkeeper
and
upon
the
point
of
delivery
,
to
fetch
a
midwife
;
which
she
offer
to
prove
by
several
of
the
neighbour
,
if
she
be
allow
to
send
for
them
.
<EOS>
the
justice
ask
her
why
she
have
not
do
it
before
?
<EOS>
to
which
she
answer
,
she
have
no
money
,
and
could
get
no
messenger
.
<EOS>
the
justice
then
call
her
several
scurrilous
name
,
and
,
declare
she
be
guilty
within
the
statute
of
street
-
walking
,
order
her
to
Bridewell
for
a
month
.
  
<EOS>
a
genteel
young
man
and
woman
be
then
set
forward
,
and
a
very
grave
-
looking
person
swear
he
catch
them
in
a
situation
which
we
can
not
as
particularly
describe
here
as
he
do
before
the
magistrate
;
who
,
have
receive
a
wink
from
his
clerk
,
declare
with
much
warmth
that
the
fact
be
incredible
and
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
presently
discharge
the
accuse
party
,
and
be
go
,
without
any
evidence
,
to
commit
the
accuser
for
perjury
;
but
this
the
clerk
dissuade
him
from
,
say
he
doubt
whether
a
justice
of
peace
have
any
such
power
.
<EOS>
the
justice
at
first
differ
in
opinion
,
and
say
,
"
He
have
see
a
man
stand
in
the
pillory
about
perjury
;
nay
,
he
have
know
a
man
in
gaol
for
it
too
;
and
how
come
he
there
if
he
be
not
commit
thither
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
be
true
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
clerk
;
"
and
yet
I
have
be
tell
by
a
very
great
lawyer
that
a
man
can
not
be
commit
for
perjury
before
he
be
indict
;
and
the
reason
be
,
I
believe
,
because
it
be
not
against
the
peace
before
the
indictment
make
it
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
may
be
,
"
cry
the
justice
,
"
and
indeed
perjury
be
but
scandalous
word
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
a
man
can
not
have
no
warrant
for
those
,
unless
you
put
for
rioting

at

at

<EOS>
though
the
bare
word
of
an
offender
can
never
be
take
against
the
oath
of
his
accuser

yet
the
matter
of

be
so
pertinent

and
deliver
with
such
an
air
of
truth

sincerity

that
,
have
the
magistrate
be
endue
with
much
sagacity
,
or
have
he
be
very
moderately
gift
with
another
quality
very
necessary
to
all
who
be
to
administer
justice
,
he
would
have
employ
some
labour
in
cross
-
examine
the
watchman

at

he
would
have
give
the
defendant
the
time
he
desire
to
send
for
the
other
person
who
be
present
at
the
affray
;
neither
of
which
he

<EOS>
in
short
,
the
magistrate
have
too
great
an
honour
for
truth
to
suspect
that
she
ever
appear
in
sordid
apparel

nor
do
he

sublime
notion

idea

poverty

distress

<EOS>
there
remain
now
only
one
prisoner

<EOS>
His
trial

<EOS>
a
cause
of
battery
and
break
lanthorn
be
institute
against
him
,
and
prove
in
the

manner
;
nor
would
the
justice
hear
one
word
in
defence
;
but
,
though
his
patience
be
exhaust
,
his
breath
be
not
;
for
against
this
last
wretch
he
pour
forth
a
great
many
volley
of
menace
and
abuse
.
  
<EOS>
the
delinquent
be
then
all
dispatch
to
prison
under
a
guard
of
watchmen
,
and
the
justice
and
the

adjourn
to
a
neighbouring
alehouse
to
take
their
morning
repast

<EOS>
Mr.

(
for
we

you
with
the
rest
)
be
no
sooner
arrive
in
the
prison
than
a
number
of
person
gather
round
him
,
all
demand
garnish
;
to
which
Mr.
Booth
not
make
a
ready
answer
,
as
indeed
he
do
not
understand
the
word
,
some
be
go
to
lay
hold
of
him
,
when
a
person
of
apparent
dignity
come
up
and
insist
that
no
one
should
affront
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
this
person
then
,
who
be
no
less
than
the
master
or
keeper
of
the
prison
,
turn
towards
Mr.
Booth
,
acquaint
him
that
it
be
the
custom
of
the
place
for
every
prisoner
upon
his
first
arrival
there
to
give
something
to
the
former
prisoner
to
make
them
drink
.
<EOS>
this
,
he
say
,
be
what
they
call
garnish
,
and
conclude
with
advise
his
new
customer
to
draw
his
purse
upon
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
answer
that
he
would
very
readily
comply
with
this
laudable
custom
,
be
it
in
his
power
;
but
that
in
reality
he
have
not
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
,
and
,
what
be
bad
,
he
have
not
a
shilling
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
<EOS>
if
that
be
the
case
,
"
cry
the
keeper
,
"
it
be
another
matter
,
and
I
have
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
upon
which
he
immediately
depart
,
and
leave
poor
Booth
to
the
mercy
of
his
companion
,
who
without
loss
of
time
apply
themselves
to
uncase
,
as
they
term
it
,
and
with
such
dexterity
,
that
his
coat
be
not
only
stript
off
,
but
out
of
sight
in
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
be
too
weak
to
resist
and
too
wise
to
complain
of
this
usage
.
<EOS>
as
soon
,
therefore
,
as
he
be
at
liberty
,
and
declare
free
of
the
place
,
he
summon
his
philosophy
,
of
which
he
have
no
inconsiderable
share
,
to
his
assistance
,
and
resolve
to
make
himself
as
easy
as
possible
under
his
present
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
Could
his
own
thought
indeed
have
suffer
him
a
moment
to
forget
where
he
be
,
the
disposition
of
the
other
prisoner
may
have
induce
him
to
believe
that
he
have
be
in
a
happy
place
:
for
much
the
great
part
of
his
fellow
-
sufferer
,
instead
of
wail
and
repine
at
their
condition
,
be
laugh
,
singe
,
and
divert
themselves
with
various
kind
of
sport
and
gambol
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
person
v
/
ho
accost
him
be
call
Blear
-
eyed
Moll
,
a
woman
of
no
very
comely
appearance
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
(
for
she
have
but
one
)
,
whence
she
derive
her
nickname
,
be
such
as
that
nickname
bespoke
;
besides
which
,
it
have
two
remarkable
quality
;
for
first
,
as
if
Nature
have
be
careful
to
provide
for
her
own
defect
,
it
constantly
look
towards
her
blind
side
;
and
secondly
,
the
ball
consist
almost
entirely
of
white
,
or
rather
yellow
,
with
a
little
grey
spot
in
the
corner
,
so
small
that
it
be
scarce
discernible
.
<EOS>
nose
<EOS>
she
have
none
;
for
Venus
,
envious
perhaps
at
her
former
charm
,
have
carry
off
the
gristly
part
;
and
some
earthly
damsel
,
perhaps
,
from
the
same
envy
,
have
level
the
bone
with
the
rest
of
her
face
:
indeed
it
be
far
beneath
the
bone
of
her
cheek
,
which
rise
proportionally
high
than
be
usual
.
<EOS>
about
half
a
dozen
ebony
tooth
fortify
that
large
and
long
canal
which
nature
have
cut
from
ear
to
ear
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
be
a
chin
preposterously
short
,
nature
have
turn
up
the
bottom
,
instead
of
suffer
it
to
grow
to
its
due
length
.
  
<EOS>
Her
body
be
well
adapt
to
her
face
;
she
measure
full
as
much
round
the
middle
as
from
head
to
foot
;
for
,
besides
the
extreme
breadth
of
her
back
,
her
vast
breast
have
long
since
forsake
their
native
home
,
and
have
settle
themselves
a
little
below
the
girdle
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
certain
actress
on
the
stage
,
when
they
be
to
perform
character
of
no
amiable
cast
,
would
study
to
dress
themselves
with
the
propriety
with
which
Blear
-
eyed
Moll
be
now
array
.
<EOS>
for
the
sake
of
our
squeamish
reader
,
we
shall
not
descend
to
particular
;
let
it
suffice
to
say
,
nothing
more
ragged
or
more
dirty
be
ever
empty
out
of
the
round
-
house
at
St
Giles
's
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
take
the
more
pain
to
describe
this
person
,
for
two
remarkable
reason
;
the
one
be
,
that
this
unlovely
creature
be
take
in
the
fact
with
a
very
pretty
young
fellow
;
the
other
,
which
be
more
productive
of
moral
lesson
,
be
,
that
however
wretche
her
fortune
may
appear
to
the
reader
<EOS>
,
she
be
one
of
the
merry
person
in
the
whole
prison
.
  
<EOS>
Blear
-
eyed
Moll
then
come
up
to
Mr.
Booth
with
a
smile
,
or
rather
grin
,
on
her
countenance
,
and
ask
him
for
a
dram
of
gin
;
and
when
Booth
assure
her
that
he
have
not
a
penny
of
money
,
she
reply
 
"
D####n
<EOS>
your
eye
<EOS>
,
I
think
by
your
look
you
have
be
a
clever
fellow
,
and
upon
the
snaffle
lay
[

at

you

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
launch
forth
a
volley
of
dreadful
oath
,
interlard
with
some
language
not
proper
to
be
repeat
here
,
and
be
go
to
lay
hold
on
poor
Booth
,
when
a
tall
prisoner
,
who
have
be
very
earnestly
eye
Booth
for
some
time
,
come
up
,
and
,
take
her
by
the
shoulder
,
fling
her
off
at
some
distance
,
curse
her
for
a
b####h
,
and
bid
her
<EOS>
let
the
gentleman
alone
.
  
<EOS>
this
person
be
not
himself
of
the
most
inviting
aspect
.
<EOS>
He
be
long
-
visaged
,
and
pale
,
with
a
red
beard
of
above
a
fortnight
's
growth
.
<EOS>
He
be
attire
in
a
brownish
-
black
coat
,
which
would
have
shew
more
hole
than
it
do
,
have
not
the
linen
,
which
appear
through
it
,
be
entirely
of
the
same
colour
with
the
cloth
.
  
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
whose
name
be
Robinson
,
address
himself
very
civilly
to
Mr.
Booth
,
and
tell
him
he
be
sorry
to
see
one
of
his
appearance
in
that
place
:
"
<EOS>
for
as
to
your
being
without
your
coat
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
can
easily
account
for
that
;
and
,
indeed
,
dress
be
the
least
part
which
distinguish
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
at
which
word
he
cast
a
significant
look
on
his
own
coat
,
as
if
he
desire
they
should
be
apply
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
in
the
follow
manner
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
,
sir
,
you
be
but
just
arrive
in
this
dismal
place
,
which
be
,
indeed
,
render
more
detestable
by
the
wretch
who
inhabit
it
than
by
any
other
circumstance
;
but
even
these
a
wise
man
will
soon
bring
himself
to
bear
with
indifference
;
for
what
be
,
be
;
and
what
must
be
,
must
be
.
<EOS>
the
knowledge
of
this
,
which
,
simple
as
it
appear
,
be
in
truth
the
heighth
of
all
philosophy
,
render
a
wise
man
superior
to
every
evil
which
can
befall
him
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
sir
,
no
very
dreadful
accident
be
the
cause
of
your
come
hither
;
but
,
whatever
it
be
,
you
may
be
assure
it
could
not
be
otherwise
;
for
all
thing
happen
by
an
inevitable
fatality
;
and
a
man
can
no
more
resist
the
impulse
of
fate
than
a
wheelbarrow
<EOS>
can
the
force
of
its
driver
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
besides
the
obligation
which
Mr.
Robinson
have
confer
on
Mr.
Booth
in
deliver
him
from
the
insult
of
Blear
-
eyed
Moll
,
there
be
something
in
the
manner
of
Robinson
which
,
notwithstanding
the
meanness
of
his
dress
,
seem
to
distinguish
him
from
the
crowd
of
wretch
who
swarm
in
those
region
;
and
,
above
all
,
the
sentiment
which
he
have
just
declare
very
nearly
coincide
with
those
of
Mr.
Booth
:
this
gentleman
be
what
they
call
a
freethinker
;
that
be
to
say
,
a
deist
,
or
,
perhaps
,
an
atheist
;
for
,
though
he
do
not
absolutely
deny
the
existence
of
a
God
,
yet
he
entirely
deny
his
providence
.
<EOS>
a
doctrine
which
,
if
it
be
not
downright
atheism
,
hath
a
direct
tendency
towards
it
;
and
,
as
Dr
Clarke
observe
,
may
soon
be
drive
into
it
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
Mr.
Booth
,
though
he
be
in
his
heart
an
extreme
well
-
wisher
to
religion
(
for
he
be
an
honest
man
)
,
yet
his
notion
of
it
be
very
slight
and
uncertain
.
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
he
be
in
the
wavering
condition
so
finely
describe
by
Claudian
:
                            
<EOS>
labefacta

<EOS>
this
way
of
thinking
,
or
rather
of
doubt
,
he
have
contract
from
the
same
reason
which
claudian
assign
,
and
which
have
induce
Brutus
in
his
latter
day
to
doubt
the
existence
of
that
virtue
which
he
have
all
his
life
cultivate
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
poor
Booth
imagine
that
a
large
share
of
misfortune
have
fall
to
his
lot
than
he
have
merit
;
and
this
lead
him
,
who
(
though
a
good
classical
scholar
)
be
not
deeply
learn
in
religious
matter
,
into
a
disadvantageous
opinion
of
Providence
.
<EOS>
a
dangerous
way
of
reasoning
,
in
which
our
conclusion
be
not
only
too
hasty
,
from
an
imperfect
view
of
thing
,
but
we
be
likewise
liable
to
much
error
from
partiality
to
ourselves
;
view
our
virtue
and
vice
as
through
a
perspective
,
in
which
we
turn
the
glass
always
to
our
own
advantage
,
so
as
to
diminish
the
one
,
and
as
greatly
to
magnify
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
above
reason
,
it
can
be
no
wonder
that
Mr.
Booth
do
not
decline
the
acquaintance
of
this
person
,
in
a
place
which
could
not
promise
to
afford
him
any
better
.
<EOS>
He
answer
him
,
therefore
,
with
great
courtesy
,
as
indeed
he
be
of
a
very
good
and
gentle
disposition
,
and
,
after
express
a
civil
surprize
at
meet
him
there
,
declare
himself
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
with
regard
to
the
necessity
of
human
action
;
add
,
however
,
that
he
do
not
believe
man
be
under
any
blind
impulse
or
direction
of
fate
,
but
that
every
man
act
merely
from
the
force
of
that
passion
which
be
uppermost
in
his
mind
,
and
could
do
no
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
a
discourse
now
ensue
between
the
two
gentleman
on
the
necessity
arise
from
the
impulse
of
fate
,
and
the
necessity
arise
from
the
impulse
of
passion
,
which
,
as
it
will
make
a
pretty
pamphlet
of
itself
,
we
shall
reserve
for
some
future
opportunity
.
<EOS>
when
this
be
end
they
set
forward
to
survey
the
gaol
and
the
prisoner
,
with
the
several
case
of
whom
Mr.
Robinson
,
who
have
be
some
time
under
confinement
,
undertake
to
make
Mr.
Booth
acquaint
.
    
<EOS>
disclose
further
secret
of
the
prison
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
person
whom
they
pass
by
be
three
man
in
fetter
,
who
be
enjoy
themselves
very
merrily
over
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
pipe
of
tobacco
.
<EOS>
these
,
Mr.
Robinson
inform
his
friend
,
be
three
street
-
robber
,
and
be
all
certain
of
be
hang
the
ensue
session
.
<EOS>
so
inconsiderable
an
object
,
say
he
,
be
misery
to
light
mind
,
when
it
be
at
any
distance
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
farther
they
beheld
a
man
prostrate
on
the
ground
,
whose
heavy
groan
and
frantic
action
plainly
indicate
the
high
disorder
of
mind
.
<EOS>
this
person
be
,
it
seem
,
commit
for
a
small
felony
;
and
<EOS>
his
wife
,
who
then
lie
-
in
,
upon
hear
the
news
,
have
throw
herself
from
a
window
two
pair
of
stair
high
,
by
which
mean
he
have
,
in
all
probability
,
lose
both
her
and
his
child
.
  
<EOS>
a
very
pretty
girl
then
advance
towards
them
,
whose
beauty
Mr.
Booth
could
not
help
admire
the
moment
he
see
her
;
declare
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
think
she
have
great
innocence
in
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
Robinson
say
she
be
commit
thither
as
an
idle
and
disorderly
person
,
and
a
common
street
-
walker
.
<EOS>
as
she
past
by
Mr.
Booth
,
she
damn
his
eye
,
and
discharge
a
volley
of
word
,
every
one
of
which
be
too
indecent
to
be
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
They
now
beheld
a
little
creature
sit
by
herself
in
a
corner
,
and
cry
bitterly
.
<EOS>
this
girl
,
Mr.
Robinson
say
,
be
commit
because
her
father
-
in
-
law
,
who
be
in
the
grenadier
guard
,
have
swear
that
he
be
afraid
of
his
life
,
or
of
some
bodily
harm
which
she
would
do
him
,
and
she
could
get
no
surety
for
keep
the
peace
;
for
which
reason
justice
Thrasher
have
commit
her
to
prison
.
  
<EOS>
a
great
noise
now
arise
,
occasion
by
the
prisoner
all
flock
to
see
a
fellow
whipt
for
petty
larceny
,
to
which
he
be
condemn
by
the
court
of
quarter
-
session
;
but
this
soon
end
in
the
disappointment
of
the
spectator
;
for
the
fellow
,
after
be
stript
,
have
advance
another
sixpence
,
be
discharge
untouched
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
immediately
follow
by
another
bustle
;
Blear
-
eyed
Moll
,
and
several
of
her
companion
,
have
get
possession
of
a
man
who
be
commit
for
certain
odious
unmanlike
practice
,
not
fit
to
be
name
,
be
give
him
various
kind
of
discipline
,
and
would
probably
have
put
an
end
to
him
,
have
he
not
be
rescue
out
of
their
hand
by
authority
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
bustle
be
a
little
allay
,
Mr.
Booth
take
notice
of
a
young
woman
in
rag
sit
on
the
ground
,
and
support
the
head
of
an
old
man
in
her
lap
,
who
appear
to
be
give
up
the
ghost
.
<EOS>
these

Mr.
Robinson
inform
him

be
father
and
daughter
;
that
the
latter
be

a
loaf
,
in

to

<EOS>
a

then
walk
surlily
by
them
,
whom
Mr.
Robinson
report
to
have
be
commit
on
an
indictment
find
against
him
for
a
most
horrid
perjury
;
but
,
say
he
,
we
expect
him
to
be
bail
today
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Booth
,
"
can
such
villain
find
bail
,
and
be
no
person
charitable
enough
to
bail
that
poor
father
and
daughter
?
"
<EOS>
"
oh
!
sir
,
"
answer
Robinson
,
"
the
offence
of
the
daughter
,
be
felony
,
be
hold
not
to
be
bailable
in
law
;
whereas
perjury
be
a
misdemeanor
only
;
and
therefore
person
who
be
even
indict
for
it
be
,
nevertheless
,
capable
of
be
bail
.
<EOS>
nay
,
of
all
perjury
,
that
of
which
this
man
be
indict
be
the
bad
;
for
it
be
with
an
intention
of
take
away
the
life
of
an
innocent
person
by
form
of
law
.
<EOS>
as
to
perjury
in
civil
matter
,
they
be
not
so
very
criminal
.
"
<EOS>
"
They
be
not
,
"
say
Booth
;
"
and
yet
even
these
be
a
most
flagitious
offence
,
and
worthy
the
high
punishment
.
"
<EOS>
"
surely
they
ought
to
be
distinguish
,
"
answer
Robinson
,
"
from
the
other
:
for
what
be
take
away
a
little
property
from
a
man
,
compare
to
take
away
his
life
and
his
reputation
,
and
ruin
his
family
into
the
bargain
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
there
can
be
no
comparison
in
the
crime
,
and
I
think
there
ought
to
be
none
in
the
punishment
.
<EOS>
however
,
at
present
,
the
punishment
of
all
perjury
be
only
pillory
and
transportation
for
seven
year
;
and
,
as
it
be
a
traversable
and
bailable
offence
,
method
be
find
to
escape
any
punishment
at
all
.

"[Footnote

exprest
great
astonishment
at
this

his
attention
be
suddenly
divert
by
the
most
miserable
object
that
he
have
yet

<EOS>
this
be
a
wretch
almost
naked

join
to
an

He
have

moreover

a

two

hath
serve

his

several

he
come
over
to

day
apprehend

here
he

<EOS>

Booth
exprest
great
horror
at
this
account

and
declare
,
if
he
have
only
so
much
money
in
his
pocket

he
would
pay
his

add
that

Robinson
hesitate
a
moment

then

with
a
smile
,
"
I
be
go
to
make
you

Booth

agree
to
this
;
for
,
though
some
love
of

amongst
his

run
on

have
,
as

search
him
to
the
bottom

in

he
have
thoroughly
examine
every

convey
away
a
penknife

which

stand
near

introduce

He
view

very
attentively

know
her

be
indeed
so
remarkably
handsome

it

that
she
be
commit
for
murder

<EOS>
the
latter
part
of
this
information
make
Mr.

suspect
his
memory
more
than
the
former
;
for
it
be
very
possible
that
she
may
have
change
her
name
;
but
he
hardly
think
she
could
so
far
have
change
her
nature
as
to
be
guilty
of
a
crime
so
very
incongruous
with
her
former
gentle
manner

for
Miss
Matthews
have
both
the
birth
and
education
of
a
gentlewoman

conclude

certainly
mistaken

rest
satisfied

contain

Mr.

the

spend

melancholy
contemplation

He
be
destitute
of
the
common
necessary
of
life

consequently
unable
to
subsist
where
he
be
;
nor
be
there
a
single
person
in
town
to
whom
he
could
,
with
any
reasonable
hope
,
apply
for
his
delivery

<EOS>
grief
for
some
time
banish
the
thought
of
food
from
his
mind
;
but
in
the
morning
nature
begin
to
grow
uneasy
for
want
of
her
usual
nourishment
:
for
he
have
not
eat
a
morsel
during
the
last
forty
hour
.
<EOS>
a
penny
loaf
,
which
be
,
it
seem
,
the
ordinary
allowance
to
the
prisoner
in
Bridewell
,
be
now
deliver
him
;
and
while
he
be
eat
this
a
man
bring
him
a
little
packet
seal
up
,
inform
him
that
it
come
by
a
messenger
,
who
say
it
require
no
answer

<EOS>
Mr.

now
open
his
packet
,
and
,
after
unfold
several
piece
of
blank
paper
successively
,
at
last
discover
a
guinea
,
wrapt
with
great
care
in
the
inmost
paper
.
<EOS>
He
be
vastly
surprize
at
this
sight
,
as
he
have
few
if
any
friend
from
whom
he
could
expect
such
a
favour
,
slight
as
it
be
;
and
not
one
of
his
friend
,
as
he
be
apprize
,
know
of
his
confinement

<EOS>
as
there
be
no
direction
to
the
packet
,
nor
a
word
of
writing
contain
in
it
,
he
begin
to
suspect
that
it
be
deliver
to
the
wrong
person
;
and
be
one
of
the
most
untainted
honesty
,
he
find
out
the
man
who
give
it
him
,
and
again
examine
him
concern
the
person
who
bring
it
,
and
the
message
deliver
with
it
.
<EOS>
the
man
assure
Booth
that
he
have
make
no
mistake
;
say
,
"
if
your
name
be
Booth
,
sir
,
I
be
positive
you
be
the
gentleman
to
whom
the
parcel
I
give
you
belong
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
most
scrupulous
honesty
would
,
perhaps
,
in
such
a
situation
,
have
be
well
enough
satisfied
in
find
no
owner
for
the
guinea
;
especially
when
proclamation
have
be
make
in
the
prison
that
Mr.
Booth
have
receive
a
packet
without
any
direction
,
to
which
,
if
any
person
have
any
claim
,
and
would
discover
the
content
,
he
be
ready
to
deliver
it
to
such
claimant
.
<EOS>
no
such
claimant
be
find
(
I
mean
none
who
know
the
content
;
for
many
swore
that
they
expect
just
such
a
packet
,
and
believe
it
to
be
their
property
)
,
Mr.
Booth
very
calmly
resolve
to
apply
the
money
to
his
own
use
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
after
redemption
of
the
coat
,
which
Mr.
Booth
,
hungry
as
he
be
,
think
of
,
be
to
supply
himself
with
snuff
,
which
he
have
long
,
to
his
great
sorrow
,
be
without
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
he
presently
miss
that
iron
box
which
the
methodist
have
so
dexterously
convey
out
of
his
pocket
,
as
we
mention
in
the
last
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
miss
this
box
than
he
immediately
suspect
that
the
gambler
be
the
person
who
have
steal
it
;
nay
,
so
well
be
he
assure
of
this
man
's
guilt
,
that
it
may
,
perhaps
,
be
improper
to
say
he
barely
suspect
it
.
<EOS>
though
Mr.
Booth
be
,
as
we
have
hint
,
a
man
of
a
very
sweet
disposition
,
yet
be
he
rather
overwarm
.
<EOS>
have
,
therefore
,
no
doubt
concern
the
person
of
the
thief
,
he
eagerly
seek
him
out
,
and
very
bluntly
charge
him
with
the
fact
.
  
<EOS>
the
gambler
,
whom
I
think
we
should
now
call
the
philosopher
,
receive
this
charge
without
the
least
visible
emotion
either
of
mind
or
muscle
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
of
a
few
moment
,
he
answer
,
with
great
solemnity
,
as
follow
:
"
young
man
,
I
be
entirely
unconcerned
at
your
groundless
suspicion
.
<EOS>
He
that
censure
a
stranger
,
as
I
be
to
you
,
without
any
cause
,
make
a
bad
compliment
to
himself
than
to
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
You
know
yourself
,
friend
;
you
know
not
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
you
hear
me
accuse
of
be
a
cheat
and
a
gamester
;
but
who
be
my
accuser
?
<EOS>
look
at
my
apparel
,
friend
;
do
thief
and
gamester
wear
such
cloath
as
these
?
<EOS>
play
be
my
folly
,
not
my
vice
;
it
be
my
impulse
,
and
I
have
be
a
martyr
to
it
.
<EOS>
Would
a
gamester
have
ask
another
to
play
when
he
could
have
lose
eighteen
-
penny
and
win
nothing
?
<EOS>
however
,
if
you
be
not
satisfied
,
you
may
search
my
pocket
;
the
outside
of
all
but
one
will
serve
your
turn
,
and
in
that
one
there
be
the
eighteen
-
penny
I
tell
you
of
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
turn
up
his
cloath
;
and
his
pocket
entirely
resemble
the
pitcher
of
the
Belides
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
a
little
staggered
at
this
defence
.
<EOS>
He
say
the
real
value
of
the
iron
box
be
too
inconsiderable
to
mention
;
but
that
he
have
a
capricious
value
for
it
,
for
the
sake
of
the
person
who
give
it
him
;
"
for
,
though
it
be
not
,
"
say
he
,
"
worth
sixpence
,
I
would
willingly
give
a
crown
to
any
one
who
would
bring
it
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Robinson
answer
,
"
if
that
be
the
case
,
you
have
nothing
more
to
do
but
to
signify
your
intention
in
the
prison
,
and
I
be
well
convinced
you
will
not
be
long
without
regain
the
possession
of
your
snuff-
box
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
advice
be
immediately
follow
,
and
with
success
,
the
methodist
presently
produce
the
box
,
which
,
he
say
,
he
have
find
,
and
should
have
return
it
before
,
have
he
know
the
person
to
whom
it
belong
;
add
,
with
uplifted
eye
,
that
the
spirit
would
not
suffer
him
knowingly
to
detain
the
good
of
another
,
however
inconsiderable
the
value
be
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
so
,
friend
?
"
say
Robinson
.
<EOS>
"
have
I
not
hear
you
often
say
,
the
wickeder
any
man
be
the
well
,
provide
he
be
what
you
call
a
believer
?
"
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
me
,
"
cry
Cooper
(
for
that
be
the
name
of
the
methodist
)
:
<EOS>
"
no
man
can
be
wicked
after
he
be
possess
by
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
wide
difference
between
the
day
of
sin
and
the
day
of
grace
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
sinner
myself
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
believe
thee
,
"
cry
Robinson
,
with
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
,
"
answer
the
other
,
"
what
an
atheist
believe
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
would
insinuate
that
I
steal
the
snuff
-
box
;
but
I
value
not
your
malice
;
the
Lord
know
my
innocence
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
walk
off
with
the
reward
;
and
Booth
,
turn
to
Robinson
,
very
earnestly
ask
pardon
for
his
groundless
suspicion
;
which
the
other
,
without
any
hesitation
,
accord
him
,
say
,
"
You
never
accuse
me
,
sir
;
you
suspect
some
gambler
,
with
whose
character
I
have
no
concern
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
angry
with
a
friend
or
acquaintance
who
should
give
a
hasty
credit
to
any
allegation
against
me
;
but
I
have
no
reason
to
be
offend
with
you
for
believe
what
the
woman
,
and
the
rascal
who
be
just
go
,
and
who
be
commit
here
for
a
pickpocket
,
which
you
do
not
perhaps
know
,
tell
you
to
my
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
and
if
you
think
me
to
be
a
gambler
you
have
just
reason
to
suspect
any
ill
of
me
;
for
I
myself
be
confine
here
by
the
perjury
of
one
of
those
villain
,
who
,
have
cheat
me
of
my
money
at
play
,
and
hear
that
I
intend
to
apply
to
a
magistrate
against
him
,
himself
begin
the
attack
,
and
obtain
a
warrant
against
me
of
Justice
Thrasher
,
who
,
without
hear
one
speech
in
my
defence
,
commit
me
to
this
place
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
testify
great
compassion
at
this
account
;
and
,
he
have
invite
Robinson
to
dinner
,
they
spend
that
day
together
.
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
Booth
indulge
his
friend
with
a
game
at
card
;
at
first
for
halfpence
and
afterwards
for
shilling
,
when
fortune
so
favour
Robinson
that
he
do
not
leave
the
other
a
single
shilling
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
a
surprizing
run
of
luck
in
a
gamester
be
often
mistaken
for
somewhat
else
by
person
who
be
not
over
-
zealous
believer
in
the
divinity
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
stranger
at
Bath
,
who
hath
happen
fortunately
(
I
may
almost
say
unfortunately
)
to
have
four
by
honour
in
his
hand
almost
every
time
he
deal
for
a
whole
evening
,
shun
universally
by
the
whole
company
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
and
certain
it
be
,
that
Mr.
Booth
,
though
of
a
temper
very
little
inclined
to
suspicion
,
begin
to
waver
in
his
opinion
whether
the
character
give
by
Mr.
Robinson
of
himself
,
or
that
which
the
other
give
of
him
,
be
the
truer
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning
hunger
pay
him
a
second
visit
,
and
find
him
again
in
the
same
situation
as
before
.
<EOS>
after
some
deliberation
,
therefore
,
he
resolve
to
ask
Robinson
to
lend
him
a
shilling
or
two
of
that
money
which
be
lately
his
own
.
<EOS>
and
this
experiment
he
think
,
would
confirm
him
either
in
a
good
or
evil
opinion
of
that
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
demand
<EOS>
Robinson
answer
,
with
great
alacrity
,
that
he
should
very
gladly
have
comply
,
have
not
fortune
play
one
of
her
jade
trick
with
him
:
"
for
since
my
winning
of
you
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
be
stript
not
only
of
your
money
but
my
own
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
harangue
farther
;
but
Booth
,
with
great
indignation
,
turn
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
poor
gentleman
have
very
little
time
to
reflect
on
his
own
misery
,
or
the
rascality
,
as
it
appear
to
him
,
of
the
other
,
when
the
same
person
who
have
the
day
before
deliver
him
the
guinea
from
the
unknown
hand
,
again
accost
him
,
and
tell
him
a
lady
in
the
house
(
so
he
express
himself
)
desire
the
favour
of
his
company
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
immediately
obey
the
message
,
and
be
conduct
into
a
room
in
the
prison
,
where
he
be
presently
convince
that
Mrs.
Vincent
be
no
other
than
his
old
acquaintance
Miss
Matthews
.
    
<EOS>
contain
the
extraordinary
behaviour
of
Miss
Matthews
on
her
meeting
with
Booth
,
and
some
endeavour
to
prove
,
by
reason
and
authority
,
that
it
be
possible
for
a
woman
to
appear
to
be
what
she
really
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
eight
or
nine
year
have
past
since
any
interview
between
Mr.
Booth
and
Miss
Matthews
;
and
their
meeting
now
in
so
extraordinary
a
place
affect
both
of
them
with
an
equal
surprize
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
immaterial
ceremony
,
the
lady
acquaint
Mr.
Booth
that
,
have
hear
there
be
a
person
in
the
prison
who
know
her
by
the
name
of
Matthews
<EOS>
,
she
have
great
curiosity
to
inquire
who
he
be
,
whereupon
he
have
be
shew
to
her
from
the
window
of
the
house
;
that
she
immediately
recollect
him
,
and
,
be
inform
of
his
distressful
situation
,
for
which
she
express
great
concern
,
she
have
send
him
that
guinea
which
he
have
receive
the
day
before
;
and
then
proceed
to
excuse
herself
for
not
have
desire
to
see
him
at
that
time
,
when
she
be
under
the
great
disorder
and
hurry
of
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
make
many
handsome
acknowledgment
of
her
favour
;
and
add
that
he
very
little
wonder
at
the
disorder
of
her
spirit
,
conclude
that
he
be
heartily
concerned
at
see
her
there
;
"
but
I
hope
,
madam
,
"
say
he
   
<EOS>
here
he
hesitate
;
upon
which
,
burst
into
an
agony
of
tear
,
she
cry
out
,
"
o
captain
!
<EOS>
captain
!
<EOS>
many
extraordinary
thing
have
pass
since
last
I
see
you
.
<EOS>
o
gracious
heaven
!
<EOS>
do
I
ever
expect
that
this
would
be
the
next
place
of
our
meeting
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
fling
herself
into
her
chair
,
where
she
give
a
loose
to
her
passion
,
whilst
he
,
in
the
most
affectionate
and
tender
manner
,
endeavour
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
;
but
passion
itself
do
probably
more
for
its
own
relief
than
all
his
friendly
consolation
.
<EOS>
have
vent
this
in
a
large
flood
of
tear
,
she
become
pretty
well
composed
;
but
Booth
unhappily
mention
her
father
,
she
again
relapse
into
an
agony
,
and
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
why
will
you
repeat
the
name
of
that
dear
man
?
<EOS>
I
have
disgrace
him
,
Mr.
Booth
,
I
be
unworthy
the
name
of
his
daughter
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
passion
again
stop
her
word
,
and
discharge
itself
in
tear
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
second
vent
of
sorrow
or
shame
,
or
,
if
the
reader
please
,
of
rage
,
she
once
more
recover
from
her
agony
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
these
be
,
I
believe
,
as
critical
discharge
of
nature
as
any
of
those
which
be
so
call
by
the
physician
,
and
do
more
effectually
relieve
the
mind
than
any
remedy
with
which
the
whole
materia
medica
of
philosophy
can
supply
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Vincent
have
recover
her
faculty
,
she
perceive
Booth
stand
silent
,
with
a
mixture
of
concern
and
astonishment
in
his
countenance
;
then
address
herself
to
him
with
an
air
of
most
bewitching
softness
,
of
which
she
be
a
perfect
mistress
,
she
say
,
"
I
do
not
wonder
at
your
amazement
,
Captain
Booth
,
nor
indeed
at
the
concern
which
you
so
plainly
discover
for
me
;
for
I
well
know
the
goodness
of
your
nature
:
<EOS>
but
,
o
,
Mr.
Booth
!
<EOS>
believe
me
,
when
you
know
what
hath
happen
since
our
last
meeting
,
your
concern
will
be
raise
,
however
your
astonishment
may
cease

<EOS>
o

<EOS>
you
be
a

the
cause
of
my
sorrow

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
be
,
madam

"
answer
he
;
<EOS>
"
for
I
can
not
believe
what
I
have
hear
in
the
prison
 
surely
murder
"
 
a
t
which
word
she
start
from
her
chair
,
repeat
,
"
murder

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
it
be
music
in

You
have
hear
then
the

my
glory

my

<EOS>
yes

my
old

this
be
the
hand

this
be
the
arm
that
drive
the
penknife
to
his

unkind
fortune
,
that
not

drop
of
his
blood
reach
my
hand

<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
I
would
never
have
wash
it
from
it

<EOS>
but
,
though
I
have
not
the
happiness
to

it
on
my

I
have
the
glorious
satisfaction
of
remember
<EOS>
I
see
it
run
in
river
on
the
floor

I
see
it
forsake
his
cheek

I
see
him
fall
a
martyr

perhaps
the

call
it
so

<EOS>
let
it
call
it

no

I
be
undone

now
no

let
them
take
it
from

<EOS>
"
  
Our
poor
gentleman
turn
pale
with
horror
at
this
speech
,
and
the
ejaculation
of
"
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
do
I
hear
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
burst
spontaneously
from
his
lip
;
nor
can
we
wonder
at
this
,
though
he
be
the
brave
of
man
;
for
her
voice
,
her
look
,
her
gesture
,
be
properly
adapt

for

he
have
hear
some
imperfect
story

not

I
will
satisfy
it

<EOS>
He
answer
,
that
curiosity
be
too
mean
a
word
to
express
his
ardent
desire
of
know
her

before

to

a

to
the

who
have
,

,
begin
to
express
no

astonishment

Mr.
Booth

that
a

have
remark
a

extraordinary
power
of
display
softness

the

<EOS>
We
desire
such

to
remember
that
it
be
the

climate
,
in

,
on
the
lovely
10th
of

under

soft

the

warble
the
harmonious

again

roar
forth
treason

<EOS>
or
,
if
the
critic
be
a
Whig
,

consequently
dislike
such
kind
of
simile
,
as
be
too
favourable
to
Jacobitism

let
him
be
content
with
the
follow
story

I
happen
in
my
youth
to
sit
behind
two
lady
in
a
side
-
box
at
a
play
,
where
,
in
the
balcony
on
the
opposite
side
,
be
place
the
inimitable
<EOS>
B####y
c####s
,
in
company
with
a
young
fellow
of
no
very
formal
,
or
indeed
sober
,
appearance
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
lady
,
I
remember
,
say
to
the
other
 
"
do
you
ever
see
anything
look
so
modest
and
so
innocent
as
that
girl
over
the
way
?
<EOS>
what
pity
it
be
such
a
creature
should
be
in
the
way
of
ruin
,
as
I
be
afraid
she
be
,
by
her
be
alone
with
that
young
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
now
this
lady
be
no
bad
physiognomist
,
for
it
be
impossible
to
conceive
a
great
appearance
of
modesty
,
innocence
,
and
simplicity
,
than
what
nature
have
display
in
the
countenance
of
that
girl
;
and
yet
,
all
appearance
notwithstanding
,
I
myself
(
remember
,
critic
,
it
be
in
my
youth
)
have
a
few
morning
before
see
that
very
identical
picture
of
all
those
engage
quality
in
bed
with
a
rake
at
a
bagnio
,
smoake
tobacco
,
drink
punch
,
talk
obscenity
,
and
swearing
and
curse
with
all
the
impudence
and
impiety
of
the
low
and
most
abandon
trull
of
a
soldier

<EOS>
in
which
Miss
Matthews
begin
her
history

<EOS>
Miss
Matthews
,
have
bar
the
door
on
the
inside
as
securely
as
it
be
before
bar
on
the
outside
,
proceed
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
imagine
I
be
go
to
begin
my
history
at
the
time
when
you
leave
the
country
;
but
I
can
not
help
remind
you
of
something
which
happen
before
.
<EOS>
You
will
soon
recollect
the
incident
;
but
I
believe
you
little
know
the
consequence
either
at
that
time
or
since
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
I
could
keep
a
secret
then
!
<EOS>
now
I
have
no
secret
;
the
world
know
all
;
and
it
be
not
worth
my
while
to
conceal
anything
.
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
wonder
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
protest
I
can
hardly
tell
it
you
,
even
now
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
convinced
you
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
yourself
to
be
surprize
at
any
conquest
you
may
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
few
man
want
that
good
opinion
 
and
perhaps
very
few
have
ever
more
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Will
,
you
be
a
charming
fellow
in
those
day
;
nay
,
you
be
not
much
alter
for
the
bad
now
,
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
some
woman
;
for
your
complexion
and
feature
be
grow
much
more
masculine
than
they
be
.
"
<EOS>
here
Booth
make
her
a
low
bow
,
most
probably
with
a
compliment
;
and
after
a
little
hesitation
she
again
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
remember
a
contest
which
happen
at
an
assembly
,
betwixt
myself
and
Miss
Johnson
,
about
stand
uppermost
?
<EOS>
you
be
then
my
partner
;
and
young
Williams
dance
with
the
other
lady
.
<EOS>
the
particular
be
not
now
worth
mention
,
though
I
suppose
you
have
long
since
forget
them
.
<EOS>
let
it
suffice
that
you
support
my
claim
,
and
Williams
very
sneakingly
give
up
that
of
his
partner
,
who
be
,
with
much
difficulty
,
afterwards
prevail
to
dance
with
him
.
<EOS>
You
say
 
I
be
sure
I
repeat
the
word
exactly
 
that
you
would
not
for
the
world
affront
any
lady
there
;
but
that
you
think
you
may
,
without
any
such
danger
declare
,
that
there
be
no
assembly
in
which
that
lady
,
mean
your
humble
servant
,
be
not
worthy
of
the
uppermost
place
;
"
nor
will
I
,
"
say
you
,
"
suffer
,
the
first
duke
in
England
,
when
she
be
at
the
uppermost
end
of
the
room
,
and
hath
call
her
dance
,
to
lead
his
partner
above
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
make
this
the
more
pleasing
to
me
be
,
that
I
secretly
hate
Miss
Johnson
.
<EOS>
Will
you
have
the
reason
?
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
I
will
tell
you
honestly
,
she
be
my
rival
.
<EOS>
that
word
perhaps
astonish
you
,
as
you
never
,
I
believe
,
hear
of
any
one
who
make
his
address
to
me
;
and
indeed
my
heart
be
,
till
that
night
,
entirely
indifferent
to
all
mankind
:
<EOS>
I
mean
,
then
,
that
she
be
my
rival
for
praise
,
for
beauty
,
for
dress
,
for
fortune
,
and
consequently
for
admiration
.
<EOS>
My
triumph
on
this
conquest
be
not
to
be
express
any
more
than
my
delight
in
the
person
to
whom
I
chiefly
owe
it
.
<EOS>
the
former
,
I
fancy
,
be
visible
to
the
whole
company
;
and
I
desire
it
should
be
so
;
but
the
latter
be
so
well
conceal
,
that
no
one
,
I
be
confident
,
take
any
notice
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
yet
you
appear
to
me
that
night
to
be
an
angel
.
<EOS>
You
look
,
you
dance
,
you
speak
-
<EOS>
everything
charm
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
Heavens
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Booth
,
"
be
it
possible
<EOS>
you
should
do
me
so
much
unmerited
honour
,
and
I
should
be
dunce
enough
not
to
perceive
the
least
symptom

I
assure

answer
she

I
do
all
I
could

prevent
you

I
almost
hate
you

see
through
what
I
strove
to
hide

<EOS>
why
,
Mr.
Booth
,
be
you
not
more
quick

sighted

<EOS>
I
will
answer
for
you
 
<EOS>
your
affection
be
more
happily
disposed
of
to
a
much
well
woman
than
myself
,
whom
you
marry
soon
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
should
ask
you
for
her
,
Mr.
Booth
;
I
should
have
ask
you
for
her
before
;
but
I
be
unworthy
of
ask
for
her
,
or
of
call
her
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
stopt
her
short
,
as
she
be
run
into
another
fit
of
passion
,
and
beg
her
to
omit
all
former
matter
,
and
acquaint
him
with
that
part
of
her
history
to
which
he
be
an
entire
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
She
then
renew
her
discourse
as
follow
:
"
You
know
,
Mr.
Booth
,
I
soon
afterwards
leave
that
town
,
upon
the
death
of
my
grandmother
,
and
return
home
to
my
father
's
house
;
where
I
have
not
be
long
arrive
before
some
troop
of
dragoon
come
to
quarter
in
our
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
among
the
officer
there
be
a
cornet
whose
detest
name
be
Hebbers
,
a
name
I
could
scarce
repeat
,
<EOS>
have
I
not
at
the
same
time
the
pleasure
to
reflect
that
he
be
now
no
more
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
you
know
,
who
be
a
hearty
well
-
wisher
to
the
present
government
,
use
always
to
invite
the
officer
to
his
house
;
so
do
he
these
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
long
before
this
cornet
in
so
particular
a
manner
recommend
himself
to
the
poor
old
gentleman
(
I
can
not
think
of
him
without
tear
)
,
that
our
house
become
his
principal
habitation
,
and
he
be
rarely
at
his
quarter
,
unless
when
his
superior
officer
oblige
him
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
I
shall
say
nothing
of
his
person
,
nor
could
that
be
any
recommendation
to
a
man
;
it
be
such
,
however
,
as
no
woman
could
have
make
an
objection
to
.
<EOS>
nature
have
certainly
wrapt
up
her
odious
work
in
a
most
beautiful
covering
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
he
be
the
handsome
man
,
except
one
only
,
that
I
ever
see
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
I
have
see
a
handsomer
 
but
 
<EOS>
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
,
besides
,
all
the
qualification
of
a
gentleman
;
be
genteel
and
extremely
polite
;
speak
French
well
,
and
dance
to
a
miracle
;
but
what
chiefly
recommend
him
to
my
father
be
his
skill
in
music
,
of
which
you
know
that
dear
man
be
the
most
violent
lover
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
be
not
too
susceptible
of
flattery
on
that
head
;
for
I
have
hear
hebber
often
greatly
commend
my
father
's
performance
,
and
have
observe
that
the
good
man
be
wonderfully
pleased
with
such
commendation
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
it
be
the
only
way
I
can
account
for
the
extraordinary
friendship
which
my
father
conceive
for
this
person
;
such
a
friendship
,
that
he
at
last
become
a
part
of
our
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
very
circumstance
,
which
,
as
I
be
convinced
,
strongly
recommend
him
to
my
father
,
have
the
very
contrary
effect
with
me
:
I
have
never
any
delight
in
music
,
and
it
be
not
without
much
difficulty
I
be
prevail
on
to
learn
to
play
on
the
harpsichord
,
in
which
I
have
make
a
very
slend
progress
.
<EOS>
as
this
man
,
therefore
,
be
frequently
the
occasion
of
my
be
importune
to
play
against
my
will
,
I
begin
to
entertain
some
dislike
for
him
on
that
account
;
and
as
to
his
person
,
I
assure
you
,
I
long
continue
to
look
on
it
with
great
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
strange
will
the
art
of
this
man
appear
to
you
presently
,
who
have
sufficient
address
to
convert
that
very
circumstance
which
have
at
first
occasion
my
dislike
into
the
first
seed
of
affection
for
him
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
often
,
I
believe
,
hear
my
sister
Betty
play
on
the
harpsichord
;
she
be
,
indeed
,
repute
the
good
performer
in
the
whole
country
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
the
farth
in
the
world
from
regard
this
perfection
of
her
with
envy
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
perhaps
,
I
despise
all
perfection
of
this
kind
:
at
least
,
as
I
have
neither
skill
nor
ambition
to
excel
this
way
,
I
look
upon
it
as
a
matter
of
mere
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
hebber
first
put
this
emulation
in
my
head
.
<EOS>
He
take
great
pain
to
persuade
me
that
I
have
much
great
ability
of
the
musical
kind
than
my
sister
,
and
that
I
may
with
the
great
ease
,
if
I
please
,
excel
her
;
offer
me
,
at
the
same
time
,
his
assistance
if
I
would
resolve
to
undertake
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
he
have
sufficiently
inflame
my
ambition
,
in
which
,
perhaps
,
he
find
too
little
difficulty
,
the
continual
praise
of
my
sister
,
which
before
I
have
disregard
,
become
more
and
more
nauseous
in
my
ear
;
and
the
rather
,
as
,
music
be
the
favourite
passion
of
my
father
,
I
become
apprehensive
(
not
without
frequent
hint
from
hebber
of
that
nature
)
that
she
may
gain
too
great
a
preference
in
his
favour
.

Hebbers

at

declare
himself
on
my
side

and
nobody
could
doubt
his
judgment

He
assert
openly
that
I
play
in
the
well

of
the
two

one
day
,
when
I
be
play

burst
into

admiration

squeeze
me
gently

,
there

madam

I
now
declare
you
excel
your

much
in
music

,
add
he
in

whisper
sigh

you
do
her

all

no

bear
any
superiority

hate
all
the
admirer
of
my

to
be
uneasy
at
every
commendation
bestow
on
her
skill
in
music

consequently
to
love
hebber

the
preference
which

give

It
be
now
that
I
begin
to
survey
the
handsome
person
of
Hebbers
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
and
here
,
Mr.
Booth
,
I
will
betray
to
you
the
grand
secret
of
our
sex
.
 
<EOS>
many
woman
,
I
believe
,
do
,
with
great
innocence
,
and
even
with
great
indifference
,
converse
with
man
of
the
fine
person
;
but
this
I
be
confident
may
be
affirm
with
truth
,
that
,
when
once
a
woman
come
to
ask
this
question
of
herself
,
be
the
man
whom
I
like
for
some
other
reason
,
handsome
?
<EOS>
her
fate
and
his
too
,
very
strongly
depend
on
her
answering
in
the
affirmative
.
  
<EOS>
"
hebber
no
sooner
perceive
that
he
have
make
an
impression
on
my
heart
,
of
which
I
be
satisfied
I
give
him
too
undeniable
token
,
than
he
affect
on
a
sudden
to
shun
me
in
the
most
apparent
manner
.
<EOS>
He
wear
the
most
melancholy
air
in
my
presence
,
and
,
by
his
dejected
look
and
sigh
,
firmly
persuade
me
that
there
be
some
secret
sorrow
labour
in
his
bosom
;
nor
will
it
be
difficult
for
you
to
imagine
to
what
cause
<EOS>
I
impute
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
whilst
I
be
wish
for
his
declaration
of
a
passion
in
which
I
think
I
could
not
be
mistaken
,
and
at
the
same
time
tremble
whenever
we
meet
with
the
apprehension
of
this
very
declaration
,
the
widow
Carey
come
from
London
to
make
us
a
visit
,
intend
to
stay
the
whole
summer
at
our
house

<EOS>
"
those
who
know
Mrs.
Carey
will
scarce
think
I
do
her
an
injury
in
say
she
be
far
from
be
handsome
;
and
yet
she
be
as
finish
a
coquette
as
if
she
have
the
high
beauty
to
support
that
character
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
have
see
her
;
and
if
you
have
I
be
convince
you
will
readily
subscribe
to
my
opinion
.

<EOS>
Booth
answer
he
have
not
;
and
then
she
proceed
as
in
the
follow
chapter

<EOS>
the
history
of
Miss
Matthews
continue

<EOS>
"
this
young
lady
have
not
be
three
day
with
us

hebber
grow
so
particular

her

it

generally

my
poor
father

who
,
I

,
love
the
cornet
as

begin
to
jest

the
occasion

one
who
would
not

at
throw
a
good
jointure
into
the
arm
of
his
friend

<EOS>
"
You
will
easily
guess
,
sir
,
the
disposition
of
my
mind
on
this
occasion
;
but
I
be
not
permit
to
suffer
long
under
it
;
for
one
day
,
when
Hebbers
be
alone
with
me
,
he
take
an
opportunity
of
express
his
abhorrence
at
the
thought
of
marry
for
interest
,
contrary
to
his
inclination
.
<EOS>
I
be
warm
on
the
subject
,
and
,
I
believe
,
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
none
but
fool
and
villain
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
reply
,
with
a
sigh
,
yes
,
madam
,
but
what
would
you
think
of
a
man
whose
heart
be
all
the
while
bleed
for
another
woman
,
to
whom
he
would
willingly
sacrifice
the
world
;
but
,
because
he
must
sacrifice
her
interest
as
well
as
his
own
,
never
durst
even
give
her
a
hint
of
that
passion
which
be
prey
on
his
very
vital
?
"
<EOS>
do
you
believe
,
Miss
Fanny
,
there
be
such
a
wretch
on
earth
?
<EOS>
"
I
answer
,
with
an
assumed
coldness
,
I
do
not
believe
there
be
.
<EOS>
He
then
take
me
gently
by
the
hand
,
and
,
with
a
look
so
tender
that
I
can
not
describe
it

vow
he
be
himself
that
wretch

<EOS>
then
start
,
as
if
conscious
of
an
error
commit

he
cry
with
a
falter
voice

what
be

<EOS>
pardon
me

Miss
Fanny

I

only
your

for
more

at

up

I
doubt
not

that

the
most

think
him
every

I

design

honourable

to
blind
these

I
consent
that
he
should
carry
on
sham
address
to
the
widow

who
be
now
a
constant
jest
between

pretend
from

<EOS>
at
this
remark

Booth

though
enough
affect
at
some
part
of
the
story

have
great
difficulty
to
refrain
from
laughter

by
good
luck

the
lady
go
on
without

<EOS>
"
I
be
come
now
to
a
part
of
my
narrative
in
which
it
be
impossible
to
be
particular
without
be
tedious
;
for
,
as
to
the
commerce
between
lover
,
it
be
,
I
believe
,
much
the
same
in
all
case
;
and
there
be
,
perhaps
,
scarce
a
single
phrase
that
hath
not
be
repeat
ten
million
of
time

<EOS>
"
one
thing
,
however
,
as
I
strongly
remark
it
then
,
so
I
will
repeat
it
to
you
now

<EOS>
in
all
our
conversation

in
moment
when
he
fall
into
the
warm
rapture
,
and
expr
the
great
uneasiness
at
the
delay
of
his
joy
,
he
seldom
mention
the
word
marriage
;
and
never
once
solicit
a
day
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
woman
can
not
be
caution
too
much
against
such
lover
;
for
though
I
have
hear
,
and
perhaps
truly
,
of
some
of
our
sex
,
of
a
virtue
so
exalted
,
that
it
be
proof
against
every
temptation
;
yet
the
generality

I
be
afraid
,
be
too
much
in
the
power
of
a
man
to
whom
they
have
own
an
affection
.
<EOS>
what
be
call
be
upon
a
good
footing
be
,
perhaps
,
be
upon
a
very
dangerous
one
;
and
a
woman
who
hath
give
her
consent
to
marry
can
hardly
be
say
to
be
safe
till
she
be
married
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
sir
,
I
hasten
to
the
period
of
my
ruin

<EOS>
We
have
a
wedding
in
our
family

my
musical
sister
be
marry
to
a
young
fellow
as
musical
as
herself

<EOS>
such
a
match
,
you
may
be
sure
,
amongst
other
festivity
,
must
have
a
ball
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
,
shall
modesty
forbid
me
to
remark
to
you
what
past
on
that
occasion
?
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
mention
modesty
,
who
have
no
pretension
to
it
?
<EOS>
everything
be
say
and
practise
on
that
occasion
,
as
if
the
purpose
have
be
to
inflame
the
mind
of
every
woman
present
.
<EOS>
that
effect

I
freely
own

have

me

music
,
dancing
,
wine

and
the
most
luscious
conversation
,
in
which
my
poor
dear
father
innocently
join
,
raise
idea
in
me
of
which
I
shall
for
ever
repent
;
and
I
wish
(
why
should
I
deny
it
?
)
<EOS>
that
it
have
be
my
wedding
instead
of

the
villain
Hebbers
dance
with
me
that
night
,
and
he
lose
no
opportunity
of
improve
the
occasion

<EOS>
in
short
,
the
dreadful
evening
come

it
be
a
very
unusual
thing
with
him
,
grow
intoxicate
with
liquor

most
of
the
man
be
in
the

condition

nay
,
I
myself
drink
more
than
I
be
accustomed
to

enough
to
inflame
,

not
to
disorder

<EOS>
I
lose
my
former

fellow

you
<EOS>
may
,
I
think
,
guess
the
rest
 
<EOS>
the
villain
find
mean
to
steal
to
my
chamber
,
and
I
be
undone

<EOS>
"
two
month
I
pass
in
this
detest
commerce

buying
,
even
then
,
my
guilty

half
-
taste
pleasure
at
too
dear
a
rate

with
continual
horror

what
have
I
pay
since
 
what
do
I
pay
now

o
may
my
fate
be
a
warning
to
every
woman
to
keep
her
innocence
,
to
resist
every
temptation
,
since
she
be
certain
to
repent
of
the
foolish
bargain

<EOS>
May
it
be
a
warning
to
her
to
deal
with
mankind
with
care
and
caution
;
to
shun
the
least
approach
of
dishonour
,
and
never
to
confide
too
much
in
the
honesty
of
a
man

nor
in
her
own
strength

where
she
have
so
much
at
stake

let
her
remember
she
walk
on
a
precipice

the
bottomless
pit
be
to
receive
her
if
she
slip
;
<EOS>
nay

if
she
make
but
one
false
step

<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Booth
;
I
may
have
spare
these
exhortation
,
since
no
woman
hear
me
;
but
you
will
not
wonder
at
see
me
affect
on
this
occasion

<EOS>
Booth
declare
he
be
much
more
surprised
at
her
be
able
so
well
to
preserve
her
temper
in
recount
her
story

<EOS>
"
o
sir
,
"
answer
she
,
"
I
be
at
length
reconcile
to
my
fate
;
and
I
can
now
die
with
pleasure
,
since
I
die
revenge
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
one

those
mean
wretch

can
sit
down

lament
their
misfortune

<EOS>
if
I
ever
shed
tear

they

the
tear

indignation

I
will
proceed

It
be
my
fate
now

solicit
marriage

fail
not

He
answer
me
at
first
with
procrastination

declare
,
from
time
to
time
,
he
would
mention
it
to
my
father
;
and
still
excuse
himself
for
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
think
on
an
expedient
to
obtain
a
long
reprieve
.
<EOS>
this
be
by
pretend
that
he
should
,
in
a
very
few
week
,
be
prefer
to
the
command
of
a
troop
;
and
then
,
he
say
,
he
could
with
some
confidence
propose
the
match
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
this
delay
I
be
persuade
to
acquiesce
,

be
indeed
pretty
easy
,
for
I
have
not
yet
the
least
mistrust
of
his
honour
;
but
what
word
can
paint
my
sensation
,
when
one
morning
he
come
into
my
room
,
with
all
the
mark
of
dejection
in
his
countenance
,
and
,
throw
an
open
letter
on
the
table
,
say
,
"
there
be
news

letter

him

they
call

march
within
two

convinced

I
will
have
no
excuse
<EOS>
,
no
delay
 
make
me
your
wife
this
instant
,
or
I
will
proclaim
you
over
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
for
the
great
of
villain

<EOS>
He
answer
,
with
a
kind
of
sneer
,
"
what
will
you
proclaim
,
madam
?
 
<EOS>
whose
honour
will
you
injure
?

"
<EOS>
My
tongue
falter
when
I
offer
to
reply
,
and
I
fall
into
a
violent
agony
,
which
end
in
a
fit
;
nor
do
I
remember
anything
<EOS>
more
that
past
<EOS>
till
I
find
myself
in
the
arm
of
my
poor
affright
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
,
Mr.
Booth
,
what
be
then
my
situation
!
<EOS>
I
tremble
even
now
from
the
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
stop
a
moment
.
<EOS>
I
can
go
no
farther
.
"
<EOS>
Booth
attempt
all
in
his
power
to
soothe
her
;
and
she
soon
recover
her
power
,
and
proceed
in
her
story
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Miss
Matthews
conclude
her
relation
.
 
<EOS>
before
I
have
recover
my
sense
I
have
sufficiently
betray
myself
to
the
good
of
man
,
who
,
instead
of
upbraid
me
,
or
exert
any
anger
,
endeavour
to
comfort
me
all
he
could
with
assurance
that
all
should
yet
be
well
.
<EOS>
this
goodness
of
his
affect
me
with
inexpressible
sensation
;
I
prostrate
myself
before
him
,
embrace
and
kiss
his
knee
,
and
almost
dissolve
in
tear
,
and
a
degree
of
tenderness
hardly
to
be
conceive
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
run
into
too
minute
description
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hebbers
,
see
me
in
a
fit
,
have
leave
me
,
and
send
one
of
the
servant
to
take
care
of
me
.
<EOS>
He
then
run
away
like
a
thief
from
the
house
,
without
take
his
leave
of
my
father
,
or
once
thank
him
for
all
his
civility
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
stop
at
his
quarter
,
but
make
directly
to
London
,
apprehensive
,
I
believe
,
either
of
my
father
or
brother
's
resentment
;
for
I
be
convinced
he
be
a
coward
.
<EOS>
indeed
his
fear
of
my
brother
be
utterly
groundless
;
for
I
believe
he
would
rather
have
thank
any
man
who
have
destroy
me
;
and
I
be
sure
I
be
not
in
the
least
behindhand
with
him
in
good
wish
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
his
inveteracy
to
me
have
,
however
,
no
effect
on
my
father

at

at
that
time
;
for
,
though
the
good
man
take
sufficient
occasion
to
reprimand
me
for
my
past
offence
,
he
could
not
be
bring
to
abandon
me

<EOS>
a
treaty
of
marriage
be
now
set
on
foot
,
in
which
my
father
himself
offer
me
to
Hebbers
,
with
a
fortune
superior
to
that
which
have
be
give
with
my
sister
;
nor
could
all
my
brother
's
remonstrance
against
it
,
as
an
act
of
the
high
injustice

avail
.
  
<EOS>
"
hebber
enter
into
the
treaty
,
though
not
with
much
warmth
.
<EOS>
He
have
even
the
assurance
to
make
additional
demand
on
my
father
,
which
be
comply
with
,
everything

,
and
the
villain
once
more

into
the
house

<EOS>
He
soon
find
mean
to
obtain
my
forgiveness
of
his
former
behaviour
;
indeed
,
he
convince
me
,
so
foolishly
blind
be
female
love
,
that
he
have
never
be
to
blame
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
everything
be
ready
for
our
nuptial
,
and
the
day
of
the
ceremony
be
to
be
appoint
,
in
the
midst
of
my
happiness
I
receive
a
letter
from
an
unknown
hand
,
acquaint
me
(
guess
,
Mr.
Booth
<EOS>
,
how
I
be
shocked
at
receive
it
)
<EOS>
that
Mr.
Hebbers
be
already
marry
to
a
woman
in
a
distant
part
of
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
tire
you
with
all
that
past
at
our
next
interview
.
<EOS>
I
communicate
the
letter
to
Hebbers
,
who
,
after
some
little
hesitation
,
own
the
fact
,
and
not
only
own
it
,
but
have
the
address
to
improve
it
to
his
own
advantage
,
to
make
it
the
mean
of
satisfy
me
concern
all
his
former
delay
;
which
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
be
not
so
much
displeased
at
impute
to
any
degree
of
villany
,
as
I
should
have
be
to
impute
it
to
the
want
of
a
sufficient
warmth
of
affection
,
and
though
the
disappointment
of
all
my
hope
,
at
the
very
instant
of
their
expect
fruition
,
throw
me
into
the
most
violent
disorder
;
yet
,
when
I
come
a
little
to
myself
,
he
have
no
great
difficulty
to
persuade
me
that
in
every
instance
,
with
regard
to
me
,
Hebbers
have
act
from
no
other
motive
than
from
the
most
ardent
and
ungovernable
love
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
,
I
believe
,
no
crime
which
a
woman
will
not
forgive
,
when
she
can
derive
it
from
that
fountain
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
forgave
him
all
,
and
be
willing
to
persuade
myself
I
be
not
weak
than
the
rest
of
my
sex
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mr.
Booth
,
he
hath
a
bewitching
tongue
,
and
be
master
of
an
address
that
no
woman
could
resist
.
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
the
charm
of
his
person
be
his
least
perfection
,
at
least
in
my
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
Booth
smile
,
but
happily
without
her
perceive
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
fresh
difficulty
(
continue
she
)
now
arise
.
<EOS>
this
be
to
excuse
the
delay
of
the
ceremony
to
my
father
,
who
every
day
very
earnestly
urge
it
.
<EOS>
this
make
me
so
very
uneasy
,
that
I
at
last
listen
to
a
proposal
,
which
,
if
any
one
in
the
day
of
my
innocence
,
or
even
a
few
day
before
,
have
assure
me
I
could
have
submit
to
have
think
of
,
I
should
have
treat
the
supposition
with
the
high
contempt
and
indignation
;
nay
,
I
scarce
reflect
on
it
now
with
more
horror
than
astonishment
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
agree
to
run
away
with
him
 
to
leave
my
father
,
my
reputation
,
everything
which
be
or
ought
to
have
be
dear
to
me
,
and
to
live
with
this
villain
as
a
mistress
,
since
I
could
not
be
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
this
an
obligation
of
the
high
and
tender
kind
,
and
have
I
not
reason
to
expect
every
return
in
the
man
's
power
on
whom
I
have
confer
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
short
of
the
remainder
of
my
story
,
for
what
be
there
of
a
woman
worth
relate
,
after
what
I
have
tell
you
?
  
<EOS>
"
above
a
year
I
live
with
this
man
in
an
obscure
court
in
London
,
during
which
time
I
have
a
child
by
him
,
whom
Heaven
,
I
thank
it
,
<EOS>
hath
be
pleased
to
take
to
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
during
many
month
he
behave
to
me
with
all
the
apparent
tenderness
and
even
fondness
imaginable
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
how
poor
be
my
enjoyment
of
this
compare
to
what
it
would
have
be
in
another
situation
?
<EOS>
when
he
be
present
,
life
be
barely
tolerable
:
but
,
when
he
be
absent
,
nothing
could
equal
the
misery
I
endure
.
<EOS>
I
past
my
hour
almost
entirely
alone
;
for
no
company
but
what
I
despise
,
would
consort
with
me
.
<EOS>
abroad
I
scarce
ever
go
,
lest
I
should
meet
any
of
my
former
acquaintance
;
for
their
sight
would
have
plunge
a
thousand
dagger
in
my
soul
.
<EOS>
My
only
diversion
be
go
very
seldom
to
a
play
,
where
I
hide
myself
in
the
gallery
,
with
a
daughter
of
the
woman
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
a
girl
,
indeed
,
of
good
sense
and
many
good
quality
;
but
how
much
beneath
me
be
it
to
be
the
companion
of
a
creature
so
low
!
<EOS>
o
heaven
!
<EOS>
when
I
have
see
my
equal
glitter
in
a
side
-
box
,
how
have
the
thought
of
my
lost
honour
tear
my
soul
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
,
dear
madam
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
for
interrupt
you
;
but
<EOS>
I
be
under
the
utmost
anxiety
to
know
what
become
of
your
poor
father
,
for
whom
I
have
so
great
a
respect
,
and
who
,
I
be
convinced
,
must
so
bitterly
feel
your
loss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
Mr.
Booth
,
"
answer
she
,
"
he
be
scarce
ever
out
of
my
thought
.
<EOS>
His
dear
image
still
obtrude
itself
in
my
mind
,
and
I
believe
would
have
break
my
heart
,
have
I
not
take
a
very
preposterous
way
to
ease
myself
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
indeed
,
almost
ashamed
to
tell
you
;
but
necessity
put
it
in
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
think
the
matter
too
trifle
to
have
be
remember
,
and
so
it
surely
be
;
nor
should
I
have
remember
it
on
any
other
occasion
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
then
,
sir
,
that
my
brother
be
always
my
inveterate
enemy
and
altogether
as
fond
of
my
sister
.
 
<EOS>
He
once
prevail
with
my
father
to
let
him
take
my
sister
with
him
in
the
chariot
,
and
by
that
mean
I
be
disappointed
of
go
to
a
ball
which
I
have
set
my
heart
on
.
<EOS>
the
disappointment
,
I
assure
you
,
be
great
at
the
time
;
but
I
have
long
since
forget
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
be
a
very
bad
woman
if
I
have
not
,
for
it
be
the
only
thing
in
which
I
can
remember
that
my
father
ever
disoblige
me
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
now
revive
this
in
my
mind
,
which
I
artificially
work
up
into
so
high
an
injury
,
that
I
assure
you
it
afford
me
no
little
comfort
.
<EOS>
when
any
tender
idea
intrude
into
my
bosom
,
I
immediately
raise
this
fantom
of
an
injury
in
my
imagination
,
and
it
considerably
lessen
the
fury
of
that
sorrow
which
I
should
have
otherwise
feel
for
the
loss
of
so
good
a
father
,
who
die
within
a
few
month
of
my
departure
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
sir
,
to
draw
to
a
conclusion
.
<EOS>
one
night
,
as
I
be
in
the
gallery
at
Drury
-
lane
playhouse
,
I
see
below
me
in
a
side
-
box
<EOS>
(
she
be
once
below
me
in
every
place
)
,
that
widow
whom
I
mention
to
you
before
.
<EOS>
I
have
scarce
cast
my
eye
on
this
woman
before
I
be
so
shocked
with
the
sight
that
it
almost
deprive
me
of
my
sense
;
for
the
villain
Hebbers
come
presently
in
and
seat
himself
behind
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
almost
a
month
from
me
,
and
I
believe
him
to
be
at
his
quarter
in
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
guess
what
be
my
sensation
when
I
beheld
him
sit
by
that
base
woman
,
and
talk
to
her
with
the
utmost
familiarity
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
long
endure
this
sight
,
and
have
acquaint
my
companion
that
I
be
take
suddenly
ill
,
I
force
her
to
go
home
with
me
at
the
end
of
the
second
act
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
a
restless
and
sleepless
night
,
when
I
rise
the
next
morning
I
have
the
comfort
to
receive
a
visit
from
the
woman
of
the
house
,
who
,
after
a
very
short
introduction
,
ask
me
when
I
have
hear
from
the
captain
,
and
when
I
expect
to
see
him
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
strength
or
spirit
to
make
her
any
answer
,
and
she
proceed
thus
:
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
do
not
think
the
captain
would
have
use
me
so
.
<EOS>
My
husband
be
an
officer
of
the
army
as
well
as
himself
;
and
if
a
body
be
a
little
low
in
the
world
,
I
be
sure
that
be
no
reason
for
folk
to
trample
on
a
body
.
<EOS>
I
defy
the
world
to
say
as
I
ever
be
guilty
of
an
ill
thing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
heaven
's
sake
,
madam
,
say
I
,
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
mean
?

cry
she
;
"
I
be
sure
,
if
I
have
not
think
you
have
be
Captain
Hebbers

lady
,
his
lawful
lady
too
,
you
should
never
have
set
foot

I
would
have
Captain
Hebbers
know

that
though
I
be
reduce
to
let
lodging

I
never
have
entertain
any

character

"
 
<EOS>
in
this
manner
,
sir
,
she
run
on
,
say
many
shocking
thing
not
worth
repeat
,
till
my
anger
at
last
get
the
well
of
my
patience
as
well
as
my
sorrow
,
and
I
push
her
out
of
the
room

She
have
not
be
long
go
before
her
daughter
come
to
me

,
after
many
expression
of
tenderness

pity

acquaint
me

just

out

she
,

be
sorry
to

messenger

ill
news

think
,
Mr.
Booth

what
I
must
have
endure
to
see
myself
humble
before
such
a
creature
as
this
,
the
daughter
of
a
woman
who
let
lodging

<EOS>
however
,
have
recollect
myself
a
little
,
I
think
it
would
be
in
vain
to
deny
anything

so
,
know
this
to
be
one
of

best

natured

most
sensible
girl

tell
her
my
whole

good
deal

assurance

dead
on

it

with
great
difficulty
I
be
bring
back

neither

Scarce

twenty

"
I
need
not
mention
my
indignation
at
these

<EOS>
in
the
high
agony
of
rage

I
go
in
a
chair
to
the
detest

I
easily
get
access
to
the
wretch

have
devote
to
destruction

whom
I
no

find

I
plunge
a

penknife

with
pleasure
receive
the
sentence

that

hope
her
sentence
would
be
mild

<EOS>
Her
reply
to
this
be
full
of
so
much
bitterness

indignation
,
that
we
do
not
think
proper
to
record
the
speech
at
length
,
in
which
have
vent
her
passion

she
all
at

put
on
a
serene
countenance

with
an
air
of
great
complacency

"
well

Mr.

I
may
say
it

after
the
usual
apology

have

acquaint

as

relate

the
murder

shake
his

"
there
be
but
one
circumstance
,
madam

which
I
wish
be
out
of
the
case

and
that
we
must
put
out
of
it
;
I
mean
<EOS>
the
carry
the
penknife
draw
into
the
room

you

for
that
seem
to
imply
malice
prepensive

we
call
it

this
circumstance

must
not
appear
against
you

if
the
servant
who
be

room
observe
this

he
must
be
buy
off
at

hazard

all
here
you
say
be
friend

therefore
I
tell
you
openly

you
must
furnish
me
with
money
sufficient

this
purpose

malice
be
all
we

guard
against

I
would
not

Booth

inform
you

I
have
hear
,
<EOS>
in
case
of
stabbing
,
a
man
may
be
indict
upon
the
statute
;

it
be
capital

though
no
malice
appear

<EOS>
"
You
say
true

sir

answer
Murphy
;
"
a
man
may
be
indict
contra
formam
statutis

that
method

I
allow
you

require
no
malice

I

you
be
a
lawyer

no

Booth

I
know
nothing

then
,
sir

I
will
tell
you
 
if
a
man
be
indict
contra
formam
tatutis
,
as
we
say
,
no
malice
be
necessary
,
because
the
form
of
the
statute
make
malice
;
and
then
what
we
have
to
guard
against
be
have
strike
the
first
blow
.
<EOS>
Pox
on't
,
it
be
unlucky
this
be
do
in
a
room
<EOS>
:
if
it
have
be
in
the
street
we
could
have
have
five
or
six
witness
to
have
prove
the
first
blow
,
cheap
than
,
I
be
afraid
,
we
shall
get
this
one
;
for
when
a
man
know
,
from
the
unhappy
circumstance
of
the
case
,
that
you
can
procure
no
other
witness
but
himself
,
he
be
always
dear
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
in
all
other
way
of
business
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
implicit
,
you
see
;
but
we
be
all
among
friend
.
<EOS>
the
safe
way
be
to
furnish
me
with
money
enough
to
offer
him
a
good
round
sum
at
once
;
and
I
think
(
it
be
for
your
good
<EOS>
I
speak
)
<EOS>
fifty
pound
be
the
least
than
can
be
offer
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
I
would
offer
him
no
less
<EOS>
be
it
my
own
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
do
you
think
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
I
would
save
my
life
at
the
expense
of
hire
another
to
perjure
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
surely
do
I
,
"
cry
Murphy
;
"
for
where
be
the
fault
,
admit
there
be
some
fault
in
perjury
,
as
you
call
it
?
<EOS>
and
,
to
be
sure
,
it
be
such
a
matter
as
every
man
would
rather
wish
to
avoid
than
not
:
and
yet
,
as
it
may
be
manage
<EOS>
,
there
be
not
so
much
as
some
people
be
apt
to
imagine
in
it
;
for
he
nee
not
kiss
the
book
,
and
then
pray
where
be
the
perjury
?
<EOS>
but
if
the
crier
be
sharp
than
ordinary
,
what
be
it
<EOS>
he
kiss
?
<EOS>
be
it
anything
but
a
bit
of
calf'
-
skin
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
a
man
must
be
a
very
bad
christian
himself
who
would
not
do
so
much
as
that
to
save
the
life
of
any
christian
<EOS>
whatever
,
much
more
of
so
pretty
a
lady

<EOS>
indeed
,
madam
,
if
we
can
make
out
but
a
tolerable
case
,
so
much
beauty
will
go
a
great
way
with
the
judge
and
the
jury
too

<EOS>
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
,
notwithstanding
the
mouth
it
come
from
,
cause
Miss
Matthews
to
suppress
much
of
the
indignation
which
begin
to
arise
at
the
former
;
and
she
answer
with
a
smile
,
"
Sir

you
be
a
great
casuist

these
matter

we
need
argue
no
longer

,
if
fifty
pound
would
save
my

I
assure
you
I
could
not

that
sum

the
little
money
I
have
in

all
I
can
call

have
very
little

after

liberality

Mr.
Murphy
,
life
be
sweet
,
as
you
say
,
that
must
be
acknowledge
;
to
be
sure
,
life
be
sweet
;
but
,
sweet
as
it
be
,
no
person
can
advance
more
than
they
be
worth
to
save
it
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
if
the
lady
can
command
no
more
money
than
that
little
she
mention
,
she
be
to
be
commend
for
her
unwillingness
to
part
with
any
of
it
;
for
,
to
be
sure
,
as
she
say
,
she
will
want
every
farthing
of
that
to
live
like
a
gentlewoman
till
she
come
to
her
trial
.
<EOS>
and
,
to
be
sure
,
as
sweet
as
life
be
,
people
ought
to
take
care
to
be
able
to
live
sweetly
while
they
do
live
;
besides
,
I
can
not
help
say
the
lady
shew
herself
to
be
what
she
be
,
by
her
abhorrence
of
perjury
,
which
be
certainly
a
very
dreadful
crime
.
<EOS>
and
,
though
the
not
kiss
the
book
doth
,
as
you
say
,
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
;
and
,
if
a
man
have
a
great
while
to
live
and
repent
,
perhaps
he
may
swallow
it
well
enough
;
yet
,
when
people
come
to
be
near
their
end
(
as
who
can
venture
to
foretel
what
will
be
the
lady
's
case
?

<EOS>
they
ought
to
take
care
not
to
overburthen
their
conscience
.
<EOS>
I
hope
the
lady
's
case
will
not
be
find
murder
;
for
I
be
sure
I
always
wish
well
to
all
my
prisoner
who
shew
themselves
to
be
gentleman
or
gentlewoman
;
yet
one
should
always
fear
the
bad

"
indeed
,
sir

you
speak
like
an
oracle

answer
the
lady
;

and
one
subornation
of
perjury
would
sit
heavier
on
my
conscience
than
twenty
such
murder
as
I
be
guilty
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
to

sure
,
madam

"
answer
the
keeper
,
"
nobody
can
pretend
to
tell
what
provocation
you
must

have

and
certainly
it
can
never

imagine
that
a
lady
who
behave
herself
so
handsomely
as
you
have
do
ever
since
you
have

Mr.

at

Miss

remind
her

relate
to
her
what
have
befall
him

,
and
Mr.
Booth
and
the

leave
alone

he
proceed
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
since
you
desire
,
madam

to
know
the
particular
of
my
courtship
to
that
good
and
dearest
of
woman
whom
I
afterwards
marry
,
I
will
endeavour
to
recollect
them
as
well
as
I
can
,
at
least
all
those
incident
which
be
most
worth
relate
to
you

<EOS>
"
if
the
vulgar
opinion
of
the
fatality
in
marriage
have
ever
any
foundation
,
it
surely
appear
in
my
marriage
with
my
Amelia
.
<EOS>
I
know
her
in
the
first
dawn
of
her
beauty
;
and
,
I
believe
,
madam
,
she
have
as
much
as
ever
fall
to
the
share
of
a
woman
;
but
,
though
I
always
admire
her
,
it
be
long
without
any
spark
of
love
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
general
admiration
which
at
that
time
pursue
her
,
the
respect
pay
her
by
person
of
the
high
rank
,
and
the
numberless
address
which
be
make
her
by
man
of
great
fortune
,
prevent
my
aspiring
at
the
possession
of
those
charm
which
seem
so
absolutely
out
of
my
reach
.
<EOS>
however
it
be
,
I
assure
you
the
accident
which
deprive
her
of
the
admiration
of
other
make
the
first
great
impression
on
my
heart
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
the
injury
do
to
her
beauty
by
the
overturning
of
a
chaise
,
by
which
,
as
you
may
well
remember
,
her
lovely
nose
be
beat
all
to
piece
,
give
me
an
assurance
that
the
woman
who
have
be
so
much
adore
for
the
charm
of
her
person
deserve
a
much
high
adoration
to
be
pay
to
her

for
that
she
be
in
the
latter
respect
infinitely
more
superior
to
the
rest
of
her
sex

she
have
ever

<EOS>

torrent

from
his

thus

<EOS>
Would

that
the
misfortune
of
my
Amelia
be
capable
of
any
aggravation

<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
she
hath
often
tell
me
it
be
aggravate
with
a
circumstance
which
outweigh
all
the
other
ingredient
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
cruel
insult
she
receive
from
some
of
her
most
intimate
acquaintance

several

whom
,
after
many
distortion
and
grimace

have
turn
their
head
aside
,
unable
to
support
their
secret
triumph

and
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
in
her
hearing

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven

cry
Miss
Matthews

"
what
detestable
action
will
this
contemptible
passion

envy
prevail

an
occasion

this
kind

as
she
hath
since
tell
me
,
make
the
first
impression
on
her
gentle
heart
in
my
favour

<EOS>
I
be
one
day
in
company
with
several
young
lady
,
or
rather
young
devil
,
where
poor
Amelia
's
accident
be
the
subject
of
much
mirth
and
pleasantry

of
these

she

would
not

her
head
so
high
for
the

I

I
be
convinced

never

up
her
nose

<EOS>
another
cry
,
"
what
a
very
proper
match
may
now
be
make
between
Amelia
and
a
certain
captain
,

who
have
unfortunately
receive
an
injury
in
the

part
,

from
no
shameful
cause

many
other
sarcasm
be
throw
out

very
unworthy
to

repeat

<EOS>
I
be
hurt
with
perceive
so
much
malice
in
human
shape
,
and
cry
out
very
bluntly
,
indeed
,
lady
,
you
need
not
express
such
satisfaction
at
poor
Miss
Emily
's
accident
;
for
she
will
still
be
the
handsome
woman
in
England
.
<EOS>
this
speech
of
mine
be
afterwards
variously
repeat
,
by
some
to
my
honour
,
and
by
other
represent
in
a
contrary
light
;
indeed
,
it
be
often
report
to
be
much
ruder
than
it
be
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
at
length
reach
Amelia
's
ear

<EOS>
She
say
she
be
very
much
oblige
to
me
,
since
I
could
have
so
much
compassion
for
her
as
to
be
rude
to
a
lady
on
her
account

<EOS>
"
about
a
month
after
the
accident
,
when
Amelia
begin
to
see
company
in
a
mask
,
I
have
the
honour
to
drink
tea
with
her
.

We
be
alone
together

I
beg
her
to
indulge
my
curiosity

show
me
her
face

She
answer
in
a
most
obliging
manner

perhaps
,
Mr.
Booth
,
you
will
as
little
know
me
when
my
mask
be
off
as
when
it
be
on
;

at
the

instant
unmask

surgeon

skill

thousand
tender

I
be
unable

contain
myself

eagerly
kiss
her
hand

I
cry
 
upon
my
soul

never
appear
to
me
so
lovely

instant

nothing
more
remarkable

at

visit

I
sincerely
believe
we
be
neither
of

hereafter
indifferent
to

many
month
,
however
,
pass
after
this
,
before
I
ever
think
seriously
of
make
her
my
wife
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
want
sufficient
love
for
Amelia
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
arise
from
the
vast
affection
I
bear
her
.
<EOS>
I
consider
my
own
as
a
desperate
fortune
,
her
as
entirely
dependent
on
her
mother
,
who
be
a
woman
,
you
know
,
of
violent
passion
,
and
very
unlikely
to
consent
to
a
match
so
highly
contrary
to
the
interest
of
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
love
Amelia
,
the
more
firmly
I
resolve
within
myself
never
to
propose
love
to
her
seriously
.
<EOS>
such
a
dupe
be
my
understanding
to
my
heart
,
and
so
foolishly
do
I
imagine
I
could
be
master
of
a
flame
to
which
I
be
every
day
add
fuel
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
,
Miss
Matthews
!
<EOS>
we
have
hear
of
man
entirely
master
of
their
passion
,
and
of
heart
which
can
carry
this
fire
in
them
,
and
conceal
it
at
their
pleasure
.
<EOS>
perhaps
there
may
be
such
:
<EOS>
but
,
if
there
be
,
those
heart
may
be
compare
,
I
believe
,
to
damps
,
in
which
it
be
more
difficult
to
keep
fire
alive
than
to
prevent
its
blazing
:
in
mine
it
be
place
in
the
midst
of
combustible
matter

"
after
several
visit
,
in
which
look
and
sigh
have
be
interchange
on
both
side
,
but
without
the
least
mention
of
passion
in
private
,
one
day
the
discourse
between
us
when
alone
happen
to
turn
on
love
;
I
say
happen
,
for
I
protest
it
be
not
design
on
my
side

I
be
as
firmly
convinced
not
on
hers

<EOS>
I
be
now
no
longer
master
of
myself
;
I
declare
myself
the
most
wretched
of
all
martyr
to
this
tender
passion

that
I
have
long
conceal
it
from
its
object

at

mention
many
particular
,
suppress

those
which
must

necessarily
bring
it
home

with
beg

be
the
confidante

to
give
me
her
advice

occasion

I
shall
never

the
dear
perturbation

appear
all
confusion
at
this
instant

<EOS>
She
tremble
,
turn
pale
,

discover
how
well
she
understand
me

by
a
thousand
more
symptom
than
I
could
take
notice
of
,
in
a
state
of
mind

so
very
little
different
from

at
last
,
with
faltering
accent
,
she
say
I
have
make
a
very
ill
choice
of
a
counsellor
in
a
matter
in
which
she
be
so
ignorant

<EOS>
add
,
at
last
,
"
I
believe
,
Mr.
Booth
,
you
gentleman
want
very
little
advice

I
will
relate
no

tire
you

many
particular

no

she
;

should
be
glad

hear
every

tender

Mr.
Booth
continue
his
story
.
<EOS>
in
this
chapter
there
be
some
passage
that
may
serve
as
a
kind
of
touchstone
by
which
a
young
lady
may
examine
the
heart
of
her
lover
.
<EOS>
I
would
advise
,
therefore
,
that
every
lover
be
oblige
to
read
it
over
in
the
presence
of
his
mistress
,
and
that
she
carefully
watch
his
emotion
while
he
be
read
.
 
<EOS>

I
be
under
the
utmost
concern

Booth
,
"
when
I
retire
from
my
visit
,
and
have
reflect
coolly
on
what
I
have
say
.
<EOS>
I
now
see
plainly
that
I
have
make
downright
love
to
Amelia
;
and
I
fear
,
such
be
my
vanity

that
I
have
already
go
too
far

be
too
successful

I

need
give
yourself

describe

easily
guess

be
honest
with

I
do
not
agree

opinion

a
superior
understanding

occasion

nor
be
there
one
article
in
the
whole
science
which
be
not
understand
by
all
our
sex
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
however
,
madam
,
"
say
Mr.
Booth
,
"
I
now
undertake
to
deceive
Amelia
.
<EOS>
I
abstain
three
day
from
see
her
;
to
say
the
truth
,
I
endeavour
to
work
myself
up
to
a
resolution
of
leave
her
for
ever
:
<EOS>
but
when
I
could
not
so
far
subdue
my
passion
 
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
talk
nonsense
of
subdue
passion
?
 
<EOS>
I
should
say
,
when
no
other
passion
could
surmount
my
love
,
I
return
to
visit
her
;
and
now
I
attempt
the
strange
project
which
ever
enter
into
the
silly
head
of
a
lover
.
<EOS>
this
be
to
persuade
Amelia
that
I
be
really
in
love
in
another
place
,
and
have
literally
express
my
meaning
when
I
ask
her
advice
and
desire
her
to
be
my
confidante
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
therefore
forge
a
meeting
to
have
be
between
me
and
my
imaginary
mistress
since
I
have
last
see
Amelia
,
and
relate
the
particular
,
as
well
as
I
could
invent
them
,
which
have
pass
at
our
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Amelia
presently
swallow
this
bait
;
and
,
as
she
hath
tell
me
since
,
absolutely
believe
me
to
be
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
poor
dear
love
!
<EOS>
how
should
the
sincerest
of
heart
have
any
idea
of
deceit
?
<EOS>
for
,
with
all
her
simplicity
,
I
assure
you
she
be
the
most
sensible
woman
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
highly
generous
and
good
in
you
,
"
say
Miss
Matthews
,
with
a
sly
sneer
,
"
to
impute
to
honesty
what
other
would
,
perhaps
,
call
credulity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
protest
,
madam
,
"
answer
he
,
"
I
do
her
no
more
than
justice
.
<EOS>
a
good
heart
will
at
all
time
betray
the
good
head
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
madam
,
my
angel
be
now
,
if
possible
,
more
confused
than
before
.
<EOS>
She
look
so
silly
<EOS>
,
you
can
hardly
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
I
can
,
"
answer
the
lady
,
with
a
laugh
,
"
I
can
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
after
some
hesitation
,
"
cry
he
,
"
my
Amelia
say
faintly
to
me
,
"
Mr.
Booth
,
you
use
me
very
ill
;
you
desire
me
to
be
your
confidante
,
and
conceal
from
me
the
name
of
your
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
possible
then
,
madam
,
"
answer
I
,
"
that
you
can
not
guess
her
,
when
I
tell
you
she
be
one
of
your
acquaintance
,
and
live
in
this
town
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
My
acquaintance
!
"
say
she
:
"
La
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
 
<EOS>
in
this
town
!
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
have
guess
for
once
;
but
I
have
an
ill
talent
that
way
 
I
will
never
attempt
to
guess
anything
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
her
an
injury
when
I
pretend
to
represent
her
manner
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
,
look
,
voice
,
everything
be
inimitable
;
such
sweetness
,
softness
,
innocence
,
modesty
!
 
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
,
if
ever
man
could
boast
of
his
resolution
,
I
think
I
may
now
,
that
I
abstain
from
fall
prostrate
at
her
foot
,
and
adore
her
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
triumph
;
pride
,
I
believe
,
triumph
,
or
perhaps
love
get
the
well
of
love
.
<EOS>
We
once
more
parted
,
and
I
promise
,
the
next
time
I
see
her
,
to
reveal
the
name
of
my
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
have
,
I
think
,
gain
a
complete
victory
over
myself
;
and
no
small
compliment
do
I
pay
to
my
own
resolution
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
triumph
as
coward
and
niggard
do
when
they
flatter
themselves
with
have
give
some
suppose
instance
of
courage
or
generosity
;
and
my
triumph
last
as
long
;
that
be
to
say
,
till
my
ascendant
passion
have
a
proper
opportunity
of
display
itself
in
its
true
and
natural
colour
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
hitherto
succeed
so
well
in
my
own
opinion
,
and
obtain
this
mighty
self
-
conquest
,
I
now
entertain
a
design
of
exert
the
most
romantic
generosity
,
and
of
cure
that
unhappy
passion
which
I
perceive
I
have
raise
in
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
among
the
lady
who
have
express
the
great
satisfaction
at
my
Amelia
's
misfortune
,
Miss
Osborne
have
distinguish
herself
in
a
very
eminent
degree
;
she
be
,
indeed
,
the
next
in
beauty
to
my
angel
,
nay
,
she
have
dispute
the
preference
,
and
have
some
among
her
admirer
who
be
blind
enough
to
give
it
in
her
favour
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
cry
the
lady
,
"
I
will
allow
you
to
call
them
blind
;
but
Miss
Osborne
be
a
charming
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
certainly
be
handsome
,
"
answer
he
,
"
and
a
very
considerable
fortune
;
<EOS>
so
I
think
my
Amelia
would
have
little
difficulty
in
believe
me
when
I
fix
on
her
as
my
mistress
.
<EOS>
and
I
conclude
that
my
thus
place
my
affection
on
her
know
enemy
would
be
the
sure
method
of
eradicate
every
tender
idea
with
which
I
have
be
ever
honour
by
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
to
Amelia
I
go
;
she
receive
me
with
more
than
usual
coldness
and
reserve
;
in
which
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
there
appear
to
me
more
of
anger
than
indifference
,
and
more
of
dejection
than
of
either
.
<EOS>
after
some
short
introduction
,
I
revive
the
discourse
of
my
amour
,
and
presently
mention
Miss
Osborne
as
the
lady
whose
name
I
have
conceal
;
add
,
that
the
true
reason
why
I
do
not
mention
her
before
be
,
that
I
apprehend
there
be
some
little
distance
between
them
,
which
I
hope
to
have
the
happiness
of
accommodate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Amelia
answer
with
much
gravity
,
"
if
you
know
,
sir
,
that
there
be
any
distance
between
us
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
you
know
the
reason
of
that
distance
;
and
then
,
I
think
,
I
could
not
have
expect
to
be
affront
by
her
name
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
think
,
Mr.
Booth
,
that
I
hate
Miss
Osborne
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
Heaven
be
my
witness
,
I
despise
her
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
when
I
reflect
how
much
I
love
the
woman
who
hath
treat
me
so
cruelly
,
I
own
it
give
me
pain
 
<EOS>
when
I
lie
,
as
I
then
imagine
,
and
as
all
about
me
believe
,
on
my
deathbed
,
in
all
the
agony
of
pain
and
misery
,
to
become
the
object
of
laughter
to
my
dear
friend
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
Mr.
Booth
,
it
be
a
cruel
reflection
!
<EOS>
and
could
I
after
this
have
expect
from
you
 
<EOS>
but
why
not
from
you
,
to
whom
I
be
a
person
entirely
indifferent
,
if
such
a
friend
could
treat
me
so
barbarously
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
during
the
great
part
of
this
speech
the
tear
stream
from
her
bright
eye
.
<EOS>
I
could
endure
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
I
catch
up
the
word
indifferent
,
and
repeat
it
,
say
,
do
you
think
then
,
madam
,
that
Miss
Emily
be
indifferent
to
me
?
  
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
surely
,
I
do
,
"
answer
she
:
"
<EOS>
I
know
I
be
;
indeed
,
why
should
I
not
be
indifferent
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
my
eye
,
"
say
I
,
"
then
declare
nothing
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
o
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
of
your
eye
<EOS>
"
answer
she
;
"
your
tongue
hath
declare
that
you
have
single
out
of
all
womankind
my
great
,
I
will
say
,
my
basest
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
once
think
that
character
would
have
be
no
recommendation
to
you
;
 
but
<EOS>
why
do
I
think
so
?
<EOS>
I
be
bear
to
deceive
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
then
fall
on
my
knee
before
her
;
and
,
force
her
hand
,
cry
out
,
o
,
my
Amelia
!
<EOS>
I
can
bear
no
longer
.
<EOS>
You
be
the
only
mistress
of
my
affection
;
you
be
the
deity
I
adore
.
<EOS>
in
this
stile
I
run
on
for
above
two
or
three
minute
,
what
it
be
impossible
to
repeat
,
till
a
torrent
of
contend
passion
,
together
with
the
surprize
,
overpower
her
gentle
spirit
,
and
she
faint
away
in
my
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
describe
my
sensation
till
she
return
to
herself
be
not
in
my
power

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
,
"
cry
Miss
Matthews
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
happy
Amelia
!
<EOS>
why
have
I
not
be
bless
with
such
a
passion
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
convinced
,
madam
,
"
continue
he
,
"
you
can
not
expect
all
the
particular
of
the
tender
scene
which
ensue
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
enough
in
my
sense
to
remember
it
all
.
<EOS>
let
it
suffice
to
say
,
that
that
behaviour
with
which
Amelia
,
while
ignorant
of
its
motive
,
have
be
so
much
displeased
,
when
she
become
sensible
of
that
motive
,
prove
the
strong
recommendation
to
her
favour
,
and
she
be
pleased
to
call
it
generous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
generous
!
"
repeat
the
lady
,
"
and
so
it
be
,
almost
beyond
the
reach
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
I
question
whether
you
ever
have
an
equal
.
"
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
critical
reader
may
have
the
same
doubt
with
Miss
Matthews
;
and
lest
he
should
,
we
will
here
make
a
gap
in
our
history
,
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
accurately
consider
whether
this
conduct
of
Mr.
Booth
be
natural
or
no
;
and
consequently
,
whether
we
have
,
in
this
place
,
maintain
or
deviate
from
that
strict
adherence
to
universal
truth
which
we
profess
above
all
other
historian
.
    
<EOS>
the
narrative
continue
.
<EOS>
More
of
the
touchstone
.
 
<EOS>
Booth
make
a
proper
acknowledgment
of
Miss
Matthew
's
civility
,
and
then
renew
his
story
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
upon
the
footing
of
lover
;
and
Amelia
throw
off
her
reserve
more
and
more
,
till
at
length
<EOS>
I
find
all
that
return
of
my
affection
which
the
tender
lover
can
require
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
situation
would
now
have
be
a
paradise
,
have
not
my
happiness
be
interrupt
with
the
same
reflection
I
have
already
mention
;
have
I
not
,
in
short
,
conclude
,
that
I
must
derive
all
my
joy
from
the
almost
certain
ruin
of
that
dear
creature
to
whom
I
should
owe
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
thought
haunt
me
night
and
day
,
till
I
at
last
grow
unable
to
support
it
:
I
therefore
resolve
in
the
strong
manner
,
to
lay
it
before
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
evening
then
,
after
the
high
profession
of
the
most
disinterested
love
,
in
which
Heaven
know
my
sincerity
,
I
take
an
occasion
to
speak
to
Amelia
in
the
follow
manner
:
    
<EOS>
"
too
true
it
be
,
I
be
afraid
,
my
dear
creature
,
that
the
high
human
happiness
be
imperfect

<EOS>
how
rich
would
be
my
cup
,
be
it
not

one
poisonous
drop

embitter
the
whole

Amelia

what
must
be
the
consequence

my
ever
have
the
honour

call
you
mine

<EOS>
You
know
my
situation
in
life

you
know
your
own

I
have
nothing
more
than
the
poor
provision
of
an
ensign
's
commission
to
depend
on
;
your
sole
dependence
be
on
your
mother

should
any
act
of
disobedience
defeat
your
expectation

wretched
must
your
lot
be
with
me

Amelia

how
ghastly
an
object
to
my
mind
be
the
apprehension
of
your
distress

Can
I
bear
to
reflect
a
moment
on
the
certainty
of
your
foregoing
all
the
convenience
of
life

<EOS>
on
the
possibility

your
suffering

myself

what
then

must
I
leave
you
to
starve
alone

Our

buzz
all
over

it
come
at

to
the
ear
of
Mrs.
Harris

<EOS>
I
have

observe
of
late
a
great
alteration
in
that
lady

behaviour
towards
me
whenever
I
visit
at

house

nor

I

for

ever
obtain
a
private
interview
with
Amelia
;
and
now
,
it
seem
,
I
owe
it
to
her
mother
's
intention
of
overhear
all
that
pass
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
the
period
then
above
mention
,
Mrs.
Harris
burst
from
the
closet
where
she
have
hide
herself
,
and
surprise
her
daughter
,
recline
on
my
bosom
in
all
that
tender
sorrow
I
have
just
describe
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
attempt
to
paint
the
rage
of
the
mother
,
or
the
daughter
's
confusion
,
or
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
here
be
very
fine
doing
,
indeed
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Harris
:
"
you
have
make
a
noble
use
,
Amelia
,
of
my
indulgence
,
and
the
trust
I
repose
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
you
,
Mr.
Booth
,
I
will
not
accuse
you
;
you
have
use
my
child
as
I
ought
to
have
expect
;
I
may
thank
myself
for
what
hath
happen
;
"
with
much
more
of
the
same
kind
,
before
she
would
suffer
me
to
speak
;
but
at
last
I
obtain
a
hearing
,
and
offer
to
excuse
my
poor
Amelia
,
who
be
ready
to
sink
into
the
earth
under
the
oppression
of
grief
,
by
take
as
much
blame
as
I
could
on
myself
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Harris
answer
,
"
no
,
sir
,
I
must
say
you
be
innocent
in
comparison
of
her
;
nay
,
I
can
say
I
have
hear
you
use
dissuasive
argument
;
and
I
promise
you
they
be
of
weight
.
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
,
I
thank
Heaven
,
one
dutiful
child
,
and
I
shall
henceforth
think
her
my
only
one

<EOS>
She
then
force
the
poor
,
tremble
,
faint
Amelia
out
of
the
room
;
which
when
she
have
do
,
she
begin
very
coolly
to
reason
with
me
on
the
folly
,
as
well
as
iniquity
,
which
I
have
be
guilty
of
;
and
repeat
to
me
almost
every
word
I
have
before
urge
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
in
fine
,
she
at
last
obtain
of
me
a
promise
that
I
would
soon
go
to
my
regiment
,
and
submit
to
any
misery
rather
than
that
of
be
the
ruin
of
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
,
for
many
day
,
endure
the
great
torment
which
the
human
mind
be
,
I
believe
,
capable
of
feeling
;
and
I
can
honestly
say
I
try
all
the
mean
,
and
apply
every
argument
which
I
could
raise
,
to
cure
me
of
my
love
.
<EOS>
and
to
make
these
the
more
effectual
,
I
spend
every
night
in
walk
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
sight
of
Mrs.
Harris
's
house
,
where
I
never
fail
to
find
some
object
or
other
which
raise
some
tender
idea
of
my
lovely
Amelia
,
and
almost
drive
me
to
distraction

"
and
do
not
you
think
,
sir

"
say
Miss
Matthews
,
"
you
take
a
most
preposterous
method
to
cure
yourself

<EOS>
"
alas

madam

answer
he
,
"
you
can
not
see
it
in
a
more
absurd
light

I
do

little

grief
who
do
not

how
much
we
deceive
ourselves

some
distemper

serve

heighten
the
disease

at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
,
when
I

drive
almost
to
the
high
degree
of
despair

could
contrive
no
method

convey
a
letter
to
Amelia

be
I
surprised
when
Mrs.

servant
bring
me
a
card

with
an
invitation
from
the
mother
herself
to
drink
tea
that
evening
at

house

You
will
easily
believe
,
madam

that
I
do
not
fail
so
agreeable
an
appointment
:
on
my
arrival
I
be
introduce
into
a
large
company
of
man

Mrs.

my
Amelia

company

Amelia
seem
in
my
eye
to
look
more
beautiful
than
ever
,
and
behave
with
all
the
gaiety
imaginable

the
old
lady
treat
me
with
much
civility

but
the
young
lady
take
little
notice
of
me

address
most
of
her
discourse
to
another
gentleman
present

<EOS>
indeed
,
she
now

then
give
me
a
look
of
no
discouraging
kind

I
observe
her
colour
change
more
than
once
when
her
eye
meet
mine

circumstance

which
,
perhaps
,
ought
to
have
afford
me
sufficient
comfort

they
could
not
allay
the
thousand
doubt

fear
with
which
I
be
alarm

my
anxious
thought
suggest
no

to
me

that
Amelia
have
make
her
peace
with
her
mother
at
the
price
of
abandon
me
forever
,

of
give
her
ear
to
some
other
lover

all
my
prudence
now
vanish
at

I
would
that

have
gladly
run
away
with
Amelia

have
marry
her
without
the

consideration
of
any
consequence

with
such
thought
I
have
torment
myself
for
near
two
hour
,

most
of
the
company
have
take
their
leave

this
I
be
myself
incapable

away

reach

I
will
be
very
plain
with
you

<EOS>
I
advise
her
to
take
all
possible
care

the
young
lady

even
to
send
her
to
some
place

out

remain

say
I

that
this
be

preserve

I

no

inform
me

he

him
all
which
have
happen
the
evening
before

indeed

she
must
have
an
excellent
memory

for
I
think
she
repeat
every
word
I
say
,

add
,
that
she

be
come
to
Mrs.
Harris
's
,
and
that
the
whole
town
say
he
be
shortly
to
be
married
to
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
soon
perceive
how
much
superior
my
love
for
Amelia
be
to
every
other
passion
;
poor
Nancy
's
idea
disappear
in
a
moment
;
I
quit
the
dear
lifeless
corpse
,
over
which
I
have
shed
a
thousand
tear
,
leave
the
care
of
her
funeral
to
other
,
and
post
,
I
may
almost
say
flew
,
back
to
Amelia
,
and
alight
at
the
doctor
's
house
,
as
he
have
desire
me
in
his
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
good
man
presently
acquaint
me
with
what
have
happen
in
my
absence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Winckworth
have
,
it
seem
,
arrive
the
very
day
of
my
departure
,
with
a
grand
equipage
,
and
,
without
delay
,
have
make
formal
proposal
to
Mrs.
Harris
,
offer
to
settle
any
part
of
his
vast
estate
,
in
whatever
manner
she
please
,
on
Amelia
.
<EOS>
these
proposal
the
old
lady
have
,
without
any
deliberation
,
accept
,
and
have
insist
,
in
the
most
violent
manner
,
on
her
daughter
's
compliance
,
which
Amelia
have
as
peremptorily
refuse
to
give
;
insist
,
on
her
part
,
on
the
consent
which
her
mother
have
before
give
to
our
marriage
,
in
which
she
be
heartily
second
by
the
doctor
,
who
declare
to
her
,
as
he
now
do
to
me
,
"
that
we
ought
as
much
to
be
esteem
man
and
wife
as
if
the
ceremony
have
already
past
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
these
remonstrance
,
the
doctor
tell
me
,
have
work
no
effect
on
Mrs.
Harris
,
who
still
persist
in
her
avow
resolution
of
marry
her
daughter
to
Winckworth
,
whom
the
doctor
have
likewise
attack
,
tell
him
that
he
be
pay
his
address
to
another
man
's
wife
;
but
all
to
no
purpose
;
the
young
gentleman
be
too
much
in
love
to
hearken
to
any
dissuasive
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
now
enter
into
a
consultation
what
mean
to
employ
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
earnestly
protest
against
any
violence
to
be
offer
to
the
person
of
Winckworth
,
which
,
I
believe
,
I
have
rashly
threaten
;
declare
that
,
if
I
make
any
attempt
of
that
kind
,
he
would
for
ever
abandon
my
cause
.
<EOS>
I
make
him
a
solemn
promise
of
forbearance
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
determine
to
pay
another
visit
to
Mrs.
Harris
,
and
,
if
he
find
her
obdurate
,
he
say
he
think
himself
at
liberty
to
join
us
together
without
any
further
consent
of
the
mother
,
which
every
parent
,
he
say
,
have
a
right
to
refuse
,
but
not
retract
<EOS>
when
give
,
unless
the
party
himself
,
by
some
conduct
of
his
,
give
a
reason
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
doctor
have
make
his
visit
with
no
well
success
than
before
,
the
matter
now
debate
be
,
how
to
get
possession
of
Amelia
by
stratagem
,
for
she
be
now
a
close
prisoner
than
ever
;
be
her
mother
's
bedfellow
by
night
,
and
never
out
of
her
sight
by
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
while
we
be
deliberate
on
this
point
a
wine
-
merchant
of
the
town
come
to
visit
the
doctor
,
to
inform
him
that
he
have
just
bottle
off
a
hogshead
of
excellent
old
port
,
of
which
he
offer
to
spare
him
a
hamper
,
say
that
he
be
that
day
to
send
in
twelve
dozen
to
Mrs.
Harris
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
doctor
now
smile
at
a
conceit
which
come
into
his
head
;
and
,
take
me
aside
,
ask
me
if
I
have
love
enough
for
the
young
lady
to
venture
into
the
house
in
a
hamper
.
<EOS>
I
joyfully
leapt
at
the
proposal
,
to
which
the
merchant
,
at
the
doctor
's
intercession
,
consent
;
for
I
believe
,
madam
,
you
know
the
great
authority
which
that
worthy
mart
have
over
the
whole
town
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
moreover
,
promise
to
procure
a
license
,
and
to
perform
the
office
for
us
at
his
house
,
if
I
could
find
any
mean
of
convey
Amelia
thither
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
this
hamper
,
then
,
I
be
carry
to
the
house
,
and
deposit
in
the
entry
,
where
I
have
not
lain
long
before
I
be
again
remove
and
pack
up
in
a
cart
in
order
to
be
send
five
mile
into
the
country
;
for
I
hear
the
order
give
as
I
lie
in
the
entry
;
and
there
I
likewise
hear
that
Amelia
and
her
mother
be
to
follow
me
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
unload
from
my
cart
,
and
set
down
with
the
rest
of
the
lumber
in
a
great
hall
.
<EOS>
here
I
remain
above
three
hour
,
impatiently
wait
for
the
evening
,
when
I
determine
to
quit
a
posture
which
be
become
very
uneasy
,
and
break
my
prison
;
but
Fortune
contrive
to
release
me
sooner
,
by
the
follow
mean
:
the
house
where
I
now
be
have
be
leave
in
the
care
of
one
maid
-
servant
.
<EOS>
this
faithful
creature
come
into
the
hall
with
the
footman
who
have
drive
the
cart
.
<EOS>
a
scene
of
the
high
fondness
have
past
between
them
,
the
fellow
propose
,
and
the
maid
consent
,
to
open
the
hamper
and
drink
a
bottle
together
,
which
,
they
agree
,
their
mistress
would
hardly
miss
in
such
a
quantity
.
<EOS>
They
presently
begin
to
execute
their
purpose
.
<EOS>
They
open
the
hamper
,
and
,
to
their
great
surprise
,
discover
the
content
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
an
immediate
advantage
of
the
consternation
which
appear
in
the
countenance
of
both
the
servant
,
and
have
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
improve
the
knowledge
of
those
secret
to
which
I
be
privy
.
<EOS>
I
tell
them
that
it
entirely
depend
on
their
behaviour
to
me
whether
their
mistress
should
ever
be
acquaint
,
either
with
what
they
have
do
or
with
what
they
have
intend
to
do
;
for
that
if
they
would
keep
my
secret
I
would
reciprocally
keep
theirs
.
<EOS>
I
then
acquaint
them
with
my
purpose
of
lie
conceal
in
the
house
,
in
order
to
watch
an
opportunity
of
obtain
a
private
interview
with
Amelia
.

in
the
situation
in
which
these
two
delinquent
stand

you
may
be
assure
it
be
not
difficult
for
me
to
seal
up
their
lip

<EOS>
in
short
,
they
agree
to
whatever
I
propose
.
<EOS>
I
lie
that
evening
in
my
dear
Amelia

bedchamber

be
in
the
morning

into

garret

I
be
to

Amelia
(

the
maid

on

arrival

you
bring

a
foolish
story

after

well
,
madam

after
a
lecture

about

I
suffer
her
to
conduct

to
the
outward
gate

court

yard

whence
<EOS>
I
set
forward
in
a
disconsolate
condition
of
mind
towards
my
lodging

I
have
five
mile
to
walkin
a
dark
and
rainy
night

how
can
I
mention
these
trifling
circumstance
as
any
aggravation

disappointment

I
assure
you
,
madam

answer
Booth

"
I
have
often
wonder
at
it
myself
;
but
my
spirit
be
so
much
sink
at
the
sight
of
her
mother
,
that
no
man
be
ever
a
great
coward
than
I
be
at
that
instant
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
believe
my
tender
concern
for
the
terror
of
Amelia
be
the
principal
cause
of
my
submission

<EOS>
however
it
be
,
I
leave
the
house

and
walk
about
a
hundred
yard
,
when
,
at
the
corner
of
the
garden
-
wall
,
a
female
voice

in
a
whisper

cry
out
,
"
Mr.
Booth

<EOS>
"
the
person
be
extremely
near
me

it
be
so
dark
I
could
scarce
see
her
;
nor
do
I
,
in
the
confusion
I
be
in
,
immediately
recognize
the
voice
.
<EOS>
I
answer
in
a
line
of
Congreve
's
,
which
burst
from
my
lip
spontaneously
;
for
I
be
sure
I
have
no
intention

quote
play
at

time

"
who
call
the
wretched
thing
that
be
Alphonso

a
woman
leapt
into

cry
out

it
be
indeed
my
Alphonso

my
only
Alphonso

<EOS>
o
Miss

<EOS>
guess
what
I
feel
when
I
find
I
have
my
Amelia
in
my
arm

<EOS>
I
embrace
her
with
an
ecstasy
not
to
be
describe
,
at
the
same
instant
pour
a
thousand
tenderness
into
her
ear
;
at
least
,
if
I
could
express
so
many
to
her
in
a
minute
,
for
in
that
time
the
alarm
begin
at
the
house
;
Mrs.
Harris
have
mist
her
daughter
,
and
the
court
be
presently
full
of
light
and
noise
of
all
kind
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
lift
Amelia
over
a
gate
,
and
,
jump
after
<EOS>
,
we
creep
along
together
by
the
side
of
a
hedge
,
a
different
way
from
what
lead
to
the
town
,
as
I
imagine
that
would
be
the
road
through
which
they
would
pursue
us
.
<EOS>
in
this
opinion
I
be
right
;
for
we
hear
them
pass
along
that
road
,
and
the
voice
of
Mrs.
Harris
herself
,
who
run
with
the
rest
,
notwithstanding
the
darkness
and
the
rain
.
<EOS>
by
these
mean
we
luckily
make
our
escape
,
and
clambre
over
hedge
and
ditch
,
my
Amelia
perform
the
part
of
a
heroine
all
the
way
,
we
at
length
arrive
at
a
little
green
lane
,
where
stand
a
vast
spread
oak
,
under
which
we
shelter
ourselves
from
a
violent
storm
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
this
be
over
and
the
moon
begin
to
appear
,
Amelia
declare
she
know
very
well
where
she
be
;
and
,
a
little
farther
strike
into
another
lane
to
the
right
,
she
say
that
would
lead
us
to
a
house
where
we
should
be
both
safe
and
unsuspected
.
<EOS>
I
follow
her
direction
,
and
we
at
length
come
to
a
little
cottage
about
three
mile
distant
from
Mrs.
Harris
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
it
now
rain
very
violently
,
we
enter
this
cottage
,
in
which
we
espy
a
light
,
without
any
ceremony
.
<EOS>
here
we
find
an
elderly
woman
sit
by
herself
at
a
little
fire
,
who
have
no
sooner
view
us
than
she
instantly
spring
from
her
seat
,
and
start
back
give
the
strong
token
of
amazement
;
upon
which
Amelia
say
,
"
be
not
surprised
,
nurse
,
though
you
see
me
in
a
strange
pickle
,
I
own
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
old
woman
,
after
have
several
time
bless
herself
,
and
express
the
most
tender
concern
for
the
lady
who
stand
drip
before
her
,
begin
to
bestir
herself
in
make
up
the
fire
;
at
the
same
time
entreat
Amelia
that
she
may
be
permit
to
furnish
her
with
some
cloath
,
which
,
she
say
,
though
not
fine
,
be
clean
and
wholesome
and
much
dryer
than
her
own
.
<EOS>
I
second
this
motion
so
vehemently
,
that
Amelia
,
though
she
declare
herself
under
no
apprehension
of
catch
cold
(
she
hath
indeed
the
good
constitution
in
the
world
)
,
at
last
consent
,
and
I
retire
without
door
under
a
shed
,
to
give
my
angel
an
opportunity
of
dress
herself
in
the
only
room
which
the
cottage
afford
belowstair
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
my
return
into
the
room
,
Amelia
insist
on
my
exchange
my
coat
for
one
which
belong
to
the
old
woman
's
son
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
,
"
cry
Miss
Matthews
,
"
to
find
she
do
not
forget
you
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
think
it
somewhat
cruel
to
turn
you
out
into
the

ejaculation

my

Miss

Miss

I

know
nothing

Amelia

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

good
!

if

the

I
hope
he

you
would
deserve
it
all

<EOS>
but
why
do
I
attempt
to
mimic
the
honest
creature

<EOS>
in
short
,
she
discover
the
great
affection
for
my
Amelia
;
with
which
I
be
much
more
delighted
than
I
be
offend
at
the
suspicion
she
shew
of

the
many
bitter
curse
which
she
denounce
against
me

if
I
ever
prove
a
bad
husband

so
sweet
a
young

<EOS>

I
so
well
improve
the
hint
give
me
by
Amelia
,
that
the
old
woman
have
no
doubt
of
our
be
really
married

comfort
herself
that
,
if
it
be
not

well

it
may
have
be

madam
have
enough
for
us

that
happiness

not

on
great
rich

rail
at

have
turn
us
out

door

I
scarce
tell
an
untruth

when
Amelia
say
,
"
She
hope
her
nurse
would
not
betray
her

the
good

answer
with
much
warmth

<EOS>
betray
you

no

that
I

the
good

then
go
out
and
fetch
a
chicken
from
the
roost
,
which
she
kill
,
and
begin
to
pick
,
without
ask
any

<EOS>
then

summon
her
son

who
be
in
bed

to
her
assistance

she
begin
to
prepare
this
chicken
for
our
supper

<EOS>
this
she
afterwards
set
before
us
in
so
neat
,
I
may
almost
say
elegant
,
a
manner
,
that
whoever
would
have
disdain
it
either
doth
not
know
the
sensation

doth
not

it

Our
food
be
attend
with
some
ale

our
kind
hostess
say
she
intend
not

tap
till
Christmas

add
she

I

<EOS>

for
my

no

then
an
object
of
envy
to
me

even
Amelia

to
be
in
pretty
good

softly

there
may

happiness

Miss

Booth

the
good
woman
begin
to
think
of
our
further
want

very
earnestly
recommend
her
bed
to
us
,
say
,
it
be
a
very
neat
,
though
homely
one
,
and
that
she
could
furnish
us
with
a
pair
of
clean
sheet
.
<EOS>
She
add
some
persuasive
which
paint
my
angel
all
over
with
vermilion
.
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
I
behave
so
awkwardly
and
foolishly
,
and
so
readily
agree
to
Amelia
's
resolution
of
sit
up
all
night
,
that
,
if
it
do
not
give
the
nurse
any
suspicion
of
our
marriage
,
it
ought
to
have
inspire
her
with
the
utmost
contempt
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
both
endeavour
to
prevail
with
nurse
to
retire
to
her
own
bed
,
but
find
it
utterly
impossible
to
succeed
;
she
thank
Heaven
<EOS>
she
understand
breed
better
than
that
.
<EOS>
and
so
well
breed
be
the
good
woman
,
that
we
could
scarce
get
her
out
of
the
room
the
whole
night

<EOS>
luckily
for
us
,
we
both
understand
French
,
by
mean
of
which
we
consult
together
,
even
in
her
presence
,
upon
the
measure
we
be
to
take
in
our
present
exigency

<EOS>
at
length
it
be
resolve
that
I
should
send
a
letter
by
this
young
lad
,
whom
I
have
just
before
mention
,
to
our
worthy
friend
the
doctor
,
desire
his
company
at
our
hut
,
since
we
think
it
utterly
unsafe
to
venture
to
the
town
,
which
we
know
would
be
in
an
uproar
on
our
account
before
the
morning

<EOS>
here
Booth
make
a
full
stop
,
smile
,
and
then
say
he
be
go
to
mention
so
ridiculous
a
distress

that
he
could
scarce

of
it
without
laugh

this

the
reader

know

chapter

some
of

to
tell
you
we

nor

in
our

exigency

<EOS>
"
a
verbal
message
be
now
our
only
resource

however
,
we
contrive
to
deliver
it
in
such
term
,
that
neither
nurse
nor
her
son
could
possibly
conceive
any
suspicion
from
it
of
the
present
situation
of
our
affair
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Amelia
whisper
me
,
I
may
safely
place
any
degree
of
confidence
in
the
lad
;
for
he
have
be
her
foster
-
brother
,
and
she
have
a
great
opinion
of
his
integrity
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
truth
a
boy
of
very
good
natural
part
;
and
Dr
Harrison
,
who
have
receive
him
into
his
family
,
at
Amelia
's
recommendation
,
have
breed
him
up
to
write
and
read
very
well
,
and
have
take
some
pain
to
infuse
into
him
the
principle
of
honesty
and
religion

He
be
not

indeed

even
now
discharge
from
the
doctor

have
be
at
home
with
his
mother

some
time

on
account
of
the
small

pox

from
which
he
be
lately
recover

<EOS>
"
I
have
say
so
much
,

continue
Booth
,
"
of
the
boy
's
character

that
you
may
not

surprised
at
some
story

him
hereafter

go
now

one
of

strange

such
a

We
be
now
impatiently
expect
the
arrival
of
the
doctor

have
be
go
much
more
than
a
sufficient
time

to

you
may
be

appear
not

when
nurse

out

turn
pale
as
death
at

I
fear
she
would
have
faint

if
I
could
be

to
fear

who
have
scarce
any
of
my
sense

be
in
a
condition
little
well

my
angel

"
while
we
be
both
in
this
dreadful
situation

Amelia
fall
back
in
her
chair
with
the
countenance
in
which
ghost
be
paint
,
myself
at
her
foot

with
a
complexion
of
no

different
colour

out

water

enter
the
room

at
the
sight
of
this
scene
she
throw
herself
likewise
into
a
chair

call
immediately
for
a
glass
of
water

which
Miss
Betty
her
daughter
supply
her
with

as
to

nothing

make
any
impression

her
whilst
she
apprehend
her
young
mistress
to

in
danger

"
the
doctor
have
now
enter
the
room
,
and
,
come
immediately
up
to
Amelia
,
after
some
expression
of
surprize
,
he
take
her
by
the
hand
,
call
her
his
little
sugar
-
plum
,
and
assure
her
there
be
none

friend
present

He
then
lead
her
tottering
across
the
room
to
Mrs.

Amelia
then
fall
upon
her
knee
before
her
mother

but
the
doctor
catch
her
up
,
say
,
"
use
that
posture
,
child
,
only
to
the
Almighty

<EOS>
but
I
need
not
mention
this
singularity
of
his
to
you
who
know
him
so
well
,

must
have
hear
him
often
dispute
against
address
ourselves
to
man
in
the
humblest
posture

we
use
towards
the
Supreme
Being

<EOS>
"
I
will
tire
you
with
no
more
particular

<EOS>
we
be
soon
satisfied
that
the
doctor
have
reconcile
us

our
affair
to
Mrs.

proceed
directly
to
church

where
be
the
strange
accident

indeed

answer
he
,
"
your
reproof
be
just

I
have
like
to
have
forget
it

you
can
not
wonder
at
me

you
reflect
on
that
interesting
part

before

accident

must
tell
you
what
happen

escape
from

Mrs.
Harris
at
first
run
out
into
the
lane
among
her
servant

pursue
us
(
so
she
imagine
)
along
the
road
lead
to
the
town

but
that
be
very
dirty
,
and
a
violent
storm
of
rain
come

she
take
shelter
in
an
alehouse
about
half
a
mile
from

together

usual
privy
counsellor

all
her

They
sit
up
all
night
together

the
doctor
endeavour
,
by
argument
and
persuasion
,
to
bring
Mrs.
Harris
to
reason
;
but
all
to
no
purpose
,
though
,
as
he
hath
inform
me
,
Miss
Betty
second
him
with
the
warm
entreaty

<EOS>
here
Miss
Matthews
laugh
;
of
which
Booth
beg
to
know
the
reason

she
,
at
last
,
after
many
apology
,
say
,
"
It
be
the
first
good
thing
she
ever
hear
of
Miss
Betty

nay

she
,
"
and
ask
your
pardon
for
my
opinion
of
your
sister

since
you
will
have
it

I
always
conceive
her
to
be
the
deep

hypocrite

<EOS>
Booth
fetch
a
sigh
,
and
say
he
be
afraid
she
have
not
always
act
so
kindly
;
 
and
then
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
proceed
:
  
"
You
will
be
pleased
,
madam
,
to
remember
the
lad

a
verbal
message

message
be
no
more

to
desire
the
favour

that
he

fulfil
his

no

she
fall
into
the
most
violent
passion
imaginable

be

of
have
confederate

carry
off

who
have
hitherto
use
only

talk
in

confess

that
,
since
Mrs.
Harris
herself
have
make
him
an
agent
in
this
matter

he
would
take
care
to
acquit
himself
with
honour

add

Miss
Matthews

on
your
conquest
of

so
kind
to
say

enquire
into
my
character

find
that
I
have
be
a
dutiful
son

an
affectionate
brother

whoever

He

with
say
that
Amelia

happiness

her
heart

nay
,
her
very
reputation

be
all
concerned

this
matter

as
he

be
make
instrumental

he

resolve

carry
her
through
it

take
the
licence
from
his
pocket
,
declare
to
Mrs.
Harris
that
he
would
go
that
instant
and
marry
her
daughter

this
speech

the
doctor
's
voice

his
look

his
behaviour

be
sufficiently
calculate
to
inspire
awe

even
terror

when
he

frighten
poor
Mrs.
Harris

work
a
more
sensible
effect
than
it
be
in
his
power
to
produce
by
all
his
argument

entreaty

I
have
already
relate
what
follow

thus
the
strange
accident
of
our
wanting

our
not
trust

our
secret

occasion
the
discovery

that
discovery
put
the
doctor
upon

that
blessed
event

I

nothing

well

you
now

me
married

in
which
situation
you
will

perhaps
,
think
my
happiness
incapable
of
addition

<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
so
;

yet
I
can
with
truth
say
that
the
love

be
not
comparable

I

half
the
misery

<EOS>
that
we
may
give
the
reader
leisure
to
consider
well
the
foregoing
sentiment

we
will
here
put
an
end
to
this
chapter

in
which
our
reader
will
probably
be
divide
in
their
opinion
of
Mr.
Booth
's
conduct

<EOS>
Booth
proceed
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
"
the
first
month
of
our
marriage
produce
nothing
remarkable
enough
to
mention
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
need
not
tell
Miss
Matthews
that
I
find
in
my
Amelia
every
perfection
of
human
nature
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Harris
at
first
give
us
some
little
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
She
have
rather
yield
to
the
doctor
than
give
a
willing
consent
to
the
match
;
however
,
by
degree
,
she
become
more
and
more
satisfied
,
and
at
last
seem
perfectly
reconcile
.
<EOS>
this
we
ascribe
a
good
deal
to
the
kind
office
of
Miss
Betty
,
who
have
always
appear
to
be
my
friend
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
greatly
assist
to
Amelia
in
make
her
escape
,
which
I
have
no
opportunity
of
mention
to
you
before
,
and
in
all
thing
behave
so
well
,
outwardly
at
least
,
to
myself
as
well
as
her
sister
,
that
we
regard
her
as
our
sincere
friend

<EOS>
"
about
half
a
year
after
our
marriage
two
additional
company
be
add
to
our
regiment
,
in
one
of
which
I
be
prefer
to
the
command
of
a
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
upon
this
occasion
Miss
Betty
give
the
first
intimation
of
a
disposition
which
we
have
since
too
severely
experienced
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
servant
,
sir
,
"
say
Miss
Matthews
;
"
then
I
find
I
be
not
mistake
in
my
opinion
of
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
shew
me
any
goodness
in
a
censorious
prude
,
and
"
  
as
Miss
Matthews
hesitate
for
a
simile
or
an
execration
,
Booth
proceed
:
"
You
will
please
to
remember
,
madam
,
there
be
formerly
an
agreement
between
myself
and
Mrs.
Harris
that
I
should
settle
all
my
Amelia
's
fortune
on
her
,
except
a
certain
sum
,
which
be
to
be
lay
out
in
my
advancement
in
the
army
;
but
,
as
our
marriage
be
carry
on
in
the
manner
you
have
hear
,
no
such
agreement
be
ever
execute
.
<EOS>
and
since
I
be
become
Amelia
's
husband
not
a
word
of
this
matter
be
ever
mention
by
the
old
lady
;
and
as
for
myself
,
I
declare
I
have
not
yet
awaken
from
that
delicious
dream
of
bliss
in
which
the
possession
of
Amelia
have
lull
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Miss
Matthews
sigh
,
and
cast
the
tender
of
look
on
Booth
,
who
thus
continue
his
story
:
    
"
soon
after
my
promotion
Mrs.
Harris
one
morning
take
an
occasion
to
speak
to
me
on
this
affair
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
that
,
as
I
have
be
promote
gratis
to
a
lieutenancy
,
she
would
assist
me
with
money
to
carry
me
yet
a
step
higher
;
and
,
if
more
be
require
than
be
formerly
mention
,
it
should
not
be
want
,
since
she
be
so
perfectly
satisfied
with
my
behaviour
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
add
that
she
hope
I
have
still
the
same
inclination
to
settle
on
my
wife
the
remainder
of
her
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
answer
with
very
warm
acknowledgment
of
my
mother
's
goodness
,
and
declare
,
if
I
have
the
world
,
I
be
ready
to
lay
it
at
my
Amelia
's
foot
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
Heaven
know
,
<EOS>
I
would
ten
thousand
world

<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Harris
seem
pleased
with
the
warmth
of
my
sentiment
,
and
say
she
would
immediately
send
to
her
lawyer
and
give
him
the
necessary
order
;
and
thus
end
our
conversation
on
this
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
from
this
time
there
be
a
very
visible
alteration
in
Miss
Betty
's
behaviour
.
<EOS>
She
grow
reserve
to
her
sister
as
well
as
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
be
fretful
and
captious
on
the
slight
occasion
;
nay
,
she
affect
much
to
talk
on
the
ill
consequence
of
an
imprudent
marriage
,
especially
before
her
mother
;
and
if
ever
any
little
tenderness
or
endearment
escape
me
in
public
towards
Amelia
,
she
never
fail
to
make
some
malicious
remark
on
the
short
duration
of
violent
passion
;
and
,
when
I
have
express
a
fond
sentiment
for
my
wife
,
her
sister
would
kindly
wish
she
may
hear
as
much
seven
year
hence
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
these
matter
have
be
since
suggest
to
us
by
reflection
;
for
,
while
they
actually
past
,
both
Amelia
and
myself
have
our
thought
too
happily
engage
to
take
notice
of
what
discover
itself
in
the
mind
of
any
other
person
.
  
<EOS>
"
unfortunately
for
us
,
Mrs.
Harris
's
lawyer
happen
at
this
time
to
be
at
London
,
where
business
detain
him
upwards
of
a
month
,
and
,
as
Mrs.
Harris
would
on
no
occasion
employ
any
other
,
our
affair
be
under
an
entire
suspension
till
his
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Amelia
,
who
be
now
big
with
child
,
have
often
express
the
deep
concern
at
her
apprehension
of
my
be
some
time
command
abroad
;
a
circumstance
,
which
she
declare
if
it
should
ever
happen
to
her
,
even
though
she
should
not
then
be
in
the
same
situation
as
at
present
,
would
infallibly
break
her
heart
.
<EOS>
these
remonstrance
be
make
with
such
tenderness
,
and
so
much
affect
me
,
that
,
to
avoid
any
probability
of
such
an
event
,
I
endeavour
to
get
an
exchange
into
the
horse
-
guard
,
a
body
of
troop
which
very
rarely
go
abroad
,
unless
where
the
king
himself
command
in
person
.
<EOS>
I
soon
find
an
officer
for
my
purpose
,
the
term
be
agree
on
,
and
Mrs.
Harris
have
order
the
money
which
I
be
to
pay
to
be
ready
,
notwithstanding
the
opposition
make
by
Miss
Betty
,
who
openly
dissuade
her
mother
from
it
;
alledge
that
the
exchange
be
highly
to
my
disadvantage
;
that
I
could
never
hope
to
rise
in
the
army
after
it
;
not
forget
,
at
the
same
time
,
some
insinuation
very
prejudicial
to
my
reputation
as
a
soldier
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
everything
be
agree
on
,
and
the
two
commission
be
actually
make
out
,
but
not
sign
by
the
king

one
day
,
at
my
return
from
hunting

Amelia
fly
to
me
,
and
eagerly
embrace
me
,
cry
out

"
<EOS>
o
Billy
,
I
have
news
for
you
which
delight
my
soul

<EOS>
nothing
sure
be
ever
so
fortunate
as
the
exchange
you
have
make
.
<EOS>
the
regiment
you
be
formerly
in
be
order
for
Gibraltar

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
receive
this
news
with
far
less
transport
than
it
be
deliver
.
<EOS>
I
answer
coldly
,
since
the
case
be
so
,
I
heartily
hope
the
commission
may
be
both
sign
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
reply
Amelia
eagerly
;
"
sure
you
tell
me
everything
be
entirely
settle

<EOS>
that
look
of
yours
frighten
me
to
death

"
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
run
into
too
minute
particular
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
receive
a
letter
by
that
very
post
from
the
officer
with
whom
I
have
exchange
,
insist
that
,
though
his
majesty
have
not
sign
the
commission
,
that
still
the
bargain
be
valid
,
partly
urge
it
as
a
right
,
and
partly
desire
it
as
a
favour
,
that
he
may
go
to
Gibraltar
in
my
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
letter
convince
me
in
every
point
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
inform
that
the
commission
be
not
sign
,
and
consequently
that
the
exchange
be
not
compleate
;
of
consequence
the
other
could
have
no
right
to
insist
on
go
;
and
,
as
for
grant
him
such
a
favour
,
I
too
clearly
see
I
must
do
it
at
the
expense
of
my
honour
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
reduce
to
a
dilemma
,
the
most
dreadful
which
I
think
any
man
can
experience
;
in
which
,
I
be
not
ashamed
to
own
,
I
find
love
be
not
so
overmatche
by
honour
as
he
ought
to
have
be
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
leave
Amelia
in
her
present
condition
to
misery
,
perhaps
to
death
or
madness
,
be
insupportable
;
nor
could
any
other
consideration
but
that
which
now
torment
me
on
the
other
side
have
combat
them
a
moment

Miss
Matthews

can
despise
want
of
spirit
in

more

myself

I
can
not
help

rather
too
nice

Booth

doth
nothing

leave
anything
undone

if
the
conflict
be
so
terrible
with
myself
alone

what
be
my
situation
in

Amelia

could
I
support

sigh

tear

agony

despair

you

prison

use
so
little
ceremony
at
his
approach

the
bolt

very
slight

give
way

have
no

enter
the
room

he
acquaint
Miss
Matthews
that
he
have
bring
her
very
good
news

for
which

demand
a
bottle
of
wine

demand
be
comply

acquaint
Miss
Matthews
that
the
wound
gentleman
be
not
dead
,
nor
be
his
wound
think
to
be
mortal

<EOS>
that
loss
of
blood

his
fright

indifferent
as
to
the

<EOS>
"
all
I

be
,
that
if

instead

she
beg
the

to
leave

alone
with
Mr.
Booth

<EOS>
the
keeper
reply
,
"
Nay
,
madam
,
perhaps
it
may
be
well
to
stay
a
little
longer
here
,
if
you
have
not
bail
ready
,
than
to
buy

too
dear

besides
,
a
day

two
hence

when

past
all

to
be
sure
some
folk
that
would
expect
an
extraordinary
fee
now
can
not
expect
to
touch
anything
.
<EOS>
and
to
be
sure
you
shall
want
nothing
here
.
<EOS>
the
good
of
all
thing
be
to
be
have
here
for
money
,
both
eatable
and
drinkable
:
though
I
say
it
,
I
shall
not
turn
my
back
to
any
of
the
tavern
for
either
eatable
or
wind

<EOS>
the
captain
there
need
not

be
so
shy
of
own
himself
when
he
first
come
in

we
have
have
captain
and
other
great
gentleman
here
before
now

and
no
shame
to
them

I
say
it

<EOS>
many
a

"
  
<EOS>
"
I

a

discomposed

that

<EOS>

"
and
I
honour
you
the
more
for
it

<EOS>
I
love
the
gentleman
of
the
army

<EOS>
I
be
in
the
army
myself
formerly
;
in
the
Lord
of
Oxford

horse

<EOS>
It
be
true
I
ride
private
;
but
I
have
money
enough
to
have
buy
in
quarter

master
,
when
I
take
it
into
my
head
to
marry

and
my
wife
she
do
not
like
that
<EOS>
I
should
continue
a
soldier
,
she
be
all
for
a
private
life
;
and
so
I
come
to
this
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
sir
,
"
answer
Booth
,
"
you
consult
your
wife
's
inclination
very
notably
;
but
pray
will
you
satisfy
my
curiosity
in
tell
me
how
you
become
acquainted
that
I
be
in
the
army

<EOS>
for
my
dress
I
think
could
not
betray
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Betray
!
"
reply
the
keeper
;
"
there
be
no
betraying
here
,
I
hope
 
I
be
not
a
person
to
betray
people
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
be
so
shy
and
peery
<EOS>
,
you
would
almost
make
one
suspect
there
be
more
in
the
matter

and
if
there
be

I
promise
you

you
need
not

tell

You

give
you

<EOS>
informer
be
odious

there
be
no
doubt
of
that
,

no
one
would
care
to
be
an
informer
if
he
could
help
it
,
because
of
the
ill
-
usage
they
always
receive
from
the
mob
:
yet
it
be
dangerous
to
trust
too
much
;
and
when
safety
and
a
good
part
of
the
reward
too
be
on
one
side

gallow
on

peery

I

to

after
some
token
of
amazement

cry
out

well

captain

I
must
say
you

<EOS>
however

I
will
tell

this
:
the

Mr.

have
be
lay
their

together
about

above
half
an
hour
this

<EOS>
I
overhear

Captain

,
for
my

,
I
would
not
answer
that
Mr.

go
about
the
business
;
but
if
you
will
impeach
any
to
me
of
the
road
,
or
anything
else
,
I
will
step
away
to
his

Thrasher
this

I

I
have
interest
enough
with
him

get
you

so

you

no

the

go

there
be
many
bad

in

may
be

when
they

I
know
no

It

be
many
a

man

much
honour

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir

"
say
Booth
,
"
I
assure
you
I
be
not
that
gentleman
of
honour
you
imagine
me

"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matthews
,
who
have
long
understand
the
keeper
no
better
than
Mr.
Booth
,
no
sooner
hear
his
meaning
explain
than
she
be
fire
with
great
indignation
than
the
gentleman
have
express
.
<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
,
sir
,
"
say
she
to
the
keeper
,
"
insult
a
man
of
fashion
,
and
who
hath
have
the
honour
to
bear
his
majesty
's
commission
in
the
army
?
<EOS>
as
you
yourself
own
you
know

<EOS>
if
his
misfortune
have
send
him
hither
,
sure
we
have
no
law
that
will
protect
such
a

you
in
insult
him

"
<EOS>
"
Fellow
!
"
<EOS>
mutter
the
keeper
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
advise
you
,
madam

to
use
such
language
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
dare
threaten
me
?
"
reply
Miss
Matthews
in
a
rage
.
"
<EOS>
venture
in
the
least
instance
to
exceed
your
authority
with
regard
to
me
,
and
I
will
prosecute
you
with
the
utmost
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
scene
of
very
high
altercation
now
ensue
,
till
Booth
interpose
and
quiet
the
keeper
,
who
be
,
perhaps
,
enough
incline
to
an
accommodation
;
for
,
in
truth
,
he
wage
unequal
war
.
<EOS>
He
be
besides
unwilling
to
incense
Miss
Matthews
,
whom
he
expect
to
be
bail
out
the
next
day
,
and
who
have
more
money
leave
than
he
intend
she
should
carry
out
of
the
prison
with
her
;
and
as
for
any
violent
or
unjustifiable
method
,
the
lady
have
discover
much
too
great
a
spirit
to
be
in
danger
of
them
.
<EOS>
the
governor
,
therefore
,
in
a
very
gentle
tone
,
declare
that
,
if
he
have
give
any
offence
to
the
gentleman
,
he
heartily
ask
his
pardon
;
that
,
if
he
have
know
him
to
be
really
a
captain
,
he
should
not
have
entertain
any
such
suspicion
;
but
the
captain
be
a
very
common
title
in
that
place
,
and
belong
to
several
gentleman
that
have
never
be
in
the
army
,
or
,
at
most
,
have
rid
private
like
himself
.
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
captain
,
"
say
he
,
"
as
you
yourself
own
,
your
dress
be
not
very
military
"
(
for
he
have
on
a
plain
fustian
suit
)
;
"
and
besides
,
as
the
lawyer
say
,
noscitur
a
sosir
,
be
a
very
good
rule
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
believe
there
be
a
great
rascal
upon
earth
than
that
same
Robinson
that
I
be
talk
of
.
<EOS>
nay
,
I
assure
you
,
I
wish
there
may
be
no
mischief
hatching
against
you
.
<EOS>
but
if
there
be
I
will
do
all
I
can
with
the
lawyer
to
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
Mr.
Murphy
be
one
of
the
clever
man
in
the
world
at
the
law
;
that
even
his
enemy
must
own
,
and
as
I
recommend
him
to
all
the
business
I
can
(
and
it
be
not
a
little
to
be
sure
that
arise
in
this
place
)
,
why
one
good
turn
deserve
another
.
<EOS>
and
I
may
expect
that
he
will
not
be
concern
in
any
plot
to
ruin
any
friend
of
mine
,
at
least
when
I
desire
him
not
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
could
not
be
an
honest
man
if
he
would
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
then
satisfy
that
Mr.
Robinson
,
whom
he
do
not
yet
know
by
name
,
be
the
gamester
who
have
win
his
money
at
play
.
<EOS>
and
now
Miss
Matthews
,
who
have
very
impatiently
bear
this
long
interruption
,
prevail
on
the
keeper
to
withdraw
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
be
go
Mr.
Booth
begin
to
felicitate
her
upon
the
news
of
the
wound
gentleman
be
in
a
fair
likelihood
of
recovery
.
<EOS>
to
which
,
after
a
short
silence
,
she
answer
,
"
there
be
something
,
perhaps
,
which
you
will
not
easily
guess
,
that
make
your
congratulation
more
agreeable
to
me
than
the
first
account
I
hear
of
the
villain

have
escape
the
fate
he
deserve
;
for
I
do
assure
you
,
at
first
,
it
do
not
make
me
amend
for
the
interruption
of
my
curiosity

<EOS>
now
I
hope
we
shall
be
disturb
no
more
till
you
have
finish
your
whole
story
.
 
<EOS>
You
leave
off
,
I
think
,
somewhere
in
the
struggle
about
leave
Amelia
 
the
happy
Amelia

and
can
you
call
her
happy
at
such
a
period

<EOS>
cry
Booth

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
happy
,
ay
,
happy
,
in
any
situation
,
"
answer
Miss
Matthews
,
"
with
such
a
husband
.
<EOS>
I
,
at
least
,
may
well
think
so
,
who
have
experience
the
very
reverse
of
her
fortune
;
but
I
be
not
bear
to
be
happy
.
<EOS>
I
may
say
with
the
poet
,
      
"
the
black
ink
of
fate
be
sure
my
lot
,
     
<EOS>
and
when
fate
writ
my

it
make
a
blot
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
dear
Miss
Matthews

"
answer
Booth
,
"
you
must
and
shall
banish
such
gloomy
thought

fate
hath

I
hope

many
happy

do
you

Mr.

reply
she
;

indeed
you
know
the
contrary
 
you
must
know

you
can
not

forget

<EOS>
no

quite
obliterate

forgetfulness

I
have
reason

I
know
not

I
be
say

<EOS>
Pray
do
proceed
in
that
story

"
  
<EOS>
Booth
so
immediately
comply
with
this
request
that
it
be
possible
he
be
pleased
with
it
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
if
all
which
unwittingly
dropt
from
Miss
Matthews
be
put
together
,
some
conclusion
may
,
it
seem
,
be
draw
from
the
whole
,
which
could
not
convey
a
very
agreeable
idea
to
a
constant
husband
.
<EOS>
Booth
,
therefore
,
proceed
to
relate
what
be
write
in
the
third
book
of
this
history
.
    
<EOS>
BOOK
III
.
 
<EOS>
in
which
Mr.
Booth
resume
his
story
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
madam
,
"
continue
Booth
,
"
I
be
just
go
to
acquaint
you
with
the
doctor
's
opinion
when
we
be
interrupt
by
the
keeper
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
doctor
,
have
hear
counsel
on
both
side
,
that
be
to
say
,
Mrs.
Harris
for
my
staying
,
and
Miss
Betty
for
my
going
,
at
last
deliver
his
own
sentiment
.
<EOS>
as
for
Amelia
,
she
sit
silent
,
drown
in
her
tear
;
nor
be
I
myself
in
a
much
well
situation
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
as
the
commission
be
not
sign
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
I
think
you
may
be
say
to
remain
in
your
former
regiment
;
and
therefore
I
think
you
ought
to
go
on
this
expedition
;
your
duty
to
your
king
and
country
,
whose
bread
you
have
eat
,
require
it
;
and
this
be
a
duty
of
too
high
a
nature
to
admit
the
least
deficiency
.
<EOS>
regard
to
your
character
,
likewise
,
require
you
to
go
;
for
the
world
,
which
may
justly
blame
your
staying
at
home
if
the
case
be
even
fairly
state
,
will
not
deal
so
honestly
by
you
:
<EOS>
you
must
expect
to
have
every
circumstance
against
you
heighten
,
and
most
of
what
make
for
your
defence
omit
;
and
thus
you
will
be
stigmatize
as
a
coward
without
any
palliation
.
<EOS>
as
the
malicious
disposition
of
mankind
be
too
well
known
,
and
the
cruel
pleasure
which
they
take
in
destroy
the
reputation
of
other
,
the
use
we
be
to
make
of
this
knowledge
be
to
afford
no
handle
to
reproach
;
for
,
bad
as
the
world
be
,
it
seldom
fall
on
any
man
who
hath
not
give
some
slight
cause
for
censure
,
though
this
,
perhaps
,
be
often
aggravate
ten
thousand
-
fold
;
and
,
when
we
blame
the
malice
of
the
aggravation
we
ought
not
to
forget
our
own
imprudence
in
give
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
remember
,
my
boy
,
your
honour
be
at
stake
;
and
you
know
how
nice
the
honour
of
a
soldier
be
in
these
case
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
treasure

we
will
,
accord
to
our
usual
custom

accommodate
ourselves
to
every

place
this

the
thread
of

a
scene
of
the
tender
kind

<EOS>
"
the
doctor
,
madam
,
"
continue
Booth
,
"
spend
his
evening
at
Mrs.
Harris
's
house
,
where
I
sit
with
him
whilst
<EOS>
he
smoake
his
pillow
pipe
,
as
his
phrase
be
.
<EOS>
Amelia
be
retire
about
half
an
hour
to
her
chamber
before
I
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
at
my
entrance
I
find
her
on
her
knee
,
a
posture
in
which
I
never
disturb
her
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
she
arise
,
come
to
me
,
and
embrace
me
,
say
she
have
be
pray
for
resolution
to
support
the
cruell
moment
she
have
ever
undergo
or
could
possibly
undergo
.
<EOS>
I
remind
her
how
much
more
bitter
a
farewel
would
be
on
a
death
-
bed
,
when
we
never
could
meet
,
in
this
world
at
least
,
again
.
<EOS>
I
then
endeavour
to
lessen
all
those
object
which
alarm
her
most
,
and
particularly
the
danger
I
be
to
encounter
,
upon
which
head
I
seem
a
little
to
comfort
her
;
but
the
probable
length
of
my
absence
and
the
certain
length
of
my
voyage
be
circumstance
which
no
oratory
of
mine
could
even
palliate
.
"
<EOS>
o
heavens
!
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
burst
into
tear
,
"
can
I
bear
to
think
that
hundred
,
thousand
for
aught
I
know
,
of
mile
or
league
,
that
land
and
sea
be
between
us
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
prospect
from
that
mount
in
our
garden
where
I
have
sit
so
many
happy
hour
with
my
Billy
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
distance
between
that
and
the
farth
hill
which
we
see
from
thence
compare
to
the
distance
which
will
be
between
us
?
<EOS>
You
can
not
wonder
at
this
idea
;
you
must
remember
,
my
Billy
,
at
this
place
,
this
very
thought
come
formerly
into
my
foreboding
mind
.
<EOS>
I
then
beg
you
to
leave
the
army
.
<EOS>
why
would
you
not
comply
?
 
<EOS>
do
I
not
tell
you
then
that
the
small
cottage
we
could
survey
from
the
mount
would
be
,
with
you
,
a
paradise
to
me
?
<EOS>
it
would
be
so
still
 
<EOS>
why
can
not
my
Billy
think
so
?
<EOS>
be
I
so
much
his
superior
in
love
?
<EOS>
where
be
the
dishonour
,
Billy
?
<EOS>
or
,
if
there
be
any
,
will
it
reach
our
ear
in
our
little
hut
?
<EOS>
be
glory
and
fame
,
and
not
his
Amelia
,
the
happiness
of
my
husband
?
<EOS>
go
then
,
purchase
them
at
my
expence
.
<EOS>
You
will
pay
a
few
sigh
,
perhaps
a
few
tear
,
at
parting
,
and
then
new
scene
will
drive
away
the
thought
of
poor
Amelia
from
your
bosom
;
but
what
assistance
shall
I
have
in
my
affliction
?
<EOS>
not
that
any
change
of
scene
could
drive
you
one
moment
from
my
remembrance
;
yet
here
<EOS>
every
object
I
behold
will
place
your
loved
idea
in
the
lively
manner
before
my
eye
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
bed
in
which
you
have
repose
;
that
be
the
chair
on
which
you
sit

<EOS>
upon
these
board
you
have
stand

these

Can
I
walk
among
our
bed
of
flower
without
view
your
favourite

nay
,
those
which
you
have
plant
with
your
own
hand

<EOS>
can
I
see
one
beauty
from
our
beloved
mount

you
have
not
point
out
to
me

go
on

Miss
Matthews

with
a
smile

I
own
the
same
observation
occur
to
me

It
be

natural

consider
ourselves

Mr.
Booth

shall
I

in
the
danger
and
agony
of
childbirth
,
support
your
absence

"
 
<EOS>
here
she
stopt
,
and
,
look
on
me
with
all
the
tenderness
imaginable
,
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
and
be
I
then
such
a
wretch
to
wish
for
your
presence
at
such
a
season
?
<EOS>
ought
I
not
to
rejoice
that
you
be
out
of
the
hearing
of
my
cry

the
knowledge
of
my
pain
?
<EOS>
if
I
die
,
will
you
not

escape
the
horror
of
a
part
ten
thousand
time
more
dreadful

this

go
,
go

my
Billy

;
the
very
circumstance
which
make
me
most
dread
your
departure
hath
perfectly
reconcile
me
to
it

I
perceive
clearly
now
that
I
be
only
wish
to
support
my
own
weakness
with
your
strength

to
relieve
my
own
pain

the
price
of
yours

me
,

love

I
be
ashamed
of
myself

<EOS>
I
catch
her
in
my
arm
with
rapture
not
to
be
expr
in
word
,
call
her
my
heroine
;
sure
none
ever
better
deserve
that
name
;
after
which
we
remain
for
some
time
speechless
,
and
lock
in
each
other
's
embrace

<EOS>
"
I
be
convince
,

Miss
Matthews

with
a
sigh
,
"
there
be
moment
in
life
worth
purchase
with
world

<EOS>
"
at
length
the
fatal
morning
come
.
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
hide
every
pang
of
my
heart
,

to
wear
the
utmost
gaiety
in
my
countenance
.
<EOS>
Amelia
act
the
same
part
.
<EOS>
in
these
assume
character
we
meet
the
family
at
breakfast
;
at
their
breakfast
,
I
mean
,
for
we
be
both
full
already
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
spend
above
an
hour
that
morning
in
discourse
with
Mrs.
Harris
,
and
have
,
in
some
measure
,
reconcile
her
to
my
departure
.
<EOS>
He
now
make
use
of
every
art
to
relieve
the
poor
distressed
Amelia
;
not
by
inveigh
against
the
folly
of
grief
,
or
by
seriously
advise
her
not
to
grieve
;
both
of
which
be
sufficiently
perform
by
Miss
Betty
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
recourse
to
every
means
which
may
cast
a
veil
over
the
idea
of
grief
,
and
raise
comfortable
image
in
my
angel
's
mind
.
<EOS>
He
endeavour
to
lessen
the
suppose
length
of
my
absence
by
discourse
on
matter
which
be
more
distant
in
time
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
intend
next
year
to
rebuild
a
part
of
his
parsonage
-
house
.
"
<EOS>
and
you
,
captain
,
"
say
he
,
"
shall
lay
the
corner
-
stone
,
I
promise
you
:
"
with
many
other
instance
of
the
like
nature
,
which
produce
,
I
believe
,
some
good
effect
on
us
both
.
  
<EOS>
"
Amelia
speak
but
little
;
indeed
,
more
tear
than
word
dropt
from
her
;
however
,
she
seem
resolve
to
bear
her
affliction
with
resignation
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
dreadful
news
arrive
that
the
horse
be
ready
,
and
I
,
have
take
my
leave
of
all
the
rest
,
at
last
approach
her
,
she
be
unable
to
support
the
conflict
with
nature
any
longer
,
and
,
cling
round
my
neck
,
she
cry
,
"
Farewel
,
farewel
for
ever
;
for
I
shall
never
,
never
see
you
more
.
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
the
blood
entirely
forsook
her
lovely
cheek
,
and
she
become
a
lifeless
corpse
in
my
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Amelia
continue
so
long
motionless
,
that
the
doctor
,
as
well
as
Mrs.
Harris
,
begin
to
be
under
the
most
terrible
apprehension
;
so
they
inform
me
afterwards
,
for
at
that
time
I
be
incapable
of
make
any
observation
.
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
very
little
more
use
of
my
sense
than
the
dear
creature
whom
I
support
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
we
be
all
deliver
from
our
fear
;
and
life
again
visit
the
lovely
mansion
that
human
nature
ever
afford
it
.

"
I
have
be
,
and
yet
be
,
so
terrified
with
what
have
happen
,
and
Amelia
continue
yet
so
weak
and
ill
,
that
I
determine
,
whatever
may
be
the
consequence
,
not
to
leave
her
that
day
;
which
resolution
she
be
no
sooner
acquaint
with
than
she
fall
on
her
knee
,
cry
,
"
Good
Heaven
!
<EOS>
I
thank
thee
for
this
reprieve
at
least
.

oh
!
<EOS>
that
every
hour
of
my

life

into

dear
day

<EOS>
"
Our
good
friend
the
doctor
remain
with
us

<EOS>
He
say
he
have
intend
to
visit
a
family
in
some
affliction
;
"
but
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
he
,
"
why
I
should
ride
a
dozen
mile
after
affliction
,
when
we
have
enough
here
.
<EOS>
"
of
all
mankind
the
doctor
be
the
good
of
comforter
.
<EOS>
as
his
excessive
good
-
nature
make
him
take
vast
delight
in
the
office
,
so
his
great
penetration
into
the
human
mind
,
join
to
his
great
experience
,
render
him
the
most
wonderful
proficient
in
it
;
and
he
so
well
know
when
to
soothe
,
when
to
reason
,
and
when
to
ridicule
,
that
he
never
apply
any
of
those
art
improperly
,
which
be
almost
universally
the
case
with
the
physician
of
the
mind
,
and
which
it
require
very
great
judgment
and
dexterity
to
avoid
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
doctor
principally
apply
himself
to
ridicule
the
danger
of
the
siege
,
in
which
he
succeed
so
well
,
that
he
sometimes
force
a
smile
even
into
the
face
of
Amelia
.
<EOS>
but
what
most
comfort
her
be
the
argument
he
use
to
convince
her
of
the
probability
of
my
speedy
if
not
immediate
return
.
<EOS>
He
say
the
general
opinion
be
that
the
place
would
be
take
before
our
arrival
there
;
in
which
case
we
should
have
nothing
more
to
do
than
to
make
the
good
of
our
way
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Amelia
be
so
lull
by
these
art
that
she
pass
the
day
much
better
than
I
expect
.
<EOS>
though
the
doctor
could
not
make
pride
strong
enough
to
conquer
love
,
yet
he
exalt
the
former
to
make
some
stand
against
the
latter
;
insomuch
that
my
poor
Amelia
,
I
believe
,
more
than
once
flatter
herself
,
to
speak
the
language
of
the
,
world
,
that
her
reason
have
gain
an
entire
victory
over
her
passion
;
till
love
bring
up
a
reinforcement
,
if
I
may
use
that
term
,
of
tender
idea
,
and
bear
down
all
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
evening
the
doctor
and
I
pass
another
half
-
hour
together
,
when
he
propose
to
me
to
endeavour
to
leave
Amelia
asleep
in
the
morning
,
and
promise
me
to
be
at
hand
when
she
awake
,
and
to
support
her
with
all
the
assistance
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
He
add
that
nothing
be
more
foolish
than
for
friend
to
take
leave
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
"
say
he
,
"
in
the
common
acquaintance
and
friendship
of
the
world
,
this
be
a
very
harmless
ceremony
;
but
between
two
person
who
really
love
each
other
the
church
of
Rome
never
invent
a
penance
half
so
severe
as
this
which
we
absurdly
impose
on
ourselves
"
  
"
I
greatly
approve
the
doctor
's
proposal
;
thank
him
,
and
promise
,
if
possible
,
to
put
it
in
execution
.
<EOS>
He
then
shake
me
by
the
hand
,
and
heartily
wish
me
well
,
say
,
in
his
blunt
way
,
"
well
,
boy
,
I
hope
to
see
thee
crown
with
laurel
at
thy
return

one
comfort
I
have
at

that
stone
wall

a
sea

prevent
thee
from
run
away

I
have
leave

repair
to
my
Amelia
,
whom
I
find
in
her
chamber
,
employ
in
a
very
different
manner
from
what
she
have
be
the
precede
night
;
she
be
busy
in
pack
up
some
trinket
in
a
casket
,
which
she
desire
me
to
carry
with
me
.
<EOS>
this
casket
be
her
own
work
,
and
she
have
just
fasten
it
as
I
come
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
eye
very
plainly
discover
what
have
pass
while
she
be
engage
in
her
work
:
however
,
her
countenance
be
now
serene
,
and
she
speak
,
at
least
,
with
some
chearfulness
.
<EOS>
but
after
some
time
,
"
You
must
take
care
of
this
casket
,
Billy
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
,
indeed
,
<EOS>
Billy
 
for
"
here
<EOS>
passion
almost
choake
her
,
till
a
flood
of
tear
give
her
relief
,
and
then
she
proceed
"
for
I
shall
be
the
happy
woman
that
ever
be
bear
when
I
see
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
her
,
with
the
blessing
of
God
,
that
day
would
soon
come
.
"
soon
!
"
answer
she
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
Billy
,
not
soon
:
a
week
be
an
age
;
 
but
yet
the
happy
day
may
come
.
<EOS>
It
shall
,
it
must
,
it
will
!
<EOS>
yes
,
Billy
,
we
shall
meet
never
to
part
again
,
even
in
this
world
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
pardon
my
weakness
,
Miss
Matthews
,
but
upon
my
soul
I
can
not
help
it
,
"
cry
he
,
wipe
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
I
wonder
at
your
patience
,
and
I
will
try
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Amelia
,
tire
out
with
so
long
a
struggle
between
variety
of
passion
,
and
have
not
close
her
eye
during
three
successive
night
,
towards
the
morning
fall
into
a
profound
sleep
.
<EOS>
in
which
sleep
I
leave
her
,
and
,
have
dr
myself
with
all
the
expedition
imaginable
,
singe
,
whistle
,
hurrying
,
attempt
by
every
method
to
banish
think
,
I
mount
my
horse
,
which
I
have
over
-
night
order
to
be
ready
,
and
gallop
away
from
that
house
where
all
my
treasure
be
deposit
.
  
<EOS>
"
thus
,
madam
,
I
have
,
in
obedience
to
your
command
,
run
through
a
scene
which
,
if
it
hath
be
tiresome
to
you
,
you
must
yet
acquit
me
of
have
obtrude
upon
you
.
<EOS>
this
I
be
convince
of
,
that
no
one
be
capable
of
taste
such
a
scene
who
hath
not
a
heart
full
of
tenderness
,
and
perhaps
not
even
then
,
unless
he
hath
be
in
the
same
situation
.
"
    
<EOS>
in
which
Mr.
Booth
set
forward
on
his
journey
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
madam
,
we
have
now
take
our
leave
of
Amelia
.
<EOS>
I
ride
a
full
mile
before
I
once
suffer
myself
to
look
back
;
but
now
be
come
to
the
top
of
a
little
hill
,
the
last
spot
I
know
which
could
give
me
a
prospect
of
Mrs.
Harris
's
house
,
my
resolution
fail
:
I
stop
and
cast
my
eye
backward
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
what
I
feel
at
that
instant
?
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
I
be
not
able
.
<EOS>
so
many
tender
idea
crowd
at
once
into
my
mind
,
that
,
if
I
may
use
the
expression
,
they
almost
dissolve
my
heart
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
madam
,
the
most
unfortunate
accident
come
first
into
my
head
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
that
I
have
in
the
hurry
and
confusion
leave
the
dear
casket
behind
me
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
go
back
at
first
suggest
itself
;
but
the
consequence
of
that
be
too
apparent
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
resolve
to
send
my
man
,
and
in
the
meantime
to
ride
on
softly
on
my
road
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
execute
my
order
,
and
after
some
time
,
feed
my
eye
with
that
delicious
and
yet
heartfelt
prospect
,
I
at
last
turn
my
horse
to
descend
the
hill
,
and
proceed
about
a
hundred
yard
,
when
,
consider
with
myself
that
I
should
lose
no
time
by
a
second
indulgence
,
I
again
turn
back
,
and
once
more
feasted
my
sight
with
the
same
painful
pleasure
till
my
man
return
,
bring
me
the
casket
,
and
an
account
that
Amelia
still
continue
in
the
sweet
sleep
I
leave
her
.
<EOS>
I
now
suddenly
turn
my
horse
for
the
last
time
,
and
with
the
utmost
resolution
pursue
my
journey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
my
man
at
his
return
 
<EOS>
but
before
I
mention
anything
of
him
it
may
be
proper
,
madam
,
to
acquaint
you
who
he
be
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
foster
-
brother
of
my
Amelia
.
<EOS>
this
young
fellow
have
take
it
into
his
head
to
go
into
the
army
;
and
he
be
desirous
to
serve
under
my
command
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
consent
to
discharge
him
;
his
mother
at
last
yield
to
his
importunity
,
and
I
be
very
easily
prevail
on
to
list
one
of
the
handsome
young
fellow
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
easily
believe
I
have
some
little
partiality
to
one
whose
milk
Amelia
have
suck
;
but
,
as
he
have
never
see
the
regiment
,
I
have
no
opportunity
to
shew
him
any
great
mark
of
favour
.
<EOS>
indeed
he
wait
on
me
as
my
servant
;
and
I
treat
him
with
all
the
tenderness
which
can
be
use
to
one
in
that
station
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
be
about
to
change
into
the
horse
-
guard
the
poor
fellow
begin
to
droop
,
fear
that
he
should
no
longer
be
in
the
same
corps
with
me
,
though
certainly
that
would
not
have
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
have
never
mention
one
word
of
his
dissatisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
be
indeed
a
fellow
of
a
noble
spirit
;
but
when
he
hear
that
I
be
to
remain
where
I
be
,
and
that
we
be
to
go
to
Gibraltar
together
,
he
fall
into
transport
of
joy
little
short
of
madness
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
poor
fellow
have
imbibe
a
very
strong
affection
for
me
;
though
this
be
what
I
know
nothing
of
till
long
after
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
he
return
to
me
then
,
as
I
be
say
,
with
the
casket
,
I
observe
his
eye
all
over
blubber
with
tear
.
<EOS>
I
rebuke
him
a
little
too
rashly
on
this
occasion
.
"
<EOS>
Heyday
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
"
what
be
the
meaning
of
this
?
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
not
a
milk
-
sop
with
me
.
<EOS>
if
I
think
you
would
shew
such
a
face
to
the
enemy
I
would
leave
you
behind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
honour
nee
not
fear
that
,
"
answer
he
;
"
I
shall
find
nobody
there
that
I
shall
love
well
enough
to
make
me
cry
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
highly
pleased
with
this
answer
,
in
which
I
think
I
could
discover
both
sense
and
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
then
ask
him
what
have
occasion
those
tear
since
he
have
leave
me
(
for
he
have
no
sign
of
any
at
that
time
)
,
and
whether
he
have
see
his
mother
at
Mrs.
Harris
's
?
<EOS>
He
answer
in
the
negative
,
and
beg
that
I
would
ask
him
no
more
question
;
add
that
he
be
not
very
apt
to
cry
,
and
he
hope
he
should
never
give
me
such
another
opportunity
of
blame
him
.
<EOS>
I
mention
this
only
as
an
instance
of
his
affection
towards
me
;
for
I
never
could
account
for
those
tear
any
otherwise
than
by
place
them
to
the
account
of
that
distress
in
which
he
leave
me
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
We
travel
full
forty
mile
that
day
without
bait
,
when
,
arrive
at
the
inn
where
I
intend
to
rest
that
night
,
I
retire
immediately
to
my
chamber
,
with
my
dear
Amelia
's
casket
,
the
opening
of
which
be
the
nice
repast
,
and
to
which
every
other
hunger
give
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
mention
to
you
all
the
little
matter
with
which
Amelia
have
furnish
this
casket
.
<EOS>
It
contain
medicine
of
all
kind
,
which
her
mother
,
who
be
the
Lady
Bountiful
of
that
country
,
have
supply
her
with
.
<EOS>
the
most
valuable
of
all
to
me
be
a
lock
of
her
dear
hair
,
which
I
have
from
that
time
to
this
wear
in
my
bosom
.
<EOS>
what
would
I
have
then
give
for
a
little
picture
of
my
dear
angel
,
which
she
have
lose
from
her
chamber
about
a
month
before
!
<EOS>
and
which
we
have
the
high
reason
in
the
world
to
imagine
her
sister
have
take
away
;
for
the
suspicion
lie
only
between
her
and
Amelia
's
maid
,
who
be
of
all
creature
the
honest
,
and
whom
her
mistress
have
often
trust
with
thing
of
much
great
value
;
for
the
picture
,
which
be
set
in
gold
,
and
have
two
or
three
little
diamond
round
it
,
be
worth
about
twelve
guinea
only
;
whereas
Amelia
leave
jewel
in
her
care
of
much
great
value
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
sure
,
"
cry
Miss
Matthews
,
"
she
could
not
be
such
a
paultry
pilferer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
on
account
of
the
gold
or
the
jewel
,
"
cry
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
We
impute
it
to
mere
spite
,
with
which
,
I
assure
you
,
she
abound
;
and
she
know
that
,
next
to
Amelia
herself
,
there
be
nothing
which
I
value
so
much
as
this
little
picture
;
for
such
a
resemblance
do
it
bear
of
the
original
,
that
Hogarth
himself
do
never
,
I
believe
,
draw
a
strong
likeness
.
<EOS>
spite
,
therefore
,
be
the
only
motive
to
this
cruel
depredation
;
and
indeed
her
behaviour
on
the
occasion
sufficiently
convince
us
both
of
the
justice
of
our
suspicion
,
though
we
neither
of
us
durst
accuse
her
;
and
she
herself
have
the
assurance
to
insist
very
strongly
(
though
she
could
not
prevail
)
with
Amelia
to
turn
away
her
innocent
maid
,
say
,
she
would
not
live
in
the
house
with
a
thief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matthews
now
discharge
some
curse
on
Miss
Betty
,
not
much
worth
repeat
,
and
then
Mr.
Booth
proceed
in
his
relation
.
    
<EOS>
a
sea
piece
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
next
day
we
join
the
regiment
,
which
be
soon
after
to
embark
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
mirth
and
jollity
be
in
the
countenance
of
every
officer
and
soldier
;
and
as
I
now
meet
several
friend
whom
I
have
not
see
for
above
a
year
before
,
I
pass
several
happy
hour
,
in
which
poor
Amelia
's
image
seldom
obtrude
itself
to
interrupt
my
pleasure
.
<EOS>
to
confess
the
truth
,
dear
Miss
Matthews
,
the
tender
of
passion
be
capable
of
subside
;
nor
be
absence
from
our
dear
friend
so
unsupportable
as
it
may
at
first
appear
.
<EOS>
distance
of
time
and
place
do
really
cure
what
they
seem
to
aggravate
;
and
take
leave
of
our
friend
resemble
take
leave
of
the
world
;
concern
which
it
hath
be
often
say
that
it
be
not
death
,
but
dying
,
which
be
terrible
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Miss
Matthews
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
,
and
cry
,
"
I
sincerely
ask
your
pardon
;
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
help
laugh
at
the
gravity
of
your
philosophy
.
"
<EOS>
Booth
answer
,
that
the
doctrine
of
the
passion
have
be
always
his
favourite
study
;
that
he
be
convince
every
man
act
entirely
from
that
passion
which
be
uppermost
.
"
<EOS>
Can
I
then
think
,
"
say
he
,
"
without
entertain
the
utmost
contempt
for
myself
,
that
any
pleasure
upon
earth
could
drive
the
thought
of
Amelia
one
instant
from
my
mind
?
  
<EOS>
"
at
length
we
embark
aboard
a
transport
,
and
sail
for
Gibraltar
;
but
the
wind
,
which
be
at
first
fair
,
soon
chop
about
;
so
that
we
be
oblige
,
for
several
day
,
to
beat
to
windward
,
as
the
sea
phrase
be
.
<EOS>
during
this
time
the
taste
which
I
have
of
a
seafare
life
do
not
appear
extremely
agreeable
.
<EOS>
We
roll
up
and
down
in
a
little
narrow
cabbin
,
in
which
be
three
officer
,
all
of
us
extremely
sea
-
sick
;
our
sickness
be
much
aggravate
by
the
motion
of
the
ship
,
by
the
view
of
each
other
,
and
by
the
stench
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
but
a
little
taste
indeed
of
the
misery
which
be
to
follow
;
for
we
be
get
about
six
league
to
the
westward
of
Scilly
,
when
a
violent
storm
arise
at
north
-
east
,
which
soon
raise
the
wave
to
the
height
of
mountain
.
<EOS>
the
horror
of
this
be
not
to
be
adequately
describe
to
those
who
have
never
see
the
like
.
<EOS>
the
storm
begin
in
the
evening
,
and
,
as
the
cloud
bring
on
the
night
apace
,
it
be
soon
entirely
dark
;
nor
have
we
,
during
many
hour
,
any
other
light
than
what
be
cause
by
the
jar
element
,
which
frequently
send
forth
flash
,
or
rather
stream
of
fire
;
and
whilst
these
present
the
most
dreadful
object
to
our
eye
,
the
roaring
of
the
wind
,
the
dashing
of
the
wave
against
the
ship
and
each
other
,
form
a
sound
altogether
as
horrible
for
our
ear
;
while
our
ship
,
sometimes
lift
up
,
as
it
be
,
to
the
sky
,
and
sometimes
sweep
away
at
once
as
into
the
low
abyss
,
seem
to
be
the
sport
of
the
wind
and
sea
.
<EOS>
the
captain
himself
almost
give
up
all
for
lost
,
and
expr
his
apprehension
of
be
inevitably
cast
on
the
rock
of
Scilly
,
and
beat
to
piece
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
while
some
on
board
be
address
themselves
to
the
Supreme
Being
,
and
other
apply
for
comfort
to
strong
liquor
,
my
whole
thought
be
entirely
engage
by
my
Amelia
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
tender
idea
croude
into
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
can
truly
say
that
I
have
not
a
single
consideration
about
myself
in
which
she
be
not
concerned
.
<EOS>
die
to
me
be
leave
her
;
and
the
fear
of
never
see
her
more
be
a
dagger
stick
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
again
,
all
the
terror
with
which
this
storm
,
if
it
reach
her
ear
,
must
fill
her
gentle
mind
on
my
account
,
and
the
agony
which
she
must
undergo
when
she
hear
of
my
fate
,
give
me
such
intolerable
pang
,
that
I
now
repent
my
resolution
,
and
wish
,
I
own
I
wish
,
that
I
have
take
her
advice
,
and
preferred
love
and
a
cottage
to
all
the
dazzling
charm

up

his
joy
with

a

unused

would
have
be
astonish
at
the
satisfaction

now
discover
itself

still
rage

violence

the
daylight

now
appear

present
us
with
sight
of
horror
sufficient
to
terrify
mind

be
not
absolute
slave
to
the
passion
of
fear

so
great
be
the
force
of
habit
,
that
what
inspire
a
landsman
with
the
high
apprehension
of
danger
give
not
the

concern
to
a
sailor

to
whom
rock

quicksand
be
almost
the
only
object
of
terror

<EOS>
"
the
master
,
however
,
be
a
little
mistaken
in
the
present
instance
;
for
he
have
not
leave
the
cabbin
above
an
hour
before
my
man
come
run
to
me
,
and
acquaint
me
that
the
ship
be
half
full
of
water
;
that
the
sailor
be
go
to
hoist
out
the
boat
and
save
themselves

beg
me
to
come
that
moment
along
with
him

I
tender
my
preservation

<EOS>
with
this
account

which
be
convey
to
me
in
a
whisper
,
I
acquaint
both
the
captain

we
all
together
immediately
mount
the
deck
,
where
we
find
the
master
make
use
of
all
his
oratory
to
persuade
the
sailor
that
the
ship
be
in
no
danger

at

employ
all
his
authority
to
set
the
pump
a

going

which
he
assure
them
would
keep
the
water
under
,
and
save
his
dear
Lovely
Peggy
(
for
that
be
the
name
of
the
ship

,
<EOS>
which
he
swear
he
love
as
dearly
as
his
own
soul
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
this
sufficiently
appear
;
for
the
leak
be
so
great
,
and
the
water
flow
in
so
plentifully
,
that
his
Lovely
Peggy
be
half
fill
before
he
could
be
bring
to
think
of
quit
her
;
but
now
the
boat
be
bring
alongside
the
ship
,
and
the
master
himself
,
notwithstanding
all
his
love
for
her
,
quit
his
ship
,
and
leapt
into
the
boat
.
<EOS>
every
man
present
attempt
to
follow
his
example
,
when
I
hear
the
voice
of
my
servant
roar
forth
my
name
in
a
kind
of
agony

<EOS>
I
make
directly
to
the
ship

side
,

be
too
late
;
for
the
boat
,
be
already
overladen
,
put
directly
off
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
madam
,
I
be
go
to
relate
to
you
an
instance
of
heroic
affection
in
a
poor
fellow
towards
his
master
,
to
which
love
itself
,
even
among
person
of
superior
education
,
can
produce
but
few
similar
instance
.
<EOS>
My
poor
man
,
be
unable
to
get
me
with
him
into
the
boat
,
leapt
suddenly
into
the
sea
,
and
swam
back
to
the
ship
;
and
,
when
I
gently
rebuke
him
for
his
rashness
<EOS>
,
he
answer
,
he
choose
rather
to
die
with
me
than
to
live
to
carry
the
account
of
my
death
to
my
Amelia
:
at
the
same
time
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
,
he
cry
,
"
Good
Heavens
!
<EOS>
what
will
that
poor
lady
feel
when
she
hear
of
this
!
"
<EOS>
this
tender
concern
for
my
dear
love
endear
the
poor
fellow
more
to
me
than
the
gallant
instance
which
he
have
just
before
give
of
his
affection
towards
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
madam
,
my
eye
be
shock
with
a
sight
,
the
horror
of
which
can
scarce
be
imagine
;
for
the
boat
have
scarce
get
four
hundred
yard
from
the
ship
when
it
be
swallow
up
by
the
merciless
wave
,
which
now
run
so
high
,
that
out
of
the
number
of
person
which
be
in
the
boat
none
recover
the
ship
,
though
many
of
them
we
see
miserably
perish
before
our
eye
,
some
of
them
very
near
us
,
without
any
possibility
of
give
them
the
least
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
whatever
we
feel
for
them
,
we
feel
,
I
believe
,
more
for
ourselves
,
expect
every
minute
when
we
should
share
the
same
fate
.
<EOS>
amongst
the
rest
,
one
of
our
officer
appear
quite
stupifie
with
fear
.
<EOS>
I
never
,
indeed
,
see
a
more
miserable
example
of
the
great
power
of
that
passion
:
I
must
not
,
however
,
omit
do
him
justice
,
by
say
that
I
afterwards
see
the
same
man
behave
well
in
an
engagement
,
in
which
he
be
wound
;
though
there
likewise
he
be
say
to
have
betray
the
same
passion
of
fear
in
his
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
other
of
our
officer
be
no
less
stupified
(
if
I
may
so
express
myself
)
with
fool
-
hardiness
,
and
seem
almost
insensible
of
his
danger
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
have
,
from
this
and
some
other
instance
which
I
have
see
,
be
almost
inclined
to
think
that
the
courage
as
well
as
cowardice
of
fool
proceed
from
not
know
what
be
or
what
be
not
the
proper
object
of
fear
;
indeed
,
we
may
account
for
the
extreme
hardiness
of
some
man
in
the
same
manner
as
for
the
terror
of
child
at
a
bugbear
.
<EOS>
the
child
know
not
but
that
the
bugbear
be
the
proper
object
of
fear
,
the
blockhead
know
not
that
a
cannon
-
ball
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
the
remain
part
of
the
ship
's
crew
and
the
soldiery
,
most
of
them
be
dead
drunk
,
and
the
rest
be
endeavour
,
as
fast
as
they
could
,
to
prepare
for
death
in
the
same
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
this
dreadful
situation
we
be
teach
that
no
human
condition
should
inspire
man
with
absolute
despair
;
for
,
as
the
storm
have
cease
for
some
time
,
the
swelling
of
the
sea
begin
considerably
to
abate
;
and
we
now
perceive
the
man
of
war
which
convoy
us
,
at
no
great
distance
astern
.
<EOS>
those
aboard
her
easily
perceive
our
distress
,
and
make
towards
us
.
<EOS>
when
they
come
pretty
near
they
hoist
out
two
boat
to
our
assistance
.
<EOS>
these
no
sooner
approach
the
ship
than
they
be
instantaneously
fill
,
and
I
myself
get
a
place
in
one
of
them
,
chiefly
by
the
aid
of
my
honest
servant
,
of
whose
fidelity
to
me
on
all
occasion
I
can
not
speak
or
think
too
highly
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
get
into
the
boat
so
much
the
more
easily
,
as
a
great
number
on
board
the
ship
be
render
,
by
drink
,
incapable
of
take
any
care
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
there
be
time
,
however
,
for
the
boat
to
pass
and
repass
;
so
that
,
when
we
come
to
call
over
name
,
three
only
,
of
all
that
remain
in
the
ship
after
the
loss
of
her
own
boat
,
be
miss
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
captain
,
ensign
,
and
myself
,
be
receive
with
many
congratulation
by
our
officer
on
board
the
man
of
war
.
 
<EOS>
the
sea
-
officer
too
,
all
except
the
captain
,
pay
us
their
compliment
,
though
these
be
of
the
rough
kind
,
and
not
without
several
joke
on
our
escape
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
captain
himself
,
we
scarce
see
him
during
many
hour
;
and
,
when
he
appear
,
he
present
a
view
of
majesty
beyond
any
that
I
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
the
dignity
which
he
preserve
do
indeed
give
me
rather
the
idea
of
a
Mogul
,
or
a
turkish
emperor
,
than
of
any
of
the
monarchs
of
Christendom
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
could
resemble
his
walk
on
the
deck
to
nothing
but
the
image
of
Captain
Gulliver
strut
among
the
Lilliputians
;
he
seem
to
think
himself
a
being
of
an
order
superior
to
all
around
him
,
and
more
especially
to
us
of
the
land
service
.
<EOS>
nay
,
such
be
the
behaviour
of
all
the
sea
-
officer
and
sailor
to
us
and
our
soldier
,
that
,
instead
of
appear
to
be
subject
of
the
same
prince
,
engage
in
one
quarrel
,
and
join
to
support
one
cause
,
we
land
-
man
rather
seem
to
be
captive
on
board
an
enemy
's
vessel
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
grievous
misfortune
,
and
often
prove
so
fatal
to
the
service
,
that
it
be
great
pity
<EOS>
some
mean
could
not
be
find
of
cure
it
.

Mr.
Booth
stopt
a
while
to
take
breath

We
will
therefore
give
the

refreshment
to
the
reader

<EOS>
the

"
which
I
happen
to
me
from
this
day
till
my
arrival
at
Gibraltar
be
not
worth
recount
to
you

<EOS>
after
a
voyage
the
remainder
of
which
be
tolerably
prosperous

we
arrive
in
that
garrison

natural
strength

which
be
so
well
known
to
the
whole

<EOS>
"
about
a
week
after
my
arrival
it
be
my
fortune
to
be
order
on
a
sally
party
,
in
which
my
left
leg
be
break
with
a
musket
-
ball
;
and
I
should
most
certainly
have
either
perish
miserably
,
or
must
have
owe
my
preservation
to
some
of
the
enemy
,
<EOS>
have
not
my
faithful
servant
carry
me
off
on
his
shoulder
,
and
afterwards
,
with
the
assistance
of
one
of
his
comrade
,
bring
me
back
into
the
garrison

the
agony
of
my
wound
be
so
great
,
that
it
throw
me
into
a
fever
,
from
whence
my
surgeon
apprehend
much
danger
.
<EOS>
I
now
begin
again
to
feel
for
my
Amelia
,
and
for
myself
on
her
account
;
and
the
disorder
of
my
mind
,
occasion
by
such
melancholy
contemplation
,
very
highly
aggravate
the
distemper
of
my
body
;
insomuch
that
it
would
probably
have
prove
fatal
,
have
it
not
be
for
the
friendship
of
one
Captain
James
,
an
officer
of
our
regiment

and
an
old
acquaintance
,
who
be
undoubtedly
one
of
the
pleasantest
companion

one
of
the
best

natured
man
in

this
worthy
man

who
have
a
head

a
heart
perfectly
adequate
to
every
office

stay
with
me
almost
day

night

my
illness
;
and
by
strengthen
my
hope
,
raise
my
spirit

cheer
my
thought

preserve
me
from
destruction

<EOS>
"
the
behaviour
of
this
man
alone
be
a
sufficient
proof
of
the
truth
of
my
doctrine
,
that
all
man
act
entirely
from
their
passion

for
Bob
James
can
never
be
suppose
to
act
from
any
motive

virtue

religion

since
he
constantly
laugh
at
both

yet
his
conduct
towards
me
alone
demonstrate
a
degree
of
goodness
which
,
perhaps
,
few
of
the
votary
of
either
virtue

religion
can
equal

high
deformity

He
hath
leave
out
of

system
the
good
passion

can
possess

attempt
to
derive
the
effect

energy

that
passion
from
the
base
impulse

pride

fear

<EOS>
whereas
it
be
as
certain
that
love
exist
in
the
mind
of
man
as
that
its
opposite
hatred
doth
;

the

reason
will
equally
prove

existence

one

the
existence

the
apprehension

never

so
intolerable

the
extreme
joy
which
must
arise
in

consider
what

argument

after

Mrs.

Miss

,
be
of
a
different
opinion

advise
poor
Amelia
to
apply
to
an
officer

have
send
over
in

by
whom
the
report

voyage

"
I
have
a
great
curiosity
to
know
the
author
of
this
letter

not
the

trace
of
it
could
be
discover

<EOS>
the
only
person
with
whom
I
live
in
any
great
intimacy
be
Captain
James

and
he
,
madam
,
from
what
I
have
already
tell
you
,
you
will
think
to
be
the
last
person
I
could
suspect

he
declare
upon
his
honour
that
he
know
nothing

matter

no

honour

I

more
sacred

there
be
indeed
an
ensign
of
another
regiment
who
know
my
wife
,
and
who
have
sometimes
visit
me
in
my
illness
;
but
he
be
a
very
unlikely
man
to
interest
himself
much
in
any
affair

do
not
concern
him

he
too
declare

know
nothing

Booth

I
fancy

she

<EOS>
I
could
give
a
shrewd
guess

<EOS>
what
so
likely
as
that
Mrs.

when
you

her

should
have
give
her
foster

send
her
word

whatever
befel
you

yet
stay
 
that
could
not

neither

for
then
she
would
not
have
doubt
whether
she
should
leave
dear
England
on
the
receipt
of
the
letter

<EOS>
no
,
it
must
have
be
by
some
other
mean
;
 
yet
<EOS>
that
I
own
appear
extremely
natural
to
me
;
for
if
I
have
be
leave
by
such
a
husband
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
have
pursue
the
same
method
.
<EOS>

"
no
,
madam
,
"
cry
Booth
<EOS>
,
"
it
must
have
be
convey
by
some
other
channel

for
my
Amelia

I
be
certain
,
be
entirely
ignorant
of
the
manner
;
and
as
for
poor
Atkinson
,
I
be
convinced
he
would
not
have
venture
to
take
such
a
step
without
acquaint
me

<EOS>
besides
,
the
poor
fellow
have
,
I
believe
,
such
a
regard
for
my
wife
,
out
of
gratitude
for
the
favour
she
hath
do
his
mother
,
that
I
make
no

he
be
highly
rejoice
at
her
absence
from
my
melancholy
scene

<EOS>
well
,
whoever
writ
it
be
a
matter
very
immaterial

as
it
seem
so
odd

unaccountable

incident

I
could
not

mention
it

the
time
of

arrival

remarkable

remarkable

full
of
care

it

perhaps
without
a

the

fully
equal

there
be
nothing

so
rare

so
kind

if

such
an
account

particular
which

will

unnatural

I
be
scarce
sooner
recover
from
my
indisposition

Amelia
herself
fall
ill

<EOS>
this
,
I
be
afraid

be
occasion
by
the
fatigue
which
I
could
not
prevent
her
from
undergo
on
my
account

,
as
my
disease
go
off
with
violent
sweat
,
during
which
the
surgeon
strictly
order
that
I
should
lie
by
myself

my
Amelia
could
not
be
prevail
upon
to
spend
many
hour
in

<EOS>
during

restless
fit
she
would
sometimes
read
to
me
several
hour
together

indeed
it
be
not
without
difficulty
that
she
ever
quit
my
bedside

<EOS>
these
fatigue
,
add
to
the
uneasiness
of
her
mind
,
overpower
her
weak
spirit
,
and
throw
her
into
one
of
the
bad
disorder
that
can
possibly
attend
a
woman
;
a
disorder
very
common
among
the
lady
,
and
our
physician
have
not
agree
upon
its
name

<EOS>
some
call
it
fever
on
the
spirit

some
a
nervous
fever

some
the
vapour

hysteric

,
after
this
fatal
act
of
disobedience

she
be
prevail
on
to
receive
you
as
her
child

not
,
however

be
you

to

it

as
the
favourite
which
you

<EOS>
She
forgive
you
;
but
this
be
as
a
Christian
and
a
parent
;
still
preserve
in
her
own
mind
a
just
sense
of
your
disobedience
,
and
a
just
resentment
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
notwithstanding
this
resentment
,
she
desire
you
to
remember
that
,
when
you
a
second
time
venture
to
oppose
her
authority
,
and
nothing
would
serve
you
but
take
a
ramble
(
an
indecent
one
,
I
can
not
help
say
)
<EOS>
after
your
fellow
,
she
think
fit
to
shew
the
excess
of
a
mother
's
tenderness
,
and
furnish
you
with
no
less
than
fifty
pound
for
your
foolish
voyage
.
<EOS>
how
can
she
,
then
,
be
otherwise
than
surprize
at
your
present
demand
?
<EOS>
which
,
should
she
be
so
weak
to
comply
with
,
she
must
expect
to
be
every
month
repeat
,
in
order
to
supply
the
extravagance
of
a
young
rakish
officer

<EOS>
You
say
she
will
compassionate
your
suffering
;
yes
,
surely
she
doth
greatly
compassionate
them
,
and
so
do
I
too
,
though
you
be
neither
<EOS>
so
kind

so
civil
as
to
suppose
I
should

I
forgive
all
your
slight

as
well

<EOS>
nay

I
not

forgive
,

I
pray
daily

<EOS>
but
,
dear

what
could
you
expect
less

what
hath
happen

<EOS>
you
should
have
believe
your

I

not

<EOS>
You
will
not

I

you
have
always

your

above
some

no

Heaven

this

cry
Booth

"
you
will
believe

be
an
excellent
cordial
for

<EOS>
so
dreadful
indeed
be
the

it

that
,

I
find

so

she
come
at

to
herself

I
begin
to
consider
of
every

of
carry
her
immediately
to
Montpelier

which
be
now
become
much
more
necessary
than
before

<EOS>
"
though
I
be
greatly
shock
at
the
barbarity
of
the
letter
,
yet
I
apprehend
no
very
ill
consequence
from
it
;
for
,
as
it
be
believe
all
over
the
army
that
I
have
marry
a
great
fortune
,
I
have
receive
offer
of
money
,
if
I
want
it

from
more
than
one

<EOS>
indeed
,
I
may
have
easily
carry
my
wife
to
Montpelier
at
any
time
;
but
she
be
extremely
averse
to
the
voyage
,
be
desirous
of
our
return
to
England
,
as
I
have
leave
to
do
;
and
she
grow
daily
so
much
well
,
that
,
have
it
not
be
for
the
receipt
of
that
curse
 
<EOS>
which
I
have
just
read
to

I
be
persuade
she
may

<EOS>
"
among
other
there
be
a
colonel
in
the
garrison
who
have
not
only
offer
but
importune
me
to
receive
money
of
him
;
I
now
,
therefore
,
repair
to
him

,
as
a
reason

alter
my

I
produce
the

,
at

,
acquaint
him
with

the
colonel
read
the

shake
his
head
,
and
,
after
some
silence
,
say
he
be
sorry
I
have
refuse
to
accept
his

before

that
he
have
now
so
order

dispose
of

that
he
have
not
a

answer
of
the
same
kind
I
have
from
several
other
,
but
not
one
penny
<EOS>
could
I
borrow
of
any
;
for
I

be
since
firmly
persuade

the
honest
colonel
be
not
content
with
deny
me
himself
,

take
effectual
mean
,
by
spread
the
secret
I
have
so
foolishly
trust
him
with
,
to
prevent
me
from
succeed
elsewhere
;
for
such
be
the
nature
of
man
,
that
whoever
deny
himself
to
do
you
a
favour
be
unwilling
that
it
should
be
do
to
you
by
any
other

<EOS>
"
this
be
the
first
time
I
have
ever
feel
that
distress
which
arise
from
the
want
of
money
;
a
distress
very
dreadful
indeed
in
a
married
state
;
for
what
can
be
more
miserable
than
to
see
anything
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
a
beloved
creature
,
and
not
be
able
to
supply
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
may
wonder
,
madam
,
that
I
have
not
mention
Captain
James
on
this
occasion
;
but
he
be
at
that
time
lay
up
at
Algiers
(
whither
he
have
be
send
by
the
governor
)
in
a
fever
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
return
time
enough
to
supply
me
,
which
he
do
with
the
utmost
readiness
on
the
very
first
mention
of
my
distress
;
and
the
good
colonel
,
notwithstanding
his
have
dispose
of
his
money
,
discount
the
captain
's
draft
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
madam
,
an
instance
in
the
generous
behaviour
of
my
friend
James
,
how
false
be
all
universal
satire
against
humankind
.
<EOS>
He
be
indeed
one
of
the
worthy
man
the
world
ever
produce
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
perhaps
,
you
will
be
more
pleased
still
with
the
extravagant
generosity
of
my
sergeant
.
<EOS>
the
day
before
the
return
of
Mr.
James
,
the
poor
fellow
come
to
me
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
and
beg
I
would
not
be
offend
at
what
he
be
go
to
mention
.
<EOS>
He
then
pull
a
purse
from
his
pocket
,
which
contain
,
he
say
,
the
sum
of
twelve
pound
,
and
which
he
beg
me
to
accept
,
cry
,
he
be
sorry
it
be
not
in
his
power
to
lend
me
whatever
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
strike
with
this
instance
of
generosity
and
friendship
in
such
a
person
,
that
I
give
him
an
opportunity
of
press
me
a
second
time
before
I
make
him
an
answer
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
greatly
surprised
how
he
come
to
be
worth
that
little
sum
,
and
no
less
at
his
be
acquaint
with
my
own
want
.
<EOS>
in
both
which
point
he
presently
satisfy
me
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
first
,
it
seem
he
have
plunder
a
spanish
officer
of
fifteen
pistole
;
and
as
to
the
second
,
he
confess
he
have
it
from
my
wife
's
maid
,
who
have
overhear
some
discourse
between
her
mistress
and
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
people
,
I
believe
,
always
deceive
themselves
,
who
imagine
they
can
conceal
distrest
circumstance
from
their
servant
;
for
these
be
always
extremely
quicksighted
on
such
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
"
cry
Miss
Matthews
,
"
how
astonishing
be
such
behaviour
in
so
low
a
fellow
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
myself
,
"
answer
Booth
;
"
and
yet
I
know
not
,
on
a
more
strict
examination
into
the
matter
,
why
we
should
be
more
surprised
to
see
greatness
of
mind
discover
itself
in
one
degree
or
rank
of
life
than
in
another
.
<EOS>
love
,
benevolence
,
or
what
you
will
please
to
call
it
,
may
be
the
reign
passion
in
a
beggar
as
well
as
in
a
prince
;
and
wherever
it
be
,
its
energy
will
be
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
confess
the
truth
,
I
be
afraid
we
often
compliment
what
we
call
upper
life
,
with
too
much
injustice
,
at
the
expense
of
the
low
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
no
rare
thing
to
see
instance
which
degrade
human
nature
in
person
of
the
high
birth
and
education
,
so
I
apprehend
that
example
of
whatever
be
really
great
and
good
have
be
sometimes
find
amongst
those
who
have
want
all
such
advantage
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
palace
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
do
sometimes
contain
nothing
but
dreariness
and
darkness
,
and
the
sun
of
righteousness
hath
shine
forth
with
all
its
glory
in
a
cottage
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
story
of
Booth
continue
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Booth
thus
go
on
:
  
<EOS>
"
We
now
take
leave
of
the
garrison
,
and
,
have
land
at
Marseilles
,
arrive
at
Montpelier
,
without
anything
happen
to
us
worth
remembrance
,
except
the
extreme
sea
-
sickness
of
poor
Amelia
;
but
I
be
afterwards
well
repay
for
the
terror
which
it
occasion
me
by
the
good
consequence
which
attend
it
;
<EOS>
for
I
believe
it
contribute
,
even
more
than
the
air
of
Montpelier
,
to
the
perfect
re
-
establishment
of
her
health

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
for
interrupt
you
,
"
cry
Miss
Matthews
,
"
<EOS>
but
you
never
satisfy
me
whether
you
take
the
sergeant

money

<EOS>
You
have
make
me
half
in
love
with
that
charming

"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
imagine

answer
Booth

"
I
should
have
take
from
a
poor
fellow
what
be
of
so
little
consequence
to
me
,
and
at
the
same
time
of
so
much
to
him
?
<EOS>
perhaps
,
now
,
you
will
derive
this
from
the
passion
of
pride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
neither
derive
it
from
the
passion

pride
nor
from
the
passion
of
folly

but
methink
you
should
have
accept
the
offer
,
and
I
be
convince
you
hurt
him
very
much
when
you
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
but
pray
proceed
in
your
story
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
Booth
go
on
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
as
Amelia
recover
her
health
and
spirit
daily
,
we
begin
to
pass
our
time
very
pleasantly
at
Montpelier
;
for
the
great
enemy
to
the
French
will
acknowledge
that
they
be
the
good
people
in
the
world
to
live
amongst
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
in
some
country
it
be
almost
as
easy
to
get
a
good
estate
as
a
good
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
in
England
,
particularly
,
acquaintance
be
of
almost
as
slow
growth
as
an
oak
;
so
that
the
age
of
man
scarce
suffice
to
bring
it
to
any
perfection
,
and
family
seldom
contract
any
great
intimacy
till
the
third
,
or
at
least
the
second
generation
.
<EOS>
so
shy
indeed
be
we
English
of
let
a
stranger
into
our
house
,
that
one
would
imagine
we
regard
all
such
as
thief
.
<EOS>
now
the
French
be
the
very
reverse
.
<EOS>
be
a
stranger
among
them
entitle
you
to
the
well
place
,
and
to
the
great
degree
of
civility
;
and
if
you
wear
but
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
,
they
never
suspect
you
be
not
one
.
<EOS>
Their
friendship
indeed
seldom
extend
as
far
as
their
purse
;
nor
be
such
friendship
usual
in
other
country
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
politeness
carry
friendship
far
enough
in
the
ordinary
occasion
of
life
,
and
those
who
want
this
accomplishment
rarely
make
amend
for
it
by
their
sincerity
;
for
bluntness
,
or
rather
rudeness
,
as
it
commonly
deserve
to
be
call
,
be
not
always
so
much
a
mark
of
honesty
as
it
be
take
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
day
after
our
arrival
we
become
acquaint
with
Mons
.
<EOS>
Bagillard
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
Frenchman
of
great
wit
and
vivacity
,
with
a
great
share
of
learning
than
gentleman
be
usually
possess
of
.
<EOS>
as
he
lodge
in
the
same
house
with
us
,
we
be
immediately
acquaint
,
and
I
like
his
conversation
so
well
that
I
never
think
I
have
too
much
of
his
company
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
spend
so
much
of
my
time
with
him
,
that
Amelia
(
I
know
not
whether
I
ought
to
mention
it
)
grow
uneasy
at
our
familiarity
,
and
complain
of
my
be
too
little
with
her
,
from
my
violent
fondness
for
my
new
acquaintance
;
for
,
our
conversation
turn
chiefly
upon
book
,
and
<EOS>
principally
latin
one
(
for
we
read
several
of
the
classic
together
)
,
she
could
have
but
little
entertainment
by
be
with
us
.
<EOS>
when
my
wife
have
once
take
it
into
her
head
that
she
be
deprive
of
my
company
by
M.
Bagillard
,
it
be
impossible
to
change
her
opinion
;
and
,
though
I
now
spend
more
of
my
time
with
her
than
I
have
ever
do
before
,
she
still
grow
more
and
more
dissatisfied
,
till
at
last
she
very
earnestly
desire
me
to
quit
my
lodging
,
and
insist
upon
it
with
more
vehemence
than
I
have
ever
know
her
express
before
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
if
that
excellent
woman
could
ever
be
think
unreasonable
,
I
think
she
be
so
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
in
what
light
soever
her
desire
appear
to
me
,
as
they
manifestly
arise
from
an
affection
of
which
I
have
daily
the
most
endearing
proof
,
I
resolve
to
comply
with
her
,
and
accordingly
remove
to
a
distant
part
of
the
town
;
for
it
be
my
opinion
that
we
can
have
but
<EOS>
little
love
for
the
person
whom
we
will
never
indulge
in
an
unreasonable
demand
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
under
a
difficulty
with
regard
to
Mons
.
<EOS>
bagillard
;
for
,
as
I
could
not
possibly
communicate
to
him
the
true
reason
for
quit
my
lodging
,
so
I
find
it
as
difficult
to
deceive
him
by
a
counterfeit
one
;
besides
,
I
be
apprehensive
<EOS>
I
should
have
little
less
of
his
company
than
before
.
<EOS>
I
could
,
indeed
,
have
avoid
this
dilemma
by
leave
Montpelier
,
for
Amelia
have
perfectly
recover
her
health
;
but
I
have
faithfully
promise
Captain
James
to
wait
his
return
from
Italy
,
whither
he
be
go
some
time
before
from
Gibraltar
;
nor
be
it
proper
for
Amelia
to
take
any
long
journey
,
she
be
now
near
six
month
go
with
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
difficulty
,
however
,
prove
to
be
less
than
I
have
imagine
it
;
for
my
french
friend
,
whether
he
suspect
anything
from
my
wife
's
behaviour
,
though
she
never
,
as
I
observe
,
shew
him
the
least
incivility
,
become
suddenly
as
cold
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
after
our
leave
the
lodging
he
never
make
above
two
or
three
formal
visit
;
indeed
his
time
be
soon
after
entirely
take
up
by
an
intrigue
with
a
certain
countess
,
which
blaze
all
over
Montpelier
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
be
long
in
our
new
apartment
before
an
english
officer
arrive
at
Montpelier
,
and
come
to
lodge
in
the
same
house
with
us
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
whose
name
be
Bath
,
be
of
the
rank
of
a
major
,
and
have
so
much
singularity
in
his
character
,
that
,
perhaps
,
you
never
hear
of
any
like
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
far
from
have
any
of
those
bookish
qualification
which
have
before
cause
my
Amelia
's
disquiet
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
his
discourse
generally
turn
on
matter
of
no
feminine
kind
;
war
and
martial
exploit
be
the
ordinary
topic
of
his
conversation
:
however
,
as
he
have
a
sister
with
whom
Amelia
be
greatly
pleased
,
an
intimacy
presently
grow
between
us
,
and
we
four
live
in
one
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
major
be
a
great
dealer
in
the
marvellous
,
and
be
constantly
the
little
hero
of
his
own
tale
.
<EOS>
this
make
him
very
entertaining
to
Amelia
,
who
,
of
all
the
person
in
the
world
,
hath
the
true
taste
and
enjoyment
of
the
ridiculous
;
for
,
whilst
no
one
sooner
discover
it
in
the
character
of
another
,
no
one
<EOS>
so
well
conceal
her
knowledge
of
it
from
the
ridiculous
person
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
mention
a
sentiment
of
her
on
this
head
,
as
I
think
it
doth
her
great
honour
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
the
same
neglect
,
"
say
she
,
"
for
ridiculous
people
with
the
generality
of
the
world
,
I
should
rather
think
them
the
object
of
tear
than
laughter
;
but
,
in
reality
,
I
have
know
several
who
,
in
some
part
of
their
character
,
have
be
extremely
ridiculous
,
in
other
have
be
altogether
as
amiable
.
<EOS>
for
instance
,
"
say
she
,
"
here
be
the
major
,
who
tell
us
of
many
thing
which
he
have
never
see
,
and
of
other
which
he
hath
never
do
,
and
both
in
the
most
extravagant
excess
;
and
yet
how
amiable
be
his
behaviour
to
his
poor
sister
,
whom
he
hath
not
only
bring
over
hither
for
her
health
,
at
his
own
expence
,
but
be
come
to
bear
her
company
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
madam
,
I
repeat
her
very
word
;
for
I
be
very
apt
to
remember
what
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
easily
believe
,
from
a
circumstance
I
have
just
mention
in
the
major
's
favour
,
especially
when
I
have
tell
you
that
his
sister
be
one
of
the
good
of
girl
,
that
it
be
entirely
necessary
to
hide
from
her
all
kind
of
laughter
at
any
part
of
her
brother
's
behaviour
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
this
be
easy
enough
to
do
;
for
the
poor
girl
be
so
blind
with
love
and
gratitude
,
and
so
highly
honour
and
reverence
her
brother
,
that
she
have
not
the
least
suspicion
that
there
be
a
person
in
the
world
capable
of
laugh
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
be
certain
she
never
make
the
least
discovery
of
our
ridicule
;
for
I
be
well
convinced
she
would
have
resent
it
:
for
,
besides
the
love
she
bear
her
brother
,
she
have
a
little
family
pride
,
which
would
sometimes
appear
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
if
she
have
any
fault
,
it
be
that
of
vanity
,
but
she
be
a
very
good
girl
upon
the
whole
;
and
none
of
us
be
entirely
free
from
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
good
-
natured
fellow
,
Will
,
"
answer
Miss
Matthews
;
"
but
vanity
be
a
fault
of
the
first
magnitude
in
a
woman
,
and
often
the
occasion
of
many
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
Booth
make
no
answer
,
but
continue
his
story
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
this
company
we
pass
two
or
three
month
very
agreeably
,
till
the
major
<EOS>
and
I
both
betook
ourselves
to
our
several
nursery
;
my
wife
be
bring
to
bed
of
a
girl
,
and
Miss
Bath
confine
to
her
chamber
by
a
surfeit
,
which
have
like
to
have
occasion
her
death
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Miss
Matthews
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
,
of
which
when
Booth
ask
the
reason
,
she
say
she
could
not
forbear
at
the
thought
of
two
such
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
really
,
"
say
she
,
"
make
your
wife
's
caudle
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
do
;
and
do
you
think
that
so
extraordinary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
do
,
"
answer
she
;
"
I
think
the
good
husband
have
look
on
their
wife
'
lying
-
in
as
a
time
of
festival
and
jollity
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
do
you
not
even
get
drunk
in
the
time
of
your
wife
's
delivery
?
<EOS>
tell
me
honestly
how
you
employ
yourself
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
honestly
,
"
reply
he
,
"
and
in
defiance
of
your
laughter
,
I
lie
behind
her
bolster
,
and
support
her
in
my
arm
;
and
,
upon
my
soul
,
I
believe
I
feel
more
pain
in
my
mind
than
she
undergo
in
her
body
.
<EOS>
and
now
answer
me
as
honestly
:
do
you
really
think
it
a
proper
time
of
mirth
,
when
the
creature
one
love
to
distraction
be
undergo
the
most
racking
torment
,
as
well
as
in
the
most
imminent
danger
?
<EOS>
and
 
but
I
need
not
express
any
more
tender
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
be
to
answer
honestly
,
"
cry
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
sincerely
,
"
cry
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
honestly
and
sincerely
,
"
say
she
,
"
may
I
never
see
heaven
if
I
do
not
think
you
an
angel
of
a
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
madam
,
"
answer
Booth
 
"
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
you
do
me
too
much
honour
;
there
be
many
such
husband
.
<EOS>
nay
,
have
we
not
an
example
of
the
like
tenderness
in
the
major
?
<EOS>
though
as
to
him
,
I
believe
,
I
shall
make
you
laugh
.
<EOS>
while
my
wife
lie
-
in
,
Miss
Bath
be
extremely
ill
,
I
go
one
day
to
the
door
of
her
apartment
,
to
enquire
after
her
health
,
as
well
as
for
the
major
,
whom
I
have
not
see
during
a
whole
week
.
<EOS>
I
knock
softly
at
the
door
,
and
be
bid
to
open
it
,
I
find
the
major
in
his
sister
's
ante
-
chamber
warm
her
posset
.
<EOS>
His
dress
be
certainly
whimsical
enough
,
have
on
a
woman
's
bedgown
and
a
very
dirty
flannel
nightcap
,
which
,
be
add
to
a
very
odd
person
(
for
he
be
a
very
awkward
thin
man
,
near
seven
foot
high
)
,
may
have
form
,
in
the
opinion
of
most
man
,
a
very
proper
object
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
the
major
start
from
his
seat
at
my
entering
into
the
room
,
and
,
with
much
emotion
,
and
a
great
oath
,
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
be
it
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
then
enquire
after
his
and
his
sister
's
health
.
<EOS>
He
answer
,
that
his
sister
be
well
,
and
he
be
very
well
,
"
though
I
do
not
expect
,
sir
,
"
cry
he
,
with
not
a
little
confusion
,
"
to
be
see
by
you
in
this
situation
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
I
think
it
impossible
he
could
appear
in
a
situation
more
become
his
character
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
?
"
answer
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
g
#
#
#
#
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
for
that
opinion
;
but
,
I
believe
,
sir
,
however
my
weakness
may
prevail
on
me
to
descend
from
it
,
no
man
can
be
more
conscious
of
his
own
dignity
than
myself
.
"
<EOS>
His
sister
then
call
to
him
from
the
inner
room
;
upon
which
he
ring
the
bell
for
her
servant
,
and
then
,
after
a
stride
or
two
across
the
room
,
he
say
,
with
an
elated
aspect
,
"
I
would
not
have
you
think
,
Mr.
Booth
,
because
you
have
catch
me
in
this
deshabille
,
by
come
upon
me
a
little
too
abruptly
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
say
a
little
too
abruptly
 
that
I
be
my
sister
's
nurse
.
<EOS>
I
know
better
what
be
due
to
the
dignity
of
a
man
,
and
I
have
shew
it
in
a
line
of
battle
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
make
a
figure
there
,
Mr.
Booth
,
and
become
my
character
;
by
g
#
#
#
#
I
ought
not
to
be
despise
too
much
if
my
nature
be
not
totally
without
its
weakness
.
"
<EOS>
He
utter
this
,
and
some
more
of
the
same
kind
,
with
great
majesty
,
or
,
as
he
call
it
,
dignity
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
use
some
hard
word
that
I
do
not
understand
;
for
all
his
word
be
not
to
be
find
in
a
dictionary
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
I
could
not
easily
refrain
from
laughter
;
however
,
I
conquer
myself
,
and
soon
after
retire
from
him
,
astonish
that
it
be
possible
for
a
man
to
possess
true
goodness
,
and
be
at
the
same
time
ashamed
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
if
I
be
surprize
at
what
have
past
at
this
visit
,
how
much
more
be
I
surprize
the
next
morning
,
when
he
come
very
early
to
my
chamber
,
and
tell
me
he
have
not
be
able
to
sleep
one
wink
at
what
have
past
between
us
!
"
<EOS>
there
be
some
word
of
yours
,
"
say
he
,
"
which
must
be
further
explain
before
we
part
.
<EOS>
You
tell
me
,
sir
,
when
you
find
me
in
that
situation
,
which
I
can
not
bear
to
recollect
,
that
you
think
I
could
not
appear
in
one
more
become
my
character
;
these
be
the
word
 
I
shall
never
forget
them
.
<EOS>
do
you
imagine
that
there
be
any
of
the
dignity
of
a
man
want
in
my
character
?
<EOS>
do
you
think
that
I
have
,
during
my
sister
's
illness
,
behave
with
a
weakness
that
savour
too
much
of
effeminacy
?
<EOS>
I
know
how
much
it
be
beneath
a
man
to
whine
and
whimper
about
a
trifling
girl
as
well
as
you
or
any
man
;
and
,
if
my
sister
have
die
,
I
should
have
behave
like
a
man
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
think
I
confine
myself
from
company
merely
upon
her
account
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
disorder
myself
.
<EOS>
and
when
you
surprize
me
in
that
situation
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
again
,
in
that
situation
  
h
er
nurse
have
not
leave
the
room
three
minute
,
and
I
be
blow
the
fire
for
fear
it
should
have
go
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
this
manner
he
run
on
almost
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
he
would
suffer
me
to
speak
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
look
steadfastly
in
his
face
,
I
ask
him
if
I
must
conclude
that
he
be
in
earnest
?
"
<EOS>
in
earnest
!
"
say
he
,
repeat
my
word
,
"
do
you
then
take
my
character
for
a
jest
?
"
 
<EOS>
Lookee
,
sir
,
say
I
,
very
gravely
,
I
think
we
know
one
another
very
well
;
and
I
have
no
reason
to
suspect
you
should
impute
it
to
fear
when
I
tell
you
I
be
so
far
from
intend
to
affront
you
,
<EOS>
that
I
mean
you
one
of
the
high
compliment
.
<EOS>
tenderness
for
woman
be
so
far
from
lessen
,
that
it
prove
a
true
manly
character
.
<EOS>
the
manly
Brutus
shew
the
utmost
tenderness
to
his
Portia
;
and
the
great
king
of
Sweden
,
the
brave
,
and
even
fierce
of
man
,
shut
himself
up
three
whole
day
in
the
midst
of
a
campaign
,
and
would
see
no
company
,
on
the
death
of
a
favourite
sister
.
<EOS>
at
these
word
I
see
his
feature
soften
;
and
he
cry
out
,
"
D####n
me
,
<EOS>
I
admire
the
king
of
Sweden
of
all
the
man
in
the
world
;
and
he
be
a
rascal
that
be
ashamed
of
do
anything
which
the
king
of
Sweden
do
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
if
any
king
of
Sweden
in
France
be
to
tell
me
that
his
sister
have
more
merit
than
mine

knock
his

my

at

disappoint

her
former
uneasiness

her
impatience
for
the
arrival
of
Captain
James

that

one
day
,
as
we
be
sit
together

I
hear
a
violent
scream
;
upon

my

start
up

cry
out

sure
that

Miss

immediately
run
towards
the
chamber

it
proceed

<EOS>
I
follow
her
;

when
we
arrive
,
we
there
beheld
the
most
shocking
sight
imaginable
;
<EOS>
Miss
Bath
lie
dead
on
the
floor
,

the
major
all
bloody
kneel
by
her

roar
out
for
assistance

Amelia

though
she
be
herself
in
little

run
hastily
to
her

bare
her

loosen

stay

I
run
up
and
down

scarce
knowing
what
I
do
,
call
for
water
and
cordial
,
and
despatch
several
servant
one
after
another
for
doctor
and
surgeon

water
,
cordial
,
and
all
necessary
implement
be
bring
,
Miss
Bath
be
at
length
recover
,
and
place
in
her
chair
,
when
the
major
seat
himself
by
her
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
the
young
lady
be
restore
to
life
,
the
major
,
who
,
till
then
,
have
engage
as
little
of
his
own
as
of
any
other
person
's
attention
,
become
the
object
of
all
our
consideration
,
especially
his
poor
sister
's
,
who
have
no
sooner
recover
sufficient
strength
than
she
begin
to
lament
her
brother
,
cry
out
that
he
be
kill
;
and
bitterly
bewail
her
fate
,
in
have
revive
from
her
swoon
to
behold
so
dreadful
a
spectacle
.
<EOS>
while
Amelia
apply
herself
to
soothe
the
agony
of
her
friend
,
I
begin
to
enquire
into
the
condition
of
the
major
,
in
which
I
be
assist
by
a
surgeon
,
who
now
arrive
.
<EOS>
the
major
declare
,
with
great
chearfulness
,
that
he
do
not
apprehend
his
wound
to
be
in
the
least
dangerous
,
and
therefore
beg
his
sister
to
be
comfort
,
say
he
be
convince
the
surgeon
would
soon
give
her
the
same
assurance
;
but
that
good
man
be
not
so
liberal
of
assurance
as
the
major
have
expect
;
for
as
soon
as
he
have
probe
the
wound
he
afford
no
more
than
hope
,
declare
that
it
be
a
very
ugly
wound
;
but
add
,
by
way
of
consolation
,
that
he
have
cure
many
much
bad
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
the
major
be
dr
his
sister
seem
to
possess
his
whole
thought
,
and
all
his
care
be
to
relieve
her
grief
.
<EOS>
He
solemnly
protest
that
it
be
no
more
than
a
flesh
wound
,
and
not
very
deep
,
nor
could
,
as
he
apprehend
,
be
in
the
least
dangerous
;
and
as
for
the
cold
expression
of
the
surgeon
,
he
very
well
account
for
them
from
a
motive
too
obvious
to
be
mention
.
<EOS>
from
these
declaration
of
her
brother
,
and
the
interposition
of
her
friend
,
and
,
above
all
,
I
believe
,
from
that
vast
vent
which
she
have
give
to
her
fright
,
Miss
Bath
seem
a
little
pacified
:
Amelia
,
therefore
,
at
last
prevail
;
and
,
as
terror
abate
,
curiosity
become
the
superior
passion
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
now
begin
to
enquire
what
have
occasion
that
accident
whence
all
the
uproar
arise
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
major
take
me
by
the
hand

look
very
kindly
at
me

say
,
"
My
dear
Mr.
Booth

I
must
begin
by
ask
your
pardon

I
have
do
you
an
injury

which
nothing

the
height
of
friendship

excuse

therefore
nothing

the
height

<EOS>
this
preamble
,
madam
,
you
will
easily
believe
,
greatly
alarm
all
the
company
,
but
especially
me
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
dear
major
,
I
forgive
you
,
let
it
be
what
it
will
;
but
what
be
it
possible
you
can
have
do
to
injure
me
?
"
<EOS>
that
,

reply
he
,

I
be

a

conclude
to

of
the
high
injury

<EOS>
I
have
take
out
of
your

do
yourself
justice

<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
have
kill
the
man
who
hath
<EOS>

your
honour

<EOS>
I
mean
that
villain
Bagillard
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
proceed
;
for
you
,
madam
,
"
say
he
to
my
wife
,
"
be
concerned
,
and
I
know
what
be
due
to
the
dignity
of
your
sex
.
<EOS>
"
Amelia
,
I
observe
,
turn
pale
at
these
word
,
but
eagerly
beg
him
to
proceed
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
madam
,
"
answer
he
,
"
if
I
be
command
by
a
lady
,
it
be
a
part
of
my
dignity
to
obey
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
tell
us
that
Bagillard
have
rally
him
upon
a
supposition
that
he
be
pursue
my
wife
with
a
view
of
gallantry
;
tell
him
that
he
could
never
succeed
;
give
hint
that
,
if
it
have
be
possible
,
he
should
have
succeed
himself
;
and
end
with
call
my
poor
Amelia
an
accomplished
prude
;
upon
which
the
major
give
Bagillard
a
box
in
the
ear
,
and
both
immediately
draw
their
sword
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
major
have
scarce
end
his
speech
when
a
servant
come
into
the
room
,
and
tell
me
there
be
a
fryar
below
who
desire
to
speak
with
me
in
great
haste
.
<EOS>
I
shake
the
major
by
the
hand
,
and
tell
him
I
not
only
forgave
him
,
but
be
extremely
oblige
to
his
friendship
;
and
then
,
go
to
the
fryar
,
I
find
that
he
be
Bagillard
's
confessor
,
from
whom
he
come
to
me
,
with
an
earnest
desire
of
see
me
,
that
he
may
ask
my
pardon
and
receive
my
forgiveness
before
he
die
for
the
injury
he
have
intend
me

<EOS>
My
wife
at
first
oppose
my
going
,
from
some
sudden
fear
on
my
account

but
when
she
be
convince
they
be
groundless
she
consent

<EOS>
"
I
find
Bagillard
in
his
bed
;
for
the
major
's
sword
have
pass
up
to
the
very
hilt
through
his
body
.
<EOS>
after
have
very
earnestly
ask
my
pardon
,
he
make
me
many
compliment
on
the
possession
of
a
woman
who
,
join
to
the
most
exquisite
beauty
,
be
mistress
of
the
most
impregnable
virtue
;
<EOS>
as
a
proof
of
which
he
acknowledge
the
vehemence
as
well
as
ill
success
of
his
attempt
:
and
,
to
make
Amelia
's
virtue
appear
the
bright
,
his
vanity
be
so
predominant
he
could
not
forbear
run
over
the
name
of
several
woman
of
fashion
who
have
yield
to
his
passion
,
which
,
he
say
,
have
never
rage
so
violently
for
any
other
as
for
my
poor
Amelia
;
and
that
this
violence
,
which
he
have
find
wholly
unconquerable
,
he
hope
would
procure
his
pardon
at
my
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
unnecessary
to
mention
what
I
say
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
assure
him
of
my
entire
forgiveness
;
and
so
we
part
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
afterwards
think
myself
almost
oblige
to
him
for
a
meeting
with
Amelia
the
most
luxuriously
delicate
that
can
be
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
run
to
my
wife
,
whom
I
embrace
with
rapture
of
love
and
tenderness

<EOS>
when
the
first
torrent
of
these
be
a
little
abated

your

you
from

me

little
unreasonable

much
uneasiness

well

I

I
will
not
tire
you
with
the
repetition
of
the
whole
argument

in
which
the
major
do
not
prevail

I
really
believe
I
sink
a
little
in
his
esteem
upon
that
account

till
Captain
James
,
who
arrive
soon
after

again
perfectly
reinstate
me

favour

when
the
captain
be
come
there
remain
no
cause
of
our
long
stay
at
Montpelier

for
,
as
to
my
wife
,
she
be
in
a
well
state
of
health
than
I
have
ever
know
her
;
and
Miss
Bath
have
not
only
recover
her
health

her
bloom
,
and
from
a
pale
skeleton
be
become
a
plump
,
handsome
young
woman

<EOS>
James
be
again
my
cashier
;
for
,
far
from
receive
any
remittance
,
it
be
now
a
long
time
since
I
have
receive
any
letter
from
England
,
though
both
myself
and
my
dear
Amelia
have
write
several
,
both
to
my
mother
and
sister
;
and
now
,
at
our
departure
from
Montpelier
,
I
bethink
myself
of
write
to
my
good
friend
the
doctor
,
acquaint
him
with
our
journey
to
Paris
,
whither
I
desire
he
would
direct
his
answer

<EOS>
"
at
Paris
we
all
arrive
without
encounter
any
adventure
on
the
road
worth
relate
;
nor
do
anything
of
consequence
happen
here
during
the
first
fortnight
;
for
,
as
you
know
neither
Captain
James
nor
Miss
Bath
,
it
be
scarce
worth
tell
you
that
an
affection
,
which
afterwards
end
in
a
marriage
,
begin
now
to
appear
between
them
,
in
which
it
may
appear
odd
to
you
that
I
make
the
first
discovery
of
the
lady
's
flame
,
and
my
wife
of
the
captain
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
seventeenth
day
after
our
arrival
at
Paris
I
receive
a
letter
from
the
doctor
,
which
I
have
in
my
pocket
-
book
;
and
,
if
you
please
,
I
will
read
it
you
;
for
I
would
not
willingly
do
any
injury
to
his
word
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
lady
,
you
may
easily
believe
,
desire
to
hear
the
letter
,
and
Booth
read
it
as
follow
:
  
"
<EOS>
my
dear
child
 
<EOS>
for
I
will
now
call
you
so
,
as
you
have
neither
of
you
now
any
other
parent
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
of
this
melancholy
news
I
should
have
send
you
early
notice
if
I
have
think
you
ignorant
of
it
,
or
indeed
if
I
have
know
whither
to
have
write
.
<EOS>
if
your
sister
hath
receive
any
letter
from
you
<EOS>
she
hath
keep
them
a
secret
,
and
perhaps
out
of
affection
to
you
hath
reposit
them
in
the
same
place
where
she
keep
her
goodness
,
and
,
what
I
be
afraid
be
much
dearer
to
her
,
her
money
.
<EOS>
the
report
concern
you
have
be
various
;
so
be
always
the
case
in
matter
where
man
be
ignorant
;
for
,
when
no
man
know
what
the
truth
be
,
every
man
think
himself
at
liberty
to
report
what
he
please
.
<EOS>
those
who
wish
you
well
,
son
Booth
,
say
simply
that
you
be
dead
:
other
,
that
you
run
away
from
the
siege
,
and
be
cashier
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
daughter
,
all
agree
that
she
be
a
saint
above
;
and
there
be
not
want
those
who
hint
that
her
husband
send
her
thither
.
<EOS>
from
this
beginning
you
will
expect
,
I
suppose
,
well
news
than
I
be
go
to
tell
you
;
but
pray
,
my
dear
child
,
why
may
not
I
,
who
have
always
laugh
at
my
own
affliction
,
laugh
at
yours
,
without
the
censure
of
much
malevolence
?
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
learn
this
temper
from
me
;
for
,
take
my
word
for
it
,
nothing
truer
ever
come
from
the
mouth
of
a
heathen
than
that
sentence
:
  
"

<EOS>
and
though
I
must
confess
I
never
think
Aristotle
(
whom
I
do
not
take
for
so
great
a
blockhead
as
some
who
have
never
read
him
)
doth
not
very
well
resolve
the
doubt
which
he
hath
raise
in
his
Ethics
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
how
a
man
in
the
midst
of
King
Priam
's
misfortune
can
be
call
happy
?
<EOS>
yet
I
have
long
think
that
there
be
no
calamity
so
great
that
a
christian
philosopher
may
not
reasonably
laugh
at
it
;
if
the
heathen
Cicero
,
doubt
of
immortality
(
for
so
wise
a
man
must
have
doubt
of
that
which
have
such
slend
argument
to
support
it
)
,
could
assert
it
as
the
office
of
wisdom

<EOS>
"
which
passage
,
with
much
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
you
will
find
in
the
third
book
of
his
Tusculan
Questions
.
  
<EOS>
"
with
how
much
great
confidence
may
a
good
christian
despise
,
and
even
deride
,
all
temporary
and
short
transitory
evil
!
<EOS>
if
the
poor
wretch
,
who
be
trudge
on
to
his
miserable
cottage
,
can
laugh
at
the
storm
and
tempest
,
the
rain
and
whirlwind
,
which
surround
him
,
while
his
rich
hope
be
only
that
of
rest
;
how
much
more
chearfully
must
a
man
pass
through
such
transient
evil
,
whose
spirit
be
buoy
up
with
the
certain
expectation
of
find
a
noble
palace
and
the
most
sumptuous
entertainment
ready
to
receive
him
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
much
like
the
simile
;
but
I
can
not
think
of
a
well
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
inadequate
as
the
simile
be
,
we
may
,
I
think
,
from
the
action
of
mankind
,
conclude
that
they
will
consider
it
as
much
too
strong
;
for
,
in
the
case
I
have
put
of
the
entertainment
,
be
there
any
man
so
tender
or
poor
-
spirit
as
not
to
despise
,
and
often
to
deride
,
the
fierce
of
these
inclemency
which
I
have
mention
?
<EOS>
but
in
our
journey
to
the
glorious
mansion
of
everlasting
bliss
,
how
severely
be
every
little
rub
,
every
trifling
accident
,
lament
!
<EOS>
and
if
Fortune
shower
down
any
of
her
heavy
storm
upon
us
,
how
wretched
do
we
presently
appear
to
ourselves
and
to
other
!
<EOS>
the
reason
of
this
can
be
no
other
than
that
we
be
not
in
earnest
in
our
faith
;
at
the
good
,
we
think
with
too
little
attention
on
this
our
great
concern
.
<EOS>
while
the
most
paultry
matter
of
this
world
,
even
those
pitiful
trifle
,
those
childish
gewgaw
,
rich
and
honour

with
the
utmost
earnestness

most
serious
application

the
grand
and
weighty
affair
of
immortality
be
postpone
and
disregard
,
nor
ever
bring
into
the
least
competition
with
our
affair
here

<EOS>
if
one
of

cloth
should
begin
a
discourse
of
heaven
in
the
scene
of
business

pleasure
;
in
the
court

at
Garraway

would
he
gain
a
hearing

unless
,
perhaps
,
of
some
sorry
jester
who
would
desire
to
ridicule
him
?
<EOS>
would
he
not
presently
acquire
the
name
of
the
mad
parson
,

be

by
all
man
worthy
of
Bedlam

in

I
mention

asleep

both

endeavour
as
much
as
he
can

I
will
now
communicate
to
you

in

the
news

which
I
threaten

<EOS>
Your

you

hath
leave
her
whole
fortune

her
elder
daughter

all
the
ill
news

have
to
tell

<EOS>
confess
now
,
if
you
be
awake

do
you
not
expect
it
be
much
bad
;
do
not
you
apprehend
that
your
charming
child
be
dead

<EOS>
far
from
it

in
perfect
health

the
admiration

everybody

what
be
more

he
will
be
take
care
of
,
with
the
tenderness
of
a
parent

till
your
return

<EOS>
what
pleasure
must
this
give
you
!
<EOS>
if
indeed
anything
can
add
to
the
happiness
of
a
married
couple
who
be
extremely
and
deservedly
fond
of
each
other
,
and
,
as
you
write
me
,
in
perfect
health
.
<EOS>
a
superstitious
heathen
would
have
dread
the
malice
of
Nemesis
in
your
situation
;
but
as
I
be
a
Christian

I
shall
venture
to
add
another
circumstance
to
your
felicity

by
assure
you
that
you

your

a
faithful

do
not

therefore

my

fall
into
that
fault
which
the
excellent
thucydides
observe

bear
heavily

sure
,
madam

there
be
something
in
the

admire
beyond

what
think

easy

generous

friendly
manner

him
the
most
agreeable
companion

now
in
the
high
spirit

which
he
be
pleased

<EOS>
We
sit
together
to
a
very
late
hour
;
for
so
excellent
be
my
wife
's
constitution
,
that
she
declare
she
be
scarce
sensible
of
any
fatigue
from
her
late
journey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Amelia
sleep
not
a
wink
all
night
,
and
in
the
morning
early
the
doctor
accompany
us
to
the
little
infant
.
<EOS>
the
transport
we
feel
on
this
occasion
be
really
enchanting
,
nor
can
any
but
a
fond
parent
conceive
,
I
be
certain
,
the
least
idea
of
them
.
<EOS>
Our
imagination
suggest
a
hundred
agreeable
circumstance
,
none
of
which
have
,
perhaps
,
any
foundation
.
<EOS>
We
make
word
and
mean
out
of
every
sound
,
and
in
every
feature
find
out
some
resemblance
to
my
Amelia
,
as
she
do
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
ask
your
pardon
for
dwell
on
such
incident
,
and
will
proceed
to
scene
which
,
to
most
person
,
will
be
more
entertaining
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
go
hence
to
pay
a
visit
to
Miss
Harris
,
whose
reception
of
us
be
,
I
think
,
truly
ridiculous
;
and
,
as
you
know
the
lady
,
I
will
endeavour
to
describe
it
particularly
.
<EOS>
at
our
first
arrival
we
be
usher
into
a
parlour
,
where
we
be
suffer
to
wait
almost
an
hour
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
lady
of
the
house
appear
in
deep
mourning
,
with
a
face
,
if
possible
,
more
dismal
than
her
dress
,
in
which
,
however
,
there
be
every
appearance
of
art
.
<EOS>
Her
feature
be
indeed
skrewe
up
to
the
very
height
of
grief
.
<EOS>
with
this
face
,
and
in
the
most
solemn
gait
,
she
approach
Amelia
,
and
coldly
salute
her
.
<EOS>
after
which
she
make
me
a
very
distant
formal
courtesy
,
and
we
all
sit
down
.
<EOS>
a
short
silence
now
ensue
,
which
Miss
Harris
at
length
break
with
a
deep
sigh
,
and
say
,
"
Sister
,
here
be
a
great
alteration
in
this
place
since
you
see
it
last
;
Heaven
hath
be
pleased
to
take
my
poor
mother
to
itself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
here
she
wipe
her
eye
,
and
then
continue
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
know
my
duty
,
and
have
learn
a
proper
resignation
to
the
divine
will
;
but
something
be
to
be
allow
to
grief
for
the
good
of
mother
;
for
so
she
be
to
us
both
;
and
if
at
last
she
make
any
distinction
,
she
must
have
have
her
reason
for
so
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
can
truly
say
I
never
wish
,
much
less
desire
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
tear
now
stand
in
poor
Amelia
's
eye
;
indeed
,
she
have
pay
too
many
already
for
the
memory
of
so
unnatural
a
parent
.
<EOS>
She
answer
,
with
the
sweetness
of
an
angel
,
that
she
be
far
from
blame
her
sister
's
emotion
on
so
tender
an
occasion
;
that
she
heartily
join
with
her
in
her
grief
;
for
that
nothing
which
her
mother
have
do
in
the
latter
part
of
her
life
could
efface
the
remembrance
of
that
tenderness
which
she
have
formerly
shew
her
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
catch
hold
of
the
word
efface
,
and
ring
the
change
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Efface
!
"
<EOS>
cry
she
,
"
o
Miss
Emily
<EOS>
(
for
you
must
not
expect
me
to
repeat
name
that
will
be
for
ever
odious
)
,
I
wish
indeed
everything
could
be
efface
.
 
<EOS>
Effaced
!
<EOS>
o
that
that
be
possible
!
<EOS>
we
may
then
have
still
enjoy
my
poor
mother
;
for
I
be
convinced
she
never
recover
her
grief
on
a
certain
occasion
.
"
 
<EOS>
thus
she
run
on
,
and
,
after
many
bitter
stroke
upon
her
sister
,
at
last
directly
charge
her
mother
's
death
on
my
marriage
with
Amelia
.
<EOS>
I
could
be
silent
then
no
longer
.
<EOS>
I
remind
her
of
the
perfect
reconciliation
between
us
before
my
departure
,
and
the
great
fondness
which
she
express
for
me
;
nor
could
I
help
say
,
in
very
plain
term
,
that
if
she
have
ever
change
her
opinion
of
me
,
as
I
be
not
conscious
of
have
deserve
such
a
change
by
my
own
behaviour
,
I
be
well
convinced
to
whose
good
office
I
owe
it
.
<EOS>
guilt
hath
very
quick
ear
to
an
accusation
.
<EOS>
Miss
Harris
immediately
answer
to
the
charge
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
such
suspicion
be
no
more
than
she
expect
;
that
they
be
of
a
piece
with
every
other
part
of
my
conduct
,
and
give
her
one
consolation
,
that
they
serve
to
account
for
her
sister
Emily
's
unkindness
,
as
well
to
herself
as
to
her
poor
deceased
mother
,
and
in
some
measure
lessen
the
guilt
of
it
with
regard
to
her
,
since
it
be
not
easy
to
know
how
far
a
woman
be
in
the
power
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Amelia
redden
at
this
reflection
on
me
,
and
beg
her
sister
to
name
any
single
instance
of
unkindness
or
disrespect
in
which
she
have
ever
offend
.
<EOS>
to
this
the
other
answer
(
I
be
sure
I
repeat
her
word
,
though
I
can
not
mimic
either
the
voice
or
air
with
which
they
be
speak
)
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Miss
Emily
,
which
be
to
be
the
judge
,
yourself
or
that
gentleman
?
<EOS>
I
remember
the
time
when
I
could
have
trust
to
your
judgment
in
any
affair
;
but
you
be
now
no
longer
mistress
of
yourself
,
and
be
not
answerable
for
your
action
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
my
constant
prayer
that
your
action
may
not
be
impute
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
constant
prayer
of
that
bless
woman
,
my
dear
mother
,
who
be
now
a
saint
above
;
a
saint
whose
name
I
can
never
mention
without
a
tear
,
though
I
find
you
can
hear
it
without
one
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
observe
some
concern
on
so
melancholy
an
occasion
;
it
seem
due
to
decency
;
but
,
perhaps
(
for
I
always
wish
to
excuse
you
)
<EOS>
you
be
forbid
to
cry
.
<EOS>
"
the
idea
of
be
bid
or
forbid
to
cry
strike
so
strongly
on
my
fancy
,
that
indignation
only
could
have
prevent
me
from
laugh
.
<EOS>
but
my
narrative
,
I
be
afraid
,
begin
to
grow
tedious
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
after
hearing
,
for
near
an
hour
,
every
malicious
insinuation
which
a
fertile
genius
could
invent
,
we
take
our
leave
,
and
separate
as
person
who
would
never
willingly
meet
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
next
morning
after
this
interview
Amelia
receive
a
long
letter
from
Miss
Harris
;
in
which
,
after
many
bitter
invective
against
me
,
she
excuse
her
mother
,
alledge
that
she
have
be
drive
to
do
as
she
do
in
order
to
prevent
Amelia
's
ruin
,
if
her
fortune
have
fall
into
my
hand
.
<EOS>
She
likewise
very
remotely
hint
that
she
would
be
only
a
trustee
for
her
sister
's
child
,
and
tell
her
that
on
one
condition
only
she
would
consent
to
live
with
her
as
a
sister
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
if
she
could
by
any
mean
be
separate
from
that
man
,
as
she
be
pleased
to
call
me
,
who
have
cause
so
much
mischief
in
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
enraged
at
this
usage
,
that
,
have
not
Amelia
intervene
,
I
believe
I
should
have
apply
to
a
magistrate
for
a
search
-
warrant
for
that
picture
,
which
there
be
so
much
reason
to
suspect
she
have
steal
;
and
which
I
be
convince
,
upon
a
search
,
we
should
have
find
in
her
possession
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
it
be
possible
enough
,
"
cry
Miss
Matthews
;
"
for
I
believe
there
be
no
wickedness
of
which
the
lady
be
not
capable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
agreeable
letter
be
succeed
by
another
of
the
like
comfortable
kind
,
which
inform
me
that
the
company
in
which
I
be
,
be
an
additional
one
raise
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
,
be
reduce
;
so
that
I
be
now
a
lieutenant
on
half
-
pay

<EOS>
"
whilst
we
be
meditate
on
our
present
situation
the
good
doctor
come
to
us
.
<EOS>
when
we
relate
to
him
the
manner
in
which
my
sister
have
treat
us
,
he
cry
out
,
"
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
I
pity
her
heartily
;
"
for
this
be
the
severe
resentment
he
ever
express
;
indeed
,
I
have
often
hear
him
say
that
a
wicked
soul
be
the
great
object
of
compassion
in
the
world
.
"
 
<EOS>
a
sentiment
which
we
shall
leave
the
reader
a
little
time
to
digest
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Mr.
Booth
conclude
his
story
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
next
day
the
doctor
set
out
for
his
parsonage
,
which
be
about
thirty
mile
distant
,
whither
Amelia
and
myself
accompany
him
,
and
where
we
stay
with
him
all
the
time
of
his
residence
there
,
be
almost
three
month
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
situation
of
the
parish
under
my
good
friend
's
care
be
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
It
be
place
among
meadow
,
wash
by
a
clear
trout
-
stream
,
and
flank
on
both
side
with
down
.
<EOS>
His
house
,
indeed
,
would
not
much
attract
the
admiration
of
the
virtuoso
.
<EOS>
He
build
it
himself
,
and
it
be
remarkable
only
for
its
plainness
;
with
which
the
furniture
so
well
agree
,
that
there
be
no
one
thing
in
it
that
may
not
be
absolutely
necessary
,
except
book
,
and
the
print
of
Mr.
Hogarth
,
whom
he
call
a
moral
satirist
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
however
,
can
be
imagine
more
agreeable
than
the
life
that
the
doctor
lead
in
this
homely
house
,
which
he
call
his
earthly
paradise
.
<EOS>
all
his
parishioner
,
whom
he
treat
as
his
child

him
as
their
common
father

once
in
a
week
he
constantly
visit
every
house
in
the
parish

examine
,
commend
,
and
rebuke
,
as
he
find
occasion
.
<EOS>
this
be
practise
likewise
by
his
curate
in
his
absence
;
and
so
good
an
effect
be
produce
by
this
their
care
,
that
no
quarrel
ever

either
to
blow

oath

but
to
return
from
so
agreeable
a
digression
,
to
my
own
affair
,
that
be
much
less
worth
your
attention

<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
the
pleasure
I
taste
in
this
sweet
place

in
the
most
delightful
company

the
woman

man
whom
I
love
above
all

melancholy
reflexion
concern
my
unhappy
circumstance

often
steal
into
my
thought

My
fortune
be
now
reduce
to
less
than
forty
pound
a

year

I
have
already
two
child

my

Amelia
be
again
with
child

<EOS>
"
one
day
the
doctor
find
me
sit
by
myself
,
and
employ
in
melancholy
contemplation
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
have
observe
me
grow
of
late
very
serious
;
that
he
know
the
occasion
,
and
neither
wonder
at
nor
blame
me
.
<EOS>
He
then
ask
me
if
I
have
any
prospect
of
go
again
into
the
army
;
if
not
,
what
scheme
of
life
I
propose
to
myself
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
that
,
as
I
have
no
powerful
friend
,
I
could
have
but
little
expectation
in
a
military
way
;
that
I
be
as
incapable
of
thinking
of
any
other
scheme
,
as
all
business
require
some
knowledge
or
experience
,
and
likewise
money
to
set
up
with
;
of
all
which
I
be
destitute
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
You
must
know
then
,
child
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
that
I
have
be
think
on
this
subject
as
well
as
you
;
for
I
can
think
,
I
promise
you
,
with
a
pleasant
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
these
be
his
word
.
"
<EOS>
as
to
the
army
,
perhaps
mean
may
be
find
of
get
you
another
commission
;
but
my
daughter
seem
to
have
a
violent
objection
to
it
;
and
to
be
plain
,
I
fancy
you
<EOS>
yourself
will
find
no
glory
make
you
amend
for
your
absence
from
her
.
<EOS>
and
for
my
part
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
never
think
those
man
wise
who
,
for
any
worldly
interest
,
forego
the
great
happiness
of
their
life

<EOS>
if
I
mistake
not

say
he

a
country
life

you
could
be
always
together

would
make
you
both
much
happy
people

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
answer
,
that
of
all
thing
I
prefer
it
most
;
and
I
believe
Amelia
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
doctor
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
propose
to
me
to
turn
farmer
,
and
offer
to
let
me
his
parsonage
,
which
be
then
become
vacant
.
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
a
farm
which
require
but
little
stock
,
and
that
little
should
not
be
want
.
  
<EOS>

I
embrace
this
offer
very
eagerly
,
and
with
great
thankfulness
,
and
immediately
repair
to
Amelia
to
communicate
it
to
her
,
and
to
know
her
sentiment

Amelia
receive
the
news

the
high
transport
of
joy

she
say
that
her
great
fear

always

She
be
so
kind

to
say
that
all

equal

I

it
must
appear
dull
in
description

for
who
can
describe
the
pleasure
which
the
morning
air
give
to
one
in
perfect
health
;
the
flow
of
spirit
which
spring
up
from
exercise
;
the
delight
which
parent
feel
from
the
prattle

innocent
folly

the
joy
with
which
the
tender

inspire
a

the
chearful

solid
comfort

<EOS>
all
these
pleasure

every
other
of
which
our

be
capable

we
taste
in
the
high
degree

Our
happiness
be
,
perhaps
,
too
great
;
for
fortune
seem
to
grow
envious
of
it

interpose
one
of
the
most
cruel
accident

You

the

have

his

the

indeed

it
be
impossible
to
be
once

hearing

I
be
sure
you
will
neither
wonder
that

be
choose

attend
the

that
the

disagreeable
it

to
his
inclination

by
this
mean
I
be
bereft
not
only
of
the
good
companion
in
the
world

of
the
good
counsellor
;
a
loss
of
which
I
have
since
feel
the
bitter
consequence
;
for
no
great
advantage
,
I
be
convinced
,
can
arrive
to
a
young
man
,
who
hath
any
degree
of
understanding
,
than
an
intimate
converse
with
one
of
riper
year

who
be
not
only
able
to
advise
,

who
know
the
manner
of
advise
.
<EOS>
by
this
mean
alone
,
youth
can
enjoy
the
benefit
of
the
experience
of
age
,
and
that
at
a
time
of
life
when
such
experience
will
be
of
more
service
to
a
man
than
when
he
hath
live
long
enough
to
acquire
it
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
from
want
of
my
sage
counsellor
,
I
now
fall
into
many
error
.
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
be
in
enlarge
my
business
,
by
add
a
farm
of
one
hundred
a
year
to
the
parsonage
,
in
renting
which
I
have
also
as
bad
a
bargain
as
the
doctor
have
before
give
me
a
good
one
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
which
be
,
that
whereas
,
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
,
I
be
worth
upwards
of
fourscore
pound
;
at
the
end
of
the
second
I
be
near
half
<EOS>
that
sum
worse
(
as
the
phrase
be
)
than
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
second
folly
I
be
guilty
of
in
unite
family
with
the
curate
of
the
parish
,
who
have
just
marry
,
as
my
wife
and
I
think
,
a
very
good
sort
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
,
however
,
live
one
month
together
before
I
plainly
perceive
this
good
sort
of
a
woman
have
take
a
great
prejudice
against
my
Amelia
,
for
which
,
if
I
have
not
know
something
of
the
human
passion
,
and
that
high
place
which
envy
hold
among
them
,
I
should
not
have
be
able
to
account
,
for
,
<EOS>
so
far
be
my
angel
from
have
give
her
any
cause
of
dislike
,
that
she
have
treat
her
not
only
with
civility
,
but
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
"
besides
superiority
in
beauty
,
which
,
I
believe
,
all
the
world
would
have
allow
to
Amelia
,
there
be
another
cause
of
this
envy
,
which
I
be
almost
ashamed
to
mention
,
as
it
may
well
be
call
my
great
folly
.
<EOS>
You
be
to
know
then
,
madam
,
that
from
a
boy
I
have
be
always
fond
of
drive
a
coach
,
in
which
I
value
myself
on
have
some
skill
.
<EOS>
this
,
perhaps
,
be
an
innocent
,
but
I
allow
it
to
have
be
a
childish
vanity
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
an
opportunity
,
therefore
,
of
buy
an
old
coach
and
harness
very
cheap
(
indeed
they
cost
me
but
twelve
pound
)
,
and
as
I
consider
that
the
same
horse
which
draw
my
waggon
would
likewise
draw
my
coach
,
I
resolve
on
indulge
myself
in
the
purchase
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
consequence
of
set
up
this
poor
old
coach
be
inconceivable
.
<EOS>
before
this
,
as
my
wife
and
myself
have
very
little
distinguished
ourselves
from
the
other
farmer
and
their
wife
,
either
in
our
dress
or
our
way
of
living
,
they
treat
us
as
their
equal
;
but
now
they
begin
to
consider
us
as
elevate
ourselves
into
a
state
of
superiority
,
and
immediately
begin
to
envy
,
hate
,
and
declare
war
against
us
.
<EOS>
the
neighbour
little
squire
,
too
,
be
uneasy
to
see
a
poor
renter
become
their
equal
in
a
matter
in
which
they
place
so
much
dignity
;
and
,
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
it
arise
in
me
from
the
same
ostentation
,
they
begin
to
hate
me
likewise
,
and
to
turn
my
equipage
into
ridicule
,
assert
that
my
horse
,
which
be
as
well
match
as
any
in
the
kingdom
,
be
of
different
colour
and
size
,
with
much
more
of
that
kind
of
wit
,
the
only
basis
of
which
be
lie
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
will
appear
most
surprizing
to
you
,
madam
,
be
,
that
the
curate
's
wife
,
who
,
be
lame
,
have
more
use
of
the
coach
than
my
Amelia
(
indeed
she
seldom
go
to
church
in
any
other
manner
)
,
be
one
of
my
bitter
enemy
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
ever
any
dispute
with
Amelia
,
which
all
the
sweetness
of
my
poor
girl
could
not
sometimes
avoid
,
she
be
sure
to
introduce
with
a
malicious
sneer
,
"
though
my
husband
doth
not
keep
a
coach
,
madam
.
"
<EOS>
nay
,
she
take
this
opportunity
to
upbraid
my
wife
with
the
loss
of
her
fortune
,
alledge
that
some
folk
may
have
have
as
good
pretension
to
a
coach
as
other
folk
,
and
a
better
too
,
as
they
bring
a
well
fortune
to
their
husband
,
but
that
all
people
have
not
the
art
of
make
brick
without
straw
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
wonder
,
perhaps
,
madam
,
how
I
can
remember
such
stuff
,
which
,
indeed
,
be
a
long
time
only
matter
of
amusement
to
both
Amelia
and
myself
;
but
we
at
last
experience
the
mischievous
nature
of
envy
,
and
that
it
tend
rather
to
produce
tragical
than
comical
event
.
<EOS>
My
neighbour
now
begin
to
conspire
against
me
.
<EOS>
They
nickname
me
in
derision
,
the
Squire
Farmer
.
<EOS>
whatever
I
buy
,
I
be
sure
to
buy
dearer
,
and
when
I
sell
I
be
oblige
to
sell
cheap
,
than
any
other
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
they
be
all
united
,
and
,
while
they
every
day
commit
trespass
on
my
land
with
impunity
,
if
any
of
my
cattle
escape
into
their
field
,
I
be
either
force
to
enter
into
a
law
-
suit
or
to
make
amend
fourfold
for
the
damage
sustain
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
consequence
of
all
this
could
be
no
other
than
that
ruin
which
ensue
.
<EOS>
without
tire
you
with
particular
,
before
the
end
of
four
year
I
become
involved
in
debt
near
three
hundred
pound
more
than
the
value
of
all
my
effect
.
<EOS>
My
landlord
seize
my
stock
for
rent
,
and
,
to
avoid
immediate
confinement
in
prison
,
I
be
force
to
leave
the
country
with
all
that
I
hold
dear
in
the
world
,
my
wife
and
my
poor
little
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
this
condition
I
arrive
in
town
five
or
six
day
ago
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
take
a
lodging
in
the
verge
of
the
court

have
writ

my

Amelia
word
where

may
find

when

have
settle
her
affair

good

very
evening

BOOK

very
mysterious
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matthews
do
not
in
the
least
fall
short
of
Mr.
Booth
in
expression
of
tenderness
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
,
the
most
eloquent
orator
on
such
occasion
,
exert
their
utmost
force
;
and
at
the
conclusion
of
his
speech
she
cast
a
look
as
languishingly
sweet
as
ever
Cleopatra
give
to
Antony
.
<EOS>
in
real
fact
,
this
Mr.
Booth
have
be
her
first
love
,
and
have
make
those
impression
on
her
young
heart
,
which
the
learn
in
this
branch
of
philosophy
affirm
,
and
perhaps
truly
,
be
never
to
be
eradicate
.
  
<EOS>
when
Booth
have
finish
his
story
a
silence
ensue
of
some
minute
;
an
interval
which
the
painter
would
describe
much
well
than
the
writer
.
<EOS>
some
reader
may
,
however
,
be
able
to
make
pretty
pertinent
conjecture
by
what
I
have
say
above
,
especially
when
they
be
tell
that
Miss
Matthews
break
the
silence
by
a
sigh
,
and
cry
,
"
why
be
Mr.
Booth
unwilling
to
allow
me
the
happiness
of
think
my
misfortune
have
be
of
some
little
advantage
to
him
?
<EOS>
sure
the
happy
Amelia
would
not
be
so
selfish
to
envy
me
that
pleasure
.
<EOS>
no
;
not
if
she
be
as
much
the
fond
as
she
be
the
happy
of
woman

"
<EOS>
"
good
heavens
!
<EOS>
madam
<EOS>
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
you
call
my
poor
Amelia
the
happy
of
woman

"
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
do
,

answer
she
briskly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
o
Mr.
Booth
!
<EOS>
there
be
a
speck
of
white
in
her
fortune
,
which
,
when
it
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
sensible
woman

make
her
full
amend
for
all
the
crosse
which
can
attend
her

<EOS>
perhaps
she
may
not
be
sensible
of
it
;
but
if
it
have
be
my
bl
fate
 
o
Mr.
Booth

<EOS>
could
I
have
think
,
when
we
be
first
acquaint
,
that
the
most
agreeable
man
in
the

have
be
capable
of
make
the
kind

the
tender

the
affectionate

happy
Amelia

in
those
day
,
be
unknown

Heaven
have
not
then
give
her
a
prospect
of
the
happiness
it
intend
her
;
but
yet
it
do
intend
it
her
;
for
sure
there
be
a
fatality
in
the
affair
of
love

the
more
I
reflect
on
my
own
life

it

world
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Booth
here
make
a
low
bow
,
and
cry
,
"
<EOS>
o
dear
madam
<EOS>
,
how
ignorant
be
I
of
my
own
happiness
!
"
<EOS>
"
Would
you
really
have
think
so
?
"
answer
she
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
some
politeness
if
there
be
no
sincerity
in
what
you
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
here
the
governor
of
the
enchanted
castle
interrupt
them
,
and
,
enter
the
room
without
any
ceremony
,
acquaint
the
lady
and
gentleman
that
it
be
lock
-
up
time
;
and
,
address
Booth
by
the
name
of
captain
,
ask
him
if
he
would
not
please
to
have
a
bed
;
add
,
that
he
may
have
one
in
the
next
room
to
the
lady
,
but
that
it
would
come
dear
;
for
that
he
never
let
a
bed
in
that
room
under
a
guinea
,
nor
could
he
afford
it
cheap
to
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
no
answer
be
make
to
this
proposal
;
but
Miss
Matthews
,
who
have
already
learn
some
of
the
way
of
the
house
,
say
she
believe
Mr.
Booth
would
like
to
drink
a
glass
of
something
;
upon
which
the
governor
immediately
trumpet
forth
the
praise
of
his
rack
-
punch
,
and
,
without
wait
for
any
farther
command
,
presently
produce
a
large
bowl
of
that
liquor
.
  
<EOS>
the
governor
,
have
recommend
the
goodness
of
his
punch
by
a
hearty
draught
,
begin
to
revive
the
other
matter
,
say
that
he
be
just
go
to
bed
,
and
must
first
lock
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
suppose
,
"
say
Miss
Matthews
,
with
a
smile
,
"
the
captain
and
I
should
have
a
mind
to
sit
up
all
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
with
all
my
heart
,
"
say
the
governor
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
expect
a
consideration
for
those
matter
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
do
not
enquire
into
what
doth
not
concern
me
;
but
single
and
double
be
two
thing
.
<EOS>
if
I
lock
up
double
I
expect
half
a
guinea
,
and
I
be
sure
the
captain
can
not
think
that
be
out
of
the
way
;
it
be
but
the
price
of
a
bagnio
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matthews
's
face
become
the
colour
of
scarlet
at
those
word
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
muster
up
her
spirit
,
and
,
turn
to
Booth
,
say
,
"
what
say
you
,
captain
?
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
never
less
inclination
to
sleep
;
which
hath
the
great
charm
for
you
,
the
punch
or
the
pillow
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
madam
,
"
answer
Booth
,
"
you
have
a
well
opinion
of
me
than
to
doubt
my
prefer
Miss
Matthews
's
conversation
to
either
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
"
reply
she
,
"
it
be
no
compliment
to
you
to
say
I
prefer
your
to
sleep
at
this
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
governor
,
then
,
have
receive
his
fee
,
depart
;
and
,
turn
the
key
,
leave
the
gentleman
and
the
lady
to
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
in
imitation
of
him
we
will
lock
up
likewise
a
scene
which
we
do
not
think
proper
to
expose
to
the
eye
of
the
public
.
<EOS>
if
any
over
-
curious
reader
should
be
disappoint
on
this
occasion
,
we
will
recommend
such
reader
to
the
apology
with
which
certain
gay
lady
have
lately
be
pleased
to
oblige
the
world
,
where
they
will
possibly
find
everything
record
that
past
at
this
interval
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
though
we
decline
paint
the
scene
,
it
be
not
our
intention
to
conceal
from
the
world
the
frailty
of
Mr.
Booth
,
or
of
his
fair
partner
,
who
certainly
past
that
evening
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
strict
rule
of
virtue
and
chastity
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
we
be
much
more
concerned
for
the
behaviour
of
the
gentleman
than
of
the
lady
,
not
only
for
his
sake
,
but
for
the
sake
of
the
good
woman
in
the
world
,
whom
we
should
be
sorry
to
consider
as
yoke
to
a
man
of
no
worth
nor
honour
.
<EOS>
We
desire
,
therefore
,
the
good
-
natured
and
candid
reader
will
be
pleased
to
weigh
attentively
the
several
unlucky
circumstance
which
concur
so
critically
,
that
Fortune
seem
to
have
use
her
utmost
endeavour
to
ensnare
poor
Booth
's
constancy
.
<EOS>
let
the
reader
set
before
his
eye
a
fine
young
woman
,
in
a
manner
,
a
first
love
,
confer
obligation
and
use
every
art
to
soften
,
to
allure
,
to
win
,
and
to
enflame
;
let
him
consider
the
time
and
place
;
let
him
remember
that
Mr.
Booth
be
a
young
fellow
in
the
high
vigour
of
life
;
and
,
lastly
,
let
him
add
one
single
circumstance
,
that
the
party
be
alone
together
;
and
then
,
if
he
will
not
acquit
the
defendant
,
he
must
be
convict
,
for
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
in
his
defence
.
    
<EOS>
the
latter
part
of
which
we
expect
will
please
our
reader
better
than
the
former
.
 
<EOS>
a
whole
week
do
our
lady
and
gentleman
live
in
this
criminal
conversation
,
in
which
the
happiness
of
the
former
be
much
more
perfect
than
that
of
the
latter
;
for
,
though
the
charm
of
Miss
Matthews
,
and
her
excessive
endearment
,
sometimes
lull
every
thought
in
the
sweet
lethargy
of
pleasure
,
yet
in
the
interval
of
his
fit
his
virtue
alarm
and
rouse
him
,
and
bring
the
image
of
poor
injure
Amelia
to
haunt
and
torment
him
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
if
we
regard
this
world
only
,
it
be
the
interest
of
every
man
to
be
either
perfectly
good
or
completely
bad
.
<EOS>
He
have
better
destroy
his
conscience
than
gently
wound
it
.
<EOS>
the
many
bitter
reflection
which
every
bad
action
cost
a
mind
in
which
there
be
any
remain
of
goodness
be
not
to
be
compensate
by
the
high
pleasure
which
such
an
action
can
produce
.
  
<EOS>
so
it
happen
to
Mr.
Booth
.
<EOS>
Repentance
never
fail
to
follow
his
transgression
;
and
yet
so
perverse
be
our
judgment
,
and
so
slippery
be
the
descent
of
vice
when
once
we
be
enter
into
it
,
the
same
crime
which
he
now
repent
of
become
a
reason
for
do
that
which
be
to
cause
his
future
repentance
;
and
he
continue
to
sin
on
because
he
have
begin
.
<EOS>
His
repentance
,
however
,
return
still
heavier
and
heavier
,
till
,
at
last
,
it
fling
him
into
a
melancholy
,
which
Miss
Matthews
plainly
perceive
,
and
at
which
she
could
not
avoid
express
some
resentment
in
obscure
hint
and
ironical
compliment
on
Amelia
's
superiority
to
her
whole
sex
,
who
could
not
cloy
a
gay
young
fellow
by
many
year
'
possession
.
<EOS>
She
would
then
repeat
the
compliment
which
other
have
make
to
her
own
beauty
,
and
could
not
forbear
once
cry
out
,
"
upon
my
soul
,
my
dear
Billy
,
I
believe
the
chief
disadvantage
on
my
side
be
my
superior
fondness
;
for
love
,
in
the
mind
of
man
,
hath
one
quality
,
at
least
,
of
a
fever
,
which
be
to
prefer
coldness
in
the
object
.
<EOS>
confess
,
dear
will
,
be
there
not
something
vastly
refreshing
in
the
cool
air
of
a
prude
?
"
<EOS>
Booth
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
and
beg
her
never
more
to
mention
Amelia
's
name
.
"
<EOS>
o
Will
,
"
cry
she
,
"
do
that
request
proceed
from
the
motive
I
could
wish
<EOS>
,
I
should
be
the
happy
of
womankind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
,
sure
,
madam
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
desire
a
sacrifice
which
I
must
be
a
villain
to
make
to
any
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
desire
!
"
<EOS>
answer
she
,
"
be
there
any
bound
to
the
desire
of
love
?
<EOS>
have
not
I
be
sacrifice
?
<EOS>
hath
<EOS>
not
my
first
love
be
tear
from
my
bleed
heart
?
<EOS>
I
claim
a
prior
right
.
<EOS>
as
for
sacrifice
,
I
can
make
them
too
,
and
would
sacrifice
the
whole
world
at
the
least
call
of
my
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
she
deliver
a
letter
to
Booth
,
which
she
have
receive
within
an
hour
,
the
content
of
which
be
these
:
    
"
DEAREST
MADAM
,
 
those
only
who
truly
know
what
love
be
,
can
have
any
conception
of
the
horror
I
feel
at
hearing
of
your
confinement
at
my
arrival
in
town
,
which
be
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
immediately
send
my
lawyer
to
enquire
into
the
particular
,
who
bring
me
the
agreeable
news
that
the
man
,
whose
heart
's
blood
ought
not
to
be
value
at
the
rate
of
a
single
hair
of
yours
,
be
entirely
out
of
all
danger
,
and
that
you
may
be
admit
to
bail
.
<EOS>
I
presently
order
him
to
go
with
two
of
my
tradesman
,
who
be
to
be
bind
in
any
sum
for
your
appearance
,
if
he
should
be
mean
enough
to
prosecute
you
.
<EOS>
though
you
may
expect
my
attorney
with
you
soon
,
I
would
not
delay
send
this
,
as
I
hope
the
news
will
be
agreeable
to
you
.
<EOS>
My
chariot
will
attend
at
the
same
time
to
carry
you
wherever
you
please
.
<EOS>
You
may
easily
guess
what
a
violence
I
have
do
to
myself
in
not
wait
on
you
in
person
;
but
I
,
who
know
your
delicacy
,
fear
it
may
offend
,
and
that
you
may
think
me
ungenerous
enough
to
hope
from
your
distress
that
happiness
which
I
be
resolve
to
owe
to
your
free
gift
alone
,
when
your
good
nature
shall
induce
you
to
bestow
on
me
what
no
man
live
can
merit
.
<EOS>
I
beg
you
will
pardon
all
the
content
of
this
hasty
letter
,
and
do
me
the
honour
of
believe
me
,
              
Dearest
madam
,
                      
Your
most
passionate
admirer
,
                         
and
most
obedient
humble
servant
,
                                              
DAMON
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
think
he
have
somewhere
before
see
the
same
hand
,
but
in
his
present
hurry
of
spirit
could
not
recollect
whose
it
be
,
nor
do
the
lady
give
him
any
time
for
reflection
;
for
he
have
scarce
read
the
letter
when
she
produce
a
little
bit
of
paper
and
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
here
,
sir
,
here
be
the
content
which
he
fear
will
offend
me
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
put
a
bank
-
bill
of
a
hundred
pound
into
Mr.
Booth
's
hand
,
and
ask
him
with
a
smile
if
he
do
not
think
she
have
reason
to
be
offend
with
so
much
insolence
?
  
<EOS>
before
Booth
could
return
any
answer
the
governor
arrive
,
and
introduce
Mr.
Rogers
the
attorney
,
who
acquaint
the
lady
that
he
have
bring
her
discharge
from
her
confinement
,
and
that
a
chariot
wait
at
the
door
to
attend
her
wherever
she
please
.
  
<EOS>
She
receive
the
discharge
from
Mr.
Rogers
,
and
say
she
be
very
much
oblige
to
the
gentleman
who
employ
him
,
but
that
she
would
not
make
use
of
the
chariot
,
as
she
have
no
notion
of
leave
that
wretched
place
in
a
triumphant
manner
;
in
which
resolution
,
when
the
attorney
find
her
obstinate
,
he
withdraw
,
as
do
the
governor
,
with
many
bow
and
as
many
ladyship
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
no
sooner
go
than
Booth
ask
the
lady
why
she
would
refuse
the
chariot
of
a
gentleman
who
have
behave
with
such
excessive
respect
?
<EOS>
She
look
earnestly
upon
him
,
and
cry
,
"
how
unkind
be
that
question
!
<EOS>
do
you
imagine
I
would
go
and
leave
you
in
such
a
situation
?
<EOS>
thou
knowest
but
little
of
Calista
.
<EOS>
why
,
do
you
think
I
would
accept
this
hundred
pound
from
a
man
I
dislike
,
unless
it
be
to
be
serviceable
to
the
man
I
love
?
<EOS>
I
insist
on
your
take
it
as
your
own
and
use
whatever
you
want
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
protest
in
the
solemn
manner
that
he
would
not
touch
a
shilling
of
it
,
say
,
he
have
already
receive
too
many
obligation
at
her
hand
,
and
more
than
ever
he
should
be
able
,
he
fear
,
to
repay
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
unkind
,
"
answer
she
,
"
be
every
word
you
say
,
why
will
you
mention
obligation
?
<EOS>
love
never
confer
any
.
<EOS>
It
doth
everything
for
its
own
sake
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
therefore
oblige
to
the
man
whose
passion
make
him
generous
;
for
I
feel
how
inconsiderable
the
whole
world
would
appear
to
me
if
I
could
throw
it
after
my
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
much
more
of
this
kind
past
,
she
still
press
the
bank
-
note
upon
him
,
and
he
as
absolutely
refuse
,
till
Booth
leave
the
lady
to
dress
herself
,
and
go
to
walk
in
the
area
of
the
prison
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matthews
now
apply
to
the
governor
to
know
by
what
mean
she
may
procure
the
captain
his
liberty
.
<EOS>
the
governor
answer
,
"
as
he
can
not
get
bail
,
it
will
be
a
difficult
matter
;
and
money
to
be
sure
there
must
be
;
for
people
no
doubt
expect
to
touch
on
these
occasion
.
<EOS>
when
prisoner
have
not
wherewithal
as
the
law
require
to
entitle
themselves
to
justice
,
why
they
must
be
behold
to
other
people
to
give
them
their
liberty
;
and
people
will
not
,
to
be
sure
,
suffer
other
to
be
behold
to
them
for
nothing
,
whereof
there
be
good
reason
;
for
how
should
we
all
live
if
it
be
not
for
these
thing
?
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
how
much
will
it
cost
?
"
<EOS>
"
how
much
!
<EOS>
"
answer
he
,
 
"
how
much
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
let
me
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
he
hesitate
some
time
,
and
then
answer
"
that
for
five
guinea
he
would
undertake
to
procure
the
captain
his
discharge
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
sum
which
he
compute
to
remain
in
the
lady
's
pocket
;
for
,
as
to
the
gentleman
's
,
he
have
long
be
acquaint
with
the
emptiness
of
it

<EOS>
Miss
Matthews
,
to
whom
money
be
as
dirt
(
indeed
she
may
be
think
not
to
have
know
the
value
of
it
)
,
deliver
him
the
bank
-
bill
,
and
bid
him
get
it
change
;
for
if
the
whole
,
say
she

will
procure
him
his
liberty
,
he
shall
have
it
this
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
whole
,
madam
!
<EOS>
"
answer
the
governor
,
as
soon
as
he
have
recover
his
breath
,
for
it
almost
forsook
him
at
the
sight
of
the
black
word
hundred
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
;
there
may
be
people
indeed
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
one
of
those
.
<EOS>
a
hundred
!
<EOS>
no
,
nor
nothing
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
as
I
say
,
I
will
be
content
with
five
guinea
,
and
I
be
sure
that
be
little
enough
.
<EOS>
what
other
people
will
expect
I
can
not
exactly
say
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
his
worship
's
clerk
will
expect
to
touch
pretty
handsomely
;
as
for
his
worship
himself
,
he
never
touch
anything
,
that
is
,
not
to
speak
of
;
but
then
the
constable
will
expect
something
,
and
the
watchman
must
have
something
,
and
the
lawyer
on
both
side
,
they
must
have
their
fee
for
finish
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
leave
all
to
you
.
<EOS>
if
it
cost
me
twenty
pound
I
will
have
him
discharge
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
must
give
his
discharge
into
my
hand
without
let
the
captain
know
anything
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
governor
promise
to
obey
her
command
in
every
particular
;
nay
,
he
be
so
very
industrious
,
that
,
though
dinner
be
just
then
come
upon
the
table
,
at
her
earnest
request
he
set
out
immediately
on
the
purpose
,
and
go
as
he
say
in
pursuit
of
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
other
company
assemble
at
table
as
usual
,
where
poor
Booth
be
the
only
person
out
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
this
be
impute
by
all
present
to
a
wrong
cause
;
nay
,
Miss
Matthews
herself
either
could
not
or
would
not
suspect
that
there
be
anything
deep
than
the
despair
of
be
speedily
discharge
that
lie
heavy
on
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
mirth
of
the
rest
,
and
a
pretty
liberal
quantity
of
punch
,
which
he
swallow
after
dinner
(
for
Miss
Matthews
have
order
a
very
large
bowl
at
her
own
expense
to
entertain
the
good
company
at
her
farewell
)
,
so
far
exhilarate
his
spirit
,
that
when
the
young
lady
and
he
retire
to
their
tea
he
have
all
the
mark
of
gayety
in
his
countenance
,
and
his
eye
sparkle
with
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
and
lady
have
spend
about
two
hour
in
tea
and
conversation
,
when
the
governor
return
,
and
privately
deliver
to
the
lady
the
discharge
for
her
friend
,
and
the
sum
of
eighty
-
two
pound
five
shilling
;
the
rest
have
be
,
he
say
,
disburse
in
the
business
,
of
which
he
be
ready
at
any
time
to
render
an
exact
account
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matthews
be
again
alone
with
Mr.
Booth
<EOS>
,
she
put
the
discharge
into
his
hand
,
desire
him
to
ask
her
no
question
;
and
add
,
"
I
think
,
sir
,
we
have
neither
of
us
now
anything
more
to
do
at
this
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
summon
the
governor
,
and
order
a
bill
of
that
day
's
expense
,
for
long
score
be
not
usual
there
;
and
at
the
same
time
order
a
hackney
coach
,
without
have
yet
determine
whither
she
would
go
,
but
fully
determine
she
be
,
wherever
she
go
,
to
take
Mr.
Booth
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
governor
be
now
approach
with
a
long
roll
of
paper
,
when
a
faint
voice
be
hear
to
cry
out
hastily
,
"
where
be
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
presently
a
female
spectre
,
all
pale
and
breathless
,
rush
into
the
room
,
and
fall
into
Mr.
Booth
's
arm
,
where
she
immediately
faint
away
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
make
a
shift
to
support
his
lovely
burden
;
though
he
be
himself
in
a
condition
very
little
different
from
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Matthews
likewise
,
who
presently
recollect
the
face
of
Amelia
,
be
strike
motionless
with
the
surprize
,
nay
,
the
governor
himself
,
though
not
easily
move
at
sight
of
horror
,
stand
aghast
,
and
neither
offer
to
speak
nor
stir
.
  
<EOS>
happily
for
Amelia
,
the
governess
of
the
mansion
have
,
out
of
curiosity
,
follow
her
into
the
room
,
and
be
the
only
useful
person
present
on
this
occasion
:
she
immediately
call
for
water
,
and
run
to
the
lady
's
assistance
,
fall
to
loosen
her
stay
,
and
perform
all
the
office
proper
at
such
a
season
;
which
have
so
good
an
effect
,
that
Amelia
soon
recover
the
disorder
which
the
violent
agitation
of
her
spirit
have
cause
,
and
find
herself
alive
and
awake
in
her
husband
's
arm
.
  
<EOS>
some
tender
caress
and
a
soft
whisper
or
two
pass
privately
between
Booth
and
his
lady
;
nor
be
it
without
great
difficulty
that
poor
Amelia
put
some
restraint
on
her
fondness
in
a
place
so
improper
for
a
tender
interview
.
<EOS>
She
now
cast
her
eye
round
the
room
,
and
,
fix
them
on
Miss
Matthews
,
who
stand
like
a
statue
,
she
soon
recollect
her
,
and
,
address
her
by
her
name
,
say
,
"
sure
,
madam
,
I
can
not
be
mistake
in
those
feature
;
though
meet
you
here
may
almost
make
me
suspect
my
memory
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matthews
's
face
be
now
all
cover
with
scarlet
.
<EOS>
the
reader
may
easily
believe
she
be
on
no
account
please
with
Amelia
's
presence
;
indeed
,
she
expect
from
her
some
of
those
insult
of
which
virtuous
woman
be
generally
so
liberal
to
a
frail
sister
:
but
she
be
mistaken
;
Amelia
be
not
one
       
<EOS>
who
think
the
nation
ne'er
would
thrive
,
     
<EOS>
till
all
the
whore
be
burn
alive
.
  
<EOS>
Her
virtue
could
support
itself
with
its
own
intrinsic
worth
,
without
borrow
any
assistance
from
the
vice
of
other
woman
;
and
she
consider
their
natural
infirmity
as
the
object
of
pity
,
not
of
contempt
or
abhorrence
.
  
<EOS>
when
Amelia
therefore
perceive
the
visible
confusion
in
Miss
Matthews
she
presently
call
to
remembrance
some
story
which
she
have
imperfectly
hear
;
for
,
as
she
be
not
naturally
attentive
to
scandal
,
and
have
keep
very
little
company
since
her
return
to
England
,
she
be
far
from
be
a
mistress
of
the
lady
's
whole
history
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
have
hear
enough
to
impute
her
confusion
to
the
right
cause
;
she
advance
to
her
,
and
tell
her
,
she
be
extremely
sorry
to
meet
her
in
such
a
place
,
but
hope
that
no
very
great
misfortune
be
the
occasion
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matthews
begin
,
by
degree
,
to
recover
her
spirit
.
<EOS>
She
answer
,
with
a
reserved
air
,
"
I
be
much
oblige
to
you
,
madam
,
for
your
concern
;
we
be
all
liable
to
misfortune
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
know
not
why
I
should
be
much
ashamed
of
be
in
any
place
where
I
be
in
such
good
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
Booth
interpose
.
<EOS>
He
have
before
acquaint
Amelia
in
a
whisper
that
his
confinement
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
accident
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
which
bring
this
young
lady
to
this
melancholy
place
be
entirely
determined
;
and
she
be
now
as
absolutely
at
her
liberty
as
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
impute
the
extreme
coldness
and
reserve
of
the
lady
to
the
cause
already
mention
,
advance
still
more
and
more
in
proportion
as
she
draw
back
;
till
the
governor
,
who
have
withdraw
some
time
,
return
,
and
acquaint
Miss
Matthews
that
her
coach
be
at
the
door
;
upon
which
the
company
soon
separate
.
<EOS>
Amelia
and
Booth
go
together
in
Amelia
's
coach
,
and
poor
Miss
Matthews
be
oblige
to
retire
alone
,
after
have
satisfy
the
demand
of
the
governor
,
which
in
one
day
only
have
amount
to
a
pretty
considerable
sum
;
for
he
,
with
great
dexterity
,
proportion
the
bill
to
the
ability
of
his
guest
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
seem
,
perhaps
,
wonderful
to
some
reader
,
that
Miss
Matthews
should
have
maintain
that
cold
reserve
towards
Amelia
,
so
as
barely
to
keep
within
the
rule
of
civility
,
instead
of
embrace
an
opportunity
which
seem
to
offer
of
gain
some
degree
of
intimacy
with
a
wife
whose
husband
she
be
so
fond
of
;
but
,
besides
that
her
spirit
be
entirely
disconcert
by
so
sudden
and
unexpecte
a
disappointment
;
and
besides
the
extreme
horror
which
she
conceive
at
the
presence
of
her
rival
,
there
be
,
I
believe
,
something
so
outrageously
suspicious
in
the
nature
of
all
vice
,
especially
when
join
with
any
great
degree
of
pride
,
that
the
eye
of
those
whom
we
imagine
privy
to
our
failing
be
intolerable
to
us
,
and
we
be
apt
to
aggravate
their
opinion
to
our
disadvantage
far
beyond
the
reality
.
    
<EOS>
contain
wise
observation
of
the
author
,
and
other
matter
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
more
difficult
than
to
lay
down
any
fix
and
certain
rule
for
happiness
;
or
indeed
to
judge
with
any
precision
of
the
happiness
of
other
from
the
knowledge
of
external
circumstance
.
<EOS>
there
be
sometimes
a
little
speck
of
black
in
the
bright
and
gay
colour
of
fortune
,
which
contaminate
and
deaden
the
whole
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
when
all
without
look
dark
and
dismal
,
there
be
often
a
secret
ray
of
light
within
the
mind
,
which
turn
everything
to
real
joy
and
gladness
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
in
the
course
of
my
life
see
many
occasion
to
make
this
observation
,
and
Mr.
Booth
be
at
present
a
very
pregnant
instance
of
its
truth
.
<EOS>
He
be
just
deliver
from
a
prison
,
and
in
the
possession
of
his
beloved
wife
and
child
;
and
(
which
may
be
imagine
greatly
to
augment
his
joy
)
<EOS>
fortune
have
do
all
this
for
him
within
an
hour
,
without
give
him
the
least
warning
or
reasonable
expectation
of
the
strange
reverse
in
his
circumstance
;
and
yet
it
be
certain
that
there
be
very
few
man
in
the
world
more
seriously
miserable
than
he
be
at
this
instant
.
<EOS>
a
deep
melancholy
seize
his
mind
,
and
cold
damp
sweat
overspread
his
person
,
so
that
he
be
scarce
animate
;
and
poor
Amelia
,
instead
of
a
fond
warm
husband
,
bestow
her
caress
on
a
dull
lifeless
lump
of
clay
.
<EOS>
He
endeavour
,
however
,
at
first
,
as
much
as
possible
,
to
conceal
what
he
feel
,
and
attempt
what
be
the
hard
of
all
task
,
to
act
the
part
of
a
happy
man
;
but
he
find
no
supply
of
spirit
to
carry
on
this
deceit
,
and
would
have
probably
sink
under
his
attempt
,
have
not
poor
Amelia
's
simplicity
help
him
to
another
fallacy
,
in
which
he
have
much
well
success
.
  
<EOS>
this
worthy
woman
very
plainly
perceive
the
disorder
in
her
husband
's
mind
;
and
,
have
no
doubt
of
the
cause
of
it
,
especially
when
she
see
the
tear
stand
in
his
eye
at
the
sight
of
his
child
,
throw
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
and
,
embrace
him
with
rapturous
fondness
,
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
billy
,
let
nothing
make
you
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Heaven
will
,
I
doubt
not
,
provide
for
us
and
these
poor
babe
.
<EOS>
great
fortune
be
not
necessary
to
happiness
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
can
level
my
mind
with
any
state
;
and
for
those
poor
little
thing
,
whatever
condition
of
life
we
breed
them
to
,
that
will
be
sufficient
to
maintain
them
in
.
<EOS>
how
many
thousand
abound
in
affluence
whose
fortune
be
much
low
than
ours
!
<EOS>
for
it
be
not
from
nature
,
but
from
education
and
habit
,
that
our
want
be
chiefly
derive
.
<EOS>
make
yourself
easy
,
therefore
,
my
dear
love
;
for
you
have
a
wife
who
will
think
herself
happy
with
you
,
and
endeavour
to
make
you
so
,
in
any
situation
.
<EOS>
fear
nothing
,
Billy
,
industry
will
always
provide
us
a
wholesome
meal
;
and
I
will
take
care
<EOS>
that
neatness
and
chearfulness
shall
make
it
a
pleasant
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
presently
take
the
cue
which
she
have
give
him
.
<EOS>
He
fix
his
eye
on
her
for
a
minute
with
great
earnestness
and
inexpressible
tenderness
;
and
then
cry
,
"
o
my
Amelia
,
how
much
be
you
my
superior
in
every
perfection
!
<EOS>
how
wise
,
how
great
,
how
noble
be
your
sentiment
!
<EOS>
why
can
I
not
imitate
what
I
so
much
admire
?
<EOS>
why
can
I
not
look
with
your
constancy
on
those
dear
little
pledge
of
our
love
?
<EOS>
all
my
philosophy
be
baffle
with
the
thought
that
my
Amelia
's
child
be
to
struggle
with
a
cruel
,
hard
,
unfeele
world
,
and
to
buffet
those
wave
of
fortune
which
have
overwhelm
their
father
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
I
own
<EOS>
I
want
your
firmness
,
and
be
not
without
an
excuse
for
want
it
;
for
be
I
not
the
cruel
cause
of
all
your
wretchedness
?
<EOS>
have
I
not
stept
between
you
and
fortune
,
and
be
the
curse
obstacle
to
all
your
greatness
and
happiness
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
say
not
so
,
my
love
,
"
answer
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
great
I
may
have
be
,
but
never
happy
with
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
dear
Billy
,
I
laugh
at
the
fear
you
formerly
raise
in
me
;
what
seem
so
terrible
at
a
distance
<EOS>
,
now
it
approach
nearer
,
appear
to
have
be
a
mere
bugbear
 
and
let
this
comfort
you
,
that
I
look
on
myself
at
this
day
as
the
happy
of
woman
;
nor
have
I
do
anything
which
I
do
not
rejoice
in
,
and
would
,
if
I
have
the
gift
of
prescience
,
do
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
so
overcome
with
this
behaviour
,
that
he
have
no
word
to
answer
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
it
be
difficult
to
find
any
worthy
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
throw
himself
prostrate
at
her
foot
,
whence
<EOS>
poor
Amelia
be
force
to
use
all
her
strength
as
well
as
entreaty
to
raise
and
place
him
in
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
ever
the
fortitude
of
perfect
innocence
,
and
such
the
depression
of
guilt
in
mind
not
utterly
abandon
.
<EOS>
Booth
be
naturally
of
a
sanguine
temper
;
nor
would
any
such
apprehension
as
he
mention
have
be
sufficient
to
have
restrain
his
joy
at
meeting
with
his
Amelia
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
a
reflection
on
the
injury
he
have
do
her
be
the
sole
cause
of
his
grief
.
<EOS>
this
it
be
that
enervate
his
heart
,
and
throw
him
into
agony
,
which
all
that
profusion
of
heroic
tenderness
that
the
most
excellent
of
woman
intend
for
his
comfort
serve
only
to
heighten
and
aggravate
;
as
the
more
she
rise
in
his
admiration
,
the
more
she
quicken
his
sense
of
his
own
unworthiness
.
<EOS>
after
a
disagreeable
evening
,
the
first
of
that
kind
that
he
have
ever
pass
with
his
Amelia
,
in
which
he
have
the
utmost
difficulty
to
force
a
little
chearfulness
,
and
in
which
her
spirit
be
at
length
overpower
by
discern
the
oppression
on
his
,
they
retire
to
rest
,
or
rather
to
misery
,
which
nee
not
be
describe
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
,
Booth
begin
to
recover
a
little
from
his
melancholy
,
and
to
taste
the
company
of
his
child
.
<EOS>
He
now
first
thought
of
enquire
of
Amelia
by
what
mean
she
have
discover
the
place
of
his
confinement
.
<EOS>
Amelia
,
after
gently
rebuke
him
for
not
have
himself
acquaint
her
with
it
,
inform
him
that
it
be
know
all
over
the
country
,
and
that
she
have
trace
the
original
of
it
to
her
sister
;
who
have
spread
the
news
with
a
malicious
joy
,
and
add
a
circumstance
which
would
have
frighten
her
to
death
,
have
not
her
knowledge
of
him
make
her
give
little
credit
to
it
,
which
be
,
that
he
be
commit
for
murder
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
she
have
discredit
this
part
,
she
say
the
not
hear
from
him
during
several
successive
post
make
her
too
apprehensive
of
the
rest
;
that
she
get
a
conveyance
therefore
for
herself
and
child
to
Salisbury
,
from
whence
the
stage
coach
have
bring
them
to
town
;
and
,
have
deposit
the
child
at
his
lodging
,
of
which
he
have
send
her
an
account
on
his
first
arrival
in
town
,
she
take
a
hack
,
and
come
directly
to
the
prison
where
she
hear
he
be
,
and
where
she
find
him
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
excuse
himself
,
and
with
truth
,
as
to
his
not
have
writ
;
for
,
in
fact
,
he
have
writ
twice
from
the
prison
,
though
he
have
mention
nothing
of
his
confinement
;
but
,
as
he
send
away
his
letter
after
nine
at
night
,
the
fellow
to
whom
they
be
entrust
have
burn
them
both
for
the
sake
of
put
the
twopence
in
his
own
pocket
,
or
rather
in
the
pocket
of
the
keeper
of
the
next
gin
-
shop
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
account
which
Amelia
give
him
,
it
serve
rather
to
raise
than
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
suspect
that
some
person
have
see
both
him
and
Miss
Matthews
together
in
the
prison
,
and
have
confound
her
case
with
his
;
and
this
the
circumstance
of
murder
make
the
more
probable
.
<EOS>
but
who
this
person
should
be
he
could
not
guess
.
<EOS>
after
give
himself
,
therefore
,
some
pain
in
form
conjecture
to
no
purpose
,
he
be
force
to
rest
contented
with
his
ignorance
of
the
real
truth
.
  
<EOS>
two
or
three
day
now
pass
without
produce
anything
remarkable
;
unless
it
be
that
Booth
more
and
more
recover
his
spirit
,
and
have
now
almost
regain
his
former
degree
of
chearfulness
,
when
the
follow
letter
arrive
,
again
to
torment
him
:
  
"

<EOS>
Booth
tear
the
letter
with
rage
,
and
throw
it
into
the
fire
,
resolve
never
to
visit
the
lady
more
,
unless
it
be
to
pay
her
the
money
she
have
lend
him
,
which
he
be
determined
to
do
the
very
first
opportunity

for
it

not
at
present
in
his
power

<EOS>
this
letter
throw
him
back
into
his
fit
of
dejection
,
in
which
he
have
not
continue
long
when
a
packet
from
the
country
bring
him
the
following
from
his
friend
Dr
harrison
:
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
                          
Lyons
,
January
21
,
N.
S.
"
though
I
be
now
on
my
return
home
,
I
have
take
up
my
pen
to
communicate
to
you
some
news
I
have
hear
from
England
,
which
give
me
much
uneasiness
,
and
concern
which
I
can
indeed
deliver
my
sentiment
with
much
more
ease
this
way
than
any
other
.
<EOS>
in
my
answer
to
your
last
,
I
very
freely
give
you
my
opinion
,
in
which
it
be
my
misfortune
to
disapprove
of
every
step
you
have
take
;
but
those
be
all
pardonable
error
.
<EOS>
Can
you
be
so
partial
to
yourself
,
upon
cool
and
sober
reflexion
,
to
think
what
I
be
go
to
mention
be
so
?
<EOS>
I
promise
you
,
it
appear
to
me
a
folly
of
so
monstrous
a
kind
,
that
,
have
I
hear
it
from
any
but
a
person
of
the
high
honour
,
I
should
have
reject
it
as
utterly
incredible
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
already
guess
what
I
be
about
to
name
;
since
,
Heaven
forbid
,
your
conduct
should
afford
you
any
choice
of
such
gross
instance
of
weakness
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
then
,
you
have
set
up
an
equipage
.
<EOS>
what
shall
I
invent
in
your
excuse
,
either
to
other
or
to
myself
?
<EOS>
in
truth
,
I
can
find
no
excuse
for
you
,
and
,
what
be
more
,
I
be
certain
you
can
find
none
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
must
deal
therefore
very
plainly
and
sincerely
with
you
.
<EOS>
vanity
be
always
contemptible
;
but
when
join
with
dishonesty
,
it
become
odious
and
detestable
.
<EOS>
at
whose
expence
be
you
to
support
this
equipage
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
entirely
at
the
expence
of
other
?
<EOS>
and
will
it
not
finally
end
in
that
of
your
poor
wife
and
child
?
<EOS>
you
know
you
be
two
year
in
arrear
to
me
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
impute
this
to
any
extraordinary
or
common
accident
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
never
have
mention
it
;
but
I
will
not
suffer
my
money
to
support
the
ridiculous
,
and
,
I
must
say
,
criminal
vanity
of
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
expect
,
therefore
,
to
find
,
at
my
return
,
that
you
have
either
discharge
my
whole
debt
,
or
your
equipage
.
<EOS>
let
me
beg
you
seriously
to
consider
your
circumstance
and
condition
in
life
,
and
to
remember
that
your
situation
will
not
justify
any
the
least
unnecessary
expence
.
<EOS>
simply
to
be
poor
,
say
my
favourite
greek
historian
,
be
not
hold
scandalous
by
the
wise
Athenians
,
but
highly
so
to
owe
that
poverty
to
our
own
indiscretion
.
  
<EOS>
"
present
my
affection
to
Mrs.
Booth
,
and
be
assure
that
I
shall
not
,
without
great
reason
,
and
great
pain
too
,
ever
cease
to
be

"
  
have
this
letter
come
at
any
other
time
,
it
would
have
give
Booth
the
most
sensible
affliction
;
but
so
totally
have
the
affair
of
Miss
Matthews
possess
his
mind
,
that
,
like
a
man
in
the
most
rage
fit
of
the
gout
,
he
be
scarce
capable
of
any
additional
torture
<EOS>
;
nay
,
he
even
make
an
use
of
this
latter
epistle
,
as
it
serve
to
account
to
Amelia
for
that
concern
which
he
really
feel
on
another
account
.
<EOS>
the
poor
deceive
lady
,
therefore
,
apply
herself
to
give
him
comfort
where
he
least
want
it
.
<EOS>
She
say
he
may
easily
perceive
that
the
matter
have
be
misrepresent
to
the
doctor
,
who
would
not
,
she
be
sure
,
retain
the
least
anger
against
him
when
he
know
the
real
truth
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
conversation
on
this
subject
,
in
which
Booth
appear
to
be
greatly
console
by
the
argument
of
his
wife
,
they
part
.
<EOS>
He
go
to
take
a
walk
in
the
Park
,
and
she
remain
at
home
to
prepare
him
his
dinner

<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
depart
than
his
little
boy
,
not
quite
six
year
old
,
say
to
Amelia
,
"
La

<EOS>
mamma
,
what
be
the
matter
with
poor
papa

what
make
him
look
so
as
if
he
be

to
cry

<EOS>
he
be
not
half
so
merry
as
he
use
to
be
in
the
country
.

"
<EOS>
Amelia
answer
,
"
oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
your
papa
be
only
a
little
thoughtful
,
he
will
be
merry
again
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
look
fondly
on
her
child
,
she
burst
into
an
agony
of
tear
,
and
cry
,
"
oh
Heavens
;
what
have
these
poor
little
infant
do
?
<EOS>
why
will
the
barbarous
world
endeavour
to
starve
them
,
by
deprive
us
of
our
only
friend

<EOS>
o
<EOS>
my
dear
,
your
father
be
ruin

and
we
be
undone
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
child
presently
accompany
their
mother
's
tear
,
and
the
daughter
cry
 
"
why
,
will
anybody
hurt
poor
papa
?
<EOS>
hath
<EOS>
he
do
any
harm
to
anybody

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
child

"
say
the
mother
;
"
he
be
the
good
man
in
the
world
,
and
therefore
they
hate
him
.
<EOS>
"
upon
which
the
boy
,
who
be
extremely
sensible
at
his
year
,
answer
,
"
Nay
,
mamma
,
how
can
that
be
?
<EOS>
have
not
you
often
tell
me
that
if
I
be
good
everybody
would
love
me
?
"
<EOS>
"
all
good
people
will

answer
she
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
they
love
papa
then

<EOS>
"
reply
the
child
,
"
for
I
be
sure
he
be
very
good

"
<EOS>
"
so
they
do
,
my
dear

say
the
mother

"

there
be
more
bad
people
in
the
world

they

<EOS>
"
why

bad

cry
the

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no

my

say
she
;
"
the
love
of
one
good

there

no
such
person

still
you

for
there
be
one

who
will
love
you

and
his
love
be
well
for
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
little
dialogue
,
we
be
apprehensive
,
will
be
read
with
contempt
by
many
;
indeed
,
we
should
not
have
think
it
worth
recording
,
be
it
not
for
the
excellent
example
which
Amelia
here
give
to
all
mother
.
<EOS>
this
admirable
woman
never
let
a
day
pass
without
instruct
her
child
in
some
lesson
of
religion
and
morality
.
<EOS>
by
which
mean
she
have
,
in
their
tender
mind
,
so
strongly
annex
the
idea
of
fear
and
shame
to
every
idea
of
evil
of
which
they
be
susceptible
,
that
it
must
require
great
pain
and
length
of
habit
to
separate
them
.
<EOS>
though
she
be
the
tender
of
mother
,
she
never
suffer
any
symptom
of
malevolence
to
shew
itself
in
their
most
trifling
action
without
discouragement
,
without
rebuke
,
and
,
if
it
break
forth
with
any
rancour
,
without
punishment
.
<EOS>
in
which
she
have
such
success
,
that
not
the
least
mark
of
pride
,
envy
,
malice
,
or
spite
discover
itself
in
any
of
their
little
word
or
deed
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Amelia
appear
in
no
unamiable
light
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
,
with
the
assistance
of
a
little
girl
,
who
be
their
only
servant
,
have
dr
her
dinner
,
and
she
have
likewise
dr
herself
as
neat
as
any
lady
who
have
a
regular
sett
of
servant
could
have
do
,
when
Booth
return
,
and
bring
with
him
his
friend
James
,
whom
he
have
meet
with
in
the
Park
;
and
who
,
as
Booth
absolutely
refuse
to
dine
away
from
his
wife
,
to
whom
he
have
promise
to
return
,
have
invite
himself
to
dine
with
him
.
<EOS>
Amelia
have
none
of
that
paultry
pride
which
possess
so
many
of
her
sex
,
and
which
disconcert
their
temper
,
and
give
them
the
air
and
look
of
fury
,
if
their
husband
bring
in
an
unexpected
guest
,
without
give
them
timely
warn
to
provide
a
sacrifice
to
their
own
vanity
.
<EOS>
Amelia
receive
her
husband
's
friend
with
the
utmost
complaisance
and
good
humour
:
she
make
indeed
some
apology
for
the
homeliness
of
her
dinner
;
but
it
be
politely
turn
as
a
compliment
to
Mr.
James
's
friendship
,
which
could
carry
him
where
he
be
sure
of
be
so
ill
entertain
;
and
give
not
the
least
hint
how
magnificently
she
would
have
provide
<EOS>
have
she
expect
the
favour
of
so
much
good
company
.
<EOS>
a
phrase
which
be
generally
mean
to
contain
not
only
an
apology
for
the
lady
of
the
house
,
but
a
tacit
satire
on
her
guest
for
their
intrusion
,
and
be
at
least
a
strong
insinuation
that
they
be
not
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
fail
not
to
enquire
very
earnestly
after
her
old
friend
Mrs.
James
,
formerly
Miss
Bath
,
and
be
very
sorry
to
find
that
she
be
not
in
town
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
as
James
have
marry
out
of
a
violent
liking
of
,
or
appetite
to
,
her
person
,
possession
have
surfeit
him
,
and
he
be
now
grow
so
heartily
tired
of
his
wife
,
that
she
have
very
little
of
his
company
;
she
be
force
therefore
to
content
herself
with
be
the
mistress
of
a
large
house
and
equipage
in
the
country
ten
month
in
the
year
by
herself
.
<EOS>
the
other
two
he
indulge
her
with
the
diversion
of
the
town
;
<EOS>
but
then
,
though
they
lodge
under
the
same
roof
,
she
have
little
more
of
her
husband
's
society
than
if
they
have
be
one
hundred
mile
apart
.
<EOS>
with
all
this
,
as
she
be
a
woman
of
calm
passion
,
she
make
herself
content
;
for
she
have
never
have
any
violent
affection
for
James
:
the
match
be
of
the
prudent
kind
,
and
to
her
advantage
;
for
his
fortune
,
by
the
death
of
an
uncle
,
be
become
very
considerable
;
and
she
have
gain
everything
by
the
bargain
but
a
husband
,
which
her
constitution
suffer
her
to
be
very
well
satisfied
without
.
  
<EOS>
when
Amelia
,
after
dinner
,
retire
to
her
child
,
James
begin
to
talk
to
his
friend
concern
his
affair
.
<EOS>
He
advise
Booth
very
earnestly
to
think
of
get
again
into
the
army
,
in
which
he
himself
have
meet
with
such
success
,
that
he
have
obtain
the
command
of
a
regiment
to
which
his
brother
-
in
-
law
be
lieutenant
-
colonel
.
<EOS>
these
preferment
they
both
owe
to
the
favour
of
fortune
only
;
for
,
though
there
be
no
objection
to
either
of
their
military
character
,
yet
neither
of
them
have
any
extraordinary
desert
;
and
,
if
merit
in
the
service
be
a
sufficient
recommendation
,
Booth
,
who
have
be
twice
wound
in
the
siege
,
seem
to
have
the
fair
pretension
;
but
he
remain
a
poor
half
-
pay
lieutenant
,
and
the
other
be
,
as
we
have
say
,
one
of
them
a
lieutenant
-
colonel
,
and
the
other
have
a
regiment
.
<EOS>
such
rise
we
often
see
in
life
,
without
be
able
to
give
any
satisfactory
account
of
the
mean
,
and
therefore
ascribe
them
to
the
good
fortune
of
the
person
.
  
<EOS>
both
Colonel
James
and
his
brother
-
in
-
law
be
member
of
parliament
;
for
,
as
the
uncle
of
the
former
have
leave
him
,
together
with
his
estate
,
an
almost
certain
interest
in
a
borough
,
so
he
choose
to
confer
this
favour
on
Colonel
Bath
;
a
circumstance
which
would
have
be
highly
immaterial
to
mention
here
,
but
as
it
serve
to
set
forth
the
goodness
of
James
,
who
endeavour
to
make
up
in
kindness
to
the
family
what
he
want
in
fondness
for
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Colonel
James
then
endeavour
all
in
his
power
to
persuade
Booth
to
think
again
of
a
military
life
,
and
very
kindly
offer
him
his
interest
towards
obtain
him
a
company
in
the
regiment
under
his
command
.
<EOS>
Booth
must
have
be
a
madman
,
in
his
present
circumstance
,
to
have
hesitate
one
moment
at
accept
such
an
offer
,
and
he
well
know
Amelia
,
notwithstanding
her
aversion
to
the
army
,
be
much
too
wise
to
make
the
least
scruple
of
give
her
consent
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
,
as
it
appear
afterwards
,
mistake
in
his
opinion
of
his
wife
's
understanding
;
for
she
make
not
the
least
objection
when
it
be
communicate
to
her
,
but
content
herself
with
an
express
stipulation
,
that
wherever
he
be
command
to
go
(
for
the
regiment
be
now
abroad
)
<EOS>
she
would
accompany
him
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
,
therefore
,
accept
his
friend
's
proposal
with
a
profusion
of
acknowledgment
;
and
it
be
agree
that
Booth
should
draw
up
a
memorial
of
his
pretension
,
which
Colonel
James
undertake
to
present
to
some
man
of
power
,
and
to
back
it
with
all
the
force
he
have
.
  
<EOS>
nor
do
the
friendship
of
the
colonel
stop
here
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
excuse
me
,
dear
Booth
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
,
after
what
you
have
tell
me
"
(
for
he
have
be
very
explicit
in
reveal
his
affair
to
him
)
,
"
I
suspect
you
must
want
money
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
if
that
be
the
case
,
as
I
be
certain
it
must
be
,
I
have
fifty
piece
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
this
generosity
bring
the
tear
into
Booth
's
eye
;
and
he
at
length
confest
that
he
have
not
five
guinea
in
the
house
;
upon
which
James
give
him
a
bank
-
bill
for
twenty
pound
,
and
say
he
would
give
him
thirty
more
the
next
time
he
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
thus
do
this
generous
colonel
(
for
generous
he
really
be
to
the
high
degree
)
restore
peace
and
comfort
to
this
little
family
;
and
by
this
act
of
beneficence
make
two
of
the
worthy
people
two
of
the
happy
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
reader
,
give
me
leave
to
stop
a
minute
,
to
lament
that
so
few
be
to
be
find
of
this
benign
disposition
;
that
,
while
wantonness
,
vanity
,
avarice
,
and
ambition
be
every
day
rioting
and
triumphing
in
the
folly
and
weakness
,
the
ruin
and
desolation
of
mankind
,
scarce
one
man
in
a
thousand
be
capable
of
taste
the
happiness
of
other
.
<EOS>
nay
,
give
me
leave
to
wonder
that
pride
,
which
be
constantly
struggle
,
and
often
impose
on
itself
,
to
gain
some
little
pre
-
eminence
,
should
so
seldom
hint
to
us
<EOS>
the
only
certain
as
well
as
laudable
way
of
set
ourselves
above
another
man
,
and
that
be
,
by
become
his
benefactor
.
    
<EOS>
contain
an
eulogium
upon
innocence
,
and
other
grave
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Booth
past
that
evening
,
and
all
the
succeed
day
,
with
his
Amelia
,
without
the
interruption
of
almost
a
single
thought
concern
Miss
Matthews
,
after
have
determine
to
go
on
the
Sunday
,
the
only
day
he
could
venture
without
the
verge
in
the
present
state
of
his
affair
,
and
pay
her
what
she
have
advance
for
him
in
the
prison
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
not
so
long
patience
;
for
the
third
day
,
while
he
be
sit
with
Amelia
,
a
letter
be
bring
to
him
.
<EOS>
as
he
know
the
hand
,
he
immediately
put
it
into
his
pocket
unopened
,
not
without
such
an
alteration
in
his
countenance
,
that
have
Amelia
,
who
be
then
play
with
one
of
the
child
,
cast
her
eye
towards
him
,
she
must
have
remark
it
.
<EOS>
this
accident
,
however
,
luckily
give
him
time
to
recover
himself
;
for
Amelia
be
so
deeply
engaged
with
the
little
one
,
that
she
do
not
even
remark
the
delivery
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
the
maid
soon
after
return
into
the
room
,
say
,
the
chairman
desire
to
know
if
there
be
any
answer
to
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
letter
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Booth
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
letter
I
give
you
just
now
,
"
answer
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
sure
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
the
child
be
mad
,
you
give
me
no
letter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
,
I
do
,
sir
,
"
say
the
poor
girl
.
<EOS>
"
why
then
as
sure
as
fate
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
I
throw
it
into
the
fire
in
my
reverie
;
why
,
child
,
why
do
you
not
tell
me
it
be
a
letter
?
<EOS>
bid
the
chairman
come
up
,
stay
,
I
will
go
down
myself
;
for
he
will
otherwise
dirt
the
stair
with
his
foot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
be
gently
chide
the
girl
for
her
carelessness
when
Booth
return
,
say
it
be
very
true
that
she
have
deliver
him
a
letter
from
Colonel
James
,
and
that
perhaps
it
may
be
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
however
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
step
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
and
send
him
an
account
of
this
strange
accident
,
which
I
know
he
will
pardon
in
my
present
situation
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
overjoy
at
this
escape
,
<EOS>
which
poor
Amelia
's
total
want
of
all
jealousy
and
suspicion
make
it
very
easy
for
him
to
accomplish
;
but
his
pleasure
be
considerably
abate
when
,
upon
open
the
letter
,
he
find
it
to
contain
,
mixed
with
several
very
strong
expression
of
love
,
some
pretty
warm
one
of
the
upbraid
kind
;
but
what
most
alarm
him
be
a
hint
that
it
be
in
her
<EOS>
(
Miss
Matthews
's
)
power
to
make
Amelia
as
miserable
as
herself
.
<EOS>
besides
the
general
knowledge
of
    
Furens
quid
faemina
possit
,
  
he
have
more
particular
reason
to
apprehend
the
rage
of
a
lady
who
have
give
so
strong
an
instance
<EOS>
how
far
she
could
carry
her
revenge
.
<EOS>
She
have
already
send
a
chairman
to
his
lodging
with
a
positive
command
not
to
return
without
an
answer
to
her
letter
.
<EOS>
this
may
of
itself
have
possibly
occasion
a
discovery
;
and
he
think
he
have
great
reason
to
fear
that
,
if
she
do
not
carry
matter
so
far
as
purposely
and
avowedly
to
reveal
the
secret
to
Amelia
,
her
indiscretion
would
at
least
effect
the
discovery
of
that
which
he
would
at
any
price
have
conceal
.
<EOS>
under
these
terror
he
may
,
I
believe
,
be
consider
as
the
most
wretched
of
human
being
.
  
<EOS>
o
innocence
,
<EOS>
how
glorious
and
happy
a
portion
art
thou
to
the
breast
that
possess
thee
!
<EOS>
thou
fearest
neither
the
eye
nor
the
tongue
of
man
.
<EOS>
truth
,
the
most
powerful
of
all
thing
,
be
thy
strong
friend
;
and
the
bright
the
light
be
in
which
thou
art
display
,
the
more
it
discover
thy
transcendent
beauty
.
<EOS>
guilt
,
on
the
contrary
,
like
a
base
thief
,
suspect
every
eye
that
behold
him
to
be
privy
to
his
transgression
,
and
every
tongue
that
mention
his
name
to
be
proclaim
them
.
<EOS>
fraud
and
falsehood
be
his
weak
and
treacherous
ally
;
and
he
lurk
tremble
in
the
dark
,
dread
every
ray
of
light
,
lest
it
should
discover
him
,
and
give
him
up
to
shame
and
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
while
Booth
be
walk
in
the
Park
with
all
these
horror
in
his
mind
he
again
meet
his
friend
Colonel
James
,
who
soon
take
notice
of
that
deep
concern
which
the
other
be
incapable
of
hiding
.
<EOS>
after
some
little
conversation
,
Booth
say
,
"
My
dear
colonel
,
I
be
sure
I
must
be
the
most
insensible
of
man
if
I
do
not
look
on
you
as
the
good
and
the
true
friend
;
I
will
,
therefore
,
without
scruple
,
repose
a
confidence
in
you
of
the
high
kind
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
make
you
privy
to
my
necessity
,
I
will
now
acquaint
you
with
my
shame
,
provide
you
have
leisure
enough
to
give
me
a
hearing
:
for
I
must
open
to
you
a
long
history
,
since
I
will
not
reveal
my
fault
without
inform
you
,
at
the
same
time
,
of
those
circumstance
which
,
I
hope
,
will
in
some
measure
excuse
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
very
readily
agree
to
give
his
friend
a
patient
hearing
.
<EOS>
so
they
walk
directly
to
a
coffee
-
house
at
the
corner
of
Spring
-
Garden
,
where
,
be
in
a
room
by
themselves
,
Booth
open
his
whole
heart
,
and
acquaint
the
colonel
with
his
amour
with
Miss
Matthews
,
from
the
very
beginning
to
his
receiving
that
letter
which
have
cause
all
his
present
uneasiness
,
and
which
he
now
deliver
into
his
friend
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
read
the
letter
very
attentively
twice
over
(
he
be
silent
indeed
long
enough
to
have
read
it
oftener
)
;
and
then
,
turn
to
Booth
,
say
,
"
well
,
sir
,
and
be
it
so
grievous
a
calamity
to
be
the
object
of
a
young
lady
's
affection
;
especially
of
one
whom
you
allow
to
be
so
extremely
handsome
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
but
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
do
not
jest
with
me
;
you
who
know
my
Amelia
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
answer
James
,
"
and
you
know
Amelia
and
this
lady
too
.
<EOS>
but
what
would
you
have
me
do
for
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
you
give
me
your
advice
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
<EOS>
by
what
method
I
shall
get
rid
of
this
dreadful
woman
without
a
discovery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
really
,
"
cry
the
other
,
"
desire
to
get
rid
of
her
?
"
<EOS>
"
Can
you
doubt
it
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
after
what
I
have
communicate
to
you
,
and
after
what
you
yourself
have
see
in
my
family
?
<EOS>
for
I
hope
,
notwithstanding
this
fatal
slip
,
I
do
not
appear
to
you
in
the
light
of
a
profligate
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
answer
James
,
"
and
,
whatever
light
I
may
appear
to
you
in
,
if
you
be
really
tired
of
the
lady
,
and
if
she
be
really
what
you
have
represent
her
,
I
will
endeavour
to
take
her
off
your
hand
;
but
I
insist
upon
it
that
you
do
not
deceive
me
in
any
particular
.
"
<EOS>
Booth
protest
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
every
word
which
he
have
speak
be
strictly
true
;
and
be
ask
whether
he
would
give
his
honour
never
more
to
visit
the
lady
,
he
assure
James
that
he
never
would
.
<EOS>
He
then
,
at
his
friend
's
request
,
deliver
him
Miss
Matthews
's
letter
,
in
which
be
a
second
direction
to
her
lodging
,
and
declare
to
him
that
,
if
he
could
bring
him
safely
out
of
this
terrible
affair
,
he
should
think
himself
to
have
a
still
high
obligation
to
his
friendship
than
any
which
he
have
already
receive
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
press
the
colonel
to
go
home
with
him
to
dinner
;
but
he
excuse
himself
,
be
,
as
he
say
,
already
engage
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
undertake
in
the
afternoon
to
do
all
in
his
power
that
Booth
should
receive
no
more
alarm
from
the
quarter
of
Miss
Matthews
,
whom
the
colonel
undertake
to
pay
all
the
demand
she
have
on
his
friend
.
<EOS>
They
then
separate
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
go
to
dinner
at
the
King
's
arm
,
and
Booth
return
in
high
spirit
to
meet
his
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
early
in
the
morning
,
the
colonel
come
to
the
coffee
-
house
and
send
for
his
friend
,
who
lodge
but
<EOS>
at
a
little
distance
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
tell
him
he
have
a
little
exaggerate
the
lady
's
beauty
;
however
,
he
say
,
he
excuse
that
,
"
for
you
may
think
,
perhaps
,
"
cry
he
,
"
that
your
inconstancy
to
the
fine
woman
in
the
world
may
want
some
excuse
.
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
will
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
may
make
yourself
easy
,
as
it
will
be
,
I
be
convinced
,
<EOS>
your
own
fault
,
if
you
have
ever
any
further
molestation
from
Miss
Matthews
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
pour
forth
very
warmly
a
great
profusion
of
gratitude
on
this
occasion
;
and
nothing
more
anywise
material
pass
at
this
interview
,
which
be
very
short
,
the
colonel
be
in
a
great
hurry
,
as
he
have
,
he
say
,
some
business
of
very
great
importance
to
transact
that
morning
.
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
have
now
see
Booth
twice
without
remember
to
give
him
the
thirty
pound
.
<EOS>
this
the
latter
impute
intirely
to
forgetfulness
;
for
he
have
always
find
the
promise
of
the
former
to
be
equal
in
value
with
the
note
or
bond
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
He
be
more
surprized
at
what
happen
the
next
day
,
when
,
meet
his
friend
in
the
Park
,
he
receive
only
a
cold
salute
from
him
;
and
though
he
past
him
five
or
six
time
,
and
the
colonel
be
walk
with
a
single
officer
of
no
great
rank
,
and
with
whom
he
seem
in
no
earnest
conversation
,
yet
could
not
Booth
,
who
be
alone
,
obtain
any
further
notice
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
give
the
poor
man
some
alarm
;
though
he
could
scarce
persuade
himself
that
there
be
any
design
in
all
this
coldness
or
forgetfulness
.
<EOS>
once
he
imagine
that
he
have
lessen
himself
in
the
colonel
's
opinion
by
have
discover
his
inconstancy
to
Amelia
;
but
the
know
character
of
the
other
presently
cure
him
of
his
suspicion
,
for
he
be
a
perfect
libertine
with
regard
to
woman
;
that
be
indeed
the
principal
blemish
in
his
character
,
which
otherwise
may
have
deserve
much
commendation
for
good
-
nature
,
generosity
,
and
friendship
.
<EOS>
but
he
carry
this
one
to
a
most
unpardonable
height
;
and
make
no
scruple
of
openly
declare
that
,
if
he
ever
like
a
woman
well
enough
to
be
uneasy
on
her
account
,
he
would
cure
himself
,
if
he
could
,
by
enjoy
her
,
whatever
may
be
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
could
not
therefore
be
persuade
that
the
colonel
would
so
highly
resent
in
another
a
fault
of
which
he
be
himself
most
notoriously
guilty
.
<EOS>
after
much
consideration
he
could
derive
this
behaviour
from
nothing
well
than
a
capriciousness
in
his
friend
's
temper
,
from
a
kind
of
inconstancy
of
mind
,
which
make
man
grow
weary
of
their
friend
with
no
more
reason
than
they
often
be
of
their
mistress
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
there
be
jilt
in
friendship
as
well
as
in
love
;
and
,
by
the
behaviour
of
some
man
in
both
,
one
would
almost
imagine
that
they
industriously
seek
to
gain
the
affection
of
other
with
a
view
only
of
make
the
party
miserable
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
consequence
of
the
colonel
's
behaviour
to
Booth
.
<EOS>
former
calamity
have
afflict
him
,
but
this
almost
distract
him
;
and
the
more
so
as
he
be
not
able
well
to
account
for
such
conduct
,
nor
to
conceive
the
reason
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
at
his
return
,
presently
perceive
the
disturbance
in
his
mind
,
though
he
endeavour
with
his
utmost
power
to
hide
it
;
and
he
be
at
length
prevail
upon
by
her
entreaty
to
discover
to
her
the
cause
of
it
,
which
she
no
sooner
hear
than
she
apply
as
judicious
a
remedy
to
his
disorder
spirit
as
either
of
those
great
mental
physician
,
Tully
or
Aristotle
,
could
have
think
of
.
<EOS>
She
use
many
argument
to
persuade
him
that
he
be
in
an
error
,
and
have
mistake
forgetfulness
and
carelessness
for
a
design
neglect
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
this
physic
be
only
eventually
good
,
and
as
its
efficacy
depend
on
her
be
in
the
right
,
a
point
in
which
she
be
not
apt
to
be
too
positive
,
she
think
fit
to
add
some
consolation
of
a
more
certain
and
positive
kind
.
<EOS>
"
Admit
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
my
dear
,
that
Mr.
James
should
prove
the
unaccountable
person
you
have
suspect
,
and
should
,
without
be
able
to
alledge
any
cause
,
withdraw
his
friendship
from
you
(
for
surely
the
accident
of
burn
his
letter
be
too
trifling
and
ridiculous
to
mention
)
,
why
should
this
grieve
you
?
<EOS>
the
obligation
he
hath
confer
on
you
,
I
allow
,
ought
to
make
his
misfortune
almost
your
own
;
but
they
should
not
,
I
think
,
make
you
see
his
fault
so
very
sensibly
,
especially
when
,
by
one
of
the
great
fault
in
the
world
commit
against
yourself
,
he
hath
considerably
lessen
all
obligation
;
for
sure
,
if
the
same
person
who
hath
contribute
to
my
happiness
at
one
time
doth
everything
in
his
power
maliciously
and
wantonly
to
make
me
miserable
at
another
,
I
be
very
little
oblige
to
such
a
person
.
<EOS>
and
let
it
be
a
comfort
to
my
dear
Billy
,
that
,
however
other
friend
may
prove
false
and
fickle
to
him
,
he
hath
one
friend
,
whom
no
inconstancy
of
her
own
,
nor
any
change
of
his
fortune
,
nor
time
,
nor
age
,
nor
sickness
,
nor
any
accident
,
can
ever
alter
;
but
who
will
esteem
,
will
love
,
and
doat
on
him
for
ever
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
fling
her
snowy
arm
about
his
neck
,
and
give
him
a
caress
so
tender
,
that
it
seem
almost
to
balance
all
the
malice
of
his
fate
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
the
behaviour
of
Amelia
would
have
make
him
completely
happy
,
in
defiance
of
all
adverse
circumstance
,
have
it
not
be
for
those
bitter
ingredient
which
he
himself
have
throw
into
his
cup
,
and
which
prevent
him
from
truly
relish
his
Amelia
's
sweetness
,
by
cruelly
remind
him
how
unworthy
he
be
of
this
excellent
creature
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
do
not
long
remain
in
the
dark
as
to
the
conduct
of
James
,
which
,
at
first
,
appear
to
him
to
be
so
great
a
mystery
;
for
this
very
afternoon
he
receive
a
letter
from
Miss
Matthews
which
unravel
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
by
this
letter
,
which
be
full
of
bitterness
and
upbraiding
,
he
discover
that
James
be
his
rival
with
that
lady
,
and
be
,
indeed
,
the
identical
person
who
have
send
the
hundred
-
pound
note
to
Miss
Matthews
,
when
in
the
prison
.
<EOS>
He
have
reason
to
believe
,
likewise
,
as
well
by
the
letter
as
by
other
circumstance
,
that
James
have
hitherto
be
an
unsuccessful
lover
;
for
the
lady
,
though
she
have
forfeit
all
title
to
virtue
,
have
not
yet
so
far
forfeited
all
pretension
to
delicacy
as
to
be
,
like
the
dirt
in
the
street
,
indifferently
common
to
all
.
<EOS>
She
distribute
her
favour
only
to
those
she
like
,
in
which
number
that
gentleman
have
not
the
happiness
of
be
include
.
  
<EOS>
when
Booth
have
make
this
discovery
,
he
be
not
so
little
versed
in
human
nature
,
as
any
longer
to
hesitate
at
the
true
motive
to
the
colonel
's
conduct
;
for
he
well
know
how
odious
a
sight
a
happy
rival
be
to
an
unfortunate
lover
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
,
in
reality
,
glad
to
assign
the
cold
treatment
he
have
receive
from
his
friend
to
a
cause
which
,
however
injustifiable
,
be
at
the
same
time
highly
natural
;
and
to
acquit
him
of
a
levity
,
fickleness
,
and
caprice
,
which
he
must
have
be
unwillingly
oblige
to
have
see
in
a
much
bad
light
.
  
<EOS>
He
now
resolve
to
take
the
first
opportunity
of
accost
the
colonel
,
and
of
come
to
a
perfect
explanation
upon
the
whole
matter
.
<EOS>
He
debate
likewise
with
himself
whether
he
should
not
throw
himself
at
Amelia
's
foot
,
and
confess
a
crime
to
her
which
he
find
so
little
hope
of
concealing
,
and
which
he
foresaw
would
occasion
him
so
many
difficulty
and
terror
to
endeavour
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
Happy
have
it
be
for
him
,
have
he
wisely
pursue
this
step
;
since
,
in
all
probability
,
he
would
have
receive
immediate
forgiveness
from
the
good
of
woman
;
but
he
have
not
sufficient
resolution
,
or
,
to
speak
perhaps
more
truly
,
he
have
too
much
pride
,
to
confess
his
guilt
,
and
prefer
the
danger
of
the
high
inconvenience
to
the
certainty
of
be
put
to
the
blush
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
may
appear
that
violence
be
sometimes
do
to
the
name
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
when
that
happy
day
come
,
in
which
unhallowed
hand
be
forbid
to
contaminate
the
shoulder
of
the
unfortunate
,
Booth
go
early
to
the
colonel
's
house
,
and
,
be
admit
to
his
presence
,
begin
with
great
freedom
,
though
with
great
gentleness
,
to
complain
of
his
not
have
deal
with
him
with
more
openness
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
colonel
,
"
say
he
,
"
would
you
not
acquaint
me
with
that
secret
which
this
letter
hath
disclose
?
"
<EOS>
James
read
the
letter
,
at
which
his
countenance
change
more
than
once
;
and
then
,
after
a
short
silence
,
say
,
"
Mr.
Booth
,
I
have
be
to
blame
,
I
own
it
;
and
you
upbraid
me
with
justice
.
<EOS>
the
true
reason
be
,
that
I
be
ashamed
of
my
own
folly
.
<EOS>
D####n
me
,
Booth
,
if
I
have
not
be
a
most
consummate
fool
,
a
very
dupe
to
this
woman
;
and
she
hath
a
particular
pleasure
in
make
me
so
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
the
impertinence
of
virtue
be
,
and
I
can
submit
to
it
;
but
to
be
treat
thus
by
a
whore
 
<EOS>
You
must
forgive
me
,
dear
Booth
,
but
your
success
be
a
kind
of
triumph
over
me
,
which
I
could
not
bear
.
<EOS>
I
own
,
I
have
not
the
least
reason
to
conceive
any
anger
against
you
;
and
yet
,
curse
me
if
I
should
not
have
be
less
displeased
at
your
lying
with
my
own
wife
;
nay
,
I
could
almost
have
part
with
half
my
fortune
to
you
more
willingly
than
have
suffer
you
to
receive
that
trifle
of
my
money
which
you
receive
at
her
hand
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
ask
your
pardon
,
and
I
promise
you
I
will
never
more
think
of
you
with
the
least
ill
-
will
on
the
account
of
this
woman
;
but
as
for
her
,
d####n
me
if
I
do
not
enjoy
her
by
some
mean
or
other
,
<EOS>
whatever
it
cost
me
;
for
I
be
already
above
two
hundred
pound
out
of
pocket
,
without
have
scarce
have
a
smile
in
return
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
exprest
much
astonishment
at
this
declaration
<EOS>
;
he
say
he
could
not
conceive
how
it
be
possible
to
have
such
an
affection
for
a
woman
who
do
not
shew
the
least
inclination
to
return
it
.
<EOS>
James
give
her
a
hearty
curse
,
and
say
,
"
Pox
of
her
inclination
;
I
want
only
the
possession
of
her
person
,
and
that
,
you
will
allow
,
be
a
very
fine
one
.
<EOS>
but
,
besides
my
passion
for
her
,
she
hath
now
pique
my
pride
;
for
how
can
a
man
of
my
fortune
brook
be
refuse
by
a
whore
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
since
you
be
so
set
on
the
business
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
you
will
excuse
my
saying
<EOS>
so
,
I
fancy
<EOS>
you
have
well
change
your
method
of
apply
to
her
;
<EOS>
for
,
as
she
be
,
perhaps
,
the
vain
woman
upon
earth
,
your
bounty
may
probably
do
you
little
service
,
nay
,
may
rather
actually
disoblige
her
.
<EOS>
vanity
be
plainly
her
predominant
passion
,
and
,
if
you
will
administer
to
that
,
it
will
infallibly
throw
her
into
your
arm
.
<EOS>
to
this
I
attribute
my
own
unfortunate
success
.
<EOS>
while
she
relieve
my
want
and
distress
she
be
daily
feed
her
own
vanity
;
whereas
,
as
every
gift
of
yours
assert
your
superiority
,
it
rather
offend
than
please
her
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
woman
generally
love
to
be
of
the
obliging
side
;
and
,
if
we
examine
their
favourite
,
we
shall
find
them
to
be
much
oftener
such
as
they
have
confer
obligation
on
than
such
as
they
have
receive
them
from
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
this
speech
which
please
the
colonel
;
and
he
say
,
with
a
smile
,
"
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
Will
,
but
you
know
woman
better
than
I.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
colonel
,
"
answer
Booth
,
"
I
have
study
their
mind
more
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
however
,
much
envy
your
knowledge
,
"
reply
the
other
,
"
for
I
never
think
their
mind
worth
consider
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
hope
I
shall
profit
a
little
by
your
experience
with
Miss
Matthews
.
<EOS>
Damnation
seize
the
proud
insolent
harlot
!
<EOS>
the
devil
take
me
if
I
do
not
love
her
more
than
I
ever
love
a
woman
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
rest
of
their
conversation
turn
on
Booth
's
affair
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
again
reassume
the
part
of
a
friend
,
give
him
the
remainder
of
the
money
,
and
promise
to
take
the
first
opportunity
of
lay
his
memorial
before
a
great
man
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
greatly
overjoyed
at
this
success
.
<EOS>
nothing
now
lie
on
his
mind
but
to
conceal
his
frailty
from
Amelia
,
to
whom
he
be
afraid
Miss
Matthews
,
in
the
rage
of
her
resentment
,
would
communicate
it
.
<EOS>
this
apprehension
make
him
stay
almost
constantly
at
home
;
and
he
tremble
at
every
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
His
fear
,
moreover
,
betray
him
into
a
meanness
which
he
would
have
heartily
despise
on
any
other
occasion
.
<EOS>
this
be
to
order
the
maid
to
deliver
him
any
letter
direct
to
Amelia
;
at
the
same
time
strictly
charge
her
not
to
acquaint
her
mistress
with
her
have
receive
any
such
order
.
  
<EOS>
a
servant
of
any
acuteness
would
have
form
strange
conjecture
from
such
an
injunction
;
but
this
poor
girl
be
of
perfect
simplicity
;
so
great
,
indeed
,
be
her
simplicity
,
that
,
have
not
Amelia
be
void
of
all
suspicion
of
her
husband
<EOS>
,
the
maid
would
have
soon
after
betray
her
master
.
  
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
while
they
be
drink
tea
,
little
Betty
,
so
be
the
maid
call
,
come
into
the
room
,
and
,
call
her
master
forth
,
deliver
him
a
card
which
be
direct
to
Amelia
.
<EOS>
Booth
,
have
read
the
card
,
on
his
return
into
the
room
chid
the
girl
for
call
him
,
say
"
if
you
can
read
,
child
,
you
must
see
it
be
direct
to
your
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
to
this
the
girl
answer
,
pertly
enough
,
"
I
be
sure
,
sir
,
you
order
me
to
bring
every
letter
first
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
this
hint
,
with
many
woman
,
would
have
be
sufficient
to
have
blow
up
the
whole
affair
;
but
Amelia
,
who
hear
what
the
girl
say
,
through
the
medium
of
love
and
confidence
,
see
the
matter
in
a
much
well
light
than
it
deserve
,
and
,
look
tenderly
on
her
husband
,
say
,
"
indeed
,
my
love
,
I
must
blame
you
for
a
conduct
which
,
perhaps
,
I
ought
rather
to
praise
,
as
it
proceed
only
from
the
extreme
tenderness
of
your
affection
.
<EOS>
but
why
will
you
endeavour
to
keep
any
secret
from
me
?
<EOS>
believe
me
,
for
my
own
sake
,
you
ought
not
;
for
,
as
you
can
not
hide
the
consequence
,
you
make
me
always
suspect
ten
time
bad
than
the
reality
.
<EOS>
while
I
have
you
and
my
child
well
before
my
eye
,
I
be
capable
of
face
any
news
which
can
arrive
;
for
what
ill
news
can
come
(
unless
,
indeed
,
it
concern
my
little
babe
in
the
country
)
which
doth
not
relate
to
the
badness
of
our
circumstance
?
<EOS>
and
those
,
I
thank
Heaven
,
we
have
now
a
fair
prospect
of
retrieve
.
<EOS>
besides
,
dear
Billy
,
though
my
understanding
be
much
inferior
to
yours
,
I
have
sometimes
have
the
happiness
of
luckily
hit
on
some
argument
which
hath
afford
you
comfort
.
<EOS>
this
,
you
know
,
my
dear
,
be
the
case
with
regard
to
Colonel
James
,
whom
I
persuade
you
to
think
you
have
mistake
,
and
you
see
the
event
prove
me
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
happily
,
both
for
herself
and
Mr.
Booth
,
do
the
excellence
of
this
good
woman
's
disposition
deceive
her
,
and
force
her
to
see
everything
in
the
most
advantageous
light
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
the
card
,
be
now
inspect
,
be
find
to
contain
the
compliment
of
Mrs.
James
to
Mrs.
Booth
,
with
an
account
of
her
be
arrive
in
town
,
and
have
bring
with
her
a
very
great
cold
.
<EOS>
Amelia
be
overjoy
at
the
news
of
her
arrival
,
and
have
dr
herself
in
the
utmost
hurry
,
leave
her
child
to
the
care
of
her
husband
,
and
run
away
to
pay
her
respect
to
her
friend
,
whom
she
love
with
a
most
sincere
affection
.
<EOS>
but
how
be
she
disappoint
when
,
eager
with
the
utmost
impatience
,
and
exult
with
the
thought
of
presently
see
her
beloved
friend
,
she
be
answer
at
the
door
that
the
lady
be
not
at
home
!
<EOS>
nor
could
she
,
upon
tell
her
name
,
obtain
any
admission
.
<EOS>
this
,
consider
the
account
she
have
receive
of
the
lady
's
cold
,
greatly
surprize
her
;
and
she
return
home
very
much
vexed
at
her
disappointment
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
who
have
no
suspicion
that
Mrs.
James
be
really
at
home
,
and
,
as
the
phrase
be
,
be
deny
,
would
have
make
a
second
visit
the
next
morning
,
have
she
not
be
prevent
by
a
cold
which
she
herself
now
get
,
and
which
be
attend
with
a
slight
fever
.
<EOS>
this
confine
her
several
day
to
her
house
,
during
which
Booth
officiate
as
her
nurse
,
and
never
stir
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
in
all
this
time
she
hear
not
a
word
from
Mrs.
James
,
which
give
her
some
uneasiness
,
but
more
astonishment
.
<EOS>
the
tenth
day
,
when
she
be
perfectly
recover
,
about
nine
in
the
evening
,
when
she
and
her
husband
be
just
go
to
supper
,
she
hear
a
most
violent
thundering
at
the
door
,
and
presently
after
a
rustling
of
silk
upon
her
staircase
;
at
the
same
time
a
female
voice
cry
out
pretty
loud
,
"
bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
,
be
I
to
climb
up
another
pair
of
stair
?
"
<EOS>
upon
which
Amelia
,
who
well
know
the
voice
,
presently
run
to
the
door
,
and
usher
in
Mrs.
James
,
most
splendidly
dr
,
who
put
on
as
formal
a
countenance
,
and
make
as
formal
a
courtesie
to
her
old
friend
,
as
if
she
have
be
her
very
distant
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Amelia
,
who
be
go
to
rush
into
her
friend
's
arm
,
be
strike
motionless
by
this
behaviour
;
but
re
-
collect
her
spirit
,
as
she
have
an
excellent
presence
of
mind
,
she
presently
understand
what
the
lady
mean
,
and
resolve
to
treat
her
in
her
own
way
.
<EOS>
down
therefore
the
company
sit
,
and
silence
prevail
for
some
time
,
during
which
Mrs.
James
survey
the
room
with
more
attention
than
she
would
have
bestow
on
one
much
fine
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
conversation
begin
,
in
which
the
weather
and
the
diversion
of
the
town
be
well
canvass
.
<EOS>
Amelia
,
who
be
a
woman
of
great
humour
,
perform
her
part
to
admiration
;
so
that
a
by
-
stander
would
have
doubt
,
in
every
other
article
than
dress
,
which
of
the
two
be
the
most
accomplished
fine
lady
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
visit
of
twenty
minute
,
during
which
not
a
word
of
any
former
occurrence
be
mention
,
nor
indeed
any
subject
of
discourse
start
,
except
only
those
two
above
mention
,
Mrs.
James
rise
from
her
chair
and
retire
in
the
same
formal
manner
in
which
she
have
approach
.
<EOS>
We
will
pursue
her
for
the
sake
of
the
contrast
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
She
go
from
Amelia
directly
to
a
rout
,
where
she
spend
two
hour
in
a
croud
of
company
,
talk
again
and
again
over
the
diversion
and
news
of
the
town
,
play
two
rubber
at
whist
,
and
then
retire
to
her
own
apartment
,
where
,
have
past
another
hour
in
undress
herself
,
she
go
to
her
own
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
and
his
wife
,
the
moment
their
companion
be
go
,
sit
down
to
supper
on
a
piece
of
cold
meat
,
the
remain
of
their
dinner
.
<EOS>
after
which
,
over
a
pint
of
wine
,
they
entertain
themselves
for
a
while
with
the
ridiculous
behaviour
of
their
visitant
.
<EOS>
but
Amelia
,
declare
she
rather
see
her
as
the
object
of
pity
than
anger
,
turn
the
discourse
to
pleasanter
topic
.
<EOS>
the
little
action
of
their
child
,
the
former
scene
and
future
prospect
of
their
life
,
furnish
them
with
many
pleasant
idea
;
and
the
contemplation
of
Amelia
's
recovery
throw
Booth
into
rapture
.
<EOS>
at
length
they
retire
,
happy
in
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
possible
some
reader
may
be
no
less
surprized
at
the
behaviour
of
Mrs.
James
than
be
Amelia
herself
,
since
they
may
have
perhaps
receive
so
favourable
an
impression
of
that
lady
from
the
account
give
of
her
by
Mr.
Booth
,
that
her
present
demeanour
may
seem
unnatural
and
inconsistent
with
her
former
character
.
<EOS>
but
they
will
be
pleased
to
consider
the
great
alteration
in
her
circumstance
,
from
a
state
of
dependency
on
a
brother
,
who
be
himself
no
well
than
a
soldier
of
fortune
,
to
that
of
be
wife
to
a
man
of
a
very
large
estate
and
considerable
rank
in
life
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
her
present
behaviour
more
than
that
of
a
fine
lady
who
consider
form
and
show
as
essential
ingredient
of
human
happiness
,
and
imagine
all
friendship
to
consist
in
ceremony
,
courtesy
,
message
,
and
visit
?
<EOS>
in
which
opinion
,
she
hath
the
honour
to
think
with
much
the
large
part
of
one
sex
,
and
no
small
number
of
the
other
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
very
extraordinary
and
pleasant
incident
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
evening
Booth
and
Amelia
go
to
walk
in
the
park
with
their
child
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
on
the
verge
of
the
parade
,
and
Booth
be
describe
to
his
wife
the
several
building
round
it
,
when
,
on
a
sudden
,
Amelia
,
miss
her
little
boy
,
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
where
be
little
Billy
?
"
upon
which
,
Booth
,
cast
his
eye
over
the
grass
,
see
a
foot
-
soldier
shake
the
boy
at
a
little
distance
.
<EOS>
at
this
sight
,
without
make
any
answer
to
his
wife
,
he
leap
over
the
rail
,
and
,
run
directly
up
to
the
fellow
,
who
have
a
firelock
with
a
bayonet
fix
in
his
hand
,
he
seize
him
by
the
collar
and
tript
up
his
heel
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
wrest
his
arm
from
him
.
<EOS>
a
serjeant
upon
duty
,
see
the
affray
at
some
distance
,
run
presently
up
,
and
,
be
tell
what
have
happen
,
give
the
centinel
a
hearty
curse
,
and
tell
him
he
deserve
to
be
hang
.
<EOS>
a
by
-
stander
give
this
information
;
for
Booth
be
return
with
his
little
boy
to
meet
Amelia
,
who
stagger
towards
him
as
fast
as
she
could
,
all
pale
and
breathless
,
and
scarce
able
to
support
her
totter
limb
.
<EOS>
the
serjeant
now
come
up
to
Booth
,
to
make
an
apology
for
the
behaviour
of
the
soldier
,
when
,
of
a
sudden
,
he
turn
almost
as
pale
as
Amelia
herself
.
<EOS>
He
stand
silent
whilst
<EOS>
Booth
be
employ
in
comfort
and
recover
his
wife
;
and
then
,
address
himself
to
him
,
say
,
"
bless
me
!
<EOS>
lieutenant
,
could
I
imagine
it
have
be
your
honour
;
and
be
it
my
little
master
that
the
rascal
use
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
I
do
not
know
it
,
for
I
should
certainly
have
run
my
halbert
into
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
presently
recognise
his
old
faithful
servant
Atkinson
,
and
give
him
a
hearty
greeting
,
say
he
be
very
glad
to
see
him
in
his
present
situation
.
<EOS>
"
whatever
I
be
,
"
answer
the
serjeant
,
"
I
shall
always
think
I
owe
it
to
your
honour
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
take
the
little
boy
by
the
hand
he
cry
,
"
what
a
vast
fine
young
gentleman
master
be
grow
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
curse
the
soldier
's
inhumanity
,
swear
heartily
he
would
make
him
pay
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
Amelia
be
much
disorder
with
her
fright
,
she
do
not
recollect
her
foster
-
brother
till
he
be
introduce
to
her
by
Booth
;
but
she
no
sooner
know
him
than
she
bestow
a
most
obliging
smile
on
him
;
and
,
call
him
by
the
name
of
honest
Joe
,
say
she
be
heartily
glad
to
see
him
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
see
,
my
dear
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
what
preferment
your
old
friend
be
come
to
.
<EOS>
You
would
scarce
know
him
,
I
believe
,
in
his
present
state
of
finery
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
well
pleased
to
see
it
,
"
answer
Amelia
,
"
and
I
wish
him
joy
of
be
make
an
officer
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
fact
,
from
what
Mr.
Booth
say
,
join
to
the
serjeant
's
laced
coat
,
she
believe
that
he
have
obtain
a
commission
.
<EOS>
so
weak
and
absurd
be
human
vanity
,
that
this
mistake
of
Amelia
's
possibly
put
poor
Atkinson
out
of
countenance
,
for
he
look
at
this
instant
more
silly
than
he
have
ever
do
in
his
life
;
and
,
make
her
a
most
respectful
bow
,
mutter
something
about
obligation
,
in
a
scarce
articulate
or
intelligible
manner
.
  
<EOS>
the
serjeant
have
,
indeed
,
among
many
other
quality
,
that
modesty
which
a
latin
author
honour
by
the
name
of
ingenuous
:
nature
have
give
him
this
,
notwithstanding
the
meanness
of
his
birth
;
and
six
year
'
conversation
in
the
army
have
not
take
it
away
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
he
be
a
noble
fellow
;
and
<EOS>
Amelia
,
by
suppose
he
have
a
commission
in
the
guard
,
have
be
guilty
of
no
affront
to
that
honourable
body
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
have
a
real
affection
for
Atkinson
,
though
,
in
fact
,
he
know
not
half
his
merit
.
<EOS>
He
acquaint
him
with
his
lodging
,
where
he
earnestly
desire
to
see
him
.

<EOS>
Amelia

from
the
terror
into
which
the
see
her
husband

with
the
soldier
have
throw
her

desire
to
go
home

nor
be
she
well
able

<EOS>
while

therefore
,
on
her

she
tell
Atkinson
she
should
be
oblige
to
him
if
he
would
take
care
of

He
readily
accept
the
office
;
but
,
upon
offer
his
hand
to
miss

she
refuse
,
and
burst
into
tear
.
<EOS>
upon
which
the
tender
mother
resign
Booth
to
her
child

and
put
herself
under
the
serjeant
's
protection
;
who
conduct
her
safe
home
,
though
she
often
declare
she
fear
she
should
drop
down
by
the
way

affect
the
serjeant

for
,
besides
the
honour
which
he
himself
have
for
the
lady
,
he
know
how
tenderly
his
friend
love
her

<EOS>
that
he
be
unable
to

have
not
his
nerve
be
so
strongly
braced
that
nothing
could
shake
them
<EOS>
,
he
have
enough
in
his
mind
to
have
set
him
a
tremble
equally
with
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
at
the
lodging
the
mistress
of
the
house
open
the
door
,
who
,
see
Amelia
's
condition
,
throw
open
the
parlour
and
beg
her
to
walk
in
,
upon
which
she
immediately
fling
herself
into
a
chair
,
and
all
present
thought
she
would
have
faint
away
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
escape
that
misery
,
and
,
have
drink
a
glass
of
water
with
a
little
white
wine
mixed
in
it
,
she
begin
in
a
little
time
to
regain
her
complexion
,
and
at
length
assure
Booth
that
she
be
perfectly
recover
,
but
declare
she
have
never
undergo
so
much
,
and
earnestly
beg
him
never
to
be
so
rash
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
She
then
call
her
little
boy
and
gently
chid
him
,
say
,
"
You
must
never
do
so
more
,
Billy
<EOS>
;
you
see
what
mischief
you
may
have
bring
upon
your
father
,
and
what
you
have
make
me
suffer

"
<EOS>
"
La
!
mamma
,
"
say
the
child
,
"
what
harm
do
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
people
may
not
walk
in
the
green
field
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
if
I
do
a
fault
,
the
man
punish
me
enough
for
it
,
for
he
pinch
me
almost
through
my
slender
arm

"
<EOS>
He
then
bare
his
little
arm
,
which
be
greatly
discolour
by
the
injury
it
have
receive
.
<EOS>
Booth
utter
a
most
dreadful
execration
at
this
sight
,
and
the
serjeant
,
who
be
now
present
,
do
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
Atkinson
now
return
to
his
guard
and
go
directly
to
the
officer
to
acquaint
him
with
the
soldier
's
inhumanity
,
but
he
,
who
be
about
fifteen
year
of
age
,
give
the
serjeant
a
great
curse
and
say
the
soldier
have
do
very
well
,
for
that
idle
boy
ought
to
be
correct
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
do
not
satisfy
poor
Atkinson
,
who
,
the
next
day
,
as
soon
as
the
guard
be
relieve
,
beat
the
fellow
most
unmercifully
,
and
tell
him
he
would
remember
him
as
long
as
he
stay
in
the
regiment
.
  
<EOS>
thus
end
this
trifling
adventure
,
which
some
reader
will
,
perhaps
,
be
pleased
at
see
relate
at
full
length
.
<EOS>
none
,
I
think
,
can
fail
draw
one
observation
from
it
,
namely
,
how
capable
the
most
insignificant
accident
be
of
disturb
human
happiness
,
and
of
produce
the
most
unexpected
and
dreadful
event
.
<EOS>
a
reflexion
which
may
serve
to
many
moral
and
religious
use
.
  
<EOS>
this
accident
produce
the
first
acquaintance
between
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
her
lodger
;
for
hitherto
they
have
scarce
exchange
a
word
together
.
<EOS>
but
the
great
concern
which
the
good
woman
have
shew
on
Amelia
's
account
at
this
time
,
be
not
likely
to
pass
unobserved
or
unthanke
either
by
the
husband
or
wife
.
<EOS>
Amelia
,
therefore
,
as
soon
as
she
be
able
to
go
up
-
stair
,
invite
Mrs.
Ellison
(
for
that
be
her
name
)
to
her
apartment
,
and
desire
the
favour
of
her
to
stay
to
supper
.
<EOS>
She
readily
comply
,
and
they
past
a
very
agreeable
evening
together
,
in
which
the
two
woman
seem
to
have
conceive
a
most
extraordinary
like
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
though
beauty
in
general
doth
not
greatly
recommend
one
woman
to
another
,
as
it
be
too
apt
to
create
envy
,
yet
,
in
case
where
this
passion
doth
not
interfere
,
a
fine
woman
be
often
a
pleasing
object
even
to
some
of
her
own
sex
,
especially
when
her
beauty
be
attend
with
a
certain
air
of
affability
,
as
be
that
of
Amelia
in
the
high
degree
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
indeed
,
a
most
charming
woman
;
and
I
know
not
whether
the
little
scar
on
her
nose
do
not
rather
add
to
than
diminish
her
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
,
therefore
,
be
as
much
charm
with
the
loveliness
of
her
fair
lodger
as
with
all
her
other
engaging
quality
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
indeed
,
so
take
with
Amelia
's
beauty
,
that
she
could
not
refrain
from
cry
out
in
a
kind
of
transport
of
admiration
,
"
upon
my
word
,
Captain
Booth
,
you
be
the
happy
man
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
Your
lady
be
so
extremely
handsome
that
one
can
not
look
at
her
without
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
good
woman
have
herself
none
of
these
attractive
charm
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
Her
person
be
short
and
immoderately
fat
;
her
feature
be
none
of
the
most
regular
;
and
her
complexion
(
if
indeed
she
ever
have
a
good
one
)
have
considerably
suffer
by
time
.
  
<EOS>
Her
good
humour
and
complaisance
,
however
,
be
highly
pleasing
to
Amelia
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
why
should
we
conceal
the
secret
satisfaction
which
that
lady
feel
from
the
compliment
pay
to
her
person
?
<EOS>
since
such
of
my
reader
as
like
her
good
will
not
be
sorry
to
find
that
she
be
a
woman
.
    
<EOS>
contain
various
matter
.
 
<EOS>
a
fortnight
have
now
pass
since
Booth
have
see
or
hear
from
the
colonel
,
<EOS>
which
do
not
a
little
surprize
him
,
as
they
have
part
so
good
friend
,
and
as
he
have
so
cordially
undertake
his
cause
concern
the
memorial
on
which
all
his
hope
depend
.
  
<EOS>
the
uneasiness
which
this
give
him
farther
encrease
on
find
that
his
friend
refuse
to
see
him
;
for
he
have
pay
the
colonel
a
visit
at
nine
in
the
morning
,
and
be
tell
he
be
not
stirring
;
and
<EOS>
at
his
return
back
an
hour
afterwards
the
servant
say
his
master
be
go
out
,
of
which
Booth
be
certain
of
the
falsehood
;
for
he
have
,
during
that
whole
hour
,
walk
backwards
and
forwards
within
sight
of
the
colonel
's
door
,
and
must
have
see
him
if
he
have
go
out
within
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
colonel
,
however
,
do
not
long
suffer
his
friend
to
continue
in
the
deplorable
state
of
anxiety
;
for
,
the
very
next
morning
,
Booth
receive
his
memorial
enclose
in
a
letter
,
acquaint
him
that
Mr.
James
have
mention
his
affair
to
the
person
he
propose
,
but
that
the
great
man
have
so
many
engagement
on
his
hand
that
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
make
any
further
promise
at
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
cold
and
distant
stile
of
this
letter
,
and
,
indeed
,
the
whole
behaviour
of
James
,
so
different
from
what
it
have
be
formerly
,
have
something
so
mysterious
in
it
,
that
it
greatly
puzzle
and
perplex
poor
Booth
;
and
it
be
so
long
before
he
be
able
to
solve
it
,
that
the
reader
's
curiosity
will
,
perhaps
,
be
oblige
to
us
for
not
leave
him
so
long
in
the
dark
as
to
this
matter
.
<EOS>
the
true
reason
,
then
,
of
the
colonel
's
conduct
be
this
:
his
unbounded
generosity
,
together
with
the
unbounded
extravagance
and
consequently
the
great
necessity
of
Miss
Matthews
,
have
at
length
overcome
the
cruelty
of
that
lady
,
with
whom
he
likewise
have
luckily
no
rival
.
<EOS>
above
all
,
the
desire
of
be
revenge
on
Booth
,
with
whom
she
be
to
the
high
degree
enrage
,
have
,
perhaps
,
contribute
not
a
little
to
his
success
;
for
she
have
no
sooner
condescend
to
a
familiarity
with
her
new
lover
,
and
discover
that
Captain
James
,
of
whom
she
have
hear
so
much
from
Booth
,
be
no
other
than
the
identical
colonel
,
than
she
employ
every
art
of
which
she
be
mistress
to
make
an
utter
breach
of
friendship
between
these
two
.
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
she
do
not
scruple
to
insinuate
that
the
colonel
be
not
at
all
oblige
to
the
character
give
of
him
by
his
friend
,
and
to
the
account
of
this
latter
she
place
most
of
the
cruelty
which
she
have
shew
to
the
former
.
  
<EOS>
have
the
colonel
make
a
proper
use
of
his
reason
,
and
fairly
examine
the
probability
of
the
fact
,
he
could
scarce
have
be
impose
upon
to
believe
a
matter
so
inconsistent
with
all
he
know
of
Booth
,
and
in
which
that
gentleman
must
have
sin
against
all
the
law
of
honour
without
any
visible
temptation
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
solemn
fact
,
the
colonel
be
so
intoxicated
with
his
love
,
that
it
be
in
the
power
of
his
mistress
to
have
persuade
him
of
anything
;
besides
,
he
have
an
interest
in
give
her
credit
,
for
he
be
not
a
little
pleased
with
find
a
reason
for
hate
the
man
whom
he
could
not
help
hate
without
any
reason
,
at
least
,
without
any
which
he
durst
fairly
assign
even
to
himself
.
<EOS>
henceforth
,
therefore
,
he
abandon
all
friendship
for
Booth
,
and
be
more
inclined
to
put
him
out
of
the
world
than
to
endeavour
any
longer
at
support
him
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
communicate
this
letter
to
his
wife
,
who
endeavour
,
as
usual
,
to
the
utmost
of
her
power
,
to
console
him
under
one
of
the
great
affliction
which
,
I
think
,
can
befal
a
man
,
namely
,
the
unkindness
of
a
friend
;
but
he
have
luckily
at
the
same
time
the
great
blessing
in
his
possession
,
the
kindness
of
a
faithful
and
beloved
wife
.
<EOS>
a
blessing
,
however
,
which
,
though
it
compensate
most
of
the
evil
of
life
,
rather
serve
to
aggravate
the
misfortune
of
distressed
circumstance
,
from
the
consideration
of
the
share
which
she
be
to
bear
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
this
afternoon
Amelia
receive
a
second
visit
from
Mrs.
Ellison
,
who
acquaint
her
that
she
have
a
present
of
a
ticket
for
the
oratorio
,
which
would
carry
two
person
into
the
gallery
;
and
therefore
beg
the
favour
of
her
company
thither
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
with
many
thank
,
acknowledge
the
civility
of
Mrs.
Ellison
,
but
decline
accept
her
offer
;
upon
which
Booth
very
strenuously
insist
on
her
go
,
and
say
to
her
,
"
My
dear
,
if
you
know
the
satisfaction
I
have
in
any
of
your
pleasure
,
I
be
convince
you
would
not
refuse
the
favour
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
be
so
kind
to
offer
you
;
for
,
as
you
be
a
lover
of
music
,
you
,
who
have
never
be
at
an
oratorio
,
can
not
conceive
how
you
will
be
delighted
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
well
know
your
goodness
,
my
dear
,
"
answer
Amelia
,
"
but
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
of
leave
my
child
without
some
person
more
proper
to
take
care
of
them
than
this
poor
girl
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
remove
this
objection
by
offer
her
own
servant
,
a
very
discreet
matron
,
to
attend
them
;
but
notwithstanding
this
,
and
all
she
could
say
,
with
the
assistance
of
Booth
,
and
of
the
child
themselves
,
Amelia
still
persist
in
her
refusal
;
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
who
know
how
far
good
breeding
allow
person
to
be
press
on
these
occasion
,
take
her
leave
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
no
sooner
depart
than
Amelia
,
look
tenderly
on
her
husband
,
say
,
"
how
can
you
,
my
dear
creature
,
think
that
music
hath
any
charm
for
me
at
this
time
?
<EOS>
or
,
indeed
,
do
you
believe
that
I
be
capable
of
any
sensation
worthy
the
name
of
pleasure
when
neither
you
nor
my
child
be
present
or
bear
any
part
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
an
officer
of
the
regiment
to
which
Booth
have
formerly
belong
,
hear
from
Atkinson
where
he
lodge
,
now
come
to
pay
him
a
visit
.
<EOS>
He
tell
him
that
several
of
their
old
acquaintance
be
to
meet
the
next
Wednesday
at
a
tavern
,
and
very
strongly
press
him
to
be
one
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
Booth
be
,
in
truth
,
what
be
call
a
hearty
fellow
,
and
love
now
and
then
to
take
a
chearful
glass
with
his
friend
;
but
he
excuse
himself
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
His
friend
declare
he
would
take
no
denial
,
and
he
grow
very
importunate
,
Amelia
at
length
second
him
.
<EOS>
upon
this
Booth
answer
,
"
well
,
my
dear
,
since
you
desire
me
,
I
will
comply
,
but
on
one
condition
,
that
you
go
at
the
same
time
to
the
oratorio
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Amelia
think
this
request
reasonable
enough
,
and
give
her
consent
;
of
which
Mrs.
Ellison
presently
receive
the
news
,
and
with
great
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
be
ask
why
Booth
could
go
to
the
tavern
,
and
not
to
the
oratorio
with
his
wife
?
<EOS>
in
truth
,
then
,
the
tavern
be
within
hallowed
ground
,
that
be
to
say
,
in
the
verge
of
the
court
;
for
,
of
five
officer
that
be
to
meet
there
,
three
,
besides
Booth
,
be
confine
to
that
air
which
hath
be
always
find
extremely
wholesome
to
a
break
military
constitution
.
<EOS>
and
here
,
if
the
good
reader
will
pardon
the
pun
,
he
will
scarce
be
offend
at
the
observation
;
since
,
how
be
it
possible
that
,
without
run
in
debt
,
any
person
should
maintain
the
dress
and
appearance
of
a
gentleman
whose
income
be
not
half
so
good
as
that
of
a
porter
?
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
this
allowance
,
small
as
it
be
,
be
a
great
expense
to
the
public
;
but
,
if
several
more
unnecessary
charge
be
spare
,
the
public
may
,
perhaps
,
bear
a
little
encrease
of
this
without
much
feeling
it
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
,
I
be
sure
,
have
equal
reason
to
complain
at
contribute
to
the
maintenance
of
a
sett
of
brave
fellow
,
who
,
at
the
hazard
of
their
health
,
their
limb
,
and
their
life
,
have
maintain
the
safety
and
honour
of
their
country
,
as
when
they
find
themselves
tax
to
the
support
of
a
sett
of
drone
,
who
have
not
the
least
merit
or
claim
to
their
favour
,
and
who
,
without
contribute
in
any
manner
to
the
good
of
the
hive
,
live
luxuriously
on
the
labour
of
the
industrious
bee
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Amelia
,
with
her
friend
,
go
to
the
oratorio
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
happen
between
the
Monday
and
the
Wednesday
worthy
a
place
in
this
history
.
<EOS>
upon
the
evening
of
the
latter
the
two
lady
go
to
the
oratorio
,
and
be
there
time
enough
to
get
a
first
row
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
be
only
one
person
in
the
house
when
they
come
;
for
Amelia
's
inclination
,
when
she
give
a
loose
to
them
,
be
pretty
eager
for
this
diversion
,
she
be
a
great
lover
of
music
,
and
particularly
of
Mr.
Handel
's
composition
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
be
,
I
suppose
,
a
great
lover
likewise
of
music
,
for
she
be
the
more
impatient
of
the
two
;
which
be
rather
the
more
extraordinary
;
as
these
entertainment
be
not
such
novelty
to
her
as
they
be
to
poor
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
though
our
lady
arrive
full
two
hour
before
they
see
the
back
of
Mr.
Handel
,
yet
this
time
of
expectation
do
not
hang
extremely
heavy
on
their
hand
;
for
,
besides
their
own
chat
,
they
have
the
company
of
the
gentleman
whom
they
find
at
their
first
arrival
in
the
gallery
,
and
who
,
though
plainly
,
or
rather
roughly
dressed
,
very
luckily
for
the
woman
,
happen
to
be
not
only
well
-
breed
,
but
a
person
of
very
lively
conversation
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
on
his
part
,
seem
highly
charm
with
Amelia
,
and
in
fact
be
so
,
for
,
though
he
restrain
himself
entirely
within
the
rule
of
good
breeding
,
yet
be
he
in
the
high
degree
officious
to
catch
at
every
opportunity
of
shew
his
respect
,
and
do
her
little
service
.
<EOS>
He
procure
her
a
book
and
wax
-
candle
,
and
hold
the
candle
for
her
himself
during
the
whole
entertainment
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
oratorio
he
declare
he
would
not
leave
the
lady
till
he
have
see
them
safe
into
their
chair
or
coach
;
and
at
the
same
time
very
earnestly
entreat
that
he
may
have
the
honour
of
wait
on
them
.
<EOS>
upon
which
Mrs.
Ellison
,
who
be
a
very
good
-
humoured
woman
,
answer
,
"
ay
,
sure
,
sir
,
if
you
please
;
you
have
be
very
obliging
to
us
;
and
a
dish
of
tea
shall
be
at
your
service
at
any
time
;
"
and
then
tell
him
where
she
live
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
be
no
sooner
seat
in
their
hackney
coach
than
Mrs.
Ellison
burst
into
a
loud
laughter
,
and
cry
,
"
I
will
be
hang
,
madam
,
if
you
have
not
make
a
conquest
to
-
night
;
and
what
be
very
pleasant
<EOS>
,
I
believe
the
poor
gentleman
take
you
for
a
single
lady
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
answer
Amelia
very
gravely
,
"
I
protest
I
begin
to
think
at
last
<EOS>
he
be
rather
too
particular
,
though
he
do
not
venture
at
a
word
that
I
could
be
offend
at
;
but
,
if
you
fancy
any
such
thing
,
I
be
sorry
you
invite
him
to
drink
tea
,
"
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
"
reply
Mrs.
Ellison
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
angry
with
a
man
for
like
you
?
<EOS>
if
you
be
,
you
will
be
angry
with
almost
every
man
that
see
you
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
a
man
myself
,
I
declare
I
should
be
in
the
number
of
your
admirer
.
<EOS>
poor
gentleman
,
I
pity
him
heartily
;
he
little
know
that
you
have
not
a
heart
to
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
should
not
be
surprize
at
see
a
serious
proposal
of
marriage
:
for
I
be
convinced
he
be
a
man
of
fortune
,
not
only
by
the
politeness
of
his
address
,
but
by
the
fineness
of
his
linen
,
and
that
valuable
diamond
ring
on
his
finger
.
<EOS>
but
you
will
see
more
of
him
when
he
come
to
tea
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
shall
not
,
"
answer
Amelia
,
"
<EOS>
though
I
believe
you
only
rally
me
;
I
hope
you
have
a
well
opinion
of
me
than
to
think
I
would
go
willingly
into
the
company
of
a
man
who
have
an
improper
liking
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
,
who
be
one
of
the
gay
woman
in
the
world
,
repeat
the
word
,
improper
liking
,
with
a
laugh
;
and
cry
,
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Booth
,
believe
me
,
you
be
too
handsome
and
too
good
-
humour
for
a
prude
.
<EOS>
how
can
you
affect
be
offend
at
what
I
be
convinced
<EOS>
be
the
great
pleasure
of
womankind
,
and
chiefly
,
I
believe
,
of
us
virtuous
woman
?
<EOS>
for
,
I
assure
you
,
notwithstanding
my
gaiety
,
I
be
as
virtuous
as
any
prude
in
Europe
.
"
<EOS>
"
far
be
it
from
me
,
madam
,
"
say
Amelia
,
"
to
suspect
the
contrary
of
abundance
of
woman
who
indulge
themselves
in
much
great
freedom
than
I
should
take
,
or
have
any
pleasure
in
take
;
for
I
solemnly
protest
,
if
I
know
my
own
heart
,
the
liking
of
all
man
,
but
of
one
,
be
a
matter
quite
indifferent
to
me
,
or
rather
would
be
highly
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
discourse
bring
them
home
,
where
Amelia
,
find
her
child
asleep
,
and
her
husband
not
return
,
invite
her
companion
to
partake
of
her
homely
fare
,
and
down
they
sit
to
supper
together
.
<EOS>
the
clock
strike
twelve
;
and
,
no
news
be
arrive
of
Booth
,
Mrs.
Ellison
begin
to
express
some
astonishment
at
his
stay
,
whence
she
launch
into
a
general
reflexion
on
husband
,
and
soon
pass
to
some
particular
invective
on
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
my
dear
madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
know
the
present
state
of
your
mind
,
by
what
I
have
myself
often
feel
formerly
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
stranger
to
the
melancholy
tone
of
a
midnight
clock
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
misfortune
to
drag
on
a
heavy
chain
above
fifteen
year
with
a
sottish
yoke
-
fellow
.
<EOS>
but
how
can
I
wonder
at
my
fate
,
since
I
see
even
your
superior
charm
can
not
confine
a
husband
from
the
bewitching
pleasure
of
a
bottle
?
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
"
say
Amelia
,
"
I
have
no
reason
to
complain
;
Mr.
Booth
be
one
of
the
soberest
of
man
;
but
now
and
then
to
spend
a
late
hour
with
his
friend
be
,
I
think
,
highly
excusable
.
"
<EOS>
"
o
,
no
doubt
!
<EOS>
"
cry
Mrs.
Ellison
,
"
if
he
can
excuse
himself
;
but
if
I
be
a
man
"
here
Booth
come
in
and
interrupt
the
discourse
.
<EOS>
Amelia
's
eye
flash
with
joy
the
moment
he
appear
;
and
he
discover
no
less
pleasure
in
see
her
.
<EOS>
His
spirit
be
indeed
a
little
elevated
with
wine
,
so
as
to
heighten
his
good
humour
,
without
in
the
least
disorder
his
understanding
,
and
make
him
such
delightful
company
,
that
,
though
it
be
past
one
in
the
morning
,
neither
his
wife
nor
Mrs.
Ellison
think
of
their
bed
during
a
whole
hour
.
  
<EOS>
early
the
next
morning
the
serjeant
come
to
Mr.
Booth
's
lodging
,
and
with
a
melancholy
countenance
acquaint
him
that
he
have
be
the
night
before
at
an
alehouse
,
where
he
hear
one
Mr.
Murphy
,
an
attorney
,
declare
that
he
would
get
a
warrant
back
against
one
Captain
Booth
at
the
next
board
of
greencloth
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
your
honour
will
pardon
me
,
but
,
by
what
he
say
,
I
be
afraid
he
mean
your
honour
;
and
therefore
I
think
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
;
for
I
know
the
same
thing
happen
to
a
gentleman
here
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
give
Mr.
Atkinson
many
thank
for
his
information
.
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
not
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
I
be
the
person
mean
;
for
it
would
be
foolish
in
me
to
deny
that
I
be
liable
to
apprehension
of
that
sort
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
"
say
the
serjeant
,
"
your
honour
will
soon
have
reason
to
fear
no
man
live
;
but
in
the
mean
time
,
if
any
accident
should
happen
,
my
bail
be
at
your
service
as
far
as
it
will
go
;
and
I
be
a
housekeeper
,
and
can
swear
myself
worth
one
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
which
hearty
and
friendly
declaration
receive
all
those
acknowledgment
from
Booth
which
it
really
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
gentleman
be
greatly
alarm
at
the
news
;
but
he
be
altogether
as
much
surprize
at
Murphy
's
be
the
attorney
employ
against
him
,
as
all
his
debt
,
except
only
to
Captain
James
,
arise
in
the
country
,
where
he
do
not
know
that
Mr.
Murphy
have
any
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
make
no
doubt
that
he
be
the
person
intend
,
and
resolve
to
remain
a
close
prisoner
in
his
own
lodging
,
till
he
see
the
event
of
a
proposal
which
have
be
make
him
the
evening
before
at
the
tavern
,
where
an
honest
gentleman
,
who
have
a
post
under
the
government
,
and
who
be
one
of
the
company
,
have
promise
to
serve
him
with
the
secretary
at
war
,
tell
him
that
he
make
no
doubt
of
procure
him
whole
pay
in
a
regiment
abroad
,
which
in
his
present
circumstance
be
very
highly
worth
his
acceptance
,
when
,
indeed
,
that
and
a
gaol
seem
to
be
the
only
alternative
that
offer
themselves
to
his
choice
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
and
his
lady
spend
that
afternoon
with
Mrs.
Ellison
 
an
incident
which
we
should
scarce
have
mention
,
have
it
not
be
that
Amelia
give
,
on
this
occasion
,
an
instance
of
that
prudence
which
should
never
be
off
its
guard
in
married
woman
of
delicacy
;
for
,
before
she
would
consent
to
drink
tea
with
Mrs.
Ellison
,
she
make
condition
that
the
gentleman
who
have
meet
them
at
the
oratorio
should
not
be
let
in
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
this
circumspection
prove
unnecessary
in
the
present
instance
,
for
no
such
visitor
ever
come
;
a
circumstance
which
give
great
content
to
Amelia
;
for
that
lady
have
be
a
little
uneasy
at
the
raillery
of
Mrs.
Ellison
,
and
have
upon
reflexion
magnify
every
little
compliment
make
her
,
and
every
little
civility
shew
her
by
the
unknown
gentleman
,
far
beyond
the
truth
.
<EOS>
these
imagination
now
all
subside
again
;
and
she
impute
all
that
Mrs.
Ellison
have
say
either
to
raillery
or
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
a
young
lady
make
a
fourth
with
them
at
whist
,
and
likewise
stay
the
whole
evening
.
<EOS>
Her
name
be
Bennet
.
<EOS>
She
be
about
the
age
of
five
-
and-
twenty
;
but
sickness
have
give
her
an
old
look
,
and
have
a
good
deal
diminish
her
beauty
;
of
which
,
young
as
she
be
,
she
plainly
appear
to
have
only
the
remain
in
her
present
possession
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
one
particular
the
very
reverse
of
Mrs.
Ellison
,
be
altogether
as
remarkably
grave
as
the
other
be
gay
.
<EOS>
this
gravity
be
not
,
however
,
attend
with
any
sourness
of
temper
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
have
much
sweetness
in
her
countenance
,
and
be
perfectly
well
breed
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
Amelia
impute
her
grave
deportment
to
her
ill
health
,
and
begin
to
entertain
a
compassion
for
her
,
which
in
good
mind
,
that
be
to
say
,
in
mind
capable
of
compassion
,
be
certain
to
introduce
some
little
degree
of
love
or
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
be
in
short
so
pleased
with
the
conversation
of
this
lady
,
that
,
though
a
woman
of
no
impertinent
curiosity
,
she
could
not
help
take
the
first
opportunity
of
enquire
who
she
be
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
say
that
she
be
an
unhappy
lady
,
who
have
marry
a
young
clergyman
for
love
,
who
,
die
of
a
consumption
,
have
leave
her
a
widow
in
very
indifferent
circumstance
.
<EOS>
this
account
make
Amelia
still
pity
her
more
,
and
consequently
add
to
the
liking
which
she
have
already
conceive
for
her
.
<EOS>
Amelia
,
therefore
,
desire
Mrs.
Ellison
to
bring
her
acquaint
with
Mrs.
Bennet
,
and
say
she
would
go
any
day
with
her
to
make
that
lady
a
visit
.
<EOS>
"
there
need
be
no
ceremony
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Ellison
;
"
she
be
a
woman
of
no
form
;
and
,
as
I
see
plainly
she
be
extremely
pleased
with
Mrs.
Booth
<EOS>
,
I
be
convinced
I
can
bring
her
to
drink
tea
with
you
any
afternoon
you
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
two
next
day
Booth
continue
at
home
,
highly
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
Amelia
,
who
really
know
no
happiness
out
of
his
company
,
nor
scarce
any
misery
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
indeed
,
at
all
time
so
much
of
his
company
,
when
in
his
power
,
that
she
have
no
occasion
to
assign
any
particular
reason
for
his
staying
with
her
,
and
consequently
it
could
give
her
no
cause
of
suspicion
.
<EOS>
the
Saturday
,
one
of
her
child
be
a
little
disorder
with
a
feverish
complaint
which
confine
her
to
her
room
,
and
prevent
her
drink
tea
in
the
afternoon
with
her
husband
in
Mrs.
Ellison
's
apartment
,
where
a
noble
lord
,
a
cousin
of
Mrs.
Ellison
's
,
happen
to
be
present
;
for
,
though
that
lady
be
reduce
in
her
circumstance
and
oblige
to
let
out
part
of
her
house
in
lodging
,
she
be
bear
of
a
good
family
and
have
some
considerable
relation
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
be
not
himself
in
any
office
of
state
,
but
his
fortune
give
him
great
authority
with
those
who
be
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
,
therefore
,
very
bluntly
take
an
opportunity
of
recommend
Booth
to
his
consideration
.
<EOS>
She
take
the
first
hint
from
my
lord
's
call
the
gentleman
captain
;
to
which
she
answer
,
"
ay
,
I
wish
your
lordship
would
make
him
so
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
act
of
justice
,
and
I
know
it
be
in
your
power
to
do
much
great
thing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
mention
Booth
's
service
,
and
the
wound
he
have
receive
at
the
siege
,
of
which
she
have
hear
a
faithful
account
from
Amelia
.
<EOS>
Booth
blush
,
and
be
as
silent
as
a
young
virgin
at
the
hear
her
own
praise
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
answer
,
"
Cousin
Ellison
,
you
know
you
may
command
my
interest
;
nay
,
I
shall
have
a
pleasure
in
serve
one
of
Mr.
Booth
's
character
:
for
my
part
,
I
think
merit
in
all
capacity
ought
to
be
encourage
,
but
I
know
the
ministry
be
greatly
pester
with
solicitation
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
however
,
Mr.
Booth
may
be
assure
I
will
take
the
first
opportunity
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
I
shall
be
glad
of
see
him
any
morning
he
please
.
"
<EOS>
for
all
these
declaration
Booth
be
not
want
in
acknowledgment
to
the
generous
peer
any
more
than
he
be
in
secret
gratitude
to
the
lady
who
have
shew
so
friendly
and
uncommon
a
zeal
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
,
when
he
know
the
character
of
this
nobleman
,
may
,
perhaps
,
conclude
that
his
see
Booth
alone
be
a
lucky
circumstance
,
for
he
be
so
passionate
an
admirer
of
woman
,
that
he
could
scarce
have
escape
the
attraction
of
Amelia
's
beauty
.
<EOS>
and
few
man
,
as
I
have
observe
,
have
such
disintereste
generosity
as
to
serve
a
husband
the
well
because
they
be
in
love
with
his
wife
,
unless
she
will
condescend
to
pay
a
price
beyond
the
reach
of

virtuous

old
acquaintance

<EOS>
Booth
's
affair
be
put
on
a
well
aspect
than
they
have
ever
wear
before
,
and
he
be
willing
to
make
use
of
the
opportunity
of
one
day
in
seven
to
taste
the
fresh
air
.
  
<EOS>
at
nine
in
the
morning
he
go
to
pay
a
visit
to
his
old
friend
Colonel
James
,
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
have
a
full
explanation
of
that
behaviour
which
appear
to
him
so
mysterious
:
<EOS>
but
the
colonel
be
as
inaccessible
as
the
best
defended
fortress
;
and
it
be
as
impossible
for
Booth
to
pass
beyond
his
entry
as
the
Spaniards
find
it
to
take
Gibraltar
.
<EOS>
He
receive
the
usual
answer
;
first
,
that
the
colonel
be
not
stirring
,
and
an
hour
after
that
he
be
go
out
.
<EOS>
all
that
he
get
by
ask
further
question
be
only
to
receive
still
ruder
answer
,
by
which
,
if
he
have
be
very
sagacious
,
he
may
have
be
satisfy
how
little
worth
his
while
it
be
to
desire
to
go
in
;
for
the
porter
at
a
great
man
's
door
be
a
kind
of
thermometer
,
by
which
you
may
discover
the
warmth
or
coldness
of
his
master
's
friendship
.
<EOS>
nay
,
in
the
high
station
of
all
,
as
the
great
man
himself
hath
his
different
kind
of
salutation
,
from
an
hearty
embrace
with
a
kiss
,
and
my
dear
lord
or
dear
Sir
Charles
,
down
to
,
<EOS>
well
Mr.
#
#
#
#
,
 
what
would
you
have
me
do
?
<EOS>
so
the
porter
to
some
bow
with
respect
,
to
other
with
a
smile
,
to
some
he
bow
more
,
to
other
less
low
,
to
other
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
some
he
just
let
in
,
and
other
he
just
shut
out
.
<EOS>
and
in
all
this
they
so
well
correspond
,
that
one
would
be
incline
to
think
that
the
great
man
and
his
porter
have
compare
their
list
together
,
and
,
like
two
actor
concern
to
act
different
part
in
the
same
scene
,
have
rehearse
their
part
privately
together
before
they
venture
to
perform
in
public
.
  
<EOS>
though
Booth
do
not
,
perhaps
,
see
the
whole
matter
in
this
just
light
,
for
that
in
reality
it
be
,
yet
he
be
discern
enough
to
conclude
,
from
the
behaviour
of
the
servant
,
especially
when
he
consider
that
of
the
master
likewise
,
that
he
have
entirely
lose
the
friendship
of
James
;
and
this
conviction
give
him
a
concern
that
not
only
the
flattering
prospect
of
his
lordship
's
favour
be
not
able
to
compensate
,
but
which
even
obliterate
,
and
make
him
for
a
while
forget
the
situation
in
which
he
have
leave
his
Amelia
:
and
he
wander
about
almost
two
hour
,
scarce
knowing
where
he
go
<EOS>
,
till
at
last
he
dropt
into
a
coffee
-
house
near
St
James
's
,
where
he
sit
himself
down
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
scarce
drank
his
dish
of
coffee
before
he
hear
a
young
officer
of
the
guard
cry
to
another
,
"
<EOS>
od
,
d####n
me
,
Jack
<EOS>
,
here

here
be
old
honour
and
dignity
,
faith
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
upon
which
he
see
a
chair
open
,
and
out
issue
a
most
erect
and
stately
figure
indeed
,
with
a
vast
periwig
on
his
head
,
and
a
vast
hat
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
this
august
personage
,
have
enter
the
room
,
walk
directly
up
to
the
upper
end
,
where
have
pay
his
respect
to
all
present
of
any
note
,
to
each
accord
to
seniority
,
he
at
last
cast
his
eye
on
Booth
,
and
very
civilly
,
though
somewhat
coldly
,
ask
him
how
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
,
who
have
long
recognize
the
feature
of
his
old
acquaintance
Major
Bath
,
return
the
compliment
with
a
very
low
bow
;
but
do
not
venture
to
make
the
first
advance
to
familiarity
,
as
he
be
truly
possess
of
that
quality
which
the
Greeks
consider
in
the
high
light
of
honour
,
and
which
we
term
modesty
;
though
indeed
,
neither
our
nor
the
latin
language
hath
any
word
adequate
to
the
idea
of
the
original
.
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
,
after
have
discharge
himself
of
two
or
three
article
of
news
,
and
make
his
comment
upon
them
,
when
the
next
chair
to
him
become
vacant
,
call
upon
Booth
to
fill
it
.
<EOS>
He
then
ask
him
several
question
relate
to
his
affair
;
and
,
when
he
hear
he
be
out
of
the
army
,
advise
him
earnestly
to
use
all
mean
to
get
in
again
,
say
that
he
be
a
pretty
lad
,
and
they
must
not
lose
him
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
tell
him
in
a
whisper
that
he
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
him
on
that
subject
if
they
be
in
a
more
private
place
;
upon
this
the
colonel
propose
a
walk
in
the
Park
,
which
the
other
readily
accept
.
  
<EOS>
during
their
walk
Booth
open
his
heart
,
and
,
among
other
matter
,
acquaint
Colonel
Bath
that
he
fear
he
have
lose
the
friendship
of
Colonel
James
;
"
though
I
be
not
,
"
say
he
,
"
conscious
of
have
do
the
least
thing
to
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bath
answer
,
"
You
be
certainly
mistaken
,
Mr.
Booth
.
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
scarce
see
my
brother
since
my
come
to
town
;
for
I
have
be
here
but
two
day
;
however
,
I
be
convince
he
be
a
man
of
too
nice
honour
to
do
anything
inconsistent
with
the
true
dignity
of
a
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
Booth
answer
,
"
He
be
far
from
accuse
him
of
anything
dishonourable
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
D####n
me
,
"
say
Bath
,
"
if
there
be
a
man
alive
can
or
dare
accuse
him
:
if
you
have
the
least
reason
to
take
anything
ill
,
why
do
not
you
go
to
him
?
<EOS>
you
be
a
gentleman
,
and
his
rank
doth
not
protect
him
from
give
you
satisfaction
.
"
<EOS>
"
the
affair
be
not
of
any
such
kind
,
"
say
Booth
;
"
I
have
great
obligation
to
the
colonel
,
and
have
more
reason
to
lament
than
complain
;
and
,
if
I
could
but
see
him
,
I
be
convinced
I
should
have
no
cause
for
either
;
but
I
can
not
get
within
his
house
;
it
be
but
an
hour
ago
a
servant
of
his
turn
me
rudely
from
the
door
.
"
<EOS>
"
do
a
servant
of
my
brother
use
you
rudely
?
"
say
the
colonel
,
with
the
utmost
gravity
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
sir
,
in
what
light
you
see
such
thing
;
but
,
to
me
,
the
affront
of
a
servant
be
the
affront
of
the
master
;
and
if
he
doth
not
immediately
punish
it
,
by
all
the
dignity
of
a
man
<EOS>
,
I
would
see
the
master
's
nose
between
my
finger
.
"
<EOS>
Booth
offer
to
explain
,
but
to
no
purpose
;
the
colonel
be
get
into
his
stilt
;
and
it
be
impossible
to
take
him
down
,
nay
,
it
be
as
much
as
Booth
could
possibly
do
to
part
with
him
without
an
actual
quarrel
;
nor
would
he
,
perhaps
,
have
be
able
to
have
accomplish
it
,
have
not
the
colonel
by
accident
turn
at
last
to
take
Booth
's
side
of
the
question
;
and
before
they
separate
he
swear
many
oath
that
James
should
give
him
proper
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
end
of
this
present
interview
,
so
little
to
the
content
of
Booth
,
that
he
be
heartily
concern
he
have
ever
mention
a
syllable
of
the
matter
to
his
honourable
friend

whom
he
find
in
a
condition
very

poor
woman

very
great
apprehension

very
violently

and
what
be
bad
,
an
apothecary
have
be
with
her

and
frighten
her
almost
out
of
her
wit
.
<EOS>
He
have
indeed
represent
the
case
of
the
child
to
be
very
desperate
,
and
have
prevail
on
the
mother
to
call
in
the
assistance
of
a
doctor

Booth
have
be
a
very
little
time
in
the
room
before
this
doctor
arrive

with
the
apothecary
close
at
his

both
approach
the
bed
,
where
the
former
feel
the
pulse
of

and
perform
several
other
physical
ceremony

He
then
begin
to
enquire
of
the
apothecary
what
he
have
already
do
for
the
patient
;
all
which
,
as
soon
as
inform

sit
down
,
call
for
a
pen
and
ink
,
fill
a
whole
side
of
a
sheet
of
paper
with
physic

then
take
a
guinea

take
his
leave
;
the
apothecary
wait
upon
him
downstairs
,
as
he
have
attend
him
up

all
that
night
both
Amelia

Booth
sit
up
with
their
child

bad

a
rage

burn
hot

the
high
dejection

for
the
distemper
have
not
give
the
least
ground
to
all
the
effort
of
the
apothecary
and
doctor

seem
to
defy
their
utmost
power

with
all
that
tremendous
apparatus
of
phial

gallypot

be
arrange
in

very
well
-
breed
and
very
good
-
natured
man
,
he
address
himself
with
much
civility
to
his
brother
physician
,
who
be
not
quite
so
courteous
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
suffer
the
new
comer
to
be
conduct
to
the
sick
-
bed
,
and
at
Booth
's
earnest
request
to
deliver
his
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
the
dispute
which
ensue
between
the
two
physician
would
,
perhaps
,
be
unintelligible
to
any
but
those
of
the
faculty
,
and
not
very
entertaining
to
them
.
<EOS>
the
character
which
the
officer
and
Mrs.
Ellison
have
give
of
the
second
doctor
have
greatly
prepossess
Booth
in
his
favour
,
and
indeed
his
reasoning
seem
to
be
the
juster
.
<EOS>
Booth
therefore
declare
that
he
would
abide
by
his
advice
,
upon
which
the
former
operator
,
with
his
zany
,
the
apothecary
,
quit
the
field
,
and
leave
the
other
in
full
possession
of
the
sick
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
the
new
doctor
do
be
(
to
use
his
own
phrase
)
to
blow
up
the
physical
magazine
.
<EOS>
all
the
powder
and
potion
instantly
disappear
at
his
command
;
for
he
say
there
be
a
much
ready
and
near
way
to
convey
such
stuff
to
the
vault
,
than
by
first
send
it
through
the
human
body
.
<EOS>
He
then
order
the
child
to
be
blooded
,
give
it
a
clyster
and
some
cool
physic
,
and
,
in
short
(
that
I
may
not
dwell
too
long
on
so
unplease
a
part
of
history
)
,
within
three
day
cure
the
little
patient
of
her
distemper
,
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
Mrs.
Ellison
,
and
to
the
vast
joy
of
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
some
reader
will
,
perhaps
,
think
this
whole
chapter
may
have
be
omit
;
but
though
it
contain
no
great
matter
of
amusement
,
it
may
at
least
serve
to
inform
posterity
concern
the
present
state
of
physic

<EOS>
in
which
Booth
pay
a
visit
to
the
noble
lord
.
 
<EOS>
when
that
day
of
the
week
return
in
which
Mr.
Booth
choose
to
walk
abroad
,
he
go
to
wait
on
the
noble
peer
,
accord
to
his
kind
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
now
find
a
very
different
reception
with
this
great
man
's
porter
from
what
he
have
meet
with
at
his
friend
the
colonel
's
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
tell
his
name
than
the
porter
with
a
bow
<EOS>
tell
him
his
lordship
be
at
home
:
<EOS>
the
door
immediately
fly
wide
open
,
and
he
be
conduct
to
an
ante
-
chamber
,
where
a
servant
tell
him
he
would
acquaint
his
lordship
with
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
wait
many
minute
before
the
same
servant
return
and
usher
him
to
his
lordship
's
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
He
find
my
lord
alone
,
and
be
receive
by
him
in
the
most
courteous
manner
imaginable
.
<EOS>
after
the
first
ceremonial
be
over
,
his
lordship
begin
in
the
follow
word
:
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
,
I
do
assure
you
,
you
be
very
much
oblige
to
my
cousin
Ellison
.
<EOS>
She
hath
give
you
such
a
character
,
that
I
shall
have
a
pleasure
in
do
anything
in
my
power
to
serve
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
will
be
very
difficult
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
,
to
get
you
a
rank
at
home
.
<EOS>
in
the
West
Indies
,
perhaps
,
or
in
some
regiment
abroad
,
it
may
be
more
easy
;
and
,
when
I
consider
your
reputation
as
a
soldier
,
I
make
no
doubt
of
your
readiness
to
go
to
any
place
where
the
service
of
your
country
shall
call
you
.
"
<EOS>
Booth
answer
,
"
that
he
be
highly
oblige
to
his
lordship
,
and
assure
him
he
would
with
great
chearfulness
attend
his
duty
in
any
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
the
only
thing
grievous
in
the
exchange
of
country
,
"
say
he
,
"
in
my
opinion
,
be
to
leave
those
I
love
behind
me
,
and
I
be
sure
I
shall
never
have
a
second
trial
equal
to
my
first
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
hard
,
my
lord
,
to
leave
a
young
wife
big
with
her
first
child
,
and
so
affected
with
my
absence
,
that
I
have
the
utmost
reason
to
despair
of
ever
see
her
more
.
<EOS>
after
such
a
demonstration
of
my
resolution
to
sacrifice
every
other
consideration
to
my
duty
,
I
hope
your
lordship
will
honour
me
with
some
confidence
that
I
shall
make
no
objection
to
serve
in
any
country
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr.
Booth
,
"
answer
the
lord
,
"
you
speak
like
a
soldier
,
and
I
greatly
honour
your
sentiment
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
own
the
justice
of
your
inference
from
the
example
you
have
give
;
for
to
quit
a
wife
,
as
you
say
,
in
the
very
infancy
of
marriage
,
be
,
I
acknowledge
,
some
trial
of
resolution
.
"
<EOS>
Booth
answer
with
a
low
bow
;
and
then
,
after
some
immaterial
conversation
,
his
lordship
promise
to
speak
immediately
to
the
minister
,
and
appoint
Mr.
Booth
to
come
to
him
again
on
the
Wednesday
morning
,
that
he
may
be
acquaint
with
his
patron
's
success
.
<EOS>
the
poor
man
now
blush
and
look
silly
,
till
,
after
some
time
,
he
summon
up
all
his
courage
to
his
assistance
,
and
rely
on
the
other
's
friendship
,
he
open
the
whole
affair
of
his
circumstance
,
and
confess
that
he
do
not
dare
stir
from
his
lodging
above
one
day
in
seven
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
express
great
concern
at
this
account
,
and
very
kindly
promise
to
take
some
opportunity
of
call
on
him
at
his
cousin
Ellison
's
,
when
he
hope
,
he
say
,
to
bring
him
comfortable
tiding
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
soon
afterwards
take
his
leave
with
the
most
profuse
acknowledgment
for
so
much
goodness
,
and
hasten
home
to
acquaint
his
Amelia
with
what
have
so
greatly
overjoy
him
.
<EOS>
She
highly
congratulate
him
on
his
have
find
so
generous
and
powerful
a
friend
,
towards
whom
both
their
bosom
burn
with
the
warm
sentiment
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
,
however
,
content
till
she
have
make
Booth
renew
his
promise
,
in
the
most
solemn
manner
,
of
take
her
with
him
.
<EOS>
after
which
they
sit
down
with
their
little
child
to
a
scrag
of
mutton
and
broth
,
with
the
high
satisfaction
,
and
very
heartily
drink
his
lordship
's
health
in
a
pot
of
porter
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
this
happy
couple
,
if
the
reader
will
allow
me
to
call
poor
people
happy
,
drink
tea
with
Mrs.
Ellison
,
where
his
lordship
's
praise
,
be
again
repeat
by
both
the
husband
and
wife
,
be
very
loudly
echo
by
Mrs.
Ellison
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
here
,
the
young
lady
whom
we
have
mention
at
the
end
of
the
last
book
to
have
make
a
fourth
at
whist
,
and
with
whom
Amelia
seem
so
much
pleased
,
come
in
;
she
be
just
return
to
town
from
a
short
visit
in
the
country
,
and
her
present
visit
be
unexpected
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
very
agreeable
to
Amelia
,
who
like
her
still
better
upon
a
second
interview
,
and
be
resolve
to
solicit
her
further
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
still
maintain
some
little
reserve
,
but
be
much
more
familiar
and
communicative
than
before
.
<EOS>
She
appear
,
moreover
,
to
be
as
little
ceremonious
as
Mrs.
Ellison
have
report
her
,
and
very
readily
accept
Amelia
's
apology
for
not
pay
her
the
first
visit
,
and
agree
to
drink
tea
with
her
the
very
next
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
the
above
-
mention
company
be
sit
in
Mrs.
Ellison
's
parlour
,
serjeant
Atkinson
pass
by
the
window
and
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
no
sooner
see
him
than
she
say
,
"
pray
,
Mr.
Booth
,
who
be
that
genteel
young
serjeant
?
<EOS>
he
be
here
every
day
last
week
to
enquire
after
you
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
indeed
a
fact
;
the
serjeant
be
apprehensive
of
the
design
of
Murphy
;
but
,
as
the
poor
fellow
have
receive
all
his
answer
from
the
maid
of
Mrs.
Ellison
<EOS>
,
Booth
have
never
hear
a
word
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
greatly
pleased
with
what
he
be
now
tell
,
and
burst
forth
into
great
praise
of
the
serjeant
,
which
be
second
by
Amelia
,
who
add
that
he
be
her
foster
-
brother
,
and
,
she
believe
,
one
of
the
honest
fellow
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
will
swear
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Ellison
,
"
he
be
one
of
the
prettiest
.
<EOS>
do
,
Mr.
Booth
,
desire
him
to
walk
in
.
<EOS>
a
serjeant
of
the
guard
be
a
gentleman
;
and
I
have
rather
give
such
a
man
as
you
describe
a
dish
of
tea
than
any
Beau
fribble
of
them
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
want
no
great
solicitation
to
shew
any
kind
of
regard
to
Atkinson
;
and
,
accordingly
,
the
serjeant
be
usher
in
,
though
not
without
some
reluctance
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
perhaps
,
nothing
more
uneasy
than
those
sensation
which
the
french
call
the
mauvaise
honte
,
nor
any
more
difficult
to
conquer
;
and
poor
Atkinson
would
,
I
be
persuade
,
have
mount
a
breach
with
less
concern
than
he
shew
in
walk
across
a
room
before
three
lady
,
two
of
whom
be
his
avow
well
-
wisher
.
  
<EOS>
though
I
do
not
entirely
agree
with
the
late
learn
Mr.
Essex
,
the
celebrated
dancing
-
master
's
opinion
,
that
dancing
be
the
rudiment
of
polite
education
,
as
he
would
,
I
apprehend
,
exclude
every
other
art
and
science
,
yet
it
be
certain
that
person
whose
foot
have
never
be
under
the
hand
of
the
professor
of
that
art
be
apt
to
discover
this
want
in
their
education
in
every
motion
,
nay
,
even
when
they
stand
or
sit
still
.
<EOS>
They
seem
,
indeed
,
to
be
overburthene
with
limb
which
they
know
not
how
to
use
,
as
if
,
when
Nature
hath
finish
her
work
,
the
dancing
-
master
still
be
necessary
to
put
it
in
motion
.
  
<EOS>
Atkinson
be
,
at
present
,
an
example
of
this
observation
which
doth
so
much
honour
to
a
profession
for
which
I
have
a
very
high
regard
.
<EOS>
He
be
handsome
,
and
exquisitely
well
make
;
and
yet
,
as
he
have
never
learn
to
dance
,
he
make
so
awkward
an
appearance
in
Mrs.
Ellison
's
parlour
,
that
the
good
lady
herself
,
who
have
invite
him
in
,
could
at
first
scarce
refrain
from
laughter
at
his
behaviour
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
,
however
,
be
long
in
the
room
before
admiration
of
his
person
get
the
well
of
such
risible
idea
.
<EOS>
so
great
be
the
advantage
of
beauty
in
man
as
well
as
woman
,
and
so
sure
be
this
quality
in
either
sex
of
procure
some
regard
from
the
beholder
.
  
<EOS>
the
exceed
courteous
behaviour
of
Mrs.
Ellison
,
join
to
that
of
Amelia
and
Booth
,
at
length
dissipate
the
uneasiness
of
Atkinson
;
and
he
gain
sufficient
confidence
to
tell
the
company
some
entertaining
story
of
accident
that
have
happen
in
the
army
within
his
knowledge
,
which
,
though
they
greatly
please
all
present
,
be
not
,
however
,
of
consequence
enough
to
have
a
place
in
this
history
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
be
so
very
importunate
with
her
company
to
stay
supper
that
they
all
consent
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
serjeant
,
he
seem
to
be
none
of
the
least
welcome
guest
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
indeed
,
so
pleased
with
what
she
have
hear
of
him
,
and
what
she
see
of
him
,
that
,
when
a
little
warm
with
wine
,
for
she
be
no
flincher
at
the
bottle
,
she
begin
to
indulge
some
freedom
in
her
discourse
towards
him
that
a
little
offended
Amelia
's
delicacy
,
nay
,
they
do
not
seem
to
be
highly
relish
by
the
other
lady
;
though
I
be
far
from
insinuate
that
these
exceed
the
bound
of
decorum
,
or
be
,
indeed
,
great
liberty
than
lady
of
the
middle
age
,
and
especially
widow
,
do
frequently
allow
to
themselves
.
    
<EOS>
relate
principally
to
the
affair
of
serjeant
Atkinson
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
when
all
the
same
company
,
Atkinson
only
except
,
assemble
in
Amelia
's
apartment
,
Mrs.
Ellison
presently
begin
to
discourse
of
him
,
and
that
in
term
not
only
of
approbation
but
even
of
affection
.
<EOS>
She
call
him
her
clever
serjeant
,
and
her
dear
serjeant
,
repeat
often
that
he
be
the
pretty
fellow
in
the
army
,
and
say
it
be
a
thousand
pity
he
have
not
a
commission
;
for
that
,
if
he
have
,
she
be
sure
he
would
become
a
general
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
of
your
opinion
,
madam
,
"
answer
Booth
;
"
and
he
hath
get
one
hundred
pound
of
his
own
already
,
if
he
could
find
a
wife
now
to
help
him
to
two
or
three
hundred
more
,
I
think
he
may
easily
get
a
commission
in
a
marching
regiment
;
for
I
be
convince
there
be
no
colonel
in
the
army
would
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
refuse
him
,
indeed
!
"
say
Mrs.
Ellison
;
"
no
;
he
would
be
a
very
pretty
colonel
that
do
.
<EOS>
and
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
believe
there
be
very
few
lady
who
would
refuse
him
,
if
he
have
but
<EOS>
a
proper
opportunity
of
solicit
them
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
and
the
lady
both
would
be
well
off
than
with
one
of
those
pretty
master
that
I
see
walk
about
,
and
drag
their
long
sword
after
them
,
when
they
should
rather
drag
their
leading
-
string
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
say
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
and
speak
like
a
woman
of
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
believe
they
would
be
both
better
serve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
,
captain
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Ellison
;
"
I
would
rather
leave
the
two
first
syllable
out
of
the
word
gentleman
than
the
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
assure
you
,
"
reply
Booth
,
"
there
be
not
a
quieter
creature
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
though
the
fellow
hath
the
bravery
of
a
lion
,
he
hath
the
meekness
of
a
lamb
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
story
enow
of
that
kind
,
and
so
can
my
dear
Amelia
,
when
he
be
a
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
if
the
match
stick
there
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
<EOS>
I
positively
will
not
spoil
his
fortune
by
my
silence
.
<EOS>
I
can
answer
for
him
from
his
infancy
,
that
he
be
one
of
the
best
-
natured
lad
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
a
story
or
two
of
him
,
the
truth
of
which
I
can
testify
from
my
own
knowledge
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
but
<EOS>
six
year
old
he
be
at
play
with
me
at
my
mother
's
house
,
and
a
great
pointer
-
dog
bite
him
through
the
leg
.
<EOS>
the
poor
lad
,
in
the
midst
of
the
anguish
of
his
wound
,
declare
he
be
overjoy
<EOS>
it
have
not
happen
to
miss
(
for
the
same
dog
<EOS>
have
just
before
snapt
at
me
,
and
my
petticoat
have
be
my
defence
)
.
 
<EOS>
another
instance
of
his
goodness
,
which
greatly
recommend
him
to
my
father
,
and
which
I
have
love
him
for
ever
since
,
be
this
:
my
father
be
a
great
lover
of
bird
,
and
strictly
forbad
the
spoiling
of
their
nest
.
<EOS>
poor
Joe
be
one
day
catch
upon
a
tree
,
and
,
be
conclude
guilty
,
be
severely
lash
for
it
;
but
it
be
afterwards
discover
that
another
boy
,
a
friend
of
Joe
's
,
have
rob
the
nest
of
its
young
one
,
and
poor
Joe
have
climb
the
tree
in
order
to
restore
them
,
notwithstanding
which
,
he
submit
to
the
punishment
rather
than
he
would
impeach
his
companion
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
these
story
appear
childish
and
trifling
,
the
duty
and
kindness
he
hath
shew
to
his
mother
must
recommend
him
to
every
one
.
<EOS>
ever
since
he
hath
be
fifteen
year
old
he
hath
<EOS>
more
than
half
support
her
:
and
when
my
brother
die
,
I
remember
particularly
,
Joe
,
at
his
desire
,
for
he
be
much
his
favourite
,
have
one
of
his
suit
give
him
;
but
,
instead
of
his
become
fine
on
that
occasion
,
another
young
fellow
come
to
church
in
my
brother
's
cloath
,
and
my
old
nurse
appear
the
same
Sunday
in
a
new
gown
,
which
her
son
have
purchase
for
her
with
the
sale
of
his
legacy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
protest
,
he
be
a
very
worthy
creature
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bennet
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
charming
fellow
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Ellison
 
"
<EOS>
but
then
the
name
of
serjeant
,
Captain
Booth
;
there
,
as
the
play
say
,
my
pride
bring
me
off
again
.
"
            
<EOS>
and
whatsoever
the
sage
charge
on
pride
,
     
<EOS>
the
angel
'
fall
,
and
twenty
other
good
fault
beside
;
     
<EOS>
on
earth
<EOS>
I
be
sure
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
 
something
 
<EOS>
call
     
Pride
save
man
,
and
our
sex
too
,
from
fall
.
    
<EOS>
here
a
footman
's
rap
at
the
door
shake
the
room
.
<EOS>
upon
which
Mrs.
Ellison
,
run
to
the
window
,
cry
out
,
"
let
me
die
if
it
be
not
my
lord
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
must
be
at
home
to
him
;
but
suppose
he
should
enquire
for
you
,
captain
,
what
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
or
will
you
go
down
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
company
be
in
some
confusion
at
this
instant
,
and
before
they
have
agree
on
anything
,
Booth
's
little
girl
come
run
into
the
room
,
and
say
,
"
there
be
a
prodigious
great
gentleman
come
up-
stair
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
immediately
follow
by
his
lordship
,
who
,
as
he
know
Booth
must
be
at
home
,
make
very
little
or
no
enquiry
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
be
take
somewhat
at
a
surprize
,
but
she
be
too
polite
to
shew
much
confusion
;
for
,
though
she
know
nothing
of
the
town
,
she
have
have
a
genteel
education
,
and
keep
the
good
company
the
country
afford
.
<EOS>
the
ceremony
therefore
past
as
usual
,
and
they
all
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
soon
address
himself
to
Booth
,
say
,
"
as
I
have
what
I
think
good
news
for
you
,
sir
,
I
could
not
delay
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
communicate
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
mention
your
affair
where
I
promise
you
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
of
my
success
.
<EOS>
one
may
easily
perceive
,
you
know
,
from
the
manner
of
people
's
behave
upon
such
occasion
;
and
,
indeed
,
when
I
relate
your
case
,
I
find
there
be
much
inclination
to
serve
you
.
<EOS>
great
man
,
Mr.
Booth
,
must
do
thing
in
their
own
time
;
but
I
think
you
may
depend
on
have
something
do
very
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
make
many
acknowledgment
for
his
lordship
's
goodness
,
and
now
a
second
time
pay
all
the
thank
which
would
have
be
due
,
even
have
the
favour
be
obtain
.
<EOS>
this
art
of
promising
be
the
economy
of
a
great
man
's
pride
,
a
sort
of
good
husbandry
in
confer
favour
,
by
which
they
receive
tenfold
in
acknowledgment
for
every
obligation
,
I
mean
among
those
who
really
intend
the
service
;
for
there
be
other
who
cheat
poor
man
of
their
thank
,
without
ever
design
to
deserve
them
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
this
matter
be
sufficiently
discuss
,
the
conversation
take
a
gayer
turn
;
and
my
lord
begin
to
entertain
the
lady
with
some
of
that
elegant
discourse
which
,
though
most
delightful
to
hear
,
it
be
impossible
should
ever
be
read
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
be
so
highly
pleased
with
Amelia
,
that
he
could
not
help
be
somewhat
particular
to
her
;
but
this
particularity
distinguish
itself
only
in
a
high
degree
of
respect
,
and
be
so
very
polite
,
and
so
very
distant
,
that
she
herself
be
pleased
,
and
at
his
departure
,
which
be
not
till
he
have
far
exceed
the
length
of
a
common
visit
,
declare
he
be
the
fine
gentleman
she
have
ever
see
;
with
which
sentiment
her
husband
and
Mrs.
Ellison
both
entirely
concur
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
,
on
the
contrary
,
expr
some
little
dislike
to
my
lord
's
complaisance
,
which
she
call
excessive
.
"
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
have
not
the
least
relish
for
those
very
fine
gentleman
;
what
the
world
generally
call
politeness
,
I
term
insincerity
;
and
I
be
more
charm
with
the
story
which
Mrs.
Booth
tell
us
of
the
honest
serjeant
than
with
all
that
the
fine
gentleman
in
the
world
ever
say
in
their
life
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
o
!
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Ellison
;
"
all
for
Love
,
or
the
World
well
lose
,
be
a
motto
very
proper
for
some
folk
to
wear
in
their
coat
of
arm
;
but
the
generality
of
the
world
will
,
I
believe
,
agree
with
that
lady
's
opinion
of
my
cousin
,
rather
than
with
Mrs.
Bennet
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
,
see
Mrs.
Ellison
take
offence
at
what
she
say
,
think
proper
to
make
some
apology
,
which
be
very
readily
accept
,
and
so
end
the
visit
.
  
<EOS>
We
can
not
however
put
an
end
to
the
chapter
without
observe
that
such
be
the
ambitious
temper
of
beauty
,
that
it
may
always
apply
to
itself
that
celebrate
passage
in
Lucan
,
  
<EOS>
Nec
quenquam
jam
ferre
potest
Caesarve
priorem
,
Pompeiusve
parem
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
believe
,
it
may
be
lay
down
as
a
general
rule
,
that
no
woman
who
hath
any
great
pretension
to
admiration
be
ever
well
pleased
in
a
company
where
she
perceive
herself
to
fill
only
the
second
place
.
<EOS>
this
observation
,
however
,
I
humbly
submit
to
the
judgment
of
the
lady
,
and
hope
it
will
be
consider
as
retract
by
me
if
they
shall
dissent
from
my
opinion
.
    
<EOS>
contain
matter
that
require
no
preface
.
 
<EOS>
when
Booth
and
his
wife
be
leave
alone
together
they
both
extremely
exult
in
their
good
fortune
in
have
find
so
good
a
friend
as
his
lordship
;
nor
be
they
want
in
very
warm
expression
of
gratitude
towards
Mrs.
Ellison
.
<EOS>
after
which
they
begin
to
lay
down
scheme
of
living
when
Booth
should
have
his
commission
of
captain
;
and
,
after
the
exact
computation
,
conclude
that
,
with
economy
,
they
should
be
able
to
save
at
least
fifty
pound
a
-
year
out
of
their
income
in
order
to
pay
their
debt
.
  
<EOS>
these
matter
be
well
settle
,
Amelia
ask
Booth
what
he
think
of
Mrs.
Bennet
?
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
my
dear
,
"
answer
Booth
,
"
that
she
hath
be
formerly
a
very
pretty
woman
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
mistaken
,
"
reply
she
,
"
if
she
be
not
a
very
good
creature
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
I
ever
take
such
a
liking
to
any
one
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
she
hath
be
a
very
spritely
woman
;
for
,
if
you
observe
,
she
discover
by
start
a
great
vivacity
in
her
countenance
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
make
the
same
observation
,
"
cry
Booth
:
"
<EOS>
sure
some
strange
misfortune
hath
befall
her
.
"
<EOS>
"
a
misfortune
,
indeed
!
"
answer
Amelia
;
"
sure
,
child
,
you
forget
what
Mrs.
Ellison
tell
us
,
that
she
have
lose
a
beloved
husband
.
<EOS>
a
misfortune
which
I
have
often
wonder
at
any
woman
's
surviving
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
she
cast
a
tender
look
at
Booth
,
and
presently
afterwards
,
throw
herself
upon
his
neck
,
cry
,
"
o
,
Heavens
!
<EOS>
what
a
happy
creature
be
I
!
<EOS>
when
I
consider
the
danger
you
have
go
through
,
how
I
exult
in
my
bliss
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
good
-
natured
reader
will
suppose
that
Booth
be
not
deficient
in
return
such
tenderness
,
after
which
the
conversation
become
too
fond
to
be
here
relate
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
Mrs.
Ellison
address
herself
to
Booth
as
follow
:
"
I
shall
make
no
apology
,
sir
,
for
what
I
be
go
to
say
,
as
it
proceed
from
my
friendship
to
yourself
and
your
dear
lady
.
<EOS>
I
be
convince
then
,
sir
,
there
be
a
something
more
than
accident
in
your
go
abroad
only
one
day
in
the
week
.
<EOS>
now
,
sir
,
if
,
as
I
be
afraid
,
matter
be
not
altogether
as
well
as
I
wish
them
,
I
beg
,
since
I
do
not
believe
you
be
provide
with
a
lawyer
,
that
you
will
suffer
me
to
recommend
one
to
you
.
<EOS>
the
person
I
shall
mention
be
,
I
assure
you
,
of
much
ability
in
his
profession
,
and
I
have
know
him
do
great
service
to
gentleman
under
a
cloud
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
ashamed
of
your
circumstance
,
my
dear
friend
<EOS>
:
they
be
a
much
great
scandal
to
those
who
have
leave
so
much
merit
unprovided
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
give
Mrs.
Ellison
abundance
of
thank
for
her
kindness
,
and
explicitly
confess
to
her
that
her
conjecture
be
right
,
and
,
without
hesitation
,
accept
the
offer
of
her
friend
's
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
then
acquaint
him
with
her
apprehension
on
his
account
.
<EOS>
She
say
she
have
both
yesterday
and
this
morning
see
two
or
three
<EOS>
very
ugly
suspicious
fellow
pass
several
time
by
her
window
.
<EOS>
"
upon
all
account
,
"
say
she
,
"
my
dear
sir
,
I
advise
you
to
keep
yourself
close
confine
till
the
lawyer
hath
be
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
will
get
you
your
liberty
,
at
least
of
walk
about
within
the
verge
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
to
be
do
with
the
board
of
green
-
cloth
;
I
do
not
know
what
;
but
this
I
know
,
that
several
gentleman
have
live
here
a
long
time
very
comfortably
,
and
have
defy
all
the
vengeance
of
their
creditor
.
<EOS>
however
,
in
the
mean
time
,
you
must
be
a
close
prisoner
with
your
lady
;
and
I
believe
there
be
no
man
in
England
but
would
exchange
his
liberty
for
the
same
gaol
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
depart
in
order
to
send
for
the
attorney
,
and
presently
afterwards
the
serjeant
arrive
with
news
of
the
like
kind
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
scrape
an
acquaintance
with
Murphy
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
your
honour
will
pardon
me
,
"
cry
Atkinson
,
"
but
I
pretend
to
have
a
small
demand
upon
your
honour
myself
,
and
offer
to
employ
him
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
upon
which
he
tell
me
that
,
if
I
would
go
with
him
to
the
Marshal
's
court
,
and
make
affidavit
of
my
debt
,
he
should
be
able
very
shortly
to
get
it
me
;
for
I
shall
have
the
captain
in
hold
,
"
cry
he
,
"
within
a
day
or
two
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
say
the
serjeant
,
"
I
could
do
your
honour
any
service
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
walk
about
all
day
before
the
door
?
<EOS>
or
shall
I
be
porter
,
and
watch
it
in
the
inside
till
your
honour
can
find
some
mean
of
secure
yourself
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
be
offend
at
me
,
but
I
beg
you
would
take
care
of
fall
into
Murphy
's
hand
;
for
he
hath
the
character
of
the
great
villain
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
you
will
think
me
too
bold
,
sir
;
but
I
have
a
little
money
;
if
it
can
be
of
any
service
,
do
,
pray
your
honour
,
command
it
.
<EOS>
It
can
never
do
me
so
much
good
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
consider
,
sir
<EOS>
,
I
owe
all
I
have
to
yourself
and
my
dear
mistress
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
stand
a
moment
,
as
if
he
have
be
thunderstruck
,
and
then
,
the
tear
burst
from
his
eye
,
he
say
,
"
upon
my
soul
,
Atkinson
,
you
overcome
me
.
<EOS>
I
scarce
ever
hear
of
<EOS>
so
 
much
goodness
,
nor
do
I
know
how
to
express
my
sentiment
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
be
assure
,
as
for
your
money
,
I
will
not
accept
it
;
and
let
it
satisfy
you
,
that
in
my
present
circumstance
it
would
do
me
no
essential
service
;
but
this
be
assure
of
likewise
,
that
whilst
I
live
I
shall
never
forget
the
kindness
of
the
offer
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
apprehend
I
may
be
in
some
danger
of
fellow
get
into
the
house
,
for
a
day
or
two
,
as
I
have
no
guard
but

poor
little
girl

I
will
not
refuse
the
goodness
you
offer
to
shew
in
my
protection
.
<EOS>
and
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Ellison
will
let
you
sit
in
her
parlour
for
that
purpose
.
"
  
<EOS>
Atkinson
,
with
the
utmost
readiness
,
undertake
the
office
of
porter
;
and
Mrs.
Ellison
as
readily
allot
him
a
place
in
her
back
-
parlour
,
where
he
continue
three
day
together
,
from
eight
in
the
morning
till
twelve
at
night
;
during
which
time
,
he
have
sometimes
the
company
of
Mrs.
Ellison
,
and
sometimes
of
Booth
,
Amelia
,
and
Mrs.
Bennet
too
;
for
this
last
have
take
as
great
a
fancy
to
Amelia
as
Amelia
have
to
her
,
and
,
therefore
,
as
Mr.
Booth
's
affair
be
now
no
secret
in
the
neighbourhood
,
make
her
frequent
visit
during
the
confinement
of
her
husband
,
and
consequently
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
,
as
I
remember
,
happen
in
this
interval
of
time
,
more
worthy
notice
than
the
follow
card
which
Amelia
receive
from
her
old
acquaintance
Mrs.
James
:
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
James
send
her
compliment
to
Mrs.
Booth
,
and
desire
to
know
how
she
do
;
for
,
as
she
hath
not
have
the
favour
of
see
her
at
her
own
house
,
or
of
meet
her
in
any
public
place
,
in
so
long
time
,
fear
it
may
be
owe
to
ill
health
.
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
have
long
give
over
all
thought
of
her
friend
,
and
doubt
not
but
that
she
be
as
entirely
give
over
by
her
;
she
be
very
much
surprize
at
this
message
,
and
under
some
doubt
whether
it
be
not
mean
as
an
insult
,
especially
from
the
mention
of
public
place
,
which
she
think
so
inconsistent
with
her
present
circumstance
,
of
which
she
suppose
Mrs.
James
be
well
apprize
.
<EOS>
however
,
at
the
entreaty
of
her
husband
,
who
languish
for
nothing
more
than
to
be
again
reconcile
to
his
friend
James
,
Amelia
undertake
to
pay
the
lady
a
visit
,
and
to
examine
into
the
mystery
of
this
conduct
,
which
appear
to
her
so
unaccountable
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
James
receive
her
with
a
degree
of
civility
that
amaze
Amelia
no
less
than
her
coldness
have
do
before
.
<EOS>
She
resolve
to
come
to
an
eclaircissement
,
and
,
have
sit
out
some
company
that
come
in
,
when
they
be
alone
together
Amelia
,
after
some
silence
and
many
offer
to
speak
,
at
last
say
,
"
My
dear
Jenny
(
if
you
will
now
suffer
me
to
call
you
by
so
familiar
a

,
have
you
entirely
forget
a
certain
young
lady
who
have
the
pleasure
of
be
your
intimate
acquaintance
at
Montpelier

<EOS>
"
whom
do
you

Mrs.

with
great
concern

<EOS>
"
I

Amelia

<EOS>
"
You
surprize
me
,

Mrs.
James
:
"
how
can
you
ask
me
that
question

"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
dear
,
I
do
not
intend
to
offend
you
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
but
I
be
really
desirous
to
solve
to
myself
the
reason
of
that
coldness
which
you
shew
me
when
you
do
me
the
favour
of
a
visit
.
<EOS>
Can
you
think
,
my

I
be
not
disappointed
,
when
I
expect
to
meet
an
intimate
friend

to
receive
a
cold
formal
visitant
?
<EOS>
I
desire
you
to
examine
your
own
heart
and
answer
me
honestly
if
you
do
not
think
I
have
some
little
reason
to
be
dissatisfy
with
your
behaviour

<EOS>
"
indeed

Mrs.
Booth

"
answer
the
other
lady
,
"
you
surprize
me
very
much
;
if
there
be
anything
displease
to
you
in
my
behaviour
<EOS>
I

extremely
concerned
at
it

<EOS>
I
do
not

I

Amelia

Could
I

when
I

the

meet
her

of
the

of
climb
up
two

with
the
distant

do

I

sure
be

more
than
all
the

,
indeed

as
I

I
really

you
be
ill

"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
mention
public
place
to

,
"
say
Amelia

no

why

sure

my

"
cry
Amelia

"
you
could
not

that
we

circumstance

in

a
place

and
in
such
a
condition

"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
dear
,
"
answer
Mrs.
James
,
"
since
you
be
pleased
to
mention
it
first
yourself
<EOS>
,
I
own
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
surprized
to
see
you
in
no
well
lodging
;
but
I
conclude
you
have
your
own
reason
for
like
them
;
and
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
lay
it
down
as
a
positive
rule
never
to
enquire
into
the
private
affair
of
any
one
,
especially
of
my
friend
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
of
the
humour
of
some
lady
,
who
confine
the
circle
of
their
acquaintance
to
one
part
of
the
town
,
and
would
not
be
know
to
visit
in
the
city
for
the
world

<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
never
dropt
an
acquaintance
with
any
one
while
it
be
reputable
to
keep
it
up
;
and
I
can
solemnly
declare
I
have
not
a
friend
in
the
world
for
whom
I
have
a
great
esteem
than
I
have
for
Mrs.
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
instant
the
arrival
of
a
new
visitant
put
an
end
to
the
discourse
;
and
Amelia
soon
after
take
her
leave
without
the
least
anger
,
but
with
some
little
unavoidable
contempt
for
a
lady
,
in
whose
opinion
,
as
we
have
hint
before
,
<EOS>
outward
form
and
ceremony
constitute
the
whole
essence
of
friendship
;
who
value
all
her
acquaintance
alike
,
as
each
individual
serve
equally
to
fill
up
a
place
in
her
visit
roll
;
and
who
,
in
reality
,
have
not
the
least
concern
for
the
good
quality
or
well
-
being
of
any
of
them
.
    
<EOS>
contain
much
heroic
matter
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
three
day
Mrs.
Ellison
's
friend
have
so
far
purchase
Mr.
Booth
's
liberty
that
he
could
walk
again
abroad
within
the
verge
without
any
danger
of
have
a
warrant
back
against
him
by
the
board
before
he
have
notice
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
ill
-
look
person
that
have
give
the
alarm
,
it
be
now
discover
that
another
unhappy
gentleman
,
and
not
Booth
,
be
the
object
of
their
pursuit
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
,
now
be
deliver
from
his
fear
,
go
,
as
he
have
formerly
do
,
to
take
his
morning
walk
in
the
Park
.
<EOS>
here
he
meet
Colonel
Bath
in
company
with
some
other
officer
,
and
very
civilly
pay
his
respect
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
instead
of
return
the
salute
,
the
colonel
look
him
full
in
the
face
with
a
very
stern
countenance
;
and
,
if
he
could
be
say
to
take
any
notice
of
him
,
it
be
in
such
a
manner
as
to
inform
him
he
would
take
no
notice
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
not
more
hurt
than
surprized
at
this
behaviour
,
and
resolve
to
know
the
reason
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
watch
an
opportunity
till
the
colonel
be
alone
,
and
then
walk
boldly
up
to
him
,
and
desire
to
know
if
he
have
give
him
any
offence
?
<EOS>
the
colonel
answer
hastily
,
"
Sir
,
I
be
above
be
offend
with
you
,
nor
do
I
think
it
consistent
with
my
dignity
to
make
you
any
answer
.
"
<EOS>
Booth
reply
,
"
I
do
not
know
,
sir
,
that
I
have
do
anything
to
deserve
this
treatment
.
"
<EOS>
"
Look'ee
,
sir
,
"
cry
the
colonel
,
"
if
I
have
not
formerly
have
some
respect
for
you
,
I
should
not
think
you
worth
my
resentment
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
you
be
a
gentleman
bear
,
and
an
officer
,
and
as
I
have
have
an
esteem
for
you
,
I
will
give
you
some
mark
of
it
by
put
it
in
your
power
to
do
yourself
justice
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
therefore
,
sir
,
that
you
have
act
like
a
scoundrel
.
"
<EOS>
"
if
we
be
not
in
the
Park
,
"
answer
Booth
warmly
,
"
I
would
thank
you
very
properly
for
that
compliment
.
"
<EOS>
"
o
,
sir
,
"
cry
the
colonel
,
"
we
can
be
soon
in
a
convenient
place
.
<EOS>
"
upon
which
Booth
answer
,
he
would
attend
him
wherever
he
please
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
then
bid
him
come
along
,
and
strut
forward
directly
up
Constitution
-
hill
to
Hyde
-
park
,
<EOS>
Booth
follow
him
at
first
,
and
afterwards
walk
before
him
,
till
they
come
to
that
place
which
may
be
properly
call
the
field
of
blood
,
be
that
part
,
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
ring
,
which
hero
have
choose
for
the
scene
of
their
exit
out
of
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
reach
the
ring
some
time
before
the
colonel
;
for
he
mend
not
his
pace
any
more
than
a
Spaniard
.
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
I
believe
it
be
not
in
his
power
:
for
he
have
so
long
accustomed
himself
to
one
and
the
same
strut
,
that
as
a
horse
,
use
always
to
trot
,
can
scarce
be
force
into
a
gallop
,
so
could
no
passion
force
the
colonel
to
alter
his
pace
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
both
party
arrive
at
the
list
,
where
the
colonel
very
deliberately
take
off
his
wig
and
coat
,
and
lay
them
on
the
grass
,
and
then
,
draw
his
sword
,
advance
to
Booth
,
who
have
likewise
his
draw
weapon
in
his
hand
,
but
have
make
no
other
preparation
for
the
combat
.
  
<EOS>
the
combatant
now
engage
with
great
fury
,
and
,
after
two
or
three
pass
,
Booth
run
the
colonel
through
the
body
and
throw
him
on
the
ground
,
at
the
same
time
possess
himself
of
the
colonel
's
sword
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
colonel
be
become
master
of
his
speech
,
he
call
out
to
Booth
in
a
very
kind
voice
,
and
say
,
"
You
have
do
my
business
,
and
satisfy
me
that
you
be
a
man
of
honour
,
and
that
my
brother
James
must
have
be
mistake
;
for
I
be
convinced
that
no
man
who
will
draw
his
sword
in
so
gallant
<EOS>
a
manner
be
capable
of
be
a
rascal

<EOS>
D####n
me

give
me
a
buss

my
dear
boy
;
I
ask
your
pardon
for
that
infamous
appellation
I
dishonour
your
dignity
with
;
but
d####n
me
if
it
be
not
purely
out
of
love
,
and
to
give
you
an
opportunity
of
do
yourself
justice
,
which
I
own
you
have
do
like
a
man
of
honour

<EOS>
what
may
be
the
consequence
I
know
not
,
but
I
hope
,
at
least
,
I
shall
live
to
reconcile
you
with
my
brother

<EOS>
Booth
shew
great
concern
,
and
even
horror
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
colonel
,
"
say
he
,
"
would
you
force
me
to
this
?
<EOS>
for
Heaven
's

tell
me
what
I
have
ever
do
to
offend
you

Me

the
colonel

<EOS>
indeed
,
my
dear
child
,
you
never
do
anything
to
offend
me

<EOS>
Nay
,
I
have
act
the
part
of
a
friend
to
you
in
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
I
maintain
your
cause
with
my
brother
as
long
as
decency
would
permit
;
I
could
not
flatly
contradict
him
,
though
,
indeed
,
I
scarce
believe
him
.
<EOS>
but
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
if
I
have
not
fight
with
you
,
I
must
have
be
oblige
to
have
fight
with
him
;
however
,
I
hope
what
be
do
will
be
sufficient
,
and
that
matter
may
be
discomodate
without
your
be
put
to
the
necessity
of
fight
any
more
on
this
occasion

"
never

Booth
eagerly
;
"
for
Heaven
's

think
of
your

me
put
you
into
a
chair
,

get
you
a
surgeon

Thou
art

noble
lad

the
colonel
,
who
be
now
get
on
his
leg

and
I
be
glad
the
business
be
so
well
over
;
for
,
though
your
sword
go
quite
through
<EOS>
,
it
slant
so
that
I
apprehend
there
be
little
danger
of
life
:
however
,
I
think
there
be
enough
do
to
put
an
honourable
end
to
the
affair
,
especially
as
you
be
so
hasty
to
disarm
me
.
<EOS>
I
bleed
a
little
,
but
I
can
walk
to
the
house
by
the
water
;
and
,
if
you
will
send
me
a
chair
thither
,
I
shall
be
oblige
to
you
.

<EOS>
as
the
colonel
refuse
any
assistance
(
indeed
he
be
very
able
to
walk
without
it
,
though
with
somewhat
less
dignity
than
usual
)
,
Booth
set
forward
to
Grosvenor

gate

in
order
to
procure
the
chair
,
and
soon
after
return
with
one
to
his
friend
;
whom
have
convey
into
it
,
he
attend
himself
on
foot
into
bond
-
street
,
where
then
live
a
very
eminent
surgeon
.
  
<EOS>
the
surgeon
have
probe
the
wound
,
turn
towards
Booth
,
who
be
apparently
the
guilty
person
,
and
say
,
with
a
smile
,
"
upon
my
word
,
sir
,
you
have
perform
the
business
with
great
dexterity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
cry
the
colonel
to
the
surgeon
,
"
I
would
not
have
you
imagine
I
be
afraid
to
die
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
know
more
what
belong
to
the
dignity
of
a
man
;
and
,
I
believe
,
I
have
shew
it
at
the
head
of
a
line
of
battle
.
<EOS>
do
not
impute
my
concern
to
that
fear
,
when
I
ask
you
whether
there
be
or
be
not
any
danger
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
really
,
colonel
,
"
answer
the
surgeon
,
who
well
know
the
complexion
of
the
gentleman
then
under
his
hand
,
"
it
would
appear
like
presumption
to
say
that
a
man
who
hath
be
just
run
through
the
body
be
in
no
manner
of
danger
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
think
I
may
assure
you
,
that
I
yet
perceive
no
very
bad
symptom
,
and
,
unless
something
bad
should
appear
,
or
a
fever
be
the
consequence
,
I
hope
you
may
live
to
be
again
,
with
all
your
dignity
,
at
the
head
of
a
line
of
battle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
that
be
your
opinion
,
"
quoth
the
colonel
,
"
for
I
be
not
desirous
of
die
,
though
I
be
not
afraid
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
anything
bad
than
you
apprehend
should
happen
,
I
desire
you
will
be
a
witness
of
my
declaration
that
this
young
gentleman
be
entirely
innocent
.
<EOS>
I
force
him
to
do
what
he
do
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Booth
,
I
be
pleased
matter
<EOS>
be
as
they
be
.
<EOS>
You
be
the
first
man
that
ever
gain
an
advantage
over
me
;
but
it
be
very
lucky
for
you
that
you
disarm
me
,
and
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
you
have
the
equananimity
to
think
so
.
<EOS>
if
the
business
,
therefore
,
hath
end
without
do
anything
to
the
purpose
,
it
be
Fortune
's
pleasure
,
and
neither
of
our
fault
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
heartily
embrace
the
colonel
,
and
assure
him
of
the
great
satisfaction
he
have
receive
from
the
surgeon
's
opinion
;
and
soon
after
the
two
combatant
take
their
leave
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
,
after
he
be
dr
,
go
in
a
chair
to
his
lodging
,
and
Booth
walk
on
foot
to
his
;
where
he
luckily
arrive
without
meet
any
of
Mr.
Murphy
's
gang
;
a
danger
which
never
once
occur
to
his
imagination
till
he
be
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
affair
he
have
be
about
have
indeed
so
entirely
occupy
his
mind
,
that
it
have
obliterate
every
other
idea
;
among
the
rest
,
it
cause
him
so
absolutely
to
forget
the
time
of
the
day
,
that
,
though
he
have
exceed
the
time
of
dining
above
two
hour
,
he
have
not
the
least
suspicion
of
be
at
home
later
than
usual
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
reader
will
find
matter
worthy
his
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
,
have
wait
above
an
hour
for
her
husband
,
conclude
,
as
he
be
the
most
punctual
man
alive
,
that
he
have
meet
with
some
engagement
abroad
,
and
sit
down
to
her
meal
with
her
child
;
which
,
as
it
be
always
uncomfortable
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
,
be
very
short
;
so
that
,
before
his
return
,
all
the
apparatus
of
dining
be
entirely
remove
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
sit
some
time
with
his
wife
,
expect
every
minute
when
the
little
maid
would
make
her
appearance
;
at
last
,
curiosity
,
I
believe
,
rather
than
appetite
,
make
him
ask
how
long
it
be
to
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
dinner
,
my
dear
!
"
answer
Amelia
;
"
sure
you
have
dine
,
I
hope
?
"
<EOS>
Booth
reply
in
the
negative
;
upon
which
his
wife
start
from
her
chair
,
and
bestir
herself
as
nimbly
to
provide
him
a
repast
as
the
most
industrious
hostess
in
the
kingdom
doth
when
some
unexpected
guest
of
extraordinary
quality
arrive
at
her
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
hath
not
,
I
think
,
from
any
passage
hitherto
record
in
this
history
,
have
much
reason
to
accuse
Amelia
of
a
blameable
curiosity
<EOS>
;
he
will
not
,
I
hope
,
conclude
that
she
give
an
instance
of
any
such
fault
when
,
upon
Booth
's
have
so
long
overstay
his
time
,
and
so
greatly
mistaken
the
hour
of
the
day
,
and
upon
some
other
circumstance
of
his
behaviour
(
for
he
be
too
honest
to
be
good
at
conceal
any
of
his
thought
)
<EOS>
,
she
say
to
him
after
he
have
do
eating
,
"
My
dear
,
I
be
sure
something
more
than
<EOS>
ordinary
hath
happen
to
-
day
,
and
I
beg
you
will
tell
me
what
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
answer
that
nothing
of
any
consequence
have
happen
;
that
he
have
be
detain
by
a
friend
,
whom
he
meet
accidently
,
longer
than
he
expect
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
make
many
shuffling
and
evasive
answer
,
not
boldly
lie
out
,
which
,
perhaps
,
would
have
succeed
,
but
poorly
and
vainly
endeavour
to
reconcile
falsehood
with
truth
;
an
attempt
which
seldom
fail
to
betray
the
most
practised
deceiver
.
  
<EOS>
how
impossible
be
it
therefore
for
poor
Booth
to
succeed
in
an
art
for
which
nature
have
so
entirely
disqualify
him
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
,
indeed
,
confess
faster
than
his
tongue
deny
,
and
the
whole
of
his
behaviour
give
Amelia
an
alarm
,
and
make
her
suspect
something
very
bad
have
happen
;
and
,
as
her
thought
turn
presently
on
the
badness
of
their
circumstance
,
she
fear
some
mischief
from
his
creditor
have
befall
him
;
for
she
be
too
ignorant
of
such
matter
to
know
that
,
if
he
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
(
which
be
the
name
give
by
the
faithful
to
bailiff
)
,
he
would
hardly
have
be
able
so
soon
to
recover
his
liberty
.
<EOS>
Booth
at
last
perceive
her
to
be
so
uneasy
,
that
,
as
he
see
no
hope
of
contrive
any
fiction
to
satisfy
her
,
he
think
himself
oblige
to
tell
her
the
truth
,
or
at
least
part
of
the
truth
,
and
confess
that
he
have
have
a
little
skirmish
with
Colonel
Bath
,
in
which
,
he
say
,
the
colonel
have
receive
a
slight
wound
,
not
at
all
dangerous
;
"
and
this
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
all
the
whole
matter
.
"
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
so
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
<EOS>
I
thank
Heaven
no
bad
hath
happen
;
but
why
,
my
dear
,
will
you
ever
converse
with
that
madman
,
who
can
embrace
a
friend
one
moment
,
and
fight
with
him
the
next
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
dear
,
"
answer
Booth
,
"
you
yourself
must
confess
,
though
he
be
a
little
too
much
on
the
qui
vive
,
he
be
a
man
of
great
honour
and
good
-
nature
.
"
<EOS>
"
tell
me
not
,
"
reply
she
,
"
of
such
good
-
nature
and
honour
as
would
sacrifice
a
friend
and
a
whole
family
to
a
ridiculous
whim
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Heavens
!
"
cry
she
,
fall
upon
her
knee
,
"
from
what
misery
have
I
escape
,
from
what
have
these
poor
babe
escape
,
through
your
gracious
providence
this
day
!
"
<EOS>
then
turn
to
her
husband
,
she
cry
,
"
<EOS>
but
be
you
sure
the
monster
's
wound
be
no
more
dangerous
than
you
say
?
<EOS>
a
monster
surely
I
may
call
him
,
who
can
quarrel
with
a
man
that
could
not
,
that
I
be
convinced
would
not
,
offend
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
upon
this
question
,
Booth
repeat
the
assurance
which
the
surgeon
have
give
them
,
perhaps
with
a
little
enlargement
,
which
pretty
well
satisfy
Amelia
;
and
instead
of
blame
her
husband
for
what
he
have
do
,
she
tenderly
embrace
him
,
and
again
return
thank
to
Heaven
for
his
safety
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
Booth
insist
on
pay
a
short
visit
to
the
colonel
,
highly
against
the
inclination
of
Amelia
,
who
,
by
many
argument
and
entreaty
,
endeavour
to
dissuade
her
husband
from
continue
an
acquaintance
in
which
,
she
say
,
she
should
always
foresee
much
danger
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
be
at
last
prevail
upon
to
acquiesce
;
and
Booth
go
to
the
colonel
,
whose
lodging
happen
to
be
in
the
verge
as
well
as
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
He
find
the
colonel
in
his
night
-
gown
,
and
his
great
chair
,
engage
with
another
officer
at
a
game
of
chess
.
<EOS>
He
rise
immediately
,
and
,
have
heartily
embrace
Booth
,
present
him
to
his
friend
,
say
,
he
have
the
honour
to
introduce
to
him
as
brave
and
as
fortitudinous
a
man
as
any
in
the
king
's
dominion
.
<EOS>
He
then
take
Booth
with
him
into
the
next
room
,
and
desire
him
not
to
mention
a
word
of
what
have
happen
in
the
morning
;
say
,
"
I
be
very
well
satisfied
that
no
more
hath
happen
;
however
,
as
it
end
in
nothing
,
I
could
wish
it
may
remain
a
secret
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Booth
tell
him
he
be
heartily
glad
to
find
him
so
well
,
and
promise
never
to
mention
it
more
to
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
the
game
at
chess
being
<EOS>
but
just
begin
,
and
neither
of
the
party
have
gain
any
considerable
advantage
,
they
neither
of
them
insist
on
continue
it
;
and
now
the
colonel
's
antagonist
take
his
leave
and
leave
the
colonel
and
Booth
together
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
alone
,
the
latter
earnestly
entreat
the
former
to
acquaint
him
with
the
real
cause
of
his
anger
;
"
for
may
I
perish
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
if
I
can
even
guess
what
I
have
ever
do
to
offend
either
you
,
or
your
brother
.
<EOS>
Colonel
James
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Look'ee
,
child
,
"
cry
the
colonel
;
"
I
tell
you
I
be
for
my
own
part
satisfied
;
for
I
be
convinced
that
a
man
who
will
fight
can
never
be
a
rascal
;
and
,
therefore
,
why
should
you
enquire
any
more
of
me
at
present
?
<EOS>
when
I
see
my
brother
James
,
I
hope
to
reconcile
all
matter
,
and
perhaps
no
more
sword
nee
be
draw
on
this
occasion
.
"
<EOS>
but
Booth
still
persist
in
his
desire
,
the
colonel
,
after
some
hesitation
,
with
a
tremendous
oath
,
cry
out
,
"
I
do
not
think
myself
at
liberty
to
refuse
you
after
the
indignity
I
offer
you
;
so
,
since
you
demand
it
of
me
,
I
will
inform
you
.
<EOS>
My
brother
tell
me
you
have
use
him
dishonourably
,
and
have
divellicate
his
character
behind
his
back
.
<EOS>
He
give
me
his
word
,
too
,
that
he
be
well
assure
of
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
what
could
I
have
do
?
<EOS>
though
I
own
to
you
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
him
,
and
your
behaviour
since
hath
convince
me
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
right
;
I
must
either
have
give
him
the
lye
,
and
fight
with
him
,
or
else
I
be
oblige
to
behave
as
I
do
,
and
fight
with
you
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
lad
,
I
leave
it
to
you
to
do
as
you
please
;
but
,
if
you
be
lay
under
any
necessity
to
do
yourself
further
justice
,
it
be
your
own
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
colonel
,
"
answer
Booth
,
"
<EOS>
besides
the
obligation
I
have
to
the
colonel
,
I
have
really
so
much
love
for
him
,
that
I
think
of
nothing
less
than
resentment
.
<EOS>
all
I
wish
be
to
have
this
affair
bring
to
an
eclaircissement
,
and
to
satisfy
him
that
he
be
in
an
error
;
for
,
though
his
assertion
be
cruelly
injurious
,
and
I
have
never
deserve
them
,
yet
I
be
convinced
he
would
not
say
what
he
do
not
himself
think
.
<EOS>
some
rascal
,
envious
of
his
friendship
for
me
,
hath
belye
me
to
him
;
and
the
only
resentment
I
desire
be
,
to
convince
him
of
his
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
the
colonel
grin
horribly
a
ghastly
smile
,
or
rather
sneer
,
and
answer
,
"
Young
gentleman
,
you
may
do
as
you
please
;
but
,
by
the
eternal
dignity
of
man
,
if
any
man
breathing
have
take
a
liberty
with
my
character
 
here
,
here
 
Mr.
Booth
(
shew
his
finger
)
,
here
d####n
me
,
should
be
his
nostril
;
he
should
breathe
through
my
hand
,
and
breathe
his
last
,
d####n
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
answer
,
"
I
think
,
colonel
,
I
may
appeal
to
your
testimony
that
I
dare
do
myself
justice
;
since
he
who
dare
draw
his
sword
against
you
can
hardly
be
suppose
to
fear
any
other
person
;
but
I
repeat
to
you
again
that
I
love
Colonel
James
so
well
,
and
be
so
greatly
oblige
to
him
,
that
it
would
be
almost
indifferent
to
me
whether
I
direct
my
sword
against
his
breast
or
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
's
muscle
be
considerably
soften
by
Booth
's
last
speech
;
but
he
again
contract
them
into
a
vast
degree
of
fierceness
before
he
cry
out
 
<EOS>
"
Boy
,
thou
hast
reason
enough
to
be
vain
;
for
thou
art
the
first
person
that
ever
could
proudly
say
he
gain
an
advantage
over
me
in
combat
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
indeed
,
thou
art
not
afraid
of
any
man
breathe
,
and
,
as
I
know
thou
hast
some
obligation
to
my
brother
,
I
do
not
discommend
thee
;
for
nothing
more
become
the
dignity
of
a
man
than
gratitude
.
<EOS>
besides
,
as
I
be
satisfied
my
brother
can
produce
the
author
of
the
slander
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
be
satisfied
of
that
 
<EOS>
d####n
me
,
if
any
man
alive
dare
assert
the
contrary
;
for
that
would
be
to
make
my
brother
himself
a
liar
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
him
produce
his
author
;
and
then
,
my
dear
boy
,
your
do
yourself
proper
justice
there
will
bring
you
finely
out
of
the
whole
affair

<EOS>
as
soon
as
my
surgeon
give
me
leave
to
go
abroad
,
which
,
I
hope
,
will
be
in
a
few
day
<EOS>
,
I
will
bring
my
brother
James
to
a
tavern
where
you
shall
meet
us
;
and
I
will
engage
my
honour
,
my
whole
dignity
to
you
,
to
make
you
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
assurance
of
the
colonel
give
Booth
great
pleasure
;
for
few
person
ever
love
a
friend
better
than
he
do
James
;
and
as
for
do
military
justice
on
the
author
of
that
scandalous
report
which
have
incense
his
friend
against
him
,
not
Bath
himself
be
ever
more
ready
,
on
such
an
occasion
,
than
Booth
to
execute
it
.
<EOS>
He
soon
after
take
his
leave
,
and
return
home
in
high
spirit
to
his
Amelia
,
whom
he
find
in
Mrs.
Ellison
's
apartment
,
engage
in
a
party
at
ombre
with
that
lady
and
her
right
honourable
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
have
,
it
seem
,
have
a
second
interview
with
the
great
man
,
and
,
have
obtain
further
hope
(
for
I
think
there
be
not
yet
an
absolute
promise
)
of
success
in
Mr.
Booth
's
affair
,
<EOS>
his
usual
good
-
nature
bring
him
immediately
to
acquaint
Mr.
Booth
with
it
.
<EOS>
as
he
do
not
therefore
find
him
at
home
,
and
as
he
meet
with
the
two
lady
together
,
he
resolve
to
stay
till
his
friend
's
return
,
which
he
be
assure
would
not
be
long
,
especially
as
he
be
so
lucky
,
he
say
,
to
have
no
particular
engagement
that
whole
evening
.
  
<EOS>
We
remark
before
that
his
lordship
,
at
the
first
interview
with
Amelia
,
have
distinguish
her
by
a
more
particular
address
from
the
other
lady
;
but
that
now
appear
to
be
rather
owe
to
his
perfect
good
-
breeding
,
as
she
be
then
to
be
consider
as
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
than
from
any
other
preference
.
<EOS>
His
present
behaviour
make
this
still
more
manifest
;
for
,
as
he
be
now
in
Mrs.
Ellison
's
apartment
,
though
she
be
his
relation
and
an
old
acquaintance
,
he
apply
his
conversation
rather
more
to
her
than
to
Amelia
.
<EOS>
His
eye
,
indeed
,
be
now
and
then
guilty
of
the
contrary
distinction
,
but
this
be
only
by
stealth
;
for
they
constantly
withdraw
the
moment
they
be
discover
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
treat
Amelia
with
the
great
distance
,
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
most
profound
and
awful
respect
;
his
conversation
be
so
general
,
so
lively
,
and
so
obliging
,
that
Amelia
,
when
she
add
to
his
agreeableness
the
obligation
she
have
to
him
for
his
friendship
to
Booth
,
be
certainly
as
much
pleased
with
his
lordship
as
any
virtuous
woman
can
possibly
be
with
any
man
,
besides
her
own
husband
.
      
<EOS>
contain
various
matter
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
already
mention
the
good
-
humour
in
which
Booth
return
home
;
and
the
reader
will
easily
believe
it
be
not
a
little
encrease
by
the
good
-
humour
in
which
he
find
his
company
.
<EOS>
My
lord
receive
him
with
the
utmost
mark
of
friendship
and
affection
,
and
tell
him
that
his
affair
go
on
as
well
almost
as
he
himself
could
desire
,
and
that
he
doubt
not
very
soon
to
wish
him
joy
of
a
company
.
  
<EOS>
when
Booth
have
make
a
proper
return
to
all
his
lordship
's
unparalleled
goodness
,
he
whisper
Amelia
that
the
colonel
be
entirely
out
of
danger
,
and
almost
as
well
as
himself
.
<EOS>
this
make
her
satisfaction
complete
,
throw
her
into
such
spirit
,
and
give
such
a
lustre
to
her
eye
,
that
her
face
,
as
Horace
say
,
be
too
dazzling
to
be
look
at
;
it
be
certainly
too
handsome
to
be
look
at
without
the
high
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
depart
about
ten
o'clock
,
and
leave
the
company
in
rapture
with
him
,
especially
the
two
lady
,
of
whom
it
be
difficult
to
say
which
exceed
the
other
in
his
commendation
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
swear
she
believe
he
be
the
good
of
all
humankind
;
and
Amelia
,
without
make
any
exception
,
declare
he
be
the
fine
gentleman
and
most
agreeable
man
she
have
ever
see
in
her
life
;
add
,
it
be
great
pity
he
should
remain
single
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
indeed
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Ellison
,
"
and
I
have
often
lament
it
;
<EOS>
nay
,
I
be
astonish
at
it
,
consider
the
great
liking
he
always
shew
for
our
sex
,
and
he
may
certainly
have
the
choice
of
all
.
<EOS>
the
real
reason
,
I
believe
,
be
,
his
fondness
for
his
sister
's
child
.
<EOS>
I
declare
,
<EOS>
madam
,
if
you
be
to
see
his
behaviour
to
them
,
you
would
think
they
be
his
own
.
<EOS>
indeed
he
be
vastly
fond
of
all
manner
of
child
.
"
<EOS>
"
good
creature
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Amelia
;
"
if
ever
he
doth
me
the
honour
of
another
visit
I
be
resolve
I
will
shew
him
my
little
thing
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
Mrs.
Ellison
,
as
you
say
my
lord
love
child
,
I
may
say
,
without
vanity
,
he
will
not
see
many
such
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
will
he
not
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Ellison
:
"
and
now
I
think
on't
,
madam
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
at
my
own
stupidity
in
never
make
the
offer
before
;
but
since
you
put
it
into
my
head
,
if
you
will
give
me
leave
,
I
will
take
master
and
miss
to
wait
on
my
lord
's
nephew
and
niece
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
pretty
behaved
child
;
and
little
master
and
miss
will
be
,
I
dare
swear
,
very
happy
in
their
acquaintance
;
<EOS>
besides
,
if
my
lord
himself
should
see
them
,
I
know
what
will
happen
;
for
he
be
the
most
generous
of
all
human
being
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
very
readily
accept
the
favour
which
Mrs.
Ellison
offer
her
;
but
Booth
expr
some
reluctance
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
with
a
smile
,
"
this
behaviour
of
our
put
me
in
mind
of
the
common
conduct
of
beggar
;
who
,
whenever
they
receive
a
favour
,
be
sure
to
send
other
object
to
the
same
fountain
of
charity
.
<EOS>
do
not
we
,
my
dear
,
repay
our
obligation
to
my
lord
in
the
same
manner
,
by
send
our
child
a
begging
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
o
beastly
!
<EOS>
"
cry
Mrs.
Ellison
;
"
how
could
such
a
thought
enter
your
brain
?
<EOS>
I
protest
,
madam
<EOS>
,
I
begin
to
grow
ashamed
of
this
husband
of
yours
.
<EOS>
how
can
you
have
so
vulgar
a
way
of
thinking
?
<EOS>
beg
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
the
poor
little
dear
thing
a
begging
!
<EOS>
if
my
lord
be
capable
of
such
a
thought
,
though
he
be
my
own
brother
instead
of
my
cousin
,
I
should
scorn
him
too
much
ever
to
enter
his
door
.
"
<EOS>
"
o
dear
madam
!
"
answer
Amelia
,
"
you
take
Mr.
Booth
too
seriously
,
when
he
be
only
in
jest
;
and
the
child
shall
wait
upon
you
whenever
you
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
though
Booth
have
be
a
little
more
in
earnest
than
Amelia
have
represent
him
,
and
be
not
,
perhaps
,
quite
so
much
in
the
wrong
as
he
be
consider
by
Mrs.
Ellison
,
yet
,
<EOS>
see
there
be
two
to
one
against
him
,
he
wisely
think
proper
to
recede
,
and
let
his
simile
go
off
with
that
air
of
a
jest
which
his
wife
have
give
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
,
however
,
could
not
let
it
pass
without
pay
some
compliment
to
Amelia
's
understanding
,
nor
without
some
obscure
reflexion
upon
Booth
,
with
whom
she
be
more
offended
than
the
matter
require
.
<EOS>
She
be
indeed
a
woman
of
most
profuse
generosity
,
and
could
not
bear
a
thought
which
she
deem
vulgar
or
sneak
.
<EOS>
She
afterwards
launch
forth
the
most
profuse
encomium
of
his
lordship
's
liberality
,
and
conclude
the
evening
with
some
instance
which
he
have
give
of
that
virtue
which
,
if
not
the
noblest
,
be
,
perhaps
,
one
of
the
most
useful
to
society
with
which
great
and
rich
man
can
be
endow
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
early
,
serjeant
Atkinson
come
to
wait
on
lieutenant
Booth
,
and
desire
to
speak
with
his
honour
in
private
.
<EOS>
upon
which
the
lieutenant
and
serjeant
take
a
walk
together
in
the
Park
.
<EOS>
Booth
expect
every
minute
when
the
serjeant
would
open
his
mouth
;
under
which
expectation
he
continue
till
he
come
to
the
end
of
the
mall
,
and
so
he
may
have
continue
till
he
come
to
the
end
of
the
world
;
for
,
though
several
word
stand
at
the
end
of
the
serjeant
's
lip
,
there
they
be
likely
to
remain
for
ever
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
in
the
condition
of
a
miser
,
whom
a
charitable
impulse
hath
impel
to
draw
a
few
penny
to
the
edge
of
his
pocket
,
where
they
be
altogether
as
secure
as
if
they
be
in
the
bottom
;
for
,
as
the
one
hath
not
the
heart
to
part
with
a
farthing
,
so
neither
have
the
other
the
heart
to
speak
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
at
length
,
wonder
that
the
serjeant
do
not
speak
,
ask
him
,
what
his
business
be
?
<EOS>
when
the
latter
with
a
stammering
voice
begin
the
following
apology
:
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
your
honour
will
not
be
angry
,
nor
take
anything
amiss
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
,
it
be
not
of
my
seeking
,
nay
,
I
dare
not
proceed
in
the
matter
without
first
ask
your
leave
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
I
have
take
any
liberty
from
the
goodness
you
have
be
please
to
shew
me
,
I
should
look
upon
myself
as
one
of
the
most
worthless
and
despicable
of
wretch
;
but
nothing
be
farth
from
my
thought
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
distance
which
be
between
us
;
and
,
because
your
honour
hath
be
so
kind
and
good
<EOS>
as
to
treat
me
with
more
familiarity
than
any
other
officer
ever
do
,
if
I
have
be
base
enough
to
take
any
freedom
,
or
to
encroach
upon
your
honour
's
goodness
,
I
should
deserve
to
be
whipt
through
the
regiment
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
therefore
,
sir
,
you
will
not
suspect
me
of
any
such
attempt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
all
this
mean
,
Atkinson
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Booth
;
"
what
mighty
matter
would
you
introduce
with
all
this
previous
apology
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
almost
ashamed
and
afraid
to
mention
it
,
"
answer
the
serjeant
;
"
and
yet
I
be
sure
your
honour
will
believe
what
I
have
say
,
and
not
think
anything
owe
to
my
own
presumption
;
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
I
have
no
reason
to
think
you
would
do
anything
to
spoil
my
fortune
in
an
honest
way
,
when
it
be
dropt
into
my
lap
without
my
own
seeking
.
<EOS>
for
may
I
perish
if
it
be
not
all
the
lady
's
own
goodness
,
and
I
hope
in
Heaven
,
with
your
honour
's
leave
,
I
shall
live
to
make
her
amend
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
in
a
word
,
that
we
may
not
detain
the
reader
's
curiosity
quite
so
long
as
he
do
Booth
's
,
he
acquaint
that
gentleman
that
he
have
have
an
offer
of
marriage
from
a
lady
of
his
acquaintance
,
to
whose
company
he
have
introduce
him
,
and
desire
his
permission
to
accept
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
must
have
be
very
dull
indeed
<EOS>
if
,
after
what
the
serjeant
have
say
,
and
after
what
he
have
hear
Mrs.
Ellison
say
,
he
have
want
any
information
concern
the
lady
.
<EOS>
He
answer
him
briskly
and
chearfully
,
that
he
have
his
free
consent
to
marry
any
woman
whatever
;
"
and
the
great
and
richer
she
be
,
"
add
he
,
"
the
more
I
shall
be
pleased
with
the
match
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
enquire
who
the
lady
be
,
"
say
he
,
smile
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
she
will
make
as
good
a
wife
as
,
I
be
convinced
,
her
husband
will
deserve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
honour
hath
be
always
too
good
to
me
<EOS>

"
cry
Atkinson
;
"
but
<EOS>
this
I
promise
you
,
I
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
merit
the
kindness

pleased
to
shew
me

<EOS>
I
will
be
bold
to
say
she
will
marry
an
honest
man
,
though
he
be
but
a
poor
one
;
and
she
shall
never
want
anything
which
I
can
give
her
or
do
for
her
,
while
my
name
be
Joseph
Atkinson

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
so
her
name
be
a
secret
,
Joe
,
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Booth
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
serjeant
,
"
I
hope
your
honour
will
not
insist
upon
know
that
,
as
I
think
it
would
be
dishonourable
in
me
to
mention
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
"
reply
Booth
;
"
I
be
the
farth
in
the
world
from
any
such
desire

<EOS>
I
know
thee
better
than
to
imagine
thou
wouldst
disclose
the
name
of
a
fair
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Booth
then
shake
Atkinson
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
assure
him
earnestly
of
the
joy
he
have
in
his
good
fortune
;
for
which
the
good
serjeant
fail
not
of
make
all
proper
acknowledgment

<EOS>
after
which
they
part
,
and
Booth
return
home
.
  
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Ellison
open
the
door
,
Booth
hastily
rush
by
;
for
he
have
the
utmost
difficulty
to
prevent
laugh
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
He
run
directly
up
-
stair
,
and
,
throw
himself
into
a
chair
,
discharge
such
a
fit
of
laughter
as
greatly
surprize
,
and
at
first
almost
frightened
,
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
it
will
be
suppose
,
presently
enquire
into
the
cause
of
this
phenomenon
,
with
which
Booth
,
as
soon
as
he
be
able
(
for
that
be
not
within
a
few
minute
)
,
acquaint
her
.
<EOS>
the
news
do
not
affect
her
in
the
same
manner
it
have
affect
her
husband
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
she
cry
,
"
I
protest
I
can
not
guess
what
make
you
see
it
in
so
ridiculous
a
light
.
<EOS>
I
really
think
Mrs.
Ellison
hath
choose
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
be
convince
Joe
will
make
her
one
of
the
good
of
husband
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
that
be
the
great
blessing
a
woman
can
be
possess
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
however
,
when
Mrs.
Ellison
come
into
her
room
a
little
while
afterwards
to
fetch
the
child
,
Amelia
become
of
a
more
risible
disposition
,
especially
when
the
former
,
turn
to
Booth
,
who
be
then
present
,
say
,
"
so
,
captain
,
my
jantee
-
serjeant
be
very
early
here
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
scold
my
maid
heartily
for
let
him
wait
so
long
in
the
entry
like
a
lacquais
,
when
she
may
have
shew
him
into
my
inner
apartment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
Booth
burst
out
into
a
very
loud
laugh
;
and
Amelia
herself
could
no
more
prevent
laughing
than
she
could
blush
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heyday
!
<EOS>
"
cry
Mrs.
Ellison
;
"
what
have
I
say
to
cause
all
this
mirth
?
"
<EOS>
and
at
the
same
time
blush
,
and
look
very
silly
,
as
be
always
the
case
with
person
who
suspect
themselves
to
be
the
object
of
laughter
,
without
absolutely
take
what
it
be
which
make
them
ridiculous
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
still
continue
laugh
;
but
Amelia
,
compose
her
muscle
,
say
,
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
dear
Mrs.
Ellison
;
but
Mr.
Booth
hath
be
in
a
strange
giggling
humour
all
this
morning
;
and
I
really
think
it
be
infectious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
too
,
madam
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
but
one
be
sometimes
unaccountably
foolish
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
but
seriously
,
"
say
she
,
"
what
be
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
something
I
say
about
the
serjeant
,
I
believe
;
but
you
may
laugh
as
much
as
you
please
<EOS>
;
I
be
not
ashamed
of
own
<EOS>
I
think
him
one
of
the
prettiest
fellow
I
ever
see
in
my
life
;
and
,
I
own
,
I
scold
my
maid
at
suffer
him
to
wait
in
my
entry
;
and
where
be
the
mighty
ridiculous
matter
,
pray
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
none
at
all
,
"
answer
Booth
;
"
and
I
hope
the
next
time
he
will
be
usher
into
your
inner
apartment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
should
he
not
,
sir
?
"
reply
she
,
"
for
,
wherever
he
be
ushered
,
I
be
convinced
he
will
behave
himself
as
a
gentleman
should
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Amelia
put
an
end
to
the
discourse
,
or
it
may
have
proceed
to
very
great
length
;
for
Booth
be
of
a
waggish
inclination
,
and
Mrs.
Ellison
be
not
a
lady
of
the
nice
delicacy
.
     
<EOS>
the
heroic
behaviour
of
Colonel
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
go
this
morning
to
pay
a
second
visit
to
the
colonel
,
where
he
find
Colonel
James
.
<EOS>
both
the
colonel
and
the
lieutenant
appear
a
little
shocked
at
their
first
meeting
,
but
matter
be
soon
clear
up
;
for
the
former
presently
advanced
to
the
latter
,
shake
him
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
say
,
"
Mr.
Booth
,
I
be
ashamed
to
see
you
;
for
I
have
injure
you
,
and
I
heartily
ask
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
perfectly
convince
that
what
I
hint
to
my
brother
,
and
which
I
find
have
like
to
have
produce
such
fatal
consequence
,
be
entirely
groundless
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
be
content
with
my
ask
your
pardon
,
and
spare
me
the
disagreeable
remembrance
of
what
lead
me
into
my
error
,
I
shall
esteem
it
as
the
high
obligation
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
answer
,
"
as
to
what
regard
yourself
,
my
dear
colonel
,
I
be
abundantly
satisfied
;
but
,
as
I
be
convince
some
rascal
hath
be
my
enemy
with
you
in
the
cruell
manner
,
I
hope
you
will
not
deny
me
the
opportunity
of
kick
him
through
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
all
the
dignity
of
man
,
"
cry
Colonel
Bath
,
"
the
boy
speak
with
spirit
,
and
his
request
be
reasonable
.
"
  
<EOS>
Colonel
James
hesitate
a
moment
,
and
then
whisper
Booth
that
he
would
give
him
all
the
satisfaction
imaginable
concern
the
whole
affair
when
they
be
alone
together
;
upon
which
,
Booth
address
himself
to
Colonel
Bath
,
the
discourse
turn
on
other
matter
during
the
remainder
of
the
visit
,
which
be
but
short
,
and
then
both
go
away
together
,
leave
Colonel
Bath
as
well
as
it
be
possible
to
expect
,
more
to
the
satisfaction
of
Booth
than
of
Colonel
James
,
who
would
not
have
be
displease
if
his
wound
have
be
more
dangerous
;
for
he
be
grow
somewhat
weary
of
a
disposition
that
he
rather
call
captious
than
heroic
,
and
which
,
as
he
every
day
more
and
more
hate
his
wife
,
he
apprehend
may
<EOS>
some
time
or
other
give
him
some
trouble
;
for
Bath
be
the
most
affectionate
of
brother
,
and
have
often
swear
,
in
the
presence
of
James
,
that
he
would
eat
any
man
alive
who
should
use
his
sister
ill
.
  
<EOS>
Colonel
Bath
be
well
satisfied
that
his
brother
and
the
lieutenant
be
go
out
with
a
design
of
tilting
,
from
which
he
offer
not
a
syllable
to
dissuade
them
,
as
he
be
convince
it
be
right
,
and
that
Booth
could
not
in
honour
take
,
nor
the
colonel
give
,
any
less
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
when
they
have
be
go
therefore
about
half
an
hour
,
he
ring
his
bell
to
enquire
if
there
be
any
news
of
his
brother
;
a
question
which
he
repeat
every
ten
minute
for
the
space
of
two
hour
,
when
,
have
hear
nothing
of
him
,
he
begin
to
conclude
that
both
be
kill
on
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
while
he
be
in
this
state
of
anxiety
his
sister
come
to
see
him
;
for
,
notwithstanding
his
desire
of
keep
it
a
secret
,
the
duel
have
blaze
all
over
the
town
.
<EOS>
after
receive
some
kind
congratulation
on
his
safety
,
and
some
unkind
hint
concern
the
warmth
of
his
temper
,
the
colonel
ask
her
when
she
have
see
her
husband
?
<EOS>
she
answer
not
that
morning
.
<EOS>
He
then
communicate
to
her
his
suspicion
,
tell
her
he
be
convince
his
brother
have
draw
his
sword
that
day
,
and
that
,
as
neither
of
them
have
hear
anything
from
him
,
he
begin
to
apprehend
the
bad
that
could
happen
.
  
<EOS>
neither
Miss
Bellamy
nor
Mrs.
Gibber
be
ever
in
a
great
consternation
on
the
stage
than
now
appear
in
the
countenance
of
Mrs.
James
.
"
<EOS>
Good
Heavens
!
<EOS>
brother
,
"
cry
she
;
"
what
do
you
tell
me
?
<EOS>
you
have
frighten
me
to
death
.
<EOS>
let
your
man
get
me
a
glass
of
water
immediately
,
if
you
have
not
a
mind
to
see
me
die
before
your
face
.
<EOS>
when
,
where
,
how
be
this
quarrel
?
<EOS>
why
do
you
not
prevent
it
if
you
know
of
it
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
enough
to
be
every
day
torment
me
with
hazard
your
own
life
,
but
must
you
bring
the
life
of
one
who
you
know
must
be
,
and
ought
to
be
,
so
much
the
dear
of
all
to
me
,
into
danger
?
<EOS>
take
your
sword
,
brother
,
take
your
sword
,
and
plunge
it
into
my
bosom
;
it
would
be
kind
of
you
than
to
fill
it
with
such
dread
and
terror
.
<EOS>
"
here
she
swallow
the
glass
of
water
,
and
then
throw
herself
back
in
her
chair
,
as
if
she
have
intend
to
faint
away
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
,
if
she
have
so
,
the
colonel
would
have
lend
her
no
assistance
,
for
she
have
hurt
him
more
than
by
ten
thousand
stab
.
<EOS>
He
sit
erect
in
his
chair
,
with
his
eyebrow
knit
,
his
forehead
wrinkle
,
his
eye
flash
fire
,
his
tooth
grate
against
each
other
,
and
breathe
horrour
all
round
him
.
<EOS>
in
this
posture
he
sit
for
some
time
silent
,
cast
disdainful
look
at
his
sister
.
<EOS>
at
last
his
voice
find
its
way
through
a
passion
which
have
almost
choake
him
,
and
he
cry
out
,
"
sister
,
what
have
I
do
to
deserve
the
opinion
you
express
of
me
?
<EOS>
which
of
my
action
hath
make
you
conclude
that
I
be
a
rascal
and
a
coward
?
<EOS>
look
at
that
poor
sword
,
which
never
woman
yet
see
but
in
its
sheath
;
what
hath
that
do
to
merit
your
desire
that
it
should
be
contaminate
with
the
blood
of
a
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
brother
,
"
cry
she
,
"
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
you
say
;
you
be
desirous
,
I
believe
,
to
terrify
me
out
of
the
little
sense
I
have
leave
.
<EOS>
what
can
I
have
say
,
in
the
agony
of
grief
into
which
you
throw
me
,
to
deserve
this
passion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
answer
the
colonel
:
"
you
have
say
that
which
,
if
a
man
have
speak
,
nay
,
d####n
me
,
if
he
have
but
hint
that
he
durst
even
think
,
I
would
have
make
him
eat
my
sword
;
by
all
the
dignity
of
man
,
I
would
have
crumble
his
soul
into
powder
.
<EOS>
but
I
consider
that
the
word
be
speak
by
a
woman
,
and
I
be
calm
again
.
<EOS>
consider
,
my
dear
,
that
you
be
my
sister
,
and
behave
yourself
with
more
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
mention
to
you
my
surmise
.
<EOS>
It
may
not
have
happen
as
I
suspect
;
but
,
let
what
will
have
happen
,
you
will
have
the
comfort
that
your
husband
hath
behave
himself
with
become
dignity
,
and
lie
in
the
bed
of
honour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
talk
not
to
me
of
such
comfort
,
"
reply
the
lady
;
"
it
be
a
loss
I
can
not
survive
.
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
sit
here
lament
myself
?
<EOS>
I
will
go
this
instant
and
know
the
bad
of
my
fate
,
if
my
tremble
limb
will
carry
me
to
my
coach
.
<EOS>
good
morrow
,
dear
brother
;
whatever
become
of
me
,
I
be
glad
to
find
you
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
"
the
colonel
pay
her
his
proper
compliment
,
and
she
then
leave
the
room
,
but
return
instantly
back
,
say
,
"
brother
,
I
must
beg
the
favour
of
you
to
let
your
footman
step
to
my
mantua
-
maker
;
I
be
sure
it
be
a
miracle
,
in
my
present
distract
condition
,
how
it
come
into
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
the
footman
be
presently
summon
,
and
Mrs.
James
deliver
him
his
message
,
which
be
to
countermand
the
order
which
she
have
give
that
very
morning
to
make
her
up
a
new
suit
of
brocade
.
"
<EOS>
Heaven
know
,
"
say
she
,
"
now
when
I
can
wear
brocade
,
or
whether
ever
I
shall
wear
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
have
repeat
her
message
with
great
exactness
,
lest
there
should
be
any
mistake
,
she
again
lament
her
wretched
situation
,
and
then
depart
,
leave
the
colonel
in
full
expectation
of
hear
speedy
news
of
the
fatal
issue
of
the
battle
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
though
the
reader
should
entertain
the
same
curiosity
,
we
must
be
excuse
from
satisfy
it
till
we
have
first
account
for
an
incident
which
we
have
relate
in
this
very
chapter
,
and
which
,
we
think
,
deserve
some
solution
.
<EOS>
the
critic
,
I
be
convinced
,
already
be
apprize
that
I
mean
the
friendly
behaviour
of
James
to
Booth
,
which
,
from
what
we
have
before
record
,
seem
so
little
to
be
expect
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
remember
that
the
anger
which
the
former
of
these
gentleman
have
conceive
against
the
latter
arise
entirely
from
the
false
account
give
by
Miss
Matthews
of
Booth
,
whom
that
lady
have
accuse
to
Colonel
James
of
have
as
basely
as
wickedly
traduce
his
character
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
of
all
the
minister
of
vengeance
,
there
be
none
with
whom
the
devil
deal
so
treacherously
as
with
those
whom
he
employ
in
execute
the
mischievous
purpose
of
an
angry
mistress
;
for
no
sooner
be
revenge
execute
on
an
offending
lover
that
it
be
sure
to
be
repent
;
and
all
the
anger
which
before
rage
against
the
beloved
object
,
return
with
double
fury
on
the
head
of
his
assassin
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matthews
,
therefore
,
no
,
sooner
hear
that
Booth
be
kill
(
for
so
be
the
report
at
first
,
and
by
a
colonel
of
the
army
)
than
she
immediately
conclude
it
to
be
James
.
<EOS>
She
be
extremely
shocked
with
the
news
,
and
her
heart
instantly
begin
to
relent
.
<EOS>
all
the
reason
on
which
she
have
found
her
love
recur
,
in
the
strong
and
lively
colour
,
to
her
mind
,
and
all
the
cause
of
her
hatred
sink
down
and
disappear
;
or
,
if
the
least
remembrance
of
anything
which
have
disoblige
her
remain
,
her
heart
become
his
zealous
advocate
,
and
soon
satisfy
her
that
her
own
fate
be
more
to
be
blame
than
he
,
and
that
,
without
be
a
villain
,
he
could
have
act
no
otherwise
than
he
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
temper
of
mind
she
look
on
herself
as
the
murderer
of
an
innocent
man
,
and
,
what
to
her
be
much
bad
,
of
the
man
she
have
love
,
and
still
do
love
,
with
all
the
violence
imaginable
.
<EOS>
She
look
on
James
as
the
tool
with
which
she
have
do
this
murder
;
and
,
as
it
be
usual
for
people
who
have
rashly
or
inadvertently
make
any
animate
or
inanimate
thing
the
instrument
of
mischief
to
hate
the
innocent
mean
by
which
the
mischief
be
effect
<EOS>
(
for
this
be
a
subtle
method
which
the
mind
invent
to
excuse
ourselves
,
the
last
object
on
whom
we
would
willingly
wreak
our
vengeance
)
,
so
Miss
Matthews
now
hate
and
curse
James
as
the
efficient
cause
of
that
act
which
she
herself
have
contrive
and
labour
to
carry
into
execution
.
  
<EOS>
She
sit
down
therefore
in
a
furious
agitation
,
little
short
of
madness
,
and
write
the
following
letter
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
this
will
find
you
in
the
hand
of
justice
,
for
the
murder
of
one
of
the
good
friend
that
ever
man
be
bless
with
.
<EOS>
in
one
sense
,
indeed
,
he
may
seem
to
have
deserve
his
fate
,
by
chuse
a
fool
for
a
friend
;
for
who
but
a
fool
would
have
believe
what
the
anger
and
rage
of
an
injure
woman
suggest
;
a
story
so

<EOS>
We
shall
now
return
to
Colonel
James
and
Mr.
Booth
,
who
walk
together
from
Colonel
Bath
's
lodging
with
much
more
peaceable
intention
than
that
gentleman
have
conjecture
,
who
dreamt
of
nothing
but
sword
and
gun
and
implement
of
war
.
  
<EOS>
the
birdcage
-
walk
in
the
Park
be
the
scene
appoint
by
James
for
unburthene
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Thither
they
come
,
and
there
James
acquaint
Booth
with
all
that
which
the
reader
know
already
,
and
give
him
the
letter
which
we
have
insert
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
exprest
great
astonishment
at
this
relation
,
not
without
vent
some
detestation
of
the
wickedness
of
Miss
Matthews
;
upon
which
James
take
him
up
,
say
,
he
ought
not
to
speak
with
such
abhorrence
of
fault
which
love
for
him
have
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
mention
love
,
my
dear
colonel
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
and
such
a
woman
in
the
same
breath
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
faith
!
<EOS>
can
I
,
"
say
James
;
"
for
the
devil
take
me
if
I
know
a
more
lovely
woman
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
he
begin
to
describe
her
whole
person
;
but
,
as
we
can
not
insert
all
the
description
,
so
we
shall
omit
it
all
;
and
conclude
with
say
,
"
curse
me
if
I
do
not
think
her
the
fine
creature
in
the
universe
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
half
my
estate
,
Booth
<EOS>
,
she
love
me
as
well
as
she
doth
you
.
<EOS>
though
,
on
second
consideration
,
I
believe
I
should
repent
that
bargain
;
for
then
,
very
possibly
,
I
should
not
care
a
farthing
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
pardon
me
,
dear
colonel
,
"
answer
Booth
;
"
but
to
me
there
appear
somewhat
very
singular
in
your
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
beauty
be
indeed
the
object
of
like
,
great
quality
of
admiration
,
good
one
of
esteem
;
but
the
devil
take
me
if
I
think
anything
but
love
to
be
the
object
of
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
not
something
too
selfish
,
"
reply
James
,
"
in
that
opinion
?
<EOS>
but
,
without
consider
it
in
that
light
,
be
it
not
of
all
thing
the
most
insipid
?
<EOS>
all
oil
!
<EOS>
all
sugar
!
<EOS>
zounds
!
<EOS>
it
be
enough
to
cloy
the
sharp
-
set
appetite
of
a
parson
.
<EOS>
acid
surely
be
the
most
likely
to
quicken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
love
reasoning
in
allegory
,
"
cry
Booth
;
"
but
with
regard
to
love
,
I
declare
I
never
find
anything
cloy
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
live
almost
alone
with
my
wife
near
three
year
together
,
be
never
tired
with
her
company
,
nor
ever
wish
for
any
other
;
and
I
be
sure
I
never
taste
any
of
the
acid
<EOS>
you
mention
to
quicken
my
appetite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
all
very
extraordinary
and
romantic
to
me
,
"
answer
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
to
be
shut
up
three
year
with
the
same
woman
,
which
Heaven
forbid
!
<EOS>
nothing
,
I
think
,
could
keep
me
alive
but
a
temper
as
violent
as
that
of
Miss
Matthews
.
<EOS>
as
to
love
,
it
would
make
me
sick
to
death
in
the
twentieth
part
of
that
time
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
so
condemn
,
let
me
see
,
what
would
I
wish
the
woman
to
be
?
<EOS>
I
think
no
one
virtue
would
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
with
the
spirit
of
a
tigress
I
would
have
her
be
a
prude
,
a
scold
,
a
scholar
,
a
critic
,
a
wit
,
a
politician
,
and
a
Jacobite
;
and
then
,
perhaps
,
eternal
opposition
would
keep
up
our
spirit
;
and
,
wish
one
another
daily
at
the
devil
,
we
should
make
a
shift
to
drag
on
a
damnable
state
of
life
,
without
much
spleen
or
vapour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
do
not
intend
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
to
break
with
this
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
more
than
I
have
already
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
"
answer
the
colonel
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
be
reconcile
to
her
?
"
say
Booth
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
faith
!
<EOS>
will
I
,
if
I
can
,
"
answer
the
colonel
;
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
no
objection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
none
,
my

friend

"

Booth
,
"
unless
on
your
account

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe
you
,
"
say
the
colonel
:
"
and
yet
,
let
me
tell
you
,
you
be
a
very
extraordinary
man
,
not
to
desire
me
to
quit
her
on
your
own
account
.
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
,
I
begin
to
pity
the
woman
,
who
hath
place
her
affection
,
perhaps
,
on
the
only
man
in
England
of
your
age
who
would
not
return
it
.
<EOS>
but
for
my
part
,
I
promise
you
,
I
like
her
beyond
all
other
woman
;
and
,
whilst
that
be
the
case
,
my
boy
,
if
her
mind
be
as
full
of
iniquity
as
Pandora
's
box
be
of
disease
,
I
would
hug
her
close
in
my
arm
,
and
only
take
as
much
care
as
possible
to
keep
the
lid
down
for
fear
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
but
come
,
dear
Booth
,
"
say
he
,
"
let
us
consider
your
affair
;
for
I
be
ashamed
of
have
neglect
them
so
long
;
and
the
only
anger
I
have
against
this
wench
be
,
that
she
be
the
occasion
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
then
acquaint
the
colonel
with
the
promise
he
have
receive
from
the
noble
lord
,
upon
which
James
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
and
heartily
wish
him
joy
,
cry
,
"
I
do
assure
you
,
if
you
have
his
interest
,
you
will
need
no
other
;
I
do
not
know
you
be
acquaint
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
which
Mr.
Booth
answer
,
"
that
he
be
but
a
new
acquaintance
,
and
that
he
be
recommend
to
him
by
a
lady
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
lady
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
colonel
;
"
well
,
I
do
not
ask
her
name
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
happy
man
,
Booth
,
amongst
the
woman
;
and
,
I
assure
you
,
you
could
have
no
strong
recommendation
.
<EOS>
the
peer
love
the
lady
,
I
believe
,
as
well
as
ever
Mark
Antony
do
;
and
it
be
not
his
fault
if
he
hath
not
spend
as
much
upon
them
.
<EOS>
if
he
once
fix
his
eye
upon
a
woman
,
he
will
stick
at
nothing
to
get
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
indeed
!
"
cry
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
be
that
his
character
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
faith
,
"
answer
the
colonel
,
"
and
the
character
of
most
man
besides
him
.
<EOS>
few
of
them
,
I
mean
,
will
stick
at
anything
beside
their
money
.
<EOS>
Jusque
<EOS>
a
la
Bourse
be
sometimes
the
boundary
of
love
as
well
as
friendship
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
I
never
know
any
other
man
part
with
his
money
so
very
freely
on
these
occasion
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
dear
Booth
,
the
confidence
I
have
in
your
honour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
you
have
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
see
what
instance
you
now
give
me
of
that
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
have
not
I
shew
you
,
"
answer
James
,
"
where
you
may
carry
your
good
to
market
?
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
,
my
friend
,
that
be
a
secret
I
would
not
impart
to
every
man
in
your
situation
,
and
all
circumstance
consider
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
,
sir
,
"
cry
Booth
very
gravely
,
and
turn
as
pale
as
death
,
"
you
should
entertain
a
thought
of
this
kind
;
a
thought
which
hath
almost
freeze
up
my
blood
.
<EOS>
I
be
unwilling
to
believe
there
be
such
villain
in
the
world
;
but
there
be
none
of
them
whom
I
should
detest
half
so
much
as
myself
,
if
my
own
mind
have
ever
suggest
to
me
a
hint
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
I
have
taste
of
some
distress
of
life
,
and
I
know
not
to
what
great
<EOS>
I
may
be
drive
,
but
my
honour
,
I
thank
Heaven
,
be
in
my
own
power
,
and
<EOS>
I
can
boldly
say
to
Fortune
she
shall
not
rob
me
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
I
not
expr
that
confidence
,
my
dear
Booth
?
"
answer
the
colonel
.
"
<EOS>
and
what
you
say
now
well
justify
my
opinion
;
for
I
do
agree
with
you
that
,
consider
all
thing
,
it
would
be
the
high
instance
of
dishonour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dishonour
,
indeed
!
"
return
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
to
prostitute
my
wife
!
<EOS>
Can
I
think
there
be
such
a
wretch
breathe
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
,
"
say
the
colonel
,
"
but
I
be
sure
it
be
very
far
from
my
intention
to
insinuate
the
least
hint
of
any
such
matter
to
you
.
<EOS>
nor
can
I
imagine
how
you
yourself
could
conceive
such
a
thought
.
<EOS>
the
good
I
mean
be
no
other
than
the
charming
person
of
Miss
Matthews
,
for
whom
I
be
convince
my
lord
would
bid
a
swinging
price
against
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
's
countenance
greatly
clear
up
at
this
declaration
,
and
he
answer
with
a
smile
,
that
he
hope
he
nee
not
give
the
colonel
any
assurance
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
however
,
though
he
be
satisfied
with
regard
to
the
colonel
's
suspicion
,
yet
some
chimera
now
arise
in
his
brain
which
give
him
no
very
agreeable
sensation
.
<EOS>
what
these
be
,
the
sagacious
reader
may
probably
suspect
;
but
,
if
he
should
not
,
we
may
perhaps
have
occasion
to
open
them
in
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
here
we
will
put
an
end
to
this
dialogue

and
to

fifth
book

BOOK
VI

<EOS>
panegyric
on
beauty
,
with
other
grave
matter

<EOS>
the
colonel
and
Booth
walk
together
to
the
latter
's
lodging
,
for
as
it
be
not
that
day
in
the
week
in
which
all
part
of
the
town
be
indifferent
<EOS>
,
Booth
could
not
wait
on
the
colonel
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
in
spring
-
garden
,
Booth
,
to
his
great
surprize
,
find
no
one
at
home
but
the
maid
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
Amelia
have
accompany
Mrs.
Ellison
and
her
child
to
his
lordship
's
;

as
her
little
girl
show
a
great
unwillingness
to
go
without
her
,
the
fond
mother
be
easily
persuade
to
make
one
of
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
have
scarce
usher
the
colonel
up
to
his
apartment
when
a
servant
from
Mrs.
James
knock
hastily
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
lady
,
not
meet
with
her
husband
at
her
return
home
,
begin
to
despair
of
him
,
and
perform
everything
which
be
decent
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
an
apothecary
be
presently
call
with
hartshorn
and
sal
volatile
,
a
doctor
be
send
for
,
and
messenger
be
despatch
every
way
;
amongst
the
rest
,
one
be
send
to
enquire
at
the
lodging
of
his
suppose
antagonist
.
  
<EOS>
the
servant
hearing
that
his
master
be
alive
and
well
above
-
stair
,
run
up
eagerly
to
acquaint
him
with
the
dreadful
situation
in
which
he
leave
his
miserable
lady
at
home
,
and
likewise
with
the
occasion
of
all
her
distress
,
say
,
that
his
lady
have
be
at
her
brother
's
,
and
have
there
hear
that
his
honour
be
kill
in
a
duel
by
Captain
Booth
.
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
smile
at
this
account
,
and
bid
the
servant
make
haste
back
to
contradict
it
.
<EOS>
and
then
turn
to
Booth
,
he
say
,
"
be
there
ever
such
another
fellow
as
this
brother
of
mine
?
<EOS>
I
think
indeed
,
his
behaviour
be
somewhat
odd
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
overhear
me
whisper
that
I
would
give
you
satisfaction
,
and
thence
conclude
we
go
together
with
a
design
of
tilting
.
<EOS>
d####n
<EOS>
the
fellow
,
I
begin
to
grow
heartily
sick
of
him
,
and
wish
I
could
get
well
rid
of
him
without
cut
his
throat
,
which
I
sometimes
apprehend
he
will
insist
on
my
doing
,
as
a
return
for
my
get
him
make
a
lieutenant-
colonel

<EOS>
whilst

on
the

Amelia

Grace

her

,
Heaven
in
her
eye
,
     
<EOS>
in
every
gesture
,
dignity
and
love

<EOS>
or
,
as
Waller
sweetly
,
though
less
sublimely
sing
:
         
Sweetness
,
truth

and
every
grace

which
time

<EOS>
the
eye
may
in
a
moment
reach
,
     
and
read
distinctly
in
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
or
,
to
mention
one
poet
more
,
and
him
of
all
the
sweetest
,
she
seem
to
be
the
very
person
of
whom
suckle
write
the
follow
line
,
where
,
speak
of
Cupid
,
he
say
,
       
all
his
lovely
look
,
his
pleasing
fire

all
his
sweet
motion

all
his
take

<EOS>
all
that
awake

all
that
inflame

all
that
sweetly
command
,
all
that
beguile

He
do
into
one
pair
of
eye
convey
,
       
<EOS>
and
there
beg
leave
that
he
himself
may
stay
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
Amelia
at
this
time
when
she
enter
the
room
;
and
,
have
pay
her
respect
to
the
colonel
<EOS>
,
she
go
up
to
her
husband
,
and
cry
,
"
o
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
never
be
any
creature
so
happy
as
your
little
thing
have
be
this
whole
morning
;
and
all
owe
to
my
lord
's
goodness
;
sure
never
be
anything
so
good
-
natured
and
so
generous
!
"
<EOS>
She
then
make
the
child
produce
their
present
,
the
value
of
which
amount
to
a
pretty
large
sum
;
for
there
be
a
gold
watch
,
amongst
the
trinket
,
that
cost
above
twenty
guinea
.
  
<EOS>
instead
of
discover
so
much
satisfaction
on
this
occasion
as
Amelia
expect
,
Booth
very
gravely
answer
,
"
and
pray
,
my
dear
,
how
be
we
to
repay
all
these
obligation
to
his
lordship
?
"
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
ask
so
strange
a
question
?
<EOS>
"
cry
Mrs.
Ellison
:
"
<EOS>
how
little
do
you
know
of
the
soul
of
generosity
(
for
sure
my
cousin
deserve
that
name
)
when
you
call
a
few
little
trinket
give
to
child
an
obligation
!
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
my
dear
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
I
would
have
stop
his
hand
if
it
have
be
possible
;
nay
,
I
be
force
at
last
absolutely
to
refuse
,
or
I
believe
he
would
have
lay
a
hundred
pound
out
on
the
child
;
for
I
never
see
any
one
so
fond
of
child
,
which
convince
me
he
be
one
of
the
good
of
man
;
but
I
ask
your
pardon
,
colonel
,
"
say
she
,
turn
to
him
;
"
I
should
not
entertain
you
with
these
subject
;
yet
I
know
you
have
goodness
enough
to
excuse
the
folly
of
a
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
make
a
very
low
assent
bow
,
and
soon
after
they
all
sit
down
to
a
small
repast
;
for
the
colonel
have
promise
Booth
to
dine
with
him
when
they
first
come
home
together
,
and
what
he
have
since
hear
from
his
own
house
<EOS>
give
him
still
less
inclination
than
ever
to
repair
thither
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
besides
both
these
,
there
be
a
third
and
strong
inducement
to
him
to
pass
the
day
with
his
friend
,
and
this
be
the
desire
of
pass
it
with
his
friend
's
wife
.
<EOS>
when
the
colonel
have
first
see
Amelia
in
France
,
she
be
but
just
recover
from
a
consumptive
habit
,
and
look
pale
and
thin
;
besides
,
his
engagement
with
Miss
Bath
at
that
time
take
total
possession
of
him
,
and
guard
his
heart
from
the
impression
of
another
woman
;
and
,
when
he
have
dine
with
her
in
town
,
the
vexation
through
which
she
have
lately
pass
have
somewhat
deaden
her
beauty
;
besides
,
he
be
then
engage
,
as
we
have
see
,
in
a
very
warm
pursuit
of
a
new
mistress
,
but
now
he
have
no
such
impediment
;
for
,
though
the
reader
hath
just
before
see
his
warm
declaration
of
a
passion
for
Miss
Matthews
,
yet
it
may
be
remember
that
he
have
be
in
possession
of
her
for
above
a
fortnight
;
and
one
of
the
happy
property
of
this
kind
of
passion
be
,
that
it
can
with
equal
violence
love
half
a
dozen
or
half
a
score
different
object
at
one
and
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
but
indeed
such
be
the
charm
now
display
by
Amelia
,
of
which
we
endeavour
above
to
draw
some
faint
resemblance
,
that
perhaps
no
other
beauty
could
have
secure
him
from
their
influence
;
and
here
,
to
confess
a
truth
in
his
favour
,
however
the
grave
or
rather
the
hypocritical
part
of
mankind
may
censure
it
<EOS>
,
I
be
firmly
persuade
that
to
withdraw
admiration
from
exquisite
beauty
,
or
to
feel
no
delight
in
gaze
at
it
,
be
as
impossible
as
to
feel
no
warmth
from
the
most
scorching
ray
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
to
run
away
be
all
that
be
in
our
power
;
and
in
the
former
case
,
if
it
must
be
allow
we
have
the
power
of
run
away
,
it
must
be
allow
also
that
it
require
the
strong
resolution
to
execute
it
;
for
when
,
as
Dryden
say
,
                
all
paradise
be
open'd
in
a
face
,
  
<EOS>
how
natural
be
the
desire
of
go
thither
!
<EOS>
and
how
difficult
to
quit
the
lovely
prospect
!
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
however
difficult
this
may
be
,
my
young
reader
,
it
be
absolutely
necessary
,
and
that
immediately
too
:
flat
not
yourself
that
fire
will
not
scorch
as
well
as
warm
,
and
the
longer
we
stay
within
its
reach
the
more
we
shall
burn
.
<EOS>
the
admiration
of
a
beautiful
woman
,
though
the
wife
of
our
dear
friend
,
may
at
first
perhaps
be
innocent
,
but
let
us
not
flatter
ourselves
it
will
always
remain
so
;
desire
be
sure
to
succeed
;
and
wish
,
hope
,
design
,
with
a
long
train
of
mischief
,
tread
close
at
our
heel
.
<EOS>
in
affair
of
this
kind
we
may
most
properly
apply
the
well
-
know
remark
of
nemo
repente
fuit
turpissimus
.
<EOS>
It
fare
,
indeed
,
with
us
on
this
occasion
as
with
the
unwary
traveller
in
some
part
of
Arabia
<EOS>
the
desert
,
whom
the
treacherous
sand
imperceptibly
betray
till
he
be
overwhelmed
and
lose
.
<EOS>
in
both
case
the
only
safety
be
by
withdraw
our
foot
the
very
first
moment
we
perceive
them
slide
.
  
<EOS>
this
digression
may
appear
impertinent
to
some
reader
;
we
could
not
,
however
,
avoid
the
opportunity
of
offer
the
above
hint
;
since
of
all
passion
there
be
none
against
which
we
should
so
strongly
fortify
ourselves
as
this
,
which
be
generally
call
love
;
for
no
other
lay
before
us
,
especially
in
the
tumultuous
day
of
youth
,
such
sweet
,
such
strong
and
almost
irresistible
temptation
;
none
hath
produce
in
private
life
such
fatal
and
lamentable
tragedy
;
and
what
be
bad
of
all
,
there
be
none
to
whose
poison
and
infatuation
the
good
of
mind
be
so
liable
.
<EOS>
ambition
scarce
ever
produce
any
evil
but
when
it
reign
in
cruel
and
savage
bosom
;
and
avarice
seldom
flourish
at
all
but
in
the
base
and
poor
soil
.
<EOS>
love
,
on
the
contrary
,
sprout
usually
up
in
the
rich
and
noblest
mind
;
but
there
,
unless
nicely
watch
,
prune
,
and
cultivate
,
and
carefully
keep
clear
of
those
vicious
weed
which
be
too
apt
to
surround
it
,
it
branch
forth
into
wildness
and
disorder
,
produce
nothing
desirable
,
but
choak
up
and
kill
whatever
be
good
and
noble
in
the
mind
where
it
so
abound
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
to
drop
the
allegory
,
not
only
tenderness
and
good
nature
,
but
bravery
,
generosity
,
and
every
virtue
be
often
make
the
instrument
of
effect
the
most
atrocious
purpose
of
this
all
-
subdue
tyrant
.
    
<EOS>
which
will
not
appear
,
we
presume
,
unnatural
to
all
married
reader
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
table
of
poor
Booth
afford
but
an
indifferent
repast
to
the
colonel
's
hunger
,
here
be
most
excellent
entertainment
of
a
much
high
kind
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
begin
now
to
wonder
within
himself
at
his
not
have
before
discover
such
incomparable
beauty
and
excellence
.
<EOS>
this
wonder
be
indeed
so
natural
that
,
lest
it
should
arise
likewise
in
the
reader
,
we
think
proper
to
give
the
solution
of
it
in
the
precede
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
first
two
hour
<EOS>
the
colonel
scarce
ever
have
his
eye
off
from
Amelia
;
for
he
be
take
by
surprize
,
and
his
heart
be
go
before
he
suspect
himself
to
be
in
any
danger
.
<EOS>
His
mind
,
however
,
no
sooner
suggest
a
certain
secret
to
him
than
it
suggest
some
degree
of
prudence
to
him
at
the
same
time
;
and
the
knowledge
that
he
have
thought
to
conceal
,
and
the
care
of
conceal
them
,
have
birth
at
one
and
the
same
instant
.
<EOS>
during
the
residue
of
the
day
,
therefore
,
he
grow
more
circumspect
,
and
content
himself
with
now
and
then
steal
a
look
by
chance
,
especially
as
the
more
than
ordinary
gravity
of
Booth
make
him
fear
that
his
former
behaviour
have
betray
to
Booth
's
observation
the
great
and
sudden
liking
he
have
conceive
for
his
wife
,
even
before
he
have
observe
it
in
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
continue
the
whole
day
in
the
high
spirit
and
high
good
humour
imaginable
,
never
once
remark
that
appearance
of
discontent
in
her
husband
of
which
the
colonel
have
take
notice
;
so
much
more
quick
-
sighted
,
as
we
have
somewhere
else
hint
,
be
guilt
than
innocence
.
<EOS>
whether
Booth
have
in
reality
make
any
such
observation
on
the
colonel
's
behaviour
as
he
have
suspect
,
we
will
not
undertake
to
determine
;
yet
so
far
may
be
material
to
say
,
as
we
can
with
sufficient
certainty
,
that
the
change
in
Booth
's
behaviour
that
day
,
from
what
be
usual
with
him
,
be
remarkable
enough
.
<EOS>
none
of
his
former
vivacity
appear
in
his
conversation
;
and
his
countenance
be
alter
from
be
the
picture
of
sweetness
and
good
humour
,
not
indeed
to
sourness
or
moroseness
,
but
to
gravity
and
melancholy
.
  
<EOS>
though
the
colonel
's
suspicion
have
the
effect
which
we
have
mention
on
his
behaviour
,
yet
it
could
not
persuade
him
to
depart
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
sit
in
his
chair
as
if
confine
to
it
by
enchantment
,
steal
look
now
and
then
,
and
humour
his
grow
passion
,
without
have
command
enough
over
his
limb
to
carry
him
out
of
the
room
,
till
decency
at
last
<EOS>
force
him
to
put
an
end
to
his
preposterous
visit
.
<EOS>
when
the
husband
and
wife
be
leave
alone
together
,
the
latter
resume
the
subject
of
her
child
,
and
give
Booth
a
particular
narrative
of
all
that
have
pass
at
his
lordship
's
,
which
he
,
though
something
have
certainly
disconcert
him
,
affect
to
receive
with
all
the
pleasure
he
could
;
and
this
affectation
,
however
aukwardly
he
act
his
part
,
pass
very
well
on
Amelia
;
for
she
could
not
well
conceive
a
displeasure
of
which
she
have
not
the
least
hint
of
any
cause
,
and
indeed
at
a
time
when
,
from
his
reconciliation
with
James
,
she
imagine
her
husband
to
be
entirely
and
perfectly
happy
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
that
night
Booth
past
awake
;
and
,
if
during
the
residue
he
may
be
say
to
sleep
,
he
could
scarce
be
say
to
enjoy
repose
;
his
eye
be
no
sooner
closed
,
that
he
be
pursue
and
haunt
by
the
most
frightful
and
terrifying
dream
,
which
throw
him
into
so
restless
a
condition
,
that
he
soon
disturb
his
Amelia
,
and
greatly
alarm
her
with
apprehension
that
he
have
be
seize
by
some
dreadful
disease
,
though
he
have
not
the
least
symptom
of
a
fever
by
any
extraordinary
heat
,
or
any
other
indication
,
but
be
rather
cold
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
as
Booth
assure
his
wife
that
he
be
very
well
,
but
find
no
inclination
to
sleep
,
she
likewise
bid
adieu
to
her
slumber
,
and
attempt
to
entertain
him
with
her
conversation
.
<EOS>
upon
which
his
lordship
occur
as
the
first
topic
;
and
she
repeat
to
him
all
the
story
which
she
have
hear
from
Mrs.
Ellison
,
of
the
peer
's
goodness
to
his
sister
and
his
nephew
and
niece
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
to
describe
their
fondness
for
their
uncle
,
which
be
to
me
an
incontestible
sign
of
a
parent
's
goodness
.
<EOS>
"
in
this
manner
she
run
on
for
several
minute
,
conclude
at
last
,
that
it
be
pity
so
very
few
<EOS>
have
such
generous
mind
join
to
immense
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
,
instead
of
make
a
direct
answer
to
what
Amelia
have
say
,
cry
coldly
,
"
but
do
you
think
,
my
dear
,
it
be
right
to
accept
all
those
expensive
toy
which
the
child
bring
home
?
<EOS>
and
I
ask
you
again
,
what
return
we
be
to
make
for
these
obligation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
my
dear
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
you
see
this
matter
in
too
serious
a
light
.
<EOS>
though
I
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
who
would
lessen
his
lordship
's
goodness
(
indeed
I
shall
always
think
we
be
both
infinitely
oblige
to
him
)
,
yet
sure
you
must
allow
the
expense
to
be
a
mere
trifle
to
such
a
vast
fortune
.
<EOS>
as
for
return
,
his
own
benevolence
,
in
the
satisfaction
it
receive
,
more
than
repay
itself
,
and
I
be
convince
he
expect
no
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
my
dear
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
you
shall
have
it
your
way
;
I
must
confess
I
never
yet
find
any
reason
to
blame
your
discernment
;
and
perhaps
I
have
be
in
the
wrong
to
give
myself
so
much
uneasiness
on
this
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
uneasiness
,
child
!
"
say
Amelia
eagerly
;
"
Good
Heavens
!
<EOS>
hath
<EOS>
this
make
you
uneasy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
own
it
hath
,
"
answer
Booth
,
"
and
<EOS>
it
hath
be
the
only
cause
of
break
my
repose

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
then
I

cry
Amelia

"
<EOS>
all
the
thing
have
be
at
the
devil
before
ever
the
child
have
see
them
;
and
,
whatever
I
may
think
myself

I
promise
you

never

the
value
of
a
farthing
:
 
if
upon
this
occasion
I
have
be
the
cause
of
your
uneasiness
,
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
that
I
be
totally
innocent
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
those
word
Booth
catch
her
in
his
arm
,
and
with
the
tender
embrace
,
emphatically
repeat
the
word
innocent
,
cry
,
"
Heaven
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
think
otherwise
!
<EOS>
oh
,
thou
art
the
good
of
creature
that
ever
bless
a
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
but
,
"
say
she
,
smile
,
"
do
confess
,
my
dear
,
the
truth
<EOS>
;
I
promise
you
I
will
not
blame
you
nor
disesteem
you
for
it
;
but
be
not
pride
really
at
the
bottom
of
this
fear
of
an
obligation
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
may
,
"
answer
he
;
"
or
,
if
you
will
,
you
may
call
it
fear
.
<EOS>
I
own
I
be
afraid
of
obligation
,
as
the
bad
kind
of
debt
;
for
I
have
generally
observe
those
who
confer
them
expect
to
be
repay
ten
thousand
-
fold
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
end
all
that
be
material
of
their
discourse
;
and
a
little
time
afterwards
,
they
both
fall
fast
asleep
in
one
another
's
arm
;
from
which
time
Booth
have
no
more
restlessness
,
nor
any
further
perturbation
in
his
dream
.
  
<EOS>
Their
repose
,
however
,
have
be
so
much
disturb
in
the
former
part
of
the
night
,
that
,
as
it
be
very
late
before
they
enjoy
that
sweet
sleep
<EOS>
I
have
just
mention
,
they
lie
abe
the
next
day
till
noon
,
when
they
both
rise
with
the
utmost
chearfulness
;
and
,
while
Amelia
bestir
herself
in
the
affair
of
her
family
,
Booth
go
to
visit
the
wounded
colonel
.
  
<EOS>
He
find
that
gentleman
still
proceed
very
fast
in
his
recovery
,
with
which
he
be
more
pleased
than
he
have
reason
to
be
with
his
reception
;
for
the
colonel
receive
him
very
coldly
indeed
,
and
,
when
Booth
tell
him
he
have
receive
perfect
satisfaction
from
his
brother
,
Bath
erect
his
head
and
answer
with
a
sneer
,
"
very
well
,
sir
,
if
you
think
these
matter
can
be
so
make
up
,
d####n
me
if
it
be
any
business
of
mine
.
<EOS>
My
dignity
hath
not
be
injure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
one
,
I
believe
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
dare
injure
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
believe
so
!
"
say
the
colonel
:
"
I
think
,
sir
,
you
may
be
assure
of
it
;
but
this
,
at
least
,
you
may
be
assure
of
,
that
if
any
man
do
,
I
would
tumble
him
down
the
precipice
of
hell
,
d####n
me
,
that
you
may
be
assure
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
Booth
find
the
colonel
in
this
disposition
,
he
have
no
great
inclination
to
lengthen
out
his
visit
,
nor
do
the
colonel
himself
seem
to
desire
it
:
so
he
soon
return
back
to
his
Amelia
,
whom
he
find
perform
the
office
of
a
cook
,
with
as
much
pleasure
as
a
fine
lady
generally
enjoy
in
dress
herself
out
for
a
ball
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
history
look
a
little
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
proceed
farther
in
our
history
we
shall
recount
a
short
scene
to
our
reader
which
pass
between
Amelia
and
Mrs.
Ellison
whilst
<EOS>
Booth
be
on
his
visit
to
Colonel
Bath
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
observe
that
Amelia
have
conceive
an
extraordinary
affection
for
Mrs.
Bennet
,
which
have
still
encrease
every
time
she
see
her
;
she
think
she
discover
something
wonderfully
good
and
gentle
in
her
countenance
and
disposition
,
and
be
very
desirous
of
know
her
whole
history
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
a
very
short
interview
with
that
lady
this
morning
in
Mrs.
Ellison
's
apartment
.
<EOS>
as
soon
,
therefore
,
as
Mrs.
Bennet
be
go
,
Amelia
acquaint
Mrs.
Ellison
with
the
good
opinion
she
have
conceive
of
her
friend
,
and
likewise
with
her
curiosity
to
know
her
story
:
"
for
there
must
be
something
uncommonly
good
,
"
say
she
,
"
in
one
who
can
so
truly
mourn
for
a
husband
above
three
year
after
his
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
"
cry
Mrs.
Ellison
,
"
to
be
sure
the
world
must
allow
her
to
have
be
one
of
the
good
of
wife
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
upon
the
whole
,
she
be
a
good
sort
of
woman
;
and
what
I
like
her
the
good
for
be
a
strong
resemblance
that
she
bear
to
yourself
in
the
form
of
her
person
,
and
still
more
in
her
voice
.
<EOS>
but
for
my
own
part
,
I
know
nothing
remarkable
in
her
fortune
,
unless
what
I
have
tell
you
,
that
she
be
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
,
have
little
or
no
fortune
,
and
marry
a
poor
parson
for
love
,
who
leave
her
in
the
utmost
distress
.
<EOS>
if
you
please
,
I
will
shew
you
a
letter
which
she
writ
to
me
at
that
time
,
though
I
insist
upon
your
promise
never
to
mention
it
to
her
;
indeed
,
you
will
be
the
first
person
I
ever
shew
it
to
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
open
her
scrutore
,
and
,
take
out
the
letter
,
deliver
it
to
Amelia
,
say
,
"
there
,
madam
,
be
,
I
believe
,
as
fine
a
picture
of
distress
as
can
well
be
draw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
DEAR
madam
,
  
"
as
I
have
no
other
friend
on
earth
<EOS>
but
yourself
,
I
hope
you
will
pardon
my
writing
to
you
at
this
season
;
though
I
do
not
know
that
you
can
relieve
my
distress
,
or
,
if
you
can
,
have
I
any
pretence
to
expect
that
you
should
.
<EOS>
My
poor
dear

<EOS>
o
Heavens
 
my
 
lie
dead
in
the
house
;
and
,
after
I
have
procure
sufficient
to
bury
him
,
a
set
of
ruffian
have
enter
my
house
,
seize
all
I
have
<EOS>
,
have
seize
his

dear
corpse

and
threaten
to
deny
it
burial

<EOS>
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
send
me
,
at
least
,
some
advice
;
little
Tommy

Your

M.
BENNET

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
read
the
letter
over
twice
,
and
then
return
it
with
tear
in
her
eye
,
ask
how
the
poor
creature
could
possibly
get
through
such
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
madam
,
"
say
Mrs.
Ellison
,
"
the
moment
I
read
this
account
I
post
away
immediately
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
seize
the
body
,
that
I
find
be
a
mere
bugbear
;
but
all
the
rest
be
literally
true
.
<EOS>
I
send
immediately
for
the
same
gentleman
that
I
recommend
to
Mr.
Booth
,
leave
the
care
of
bury
the
corpse
to
him
,
and
bring
my
friend
and
her
little
boy
immediately
away
to
my
own
house
,
where
she
remain
some
month
in
the
most
miserable
condition
.
<EOS>
I
then
prevail
with
her
to
retire
into
the
country
,
and
procure
her
a
lodging
with
a
friend
at
St
Edmundsbury
,
the
air
and
gaiety
of
which
place
by
degree
recover
her
;
and
she
return
in
about
a
twelve
-
month
to
town
,
as
well
,
I
think
,
as
she
be
at
present

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
almost
afraid
to
ask

Amelia

yet
I
long
methink
to
know
what
be
become
of
the
poor
little
boy

"
  
"
He
hath
be
dead
,
"
say
Mrs.
Ellison
,
"
a
little
more
than
half
a
year
;
and
the
mother
lament
him
at
first
almost
as
much
as
she

her
husband

I
find
it
indeed
rather
an
easy
matter
to
comfort

I
sit
up
with

near
a
fortnight
upon

Our

fortunate

o

my

what
fortune
can

put
in

such
a

<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid

"
answer
Mrs.

"
you
would
not

the
scale
fairly

<EOS>
I
acknowledge
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Booth
be
a
very
pretty
gentleman
;
Heaven
forbid
I
should
endeavour
to
lessen
him
in
your
opinion
;
yet
,
if
I
be
to
be
bring
to
confession
,
I
could
not
help
say
I
see
where
the
superiority
lie
,
and
that
the
man
have
more
reason
to
envy
Mr.
Booth
than
the
woman
have
to
envy
his

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
will
not
bear
this
,

reply
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
forfeit
all
my
love
if
you
have
the
least
disrespectful
opinion
of
my
husband

<EOS>
You
do
not
know
him

Mrs.
Ellison

he
be
the
good
,
the
kind

the
worthy
of
all
his

<EOS>
I
have
observe
,
indeed
,
once

twice
before

that
you
have
take
some
dislike

him

<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
for
what
reason
.
<EOS>
if
he
hath
say
or
do
anything
to
disoblige
you

I
be
sure
I
can
justly
acquit
him
of
design

<EOS>
His
extreme
vivacity
make
him
sometimes
a

too
heedless

,
I
be
convince

a

innocent

low

I
find
indeed

as
Solomon

how
little
do
I
imagine

some
regard

he
be
a

genteel

that
I

I
scold
my

not

I

ask

to
walk
into

too
unguarded
in
my

I

"
She
then
begin
to
change
her
note
,
and
,
with
an
affected
laugh
,
turn
all
into
ridicule
;
and
soon
afterwards
the
two
lady
separate
,
both
in
apparent
good
humour
;
and
Amelia
go
about
those
domestic
office
in
which
Mr.
Booth
find
her
engage
at
the
end
of
the
precede
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
very
extraordinary
incident
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
Mr.
Booth
,
with
Amelia
and
her
child
,
go
to
refresh
themselves
in
the
Park
.
<EOS>
the
conversation
now
turn
on
what
past
in
the
morning
with
Mrs.
Ellison
,
the
latter
part
of
the
dialogue
,
I
mean
,
record
in
the
last
chapter
.
<EOS>
Amelia
tell
her
husband
that
Mrs.
Ellison
so
strongly
deny
all
intention
to
marry
the
serjeant
,
that
she
have
convince
her
the
poor
fellow
be
under
an
error
,
and
have
mistake
a
little
too
much
levity
for
serious
encouragement
;
and
conclude
by
desire
Booth
not
to
jest
with
her
any
more
on
that
subject
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
burst
into
a
laugh
at
what
his
wife
say
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
creature
,
"
say
he
,
"
how
easily
be
thy
honesty
and
simplicity
to
be
impose
on
!
<EOS>
how
little
dost
thou
guess
at
the
art
and
falsehood
of
woman
!
<EOS>
I
know
a
young
lady
who
,
against
her
father
's
consent
,
be
marry
to
a
brother
officer
of
mine
;
and
,
as
I
often
use
to
walk
with
her
(
for
I
know
her
father
intimately
well
)
,
she
would
of
her
own
accord
take
frequent
occasion
to
ridicule
and
vilify
her
husband
<EOS>
(
for
so
he
be
at
the
time
)
,
and
expr
great
wonder
and
indignation
at
the
report
which
she
allow
to
prevail
that
she
should
condescend
ever
to
look
at
such
a
fellow
with
any
other
design
than
of
laugh
at
and
despise
him
.
<EOS>
the
marriage
afterwards
become
publicly
own
,
and
the
lady
be
reputably
bring
to
bed
.
<EOS>
since
which
I
have
often
see
her
;
nor
hath
she
ever
appear
to
be
in
the
least
ashamed
of
what
she
have
formerly
say
,
though
,
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
believe
she
hate
me
heartily
for
have
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
for
what
reason
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
should
she
deny
a
fact
,
when
she
must
be
so
certain
of
our
discover
it
,
and
that
immediately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
answer
<EOS>
what
end
she
may
propose
,
"
say
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
sometimes
one
would
be
almost
persuade
that
there
be
a
pleasure
in
lie
itself
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
be
certain
,
that
I
would
believe
the
honest
serjeant
on
his
bare
word
sooner
than
I
would
fifty
Mrs.
Ellisons
on
oath
.
<EOS>
I
be
convinced
he
would
not
have
say
what
he
do
to
me
without
the
strong
encouragement
;
and
,
I
think
,
after
what
we
have
be
both
witness
to
,
it
require
no
great
confidence
in
his
veracity
to
give
him
an
unlimited
credit
with
regard
to
the
lady
's
behaviour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
Amelia
make
no
reply
;
and
they
discourse
of
other
matter
during
the
remainder
of
a
very
pleasant
walk
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
return
home
Amelia
be
surprize
to
find
an
appearance
of
disorder
in
her
apartment
.
<EOS>
several
of
the
trinket
which
his
lordship
have
give
the
child
lay
about
the
room
;
and
a
suit
of
her
own
cloath
,
which
she
have
leave
in
her
drawer
,
be
now
display
upon
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
She
immediately
summon
her
little
girl
up
-
stair
,
who
,
as
she
plainly
perceive
the
moment
she
come
up
with
a
candle
,
have
half
cry
her
eye
out
;
for
,
<EOS>
though
the
girl
have
open
the
door
to
them
,
as
it
be
almost
dark
,
she
have
not
take
any
notice
of
this
phenomenon
in
her
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
the
girl
now
fall
down
upon
her
knee
and
cry
,
"
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
madam
,
do
not
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
leave
alone
in
the
house
;
and
,
hear
somebody
knock
at
the
door
<EOS>
,
I
open
it
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
think
no
harm
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
but
<EOS>
it
may
have
be
you
,
or
my
master
,
or
Madam
Ellison
;
and
immediately
as
I
do
,
the
rogue
burst
in
and
run
directly
up
-
stair
,
and
what
he
hath
rob
you
of
I
can
not
tell
;
but
I
be
sure
I
could
not
help
it
,
for
he
be
a
great
swinging
man
with
a
pistol
in
each
hand
;
and
,
if
I
have
dare
to
call
out
,
to
be
sure
he
would
have
kill
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
be
never
in
such
a
fright
in
my
bear
day
,
whereof
I
be
hardly
come
to
myself
yet
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
somewhere
about
the
house
yet
,
for
I
never
see
him
go
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
discover
some
little
alarm
at
this
narrative
,
but
much
less
than
many
other
lady
would
have
shew
,
for
a
fright
be
,
I
believe
,
sometimes
lay
hold
of
as
an
opportunity
of
disclose
several
charm
peculiar
to
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
and
which
,
as
Mr.
Addison
say
of
certain
virtue
,
       
Shun
the
day
,
and
lie
conceal'd
     
<EOS>
in
the
smooth
season
and
the
calm
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
,
have
open
the
window
,
and
summon
in
two
chairman
to
his
assistance
,
proceed
to
search
the
house
;
but
all
to
no
purpose
;
the
thief
be
fly
,
though
the
poor
girl
,
in
her
state
of
terror
,
have
not
see
him
escape
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
a
circumstance
appear
which
greatly
surprize
both
Booth
and
Amelia
;
indeed
,
I
believe
it
will
have
the
same
effect
on
the
reader
;
and
this
be
,
that
the
thief
have
take
nothing
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
indeed
,
tumble
over
all
Booth
's
and
Amelia
's
cloath
and
the
child
's
toy
,
but
have
leave
all
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
be
scarce
more
pleased
than
astonished
at
this
discovery
,
and
re
-
examine
the
girl
,
assure
her
of
an
absolute
pardon
if
she
confess
the
truth
,
but
grievously
threaten
her
if
she
be
find
guilty
of
the
least
falsehood
.
"
<EOS>
as
for
a
thief
,
child
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
be
certainly
not
true
;
you
have
have
somebody
with
you
to
whom
you
have
be
shew
the
thing
;
therefore
tell
me
plainly
who
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
girl
protest
in
the
solemn
manner
that
she
know
not
the
person
;
but
as
to
some
circumstance
she
begin
to
vary
a
little
from
her
first
account
,
particularly
as
to
the
pistol
,
concern
which
,
be
strictly
examine
by
Booth
,
she
at
last
cry
 
"
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
he
must
have
have
pistol
about
him
.
"
<EOS>
and
instead
of
persist
in
his
have
rush
in
upon
her
,
she
now
confess
that
he
have
ask
at
the
door
for
her
master
and
mistress
;
and
that
at
his
desire
she
have
shew
him
up
-
stair
,
where
he
at
first
say
he
would
stay
till
their
return
home
;
"
but
,
indeed
,
"
cry
she
<EOS>
,
"
I
think
no
harm
,
for
he
look
like
a
gentleman
-
like
sort
of
man
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
so
I
think
he
be
for
a
good
while
,
whereof
he
sit
down
and
behave
himself
very
civilly
,
till
he
see
some
of
master
's
and
miss
's
thing
upon
the
chest
of
drawer
;
whereof
he
cry
,
"
Hey
-
day
!
<EOS>
what
be
here
?
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
fall
to
tumble
about
the
thing
like
any
mad
.
<EOS>
then
I
think
,
think
I
to
myself
,
to
be
sure
he
be
a
highwayman
,
<EOS>
whereof
I
do
not
dare
speak
to
him
;
for
I
know
Madam
Ellison
and
her
maid
be
go
out
,
and
what
could
such
a
poor
girl
as
I
do
against
a
great
strong
man
?
<EOS>
and
besides
,
think
I
,
to
be
sure
he
hath
get
pistol
about
him
,
though
I
can
not
indeed
,
(
that
I
will
not
do
for
the
world
)
take
my
Bible
-
oath
that
I
see
any
;
yet
to
be
sure
he
would
have
soon
pull
them
out
and
shoot
me
dead
if
I
have
venture
to
have
say
anything
to
offend
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
to
make
of
this
,
"
cry
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
,
I
verily
believe
,
speak
to
the
good
of
her
knowledge
.
<EOS>
a
thief
it
could
not
be
,
for
he
hath
not
take
the
least
thing
;
and
it
be
plain
he
have
the
girl
's
watch
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
be
a
bailiff
,
surely
he
would
have
staid
till
our
return
.
<EOS>
I
can
conceive
no
other
from
the
girl
's
account
than
that
it
must
have
be
some
madman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
o
good
sir
!
"
say
the
girl
,
"
now
you
mention
it
,
if
he
be
not
a
thief
,
to
be
sure
he
must
have
be
a
madman
:
for
indeed
he
look
,
and
behave
himself
too
,
very
much
like
a
madman
;
for
,
now
I
remember
it
,
he
talk
to
himself
and
say
many
strange
kind
of
word
that
I
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
look
altogether
as
I
have
see
people
in
Bedlam
;
besides
,
if
he
be
not
a
madman
,
what
good
could
it
do
him
to
throw
the
thing
all
about
the
room
in
such
a
manner
?
<EOS>
and
he
say
something
too
about
my
master
just
before
he
go
down
-
stair
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
such
a
fright
<EOS>
I
can
not
remember
particularly
,
but
I
be
sure
they
be
very
ill
word
;
he
say
he
would
do
for
him
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
say
that
,
and
other
wicked
bad
word
too
,
if
I
could
but
think
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
this
be
the
most
probable
conjecture
;
but
still
I
be
puzzle
to
conceive
who
it
should
be
,
for
I
have
no
madman
to
my
knowledge
of
my
acquaintance
,
and
it
seem
,
as
the
girl
say
,
he
ask
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
turn
to
the
child
,
and
ask
her
if
she
be
certain
of
that
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
maid
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
answer
,
"
indeed
,
sir
,
I
can
not
be
very
positive
;
for
the
fright
he
throw
me
into
afterwards
drive
everything
almost
out
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
whatever
he
be
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
<EOS>
I
be
glad
the
consequence
be
no
bad
;
but
let
this
be
a
warning
to
you
,
little
Betty
,
and
teach
you
to
take
more
care
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
if
ever
you
should
be
leave
alone
in
the
house
again
,
be
sure
to
let
no
person
in
without
first
look
out
at
the
window
and
see
who
they
be
.
<EOS>
I
promise
not
to
chide
you
any
more
on
this
occasion
,
and
I
will
keep
my
word
;
but
it
be
very
plain
you
desire
this
person
to
walk
up
into
our
apartment
,
which
be
very
wrong
in
our
absence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Betty
be
go
to
answer
,
but
Amelia
would
not
let
her
,
say
,
"
do
not
attempt
to
excuse
yourself
;
for
I
mortally
hate
a
liar
,
and
can
forgive
any
fault
sooner
than
falsehood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
then
submit
;
and
now
Amelia
,
with
her
assistance
,
begin
to
replace
all
thing
in
their
order
;
and
little
Emily
hug
her
watch
with
great
fondness
,
declare
she
would
never
part
with
it
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
thus
end
this
odd
adventure
,
not
entirely
to
the
satisfaction
of
Booth
;
for
,
besides
his
curiosity
,
which
,
when
thoroughly
rouse
,
be
a
very
troublesome
passion
,
he
have
,
<EOS>
as
be
I
believe
usual
with
all
person
in
his
circumstance
,
several
doubt
and
apprehension
of
he
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
fear
be
never
more
uneasy
than
when
it
doth
not
certainly
know
its
object
;
for
on
such
occasion
the
mind
be
ever
employ
in
raise
a
thousand
bugbear
and
fantom
,
much
more
dreadful
than
any
reality
,
and
,
like
child
when
they
tell
tale
of
hobgoblin
,
seem
industrious
in
terrify
itself
.
    
<EOS>
contain
some
matter
not
very
unnatural
.
 
<EOS>
matter
be
scarce
sooner
reduce
into
order
and
decency
than
a
violent
knocking
be
hear
at
the
door
,
such
indeed
as
would
have
persuade
any
one
not
accustomed
to
the
sound
that
the
madman
be
return
in
the
high
spring
-
tide
of
his
fury
.
  
<EOS>
instead
,
however
,
of
so
disagreeable
an
appearance
,
a
very
fine
lady
presently
come
into
the
room
,
no
other
,
indeed
,
than
Mrs.
James
herself
;
for
she
be
resolve
to
shew
Amelia
,
by
the
speedy
return
of
her
visit
<EOS>
,
how
unjust
all
her
accusation
have
be
of
any
failure
in
the
duty
of
friendship
;
she
have
,
moreover
,
another
reason
to
accelerate
this
visit
,
and
that
be
,
to
congratulate
her
friend
on
the
event
of
the
duel
between
Colonel
Bath
and
Mr.
Booth
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
have
so
well
profit
by
Mrs.
Booth
's
remonstrance
,
that
she
have
now
no
more
of
that
stiffness
and
formality
which
she
have
wear
on
a
former
occasion
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
she
now
behave
with
the
utmost
freedom
and
good
-
humour
,
and
make
herself
so
very
agreeable
,
that
Amelia
be
highly
pleased
and
delighted
with
her
company
.
  
<EOS>
an
incident
happen
during
this
visit
,
that
may
appear
to
some
too
inconsiderable
in
itself
to
be
record
;
and
yet
,
as
it
certainly
produce
a
very
strong
consequence
in
the
mind
of
Mr.
Booth
,
we
can
not
prevail
on
ourselves
to
pass
it
by
.

Little
Emily

who
be

in

while
Mrs.

lady
happen
to

with
her
watch

which
she
be
so
greatly
overjoyed
have

safe
from
the

Mrs.

,
who
exprest
great

desire
to
see
the

which
she
commend
as
the
prettiest
of
the
kind

<EOS>
Amelia
catch
eager
hold
of
this
opportunity
to
spread
the
praise
of
her
benefactor
.
<EOS>
She
presently
acquaint
Mrs.

with
the
donor
's
name
,
and
run
on
with
great
encomium
on
his
lordship
's
goodness
,
and
particularly
on
his
generosity
.
<EOS>
to
which
Mrs.

answer
,
"

<EOS>
certainly
,

his

hath
universally
the

"
  
<EOS>
in
utter
these
word
she
lay
a
very
strong
emphasis
on
the
three
last
monosyllable
,
accompany
them
at
the

time
with
a
very
sagacious
look
,
a
very
significant

a

I
think
,
no

;
for
at
this
speech
of
Mrs.

he
immediately
turn
pale
,
and
,
from
a
high
degree
of
chearfulness
,
be
all
on
a
sudden
strike
dumb
,
so
that
he
speak
not

till
Mrs.

leave
the

<EOS>
the
moment
that

drive
from

She
enter
the

with
a

very
plentifully
rally
both
Booth

the
madman

of
which
she
have
receive
a
full
account
below

stair
;
and
at
last
ask
Amelia
if
she
could
not
guess
who
it
be
;
but
,
without
receive
an
answer
,
go
on
,
say
,
"
for
my

I
know
not
what
to

<EOS>
perhaps
it
may
be
some
rogue
that
intend

fail
him

You
can
not

my

that
I
must
have
a
violent
desire
to
know
the
reason
of

I
own
I
never

long

I
will
convince
you
I

I
can
not

make
me
one
of
the
most
miserable
of
woman

that

"
in
other

my

why
,
then
,
positively
,
"

Booth

I
will
tell

well
you
may
know
the
duty

I
be
not

able

in

word

my

no

unwille

I

<EOS>
o

Mr.

<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
!
<EOS>
you
must
well
know
that
a
woman
's
virtue
be
always
her
sufficient
guard
.
<EOS>
no
husband
,
without
suspect
that
,
can
suspect
any
danger
from
those
snare
you
mention
;
and
why
,
if
you
be
liable
to
take
such
thing
into
your
head
,
may
not
your
suspicion
fall
on
me
as
well
as
on
any
other
?
<EOS>
for
sure
nothing
be
ever
more
unjust
,
I
will
not
say
ungrateful
,
than
the
suspicion
which
you
have
bestow
on
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
I
do
solemnly
declare
,
in
all
the
time
I
have
see
the
poor
man
<EOS>
,
he
hath
never
once
offer
the
least
forwardness
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
hath
be
polite
indeed
,
but
rather
remarkably
distant
than
otherwise
.
<EOS>
particularly
when
we
play
at
card
together
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
he
speak
ten
word
to
me
all
the
evening
;
and
when
I
be
at
his
house
,
though
he
shew
the
great
fondness
imaginable
to
the
child
,
he
take
so
little
notice
of
me
,
that
a
vain
woman
would
have
be
very
little
pleased
with
him
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
give
them
many
present
,
he
never
offer
me
one
.
<EOS>
the
first
,
indeed
,
which
he
ever
offer
me
be
that
which
you
in
that
kind
manner
force
me
to
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
this
may
be
only
the
effect
of
art
,
"
say
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
convince
he
doth
,
nay
,
I
be
convinced
he
must
like
you

my
good
friend
James
,
who
perfectly
well
know
the
world
,
tell
me
,
that
his
lordship
's
character
be
that
of
the
most
profuse
in
his
pleasure
with
woman
;

what

Mrs.

this
very
evening

extremely
generous

never

sneer

which
she
speak

I
be

injure
him

Amelia

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
for
Mrs.
James
,
she
be
always
give
to
be
censorious
;
I
remark
it
in
her
long
ago
,
as
her
great
fault
.
<EOS>
and
for
the
colonel
,
I
believe
he
may
find
fault
enow
of
this
kind
in
his
own
bosom
,
without
search
after
them
among
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
hath
the
most
impudent
look
of
all
the
man
I
know
;
and
I
solemnly
declare
,
the
very
last
time
he
be
here
<EOS>
he
put
me
out
of
countenance
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Colonel
James
,
"
answer
Booth
,
"
may
have
his
fault
very
probably
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
look
upon
him
as
a
saint
,
nor
do
I
believe
he
desire
I
should
;
but
what
interest
could
he
have
in
abuse
this
lord
's
character
to
me
?
<EOS>
or
why
should
I
question
his
truth
,
when
he
assure
me
that
my
lord
have
never
do
an
act
of
beneficence
in
his
life
but
for
the
sake
of
some
woman
whom
he
lust
after
?

<EOS>
"
then
I
myself
can
confute
him

Amelia

"
for
,
besides
his
service
to
you
,
which
,
for
the
future
,
I
shall
wish
to

his
kindness
to
my

how
inconsistent
be
the
character

James
give

I
need
not

all
that
I
have
hear
from
Mrs.

every
word

I

have
not

so

I

must
,
I

much

by

reconciliation
soon

complete

Booth

in
the
contemplation

entirely
bury
all
his
jealous
thought

<EOS>
a
chapter
in

there
be
much
learn

<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
whilst

be
go
to
take
his
morning
walk

Amelia
go
down
into
Mrs.

apartment

where
,
though
she
be
receive
with
great
civility
,
yet
she
find
that
lady
be
not
at
all
please
with
Mr.
Booth
;
and
,
by
some
hint
which
dropt
from
her
in
conversation
<EOS>
,
Amelia
very
greatly
apprehend
that
Mrs.
Ellison
have
too
much
suspicion
of
her
husband
's
real
uneasiness
;
for
that
lady
declare
very
openly
she
could
not
help
perceive
what
sort
of
man
<EOS>
Mr.

be
:
"

yet
I
think
myself
in
honour
oblige
not
to
impose
on
his
lordship

,
I
know
very
well

hath
conceive
his
great
like

the
captain

my
tell
him
that
he
be
the
good
husband
in

"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
's
fear
give
her
much
disturbance
,
and
when
her
husband
return
she
acquaint
him
with
them
;
upon
which
occasion
,
as
it
be
natural
,
she
resume
a
little
the
topic
of
their
former
discourse
,
nor
could
she
help
cast
,
though
in
very
gentle
term
,
some
slight
blame
on
Booth
for
have
entertain
a
suspicion
which
,
she
say
,
may
in
its
consequence
very
possibly
prove
their
ruin
,
and
occasion
the
loss
of
his
lordship
's
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
become
highly
affected
with
what
his
wife
say
,
and
the
more
,
as
he
have
just
receive
a
note
from
Colonel
James
,
inform
him
that
the
colonel
have
hear
of
a
vacant
company
in
the
regiment
which
Booth
have
mention
to
him

that
he
have
be
with

about
it

obtain
him
the

Amelia
no
sooner
see

instantly
forbear
whatever
may

aggravate

apply
herself

with
all
her

to

know

well

diversion

induce
me
to
mention
what
I
be
now
go
to
propose
;
and
in
that
confidence
I
will
ask
you
to
let
me
accept
my
lord
's
and
Mrs.
Ellison
's
offer
,
and
go
to
the
masquerade
.
<EOS>
no
matter
how
little
while
I
stay
there
;
if
you
desire
it
I
will
not
be
an
hour
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
make
an
hundred
excuse
to
come
home
,
or
tell
a
real
truth
,
and
say
I
be
tired
with
the
place
.
<EOS>
the
bare
go
will
cure
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
have
no
sooner
do
speak
than
Booth
immediately
approve
her
advice
,
and
readily
give
his
consent
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
however
,
help
say
,
that
the
short
her
stay
be
there
,
the
more
agreeable
it
would
be
to
him
;
"
for
you
know
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
would
never
willingly
be
a
moment
out
of
your
sight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
Amelia
send
to
invite
Mrs.
Ellison
to
a
dish
of
tea
;
and
Booth
undertake
to
laugh
off
all
that
have
pass
yesterday
,
in
which
attempt
the
abundant
good
humour
of
that
lady
give
him
great
hope
of
success
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
come
that
afternoon
to
make
a
visit
,
and
be
almost
an
hour
with
Booth
and
Amelia
before
the
entry
of
Mrs.
Ellison
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
have
hitherto
rather
dislike
this
young
lady
,
and
have
wonder
at
the
pleasure
which
Amelia
declare
she
take
in
her
company
.
<EOS>
this
afternoon
,
however
,
he
change
his
opinion
,
and
like
her
almost
as
much
as
his
wife
have
do
.
<EOS>
She
do
indeed
behave
at
this
time
with
more
than
ordinary
gaiety
;
and
good
humour
give
a
glow
to
her
countenance
that
set
off
her
feature
,
which
be
very
pretty
,
to
the
good
advantage
,
and
lessen
the
deadness
that
have
usually
appear
in
her
complexion
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
Booth
be
now
pleased
with
Mrs.
Bennet
,
Amelia
be
still
more
pleased
with
her
than
ever
.
<EOS>
for
,
when
their
discourse
turn
on
love
,
Amelia
discover
that
her
new
friend
have
all
the
same
sentiment
on
that
subject
with
herself
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
Booth
give
Mrs.
Bennet
a
hint
of
wish
her
a
good
husband
,
upon
which
both
the
lady
declaim
against
second
marriage
with
equal
vehemence
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
occasion
Booth
and
his
wife
discover
a
talent
in
their
visitant
to
which
they
have
be
before
entirely
stranger
,
and
for
which
they
both
greatly
admire
her
,
and
this
be
,
that
the
lady
be
a
good
scholar
,
in
which
,
indeed
,
she
have
the
advantage
of
poor
Amelia
,
whose
reading
be
confine
to
English
play
and
poetry
;
besides
which
,
I
think
she
have
converse
only
with
the
divinity
of
the
great
and
learn
Dr
Barrow
,
and
with
the
history
of
the
excellent
Bishop
Burnet
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
deliver
herself
on
the
subject
of
second
marriage
with
much
eloquence
and
great
good
sense
;
but
when
Mrs.
Bennet
come
to
give
her
opinion
she
speak
in
the
follow
manner
:
"
I
shall
not
enter
into
the
question
concern
the
legality
of
bigamy
.
<EOS>
Our
law
certainly
allow
it
,
and
so
,
I
think
,
doth
our
religion
.
<EOS>
We
be
now
debate
only
on
the
decency
of
it
,
and
in
this
light
I
own
myself
as
strenuous
an
advocate
against
it
as
any
roman
matron
would
have
be
in
those
age
of
the
commonwealth
when
it
be
hold
to
be
infamous
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
how
great
a
paradox
soever
my
opinion
may
seem
,
I
solemnly
declare
,
I
see
but
<EOS>
little
difference
between
have
two
husband
at
one
time
and
at
several
time
;
and
of
this
I
be
very
confident
,
that
the
same
degree
of
love
for
a
first
husband
which
preserve
a
woman
in
the
one
case
will
preserve
her
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
argument
which
I
scarce
know
how
to
deliver
before
you
,
sir
;
but
 
if
a
woman
hath
live
with
her
first
husband
without
have
child
,
I
think
it
unpardonable
in
her
to
carry
barrenness
into
a
second
family
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
if
she
hath
child
by
her
first
husband
,
to
give
them
a
second
father
be
still
more
unpardonable
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
suppose
,
madam
,
"
cry
Booth
,
interrupt
her
with
a
smile
,
"
she
should
have
have
child
by
her
first
husband
,
and
have
lose
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
case
,
"
answer
she
,
with
a
sigh
,
"
which
I
do
not
desire
to
think
of
,
and
I
must
own
it
the
most
favourable
light
in
which
a
second
marriage
can
be
see
.
<EOS>
but
the
scripture
,
as
Petrarch
observe
,
rather
suffer
them
than
commend
them
;
and
St
Jerom
speak
against
them
with
the
utmost
bitterness
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
remember
,
"
cry
Booth
(
who
be
willing
either
to
shew
his
learning
,
or
to
draw
out
the
lady
's
)
,
"
a
very
wise
law
of
Charondas
,
the
famous
lawgiver
of
Thurium
,
by
which
man
who
marry
a
second
time
be
remove
from
all
public
council
;
for
it
be
scarce
reasonable
to
suppose
that
he
who
be
so
great
<EOS>
a
fool
in
his
own
family
should
be
wise
in
public
affair
.
<EOS>
and
though
second
marriage
be
permit
among
the
Romans
,
yet
they
be
at
the
same
time
discourage
,
and
those
roman
widow
who
refuse
them
be
hold
in
high
esteem
,
and
honour
with
what
Valerius
Maximus
call
the
Corona
Pudicitiae
.
<EOS>
in
the
noble
family
of
Camilli
there
be
not
,
in
many
age
,
a
single
instance
of
this
,
which
Martial
call
adultery
:
  
<EOS>
Quae
totie
nubit
,
non
nubit
;
adultera
lege
est
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bennet
,
"
and
Virgil
call
this
a
violation
of
chastity
,
and
make
Dido
speak
of
it
with
the
utmost
detestation
:
  
Sed

Ille

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
repeat
these
line
with
so
strong
an
emphasis
,
that
she
almost
frighten
Amelia
out
of
her
wit
,
and
not
a
little
staggered
Booth
,
who
be
himself
no
contemptible
scholar
.
<EOS>
He
express
great
admiration
of
the
lady
's
learning
;
upon
which
she
say
it
be
all
the
fortune
give
her
by
her
father
,
and
all
the
dower
leave
her
by
her
husband
;
"
and
sometimes
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
be
inclined
to
think
I
enjoy
more
pleasure
from
it
than
if
they
have
bestow
on
me
what
the
world
would
in
general
call
more
valuable
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
then
take
occasion
,
from
the
surprize
which
Booth
have
affect
to
conceive
at
her
repeat
Latin
with
so
good
a
grace
,
to
comment
on
that
great
absurdity
<EOS>
(
for
so
she
term
it
)
of
exclude
woman
from
learn
;
for
which
they
be
equally
qualified
with
the
man
,
and
in
which
so
many
have
make
so
notable
a
proficiency
;
for
a
proof
of
which
she
mention
Madam
Dacier
,
and
many
other
.
  
<EOS>
though
both
Booth
and
Amelia
outwardly
concur
with
her
sentiment
,
it
may
be
a
question
whether
they
do
not
assent
rather
out
of
complaisance
than
from
their
real
judgment
.
    
<EOS>
contain
some
unaccountable
behaviour
in
Mrs.
Ellison
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
make
her
entrance
at
the
end
of
the
precede
discourse
.
<EOS>
at
her
first
appearance
she
put
on
an
unusual
degree
of
formality
and
reserve
;
but
when
Amelia
have
acquaint
her
that
she
design
to
accept
the
favour
intend
her
,
she
soon
begin
to
alter
the
gravity
of
her
muscle
,
and
presently
fall
in
with
that
ridicule
which
Booth
think
proper
to
throw
on
his
yesterday
's
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
now
become
very
lively
and
pleasant
,
in
which
Booth
have
mention
the
discourse
that
pass
in
the
last
chapter
,
and
have
greatly
compliment
Mrs.
Bennet
's
speech
on
that
occasion
,
Mrs.
Ellison
,
who
be
as
strenuous
an
advocate
on
the
other
side
,
begin
to
rally
that
lady
extremely
,
declare
it
be
a
certain
sign
she
intend
to
marry
again
soon
.
"
<EOS>
married
lady
,
"
cry
she
,
"
I
believe
,
sometimes
think
themselves
in
earnest
in
such
declaration
,
though
they
be
oftener
perhaps
mean
as
compliment
to
their
husband
;
but
,
when
widow
exclaim
loudly
against
second
marriage
,
I
would
always
lay
a
wager
that
the
man
,
if
not
the
wedding
-
day
,
be
absolutely
fix
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
make
very
little
answer
to
this
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
have
scarce
open
her
lip
from
the
time
of
Mrs.
Ellison
be
come
into
the
room
,
and
have
grow
particularly
grave
at
the
mention
of
the
masquerade
.
<EOS>
Amelia
impute
this
to
her
be
leave
out
of
the
party
,
a
matter
which
be
often
no
small
mortification
to
human
pride
,
and
in
a
whisper
ask
Mrs.
Ellison
if
she
could
not
procure
a
third
ticket
,
to
which
she
receive
an
absolute
negative
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
whole
time
of
Mrs.
Bennet
's
stay
,
which
be
above
an
hour
afterwards
,
she
remain
perfectly
silent
,
and
look
extremely
melancholy
.
<EOS>
this
make
Amelia
very
uneasy
,
as
she
conclude
she
have
guess
the
cause
of
her
vexation
.
<EOS>
in
which
opinion
<EOS>
she
be
the
more
confirm
from
certain
look
of
no
very
pleasant
kind
which
Mrs.
Bennet
now
and
then
cast
on
Mrs.
Ellison
,
and
the
more
than
ordinary
concern
that
appear
in
the
former
lady
's
countenance
whenever
the
masquerade
be
mention
,
and
which
;
unfortunately
,
be
the
principal
topic
of
their
discourse
;
for
Mrs.
Ellison
give
a
very
elaborate
description
of
the
extreme
beauty
of
the
place
and
elegance
of
the
diversion
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Bennet
be
depart
,
Amelia
could
not
help
again
solicit
Mrs.
Ellison
for
another
ticket
,
declare
she
be
certain
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
have
a
great
inclination
to
go
with
them
;
but
Mrs.
Ellison
again
excuse
herself
from
ask
it
of
his
lordship
.
"
<EOS>
besides
,
madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
if
I
would
go
thither
with
Mrs.
Bennet
,
which
,
I
own
to
you
,
I
do
not
chuse
,
as
she
be
a
person
whom
nobody
know
,
<EOS>
I
very
much
doubt
whether
she
herself
would
like
it
;
<EOS>
for
she
be
a
woman
of
a
very
unaccountable
turn
.
<EOS>
all
her
delight
lie
in
book
;
and
as
for
public
diversion
,
I
have
hear
her
often
declare
her
abhorrence
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
then
,
"
say
Amelia
,
"
could
occasion
all
that
gravity
from
the
moment
the
masquerade
be
mention
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
that
,
"
answer
the
other
,
"
there
be
no
guessing
.
<EOS>
You
have
see
her
altogether
as
grave
before
now
.
<EOS>
She
hath
have
these
fit
of
gravity
at
time
ever
since
the
death
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
creature
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Amelia
;
"
I
heartily
pity
her
,
for
she
must
certainly
suffer
a
great
deal
on
these
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
have
take
a
strange
fancy
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
would
not
like
her
<EOS>
so
well
if
you
know
her
thoroughly
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Ellison
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
but
of
a
whimsical
temper
;
and
,
if
you
will
take
my
opinion
,
you
should
not
cultivate
too
much
intimacy
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
never
mention
what
I
say
;
but
she
be
like
some
picture
,
which
please
best
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
do
not
seem
to
agree
with
these
sentiment
,
and
she
greatly
importune
Mrs.
Ellison
to
be
more
explicit
,
but
to
no
purpose
;
she
continue
to
give
only
dark
hint
to
Mrs.
Bennet
's
disadvantage
;
and
,
if
ever
she
let
drop
something
a
little
too
harsh
,
she
fail
not
immediately
to
contradict
herself
by
throw
some
gentle
commendation
into
the
other
scale
;
so
that
her
conduct
appear
utterly
unaccountable
to
Amelia
,
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
she
know
not
whether
to
conclude
Mrs.
Ellison
to
be
a
friend
or
enemy
to
Mrs.
Bennet
.
  
<EOS>
during
this
latter
conversation
Booth
be
not
in
the
room
,
for
he
have
be
summon
down
-
stair
by
the
serjeant
,
who
come
to
him
with
news
from
Murphy
,
whom
he
have
meet
that
evening
,
and
who
assure
the
serjeant
that
,
if
he
be
desirous
of
recover
the
debt
which
he
have
before
pretend
to
have
on
Booth
,
he
may
shortly
have
an
opportunity
,
for
that
there
be
to
be
a
very
strong
petition
to
the
board
the
next
time
they
sit
.
<EOS>
Murphy
say
further
that
he
nee
not
fear
have
his
money
,
for
that
,
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
the
captain
have
several
thing
of
great
value
,
and
even
his
child
have
gold
watch
.
  
<EOS>
this
greatly
alarm
Booth
,
and
still
more
when
the
serjeant
report
to
him
,
from
Murphy
,
that
all
these
thing
have
be
see
in
his
possession
within
a
day
last
past
.
<EOS>
He
now
plainly
perceive
,
as
he
think
,
that
Murphy
himself
,
or
one
of
his
emissary
,
have
be
the
suppose
madman
;
and
he
now
very
well
account
to
himself
,
in
his
own
mind
,
for
all
that
have
happen
,
conceive
that
the
design
be
to
examine
into
the
state
of
his
effect
,
and
to
try
whether
it
be
worth
his
creditor
'
while
to
plunder
him
by
law
.
  
<EOS>
at
his
return
to
his
apartment
he
communicate
what
he
have
hear
to
Amelia
and
Mrs.
Ellison
,
not
disguise
his
apprehension
of
the
enemy
's
intention
;
but
Mrs.
Ellison
endeavour
to
laugh
him
out
of
his
fear
,
call
him
faint
-
hearted
,
and
assure
him
he
may
depend
on
her
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
till
you
hear
from
him
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
may
rest
entirely
contented
:
for
,
take
my
word
for
it

no
danger
can
happen
to
you
of
which
you
will
not
be
timely
apprize
by
him
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
the
fellow
that
have
the
impudence
to
come
into
your
room
,
if
he
be
send
on
such
an
errand
as
you
mention
,
I
heartily
wish
I
have
be
at
home
;
I
would
have
secure
him
safe
with
a
constable
,
and
have
carry
him
directly
before
justice
Thresher
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
justice
be
an
enemy
to
bailiff
on
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
heartening
speech
a
little
rouse
the
courage
of
Booth
,
and
somewhat
comfort
Amelia
,
though
the
spirit
of
both
have
be
too
much
hurried
to
suffer
them
either
to
give
or
receive
much
entertainment
that
evening
;
which
Mrs.
Ellison
perceive
soon
take
her
leave
,
and
leave
this
unhappy
couple
to
seek
relief
from
sleep
,
that
powerful
friend
to
the
distrest
,
though
,
like
other
powerful
friend
,
he
be
not
always
ready
to
give
his
assistance
to
those
who
want
it
most
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
very
strange
incident
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
husband
and
wife
be
alone
they
again
talk
over
the
news
which
the
serjeant
have
bring
;
on
which
occasion
<EOS>
Amelia
do
all
she
could
to
conceal
her
own
fear
,
and
to
quiet
those
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
turn
the
conversation
to
another
subject
,
and
poor
Mrs.
Bennet
be
bring
on
the
carpet
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
to
find
I
have
conceive
an
affection
for
a
bad
woman
;
and
yet
I
begin
to
fear
Mrs.
Ellison
know
something
of
her
more
than
she
care
to
discover
;
why
else
should
she
be
unwilling
to
be
see
with
her
in
public
?
<EOS>
besides
,
I
have
observe
that
Mrs.
Ellison
hath
be
always
backward
to
introduce
her
to
me
,
nor
would
ever
bring
her
to
my
apartment
,
though
I
have
often
desire
her
.
<EOS>
nay
,
she
hath
give
me
frequent
hint
not
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
contract
an
intimacy
with
a
wicked
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
dear
,
"
cry
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
more
of
her
,
nor
indeed
hardly
so
much
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
think
,
that
if
Mrs.
Ellison
know
any
reason
why
she
should
not
have
introduce
Mrs.
Bennet
into
your
company
,
she
be
very
much
in
the
wrong
in
introduce
her
into
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
discourse
of
this
kind
they
past
the
remainder
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
Booth
rise
early
,
and
,
go
down
-
stair
,
receive
from
little
Betty
a
seal
note
,
which
contain
the
follow
word
:
       
Beware
,
beware
,
beware
;
     
<EOS>
for
I
apprehend
a
dreadful
snare
     
<EOS>
be
lay
for
virtuous
innocence
,
     
under
a
friend
's
false
pretence
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
immediately
enquire
of
the
girl
who
bring
this
note
?
<EOS>
and
be
tell
it
come
by
a
chair
-
man
,
who
,
have
deliver
it
,
depart
without
say
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
extremely
staggered
at
what
he
read
,
and
presently
refer
the
advice
to
the
same
affair
on
which
he
have
receive
those
hint
from
Atkinson
the
precede
evening
;
but
when
he
come
to
consider
the
word
more
maturely
he
could
not
so
well
reconcile
the
two
last
line
of
this
poetical
epistle
,
if
it
may
be
so
call
,
with
any
danger
which
the
law
give
him
reason
to
apprehend
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Murphy
and
his
gang
could
not
well
be
say
to
attack
either
his
innocence
or
virtue
;
nor
do
they
attack
him
under
any
colour
or
pretence
of
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
after
much
deliberation
on
this
matter
a
very
strange
suspicion
come
into
his
head
;
and
this
be
,
that
he
be
betray
by
Mrs.
Ellison
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
for
some
time
,
conceive
no
very
high
opinion
of
that
good
gentlewoman
,
and
he
now
begin
to
suspect
that
she
be
bribe
to
betray
him
.
<EOS>
by
this
mean
he
think
he
could
best
account
for
the
strange
appearance
of
the
suppose
madman
.
<EOS>
and
when
this
conceit
once
have
birth
in
his
mind
,
several
circumstance
nourish
and
improve
it
.
<EOS>
among
these
be
her
jocose
behaviour
and
raillery
on
that
occasion
,
and
her
attempt
to
ridicule
his
fear
from
the
message
which
the
serjeant
have
bring
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
suspicion
be
indeed
preposterous
,
and
not
at
all
warrant
by
,
or
even
consistent
with
,
the
character
and
whole
behaviour
of
Mrs.
Ellison
,
but
it
be
the
only
one
which
at
that
time
suggest
itself
to
his
mind
;
and
,
however
blameable
it
may
be
,
it
be
certainly
not
unnatural
in
him
to
entertain
it
;
for
so
great
a
torment
be
anxiety
to
the
human
mind
,
that
we
always
endeavour
to
relieve
ourselves
from
it
by
guess
,
however
doubtful
or
uncertain
;
on
all
which
occasion
,
dislike
and
hatred
be
the
sure
guide
to
lead
our
suspicion
to
its
object
.
  
<EOS>
when
Amelia
rise
to
breakfast
,
Booth
produce
the
note
which
he
have
receive
,
say
,
"
My
dear
,
you
have
so
often
blame
me
for
keep
secret
from
you
,
and
I
have
so
often
,
indeed
,
endeavour
to
conceal
secret
of
this
kind
from
you
with
such
ill
success
,
<EOS>
that
I
think
I
shall
never
more
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
"
Amelia
read
the
letter
hastily
,
and
seem
not
a
little
discomposed
;
then
,
turn
to
Booth
with
a
very
disconsolate
countenance
,
she
say
,
"
sure
fortune
take
a
delight
in
terrify
us
!
<EOS>
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
?
"
<EOS>
then
,
fix
her
eye
attentively
on
the
paper
,
she
peruse
it
for
some
time
,
till
Booth
cry
,
"
how
be
it
possible
,
my
Emily
,
you
can
read
such
stuff
patiently
?
<EOS>
the
verse
be
certainly
as
bad
as
ever
be
write
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
try
,
my
dear
,
"
answer
she
,
"
to
recollect
the
hand
;
for
I
will
take
my
oath
<EOS>
I
have
see
it
before
,
and
that
very
lately
;
"
and
suddenly
she
cry
out
,
with
great
emotion
,
"
I
remember
it
perfectly
now
;
it
be
Mrs.
Bennet
's
hand
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ellison
shew
me
a
letter
from
her
but
a
day
or
two
ago
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
remarkable
hand
,
and
I
be
positive
it
be
hers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
hers
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
what
can
she
possibly
mean
by
the
latter
part
of
her
caution
?
<EOS>
sure
Mrs.
Ellison
hath
no
intention
to
betray
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
she
mean
,
"
answer
Amelia
,
"
but
I
be
resolve
to
know
immediately
,
for
I
be
certain
of
the
hand
.
<EOS>
by
the
great
luck
in
the
world
,
she
tell
me
yesterday
where
her
lodging
be
,
when
she
press
me
exceedingly
to
come
and
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
live
but
a
very
few
door
from
us
,
and
I
will
go
to
her
this
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
make
not
the
least
objection
to
his
wife
's
design
.
<EOS>
His
curiosity
be
,
indeed
,
as
great
as
hers
,
and
so
be
his
impatience
to
satisfy
it
,
though
he
mention
not
this
his
impatience
to
Amelia
;
and
perhaps
it
have
be
well
for
him
if
he
have
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
therefore
,
presently
equip
herself
in
her
walking
dress
,
and
,
leave
her
child
to
the
care
of
her
husband
,
make
all
possible
haste
to
Mrs.
Bennet
's
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
wait
near
five
minute
at
Mrs.
Bennet
's
door
before
any
one
come
to
open
it
;
at
length
a
maid
servant
appear
,
who
,
be
ask
if
Mrs.
Bennet
be
at
home
,
answer
,
with
some
confusion
in
her
countenance
,
that
she
do
not
know
;
"
<EOS>
but
,
madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
if
you
will
send
up
your
name
,
I
will
go
and
see
.
<EOS>
"
Amelia
then
tell
her
name
,
and
the
wench
,
after
stay
a
considerable
time
,
return
and
acquaint
her
that
Mrs.
Bennet
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
She
be
then
usher
into
a
parlour
and
tell
that
the
lady
would
wait
on
her
presently
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
parlour
Amelia
cool
her
heel
,
as
the
phrase
be
,
near
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
She
seem
,
indeed
,
at
this
time
,
in
the
miserable
situation
of
one
of
those
poor
wretch
who
make
their
morning
visit
to
the
great
to
solicit
favour
,
or
perhaps
to
solicit
the
payment
of
a
debt
,
for
both
be
alike
treat
as
beggar
,
and
the
latter
sometimes
consider
as
the
more
troublesome
beggar
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
during
her
stay
here
,
Amelia
observe
the
house
to
be
in
great
confusion
;
a
great
bustle
be
hear
above
-
stair
,
and
the
maid
run
up
and
down
several
time
in
a
great
hurry
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
Mrs.
Bennet
herself
come
in
.
<EOS>
She
be
greatly
disorder
in
her
look
,
and
have
,
as
the
woman
call
it
,
huddle
on
her
cloath
in
much
haste
;
for
,
in
truth
,
she
be
in
bed
when
Amelia
first
come
.
<EOS>
of
this
fact
she
inform
her
,
as
the
only
apology
she
could
make
for
have
cause
her
to
wait
so
long
for
her
company
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
very
readily
accept
her
apology
,
but
ask
her
with
a
smile
,
if
these
early
hour
be
usual
with
her
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
turn
as
red
as
scarlet
at
the
question
,
and
answer
,
"
no
,
indeed
,
dear
madam
.
<EOS>
I
be
for
the
most
part
a
very
early
riser
;
but
I
happen
accidentally
to
sit
up
very
late
last
night
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
little
expectation
of
your
intend
me
such
a
favour
this
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
look
very
steadfastly
at
her
,
say
,
"
be
it
possible
,
madam
<EOS>
,
you
should
think
such
a
note
as
this
would
raise
no
curiosity
in
me
?
"
<EOS>
She
then
give
her
the
note
,
ask
her
if
she
do
not
know
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
appear
in
the
utmost
surprize
and
confusion
at
this
instant
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
Amelia
have
conceive
but
the
slight
suspicion
before
,
the
behaviour
of
the
lady
would
have
be
a
sufficient
confirmation
to
her
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
She
wait
not
,
therefore
,
for
an
answer
,
which
,
indeed
,
the
other
seem
in
no
haste
to
give
,
but
conjure
her
in
the
most
earnest
manner
to
explain
to
her
the
meaning
of
so
extraordinary
an
act
of
friendship
;
"
for
so
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
esteem
it
,
be
convince
you
must
have
sufficient
reason
for
the
warning
you
have
give
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
,
after
some
hesitation
,
answer
,
"
I
need
not
,
I
believe
,
tell
you
how
much
I
be
surprize
at
what
you
have
shew
me
;
and
the
chief
reason
of
my
surprize
be
,
how
you
come
to
discover
my
hand
.
<EOS>
sure
,
madam
,
you
have
not
shew
it
to
Mrs.
Ellison
?
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
declare
she
have
not
,
but
desire
she
would
question
her
no
farther
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
signify
how
I
discover
it
,
since
your
hand
it
certainly
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
own
it
be
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Bennet
,
recover
her
spirit
,
"
and
since
you
have
not
shew
it
to
that
woman
<EOS>
I
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
guess
now
whence
you
may
have
your
information
;
but
no
matter
;
I
wish
I
have
never
do
anything
of
which
I
ought
to
be
more
ashamed
.
<EOS>
no
one
can
,
I
think
,
justly
accuse
me
of
a
crime
on
that
account
;
and
I
thank
Heaven
<EOS>
my
shame
will
never
be
direct
by
the
false
opinion
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
wrong
to
shew
my
letter
,
but
when
I
consider
all
circumstance
I
can
forgive
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
since
you
have
guess
the
truth
,
"
say
Amelia
,
"
I
be
not
oblige
to
deny
it
.
<EOS>
She
,
indeed
,
shew
me
your
letter
,
but
I
be
sure
you
have
not
the
least
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
it
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
your
behaviour
on
so
melancholy
an
occasion
be
highly
praiseworthy
;
and
your
bearing
up
under
such
affliction
as
the
loss
of
a
husband
in
so
dreadful
a
situation
be
truly
great
and
heroical
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
Mrs.
Ellison
then
hath
shew
you
my
letter
?
<EOS>
"
cry
Mrs.
Bennet
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
do
not
you
guess
it
yourself
?
"
answer
Amelia
;
"
otherwise
I
be
sure
I
have
betray
my
honour
in
mention
it
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
not
draw
me
inadvertently
into
any
breach
of
my
promise
.
<EOS>
do
you
not
assert
,
and
that
with
an
absolute
certainty
,
that
you
know
she
have
shew
me
your
letter
,
and
that
you
be
not
angry
with
her
for
so
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
confused
,
"
reply
Mrs.
Bennet
,
"
that
I
scarce
know
what
I
say
;
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
I
remember
I
do
say
<EOS>
so
 
I
wish
I
have
no
great
reason
to
be
angry
with
her
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
do
not
delay
my
request
any
longer
;
what
you
say
now
greatly
increase
my
curiosity
,
and
my
mind
will
be
on
the
rack
till
you
discover
your
whole
meaning
;
for
I
be
more
and
more
convinced
that
something
of
the
utmost
importance
be
the
purport
of
your
message
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
of
the
utmost
importance

indeed

cry
Mrs.
Bennet
;
"
at
least
you
will
own
my
apprehension
be
sufficiently
well
found
.
<EOS>
o
gracious
Heaven
!
<EOS>
how
happy
shall
I
think
myself
if
I
should
have
prove
your
preservation
!
<EOS>
I
will
,
indeed
,
explain
my
meaning
;
but
,
in
order
to
disclose
all
my
fear
in
their
just
colour
,
I
must
unfold
my
whole
history
to
you
.
<EOS>
Can
you
have
patience
,
madam
,
to
listen
to
the
story
of
the
most
unfortunate
of
woman
?

"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
assure
her
of
the
high
attention
,
and
Mrs.
Bennet
soon
after
begin
to
relate
what
be
write
in
the
seventh
book
of
this
history
.
    
<EOS>
BOOK
VII
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
short
chapter
,
and
consequently
require
no
preface
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
have
fasten
the
door
,
and
both
the
lady
have
take
their
place
,
she
once
or
twice
offer
to
speak
,
when
passion
stopt
her
utterance
;
and
,
after
a
minute
's
silence
,
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
.
<EOS>
upon
which
Amelia
,
express
the
utmost
tenderness
for
her
,
as
well
by
her
look
as
by
her
accent
,
cry
,
"
what
can
be
the
reason
,
dear
madam
,
of
all
this
emotion
?
"
<EOS>
"
o
,
Mrs.
Booth
!
<EOS>
"
answer
she
,
"
I
find
I
have
undertake
what
I
be
not
able
to
perform
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
wonder
at
my
emotion
if
you
know
you
have
an
adulteress
and
a
murderer
now
stand
before
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
turn
pale
as
death
at
these
word
,
which
Mrs.
Bennet
observe
,
collect
all
the
force
she
be
able
,
and
,
a
little
compose
her
countenance
,
cry
,
"
I
see
,
madam
,
I
have
terrify
you
with
such
dreadful
word
;
but
I
hope
you
will
not
think
me
guilty
of
these
crime
in
the
black
degree
.
"
<EOS>
"
guilty
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Amelia
.
"
<EOS>
o
Heavens
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
indeed
,
your
candour
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Bennet
,
"
will
be
ready
to
acquit
me
than
I
be
to
acquit
myself
.
<EOS>
indiscretion
,
at
least
,
the
high
,
most
unpardonable
indiscretion
<EOS>
,
I
shall
always
lay
to
ray
own
charge
:
<EOS>
and
,
when
I
reflect
on
the
fatal
consequence
,
I
can
never
,
never
forgive
myself
.
<EOS>
"
here
she
again
begin
to
lament
in
so
bitter
a
manner
,
that
Amelia
endeavour
,
as
much
as
she
could
(
for
she
be
herself
greatly
shock
)
,
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
;
tell
her
that
,
if
indiscretion
be
her
high
crime
,
the
unhappy
consequence
make
her
rather
an
unfortunate
than
a
guilty
person
;
and
conclude
by
say
 
"
indeed
,
madam
,
you
have
raise
my
curiosity
to
the
high
pitch
,
and
I
beg
you
will
proceed
with
your
story
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
then
seem
a
second
time
go
to
begin
her
relation
,
when
she
cry
out
,
"
I
would
,
if
possible
,
tire
you
with
no
more
of
my
unfortunate
life
than
just
with
that
part
which
lead
to
a
catastrophe
in
which
I
think
you
may
yourself
be
interested
;
but
I
protest
I
be
at
a
loss
where
to
begin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
begin
wherever
you
please
,
dear
madam
,
"
cry
Amelia
;
"
but
I
beg
you
will
consider
my
impatience
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
consider
it
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Bennet
;
"
and
therefore
would
begin
with
that
part
of
my
story
which
lead
directly
to
what
concern
yourself
;
for
how
,
indeed
,
should
my
life
produce
anything
worthy
your
notice
?
"
<EOS>
"
do
not
say
so
,
madam
,
"
cry
Amelia
;
"
I
assure
you
I
have
long
suspect
there
be
some
very
remarkable
incident
in
your
life
,
and
have
only
want
an
opportunity
to
impart
to
you
my
desire
of
hear
them
:
<EOS>
I
beg
,
therefore
,
you
would
make
no
more
apology
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
madam
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Bennet
,
"
and
yet
I
would
avoid
anything
trivial
;
though
,
indeed
,
in
story
of
distress
,
especially
where
love
be
concern
,
many
little
incident
may
appear
trivial
to
those
who
have
never
feel
the
passion
,
which
,
to
delicate
mind
,
be
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
whole
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
but
,
dear
madam
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
this
be
all
preface
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
madam
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Bennet
,
"
I
will
consider
your
impatience
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
rally
all
her
spirit
in
the
good
manner
she
could
,
and
begin
as
be
write
in
the
next
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
possibly
the
reader
will
blame
Mrs.
Bennet
for
take
her
story
so
far
back
,
and
relate
so
much
of
her
life
in
which
Amelia
have
no
concern
;
but
,
in
truth
,
she
be
desirous
of
inculcate
a
good
opinion
of
herself
,
from
recount
those
transaction
where
her
conduct
be
unexceptionable
,
before
she
come
to
the
more
dangerous
and
suspicious
part
of
her
character
.
<EOS>
this
I
really
suppose
to
have
be
her
intention
;
for
to
sacrifice
the
time
and
patience
of
Amelia
at
such
a
season
to
the
mere
love
of
talk
of
herself
would
have
be
as
unpardonable
in
her
as
the
bearing
it
be
in
Amelia
a
proof
of
the
most
perfect
good
breeding
.
    
<EOS>
the
beginning
of
Mrs.
Bennet
's
history
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
the
young
of
two
daughter
of
a
clergyman
in
Essex
;
of
one
in
whose
praise
if
I
should
indulge
my
fond
heart
in
speak
<EOS>
,
I
think
my
invention
could
not
outgo
the
reality
.
<EOS>
He
be
indeed
well
worthy
of
the
cloth
he
wear
;
and
that
,
I
think
,
be
the
high
character
a
man
can
obtain
.
  
<EOS>
"
during
the
first
part
of
my
life
,
even
till
I
reach
my
sixteenth
year
,
I
can
recollect
nothing
to
relate
to
you
.
<EOS>
all
be
one
long
serene
day
,
in
look
back
upon
which
,
as
when
we
cast
our
eye
on
a
calm
sea
,
no
object
arise
to
my
view
.
<EOS>
all
appear
one
scene
of
happiness
and
tranquillity
.
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
day
,
then
,
when
I
become
sixteen
year
old
,
must
I
begin
my
history
;
for
on
that
day
I
first
taste
the
bitterness
of
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
,
besides
those
prescribe
by
our
religion
,
keep
five
festival
every
year
.
<EOS>
these
be
on
his
wedding
-
day
,
and
on
the
birthday
of
each
of
his
little
family
;
on
these
occasion
he
use
to
invite
two
or
three
neighbour
to
his
house
,
and
to
indulge
himself
,
as
he
say
,
in
great
excess
;
for
so
he
call
drink
a
pint
of
very
small
punch
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
may
appear
excess
to
one
who
on
other
day
rarely
taste
any
liquor
strong
than
small
beer
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
unfortunate
birthday
,
then
,
when
we
be
all
in
a
high
degree
of
mirth
,
my
mother
have
leave
the
room
after
dinner
,
and
stay
away
pretty
long
,
my
father
send
me
to
see
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
go
accord
to
his
order
;
but
,
though
I
search
the
whole
house
and
call
after
her
without
door
,
I
could
neither
see
nor
hear
her
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
alarmed
at
this
(
though
far
from
suspect
any
great
mischief
have
befall
her
)
,
and
run
back
to
acquaint
my
father
,
who
answer
coolly
(
for
he
be
a
man
of
the
calm
temper
)
,
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
my
dear
,
I
suppose
she
be
not
go
far
,
and
will
be
here
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
half
an
hour
or
more
past
after
this
,
when
,
she
not
return
,
my
father
himself
express
some
surprize
at
her
stay
;
declare
it
must
be
some
matter
of
importance
which
could
detain
her
at
that
time
from
her
company
.
<EOS>
His
surprize
now
encrease
every
minute
,
and
he
begin
to
grow
uneasy
,
and
to
shew
sufficient
symptom
in
his
countenance
of
what
he
feel
within
.
<EOS>
He
then
despatch
the
servant
-
maid
to
enquire
after
her
mistress
in
the
parish
,
but
wait
not
her
return
;
for
she
be
scarce
go
out
of
door
before
he
beg
leave
of
his
guest
to
go
himself
on
the
same
errand
.
<EOS>
the
company
now
all
break
up
,
and
attend
my
father
,
all
endeavour
to
give
him
hope
that
no
mischief
have
happen
.
<EOS>
They
search
the
whole
parish
,
but
in
vain
;
they
could
neither
see
my
mother
,
nor
hear
any
news
of
her
.
<EOS>
My
father
return
home
in
a
state
little
short
of
distraction
.
<EOS>
His
friend
in
vain
attempt
to
administer
either
advice
or
comfort
;
he
throw
himself
on
the
floor
in
the
most
bitter
agony
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
whilst
he
lie
in
this
condition
,
my
sister
and
myself
lie
by
him
,
all
equally
,
I
believe
,
and
completely
miserable
,
our
old
servant
-
maid
come
into
the
room
and
cry
out
,
her
mind
misgave
her
that
she
know
where
her
mistress
be
.
<EOS>
upon
these
word
,
my
father
spring
from
the
floor
,
and
ask
her
eagerly
,
where
?
<EOS>
but
oh
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Booth
,
how
can
I
describe
the
particular
of
a
scene
to
you
,
the
remembrance
of
which
chill
my
blood
with
horror
,
and
which
the
agony
of
my
mind
,
when
it
past
,
make
all
a
scene
of
confusion
!
<EOS>
the
fact
then
in
short
be
this
:
my
mother
,
who
be
a
most
indulgent
mistress
to
one
servant
,
which
be
all
we
keep
,
be
unwilling
,
I
suppose
,
to
disturb
her
at
her
dinner
,
and
therefore
go
herself
to
fill
her
tea
-
kettle
at
a
well
,
into
which
,
stretch
herself
too
far
,
as
we
imagine
,
the
water
then
be
very
low
,
she
fall
with
the
tea
-
kettle
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
the
miss
this
give
the
poor
old
wretch
the
first
hint
of
her
suspicion
,
which
,
upon
examination
,
be
find
to
be
too
well
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
we
all
suffer
on
this
occasion
may
more
easily
be
feel
than
describe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
indeed
,
"
answer
Amelia
,
"
and
I
be
so
sensible
of
it
,
that
,
unless
you
have
a
mind
to
see
me
faint
before
your
face
,
I
beg
you
will
order
me
something
;
a
glass
of
water
,
if
you
please
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
immediately
comply
with
her
friend
's
request
;
a
glass
of
water
be
bring
,
and
some
hartshorn
drop
infuse
into
it
;
which
Amelia
have
drink
off
,
declare
she
find
herself
much
well
;
and
then
Mrs.
Bennet
proceed
thus
:
 
"
I
will
not
dwell
on
a
scene
which
I
see
hath
already
so
much
affect
your
tender
heart
,
and
which
be
as
disagreeable
to
me
to
relate
as
it
can
be
to
you
to
hear
.
<EOS>
I
will
therefore
only
mention
to
you
the
behaviour
of
my
father
on
this
occasion
,
which
be
indeed
become
a
philosopher
and
a
christian
divine
.
<EOS>
on
the
day
after
my
mother
's
funeral
he
send
for
my
sister
and
myself
into
his
room
,
where
,
after
many
caress
and
every
demonstration
of
fatherly
tenderness
as
well
in
silence
as
in
word
,
he
begin
to
exhort
us
to
bear
with
patience
the
great
calamity
that
have
befall
us
;
say
,
"
that
as
every
human
accident
,
how
terrible
soever
,
must
happen
to
us
by
divine
permission
at
least
,
a
due
sense
of
our
duty
to
our
great
Creator
must
teach
us
an
absolute
submission
to
his
will
.
<EOS>
not
only
religion
,
but
common
sense
,
must
teach
us
this
;
for
oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
child
,
"
cry
he
,
"
how
vain
be
all
resistance
,
all
repine
!
<EOS>
could
tear
wash
back
again
my
angel
from
the
grave
,
I
should
drain
all
the
juice
of
my
body
through
my
eye
;
but
oh
,
could
we
fill
up
that
curse
well
with
our
tear
,
how
fruitless
would
be
all
our
sorrow
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
repeat
you
his
very
word
;
for
the
impression
they
make
on
me
be
never
to
be
obliterate
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
comfort
us
with
the
chearful
think
that
the
loss
be
entirely
our
own
,
and
that
my
mother
be
greatly
a
gainer
by
the
accident
which
we
lament
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
wife
,
"
cry
he
,
"
my
child
,
and
you
have
a
mother
,
now
amongst
the
heavenly
choir
;
how
selfish
therefore
be
all
our
grief
!
<EOS>
how
cruel
to
her
be
all
our
wish
!
"
<EOS>
in
this
manner
he
talk
to
us
near
half
an
hour
,
though
I
must
frankly
own
to
you
<EOS>
his
argument
have
not
the
immediate
good
effect
on
us
which
they
deserve
,
for
we
retire
from
him
very
little
the
well
for
his
exhortation
;
however
,
they
become
every
day
more
and
more
forcible
upon
our
recollection
;
indeed
,
they
be
greatly
strengthen
by
his
example
;
for
in
this
,
as
in
all
other
instance
,
he
practise
the
doctrine
which
he
teach
.
<EOS>
from
this
day
he
never
mention
my
mother
more
,
and
soon
after
recover
his
usual
chearfulness
in
public
;
though
I
have
reason
to
think
he
pay
many
a
bitter
sigh
in
private
to
that
remembrance
which
neither
philosophy
nor
Christianity
could
expunge
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
's
advice
,
enforce
by
his
example
,
together
with
the
kindness
of
some
of
our
friend
,
assist
by
that
ablest
of
all
the
mental
physician
,
Time
,
in
a
few
month
pretty
well
restore
my
tranquillity
,
when
fortune
make
a
second
attack
on
my
quiet
.
<EOS>
My
sister
,
whom
I
dearly
love
,
and
who
as
warmly
return
my
affection
,
have
fall
into
an
ill
state
of
health
some
time
before
the
fatal
accident
which
I
have
relate
.
<EOS>
She
be
indeed
at
that
time
so
much
well
,
that
we
have
great
hope
of
her
perfect
recovery
;
but
the
disorder
of
her
mind
on
that
dreadful
occasion
so
affect
her
body
,
that
she
presently
relapse
to
her
former
decline
state
,
and
thence
grow
continually
bad
and
bad
,
till
,
after
a
decay
of
near
seven
month
,
she
follow
my
poor
mother
to
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
tire
you
,
dear
madam
,
with
repetition
of
grief
;
I
will
only
mention
two
observation
which
have
occur
to
me
from
reflection
on
the
two
loss
I
have
mention
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
,
that
a
mind
once
violently
hurt
grow
,
as
it
be
,
callous
to
any
future
impression
of
grief
,
and
be
never
capable
of
feel
the
same
pang
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
the
other
observation
be
,
that
the
arrow
of
fortune
,
as
well
as
all
other
,
derive
their
force
from
the
velocity
with
which
they
be
discharge
;
for
,
when
they
approach
you
by
slow
and
perceptible
degree
,
they
have
but
very
little
power
to

you
mischief

<EOS>
"
the
truth
of
these
observation
I
experience
,
not
only
in
my
own
heart
,
but
in
the
behaviour
of
my
father
,
whose
philosophy
seem
to
gain
a
complete
triumph
over
this
latter
calamity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
family
be
now
reduce
to
two
,
and
my
father
grow
extremely
fond
of
me
,
as
if
he
have
now
confer
an
entire
stock
of
affection
on
me
,
that
have
before
be
divide
.
<EOS>
His
word
,
indeed
,
testify
no
less
,
for
he
daily
call
me
his
only
darling
,
his
whole
comfort
,
his
all
.
<EOS>
He
commit
the
whole
charge
of
his
house
to
my
care
,
and
give
me
the
name
of
his
little
housekeeper
,
an
appellation
of
which
I
be
then
as
proud
as
any
minister
of
state
can
be
of
his
title
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
I
be
very
industrious
in
the
discharge
of
my
occupation
,
I
do
not
,
however
,
neglect
my
study
,
in
which
I
have
make
so
great
a
proficiency
,
that
I
be
become
a
pretty
good
mistress
of
the
latin
language
,
and
have
make
some
progress
in
the
Greek
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
madam
,
I
have
formerly
acquaint
you
,
that
learning
be
the
chief
estate
I
inherit
of
my
father
,
in
which
he
have
instruct
me
from
my
early
youth
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
kindness
of
this
good
man
have
at
length
wipe
off
the
remembrance
of
all
loss
;
and
I
during
two
year
lead
a
life
of
great
tranquillity
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
may
almost
say
of
perfect
happiness

<EOS>
"
I
be
now
.
<EOS>
in
the
nineteenth
year
of
my
age
,
when
my
father
's
good
fortune
remove
us
from
the
county
of
Essex
into
Hampshire
,
where
a
living
be
confer
on
him
by
one
of
his
old
school
-
fellow
,
of
twice
the
value
of
what
he
be
before
possess
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
predecessor
in
this
new
living
have
die
in
very
indifferent
circumstance
,
and
have
leave
behind
him
a
widow
with
two
small
child
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
therefore
,
who
,
with
great
economy
,
have
a
most
generous
soul
,
buy
the
whole
furniture
of
the
parsonage
-
house
at
a
very
high
price
;
some
of
it
,
indeed
,
he
would
have
want
;
for
,
though
our
little
habitation
in
Essex
be
most
completely
furnish
,
yet
it
bear
no
proportion
to
the
largeness
of
that
house
in
which
he
be
now
to
dwell
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
motive
,
however
,
to
the
purchase
be
,
I
be
convinced
,
solely
generosity
;
which
appear
sufficiently
by
the
price
he
give
,
and
may
be
farther
inforce
by
the
kindness
he
shew
the
widow
in
another
instance
;
for
he
assign
her
an
apartment
for
the
use
of
herself
and
her
little
family
,
which
,
he
tell
her
,
she
be
welcome
to
enjoy
as
long
as
it
suit
her
conveniency
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
this
widow
be
very
young
,
and
generally
think
to
be
tolerably
pretty
,
though
I
own
she
have
a
cast
with
her
eye
which
I
never
like
,
my
father
,
you
may
suppose
,
act
from
a
less
noble
principle
than
I
have
hint
;
but
I
must
in
justice
acquit
him
,
for
these
kind
offer
be
make
her
before
ever
he
have
see
her
face
;
and
I
have
the
great
reason
to
think
that
,
for
a
long
time
after
he
have
see
her
,
he
behold
her
with
much
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
act
of
my
father
's
give
me
,
when
I
first
hear
it
,
great
satisfaction
;
for
I
may
at
least
,
with
the
modesty
of
the
ancient
philosopher
,
call
myself
a
lover
of
generosity
,
but
when
I
become
acquaint
with
the
widow
I
be
still
more
delighted
with
what
my
father
have
do
;
for
though
I
could
not
agree
with
those
who
think
her
a
consummate
beauty
,
I
must
allow
that
she
be
very
fully
possess
of
the
power
of
make
herself
agreeable
;
and
this
power
she
exert
with
so
much
success
,
with
such
indefatigable
industry
to
oblige
,
that
within
three
month
I
become
in
the
high
manner
please
with
my
new
acquaintance
,
and
have
contract
the
most
sincere
friendship
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
if
I
be
so
pleased
with
the
widow
,
my
father
be
by
this
time
enamour
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
indeed
,
by
the
most
artful
conduct
in
the
world
,
so
insinuate
herself
into
his
favour
,
so
entirely
infatuate
him
,
that
he
never
shew
the
least
mark
of
chearfulness
in
her
absence
,
and
could
,
in
truth
,
scarce
bear
that
she
should
be
out
of
his
sight
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
manage
this
matter
<EOS>
so
well
<EOS>
(
o
,
she
be
the
most
artful
of
woman

<EOS>
that
my
father
's
heart
be
go
before
I
ever
suspect
it
be
in
danger
.
<EOS>
the
discovery
you
may
easily
believe

madam
,
be
not
pleasing
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
a
mother
-
in
-
law
sound
dreadful
in
my
ear
;
nor
could
I
bear
the
thought
of
part
again
with
a
share
in
those
dear
affection
,
of
which
I
have
purchase
the
whole
by
the
loss
of
a
beloved
mother
and
sister

<EOS>
"
in
the
first
hurry
and
disorder
of
my
mind
on
this
occasion
I
commit
a
crime
of
the
high
kind
against
all
the
law
of
prudence
and
discretion
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
young
lady
herself
very
roundly
to
task
,
treat
her
design
on
my
father
as
little
well
than
a
design
to
commit
a
theft
,
and
in
my
passion
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
say
she
may
be
ashamed
to
think
of
marry
a
man
old
enough
to
be
her
grandfather
;
for
so
in
reality
he
almost
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
lady
on
this
occasion
act
finely
the
part
of
a
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
She
affect
to
be
highly
affront
at
my
unjust
suspicion
,
as
she
call
them
;
and
proceed
to
such
asseveration
of
her
innocence
,
that
she
almost
bring
me
to
discredit
the
evidence
of
my
own
eye
and
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
,
however
,
act
much
more
honestly
,
for
he
fall
the
next
day
into
a
more
violent
passion
with
me
than
I
have
ever
see
him
in
before
,
and
ask
me
whether
I
intend
to
return
his
paternal
fondness
by
assume
the
right
of
control
his
inclination
?
<EOS>
with
more
of
the
like
kind
,
which
fully
convince
me
what
have
pass
between
him
and
the
lady
,
and
how
little
I
have
injure
her
in
my
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hitherto
,
I
frankly
own
,
my
aversion
to
this
match
have
be
principally
on
my
own
account
;
for
I
have
no
ill
opinion
of
the
woman
,
though
I
think
neither
her
circumstance
nor
my
father
's
age
promise
any
kind
of
felicity
from
such
an
union
;
but
now
I
learn
some
particular
,
which
,
have
not
our
quarrel
become
public
in
the
parish
,
I
should
perhaps
have
never
know
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
be
inform
that
this
gentle
obliging
creature
,
as
she
have
at
first
appear
to
me
,
have
the
spirit
of
a
tigress
,
and
be
by
many
believe
to
have
break
the
heart
of
her
first
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
truth
of
this
matter
be
confirm
to
me
upon
examination
,
I
resolve
not
to
suppress
it
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
fortune
seem
to
favour
me
,
by
give
me
a
speedy
opportunity
of
see
my
father
alone
and
in
good
humour
.
<EOS>
He
now
first
begin
to
open
his
intended
marriage
,
tell
me
that
he
have
formerly
have
some
religious
objection
to
bigamy
,
but
he
have
very
fully
consider
the
matter
,
and
have
satisfy
himself
of
its
legality
.
<EOS>
He
then
faithfully
promise
me
that
no
second
marriage
should
in
the
least
impair
his
affection
for
me
;
and
conclude
with
the
high
eulogium
on
the
goodness
of
the
widow
,
protest
that
it
be
her
virtue
and
not
her
person
with
which
he
be
enamour
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
fall
upon
my
knee
before
him
,
and
bathe
his
hand
in
my
tear
,
which
flow
very
plentifully
from
my
eye
,
acquaint
him
with
all
I
have
hear
,
and
be
so
very
imprudent
,
I
may
almost
say
so
cruel
,
to
disclose
the
author
of
my
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
hear
me
without
any
indication
of
passion
,
and
answer
coldly
,
that
if
there
be
any
proof
of
such
fact
he
should
decline
any
further
thought
of
this
match
:
"
but
,
child
,
"
say
he
,
"
though
I
be
far
from
suspect
the
truth
of
what
you
tell
me
,
as
far
as
regard
your
knowledge
,
yet
you
know
the
inclination
of
the
world
to
slander
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
before
we
part
he
promise
to
make
a
proper
enquiry
into
what
I
have
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
ask
your
pardon
,
dear
madam
,
I
be
run
minutely
into
those
particular
of
my
life
in
which
you
have
not

concern

Amelia

her

short
in

apology

,
perhaps
,
she

her
impertinent
enough

she
give

enquire
farther
into

affair

hardly
time
to
keep
his
word

late
in

evening

early

,
though

give
no
credit
to
my
information

I
have
sufficient
reason
to
think

do
not
forget
it

by
the
resentment
which
he
soon
discover
to
both
the
person

I

name

my
informer

perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
good
opinion
I
have
of
her
,
not
only
from
her
usage
of
me

from
certain
hint
which
she
throw
forth
with
an
air
of
triumph

<EOS>
one
day
,
particularly
,
I
remember
she
say
to
my
father
,
upon
his
mention
his
age
,
"
o

my
dear

I
hope
you
have
many
year
yet
to
live

so
cruel
as
to
break
your
heart

She
speak
these
word
look
me
full
in

face

and
accompany
them
with
a
sneer
in
which
the
high
malice

visible

under
a
thin
covering
of
affect
pleasantry

I
will
not
entertain
you
,
madam

with
anything
so
common
as
the
cruel
usage
of
a
step

mother

nor
of
what
affect
me
much
more

the
unkind
behaviour
of
a
father
under
such
an
influence

<EOS>
It
shall
suffice
only
to
tell
you
that
I
have
the
mortification
to
perceive
the
gradual
and
daily
decrease
of
my
father

affection

His
smile
be
convert
into
frown

the
tender
appellation
of
child

dear

exchange
for
plain
Molly

that
girl

that
creature

sometimes
much
hard

one
day
into

up

at
the

time
give
me
a
letter

would

letter

before
I
mention
the
content
I
will
give
you
a
short
sketch
of
her
character

as
it
be
somewhat
particular

<EOS>
Her
personal
charm
be
not
great

for
she
be
very
tall
,
very
thin
,
and
very
homely
.
<EOS>
of
the
defect
of
her
beauty
<EOS>
she
be
,
perhaps
,
sensible
;
<EOS>
her
vanity
,
therefore
,
retreat
into
her
mind
,
where
there
be
no
looking
-
glass
,
and
consequently
where
we
can
flatter
ourselves
with
discover
almost
whatever
beauty
we
please
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
encourage
circumstance
;
and
yet
I
have
observe
,
<EOS>
dear
Mrs.
Booth
,
that
few
woman
ever
seek
these
comfort
from
within
till
they
be
drive
to
it
by
despair
of
find
any
food
for
their
vanity
from
without

<EOS>
indeed
,
I
believe
the
first
wish
of
our
whole
sex
be
to
be
handsome
.

both

their
eye

this
to
such
a
pitch
,
that
at
the
age
of
fifty
,
at
which
she
be
now
arrive

she
have
contract
a
hearty
contempt
for
much
the
great
part
of
both
sex
;
for
the
woman
,
as
be
idiot
,
and
for
the
man
,
as
the
admirer
of
idiot
.
<EOS>
that
word
,
and
fool
,
be
almost
constantly
in
her
mouth

be
bestow
with
great
liberality
among
all
her
acquaintance

<EOS>
"
this
lady
have
spend
one
day
only
at
my
father
's
house
in
near
two
year
;
it
be
about
a
month
before
his
second
marriage
.
<EOS>
at
her
departure
she
take
occasion
to
whisper
me
her
opinion
of
the
widow
,
whom
she
call
a
pretty
idiot
,
and
wonder
how
her
brother
could
bear
such
company
under
his
roof
;
for
neither
she
nor
I
have
at
that
time
any
suspicion
of
what
afterwards
happen
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
letter
which
my
father
have
just
receive
,
and
which
be
the
first
she
have
send
him
since
his
marriage
,
be
of
such
a
nature
that
I
should
be
unjust
if
I
blame
him
for
be
offend
;
fool
and
idiot
be
both
plentifully
bestow
in
it
as
well
on
himself
as
on
his
wife
.
<EOS>
but
what
,
perhaps
,
have
principally
offend
him
<EOS>
be
that
part
which
relate
to
me
;
for
,
after
much
panegyric
on
my
understanding
,
and
say
he
be
unworthy
of
such
a
daughter
,
she
consider
his
match
not
only
as
the
high
indiscretion
as
it
relate
to
himself
,
but
as
a
downright
act
of
injustice
to
me
.
<EOS>
one
expression
in
it
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
place
,
"
say
she
,
"
a
woman
above
your
daughter
,
who
,
in
understanding
,
the
only
valuable
gift
of
nature
,
be
the
low
in
the
whole
class
of
pretty
idiot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
much
more
of
this
kind
,
it
conclude
with
invite
me
to
her
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
truly
say
that
when
I
have
read
the
letter
I
entirely
forgave
my
father
's
suspicion
that
I
have
make
some
complaint
to
my
aunt
of
his
behaviour
;
for
,
though
I
be
indeed
innocent
,
there
be
surely
colour
enough
to
suspect
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
"
though
I
have
never
be
greatly
attach
to
my
aunt
,
nor
indeed
have
she
formerly
give
me
any
reason
for
such
an
attachment
,
yet
I
be
well
enough
pleased
with
her
present
invitation
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
lead
<EOS>
so
wretche
a
life
where
I
then
be
,
that
it
be
impossible
not
to
be
a
gainer
by
any
exchange
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
,
however
,
bear
the
thought
of
leave
my
father
with
an
impression
on
his
mind
against
me
which
I
do
not
deserve
.
<EOS>
I
endeavour
,
therefore
,
to
remove
all
his
suspicion
of
my
have
complain
to
my
aunt
by
the
most
earnest
asseveration
of
my
innocence
;
but
they
be
all
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
all
my
tear
,
all
my
vow
,
and
all
my
entreaty
be
fruitless
.
<EOS>
My
new
mother
,
indeed
,
appear
to
be
my
advocate
;
but
she
act
her
part
very
poorly
,
and
,
far
from
counterfeit
any
desire
of
succeed
in
my
suit
,
she
could
not
conceal
the
excessive
joy
which
she
feel
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
madam
,
the
next
day
I
depart
for
my
aunt
's
,
where
,
after
a
long
journey
of
forty
mile
,
I
arrive
,
without
have
once
break
my
fast
on
the
road
;
for
grief
be
as
capable
as
food
of
fill
the
stomach
,
and
I
have
too
much
of
the
former
to
admit
any
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
the
fatigue
of
my
journey
,
and
the
agitation
of
my
mind
,
join
to
my
fasting
,
so
overpower
my
spirit
,
that
when
I
be
take
from
my
horse
I
immediately
faint
away
in
the
arm
of
the
man
who
help
me
from
my
saddle
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
express
great
astonishment
at
see
me
in
this
condition
,
with
my
eye
almost
swollen
out
of
my
head
with
tear
;
but
my
father
's
letter
,
which
I
deliver
her
soon
after
I
come
to
myself
,
pretty
well

,
I
believe
,
cure
her
surprize
.
<EOS>
She
often
smile
with
a
mixture
of
contempt
and
anger
while
she
be
read
it
;
and
,
have
pronounce
her
brother
to
be
a
fool
,
she
turn
to
me
,
and
,
with
as
much
affability
as
possible
(
for
she
be
no
great
mistress
of
affability
)
,
say
,
"
do
not
be
uneasy
,
dear
<EOS>
Molly
,
for
you
be
come
to
the
house
of
a
friend
 
of
one
who
hath
sense
enough
to
discern
the
author
of
all
the
mischief

depend
upon
it

I
will
,
ere
long
,
make
some
people
ashamed
of
their
folly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
kind
reception
give
me
some
comfort
,
my
aunt
assure
me
that
she
would
convince
him
how
unjustly
he
have
accuse
me
of
have
make
any
complaint
to
her
.
<EOS>
a
paper
war
be
now
begin
between
these
two
,
which
not
only
fix
an
irreconcileable
hatred
between
them
,
but
confirm
my
father
's
displeasure
against
me
;
and
,
in
the
end
,
I
believe
,
do
me
no
service
with
my
aunt
;
for
I
be
consider
by
both
as
the
cause
of
their
dissension
,
though
,
in
fact
,
my
stepmother
,
who
very
well
know
the
affection
my
aunt
have
for
her
,
have
long
since
do
her
business
with
my
father
;
and
as
for
my
aunt
's
affection
towards
him
,
it
have
be
abate
several
year
,
from
an
apprehension
that
he
do
not
pay
sufficient
deference
to
her
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
live
about
half
a
year
with
my
aunt
when
I
hear
of
my
stepmother
's
be
deliver
of
a
boy
,
and
the
great
joy
my
father
express
on
that
occasion
;
but
,
poor
man
,
he
live
not
long
to
enjoy
his
happiness
;
for
within
a
month
afterwards
I
have
the
melancholy
news
of
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
"
notwithstanding
all
the
disobligation
I
have
lately
receive
from
him

I
be
sincerely
afflict
at
my
loss
of
him

<EOS>
all
his
kindness
to
me
in
my
infancy

all
his
kindness
to
me

I

grow
up

recur
to
my
memory

raise
a
thousand
tender

melancholy
idea

totally
obliterate
all
thought
of
his
latter
behaviour
,
for
which
I
make
also
every
allowance
and
every
excuse
in
my
power

<EOS>
"
but
what
may
perhaps
appear
more
extraordinary
,
my
aunt
begin
soon
to
speak
of
him
with
concern
.
<EOS>
She
say
he
have
some
understanding
formerly
,
though
his
passion
for
that
vile
woman
have
,
in
a
great
measure
,
obscure
it
;
and
one
day
,
when
she
be
in
an
ill
-
humour
with
me
,
she
have
the
cruelty
to
throw
out
a
hint
that
she
have
never
quarrel
with
her
brother
if
it
have
not
be
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
,
during
his
life
,
have
allow
my
aunt
very
handsomely
for
my
board
;
for
generosity
be
too
deeply
riveted
in
his
nature
to
be
pluck
out
by
all
the
power
of
his
wife

so
far

though
he
die
possess
of
upward
of
L2000
,
he
leave
me
no
more
than
L100

which
,
as
he
express
in
his
will
,
be
to
set
me
up
in
some
business
,
if
I
have
the
grace
to
take
to
any
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hitherto
my
aunt
have
in
general
treat
me
with
some
degree
of
affection
;
but
her
behaviour
begin
now
to
be
change
.
<EOS>
She
soon
take
an
opportunity
of
give
me
to
understand
that
her
fortune
be
insufficient
to
keep
me
;
and
,
as
I
could
not
live
on
the
interest
of
my
own
,
it
be
high
time
for
me
to
consider
about
go
into
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
add
,
that
her
brother
have
mention
my
setting
up
in
some
business
in
his
will
be
very
foolish
;
that
I
have
be
breed
to
nothing
;
and
,
besides
,
that
the
sum
be
too
trifling
to
set
me
up
in
any
way
of
reputation
;
she
desire
me
therefore
to
think
of
immediately
go
into
service
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
advice
be
perhaps
right
enough
;
and
I
tell
her
I
be
very
ready
to
do
as
she
direct
me
,
but
I
be
at
that
time
in
an
ill
state
of
health

I
desire
her
therefore
to

me
stay
with
her

legacy

not

till
a

I

promise
to
satisfy
her
for

which
she
readily
consent

"
the
curate
of

four

twenty

He
have
be
leave
an
orphan
in
his

entirely
unprovided

goodness
to
take
care
of
his

both
at

no
very
large
fortune

purchase
for
him
the
next
presentation
of
a
living
of
near
L200
a

year

<EOS>
the
incumbent
,
at
the
time
of
the
purchase

be
under
the
age
of
sixty
,
and
in
apparent
good
health
;
notwithstanding
which
,
he
die
soon
after
the
bargain

long
before

,
I
be
sure
,
have
feel
the
same
?
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
smile
,
and
Mrs.
Bennet
go
on
thus
:
"
o
,
Mrs.
Booth
!
<EOS>
have
you
see
the
person
of
whom
I
be
now
speak
,
you
would
not
condemn
the
suddenness
of
my
love
.
<EOS>
nay
,
indeed
,
I
have
see
him
there
before
,
though
this
be
the
first
time
I
have
ever
hear
the
music
of
his
voice
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
be
the
sweetest
that
be
ever
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bennet
come
to
visit
my
aunt
the
very
next
day
.
<EOS>
She
impute
this
respectful
haste
to
the
powerful
charm
of
her
understanding
,
and
resolve
to
lose
no
opportunity
in
improve
the
opinion
which
she
imagine
he
have
conceive
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
become
by
this
desire
quite
ridiculous
,
and
run
into
absurdity
and
a
gallimatia
scarce
credible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bennet
,
as
I
afterwards
find
,
see
her
in
the
same
light
with
myself
;
but
,
as
he
be
a
very
sensible
and
well
-
breed
man
,
he
so
well
conceal
his
opinion
from
us
both
,
that
I
be
almost
angry
,
and
she
be
pleased
even
to
rapture
,
declare
herself
charm
with
his
understanding
,
though
<EOS>
,
indeed
,
he
have
say
very
little
;
but
I
believe
he
hear
himself
into
her
good
opinion
,
while
he
gaze
himself
into
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
two
first
visit
which
Mr.
Bennet
make
to
my
aunt
,
though
I
be
in
the
room
all
the
time
,
I
never
speak
a
word
;
but
on
the
third
,
on
some
argument
which
arise
between
them
,
Mr.
Bennet
refer
himself
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
take
his
side
of
the
question
,
as
indeed
I
must
to
have
do
justice
,
and
repeat
two
or
three
word
of
Latin
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
redden
at
this
,
and
expr
great
disdain
of
my
opinion
,
declare
she
be
astonish
that
a
man
of
Mr.
Bennet
's
understanding
could
appeal
to
the
judgment
of
a
silly
girl
;
"
be
she
,
"
say
my
aunt
,
bridle
herself
,
"
fit
to
decide
between
us
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bennet
speak
very
favourably
of
what
I
have
say
;
upon
which
my
aunt
burst
almost
into
a
rage
,
treat
me
with
downright
scurrility
,
call
me
conceited
fool
,
abuse
my
poor
father
for
have
teach
me
Latin
,
which
,
she
say
,
have
make
me
a
downright
coxcomb
,
and
make
me
prefer
myself
to
those
who
be
a
hundred
time
my
superior
in
knowledge
.
<EOS>
She
then
fall
foul
on
the
learned
language
,
declare
they
be
totally
useless
,
and
conclude
that
she
have
read
all
that
be
worth
reading
,
though
,
she
thank
heaven
,
she
understand
no
language
but
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
before
the
end
of
this
visit
Mr.
Bennet
reconcile
himself
very
well
to
my
aunt
,
which
,
indeed
,
be
no
difficult
task
for
him
to
accomplish
;
but
from
that
hour
she
conceive
a
hatred
and
rancour
towards
me
which
I
could
never
appease
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
have
,
from
my
first
come
into
her
house
,
express
great
dislike
to
my
learning
.
<EOS>
in
plain
truth
,
she
envy
me
that
advantage
.
<EOS>
this
envy
I
have
long
ago
discover
,
and
have
take
great
pain
to
smother
it
,
carefully
avoid
ever
to
mention
a
latin
word
in
her
presence
,
and
always
submit
to
her
authority
;
for
indeed
I
despise
her
ignorance
too
much
to
dispute
with
her
.
<EOS>
by
these
mean
I
have
pretty
well
succeed
,
and
we
live
tolerably
together
;
but
the
affront
pay
to
her
understanding
by
Mr.
Bennet
in
my
favour
<EOS>
be
an
injury
never
to
be
forgive
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
take
me
severely
to
task
that
very
evening
,
and
remind
me
of
go
to
service
in
such
earnest
term
as
almost
amount
to
literally
turn
me
out
of
door
;
advise
me
,
in
the
most
insulting
manner
,
to
keep
my
Latin
to
myself
,
which
she
say
be
useless
to
any
one
,
but
ridiculous
when
pretend
to
by
a
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
next
visit
Mr.
Bennet
make
at
our
house
<EOS>
I
be
not
suffer
to
be
present
.
<EOS>
this
be
much
the
short
of
all
his
visit
;
and
when
he
go
away
he
leave
my
aunt
in
a
bad
humour
than
ever
I
have
see
her
.
<EOS>
the
whole
be
discharge
on
me
in
the
usual
manner
,
by
upbraid
me
with
my
learning
,
conceit
,
and
poverty
;
remind
me
of
obligation
,
and
insist
on
my
go
immediately
to
service
.
<EOS>
with
all
this
I
be
greatly
pleased
,
as
it
assure
me
that
Mr.
Bennet
have
say
something
to
her
in
my
favour
;
and
I
would
have
purchase
a
kind
expression
of
his
at
almost
any
price
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
scarce
,
however
,
have
be
so
sanguine
as
to
draw
this
conclusion
<EOS>
,
have
I
not
receive
some
hint
that
I
have
not
unhappily
place
my
affection
on
a
man
who
make
me
no
return
;
for
,
though
he
have
scarce
address
a
dozen
sentence
to
me
(
for
,
indeed
,
he
have
no
opportunity
)
,
yet
his
eye
have
reveal
certain
secret
to
mine
with
which
I
be
not
displeased
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remain
,
however
,
in
a
state
of
anxiety
near
a
month
;
sometimes
please
myself
with
think
Mr.
Bennet
's
heart
be
in
the
same
situation
with
my
own
;
sometimes
doubt
that
my
wish
have
flatter
and
deceive
me
,
and
not
in
the
least
questioning
that
my
aunt
be
my
rival
;
for
I
think
no
woman
could
be
proof
against
the
charm
that
have
subdue
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mrs.
Booth
,
he
be
a
charming
young
fellow
;
I
must
 
<EOS>
I
must
pay
this
tribute
to
his
memory
.
<EOS>
o
,
gracious
Heaven
!
<EOS>
why
,
why
do
I
ever
see
him
?
<EOS>
why
be
I
doom
to
such
misery
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
,
and
remain
incapable
of
speech
for
some
time
;
during
which
the
gentle
Amelia
endeavour
all
she
could
to
soothe
her
,
and
give
sufficient
mark
of
sympathizing
in
the
tender
affliction
of
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
,
at
length
,
recover
her
spirit
,
and
proceed
,
as
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
the
story
of
Mrs.
Bennet
continue
.
 
<EOS>
I
scarce
know
where
I
leave
off
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
be
,
I
think
,
tell
you
that
I
esteem
my
aunt
as
my
rival
;
and
it
be
not
easy
to
conceive
a
great
degree
of
detestation
than
I
have
for
her
;
and
what
may
,
perhaps
,
appear
strange
,
as
she
daily
grow
more
and
more
civil
to
me
,
my
hatred
encrease
with
her
civility
;
for
I
impute
it
all
to
her
triumph
over
me
,
and
to
her
have
secure
,
beyond
all
apprehension
,
the
heart
I
long
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
I
surprize
when
,
one
day
,
with
as
much
good
-
humour
as
she
be
mistress
of
(
for
her
countenance
be
not
very
pleasing
)
,
she
ask
me
how
I
like
Mr.
Bennet
?
<EOS>
the
question
,
you
will
believe
,
madam
,
throw
me
into
great
confusion
,
which
she
plainly
perceive
,
and
,
without
wait
for
my
answer
,
tell
me
she
be
very
well
satisfied
,
for
that
it
do
not
require
her
discernment
to
read
my
thought
in
my
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
child
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
have
suspect
this
a
great
while
,
and
I
believe
it
will
please
you
to
know
that
I
yesterday
make
the
same
discovery
in
your
lover
.
<EOS>
"
this
,
I
confess
to
you
,
be
more
than
I
could
well
bear
,
and
I
beg
her
to
say
no
more
to
me
at
that
time
on
that
subject
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
child
,
"
answer
she
,
"
I
must
tell
you
all
,
or
I
should
not
act
a
friendly
part
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bennet
,
I
be
convince
,
hath
a
passion
for
you
;
but
it
be
a
passion
which
,
I
think
,
you
should
not
encourage
.
<EOS>
for
,
to
be
plain
with
you

I
fear
he
be
in
love
with
your
person
only

now
this
be
a
love
,
child
,
which
can
not
produce
that
rational
happiness
which
a
woman
of
sense
ought
to
expect
.
<EOS>
"
in
short
,
she
run
on
with
a
great
deal
of
stuff
about
rational
happiness
,
and
woman
of
sense
,
and
conclude
with
assure
me
that
,
after
the
strict
scrutiny
,
she
could
not
find
that
Mr.
Bennet
have
an
adequate
opinion
of
my
understanding
;
upon
which
she
vouchsafe
to
make
me
many
compliment
,
but
mix
with
several
sarcasm
concern
my
learning
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
madam
,
however
,
"
say
she
to
Amelia
<EOS>
,
"
you
have
not
so
bad
an
opinion
of
my
capacity
as
to
imagine
me
dull
enough
to
be
offend
with
Mr.
Bennet
's
sentiment
,
for
which
I
presently
know
so
well
to
account
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
indeed
,
charm
with
his
ingenuity

who
have
discover
,
perhaps
,
the
only
way
of
reconcile
my
aunt
to
those
inclination
which
I
now
assure
myself
he
have
for
me

"
I
be
not
long
leave
to
support
my
hope

my
sagacity

<EOS>
He
soon
find
an
opportunity
of
declare
his
passion

<EOS>
He
do
this
in
so
forcible
though
gentle
a
manner
,
with
such
a
profusion
of
fervency
and
tenderness
at
once
,
that
his
love
,
like
a
torrent
,
bore
everything
before
it

I
be
almost
ashamed
to
own
to
you
<EOS>
how
very
soon
he
prevail
upon
me
to
 
to
 
in
short
,
to
be
an
honest
woman
,
and
to
confess
to
him
the
plain
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
we
be
upon
a
good
footing
together
he
give
me
a
long
relation
of
what
have
past
at
several
interview
with
my
aunt
,
at
which
I
have
not
be
present
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
discover
that
,
as
she
value
herself
chiefly
on
her
understanding
,
so
she
be
extremely
jealous
of
mine
,
and
hate
me
on
account
of
my
learning
.
<EOS>
that
,
as
he
have
love
me
passionately
from
his
first
see
me
,
and
have
think
of
nothing
from
that
time
but
of
throw
himself
at
my
foot

he
see
no
way
so
open
to
propitiate
my
aunt
as
that
which
he
have
take
by
commend
my
beauty
,
a
perfection
to
which
she
have
long
resign
all
claim
,
at
the
expense
of
my
understanding
,
in
which
he
lament
my
deficiency
to
a
degree
almost
of
ridicule
.
<EOS>
this
he
impute
chiefly
to
my
learning
;
on
this
occasion
he
advance
a
sentiment
which
so
please
my
aunt
that
she
think
proper
to
make
it
her
own
;
for
I
hear
it
afterwards
more
than
once
from
her
own
mouth
.
<EOS>
learning
,
he
say
,
have
the
same
effect
on
the
mind
that
strong
liquor
have
on
the
constitution
;
both
tend
to
eradicate
all
our
natural
fire
and
energy
.
<EOS>
His
flattery
have
make
such
a
dupe
of
my
aunt
that
she
assent
,
without
the
least
suspicion
of
his
sincerity
,
to
all
he
say
;
so
sure
be
vanity
to
weaken
every
fortress
of
the
understanding
,
and
to
betray
us
to
every
attack
of
the
enemy

<EOS>
"
You
will
believe

madam

that
I
readily
forgave
him
all
he
have
say

not
only
from
that
motive

I
have
mention

I
be
assure

speak
the
reverse

extraordinary

fatal
consequence

a
sentence

doate
on
to
distraction

little
difficulty

persuade
me
to
a
proposal

indeed

I

generous
in

tenderness

ascribe
it

proceed

no

be
always
easy
enough
to
do
amongst
the
vulgar
against
person
who
be
their
superior
in
rank
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
their
inferior
in
fortune
.
<EOS>
this
make
Mr.
Bennet
think
of
procure
an
exchange
,
in
which
intention
he
be
soon
after
confirm
by
the
arrival
of
the
rector
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
rector
's
custom
to
spend
three
month
every
year
at
his
living
,
for
which
purpose
he
reserve
an
apartment
in
his
parsonage
-
house
,
which
be
full
large
enough
for
two
such
little
family
as
then
occupy
it
.
<EOS>
We
at
first
promise
ourselves
some
little
convenience
from
his
boarding
with
us
;
and
Mr.
Bennet
begin
to
lay
aside
his
thought
of
leave
his
curacy
,
at
least
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
but
these
golden
idea
presently
vanish
;
for
,
though
we
both
use
our
utmost
endeavour
to
please
him
,
we
soon
find
the
impossibility
of
succeed
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
to
give
you
his
character
in
a
word
,
the
most
peevish
of
mortal
.
<EOS>
this
temper
,
notwithstanding
that
he
be
both
a
good
and
a
pious
man
,
make
his
company
so
insufferable
that
nothing
could
compensate
it
.
<EOS>
if
his
breakfast
be
not
ready
to
a
moment
 
if
a
dish
of
meat
be
too
much
or
too
little
do
 
in
short
,
if
anything
fail
of
exactly
hit
his
taste
,
he
be
sure
to
be
out
of
humour
all
that
day
,
so
that
,
indeed
,
he
be
scarce
ever
in
a
good
temper
a
whole
day
together
;
for
fortune
seem
to
take
a
delight
in
thwart
this
kind
of
disposition
,
to
which
human
life
,
with
its
many
crosse
and
accident
,
be
,
in
truth
,
by
no
means
fit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bennet
be
now
,
by
my
desire
as
well
as
his
own
,
determine
to
quit
the
parish
;
but
when
he
attempt
to
get
an
exchange
,
he
find
it
a
matter
of
more
difficulty
than
he
have
apprehend
;
for
the
rector
's
temper
be
so
well
known
among
the
neighbour
clergy
,
that
none
of
them
could
be
bring
to
think
of
spend
three
month
in
a
year
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
many
fruitless
enquiry
,
Mr.
Bennet
think
best
to
remove
to
London
,
the
great
mart
of
all
affair
,
ecclesiastical
and
civil
.
<EOS>
this
project
greatly
please
him
,
and
he
resolve
,
without
more
delay
,
to
take
his
leave
of
the
rector
,
which
he
do
in
the
most
friendly
manner
possible
,
and
preach
his
farewell
sermon
;
nor
be
there
a
dry
eye
in
the
church

except
among
the
few

my
aunt

remain
still
inexorable

prevail
upon
to
hate
us
without
any
cause

to

come

take
up

so
many
valuable

It

be
go
out

casually
intercept

approach
to

how

cruel

to
relieve
the
uneasiness

my

false

prevail
with
him
to
go
every
night

almost
for
a
fortnight
together

to
the

a
diversion
of

fond

from
which

very
well

those
austere

him

however
innocent
diversion
may
be
in
other
respect

must
be
own

you
consider
then

that
our
income
from
the
curacy

less
than
forty
pound
a
year

that

payment
of
the
debt

two
thing

now

occasion
much
serious
reflexion

that
I

the
other

forty
pound

I
mention

former
of
these

a
pretence

a
delay

the
payment
of
the
latter

in
two

off
half
the

of
a

should
in
reality
have
encrease
our
concern

on
the

it
give

great
pleasure

great
indeed
could
not

conceive
at

yet
,
if
we
consider
the
interest
of
that
little
wretch

since
see
in
your
company
.
<EOS>
this
lord
,
Mrs.
Ellison
tell
me
,
have
take
a
great
fancy
to
my
little
Charley
.
<EOS>
fool
that
I
be
,
and
blind
by
my
own
passion
,
which
make
me
conceive
that
an
infant
,
not
three
month
old
,
could
be
really
the
object
of
affection
to
any
besides
a
parent
,
and
more
especially
to
a
gay
young
fellow
!
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
be
silly
in
be
deceive
,
how
wicked
be
the
wretch
who
deceive
me
 
who
use
such
art
,
and
employ
such
pain
,
such
incredible
pain
,
to
deceive
me
!
<EOS>
He
act
the
part
of
a
nurse
to
my
little
infant
;
he
dance
it
,
he
lull
it
,
he
kiss
it
;
declare
it
be
the
very
picture
of
a
nephew
of
his
  
h
<EOS>
be
favourite
sister
's
child
;
and
say
so
many
kind
and
fond
thing
of
its
beauty
,
that
I
myself
,
though
,
I
believe
,
one
of
the
tender
and
fond
of
mother
,
scarce
carry
my
own
idea
of
my
little
darling
's
perfection
beyond
the
compliment
which
he
pay
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
however
,
perhaps
from
modesty
,
before
my
face
,
fall
far
short
of
what
Mrs.
Ellison
report
from
him
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
when
she
find
the
impression
which
be
make
on
me
by
these
mean
,
she
take
every
opportunity
of
insinuate
to
me
his
lordship
's
many
virtue
,
his
great
goodness
to
his
sister
's
child
in
particular
;
nor
do
she
fail
to
drop
some
hint
which
give
me
the
most
simple
and
groundless
hope
of
strange
consequence
from
his
fondness
to
my
Charley
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
,
by
these
mean
,
which
,
simple
as
they
may
appear
,
be
,
perhaps
,
the
most
artful
,
my
lord
have
gain
something
more
,
I
think
,
than
my
esteem
,
he
take
the
sure
method
to
confirm
himself
in
my
affection
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
by
profess
the
high
friendship
for
my
husband
;
for
,
as
to
myself
,
I
do
assure
you
he
never
shew
me
more
than
common
respect
;
and
I
hope
you
will
believe
I
should
have
immediately
startle
and
fly
off
if
he
have
.
<EOS>
poor
I
account
for
all
the
friendship
which
he
express
for
my
husband
,
and
all
the
fondness
which
he
shew
to
my
boy
,
from
the
great
prettiness
of
the
one
and
the
great
merit
of
the
other
;
foolishly
conceive
that
other
see
with
my
eye
and
feel
with
my
heart
.
<EOS>
little
do
I
dream
that
my
own
unfortunate
person
be
the
fountain
of
all
this
lord
's
goodness
,
and
be
the
intend
price
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
evening
,
as
I
be
drink
tea
with
Mrs.
Ellison
by
my
lord
's
fire
(
a
liberty
which
she
never
scruple
taking
when
he
be
go
out
)
,
my
little
Charley
,
now
about
half
a
year
old
,
sit
in
her
lap
,
my
lord
 
accidentally
,
no
doubt
,
indeed
I
then
think
it
<EOS>
so
 
come
in
.
<EOS>
I
be
confound
,
and
offer
to
go
;
but
my
lord
declare
,
if
he
disturb
Mrs.
Ellison
's
company
,
as
he
phrase
it
,
he
would
himself
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
thus
prevail
on
to
keep
my
seat
,
my
lord
immediately
take
my
little
baby
into
his
lap
,
and
give
it
some
tea
there
,
not
a
little
at
the
expense
of
his
embroidery
;
for
he
be
very
richly
dr
;
indeed
,
he
be
as
fine
a
figure
as
perhaps
ever
be
see
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
on
this
occasion
give
me
many
idea
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
discover
good
sense
,
good
nature
,
condescension
,
and
other
good
quality
,
by
the
fondness
he
shew
to
my
child
,
and
the
contempt
he
seem
to
express
for
his
finery
,
which
so
greatly
become
him
;
for
I
can
not
deny
but
that
he
be
the
handsome
and
genteel
person
in
the
world
,
though
such
consideration
advance
him
not
a
step
in
my
favour
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
husband
now
return
from
church
(
for
this
happen
on
a
Sunday
)
,
and
be
,
by
my
lord
's
particular
desire
,
usher
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
My
lord
receive
him
with
the
utmost
politeness
,
and
with
many
profession
of
esteem
,
which
,
he
say
,
he
have
conceive
from
Mrs.
Ellison
's
representation
of
his
merit
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
mention
the
living
which
be
detain
from
my
husband
,
of
which
Mrs.
Ellison
have
likewise
inform
him
;
and
say
,
he
think
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
obtain
a
restoration
of
it
by
the
authority
of
the
bishop
,
who
be
his
particular
friend
,
and
to
whom
he
would
take
an
immediate
opportunity
of
mention
it
.
<EOS>
this
,
at
last
,
he
determine
to
do
the
very
next
day
,
when
he
invite
us
both
to
dinner
,
where
we
be
to
be
acquaint
with
his
lordship
's
success
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
now
insist
on
my
husband
's
stay
supper
with
him
,
without
take
any
notice
of
me
;
but
Mrs.
Ellison
declare
he
should
not
part
man
and
wife
,
and
that
she
herself
would
stay
with
me
.
<EOS>
the
motion
be
too
agreeable
to
me
to
be
reject
;
and
,
except
the
little
time
I
retire
to
put
my
child
to
bed
,
we
spend
together
the
most
agreeable
evening
imaginable
;
nor
be
it
,
I
believe
,
easy
to
decide
whether
Mr.
Bennet
or
myself
be
most
delighted
with
his
lordship
and
Mrs.
Ellison
;
but
this
,
I
assure
you
,
the
generosity
of
the
one
,
and
the
extreme
civility
and
kindness
of
the
other
,
be
the
subject
of
our
conversation
all
the
ensue
night
,
during
which
we
neither
of
us
close
our
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
next
day
at
dinner
my
lord
acquaint
us
that
he
have
prevail
with
the
bishop
to
write
to
the
clergyman
in
the
country
;
indeed
,
he
tell
us
that
he
have
engage
the
bishop
to
be
very
warm
in
our
interest
,
and
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
success
.
<EOS>
this
throw
us
both
into
a
flow
of
spirit
;
and
in
the
afternoon
Mr.
Bennet
,
at
Mrs.
Ellison
's
request
,
which
be
second
by
his
lordship
,
relate
the
history
of
our
life
from
our
first
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
My
lord
seem
much
affect
with
some
tender
scene
,
which
,
as
no
man
could
better
feel
,
so
none
could
better
describe
,
than
my
husband
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
,
my
lord
beg
pardon
for
mention
an
occurrence
which
give
him
such
a
particular
concern
,
as
it
have
disturb
that
delicious
state
of
happiness
in
which
we
have
live
at
our
former
lodging
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
ungenerous
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
rejoice
at
an
accident
which
,
though
it
bring
me
fortunately
acquaint
with
two
of
the
most
agreeable
people
in
the
world
,
be
yet
at
the
expense
of
your
mutual
felicity
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
,
I
mean
,
be
your
debt
at
Oxford
;
pray
,
how
doth
that
stand
?
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
it
shall
never
disturb
your
happiness
hereafter
.
<EOS>
"
at
these
word
the
tear
burst
from
my
poor
husband
's
eye
;
and
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
gratitude
,
he
cry
out
,
"
Your
lordship
overcome
me
with
generosity
.
<EOS>
if
you
go
on
in
this
manner
,
both
my
wife
's
gratitude
and
mine
must
be
bankrupt
<EOS>
"
He
then
acquaint
my
lord
with
the
exact
state
of
the
case
,
and
receive
assurance
from
him
that
the
debt
should
never
trouble
him
.
<EOS>
My
husband
be
again
break
out
into
the
warm
expression
of
gratitude
,
but
my
lord
stopt
him
short
,
say
,
"
if
you
have
any
obligation
,
it
be
to
my
little
Charley
here
,
from
whose
little
innocent
smile
I
have
receive
more
than
the
value
of
this
trifle
debt
in
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
,
when
I
offer
to
leave
the
room
after
dinner
upon
my
child
's
account
,
my
lord
would
not
suffer
me
,
but
order
the
child
to
be
bring
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
now
take
it
out
of
my
arm
,
place
it
upon
his
own
knee
,
and
feed
it
with
some
fruit
from
the
dessert
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
would
be
more
tedious
to
you
than
to
myself
to
relate
the
thousand
little
tenderness
he
shew
to
the
child
.
<EOS>
He
give
it
many
bauble
;
amongst
the
rest
be
a
coral
worth
at
least
three
pound
;
and
,
when
my
husband
be
confine
near
a
fortnight
to
his
chamber
with
a
cold
,
he
visit
the
child
every
day
(
for
to
this
infant
's
account
be
all
the
visit
place
)
,
and
seldom
fail
of
accompany
his
visit
with
a
present
to
the
little
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
Mrs.
Booth
,
I
can
not
help
mention
a
doubt
which
hath
often
arise
in
my
mind
since
I
have
be
enough
mistress
of
myself
to
reflect
on
this
horrid
train
which
be
lay
to
blow
up
my
innocence
.
<EOS>
wicked
and
barbarous
it
be
to
the
high
degree
without
any
question
;
but
my
doubt
be
,
whether
the
art
or
folly
of
it
be
the
more
conspicuous
;
for
,
however
delicate
and
refine
the
art
must
be
allow
to
have
be
,
the
folly
,
I
think
,
must
upon
a
fair
examination
appear
no
less
astonishing
:
for
to
lay
all
consideration
of
cruelty
and
crime
out
of
the
case
,
what
a
foolish
bargain
doth
the
man
make
for
himself
who
purchase
so
poor
a
pleasure
at
so
high
a
price
!
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
live
near
three
week
with
as
much
freedom
as
if
we
have
be
all
of
the
same
family
,
when
,
one
afternoon
,
my
lord
propose
to
my
husband
to
ride
down
himself
to
solicit
the
surrender
;
for
he
say
the
bishop
have
receive
an
unsatisfactory
answer
from
the
parson
,
and
have
writ
a
second
letter
more
pressing
,
which
his
lordship
now
promise
us
to
strengthen
by
one
of
his
own
that
my
husband
be
to
carry
with
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bennet
agree
to
this
proposal
with
great
thankfulness
,
and
the
next
day
be
appoint
for
his
journey
.
<EOS>
the
distance
be
near
seventy
mile
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
husband
set
out
on
his
journey
,
and
he
have
scarce
leave
me
before
Mrs.
Ellison
come
into
my
room
,
and
endeavour
to
comfort
me
in
his
absence
;
to
say
the
truth
,
though
he
be
to
be
from
me
but
a
few
day
,
and
the
purpose
of
his
going
be
to
fix
our
happiness
on
a
sound
foundation
for
all
our
future
day
,
I
could
scarce
support
my
spirit
under
this
first
separation
.
<EOS>
but
though
I
then
think
Mrs.
Ellison
's
intention
to
be
most
kind
and
friendly
,
yet
the
mean
she
use
be
utterly
ineffectual
,
and
appear
to
me
injudicious
.
<EOS>
instead
of
soothe
my
uneasiness
,
which
be
always
the
first
physic
to
be
give
to
grief
,
she
rally
me
upon
it
,
and
begin
to
talk
in
a
very
unusual
stile
of
gaiety
,
in
which
she
treat
conjugal
love
with
much
ridicule
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
give
her
to
understand
that
she
displease
me
by
this
discourse
;
but
she
soon
find
mean
to
give
such
a
turn
to
it
as
make
a
merit
of
all
she
have
say
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
when
she
have
work
me
into
a
good
humour
,
she
make
a
proposal
to
me
which
I
at
first
reject
 
but
at
last
fatally
,
too
fatally
,
suffer
myself
to
be
over
-
persuade
.
<EOS>
this
be
to
go
to
a
masquerade
at
Ranelagh

for
which
my

have
furnish
her
with
ticket

Amelia
turn
pale
as
death

and
hastily
beg
her
friend
to
give
her
a
glass
of
water

some
air

or
anything

<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet

have
throw
open
the
window

procure
the
water

prevent
Amelia
from
faint

recover
their

I
be
at

accompany
Mrs.

here
,
I
must
confess

the
pleasantness
of
the
place

the
variety
of
the
dress

the
novelty
of
the
thing

give

much
delight

raise
my

unguarded

every
temptation

during
the

I
wish
I
could
with
truth

I

at

that
I

will
disguise
nothing

discover

have
already
too
firm

make
the
discovery
shocking

derive
his

at

my
intention

with
the
delicacy
of
his
passion
;
and
,
in
the
foolish
thoughtless
turn
of
mind
in
which
I
then
be
,
I
fancy
I
may
give
some
very
distant
encouragement
to
such
a
passion
in
such
a
man
with
the
utmost
safety
 
that
I
may
indulge
my
vanity
and
interest
at
once
,
without
be
guilty
of
the
least
injury
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
Mrs.
Booth
will
condemn
all
these
thought
,
and
I
condemn
them
no
less
myself
;
for
it
be
now
my
stedfast
opinion
that
the
woman
who
give
up
the
least
outwork
of
her
virtue
doth
,
in
that
very
moment
,
betray
the
citadel
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
two
o'clock
we
return
home
,
and
find
a
very
handsome
collation
provide
for
us
.
<EOS>
I
be
ask
to
partake
of
it
,
and
I
do
not
,
I
could
not
refuse
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
,
however
,
entirely
void
of
all
suspicion
,
and
I
make
many
resolution
;
one
of
which
be
,
not
to
drink
a
drop
more
than
my
usual
stint
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
at
the
utmost
,
little
more
than
half
a
pint
of
small
punch
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
adhere
strictly
to
my
quantity
;
but
in
the
quality
I
be
convinced
I
be
deceive
;
for
before
I
leave
the
room
I
find
my
head
giddy
.
<EOS>
what
the
villain
give
me
I
know
not
;
but
,
besides
be
intoxicate
,
I
perceive
effect
from
it
which
be
not
to
be
describe
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
madam
,
I
must
draw
a
curtain
over
the
residue
of
that
fatal
night
.
<EOS>
let
it
suffice
that
it
involve
me
in
the
most
dreadful
ruin
;
a
ruin
to
which
I
can
truly
say
I
never
consent
,
and
of
which
I
be
scarce
conscious
when
the
villanous
man
avow
it
to
my
face
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
thus
I
have
deduce
my
story
to
the
most
horrid
period
;
happy
have
I
be
have
<EOS>
this
be
the
period
of
my
life
,
but
I
be
reserve
for
great
misery
;
but
before
I
enter
on
them
I
will
mention
something
very
remarkable
,
with
which
I
be
now
acquaint
,
and
that
will
shew
there
be
nothing
of
accident
which
have
befall
me
,
but
that
all
be
the
effect
of
a
long
,
regular
,
premeditated
design
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
remember
,
madam
,
I
tell
you
that
we
be
recommend
to
Mrs.
Ellison
by
the
woman
at
whose
house
we
have
before
lodge
.
<EOS>
this
woman
,
it
seem
,
be
one
of
my
lord
's
pimp
,
and
have
before
introduce
me
to
his
lordship
's
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
to
know
then
,
madam
,
that
this
villain
,
this
lord
,
now
confest
to
me
that
he
have
first
see
me
in
the
gallery
at
the
oratorio
,
whither
I
have
go
with
ticket
with
which
the
woman
where
I
first
lodge
have
present
me
,
and
which
be
,
it
seem
,
purchase
by
my
lord

<EOS>
here
I
first
meet
the
vile
betrayer
,
who
be
disguise
in
a
rug
coat
and
a
patch
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
Amelia
cry
,
"
o
,
gracious
heaven
!
"
and
fall
back
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
,
with
proper
application
,
bring
her
back
to
life
;
and
then
Amelia
acquaint
her
that
she
herself
have
first
see
the
same
person
in
the
same
place
,
and
in
the
same
disguise

"
<EOS>
o
,
Mrs.

she
,
"
how
be
I
indebted

you

<EOS>
what
word

what
thank

what
action
can
demonstrate
the
gratitude
of
my
sentiment

<EOS>
I
look
upon
you

always
shall
look
upon
you

as
my
preserver
from
the
brink

a
precipice

which
I
be
fall
into
the

ruin

you
have
so
generously

so
kindly
,
and
so
nobly
disclose
for
my
sake

"
  
<EOS>
here
the
two
lady
compare
note
;
and
it
appear
that
his
lordship
's
behaviour
at
the
oratorio
have
be
alike
to
both
;
that
he
have
make
use
of
the
very
same
word
,
the
very
same
action
to
Amelia
,
which
he
have
practise
over
before
on
poor
unfortunate
Mrs.
Bennet
.
<EOS>
It
may
,
perhaps
,
be
think
strange
that
neither
of
them
could
afterwards
recollect
him
;
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
if
we
consider
the
force
of
disguise
,
the
very
short
time
that
either
of
them
be
with
him
at
this
first
interview
,
and
the
very
little
curiosity
that
must
have
be
suppose
in
the
mind
of
the
lady
,
together
with
the
amusement
in
which
they
be
then
engage
,
all
wonder
will
,
I
apprehend
,
cease
.
<EOS>
Amelia
,
however
,
now
declare
she
remember
his
voice
and
feature
perfectly
well
,
and
be
thoroughly
satisfied
he
be
the
same
person
.
<EOS>
She
then
account
for
his
not
have
visit
in
the
afternoon
,
accord
to
his
promise
,
from
her
declared
resolution
to
Mrs.
Ellison
not
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
She
now
burst
forth
into
some
very
satirical
invective
against
that
lady
,
and
declare
she
have
the
art
,
as
well
as
the
wickedness
,
of
the
devil
himself
.
  
<EOS>
many
congratulation
now
past
from
Mrs.
Bennet
to
Amelia
,
which
be
return
with
the
most
hearty
acknowledgment
from
that
lady
.
<EOS>
but
,
instead
of
fill
our
paper
with
these
,
we
shall
pursue
Mrs.
Bennet
's
story
,
which
she
resume
as
we
shall
find
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
further
continuation
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
sooner
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bennet
,
continue
her
story
,
"
be
my
lord
depart
,
than
Mrs.
Ellison
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
behave
in
such
a
manner
,
when
she
become
acquaint
with
what
have
past
,
that
,
though
I
be
at
first
satisfied
of
her
guilt
,
she
begin
to
stagger
my
opinion
,
and
at
length
prevail
upon
me
entirely
to
acquit
her
.
<EOS>
She
rave
like
a
mad
woman
against
my
lord
,
swear
he
should
not
stay
a
moment
in
her
house
,
and
that
she
would
never
speak
to
him
more
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
have
she
be
the
most
innocent
woman
in
the
world
,
she
could
not
have
speak
nor
act
any
otherwise
,
nor
could
she
have
vent
more
wrath
and
indignation
against
the
betrayer
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
part
of
her
denunciation
of
vengeance
which
concern
my
lord
's
leave
the
house
she
vow
should
be
execute
immediately
;
but
then
,
seem
to
recollect
herself
,
she
say
,
"
consider
,
my
dear
child
,
it
be
for
your
sake
alone
<EOS>
I
speak
;
will
not
such
a
proceeding
give
some
suspicion
to
your
husband
?
<EOS>
"
I
answer
,
that
I
value
not
that
;
that
I
be
resolve
to
inform
my
husband
of
all
the
moment
I
see
him
;
with
many
expression
of
detestation
of
myself
and
an
indifference
for
life
and
for
everything
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Ellison
,
however
,
find
mean
to
soothe
me
,
and
to
satisfy
me
with
my
own
innocence
,
a
point
in
which
,
I
believe
,
we
be
all
easily
convince
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
be
persuade
to
acquit
both
myself
and
her
,
to
lay
the
whole
guilt
upon
my
lord
,
and
to
resolve
to
conceal
it
from
my
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
whole
day
I
confine
myself
to
my
chamber
and
see
no
person
but
Mrs.
Ellison
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
indeed
,
ashamed
to
look
any
one
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
happily
for
me
,
my
lord
go
into
the
country
without
attempt
to
come
near
me
,
for
I
believe
his
sight
would
have
drive
me
to
madness
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
next
day
I
tell
Mrs.
Ellison
that
I
be
resolve
to
leave
her
lodging
the
moment
my
lord
come
to
town
;
not
on
her
account
(
for
I
really
inclined
to
think
her
innocent
)
,
but
on
my
lord
's
,
whose
face
I
be
resolve
,
if
possible
,
never
more
to
behold
.
<EOS>
She
tell
me
I
have
no
reason
to
quit
her
house
on
that
score
,
for
that
my
lord
himself
have
leave
her
lodging
that
morning
in
resentment
,
she
believe
,
of
the
abuse
which
she
have
cast
on
him
the
day
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
confirm
me
in
the
opinion
of
her
innocence
;
nor
hath
she
from
that
day
to
this
,
till
my
acquaintance
with
you
,
madam
,
do
anything
to
forfeit
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
owe
her
many
good
office
;
amongst
the
rest
,
I
have
an
annuity
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
a
-
year
from
my
lord
,
which
I
know
be
owe
to
her
solicitation
,
for
she
be
not
void
of
generosity
or
good
-
nature
;
though
by
what
I
have
lately
see
,
I
be
convinced
she
be
the
cause
of
my
ruin
,
and
hath
endeavour
to
lay
the
same
snare
for
you

<EOS>
"
but
to
return
to
my
melancholy
story
.
<EOS>
My
husband
return
at
the
appoint
time
;
and
I
meet
him
with
an
agitation
of
mind
not
to
be
describe
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
fatigue
which
he
have
undergo
in
his
journey
,
and
his
dissatisfaction
at
his
ill
success
,
prevent
his
take
notice
of
what
I
fear
be
too
visible
.
<EOS>
all
his
hope
be
entirely
frustrated
;
the
clergyman
have
not
receive
the
bishop
's
letter
,
and
as
to
my
lord
's
he
treat
it
with
derision
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
tired
as
he
be
,
Mr.
Bennet
would
not
sit
down
till
he
have
enquire
for
my
lord
,
intend
to
go
and
pay
his
compliment
.
<EOS>
poor
man
!
<EOS>
he
little
suspect
that
he
have
deceive
him
,
as
I
have
since
know
,
concern
the
bishop
;
much
less
do
he
suspect
any
other
injury
.
<EOS>
but
the
lord
 
<EOS>
the
villain
be
go
out
of
town
,
so
that
he
be
force
to
postpone
all
his
gratitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bennet
return
to
town
late
on
the
Saturday
night
,
nevertheless
he
perform
his
duty
at
church
the
next
day
,
but
I
refuse
to
go
with
him
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
think
,
be
the
first
refusal
I
be
guilty
of
since
our
marriage
;
but
I
be
become
so
miserable
,
that
his
presence
,
which
have
be
the
source
of
all
my
happiness
,
be
become
my
bane
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
I
hate
to
see
him
,
but
I
can
say
I
be
ashamed
,
indeed
afraid
,
to
look
him
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
I
be
conscious
of
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
 
<EOS>
guilt
<EOS>
I
hope
it
can
not

call

Mrs.
Bennet

perceive
my
dissatisfaction

impute
it
to
his
ill

success

country

I
be
pleased
with
this
self

delusion

when
I
fairly
compute
the
agony
I
suffer
at
his
endeavour
to
comfort
me
on
that
head

I
pay
most
severely
for
it

my
dear
Mrs.
Booth

<EOS>
happy

the
deceive
party
between
true
lover

wretche
indeed
be
the
author
of
the
deceit

<EOS>
"
in
this
wretched
condition
I
pass
a
whole
week
,
the
most
miserable
I
think
of
my
whole
life

endeavour
to
humour
my
husband
's
delusion
and
to
conceal
my
own
torture
;
but
I
have
reason
to
fear
I
could
not
succeed
long
,
for
on
the
Saturday
night
I
perceive
a
visible
alteration
in
his
behaviour
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
go
to
bed
in
an
apparent
ill
-
humour
,
turn
sullenly
from
me
,
and
if
I
offer
at
any
endearment
he
give
me
only
peevish
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
a
restless
turbulent
night
,
he
rise
early
on
Sunday
morning
and
walk
down
-
stair
.
<EOS>
I
expect
his
return
to
breakfast
,
but
be
soon
inform
by
the
maid
that
he
be
go
forth
,
and
that
it
be
no
more
than
seven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
all
this
you
may
believe
,
madam
,
alarm
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
plainly
he
have
discover
the
fatal
secret
,
though
by
what
mean
I
could
not
divine
.
<EOS>
the
state
of
my
mind
be
very
little
short
of
madness
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
of
run
away
from
my
injured
husband
,
and
sometimes
of
put
an
end
to
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
midst
of
such
perturbation
I
spend
the
day
.
<EOS>
My
husband
return
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
o
,
Heavens
!
<EOS>
can
I
describe
what
follow
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
!
<EOS>
I
shall
sink
under
the
relation
.
<EOS>
He
enter
the
room
with
a
face
as
white
as
a
sheet
,
his
lip
tremble
and
his
eye
red
as
coal
of
fire
start
as
it
be
from
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
molly
,
"
cry
he
,
throw
himself
into
his
chair
,
"
be
you
well
?
"
<EOS>
"
Good
Heavens
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
"
what
be
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
can
not
say
I
be
well

"
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
say
he
,
start
from
his
chair

"
false
monster
,
you
have
betray
me
,
destroy
me
,
you
have
ruin
your
husband

<EOS>
then
look
like
a
fury
,
he
snatch
off
a
large
book
from
the
table
,
and
,
with
the
malice
of
a
madman
,
throw
it
at
my
head
and
knock
me
down
backwards
.
<EOS>
He
then
catch
me
up
in
his
arm
and
kiss
me
with
most
extravagant
tenderness
;
then
,
look
me
stedfastly
in
the
face
for
several
moment
,
the
tear
gush
in
a
torrent
from
his
eye
,
and
with
his
utmost
violence
he
throw
me
again
on
the
floor
,
kick
me
,
stamp
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
indeed
,
his
intent
be
to
kill
me
,
and
I
believe
he
think
he
have
accomplish
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
lie
on
the
ground
for
some
minute
,
I
believe
,
deprive
of
my
sense

<EOS>
when
I
recover
myself
I
find
my
husband
lie
by
my
side
on
his
face
,
and
the
blood
run
from
him
.
<EOS>
It
seem
,
when
he
think
he
have
despatch
me
,
he
run
his
head
with
all
his
force
against
a
chest
of
drawer
which
stand
in
the
room
,
and
give
himself
a
dreadful
wound
in
his
head

<EOS>
"
I
can
truly
say
I
feel
not
the
least
resentment
for
the
usage
I
have
receive
;
I
think
I
deserve
it
all
;
though
,
indeed
,
I
little
guess
what
he
have
suffer
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
now
use
the
most
earnest
entreaty
to
him
to
compose
himself
;
and
endeavour
,
with
my
feeble
arm
,
to
raise
him
from
the
ground
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
break
from
me
,
and
,
spring
from
the
ground
,
fling
himself
into
a
chair
,
<EOS>
when
,
look
wildly
at
me
,
he
cry
"
go
from
me
,
Molly
.
<EOS>
I
beseech
you
,
leave
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
kill
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
discover
to
me
 
o
Mrs.
Booth
!
<EOS>
can
you
not
guess
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
pollute
by
the
villain
 
<EOS>
I
have
infect
my
husband
.
 
<EOS>
o
heavens
!
<EOS>
why
do
I
live
to
relate
anything
<EOS>
so
horrid
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
,
I
can
not
yet
survive
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
forgive
myself
.
<EOS>
Heaven
can
not
forgive
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
here
she
become
inarticulate
with
the
violence
of
her
grief
,
and
fall
presently
into
such
agony
,
that
the
fright
Amelia
begin
to
call
aloud
for
some
assistance
.
<EOS>
upon
this
a
maid
-
servant
come
up
,
who
,
see
her
mistress
in
a
violent
convulsion
fit
,
presently
scream
out
she
be
dead
.
<EOS>
upon
which
one
of
the
other
sex
make
his
appearance
:
and
who
should
this
be
but
the
honest
serjeant
?
<EOS>
whose
countenance
soon
make
it
evident
that
,
though
a
soldier
,
and
a
brave
one
too
,
he
be
not
the
least
concerned
of
all
the
company
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
,
if
he
hath
be
acquaint
with
scene
of
this
kind
,
very
well
know
that
Mrs.
Bennet
,
in
the
usual
time
,
return
again
to
the
possession
of
her
voice
:
the
first
use
of
which
she
make
be
to
express
her
astonishment
at
the
presence
of
the
serjeant
,
and
,
with
a
frantic
air
,
to
enquire
who
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
maid
,
conclude
that
her
mistress
be
not
yet
return
to
her
sense
,
answer
,
"
why
,
'
tis
my
master
,
madam
.
<EOS>
Heaven
preserve
your
sense
,
madam
!
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
sir
,
my
mistress
must
be
very
bad
not
to
know
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
what
Atkinson
think
at
this
instant
,
I
will
not
say
;
but
certain
it
be
he
look
not
over
-
wise
.
<EOS>
He
attempt
twice
to
take
hold
of
Mrs.
Bennet
's
hand
,
but
she
withdraw
it
hastily
,
and
presently
after
,
rise
up
from
her
chair
,
she
declare
herself
pretty
well
again
,
and
desire
Atkinson
and
the
maid
to
withdraw
.
<EOS>
both
of
whom
presently
obey
:
the
serjeant
appear
by
his
countenance
to
want
comfort
almost
as
much
as
the
lady
do
to
whose
assistance
he
have
be
summon
,
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
maxim
to
trust
a
person
entirely
or
not
at
all
;
for
a
secret
be
often
innocently
blab
out
by
those
who
know
but
half
of
it
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
the
maid
's
speech
communicate
a
suspicion
to
the
mind
of
Amelia
which
the
behaviour
of
the
serjeant
do
not
tend
to
remove
:
<EOS>
what
that
is
,
the
sagacious
reader
may
likewise
probably
suggest
to
themselves
;
if
not
,
they
must
wait
our
time
for
disclose
it
.
<EOS>
We
shall
now
resume
the
history
of
Mrs.
Bennet
,
who
,
after
many
apology
,
proceed
to
the
matter
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
the
conclusion
of
Mrs.
Bennet
's
history
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
I
become
sensible
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Bennet
,
"
of
the
injury
I
have
do
my
husband
<EOS>
,
I
throw
myself
at
his
foot
,
and
embrace
his
knee
,
while
I
bathe
them
with
my
tear
,
I
beg
a
patient
hearing
,
declare
,
if
he
be
not
satisfied
with
what
I
should
say
,
I
would
become
a
willing
victim
of
his
resentment
,
I
say
,
and
<EOS>
I
say
truly
,
that
,
if
I
owe
my
death
that
instant
to
his
hand
,
I
should
have
no
other
terrour
but
of
the
fatal
consequence
which
it
may
produce
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
seem
a
little
pacified
,
and
bid
me
say
whatever
I
please
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
then
give
him
a
faithful
relation
of
all
that
have
happen
.
<EOS>
He
hear
me
with
great
attention
,
and
at
the
conclusion
cry
,
with
a
deep
sigh
"
<EOS>
o
Molly
!
<EOS>
I
believe
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
have
be
betray
as
you
tell
me
;
you
could
not
be
guilty
of
such
baseness
,
such
cruelty
,
such
ingratitude
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
it
be
impossible
to
describe
his
behaviour
 
<EOS>
he
exprest
such
kindness
,
such
tenderness
,
such
concern
for
the
manner
in
which
he
have
use
me
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
dwell
on
this
scene
 
<EOS>
I
shall
relapse
 
<EOS>
you
must
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
beg
her
to
omit
anything
which
so
affect
her
;
and
she
proceed
thus
:
"
My
husband
,
who
be
more
convinced
than
I
be
of
Mrs.
Ellison
's
guilt
,
declare
he
would
not
sleep
that
night
in
her
house
.
<EOS>
He
then
go
out
to
see
for
a
lodging
;
he
give
me
all
the
money
he
have
,
and
leave
me
to
pay
her
bill
,
and
put
up
the
cloath
,
tell
me
,
if
I
have
not
money
enough
,
I
may
leave
the
cloath
as
a
pledge
;
but
he
vow
he
could
not
answer
for
himself
if
he
see
the
face
of
Mrs.
Ellison
.
  
<EOS>
"
word
can
not
scarce
express
the
behaviour
of
that
artful
woman
,
it
be
so
kind
<EOS>
and
so
generous
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
she
do
not
blame
my
husband
's
resentment
,
nor
could
she
expect
any
other
,
but
that
he
and
all
the
world
should
censure
her
 
that
she
hate
her
house
almost
as
much
as
we
do
,
and
detest
her
cousin
,
if
possible
,
more
.
<EOS>
in
fine
,
she
say
I
may
leave
my
cloath
there
that
evening
,
but
that
she
would
send
them
to
us
the
next
morning
;
that
she
scorn
the
thought
of
detain
them
;
and
as
for
the
paultry
debt
,
we
may
pay
her
whenever
we
please
;
for
,
to
do
her
justice
,
with
all
her
vice
,
she
hath
some
good
in
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
some
good
in
her
,
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Amelia
,
with
great
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
scarce
settle
in
our
new
lodging
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Bennet
,
"
when
my
husband
begin
to
complain
of
a
pain
in
his
inside
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
fear
he
have
do
himself
some
injury
in
his
rage
,
and
burst
something
within
him
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
odious
 
I
can
not
bear
the
thought
,
the
great
skill
of
his
surgeon
soon
entirely
cure
him
;
but
his
other
complaint
,
instead
of
yield
to
any
application
,
grow
still
bad
and
bad
,
nor
ever
end
till
it
bring
him
to
his
grave
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
Mrs.
Booth
!
<EOS>
could
I
have
be
certain
that
I
have
occasion
this
,
however
innocently
I
have
occasion
it
,
I
could
never
have
survive
it
;
but
the
surgeon
who
open
him
after
his
death
assure
me
that
he
die
of
what
they
call
a
polypus
in
his
heart
,
and
that
nothing
which
have
happen
on
account
of
me
be
in
the
least
the
occasion
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
however
,
relate
the
affair
truly
to
you
.
<EOS>
the
first
complaint
I
ever
hear
of
the
kind
be
within
a
day
or
two
after
we
leave
Mrs.
Ellison
's
;
and
this
complaint
remain
till
his
death
,
which
may
induce
him
perhaps
to
attribute
his
death
to
another
cause
;
but
the
surgeon
,
who
be
a
man
of
the
high
eminence
,
hath
always
declare
the
contrary
to
me
,
with
the
most
positive
certainty
;
and
this
opinion
hath
be
my
only
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
my
husband
die
,
which
be
about
ten
week
after
we
quit
Mrs.
Ellison
's
,
of
whom
I
have
then
a
different
opinion
from
what
I
have
now
,
I
be
leave
in
the
most
wretched
condition
imaginable
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
madam
,
she
shew
you
my
letter
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
do
everything
for
me
at
that
time
which
I
could
have
expect
from
the
good
of
friend
,
She
supply
me
with
money
from
her
own
pocket
,
by
which
mean
I
be
preserve
from
a
distress
in
which
I
must
have
otherwise
inevitably
perish
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
kindness
to
me
in
this
season
of
distress
prevail
on
me
to
return
again
to
her
house
.
<EOS>
why
,
indeed
,
should
I
have
refuse
an
offer
so
very
convenient
for
me
to
accept
,
and
which
seem
so
generous
in
her
to
make
?
<EOS>
here
I
live
a
very
retire
life
with
my
little
babe
,
see
no
company
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Ellison
herself
for
a
full
quarter
of
a
year
.
<EOS>
at
last
Mrs.
Ellison
bring
me
a
parchment
from
my
lord
,
in
which
he
have
settle
upon
me
,
at
her
instance
,
as
she
tell
me
,
and
as
I
believe
it
be
,
an
annuity
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
a
-
year
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
I
think
,
the
very
first
time
she
have
mention
his
hateful
name
to
me
since
my
return
to
her
house
.
<EOS>
and
she
now
prevail
upon
me
,
though
I
assure
you
not
without
some
difficulty
,
to
suffer
him
to
execute
the
deed
in
my
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
describe
our
interview
 
I
be
not
able
to
describe
it
,
and
I
have
often
wonder
how
I
find
spirit
to
support
it
.
<EOS>
this
I
will
say
for
him
,
that
,
if
he
be
not
a
real
penitent
,
no
man
alive
could
act
the
part
better
.
  
<EOS>
"
beside
resentment
,
I
have
another
motive
of
my
backwardness
to
agree
to
such
a
meeting
;
and
this
be
 
fear
.
<EOS>
I
apprehend
,
and
surely
not
without
reason
,
that
the
annuity
be
rather
mean
as
a
bribe
than
a
recompence
,
and
that
further
design
be
lay
against
my
innocence
;
but
in
this
I
find
myself
happily
deceive
;
for
neither
then
,
nor
at
any
time
since
,
have
I
ever
have
the
least
solicitation
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
nor
,
indeed
,
have
I
see
the
least
occasion
to
think
my
lord
have
any
such
desire
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
be
these
man
?
<EOS>
what
be
this
appetite
which
must
have
novelty
and
resistance
for
its
provocative

which
be
delighted
with
us

from

passion

she
begin
to
pour
forth
a
vast
profusion
of
acknowledgment
for
the
trouble
she
have
take
in
relate
her
history

chiefly
for
the
motive
which
have
induce
her

for
the
kind
warning

she
have
give
her

little
note

morning

lately

Amelia
would
then
have
take
her
leave
,
but
Mrs.
Bennet
so
strongly
press
her
to
stay
to
breakfast
,
that
at
length
she
comply
;
indeed
,
she
have
fast
so
long
,
and
her
gentle
spirit
have
be
so
agitated
with
variety
of
passion
,
that
nature
very
strongly
second
Mrs.
Bennet
's
motion
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
the
maid
be
prepare
the
tea
-
equipage
,
Amelia
,
with
a
little
slyness
in
her
countenance
,
ask
Mrs.
Bennet
if
serjeant
Atkinson
do
not
lodge
in
the
same
house
with
her
?
<EOS>
the
other
redden
so
extremely
at
the
question
,
repeat
the
serjeant
's
name
with
such
hesitation
,
and
behave
so
aukwardly
,
that
Amelia
want
no
further
confirmation
of
her
suspicion
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
,
however
,
declare
them
abruptly
to
the
other
,
but
begin
a
dissertation
on
the
serjeant
's
virtue
;
and
,
after
observe
the
great
concern
which
he
have
manifest
when
Mrs.
Bennet
be
in
her
fit
,
conclude
with
say
she
believe
the
serjeant
would
make
the
good
husband
in
the
world
,
for
that
he
have
great
tenderness
of
heart
and
a
gentleness
of
manner
not
often
to
be
find
in
any
man
,
and
much
seldomer
in
person
of
his
rank
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
not
in
his
rank
?
"
say
Mrs.
Bennet
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mrs.
Booth
,
we
rob
the
low
order
of
mankind
of
their
due
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
deny
the
force
and
power
of
education
;
but
,
when
we
consider
how
very
injudicious
be
the
education
of
the
well
sort
in
general
,
how
little
they
be
instruct
in
the
practice
of
virtue
,
we
shall
not
expect
to
find
the
heart
much
improve
by
it
.
<EOS>
and
even
as
to
the
head
,
how
very
slightly
do
we
commonly
find
it
improve
by
what
be
call
a
genteel
education
!
<EOS>
I
have
myself
,
I
think
,
see
instance
of
as
great
goodness
,
and
as
great
understanding
too
,
among
the
low
sort
of
people
as
among
the
high
.
<EOS>
let
us
compare
your
serjeant
,
now
,
with
the
lord
who
hath
be
the
subject
of
conversation
;
on
which
side
would
an
impartial
judge
decide
the
balance
to
incline
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
monstrous
then
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
be
the
opinion
of
those
who
consider
our
match
ourselves
the
least
below
us
in
degree
as
a
kind
of
contamination
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
most
absurd
and
preposterous
sentiment
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Bennet
warmly
;
"
how
abhorrent
from
justice
,
from
common
sense
,
and
from
humanity
 
but
how
extremely
incongruous
with
a
religion
which
profess
to
know
no
difference
of
degree
,
but
rank
all
mankind
on
the
footing
of
brother

<EOS>
of
all

there
be
none
so
unchristian
as

there

none

contemptible

<EOS>
contempt
,
indeed

may
be
say
to
be
its

object

for
my

I
know
none
so
despicable

despise

<EOS>

I
do
assure
you

Amelia

you
speak
my

I
give
you
my
word

I

rather
you

My

this
;
that

in

I

you

much
surprize

I

it
be
a
truth
you
could
hardly
expect
to
hear
from
me

with
so
much
good
-
humour
;
since
I
will
honestly
confess
to
you

what
need
have
I
to
confess
what
I
know
you

already

tell
me
now
sincerely

do
not
you

indeed

indeed

my

the

I
be
most
happy
in
your
approbation

<EOS>
in
honest
truth

you
ought
to
approve
my
choice
;
since
you
be
every
way
the
occasion
of
my
make
it
.
<EOS>
what
you
say
of
him
very
greatly
recommend
him
to
my
opinion

he
endear
himself
to
me
most
by
what
he
say
of
you

<EOS>
in
short
,
I
have
discover
that
he
hath
always
love
you
with
such
a
faithful
,
honest
,
noble
,
generous
passion
,
that
I
be
consequently
convince
his

must
possess
all
the
ingredient
of
such
a
passion

what
be
these

true
honour
,
goodness
,
modesty
,
bravery
,
tenderness
,
and
,
in
a
word

every
human
virtue

<EOS>
forgive
me
,
my
dear
;
but
I
be
uneasy
till
I
become
myself
the
object
of
such
a
passion

do
you
really
think

Amelia

smile
,
"
that
I
shall
forgive
you
rob
me
of
such
a
lover

<EOS>

,
suppose
what
you
banter
me
with
be
true
,
do
you
really
imagine
you
could
change
such
a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

my

answer
the

<EOS>
"
I
only
hope
I
have
change
the
object
;
for
be
assure
,
there
be
no
great
vulgar
error
than
that
it
be
impossible
for
a
man
who
love
one
woman
ever
to
love
another

<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
it
be
certain
that
a
man
who
can
love
one
woman
so
well
at
a
distance
will
love
another
well
that
be
near
to
him

I
have
hear
one
of
the
good
husband
in
the

declare
,
in
the
presence
of
his

,
that
he
have
always
love
a
princess
with
adoration
.
<EOS>
these
passion
,
which
reside
only
in
very
amorous

very
delicate
mind

feed
only
on
the
delicacy
there
grow

leave
all

enough
of

delicacy

for

the
other
,
"
that
be
not
a
place
of
security
;
and
you
know
,
captain
,
your
honour
be
a
shy
cock
;
I
have
be
after
your
honour
these
three
month
.
<EOS>
come
,
sir
,
you
must
go
to
my
house
,
if
you
please
.
"
<EOS>
"
with
all
my
heart
,
"
answer
Booth
,
"
if
it
be
anywhere
hereabouts
.
"
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
but
a
little
way
off
,
"
reply
the
bailiff
;
"
it
be
only
in
Gray's
-
inn
-
lane
,
just
by
almost
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
call
a
coach
,
and
desire
his
prisoner
to
walk
in
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
enter
the
coach
without
any
resistance
,
which
,
have
he
be
inclined
to
make
,
he
must
have
plainly
perceive
would
have
be
ineffectual
,
as
the
bailiff
appear
to
have
several
follower
at
hand
,
two
of
whom
,
beside
the
commander
in
chief
,
mount
with
him
into
the
coach
.
<EOS>
as
Booth
be
a
sweet
-
tempered
man
,
as
well
as
somewhat
of
a
philosopher
,
he
behave
with
all
the
good
-
humour
imaginable
,
and
indeed
,
with
more
than
his
companion
;
who
,
however
,
shew
him
what
they
call
civility
,
that
is
,
they
neither
strike
him
nor
spit
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
pleasantry
which
Booth
endeavour
to
preserve
,
he
in
reality
envy
every
labourer
whom
he
see
pass
by
him
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
the
charm
of
liberty
,
against
his
will
,
rush
on
his
mind
;
and
he
could
not
avoid
suggest
to
himself
<EOS>
how
much
more
happy
be
the
poor
wretch
who
,
without
controul
,
could
repair
to
his
homely
habitation
and
to
his
family
,
compare
to
him
,
who
be
thus
violently
,
and
yet
lawfully
,
tear
away
from
the
company
of
his
wife
and
child
.
<EOS>
and
their
condition
,
especially
that
of
his
Amelia
,
give
his
heart
many
a
severe
and
bitter
pang
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
he
arrive
at
the
bailiff
's
mansion
,
and
be
usher
into
a
room
in
which
be
several
person
.
<EOS>
Booth
desire
to
be
alone
;
upon
which
the
bailiff
wait
on
him
up
-
stair
into
an
apartment
,
the
window
of
which
be
well
fortify
with
iron
bar
,
but
the
wall
have
not
the
least
outwork
raise
before
them
;
they
be
,
indeed
,
what
be
generally
call
naked
;
the
brick
have
be
only
cover
with
a
thin
plaster
,
which
in
many
place
be
moulder
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
demand
make
upon
Booth
be
for
coach
-
hire
,
which
amount
to
two
shilling
,
accord
to
the
bailiff
's
account
;
that
be
just
double
the
legal
fare
.
<EOS>
He
be
then
ask
if
he
do
not
chuse
a
bowl
of
punch
?
<EOS>
to
which
he
have
answer
in
the
negative
,
the
bailiff
reply
,
"
Nay
,
sir
,
just
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
you
to
drink
,
if
you
do
not
chuse
it
;
but
certainly
you
know
the
custom
;
the
house
be
full
of
prisoner
,
and
I
can
not
afford
gentleman
a
room
to
themselves
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
presently
take
this
hint
 
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
a
pretty
broad
one
 
and
tell
the
bailiff
he
should
not
scruple
to
pay
him
his
price
;
but
in
fact
he
never
drink
unless
at
his
meal
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
to
that
,
sir
,
"
cry
the
bailiff
,
"
it
be
just
as
your
honour
please
.
<EOS>
I
scorn
to
impose
upon
any
gentleman
in
misfortune
:
I
wish
you
well
out
of
them
,
for
my
part
.
<EOS>
Your
honour
can
take
nothing
amiss
of
me
;
I
only
do
my
duty
,
what
I
be
bind
to
do
;
and
,
as
you
say
you
do
not
care
to
drink
anything
,
what
will
you
be
pleased
to
have
for
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
then
comply
in
bespeak
a
dish
of
meat
,
and
tell
the
bailiff
he
would
drink
a
bottle
with
him
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
then
desire
the
favour
of
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
a
messenger
;
all
which
be
immediately
procure
him
,
the
bailiff
tell
him
he
may
send
wherever
he
please
,
and
repeat
his
concern
for
Booth
's
misfortune
,
and
a
hearty
desire
to
see
the
end
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
messenger
be
just
dispatch
with
the
letter
,
when
who
should
arrive
but
honest
Atkinson
?
<EOS>
a
soldier
of
the
guard
,
belong
to
the
same
company
with
the
serjeant
,
and
who
have
know
Booth
at
Gibraltar
,
have
see
the
arrest
,
and
hear
the
order
give
to
the
coachman
.
<EOS>
this
fellow
,
accidentally
meet
Atkinson
,
have
acquaint
him
with
the
whole
affair
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
appearance
of
Atkinson
,
joy
immediately
overspread
the
countenance
of
Booth
.
<EOS>
the
ceremonial
which
past
between
them
be
unnecessary
to
be
repeat
.
<EOS>
Atkinson
be
soon
dispatch
to
the
attorney
and
to
Mrs.
Ellison
,
as
the
reader
hath
before
hear
from
his
own
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
now
greatly
lament
that
he
have
writ
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
think
she
may
have
be
acquaint
with
the
affair
better
by
the
serjeant
.
<EOS>
Booth
beg
him
,
however
,
to
do
everything
in
his
power
to
comfort
her
;
to
assure
her
that
he
be
in
perfect
health
and
good
spirit
;
and
to
lessen
as
much
as
possible
the
concern
which
he
know
she
would
have
at
the
reading
his
letter
.
  
<EOS>
the
serjeant
,
however
,
as
the
reader
hath
see
,
bring
himself
the
first
account
of
the
arrest
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
other
messenger
do
not
arrive
till
a
full
hour
afterwards
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
owe
to
any
slowness
of
his
,
but
to
many
previous
errand
which
he
be
to
execute
before
the
delivery
of
the
letter
;
for
,
notwithstanding
the
earnest
desire
which
the
bailiff
have
declare
to
see
Booth
out
of
his
trouble
,
he
have
order
the
porter
,
who
be
his
follower
,
to
call
upon
two
or
three
other
bailiff
,
and
as
many
attorney
,
to
try
to
load
his
prisoner
with
as
many
action
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
here
the
reader
may
be
apt
to
conclude
that
the
bailiff
,
instead
of
be
a
friend
,
be
really
an
enemy
to
poor
Booth
;
but
,
in
fact
,
he
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
His
desire
be
no
more
than
to
accumulate
bail
-
bond
;
for
the
bailiff
be
reckon
an
honest
and
good
sort
of
man
in
his
way
,
and
have
no
more
malice
against
the
body
in
his
custody
than
a
butcher
hath
to
those
in
his
:
and
as
the
latter
,
when
he
take
his
knife
in
hand
,
hath
no
idea
but
of
the
joint
into
which
he
be
to
cut
the
carcase
;
so
<EOS>
the
former
,
when
he
handle
his
writ
,
hath
no
other
design
but
<EOS>
to
cut
out
the
body
into
as
many
bail
-
bond
as
possible
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
life
of
the
animal
,
or
the
liberty
of
the
man
,
they
be
thought
which
never
obtrude
themselves
on
either
.
    
<EOS>
contain
an
account
of
Mr.
Booth
's
fellow
-
sufferer
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
return
to
Amelia
we
must
detain
our
reader
a
little
longer
with
Mr.
Booth
,
in
the
custody
of
Mr.
Bondum
the
bailiff
,
who
now
inform
his
prisoner
that
he
be
welcome
to
the
liberty
of
the
house
with
the
other
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
ask
who
those
gentleman
be
.
"
<EOS>
one
of
them
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr.
Bondum
,
"
be
a
very
great
writer
or
author
,
as
they
call
him
;
he
hath
be
here
these
five
week
at
the
suit
of
a
bookseller
for
eleven
pound
odd
money
;
but
he
expect
to
be
discharge
in
a
day
or
two
,
for
he
hath
writ
out
the
debt
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
write
for
five
or
six
bookseller
,
and
he
will
get
you
sometimes
,
when
he
sit
to
it
,
a
matter
of
fifteen
shilling
a
-
day
.
<EOS>
for
he
be
a
very
good
pen
,
they
say
,
but
be
apt
to
be
idle
.
<EOS>
some
day
he
will
not
write
above
five
hour
;
but
at
other
time
I
have
know
him
at
it
above
sixteen
.
"
<EOS>
"
ay
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Booth
;
"
pray
,
what
be
his
production
?
<EOS>
what
do
he
write
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
sometimes
,
"
answer
Bondum
,
"
he
write
your
history
book
for
your
number
,
and
sometimes
your
verse
,
your
poem
,
what
do
you
call
them
?
<EOS>
and
then
again
he
write
news
for
your
newspaper
.
"
<EOS>
"
ay
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
he
be
a
most
extraordinary
man
,
truly
!
 
<EOS>
how
doth
he
get
his
news
here
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
he
make
it
,
as
he
doth
your
parliament
speech
for
your
magazine
.
<EOS>
He
read
them
to
us
sometimes
over
a
bowl
of
punch
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
it
be
all
one
as
if
one
be
in
the
parliament
-
house
 
<EOS>
it
be
about
liberty
and
freedom
,
and
about
the
constitution
of
England
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
for
my
part
,
for
I
will
keep
my
neck
out
of
a
halter
;
but
,
faith
<EOS>
,
he
make
it
out
plainly
to
me
that
all
matter
be
not
as
they
should
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
all
for
liberty
,
for
my
part
.
"
<EOS>
"
be
that
so
consistent
with
your
calling
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
my
friend
,
you
have
live
by
deprive
man
of
their
liberty
.
"
<EOS>
"
that
be
another
matter
,
"
cry
the
bailiff
;
"
that
be
all
accord
to
law
,
and
in
the
way
of
business
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
man
must
be
oblige
to
pay
their
debt
,
or
else
there
would
be
an
end
of
everything
.
"
<EOS>
Booth
desire
the
bailiff
to
give
him
his
opinion
on
liberty
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
he
hesitate
a
moment
,
and
then
cry
out
,
"
o
'
tis
a
fine
thing
,
'
tis
a
very
fine
thing
,
and
the
constitution
of
England
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Booth
tell
him
,
that
by
the
old
constitution
of
England
he
have
hear
that
man
could
not
be
arrest
for
debt
;
to
which
the
bailiff
answer
,
that
must
have
be
in
very
bad
time
;
"
because
as
why
,
"
say
he
,
"
would
it
not
be
the
hard
thing
in
the
world
if
a
man
could
not
arrest
another
for
a
just
and
lawful
debt
?
<EOS>
besides
,
sir
,
you
must
be
mistake
;
for
how
could
that
ever
be
?
<EOS>
be
not
liberty
the
constitution
of
England
?
<EOS>
well
,
and
be
not
the
constitution
,
as
a
man
may
say
 
whereby
the
constitution
,
that
be
the
law
and
liberty
,
and
all
that
"
  
Booth
have
a
little
mercy
upon
the
poor
bailiff
,
when
he
find
him
round
in
this
manner
,
and
tell
him
he
have
make
the
matter
very
clear
.
<EOS>
Booth
then
proceed
to
enquire
after
the
other
gentleman
,
his
fellow
in
affliction
;
upon
which
Bondum
acquaint
him
that
one
of
the
prisoner
be
a
poor
fellow
.
"
<EOS>
He
call
himself
a
gentleman
,
"
say
Bondum
;
"
but
I
be
sure
I
never
see
anything
genteel
by
him
.
<EOS>
in
a
week
that
he
hath
be
in
my
house
<EOS>
he
hath
drink
only
part
of
one
bottle
of
wine
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
carry
him
to
Newgate
within
a
day
or
two
,
if
he
can
not
find
bail
,
which
,
I
suppose
,
he
will
not
be
able
to
do
;
for
everybody
say
he
be
an
undone
man
.
<EOS>
He
hath
run
out
all
he
hath
by
loss
in
business
,
and
one
way
or
other
;
and
he
hath
a
wife
and
seven
child
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
whole
family
here
the
other
day
,
all
howl
together
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
beggarly
crew
;
I
be
almost
ashamed
to
see
them
in
my
house
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
seem
fitter
for
Bridewell
than
any
other
place
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
I
do
not
reckon
him
as
proper
company
for
such
as
you
,
sir
;
but
there
be
another
prisoner
in
the
house
that
I
dare
say
you
will
like
very
much
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
very
much
of
a
gentleman
,
and
spend
his
money
like
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
him
only
three
day
,
and
I
be
afraid
he
will
not
stay
much
long
.
<EOS>
They
say
,
indeed
,
he
be
a
gamester
;
but
what
be
that
to
me
or
any
one
,
as
long
as
a
man
appear
as
a
gentleman
?
<EOS>
I
always
love
to
speak
by
people
as
I
find
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
he
be
fit
company
for
the
great
lord
in
the
land
;
for
he
hath
very
good
cloath
,
and
money
enough
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
here
for
debt
,
but
upon
a
judge
's
warrant
for
an
assault
and
battery
;
for
the
tipstaff
lock
up
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
bailiff
be
thus
harangue
when
he
be
interrupt
by
the
arrival
of
the
attorney
whom
the
trusty
serjeant
have
,
with
the
utmost
expedition
,
find
out
and
dispatch
to
the
relief
of
his
distressed
friend
.
<EOS>
but
before
we
proceed
any
further
with
the
captain
we
will
return
to
poor
Amelia
,
for
whom
,
consider
the
situation
in
which
we
leave
her
,
the
good
-
natured
reader
may
be
,
perhaps
,
in
no
small
degree
solicitous
.

some
extraordinary
behaviour
in
Mrs.
Ellison

<EOS>
the
serjeant

depart
to
convey
Mrs.
Ellison
to
the
captain
,
his
wife
go
to
fetch
Amelia
's
child
to
their

<EOS>
Amelia
's
concern
for
the

of
her
husband
be
aggravate
at
the
sight
of
her
child
.
"
<EOS>
Good
Heavens
!

"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
"
what
will
 
what
can
become
of
these
poor
little

<EOS>
why

I

these

<EOS>
at
which
word
she
embrace
them
eagerly
in
her
arm
,
and
bedew
them
both
with
her
tear

<EOS>
the
child
's
eye
soon
overflow
as
fast
as
their
mother

,
though
neither
of
them
know
the
cause

her
affliction

satisfy

of
health

at

<EOS>
Amelia
tell
him
she
have
not

.
<EOS>
upon
which
the
innocent
cry
out
,
"
La

<EOS>
how

such
fibs

<EOS>
a

tell

to

<EOS>
"
o

the

<EOS>
cry
Mrs.

<EOS>
Amelia
beg
Mrs.
Atkinson
to
say
something
to
her
child
,
for
that
her
spirit
be
overpower
.
<EOS>
She
then
throw
herself
into
a
chair
,
and
give
a
full
vent
to
a
passion
almost
too
strong
for
her
delicate
constitution
.
  
<EOS>
the
scene
that
follow
,
during
some
minute
,
be
beyond
my
power
of
description
;
I
must
beg
the
reader
'
heart
to
suggest
it
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
child
hang
on
their
mother
,
whom
they
endeavour
in
vain
to
comfort
,
as
Mrs.
Atkinson
do
in
vain
attempt
to
pacify
them
,
tell
them
all
would
be
well
,
and
they
would
soon
see
their
papa
again
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
partly
by
the
persuasion
of
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
partly
from
consideration
of
her
little
one
,
and
more
,
perhaps
,
from
the
relief
which
she
have
acquire
by
her
tear
,
Amelia
become
a
little
compose
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
worth
notice
past
in
this
miserable
company
from
this
time
till
the
return
of
Mrs.
Ellison
from
the
bailiff
's
house
;
and
to
draw
out
scene
of
wretchedness
to
too
great
a
length
,
be
a
task
very
uneasy
to
the
writer
,
and
for
which
none
but
reader
of
a
most
gloomy
complexion
will
think
themselves
ever
oblige
to
his
labour
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
Mrs.
Ellison
arrive
,
and
enter
the
room
with
an
air
of
gaiety
rather
misbecome
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
seat
herself
in
a
chair
she
tell
Amelia
that
the
captain
be
very
well
and
in
good
spirit
,
and
that
he
earnestly
desire
her
to
keep
up
her
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
do
not
be
disconsolate
<EOS>
;
I
hope
we
shall
soon
be
able
to
get
him
out
of
his
trouble
.
<EOS>
the
debt
,
indeed
,
amount
to
more
than
I
expect
;
however
,
way
may
be
find
to
redeem
him
.
<EOS>
He
must
own
himself
guilty
of
some
rashness
in
go
out
of
the
verge
,
when
he
know
to
what
he
be
liable
;
but
that
be
now
not
to
be
remedie

<EOS>
if
he
have
follow
my
advice
this
have
not
happen
;

man
will
be
headstrong

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not

this

Amelia

shall
I
hear
that
good
of
creature
blame
for
his
tenderness
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
will
not
blame
him
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Ellison
;
"
I
be
sure
I
propose
nothing
but
to
serve
him
;
and
if
you
will
do
as
much
to
serve
him
yourself
,
he
will
not
be
long
a
prisoner

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I

be
there
a
thing
upon

<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
there
be
a
thing
upon
earth
,
"
say
Mrs.
Ellison
,
"
and
a
very
easy
thing
too
;
<EOS>
and
yet
I
will
venture
my
life
you
start
when
I
propose
it
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
when
I
consider
that
you
be
a
woman
of
understanding
,
I
know
not
why
I
should
think
so
;
for
sure
you
must
have
too
much
good
sense
to
imagine
that
you
can
cry
your
husband
out
of
prison
.
<EOS>
if
this
would
have
do
,
I
see
you
have
almost
cry
your
eye
out
already
.
<EOS>
and
yet
you
may
do
the
business
by
a
much
pleasanter
way
than
by
cry
and
bawling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
,
madam
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Amelia

<EOS>
"
for
my
part

I
can
not
guess
your
meaning

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
before
I
tell
you
then
,
madam
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Ellison
,
"
I
must
inform
you
,
if
you
do
not
already
know
it
,
that
the
captain
be
charge
with
action
to
the
amount
of
near
five
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
would
willingly
be
his
bail
;
but
I
know
my
bail
would
not
be
take
for
that
sum
.
<EOS>
You
must
consider
,
therefore
,
madam
,
<EOS>
what
chance
you
have
of
redeem
him
;
unless
you
chuse
,
as
perhaps
some
wife
would

that
he
should
lie
all
his

in
prison

<EOS>
at
these
word
Amelia
discharge
a
shower
of
tear

give
every
mark
of
the
most
frantic
grief

<EOS>
"
why

there
now

"
cry
Mrs.
Ellison
,
"
while
you
will
indulge
these
extravagant
passion

how
can
you
be
capable

voice

<EOS>
I
know
I
be
a
fool
in
concern
myself
thus
with
the

I

the
thankless

I

Mrs.

speak
the

whisper

so
that
Mrs.

aloud

sure
nothing

the

<EOS>
"
such
impudence
,

answer
Mrs.

must
exceed

I

all
belief

,
when
woman
once
abandon

modesty

they
seldom

Mrs.

and
I
add
the
favour
of

masquerade
ticket

<EOS>
Could
I

that
you

before
my

ask
another

<EOS>

I
ask
your
pardon

I
impute
rather
more
assurance

<EOS>
You

endeavour

keep

and
it
be
by
mere
accident
only
that
I
discover
it

unless
there
be
some
guardian
angel

in
general
protect
innocence

,
I
may
say

I

so
watchful

<EOS>

indeed

Mrs.

you
be
not

I
stay
a

a

<EOS>
so
,
Mrs.
Booth
,
you
have
your

Mrs.

then
,
cast
a
look
of
great
indignation
at
both
the
lady

make
a
short
speech
full
of
invective
against
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
and
not
without
oblique
hint
of
ingratitude
against
poor
Amelia
;
after
which
she
burst
out
of
the
room
,
and
out
of
the
house
,
and
make
haste
to
her
own
home
,
in
a
condition
of
mind
to
which
fortune
without
guilt
can
not
,
I
believe
,
reduce
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
how
much
the
superiority
of
misery
be
on
the
side
of
wickedness
may
appear
to
every
reader
who
will
compare
the
present
situation
of
Amelia
with
that
of
Mrs.
Ellison
.
<EOS>
Fortune
have
attack
the
former
with
almost
the
high
degree
of
her
malice

She
be
involve
in
a
scene
of
most
exquisite
distress

yet
her
sorrow

however
exquisite

be
all
soft

tender

nor
be
she
without
many
consolation

<EOS>
Her
case
,
however
hard

be
not
absolutely
desperate
;
for
scarce
any
condition
of
fortune
can
be
so
.
<EOS>
art
and
industry
,
chance
and
friend
,
have
often
relieve
the
most
distrest
circumstance
,
and
convert
them
into
opulence
.
<EOS>
in
all
these
she
have
hope
on
this
side
the
grave
,
and
perfect
virtue
and
innocence
give
her
the
strong
assurance
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
whereas
,
in
the
bosom
of
Mrs.
Ellison
,
all
be
storm
and
temp
;
anger
,
revenge
,
fear
,
and
pride
,
like
so
many
rage
fury
,
possess
her
mind
,
and
torture
her
with
disappointment
and
shame
.
<EOS>
loss
of
reputation
,
which
be
generally
irreparable
,
be
to
be
her
lot
;
loss
of
friend
be
of
this
the
certain
consequence
;
all
on
this
side
the
grave
appear
dreary
and
comfortless
;
and
endless
misery
on
the
other

close
the
gloomy
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
hence
,
my
worthy
reader
,
console
thyself
,
that
however
few
of
the
other
good
thing
of
life
be
thy
lot
,
the
good
of
all
thing
,
which
be
innocence

be
always
within
thy
own
power

and
,
though
Fortune
may
make
thee
often
unhappy
,
she
can
never
make
thee
completely
and
irreparably
miserable
without
thy
own
consent

Containing

among

exemplary
behaviour

this
light
I
be
shock
at
my
own
folly
,
and
be
resolve
to
leave
my
child
under
your
care
,
and
go
directly
to
my
husband
.
<EOS>
I
may
comfort
him
.
<EOS>
I
may
assist
him
.
<EOS>
I
may
relieve
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
now
too
difficult
for
me
to
undertake
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Atkinson
greatly
approve
and
compliment
her
friend
on
all
the
former
part
of
her
speech
,
except
what
relate
to
herself
,
on
which
she
speak
very
civilly
,
and
I
believe
with
great
truth
;
but
as
to
her
determination
of
go
to
her
husband
she
endeavour
to
dissuade
her
,
at
least
she
beg
her
to
defer
it
for
the
present
,
and
till
the
serjeant
return
home
.
<EOS>
She
then
remind
Amelia
that
it
be
now
past
five
in
the
afternoon
,
and
that
she
have
not
take
any
refreshment
but
a
dish
of
tea
the
whole
day
,
and
desire
she
would
give
her
leave
to
procure
her
a
chick
,
or
anything
she
like
better
,
for
her
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
thank
her
friend
,
and
say
she
would
sit
down
with
her
to
whatever
she
please
;
"
but
if
I
do
not
eat
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
would
not
have
you
impute
it
to
anything
but
want
of
appetite
;
for
I
assure
you
all
thing
be
equally
indifferent
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
more
solicitous
about
these
poor
little
thing
,
who
have
not
be
use
to
fast
so
long
.
<EOS>
Heaven
know
what
may
hereafter
be
their
fate
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Atkinson
bid
her
hope
the
good
,
and
then
recommend
the
child
to
the
care
of
her
maid
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
arrive
a
servant
from
Mrs.
James
,
with
an
invitation
to
Captain
Booth
and
to
his
lady
to
dine
with
the
colonel
the
day
after
the
next
.
<EOS>
this
a
little
perplex
Amelia
;
but
after
a
short
consideration
she
despatch
an
answer
to
Mrs.
James
,
in
which
she
concisely
inform
her
of
what
have
happen
.
  
<EOS>
the
honest
serjeant
,
who
have
be
on
his
leg
almost
the
whole
day
,
now
return
,
and
bring
Amelia
a
short
letter
from
her
husband
,
in
which
he
give
her
the
most
solemn
assurance
of
his
health
and
spirit
,
and
beg
her
with
great
earnestness
to
take
care
to
preserve
her
own
,
which
if
she
do
,
he
say
,
he
have
no
doubt
but
that
they
should
shortly
be
happy
.
<EOS>
He
add
something
of
hope
from
my
lord
,
with
which
Mrs.
Ellison
have
amuse
him
,
and
which
serve
only
to
destroy
the
comfort
that
Amelia
receive
from
the
rest
of
his
letter
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
Amelia
,
the
serjeant
,
and
his
lady
,
be
engage
in
a
cold
collation
,
for
which
purpose
a
cold
chicken
be
procure
from
the
tavern
for
the
lady
,
and
two
pound
of
cold
beef
for
the
serjeant
,
a
violent
knocking
be
hear
at
the
door
,
and
presently
afterwards
Colonel
James
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
after
proper
compliment
have
past
,
the
colonel
tell
Amelia
that
her
letter
be
bring
to
Mrs.
James
while
they
be
at
table
,
and
that
on
her
shewing
it
him
he
have
immediately
rise
up
,
make
an
apology
to
his
company
,
and
take
a
chair
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
speak
to
her
with
great
tenderness
on
the
occasion
,
and
desire
her
to
make
herself
easy
;
assure
her
that
he
would
leave
nothing
in
his
power
undone
to
serve
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
then
give
her
an
invitation
,
in
his
wife
's
name
,
to
his
own
house
,
in
the
most
pressing
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
return
him
very
hearty
thank
for
all
his
kind
offer
,
but
beg
to
decline
that
of
an
apartment
in
his
house
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
as
she
could
not
leave
her
child
,
<EOS>
so
neither
could
she
think
of
bring
such
a
trouble
with
her
into
his
family
;
and
,
though
the
colonel
give
her
many
assurance
that
her
child
,
as
well
as
herself
,
would
be
very
welcome
to
Mrs.
James
,
and
even
betook
himself
to
entreaty
,
she
still
persist
obstinately
in
her
refusal
.
  
<EOS>
in
real
truth
,
Amelia
have
take
a
vast
affection
for
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
of
the
comfort
of
whose
company
she
could
not
bear
to
be
deprive
in
her
distress
,
nor
to
exchange
it
for
that
of
Mrs.
James
,
to
whom
she
have
lately
conceive
no
little
dislike
.
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
,
when
he
find
he
could
not
prevail
with
Amelia
to
accept
his
invitation
,
desist
from
any
farth
solicitation
.
<EOS>
He
then
take
a
bank
-
bill
of
fifty
pound
from
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
say
,
"
You
will
pardon
me
,
dear
madam
,
if
I
chuse
to
impute
your
refusal
of
my
house
rather
to
a
dislike
of
my
wife
,
who
I
will
not
pretend
to
be
the
most
agreeable
of
woman
<EOS>
(
all
man
,
"
say
he
,
sigh
,
"
have
not
Captain
Booth
's
fortune
)
,
than
to
any
aversion
or
anger
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
insist
upon
it
,
therefore
,
to
make
your
present
habitation
as
easy
to
you
as
possible
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
<EOS>
madam
,
you
will
not
deny
me
this
happiness
;
I
beg
you
will
honour
me
with
the
acceptance
of
this
trifle
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
put
the
note
into
her
hand
,
and
declare
that
the
honour
of
touch
it
be
worth
a
hundred
time
that
sum
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
protest
,
Colonel
James
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
blush
,
"
I
know
not
what
to
do
or
say
,
your
goodness
so
greatly
confound
me
.
<EOS>
Can
I
,
who
be
so
well
acquaint
with
the
many
great
obligation
Mr.
Booth
already
hath
to
your
generosity
,
consent
that
you
should
add
more
to
a
debt
we
never
can
pay
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
stopt
her
short
,
protest
that
she
misplace
the
obligation
;
for
,
that
if
to
confer
the
high
happiness
be
to
oblige
,
he
be
oblige
to
her
acceptance
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
do
assure
you
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
this
trifling
sum
or
a
much
large
can
contribute
to
your
ease
,
I
shall
consider
myself
as
the
happy
man
upon
earth
in
be
able
to
supply
it
,
and
you
,
madam
,
my
great
benefactor
in
receive
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
then
put
the
note
in
her
pocket
,
and
they
enter
into
a
conversation
in
which
many
civil
thing
be
say
on
both
side
;
but
what
be
chiefly
worth
remark
be
,
that
Amelia
have
almost
her
husband
constantly
in
her
mouth
,
and
the
colonel
never
mention
him
:
the
former
seem
desirous
to
lay
all
obligation
,
as
much
as
possible
,
to
the
account
of
her
husband
;
and
the
latter
endeavour
,
with
the
utmost
delicacy
,
to
insinuate
that
her
happiness
be
the
main
and
indeed
only
point
which
he
have
in
view
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
have
make
no
doubt
,
at
the
colonel
's
first
appearance
,
but
that
he
intend
to
go
directly
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
when
he
dropt
therefore
a
hint
of
his
intention
to
visit
him
next
morning
she
appear
visibly
shocked
at
the
delay
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
,
perceive
this
,
say
,
"
however
inconvenient
it
may
be
,
yet
,
madam
,
if
it
will
oblige
you
,
or
if
you
desire
it
,
I
will
even
go
to
-
night
.
"
<EOS>
Amelia
answer
,
"
My
husband
will
be
far
from
desire
to
derive
any
good
from
your
inconvenience
;
but
,
if
you
put
it
to
me
,
I
must
be
excuse
for
say
I
desire
nothing
more
in
the
world
than
to
send
him
so
great
a
comfort
as
I
know
he
will
receive
from
the
presence
of
such
a
friend
.
"
<EOS>
"
then
,
to
show
you
,
madam
,
"
cry
the
colonel
,
"
that
I
desire
nothing
more
in
the
world
than
to
give
you
pleasure
,
I
will
go
to
him
immediately
.
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
then
bethink
herself
of
the
serjeant
,
and
tell
the
colonel
his
old
acquaintance
<EOS>
Atkinson
,
whom
he
have
know
at
Gibraltar
,
be
then
in
the
house
,
and
would
conduct
him
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
the
serjeant
be
immediately
call
in
,
pay
his
respect
to
the
colonel
,
and
be
acknowledge
by
him
.
<EOS>
They
both
immediately
set
forward
,
Amelia
to
the
utmost
of
her
power
press
their
departure
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Atkinson
now
return
to
Amelia
,
and
be
by
her
acquaint
with
the
colonel
's
late
generosity
;
for
her
heart
so
boil
over
with
gratitude
that
she
could
not
conceal
the
ebullition
.
<EOS>
Amelia
likewise
give
her
friend
a
full
narrative
of
the
colonel
's
former
behaviour
and
friendship
to
her
husband
,
as
well
abroad
as
in
England
;
and
end
with
declare
that
she
believe
him
to
be
the
most
generous
man
upon
earth
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Atkinson
agree
with
Amelia
's
conclusion
,
and
say
she
be
glad
to
hear
there
be
any
such
man
.
<EOS>
They
then
proceed
with
the
child
to
the
tea
-
table
,
where
panegyric
,
and
not
scandal
,
be
the
topic
of
their
conversation
;
and
of
this
panegyric
the
colonel
be
the
subject
;
both
the
lady
seem
to
vie
with
each
other
in
celebrate
the
praise
of
his
goodness
.
    
<EOS>
comment
upon
author
.
 
<EOS>
have
leave
Amelia
in
as
comfortable
a
situation
as
could
possibly
be
expect
,
her
immediate
distress
relieve
,
and
her
heart
fill
with
great
hope
from
the
friendship
of
the
colonel
,
we
will
now
return
to
Booth
,
who
,
when
the
attorney
and
serjeant
have
leave
him
,
receive
a
visit
from
that
great
author
of
whom
honourable
mention
be
make
in
our
second
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
,
as
the
reader
may
be
pleased
to
remember
,
be
a
pretty
good
master
of
the
classic
;
for
his
father
,
though
he
design
his
son
for
the
army
,
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
breed
him
up
a
blockhead
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
,
perhaps
,
imagine
that
a
competent
share
of
latin
and
Greek
would
make
his
son
either
a
pedant
or
a
coward
.
<EOS>
He
consider
likewise
,
probably
,
that
the
life
of
a
soldier
be
in
general
a
life
of
idleness
;
and
may
think
that
the
spare
hour
of
an
officer
in
country
quarter
would
be
as
well
employ
with
a
book
as
in
saunter
about
the
street
,
loiter
in
a
coffee
-
house
,
sotte
in
a
tavern
,
or
in
lay
scheme
to
debauch
and
ruin
a
set
of
harmless
ignorant
country
girl
.
  
<EOS>
as
Booth
be
therefore
what
may
well
be
call
,
in
this
age
at
least
,
a
man
of
learning
,
he
begin
to
discourse
our
author
on
subject
of
literature
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
Dr
swift
hath
be
generally
allow
,
by
the
critic
in
this
kingdom
,
to
be
the
great
master
of
humour
that
ever
write
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
allow
him
to
have
possess
most
admirable
talent
of
this
kind
;
and
,
if
Rabelais
be
his
master
,
I
think
he
prove
the
truth
of
the
common
greek
proverb
 
that
the
scholar
be
often
superior
to
the
master
.
<EOS>
as
to
Cervantes
,
I
do
not
think
we
can
make
any
just
comparison
;
for
,
though
Mr.
Pope
compliment
him
with
sometimes
take
Cervantes
'
serious
air
<EOS>
"
"
I
remember
the
passage
,
"
cry
the
author
;
  
"
o
thou
,
whatever
title
<EOS>
please
thine
<EOS>
ear
,
Dean
,
Drapier
,
Bickerstaff
,
or
Gulliver
;
whether
you
take
Cervantes
'
serious
air
,
or
laugh
and
shake
in
Rabelais
'
easy
chair
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
sir
,
"
say
Booth
;
"
but
<EOS>
though
I
should
agree
that
the
doctor
hath
sometimes
condescend
to
imitate
Rabelais
,
I
do
not
remember
to
have
see
in
his
work
the
least
attempt
in
the
manner
of
Cervantes
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
in
his
own
way
,
and
whom
I
be
convince
he
study
above
all
other
 
<EOS>
you
guess
,
I
believe
,
I
be
go
to
name
Lucian
.
<EOS>
this
author
,
I
say
,
I
be
convinced
,
he
follow
;
but
I
think
he
follow
him
at
a
distance
:
as
,
to
say
the
truth
,
every
other
writer
of
this
kind
hath
do
in
my
opinion
;
for
none
,
I
think
,
hath
yet
equal
him
.
<EOS>
I
agree
,
indeed
,
entirely
with
Mr.
Moyle
,
in
his
discourse
on
the
age
of
the
Philopatris
,
when
he
give
him
the
epithet
of
the
incomparable
Lucian
;
and
incomparable
,
I
believe
,
he
will
remain
as
long
as
the
language
in
which
he
write
shall
endure
.
<EOS>
what
an
inimitable
piece
of
humour
be
his
Cock
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
very
well
,
"
cry
the
author
;
"
his
story
of
a
Cock
and
a
Bull
be
excellent
.
"
<EOS>
Booth
stare
at
this
,
and
ask
the
author
what
he
mean
by
the
Bull
?
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
"
answer
he
,
"
I
do
not
know
very
well
,
upon
my
soul
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
time
since
I
read
him
.
<EOS>
I
learn
him
all
over
at
school
;
I
have
not
read
him
much
since
.
<EOS>
and
pray
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
how
do
you
like
his
Pharsalia
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
Mr.
Rowe
's
translation
a
very
fine
one
?
"
<EOS>
Booth
reply
,
"
I
believe
we
be
talk
of
different
author
.
<EOS>
the
Pharsalia
,
which
Mr.
Rowe
translate
,
be
write
by
Lucan
;
but
I
have
be
speak
of
Lucian
,
a
greek
writer
,
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
great
in
the
humorous
way
that
ever
the
world
produce
.
"
<EOS>
"
ay
!
"
cry
the
author
,
"
he
be
indeed
so
,
a
very
excellent
writer
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
fancy
a
translation
of
him
would
sell
very
well
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
indeed
,
"
cry
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
a
good
translation
of
him
would
be
a
valuable
book
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
wretched
one
publish
by
Mr.
Dryden
,
but
translate
by
other
,
who
in
many
place
have
misunderstood
Lucian
's
meaning
,
and
have
nowhere
preserve
the
spirit
of
the
original
.
"
<EOS>
"
that
be
great
pity
,
"
say
the
author
.
<EOS>
"
pray
,
sir
,
be
he
well
translate
in
the
French
?
"
<EOS>
Booth
answer
,
he
could
not
tell
;
but
that
he
doubt
it
very
much
,
have
never
see
a
good
version
into
that
language
out
of
the
Greek
.
"
<EOS>
to
confess
the
truth
,
I
believe
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
french
translator
have
generally
consult
the
Latin
only
;
which
,
in
some
of
the
few
greek
writer
I
have
read
,
be
intolerably
bad
.
<EOS>
and
as
the
english
translator
,
for
the
most
part
,
pursue
the
French
,
we
may
easily
guess
what
spirit
those
copy
of
bad
copy
must
preserve
of
the
original
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
egad
,
you
be
a
shrewd
guesser
,
"
cry
the
author
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
the
bookseller
have
not
your
sagacity
.
<EOS>
but
how
should
it
be
otherwise
,
consider
the
price
they
pay
by
the
sheet
?
<EOS>
the
Greek
,
you
will
allow
,
be
a
hard
language
;
and
there
be
few
gentleman
that
write
who
can
read
it
without
a
good
lexicon
.
<EOS>
now
,
sir
,
if
we
be
to
afford
time
to
find
out
the
true
meaning
of
word
,
a
gentleman
would
not
get
bread
and
cheese
by
his
work
.
<EOS>
if
one
be
to
be
pay
,
indeed
,
as
Mr.
Pope
be
for
his
Homer
 
Pray
,
sir
,
do
not
you
think
that
the
good
translation
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
I
think
,
though
it
be
certainly
a
noble
paraphrase
,
and
of
itself
a
fine
poem
,
yet
in
some
place
it
be
no
translation
at
all
.
<EOS>
in
the
very
beginning
,
for
instance
,
he
hath
not
render
the
true
force
of
the
author
.
<EOS>
homer
invoke
his
muse
in
the
five
first
line
of
the
Iliad
;
and
,
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
,
he
give
his
reason
:
     
[
Greek
]
  
<EOS>
for
all
these
thing
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
bring
about
by
the
decree
of
Jupiter
;
and
,
therefore
,
he
suppose
their
true
source
be
know
only
to
the
deity
.
<EOS>
now
,
the
translation
take
no
more
notice
of
the
[
Greek
]
than
if
no
such
word
have
be
there
.

"
  
<EOS>

very
possibly
,

answer
the
author
;
"
it
be
a
long
time
since
I
read
the
original

<EOS>
perhaps
,
then
,
he
follow
the
french
translation
.
<EOS>
I
observe
,
indeed
,
he
talk
much
in
the
note
of
Madam
Dacier

Monsieur
Eustathius
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
have
now
receive
conviction
enough
of
his
friend
's
knowledge
of
the
greek
language
;
without
attempt
,
therefore
,
to
set
him
right
,
he
make
a
sudden
transition
to
the
Latin

<EOS>
"
pray

he
,
"
as
you
have
mention
Rowe

<EOS>
Booth
be
by
this
pretty
well
satisfied
of
the
author
's
profound
learning
;
however
,
he
be
willing
to
try
him
a
little
farther
.

He
ask
him
,
therefore
,
what
be
his
opinion
of
Lucan
in
general
,

in
what
class
of
writer
he
rank
him
?
  
<EOS>
the
author
stare
a
little
at
this
question
;
and
,
after
some
hesitation
,
answer
,
"
certainly
,
sir

I
think
he
be
a
fine
writer

a
very
great

I
be

of

if
he
be
not
to

place
in
the
first
rank
with

I
think
clearly
he
be
at

I
allow
to
each

,
perhaps
,
an
epic

be
beyond
the
genius

I
own

I
have
often
think
,
if
Statius
have
venture
no
farther
than
Ovid

Claudian
,
he
would
have
succeed
better

much
well

I

<EOS>

I
have
not
alter
it

answer
the

but
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
have
not
any
opinion
at
all
about
these
matter
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
trouble
my
head
much
with
poetry
;
for
there
be
no
encouragement
to
such
study
in
this
age

<EOS>
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
I
have
now
and
then
write
a
poem
or
two
for
the
magazine
,
but
I
never
intend
to
write
any
more

be
not

<EOS>
a
sheet
be
a
sheet
with
the

;
and
,
whether
it
be
in
prose

verse
,
they
make
no
difference

certainly
there
be
as
much
difference
to

there

sometimes
long

I
have
be
in
write

applause

confirm
that
,

Booth

for
I
protest
it
be
an
entire
secret
to
me
till
this
day

<EOS>
I

off

<EOS>
in

the

of

scarce
care

it

certainly
the
easy
work
in

you
may
write

almost
as
fast

you
can
set
pen
to
paper
;

if
you
interlard
it
with
a
little
scandal

a
little
abuse
on
some
live
character

you
can

you
have
greatly
instruct
me

could
not

imagine
there
have
be
so
much
regularity
in

you
be
pleased

mention

what
I
can
perceive

the

five

solicit

my
new
translation
of
Ovid
's
metamorphosis

with
note
explanatory
,
historical
,
and
critical
;
and
I
have
scarce
collect
five
hundred
name
yet

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
mention
of
this
translation
a
little
surprize
Booth
;
not
only
as
the
author
have
just
declare
his
intention
to
forsake
the
tuneful
muse
;
but
,
for
some
other
reason
which
he
have
collect
from
his
conversation
with
our
author
,
he
little
expect
to
hear
of
a
proposal
to
translate
any
of
the
latin
poet
.
<EOS>
He
proceed
,
therefore
,
to
catechise
him
a
little
farther
;
and
by
his
answer
be
fully
satisfied
that
he
have
the
very
same
acquaintance
with
Ovid
that
he
have
appear
to
have
with
Lucan
.
  
<EOS>
the
author
then
pull
out
a
bundle
of
paper
contain
proposal
for
his
subscription
,
and
receipt
;
and
,
address
himself
to
Booth
,
say
,
"
though
the
place
in
which
we
meet
,
sir
,
be
an
improper
place
to
solicit
favour
of
this
kind
,
yet
,
perhaps
,
it
may
be
in
your
power
to
serve
me
if
you
will
charge
your
pocket
with
some
of
these
.

"
<EOS>
Booth
be
just
offer
at
an
excuse
,
when
the
bailiff
introduce
Colonel
James
and
the
serjeant
.
  
<EOS>
the
unexpected
visit
of
a
beloved
friend
to
a
man
in
affliction
,
especially
in
Mr.
Booth
's
situation
,
be
a
comfort
which
can
scarce
be
equal
;
not
barely
from
the
hope
of
relief
or
redress
by
his
assistance
,
but
as
it
be
an
evidence
of
sincere
friendship
which
scarce
admit
of
any
doubt
or
suspicion
.
<EOS>
such
an
instance
doth
indeed
make
a
man
amend
for
all
ordinary
trouble
and
distress
;
and
we
ought
to
think
ourselves
gainer
by
have
have
such
an
opportunity
of
discover
that
we
be
possess
of
one
of
the
most
valuable
of
all
human
possession
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
so
transport
at
the
sight
of
the
colonel
,
that
he
dropt
the
proposal
which
the
author
have
put
into
his
hand
,
and
burst
forth
into
the
high
profession
of
gratitude
to
his
friend
;
who
behave
very
properly
on
his
side
,
and
say
everything
which
become
the
mouth
of
a
friend
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
he
seem
not
move
equally
either
with
Booth
or
the
serjeant
,
both
whose
eye
water
at
the
scene
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
the
colonel
,
though
a
very
generous
man
,
have
not
the
least
grain
of
tenderness
in
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
His
mind
be
form
of
those
firm
material
of
which
nature
formerly
hammer
out
the
Stoic
,
and
upon
which
the
sorrow
of
no
man
live
could
make
an
impression
.
<EOS>
a
man
of
this
temper
,
who
doth
not
much
value
danger
,
will
fight
for
the
person
he
call
his
friend
,
and
the
man
that
hath
but
little
value
for
his
money
will
give
it
him
;
but
such
friendship
be
never
to
be
absolutely
depend
on
;
for
,
whenever
the
favourite
passion
interpose
with
it
,
it
be
sure
to
subside
and
vanish
into
air
.
<EOS>
whereas
the
man
whose
tender
disposition
really
feel
the
misery
of
another
will
endeavour
to
relieve
them
for
his
own
sake
;
and
,
in
such
a
mind
,
friendship
will
often
get
the
superiority
over
every
other
passion
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
from
whatever
motive
it
spring
,
the
colonel
's
behaviour
to
Booth
seem
truly
amiable
;
and
so
it
appear
to
the
author
,
who
take
the
first
occasion
to
applaud
it
in
a
very
florid
oration
;
which
the
reader
,
when
he
recollect
that
he
be
a
speech
-
maker
by
profession
,
will
not
be
surprize
at
;
nor
,
perhaps
,
will
be
much
more
surprized
that
he
soon
after
take
an
occasion
of
clap
a
proposal
into
the
colonel
's
hand
,
hold
at
the
same
time
a
receipt
very
visible
in
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
receive
both
,
and
give
the
author
a
guinea
in
exchange
,
which
be
double
the
sum
mention
in
the
receipt
;
for
which
the
author
make
a
low
bow
,
and
very
politely
take
his
leave
,
say
,
"
I
suppose
,
gentleman
,
you
may
have
some
private
business
together
;
I
heartily
wish
a
speedy
end
to
your
confinement
,
and
I
congratulate
you
on
the
possessing
so
great
,
so
noble
,
and
so
generous
a
friend
.
"
    
<EOS>
which
incline
rather
to
satire
than
panegyric
.
 
<EOS>
the
colonel
have
the
curiosity
to
ask
Booth
the
name
of
the
gentleman
who
,
in
the
vulgar
language
,
have
strike
,
or
take
him
in
for
a
guinea
with
so
much
ease
and
dexterity
.
<EOS>
Booth
answer
,
he
do
not
know
his
name
;
all
that
he
know
of
him
be
,
that
he
be
the
most
impudent
and
illiterate
fellow
he
have
ever
see
,
and
that
,
by
his
own
account
,
he
be
the
author
of
most
of
the
wonderful
production
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
perhaps
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
may
look
uncharitable
in
me
to
blame
you
for
your
generosity
;
but
I
be
convince
the
fellow
hath
not
the
least
merit
or
capacity
,
and
you
have
subscribe
to
the
most
horrid
trash
that

into

fervent

himself

him
,

him
to

an
account
of
the

debt

horrid

<EOS>
Booth
answer
,
he
could
not
be
very
exact
,

he
fear
it
be
upwards
of
four

<EOS>
"
It
be

three
hundred

indeed

I

the

answer
he
be
mistaken
;
that
he
have
compute
his

they
amount
to
upward

nay

that

writ

whether
your

the
present
business
be
to
give
bail
only

then
you
will
have
some
time
to
try
your

I
think
you
may
get
a
company
abroad

then
I
would
advance
the
money
on

half
your

Whilst
Booth
pour
forth
his

you

I
be
well
known
to
be
responsible
for
a
much
large
sum

your

do
for

<EOS>
"
You
need
very
little
time

the

I
can
send
for
several
of

hath
the

well

what
harm

I

I
be
sure
I

the

be
more
easily
pacify

be
expect

tell
the

that

if
it
be
against
the
rule
of
law
to
discharge
Mr.

that
evening

he
must
be
content

<EOS>
He
then
address
himself
to
his
friend

and
begin
to
prescribe
comfort
and
patience
to
him
;
say
,
he
must
rest
satisfied
with
his
confinement
that
night

the
next
morning
he
promise

visit
him
again

Booth
answer

that
as
for
himself
,
the
lie
one
night

be
very
little
worth

<EOS>
"
You

I
,
my
dear
friend

have
both
spend
our
evening
in
a
bad
situation
than
I
shall
in
this
house

all
my
concern

for
my
poor
Amelia

whose
suffering
on
account
of
my
absence
I
know

I
feel
with
unspeakable
tenderness

Could
I

easy

in
a
dungeon

"
  
<EOS>
"
give
yourself
no
concern
on
her
account
,
"
say
the
colonel
;
"
I
will
wait
on
her
myself
,
though
I
break
an
engagement
for
that
purpose
,
and
will
give
her
such
assurance
as
I
be
convinced
will
make
her
perfectly
easy

<EOS>
Booth
embrace
his
friend
,
and
,
weep
over
him
,
pay
his
acknowledgment
with
tear
for
all
his
goodness

<EOS>
in
word
,
indeed
,
he
be
not
able
to
thank
him
;
for
gratitude
,
join
with
his
other
passion
,
almost
choake
him
,
and
stopt
his
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
scene
in
which
nothing
past
worth
recount
,
the
colonel
bid
his
friend
good
night
,
and
leave
the
serjeant
with
him
,
make
the
good
of
his
way
back
to
Amelia
.
    
<EOS>
Worthy
a
very
serious
perusal
.
 
<EOS>
the
colonel
find
Amelia
sit
very
disconsolate
with
Mrs.
Atkinson
.
<EOS>
He
enter
the
room
with
an
air
of
great
gaiety
,
assure
Amelia
that
her
husband
be
perfectly
well
,
and
that
he
hope
the
next
day
he
would
again
be
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
be
a
little
comfort
at
this
account
,
and
vent
many
grateful
expression
to
the
colonel
for
his
unparalleled
friendship
,
as
she
be
pleased
to
call
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
however
,
help
give
way
soon
after
to
a
sigh
at
the
thought
of
her
husband
's
bondage
,
and
declare
that
night
would
be
the
long
she
have
ever
know
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
lady
,
madam
,
"
cry
the
colonel
,
"
must
endeavour
to
make
it
short
.
<EOS>
and
,
if
you
will
give
me
leave
,
I
will
join
in
the
same
endeavour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
,
after
some
more
consolatory
speech
,
the
colonel
attempt
to
give
a
gay
turn
to
the
discourse
,
and
say
,
"
I
be
engage
to
have
spend
this
evening
disagreeably
at
Ranelagh
,
with
a
set
of
company
I
do
not
like
.
<EOS>
how
vastly
be
I
oblige
to
you
,
<EOS>
dear
Mrs.
Booth
,
that
I
pass
it
so
infinitely
more
to
my
satisfaction
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
colonel
,
"
say
Amelia
,
"
I
be
convince
that
to
a
mind
so
rightly
turn
as
your
there
must
be
a
much
sweet
relish
in
the
high
office
of
friendship
than
in
any
pleasure
which
the
gay
public
place
can
afford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
madam
,
"
say
the
colonel
,
"
you
now
do
me
more
than
justice
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
and
always
have
,
the
utmost
indifference
for
such
pleasure
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
hardly
allow
them
worthy
of
that
name
,
or
,
if
they
be
so
at
all
,
it
be
in
a
very
low
degree
.
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
the
high
friendship
must
always
lead
us
to
the
high
pleasure
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Amelia
enter
into
a
long
dissertation
on
friendship
,
in
which
she
point
several
time
directly
at
the
colonel
as
the
hero
of
her
tale
.
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
highly
applaud
all
her
sentiment
;
and
when
he
could
not
avoid
take
the
compliment
to
himself
,
he
receive
it
with
a
most
respectful
bow
.
<EOS>
He
then
try
his
hand
likewise
at
description
,
in
which
he
find
mean
to
repay
all
Amelia
's
panegyric
in
kind
.
<EOS>
this
,
though
he
do
with
all
possible
delicacy
,
yet
a
curious
observer
may
have
be
apt
to
suspect
that
it
be
chiefly
on
her
account
that
the
colonel
have
avoid
the
masquerade
.
  
<EOS>
in
discourse
of
this
kind
they
pass
the
evening
,
till
it
be
very
late
,
the
colonel
never
offer
to
stir
from
his
chair
before
the
clock
have
strike
one
;
when
he
think
,
perhaps
,
that
decency
oblige
him
to
take
his
leave
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
be
go
Mrs.
Atkinson
say
to
Mrs.
Booth
,
"
I
think
,
madam
,
you
tell
me
this
afternoon
that
the
colonel
be
marry
?
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
answer
,
she
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
likewise
,
madam
,
"
say
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
"
you
be
acquaint
with
the
colonel
's
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
answer
that
she
have
be
extremely
intimate
with
her
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
she
young
and
handsome
?
"
say
Mrs.
Atkinson
.
<EOS>
"
in
short
,
pray
,
be
it
a
match
of
love
or
convenience
?
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
answer
,
entirely
of
love
,
she
believe
,
on
his
side
;
for
that
the
lady
have
little
or
no
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
say
Mrs.
Atkinson
;
"
for
I
be
sure
the
colonel
be
in
love
with
somebody
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
see
a
more
luscious
picture
of
love
draw
than
that
which
he
be
pleased
to
give
us
as
the
portraiture
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
I
have
read
,
indeed
,
of
Pylades
and
Orestes
,
Damon
and
Pythias
,
and
other
great
friend
of
old
;
nay
,
I
sometimes
flatter
myself
that
I
be
capable
of
be
a
friend
myself
;
but
as
for
that
fine
,
soft
,
tender
,
delicate
passion
,
which
he
be
pleased
to
describe
,
I
be
convince
there
must
go
a
he
and
a
she
to
the
composition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
my
dear
,
you
be
mistaken
,
"
cry
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
know
the
friendship
which
hath
always
subsist
between
the
colonel

you
would
not

it
possible
for
any
description
to
exceed
it
.
<EOS>
nay
,
I
think
his
behaviour
this
very
day
be
sufficient
to
convince
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
own
what
he
hath
do
to
-
day
hath
great
merit
,
"
say
Mrs.
Atkinson
;
"
and
yet
,
from
what
he
hath
say
to
-
night
 
You
will
pardon
me
,
dear
madam
;
perhaps
I
be
too
quick
-
sighted
in
my
observation
;
nay
,
I
be
afraid
I
be
even
impertinent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
fie
upon
it
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Amelia
;
"
how
can
you
talk
in
that
strain
?
<EOS>
do
you
imagine
I
expect
ceremony
?
<EOS>
pray
speak
what
you
think
with
the
utmost
freedom
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
do
he
not
then
,
"
say
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
"
repeat
the
word
,
the
fine
woman
in
the
world
,
more
than
once
?
<EOS>
do
he
not
make
use
of
an
expression
which
may
have
become
the
mouth
of
Oroondates
himself
?
<EOS>
if
I
remember
,
the
word
be
these
 
that
,
have
he
be
Alexander
the
great
<EOS>
,
he
should
have
think
it
more
glory
to
have
wipe
off
a
tear
from
the
bright
eye
of
Statira
than
to
have
conquer
fifty
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
say
so
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Amelia
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
do
say
something
like
it
;
but
my
thought
be
so
full
of
my
husband
that
I
take
little
notice
.
<EOS>
but
what
would
you
infer
from
what
he
say
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
do
not
think
he
be
in
love
with
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
doth
not
think
so
himself
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Atkinson
;
"
though
,
when
he
mention
the
bright
eye
of
Statira
,
he
fix
his
own
eye
on
yours
with
the
most
languishing
air
I
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
be
go
to
answer
,
when
the
serjeant
arrive
,
and
then
she
immediately
fall
to
enquire
after
her
husband
,
and
receive
such
satisfactory
answer
to
all
her
many
question
concern
him
,
that
she
express
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
these
idea
so
possess
her
mind
,
that
,
without
once
cast
her
thought
on
any
other
matter
,
she
take
her
leave
of
the
serjeant
and
his
lady
,
and
repair
to
bed
to
her
child
,
in
a
room
which
Mrs.
Atkinson
have
provide
her
in
the
same
house
;
where
we
will
at
present
wish
her
a
good
night
.
    
<EOS>
consist
of
grave
matter
.
 
<EOS>
while
innocence
and
chearful
hope
,
in
spite
of
the
malice
of
fortune
,
close
the
eye
of
the
gentle
Amelia
on
her
homely
bed
,
and
she
enjoy
a
sweet
and
profound
sleep
,
the
colonel
lie
restless
all
night
on
his
down
;
his
mind
be
affect
with
a
kind
of
ague
fit
;
sometimes
scorch
up
with
flaming
desire
,
and
again
chill
with
the
cold
despair
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
time
,
I
think
,
accord
to
one
of
our
poet
,
when
lust
and
envy
sleep
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
suppose
,
be
when
they
be
well
gorged
with
the
food
they
most
delight
in
;
but
,
while
either
of
these
be
hungry
,
        
nor
poppy
,
nor
mandragora
,
      
nor
all
the
drousy
syrup
of
the
East
,
      
Will
ever
medicine
them
to
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
be
at
present
unhappily
torment
by
both
these
fiend
.
<EOS>
His
last
evening
's
conversation
with
Amelia
have
do
his
business
effectually
.
<EOS>
the
many
kind
word
she
have
speak
to
him
,
the
many
kind
look
she
have
give
him
,
as
be
,
she
conceive
,
the
friend
and
preserver
of
her
husband
,
have
make
an
entire
conquest
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
thus
the
very
love
which
she
bear
him
,
as
the
person
to
whom
her
little
family
be
to
owe
their
preservation
and
happiness
,
inspire
him
with
thought
of
sink
them
all
in
the
low
abyss
of
ruin
and
misery
;
and
,
while
she
smile
with
all
her
sweetness
on
the
suppose
friend
of
her
husband
,
she
be
convert
that
friend
into
his
most
bitter
enemy
.
        
<EOS>
Friendship
,
take
heed
;
if
woman
interfere
,
      
be
sure
the
hour
of
thy
destruction
be
near
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
line
of
Vanbrugh
;
and
the
sentiment
be
well
than
the
poetry
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
as
a
handsome
wife
be
the
cause
and
cement
of
many
false
friendship
,
she
be
often
too
liable
to
destroy
the
real
one
.
  
<EOS>
thus
the
object
of
the
colonel
's
lust
very
plainly
appear
,
but
the
object
of
his
envy
may
be
more
difficult
to
discover
.
<EOS>
Nature
and
Fortune
have
seem
to
strive
with
a
kind
of
rivalship
which
should
bestow
most
on
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
the
former
have
give
him
person
,
part
,
and
constitution
,
in
all
which
he
be
superior
to
almost
every
other
man
.
<EOS>
the
latter
have
give
him
rank
in
life
,
and
rich
,
both
in
a
very
eminent
degree
.
<EOS>
whom
then
should
this
happy
man
envy
?
<EOS>
here
,
l
ambition
should
mislead
the
reader
to
search
the
palace
of
the
great
,
we
will
direct
him
at
once
to
Gray's
-
inn
-
lane
;
where
,
in
a
miserable
bed
,
in
a
miserable
room
,
he
will
see
a
miserable
break
lieutenant
,
in
a
miserable
condition
,
with
several
heavy
debt
on
his
back
,
and
without
a
penny
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
this
,
and
no
other
,
be
the
object
of
the
colonel
's
envy
.
<EOS>
and
why
?
<EOS>
because
this
wretch
be
possess
of
the
affection
of
a
poor
little
lamb
,
which
all
the
vast
flock
that
be
within
the
power
and
reach
of
the
colonel
could
not
prevent
that
glutton
's
longing
for
.
<EOS>
and
sure
this
image
of
the
lamb
be
not
improperly
adduce
on
this
occasion
;
for
what
be
the
colonel
's
desire
but
to
lead
this
poor
lamb
,
as
it
be
,
to
the
slaughter
,
in
order
to
purchase
a
feast
of
a
few
day
by
her
final
destruction
,
and
to
tear
her
away
from
the
arm
of
one
where
she
be
sure
of
be
fondle
and
caress
all
the
day
of
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
colonel
be
agitate
with
these
thought
,
his
great
comfort
be
,
that
Amelia
and
Booth
be
now
separate
;
and
his
great
terror
be
of
their
come
again
together
.
<EOS>
from
wish
,
therefore
,
he
begin
to
meditate
design
;
and
so
far
be
he
from
any
intention
of
procure
the
liberty
of
his
friend
,
that
he
begin
to
form
scheme
of
prolong
his
confinement
,
till
he
could
procure
some
mean
of
send
him
away
far
from
her
;
in
which
case
he
doubt
not
but
of
succeed
in
all
he
desire
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
form
this
plan
in
his
mind
when
a
servant
inform
him
that
one
serjeant
Atkinson
desire
to
speak
with
his
honour
.
<EOS>
the
serjeant
be
immediately
admit
,
and
acquaint
the
colonel
that
,
if
he
please
to
go
and
become
bail
for
Mr.
Booth
,
another
unexceptionable
housekeeper
would
be
there
to
join
with
him
.
<EOS>
this
person
the
serjeant
have
procure
that
morning
,
and
have
,
by
leave
of
his
wife
,
give
him
a
bond
of
indemnification
for
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
do
not
seem
so
elated
with
this
news
as
Atkinson
expect
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
instead
of
make
a
direct
answer
to
what
Atkinson
say
,
the
colonel
begin
thus
:
"
I
think
,
serjeant
,
Mr.
Booth
hath
tell
me
that
you
be
foster
-
brother
to
his
lady
.
<EOS>
She
be
really
a
charming
woman
,
and
it
be
a
thousand
pity
she
should
ever
have
be
place
in
the
dreadful
situation
she
be
now
in
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
so
silly
as
for
subaltern
officer
of
the
army
to
marry
,
unless
where
they
meet
with
woman
of
very
great
fortune
indeed
.
<EOS>
what
can
be
the
event
of
their
marrying
otherwise
,
but
entail
misery
and
beggary
on
their
wife
and
their
posterity
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
sir
,
"
cry
the
serjeant
,
"
it
be
too
late
to
think
of
those
matter
now
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
my
lady
may
have
marry
one
of
the
top
gentleman
in
the
country
;
for
she
be
certainly
one
of
the
good
as
well
as
one
of
the
handsome
woman
in
the
kingdom
;
and
,
if
she
have
be
fairly
deal
by
,
would
have
have
a
very
great
fortune
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
be
worthy
of
the
great
prince
in
the
world
;
and
,
if
I
have
be
the
great
prince
in
the
world
,
I
should
have
think
myself
happy
with
such
a
wife
;
but
she
be
pleased
to
like
the
lieutenant
,
and
certainly
there
can
be
no
happiness
in
marriage
without
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lookee
,
serjeant
,
"
say
the
colonel
;
<EOS>
"
you
know
very
well
that
I
be
the
lieutenant
's
friend
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
shew
myself
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
your
honour
hath
,
"
quoth
the
serjeant
,
"
more
than
once
to
my
knowledge
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
angry
with
him
for
his
imprudence
,
greatly
angry
with
him
for
his
imprudence
;
and
the
more
so
,
as
it
affect
a
lady
of
so
much
worth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
,
indeed
,
a
lady
of
the
high
worth
,
"
cry
the
serjeant
.
"
<EOS>
poor
dear
lady
!
<EOS>
I
know
her
,
an
"
t
please
your
honour
,
from
her
infancy
;
and
the
sweetest
-
temper
,
best
-
natured
lady
<EOS>
she
be
that
ever
trod
on
english
ground
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
love
her
as
if
she
be
my
own
sister
.
<EOS>
nay
,
she
hath
very
often
call
me
brother
;
and
I
have
take
it
to
be
a
great
honour
than
if
I
be
to
be
call
a
general
officer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
pity
it
be
,
"
say
the
colonel
,
"
that
this
worthy
creature
should
be
expose
to
so
much
misery
by
the
thoughtless
behaviour
of
a
man
who
,
though
I
be
his
friend
,
I
can
not
help
say
,
hath
be
guilty
of
imprudence
at
least
!
<EOS>
why
could
he
not
live
upon
his
half
-
pay
?
<EOS>
what
have
he
to
do
to
run
himself
into
debt
in
this
outrageous
manner
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
wish
,
indeed
,
"
cry
the
serjeant
,
"
he
have
be
a
little
more
considerative
;
but
I
hope
this
will
be
a
warning
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
I
sure
of
that
,
"
answer
the
colonel
;
"
or
what
reason
be
there
to
expect
it
?
<EOS>
extravagance
be
a
vice
of
which
man
be
not
so
easily
cure
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
a
great
deal
of
this
matter
,
Mr.
serjeant
;
and
,
upon
the
most
mature
deliberation
,
I
be
of
opinion
that
it
will
be
well
,
both
for
him
and
his
poor
lady
,
that
he
should
smart
a
little
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
honour
,
sir
,
to
be
sure
be
in
the
right
,
"
reply
the
serjeant
;
"
but
<EOS>
yet
,
sir
,
if
you
will
pardon
me
for
speak
,
I
hope
you
will
be
pleased
to
consider
my
poor
lady
's
case
.
<EOS>
She
suffer
,
all
this
while
,
as
much
or
more
than
the
lieutenant
;
for
I
know
her
so
well
,
that
I
be
certain
she
will
never
have
a
moment
's
ease
<EOS>
till
her
husband
be
out
of
confinement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
woman
better
than
you
,
serjeant
,
"
cry
the
colonel
;
"
they
sometimes
place
their
affection
on
a
husband
as
child
do
on
their
nurse
;
but
they
be
both
to
be
wean
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
,
serjeant
,
to
be
a
fellow
of
sense
as
well
as
spirit
,
or
I
should
not
speak
so
freely
to
you
;
but
I
take
a
fancy
to
you
a
long
time
ago
,
and
I
intend
to
serve
you
;
but
first
,
I
ask
you
this
question
 
<EOS>
be
your
attachment
to
Mr.
Booth
or
his
lady
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
sir
,
"
say
the
serjeant
,
"
I
must
love
my
lady
best
.
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
great
affection
for
the
lieutenant
too
,
because
I
know
my
lady
hath
<EOS>
the
same
;
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
he
hath
be
always
very
good
to
me
as
far
as
be
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
a
lieutenant
,
your
honour
know
,
can
not
do
a
great
deal
;
but
I
have
always
find
him
my
friend
upon
all
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
true
,
"
cry
the
colonel
;
"
a
lieutenant
can
do
but
little
;
but
I
can
do
much
to
serve
you
,
and
will
too
.
<EOS>
but
let
me
ask
you
one
question
:
who
be
the
lady
whom
I
see
last
night
with
Mrs.
Booth
at
her
lodging
?
"
  
<EOS>
here
the
serjeant
blush
,
and
repeat
,
"
the
lady
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
a
lady
,
a
woman
,
"
cry
the
colonel
,
"
who
sup
with
us
last
night
.
<EOS>
She
look
rather
too
much
like
a
gentlewoman
for
the
mistress
of
a
lodging
-
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
serjeant
's
cheek
glow
at
this
compliment
to
his
wife
;
and
he
be
just
go
to
own
her
when
the
colonel
proceed
:
"
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
see
in
my
life
<EOS>
so
ill

looking

sly

demure
a
b

;
I
would
give
something
,
methink
,
to
know
who
she
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
indeed
,
"
cry
the
serjeant
,
in
great
confusion
;
"
I
know
nothing
about
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
enquire
,
"
say
the
colonel
,
"
and
let
me
know
her
name
,
and
likewise
what
she
be
:
I
have
a
strange
curiosity
to
know
,
and
let
me
see
you
again
this
evening
exactly
at
seven
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
will
not
your
honour
then
go
to
the
lieutenant
this
morning

Atkinson

It

the

I

another

besides
,
there
be
no

in
this
affair

<EOS>
if
man
will
be
imprudent
they
must
suffer
the
consequence

come
to
me
at
seven

and
bring
me
all
the
particular
you
can
concern
that
ill

look

I
mention
to

for
I

resolve
to
know
who
she
be

<EOS>
and
so
good
-
morrow
to
you
,
serjeant
;
be
assure
I
will
take
an
opportunity
to
do
something
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
though
some
reader
may
,
perhaps
,
think
the
serjeant
not
unworthy
of
the
freedom
with
which
the
colonel
treat
him
;
yet
that
haughty
officer
would
have
be
very
backward
to
have
condescend
to
such
familiarity
with
one
of
his
rank
<EOS>
have
he
not
propose
some
design
from
it
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
he
begin
to
conceive
hope
of
make
the
serjeant
instrumental
to
his
design
on
Amelia
;
in
other
word
,
to
convert
him
into
a
pimp
;
an
office
in
which
the
colonel
have
be
serve
by
Atkinson
's
better
,
and
which
,
as
he
know
it
be
in
his
power
very
well
to
reward
him
,
he
have
no
apprehension
that
the
serjeant
would
decline
 
an
opinion
which
the
serjeant
may
have
pardon
,
though
he
have
never
give
the
least
ground
for
it
,
since
the
colonel
borrow
it
from
the
knowledge
of
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
this
dictate
to
him
that
he
,
from
a
bad
motive
,
be
capable
of
desire
to
debauch
his
friend
's
wife
;
and
the
same
heart
inspire
him
to
hope
that
another
,
from
another
bad
motive
,
may
be
guilty
of
the
same
breach
of
friendship
in
assist
him
.
<EOS>
few
man
,
I
believe
,
think
better
of
other
than
of
themselves
;
nor
do
they
easily
allow
the
existence
of
any
virtue
of
which
they
perceive
no
trace
in
their
own
mind
;
for
which
reason
I
have
observe
,
that
it
be
extremely
difficult
to
persuade
a
rogue
that
you
be
an
honest
man
;
nor
would
you
ever
succeed
in
the
attempt
by
the
strong
evidence
,
be
it
not
for
the
comfortable
conclusion
which
the
rogue
draw
,
that
he
who
prove
himself
to
be
honest
prove
himself
to
be
a
fool
at
the
same
time
.
    
<EOS>
a
curious
chapter
,
from
which
a
curious
reader
may
draw
sundry
observation
.
 
<EOS>
the
serjeant
retire
from
the
colonel
in
a
very
dejected
state
of
mind
:
in
which
,
however
,
we
must
leave
him
awhile
and
return
to
Amelia
;
who
,
as
soon
as
she
be
up
,
have
despatch
Mrs.
Atkinson
to
pay
off
her
former
lodging
,
and
to
bring
off
all
cloath
and
other
moveable
.
  
<EOS>
the
trusty
messenger
return
without
perform
her
errand
,
for
Mrs.
Ellison
have
lock
up
all
her
room
,
and
be
go
out
very
early
that
morning
,
and
the
servant
know
not
whither
she
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
lady
now
sit
down
to
breakfast
,
together
with
Amelia
's
two
child
;
after
which
,
Amelia
declare
she
would
take
a
coach
and
visit
her
husband
.
<EOS>
to
this
motion
Mrs.
Atkinson
soon
agree
,
and
offer
to
be
her
companion
.
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
I
think
it
be
reasonable
enough
;
and
the
great
abhorrence
which
Booth
have
of
see
his
wife
in
a
bailiff
's
house
be
,
perhaps
,
rather
too
nice
and
delicate
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
lady
be
both
dr
,
and
just
go
to
send
for
their
vehicle
,
a
great
knocking
be
hear
at
the
door
,
and
presently
Mrs.
James
be
usher
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
this
visit
be
disagreeable
enough
to
Amelia
,
as
it
detain
her
from
the
sight
of
her
husband
,
for
which
she
so
eagerly
long
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
she
have
no
doubt
but
that
the
visit
would
be
reasonably
short
,
she
resolve
to
receive
the
lady
with
all
the
complaisance
in
her
power
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
James
now
behave
herself
so
very
unlike
the
person
that
she
lately
appear
,
that
it
may
have
surprize
any
one
who
doth
not
know
that
besides
that
of
a
fine
lady
,
which
be
all
mere
art
and
mummery
,
every
such
woman
hath
some
real
character
at
the
bottom
,
in
which
,
whenever
nature
get
the
well
of
her
,
she
act
.
<EOS>
thus
the
fine
lady
in
the
world
will
sometimes
love
,
and
sometimes
scratch
,
accord
to
their
different
natural
disposition
,
with
great
fury
and
violence
,
though
both
of
these
be
equally
inconsistent
with
a
fine
lady
's
artificial
character
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
James
then
be
at
the
bottom
a
very
good
-
natured
woman
,
and
the
moment
she
hear
of
Amelia
's
misfortune
be
sincerely
grieve
at
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
acquiesce
on
the
very
first
motion
with
the
colonel
's
design
of
invite
her
to
her
house
;
and
this
morning
at
breakfast
,
when
he
have
acquaint
her
that
Amelia
make
some
difficulty
in
accept
the
offer
,
very
readily
undertook
to
go
herself
and
persuade
her
friend
to
accept
the
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
press
this
matter
with
such
earnestness
,
that
Amelia
,
who
be
not
extremely
verse
in
the
art
of
denying
,
be
hardly
able
to
refuse
her
importunity
;
nothing
,
indeed
,
but
<EOS>
her
affection
to
Mrs.
Atkinson
could
have
prevail
on
her
to
refuse
;
that
point
,
however
,
she
would
not
give
up
,
and
Mrs.
James
,
at
last
,
be
content
with
a
promise
that
,
as
soon
as
their
affair
be
settle
,
Amelia
,
with
her
husband
and
family
,
would
make
her
a
visit
,
and
stay
some
time
with
her
in
the
country
,
whither
<EOS>
she
be
soon
to
retire
.
  
<EOS>
have
obtain
this
promise
,
Mrs.
James
,
after
many
very
friendly
profession
,
take
her
leave
,
and
,
step
into
her
coach
,
reassume
the
fine
lady
,
and
drive
away
to
join
her
company
at
an
auction
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
she
be
go
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
who
have
leave
the
room
upon
the
approach
of
Mrs.
James
,
return
into
it
,
and
be
inform
by
Amelia
of
all
that
have
past
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
madam
,
"
say
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
"
do
this
colonel
and
his
lady
<EOS>
live
,
as
it
be
call
,
well
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
mean
to
ask
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
whether
they
be
a
very
fond
couple
,
I
must
answer
that
I
believe
they
be
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
tell
,
"
say
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
"
that
there
have
be
instance
of
woman
who
have
become
bawds
to
their
own
husband
,
and
the
husband
pimp
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
fie
upon
it
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
there
be
no
such
people
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
dear
,
this
be
be
a
little
too
censorious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
call
it
what
you
please
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Atkinson
;
"
it
arise
from
my
love
to
you
and
my
fear
for
your
danger
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
proverb
of
a
burn
child
;
and
,
if
such
a
one
hath
any
good
-
nature
,
it
will
dread
the
fire
on
the
account
of
other
as
well
as
on
its
own
.
<EOS>
and
,
if
I
may
speak
my
sentiment
freely
,
I
can
not
think
you
will
be
in
safety
at
this
colonel
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
but
believe
your
apprehension
to
be
sincere
,
"
reply
Amelia
;
"
and
I
must
think
myself
oblige
to
you
for
them
;
but
I
be
convinced
you
be
entirely
in
an
error
.
<EOS>
I
look
on
Colonel
James
as
the
most
generous
and
good
of
man
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
friend
,
and
an
excellent
friend
too
,
to
my
husband
,
long
before
I
be
acquaint
with
him
,
and
he
hath
do
him
a
thousand
good
office
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
of
his
behaviour
yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
wish
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
"
that
this
behaviour
to
-
day
have
be
equal
.
<EOS>
what
I
be
now
go
to
undertake
be
the
most
disagreeable
office
of
friendship
,
but
it
be
a
necessary
one
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
,
therefore
,
what
past
this
morning
between
the
colonel
and
Mr.
Atkinson
;
for
,
though
it
will
hurt
you
,
you
ought
,
on
many
account
,
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
she
relate
the
whole
,
which
we
have
record
in
the
precede
chapter
,
and
with
which
the
serjeant
have
acquaint
her
while
Mrs.
James
be
pay
her
visit
to
Amelia
.
<EOS>
and
,
as
the
serjeant
have
paint
the
matter
rather
in
strong
colour
than
the
colonel
,
so
Mrs.
Atkinson
again
a
little
improved
on
the
serjeant
.
<EOS>
neither
of
these
good
people
,
perhaps
,
intend
to
aggravate
any
circumstance
;
but
such
be
,
I
believe
,
the
unavoidable
consequence
of
all
report
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
indeed
,
may
be
suppose
not
to
see
what
relate
to
James
in
the
most
favourable
light
,
as
the
serjeant
,
with
more
honesty
than
prudence
,
have
suggest
to
his
wife
that
the
colonel
have
not
the
kind
opinion
of
her
,
and
have
call
her
a
sly
and
demure
 
<EOS>
:
it
be
true
<EOS>
he
omit
ill
-
look
b
#
#
#
#
;
two
word
which
be
,
perhaps
,
superior
to
the
patience
of
any
Job
in
petticoat
that
ever
live
.
<EOS>
He
make
amend
,
however
,
by
substitute
some
other
phrase
in
their
stead
,
not
extremely
agreeable
to
a
female
ear
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
to
Amelia
,
from
Mrs.
Atkinson
's
relation
,
that
the
colonel
have
grossly
abuse
Booth
to
the
serjeant
,
and
have
absolutely
refuse
to
become
his
bail
.
<EOS>
Poor
Amelia
become
a
pale
and
motionless
statue
at
this
account
.
<EOS>
at
length
she
cry
,
"
if
this
be
true
,
I
and
mine
be
all
,
indeed
,
undone
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
comfort
,
no
hope
,
<EOS>
no
friend
leave
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
disbelieve
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
would
not
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
why
should
you
,
indeed
,
deceive
me
?
<EOS>
but
what
can
have
cause
this
alteration
since
last
night
?
<EOS>
do
I
say
or
do
anything
to
offend
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
and
do
rather
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
a
great
deal
too
much
to
please
him
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Atkinson
.
<EOS>
"
besides
,
he
be
not
in
the
least
offended
with
you
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
say
many
kind
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
my
poor
love
have
do
?
"
say
Amelia
.
"
<EOS>
He
hath
not
see
the
colonel
since
last
night
.
<EOS>
some
villain
hath
set
him
against
my
husband
;
he
be
once
before
suspicious
of
such
a
person
.
<EOS>
some
cruel
monster
hath
belie
his
innocence
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
,
dear
madam
,
"
say
Mrs.
Atkinson
;
"
I
believe
the
person
who
hath
injure
the
captain
with
this
friend
of
his
be
one
of
the
worthy
and
good
of
creature
 
<EOS>
nay
,
do
not
be
surprize
;
the
person
I
mean
be
even
your
fair
self
:
sure
you
would
not
be
so
dull
in
any
other
case
;
but
in
this
,
gratitude
,
humility
,
modesty
,
every
virtue
,
shut
your
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Mortales
hebetant
visus
,
  
as
Virgil
say
.
<EOS>
what
in
the
world
can
be
more
consistent
than
his
desire
to
have
you
at
his
own
house
and
to
keep
your
husband
confine
in
another
?
<EOS>
all
that
he
say
and
all
that
he
do
yesterday
,
and
,
what
be
more
convincing
to
me
than
both
,
all
that
he
look
last
night
,
be
very
consistent
with
both
these
design
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
O
Heavens
!
<EOS>
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
you
chill
my
blood
with
horror
!
<EOS>
the
idea
freeze
me
to
death
;
I
can
not
,
must
not
,
will
not
think
it
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
conviction
!
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
ever
have
more
conviction
!
<EOS>
and
do
he
abuse
my
husband
?
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
do
he
abuse
a
poor
,
unhappy
,
distrest
creature
,
opprest
,
ruin
,
tear
from
his
child
,
tear
away
from
his
wretched
wife
;
the
honest
,
worthy
,
noblest
,
tender
,
fond
,
good
<EOS>
"
here
she
burst
into
an
agony
of
grief
,
which
exceed
the
power
of
description
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
situation
Mrs.
Atkinson
be
do
her
utmost
to
support
her
when
a
most
violent
knocking
be
hear
at
the
door
,
and
immediately
the
serjeant
run
hastily
into
the
room
,
bring
with
him
a
cordial
which
presently
relieve
Amelia
.
<EOS>
what
this
cordial
be
,
we
shall
inform
the
reader
in
due
time
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
while
he
must
suspend
his
curiosity
;
and
the
gentleman
at
White
's
may
lay
wager
whether
it
be
Ward
's
pill
or
Dr
James
's
powder
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
we
close
this
chapter
,
and
return
back
to
the
bailiff
's
house
,
we
must
do
our
good
to
rescue
the
character
of
our
heroine
from
the
dulness
of
apprehension
,
which
several
of
our
quick
-
sight
reader
may
lay
more
heavily
to
her
charge
than
be
do
by
her
friend
Mrs.
Atkinson
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
inform
,
therefore
,
all
such
reader
,
that
it
be
not
because
innocence
be
more
blind
than
guilt
that
the
former
often
overlook
and
tumble
into
the
pit
which
the
latter
foresee
and
avoid
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
it
be
almost
impossible
guilt
should
miss
the
discovering
of
all
the
snare
in
its
way
,
as
it
be
constantly
pry
closely
into
every
corner
in
order
to
lay
snare
for
other
.
<EOS>
whereas
innocence
,
have
no
such
purpose
,
walk
fearlessly
and
carelessly
through
life
,
and
be
consequently
liable
to
tread
on
the
gin
which
cunne
hath
lay
to
entrap
it
.
<EOS>
to
speak
plainly
and
without
allegory
or
figure
,
it
be
not
want
of
sense
,
but
want
of
suspicion
,
by
which
innocence
be
often
betray
.
<EOS>
again
,
we
often
admire
at
the
folly
of
the
dupe
,
when
we
should
transfer
our
whole
surprize
to
the
astonishing
guilt
of
the
betrayer
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
many
an
innocent
person
hath
owe
his
ruin
to
this
circumstance
alone
,
that
the
degree
of
villany
be
such
as
must
have
exceed
the
faith
of
every
man
who
be
not
himself
a
villain
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
be
many
profound
secret
of
philosophy
.
 
<EOS>
Booth
,
have
have
enough
of
the
author
's
company
the
precede
day
,
choose
now
another
companion
.
<EOS>
indeed
the
author
be
not
very
solicitous
of
a
second
interview
;
for
,
as
he
could
have
no
hope
from
Booth
's
pocket
,
so
he
be
not
likely
to
receive
much
increase
to
his
vanity
from
Booth
's
conversation
;
for
,
low
as
this
wretch
be
in
virtue
,
sense
,
learning
,
birth
,
and
fortune
,
he
be
by
no
means
low
in
his
vanity
.
<EOS>
this
passion
,
indeed
,
be
so
high
in
him
,
and
at
the
same
time
so
blind
him
to
his
own
demerit
,
that
he
hate
every
man
who
do
not
either
flatter
him
or
give
him
money
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
claim
a
strange
kind
of
right
,
either
to
cheat
all
his
acquaintance
of
their
praise
or
to
pick
their
pocket
of
their
penny
,
in
which
latter
case
he
himself
repay
very
liberally
with
panegyric
.
  
<EOS>
a
very
little
speciman
of
such
a
fellow
must
have
satisfy
a
man
of
Mr.
Booth
's
temper
.
<EOS>
He
choose
,
therefore
,
now
to
associate
himself
with
that
gentleman
of
whom
Bondum
have
give
so
shabby
a
character
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
Mr.
Booth
's
opinion
of
the
bailiff
be
such
,
that
he
recommend
a
man
most
where
he
least
intend
it
.
<EOS>
nay
,
the
bailiff
in
the
present
instance
,
though
he
have
draw
a
malicious
conclusion
,
honestly
avow
that
this
be
draw
only
from
the
poverty
of
the
person
,
which
be
never
,
I
believe
,
any
forcible
disrecommendation
to
a
good
mind
:
but
he
must
have
have
a
very
bad
mind
indeed
,
who
,
in
Mr.
Booth
's
circumstance
,
could
have
dislike
or
despise
another
man
because
that
other
man
be
poor
.
  
<EOS>
some
previous
conversation
have
past
between
this
gentleman
and
Booth
,
in
which
they
have
both
open
their
several
situation
to
each
other
,
the
former
,
cast
an
affectionate
look
on
the
latter
,
expr
great
compassion
for
his
circumstance
,
for
which
Booth
,
thank
him
,
say
,
"
You
must
have
a
great
deal
of
compassion
,
and
be
a
very
good
man
,
in
such
a
terrible
situation
as
you
describe
yourself
,
to
have
any
pity
to
spare
for
other
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
affair
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
gentleman
,
"
be
very
bad
,
it
be
true
,
and
yet
there
be
one
circumstance
which
make
you
appear
to
me
more
the
object
of
pity
than
I
be
to
myself
;
and
it
be
this
 
that
you
must
from
your
year
be
a
novice
in
affliction
,
whereas
I
have
serve
a
long
apprenticeship
to
misery
,
and
ought
,
by
this
time
,
to
be
a
pretty
good
master
of
my
trade
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
believe
habit
teach
man
to
bear
the
burthen
of
the
mind
,
as
it
inure
them
to
bear
heavy
burthen
on
their
shoulder
.
<EOS>
without
use
and
experience
,
the
strong
mind
and
body
both
will
stagger
under
a
weight
which
habit
may
render
easy
and
even
contemptible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
great
justice
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
in
the
comparison
;
and
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
myself
experience
the
truth
of
it
;
for
I
be
not
that
tyro
in
affliction
which
you
seem
to
apprehend
me
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
it
be
from
the
very
habit
you
mention
that
I
be
able
to
support
my
present
misfortune
a
little
like
a
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
smile
at
this
,
and
cry
,
"
indeed
,
captain
,
you
be
a
young
philosopher
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
I
have
some
pretension
to
that
philosophy
which
be
teach
by
misfortune
,
and
you
seem
to
be
of
opinion
,
sir
,
that
be
one
of
the
good
school
of
philosophy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
no
more
,
sir
,
"
say
the
gentleman
,
"
than
that
in
the
day
of
our
affliction
we
be
inclined
to
think
more
seriously
than
in
those
season
of
life
when
we
be
engage
in
the
hurrying
pursuit
of
business
or
pleasure
,
when
we
have
neither
leisure
nor
inclination
to
sift
and
examine
thing
to
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
now
there
be
two
consideration
which
,
from
my
have
long
fix
my
thought
upon
them
,
have
greatly
support
me
under
all
my
affliction
.
<EOS>
the
one
be
the
brevity
of
life
even
at
its
long
duration
,
which
the
wise
of
man
hath
compare
to
the
short
dimension
of
a
span
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
roman
poet
compare
it
to
the
duration
of
a
race
;
and
another
,
to
the
much
short
transition
of
a
wave
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
second
consideration
be
the
uncertainty
of
it
.
<EOS>
short
as
its
utmost
limit
be
,
it
be
far
from
be
assure
of
reach
those
limit
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
the
next
hour
,
the
next
moment
,
may
be
the
end
of
our
course
.
<EOS>
now
of
what
value
be
so
uncertain
,
so
precarious
a
station
?
<EOS>
this
consideration
,
indeed
,
however
lightly
it
be
pass
over
in
our
conception
,
doth
,
in
a
great
measure
,
level
all
fortune
and
condition
,
and
give
no
man
a
right
to
triumph
in
the
happy
state
,
or
any
reason
to
repine
in
the
most
miserable
.
<EOS>
Would
the
most
worldly
man
see
this
in
the
light
in
which
they
examine
all
other
matter
,
they
would
soon
feel
and
acknowledge
the
force
of
this
way
of
reasoning
;
for
which
of
them
would
give
any
price
for
an
estate
from
which
they
be
liable
to
be
immediately
eject
?
<EOS>
or
,
would
they
not
laugh
at
him
as
a
madman
who
account
himself
rich
from
such
an
uncertain
possession
?
<EOS>
this
be
the
fountain
,
sir
,
from
which
I
have
draw
my
philosophy
.
<EOS>
hence
it
be
that
I
have
learn
to
look
on
all
those
thing
which
be
esteem
the
blessing
of
life
,
and
those
which
be
dread
as
its
evil
,
with
such
a
degree
of
indifference
that
,
as
I
should
not
be
elate
with
possess
the
former
,
so
neither
be
I
greatly
dejected
and
depress
by
suffer
the
latter
.
<EOS>
be
the
actor
esteem
happier
to
whose
lot
it
fall
to
play
the
principal
part
than
he
who
play
the
low
?
<EOS>
and
yet
the
drama
may
run
twenty
night
together
,
and
by
consequence
may
outlast
our
life
;
but
,
at
the
good
,
life
be
only
a
little
long
drama
,
and
the
business
of
the
great
stage
be
consequently
a
little
more
serious
than
that
which
be
perform
at
the
Theatre
-
royal
.
<EOS>
but
even
here
,
the
catastrophe
and
calamity
which
be
represent
be
capable
of
affect
us
.
<EOS>
the
wise
man
can
deceive
themselves
into
feel
the
distress
of
a
tragedy
,
though
they
know
them
to
be
merely
imaginary
;
and
the
child
will
often
lament
them
as
reality
:
<EOS>
what
wonder
then
,
if
these
tragical
scene
which
I
allow
to
be
a
little
more
serious
,
should
a
little
more
affect
us
?
<EOS>
where
then
be
the
remedy
but
in
the
philosophy
I
have
mention
,
which
,
when
once
by
a
long
course
of
meditation
it
be
reduce
to
a
habit
,
teach
us
to
set
a
just
value
on
everything
,
and
cure
at
once
all
eager
wish
and
abject
fear
,
all
violent
joy
and
grief
concerning
object
which
can
not
endure
long
,
and
may
not
exist
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
expr
yourself
extremely
well
,
"
cry
Booth
;
"
and
I
entirely
agree
with
the
justice
of
your
sentiment
;
but
,
however
true
all
this
may
be
in
theory
<EOS>
,
I
still
doubt
its
efficacy
in
practice
.
<EOS>
and
the
cause
of
the
difference
between
these
two
be
this
;
that
we
reason
from
our
head
,
but
act
from
our
heart
:
    
Video
meliora
,
proboque
;
         
Deteriora
sequor
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
can
differ
more
widely
than
wise
man
and
fool
in
their
estimation
of
thing
;
but
,
as
both
act
from
their
uppermost
passion
,
they
both
often
act
like
.
<EOS>
what
comfort
then
can
your
philosophy
give
to
an
avaricious
man
who
be
deprive
of
his
rich
or
to
an
ambitious
man
who
be
stript
of
his
power
?
<EOS>
to
the
fond
lover
who
be
tear
from
his
mistress
or
to
the
tender
husband
who
be
drag
from
his
wife
?
<EOS>
do
you
really
think
that
any
meditation
on
the
shortness
of
life
will
soothe
them
in
their
affliction
?
<EOS>
be
not
this
very
shortness
itself
one
of
their
affliction
?
<EOS>
and
if
the
evil
they
suffer
be
a
temporary
deprivation
of
what
they
love
,
will
they
not
think
their
fate
the
hard
,
and
lament
the
more
,
that
they
be
to
lose
any
part
of
an
enjoyment
to
which
there
be
so
short
and
so
uncertain
a
period
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
leave
,
sir
,
"
say
the
gentleman
,
"
to
distinguish
here
.
<EOS>
by
philosophy
,
I
do
not
mean
the
bare
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
,
but
an
energy
,
a
habit
,
as
Aristotle
call
it
;
and
this
I
do
firmly
believe
,
with
him
and
with
the
Stoics
,
be
superior
to
all
the
attack
of
fortune
.

when
the

in

in
a
surly
tone
bad
them
both

ask
the
philosopher

go
to
Newgate

for
that
he
must
carry
him
thither

afternoon

the
poor

very
much
shocked

I

I
do

I

I
would
have
you
consider
that
the
twenty

four

almost
out

so
it

fellow

lay
violent
hand
on

assailant
so
violent
a
salute

be
unwilling

be
idle
,

entirely
to
owe
his
rescue
from
both
the
ruffian

the
serjeant

he
therefore
imitate
the
example
which
his
friend
have
set
him

with
a
lusty
blow
level
the
other
follower

roar
out

<EOS>
the

swear
heartily
he
would
carry
him
to
Newgate

<EOS>
"
You

cry
the
serjeant

with
the
high
indignation

<EOS>
"
offer

to
lay
your

I
will
knock
your

down

then
,
turn
to
Booth

he
cry
,
"
They

"
  
<EOS>
and
now
three
gentleman
enter
the
room
;
these
be
an
attorney

the
person
whom
the
serjeant
have
procure
in
the
morning
to
be
his
bail
with
Colonel
James
,
and
lastly
Doctor
Harrison
himself
.
  
<EOS>
the
bailiff
no
sooner
see
the
attorney
,
with
whom
he
be
well
acquaint
(
for
the
other
he
know
not
)
,
than
he
begin
,
as
the
phrase
be
,
to
pull
in
his
horn
,
and
order
the
two
follower
,
who
be
now
get
again
on
their
leg
,
to
walk
down
-
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
,
captain
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
when
last
we
part
,
I
believe
we
neither
of
us
expect
to
meet
in
such
a
place
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
doctor

"
cry
Booth
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
to
have
be
send
hither
by
the
gentleman

do
me
that
favour

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
so
,
sir

"
say
the
doctor
;
"
you
be
send
hither
by
some
person
,
I
suppose
,
to
whom
you
be
indebte

<EOS>
this
be
the
usual
place
,
I
apprehend
,
for
creditor
to
send
their
debtor
to
.
<EOS>
but
you
ought
to
be
more
surprize
that
the
gentleman
who
send
you
hither
be
come
to
release
you
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Murphy
,
you
will
perform
all
the
necessary
ceremonial

"
  
<EOS>
the
attorney
then
ask
the
bailiff
with
how
many
action
Booth
be
charge
,
and
be
inform
there
be
five
besides
the
doctor

which
be
much
the
heavy
of
all

<EOS>
proper
bond

presently

and
the
doctor
and
the
serjeant

friend
sign
them
;
the
bailiff
,
at
the
instance

the
attorney
,
make
no
objection

the
bail

<EOS>
[

Lawyer

<EOS>
Booth
,
we
may
be
assure
,
make
a
handsome
speech
to
the
doctor
for
such
extraordinary
friendship
,
with
which
,
however
,
we
do
not
think
proper
to
trouble
the
reader
;
and
now
everything
be
end
,
and
the
company
ready
to
depart
,
the
bailiff
step
up
to
Booth
,
and
tell
him
he
hope
he
would
remember
civility

money
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
"
cry
Booth
,
"
you
mean
incivility
-
money
;
if
there
be
any
fee
due
for
rudeness
,
I
must
own
<EOS>
you
have
a
very
just
claim
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
be
sure
,
sir
,
"
cry
the
bailiff
,
"
I
have
treat
your
honour
with
all
the
respect
in
the
world
;
no
man

I
be
sure
,
can
charge
me
with
use
a
gentleman
rudely
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
belong
to
a
gentleman
better
;
but
you
can
not
deny
that
two
of
my
man
have
be
knock
down
;
and
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
,
as
you
be
a
gentleman
,
you
will
give
them
something
to
drink
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
about
to
answer
with
some
passion
,
when
the
attorney
interfere
,
and
whisper
in
his
ear
that
it
be
usual
to
make
a
compliment
to
the
officer
,
and
that
he
have
well
comply
with
the
custom
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
the

have
treat
me
civilly

"
answer
Booth
,
"
I
should
have
have
no
objection
to
comply
with
a
bad
custom
in
his
favour
;
but
I
be
resolve
I
will
never
reward
a
man
for
use
me
ill
;
and
I
will
not
agree
to
give
him
a
single
farthing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
very
well
,
sir
,
"
say
the
bailiff
;
"
I
be
rightly
serve
for
my
good
-
nature
;
but
,
if
it
have
be
to
do
again
,
I
would
have
take
care
<EOS>
you
should
not
have
be
bail
this
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Harrison
,
to
whom
Booth
refer
the
cause
,
after
give
him
a
succinct
account
of
what
have
pass
,
declare
the
captain
to
be
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
a
most
horrid
imposition
that
such
fellow
be
ever
suffer
to
prey
on
the
necessitous
;
but
that
the
example
would
be
much
bad
to
reward
them
where
they
have
behave
themselves
ill
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
bailiff
be
worthy
of
great
rebuke
for
what
he
hath
just
now
say
;
in
which
I
hope
he
hath
boast
of
more
power
than
be
in
him
.
<EOS>
We
do
,
indeed
,
with
great
justice
and
propriety
value
ourselves
on
our
freedom
if
the
liberty
of
the
subject
depend
on
the
pleasure
of
such
fellow
as
these
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
so
neither
altogether
,
"
cry
the
lawyer
;
"
but
custom
hath
establish
a
present
or
fee
to
them
at
the
delivery
of
a
prisoner
,
which
they
call
civility
-
money
,
and
expect
as
in
a
manner
their
due
,
though
in
reality
they
have
no
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
will
any
man
,
"
cry
Doctor
Harrison
,
"
after
what
the
captain
hath
tell
us
,
say
that
the
bailiff
hath
behave
himself
as
he
ought
;
and
,
if
he
have
,
be
he
to
be
reward
for
not
act
in
an
unchristian
and
inhuman
manner
?
<EOS>
it
be
pity
that
,
instead
of
a
custom
of
fee
them
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
poor
and
wretched
,
when
they
do
not
behave
themselves
ill
,
there
be
not
both
a
law
and
a
practice
to
punish
them
severely
when
they
do
.
<EOS>
in
the
present
case
,
I
be
so
far
from
agree
to
give
the
bailiff
a
shilling
,
that
,
if
there
be
any
method
of
punish
him
for
his
rudeness
,
I
shall
be
heartily
glad
to
see
it
put
in
execution
;
for
there
be
none
whose
conduct
should
be
so
strictly
watch
as
that
of
these
necessary
evil
in
the
society
,
as
their
office
concern
for
the
most
part
those
poor
creature
who
can
not
do
themselves
justice
,
and
as
they
be
generally
the
bad
of
man
who
undertake
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bailiff
then
quit
the
room
,
mutter
that
he
should
know
better
what
to
do
another
time
;
and
shortly
after
,
Booth
and
his
friend
leave
the
house
;
but
,
as
they
be
go
out
,
the
author
take
Doctor
Harrison
aside
,
and
slipt
a
receipt
into
his
hand
,
which
the
doctor
return
,
say
,
he
never
subscribe
when
he
neither
know
the
work
nor
the
author
;
but
that
,
if
he
would
call
at
his
lodging
,
he
would
be
very
willing
to
give
all
the
encouragement
to
merit
which
be
in
his
power
.
  
<EOS>
the
author
take
down
the
doctor
's
name
and
direction
,
and
make
him
as
many
bow
as
he
would
have
do
have
he
carry
off
the
half
-
guinea
for
which
he
have
be
fish

<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
then
take
his

BOOK
IX

<EOS>
in
which
the
history
look
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
proceed
farther
with
our
history
it
may
be
proper
to
look
back
a
little
,
in
order
to
account
for
the
late
conduct
of
Doctor
Harrison
;
which
,
however
inconsistent
it
may
have
hitherto
appear
,
when
examine
to
the
bottom
will
be
find
,
I
apprehend
,
to
be
truly
congruous
with
all
the
rule
of
the
most
perfect
prudence
as
well
as
with
the
most
consummate
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
already
partly
see
in
what
light
Booth
have
be
represent
to
the
doctor
abroad
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
account
which
be
send
of
the
captain
,
as
well
by
the
curate
as
by
a
gentleman
of
the
neighbourhood
,
be
much
gross
and
more
to
his
disadvantage
than
the
doctor
be
pleased
to
set
them
forth
in
his
letter
to
the
person
accuse
.
<EOS>
what
sense
he
have
of
Booth
's
conduct
be
,
however
,
manifest
by
that
letter
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
resolve
to
suspend
his
final
judgment
till
his
return
;
and
,
though
he
censure
him
,
would
not
absolutely
condemn
him
without
ocular
demonstration
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
on
his
return
to
his
parish
,
find
all
the
accusation
which
have
be
transmit
to
him
confirm
by
many
witness
,
of
which
the
curate
's
wife
,
who
have
be
formerly
a
friend
to
Amelia
,
and
still
preserve
the
outward
appearance
of
friendship
,
be
the
strong
.
<EOS>
She
introduce
all
with
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
say
it
;
and
it
be
friendship
which
bid
me
speak
;
and
it
be
for
their
good
it
should
be
tell
you
.
"
<EOS>
after
which
beginning
she
never
conclude
a
single
speech
without
some
horrid
slander
and
bitter
invective
.
  
<EOS>
besides
the
malicious
turn
which
be
give
to
these
affair
in
the
country
,
which
be
owe
a
good
deal
to
misfortune
,
and
some
little
perhaps
to
imprudence
,
the
whole
neighbourhood
ring
with
several
gross
and
scandalous
lie
,
which
be
merely
the
invention
of
his
enemy
,
and
of
which
the
scene
be
lay
in
London
since
his
absence
.
  
<EOS>
poison
with
all
this
malice
,
the
doctor
come
to
town
;
and
,
learn
where
Booth
lodge
,
go
to
make
him
a
visit
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
the
doctor
,
and
no
other
,
who
have
be
at
his
lodging
that
evening
when
Booth
and
Amelia
be
walk
in
the
Park
,
and
concern
which
the
reader
may
be
pleased
to
remember
so
many
strange
and
odd
conjecture
.
  
<EOS>
here
the
doctor
see
the
little
gold
watch
and
all
those
fine
trinket
with
which
the
noble
lord
have
present
the
child
,
and
which
,
from
the
answer
give
him
by
the
poor
ignorant
,
innocent
girl
,
he
could
have
no
doubt
have
be
purchase
within
a
few
day
by
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
this
account
tally
so
well
with
the
idea
he
have
imbibe
of
Booth
's
extravagance
in
the
country
,
that
he
firmly
believe
both
the
husband
and
wife
to
be
the
vain
,
silly
,
and
most
unjust
people
alive
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
almost
incredible
that
two
rational
being
should
be
guilty
of
such
absurdity
;
but
,
monstrous
and
absurd
as
it
be
,
ocular
demonstration
appear
to
be
the
evidence
against
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
depart
from
their
lodging
enrage
at
this
suppose
discovery
,
and
,
unhappily
for
Booth
,
be
engage
to
supper
that
very
evening
with
the
country
gentleman
of
whom
Booth
have
rent
a
farm
.
<EOS>
as
the
poor
captain
happen
to
be
the
subject
of
conversation
,
and
occasion
their
compare
note
,
the
account
which
the
doctor
give
of
what
he
have
see
that
evening
so
incense
the
gentleman
,
to
whom
Booth
be
likewise
a
debtor
,
that
he
vow
he
would
take
a
writ
out
against
him
the
next
morning
,
and
have
his
body
alive
or
dead
;
and
the
doctor
be
at
last
persuade
to
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Murphy
be
thereupon
immediately
send
for
;
and
the
doctor
in
his
presence
repeat
again
what
he
have
see
at
his
lodging
as
the
foundation
of
his
sue
him
,
which
the
attorney
,
as
we
have
before
see
,
have
blab
to
Atkinson
.
  
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
do
the
doctor
hear
that
Booth
be
arrest
than
the
wretched
condition
of
his
wife
and
family
<EOS>
begin
to
affect
his
mind
.
<EOS>
the
child
,
who
be
to
be
utterly
undone
with
their
father
,
be
intirely
innocent
;
and
as
for
Amelia
herself
,
though
he
think
he
have
most
convincing
proof
of
very
blameable
levity
,
yet
his
former
friendship
and
affection
to
her
be
busy
to
invent
every
excuse
,
till
,
by
very
heavily
load
the
husband
,
they
lighten
the
suspicion
against
the
wife
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
temper
of
mind
he
resolve
to
pay
Amelia
a
second
visit
,
and
be
on
his
way
to
Mrs.
Ellison
when
the
serjeant
meet
him
and
make
himself
known
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
take
his
old
servant
into
a
coffee
-
house
,
where
he
receive
from
him
such
an
account
of
Booth
and
his
family
,
that
he
desire
the
serjeant
to
shew
him
presently
to
Amelia
;
and
this
be
the
cordial
which
we
mention
at
the
end
of
the
ninth
chapter
of
the
precede
book
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
become
soon
satisfied
concern
the
trinket
which
have
give
him
so
much
uneasiness
,
and
which
have
bring
so
much
mischief
on
the
head
of
poor
Booth
.
<EOS>
Amelia
likewise
give
the
doctor
some
satisfaction
as
to
what
he
have
hear
of
her
husband
's
behaviour
in
the
country
;
and
assure
him
,
upon
her
honour
,
that
Booth
could
so
well
answer
every
complaint
against
his
conduct
,
that
she
have
no
doubt
but
that
a
man
of
the
doctor
's
justice
and
candour
would
entirely
acquit
him
,
and
would
consider
him
as
an
innocent
unfortunate
man
,
who
be
the
object
of
a
good
man
's
compassion
,
not
of
his
anger
or
resentment
.
  
<EOS>
this
worthy
clergyman
,
who
be
not
desirous
of
find
proof
to
condemn
the
captain
or
to
justify
his
own
vindictive
proceeding
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
rejoice
heartily
in
every
piece
of
evidence
which
tend
to
clear
up
the
character
of
his
friend
,
give
a
ready
ear
to
all
which
Amelia
say
.
<EOS>
to
this
,
indeed
,
he
be
induce
by
the
love
he
always
have
for
that
lady
,
by
the
good
opinion
he
entertain
of
her
,
as
well
as
by
pity
for
her
present
condition
,
than
which
nothing
appear
more
miserable
;
for
he
find
her
in
the
high
agony
of
grief
and
despair
,
with
her
two
little
child
cry
over
their
wretched
mother
.
<EOS>
these
be
,
indeed
,
to
a
well
-
dispose
mind
,
the
most
tragical
sight
that
human
nature
can
furnish
,
and
afford
a
juster
motive
to
grief
and
tear
in
the
beholder
than
it
would
be
to
see
all
the
hero
who
have
ever
infest
the
earth
hang
all
together
in
a
string
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
feel
this
sight
as
he
ought
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
endeavour
to
comfort
the
afflict
;
in
which
he
so
well
succeed
,
that
he
restore
to
Amelia
sufficient
spirit
to
give
him
the
satisfaction
we
have
mention
:
after
which
he
declare
he
would
go
and
release
her
husband
,
which
he
accordingly
do
in
the
manner
we
have
above
relate
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
history
go
forward
.
 
<EOS>
We
now
return
to
that
period
of
our
history
to
which
we
have
bring
it
at
the
end
of
our
last
book
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
and
his
friend
arrive
from
the
bailiff
's
,
at
the
serjeant
's
lodging
,
where
Booth
immediately
run
up
-
stair
to
his
Amelia
;
between
whom
I
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
nothing
certainly
be
ever
more
tender
or
more
joyful
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
I
will
observe
,
that
a
very
few
of
these
exquisite
moment
,
of
which
the
good
mind
only
be
capable
,
do
in
reality
over
-
balance
the
long
enjoyment
which
can
ever
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
bad
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
Booth
and
his
wife
be
feast
their
soul
with
the
most
delicious
mutual
endearment
,
the
doctor
be
fall
to
play
with
the
two
little
child
below
-
stair
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
thus
engage
the
little
boy
do
somewhat
amiss
;
upon
which
the
doctor
say
,
"
if
you
do
so
any
more
I
will
take
your
papa
away
from
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
again
!
<EOS>
sir
,
"
say
the
child
;
"
why
,
be
it
you
then
that
take
away
my
papa
before
?
"
<EOS>
"
suppose
it
be
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
would
not
you
forgive
me
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
cry
the
child
,
"
I
would
forgive
you
;
because
a
Christian
must
forgive
everybody
;
but
I
should
hate
you
as
long
as
I
live
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
so
pleased
with
the
boy
's
answer
,
that
he
catch
him
in
his
arm
and
kiss
him
;
at
which
time
Booth
and
his
wife
return
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
ask
which
of
them
be
their
son
's
instructor
in
his
religion
;
Booth
answer
that
he
must
confess
Amelia
have
all
the
merit
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
rather
think
he
have
learn
of
his
father
,
"
cry
the
doctor
;
"
for
he
seem
a
good
soldier
-
like
Christian
,
and
profess
to
hate
his
enemy
with
a
very
good
grace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
,
Billy
!
<EOS>
"
cry
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
do
not
teach
you
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
I
would
hate
my
enemy
,
madam
,
"
<EOS>
cry
the
boy
<EOS>
;
"
I
only
say
I
would
hate
papa
's
enemy
.
<EOS>
sure
,
mamma
,
there
be
no
harm
in
that
;
nay
,
I
be
sure
there
be
no
harm
in
it
,
for
I
have
hear
you
say
the
same
thing
a
thousand
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
smile
on
the
child
,
and
,
chuck
him
under
the
chin
,
tell
him
he
must
hate
nobody
5
and
now
<EOS>
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
who
have
provide
a
dinner
for
them
all
,
desire
them
to
walk
up
and
partake
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
it
be
that
Booth
be
first
make
acquaint
with
the
serjeant
's
marriage
,
as
be
Dr
Harrison
;
<EOS>
both
of
whom
greatly
felicitate
him
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
who
be
,
perhaps
,
a
little
more
confounded
than
she
would
have
be
have
<EOS>
she
marry
a
colonel
,
say
,
"
if
I
have
do
wrong
,
Mrs.
Booth
be
to
answer
for
it
,
for
she
make
the
match
;
indeed
,
Mr.
Atkinson
,
you
be
greatly
oblige
to
the
character
which
this
lady
give
of
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
will
deserve
it
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
<EOS>
and
,
if
the
army
hath
not
corrupt
a
good
boy
,
I
believe
I
may
answer
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
while
our
little
company
be
enjoy
that
happiness
which
never
fail
to
attend
conversation
where
all
present
be
pleased
with
each
other
,
a
visitant
arrive
who
be
,
perhaps
,
not
very
welcome
to
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
Colonel
James
,
who
,
enter
the
room
with
much
gaiety
,
go
directly
up
to
Booth
,
embrace
him
,
and
express
great
satisfaction
at
find
him
there
;
he
then
make
an
apology
for
not
attend
him
in
the
morning
,
which
he
say
have
be
impossible
;
and
that
he
have
,
with
the
utmost
difficulty
,
put
off
some
business
of
great
consequence
in
order
to
serve
him
this
afternoon
;
"
but
I
be
glad
on
your
account
,
"
cry
he
to
Booth
,
"
that
my
presence
be
not
necessary
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
himself
be
extremely
satisfied
with
this
declaration
,
and
fail
not
to
return
him
as
many
thank
as
he
would
have
deserve
<EOS>
have
he
perform
his
promise
;
but
the
two
lady
be
not
quite
so
well
satisfied
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
serjeant
,
he
have
slipt
out
of
the
room
when
the
colonel
enter
,
not
entirely
out
of
that
bashfulness
which
we
have
remark
him
to
be
taint
with
,
but
indeed
,
from
what
have
past
in
the
morning
,
he
hate
the
sight
of
the
colonel
as
well
on
the
account
of
his
wife
as
on
that
of
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
on
the
contrary
,
on
what
he
have
formerly
hear
from
both
Amelia
and
her
husband
of
the
colonel
's
generosity
and
friendship
,
have
build
so
good
an
opinion
of
him
,
that
he
be
very
much
pleased
with
see
him
,
and
take
the
first
opportunity
of
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
"
Colonel
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
I
have
not
the
happiness
of
be
know
to
you
;
but
I
have
long
be
desirous
of
an
acquaintance
with
a
gentleman
in
whose
commendation
I
have
hear
so
much
from
some
present
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
colonel
make
a
proper
answer
to
this
compliment
,
and
they
soon
enter
into
a
familiar
conversation
together
;
for
the
doctor
be
not
difficult
of
access
;
indeed
,
he
hold
the
strange
reserve
which
be
usually
practise
in
this
nation
between
people
who
be
in
any
degree
stranger
to
each
other
to
be
very
unbecoming
the
christian
character
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
lady
soon
leave
the
room
;
and
the
remainder
of
the
visit
,
which
be
not
very
long
,
past
in
discourse
on
various
common
subject
,
not
worth
record
.
<EOS>
in
the
conclusion
,
the
colonel
invite
Booth
and
his
lady
,
and
the
doctor
,
to
dine
with
him
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
to
give
Colonel
James
his
due
commendation
,
he
have
shew
a
great
command
of
himself
and
great
presence
of
mind
on
this
occasion
;
for
,
to
speak
the
plain
truth
,
the
visit
be
intend
to
Amelia
alone
;
nor
do
he
expect
,
or
perhaps
desire
,
anything
less
than
to
find
the
captain
at
home
.
<EOS>
the
great
joy
which
he
suddenly
convey
into
his
countenance
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
his
friend
be
to
be
attribute
to
that
noble
art
which
be
teach
in
those
excellent
school
call
the
several
court
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
by
this
,
man
be
enable
to
dress
out
their
countenance
as
much
at
their
own
pleasure
as
they
do
their
body
,
and
to
put
on
friendship
with
as
much
ease
as
they
can
a
laced
coat
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
colonel
and
doctor
be
go
,
Booth
acquaint
Amelia
with
the
invitation
he
have
receive
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
strike
with
the
news
,
and
betray
such
visible
mark
of
confusion
and
uneasiness
,
that
they
could
not
have
escape
Booth
's
observation
have
suspicion
give
him
the
least
hint
to
remark
;
but
this
,
indeed
,
be
the
great
optic
-
glass
help
us
to
discern
plainly
almost
all
that
pass
in
the
mind
of
other
,
without
some
use
of
which
nothing
be
more
purblind
than
human
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
have
recover
from
her
first
perturbation
,
answer
,
"
My
dear
,
I
will
dine
with
you
wherever
you
please
to
lay
your
command
on
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
oblige
to
you
,
my
dear
soul
,
"
cry
Booth
;
"
your
obedience
shall
be
very
easy

for
my
command
will
be
that
you
shall
always
follow
your
own

My
inclination

answer
she
,
"
would

I
be
afraid

too
unreasonable

confinement

be
with
you

your
child

with
at
most
a
single
friend
or
two
now
and
then

"
<EOS>
"
o
my

"
reply
he
,
"
large
company
give
us
a
great
relish

our

Mrs.

little
interruption

I
must
undergo
the
penance

I
be
sure
I

why

answer
he

to
the
company
of
Mrs.
James
;

I
must
confess
she
hath
not
behave
to
you
lately
as
you
may
have
expect
;
but
you
ought
to
pass
all
that
by
for
the
sake
of
her
husband
,
to
whom
we
have
both
so
many
obligation
,
who
be
the
worthy
,
honest
,
and
most
generous
fellow
in
the
universe
,
and
the
good
friend
to
me
that
ever
man
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
who
have
far
other
suspicion
,
and
begin
to
fear
that
her
husband
have
discover
them
,
be
highly
pleased
when
she
see
him
take
a
wrong
scent
.
<EOS>
She
give
,
therefore
,
a
little
in
to
the
deceit
,
and
acknowledge
the
truth
of
what
he
have
mention
;
but
say
that
the
pleasure
she
should
have
in
comply
with
his
desire
would
highly
recompense
any
dissatisfaction
which
may
arise
on
any
other
account
;
and
shortly
after
end
the
conversation
on
this
subject
with
her
chearfully
promising
to
fulfil
his
promise
.
  
<EOS>
in
reality
,
poor
Amelia
have
now
a
most
unpleasant
task
to
undertake
;
for
she
think
it
absolutely
necessary
to
conceal
from
her
husband
the
opinion
she
have
conceive
of
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
for
,
as
she
know
the
character
,
as
well
of
her
husband
as
of
his
friend
,
or
rather
enemy
(
both
be
often
synonymous
in
the
language
of
the
world
)
,
she
have
the
utmost
reason
to
apprehend
something
very
fatal
may
attend
her
husband
's
entertain
the
same
thought
of
James
which
fill
and
torment
her
own
breast
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
as
she
know
that
nothing
but
these
thought
could
justify
the
least
unkind
,
or
,
indeed
,
the
least
reserved
behaviour
to
James
,
who
have
,
in
all
appearance
,
confer
the
great
obligation
upon
Booth
and
herself
,
she
be
reduce
to
a
dilemma
the
most
dreadful
that
can
attend
a
virtuous
woman
,
as
it
often
give
the
high
triumph
,
and
sometimes
no
little
advantage
,
to
the
man
of
professed
gallantry
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
to
avoid
give
any
umbrage
to
her
husband
,
Amelia
be
force
to
act
in
a
manner
which
she
be
conscious
must
give
encouragement
to
the
colonel
;
a
situation
which
perhaps
require
as
great
prudence
and
delicacy
as
any
in
which
the
heroic
part
of
the
female
character
can
be
exert
.
    
<EOS>
a
conversation
between
Dr
Harrison
and
other
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
day
Booth
and
his
lady
,
with
the
doctor
,
meet
at
Colonel
James
's
,
where
Colonel
Bath
likewise
make
one
of
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
very
remarkable
pass
at
dinner
,
or
till
the
lady
withdraw
.
<EOS>
during
this
time
,
however
,
the
behaviour
of
Colonel
James
be
such
as
give
some
uneasiness
to
Amelia
,
who
well
understand
his
meaning
,
though
the
particular
be
too
refined
and
subtle
to
be
observe
by
any
other
present
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
lady
be
go
,
which
be
as
soon
as
Amelia
could
prevail
on
Mrs.
James
to
depart
,
Colonel
Bath
,
who
have
be
pretty
brisk
with
champagne
at
dinner
,
soon
begin
to
display
his
magnanimity
.
<EOS>
"
My
brother
tell
me
,
young
gentleman

"
say
he
to
Booth
,
"
that
you
have
be
use
very
ill
lately
by
some
rascal
,

I
have
no
doubt

you
will
do
yourself
justice
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
answer
that
he
do
not
know
what
he
mean
.
<EOS>
"
since
I
must
mention
it
then
,
"
cry
the
colonel
,
"
I
hear
you
have
be
arrest
;
and
I
think
you
know
what
satisfaction
be
to
be
require
by
a
man
of
honour
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
,

the
doctor
,
"
no
more
may
be
mention

<EOS>
I
be
convince
no
satisfaction
will
be
require
of
the
captain
till
he
be
able
to
give
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
able

cry
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
to
which
the
doctor
answer
,
"
that
it
be
of
too
tender
a
nature
to
speak
more
of
.
"
  
"
give
me
your
hand
,
doctor
,
"
cry
the
colonel
;
"
I
see
you
be
a
man
of
honour

though
you
wear
a
gown

<EOS>
It
be
,
as
you
say
,
a
matter
of
a
tender
nature
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
indeed
,
be
so
tender
as
a
man
's
honour

<EOS>
curse
my
liver

if
any
man
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
that
is

if
any
gentleman
,
be
to
arrest
me
,
I
would
as
surely
cut
his
throat
as
"
  
"
how
,
sir
!

say
the
doctor
,
"
would
you
compensate
one
breach
of
the
law
by
a
much
great
,
and
pay
your
debt
by
commit
murder
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
mention
law
between
gentleman
?

say
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
"
a
man
of
honour
wear
his
law
by
his
side
;
and
can
the
resentment
of
an
affront
make
a
gentleman
guilty
of
murder
?
<EOS>
and
what
great
affront
can
one
man
cast
upon
another
than
by
arrest
him
?
<EOS>
I
be
convinced
that
he
who
would
put
up
an
arrest
would
put
up
a
slap
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
the
colonel
look
extremely
fierce
,
and
the
divine
stare
with
astonishment
at
this
doctrine
;
when
Booth
,
who
well
know
the
impossibility
of
oppose
the
colonel
's
humour
with
success
,
begin
to
play
with
it
;
and
,
have
first
convey
a
private
wink
to
the
doctor
,
he
say
there
may
be
case
undoubtedly
where
such
an
affront
ought
to
be
resent
;
but
that
there
be
other
where
any
resentment
be
impracticable
:
"
<EOS>
as
,
for
instance
,
"
say
he
,
"
where
the
man
be
arrest
by
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
be
suppose
to
mean
that
case
,
"
cry
the
colonel
;
"
and
you
be
convinced
I
do
not
mean
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
put
an
end
to
this
discourse
at
once
,
sir

the

"
I
be
the
plaintiff

be
you
so

the

then
I
have
no
more
to

they

no

you

I
be
apt

believe
both
Mr.

Dryden

though
I
can
not

<EOS>
in

it
be

it
be

Booth
begin
to
be

may
grow
too
warm

in

case
he
fear
that
the

honour

together

may
hurry
him
so
far
as
to
forget
the
respect
due

which
he
profess
to
pay

to
the
sacerdotal
robe

<EOS>
Booth
therefore
interpose
between
the
disputant
,
and
say
that
the
colonel
have
very
rightly
propose
to
call
a
new
subject
;
for
that
it
be
impossible
to
reconcile
accept
a
challenge
with
the
christian
religion
,
or
refuse
it
with
the
modern
notion
of
honour

"
<EOS>
and
you
must
allow
it
,
doctor

"
say
he
,
"
to
be
a
very
hard
injunction
for
a
man
to
become
infamous
;

more
especially
for
a
soldier

who
be
to
lose
his
bread
into
the
bargain

<EOS>
"
ay

"
  
<EOS>
"
why

I

on

may
be

me

in
truth
,
his
thought
have
be
otherwise
employ
;
nor
be
it
very
difficult
for
the
reader
to
guess
what
have
be
the
subject
of
them
.
<EOS>
be
wake
,
however
,
from
his
reverie
,
and
have
hear
the
two
or
three
last
speech

he
turn
to
his
brother
,
and
ask
him
,
why
he
would
introduce
such
a
topic
of
conversation
before
a
gentleman
of
Doctor
Harrison
's
character
?
  
<EOS>
"
brother
,
"
cry
Bath
,
"
I
own
it
be
wrong
,
and
I
ask
the
doctor
's
pardon
:
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
it
happen
to
arise
;
for
you
know
,
brother
,
I
be
not
use
to
talk
of
these
matter
.
<EOS>
They
be
generally
poltroon
that
do
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
need
not
be
behold
to
my
tongue
to
declare
I
be
none
.
<EOS>
I
have
show
myself
in
a
line
of
battle
.
<EOS>
I
believe
there
be
no
man
will
deny
that
;
I
believe
I
may
say
no
man
dare
deny
that
I
have
do
my
duty
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
be
thus
proceed
to
prove
that
his
prowess
be
neither
the
subject
of
his
discourse
nor
the
object
of
his
vanity
,
when
a
servant
enter
and
summon
the
company
to
tea
with
the
lady
;
a
summon
which
Colonel
James
instantly
obey
,
and
be
follow
by
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
the
tea
-
table
conversation
,
though
extremely
delightful
to
those
who
be
engage
in
it
,
may
probably
appear
somewhat
dull
to
the
reader
,
we
will
here
put
an
end
to
the
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
a
dialogue
between
Booth
and
Amelia
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
morning
early
,
Booth
go
by
appointment
and
wait
on
Colonel
James
;
whence
he
return
to
Amelia
in
that
kind
of
disposition
which
the
great
master
of
human
passion
would
describe
in
Andromache
,
when
he
tell
us
she
cry
and
smile
at
the
same
instant
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
plainly
perceive
the
discomposure
of
his
mind
,
in
which
the
opposite
affection
of
joy
and
grief
be
struggle
for
the
superiority
,
and
beg
to
know
the
occasion
;
upon
which
Booth
speak
as
follow
:
    
"
My
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
no
intention
to
conceal
from
you
what
hath
past
this
morning
between
me
and
the
colonel
,
who
hath
oppress
me
,
if
I
may
use
that
expression
,
with
obligation
.
<EOS>
sure
never
man
have
such
a
friend
;
for
never
be
there
so
noble
,
so
generous
a
heart
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
this
ebullition
of
gratitude
,
I
really
can
not
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
he
pause
a
moment
,
and
wipe
his
eye
,
and
then
proceed
:
"
You
know
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
how
gloomy
the
prospect
be
yesterday
before
our
eye
,
how
inevitable
ruin
stare
me
in
the
face
;
and
the
dreadful
idea
of
have
entail
beggary
on
my
Amelia
and
her
posterity
rack
my
mind
;
for
though
,
by
the
goodness
of
the
doctor
,
I
have
regain
my
liberty
,
the
debt
yet
remain
;
and
,
if
that
worthy
man
have
a
design
of
forgive
me
his
share
,
this
must
have
be
my
utmost
hope
,
and
the
condition
in
which
I
must
still
have
find
myself
need
not
to
be
expatiate
on
.
<EOS>
in
what
light
,
then
,
shall
I
see
,
in
what
word
shall
I
relate
,
the
colonel
's
kindness
?
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
my
dear
Amelia
!
<EOS>
he
hath
remove
the
whole
gloom
at
once
,
hath
drive
all
despair
out
of
my
mind
,
and
hath
fill
it
with
the
most
sanguine
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
most
reasonable
hope
of
make
a
comfortable
provision
for
yourself
and
my
dear
child
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
then
,
he
will
advance
me
a
sum
of
money
to
pay
off
all
my
debt
;
and
this
on
a
bond
to
be
repay
only
when
I
shall
become
colonel
of
a
regiment
,
and
not
before
.
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
he
be
go
this
very
morning
to
ask
a
company
for
me
,
which
be
now
vacant
in
the
West
Indies
;
and
,
as
he
intend
to
push
this
with
all
his
interest
,
neither
he
nor
I
have
any
doubt
of
his
success
.
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
,
come
the
third
,
which
,
though
perhaps
it
ought
to
give
me
the
great
joy
,
<EOS>
such
be
,
I
own
,
<EOS>
the
weakness
of
my
nature
<EOS>
,
it
rend
my
very
heartstring
asunder
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
mention
it
,
for
I
know
it
will
give
you
equal
pain
;
though
I
know
,
on
all
proper
occasion
,
you
can
exert
a
manly
resolution
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
,
I
be
convinced
,
oppose
it
,
whatever
you
must
suffer
in
comply
.
<EOS>
o
my
dear
Amelia
!
<EOS>
I
must
suffer
likewise
;
yet
I
have
resolve
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
You
know
not
what
my
poor
heart
hath
suffer
since
he
make
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
It
be
love
for
you
alone
which
could
persuade
me
to
submit
to
it
.
<EOS>
consider
our
situation
;
consider
that
of
our
child
;
reflect
but
on
those
poor
babe
,
whose
future
happiness
be
at
stake
,
and
it
must
arm
your
resolution
.
<EOS>
It
be
your
interest
and
theirs
that
reconcile
me
to
a
proposal
which
,
when
the
colonel
first
make
it
,
strike
me
with
the
utmost
horror
;
he
hath
,
indeed
,
from
these
motive
,
persuade
me
into
a
resolution
which
I
think
impossible
for
any
one
to
have
persuade
me
into
.
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
my
dear
Amelia
!
<EOS>
let
me
entreat
you
to
give
me
up
to
the
good
of
your
child
,
as
I
have
promise
the
colonel
to
give
you
up
to
their
interest
and
your
own
.
<EOS>
if
you
refuse
these
term
we
be
still
undone
,
for
he
insist
absolutely
upon
them
.
<EOS>
think
,
then
,
my
love
,
however
hard
they
may
be
,
necessity
compel
us
to
submit
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
know
in
what
light
a
woman
,
who
love
like
you
,
must
consider
such
a
proposal
;
<EOS>
and
yet
how
many
instance
have
you
of
woman
who
,
from
the
same
motive
,
have
submit
to
the
same
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
you
mean
,
Mr.
Booth
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Amelia
,
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
"
need
I
explain
my
meaning
to
you
more
?
"
answer
Booth
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
I
not
say
I
must
give
up
my
Amelia
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
give
me
up
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
a
time
only
,
I
mean
,
"
answer
he
:
"
for
a
short
time
perhaps
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
himself
will
take
care
<EOS>
it
shall
not
be
long
 
for
I
know
his
heart
;
I
shall
scarce
have
more
joy
in
receive
you
back
than
he
will
have
in
restore
you
to
my
arm
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
he
will
not
only
be
a
father
to
my
child
,
but
a
husband
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
husband
to
me
!
"
say
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
;
a
kind
,
a
fond
,
a
tender
,
an
affectionate
husband
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
not
the
most
certain
assurance
of
this
,
doth
<EOS>
my
Amelia
think
I
could
be
prevail
on
to
leave
her
?
<EOS>
no
,
my
Amelia
,
he
be
the
only
man
on
earth
who
could
have
prevail
on
me
;
but
I
know
his
house
,
his
purse
,
his
protection
,
will
be
all
at
your
command
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
any
dislike
you
have
conceive
to
his
wife
,
let
not
that
be
any
objection
;
for
I
be
convinced
he
will
not
suffer
her
to
insult
you
;
besides
,
she
be
extremely
well
breed
,
and
,
how
much
soever
she
may
hate
you
in
her
heart
,
she
will
at
least
treat
you
with
civility
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
the
invitation
be
not
his
,
but
her
;
and
I
be
convinced
they
will
both
behave
to
you
with
the
great
friendship
;
his
I
be
sure
will
be
sincere
,
as
to
the
wife
of
a
friend
entrust
to
his
care
;
and
hers
will
,
from
good
-
breeding
,
have
not
only
the
appearance
but
the
effect
of
the
true
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
my
dear
,
at
last
,
"
say
she
(
indeed
she
have
ramble
into
very
strange
conceit
from
some
part
of
his
discourse
)
;
"
and
I
will
give
you
my
resolution
in
a
word
 
I
will
do
the
duty
of
a
wife
,
and
that
be
,
to
attend
her
husband
wherever
he
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
attempt
to
reason
with
her
,
but
all
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
give
,
indeed
,
a
quiet
hearing
to
all
he
say
,
and
even
to
those
part
which
most
displease
her
ear
;
I
mean
those
in
which
he
exaggerate
the
great
goodness
and
disintereste
generosity
of
his
friend
;
but
her
resolution
remain
inflexible
,
and
resist
the
force
of
all
his
argument
with
a
steadiness
of
opposition
,
which
it
would
have
be
almost
excusable
in
him
to
have
construe
into
stubbornness
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
arrive
in
the
midst
of
the
dispute
;
and
,
have
hear
the
merit
of
the
cause
on
both
side
,
deliver
his
opinion
in
the
follow
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
think
it
,
my
dear
child
,
a
matter
of
the
utmost
nicety
to
interfere
in
any
difference
between
husband
and
wife
;
but
,
since
you
both
desire
me
with
such
earnestness
to
give
you
my
sentiment
on
the
present
contest
between
you
,
I
will
give
you
my
thought
as
well
as
I
be
able
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
then
,
can
anything
be
more
reasonable
than
for
a
wife
to
desire
to
attend
her
husband
?
<EOS>
It
be
,
as
my
favourite
child
observe
,
no
more
than
a
desire
to
do
her
duty
;
and
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
that
be
one
great
reason
of
her
insist
on
it
.
<EOS>
and
how
can
you
yourself
oppose
it
?
<EOS>
Can
love
be
its
own
enemy
?
<EOS>
or
can
a
husband
who
be
fond
of
his
wife
,
content
himself
almost
on
any
account
with
a
long
absence
from
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
like
an
angel
,
my
dear
Doctor
Harrison
,
"
answer
Amelia
:
"
I
be
sure
,
if
he
love
as
tenderly
as
I
do
,
he
could
on
no
account
submit
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
,
child
,
"
cry
the
doctor
;
"
there
be
some
reason
which
would
not
only
justify
his
leave
you
,
but
which
must
force
him
,
if
he
hath
any
real
love
for
you
,
join
with
common
sense
,
to
make
that
election
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
necessary
,
for
instance
,
either
to
your
good
or
to
the
good
of
your
child
,
he
would
not
deserve
the
name
of
a
man
,
I
be
sure
not
that
of
a
husband
,
if
he
hesitate
a
moment
.
<EOS>
nay
,
in
that
case
,
I
be
convince
you
yourself
would
be
an
advocate
for
what
you
now
oppose
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
therefore
I
mistake
him
when
I
apprehend
<EOS>
he
say
that
the
colonel
make
his
leave
you
behind
as
the
condition
of
get
him
the
commission
;
for
I
know
my
dear
child
hath
too
much
goodness
,
and
too
much
sense
,
and
too
much
resolution
,
to
prefer
any
temporary
indulgence
of
her
own
passion
to
the
solid
advantage
of
her
whole
family
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
my
dear
!

<EOS>
cry
Booth
<EOS>
;
"
I
know
what
opinion
the
doctor
would
be
of

<EOS>
nay

I
be
certain
there

that
I

the
world
understand

my
comfort

<EOS>
"
I
should
greatly
esteem

<EOS>

why

whenever
you
act
like
a
wise
woman

"
cry
the
doctor
,

you

force
me
to

you
so
:

,
whenever
you

act

I

whether
I

"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
dear
doctor
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
I
be
convince
my
Amelia
will
never
do
anything
to
forfeit
your
good
opinion

<EOS>
consider
but
the
cruel
hardship
of
what
she
be
to
undergo
,
and
you
will
make
allowance
for
the
difficulty
she
make
in
comply

<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
when
I
examine
my
own
heart

I
have
more
obligation
to
her
than
appear
at
first
sight
;
for
,
by
oblige
me
to
find
argument
to
persuade
her
,
she
hath
assist
me

conquer
myself

indeed
,
if
she
have
shew
more
resolution
,
I
should
have
shew
less

"
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
think
it
necessary
,
then
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
that
there
should
be
one
fool
at
least
in
every
married
couple
.
<EOS>
a
mighty
resolution
,
truly
!
<EOS>
and
well
worth
your
valuing
yourself
upon
,
to
part
with
your
wife
for
a
few
month
in
order
to
make
the
fortune
of
her
and
your
child
;
when
you
be
to
leave
her
,
too
,
in
the
care
and
protection
of
a
friend
that
give
credit
to
the
old
story
of
friendship
,
and
doth
an
honour
to
human
nature
.
<EOS>
what
,
in
the
name
of
goodness
!
<EOS>
do
either
of
you
think
that
you
have
make
an
union
to
endure
for
ever
?
<EOS>
how
will
either
of
you
bear
that
separation
which
must
,
some
time
or
other
,
and
perhaps
very
soon
,
be
the
lot
of
one
of
you
?
<EOS>
have
you
forget
that
you
be
both
mortal
?
<EOS>
as
for
Christianity
,
I
see
you
have
resign
all
pretension
to
it
;
for
I
make
no
doubt
but
that
you
have
so
set
your
heart
on
the
happiness
you
enjoy
here
together
,
that
neither
of
you
ever
think
a
word
of
hereafter

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
now
burst
into
tear
;
upon
which
Booth
beg
the
doctor
to
proceed
no
farther
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
would
not
have
want
the
caution
;
for
,
however
blunt
he
appear
in
his
discourse
,
he
have
a
tenderness
of
heart
which
be
rarely
find
among
man
;
for
which
I
know
no
other
reason
than
that
true
goodness
be
rarely
find
among
them
;
for
I
be
firmly
persuade
that
the
latter
never
possess
any
human
mind
in
any
degree
,
without
be
attend
by
as
large
a
portion
of
the
former
.
  
<EOS>
thus
end
the
conversation
on
this
subject
;
what
follow
be
not
worth
relate
,
till
the
doctor
carry
off
Booth
with
him
to
take
a
walk
in
the
Park
.
    
<EOS>
a
conversation
between
Amelia
and
Dr
Harrison
,
with
the
result
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
,
be
leave
alone
,
begin
to
consider
seriously
of
her
condition
;
she
see
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
resist
the
importunity
of
her
husband
,
back
by
the
authority
of
the
doctor
,
especially
as
she
well
know
how
unreasonable
her
declaration
must
appear
to
every
one
who
be
ignorant
of
her
real
motive
to
persevere
in
it
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
she
be
fully
determine
,
whatever
may
be
the
consequence
,
to
adhere
firmly
to
her
resolution
of
not
accept
the
colonel
's
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
have
turn
the
matter
every
way
in
her
mind
,
and
vex
and
torment
herself
with
much
uneasy
reflexion
upon
it
,
a
thought
at
last
occur
to
her
which
immediately
bring
her
some
comfort
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
to
make
a
confidant
of
the
doctor
,
and
to
impart
to
him
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
this
method
,
indeed
,
appear
to
her
now
to
be
so
adviseable
,
that
she
wonder
she
have
not
hit
upon
it
sooner
;
but
it
be
the
nature
of
despair
to
blind
us
to
all
the
mean
of
safety
,
however
easy
and
apparent
they
may
be
.
  
<EOS>
have
fix
her
purpose
in
her
mind
,
she
write
a
short
note
to
the
doctor
,
in
which
she
acquaint
him
that
she
have
something
of
great
moment
to
impart
to
him
,
which
must
be
an
entire
secret
from
her
husband
,
and
beg
that
she
may
have
an
opportunity
of
communicate
it
as
soon
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Harrison
receive
the
letter
that
afternoon
,
and
immediately
comply
with
Amelia
's
request
in
visit
her
.
<EOS>
He
find
her
drink
tea
with
her
husband
and
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
and
sit
down
and
join
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
the
removal
of
the
tea
-
table
Mrs.
Atkinson
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
then
,
turn
to
Booth
,
say
,
"
I
hope
,
captain
,
you
have
a
true
sense
of
the
obedience
due
to
the
church
,
though
our
clergy
do
not
often
exact
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
proper
to
exercise
our
power
sometimes
,
in
order
to
remind
the
laity
of
their
duty
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
,
therefore
,
that
I
have
some
private
business
with
your
wife
;
and
I
expect
your
immediate
absence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
doctor
,
"
answer
Booth
,
"
no
popish
confessor
,
I
firmly
believe
,
ever
pronounce
his
will
and
pleasure
with
more
gravity
and
dignity
;
none
therefore
be
ever
more
immediately
obey
than
you
shall
be
.
"
<EOS>
Booth
then
quit
the
room
,
and
desire
the
doctor
to
recall
him
when
his
business
with
the
lady
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Harrison
promise
he
would
;
and
then
turn
to
Amelia
he
say
,
"
thus
far
,
madam
,
I
have
obey
your
command
,
and
be
now
ready
to
receive
the
important
secret
which
you
mention
in
your
note
.
<EOS>
"
Amelia
now
inform
her
friend
of
all
she
know
,
all
she
have
see
and
hear
,
and
all
that
she
suspect
,
of
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
the
good
man
seem
greatly
shock
at
the
relation
,
and
remain
in
a
silent
astonishment
.
<EOS>
upon
which
Amelia
say
,
"
be
villany
so
rare
a
thing
,
sir
,
that
it
should
so
much
surprize
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
child
,
"
cry
he
;
"
but
I
be
shocked
at
see
it
so
artfully
disguise
under
the
appearance
of
so
much
virtue
;
and
,
to
confess
the
truth
<EOS>
,
I
believe
my
own
vanity
be
a
little
hurt
in
have
be
so
grossly
impose
upon
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
a
very
high
regard
for
this
man
;
for
,
besides
the
great
character
give
him
by
your
husband
,
and
<EOS>
the
many
fact
I
have
hear
so
much
redound
to
his
honour
,
he
hath
the
fair
and
most
promising
appearance
I
have
ever
yet
behold
.
<EOS>
a
good
face
,
they
say
,
be
a
letter
of
recommendation
.
<EOS>
o
nature
,
Nature
,
why
art
thou
so
dishonest
as
ever
to
send
man
with
these
false
recommendation
into
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
my
dear
sir
,
I
begin
to
grow
entirely
sick
of
it
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
for
sure
all
mankind
almost
be
villain
in
their
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
fie
,
child
!
"
cry
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
make
a
conclusion
so
much
to
the
dishonour
of
the
great
Creator
.
<EOS>
the
nature
of
man
be
far
from
be
in
itself
evil
:
it
abound
with
benevolence
,
charity
,
and
pity
,
covet
praise
and
honour
,
and
shun
shame
and
disgrace
.
<EOS>
bad
education
,
bad
habit
,
and
bad
custom
,
debauch
our
nature
,
and
drive
it
headlong
as
it
be
into
vice
.
<EOS>
the
governor
of
the
world
,
and
I
be
afraid
the
priesthood
,
be
answerable
for
the
badness
of
it
.
<EOS>
instead
of
discourage
wickedness
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
,
both
be
too
apt
to
connive
at
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
great
sin
of
adultery
,
for
instance
;
hath
the
government
provide
any
law
to
punish
it
?
<EOS>
or
doth
the
priest
take
any
care
to
correct
it
?
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
be
the
most
notorious
practice
of
it
any
detriment
to
a
man
's
fortune
or
to
his
reputation
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
doth
<EOS>
it
exclude
him
from
any
preferment
in
the
state
,
I
have
almost
say
in
the
church
?
<EOS>
be
it
any
blot
in
his
escutcheon
?
<EOS>
any
bar
to
his
honour
?
<EOS>
be
he
not
to
be
find
every
day
in
the
assembly
of
woman
of
the
high
quality
?
<EOS>
in
the
closet
of
the
great
man
,
and
even
at
the
table
of
bishop
?
<EOS>
what
wonder
then
if
the
community
in
general
treat
this
monstrous
crime
as
a
matter
of
jest
,
and
that
man
give
way
to
the
temptation
of
a
violent
appetite
,
when
the
indulgence
of
it
be
protect
by
law
and
countenance
by
custom
?
<EOS>
I
be
convinced
there
be
good
stamina
in
the
nature
of
this
very
man
;
for
he
hath
do
act
of
friendship
and
generosity
to
your
husband
before
he
could
have
any
evil
design
on
your
chastity
;
and
in
a
christian
society
,
which
I
no
more
esteem
this
nation
to
be
than
I
do
any
part
of
Turkey
,
I
doubt
not

this
very
colonel
would
have
make
a
worthy
and
valuable
member

I

if
you
shew

I

that
I
may

certain

not

I
will
stay
away

<EOS>
You
do
not
think

I
hope

that
I
will
join
in
a
chearful
conversation
with
such
a

that
I
will
so
far
betray
my
character
as
to
give
any
countenance

such
flagitious
proceeding

<EOS>
besides
,
my
promise
be
only
conditional
;
and
I
do
not
know
whether
I
could
otherwise
have
keep
it

for
I
expect
an
old
friend
every

who
come
to
town
twenty
mile
on
foot
to
see
me
,
whom
I
shall
not
part
with
on

as

he
may

answer

that
I

honestly

<EOS>

perhaps
I

blame
the
goodness

reply
Amelia

that
be
perhaps
an
honester
confession

you

do

pray

sir

be
serious

give
me
your
advice
what
to
do

consider
the
difficult
game
I
have
to
play
;
for
I
be
sure
,
after
what
I
have
tell

you
would
not

<EOS>

no

have
a
house

how
to
dissuade
my

continue
she

without
give
him
any
suspicion

real
cause

the
consequence

his
guessing

I

upon

<EOS>

I
will
consult
my

upon
it

in
the
morning
you
shall
see
me
again

be
comfort

I

Your
innocence
may
give
you
a

confident
trust

more
powerful
assistance

however

I
will
do
all
I
can
to
serve

now
,
if
you
please

we
will
call
back

return
into

do
the
serjeant

Mrs.
Atkinson

the
two
couple

with
the
doctor
,
spend
the
evening
together
in
great
mirth
and
festivity
;
for

one
of

good

vein
of
chearfulness

good
humour

run
through

impossible
to

contain
as
surprize
an
accident

acquaint

the
great
goodness
of
Colonel
James

with
the
chearful
prospect

he
entertain
from
it
.
<EOS>
this
Atkinson

behind
the
curtain
,
communicate
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
the
conclusion
which
she
draw
from
it
need
scarce
be
hint
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
She
make
,
indeed
,
no
scruple
of
plainly
and
bluntly
tell
her
husband
that
the
colonel
have
a
most
manifest
intention
to
attack
the
chastity
of
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
this
thought
give
the
poor
serjeant
great
uneasiness
,
and
,
after
have
keep
him
long
awake
,
torment
him
in
his
sleep
with
a
most
horrid
dream
,
in
which
he
imagine
that
he
see
the
colonel
stand
by
the
bedside
of
Amelia
,
with
a
naked
sword
in
his
hand
,
and
threaten
to
stab
her
instantly
unless
she
comply
with
his
desire
.
<EOS>
upon
this
the
serjeant
start
up
in
his
bed
,
and
,
catch
his
wife
by
the
throat
,
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
D####n
you
,
put
up
your
sword
this
instant
,
and
leave
the
room
,
or
by
Heaven
I
will
drive
mine
to
your
heart
's
blood
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
rough
treatment
immediately
rouse
Mrs.
Atkinson
from
her
sleep
,
who
no
sooner
perceive
the
position
of
her
husband
,
and
feel
his
hand
grasp
her
throat
,
than
she
give
a
violent
shriek
and
presently
fall
into
a
fit
.
  
<EOS>
Atkinson
now
wake
likewise
,
and
soon
become
sensible
of
the
violent
agitation
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
leapt
out
of
bed
,
and
run
for
a
bottle
of
water
,
begin
to
sprinkle
her
very
plentifully
;
but
all
to
no
purpose
:
she
neither
speak
nor
give
any
symptom
of
recovery
Atkinson
then
begin
to
roar
aloud
;
upon
which
Booth
,
who
lie
under
him
,
jump
from
his
bed
,
and
run
up
with
the
light
candle
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
the
serjeant
have
no
sooner
take
the
candle
than
he
run
with
it
to
the
bed
-
side
.
<EOS>
here
he
behold
a
sight
which
almost
deprive
him
of
his
sense
.
<EOS>
the
bed
appear
to
be
all
over
blood
,
and
his
wife
welter
in
the
midst
of
it
.
<EOS>
upon
this
the
serjeant
,
almost
in
a
frenzy
,
cry
out
,
"
o
Heavens
!
<EOS>
I
have
kill
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
have
stab
her
!
<EOS>
I
have
stab
her
!
"
<EOS>
"
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
all
this
?

say
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
o
,
sir
!
"
cry
the
serjeant
,
"
<EOS>
I
dreamt
I
be
rescue
your
lady
from
the
hand
of
Colonel
James
,
and
I
have
kill
my
poor
wife
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
he
throw
himself
upon
the
bed
by
her
,
catch
her
in
his
arm
,
and
behave
like
one
frantic
with
despair
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
Amelia
have
throw
on
a
wrapping
-
gown
,
and
be
come
up
into
the
room
,
where
the
serjeant
and
his
wife
be
lie
on
the
bed
and
Booth
stand
like
a
motionless
statue
by
the
bed
-
side
.
<EOS>
Amelia
have
some
difficulty
to
conquer
the
effect
of
her
own
surprize
on
this
occasion
;
for
a
more
ghastly
and
horrible
sight
than
the
bed
present
could
not
be
conceive
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
send
Booth
to
call
up
the
maid
of
the
house
,
in
order
to
lend
her
assistance
;
but
before
his
return
Mrs.
Atkinson
begin
to
come
to
herself
;
and
soon
after
,
to
the
inexpressible
joy
of
the
serjeant
,
it
be
discover
she
have
no
wound
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
delicate
nose
of
Amelia
soon
make
that
discovery
,
which
the
gross
smell
of
the
serjeant
,
and
perhaps
his
fright
,
have
prevent
him
from
make
;
for
now
it
appear
that
the
red
liquor
with
which
the
bed
be
stain
,
though
it
may
,
perhaps
,
sometimes
run
through
the
vein
of
a
fine
lady
,
be
not
what
be
properly
call
blood
,
but
be
,
indeed
,
no
other
than
cherry
-
brandy
,
a
bottle
of
which
Mrs.
Atkinson
always
keep
in
her
room
to
be
ready
for
immediate
use
,
and
to
which
she
use
to
apply
for
comfort
in
all
her
affliction

<EOS>
this
the
poor
serjeant
,
in
his
extreme
hurry
,
have
mistake
for
a
bottle
of
water
.
<EOS>
matter
be
now
soon
accommodate
,
and
no
other
mischief
appear
to
be
do
,
unless
to
the
bed

cloath

<EOS>
Amelia
and
Booth
return
back
to
their
room
,
and
Mrs.
Atkinson
rise
from
her
bed
in
order
to
equip
it
with
a
pair
of
clean
sheet
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
this
adventure
would
have
end
without
produce
any
kind
of
consequence
,
have
not
the
word
which
the
serjeant
utter
in
his
frenzy
make
some
slight
impression
on
Booth
;
<EOS>
so
much
,
at
least
,
as
to
awaken
his
curiosity
;
so
that
in
the
morning
when
he
arise
he
send
for
the
serjeant
,
and
desire
to
hear
the
particular
of
this
dream
,
since
Amelia
be
concern
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
serjeant
at
first
seem
unwilling
to
comply
,
and
endeavour
to
make
excuse
.
<EOS>
this
,
perhaps
,
encrease
Booth
's
curiosity
,
and
he
say
,
"
nay
,
I
be
resolve
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
why
,
you
simpleton
,
do
you
imagine
me
weak
enough
to
be
affect
by
a
dream
,
however
terrible
it
may
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sir

"
cry
the
serjeant
,
"
as
for
that
matter
,
dream
have
sometimes
fall
out
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
one
of
my
own
,
I
know
,
do
so
,
concern
your
honour
;
for
,
when
you
court
my
young
lady
,
I
dreamt
you
be
married
to
her
;
and
yet
it
be
at
a
time
when
neither
I
myself
,
nor
any
of
the
country
,
think
you
would
ever
obtain
her
.
<EOS>
but
Heaven
forbid
this
dream
<EOS>
should
ever
come
to
pass
!
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
be
this
dream
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Booth

<EOS>
"
I
insist
on
know

"
to
be
sure
,
sir

the
serjeant

"
I
must
not
refuse
you
;
but
I
hope
you
will
never
think
any
more
of
it
.
<EOS>
why
then
,
sir
,
I
dreamt
that
your
honour
be
go
to
the
West
Indies
,
and
have
leave
my
lady
in
the
care
of
Colonel
James
;
and
last
night
I
dreamt
the
colonel
come
to
my
lady
's
bed
-
side
,
offer
to
ravish
her
,
and
with
a
draw
sword
in
his
hand
,
threaten
to
stab
her
that
moment
unless
she
would
comply
with
his
desire
.
<EOS>
how
I
come
to
be
by
I
know
not
;
<EOS>
but
I
dreamt
<EOS>
I
rush
upon
him
,
catch
him
by
the
throat
,
and
swear
I
would
put
him
to
death
unless
he
instantly
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
here
I
wake
,
and
this
be
my
dream
.
<EOS>
I
never
pay
any
regard
to
a
dream
in
my
life
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
I
never
dreamt
anything
so
very
plain
as
this
.
<EOS>
It
appear
downright
reality
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
leave
the
mark
of
my
finger
in
my
wife
's
throat
.
<EOS>
I
would
riot
have
take
a
hundred
pound
to
have
use
her
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
faith
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
it
be
an
odd
dream
,
and
not
so
easily
to
be
account
for
as
that
you
have
formerly
of
my
marriage
;
for
,
as
Shakespear
say
,
dream
denote
a
foregone
conclusion

now
it
be
impossible
you
should
ever

my

to

if
you
must
go
from

certainly
there
be
other

what

the

of

be
extremely
quick

she
now
perceive
what
have
happen
,

how
much
her

know

She
resolve
therefore
to
humour
him

fall
severely
on
Colonel
James
for
what
he
have
say
to
the
serjeant

Booth
endeavour
all
he
could

end
this

bring

give

after
a
slight
preface

address
herself
to

to
throw
away
all

<EOS>
Booth
make
a
very
low
bow

modestly
speak
in
disparagement
of
himself

<EOS>
to
which
she
answer
,
"
indeed
,
Mr.

you
have
merit

I
have
hear
it

bow
again

be
offer
to
speak

she
interrupt
him
,
say
,
"

Amelia

who
have
long
since
forget
the
dislike
she
have
take
to
Mrs.
James
at
her
first
see
her
in
town

have
attribute
it
to
the
right

have
begin
to
resume
her
former
friendship
for
her

express
very
warm
sentiment
of
gratitude
on

occasion

<EOS>
She
tell
Mrs.

she
should
be
eternally
oblige

her

could
succeed
in

for

the

give

the

"
indeed

add
she
,
"
I
can
not
help
say
he
hath
some
merit

two
dreadful
wound

one
of

very
greatly
endanger

He

indeed

Amelia
,
"
you
injure

I
envy
no

happiness
in
marriage

"
at
these
word
such
look
past
between
Booth
and
his
wife
as
,
to
a
sensible
by
-
stander
,
would
have
make
all
the
air
of
Mrs.
James
appear
in
the
high
degree
contemptible
,
and
would
have
render
herself
the
object
of
compassion
.
<EOS>
nor
could
that
lady
avoid
look
a
little
silly
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
now
,
at
the
earnest
desire
of
her
husband
,
accoutre
herself
to
attend
her
friend
;
but
first
she
insist
on
visit
her
child
,
to
whom
she
give
several
hearty
kiss
,
and
then
,
recommend
them
to
the
care
of
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
she
and
her
husband
accompany
Mrs.
James
to
the
rout
;
where
few
of
my
fine
reader
will
be
displeased
to
make
part
of
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
lady
and
Booth
then
enter
an
apartment
beset
with
card
-
table
,
like
the
room
at
Bath
and
Tunbridge
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
James
immediately
introduce
her
friend
to
Lady
Betty
,
who
receive
them
very
civily
,
and
presently
engage
Booth
and
Mrs.
James
in
a
party
at
whist
;
for
,
as
to
Amelia
,
she
so
much
decline
playing
,
that
as
the
party
could
be
fill
without
her
,
she
be
permit
to
sit
by
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
who
should
make
his
appearance
but
the
noble
peer
of
whom
so
much
honourable
mention
hath
already
be
make
in
this
history
?
<EOS>
He
walk
directly
up
to
Amelia
,
and
address
her
with
as
perfect
a
confidence
as
if
he
have
not
be
in
the
least
conscious
of
have
in
any
manner
displease
her
;
though
the
reader
will
hardly
suppose
that
Mrs.
Ellison
have
keep
anything
a
secret
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
be
not
,
however
,
so
forgetful
.
<EOS>
She
make
him
a
very
distant
courtesy
,
would
scarce
vouchsafe
an
answer
to
anything
he
say
,
and
take
the
first
opportunity
of
shift
her
chair
and
retire
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
Her
behaviour
,
indeed
,
be
such
that
the
peer
plainly
perceive
that
he
should
get
no
advantage
by
pursue
her
any
farther
at
present
.
<EOS>
instead
,
therefore
,
of
attempt
to
follow
her
,
he
turn
on
his
heel
and
address
his
discourse
to
another
lady
,
though
he
could
not
avoid
often
cast
his
eye
towards
Amelia
as
long
as
she
remain
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Fortune
,
which
seem
to
have
be
generally
no
great
friend
to
Mr.
Booth
,
give
him
no
extraordinary
mark
of
her
favour
at
play
.
<EOS>
He
lose
two
full
rubber
,
which
cost
him
five
guinea
;
after
which
,
Amelia
,
who
be
uneasy
at
his
lordship
's
presence
,
beg
him
in
a
whisper
to
return
home
;
with
which
request
he
directly
comply
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
,
I
think
,
remarkable
happen
to
Booth
,
unless
the
renewal
of
his
acquaintance
with
an
officer
whom
he
have
know
abroad
,
and
who
make
one
of
his
party
at
the
whist
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
the
name
of
this
gentleman
,
with
whom
the
reader
will
hereafter
be
better
acquaint
,
be
trent
.
<EOS>
He
have
formerly
be
in
the
same
regiment
with
Booth
,
and
there
be
some
intimacy
between
them
.
<EOS>
Captain
Trent
exprest
great
delight
in
meet
his
brother
officer
,
and
both
mutually
promise
to
visit
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
the
scene
which
have
past
the
precede
night
and
that
morning
have
so
confused
Amelia
's
thought
,
that
,
in
the
hurry
in
which
she
be
carry
off
by
Mrs.
James
,
she
have
entirely
forget
her
appointment
with
Dr
Harrison
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
inform
at
her
return
home
that
the
doctor
have
be
to
wait
upon
her
,
and
have
express
some
anger
at
her
be
go
out
<EOS>
,
she
become
greatly
uneasy
,
and
beg
of
her
husband
to
go
to
the
doctor
's
lodging
and
make
her
apology
.
  
<EOS>
but
lest
the
reader
should
be
as
angry
with
the
doctor
as
he
have
declare
himself
with
Amelia
<EOS>
,
we
think
proper
to
explain
the
matter
.
<EOS>
nothing
then
be
farth
from
the
doctor
's
mind
than
the
conception
of
any
anger
towards
Amelia
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
when
the
girl
answer
him
that
her
mistress
be
not
at
home
,
the
doctor
say
with
great
good
humour
,
"
how
!
not
at
home
!
<EOS>
then
tell
your
mistress
she
be
a
giddy
vagabond
,
and
I
will
come
to
see
her
no
more
till
she
send
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
the
poor
girl
,
from
misunderstand
one
word
,
and
half
forget
the
rest
,
have
construe
into
great
passion
,
several
very
bad
word
,
and
a
declaration
that
he
would
never
see
Amelia
any
more
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
two
stranger
make
their
appearance
.

Booth
go
to
the

after
what

we
need
take
little
notice
of
the
apology

by

the

reception

<EOS>
Your

be
a
vain
hussy
to
think
herself
worth
my
anger

but
tell
her
I
have
the
vanity
myself
to
think
I
can
not
be
angry
without
a
well
cause

<EOS>
and
yet
tell
her
I
intend
to
punish
her
for
her
levity

for
,
if
you

abroad

I
have
determine
to
take
her
down
with
me
into
the

make
her
do
penance
there
till
you
return

I
assure

you

however

I

Booth

"
if
I
should
be
so
unhappy
to

her

she
must
herself
determine

and
,
I
believe
,
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
guess
where
her
choice
will
fall
;
for
of
all

the

to
the

my

what

yours

<EOS>
I
never
so

what
then
,
"
cry
the
doctor
;
"
do
you
ever
hear
that
a

be
marry
?
<EOS>
and
yet
some
of
them
have
have
son

daughter

I
believe
;
but
,
however
,
this
young

will
absolve
me
without
oblige
me
to
penance

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
yet
that
power

the

<EOS>
"
be
you
not

"
<EOS>
cry
the
doctor
;
"
why
then
I
will
absolve
myself

<EOS>
You
be
to
know
then
,
my
good
friend
,
that
this
young
lady
be
the
daughter
of
a
neighbour
of
mine
,
who
be
since
dead
,
and
whose
sin
I
hope
be
forgive
;
for
she
have
too
much
to
answer
for
on
her
child
's
account

<EOS>
Her
father
be
my
intimate
acquaintance

friend

a
worthy
man
,
indeed
,
I
believe
never
live
.
<EOS>
He
die
suddenly
when
his
child
be
infant
;
and
,
perhaps
,
to
the
suddenness
of
his
death
it
be
owe
that
he
do
not
recommend
any
care
of
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
,
in
some
measure
,
take
that
charge
upon
me
;
and
particularly
of
her
whom
I
call
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
as
she
grow
up
she
discover
so
many
good
quality
that
she
want
not
the
remembrance
of
her
father
's
merit
to
recommend
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
her
no
more
than
justice
when
I
say
she
be
one
of
the
good
creature
I
ever
know

<EOS>
She
hath
a
sweetness
of
temper

a
generosity
of
spirit

an
openness
of
heart
 
in
a
word
,
she
hath
a
true

disposition

<EOS>
I
may
call
her
an
Israelite
indeed
,
in
whom
there
be
no
guile

<EOS>
"
I
wish
you

you
may

the
observation

Mr.

that
he
find
not

remember
the

Mr.

end

the

fifth

seem

as

become
a

not

transcribe
it
from

you

I
shall
not

my

I
know
,
again
,
what
Mr.

,
in
his

,
say
on
that
verse
of
St

<EOS>
that
it
be

how
these
word
be
generally
understand

<EOS>
the
commentator
you
mention

I
think

tell
us
that
love
be
not
here
to
be
take
in
the
strict
sense

so
as
to
signify
the
complacency
of
the
heart

you
may
hate
your
enemy
as
God
's
enemy
,

seek
due
revenge
of
them
for
his
honour
;
and
,
for
your
own
sake
too
,
you
may
seek
moderate
satisfaction
of
them
;
but
then
you
be
to
love
them
with
a
love
consistent
with
these
thing
;
that
be
to
say
,
in
plainer
word
,
you
be
to
love
them

hate
them

bless

curse
,
and
do
them
good
and
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
excellent

I

my

very
seriously

<EOS>
the
two
verse
take
together
,
contain
a
very
positive
precept
,
deliver
in
the
plain
word
,
and
yet
illustrate
by
the
clear
instance
in
the
conduct
of
the
Supreme
Being
;
and
lastly
,
the
practice
of
this
precept
be
most
nobly
enforce
by
the
reward
annex
 
that
ye
may
be
the
child
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
no
man
who
understand
what
it
be
to
love
,
and
to
bless
,
and
to
do
good

can
mistake
the
meaning

<EOS>
but
if
they
require
any
comment
,
the
scripture
itself
afford
enow
.
<EOS>
if
thine
enemy
hunger

feed
him
;
if
he
thirst
,
give
him
drink

not

evil

indeed

want

comment

man
,
who
,
when
they
can
not
bend
their
mind
to
the
obedience
of
scripture
,
be
desirous
to
wr
scripture
to
a
compliance
with
their
own
inclination

<EOS>
"
  
"
most
nobly

justly
observe
,
"
cry
the
old
gentleman

"
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
good
friend

you
have
explain
the
text
with
the
utmost
perspicuity

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
this
be
the
meaning

"
cry
the
son
,
"
there
must
be
an
end
of
all
law
and
justice

I
do

how

his

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
,
sir

the

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
as
an
enemy
merely
,
and
from
a
spirit
of
revenge
,
he
can
not
,
and
he
ought
not
to
prosecute
him
;
but
as
an
offender
against
the
law
of
his
country
he
may
,
and
it
be
his
duty
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
be
there
any
spirit
of
revenge
in
the
magistrate
or
officer
of
justice
when
they
punish
criminal
?
<EOS>
why
do
such
,
ordinarily
I
mean
,
concern
themselves
in
inflicting
punishment
,
but
because
it
be
their
duty
?
<EOS>
and
why
may
not
a
private
man
deliver
an
offender
into
the
hand
of
justice
,
from
the
same
laudable
motive
?
<EOS>
revenge
,
indeed
,
of
all
kind
be
strictly
prohibit
;
wherefore
,
as
we
be
not
to
execute
it
with
our
own
hand
,
so
neither
be
we
to
make
use
of
the
law
as
the
instrument
of
private
malice
,
and
to
worry
each
other
with
inveteracy
and
rancour
.
<EOS>
and
where
be
the
great
difficulty
in
obey
this
wise
,
this
generous
,
this
noble
precept
?
<EOS>
if
revenge
be
,
as
a
certain
divine
,
not
greatly
to
his
honour
,
call
it
,
the
most
luscious
morsel
the
devil
ever
dropt
into
the
mouth
of
a
sinner
,
it
must
be
allow
at
least
to
cost
us
often
extremely
dear
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dainty
,
if
indeed
it
be
one
,
which
we
come
at
with
great
inquietude
,
with
great
difficulty
,
and
with
great
danger
.
<EOS>
however
pleasant
it
may
be
to
the
palate
while
we
be
feed
on
it
,
it
be
sure
to
leave
a
bitter
relish
behind
it
;
and
so
far
,
indeed
,
it
may
be
call
a
luscious
morsel
,
that
the
most
greedy
appetite
be
soon
glut
,
and
the
most
eager
longing
for
it
be
soon
turn
into
loathing
and
repentance
.
<EOS>
I
allow
there
be
something
tempting
in
its
outward
appearance
,
but
it
be
like
the
beautiful
colour
of
some
poison
,
from
which
,
however
they
may
attract
our
eye
,
a
regard
to
our
own
welfare
command
us
to
abstain
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
an
abstinence
to
which
wisdom
alone
,
without
any
Divine
command
,
hath
be
often
find
adequate
,
with
instance
of
which
the
greek
and
latin
author
everywhere
abound
.
<EOS>
May
not
a
Christian
,
therefore
,
be
well
ashamed
of
make
a
stumbling
-
block
of
a
precept
,
which
be
not
only
consistent
with
his
worldly
interest
,
but
to
which
so
noble
an
incentive
be
propose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
fall
into
rapture
at
this
speech
,
and
,
after
make
many
compliment
to
the
doctor
upon
it
,
he
turn
to
his

tell

any

and
Amelia
ask
what
entertainment
he
could
carry
them
to
at
that
time
of
day
?
  
<EOS>
"
suppose

I
should
carry
you
to

at
five
o'clock
in

cry
Booth

<EOS>
"
ay

<EOS>
what

can
there
be
to
a
rational

equal
to
this

<EOS>
be
not
the
taste
of
mankind
most
wretchedly
deprave

where
would
the
vain
man
find
an
honour

where
would
the
love
of
pleasure
propose
so
adequate
an
object
as
divine
worship

<EOS>
with
what
ecstasy
must
the
contemplation
of
be
admit

the

<EOS>
the
pitiful
court
of
prince

open

to
those

at
particular
season

from
this
glorious

<EOS>
the

thus
when

the
whole
company
with
the
great
alacrity
attend
the

to
St

<EOS>
when
the

<EOS>
the
extreme
beauty
and
elegance
of
this
place
be
well
known
to
almost
every
one
of
my
reader
;
and
happy
be
it
for
me
that
it
be
so
,
since
to
give
an
adequate
idea
of
it
would
exceed
my
power
of
description
.
<EOS>
to
delineate
the
particular
beauty
of
these
garden
would
,
indeed
,
require
as
much
pain
,
and
as
much
paper
too
,
as
to
rehearse
all
the
good
action
of
their
master
,
whose
life
prove
the
truth
of
an
observation
which
I
have
read
in
some
ethic
writer
,
that
a
truly
elegant
taste
be
generally
accompany
with
an
excellency
of
heart
;
or
,
in
other
word
,
that
true
virtue
be
,
indeed
,
nothing
else
but
true
taste
.
  
<EOS>
here
our
company
divert
themselves
with
walk
an
hour
or
two
before
the
music
begin
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
seven
,
Booth
alone
have
ever
be

so
that

to
all
the
rest

the
place

with
its
other
charm

have
that
of
novelty
.
<EOS>
when
the
music
play
,
Amelia
,
who
stand
next
to
the
doctor
,
say
to
him
in
a
whisper
,
"
I
hope
I
be
not
guilty
of
profaneness
;
but
,
in
pursuance
of
that
chearful
chain
of

with
which
you

inspire
me
this
afternoon

I
be
just

a
reverie

fancy
myself
in
those
blissful
mansion
which
we
hope
to
enjoy
hereafter

<EOS>
the
delicious
sweetness
of
the
place
,
the
enchanting
charm
of
the
music
,
and
the
satisfaction
which
appear
in
every
one
's
countenance
,
carry
my
soul
almost
to
heaven
in
its
idea
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
,
indeed
,
imagine
there
have
be
anything

<EOS>
the

smile
,
and
say
,
"
You

there
may
be
pleasure
of
which
you
could
conceive
no

and
now
the
little
boy
,
who
have
long
withstand
the
attraction
of
several
cheesecake
that
pass
to

fro

could
contain
no
longer
,
but
ask
his
mother
to
give
him
one
,
say
,
"
I
be
sure
my
sister
would
be
glad
of
another

though
she
be
ashamed
to
ask
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
overhear
the
child
,
propose
that
they
should
all
retire
to
some
place
where
they
may
sit
down
and
refresh
themselves
;
which
they
accordingly
do
.
<EOS>
Amelia

miss

but
,
as
she

and
one
of

she
conclude
herself
and
her
child
to
be
safe

and
doubt
not
but
that
Booth
would
soon
find
her
out
.
  
<EOS>
They
now
sit
down
,
and
the
doctor
very
gallantly
desire
Amelia
to
call
for
what
she
like

<EOS>
upon
which

with
which
while
they
be
regale
themselves
with
the
high
satisfaction
,
two
young
fellow
walk
arm

come
up

and
when
they
come
opposite
to
Amelia
they
stand
still
,
stare
Amelia
full
in
the
face
,
and
one
of
them
cry
aloud
to

one
of

<EOS>
at

give
the

Amelia

fashion
,
and
an
acquaintance
of
Captain
Trent
,
I
should
have
say
nothing
disagreeable
to
her
;
but
,
if
I
have
,
I
ask
her
pardon
,
and
the
company

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
the
dark
,
"
cry
Booth

<EOS>
"
pray
what
be
all
this
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
nothing
of
any
consequence
,
"
cry
the
doctor
,
"
nor
worth
your
enquiring
into
.
<EOS>
You
hear
it
be
a
mistake
of
the
person
,
and
I
really
believe
his
lordship
that
all
proceed
from
his
not
know
to
whom
the

belong

<EOS>
"
  
"
come
,
come
,
"
say
Trent
,
"
there
be
nothing
in
the
matter
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
the
whole
another
time

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
;
since
you
say
so
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
I
be
contented
.
"
<EOS>
so
end
the
affair
,
and
the
two
spark
make
their
congee
,
and
sneak
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
they
be
go
,
"
say
the
young
gentleman
,
"
I
must
say
I
never
see
two
worse
-
breed
jackanape
,
nor
fellow
that
deserve
to
be
kick
more
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
have
them
in
another
place
<EOS>
I
would
have
teach
them
a
little
more
respect
to
the
church

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
take
rather
a
well
way
,
"
answer
the
doctor
,
"
to
teach
them
that
respect
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
now
desire
his
friend
Trent
to
sit
down
with
them
,
and
propose
to
call
for
a
fresh
bottle
of
wine
;
but
Amelia
's
spirit
be
too
much
disconcert
to
give
her
any
prospect
of
pleasure
that
evening
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
lay
hold
of
the
pretence
of
her
child
,
for
whom
she
say
the
hour
be
already
too
late
;
with
which
the
doctor
agree
.
<EOS>
so
they
pay
their
reckoning
and
depart
,
leave
to
the
two
<EOS>
rake
the
triumph
of
have
totally
dissipate
the
mirth
of
this
little
innocent
company
,
who
be
before
enjoy
complete
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
a
curious
conversation
between
the
doctor
,
the
young
clergyman
,
and
the
young
clergyman
's
father
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
when
the
doctor
and
his
two
friend
be
at
breakfast
,
the
young
clergyman
,
in
whose
mind
the
injurious
treatment
he
have
receive
the
evening
before
be
very
deeply
impressed
,
renew
the
conversation
on
that
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
scandal
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
the
government
,
that
they
do
not
preserve
more
respect
to
the
clergy
,
by
punish
all
rudeness
to
them
with
the
utmost
severity
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
justly
observe
of
you
,
sir
,
"
say
he
to
the
doctor
,
"
that
the
low
clergyman
in
England
be
in
real
dignity
superior
to
the
high
nobleman
.
<EOS>
what
then
can
be
so
shocking
as
to
see
that
gown
,
which
ought
to
entitle
us
to
the
veneration
of
all
we
meet
,
treat
with
contempt
and
ridicule
?
<EOS>
be
we
not
,
in
fact
,
ambassador
from
heaven
to
the
world
?
<EOS>
and
do
they
not
,
therefore
,
in
deny
us
our
due
respect
,
deny
it
in
reality
to
Him
that
send
us
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
the
case
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
it
behove
them
to
look
to
themselves
;
for
He
who
send
us
be
able
to
exact
most
severe
vengeance
for
the
ill
treatment
of
His
minister
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
true
,
sir
,
"
cry
the
young
one
;
"
and
I
heartily
hope
He
will
;
but
those
punishment
be
at
too
great
a
distance
to
infuse
terror
into
wicked
mind
.
<EOS>
the
government
ought
to
interfere
with
its
immediate
censure
.
<EOS>
fine
and
imprisonment
and
corporal
punishment
operate
more
forcibly
on
the
human
mind
than
all
the
fear
of
damnation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
so
?
"
<EOS>
cry
the
doctor
;
"
then
I
be
afraid
man
be
very
little
in
earnest
in
those
fear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
most
justly
observe
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
afraid
that
be
too
much
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
that
,
"
say
the
son
,
"
the
government
be
to
blame
.
<EOS>
be
not
book
of
infidelity
,
treat
our
holy
religion
as
a
mere
imposture
,
nay
,
sometimes
as
a
mere
jest
,
publish
daily
,
and
spread
abroad
amongst
the
people
with
perfect
impunity
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
certainly
in
the
right
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
there
be
a
most
blameable
remissness
with
regard
to
these
matter
;
but
the
whole
blame
doth
not
lie
there
;
some
little
share
of
the
fault
be
,
I
be
afraid
,
to
be
impute
to
the
clergy
themselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"
cry
the
young
one
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
that
charge
from
a
gentleman
of
your
cloth
.
<EOS>
do
the
clergy
give
any
encouragement
to
such
book
?
<EOS>
do
they
not
,
on
the
contrary
,
cry
loudly
out
against
the
suffering
them
?
<EOS>
this
be
the
invidious
aspersion
of
the
laity
;
and
I
do
not
expect
to
hear
it
confirm
by
one
of
our
own
cloth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
too
impatient
,
young
gentleman
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
absolutely
confirm
the
charge
of
the
laity
;
it
be
much
too
general
and
too
severe
;
but
even
the
laity
themselves
do
not
attack
them
in
that
part
to
which
you
have
apply
your
defence
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
suppose
such
fool
as
to
attack
that
religion
to
which
they
owe
their
temporal
welfare
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
tax
with
give
any
other
support
to
infidelity
than
what
it
draw
from
the
ill
example
of
their
life
;
I
mean
of
the
life
of
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
here
too
the
laity
carry
their
censure
too
far
;
for
there
be
very
few
or
none
of
the
clergy
whose
life
,
if
compare
with
those
of
the
laity
,
can
be
call
profligate
;
but
such
,
indeed
,
be
the
perfect
purity
of
our
religion
<EOS>
,
such
be
the
innocence
and
virtue
which
it
exact
to
entitle
us
to
its
glorious
reward
and
to
screen
us
from
its
dreadful
punishment
,
that
he
must
be
a
very
good
man
indeed
who
live
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
thus
then
these
person
argue
.
<EOS>
this
man
be
educate
in
a
perfect
knowledge
of
religion
,
be
learn
in
its
law
,
and
be
by
his
profession
oblige
,
in
a
manner
,
to
have
them
always
before
his
eye
.
<EOS>
the
reward
which
it
promise
to
the
obedience
of
these
law
be
so
great
,
and
the
punishment
threaten
on
disobedience
so
dreadful
,
that
it
be
impossible
but
all
man
must
fearfully
fly
from
the
one
,
and
as
eagerly
pursue
the
other
.
<EOS>
if
,
therefore
,
such
a
person
live
in
direct
opposition
to
,
and
in
a
constant
breach
of
,
these
law
,
the
inference
be
obvious
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
pleasant
story
in
Matthew
Paris
,
which
I
will
tell
you
as
well
as
I
can
remember
it
.
<EOS>
two
young
gentleman
,
I
think
they
be
priest
,
agree
together
that
whosoever
die
first
should
return
and
acquaint
his
friend
with
the
secret
of
the
other
world
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
die
soon
after
,
and
fulfil
his
promise
.
<EOS>
the
whole
relation
he
give
be
not
very
material
;
but
,
among
other
thing
,
he
produce
one
of
his
hand
,
which
Satan
have
make
use
of
to
write
upon
,
as
the
modern
do
on
a
card
,
and
have
send
his
compliment
to
the
priest
for
the
number
of
soul
which
the
wicked
example
of
their
life
daily
send
to
hell
.
<EOS>
this
story
be
the
more
remarkable
as
it
be
write
by
a
priest
,
and
a
great
favourer
of
his
order
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
excellent
!
"
cry
the
old
gentleman
;
"
what
a
memory
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
sir
,
"
cry
the
young
one
,
"
a
clergyman
be
a
man
as
well
as
another
;
and
,
if
such
perfect
purity
be
expect
"
  
"
I
do
not
expect
it
,
"
cry
the
doctor
;
"
and
I
hope
it
will
not
be
expect
of
us
.
<EOS>
the
scripture
itself
give
us
this
hope
,
where
the
good
of
us
be
say
to
fall
twenty
time
a
-
day
.
<EOS>
but
sure
we
may
not
allow
the
practice
of
any
of
those
gross
crime
which
contaminate
the
whole
mind
.
<EOS>
We
may
expect
an
obedience
to
the
ten
commandment
,
and
an
abstinence
from
such
notorious
vice
as
,
in
the
first
place
,
Avarice
,
which
,
indeed
,
can
hardly
subsist
without
the
breach
of
more
commandment
than
one
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
would
be
excessive
candour
to
imagine
that
a
man
who
so
visibly
set
his
whole
heart
,
not
only
on
this
world
,
but
on
one
of
the
most
worthless
thing
in
it
(
for
so
be
money
,
without
regard
to
its
use
)
,
should
be
,
at
the
same
time
,
lay
up
his
treasure
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
ambition
be
a
second
vice
of
this
sort
:
we
be
tell
we
can
not
serve
God
and
Mammon
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
apply
this
to
avarice
;
but
I
choose
rather
to
mention
it
here
.
<EOS>
when
we
see
a
man
sneak
about
in
court
and
levee
,
and
do
the
dirty
work
of
great
man
,
from
the
hope
of
preferment
,
can
we
believe
that
a
fellow
whom
we
see
to
have
so
many
hard
task
-
master
upon
earth
ever
think
of
his
Master
which
be
in
heaven
?
<EOS>
Must
he
not
himself
think
,
if
ever
he
reflect
at
all
,
that
so
glorious
a
Master
will
disdain
and
disown
a
servant
who
be
the
dutiful
tool
of
a
court
-
favourite
,
and
employ
either
as
the
pimp
of
his
pleasure
,
or
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
make
a
dirty
channel
to
assist
in
the
conveyance
of
that
corruption
which
be
clog
up
and
destroy
the
very
vital
of
his
country
?
  
<EOS>
"
the
last
vice
which
I
shall
mention
be
Pride
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
in
the
universe
a
more
ridiculous
nor
a
more
contemptible
animal
than
a
proud
clergyman
;
a
turkey
-
cock
or
a
jackdaw
be
object
of
veneration
when
compare
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
,
by
Pride
,
that
noble
dignity
of
mind
to
which
goodness
can
only
administer
an
adequate
object
,
which
delight
in
the
testimony
of
its
own
conscience
,
and
could
not
,
without
the
high
agony
,
bear
its
condemnation
.
<EOS>
by
Pride
I
mean
that
saucy
passion
which
exult
in
every
little
eventual
pre
-
eminence
over
other
man
:
<EOS>
such
be
the
ordinary
gift
of
nature
,
and
the
paultry
present
of
fortune
,
wit
,
knowledge
,
birth
,
strength
,
beauty
,
rich
,
title
,
and
rank
.
<EOS>
that
passion
which
be
ever
aspire
,
like
a
silly
child
,
to
look
over
the
head
of
all
about
them
;
which
,
while
it
servilely
adhere
to
the
great
,
fly
from
the
poor
,
as
if
afraid
of
contamination
;
devour
greedily
every
murmur
of
applause
and
every
look
of
admiration
;
pleased
and
elated
with
all
kind
of
respect
;
and
hurt
and
enflame
with
the
contempt
of
the
low
and
most
despicable
of
fool
,
even
with
such
as
treat
you
last
night
disrespectfully
at
Vauxhall
.
<EOS>
Can
such
a
mind
as
this
be
fix
on
thing
above
?
<EOS>
Can
such
a
man
reflect
that
he
hath
the
ineffable
honour
to
be
employ
in
the
immediate
service
of
his
great
creator
?
<EOS>
or
can
he
please
himself
with
the
heart
-
warm
hope
that
his
way
be
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
that
glorious
,
<EOS>
that
incomprehensible
be

the
old

now
begin

opposition

deliver
the
latter
a
note
from
Amelia

read
immediately
to
himself

word

"
my

SIR

<EOS>
something
hath
happen
since
I
see
you
which
give
me
great
uneasiness

and
I
beg
the
favour

see
you
as
soon

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
's
answer
be
,
that
he
would
wait
on
the
lady
directly
;
and
then
,
turn
to
his
friend
,
he
ask
him
if
he
would
not
take
a
walk
in
the
Park
before
dinner

<EOS>
"
I
must
go

say
he
,
"
to
the
lady
who
be
with
us
last
night
;
for
I
be
afraid
,
by
her
letter
,
some
bad
accident
hath
happen
to
her

<EOS>
come
,
young
gentleman

I
speak
a
little
too
hastily
to
you
just
now

I
ask
your
pardon

allowance
must

make

I

we
shall

both
think
alike

<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
make
his
friend
another
compliment
;

the
young
one
declare
he
hope
he
should
always
think

act
too

It

,
in

I

I

he

my
certain

,
indeed
,
he
hath
be
always
a
fool
in
private
life

for
I
question
whether
he
be
worth
L100

more
than
his

He
hath
give
away

I

I

above
L200

thou

what

in

I

superior

so
far
I
be

I

I
can
account

It

the
common

BOOK
X.

we

<EOS>
the

find
Amelia
alone

for
Booth
be
go
to
walk
with
his
new
-
revive
acquaintance
,
Captain
Trent
,
who
seem
so
pleased
with
the
renewal
of
his
intercourse
with
his
old
brother
-
officer
,
that
he
have
be
almost
continually
with
him
from
the
time
of
their
meeting
at
the
drum
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
acquaint
the
doctor
with
the
purport
of
her
message
,
as
follow
:
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
my
dear
sir
,
for
trouble
you
so
often
with
my
affair
;
but
I
know
your
extreme
readiness
,
as
well
as
ability
,
to
assist
any
one
with
your
advice
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
my
husband
hath
be
present
by
Colonel
James
with
two
ticket
for
a
masquerade
,
which
be
to
be
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
he
insist
so
strongly
on
my
go
with
him
,
that
I
really
do
not
know
how
to
refuse
without
give
him
some
reason
;
and
I
be
not
able
to
invent
any
other
than
the
true
one
,
which
you
would
not
,
I
be
sure
,
advise
me
to
communicate
to
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
have
a
most
narrow
escape
the
other
day
;
for
I
be
almost
draw
in
inadvertently
by
a
very
strange
accident
,
to
acquaint
him
with
the
whole
matter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
relate
the
serjeant
's
dream
,
with
all
the
consequence
that
attend
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
consider
a
little
with
himself
,
and
then
say
,
"
I
be
really
,
child
,
puzzle
as
well
as
you
about
this
matter
.
<EOS>
I
would
by
no
mean
<EOS>
have
you
go
to
the
masquerade
;
I
do
not
indeed
like
the
diversion
itself
,
as
I
have
hear
it
describe
to
me
;
not
that
I
be
such
a
prude
to
suspect
every
woman
who
go
there
of
any
evil
intention
;
but
it
be
a
pleasure
of
too
loose
and
disorderly
a
kind
for
the
recreation
of
a
sober
mind
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
you
have
still
a
strong
and
more
particular
objection
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
myself
to
reason
him
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
it
be
impossible
,
"
answer
she
;
"
and
therefore
I
would
not
set
you
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
him
more
set
on
anything
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
party
,
as
they
call
it
,
make
on
the
occasion
;
and
he
tell
me
my
refusal
will
disappoint
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
not
know
what
to
advise
you
,
"
cry
the
doctor
;
"
I
have
tell
you
I
do
not
approve
of
these
diversion
;
but
<EOS>
yet
,
as
your
husband
be
so
very
desirous
,
I
can
not
think
there
will
be
any
harm
in
go
with
him
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
will
consider
of
it
,
and
do
all
in
my
power
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Mrs.
Atkinson
come
in
,
and
the
discourse
on
this
subject
cease
;
but
soon
after
Amelia
renew
it
,
say
there
be
no
occasion
to
keep
anything
a
secret
from
her
friend
.
<EOS>
They
then
fall
to
debate
on
the
subject
,
but
could
not
come
to
any
resolution
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
who
be
in
an
unusual
flow
of
spirit
,
cry
out
,
"
fear
nothing
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Amelia
,
two
woman
surely
will
be
too
hard
for
one
man
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
doctor
,
it
exceed
Virgil
:
  
<EOS>
Una
dolo
divum
si
faemina
victa

.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
well
repeat
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
cry
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
understand
all
Virgil
as
well
as
you
seem
to
do
that
line
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
do
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
Horace
too
;
or
else
my
father
throw
away
his
time
to
very
little
purpose
in
teach

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
madam
,
"
cry
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
I
own
it
be
an
impertinent
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
sir
,
"
say
she
;
"
and
if
you
be
one
of
those
who
imagine
woman
incapable
of
learning
,
I
shall
not
be
offend
at
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
common
opinion
;
but
  
interdum
vulgus
rectum
videt
,
est
ubi
peccat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
to
profess
such
an
opinion
,
madam
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
Madam
Dacier
and
yourself
would
bear
testimony
against
me
.
<EOS>
the
utmost
indeed
that
I
should
venture
would
be
to
question
the
utility
of
learn
in
a
young
lady
's
education
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
own
,
"
say
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
"
<EOS>
as
the
world
be
constitute
,
it
can
not
be
as
serviceable
to
her
fortune
as
it
will
be
to
that
of
a
man
;
but
you
will
allow
,
doctor
,
that
learning
may
afford
a
woman
,
at
least
,
a
reasonable
and
an
innocent
entertainment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
suppose
,
"
cry
the
doctor
,
"
it
may
have
its
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
as
,
for
instance
,
if
a
learn
lady
should
meet
with
an
unlearned
husband
,
may
she
not
be
apt
to
despise
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Atkinson
 
"
and
,
if
I
may
be
allow
the
instance
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
have
shew
,
myself
,
that
woman
who
have
learn
themselves
can
be
content
without
that
qualification
in
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
"
cry
the
doctor
,
"
there
may
be
other
qualification
which
may
have
their
weight
in
the
balance
.
<EOS>
but
let
us
take
the
other
side
of
the
question
,
and
suppose
the
learn
of
both
sex
to
meet
in
the
matrimonial
union
,
may
it
not
afford
one
excellent
subject
of
disputation
,
which
be
the
most
learned
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
at
all
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Atkinson
;
"
for
,
if
they
have
both
learning
and
good
sense
,
they
would
soon
see
on
which
side
the
superiority
lie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
the
learned
man
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
should
be
a
little
unreasonable
in
his
opinion
,
be
you
sure
that
the
learned
woman
would
preserve
her
duty
to
her
husband
,
and
submit
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
"
must
we
necessarily
suppose
that
a
learned
man
would
be
unreasonable
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
madam
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
I
be
not
your
husband
;
and
you
shall
not
hinder
me
from
suppose
what
I
please
.
<EOS>
surely
it
be
not
such
a
paradox
to
conceive
that
a
man
of
learning
should
be
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
be
there
no
unreasonable
opinion
in
very
learned
author
,
even
among
the
critic
themselves
?
<EOS>
for
instance
,
what
can
be
a
more
strange
,
and
indeed
unreasonable
opinion
,
than
to
prefer
the
Metamorphoses
of
Ovid
to
the
AEneid
of
Virgil
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
indeed
so
strange
,
"
cry
the
lady
,
"
that
you
shall
not
persuade
me
it
be
ever
the
opinion
of
any
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
not
,
"
cry
the
doctor
;
"
and
I
believe
you
and
I
should
not
differ
in
our
judgment
of
any
person
who
maintain
such
an
opinion
 
<EOS>
what
a
taste
must
he
have

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a

contemptible
one
indeed

Mrs.
Atkinson

<EOS>
"
I
be
satisfied

in

of
your
own
Horace
,
Verbum
non

addam

<EOS>
"
  
"
but
how
provoking
be
this
,
"
cry
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
"
to
draw
one
in
such
a
manner
!
<EOS>
I
protest
I
be
so
warm
in
the
defence
of
my
favourite
Virgil
,
that
I
be
not
aware
of
your
design
;
but
all
your
triumph
depend
on
a
supposition
that
one
should
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
meet
with
the
silly
fellow
in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
in

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Bentley
be
not
such
a

yet
he
would
have
quarrel

I
be
convince

with
any
wife
in

in
behalf
of
one
of
his
correction

<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
he
would
have
give
up
his
Ingentia
Fata

may

be

Nay

concerned

I
have
the
advantage

<EOS>
"
nor
doth
she
understand
much
well

yourself

in

pardon

pardon
me

You
have
hear

that

perhaps

have

<EOS>
Mrs.
Atkinson
have
just
time
to
tell
the
doctor
he
be
a
provoking
creature
,
before
the
arrival
of
Booth
and
his
friend
put
an
end
to
that
learn
discourse
,
in
which
neither
of
the
party
have
greatly
recommend
themselves
to
each
other
;
the
doctor
's
opinion
of
the
lady
be
not
at
all
heighten
by
her
progress
in
the
classic
,
and
<EOS>
she
,
on
the
other
hand
,
have
conceive
a
great
dislike
in
her
heart
towards
the
doctor
,
which
would
have
rage
,
perhaps
,
with
no
less
fury
from
the
consideration
that
he
have
be
her
husband
.
    
<EOS>
what
happen
at
the
masquerade
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
time
to
the
day
of
the
masquerade
nothing
happen
of
consequence
enough
to
have
a
place
in
this
history
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
day
Colonel
James
come
to
Booth
's
about
nine
in
the
evening
,
where
he
stay
for
Mrs.
James
,
who
do
not
come
till
near
eleven
.
<EOS>
the
four
masque
then
set
out
together
in
several
chair
,
and
all
proceed
to
the
Haymarket
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
at
the
Opera
-
house
the
colonel
and
Mrs.
James
presently
leave
them
;
nor
do
Booth
and
his
lady
remain
long
together
,
but
be
soon
divide
from
each
other
by
different
masque
.
  
<EOS>
a
domino
soon
accost
the
lady
,
and
have
her
away
to
the
upper
end
of
the
farth
room
on
the
right
hand
,
where
both
the
masque
sit
down
;
nor
be
it
long
before
the
he
domino
begin
to
make
very
fervent
love
to
the
she
.
<EOS>
It
would
,
perhaps
,
be
tedious
to
the
reader
to
run
through
the
whole
process
,
which
be
not
indeed
in
the
most
romantick
stile
.
<EOS>
the
lover
seem
to
consider
his
mistress
as
a
mere
woman
of
this
world
,
and
seem
rather
to
apply
to
her
avarice
and
ambition
than
to
her
soft
passion
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
be
not
so
careful
to
conceal
his
true
voice
as
the
lady
be
,
she
soon
discover
that
this
lover
of
her
's
be
no
other
than
her
old
friend
the
peer
,
and
presently
a
thought
suggest
itself
to
her
of
make
an
advantage
of
this
accident
.
<EOS>
She
give
him
therefore
an
intimation
that
she
know
him
,
and
express
some
astonishment
at
his
have
find
her
out
.
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
,
"
say
she
,
"
my
lord
,
that
you
have
a
friend
in
the
woman
where
I
now
lodge
,
as
well
as
you
have
in
Mrs.
Ellison
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
protest
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
to
which
she
answer
,
"
Nay
,
my
lord
,
do
not
defend
her
so
earnestly
till
you
be
sure
I
should
have
be
angry
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
,
which
be
accompany
with
a
very
bewitching
softness
,
my
lord
fly
into
rapture
rather
too
strong
for
the
place
he
be
in
.
<EOS>
these
the
lady
gently
check
,
and
beg
him
to
take
care
<EOS>
they
be
not
observe
;
for
that
her
husband
,
for
aught
she
know
,
be
then
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Colonel
James
come
now
up
,
and
say
,
"
so
,
madam
,
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
find
you
again
;
I
have
be
extremely
miserable
since
I
lose
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
lady
answer
in
her
masquerade
voice
that
she
do
not
know
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
Colonel
James
,
"
say
he
,
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
"
answer
she
,
"
you
be
mistaken
;
I
have
no
acquaintance
with
any
Colonel
James
.
"
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
answer
he
,
in
a
whisper
likewise
,
"
I
be
positive
I
be
not
mistaken
,
you
be
certainly
Mrs.
Booth
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
be
very
impertinent
,
and
I
beg
you
will
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lord
then
interpose
,
and
,
speak
in
his
own
voice
,
assure
the
colonel
that
the
lady
be
a
woman
of
quality
,
and
that
they
be
engage
in
a
conversation
together
;
upon
which
the
colonel
ask
the
lady
's
pardon
;
for
,
as
there
be
nothing
remarkable
in
her
dress
,
he
really
believe
he
have
be
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
go
again
a
hunting
through
the
room
,
and
soon
after
find
Booth
walk
without
his
mask
between
two
lady
,
one
of
whom
be
in
a
blue
domino
,
and
the
other
in
the
dress
of
a
shepherdess

the

SIR
,
 
I
be
very
sorry
to
have
any
occasion
of
write
on
the
follow
subject
in
a
country
that
be
honour
with
the
name
of
Christian
;
much
more
am
I
concerned
to
address
myself
to
a
man
whose
many
advantage
,
derive
both
from
nature
and
fortune
,
should
demand
the
high
return
of
gratitude
to
the
great
Giver
of
all
those
good
thing
.
<EOS>
be
not
such
a
man
guilty
of
the
high
ingratitude
to
that
most
beneficent
being
,
by
a
direct
and
avow
disobedience
of
his
most
positive
law
and
command
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
tell
you
that
adultery
be
forbid
in
the
law
of
the
decalogue
;
nor
need
I
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
mention
that
it
be
expressly
forbid
in
the
New
Testament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
therefore
,
"
say
the
orator
,
"
what
the
law
be
,
and
therefore
none
of
you
will
be
able
to
plead
ignorance
when
you
come
to
the
Old
Bailey
in
the
other
world

<EOS>
but
here
go
again
:
 
"
  
"
if
it
have
not
be
so
expressly
forbid
in
scripture
,
still
the
law
of
Nature
would
have
yield
light
enough
for
us
to
have
discover
the
great
horror
and
atrociousness
of
this
crime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
accordingly
we
find
that
nation
,
where
the
Sun
of
righteousness
hath
yet
never
shine
,
have
punish
the
adulterer
with
the
most
exemplary
pain
and
penalty
;
not
only
the
polite
heathen
,
but
the
most
barbarous
nation
,
have
concur
in
these
;
in
many
place
the
most
severe
and
shameful
corporal
punishment
,
and
in
some
,
and
those
not
a
few
,
death
itself
hath
be
inflict
on
this
crime
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
sure
in
a
human
sense
there
be
scarce
any
guilt
which
deserve
to
be
more
severely
punish
.
<EOS>
It
include
in
it
almost
every
injury
and
every
mischief
which
one
man
can
do
to
,
or
can
bring
on
,
another

<EOS>
It
be
rob
him
of
his
property
 
"
  
"
mind
that
,
lady
,
"
say
the
orator
;
"
you
be
all
the
property
of
your
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
of
that
property
which
,
if
he
be
a
good
man
,
he
value
above
all
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
poison
that
fountain
whence
<EOS>
he
hath
a
right
to
derive
the
sweetest
and
most
innocent
pleasure
,
the
most
cordial
comfort
,
the
most
solid
friendship
,
and
most
faithful
assistance
in
all
his
affair
,
want
,
and
distress
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
destruction
of
his
peace
of
mind
,
and
even
of
his
reputation
.
<EOS>
the
ruin
of
both
wife
and
husband
,
and
sometimes
of
the
whole
family
,
be
the
probable
consequence
of
this
fatal
injury
.
<EOS>
domestic
happiness
be
the
end
of
almost
all
our
pursuit
,
and
the
common
reward
of
all
our
pain
.
<EOS>
when
man
find
themselves
for
ever
bar
from
this
delightful
fruition
,
they
be
lose
to
all
industry
,
and
grow
careless
of
all
their
worldly
affair
.
<EOS>
thus
they
become
bad
subject
,
bad
relation
,
bad
friend
,
and
bad
man
.
<EOS>
hatred
and
revenge
be
the
wretched
passion
which
boil
in
their
mind
.
<EOS>
despair
and
madness
very
commonly
ensue
,
and
murder
and
suicide
often
close
the
dreadful
scene
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
thus
,
gentleman
and
lady
,
you
see
the
scene
be
closed
.
<EOS>
so
here
end
the
first
act
 
and
thus
begin
the
second
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
here
attempt
to
lay
before
you
a
picture
of
this
vice
,
the
horror
of
which
no
colour
of
mine
can
exaggerate
.
<EOS>
but
what
pencil
can
delineate
the
horror
of
that
punishment
which
the
scripture
denounce
against
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
for
what
will
you
subject
yourself
to
this
punishment
?
<EOS>
or
for
what
reward
will
you
inflict
all
this
misery
on
another
?
<EOS>
I
will
add
,
on
your
friend
?
<EOS>
for
the
possession
of
a
woman
;
for
the
pleasure
of
a
moment
?
<EOS>
but
,
if
neither
virtue
nor
religion
can
restrain
your
inordinate
appetite
,
be
there
not
many
woman
as
handsome
as
your
friend
's
wife
,
whom
,
though
not
with
innocence
,
you
may
possess
with
a
much
less
degree
of
guilt
?
<EOS>
what
motive
then
can
thus
hurry
you
on
to
the
destruction
of
yourself
and
your
friend

the

of
the

add

the

but
if
you
can
be
so
lose
to
all
sense
of
fear
,
and
of
shame
,
and
of
goodness
,
as
not
to
be
debar
by
the
evil
which
you
be
to
bring
on
yourself
,
by
the
extreme
baseness
of
the
action
,
nor
by
the
ruin
in
which
you
be
to
involve

,
let
me
still
urge
the
difficulty
,
I
may
say
,
the
impossibility
of
the
success
.
<EOS>
You
be
attack
a
fortress
on
a
rock
;
a
chastity
so
strongly
defended
,
as
well
by
a
happy
natural
disposition
of
mind
as
by
the
strong
principle
of
religion
and
virtue
,
implant
by
education
and
nourish
and
improve
by
habit
,
that
the
woman
must
be
invincible
even
without
that
firm
and
constant
affection
of
her
husband
which
would
guard
a
much
loose
and
worse
-
dispose
heart
.
<EOS>
what
therefore
be
you
attempt
but
to
introduce
distrust
,
and
perhaps
disunion
,
between
an
innocent
and
a
happy
couple
,
in
which
too
you
can
not
succeed
without
bring
,
I
be
convince
,
certain
destruction
on
your
own
head
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
desist
,
therefore
,
let
me
advise
you
,
from
this
enormous
crime
;
retreat
from
the
vain
attempt
of
climb
a
precipice
which
it
be
impossible
<EOS>
you
should
ever
ascend
,
where
you
must
probably
soon
fall
into
utter
perdition
,
and
can
have
no
other
hope
but
of
drag
down
your
good
friend
into
perdition
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
think
of
but
one
argument
more
,
and
that
,
indeed
,
a
very
bad
one
;
you
throw
away
that
time
in
an
impossible
attempt

which
may
,
in
other
place
,
crown
your
sinful
endeavour
with
success

away

the

do
not

to
give

badly
as

there
be
some
passage
in

have
please
the

He
have
just
go
through

Booth
pass
by
him

upon

the

call
to
him

,
deliver
him
the
letter

bid
him
put
it
in

read

make
many
encomium
upon

it

Booth
have
not

see
his

,
as
he
conclude
she
be
safe
with
Mrs.
James

he
be
not
uneasy

He
have
be
prevent
search
farther
after
her

the
lady
in
the
blue
domino

who
have
join
him
again

<EOS>
Booth
have
now
make
these
discovery
:
that
the

be
pretty
well
acquaint
with
him
,
that
she
be
a
woman
of
fashion
,
and
that
she
have
a
particular
regard
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
he
be
a
gay
man
,
he
be
in
reality
so
fond
of
his
Amelia
,
that
he
think
of
no
other
woman
;
wherefore
,
though
not
absolutely
a
Joseph
,
as
we
have
already
see
,
yet
could
he
not
be
guilty
of
premeditated
inconstancy

<EOS>
He
be
indeed
so
very
cold

insensible
to
the
hint
which
be
give
him
,
that
the
lady
begin
to
complain
of
his
dullness

when
the
shepherdess
again
come
up

hear
this
accusation
against
him

she
confirm
it

say
,

I
do
assure
you

indeed

I
should
almost
take
you
for

by
find

then
go
off

to
herself

satisfy
the

be
some
wretched
creature

nobody
know

the
shepherdess
overhear
the
sarcasm
,

answer
it
by
ask
Booth
what
contemptible
wretch
he
have
pick
up
?

<EOS>
indeed

madam

he
,
"
you
know
as
much

now
give
it

you
have
the
assurance
then

in

own
voice

affect
not

do
you

the
high
barbarity

no

harden

I
confess
that

you
have
the
most
reason

what
you

"
  
<EOS>
here
a
long
dialogue
ensue
between
the
gentleman
and
the
lady
,
whom
,
I
suppose
,
I
need
not
mention
to
have
be
Miss
Matthews
;
<EOS>
but
,
as
it
consist
chiefly
of
violent
upbraiding
on
her
side
,
and
excuse
on
his
,
I
despair
of
make
it
entertaining
to
the
reader
,
and
shall
therefore
return
to
the
colonel
,
who
,
have
search
all
the
room
with
the
utmost
diligence
,
without
find
the
woman
he
look
for
,
begin
to
suspect
that
he
have
before
fix
on
the
right
person
,
and
that
Amelia
have
deny
herself
to
him
,
be
pleased
with
her
paramour
,
whom
he
have
discover
to
be
the
noble
peer
.
  
<EOS>
He
resolve
,
therefore
,
as
he
could
have
no
sport
himself
,
to
spoil
that
of
other
;
accordingly
he
find
out
Booth
,
and
ask
him
again
what
be
become
of
both
their
wife
;
for
that
he
have
search
all
over
the
room
,
and
could
find
neither
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
now
a
little
alarmed
at
this
account
,
and
,
part
with
Miss
Matthews
,
go
along
with
the
colonel
in
search
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
as
for
Miss
Matthews
,
he
have
at
length
pacify
her
with
a
promise
to
make
her
a
visit
;
which
promise
she
extort
from
him
,
swear
bitterly
,
in
the
most
solemn
manner
,
unless
he
make
it
to
her
,
she
would
expose
both
him
and
herself
at
the
masquerade
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
know
the
violence
of
the
lady
's
passion
,
and
to
what
height
they
be
capable
of
rise
,
he
be
oblige
to
come
in
to
these
term
:
for
he
have
,
I
be
convinced
,
no
fear
upon
earth
equal
to
that
of
<EOS>
Amelia
's
know
what
it
be
in
the
power
of
Miss
Matthews
to
communicate
to
her
,
and
which
to
conceal
from
her
,
he
have
already
undergo
so
much
uneasiness
.
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
lead
Booth
directly
to
the
place
where
he
have
see
the
peer
and
Amelia
(
such
he
be
now
well
convinced
she
be
)
sit
together
.
<EOS>
Booth
no
sooner
see
her
than
he
say
to
the
colonel
,
"
sure
that
be
my
wife
in
conversation
with
that
masque
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
take
her
for
your
lady
myself
,
"
say
the
colonel
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
find
I
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
that
be
my
Lord
 
,
and
I
have
see
that
very
lady
with
him
all
this
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
conversation
past
at
a
little
distance
,
and
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
suppose
Amelia
;
when
Booth
,
look
stedfastly
at
the
lady
,
declare
with
an
oath
that
he
be
positive
the
colonel
be
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
She
then
beckon
to
him
with
her
fan
;
upon
which
he
go
directly
to
her
,
and
she
ask
him
to
go
home
,
which
he
very
readily
consent
to
.
<EOS>
the
peer
then
walk
off
:
the
colonel
go
in
pursuit
of
his
wife
,
or
of
some
other
woman
;
and
Booth
and
his
lady
return
in
two
chair
to
their
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
Consequences
of
the
masquerade
,
not
uncommon
nor
surprizing
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
,
get
first
out
of
her
chair
,
run
hastily
up
into
the
nursery
to
the
child
;
for
such
be
Amelia
's
constant
method
at
her
return
home
,
at
whatever
hour
.
<EOS>
Booth
then
walk
into
the
dining
-
room
,
where
he
have
not
be
long
before
Amelia
come
down
to
him
,
and
,
with
a
most
chearful
countenance
,
say
,
"
My

I
fancy
we
have
neither
of

shall
I
go
down
and
see
whether

any
cold
meat
in
the
house

<EOS>
"
for
yourself

I
shall
eat
nothing

<EOS>
"

say
Amelia
;

I
hope
you
have
not
lose
your
appetite
at

<EOS>
for
supper
be
a
meal
at
which
he
generally
eat
very
heartily

<EOS>
"
I
know
not
well

what

spend
the
whole
evening
with
a
masque
without
know
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
why

my

"
say
she
,
"
you
know
we

not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
we

he
,

but
what
be
that
to
the
purpose
?
<EOS>
sure
you
answer
me
strangely
.
<EOS>
I
know
we
be
not
together
;
and
therefore
I
ask
you
whom
you
be
with

"
  
"
<EOS>
Nay

,
my

"
can
I
tell
people
in
masque
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
again
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
would
you
converse
two
hour
or
more
with
a
masque
whom
you
do
not
know
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
child
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
know
nothing
of
the
method
of
a
masquerade
;
for
I
never
be
at
one
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
Heaven
you
have
not
be
at
this
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
nay
,
you
will
wish
so
yourself
if
you
tell
me
truth

<EOS>
what
have
I
say
?
<EOS>
do
I
 
<EOS>
can
I
suspect
you
of
not
speak
truth
?
<EOS>
since
you
be
ignorant
then
I
will
inform
you
:
the
man
you
have
converse
with
be
no
other
than
Lord

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
that
the
reason
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
wish
I
have
not

there

"
and
be
not
that
reason

he
,

sufficient
?

be
he
not
the
last
man
upon
earth
with
whom
I
would
have
you
converse
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
really
wish
then
that
I
have
not

at
the
masquerade

<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
cry
he
,
"
from
my
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
may
I
ever
be
able
,
"
cry
she
,
"
to
indulge
you
in
every
wish
as
in
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
trifle
,
Amelia
,
"
cry
he
;
"
you
would
not
jest
with
me
if
you
know
the
situation
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
do
not

with
you
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
upon
my
honour
I
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
forgive
me
this
first
deceit
I
ever
practise
,
and
indeed
it
shall
be
the
last
;
for
I
have
pay
severely
for
this
by
the
uneasiness
it
hath
give
me
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
reveal
to
him
the
whole
secret
,
which
be
thus
:
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
hath
be
already
mention
in
some
part
of
this
history
that
Amelia
and
Mrs.
Atkinson
be
exactly
of
the
same
make
and
stature
,
and
that
there
be
likewise
a
very
near
resemblance
between
their
voice
.
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
therefore
,
find
that
Amelia
be
so
extremely
averse
to
the
masquerade
,
she
propose
to
go
thither
in
her
stead
,
and
to
pass
upon
Booth
for
his
own
wife
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
afterwards
very
easily
execute
;
for
,
when
they
leave
Booth
's
lodging
,
Amelia
,
who
go
last
to
her
chair
,
run
back
to
fetch
her
masque
,
as
she
pretend
,
which
she
have
purposely
leave
behind
.
<EOS>
She
then
whipt
off
her
domino
,
and
throw
it
over
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
who
stand
ready
to
receive
it
,
and
run
immediately
downstairs
,
and
,
step
into
Amelia
's
chair
,
proceed
with
the
rest
to
the
masquerade
.
  
<EOS>
as
her
stature
exactly
suit
that
of
Amelia
,
she
have
very
little
difficulty
to
carry
on
the
imposition
;
for
,
besides
the
natural
resemblance
of
their
voice
,
and
the
opportunity
of
speak
in
a
feign
one
,
she
have
scarce
an
intercourse
of
six
word
with
Booth
during
the
whole
time
;
for
the
moment
they
get
into
the
croud
<EOS>
she
take
the
first
opportunity
of
slip
from
him
.
<EOS>
and
he
,
as
the
reader
may
remember
,
be
seize
by
other
woman
,
and
conclude
his
wife
to
be
safe
with
Mrs.
James
,
be
very
well
satisfied
,
till
the
colonel
set
him
upon
the
search
,
as
we
have
see
before
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
the
moment
she
come
home
,
run
upstairs
to
the
nursery
,
where
she
find
Amelia
,
and
tell
her
in
haste
that
she
may
very
easily
carry
on
the
deceit
with
her
husband
;
for
that
she
may
tell
him
what
she
please
to
invent
,
as
they
have
not
be
a
minute
together
during
the
whole
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
no
sooner
satisfied
that
his
wife
have
not
be
from
home
that
evening
than
he
fall
into
rapture
with
her
,
give
her
a
thousand
tender
caress
,
blame
his
own
judgment
,
acknowledge
the
goodness
of
hers
,
and
vow
never
to
oppose
her
will
more
in
any
one
instance
during
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
who
be
still
in
the
nursery
with
her
masquerade
dress
,
be
then
summon
down
-
stair
,
and
,
when
Booth
see
her
and
hear
her
speak
in
her
mimic
tone
,
he
declare
he
be
not
surprize
at
his
have
be
impose
upon
,
for
that
,
if
they
be
both
in
the
same
disguise
,
he
should
scarce
be
able
to
discover
the
difference
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
then
sit
down
to
half
an
hour
's
chearful
conversation
,
after
which
they
retire
all
in
the
most
perfect
good
humour
.
    
<EOS>
Consequences
of
the
masquerade
.
 
<EOS>
when
Booth
rise
in
the
morning
he
find
in
his
pocket
that
letter
which
have
be
deliver
to
him
by
Colonel
Bath
,
which
,
have
not
chance
bring
to
his
remembrance
,
he
may
possibly
have
never
recollect
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
now
,
however
,
the
curiosity
to
open
the
letter
,
and
begin
to
read
it
,
the
matter
of
it
draw
him
on
till
he
peruse
the
whole
;
for
,
notwithstanding
the
contempt
cast
upon
it
by
those
learn
critic
the
buck
,
neither
the
subject
nor
the
manner
in
which
it
be
treat
be
altogether
contemptible
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
still
another
motive
which
induce
Booth
to
read
the
whole
letter
,
and
this
be
,
that
he
presently
think
he
know
the
hand
.
<EOS>
He
do
,
indeed
,
immediately
conclude
it
be
Dr
Harrison
;
for
the
doctor
write
a
very
remarkable
one
,
and
this
letter
contain
all
the
particularity
of
the
doctor
's
character
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
just
finish
a
second
reading
of
this
letter
when
the
doctor
himself
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
good
man
be
impatient
to
know
the
success
of
Amelia
's
stratagem
,
for
he
bear
towards
her
all
that
love
which
esteem
can
create
in
a
good
mind
,
without
the
assistance
of
those
selfish
consideration
from
which
the
love
of
wife
and
child
may
be
ordinarily
deduce
.
<EOS>
the
latter
of
which
,
Nature
,
by
very
subtle
and
refined
reasoning
,
suggest
to
us
to
be
part
of
our
dear
self
;
and
the
former
,
as
long
as
they
remain
the
object
of
our
liking
,
that
same
Nature
be
furnish
with
very
plain
and
fertile
argument
to
recommend
to
our
affection
.
<EOS>
but
to
raise
that
affection
in
the
human
breast
which
the
doctor
have
for
Amelia
,
Nature
be
force
to
use
a
kind
of
logic
which
be
no
more
understand
by
a
bad
man
than
Sir
Isaac
Newton
's
doctrine
of
colour
be
by
one
bear
blind
.
<EOS>
and
yet
in
reality
it
contain
nothing
more
abstruse
than
this
,
that
an
injury
be
the
object
of
anger
,
danger
of
fear
,
and
praise
of
vanity
;
for
in
the
same
simple
manner
it
may
be
assert
that
goodness
be
the
object
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
enquire
immediately
for
his
child
(
for
so
he
often
call
Amelia
)
;
Booth
answer
that
he
have
leave
her
asleep
,
for
that
she
have
have
but
a
restless
night
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
be
not
disorder
by
the
masquerade
,
"
cry
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
Booth
answer
he
believe
she
would
be
very
well
when
she
wake
.
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
,
"
say
he
,
"
her
gentle
spirit
be
a
little
too
much
flutter
last
night
;
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
then
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
you
will
never
more
insist
on
her
go
to
such
place
,
but
know
your
own
happiness
in
have
a
wife
that
hath
the
discretion
to
avoid
those
place
;
which
,
though
perhaps
they
may
not
be
as
some
represent
them
,
such
brothel
of
vice
and
debauchery
as
would
impeach
the
character
of
every
virtuous
woman
who
be
see
at
them
,
be
certainly
,
however
,
scene
of
riot
,
disorder
,
and
intemperance
,
very
improper
to
be
frequent
by
a
chaste
and
sober
christian
matron
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
declare
that
he
be
very
sensible
of
his
error
,
and
that
,
so
far
from
solicit
his
wife
to
go
to
another
masquerade
,
he
do
not
intend
ever
to
go
thither
any
more
himself
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
highly
approve
the
resolution
;
and
then
Booth
say
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
thank
you
,
my
dear
friend
,
as
well
as
my
wife
's
discretion
,
that
she
be
not
at
the
masquerade
last
night
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
relate
to
the
doctor
the
discovery
of
the
plot
;
and
the
good
man
be
greatly
pleased
with
the
success
of
the
stratagem
,
and
that
Booth
take
it
in
such
good
part
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
sir
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
I
have
a
letter
give
me
by
a
noble
colonel
there
,
which
be
write
in
a
hand
so
very
like
yours
,
that
I
could
almost
swear
to
it
.
<EOS>
nor
be
the
stile
,
as
far
as
I
can
guess
,
unlike
your
own
.
<EOS>
here
it
be
,
sir
.
<EOS>
do
you
own
the
letter
,
doctor
,
or
<EOS>
do
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
take
the
letter
,
and
,
have
look
at
it
a
moment
,
say
,
"
<EOS>
and
do
the
colonel
himself
give
you
this
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
colonel
himself
,
"
answer
Booth
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
"
cry
the
doctor
,
"
he
be
surely
the
most
impudent
fellow
that
the
world
ever
produce
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
do
he
deliver
it
with
an
air
of
triumph
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
deliver
it
me
with
air
enough
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
after
his
own
manner
,
and
bid
me
read
it
for
my
edification
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
be
a
little
surprized
that
he
should
single
me
out
of
all
mankind
to
deliver
the
letter
to
;
I
do
not
think
I
deserve
the
character
of
such
a
husband
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
I
be
not
so
very
forward
to
take
an
affront
as
some
folk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
see
you
be
not
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
and
your
behaviour
in
this
affair
become
both
the
man
of
sense
and
the
Christian
;
for
it
would
be
surely
the
great
folly
,
as
well
as
the
most
daring
impiety
,
to
risque
your
own
life
for
the
impertinence
of
a
fool
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
you
be
assure
of
the
virtue
of
your
own
wife
,
it
be
wisdom
in
you
to
despise
the
effort
of
such
a
wretch
.
<EOS>
not
,
indeed
,
that
your
wife
accuse
him
of
any
downright
attack
,
though
she
hath
observe
enough
in
his
behaviour
to
give
offence
to
her
delicacy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
astonish
me
,
doctor
,
"
say
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
what
can
you
mean
?
<EOS>
my
wife
dislike
his
behaviour
!
<EOS>
hath
<EOS>
the
colonel
ever
offend
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
he
hath
ever
offend
her
by
any
open
declaration
;
nor
hath
he
do
anything
which
,
accord
to
the
most
romantic
notion
of
honour
,
you
can
or
ought
to
resent
;
but
there
be
something
extremely
nice
in
the
chastity
of
a
truly
virtuous
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
hath
my
wife
really
complain
of
anything
of
that
kind
in
the
colonel
?
"
  
"
look
ye
,
young
gentleman
,
"
cry
the
doctor
;
"
I
will
have
no
quarrelling
or
challenging
;
I
find
I
have
make
some
mistake
,
and
therefore
I
insist
upon
it
by
all
the
right
of
friendship
,
that
you
give
me
your
word
of
honour
<EOS>
you
will
not
quarrel
with
the
colonel
on
this
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
with
all
my
heart
,
"
say
Booth
;
"
for
,
if
I
do
not
know
your
character
,
I
should
absolutely
think
you
be
jest
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
you
have
mistake
my
wife
,
but
I
be
sure
she
hath
mistake
the
colonel
,
and
hath
misconstrue
some
over
-
strain
point
of
gallantry
,
something
of
the
Quixote
kind
,
into
a
design
against
her
chastity
;
but
I
have
that
opinion
of
the
colonel
,
that
I
hope
you
will
not
be
offend
when
I
declare
I
know
not
which
of
you
<EOS>
two
<EOS>
I
should
be
the
sooner
jealous
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
by
no
mean
have
you
jealous
of
any
one
,
"
cry
the
doctor
;
"
for
I
think
my
child
's
virtue
may
be
firmly
rely
on
;
but
I
be
convinced
she
would
not
have
say
what
she
do
to
me
without
a
cause
;
nor
should
I
,
without
such
a
conviction
,
have
write
that
letter
to
the
colonel
,
as
I
own
to
you
<EOS>
I
do
.
<EOS>
however
,
nothing
I
say
hath
yet
past
which
,
even
in
the
opinion
of
false
honour
,
you
be
at
liberty
to
resent
!
<EOS>
but
as
to
decline
any
great
intimacy
,
if
you
will
take
my
advice
,
I
think
that
would
be
prudent
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
pardon
me
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
really
such
an
opinion
of
the
colonel
that
I
would
pawn
my
life
upon
his
honour
;
and
as
for
woman
,
I
do
not
believe
he
ever
have
an
attachment
to
any
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
so
,
"
say
the
doctor
:
"
I
have
only
two
thing
to
insist
on
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
,
that
,
if
ever
you

this
letter
may
not

the
subject

any
quarrelling

the
other
be
,
that
you
never
mention
a
word
of
this
to
your

<EOS>
by
the
latter
I
shall
see
whether
you
can
keep
a
secret
;
and
,
if
it
be
no
otherwise
material
,
it
will
be
a
wholesome
exercise
to

for
the
practice
of

a
kind
of
mental
exercise

to
maintain
the
health
and

of

<EOS>

I
faithfully
promise
both

cry
Booth
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
breakfast
enter
the
room
,
as
do
soon
after
Amelia
and
Mrs.
Atkinson
.
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
run
chiefly
on
the
masquerade
;
and
Mrs.
Atkinson
give
an
account
of
several
adventure
there
;
but
whether
she
tell
the
whole
truth
with
regard
to
herself
I
will
not
determine
,
for
,
certain
it
be
,
she
never
once
mention
the
name
of
the
noble
peer
.
<EOS>
amongst
the
rest
,
she
say
there
be
a
young
fellow
that
have
preach
a
sermon
there
upon
a
stool
,
in
praise
of
adultery
<EOS>
,
she
believe
;
for
she
could
not
get
near
enough
to
hear
the
particular
.
  
<EOS>
during
that
transaction
Booth
have
be
engage
with
the
blue
domino
in
another
room
,
so
that
he
know
nothing
of
it
;
so
that
what
Mrs.
Atkinson
have
now
say
only
bring
to
his
mind
the
doctor
's
letter
to
Colonel
Bath
,
for
to
him
he
suppose
it
be
write
;
and
the
idea
of
the
colonel
be
a
lover
to
Amelia
<EOS>
strike
him
in
so
ridiculous
a
light
,
that
it
throw
him
into
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
who
,
from
the
natural
jealousy
of
an
author
,
impute
the
agitation
of
Booth
's
muscle
to
his
own
sermon
or
letter
on
that
subject
,
be
a
little
offended
,
and
say
gravely
,
"
I
should
be
glad
to
know
the
reason
of
this
immoderate
mirth
.
<EOS>
be
adultery
a
matter
of
jest
in
your
opinion
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
far
otherwise

answer
Booth
.
<EOS>

but
how
be
it
possible
to
refrain
from
laughter
at
the
idea
of
a
fellow
preach
a
sermon
in
favour
of
it
at
such
a
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
,
"
cry
the
doctor
,
"
to
find
the
age
be
grow
to
so
scandalous
a
degree
of
licentiousness
,
that
we
have
throw
off
not
only
virtue
,
but
decency
.
<EOS>
how
abandon
must
be
the
manner
of
any
nation
where
such
insult
upon
religion
and
morality
can
be
commit
with
impunity
!
<EOS>
no
man
be
fonder
of
true
wit

humour
than
myself

but
to
profane
sacred
thing
with
jest
and
scoffing
be
a
sure
sign
of
a
weak
and
a
wicked
mind

<EOS>
It
be
the
very
vice
which
Homer
attack
in

odious
character

the

begin

suspend
from

it
fall
afterwards
upon
the
poor
serjeant

learn

one
maxim

mischief

effectually
deaden
its
force

a
woolpack

the

therefore
bear
all
with
patience

the
idea
of
a
woolpack

perhaps
,
bring
that
of
a
feather
-
bed
into
his
head

he
at

quiet
his

I
be
aware

the
esteem

some

before
have

may
be
here
lessen

may
appear
to
have
be

easy
a
dupe

the
gross
flattery
of
the
old

if
there
be
any
such
critic
,
we
be
heartily
sorry

as
well
for
them
as
for
the
doctor

it
be
our
business
to
discharge
the
part
of
a
faithful
historian

to
describe
human
nature

not

"
cry
the
colonel
,
"
your
question
deserve
no
answer
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
take
time
to
consider
whether
I
ought
not
to
resent
the
supposition
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
,
sir
,
I
be
acquaint
with
a
rascal
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
,
colonel
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
that
you
would
willingly
cultivate
an
intimacy
with
such
a
person
;
but
a
man
must
have
good
luck
who
hath
any
acquaintance
if
there
be
not
some
rascal
among
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
offend
with
you
,
child
,
"
say
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
not
intend
to
offend
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
man
,
I
believe
,
dare
intend
it
,
"
say
Booth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
too
,
"
say
the
colonel
;
<EOS>
"
d####n
me
<EOS>
,
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
but
you
know
,
child
,
how
tender
I
be
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
ever
marry
myself
,
I
should
have
cleave
the
man
's
skull
who
have
dare
look
wantonly
at
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
certainly
the
most
cruel
of
all
injury
,
"
say
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
how
finely
doth
Shakespeare
express
it
in
his
Othello
!
      
<EOS>
"
but
there
,
where
I
have
treasure
up
my
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
that
Shakespeare
,
"
cry
the
colonel
,
"
be
a
fine
fellow
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
pretty
poet
indeed
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
shakespeare
that
write
the
play
about
Hotspur
?
<EOS>
You
must
remember
these
line
.
<EOS>
I
get
them
almost
by
heart
at
the
playhouse
;
for
I
never
miss
that
play
whenever
it
be
act
,
if
I
be
in
town
:
         
<EOS>
by
<EOS>
Heav'n
it
be
an
easy
leap
,
     
to
pluck
bright
honour
into
the
full
moon
,
     
or
drive
into
the
bottomless
deep
.
  
<EOS>
and
 
and
 
faith
,
I
have
almost
forget
them
;
but
I
know
it
be
something
about
save
your
honour
from
drown
 
o
!
<EOS>
it
be
very
fine
!
<EOS>
I
say
,
 
d####n
me
,
the
man
that
writ
those
line
be
the
great
poet
the
world
ever
produce

<EOS>
there
be
dignity
of
expression
and
emphasis
of

me

"
  
<EOS>
Booth
assent
to
the
colonel
's
criticism
,
and
then
cry
,
"
I
wish
,
colonel
,
you
would
be
so
kind
to
give
me
that
letter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
colonel
answer
,
if
he
have
any
particular
use
for
it
he
would
give
it
him
with
all
his
heart
,
and
presently
deliver
it
;
and
soon
afterwards
they
part
.
  
<EOS>
several
passage
now
strike
all
at
once
upon
Booth
's
mind
,
which
give
him
great
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
He
become
confident
now
that
he
have
mistake
one
colonel
for
another
;
and
,
though
he
could
not
account
for
the
letter
's
get
into
those
hand
from
whom
Bath
have
take
it
(
indeed
James
have
dropt
it
out
of
his
pocket
)
,
yet
a
thousand
circumstance
leave
him
no
room
to
doubt
the
identity
of
the
person
,
who
be
a
man
much
more
liable
to
raise
the
suspicion
of
a
husband
than
honest
Bath
,
who
would
at
any
time
have
rather
fight
with
a
man
than
lain
with
a
woman
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
behaviour
of
Amelia
now
rush
upon
his
memory
.
<EOS>
Her
resolution
not
to
take
up
her
residence
at
the
colonel
's
house
,
her
backwardness
even
to
dine
there
,
her
unwillingness
to
go
to
the
masquerade
,
many
of
her
unguarded
expression
,
and
some
where
she
have
be
more
guard
,
all
join
together
to
raise
such
an
idea
in
Mr.
Booth
,
that
he
have
almost
take
a
resolution
to
go
and
cut
the
colonel
to
piece
in
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
Cooler
thought
,
however
,
suggest
themselves
to
him
in
time
.
<EOS>
He
recollect
the
promise
he
have
so
solemnly
make
to
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
He
consider
,
moreover
,
that
he
be
yet
in
the
dark
as
to
the
extent
of
the
colonel
's
guilt
.
<EOS>
have
nothing
,
therefore
,
to
fear
from
it
,
he
content
himself
to
postpone
a
resentment
which
he
nevertheless
resolve
to
take
of
the
colonel
hereafter
,
if
he
find
he
be
in
any
degree
a
delinquent
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
step
he
determine
to
take
be
,
on
the
first
opportunity
,
to
relate
to
Colonel
James
the
mean
by
which
he
become
possess
of
the
letter
,
and
to
read
it
to
him
;
<EOS>
on
which
occasion
,
he
think
he
should
easily
discern
by
the
behaviour
of
the
colonel
whether
he
have
be
suspect
either
by
Amelia
or
the
doctor
without
a
cause
;
but
as
for
his
wife
,
he
fully
resolve
not
to
reveal
the
secret
to
her
till
the
doctor
's
return
.
  
<EOS>
while
Booth
be
deeply
engage
by
himself
in
these
meditation
,
Captain
Trent
come
up
to
him
,
and
familiarly
slap
him
on
the
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
soon
join
by
a
third
gentleman
,
and
presently
afterwards
by
a
fourth
,
both
acquaintance
of
Mr.
Trent
;
and
all
have
walk
twice
the
length
of
the
Mall
together
,
it
be
now
past
nine
in
the
evening
,
Trent
propose
go
to
the
tavern
,
to
which
the
stranger
immediately
consent
;
and
Booth
himself
,
after
some
resistance
,
be
at
length
persuade
to
comply
.
  
<EOS>
to
the
King
's
arm
then
they
go
,
where
the
bottle
go
very
briskly
round
till
after
eleven
;
at
which
time
Trent
propose
a
game
at
card
,
to
which
proposal
likewise
Booth
's
consent
be
obtain
,
though
not
without
much
difficulty
;
for
,
though
he
have
naturally
some
inclination
to
gaming
,
and
have
formerly
a
little
indulge
it
,
yet
he
have
entirely
leave
it
off
for
many
year
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
and
his
friend
be
partner
,
and
have
at
first
some
success
;
but
Fortune
,
accord
to
her
usual
conduct
,
soon
shift
about
,
and
persecute
Booth
with
such
malice
,
that
in
about
two
hour
he
be
strip
of
all
the
gold
in
his
pocket
,
which
amount
to
twelve
guinea
,
be
more
than
half
the
cash
which
he
be
at
that
time
worth
.
  
<EOS>
how
easy
it
be
for
a
man
who
be
at
all
taint
with
the
itch
of
gaming
to
leave
off
play
in
such
a
situation
,
especially
when
he
be
likewise
heat
with
liquor
,
I
leave
to
the
gamester
to
determine
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
Booth
have
no
inclination
to
desist
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
be
so
eagerly
bent
on
play
on
,
that
he
call
his
friend
out
of
the
room
,
and
ask
him
for
ten
piece
,
which
he
promise
punctually
to
pay
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
trent
chid
him
for
use
so
much
formality
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
say
he
,
"
dear
Booth
,
you
may
have
what
money
you
please
of
me
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
twenty
-
pound
note
at
your
service
;
and
,
if
you
want
five
time
the
sum
,
it
be
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
We
will
never
let
these
fellow
go
away
with
our
money
in
this
manner
;
for
we
have
so
much
the
advantage
,
that
if
the
know
one
be
here
they
would
lay
odd
of
our
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
if
this
be
really
Mr.
rent
's
opinion
,
he
be
very
much
mistaken
;
for
the
other
two
honourable
gentleman
be
not
only
great
master
of
the
game
,
and
somewhat
soberer
than
poor
Booth
,
have
,
with
all
the
art
in
their
power
,
evade
the
bottle
,
but
they
have
,
moreover
,
another
small
advantage
over
their
adversary
,
both
of
them
,
by
mean
of
some
certain
private
sign
,
previously
agree
upon
between
them
,
be
always
acquaint
with
the
principal
card
in
each
other
's
hand
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
wonder
,
therefore
,
that
Fortune
be
on
their
side
;
for
,
however
she
may
be
report
to
favour
fool
,
she
never
,
I
believe
,
shew
them
any
countenance
when
they
engage
in
play
with
knave
.
  
<EOS>
the
more
Booth
lose
,
the
deep
he
make
his
bet
;
the
consequence
of
which
be
,
that
about
two
in
the
morning
,
besides
the
loss
of
his
own
money
,
he
be
fifty
pound
indebte
to
Trent
:
a
sum
,
indeed
,
which
he
would
not
have
borrow
,
have
not
the
other
,
like
a
very
generous
friend
,
push
it
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
trent
's
pocket
become
at
last
dry
by
mean
of
these
loan
.
<EOS>
His
own
loss
,
indeed
,
be
trifle
;
for
the
stake
of
the
game
be
no
high
than
crown
,
and
bet
(
as
it
be
call
)
<EOS>
be
that
to
which
Booth
owe
his
ruin
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
therefore
,
pretty
well
know
Booth
's
circumstance
,
and
be
kindly
unwilling
to
win
more
of
a
man
than
he
be
worth
,
decline
play
any
longer
,
nor
do
Booth
once
ask
them
to
persist
,
for
he
be
ashamed
of
the
debt
which
he
have
already
contract
to
Trent
,
and
very
far
from
desire
to
encrease
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
then
separate
.
<EOS>
the
two
victor
and
trent
go
off
in
their
chair
to
their
several
house
near
Grosvenor
-
square
,
and
poor
Booth
,
in
a
melancholy
mood
,
walk
home
to
his
lodging
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
in
such
a
fit
of
despair
,
that
it
more
than
once
come
into
his
head
to
put
an
end
to
his
miserable
being
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
we
introduce
him
to
Amelia
we
must
do
her
the
justice
to
relate
the
manner
in
which
she
spend
this
unhappy
evening
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
seven
when
Booth
leave
her
to
walk
in
the
park
;
from
this
time
till
past
eight
she
be
employ
with
her
child
,
in
play
with
them
,
in
give
them
their
supper
,
and
in
put
them
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
when
these
office
be
perform
she
employ
herself
another
hour
in
cook
up
a
little
supper
for
her
husband
,
this
being
,
as
we
have
already
observe
,
his
favourite
meal
,
<EOS>
as
indeed
it
be
her
's
;
and
,
in
a
most
pleasant
and
delightful
manner
,
they
generally
pass
their
time
at
this
season
,
though
their
fare
be
very
seldom
of
the
sumptuous
kind
.
  
<EOS>
It
now
grow
dark
,
and
her
hashed
mutton
be
ready
for
the
table
,
but
no
Booth
appear
.
<EOS>
have
wait
therefore
for
him
a
full
hour
,
she
give
him
over
for
that
evening
;
nor
be
she
much
alarm
at
his
absence
,
as
she
know
he
be
in
a
night
or
two
to
be
at
the
tavern
with
some
brother
-
officer
;
she
conclude
therefore
that
they
have
meet
in
the
park
,
and
have
agree
to
spend
this
evening
together
.
  
<EOS>
at
ten
then
she
sit
down
to
supper
by
herself
,
for
Mrs.
Atkinson
be
then
abroad
.
<EOS>
and
here
we
can
not
help
relate
a
little
incident
,
however
trivial
it
may
appear
to
some
.
<EOS>
have
sit
some
time
alone
,
reflect
on
their
distressed
situation
,
her
spirit
grow
very
low
;
and
she
be
once
or
twice
go
to
ring
the
bell
to
send
her
maid
for
half
-
a
-
pint
of
white
wine
,
but
check
her
inclination
in
order
to
save
the
little
sum
of
sixpence
,
which
she
do
the
more
resolutely
as
she
have
before
refuse
to
gratify
her
child
with
tart
for
their
supper
from
the
same
motive
.
<EOS>
and
this
self
-
denial
she
be
very
probably
practise
to
save
sixpence
,
while
her
husband
be
pay
a
debt
of
several
guinea
incur
by
the
ace
of
trump
be
in
the
hand
of
his
adversary
.
  
<EOS>
instead
therefore
of
this
cordial
she
take
up
one
of
the
excellent
Farquhar
's
comedy
,
and
read
it
half
through
;
when
,
the
clock
striking
twelve
,
she
retire
to
bed
,
leave
the
maid
to
sit
up
for
her
master
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
indeed
,
have
much
more
willingly
sit
up
herself
,
but
the
delicacy
of
her
own
mind
assure
her
that
Booth
would
not
thank
her
for
the
compliment
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
indeed
,
a
method
which
some
wife
take
of
upbraid
their
husband
for
stay
abroad
till
too
late
an
hour
,
and
of
engage
them
,
through
tenderness
and
good
nature
,
never
to
enjoy
the
company
of
their
friend
too
long
when
they
must
do
this
at
the
expence
of
their
wife
'
rest
.
  
<EOS>
to
bed
then
she
go
,
but
not
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
thrice
<EOS>
indeed
she
tell
the
dismal
clock
,
and
as
often
hear
the
more
dismal
watchman
,
till
her
miserable
husband
find
his
way
home
,
and
steal
silently
like
a
thief
to
bed
to
her
;
at
which
time
,
pretend
then
first
to
awake
,
she
throw
her
snowy
arm
around
him
;
though
,
perhaps
,
the
more
witty
property
of
snow
,
accord
to
Addison
,
that
be
to
say
its
coldness
,
rather
belong
to
the
poor
captain
.
    
<EOS>
Read
,
gamester
,
and
observe
.
 
<EOS>
Booth
could
not
so
well
disguise
the
agitation
of
his
mind
from
Amelia
,
but
that
she
perceive
sufficient
symptom
to
assure
her
that
some
misfortune
have
befall
him
.
<EOS>
this
make
her
in
her
turn
so
uneasy
that
Booth
take
notice
of
it
,
and
after
breakfast
say
,
"
sure
,
my
dear
Emily
,
something
hath
fall
out
to
vex
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
look
tenderly
at
him
,
answer
,
"
indeed
,
my
dear
,
you
be
in
the
right
;
I
be
indeed
extremely
vexed
.
"
<EOS>
"
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
"
say
he
,
"
what
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
love
,
"
cry
she
,
"
that
you
must
answer
yourself
.
<EOS>
whatever
it
be
which
hath
give
you
all
that
disturbance
<EOS>
that
<EOS>
you
in
vain
endeavour
to
conceal
from
me
,
this
it
be
which
cause
all
my
affliction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
guess
truly
,
my
sweet
,
"
reply
Booth
;
"
I
be
indeed
afflict
,
and
I
will
not
,
nay
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
conceal
the
truth
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
undo
myself
,
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
you
do
,
child
?
"
say
she
,
in
some
consternation
;
"
pray
,
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
lose

herself
 
<EOS>
"
what
signify
the
trifle
you
have
in
your
pocket

<EOS>
resolve
never
to
play
again

and
let
it
give
you
no
further
vexation

I
warrant
you

we
will
contrive
some
method

repair
such
a
loss

"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
heavenly
angel
!

thou
comfort
of
my
soul

<EOS>
cry
Booth
,
tenderly
embrace
her
;
then
start
a
little
from
her
arm
,
and
look
with
eager
fondness
in
her
eye
,
he
say
,
"
let
me
survey
thee
;
art
thou
really
human
,

art
thou
not
rather
an
angel
in

human
form

,
no

he

fly
again
into

Amelia
,
have
return
all
his
caress
with
equal
kindness
,
tell
him
she
have
near
eleven
guinea
in
her
purse
,

ask
how
much
she
should
fetch
him

<EOS>
"
I
would
not
advise
you
,
Billy
,
to
carry
too
much
in
your
pocket

for
fear
it
should
be
a
temptation
to
you
to
return
to
gaming
,

to
retrieve
your
past
loss

let
me
beg
you
,
on
all
account
,
never
to
think
more
,
if
possible
,
on
the
trifle
you
have
lose
,
anymore

never
possess
it

"
  
<EOS>
Booth
promise
her
faithfully
he
never
would
,
and
refuse
to
take
any
of
the
money
.
<EOS>
He
then
hesitate
a
moment
,
and
cry
 
<EOS>
"
You
say
,
my
dear
,
you
have
eleven
guinea
;
you
have
a
diamond
ring
,
likewise
,
which
be
your
grandmother
's
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
be
worth
twenty
pound
;
and
your
own
and
the
child
's
watch
be
worth
as
much
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
they
would
sell
for
as
much
,
"
cry
Amelia
;
"
for
a
pawnbroker
of
Mrs.
Atkinson
's
acquaintance
offer
to
lend
me
thirty
-
five
pound
upon
them
when
you
be
in
your
last
distress
.
<EOS>
but
why
be
you
compute
their
value
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
only
consider
,
"
answer
he
,
"
how
much
we
could
raise
in
any
case
of
exigency
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
compute
it
myself
,
"
say
she
;
"
and
I
believe
all
we
have
in
the
world
,
besides
our
bare
necessary
apparel
,
would
produce
about
sixty
pound
:
and
suppose
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
while
we
have
that
little
sum
,
we
should
think
of
employ
it
some
way
or
other
,
to
procure
some
small
subsistence
for
ourselves
and
our
family
.
<EOS>
as
for
your
dependence
on
the
colonel
's
friendship
,
it
be
all
vain
,
I
be
afraid
,
and
fallacious
.
<EOS>
nor
do
I
see
any
hope
you
have
from
any
other
quarter
,
of
provide
for
yourself
again
in
the
army
.
<EOS>
and
though
the
sum
which
be
now
in
our
power
be
very
small
,
yet
we
may
possibly
contrive
with
it
to
put
ourselves
into
some
mean
way
of
livelihood
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
heart
,
my
Billy
,
which
be
capable
of
undergo
anything
for
your
sake
;
and
I
hope
my
hand
be
as
able
to
work
as
those
which
have
be
more
inure
to
it
.
<EOS>
but
think
,
my
dear
,
think
what
must
be
our
wretched
condition
,
when
the
very
little
we
now
have
be
all
moulder
away
,
as
it
will
soon
be
in
this
town
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
poor
Booth
hear
this
,
and
reflect
that
the
time
which
Amelia
foresaw
be
already
arrive
(
for
that
he
have
already
lose
every
farthing

be
worth

pale

his

out

Damnation

Amelia
be
throw
into
the

consternation
by
this
behaviour
;

,
with
great
terror
in

countenance

cry
out

I

really
afraid

of
go
too
far

<EOS>
I
know
the
obligation
you
have

him

if
I
suspect
that
he
act
rather
from
vanity
than
true
friendship
"
  
"
vanity
!
"
<EOS>
cry
he
;
"
take
care
,
Amelia
:
you
know
his
motive

be
much
bad

vanity
 
<EOS>
a
motive

,
if

pile
obligation
on
me

they
have
reach

would
tumble
all
down

on

out

"
be
not
Amelia

then
,

cry
he

equally
jealous

Would
she

from
a
weak
tenderness

go
privately
about
to
betray
,
to
undermine
the
most
invaluable
treasure

<EOS>
Would
she
have
me
point
at
as
the
credulous
dupe
,
the
easy
fool
,
the
tame
,
the
kind
cuckold
,
of
a
rascal
with
whom
I
converse
as
a
friend

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
injure
me

say
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
have
the
trial
!
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
could
sacrifice
all
I
hold
most
dear
to
preserve
your
honour
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
shew
I
can
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
 
when
you
be
cool
,
I
will
 
satisfy
you
I
have
do
nothing
you
ought
to
blame

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
cool
then
,
"
cry
he
;
<EOS>
"
I
will
with
the
great
coolness
hear
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
do
not
think
,
Amelia
,
I
have
the
least
jealousy
,
the
least
suspicion
,
the
least
doubt
of
your
honour
.
<EOS>
It
be
your
want
of
confidence
in
me
alone
which
I
blame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
be
calm
,
"
cry
she
,
"
I
will
speak
,
and
not
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
assure
her
he
be
calm
;
and
then
she
say
,
"
You
have
justify
my
conduct
by
your
present
passion
,
in
conceal
from
you
my
suspicion
;
for
they
be
no
more
,
nay
,
it
be
possible
they
be
unjust
;
for
since
the
doctor
,
in
betray
the
secret
to
you
,
hath
so
far
falsify
my
opinion
of
him
,
why
may
I
not
be
as
well
deceive
in
my
opinion
of
the
colonel
,
since
it
be
only
form
on
some
particular
in
his
behaviour
which
I
dislike
?
<EOS>
for
,
upon
my
honour
,
he
never
speak
a
word
to
me
,
nor
hath
be
ever
guilty
of
any
direct
action
,
which
I
could
blame
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
go
on
,
and
relate
most
of
the
circumstance
which
she
have
mention
to
the
doctor
,
omit
one
or
two
of
the
strong
,
and
give
such
a
turn
to
the
rest
,
that
,
if
Booth
have
not
have
some
of
Othello
's
blood
in
him
,
his
wife
would
have
almost
appear
a
prude
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
even
he
,
however
,
be
pretty
well
pacify
by
this
narrative
,
and
say
he
be
glad
to
find
a
possibility
of
the
colonel
's
innocence
;
but
that
he
greatly
commend
the
prudence
of
his
wife
,
and
only
wish
she
would
for
the
future
make
him
her
only
confidant
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
upon
that
,
express
some
bitterness
against
the
doctor
for
break
his
trust
;
when
Booth
,
in
his
excuse
,
relate
all
the
circumstance
of
the
letter
,
and
plainly
convince
her
that
the
secret
have
dropt
by
mere
accident
from
the
mouth
of
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
thus
the
husband
and
wife
become
again
reconcile
,
and
poor
Amelia
generously
forgave
a
passion
of
which
the
sagacious
reader
be
better
acquaint
with
the
real
cause
than
be
that
unhappy
lady
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Booth
receive
a
visit
from
Captain
Trent
.
 
<EOS>
when
Booth
grow
perfectly
cool
,
and
begin
to
reflect
that
he
have
break
his
word
to
the
doctor
,
in
have
make
the
discovery
to
his
wife
which
we
have
see
in
the
last
chapter
,
that
thought
give
him
great
uneasiness
;
and
now
,
to
comfort
him
,
Captain
Trent
come
to
make
him
a
visit
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
,
indeed
,
almost
the
last
man
in
the
world
whose
company
he
wish
for
;
for
he
be
the
only
man
he
be
ashamed
to
see
,
for
a
reason
well
known
to
gamester
;
among
whom
,
the
most
dishonourable
of
all
thing
be
not
to
pay
a
debt
,
contract
at
the
gaming
-
table
,
the
next
day
,
or
the
next
time
at
least
that
you
see
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
make
no
doubt
but
that
Trent
be
come
on
purpose
to
receive
this
debt
;
the
latter
have
be
therefore
scarce
a
minute
in
the
room
before
Booth
begin
,
in
an
aukward
manner
,
to
apologise
;
but
Trent
immediately
stopt
his
mouth
,
and
say
,
"
I
do
not
want
the
money
,
Mr.
Booth
,
and
you
may
pay
it
me
whenever
you
be
able
;
and
,
if
you
be
never
able
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
I
will
never
ask
you
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
generosity
raise
such
a
temp
of
gratitude
in
Booth
(
if
I
may
be
allow
the
expression
)
,
that
the
tear
burst
from
his
eye
,
and
it
be
some
time
before
he
could
find
any
utterance
for
those
sentiment
with
which
his
mind
overflow
;
but
,
when
he
begin
to
express
his
thankfulness
,
trent
immediately
stopt
him
,
and
give
a
sudden
turn
to
their
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Trent
have
be
to
visit
Mrs.
Booth
on
the
masquerade
evening
,
which
visit
Mrs.
Booth
have
not
yet
return
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
this
be
only
the
second
day
since
she
have
receive
it
.
<EOS>
trent
therefore
now
tell
his
friend
that
he
should
take
it
extremely
kind
if
he
and
his
lady
would
waive
all
ceremony
,
and
sup
at
their
house
the
next
evening
.
<EOS>
Booth
hesitate
a
moment
,
but
presently
say
,
"
I
be
pretty
certain
<EOS>
my
wife
be
not
engage
,
and
I
will
undertake
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
will
not
refuse
anything
Mr.
Trent
can
ask
.
"
<EOS>
and
soon
after
Trent
take
Booth
with
him
to
walk
in
the
Park
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
few
great
lover
of
a
bottle
than
trent
;
he
soon
propose
therefore
to
adjourn
to
the
King
's
arm
tavern
,
where
Booth
,
though
much
against
his
inclination
,
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
but
Trent
be
very
importunate
,
and
Booth
do
not
think
himself
at
liberty
to
refuse
such
a
request
to
a
man
from
whom
he
have
so
lately
receive
such
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
the
tavern
,
however
,
Booth
recollect
the
omission
he
have
be
guilty
of
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
He
write
a
short
note
therefore
to
his
wife
,
acquaint
her
that
he
should
not
come
home
to
supper
;
but
comfort
her
with
a
faithful
promise
that
he
would
on
no
account
engage
himself
in
gaming
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
bottle
pass
in
ordinary
conversation
;
but
,
when
they
have
tap
the
second
,
Booth
,
on
some
hint
which
Trent
give
him
,
very
fairly
lay
open
to
him
his
whole
circumstance
,
and
declare
he
almost
despair
of
mend
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
chief
relief
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
in
the
interest
of
Colonel
James
;
but
I
have
give
up
those
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
very
wisely
too
,
"
say
Trent
"
I
say
nothing
of
the
colonel
's
good
will
.
<EOS>
very
likely
he
may
be
your
sincere
friend
;
but
I
do
not
believe
he
hath
the
interest
he
pretend
to
.
<EOS>
He
hath
have
too
many
favour
in
his
own
family
to
ask
any
more
yet
a
while
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
mistaken
if
you
have
not
a
much
more
powerful
friend
than
the
colonel
;
one
who
be
both
able
and
willing
to
serve
you
.
<EOS>
I
dine
at

"
MADAM
,
 
the
quick
despatch
which
I
have
give
to
your
first
command
<EOS>
will
I
hope
assure
you
of
the
diligence
with
which
I
shall
always
obey
every
command
that
you
be
pleased
to
honour
me
with
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
indeed
,
in
this
trifling
affair
,
act
as
if
my
life
itself
have
be
at
stake
;
<EOS>
nay
,
I
know
not
<EOS>

it
may
be
so
;
for
this
insignificant
matter
,
you
be
pleased
to
tell
me
,
would
oblige
the
charming
person
in
whose
power
be
not
only
my
happiness
,
but
,
as
I
be
well
persuaded
,
my
life
too
.
<EOS>
let
me
reap
therefore
some
little
advantage
in
your
eye
,
as
you
have
in
mine
,
from
this
trifle
occasion
;
for
,
if
anything
could
add
to
the
charm
of
which
you
be
mistress
,
it
would
be
perhaps
that
amiable
zeal
with
which
you
maintain
the
cause
of
your
friend
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
indeed
,
she
will
be
my
friend
and
advocate
with
the
most
lovely
of
her
sex
,
as
I
think
she
hath
reason
,
and
as
you
be
pleased
to
insinuate
she
have
be
.
<EOS>
let
me
beseech
you
,
madam
,
let
not
that
dear
heart
,
whose
tenderness
be
so
inclined
to
compassionate
the
misery
of
other
,
be
harden
only
against
the
suffering
which
itself
occasion
.
<EOS>
let
not
that
man
alone
have
reason
to
think
you
cruel
,
who
,
of
all
other
,
would
do
the
most
to
procure
your
kindness
.
<EOS>
how
often
have
I
live
over
in
my
reflection
,
in
my
dream
,
those
two
short
minute
we
be
together
!

,
alas
!
<EOS>
how
faint
be
these
mimicry
of
the
imagination

would
I
not
give
to
purchase
the
reality
of
such
another
blessing

be
in
your
power

bestow
on
the
man

hath
no
wish
,
no
will
,
no
fortune
,
no
heart
,
no
life

what
be
at
your
disposal

me
only
the
favour
to
be
at
Lady

assembly

can
have
nothing
to
fear
from
indulge
me
with
a
moment
's
sight

a
moment
's
conversation
;
I
will
ask
no
more

I
know
your
delicacy
,

have
rather
die
than
offend
it

<EOS>
Could
I
have
see
you
sometimes
<EOS>
,
I
believe
the
fear
of
offend
you
would
have
keep
my
love
for
ever
bury
in
my
own
bosom
;
but
,
to
be
totally
exclude
even
from
the
sight
of
what
my
soul
doat
on

what
I
can
not
bear

<EOS>
It
be
that
alone
which
hath
extort
the
fatal
secret
from
me

<EOS>
let
that
obtain
your
forgiveness
for
me

<EOS>
I
need
not
sign
this
letter
otherwise
than
with
that
impression
of
my
heart
which
I
hope
it
bear
;
and
,
to
conclude
it
in
any
form
,
no
language
hath
word
of
devotion
strong
enough
to
tell
you
with
what
truth

what
anguish

what
zeal

what
adoration
I
love
you

this
parchment

dropt
from

<EOS>
however
,
I
know
your
goodness
,
and
I
will
tell
you
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
to
know
then
,
madam
,
that
I
have
not
be
in
the
Opera
-
house
six
minute
before
a
masque
come
up
,
and
,
take
me
by
the
hand
,
lead
me
aside
.
<EOS>
I
give
the
masque
my
hand
;
and
,
see
a
lady
at
that
time
lie
hold
on
Captain
Booth
<EOS>
,
I
take
that
opportunity
of
slip
away
from
him
;
for
though
,
by
the
help
of
the
squeak
voice
,
and
by
attempt
to
mimic
your
,
I
have
pretty
well
disguise
my
own
,
I
be
still
afraid
,
if
I
have
much
conversation
with
your
husband
,
he
would
discover
me
.
<EOS>
I
walk
therefore
away
with
this
masque
to
the
upper
end
of
the
farth
room
,
where
we
sit
down
in
a
corner
together
.
<EOS>
He
presently
discover
to
me
that
he
take
me
for
you
,
and
I
soon
after
find
out
who
he
be
;
indeed
,
so
far
from
attempt
to
disguise
himself
,
he
speak
in
his
own
voice
and
in
his
own
person
.
<EOS>
He
now
begin
to
make
very
violent
love
to
me
,
but
it
be
rather
in
the
stile
of
a
great
man
of
the
present
age
than
of
an
arcadian
swain
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
lay
his
whole
fortune
at
my
foot
,
and
bade
me
<EOS>
make
whatever
term
I
please
,
either
for
myself
or
for
other
.
<EOS>
by
other
,
I
suppose
he
mean
your
husband
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
put
a
thought
into
my
head
of
turn
the
present
occasion
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
there
be
two
kind
of
person
,
the
fallaciousness
of
whose
promise
have
become
proverbial
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
these
be
lover
,
and
great
man
.
<EOS>
what
reliance
,
then
,
could
I
have
on
the
promise
of
one
who
unite
in
himself
both
those
character
?
<EOS>
that
I
have
see
a
melancholy
instance
,
in
a
very
worthy
woman
of
my
acquaintance
(
mean
myself
,
madam
)
,
of
his
want
of
generosity
.
<EOS>
I
say
I
know
the
obligation
that
he
have
to
this
woman
,
and
the
injury
he
have
do
her
,
all
which
I
be
convince
she
forgive
,
for
that
she
have
say
the
handsome
thing
in
the
world
of
him
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
answer
that
he
think
he
have
not
be
deficient
in
generosity
to
this
lady
(
for
I
explain
to
him
whom
I
mean
)
;
but
that
indeed
,
if
she
have
speak
well
of
him
to
me
(
mean
yourself
,
madam
)
,
he
would
not
fail
to
reward
her
for
such
an
obligation
.
<EOS>
I
then
tell
him
she
have
marry
a
very
deserving
man
,
who
have
serve
long
in
the
army
abroad
as
a
private
man
,
and
who
be
a
serjeant
in
the
guard
;
that
I
know
it
be
so
very
easy
for
him
to
get
him
a
commission
,
that
I
should
not
think
he
have
any
honour
or
goodness
in
the
world
if
he
neglect
it
.
<EOS>
I
declare
this
step
must
be
a
preliminary
to
any
good
opinion
he
must
ever
hope
for
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
then
profess
the
great
friendship
to
that
lady
(
in
which
I
be
convince
you
will
think
me
serious
)
,
and
assure
him
he
would
give
me
one
of
the
high
pleasure
in
let
me
be
the
instrument
of
do
her
such
a
service
.
<EOS>
He
promise
me
in
a
moment
to
do
what
you
see
,
madam
,
he
hath
since
do
.
<EOS>
and
to
you
I
shall
always
think
myself
indebted
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
you
be
indebted
to
me
,
"
cry
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
very
glad
of
any
good
fortune
that
can
attend
poor
Atkinson
,
but
I
wish
it
have
be
obtain
some
other
way
.
<EOS>
good
Heavens
!
<EOS>
what
must
be
the
consequence
of
this
?
<EOS>
what
must
this
lord
think
of
me
for
listen
to
his
mention
of
love
?
<EOS>
nay
,
for
make
any
term
with
him
?
<EOS>
for
what
must
he
suppose
those
term
mean
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
you
carry
it
a
great
deal
too
far
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
he
have
the
assurance
to
write
to
me
in
the
manner
he
hath
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
plain
what
he
conceive
of
me
,
and
who
know
what
he
may
say
to
other
?
<EOS>
You
may
have
blow
up
my
reputation
by
your
behaviour
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
that
possible
?
"
answer
Mrs.
Atkinson
.
<EOS>
"
be
it
not
in
my
power
to
clear
up
all
matter
?
<EOS>
if
you
will
but
give
me
leave
to
make
an
appointment
in
your
name
I
will
meet
him
myself
,
and
declare
the
whole
secret
to
him

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
will
consent
to
no
such
appointment

cry
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
heartily
sorry
I
ever
consent
to
practise
any
deceit

<EOS>
I
plainly
see
the
truth
of
what
Dr
Harrison
hath
often
tell
me
,
that
,
if
one
step
ever
so
little
out
of
the
way

however

all

say
Mrs.

"
you

<EOS>
"
I

answer
Amelia

<EOS>

I

it

a

the

<EOS>

he
,
"
I
have
not

He
be
grow
so
great

he

else
<EOS>
I
do
not

for
his

hundred

he

you

They
then
walk
together
to

where
Booth

from

give
his

<EOS>
double
the
little
sum
he
have
ask

<EOS>
upon

the
old

shake

heartily

whence
he
carry
off
a

<EOS>
when
he
be
go
<EOS>
Amelia
ask
her
husband
who
that
old
gentleman
be
?
<EOS>
Booth
answer
he
be
one
of
the
scandal
of
his
country
;
that
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
have
about
thirty
year
before
make
him
an
ensign
from
a
private
man
for
very
particular
merit
;
and
that
he
have
not
long
since
go
out
of
the
army
with
a
break
heart
,
upon
have
several
boy
put
over
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
then
give
her
an
account
of
his
family
,
which
he
have
hear
from
the
old
gentleman
in
their
way
to
his
house
,
and
with
which
we
have
already
in
a
concise
manner
acquaint
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
Heavens
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Amelia
;
"
what
be
our
great

make
of
?

be
they
in

a

they

"
  
<EOS>
"
one
would
,
indeed

sometimes

"
cry
Booth

"
be
incline
to
think
so

<EOS>
in
truth
,
they
have
no
perfect
idea
of
those
common
distress
of
mankind
which
be
far
remove
from
their

<EOS>
compassion
,
if
thoroughly

will

I

appear
to

the
fellow

feeling
only
of
man
of
the

rank

degree
of
life
for
one
another

on

the
evil
to
which
they
themselves
be
liable

<EOS>
Our
sensation
be
,
I
be
afraid

very
cold
towards
those
who
be
at
a
great
distance
from
us

whose
calamity
can
consequently
never
reach
us

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
a
sentiment
of
Dr
Harrison
's
,
which
he
tell
me
be
in
some
latin
book
;
I
be
a
man
myself
,
and
my
heart
be
interested
in
whatever
can
befal
the
rest
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
sentiment
of
a
good
man
,
and
whoever
think
otherwise
be
a
bad
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
tell
you
,
my
dear
Emily
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
that
all
man
,
as
well
the
good
as
the
bad
,
act
alike
from
the
principle
of
self
-
love
.
<EOS>
where
benevolence
therefore
be
the
uppermost
passion
,
self
-
love
direct
you
to
gratify
it
by
do
good
,
and
by
relieve
the
distress
of
other
;
for
they
be
then
in
reality
your
own
.
<EOS>
but
where
ambition
,
avarice
,
pride
,
or
any
other
passion
,
govern
the
man
and
keep
his
benevolence
down
,
the
misery
of
all
other
man
affect
him
no
more
than
they
would
a
stock
or
a
stone
.
<EOS>
and
thus
the
man
and
his
statue
have
often
the
same
degree
of
feeling
or
compassion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
wish
,
my
dear
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
to
hear
you
converse
with
Dr
Harrison
on
this
subject
;
for
I
be
sure
he
would
convince
you
,
though
I
can
not
,
that
there
be
really
such
thing
as
religion
and
virtue
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
first
hint
of
this
kind
which
Amelia
have
give
;
for
she
sometimes
apprehend
from
his
discourse
that
he
be
little
well
than
an
atheist
:
a
consideration
which
do
not
diminish
her
affection
for
him
,
but
give
her
great
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
on
all
such
occasion
Booth
immediately
turn
the
discourse
to
some
other
subject
;
for
,
though
he
have
in
other
point
a
great
opinion
of
his
wife
's
capacity
,
yet
as
a
divine
or
a
philosopher
he
do
not
hold
her
in
a
very
respectable
light
,
nor
do
he
lay
any
great
stress
on
her
sentiment
in
such
matter
.
<EOS>
He
now
,
therefore
,
give
a
speedy
turn
to
the
conversation
,
and
begin
to
talk
of
affair
below
the
dignity
of
this
history
.
    
<EOS>
BOOK
XL
.
 
<EOS>
contain
a
very
polite
scene
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
now
look
back
to
some
personage
who
,
though
not
the
principal
character
in
this
history
,
have
yet
make
too
considerable
a
figure
in
it
to
be
abruptly
dropt
:
and
these
be
Colonel
James
and
his
lady
.
  
<EOS>
this
fond
couple
never
meet
till
dinner
the
day
after
the
masquerade
,
when
they
happen
to
be
alone
together
in
an
antechamber
before
the
arrival
of
the
rest
of
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
begin
with
the
colonel

say
,
"
I
hope
,
madam
,
you
get
no
cold
last
night
at
the
masquerade
.
<EOS>
"
to
which
the
lady
answer
by
much
the
same
kind
of
question
.
  
<EOS>
They
then
sit
together
near
five
minute
without
open
their
mouth
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
at
last
Mrs.
James
say
,
"
pray
,
sir
,
who
be
that
masque
with
you
in
the
dress
of
a
shepherdess

<EOS>
how
could
you
expose
yourself
by
walk
with
such
a
trollop
in
public
;
for
certainly
no
woman
of
any
figure
would
appear
there
in
such
a
dress
?
<EOS>
You
know
,
Mr.
James
,
I
never
interfere
with
your
affair
;
but
I
would
,
methink
,
for
my
own

,
if
I
be
you

preserve
a
little
decency
in
the
face

"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
"
say
James
,
"
I
do
not
know
whom
you
mean

<EOS>
a
woman
in
such
a

speak

aught
I
know

a

I
promise

I
speak

no

acquaintance
there

I
know

<EOS>
indeed
,
I
now
recollect
there
be
a
woman
in
a
dress
of
a
shepherdess
;
and
there
be
another
aukward
thing
in
a
blue
domino
that
plague
me
a
little
,

I
soon
get
rid
of
them

and
I
suppose
you
do
not
know
the
lady
in

blue
domino
neither

<EOS>
"
not
I
<EOS>

I
assure
you

say
James
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
pray
,
why
do
you
ask
me
these
question
?
<EOS>
it
look
so
like
jealousy

<EOS>
"
jealousy

she
;
<EOS>
"

I
shall
never

I
promise
you

she
despise
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
heartily
glad
of
it
,
"
say
James
;
"
for
I
never
see
such
a
tall
aukward
monster
in
my
life

<EOS>

that
be
a

"
You

say
James
;

you

It
be
not
so
unusual

I

you
yourself
know

to
change
dress

I
own
<EOS>
I
do
it

discover
some
of

James

"
I
do
not

who
the
shepherdess

by

"

she

"
she
tell
me
so
,
and
I
be
convinced
she
tell
me
truth
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
wonder
at
you
deny
it
;
for
that
be
equally
consistent
with
honour
as
to
behave
in
such
a
manner
to
a
wife
who
be
a
gentlewoman
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
allow
me
that
,
sir

because
I
have
not
quite
so
great
a
fortune

I
hope
you
do
not

me
beneath
you

that
you
do
me
any
honour
in

me

<EOS>
I
be
come
of
as
good
a

as
yourself

Mr.
James

if
my

know
how
you
treat
me
he
would
not
bear
it

<EOS>
"
do
you
threaten
me

I

she

I
neither

I

have
my

Mr.

why
will
you
be
so
barbarous
to

the

I

I

upon

sure

not
Mrs.

be
she
not
the
fine
woman
in

world

"
  
<EOS>
"
very
far
from
it
,
"

she
,
"
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pray
what
fault
,
"
say
he
,
"
can
you
find
in
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
first
place
,
"
cry
Mrs.
James
,
"
her
eye
be
too
large
;
and
she
hath
a
look
with
them
that
I
do
not
know
how
to
describe
;
but
<EOS>
I
know
I
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
then
her
eyebrow
be
too
large
;
therefore
,
indeed
,
she
doth
all
in
her
power
to
remedy
this
with
her
pincer
;
for
if
it
be
not
for
those
her
eyebrow
would
be
preposterous
.
<EOS>
then
her
nose
,
as
well
proportion
as
it
be
,
have
a
visible
scar
on
one
side
.
<EOS>
Her
neck
,
likewise
,
be
too
protuberant
for
the
genteel
size
,
especially
as
she
lace
herself
;
for
no
woman
,
in
my
opinion
,
can
be
genteel
who
be
not
entirely
flat
before
.
<EOS>
and
,
lastly
,
she
be
both
too
short
and
too
tall
.
<EOS>
well
,
you
may
laugh
,
Mr.
James
,
I
know
what
I
mean
,
though
I
can
not
well
express
it
:
I
mean
that
she
be
too
tall
for
a
pretty
woman
and
too
short
for
a
fine
woman
.
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
thing
as
a
kind
of
insipid
medium
 
a
kind
of
something
that
be
neither
one
thing
nor
another
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
to
express
it
more
clearly
;
but
when
I
say
such
a
one
be
a
pretty
woman
,
a
pretty
thing
,
a
pretty
creature
,
you
know
<EOS>
very
well
<EOS>
I
mean
a
little
woman
;
<EOS>
and
when
I
say
such
a
one
be
a
very
fine
woman
,
a
very
fine
person
of
a
woman
,
to
be
sure
I
must
mean
a
tall
woman
.
<EOS>
now
a
woman
that
be
between
both
be
certainly
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

I

he
,

you
have
explain
yourself

with
all
these
imperfection

I

<EOS>
"
that
you

the

for
that
I
know
before
you

do
not
I

do
I
make
any
objection

the
party
you

the
masquerade

I
know
very
well
your
motive

<EOS>
what
can
the
good
of
wife
do
more
?
<EOS>
to
procure
you
success
be
not
in
my
power
;
and
,
if
I
may
give
you
my
opinion
,
I
believe
you
will
never
succeed

her
virtue
so
very
impregnable

Her
virtue

Mrs.

hath
the
good
guard
in

a
most
violent
love

all
pretence

affectation

the
colonel

It
be
impossible
she
should
have
so
little
taste

indeed
so
little
delicacy

like
such
a
fellow

"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay

I
do
not

she

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
not
indeed
at
all
such
a
sort
of
man
as
I
should
like
;

I
think
he
have
be
generally
allow
to
be
handsome

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
handsome
!
"
<EOS>

James
.
<EOS>
"
what
,
with
a
nose
like
the
proboscis
of
an
elephant
,
with
the
shoulder
of
a
porter
,
and
the
leg
of
a
chairman
?
<EOS>
the
fellow
hath
not
in
the
least
the
look
of
a
gentleman
,
and
one
would
rather
think
he
have
follow
the
plough
than
the
camp
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
now
I
protest
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
think
you
do
him
injustice
.
<EOS>
He
be
genteel
enough
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
he
be
not
quite
of
the
most
delicate
make
;
but
,
whatever
he
be
,
I
be
convince
she
think
him
the
fine
man
in
the
world

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
believe
it

he
peevishly
;

will
you
invite
her
to
dinner
here
to
-
morrow
?

with
all
my
heart
,

as
often
as
you
please

answer
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
some
favour
to
ask
of
you
.
<EOS>
first
,
I
must
hear
no
more
of
go
out
of
town
till
I
please

"
very
well

he

<EOS>
"
in
the
next
place

I
must
have
two
hundred
guinea
within
these
two
or
three
day

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
agree
to
that
too

he
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
when
I
do
go
out
of
town
,
I
go
to
Tunbridge
 
<EOS>
I
insist
upon
that
;
and
from
Tunbridge
I
go
to
Bath
 
positively
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
and
I
promise
you
faithfully
I
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
carry
Mrs.
Booth
with
me

<EOS>
"
on
that
condition
,
"
answer
he
,
"
I
promise
you
you
shall
go
wherever
you
please
.
<EOS>
and
,
to
shew
you
,
I
will
even
prevent
your
wish
by
my
generosity

as
soon
as
I
receive
the
five
thousand
pound

I

shall
have
two
hundred

She
thank
him
with
a
low
curtesie
;
and
he
be
in
such
good
humour
that
he
offer
to
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
to
this
kiss
she
coldly
turn
her
cheek
,
and
then
,
flirt
her
fan
,
say
,
"
Mr.
James
,
there
be
one
thing
I
forgot
to
mention
to
you
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
intend
to
get
a
commission
in
some
regiment
abroad
for
this
young
man
.
<EOS>
now
if
you
would
take
my
advice
,
I
know
this
will
not
oblige
his
wife
;
and
,
besides
,
I
be
positive
she
resolve
to
go
with
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
can
provide
for
him
in
some
regiment
at
home
,
I
know
she
will
dearly
love
you
for
it
,
and
when
he
be
order
to
quarter
she
will
be
leave
behind
;
and
Yorkshire
or
Scotland
,
I
think
,
be
as
good
a
distance
as
either
of
the
Indies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
will
do
what
I
can
,
"
answer
James
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
ask
anything
yet
;
<EOS>
for
I
get
two
place
of
a
hundred
a
year
each
for
two
of
my
footman
,
within
this
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
instant
a
violent
knock
at
the
door
signify
the
arrival
of
their
company
,
upon
which
both
husband
and
wife
put
on
their
good
look
to
receive
their
guest
;
and
,
from
their
behaviour
to
each
other
during
the
rest
of
the
day
,
a
stranger
may
have
conclude
he
have
be
in
company
with
the
fond
couple
in
the
universe
.
    
<EOS>
matter
political
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
return
to
Booth
we
will
relate
a
scene
in
which
Dr
Harrison
be
concerned
.
  
<EOS>
this
good
man
,
whilst
in
the
country
,
happen
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
nobleman
of
his
acquaintance
,
and
whom
he
know
to
have
very
considerable
interest
with
the
minister
at
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
who
be
very
well
known
to
this
nobleman
,
take
this
opportunity
of
pay
him
a
visit
in
order
to
recommend
poor
Booth
to
his
favour
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
much
doubt
of
his
success
,
the
favour
he
be
to
ask
be
a
very
small
one
,
and
to
which
he
think
the
service
of
Booth
give
him
so
just
a
title
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
's
name
soon
gain
him
an
admission
to
the
presence
of
this
great
man
,
who
,
indeed
,
receive
him
with
much
courtesy
and
politeness
;
not
so
much
,
perhaps
,
from
any
particular
regard
to
the
sacred
function
,
nor
from
any
respect
to
the
doctor
's
personal
merit
,
as
from
some
consideration
which
the
reader
will
perhaps
guess
anon
.
<EOS>
after
many
ceremonial
,
and
some
previous
discourse
on
different
subject
,
the
doctor
open
the
business
,
and
tell
the
great
man
that
he
be
come
to
him
to
solicit
a
favour
for
a
young
gentleman
who
have
be
an
officer
in
the
army
and
be
now
on
half
-
pay
.
<EOS>
"
all
the
favour
I
ask
,
my
lord
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
,
that
this
gentleman
may
be
again
admit
ad
eundem
.
<EOS>
I
be
convince
your
lordship
will
do
me
the
justice
to
think
I
would
not
ask
for
a
worthless
person
;
but
,
indeed
,
the
young
man
<EOS>
I
mean
hath
<EOS>
very
extraordinary
merit
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
the
siege
of
Gibraltar
,
in
which
he
behave
with
distinguished
bravery
,
and
be
dangerously
wound
at
two
several
time
in
the
service
of
his
country
.
<EOS>
I
will
add
that
he
be
at
present
in
great
necessity
,
and
hath
a
wife
and
several
child
,
for
whom
he
hath
no
other
mean
of
provide
;
<EOS>
and
,
if
it
will
recommend
him
farther
to
your
lordship
's
favour
,
his
wife
,
I
believe
,
be
one
of
the
good
and
worthiest
of
all
her
sex
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
that
,
my
dear
doctor
,
"
cry
the
nobleman
,
"
I
shall
make
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
indeed
any
service
I
shall
do
the
gentleman
will
be
upon
your
account
.
<EOS>
as
to
necessity
,
it
be
the
plea
of
so
many
that
it
be
impossible
to
serve
them
all
.
<EOS>
and
with
regard
to
the
personal
merit
of
these
inferior
officer
,
I
believe

You

how
hard
Colonel

I

indeed

why
should
you

it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
for

<EOS>
"
first
,
I
be
an
old
friend

acquaintance
of
Mr.

your

I

very
well

<EOS>
the

therefore
,
that
I

you
may

assure

will
go
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
do
not
concern
myself
deeply
in
these
affair
,
for
I
do
not
think
it
become
my
cloth
so
to
do

<EOS>
but
,
as
far
as
I
think
it
decent
to
interest
myself
,
it
will
certainly
be
on
the
side
of
Mr.
Fairfield
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
should
do
so
if
I
be
acquaint
with
both
the
gentleman
only
by
reputation
;
the
one
be
a
neighbour
gentleman

a
very
sober

sensible
man

of
know
probity

attachment

the
true

the
other
be
a
mere
stranger
,
a
boy
,
a
soldier
of
fortune
,
and
,
as
far
as
I
can
discern
from
the
little
conversation
I
have
have
with
him
,
of
a
very
shallow
capacity

and
no
education

<EOS>

why

he

Europe

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
so
,
my

answer
the

I
shall
always
be
so
great
a
pedant

<EOS>
and
,
from
my

I
can
aver
that
I
be
persuade
there
be
scarce
a
foot

soldier

more

<EOS>
It
be
a
very
low
civil

an
illiterate
man
can
be
qualified

<EOS>
and
,
to
speak
a
plain
truth

if
your

be
a

you
would
do
well

advise
him

all

<EOS>
to

in

you
will
allow
there
be
the

the
season
of
manhood

and
the
season
of
old
age

and
that
,
when
the
last
of
these
arrive

it
will
be
an
impossible
attempt
by

the

restore
the

again
to

the
vigour

the

in

it
rise
by
art

this

then
it
may

enrich
at

all
the

most
you

really
lay
out
of
the
question

be
to

my

opinion

answer
the
peer

"
you
know
I
shall
answer
in
the
negative

you
be
too

acquaint

be
tell
that
the
conduct

politician
be
not
form
upon
the
principle
of
religion

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
for
it
,
"
cry
the
doctor
;
"
but
I
will
talk
to
them
then
of
honour
and
honesty
;
this
be
a
language
which
I
hope
they
will
at
least
pretend
to
understand
.
<EOS>
now
to
deny
a
man
the
preferment
which
he
merit
,
and
to
give
it
to
another
man
who
doth
not
merit
it
,
be
a
manifest
act
of
injustice
,
and
be
consequently
inconsistent
with
both
honour
and
honesty
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
only
an
act
of
injustice
to
the
man
himself
,
but
to
the
public
,
for
whose
good
principally
all
public
office
be
,
or
ought
to
be
,
institute
.
<EOS>
now
this
good
can
never
be
complete
nor
obtain
but
by
employ
all
person
accord
to
their
capacity
.
<EOS>
wherever
true
merit
be
liable
to
be
supersede
by
favour
and
partiality
,
and
man
be
intrust
with
office
without
any
regard
to
capacity
or
integrity
,
the
affair
of
that
state
will
always
be
in
a
deplorable
situation
.
<EOS>
such
,
as
Livy
tell
us
,
be
the
state
of
Capua
a
little
before
its
final
destruction
,
and
the
consequence
your
lordship
well
know
.
<EOS>
but
,
my
lord
,
there
be
another
mischief
which
attend
this
kind
of
injustice
,
and
that
is
,
it
hath
a
manifest
tendency
to
destroy
all
virtue
and
all
ability
among
the
people
,
by
take
away
all
that
encouragement
and
incentive
which
should
promote
emulation

raise
man
to
aim
at
excel
in
any
art
,
science
,
or
profession
.
<EOS>
nor
can
anything
,
my
lord
,
contribute
more
to
render
a
nation
contemptible
among
its
neighbour
;
for
what
opinion
can
other
country
have
of
the
council
,
or
what
terror
can
they
conceive
of
the
arm
,
of
such
a
people
?
<EOS>
and
it
be
chiefly
owe
to
the
avoiding
this
error
that
Oliver
Cromwell
carry
the
reputation
of
England
high
than
it
ever
be
at
any
other
time
.
<EOS>
I
will
add
only
one
argument
more
,
and
that
be
found
on
the
most
narrow
and
selfish
system
of
politic
;
and
this
be
,
that
such
a
conduct
be
sure
to
create
universal
discontent
and
grumble
at
home
;
for
nothing
can
bring
man
to
rest
satisfied
,
when
they
see
other
prefer
to
them
,
but
an
opinion
that
they
deserve
that
elevation
;
for
,
as
one
of
the
great
man
this

ever
produce
observe
,
       
one
worthless
man
that
gain
what
he

disgust
a
thousand
unpretende

<EOS>
with
what
heart
-
burning
then
must
any
nation
see
themselves
oblige
to
contribute
to
the
support
of
a
set
of
man
of
whose
incapacity
to
serve
them
<EOS>
they
be
well
apprize

who
do
their
country
a
double
diskindness
,
by
be
themselves
employ
in

out

do

place

all

I
grant

will

as

he

what

nor
employ
any
civil

military
officer
but
what
be
useful
,
and
place
in
these
employment
man
of
the
high
integrity
,
and
of
the
great
ability
;
if
he
will
employ
some
few
of
his
hour
to
advance
our
trade
,
and
some
few
more
to
regulate
our
domestic
government
;
if
he
would
do
this
,
my
lord

I
will
answer
for
it
,
he
shall
either
have
no
opposition
to
baffle
,
or
he
shall
baffle
it
by
a
fair
appeal
to
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
such
a
minister
may
,
in
the
language
of
the
law
,
put
himself
on
his
country
when
he
please
,
and
he
shall
come
off
with
honour
and
applause
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
do
you
really
believe
,
doctor
,
"
cry
the
peer
,
"
there
ever
be
such
a
minister
,
or
ever
will
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
,
my
lord
?
"
answer
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
It
require
no
very
extraordinary
part
,
nor
any
extraordinary
degree
of
virtue
.
<EOS>
He
need
practise
no
great
instance
of
self
-
denial
.
<EOS>
He
shall
have
power
,
and
honour
,
and
rich
,
and
,
perhaps
,
all
in
a
much
great
degree
than
he
can
ever
acquire
by
pursue
a
contrary
system
.
<EOS>
He
shall
have
more
of
each
and
much
more
of
safety
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
pray
,
doctor
,
"
say
my
lord
,
"
let
me
ask
you
one
simple
question
.
<EOS>
do
you
really
believe
any
man
upon
earth
be
ever
a
rogue
out
of
choice
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
really
,
my
lord
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
I
be
ashamed
to
answer
in
the
affirmative
;
and
yet
I
be
afraid
experience
would
almost
justify
me
if
I
should
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
opinion
of
the
world
may
sometimes
mislead
man
to
think
those
measure
necessary
which
in
reality
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
or
the
truth
may
be
,
that
a
man
of
good
inclination
find
his
office
fill
with
such
corruption
by
the
iniquity
of
his
predecessor
,
that
he
may
despair
of
be
capable
of
purge
it
;
and
so
sit
down
contented
,
as
Augeas
do
with
the
filth
of
his
stable
,
not
because
he
think
them
the
well
,
or
that
such
filth
be
really
necessary
to
a
stable
,
but
that
he
despair
of
sufficient
force
to
cleanse
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
ask
you
one
question
more
,
and
I
have
do
,
"
say
the
nobleman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
imagine
that
if
any
minister
be
really
as
good
as
you
would
have
him
,
that
the
people
in
general
would
believe
that
he
be
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
truly
,
my
lord
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
I
think
they
may
be
justify
in
not
believe
too
hastily
.
<EOS>
but
I
beg
leave
to
answer
your
lordship
's
question
by
another
.
<EOS>
doth
<EOS>
your
lordship
believe
that
the
people
of
Greenland
,
when
they
see
the
light
of
the
sun
and
feel
his
warmth
,
after
so
long
a
season
of
cold
and
darkness
,
will
really
be
persuade
that
he
shine
upon
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
lord
smile
at
the
conceit
;
and
then
the
doctor
take
an
opportunity
to
renew
his
suit
,
to
which
his
lordship
answer
,
"
He
would
promise
nothing
,
and
could
give
him
no
hope
of
success
;
but
you
may
be
assure
,
"
say
he
,
with
a
leer
countenance
,
"
I
shall
do
him
all
the
service
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
language
which
the
doctor
well
understand
;
and
soon
after
take
a
civil
,
but
not
a
very
ceremonious
leave
.
    
<EOS>
the
history
of
Mr.
Trent
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
now
return
to
Mr.
Booth
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
the
former
have
spend
his
time
very
uneasily
ever
since
he
have
discover
what
sort
of
man
he
be
indebte
to
;
but
,
lest
he
should
forget
it
,
Mr.
Trent
think
now
proper
to
remind
him
in
the
following
letter
,
which
he
read
the
next
morning
after
he
have
put
off
the
appointment
.
  
<EOS>
"
SIR
,
 
I
be
sorry
the
necessity
of
my
affair
oblige
me
to
mention
that
small
sum
which
I
have
the
honour
to
lend
you
the
other
night
at
play
;
and
which
<EOS>
I
shall
be
much
oblige
to
you
if
you
will
let
me
have
some
time
either
to
-
day
or
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
sir
,
Your
most
obedient
,
most
humble
servant
,
GEORGE
TRENT
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
letter
a
little
surprize
Booth
,
after
the
genteel
,
and
,
indeed
,
as
it
appear
,
generous
behaviour
of
Trent
.
<EOS>
but
lest
it
should
have
the
same
effect
upon
the
reader
,
we
will
now
proceed
to
account
for
this
,
as
well
as
for
some
other
phenomenon
that
have
appear
in
this
history
,
and
which
,
perhaps
,
we
shall
be
forgive
for
not
have
open
more
largely
before
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Trent
then
be
a
gentleman
possibly
of
a
good
family
,
for
it
be
not
certain
whence
<EOS>
he
spring
on
the
father
's
side
.
<EOS>
His
mother
,
who
be
the
only
parent
he
ever
know
or
hear
of
,
be
a
single
gentlewoman
,
and
for
some
time
carry
on
the
trade
of
a
milliner
in
covent
-
garden
.
<EOS>
She
send
her
son
,
at
the
age
of
eight
year
old
,
to
a
charity
-
school
,
where
he
remain
till
he
be
of
the
age
of
fourteen
,
without
make
any
great
proficiency
in
learning
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
not
very
probable
he
should
;
for
the
master
,
who
,
in
preference
to
a
very
learned
and
proper
man
,
be
choose
by
a
party
into
this
school
,
the
salary
of
which
be
upwards
of
a
hundred
pound
a
-
year
,
have
himself
never
travel
through
the
Latin
Grammar
,
and
be
,
in
truth
,
a
most
consummate
blockhead
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
age
of
fifteen
Mr.
Trent
be
put
clerk
to
an
attorney
,
where
he
remain
a
very
short
time
before
he
take
leave
of
his
master
;
rather
,
indeed
,
depart
without
take
leave
;
and
,
have
break
open
his
mother
's
escritore
,
and
carry
off
with
him
all
the
valuable
effect
he
there
find
,
to
the
amount
of
about
fifty
pound
,
he
march
off
to
sea
,
and
go
on
board
a
merchantman
,
whence
he
be
afterwards
press
into
a
man
of
war
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
service
he
continue
above
three
year
;
during
which
time
he
behave
so
ill
in
his
moral
character
that
he
twice
undergo
a
very
severe
discipline
for
theft
in
which
he
be
detect
;
but
at
the
same
time
,
he
behave
so
well
as
a
sailor
in
an
engagement
with
some
pirate
,
that
he
wipe
off
all
former
score
,
and
greatly
recommend
himself
to
his
captain
.
  
<EOS>
at
his
return
home
,
he
be
then
about
twenty
year
of
age
,
he
find
that
the
attorney
have
in
his
absence
marry
his
mother
,
have
bury
her
,
and
secure
all
her
effect
,
to
the
amount
,
as
he
be
inform
,
of
about
fifteen
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
trent
apply
to
his
stepfather
,
but
to
no
purpose
;
the
attorney
utterly
disown
him
,
nor
would
he
suffer
him
to
come
a
second
time
within
his
door
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
that
the
attorney
have
,
by
a
former
wife
,
an
only
daughter
,
a
great
favourite
,
who
be
about
the
same
age
with
Trent
himself
,
and
have
,
during
his
residence
at
her
father
's
house
,
take
a
very
great
like
to
this
young
fellow
,
who
be
extremely
handsome
and
perfectly
well
make
.
<EOS>
this
her
liking
be
not
,
during
his
absence
,
so
far
extinguish
but
that
it
immediately
revive
on
his
return
.
<EOS>
of
this
she
take
care
to
give
Mr.
Trent
proper
intimation
;
for
she
be
not
one
of
those
backward
and
delicate
lady
who
can
die
rather
than
make
the
first
overture
.
<EOS>
trent
be
overjoy
at
this
,
and
with
reason
,
for
she
be
a
very
lovely
girl
in
her
person
,
the
only
child
of
a
rich
father
;
and
the
prospect
of
so
complete
a
revenge
on
the
attorney
charm
him
above
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
to
be
as
short
in
the
matter
as
the
party
,
a
marriage
be
soon
consummate
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
attorney
at
first
rage
and
be
implacable
;
but
at
last
fondness
for
his
daughter
so
far
overcame
resentment
that
he
advance
a
sum
of
money
to
buy
his
son
-
in
-
law
(
for
now
he
acknowledge
him
as
such
)
an
ensign
's
commission
in
a
marching
regiment
then
order
to
Gibraltar
;
at
which
place
the
attorney
heartily
hope
that
Trent
may
be
knock
on
the
head
;
for
in
that
case
he
think
he
may
marry
his
daughter
more
agreeably
to
his
own
ambition
and
to
her
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
the
regiment
into
which
Trent
purchase
be
the
same
with
that
in
which
Booth
likewise
serve
;
the
one
be
an
ensign
,
and
the
other
a
lieutenant
,
in
the
two
additional
company
.
  
<EOS>
trent
have
no
blemish
in
his
military
capacity
.
<EOS>
though
he
have
have
but
an
indifferent
education
,
he
be
naturally
sensible
and
genteel
,
and
Nature
,
<EOS>
as
we
have
say
,
have
give
him
a
very
agreeable
person
.
<EOS>
He
be
likewise
a
very
bold
fellow
,
and
,
as
he
really
behave
himself
every
way
well
enough
while
he
be
at
Gibraltar
,
there
be
some
degree
of
intimacy
between
him
and
Booth
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
siege
be
over
,
and
the
additional
company
be
again
reduce
,
Trent
return
to
his
wife
,
who
receive
him
with
great
joy
and
affection
.
<EOS>
soon
after
this
an
accident
happen
which
prove
the
utter
ruin
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
end
in
break
his
heart
.
<EOS>
this
be
nothing
but
make
a
mistake
pretty
common
at
this
day
,
of
write
another
man
's
name
to
a
deed
instead
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
in
truth
this
matter
be
no
less
than
what
the
law
call
forgery
,
and
be
just
then
make
capital
by
an
act
of
parliament
.
<EOS>
from
this
offence
,
indeed
,
the
attorney
be
acquit
,
by
not
admit
the
proof
of
the
party
,
who
be
to
avoid
his
own
deed
by
his
evidence
,
and
therefore
no
witness
,
accord
to
those
excellent
rule
call
the
law
of
evidence
;
a
law
very
excellently
calculate
for
the
preservation
of
the
life
of
his
majesty
's
roguish
subject
,
and
most
notably
use
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
by
common
law
the
attorney
be
honourably
acquit
,
yet
,
<EOS>
as
common
sense
manifest
to
every
one
that
he
be
guilty
,
he
unhappily
lose
his
reputation
,
and
of
consequence
his
business
;
the
chagrin
of
which
latter
soon
put
an
end
to
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
this
prosecution
have
be
attend
with
a
very
great
expence
;
for
,
besides
the
ordinary
cost
of
avoid
the
gallow
by
the
help
of
the
law
,
there
be
a
very
high
article
,
of
no
less
than
a
thousand
pound
,
pay
down
to
remove
out
of
the
way
a
witness
against
whom
there
be
no
legal
exception
.
<EOS>
the
poor
gentleman
have
besides
suffer
some
loss
in
business
;
so
that
,
to
the
surprize
of
all
his
acquaintance
,
when
his
debt
be
pay
there
remain
no
more
than
a
small
estate
of
fourscore
pound
a
-
year
,
which
he
settle
upon
his
daughter
,
far
out
of
the
reach
of
her
husband
,
and
about
two
hundred
pound
in
money
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
have
not
long
be
in
his
grave
before
trent
set
himself
to
consider
seriously
of
the
state
of
his
affair
.
<EOS>
He
have
lately
begin
to
look
on
his
wife
with
a
much
less
degree
of
liking
and
desire
than
formerly
;
for
he
be
one
of
those
who
think
too
much
of
one
thing
be
good
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
indulge
these
speculation
so
far
,
that
I
believe
his
wife
,
though
one
of
the
pretty
woman
in
town
,
be
the
last
subject
that
he
would
have
choose
for
any
amorous
dalliance
.
  
<EOS>
many
other
person
,
however
,
greatly
differ
from
him
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
amongst
the
rest
be
the
illustrious
peer
of
amorous
memory
.
<EOS>
this
noble
peer
,
have
therefore
get
a
view
of
Mrs.
Trent
one
day
in
the
street
,
do
,
by
mean
of
an
emissary
then
with
him
,
make
himself
acquaint
with
her
lodging
,
to
which
he
immediately
lay
siege
in
form
,
set
himself
down
in
a
lodging
directly
opposite
to
her
,
from
whence
<EOS>
the
battery
of
ogle
begin
to
play
the
very
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
this
siege
have
not
continue
long
before
the
governor
of
the
garrison
become
sufficiently
apprize
of
all
the
work
which
be
carry
on
,
and
,
have
well
reconnoiter
the
enemy
,
and
discover
who
he
be
,
notwithstanding
a
false
name
and
some
disguise
of
his
person
,
he
call
a
council
of
war
within
his
own
breast
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
to
drop
all
allegory
,
he
begin
to
consider
whether
his
wife
be
not
really
a
more
valuable
possession
than
he
have
lately
think
her
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
as
he
have
be
disappoint
in
her
fortune
,
he
now
conceive
some
hope
of
turn
her
beauty
itself
into
a
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
without
communicate
these
view
to
her
,
he
soon
scrape
an
acquaintance
with
his
opposite
neighbour
by
the
name
which
he
there
usurp
,
and
counterfeit
an
entire
ignorance
of
his
real
name
and
title
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
trent
have
his
disguise
likewise
,
for
he
affect
the
utmost
simplicity
;
of
which
affectation
,
as
he
be
a
very
artful
fellow
,
he
be
extremely
capable
.
  
<EOS>
the
peer
fall
plumb
into
this
snare
;
and
when
,
by
the
simplicity
,
as
he
imagine
,
of
the
husband
,
he
become
acquaint
with
the
wife
,
he
be
so
extravagantly
charm
with
her
person
,
that
he
resolve
,
whatever
be
the
cost
or
the
consequence
,
he
would
possess
her
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
,
however
,
preserve
some
caution
in
his
management
of
this
affair
;
more
,
perhaps
,
than
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
husband
,
none
be
requisite
,
for
he
know
all
he
could
;
and
,
with
regard
to
the
wife
herself
,
as
she
have
for
some
time
perceive
the
decrease
of
her
husband
's
affection
(
for
few
woman
be
,
I
believe
,
to
be
impose
upon
in
that
matter
)
,
she
be
not
displeased
to
find
the
return
of
all
that
complaisance
and
endearment
,
of
those
look
and
languishment
,
from
another
agreeable
person
,
which
she
have
formerly
receive
from
Trent
,
and
which
she
now
find
she
should
receive
from
him
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
My
lord
,
therefore
,
have
be
indulge
with
as
much
opportunity
as
he
could
wish
from
Trent
,
and
have
receive
rather
more
encouragement
than
he
could
well
have
hope
from
the
lady
,
begin
to
prepare
all
matter
for
a
storm
,
when
luckily
,
Mr.
Trent
declare
he
must
go
out
of
town
for
two
day
,
he
fix
on
the
first
day
of
his
departure
as
the
time
of
carry
his
design
into
execution
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
after
some
debate
with
himself
in
what
manner
he
should
approach
his
love
,
he
at
last
determined
to
do
it
in
his
own
person
;
for
he
conceive
,
and
perhaps
very
rightly
,
that
the
lady
,
like
Semele
,
be
not
void
of
ambition
,
and
would
have
prefer
Jupiter
in
all
his
glory
to
the
same
deity
in
the
disguise
of
an
humble
shepherd
.
<EOS>
He
dress
himself
,
therefore
,
in
the
rich
embroidery
of
which
he
be
master
,
and
appear
before
his
mistress
array
in
all
the
brightness
of
peerage
;
a
sight
whose
charm
she
have
not
the
power
to
resist
,
and
the
consequence
be
only
to
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
same
scene
which
Jupiter
act
with
his
above
-
mention
mistress
of
old
be
more
than
begin
,
when
trent
burst
from
the
closet
into
which
he
have
convey
himself
,
and
unkindly
interrupt
the
action
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
presently
run
to
his
sword
;
but
Trent
,
with
great
calmness
,
answer
,
"
that
,
as
it
be
very
well
know
he
durst
fight
,
he
should
not
draw
his
sword
on
this
occasion
;
for
sure
,
"
say
he
,
"
my
lord
,
it
would
be
the
high
imprudence
in
me
to
kill
a
man
who
be
now
become
so
considerably
my
debtor
.
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
he
fetch
a
person
from
the
closet
,
who
have
be
confine
with
him
,
tell
him
he
have
do
his
business
,
and
may
now
,
if
he
please
,
retire
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
tedious
here
to
amuse
the
reader
with
all
that
pass
on
the
present
occasion
;
the
rage
and
confusion
of
the
wife
,
or
the
perplexity
in
which
my
lord
be
involve
.
<EOS>
We
will
omit
therefore
all
such
matter
,
and
proceed
directly
to
business
,
as
Trent
and
his
lordship
do
soon
after
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
conclusion
my
lord
stipulate
to
pay
a
good
round
sum
,
and
to
provide
Mr.
Trent
with
a
good
place
on
the
first
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
side
of
Mr.
Trent
be
stipulate
absolute
remission
of
all
past
,
and
full
indulgence
for
the
time
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
trent
now
immediately
take
a
house
at
the
polite
end
of
the
town
,
furnish
it
elegantly
,
and
set
up
his
equipage
,
rig
out
both
himself
and
his
wife
with
very
handsome
cloath
,
frequent
all
public
place
where
he
could
get
admission
,
push
himself
into
acquaintance
,
and
his
wife
soon
afterwards
begin
to
keep
an
assembly
,
or
,
in
the
fashionable
phrase
,
to
be
at
home
once
a
-
week
;
when
,
by
my
lord
's
assistance
,
she
be
presently
visit
by
most
man
of
the
first
rank
,
and
by
all
such
woman
of
fashion
as
be
not
very
nice
in
their
company
.
  
<EOS>
My
lord
's
amour
with
this
lady
last
not
long
;
for
,
as
we
have
before
observe
,
he
be
the
most
inconstant
of
all
human
race
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Trent
's
passion
be
not
however
of
that
kind
which
lead
to
any
very
deep
resentment
of
such
fickleness
.
<EOS>
Her
passion
,
indeed
,
be
principally
found
upon
interest
;
so
that
foundation
serve
to
support
another
superstructure
;
and
she
be
easily
prevail
upon
,
as
well
as
her
husband
,
to
be
useful
to
my
lord
in
a
capacity
which
,
though
very
often
exert
in
the
polite
world
,
hath
not
as
yet
,
to
my
great
surprize
,
acquire
any
polite
name
,
or
,
indeed
,
any
which
be
not
too
coarse
to
be
admit
in
this
history
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
preface
,
which
we
think
necessary
to
account
for
a
character
of
which
some
of
my
country
and
collegiate
reader
may
possibly
doubt
the
existence
,
I
shall
proceed
to
what
more
immediately
regard
Mrs.
Booth
.
<EOS>
the
reader
may
be
pleased
to
remember
that
Mr.
Trent
be
present
at
the
assembly
to
which
Booth
and
his
wife
be
carry
by
Mrs.
James
,
and
where
Amelia
be
meet
by
the
noble
peer
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
,
see
there
that
Booth
and
Trent
be
old
acquaintance
,
fail
not
,
to
use
the
language
of
sportsman
,
to
put
Trent
upon
the
scent
of
Amelia
.
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
that
gentleman
visit
Booth
the
very
next
day
,
and
have
pursue
him
close
ever
since
.
<EOS>
by
his
mean
,
therefore
,
my
lord
learn
that
Amelia
be
to
be
at
the
masquerade
,
to
which
place
she
be
dog
by
Trent
in
a
sailor
's
jacket
,
who
,
meet
my
lord
,
accord
to
agreement
,
at
the
entrance
of
the
opera
-
house
,
like
the
four
-
legged
gentleman
of
the
same
vocation
,
make
a
dead
point
,
as
it
be
call
,
at
the
game
.
  
<EOS>
My
lord
be
so
satisfied
and
delighted
with
his
conversation
at
the
masquerade
with
the
suppose
Amelia
,
and
the
encouragement
which
in
reality
she
have
give
him
,
that
,
when
he
see
Trent
the
next
morning
,
he
embrace
him
with
great
fondness
,
give
him
a
bank
note
of
a
hundred
pound
,
and
promise
him
both
the
Indies
on
his
success
,
of
which
he
begin
now
to
have
no
manner
of
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
the
affair
that
happen
at
the
gaming
-
table
be
likewise
a
scheme
of
Trent
's
,
on
a
hint
give
by
my
lord
to
him
to
endeavour
to
lead
Booth
into
some
scrape
or
distress
;
his
lordship
promise
to
pay
whatever
expense
trent
may
be
lead
into
by
such
mean
.
<EOS>
upon
his
lordship
's
credit
,
therefore
,
the
money
lend
to
Booth
be
really
advanced
.
<EOS>
and
hence
arise
all
that
seem
generosity
and
indifference
as
to
the
payment
;
trent
be
satisfied
with
the
obligation
confer
on
Booth
,
by
mean
of
which
he
hope
to
effect
his
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
the
scene
be
totally
change
;
for
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
the
morning
after
the
quarrel
,
begin
seriously
to
recollect
that
she
have
carry
the
matter
rather
too
far
,
and
may
really
injure
Amelia
's
reputation
,
a
thought
to
which
the
warm
pursuit
of
her
own
interest
have
a
good
deal
blind
her
at
the
time
,
resolve
to
visit
my
lord
himself
,
and
to
let
him
into
the
whole
story
;
for
,
as
she
have
succeed
already
in
her
favourite
point
,
she
think
she
have
no
reason
to
fear
any
consequence
of
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
this
resolution
she
immediately
execute
.
  
<EOS>
trent
come
to
attend
his
lordship
,
just
after
Mrs.
Atkinson
have
leave
him
.
<EOS>
He
find
the
peer
in
a
very
ill
humour
,
and
bring
no
news
to
comfort
or
recruit
his
spirit
;
for
he
have
himself
just
receive
a
billet
from
Booth
,
with
an
excuse
for
himself
and
his
wife
from
accept
the
invitation
at
Trent
's
house
that
evening
,
where
matter
have
be
previously
concert
for
their
entertainment
,
and
when
his
lordship
be
by
accident
to
drop
into
the
room
where
Amelia
be
,
while
Booth
be
to
be
engage
at
play
in
another
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
after
much
debate
,
and
after
Trent
have
acquaint
my
lord
with
the
wretched
situation
of
Booth
's
circumstance
<EOS>
,
it
be
resolve
that
Trent
should
immediately
demand
his
money
of
Booth
,
and
upon
his
not
pay
it
,
for
they
both
conclude
it
impossible
he
should
pay
it
,
to
put
the
note
which
Trent
have
for
the
money
in
suit
against
him
by
the
genteel
mean
of
pay
it
away
to
a
nominal
third
person
;
and
this
they
both
conceive
must
end
immediately
in
the
ruin
of
Booth
,
and
,
consequently
,
in
the
conquest
of
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
project
,
and
with
this
hope
,
both
my
lord
and
his
setter
,
or
(
if
the
sportsman
please
)
set
-
dog
,
both
greatly
exult
;
and
it
be
next
morning
execute
,
as
we
have
already
see
.
    
<EOS>
contain
some
distress
.
 
<EOS>
Trent
's
letter
drive
Booth
almost
to
madness
.
<EOS>
to
be
indebte
to
such
a
fellow
at
any
rate
have
stick
much
in
his
stomach
,
and
have
give
him
very
great
uneasiness
;
but
to
answer
this
demand
in
any
other
manner
than
by
pay
the
money
be
absolutely
what
he
could
not
bear
.
<EOS>
again
,
to
pay
this
money
,
he
very
plainly
see
there
be
but
one
way
,
and
this
be
,
by
strip
his
wife
,
not
only
of
every
farthing
,
but
almost
of
every
rag
she
have
in
the
world
;
a
thought
so
dreadful
that
it
chill
his
very
soul
with
horror
:
and
yet
pride
,
at
last
,
seem
to
represent
this
as
the
less
evil
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
to
do
this
be
still
a
question
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
sure
,
at
least
he
fear
it
be
not
,
that
Amelia
herself
would
readily
consent
to
this
;
and
so
far
from
persuade
her
to
such
a
measure
,
he
could
not
bear
even
to
propose
it
.
<EOS>
at
length
his
determination
be
to
acquaint
his
wife
with
the
whole
affair
,
and
to
ask
her
consent
,
by
way
of
ask
her
advice
;
for
he
be
well
assured
she
could
find
no
other
mean
of
extricate
him
out
of
his
dilemma
.
<EOS>
this
he
accordingly
do
,
represent
the
affair
as
bad
as
he
could
;
though
,
indeed
,
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
aggravate
the
real
truth
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
hear
him
patiently
,
without
once
interrupt
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
,
she
remain
silent
some
time
:
indeed
,
the
shock
she
receive
from
this
story
almost
deprive
her
of
the
power
of
speak
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
answer
,
"
well
,
my
dear
,
you
ask
my
advice
;
I
certainly
can
give
you
no
other
than
that
the
money
must
be
pay
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
must
it
be
pay
?
"
cry
he
.
"
<EOS>
o
,
heavens
!
<EOS>
thou
sweetest
creature
!
<EOS>
what
,
not
once
upbraid
me
for
bring
this
ruin
on
thee
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upbraid
you
,
my
dear
!
"
say
she
;
<EOS>
"
would
to
heaven
<EOS>
I
could
prevent
your
upbraid
yourself
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
despair
.
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
by
some
mean
or
other
to
get
you
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
my
dear
love
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
<EOS>
I
know
the
only
way
by
which
you
can
raise
it
.
<EOS>
how
can
I
consent
to
that
?
<EOS>
do
you
forget
the
fear
you
so
lately
express
of
what
would
be
our
wretched
condition
when
our
little
all
be
moulder
away
?
<EOS>
o
my
Amelia
!
<EOS>
they
cut
my
very
heart
-
string
when
you
speak
then
;
for
I
have
then
lose
this
little
all
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
assure
you
,
I
have
not
play
since
,
nor
ever
will
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
keep
that
resolution
,
"
say
she
,
"
my
dear
,
and
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
yet
recover
the
past
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
which
word
,
cast
her
eye
on
the
child
,
the
tear
burst
from
her
eye
,
and
she
cry
 
"
<EOS>
Heaven
will
,
I
hope
,
provide
for
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
pathetic
scene
now
ensue
between
the
husband
and
wife
,
which
would
not
,
perhaps
,
please
many
reader
to
see
draw
at
too
full
a
length
.
<EOS>
It
be
sufficient
to
say
that
this
excellent
woman
not
only
use
her
utmost
endeavour
to
stifle
and
conceal
her
own
concern
,
but
say
and
do
everything
in
her
power
to
allay
that
of
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
,
at
this
time
,
to
meet
a
person
whom
we
have
formerly
mention
in
the
course
of
our
history
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
have
a
place
in
the
War
-
office
,
and
pretend
to
be
a
man
of
great
interest
and
consequence
;
by
which
mean
he
do
not
only
receive
great
respect
and
court
from
the
inferiour
officer
,
but
actually
bubble
several
of
their
money
,
by
undertake
to
do
them
service
which
,
in
reality
,
be
not
within
his
power
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
I
have
know
few
great
man
who
have
not
be
beset
with
one
or
more
such
fellow
as
these
,
through
whom
the
inferior
part
of
mankind
be
oblige
to
make
their
court
to
the
great
man
themselves
;
by
which
mean
,
I
believe
,
principally
,
person
of
real
merit
have
often
be
deter
from
the
attempt
;
for
these
subaltern
coxcomb
ever
assume
an
equal
state
with
their
master
,
and
look
for
an
equal
degree
of
respect
to
be
pay
to
them
;
to
which
man
of
spirit
,
who
be
in
every
light
their
better
,
be
not
easily
bring
to
submit
.
<EOS>
these
fellow
,
indeed
,
themselves
have
a
jealous
eye
towards
all
great
ability
,
and
be
sure
,
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
,
to
keep
all
who
be
so
endowed
from
the
presence
of
their
master
.
<EOS>
They
use
their
master
as
bad
minister
have
sometimes
use
a
prince
 
<EOS>
they
keep
all
man
of
merit
from
his
ear
,
and
daily
sacrifice
his
true
honour
and
interest
to
their
own
profit
and
their
own
vanity
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Booth
be
go
to
his
appointment
with
this
man
,
Amelia
immediately
betook
herself
to
her
business
with
the
high
resolution
.
<EOS>
She
pack
up
,
not
only
her
own
little
trinket
,
and
those
of
the
child
,
but
the
great
part
of
her
own
poor
cloathe
(
for
she
be
but
barely
provide
)
,
and
then
drive
in
a
hackney
-
coach
to
the
same
pawnbroker
's
who
have
before
be
recommend
to
her
by
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
who
advance
her
the
money
she
desire
.
  
<EOS>
be
now
provide
with
her
sum
,
she
return
well
pleased
home
,
and
her
husband
come
in
soon
after
,
she
with
much
chearfulness
deliver
him
all
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
so
overjoyed
with
the
prospect
of
discharge
his
debt
to
Trent
,
that
he
do
not
perfectly
reflect
on
the
distress
to
which
his
family
be
now
reduce
.
<EOS>
the
good
-
humour
which
appear
in
the
countenance
of
Amelia
be
,
perhaps
,
another
help
to
stifle
those
reflexion
;
but
above
all
,
be
the
assurance
he
have
receive
from
the
great
man
,
whom
he
have
meet
at
a
coffee
-
house
,
and
who
have
promise
to
do
him
all
the
service
in
his
power
;
which
several
half
-
pay
subaltern
officer
assure
him
be
very
considerable
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
comfortable
news
he
acquaint
his
wife
,
who
either
be
,
or
seem
to
be
,
extremely
well
pleased
with
it
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
set
out
with
the
money
in
his
pocket
to
pay
his
friend
Trent
,
who
unluckily
for
him
happen
not
to
be
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
on
his
return
home
he
meet
his
old
friend
the
lieutenant
,
who
thankfully
pay
him
his
crown
,
and
insist
on
his
go
with
him
and
take
part
of
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
this
invitation
be
so
eager
and
pressing
,
that
poor
Booth
,
who
could
not
resist
much
importunity
,
comply
.
  
<EOS>
while
they
be
over
this
bottle
Booth
acquaint
his
friend
with
the
promise
he
have
receive
that
afternoon
at
the
coffee
-
house
,
with
which
the
old
gentleman
be
very
well
pleased
:
"
for
I
have
hear
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
gentleman
hath
very
powerful
interest
;
"
but
he
inform
him
likewise
that
he
have
hear
that
the
great
man
must
be
touch
,
for
that
he
never
do
anything
without
touch
.
<EOS>
of
this
,
indeed
,
the
great
man
himself
have
give
some
oblique
hint
,
by
say
,
with
great
sagacity
and
slyness
,
that
he
know
where
fifty
pound
may
be
deposit
to
much
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
answer
that
he
would
very
readily
advance
a
small
sum
if
he
have
it
in
his
power
,
but
that
at
present
it
be
not
so
,
for
that
he
have
no
more
in
the
world
than
the
sum
of
fifty
pound
,
which
he
owe
Trent
,
and
which
he
intend
to
pay
him
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
right
,
undoubtedly
,
to
pay
your
debt
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
;
"
but
sure
,
on
such
an
occasion
,
any
man
but
the
rank
usurer
would
be
content
to
stay
a
little
while
for
his
money
;
and
it
will
be
only
a
little
while
I
be
convince
<EOS>
;
for
,
if
you
deposit
this
sum
in
the
great
man
's
hand
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
you
will
succeed
immediately
in
get
your
commission
;
and
then
I
will
help
you
to
a
method
of
take
up
such
a
sum
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
persist
in
this
advice
,
and
back
it
with
every
argument
he
could
invent
,
declare
,
as
be
indeed
true
,
that
he
give
the
same
advice
which
he
would
pursue
be
the
case
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
long
reject
the
opinion
of
his
friend
,
till
,
as
they
have
not
argue
with
dry
lip
,
he
become
heated
with
wine
,
and
then
at
last
the
old
gentleman
succeed
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
such
be
his
love
,
either
for
Booth
or
for
his
own
opinion
,
and
perhaps
for
both
,
that
he
omit
nothing
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
He
even
endeavour
to
palliate
the
character
of
trent
,
and
unsaid
half
what
he
have
before
say
of
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
in
the
end
,
he
undertake
to
make
Trent
easy
,
and
to
go
to
him
the
very
next
morning
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Booth
at
last
yield
,
though
with
the
utmost
difficulty
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
have
he
know
quite
as
much
of
Trent
as
the
reader
doth
,
no
motive
whatsoever
would
have
prevail
on
him
to
have
take
the
old
gentleman
's
advice
.
    
<EOS>
contain
more
wormwood
and
other
ingredient
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
Booth
communicate
the
matter
to
Amelia
,
who
tell
him
she
would
not
presume
to
advise
him
in
an
affair
of
which
he
be
so
much
the
well
judge
.
  
<EOS>
while
Booth
remain
in
a
doubtful
state
what
conduct
to
pursue
Bound
come
to
make
him
a
visit
,
and
inform
him
that
he
have
be
at
Trent
's
house
,
but
find
him
not
at
home
,
add
that
he
would
pay
him
a
second
visit
that
very
day
,
and
would
not
rest
till
he
find
him
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
ashamed
to
confess
his
waver
resolution
in
an
affair
in
which
he
have
be
so
troublesome
to
his
friend
;
he
therefore
dress
himself
immediately
,
and
together
they
both
go
to
wait
on
the
little
great
man
,
to
whom
Booth
now
hope
to
pay
his
court
in
the
most
effectual
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Bound
have
be
longer
acquaint
with
the
modern
method
of
business
than
Booth
;
he
advise
his
friend
,
therefore
,
to
begin
with
tipping
(
as
it
be
call
)
<EOS>
the
great
man
's
servant
.
<EOS>
He
do
so
,
and
by
that
mean
get
speedy
access
to
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
man
receive
the
money
,
not
as
a
gudgeon
doth
a
bait
,
but
as
a
pike
receive
a
poor
gudgeon
into
his
maw
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
such
fellow
as
these
may
well
be
liken
to
that
voracious
fish
,
who
fatten
himself
by
devour
all
the
little
inhabitant
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
great
man
have
pocket
the
cash
,
he
shake
Booth
by
the
hand
,
and
tell
him
he
would
be
sure
to
slip
no
opportunity
of
serve
him
,
and
would
send
him
word
as
soon
as
any
offer
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
shall
stop
one
moment
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
perhaps
,
will
my
good
-
natured
reader
;
for
surely
it
must
be
a
hard
heart
which
be
not
affect
with
reflect
on
the
manner
in
which
this
poor
little
sum
be
raise
,
and
on
the
manner
in
which
it
be
bestow
.
<EOS>
a
worthy
family
,
the
wife
and
child
of
a
man
who
have
lose
his
blood
abroad
in
the
service
of
his
country
,
part
with
their
little
all
,
and
expose
to
cold
and
hunger
,
to
pamper
such
a
fellow
as
this
!
  
<EOS>
and
if
any
such
reader
as
I
mention
should
happen
to
be
in
reality
a
great
man
,
and
in
power
,
perhaps
the
horrour
of
this
picture
may
induce
him
to
put
a
final
end
to
this
abominable
practice
of
touch
,
as
it
be
call
;
by
which
,
indeed
,
a
set
of
leech
be
permit
to
suck
the
blood
of
the
brave
and
the
indigent
,
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
now
return
home
,
where
he
find
his
wife
with
Mrs.
James
.
<EOS>
Amelia
have
,
before
the
arrival
of
her
husband
,
absolutely
refuse
Mrs.
James
's
invitation
to
dinner
the
next
day
;
but
when
Booth
come
in
the
lady
renew
her
application
,
and
that
in
so
press
a
manner
,
that
Booth
second
her
;
for
,
though
he
have
enough
of
jealousy
in
his
temper
,
yet
such
be
his
friendship
to
the
colonel
,
and
such
his
gratitude
to
the
obligation
which
he
have
receive
from
him
,
that
his
own
unwillingness
to
believe
anything
of
him
,
co
-
operating
with
Amelia
's
endeavour
to
put
everything
in
the
fair
light
,
have
bring
him
to
acquit
his
friend
of
any
ill
design
.
<EOS>
to
this
,
perhaps
,
the
late
affair
concern
my
lord
have
moreover
contribute
;
for
it
seem
to
me
that
the
same
passion
can
not
much
energize
on
two
different
object
at
one
and
the
same
time
:
an
observation
which
,
I
believe
,
will
hold
as
true
with
regard
to
the
cruel
passion
of
jealousy
and
anger
as
to
the
gentle
passion
of
love
,
in
which
one
great
and
mighty
object
be
sure
to
engage
the
whole
passion
.
  
<EOS>
when
Booth
grow
importunate
,
Amelia
answer
,
"
My
dear
,
I
should
not
refuse
you
whatever
be
in
my
power
;
but
this
be
absolutely
out
of
my
power
;
for
since
I
must
declare
the
truth
,
I
can
not
dress
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
"
say
Mrs.
James
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
be
in
good
health
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
no
other
impediment
to
dress
but
want
of
health
,
madam
?
"
answer
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
none
that
I
know
of
,
"
reply
Mrs.
James
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
want
of
cloathe
,
madam
?
"
say
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
ridiculous
!
"
cry
Mrs.
James
.
<EOS>
"
what
need
have
you
to
dress
yourself
out
?
<EOS>
You
will
see
nobody
but
our
own
family
,
and
I
promise
you
I
do
not
expect
it
.
<EOS>
a
plain
night
-
gown
will
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
I
must
be
plain
with
you
,
madam
,
"
say
Amelia
,
"
I
have
no
other
cloathe
but
<EOS>
what
I
have
now
on
my
back
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
even
a
clean
shift
in
the
world
;
for
you
must
know
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
to
Booth
,
"
that
little
Betty
be
walk
off
this
morning
,
and
hath
carry
all
my
linen
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Booth
;
"
little
Betty
rob
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
even
so
,
"
answer
Amelia
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
speak
truth
;
for
little
Betty
,
have
perceive
the
evening
before
that
her
mistress
be
move
her
good
,
be
willing
to
lend
all
the
assistance
in
her
power
,
and
have
accordingly
move
off
early
that
morning
,
take
with
her
whatever
she
could
lay
her
hand
on
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
express
himself
with
some
passion
on
the
occasion
,
and
swear
he
would
make
an
example
of
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
if
the
little
slut
be
above
ground
,
"
cry
he
,
"
I
will
find
her
out
,
and
bring
her
to
justice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
really
sorry
for
this
accident
,
"
say
Mrs.
James
,
"
and
(
though
I
know
not
how
to
mention
it
)
I
beg
you
will
give
me
leave
to
offer
you
any
linen
of
mine
till
you
can
make
new
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
thank
Mrs.
James
,
but
decline
the
favour
,
say
,
she
should
do
well
enough
at
home
;
and
that
,
as
she
have
no
servant
now
to
take
care
of
her
child
,
she
could
not
,
nor
would
not
,
leave
them
on
any
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
bring
master
and
miss
with
you
,
"
say
Mrs.
James
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
positively
dine
with
us
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
,
madam
,
you
will
mention
it
no
more
,
"
say
Amelia
;
"
for
,
besides
the
substantial
reason
I
have
already
give
,
I
have
some
thing
on
my
mind
at
present
which
make
me
unfit
for
company
;
and
I
be
resolve
nothing
shall
prevail
on
me
to
stir
from
home
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
James
have
carry
her
invitation
already
to
the
very
utmost
limit
of
good
breeding
,
if
not
beyond
them
.
<EOS>
She
desist
therefore
from
go
any
further
,
and
,
after
some
short
stay
longer
,
take
her
leave
,
with
many
expression
of
concern
,
which
,
however
,
great
as
it
be
,
leave
her
heart
and
her
mouth
together
before
she
be
out
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
now
declare
that
he
would
go
in
pursuit
of
little
Betty
,
against
whom
he
vow
so
much
vengeance
,
that
Amelia
endeavour
to
moderate
his
anger
by
represent
to
him
the
girl
's
youth
,
and
that
this
be
the
first
fault
she
have
ever
be
guilty
of
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
should
be
very
glad
to
have
my
thing
again
,
and
I
would
have
the
girl
too
punish
in
some
degree
,
which
may
possibly
be
for
her
own
good
;
but
I
tremble
to
think
of
take
away
her
life
;
"
for
Booth
in
his
rage
have
swear
he
would
hang
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
tenderness
of
your
heart
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
and
I
love
you
for
it
;
but
I
must
beg
leave
to
dissent
from
your
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
the
girl
in
any
light
an
object
of
mercy
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
only
guilty
of
dishonesty
but
of
cruelty
;
for
she
must
know
our
situation
and
the
very
little
we
have
leave
.
<EOS>
She
be
besides
guilty
of
ingratitude
to
you
,
who
have
treat
her
with
so
much
kindness
,
that
you
have
rather
act
the
part
of
a
mother
than
of
a
mistress
.
<EOS>
and
,
so
far
from
think
her
youth
an
excuse
,
I
think
it
rather
an
aggravation
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
there
be
fault
which
the
youth
of
the
party
very
strongly
recommend
to
our
pardon
.
<EOS>
such
be
all
those
which
proceed
from
carelessness
and
want
of
thought
;
but
crime
of
this
black
dye
,
which
be
commit
with
deliberation
,
and
imply
a
bad
mind
,
deserve
a
more
severe
punishment
in
a
young
person
than
in
one
of
riper
year
;
for
what
must
the
mind
be
in
old
age
which
hath
acquire
such
a
degree
of
perfection
in
villany
so
very
early
?
<EOS>
such
person
as
these
it
be
really
a
charity
to
the
public
to
put
out
of
the
society
;
and
,
indeed
,
a
religious
man
would
put
them
out
of
the
world
for
the
sake
of
themselves
;
for
whoever
understand
anything
of
human
nature
must
know
that
such
people
,
the
longer
they
live
,
the
more
they
will
accumulate
vice
and
wickedness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
I
can
not
argue
with
you
on
these
subject
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
submit
to
your
superior
judgment
,
and
I
know
you
too
well
to
think
that
you
will
ever
do
anything
cruel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
then
leave
Amelia
to
take
care
of
her
child
,
and
go
in
pursuit
of
the
thief
.
    
<EOS>
a
scene
of
the
tragic
kind
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
long
go
before
a
thundering
knock
be
hear
at
the
door
of
the
house
where
Amelia
lodge
,
and
presently
after
a
figure
all
pale
,
ghastly
,
and
almost
breathless
,
rush
into
the
room
where
she
then
be
with
her
child
.
  
<EOS>
this
figure
Amelia
soon
recognise
to
be
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
though
indeed
she
be
so
disguise
that
at
her

His

into

<EOS>
"
  
"
upon

I

I

as
I
think
him
to

one
of
the
best

natured

honest
creature
upon

<EOS>
I
be
sure
if
I
could
do
him
any
service
 
<EOS>

of
what
use
can
my
going
be

"
  
<EOS>
"
of

answer
Mrs.

<EOS>
"
if

<EOS>
do

Mrs.

"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
honour
he
do

answer
she

and
much
more
than
I
have
relate

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
will
go
with
you
,
"
cry
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
guess
what
this
should
be
;
but
I
will
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Atkinson
then
pour
out
a
thousand
blessing
and
thanksgiving
;
and
,
take
hold
of
Amelia
's
hand
,
and
eagerly
kiss
it
,
cry
out
,
"
how
could
that
fury
passion
drive
me
to
quarrel
with
such
a
creature
?
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
tell
her
she
have
forgive
and
forget
it
;
and
then
,
call
up
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
and
commit
to
her
the
care
of
the
child
,
she
cloak
herself
up
as
well
as
she
could
and
set
out
with
Mrs.
Atkinson
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
at
the
house
,
Mrs.
Atkinson
say
she
would
go
first
and
give
the
captain
some
notice
;
for
that
,
if
Amelia
enter
the
room
unexpectedly
,
the
surprize
may
have
an
ill
effect
.
<EOS>
She
leave
therefore
Amelia
in
the
parlour
,
and
proceed
directly
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Atkinson
,
weak
and
bad
as
be
his
condition
,
no
sooner
hear
that
Amelia
be
come
than
he
discover
great
joy
in
his
countenance
,
and
presently
afterwards
she
be
introduce
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Atkinson
exert
his
utmost
strength
to
thank
her
for
this
goodness
to
a
die
man
(
for
so
he
call
himself
)
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
should
not
have
presume
to
give
her
this
trouble
,
have
he
not
have
something
which
he
think
of
consequence
to
say
to
her
,
and
which
he
could
not
mention
to
any
other
person
.
<EOS>
He
then
desire
his
wife
to
give
him
a
little
box
,
of
which
he
always
keep
the
key
himself
,
and
afterwards
beg
her
to
leave
the
room
for
a
few
minute
;
at
which
neither
she
nor
Amelia
express
any
dissatisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
alone
with
Amelia
,
he
speak
as
follow
:
"
<EOS>
this
,
madam
,
be
the
last
time
my
eye
will
ever
behold
what
 
do
pardon
me
,
madam
,
I
will
never
offend
you
more
.
<EOS>
"
here
he
sink
down
in
his
bed
,
and
the
tear
gush
from
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
fear
to
offend
me
,
Joe
?
"
say
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
never
do
anything
willingly
to
offend
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

madam
,
"
answer
he
,
"
I
would
die
a
thousand
time
before
I
would
have
venture
it
in
the
small
matter
.
<EOS>
but
 
I
can
not
speak
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
must
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
pardon
me
,
and
yet
,
perhaps
,
as
I
be
a
die
man
,
and
never
shall
see
you
more
 
indeed
,
if
I
be
to
live
after
this
discovery
,
I
should
never
dare
to
look
you
in
the
face
again
;
and
yet
,
madam
,
to
think
I
shall
never
see
you
more
be
bad
than
ten
thousand
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
,
Mr.
Atkinson
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
blush
,
and
look
down
on
the
floor
,
"
I
must
not
hear
you
talk
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
anything
to
say
,
tell
it
me
,
and
do
not
be
afraid
of
my
anger
;
for
I
think
I
may
promise
to
forgive
whatever
it
be
possible
you
should
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
here
then

your
picture

eighteen
year

and
have
keep
it
ever
since
.
<EOS>
It
be
set
in
gold
,
with
three
little
diamond

and
yet
I
can
truly
say
it
be
not
the
gold
nor
the
diamond
which
I
steal
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
face
,
which
,
if
I

the
emperor
of

I
must
not

any
more
of
this
,

"
<EOS>

no
more
of
this
matter

I
freely
and
heartily
forgive
you
 
but
pray
compose
yourself
;
come
,
let
me
call
in
your
wife
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
first
,
madam
,
let
me
beg
one
favour
,
"
cry
he
:
<EOS>
"
consider
it
be
the
last
,
and
then
I
shall
die
in
peace
 
<EOS>
let
me
kiss
that
hand
before
I
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

"
say
she
,
"
I
do
not
know
what
I
be

<EOS>
well
 
there
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
carelessly
give
him
her
hand
,
which
he
put
gently
to
his
lip
,
and
then
presently
let
it
drop
,
and
fall
back
in
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
now
summon
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
who
be
indeed
no
further
off
than
just
without
the
door
.
<EOS>
She

and
call
for
a
great
glass
of
water
,
which
have
drink
off
,
she
throw
herself
into
a
chair
,
and
the
tear
run
plentifully
from
her
eye
with
compassion
for
the
poor
wretch
she
have
just
leave
in
his
bed
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
without
any
injury
to
her
chastity
,
that
heart
,
which
have
stand
firm
as
a
rock
to
all
the
attack
of
title
and
equipage
,
of
finery
and
flattery
,
and
which
all
the
treasure
of
the
universe
could
not
have
purchase
,
be
yet
a
little
soften
by
the
plain
,
honest
,
modest
,
involuntary
,
delicate
,
heroic
passion
of
this
poor
and
humble
swain
;
for
whom
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
she
feel
a
momentary
tenderness
and
complacence
,
at
which
Booth
,
if
he
have
know
it
,
would
perhaps
have
be
displease
.
  
<EOS>
have
staid
some
time
in
the
parlour
,
and
not
find
Mrs.
Atkinson
come
down
(
for
indeed
her
husband
be
then
so
bad
she
could
not
quit
him
)
,
Amelia
leave
a
message
with
the
maid
of
the
house
for
her
mistress
,
purport
that
she
should
be
ready
to
do
anything
in
her
power
to
serve
her
,
and
then
leave
the
house
with
a
confusion
on
her
mind
that
she
have
never
feel
before
,
and
which
any
chastity
that
be
not
hew
out
of
marble
must
feel
on
so
tender
and
delicate
an
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Mr.
Booth
meet
with
more
than
one
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
Booth
,
have
hunt
for
about
two
hour
,
at
last
see
a
young
lady
in
a
tattere
silk
gown
step
out
of
a
shop
in
Monmouth
 
street
into
a
hackney

<EOS>
this
lady
,
notwithstanding
the
disguise
of
her
dress

no
other
than
little
Betty

<EOS>
upon
which
Mrs.
Betty
be
immediately
stopt
in
her
vehicle
,
and
Booth
and
his
myrmidon
lay
hold
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
girl
no
sooner
find
that
she
be
seise
by
her
master
than
the
consciousness
of
her
guilt
overpower
her
;
for
she
be
not
yet
an
experienced
offender
,
and
she
immediately
confess
her
crime
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
then
carry
before
a
justice
of
peace
,
where
she
be
search
,
and
there
be
find
in
her
possession
four
shilling
and
sixpence
in
money
,
besides
the
silk
gown
,
which
be
indeed
proper
furniture
for
rag
-
fair
,
and
scarce
worth
a
single
farthing
,
though
the
honest
shopkeeper
in
Monmouth
-
street
have
sell
it
for
a
crown
to
the
simple
girl
.
  
<EOS>
the
girl
,
be
examine
by
the
magistrate
,
speak
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
,
an't
please
your
worship
,
I
be
very
sorry
for
what
I
have
do
;
and
to
be
sure
,
an't
please
your
honour
,
my
lord
,
it
must
have
be
the
devil
that
put
me
upon
it
;
for
to
be
sure
,
please
your
majesty
,
I
never
think
upon
such
a
thing
in
my
whole
life
before
,
any
more
than
I
do
of
my
dying
-
day
;
but
,
indeed
,
sir
,
an't
please
your
worship
<EOS>
"
  
She
be
run
on
in
this
manner
when
the
justice
interrupt
her
,
and
desire
her
to
give
an
account
of
what
she
have
take
from
her
master
,
and
what
she
have
do
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
an't
please
your
majesty
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
I
take
no
more
than
two
shift
of
madam
's
,
and
I
pawn
them
for
five
shilling
,
which
I
give
for
the
gown
that
be
upon
my
back
;
and
as
for
the
money
in
my
pocket
,
it
be
every
farthing
of
it
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
intend
to
carry
back
the
shift
too
as
soon
as
ever
I
could
get
money
to
take
them
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
girl
have
tell
them
where
the
pawnbroker
live
,
the
justice
send
to
him
,
to
produce
the
shift
,
which
he
presently
do
;
for
he
expect
that
a
warrant
to
search
his
house
would
be
the
consequence
of
his
refusal
.
  
<EOS>
the
shift
be
produce
,
on
which
the
honest
pawnbroker
have
lend
five
shilling
,
appear
plainly
to
be
worth
above
thirty
;
indeed
,
when
new
they
have
cost
much
more
:
<EOS>
so
that
,
by
their
goodness
as
well
as
by
their
size
,
it
be
certain
they
could
not
have
belong
to
the
girl
.
<EOS>
Booth
grow
very
warm
against
the
pawnbroker
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
"
say
he
to
the
justice
,
"
there
be
some
punishment
for
this
fellow
likewise
,
who
so
plainly
appear
to
have
know
that
these
good
be
steal
.
<EOS>
the
shop
of
these
fellow
may
indeed
be
call
the
fountain
of
theft
;
for
it
be
in
reality
the
encouragement
which
they
meet
with
from
these
receiver
of
their
good
that
induce
man
very
often
to
become
thief
,
so
that
these
deserve
equal
if
not
severe
punishment
than
the
thief
themselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
pawnbroker
protest
his
innocence
,
and
deny
the
taking
in
the
shift
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
in
this
he
speak
truth
,
for
he
have
slipt
into
an
inner
room
,
as
be
always
his
custom
on
these
occasion
,
and
leave
a
little
boy
to
do
the
business
;
by
which
mean
he
have
carry
on
the
trade
of
receive
steal
good
for
many
year
with
impunity
,
and
have
be
twice
acquit
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
though
the
juggle
appear
upon
the
most
manif
evidence
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
justice
be
go
to
speak
he
be
interrupt
by
the
girl
,
who
,
fall
upon
her
knee
to
Booth
,
with
many
tear
beg
his
forgiveness
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Betty
,
"
cry
Booth
<EOS>
,
"
you
do
not
deserve
forgiveness
;
for
you
know
very
good
reason
why
you
should
not
have
think
of
rob
your
mistress
,
particularly
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
and
what
further
aggravate
your
crime
be
,
that
you
rob
the
good
and
kind
mistress
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
nay
,
you
be
not
only
guilty
of
felony
,
but
of
a
felonious
breach
of
trust
,
for
you
know
very
well
<EOS>
everything
your
mistress
have
be
intrust
to
your
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
it
happen
,
by
very
great
accident
,
that
the
justice
before
whom
the
girl
be
bring
understand
the
law
.
<EOS>
turn
therefore
to
Booth
,
he
say
,
"
do
you
say
,
sir
,
that
this
girl
be
intrust
with
the
shift
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
she
be
intrust
with
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
will
you
swear
that
the
good
steal
,
"
say
the
justice
,
"
be
worth
forty
shilling
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
indeed
,
sir
,
"
answer
Booth
,
"
nor
that
they
be
worthy
<EOS>
thirty
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
sir
,
"
cry
the
justice
,
"
the
girl
can
not
be
guilty
of
felony
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
,
sir
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
be
it
not
a
breach
of
trust
?
<EOS>
and
be
not
a
breach
of
trust
felony
,
and
the
bad
felony
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
justice
;
"
a
breach
of
trust
be
no
crime
in
our
law
,
unless
it
be
in
a
servant
;
and
then
the
act
of
parliament
require
the
good
take
to
be
of
the
value
of
forty
shilling
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
then
a
servant
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
may
rob
his
master
of
thirty
-
nine
shilling
whenever
he
please
,
and
he
can
not
be
punish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
the
good
be
under
his
care
,
he
can
not
,
"
cry
the
justice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
say
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
what
you
say
;
but
sure
this
be
a
very
extraordinary
law
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
think
so
too
,
"
say
the
justice
;
"
but
it
belong
not
to
my
office
to
make
or
to
mend
law
.
<EOS>
My
business
be
only
to
execute
them
.
<EOS>
if
therefore
the
case
be
as
you
say
,
I
must
discharge
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
however
,
you
will
punish
the
pawnbroker
,
"
cry
Booth
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
the
girl
be
discharge
,
"
cry
the
justice
,
"
<EOS>
so
must
be
the
pawnbroker
;
for
,
if
the
good
be
not
steal
,
he
can
not
be
guilty
of
receive
them
know
them
to
be
steal
.
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
as
to
his
offence
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
be
almost
weary
of
prosecute
it
;
for
such
be
the
difficulty
lay
in
the
way
of
this
prosecution
,
that
it
be
almost
impossible
to
convict
any
one
on
it
.
<EOS>
and
,
to
speak
my
opinion
plainly
,
such
be
the
law
,
and
such
the
method
of
proceeding
<EOS>
,
that
one
would
almost
think
our
law
be
rather
make
for
the
protection
of
rogue
than
for
the
punishment
of
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
end
this
examination
:
the
thief
and
the
receiver
go
about
their
business
,
and
Booth
depart
in
order
to
go
home
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
in
his
way
home
Booth
be
meet
by
a
lady
in
a
chair
,
who
,
immediately
upon
see
him
,
stopt
her
chair
,
bolt
out
of
it
,
and
,
go
directly
up
to
him
,
say
,
"
so
,
Mr.
Booth
,
you
have
keep
your
word
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
lady
be
no
other
than
Miss
Matthews
,
and
the
speech
she
mean
be
of
a
promise
make
to
her
at
the
masquerade
of
visit
her
within
a
day
or
two
;
which
,
whether
he
ever
intend
to
keep
I
can
not
say
,
but
,
in
truth
,
the
several
accident
that
have
since
happen
to
him
have
so
discompose
his
mind
that
he
have
absolutely
forget
it
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
,
however
,
be
too
sensible
and
too
well
-
breed
to
make
the
excuse
of
forgetfulness
to
a
lady
;
nor
could
he
readily
find
any
other
.
<EOS>
while
he
stand
therefore
hesitate
,
and
look
not
over
-
wise
,
Miss
Matthews
say
,
"
well
,
sir
,
since
by
your
confusion
<EOS>
I
see
you
have
some
grace
leave
<EOS>
,
I
will
pardon
you
on
one
condition
,
and
that
be
that
you
will
sup
with
me
this
night
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
fail
me
now
,
expect
all
the
revenge
of
an
injure
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
bind
herself
by
a
most
outrageous
oath
that
she
would
complain
to
his
wife
"
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
,
"
say
she
,
"
she
be
so
much
a
woman
of
honour
as
to
do
me
justice
.
<EOS>
and
,
though
I
miscarry
in
my
first
attempt
,
be
assure
I
will
take
care
of
my
second
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
ask
what
she
mean
by
her
first
attempt
;
to
which
she
answer
that
she
have
already
writ
his
wife
an
account
of
his
ill
-
usage
of
her
,
but
that
she
be
please
it
have
miscarry
.
<EOS>
She
then
repeat
her
asseveration
that
she
would
now
do
it
effectually
if
he
disappoint
her
.
  
<EOS>
this
threat
she
reckon
would
most
certainly
terrify
poor
Booth
;
and
,
indeed
,
she
be
not
mistake
;
for
I
believe
it
would
have
be
impossible
,
by
any
other
menace
or
by
any
other
mean
,
to
have
bring
him
once
even
to
balance
in
his
mind
on
this
question
.
<EOS>
but
by
this
threat
she
prevail
;
and
Booth
promise
,
upon
his
word
and
honour
,
to
come
to
her
at
the
hour
she
appoint
.
<EOS>
after
which
she
take
leave
of
him
with
a
squeeze
by
the
hand
,
and
a
smile
countenance
,
and
walk
back
to
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
however
she
may
be
pleased
with
have
obtain
this
promise
,
Booth
be
far
from
be
delighted
with
the
thought
of
have
give
it
.
<EOS>
He
look
,
indeed
,
upon
the
consequence
of
this
meeting
with
horrour
;
but
as
to
the
consequence
which
be
so
apparently
intend
by
the
lady
,
he
resolve
against
it
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
come
to
this
determination
,
to
go
accord
to
his
appointment
,
to
argue
the
matter
with
the
lady
,
and
to
convince
her
,
if
possible
,
that
,
from
a
regard
to
his
honour
only
,
he
must
discontinue
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
if
this
fail
to
satisfy
her
,
and
she
still
persist
in
her
threat
to
acquaint
his
wife
with
the
affair
,
he
then
resolve
,
whatever
pain
it
cost
him
,
to
communicate
the
whole
truth
himself
to
Amelia
,
from
whose
goodness
he
doubt
not
but
to
obtain
an
absolute
remission
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Amelia
appear
in
a
light
more
amiable
than
gay
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
now
return
to
Amelia
,
whom
we
leave
in
some
perturbation
of
mind
depart
from
Mrs.
Atkinson
.
  
<EOS>
though
she
have
before
walk
through
the
street
in
a
very
improper
dress
with
Mrs.
Atkinson
<EOS>
,
she
be
unwilling
,
especially
as
she
be
alone
,
to
return
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
be
scarce
able
to
walk
in
her
present
condition
;
for
the
case
of
poor
Atkinson
have
much
affect
her
tender
heart
,
and
her
eye
have
overfly
with
many
tear
.
  
<EOS>
It
occur
likewise
to
her
at
present
that
she
have
not
a
single
shilling
in
her
pocket
or
at
home
to
provide
food
for
herself
and
her
family
.
<EOS>
in
this
situation
she
resolve
to
go
immediately
to
the
pawnbroker
whither
she
have
go
before
,
and
to
deposit
her
picture
for
what
she
could
raise
upon
it
.
<EOS>
She
then
immediately
take
a
chair
and
put
her
design
in
execution
.
  
<EOS>
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
gold
in
which
this
picture
be
set
,
and
of
the
little
diamond
which
surround
it
,
amount
to
nine
guinea
.
<EOS>
this
therefore
be
advanced
to
her
,
and
the
pretty
face
in
the
world
(
such
be
often
the
fate
of
beauty
)
be
deposit
,
as
of
no
value
,
into
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
come
home
she
find
the
following
letter
from
Mrs.
Atkinson
:
    
"
my
DEAREST
MADAM
,
 
<EOS>
as
I
know
your
goodness
,
I
could
not
delay
a
moment
acquaint
you
with
the
happy
turn
of
my
affair
since
you
go
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
on
his
return
to
visit
my
husband
,
have
assure
me
that
the
captain
be
on
the
recovery
,
and
in
very
little
danger
;
and
I
really
think
he
be
since
mend
.
<EOS>
I
hope
to
wait
on
you
soon
with
well
news
.
<EOS>
Heaven
bless
you
,
dear
madam
!
<EOS>
and
believe
me
to
be
,
with
the
utmost
sincerity
,
       
Your
most
oblige
,
obedient
,
humble
servant
,
                     
ATKINSON
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
be
really
pleased
with
this
letter
;
and
now
,
it
be
past
four
o'clock
,
she
despair
of
see
her
husband
till
the
evening
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
provide
some
tart
for
her
child
,
and
then
,
eat
nothing
but
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
herself
,
she
begin
to
prepare
for
the
captain
's
supper
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
thing
of
which
her
husband
be
particularly
fond
,
which
,
though
it
may
bring
the
simplicity
of
his
taste
into
great
contempt
with
some
of
my
reader
,
I
will
venture
to
name
.
<EOS>
these
be
a
fowl
and
egg
sauce
and
mutton
broth
;
both
which
Amelia
immediately
purchase
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
clock
strike
seven
the
good
creature
go
down
into
the
kitchen
,
and
begin
to
exercise
her
talent
of
cookery
,
of
which
she
be
a
great
mistress
,
as
she
be
of
every
economical
office
from
the
high
to
the
low
:
and
,
as
no
woman
could
outshine
her
in
a
drawing
-
room
,
so
none
could
make
the
drawing
-
room
itself
shine
brighter
than
Amelia
.
<EOS>
and
,
if
I
may
speak
a
bold
truth
,
I
question
whether
it
be
possible
to
view
this
fine
creature
in
a
more
amiable
light
than
while
she
be
dress
her
husband
's
supper
,
with
her
little
child
play
round
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
half
an
hour
past
eight
,
and
the
meat
almost
ready
,
the
table
likewise
neatly
spread
with
material
borrow
from
her
landlady
,
and
she
begin
to
grow
a
little
uneasy
at
Booth
's
not
return
when
a
sudden
knock
at
the
door
rouse
her
spirit
,
and
she
cry
,
"
there
,
my
dear
,
there
be
your
good
papa
;
"
at
which
word
she
dart
swiftly
upstairs
and
open
the
door
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
She
desire
her
husband
to
walk
up
into
the
dining
-
room
,
and
she
would
come
to
him
in
an
instant
;
for
she
be
desirous
to
encrease
his
pleasure
by
surprise
him
with
his
two
favourite
dish
.
<EOS>
She
then
go
down
again
to
the
kitchen
,
where
the
maid
of
the
house
undertake
to
send
up
the
supper
,
and
she
with
her
child
return
to
Booth
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
tell
her
concisely
what
have
happen
with
relation
to
the
girl
 
to
which
she
scarce
make
any
answer
,
but
ask
him
if
he
have
not
dine
?
<EOS>
He
assure
her
he
have
not
eat
a
morsel
the
whole
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
she
,
"
my
dear
,
I
be
a
fellow
-
sufferer
;
but
we
shall
both
enjoy
our
supper
the
more
;
for
I
have
make
a
little
provision
for
you
,
as
I
guess
what
may
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
you
a
bottle
of
wine
too
.
<EOS>
and
here
be
a
clean
cloth
and
a
smile
countenance
,
my
dear
will
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
in
unusual
good
spirit
to
-
night
,
and
I
have
make
a
promise
to
the
child
,
which
you
must
confirm
;
I
have
promise
to
let
them
sit
up
this
one
night
to
supper
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
do
not
look
so
serious
:
cast
off
all
uneasy
thought
,
I
have
a
present
for
you
here
 
<EOS>
no
matter
how
I
come
by
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
which
word
she
put
eight
guinea
into
his
hand
,
cry
,
"
come
,
my
dear
Bill
,
be
gay
 
<EOS>
Fortune
will
yet
be
kind
to
us
 
<EOS>
at
least
let
us
be
happy
this
night
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
pleasure
of
many
woman
during
their
whole
life
will
not
amount
to
my
happiness
this
night
if
you
will
be
in
good
humour
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
and
cry
,
"
how
unhappy
be
I
,
my
dear
,
that
I
can
not
sup
with
you
to
-
night
!
"
  
<EOS>
as
in
the
delightful
month
of
June
,
when
the
sky
be
all
serene
,
and
the
whole
face
of
nature
look
with
a
pleasing
and
smile
aspect
,
suddenly
a
dark
cloud
spread
itself
over
the
hemisphere
,
the
sun
vanish
from
our
sight
,
and
every
object
be
obscure
by
a
dark
and
horrid
gloom
;
so
happen
it
to
Amelia
:
the
joy
that
have
enlighten
every
feature
disappear
in
a
moment
;
the
lustre
forsook
her
shine
eye
,
and
all
the
little
love
that
play
and
wanton
in
her
cheek
hang
their
drooping
head
,
and
with
a
faint
trembling
voice
she
repeat
her
husband
's
word
,
"
not
sup
with
me
to
-
night
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
my
dear
,
"
answer
he
,
"
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
how
uneasy
it
make
me
,

it
be
a
very
particular
disappointment
to
me

to

night
,
when
I
have
propose
unusual
pleasure
;

the

reason
which

sufficient
to

ought
to
be
so
to

"
  
<EOS>
Booth
make
his
wife
a
compliment
on
her
ready
compliance
,
and
then
ask
her
what
she
intend
by

him
that
money

or
how

not
very
material

<EOS>
You
be
well
assured
I

it
by
no

which
would
displease
you

and

perhaps

"
  
<EOS>
Booth
ask
no
farth
question
;
but
he
return
her
,
and
insist
on
her
taking
,
all
but
one
guinea
,
say
she
be
the
safe
treasurer
.
<EOS>
He
then
promise
her
to
make
all
the
haste
home
in
his
power
,
and
he
hope
,
he
say
,
to
be
with
her
in
an
hour
and
half
at
farth
,
and
then
take
his
leave
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
the
poor
disappointed
Amelia
sit
down
to
supper
with
her
child
,
with
whose
company
she
be
force
to
console
herself
for
the
absence
of
her

<EOS>
a

<EOS>
the
clock
have
strike
eleven

and
Amelia
be
just
proceed
to

,
when

;
upon
which
the
boy
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
there
be
papa
,
mamma
;
pray
let
me
stay
and
see
him
before
I
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
favour
very
easily
obtain
;
for
Amelia
instantly
run
down
-
stair
,
exult
in
the
goodness
of
her
husband
for
return
so
soon
,
though
half
an
hour
be
already
elapse
beyond
the
time
in
which
he
promise
to
return
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Amelia
be
now
again
disappoint
;
for
it
be
not
her
husband
at
the
door
,
but
a
servant
with
a
letter
for
him
,
which
he
deliver
into
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
return
up
-
stair
,
and
say
 
"
It
be
not
your

my
dear

but
I
hope
it
be
one
who
hath
bring
us
some
good
news

<EOS>
"
for
Booth
have
tell
her
that
he
hourly
expect
to
receive
such
from
the
great
man
,
and
have
desire
her
to
open
any
letter

him
in

<EOS>
Amelia
therefore
break
open
the

and
read
as
follow
:
  
"
SIR

<EOS>
after
what
hath
pass
between

,
I
need
only
tell
you
that
I
know
you

this
very
night
alone
with
Miss
Matthews
:
a
fact
which
will
upbraid
you
sufficiently
,
without
put
me
to
that
trouble
,
and
will
very
well
account
for
my
desire
the
favour
of
see
you
to

morrow
in
Hyde

park
at
six
in
the
morning

<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
to
describe
the
agitation
of
Amelia
's
mind
when
she
read
this
letter
.
<EOS>
She
throw
herself
into
her
chair
,
turn
as
pale
as
death
,
begin
to
tremble
all
over
,
and
have
just
power
enough
leave
to
tap
the
bottle
of
wine
,
<EOS>
which
she
have
hitherto
preserve
entire
for
her
husband

and
to
drink
off
a
large
bumper

<EOS>
the
little
boy
perceive
the
strange
symptom
which
appear
in
his
mother
;
and
run
to
her
,
he
cry
,
"

Amelia
answer
,
"
no

"
<EOS>
and
then
a
large
shower
of
tear
come
to
her
assistance
,
which
presently
after
produce
the

in
the
eye

<EOS>
Amelia
,
after
a
short
silence

look
tenderly
at

cry
out

She

at

<EOS>
the
maid

with
a

last
violent
vent

start
up
and
cry

"
I

we
have
none

<EOS>
this
innocent
question
of
the
child
so
sting
Amelia
that
she
have
the
utmost
difficulty
to
prevent
a
relapse
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
take
another
dram
of
wine
;
for
so
it
may
be
call
to
her
,
who
be
the
most
temperate
of

and
never
exceed
three
glass
on
any
occasion

<EOS>
in
this
glass
she
drink
her
child
's
health
,
and
soon
after
so
well
soothe

compose
them
that
they
go
quietly
away
with
Mrs.

<EOS>
the

in
the

indeed
frightful
scene

which
have
present

first
come
into

have
quite
forget

just
at

departure
she
recollect

and
deliver
it
to
Amelia

who
be
no
sooner
alone
than
she
open

and
read
as
follow
:
  
"
my
dearest

sweetest
LOVE

I
write
this
from
the
bailiff

house
where
I
be
formerly
,
and
to
which
I
be
again
bring
at
the
suit
of
that
villain
Trent

<EOS>
I
have
the
misfortune
to
think
I
owe
this
accident
(
I
mean
that
it
happen
to
-
night
)
to
my
own
folly
in
endeavour
to
keep
a
secret
from
you

<EOS>
o
my
dear

<EOS>
have
I
have
resolution
to
confess
my
crime
to
you
,
<EOS>
your
forgiveness
would
,
I
be
convinced
,
have
cost
me
only
a
few
blush
,
and
I
have
now
be
happy
in
your
arm
.
<EOS>
fool
that
I
be
,
to
leave
you
on
such
an
account
,
and
to
add
to
a
former
transgression
a
new
one
!
 
<EOS>
yet
,
by
Heavens
!
<EOS>
I
mean
not
a
transgression
of
the
like
kind
;
for
of
that
I
be
not
nor
ever
will
be
guilty
;
and
when
you
know
the
true
reason
of
my
leave
you
to
-
night
I
think
you
will
pity
rather
than
upbraid
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
would
if
you
know
the
compunction
with
which
I
leave
you
to
go
to
the
most
worthless
,
the
most
infamous
.
<EOS>
do
guess
the
rest
 
guess
that
crime
with
which
I
can
not
stain
my
paper
 
but
still
believe
me
no
more
guilty
than
I
be
,
or
,
if
it
will
lessen
your
vexation
at
what
hath
befall
me
,
believe
me
as
guilty
as
you
please
,
and
think
me
,
for
a
while
at
least
,
as
undeserve
of
you
as
I
think
myself
.
<EOS>
this
paper
and
pen
be
so
bad
<EOS>
,
I
question
whether
you
can
read
what
I
write
:
I
almost
doubt
whether
I
wish
you
should
.
<EOS>
yet
this
I
will
endeavour
to
make
as
legible
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
be
comfort
,
my
dear
love
,
and
still
keep
up
your
spirit
with
the
hope
of
well
day
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
will
be
in
town
to
-
morrow
,
and
I
trust
on
his
goodness
for
my
delivery
once
more
from
this
place
,
and
that
I
shall
soon
be
able
to
repay
him
.
<EOS>
that
Heaven
may
bless
and
preserve
you

the
prayer
of

my

Your

"
  
Amelia
pretty
well
guess
the
obscure
meaning
of
this
letter
,
which
,
though
at
another
time
it
may
have
give
her
unspeakable
torment
,
be
at
present
rather
of
the
medicinal
kind

and
serve
to
allay
her
anguish

Her
anger
to
Booth
too
begin
a
little
to
abate
,
and
be

by

upon

BOOK
XII
.
 
<EOS>
the
book
begin
with
polite
history
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
return
to
the
miserable
couple
,
whom
we
leave
at
the
end
of
the
last
book
,
we
will
give
our
reader
the
more
chearful
view
of
the
gay
and
happy
family
of
Colonel
James
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
James
,
when
she
could
not
,
as
we
have
see
,
prevail
with
Amelia
to
accept
that
invitation
which
,
at
the
desire
of
the
colonel
,
she
have
so
kindly
and
obediently
carry
her
,
return
to
her
husband
and
acquaint
him
with
the
ill
success
of
her
embassy
;
at
which
,
to
say
the
truth
,
she
be
almost
as
much
disappointed
as
the
colonel
himself
;
for
he
have
not
take
a
much
strong
like
to
Amelia
than
she
herself
have
conceive
for
Booth
.
<EOS>
this
will
account
for
some
passage
which
may
have
a
little
surprize
the
reader
in
the
former
chapter
of
this
history
,
as
we
be
not
then
at
leisure
to
communicate
to
them
a
hint
of
this
kind
;
it
be
,
indeed
,
on
Mr.
Booth
's
account
that
she
have
be
at
the
trouble
of
change
her
dress
at
the
masquerade
.
  
<EOS>
but
her
passion
of
this
sort
,
happily
for
her
,
be
not
extremely
strong
;
she
be
therefore
easily
baulk
;
and
,
as
she
meet
with
no
encouragement
from
Booth
,
she
soon
give
way
to
the
impetuosity
of
Miss
Matthews
,
and
from
that
time
scarce
think
more
of
the
affair
till
her
husband
's
design
against
the
wife
revive
her
's
likewise
;
insomuch
that
her
passion
be
at
this
time
certainly
strong
enough
for
Booth
,
to
produce
a
good
hearty
hatred
for
Amelia
,
whom
she
now
abuse
to
the
colonel
in
very
gross
term
,
both
on
the
account
of
her
poverty
and
her
insolence
,
for
<EOS>
so
she
term
the
refusal
of
all
her
offer
.
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
,
see
no
hope
of
soon
possess
his
new
mistress
,
begin
,
like
a
prudent
and
wise
man
,
to
turn
his
thought
towards
the
secure
his
old
one
.
<EOS>
from
what
his
wife
have
mention
concern
the
behaviour
of
the
shepherdess
,
and
particularly
her
preference
of
Booth
,
he
have
little
doubt
but
that
this
be
the
identical
Miss
Matthews
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
therefore
to
watch
her
closely
,
in
hope
of
discover
Booth
's
intrigue
with
her
.
<EOS>
in
this
,
besides
the
remainder
of
affection
which
he
yet
preserve
for
that
lady
,
he
have
another
view
,
as
it
would
give
him
a
fair
pretence
to
quarrel
with
Booth
;
who
,
by
carry
on
this
intrigue
,
would
have
break
his
word
and
honour
give
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
he
begin
now
to
hate
poor
Booth
heartily
,
from
the
same
reason
from
which
Mrs.
James
have
contract
her
aversion
to
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
the
colonel
therefore
employ
an
inferior
kind
of
pimp
to
watch
the
lodging
of
Miss
Matthews
,
and
to
acquaint
him
if
Booth
,
whose
person
be
know
to
the
pimp
,
make
any
visit
there
.
  
<EOS>
the
pimp
faithfully
perform
his
office
,
and
,
have
last
night
make
the
wish
-
for
discovery
,
immediately
acquaint
his
master
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
news
the
colonel
presently
despatch
to
Booth
the
short
note
which
we
have
before
see
.
<EOS>
He
send
it
to
his
own
house
instead
of
Miss
Matthews
's
,
with
hope
of
that
very
accident
which
actually
do
happen
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
have
any
ingredient
of
the
bully
in
him
,
and
desire
to
be
prevent
from
fight
,
but
with
a
prospect
of
injure
Booth
in
the
affection
and
esteem
of
Amelia
,
and
of
recommend
himself
somewhat
to
her
by
appear
in
the
light
of
her
champion
;
for
which
purpose
he
add
that
compliment
to
Amelia
in
his
letter
.
<EOS>
He
conclude
upon
the
whole
that
,
if
Booth
himself
open
the
letter
,
he
would
certainly
meet
him
the
next
morning
;
but
if
his
wife
should
open
it
before
he
come
home
it
may
have
the
effect
before
mention
;
and
,
for
his
future
expostulation
with
Booth
,
it
would
not
be
in
Amelia
's
power
to
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
it
happen
that
this
pimp
have
more
master
than
one
.
<EOS>
amongst
these
be
the
worthy
Mr.
Trent
,
for
whom
he
have
often
do
business
of
the
pimping
vocation
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
employ
indeed
in
the
service
of
the
great
peer
himself
,
under
the
direction
of
the
say
Trent
,
and
be
the
very
person
who
have
assist
the
say
trent
in
dog
Booth
and
his
wife
to
the
opera
-
house
on
the
masquerade
night
.
  
<EOS>
this
subaltern
pimp
be
with
his
superior
Trent
yesterday
morning
,
when
he
find
a
bailiff
with
him
in
order
to
receive
his
instruction
for
the
arresting
Booth
,
when
the
bailiff
say
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
matter
to
take
him
,
for
that
to
his
knowledge
he
be
as
shy
a
cock
as
any
in
England
.
<EOS>
the
subaltern
immediately
acquaint
Trent
with
the
business
in
which
he
be
employ
by
the
colonel
;
upon
which
Trent
enjoin
him
the
moment
he
have
set
him
to
give
immediate
notice
to
the
bailiff
,
which
he
agree
to
,
and
perform
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
the
bailiff
,
on
receive
the
notice
,
immediately
set
out
for
his
stand
at
an
alehouse
within
three
door
of
Miss
Matthews
's
lodging
;
at
which
,
unfortunately
for
poor
Booth
,
he
arrive
a
very
few
minute
before
Booth
leave
that
lady
in
order
to
return
to
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
several
matter
of
which
we
think
necessary
our
reader
should
be
inform
;
for
,
besides
that
it
conduce
greatly
to
a
perfect
understanding
of
all
history
,
there
be
no
exercise
of
the
mind
of
a
sensible
reader
more
pleasant
than
the
tracing
the
several
small
and
almost
imperceptible
link
in
every
chain
of
event
by
which
all
the
great
action
of
the
world
be
produce
.
<EOS>
We
will
now
in
the
next
chapter
proceed
with
our
history
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Amelia
visit
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
,
after
much
anxious
thinking
,
in
which
she
sometimes
flatter
herself
that
her
husband
be
less
guilty
than
she
have
at
first
imagine
him
,
and
that
he
have
some
good
excuse
to
make
for
himself
(
for
,
indeed
,
she
be
not
so
able
as
willing
to
make
one
for
him
)
,
at
length
resolve
to
set
out
for
the
bailiff
's
castle
.
<EOS>
have
therefore
strictly
recommend
the
care
of
her
child
to
her
good
landlady
,
she
send
for
a
hackney
coach
,
and
order
the
coachman
to
drive
to
Gray's
-
inn
-
lane
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
come
to
the
house
,
and
ask
for
the
captain
,
the
bailiff
's
wife
,
who
come
to
the
door
,
guess
,
by
the
greatness
of
her
beauty
and
the
disorder
of
her
dress
,
that
she
be
a
young
lady
of
pleasure
,
answer
surlily
,
"
captain
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
of
any
captain
that
be
here
,
not
I
!
"
<EOS>
for
this
good
woman
be
,
as
well
as
dame
Purgante
in
Prior
,
a
bitter
enemy
to
all
whore
,
especially
to
those
of
the
handsome
kind
;
for
some
such
she
suspect
to
go
share
with
her
in
a
certain
property
to
which
the
law
give
her
the
sole
right
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
reply
she
be
certain
that
Captain
Booth
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
if
he
be
so
,
"
cry
the
bailiff
's
wife
,
"
you
may
come
into
the
kitchen
if
you
will
,
and
he
shall
be
call
down
to
you
if
you
have
any
business
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
she
mutter
something
to
herself
,
and
conclude
a
little
more
intelligibly
,
though
still
in
a
muttering
voice
,
that
she
keep
no
such
house
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
whose
innocence
give
her
no
suspicion
of
the
true
cause
of
this
good
woman
's
sullenness
,
be
frightened
,
and
begin
to
fear
she
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
make
a
shift
to
totter
into
the
kitchen
,
when
the
mistress
of
the
house
ask
her
,
"
well
,
madam
,
who
shall
I
tell
the
captain
want
to
speak
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
madam
,
"
cry
Amelia
;
"
in
my
confusion
I
really
forget
you
do
not
know
me
 
<EOS>
tell
him
,
if
you
please
,
that
I
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
be
indeed
his
wife
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
cry
Mrs.
Bailiff
,
a
little
softened
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
,
and
upon
my
honour
,
"
answer
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
this
be
the
case
,
"
cry
the
other
,
"
you
may
walk
up
-
stair
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
part
man
and
wife
!
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
think
they
can
never
be
too
much
together
.
<EOS>
but
I
never
will
suffer
any
bad
doing
in
my
house
,
nor
any
of
the
town
lady
to
come
to
gentleman
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
answer
that
she
like
her
the
well
:
for
,
indeed
,
in
her
present
disposition
,
Amelia
be
as
much
exasperate
against
wicked
woman
as
the
virtuous
mistress
of
the
house
,
or
any
other
virtuous
woman
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
bailiff
's
wife
then
usher
Amelia
up
-
stair
,
and
,
have
unlock
the
prisoner
's
door
,
cry
,
"
captain
,
here
be
your
lady
,
sir
,
come
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
Booth
start
up
from
his
chair
,
and
catch
Amelia
in
his
arm
,
embrace
her
for
a
considerable
time
with
so
much
rapture
,
that
the
bailiff
's
wife
,
who
be
an
eyewitness
of
this
violent
fondness
,
begin
to
suspect
whether
Amelia
have
really
tell
her
truth
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
have
some
little
awe
of
the
captain
;
and
for
fear
of
be
in
the
wrong
do
not
interfere
,
but
shut
the
door
and
turn
the
key
.
  
<EOS>
when
Booth
find
himself
alone
with
his
wife
,
and
have
vent
the
first
violence
of
his
rapture
in
kiss
and
embrace
,
he
look
tenderly
at
her
and
cry
,
"
be
it
possible
,
Amelia
,
be
it
possible
you
can
have
this
goodness
to
follow
such
a
wretch
as
me
to
such
a
place
as
this
 
or
<EOS>
do
you
come
to
upbraid
me
with
my
guilt
,
and
to
sink
me
down
to
that
perdition
I
so
justly
deserve
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
so
give
to
upbraid
then
?
"
say
she
,
in
a
gentle
voice
;
"
have
I
ever
give
you
occasion
to
think
I
would
sink
you
to
perdition
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
far
be
it
from
me
,
my
love
,
to
think
so
,
"
answer
he
.
"
<EOS>
and
yet
you
may
forgive
the
utmost
fear
of
an
offending
,
penitent
sinner
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
indeed
,
the
extent
of
your
goodness
,
<EOS>
and
yet
I
know
my
guilt
<EOS>
so
great
<EOS>
"
  
"
alas
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
,
"
say
she
,
"
what
guilt
be
this
which
you
mention
,
and
which
you
writ
to
me
of
last
night
?
 
<EOS>
sure
,
by
your
mentioning
to
me
so
much
,
you
intend
to
tell
me
more
 
nay
,
indeed
,
to
tell
me
all
;
and
not
leave
my
mind
open
to
suspicion
perhaps
ten
time
bad
than
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
a
patient
hearing
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
indeed
,
"
answer
she
,
"
nay
,
I
be
prepared
to
hear
the
bad
you
can
unfold
;
nay
,
perhaps
,
the
bad
be
short
of
my
apprehension
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
then
,
after
a
little
further
apology
,
begin
and
relate
to
her
the
whole
that
have
pass
between
him
and
Miss
Matthews
,
from
their
first
meeting
in
the
prison
to
their
separation
the
precede
evening
.
<EOS>
all
which
,
as
the
reader
know
it
already
,
it
would
be
tedious
and
unpardonable
to
transcribe
from
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
tell
her
likewise
all
that
he
have
do
and
suffer
to
conceal
his
transgression
from
her
knowledge
.
<EOS>
this
he
assure
her
be
the
business
of
his
visit
last
night
,
the
consequence
of
which
be
,
he
declare
in
the
most
solemn
manner
,
no
other
than
an
absolute
quarrel
with
Miss
Matthews
,
of
whom
he
have
take
a
final
leave
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
end
his
narration
,
Amelia
,
after
a
short
silence
,
answer
,
"
indeed
,
I
firmly
believe
every
word
you
have
say
,
but
I
can
not
now
forgive
you
the
fault
you
have
confess
;
and
my
reason
be
  
b
ecause
I
have
forgive
it
long
ago
.
<EOS>
here
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
be
an
instance
that
I
be
likewise
capable
of
keep
a
secret
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
then
deliver
her
husband
a
letter
which
she
have
some
time
ago
receive
from
Miss
Matthews
,
and
which
be
the
same
which
that
lady
have
mention
,
and
suppose
,
as
Booth
have
never
hear
of
it
,
that
it
have
miscarry
;
for
she
send
it
by
the
penny
post
.
<EOS>
in
this
letter
,
which
be
sign
by
a
feign
name
,
she
have
acquaint
Amelia
with
the
infidelity
of
her
husband
,
and
have
besides
very
greatly
abuse
him
;
tax
him
with
many
falsehood
,
and
,
among
the
rest
,
with
have
speak
very
slightingly
and
disrespectfully
of
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
never
shine
forth
to
Booth
in
so
amiable
and
great
a
light
;
nor
do
his
own
unworthiness
ever
appear
to
him
so
mean
and
contemptible
as
at
this
instant
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
he
have
read
the
letter
,
he
utter
many
violent
protestation
to
her
,
that
all
which
relate
to
herself
be
absolutely
false
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
convince
it
be
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
have
a
suspicion
of
the
contrary
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
have
,
till
last
night
revive
it
in
my
memory
,
almost
forget
the
letter
;
for
,
as
I
well
know
from
whom
it
come
,
by
her
mention
obligation
which
she
have
confer
on
you
,
and
<EOS>
which
you
have
more
than
once
speak
to
me
of
<EOS>
,
I
make
large
allowance
for
the
situation
you
be
then
in
;
and
I
be
the
more
satisfied
,
as
the
letter
itself
,
as
well
as
many
other
circumstance
,
convince
me
the
affair
be
at
an
end
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
now
utter
the
most
extravagant
expression
of
admiration
and
fondness
that
his
heart
could
dictate
,
and
accompany
them
with
the
warm
embrace
.
<EOS>
all
which
warmth
and
tenderness
she
return
;
and
tear
of
love
and
joy
gush
from
both
their
eye
.
<EOS>
so
ravish
indeed
be
their
heart
,
that
for
some
time
they
both
forget
the
dreadful
situation
of
their
affair
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
but
a
short
reverie
.
<EOS>
It
soon
recur
to
Amelia
,
that
,
though
she
have
the
liberty
of
leave
that
house
when
she
please
,
she
could
not
take
her
beloved
husband
with
her
.
<EOS>
this
thought
sting
her
tender
bosom
to
the
quick
,
and
she
could
not
so
far
command
herself
as
to
refrain
from
many
sorrowful
exclamation
against
the
hardship
of
their
destiny
;
<EOS>
but
when
she
see
the
effect
they
have
upon
Booth
she
stifle
her
rise
grief
,
force
a
little
chearfulness
into
her
countenance
,
and
,
exert
all
the
spirit
she
could
raise
within
herself
,
express
her
hope
of
see
a
speedy
end
to
their
suffering
.
<EOS>
She
then
ask
her
husband
what
she
should
do
for
him
,
and
to
whom
she
should
apply
for
his
deliverance
?
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
my
dear
,
"
cry
Booth
,
"
that
the
doctor
be
to
be
in
town
some
time
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
My
hope
of
immediate
redemption
be
only
in
him
;
and
,
if
that
can
be
obtain
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
of
the
success
of
that
affair
which
be
in
the
hand
of
a
gentleman
who
hath
faithfully
promise
,
and
in
whose
power
I
be
so
well
assure
it
be
to
serve
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
do
this
poor
man
support
his
hope
by
a
dependence
on
that
ticket
which
he
have
so
dearly
purchase
of
one
who
pretend
to
manage
the
wheel
in
the
great
state
lottery
of
preferment
.
<EOS>
a
lottery
,
indeed
,
which
hath
this
to
recommend
it
 
that
many
poor
wretch
feed
their
imagination
with
the
prospect
of
a
prize
during
their
whole
life
,
and
never
discover
they
have
draw
a
blank
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
who
be
of
a
pretty
sanguine
temper
,
and
be
entirely
ignorant
of
these
matter
,
be
full
as
easy
to
be
deceive
into
hope
as
her
husband
;
but
in
reality
at
present
she
turn
her
eye
to
no
distant
prospect
,
the
desire
of
regain
her
husband
's
liberty
have
engross
her
whole
mind
.
  
<EOS>
while
they
be
discourse
on
these
matter
they
hear
a
violent
noise
in
the
house
,
and
immediately
after
several
person
pass
by
their
door
up
-
stair
to
the
apartment
over
their
head
.
<EOS>
this
greatly
terrify
the
gentle
spirit
of
Amelia
,
and
she
cry
 
"
Good
Heavens
,
my
dear
,
must
I
leave
you
in
this
horrid
place
?
<EOS>
I
be
terrified
with
a
thousand
fear
concern
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
endeavour
to
comfort
her
,
say
that
he
be
in
no
manner
of
danger
,
and
that
he
doubt
not
but
that
the
doctor
would
soon
be
with
him
 
"
and
stay
,
my
dear
<EOS>
,
"
cry
he
;
"
now
I
recollect
,
suppose
you
should
apply
to
my
old
friend
James
;
for
I
believe
you
be
pretty
well
satisfied
that
your
apprehension
of
him
be
groundless
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
reason
to
think
but
that
he
would
be
as
ready
to
serve
me
as
formerly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
turn
pale
as
ashe
at
the
name
of
James
,
and
,
instead
of
make
a
direct
answer
to
her
husband
,
she
lay
hold
of
him
,
and
cry
,
"
My
dear
,
I
have
one
favour
to
beg
of
you
,
and
I
insist
on
your
grant
it
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
readily
swear
he
would
deny
her
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
this
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
,
if
that
detest
colonel
come
,
you
will
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
let
the
people
of
the
house
tell
him
you
be
not
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
know
nothing
of
my
be
here
,
"
answer
Booth
;
"
but
why
should
I
refuse
to
see
him
if
he
should
be
kind
enough
to
come
hither
to
me
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
Amelia
,
you
have
take
a
dislike
to
that
man
without
sufficient
reason
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
speak
not
upon
that
account
,
"
cry
Amelia
;
"
but
I
have
have
dream
last
night
about
you
two
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
laugh
at
my
folly
,
but
pray
indulge
it
.
<EOS>
nay
,
I
insist
on
your
promise
of
not
deny
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
dream
!
<EOS>
my
dear
creature
,
"
answer
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
dream
can
you
have
have
of
us
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
too
horrible
to
be
mention
,
"
reply
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
of
it
without
horrour
;
and
,
unless
you
will
promise
me
not
to
see
the
colonel
till
I
return
,
I
positively
will
never
leave
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
my
Amelia
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
I
never
know
you
unreasonable
before
.
<EOS>
how
can
a
woman
of
your
sense
talk
of
dream
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
suffer
me
to
be
once
at
least
unreasonable
,
"
say
Amelia
,
"
as
you
be
so
good
-
natured
to
say
I
be
not
often
so
.
<EOS>
consider
what
I
have
lately
suffer
,
and
how
weak
my
spirit
must
be
at
this
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
Booth
be
go
to
speak
,
the
bailiff
,
without
any
ceremony
,
enter
the
room
,
and
cry
,
"
no
offence
,
I
hope
,
madam
;
my
wife
<EOS>
,
it
seem
,
do
not
know
you
.
<EOS>
She
think
the
captain
have
a
mind
for
a
bit
of
flesh
by
the
bye
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
quiet
all
matter
;
for
I
know
you
very
well
:
I
have
see
that
handsome
face
many
a
time
when
I
have
be
wait
upon
the
captain
formerly
.
<EOS>
no
offence
,
I
hope
,
madam
;
but
if
my
wife
be
as
handsome
as
you
be
<EOS>
I
should
not
look
for
bad
good
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
conceive
some
displeasure
at
this
speech
,
but
he
do
not
think
proper
to
express
more
than
a
pish
;
and
then
ask
the
bailiff
what
be
the
meaning
of
the
noise
they
hear
just
now
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
of
no
noise
,
"
answer
the
bailiff
.
<EOS>
"
some
of
my
man
have
be
carry
a
piece
of
bad
luggage
up
-
stair
;
a
poor
rascal
that
resist
the
law
and
justice
;
so
I
give
him
a
cut
or
two
with
a
hanger
.
<EOS>
if
they
should
prove
mortal
,
he
must
thank
himself
for
it
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
will
not
behave
like
a
gentleman
to
an
officer
,
he
must
take
the
consequence
;
but
I
must
say
that
for
you
,
captain
,
you
behave
yourself
like
a
gentleman
,
and
therefore
I
shall
always
use
you
as
such
;
and
I
hope
you
will
find
bail
soon
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
this
be
but
a
paultry
sum
to
what
the
last
be
;
and
I
do
assure
you
there
be
nothing
else
against
you
in
the
office
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
latter
part
of
the
bailiff
's
speech
somewhat
comfort
Amelia
,
who
have
be
a
little
frightened
by
the
former
;
and
<EOS>
she
soon
after
take
leave
of
her
husband
to
go
in
quest
of
the
doctor
,
who
,
as
Amelia
have
hear
that
morning
,
be
expect
in
town
that
very
day
,
which
be
somewhat
soon
than
he
have
intend
at
his
departure
.
  
<EOS>
before
she
go
,
however
,
she
leave
a
strict
charge
with
the
bailiff
,
who
usher
her
very
civilly
downstairs
,
that
if
one
Colonel
James
come
there
to
enquire
for
her
husband
he
should
deny
that
he
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
She
then
depart
;
and
the
bailiff
immediately
give
a
very
strict
charge
to
his
wife
,
his
maid
,
and
his
follower
,
that
if
one
Colonel
James
,
or
any
one
from
him
,
should
enquire
after
the
captain
,
that
they
should
let
him
know
he
have
the
captain
above
-
stair
;
for
he
doubt
not
but
that
the
colonel
be
one
of
Booth
's
creditor
,
and
he
hope
for
a
second
bail
-
bond
by
his
mean
.
    
<EOS>
contain
matter
pertinent
to
the
history
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
,
in
her
way
to
the
doctor
's
,
determine
just
to
stop
at
her
own
lodging
,
which
lie
a
little
out
of
the
road
,
and
to
pay
a
momentary
visit
to
her
child
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
fortunate
enough
;
for
,
have
she
call
at
the
doctor
's
house
,
she
would
have
hear
nothing
of
him
,
which
would
have
cause
in
her
some
alarm
and
disappointment
;
for
the
doctor
be
set
down
at
Mrs.
Atkinson
's
,
where
he
be
direct
to
Amelia
's
lodging
,
to
which
he
go
before
he
call
at
his
own
;
and
here
Amelia
now
find
him
play
with
her
two
child
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
be
a
little
surprized
at
not
find
Amelia
at
home
,
or
any
one
that
could
give
an
account
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
more
surprized
to
see
her
come
in
such
a
dress
,
and
at
the
disorder
which
he
very
plainly
perceive
in
her
pale
and
melancholy
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
address
her
first
(
for
indeed
she
be
in
no
great
haste
to
speak
)
,
and
cry
,
"
My
dear
child
,
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
where
be
your
husband
?
<EOS>
some
mischief
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
hath
happen
to
him
in
my
absence

"
  
"
<EOS>
o
my

answer
Amelia
,
"
sure
some
good
angel
hath
send
you
hither
.
<EOS>
My
poor
Will
be
arrest
again
.
<EOS>
I
leave
him
in
the
most
miserable
condition
in
the
very
house
<EOS>
whence
your
goodness
formerly
redeem
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
arrest
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
then
it
must
be
for
some
very
inconsiderable
trifle
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
be
,
"
say
Amelia
;
"
but
it
be
for
no
less
than
fifty
pound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
cry
the
doctor
,
"
he
hath
be
disingenuous
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
do
not
owe
ten
pound
in
the
world
for
which
he
be
liable
to
be
sue
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
to
say
,
"
cry
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
afraid
to
tell
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
,
child
?
"
say
the
doctor
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
never
disguise
it
to
any
one
,
especially
to
me
.
<EOS>
any
prevarication
,
I
promise
you
,
will
forfeit
my
friendship
for
ever

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
the
whole
,
"
cry
Amelia
,
"
and
rely
entirely
on
your
goodness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
relate
the
gaming
story
,
not
forget
to
set
in
the
full
light
,
and
to
lay
the
strong
emphasis
on
,
his
promise
never
to
play
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
fetch
a
deep
sigh
when
he
have
hear
Amelia
's
relation
,
and
cry
,
"
I
be
sorry
,
child
,
for
the
share
you
be
to
partake
in
your
husband
's
suffering
;
but
as
for
him
,
I
really
think
he
deserve
no
compassion
.
<EOS>
You
say
he
hath
promise
never
to
play
again
,
but
I
must
tell
you
he
hath
break
his
promise
to
me
already
;
for
I
have
hear
he
be
formerly
addict
to
this
vice
,
and
have
give
him
sufficient
caution
against
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
consider
,
child
,
I
be
already
pretty
largely
engage
for
him
,
every
farthing
of
which
I
be
sensible
I
must
pay
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
would
go
to
the
utmost
verge
of
prudence
to
serve
you
;
but
I
must
not
exceed
my
ability
,
which
be
not
very
great
;
and
I
have
several
family
on
my
hand
who
be
by
misfortune
alone
bring
to
want
.
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
I
can
not
at
present
answer
for
such
a
sum
as
this
without
distress
my

then
Heaven
have
mercy
upon
us
all
!

cry
Amelia
,
"
<EOS>
for
we
have
no
other
friend
on
earth
:
my
husband
be
undone
,
and
these
poor
little
wretch
must
be
starve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
cast
his
eye
on
the
child
,
and
then
cry
,
"
I
hope
not
so
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
must
distress
my
circumstance

I
will
distress
them
this
once
on
your
account
,
and
on
the
account
of
these
poor
little
babe
.
<EOS>
but
thing
must
not
go
on
any
longer
in
this
way

<EOS>
You
must
take
an
heroic
resolution
.
<EOS>
I
will
hire
a
coach
for
you
to
-
morrow
morning
which
shall
carry
you
all
down
to
my
parsonage
-
house
.
<EOS>
there
you
shall
have
my
protection
till
something
can
be
do
for
your
husband
;
of
which
,
to
be
plain
with
you
,
I
at
present
see
no
likelihood

"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
fall
upon
her
knee
in
an
ecstasy
of
thanksgiving
to
the
doctor
,
who
immediately
raise
her
up
,
and
place
her
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
She
then
recollect
herself
,
and
say
,
"
o
my
worthy
friend
,
I
have
still
another
matter
to
mention
to
you

I
must
have
both
your
advice
and
assistance

<EOS>
My
soul
blush
to
give
you
all
this
trouble

but
what
other
friend
have
I
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
what
other
friend
could
I
apply
to
so
properly
on
such
an
occasion

<EOS>
the
doctor
,
with
a
very
kind
voice
and
countenance
,
desire
her
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
then
say
,
"
o
sir

<EOS>
that
wicked
colonel
whom
I
have
mention
to
you
formerly
hath
pick
some
quarrel
with
my

for
she
do
not

hath
send
him
a
challenge

It
come

last
night

She
answer
she
have
burn
it

as
be
indeed
true

"
<EOS>
but
I
remember
it
be
an
appointment
to
meet
with
sword

pistol
this
morning
at
Hyde-
park

"
  
<EOS>
"
make
yourself
easy

Can
honour

found
on
false
principle
of
virtue

in
direct
opposition
to
the
plain

positive
precept

villany

<EOS>
"
all
this
,
I
believe
,
be
very
true

Amelia

yet
you

the
opinion

You
talk

you
be
in
the
wrong

<EOS>
It
be
not
the
opinion

it
be
the
opinion

the
idle

ignorant

profligate

It

impossible
it
should
be
the
opinion

one
man

be
in

in
his
belief
of
our
religion

<EOS>
chiefly
,
indeed
,
it
hath
be
uphold
by
the
nonsense
of
woman

who
,
either
from
their
extreme
cowardice
and
desire
of
protection
,
or
,
as
Mr.
Bayle
think
,
from
their
excessive
vanity
,
have
be
always
forward
to
countenance
a
set
of
hector
and
bravo
,
and
to
despise
all
man
of
modesty

sobriety
;
though
these
be
often

at
the
bottom

not

the
well

the
braver
man

<EOS>
"
You
know

Amelia

"
I
have
never

a

indeed
,
child

cry
the
doctor
,
"
I
know
you
be
a
good

yet
I
must
observe
to
you
,
that
this
very
desire
of
feed
the
passion
of
female
vanity
with
the
heroism
of
her
man
,
old
Homer

to
make
the
characteristic

leave
her

only
because
he
be

duellist

in

he
represent
the

<EOS>
this
be
indeed
a
weakness

it
be
an
amiable
one

and
become
the
true
feminine
character
;
but
a
woman
who
,
out
of
heroic
vanity
(
for
so
it
be
)
,
would
hazard
not
only
the
life
but
the
soul
too
of
her
husband
in
a

monster

paint
in
no

that
of

I

I
never

odious

I
be
ashamed
to
recollect
what
I

yet
,
whilst
the

one
would
wish
to
comply
as
far
as
possible

as
my

be
an
officer
of
the

therefore
,
with
safety

the

indeed
I

not
suffer

basely

barbarously

know
it
a

the
next
time
you
see
your

ask
her
what
it
be

fall
in
love

"
Nay
,
dear
sir

Amelia

do
not

me
so
unmercifully

think
where

answer
the

where
I
will
presently
be
with

<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
do
you
pack
up
everything
in
order
for
your
journey
to

morrow

for
if
you
be
wise
,
you
will
not
trust
your
husband
a
day
longer
in
this
town
 
therefore
to
pack
.

<EOS>
Amelia
promise
she
would
,
though
indeed
she
want
not
any
warning
for
her
journey
on
this
account
;
for
when
she
pack
up
herself
in
the
coach
,
she
pack
up
her
all
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
do
not
think
proper
to
mention
this
to
the
doctor
;
for
,
as
he
be
now
in
pretty
good
humour
,
she
do
not
care
to
venture
again
discompose
his
temper
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
then
set
out
for
Gray's
-
inn
-
lane
,
and
,
as
soon
as
he
be
go
,
Amelia
begin
to
consider
of
her
incapacity
to
take
a
journey
in
her
present
situation
without
even
a
clean
shift
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
resolve
,
as
she
be
possess
of
seven
guinea
and
a
half
,
to
go
to
her
friend
and
redeem
some
of
her
own
and
her
husband
's
linen
out
of
captivity
;
indeed
just
so
much
as
would
render
it
barely
possible
for
them
to
go
out
of
town
with
any
kind
of
decency
.
<EOS>
and
this
resolution
she
immediately
execute
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
have
finish
her
business
with
the
pawnbroker
(
if
a
man
who
lend
under
thirty
per
cent
.
<EOS>
deserve
that
name
)
<EOS>
,
he
say
to
her
,
"
Pray
,
madam
,
do
you
know
that
man
who
be
here
yesterday
when
you
bring
the
picture
?
"
<EOS>
Amelia
answer
in
the
negative
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
madam
,
"
say
the
broker
,
"
he
know
you
,
though
he
do
not
recollect
you
while
you
be
here
,
as
your
hood
be
draw
over
your
face
;
but
the
moment
you
be
go
he
beg
to
look
at
the
picture
,
which
I
,
think
no
harm
,
permit
.
<EOS>
He
have
scarce
look
upon
it
when
he
cry
out
,
"
by
heaven
and
earth
<EOS>
it
be
her
picture
!
"
<EOS>
He
then
ask
me
if
I
know
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
never
see
the
lady
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
this
last
particular
,
however
,
the
pawnbroker
a
little
savour
of
his
profession
,
and
make
a
small
deviation
from
the
truth
,
for
,
when
the
man
have
ask
him
if
he
know
the
lady
,
he
answer
she
be
some
poor
undone
woman
who
have
pawn
all
her
cloathe
to
him
the
day
before
;
and
I
suppose
,
say
he
,
this
picture
be
the
last
of
her
good
and
chattel
.
<EOS>
this
hint
we
think
proper
to
give
the
reader
,
as
it
may
chance
to
be
material
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
answer
coldly
that
she
have
take
so
very
little
notice
of
the
man
that
she
scarce
remember
he
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
madam
,
"
say
the
pawnbroker
,
"
he
hath
take
very
great
notice
of
you
;
for
the
man
change
countenance
upon
what
I
say
,
and
presently
after
beg
me
to
give
him
a
dram
.
<EOS>
Oho
!
<EOS>
think
I
to
myself
,
be
you
thereabout
?
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
so
much
in
love
with
some
folk
as
some
people
be
for
more
interest
than
I
shall
ever
make
of
a
thousand
pound
.
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
blush
,
and
say
,
with
some
peevishness
,
"
that
she
know
nothing
of
the
man
,
but
suppose
he
be
some
impertinent
fellow
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
madam
,
"
answer
the
pawnbroker
,
"
I
assure
you
he
be
not
worthy
your
regard

<EOS>
He
be
a
poor
wretch
,

I
believe
I
be
possess
of
most
of
his
moveable
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
hope
you
be
not
offend
,
for
indeed
he
say
no
harm
;
but
he
be
very
strangely
disorder
,
that
be
the
truth
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
be
very
desirous
of
put
an
end
to
this
conversation
,
and
altogether
as
eager
to
return
to
her
child
;
she
therefore
bundle
up
her
thing
as
fast
as
she
could
,
and
,
call
for
a
hackney
-
coach
,
direct
the
coachman
to
her
lodging
,
and
bid
him
drive
her
home
with
all
the
haste
he
could
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Dr
Harrison
visit
Colonel
James
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
when
he
leave
Amelia
,
intend
to
go
directly
to
Booth
,
but
he
presently
change
his
mind
,
and
determine
first
to
call
on
the
colonel
,
as
he
think
it
be
proper
to
put
an
end
to
that
matter
before
he
give
Booth
his
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
find
the
two
colonel
,
James
and
Bath
,
together
.
<EOS>
They
both
receive
him
very
civilly
,
for
James
be
a
very
well
-
breed
man
,
and
Bath
always
shew
a
particular
respect
to
the
clergy
<EOS>
,
he
be
indeed
a
perfect
good
Christian
,
except
in
the
article
of
fighting
and
swearing
.
  
<EOS>
Our
divine
sit
some
time
without
mention
the
subject
of
his
errand
,
in
hope
that
Bath
would
go
away
,
but
when
he
find
no
likelihood
of
that
(
for
indeed
Bath
be
of
the
two
much
the
most
pleased
with
his
company
)
,
he
tell
James
that
he
have
something
to
say
to
him
relate
to
Mr.
Booth
,
which
he
believe
he
may
speak
before
his
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
undoubtedly
,
sir
,
"
say
James
;
"
for
there
can
be
no
secret
between
us
which
my

may
not
hear

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
then
to
you

the
doctor

the
most
unhappy

I

great
reason

Bath
,
"
you
say
right
;

I
think
this
gentleman
may
call
you
to
an
account
;
nay
,
I
think
it
be
his
duty
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
and
let
me
tell
you
,
brother
,
there
be
one
much
great
than
he
to

you
must
give
an
account

<EOS>
Mrs.
Booth
be
really
a
fine
woman
,
a
lady
of
most
imperious
and
majestic
presence
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
you
often
say
that
you
like
her
;
and
,
if
you
have
quarrel
with
her
husband
upon
this
account
,
by
all
the
dignity
of
man
I
think
you
ought
to
ask
his
pardon

Bath

"
angry
!
 
<EOS>
I
love
you

have
obligation

<EOS>
I
will
say
no

I

you

I
do
not

make
any
man
angry

"
  
<EOS>
James
answer
he
know
it
well
;
and
then
the
doctor
,
apprehend
that
while
he
be
stop
up
one
breach
he
should
make
another
,
presently
interfere
,
and
turn
the
discourse
back
to
Booth

<EOS>
"
You
tell
me
,
sir
,
"
say
he
to
James
,
"
that
my
gown
be
my
protection
;
let
it
then
at
least
protect
me
where
I
have
have
no
design
in
offend
 
where
I
have
consult
your
high
welfare
,
as
in
truth
I
do
in
write
this
letter

<EOS>
and
if
you
do
not
in
the

deserve
any
such
suspicion
,
still
you
have
no
cause
for
resentment

<EOS>
caution
against
sin
,
even
to
the
innocent
,
can
never
be
unwholesome
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
assure
you
,
whatever
anger
you
have
to
me
,
you
can
have
none
to
poor
Booth
,
who
be
entirely
ignorant
of
my
writing
to
you

and
who
<EOS>
,
I
be
certain
,
never
entertain
the

suspicion
of
you

on
the
contrary
,
revere
you
with
the
high
esteem
,
and
love

gratitude

<EOS>
let
me
therefore
reconcile
all
matter
between
you

bring
you
together
before
he
hath
even
hear
of
this
challenge

<EOS>
"
brother
,
"

Bath
,
"
I
hope
I
shall
not
make
you
angry
 
<EOS>
I
lie
when
I
say
so
;
for
I
be
indifferent
to
any
man
's
anger

<EOS>
let
me
be
an
accessory
to
what
the

hath
say

<EOS>
I
think
I
may
be
trust
with
matter
of
this
nature
,
and
it
be
a
little
unkind
that
,
if
you
intend
to
send
a
challenge
,
you
do
not
make
me
the
bearer
.
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
as
to
what
appear
to
me
,
this
matter
may
be
very
well
make
up
;
and
,
as
Mr.
Booth
doth
not
know
of
the
challenge
,
I
do
not
see
why
he
ever
should
,
any
more
than
your
give
him
the
lie
just
now
;
but
that
he
shall
never
have
from
me
,
nor
,
I
believe
,
from
this
gentleman
;
for
,
indeed
,
if
he
should
,
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
him
to
cut
your
throat

<EOS>
"
  
"
Lookee
,
doctor
,
"
say
James
,
"
I
do
not
deserve
the
unkind
suspicion
you
just
now
throw
out
against

<EOS>
I
never
thirst
after
any
man
's
blood
;
and
,
as
for
what
hath
pass
,
since
this
discovery
hath
happen
,
I
may
,
perhaps
,
not
think
it
worth
my
while
to
trouble
myself
any
more
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
not
content
with
perhaps
,
he
insist
on
a
firm
promise
,
to
be
bind
with
the
colonel
's
honour
.
<EOS>
this
at
length
he
obtain
,
and
then
depart
well
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
colonel
be
ashamed
to
avow
the
real
cause
of
the
quarrel
to
this
good
man
,
or
,
indeed
,
to
his
brother
Bath
,
who
would
not
only
have
condemn
him
equally
with
the
doctor
,
but
would
possibly
have
quarrel
with
him
on
his
sister
's
account
,
whom
,
as
the
reader
must
have
observe
,
he
love
above
all
thing
;
and
,
in
plain
truth
,
though
the
colonel
be
a
brave
man
,
and
dare
to
fight
,
yet
he
be
altogether
as
willing
to
let
it
alone
;
and
this
make
him
now
and
then
give
a
little
way
to
the
wrongheadedness
of
Colonel
Bath
,
who
,
with
all
the
other
principle
of
honour
and
humanity
,
make
no
more
of
cut
the
throat
of
a
man
upon
any
of
his
punctilio
than
a
butcher
doth
of
kill
sheep
.
    
<EOS>
what
pass
at
the
bailiff
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
now
set
forwards
to
his
friend
Booth
,
and
,
as
he
past
by
the
door
of
his
attorney
in
the
way
,
he
call
upon
him
and
take
him
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
meeting
between
him
and
Booth
nee
not
be
expatiate
on
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
really
angry
,
and
,
though
he
defer
his
lecture
to
a
more
proper
opportunity
,
yet
,
as
he
be
no
dissembler
(
indeed
,
he
be
incapable
of
any
disguise
)
,
he
could
not
put
on
a
show
of
that
heartiness
with
which
he
have
formerly
use
to
receive
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
at
last
begin
himself
in
the
follow
manner
:
"
Doctor
,
I
be
really
ashamed
to
see
you
;
and
,
if
you
know
the
confusion
of
my
soul
on
this
occasion
,
I
be
sure
you
would
pity
rather
than
upbraid
me
;
and
yet
I
can
say
with
great
sincerity
I
rejoice
in
this
last
instance
of
my
shame
,
since
I
be
like
to
reap
the
most
solid
advantage
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
doctor
stare
at
this
,
and
Booth
thus
proceed
:
"
since
I
have
be
in
this
wretched
place
I
have
employ
my
time
almost
entirely
in
read
over
a
series
of
sermon
which
be
contain
in
that
book
(
meaning
Dr
Barrow
's
work
,
which
then
lie
on
the
table
before
him
)
in
proof
of
the
christian
religion
;
and
so
good
an
effect
<EOS>
have
they
have
upon
me
,
that
I
shall
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
be
the
well
man
for
them
as
long
as
I
live
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
a
doubt
(
for
I
own
<EOS>
I
have
have
such
)
which
remain
now
unsatisfied
.
<EOS>
if
ever
an
angel
may
be
think
to
guide
the
pen
of
a
writer
,
surely
the
pen
of
that
great
and
good
man
have
such
an
assistant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
doctor
readily
concur
in
the
praise
of
Dr
Barrow
,
and
add
,
"
You
say
you
have
have
your
doubt
,
young
gentleman
;
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
do
not
know
that
 
and
,
pray
,
what
be
your
doubt
?
"
<EOS>
"
whatever
they
be
,
sir
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
they
be
now
satisfied
,
as
I
believe
those
of
every
impartial
and
sensible
reader
will
be
if
he
will
,
with
due
attention
,
read
over
these
excellent
sermon
.
"
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
answer
the
doctor
,
"
though
I
have
converse
,
I
find
,
with
a
false
brother
hitherto
,
I
be
glad
you
be
reconcile
to
truth
at
last
,
and
I
hope
your
future
faith
will
have
some
influence
on
your
future
life
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
tell
you
,
sir
,
"
reply
Booth
,
"
that
will
always
be
the
case
where
faith
be
sincere
,
as
I
assure
you
mine
be
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
never
be
a
rash
disbeliever
;
my
chief
doubt
be
found
on
this
 
that
,
as
man
appear
to
me
to
act
entirely
from
their
passion
,
their
action
could
have
neither
merit
nor
demerit
.
"
<EOS>
"
a
very
worthy
conclusion
truly
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
doctor
;
"
but
if
man
act
,
as
I
believe
they
do
,
from
their
passion
,
it
would
be
fair
to
conclude
that
religion
to
be
true
which
apply
immediately
to
the
strong
of
these
passion
,
hope
and
fear
;
chuse
rather
to
rely
on
its
reward
and
punishment
than
on
that
native
beauty
of
virtue
which
some
of
the
antient
philosopher
think
proper
to
recommend
to
their
disciple
.
<EOS>
but
we
will
defer
this
discourse
till
another
opportunity
;
at
present
,
as
the
devil
hath
think
proper
to
set
you
free
,
I
will
try
if
I
can
prevail
on
the
bailiff
to
do
the
same
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
really
not
so
much
money
in
town
as
Booth
's
debt
amount
to
,
and
therefore
,
though
he
would
otherwise
very
willingly
have
pay
it
,
he
be
force
to
give
bail
to
the
action
.
<EOS>
for
which
purpose
,
as
the
bailiff
be
a
man
of
great
form
,
he
be
oblige
to
get
another
person
to
be
bind
with
him
.
<EOS>
this
person
,
however
,
the
attorney
undertake
to
procure
,
and
immediately
set
out
in
quest
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
during
his
absence
the
bailiff
come
into
the
room
,
and
,
address
himself
to
the
doctor
,
say
,
"
I
think
,
sir
,
your
name
be
Doctor
Harrison
?
<EOS>
"
the
doctor
immediately
acknowledge
his
name
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
bailiff
have
see
it
to
a
bail
-
bond
before
.
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
sir
,
"
say
the
bailiff
,
"
there
be
a
man
above
in
a
die
condition
that
desire
the
favour
of
speak
to
you
;
I
believe
he
want
you
to
pray
by
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bailiff
himself
be
not
more
ready
to
execute
his
office
on
all
occasion
for
his
fee
than
the
doctor
be
to
execute
his
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
without
make
any
further
enquiry
therefore
into
the
condition
of
the
man
,
he
immediately
go
up
-
stair
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
bailiff
return
down
-
stair
,
which
be
immediately
after
he
have
lodge
the
doctor
in
the
room
,
Booth
have
the
curiosity
to
ask
him
who
this
man
be
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
do
not
know
much
of
him
,
"
say
the
bailiff
;
"
I
have
him
once
in
custody
before
now
:
<EOS>
I
remember
it
be
when
your
honour
be
here
last
;
and
now
I
remember
,
too
,
he
say
that
he
know
your
honour
very
well
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
some
opinion
of
him
at
that
time
,
for
he
spend
his
money
very
much
like
a
gentleman
;
but
I
have
discover
since
that
he
be
a
poor
fellow
,
and
worth
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
mere
shy
cock
;
I
have
have
the
stuff
about
me
this
week
,
and
could
never
get
at
him
till
this
morning
;
nay
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
believe
we
should
ever
have
find
out
his
lodging
have
it
not
be
for
the
attorney
that
be
here
just
now
,
who
give
us
information
.
<EOS>
and
so
we
take
him
this
morning
by
a
comical
way
enough
;
for
we
dress
up
one
of
my
man
in
woman
's
cloathe
,
who
tell
the
people
of
the
house
that
he
be
his
sister
,
<EOS>
just
come
to
town
 
for
we
be
tell
by
the
attorney
that
he
have
such
a
sister
,
upon
which
he
be
let
up
-
stair
 
and
so
keep
the
door
ajar
till
I
and
another
rush
in
.
<EOS>
let
me
tell
you
,
captain
,
there
be
as
good
stratagem
make
use
of
in
our
business
as
any
in
the
army
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
pray
,
sir
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
do
not
you
tell
me
this
morning
that
the
poor
fellow
be
desperately
wound
;
nay
,
I
think
you
tell
the
doctor
that
he
be
a
die
man
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
have
like
to
have
forget
that
,
"
cry
the
bailiff
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
would
serve
the
gentleman
but
that
he
must
make
resistance
,
and
he
give
my
man
a
blow
with
a
stick
;
but
I
soon
quiet
him
by
give
him
a
wipe
or
two
with
a
hanger
.
<EOS>
not
that
,
I
believe
,
I
have
do
his
business
neither
;
but
the
fellow
be
faint
-
hearted
,
and
the
surgeon
,
I
fancy
,
frighten
him
more
than
he
need
.
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
let
the
bad
come
to
the
bad
,
the
law
be
all
on
my
side
,
and
it
be
only
se
fendendo
.
<EOS>
the
attorney
that
be
here
just
now
tell
me
so
,
and
bid
me
fear
nothing
;
for
that
he
would
stand
my
friend
,
and
undertake
the
cause
;
and
he
be
a
devilish
good
one
at
a
defence
at
the
Old
Bailey
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
him
bring
off
several
that
everybody
think
would
have
be
hang
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
suppose
you
should
be
acquit
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
would
not
the
blood
of
this
poor
wretch
lie
a
little
heavy
at
your
heart
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
it
,
captain
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
bailiff
.
<EOS>
"
be
not
all
do
in
a
lawful
way
?
<EOS>
why
will
people
resist
the
law
when
they
know
the
consequence
?
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
if
a
man
be
to
kill
another
in
an
unlawful
manner
as
it
be
,
and
what
the
law
call
murder
,
that
be
quite
and
clear
another
thing
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
care
to
be
convict
of
murder
any
more
than
another
man
.
<EOS>
why
now
,
captain
,
you
have
be
abroad
in
the
war
they
tell
me
,
and
to
be
sure
must
have
kill
man
in
your
time
.
<EOS>
pray
,
be
you
ever
afraid
afterwards
of
see
their
ghost
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
different
affair
,
"
cry
Booth
;
"
but
I
would
not
kill
a
man
in
cold
blood
for
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
difference
at
all
,
as
I
can
see
,
"
cry
the
bailiff
.
<EOS>
"
one
be
as
much
in
the
way
of
business
as
the
other
.
<EOS>
when
gentleman
behave
themselves
like
unto
gentleman
I
know
how
to
treat
them
as
such
as
well
as
any
officer
the
king
hath
;
and
when
they
do
not
,
why
they
must
take
what
follow
,
and
the
law
doth
not
call
it
murder

"
  
<EOS>
Booth
very
plainly
see
that
the
bailiff
have
square
his
conscience
exactly
accord
to
law
,
and
that
he
could
not
easily
subvert
his
way
of
thinking
.

He
therefore
give
up
the
cause
,
and
desire
the
bailiff
to
expedite
the
bond
,
which
he
promise
to
do
;
say
,
he
hope
he
have
use
him
with
proper
civility
this
time
,
if
he
have
not
the
last
,
and
that
he
should
be
remember
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
we
close
this
chapter
we
shall
endeavour
to
satisfy
an
enquiry
,
which
may
arise
in
our
most
favourite
reader
(
for
so
<EOS>
be
the
most
curious
)
,
<EOS>
how
it
come
to
pass
that
such
a
person
as
be
Doctor
Harrison
should
employ
such
a
fellow
as
this
Murphy
?
  
<EOS>
the
case
then
be
thus
:
this
Murphy
have
be
clerk
to
an
attorney
in
the
very
same
town
in
which
the
doctor
live
,
and
,
when
he
be
out
of
his
time
,
have
set
up
with
a
character
fair
enough
,
and
have
marry
a
maid
-
servant
of
Mrs.
Harris
,
by
which
mean
he
have
all
the
business
to
which
that
lady
and
her
friend
,
in
which
number
be
the
doctor
,
could
recommend
him
.
  
<EOS>
Murphy
go
on
with
his
business
,
and
thrive
very
well
,
till
he
happen
to
make
an
unfortunate
slip
,
in
which
he
be
detect
by
a
brother
of
the
same
calling
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
we
call
this
by
the
gentle
name
of
a
slip
,
in
respect
to
its
being
so
extremely
common
,
it
be
a
matter
in
which
the
law
,
if
it
have
ever
come
to
its
ear
,
would
have
pass
a
very
severe
censure
,
be
,
indeed
,
no
less
than
perjury
and
subornation
of
perjury
.
  
<EOS>
this
brother
attorney
,
be
a
very
good
-
natured
man
,
and
unwilling
to
bespatter
his
own
profession
,
and
consider
,
perhaps
,
that
the
consequence
do
in
no
wise
affect
the
public
,
who
have
no
manner
of
interest
in
the
alternative
whether
a.
,
in
whom
the
right
be
,
or
B.
,
to
whom
Mr.
Murphy
,
by
the
mean
aforesaid
,
have
transfer
it
,
succeed
in
an
action
;
we
mention
this
particular
,
because
,
as
this
brother
attorney
be
a
very
violent
party
man
,
and
a
profess
stickler
for
the
public
,
to
suffer
any
injury
to
have
be
do
to
that
,
would
have
be
highly
inconsistent
with
his
principle
.
  
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
therefore
,
come
to
Mr.
Murphy
,
and
,
after
shew
him
that
he
have
it
in
his
power
to
convict
him
of
the
aforesaid
crime
,
very
generously
tell
him
that
he
have
not
the
least
delight
in
bring
any
man
to
destruction
,
nor
the
least
animosity
against
him
.
<EOS>
all
that
he
insist
upon
be
,
that
he
would
not
live
in
the
same
town
or
county
with
one
who
have
be
guilty
of
such
an
action
.
<EOS>
He
then
tell
Mr.
Murphy
that
he
would
keep
the
secret
on
two
condition
;
the
one
be
,
that
he
immediately
quit
that
country
;
the
other
be
,
that
he
should
convince
him
he
deserve
this
kindness
by
his
gratitude
,
and
that
Murphy
should
transfer
to
the
other
all
the
business
which
he
then
have
in
those
part
,
and
to
which
he
could
possibly
recommend
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
observation
of
a
very
wise
man
,
that
it
be
a
very
common
exercise
of
wisdom
in
this
world
,
of
two
evil
to
chuse
the
least
.
<EOS>
the
reader
,
therefore
,
can
not
doubt
but
that
Mr.
Murphy
comply
with
the
alternative
propose
by
his
kind
brother
,
and
accept
the
term
on
which
secrecy
be
to
be
obtain
.
  
<EOS>
this
happen
while
the
doctor
be
abroad
,
and
with
all
this
,
except
the
departure
of
Murphy
,
not
only
the
doctor
,
but
the
whole
town
(
save
his
aforesaid
brother
alone
)
,
be
to
this
day
unacquainted
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
at
his
return
,
hear
that
Mr.
Murphy
be
go
,
apply
to
the
other
attorney
in
his
affair
,
who
still
employ
this
Murphy
as
his
agent
in
town
,
partly
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
out
of
good
will
to
him
,
and
partly
from
the
recommendation
of
Miss
Harris
;
for
,
as
he
have
marry
a
servant
of
the
family
,
and
a
particular
favourite
of
her
,
there
can
be
no
wonder
that
she
,
who
be
entirely
ignorant
of
the
affair
above
relate
,
as
well
as
of
his
conduct
in
town
,
should
continue
her
favour
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
will
appear
,
therefore
,
I
apprehend
,
no
longer
strange
that
the
doctor
,
who
have
see
this
man
but
three
time
since
his
removal
to
town
,
and
then
converse
with
him
only
on
business
,
should
remain
as
ignorant
of
his
life
and
character
,
as
a
man
generally
be
of
the
character
of
the
hackney
-
coachman
who
drive
him
.
<EOS>
nor
doth
it
reflect
more
on
the
honour
or
understanding
of
the
doctor
,
under
these
circumstance
,
to
employ
Murphy
,
than
it
would
if
he
have
be
drive
about
the
town
by
a
thief
or
a
murderer
.
    
<EOS>
what
pass
between
the
doctor
and
the
sick
man
.
 
<EOS>
We
leave
the
doctor
in
the
last
chapter
with
the
wounded
man
,
to
whom
the
doctor
,
in
a
very
gentle
voice
,
speak
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
,
friend
,
to
see
you
in
this
situation
,
and
be
very
ready
to
give
you
any
comfort
or
assistance
within
my
power
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
kindly
,
doctor
,
"
say
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
I
should
not
have
presume
to
have
send
to
you
<EOS>
have
I
not
know
your
character
;
for
,
though
I
believe
I
be
not
at
all
know
to
you
,
I
have
live
many
year
in
that
town
where
you
yourself
have
a
house
;
my
name
be
Robinson
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
write
for
the
attorney
in
those
part
,
and
I
have
be
employ
on
your
business
in
my
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
recollect
you
nor
your
name
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
but
consider
,
friend
,
your
moment
be
precious
,
and
<EOS>
your
business
,
as
I
be
inform
,
be
to
offer
up
your
prayer
to
that
great
being
before
whom
you
be
shortly
to
appear
.
<EOS>
but
first
let
me
exhort
you
earnestly
to
a
most
serious
repentance
of
all
your
sin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
o
doctor
!
"
say
the
man
;
"
pray
;
what
be
your
opinion
of
a
death
-
bed
repentance
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
repentance
be
sincere
,
"
cry
the
doctor
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
,
through
the
mercy
and
merit
of
our
most
powerful
and
benign
Intercessor
,
it
will
never
come
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
do
not
you
think
,
sir
,
"
cry
the
man
,
"
that
,
in
order
to
obtain
forgiveness
of
any
great
sin
we
have
commit
,
by
an
injury
do
to
our
neighbour
,
it
be
necessary
,
as
far
as
in
us
lie
,
to
make
all
the
amend
we
can
to
the
party
injure
,
and
to
undo
,
if
possible
,
the
injury
we
have
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
most
undoubtedly
,
"
cry
the
doctor
;
"
our
pretence
to
repentance
would
otherwise
be
gross
hypocrisy
,
and
an
impudent
attempt
to
deceive
and
impose
upon
our
Creator
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
"
cry
the
penitent
;
"
and
I
think
further
,
that
this
be
throw
in
my
way
,
and
hint
to
me
by
that
great
being
;
for
an
accident
happen
to
me
yesterday
,
by
which
,
as
thing
have
fall
out
since
,
I
think
I
plainly
discern
the
hand
of
Providence
.
<EOS>
I
go
yesterday
,
<EOS>
sir
,
you
must
know
,
to
a
pawnbroker
's
,
to
pawn
the
last
moveable
,
which
,
except
the
poor
cloathe
you
see
on
my
back
,
I
be
worth
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
there
a
young
lady
come
in
to
pawn
her
picture
.
<EOS>
She
have
disguise
herself
so
much
,
and
pull
her
hood
so
over
her
face
,
that
I
do
not
know
her
while
she
stay
,
which
be
scarce
three
minute
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
be
go
the
pawnbroker
,
take
the
picture
in
his
hand
,
cry
out
,
upon
my
word
,
this
be
the
handsome
face
I
ever
see
in
my
life
!
<EOS>
I
desire
him
to
let
me
look
on
the
picture
,
which
he
readily
do
 
and
I
no
sooner
cast
my
eye
upon
it
,
than
the
strong
resemblance
strike
me
,
and
I
know
it
to
be
Mrs.
Booth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Booth
!
<EOS>
what
Mrs.
Booth
?
"
cry
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Booth

the

impetuosity

<EOS>
"
have
patience

"
say
the
man
,
"
and
you
shall
hear
all
.
<EOS>
I
express
some
surprize
to
the
pawnbroker
,
and
ask
the
lady
's
name
.
<EOS>
He
answer
,
that
he
know
not
her
name
;
but
that
she
be
some
undone
wretch
,
who
have
the
day

<EOS>
My

a
dram
which
the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

accessary

<EOS>
how
accessary

say
the
doctor

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
pray
tell

for
I
be
impatient
to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
all
as
fast

<EOS>
"
You

good
doctor

that
Mrs.
Harris

our
town

while

be
in
this
violent
agitation
the
surgeon
make
his
appearance

stand
still
in
a
meditate
posture

examine
his

I
do
not

what
you
call
immediate

He
may
live
several
day
 
<EOS>
nay

he
may
recover

It
be
impossible

any
certain
opinion

<EOS>
He
then
launch
forth
into
a
set
of
term
which
the
doctor
,
with
all
his
scholarship

could
not
understand

<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
many
of
them
be
not
to
be
find
in
any
dictionary
or
lexicon
.
  
<EOS>
one
discovery
,
however
,
the
doctor
make
,
and
that
be
,
that
the
surgeon
be
a
very
ignorant
,
conceited
fellow
,
and
know
nothing
of
his
profession
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
,
therefore
,
to
get
well
advice
for
the
sick

but
this
he
postpone
at
present
,
and
,
apply
himself
to
the
surgeon
,
say
,
"
He
should
be
very
much
oblige
to
him
if
he
know
where
to
find
such
a
counsellor
,
and
would
fetch
him
thither
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
ask
such
a
favour
of
you
,
sir
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
if
it
be
not
on
business
of
the
last
importance
,
or
if
I
could
find
any
other
messenger
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fetch
,
sir
!
"
say
the
surgeon
very
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
take
me
for
a
footman
or
a
porter
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
who
you
be
;
but
I
believe
you
be
full
as
proper
to
go
on
such
an
errand
as
I
be
.
"
<EOS>
(
for
as
the
doctor
,
who
be
just
come
off
his
journey
,
be
very
roughly
dress
,
the
surgeon
hold
him
in
no
great
respect
.
)
<EOS>
the
surgeon
then
call
aloud
from
the
top
of
the
stair
,
"
let
my
coachman
draw
up
,
"
and
strut
off
without
any
ceremony
,
tell
his
patient
he
would
call
again
the
next
day

<EOS>
at
this
very
instant
arrive
Murphy
with
the
other

cry
the
bailiff

<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be

this

accompany
with

Murphy
,
who
know
well

the
bailiff
;

,
though

say
he
to
Harrison
,
<EOS>
"
you
do
not

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
bailiff

"
cry
one
of
the
mob
:
<EOS>
"
one
lawyer
will
always
stand
by
another

but
I
think
the

be
a
very
good
man

act
become
a

to
stand
by
the
poor

"
  
<EOS>
at
which
word
the
mob
all
give
a
great
shout
,
and
several
cry
out
,
"
bring
him
along
,
away
with
him
to
the
justice
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
now
a
constable
appear
,
and
with
an
authoritative
voice
declare
what
he
be
,
produce
his
staff
,
and
demand
the
peace
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
then
deliver
his
prisoner
over
to
the
officer
,
and
charge
him
with
felony
;
the
constable
receive
him
,
the
attorney
submit
,
the
bailiff
be
hush
,
and
the
wave
of
the
mob
immediately
subside
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
now
balance
with
himself
how
he
should
proceed
:
at
last
he
determine
to
leave
Booth
a
little
longer
in
captivity
,
and
not
to
quit
sight
of
Murphy
before
he
have
lodge
him
safe
with
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
They
then
all
move
forwards
to
the
justice
;
the
constable
and
his
prisoner
march
first
,
the
doctor
and
the
bailiff
follow
next
,
and
about
five
thousand
mob
(
for
no
less
number
be
assemble
in
a
very
few
minute
)
follow
in
the
procession
.
  
<EOS>
They
find
the
magistrate
just
sit
down
to
his
dinner
;
however
,
when
he
be
acquaint
with
the
doctor
's
profession
,
he
immediately
admit
him
,
and
hear
his
business
;
which
he
no
sooner
perfectly
understand
,
with
all
its
circumstance
,
than
he
resolve
,
though
it
be
then
very
late
,
and
he
have
be
fatigue
all
the
morning
with
public
business
,
to
postpone
all
refreshment
till
he
have
discharge
his
duty
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
adjourn
the
prisoner
and
his
cause
to
the
bailiff
's
house
,
whither
he
himself
,
with
the
doctor
,
immediately
repair
,
and
whither
the
attorney
be
follow
by
a
much
large
number
of
attendant
than
he
have
be
honour
with
before
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
history
draw
towards
a
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
exceed
the
astonishment
of
Booth
at
the
behaviour
of
the
doctor
at
the
time
when
he
sally
forth
in
pursuit
of
the
attorney
;
for
which
it
be
so
impossible
for
him
to
account
in
any
manner
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
He
remain
a
long
time
in
the
utmost
torture
of
mind
,
till
at
last
the
bailif
's
wife
come
to
him
,
and
ask
him
if
the
doctor
be
not
a
madman
?
<EOS>
and
,
in
truth
,
he
could
hardly
defend
him
from
that
imputation
.
  
<EOS>
while
he
be
in
this
perplexity
the
maid
of
the
house
bring
him
a
message
from
Robinson
,
desire
the
favour
of
see
him
above
-
stair
.
<EOS>
with
this
he
immediately
comply
.
  
<EOS>
when
these
two
be
alone
together
,
and
the
key
turn
on
them
(
for
the
bailiff
's
wife
<EOS>
be
a
most
careful
person
,
and
never
omit
that
ceremony
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
,
have
always
at
her
tongue
's
end
that
excellent
proverb
of
"
safe
bind
,
safe
find
"
)
,
Robinson
,
look
stedfastly
upon
Booth
,
say
,
"
I
believe
,
sir
,
you
scarce
remember
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
answer
that
he
think
he
have
see
his
face
somewhere
before
,
but
could
not
then
recollect
when
or
where
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
man
,
"
it
be
a
place
which
no
man
can
remember
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
but
do
you
not
remember
,
a
few
week
ago
,
that
you
have
the
misfortune
to
be
in
a
certain
prison
in
this
town
,
where
you
lose
a
trifling
sum
at
card
to
a
fellow
-
prisoner
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
hint
sufficiently
awaken
Booth
's
memory
,
and
he
now
recollect
the
feature
of
his
old
friend
Robinson
.
<EOS>
He
answer
him
a
little
surlily
,
"
I
know
you
now
very
well
,
but
I
do
not
imagine
you
would
ever
have
remind
me
of
that
transaction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
alas
,
sir
!
"
answer
Robinson
,
"
whatever
happen
then
be
very
trifling
compare
to
the
injury
I
have
do
you
;
but
if
my
life
be
spare
long
enough
I
will
now
undo
it
all
:
<EOS>
and
,
as
I
have
be
one
of
your
bad
enemy
,
I
will
now
be
one
of
your
good
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
just
enter
upon
his
story
when
a
noise
be
hear
below
which
may
be
almost
compare
to
what
have
be
hear
in
Holland
when
the
dyke
have
give
way
,
and
the
ocean
in
an
inundation
break
in
upon
the
land
.
<EOS>
It
seem
,
indeed
,
as
if
the
whole
world
be
burst
into
the
house
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
a
man
of
great
firmness
of
mind
,
and
he
have
need
of
it
all
at
this
instant
.
<EOS>
as
for
poor
Robinson
,
the
usual
concomitant
of
guilt
attend
him
,
and
he
begin
to
tremble
in
a
violent
manner
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
person
who
ascend
the
stair
be
the
doctor
,
who
no
sooner
see
Booth
than
he
run
to
him
and
embrace
him
,
cry
,
"
<EOS>
My
child
,
I
wish
you
joy
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Your
suffering
be
all
at
an
end
,
and
Providence
hath
do
you
the
justice
at
last
which
it
will
,
one
day
or
other
,
render
to
all
man
.
<EOS>
You
will
hear
all
presently
;
but
I
can
now
only
tell
you
that
your
sister
be
discover
and
the
estate
be
your
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
Booth
be
in
such
confusion
that
he
scarce
make
any
answer
,
and
now
appear
the
justice
and
his
clerk
,
and
immediately
afterwards
the
constable
with
his
prisoner
,
the
bailiff
,
and
as
many
more
as
could
possibly
crowd
up
-
stair
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
now
address
himself
to
the
sick
man
,
and
desire
him
to
repeat
the
same
information
before
the
justice
which
he
have
make
already
;
to
which
Robinson
readily
consent
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
clerk
be
take
down
the
information
,
the
attorney
express
a
very
impatient
desire
to
send
instantly
for
his
clerk
,
and
express
so
much
uneasiness
at
the
confusion
in
which
he
have
leave
his
paper
at
home
,
that
a
thought
suggest
itself
to
the
doctor
that
,
if
his
house
be
search
,
some
light
and
evidence
relate
to
this
affair
would
certainly
be
find
;
he
therefore
desire
the
justice
to
grant
a
search
-
warrant
immediately
to
search
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
justice
answer
that
he
have
no
such
power
;
that
,
if
there
be
any
suspicion
of
steal
good
,
he
could
grant
a
warrant
to
search
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
,
sir
!
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
can
you
grant
a
warrant
to
search
a
man
's
house
for
a
silver
tea
-
spoon
,
and
not
in
a
case
like
this
,
where
a
man
be
rob
of
his
whole
estate
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
hold
,
sir
,
"
say
the
sick
man
;
"
I
believe
I
can
answer
that
point
;
for
I
can
swear
he
hath
several
title
-
deed
of
the
estate
now
in
his
possession
,
which
I
be
sure
be
steal
from
the
right
owner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
justice
still
hesitate
.
<EOS>
He
say
title
-
deed
savour
of
the
Realty
,
and
it
be
not
felony
to
steal
them
.
<EOS>
if
,
indeed
,
they
be
take
away
in
a
box
,
then
it
would
be
felony
to
steal
the
box
.
  
<EOS>
"
Savour
of
the
Realty
!
<EOS>
Savour
of
the
f
 
talty
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
such
incomprehensible
nonsense
.
<EOS>
this
be
impudent
,
as
well
as
childish
trifling
with
the
life
and
property
of
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
say
Robinson
,
"
I
now
be
sure
I
can
do
his
business
<EOS>
;
for
I
know
he
hath
a
silver
cup
in
his
possession
which
be
the
property
of
this
gentleman
(
mean
Booth
)
,
<EOS>
and
how
he
get
it
<EOS>
but
by
stealth
let
him
account
if
he
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
will
do
,
"
cry
the
justice
with
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
that
will
do
;
and
if
you
will
charge
him
on
oath
with
that
,
I
will
instantly
grant
my
warrant
to
search
his
house
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
I
will
go
and
see
it
execute
,
"
cry
the
doctor
;
for
it
be
a
maxim
of
his
,
that
no
man
could
descend
below
himself
in
do
any
act
which
may
contribute
to
protect
an
innocent
person
,
or
to
bring
a
rogue
to
the
gallow
.
  
<EOS>
the
oath
be
instantly
take
,
the
warrant
sign
,
and
the
doctor
attend
the
constable
in
the
execution
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
clerk
then
proceed
in
take
the
information
of
Robinson
,
and
have
just
finish
it
,
when
the
doctor
return
with
the
utmost
joy
in
his
countenance

and
declare
that
he
have
sufficient
evidence
of
the
fact
in
his
possession
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
indeed
,
two
or
three
letter
from
Miss
Harris
in
answer
to
the
attorney
's
frequent
demand
of
money
for
secrecy
,
that
fully
explain
the
whole
villany
.
  
<EOS>
the
justice
now
ask
the
prisoner
what
he
have
to
say
for
himself
,
or
whether
he
choose
to
say
anything
in
his
own
defence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
the
attorney
,
with
great
confidence
,
"
I
be
not
to
defend
myself
here
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
of
no
service
to
me
;
for
I
know
you
neither
can
nor
will
discharge
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
extremely
innocent
of
all
this
matter
,
as
I
doubt
not
but
to
make
appear
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
court
of
justice
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
legal
previous
ceremony
be
then
go
through
of
bind
over
the
prosecutor
,
&
c.
,
and
then
the
attorney
be
commit
to
Newgate
,
whither
he
be
escort
amidst
the
acclamation
of
the
populace
.
  
<EOS>
when
Murphy
be
depart
,
and
a
little
calm
restore
in
the
house
,
the
justice
make
his
compliment
of
congratulation
to
Booth
,
<EOS>
who
,
as
well
as
he
could
in
his
present
tumult
of
joy
,
return
his
thank
to
both
the
magistrate
and
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
all
prepare
to
depart
,
when
Mr.
Bondum
stept
up
to
Booth
,
and
say
,
"
hold
,
sir
,
you
have
forget
one
thing
 
you
have
not
give
bail
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
occasion
some
distress
at
this
time
,
for
the
attorney
's
friend
be
depart
;
but
when
the
justice
hear
this
,
he
immediately
offer
himself
as
the
other
bondsman
,
and
thus
end
the
affair
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
past
six
o'clock
,
and
none
of
the
gentleman
have
yet
dine
.
<EOS>
They
very
readily
,
therefore
,
accept
the
magistrate
's
invitation
,
and
go
all
together
to
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
very
first
thing
that
be
do
,
even
before
they
sit
down
to
dinner
,
be
to
dispatch
a
messenger
to
one
of
the
good
surgeon
in
town
to
take
care
of
Robinson
,
and
another
messenger
to
Booth
's
lodging
to
prevent
Amelia
's
concern
at
their
staying
so
long
.
  
<EOS>
the
latter
,
however
,
be
to
little
purpose
;
for
Amelia
's
patience
have
be
wear
out
before
,
and
she
have
take
a
hackney
-
coach
and
drive
to
the
bailiff
's
,
where
she
arrive
a
little
after
the
departure
of
her
husband
,
and
be
thence
direct
to
the
justice
's
.
  
<EOS>
though
there
be
no
kind
of
reason
for
Amelia
's
fright
at
hear
that
her
husband
and
Doctor
Harrison
be
go
before
the
justice
,
and
though
she
indeed
imagine
that
they
be
there
in
the
light
of
complainant
,
not
of
offender
,
yet
so
tender
be
her
fear
for
her
husband
,
and
so
much
have
her
gentle
spirit
be
lately
agitate
,
that
she
have
a
thousand
apprehension
of
she
<EOS>
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
when
she
arrive
,
therefore
,
at
the
house
,
she
run
directly
into
the
room
where
all
the
company
be
at
dinner
,
scarce
know
what
she
do
or
whither
she
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
She
find
her
husband
in
such
a
situation
,
and
discover
such
chearfulness
in
his
countenance
,
that
so
violent
a
turn
be
give
to
her
spirit
that
she
be
just
able
,
with
the
assistance
of
a
glass
of
water
,
to
support
herself
.
<EOS>
She
soon
,
however
,
recover
her
calmness
,
and
in
a
little
time
begin
to
eat
what
may
indeed
be
almost
call
her
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
the
justice
now
wish
her
joy
of
what
have
happen
that
day
,
for
which
she
kindly
thank
him
,
apprehend
<EOS>
he
mean
the
liberty
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
His
worship
may
perhaps
have
explain
himself
more
largely
have
not
the
doctor
give
him
a
timely
wink
;
for
this
wise
and
good
man
be
fearful
of
make
such
a
discovery
all
at
once
to
Amelia
,
lest
it
should
overpower
her
,
and
luckily
the
justice
's
wife
be
not
well
enough
acquaint
with
the
matter
to
say
anything
more
on
it
than
barely
to
assure
the
lady
that
she
join
in
her
husband
's
congratulation
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
be
then
in
a
clean
white
gown
,
which
she
have
that
day
redeem
,
and
be
,
indeed
,
dress
all
over
with
great
neatness
and
exactness
;
with
the
glow
therefore
which
arise
in
her
feature
from
find
her
husband
release
from
his
captivity
,
she
make
so
charming
a
figure
,
that
she
attract
the
eye
of
the
magistrate
and
of
his
wife
,
and
they
both
agree
when
they
be
alone
that
they
have
never
see
so
charm
a
creature
;
<EOS>
nay
,
Booth
himself
afterwards
tell
her
that
he
scarce
ever
remember
her
to
look
so
extremely
beautiful
as
she
do
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
whether
Amelia
's
beauty
,
or
the
reflexion
on
the
remarkable
act
of
justice
he
have
perform
,
or
whatever
motive
fill
the
magistrate
with
extraordinary
good
humour
,
and
open
his
heart
and
cellar
,
I
will
not
determine
;
but
he
give
them
so
hearty
a
welcome
,
and
they
be
all
so
pleased
with
each
other
,
that
Amelia
,
for
that
one
night
,
trust
the
care
of
her
child
to
the
woman
where
they
lodge
,
nor
do
the
company
rise
from
table
till
the
clock
strike
eleven
.
  
<EOS>
They
then
separate
.
<EOS>
Amelia
and
Booth
,
have
be
set
down
at
their
lodging
,
retire
into
each
other
's
arm
;
nor
do
Booth
<EOS>
that
evening
,
by
the
doctor
's
advice
,
mention
one
word
of
the
grand
affair
to
his
wife
.
    
<EOS>
thus
this
history
draw
nearer
to
a
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
early
Amelia
receive
the
following
letter
from
Mrs.
Atkinson
:
  
<EOS>
"
the
surgeon
of
the
regiment

prison
by
a
justice
of
peace
for
forgery

<EOS>
for
Heaven
's
sake
send
me
the
truth
.
<EOS>
if
my
husband
can
be
of
any
service
,
weak
as
he

he
will
be
carry
in
a
chair
to
serve
a
brother
officer
for
whom
he
hath
a
regard
,
which
I
need
not
mention
.
<EOS>
or
if
the
sum
of
twenty
pound
will
be
of
any
service
to
you
,
I
will
wait
upon
you
with
it
the
moment
I
can
get
my
cloath
on
,
the
morning
you

for
it

too
late
to

night

<EOS>
the
captain
beg
his
hearty
service

respect

"
  
<EOS>
when
Amelia
read
this
letter
to
Booth
they
be
both
equally
surprize
,
<EOS>
she
at
the
commitment
for
forgery
,
and
he
at
see
such
a
letter
from
Mrs.
Atkinson
;
for
he
be
a
stranger
yet
to
the
reconciliation
that
have
happen
.
  
<EOS>
Booth
's
doubt
be
first
satisfied
by
Amelia
,
from
which
he
receive
great
pleasure
;
for
he
really
have
a
very
great
affection
and
fondness
for
Mr.

who
,
indeed
,
so
well
deserve
it

"

<EOS>
"
why

"
cry
Booth

"
it
be

a
trifle

and
yet
it
will
be
of
great
service
to

<EOS>

say
she
,
"
how
ill

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
can
spare

say
Booth

we
shall
soon

again

when

I

<EOS>
"
I
be

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
however
,
give
me
leave
to
send
an

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>

I
assure
you
it

contrary

my

take
this
money

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

cry
he
,
"
to
act
this
once
contrary

"
<EOS>
He
then
writ
a
short
note
to
Mrs.
Atkinson
,
and
dispatch
it
away
immediately
;
which
when
he
have
do
,
Amelia
say
,
"
I
shall
be
glad

yet
I
wish
you
would
oblige
me
in
refuse
this
money

<EOS>
take
five
guinea
only

<EOS>
that
be
indeed
such
a
sum

,
if

would
sit
light

<EOS>
the
last
person

I

receive
favour

the
poor

generous

<EOS>
"
You
can
receive
favour
only
from
the
generous

"
cry
Booth
;
"
and
,
to
be
plain
with
you
,
there
be
very
few
who
be
generous
that
be
not
poor

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
think
you
,

say
she
,
"
of
Dr
Harrison
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
assure
you
,
"
say
Booth
,
"
he
be
far
from
be
rich

<EOS>
the
doctor
hath
an
income
of
little
more
than
six
hundred
pound
a
-
year
,
and
I
be
convince
he
give
away
four
of
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
be
one
of
the
good
economist
in

yet
I
be
positive
he
never
be
at
any

possess
of
five
hundred

<EOS>
consider
,
dear
Emily

the
late
obligation
we
have
to
this
gentleman
;
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
more
,
at

at
present
;
my
half

pay

mortgage

how

I

why

I
as
well
as
a
thousand
other

who
have
not
the
happiness
of
such
a

to
make
life
delicious

<EOS>
why
should
I
complain
of
my
hard
fate
while
so
many
who
be
much
poor

be
I
of

My
angel

Booth

"
it
delight
me
to
hear
you
talk
thus

reason

I

that
one

can
so
heroically
endure
adversity

bear
prosperity

I

I
dreamt

this
night

that
we
be
in
the
most
miserable
situation
imaginable

indeed
,
in
the
situation
we
be
yesterday
morning
,
or
rather
bad
;
that
I
be
lay
in
a
prison
for
debt
,
and
that
you
want
a
morsel
of
bread
to
feed
the
mouth
of
your
hungry
child

<EOS>
at
length
(
for
nothing
you
know
be
quick
than
the
transition
in
dream

<EOS>
Dr
Harrison
methought
come
to
me
,
with
chearfulness
and
joy
in
his
countenance

<EOS>
the
prison
-
door
immediately
fly
open
,
and
Dr
Harrison
introduce
you
,
gayly
though
not
richly
dress
.
<EOS>
that
you
gently
chid
me
for
stay
so
long
.
<EOS>
all
on
a
sudden
appear
a
coach
with
four
horse
to
it
,
in
which
be
a
maid
-
servant
with
our
two
child
.
<EOS>
We
both
immediately
go
into
the
coach
,
and
,
take
our
leave
of
the
doctor
,
set
out
towards
your
country
-
house
;
for
yours
I
dreamt
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
now
,
if
this
be
real
,
and
the
transition
almost
as
sudden
,
could
you
support
it
?

"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
be
go
to
answer
,
when
Mrs.
Atkinson
come
into
the
room
,
and
after
very
little
previous
ceremony
,
present
Booth
with
a
bank

note

which
he
receive
of
her

say
he
would
very
soon
repay
it

a
promise

a
little

Amelia

no
chance

keep
it

Old

I
have
often
have
it

some

I

<EOS>
there
be
a
circumstance

this

if

He
add
besides
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
skreen
her
and
carry
on
the
prosecution
,
or
,
indeed
,

<EOS>
Amelia
at

beg
