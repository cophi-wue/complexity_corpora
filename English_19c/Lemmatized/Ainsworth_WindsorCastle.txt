from

Richard

Second

there
be
among

young
man
name
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
expertbeyond
his
fellow
in
all
matter
of
woodcraft
,
and
consequently
ingreat
favour
with
the
king
,
who
be
himself
devoted
to
the
chase
.
<EOS>
whenever
he
stay
at
the
castle
,
King
Richard
,
like
our
own
royalharry
,
would
pass
his
time
in
hunting
,
hawking
,
or
shoot
with
thelong
-
bow
;
and
on
all
these
occasion
the
young
keeper
be
hisconstant
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
hart
be
to
be
chase
,
Herne
and
his
twoblack
hound
of
Saint
Hubert
's
breed
would
hunt
him
down
withmarvellous
speed
;

a
wild
boar
be

rear

a
badger

out
,
a
fox

,
a
marten

or
an
otter

Herne
waschosen
for
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
could
fly
a
falcon
so
well
as
Herne
--
no
onecould
break
up
a
deer
so
quickly
or
so
skilfully
as
him
.
<EOS>
but
in
proportionas
he
grow
in
favour
with
the
king
,
the
young
keeper
be
hate
by
hiscomrade
,
and
they
concert
together
how
to
ruin
him
.
 
<EOS>
all
theireffort
,
however
,
be
ineffectual
,
and
rather
tend
to
his
advantagethan
injury
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
day
it
chance
that
the

hunt
in

at

he
pausedbetween

discern
the

of

it

somewhat
more

<EOS>
familiar
with

with
the
poetic
strain
to

his

from

to
the
conclusion
that

neither

in

the

inform
him
he
may
takeexercise

if
he
be
so
inclined

and
he
gladly

of
the
permission

<EOS>
after

to

along
the
walk
for
a
short
time

he
enter
thearbour

upon

He
take

They

"This

a
little
reflection
damp
his

him

there

<EOS>
the
impossibility
of

sit
down
uponthe

the
conviction

out
of

andhe
therefore
endeavour
to
prepare
himself
for
the
bad
,
for
it
<EOS>
wasmore
than
probable
<EOS>
he
would
be
allow
to
perish
of
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
to
afiery
nature
like
his
,
the
dreadful
uncertainty
in
which
he
be
placedwas
more
difficult
of
endurance
than
bodily
torture

he
wasdestine
to
endure
it
long

inspite
of
his

stole
upon
him

filledwith
frightful
vision

how
long

a
manchet
ofbread

part
of
a
cold
neck
of
venison
,
and
a
flask
of
wine
on
the
table

It
be
evident
,
therefore
,
that
his
captor
do
not
mean
to
starve
him
,
and
yield
to
the
prompting
of
appetite

he
attack
the
provision

with
no
bettersuccess

before

he
feel
almost
certain

from
the
position
inwhich
the
bench
be

,
that
the
visitor
have
not
find
entrancethrough
the

<EOS>
after
another
long
and
dreary
interval
,
find
that
sleep
be
stealingupon
him
fast
,
he
place
the
bench
near
the
door

lean
his
backagainst

certain
that
in

His

scarcely
able
to
separate
the

follow
him
,
dash
off
in
thedirection
of
the
sound
.
<EOS>
presently
,
they
perceive
two
figure
beneath
the
tree
,
whom
theyfound
,
on
a
near
approach
,
be
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
with
Mabel
in
astate
of
insensibility
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
dismount
by
the
side
of
his
friend
,
Surrey
hastily
demand
how
hecame
there
,
and
what
have
happened?"It
be
too
long
a
story
to
relate
now
,
"
say
Wyat
;
"
but
the
sum
of
it
be
,
that
I
have
escape
,
by
the
aid
of
this
damsel
,
from
the
clutch
of
thedemon
.
 
<EOS>
Our
escape
be
effect
on
horseback
,
and
we
have
to
plungeinto
the
lake
.
 
<EOS>
the
immersion
deprive
my
fair
preserver
of
sensibility
,
so
that
as
soon
as
I
land
,
and
gain
a
covert
where
I
fancy
myselfsecure
,
I
dismount
,
and
try
to
restore
her
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
thusoccupie
,
the
steed
I
have
bring
with
me
break
his
bridle
,
and
dartedoff
into
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
while
,
Mabel
open
her
eye
,
but
she
wasso
weak
that
she
could
not
move
,
and
I
be
fain
to
make
her
a
couch
inthe
fern
,
in
the
hope
that
she
would
speedily
revive
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
fright
andsuffering
have
be
too
much
for
her
,
and
a
succession
of
fainting
-
fitsfollowed
,
during
which
I
think
she
would
expire
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
letus
prepare
a
litter
for
her
,
and
convey
her
where
proper
assistance
canbe
render
.
<EOS>
"Meanwhile
,
the
other
have
come
up
,
and
Hugh
Dacre

himselffrom
his
horse

Surrey
somewhat
rudely
aside

and
,
take
her
hand

say
,
in
a
voice
of
some
emotion,"Alas

<EOS>
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
to
meet
thee
again
in
this
state

<EOS>
""You

<EOS>
Dacre

an
affirmative

<EOS>
"Who

""I

Dacre
,
in

significanttone

as
he
will
avouch

grand

at

find
that
his

he
bestir

Wyat
and
Surreydashed
after
him
,
and
get
so
near
him
that
they
make
sure
of

<EOS>
but
at
the
very
moment
they
expect
to
reach
him
,
he
turnedhi
horse
's
head
,
and
force
him
to
leap
over
the
blaze
boundary

<EOS>
but
the
demon
hold
on
his
way
,
apparently
unscathed
in
the
midst
ofthe
flame

cast
a
look
of
grim
defiance
at

as

without
bestow
more
than

into
the
upper
part

the
tree

where
he
roaredto
them
most
piteously
for
aid
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
if
they
have
be
dispose
torender
it

it
be
impossible
to

maintain
his
hold

to
which
he
creep

fellinto
the
flame
beneath

<EOS>
attribute
its
outbreak
to
supernatural
agency
,
the
party
gaze
on
inwonder
at
the
fire
,
and
ride
round
it
as
closely
as

though
they
tarry
till

<EOS>
It
serve
to
confirm
the
notion
of
the
supernatural
origin
ofthe
fire

in
that
it
be
confine
within
the
mystic
circle

at

He

the
change

the
notice
of

easily
divine
the

but
all
be
for

<EOS>
for
some
time
previous
to
the
present
era
of
this
chronicle
,
AnneBoleyn
have
observe
a
grow
coolness
towards
her
on
the
part
of

and
latterly
it
have
become
evident
that
his
passion
for
her
wasfast
subsiding
,
if
indeed
it
have
not
altogether
expire
.
<EOS>
though
Anne
have
never
truly
love
her
royal

,
and
though
atthat
very
time
she
be
secretly
encourage
the
regard
of

she
feel
troubled
by
this
change
,
and
watch
all
the

movementswith
jealous
anxiety

It
seem
marvellous
that
