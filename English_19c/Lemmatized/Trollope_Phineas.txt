  
Phineas
Finn
Proposes
to
stand
for
loughshane
 
Dr.
Finn
,
of
Killaloe
,
in
county
Clare
,
be
as
well
know
in
those
part
,
 
<EOS>
the
confine
,
that
is
,
of
the
county
Clare
,
Limerick
,
Tipperary
,
and
Galway
,
 
as
be
the
bishop
himself
who
live
in
the
same
town
,
and
be
as
much
respect
.
<EOS>
many
say
that
the
doctor
be
the
rich
man
of
the
two
,
and
the
practice
of
his
profession
be
extend
over
almost
as
wide
a
district
.
<EOS>
indeed
the
bishop
whom
he
be
privileged
to
attend
,
although
a
Roman
Catholic
,
always
speak
of
their
diocese
be
conterminate
.
<EOS>
It
will
therefore
be
understand
that
Dr.
Finn
,
 
Malachi
Finn
be
his
full
name
,
 
have
obtain
a
wide
reputation
as
a
country
practitioner
in
the
west
of
Ireland
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
a
man
sufficiently
well
to
do
,
though
that
boast
make
by
his
friend
,
that
he
be
as
warm
a
man
as
the
bishop
,
have
but
little
truth
to
support
it
.
<EOS>
bishop
in
Ireland
,
if
they
live
at
home
,
even
in
these
day
,
be
very
warm
man
;
and
Dr.
Finn
have
not
a
penny
in
the
world
for
which
he
have
not
work
hard
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
moreover
,
a
costly
family
,
five
daughter
and
one
son
,
and
,
at
the
time
of
which
we
be
speak
,
no
provision
in
the
way
of
marriage
or
profession
have
be
make
for
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
of
the
one
son
,
Phineas
,
the
hero
of
the
follow
page
,
the
mother
and
five
sister
be
very
proud
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
accustom
to
say
that
his
goose
be
as
good
as
any
other
man
's
goose
,
as
far
as
he
could
see
as
yet
;
but
that
he
should
like
some
very
strong
evidence
before
he
allow
himself
to
express
an
opinion
that
the
young
bird
partook
,
in
any
degree
,
of
the
quality
of
a
swan
.
<EOS>
from
which
it
may
be
gather
that
Dr.
Finn
be
a
man
of
common
-
sense
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
have
come
to
be
a
swan
in
the
estimation
of
his
mother
and
sister
by
reason
of
certain
early
success
at
college
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
whose
religion
be
not
of
that
bitter
kind
in
which
we
in
England
be
apt
to
suppose
that
all
the
Irish
Roman
Catholics
indulge
,
have
send
his
son
to
Trinity
;
and
there
be
some
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Killaloe
,
 
patient
,
probably
,
of
Dr.
Duggin
,
of
Castle
Connell
,
a
learn
physician
who
have
spend
a
fruitless
life
in
endeavour
to
make
head
against
Dr.
Finn
,
 
who
declare
that
old
Finn
would
not
be
sorry
if
his
son
be
to
turn
Protestant
and
go
in
for
a
fellowship
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
be
a
Protestant
,
and
the
five
Miss
Finns
be
Protestants
,
and
the
doctor
himself
be
very
much
give
to
dine
out
among
his
protestant
friend
on
a
Friday
.
<EOS>
Our
Phineas
,
however
,
do
not
turn
Protestant
up
in
Dublin
,
whatever
his
father
's
secret
wish
on
that
subject
may
have
be
.
<EOS>
He
do
join
a
debate
society
,
to
success
in
which
his
religion
be
no
bar
;
and
he
there
achieve
a
sort
of
distinction
which
be
both
easy
and
pleasant
,
and
<EOS>
which
,
make
its
way
down
to
Killaloe
,
assist
in
engender
those
idea
as
to
swanhood
of
which
maternal
and
sisterly
mind
be
so
sweetly
susceptible
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
half
a
dozen
old
windbag
at
the
present
moment
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
who
be
great
fellow
at
debate
club
when
they
be
boy
.
"
<EOS>
"
phineas
be
not
a
boy
any
longer
,
"
say
Mrs.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
windbag
do
not
get
college
scholarship
,
"
say
Matilda
Finn
,
the
second
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
papa
always
snub
Phinny
,
"
say
Barbara
,
the
young
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
snub
you
,
if
you
do
not
take
care
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
take
Barbara
tenderly
by
the
ear
;
 
for
his
young
daughter
be
the
doctor
's
pet
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
certainly
do
not
snub
his
son
,
for
he
allow
him
to
go
over
to
London
when
he
be
twenty
-
two
year
of
age
,
in
order
that
he
may
read
with
an
english
barrister
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
doctor
's
wish
that
his
son
may
be
call
to
the
Irish
Bar
,
and
the
young
man
's
desire
that
he
may
go
to
the
English
Bar
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
so
far
give
way
,
under
the
influence
of
Phineas
himself
,
and
of
all
the
young
woman
of
the
family
,
as
to
pay
the
usual
fee
to
a
very
competent
and
learn
gentleman
in
the
Middle
Temple
,
and
to
allow
his
son
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
per
annum
for
three
year
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Finn
,
however
,
be
still
firm
in
his
intention
that
his
son
should
settle
in
Dublin
,
and
take
the
Munster
Circuit
,
 
believe
that
Phineas
may
come
to
want
home
influence
and
home
connection
,
in
spite
of
the
swanhood
which
be
attribute
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
sit
his
term
for
three
year
,
and
be
duly
call
to
the
Bar
;
but
no
evidence
come
home
as
to
the
acquirement
of
any
considerable
amount
of
law
lore
,
or
even
as
to
much
law
study
,
on
the
part
of
the
young
aspirant
.
<EOS>
the
learned
pundit
at
whose
foot
he
have
be
sit
be
not
especially
loud
in
praise
of
his
pupil
's
industry
,
though
he
do
say
a
pleasant
word
or
two
as
to
his
pupil
's
intelligence
.
<EOS>
Phineas
himself
do
not
boast
much
of
his
own
hard
work
when
at
home
during
the
long
vacation
.
<EOS>
no
rumours
of
expect
success
,
 
of
expect
professional
success
,
 
reach
the
ear
of
any
of
the
Finn
family
at
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
there
come
tiding
which
maintain
those
high
idea
in
the
maternal
bosom
of
which
mention
have
be
make
,
and
which
be
of
sufficient
strength
to
induce
the
doctor
,
in
opposition
to
his
own
judgment
,
to
consent
to
the
continue
residence
of
his
son
in
London
.
<EOS>
Phineas
belong
to
an
excellent
club
,
 
the
Reform
Club
,
 
and
go
into
very
good
society
.
<EOS>
He
be
hand
in
glove
with
the
Hon
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
the
young
son
of
Lord
Claddagh
.
<EOS>
He
be
intimate
with
Barrington
Erle
,
who
have
be
private
secretary
,
 
one
of
the
private
secretary
,
 
to
the
great
Whig
Prime
Minister
who
be
lately
in
but
be
now
out
.
<EOS>
He
have
dine
three
or
four
time
with
that
great
Whig
nobleman
,
the
Earl
of
Brentford
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
be
assure
that
if
he
stick
to
the
English
Bar
he
would
certainly
do
well
.
<EOS>
though
he
may
fail
to
succeed
in
court
or
in
chamber
,
he
would
doubtless
have
give
to
him
some
one
of
those
numerous
appointment
for
which
none
but
clever
young
barrister
be
suppose
to
be
fitting
candidate
.
<EOS>
the
old
doctor
yield
for
another
year
,
although
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
he
be
call
upon
to
pay
a
sum
of
three
hundred
pound
,
which
be
then
due
by
Phineas
to
creditor
in
London
.
<EOS>
when
the
doctor
's
male
friend
in
and
about
Killaloe
hear
that
he
have
do
so
,
they
say
that
he
be
dote
.
<EOS>
not
one
of
the
Miss
Finns
be
as
yet
married
;
and
,
after
all
that
have
be
say
about
the
doctor
's
wealth
,
it
be
suppose
that
there
would
not
be
above
five
hundred
pound
a
year
among
them
all
,
be
he
to
give
up
his
profession
.
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
,
when
he
pay
that
three
hundred
pound
for
his
son
,
buckle
to
his
work
again
,
though
he
have
for
twelve
month
talk
of
give
up
the
midwifery
.
<EOS>
He
buckle
to
again
,
to
the
great
disgust
of
Dr.
Duggin
,
who
at
this
time
say
very
ill
-
natured
thing
about
young
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
three
year
Phineas
be
call
to
the
Bar
,
and
immediately
receive
a
letter
from
his
father
ask
minutely
as
to
his
professional
intention
.
<EOS>
His
father
recommend
him
to
settle
in
Dublin
,
and
promise
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
for
three
more
year
,
on
condition
that
this
advice
be
follow
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
absolutely
say
that
the
allowance
would
be
stop
if
the
advice
be
not
follow
,
but
that
be
plainly
to
be
imply
.
<EOS>
that
letter
come
at
the
moment
of
a
dissolution
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
,
the
conservative
Prime
Minister
,
who
have
now
be
in
office
for
the
almost
unprecedentedly
long
period
of
fifteen
month
,
have
find
that
he
could
not
face
continue
majority
against
him
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
have
dissolve
the
House
.
<EOS>
Rumour
declare
that
he
would
have
much
prefer
to
resign
,
and
betake
himself
once
again
to
the
easy
glory
of
opposition
;
but
his
party
have
naturally
be
obdurate
with
him
,
and
he
have
resolve
to
appeal
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
when
Phineas
receive
his
father
's
letter
,
it
have
just
be
suggest
to
him
at
the
Reform
Club
that
he
should
stand
for
the
irish
borough
of
Loughshane
.
  
<EOS>
this
proposition
have
take
Phineas
Finn
so
much
by
surprise
that
when
first
make
to
him
by
Barrington
Erle
it
take
his
breath
away
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
he
stand
for
Parliament
,
twenty
-
four
year
old
,
with
no
vestige
of
property
belong
to
him
,
without
a
penny
in
his
purse
,
as
completely
dependent
on
his
father
as
he
be
when
he
first
go
to
school
at
eleven
year
of
age
!
<EOS>
and
for
Loughshane
,
a
little
borough
in
the
county
Galway
,
for
which
a
brother
of
that
fine
old
irish
peer
,
the
Earl
of
Tulla
,
have
be
sit
for
the
last
twenty
year
,
 
a
fine
,
high
-
minded
representative
of
the
thorough
-
go
Orange
Protestant
feeling
of
Ireland
!
<EOS>
and
the
Earl
of
Tulla
,
to
whom
almost
all
Loughshane
belong
,
 
or
at
any
rate
the
land
about
Loughshane
,
 
be
one
of
his
father
's
staunch
friend
!
<EOS>
Loughshane
be
in
county
Galway
,
but
the
Earl
of
Tulla
usually
live
at
his
seat
in
county
Clare
,
not
more
than
ten
mile
from
Killaloe
,
and
always
confide
his
gouty
foot
,
and
the
weak
nerve
of
the
old
countess
,
and
the
stomach
of
all
his
domestic
,
to
the
care
of
Dr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
how
be
it
possible
that
Phineas
should
stand
for
Loughshane
?
<EOS>
from
whence
be
the
money
to
come
for
such
a
contest
?
<EOS>
It
be
a
beautiful
dream
,
a
grand
idea
,
lift
Phineas
almost
off
the
earth
by
its
glory
.
<EOS>
when
the
proposition
be
first
make
to
him
in
the
smoking
-
room
at
the
Reform
Club
by
his
friend
Erle
,
he
be
aware
that
he
blush
like
a
girl
,
and
that
he
be
unable
at
the
moment
to
express
himself
plainly
,
 
so
great
<EOS>
be
his
astonishment
and
so
great
his
gratification
.
<EOS>
but
before
ten
minute
have
pass
by
,
while
Barrington
Erle
be
still
sit
over
his
shoulder
on
the
club
sofa
,
and
before
the
blush
have
altogether
vanish
,
he
have
see
the
improbability
of
the
scheme
,
and
have
explain
to
his
friend
that
the
thing
could
not
be
do
.
<EOS>
but
to
his
increase
astonishment
,
his
friend
make
nothing
of
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Loughshane
,
accord
to
Barrington
Erle
,
be
so
small
a
place
,
that
the
expense
would
be
very
little
.
<EOS>
there
be
altogether
no
more
than
307
register
elector
.
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
be
so
far
remove
from
the
world
,
and
be
so
ignorant
of
the
world
's
good
thing
,
that
they
know
nothing
about
bribery
.
<EOS>
the
Hon
.
<EOS>
George
Morris
,
who
have
sit
for
the
last
twenty
year
,
be
very
unpopular
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
near
the
borough
since
the
last
election
,
he
have
hardly
do
more
than
show
himself
in
Parliament
,
and
have
neither
give
a
shilling
in
the
town
nor
get
a
place
under
Government
for
a
single
son
of
Loughshane
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
have
quarrel
with
his
brother
,
"
say
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
the
devil
he
have
!
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
always
swear
by
each
other
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
be
at
each
other
they
swear
now
,
"
say
Barrington
;
<EOS>
"
George
have
ask
the
Earl
for
more
money
,
and
the
Earl
have
cut
up
rusty
.
<EOS>
"
then
the
negotiator
go
on
to
explain
that
the
expense
of
the
election
would
be
defray
out
of
a
certain
fund
collect
for
such
purpose
,
that
Loughshane
have
be
choose
as
a
cheap
place
,
and
that
Phineas
Finn
have
be
choose
as
a
safe
and
promising
young
man
.
<EOS>
as
for
qualification
,
if
any
question
be
raise
,
that
should
be
make
all
right
.
<EOS>
an
irish
candidate
be
want
,
and
a
Roman
Catholic
.
<EOS>
so
much
the
Loughshaners
would
require
on
their
own
account
when
instigate
to
dismiss
from
their
service
that
thorough
-
go
Protestant
,
the
Hon
.
<EOS>
George
Morris
.
<EOS>
then
"
the
party
,
"
 
by
which
Barrington
Erle
probably
mean
the
great
man
in
whose
service
he
himself
have
become
a
politician
,
 
require
that
the
candidate
should
be
a
safe
man
,
one
who
would
support
"
the
party
,
"
 
not
a
cantankerous
,
red
-
hot
semi
-
fenian
,
run
about
to
meeting
at
the
Rotunda
,
and
such
-
like
,
with
view
of
his
own
about
tenant
-
right
and
the
Irish
Church
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
view
of
my
own
,
"
say
Phineas
,
blush
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
you
have
,
my
dear
boy
,
"
say
Barrington
,
clap
him
on
the
back
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
come
to
you
unless
you
have
view
.
<EOS>
but
your
view
and
our
be
the
same
,
and
you
be
just
the
lad
for
Galway
.
<EOS>
You
might
not
have
such
an
opening
again
in
your
life
,
and
of
course
you
will
stand
for
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
"
then
the
conversation
be
over
,
the
private
secretary
go
away
to
arrange
some
other
little
matter
of
the
kind
,
and
Phineas
Finn
be
leave
alone
to
consider
the
proposition
that
have
be
make
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
to
become
a
member
of
the
British
Parliament
!
<EOS>
in
all
those
hot
contest
at
the
two
debate
club
to
which
he
have
belong
,
this
have
be
the
ambition
which
have
move
him
.
<EOS>
for
,
after
all
,
to
what
purpose
of
their
own
have
those
empty
debate
ever
tend
?
<EOS>
He
and
three
or
four
other
who
have
call
themselves
Liberals
have
be
pit
against
four
or
five
who
have
call
themselves
Conservatives
,
and
night
after
night
they
have
discuss
some
ponderous
subject
without
any
idea
that
one
would
ever
persuade
another
,
or
that
their
talking
would
ever
conduce
to
any
action
or
to
any
result
.
<EOS>
but
each
of
these
combatant
have
feel
,
 
without
dare
to
announce
a
hope
on
the
subject
among
themselves
,
 
that
the
present
arena
be
only
a
trial
-
ground
for
some
possible
great
amphitheatre
,
for
some
future
debate
club
in
which
debate
would
lead
to
action
,
and
in
which
eloquence
would
have
power
,
even
though
persuasion
may
be
out
of
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
certainly
have
never
dare
to
speak
,
even
to
himself
,
of
such
a
hope
.
<EOS>
the
labours
of
the
Bar
have
to
be
encounter
before
the
dawn
of
such
a
hope
could
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
gradually
learn
to
feel
that
his
prospect
at
the
Bar
be
not
as
yet
very
promising
.
<EOS>
as
regarded
professional
work
he
have
be
idle
,
and
how
then
could
he
have
a
hope
?
  
<EOS>
and
now
this
thing
,
which
he
regard
as
be
of
all
thing
in
the
world
the
most
honourable
,
have
come
to
him
all
at
once
,
and
be
possibly
within
his
reach
!
<EOS>
if
he
could
believe
Barrington
Erle
,
he
have
only
to
lift
up
his
hand
,
and
he
may
be
in
Parliament
within
two
month
.
<EOS>
and
who
be
to
be
believe
on
such
a
subject
<EOS>
if
not
Barrington
Erle
?
<EOS>
this
be
Erle
's
special
business
,
and
such
a
man
would
not
have
come
to
him
on
such
a
subject
<EOS>
have
he
not
be
in
earnest
,
and
have
he
not
himself
believe
in
success
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
opening
ready
,
an
opening
to
this
great
glory
,
 
if
only
it
may
be
possible
for
him
to
fill
it
!
  
<EOS>
what
would
his
father
say
?
<EOS>
His
father
would
of
course
oppose
the
plan
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
oppose
his
father
,
his
father
would
of
course
stop
his
income
.
<EOS>
and
such
an
income
as
it
be
!
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
a
man
should
sit
in
Parliament
and
live
upon
a
hundred
and
fifty
pound
a
year
?
<EOS>
since
that
payment
of
his
debt
he
have
become
again
embarrassed
,
 
to
a
slight
amount
.
<EOS>
He
owe
a
tailor
a
trifle
,
and
a
bootmaker
a
trifle
,
 
and
something
to
the
man
who
sell
glove
and
shirt
;
and
yet
he
have
do
his
good
to
keep
out
of
debt
with
more
than
irish
pertinacity
,
live
very
closely
,
breakfast
upon
tea
and
a
roll
,
and
dining
frequently
for
a
shilling
at
a
luncheon
-
house
up
a
court
near
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
where
should
he
dine
if
the
Loughshaners
elect
him
to
Parliament
?
<EOS>
and
then
he
paint
to
himself
a
not
untrue
picture
of
the
probable
misery
of
a
man
who
begin
life
too
high
up
on
the
ladder
,
 
who
succeed
in
mount
before
he
have
learn
how
to
hold
on
when
he
be
aloft
.
<EOS>
for
our
Phineas
Finn
be
a
young
man
not
without
sense
,
 
not
entirely
a
windbag
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
this
thing
the
probability
be
that
he
may
become
utterly
a
castaway
,
and
go
entirely
to
the
dog
before
he
be
thirty
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
of
penniless
man
who
have
get
into
Parliament
,
and
to
whom
have
come
such
a
fate
.
<EOS>
He
be
able
to
name
to
himself
a
man
or
two
<EOS>
whose
bark
,
carry
more
sail
than
they
could
bear
,
have
go
to
piece
among
early
breaker
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
would
it
not
be
well
to
go
to
piece
early
than
never
to
carry
any
sail
at
all
?
<EOS>
and
there
be
,
at
any
rate
,
the
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
He
be
already
a
barrister
,
and
there
be
so
many
thing
open
to
a
barrister
with
a
seat
in
Parliament
!
<EOS>
and
as
he
know
of
man
who
have
be
utterly
ruin
by
such
early
mounting
,
so
also
do
he
know
of
other
whose
fortune
have
be
make
by
happy
audacity
when
they
be
young
.
<EOS>
He
almost
think
that
he
could
die
happy
if
he
have
once
take
his
seat
in
Parliament
,
 
if
he
have
receive
one
letter
with
those
grand
initial
write
after
his
name
on
the
address
.
<EOS>
young
man
in
battle
be
call
upon
to
lead
forlorn
hope
.
<EOS>
three
fall
,
perhaps
,
to
one
who
get
through
;
but
the
one
who
get
through
will
have
the
Victoria
Cross
to
carry
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
forlorn
hope
;
and
as
he
have
be
invite
to
undertake
the
work
,
he
would
not
turn
from
the
danger
.
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
he
again
see
Barrington
Erle
by
appointment
,
and
then
write
the
following
letter
to
his
father
:
    
Reform
Club
,
February
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
father
,
  
I
be
afraid
that
the
purport
of
this
letter
will
startle
you
,
but
I
hope
that
when
you
have
finish
it
you
will
think
that
I
be
right
in
my
decision
as
to
what
I
be
go
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
be
no
doubt
aware
that
the
dissolution
of
Parliament
will
take
place
at
once
,
and
that
we
shall
be
in
all
the
turmoil
of
a
general
election
by
the
middle
of
March
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
invite
to
stand
for
Loughshane
,
and
have
consent
.
<EOS>
the
proposition
have
be
make
to
me
by
my
friend
Barrington
Erle
,
Mr.
Mildmay
's
private
secretary
,
and
have
be
make
on
behalf
of
the
Political
Committee
of
the
Reform
Club
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
should
not
have
think
of
such
a
thing
with
a
less
thorough
promise
of
support
than
this
give
me
,
nor
should
I
think
of
it
<EOS>
now
have
I
not
be
assure
that
none
of
the
expense
of
the
election
would
fall
upon
me
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
could
not
have
ask
you
to
pay
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
such
a
proposition
,
so
make
,
I
have
feel
that
it
would
be
cowardly
to
give
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
regard
such
a
selection
as
a
great
honour
.
<EOS>
I
own
that
I
be
fond
of
politic
,
and
have
take
great
delight
in
their
study
  
(
"
stupid
young
fool
!
"
<EOS>
his
father
say
to
himself
as
he
read
this
)
 
<EOS>
and
it
have
be
my
dream
for
year
past
to
have
a
seat
in
Parliament
at
some
future
time
.
<EOS>
(
"
dream
!
<EOS>
yes
;
I
wonder
whether
he
have
ever
dream
what
he
be
to
live
upon
.
"
)
<EOS>
the
chance
have
now
come
to
me
much
earlier
than
I
have
look
for
it
,
but
I
do
not
think
that
it
should
on
that
account
be
throw
away
.
<EOS>
look
to
my
profession
,
I
find
that
many
thing
be
open
to
a
barrister
with
a
seat
in
Parliament
,
and
that
the
House
nee
not
interfere
much
with
a
man
's
practice
.
<EOS>
(
"
not
if
he
have
get
to
the
top
of
his
tree
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
)
  
<EOS>
My
chief
doubt
arise
from
the
fact
of
your
old
friendship
with
Lord
Tulla
,
whose
brother
have
fill
the
seat
for
I
do
not
know
how
many
year
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
that
George
Morris
must
go
;
or
,
at
least
,
that
he
must
be
oppose
by
a
liberal
candidate
.
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
stand
,
some
one
else
will
,
and
I
should
think
that
Lord
Tulla
will
be
too
much
of
a
man
to
make
any
personal
quarrel
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
to
lose
the
borough
,
why
should
not
I
have
it
as
well
as
another
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
fancy
,
my
dear
father
,
all
that
you
will
say
as
to
my
imprudence
,
and
I
quite
confess
that
I
have
not
a
word
to
answer
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
myself
more
than
once
,
since
last
night
,
that
I
shall
probably
ruin
myself
.
<EOS>
(
"
I
wonder
whether
he
have
ever
tell
himself
that
he
will
probably
ruin
me
also
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
)
<EOS>
but
I
be
prepared
to
ruin
myself
in
such
a
cause
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
one
dependent
on
me
;
and
,
as
long
as
I
do
nothing
to
disgrace
my
name
,
I
may
dispose
of
myself
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
if
you
decide
on
stop
my
allowance
,
I
shall
have
no
feeling
of
anger
against
you
.
<EOS>
(
"
how
very
considerate
!
"
say
the
doctor
.
)
<EOS>
and
in
that
case
I
shall
endeavour
to
support
myself
by
my
pen
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
do
a
little
for
the
magazine
.
  
<EOS>
give
my
good
love
to
my
mother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
receive
me
during
the
time
of
the
election
,
I
shall
see
them
soon
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
will
be
good
for
me
to
say
that
I
have
positively
decide
on
make
the
attempt
;
that
be
to
say
,
if
the
Club
Committee
be
as
good
as
its
promise
.
<EOS>
I
have
weigh
the
matter
all
round
,
and
I
regard
the
prize
as
be
so
great
,
that
I
be
prepared
to
run
any
risk
to
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
me
,
with
my
view
about
politic
,
the
running
of
such
a
risk
be
no
more
than
a
duty
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
keep
my
hand
from
the
work
now
that
the
work
have
come
in
the
way
of
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
most
anxious
to
get
a
line
from
you
in
answer
to
this
.
  
<EOS>
Your
most
affectionate
son
,
  
PHINEAS
FINN
.
  
<EOS>
I
question
whether
Dr.
Finn
,
when
he
read
this
letter
,
do
not
feel
more
of
pride
than
of
anger
,
 
whether
he
be
not
rather
gratify
than
displeased
,
in
spite
of
all
that
his
common
-
sense
tell
him
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
daughter
,
when
they
hear
the
news
,
be
clearly
on
the
side
of
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
immediately
express
an
opinion
that
Parliament
would
be
the
making
of
her
son
,
and
that
everybody
would
be
sure
to
employ
<EOS>
so
distinguish
a
barrister
.
<EOS>
the
girl
declare
that
Phineas
ought
,
at
any
rate
,
to
have
his
chance
,
and
almost
assert
that
it
would
be
brutal
in
their
father
to
stand
in
their
brother
's
way
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
the
doctor
try
to
explain
that
go
into
Parliament
could
not
help
a
young
barrister
,
whatever
it
may
do
for
one
thoroughly
establish
in
his
profession
;
that
Phineas
,
if
successful
at
Loughshane
,
would
at
once
abandon
all
idea
of
earn
any
income
,
 
that
the
proposition
,
come
from
so
poor
a
man
,
be
a
monstrosity
,
 
that
such
an
opposition
to
the
Morris
family
,
come
from
a
son
of
his
,
would
be
gross
ingratitude
to
Lord
Tulla
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
and
the
girl
talk
him
down
,
and
the
doctor
himself
be
almost
carry
away
by
something
like
vanity
in
regard
to
his
son
's
future
position
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
write
a
letter
strongly
advise
Phineas
to
abandon
the
project
.
<EOS>
but
he
himself
be
aware
that
the
letter
which
he
write
be
not
one
from
which
any
success
could
be
expect
.
<EOS>
He
advise
his
son
,
but
do
not
command
him
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
threat
as
to
stop
his
income
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
tell
Phineas
,
in
so
many
word
,
that
he
be
propose
to
make
an
ass
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
argue
very
prudently
against
the
plan
,
and
Phineas
,
when
he
receive
his
father
's
letter
,
of
course
feel
that
it
be
tantamount
to
a
paternal
permission
to
proceed
with
the
matter
.
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
he
get
a
letter
from
his
mother
full
of
affection
,
full
of
pride
,
 
not
exactly
tell
him
to
stand
for
Loughshane
by
all
mean
,
for
Mrs.
Finn
be
not
the
woman
to
run
openly
counter
to
her
husband
in
any
advice
give
by
her
to
their
son
,
 
but
give
him
every
encouragement
which
motherly
affection
and
motherly
pride
could
bestow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
you
will
come
to
us
,
"
she
say
,
"
if
you
do
make
up
your
mind
to
be
member
for
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
We
shall
all
of
us
be
so
delighted
to
have
you
!
"
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
have
fall
into
a
sea
of
doubt
after
write
to
his
father
,
and
who
have
demand
a
week
from
Barrington
Erle
to
consider
the
matter
,
be
elate
to
positive
certainty
by
the
joint
effect
of
the
two
letter
from
home
.
<EOS>
He
understand
it
all
.
<EOS>
His
mother
and
sister
be
altogether
in
favour
of
his
audacity
,
and
even
his
father
be
not
dispose
to
quarrel
with
him
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
you
at
your
word

he
say
to
Barrington
Erle
at
the
club
that
evening

"
what
word

say
Erle
,
who
have
too
many
iron
in
the
fire
to
be

always
of
Loughshane

Phineas
Finn

a
passionate
old
man

the
doctor
expect
that
there
would
be
a
quarrel

he
be
prepared
to
face
that
.
<EOS>
He
be
under
no
special
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
lord
,
have
give
as
much
as
he
have
take
in
the
long
intercourse
which
have
exist
between
them
;
 
and
he
agree
with
his
son
in
think
that
if
there
be
to
be
a
liberal
candidate
at
Loughshane
,
no
consideration
of
old
pill
-
box
and
gallipot
should
deter
his
son
Phineas
from
stand
.
<EOS>
other
consideration
may
very
probably
deter
him
,
but
not
that
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
probably
would
be
of
a
different
opinion
,
and
the
doctor
feel
it
to
be
incumbent
on
him
to
break
the
news
to
Lord
Tulla
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
devil
he

the

have
tell
his
story

then
I
will
tell
you
what

I

support
him

You
support
him
,
Lord
Tulla

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
why
should
not
I
support
him
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
not
so
bad
with
me
in
the
country
that
my
support
will
rob
him
of
his
chance

I
will
tell
you
one
thing
for
certain
,
I
will
not

George
Morris

I

at

there
be
not
a

Ireland
stauncher

anything
again

Dr.

all
about
Dick

who

hear
of
his

preaching
,
be
not
surprised
at
the
decision
of
the
conservative
bestower
of
irish
Church
patronage

on
this
subject
he

nothing

as
for
George

I
will
never
lift
my
hand
again

His
standing

<EOS>
the

promise
that
his

should
ride
over
to
Castlemorris
,
and
then
take
his
leave
,
 
not
specially
flatter
,
as
he
feel
that
be
his

the

the
remainder

aware
that
the
great
impediment
in
his

way

<EOS>
He
certainly
have
not
go
to
Castlemorris
with
any
idea

canvass
for
his

he
have
canvass
for
him
most
satisfactorily

home

he

not

otherwise

Mr.

You

to
do
the
good
I
can
for
the
country

so

I
shall
tell
the

the

"
  
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
turn
away
in
disgust
.
<EOS>
such
language
be
to
him
simply
disgusting
.
<EOS>
It
fall
upon
his
ear
as
false
maudlin
sentiment
fall
on
the
ear
of
the
ordinary
honest
man
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
be
a
man
ordinarily
honest
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
be
untrue
to
his
mother
's
brother
,
William
Mildmay
,
the
great
Whig
Minister
of
the
day
,
for
any
earthly
consideration
.
<EOS>
He
be
ready
to
work
with
wage
or
without
wage
.
<EOS>
He
be
really
zealous
in
the
cause
,
not
ask
very
much
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
some
undefined
belief
that
it
be
much
well
for
the
country
that
Mr.
Mildmay
should
be
in
power
than
that
Lord
de
Terrier
should
be
there
.
<EOS>
He
be
convince
that
liberal
politic
be
good
for
Englishmen
,
and
that
liberal
politic
and
the
Mildmay
party
be
one
and
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
unfair
to
Barrington
Erle
to
deny
to
him
some
praise
for
patriotism
.
<EOS>
but
he
hate
the
very
name
of
independence
in
Parliament
,
and
when
he
be
tell
of
any
man
,
that
that
man
intend
to
look
to
measure
and
not
to
man
,
he
regard
that
man
as
be
both
unstable
as
water
and
dishonest
as
the
wind
.
<EOS>
no
good
could
possibly
come
from
such
a
one
,
and
much
evil
might
and
probably
would
come
.
<EOS>
such
a
politician
be
a
Greek
to
Barrington
Erle
,
from
whose
hand
he
fear
to
accept
even
the
gift
of
a
vote
.
<EOS>
parliamentary
hermit
be
distasteful
to
him
,
and
dweller
in
political
cave
be
regard
by
him
with
aversion
as
be
either
knavish
or
impractical
.
<EOS>
with
a
good
conservative
opponent
he
could
shake
hand
almost
as
readily
as
with
a
good
Whig
ally
;
but
the
man
who
be
neither
flesh
nor
fowl
be
odious
to
him
.
<EOS>
accord
to
his
theory
of
parliamentary
government
,
the
House
of
Commons
should
be
divide
by
a
mark
line
,
and
every
member
should
be
require
to
stand
on
one
side
of
it
or
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
if
not
with
me
,
at
any
rate
be
against
me
,
"
he
would
have
say
to
every
representative
of
the
people
in
the
name
of
the
great
leader
whom
he
follow
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
debate
be
good
,
because
of
the
people
outside
,
 
because
they
serve
to
create
that
public
opinion
which
be
hereafter
to
be
use
in
create
some
future
House
of
Commons
;
but
he
do
not
think
it
possible
that
any
vote
should
be
give
on
a
great
question
,
either
this
way
or
that
,
as
the
result
of
a
debate
;
and
he
be
certainly
assure
in
his
own
opinion
that
any
such
changing
of
vote
would
be
dangerous
,
revolutionary
,
and
almost
unparliamentary
.
<EOS>
a
member
's
vote
,
 
except
on
some
small
crotchety
open
question
throw
out
for
the
amusement
of
crotchety
member
,
 
be
due
to
the
leader
of
that
member
's
party
.
<EOS>
such
be
Mr.
Erle
's
idea
of
the
english
system
of
Parliament
,
and
,
lend
semi
-
official
assistance
as
he
do
frequently
to
the
introduction
of
candidate
into
the
House
,
he
be
naturally
anxious
that
his
candidate
should
be
candidate
after
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
Phineas
Finn
talk
of
measure
and
not
man
,
Barrington
Erle
turn
away
in
open
disgust
.
<EOS>
but
he
remember
the
youth
and
extreme
rawness
of
the
lad
,
and
he
remember
also
the
career
of
other
man
.
  
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
be
forty
,
and
experience
have
teach
him
something
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
second
,
he
bring
himself
to
think
mildly
of
the
young
man
's
vanity
,
 
as
of
the
vanity
of
a
plunge
colt
who
resent
the
liberty
even
of
a
touch
.
<EOS>
"
by
the
end
of
the
first
session
the
thong
will
be
crack
over
his
head
,
as
he
patiently
assist
in
pull
the
coach
up
hill
,
without
produce
from
him
even
a
flick
of
his
tail
,
"
say
Barrington
Erle
to
an
old
parliamentary
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
to
come
out
after
all
on
the
wrong
side
,
"
say
the
parliamentary
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Erle
admit
that
such
a
trick
as
that
would
be
unpleasant
,
but
he
think
that
old
Lord
Tulla
be
hardly
equal
to
so
clever
a
stratagem
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
go
to
Ireland
,
and
walk
over
the
course
at
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
He
call
upon
Lord
Tulla
,
and
hear
that
venerable
nobleman
talk
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
.
<EOS>
to
tell
the
truth
of
Phineas
,
I
must
confess
that
he
wish
to
talk
the
nonsense
himself
;
but
the
Earl
would
not
hear
him
,
and
put
him
down
very
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
discuss
politic
,
if
you
please
,
Mr.
Finn
;
because
,
as
I
have
already
say
,
I
be
throw
aside
all
political
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
,
therefore
,
be
not
allow
to
express
his
view
on
the
government
of
the
country
in
the
Earl
's
sitting
-
room
at
Castlemorris
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
a
good
time
come
;
and
so
,
for
the
present
,
he
allow
the
Earl
to
ramble
on
about
the
sin
of
his
brother
George
,
and
the
want
of
all
proper
pedigree
on
the
part
of
the
new
Dean
of
Kilfenora
.
<EOS>
the
conference
end
with
an
assurance
on
the
part
of
Lord
Tulla
that
if
the
Loughshaners
choose
to
elect
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
he
would
not
be
in
the
least
offended
.
<EOS>
the
elector
do
elect
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
,
 
perhaps
for
the
reason
give
by
one
of
the
Dublin
conservative
paper
,
which
declare
that
it
be
all
the
fault
of
the
Carlton
Club
in
not
send
a
proper
candidate
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
say
about
the
matter
,
both
in
London
and
Dublin
,
and
the
blame
be
suppose
to
fall
on
the
joint
shoulder
of
George
Morris
and
his
eld
brother
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
our
hero
,
Phineas
Finn
,
have
be
duly
elect
member
of
Parliament
for
the
borough
of
Loughshane
.
  
<EOS>
the
Finn
family
could
not
restrain
their
triumphing
at
Killaloe
,
and
I
do
not
know
that
it
would
have
be
natural
have
they
do
so
.
<EOS>
a
gosling
from
such
a
flock
do
become
something
of
a
real
swan
by
get
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
his
misgiving
,
 
have
great
misgiving
,
fearful
foreboding
;
but
there
be
the
young
man
elect
,
and
he
could
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
refuse
his
right
hand
to
his
son
or
withdraw
his
paternal
assistance
because
that
son
have
be
specially
honour
among
the
young

of

<EOS>
so
he
pull
out
of
his
hoard
what
suffice
to
pay
off
outstanding
debt

<EOS>
they
be
not
heavy
,
 
and
undertake
to
allow
Phineas
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
a
year
as
long
as

should

"
  
<EOS>
Mary
Flood
Jones
be
a
little
girl
about
twenty
year
of
age
,
with
the
soft
hair
in
the
world
,
of
a
colour
varying
between
brown
and
auburn
,
 
for
sometimes
you
would
swear
it
be
the
one
and
sometimes
the
other
;
and
she
be
as
pretty
as
ever
<EOS>
she
could
be
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
those
girl
,
so
common
in
Ireland
,
whom
man
,
with
taste
that
way
give
,
feel
inclined
to
take
up
and
devour
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
;
and
when
she
like
her
lion
,
she
have
a
look
about
her
which
seem
to
ask
to
be
devour
.
<EOS>
there
be
girl
so
cold
-
look
,
 
<EOS>
pretty
girl
,
too
,
ladylike
,
discreet
,
and
arm
with
all
accomplishment
,
 
whom
to
attack
seem
to
require
the
same
sort
of
courage
,
and
the
same
sort
of
preparation
,
as
a
journey
in
quest
of
the
north
-
west
passage
.
<EOS>
one
think
of
a
pedestal
near
the
Athenaeum
as
the
most
appropriate
and
most
honourable
reward
of
such
courage
.
<EOS>
but
,
again
,
there
be
other
girl
to
abstain
from
attack
whom
be
,
to
a
man
of
any
warmth
of
temperament
,
quite
impossible
.
<EOS>
They
be
like
water
when
one
be
athirst
,
like
plover
'
egg
in
March
,
like
cigar
when
one
be
out
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
no
one
ever
dream
of
deny
himself
when
such
temptation
come
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
It
often
happen
,
however
,
that
in
spite
of
appearance
,
the
water
will
not
come
from
the
well
,
nor
the
egg
from
its
shell
,
nor
will
the
cigar
allow
itself
to
be
light
.
<EOS>
a
girl
of
such
appearance
,
so
charming
,
be
Mary
Flood
Jones
of
Killaloe
,
and
our
hero
Phineas
be
not
allow
to
thirst
in
vain
for
a
drop
from
the
cool
spring
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
girl
go
down
into
the
drawing
-
room
Mary
be
careful
to
go
to
a
part
of
the
room
quite
remote
from
Phineas
,
so
as
to
seat
herself
between
Mrs.
Finn
and
Dr.
Finn
's
young
partner
,
Mr.
Elias
Bodkin
,
from
Ballinasloe
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Finn
and
the
Miss
Finns
and
all
Killaloe
know
that
Mary
have
no
love
for
Mr.
Bodkin
,
and
when
Mr.
Bodkin
hand
her
the
hot
cake
<EOS>
she
hardly
so
much
as
smile
at
him
.
<EOS>
but
in
two
minute
Phineas
be
behind
her
chair
,
and
then
she
smile
;
and
<EOS>
in
five
minute
more
she
have
get
herself
so
twisted
round
that
she
be
sit
in
a
corner
with
Phineas
and
his
sister
Barbara
;
and
in
two
more
minute
Barbara
have
return
to
Mr.
Elias
Bodkin
,
so
that
Phineas
and
Mary
be
uninterrupted
.
<EOS>
They
manage
these
thing
very
quickly
and
very
cleverly
in
Killaloe
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
off

early

soon

I
do

so
hope

not

about

nonsense

would
look

stand
by
you

because
I
be
so
insignificant

small

<EOS>
"

because
your

be
perfect

and
because
she
be
straggle

<EOS>
She
be
as
unlike
you
as
possible
in
everything

<EOS>
She
have
thick
lumpy
red
hair
,
while
yours
be
all
silk
and
softness

<EOS>
She
have
large
hand

foot
,

"
  
"
why
,
Phineas

you
be
make
her
out
to
be
an
ogress

yet
I
know

you
admire
her

so
I
do

she
possess
such
an
appearance

power

after
all
,
in
spite
of
the
lumpy
hair

large
hand

figure
,
she
be
handsome

<EOS>
one
can
not
tell
what
it
be

<EOS>
one
can
see

she
be
quite
contented

fifty

soon

all
 
be
so
 
glad

"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
do
not
say
a
word
further
then
.
<EOS>
perhaps
some
commotion
among
the
party
break
up
the
little
private
conversation
in
the
corner
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
not
alone
with
Mary
again
till
there
come
a
moment
for
him
to
put
her
cloak
over
her
shoulder
in
the
back
parlour
,
while
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
be
finish
some
important
narrative
to
his
mother
.
<EOS>
It
be
Barbara
,
I
think
,
who
stand
in
some
doorway
,
and
prevent
people
from
pass
,
and
so
give
him
the
opportunity
which
he
abuse
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
say
he
,
take
her
in
his
arm
,
without
a
single
word
of
love
-
make
beyond
what
the
reader
have
hear
,
 
"
one
kiss
before
we
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Phineas
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
but
the
kiss
have
be
take
and
give
before
she
have
even
answer
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Phineas
,
you
should
not
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
.
<EOS>
why
should
not
I
?
<EOS>
and
,
Mary
,
I
will
have
one
morsel
of
your
hair
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
;
indeed
you
shall
not
!

<EOS>
but
the
scissor
be
at
hand
,
and
the
ringlet
be
cut
and
in
his
pocket
before
she
be
ready
with
her
resistance
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
further
;
 
not
a
word
more
,
and
Mary
go
away
with
her
veil
down
,
under
her
mother
's
wing
,
weep
sweet
silent
tear
which
no

yourself

up

old
girl

me
off

the
morning

<EOS>
everybody
be
up
to
see
him
off
in
the
morning
,
to
give
him
coffee
and
good
advice
,
and
kiss
,
and
to
throw
all
manner
of
old
shoe
after
him
as
he
start
on
his
great
expedition
to
Parliament
.
<EOS>
His
father
give
him
an
extra
twenty
-
pound
note
,
and
beg
him
for
God
's
sake
to
be
careful
about
his
money

mother
tell
him
always
to
have
an
orange
in
his
pocket
when
he
intend
to
speak
longer
than
usual

Barbara
in
a
last
whisper
beg
him
never
to
forget
dear
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
   
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
take
His
seat
 
<EOS>
Phineas
have
many
serious
,
almost
solemn
thought
on
his
journey
towards
London
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
I
must
assure
my
female
reader
that
very
few
of
them
have
reference
to
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
very
carefully
pack
up
the
tress
,
and
could
bring
that
out
for
proper
act
of
erotic
worship
at
season
in
which
his
mind
may
be
less
engage
with
affair
of
state
than
it
be
at
present
.
<EOS>
Would
he
make
a
failure
of
this
great
matter
which
he
have
take
in
hand
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
tell
himself
that
the
chance
be
twenty
to
one
against
him
.
<EOS>
now
that
he
look
near
at
it
all
,
the
difficulty
loom
larger
than
ever
,
and
the
reward
seem
to
be
less
,
more
difficult
of
approach
,
and
more
evanescent
.
<EOS>
how
many
member
be
there
who
could
never
get
a
hearing
!
<EOS>
how
many
who
only
speak
to
fail
!
<EOS>
how
many
,
who
speak
well
,
who
could
speak
to
no
effect
as
far
as
their
own
worldly
prospect
be
concern
!
<EOS>
He
have
already
know
many
member
of
Parliament
to
whom
no
outward
respect
or
sign
of
honour
be
ever
give
by
any
one
;
and
it
seem
to
him
,
as
he
think
over
it
,
that
irish
member
of
Parliament
be
generally
treat
with
more
indifference
than
any
other
.
<EOS>
there
be
o'b---
and
O'C---
and
o'd
 
,
for
whom
no
one
care
a
straw
,
who
could
hardly
get
man
to
dine
with
them
at
the
club
,
and
yet
they
be
genuine
member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
ever
be
well
than
O'B
 
,
or
O'C
 
,
or
o'd
 
?
<EOS>
and
in
what
way
should
he
begin
to
be
well
?
<EOS>
He
have
an
idea
of
the
fashion
after
which
it
would
be
his
duty
to
strive
that
he
may
excel
those
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
give
any
of
them
credit
for
much
earnestness
in
their
country
's
behalf
,
and
he
be
minded
to
be
very
earnest
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
to
his
work
honestly
and
conscientiously
,
determine
to
do
his
duty
as
best
he
may
,
let
the
result
to
himself
be
what
they
would
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
noble
resolution
,
and
may
have
be
pleasant
to
him
,
 
have
he
not
remember
that
smile
of
derision
which
have
come
over
his
friend
Erle
's
face
when
he
declare
his
intention
of
do
his
duty
to
his
country
as
a
Liberal
,
and
not
of
support
a
party
.
<EOS>
o'b---
and
O'C---
and
O'D---
be
keen
enough
to
support
their
party
,
only
they
be
sometimes
a
little
astray
at
know
which
be
their
party
for
the
nonce
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
Erle
and
such
man
would
despise
him
if
he
do
not
fall
into
the
regular
groove
,
 
and
if
the
Barrington
Erles
despise
him
,
what
would
then
be
leave
for
him
?
  
<EOS>
His
moody
thought
be
somewhat
dissipated
when
he
find
one
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
 
the
honourable
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
 
a
special
friend
of
his
own
,
and
a
very
clever
fellow
,
on
board
the
boat
as
it
steam
out
of
Kingston
harbour
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
have
also
just
be
over
about
his
election
,
and
have
be
return
as
a
matter
of
course
for
his
father
's
county
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
have
sit
in
the
House
for
the
last
fifteen
year
,
and
be
yet
well
-
nigh
as
young
a
man
as
any
in
it
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
a
man
altogether
different
from
the
O'B
 
s
,
O'C
 
s
,
and
o'd
 
s.
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
could
always
get
the
ear
of
the
House
if
he
choose
to
speak
,
and
his
friend
declare
that
he
may
have
be
high
up
in
office
long
since
if
he
would
have
take
the
trouble
to
work
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
welcome
guest
at
the
house
of
the
very
good
people
,
and
be
a
friend
of
whom
any
one
may
be
proud
.
<EOS>
It
have
for
two
year
be
a
feather
in
the
cap
of
Phineas
that
he
know
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
and
yet
people
say
that
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
have
nothing
of
his
own
,
and
man
wonder
how
he
live
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
young
son
of
Lord
Claddagh
,
an
irish
peer
with
a
large
family
,
who
could
do
nothing
for
Laurence
,
his
favourite
child
,
beyond
find
him
a
seat
in
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Finn
,
my
boy
,
"
say
Laurence
,
shake
hand
with
the
young
member
on
board
the
steamer
,
"
<EOS>
so
you
have
make
it
all
right
at
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
"
then
Phineas
be
begin
to
tell
all
the
story
,
the
wonderful
story
,
of
George
Morris
and
the
Earl
of
Tulla
,
 
how
the
man
of
Loughshane
have
elect
him
without
opposition
;
how
he
have
be
support
by
conservative
as
well
as
Liberals
;
 
how
unanimous
Loughshane
have
be
in
elect
him
,
Phineas
Finn
,
as
its
representative
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
seem
to
care
very
little
about
all
this
,
and
go
so
far
as
to
declare
that
those
thing
be
accident
which
fall
out
sometimes
one
way
and
sometimes
another
,
and
be
altogether
independent
of
any
merit
or
demerit
on
the
part
of
the
candidate
himself
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
marvellous
and
almost
painful
to
Phineas
that
his
friend
Fitzgibbon
should
accept
the
fact
of
his
membership
with
so
little
of
congratulation
,
 
with
absolutely
no
blowing
of
trumpet
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
elect
a
member
of
the
municipal
corporation
of
Loughshane
,
instead
of
its
representative
in
the
British
Parliament
,
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
could
not
have
make
less
fuss
about
it
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
disappoint
,
but
he
take
the
cue
from
his
friend
too
quickly
to
show
his
disappointment
.
<EOS>
and
when
,
half
an
hour
after
their
meeting
,
Fitzgibbon
have
to
be
remind
that
his
companion
be
not
in
the
House
during
the
last
session
,
Phineas
be
able
to
make
the
remark
as
though
he
think
as
little
about
the
House
as
do
the
old
-
accustomed
member
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
far
as
I
can
see
as
yet
,
"
say
Fitzgibbon
,
"
we
be
sure
to
have
seventeen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
seventeen
?
"
say
Phineas
,
not
quite
understand
the
meaning
of
the
number
quote
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
majority
of
seventeen
.
<EOS>
there
be
four
irish
county
and
three
Scotch
which
have
not
return
as
yet
;
but
we
know
pretty
well
what
they
will
do
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
doubt
about
Tipperary
,
of
course
,
but
whichever
get
in
of
the
seven
who
be
stand
,
it
will
be
a
vote
on
our
side
.
<EOS>
now
the
Government
can
not
live
against
that
.
<EOS>
the
uphill
strain
be
too
much
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
accord
to
my
idea
,
nothing
can
justify
them
in
try
to
live
against
a
majority
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
gammon
.
<EOS>
when
the
thing
be
so
equal
,
anything
be
fair
.
<EOS>
but
you
see
they
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
of
course
there
be
some
among
them
as
hungry
as
we
be
;
and
Dubby
would
give
his
toe
and
finger
to
remain
in
.
<EOS>
"
Dubby
be
the
ordinary
name
by
which
,
among
friend
and
foe
,
Mr.
Daubeny
be
know
:
Mr.
Daubeny
,
who
at
that
time
be
the
leader
of
the
conservative
party
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
"
<EOS>
but
most
of
them
,
"
continue
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
,
"
prefer
the
other
game
,
and
if
you
do
not
care
about
money
,
upon
my
word
<EOS>
it
be
the
pleasanter
game
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
country
get
nothing
do
by
a
Tory
Government
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
that
,
it
be
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
a
government
yet
that
want
to
do
anything
.
<EOS>
give
a
government
a
real
strong
majority
,
as
the
Tories
use
to
have
half
a
century
since
,
and
as
a
matter
of
course
it
will
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
why
should
it
?
<EOS>
do
thing
,
as
you
call
it
,
be
only
bid
for
power
,
 
for
patronage
and
pay
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
be
the
country
to
have
no
service
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
country
get
quite
as
much
service
as
it
pay
for
,
 
and
perhaps
a
little
more
.
<EOS>
the
clerk
in
the
office
work
for
the
country
.
<EOS>
and
the
Ministers
work
too
,
if
they
have
get
anything
to
manage
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
work
do
;
 
but
of
work
in
Parliament
,
the
less
the
well
,
accord
to
my
idea
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
little
that
ever
be
do
,
and
that
little
be
generally
too
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
people
 
"
  
"
come
down
and
have
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
leave
the
people
alone
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
the
people
can
take
care
of
themselves
a
great
deal
better
than
we
can
take
care
of
them
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
's
doctrine
as
to
the
commonwealth
be
very
different
from
that
of
Barrington
Erle
,
and
be
still
less
to
the
taste
of
the
new
member
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
consider
that
his
leader
,
Mr.
Mildmay
,
should
be
intrust
to
make
all
necessary
change
in
the
law
,
and
that
an
obedient
House
of
Commons
should
implicitly
obey
that
leader
in
authorise
all
change
propose
by
him
;
 
but
accord
to
Barrington
Erle
,
such
change
should
be
numerous
and
of
great
importance
,
and
would
,
if
duly
pass
into
law
at
his
lord
's
behest
,
gradually
produce
such
a
Whig
Utopia
in
England
as
have
never
yet
be
see
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
now
,
accord
to
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
,
the
present
Utopia
would
be
good
enough
,
 
if
only
he
himself
may
be
once
more
put
into
possession
of
a
certain
semi
-
political
place
about
the
Court
,
from
which
he
have
heretofore
draw
£
1,000
per
annum
,
without
any
work
,
much
to
his
comfort
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
secret
of
his
ambition
,
and
be
chagrin
simply
at
the
prospect
of
have
to
return
to
his
elector
before
he
could
enjoy
those
good
thing
which
he
expect
to
receive
from
the
undoubted
majority
of
seventeen
,
which
have
be
,
or
would
be
,
achieve
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
all
change
as
a
rule
,
"
say
Fitzgibbon
;
"
but
,
upon
my
word
,
we
ought
to
alter
that
.
<EOS>
when
a
fellow
have
get
a
crumb
of
comfort
,
after
wait
for
it
year
and
year
,
and
perhaps
spend
thousand
in
election
,
he
have
to
go
back
and
try
his
hand
again
at
the
last
moment
,
merely
in
obedience
to
some
antiquated
prejudice
.
<EOS>
look
at
poor
Jack
Bond
,
 
the
good
friend
I
ever
have
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
be
wreck
upon
that
rock
for
ever
.
<EOS>
He
spend
every
shilling
he
have
in
contest
Romford
three
time
run
,
 
and
three
time
run
<EOS>
he
get
in
.
<EOS>
then
they
make
him
Vice
-
Comptroller
of
the
Granaries
,
and
I
be
shoot
if
he
do
not
get
spilt
at
Romford
on
stand
for
his
re
-
election
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
become
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
know
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
hear
that
he
marry
an
old
woman
and
settle
down
somewhere
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
never
come
up
again
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
call
that
a
confound
shame
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
be
safe
down
in
Mayo
,
but
there
be
no
knowing
what
may
happen
in
these
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
they
part
at
Euston
Square
,
Phineas
ask
his
friend
some
little
nervous
question
as
to
the
good
mode
of
make
a
first
entrance
into
the
House
.
<EOS>
Would
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
see
him
through
the
difficulty
of
the
oath
-
taking
?
<EOS>
but
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
make
very
little
of
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
oh
;
 
you
just
come
down
,
and
there
will
be
a
rush
of
fellow
,
and
you
will
know
everybody
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
hang
about
for
an
hour
or
so
,
and
then
you
will
get
push
through
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
time
for
much
ceremony
after
a
general
election
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
reach
London
early
in
the
morning
,
and
go
home
to
bed
for
an
hour
or
so
.
<EOS>
the
House
be
to
meet
on
that
very
day
,
and
he
intend
to
begin
his
parliamentary
duty
at
once
if
he
should
find
it
possible
to
get
some
one
to
accompany
him
;
He
feel
that
he
should
lack
courage
to
go
down
to
Westminster
Hall
alone
,
and
explain
to
the
policeman
and
door
-
keeper
that
he
be
the
man
who
have
just
be
elect
member
for
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
so
about
noon
he
go
into
the
Reform
Club
,
and
there
he
find
a
great
crowd
of
man
,
among
whom
there
be
a
plentiful
sprinkling
of
member
.
<EOS>
Erle
see
him
in
a
moment
,
and
come
to
him
with
congratulation
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
be
all
right
,
Finn
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
I
be
all
right
,
 
I
do
not
have
much
doubt
about
it
when
I
go
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
of
a
fellow
with
such
a
run
of
luck
,
"
say
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
one
of
those
fluke
that
occur
once
in
a
dozen
election
.
<EOS>
any
one
on
earth
may
have
get
in
without
spend
a
shilling

"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
do
not
at
all
like
this
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
any
one
could
have
get
in
,

say
he
,
"
without
know
Lord
Tulla

<EOS>
"
  
"
Lord
Tulla
be
nowhere

my

could
have
nothing
to

to
it

but
never
mind
that
.
<EOS>
You
meet
me
in
the
lobby
at
two
.
<EOS>
there
will
be
a
lot
of
us
there
,
and
we
will
go
in
together
.
<EOS>
have
you
see
Fitzgibbon
?
"
<EOS>
then
Barrington
Erle
go
off
to
other
business
,
and
Finn
be
congratulate
by
other
man
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
to
him
that
the
congratulation
of
his
friend
be
not
hearty
.
<EOS>
He
speak
to
some
man
,
of
whom
he
think
that
he
know
they
would
have
give
their
eye
to
be
in
Parliament
;
 
and
yet
they
speak
of
his
success
as
be
a
very
ordinary
thing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
my
boy
,
I
hope
you
like
it
,
"
say
one
middle
-
aged
gentleman
whom
he
have
know
ever
since
he
come
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
the
difference
be
between
work
for
nothing
and
work
for
money
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
work
for
nothing
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
about
it
,
I
suppose
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
the
House
be
a
comfortable
club
,
"
say
the
middle
-
aged
friend
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
confess
that
I
should
not
like
be
ring
away
from
my
dinner
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
two
punctually
Phineas
be
in
the
lobby
at
Westminster
,
and
then
he
find
himself
take
into
the
House
with
a
crowd
of
other
man
.
<EOS>
the
old
and
young
,
and
they
who
be
neither
old
nor
young
,
be
mingle
together
,
and
there
seem
to
be
very
little
respect
of
person
.
<EOS>
on
three
or
four
occasion
there
be
some
cheering
when
a
popular
man
or
a
great
leader
come
in
;
but
the
work
of
the
day
leave
but
little
clear
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
young
member
.
<EOS>
He
be
confused
,
half
elated
,
half
disappointed
,
and
have
not
his
wit
about
him
.
<EOS>
He
find
himself
constantly
regret
that
he
be
there
;
and
as
constantly
tell
himself
that
he
,
hardly
yet
twenty
-
five
,
without
a
shilling
of
his
own
,
have
achieve
an
entrance
into
that
assembly
which
by
the
consent
of
all
man
be
the
great
in
the
world
,
and
which
many
of
the
rich
magnate
of
the
country
have
in
vain
spend
heap
of
treasure
in
their
endeavour
to
open
to
their
own
footstep
.
<EOS>
He
try
hard
to
realise
what
he
have
gain
,
but
the
dust
and
the
noise
and
the
crowd
and
the
want
of
something
august
to
the
eye
be
almost
too
strong
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
manage
,
however
,
to
take
the
oath
early
among
those
who
take
it
,
and
hear
the
Queen
's
speech
read
and
the
address
move
and
second
.
<EOS>
He
be
seat
very
uncomfortably
,
high
up
on
a
back
seat
,
between
two
man
whom
he
do
not
know
;
and
he
find
the
speech
to
be
very
long
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
the
habit
of
see
such
speech
report
in
about
a
column
,
and
he
think
that
these
speech
must
take
at
least
four
column
each
.
<EOS>
He
sit
out
the
debate
on
the
Address
till
the
House
be
adjourn
,
and
then
he
go
away
to
dine
at
his
club
.
<EOS>
He
do
go
into
the
dining
-
room
of
the
House
,
but
there
be
a
crowd
there
,
and
he
find
himself
alone
,
 
and
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
be
afraid
to
order
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
the
near
approach
to
a
triumph
which
he
have
in
London
come
to
him
from
the
glory
which
his
election
reflect
upon
his
landlady
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
kindly
good
motherly
soul
,
whose
husband
be
a
journeyman
law
-
stationer
,
and
who
keep
a
very
decent
house
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
.
<EOS>
here
Phineas
have
lodge
since
he
have
be
in
London
,
and
be
a
great
favourite
.
<EOS>
"
God
bless
my
soul
,
Mr.
Phineas
,
"
say
she
,
"
only
think
of
your
be
a
member
of
Parliament
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
a
member
of
Parliament
,
Mrs.
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
go
on
with
the
room
the
same
as
ever
?
<EOS>
well
,
I
never
think
to
have
a
member
of
Parliament
in
'
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunce
really
have
realise
the
magnitude
of
the
step
which
her
lodger
have
take
,
and
Phineas
be
grateful
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
Standish
 
Phineas
,
in
describe
Lady
Laura
Standish
to
Mary
Flood
Jones
at
Killaloe
,
have
not
paint
her
in
very
glowing
colour
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
admire
Lady
Laura
very
much
,
and
she
be
worthy
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
It
be
probably
the
great
pride
of
our
hero
's
life
that
Lady
Laura
Standish
be
his
friend
,
and
that
she
have
instigate
him
to
undertake
the
risk
of
parliamentary
life
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
be
intimate
also
with
Barrington
Erle
,
who
be
,
in
some
distant
degree
,
her
cousin
;
and
Phineas
be
not
without
a
suspicion
that
his
selection
for
Loughshane
,
from
out
of
all
the
young
liberal
candidate
,
may
have
be
in
some
degree
owe
to
Lady
Laura
's
influence
with
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
unwilling
that
it
should
be
so
;
for
though
,
as
he
have
repeatedly
tell
himself
,
he
be
by
no
mean
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
,
 
who
be
,
as
he
imagine
,
somewhat
old
than
himself
,
 
nevertheless
,
he
would
feel
gratified
at
accept
anything
from
her
hand
,
and
he
feel
a
keen
desire
for
some
increase
to
those
tie
of
friendship
which
bind
them
together
.
<EOS>
no
;
 
he
be
not
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
the
remote
idea
of
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
so
he
tell
himself
,
both
before
he
go
over
for
his
election
,
and
after
his
return
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
find
himself
in
a
corner
with
poor
little
Mary
Flood
Jones
,
he
have
kiss
her
as
a
matter
of
course
;
but
he
do
not
think
that
he
could
,
in
any
circumstance
,
be
tempt
to
kiss
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
suppose
that
he
be
in
love
with
his
darle
little
Mary
,
 
after
a
fashion
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
it
could
never
come
to
anything
,
because
of
the
circumstance
of
his
life
,
which
be
so
imperious
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
,
and
yet
he
hope
that
his
intimacy
with
her
may
come
to
much
.
<EOS>
He
have
more
than
once
ask
himself
how
he
would
feel
when
somebody
else
come
to
be
really
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
,
 
for
she
be
by
no
mean
a
woman
to
lack
lover
,
 
when
some
one
else
should
be
in
love
with
her
,
and
be
receive
by
her
as
a
lover
;
but
this
question
he
have
never
be
able
to
answer
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
question
about
himself
which
he
usually
answer
by
tell
himself
that
it
be
his
fate
to
walk
over
volcano
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
I
shall
be
blow
into
atom
some
fine
day
,
"
he
would
say
;
"
but
after
all
,
that
be
well
than
be
slowly
boil
down
into
pulp
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
House
have
meet
on
a
Friday
,
again
on
the
Saturday
morning
,
and
the
debate
on
the
Address
have
be
adjourn
till
the
Monday
.
<EOS>
on
the
Sunday
,
Phineas
determine
that
he
would
see
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
She
profess
to
be
always
at
home
on
Sunday
,
and
from
three
to
four
in
the
afternoon
her
drawing
-
room
would
probably
be
half
full
of
people
.
<EOS>
there
would
,
at
any
rate
,
be
comer
and
goer
,
who
would
prevent
anything
like
real
conversation
between
himself
and
her
.
<EOS>
but
for
a
few
minute
before
that
he
may
probably
find
her
alone
,
and
he
be
most
anxious
to
see
whether
her
reception
of
him
,
as
a
member
of
Parliament
,
would
be
in
any
degree
warm
than
that
of
his
other
friend
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
have
find
no
such
warmth
since
he
come
to
London
,
except
that
which
have
glow
in
the
bosom
of
Mrs.
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
Standish
be
the
daughter
of
the
Earl
of
Brentford
,
and
be
the
only
remain
lady
of
the
Earl
's
family
.
<EOS>
the
Countess
have
be
long
dead
;
and
Lady
Emily
,
the
young
daughter
,
who
have
be
the
great
beauty
of
her
day
,
be
now
the
wife
of
a
russian
nobleman
whom
she
have
persist
in
prefer
to
any
of
her
english
suitor
,
and
live
at
St.
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
aunt
,
old
Lady
Laura
,
who
come
up
to
town
about
the
middle
of
May
;
but
she
be
always
in
the
country
except
for
some
six
week
in
the
season
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
Lord
Chiltern
,
the
Earl
's
son
and
heir
,
who
do
indeed
live
at
the
family
town
house
in
Portman
Square
;
but
Lord
Chiltern
be
a
man
of
whom
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
's
set
do
not
often
speak
,
and
Phineas
,
frequently
as
he
have
be
at
the
house
,
have
never
see
Lord
Chiltern
there
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
nobleman
of
whom
various
account
be
give
by
various
people
;
but
I
fear
that
the
account
most
readily
accept
in
London
attribute
to
him
a
great
intimacy
with
the
affair
at
Newmarket
,
and
a
partiality
for
convivial
pleasure
.
<EOS>
respect
Lord
Chiltern
Phineas
have
never
as
yet
exchange
a
word
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
with
her
father
he
be
acquaint
,
as
he
have
dine
perhaps
half
a
dozen
time
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
point
in
Lord
Brentford
's
character
which
have
more
than
any
other
strike
our
hero
,
be
the
unlimited
confidence
which
he
seem
to
place
in
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
seem
to
have
perfect
power
of
do
what
she
please
.
<EOS>
She
be
much
more
mistress
of
herself
than
if
she
have
be
the
wife
instead
of
the
daughter
of
the
Earl
of
Brentford
,
 
and
she
seem
to
be
quite
as
much
mistress
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
have
declare
at
Killaloe
that
Lady
Laura
be
six
foot
high
,
that
she
have
red
hair
,
that
her
figure
be
straggle
,
and
that
her
hand
and
foot
be
large
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
fact
about
five
foot
seven
in
height
,
and
she
carry
her
height
well
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
of
nobility
in
her
gait
,
and
she
seem
thus
to
be
tall
than
her
inch
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
be
in
truth
red
,
 
of
a
deep
thorough
redness
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
's
hair
be
the
same
;
and
so
have
be
that
of
her
father
,
before
it
have
become
sandy
with
age
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
's
have
be
of
a
soft
auburn
hue
,
and
her
have
be
say
to
be
the
pretty
head
of
hair
in
Europe
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
but
in
these
day
we
have
get
to
like
red
hair
,
and
Lady
Laura
's
be
not
suppose
to
stand
in
the
way
of
her
be
consider
a
beauty
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
very
fair
,
though
it
lack
that
softness
which
we
all
love
in
woman
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
,
which
be
large
and
bright
,
and
very
clear
,
never
seem
to
quail
,
never
rise
and
sink
or
show
themselves
to
be
afraid
of
their
own
power
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Lady
Laura
Standish
have
nothing
of
fear
about
her
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
be
perfectly
cut
,
but
be
rather
large
,
have
the
slight
possible
tendency
to
be
aquiline
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
also
be
large
,
but
be
full
of
expression
,
and
her
tooth
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
be
very
bright
,
but
in
spite
of
its
brightness
she
never
blush
.
<EOS>
the
shade
of
her
complexion
be
set
and
steady
.
<EOS>
those
who
know
her
say
that
her
heart
be
so
fully
under
command
that
nothing
could
stir
her
blood
to
any
sudden
motion
.
<EOS>
as
to
that
accusation
of
straggle
which
have
be
make
against
her
,
it
have
spring
from
ill
-
natured
observation
of
her
mode
of
sit
.
<EOS>
She
never
straggle
when
she
stand
or
walk
;
but
she
would
lean
forward
when
sit
,
as
a
man
do
,
and
would
use
her
arm
in
talk
,
and
would
put
her
hand
over
her
face
,
and
pass
her
finger
through
her
hair
,
 
after
the
fashion
of
man
rather
than
of
woman
;
 
and
she
seem
to
despise
that
soft
quiescence
of
her
sex
in
which
be
generally
find
so
many
charm
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
and
foot
be
large
,
 
as
be
her
whole
frame
.
<EOS>
such
be
Lady
Laura
Standish
;
and
Phineas
Finn
have
be
untrue
to
himself
and
to
his
own
appreciation
of
the
lady
when
he
have
describe
her
in
disparage
term
to
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
he
have
speak
of
Lady
Laura
in
disparage
term
,
he
have
so
speak
of
her
as
to
make
Miss
Flood
Jones
quite
understand
that
he
think
a
great
deal
about
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
early
on
the
Sunday
,
he
make
his
way
to
Portman
Square
in
order
that
he
may
learn
whether
there
may
be
any
sympathy
for
him
there
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
have
find
none
.
<EOS>
everything
have
be
terribly
dry
and
hard
,
and
he
have
gather
as
yet
none
of
the
fruit
which
he
have
expect
that
his
good
fortune
would
bear
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
have
not
as
yet
go
among
any
friend
,
except
those
of
his
club
,
and
man
who
be
in
the
House
along
with
him
;
 
and
at
the
club
it
may
be
that
there
be
some
who
envy
him
his
good
fortune
,
and
other
who
think
nothing
of
it
because
it
have
be
theirs
for
year
.
<EOS>
now
he
would
try
a
friend
who
,
he
hope
,
could
sympathise
;
and
therefore
he
call
in
Portman
Square
at
about
half
-
past
two
on
the
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
yes
,
 
Lady
Laura
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
the
hall
-
porter
admit
as
much
,
but
evidently
seem
to
think
that
he
have
be
disturb
from
his
dinner
before
his
time
.
<EOS>
Phineas
do
not
care
a
straw
for
the
hall
-
porter
.
<EOS>
if
Lady
Laura
be
not
kind
to
him
,
he
would
never
trouble
that
hall
-
porter
again
.
<EOS>
He
be
especially
sore
at
this
moment
because
a
value
friend
,
the
barrister
with
whom
he
have
be
read
for
the
last
three
year
,
have
spend
the
good
part
of
an
hour
that
Sunday
morning
in
prove
to
him
that
he
have
as
good
as
ruin
himself
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
first
hear
it
,
of
course
I
think
you
have
inherit
a
fortune
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
inherit
nothing
,
"
Phineas
reply
;
 
"
not
a
penny
;
and
I
never
shall
.
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Low
have
open
his
eye
very
wide
,
and
shake
his
head
very
sadly
,
and
have
whistle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
you
have
come
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
meeting
Phineas
half
-
way
across
the
large
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
,
"
say
he
,
as
he
take
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
perhaps
you
would
manage
to
see
me
before
any
one
else
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
have
wish
it
;
though
I
can
hardly
tell
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
you
why
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
but
never
mind
;
 
come
and
sit
down
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
very
glad
that
you
have
be
successful
;
 
so
very
glad
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
tell
you
that
I
should
never
think
much
of
you
if
you
do
not
at
least
try
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
therefore
I
do
try
.
"
  
"
and
have
succeed
.
<EOS>
faint
heart
,
you
know
,
never
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
a
man
's
duty
to
make
his
way
into
the
House
;
 
that
is
,
if
he
ever
mean
to
be
anybody
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
not
every
man
who
can
get
there
by
the
time
that
he
be
five
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
every
friend
that
I
have
in
the
world
say
that
I
have
ruin
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
I
do
not
say
so
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
be
worth
all
the
other
put
together
.
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
comfort
to
have
some
one
to
say
a
cheery
word
to
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
nothing
but
cheery
word
here
.
<EOS>
papa
shall
say
cheery
word
to
you
that
shall
be
well
than
mine
,
because
they
shall
be
weight
with
the
wisdom
of
age
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
him
say
twenty
time
that
the
earlier
a
man
go
into
the
House
the
well
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
to
learn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
your
father
be
think
of
man
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
at
all
<EOS>
;
 
of
young
brother
,
and
barrister
,
and
of
man
who
have

can

here
on
Wednesday
?
<EOS>
there
will
be
no
party

of
course

but
papa

want
to
shake
hand
with
you
;
and
you
legislator
of
the
Lower
House
be
more
easily
reach
on
wednesday
than
on
any
other
day

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
,
"
say
Phineas
,
feeling
,
however
,
that
he
do
not
expect
much
sympathy
from
Lord
Brentford
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy

here
;
 
you
know
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
of
Loughlinter

and
we
will
ask
your
friend
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
there
will
be
nobody
else

<EOS>
as
for
catch
Barrington
Erle

that
be
out
of
the
question
at
such
a
time
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
go
back
to
my
be
ruin
 
"
say
Phineas
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
think
of
anything
so
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
suppose
that
I
be
afraid
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
say
that
there
be
bad
thing
than
ruin
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
than
the
chance
of
ruin
.
<EOS>
supposing
that
I
have
to
emigrate
and
skin
sheep
,
what
do
it
matter
?
<EOS>
I
myself
,
be
unencumbered
,
have
myself
as
my
own
property
to
do
what
I
like
with
.
<EOS>
with
Nelson
it
be
Westminster
Abbey
or
a
peerage
.
<EOS>
with
me
it
be
parliamentary
success
or
sheep
-
skin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
shall
be
no
sheep
-
skin
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
will
guarantee
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
shall
be
safe
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
that
moment
the
door
of
the
room
be
open
,
and
a
man
enter
with
quick
step
,
come
a
few
yard
in
,
and
then
retreat
,
slam
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
with
thick
short
red
hair
,
and
an
abundance
of
very
red
beard
.
<EOS>
and
his
face
be
red
,
 
and
,
as
it
seem
to
Phineas
,
his
very
eye
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
countenance
of
the
man
which
strike
him
almost
with
dread
,
 
something
approach
to
ferocity
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
a
moment
after
the
door
be
closed
,
and
then
Lady
Laura
speak
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
brother
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
you
have
ever
meet
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Low
 
<EOS>
that
terrible
apparition
of
the
red
Lord
Chiltern
have
disturb
Phineas
in
the
moment
of
his
happiness
as
he
sit
listen
to
the
kind
flattery
of
Lady
Laura
;
and
though
Lord
Chiltern
have
vanish
as
quickly
as
he
have
appear
,
there
have
come
no
return
of
his
joy
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
say
some
word
about
her
brother
,
and
Phineas
have
reply
that
he
have
never
chance
to
see
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
then
there
have
be
an
awkward
silence
,
and
almost
immediately
other
person
have
come
in
.
<EOS>
after
greet
one
or
two
old
acquaintance
,
among
whom
an
eld
sister
of
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
be
one
,
he
take
his
leave
and
escape
out
into
the
square
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Fitzgibbon
be
go
to
dine
with
us
on
Wednesday
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
say
she
will
not
answer
for
her
brother
,
but
she
will
bring
him
if
she
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
be
a
member
of
Parliament
now
too
,
they
tell
me
,
"
say
Miss
Fitzgibbon
,
hold
up
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
everybody
will
be
in
Parliament
before
long
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
know
some
man
who
be
not
,
that
I
may
think
of
change
my
condition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Phineas
care
very
little
what
Miss
Fitzgibbon
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
everybody
know
Aspasia
Fitzgibbon
,
and
all
who
know
her
be
accustomed
to
put
up
with
the
violence
of
her
joke
and
the
bitterness
of
her
remark
.
<EOS>
She
be
an
old
maid
,
over
forty
,
very
plain
,
who
,
have
reconcile
herself
to
the
fact
that
she
be
an
old
maid
,
choose
to
take
advantage
of
such
poor
privilege
as
the
position
give
her
.
<EOS>
within
the
last
few
year
a
considerable
fortune
have
fall
into
her
hand
,
some
twenty
-
five
thousand
pound
,
which
have
come
to
her
unexpectedly
,
 
a
wonderful
windfall
.
<EOS>
and
now
she
be
the
only
one
of
her
family
who
have
money
at
command
.
<EOS>
She
live
in
a
small
house
by
herself
,
in
one
of
the
small
street
of
May
Fair
,
and
walk
about
sturdily
by
herself
,
and
speak
her
mind
about
everything
.
<EOS>
She
be
greatly
devoted
to
her
brother
Laurence
,
 
so
devoted
that
there
be
nothing
she
would
not
do
for
him
,
short
of
lend
him
money
.
  
<EOS>
but
Phineas
when
he
find
himself
out
in
the
square
thought
nothing
of
Aspasia
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
to
Lady
Laura
Standish
for
sympathy
,
and
she
have
give
it
to
him
in
full
measure
.
<EOS>
She
understand
him
and
his
aspiration
if
no
one
else
do
so
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
She
rejoice
in
his
triumph
,
and
be
not
too
hard
to
tell
him
that
she
look
forward
to
his
success
.
<EOS>
and
in
what
delightful
language
she
have
do
so
!
"
<EOS>
faint
heart
never
win
fair
lady
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
thus
,
or
almost
thus
,
that
she
have
encourage
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
well
that
she
have
in
truth
mean
nothing
more
than
her
word
have
seem
to
signify
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
for
a
moment
attribute
to
her
aught
else
.
<EOS>
but
may
not
he
get
another
lesson
from
them
?
<EOS>
He
have
often
tell
himself
that
he
be
not
in
love
with
Laura
Standish
;
 
but
why
should
he
not
how
tell
himself
that
he
be
in
love
with
her
?
<EOS>
of
course
there
would
be
difficulty
.
<EOS>
but
be
it
not
the
business
of
his
life
to
overcome
difficulty
?
<EOS>
have
he
not
already
overcome
one
difficulty
almost
as
great
;
and
why
should
he
be
afraid
of
this
other
?
<EOS>
faint
heart
never
win
fair
lady
!
<EOS>
and
this
fair
lady
,
 
for
at
this
moment
he
be
ready
to
swear
that
she
be
very
fair
,
 
be
already
half
win
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
take
him
by
the
hand
so
warmly
,
and
look
into
his
face
so
keenly
,
have
she
not
feel
for
him
something
strong
than
common
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
turn
down
Baker
Street
from
the
square
,
and
be
now
walk
towards
the
Regent
's
Park
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
and
see
the
beast
in
the
Zoological
Gardens
,
and
make
up
his
mind
as
to
his
future
mode
of
life
in
that
delightful
Sunday
solitude
.
<EOS>
there
be
very
much
as
to
which
it
be
necessary
that
he
should
make
up
his
mind
.
<EOS>
if
he
resolve
that
he
would
ask
Lady
Laura
Standish
to
be
his
wife
,
when
should
he
ask
her
,
and
in
what
manner
may
he
propose
to
her
that
they
should
live
?
<EOS>
It
would
hardly
suit
him
to
postpone
his
courtship
indefinitely
,
know
,
as
he
do
know
,
that
he
would
be
one
among
many
suitor
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
expect
her
to
wait
for
him
if
he
do
not
declare
himself
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
could
hardly
ask
her
to
come
and
share
with
him
the
allowance
make
to
him
by
his
father
!
<EOS>
whether
she
have
much
fortune
of
her
own
,
or
little
,
or
none
at
all
,
he
do
not
in
the
least
know
.
<EOS>
He
do
know
that
the
Earl
have
be
distress
by
his
son
's
extravagance
,
and
that
there
have
be
some
money
difficulty
arise
from
this
source
.
  
<EOS>
but
his
great
desire
would
be
to
support
his
own
wife
by
his
own
labour
.
<EOS>
at
present
he
be
hardly
in
a
fair
way
to
do
that
,
unless
he
could
get
pay
for
his
parliamentary
work
.
<EOS>
those
fortunate
gentleman
who
form
"
The
Government
"
be
so
pay
.
<EOS>
yes
;
 
there
be
the
Treasury
Bench
open
to
him
,
and
he
must
resolve
that
he
would
seat
himself
there
.
<EOS>
He
would
make
Lady
Laura
understand
this
,
and
then
he
would
ask
his
question
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
at
present
his
political
opponent
have
possession
of
the
Treasury
Bench
;
 
but
all
government
be
mortal
,
and
conservative
government
in
this
country
be
especially
prone
to
die
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
could
not
hold
even
a
Treasury
lordship
with
a
poor
thousand
a
year
for
his
salary
without
have
to
face
the
elector
of
Loughshane
again
before
he
enter
upon
the
enjoyment
of
his
place
;
 
but
if
he
could
only
do
something
to
give
a
grace
to
his
name
,
to
show
that
he
be
a
rise
man
,
the
elector
of
Loughshane
,
who
have
once
be
so
easy
with
him
,
would
surely
not
be
cruel
to
him
when
he
show
himself
a
second
time
among
them
.
<EOS>
Lord
Tulla
be
his
friend
,
and
he
have
those
point
of
law
in
his
favour
which
possession
bestow
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
remember
that
Lady
Laura
be
relate
to
almost
everybody
who
be
anybody
among
the
high
Whigs
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
he
know
,
second
cousin
to
Mr.
Mildmay
,
who
for
year
have
be
the
leader
of
the
Whigs
,
and
be
third
cousin
to
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
the
late
President
of
the
Council
,
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
and
Lord
Brentford
have
marry
sister
,
and
the
St.
Bungay
people
,
and
the
mildmay
people
,
and
the
Brentford
people
have
all
some
sort
of
connection
with
the
Palliser
people
,
of
whom
the
heir
and
come
chief
,
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
would
certainly
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
in
the
next
Government
.
<EOS>
simply
as
an
introduction
into
official
life
nothing
could
be
more
conducive
to
chance
of
success
than
a
matrimonial
alliance
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
would
have
think
of
such
a
thing
on
that
account
!
<EOS>
no
;
 
he
think
of
it
because
he
love
her
;
honestly
because
he
love
her
.
<EOS>
He
swear
to
that
half
a
dozen
time
,
for
his
own
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
but
,
love
her
as
he
do
,
and
resolve
that
in
spite
of
all
difficulty
she
should
become
his
wife
,
there
could
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
,
 
on
her
account
as
well
as
on
his
own
,
 
take
advantage
of
any
circumstance
that
there
may
be
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
wander
among
the
unsavoury
beast
,
elbow
on
every
side
by
the
Sunday
visitor
to
the
garden
,
he
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
first
let
Lady
Laura
understand
what
be
his
intention
with
regard
to
his
future
career
,
and
then
he
would
ask
her
to
join
her
lot
to
his
.
<EOS>
at
every
turn
the
chance
would
of
course
be
very
much
against
him
;
 
ten
to
one
against
him
,
perhaps
,
on
every
point
;
but
it
be
his
lot
in
life
to
have
to
face
such
odd
.
<EOS>
twelve
month
since
it
have
be
much
more
than
ten
to
one
against
his
get
into
Parliament
;
and
yet
he
be
there
.
<EOS>
He
expect
to
be
blow
into
fragment
,
 
to
sheep
-
skin
in
Australia
,
or
pack
preserve
meat
on
the
plain
of
Paraguay
;
but
when
the
blowing
into
atom
should
come
,
he
be
resolve
that
courage
to
bear
the
ruin
should
not
be
want
.
<EOS>
then
he
quote
a
line
or
two
of
a
latin
poet
,
and
feel
himself
to
be
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
,
here
you
be
again
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
say
a
voice
in
his
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Miss
Fitzgibbon
;
here
I
be
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
you
member
of
Parliament
have
something
else
to
do
besides
look
at
wild
beast
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
always
spend
Sunday
in
arrange
how
you
may
most
effectually
badger
each
other
on
Monday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
get
through
all
that
early
this
morning
,
Miss
Fitzgibbon
,
while
you
be
say
your
prayer

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
here
be
Mr.
Kennedy
too
;
 
you
know
him
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
He
also
be
a
member
;
but
then
he
can
afford
to
be
idle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
it
so
happen
that
Phineas
do
not
know
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
consequently
there
be
some
slight
form
of
introduction
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
be
to
meet
you
at
dinner
on
Wednesday
,
"
 
say
Phineas
,
 
"
at
Lord
Brentford
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
me
too
,
"
say
Miss
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
which
will
be
the
great
possible
addition
to
our
pleasure
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
who
seem
to
be
afflict
with
some
difficulty
in
speak
,
and
whose
bow
to
our
hero
have
hardly
do
more
than
produce
the
slight
possible
motion
to
the
top
of
his
hat
,
hereupon
mutter
something
which
be
take
to
mean
an
assent
to
the
proposition
as
to
Wednesday
's
dinner
.
<EOS>
then
he
stand
perfectly
still
,
with
his
two
hand
fix
on
the
top
of
his
umbrella
,
and
gaze
at
the
great
monkey
'
cage
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
clear
that
he
be
not
look
at
any
special
monkey
,
for
his
eye
never
wander
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
see
such
a
contrast
in
your
life
?
"
say
Miss
Fitzgibbon
to
Phineas
,
 
hardly
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
between
what
?
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
between
Mr.
Kennedy
and
a
monkey
.
<EOS>
the
monkey
have
so
much
to
say
for
himself
,
and
be
so
delightfully
wicked
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
that
Mr.
Kennedy
ever
do
anything
wrong
in
his
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
be
a
man
who
have
very
little
temptation
to
do
anything
wrong
.
<EOS>
He
be
possess
of
over
a
million
and
a
half
of
money
,
which
he
be
mistaken
enough
to
suppose
he
have
make
himself
;
whereas
it
may
be
doubt
whether
he
have
ever
earn
a
penny
.
<EOS>
His
father
and
his
uncle
have
create
a
business
in
Glasgow
,
and
that
business
now
belong
to
him

<EOS>
but
his

up
his
mind
that
Mr.

be
insolent
with
the
insolence
of
rich

that
he
would
hate
Mr.

<EOS>
He
be
engage

dine
on
this
Sunday
with
Mr.
Low

the
barrister

with
whom
he

read
for
the
last
three
year

<EOS>
Mr.

have
take
a
strong
liking
to
Phineas

as
have
also
Mrs.

,
and
the
tutor
have
more
than
once
tell
his
pupil
that
success
in
his
profession
be
certainly
open
to
him
if
he
would
only
stick
to
his
work
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
be
himself
an
ambitious
man
,
look
forward
to
enter
Parliament
at
some
future
time
,
when
the
exigency
of
his
life
of
labour
may
enable
him
to
do
so
;
but
he
be
prudent
,
give
to
close
calculation
,
and
resolve
to
make
the
ground
sure
beneath
his
foot
in
every
step
that
he
take
forward
.
<EOS>
when
he
first
hear
that
Finn
intend
to
stand
for
Loughshane
he
be
stricken
with
dismay
,
and
strongly
dissuade
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
elector
may
probably
reject
him
.
<EOS>
that
be
his
only
chance
now
,
"
Mr.
Low
have
say
to
his
wife
,
when
he
find
that
Phineas
be
,
as
he
think
,
foolhardy
.
<EOS>
but
the
elector
of
Loughshane
have
not
reject
Mr.
Low
's
pupil
,
and
Mr.
Low
be
now
call
upon
to
advise
what
Phineas
should
do
in
his
present
circumstance
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
work
of
a
Chancery
barrister
be
do
by
a
member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
most
successful
barrister
be
member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
but
Phineas
Finn
be
begin
at
the
wrong
end
,
and
Mr.
Low
know
that
no
good
would
come
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
think
of
your
being

Mr.

"
It
be
wonderful

<EOS>
"
It
take
us
so
much
by
surprise
!
"
say
Mrs.

<EOS>
"
as
a
rule
one
never
hear
of
a
barrister
go
into
Parliament
till
after
he
be
forty

<EOS>
"
and
I
be
only
twenty

five

<EOS>
I
do

indeed
,
Mrs.

<EOS>
"
  
"
no
;
 
you
have
not
disgrace
yourself
,
Mr.
Finn

<EOS>
the
only
question
be
,
whether
it
be
prudent
.
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
all
turn
out
for
the
good
,
most
heartily
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Low
be
a
very
matter
-
of
-
fact
lady
,
four
or
five
year
old
than
her
husband
,
who
have
have
a
little
money
of
her
own
,
and
be
possess
of
every
virtue
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
she
do
not
quite
like
the
idea
of
her
husband
's
pupil
have
get
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
if
her
husband
and
Phineas
Finn
be
dine
anywhere
together
,
Phineas
,
who
have
come
to
them
quite
a
boy
,
would
walk
out
of
the
room
before
her
husband
.
<EOS>
this
could
hardly
be
right
!
<EOS>
nevertheless
she
help
Phineas
to
the
nice
bit
of
fish
she
could
find
,
and
have
he
be
ill
,
would
have
nurse
him
with
the
great
care
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
when
Mrs.
Low
have
go
up
-
stair
,
there
come
the
great
discussion
between
the
tutor
and
the
pupil
,
for
the
sake
of
which
this
little
dinner
have
be
give
.
<EOS>
when
Phineas
have
last
be
with
Mr.
Low
,
 
on
the
occasion
of
his
show
himself
at
his
tutor
's
chamber
after
his
return
from
Ireland
,
 
he
have
not
make
up
his
mind
so
thoroughly
on
certain
point
as
he
have
do
since
he
have
see
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
the
discussion
could
hardly
be
of
any
avail
now
,
 
but
it
could
not
be
avoid
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Phineas
,
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
?
"
say
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
everybody
who
know
our
hero
,
or
nearly
everybody
,
call
him
by
his
christian
name
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
who
seem
to
be
so
treat
by
general
consent
in
all
society
.
<EOS>
even
Mrs.
Low
,
who
be
very
prosaic
,
and
unlikely
to
be
familiar
in
her
mode
of
address
,
have
fall
into
the
way
of
do
it
before
the
election
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
drop
it
,
when
the
Phineas
whom
she
use
to
know
become
a
member
of
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
question
;
 
be
not
it
?
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
of

you
will
stick

your
work

Mr.

there
I

you
may

low

how
can
I
be
wrong

<EOS>
do
a
period

idleness
ever

be
it
not
acknowledge
by
all

know

more

why
simply
this

here
I
be
in

as

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
the
fact

if
it
be
a
misfortune

we
must
make
the
good
of
it

you
would
not

me
to
apply
for
the
Chiltern
Hundreds
at

I
would

morrow

you
pain

if
you
come
to
me

I
can
only
tell
you
what
I
think

My
advice
to
you
be
to
give
it
up
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
man
would
laugh
at
you
for
a
few
week
,
but
that
be
well
than
be
ruin
for
life

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
do
that
,
"
say
Phineas

sadly

<EOS>
"
very
well

then
let
us
go
on
,
"
say
Mr.
Low

<EOS>
"
if
you
will
not

up

the
next
good

will
be

take
care

interfere
as
little

possible

your
work

<EOS>
I
suppose
you
must
sit
upon
some
Committees

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
idea
be
this
,
 
that
I
will
give
up
one
year
to
learn
the
practice
of
the
House

do
nothing

nothing

that

the

for
learn
it
in

that
be
out
of

I
be
convinced
that
if
a
man
intend

be
a
useful

he
should
make
a
study
of
it

do
you
mean

live
in

<EOS>
Mr.

who
be
an
energetic
man

have
assume
almost
an
angry
tone
of
voice
.
<EOS>
phineas
for
awhile
sit
silent
;
 
not
that
he
feel
himself
to
be
without
word
for
a
reply
,
but
that
he
be
think
in
what
few
word
he
may
best
convey
his
idea
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
very
modest
allowance
from
your

you
have
never

yourself
free

Mr.

He
have
increase
it

will
turn
out
to

parliamentary

idleness

my

very
good

very
bad

They

generally
good
aspiration

as
we
may
say
,
strong
body
with
weak
leg

then

because
their

weak

they
drift
into
idleness

all
this
drifting
they
be
wretched

they
have
thoroughly
drift

the
agony

in
nine
case
out

it

some
one
small
unfortunate
event
that
put
a

astray

you

nothing

what
be
you

You
will
be
the
creature
of
some

not
his
colleague

You
be
to
make
your
way
up
the
ladder
by
pretend
to
agree
whenever
agreement

from
you

by

some

hundred

just
so
long
as
a
party
may
remain
in
power

you
can
retain
a

<EOS>
It

at
the
good
slavery
and
degradation

even
if
you

lucky
enough
to
achieve
the
slavery

You
yourself

Mr.
Low
be
not
quick
to
answer
,

he
do
answer
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
though
I
have
never
tell
you
so

<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
hardly
true
to
say
that
I
hope
it

<EOS>
I
have
my
dream
,
and
sometimes
dare
to
tell
myself
that
they
may
possibly
become
wake
fact

if
ever
I
sit
on
a
Treasury
bench
I
shall
sit
there

special
invitation

be
summon
to
take
a
high
place

my
professional
success

It
be

a
dream

I
would
not

you
repeat

yes

I
be

I
live
upon
what
I
earn

like
a

can
already
afford
to
be
indifferent
to
work
that
I
dislike

after
all

the
other
part

it

that
of
which
I
dream

be
but
an
unnecessary
adjunct

the
gilding
on
the
gingerbread

I
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
cake
be
more
wholesome
without

"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
do
not
go
up
-
stair
into
Mrs.
Low
's
drawing
-
room
on
that
evening
,
nor
do
he
stay
very
late
with
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
enough
of
counsel
to
make
him
very
unhappy
,
 
to
shake
from
him
much
of
the
audacity
which
he
have
acquire
for
himself
during
his
morning
's
walk
,
 
and
to
make
him
almost
doubt
whether
,
after
all
,
the
Chiltern
Hundreds
would
not
be
for
him
the
safe
escape
from
his
difficulty
.
<EOS>
but
in
that
case
he
must
never
venture
to
see
Lady
Laura
Standish
again
.
   
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
's
Dinner
 
no
;
 
in
such
case
as
that
,
 
should
he
resolve
upon
take
the
advice
of
his
old
friend
Mr.
Low
,
Phineas
Finn
must
make
up
his
mind
never
to
see
Lady
Laura
Standish
again
!
<EOS>
and
he
be
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
Standish
;
 
and
,
for
aught
he
know
,
Lady
Laura
Standish
may
be
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
as
he
walk
home
from
Mr.
Low
's
house
in
Bedford
Square
,
he
be
by
no
mean
a
triumphant
man
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
much
more
say
between
him
and
Mr.
Low
than
could
be
lay
before
the
reader
in
the
last
chapter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
have
urge
him
again
and
again
,
and
have
prevail
so
far
that
Phineas
,
before
he
leave
the
house
,
have
promise
to
consider
that
suicidal
expedient
of
the
Chiltern
Hundreds
.
<EOS>
what
a
by
-
word
he
would
become
if
he
be
to
give
up
Parliament
,
have
sit
there
for
about
a
week
!
<EOS>
but
such
immediate
giving
up
be
one
of
the
necessity
of
Mr.
Low
's
programme
.
<EOS>
accord
to
Mr.
Low
's
teaching
,
a
single
year
pass
amidst
the
miasma
of
the
House
of
Commons
would
be
altogether
fatal
to
any
chance
of
professional
success
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Low
have
at
any
rate
succeed
in
make
Phineas
believe
that
he
be
right
in
this
lesson
.
<EOS>
there
be
his
profession
,
as
to
which
Mr.
Low
assure
him
that
success
be
within
his
reach
;
and
there
be
Parliament
on
the
other
side
,
<EOS>
as
to
which
he
know
that
the
chance
be
all
against
him
,
in
spite
of
his
advantage
of
a
seat
.
<EOS>
that
he
could
not
combine
the
two
,
begin
with
Parliament
,
he
do
believe
.
<EOS>
which
should
it
be
?
<EOS>
that
be
the
question
which
he
try
to
decide
as
he
walk
home
from
Bedford
Square
to
Great
Marlborough
Street
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
answer
the
question
satisfactorily
,
and
go
to
bed
an
unhappy
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
must
at
any
rate
go
to
Lord
Brentford
's
dinner
on
Wednesday
,
and
,
to
enable
him
to
join
in
the
conversation
there
,
must
attend
the
debate
on
Monday
and
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
the
reader
may
perhaps
be
best
make
to
understand
how
terrible
be
our
hero
's
state
of
doubt
by
be
tell
that
for
awhile
he
think
of
absent
himself
from
these
debate
,
as
be
likely
to
weaken
his
purpose
of
withdraw
altogether
from
the
House
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
often
that
so
strong
a
fury
rage
between
party
and
party
at
the
commencement
of
the
session
that
a
division
be
take
upon
the
Address
.
<EOS>
It
be
customary
for
the
leader
of
the
opposition
on
such
occasion
to
express
his
opinion
in
the
most
courteous
language
,
that
his
right
honourable
friend
,
sit
opposite
to
him
on
the
Treasury
bench
,
have
be
,
be
,
and
will
be
wrong
in
everything
that
he
think
,
say
,
or
do
in
public
life
;
but
that
,
as
anything
like
factious
opposition
be
never
adopt
on
that
side
of
the
House
,
the
address
to
the
Queen
,
in
answer
to
that
most
fatuous
speech
which
have
be
put
into
her
Majesty
's
gracious
mouth
,
shall
be
allow
to
pass
unquestione
.
<EOS>
then
the
leader
of
the
House
thank
his
adversary
for
his
consideration
<EOS>
,
explain
to
all
man
how
happy
the
country
ought
to
be
that
the
Government
have
not
fall
into
the
disgracefully
incapable
hand
of
his
right
honourable
friend
opposite
;
and
after
that
the
Address
be
carry
amidst
universal
serenity
.
<EOS>
but
such
be
not
the
order
of
the
day
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
the
veteran
leader
of
the
liberal
side
of
the
House
,
have
move
an
amendment
to
the
Address
,
and
have
urge
upon
the
House
,
in
very
strong
language
,
the
expediency
of
showing
,
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
session
,
that
the
country
have
return
to
Parliament
a
strong
majority
determine
not
to
put
up
with
conservative
inactivity
.
<EOS>
"
I
conceive
it
to
be
my
duty
,
"
Mr.
Mildmay
have
say
,
"
at
once
to
assume
that
the
country
be
unwilling
that
the
right
honourable
gentleman
opposite
should
keep
their
seat
on
the
bench
upon
which
they
sit
,
and
in
the
performance
of
that
duty
I
be
call
upon
to
divide
the
House
upon
the
address
to
her
Majesty
.
"
<EOS>
and
if
Mr.
Mildmay
use
strong
language
,
the
reader
may
be
sure
that
Mr.
Mildmay
's
follower
use
language
much
strong
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Daubeny
,
who
be
the
present
leader
of
the
House
,
and
representative
there
of
the
Ministry
,
 
Lord
de
Terrier
,
the
Premier
,
sit
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
 
be
not
the
man
to
allow
these
amenity
to
pass
by
without
adequate
reply
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
friend
be
very
strong
in
sarcasm
,
if
they
fail
in
argument
,
and
lack
nothing
for
word
,
though
it
may
perhaps
be
prove
that
they
be
short
in
number
.
<EOS>
It
be
consider
that
the
speech
in
which
Mr.
Daubeny
review
the
long
political
life
of
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
show
that
Mr.
Mildmay
have
be
at
one
time
a
bugbear
,
and
then
a
nightmare
,
and
latterly
simply
a
fungus
,
be
one
of
the
severe
attack
,
if
not
the
most
severe
,
that
have
be
hear
in
that
House
since
the
Reform
Bill
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
the
while
,
be
sit
with
his
hat
low
down
over
his
eye
,
and
many
man
say
that
he
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
but
this
speech
be
not
make
till
after
that
dinner
at
Lord
Brentford
's
,
of
which
a
short
account
must
be
give
.
  
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
for
the
overwhelming
interest
of
the
doing
in
Parliament
at
the
commencement
of
the
session
,
Phineas
may
have
perhaps
abstain
from
attend
,
in
spite
of
the
charm
of
novelty
.
<EOS>
for
,
in
truth
,
Mr.
Low
's
word
have
move
him
much
.
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
to
be
his
fate
to
be
a
member
of
Parliament
only
for
ten
day
,
surely
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
take
advantage
of
the
time
to
hear
such
a
debate
as
this
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
thing
to
talk
of
to
his
child
in
twenty
year
'
time
,
or
to
his
grandchild
in
fifty
;
 
and
it
would
be
essentially
necessary
that
he
should
be
able
to
talk
of
it
to
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
do
,
therefore
,
sit
in
the
House
till
one
on
the
Monday
night
,
and
till
two
on
the
Tuesday
night
,
and
hear
the
debate
adjourn
till
the
Thursday
.
<EOS>
on
the
Thursday
Mr.
Daubeny
be
to
make
his
great
speech
,
and
then
the
division
would
come
.
  
<EOS>
when
Phineas
enter
Lady
Laura
's
drawing
-
room
on
the
Wednesday
before
dinner
,
he
find
the
other
guest
all
assemble
.
<EOS>
why
man
should
have
be
earlier
in
keep
their
dinner
engagement
on
that
day
than
on
any
other
he
do
not
understand
;
but
it
be
the
fact
,
probably
,
that
the
great
anxiety
of
the
time
make
those
who
be
at
all
concern
in
the
matter
very
keen
to
hear
and
to
be
hear
.
<EOS>
during
these
day
everybody
be
in
a
hurry
,
 
everybody
be
eager
;
and
there
be
a
common
feeling
that
not
a
minute
be
to
be
lose
.
<EOS>
there
be
three
lady
in
the
room
,
 
Lady
Laura
,
Miss
Fitzgibbon
,
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
the
wife
of
a
gentleman
who
have
be
a
junior
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
in
the
late
Government
,
and
who
live
in
the
expectation
of
filling
,
perhaps
,
some
high
office
in
the
Government
which
,
as
he
hope
,
be
soon
to
be
call
into
existence
.
<EOS>
there
be
five
gentleman
besides
Phineas
Finn
himself
,
 
Mr.
Bonteen
,
Mr.
Kennedy
,
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
,
Barrington
Erle

who
have
be
catch
in
spite
of
all
that
Lady
Laura
have
say
as
to
the
difficulty
of
such
an
operation
,
and
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
quick
to
observe
that
every
male
guest
be
in
Parliament
,
and
to
tell
himself
that
he
would
not
have
be
there
unless
he
also
have
have
a
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
all
here
now
,
"
say
the
Earl
,
ring
the
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
not
keep
you

,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
we
be
in
such
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
and
how
many
do
you
say
it
will
be
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
seventeen
,
I
suppose
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
more
likely
twenty
-
two
,
"
say
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
Colcleugh
so
ill
they
can
not
possibly
bring
him
up
,
and
young
Rochester
be
at
Vienna

Gunning
be
sulk
about
something

and
Moody
have
lose
his
eld
son

by
George

<EOS>
they
press
him
to
come
up
,
although
Frank
Moody
will
not
be
bury
till
Friday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
it
,
"
say
Lord
Brentford
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ask
some
of
the
Carlton
fellow
,
and
they
will
own
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
would
lose
every
relation
I
have
in
the
world
,
"
say
Fitzgibbon
,
"
I
would
vote
on
such
a
question
as
this

<EOS>
stay
away
will
not
bring
poor
Frank
Moody
back
to
life

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
a
decency
in
these
matter
,
be
there
not
,
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
?
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
have
throw
all
that
kind
of
thing
overboard
long
ago
,
"
say
Miss
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
well
that
they
should
have
no
veil
,
than
squabble
about
the
thickness
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
dinner
be
announce

<EOS>
the
Earl
walk
off
with
Miss
Fitzgibbon
,
Barrington
Erle
take
Mrs.
Bonteen

and
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
take
Lady

<EOS>
"
I
will
bet
four
pound
to
two
<EOS>
it
be
over
nineteen
,
"
say
Mr.
Bonteen
,
as
he
pass
through
the
drawing
-
room
door
.
<EOS>
the
remark
seem
to
have
be
address
to
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
Phineas
therefore
make
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
it
will
,
"
say
Kennedy
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
never
bet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
vote
 
sometimes
,
I
hope
,
"
say
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
sometimes
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
be
the
most
odious
man
that
ever
I
set
my
eye
on
,
"
say
Phineas
to
himself
as
he
follow
Mr.
Kennedy
into
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
have
observe
that
Mr.
Kennedy
have
be
stand
very
near
to
Lady
Laura
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
that
Lady
Laura
have
say
a
few
word
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
more
determined
than
ever
that
he
would
hate
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
would
probably
have
be
moody
and
unhappy
throughout
the
whole
dinner
have
not
Lady
Laura
call
him
to
a
chair
at
her
left
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
generous
of
her
;
and
the
more
so
,
as
Mr.
Kennedy
have
,
in
a
half
-
hesitating
manner
,
prepare
to
seat
himself
in
that
very
place
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
Phineas
and
Mr.
Kennedy
be
neighbour
,
but
Phineas
have
the
place
of

I

<EOS>
certainly
not

you

You
be

I

whether

I
wish
I
may
have
the
chance

"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
can
have
the
chance
if
you
try
for
it

<EOS>
begin
so
early
,
and
be
on
the
right
side
,
 
and
,
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
,
among
the
right
set
,
 
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
you
may
take
office
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
sure
that
you
will
be
tractable

<EOS>
You
can
not
begin
,
you
know
,
by
be
Prime
Minister

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
enough
to
realise
that
already
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
only
keep
that
little
fact
steadily
before
your
eye

there
be
nothing
you
may
not

official
life

<EOS>
but
Pitt

Prime
Minister
at
four
-

twenty

that
precedent
have
ruin
half
our
young

<EOS>

It

not
affect
me

Lady
Laura

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
there
be
no
great
difficulty
in
government
.
<EOS>
a
man
must
learn
to
have
word
at
command
when
he
be
on
his
leg
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
in
the
same
way
as
he
would
if
he
be
talk
to
his
own
servant

<EOS>
He
must
keep
his
temper
;
and
he
must
be
very
patient
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
have
see
Cabinet
Ministers
,
they
be
not
more
clever
than
other
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
be
generally
one
or
two
man
of
ability
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
of
fair
ability
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
be
a
good
speciman
.
<EOS>
there
be
not

and
never
be
,
anything
brilliant
in
him

<EOS>
He
be
not
eloquent
,
nor
,
as
far
as
I
be
aware
,
do
he
ever
create
anything
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
always
be
a
steady

honest
,
persevere
man
,
and
circumstance
have
make
politic
come
easy
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

think
of
the
momentous
question

he
have
be
call
upon

decide

Phineas

<EOS>
"
every
question
so
handle
by
him
have
be
decide
rightly
accord
to
his

wrongly
accord
to
the
party
opposite

<EOS>
a
political
leader
be
so
sure
of
support
<EOS>

so
sure
of
attack
,
that
it
be
hardly
necessary
for
him
to
be
even
anxious
to
be
right
.
<EOS>
for
the
country
's

,
he
should
have
official
under
him

know
the
routine
of
business

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
very
badly
then
of
politic
as
a
profession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
think
of
them
very
highly
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
well
to
deal
with
the
repeal
of
law
than
the
defending
of

<EOS>
but
all
this
be
papa
's
wisdom
,
not
mine

<EOS>
Papa
have
never

therefore
of

he
be
a
little
caustic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
be
quite
right

Barrington
Erle
stoutly

He
speak
so
stoutly

I

just
so

<EOS>
It
be
,
as
you
say
,
his
only
chance

it
be
his
right
.
<EOS>
His
very
possession
of
power
will
give
him
near
a
score
of
vote
,
and
if
he
think
that
he
have
a
chance
,
let
him
try
it
.
<EOS>
We
maintain
that
he
have
no
chance

that
he
must
have
know
that

none

that
if

he
certainly

We
have
fail
last
summer

if

along
he
be
welcome

he
could
not
get
along

<EOS>
"
I
must
say
I
think
he
be
right
to
dissolve

say
Lady
Laura

we
be
right
to
force
the

lose
nine

yes

Mr.

make
but
one
remark
,

then
he
observe
that
as
far
as
he
could
see
a
majority
of
nineteen
would
be
as
serviceable
as
a
majority
of
twenty

<EOS>
this
he
say
in
a
very
mild
voice

in
a
tone
that
be
intend
to
be
expressive
of
doubt

in
spite
of
his
humility
Barrington

fly
at
him
almost
savagely

as
though
a
liberal
member
of

be
disgrace
by

mean
a
spirit

<EOS>
Phineas
go
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
for
a
few
minute
after
dinner
,
and
be
eagerly
desirous
of
say
a
few
more
word

he
know
not

word

to
Lady

<EOS>
Mr.

leave

room
first
,

Phineas
again
find
Mr.

stand
close
to
Lady
Laura
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
there
be
anything
in
it
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
be
an
unmarried
man
,
with
an
immense
fortune
,
a
magnificent
place
,
a
seat
in
Parliament
,
and
be
not
perhaps
above
forty
year
of
age
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
ask
Lady
Laura
to
be
his
wife
,
 
except
,
indeed
,
that
he
do
not
seem
to
have
sufficient
word
at
command
to
ask
anybody
for
anything
.
<EOS>
but
could
it
be
that
such
a
woman
as
Lady
Laura
could
accept
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Kennedy
because
of
his
wealth
,
and
because
of
his
fine
place
,
 
a
man
who
have
not
a
word
to
throw
to
a
dog
,
who
do
not
seem
to
be
possess
of
an
idea
,
who
hardly
look
like
a
gentleman
;
 
so
Phineas
tell
himself
.
<EOS>
but
in
truth
Mr.
Kennedy
,
though
he
be
a
plain
,
unattractive
man
,
with
nothing
in
his
personal
appearance
to
call
for
remark
,
be
not
unlike
a
gentleman
in
his
usual
demeanour
.
<EOS>
phineas
himself
,
it
may
be
here
say
,
be
six
foot
high
,
and
very
handsome
,
with
bright
blue
eye
,
and
brown
wavy
hair
,
and
light
silken
beard
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Low
have
tell
her
husband
more
than
once
that
he
be
much
too
handsome
to
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
,
however
,
have
reply
that
young
Finn
have
never
show
himself
to
be
conscious
of
his
own
personal
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
will
learn
it
soon
enough
,
"
say
Mrs.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
some
woman
will
tell
him
,
and
then
he
will
be
spoilt
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
Phineas
depend
much
as
yet
on
his
own
good
look
,
but
he
feel
that
Mr.
Kennedy
ought
to
be
despise
by
such
a
one
as
Lady
Laura
Standish
,
because
his
look
be
not
good
.
<EOS>
and
she
must
despise
him
!
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
that
a
woman
so
full
of
life
should
be
willing
to
put
up
with
a
man
who
absolutely
seem
to
have
no
life
within
him
.
<EOS>
and
yet
why
be
he
there
,
and
why
be
he
allow
to
hang
about
just
over
her
shoulder
?
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
begin
to
feel
himself
to
be
an
injure
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
Lady
Laura
have
the
power
of
dispel
instantly
this
sense
of
injury

<EOS>
She
have
do
it
effectually
in
the
dining
-
room
by
call
him
to
the
seat
by
her
side
,
to
the
express
exclusion
of
the
millionaire
,
and
she
do
it
again
now
by
walk
away
from
Mr.
Kennedy
to
the
spot
on
which
Phineas
have
place
himself
somewhat
sulkily
.

expect
to
hear
much
of
an
opinion
from
Mr.
Kennedy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
quite
know
Mr.
Kennedy
yet
.
<EOS>
and
you
must
remember
that
he
will
say
more
to
me
than
he
will
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
quick
,
you
know
,
as
you
be
,
and
he
have
no
enthusiasm
on
any
subject
;
 
but
he
have
opinion
,
and
sound
opinion
too
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
feel
that
Lady
Laura
be
in
a
slight
degree
scold
him
for
the
disrespectful
manner
in
which
he
have
speak
of
Mr.
Kennedy
;
and
he
feel
also
that
he
have
commit
himself
,
 
that
he
have
show
himself
to
be
sore
,
and
that
she
have
see
and
understand
his
soreness
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
I
do
not
know
him
,
"
say
he
,
try
to
correct
his
blunder
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
not
as
yet
.
<EOS>
but
I
hope
that
you
may
some
day
,
as
he
be
one
of
those
man
who
be
both
useful
and
estimable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
I
can
use
him
,
"
say
Phineas
;
"
but
if
you
wish
it
,
I
will
endeavour
to
esteem
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
do
both
;
 
but
that
will
all
come
in
due
time
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
probable
that
in
the
early
autumn
there
will
be
a
great
gathering
of
the
real
Whig
Liberals
at
Loughlinter
;
 
of
those
,
I
mean
,
who
have
their
heart
in
it
,
and
be
at
the
same
time
gentleman
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
I
should
be
sorry
that
you
should
not
be
there
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
mention
it
,
but
Mr.
Kennedy
have
just
say
a
word
about
it
to
papa
,
and
a
word
from
him
always
mean
so
much
!
<EOS>
well
;
 
good
-
night
;
and
mind
you
come
up
on
Friday
.
<EOS>
You
be
go
to
the
club
,
now
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
envy
you
men
your
club
more
than
I
do
the
House
;
 
though
I
feel
that
a
woman
's
life
be
only
half
a
life
,
as
she
can
not
have
a
seat
in
Parliament
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
Phineas
go
away
,
and
walk
down
to
Pall
Mall
with
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
prefer
to
take
his
walk
alone
,
but
he
could
not
get
rid
of
his
affectionate
countryman
.
<EOS>
He
want
to
think
over
what
have
take
place
during
the
evening
;
and
,
indeed
,
he
do
so
in
spite
of
his
friend
's
conversation
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
,
when
she
first
see
him
after
his
return
to
London
,
have
tell
him
how
anxious
her
father
be
to
congratulate
him
on
his
seat
,
but
the
Earl
have
not
speak
a
word
to
him
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
have
be
courteous
,
as
host
customarily
be
,
but
have
be
in
no
way
specially
kind
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
then
Mr.
Kennedy
!
<EOS>
as
to
go
to
Loughlinter
,
he
would
not
do
such
a
thing
,
 
not
though
the
success
of
the
liberal
party
be
to
depend
on
it
.
<EOS>
He
declare
to
himself
that
there
be
some
thing
which
a
man
could
not
do
.
<EOS>
but
although
he
be
not
altogether
satisfied
with
what
have
occur
in
Portman
Square
,
he
feel
as
he
walk
down
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Fitzgibbon
that
Mr.
Low
and
Mr.
Low
's
counsel
must
be
scatter
to
the
wind
.
<EOS>
He
have
throw
the
die
in
consent
to
stand
for
Loughshane

must
stand
the
hazard
of
the
cast

<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bunce
 
<EOS>
It
be
three
o'clock
on
the
Thursday
night
before
Mr.
Daubeny
's
speech
be
finish
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
there
be
any
truth
in
the
allegation
make
at
the
time
,
that
he
continue
on
his
leg
an
hour
longer
than
the
necessity
of
his
speech
require
,
in
order
that
five
or
six
<EOS>
very
ancient
Whigs
may
be
weary
out
and
shrink
to
their
bed
.
<EOS>
let
a
Whig
have
be
ever
so
ancient
and
ever
so
weary
,
he
would
not
have
be
allow
to
depart
from
Westminster
Hall
that
night
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
Powell
be
there
in
his
bath
-
chair
at
twelve
,
with
a
doctor
on
one
side
of
him
and
a
friend
on
the
other
,
in
some
purlieu
of
the
House
,
and
do
his
duty
like
a
fine
old
Briton
as
he
be
.
<EOS>
that
speech
of
Mr.
Daubeny
's
will
never
be
forget
by
any
one
who
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Its
study
bitterness
have
perhaps
never
be
equal
,
and
yet
not
a
word
be
utter
for
the
saying
of
which
he
could
be
accuse
of
go
beyond
the
limit
of
parliamentary
antagonism
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
personality
could
not
have
be
close
,
that
accusation
of
political
dishonesty
and
of
almost
bad
than
political
cowardice
and
falsehood
could
not
have
be
clear
,
that
no
word
in
the
language
could
have
attribute
mean
motive
or
more
unscrupulous
conduct
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
Mr.
Daubeny
in
all
that
he
say
be
parliamentary
,
and
show
himself
to
be
a
gladiator
thoroughly
well
train
for
the
arena
in
which
he
have
descend
to
the
combat
.
<EOS>
His
arrow
be
poison
,
and
his
lance
be
barb
,
and
his
shot
be
heated
red
,
 
because
such
thing
be
allow
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
poison
his
enemy
'
well
or
use
greek
fire
,
because
those
thing
be
not
allow
.
<EOS>
He
know
exactly
the
rule
of
the
combat
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
sit
and
hear
him
without
once
raise
his
hat
from
his
brow
,
or
speak
a
word
to
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
men
on
both
side
of
the
House
say
that
Mr.
Mildmay
suffer
terribly
;
but
as
Mr.
Mildmay
utter
no
word
of
complaint
to
any
one
,
and
be
quite
ready
to
take
Mr.
Daubeny
by
the
hand
the
next
time
they
meet
in
company
,
I
do
not
know
that
any
one
be
able
to
form
a
true
idea
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
be
an
impassive
man
who
rarely
speak
of
his
own
feeling
,
and
no
doubt
sit
with
his
hat
low
down
over
his
eye
in
order
that
no
man
may
judge
of
them
on
that
occasion
by
the
impression
on
his
feature
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
could
have
leave
off
half
an
hour
earlier
it
would
have
be
perfect
as
an
attack
,
"
say
Barrington
Erle
in
criticise
Mr.
Daubeny
's
speech
,
"
but
he
allow
himself
to
sink
into
comparative
weakness
,
and
the
glory
of
it
be
over
before
the
end
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
then
come
the
division
.
<EOS>
the
Liberals
have
333
vote
to
314
for
the
Conservatives
,
and
therefore
count
a
majority
of
19
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
so
large
a
number
of
member
have
never
before
vote
at
any
division
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
own
I
be
disappointed
,
"
say
Barrington
Erle
to
Mr.
Ratler
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
would
be
twenty
,
"
say
Mr.
Ratler
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
go
beyond
that
.
<EOS>
I
know
they
would
have
old
Moody
up
,
but
I
think
Gunning
would
have
be
too
hard
for
them
.

<EOS>
"
They
say
they
have
promise
them
both
peerage
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes

if
they
remain
in
.
<EOS>
but
they
know
they
be
go
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
must
go
,
with
such
a
majority
against
them
,
"
say
Barrington
Erle
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
they
must
,
"
say
Mr.
Ratler
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
want
nothing
better
,
but
it
be
rather
hard
upon
poor
Daubeny

I
never
see
such
an
unfortunate
old
Tantalus
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
get
a
good
drop
of
real
water
now
and
again
,
and
I
do
not
pity
him
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
He
be
clever
of
course
,
and
have
make
his
own
way
,
but
I
have
always
a
feeling
that
he
have
no
business
where
he
be
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
shall
know
all
about
it
at
Brooks
's
by
one
o'clock
to
-
morrow

"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
though
it
have
be
past
five
before
he
go
to
bed
,
 
for
there
have
be
much
triumphant
talk
to
be
do
among
liberal
member
after
the
division
,
 
be
up
at
his
breakfast
at
Mrs.
Bunce
's
lodging
by
nine
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
matter
which
he
be
call
upon
to
settle
immediately
in
which
Mrs.
Bunce
herself
be
much
interested
,
and
respect
which
he
have
promise
to
give
an
answer
on
this
very
morning
.
<EOS>
a
set
of
very
dingy
chamber
up
two
pair
of
stair
at
no

9
,
Old
Square
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
to
which
Mr.
Low
have
recommend
him
to
transfer
himself
and
all
his
belonging
,
be
wait
his
occupation
,
should
he
resolve
upon
occupy
them
.
<EOS>
if
he
intend
to
commence
operation
as
a
barrister
,
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
have
chamber
and
a
clerk
;
and
before
he
have
leave
Mr.
Low
's
house
on
Sunday
evening
<EOS>
he
have
almost
give
that
gentleman
authority
to
secure
for
him
these
room
at
no

.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
whether
you
remain
in
Parliament
or
no
,
you
must
make
a
beginning
,
"
Mr.
Low
have
say
;
"
and
how
be
you
even
to
pretend
to
begin
if
you
do
not
have
chamber
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
hope
that
he
may
be
able
to
wean
Phineas
away
from
his
Parliament
bauble
;
 
that
he
may
induce
the
young
barrister
to
give
up
his
madness
,
if
not
this
session
or
the
next
,
at
any
rate
before
a
third
year
have
commence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
be
a
persistent
man
,
like
very
much
when
he
do
like
,
and
love
very
strongly
when
he
do
love
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
many
a
tug
for
Phineas
Finn
before
he
would
allow
that
false
Westminster
Satan
to
carry
off
the
prey
as
altogether
his
own
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
only
get
Phineas
into
the
dingy
chamber
he
may
do
much
!
  
<EOS>
but
Phineas
have
now
become
so
imbued
with
the
atmosphere
of
politic
,
have
be
so
breathe
upon
by
Lady
Laura
and
Barrington
Erle
,
that
he
could
no
longer
endure
the
thought
of
any
other
life
than
that
of
a
life
spend
among
the
lobby
.
<EOS>
a
desire
to
help
to
beat
the
Conservatives
have
fasten
on
his
very
soul
,
and
almost
make
Mr.
Low
odious
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
be
afraid
of
Mr.
Low
,
and
for
the
nonce
would
not
go
to
him
any
more
;
 
but
he
must
see
the
porter
at
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
he
must
write
a
line
to
Mr.
Low
,
and
he
must
tell
Mrs.
Bunce
that
for
the
present
he
would
still
keep
on
her
room
.
<EOS>
His
letter
to
Mr.

be
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
May
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
low
,
  
I
have
make
up
my
mind
against
take
the
chamber
,
and
be
now
off
to
the
Inn
to
say
that
I
shall
not
want
them
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
know
what
you
will
think
of
me
,
and
it
be
very
grievous
to
me
to
have
to
bear
the
hard
judgment
of
a
man
whose
opinion
I
value
so
highly
;
but
,
in
the
tooth
of
your
terribly
strong
argument
,
I
think
that
there
be
something
to
be
say
on
my
side
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
this
seat
in
Parliament
have
come
in
my
way
by
chance
,
and
I
think
it
would
be
pusillanimous
in
me
to
reject
it
,
feel
,
as
I
do
,
that
a
seat
in
Parliament
confer
very
great
honour
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
too
,
very
fond
of
politic
,
and
regard
legislation
as
the
fine
profession
go
.
<EOS>
have
I
any
one
dependent
on
me
,
I
probably
may
not
be
justify
in
follow
the
bent
of
my
inclination
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
all
alone
in
the
world
,
and
therefore
have
a
right
to
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
if
,
after
a
trial
of
one
or
two
session
,
I
should
fail
in
that
which
I
be
attempt
,
it
will
not
even
then
be
too
late
to
go
back
to
the
well
way
.
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
that
at
any
rate
it
be
not
my
intention
to
be
idle
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
how
you
will
fret
and
fume
over
what
I
say
,
and
how
utterly
I
shall
fail
in
bring
you
round
to
my
way
of
thinking
;
but
as
I
must
write
to
tell
you
of
my
decision
,
I
can
not
refrain
from
defend
myself
to
the
good
of
my
ability
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
always
faithfully

PHINEAS

<EOS>
Mr.
Low
receive
this
letter
at
his
chamber
,
and
when
he
have
read
it
,
he
simply
press
his
lip
closely
together
,
place
the
sheet
of
paper
back
in
its
envelope
,
and
put
it
into
a
drawer
at
his
left
hand
.
<EOS>
have
do
this
,
he
go
on
with
what
work
he
have
before
him
,
as
though
his
friend
's
decision
be
a
matter
of
no
consequence
to
him
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
he
be
concern
the
thing
be
do
,
and
there
should
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
so
he
tell
himself
;
but
nevertheless
his
mind
be
full
of
it
all
day
;
and
,
though
he
write
not
a
word
of
answer
to
Phineas
,
he
make
a
reply
within
his
own
mind
to
every
one
of
the
argument
use
in
the
letter

great
honour

how
can

what
come
,
as
he
say
,
by
chance
?
<EOS>
He
have
not
sense
enough
to
understand
that
the
honour
come
from
the
mode
of
win
it
,
and
from
the
mode
of
wear
it
;
and
that
the
very
fact
of
his
be
member
for
Loughshane
at
this
instant
simply
prove
that
Loughshane
should
have
have
no
privilege
to
return
a
member
!
<EOS>
no
one
dependent
on
him
!
<EOS>
be
not
his
father
and
his
mother
and
his
sister
dependent
on
him
as
long
as
he
must
eat
their
bread
till
he
can
earn
bread
of
his
own
?
<EOS>
He
will
never
earn
bread
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
will
always
be
eat
bread
that
other
have
earn
.
<EOS>
"
in
this
way
,
before
the
day
be
over
,
Mr.
Low
become
very
angry
,
and
swear
to
himself
that
he
would
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
but
yet
he
find
himself
create
plan
for
encounter
and
conquer
the
parliamentary
fiend
who
be
at
present
so
cruelly
potent
with
his
pupil
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
the
third
evening
that
he
tell
his
wife
that
Finn
have
make
up
his
mind
not
to
take
chamber
.
<EOS>
"
then
I
would
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
him
,
"
say
Mrs.
Low
,
savagely
.
<EOS>
"
for
the
present
I
can
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
but
neither
now
nor
ever
,
"
say
Mrs.
Low
,
with
great
emphasis
;
"
he
have
be
false
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
,
who
be
a
man
thoroughly
and
thoughtfully
just
at
all
point
;
"
he
have
not
be
false
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
mean
what
he
have
say
,
when
he
be
say
it
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
weak
and
blind
,
and
fly
like
a
moth
to
the
candle
;
one
pity
the
poor
moth
,
and
would
save
him
a
stump
of
his
wing
if
it
be
possible
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
when
he
have
write
his
letter
to
Mr.
Low
,
start
off
for
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
make
his
way
through
the
well
-
know
dreary
street
of
Soho
,
and
through
St.
Giles
's
,
to
Long
Acre
.
<EOS>
He
know
every
corner
well
,
for
he
have
walk
the
same
road
almost
daily
for
the
last
three
year
.
<EOS>
He
have
conceive
a
liking
for
the
route
,
which
he
may
easily
have
change
without
much
addition
to
the
distance
,
by
pass
through
Oxford
Street
and
Holborn
;
but
there
be
an
air
of
business
on
which
he
pride
himself
in
go
by
the
most
direct
passage
,
and
he
declare
to
himself
very
often
that
thing
dreary
and
dingy
to
the
eye
may
be
good
in
themselves
.
<EOS>
Lincoln
's
Inn
itself
be
dingy
,
and
the
Law
Courts
therein
be
perhaps
the
mean
in
which
Equity
ever
disclose
herself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
's
three
room
in
the
Old
Square
,
each
of
them
brown
with
the
binding
of
law
book
and
with
the
dust
collect
on
law
paper
,
and
with
furniture
that
have
be
brown
always
,
and
have
become
browner
with
year
,
<EOS>
be
perhaps
as
unattractive
to
the
eye
of
a
young
pupil
as
any
room
which
be
ever
enter
.
<EOS>
and
the
study
of
the
Chancery
law
itself
be
not
an
alluring
pursuit
till
the
mind
have
come
to
have
some
insight
into
the
beauty
of
its
ultimate
object
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
during
his
three
year
'
course
of
reason
on
these
thing
,
have
teach
himself
to
believe
that
thing
ugly
on
the
outside
may
be
very
beautiful
within
;
and
have
therefore
come
to
prefer
cross
Poland
Street
and
Soho
Square
,
and
so
continue
his
travel
by
the
Seven
Dials
and
Long
Acre
.
<EOS>
His
morning
walk
be
of
a
piece
with
his
morning
study
,
and
he
take
pleasure
in
the
gloom
of
both
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
taste
of
his
palate
have
be
already
change
by
the
glare
of
the
lamp
in
and
about
palatial
Westminster
,
and
he
find
that
St.
Giles
's
be
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
the
way
about
Pall
Mall
and
across
the
Park
to
Parliament
Street
,
or
to
the
Treasury
,
be
much
pleasanter
,
and
the
new
office
in
Downing
Street
,
already
half
build
,
absorb
all
that
interest
which
he
have
hitherto
be
able
to
take
in
the
suggest
but
uncommenced
erection
of
new
Law
Courts
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
as
he
make
his
way
to
the
porter
's
lodge
under
the
great
gateway
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
he
tell
himself
that
he
be
glad
that
he
have
escape
,
at
any
rate
for
a
while
,
from
a
life
so
dull
and
dreary
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
only
sit
in
chamber
at
the
Treasury
instead
of
chamber
in
that
old
court
,
how
much
pleasanter
it
would
be
!
<EOS>
after
all
,
as
regard
that
question
of
income
,
it
may
well
be
that
the
Treasury
chamber
should
be
the
more
remunerative
,
and
the
more
quickly
remunerative
,
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
and
,
as
he
think
,
Lady
Laura
may
be
compatible
with
the
Treasury
chamber
and
Parliament
,
but
could
not
possibly
be
make
compatible
with
Old
Square
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
  
<EOS>
but
nevertheless
there
come
upon
him
a
feeling
of
sorrow
when
the
old
man
at
the
lodge
seem
to
be
rather
glad
than
otherwise
that
he
do
not
want
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
"
then
Mr.
Green
can
have
them
,
"
say
the
porter
;
"
that
will
be
good
news
for
Mr.
Green
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
the
gen'lemen
will
do
for
chamber
if
thing
go
on
as
they
be
go
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Green
be
welcome
to
the
chamber
as
far
as
Phineas
be
concern
;
but
Phineas
feel
nevertheless
a
certain
amount
of
regret
that
he
should
have
be
compel
to
abandon
a
thing
which
be
regard
both
by
the
porter
and
by
Mr.
Green
as
be
so
desirable
.
<EOS>
He
have
however
write
his
letter
to
Mr.
Low
,
and
make
his
promise
to
Barrington
Erle
,
and
be
bind
to
Lady
Laura
Standish
;
and
he
walk
out
through
the
old
gateway
into
Chancery
Lane
,
resolve
that
he
would
not
even
visit
Lincoln
's
Inn
again
for
a
year
.
<EOS>
there
be
certain
book
,
 
law
book
,
 
which
he
would
read
at
such
interval
of
leisure
as
politic
may
give
him
;
but
within
the
precinct
of
the
Inns
of
Court
he
would
not
again
put
his
foot
for
twelve
month
,
let
learn
pundit
of
the
law
,
 
such
for
instance
as
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Low
<EOS>
,
 
say
what
they
may
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
tell
Mrs.
Bunce
,
before
he
leave
his
home
after
breakfast
,
that
he
should
for
the
present
remain
under
her
roof
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
much
gratify
,
not
simply
because
lodging
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
be
less
readily
let
than
chamber
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
but
also
because
it
be
a
great
honour
to
her
to
have
a
member
of
Parliament
in
her
house
.
<EOS>
member
of

not
so
common
about
Oxford
Street
as
they
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Pall
Mall
and
St.
James
's
Square
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Bunce
,
when
he
come
home
to
his
dinner
,
do
not
join
as
heartily
as
he
should
have
do

<EOS>
Mr.

copying

stationer
in
Carey

have
a
strong

how

very

<EOS>
I
shall
just
have
a
few
word
with
Mr.
Low
,
and
see
what
he
say
to
it
.
<EOS>
for
myself
I
do
not
think
half
so
much
of
Parliament
folk
as
some
do
.
<EOS>
They
be
for
promise
everything
before
they
be
elect
;
but
not
one
in
twenty
of
'em
be
as
good
as
his
word

he

there

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunce
be
a
copy
journeyman
,
who
spend
ten
hour
a
day
in
Carey
Street
with
a
pen
between
his
finger
;
and
after
that
he
would
often
spend
two
or
three
hour
of
the
night
with
a
pen
between
his
finger
in
Marlborough
Street
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
thoroughly
hard
-
working
man
,
do
pretty
well
in
the
world
,
for
he
have
a
good
house
over
his
head
,
and
always
could
find
raiment
and
bread
for
his
wife
and
eight
child
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
be
an
unhappy
man
because
he
suffer
from
political
grievance
,
or
,
I
should
more
correctly
say
,
that
his
grievance
be
semi
-
political
and
semi
-
social
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
vote
,
not
be
himself
the
tenant
of
the
house
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
.
<EOS>
the
tenant
be
a
tailor
who
occupy
the
shop
,
whereas
Bunce
occupy
the
whole
of
the
remainder
of
the
premise
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
lodg
,
and
lodger
be
not
as
yet
trust
with
the
franchise
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
idea
,
which
he
himself
admit
to
be
very
raw
,
as
to
the
injustice
of
the
manner
in
which
he
be
pay
for
his
work
.
<EOS>
so
much
a
folio
,
without
reference
to
the
way
in
which
his
work
be
do
,
without
regard
to
the
success
of
his
work
,
with
no
question
ask
of
himself
,
be
,
as
he
think
,
no
proper
way
of
remunerate
a
man
for
his
labour
.
<EOS>
He
have
long
since
join
a
Trade
Union
,
and
for
two
year
past
have
pay
a
subscription
of
a
shilling
a
week
towards
its
fund
.
<EOS>
He
long
to
be
do
some
battle
against
his
superior
,
and
to
be
put
himself
in
opposition
to
his
employer
;
 
not
that
he
object
personally
to
Messrs.
Foolscap
,
Margin
,
and
Vellum
,
who
always
make
much
of
him
as
a
useful
man
;
 
but
because
some
such
antagonism
would
be
manly
,
and
the
fighting
of
some
battle
would
be
the
right
thing
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
if
labour
do
not
mean
to
go
to
the
wall
himself

"
bunce
would
say
to
his

,
"
labour
must
look
alive
,
and
put
somebody
else
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunce
be
a
comfortable
motherly
woman
,
who
love
her
husband
but
hate
politic
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
an
aversion
to
his
superior
in
the
world
because
they
be
superior
,
so
have
she
a
liking
for
them
for
the
same
reason
.
<EOS>
She
despise
people
poor
than
herself
,
and
think
it
a
fair
subject
for
boasting
that
her
child
always
have
meat
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
ever
so
small
a
morsel
,
she
take
care
that
they
have
it
,
in
order
that
the
boast
may
be
maintain
.
<EOS>
the
world
have
once
or
twice
be
almost
too
much
for
her
,
 
when
,
for
instance
,
her
husband
have
be
ill
;
and
again
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
for
the
last
three
month
of
that
long
period
in
which
Phineas
have
omit
to
pay
his
bill
;
but
she
have
keep
a
fine
brave
heart
during
those
trouble
,
and
could
honestly
swear
that
the
child
always
have
a
bit
of
meat
,
though
she
herself
have
be
occasionally
without
it
for
day
together
.
<EOS>
at
such
time
she
would
be
more
than
ordinarily
meek
to
Mr.
Margin
,
and
especially
courteous
to
the
old
lady
who
lodge
in
her
first
-
floor
drawing
-
room
,
 
for
Phineas
live
up
two
pair
of
stair
,
 
and
she
would
excuse
such
servility
by
declare
that
there
be
no
know
how
soon
she
may
want
assistance
.
<EOS>
but
her
husband
,
in
such
emergency
,
would
become
furious
and
quarrelsome
,
and
would
declare
that
Labour
be
go
to
the
wall
,
and
that
something
very
strong
must
be
do
at
once
.
<EOS>
that
shill
which
Bunce
pay
weekly
to
the
Union
she
regard
as
be
absolutely
throw
away
,
 
as
much
so
as
though
he
cast
it
weekly
into
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
tell
him
so
,
over
and
over
again
,
make
heart
-
pierce
allusion
to
the
eight
child
and
to
the
bit
of
meat
.
<EOS>
He
would
always
endeavour
to
explain
to
her
that
there
be
no
other
way
under
the
sun
for
keep
Labour

he
would
do
so
hopelessly
and
altogether
ineffectually
,
and
she
have
come
to
regard
him
as
a
lunatic
to
the
extent
of
that
one
weekly
shilling
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
a
woman
's
instinctive
partiality
for
comeliness
in
a
man
,
and
be
very
fond
of
Phineas
Finn
because
he
be
handsome
.
<EOS>
and
now
she
be
very
proud
of
him
because
he
be
a
member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
,
 
from
her
husband
,
who
have
tell
her
the
fact
with
much
disgust
,
 
that
the
son
of
Dukes
and
Earls
go
into
Parliament
,
and
she
like
to
think
that
the
fine
young
man
to
whom
she
talk
more
or
less
every
day
should
sit
with
the
son
of
Dukes
and
Earls
.
<EOS>
when
Phineas
have
really
bring
distress
upon
her
by
owe
her
some
thirty
or
forty
pound
,
she
could
never
bring
herself
to
be
angry
with
him
,
 
because
he
be
handsome
and
because
he
dine
out
with
Lords
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
triumph
greatly
over
her
husband
,
who
have
desire
to
be
severe
upon
his
aristocratic
debtor
,
when
the
money
have
all
be
pay
in
a
lump
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
he
be
any
great
catch
,
"
Bunce
have
say
,
when
the
prospect
of
their
lodger

departure
have
be
debate
between
them

<EOS>
"
Jacob

his

it

respectable

<EOS>
"
the
only

it
,

way
from
that

"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
return
to
his
lodging
before
he
go
down
to
his
club
,

again
tell
Mrs.
Bunce
that
he
have
altogether
make
up
his

about

stay
here

<EOS>
"
of
course
we
shall
be
only
too
proud

Mr.

it
may
not
perhaps
be
quite
the
place
for
a

I

it
be
quite
the
place

be
very
good
of
you
to

so

Mr.

we
will
do

very
good
to
make
you
comfortable

never
to

he

rough

silly

with
his
radical
nonsense

pay
a
shill
a
week
to
a
nasty
Union
just
for
nothing

<EOS>
still
he
mean
well
,

there
be
not
a
man
who
work
harder
for
his
wife

child

that
I
will
say
of
him
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
do
talk
politic
 
<EOS>
"
  
"

I
like
a
man
to
talk
politic
,
Mrs.
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
for
a
gentleman
in
Parliament
of
course
it
be
proper
;
but
I
never
could
see
what
good
it
could
do
to
a
law
-
stationer
;
and
when
he
talk
of
Labour
go
to
the
wall
,
I
always
ask
him
whether
he
do
not
get
his
wage
regular
last
Saturday
.
<EOS>
but
,
Lord
love
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
when
a
man
as
be
a
journeyman
have
take
up
politic
and
join
a
Trade
Union
,
he
be
not
no
well
than
a
milestone
for
his
wife
to
take
and
talk
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
Phineas
go
down
to
the
Reform
Club
,
and
make
one
of
those
who
be
buzz
there
in
little
crowd
and
utter
their
prophecy
as
to
future
event
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
be
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
that
be
certain
.
<EOS>
whether
Mr.
Mildmay
be
to
come
in
be
uncertain
.
<EOS>
that
he
would
go
to
Windsor
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
morning
be
not
to
be
doubt
;
but
it
be
think
very
probable
that
he
may
plead
his
age
,
and
decline
to
undertake
the
responsibility
of
form
a
Ministry
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
what
then
?
"
say
Phineas
to
his
friend
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
there
will
be
a
choice
out
of
three
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
Duke
,
who
be
the
most
incompetent
man
in
England
;
there
be
Monk
,
who
be
the
most
unfit
;
and
there
be
Gresham
,
who
be
the
most
unpopular
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
it
possible
to
find
a
bad
Prime
Minister
than
either
of
the
three
;
 
but
the
country
afford
no
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
which
would
Mildmay
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
of
them
,
 
one
after
the
other
,
so
as
to
make
the
embarrassment
the
great
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
be
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
's
description
of
the
crisis
;
but
then
it
be
understand
that
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
be
give
to
romance
.
   
<EOS>
the
News
about
Mr.
Mildmay
and
Sir
Everard
 
Fitzgibbon
and
Phineas
start
together
from
Pall
Mall
for
Portman
Square
,
 
as
both
of
them
have
promise
to
call
on
Lady
Laura
,
 
but
Fitzgibbon
turn
in
at
Brooks
's
as
they
walk
up
St.
James
's
Square
,
and
Phineas
go
on
by
himself
in
a
cab
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
belong
here
,
"
say
Fitzgibbon
as
his
friend
enter
the
cab
,
and
Phineas
immediately
begin
to
feel
that
he
would
have
do
nothing
till
he
could
get
into
Brooks
's
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
very
well
to
begin
by
talk
politic
at
the
Reform
Club
.
<EOS>
such
talking
have
procure
for
him
his
seat
at
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
do
now
,
and
something
more
than
talk
be
want
for
any
further
progress
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
as
he
tell
himself
,
of
political
import
be
manage
at
the
Reform
Club
.
<EOS>
no
influence
from
thence
be
ever
bring
to
bear
upon
the
adjustment
of
place
under
the
Government
,
or
upon
the
arrangement
of
cabinet
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
very
well
to
count
vote
at
the
Reform
Club
;
but
after
the
vote
have
be
count
,
 
have
be
count
successfully
,
 
Brooks
's
be
the
place
,
as
Phineas
believe
,
to
learn
at
the
early
moment
what
would
be
the
exact
result
of
the
success
.
<EOS>
He
must
get
into
Brooks
's
,
if
it
may
be
possible
for
him
.
<EOS>
Fitzgibbon
be
not
exactly
the
man
to
propose
him
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
Earl
of
Brentford
would
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
be
at
home
,
and
with
her
be
sit
 
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
intend
to
be
triumphant
as
he
enter
Lady
Laura
's
room
.
<EOS>
He
be
there
with
the
express
purpose
of
triumph
in
the
success
of
their
great
party
,
and
of
singe
a
pleasant
paean
in
conjunction
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
but
his
trumpet
be
put
out
of
tune
at
once
when
he
see
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
He
say
hardly
a
word
as
he
give
his
hand
to
Lady
Laura
,
 
and
then
afterwards
to
Mr.
Kennedy
,
who
choose
to
greet
him
with
this
show
of
cordiality
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
be
satisfied
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
be
that
all
?
<EOS>
I
think
to
have
find
your
joy
quite
irrepressible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
bottle
of
soda
-
water
,
though
it
be
a
very
lively
thing
when
open
,
will
not
maintain
its
vivacity
beyond
a
certain
period
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
you
have
have
your
gas
let
off
already
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
 
yes
;
at
any
rate
,
the
sputtering
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
Nineteen
be
very
well
,
but
the
question
be
whether
we
may
not
have
have
twenty
-
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
have
just
be
say
that
not
a
single
available
vote
have
be
miss
on
our
side
.
<EOS>
He
have
just
come
from
Brooks
's
,
and
that
seem
to
be
what
they
say
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
Mr.
Kennedy
also
be
a
member
of
Brooks
's
!
<EOS>
at
the
Reform
Club
there
certainly
have
be
an
idea
that
the
number
may
have
be
swell
to
twenty
-
one
;
but
then
,
as
Phineas
begin
to
understand
,
nothing
be
correctly
know
at
the
Reform
Club
.
<EOS>
for
an
accurate
appreciation
of
the
political
balance
of
the
day
,
you
must
go
to
Brooks
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
must
of
course
be
right
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
belong
to
Brooks
's
myself
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
only
joke
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
I
suppose
,
no
doubt
that
Lord
de
Terrier
be
out
,
and
that
be
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
probably
tender
his
resignation
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
same
thing
,
"
say
Phineas
,
roughly
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
exactly
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
Should
there
be
any
difficulty
about
Mr.
Mildmay
,
he
may
,
at
the
Queen
's
request
,
make
another
attempt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
with
a
majority
of
nineteen
against
him
!
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
surely
Mr.
Mildmay
be
not
the
only
man
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
Duke
,
and
there
be
Mr.
Gresham
,
 
and
there
be
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
have
at
his
tongue
's
end
all
the
lesson
that
he
have
be
able
to
learn
at
the
Reform
Club
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
hardly
think
the
Duke
would
venture
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
venture
,
nothing
have
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
very
well
to
say
that
the
Duke
be
incompetent
,
but
I
do
not
know
that
anything
very
wonderful
be
require
in
the
way
of
genius
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
have
hold
his
own
in
both
house
successfully
,
and
he
be
both
honest
and
popular
.
<EOS>
I
quite
agree
that
a
Prime
Minister
at
the
present
day
should
be
commonly
honest
,
and
more
than
commonly
popular
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
be
all
for
the
Duke
,
be
you
?
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
again
smile
as
she
speak
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
;
 
<EOS>
if
we
be
desert
by
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
find
it
quite
so
easy
to
make
up
my
mind
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
Mr.
Mildmay
will
form
a
government
;
and
as
long
as
there
be
that
prospect
,
I
need
hardly
commit
myself
to
an
opinion
as
to
his
probable
successor
.
<EOS>
"
then
the
objectionable
Mr.
Kennedy
take
his
leave
,
and
Phineas
be
leave
alone
with
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
glorious
;
 
be
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
begin
,
as
soon
as
he
find
the
field
to
be
open
for
himself
and
his
own
manoeuvring
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
very
young
,
and
have
not
as
yet
learn
the
manner
in
which
he
may
best
advance
his
cause
with
such
a
woman
as
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
be
tell
her
too
clearly
that
he
could
have
no
gratification
in
talk
with
her
unless
he
could
be
allow
to
have
her
all
to
himself
.
<EOS>
that
may
be
very
well
if
Lady
Laura
be
in
love
with
him
,
but
would
hardly
be
the
way
to
reduce
her
to
that
condition
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.

say
she

smile
as

I
be

Phineas

I
be

have
very
little
to

the
comparative

remember

put
down

frown

therefore

continue

talk

why
should
not
Mr.
Kennedy
be
of
use
to
you
as
well

else

You
do
not

all
by
yourself

no

there
be
something
mean
to
me
in
the
expressed
idea

make
use

more
especially
of
a
man

I

Dr.
Fells

You
do
not
like
him
simply
because

do
not
talk
much

that
may
be
a
good
reason
why
you
should
not
make
of
him
an
intimate

talkative

pause
for

some
question

may
produce
from

no

Chancellors

He
have
never
before
dine
at
the
house
of
this
great
law
luminary
,
whose
acquaintance
he
have
make
through
Mr.
Low
,
and
he
have
think
a
great
deal
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Freemantle
have
send
him
the
invitation
nearly
a
fortnight
ago
,

he
understand
there
be
to
be
an
elaborate
dinner
party

do
not
know
it
for
a
fact
,

he
be
in
hope
of
meet
the
expire
Lord
Chancellor

He
consider
it
to
be
his
duty
never
to
throw
away
such
a
chance

<EOS>
He
would
in
all
respect
have
prefer
Mr.
Freemantle
's
dinner
in
Eaton
Place
,
dull
and
heavy
though
it
may
probably
be
,
to
the
chance
of
Lord
Chiltern

companion
at
Moroni
's

whatever
may
be
the
fault

to

generally
call
dissipation
by
the
world
at
large

by
which
the
world
mean
self
-
indulgence

He
care
not
a
brass
farthing
for
Moroni
's
Château
Yquem
,
nor
for
the
wondrously
study
repast
which
he
would
doubtless
find
prepared
for
him
at
that
celebrate
establishment
in
St.
James
's
Street
;
 
not
a
farthing
as
compare
with
the
chance
of
meeting
so
great
a
man
as
Lord
Moles

and
Lord
Chiltern

friend
may
probably
be
just
the
man
whom
he
would
not
desire
to
know

but
Lady
Laura
's
request
override
everything
with
him

She
have
ask
him
to

of
course
he
would
do
so

have
he
be
go
to

would
have

He
be
not
quick
enough
to
make
an
answer
without
hesitation

after
a
moment
's
pause
he
say
he
should
be
most
happy
to
dine
with
Lord
Chiltern
at
Moroni
's

that
be
right

7.30

I

then
the
servant
announce
more
visitor

Lord
Chiltern
escape
out
of

room
before

see
by

new
comer

these
be
Mrs.
Bonteen

Laurence
Fitzgibbon

and
then
Mr.
Bonteen

and
after
them
Mr.
Ratler
,
the
Whip
,
who
be
in
a
violent
hurry
,
and
do
not
stay
there
a
moment
,
and
then
Barrington
Erle
and
young
Lord
James
Fitz
-
Howard
,
the
young
son
of
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
.
<EOS>
in
twenty
or
thirty
minute
there
be
a
gathering
of
liberal
political
notability
in
Lady
Laura
's
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
great
piece
of
news
by
which
they
be
all
enthral
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
would
not
be
Prime
Minister
,
and
Sir
Everard
Powell
be
 
dead
.
<EOS>
of
course
nothing
quite
positive
could
be
know
about
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
be
with
the
Queen
at
Windsor
on
the
morrow
at
eleven
o'clock
,
and
it
be
improbable
that
he
would
tell
his
mind
to
any
one
before
he
tell
it
to
her
Majesty
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
doubt
that
he
have
engage
"
the
Duke
,
"
 
<EOS>
so
he
be
call
by
Lord
James
,
 
to
go
down
to
Windsor
with
him
,
that
he
may
be
in
readiness
if
want
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
learn
that
at
home
,
"
say
Lord
James
,
who
have
just
hear
the
news
from
his
sister
,
who
have
hear
it
from
the
Duchess
.
<EOS>
Lord
James
be
delight
with
the
importance
give
to
him
by
his
father
's
come
journey
.
<EOS>
from
this
,
and
from
other
equally
well
-
know
circumstance
,
it
be
surmise
that
Mr.
Mildmay
would
decline
the
task
propose
to
him
.
<EOS>
this
,
nevertheless
,
be
only
a
surmise
,
 
whereas
the
fact
with
reference
to
Sir
Everard
be
fully
substantiate
.
<EOS>
the
gout
have
fly
to
his
stomach
,
and
he
be
dead
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
 
yes
;
as
dead
as
a
herring
,
"
say
Mr.
Ratler
,
who
at
that
moment
,
however
,
be
not
within
hearing
of
either
of
the
lady
present
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
rub
his
hand
,
and
look
as
though
he
be
delighted
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
delighted
,
 
not
because
his
old
friend
Sir
Everard
be
dead
,
but
by
the
excitement
of
the
tragedy
.
<EOS>
"
have
do
so
good
a
deed
in
his
last
moment
,
"
say
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
"
we
may
take
it
for
grant
that
he
will
go
straight
to
heaven
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
there
will
be
no
crowner
's
quest
,
Ratler
,
"
say
Mr.
Bonteen
;
"
if
there
be
I
do
not
know
how
you
will
get
out
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
anything
in
it
so
horrible
,
"
say
Mr.
Ratler
.
<EOS>
"
if
a
fellow
die
lead
his
regiment
we
do
not
think
anything
of
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
's
vote
be
of
more
service
to
his
country
than
anything
that
a
colonel
or
a
captain
can
do
.
"
<EOS>
but
nevertheless
I
think
that
Mr.
Ratler
be
somewhat
in
dread
of
future

I
can

now

I
do
so
want

You
may

him

<EOS>
in

way
he

very
good

not

not
more
evil

<EOS>
I
be
so
anxious
,
 
so
very
anxious
to
try
to
put
him
on
his
leg

I
find
it
so
difficult

<EOS>
Phineas
walk
down
to
Westminster
with
his
mind
very
full
of
Lady
Laura
and
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
what
do
she
mean
by
her
affectionate
manner
to
himself
,
and
what
do
she
mean
by
the
continual
praise
which
she
lavish
upon
Mr.
Kennedy
?
<EOS>
of
whom
be
she
think
most
,
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
or
of
him
?
<EOS>
She
have
call
herself
his
mentor
.
<EOS>
be
the
description
of
her
feeling
towards
himself
,
as
convey
in
that
name
,
of
a
kind
to
be
gratify
to
him
?
<EOS>
no
;
 
he
think
not
.
<EOS>
but
then
may
it
not
be
within
his
power
to
change
the
nature
of
those
feeling
?
<EOS>
She
be
not
in
love
with
him
at
present
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
make
any
boast
to
himself
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
within
his
power
to
compel
her
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
the
female
mentor
may
be
soften
.
<EOS>
that
she
could
not
love
Mr.
Kennedy
,
he
think
that
he
be
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
like
love
in
her
manner
to
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
as
to
Lord
Chiltern
,
Phineas
would
do
whatever
may
be
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
all
that
he
really
know
of
Lord
Chiltern
be
that
he
have
gamble
and
that
he
have
drunk
.
   
<EOS>
the
New
Government
 
<EOS>
in
the
House
of
Lords
that
night
,
and
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
the
outgoing
Ministers
make
their
explanation
.
<EOS>
as
our
business
at
the
present
moment
be
with
the
Commons
,
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
their
chamber
,
and
will
do
so
the
more
willingly
because
the
upshot
of
what
be
say
in
the
two
place
be
the
same
.
<EOS>
the
outgoing
minister
be
very
grave
,
very
self
-
laudatory
,
and
very
courteous
.
<EOS>
in
regard
to
courtesy
it
may
be
declare
that
no
stranger
to
the
way
of
the
place
could
have
understand
how
such
soft
word
could
be
speak
by
Mr.
Daubeny
,
beat
,
so
quickly
after
the
very
sharp
word
which
he
have
utter
when
he
only
expect
to
be
beat
.
<EOS>
He
announce
to
his
fellow
-
commoner
that
his
right
honourable
friend
and
colleague
Lord
de
Terrier
have
think
it
right
to
retire
from
the
Treasury
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
,
in
constitutional
obedience
to
the
vote
of
the
Lower
House
,
have
resign
,
and
the
Queen
have
be
graciously
pleased
to
accept
Lord
de
Terrier
's
resignation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
could
only
inform
the
House
that
her
Majesty
have
signify
her
pleasure
that
Mr.
Mildmay
should
wait
upon
her
to
-
morrow
at
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
 
so
Mr.
Daubeny
understand
,
 
would
be
with
her
Majesty
to
-
morrow
at
that
hour
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
have
find
it
to
be
his
duty
to
recommend
her
Majesty
to
send
for
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
real
import
of
Mr.
Daubeny
's
speech
.
<EOS>
that
further
portion
of
it
in
which
he
explain
with
bland
,
most
beneficent
,
honey
-
flow
word
that
his
party
would
have
do
everything
that
the
country
could
require
of
any
party
,
have
the
House
allow
it
to
remain
on
the
Treasury
bench
for
a
month
or
two
,
 
and
explain
also
that
his
party
would
never
recriminate
,
would
never
return
evil
for
evil
,
would
in
no
wise
copy
the
factious
opposition
of
their
adversary
;
that
his
party
would
now
,
as
it
ever
have
do
,
carry
itself
with
the
meekness
of
the
dove
,
and
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
,
 
all
this
,
I
say
,
be
so
generally
feel
by
gentleman
on
both
side
of
the
House
to
be
"
leather
and
prunella
"
that
very
little
attention
be
pay
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
great
point
be
that
Lord
de
Terrier
have
resign
,
and
that
Mr.
Mildmay
have
be
summon
to
Windsor
.
  
<EOS>
the
Queen
have
send
for
Mr.
Mildmay
in
compliance
with
advice
give
to
her
by
Lord
de
Terrier
.
<EOS>
and
yet
Lord
de
Terrier
and
his
first
lieutenant
have
use
all
the
most
practised
effort
of
their
eloquence
for
the
last
three
day
in
endeavour
to
make
their
countryman
believe
that
no
more
unfit
Minister
than
Mr.
Mildmay
ever
attempt
to
hold
the
rein
of
office
!
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
too
bad
for
them
to
say
of
Mr.
Mildmay
,
 
and
yet
,
in
the
very
first
moment
in
which
they
find
themselves
unable
to
carry
on
the
government
themselves
,
they
advise
the
Queen
to
send
for
that
most
incompetent
and
baneful
statesman
!
<EOS>
We
who
be
conversant
with
our
own
method
of
politic
,
see
nothing
odd
in
this
,
because
we
be
use
to
it
;
but
surely
in
the
eye
of
stranger
our
practice
must
be
very
singular
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
like
it
in
any
other
country
,
 
nothing
as
yet
.
<EOS>
nowhere
else
be
there
the
same
good
-
humour
,
affectionate
,
prize
-
fight
ferocity
in
politic
.
<EOS>
the
leader
of
our
two
great
party
be
to
each
other
exactly
as
be
the
two
champion
of
the
ring
who
knock
each
other
about
for
the
belt
and
for
five
hundred
pound
a
side
once
in
every
two
year
.
<EOS>
how
they
fly
at
each
other
,
strike
as
though
each
blow
should
carry
death
if
it
be
but
possible
!
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
no
one
whom
the
Birmingham
Bantam
respect
so
highly
as
he
do
<EOS>
Bill
Burns
the
Brighton
Bully
,
or
with
whom
he
have
so
much
delight
in
discuss
the
merit
of
a
pot
of
half
-
and
-
half
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
with
Mr.
Daubeny
and
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
in
private
life
Mr.
Daubeny
almost
adulate
his
eld
rival
,
 
and
Mr.
Mildmay
never
omit
an
opportunity
of
take
Mr.
Daubeny
warmly
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
in
the
United
States
.
<EOS>
there
the
same
political
enmity
exist
,
but
the
political
enmity
produce
private
hatred
.
<EOS>
the
leader
of
party
there
really
mean
what
they
say
when
they
abuse
each
other
,
and
be
in
earnest
when
they
talk
as
though
they
be
about
to
tear
each
other
limb
from
limb
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
Mr.
Daubeny
would
have
injure
a
hair
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
venerable
head
,
even
for
an
assurance
of
six
continue
month
in
office
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Daubeny
have
complete
his
statement
,
Mr.
Mildmay
simply
tell
the
House
that
he
have
receive
and
would
obey
her
Majesty
's
command
.
<EOS>
the
House
would
of
course
understand
that
he
by
no
means
mean
to
aver
that
the
Queen
would
even
commission
him
to
form
a
Ministry
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
take
no
such
command
from
her
Majesty
it
would
become
his
duty
to
recommend
her
Majesty
to
impose
the
task
upon
some
other
person
.
<EOS>
then
everything
be
say
that
have
to
be
say
,
and
member
return
to
their
club
.
<EOS>
a
certain
damp
be
throw
over
the
joy
of
some
excitable
liberal
by
tiding
which
reach
the
House
during
Mr.
Daubeny
's
speech
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
Powell
be
no
more
dead
than
be
Mr.
Daubeny
himself
.
<EOS>
now
it
be
very
unpleasant
to
find
that
your
news
be
untrue
,
when
you
have
be
at
great
pain
to
disseminate
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
he
be
dead
,
"
say
Mr.
Ratler
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lady
Powell
assure
me
half
an
hour
ago
,
"
say
Mr.
Ratler
's
opponent
,
"
that
he
be
at
that
moment
a
great
deal
better
than
he
have
be
for
the
last
three
month
.
<EOS>
the
journey
down
to
the
House
do
him
a
world
of
good
.
"
<EOS>
"
then
we
will
have
him
down
for
every
division
,
"
say
Mr.
Ratler
.
  
<EOS>
the
political
portion
of
London
be
in
a
ferment
for
the
next
five
day
.
<EOS>
on
the
Sunday
morning
it
be
know
that
Mr.
Mildmay
have
decline
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
liberal
Government
.
<EOS>
He
and
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
and
Mr.
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
have
be
in
conference
so
often
,
and
so
long
,
that
it
may
almost
be
say
they
live
together
in
conference
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Gresham
have
be
with
Mr.
Mildmay
,
 
and
Mr.
Monk
also
.
<EOS>
at
the
club
it
be
say
by
many
that
Mr.
Monk
have
be
with
Mr.
Mildmay
;
but
it
be
also
say
very
vehemently
by
other
that
no
such
interview
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
be
a
radical
,
much
admire
by
the
people
,
sit
in
Parliament
for
that
most
radical
of
all
constituency
,
the
Pottery
Hamlets
,
who
have
never
as
yet
be
in
power
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
great
question
of
the
day
whether
Mr.
Mildmay
would
or
would
not
ask
Mr.
Monk
to
join
him
;
and
it
be
say
by
those
who
habitually
think
at
every
period
of
change
that
the
time
have
now
come
in
which
the
difficulty
to
form
a
government
will
at
last
be
find
to
be
insuperable
,
that
Mr.
Mildmay
could
not
succeed
either
with
Mr.
Monk
or
without
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
at
the
present
moment
two
section
of
these
gentleman
,
 
the
section
which
declare
that
Mr.
Mildmay
have
send
for
Mr.
Monk
,
and
the
section
which
declare
that
he
have
not
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
other
,
who
perhaps
know
better
what
they
be
say
,
by
whom
it
be
assert
that
the
whole
difficulty
lie
with
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
be
willing
to
serve
with
Mr.
Mildmay
,
 
with
certain
stipulation
as
to
the
special
seat
in
the
Cabinet
which
he
himself
be
to
occupy
,
and
as
to
the
introduction
of
certain
friend
of
his
own
;
but
,
 
so
say
these
gentleman
who
be
suppose
really
to
understand
the
matter
,
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
be
not
willing
to
serve
with
the
Duke
and
with
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
now
,
everybody
who
know
anything
know
that
the
Duke
and
Mr.
Palliser
be
indispensable
to
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
and
a
liberal
Government
,
with
Mr.
Gresham
in
the
opposition
,
could
not
live
half
through
a
session
!
<EOS>
all
Sunday
and
Monday
these
thing
be
discuss
;
and
on
the
Monday
Lord
de
Terrier
absolutely
state
to
the
Upper
House
that
he
have
receive
her
Majesty
's
command
to
form
another
government
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
,
in
half
a
dozen
most
modest
word
,
 
in
word
hardly
audible
,
and
most
unlike
himself
,
 
make
his
statement
in
the
Lower
House
to
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Ratler
,
and
Mr.
Bonteen
,
and
Mr.
Barrington
Erle
,
and
Mr.
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
arouse
themselves
and
swear
that
such
thing
could
not
be
.
<EOS>
Should
the
prey
which
they
have
win
for
themselves
,
the
spoil
of
their
bow
and
arrow
,
be
snatch
from
out
of
their
very
mouth
by
treachery
?
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
and
Mr.
Daubeny
could
not
venture
even
to
make
another
attempt
unless
they
do
so
in
combination
with
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
such
a
combination
,
say
Mr.
Barrington
Erle
,
would
be
disgraceful
to
both
party
,
but
would
prove
Mr.
Gresham
to
be
as
false
as
Satan
himself
.
<EOS>
early
on
the
Tuesday
morning
,
when
it
be
know
that
Mr.
Gresham
have
be
at
Lord
de
Terrier
's
house
,
Barrington
Erle
be
free
to
confess
that
he
have
always
be
afraid
of
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
feel
for
year
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
if
anybody
could
break
up
the
party
it
would
be
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
that
Tuesday
morning
Mr.
Gresham
certainly
be
with
Lord
de
Terrier
,
but
nothing
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
be
either
not
enough
like
Satan
for
the
occasion
,
or
else
he
be
too
closely
like
him
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
do
not
bid
high
enough
,
or
else
Mr.
Gresham
do
not
like
bidding
from
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
nothing
then
come
from
this
attempt
,
and
on
the
Tuesday
afternoon
the
Queen
again
send
for
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
on
the
Wednesday
morning
the
gentleman
who
think
that
the
insuperable
difficulty
have
at
length
arrive
,
begin
to
wear
their
long
face
,
and
to
be
triumphant
with
melancholy
foreboding
.
<EOS>
now
at
last
there
be
a
dead
lock
.
<EOS>
nobody
could
form
a
government
.
<EOS>
It
be
assert
that
Mr.
Mildmay
have
fall
at
her
Majesty
's
foot
dissolve
in
tear
,
and
have
implore
to
be
relieve
from
further
responsibility
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
known
to
many
at
the
club
that
the
Queen
have
on
that
morning
telegraph
to
Germany
for
advice
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
so
gloomy
as
to
declare
that
the
Queen
must
throw
herself
into
the
arm
of
Mr.
Monk
,
unless
Mr.
Mildmay
would
consent
to
rise
from
his
knee
and
once
more
buckle
on
his
ancient
armour
.
<EOS>
"
even
that
would
be
well
than
Gresham
,
"
say
Barrington
Erle
,
in
his
anger
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
it
be
,
"
say
Ratler
,
"
we
shall
have
Gresham
and
Monk
together
,
and
you
and
I
shall
have
to
do
their
bidding
.

<EOS>
Mr.
Barrington
Erle
's
reply
to
that
suggestion
I
may
not
dare
to
insert
in
these
page
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Wednesday
night
,
however
,
it
be
know
that
everything
have
be
arrange
,
and
before
the
Houses
meet
on
the
Thursday
every
place
have
be
bestow
,
either
in
reality
or
in
imagination
.
<EOS>
the
_
Times

in
its
second
edition
on
the
Thursday
,
give
a
list
of
the
Cabinet

in
which
four
place

<EOS>
on
the
Friday
it
name
ten
place
aright
,
and
indicate
the
law
officer
,
with
only
one
mistake
in
reference
to
Ireland
;
and
on
the
Saturday
it
give
a
list
of
the
Under
Secretaries
of
State
,
and
Secretaries
and
Vice
-
president
generally
,
with
wonderful
correctness
as
to
the
individual
,
though
the
office
be
a
little
jumbled
.
<EOS>
the
Government
be
at
last
form
in
a
manner
which
everybody
have
see
to
be
the
only
possible
way
in
which
a
government
could
be
form
.
<EOS>
nobody
be
surprised
,
and
the
week
's
work
be
regard
as
though
the
regular
routine
of
government
making
have
simply
be
follow
.
<EOS>
Mr.

of
the
Council
;
the
Earl
of
Brentford
be
Privy

and
Mr.
Palliser
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
make
a
step
up
in
the
world
,
and
go
to
the
Admiralty
as
Secretary
;
Mr.
Bonteen
be
send
again
to
the
Admiralty
;
and
Laurence
Fitzgibbon

Lord

the
Treasury
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
be
,
of
course
,
instal
as
Patronage
Secretary
to
the
same
Board
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
be
perhaps
the
only
man
in
the
party
as
to
whose
destination
there
could
not
possibly
be
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
have
really
qualify
himself
for
a
position
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
all
man
feel
that
he
would
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
be
call
upon
to
fill
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
as
much
could
be
say
on
behalf
of
any
other
man
in
the
new
Government
.
  
<EOS>
during
all
this
excitement
,
and
through
all
these
movement
,
Phineas
Finn
feel
himself
to
be
leave
more
and
more
out
in
the
cold
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
such
a
fool
as
to
suppose
that
any
office
would
be
offer
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
hint
at
such
a
thing
to
his
one
dearly
intimate
friend
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
hitherto
open
his
mouth
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
when
the
new
Government
be
form
he
have
not
be
sit
for
above
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
of
course
nothing
could
be
do
for
him
as
yet
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
feel
himself
to
be
out
in
the
cold
.
<EOS>
the
very
man
who
have
discuss
with
him
the
question
of
the
division
,
 
who
have
discuss
it
with
him
because
his
vote
be
then
as
good
as
that
of
any
other
member
,
 
do
not
care
to
talk
to
him
about
the
distribution
of
place
.
<EOS>
He
,
at
any
rate
,
could
not
be
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
,
at
any
rate
,
could
not
be
a
rival
.
<EOS>
He
could
neither
mar
nor
assist
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
either
a
successful
or
a
disappointed
sympathiser
,
 
because
he
could
not
himself
be
a
candidate
.
<EOS>
the
affair
which
perhaps
disgust
him
more
than
anything
else
be
the
offer
of
an
office
,
 
not
in
the
Cabinet
,
indeed
,
but
one
suppose
to
confer
high
dignity
,
 
to
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
refuse
the
offer
,
and
this
somewhat
lessen
Finn
's
disgust
,
but
the
offer
itself
make
him
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
make
simply
because
of
his
money
,
"
he
say
to
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
that
,
"
say
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
People
seem
to
think
that
he
have
get
a
head
on
his
shoulder
,
though
he
have
get
no
tongue
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
his
refusing
it
because
of
the
Right
Honourable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
that
Mr.
Kennedy
refuse
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
why
?
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
the
Right
Hon
.
<EOS>
Robert
Kennedy
for
ever
and
ever
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
phineas
when
he
say
this
do
not
as
yet
know
exactly
how
it
would
have
come
to
pass
that
such
honour
,
 
the
honour
of
the
endure
prefix
to
his
name
,
 
would
have
come
in
the
way
of
Mr.
Kennedy
<EOS>
have
Mr.
Kennedy
accept
the
office
in
question
;
but
he
be
very
quick
to
learn
all
these
thing
,
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
he
rarely
make
any
mistake
about
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
would
that
have
be
to
him
,
 
with
his
wealth
?
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
a
position
of
his
own
and
need
not
care
for
such
thing
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
who
should
not
attempt
what
be
call
independence
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
by
do
so
they
simply
decline
to
make
themselves
useful
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
few
whose
special
walk
in
life
it
be
to
be
independent
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
unmove
by
party

"

"
Great
Akinetoses

Mr.

"
He
hold
a

<EOS>
"
a
very
proud
position
indeed

Lady

,
in
sober

<EOS>
the
dinner
at
Moroni
's
have
be
eat
,
and
Phineas
have
give
an
account
of
the
entertainment
to
Lord
Chiltern

<EOS>
there
have
be
only
two
other

both

<EOS>
"
I
be

Phineas

he
surprise
me
ever
so
much

me

<EOS>
"
yes

I
do
so

I

I
want
him

know
some
man

think
of
something
besides
horse

<EOS>
He
be
very
well
educate

you
know

would
certainly
have
take
honour
if
he

<EOS>
"
do
he
take
a

no

send
him
down

It
be
good
always
to
have
the
truth
among
friend

<EOS>
of
course
you
will
hear
it
some
day

<EOS>
They
expel
him
because
he
be
drunk

<EOS>
then
Lady
Laura
burst
out
into
tear

and
Phineas
sit
near
her

and
console
her
,
and
swear
that
if
in
any
way
he
could

brother
he

so

<EOS>
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
at
this
time
claim
a
promise

he
say
that
Phineas

make
to
him

that
Phineas

go
over

him

Mayo

Lady

Lady

infinite
delight

It

her
ambition

bring
as
near
to
political
action
as
be
possible
for
a
woman
without
surrender
any
of
the
privilege
of
feminine
inaction

<EOS>
that
woman
should
even
wish
to
have
vote
at
parliamentary
election
be
to
her
abominable

the
cause
of
the

in
think
that
she

be
perhaps
,
in

degree

politically
powerful
;
and
she
have
receive
considerable
increase
to
such
hope
when
her
father
accept
the
Privy
Seal

<EOS>
the
Earl
himself
be
not
an
ambitious
man

,

for
his

would
have
sever
himself
altogether
from
political
life

be
an
unhappy
man

be
an
obstinate
man

have
in
his
obstinacy
quarrel

in

keep
himself
alone

live

brood

it
not

on
her
behalf

and
in
obedience
to
her
requirement

he
come
yearly
up
to
London

and
,
perhaps
in
compliance
with
her
persuasion
,
have
take
some
part
in
the
debate
of
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
It
be
easy
for
a
peer
to
be
a
statesman
,
if
the
trouble
of
the
life
be
not
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
be
now
a
statesman
,
if
a
seat
in
the
Cabinet
be
proof
of
statesmanship
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
time
,
in
May
,
there
be
stay
with
Lady
Laura
in
Portman
Square
a
very
dear
friend
of
hers
,
by
name
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
be
an
orphan
,
an
heiress
,
and
a
beauty
;
with
a
terrible
aunt
,
one
Lady
Baldock
,
who
be
suppose
to
be
the
dragon
who
have
Violet
,
as
a
captive
maiden
,
in
charge
.
<EOS>
but
as
Miss
Effingham
be
of
age
,
and
be
mistress
of
her
own
fortune
,
Lady
Baldock
be
,
in
truth
,
not
omnipotent
as
a
dragon
should
be
.
<EOS>
the
dragon
,
at
any
rate
,
be
not
now
stay
in
Portman
Square
,
and
the
captivity
of
the
maiden
be
therefore
not
severe
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
be
very
pretty
,
but
could
hardly
be
say
to
be
beautiful
.
<EOS>
She
be
small
,
with
light
crispy
hair
,
which
seem
to
be
ever
on
the
flutter
round
her
brow
,
and
which
yet
be
never
a
hair
astray
.
<EOS>
She
have
sweet
,
soft
grey
eye
,
which
never
look
at
you
long
,
hardly
for
a
moment
,
 
but
which
yet
,
in
that
half
moment
,
nearly
kill
you
by
the
power
of
their
sweetness
.
<EOS>
Her
cheek
be
the
soft
thing
in
nature
,
and
the
colour
of
it
,
when
its
colour
be
fix
enough
to
be
tell
,
be
a
shade
of
pink
so
faint
and
creamy
that
you
would
hardly
dare
to
call
it
by
its
name
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
be
perfect
,
not
small
enough
to
give
that
expression
of
silliness
which
be
so
common
,
but
almost
divine
,
with
the
temptation
of
its
full
,
rich
,
ruby
lip
.
<EOS>
Her
tooth
,
which
she
but
seldom
show
,
be
very
even
and
very
white
,
and
there
rest
on
her
chin
the
dear
dimple
that
ever
act
as
a
loadstar
to
mens
's
eye
.
<EOS>
the
fault
of
her
face
,
if
it
have
a
fault
,
be
in
her
nose
,
 
which
be
a
little
too
sharp
,
and
perhaps
too
small
.
<EOS>
a
woman
who
want
to
depreciate
Violet
Effingham
have
once
call
her
a
pug
-
nosed
puppet
;
but
I
,
as
her
chronicler
,
deny
that
she
be
pug
-
nosed
,
 
and
<EOS>
all
the
world
who
know
her
soon
come
to
understand
that
she
be
no
puppet
.
<EOS>
in
figure
she
be
small
,
but
not
so
small
as
she
look
to
be
.
<EOS>
Her
foot
and
hand
be
delicately
fine
,
and
there
be
a
softness
about
her
whole
person
,
an
apparent
compressibility
,
which
seem
to
indicate
that
she
may
go
into
very
small
compass
.
<EOS>
into
what
compass
and
<EOS>
how
compress
,
there
be
very
many
man
who
hold
very
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
be
certainly
no
puppet
.
<EOS>
She
be
great
at
dancing
,
 
as
perhaps
may
be
a
puppet
,
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
great
also
at
archery
,
great
at
skating
,
 
and
great
,
too
,
at
hunting
.
<EOS>
with
reference
to
that
last
accomplishment
,
she
and
Lady
Baldock
have
have
more
than
one
terrible
tussle
,
not
always
with
advantage
to
the
dragon
.

"

My
dear

Violet

of

,
after
all
,
what
sort
of
love
be
it
?
<EOS>
It
be
just
as
when
you

when
we
see
something
nice
in
a
shop

call
it
a
dear
duck
of

tell
somebody
to
go

buy
it

already

close

then
there
will
be
cut

tragedy

I
shall
never
go
beyond
genteel
comedy

away
with
somebody
beneath

out

prettily

not

call

I
can
like
a
man

I
do

perhaps
,
half
a
dozen

I
like
them
so
much
that
if
I
go
to
a
house

to
a
party
it
be
quite
a
matter
of
importance
to
me
whether
this
man

that
will

will
not
be
there

then
I

I
flirt
with

at

Augusta
tell
me

that
I
do

for
care

way

love
him

want
to

have
him
all
to
myself

that
sort

certainly
I
do

I
do

I
be
heartily
tired
of
Lady
Baldock

though
I
can
generally
escape
among
my
friend

that
be
not
sufficient
.
<EOS>
I
be
begin
to
think
that
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
a
house
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
a
girl
become
such
a
Bohemian
when
she
be
always
go
about
,

do
not
quite
know
where
any
of
her
thing
be

"
  
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
silence
between
them
for
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
be
double
up
in
a
corner
of
a
sofa
,
with
her
foot
tuck
under
her
,
and
her
face
recline
upon
one
of
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
and
as
she
talk
she
be
play
with
a
little
toy
which
be
construct
to
take
various
shape
as
it
be
flung
this
way
or
that
.
<EOS>
a
bystander
look
at
her
would
have
think
that
the
toy
be
much
more
to
her
than
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
be
sit
upright
,
in
a
common
chair
,
at
a
table
not
far
from
her
companion
,
and
be
manifestly
devoting
herself
altogether
to
the
subject
that
be
be
discuss
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
take
no
lounge
,
easy
attitude
,
she
have
find
no
employment
for
her
finger
,
and
she
look
steadily
at
Violet
as
she
talk
,
 
whereas
Violet
be
look
only
at
the
little
manikin
which
she
toss
.
<EOS>
and
now
Laura
get
up
and
come
to
the
sofa
,
and
sit
close
to
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Violet
,
though
she
somewhat
move
one
foot
,
so
as
to
seem
to
make
room
for
the
other
,
still
go
on
with
her
play
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
marry
,
Violet
,
you
must
choose
some
one
man
out
of
the
lot
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
quite
true

my
dear

I
certainly
can
not

them
all

how
do
you
mean
to
make
the
choice
?

<EOS>

I
do

shall
toss
up

you
would

in

well

I
will
be
in

shall
take
the
first
that
come

quite
make
up
my
mind

You
will
think
it
very
horrible

that

really
what
I
shall
do

<EOS>
after
all
,
a
husband
be
very
much
like
a
house

a
horse
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
take
your
house
because
it
be
the
good
house
in
the
world
,

because
just
then
you
want
a
house
.
<EOS>
You
go
and
see
a
house
,
and
if
it
be
very
nasty
<EOS>
you
do
not
take
it
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
think
it
will
suit
pretty
well
,
and
if
you
be
tired
of
look
about
for
house
,
you
do
take
it
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
way
one
buy
one
's
horse
,
 
and
one
's
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

you
have
not

up
your
mind
yet

<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
be
a
little
more
decent
than
usual
just
before
I
leave
Baddingham
.
<EOS>
when
I
tell
her
that
I
mean
to
have
a
pair
of
pony
,
she
merely
throw
up
her
hand
and
grunt
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
gnash
her
tooth
,
and
curse
and
swear
,
and
declare
to
me
that
I
be
a
child
of
perdition
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
by
curse
and

"
She
tell
me
once
that
if
I
buy
a
certain
little
dog
,
it
would
lead
to
my
being
everlastingly
 
<EOS>
you
know
what

She
be
not
so
squeamish
as
I
be
,

say
it
out

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
do
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
buy
the
little
dog
,
and
it
bite
my
aunt
's
heel
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
then
,
and
give
the
creature
to
Mary
Rivers
.
<EOS>
He
be
such
a
beauty
!
<EOS>
I
hope
the
perdition
have
go
with
him

I
do
not
like
Mary
Rivers
at
all

I
have
to
give
the
poor
beasty
to
somebody

Mary
Rivers
happen
to
be
there

I
tell
her
that
Puck

with
Apollyon

she
do
not

Puck
be
worth
twenty

sell

Fancy

that

to
this

that
you

call
me
hard

Laura

I
should
like
to

your

I

like

enough

I
should
like
well
enough
to
be
Chiltern

friend

<EOS>
I
be
his
friend

<EOS>
nothing
that
any

estrange
me

I

fight

black
in

<EOS>
yes
,
I
have
,
 
with
my

I
be
afraid

be
his

<EOS>
the
risk
would
be
so
great

<EOS>
suppose
that
I
do
not

him

that
he
bring
me
to

<EOS>

that

Could
it
not

<EOS>
I

it
may

so
very
well

<EOS>
when
I
be
a
child
they
use

be
always
tell
me
to

myself

It
seem
to
me
that
a

not

themselves

let

do

they

a

very
hard

it

yes

to

"
  
"
the
truth
be

that

He

I

I

out

I

he

noble

minded

I
will
call

paroxysm

these

be
he
not

He
be
,

not
deeply

every

mind

I

He
have
never
lie

tell

everything

His

I
do
not

I
speak
only
of

dangerous

a
paroxysm
of
spend
money

apt

make
one
so
uncomfortable

then
 
"

well

I

You
mean

I
do
not

so

<EOS>
People
say
so

the

say
so

as
I
always
find
her
saying

I
suppose
this
be

the
rest

It
be
untrue

it
be

paroxysm

now

do
not

his

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

but
you
see
,
if
I
be
to
be
his

it
be
 
rather
important

<EOS>

still
you
need
not

me

"
  
<EOS>
"
dear

you
know
I
do
not
ridicule
you

You
know
I
love
you
for
what
you
be
do

<EOS>
Would
not
I
do
the

,
and
fight
for
him
down
to
my
nail
if
I
have
a
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
therefore
I
want
you
to
be
Oswald
's
wife
;
 
because
I
know
that
you
would
fight
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
true
that
he
be
a
 
drunkard
.
<EOS>
look
at
his
hand
,
which
be
as
steady
as
yours
.
<EOS>
look
at
his
eye
.
<EOS>
be
there
a
sign
of
it
?
<EOS>
He
have
be
drunk
,
once

twice
,
perhaps
,
 
and
have
do
fearful
thing
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
that
he
would
do
fearful
thing
to
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
know
a
man
with
a
soft
heart

with

fine
spirit

<EOS>
I
believe
as
I
sit
here
that
if
he
be
marry
to
-
morrow
,
his
vice
would
fall
from
him
like
old
clothe

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
admit
,
Laura
,
that
there
will
be
some
risk
for
the
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
there
will
be
a
risk
.
<EOS>
be
there
not
always
a
risk
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
man
in
the
city
would
call
this
double
-
dangerous
,
I
think
,
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
then
the
door
be
open
,
and
the
man
of
whom
they
be
speak
enter
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
 
<EOS>
the
reader
have
be
tell
that
Lord
Chiltern
be
a
red
man
,
and
that
peculiarity
of
his
personal
appearance
be
certainly
the
first
to
strike
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
It
impart
a
certain
look
of
ferocity
to
him
,
which
be
apt
to
make
man
afraid
of
him
at
first
sight
.
<EOS>
woman
be
not
actuate
in
the
same
way
,
and
be
accustomed
to
look
deep
into
man
at
the
first
sight
than
other
man
will
trouble
themselves
to
do
.
<EOS>
His
beard
be
red
,
and
be
clip
,
so
as
to
have
none
of
the
softness
of
wave
hair
.
<EOS>
the
hair
on
his
head
also
be
keep
short
,
and
be
very
red
,
 
and
the
colour
of
his
face
be
red
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
be
a
handsome
man
,
with
well
-
cut
feature
,
not
tall
,
but
very
strongly
build
,
and
with
a
certain
curl
in
the
corner
of
his
eyelid
which
give
to
him
a
look
of
resolution
,
 
which
perhaps
he
do
not
possess
.
<EOS>
He
be
know
to
be
a
clever
man
,
and
when
very
young
have
have
the
reputation
of
be
a
scholar
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
three
-
and
-
twenty
grey
-
haired
votary
of
the
turf
declare
that
he
would
make
his
fortune
on
the
race
-
course
,
 
so
clear
-
headed
be
he
as
to
odd
,
so
excellent
a
judge
of
a
horse
's
performance
,
and
so
gifted
with
a
memory
of
event
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
five
-
and
-
twenty
<EOS>
he
have
lose
every
shilling
of
a
fortune
of
his
own
,
have
squeeze
from
his
father
more
than
his
father
ever
choose
to
name
in
speaking
of
his
affair
to
any
one
,
and
be
know
to
be
in
debt
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
sacrifice
himself
on
one
or
two
memorable
occasion
in
conformity
with
turf
law
of
honour
,
and
man
say
of
him
,
either
that
he
be
very
honest
or
very
chivalric
,
 
in
accordance
with
the
special
view
on
the
subject
of
the
man
who
be
speak
.
<EOS>
It
be
report
now
that
he
no
longer
own
horse
on
the
turf
;
 
but
this
be
doubt
by
some
who
could
name
the
animal
which
they
say
that
he
own
,
and
which
he
run
in
the
name
of
Mr.
Macnab
,
 
<EOS>
say
some
;
of
Mr.
Pardoe
,
 
say
other
;
of
Mr.
Chickerwick
<EOS>
,
 
say
a
third
set
of
informant
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
that
Lord
Chiltern
at
this
moment
have
no
interest
of
his
own
in
any
horse
upon
the
turf
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
the
world
know
that
he
drink
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
by
the
throat
a
proctor
's
bull
-
dog
when
he
have
be
drunk
at
Oxford
,
have
nearly
strangle
the
man
,
and
have
be
expel
.
<EOS>
He
have
fall
through
his
violence
into
some
terrible
misfortune
at
Paris
,
have
be
bring
before
a
public
judge
,
and
his
name
and
his
infamy
have
be
make
notorious
in
every
newspaper
in
the
two
capital
.
<EOS>
after
that
he
have
fight
a
ruffian
at
Newmarket
,
and
have
really
kill
him
with
his
fist
.
<EOS>
in
reference
to
this
latter
affray
it
have
be
prove
that
the
attack
have
be
make
on
him
,
that
he
have
not
be
to
blame
,
and
that
he
have
not
be
drunk
.
<EOS>
after
a
prolonged
investigation
he
have
come
forth
from
that
affair
without
disgrace
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
do
so
,
at
least
,
if
he
have
not
be
heretofore
disgrace
.
<EOS>
but
we
all
know
how
the
man
well
speak
of
may
steal
a
horse
,
while
he
who
be
of
evil
repute
may
not
look
over
a
hedge
.
<EOS>
It
be
assert
widely
by
many
who
be
suppose
to
know
all
about
everything
that
Lord
Chiltern
be
in
a
fit
of
delirium
tremen
when
he
kill
the
ruffian
at
Newmarket
.
<EOS>
the
bad
of
that
latter
affair
be
that
it
produce
the
total
estrangement
which
now
exist
between
Lord
Brentford
and
his
son
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
would
not
believe
that
his
son
be
in
that
matter
more
sin
against
than
sin
.
<EOS>
"
such
thing
do
not
happen
to
other
man
's
son
,
"
he
say
,
when
Lady
Laura
plead
for
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
could
not
induce
her
father
to
see
his
son
,
but
so
far
prevail
that
no
sentence
of
banishment
be
pronounce
against
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
son
sit
at
his
father
's
table
if
he
so
pleased
.
<EOS>
He
never
do
so
please
,
 
but
nevertheless
he
continue
to
live
in
the
house
in
Portman
Square
;
and
when
he
meet
the
Earl
,
in
the
hall
,
perhaps
,
or
on
the
staircase
,
would
simply
bow
to
him
.
<EOS>
then
the
Earl
would
bow
again
,
and
shuffle
on
,
 
and
look
very
wretched
,
as
no
doubt
he
be
.
<EOS>
a
grow
-
up
son
must
be
the
great
comfort
a
man
can
have
,
 
if
he
be
his
father
's
good
friend
;
but
otherwise
he
can
hardly
be
a
comfort
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
in
this
house
,
the
son
be
a
constant
thorn
in
his
father
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
do
when
we
leave
London
?
"
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
once
say
to
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
stay
here
,
papa

<EOS>
"
but
he
hunt
still

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
he
hunt
,
 
and
he
have
a
room
somewhere
at
an
inn
,
 
down
in
Northamptonshire
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
mostly
in
London
.
<EOS>
They
have
train
on
purpose

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
life
for
my
son
!
"
say
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
a
life
!
<EOS>
of
course
no
decent
person
will
let
him
into
his
house
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
this
,
for
in
truth
Lord
Chiltern
be
not
fond
of
stay
at
the
house
of
person
whom
the
Earl
would
have
call
decent
.
  
<EOS>
General
Effingham
,
the
father
of
Violet
,
and
Lord
Brentford
have
be
the
close
and
dearest
of
friend
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
young
man
in
the
same
regiment
,
and
through
life
each
have
confide
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
when
the
General
's
only
son
,
then
a
youth
of
seventeen
,
be
kill
in
one
of
our
grand
New
Zealand
war
,
the
bereave
father
and
the
Earl
have
be
together
for
a
month
in
their
sorrow
.
<EOS>
at
that
time
Lord
Chiltern
's
career
have
still
be
open
to
hope
,
 
and
the
one
man
have
contrast
his
lot
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
General
Effingham
live
long
enough
to
hear
the
Earl
declare
that
his
lot
be
the
happy
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
now
the
General
be
dead
,
and
Violet
,
the
daughter
of
a
second
wife
,
be
all
that
be
leave
of
the
Effinghams
.
<EOS>
this
second
wife
have
be
a
Miss
Plummer
,
a
lady
from
the
city
with
much
money
,
whose
sister
have
marry
Lord
Baldock
.
<EOS>
violet
in
this
way
have
fall
to
the
care
of
the
Baldock
people
,
and
not
into
the
hand
of
her
father
's
friend
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
reader
will
have
surmise
,
she
have
idea
of
her
own
of
emancipate
herself
from
Baldock
thraldom
.
  
<EOS>
twice
before
that
last
terrible
affair
at
Newmarket
,
before
the
quarrel
between
the
father
and
the
son
have
be
complete
,
Lord
Brentford
have
say
a
word
to
his
daughter
,
 
merely
a
word
,
 
of
his
son
in
connection
with
Miss
Effingham
.

"
if
he
think
of
it
I
shall

may
tell
him
so

that

just
then

as
condone

as
among
the
thing
to

have
be
speak
immediately
subsequent
to
a
payment
of
twelve
thousand
pound
make
by
the
Earl
towards
the
settlement
of
certain
Doncaster
account
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
in
negotiate
for
the
money
have
be
very
eloquent
in
describe
some
honest
,
 
or
shall
we
say
chivalric
,
 
sacrifice
which
have
bring
her
brother
into
this
special
difficulty
.
<EOS>
since
that
the
Earl
have
decline
to
interest
himself
in
his
son
's
matrimonial
affair
;
and
when
Lady
Laura
have
once
again
mention
the
matter
,
declare
her
belief
that
it
would
be
the
mean
of
save
her
brother
Oswald
,
the
Earl
have
desire
her
to
be
silent
.
"
<EOS>
Would
you
wish
to
destroy
the
poor
child
?
<EOS>
"
he
have
say
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
Lady
Laura
feel
sure
that
if
she
be
to
go
to
her
father
with
a
positive
statement
that
Oswald
and
Violet
be
engage
,
he
would
relent
and
would
accept
Violet
as
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
payment
of
Lord
Chiltern
's
present
debt
;
 
she
have
a
little
scheme
of
her
own
about
that
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
,
who
have
be
already
two
day
in
Portman
Square
,
have
not
as
yet
see
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
he
live
in
the
house
,
that
is
,
that
he
sleep
there
,
and
probably
eat
his
breakfast
in
some
apartment
of
his
own
;
 
but
she
know
also
that
the
habit
of
the
house
would
not
by
any
mean
make
it
necessary
that
they
should
meet
.
<EOS>
Laura
and
her
brother
probably
see
each
other
daily
,
 
but
they
never
go
into
society
together
,
and
do
not
know
the
same
set
of
people
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
announce
to
Lady
Baldock
her
intention
of
spend
the
first
fortnight
of
her
London
season
with
her
friend
Lady
Laura
<EOS>
,
Lady
Baldock
have
as
a
matter
of
course
 
"
jump
upon
her
,
"
as
Miss
Effingham
would
herself
call
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
to
the
house
of
the
bad
reprobate

England

"
what

always---

it
be
quite
unfit
that
I
should
speak
a
word
more
to
you
about
such
a
man
as
Lord
Chiltern

<EOS>
His
name
ought
never

<EOS>
Lady

's
process
of
jump
upon
her
niece

in
which
I
think
the
aunt
have
generally
the
bad
of
the
exercise

,
 
go
on
for
some
time

but
Violet
of

carry
her
point

if
she

him
there
will
be
an
end

to
her

She

I

"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern

now
in
the

immediately
upon
that
conversation
between
Violet
and
his

as
to
the
expediency
of
Violet

his

<EOS>
indeed
his
entrance
have
interrupt
the
conversation
before
it

over

<EOS>

I
be
so
glad
to

you

up
from

give
him
her

<EOS>
"
Laura
and
I

be

She
could
not
help
look
,
first
at
his
eye

then
at
his
hand
,
not
as
want
evidence
to
the
truth
of
the
statement
which
his

have
make
,
but
because
the
idea
of
a
drunkard
's
eye
and
a
drunkard
's
hand
have
be
bring
before
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
's
hand
be
like
the
hand
of
any
other
man

there
be
something
in
his
eye
that
almost
frighten
her

It
look
as
though
he
would
not
hesitate
to
wring
his
wife
's
neck
round
,
if
ever
he
should
be
bring
to
threaten
to
do
so

his
eye

the
rest

be
red

<EOS>
no
;
 
she
do
not
think
that
she
could
ever
bring
herself
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
why
take
a
venture
that
be
double
-
dangerous
,
when
there
be
so
many
venture
open
to
her
,
apparently
with
very
little
of
danger
attach
to
them

<EOS>
"
if
it
should
ever

<EOS>
how
often
have
he
meditate
do
so
;
how
he
have
compose
his
speech
walk
round
the
Park
on
his
way
down
to
the
House
;
how
he
get
his
subject
up
,
 
only
to
find
on
hear
them
discuss
that
he
really
know
little
or
nothing
about
them
;
how
he
have
his
argument
and
almost
his
very
word
take
out
of
his
mouth
by
some
other
member
;
and
lastly
,
how
he
have
actually
be
deter
from
get
upon
his
leg
by
a
certain
tremor
of
blood
<EOS>
round
his
heart
when
the
moment
for
rise
have
come
,
 
of
all
this
<EOS>
he
never
say
a
word
to
any
man
.
<EOS>
since
that
last
journey
to
county
Mayo
,
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
have
be
his
most
intimate
friend
,
but
he
say
nothing
of
all
this
even
to
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
to
his
other
friend
,
Lady
Laura
Standish
,
he
do
explain
something
of
his
feeling
,
not
absolutely
describe
to
her
the
extent
of
hindrance
to
which
his
modesty
have
subject
him
,
but
let
her
know
that
he
have
his
qualm
as
well
as
his
aspiration
.
<EOS>
but
as
Lady
Laura
always
recommend
patience
,
and
more
than
once
express
her
opinion
that
a
young
member
would
be
well
to
sit
in
silence
at
least
for
one
session
,
he
be
not
drive
to
the
mortification
of
feeling
that
he
be
incur
her
contempt
by
his
bashfulness
.
<EOS>
as
regard
the
man
among
whom
he
live
,
I
think
he
be
almost
annoy
at
find
that
no
one
seem
to
expect
that
he
should
speak
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
,
when
he
have
first
talk
of
send
Phineas
down
to
Loughshane
,
have
predict
for
him
all
manner
of
parliamentary
success
,
and
have
express
the
warm
admiration
of
the
manner
in
which
Phineas
have
discuss
this
or
that
subject
at
the
Union
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
above
one
or
two
man
in
the
House
who
can
do
that
kind
of
thing
,
"
Barrington
Erle
have
once
say
.
<EOS>
but
now
no
allusion
whatever
be
make
to
his
power
of
speech
,
and
Phineas
in
his
modest
moment
begin
to
be
more
amazed
than
ever
that
he
should
find
himself
seat
in
that
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
to
the
form
and
technicality
of
parliamentary
business
he
do
give
close
attention
,
and
be
unremitte
in
his
attendance
.
<EOS>
on
one
or
two
occasion
he
venture
to
ask
a
question
of
the
Speaker
,
and
as
the
word
of
experience
fall
into
his
ear
,
he
would
tell
himself
that
he
be
go
through
his
education
,
 
that
he
be
learn
to
be
a
work
member
,
and
perhaps
to
be
a
statesman
.
<EOS>
but
his
regret
with
reference
to
Mr.
Low
and
the
dingy
chamber
in
Old
Square
be
very
frequent
;
and
have
it
be
possible
for
him
to
undo
all
that
he
have
do
,
he
would
often
have
abandon
to
some
one
else
the
honour
of
represent
the
elector
of
Loughshane
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
support
in
all
his
difficulty
by
the
kindness
of
his
friend
,
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
be
often
in
the
house
in
Portman
Square
,
and
be
always
receive
with
cordiality
,
and
,
as
he
think
,
almost
with
affection
.
<EOS>
She
would
sit
and
talk
to
him
,
sometimes
say
a
word
about
her
brother
and
sometimes
about
her
father
,
as
though
there
be
more
between
them
than
the
casual
intimacy
of
London
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
and
in
Portman
Square
he
have
be
introduce
to
Miss
Effingham
,
and
have
find
Miss
Effingham
to
be
 
very
nice
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
have
quite
take
to
him
,
and
he
have
dance
with
her
at
two
or
three
party
,
talk
always
,
as
he
do
so
,
about
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
Laura
,
I
think
your
friend
Mr.
Finn
be
in
love
with
you
,
"
say
Violet
to
Lady
Laura
one
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
.
<EOS>
He
be
fond
of
me
,
and
so
be
I
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
honest
,
and
so
naïve
without
be
awkward
!
<EOS>
and
then
he
be
undoubtedly
clever
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
so
uncommonly
handsome
,
"
say
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
that
make
much
difference
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
do
if
a
man
look
like
a
gentleman
as
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Finn
certainly
look
like
a
gentleman
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
no
doubt
be
one
,
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
he
have
get
any
money
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
a
penny
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
such
a
man
manage
to
live
?
<EOS>
there
be
so
many
man
like
that
,
and
they
be
always
mystery
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
will
have
to
marry
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
whoever
get
him
will
not
have
a
bad
husband
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
  
<EOS>
phinea
during
the
summer
have
very
often
meet
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
They
sit
on
the
same
side
of
the
House
,
they
belong
to
the
same
club
,
they
dine
together
more
than
once
in
Portman
Square
,
and
on
one
occasion
Phineas
have
accept
an
invitation
to
dinner
send
to
him
by
Mr.
Kennedy
himself
.
"
<EOS>
a
slow
affair
I
never
see
in
my
life
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
afterwards
to
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
though
there
be
two
or
three
man
there
who
talk
everywhere
else
,
they
could
not
talk
at
his
table
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
give
you
good
wine
,
I
should
say
,
"
say
Fitzgibbon
,
"
and
let
me
tell
you
that
that
cover
a
multitude
of
sin
.
<EOS>
"
in
spite
,
however
,
of
all
these
opportunity
for
intimacy
,
now
,
nearly
at
the
end
of
the
session
,
Phineas
have
hardly
speak
a
dozen
word
to
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
really
know
nothing
whatsoever
of
the
man
,
as
one
friend
,
 
or
even
as
one
acquaintance
know
another
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
desire
him
to
be
on
good
term
with
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
for
that
reason
he
have
dine
with
him
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
dislike
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
feel
quite
sure
that
Mr.
Kennedy
dislike
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
therefore
rather
surprised
when
he
receive
the
follow
note
:
    
Albany
,
Z
3
,
July
17
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
MR
.
<EOS>
FINN
,
  
<EOS>
I
shall
have
some
friend
at
Loughlinter
next
month
,
and
should
be
very
glad
if
you
will
join
us
.
<EOS>
I
will
name
the
16th
August
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
you
shoot
,
but
there
be
grouse
and
deer
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
truly
,
  
ROBERT
KENNEDY
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
he
to
do
?
<EOS>
He
have
already
begin
to
feel
rather
uncomfortable
at
the
prospect
of
be
separate
from
all
his
new
friend
as
soon
as
the
session
should
be
over
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibhon
have
ask
him
to
make
another
visit
to
county
Mayo
,
but
that
he
have
decline
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
say
something
to
him
about
go
abroad
with
her
brother
,
and
since
that
there
have
spring
up
a
sort
of
intimacy
between
him
and
Lord
Chiltern
;
but
nothing
have
be
fix
about
this
foreign
trip
,
and
there
be
pecuniary
objection
to
it
which
put
it
almost
out
of
his
power
.
<EOS>
the
Christmas
holiday
he
would
of
course
pass
with
his
family
at
Killaloe
,
but
he
hardly
like
the
idea
of
hurry
off
to
Killaloe
immediately
the
session
should
be
over
.
<EOS>
everybody
around
him
seem
to
be
look
forward
to
pleasant
leisure
doing
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
man
talk
about
grouse
,
and
of
the
lady
at
the
house
to
which
they
be
go
and
of
the
people
whom
they
be
to
meet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
say
nothing
of
her
own
movement
for
the
early
autumn
,
and
no
invitation
have
come
to
him
to
go
to
the
Earl
's
country
house
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
feel
that
every
one
would
depart
and
that
he
would
be
leave
,
 
and
this
have
make
him
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
what
be
he
to
do
with
the
invitation
from
Mr.
Kennedy
?
<EOS>
He
dislike
the
man
,
and
have
tell
himself
half
a
dozen
time
that
he
despise
him
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
must
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
even
for
the
sake
of
the
scenery
,
and
the
grouse
,
and
the
pleasant
party
,
and
the
feeling
that
go
to
Loughlinter
in
August
would
be
the
proper
sort
of
thing
to
do
,
he
must
refuse
it
!
<EOS>
but
it
occur
to
him
at
last
that
he
would
call
in
Portman
Square
before
he
write
his
note
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
will
go
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
in
her
most
decide
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
first
place
it
be
civil
in
him
to
ask
you
,
and
why
should
you
be
uncivil
in
return
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
uncivil
in
not
accept
a
man
's
invitation
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
go
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
I
shall
be
disappoint
if
you
do
not
go
too
.
<EOS>
both
Mr.
Gresham
and
Mr.
Monk
will
be
there
,
and
I
believe
they
have
never
stay
together
in
the
same
house
before
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
there
be
a
dozen
man
on
your
side
of
the
House
who
would
give
their
eye
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
will
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
he
do
go
.
<EOS>
the
note
accept
Mr.
Kennedy
's
invitation
be
write
at
the
Reform
Club
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
his
leave
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
careful
in
write
to
be
not
more
familiar
or
more
civil
than
Mr.
Kennedy
have
be
to
himself
,
and
then
he
sign
himself
"
<EOS>
your
truly
,
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
another
proposition
be
make
to
him
,
and
a
most
charming
proposition
,
during
the
few
minute
that
he
remain
in
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
"
because
I
can
now
ask
you
to
run
down
to
us
at
Saulsby
for
a
couple
of
day
on
your
way
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
till
this
be
fix
I
could
not
ask
you
to
come
all
the
way
to
Saulsby
for
two
day
;
and
there
will
not
be
room
for
more
between
our
leave
London
and
start
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
swear
that
he
would
have
go
if
it
have
be
but
for
one
hour
,
and
if
Saulsby
have
be
twice
the
distance
.
"
<EOS>
very
well
;
come
on
the
13th
and
go
on
the
15th
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
on
the
15th
,
unless
you
choose
to
stay
with
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
and
remember
,
Mr.
Finn
,
we
have
get
no
grouse
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
declare
that
he
do
not
care
a
straw
for
grouse
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
another
little
occurrence
which
happen
before
Phineas
leave
London
,
and
which
be
not
altogether
so
charming
as
his
prospect
at
Saulsby
and
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
early
in
August
,
when
the
session
be
still
incomplete
,
he
dine
with
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
at
the
Reform
Club
.
<EOS>
Laurence
have
specially
invite
him
to
do
so
,
and
make
very
much
of
him
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
George
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
Laurence
say
to
him
that
morning
,
"
nothing
have
happen
to
me
this
session
that
have
give
me
so
much
pleasure
as
your
being
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
of
course
there
be
fellow
with
whom
one
be
very
intimate
and
of
whom
one
be
very
fond
,
 
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
but
most
of
these
englishman
on
our
side
be
such
cold
fellow
;
or
else
they
be
like
Ratler
and
Barrington
Erle
,
thinking
of
nothing
but
politic
.
<EOS>
and
then
as
to
our
own
man
,
there
be
so
many
of
them
one
can
hardly
trust
!
<EOS>
that
be
the
truth
of
it
.
<EOS>
Your
being
in
the
House
have
be
such
a
comfort
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
really
like
his
friend
Laurence
,
express
himself
very
warmly
in
answer
to
this
,
and
become
affectionate
,
and
make
sundry
protestation
of
friendship
which
be
perfectly
sincere
.
<EOS>
Their
sincerity
be
test
after
dinner
,
when
Fitzgibbon
,
as
they
two
be
seat
on
a
sofa
in
the
corner
of
the
smoking
-
room
,
ask
Phineas
to
put
his
name
to
the
back
of
a
bill
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
at
six
month
'
date
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
dear
Laurence
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
be
a
sum
of
money
utterly
beyond
my
reach
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exactly
,
my
dear
boy
,
and
that
be
why
I
have
come
to
you
.
<EOS>
d'ye
think
I
would
have
ask
anybody
who
by
any
impossibility
may
have
be
make
to
pay
anything
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
the
use
of
it
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
the
use
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
be
for
me
to
judge
of
the
use
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
why
,
d'ye
think
I
would
ask
it
if
it
be
not
any
use
?
<EOS>
I
will
make
it
of
use
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
and
take
my
word
,
you
will
never
hear
about
it
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
a
forestalling
of
my
salary
;
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
do
it
till
I
see
that
we
be
at
least
safe
for
six
month
to
come
.
"
<EOS>
then
Phineas
Finn
with
many
misgiving
,
with
much
inward
hatred
of
himself
for
his
own
weakness
,
do
put
his
name
on
the
back
of
the
bill
which
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
have
prepare
for
his
signature

"
so
you

"
not
this
autumn

I
should
think
so
too

I
wish

ask
me

I

think
it
as
good

secretaryship

"
  
<EOS>
"
well

the

upon

my

I
know

this
be
your
first
year
,
and
you
be
ask
to
the
two
most
difficult
house
in
England
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
look
out
for
an
heiress
now

there
be
little
Vi
Effingham
;

sure
to
be
at

good
-
bye
,
old
fellow

<EOS>
do
not
you
be
in
the
least
unhappy
about
the
bill
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
to
make
that
all
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
be
rather
unhappy
about
the
bill
;
but
there
be
so
much
that
be
pleasant
in
his
cup
at
the
present
moment
,
that
he
resolve
,
as
far
as
possible
,
to
ignore
the
bitter
of
that
one
ingredient
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
in
the
dark
as
to
two
or
three
matter
respect
these
come
visit
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
like
to
have
take
a
servant
with
him
;
but
he
have
no
servant
,
and
feel
ashamed
to
hire
one
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
be
in
trouble
about
a
gun
,
and
the
paraphernalia
of
shooting
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
bad
shot
at
snipe
in
the
bog
of
county
Clare
,
but
he
have
never
even
see
a
gun
use
in
England
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
buy
himself
a
gun
,
 
with
other
paraphernalia
,
and
take
a
license
for
himself
,
and
then
groan
over
the
expense
to
which
he
find
that
his
journey
would
subject
him
.
<EOS>
and
at
last
he
hire
a
servant
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
be
intensely
ashamed
of
himself
when
he
have
do
so
,
hate
himself
,
and
tell
himself
that
he
be
go
to
the
devil
headlong
.
<EOS>
and
why
have
he
do
it
?
<EOS>
not
that
Lady
Laura
would
like
him
the
well
,
or
that
she
would
care
whether
he
have
a
servant
or
not
.
<EOS>
She
probably
would
know
nothing
of
his
servant
.
<EOS>
but
the
people
about
her
would
know
,
and
he
be
foolishly
anxious
that
the
people
about
her
should
think
that
he
be
worthy
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
call
on
Mr.
Low
before
he
start
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
to
leave
London
without
see
you

he

;

I
know
you
will
have
nothing
pleasant
to
say
to
me

<EOS>
"
I
shall
say
nothing
unpleasant
certainly

I
see
your

I
feel
a
sort
of
envy
myself

Phineas

<EOS>
"
to
tell
you
the

I
have
be
gratify
to

that

the

more
than

<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunce
be
delighted
when

find
that

hire
a

predict
nothing

vain
an

if

<EOS>
Phineas
find
that
the
house
be
full
at
Saulsby

although
the
sojourn
of
the
visitor
would
necessarily
be
so
short
.
<EOS>
there
be
three

four
there
on
their
way
on

I
have
only
one
comfort
;
 
you
will
be

dull

I

if
you
want
to
know
my
real
mind

Violet

I
would
give
one
of
my
little
finger
to
go

<EOS>
there
will
be
four
Cabinet
Ministers
in
the
house
,
and
four
un
-
Cabinet
Ministers
,

half
a
dozen
other
member
of

there
will
be
Lady
Glencora
Palliser

be
the
good
fun
in

,
in
point
of
fact

it
be
the
thing
of
the
year

I
be
not
ask
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
belong
to
the
Baldock
faction
,

we
do
not
sit
on
your
side

House

<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
think
that
I
should
tell
secret

why
on
earth
have
Mr.
Kennedy
invite
him
,
Phineas
Finn
,
to
meet
four
Cabinet
Ministers
and
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
?
<EOS>
He
could
only
have
do
so
at
the
instance
of
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
It
be
delightful
for
Phineas
to
think
that
Lady
Laura
care
for
him
so
deeply
;
but
it
be
not
equally
delightful
when
he
remember
how
very
close
must
be
the
alliance
between
Mr.
Kennedy
and
Lady
Laura
,
when
she
be
thus
powerful
with
him

<EOS>
at
Saulsby
Phineas
do
not

much
of

hostess

when
they
be
make
their
plan
for
the
one
entire
day
of
this
visit
,
she
say
a
soft
word
of
apology
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
busy
with
all
these
people
,
that
I
hardly
know
what
I
be
do

<EOS>

we
shall
be
able
to
find
a
quiet
minute
or
two
at
Loughlinter
,
 
unless
,
indeed
,
you
intend
to
be
on
the
mountain
all
day

I
suppose
you
have
bring
a
gun
like
everybody
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
have
bring
a
gun
.

I
do
shoot
;

I
be
not
an
inveterate
sportsman

<EOS>
on
that
one
day
there
be
a
great
ride
party
make
up
,
and
Phineas
find
himself
mount
,
after
luncheon
,
with
some
dozen
other
equestrian
.
<EOS>
among
them
be
Miss
Effingham

Lady
Glencora

Mr.
Ratler

the
Earl

Brentford
himself

Lady
Glencora

whose
husband
be

as
have
be
say
,
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer

who
be
still
a
young
woman
,

a
very
pretty
woman

have
take
lately
very
strongly
to
politic
,
which
she
discuss
among
man
and
woman
of
both
party
with
something
more
than
ordinary
audacity
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
nice
,
happy
,
lazy
time
you
have
have
of
it
since
you
have
be
in

she
to
the
Earl

"
I
hope
we
have
be
more
happy
than
lazy
,

the
Earl

you
have
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
have
twenty
scheme
of
reform

all
mature
;

among
you
you
have
not
let
him
bring
in
one
of
them

<EOS>
the
Duke
and
Mr.
Mildmay

you
will
break
his
heart
among
you

"
Poor
Mr.

<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
if
you
do
not
take
care
he
and
Mr.
Monk
and
Mr.
Gresham
will
arise
and
shake
themselves
,
and
turn
you
all
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
look
to
ourselves
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
,
yes
;
 
or
you
will
be
know
to
all
posterity
as
the
fainéant
government
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
tell
you
,
Lady
Glencora
,
that
a
fainéant
government
be
not
the
bad
government
that
England
can
have
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
the
great
fault
of
our
politician
that
they
have
all
want
to
do
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Mildmay
be
at
any
rate
innocent
of
that
charge

say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
now
ride
through
a
vast
wood
,

Phineas
find
himself
delightfully
establish
by
the
side
of
Violet
Effingham

<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
have
be
explain
to
me
that
he
must
have
nineteen
next
session

<EOS>
now
,
if
I
be
you
,
Mr.
Finn

I
would
decline

count
up
in
that
way
as
one
of
Mr.
Ratler
's
sheep

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
something
on
your
own
hook

<EOS>
You
man

Parliament
be
so
much
like

<EOS>
if
one
jump
at
a
gap

all
go
after
him

then
you

pen
into
lobby

then
you

feed

then
you

<EOS>
I
wish
I
be
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
would
get
up
in
the
middle
and
make
such
a
speech
.
<EOS>
You
all
seem
to
me
to
be
so
much
afraid
of
one
another
that
you
do
not

dare
to
speak
out

not

his
sister

the
good

I
use

so
much

I
have
not

that
cottage

Miss

one
word
more
about
Lord
Chiltern

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He

so
good

<EOS>
on
the
follow
day
the
party

Saulsby

break
up
,
and
there
be
a
regular
pilgrimage
towards
Loughlinter

<EOS>
Phineas

upon
sleep
a
night
at
Edinburgh
on
his
way
,
and
he
find
himself
join
in
the
band
of
close
companionship
with
Mr.
Ratler
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
evening

away
,
for
he

much
of
his

<EOS>
and
Mr.
Ratler
be
hear
to
declare
afterwards
at
Loughlinter
that
Mr.
Finn
be
a
pleasant
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
It
soon
come
to
be
admit
by
all
who
know
Phineas
Finn
that
he
have
a
peculiar
power
of
make
himself
agreeable
which
no
one
know
how
to
analyse
or
define
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
because
he
listen
so
well
,
"
say
one
man
.
<EOS>
"
but
the
woman
would
not
like
him
for
that

say
another

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
have
study
when
to
listen
and
when
to
talk

"
say
a
third

<EOS>
the
truth
,
however
,
be
,
that
Phineas
Finn
have
make
no
study
in
the
matter
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
be
simply
his
nature
to
be
pleasant
.
   
<EOS>
Loughlinter
 
Phineas

Loughlinter
together
with
Mr.
Ratler
in
a
post

chaise
from
the

<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
,
who
have
do
this
kind
of
thing
very
often
before

travel
without
impediment

but
the
new
servant
of
our
hero

be
stick
outside
with
the

and
be
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
bring
a
man
with
me
,
"
say
Mr.
Ratler
to
his
young
friend
.
<EOS>
"
the
servant
of
the
house
like
it
much
better
,
because
they
get
fee'd
;
you
be
just
as
well
wait
on
,
and
it
do
not
cost
half
as
much
.
"
<EOS>
Phineas
blush
as
he
hear
all
this
;
but
there
be
the
impediment
,
not
to
be
get
rid
of
for
the
nonce
,
and
Phineas
make
the
good
of
his
attendant
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
one
of
those
point
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
as
to
which
a
man
never
quite
make
up
his
mind
.
<EOS>
if
you
bring
a
fellow
,
you
wish
you
have
not
bring
him
;
and
if
you
do
not

you
wish
you
have

"
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
great
deal
more
decide
in
my
way
that
that
,
"
say
Mr.
Ratler
.
  
<EOS>
Loughlinter
,
as
they
approach
it
,
seem
to
Phineas
to
be
a
much
fine
place
than
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
,
except
that
Loughlinter
want
that
graceful
beauty
of
age
which
Saulsby
possess
.
<EOS>
Loughlinter
be
all
of
cut
stone
,
but
the
stone
have
be
cut
only
yesterday
.
<EOS>
It
stand
on
a
gentle
slope
,
with
a
greensward
fall
from
the
front
entrance
down
to
a
mountain
lake
.
<EOS>
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
Lough
there
rise
a
mighty
mountain
to
the
sky
,
Ben
Linter
.
<EOS>
at
the
foot
of
it
,
and
all
round
to
the
left
,
there
run
the
wood
of
Linter
,
stretch
for
mile
through
crag
and
bog
and
mountain
land
.
<EOS>
no
well
ground
for
deer
than
the
side
of
Ben
Linter
be
there
in
all
those
highland
.
<EOS>
and
the
Linter
,
rush
down
into
the
Lough
through
rock
which
,
in
some
place
,
almost
meet
together
above
its
water
,
run
so
near
to
the
house
that
the
pleasant
noise
of
its
cataract
could
be
hear
from
the
hall
door
.
<EOS>
behind
the
house
the
expanse
of
drain
park
land
seem
to
be
interminable
;
and
then
,
again
,
come
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
there
be
Ben
Linn
and
Ben
Lody
;
 
and
the
whole
territory
belong
to
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
He
be
laird
of
Linn
and
laird
of
Linter
,
as
his
people
use
to
say
.
<EOS>
and
yet
his
father
have
walk
into
Glasgow
as
a
little
boy
,
 
no
doubt
with
the
normal
half
-
crown
in
his
breech
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
magnificent
;
 
be
it
not
?
"
say
Phineas
to
the
Treasury
Secretary
,
as
they
be
be
drive
up
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
grand
;
 
but
the
young
tree
show
the
new
man
.
<EOS>
a
new
man
may
buy
a
forest
;
but
he
can
not
get
park
tree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
at
the
moment
,
be
think
how
far
all
these
thing
which
he
see
,
the
mountain
stretch
everywhere
around
him
,
the
castle
,
the
lake
,
the
river
,
the
wealth
of
it
all
,
and
,
more
than
the
wealth
,
the
nobility
of
the
beauty
,
may
act
as
temptation
to
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
if
a
woman
be
ask
to
have
the
half
of
all
this
,
would
it
be
possible
that
she
should
prefer
to
take
the
half
of
his
nothing
?
<EOS>
He
think
it
may
be
possible
for
a
girl
who
would
confess
,
or
seem
to
confess
,
that
love
should
be
everything
.
<EOS>
but
it
could
hardly
be
possible
for
a
woman
who
look
at
the
world
almost
as
a
man
look
at
it
,
 
as
an
oyster
to
be
open
with
such
weapon
as
she
could
find
ready
to
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
profess
to
have
a
care
for
all
the
affair
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
love
politic
,
and
could
talk
of
social
science
,
and
have
broad
idea
about
religion
,
and
be
devoted
to
certain
educational
view
.
<EOS>
such
a
woman
would
feel
that
wealth
be
necessary
to
her
,
and
would
be
willing
,
for
the
sake
of
wealth
,
to
put
up
with
a
husband
without
romance
.
<EOS>
nay
;
may
it
not
be
that
she
would
prefer
a
husband
without
romance
?
<EOS>
thus
Phineas
be
argue
to
himself
as
he
be
drive
up
to
the
door
of
Loughlinter
Castle
,
while
Mr.
Ratler
be
eloquent
on
the
beauty
of
old
park
tree
.
<EOS>
"
after
all
,
a
Scotch
forest
be
a
very
scrubby
sort
of
thing
,
"
say
Mr.
Ratler
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
in
the
house
,
 
at
least
,
they
find
nobody
;
and
within
half
an
hour
Phineas
be
walk
about
the
ground
by
himself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
have
declare
himself
to
be
delighted
at
have
an
opportunity
of
write
letter
,
 
and
<EOS>
no
doubt
be
write
them
by
the
dozen
,
all
date
from
Loughlinter
,
and
all
detail
the
fact
that
Mr.
Gresham
,
and
Mr.
Monk
,
and
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
and
Lord
Brentford
be
in
the
same
house
with
him
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
no
letter
to
write
,
and
therefore
rush
down
across
the
broad
lawn
to
the
river
,
of
which
he
hear
the
noisy
tumbling
water
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
air
which
immediately
fill
him
with
high
spirit
;
and
,
in
his
desire
to
investigate
the
glory
of
the
place
,
he
forget
that
he
be
go
to
dine
with
four
Cabinet
Ministers
in
a
row
.
<EOS>
He
soon
reach
the
stream
,
and
begin
to
make
his
way
up
it
through
the
ravine
.
<EOS>
there
be
waterfall
over
waterfall
,
and
there
be
little
bridge
here
and
there
which
look
to
be
half
natural
and
half
artificial
,
and
a
path
which
require
that
you
should
climb
,
but
which
be
yet
a
path
,
and
all
be
so
arrange
that
not
a
pleasant
splash
rush
of
the
water
be
lose
to
the
visitor
.
<EOS>
He
go
on
and
on
,
up
the
stream
,
till
there
be
a
sharp
turn
in
the
ravine
,
and
then
,
look
upwards
,
he
see
above
his
head
a
man
and
a
woman
stand
together
on
one
of
the
little
half
-
make
wooden
bridge
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
sharp
,
and
he
see
at
a
glance
that
the
woman
be
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
recognise
the
man
,
but
he
have
very
little
doubt
that
it
be
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
Mr.
Kennedy
,
because
he
would
prefer
that
it
should
be
any
other
man
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
turn
back
at
once
if
he
have
think
that
he
could
have
do
so
without
be
observe
;
but
he
feel
sure
that
,
stand
as
they
be
,
they
must
have
observe
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
like
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
intrude
himself
.
<EOS>
so
he
remain
still
,
and
begin
to
throw
stone
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
throw
above
a
stone
or
two
when
he
be
call
from
above
.
<EOS>
He
look
up
,
and
then
he
perceive
that
the
man
who
call
him
be
his
host
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
thereupon
he
cease
to
throw
stone
,
and
go
up
the
path
,
and
join
them
upon
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
step
forward
,
and
bade
him
welcome
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
His
manner
be
less
cold
,
and
he
seem
to
have
more
word
at
command
than
be
usual
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
be
long
,
"
he
say
,
"
in
find
out
the
most
beautiful
spot
about
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
not
lovely
?
"
say
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
be
here
an
hour
yet
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
insist
on
bring
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
wonderfully
beautiful
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
this
very
spot
where
we
now
stand
that
make
me
build
the
house
where
it
be
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
and
I
be
only
eighteen
when
I
stand
here
and
make
up
my
mind
.
<EOS>
that
be
just
twenty
-
five
year
ago
.
"
<EOS>
"
so
he
be
forty
-
three
,
"
say
Phineas
to
himself
,
think
how
glorious
it
be
to
be
only
twenty
-
five
.
"
<EOS>
and
within
twelve
month
,
"
continue
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
the
foundation
be
be
dig
and
the
stone
-
cutter
be
at
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
good
-
natured
man
your
father
must
have
be
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
nothing
else
to
do
with
his
money
but
to
pour
it
over
my
head
,
as
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
he
have
any
other
enjoyment
of
it
himself
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go
a
little
high
,
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
We
shall
get
a
fine
view
over
to
Ben
Linn
just
now
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
declare
that
she
would
go
as
much
high
as
he
choose
to
take
her
,
and
Phineas
be
rather
in
doubt
as
to
what
it
would
become
him
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
would
stay
where
he
be
,
or
go
down
,
or
make
himself
to
vanish
after
any
most
acceptable
fashion
;
but
if
he
be
to
do
so
abruptly
it
would
seem
as
though
he
be
attribute
something
special
to
the
companionship
of
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
see
his
doubt
,
and
ask
him
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
as
well
come
on
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
dine
till
eight
,
and
it
be
not
much
past
six
yet
.
<EOS>
the
man
of
business
be
all
write
letter
,
and
the
lady
who
have
be
travel
be
in
bed
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
all
of
them
,
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
then
they
go
on
with
their
walk
very
pleasantly
,
and
the
lord
of
all
that
they
survey
take
them
from
one
point
of
vantage
to
another
,
till
they
both
swear
that
of
all
spot
upon
the
earth
<EOS>
Loughlinter
be
surely
the
most
lovely
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
delight
in
it
,
I
own
,
"
say
the
lord
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
come
up
here
alone
,
and
feel
that
in
the
midst
of
this
little
bit
of
a
crowded
island
I
have
all
this
to
myself
,
 
all
this
with
which
no
other
man
's
wealth
can
interfere
,
 
I
grow
proud
of
my
own
,
till
I
become
thoroughly
ashamed
of
myself
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
believe
it
be
well
to
dwell
in
city
than
in
the
country
,
 
better
,
at
any
rate
,
for
a
rich
man
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
have
now
speak
more
word
than
Phineas
have
hear
to
fall
from
his
lip
during
the
whole
time
that
they
have
be
acquaint
with
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
too
,
"
say
Laura
,
"
if
one
be
oblige
to
choose
between
the
two

<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
think
that
a
little
of
both
be
good
for
man
and
woman

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
doubt
about
that
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
as
far
as
enjoyment
go
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
them
up
out
of
the
ravine
on
to
the
side
of
the
mountain
,
and
then
down
by
another
path
through
the
wood
to
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
as
they
go
he
relapse
into
his
usual
silence
,
and
the
conversation
be
keep
up
between
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
at
a
point
not
very
far
from
the
castle
,
 
just
so
far
that
one
could
see
by
the
break
of
the
ground
where
the
castle
stand
,
Kennedy
leave
them
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
will
take
you
back
in
safety
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
,
as
I
be
here
,
I
will
go
up
to
the
farm
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
show
myself
now
and
again
when
I
be
here
,
they
think
I
be
indifferent
about
the

bestial
'

<EOS>
"
  
"
now
,
Mr.
Kennedy

"
say
Lady
Laura
,
"
you
be
go
to
pretend
to

all
about
sheep

oxen

<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy

own
that
it
be
so
,
go
away
to
his
farm
,
and
Phineas
with
Lady
Laura
return
towards
the
house

Phineas

as

consider
deeply
all
that
Lady

have
say
to
him

not
so
much
with
reference
to
the
advice

she
have
give

that
also
be
of
importance

as
to
the
fact
that
it
have
be
give
by
her

She
have
first
call
herself
his
Mentor

he
have
accept
the
name

have
address
her

her
Telemachus

he
believe
himself
to
be
old
than
she
,

,
indeed
,
there
be
any
difference
in
their
age

be
it
possible
that
a
female
mentor
should
love
her
<EOS>
Telemachus

should
love
him

Phineas
desire
to
be
love
by
Lady

<EOS>
He
would
not
say
that
it
be
impossible

<EOS>
perhaps
there
have
be
mistake
between
them
;
 
a
mistake
in
his
manner
of
address
her
,

another
in
her
of
address
him

perhaps
the
old
bachelor

have

in

would
he

allow
her
to
walk
home
alone
with
Phineas
,
leave
her
with
some
flimsy
pretext
of
have
to
look
at
his
sheep

Phineas
resolve
that

must
at

play
out
his
game

whether
he
be
to
lose
it

to
win
it

in
play
it
he
must
,
if
possible
,
drop
something
of
that
Mentor

Telemachus
style
of
conversation

<EOS>
as
to
the
advice
give
him
of
herd
with
Greshams

Pallisers

instead
of
with

must
use
that
as
circumstance
may
direct
.

to
him

himself

it
all

him
among

of
themselves

large

more

there
be
a
certain
stiffness
in
the
movement

thing

perhaps
in
the
manner
of
some
of
those
present

which
be
not
feel
at
Saulsby

phinea
at
once
miss
the
grace

prettiness

cheery
audacity
of
Violet
Effingham

at
the

Effingham
would
be
out
of
her
element
at
Loughlinter

<EOS>
at
Loughlinter
they
be
meet
for
business
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
least
a
semi
-
political
,
or
perhaps
rather
a
semi
-
official
gathering
,

he
become
aware
that
he
ought
not
to
look
simply
for
amusement

for
himself

could
see

answer

Mr.

fast

furious

week
pass
by
at

at
the
end

which
Phineas
find
himself
on
term
of
friendly
intercourse
with
all
the
political
magnate
assemble
in
the
house

especially
with
Mr.
Monk

<EOS>
He
have
determine
that
he
would
not
follow
Lady
Laura
's
advice
as
to
his
selection
of
companion

if
in
do
so
he
should
be
drive
even
to
a
seeming
of
intrusion
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
attempt
to
sit
at
the
foot
of
anybody
,
and
would
stand
aloof
when
big
man
than
himself
be
talk
,
and
be
content
to
be
less
,
 
as
indeed
he
be
less
,
 
than
Mr.

at
the
end

week
he
find
that
,
without
any
effort
on
his
part

almost
in
opposition
to
effort
on
his
part

he
have
fall
into
an
easy
pleasant
way
with
these
man
which
be
very
delightful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
kill
a
stag
in
company
with
Mr.

have
stop
beneath
a
crag
to
discuss
with
him
a
question
as
to
the
duty
on
irish
malt
.

He
have
play
chess
with
Mr.

have
be
tell
that
gentleman

opinion
on
the
trial
of
Mr.
Jefferson
Davis
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
have
 
at
last
 
call
him
Finn
,
and
have
prove
to
him
that
nothing
be
know
in
Ireland
about
sheep
.
<EOS>
but
with
Mr.
Monk
he
have
have
long
discussion
on
abstract
question
in
politic
,
 
and
before
the
week
be
over
be
almost
disposed
to
call
himself
a
disciple
,

,
at

,
a
follower
of
Mr.

why
not
of
Mr.

well

else

Mr.

be
in
the
Cabinet

of
all
the
member
of
the
Cabinet
be
the
most
advanced
Liberal

<EOS>
Lady

be
not
so
far
wrong
the
other
night

Mr.

to
him

equality
be
an
ugly
word

should
not

It
mislead

frighten

be
a
bugbear

,
in
use
it

have
not
perhaps
a
clearly
define
meaning
for
it
in
her
own
mind

the
wish

every
honest
man
should
be
to
assist
in
lift
up
those
below
him

they
be
something
near
his
own
level
than
he
find
them
.
"
<EOS>
to
this
Phineas
assent
,
 
and
by
degree
he
find
himself
assent
to
a
great
many
thing
that
Mr.
Monk
say
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
be
a
thin
,
tall
,
gaunt
man
,
who
have
devote
his
whole
life
to
politic
,
hitherto
without
any
personal
reward
beyond
that
which
come
to
him
from
the
reputation
of
his
name
,
and
from
the
honour
of
a
seat
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
four
or
five
brother
,
 
and
all
besides
him
be
in
trade
.
<EOS>
They
have
prosper
in
trade
,
whereas
he
have
prosper
solely
in
politic
;
and
man
say
that
he
be
dependent
altogether
on
what
his
relative
supply
for
his
support
.
<EOS>
He
have
now

in
Parliament
for
more
than
twenty
year
,
and
have
be
know
not
only
as
a
Radical
but
as
a
Democrat
.
<EOS>
ten
year
since
,
when
he
have
rise
to
fame
,
but
not
to
repute
,
among
the
man
who
then
govern
England
,
nobody
dream
that
Joshua
Monk
would
ever
be
a
pay
servant
of
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
He
have
inveigh
against
one
minister
after
another
as
though
they
all
deserve
impeachment
.
<EOS>
He
have
advocate
political
doctrine
which
at
that
time
seem
to
be
altogether
at
variance
with
any
possibility
of
govern
accord
to
english
rule
of
government
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
regard
as
a
pestilent
thorn
in
the
side
of
all
minister
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
be
a
member
of
the
Cabinet
,
and
those
whom
he
have
terrify
in
the
old
day
begin
to
find
that
he
be
not
so
much
unlike
other
man
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
few
horse
which
you
can
not
put
into
harness
,
and
those
of
the
high
spirit
will
generally
do
your
work
the
good

<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
have
his
eye
about
him
,
think
that
he
could
perceive
that
Mr.
Palliser
do
not
shoot
a
deer
with
Mr.
Ratler
,
and
that
Mr.
Gresham
play
no
chess
with
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
Bonteen
,
indeed
,
be
a
noisy
pushing
man
whom
nobody
seem
to
like
,
and
Phineas
wonder
why
he
should
be
at
Loughlinter
,
and
why
he
should
be
in
office
.
<EOS>
His
friend
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
have
indeed
once
endeavour
to
explain
this
.
"
<EOS>
a
man
who
can
vote
hard
,
as
I
call
it
;
and
who
will
speak
a
few
word
now
and
then
as
they
be
want
,
without
any
ambition
that
way
,
may
always
have
his
price
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
have
a
pretty
wife
into
the
bargain
,
he
ought
to
have
a
pleasant
time
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
no
doubt
be
a
very
useful
man
,
who
thoroughly
know
his
business
;
but
yet
,
as
it
seem
to
Phineas
,
no
very
great
distinction
be
show
to
Mr.
Ratler
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
get
as
high
as
that
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
I
should
think
myself
a
miracle
of
luck
.
<EOS>
and
yet
nobody
seem
to
think
anything
of
Ratler
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
nothing
unless
one
can
go
to
the
very
top
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
do
right
to
accept
office
,
"
Mr.
Monk
say
to
him
one
day
,
as
they
sit
together
on
a
rock
close
by
one
of
the
little
bridge
over
the
Linter
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
unless
a
man
do
so
when
the
bond
of
the
office
tender
to
him
be
make
compatible
with
his
own
view
,
he
decline
to
proceed
on
the
open
path
towards
the
prosecution
of
those
view
.
<EOS>
a
man
who
be
combat
one
ministry
after
another
,
and
strive
to
imbue
those
minister
with
his
conviction
,
can
hardly
decline
to
become
a
minister
himself
when
he
find
that
those
conviction
of
his
own
be
henceforth
,
 
or
at
least
for
some
time
to
come
,
 
to
be
the
ministerial
conviction
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
do
you
follow
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
clearly
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
deny
your
own
child
have
you
refuse

indeed
a
man
be
to
feel
that
he
be
in
some
way
unfitted
for
office
work
.
<EOS>
I
very
nearly
provide
for
myself
an
escape
on
that
plea
;
 
but
when
I
come
to
sift
it
,
I
think
that
it
would
be
false
.
<EOS>
but
let
me
tell
you
that
the
delight
of
political
life
be
altogether
in
opposition
.
<EOS>
why
,
it
be
freedom
against
slavery
,
fire
against
clay
,
movement
against
stagnation
!
<EOS>
the
very
inaccuracy
which
be
permit
to
opposition
be
in
itself
a
charm
worth
more
than
all
the
patronage
and
all
the
prestige
of
ministerial
power
.
<EOS>
You
will
try
them
both
,
and
then
say
if
you
do
not
agree
with
me
.
<EOS>
give
me
the
full
swing
of
the
bench
below
the
gangway
,
where
I
need
to
care
for
no
one
,
and
could
always
enjoy
myself
on
my
leg
as
long
as
I
feel
that
I
be
true
to
those
who
send
me
there
!
<EOS>
that
be
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
They
have
get
me
into
harness
,
and
my
shoulder
be
sore

<EOS>
the
oats
,
however
,
be
of
the
good

the
hay
be
unexceptionable

open

he

also
to

He

come

ten

that
then

little

up

he
make
up
his

to
tell

the
truth

He

<EOS>
there
be
a
melancholy
tone
about
his

he

this

which
make
her
think
for
the
moment
whether

no

be
right
in
go
into
Parliament

and
whether
she
have
be
right
in
instigate
him
to
do
so

it
be
too
late
to
recur
to
that
question
now

yes

it

and
Lady
Glencora
and
I
stand
pretty
much
on
the

footing
,
in
spite
of
all
her
wealth
,
 
except
that
she
be
a
married
woman

<EOS>
I
do
not

something
not

I
be
worth

just
what
papa
choose

give
me

<EOS>
a
ten
-
pound
note
at
the
present
moment
I
should
look
upon
as
great
rich
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
first
time
she
have
ever
speak
to
him
of
her
own
position
as
regard
money
;
but
he
have
hear
,
or
think
that
he
have
hear
,
that
she
have
be
leave
a
fortune
altogether
independent
of
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
of
the
ten
day
have
now
come
,
and
Phineas
be
discontent
and
almost
unhappy
.
<EOS>
the
more
he
see
of
Lady
Laura
the
more
he
fear
that
it
be
impossible
that
she
should
become
his
wife
.
<EOS>
and
yet
from
day
to
day
his
intimacy
with
her
become
more
close
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
make
love
to
her
,
nor
could
he
discover
that
it
be
possible
for
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
be
a
woman
for
whom
all
the
ordinary
stage
of
love
-
make
be
quite
unsuitable
,
of
course
he
could
declare
his
love
and
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
on
any
occasion
on
which
he
may
find
himself
to
be
alone
with
her
.
<EOS>
and
on
this
morning
he
have
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
do
so
before
the
day
be
over
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
possible
that
she
would
never
speak
to
him
again
;
 
that
all
the
pleasure
and
ambitious
hope
to
which
she
have
introduce
him
may
be
over
as
soon
as
that
rash
word
should
have
be
speak
!
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
would
speak
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
day
there
be
to
be
a
grouse
-
shoot
party
,
and
the
shooter
be
to
be
out
early

<EOS>
It
have
be
talk
of
for
some
day
or
two
past
,
and
Phineas
know
that
he
could
not
escape
it
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
some
rivalry
between
him
and
Mr.
Bonteen
,
and
there
be
to
be
a
sort
of
match
as
to
which
of
the
two
would
kill
most
bird
before
lunch
.
<EOS>
but
there
have
also
be
some
half
promise
on
Lady
Laura
's
part
that
she
would
walk
with
him
up
the
linter
and
come
down
upon
the
lake
,
take
an
opposite
direction
from
that
by
which
they
have
return
with
Mr.

"
but
you
will
be
shoot
all
day

she
say
,
when
he
propose
it
to
her
as
they
be
start
for
the
moor
.
<EOS>
the
waggonet
that
be
to
take
them
be
at
the
door

be
there
to
see
them
start

shooting
party

be
another

to
be
back
in
time

be
here

can

go
so
far

I
will
get
back
somehow

Phineas

be
resolve
that
a
few
mile
more
or
less
of
mountain
should
not
detain
him
from
the
prosecution
of
a
task
so
vitally
important
to
him

"
if
we
start
at
five
that
will

early
enough

"
quite
early
enough

Laura

off
to

mountain

grouse

match

eat
his
luncheon

Mr.
Bonteen

however

be
not
beat
by
much
,

be
in
consequence
somewhat
ill

humour

"

will
tell
you
what
I
will
do

Mr.
Bonteen

"
I
will
back
myself
for
the
rest
of
the
day
for
a
ten
-
pound
note

"
  
<EOS>
now
there
have
be
no
money
stake
on
the
match
at
all
,
 
but
it
have
be
simply
a
trial
of
skill
,
as
to
which
would
kill
the
most
bird
in
a
give
time
.
<EOS>
and
the
proposition
for
that
trial
have
come
from
Mr.
Bonteen
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
think
of
shoot
for
money
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
why
not
?
<EOS>
a
bet
be
the
only
way
to
decide
these
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
partly
because
I
be
sure
I
should
not
hit
a
bird
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
and
partly
because
I
have
not
get
any
money
to
lose
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
bet
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
to
him
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
annoy
when
Bonteen
offer
the
wager
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
,
however
,
you
would
not
accept
it
.

I
suppose
such
bet
be
very
common

I
do
not
think
man
ought
to
propose
them
unless
they
be
quite
sure
of
their
company

maybe
I
be
wrong
,
and
I
often
feel
that
I
be
strait
-
lace
about
such
thing
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
odd
to
me
that
man
can
not
amuse
themselves
without
pit
themselves
against
each
other
.
<EOS>
when
a
man
tell
me
that
he
can
shoot
better
than
I
,
I
tell
him
that
my
keeper
can
shoot
better
than
he

all
the

it
be

seven
out
of
the
nine
mile
,
would
be
along
a
high
road
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
do
it
all
the
same
,
"
say
he
,
prepare
for
a
start
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
engagement
with
Lady
Laura
Standish
;
and
as
this
be
the
last
day
that
I
shall
see
her
,
I
certainly
do
not
mean
to
break
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
an
engagement
with
Lady
Laura
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
not
tell
me
,
that
I
may
have
a
pony
ready
?
<EOS>
but
come
along
.
<EOS>
Donald
Bean
have
a
pony
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
much
big
than
a
dog
,
but
he
will
carry
you
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
walk
it
,
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
think
of
the
state
in
which
you
would
reach
Loughlinter
!
<EOS>
come
along
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
take
you
off
the
mountain
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
must
allow
me
to
take
you
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
Mr.
Kennedy
lead
the
way
down
to
Donald
Bean
's
cottage
,
and
before
three
o'clock
Phineas
find
himself
mount
on
a
shaggy
steed
,
which
,
in
sober
truth
,
be
not
much
big
than
a
large
dog
.
<EOS>
"
if
Mr.
Kennedy
be
really
my
rival
,
"
say
Phineas
to
himself
,
as
he
trot
along
,
"
I
almost
think
that
I
be
do
an
unhandsome
thing
in
take
the
pony
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
five
o'clock
he
be
under
the
portico
before
the
front
door
,
and
there
he
find
Lady
Laura
wait
for
him
,
 
wait
for
him
,
or
at
least
ready
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
on
her
hat
and
glove
and
light
shawl
,
and
her
parasol
be
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
he
have
never
see
her
look
so
young
,
so
pretty
,
and
so
fit
to
receive
a
lover
's
vow
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
same
moment
it
occur
to
him
that
she
be
Lady
Laura
Standish
,
the
daughter
of
an
Earl
,
the
descendant
of
a
line
of
Earls
,
 
and
that
he
be
the
son
of
a
simple
country
doctor
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
be
it
fitting
that
he
should
ask
such
a
woman
to
be
his
wife
?
<EOS>
but
then
Mr.
Kennedy
be
the
son
of
a
man
who
have
walk
into
Glasgow
with
half
-
a
-
crown
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
's
grandfather
have
be
,
 
<EOS>
Phineas
think
that
he
have
hear
that
Mr.
Kennedy
's
grandfather
have
be
a
Scotch
drover
;
whereas
his
own
grandfather
have
be
a
little
squire
near
Ennistimon
,
in
county
Clare
,
and
his
own
first
cousin
once
remove
still
hold
the
paternal
acre
at
Finn
Grove
.
<EOS>
His
family
be
suppose
to
be
descend
from
king
in
that
part
of
Ireland
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
do
not
become
him
to
fear
Lady
Laura
on
the
score
of
rank
,
if
it
be
to
be
allow
to
Mr.
Kennedy
to
proceed
without
fear
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
as
to
wealth
,
Lady
Laura
have
already
tell
him
that
her
fortune
be
no
great
than
his
.
<EOS>
Her
statement
to
himself
on
that
head
make
him
feel
that
he
should
not
hesitate
on
the
score
of
money
.
<EOS>
They
neither
have
any
,
and
he
be
willing
to
work
for
both
.
<EOS>
if
she
fear
the
risk
,
let
her
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
he
argue
with
himself
;
but
yet
he
know
,
 
know
as
well
as
the
reader
will
know
,
 
that
he
be
go
to
do
that
which
he
have
no
right
to
do
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
very
well
for
him
to
wait
,
 
presume
him
to
be
successful
in
his
love
,
 
for
the
opening
of
that
oyster
with
his
political
sword
,
that
oyster
on
which
he
propose
that
they
should
both
live
;
but
such
waiting
could
not
well
be
to
the
taste
of
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
It
could
hardly
be
pleasant
to
her
to
look
forward
to
his
be
make
a
junior
lord
or
an
assistant
secretary
before
she
could
establish
herself
in
her
home
.
<EOS>
so
he
tell
himself
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
tell
himself
at
the
same
time
that
it
be
incumbent
on
him
to
persevere
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
expect
you
in
the
least
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
yet
I
speak
very
positively
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
thing
as
to
which
a
man
may
be
very
positive
,
and
yet
may
be
allow
to
fail
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
how
on
earth
do
you
get
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
get
me
a
pony
,
 
Donald
Bean
's
pony
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
tell
him
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
tell
him
why
I
be
come
,
and
that
I
must
be
here
.
<EOS>
then
he
take
the
trouble
to
come
all
the
way
off
the
mountain
to
persuade
Donald
to
lend
me
his
pony
.
<EOS>
I
must
acknowledge
that
Mr.
Kennedy
have
conquer
me
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
of
that
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
would
,
 
unless
it
be
your
own
fault
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
go
up
the
path
by
the
brook
,
from
bridge
to
bridge
,
till
they
find
themselves
out
upon
the
open
mountain
at
the
top
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
resolve
that
he
would
not
speak
out
his
mind
till
he
find
himself
on
that
spot
;
that
then
he
would
ask
her
to
sit
down
,
and
that
while
she
be
so
seated
he
would
tell
her
everything
.
<EOS>
at
the
present
moment
he
have
on
his
head
a
Scotch
cap
with
a
grouse
's
feather
in
it
,
and
he
be
dress
in
a
velvet
shooting
-
jacket
and
dark
knickerbocker
;
and
be
certainly
,
in
this
costume
,
as
handsome
a
man
as
any
woman
would
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
,
too
,
a
look
of
breed
about
him
which
have
come
to
him
,
no
doubt
,
from
the
royal
Finns
of
old
,
which
ever
serve
him
in
great
stead
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
only
Phineas
Finn
,
and
be
know
by
the
world
to
be
no
more
;
but
he
look
as
though
he
may
have
be
anybody
,
 
a
royal
Finn
himself
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
have
that
special
grace
of
appear
to
be
altogether
unconscious
of
his
own
personal
advantage
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
that
in
truth
he
be
barely
conscious
of
them
;
that
he
depend
on
them
very
little
,
if
at
all
;
that
there
be
nothing
of
personal
vanity
in
his
composition
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
indulge
in
any
hope
that
Lady
Laura
would
accept
him
because
he
be
a
handsome
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
all
that
climbing
,
"
he
say
,
"
will
you
not
sit
down
for
a
moment
?
"
<EOS>
as
he
speak
to
her
she
look
at
him
and
tell
herself
that
he
be
as
handsome
as
a
god
.
<EOS>
"
do
sit
down
for
one
moment
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
that
I
desire
to
say
to
you
,
and
to
say
it
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
she
say
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
also
have
something
to
tell
you
,
and
will
say
it
while
I
be
yet
stand
.
<EOS>
yesterday
I
accept
an
offer
of
marriage
from
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
be
too
late
,
"
say
Phineas
,
and
put
his
hand
into
the
pocket
of
his
coat
,
he
turn
his
back
upon
her
,
and
walk
away
across
the
mountain
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
fool
he
have
be
to
let
her
know
his
secret
when
her
knowledge
of
it
could
be
of
no
service
to
him
,
 
when
her
knowledge
of
it
could
only
make
him
appear
foolish
in
her
eye
!
<EOS>
but
for
his
life
he
could
not
have
keep
his
secret
to
himself
.
<EOS>
nor
now
could
he
bring
himself
to
utter
a
word
of
even
decent
civility
.
<EOS>
but
he
go
on
walk
as
though
he
could
thus
leave
her
there
,
and
never
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
what
an
ass
he
have
be
in
supposing
that
she
care
for
him
!
<EOS>
what
a
fool
to
imagine
that
his
poverty
could
stand
a
chance
against
the
wealth
of
Loughlinter
!
<EOS>
but
why
have
she
lure
him
on
?
<EOS>
how
he
wish
that
he
be
now
grind
,
hard
at
work
in
Mr.
Low
's
chamber
,
or
sit
at
home
at
Killaloe
with
the
hand
of
that
pretty
little
irish
girl
within
his
own
!
  
<EOS>
presently
he
hear
a
voice
behind
him
,
 
call
him
gently
.
<EOS>
then
he
turn
and
find
that
she
be
very
near
him
.
<EOS>
He
himself
have
then
be
stand
still
for
some
moment
,
and
she
have
follow
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
yes
:
what
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
and
turn
round
he
make
an
attempt
to
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
not
wish
me
joy
,

say
a
word
of
congratulation

Should
I

how
can
I
answer
such
a
question
,
Mr.
Finn

<EOS>

,
rather
,
I
will

answer
it
fully

<EOS>
It
be
not
a
week
since
we
tell
each
other
,
you
to
me

I
to
you
,
that
we
be
both
poor
,
 
both
without
other
mean
than
those
which
come
to
us
from
our
father

<EOS>
You
will
make
your
way
;
 
will
make
it
surely
;

how
at
present
could
you
marry
any
woman

she
have
money
of
her
own

for
me

like
so
many
other

it
be
necessary
that
I
should
stay
at
home

marry
some
one
rich
enough
to
dispense
with
fortune
in
a
wife

the
good

it
wise

listen
a

remember
that
what

no

know
it

my
father

early
in
the
spring
I
pay
my
brother

debt

His
affection
to
me
be
more
than
a
return
for
what
I
have
do
for
him

but
when
I
do
this
,
 
when
I
make
up
my
mind
to
do
it

I
make
up
my
mind
also
that

not
allow
myself
the

freedom
of
choice

<EOS>
Phineas
have
now
seat
himself
on
the
exact
stone
on
which
he
have
wish
her
to
sit
when
he
propose
to
tell
his
own
story
,
and
be
look
forth
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
that
everything
have
be
change
for
him
while
he
have
be
up
there
upon
the
mountain
,
and
that
the
change
have
be
marvellous
in
its
nature
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
be
come
up
,
there
have
be
apparently
two
alternative
before
him
:
the
glory
of
successful
love
,
 
which
,
indeed
,
have
seem
to
him
to
be
a
most
improbable
result
of
the
coming
interview
,
 
and
the
despair
and
utter
banishment
attendant
on
disdainful
rejection
.
<EOS>
but
his
position
be
far
remove
from
either
of
these
alternative
.
<EOS>
She
have
almost
tell
him
that
she
would
have
love
him
<EOS>
have
she
not
be
poor
,
 
that
she
be
begin
to
love
him
and
have
quench
her
love
,
because
it
have
become
impossible
to
her
to
marry
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
in
such
circumstance
he
could
not
be
angry
with
her
,
 
he
could
not
quarrel
with
her
;
he
could
not
do
other
than
swear
to
himself
that
he
would
be
her
friend

yet
he
love
her
well
than
ever

<EOS>
what
murmuring
word
she
speak
to
express
her
refusal
of
such
a
request

I
will
not
quote
;
but
the
kiss
have
be
take
before

denial

complete

there

<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
be
be
carry
away
to
the
railway
station
,
could
not
keep
himself
from
speculate
as
to
how
much
Kennedy
know
of
what
have
take
place
during
the
walk
up
the
Linter
.
<EOS>
of
one
small
circumstance
that
have
occur
,
he
feel
quite
sure
that
Mr.
Kennedy
know
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
return
to
Killaloe
 
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
's
first
session
of
Parliament
be
over
,
 
his
first
session
with
all
its
adventure
.
<EOS>
when
he
get
back
to
Mrs.
Bunce
's
house
,
 
for
Mrs.
Bunce
receive
him
for
a
night
in
spite
of
her
husband
's
advice
to
the
contrary
,
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
he
almost
feel
that
Mrs.
Bunce
and
her
room
be
beneath
him
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
be
very
unhappy
,
 
as
wretched
as
a
man
can
be
;
there
be
moment
in
which
he
think
that
it
would
hardly
become
him
to
live
unless
he
could
do
something
to
prevent
the
marriage
of
Lady
Laura
and
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
have
his
consolation
.
<EOS>
these
be
reflection
which
have
in
them
much
of
melancholy
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
despise
by
the
woman
to
whom
he
have
tell
his
love
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
show
him
that
she
think
him
to
be
unworthy
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
regard
his
love
as
an
offence
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
have
almost
tell
him
that
prudence
alone
have
forbid
her
to
return
his
passion
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
kiss
her
,
and
have
afterwards
part
from
her
as
a
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
there
should
have
be
a
flavour
of
exquisite
joy
in
the
midst
of
his
agony
as
he
think
of
this
;
 
but
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
He
would
never
kiss
her
again
.
<EOS>
all
future
delight
of
that
kind
would
belong
to
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
he
have
no
real
idea
of
interfere
with
that
gentleman
in
the
fruition
of
his
privilege
.
<EOS>
but
still
there
be
the
kiss
,
 
an
eternal
fact
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
in
all
respect
except
that
of
his
love
,
his
visit
to
Loughlinter
have
be
pre
-
eminently
successful
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
have
become
his
friend
,
and
have
encourage
him
to
speak
during
the
next
session
,
 
set
before
him
various
model
,
and
prescribe
for
him
a
course
of
read
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
have
become
intimate
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
on
pleasant
term
with
Mr.
Palliser
and
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
Mr.
Kennedy
,
 
he
and
Mr.
Kennedy
be
almost
bosom
friend
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
that
he
have
quite
surpass
the
Ratlers
,
Fitzgibbons
,
and
Bonteens
in
that
politico
-
social
success
which
go
so
far
towards
downright
political
success
,
and
which
in
itself
be
so
pleasant
.
<EOS>
He
have
surpass
these
man
in
spite
of
their
office
and
their
acquire
position
,
and
could
not
but
think
that
even
Mr.
Low
,
if
he
know
it
all
,
would
confess
that
he
have
be
right
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
his
bosom
friendship
with
Mr.
Kennedy
,
that
of
course
trouble
him
.
<EOS>
Ought
he
not
to
be
drive
a
poniard
into
Mr.
Kennedy
's
heart
?
<EOS>
the
convention
of
life
forbid
that
;
and
therefore
the
bosom
friendship
be
to
be
excuse
.
<EOS>
if
not
an
enemy
to
the
death
,
then
there
could
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
be
a
bosom
friend
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
over
to
Ireland
,
stay
but
one
night
with
Mrs.
Bunce
,
and
come
down
upon
them
at
Killaloe
like
a
god
out
of
the
heaven
.
<EOS>
even
his
father
be
well
-
nigh
overwhelm
by
admiration
,
and
his
mother
and
sister
think
themselves
only
fit
to
minister
to
his
pleasure
.
<EOS>
He
have
learn
,
if
he
have
learn
nothing
else
,
to
look
as
though
he
be
master
of
the
circumstance
around
him
,
and
be
entirely
free
from
internal
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
when
his
father
speak
to
him
about
his
legal
study
,
he
do
not
exactly
laugh
at
his
father
's
ignorance
,
but
he
recapitulate
to
his
father
so
much
of
Mr.
Monk
's
wisdom
at
second
hand
,
 
show
plainly
that
it
be
his
business
to
study
the
art
of
speech
and
the
technicality
of
the
House
,
and
not
to
study
law
,
 
that
his
father
have
nothing
further
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
have
become
a
man
of
such
dimension
that
an
ordinary
father
could
hardly
dare
to
inquire
into
his
proceeding
;
and
as
for
an
ordinary
mother
,
 
such
as
Mrs.
Finn
certainly
be
,
 
she
could
do
no
more
than
look
after
her
son
's
linen
with
awe
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
Flood
Jones
,
 
the
reader
I
hope
will
not
quite
have
forget
Mary
Flood
Jones
,
 
be
in
a
great
tremor
when
first
she
meet
the
hero
of
Loughshane
after
return
from
the
honour
of
his
first
session
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
somewhat
disappointed
because
the
newspaper
have
not
be
full
of
the
speech
he
have
make
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
the
lady
of
the
Finn
household
have
all
be
ill
at
ease
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
imagine
why
Phineas
have
restrain
himself
with
so
much
philosophy
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Flood
Jones
in
discuss
the
matter
with
the
Miss
Finns
have
never
express
the
slight
doubt
of
his
capacity
or
his
judgment
.
<EOS>
and
when
tiding
come
,
 
the
tiding
come
in
a
letter
from
Phineas
to
his
father
,
 
that
he
do
not
intend
to
speak
that
session
,
because
speech
from
a
young
member
on
his
first
session
be
think
to
be
inexpedient
,
Miss
Flood
Jones
and
the
Miss
Finns
be
quite
willing
to
accept
the
wisdom
of
this
decision
,
much
as
they
may
regret
the
effect
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
when
she
meet
her
hero

hardly
dare
to
look
him
in
the
face

but
she
remember
accurately
all
the
circumstance
of
her
last
interview
with
him
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
he
wear
that
ringlet
near
his
heart
?
<EOS>
Mary
have
receive
from
Barbara
Finn
certain
hair
suppose
to
have
come
from
the
head
of
Phineas
,
and
these
she
always
wear
near
her
own
.
<EOS>
and
moreover
,
since
she
have
see
Phineas
she
have
refuse
an
offer
of
marriage
from
Mr.
Elias
Bodkin
<EOS>
,
 
have
refuse
it
almost
ignominiously

when
do
so
have
tell
herself

would
never

false

accident
that
I
have
to
go
to
the
house
of
a
man
whom
perhaps
you
would
call
a
grandee
,
and
to
meet
grandee
there
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
only
for
a
few
day
,
and
I
be
very
glad
to
be
take
in
again
here
,
I
can
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
very
glad
we
all
be
to
have
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
glad
to
see
me
,
Mary
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
glad
.
<EOS>
why
should
I
not
be
glad
,
and
Barbara
the
dear
friend
I
have
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
of
course
she
talk
about
you
,
 
and
that
make
me
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
know
,
Mary
,
how
often
I
think
about
you
.
"
<EOS>
then
Mary
,
who
be
very
happy
at
hear
such
word
,
and
who
be
walk
in
to
dinner
with
him
at
the
moment
,
could
not
refrain
herself
from
press
his
arm
with
her
little
finger
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
Phineas
in
his
position
could
not
marry
at
once
;
but
she
would
wait
for
him
,
 
oh
,
for
ever
,
if
he
would
only
ask
her
.
<EOS>
He
of
course
be
a
wicked
traitor
to
tell
her
that
he
be
will
not
to
think
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
jove
smile
at
lover
'
perjury
;
 
and
it
be
well
that
he
should
do
so
,
as
such
perjury
can
hardly
be
avoid
altogether
in
the
difficult
circumstance
of
a
successful
gentleman
's
life
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
a
traitor
,
of
course
,
but
he
be
almost
force
to
be
a
traitor
,
by
the
simple
fact
that
Lady
Laura
Standish
be
in
London
,
and
Mary
Flood
Jones
in
Killaloe
.
  
<EOS>
He
remain
for
nearly
five
month
at
Killaloe
,
and
I
doubt
whether
his
time
be
altogether
well
spend
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
book
recommend
to
him
by
Mr.
Monk
he
probably
do
read
,
and
be
often
to
be
find
encompass
by
blue
book
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
there
be
a
grain
of
pretence
about
his
blue
book
and
parliamentary
paper
,
and
that
in
these
day
he
be
,
in
a
gentle
way
,
something
of
an
impostor
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
be
angry
with
me
for
not
go
to
you
,
"
he
say
once
to
Mary
's
mother
when
he
have
decline
an
invitation
to
drink
tea
;
"
but
the
fact
be
that
my
time
be
not
my
own
.
"
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
make
any
apology
.
<EOS>
We
be
quite
aware
that
we
have
very
little
to
offer
,
"
say
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
,
who
be
not
altogether
happy
about
Mary
,
and
who
perhaps
know
more
about
member
of
Parliament
and
blue
book
than
Phineas
Finn
have
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
you
be
a
fool
to
think
of
that
man
,
"
the
mother
say
to
her
daughter
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
of
him
,
mamma
;
not
particularly
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
be
no
well
than
anybody
else
that
I
can
see
,
and
he
be
begin
to
give
himself
air
,
"
say
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
Mary
make
no
answer
;
but
she
go
up
into
her
room
and
swear
before
a
figure
of
the
Virgin
that
she
would
be
true
to
Phineas
for
ever
and
ever
,
in
spite
of
her
mother
,
in
spite
of
all
the
world
,
 
in
spite
,
should
it
be
necessary
,
even
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
about
<EOS>
Christmas
time
there
come
a
discussion
between
Phineas
and
his
father
about
money
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
find
you
get
on
pretty
well
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
who
think
that
he
have
be
liberal
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
tight
fit
,
"
say
Phineas
,
 
who
be
less
afraid
of
his
father
than
he
have
be
when
he
last
discuss
these
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hope
it
would
have
be
ample
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
think
for
a
moment
,
sir
,
that
I
be
complain
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
be
much
more
than
I
have
a
right
to
expect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
begin
to
make
an
inquiry
within
his
own
breast
as
to
whether
his
son
have
a
right
to
expect
anything
;
 
whether
the
time
have
not
come
in
which
his
son
should
be
earn
his
own
bread
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
he
say
,
after
a
pause
,
"
there
be
no
chance
of
your
do
anything
at
the
bar
now
?
"
  
"
not
immediately
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
impossible
to
combine
the
two
study
together
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
himself
be
aware
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
not
to
suppose
that
I
have
give
the
profession
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
 
after
all
the
money
it
have
cost
us
.
"
  
"
by
no
means
,
sir
.
<EOS>
and
all
that
I
be
do
now
will
,
I
trust
,
be
of
assistance
to
me
when
I
shall
come
back
to
work
at
the
law
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
on
the
card
that
I
may
go
into
office
,
 
and
if
so
,
public
business
will
become
my
profession
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
be
turn
out
with
the
Ministry
!
"
  
"
yes
;
that
be
true
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
must
run
my
chance
.
<EOS>
if
the
bad
come
to
the
bad
,
I
hope
I
may
be
able
to
secure
some
permanent
place
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
that
I
can
hardly
fail
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
I
trust
I
may
never
be
drive
to
want
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
however
,
that
we
have
settle
all
this
before
.
"
<EOS>
then
Phineas
assume
a
look
of
injure
innocence
,
as
though
his
father
be
drive
him
too
hard
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
in
the
mean
time
your
money
have
be
enough
?
"
say
the
doctor
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
intend
to
ask
you
to
advance
me
a
hundred
pound
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
expense
to
which
I
be
drive
on
first
enter
Parliament
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
a
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
if
it
be
inconvenient
,
sir
,
I
can
do
without
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
not
as
yet
pay
for
his
gun
,
or
for
that
velvet
coat
in
which
he
have
be
shoot
,
or
,
most
probably
,
for
the
knickerbocker
.
<EOS>
He
know
he
want
the
hundred
pound
badly
;
but
he
feel
ashamed
of
himself
in
ask
for
it
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
once
in
office
,
 
though
the
office
be
but
a
sorry
junior
lordship
,
 
he
would
repay
his
father
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
,
of
course
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
but
do
not
let
the
necessity
for
ask
for
more
hundred
come
oftener
than
you
can
help
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
say
that
he
would
not
,
and
then
there
be
no
further
discourse
about
money
.
<EOS>
It
need
hardly
be
say
that
he
tell
his
father
nothing
of
that
bill
which
he
have
endorse
for
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
come
the
time
which
call
him
again
to
London
and
the
glory
of
London
life
,
 
to
lobby
,
and
the
club
,
and
the
gossip
of
man
in
office
,
and
the
chance
of
promotion
for
himself
;
to
the
glare
of
the
gas
-
lamp
,
the
mock
anger
of
rival
debater
,
and
the
prospect
of
the
Speaker
's
wig
.
<EOS>
during
the
idleness
of
the
recess
he
have
resolve
at
any
rate
upon
this
,
 
that
a
month
of
the
session
should
not
have
pass
by
before
he
have
be
see
upon
his
leg
in
the
House
,
 
have
be
see
and
hear
.
<EOS>
and
many
a
time
as
he
have
wander
alone
,
with
his
gun
,
across
the
bog
which
lie
on
the
other
side
of
the
Shannon
from
Killaloe
,
he
have
practise
the
sort
of
address
which
he
would
make
to
the
House
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
short
,
 
always
short
;
and
he
would
eschew
all
action
and
gesticulation
;
Mr.
Monk
have
be
very
urgent
in
his
instruction
to
him
on
that
head
;
but
he
would
be
especially
careful
that
no
word
should
escape
him
which
have
not
in
them
some
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
wrong
in
his
purpose
,
but
purpose
there
should
be
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
twit
more
than
once
at
Killaloe
with
his
silence
;
 
for
it
have
be
conceive
by
his
fellow
-
townsman
that
he
have
be
send
to
Parliament
on
the
special
ground
of
his
eloquence
.
<EOS>
They
should
twit
him
no
more
on
his
next
return
.
<EOS>
He
would
speak
and
would
carry
the
House
with
him
if
a
human
effort
may
prevail
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
pack
up
his
thing
,
and
start
again
for
London
in
the
beginning
of
February
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
good
-
bye
,
Mary
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
with
his
sweetest
smile
.
<EOS>
but
on
this
occasion
there
be
no
kiss
,
and
no
culling
of
lock
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
can
not
help
it
,
"
say
Mary
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
his
position
.
<EOS>
but
whether
it
be
for
good
or
evil
,
I
will
be
true
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
you
be
unhappy
,
"
Babara
Finn
say
to
her
on
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
be
not
unhappy
,
 
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
deal
to
make
me
happy
and
proud
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
be
a
bit
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
she
turn
away
and
cry
heartily
,
and
Barbara
Finn
cry
with
her
for
company
.
   
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
return
to
London
 
<EOS>

and

as
how
he

a
young
Equity
draftsman
and
wife
and
baby
as
would
take
the
whole
house
,
and
all
because
Miss
Pouncefoot

a
word
about
her
port
wine
,
which
any
lady
of
her
age
may
say
in
her
tantrum
,
and
mean
nothing
after
all
.
<EOS>
Me
and
Miss
Pouncefoot

for
seven
year
,
and
what

or

?
<EOS>
but
,
honour
sir
,
it
be
not
about
that
as
I

to
trouble
you
,
but
to
ask
if
I
may
say
for
certain
that
you
will
take
the
room
again
in
February
.
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
let
them
for
the
month
after
Christmas
,
because
of
the
pantomime
.
<EOS>
only
say
at
once
,
because
Bunce
be
nag
me
day
after
day
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
nobody
's
wife
and
baby
to
have
to
do
for
,
and
'd
sooner
have
a
Parliament
gent
like
yourself
than
any
one
else
.
  
<EOS>
yours
umbly
and
respectful
,
  
JANE
bunce
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
he
reply
that
he
would
certainly
come
back
to
the
room
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
should
he
be
lucky
enough
to
find
them
vacant
,
and
he
express
his
willingness
to
take
them
on
and
from
the
1st
of
February
.
<EOS>
and
on
the
3rd
of
February
he
find
himself
in
the
old
quarter
,
Mrs.
Bunce
have
contrive
,
with
much
conjugal
adroitness
,
both
to
keep
Miss
Pouncefoot
and
to
stave
off
the
Equity
draftsman
's
wife
and
baby
.
<EOS>
bunce
,
however
,
receive
Phineas
very
coldly
,
and
tell
his
wife
the
same
evening
that
as
far
as
he
could
see
their
lodger
would
never
turn
up
to
be
a
trump
in
the
matter
of
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
mean
well
,
why
do
he
go
and
stay
with
them
lord
down
in
Scotland
?
<EOS>
I
know
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
man
when
I
see
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
,
who
be
look
out
to
be
a
Tory
judge
some
of
these
day
,

a
deal
better
;
 
because

after
.
"
  
<EOS>
immediately
on
his
return
to
town
,
Phineas
find
himself
summon
to
a
political
meeting
at
Mr.
Mildmay
's
house
in

We

<EOS>
"
I

"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose

"
  
<EOS>
now
,
in
truth
,
Phineas
have
hear
very
little
of
any
settle
plan
down
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
He
have
play
a
game
of
chess
with
Mr.
Gresham
,
and
have
shoot
a
stag
with
Mr.
Palliser
,
and

sheep
with
Lord
Brentford
,
but
have
hardly
hear
a
word
about
politic
from
any
one
of
those
influential
gentleman
.
<EOS>
from
Mr.
Monk
he
have
hear
much
of
a
come
Reform
Bill
;
but
his
communication
with
Mr.
Monk
have
rather
be
private
discussion
,
 
in
which
he
have
learn
Mr.
Monk
's
own
view
on
certain
point
,
 
than
revelation
on
the
intention
of
the
party
to
which
Mr.
Monk
belong
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
of
nothing
settle
,
"
say
Phineas
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
we
be
to
have
a
Reform
Bill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
suppose
we
be
not
to
touch
the
question
of
ballot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
difficulty
,
"
say
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
of
course
we
shall
not
touch
it
as
long
as
Mr.
Mildmay
be
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
consent
to
the
ballot
as
First
Minister
of
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
would
Gresham
,
or
Palliser
,
"
say
Phineas
,
who
do
not
choose
to
bring
forward
his
great
gun
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
about
Gresham
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
say
what
Gresham
may
bring
himself
to
do
.
<EOS>
Gresham
be
a
man
who
may
go
any
length
before
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
planty
Pall
,
"
 
for
such
be
the
name
by
which
Mr.
Plantagenet
Palliser
be
ordinarily
know
among
his
friend
,
 
"
would
of
course
go
with
Mr.
Mildmay
and
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
Monk
be
oppose
to
the
ballot
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
that
be
the
question
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
have
assent
to
the
proposition
of
a
measure
without
the
ballot
;
but
if
there
should
come
a
row
,
and
man
like
turnbull
demand
it
,
and
the
London
mob
kick
up
a
shindy
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
how
far
Monk
would
be
steady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
whatever
he
say
,
he
will
stick
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
your
leader
,
then
?
"
ask
Barrington
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
I
have
a
leader
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
lead
our
side
;
and
if
anybody
lead
me
,
he
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
great
faith
in
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
one
who
would
go
for
the
ballot
to
-
morrow
,
if
it
be
bring
forward
stoutly
,
"
say
Barrington
Erle
to
Mr.
Ratler
a
few
minute
afterwards
,
point
to
Phineas
as
he
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
much
of
that
young
man
,
"
say
Ratler
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
and
Mr.
Ratler
have
put
their
head
together
during
that
last
evening
at
Loughlinter
,
and
have
agree
that
they
do
not
think
much
of
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
why
do
Mr.
Kennedy
go
down
off
the
mountain
to
get
him
a
pony
?
<EOS>
and
why
do
Mr.
Gresham
play
chess
with
him
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
and
Mr.
Bonteen
may
have
be
right
in
make
up
their
mind
to
think
<EOS>
but
little
of
Phineas
Finn
,
but
Barrington
Erle
have
be
quite
wrong
when
he
have
say
that
Phineas
would
"
go
for
the
ballot
"
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
make
up
his
mind
very
strongly
that
he
would
always
oppose
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
that
he
would
hold
the
same
opinion
throughout
his
life
,
no
one
should
pretend
to
say
;
but
in
his
present
mood
,
and
under
the
tuition
which
he
have
receive
from
Mr.
Monk
,
he
be
prepared
to
demonstrate
,
out
of
the
House
and
in
it
,
that
the
ballot
be
,
as
a
political
measure
,
unmanly
,
ineffective
,
and
enervate
.
<EOS>
enervate
have
be
a
great
word
with
Mr.
Monk
,
and
Phineas
have
cling
to
it
with
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
the
meeting
take
place
at
Mr.
Mildmay
's
on
the
third
day
of
the
session
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
of
course
hear
of
such
meeting
before
,
but
have
never
attend
one
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
have
be
no
such
gathering
when
Mr.
Mildmay
's
party
come
into
power
early
in
the
last
session
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
and
his
man
have
then
make
their
effort
in
turn
out
their
opponent
,
and
have
be
well
pleased
to
rest
awhile
upon
their
oar
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
they
must
go
again
to
work
,
and
therefore
the
liberal
party
be
collect
at
Mr.
Mildmay
's
house
,
in
order
that
the
liberal
party
may
be
tell
what
it
be
that
Mr.
Mildmay
and
his
Cabinet
intend
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
be
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
what
would
be
the
nature
of
the
performance
on
this
occasion
,
and
entertain
some
idea
that
every
gentleman
present
would
be
call
upon
to
express
individually
his
assent
or
dissent
in
regard
to
the
measure
propose
.
<EOS>
He
walk
to
St.
James
's
Square
with
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
;
but
even
with
Fitzgibbon
be
ashamed
to
show
his
ignorance
by
ask
question
.
<EOS>
"
after
all
,
"
say
Fitzgibbon
,
"
this
kind
of
thing
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
know
as
well
as
possible
,
and
so
do
you
,
what
Mr.
Mildmay
will
say
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
Gresham
will
say
a
few
word
;
and
then
Turnbull
will
make
a
murmur
,
and
then
we
shall
all
assent
,
 
to
anything
or
to
nothing
;
 
and
then
it
will
be
over
.
"
<EOS>
still
Phineas
do
not
understand
whether
the
assent
require
would
or
would
not
be
an
individual
personal
assent
.
<EOS>
when
the
affair
be
over
he
find
that
he
be
disappoint
,
and
that
he
may
almost
as
well
have
stay
away
from
the
meeting
,
 
except
that
he
have
attend
at
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bidding
,
and
have
give
a
silent
adhesion
to
Mr.
Mildmay
's
plan
of
reform
for
that
session
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
have
be
very
nearly
correct
in
his
description
of
what
would
occur
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
make
a
long
speech
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
,
the
great
Radical
of
the
day
,
 
the
man
who
be
suppose
to
represent
what
many
call
the
Manchester
school
of
politic
,
 
ask
half
a
dozen
question
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
these
Mr.
Gresham
make
a
short
speech
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Mildmay
make
another
speech
,
and
then
all
be
over
.
<EOS>
the
gist
of
the
whole
thing
be
,
that
there
should
be
a
Reform
Bill
,
 
very
generous
in
its
enlargement
of
the
franchise
,
 
but
no
ballot
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
express
his
doubt
whether
this
would
be
satisfactory
to
the
country
;
but
even
Mr.
Turnbull
be
soft
in
his
tone
and
complaisant
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
reporter
present
,
 
<EOS>
that
plan
of
turn
private
meeting
at
gentleman
's
house
into
public
assembly
not
have
be
as
yet
adopt
,
 
there
could
be
no
need
for
energy
or
violence
.
<EOS>
They
go
to
Mr.
Mildmay
's
house
to
hear
Mr.
Mildmay
's
plan
,
 
and
they
hear
it
.
  
<EOS>
two
day
after
this
Phineas
be
to
dine
with
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
have
ask
him
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
give
dinner
party
,
"
he
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
should
like
you
to
come
and
meet
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
accept
the
invitation
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
who
say
that
Mr.
Turnbull
be
the
great
man
in
the
nation
,
and
that
the
nation
could
be
save
only
by
a
direct
obedience
to
Mr.
Turnbull
's
instruction
.
<EOS>
other
say
that
Mr.
Turnbull
be
a
demagogue
and
at
heart
a
rebel
;
that
he
be
un
-
English
,
false
and
very
dangerous
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
rather
inclined
to
believe
the
latter
statement
;
and
as
danger
and
dangerous
man
be
always
more
attractive
than
safety
and
safe
man
,
he
be
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
meet
Mr.
Turnbull
at
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
he
go
to
call
on
Lady
Laura
,
whom
he
have
not
see
since
the
last
evening
which
he
spend
in
her
company
at
Loughlinter
,
 
<EOS>
whom
,
when
he
be
last
speak
to
her
,
he
have
kiss
close
beneath
the
fall
of
the
Linter
.
<EOS>
He
find
her
at
home
,
and
with
her
be
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
Darby
and
Joan
meeting
,
be
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
get
up
to
welcome
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
Mr.
Kennedy
before
,
and
have
be
stand
close
to
him
during
the
meeting
at
Mr.
Mildmay
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
to
find
you
both
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
Robert
be
go
away
this
instant
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
he
tell
you
of
our
adventure
at
Rome
?
"
  
"
not
a
word
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
must
tell
you
;
 
but
not
now
.
<EOS>
the
dear
old
Pope
be
so
civil
to
us
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
think
it
quite
a
pity
that
he
should
be
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
off
,
"
say
the
husband
,
get
up
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
shall
meet
you
at
dinner
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
dine
at
Mr.
Monk
's
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
be
ask
expressly
to
hear
Turnbull
make
a
convert
of
you
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
to
be
us
four
.
<EOS>
au
revoir
.
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Kennedy
go
,
and
Phineas
find
himself
alone
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
know
how
to
address
her
,
and
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
prepare
himself
for
the
interview
as
he
ought
to
have
do
,
and
feel
himself
to
be
awkward
.
<EOS>
She
evidently
expect
him
to
speak
,
and
for
a
few
second
sit
wait
for
what
he
may
say
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
she
find
that
it
be
incumbent
on
her
to
begin
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
surprised
at
our
suddenness
when
you
get
my
note
?
"
  
"
a
little
.
<EOS>
You
have
speak
of
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
imagine
that
he
would
have
be
impetuous
.
<EOS>
and
he
seem
to
think
that
even
the
business
of
get
himself
married
would
not
justify
him
stay
away
from
Parliament
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
rigid
martinet
in
all
matter
of
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wonder
that
he
should
be
in
a
hurry
,
but
that
you
should
submit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
that
I
should
do
just
what
the
wise
people
tell
me
.
<EOS>
I
ask
papa
,
and
he
say
that
it
would
be
well
.
<EOS>
so
the
lawyer
be
drive
out
of
their
mind
,
and
the
milliner
out
of
their
body
,
and
the
thing
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
there
at
the
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
that
I
know
be
what
you
mean
to
ask
.
<EOS>
Papa
say
that
he
may
come
if
he
please
.
<EOS>
Oswald
stipulate
that
he
should
be
receive
as
a
son
.
<EOS>
then
my
father
speak
the
hard
word
that
ever
fall
from
his
mouth
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
not
repeat
it
,
 
not
altogether
.
<EOS>
but
he
say
that
Oswald
be
not
entitle
to
a
son
's
treatment
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
sore
about
my
money
,
because
Robert
be
so
generous
as
to
his
settlement
.
<EOS>
so
the
breach
between
them
be
as
wide
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
where
be
Chiltern
now
?
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
down
in
Northamptonshire
,
stay
at
some
inn
from
whence
he
hunt
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
he
be
quite
alone
,
 
that
he
never
dine
out
,
never
have
any
one
to
dine
with
him
,
that
he
hunt
five
or
six
day
a
week
,
 
and
read
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
a
bad
sort
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
if
the
reading
be
any
good
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
bear
that
he
should
be
so
solitary
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
break
down
in
it
,
then
his
companion
will
not
be
fit
for
him
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
hunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
 
at
home
in
county
Clare
.
<EOS>
all
Irishmen
hunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
go
down
to
him
and
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
delighted
to
have
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
think
over
the
proposition
before
he
answer
it
,
and
then
make
the
reply
that
he
have
make
once
before
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
do
so
,
Lady
Laura
,
 
but
that
I
have
no
money
for
hunting
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
alas
,
alas
!
"
say
she
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
that
hit
one
on
every
side
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
manage
it
,
 
for
a
couple
of
day
,
 
in
March
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
do
what
you
think
you
ought
not
to
do
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
certainly
.
<EOS>
but
I
should
like
it
,
and
if
I
can
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
could
mount
you
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
other
expense
now
,
and
keep
a
stable
full
of
horse
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
have
seven
or
eight
.
<EOS>
and
now
tell
me
,
Mr.
Finn
;
when
be
you
go
to
charm
the
House
?
<EOS>
or
be
it
your
first
intention
to
strike
terror
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
blush
,
 
he
know
that
he
blush
as
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
suppose
I
shall
make
some
sort
of
attempt
before
long
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
be
a
bore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
ought
to
speak
,
Mr.
Finn
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
about
that
,
but
I
certainly
mean
to
try
.
<EOS>
there
will
be
lot
of
opportunity
about
the
new
Reform
Bill
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
know
that
Mr.
Mildmay
be
go
to
bring
it
in
at
once
.
<EOS>
You
hear
all
that
from
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and

me

I
still
see
papa
almost
every
day

<EOS>
You
must
call
upon
him
.
<EOS>
mind
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
say
that
he
certainly
would
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
be
very
lonely
now
,
and
I
sometimes
feel
that
I
have
be
almost
cruel
in
desert
him
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
that
he
have
a
horror
of
the
house
,
 
especially
later
in
the
year
,
 
always
fancy
that
he
will
meet
Oswald

<EOS>
I
be
so
unhappy
about
it
all
,
Mr.
Finn

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
your
brother
marry
?
"
say
Phineas
,
know
nothing
as
yet
of
Lord
Chiltern
and
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
to
marry
well

that
would
bring
your

round

<EOS>
"
yes
,
 
it
would

"
  
"

and
why
should
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
pause
before
she
answer
;
and
then
she
tell
the
whole
story
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
violently
in
love
,
and
the
girl
he
love
have
refuse
him
twice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
with
Miss
Effingham
?
"
ask
Phineas
,
guess
the
truth
at
once
,
and
remember
what
Miss
Effingham
have
say
to
him
when
ride
in
the
wood
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
 
with
Violet
Effingham
;
my
father
's
pet
,
his
favourite
,
whom
he
love
next
to
myself
,
 
almost
as
well
as
myself
;
whom
he
would
really
welcome
as
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
would
gladly
make
her
mistress
of
his
house
,
and
of
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
everything
would
then
go
smoothly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
she
do
not
like
Lord
Chiltern
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
love
him
in
her
heart
;
but
she
be
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
as
she
say
herself
,
a
girl
be
bind
to
be
so
careful
of
herself
.
<EOS>
with
all
her
seeming
frolic
,
Violet
Effingham
be
very
wise
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
though
not
conscious
of
anything
akin
to
jealousy
,
be
annoy
at
the
revelation
make
to
him
.
<EOS>
since
he
have
hear
that
Lord
Chiltern
be
in
love
with
Miss
Effingham
,
he
do
not
like
Lord
Chiltern
quite
as
well
as
he
have
do
before
.
<EOS>
He
himself
have
simply
admire
Miss
Effingham
,
and
have
take
pleasure
in
her
society
;
but
,
though
this
have
be
all
,
he
do
not
like
to
hear
of
another
man
want
to
marry
her
,
and
he
be
almost
angry
with
Lady
Laura
for
say
that
she
believe
Miss
Effingham
love
her
brother
.
<EOS>
if
Miss
Effingham
have
twice
refuse
Lord
Chiltern
,
that
ought
to
have
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
Phineas
be
in
love
with
Miss
Effingham
himself
.
<EOS>
as
he
be
still
violently
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
,
any
other
love
be
of
course
impossible
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
there
be
something
offensive
to
him
in
the
story
as
it
have
be
tell
.
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
wisdom
on
her
part
,
"
say
he
,
answer
Lady
Laura
's
last
word
<EOS>
,
"
you
can
not
find
fault
with
her
for
her
decision
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
no
fault
;
 
but
<EOS>
I
think
my
brother
would
make
her
happy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
,
when
she
be
leave
alone
,
at
once
revert
to
the
tone
in
which
Phineas
Finn
have
answer
her
remark
about
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
very
ill
able
to
conceal
his
thought
,
and
wear
his
heart
almost
upon
his
sleeve
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Can
it
be
possible
that
he
care
for
her
himself
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
be
the
nature
of
Lady
Laura
's
first
question
to
herself
upon
the
matter
.
<EOS>
and
in
ask
herself
that
question
,
she
think
nothing
of
the
disparity
in
rank
or
fortune
between
Phineas
Finn
and
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
nor
do
it
occur
to
her
as
at
all
improbable
that
Violet
may
accept
the
love
of
him
who
have
so
lately
be
her
own
lover
.
<EOS>
but
the
idea
grate
against
her
wish
on
two
side
.
<EOS>
She
be
most
anxious
that
Violet
should
ultimately
become
her
brother
's
wife
,
 
<EOS>
and
she
could
not
be
pleased
that
Phineas
should
be
able
to
love
any
woman
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
beg
my
reader
not
to
be
carry
away
by
those
last
word
into
any
erroneous
conclusion
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
suppose
that
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
,
the
lately
married
bride
,
indulge
a
guilty
passion
for
the
young
man
who
have
love
her
.
<EOS>
though
she
have
probably
think
often
of
Phineas
Finn
since
her
marriage
,
her
thought
have
never
be
of
a
nature
to
disturb
her
rest
.
<EOS>
It
have
never
occur
to
her
even
to
think
that
she
regard
him
with
any
feeling
that
be
an
offence
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
hate
herself
have
any
such
idea
present
itself
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
pride
herself
on
be
a
pure
high
-
principled
woman
,
who
have
keep
so
strong
a
guard
upon
herself
as
to
be
nearly
free
from
the
danger
of
those
rock
upon
which
other
woman
make
shipwreck
of
their
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
take
pride
in
this
,
and
would
then
blame
herself
for
her
own
pride
.
<EOS>
but
though
she
so
blame
herself
,
it
never
occur
to
her
to
think
that
to
her
there
may
be
danger
of
such
shipwreck
.
<EOS>
She
have
put
away
from
herself
the
idea
of
love
when
she
have
first
perceive
that
Phineas
have
regard
her
with
more
than
friendship
,
and
have
accept
Mr.
Kennedy
's
offer
with
an
assured
conviction
that
by
do
so
she
be
act
good
for
her
own
happiness
and
for
that
of
all
those
concerned
.
<EOS>
She
have
feel
the
romance
of
the
position
to
be
sweet
when
Phineas
have
stand
with
her
at
the
top
of
the
fall
of
the
Linter
,
and
have
tell
her
of
the
hope
which
he
have
dare
to
indulge
.
<EOS>
and
when
at
the
bottom
of
the
fall
he
have
presume
to
take
her
in
his
arm
,
she
have
forgive
him
without
difficulty
to
herself
,
tell
herself
that
that
would
be
the
alpha
and
the
omega
of
the
romance
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
feel
herself
bind
to
tell
Mr.
Kennedy
of
what
have
occur
,
 
but
she
have
feel
that
he
could
hardly
have
be
angry
<EOS>
even
have
he
be
tell
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
often
think
of
her
lover
since
,
and
of
his
love
,
 
tell
herself
that
she
too
have
once
have
a
lover
,
never
regard
her
husband
in
that
light
;
but
her
thought
have
not
frighten
her
as
guilty
thought
will
do
.
<EOS>
there
have
come
a
romance
which
have
be
pleasant
,
and
it
be
go
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
soon
banish
,
 
but
it
have
leave
to
her
a
sweet
flavour
,
of
which
she
love
to
taste
the
sweetness
though
she
know
that
it
be
go
.
<EOS>
and
the
man
should
be
her
friend
,
but
especially
her
husband
's
friend
.
<EOS>
It
should
be
her
care
to
see
that
his
life
be
successful
,
 
and
especially
her
husband
's
care
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
delight
to
her
to
know
that
her
husband
like
the
man
.
<EOS>
and
the
man
would
marry
,
and
the
man
's
wife
should
be
her
friend
.
<EOS>
all
this
have
be
very
pure
and
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
now
an
idea
have
flit
across
her
brain
that
the
man
be
in
love
with
some
one
else
,
 
and
she
do
not
like
it
!
  
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
therefore
become
afraid
of
herself
,
or
in
the
least
realise
at
once
the
danger
of
her
own
position
.
<EOS>
Her
immediate
glance
at
the
matter
do
not
go
beyond
the
falseness
of
man
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
as
she
suspect
,
 
if
Phineas
have
in
truth
transfer
his
affection
to
Violet
Effingham
,
of
how
little
value
be
the
love
of
such
a
man
!
<EOS>
It
do
not
occur
to
her
at
this
moment
that
she
also
have
transfer
her
to
Robert
Kennedy
,
or
that
,
if
not
,
she
have
do
bad
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
remember
that
in
the
autumn
this
young
Phoebus
among
man
have
turn
his
back
upon
her
out
upon
the
mountain
that
he
may
hide
from
her
the
agony
of
his
heart
when
he
learn
that
she
be
to
be
the
wife
of
another
man
;
and
that
now
,
before
the
winter
be
over
,
he
could
not
hide
from
her
the
fact
that
his
heart
be
elsewhere
!
<EOS>
and
then
she
speculate
,
and
count
up
fact
,
and
satisfy
herself
that
Phineas
could
not
even
have
see
Violet
Effingham
since
they
two
have
stand
together
upon
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
how
false
be
man
!
 
<EOS>
how
false
and
how
weak
of
heart
!
  
<EOS>
"
Chiltern
and
Violet
Effingham
!
"
say
Phineas
to
himself
,
as
he
walk
away
from
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
"
be
it
fair
that
she
should
be
sacrifice
because
she
be
rich
,
and
because
she
be
so
win
and
so
fascinating
that
Lord
Brentford
would
receive
even
his
son
for
the
sake
of
receive
also
such
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
?
"
<EOS>
phinea
also
like
Lord
Chiltern
;
have
see
or
fancy
that
he
have
see
fine
thing
in
him
;
have
look
forward
to
his
regeneration
,
hope
,
perhaps
,
that
he
may
have
some
hand
in
the
good
work
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
recognise
the
propriety
of
sacrifice
Violet
Effingham
even
for
work
so
good
as
this
.
<EOS>
if
Miss
Effingham
have
refuse
Lord
Chiltern
twice
,
surely
that
ought
to
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
occur
to
him
that
the
love
of
such
a
girl
as
Violet
would
be
a
great
treasure
 
to
himself
.
<EOS>
as
regard
himself
,
he
be
still
in
love
,
 
hopelessly
in
love
,
with
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
!
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
Wednesday
evening
and
there
be
no
House
;
 
and
at
seven
o'clock
<EOS>
Phineas
be
at
Mr.
Monk
's
hall
door
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
first
of
the
guest
,
and
he
find
Mr.
Monk
alone
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
do
butler
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
,
who
have
a
brace
of
decanter
in
his
hand
,
which
he
proceed
to
put
down
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
finish
,
and
now
we
will
go
up
-
stair
to
receive
the
two
great
man
properly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
for
come
too
early
,
"
say
Finn
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
a
minute
too
early
.
<EOS>
seven
be
seven
,
and
it
be
I
who
be
too
late

<EOS>
but
,
Lord
bless
you
<EOS>
,
you
do
not
think
I
be
ashamed
of
be
find
in
the
act
of
decant
my
own
wine
!
<EOS>
I
remember
Lord
Palmerston
say
before
some
committee
about
salary
,
five
or
six
year
ago
now
,
I
daresay
,
that
it
would
not
do
for
an
English
Minister
to
have
his
hall
door
open
by
a
maid
-
servant
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
be
an
English
Minister
,
and
I
have
get
nobody
but
a
maid
-
servant
to
open
my
hall
door
,
and
I
be
oblige
to
look
after
my
own
wine
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
it
be
improper
?
<EOS>
I
should
not
like
to
be
the
mean
of
injure
the
British
Constitution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
if
you
resign
soon
,
and
if
nobody
follow
your
example
,
grave
evil
result
may
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sincerely
hope
so
,
for
I
do
love
the
British
Constitution
;
and
I
love
also
the
respect
in
which
member
of
the
English
Cabinet
be
hold
.
<EOS>
now
Turnbull
,
who
will
be
here
in
a
moment
,
hate
it
all
;
but
he
be
a
rich
man
,
and
have
more
powdered
footman
hang
about
his
house
than
ever
Lord
Palmerston
have
himself

<EOS>

He
be
still
in
business

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

thousand

certainly

as
I
perceive

Mr.

who
be
well
at
a
speech
than
a

<EOS>
a

"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
one
more
so
in
all
London

say
Mr.
Monk
;
"
but
Finn
seem
to
think
that
I
ought
to
have
a
man
in

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference

Mr.

I

<EOS>
"
nor
I
either

Mr.

<EOS>
then
the
laird
of
Loughlinter
be
announce
,
and
they
all
go
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
be
a
good

look
robust
man
about
sixty
,
with
long
grey
hair
and
a
red
complexion

with
hard
eye
,
a
well

cut
nose

and
full
lip

He
be
nearly
six
foot
high

stand
quite
upright

and
always
wear
a
black
swallow
-
tail
coat
,
black
trouser
,
and
a
black
silk
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
in
the
House
,
at
least
,
he
be
always
so
dressed
,
and
at
dinner
table
.
<EOS>
what
difference
there
may
be
in
his
costume
<EOS>
when
at
home
at
Staleybridge
few
of
those
who
see
him
in
London
have
the
mean
of
know
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
his
face
to
indicate
special
talent
.
<EOS>
no
one
look
at
him
would
take
him
to
be
a
fool
;
but
there
be
none
of
the
fire
of
genius
in
his
eye
,
nor
be
there
in
the
line
of
his
mouth
any
of
that
play
of
thought

fancy
which
be
generally
to
be
find
in
the
face
of
man

have
make
themselves
great

<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
have
certainly
make
himself
great

could
hardly
have
do
so
without
force
of
intellect

He
be
one
of
the
most
popular

if
not
the
most
popular
politician
in

that
he
be
their
most
honest
public
friend
;
and
man
who
be
not
poor
believe
in
his
power
,
think
that
his
counsel
must
surely
prevail
.
<EOS>
He
have
obtain
the
ear
of
the
House
and
the
favour
of
the
reporter
,
and
open
his
voice
at
no
public
dinner
,
on
no
public
platform
,
without
a
conviction
that
the
word
speak
by
him
would
be
read
by
thousand
.
<EOS>
the
first
necessity
for
good
speaking
be
a
large
audience
;
and
of
this
advantage
Mr.
Turnbull
have
make
himself
sure
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
could
hardly
be
say
that
he
be
a
great
orator
.
<EOS>
He
be
gift
with
a
powerful
voice
,
with
strong
,
and
I
may
,
perhaps
,
call
them
broad
conviction
,
with
perfect
self
-
reliance
,
with
almost
unlimited
power
of
endurance
,
with
hot
ambition
,
with
no
keen
scruple
,
and
with
a
moral
skin
of
great
thickness
.
<EOS>
nothing
say
against
him
pain
him
,
no
attack
wound
him
,
no
raillery
touch
him
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
sore
spot
about
him
,
and
probably
his
first
thought
on
wake
every
morning
tell
him
that
he
,
at
least
,
be
totus
tere
atque
rotundus
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
of
course
,
a
thorough
Radical
,
 
and
so
be
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Monk
's
first
wake
thought
be
probably
exactly
the
reverse
of
those
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
be
a
much
hot
man
in
debate
than
Mr.
Turnbull
;
 
but
Mr.
Monk
be
ever
doubt
of
himself
,
and
never
doubt
of
himself
so
much
as
when
he
have
be
most
violent
,
and
also
most
effective
,
in
debate
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Monk
jeer
at
himself
for
be
a
Cabinet
Minister
and
keep
no
attendant
grander
than
a
parlour
-
maid
,
there
be
a
substratum
of
self
-
doubt
under
the
joke
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
be
certainly
a
great
Radical
,
and
as
such
enjoy
a
great
reputation
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
high
office
in
the
state
have
ever
be
offer
to
him
;
but
thing
have
be
say
which
justify
him
,
or
seem
to
himself
to
justify
him
,
in
declare
that
in
no
possible
circumstance
would
he
serve
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
"
I
serve
the
people
,
"
he
have
say
,
"
and
much
as
I
respect
the
servant
of
the
Crown
<EOS>
,
I
think
that
my
own
office
be
the
high
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
be
greatly
call
to
task
for
this
speech
;
and
Mr.
Mildmay
,
the
present
Premier
,
have
ask
him
whether
he
do
not
recognise
the
so
-
call
servant
of
the
Crown
as
the
most
hard
-
worked
and
true
servant
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
the
House
and
the
press
have
support
Mr.
Mildmay
,
but
to
all
that
Mr.
Turnbull
be
quite
indifferent
;
and
when
an
assertion
make
by
him
before
three
or
four
thousand
person
at
Manchester
,
to
the
effect
that
he
,
 
he
specially
,
 
be
the
friend
and
servant
of
the
people
,
be
receive
with
acclamation
,
he
feel
quite
satisfied
that
he
have
gain
his
point
.
<EOS>
progressive
reform
in
the
franchise
,
of
which
manhood
suffrage
should
be
the
acknowledge
and
not
far
distant
end
,
equal
electoral
district
,
ballot
,
tenant
right
for
England
as
well
as
Ireland
,
reduction
of
the
stand
army
till
there
should
be
no
stand
army
to
reduce
,
utter
disregard
of
all
political
movement
in
Europe
,
an
almost
idolatrous
admiration
for
all
political
movement
in
America
,
free
trade
in
everything
except
malt
,
and
an
absolute
extinction
of
a
State
Church
,
 
<EOS>
these
be
among
the
principal
article
in
Mr.
Turnbull
's
political
catalogue
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
that
when
once
he
have
learn
the
art
of
arrange
his
word
as
he
stand
upon
his
leg
,
and
have
so
master
his
voice
as
to
have
obtain
the
ear
of
the
House
,
the
work
of
his
life
be
not
difficult
.
<EOS>
have
nothing
to
construct
,
he
could
always
deal
with
generality
.
<EOS>
be
free
from
responsibility
,
he
be
not
call
upon
either
to
study
detail
or
to
master
even
great
fact
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
business
to
inveigh
against
exist
evil
,
and
perhaps
there
be
no
easy
business
when
once
the
privilege
of
an
audience
have
be
attain
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
work
to
cut
down
forest
-
tree
,
and
he
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
subsequent
cultivation
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
have
once
tell
Phineas
Finn
how
great
be
the
charm
of
that
inaccuracy
which
be
permit
to
the
opposition
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
no
doubt
enjoy
these
charm
to
the
full
,
though
he
would
sooner
have
put
a
padlock
on
his
mouth
for
a
month
than
have
own
as
much
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
Mr.
Turnbull
be
no
doubt
right
in
resolve
that
he
would
not
take
office
,
though
some
reticence
on
that
subject
may
have
be
more
become
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
at
dinner
,
though
it
be
altogether
on
political
subject
,
have
in
it
nothing
of
special
interest
as
long
as
the
girl
be
there
to
change
the
plate
;
but
when
she
be
go
,
and
the
door
be
close
,
it
gradually
open
out
,
and
there
come
on
to
be
a
pleasant
spar
match
between
the
two
great
Radicals
,
 
the
Radical
who
have
join
himself
to
the
govern
power
,
and
the
Radical
who
stand
aloof
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
barely
say
a
word
now
and
then
,
and
Phineas
be
almost
as
silent
as
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
there
to
hear
some
such
discussion
,
and
be
quite
willing
to
listen
while
gun
of
such
great
calibre
be
be
fire
off
for
his
amusement
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Mr.
Mildmay
be
make
a
great
step
forward
,
"
say
Mr.
Turnbull
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
be
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
that
he
would
ever
live
to
go
so
far
.
<EOS>
It
will
hardly
suffice
even
for
this
year
;
but
still
come
from
him
,
it
be
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
It
only
show
how
far
a
man
may
be
make
to
go
,
if
only
the
proper
force
be
apply
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
it
matter
very
little
who
be
the
Ministers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
I
have
always
declare
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
little
indeed
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
mind
whether
it
be
Lord
de
Terrier
,
or
Mr.
Mildmay
,
or
Mr.
Gresham
,
or
you
yourself
,
if
you
choose
to
get
yourself
make
First
Lord
of
the
Treasury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
such
ambition
,
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
think
you
have
.
<EOS>
if
I
go
in
for
that
kind
of
thing
myself
,
I
should
like
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
I
should
feel
that
if
I
could
do
any
good
at
all
by
become
a
Minister
,
I
could
only
do
it
by
become
first
Minister
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
would
not
doubt
your
own
fitness
for
such
a
position
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
my
fitness
for
the
position
of
any
Minister
,
"
say
Mr.
Turnbull
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
on
other
ground
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
it
on
every
ground
,
"
say
Mr.
Turnbull
,
rise
on
his
leg
and
stand
with
his
back
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
be
not
fit
to
have
diplomatic
intercourse
with
man
who
would
come
to
me
simply
with
the
desire
of
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
unfit
to
deal
with
member
of
Parliament
who
would
flock
around
me
because
they
want
place
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
unfit
to
answer
every
man
's
question
so
as
to
give
no
information
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
you
not
answer
them
so
as
to
give
information
?
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Turnbull
be
so
intent
on
his
speech
that
it
may
be
doubt
whether
he
hear
this
interruption
.
<EOS>
He
take
no
notice
of
it
as
he
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
be
unfit
to
maintain
the
propriety
of
a
seeming
confidence
between
a
Crown
all
-
powerless
and
a
people
all
-
powerful
.
<EOS>
no
man
recognise
his
own
unfitness
for
such
work
more
clearly
than
I
do
,
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
take
in
hand
such
work
at
all
,
I
should
like
to
be
the
leader
,
and
not
the
lead
.
<EOS>
tell
us
fairly
,
now
,
what
be
your
conviction
worth
in
Mr.
Mildmay
's
Cabinet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
question
which
a
man
may
hardly
answer
himself
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
question
which
a
man
should
at
least
answer
for
himself
before
he
consent
to
sit
there
,
"
say
Mr.
Turnbull
,
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
be
almost
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
reason
have
you
for
supposing
that
I
have
omit
that
duty
?
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
simply
this
,
 
that
I
can
not
reconcile
your
know
opinion
with
the
practice
of
your
colleague
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
tell
you
what
my
conviction
may
be
worth
in
Mr.
Mildmay
's
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
they
be
worth
the
chair
on
which
I
sit
when
I
be
there
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
what
my
aspiration
be
when
I
consent
to
fill
that
chair
,
and
you
shall
judge
of
their
worth
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
they
may
possibly
leaven
the
batch
of
bread
which
we
have
to
bake
,
 
give
to
the
whole
batch
more
of
the
flavour
of
reform
than
it
would
have
possess
<EOS>
have
I
absent
myself
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
when
I
be
ask
to
join
Mr.
Mildmay
and
Mr.
Gresham
,
the
very
fact
of
that
request
indicate
liberal
progress
,
and
that
if
I
refuse
the
request
I
should
be
decline
to
assist
in
good
work

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
have
support
them

if
anything
be
propose
worthy
of

say
Mr.
Turnbull
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
I
could
not
have
be
so
effective
in
take
care
that
some
measure
be
propose
worthy
of
support
as
I
may
possibly
be
now
.
<EOS>
I
think
a
good
deal
about
it
,
and
I
believe
that
my
decision
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
be
right
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
can
be
no
juster
object
of
ambition
than
a
seat
in
the
Cabinet
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
must
dispute
that
,
"
say
Mr.
Turnbull
,
turn
round
upon
our
hero
.
<EOS>
"
I
regard
the
position
of
our
high
Ministers
as
most
respectable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
for
so
much
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
but
the
orator
go
on
again
,
regardless
of
the
interruption
:
    
"
the
position
of
gentleman
in
inferior
office
,
 
of
gentleman
who
attend
rather
to
the
nod
and
wink
of
their
superior
in
Downing
Street
than
to
the
interest
of
their
constituent
,
 
I
do
not
regard
as
be
highly
respectable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
man
can
not
begin
at
the
top
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
Mr.
Monk
have
begin
at
what
you
be
pleased
to
call
the
top
,
"
say
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
not
profess
to
think
that
even
he
have
raise
himself
by
go
into
office
.
<EOS>
to
be
an
independent
representative
of
a
really
popular
commercial
constituency
be
,
in
my
estimation
,
the
high
object
of
an
Englishman
's
ambition
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
why
commercial
,
Mr.
Turnbull
?
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
the
commercial
constituency
really
do
elect
their
own
member
in
accordance
with
their
own
judgment
,
whereas
the
county
and
the
small
town
be
coerce
either
by
individual
or
by
a
combination
of
aristocratic
influence
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
yet
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
there
be
not
half
a
dozen
conservative
return
by
all
the
county
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Scotland
be
very
much
to
be
honour
,
"
say
Mr.
Turnbull
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
be
the
first
to
take
his
departure
,
and
Mr.
Turnbull
follow
him
very
quickly
.
<EOS>
Phineas
get
up
to
go
at
the
same
time
,
but
stay
at
his
host
's
request
,
and
sit
for
awhile
smoke
a
cigar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Turnbull
be
a
wonderful
man
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
not
domineer
too
much
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
fault
be
not
arrogance
,
so
much
as
ignorance
that
there
be
,
or
should
be
,
a
difference
between
public
and
private
life
.
<EOS>
in
the
House
of
Commons
a
man
in
Mr.
Turnbull
's
position
must
speak
with
dictatorial
assurance
.
<EOS>
He
be
always
address
,
not
the
House
only
,
but
the
country
at
large
,
and
the
country
will
not
believe
in
him
unless
he
believe
in
himself
.
<EOS>
but
he
forget
that
he
be
not
always
address
the
country
at
large

<EOS>
I
wonder
what
sort
of
a
time
Mrs.
Turnbull
and
the
little
Turnbulls
have
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
go
home
,
make
up
his
mind
that
Mrs.

must
probably
have
a
bad
time
of

It
be
know
that
whatever
may
be
the
detail
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
,
the
ballot
would
not
form
a
part
of
it
;
and
<EOS>
as
there
be
a
strong
party
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
a
very
numerous
party
out
of
it
,
who
be
desirous
that
voting
by
ballot
should
be
make
a
part
of
the
electoral
law
,
it
be
decide
that
an
independent
motion
should
be
bring
on
in
anticipation
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
.
<EOS>
the
arrangement
be
probably
one
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
own
making
;
so
that
he
may
be
hamper
by
no
opposition
on
that
subject
by
his
own
follower
if
,
 
as
he
do
not
doubt
,
 
the
motion
should
be
lose
.
<EOS>
It
be
expect
that
the
debate
would
not
last
over
one
night
,
and
Phineas
resolve
that
he
would
make
his
maiden
speech
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
have
very
strong
opinion
as
to
the
inefficacy
of
the
ballot
for
any
good
purpose
,
and
think
that
he
may
be
able
to
strike
out
from
his
conviction
some
spark
of
that
fire
which
use
to
be
so
plentiful
with
him
at
the
old
debate
club
.
<EOS>
but
even
at
breakfast
that
morning
his
heart
begin
to
beat
quickly
at
the
idea
of
have
to
stand
on
his
leg
before
so
critical
an
audience
.
  
<EOS>
He
know
that
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
if
possible
get
the
subject
off
his
mind
during
the
day
,
and
therefore
go
out
among
the
people
who
certainly
would
not
talk
to
him
about
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
He
sit
for
nearly
an
hour
in
the
morning
with
Mr.
Low
,
and
do
not
even
tell
Mr.
Low
that
it
be
his
intention
to
speak
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
then
he
make
one
or
two
other
call
,
and
at
about
three
go
up
to
Portman
Square
to
look
for
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
nearly
the
end
of
February
,
and
Phineas
have
often
see
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
see
her
brother
,
but
have
learn
from
his
sister
that
he
have
be
drive
up
to
London
by
the
frost
,
He
be
tell
by
the
porter
at
Lord
Brentford
's
that
Lord
Chiltern
be
in
the
house
,
and
as
he
be
pass
through
the
hall
he
meet
Lord
Brentford
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
thus
drive
to
speak
,
and
feel
himself
call
upon
to
explain
why
he
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
to
see
Lord
Chiltern

he
say

<EOS>
"

"
You

say
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
myself
I
know
nothing
of
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
speak
in
an
angry
tone
,
as
though
he
resent
the
fact
that
any
one
should
come
to
his
house
to
call
upon
his
son
;
and
turn
his
back
quickly
upon
Phineas
.
<EOS>
but
he
think
better
of
it
before
he
reach
the
front
door
,
and
turn
again
.
<EOS>
"
by

the

he
,
"
what
majority

<EOS>
"
well

tolerably
safe

You
ought
to
speak
upon
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
may
,

Phineas
,
feel
that
he
blush
as
he
speak

<EOS>
"
do

the
Earl

<EOS>
"
do

<EOS>
if
you

Lord

you
tell
him
from
me
that
I
should
be
glad

"
phinea

much
astonish
at
the
commission
give
to
him
,
of
course
say
that
he
would
do
as
he
be
desire
,
and
then
pass
on
to
Lord
Chiltern
's
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
He
find
his
friend
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
without
coat
and
waistcoat
,
with
a
pair
of
dumb

bell
in
his
hand

<EOS>
"
when
there

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
good
exercise
,

Phineas

<EOS>

and
it
give
me
something
to
do
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
in
London
I
feel
like
a
gipsy
in
church
,
till
the
time
come
for
prowl
out
at
night
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
occupation
for
my
day
<EOS>
whatever
,
and
no
place
to
which
I
can
take
myself
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
stand
in
a
club
window
as
some
man
do
,
and
I
should
disgrace
any
decent
club
if
I
do
stand
there
.
<EOS>
I
belong
to
the
Travellers
,
but
I
doubt
whether
the
porter
would
let
me
go
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
pique
yourself
on

more
of

outer
bohemian

"
say
Phineas

<EOS>
"
I
pique
myself
on
this

that
whether
Bohemian

not

I
will
go
nowhere

though
,
 
for

continue

let
him
send

I

I

Laura

You

I
do

do
you
think
that
such
a

would
marry
such
a

I

<EOS>
She
would
be

about

what

They
have
paint

black

my

Your

I

My

make
some
further
sacrifice

have
fall
away

bent

"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
my

<EOS>
then
I
will
do
the
good
I
can

<EOS>
Laura
will
tell
you
of
the
result

"
  
<EOS>
the
father
would
have
give
the
son
some
advice
as
to
the
mode
in
which
he
should
put
forward
his
claim
upon
Violet
's
hand
,
but
the
son
would
not
wait
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
choose
to
presume
that
the
conference
be
over
,
he
go
back
to
the
room
in
which
he
have
keep
his
dumb
-
bell
,
and
for
a
minute
or
two
go
to
work
at
his
favourite
exercise
.
<EOS>
but
he
soon
put
the
dumb
-
bell
down
,
and
begin
to
prepare
himself
for
his
work
.
<EOS>
if
this
thing
be
to
be
do
,
it
may
as
well
be
do
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
look
out
of
his
window
,
and
see
that
the
street
be
in
a
mess
of
slush
.
<EOS>
white
snow
be
become
black
mud
,
as
it
will
do
in
London
;
and
the
violence
of
frost
be
give
way
to
the
horror
of
thaw
.
<EOS>
all
would
be
soft
and
comparatively
pleasant
in
Northamptonshire
on
the
following
morning
,
and
if
everything
go
right
he
would
breakfast
at
the
Willingford
Bull
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
down
by
the
hunting
train
,
and
be
at
the
inn
by
ten
.
<EOS>
the
meet
be
only
six
mile
distant
,
and
all
would
be
pleasant
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
this
whatever
may
be
the
result
of
his
work
to
-
day
;
 
but
in
the
meantime
he
would
go
and
do
his
work
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
cab
call
,
and
within
half
an
hour
of
the
time
at
which
he
have
leave
his
father
,
he
be
at
the
door
of
his
sister
's
house
in
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
the
servant
tell
him
that
the
lady
be
at
lunch
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
eat
lunch
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
tell
them
that
I
be
in
the
drawing
-
room

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
come
to
see
you
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
as
soon
as
the
servant
have
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not

that
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

but
I
do
say
it
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
have
not
come
to
see
me
;
 
that
is
,
not
to
see
me
specially
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
can
not
pretend
not
to
know
what
you
mean

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
think
it
civil
to
call
if
he
have
hear
that
you
be

Lady
Laura
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
if

I
will
be
civil

then
they
finish
their
lunch
,
and
Lady
Laura
get
up
and
lead
the
way
to
the
drawing

room

I

I

It

the
saviour
to
the

I

It

an
hour
ago
I

point

at

it
seem
to
her
that
he
be
all
eye

<EOS>
so
great
be
the
intensity

his
gaze

<EOS>
"
I
should
scorn

on
my

<EOS>
My
father
be
unreasonable

have
be
very
unjust
to
me

<EOS>
He
have
ever
believe
evil

believe
it
often

he
be
wrong

have
say
anything
severe
of
your
refusal
of
my
brother

I
retract
it
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
that
it
could
have
be
otherwise

<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
when
he
leave
his
sister
's
house
,
walk
through
the
slush
and
dirt
to
a
haunt
of
his
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Covent
Garden
,
and
there
he
remain
through
the
whole
afternoon
and
evening
.
<EOS>
a
certain
Captain
Clutterbuck
join
him
,
and
dine
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
tell
nothing
to
Captain
Clutterbuck
of
his
sorrow
,
but
Captain
Clutterbuck
could
see
that
he
be
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
's
have
another
bottle
of
"
cham
,
"
"
say
Captain
Clutterbuck
,
when
their
dinner

"
<EOS>
"
Cham

be
the
only
thing
to
screw
one
up
when
one
be
down
a
peg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
what
you
like
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
;
"
but
I
shall
have
some
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
bad
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
be
,
that
one
get
tired
of
it
before
the
night
be
over
,
"
say
Captain
Clutterbuck
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Lord
Chiltern
do
go
down
to
Peterborough
the
next
day
by
the
hunting
train
,
and
ride
his
horse
Bonebreaker
so
well
in
that
famous
run
from
Sutton
spring
to
gidde
that
after
the
run
young
Piles

of
the
house
of
Piles
,
Sarsnet
,
and
Gingham

offer
him
three
hundred
pound
for
the
animal
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
worth
above
fifty
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
give
you
the
three
hundred
,
"
say
Piles
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
not
ride
him
if
you
would
get
him
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
could
not
I
!
"
say
Piles
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Piles
do
not
continue
the
conversation
,
content
himself
with
tell
his
friend
Grogram
that
that
red
devil
Chiltern
be
as
drunk
as
a
lord
.
   
<EOS>
the
debate
on
the
ballot
 
Phineas
take
his
seat
in
the
House
with
a
consciousness
of
much
inward
trepidation
of
heart
on
that
night
of
the
ballot
debate
.
<EOS>
after
leave
Lord
Chiltern
he
go
down
to
his
club
and
dine
alone
.
<EOS>
three
or
four
man
come
and
speak
to
him
;
but
he
could
not
talk
to
them
at
his
ease
,
nor
do
he
quite
know
what
they
be
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
do
something
which
he
long
to
achieve
,
but
the
very
idea
of
which
,
now
that
it
be
so
near
to
him
,
be
a
terror
to
him
.
<EOS>
to
be
in
the
House
and
not
to
speak
would
,
to
his
thinking
,
be
a
disgraceful
failure
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
could
not
continue
to
keep
his
seat
unless
he
speak
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
put
there
that
he
may
speak
.
<EOS>
He
would
speak
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
would
speak
.
<EOS>
have
he
not
already
be
conspicuous
almost
as
a
boy
orator
?
<EOS>
and
yet
,
at
this
moment
he
do
not
know
whether
he
be
eat
mutton
or
beef
,
or
who
be
stand
opposite
to
him
and
talk
to
him
,
<EOS>
so
much
be
he
in
dread
of
the
ordeal
which
he
have
prepare
for
himself
.
<EOS>
as
he
go
down
to
the
House
after
dinner
,
he
almost
make
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
leave
London
by
one
of
the
night
mail
train
.
<EOS>
He
feel
himself
to
be
stiff
and
stilted
as
he
walk
,
and
that
his
clothe
be
uneasy
to
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
turn
into
Westminster
Hall
he
regret
more
keenly
than
ever
he
have
do
that
he
have
secede
from
the
keeping
of
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
he
think
,
have
speak
very
well
in
court
,
and
would
there
have
learn
that
self
-
confidence
which
now
fail
him
so
terribly
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
too
late
to
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
go
in
and
take
his
seat
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
in
and
take
his
seat
,
and
the
chamber
seem
to
him
to
be
mysteriously
large
,
as
though
bench
be
crowd
over
bench
,
and
gallery
over
gallery
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
long
enough
in
the
House
to
have
lose
the
original
awe
inspire
by
the
Speaker
and
the
clerk
of
the
House
,
by
the
row
of
Ministers
,
and
by
the
unequalled
importance
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
on
ordinary
occasion
he
could
saunter
in
and
out
,
and
whisper
at
his
ease
to
a
neighbour
.
<EOS>
but
on
this
occasion
he
go
direct
to
the
bench
on
which
he
ordinarily
sit
,
and
begin
at
once
to
rehearse
to
himself
his
speech
.
<EOS>
He
have
in
truth
be
do
this
all
day
,
in
spite
of
the
effort
that
he
have
make
to
rid
himself
of
all
memory
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
collect
the
head
of
his
speech
while
Mr.
Low
have
be
talk
to
him
,
and
refresh
his
quotation
in
the
presence
of
Lord
Chiltern
and
the
dumb
-
bell
.
<EOS>
He
have
tax
his
memory
and
his
intellect
with
various
task
,
which
,
as
he
fear
,
would
not
adjust
themselves
one
with
another
.
<EOS>
He
have
learn
the
heading
of
his
speech
,
 
so
that
one
head
may
follow
the
other
,
and
nothing
be
forget
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
learn
verbatim
the
word
which
he
intend
to
utter
under
each
head
,
 
with
a
hope
that
if
any
one
compact
part
should
be
destroy
or
injure
in
its
compactness
by
treachery
of
memory
,
or
by
the
course
of
the
debate
,
each
other
compact
part
may
be
there
in
its
entirety
,
ready
for
use
;
 
or
at
least
so
many
of
the
compact
part
as
treachery
of
memory
and
the
accident
of
the
debate
may
leave
to
him
;
so
that
his
speech
may
be
like
a
vessel
,
watertight
in
its
various
compartment
<EOS>
,
that
would
float
by
the
buoyancy
of
its
stern
and
bow
,
even
though
the
hold
should
be
waterlogge
.
<EOS>
but
this
use
of
his
compose
word
,
even
though
he
should
be
able
to
carry
it
through
,
would
not
complete
his
work
;
 
<EOS>
for
it
would
be
his
duty
to
answer
in
some
sort
those
who
have
go
before
him
,
and
in
order
to
do
this
he
must
be
able
to
insert
,
without
any
prearrangement
of
word
or
idea
,
little
intercalatory
part
between
those
compact
masse
of
argument
with
which
he
have
be
occupy
himself
for
many
laborious
hour
.
<EOS>
as
he
look
round
upon
the
House
and
perceive
that
everything
be
dim
before
him
,
that
all
his
original
awe
of
the
House
have
return
,
and
with
it
a
present
quake
fear
that
make
him
feel
the
pulsation
of
his
own
heart
,
he
become
painfully
aware
that
the
task
he
have
prepare
for
himself
be
too
great
.
<EOS>
He
should
,
on
this
the
occasion
of
his
rise
to
his
maiden
leg
,
have
either
prepare
for
himself
a
short
general
speech
,
which
could
indeed
have
do
little
for
his
credit
in
the
House
,
but
which
may
have
serve
to
carry
off
the
novelty
of
the
thing
,
and
have
introduce
him
to
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
within
those
wall
,
 
or
he
should
have
trust
to
what
his
wit
and
spirit
would
produce
for
him
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
and
not
have
burden
himself
with
a
huge
exercise
of
memory
.
<EOS>
during
the
presentation
of
a
few
petition
he
try
to
repeat
to
himself
the
first
of
his
compact
part
,
 
a
compact
part
on
which
,
as
it
may
certainly
be
bring
into
use
let
the
debate
have
go
as
it
may
,
he
have
expend
great
care
.
<EOS>
He
have
flatter
himself
that
there
be
something
of
real
strength
in
his
word
as
he
repeat
them
to
himself
in
the
comfortable
seclusion
of
his
own
room
,
and
he
have
make
them
so
ready
to
his
tongue
that
he
think
it
to
be
impossible
that
he
should
forget
even
an
intonation
.
<EOS>
now
he
find
that
he
could
not
remember
the
first
phrase
without
unloose
and
look
at
a
small
roll
of
paper
which
he
hold
furtively
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
good
of
look
at
it
?
<EOS>
He
would
forget
it
again
in
the
next
moment
.
<EOS>
He
have
intend
to
satisfy
the
most
eager
of
his
friend
,
and
to
astound
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
no
one
would
be
satisfied
,
 
and
none
astounded
but
they
who
have
trust
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
debate
begin
,
and
if
the
leisure
afford
by
a
long
and
tedious
speech
could
have
serve
him
,
he
may
have
have
leisure
enough
.
<EOS>
He
try
at
first
to
follow
all
that
this
advocate
for
the
ballot
may
say
,
hope
thence
to
acquire
the
impetus
of
strong
interest
;
but
he
soon
weary
of
the
work
,
and
begin
to
long
that
the
speech
may
be
end
,
although
the
period
of
his
own
martyrdom
would
thereby
be
bring
nearer
to
him
.
<EOS>
at
half
-
past
seven
<EOS>
so
many
member
have
desert
their
seat
,
that
Phineas
begin
to
think
that
he
may
be
save
all
further
pain
by
a
"
count
out
.
"
<EOS>
He
reckon
the
member
present
and
find
that
they
be
below
the
mystic
forty
,
 
first
by
two
,
then
by
four
,
by
five
,
by
seven
,
and
at
one
time
by
eleven
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
him
to
ask
the
Speaker
to
count
the
House
,
but
he
wonder
that
no
one
else
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
as
the
idea
of
this
termination
to
the
night
's
work
come
upon
him
,
and
as
he
think
of
his
lost
labour
,
he
almost
take
courage
again
,
 
almost
dread
rather
than
wish
for
the
interference
of
some
malicious
member
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
malicious
member
then
present
,
or
<EOS>
else
it
be
know
that
Lords
of
the
Treasury
and
Lords
of
the
Admiralty
would
flock
in
during
the
Speaker
's
ponderous
counting
,
 
and
thus
the
slow
length
of
the
ballot
-
lover
's
verbosity
be
permit
to
evolve
itself
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
at
eight
o'clock
he
have
complete
his
catalogue
of
illustration
,
and
immediately
Mr.
Monk
rise
from
the
Treasury
bench
to
explain
the
ground
on
which
the
Government
must
decline
to
support
the
motion
before
the
House
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
be
aware
that
Mr.
Monk
intend
to
speak
,
and
be
aware
also
that
his
speech
would
be
very
short
.
<EOS>
"
My
idea
be
,
"
he
have
say
to
Phineas
,
"
that
every
man
possess
of
the
franchise
should
dare
to
have
and
to
express
a
political
opinion
of
his
own
;
that
otherwise
the
franchise
be
not
worth
have
;
and
that
man
will
learn
that
when
all
so
dare
,
no
evil
can
come
from
such
daring
.
<EOS>
as
the
ballot
would
make
any
courage
of
that
kind
unnecessary
,
I
dislike
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
I
shall
confine
myself
to
that
,
and
leave
the
illustration
to
young
debater
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
also
have
be
inform
that
Mr.
Turnbull
would
reply
to
Mr.
Monk
,
with
the
purpose
of
crush
Mr.
Monk
into
dust
,
and
Phineas
have
prepare
his
speech
with
something
of
an
intention
of
subsequently
crush
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
however
,
that
he
could
not
command
his
opportunity
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
chapter
of
accident
to
which
he
must
accommodate
himself
;
but
such
have
be
his
programme
for
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
make
his
speech
,
 
and
though
he
be
short
,
he
be
very
fiery
and
energetic
.
<EOS>
quick
as
lightning
word
of
wrath
and
scorn
fly
from
him
,
in
which
he
paint
the
cowardice
,
the
meanness
,
the
falsehood
of
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
ballot
-
box
,
"
he
say
,
"
be
the
grave
of
all
true
political
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
though
he
speak
hardly
for
ten
minute
,
he
seem
to
say
more
than
enough
,
ten
time
enough
,
to
slaughter
the
argument
of
the
former
speaker
.
<EOS>
at
every
hot
word
as
it
fall
Phineas
be
drive
to
regret
that
a
paragraph
of
his
own
be
take
away
from
him
,
and
that
his
choice
morsel
of
stand
ground
be
be
cut
from
under
his
foot
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Monk
sit
down
,
Phineas
feel
that
Mr.
Monk
have
say
all
that
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
have
intend
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Turnbull
rise
slowly
from
the
bench
below
the
gangway
.
<EOS>
with
a
speaker
so
frequent
and
so
famous
as
Mr.
Turnbull
no
hurry
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
be
sure
to
have
his
opportunity
.
<EOS>
the
Speaker
's
eye
be
ever
travel
to
the
accustomed
spot
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
rise
slowly
and
begin
his
oration
very
mildly
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
he
admire
so
much
as
the
poetic
imagery
and
the
high
-
fly
sentiment
of
his
right
honourable
friend
the
member
for
West
Bromwich
,
"
 
Mr.
Monk
sit
for
West
Bromwich
,
 
"
unless
it
be
the
stubborn
fact
and
unanswered
argument
of
his
honourable
friend
who
have
bring
forward
this
motion
.
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Turnbull
proceed
after
his
fashion
to
crush
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
prosaic
,
very
clear
both
in
voice
and
language
,
very
harsh
,
and
very
unscrupulous
.
<EOS>
He
and
Mr.
Monk
have
be
join
together
in
politic
for
over
twenty
year
;
 
but
one
would
have
think
,
from
Mr.
Turnbull
's
word
,
that
they
have
be
the
bitter
of
enemy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
be
taunt
with
his
office
,
taunt
with
his
desertion
of
the
liberal
party
,
taunt
with
his
ambition
,
 
and
taunt
with
his
lack
of
ambition
.
<EOS>
"
I
once
think
,
"
say
Mr.
Turnbull
,
 
"
nay
,
not
long
ago
I
think
,
that
he
and
I
would
have
fight
this
battle
for
the
people
,
shoulder
to
shoulder
,
and
knee
to
knee
;
 
but
he
have
prefer
that
the
knee
next
to
his
own
shall
wear
a
garter
,
and
that
the
shoulder
which
support
him
shall
be
deck
with
a
blue
ribbon
,
 
as
shoulder
,
I
presume
,
be
deck
in
those
closet
conference
which
be
call
cabinet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
just
after
this
,
while
Mr.
Turnbull
be
still
go
on
with
a
variety
of
illustration
draw
from
the
United
States
,
Barrington
Erle
step
across
the
bench
up
to
the
place
where
Phineas
be
sit
,
and
whisper
a
few
word
into

"
Bonteen
be
prepared
to
answer
Turnbull
,
and
wish
to
do
it

I
tell
him
that
I
think
you
should
have
the
opportunity

if
you

it

Phineas
be
not
ready
with
a
reply
to
Erle
at
the
spur
of
the
moment

"
somebody
tell
me
,

continue
Erle
,
"
that
you
have
say
that
you
would
like
to
speak
to
-
night

so
I
do

say
Phineas

<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
Bonteen
that
you
will
do
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
chamber
seem
to
swim
round
before
our
hero
's
eye
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
be
still
go
on
with
his
clear
,
loud
,
unpleasant
voice
,
but
there
be
no
know
how
long
he
may
go
on
.
<EOS>
upon
Phineas
,
if
he
should
now
consent
,
may
devolve
the
duty
,
within
ten
minute
,
within
three
minute
,
of
rise
there
before
a
full
House
to
defend
his
great
friend
,
Mr.
Monk
,
from
a
gross
personal
attack
.
<EOS>
be
it
fit
that
such
a
novice
as
he
should
undertake
such
a
work
as
that
?
<EOS>
be
he
to
do
so
,
all
that
speech
which
he
have
prepare
,
with
its
various
self
-
float
part
,
must
go
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
task
be
exactly
that
which
,
of
all
task
,
he
would
best
like
to
have
accomplish
,
and
to
have
accomplish
well
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
should
fail
!
<EOS>
and
he
feel
that
he
would
fail
.
<EOS>
for
such
work
a
man
should
have
all
his
sense
about
him
,
 
his
full
courage
,
perfect
confidence
,
something
almost
approach
to
contempt
for
listen
opponent
,
and
nothing
of
fear
in
regard
to
listening
friend
.
<EOS>
He
should
be
as
a
cock
in
his
own
farmyard
,
master
of
all
the
circumstance
around
him
.
<EOS>
but
Phineas
Finn
have
not
even
as
yet
hear
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
in
that
room
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
,
so
confused
be
he
,
that
he
do
not
know
where
sit
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
where
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
.
<EOS>
all
be
confused
,
and
there
arise
as
it
be
a
sound
of
water
in
his
ear
,
and
a
feeling
as
of
a
great
hell
around
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
rather
wait
,
"
he
say
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
Bonteen
have
well
reply
.
"
Barrington
Erle
look
into
his
face
,
and
then
step
back
across
the
bench
,
tell
Mr.
Bonteen
that
the
opportunity
be
his
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
continue
speak
quite
long
enough
to
give
poor
Phineas
time
for
repentance
;
but
repentance
be
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
He
have
decide
against
himself
,
and
his
decision
could
not
be
reverse
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
leave
the
House
,
only
it
seem
to
him
that
have
he
do
so
every
one
would
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
draw
his
hat
down
over
his
eye
,
and
remain
in
his
place
,
hate
Mr.
Bonteen
,
hate
Barrington
Erle
,
hate
Mr.
Turnbull
,
 
but
hate
no
one
so
much
as
he
hate
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
disgrace
himself
for
ever
and
could
never
recover
the
occasion
which
he
have
lose
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
's
speech
be
in
no
way
remarkable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
,
he
say
,
have
do
the
State
good
service
by
add
his
wisdom
and
patriotism
to
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
the
sort
of
argument
which
Mr.
Bonteen
use
to
prove
that
a
man
who
have
gain
credit
as
a
legislator
should
in
process
of
time
become
a
member
of
the
executive
,
be
trite
and
common
,
and
be
not
use
by
Mr.
Bonteen
with
any
special
force
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
be
glib
of
tongue
and
possess
that
familiarity
with
the
place
which
poor
Phineas
have
lack
so
sorely
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
moment
,
however
,
which
be
terrible
to
Phineas
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Mr.
Bonteen
have
show
the
purpose
for
which
he
be
on
his
leg
,
Mr.
Monk
look
round
at
Phineas
,
as
though
in
reproach
.
<EOS>
He
have
expect
that
this
work
should
fall
into
the
hand
of
one
who
would
perform
it
with
more
warmth
of
heart
than
could
be
expect
from
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Bonteen
cease
,
two
or
three
other
short
speech
be
make
and
member
fire
off
their
little
gun
.
<EOS>
phinea
have
lose
so
great
an
opportunity
,
would
not
now
consent
to
accept
one
that
should
be
comparatively
valueless
.
<EOS>
then
there
come
a
division
.
<EOS>
the
motion
be
lose
by
a
large
majority
,
 
by
any
number
you
may
choose
to
name
,
as
Phineas
have
say
to
Lord
Brentford
;
but
in
that
there
be
no
triumph
to
the
poor
wretch
who
have
fail
through
fear
,
and
who
be
now
a
coward
in
his
own
esteem
.
  
<EOS>
He
leave
the
House
alone
,
carefully
avoid
all
speech
with
any
one
.
<EOS>
as
he
come
out
he
have
see
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
in
the
lobby
,
but
he
have
go
on
without
pause
a
moment
,
so
that
he
may
avoid
his
friend
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
be
out
in
Palace
Yard
,
where
be
he
to
go
next
?
<EOS>
He
look
at
his
watch
,
and
find
that
it
be
just
ten
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
dare
to
go
to
his
club
,
and
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
go
home
and
to
bed
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
miserable
,
and
nothing
would
comfort
him
but
sympathy
.
<EOS>
be
there
any
one
who
would
listen
to
his
abuse
of
himself
,
and
would
then
answer
him
with
kindly
apology
for
his
own
weakness
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunce
would
do
it
if
she
know
how
,
but
sympathy
from
Mrs.
Bunce
would
hardly
avail
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
person
in
the
world
to
whom
he
could
tell
his
own
humiliation
with
any
hope
of
comfort
,
and
that
person
be
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
sympathy
from
any
man
would
have
be
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
for
a
moment
of
fling
himself
at
Mr.
Monk
's
foot
and
tell
all
his
weakness
;
 
but
he
could
not
have
endure
pity
even
from
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
endure
from
any
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
think
that
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
would
be
at
home
,
and
probably
alone
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
at
any
rate
,
that
he
may
be
allow
to
knock
at
her
door
,
even
at
that
hour
.
<EOS>
He
have
leave
Mr.
Kennedy
in
the
House
,
and
there
he
would
probably
remain
for
the
next
hour
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
man
more
constant
than
Mr.
Kennedy
in
see
the
work
of
the
day
,
 
or
of
the
night
,
 
to
its
end
.
<EOS>
so
Phineas
walk
up
Victoria
Street
,
and
from
thence
into
Grosvenor
Place
,
and
knock
at
Lady
Laura
's
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
Lady
Laura
be
at
home
;
and
alone
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
show
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
there
he
find
Lady
Laura
wait
for
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
the
great
debate
be
over
,
"
she
say
,
with
as
much
of
irony
as
she
know
how
to
throw
into
the
epithet
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
it
be
over
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
what
have
they
do
,
 
those
leviathan
of
the
people
?
"
  
<EOS>
then
Phineas
tell
her
what
be
the
majority
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
anything
the
matter
with
you
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
look
at
him
suddenly
.
"
<EOS>
be
you
not
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
be
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
you
not
sit
down
?
<EOS>
there
be
something
wrong
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
simply
be
the
great
idiot
,
the
great
coward
,
the
most
awkward
ass
that
ever
live
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
come
to
tell
you
of
it
at
this
hour
at
night
,
but
I
have
come
that
I
may
tell
you
.
<EOS>
probably
because
there
be
no
one
else
in
the
whole
world
who
would
not
laugh
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
,
I
shall
not
laugh
at
you
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
despise
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
I
be
sure
I
shall
not
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
despise
myself
.
<EOS>
for
year
I
have
place
before
myself
the
ambition
of
speak
in
the
House
of
Commons
;
 
for
year
I
have
be
think
whether
there
would
ever
come
to
me
an
opportunity
of
make
myself
hear
in
that
assembly
,
which
I
consider
to
be
the
first
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
the
opportunity
have
be
offer
to
me
,
 
and
,
though
the
motion
be
nothing
,
the
opportunity
be
great
.
<EOS>
the
subject
be
one
on
which
I
be
thoroughly
prepare
.
<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
I
be
summon
be
most
flattering
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
especially
call
on
to
perform
a
task
which
be
most
congenial
to
my
feeling
;
 
and
I
decline
because
I
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
think
too
much
about
it
,
my
friend
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
too
much
or
too
little
,
what
do
it
matter
?
"
<EOS>
reply
Phineas
,
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
do
you
remember
the
story
of
Conachar
in
the
"
Fair
Maid
of
Perth
;
"
 
how
his
heart
refuse
to
give
him
blood
enough
to
fight
?
<EOS>
He
have
be
suckle
with
the
milk
of
a
timid
creature
,
and
,
though
he
could
die
,
there
be
none
of
the
strength
of
manhood
in
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
the
same
thing
with
me
,
I
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
be
at
all
like
Conachar
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
equally
disgrace
,
and
I
must
perish
after
the
same
fashion
.
<EOS>
I
shall
apply
for
the
Chiltern
Hundreds
in
a
day
or
two

<EOS>
"
You
will
do
nothing
of

kind

Lady
Laura

get
up
from
her
chair

come
towards
him
.

You
shall
not
leave
this
room

you
have
promise
me

I
do
not
know
as
yet
<EOS>
what
have
occur
to
-
night
;

I
do
know
that
that
modesty
which
have
keep
you
silent
be
more
often
a
grace
than
a
disgrace

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
kind
of
sympathy
which
he
want
,
She
draw
her
chair
nearer
to
him
,
and
then
he
explain
to
her
as
accurately
as
he
could
what
have
take
place
in
the
House
on
this
evening
,
 
how
he
have
prepare
his
speech
,
how
he
have
feel
that
his
preparation
be
vain
,
how
he
perceive
from
the
course
of
the
debate
that
if
he
speak
at
all
his
speech
must
be
very
different
from
what
he
have
first
intend
;
how
he
have
decline
to
take
upon
himself
a
task
which
seem
to
require
so
close
a
knowledge
of
the
way
of
the
House
and
of
the
temper
of
the
man
,
as
the
defence
of
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
in
accuse
himself
he
,
unconsciously
,
excuse
himself
,
and
his
excuse
,
in
Lady
Laura
's
ear
,
be
more
valid
than
his
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
would
give
it
all
up
for
that
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
I
think
I
ought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
very
little
doubt
but
that
you
be
right
in
allow
Mr.
Bonteen
to
undertake
such
a
task
.
<EOS>
I
should
simply
explain
to
Mr.
Monk
that
you
feel
too
keen
an
interest
in
his
welfare
to
stand
up
as
an
untried
member
in
his
defence
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
I
think
,
the
work
for
a
man
who
be
not
at
home
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
Mr.
Monk
will
feel
this
,
and
I
be
quite
certain
that
Mr.
Kennedy
will
think
that
you
have
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
what
Mr.
Kennedy
may
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
say
that
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
that
be
not
courteous
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
simply
because
I
care
so
much
what
Mr.
Kennedy
's
wife
may
think
.
<EOS>
Your
opinion
be
all
in
all
to
me
,
 
only
that
I
know
you
be
too
kind
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
not
be
too
kind
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
be
never
too
kind
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
He
be
justice
itself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
hear
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
could
not
but
feel
that
there
be
in
Lady
Laura
's
word
something
of
an
accusation
against
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
justice
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
justice
would
condemn
me
.
<EOS>
but
love
and
friendship
know
nothing
of
justice
.
<EOS>
the
value
of
love
be
that
it
overlook
fault
,
and
forgive
even
crime
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
at
any
rate
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
"
will
forgive
the
crime
of
your
silence
in
the
House

<EOS>
My
strong
belief
in
your
success
will
not
be
in
the
least
affect
by
what
you
tell
me
of
your
failure
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
You
must
await
another
opportunity
;
and
,
if
possible
,
you
should
be
less
anxious
as
to
your
own
performance
.
<EOS>
there
be
Violet
.
"
<EOS>
as
Lady
Laura
speak
the
last
word
,
there
be
a
sound
of
a
carriage
stop
in
the
street
,
and
the
front
door
be
immediately
open

<EOS>
"
She
be
stay
here

have
be
dine
with
her
uncle

Admiral
Effingham

<EOS>
then
Violet
Effingham
enter
the
room
,
roll
up
in
pretty
white
fur
,
and
silk
cloak
,
and
lace
shawl
.

here

remember

on

<EOS>
"
Poor

<EOS>
after
that
Phineas
go
,
not
wish
to
await
the
return
of
Mr.

.
<EOS>
He
have
feel
that
Violet
Effingham
have
come
into
the
room
just
in
time
to
remedy
a
great
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
wish
to
speak
of
his
love
to
a
married
woman
,
 
to
the
wife
of
the
man
who
call
him
friend
,
 
to
a
woman
who
he
feel
sure
would
have
rebuke
him

but
he
could
hardly
have
restrain
himself
have
not
Miss
Effingham
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
he
go
home
he
think
more
of
Miss
Effingham
than
he
do
of
Lady
Laura
;
and
I
think
that
the
voice
of
Miss
Effingham
have
do
almost
as
much
towards
comfort
him
as
have
the
kindness
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
have
be
comfort
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
be
punctual
"
 
<EOS>
on
the
very
morning
after
his
failure
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
when
Phineas
be
read
in
the
_
Telegraph
_
,
 
he
take
the
_
Telegraph
_
not
from
choice
but
for
economy
,
 
the
word
of
that
debate
which
he
have
hear
and
in
which
he
should
have
take
a
part
,
a
most
unwelcome
visit
be
pay
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
near
eleven
,
and
the
breakfast
thing
be
still
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
this
time
on
a
Committee
of
the
House
with
reference
to
the
use
of
potted
pea
in
the
army
and
navy
,
at
which
he
have
sit
once
,
 
at
a
preliminary
meeting
,
 
and
in
reference
to
which
he
have
already
resolve
that
as
he
have
fail
so
frightfully
in
debate
,
he
would
certainly
do
his
duty
to
the
utmost
in
the
more
easy
but
infinitely
more
tedious
work
of
the
Committee
Room
.
<EOS>
the
Committee
meet
at
twelve
,
and
he
intend
to
walk
down
to
the
Reform
Club
,
and
then
to
the
House
.
<EOS>
He
have
just
complete
his
reading
of
the
debate
and
of
the
leader
in
the
_
Telegraph
_
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
himself
how
little
the
writer
of
the
article
know
about
Mr.
Turnbull
,
how
little
about
Mr.
Monk
,
and
how
little
about
the
people
,
 
such
be
his
own
idea
as
to
the
qualification
of
the
writer
of
that
lead
article
,
 
and
be
about
to
start
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Bunce
arrest
him
by
tell
him
that
there
be
a
man
below
who
want
to
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
sort
of
a
man
,
Mrs.
Bunce
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
a
gentleman
,
sir

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
give
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
,
sir
;
<EOS>
but
I
know
it
be
about
money
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
way
of
them
<EOS>
so
well
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
this
one
's
face
before
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
show
him
up
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
He
know
well
the
business
on
which
the
man
be
come
.
<EOS>
the
man
want
money
for
that
bill
which
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
have
send
afloat
,
and
which
Phineas
have
endorse
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
never
as
yet
fall
so
deeply
into
trouble
of
money
as
to
make
it
necessary
that
he
need
refuse
himself
to
any
caller
on
that
score
,
and
he
do
not
choose
to
do
so
now
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
most
heartily
wish
that
he
have
leave
his
lodging
for
the
club
before
the
man
have
come
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
first
he
have
hear
of
the
bill
be
overdue
and
unpaid
.
<EOS>
the
bill
have
be
bring
to
him
note
a
month
since
,
and
then
he
have
simply
tell
the
youth
who
bring
it
that
he
would
see
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
and
have
the
matter
settle
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
to
his
friend
Laurence
,
and
Laurence
have
simply
assure
him
that
all
should
be
make
right
in
two
day
,
 
or
,
at
furthest
,
by
the
end
of
a
week
.
<EOS>
since
that
time
he
have
observe
that
his
friend
have
be
somewhat
shy
of
speak
to
him
when
no
other
be
with
them
.
<EOS>
Phineas
would
not
have
allude
to
the
bill
have
he
and
Laurence
be
alone
together
;
but
he
have
be
quick
enough
to
guess
from
his
friend
's
manner
that
the
matter
be
not
settle
.
<EOS>
now
,
no
doubt
,
serious
trouble
be
about
to
commence
.
  
<EOS>
the
visitor
be
a
little
man
with
grey
hair
and
a
white
cravat
,
some
sixty
year
of
age
,
dress
in
black
,
with
a
very
decent
hat
,
 
which
,
on
enter
the
room
,
he
at
once
put
down
on
the
near
chair
,
 
with
reference
to
whom
,
any
judge
on
the
subject
would
have
concur
at
first
sight
in
the
decision
pronounce
by
Mrs.
Bunce
,
though
none
but
a
judge
very
well
used
to
sift
the
cause
of
his
own
conclusion
could
have
give
the
reason
for
that
early
decision
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
gentleman
,
"
Mrs.
Bunce
have
say
.
<EOS>
and
the
man
certainly
be
not
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
in
the
white
cravat
be
very
neatly
dress
,
and
carry
himself
without
any
of
that
humility
which
betray
one
class
of
uncertified
aspirant
to
gentility
,
or
of
that
assumed
arrogance
which
be
at
once
fatal
to
another
class
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
Mrs.
Bunce
have
see
at
a
glance
that
he
be
not
a
gentleman
,
 
have
see
,
moreover
,
that
such
a
man
could
have
come
only
upon
one
mission
.
<EOS>
She
be
right
there
too
.
<EOS>
this
visitor
have
come
about
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
this
bill
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
say
the
visitor
,
proceed
to
take
out
of
his
breast
coat
-
pocket
a
rather
large
leathern
case
,
as
he
advance
up
towards
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
My
name
be
Clarkson
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
if
I
may
venture
so
far
,
I
will
take
a
chair
.

"
  
"
certainly
,
Mr.

Phineas

get
up
and

?
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
horrid
little
man
draw
himself
close
in
to
the
fire
,
and
spread
out
his
leathern
case
upon
his
knee
,
begin
to
turn
over
one
suspicious
bit
of
paper
after
another
,
as
though
he
be
uncertain
in
what
part
of
his
portfolio
lie
this
identical
bit
which
he
be
seek
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
quite
at
home
,
and
to
feel
that
there
be
no
ground
whatever
for
hurry
in
such
comfortable
quarter
.
<EOS>
Phineas
hate
him
at
once
,
 
with
a
hatred
altogether
unconnected
with
the
difficulty
which
his
friend
Fitzgibbon
have
bring
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
it
be

Mr.

at
last

should
go
down
to
his
Committee

but
Mr.
Clarkson
do
not
get
up
from
his
seat

<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
I
must
ask
you
to
leave
me
now
,
Mr.
Clarkson
,
as
I
have
business
down
at
the
House

Mr.

that
be
the
good
of
Parliament

<EOS>
I
have
know
Parliament
gent
this
thirty
year
and
more

Would
you
believe
it
 
<EOS>
I
have
have
a
Prime
Minister

name
in

portfolio

that
I
have
;

a
Lord
Chancellor

that
I
have

I

off

"
  
<EOS>
there
he
sit
before
the
fire
with
his
pouch
open
before
him
,
and
Phineas
have
no
power
of
move
him
.
<EOS>
Could
Phineas
have
pay
him
the
money
which
be
manifestly
due
to
him
on
the
bill
,
the
man
would
of
course
have
go
;
but
fail
in
that
,
Phineas
could
not
turn
him
out
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
black
cloud
on
the
young
member
's
brow
,
and
great
anger
at
his
heart
,
 
against
Fitzgibbon
rather
than
against
the
man
who
be
sit
there
before
him

"
<EOS>
Sir
,
"
he
say
,
"
it
be
really
imperative
that
I
should
go

<EOS>
I
be
pledge
to
an
appointment
at
the
House

twelve
,
and
it
want
now
only
a
quarter
.
<EOS>
I
regret
that
your
interview
with
me
should
be
so
unsatisfactory

but
I
can
only
promise
you
that
I
will
see
Mr.

"
  
"
and
when
shall
I
call
again

Mr.

"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
have
better
write
to
you

Phineas

"
oh
dear
,
no
,
"
say
Mr.

<EOS>
"
I
should
much
prefer
to
look

look

be
always
good

We
can
get
to
understand
one
another
in

<EOS>
let
me
see
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
you
be
not
particular
.
<EOS>
suppose
I
say
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
really
,
I
could
not
see
you
on

Mr.

"
parliament

be
not
generally
particular

"
speciaily

plead
Mr.

<EOS>
"
I
be
always

we

Monday

Tuesday

<EOS>
Tuesday
morning
at
eleven

<EOS>
and
do
be
punctual
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
at
Tuesday
morning
I
will
come
,
and
then
no

I
shall
find
you
ready

"
<EOS>
Whereupon
Mr.
Clarkson
slowly
put
up
his
bill
within
his
portfolio
,
and
then
,
before
Phineas
know
where
he
be
,
have
warmly
shake
that
poor
dismay
member
of
Parliament
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
only
do
be
punctual
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
make
his
way
down
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
twelve
,
and
Phineas
rush
off
to
a
cab
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
such
a
fervour
of
rage
and
misery
that
he
could
hardly
think
of
his
position
,
or
what
he
have
better
do
,
till
he
get
into
the
Committee
Room
;
and
when
there
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
He
intend
to
go
deeply
into
the
question
of
potted
pea
,
hold
an
equal
balance
between
the
assailed
Government
office
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
advocate
of
the
pot
pea
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
the
potter
of
the
pea
,
who
want
to
sell
their
article
to
the
Crown
,
declare
that
an
extensive
,
 
perhaps
we
may
say
,
an
unlimited
,
 
use
of
the
article
would
save
the
whole
army
and
navy
from
the
scourge
of
scurvy
,
dyspepsia
,
and
rheumatism
,
would
be
the
good
safeguard
against
typhus
and
other
fever
,
and
would
be
an
invaluable
aid
in
all
other
malady
to
which
soldier
and
sailor
be
peculiarly
subject
.
<EOS>
the
pea
in
question
be
grow
on
a
large
scale
in
Holstein
,
and
their
growth
have
be
foster
with
the
special
object
of
do
good
to
the
british
army
and
navy
.
<EOS>
the
pea
be
so
cheap
that
there
would
be
a
great
saving
in
money
,
 
and
it
really
have
seem
to
many
that
the
official
of
the
Horse
Guards
and
the
Admiralty
have
be
actuate
by
some
fiendish
desire
to
deprive
their
man
of
salutary
fresh
vegetable
,
simply
because
they
be
of
foreign
growth
.
<EOS>
but
the
official
of
the
War
Office
and
the
Admiralty
declare
that
the
pot
pea
in
question
be
hardly
fit
for
swine
.
<EOS>
the
motion
for
the
Committee
have
be
make
by
a
gentleman
of
the
opposition
,
and
Phineas
have
be
put
upon
it
as
an
independent
member
.
<EOS>
He
have
resolve
to
give
it
all
his
mind
,
and
,
as
far
as
he
be
concern
,
to
reach
a
just
decision
,
in
which
there
should
be
no
favour
show
to
the
Government
side
.
<EOS>
new
broom
be
proverbial
for
thorough
work
,
and
in
this
Committee
work
Phineas
be
as
yet
a
new
broom
.
<EOS>
but
,
unfortunately
,
on
this
day
his
mind
be
so
harass
that
he
could
hardly
understand
what
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
,
perhaps
,
much
signify
,
as
the
witness
examine
be
altogether
agricultural
.
<EOS>
They
only
prove
the
production
of
pea
in
Holstein
,
 
a
fact
as
to
which
Phineas
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
the
proof
be
naturally
slow
,
as
the
evidence
be
give
in
German
,
and
have
to
be
translate
into
English
.
<EOS>
and
the
work
of
the
day
be
much
impede
by
a
certain
member
who
unfortunately
speak
German
,
who
seem
to
be
fond
of
speak
german
before
his
brother
of
the
Committee
,
and
who
be
curious
as
to
agriculture
in
Holstein
generally
.
<EOS>
the
chairman
do
not
understand
german
,
and
there
be
a
difficulty
in
check
this
gentleman
,
and
in
make
him
understand
that
his
question
be
not
relevant
to
the
issue
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
could
not
keep
his
mind
during
the
whole
afternoon
from
the
subject
of
his
misfortune
.
<EOS>
what
should
he
do
if
this
horrid
man
come
to
him
once
or
twice
a
week
?
<EOS>
He
certainly
do
owe
the
man
the
money
.
<EOS>
He
must
admit
that
to
himself
.
<EOS>
the
man
no
doubt
be
a
dishonest
knave
who
have
discount
the
bill
probably
at
fifty
per
cent
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
Phineas
have
make
himself
legally
responsible
for
the
amount
.
<EOS>
the
privilege
of
the
House
prohibit
him
from
arrest
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
that
very
often
,
but
the
thought
only
make
him
the
more
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
say
,
and
may
it
not
be
say
truly
,
that
he
have
incur
this
responsibility
,
 
a
responsibility
which
he
be
altogether
unequal
to
answer
,
 
because
he
be
so
protect
?
<EOS>
He
do
feel
that
a
certain
consciousness
of
his
privilege
have
be
present
to
him
when
he
have
put
his
name
across
the
paper
,
and
there
have
be
dishonesty
in
that
very
consciousness
.
<EOS>
and
of
what
service
would
his
privilege
be
to
him
,
if
this
man
could
harass
every
hour
of
his
life
?
<EOS>
the
man
be
to
be
with
him
again
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
when
the
appointment
have
be
propose
,
he
,
Phineas
,
have
not
dare
to
negative
it
.
<EOS>
and
how
be
he
to
escape
?
<EOS>
as
for
pay
the
bill
,
that
with
him
be
altogether
impossible
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
tell
him
,
 
and
he
have
believe
the
man
,
 
that
payment
by
Fitzgibbon
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
and
yet
Fitzgibbon
be
the
son
of
a
peer
,
whereas
he
be
only
the
son
of
a
country
doctor
!
<EOS>
of
course
Fitzgibbon
must
make
some
effort
,
 
some
great
effort
,
 
and
have
the
thing
settle
.
<EOS>
alas
,
alas
!
<EOS>
He
know
enough
of
the
world
already
to
feel
that
the
hope
be
vain
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
down
from
the
Committee
Room
into
the
House
,
and
he
dine
at
the
House
,
and
remain
there
until
eight
or
nine
at
night
;
but
Fitzgibbon
do
not
come
.
<EOS>
He
then
go
to
the
Reform
Club
,
but
he
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
both
at
the
club
and
in
the
House
many
man
speak
to
him
about
the
debate
of
the
previous
night
,
express
surprise
that
he
have
not
speak
,
 
make
him
more
and
more
wretched
.
<EOS>
He
see
Mr.
Monk
,
but
Mr.
Monk
be
walk
arm
in
arm
with
his
colleague
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
Phineas
could
do
no
more
than
just
speak
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
Mr.
Monk
's
nod
of
recognition
be
very
cold
.
<EOS>
that
may
be
fancy
,
but
it
certainly
be
a
fact
that
Mr.
Monk
only
nod
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
tell
Mr.
Monk
the
truth
,
and
then
,
if
Mr.
Monk
choose
to
quarrel
with
him
,
he
at
any
rate
would
take
no
step
to
renew
their
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
Reform
Club
he
go
to
the
Shakspeare
,
a
small
club
to
which
Fitzgibbon
belong
,
 
and
of
which
Phineas
much
wish
to
become
a
member
,
 
and
to
which
he
know
that
his
friend
resort
when
he
wish
to
enjoy
himself
thoroughly
,
and
to
be
at
ease
in
his
inn
.
<EOS>
man
at
the
Shakspeare
could
do
as
they
please
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
politic
there
,
no
fashion
,
no
stiffness
,
and
no
rule
,
 
so
man
say
;
but
that
be
hardly
true
.
<EOS>
everybody
call
everybody
by
his
christian
name
,
and
member
smoke
all
over
the
house
.
<EOS>
They
who
do
not
belong
to
the
Shakspeare
think
it
an
Elysium
upon
earth
;
and
they
who
do
,
believe
it
to
be
among
pandemonium
the
most
pleasant
.
<EOS>
phineas
call
at
the
Shakspeare
,
and
be
tell
by
the
porter
that
Mr.
Fitzgibbon

He

in
five
minute

have
come

Violet
to

Lord

Violet
frequently
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
give
periodical
dinner
,
 
once
a
week
,
 
to
which
everybody
go
who
could
get
an
invitation
;
and
Phineas
have
be
a
guest
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
in
spite
of
his
misery
he
have
take
to
dine
out
a
good
deal
,
and
be
popular
as
an
eater
of
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
could
talk
when
want
,
and
do
not
talk
too
much
,
be
pleasant
in
manner
and
appearance
,
and
have
already
achieve
a
certain
recognise
position
in
London
life
.
<EOS>
of
those
who
know
him
intimately
,
not
one
in
twenty
be
aware
from
whence
<EOS>
he
come
,
what
be
his
parentage
,
or
what
his
mean
of
living
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
member
of
Parliament
,
a
friend
of
Mr.
Kennedy
's
,
be
intimate
with
Mr.
Monk
,
though
an
Irishman
do
not
as
a
rule
herd
with
other
Irishmen
,
and
be
the
right
sort
of
person
to
have
at
your
house
.
<EOS>
some
people
say
he
be
a
cousin
of
Lord
Brentford
's
,
and
other
declare
that
he
be
Lord
Chiltern
's
early
friend
.
<EOS>
there
he
be
,
however
,
with
a
position
gain
,
and
even
Lady
Baldock
ask
him
to
her
house
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
have
evening
.
<EOS>
People
go
to
her
house
,
and
stand
about
the
room
and
on
the
stair
,
talk
to
each
other
for
half
an
hour
,
and
go
away
.
<EOS>
in
these
March
day
there
be
no
crowding
,
but
still
there
be
always
enough
of
people
there
to
show
that
Lady
Baldock
be
successful
.
<EOS>
why
people
should
have
go
to
Lady
Baldock
's
<EOS>
I
can
not
explain
;
 
but
there
be
house
to
which
people
go
without
any
reason
.
<EOS>
Phineas
receive
a
little
card
ask
him
to
go
,
and
he
always
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
like
my
friend
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
Lady
Laura
say
to
Miss
Effingham
,
after
the
first
of
these
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
like
him
decidedly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
do
I.
I
should
hardly
have
think
that
you
would
have
take
a
fancy
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
what
you
call
take
a
fancy
,
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
quite
sure
I
like
to
be
tell
that
I
have
take
a
fancy
for
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
no
offence
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
do
not
but
,
to
speak
truth
,
I
think
I
have
rather
take
a
fancy
to
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
just
enough
of
him
,
but
not
too
much
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
materially
,
 
in
regard
to
his
inch
;
but
as
to
his
mental
belonging
.
<EOS>
I
hate
a
stupid
man
who
can
not
talk
to
me
,
and
I
hate
a
clever
man
who
talk
me
down
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
a
man
who
be
too
lazy
to
make
any
effort
to
shine
;
but
I
particularly
dislike
the
man
who
be
always
strive
for
effect
.
<EOS>
I
abominate
a
humble
man
,
but
yet
I
love
to
perceive
that
a
man
acknowledge
the
superiority
of
my
sex
,
and
youth
,
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
be
flatter
without
plain
flattery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
do
.
<EOS>
a
man
who
would
tell
me
that
I
be
pretty
,
unless
he
be
over
seventy
,
ought
to
be
kick
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
but
a
man
who
can
not
show
me
that
he
think
me
so
without
say
a
word
about
it
,
be
a
lout
.
<EOS>
now
in
all
those
matter
,
your
friend
,
Mr.
Finn
,
seem
to
know
what
he
be
about
.
<EOS>
in
other
word
,
he
make
himself
pleasant
,
and
,
therefore
,
one
be
glad
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
do
not
mean
to
fall
in
love
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
that
I
know
of
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
do
,
I
will
be
sure
to
give
you
notice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
fear
that
there
be
more
of
earnestness
in
Lady
Laura
's
last
question
than
Miss
Effingham
have
suppose
.
<EOS>
She
have
declare
to
herself
over
and
over
again
that
she
have
never
be
in
love
with
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
She
have
acknowledge
to
herself
,
before
Mr.
Kennedy
have
ask
her
hand
in
marriage
,
that
there
have
be
danger
,
 
that
she
could
have
learn
to
love
the
man
if
such
love
would
not
have
be
ruinous
to
her
,
 
that
the
romance
of
such
a
passion
would
have
be
pleasant
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
go
farther
than
this
,
and
have
say
to
herself
that
she
would
have
give
way
to
that
romance
,
and
would
have
be
ready
to
accept
such
love
if
offer
to
her
,
<EOS>
have
she
not
put
it
out
of
her
own
power
to
marry
a
poor
man
by
her
generosity
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
then
she
have
thrust
the
thing
aside
,
and
have
clearly
understand
,
 
she
think
that
she
have
clearly
understand
,
 
that
life
for
her
must
be
a
matter
of
business
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
the
case
with
nine
out
of
every
ten
among
mankind
,
with
nine
hundred
and
ninety
-
nine
out
of
every
thousand
,
that
life
must
be
a
matter
of
business
and
not
of
romance
?
<EOS>
of
course
she
could
not
marry
Mr.
Finn
,
know
,
as
she
do
,
that
neither
of
them
have
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
of
all
man
in
the
world
she
esteem
Mr.
Kennedy
the
most
,
and
when
these
thought
be
pass
through
her
mind
,
she
be
well
aware
that
he
would
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
have
she
not
resolve
that
she
would
accept
the
offer
,
she
would
not
have
go
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
have
put
aside
all
romance
as
unfitted
to
her
life
,
she
could
,
she
think
,
do
her
duty
as
Mr.
Kennedy
's
wife
.
<EOS>
She
would
teach
herself
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
nay
,
 
she
have
teach
herself
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
at
any
rate
so
sure
of
her
own
heart
that
she
would
never
give
her
husband
cause
to
rue
the
confidence
he
place
in
her
.
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
something
sore
within
her
when
she
think
that
Phineas
Finn
be
fond
of
Violet
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
Lady
Baldock
's
second
evening
,
and
Phineas
come
to
the
house
at
about
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
at
this
time
he
have
encounter
a
second
and
a
third
interview
with
Mr.
Clarkson
,
and
have
already
fail
in
obtain
any
word
of
comfort
from
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
about
the
bill
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
enough
now
that
Laurence
feel
that
they
be
both
make
safe
by
their
privilege
,
and
that
Mr.
Clarkson
should
be
treat
as
you
treat
the
organ
-
grinder
.
<EOS>
They
be
a
nuisance
and
must
be
endure
.
<EOS>
but
the
nuisance
be
not
so
great
<EOS>
but
what
you
can
live
in
comfort
,
 
if
only
you
be
not
too
sore
as
to
the
annoyance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
Laurence
have
say
to
him
,
"
I
have
have
Clarkson
almost
live
in
my
room
.
<EOS>
He
use
to
drink
nearly
a
pint
of
sherry
a
day
for
me
.
<EOS>
all
I
look
to
be
that
I
do
not
live
there
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
if
you
wish
it
,
I
will
send
in
the
sherry
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
bad
,
and
Phineas
try
to
quarrel
with
his
friend
;
but
he
find
that
it
be
difficult
to
quarrel
with
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
on
this
side
Phineas
be
very
miserable
,
on
another
side
he
have
obtain
great
comfort

<EOS>
Mr.
Monk

he
be
well
friend
than
ever

"

to
what

he

I
understand
each
other
perfectly

<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
you
on
your
leg
,
but
it
be
just
as
well
,
perhaps
,
that
you
have
defer
it
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
the
real
question
on
immediately
after
Easter
,
and
then
you
will
have
plenty
of
opportunity

<EOS>
"
Phineas
have
explain
how
he
have
attempt
,
how
he
have
fail
,
and
how
he
have
suffer
;

Mr.
Monk
have
be
generous
in
his
sympathy

I
know
all
about
it

he

have
go
through
it

the
more
respect
you
feel
for
the
House

more
satisfaction
you
will
have
in

it

the
first

to

him
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
would
not
.
<EOS>
You
be
too
big
to
be
put
down
,
and
no
man
can
really
dislike
to
hear
his
son
well
speak
of
by
those
who
be
well
spoken
of
themselves
.
<EOS>
will
not
you
try
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
say
that
he
would
think
of
it
,
 
that
he
would
try
if
any
fit
opportunity
could
be
find
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
know
how
intimate
I
have
be
with
the
Standishes
,
"
say
Violet
;
"
that
Laura
be
to
me
a
sister
,
and
that
Oswald
use
to
be
almost
a
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
speak
to
Lord
Brentford
;
 
you
who
be
his
favourite
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
reason
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
besides
,
how
can
any
girl
come
forward
and
say
that
she
know
the
disposition
of
any
man
?
<EOS>
You
can
live
with
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
see
what
he
be
make
of
,
and
know
his
thought
,
and
learn
what
be
good
in
him
,
and
also
what
be
bad
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
how
be
any
girl
really
to
know
anything
of
a
man
's
life
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
can
do
anything
,
Miss
Effingham
,
I
will
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
we
shall
all
of
us
be
so
grateful
to
you
,
"
say
Violet
,
with
her
sweetest
smile
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
retreat
from
this
conversation
,
stand
for
a
while
alone
,
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
have
she
speak
thus
of
Lord
Chiltern
because
she
do
love
him
or
because
she
do
not
?
<EOS>
and
the
sweet
commendation
which
have
fall
from
her
lip
upon
him
,
 
him
,
Phineas
Finn
,
 
be
they
compatible
with
anything
like
a
grow
partiality
for
himself
,
or
be
they
incompatible
with
any
such
feeling
?
<EOS>
have
he
most
reason
to
be
comfort
or
to
be
discomfit
by
what
have
take
place
?
<EOS>
It
seem
hardly
possible
to
his
imagination
that
Violet
Effingham
should
love
such
a
nobody
as
he
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
have
have
fair
evidence
that
one
stand
as
high
in
the
world
as
Violet
Effingham
would
fain
have
love
him
<EOS>
could
she
have
follow
the
dictate
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
He
have
tremble
when
he
have
first
resolve
to
declare
his
passion
to
Lady
Laura
,
 
fear
that
she
would
scorn
him
as
be
presumptuous
.
<EOS>
but
there
have
be
no
cause
for
such
fear
as
that
.
<EOS>
He
have
declare
his
love
,
and
she
have
not
think
him
to
be
presumptuous
.
<EOS>
that
now
be
age
ago
,
 
eight
month
since
;
and
Lady
Laura
have
become
a
married
woman
.
<EOS>
since
he
have
become
so
warmly
alive
to
the
charm
of
Violet
Effingham
he
have
determine
,
with
stern
propriety
,
that
a
passion
for
a
married
woman
be
disgraceful
.
<EOS>
such
love
be
in
itself
a
sin
,
even
though
it
be
accompany
by
the
severe
forbearance
and
the
most
rigid
propriety
of
conduct
.
<EOS>
no
;
 
Lady
Laura
have
do
wisely
to
check
the
grow
feeling
of
partiality
which
she
have
admit
;
and
now
that
she
be
married
,
he
would
be
as
wise
as
she
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
to
him
that
,
as
regard
his
own
heart
,
the
way
be
open
to
him
for
a
new
enterprise
.
<EOS>
but
what
if
he
be
to
fail
again
,
and
be
tell
by
Violet
,
when
he
declare
his
love
,
that
she
have
just
engage
herself
to
Lord
Chiltern
!
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
and
Violet
talk
about
so
eagerly
?
"
say
Lady
Laura
to
him
,
with
a
smile
that
,
in
its
approach
to
laughter
,
almost
betray
its
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
talk
about
your
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
to
him
,
be
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
leave
London
on
Sunday
night
;
 
but
only
for
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
he
any
chance
there
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
with
Miss
Effingham
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
 
with
Violet
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
she
love
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
say
?
<EOS>
in
such
a
matter
you
can
judge
better
than
I
can
do
.
<EOS>
one
woman
with
reference
to
another
can
draw
the
line
between
love
and
friendship
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
like
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
believe
she
love
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
but
she
fear
him
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
quite
understand
how
much
there
be
of
tenderness
with
that
assumed
ferocity
.
<EOS>
and
Oswald
be
so
strange
,
so
unwise
,
so
impolitic
,
that
though
he
love
her
better
than
all
the
world
beside
,
he
will
not
sacrifice
even
a
turn
of
a
word
to
win
her
.
<EOS>
when
he
ask
her
to
marry
him
,
he
almost
fly
at
her
throat
,
as
an
angry
debtor
who
apply
for
instant
payment
.
<EOS>
tell
him
,
Mr.
Finn
,
never
to
give
it
over
;
 
and
teach
him
that
he
should
be
soft
with
her
.
<EOS>
tell
him
,
also
,
that
in
her
heart
she
like
him
.
<EOS>
one
woman
,
as
you
say
,
know
another
woman
;
and
I
be
certain
he
would
win
her
if
he
would
only
be
gentle
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
again
,
before
they
part
,
Lady
Laura
tell
him
that
this
marriage
be
the
dear
wish
of
her
heart
,
and
that
there
would
be
no
end
to
her
gratitude
if
Phineas
could
do
anything
to
promote
it
.
<EOS>
all
which
again
make
our
hero
unhappy
.
   
<EOS>
Sunday
in
Grosvenor
Place
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
though
he
be
a
most
scrupulously
attentive
member
of
Parliament
,
be
a
man
very
punctual
to
hour
and
rule
in
his
own
house
,
 
and
like
that
his
wife
should
be
as
punctual
as
himself
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
,
who
in
marry
him
have
firmly
resolve
that
she
would
do
her
duty
to
him
in
all
way
,
even
though
the
way
may
sometimes
be
painful
,
 
and
have
be
perhaps
more
punctilious
in
this
respect
than
she
may
have
be
have
she
love
him
heartily
,
 
be
not
perhaps
quite
so
fond
of
accurate
regularity
as
her
husband
;
and
thus
,
by
this
time
,
certain
habit
of
his
have
become
rather
bond
than
habit
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
always
have
prayer
at
nine
,
and
breakfast
at
a
quarter
past
nine
,
let
the
hour
on
the
night
before
have
be
as
late
as
they
may
before
the
time
for
rest
have
come
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
he
would
open
his
letter
in
his
study
,
but
he
like
her
to
be
with
him
,
and
desire
to
discuss
with
her
every
application
he
get
from
a
constituent
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
private
secretary
in
a
room
apart
,
but
he
think
that
everything
should
be
filter
to
his
private
secretary
through
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
anxious
that
she
herself
should
superintend
the
account
of
their
own
private
expenditure
,
and
have
take
some
trouble
to
teach
her
an
excellent
mode
of
book
-
keeping
.
<EOS>
He
have
recommend
to
her
a
certain
course
of
reading
,
 
which
be
pleasant
enough
;
lady
like
to
receive
such
recommendation
;
but
Mr.
Kennedy
,
have
draw
out
the
course
,
seem
to
expect
that
his
wife
should
read
the
book
he
have
name
,
and
,
bad
still
,
that
she
should
read
them
in
the
time
he
have
allocate
for
the
work
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
think
,
be
tyranny
.
<EOS>
then
the
Sundays
become
very
wearisome
to
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
go
to
church
twice
,
she
have
learn
,
would
be
a
part
of
her
duty
;
and
though
in
her
father
's
household
attendance
at
church
have
never
be
very
strict
,
she
have
make
up
her
mind
to
this
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Kennedy
expect
also
that
he
and
she
should
always
dine
together
on
Sundays
,
that
there
should
be
no
guest
,
and
that
there
should
be
no
evening
company
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
the
demand
be
not
very
severe
,
but
yet
she
find
that
it
operate
injuriously
upon
her
comfort
.
<EOS>
the
Sundays
be
very
wearisome
to
her
,
and
make
her
feel
that
her
lord
and
master
be
 
her
lord
and
master
.
<EOS>
She
make
an
effort
or
two
to
escape
,
but
the
effort
be
all
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
never
speak
a
cross
word
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
never
give
a
stern
command
.
<EOS>
but
yet
he
have
his
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
that
read
a
novel
on
a
Sunday
be
a
sin
,
"
he
say
;
"
but
we
must
at
any
rate
admit
that
it
be
a
matter
on
which
man
disagree
,
that
many
of
the
good
of
man
be
against
such
occupation
on
Sunday
,
and
that
to
abstain
be
to
be
on
the
safe
side
.
"
<EOS>
so
the
novel
be
put
away
,
and
Sunday
afternoon
with
the
long
evening
become
rather
a
stumbling
-
block
to
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
those
two
hour
,
moreover
,
with
her
husband
in
the
morning
become
very
wearisome
to
her
.
<EOS>
at
first
she
have
declare
that
it
would
be
her
great
ambition
to
help
her
husband
in
his
work
,
and
she
have
read
all
the
letter
from
the
MacNabs
and
MacFies
,
ask
to
be
make
gauger
and
landing
-
waiter
,
with
an
assumed
interest
.
<EOS>
but
the
work
pal
upon
her
very
quickly
.
<EOS>
Her
quick
intellect
discover
soon
that
there
be
nothing
in
it
which
she
really
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
form
and
verbiage
,
and
pretence
at
business
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
go
through
it
all
with
the
utmost
patience
,
read
every
word
,
give
order
as
to
every
detail
,
and
conscientiously
do
that
which
he
conceive
he
have
undertake
to
do
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Laura
want
to
meddle
with
high
politic
,
to
discuss
reform
bill
,
to
assist
in
put
up
Mr.
This
and
put
down
my
Lord
that
.
<EOS>
why
should
she
waste
her
time
in
do
that
which
the
lad
in
the
next
room
,
who
be
call
a
private
secretary
,
could
do
as
well
?
  
<EOS>
still
she
would
obey
.
<EOS>
let
the
task
be
as
hard
as
it
may
,
she
would
obey
.
<EOS>
if
he
counsel
her
to
do
this
or
that
,
she
would
follow
his
counsel
,
 
because
she
owe
him
so
much
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
accept
the
half
of
all
his
wealth
without
love
him
,
she
owe
him
the
more
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
but
she
know
,
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
<EOS>
but
know
,
 
that
her
intellect
be
bright
than
his
;
and
may
it
not
be
possible
for
her
to
lead
him
?
<EOS>
then
she
make
effort
to
lead
her
husband
,
and
find
that
he
be
as
stiff
-
necked
as
an
ox
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
be
not
,
perhaps
,
a
clever
man
;
but
he
be
a
man
who
know
his
own
way
,
and
who
intend
to
keep
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
a
headache
,
Robert
,
"
she
say
to
him
one
Sunday
after
luncheon
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
will
not
go
to
church
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
serious
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
no
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
know
how
one
feel
sometimes
that
one
have
get
a
head
?
<EOS>
and
when
that
be
the
case
one
's
armchair
be
the
good
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
sure
of
that
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
go
to
church
<EOS>
I
should
not
attend
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
fresh
air
would
do
you
more
good
than
anything
else
,
and
we
could
walk
across
the
park
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
;
 
I
will
not
go
out
again
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
this
she
say
with
something
almost
of
crossness
in
her
manner
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
go
to
the
afternoon
service
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
when
she
be
leave
alone
begin
to
think
of
her
position
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
more
than
four
or
five
month
married
,
and
she
be
become
very
tired
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
also
true
that
she
be
become
tired
of
her
husband
?
<EOS>
She
have
twice
tell
Phineas
Finn
that
of
all
man
in
the
world
she
esteem
Mr.
Kennedy
the
most
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
esteem
him
less
now
.
<EOS>
She
know
no
point
or
particle
in
which
he
do
not
do
his
duty
with
accuracy
.
<EOS>
but
no
person
can
live
happily
with
another
,
 
not
even
with
a
brother
or
a
sister
or
a
friend
,
 
simply
upon
esteem
.
<EOS>
all
the
virtue
in
the
calendar
,
though
they
exist
on
each
side
,
will
not
make
a
man
and
woman
happy
together
,
unless
there
be
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
be
begin
to
find
out
that
there
be
a
lack
of
sympathy
between
herself
and
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
She
think
of
this
till
she
be
tired
of
think
of
it
,
and
then
,
wish
to
divert
her
mind
,
she
take
up
the
book
that
be
lie
near
to
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
volume
of
a
new
novel
which
she
have
be
read
on
the
previous
day
,
and
now
,
without
much
thought
about
it
,
she
go
on
with
her
reading
.
<EOS>
there
come
to
her
,
no
doubt
,
some
dim
,
half
-
form
idea
that
,
as
she
be
free
from
go
to
church
by
the
plea
of
a
headache
,
she
be
also
absolve
by
the
same
plea
from
other
Sunday
hindrance
.
<EOS>
a
child
,
when
it
be
ill
,
have
butter
toast
and
a
picture
-
book
instead
of
bread
-
and
-
milk
and
lesson
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
,
Lady
Laura
conceive
herself
to
be
entitle
to
her
novel
.
  
<EOS>
while
she
be
read
it
,
there
come
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
Barrington
Erle
be
show
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
have
give
no
order
against
Sunday
visitor
,
but
have
simply
say
that
Sunday
visit
be
not
to
his
taste
.
<EOS>
Barrington
,
however
,
be
Lady
Laura
's
cousin
,
and
people

him

no

I
never
will

I
will
tell
you
what
.
<EOS>
I
shall
get
into
some
desperate
scrape
about
her
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
will
marry
,
and
that
soon
.
<EOS>
then
I
shall
make
a
fool
of
myself

<EOS>
when
I
hear
that
she
be
engage
I
shall
go
and
quarrel
with
the
man
,
and
kick
him
,

get
kick
.
<EOS>
all
the
world
will
turn
against
me

I
shall
be
call
a
wild
beast

exactly
;
 
but
how
be
a
man
to
help
it
?
<EOS>
if
you
love
a
girl
,
could
you
see
another
man
take
her
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
remember
of
course
that
he
have
lately
come
through
this
ordeal
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
though
he
be
to
come
and
put
his
hand
upon
me
,
and
want
my
own
heart
out
of
me
.
<EOS>
though
I
have
no
property
in
her
at
all
,
no
right
to
her
,
 
though
she
never
give
me
a
word
of
encouragement
,
it
be
as
though
she
be
the
most
private
thing
in
the
world
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
half
mad
,
and
in
my
madness
I
could
not
master
the
idea
that
I
be
be
rob
.
<EOS>
I
should
resent
it
as
a
personal
interference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
will
come
to
that
if
you
give
her
up
yourself
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
question
of
give
up

<EOS>
of
course
I
can
not
make
her

<EOS>
light
another
cigar
,
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
light
the
other
cigar
,
remember
that
he
owe
a
certain
duty
in
this
matter
to
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
She
have
commission
him
to
persuade
her
brother
that
his
suit
with
Violet
Effingham
would
not
be
hopeless
,
if
he
could
only
restrain
himself
in
his
mode
of
conduct
it
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
dispose
to
do
his
duty
,
although
he
feel
it
to
be
very
hard
that
he
should
be
call
upon
to
be
eloquent
against
his
own
interest
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
think
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
how
he
must
bear
himself
if
it
may
turn
out
that
he
should
be
the
man
whom
Lord
Chiltern
be
resolve
to
kick
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
his
friend
and
host
,
and
become
aware
that
a
kicking
-
match
with
such
a
one
would
not
be
pleasant
pastime
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
would
be
happy
enough
to
be
subject
to
Lord
Chiltern
's
wrath
for
such
a
reason
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
his
duty
by
Lord
Chiltern
;
and
then
,
when
that
have
be
adequately
do
,
he
would
,
if
occasion
serve
,
fight
a
battle
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
too
sudden
with
her
,
Chiltern
,
"
he
say
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
by
too
sudden
?
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
,
almost
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
frighten
her
by
be
so
impetuous
.
<EOS>
You
rush
at
her
as
though
you
want
to
conquer
her
by
a
single
blow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
be
more
gentle
with
her
.
<EOS>
You
should
give
her
time
to
find
out
whether
she
like
you
or
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
know
me
all
her
life
,
and
have
find
that
out
long
ago
.
<EOS>
not
but
what
you
be
right
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
be
right
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
you
,
and
have
your
skill
in
pleasing
,
I
should
drop
soft
word
into
her
ear
till
I
have
catch
her
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
gift
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
be
as
awkward
as
a
pig
at
what
be
call
flirt
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
an
accurse
pride
which
stand
in
my
own
light

<EOS>
if
she
be
in
this
house
this
moment

if
I
know
she
be
to
be
have
for
ask
,
I
do
not
think
I
could
bring
myself
to
ask
again
.
<EOS>
but
we
will
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
It
be
half
-
past
two
,
and
we
must
be
off
at
half
-
past
nine
,
if
we
be
to
be
at
Exton
Park
gate
at
eleven

"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
go
up
-
stair
,
assure
himself
that
he
have
do
his
duty
.
<EOS>
if
there
ever
should
come
to
be
anything
between
him
and
Violet
Effingham
,
Lord
Chiltern
may
quarrel
with
him
,
 
may
probably
attempt
that
kick
encounter
to
which
allusion
have
be
make
,
 
but
nobody
could
justly
say
that
he
have
not
behave
honourably
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
there
be
a
bustle
and
a
scurry
,
as
there
always
be
on
such
occasion
,
and
the
two
man
get
off
about
ten
minute
after
time
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
Chiltern
drive
hard
,
and
they
reach
the
meet
before
the
master
have
move
off
.
<EOS>
They
have
a
fair
day
's
sport
with
the
Cottesmore
;
and
Phineas
,
though
he
find
that
Meg
Merrilies
do
require
a
good
deal
of
riding
,
go
through
his
day
's
work
with
credit
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
ride
since
he
be
a
child
,
as
be
the
custom
with
all
boy
in
Munster
,
and
have
an
Irishman
's
natural
aptitude
for
jump
.
<EOS>
when
they
get
back
to
the
Willingford
Bull
he
feel
pleased
with
the
day
and
rather
proud
of
himself
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
fast
,
you
know
,
"
say
Chiltern
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
do
not
call
that
a
stiff
country
.
<EOS>
besides
,
Meg
be
very
handy
when
you
have
get
her
out
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
You
shall
ride
Bonebreaker
to
-
morrow
at
Somerby
,
and
you
will
find
that
well
fun
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bonebreaker
?
<EOS>
have
not
I
hear
you
say
he
rush
like
mischief
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
he
do
rush
.
<EOS>
but
,
by
George
!
<EOS>
you
want
a
horse
to
rush
in
that
country
.
<EOS>
when
you
have
to
go
right
through
four
or
five
foot
of
stiff
green
wood
,
like
a
bullet
through
a
target
,
you
want
a
little
force
,
or
you
be
apt
to
be
leave
up
a
tree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
you
ride
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
brute
I
never
put
my
leg
on
yet
.
<EOS>
He
be
send
down
to
Wilcox
here
,
out
of
Lincolnshire
,
because
they
could
not
get
anybody
to
ride
him
there
.
<EOS>
They
say
he
go
with
his
head
up
in
the
air
,
and
will
not
look
at
a
fence
that
be
not
as
high
as
his
breast
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
he
will
do
here
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
better
make
beast
,
or
one
with
more
power
.
<EOS>
do
you
look
at
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
be
have
for
seventy
pound
,
and
these
be
the
sort
of
horse
I
like
to
buy
.
"
  
<EOS>
again
they
dine
alone
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
explain
to
Phineas
that
he
rarely
associate
with
the
man
of
either
of
the
hunt
in
which
he
ride
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
set
of
fellow
down
here
who
be
poison
to
me
,
and
there
be
another
set
,
and
I
be
poison
to
them
.
<EOS>
everybody
be
very
civil
,
as
you
see
,
but
I
have
no
associate
.
<EOS>
and
gradually
I
be
get
to
have
a
reputation
as
though
I
be
the
devil
himself
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
come
out
next
year
dress
entirely
in
black
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
not
wrong
to
give
way
to
that
kind
of
thing
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
the
deuce
be
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
make
civil
little
speech
.
<EOS>
when
once
a
man
get
a
reputation
as
an
ogre
,
it
be
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
drop
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
a
score
of
man
here
every
day
if
I
like
it
,
 
my
title
would
do
that
for
me
;
 
but
they
would
be
man
I
should
loathe
,
and
I
should
be
sure
to
tell
them
so
,
even
though
I
do
not
mean
it
.
<EOS>
Bonebreaker
,
and
the
new
horse
,
and
another
,
go
on
at
twelve
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
You
must
expect
hard
work
to
-
morrow
,
as
I
daresay
we
shall
not
be
home
before
eight
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
's
meet
be
in
Leicestershire
,
not
far
from
Melton
,
and
they
start
early
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
to
tell
the
truth
of
him
,
be
rather
afraid
of
Bonebreaker
,
and
look
forward
to
the
probability
of
an
accident
.
<EOS>
He
have
neither
wife
nor
child
,
and
nobody
have
a
well
right
to
risk
his
neck
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
put
a
gag
on
"
i
be
,
"
say
the
groom
,
"
and
you
will
ride
"
i
be
in
a
ring
,
 
so
that
you
may
well
-
nigh
break
his
jaw
;
but
he
be
a
rum
un
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
my
good
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
will
take
all
that
,
"
say
the
groom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
just
let
him
have
his
own
way
at
everything
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
,
as
they
move
away
from
the
meet
to
Pickwell
Gorse
;
"
and
if
you
will
only
sit
on
his
back
,
he
will
carry
you
through
as
safe
as
a
church
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
could
not
help
think
that
the
counsel
of
the
master
and
of
the
groom
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
"
My
idea
be
,
"
continue
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
that
in
hunt
you
should
always
avoid
a
crowd
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
a
horse
be
worth
ride
that
will
go
in
a
crowd
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
like
yacht
,
 
you
should
have
plenty
of
sea
-
room
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
pull
your
horse
up
at
every
fence
till
somebody
else
be
over
,
I
think
you
would
better
come
out
on
a
donkey
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
they
go
away
to
Pickwell
Gorse
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
over
two
hundred
man
out
,
and
Phineas
begin
to
think
that
it
may
not
be
so
easy
to
get
out
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
a
crowd
in
a
fast
run
no
doubt
quickly
become
small
by
degree
and
beautifully
less
;
but
it
be
very
difficult
,
especially
for
a
stranger
,
to
free
himself
from
the
rush
at
the
first
start
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
's
horse
plunge
about
so
violently
,
as
they
stand
on
a
little
hill
-
side
look
down
upon
the
cover
,
that
he
be
oblige
to
take
him
to
a
distance
,
and
Phineas
follow
him
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
break
down
wind
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
we
can
not
be
well
than
we
be
here
.
<EOS>
if
he
go
up
wind
,
he
must
turn
before
long
,
and
we
shall
be
all
right
.
"
<EOS>
as
he
speak
an
old
hound
open
true
and
sharp
,
 
an
old
hound
whom
all
the
pack
believe
,
 
and
in
a
moment
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
fox
have
be
find
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
above
eight
or
nine
acre
in
it
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
and
he
can
not
hang
long
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
see
such
an
uneasy
brute
as
this
in
your
life
?
<EOS>
but
I
feel
certain
he
will
go
well
when
he
get
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
be
too
much
occupy
with
his
own
horse
to
think
much
of
that
on
which
Lord
Chiltern
be
mount
.
<EOS>
Bonebreaker
,
the
very
moment
that
he
hear
the
old
hound
's
note
,
stretch
out
his
head
,
and
put
his
mouth
upon
the
bit
,
and
begin
to
tremble
in
every
muscle
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
great
deal
more
anxious
for
it
than
you
<EOS>
and
I
be
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
they
have
give
you
that
gag
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
you
ride
him
on
it
till
he
want
it
.
<EOS>
give
him
lot
of
room
,
and
he
will
go
in
the
snaffle
.
<EOS>
"
all
which
caution
make
Phineas
think
that
any
insurance
office
would
charge
very
dear
on
his
life
at
the
present
moment
.
  
<EOS>
the
fox
take
two
ring
of
the
gorse
,
and
then
he
go
,
 
up
wind
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
a
vixen
,
I
will
swear
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
vixen
in
cub
never
go
away
like
that
yet
.
<EOS>
now
then
,
Finn
,
my
boy
,
keep
to
the
right
.
"
<EOS>
and
Lord
Chiltern
,
with
the
horse
out
of
Lincolnshire
,
go
away
across
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
leave
the
hound
to
the
left
,
and
select
,
as
his
point
of
exit
into
the
next
field
,
a
stiff
rail
,
which
,
have
there
be
an
accident
,
must
have
put
a
very
wide
margin
of
ground
between
the
rider
and
his
horse
.
<EOS>
"
go
hard
at
your
fence
,
and
then
you
will
fall
clear
,
"
he
have
say
to
Phineas
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
,
however
,
that
he
would
have
ride
at
the
rail
as
he
do
,
but
that
there
be
no
help
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
brute
begin
in
his
own
way
,
and
carry
on
after
in
the
same
fashion
all
through
,
"
he
say
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Phineas
take
the
fence
a
little
low
down
,
and
what
it
be
at
which
he
ride
he
never
know
.
<EOS>
Bonebreaker
sail
over
it
,
whatever
it
be
,
and
he
soon
find
himself
by
his
friend
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
the
ruck
of
the
man
be
low
down
than
our
two
hero
,
and
there
be
other
far
away
to
the
left
,
and
other
,
again
,
who
have
be
at
the
end
of
the
gorse
,

be
now
behind

<EOS>
Our
friend
be
not
near
the
hound
,
not
within
two
field
of
them
,
but
the
hound
be
below
them

therefore
could
be
see
.

<EOS>
"
how
the
deuce
be
one
to
help
be
in
a
hurry
?
"
say
Phineas
,
who
be
do
his
very
good
to
ride
Bonebreaker
with
the
snaffle

but
have
already
begin
to
feel
that
Bonebreaker
care
nothing
for
that
weak
instrument

"
<EOS>
by
George
,
I
should
like
to
change
with
you
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
the
Lincolnshire
horse
be
go
along
with
his
head
very
low
,
boring
as
he
gallop
,
but
throw
his
neck
up
at
his
fence
,
just
when
he
ought
to
have
keep
himself
steady
.
<EOS>
after
this
,
though
Phineas
keep
near
Lord
Chiltern
throughout
the
run
,
they
be
not
again
near
enough
to
exchange
word
;
and
,
indeed
,
they
have
but
<EOS>
little
breath
for
such
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
ride
still
a
little
in
advance
,
and
Phineas
,
know
his
friend
's
partiality
for
solitude
when
take
his
fence
,
keep
a
little
to
his
left
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
find
that
Bonebreaker
know
pretty
well
what
he
be
about
.
<EOS>
as
for
not
use
the
gag
rein
,
that
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
when
a
horse
put
out
what
strength
he
have
against
a
man
's
arm
,
a
man
must
put
out
what
strength
he
have
against
the
horse
's
mouth
.
<EOS>
but
Bonebreaker
be
cunne
,
and
have
have
a
gag
rein
on
before
.
<EOS>
He
contract
his
lip
here
,
and
bend
out
his
jaw
there
,
till
he
have
settle
it
to
his
mind
,
and
then
go
away
after
his
own
fashion
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
a
passion
for
smash
through
big
,
high
-
grow
ox
-
fence
,
and
by
degree
his
rider
come
to
feel
that
if
there
be
nothing
bad
come
,
the
fun
be
not
bad
.
  
<EOS>
the
fox
run
up
wind
for
a
couple
of
mile
or
so
,
as
Lord
Chiltern
have
prophesy
,
and
then
turn
,
 
not
to
the
right
,
as
would
best
have
serve
him
and
Phineas
,
but
to
the
left
,
 
so
that
they
be
force
to
make
their
way
through
the
ruck
of
horse
before
they
could
place
themselves
again
.
<EOS>
Phineas
find
himself
cross
a
road
,
in
and
out
of
it
,
before
he
know
where
he
be
,
and
for
a
while
he
lose
sight
of
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
but
in
truth
he
be
lead
now
,
whereas
Lord
Chiltern
have
lead
before
.
<EOS>
the
two
horse
have
be
together
all
the
morning
,
and
on
the
previous
day
,
be
willing
enough
to
remain
in
company
,
if
they
be
allow
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
They
both
cross
the
road
,
not
very
far
from
each
other
,
go
in
and
out
amidst
a
crowd
of
horse
,
and
before
long
be
again
place
well
,
now
have
the
hunt
on
their
right
,
whereas
hitherto
it
have
be
on
their
left
.
<EOS>
They
go
over
large
pasture
field
,
and
Phineas
begin
to
think
that
as
long
as
Bonebreaker
would
be
able
to
go
through
the
thick
grow
-
up
hedge
,
all
would
be
right
.
<EOS>
now
and
again
he
come
to
a
cut
fence
,
a
fence
that
have
be
cut
and
lay
,
and
these
be
not
so
pleasant
.
<EOS>
force
be
not
sufficient
for
them
,
and
they
admit
of
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
but
the
horse
,
though
he
would
rush
at
them
unpleasantly
,
take
them
when
they
come
without
touch
them
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
all
right
yet
,
 
unless
the
beast
should
tire
with
him
;
and
then
,
Phineas
think
,
a
misfortune
may
probably
occur
.
<EOS>
He
remember
,
as
he
fly
over
one
such
impediment
,
that
he
ride
a
stone
heavier
than
his
friend
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
forty
-
five
minute
Bonebreaker
also
may
become
aware
of
the
fact
.
  
<EOS>
the
hound
be
run
well
in
sight
to
their
right
,
and
Phineas
begin
to
feel
some
of
that
pride
which
a
man
indulge
when
he
become
aware
that
he
have
take
his
place
comfortably
,
have
leave
the
squad
behind
,
and
be
go
well
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
nearer
the
hound
than
he
be
,
but
he
be
near
enough
even
for
ambition
.
<EOS>
there
have
already
be
enough
of
the
run
to
make
him
sure
that
it
would
be
a
"
good
thing
"
,
and
enough
to
make
him
aware
also
that
probably
it
may
be
too
good
.
<EOS>
when
a
run
be
over
,
man
be
very
apt
to
regret
the
termination
,
who
a
minute
or
two
before
be
anxiously
long
that
the
hound
may
pull
down
their
game
.
<EOS>
to
finish
well
be
everything
in
hunting
.
<EOS>
to
have
lead
for
over
an
hour
be
nothing
,
let
the
pace
and
country
have
be
what
they
may
,
if
you
fall
away
during
the
last
half
mile
.
<EOS>
therefore
it
be
that
those
behind
hope
that
the
fox
may
make
this
or
that
cover
,
while
the
forward
man
long
to
see
him
turn
over
in
every
field
.
<EOS>
to
ride
to
hound
be
very
glorious
;
but
to
have
ride
to
hound
be
more
glorious
still
.
<EOS>
They
have
now
cross
another
road
,
and
a
large
one
,
and
have
get
into
a
somewhat
close
country
.
<EOS>
the
field
be
not
so
big
,
and
the
fence
be
not
so
high
.
<EOS>
Phineas
get
a
moment
to
look
about
him
,
and
see
Lord
Chiltern
ride
without
his
cap
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
red
in
the
face
,
and
his
eye
seem
to
glare
,
and
he
be
tug
at
his
horse
with
all
his
might
.
<EOS>
but
the
animal
seem
still
to
go
with
perfect
command
of
strength
,
and
Phineas
have
too
much
work
on
his
own
hand
to
think
of
offer
quixotic
assistance
to
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
He
see
some
one
,
a
farmer
,
as
he
think
,
speak
to
Lord
Chiltern
as
they
ride
close
together
;
but
Chiltern
only
shake
his
head
and
pull
at
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
brook
in
those
part
.
<EOS>
the
river
Eye
form
itself
thereabout
,
or
some
of
its
tributary
do
so
;
and
these
tributary
,
though
small
as
river
,
be
considerable
to
man
on
one
side
who
be
call
by
the
exigency
of
the
occasion
to
place
themselves
quickly
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Phineas
know
nothing
of
these
brook
;
but
Bonebreaker
have
go
gallantly
over
two
,
and
now
that
there
come
a
third
in
the
way
<EOS>
,
it
be
to
be
hope
that
he
may
go
gallantly
over
that
also
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
at
any
rate
,
have
no
power
to
decide
otherwise
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
the
brute
would
go
straight
with
him
he
could
sit
him
;
but
he
have
long
give
up
the
idea
of
have
a
will
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
till
he
be
within
twenty
yard
of
the
brook
,
he
do
not
see
that
it
be
large
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
He
look
around
,
and
there
be
chiltern
close
to
him
,
still
fight
with
his
horse
;
 
but
the
farmer
have
turn
away
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
Chiltern
nod
to
him
,
as
much
as
to
tell
him
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
on
he
go
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
the
brook
,
when
he
come
to
it
,
seem
to
be
a
huge
black
hole
,
yawn
beneath
him
.
<EOS>
the
bank
be
quite
steep
,
and
just
where
he
be
to
take
off
there
be
an
ugly
stump
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
to
think
of
anything
.
<EOS>
He
stick
his
knee
against
his
saddle
,
 
and
in
a
moment
be
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
the
brute
,
who
have
take
off
a
yard
before
the
stump
,
know
well
the
danger
of
strike
it
with
his
foot
,
come
down
with
a
grunt
,
and
do
,
I
think
,
begin
to
feel
the
weight
of
that
extra
stone
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
soon
as
he
be
safe
,
look
back
,
and
there
be
Lord
Chiltern
's
horse
in
the
very
act
of
his
spring
,
 
higher
up
the
rivulet
,
where
it
be
even
broad
.
<EOS>
at
that
distance
Phineas
could
see
that
Lord
Chiltern
be
wild
with
rage
against
the
beast
.
<EOS>
but
whether
he
wish
to
take
the
leap
or
wish
to
avoid
it
,
there
be
no
choice
leave
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
animal
rush
at
the
brook
,
and
in
a
moment
the
horse
and
horseman
be
lose
to
sight
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
then
that
that
extra
stone
should
tell
,
as
it
enable
Phineas
to
arrest
his
horse
and
to
come
back
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
the
Lincolnshire
horse
have
cheste
the
further
bank
,
and
of
course
have
fall
back
into
the
stream
.
<EOS>
when
Phineas
get
down
he
find
that
Lord
Chiltern
be
wedge
in
between
the
horse
and
the
bank
,
which
be
well
,
at
any
rate
,
than
be
under
the
horse
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
old
fellow
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
,
with
a
smile
,
when
he
see
Phineas
.
"
You
go
on
;
it
be
too
good
to
lose
.
"
<EOS>
but
he
be
very
pale
,
and
seem
to
be
quite
helpless
where
he
lie
.
<EOS>
the
horse
do
not
move
,
 
and
never
do
move
again
.
<EOS>
He
have
smash
his
shoulder
to
piece
against
a
stump
on
the
bank
,
and
be
afterwards
shoot
on
that
very
spot
.
  
<EOS>
when
Phineas
get
down
he
find
that
there
be
but
little
water
where
the
horse
lie
.
<EOS>
the
depth
of
the
stream
have
be
on
the
side
from
which
they
have
take
off
,
and
the
thick
black
mud
lie
within
a
foot
of
the
surface
,
close
to
the
bank
against
which
Lord
Chiltern
be
prop
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
bad
one
I
ever
be
on
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
gruelle
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
hurt
?
"
  
"
well
;
 
I
fancy
there
be
something
amiss
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
move
my
arm
;
and
I
catch
my
breath
.
<EOS>
My
leg
be
all
right
if
I
could
get
away
from
this
accurse
brute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
so
,
"
say
the
farmer
,
come
and
look
down
upon
them
from
the
bank
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
so
,
but
you
would
not
be
say
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
too
get
down
,
and
between
them
both
they
extricate
Lord
Chiltern
from
his
position
,
and
get
him
on
to
the
bank
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
un
's
a
dead
un
,
"
say
the
farmer
,
point
to
the
horse
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
much
the
well
,
"
say
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
give
us
a
drop
of
sherry
,
Finn
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
break
his
collar
-
bone
and
three
of
his
rib
.
<EOS>
They
get
a
farmer
's
trap
from
Wissindine
and
take
him
into
Oakham
.
<EOS>
when
there
,
he
insist
on
be
take
on
through
Stamford
to
the
Willingford
Bull
before
he
would
have
his
bone
set
,
 
pick
up
,
however
,
a
surgeon
at
Stamford
.
<EOS>
Phineas
remain
with
him
for
a
couple
of
day
,
lose
his
run
with
the
Fitzwilliams
and
a
day
at
the
pot
pea
,
and
become
very
fond
of
his
patient
as
he
sit
by
his
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
good
run
,
though
,
be
not
it
?
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
as
Phineas
take
his
leave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
,
by
George
,
Phineas
,
you
ride
Bonebreaker
<EOS>
so
well
,
that
you
shall
have
him
as
often
as
you
will
come
down
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
but
you
irish
fellow
always
ride
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
's
carriage
stop
the
way
 
when
Phineas
get
back
to
London
,
a
day
after
his
time
,
he
find
that
there
be
already
a
great
political
commotion
in
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
He
have
know
that
on
Easter
Monday
and
Tuesday
there
be
to
be
a
gathering
of
the
people
in
favour
of
the
ballot
,
and
that
on
Wednesday
there
be
to
be
a
procession
with
a
petition
which
Mr.
Turnbull
be
to
receive
from
the
hand
of
the
people
on
Primrose
Hill
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
at
first
intend
that
Mr.
Turnbull
should
receive
the
petition
at
the
door
of
Westminster
Hall
on
the
Thursday
;
but
he
have
be
request
by
the
Home
Secretary
to
put
aside
this
intention
,
and
he
have
comply
with
the
request
make
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
be
to
move
the
second
reading
of
his
Reform
Bill
on
that
day
,
the
preliminary
step
have
be
take
without
any
special
notice
;
but
the
bill
of
course
include
no
clause
in
favour
of
the
ballot
;
and
this
petition
be
the
consequence
of
that
omission
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
have
predict
evil
consequence
,
both
in
the
House
and
out
of
it
,
and
be
now
do
the
good
in
his
power
to
bring
about
the
verification
of
his
own
prophecy
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
reach
his
lodging
late
on
the
Thursday
,
find
that
the
town
have
be
in
a
state
of
ferment
for
three
day
,
that
on
the
Wednesday
forty
or
fifty
thousand
person
have
be
collect
at
Primrose
Hill
,
and
that
the
police
have
be
force
to
interfere
,
 
and
that
bad
be
expect
on
the
Friday
.
<EOS>
though
Mr.
Turnbull
have
yield
to
the
Government
as
to
receive
the
petition
,
the
crowd
be
resolve
that
they
would
see
the
petition
carry
into
the
House
.
<EOS>
It
be
argue
that
the
Government
would
have
do
better
to
have
refrain
from
interfere
as
to
the
previously
intend
arrangement
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
easy
to
deal
with
a
procession
than
with
a
mob
of
man
gather
together
without
any
semblance
of
form
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
have
be
ask
to
postpone
the
second
reading
of
his
bill
;
but
the
request
have
come
from
his
opponent
,
and
he
would
not
yield
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
say
that
it
would
be
a
bad
expedient
to
close
Parliament
from
fear
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
Phineas
find
at
the
Reform
Club
on
the
Thursday
evening
that
member
of
the
House
of
Commons
be
request
to
enter
on
the
Friday
by
the
door
usually
use
by
the
peer
,
and
to
make
their
way
thence
to
their
own
House
.
<EOS>
He
find
that
his
landlord
,
Mr.
Bunce
,
have
be
out
with
the
people

to
the
Friday

<EOS>
He

headstrong

Westminster

with
soldier

"
phineas
on
the
Friday
morning
do
have
some
conversation
with
his
landlord
;
but
his
first
work
on
reach
London
be
to
see
Lord
Chiltern
's
friend

and
tell
them
of
the
accident

<EOS>
the
potted
pea
Committee
sit
on
the
Thursday
,

he
ought
to
have
be
there
.
<EOS>
His
absence
,
however
,
be
unavoidable
,
as
he
could
not
have
leave
his
friend
's
bed
-
side
so
soon
after
the
accident
.
<EOS>
on
the
Wednesday
he

on
the
Thursday
evening

first
to
Portman
Square

to
Grosvenor
Place

"
of
course
he
will
kill
himself
some
day

the
Earl

in
each
eye

"
I
hope
not
,
my
lord

He
be
a
magnificent
horseman

accident
of
course
will
happen
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
how
many
of
his
bone
be
there
not
break
,
I
wonder
?

say
the
father
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
useless
to
talk
,

You
think
he
be
not
in
danger
?

"
certainly
not
.

I
should
fear
that

would
be
so
liable

the
doctor

an
enormous
deal

Phineas

no

that

what
do

then
?

ask
the
Earl

nothing

I
rather
think

my
lord

you
be

a
little
about
his

I
do
not
fancy

to
do
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
provoke
!
<EOS>
Could
anything
provoke
you
to
make
a
brute
of
yourself

I
be
glad
that
he
be
in
no
danger

you
hear
of
him

let
me
know

<EOS>
Lady
Laura

full
of
concern

"
I
want
to

down

Mr.

again

Mr.
Kennedy
will
not

can

He
seem
to
think
that

Oswald
have
have
accident
before
,
it
be
nothing

of
course
I
can
not
leave
London
without
his
leave

Your
brother

very
little
of

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
 
he
would
make
little
of
anything

Phineas
have
not

at
the
matter
in

he

that
Miss
Effingham
may
probably
be
right

early
on
the
next
morning

Mr.
Bunce

all
his
eloquence

good
do
you
expect

Mr.

it

he
go

<EOS>
the
petition
be
to
be
present
at
six
o'clock
,
but
the
crowd
,
who
collect
to
see
it
carry
into
Westminster
Hall
,
begin
to
form
itself
by
noon
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
afterwards
that
many
of
the
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Palace
Yard
and
the
Bridge
be
fill
with
soldier
;
but
if
so
,
the
man
do
not
show
themselves
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
evening
three
or
four
company
of
the
Guards
in
St.
James
's
Park
do
show
themselves
,
and
have
some
rough
work
to
do
,
for
many
of
the
people
take
themselves
away
from
Westminster
by
that
route
.
<EOS>
the
police
,
who
be
very
numerous
in
Palace
Yard
,
have
a
hard
time
of
it
all
the
afternoon
,
and
it
be
say
afterwards
that
it
would
have
be
much
well
to
have
allow
the
petition
to
have
be
bring
up
by
the
procession
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
a
procession
,
let
it
be
who
it
will
that
proceed
,
have
in
it
,
of
its
own
nature
something
of
order
.
<EOS>
but
now
there
be
no
order
.
<EOS>
the
petition
,
which
be
say
to
fill
fifteen
cab
,
 
though
the
absolute
sheet
of
signature
be
carry
into
the
House
by
four
man
,
 
be
be
drag
about
half
the
day
and
it
certainly
would
have
be
impossible
for
a
member
to
have
make
his
way
into
the
House
through
Westminster
Hall
between
the
hour
of
four
and
six
.
<EOS>
to
effect
an
entrance
at
all
they
be
oblige
to
go
round
at
the
back
of
the
Abbey
,
as
all
the
space
round
St.
Margaret
's
Church
and
Canning
's
monument
be
fill
with
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Parliament
Street
be
quite
impassable
at
five
o
clock
,
and
there
be
no
traffic
across
the
bridge
from
that
hour
till
after
eight
.
<EOS>
as
the
evening
go
on
,
the
mob
extend
itself
to
Downing
Street
and
the
front
of
the
Treasury
Chambers
,
and
before
the
night
be
over
<EOS>
all
the
hoarding
round
the
new
Government
office
have
be
pull
down
.
<EOS>
the
window
also
of
certain
obnoxious
member
of
Parliament
be
break
,
when
those
obnoxious
member
live
within
reach
.
<EOS>
one
gentleman
who
unfortunately
hold
a
house
in
Richmond
Terrace
,
and
who
be
say
to
have
say
that
the
ballot
be
the
resort
of
coward
,
fare
very
badly
;
 
for
his
window
be
not
only
break
,
but
his
furniture
and
mirror
be
destroy
by
the
stone
that
be
throw
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
I
say
,
be
much
blame
.
<EOS>
but
after
all
,
it
may
be
a
doubt
whether
the
procession
on
Wednesday
may
not
have
end
bad
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
be
hear
to
say
afterwards
that
the
number
of
people
collect
would
have
be
much
great
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
move
the
second
reading
of
his
bill
,
and
make
his
speech
.
<EOS>
He
make
his
speech
with
the
knowledge
that
the
Houses
of
Parliament
be
surround
by
a
mob
,
and
I
think
that
the
fact
add
to
its
efficacy
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
give
him
an
appropriate
opportunity
for
a
display
which
be
not
difficult
.
<EOS>
His
voice
falter
on
two
or
three
occasion
,
and
falter
through
real
feeling
;
but
this
sort
of
feeling
,
though
it
be
real
,
be
at
the
command
of
orator
on
certain
occasion
,
and
do
them
yeoman
's
service
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
be
an
old
man
,
nearly
wear
out
in
the
service
of
his
country
,
who
be
know
to
have
be
true
and
honest
,
and
to
have
love
his
country
well
,
 
though
there
be
of
course
they
who
declare
that
his
hand
have
be
too
weak
for
power
,
and
that
his
service
have
be
naught
;
 
and
on
this
evening
his
virtue
be
remember
.
<EOS>
once
when
his
voice
fail
him
the
whole
House
get
up
and
cheer
.
<EOS>
the
nature
of
a
Whig
Prime
Minister
's
speech
on
such
an
occasion
will
be
understand
by
most
of
my
reader
without
further
indication
.
<EOS>
the
bill
itself
have
be
read
before
,
and
it
be
understand
that
no
objection
would
be
make
to
the
extent
of
the
change
provide
in
it
by
the
liberal
side
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
the
opposition
come
from
liberal
member
be
to
be
confine
to
the
subject
of
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
and
even
as
yet
it
be
not
know
whether
Mr.
Turnbull
and
his
follower
would
vote
against
the
second
reading
,
or
whether
they
would
take
what
be
give
,
and
declare
their
intention
of
obtain
the
remainder
on
a
separate
motion
.
<EOS>
the
opposition
of
a
large
party
of
Conservatives
be
a
matter
of
certainty
;
but
to
this
party
Mr.
Mildmay
do
not
conceive
himself
bind
to
offer
so
large
an
amount
of
argument
as
he
would
have
give
<EOS>
have
there
be
at
the
moment
<EOS>
no
crowd
in
Palace
Yard
.
<EOS>
and
he
probably
feel
that
that
crowd
would
assist
him
with
his
old
Tory
enemy
.
<EOS>
when
,
in
the
last
word
of
his
speech
,
he
declare
that
under
no
circumstance
would
he
disfigure
the
close
of
his
political
career
by
vote
for
the
ballot
,
 
not
though
the
people
,
on
whose
behalf
he
have
be
fight
battle
all
his
life
,
should
be
there
in
any
number
to
coerce
him
,
 
there
come
another
round
of
applause
from
the
opposition
bench
,
and
Mr.
Daubeny
begin
to
fear
that
some
young
horse
in
his
team
may
get
loose
from
their
trace
.
<EOS>
with
great
dignity
Mr.
Daubeny
have
keep
aloof
from
Mr.
Turnbull
and
from
Mr.
Turnbull
's
tactic
;
but
he
be
not
the
less
alive
to
the
fact
that
Mr.
Turnbull
,
with
his
mob
and
his
big
petition
,
may
be
of
considerable
assistance
to
him
in
this
present
duel
between
himself
and
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
I
think
Mr.
Daubeny
be
in
the
habit
of
look
at
these
contest
as
duel
between
himself
and
the
leader
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
,
 
in
which
assistance
from
any
quarter
may
be
accept
if
offer
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
's
speech
do
not
occupy
much
over
an
hour
,
and
at
half
-
past
seven
Mr.
Turnbull
get
up
to
reply
.
<EOS>
It
be
presume
that
he
would
do
so
,
and
not
a
member
leave
his
place
,
though
that
time
of
the
day
be
an
interesting
time
,
and
though
Mr.
Turnbull
be
accustomed
to
be
long
.
<EOS>
there
soon
come
to
be
but
little
ground
for
doubt
what
would
be
the
nature
of
Mr.
Turnbull
's
vote
on
the
second
reading
.
<EOS>
"
how
may
I
dare
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
accept
so
small
a
measure
of
reform
as
this
with
such
a
message
from
the
country
as
be
now
convey
to
me
through
the
presence
of
fifty
thousand
of
my
countryman
,
who
be
at
this
moment
demand
their
measure
of
reform
just
beyond
the
frail
wall
of
this
chamber
?
<EOS>
the
right
honourable
gentleman
have
tell
us
that
he
will
never
be
intimidate
by
a
concourse
of
people
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
there
be
any
need
that
he
should
speak
of
intimidation
.
<EOS>
no
one
have
accuse
the
right
honourable
gentleman
of
political
cowardice
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
have
so
say
,
I
will
follow
in
his
footstep
.
<EOS>
neither
will
I
be
intimidate
by
the
large
majority
which
this
House
present
the
other
night
against
the
wish
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
I
will
support
no
great
measure
of
reform
which
do
not
include
the
ballot
among
its
clause
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
Mr.
Turnbull
throw
down
the
gauntlet
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
speak
for
two
hour
,
and
then
the
debate
be
adjourn
till
the
Monday
.
<EOS>
the
adjournment
be
move
by
an
independent
member
,
who
,
as
be
know
,
would
support
the
Government
,
and
at
once
receive
Mr.
Turnbull
's
assent
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
great
hurry
with
the
bill
,
and
it
be
feel
that
it
would
be
well
to
let
the
ferment
subside
.
<EOS>
enough
have
be
do
for
glory
when
Mr.
Mildmay
move
the
second
reading
,
and
quite
enough
in
the
way
of
debate
,
 
with
such
an
audience
almost
within
hearing
,
 
when
Mr.
Turnbull
's
speech
have
be
make
.
<EOS>
then
the
House
empty
itself
at
once
.
<EOS>
the
elderly
,
cautious
member
make
their
exit
through
the
peer
'
door
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
get
out
into
the
crowd
through
Westminster
Hall
,
and
be
push
about
among
the
rough
for
an
hour
or
so
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
make
his
way
through
the
hall
with
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
find
Mr.
Turnbull
's
carriage
wait
at
the
entrance
with
a
dozen
policeman
round
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
will
not
get
home
to
dinner
before
midnight
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
understand
all
about
it
,
"
say
Laurence
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
a
good
meal
at
three
,
before
he
leave
home
,
and
you
would
find
sandwich
and
sherry
in
plenty
if
you
be
to
search
his
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
know
how
to
remedy
the
cost
of
mob
popularity
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
that
time
poor
Bunce
be
be
hustle
about
in
the
crowd
in
the
vicinity
of
Mr.
Turnbull
's
carriage
.
<EOS>
Phineas
and
Fitzgibbon
make
their
way
out
,
and
by
degree
work
a
passage
for
themselves
into
Parliament
Street
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
have
be
somewhat
behind
them
in
come
down
the
hall
,
and
have
not
be
without
a
sense
of
enjoyment
in
the
ovation
which
be
be
give
to
him
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
be
wrong
in
what
he
be
do
.
<EOS>
that
affair
of
the
carriage
be
altogether
wrong
,
and
do
Mr.
Turnbull
much
harm
for
many
a
day
afterwards
.
<EOS>
when
he
get
outside
the
door
,
where
be
the
twelve
policeman
guard
his
carriage
,
a
great
number
of
his
admirer
endeavour
to
shake
hand
with
him
.
<EOS>
among
them
be
the
devoted
Bunce
.
<EOS>
but
the
policeman
seem
to
think
that
Mr.
Turnbull
be
to
be
guard
,
even
from
the
affection
of
his
friend
,
and
be
as
careful
that
he
should
be
usher
into
his
carriage
untouched
,
as
though
he
have
be
the
favourite
object
of
political
aversion
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
himself
,
when
he
begin
to
perceive
that
man
be
crowd
close
upon
the
gate
,
and
to
hear
the
noise
,
and
to
feel
,
as
it
be
,
the
breath
of
the
mob
,
step
on
quickly
into
his
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
say
a
word
or
two
in
a
loud
voice
.
"
<EOS>
thank
you
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
I
trust
you
may
obtain
all
your
just
demand
.
"
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
pause
to
speak
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
could
hardly
have
do
so
,
as
the
policeman
be
manifestly
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
the
carriage
be
get
away
at
a
snail
's
pace
;
 
but
there
remain
in
the
spot
where
the
carriage
have
stand
the
making
of
a
very
pretty
street
row
.
  
<EOS>
bunce
have
strive
hard
to
shake
hand
with
his
hero
,
 
Bunce
and
some
other
reformer
as
ardent
and
as
decent
as
himself
.
<EOS>
the
police
be
very
determinate
that
there
should
be
no
such
interruption
to
their
programme
for
get
Mr.
Turnbull
off
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunce
,
who
have
his
own
idea
as
to
his
right
to
shake
hand
with
any
gentleman
at
Westminster
Hall
who
may
choose
to
shake
hand
with
him
,
become
uneasy
under
the
impediment
that
be
place
in
his
way
,
and
express
himself
warmly
as
to
his
civil
right
.
<EOS>
now
a
London
policeman
in
a
political
row
be
,
I
believe
,
the
most
forbearing
of
man
.
<EOS>
so
long
as
he
meet
with
no
special
political
opposition
,
ordinary
ill
-
usage
do
not
even
put
him
out
of
temper
.
<EOS>
He
be
pay
for
rough
work
among
rough
,
and
take
his
rub
gallantly
.
<EOS>
but
he
feel
himself
to
be
an
instrument
for
the
moment
of
despotic
power
as
oppose
to
civil
right
,
and
he
will
not
stand
what
he
call
"
jaw
.
<EOS>
"
trip
up
a
policeman
in
such
a
scramble
,
and
he
will
take
it
in
good
spirit
;
but
mention
the
word
"
Habeas
Corpus
,
"
and
he
will
lock
you
up
if
he
can
.
<EOS>
as
a
rule
,
his
instinct
be
right
;
for
the
man
who
talk
about
"
Habeas
Corpus
"
in
a
political
crowd
will
generally
do
more
harm
than
can
be
effect
by
the
tripping
up
of
any
constable
.
<EOS>
but
these
instinct
may
be
the
mean
of
individual
injustice
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
be
so
when
Mr.
Bunce
be
arrest
and
keep
a
fast
prisoner
.
<EOS>
His
wife
have
show
her
knowledge
of
his
character
when
she
declare
that
he
would
be
"
take
"
if
any
one
be
"
take
.
"
  
<EOS>
bunce
be
take
into
custody
with
some
three
or
four
other
like
himself
,
 
decent
man
,
who
mean
no
harm
,
but
who
think
that
as
man
they
be
bind
to
show
their
political
opinion
,
perhaps
at
the
expense
of
a
little
martyrdom
,
 
and
be
carry
into
a
temporary
stronghold
,
which
have
be
provide
for
the
necessity
of
the
police
,
under
the
clock
-
tower
.
  
<EOS>
"
keep
me
,
at
your
peril
!
"
say
Bunce
,
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
mean
it
,
"
say
the
sergeant
who
have
him
in
custody
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
no
ha'porth
to
break
the
law
,
"
say
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
break
the
law
when
you
be
upset
my
man
,
as
I
see
you
,
"
say
the
sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
upset
nobody
,
"
say
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
rejoin
the
sergeant
;
"
you
can
say
it
all
before
the
magistrate
,
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
be
I
to
be
lock
up
all
night
?
"
say
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
you
will
,
"
reply
the
sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
Bunce
,
who
be
not
by
nature
a
very
talkative
man
,
say
no
more
;
but
he
swear
in
his
heart
that
there
should
be
vengeance
.
<EOS>
between
eleven
and
twelve
he
be
take
to
the
regular
police
-
station
,
and
from
thence
he
be
enable
to
send
word
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
bunce
have
be
take
,
"
say
she
,
with
something
of
the
tragic
queen
,
and
something
also
of
the
injure
wife
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
as
soon
as
Phineas
let
himself
in
with
the
latchkey
between
twelve
and
one
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
mingle
with
,
and
at
last
dominant
over
,
those
severer
tone
,
come
the
voice
of
the
loving
woman
whose
beloved
one
be
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
it
would
be
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
do
not
I
?
<EOS>
and
what
must
we
do
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
he
would
have
a
bit
to
eat
from
the
moment
he
go
out
;
 
and
as
for
a
drop
of
beer
,
he
never
think
of
it
,
except
what
I
put
down
for
him
at
his
meal
.
<EOS>
Them
nasty
police
always
take
the
good
.
<EOS>
that
be
why
I
be
so
afeard
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
say
all
that
he
could
to
comfort
her
,
and
promise
to
go
to
the
police
-
office
early
in
the
morning
and
look
after
Bunce
.
<EOS>
no
serious
evil
would
,
he
think
,
probably
come
of
it
;
but
still
Bunce
have
be
wrong
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
may
have
be
take
yourself
,
"
argue
Mrs.
Bunce
,
"
just
as
well
as
he
.
"
<EOS>
then
Phineas
explain
that
he
have
go
forth
in
the
execution
of
a
public
duty
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
have
be
take
,
all
the
same
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bunce
,
"
for
I
be
sure
Bunce
do
not
do
nothing
amiss
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
the
First
Speech
"
 
<EOS>
on
the
following
morning
,
which
be
Saturday
,
Phineas
be
early
at
the
police
-
office
at
Westminster
look
after
the
interest
of
his
landlord
;
but
there
have
be
a
considerable
number
of
man
take
up
during
the
row
,
and
our
friend
could
hardly
procure
that
attention
for
Mr.
Bunce
's
case
to
which
he
think
the
decency
of
his
client
and
his
own
position
as
a
member
of
Parliament
be
entitle
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
have
be
take
up
be
take
in
batch
before
the
magistrate
;
but
as
the
soldier
in
the
park
have
be
maltreat
,
and
a
considerable
injury
have
be
do
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Downing
Street
,
there
be
a
good
deal
of
strong
feeling
against
the
mob
,
and
the
magistrate
be
dispose
to
be
severe
.
<EOS>
if
decent
man
choose
to
go
out
among
such
companion
,
and
thereby
get
into
trouble
,
decent
man
must
take
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
during
the
Saturday
and
Sunday
a
very
strong
feeling
grow
up
against
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
the
story
of
the
carriage
be
tell
,
and
he
be
declare
to
be
a
turbulent
demagogue
,
only
desirous
of
get
popularity
.
<EOS>
and
together
with
this
feeling
there
arise
a
general
verdict
of
"
serve
them
right
"
against
all
who
have
come
into
contact
with
the
police
in
the
great
Turnbull
row
;
and
thus
it
come
to
pass
that
Mr.
Bunce
have
not
be
liberate
up
to
the
Monday
morning
.
<EOS>
on
the
Sunday
Mrs.
Bunce
be
in
hysteric
,
and
declare
her
conviction
that
Mr.
Bunce
would
be
imprison
for
life
.
<EOS>
Poor
Phineas
have
an
unquiet
time
with
her
on
the
morning
of
that
day
.
<EOS>
in
every
ecstasy
of
her
grief
she
throw
herself
into
his
arm
,
either
metaphorically
or
materially
,
accord
to
the
excess
of
her
agony
at
the
moment
,
and
express
repeatedly
an
assured
conviction
that
all
her
child
would
die
of
starvation
,
and
that
she
herself
would
be
pick
up
under
the
arch
of
one
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
be
soft
-
hearted
,
do
what
he
could
to
comfort
her
,
and
allow
himself
to
be
work
up
to
strong
parliamentary
anger
against
the
magistrate
and
police
.
<EOS>
"
when
they
think
that
they
have
public
opinion
on
their
side
,
there
be
nothing
in
the
way
or
arbitrary
excess
which
be
too
great
for
them

<EOS>
"
this
he
say
to
Barrington
Erle
,
who
anger
him
and
increase
the
warmth
of
his

Phineas

declare
to
himself
that

a
Liberal
at

that
he
may
find
Lady
Laura
Kennedy

<EOS>
He
have
come
to
understand

Lady
Laura

<EOS>
so
much
indeed
she

him
in
so
many
word

<EOS>
but
he
have
come
to
understand
also
,
without
any
plain
telling
,
that
she
rebel
in
heart
against
this
Sabbath
tyranny

and
that
she
would
escape
from
it
when
escape
be
possible

<EOS>
She
have
now
come
to
talk
to
her
father
about

her

<EOS>
They

walk
together
across
the
park

<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy

not
like
to
have
any
carriage
out
on
a
Sunday

and
to
this
arrangement
his
wife

well
not
be
move
for
a
month
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
that
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
They
always
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
it
not
be
good
for
him
to
remain
where
he
be
?
"
say
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
not
a
soul
to
speak
to
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
be
with
him
,
"
say
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
is
,
of
course
,
out
of
the
question
,
"
say
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
They
know
him
at
that
inn
,
and
it
really
seem
to
me
best
that
he
should
stay
there
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
he
would
be
so
much
at
his
ease
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
dreadful
for
a
man
to
be
confine
to
his
room
without
a
creature
near
him
,
except
the
servant
,
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
frown
,
but
say
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
They
all
perceive
that
as
soon
as
he
have
learn
that
there
be
no
real
danger
as
to
his
son
's
life
,
he
be
determine
that
this
accident
should
not
work
him
up
to
any
show
of
tenderness
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
hope
he
will
come
up
to
London
,
"
continue
Violet
,
who
be
not
afraid
of
the
Earl
,
and
be
determine
not
to
be
put
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
what
you
be
talk
about
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Lord
Brentford
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
Phineas
find
it
very
difficult
to
extract
any
sympathy
from
the
Earl
on
behalf
of
the
man
who
have
be
lock
up
.
<EOS>
He
be
moody
and
cross
,
and
could
not
be
induce
to
talk
on
the
great
subject
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
declare
that
she
do
not
care
how
many
bunce
be
lock
up
;
nor
for
how
long
,
 
add
,
however
,
a
wish
that
Mr.
Turnbull
himself
have
be
among
the
number
of
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
be
somewhat
soft
than
this
,
and
consent
to
express
pity
in
the
case
of
Mr.
Bunce
himself
;
but
Phineas
perceive
that
the
pity
be
award
to
him
and
not
to
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
the
feeling
against
Mr.
Turnbull
be
at
the
present
moment
so
strong
among
all
the
upper
class
,
that
Mr.
Bunce
and
his
brother
may
have
be
keep
in
durance
for
a
week
without
commiseration
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
hard
certainly
on
a
man
like
Mr.
Bunce
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
Mr.
Bunce
stay
at
home
and
mind
his
business
?
"
say
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
spend
the
remainder
of
that
day
alone
,
and
come
to
a
resolution
that
on
the
come
occasion
he
certainly
would
speak
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
the
debate
would
be
resume
on
the
Monday
,
and
he
would
rise
to
his
leg
on
the
very
first
moment
that
it
become
possible
for
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
and
he
would
do
nothing
towards
prepare
a
speech
;
 
<EOS>
nothing
whatever
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
he
would
trust
entirely
to
such
word
as
may
come
to
him
at
the
moment
;
 
ay
,
and
to
such
thought
.
<EOS>
He
have
before
burden
his
memory
with
preparation
,
and
the
very
weight
of
the
burden
have
be
too
much
for
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
have
fear
to
trust
himself
to
speak
,
because
he
have
feel
that
he
be
not
capable
of
perform
the
double
labour
of
say
his
lesson
by
heart
,
and
of
face
the
House
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
there
should
be
nothing
now
for
him
to
remember
.
<EOS>
His
thought
be
full
of
his
subject
.
<EOS>
He
would
support
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
with
all
his
eloquence
,
but
he
would
implore
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
the
Home
Secretary
,
and
the
Government
generally
,
to
abstain
from
animosity
against
the
populace
of
London
,
because
they
desire
one
special
boon
which
Mr.
Mildmay
do
not
think
that
it
be
his
duty
to
give
them
.
<EOS>
He
hope
that
idea
and
word
would
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
idea
and
word
have
be
free
enough
with
him
in
the
old
day
of
the
Dublin
debate
society
.
<EOS>
if
they
fail
him
now
,
he
must
give
the
thing
up
,
and
go
back
to
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Monday
morning
Phineas
be
for
two
hour
at
the
police
-
court
in
Westminster
,
and
at
about
one
on
that
day
Mr.
Bunce
be
liberate
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
bring
up
before
the
magistrate
,
Mr.
Bunce
speak
his
mind
very
freely
as
to
the
usage
he
have
receive
,
and
declare
his
intention
of
bring
an
action
against
the
sergeant
who
have
detain
him
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
,
of
course
,
take
the
part
of
the
police
,
and
declare
that
,
from
the
evidence
of
two
man
who
be
examine
,
Bunce
have
certainly
use
such
violence
in
the
crowd
as
have
justify
his
arrest
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
use
no
violence
,
"
say
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
accord
to
your
own
showing
,
you
endeavour
to
make
your
way
up
to
Mr.
Turnbull
's
carriage
,
"
say
the
magistrate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
close
to
the
carriage
before
the
police
even
see
me
,
"
say
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
try
to
force
your
way
round
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
use
no
force
till
a
man
have
me
by
the
collar
to
push
me
back
;
and
I
be
not
violent
,
not
then
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
do
what
I
have
a
right
to
do
,
 
and
<EOS>
it
be
that
as
make
him
hang
on
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
do
what
you
have
a
right
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
be
assist
to
create
a
riot
,
"
say
the
magistrate
,
with
that
indignation
which
a
London
magistrate
should
always
know
how
to
affect
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
however
,
be
allow
to
give
evidence
as
to
his
landlord
's
character
,
and
then
Bunce
be
liberate
.
<EOS>
but
before
he
go
he
again
swear
that
that
should
not
be
the
last
of
it
,
and
he
tell
the
magistrate
that
he
have
be
ill

use
.
<EOS>
when
liberate
,
he
be
join
by
a
dozen
sympathising
friend
,
who
escort
him
home
,
and
among
them
be
one
or
two
literary

employ
on
those
excellent
penny
paper
,
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
and
the
_
Ballot

box
_
.
<EOS>
It
be
their
intention
that
Mr.
Bunce
's
case
should
not
be
allow
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
one
of
these
gentleman
make
a
distinct
offer
to
Phineas
Finn
of
unbounded
popularity
during
life
and
of
immortality
afterwards
,
if
he
,
as
a
member
of
Parliament
,
would
take
up
Bunce
's
case
with
vigour
.
<EOS>
phineas
,
not
quite
understand
the
nature
of
the
offer
,
and
not
as
yet
know
the
profession
of
the
gentleman
,
give
some
general
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
come
out
strong

Mr.

and
we
will
see
that
you

<EOS>
I
be
on
the

sir
,
and
I
will
answer
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
have
be
somewhat
eager
in
express
his
sympathy
with
Bunce
,
and
have
not
give
very
close
attention
to
the
gentleman
who
be
address
him
,
be
still
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
the
nature
of
the
_
Banner
_
,
which
the
gentleman
be
on
,
do
not
at
once
come
home
to
him

<EOS>
"
something
ought
to
be
do
,
certainly
,
"
say
Phineas

<EOS>
"
We
shall
take
it
up
strong
,
"
say
the
gentleman
,
"
and
we
shall
be
happy
to
have
you

<EOS>
You
will
find
,
Mr.

,
that
in
public

there
be
nothing

"
  
<EOS>
then
Phineas
understand
the
nature
of
the
offer
make
to
him

<EOS>
as

Mr.

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
be
a
young
man
,
under
thirty
,
not
remarkable
for
clean
linen
,
and
who
always
talk
of
the
"
'
ouse
.
<EOS>
"
but
he
be
a
well
-
know
and
not
undistinguished
member
of
a
powerful
class
of
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
reporter
,
and
as
such
know
the
"
'
ouse
"
well
,
and
be
a
writer
for
the
press
.
<EOS>
and
,
though
he
talk
of
"
'
ouse
"
and
"
horgan
"
,
he
write
good
English
with
great
rapidity
,
and
be
possess
of
that
special
sort
of
political
fervour
which
show
itself
in
a
man
's
work
rather
than
in
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mr.
Slide
's
taste
to
be
an
advanced
reformer
,
and
in
all
his
operation
on
behalf
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
he
be
a
reformer
very
much
advanced
.
<EOS>
no
man
could
do
an
article
on
the
people
's
indefeasible
right
with
more
pronounced
vigour
than
Mr.
Slide
.
<EOS>
but
it
have
never
occur
to
him
as
yet
that
he
ought
to
care
for
anything
else
than
the
fight
,
 
than
the
advantage
of
have
a
good
subject
on
which
to
write
slash
article
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slide
be
an
energetic
but
not
a
thoughtful
man
;
but
in
his
thought
on
politic
,
as
far
as
they
go
with
him
,
he
regard
the
wrong
of
the
people
as
be
of
infinitely
great
value
than
their
right
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
he
be
insincere
in
all
that
he
be
daily
say
;
 
but
simply
that
he
never
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
very
early
in
life
he
have
fall
among
"
people
's
friend
,
"
and
an
opening
on
the
liberal
press
have
come
in
his
way

<EOS>
to
be
a
"
people
's
friend
"
suit
the
turn
of
his
ambition
,
and
he
be
a
"
people
's
friend
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
his
business
to
abuse
government
,
and
to
express
on
all
occasion
an
opinion
that
as
a
matter
of
course
the
rule
power
be
the
"
people
's
enemy

"
<EOS>
have
the
rule
power
cease
to
be
the
"
people

enemy
,
"
Mr.
Slide
's
ground
would
have
be
take
from
under
his
foot
.
<EOS>
but
such
a
catastrophe
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
that
excellent
old
arrangement
that
have
go
on
since
demagogue
be
first
invent
be
in
full
vigour
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
rule
power
and
there
be
the
people
,
 
devil
on
one
side
and
angel
on
the
other

and
as
long
as
a
people
's
friend
have
a
pen
in
his
hand
<EOS>
all
be
right
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
when
he
leave
the
indignant
Bunce
to
go
among
his
friend
,
walk
to
the
House
think
a
good
deal
of
what
Mr.
Slide
have
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
potted
pea
Committee
be
again
on
,
and
he
have
intend
to
be
in
the
Committee
Room
by
twelve
punctually
:
but
he
have
be
unable
to
leave
Mr.
Bunce
in
the
lurch
,
and
it
be
now
past
one
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
,
from
one
unfortunate
circumstance
after
another
,
fail
hitherto
in
give
to
the
pot
pea
that
resolute
attention
which
the
subject
demand
.
<EOS>
on
the
present
occasion
his
mind
be
full
of
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
and
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
be
there
not
something
in
Mr.
Slide
's
proposition
?
<EOS>
He
,
Phineas
,
have
come
into
Parliament
as
it
be
under
the
wing
of
a
Government
pack
,
and
his
friendship
,
which
have
be
very
successful
,
have
be
make
with
minister
,
and
with
the
friend
of
Ministers
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
up
his
mind
to
be
Whig
Ministerial
,
and
to
look
for
his
profession
in
that
line
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
specially
fortify
in
this
resolution
by
his
dislike
to
the
ballot
,
 
which
dislike
have
be
the
result
of
Mr.
Monk
's
teaching
.
<EOS>
have
Mr.
Turnbull
become
his
friend
instead
<EOS>
,
it
may
well
be
that
he
would
have
like
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
on
such
subject
man
must
think
long
,
and
be
sure
that
they
have
think
in
earnest
,
before
they
be
justified
in
say
that
their
opinion
be
the
result
of
their
own
thought
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
begin
to
reflect
how
far
this
ministerial
profession
would
suit
him
.
<EOS>
Would
it
be
much
to
be
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
,
subject
to
the
dominion
of
Mr.
Ratler
?
<EOS>
such
lordship
and
such
subjection
would
be
the
result
of
success
.
<EOS>
He
tell
himself
that
he
be
at
heart
a
true
Liberal
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
well
for
him
to
abandon
the
idea
of
office
trammel
,
and
go
among
them
on
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
?
<EOS>
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
come
over
him
as
he
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
what
would
violet
Effingham
say
to
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
and
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
?
<EOS>
and
he
would
have
like
the
_
Banner
_
<EOS>
better
have
not
Mr.
Slide
talk
about
the
'
ouse
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
Committee
Room
,
in
which
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
take
no
active
part
in
reference
to
the
pot
pea
,
he
go
down
to
the
House
,
and
be
present
when
the
debate
be
resume
.
<EOS>
not
unnaturally
,
one
speaker
after
another
make
some
allusion
to
the
row
in
the
street
,
and
the
work
which
have
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
have
declare
that
he
would
vote
against
the
second
reading
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
,
and
have
explain
that
he
would
do
so
because
he
could
consent
to
no
Reform
Bill
which
do
not
include
the
ballot
as
one
of
its
measure
.
<EOS>
the
debate
fashion
itself
after
this
speech
of
Mr.
Turnbull
's
,
and
turn
again
very
much
upon
the
ballot
,
 
although
it
have
be
think
that
the
late
debate
have
settle
that
question
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
of
Mr.
Turnbull
's
follower
declare
that
they
also
would
vote
against
the
bill
,
 
of
course
,
as
not
go
far
enough
;
and
one
or
two
gentleman
from
the
conservative
bench
extend
a
spoken
welcome
to
these
new
colleague
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Palliser
get
up
and
address
the
House
for
an
hour
,
struggle
hard
to
bring
back
the
real
subject
,
and
to
make
the
House
understand
that
the
ballot
,
whether
good
or
bad
,
have
be
knock
on
the
head
,
and
that
member
have
no
right
at
the
present
moment
to
consider
anything
but
the
expediency
or
inexpediency
of
so
much
Reform
as
Mr.
Mildmay
present
to
them
in
the
present
bill
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
be
determine
to
speak
,
and
to
speak
on
this
evening
if
he
could
catch
the
Speaker
's
eye
.
<EOS>
again
the
scene
before
him
be
go
round
before
him
;
again
thing
become
dim
,
and
again
he
feel
his
blood
beat
hard
at
his
heart
.
<EOS>
but
thing
be
not
so
bad
with
him
as
they
have
be
before
,
because
he
have
nothing
to
remember
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
know
,
indeed
,
what
he
intend
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
have
an
idea
that
he
be
desirous
of
join
in
earnest
support
of
the
measure
,
with
a
vehement
protest
against
the
injustice
which
have
be
do
to
the
people
in
general
,
and
to
Mr.
Bunce
in
particular
.
<EOS>
He
have
firmly
resolve
that
no
fear
of
lose
favour
with
the
Government
should
induce
him
to
hold
his
tongue
as
to
the
buncean
cruelty
.
<EOS>
sooner
than
do
<EOS>
so
he
would
certainly
"
go
among
them
"
at
the
_
Banner
_
office
.
  
<EOS>
He
start
up
,
wildly
,
when
Mr.
Palliser
have
complete
his
speech
;
but
the
Speaker
's
eye
,
not
unnaturally
,
have
travel
to
the
other
side
of
the
House
,
and
there
be
a
Tory
of
the
old
school
upon
his
leg
,
 
Mr.
Western
,
the
member
for
East
Barsetshire
,
one
of
the
gallant
few
who
dare
to
vote
against
Sir
Robert
Peel
's
bill
for
repeal
the
Corn
Laws
in
1846
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Western
speak
with
a
slow
,
ponderous
,
unimpressive
,
but
very
audible
voice
,
for
some
twenty
minute
,
disdain
to
make
reference
to
Mr.
Turnbull
and
his
politic
,
but
plead
against
any
Reform
,
with
all
the
old
argument
.
<EOS>
Phineas
do
not
hear
a
word
that
he
say
;
 
do
not
attempt
to
hear
.
<EOS>
He
be
keen
in
his
resolution
to
make
another
attempt
at
the
Speaker
's
eye
,
and
at
the
present
moment
be
think
of
that
,
and
of
that
only
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
even
give
himself
a
moment
's
reflection
as
to
what
his
own
speech
should
be
.
<EOS>
He
would
dash
at
it
and
take
his
chance
,
resolve
that
at
least
he
would
not
fail
in
courage
.
<EOS>
twice
he
be
on
his
leg
before
Mr.
Western
have
finish
his
slow
harangue
,
and
twice
he
be
compel
to
reseat
himself
,
 
think
that
he
have
subject
himself
to
ridicule
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
member
for
East
Barset
sit
down
,
and
Phineas
be
conscious
that
he
have
lose
a
moment
or
two
in
present
himself
again
to
the
Speaker
.
  
<EOS>
He
hold
his
ground
,
however
,
though
he
see
that
he
have
various
rival
for
the
right
of
speech
.
<EOS>
He
hold
his
ground
,
and
be
instantly
aware
that
he
have
gain
his
point
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
slight
pause
,
and
as
some
other
urgent
member
do
not
reseat
himself
,
Phineas
hear
the
president
of
that
august
assembly
call
upon
himself
to
address
the
House
.
<EOS>
the
thing
be
now
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
there
he
be
with
the
House
of
Commons
at
his
foot
,
 
a
crowd
House
,
bind
to
be
his
auditor
as
long
as
he
should
think
fit
to
address
them
,
and
reporter
by
ten
and
twenty
in
the
gallery
ready
and
eager
to
let
the
country
know
what
the
young
member
for
Loughshane
would
say
in
this
his
maiden
speech
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
have
sundry
gift
,
a
powerful
and
pleasant
voice
,
which
he
have
learn
to
modulate
,
a
handsome
presence
,
and
a
certain
natural
mixture
of
modesty
and
self
-
reliance
,
which
would
certainly
protect
him
from
the
fault
of
arrogance
and
pomposity
,
and
which
,
perhaps
,
may
carry
him
through
the
peril
of
his
new
position
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
also
the
great
advantage
of
friend
in
the
House
who
be
anxious
that
he
should
do
well
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
that
gift
of
slow
blood
which
on
the
former
occasion
would
have
enable
him
to
remember
his
prepared
speech
,
and
which
would
now
have
place
all
his
own
resource
within
his
own
reach
.
<EOS>
He
begin
with
the
expression
of
an
opinion
that
every
true
reformer
ought
to
accept
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
,
even
if
it
be
accept
only
as
an
instalment
,
 
but
before
he
have
get
through
these
sentence
,
he
become
painfully
conscious
that
he
be
repeat
his
own
word
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
cheer
almost
from
the
outset
,
and
yet
he
know
as
he
go
on
that
he
be
fail
.
<EOS>
He
have
certain
argument
at
his
finger
'
end
,
 
point
with
which
he
be
,
in
truth
,
so
familiar
that
he
nee
hardly
have
trouble
himself
to
arrange
them
for
special
use
,
 
and
he
forget
even
these
.
<EOS>
He
find
that
he
be
go
on
with
one
platitude
after
another
as
to
the
benefit
of
reform
,
in
a
manner
that
would
have
shame
him
six
or
seven
year
ago
at
a
debate
club
.
<EOS>
He
press
on
,
fear
that
word
would
fail
him
altogether
if
he
pause
;
 
but
he
do
in
truth
speak
very
much
too
fast
,
knock
his
word
together
so
that
no
reporter
could
properly
catch
them
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
nothing
to
say
for
the
bill
except
what
hundred
have
say
before
,
and
hundred
would
say
again
.
<EOS>
still
he
be
cheer
,
and
still
he
go
on
;
and
as
he
become
more
and
more
conscious
of
his
failure
there
grow
upon
him
the
idea
,
 
the
dangerous
hope
,
that
he
may
still
save
himself
from
ignominy
by
the
eloquence
of
his
invective
against
the
police
.
  
<EOS>
He
try
it
,
and
succeed
thoroughly
in
make
the
House
understand
that
he
be
very
angry
,
 
but
he
succeed
in
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
catch
the
word
to
express
the
thought
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
explain
his
idea
that
the
people
out
of
the
House
have
as
much
right
to
express
their
opinion
in
favour
of
the
ballot
as
member
in
the
House
have
to
express
theirs
against
it
;
and
that
animosity
have
be
show
to
the
people
by
the
authority
because
they
have
so
express
their
opinion
.
<EOS>
then
he
attempt
to
tell
the
story
of
Mr.
Bunce
in
a
light
and
airy
way
,
fail
,
and
sit
down
in
the
middle
of
it
.
<EOS>
again
he
be
cheer
by
all
around
him
,
 
cheer
as
a
new
member
be
usually
cheer
,
 
and
in
the
midst
of
the
cheer
would
have
blow
out
his
brain
<EOS>
have
there
be
a
pistol
there
ready
for
such
an
operation
.
  
<EOS>
that
hour
with
him
be
very
bad
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
how
to
get
up
and
go
away
,
or
how
to
keep
his
place
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
he
sit
with
his
hat
off
,
forgetful
of
his
privilege
of
wear
it
;
and
then
put
it
on
hurriedly
,
as
though
the
fact
of
his
not
wear
it
must
have
be
observe
by
everybody
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
at
about
two
,
the
debate
be
adjourn
,
and
then
as
he
be
slowly
leave
the
House
,
think
how
he
may
creep
away
without
companionship
,
Mr.
Monk
take
him
by
the
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
to
walk
?
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
"
,
say
Phineas
;
"
I
shall
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
we
may
go
together
as
far
as
Pall
Mall
.
<EOS>
come
along
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
have
no
means
of
escape
,
and
leave
the
House
hang
on
Mr.
Monk
's
arm
,
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
nor
do
Mr.
Monk
speak
till
they
be
out
in
Palace
Yard
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
much
amiss
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
;
"
<EOS>
but
you
will
do
better
than
that
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Monk
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
I
have
make
an
ass
of
myself
so
thoroughly
,
that
there
will
at
any
rate
be
this
good
result
,
that
I
shall
never
make
an
ass
of
myself
again
after
the
same
fashion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
some
such
feeling
as
that
,
and
therefore
I
be
determined
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
,
Finn
,
that
I
do
not
care
to
flatter
you
,
and
I
think
you
ought
to
know
that
,
as
far
as
I
be
able
,
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Your
speech
,
which
be
certainly
nothing
great
,
be
about
on
a
par
with
other
maiden
speech
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
You
have
do
yourself
neither
good
nor
harm
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
desirable
that
you
should
.
<EOS>
My
advice
to
you
now
be
,
never
to
avoid
speak
on
any
subject
that
interest
you
,
but
never
to
speak
for
above
three
minute
till
you
find
yourself
as
much
at
home
on
your
leg
as
you
be
when
sit
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
suppose
that
you
have
make
an
ass
of
yourself
,
 
that
is
,
in
any
special
degree
.
<EOS>
now
,
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Phineas
discuss
 
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
hear
two
account
of
her
friend
's
speech
,
 
and
both
from
man
who
have
be
present
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
be
in
his
place
,
in
accordance
with
his
constant
practice
,
and
Lord
Brentford
have
be
seat
,
perhaps
unfortunately
,
in
the
peer
'
gallery
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
think
it
be
a
failure
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
say
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
be
not
a
success
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
particular
about
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
deal
of
it
you
could
hardly
hear
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
she
get
the
morning
newspaper
,
and
turn
with
great
interest
to
the
report
.
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
have
be
,
as
it
be
,
adopt
by
her
as
her
own
political
offspring
,
 
or
at
any
rate
as
her
political
godchild
.
<EOS>
She
have
make
promise
on
his
behalf
to
various
personage
of
high
political
standing
,
 
to
her
father
,
to
Mr.
Monk
,
to
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
and
even
to
Mr.
Mildmay
himself
.
<EOS>
She
have
thoroughly
intend
that
Phineas
Finn
should
be
a
political
success
from
the
first
;
and
since
her
marriage
,
she
have
,
I
think
,
be
more
intent
upon
it
than
before
.
<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
a
feeling
on
her
part
that
have
wrong
him
in
one
way
,
she
would
repay
him
in
another
.
<EOS>
She
have
become
so
eager
for
his
success
,
 
for
a
while
scorn
to
conceal
her
feeling
,
 
that
her
husband
have
unconsciously
begin
to
entertain
a
dislike
to
her
eagerness
.
<EOS>
We
know
how
quickly
woman
arrive
at
an
understanding
of
the
feeling
of
those
with
whom
they
live
;
and
now
,
on
that
very
occasion
,
Lady
Laura
perceive
that
her
husband
do
not
take
in
good
part
her
anxiety
on
behalf
of
her
friend
.
<EOS>
She
see
that
it
be
so
as
she
turn
over
the
newspaper
look
for
the
report
of
the
speech
.
<EOS>
It
be
give
in
six
line
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
there
be
an
intimation
,
 
express
in
the
shape
of
advice
,
 
that
the
young
orator
have
better
speak
more
slowly
if
he
wish
to
be
efficacious
either
with
the
House
or
with
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
seem
to
have
be
cheer
a
good
deal
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
member
be
cheer
at
their
first
speech
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
he
will
do
well
yet
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
likely
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
then
he
turn
to
his
newspaper
,
and
do
not
take
his
eye
off
it
as
long
as
his
wife
remain
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
later
in
the
day
Lady
Laura
see
her
father
,
and
Miss
Effingham
be
with
her
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
say
something
which
indicate
that
he
have
hear
the
debate
on
the
previous
evening
,
and
Lady
Laura
instantly
begin
to
ask
him
about
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
less
say
the
well
,
"
be
the
Earl
's
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
that
it
be
so
bad
as
that
?
"
ask
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
very
bad
at
first
;
 
though
indeed
nobody
could
say
it
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
but
he
get
himself
into
a
mess
about
the
police
and
the
magistrate
before
he
have
do
,
and
nothing
but
the
kindly
feeling
always
show
to
a
first
effort
save
him
from
be
cough
down
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
not
a
word
more
to
say
about
Phineas
to
her
father
;
but
,
womanlike
,
she
resolve
that
she
would
not
abandon
him
.
<EOS>
how
many
first
failure
in
the
world
have
be
the
precursor
of
ultimate
success
!
"
<EOS>
Mildmay
will
lose
his
bill
,
"
say
the
Earl
,
sorrowfully
.
<EOS>
"
there
do
not
seem
to
be
a
doubt
about
that
.
"
  
"
and
what
will
you
all
do
?
"
ask
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
go
to
the
country
,
I
suppose
,
"
say
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
use
?
<EOS>
You
can
not
have
a
more
liberal
House
than
you
have
now
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
may
have
one
less
liberal
,
 
or
rather
less
radical
,
 
with
few
man
to
support
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
what
else
we
can
do
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
there
be
no
less
than
twenty
-
seven
man
on
our
side
of
the

every

to
lose
his

what
can
we
do
?
<EOS>
how
be
the
Queen
's
Government
to
be
carry
on
?
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
the
sad
earnestness

impress
itself
on
the
Earl

brow
as
he
ask
these
momentous
question

I

a
Ministry

Mr.

in

he
may

He

it
by

accident

You
must
find
him
a
seat
somewhere
in
England

Violet

that
may
be
difficult

the
two

remain
together
for

quarter

hour

again

then
Lady

say
something
about
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
a
dissolution
,
I
hope
Oswald
will
stand
for
Loughton

<EOS>
"
Loughton
be
a
borough
close
to
Saulsby
,
in
which
,
as
regard
its
political
interest
,
Lord
Brentford
be
suppose
to
have
considerable
influence

to
this
Violet

nothing

It

quite
time

continue
Lady

that
old

He
have
have
the

twenty

five

He

he

no

he

he

nearly
eighty

I

Would
not
that
be
just
the
place

Lady

become

serious

<EOS>
"
Oswald
would
of
course
have
a
well
right

it

anybody
else

would
Lord

go
into
Parliament

I
have
hear

change
his

there

again
silence
for
a
few
moment

after

Violet
return
to

It
would
be
a
thousand
pity

so
should
I
,
 
and
the
more
so
from
what
Lord
Brentford
say
about
his
not
speak
well
last
night
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
it
be
very
much
of
an
accomplishment
for
a
gentleman
to
speak
well
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
,
I
suppose
,
speak
well
;

they
say
that
that
horrid
man
,
Mr.
Bonteen
,
can
talk
by
the
hour
together

<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
it
show
a
man

be
clever

I
believe
Mr.

would
do
it
,
if
he
set
his
mind
to
it

I
shall
think
it
a
great
shame

they
turn
him
out

It
would
depend
very
much

I

on

I
do
not

anything

Violet

I
be
quite
sure
that
he
may
have
Loughton
,
if
we
manage
it
properly

<EOS>
of
course
Lord
Chiltern
should
have
it
if
he
want
it

I
do
not

stand
in
Mr.

<EOS>

I
be
afraid
it
be
out
of
the
question

gravely

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
papa
think
so
much
about

<EOS>
the
reader
will
remember
that
both
Lord

thorough

<EOS>
the

spirit

spirit

not
that
kind
of
spirit
which
make
some
man
think

be
the
fine
thing
go

<EOS>
His
manner
be
perfect

chesterfieldian

yet
never
offensive

He
never
browbeat
any
one

never
toady
any

He
know
how
to
live
easily
with
man
of
all
rank

without
any
appearance

claim
a
special
status
for
himself

if

Archbishop

Canterbury

morrow

I

he
would
settle
down
into
the
place

without
false
shame

why
odd

"
  
<EOS>
"
simply
because
mine
be

they
the

I
once
think

<EOS>
Lady

sit
for

<EOS>
She
sit
with
her
elbow
on
the
table

with
her
face
lean
on
her
hand

think
how
far
it
would
tend
to
her
comfort
if
she
speak
in
true
confidence

<EOS>
violet
during
the
time
never
take
her
eye
from

remain
silent
as
though
wait
for
an
answer

<EOS>
She
have
be
very
explicit
as
to
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
Would
Laura
Kennedy
be
equally
explicit
?
<EOS>
She
be
too
clever
to
forget
that
such
plainness
of
speech
would
be
,
must
be
more
difficult
to
Lady
Laura
than
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
be
a
married
woman

she
feel
that
her
friend
would
have
be
wrong
to
search
for
secret
,
unless
she
be
ready
to
tell
her
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
probably
some
such
feeling
which
make
Lady
Laura
speak
at
last

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

I
do

nearly

so
selfish

that

<EOS>
"
for
what
reason
then

Lord
Chiltern
when
ride
his
horse
,
and
pretend
to
be
a
proper
associate
for
a
man
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
why
,
 
what
be
his
income
?
<EOS>
what
his
birth
?
<EOS>
what
his
proper
position
?
<EOS>
and
now
he
have
get
the
reward
which
all
cheat
deserve
.
<EOS>
then
he
go
to
bed
,
and
as
he
lie
there
,
he
think
of
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
have
he
plight
his
troth
to
Mary
,
and
then
work
like
a
slave
under
Mr.
Low
's
auspex
,
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
have
be
a
cheat
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
that
he
have
hardly
be
asleep
when
the
girl
come
into
his
room
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
there
be
that
gentleman
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
gentleman
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
Phineas
know
that
Mr.
Clarkson
be
in
his
sitting
-
room
,
and
that
he
would
not
leave
it
till
he
have
see
the
owner
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
nay
,
 
Phineas
be
pretty
sure
that
Mr.
Clarkson
would
come
into
the
bedroom
,
if
he
be
keep
long
wait
.
<EOS>
"
damn
the
old
gentleman
,
"
say
Phineas
in
his
wrath
;
 
and
the
maid
-
servant
hear
him
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
in
about
twenty
minute
he
go
out
into
the
sitting
-
room
,
with
his
slipper
on
and
in
his
dressing
-
gown
.
<EOS>
suffer
under
the
circumstance
of
such
an
emergency
,
how
be
any
man
to
go
through
the
work
of
dress
and
washing
with
proper
exactness
?
<EOS>
as
to
the
prayer
which
he
say
on
that
morning
,
I
think
that
no
question
should
be
ask
.
<EOS>
He
come
out
with
a
black
cloud
on
his
brow
,
and
with
his
mind
half
make
up
to
kick
Mr.
Clarkson
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
,
when
he
see
him
,
move
his
chin
round
within
his
white
cravat
,
as
be
a
custom
with
him
,
and
put
his
thumb
and
forefinger
on
his
lip
,
and
then
shake
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
bad
,
Mr.
Finn
;
very
bad
indeed
;
very
bad
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
come
here
in
this
way
at
all
time
in
the
day
be
very
bad
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
where
would
you
have
me
go
?
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to

<EOS>
to
tell

<EOS>
"
I
have
not

continue
Mr.

I
have
not

Phineas

<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
again
twitch
his
chin
about
on
the
top
of
his
cravat

smile
.

<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
I
would
do
anything

if
you
be
punctual

<EOS>
I
would
indeed

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
,
as
he
say
this
,
sit
down
in
the
chair
which
have
be
place
for
our
hero
's
breakfast
,
and
cut
a
slice
off
the
loaf
,
begin
to
butter
it
with
great
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Clarkson
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
I
can
not
ask
you
to
breakfast
here
.
<EOS>
I
be
engage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
just
take
a
bit
of
bread
and
butter
all
the
same
,
"
say
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
"
where
do
you
get
your
butter
?
<EOS>
now
I
could
tell
you
a
woman
who
'd
give
it
you
cheap
and
a
deal
well
than
this
.
<EOS>
this
be
all

Shall
I
send

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
tea
ready
,
and
therefore
Mr.
Clarkson
empty
the
milk
into
a
cup
and
drank
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
this
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
I
must
beg
,
Mr.

that
you

never

"
the

House

the

thing
to
me
,
"
say
Mr.

.
<EOS>
"
They
know
me
there
well
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
be
punctual
,
and
then
we
would
be
the
good
of
friend

<EOS>
"
after
that
Mr.
Clarkson
,
have
finish
his
bread
and
butter
,
take
his
leave
.
   
<EOS>
the
second
reading
be
carry
 
<EOS>
the
debate
on
the
bill
be
prolong
during
the
whole
of
that
week
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
,
who
love
his
seat
in
the
Cabinet
and
the
glory
of
be
a
Minister
,
better
even
than
he
love
his
borough
,
have
take
a
gloomy
estimate
when
he
speak
of
twenty
-
seven
defaulter
,
and
of
the
bill
as
certainly
lose
.
<EOS>
man
who
be
better
able
than
he
to
make
estimate
,
 
the
Bonteens
and
Fitzgibbons
on
each
side
of
the
House
,
and
above
all
,
the
Ratlers
and
Robys
,
produce
list
from
day
to
day
which
vary
now
by
three
name
in
one
direction
,
then
by
two
in
another
,
and
which
fluctuate
at
last
by
unit
only
.
<EOS>
They
all
concur
in
declare
that
it
would
be
a
very
near
division
.
<EOS>
a
great
effort
be
make
to
close
the
debate
on
the
Friday
,
but
it
fail
,
and
the
full
tide
of
speech
be
carry
on
till
the
follow
Monday
.
<EOS>
on
that
morning
Phineas
hear
Mr.
Ratler
declare
at
the
club
that
,
as
far
as
his
judgment
go
,
the
division
at
that
moment
be
a
fair
subject
for
a
bet
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
two
man
doubtful
in
the
House
,
"
say
Ratler
,
"
and
if
one
vote
on
one
side
and
one
on
the
other
,
or
if
neither
vote
at
all
,
it
will
be
a
tie
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Roby
,
however
,
the
whip
on
the
other
side
,
be
quite
sure
that
one
at
least
of
these
gentleman
would
go
into
his
lobby
,
and
that
the
other
would
not
go
into
Mr.
Ratler
's
lobby
.
<EOS>
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
town
be
generally
inclined
to
put
more
confidence
in
the
accuracy
of
Mr.
Roby
than
in
that
of
Mr.
Ratler
;
and
among
bet
man
there
certainly
be
a
point
give
by
those
who
back
the
Conservatives
.
<EOS>
the
odd
,
however
,
be
lose
,
for
on
the
division
the
number
in
the
two
lobby
be
equal
,
and
the
Speaker
give
his
cast
vote
in
favour
of
the
Government
.
<EOS>
the
bill
be
read
a
second
time
,
and
be
lose
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
in
reference
to
any
subsequent
action
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Roby
declare
that
even
Mr.
Mildmay
could
not
go
on
with
nothing
but
the
Speaker
's
vote
to
support
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
have
no
doubt
feel
that
he
could
not
go
on
with
his
bill
from
the
moment
in
which
Mr.
Turnbull
have
declare
his
opposition
;
but
he
could
not
with
propriety
withdraw
it
in
deference
to
Mr.
Turnbull
's
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
week
Phineas
have
have
his
hand
sufficiently
full
.
<EOS>
twice
he
have
go
to
the
potted
pea
inquiry
;
but
he
have
be
at
the
office
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
more
often
than
that
.
<EOS>
bunce
have
be
very
resolute
in
his
determination
to
bring
an
action
against
the
police
for
false
imprisonment
,
even
though
he
spend
every
shilling
of
his
saving
in
do
so
.
<EOS>
and
when
his
wife
,
in
the
presence
of
Phineas
,
beg
that
bygone
may
be
bygone
,
remind
him
that
spilt
milk
could
not
be
recover
,
he
call
her
a
mean
-
spirited
woman
.
<EOS>
then
Mrs.
Bunce
weep
a
flood
of
tear
,
and
tell
her
favourite
lodger
that
for
her
all
comfort
in
this
world
be
over
.
"
<EOS>
Drat
the
reformer
<EOS>
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
and
I
wish
there
be
no
Parliament
;
so
I
do
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
all
the
voting
,
when
it
mean
nothing
but
dry
bread
and
cross
word
?
<EOS>
"
phineas
by
no
means
encourage
his
landlord
in
his
litigious
spirit
,
advise
him
rather
to
keep
his
money
in
his
pocket
,
and
leave
the
fighting
of
the
battle
to
the
column
of
the
_
Banner
_
,
 
which
would
fight
it
,
at
any
rate
,
with
economy
.
<EOS>
but
Bunce
,
though
he
delight
in
the
_
Banner
_
,
and
show
an
unfortunate
readiness
to
sit
at
the
foot
of
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
,
would
have
his
action
at
law
;
 
in
which
resolution
Mr.
Slide
do
,
I
fear
,
encourage
him
behind
the
back
of
his
well
friend
,
Phineas
Finn
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
go
with
Bunce
to
Mr.
Low
's
chamber
,
 
for
Mr.
Low
have
in
some
way
become
acquaint
with
the
law
-
stationer
's
journeyman
,
 
and
there
some
very
good
advice
be
give
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
ask
yourself
what
be
your
object
,
Mr.
Bunce
?
"
say
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunce
declare
he
have
ask
himself
that
question
,
and
have
answer
it
.
<EOS>
His
object
be
redress
.
<EOS>
"
in
the
shape
of
compensation
to
yourself
,
"
suggest
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
no
;
Mr.
Bunce
would
not
admit
that
he
personally
require
any
compensation
.
<EOS>
the
redress
want
be
punishment
to
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
be
it
for
vengeance
?
"
ask
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
no
;
it
be
not
for
vengeance
,
Mr.
Bunce
declare
.
<EOS>
"
It
ought
not
to
be
,
"
continue
Mr.
Low
;
"
because
,
though
you
think
that
the
man
exceed
in
his
duty
,
you
must
feel
that
he
be
do
so
through
no
personal
ill
-
will
to
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
want
be
,
to
have
the
fellow
keep
in
their
proper
place
,
"
say
Mr.
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
exactly
;
 
and
therefore
these
thing
,
when
they
occur
,
be
mention
in
the
press
and
in
Parliament
,
 
and
<EOS>
the
attention
of
a
Secretary
of
State
be
call
to
them
.
<EOS>
thank
God
,
we
do
not
have
very
much
of
that
kind
of
thing
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
maybe
we
shall
have
more
if
we
do
not
look
to
it
,
"
say
Bunce
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
always
be
look
to
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
;
 
"
look
to
it
very
carefully
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
think
anything
be
to
be
do
in
that
way
by
indictment
against
a
single
man
,
whose
conduct
have
be
already
approve
by
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
if
you
want
notoriety
,
Mr.
Bunce
,
and
do
not
mind
what
you
pay
for
it
;
or
have
get
anybody
else
to
pay
for
it
;
then
indeed
 
"
  
"
there
be
not
nobody
to
pay
for
it
,
"
say
Bunce
,
wax
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
certainly
should
not
pay
for
it
myself
if
I
be
you
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
but
Bunce
be
not
to
be
counsel
out
of
his
intention
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
out
in
the
square
with
Phineas
he
express
great
anger
against
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
know
what
patriotism
mean
,
"
say
the
law
scrivener
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
talk
to
me
about
notoriety
!
<EOS>
It
have
always
be
the
same
way
with
'em
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
show
a
spark
of
public
feeling
,
it
be
all
hambition
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
no
notoriety
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
earn
my
bread
peaceable
,
and
to
be
let
alone
when
I
be
about
my
own
business
.
<EOS>
I
pay
rate
for
the
police
to
look
after
rogue
,
not
to
haul
folk
about
and
lock
'em
up
for
day
and
night
,
who
be
do
what
they
have
a
legal
right
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
after
that
,
Bunce
go
to
his
attorney
,
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
business
at
the
stationer
's
shop
,
and
Phineas
visit
the
office
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
.
<EOS>
there
he
write
a
lead
article
about
Bunce
's
case
,
for
which
he
be
in
due
time
to
be
pay
a
guinea
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
may
do
more
for
him
in
this
way
than
ever
would
be
do
by
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slide
,
however
,
and
another
gentleman
at
the
_
Banner
_
office
,
much
old
than
Mr.
Slide
,
who
announce
himself
as
the
actual
editor
,
be
anxious
that
Phineas
should
rid
himself
of
his
heterodox
political
resolution
about
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
they
care
much
about
his
own
opinion
;
and
when
Phineas
attempt
to
argue
with
the
editor
on
the
merit
of
the
ballot
,
the
editor
put
him
down
very
shortly
.
<EOS>
"
We
go
in
for
it
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Finn
would
go
in
for
it
too
,
the
editor
seem
to
think
that
Mr.
Finn
may
make
himself
very
useful
at
the
_
Banner
_
Office
.
<EOS>
Phineas
stoutly
maintain
that
this
be
impossible
,
 
and
be
therefore
drive
to
confine
his
article
in
the
service
of
the
people
to
those
open
subject
on
which
his
opinion
agree
with
those
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
second
article
,
and
the
editor
seem
to
think
that
,
backward
as
he
be
about
the
ballot
,
he
be
too
useful
an
aid
to
be
throw
aside
.
<EOS>
a
member
of
Parliament
be
not
now
all
that
he
be
once
,
but
still
there
be
a
prestige
in
the
letter
affix
to
his
name
which
make
him
loom
large
in
the
eye
of
the
world
than
other
man
.
<EOS>
get
into
Parliament
,
if
it
be
but
for
the
borough
of
Loughshane
,
and
the
_
People
's
Banners
<EOS>
_
all
round
will
be
glad
of
your
assistance
,
as
will
also
company
limited
and
unlimited
to
a
very
marvellous
extent
.
<EOS>
Phineas
write
his
article
and
promise
to
look
in
again
,
and
so
they
go
on
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
continue
to
assure
him
that
a
"
horgan
"
be
indispensable
to
him
,
and
Phineas
begin
to
accommodate
his
ear
to
the
sound
which
have
at
first
be
so
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
He
find
that
his
acquaintance
,
Mr.
Slide
,
have
idea
of
his
own
as
to
get
into
the
'
ouse
at
some
future
time
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
look
upon
the
'
ouse
as
my
oyster
,
and
'
ere
be
my
sword
,
"
say
Mr.
Slide
,
brandish
an
old
quill
pen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
feel
that
if
once
there
I
could
get
along
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
a
man
want
?
<EOS>
It
be
only
pluck
,
 
that
he
should
not
funk
because
a
"
undred
other
man
be
look
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
then
Phineas
ask
him
whether
he
have
any
idea
of
a
constituency
,
to
which
Mr.
Slide
reply
that
he
have
no
absolutely
form
intention
.
<EOS>
many
borough
,
however
,
would
doubtless
be
set
free
from
aristocratic
influence
by
the
redistribution
of
seat
which
must
take
place
,
as
Mr.
Slide
declare
,
at
any
rate
in
the
next
session
.
<EOS>
then
he
name
the
borough
of
Loughton
;
and
Phineas
Finn
,
thinking
of
Saulsby
,
thinking
of
the
Earl
,
thinking
of
Lady
Laura
,
and
thinking
of
Violet
,
walk
away
disgusted
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
well
that
the
quiet
town
,
cluster
close
round
the
wall
of
Saulsby
,
should
remain
as
it
be
,
than
that
it
should
be
pollute
by
the
presence
of
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
?
  
<EOS>
on
the
last
day
of
the
debate
,
at
a
few
moment
before
four
o'clock
,
Phineas
encounter
another
terrible
misfortune
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
at
the
pot
pea
since
twelve
,
and
have
on
this
occasion
targe
two
or
three
commissariat
officer
very
tightly
with
question
respect
cabbage
and
potato
,
and
have
ask
whether
the
officer
on
board
a
certain
ship
do
not
always
eat
preserve
asparagus
while
the
man
have
not
even
a
bean
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
he
have
be
put
up
to
this
business
by
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
,
and
that
he
make
himself
nasty
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
so
much
nastiness
of
the
kind
go
,
that
his
little
effort
make
no
great
difference
.
<EOS>
the
conservative
member
of
the
Committee
,
on
whose
side
of
the
House
the
inquiry
have
originate
,
do
not
scruple
to
lay
all
manner
of
charge
to
officer
whom
,
be
they
themselves
in
power
,
they
would
be
bind
to
support
and
would
support
with
all
their
energy
.
<EOS>
about
a
quarter
before
four
the
member
of
the
Committee
have
dismiss
their
last
witness
for
the
day
,
be
desirous
of
not
lose
their
chance
of
seat
on
so
important
an
occasion
,
and
hurry
down
into
the
lobby
,
 
so
that
they
may
enter
the
House
before
prayer
.
<EOS>
Phineas
here
be
button
-
hole
by
Barrington
Erle
,
who
say
something
to
him
as
to
the
approach
division
.
<EOS>
They
be
stand
in
front
of
the
door
of
the
House
,
almost
in
the
middle
of
the
lobby
,
with
a
crowd
of
member
around
them
,
 
on
a
spot
which
,
as
frequenter
know
,
be
hallowed
ground
,
and
must
not
be
trodden
by
stranger
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
act
of
answer
Erle
,
when
he
be
touch
on
the
arm
,
and
on
turn
round
,
see
Mr.
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
"
about
that
little
bill
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
say
the
horrible
man
,
turn
his
chin
round
over
his
white
cravat
.
<EOS>
"
They
always
tell
me
at
your
lodging
that
you
be
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
this
time
a
policeman
be
explain
to
Mr.
Clarkson
with
gentle
violence
that
he
must
not
stand
there
,
 
that
he
must
go
aside
into
one
of
the
corner
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
that
,
"
say
Mr.
Clarkson
,
retreat
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
do
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
a
man
to
do
when
a
gent
will
not
see
him
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
stand
aside
in
his
corner
quietly
,
give
the
policeman
no
occasion
for
further
action
against
him
;
but
in
retreat
he
speak
loud
,
and
there
be
a
lull
of
voice
around
,
and
twenty
member
at
least
have
hear
what
have
be
say
.
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
no
doubt
have
his
privilege
,
but
Mr.
Clarkson
be
determine
that
the
privilege
should
avail
him
as
little
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
hard
.
<EOS>
the
real
offender
,
the
Lord
of
the
Treasury
,
the
peer
's
son
,
with
a
thousand
a
year
pay
by
the
country
be
not
treat
with
this
cruel
persecution
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
in
truth
never
take
a
farthing
from
any
one
but
his
father
;
and
though
doubtless
he
owe
something
at
this
moment
,
he
have
no
creditor
of
his
own
that
be
even
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
as
the
world
go
he
be
a
clear
man
,
 
but
for
this
debt
of
his
friend
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
He
leave
Barrington
Erle
in
the
lobby
,
and
hurry
into
the
House
,
blush
up
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
He
look
for
Fitzgibbon
in
his
place
,
but
the
Lord
of
the
Treasury
be
not
as
yet
there
.
<EOS>
doubtless
he
would
be
there
for
the
division
,
and
Phineas
resolve
that
he
would
speak
a
bit
of
his
mind
before
he
let
his
friend
out
of
his
sight
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
great
speech
make
on
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
deliver
an
oration
of
which
man
say
that
it
would
be
know
in
England
as
long
as
there
be
any
word
remain
of
english
eloquence
.
<EOS>
in
it
he
taunt
Mr.
Turnbull
with
be
a
recreant
to
the
people
,
of
whom
he
call
himself
so
often
the
champion
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Turnbull
be
not
in
the
least
moved
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
know
well
enough
that
Mr.
Turnbull
be
not
to
be
move
by
any
word
;
 
but
the
word
be
not
the
less
telling
to
the
House
and
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
man
,
who
hear
it
,
say
that
Mr.
Gresham
forget
himself
in
that
speech
,
forget
his
party
,
forget
his
strategy
,
forget
his
long
-
draw
scheme
,
 
even
his
love
of
applause
,
and
think
only
of
his
cause
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
reply
to
him
with
equal
genius
,
and
with
equal
skill
,
 
if
not
with
equal
heart
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
have
ask
for
the
approbation
of
all
present
and
of
all
future
reformer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
deny
him
both
,
 
the
one
because
he
would
not
succeed
,
and
the
other
because
he
would
not
have
deserved
success
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Mildmay
make
his
reply
,
get
up
at
about
three
o'clock
,
and
utter
a
prayer
,
 
a
futile
prayer
,
 
that
this
his
last
work
on
behalf
of
his
countryman
may
be
successful
.
<EOS>
His
bill
be
read
a
second
time
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
in
obedience
to
the
cast
vote
of
the
Speaker
,
 
but
a
majority
such
as
that
be
tantamount
to
a
defeat
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
of
course
,
on
that
night
no
declaration
as
to
what
minister
would
do
.
<EOS>
without
a
meeting
of
the
Cabinet
,
and
without
some
further
consideration
,
though
each
may
know
that
the
bill
would
be
withdraw
,
they
could
not
say
in
what
way
they
would
act
.
<EOS>
but
late
as
be
the
hour
,
there
be
many
word
on
the
subject
before
member
be
in
their
bed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
and
Mr.
Monk
leave
the
House
together
,
and
perhaps
no
two
gentleman
in
it
have
in
former
session
be
more
in
the
habit
of
walk
home
arm
-
in
-
arm
and
discuss
what
each
have
hear
and
what
each
have
say
in
that
assembly
.
<EOS>
latterly
these
two
man
have
go
strangely
asunder
in
their
path
,
 
very
strangely
for
man
who
have
for
year
walk
so
closely
together
.
<EOS>
and
this
separation
have
be
mark
by
violent
word
speak
against
each
other
,
 
by
violent
word
,
at
least
,
speak
against
him
in
office
by
the
one
who
have
never
contaminate
his
hand
by
the
Queen
's
shilling
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
,
they
be
able
to
walk
away
from
the
House
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
and
do
not
fly
at
each
other
's
throat
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
singular
enough
,
be
it
not
,
"
say
Mr.
Turnbull
,
"
that
the
thing
should
have
be
so
close
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
odd
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
;
"
but
man
have
say
that
it
would
be
so
all
the
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gresham
be
very
fine
,
"
say
Mr.
Turnbull
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
fine
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
never
have
hear
anything
like
it
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Daubeny
be
very
powerful
too
,
"
say
Mr.
Turnbull
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
the
occasion
be
great
,
and
he
answer
to
the
spur
.
<EOS>
but
Gresham
's
be
the
speech
of
the
debate
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
well
;
 
yes
;
perhaps
it
be
,
"
say
Mr.
Turnbull
,
who
be
think
of
his
own
flight
the
other
night
,
and
who
among
his
special
friend
have
be
much
praise
for
what
he
have
then
do
.
<EOS>
but
of
course
he
make
no
allusion
to
his
own
doing
,
 
or
to
those
of
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
they
converse
for
some
twenty
minute
,
till
they
part
;
but
neither
of
them
interrogate
the
other
as
to
what
either
may
be
call
upon
to
do
in
consequence
of
the
division
which
have
just
be
effect
.
<EOS>
They
may
still
be
intimate
friend
,
but
the
day
of
confidence
between
them
be
pass
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
have
see
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
enter
the
House
,
 
which
he
do
quite
late
in
the
night
,
so
as
to
be
in
time
for
the
division
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
have
dine
in
the
House
,
and
have
be
all
the
evening
in
the
library
,
 
or
in
the
smoking
-
room
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Mildmay
be
on
his
leg
make
his
reply
,
Fitzgibbon
have
saunter
in
,
not
choose
to
wait
till
he
may
be
ring
up
by
the
bell
at
the
last
moment
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
near
him
as
they
pass
by
the
teller
,
near
him
in
the
lobby
,
and
near
him
again
as
they
all
pass
back
into
the
House
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
last
moment
he
think
that
he
would
miss
his
prey
.
<EOS>
in
the
crowd
as
they
leave
the
House
he
fail
to
get
his
hand
upon
his
friend
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
but
he
hurry
down
the
member
'
passage
,
and
just
at
the
gate
lead
out
into
Westminster
Hall
he
overtake
Fitzgibbon
walk
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Barrington
Erle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Laurence
,
"
he
say
,
take
hold
of
his
countryman
's
arm
with
a
decide
grasp
,
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
speak
away
,
"
say
Laurence
.
<EOS>
then
Phineas
,
look
up
into
his
face
,
know
very
well
that
he
have
be
 
what
the
world
call
,
dining
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
remember
at
the
moment
that
Barrington
Erle
have
be
close
to
him
when
the
odious
money
-
lender
have
touch
his
arm
and
make
his
inquiry
about
that
"
little
bill
.
"
<EOS>
He
much
wish
to
make
Erle
understand
that
the
debt
be
not
his
own
,
 
that
he
be
not
in
the
hand
of
usurer
in
reference
to
his
own
concern
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
feeling
within
him
that
he
still
,
 
even
still
,
 
owe
something
to
his
friendship
to
Fitzgibbon
.
"
<EOS>
just
give
me
your
arm
,
and
come
on
with
me
for
a
minute
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
Erle
will
excuse
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
blaze
!
<EOS>
"
say
Laurence
,
"
what
be
it
<EOS>
you
be
after
?
<EOS>
I
be
not
good
at
private
conference
at
three
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
out
,
and
be
not
that
enough
for
ye
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
dreadfully
annoy
to
-
night
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
and
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bedad
,
Finn
,
my
boy
,
and
there
be
a
good
many
of
us
<EOS>
be
annoy
;
 
eh
,
Barrington
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
perceive
clearly
that
though
Fitzgibbon
have
be
dine
,
there
be
as
much
of
cunne
in
all
this
as
of
wine
,
and
he
be
determine
not
to
submit
to
such
unlimited
ill
-
usage
.
<EOS>
"
My
annoyance
come
from
your
friend
,
Mr.
Clarkson
,
who
have
the
impudence
to
address
me
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
serve
you
right
,
too
,
Finn
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
why
the
devil
do
you
sport
your
oak
to
him
?
<EOS>
He
have
tell
me
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
such
a
patient
little
fellow
as
Clarkson
anywhere
,
if
you
will
only
let
him
have
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
He
will
look
in
,
as
he
call
it
,
three
time
a
week
for
a
whole
season
,
and
do
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
do
not
like
to
be
lock
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
the
gentleman
with
whom
the
police
interfere
in
the
lobby
?
"
<EOS>
Erle
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
confound
bill
discounter
to
whom
our
friend
here
have
introduce
me
,
 
for
his
own
purpose
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
gentleman

<EOS>
after
this
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
and
Barrington
Erle
get
into
a
cab
together
,
and
be
drive
away
.
   
<EOS>
a
Cabinet
Meeting
 
<EOS>
and
now
will
the
Muses
assist
me
while
I
sing
an
altogether
new
song
?
<EOS>
on
the
Tuesday
the
Cabinet
meet
at
the
First
Lord
's
official
residence
in
Downing
Street
,
and
I
will
attempt
to
describe
what
,
accord
to
the
bewilder
brain
of
a
poor
fictionist
,
be
say
or
may
have
be
say
,
what
be
do
or
may
have
be
do
,
on
so
august
an
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
fictionist
very
frequently
find
himself
to
have
be
wrong
in
his
description
of
thing
in
general
,
and
be
tell
so
,
roughly
by
the
critic
,
and
tenderly
by
the
friend
of
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
He
be
move
to
tell
of
thing
of
which
he
omit
to
learn
the
nature
before
he
tell
of
them
 
as
should
be
do
by
a
strictly
honest
fictionist
.
<EOS>
He
catch
salmon
in
October
;
or
shoot
his
partridge
in
March
.
<EOS>
His
dahlias
bloom
in
June
,
and
his
bird
sing
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
He
open
the
opera
-
house
before
Easter
,
and
make
Parliament
sit
on
a
Wednesday
evening
.
<EOS>
and
then
those
terrible
mesh
of
the
Law
!
<EOS>
how
be
a
fictionist
,
in
these
excited
day
,
to
create
the
need
biting
interest
without
legal
difficulty
;
and
how
again
be
he
to
steer
his
little
bark
clear
of
so
many
rock
,
 
when
the
rock
and
the
shoal
have
be
purposely
arrange
to
make
the
taking
of
a
pilot
on
board
a
necessity
?
<EOS>
as
to
those
law
mesh
,
a
benevolent
pilot
will
,
indeed
,
now
and
again
give
a
poor
fictionist
a
help
hand
,
 
not
use
,
however
,
generally
,
with
much
discretion
.
<EOS>
but
from
whom
be
any
assistance
to
come
in
the
august
matter
of
a
Cabinet
assembly
?
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
such
assistance
.
<EOS>
no
man
can
tell
aught
but
they
who
will
tell
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
again
,
there
be
this
safety
<EOS>
,
that
let
the
story
be
ever
so
mistold
,
 
let
the
fiction
be
ever
so
far
remove
from
the
truth
,
no
critic
short
of
a
Cabinet
Minister
himself
can
convict
the
narrator
of
error
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
dingy
room
,
cover
with
a
Turkey
carpet
,
and
contain
a
dark
polished
mahogany
dinner
-
table
,
on
very
heavy
carve
leg
,
which
an
old
messenger
be
prepare
at
two
o'clock
in
the
day
for
the
use
of
her
Majesty
's
Ministers
.
<EOS>
the
table
would
have
be
large
enough
for
fourteen
guest
,
and
along
the
side
further
from
the
fire
,
there
be
place
some
six
heavy
chair
,
good
comfortable
chair
,
stuff
at
the
back
as
well
as
the
seat
,
 
but
on
the
side
nearer
to
the
fire
the
chair
be
place
irregularly
;
and
there
be
four
armchair
,
 
two
on
one
side
and
two
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
there
be
four
window
to
the
room
,
which
look
on
to
St.
James
's
Park
,
and
the
curtain
of
the
window
be
dark
and
heavy
,
 
as
become
the
gravity
of
the
purpose
to
which
that
chamber
be
appropriate
.
<EOS>
in
old
day
it
have
be
the
dining
-
room
of
one
Prime
Minister
after
another
.
<EOS>
to
Pitt
it
have
be
the
abode
of
his
own
familiar
prandial
Penates
,
and
Lord
Liverpool
have
be
dull
there
among
his
dull
friend
for
long
year
after
year
.
<EOS>
the
Ministers
of
the
present
day
find
it
more
convenient
to
live
in
private
home
,
and
,
indeed
,
not
unfrequently
carry
their
cabinet
with
them
.
<EOS>
but
,
under
Mr.
Mildmay
's
rule
,
the
meeting
be
generally
hold
in
the
old
room
at
the
official
residence
.
<EOS>
Thrice
do
the
aged
messenger
move
each
armchair
,
now
a
little
this
way
<EOS>
and
now
a
little
that
,
and
then
look
at
them
as
though
something
of
the
tendency
of
the
come
meeting
may
depend
on
the
comfort
of
its
lead
member
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Mildmay
should
find
himself
to
be
quite
comfortable
,
so
that
he
could
hear
what
be
say
without
a
struggle
to
his
ear
,
and
see
his
colleague
'
face
clearly
,
and
feel
the
fire
without
burn
his
shin
,
it
may
be
possible
that
he
would
not
insist
upon
resign
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
so
,
how
important
be
the
work
now
confide
to
the
hand
of
that
aged
messenger
!
<EOS>
when
his
anxious
eye
have
glance
round
the
room
<EOS>
some
half
a
dozen
time
,
when
he
have
touch
each
curtain
,
lay
his
hand
upon
every
chair
,
and
dust
certain
paper
which
lie
upon
a
side
-
table
,
 
and
which
have
be
lie
there
for
two
year
,
and
at
which
no
one
ever
look
or
would
look
,
 
he
gently
creep
away
and
ensconce
himself
in
an
easy
chair
not
far
from
the
door
of
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
for
it
may
be
necessary
to
stop
the
attempt
of
a
rash
intruder
on
those
secret
counsel
.
  
<EOS>
very
shortly
there
be
hear
the
ring
of
various
voice
in
the
passage
,
 
the
voice
of
man
speak
pleasantly
,
the
voice
of
man
with
whom
it
seem
,
from
their
tone
,
that
thing
be
do
well
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
and
then
a
cluster
of
four
or
five
gentleman
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
at
first
sight
they
seem
to
be
as
ordinary
gentleman
as
you
shall
meet
anywhere
about
Pall
Mall
on
an
afternoon
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
about
their
outward
appearance
of
the
august
wiggery
of
statecraft
,
nothing
of
the
ponderous
dignity
of
ministerial
position
.
<EOS>
that
little
man
in
the
square
-
cut
coat
,
 
<EOS>
we
may
almost
call
it
a
shooting
-
coat
,
 
swinge
an
umbrella
and
wear
no
glove
,
be
no
less
a
person
than
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
 
Lord
Weazeling
,
 
who
make
a
hundred
thousand
pound
as
Attorney
-
General
,
and
be
suppose
to
be
the
good
lawyer
of
his
age
.
<EOS>
He
be
fifty
,
but
he
look
to
be
hardly
over
forty
,
and
one
may
take
him
to
be
,
from
his
appearance
,
 
perhaps
a
clerk
in
the
War
Office
,
well
-
to
-
do
,
and
popular
among
his
brother
-
clerk
.
<EOS>
immediately
with
him
be
Sir
Harry
Coldfoot
,
also
a
lawyer
by
profession
,
though
he
have
never
practise
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
the
House
for
nearly
thirty
year
,
and
be
now
at
the
Home
Office
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
stout
,
healthy
,
grey
-
haired
gentleman
,
who
certainly
do
not
wear
the
care
of
office
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
however
,
no
minister
get
more
bully
than
he
by
the
press
,
and
man
say
that
he
will
be
very
willing
to
give
up
to
some
political
enemy
the
control
of
the
police
,
and
the
onerous
duty
of
judge
in
all
criminal
appeal
.
<EOS>
behind
these
come
our
friend
Mr.
Monk
,
young
Lord
Cantrip
from
the
colony
next
door
,
than
whom
no
smart
young
peer
now
do
honour
to
our
hereditary
legislature
,
and
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
,
the
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
of
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
why
Sir
Marmaduke
have
always
be
place
in
Mr.
Mildmay
's
cabinet
nobody
ever
know
.
<EOS>
as
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
he
have
nothing
to
do
,
 
and
be
there
anything
,
he
would
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
rarely
speak
in
the
House
,
and
then
do
not
speak
well
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
handsome
man
,
or
would
be
but
for
an
assumption
of
grandeur
in
the
carriage
of
his
eye
,
give
to
his
face
a
character
of
pomposity
which
he
himself
well
deserve
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
Guards
when
young
,
and
have
be
in
Parliament
since
he
cease
to
be
young
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
suppose
that
Mr.
Mildmay
have
find
something
in
him
,
for
he
have
be
include
in
three
successive
liberal
Cabinets
.
<EOS>
He
have
probably
the
virtue
of
be
true
to
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
of
be
duly
submissive
to
one
whom
he
recognise
as
his
superior
.
  
<EOS>
within
two
minute
afterwards
the
Duke
follow
,
with
Plantagenet
Palliser
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
,
as
all
the
world
know
,
be
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
the
very
front
and
head
of
the
aristocratic
old
Whigs
of
the
country
,
 
a
man
who
have
be
thrice
speak
of
as
Prime
Minister
,
and
who
really
may
have
fill
the
office
have
he
not
know
himself
to
be
unfit
for
it
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
have
be
consult
as
to
the
making
of
Cabinets
for
the
last
five
-
and
-
thirty
year
,
and
be
even
now
not
an
old
man
in
appearance
;
 
a
fussy
,
popular
,
clever
,
conscientious
man
,
whose
digestion
have
be
too
good
to
make
politic
a
burden
to
him
,
but
who
have
think
seriously
about
his
country
,
and
be
one
who
will
be
sure
to
leave
memoir
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
bear
in
the
semi
-
purple
of
ministerial
influence
,
and
man
say
of
him
that
he
be
honest
than
his
uncle
,
who
be
Canning
's
friend
,
but
not
so
great
a
man
as
his
grandfather
,
with
whom
Fox
once
quarrel
,
and
whom
Burke
love
.
<EOS>
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
himself
the
heir
to
a
dukedom
,
be
the
young
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
of
whom
some
statesman
think
much
as
the
rise
star
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
if
industry
,
rectitude
of
purpose
,
and
a
certain
clearness
of
intellect
may
prevail
,
Planty
Pall
,
as
he
be
familiarly
call
,
may
become
a
great
Minister
.
  
<EOS>
then
come
Viscount
Thrift
by
himself
;
 
the
First
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
,
with
the
whole
weight
of
a
new
iron
-
clothe
fleet
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
have
undertake
the
herculean
task
of
cleanse
the
dockyard
,
 
and
with
it
the
less
work
of
keep
afloat
a
navy
that
may
be
esteem
by
his
countryman
to
be
the
good
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
and
he
think
that
he
will
do
both
,
if
only
Mr.
Mildmay
will
not
resign
;
 
an
industrious
,
honest
,
self
-
deny
nobleman
,
who
work
without
cease
from
morn
to
night
,
and
who
hope
to
rise
in
time
to
high
thing
,
 
to
the
translating
of
Homer
,
perhaps
,
and
the
wear
of
the
Garter
.
  
<EOS>
close
behind
him
<EOS>
there
be
a
ruck
of
Ministers
,
with
the
much
-
honoured
grey
-
haired
old
Premier
in
the
midst
of
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
Mr.
Gresham
,
the
Foreign
Minister
,
<EOS>
say
to
be
the
great
orator
in
Europe
,
on
whose
shoulder
it
be
think
that
the
mantle
of
Mr.
Mildmay
would
fall
,
 
to
be
wear
<EOS>
,
however
,
quite
otherwise
than
Mr.
Mildmay
have
wear
it
.
<EOS>
for
Mr.
Gresham
be
a
man
with
no
feeling
for
the
past
,
void
of
historical
association
,
hardly
with
memory
,
 
live
altogether
for
the
future
which
he
be
anxious
to
fashion
anew
out
of
the
vigour
of
his
own
brain
.
<EOS>
whereas
,
with
Mr.
Mildmay
,
even
his
love
of
reform
be
an
inherit
passion
for
an
old
-
world
liberalism
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
with
them
<EOS>
Mr.
Legge
Wilson
,
the
brother
of
a
peer
,
Secretary
at
War
,
a
great
scholar
and
a
polished
gentleman
,
very
proud
of
his
position
as
a
Cabinet
Minister
,
but
conscious
that
he
have
hardly
earn
it
by
political
work
.
<EOS>
and
Lord
Plinlimmon
be
with
them
,
the
Comptroller
of
India
,
 
of
all
work
lord
the
most
jaunty
,
the
most
pleasant
,
and
the
most
popular
,
very
good
at
take
chair
at
dinner
,
and
make
become
speech
at
the
short
notice
,
a
man
apparently
very
free
and
open
in
his
way
of
life
,
 
but
cautious
enough
in
truth
as
to
every
step
,
know
well
how
hard
it
be
to
climb
and
how
easy
to
fall
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
enter
the
room
lean
on
Lord
Plinlimmon
's
arm
,
and
when
he
make
his
way
up
among
the
armchair
upon
the
rug
before
the
fire
,
the
other
cluster
around
him
with
cheer
look
and
kindly
question
.
<EOS>
then
come
the
Privy
Seal
,
our
old
friend
Lord
Brentford
,
last
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
would
say
least
,
but
that
the
word
of
no
councillor
could
go
for
less
in
such
an
assemblage
than
will
those
of
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
,
the
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
of
Lancaster
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
be
soon
seat
in
one
of
the
armchair
,
while
Lord
Plinlimmon
lean
against
the
table
close
at
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
stand
upright
at
the
corner
of
the
chimney
-
piece
furth
from
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
at
that
near
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
take
the
armchair
close
at
Mr.
Mildmay
's
left
hand
.
<EOS>
Lord
Plinlimmon
be
,
as
I
have
say
,
lean
against
the
table
,
but
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
who
be
next
to
him
,
sit
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Viscount
Thrift
and
Mr.
Monk
occupy
chair
on
the
further
side
of
the
table
,
near
to
Mr.
Mildmay
's
end
,
and
Mr.
Legge
Wilson
place
himself
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
thus
join
them
as
it
be
into
a
body
.
<EOS>
the
Home
Secretary
stand
before
the
Lord
Chancellor
screen
him
from
the
fire
,
and
the
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
,
after
wait
for
a
few
minute
as
though
in
doubt
,
take
one
of
the
vacant
armchair
.
<EOS>
the
young
lord
from
the
Colonies
stand
a
little
behind
the
shoulder
of
his
great
friend
from
the
Foreign
Office
;
and
the
Privy
Seal
,
after
move
about
for
a
while
uneasily
,
take
a
chair
behind
the
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
.
<EOS>
one
armchair
be
thus
leave
vacant
,
but
there
be
no
other
comer
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
so
bad
as
I
think
it
would
be
,
"
say
the
Duke
,
speak
aloud
,
but
nevertheless
address
himself
specially
to
his
chief
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
bad
enough
,
"
say
Mr.
Mildmay
,
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
bad
enough
indeed
,
"
say
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
,
without
any
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
such
a
good
bill
lose
,
"
say
Lord
Plinlimmon
.
<EOS>
"
the
bad
of
these
failure
be
,
that
the
same
identical
bill
can
never
be
bring
in
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
that
if
the
lose
bill
be
good
,
the
bill
that
will
not
be
lose
can
only
be
second
good
,
"
say
the
Lord
Chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
do
think
that
after
the
debate
before
Easter
we
should
not
have
come
to
shipwreck
about
the
ballot
,
"
say
Mr.
Mildmay
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
brew
for
us
all
along
,
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
,
who
then
with
a
gesture
of
his
hand
and
a
pressure
of
his
lip
withhold
word
which
he
be
nearly
uttering
,
and
which
would
not
,
probably
,
have
be
complimentary
to
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
he
turn
half
round
and
say
something
to
Lord
Cantrip
which
be
not
audible
to
any
one
else
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
worthy
of
note
,
however
,
that
Mr.
Turnbull
's
name
be
not
once
mention
aloud
at
that
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
be
brew
all
along
,
"
say
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
gentleman
,
we
must
take
it
as
we
get
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Mildmay
,
still
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
now
we
must
consider
what
we
shall
do
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
pause
as
though
expect
that
counsel
would
come
to
him
first
from
one
colleague
and
then
from
another
.
<EOS>
but
no
such
counsel
come
,
and
probably
Mr.
Mildmay
do
not
in
the
least
expect
that
it
would
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
not
stay
where
we
be
,
of
course
,
"
say
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
be
privileged
to
say
as
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
but
though
every
man
in
the
room
know
that
it
must
be
so
,
no
one
but
the
Duke
would
have
say
it
,
before
Mr.
Mildmay
have
speak
plainly
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Mr.
Mildmay
;
"
I
suppose
that
we
can
hardly
stay
where
we
be
.
<EOS>
probably
none
of
us
wish
it
,
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
look
round
upon
his
colleague
,
and
there
come
a
sort
of
an
assent
,
though
there
be
no
spoken
word
.
<EOS>
the
sound
from
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
be
loud
than
that
from
the
other
;
 
but
yet
from
him
it
be
no
more
than
an
attesting
grunt
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
two
thing
to
consider
,
"
continue
Mr.
Mildmay
,
 
and
though
he
speak
in
a
very
low
voice
,
every
word
be
hear
by
all
present
,
 
"
two
thing
chiefly
,
that
is
;
the
work
of
the
country
and
the
Queen
's
comfort
.
<EOS>
I
propose
to
see
her
Majesty
this
afternoon
at
five
,
 
that
is
,
in
something
less
than
two
hour
'
time
,
and
I
hope
to
be
able
to
tell
the
House
by
seven
what
have
take
place
between
her
Majesty
and
me
.
<EOS>
My
friend
,
his
grace
,
will
do
as
much
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
if
you
agree
with
me
,
gentleman
,
I
will
explain
to
the
Queen
that
it
be
not
for
the
welfare
of
the
country
that
we
should
retain
our
place
,
and
I
will
place
your
resignation
and
my
own
in
her
Majesty
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
advise
her
Majesty
to
send
for
Lord
de
Terrier
,
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
;
 
there
will
be
no
other
course
open
to
me
.
"
  
"
or
to
her
,
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
to
this
remark
from
the
rise
Minister
of
the
day
,
no
word
of
reply
be
make
;
but
of
those
present
in
the
room
three
or
four
of
the
most
experienced
servant
of
the
Crown
feel
that
Mr.
Gresham
have
be
imprudent
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
,
who
have
.
<EOS>
ever
be
afraid
of
Mr.
Gresham
,
tell
Mr.
Palliser
afterwards
that
such
an
observation
should
not
have
be
make
;
and
Sir
Harry
Coldfoot
ponder
upon
it
uneasily
,
and
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
ask
Mr.
Mildmay
what
he
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
time
change
so
much
,
and
with
the
time
the
feeling
of
man
,
"
say
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
whether
Sir
Marmaduke
quite
understand
him
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
silence
in
the
room
for
a
moment
or
two
after
Mr.
Gresham
have
speak
,
and
then
Mr.
Mildmay
again
address
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
may
be
possible
that
my
Lord
de
Terrier
may
foresee
difficulty
,
or
may
find
difficulty
which
will
oblige
him
,
either
at
once
,
or
after
an
attempt
have
be
make
,
to
decline
the
task
which
her
Majesty
will
probably
commit
to
him
.
<EOS>
all
of
us
,
no
doubt
,
know
that
the
arrangement
of
a
government
be
not
the
most
easy
task
in
the
world
;
and
that
it
be
not
make
the
more
easy
by
an
absence
of
a
majority
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
would
dissolve
,
I
presume
,
"
say
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
so
,
"
continue
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
may
not
improbably
come
to
pass
that
her
Majesty
will
feel
herself
oblige
to
send
again
for
some
one
or
two
of
us
,
that
we
may
tender
to
her
Majesty
the
advice
which
we
owe
to
her
;
 
for
me
,
for
instance
,
or
for
my
friend
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
in
such
a
matter
she
would
be
much
guide
probably
by
what
Lord
de
Terrier
may
have
suggest
to
her
.
<EOS>
Should
this
be
so
,
and
should
I
be
consult
,
my
present
feeling
be
that
we
should
resume
our
office
so
that
the
necessary
business
of
the
session
should
be
complete
,
and
that
we
should
then
dissolve
Parliament
,
and
thus
ascertain
the
opinion
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
in
such
case
,
however
,
we
should
of
course
meet
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
think
that
the
course
propose
by
Mr.
Mildmay
will
be
the
good
,
"
say
the
Duke
,
who
have
no
doubt
already
discuss
the
matter
with
his
friend
the
Prime
Minister
in
private
.
<EOS>
no
one
else
say
a
word
either
of
argument
or
disagreement
,
and
the
Cabinet
Council
be
break
up
.
<EOS>
the
old
messenger
,
who
have
be
asleep
in
his
chair
,
stand
up
and
bow
as
the
Ministers
walk
by
him
,
and
then
go
in
and
rearrange
the
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
as
much
idea
of
give
up
as
you
or
I
have
,
"
say
Lord
Cantrip
to
his
friend
Mr.
Gresham
,
as
they
walk
arm
-
in
-
arm
together
from
the
Treasury
Chambers
across
St.
James
's
Park
towards
the
club
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
sure
that
he
be
not
right
,
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
for
himself
or
for
the
country
?
"
ask
Lord
Cantrip
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
his
future
fame
.
<EOS>
They
who
have
abdicate
and
have
cling
to
their
abdication
have
always
lose
by
it
.
<EOS>
Cincinnatus
be
bring
back
again
,
and
Charles
V.
be
feel
to
have
be
foolish
.
<EOS>
the
peach
of
retire
minister
of
which
we
hear
so
often
have
generally
be
cultivate
in
a
constrained
seclusion
;
 
or
at
least
the
world
so
believe
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
talk
probably
of
Mr.
Mildmay
,
as
to
whom
some
of
his
colleague
have
think
it
probable
,
know
that
he
would
now
resign
,
that
he
would
have
to
-
day
declare
his
intention
of
lay
aside
for
ever
the
care
of
office
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
walk
home
alone
,
and
as
he
go
there
be
something
of
a
feeling
of
disappointment
at
heart
,
which
make
him
ask
himself
whether
Mr.
Turnbull
may
not
have
be
right
in
rebuke
him
for
join
the
Government
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
I
think
,
be
in
no
way
due
to
Mr.
Mildmay
's
resignation
,
but
rather
to
a
conviction
on
Mr.
Monk
's
part
that
that
he
have
contribute
but
little
to
his
country
's
welfare
by
sit
in
Mr.
Mildmay
's
Cabinet

<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
's
Luck
 
<EOS>
after
the
holding
of
that
Cabinet
Council
of
which
the
author
have
dare
to
attempt
a
slight
sketch
in
the
last
chapter

there
be
various
visit
make

afterwards
by

again
by
Lord

various
explanation
make

Parliament

each
House

rival
be
very
courteous
to

promising
assistance

at
the
end

it
the

the

change
make
be
effect
by
the
retirement
of
Sir

Morecombe
,
who
be
raise
to

peerage
,
and
by
the
selection
of
 
Mr.
Kennedy
to
fill
his
place
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
during
the
late
debate
have
make
one
of
those
speech
,
few
and
far
between
,
by
which
he
have
create
for
himself
a
parliamentary
reputation
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
all
man
express
their
great
surprise
,
and
no
one
could
quite
understand
why
Mr.
Kennedy
have
be
make
a
Cabinet
Minister
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to

His

I
do
not

It

<EOS>
there

my

be

He
tell
me
that
it

be
unbecoming
in
him
to
refuse
,
and
that
be
all
he
say
to
me
about
it

"
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
hold
their
seat
,
but
they
do
so
as
it
be
only
upon
further
trial
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
take
the
course
which
he
have
indicate
to
his
colleague
at
the
Cabinet
meeting
.
<EOS>
before
all
the
explanation
and
journeying
be
complete
,
April
be
over
,
and
the
much
-
need
Whitsuntide
holiday
be
come
on
.
<EOS>
but
little
of
the
routine
work
of
the
session
have
be
do
;
and
,
as
Mr.
Mildmay
tell
the
House
more
than
once
,
the
country
would
suffer
be
the
Queen
to
dissolve
Parliament
at
this
period
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
the
old
Ministers
would
go
on
with
the
business
of
the
country
,
Lord
de
Terrier
with
his
follower
have
decline
to
take
affair
into
their
hand
;
and
at
the
close
of
the
session
,
which
should
be
make
as
short
as
possible
,
writ
should
be
issue
for
new
election
.
<EOS>
this
be
Mr.
Mildmay
's
programme
,
and
it
be
one
of
which
no
one
dare
to
complain
very
loudly
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
,
indeed
,
do
speak
a
word
of
caution
.
<EOS>
He
tell
Mr.
Mildmay
that
he
have
lose
his
bill
,
good
in
other
respect
,
because
he
have
refuse
to
introduce
the
ballot
into
his
measure
.
<EOS>
let
him
promise
to
be
wise
for
the
future
,
and
to
obey
the
manifest
wish
of
the
country
,
and
then
all
would
be
well
with
him
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
,
Mr.
Mildmay
declare
that
to
the
good
of
his
power
of
read
the
country
,
his
countryman
have
manifest
no
such
wish
;
and
that
if
they
do
so
,
if
by
the
fresh
election
it
should
be
show
that
the
ballot
be
in
truth
desire
,
he
would
at
once
leave
the
execution
of
their
wish
to
abler
and
young
hand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
express
himself
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
Minister
's
answer
,
and
say
that
the
come
election
would
show
whether
he
or
Mr.
Mildmay
be
right
.
  
<EOS>
many
man
,
and
among
them
some
of
his
colleague
,
think
that
Mr.
Mildmay
have
be
imprudent
.
"
<EOS>
no
man
ought
ever
to
pledge
himself
to
anything
,
"
say
Sir
Harry
Coldfoot
to
the
Duke
;
 
"
<EOS>
that
is
,
to
anything
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Duke
,
who
be
very
true
to
Mr.
Mildmay
,
make
no
reply
to
this
,
but
even
he
think
that
his
old
friend
have
be
betray
into
a
promise
too
rapidly
.
<EOS>
but
the
pledge
be
give
,
and
some
people
already
begin
to
make
much
of
it
.
<EOS>
there
appear
leader
after
leader
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
urge
the
constituency
to
take
advantage
of
the
Prime
Minister
's
word
,
and
to
show
clearly
at
the
hustings
that
they
desire
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
come
over
to
us
,
Mr.
Finn
;
you
have
indeed
,
"
say
Mr.
Slide

<EOS>
"
now
be
the
time
to
do
it
,
and
show
yourself
a
people

friend

<EOS>
You
will
have
to
do
it
sooner

later

whether
or
no

come
to
us

we
will
be
your

<EOS>
but
in
those
day
Phineas
be
something
less
in
love
with
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
than
he
have
be
at
the
time
of
the
great
debate
,
for
he
be
become
more

more
closely
connected
with
people
who
in
their
way
of
living
and
mode
of
expression
be
very
unlike
Mr.

<EOS>
this
advice
be
give

him
about
the
end

at
that

Mrs.
Bunce
have
reply

I
shall
not

when

well

and
although
he
say
that
the
room
be
at
his
son
's
disposal
should
Lord
Chiltern
choose
to
come
to
London
,
still
he
say
it
in
such
a
way
that
Phineas
,
who
go
down
to
Willingford
,
could
not
tell
his
friend
that
he
would
be
make
welcome
in
Portman
Square

<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
leave

Lord

to
him
.
"
<EOS>
My

me
by
everything
he
say
and
do
,
and
I
annoy
him
by
say
and
do
nothing

"
<EOS>
then
there
come
an
invitation
to
him
from
Lady
Laura
and
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
Would
he
come
to
Grosvenor
Place
?
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
press
this
very
much
,
though
in
truth
Mr.
Kennedy
have
hardly
do
more
than
give
a
cold
assent
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
Chiltern
would
not
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
some
reason
for
my
go
to
my
father
's
house
,
"
say
he
,
"
though
he
and
I
be
not
the
good
friend
in
the
world
;
but
there
can
be
no
reason
for
my
go
to
the
house
of
a
man
I
dislike
so
much
as
I
do
Robert
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
the
matter
be
settle
in
the
manner
tell
above
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pouncefoot

room
be
prepare
for
him
at
Mr.
Bunce
's
house
,
and
Phineas
Finn
go
down
to
Willingford
and
bring
him
up
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
sell
Bonebreaker
,
"
he
say
,
 
"
to
a
young
fellow
whose
neck
will
certainly
be
the
sacrifice
if
he
attempt
to
ride
him
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
give
him
to
you
,
Phineas
,
only
you
would
not
have
know
what
to
do
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
when
he
come
up
to
London
be
still
in
bandage
,
though
,
as
the
surgeon
say
,
his
bone
seem
to
have
be
make
to
be
break
and
set
again
;
and
his
bandage
of
course
be
a
sufficient
excuse
for
his
visit
the
house
neither
of
his
father
nor
his
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Laura
go
to
him
frequently
,
and
thus
become
acquainted
with
our
hero
's
home
and
with
Mrs.
Bunce
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
message
take
from
Violet
to
the
man
in
bandage
<EOS>
,
some
of
which
lose
nothing
in
the
carrying
.
<EOS>
once
Lady
Laura
try
to
make
Violet
think
that
it
would
be
right
,
or
rather
not
wrong
,
that
they
two
should
go
together
to
Lord
Chiltern
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
would
you
have
me
tell
my
aunt
,
or
would
you
have
me
not
tell
her
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Violet
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
you
do
just
as
you
please
,
"
Lady
Laura
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
shall
,
"
Violet
reply
,
"
but
I
will
do
nothing
that
I
should
be
ashamed
to
tell
any
one

Your

to
be
in

<EOS>
"
He
be
in

Lady

.
<EOS>
"
even
you
do
not
pretend
to
doubt
his
faith

"
  
"
<EOS>
very
well
.
<EOS>
in
those
circumstance
a
girl
should
not
go
to
a
man
's
room
unless
she
mean
to
consider
herself
as
engage
to
him

even
with
his
sister

not
though
he
have
break
every
bone
in
his
skin
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
may
do
,
Laura
,
and
I
know
what
I
may
not
;

I
will
not
be
lead
either
by
you

by
my

<EOS>
"
May
I
give
him
your
love

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

because
you
will
give
it
in
a
wrong
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
know
well
enough
that
I
wish
him
well
;
 
but
you
may
tell
him
that
from
me
,
if
you
please

<EOS>
He
have
from
me
all
those
wish
which
one
friend
owe
to
another

"
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
other
message
send
from
Violet
through
Phineas
Finn
which
she
word
with
more
show
of
affection
,
 
perhaps
as
much
for
the
discomfort
of
Phineas
as
for
the
consolation
of
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
tell
him
to
take
care
of
himself
,
"
say
Violet
,
"
and
bid
him
not
to
have
any
more
of
those
wild
brute
that
be
not
fit
for
any
Christian
to
ride
.
<EOS>
tell
him
that
I
say
so
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
thing
to
be
brave
;

what
be
the
use
of
be
foolhardy
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
session
be
to
be
close
at
the
end
of
June
,
to
the
great
dismay
of
London
tradesman
and
of
young
lady
who
have
not
be
entirely
successful
in
the
early
season
.
<EOS>
but
before
the
old
Parliament
be
close
,
and
the
writ
for
the
new
election
be
despatch
,
there
occur
an
incident
which
be
of
very
much
importance
to
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
near
the
end
of
June
,
when
the
remain
day
of
the
session
be
number
by
three
or
four
,
he
have
be
dine
at
Lord
Brentford
's
house
in
Portman
Square
in
company
with
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Laura
have
not
be
there
.
<EOS>
at
this
time
he
see
Lord
Brentford
not
unfrequently
,
and
there
be
always
a
word
say
about
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
the
father
would
ask
how
the
son
occupy
himself
,
and
Phineas
would
hope
,
 
though
hitherto
he
have
hope
in
vain
,
 
that
he
would
induce
the
Earl
to
come
and
see
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
could
never
be
bring
to
that
;
but
it
be
sufficiently
evident
that
he
would
have
do
so
,
have
he
not
be
afraid
to
descend
so
far
from
the
altitude
of
his
paternal
wrath
.
<EOS>
on
this
evening
,
at
about
eleven
,
Mr.
Kennedy
and
Phineas
leave
the
house
together
,
and
walk
from
the
Square
through
Orchard
Street
into
Oxford
Street
.
<EOS>
here
their
way
part
,
but
Phineas
cross
the
road
with
Mr.
Kennedy
,
as
he
be
make
some
reply
to
a
second
invitation
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
consider
what
have
be
say
before
on
the
subject
,
think
that
the
invitation
come
late
,
and
that
it
be
not
warmly
word
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
therefore
,
decline
it
,
and
be
in
the
act
of
decline
it
,
when
he
cross
the
road
with
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
in
walk
down
Orchard
Street
from
the
Square
he
have
see
two
man
stand
in
the
shadow
a
few
yard
up
a
mews
or
small
alley
that
be
there
,
but
have
think
nothing
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
that
period
of
the
year
when
there
be
hardly
any
of
the
darkness
of
night
;
but
at
this
moment
there
be
symptom
of
come
rain
,
and
heavy
drop
begin
to
fall
;
and
there
be
big
cloud
come
and
go
before
the
young
moon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
have
say
that
he
would
get
a
cab
,
but
he
have
see
none
as
he
cross
Oxford
Street
,
and
have
put
up
his
umbrella
as
he
make
his
way
towards
Park
Street
.
<EOS>
Phineas
as
he
leave
him
distinctly
perceive
the
same
two
figure
on
the
other
side
of
Oxford
Street
,
and
then
turn
into
the
shadow
of
a
butcher
's
porch
,
he
see
them
cross
the
street
in
the
wake
of
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
rain
in
earnest
,
and
the
few
passenger
who
be
out
be
scud
away
quickly
,
this
way
and
that
.
  
<EOS>
It
hardly
occur
to
Phineas
to
think
that
any
danger
be
imminent
to
Mr.
Kennedy
from
the
man
,
but
it
do
occur
to
him
that
he
may
as
well
take
some
notice
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Phineas
know
that
Mr.
Kennedy
would
make
his
way
down
Park
Street
,
that
be
his
usual
route
from
Portman
Square
towards
his
own
home
,
and
know
also
that
he
himself
could
again
come
across
Mr.
Kennedy
's
track
by
go
down
North
Audley
Street
to
the
corner
of
Grosvenor
Square
,
and
thence
by
Brook
Street
into
Park
Street
.
<EOS>
without
much
thought
,
therefore
,
he
go
out
of
his
own
course
down
to
the
corner
of
the
Square
,
hurry
his
step
till
he
be
run
,
and
then
run
along
Brook
Street
,
think
as
he
go
of
some
special
word
that
he
may
say
to
Mr.
Kennedy
as
an
excuse
,
should
he
again
come
across
his
late
companion
.
<EOS>
He
reach
the
corner
of
Park
Street
before
that
gentleman
could
have
be
there
unless
he
also
have
run
;
but
just
in
time
to
see
him
as
he
be
come
on
,
 
and
also
to
see
in
the
dark
glimmering
of
the
slight
uncertain
moonlight
that
the
two
man
be
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
retreat
a
step
backwards
in
the
corner
,
resolve
that
when
Mr.
Kennedy
come
up
,
they
two
would
go
on
together
;
for
now
it
be
clear
that
Mr.
Kennedy
be
follow
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Kennedy
do
not
reach
the
corner
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
within
two
door
of
it
,
one
of
the
man
have
follow
him
up
quickly
,
and
have
throw
something
round
his
throat
from
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Phineas
understand
well
now
that
his
friend
be
in
the
act
of
be
garrotte
,
and
that
his
instant
assistance
be
need
.
<EOS>
He
rush
forward
,
and
as
the
second
ruffian
have
be
close
upon
the
footstep
of
the
first
,
there
be
almost
instantaneously
a
concourse
of
the
four
man
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
fight
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
have
already
nearly
succeed
in
put
Mr.
Kennedy
on
to
his
back
,
make
no
attempt
to
seize
his
prey
when
he
find
that
so
unwelcome
an
addition
have
join
the
party
,
but
instantly
turn
to
fly
.
<EOS>
His
companion
be
turn
also
,
but
Phineas
be
too
quick
for
him
,
and
have
seize
on
to
his
collar
,
hold
to
him
with
all
his
power
.
<EOS>
"
dash
it
all
,
"
say
the
man
,
"
do
not
yer
see
as
how
I
be
a
-
hurrying
up
to
help
the
gen'leman
myself
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
phineas
,
however
,
have
not
see
this
,
and
hold
on
gallantly
,
and
in
a
couple
of
minute
the
first
ruffian
be
back
again
upon
the
spot
in
the
custody
of
a
policeman
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
do
it
uncommon
neat
,
sir
,
"
say
the
policeman
,
compliment
Phineas
upon
his
performance
.
<EOS>
"
if
the
gen'leman
be
not
none
the
bad
for
it
,
it
will
have
be
a
very
pretty
evening
's
amusement
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
be
now
lean
against
the
railing
,
and
hitherto
have
be
unable
to
declare
whether
he
be
really
injure
or
not
,
and
it
be
not
till
a
second
policeman
come
up
that
the
hero
of
the
night
be
at
liberty
to
attend
closely
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
when
he
be
able
to
speak
,
declare
that
for
a
minute
or
two
he
have
think
that
his
neck
have
be
break
;
and
he
be
not
quite
convinced
till
he
find
himself
in
his
own
house
,
that
nothing
more
serious
have
really
happen
to
him
than
certain
bruise
round
his
throat
.
<EOS>
the
policeman
be
for
a
while
anxious
that
at
any
rate
Phineas
should
go
with
him
to
the
police
-
office
;
but
at
last
consent
to
take
the
address
of
the
two
gentleman
.
<EOS>
when
he
find
that
Mr.
Kennedy
be
a
member
of
Parliament
,
and
that
he
be
designate
as
Right
Honourable
,
his
respect
for
the
garrotter
become
more
great
,
and
he
begin
to
feel
that
the
night
be
indeed
a
night
of
great
importance
.
<EOS>
He
express
unbounded
admiration
at
Mr.
Finn
's
success
in
his
own
line
,
and
make
repeated
promise
that
the
man
should
be
forthcoming
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Could
a
cab
be
get
?
<EOS>
of
course
a
cab
could
be
get
.
<EOS>
a
cab
be
get
,
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
making
of
the
attack
,
the
two
member
of
Parliament
be
on
their
way
to
Grosvenor
Place
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
hardly
a
word
speak
in
the
cab
,
for
Mr.
Kennedy
be
in
pain
.
<EOS>
when
,
however
,
they
reach
the
door
in
Grosvenor
Place
,
Phineas
want
to
go
,
and
leave
his
friend
with
the
servant
,
but
this
the
Cabinet
Minister
would
not
allow
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
must
see
my
wife
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
so
they
go
up
-
stair
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
then
upon
the
stair
,
by
the
light
of
the
house
,
Phineas
could
perceive
that
his
companion
's
face
be
bruise
and
black
with
dirt
,
and
that
his
cravat
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
garrotte
,
"
say
the
Cabinet
Minister
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
simply
that
;
 
or
should
have
be
,
if
he
have
not
be
there
.
<EOS>
how
he
come
there
,
God
only
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
wife
's
anxiety
,
and
then
her
gratitude
,
need
hardly
be
describe
,
 
nor
the
astonishment
of
the
husband
,
which
by
no
means
decrease
on
reflection
,
at
the
opportune
re
-
appearance
in
the
nick
of
time
of
the
man
whom
three
minute
before
the
attack
he
have
leave
in
the
act
of
go
in
the
opposite
direction
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
the
man
,
and
think
it
best
to
run
round
by
the
corner
of
Grosvenor
Square
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
God
bless
you
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
amen
,
"
say
the
Cabinet
Minister
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
be
bear
to
be
my
friend
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
the
Cabinet
Minister
say
nothing
more
that
night
.
<EOS>
He
be
never
give
to
much
talking
,
and
the
little
accident
which
have
just
occur
to
him
do
not
tend
to
make
word
easy
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
press
our
hero
's
hand
,
and
Lady
Laura
say
that
of
course
Phineas
would
come
to
them
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Phineas
remark
that
his
first
business
must
be
to
go
to
the
police
-
office
,
but
he
promise
that
he
would
come
down
to
Grosvenor
Place
immediately
afterwards
.
<EOS>
then
Lady
Laura
also
press
his
hand
,
and
look
 
;
she
look
,
I
think
,
as
though
she
think
that
Phineas
would
only
have
do
right
have
he
repeat
the
offence
which
he
have
commit
under
the
waterfall
of
Loughlinter
.
  
<EOS>
"
garrotte
!
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
,
when
Phineas
tell
him
the
story
before
they

He
have
be
smoke
,
sip
brandy

and

water

and
wait
for
Finn
's
return

"
<EOS>
Robert
Kennedy
garrotte
!

<EOS>
"
the
fellow
be
in
the
act

do
it

and
you
stop
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
get
there
just
in

be
not
it
lucky

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
be
garrotte
yourself

I
should
have
lend
the

a

I
be
there

"
how
can
you

anything

horrible

much

I
shall
lock

up

"
  
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
no
one
in
London
drink
more
than
I
do
,
the
wine
merchant
would
have
a
bad
time
of
it

<EOS>
and
so
the
new
Cabinet
Minister
have
be
garrotte
in
the
street

<EOS>
of
course
I
be
sorry
for
poor

luckily
he

for

only
a
little
bruise

I
wonder
whether
it

by
it

worse

I
be
oblige
to
you

rescue
him

<EOS>
come

I
will
go

<EOS>
I
must
say
,
if
he

garrotte
I
should
like
to
have
be
there
to
see
it

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that

the
manner

<EOS>
"
a
good
deal
be
say
about
it
to
Phineas
at

club

a
word

two
that
be
say
to
him
by
Violet

worth
all
the
rest

He
know
that
such

nothing

from

I
get
the
advantage

it

<EOS>
since
that
he
have
pay
his
brother

debt
for
the
fifteenth
time
,
and
of
course
be
ready
to
fight
any
battle
for
the
forgive
prodigal

<EOS>
thing
be
not
as
they
be
,
and
my
father
tell
me
that
he
think
I
shall
be
beat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
bad
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
what
I
have
a
right
to
expect
.
"
  
<EOS>
every
word
of
information
that
have
come
to
Phineas
about
Loughshane
since
Mr.
Mildmay
have
decide
upon
a
dissolution
,
have
go
towards
make
him
feel
at
first
that
there
be
a
great
doubt
as
to
his
re
-
election
,
and
at
last
that
there
be
almost
a
certainty
against
him
.
<EOS>
and
as
these
tiding
reach
him
they
make
him
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
since
he
have
be
in
Parliament
he
have
very
frequently
regret
that
he
have
leave
the
shade
of
the
Inns
of
Court
for
the
glare
of
Westminster
;
and
he
have
more
than
once
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
desert
the
glare
and
return
to
the
shade
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
when
the
moment
come
in
which
such
desertion
seem
to
be
compulsory
on
him
,
when
there
would
be
no
longer
a
choice
,
the
seat
in
Parliament
be
dearer
to
him
than
ever
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
go
of
his
own
free
will
,
 
so
he
tell
himself
,
 
there
would
have
be
something
of
nobility
in
such
going
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
would
have
respect
him
,
and
even
Mrs.
Low
may
have
take
him
back
to
the
friendship
of
her
severe
bosom
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
go
back
now
as
a
cur
with
his
tail
between
his
leg
,
 
kick
out
,
as
it
be
,
from
Parliament
.
<EOS>
return
to
Lincoln
's
Inn
soil
with
failure
,
have
accomplish
nothing
,
have
break
down
on
the
only
occasion
on
which
he
have
dare
to
show
himself
on
his
leg
,
not
have
open
a
single
useful
book
during
the
two
year
in
which
he
have
sit
in
Parliament
,
burden
with
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
's
debt
,
and
not
quite
free
from
debt
of
his
own
,
how
could
he
start
himself
in
any
way
by
which
he
may
even
hope
to
win
success
?
<EOS>
He
must
,
he
tell
himself
,
give
up
all
thought
of
practise
in
London
and
betake
himself
to
Dublin
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
dare
to
face
his
friend
in
London
as
a
young
briefless
barrister
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
evening
,
the
evening
subsequent
to
that
on
which
Mr.
Kennedy
have
be
attack
,
the
House
be
sit
in
Committee
of
Ways
and
Means
,
and
there
come
on
a
discussion
as
to
a
certain
vote
for
the
army
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
know
that
there
would
be
such
discussion
;
and
Mr.
Monk
have
hear
from
Phineas
a
word
or
two
now
and
again
about
the
pot
pea
,
have
recommend
him
to
be
ready
with
a
few
remark
if
he
wish
to
support
the
Government
in
the
matter
of
that
vote
.
<EOS>
Phineas
do
so
wish
,
have
learn
quite
enough
in
the
Committee
Room
up
-
stair
to
make
him
believe
that
a
large
importation
of
the
pot
pea
from
Holstein
would
not
be
for
the
advantage
of
the
army
or
navy
,
 
or
for
that
of
the
country
at
large
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
have
make
his
suggestion
without
the
slight
allusion
to
the
former
failure
,
 
just
as
though
Phineas
be
a
practise
speaker
accustomed
to
be
on
his
leg
three
or
four
time
a
week
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
find
a
chance
,
I
will
,
"
say
Phineas
,
take
the
advice
just
as
it
be
give
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
prayer
,
a
word
be
say
in
the
House
as
to
the
ill
-
fortune
which
have
befall
the
new
Cabinet
Minister
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
have
ask
Mr.
Mildmay
whether
violent
hand
have
not
be
lay
in
the
dead
of
night
on
the
sacred
throat
,
 
the
throat
that
should
have
be
sacred
,
 
of
the
new
Chancellor
of
the
duchy
of
Lancaster
;
and
have
express
regret
that
the
Ministry
,
 
which
be
,
he
fear
,
in
other
respect
somewhat
infirm
,
 
should
now
have
be
further
weaken
by
this
injury
to
that
new
bulwark
with
which
it
have
endeavour
to
support
itself
.
<EOS>
the
Prime
Minister
,
answer
his
old
rival
in
the
same
strain
,
say
that
the
calamity
may
have
be
very
severe
,
both
to
the
country
and
to
the
Cabinet
;
but
that
fortunately
for
the
community
at
large
,
a
gallant
young
member
of
that
House
,
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
proud
to
say
a
supporter
of
the
Government
<EOS>
,
 
have
appear
upon
the
spot
at
the
nick
of
time
;
 
"
<EOS>
as
a
god
out
of
a
machine
,
"
say
Mr.
Daubeny
,
interrupt
him
;
 
<EOS>
"
by
no
mean
as
a
god
out
of
a
machine
,
"
continue
Mr.
Mildmay
,
"
but
as
a
real
help
in
a
very
real
trouble
,
and
succeed
not
only
in
save
my
right
honourable
friend
,
the
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
,
but
in
arrest
the
two
malefactor
who
attempt
to
rob
him
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
"
then
there
be
a
cry
of
"
name
;
"
and
Mr.
Mildmay
of
course
name
the
member
for
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
It
so
happen
that
Phineas
be
not
in
the
House
,
but
he
hear
it
all
when
he
come
down
to
attend
the
Committee
of
Ways
and
Means
.
  
<EOS>
then
come
on
the
discussion
about
provision
in
the
army
,
the
subject
be
moot
by
one
of
Mr.
Turnbull
's
close
ally
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
who
have
move
for
the
Potted
Peas
Committee
,
be
silent
on
the
occasion
,
have
feel
that
the
result
of
that
committee
have
not
be
exactly
what
he
have
expect
.
<EOS>
the
evidence
respect
such
of
the
Holstein
pot
pea
as
have
be
use
in
this
country
be
not
very
favourable
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
the
rebound
from
that
committee
,
 
the
very
fact
that
such
a
committee
have
be
make
to
sit
,
 
give
ground
for
a
hostile
attack
.
<EOS>
to
attack
be
so
easy
,
when
a
complete
refutation
barely
suffice
to
save
the
Minister
<EOS>
attack
,
 
do
not
suffice
to
save
him
from
future
dim
memory
of
something
have
be
wrong
,
 
and
bring
down
no
disgrace
whatsoever
on
the
promoter
of
the
false
charge
.
<EOS>
the
promoter
of
the
false
charge
simply
express
his
gratification
at
find
that
he
have
be
mislead
by
erroneous
information
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
customary
for
him
to
express
gratification
at
the
fact
,
that
out
of
all
the
mud
which
he
have
throw
,
some
will
probably
stick
!
<EOS>
Phineas
,
when
the
time
come
,
do
get
on
his
leg
,
and
speak
perhaps
two
or
three
dozen
word
.
<EOS>
the
do
so
seem
to
come
to
him
quite
naturally
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
very
little
about
it
beforehand
,
 
have
resolve
not
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
the
occasion
be
one
of
no
great
importance
.
<EOS>
the
Speaker
be
not
in
the
chair
,
and
the
House
be
thin
,
and
he
intend
to
make
no
speech
,
 
merely
to
say
something
which
he
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
till
he
have
finish
he
hardly
remember
that
he
be
do
that
,
in
attempt
to
do
which
he
have
before
fail
so
egregiously
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
he
sit
down
that
he
begin
to
ask
himself
whether
the
scene
be
swim
before
his
eye
as
it
have
do
on
former
occasion
;
as
it
have
do
even
when
he
have
so
much
as
thought
of
make
a
speech
.
<EOS>
now
he
be
astonish
at
the
easiness
of
the
thing
,
and
as
he
leave
the
House
tell
himself
that
he
have
overcome
the
difficulty
just
when
the
victory
could
be
of
no
avail
to
him
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
more
eager
,
more
constant
in
his
purpose
,
he
may
at
any
rate
have
show
the
world
that
he
be
fit
for
the
place
which
he
have
presume
to
take
before
he
be
cast
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
he
receive
a
letter
from
his
father
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Finn
have
see
Lord
Tulla
,
have
be
send
for
to
relieve
his
lordship
in
a
fit
of
the
gout
,
and
have
be
inform
by
the
Earl
that
he
mean
to
fight
the
borough
to
the
last
man
;
 
<EOS>
have
he
say
to
the
last
shilling
he
would
have
speak
with
perhaps
more
accuracy
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
doctor
,
your
son
have
have
it
for
two
year
,
as
you
may
say
for
nothing
,
and
I
think
he
ought
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
expect
that
he
be
to
go
on
there
as
though
it
be
his
own
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
his
lordship
,
upon
whom
this
touch
of
the
gout
have
come
somewhat
sharply
,
express
himself
with
considerable
animation
.
<EOS>
the
old
doctor
behave
with
much
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
the
Earl
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
I
could
not
undertake
to
say
what
you
may
do
;
but
that
as
you
have
come
forward
at
first
with
my
sanction
,
I
could
not
withdraw
it
now
.
<EOS>
He
ask
me
if
I
should
support
you
with
money
;
I
say
that
I
should
to
a
moderate
extent
.
"
<EOS>
by
G
 
,
"
say
the
Earl
,
"
a
moderate
extent
will
go
a
very
little
way
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
<EOS>
since
that
he
have
have
Duggin
with
him
;
so
,
I
suppose
,
I
shall
not
see
him
any
more
.
<EOS>
You
can
do
as
you
please
now
;
but
,
from
what
I
hear
,
I
fear
you
will
have
no
chance
.
"
<EOS>
then
with
much
bitterness
of
spirit
Phineas
resolve
that
he
would
not
interfere
with
Lord
Tulla
at
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
at
once
to
the
Reform
Club
and
explain
his
reason
to
Barrington
Erle
and
other
there
who
would
be
interested
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
first
go
to
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
here
he
be
show
up
into
Mr.
Kennedy
's
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
be
up
and
seat
in
an
arm
-
chair
by
an
open
window
look
over
into
the
Queen
's
garden
;
but
he
be
in
his
dressing
-
gown
,
and
be
to
be
regard
as
an
invalid
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
as
he
could
not
turn
his
neck
,
or
think
that
he
could
not
do
so
<EOS>
,
he
be
not
very
fit
to
go
out
about
his
work
.
<EOS>
let
us
hope
that
the
affair
of
the
Duchy
of
Lancaster
do
not
suffer
materially
by
his
absence
.
<EOS>
We
may
take
it
for
grant
that
<EOS>
with
a
man
so
sedulous
as
to
all
his
duty
there
be
no
arrear
of
work
when
the
accident
take
place
.
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
hand
to
Phineas
,
and
say
some
word
in
a
whisper
,
 
some
word
or
two
among
which
Phineas
catch
the
sound
of
"
pot
pea
,
"
 
and
then
continue
to
look
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
who
be
utterly
prostrate
by
any
bodily
ailment
,
and
it
seem
that
Mr.
Kennedy
be
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
be
full
of
his
own
bad
news
,
have
intend
to
tell
his
sad
story
at
once
.
<EOS>
but
he
perceive
that
the
neck
of
the
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
be
too
stiff
to
allow
of
his
take
any
interest
in
external
matter
,
and
so
he
refrain
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
the
doctor
say
about
it
?
"
say
Phineas
,
perceive
that
just
for
the
present
there
could
be
only
one
possible
subject
for
remark
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
be
begin
to
describe
in
a
long
whisper
what
the
doctor
do
think
about
it
,
when
Lady
Laura
come
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
they
begin
at
first
to
talk
about
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
be
kind
to
him
not
to
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
and
Lady
Laura
make
much
of
the
injury
,
as
it
behove
a
wife
to
do
in
such
circumstance
for
the
sake
both
of
the
sufferer
and
of
the
hero
.
<EOS>
She
declare
her
conviction
<EOS>
that
have
Phineas
be
a
moment
later
her
husband
's
neck
would
have
be
irredeemably
break
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
they
ever
do
kill
the
people
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
they
do
not
mean
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
do
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
not
,
"
say
Phineas
,
eager
in
the
cause
of
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
this
man
be
very
clumsy
,
"
whisper
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
be
a
beginner
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
and
that
may
make
a
difference
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
I
be
afraid
we
have
interfere
with
his
education
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
,
by
degree
,
the
conversation
get
away
to
other
thing
,
and
Lady
Laura
ask
him
after
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
give
it
up
,
"
say
he
,
smile
as
he
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
there
be
but
a
bad
chance
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
smile
also
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
have
behave
so
well
!
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
write
to
say
he
will
find
the
money
,
if
I
determine
to
contest
the
borough
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
write
to
him
by
to
-
night
's
post
to
decline
the
offer
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
spend
the
money
,
and
I
should
not
succeed
if
I
do
spend
it
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
make
me
a
little
down
in
the
mouth
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
smile
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
a
plan
of
my
own
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
plan
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
or
rather
it
be
not
mine
,
but
papa
's
.
<EOS>
old
Mr.
Standish
be
go
to
give
up
Loughton
,
and
papa
want
you
to
come
and
try
your
luck
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Laura
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
quite
a
certainty
,
you
know
,
but
I
suppose
it
be
as
near
a
certainty
as
anything
leave
.
"
<EOS>
and
this
come
from
a
strong
Radical
Reformer
!
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Laura
,
I
could
not
accept
such
a
favour
from
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Kennedy
nod
his
head
very
slightly
and
whisper
,
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
think
of
it
,
"
say
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
such
a
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
matter
entirely
for
papa
's
consideration
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
with
an
affectation
of
solemnity
in
her
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
have
always
be
feel
that
any
politician
may
accept
such
an
offer
as
that
when
it
be
make
to
him
,
but
that
no
politician
should
ask
for
it
.
<EOS>
My
father
feel
that
he
have
to
do
the
good
he
can
with
his
influence
in
the
borough
,
and
therefore
he
come
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
that
,
"
say
Phineas
,
somewhat
rudely
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
private
feeling
have
their
weight
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
probable
that
papa
would
have
go
to
a
perfect
stranger
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
may
own
that
Mr.
Kennedy
and
I
would
both
be
very
sorry
that
you
should
not
be
in
the
House
,
and
that
that
feeling
on
our
part
have
have
some
weight
with
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
will
stand
?
"
whisper
Mr.
Kennedy
,
still
look
straight
out
of
the
window
,
as
though
the
slight
attempt
to
turn
his
neck
would
be
fraught
with
danger
to
himself
and
the
duchy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
have
desire
me
to
ask
you
to
call
upon
him
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
there
be
very
much
to
be
say
,
as
each
of
you
know
<EOS>
so
well
the
other
's
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
better
see
him
to
-
day
or
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
Phineas
be
persuade
before
he
leave
Mr.
Kennedy
's
room
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
when
he
come
to
think
of
it
,
there
appear
to
him
to
be
no
valid
reason
why
he
should
not
sit
for
Loughton
.
<EOS>
the
favour
be
of
a
kind
that
have
prevail
from
time
out
of
mind
in
England
,
between
the
most
respectable
of
the
great
land
magnate
,
and
young
rise
liberal
politician
.
<EOS>
Burke
,
Fox
,
and
Canning
have
all
be
place
in
Parliament
by
similar
influence
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
desire
earnestly
,
 
long
in
his
very
heart
of
heart
,
 
to
extinguish
all
such
parliamentary
influence
,
to
root
out
for
ever
the
last
vestige
of
close
borough
nomination
;
but
while
the
thing
remain
it
be
well
that
the
thing
should
contribute
to
the
liberal
than
to
the
conservative
strength
of
the
House
,
 
and
if
to
the
liberal
<EOS>
,
how
be
this
to
be
achieve
but
by
the
acceptance
of
such
influence
by
some
liberal
candidate
?
<EOS>
and
if
it
be
right
that
it
should
be
accept
by
any
liberal
candidate
,
 
then
,
why
not
by
him
?
<EOS>
the
logic
of
this
argument
seem
to
him
to
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
He
feel
something
like
a
sting
of
reproach
as
he
tell
himself
that
in
truth
this
great
offer
be
make
to
him
,
not
on
account
of
the
excellence
of
his
politic
,
but
because
he
have
be
instrumental
in
save
Lord
Brentford
's
son
-
in
-
law
from
the
violence
of
garrotter
.
<EOS>
but
he
crush
these
qualm
of
conscience
as
be
over
-
scrupulous
,
and
,
as
he
tell
himself
,
not
practical
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
the
world
as
you
find
it
,
with
a
struggle
to
be
something
more
honest
than
those
around
you
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
preach
to
himself
this
sermon
,
declare
to
himself
that
they
who
attempt
more
than
this
fly
too
high
in
the
cloud
to
be
of
service
to
man
and
woman
upon
earth
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
do
not
see
Lord
Brentford
that
day
he
postpone
write
to
his
father
for
twenty
-
four
hour
.
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
he
find
the
Earl
at
home
in
Portman
Square
,
have
first
discuss
the
matter
fully
with
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
scruple
about
me
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
;
"
you
be
quite
welcome
to
the
borough
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
I
do
not
stand
,
would
you
do
so
?
<EOS>
there
be
so
many
reason
which
ought
to
induce
you
to
accept
a
seat
in
Parliament
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
whether
that
be
true
or
not
,
Phineas
,
I
shall
not
accept
my
father
's
interest
at
Loughton
,
unless
it
be
offer
to
me
in
a
way
in
which
it
never
will
be
offer
.
<EOS>
You
know
me
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
I
shall
not
change
my
mind
.
<EOS>
nor
will
he
.
<EOS>
and
,
therefore
,
you
may
go
down
to
Loughton
with
a
pure
conscience
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
have
his
interview
with
the
Earl
,
and
in
ten
minute
everything
be
settle
.
<EOS>
on
his
way
to
Portman
Square
there
have
come
across
his
mind
the
idea
of
a
grand
effort
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
what
if
he
could
persuade
the
father
so
to
conduct
himself
towards
his
son
,
that
the
son
should
consent
to
be
a
member
for
the
borough
?
<EOS>
and
he
do
say
a
word
or
two
to
this
effect
,
set
forth
that
Lord
Chiltern
would
condescend
to
become
a
legislator
,
if
only
his
father
would
condescend
to
acknowledge
his
son
's
fitness
for
such
work
without
any
comment
on
the
son
's
past
life
.
<EOS>
but
the
Earl
simply
waive
the
subject
away
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
could
be
as
obstinate
as
his
son
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
be
the
Mercury
between
them
on
this
subject
,
and
Lady
Laura
have
fail
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
now
consent
to
employ
another
Mercury
.
<EOS>
very
little
,
 
hardly
a
word
<EOS>
indeed
,
 
be
say
between
the
Earl
and
Phineas
about
politic
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
to
be
the
Saulsby
candidate
at
Loughton
for
the
next
election
,
and
be
to
come
to
Saulsby
with
the
Kennedys
from
Loughlinter
,
 
either
with
the
Kennedys
or
somewhat
in
advance
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
that
there
will
be
no
opposition
,
"
say
the
Earl
,
"
but
I
expect
none
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
very
courteous
,
 
nay
,
he
be
kind
,
feel
doubtless
that
his
family
owe
a
great
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
young
man
with
whom
he
be
converse
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
there
be
not
absent
on
his
part
a
touch
of
that
high
condescension
which
,
perhaps
,
may
be
think
to
become
the
Earl
,
the
Cabinet
Minister
,
and
the
great
borough
patron
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
be
sensitive
,
feel
this
and
winced
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
quite
like
Lord
Brentford
,
and
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
so
now
in
spite
of
the
kindness
which
the
Earl
be
show
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
very
happy
when
he
sit
down
to
write
to
his
father
from
the
club
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
tell
him
that
the
money
should
be
forthcoming
for
the
election
at
Loughshane
,
if
he
resolve
to
stand
,
but
that
the
chance
of
success
would
be
very
slight
,
 
indeed
that
,
in
his
opinion
,
there
would
be
no
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
his
father
have
evidently
believe
,
when
write
,
that
Phineas
would
not
abandon
his
seat
without
a
useless
and
expensive
contest
.
<EOS>
He
now
thank
his
father
with
many
expression
of
gratitude
,
 
declare
his
conviction
that
his
father
be
right
about
Lord
Tulla
,
and
then
,
in
the
most
modest
language
that
he
could
use
,
go
on
to
say
that
he
have
find
another
borough
open
to
him
in
England
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
stand
for
Loughton
,
with
the
assistance
of
Lord
Brentford
,
and
think
that
the
election
would
probably
not
cost
him
above
a
couple
of
hundred
pound
at
the
outside
.
<EOS>
then
he
write
a
very
pretty
note
to
Lord
Tulla
,
thank
him
for
his
former
kindness
,
and
tell
the
Irish
Earl
that
it
be
not
his
intention
to
interfere
with
the
borough
of
Loughshane
at
the
next
election
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
this
Phineas
be
very
much
surprised
at
a
visit
that
be
make
to
him
at
his
lodging
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
,
after
that
scene
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
,
call
again
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
 
and
be
admit
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
let
him
sit
in
your
armchair
for
half
an
hour
or
so
,
"
Fitzgibbon
have
say
;
and
Phineas
almost
believe
that
it
would
be
well
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
a
terrible
nuisance
to
him
,
and
he
be
begin
to
think
that
he
have
well
undertake
to
pay
the
debt
by
degree
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
he
know
,
quite
on
the
card
that
Mr.
Clarkson
should
have
him
arrest
while
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
since
that
scene
in
the
lobby
Mr.
Clarkson
have
be
with
him
twice
,
and
there
have
be
a
preliminary
conversation
as
to
real
payment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
want
a
hundred
pound
down
,
and
another
bill
for
two
hundred
and
twenty
at
three
month
'
date
.
<EOS>
"
think
of
my
time
and
trouble
in
come
here
,
"
Mr.
Clarkson
have
urge
when
Phineas
have
object
to
these
term
.
<EOS>
"
think
of
my
time
and
trouble
,
and
do
be
punctual
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
have
offer
him
ten
pound
a
quarter
,
the
payment
to
be
mark
on
the
back
of
the
bill
,
a
tender
which
Mr.
Clarkson
have
not
seem
to
regard
as
strong
evidence
of
punctuality
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
angry
,
but
have
simply
express
his
intention
of
call
again
,
 
give
Phineas
to
understand
that
business
would
probably
take
him
to
the
west
of
Ireland
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
if
only
business
may
not
take
him
down
either
to
Loughlinter
or
to
Saulsby
!
<EOS>
but
the
strange
visitor
who
come
to
Phineas
in
the
midst
of
these
trouble
put
an
end
to
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
strange
visitor

either
this

I

never

I
hear
it

<EOS>
I
know
before
that
you
have
be
foolish
enough
to
help
Laurence
about
money
,
and
so
I
put
two
and
two
together
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
first
time
I
have
have
to
do
with
Mr.
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
so
I
send
to
him
,
and
I
have
buy
the
bill
.
<EOS>
there
it
be
.
"
<EOS>
and
Miss
Fitzgibbon
produce
the
document
which
bear
the
name
of
Phineas
Finn
across
the
front
of

<EOS>
"
and
do
you
pay
him
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
for
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
quite

<EOS>
I
have
a

hard
tussle

get
it
at
last
for
two
hundred

twenty
pound

do
you

yourself

"
<EOS>
all
myself

if
I
have
employ
a
lawyer
I
should
have
have
to
pay
two
hundred
and
forty
pound
and
five
pound
for
cost
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
Mr.

,
I
hope
you
will
not
have
any
more
money
engagement
with
my
brother
Laurence

"
<EOS>
Phineas
say
that
he
think
he
may
promise
that

no
more

<EOS>
because

if

do

if

money
out

there
would
be
no

<EOS>
Mr.

very
soon

spend
his

in
my
drawing

<EOS>
good
-
bye
,
Mr.

<EOS>
if
Laurence
say
anything
,
just
tell
him
that
he
would
better
come
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
then
Phineas
be
leave
look
at
the
bill
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
a
great
relief
to
him
,
 
that
he
should
be
thus
secure
from
the
domiciliary
visit
of
Mr.
Clarkson
;
a
great
relief
to
him
to
be
assure
that
Mr.
Clarkson
would
not
find
him
out
down
at
Loughton
;
but
nevertheless
,
he
have
to
suffer
a
pang
of
shame
as
he
feel
that
Miss
Fitzgibbon
have
become
acquaint
with
his
poverty
and
have
find
herself
oblige
to
satisfy
his
pecuniary
liability
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
's
Headache
 
Phineas
go
down
to
Loughlinter
early
in
July
,
take
Loughton
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
stay
there
one
night
at
the
inn
,
and
be
introduce
to
sundry
influential
inhabitant
of
the
borough
by
Mr.
Grating
,
the
ironmonger
,
who
be
know
by
those
who
know
Loughton
to
be
a
very
strong
supporter
of
the
Earl
's
interest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grating
and
about
half
a
dozen
other
of
the
tradesman
of
the
town
come
to
the
inn
,
and
meet
Phineas
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
He
tell
them
he
be
a
good
sound
Liberal
and
a
supporter
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
Government
,
of
which
their
neighbour
the
Earl
be
so
conspicuous
an
ornament
.
<EOS>
this
be
almost
all
that
be
say
about
the
Earl
out
loud
;
but
each
individual
man
of
Loughton
then
present
take
an
opportunity
during
the
meeting
of
whisper
into
Mr.
Finn
's
ear
a
word
or
two
to
show
that
he
also
be
admit
to
the
secret
council
of
the
borough
,
 
that
he
too
could
see
the
inside
of
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
we
must
support
the
Earl
,
"
one
say
.
<EOS>
"
never
mind
what
you
hear
about
a
Tory
candidate
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
whisper
a
second
;
"
the
Earl
can
do
what
he
please
here
.
"
<EOS>
and
it
seem
to
Phineas
that
it
be
think
by
them
all
to
be
rather
a
fine
thing
to
be
thus
hold
in
the
hand
by
an
english
nobleman
.
<EOS>
Phineas
could
not
but
reflect
much
upon
this
as
he
lie
in
his
bed
at
the
Loughton
inn
.
<EOS>
the
great
political
question
on
which
the
political
world
be
engross
up
in
London
be
the
enfranchisement
of
Englishmen
,
 
of
Englishmen
down
to
the
rank
of
artisan
and
labourer
;
 
and
yet
when
he
find
himself
in
contact
with
individual
Englishmen
,
with
man
even
very
much
above
the
artisan
and
the
labourer
,
he
find
that
they
rather
like
be
bind
hand
and
foot
,
and
be
keep
as
tool
in
the
political
pocket
of
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
every
one
of
those
Loughton
tradesman
be
proud
of
his
own
personal
subjection
to
the
Earl
!
  
<EOS>
from
Loughton
he
go
to
Loughlinter
,
have
promise
to
be
back
in
the
borough
for
the
election
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grating
would
propose
him
,
and
he
be
to
be
second
by
Mr.
Shortribs
,
the
butcher
and
grazier
.
<EOS>
mention
have
be
make
of
a
conservative
candidate
,
and
Mr.
Shortribs
have
seem
to
think
that
a
good
stand
-
up
fight
upon
english
principle
,
with
a
clear
understanding
,
of
course
,
that
victory
should
prevail
on
the
liberal
side
,
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
borough
.
<EOS>
but
the
Earl
's
man
of
business
see
Phineas
on
the
morning
of
his
departure
,
and
tell
him
not
to
regard
Mr.
Shortribs
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
all
like
it
,
"
say
the
man
of
business
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
daresay
they
will
have
enough
of
it
when
this
Reform
Bill
be
pass
;
but
at
present
no
one
will
be
fool
enough
to
come
and
spend
his
money
here
.
<EOS>
We
have
them
all
in
hand
too
well
for
that
,
Mr.
Finn
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
find
the
great
house
at
Loughlinter
nearly
empty
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
's
mother
be
there
,
and
Lord
Brentford
be
there
,
and
Lord
Brentford
's
private
secretary
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
's
private
secretary
.
<EOS>
at
present
that
be
the
entire
party
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
be
expect
there
,
with
her
daughter
and
Violet
Effingham
;
but
,
as
well
as
Phineas
could
learn
,
they
would
not
be
at
Loughlinter
until
after
he
have
leave
it
.
<EOS>
there
have
come
up
lately
a
rumour
that
there
would
be
an
autumn
session
,
 
that
the
Houses
would
sit
through
October
and
a
part
of
November
,
in
order
that
Mr.
Mildmay
may
try
the
feeling
of
the
new
Parliament
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
to
be
so
,
Phineas
have
resolve
that
,
in
the
event
of
his
election
at
Loughton
,
he
would
not
return
to
Ireland
till
after
this
autumn
session
should
be
over
.
<EOS>
He
give
an
account
to
the
Earl
,
in
the
presence
of
the
Earl
's
son
-
in
-
law
,
of
what
have
take
place
at
Loughton
,
and
the
Earl
express
himself
as
satisfied
.
<EOS>
It
be
manifestly
a
great
satisfaction
to
Lord
Brentford
that
he
should
still
have
a
borough
in
his
pocket
,
and
the
more
so
because
there
be
<EOS>
so
very
few
nobleman
leave
who
have
such
property
belong
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
careful
in
his
speech
,
never
say
in
so
many
word
that
the
privilege
of
return
a
member
be
his
own
;
but
his
meaning
be
not
the
less
clear
.
  
<EOS>
those
be
dreary
day
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
there
be
fishing
,
 
if
Phineas
choose
to
fish
;
and
he
be
tell
that
he
could
shoot
a
deer
if
he
be
minded
to
go
out
alone
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
as
though
it
be
the
intention
of
the
host
that
his
guest
should
spend
their
time
profitably
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
himself
be
shut
up
with
book
and
paper
all
the
morning
,
and
always
take
up
a
book
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
also
would
read
a
little
,
 
and
then
would
sleep
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
Old
Mrs.
Kennedy
sleep
also
,
and
Lady
Laura
look
as
though
she
would
like
to
sleep
if
it
be
not
that
her
husband
's
eye
be
upon
her
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
administer
tea
,
Mr.
Kennedy
not
like
the
practice
of
have
it
hand
round
by
a
servant
when
none
be
there
but
member
of
the
family
circle
,
and
she
read
novel
.
<EOS>
Phineas
get
hold
of
a
stiff
bit
of
read
for
himself
,
and
try
to
utilise
his
time
.
<EOS>
He
take
Alison
in
hand
,
and
work
his
way
gallantly
through
a
couple
of
volume
.
<EOS>
but
even
he
,
more
than
once
or
twice
,
find
himself
on
the
very
verge
of
slumber
.
<EOS>
then
he
would
wake
up
and
try
to
think
about
thing
.
<EOS>
why
be
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
an
Irishman
from
Killaloe
,
live
in
that
great
house
of
Loughlinter
as
though
he
be
one
of
the
family
,
strive
to
kill
the
hour
,
and
feeling
that
he
be
in
some
way
subject
to
the
dominion
of
his
host
?
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
well
for
him
to
get
up
and
go
away
?
<EOS>
in
his
heart
of
heart
he
do
not
like
Mr.
Kennedy
,
though
he
believe
him
to
be
a
good
man
.
<EOS>
and
of
what
service
to
him
be
it
to
like
Lady
Laura
,
now
that
Lady
Laura
be
a
possession
in
the
hand
of
Mr.
Kennedy
?
<EOS>
then
he
would
tell
himself
that
he
owe
his
position
in
the
world
entirely
to
Lady
Laura
,
and
that
he
be
ungrateful
to
feel
himself
ever
dull
in
her
society
.
<EOS>
and
,
moreover
,
there
be
something
to
be
do
in
the
world
beyond
make
love
and
be
merry
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
could
occupy
himself
with
a
blue
book
for
hour
together
without
wince
.
<EOS>
so
Phineas
go
to
work
again
with
his
Alison
,
and
read
away
till
he
nod
.
  
<EOS>
in
those
day
he
often
wander
up
and
down
the
Linter
and
across
the
moor
to
the
Linn
,
and
so
down
to
the
lake
.
<EOS>
He
would
take
a
book
with
him
,
and
would
seat
himself
down
on
spot
which
he
love
,
and
would
pretend
to
read
;
 
but
I
do
not
think
that
he
get
much
advantage
from
his
book
.
<EOS>
He
be
think
of
his
life
,
and
try
to
calculate
whether
the
wonderful
success
which
he
have
achieve
would
ever
be
of
permanent
value
to
him
.
<EOS>
Would
he
be
nearer
to
earn
his
bread
when
he
should
be
member
for
Loughton
than
he
have
be
when
he
be
member
for
Loughshane
?
<EOS>
or
be
there
before
him
any
slight
probability
that
he
would
ever
earn
his
bread
?
<EOS>
and
then
he
think
of
Violet
Effingham
,
and
be
angry
with
himself
for
remember
at
that
moment
that
Violet
Effingham
be
the
mistress
of
a
large
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
once
before
when
he
be
sit
beside
the
Linter
he
have
make
up
his
mind
to
declare
his
passion
to
Lady
Laura
;
 
and
he
have
do
so
on
the
very
spot
.
<EOS>
now
,
within
a
twelvemonth
of
that
time
,
he
make
up
his
mind
on
the
same
spot
to
declare
his
passion
to
Miss
Effingham
,
and
he
think
his
good
mode
of
carry
his
suit
would
be
to
secure
the
assistance
of
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
,
no
doubt
,
have
be
very
anxious
that
her
brother
should
marry
violet
;
but
Lord
Chiltern
,
as
Phineas
know
,
have
ask
for
Violet
's
hand
twice
in
vain
;
and
,
moreover
,
Chiltern
himself
have
declare
to
Phineas
that
he
would
never
ask
for
it
again
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
,
who
be
always
reasonable
,
would
surely
perceive
that
there
be
no
hope
of
success
for
her
brother
.
<EOS>
that
Chiltern
would
quarrel
with
him
,
 
would
quarrel
with
him
to
the
knife
,
 
he
do
not
doubt
;
but
he
feel
that
no
fear
of
such
a
quarrel
as
that
should
deter
him
.
<EOS>
He
love
Violet
Effingham
,
and
he
must
indeed
be
pusillanimous
if
,
love
her
as
he
do
,
he
be
deter
from
express
his
love
from
any
fear
of
a
suitor
whom
she
do
not
favour
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
willingly
be
untrue
to
his
friendship
for
Lady
Laura
's
brother
.
<EOS>
have
there
be
a
chance
for
Lord
Chiltern
he
would
have
abstain
from
put
himself
forward
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
use
of
his
abstaining
,
when
by
do
so
he
could
in
no
wise
benefit
his
friend
,
 
when
the
result
of
his
do
so
would
be
that
some
interloper
would
come
in
and
carry
off
the
prize
?
<EOS>
He
would
explain
all
this
to
Lady
Laura
,
and
,
if
the
prize
would
be
kind
to
him
,
he
would
disregard
the
anger
of
Lord
Chiltern
,
even
though
it
may
be
anger
to
the
knife
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
be
think
of
all
this
Lady
Laura
stand
before
him
where
he
be
sit
at
the
top
of
the
fall
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
he
remember
well
all
the
circumstance
of
the
scene
when
he
have
be
there
with
her
at
his
last
visit
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
how
thing
have
change
since
then
!
<EOS>
then
he
have
love
Lady
Laura
with
all
his
heart
,
and
he
have
now
already
bring
himself
to
regard
her
as
a
discreet
matron
whom
to
love
would
be
almost
as
unreasonable
as
though
he
be
to
entertain
a
passion
for
the
Lord
Chancellor
.
<EOS>
the
reader
will
understand
how
thorough
have
be
the
cure
effect
by
Lady
Laura
's
marriage
and
the
interval
of
a
few
month
,
when
the
swain
be
already
prepared
to
make
this
lady
the
depositary
of
his
confidence
in
another
matter
of
love
.

well

very
easy

just

certainly
never

Lord

speak
a

two
which
stop
him

I
have
no

He
have
be
sharp
enough
to
perceive
already
that
Mr.

an
autocrat
in

<EOS>
the
word
that
strike
him
most
in

this

his

him

He
be
aware
that
the
circle

have
fall
into
a
way
of
miscall
him
by
his
christian
name

as
one
observe
to
be
do
now
and
again
in
reference
to
some
special
young
man

<EOS>
Most
of
the
man
whom
he
call
his

call
him
Phineas

<EOS>
even
the
Earl
have
do
so
more
than
once
on
occasion
in
which
the
greatness
of
his
position
have
drop
for
a
moment
out
of

Mrs.
Low
have
call
him
Phineas
when
she
regard
him
as
her
husband

most
cherished
pupil
;
and
Mrs.
Bunce
have
call
him
Mr.
Phineas

<EOS>
He
have
always
be
Phineas
to
everybody
at
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
but
still
he
be
quite
sure
that
Lady
Laura
have
never
so
call
him
before
.
<EOS>
nor
would
she
have
do
so
now
in
her
husband

presence

be
sure

that
also

away
from

<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do

<EOS>
though
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
come

tell
you
so

that
I

have
fall
into

hurt
myself
at

You
can
tell
no

that
be

you
do

indeed
,
what
be
it
possible
that
you
should
do
?
<EOS>
I
mean
it
as
no
rebuke
when
I
say
that
my
happiness

unhappiness
be
a

you
will
soon
become
perfectly

why
should
you
say
so

it
should

have

<EOS>
not
that
you

have
be
so

few

you

as
for
me
,
it
will
be
out
of
the
question
that

mine
to
you

how
can
you
be
my

<EOS>
"

now

<EOS>
still
he
do
not
look
at
her

lie
with
his
face
support
on
his
hand
,
and
his
eye
turn
away
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
but
she
,
where
she
be
sit
,
could
see
him
,
and
be
aid
by
her
sight
in
make
comparison
in
her
mind
between
the
two
man
who
have
be
her
lover
,
 
between
him
whom
she
have
take
and
<EOS>
him
whom
she
have
leave

<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
hard
,
dry
,
unsympathising
,
unchanging
virtue
of
her
husband
which
almost
revolt
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
a
fault
,
but
she
have
try
him
at
every
point
and
have
be
able
to
strike
no
spark
of
fire
from
him
.
<EOS>
even
by
disobey
she
could
produce
no
heat
,
 
only
an
access
of
firmness
.
<EOS>
how
would
it
have
be
with
her
have
she
throw
all
idea
of
fortune
to
the
wind
,
and
link
her
lot
to
that
of
the
young
Phoebus
who
be
lie
at
her
foot

if
she
have
ever
love
any
one
she
have
love
him
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
not
throw
away
her
love
for
money

<EOS>
so
she
swear
to
herself
over
and
over
again
,
try
to
console
herself
in
her
cold
unhappiness
.
<EOS>
She
have
marry
a
rich
man
in
order
that
she
may
be
able
to
do
something
in
the
world
;
 
and
now
that
she
be
this
rich
man
's
wife
she
find
that
she
could
do
nothing

<EOS>
the
rich
man
think
it
to

enough
for

to
sit
at
home

after

some

addition

of

Laura
back
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Kennedy
's
hat
have
first
appear
come
up
the
walk
,
Phineas
have
be
ready
to
proclaim
himself
prepare
for
any
devotion
in
the
service
of
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
begin
to
reply
with
criminal
tenderness
to
the
indiscreet
avowal
which
Lady
Laura
have
make
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
feel
now
,
after
what
have
just
occur
in
the
husband
's
presence
,
that
any
show
of
tenderness
,
 
of
criminal
tenderness
,
 
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
the
absence
of
all
suspicion
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Kennedy
have
make
Phineas
feel
that
he
be
bind
by
all
social
law
to
refrain
from
such
tenderness
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
begin
to
descend
the
path
before
him
without
a
word
;
 
and
go
on
,
and
on
,
as
though
she
would
have
reach
the
house
without
speak
,
have
he
not
address
her
.
"
<EOS>
do
your
head
still
pain
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
be
right
in
say
that
you
should
not
be
out
in
the
heat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
worth
while
to
think
about
that
.
<EOS>
He
send
me
in
,
and
so
of
course
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
and
he
tell
you
to
take
me
,
and
so
of
course
you
must
take
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
wish
that
I
should
let
you
go
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
would
.
<EOS>
only
he
will
be
sure
to
find
it
out
;
and
you
must
not
tell
him
that
you
leave
me
at
my
request
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
that
I
be
afraid
of
him
?
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
think
you
be
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
be
,
and
that
papa
be
;
and
that
his
mother
hardly
dare
to
call
her
soul
her
own
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
you
should
escape
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
be
nothing
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
something
to
me
,
and
so
I
suppose
I
have
better
go
on
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
shall
have
that
horrid
man
from
the
little
town
paw
me
and
cover
everything
with
snuff
,
and
bid
me
take
Scotch
physic
,
 
which
seem
to
increase
in
quantity
and
nastiness
as
dose
in
England
decrease
.
<EOS>
and
he
will
stand
over
me
to
see
that
I
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
;
 
the
doctor
from
Callender
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
but
Mr.
Kennedy
will
.
<EOS>
if
he
advise
me
to
have
a
hole
in
my
glove
<EOS>
mend
,
he
would
ask
me
before
he
go
to
bed
whether
it
be
do
.
<EOS>
He
never
forget
anything
in
his
life
,
and
be
never
unmindful
of
anything
.
<EOS>
that
I
think
will
do
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
You
have
bring
me
out
from
the
tree
,
and
that
may
be
take
as
bring
me
home
.
<EOS>
We
shall
hardly
get
scold
if
we
part
here
.
<EOS>
remember
what
I
tell
you
up
above
.
<EOS>
and
remember
also
that
it
be
in
your
power
to
do
nothing
else
for
me
.
<EOS>
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
he
turn
away
towards
the
lake
,
and
let
Lady
Laura
go
across
the
wide
lawn
to
the
house
by
herself
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
fail
altogether
in
his
intention
of
tell
his
friend
of
his
love
for
Violet
,
and
have
come
to
perceive
that
he
could
not
for
the
present
carry
out
that
intention
.
<EOS>
after
what
have
pass
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
go
to
Lady
Laura
with
a
passionate
tale
of
his
longing
for
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
even
to
speak
to
her
of
love
at
all
,
it
must
be
quite
of
another
love
than
that
.
<EOS>
but
he
never
would
speak
to
her
of
love
;
nor
,
 
as
he
feel
quite
sure
,
 
would
she
allow
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
what
astound
him
most
as
he
think
of
the
interview
which
have
just
pass
,
be
the
fact
that
the
Lady
Laura
whom
he
have
know
,
 
whom
he
have
think
he
have
know
,
 
should
have
become
so
subject
to
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Kennedy
,
a
man
whom
he
have
despise
as
be
weak
,
irresolute
,
and
without
a
purpose
!
<EOS>
for
the
day
or
two
that
he
remain
at
Loughlinter
,
he
watch
the
family
closely
,
and
become
aware
that
Lady
Laura
have
be
right
when
she
declare
that
her
father
be
afraid
of
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
follow
you
almost
immediately
,
"
say
the
Earl
confidentially
to
Phineas
,
when
the
candidate
for
the
borough
take
his
departure
from
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
to
be
there
just
when
the
election
be
go
on
,
but
I
will
be
at
Saulsby
to
receive
you
the
day
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
take
his
leave
from
Mr.
Kennedy
,
with
a
warm
expression
of
friendship
on
the
part
of
his
host
,
and
from
Lady
Laura
with
a
mere
touch
of
the
hand
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
say
a
word
;
but
she
be
sullen
,
or
,
if
not
,
she
put
on
some
mood
like
to
sullenness
,
and
say
never
a
word
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
day
after
the
departure
of
Phineas
Finn
for
Loughton
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
still
have
a
headache
.
<EOS>
She
have
complain
of
a
headache
ever
since
she
have
be
at
Loughlinter
,
and
Dr.
Macnuthrie
have
be
over
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
it
be
that
ail
you
,
"
say
her
husband
,
stand
over
her
in
her
own
sitting
-
room
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pretty
room
,
look
away
to
the
mountain
,
with
just
a
glimpse
of
the
lake
to
be
catch
from
the
window
,
and
it
have
be
prepare
for
her
with
all
the
skill
and
taste
of
an
accomplished
upholsterer
.
<EOS>
She
have
select
the
room
for
herself
soon
after
her
engagement
,
and
have
thank
her
future
husband
with
her
sweetest
smile
for
give
her
the
choice
.
<EOS>
She
have
thank
him
and
tell
him
that
she
always
mean
to
be
happy
,
 
so
happy
in
that
room
!
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
not
much
give
to
romance
,
but
he
think
of
this
promise
as
he
stand
over
her
and
ask
after
her
health
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
he
could
see
she
have
never
be
even
comfortable
since
she
have
be
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
a
shadow
of
the
truth
come
across
his
mind
.
<EOS>
perhaps
his
wife
be
bore
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
what
be
to
be
the
future
of
his
life
and
of
hers
?
<EOS>
He
go
up
to
London
every
year
,
and
to
Parliament
,
as
a
duty
;
and
then
,
during
some
period
of
the
recess
,
would
have
his
house
full
of
guest
,
 
as
another
duty
.
<EOS>
but
his
happiness
be
to
consist
in
such
hour
as
these
which
seem
to
inflict
upon
his
wife
the
penalty
of
a
continual
headache
.
<EOS>
a
shadow
of
the
truth
come
upon
him
.
<EOS>
what
if
his
wife
do
not
like
live
quietly
at
home
as
the
mistress
of
her
husband
's
house
?
<EOS>
what
if
a
headache
be
always
to
be
the
result
of
a
simple
performance
of
domestic
duty
?
  
<EOS>
More
than
a
shadow
of
truth
have
come
upon
Lady
Laura
herself
.
<EOS>
the
dark
cloud
create
by
the
entire
truth
be
upon
her
,
make
everything
black
and
wretche
around
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
ask
herself
a
question
or
two
,
and
have
discover
that
she
have
no
love
for
her
husband
,
that
the
kind
of
life
which
he
intend
to
exact
from
her
be
insupportable
to
her
,
and
that
she
have
blunder
and
fall
in
her
entrance
upon
life
.
<EOS>
She
perceive
that
her
father
have
already
become
weary
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
that
,
lonely
and
sad
as
he
would
be
at
Saulsby
by
himself
,
it
be
his
intention
to
repudiate
the
idea
of
make
a
home
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
yes
;
 
she
would
be
desert
by
everyone
,
except
of
course
by
her
husband
;
and
then---
<EOS>
then
she
would
throw
herself
on
some
early
morning
into
the
lake
,
for
life
would
be
insupportable
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
it
be
that
ail
you
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
serious

<EOS>
one
can
not
always
help
have
a
headache

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
take
enough
exercise

Laura

I
would
propose

you

walk
four
mile
every
day
after
breakfast

I
will
always
be
ready
to
accompany
you

I

You
be
unreasonable

I

Mr.
Slide
's
Grievance
 
<EOS>
Our
hero
be
elect
member
for
Loughton
without
any
trouble
to
him
or
,
as
far
as
he
could
see
,
to
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
He
make
one
speech
from
a
small
raise
booth
that
be
call
a
platform
,
and
that
be
all
that
he
be
call
upon
to
do
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grating
make
a
speech
in
propose
him
,
and
Mr.
Shortribs
another
in
second
him
;
and
these
be
all
the
speech
that
be
require
.
<EOS>
the
thing
seem
to
be
so
very
easy
that
he
be
afterwards
almost
offend
when
he
be
tell
that
the
bill
for
so
insignificant
a
piece
of
work
come
to
£
247
13
.
<EOS>
9d
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
no
occasion
for
spend
even
the
odd
forty
-
seven
pound
.
<EOS>
but
then
he
be
member
for
Loughton
;
and
as
he
pass
the
evening
alone
at
the
inn
,
have
dine
in
company
with
Messrs.
Grating
,
Shortribs
,
and
sundry
other
influential
elector
,
he
begin
to
reflect
that
,
after
all
,
it
be
not
so
very
great
a
thing
to
be
a
member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
It
almost
seem
that
that
which
have
come
to
him
so
easily
could
not
be
of
much
value
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
day
he
go
to
the
castle
,
and
be
there
when
the
Earl
arrive
.
<EOS>
They
two
be
alone
together
,
and
the
Earl
be
very
kind
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
so
you
have
no
opponent
after
all
,
"
say
the
great
man
of
Loughton
,
with
a
slight
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
the
ghost
of
another
candidate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
there
would
be
.
<EOS>
They
have
try
it
once
or
twice
and
have
always
fail
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
or
two
in
the
place
who
like
to
go
one
way
just
because
their
neighbour
go
the
other
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
there
be
no
conservative
feeling
in
the
place
!
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
although
he
be
at
the
present
moment
the
member
for
Loughton
himself
,
could
not
but
enjoy
the
joke
of
this
.
<EOS>
Could
there
be
any
liberal
feeling
in
such
a
place
,
or
,
indeed
,
any
political
feeling
whatsoever
?
<EOS>
Would
not
Messrs.
Grating
and
Shortribs
have
do
just
the
same
<EOS>
have
it
happen
that
Lord
Brentford
have
be
a
Tory
peer
?
<EOS>
"
They
all
seem
to
be
very
obliging
,
"
say
Phineas
,
in
answer
to
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
be
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
house
in
the
town
,
you
know
,
let
for
long
than
seven
year
,
and
most
of
them
merely
from
year
to
year
.
<EOS>
and
,
do
you
know
,
I
have
not
a
farmer
on
the
property
with
a
lease
,
 
not
one
;
and
they
do
not
want
lease
.
<EOS>
They
know
they
be
safe
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
like
the
people
round
me
to
be
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
as
myself
about
politic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
second
day
after
dinner
,
 
the
last
evening
of
Finn
's
visit
to
Saulsby
,
 
the
Earl
fall
suddenly
into
a
confidential
conversation
about
his
daughter
and
his
son
,
and
about
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
so
sudden
,
indeed
,
and
so
confidential
be
the
conversation
,
that
Phineas
be
almost
silence
for
awhile
.
<EOS>
a
word
or
two
have
be
say
about
Loughlinter
,
of
the
beauty
of
the
place
and
of
the
vastness
of
the
property
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
almost
afraid
,
"
say
Lord
Brentford
,
"
that
Laura
be
not
happy
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
be
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
so
hard
and
dry
,
and
what
I
call
exact
.
<EOS>
that
be
just
the
word
for
it
.
<EOS>
now
Laura
have
never
be
use
to
that
.
<EOS>
with
me
she
always
have
her
own
way
in
everything
,
and
I
always
find
her
fit
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
why
her
husband
should
treat
her
differently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
the
temper
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Temper
,
yes
;
but
what
a
bad
prospect
be
that
for
her
!
<EOS>
and
she
,
too
,
have
a
temper
,
and
so
he
will
find
if
he
try
her
too
far
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
stand
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
I
tell
Laura
so
fairly
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
house
in
which
a
man
can
not
call
his
hour
his
own
.
<EOS>
I
tell
Laura
that
I
could
not
undertake
to
remain
there
for
above
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
sad
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
;
it
be
sad
for
her
,
poor
girl
;
and
very
sad
for
me
too
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
one
else
<EOS>
but
Laura
,
 
literally
no
one
;
and
now
I
be
divide
from
her
!
<EOS>
It
seem
that
she
have
be
take
as
much
away
from
me
as
though
her
husband
live
in
China
.
<EOS>
I
have
lose
them
both
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
I
have
.
<EOS>
as
to
Chiltern
,
I
can
perceive
that
he
become
more
and
more
indifferent
to
me
every
day
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
me
only
as
a
man
in
his
way
who
must
die
some
day
and
may
die
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wrong
him
,
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wrong
him
at
all

<EOS>
why
have
he
answer
every
offer
I
have
make
him
with
so
much
insolence
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
put
myself
into
further
communion
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
think
that
you
have
wrong
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
because
I
have
be
unable
to
shut
my
eye
to
his
mode
of
living
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
go
on
pay
his
debt
,
and
take
no
other
notice
whatsoever
of
his
conduct
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
be
in
debt
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
because
his
sister
the
other
day
spend
every
shilling
of
her
fortune
in
pay
them
.
<EOS>
She
give
him
£
40,000
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
she
would
have
marry
Kennedy
but
for
that
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
prevent
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
I
would
not
cripple
my
remain
year
of
life
by
raise
the
money
,

I
could
not
go
back
from
my
word

"
You
and
Chiltern
may
raise
the
money
between
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
do
no
good
now
.
<EOS>
She
have
marry
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
the
money
be
nothing
to
her
or
to
him
.
<EOS>
Chiltern
may
have
put
thing
right
by
marry
Miss
Effingham
if
he
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
do
his
good
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
he
do
his
bad
.
<EOS>
He
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
as
a
man
ask
for
a
railway
-
ticket
or
a
pair
of
glove
,
which
he
buy
with
a
price
;
and
because
she
would
not
jump
into
his
mouth
he
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
he
even
really
want
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
have
some
disreputable
connection
to
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
He
would
marry
her
to
-
morrow
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
My
belief
be
that
Miss
Effingham
be
sincere
in
refuse
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
her
sincerity
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
that
she
will
never
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
well
;
I
do
not
agree
with
you
,
and
I
daresay
I
know
them
both
better
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
but
everything
go
against
me

<EOS>
I
have
set
my
heart
upon
it
,
and
therefore
of
course
I
shall
be
disappoint

<EOS>
what
be
he
go
to
do
this
autumn
?

<EOS>
"
He
be
yacht
now

<EOS>
"
and
who
be
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>

I
think
the
boat
belong
to
Captain
Colepepper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
great
blackguard
in
all
England
!
<EOS>
a
man
who
shoot
pigeon
and
ride
steeple
-
chase
!
<EOS>
and
the
bad
of
Chiltern
be
this
,
that
even
if
he
do
not
like
the
man
,
and
if
he
be
tired
of
this
sort
of
life
,
he
would
go
on
just
the
same
because
he
think
it
a
fine
thing
not
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
so
true
that
Phineas
do
not
dare
to
contradict
the
statement
,
and
therefore
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
faint
hope
,
"
continue
the
Earl
,
"
while
Laura
could
always
watch
him
;
because
,
in
his
way
,
he
be
fond
of
his
sister
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
She
will
have
enough
to
do
to
watch
herself
!
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
have
feel
that
the
Earl
have
put
him
down
rather
sharply
when
he
have
say
that
Violet
would
never
accept
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
he
be
therefore
not
a
little
surprised
when
Lord
Brentford
speak
again
of
Miss
Effingham
the
follow
morning
,
hold
in
his
hand
a
letter
which
he
have
just
receive
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
to
be
at
Loughlinter
on
the
tenth
,

he
say
,
"
and
she
purpose
to
come
here
for
a
couple
of
night
on
her
way
.

<EOS>
"
Lady
Baldock

all

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
yes
;
Lady
Baldock
and
all

I
be
not
very
fond
of
Lady
Baldock
,
but
I
will
put
up
with
her
for
a
couple
of
day
for
the
sake
of
have
Violet
.
<EOS>
She
be
more
like
a
child
of
my
own
now
than
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
see
her
all
the
autumn
afterwards

I
can
not
stand
Loughlinter

It
will
be
well

the
house
be
full

will

there

well

no

enough
of
it

you

Phineas
make
no

smile
slightly

"
by
Jove

I
do

have
give
all
he
have
in

country
house

could
not

come

oblige

absent

shall
go
over
to
Ireland

have
a

hard
reading
to
do

get
through
it
there
without
interruption

<EOS>
He
go
up
from
Saulsby
to
London
on
that
day
,
and
find
himself
quite
alone
in
Mrs.
Bunce
's
lodging
.
<EOS>
I
mean
not
only
that
he
be
alone
at
his
lodging
,
but
he
be
alone
at
his
club
,
and
alone
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
July
be
not
quite
over
,
and
yet
all
the
bird
of
passage
have
migrate
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
by
his
short
session
,
have
half
ruin
the
London
tradesman
,
and
have
change
the
summer
mode
of
life
of
all
those
who
account
themselves
to
be
anybody
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
sit
alone
in
his
room
,
feel
himself
to
be
nobody
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
the
Earl
that
he
be
go
to
Ireland
,
and
to
Ireland
he
must
go
;
 
because
he
have
nothing
else
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
ask
indeed
to
join
one
or
two
party
in
their
autumn
plan
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
have
want
him
to
go
to
the
Pyrenees
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
have
suggest
that
he
should
join
the
yacht
;
 
but
neither
plan
suit
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
suit
him
to
be
at
Loughlinter
with
Violet
Effingham
,
but
Loughlinter
be
a
bar
house
to
him
.
<EOS>
His
old
friend
,
Lady
Laura
,
have
tell
him
not
to
come
thither
,
explain
,
with
sufficient
clearness
,
her
reason
for
exclude
him
from
the
number
of
her
husband
's
guest
.
<EOS>
as
he
think
of
it
the
past
scene
of
his
life
become
very
marvellous
to
him
.
<EOS>
twelve
month
since
he
would
have
give
all
the
world
for
a
word
of
love
from
Lady
Laura
,
and
have
barely
dare
to
hope
that
such
a
word
,
at
some
future
day
,
may
possibly
be
speak
.
<EOS>
now
such
a
word
have
in
truth
be
speak
,
and
it
have
come
to
be
simply
a
trouble
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
own
to
him
,
 
for
,
in
truth
,
such
have
be
the
meaning
of
her
warning
to
him
,
 
that
,
though
she
have
marry
another
man
,
she
have
love
and
do
love
him
.
<EOS>
but
in
thinking
of
this
he
take
no
pride
in
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
he
have
think
of
it
long
that
he
begin
to
ask
himself
whether
he
may
not
be
justify
in
gathering
from
what
happen
some
hope
that
Violet
also
may
learn
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
so
little
of
himself
as
to
have
be
afraid
at
first
to
press
his
suit
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
may
he
not
venture
to
think
more
of
himself
,
have
learn
how
far
he
have
succeed
?
  
<EOS>
but
how
be
he
to
get
at
Violet
Effingham
?
<EOS>
from
the
moment
at
which
he
have
leave
Saulsby
he
have
be
angry
with
himself
for
not
have
ask
Lord
Brentford
to
allow
him
to
remain
there
till
after
the
Baldock
party
should
have
go
on
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
,
who
be
very
lonely
in
his
house
,
would
have
consent
at
once
.
<EOS>
phinea
,
indeed
,
be
drive
to
confess
to
himself
<EOS>
that
success
with
Violet
would
at
once
have
put
an
end
to
all
his
friendship
with
Lord
Brentford
;
 
as
also
to
all
his
friendship
with
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
He
would
,
in
such
case
,
be
bind
in
honour
to
vacate
his
seat
and
give
back
Loughton
to
his
offend
patron
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
have
give
up
much
more
than
his
seat
for
Violet
Effingham
!
<EOS>
at
present
,
however
,
he
have
no
means
of
get
at
her
to
ask
her
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
go
to
Loughlinter
in
opposition
to
the
wish
of
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
adventure
happen
to
him
in
London
which
somewhat
relieve
the
dulness
of
the
day
of
the
first
week
in
August
.
<EOS>
He
remain
in
London
till
the
middle
of
August
,
half
resolve
to
rush
down
to
Saulsby
when
Violet
Effingham
should
be
there
,
 
endeavour
to
find
some
excuse
for
such
a
proceeding
,
but
rack
his
brain
in
vain
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
there
come
about
his
little
adventure
.
<EOS>
the
adventure
be
commence
by
the
receipt
of
the
following
letter
:
    
Banner
of
the
People
Office
,
3rd
August
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
finn
,
  
<EOS>
I
must
say
I
think
you
have
treat
me
badly
,
and
without
that
sort
of
brotherly
fairness
which
we
on
the
public
press
expect
from
one
another
.
<EOS>
however
,
perhaps
we
can
come
to
an
understanding
,
and
if
so
,
thing
may
yet
go
smoothly
.
<EOS>
give
me
a
turn
<EOS>
and
I
be
not
at
all
adverse
to
give
you
one
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
to
me
here
,
or
shall
I
call
upon
you
?
  
<EOS>
Yours
always
,
Q.
S.
  
Phineas
be
not
only
surprised
,
but
disgust
also
,
at
the
receipt
of
this
letter
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
imagine
what
be
the
deed
by
which
he
have
offend
Mr.
Slide
.
<EOS>
He
think
over
all
the
circumstance
of
his
short
connection
with
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
but
could
remember
nothing
which
may
have
create
offence
.
<EOS>
but
his
disgust
be
great
than
his
surprise
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
he
have
do
nothing
and
say
nothing
to
justify
Quintus
Slide
in
call
him
"
dear
Finn
.
"
<EOS>
He
,
who
have
Lady
Laura
's
secret
in
his
keeping
;
he
who
hope
to
be
the
possessor
of
Violet
Effingham
's
affection
,
 
he
to
be
call
"
dear
Finn
"
by
such
a
one
as
Quintus
Slide
!
<EOS>
He
soon
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
answer
the
note
,
but
would
go
at
once
to
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
office
at
the
hour
at
which
Quintus
Slide
be
always
there
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
would
not
write
to
"
dear
slide
;
"
and
,
until
he
have
hear
something
more
of
this
cause
of
offence
,
he
would
not
make
an
enemy
for
ever
by
call
the
man
"
dear
Sir
.
"
<EOS>
He
go
to
the
office
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
and
find
Mr.
Slide
ensconce
in
a
little
glass
cupboard
,
write
an
article
for
the
next
day
's
copy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
be
very
busy
,
"
say
Phineas
,
insert
himself
with
some
difficulty
on
to
a
little
stool
in
the
corner
of
the
cupboard
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
so
particular
but
<EOS>
what
I
be
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
You
shoot
,
do
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
shoot
!
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
possible
that
Mr.
Slide
be
intend
,
after
this
abrupt
fashion
,
to
propose
a
duel
with
pistol
.
  
<EOS>
"
grouse
and
pheasant
,
and
them
sort
of
thing
?
"
ask
Mr.
Slide
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
ah
;
I
understand
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
shoot
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
the
12th
or
20th
for
grouse
in
Scotland
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
the
12th
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
what
make
you
ask
that
just
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
do
a
letter
about
it
,
 
advise
man
not
to
shoot
too
many
of
the
young
bird
,
and
show
that
they
will
have
none
next
year
if
they
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
fellow
here
just
now
who
know
all
about
it
,
and
he
put
down
a
lot
;
but
I
forgot
to
make
him
tell
me
the
day
of
beginning
.
<EOS>
what
be
a
good
place
to
date
from
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
suggest
Callender
or
Stirling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stirling
be
too
much
of
a
town
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
Callender
sound
well
for
game
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
the
letter
which
be
to
save
the
young
grouse
be
date
from
Callender
;
and
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
have
write
the
word
,
throw
down
his
pen
,
come
off
his
stool
,
and
rush
at
once
at
his
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
now
,
Finn
,
"
he
say
,
"
do
not
you
know
that
you
have
treat
me
badly
about
Loughton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
treat
you
badly
about
Loughton
!
"
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
repeat
the
word
,
be
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
Mr.
Slide
's
meaning
.
<EOS>
do
Mr.
Slide
intend
to
convey
a
reproach
because
Phineas
have
not
personally
send
some
tiding
of
the
election
to
the
_
People

Banner
_
?
  
<EOS>
"
very
badly
,
"
say
Mr.
Slide
,
with
his
arm
akimbo
,
 
"
very
badly
indeed
!
<EOS>
man
on
the
press
together
do
expect
that
they
be
to
be
stick
by
,
and
not
throw
over
.
<EOS>
damn
it
,
I
say
;
what
be
the
good
of
a
brotherhood
if
it
be
not

<EOS>

how
on

me
over
most
shabby

I
will
not

<EOS>
You
shall
have
Loughton
this
session
if
you
will
promise
to
make
way
for
me
after
the
next
election

<EOS>
if
you
will
agree
to
that
,
we
will
have
a
special
leader
to
say
how
well
Lord
What's
-
his

name
have
do
with
the

horgan
through

<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
such
nonsense
in
my
life

<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
Loughton
be
safe
to
be
in
the
schedule
of
reduce
borough
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
throw
into
the
county
,
or
join
with
a
group

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
stand
the
chance

<EOS>
Will
you
agree

agree

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
It
be
the
most
absurd
proposal

You
may
as
well
ask
me
whether
I
would
agree
that
you
should
go
to
heaven
.
<EOS>
go
to
heaven
if
you
can
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
slight
objection
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
nothing
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
Quintus
Slide
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
well
!
<EOS>
now
we
understand
each
other
,
and
that
be
all
that
I
desire
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
I
can
show
you
what
it
be
to
come
among
gentleman
of
the
press
,
and
then
to
throw
them
over
.
<EOS>
good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
Phineas
,
quite
satisfied
at
the
result
of
the
interview
as
regard
himself
,
and
by
no
mean
sorry
that
there
should
have
arise
a
cause
of
separation
between
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
and
his
"
dear
Finn
,
"
shake
off
a
little
dust
from
his
foot
as
he
leave
the
office
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
and
resolve
that
in
future
he
would
attempt
to
make
no
connection
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
as
he
return
home
he
tell
himself
that
a
member
of
Parliament
should
be
altogether
independent
of
the
press
.
<EOS>
on
the
second
morning
after
his
meeting
with
his
late
friend
,
he
see
the
result
of
his
independence
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
startling
article
,
a
tremendous
article
,
show
the
press
necessity
of
immediate
reform
,
and
prove
the
necessity
by
an
illustration
of
the
borough
-
monger
rottenness
of
the
present
system
.
<EOS>
when
such
a
patron
as
Lord
Brentford
,
 
himself
a
Cabinet
Minister
with
a
sinecure
,
 
could
by
his
mere
word
put
into
the
House
such
a
stick
as
Phineas
Finn
,
 
a
man
who
have
struggle
to
stand
on
his
leg
before
the
Speaker
,
but
have
want
both
the
courage
and
the
capacity
,
nothing
further
could
surely
be
want
to
prove
that
the
Reform
Bill
of
1832
require
to
be
supplement
by
some
more
energetic
measure
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
laugh
as
he
read
the
article
,
and
declare
to
himself
that
the
joke
be
a
good
joke
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
suffer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
,
when
he
be
really
anxious
to
use
his
thong
earnestly
,
could
generally
raise
a
wale
.
   
<EOS>
be
He
honest
?
 
<EOS>
on
the
10th
of
August
,
Phineas
Finn
do
return
to
Loughton
.
<EOS>
He
go
down
by
the
mail
train
on
the
night
of
the
10th
,
have
telegraph
to
the
inn
for
a
bed
,
and
be
up
eat
his
breakfast
in
that
hospitable
house
at
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
and
landlady
with
all
their
staff
be
at
a
loss
to
imagine
what
have
bring
down
their
member
again
so
quickly
to
his
borough
;
but
the
reader
,
who
will
remember
that
Lady
Baldock
with
her
daughter
and
Violet
Effingham
be
to
pass
the
11th
of
the
month
at
Saulsby
,
may
perhaps
be
able
to
make
a
guess
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
have
be
think
of
make
this
sudden
visit
to
Loughton
ever
since
he
have
be
up
in
town
,
but
he
could
suggest
to
himself
no
reason
to
be
give
to
Lord
Brentford
for
his
sudden
reappearance
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
have
be
very
kind
to
him
,
but
he
have
say
nothing
which
could
justify
his
young
friend
in
run
in
and
out
of
Saulsby
Castle
at
pleasure
,
without
invitation
and
without
notice
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
so
well
aware
of
this
himself
that
often
as
he
have
half
resolve
during
the
last
ten
day
to
return
to
Saulsby
,
so
often
have
he
determine
that
he
could
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
could
think
of
no
excuse
.
<EOS>
then
the
heavens
favour
him
,
and
he
receive
a
letter
from
Lord
Chiltern
,
in
which
there
be
a
message
for
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
see
my
father
,
tell
him
that
I
be
ready
at
any
moment
to
do
what
be
necessary
for
raise
the
money
for
Laura
.
"
<EOS>
take
this
as
his
excuse
he
return
to
Loughton
.
  
<EOS>
as
chance
arrange
it
,
he
meet
the
Earl
stand
on
the
great
step
before
his
own
castle
door
.
<EOS>
"
what
,
Finn
;
be
this
you
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
be
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
yet
,
my
lord
,
as
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
open
his
budget
at
once
,
and
blush
at
his
own
hypocrisy
as
he
go
on
with
his
story
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
he
say
,
feel
the
message
from
Chiltern
to
be
so
all
-
important
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
go
over
to
Ireland
without
deliver
it
.
<EOS>
He
urge
upon
the
Earl
that
he
may
learn
from
this
how
anxious
Lord
Chiltern
be
to
effect
a
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
when
it
occur
to
him
,
he
say
,
that
there
may
be
a
hope
of
do
anything
towards
such
an
object
,
he
could
not
go
to
Ireland
leave
the
good
work
behind
him
.
<EOS>
in
love
and
war
all
thing
be
fair
.
<EOS>
so
he
declare
to
himself
;
but
as
he
do
so
he
feel
that
his
story
be
so
weak
that
it
would
hardly
gain
for
him
an
admittance
into
the
Castle
.
<EOS>
in
this
he
be
completely
wrong
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
,
swallow
the
bait
,
put
his
arm
through
that
of
the
intruder
,
and
,
walk
with
him
through
the
path
of
the
shrubbery
,
at
length
confess
that
he
would
be
glad
to
be
reconcile
to
his
son
if
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
"
let
him
come
here
,
and
she
shall
be
here
also
,
"
say
the
Earl
,
speak
of
Violet
.
<EOS>
to
this
Phineas
could
say
nothing
out
loud
,
but
he
tell
himself
that
all
should
be
fair
between
them
.
<EOS>
He
would
take
no
dishonest
advantage
of
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
He
would
give
Lord
Chiltern
the
whole
message
as
it
be
give
to
him
by
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
but
should
it
so
turn
out
that
he
himself
get
an
opportunity
of
say
to
violet
all
that
he
have
come
to
say
,
and
should
it
also
turn
out
,
 
an
event
which
he
acknowledge
to
himself
to
be
most
unlikely
,
 
that
Violet
do
not
reject
him
,
then
how
could
he
write
his
letter
to
Lord
Chiltern
?
<EOS>
so
he
resolve
that
the
letter
should
be
write
before
he
see
Violet
.
<EOS>
but
how
could
he
write
such
a
letter
and
instantly
afterwards
do
that
which
would
be
false
to
the
spirit
of
a
letter
so
write
?
<EOS>
Could
he
bid
Lord
Chiltern
come
home
to
woo
Violet
Effingham
,
and
instantly
go
forth
to
woo
her
for
himself
?
<EOS>
He
find
that
he
could
not
do
so
,
 
unless
he
tell
the
whole
truth
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
in
no
other
way
could
he
carry
out
his
project
and
satisfy
his
own
idea
of
what

honest

<EOS>
the
Earl
bade
him
send

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the

"
<EOS>
then
Phineas
declare
that
he
also
must
return
to
London
very
early
on
the
morrow
;
 
but
in
the
meantime
he
would
go
to
the
inn
and
fetch
his
thing
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
thank
him
again
and
again
for

and
Phineas
,
blush
as
he
receive
the
thank

<EOS>
It

portion
of

with
word

<EOS>
and
everything
be

about
Miss

that
could

should
have

<EOS>
then
,
on
the
last
page

he
tell
his
own
story
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
must
speak
of
myself
:
"
 
and
he
go
on
to
explain
to
his
friend
,
in
the
plain
language
that
he
could
use
,
his
own
position
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
love

,
"
he
say
,
"
for
six
month
,
and
I
be
here
with
the
express
intention
of

her
to
take
me

<EOS>
the
chance
be
ten
to
one
that
she
refuse
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
deprecate
your
anger

if
you
choose
to
be
angry

<EOS>
but
I
be
endeavour
to
treat
you
well
,
and
I
ask
you
to
do
the
same

<EOS>
I
must
convey
to
you
your
father
's
message
,
and
after
do
so
I
can
not
address
myself
to
Miss
Effingham
without

<EOS>
I
should
feel
myself
to
be
false
<EOS>
be
I
to
do
so

<EOS>
in
the
event

the
probable

nay

almost
certain

I
shall
trust
you

<EOS>
do
not
quarrel
with
me
if
you
can
help
it
;

if
you
must
I
will
be
ready

"
<EOS>
then
he
post
the
letter
and
go
up
to
the
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
only
the
one
day
for
his
action

and
he

<EOS>
He

to
a
certain
degree
,
a
favourite

and
be

deeply
engage
in
a
conversation
as
to
the
practicability
of
shut
up
all
the
brewery
and
distillery
by
Act
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
but
lunch
relieve
him
,
and
bring
the
young
lady
in
at
two
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
seem
to
be
really
glad
to
see
him
,
and
even
Miss
Boreham
,
Lady
Baldock
's
daughter
,
be
very
gracious
to
him
.
<EOS>
for
the
Earl
have
be
speak
well
of
his
young
member
,
and
Phineas
have
in
a
way
grow
into
the
good
grace
of
sober
and
discreet
people
.
<EOS>
after
lunch
they
be
to
ride
;
 
the
Earl
,
that
is
,
and
Violet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
and
her
daughter
be
to
have
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
mount
you
,
Finn
,
if
you
would
like
it
,
"
say
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
he
will
like
it
,
"
say
Violet
;
"
do
you
suppose
Mr.
Finn
will
object
to
ride
with
me
in
Saulsby
Woods
?
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
the
first
time
,
will
it
?
"
<EOS>
"
Violet
,
"
say
Lady
Baldock
,
"
you
have
the
most
singular
way
of
talk
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
have
,
"
say
Violet
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
think
I
can
change
it
now
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
know
me
too
well
to
mind
it
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
past
five
before
they
be
on
horseback
,
and
up
to
that
time
Phineas
have
not
find
himself
alone
with
Violet
Effingham
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
They
have
sit
together
after
lunch
in
the
dining
-
room
for
nearly
an
hour
,
and
have
saunter
into
the
hall
and
knock
about
the
billiard
ball
,
and
then
stand
together
at
the
open
door
of
a
conservatory
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Baldock
or
Miss
Boreham
have
always
be
there
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
pleasant
than
Miss
Effingham
's
word
,
or
more
familiar
than
her
manner
to
Phineas
.
<EOS>
She
have
express
strong
delight
at
his
success
in
get
a
seat
in
Parliament
,
and
have
talk
to
him
about
the
Kennedys
as
though
they
have
create
some
special
bond
of
union
between
her
and
Phineas
which
ought
to
make
them
intimate
.
<EOS>
but
,
for
all
that
,
she
could
not
be
get
to
separate
herself
from
Lady
Baldock
;
 
and
when
she
be
tell
that
if
she
mean
to
ride
she
must
go
and
dress
herself
,
she
go
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
think
that
he
may
have
a
chance
on
horseback
;
and
after
they
have
be
out
about
half
an
hour
,
chance
do
favour
him
.
<EOS>
for
awhile
he
ride
behind
with
the
carriage
,
calculate
that
by
his
so
do
the
Earl
would
be
put
off
his
guard
,
and
would
be
dispose
after
awhile
to
change
place
with
him
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
fall
out
.
<EOS>
at
a
certain
fall
of
ground
in
the
park
,
where
the
road
turn
round
and
cross
a
bridge
over
the
little
river
,
the
carriage
come
up
with
the
first
two
horse
,
and
Lady
Baldock
speak
a
word
to
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
then
Violet
pull
up
,
allow
the
vehicle
to
pass
the
bridge
first
,
and
in
this
way
she
and
Phineas
be
bring
together
,
 
and
in
this
way
they
ride
on
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
aware
that
he
must
greatly
increase
the
distance
between
them
and
the
other
of
their
party
before
he
could
dare
to
plead
his
suit
,
and
even
be
that
do
<EOS>
he
feel
that
he
would
not
know
how
to
plead
it
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
go
on
some
half
mile
in
this
way
when
they
reach
a
spot
on
which
a
green
ride
lead
away
from
the
main
road
through
the
tree
to
the
left
.
<EOS>
"
You
remember
this
place
,
do
you
not
?
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
Phineas
declare
that
he
remember
it
well
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
round
by
the
woodman
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
mind
come
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
say
that
he
would
not
mind
,
and
trot
on
to
tell
them
in
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
she
go
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Lady
Baldock
;
and
then
,
when
Phineas
explain
,
she
beg
the
Earl
to
go
back
to
Violet
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
,
feel
the
absurdity
of
this
,
declare
that
Violet
know
her
way
very
well
herself
,
and
thus
Phineas
get
his
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
They
ride
on
almost
without
speak
for
nearly
a
mile
,
canter
through
the
tree
,
and
then
they
take
another
turn
to
the
right
,
and
come
upon
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
They
ride
to
the
door
,
and
speak
a
word
or
two
to
the
woman
there
,
and
then
pass
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
come
here
when
I
be
at
Saulsby
,
"
say
Violet
,
"
that
I
may
teach
myself
to
think
kindly
of
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
it
all
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
use
to
be
so
nice
;
 
and
be
so
still
,
I
believe
,
only
that
he
have
teach
himself
to
be
so
rough
.
<EOS>
Will
he
ever
change
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
know
that
in
this
emergency
it
be
his
especial
duty
to
be
honest
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
would
be
change
altogether
if
we
could
bring
him
here
,
 
so
that
he
should
live
among
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
he
would
?
<EOS>
We
must
put
our
head
together
,
and
do
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
that
it
be
to
be
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
reply
that
he
think
it
be
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
at
once
,
Miss
Effingham
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
do
it
by
a
single
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
 
yes
;
"
she
say
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
mean
that
;
 
without
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
absurd
,
you
know
,
that
a
father
should
make
such
a
condition
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
say
that
he
think
it
be
absurd
;
and
then
they
ride
on
again
,
canter
through
the
wood
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
bold
to
speak
to
her
about
Lord
Chiltern
as
he
have
do
,
and
she
have
answer
just
as
he
would
have
wish
to
be
answer
.
<EOS>
but
how
could
he
press
his
suit
for
himself
while
she
be
canter
by
his
side
?
  
<EOS>
presently
they
come
to
rough
ground
over
which
they
be
force
to
walk
,
and
he
be
close
by
her
side
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
wonder
whether
I
may
ask
a
question
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
any
question
,
"
he
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
any
quarrel
between
you
and
Lady
Laura
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
none
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
or
between
you
and
him
?
"
  
"
no
;
 
none
.
<EOS>
We
be
great
ally
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
be
you
not
go
to
be
at
Loughlinter
?
<EOS>
She
have
write
to
me
expressly
say
you
would
not
be
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
a
moment
before
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
It
do
not
suit
,
"
he
say
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
secret
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
it
be
a
secret
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
angry
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
angry
;
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
a
secret
of
my
own
,
or
I
should
not
keep
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
can
guess
it
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
not
try
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
even
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
cause
,
whatever
it
be
,
have
be
full
of
sorrow
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
give
my
left
hand
to
have
be
at
Loughlinter
this
autumn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
so
fond
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
be
stay
there
with
you
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
He
pause
,
and
for
a
moment
there
be
no
word
speak
by
either
of
them
;
but
he
could
perceive
that
the
hand
in
which
she
hold
her
whip
be
play
with
her
horse
's
mane
with
a
nervous
movement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
when
I
find
how
it
must
be
,
and
that
I
must
miss
you
,
I
rush
down
here
that
I
may
see
you
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
here
<EOS>
I
do
not
dare
to
speak
to
you
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
now
beyond
the
rock
,
and
Violet
,
without
speak
a
word
,
again
put
her
horse
into
a
trot
.
<EOS>
He
be
by
her
side
in
a
moment
,
but
he
could
not
see
her
face
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
not
a
word
to
say
to
me
?
"
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
no
;
 
no
<EOS>
;
"
she
reply
,
"
not
a
word
when
you
speak
to
me
like
that
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
come
;
 
we
will
join
them
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
canter
on
,
and
he
follow
her
till
they
reach
the
Earl
and
Lady
Baldock
and
Miss
Boreham
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
my
devotion
now
,
"
say
Miss
Effingham
,
"
and
be
ready
to
return
to
ordinary
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
could
not
find
another
moment
in
which
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
though
he
spend
the
evening
with
her
,
and
stand
over
her
as
she
sing
at
the
Earl
's
request
,
and
press
her
hand
as
she
go
to
bed
,
and
be
up
to
see
her
start
in
the
morning
,
he
could
not
draw
from
her
either
a
word
or
a
look
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
upon
reform
 
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
go
to
Ireland
immediately
after
his
return
from
Saulsby
,
have
say
nothing
further
to
Violet
Effingham
,
and
have
hear
nothing
further
from
her
than
what
be
record
in
the
last
chapter
.
<EOS>
He
feel
very
keenly
that
his
position
be
unsatisfactory
,
and
brood
over
it
all
the
autumn
and
early
winter
;
but
he
could
form
no
plan
for
improve
it
.
<EOS>
a
dozen
time
he
think
of
write
to
Miss
Effingham
,
and
ask
for
an
explicit
answer
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
however
,
bring
himself
to
write
the
letter
,
think
that
write
expression
of
love
be
always
weak
and
vapid
,
 
and
deter
also
by
a
conviction
that
Violet
,
if
drive
to
reply
in
writing
,
would
undoubtedly
reply
by
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
fifty
time
he
ride
again
in
his
imagination
his
ride
in
Saulsby
Wood
,
and
he
tell
himself
as
often
that
the
syren
's
answer
to
him
,
 
her
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
no
,
 
have
be
,
of
all
possible
answer
,
the
most
indefinite
and
provoking
.
<EOS>
the
tone
of
her
voice
as
she
gallop
away
from
him
,
the
bearing
of
her
countenance
when
he
rejoin
her
,
her
manner
to
him
when
he
see
her
start
from
the
Castle
in
the
morning
,
all
forbid
him
to
believe
that
his
word
to
her
have
be
take
as
an
offence
.
<EOS>
She
have
reply
to
him
with
a
direct
negative
,
simply
with
the
word
"
no
;
"
but
she
have
so
say
it
that
there
have
hardly
be
any
sting
in
the
no
;
and
he
have
know
at
the
moment
that
whatever
may
be
the
result
of
his
suit
,
he
nee
not
regard
Violet
Effingham
as
his
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
doubt
make
his
sojourn
in
Ireland
very
wearisome
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
other
matter
which
tend
also
to
his
discomfort
,
though
he
be
not
leave
even
at
this
period
of
his
life
without
a
continuation
of
success
which
seem
to
be
very
wonderful
.
<EOS>
and
,
first
,
I
will
say
a
word
of
his
discomfort
.
<EOS>
He
hear
not
a
line
from
Lord
Chiltern
in
answer
to
the
letter
which
he
have
write
to
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
from
Lady
Laura
he
do
hear
frequently
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
write
to
him
exactly
as
though
she
have
never
warn
him
away
from
Loughlinter
,
and
as
though
there
have
be
no
occasion
for
such
warning
.
<EOS>
She
send
him
letter
fill
chiefly
with
politic
,
say
something
also
of
the
guest
at
Loughlinter
,
something
of
the
game
,
and
just
a
word
or
two
here
<EOS>
and
there
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
the
letter
be
very
good
letter
,
and
he
preserve
them
carefully
.
<EOS>
It
be
manifest
to
him
that
they
be
intend
to
be
good
letter
,
and
,
as
such
,
to
be
preserve
.
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
,
which
he
receive
about
the
end
of
November
,
she
tell
him
that
her
brother
be
again
in
his
old
haunt
,
at
the
Willingford
Bull
,
and
that
he
have
send
to
Portman
Square
for
all
property
of
his
own
that
have
be
leave
there
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
word
in
that
letter
of
Violet
Effingham
;
and
though
Lady
Laura
do
speak
more
than
once
of
Violet
,
she
always
do
so
as
though
Violet
be
simply
a
joint
acquaintance
of
herself
and
her
correspondent
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
allusion
to
the
existence
of
any
special
regard
on
his
part
for
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
that
Violet
may
probably
tell
her
friend
what
have
occur
at
Saulsby
;
 
but
if
she
do
so
,
Lady
Laura
be
happy
in
her
power
of
reticence
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
be
disturb
also
when
he
reach
home
by
find
that
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
and
Miss
Flood
Jones
have
retire
from
Killaloe
for
the
winter
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
he
may
not
have
be
more
disturb
by
the
presence
of
the
young
lady
,
for
he
would
have
find
himself
constrain
to
exhibit
towards
her
some
tenderness
of
manner
;
and
any
such
tenderness
of
manner
would
,
in
his
exist
circumstance
,
have
be
dangerous
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
make
to
understand
that
Mary
Flood
Jones
have
be
take
away
from
Killaloe
because
it
be
think
that
he
have
ill
-
treat
the
lady
,
and
the
accusation
make
him
unhappy
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
heat
of
the
last
session
he
have
receive
a
letter
from
his
sister
,
in
which
some
push
question
have
be
ask
as
to
his
then
exist
feel
about
poor
Mary
.
<EOS>
this
he
have
answer
petulantly
.
<EOS>
nothing
more
have
be
write
to
him
about
Miss
Jones
,
and
nothing
be
say
to
him
when
he
reach
home
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
however
,
but
ask
after
Mary
,
and
when
he
do
ask
,
the
accusation
be
make
again
in
that
quietly
severe
manner
with
which
,
perhaps
,
most
of
us
have
be
make
acquaint
at
some
period
of
our
life
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Phineas
,
"
say
his
sister
,
"
we
have
better
say
nothing
about
dear
Mary
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
here
at
present
,
and
probably
you
may
not
see
her
while
you
remain
with
us
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
be
all
that
about
?
<EOS>
"
Phineas
have
demand
,
 
understand
the
whole
matter
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
then
his
sister
have
demurely
refuse
to
say
a
word
further
on
the
subject
,
and
not
a
word
further
be
say
about
Miss
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
They
be
at
Floodborough
,
live
<EOS>
,
he
do
not
doubt
,
in
a
very
desolate
way
,
 
and
quite
willing
,
he
do
not
doubt
also
,
to
abandon
their
desolation
if
he
would
go
over
there
in
the
manner
that
would
become
him
after
what
have
pass
on
one
or
two
occasion
between
him
and
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
but
how
be
he
to
do
this
with
such
work
on
his
hand
as
he
have
undertake
?
<EOS>
now
that
he
be
in
Ireland
,
he
think
that
he
do
love
dear
Mary
very
dearly
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
have
two
identity
,
 
that
he
be
,
as
it
be
,
two
separate
person
,
 
and
that
he
could
,
without
any
real
faithlessness
,
be
very
much
in
love
with
Violet
Effingham
in
his
position
of
man
of
fashion
and
member
of
Parliament
in
England
,
and
also
warmly
attach
to
dear
little
Mary
Flood
Jones
as
an
Irishman
of
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
He
be
aware
,
however
,
that
there
be
a
prejudice
against
such
fulness
of
heart
,
and
,
therefore
,
resolve
sternly
that
it
be
his
duty
to
be
constant
to
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
how
be
it
possible
that
he
should
marry
dear
Mary
,
 
he
,
with
such
extensive
job
of
work
on
his
hand
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
possible
.
<EOS>
He
must
abandon
all
thought
of
make
dear
Mary
his
own
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
they
have
be
right
to
remove
her
.
<EOS>
but
,
still
,
as
he
take
his
solitary
walk
along
the
Shannon
,
and
up
on
the
hill
that
overhang
the
lake
above
the
town
,
he
feel
somewhat
ashamed
of
himself
,
and
dream
of
give
up
Parliament
,
of
leave
Violet
to
some
noble
suitor
,
 
to
Lord
Chiltern
,
if
she
would
take
him
,
 
and
of
go
to
Floodborough
with
an
honest
proposal
that
he
should
be
allow
to
press
Mary
to
his
heart
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
would
probably
reject
him
at
last
;
whereas
Mary
,
dear
Mary
,
would
come
to
his
heart
without
a
scruple
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
dear
Mary
!
<EOS>
in
these
day
of
dream
,
he
tell
himself
that
,
after
all
,
dear
Mary
be
his
real
love
.
<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
such
day
be
day
of
dream
only
.
<EOS>
He
have
letter
in
his
pocket
from
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
which
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
think
in
earnest
of
give
up
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
there
come
a
wonderful
piece
of
luck
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
there
live
,
or
have
live
,
in
the
town
of
Galway
a
very
eccentric
old
lady
,
one
Miss
Marian
Persse
,
who
be
the
aunt
of
Mrs.
Finn
,
the
mother
of
our
hero
.
<EOS>
with
this
lady
Dr.
Finn
have
quarrel
persistently
ever
since
his
marriage
,
because
the
lady
have
express
her
wish
to
interfere
in
the
management
of
his
family
,
 
offer
to
purchase
such
right
by
favourable
arrangement
in
reference
to
her
will
.
<EOS>
this
the
doctor
have
resent
,
and
there
have
be
quarrel
.
<EOS>
Miss
Persse
be
not
a
very
rich
old
lady
,
but
she
think
a
good
deal
of
her
own
money
.
<EOS>
and
now
she
die
,
leave
£
3,000
to
her
nephew
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
another
sum
of
about
equal
amount
she
bequeath
to
a
roman
catholic
seminary
;
and
thus
be
her
worldly
wealth
divide
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
have
do
better
with
it
,
"
say
the
old
doctor
;
"
and
as
far
as
we
be
concern
,
the
windfall
be
the
more
pleasant
as
be
wholly
unexpected
.
<EOS>
"
in
these
day
the
doctor
be
undoubtedly
gratify
by
his
son
's
success
in
life
,
and
never
say
much
about
the
law
.
<EOS>
phineas
in
truth
do
do
some
work
during
the
autumn
,
read
blue
-
book
,
read
law
book
,
read
perhaps
a
novel
or
two
at
the
same
time
,
 
but
shut
himself
up
very
carefully
as
he
study
,
so
that
his
sister
be
make
to
understand
that
for
a
certain
four
hour
in
the
day
not
a
sound
be
to
be
allow
to
disturb
him
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
receipt
of
his
legacy
he
at
once
offer
to
repay
his
father
all
money
that
have
be
advance
him
over
and
above
his
original
allowance
;
but
this
the
doctor
refuse
to
take
.
<EOS>
"
It
come
to
the
same
thing
,
Phineas
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
what
you
have
of
your
share
now
you
can
not
have
hereafter
.
<EOS>
as
regard
my
present
income
,
it
have
only
make
me
work
a
little
longer
than
I
have
intend
;
and
I
believe
that
the
later
in
life
a
man
work
,
the
more
likely
he
be
to
live
.
<EOS>
"
phineas
,
therefore
,
when
he
return
to
London
,
have
his
£
3,000
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
owe
some
£
500
;
and
the
remainder
he
would
,
of
course
,
invest
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
some
talk
of
an
autumnal
session
,
but
Mr.
Mildmay
's
decision
have
at
last
be
against
it
.
<EOS>
who
can
not
understand
that
such
would
be
the
decision
of
any
Minister
to
whom
be
leave
the
slight
fraction
of
free
will
in
the
matter
?
<EOS>
why
should
any
Minister
court
the
danger
of
unnecessary
attack
,
submit
himself
to
unnecessary
work
,
and
incur
the
odium
of
summon
all
his
friend
from
their
rest
?
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
the
doubt
as
to
the
new
and
old
Ministry
,
when
the
political
needle
be
vacillate
so
tremulously
on
its
pivot
,
point
now
to
one
set
of
man
as
the
come
government
and
then
to
another
,
vague
suggestion
as
to
an
autumn
session
may
be
useful
.
<EOS>
and
they
be
throw
out
in
all
good
faith
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
when
he
speak
on
the
subject
to
the
Duke
,
be
earnest
in
think
that
the
question
of
Reform
should
not
be
postpone
even
for
six
month
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
pledge
yourself
,
"
say
the
Duke
;
 
and
Mr.
Mildmay
do
not
pledge
himself
.
<EOS>
afterwards
,
when
Mr.
Mildmay
find
that
he
be
once
more
assuredly
Prime
Minister
,
he
change
his
mind
,
and
feel
himself
to
be
under
a
fresh
obligation
to
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
have
altogether
fail
,
and
the
country
may
very
well
wait
till
February
.
<EOS>
the
country
do
wait
till
February
,
somewhat
to
the
disappointment
of
Phineas
Finn
,
who
have
become
tired
of
blue
-
book
at
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
the
difference
between
his
english
life
and
his
life
at
home
be
so
great
,
that
it
be
hardly
possible
that
he
should
not
become
weary
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
He
do
become
weary
of
it
,
but
strove
gallantly
to
hide
his
weariness
from
his
father
and
mother
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
time
the
world
be
talk
much
about
Reform
,
though
Mr.
Mildmay
have
become
placidly
patient
.
<EOS>
the
feeling
be
grow
,
and
Mr.
Turnbull
,
with
his
friend
,
be
do
all
he
could
to
make
it
grow
fast
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
amount
of
excitement
on
the
subject
;
but
the
excitement
have
grow
downward
,
from
the
leader
to
the
people
,
 
from
the
self
-
institute
leader
of
popular
politic
down
,
by
mean
of
the
press
,
to
the
rank
of
work
man
,
instead
of
grow
upwards
,
from
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
masse
,
till
it
express
itself
by
this
mouthpiece
and
that
,
choose
by
the
people
themselves
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
strong
throb
through
the
country
,
make
man
feel
that
safety
be
to
be
have
by
reform
,
and
could
not
be
have
without
Reform
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
an
understanding
that
the
press
and
the
orator
be
too
strong
to
be
ignore
,
and
that
some
new
measure
of
reform
must
be
concede
to
them
.
<EOS>
the
sooner
the
concession
be
make
,
the
less
it
may
be
necessary
to
concede
.
<EOS>
and
all
man
of
all
party
be
agree
on
this
point
.
<EOS>
that
Reform
be
in
itself
odious
to
many
of
those
who
speak
of
it
freely
,
who
offer
themselves
willingly
to
be
its
promoter
,
be
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
odious
to
Lord
de
Terrier
and
to
most
of
those
who
work
with
him
,
but
be
equally
so
to
many
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
most
constant
supporter
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
have
no
wish
for
reform
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
hard
to
suppose
that
such
a
Duke
can
wish
for
any
change
in
a
state
of
thing
that
must
seem
to
him
to
be
so
salutary
.
<EOS>
workman
be
get
full
wage
.
<EOS>
farmer
be
pay
their
rent
.
<EOS>
capitalist
by
the
dozen
be
create
capitalist
by
the
hundred
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
wrong
in
the
country
,
but
the
over
-
dominant
spirit
of
speculative
commerce
;
 
and
there
be
nothing
in
reform
to
check
that
.
<EOS>
why
should
the
Duke
want
reform
?
<EOS>
as
for
such
man
as
Lord
Brentford
,
Sir
Harry
Coldfoot
,
Lord
Plinlimmon
,
and
Mr.
Legge
Wilson
,
it
be
know
to
all
man
that
they
advocate
Reform
as
we
all
of
us
advocate
doctor
.
<EOS>
some
amount
of
doctoring
be
necessary
for
us
.
<EOS>
We
may
hardly
hope
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
but
let
us
have
as
little
of
the
doctor
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
,
and
the
cheap
press
,
and
the
rise
spirit
of
the
loud
among
the
people
,
make
it
manifest
that
something
must
be
concede
.
<EOS>
let
us
be
generous
in
our
concession
.
<EOS>
that
be
now
the
doctrine
of
many
,
 
perhaps
of
most
of
the
lead
politician
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
let
us
be
generous
.
<EOS>
let
us
at
any
rate
seem
to
be
generous
.
<EOS>
let
us
give
with
an
open
hand
,
 
but
still
with
a
hand
which
,
though
open
,
shall
not
bestow
too
much
.
<EOS>
the
coach
must
be
allow
to
run
down
the
hill
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
unless
the
coach
go
on
run
no
journey
will
be
make
.
<EOS>
but
let
us
have
the
drag
on
both
the
hind
wheel
.
<EOS>
and
we
must
remember
that
coach
run
down
hill
without
drag
be
apt
to
come
to
serious
misfortune
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
man
,
even
in
the
Cabinet
,
who
have
other
idea
of
public
service
than
that
of
drag
the
wheel
of
the
coach
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
be
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Plantagenet
Palliser
be
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
that
exceedingly
intelligent
young
nobleman
Lord
Cantrip
be
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
throw
,
perhaps
,
as
much
of
earnestness
into
the
matter
as
be
compatible
with
his
age
and
his
full
appreciation
of
the
manner
in
which
the
present
cry
for
reform
have
be
arouse
.
<EOS>
He
be
thoroughly
honest
,
thoroughly
patriotic
,
and
thoroughly
ambitious
that
he
should
be
write
of
hereafter
as
one
who
to
the
end
of
a
long
life
have
work
sedulously
for
the
welfare
of
the
people
;
 
but
he
disbelieve
in
Mr.
Turnbull
,
and
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
indulge
an
aristocratic
contempt
for
the
penny
press
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
no
man
in
England
more
in
earnest
,
more
truly
desirous
of
reform
,
than
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
great
political
idea
that
political
advantage
should
be
extend
to
the
people
,
whether
the
people
clamour
for
them
or
do
not
clamour
for
them
,
 
even
whether
they
desire
them
or
do
not
desire
them
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
ask
a
child
whether
he
would
like
to
learn
his
lesson
,
"
he
would
say
.
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
,
you
do
not
wait
till
he
cry
for
his
book
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
man
say
to
him
that
there
be
no
earnestness
in
the
cry
for
Reform
,
that
the
cry
be
a
false
cry
,
get
up
for
factious
purpose
by
interested
person
,
he
would
reply
that
the
thing
to
be
do
should
not
be
do
in
obedience
to
any
cry
,
but
because
it
be
demand
by
justice
,
and
be
a
debt
due
to
the
people

<EOS>
Our
hero
in
the
autumn
have
write
to
Mr.
Monk
on
the
politic
of
the
moment
,
and
the
following
have
be
Mr.
Monk
's
reply
:
    
Longroyston
,
October
12
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
finn
,
  
<EOS>
I
be
stay
here
with
the
Duke
and
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
very
full
,
and
Mr.
Mildmay
be
here
last
week
;
but
as
I
do
not
shoot
,
and
can
not
play
billiard
,
and
have
no
taste
for
charade
,
I
be
become
tired
of
the
gaiety
,
and
shall
leave
them
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
know
that
we
be
not
to
have
the
autumn
session
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
Mr.
Mildmay
be
right
.
<EOS>
Could
we
have
be
sure
of
pass
our
measure
<EOS>
,
it
would
have
be
very
well
;
but
we
could
not
have
be
sure
,
and
failure
with
our
bill
in
a
session
convene
for
the
express
purpose
of
pass
it
would
have
injure
the
cause
greatly
.
<EOS>
We
could
hardly
have
go
on
with
it
again
in
the
spring
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
we
must
have
resign
.
<EOS>
and
though
I
may
truly
say
that
I
would
as
lief
have
a
good
measure
from
Lord
de
Terrier
as
from
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
that
I
be
indifferent
to
my
own
present
personal
position
,
still
I
think
that
we
should
endeavour
to
keep
our
seat
as
long
as
we
honestly
believe
ourselves
to
be
more
capable
of
pass
a
good
measure
than
be
our
opponent
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
astonish
by
the
difference
of
opinion
which
exist
about
Reform
,
 
not
only
as
to
the
difference
in
the
extent
and
exact
tendency
of
the
measure
that
be
need
,
 
but
that
there
should
be
such
a
divergence
of
idea
as
to
the
grand
thing
to
be
do
and
the
grand
reason
for
do
it
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
agree
that
we
want
reform
in
order
that
the
House
of
Commons
may
be
return
by
a
large
proportion
of
the
people
than
be
at
present
employ
upon
that
work
,
and
that
each
member
when
return
should
represent
a
somewhat
more
equal
section
of
the
whole
constituency
of
the
country
than
our
member
generally
do
at
present
.
<EOS>
all
man
confess
that
a
£
50
county
franchise
must
be
too
high
,
and
that
a
borough
with
less
than
two
hundred
register
voter
must
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
to
me
that
but
few
among
us
perceive
,
or
at
any
rate
acknowledge
,
the
real
reason
for
change
these
thing
and
reform
what
be
wrong
without
delay
.
<EOS>
one
great
authority
tell
us
the
other
day
that
the
sole
object
of
legislation
on
this
subject
should
be
to
get
together
the
good
possible
658
member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
that
to
me
would
be
a
most
repulsive
idea
if
it
be
not
that
by
its
very
vagueness
it
become
inoperative
.
<EOS>
who
shall
say
what
be
good
;
or
what
characteristic
constitute
excellence
in
a
member
of
Parliament
?
<EOS>
if
the
gentleman
mean
excellence
in
general
wisdom
,
or
in
statecraft
,
or
in
skill
in
talking
,
or
in
private
character
,
or
even
excellence
in
patriotism
,
then
I
say
that
he
be
utterly
wrong
,
and
have
never
touch
with
his
intellect
the
true
theory
of
representation
.
<EOS>
one
only
excellence
may
be
acknowledge
,
and
that
be
the
excellence
of
likeness
.
<EOS>
as
a
portrait
should
be
like
the
person
portray
,
so
should
a
representative
House
be
like
the
people
whom
it
represent
.
<EOS>
nor
in
arrange
a
franchise
do
it
seem
to
me
that
we
have
a
right
to
regard
any
other
view
.
<EOS>
if
a
country
be
unfit
for
representative
government
,
 
<EOS>
and
it
may
be
that
there
be
still
people
unable
to
use
properly
that
great
of
all
blessing
,
 
<EOS>
the
question
as
to
what
state
policy
may
be
good
for
them
be
a
different
question
.
<EOS>
but
if
we
do
have
representation
,
let
the
representative
assembly
be
like
the
people
<EOS>
,
whatever
else
may
be
its
virtue
,
 
and
whatever
else
its
vice
.
  
<EOS>
another
great
authority
have
tell
us
that
our
House
of
Commons
should
be
the
mirror
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
not
its
mirror
,
but
its
miniature
.
<EOS>
and
let
the
artist
be
careful
to
put
in
every
line
of
the
expression
of
that
ever
-
move
face
.
<EOS>
to
do
this
be
a
great
work
,
and
the
artist
must
know
his
trade
well
.
<EOS>
in
America
the
work
have
be
do
with
so
coarse
a
hand
that
nothing
be
show
in
the
picture
but
the
broad
,
plain
,
unspeake
outline
of
the
face
.
<EOS>
as
you
look
from
the
represent
to
the
representation
you
can
not
but
acknowledge
the
likeness
;
  
but
there
be
in
that
portrait
more
of
the
body
than
of
the
mind
.
<EOS>
the
true
portrait
should
represent
more
than
the
body
.
<EOS>
with
us
,
hitherto
,
there
have
be
snatch
of
the
countenance
of
the
nation
which
have
be
inimitable
,
 
a
turn
of
the
eye
here
and
a
curl
of
the
lip
there
,
which
have
seem
to
denote
a
power
almost
divine
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
marvel
on
the
canvas
so
beautiful
that
one
approach
the
work
of
remodelle
it
with
awe
.
<EOS>
but
not
only
be
the
picture
imperfect
,
 
a
thing
of
snatch
,
 
but
with
year
it
become
less
and
still
less
like
its
original
.
  
<EOS>
the
necessity
for
remodelle
it
be
imperative
,
and
we
shall
be
coward
if
we
decline
the
work
.
<EOS>
but
let
us
be
specially
careful
to
retain
as
much
as
possible
of
those
line
which
we
all
acknowledge
to
be
so
faithfully
representative
of
our
nation
.
<EOS>
to
give
to
a
bare
numerical
majority
of
the
people
that
power
which
the
numerical
majority
have
in
the
United
States
,
would
not
be
to
achieve
representation
.
<EOS>
the
nation
as
it
now
exist
would
not
be
know
by
such
a
portrait
;
 
but
neither
can
it
now
be
know
by
that
which
exist
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
they
who
be
adverse
to
change
,
look
back
with
an
unmeasured
respect
on
what
our
old
parliament
have
do
for
us
,
ignore
the
majestic
growth
of
the
english
people
,
and
forget
the
present
in
their
worship
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
They
think
that
we
must
be
what
we
be
,
 
at
any
rate
,
what
we
be
thirty
year
since
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
,
perhaps
,
go
into
the
house
of
artisan
,
or
,
if
there
,
they
have
not
look
into
the
breast
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
with
population
vice
have
increase
,
and
these
politician
,
with
ear
but
no
eye
,
hear
of
drunkenness
and
sin
and
ignorance
.
<EOS>
and
then
they
declare
to
themselves
that
this
wicked
,
half
-
barbarous
,
idle
people
should
be
control
and
not
represent
.
<EOS>
a
wicked
,
half
-
barbarous
,
idle
people
may
be
control
;
 
but
not
a
people
thoughtful
,
educate
,
and
industrious
.
<EOS>
We
must
look
to
it
that
we
do
not
endeavour
to
carry
our
control
beyond
the
wickedness
and
the
barbarity
,
and
that
we
be
ready
to
submit
to
control
from
thoughtfulness
and
industry
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
find
you
help
at
the
good
work
early
in
the
spring
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
always
faithfully
,
  
JOSHUA
MONK
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
be
up
in
London
before
the
end
of
January
,
but
do
not
find
there
many
of
those
whom
he
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
be
there
,
and
to
him
he
show
Mr.
Monk
's
letter
,
think
that
it
must
be
convince
even
to
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
this
he
do
in
Mrs.
Low
's
drawing
-
room
,
know
that
Mrs.
Low
would
also
condescend
to
discuss
politic
on
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
have
dine
with
them
,
and
they
have
be
glad
to
see
him
,
and
Mrs.
Low
have
be
less
severe
than
hitherto
against
the
great
sin
of
her
husband
's
late
pupil
.
<EOS>
She
have
condescend
to
congratulate
him
on
become
member
for
an
english
borough
instead
of
an
irish
one
,
and
have
ask
him
question
about
Saulsby
Castle
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
Mr.
Monk
's
letter
be
not
receive
with
that
respectful
admiration
which
Phineas
think
that
it
deserve
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
foolishly
,
have
read
it
out
loud
,
so
that
the
attack
come
upon
him
simultaneously
from
the
husband
and
from
the
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
the
usual
claptrap
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
,
"
only
put
into
language
somewhat
more
grandiloquent
than
usual
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Claptrap
!
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
what
I
call
downright
radical
nonsense
,
"
say
Mrs.
Low
,
nod
her
head
energetically
.
<EOS>
"
portrait
indeed
!
<EOS>
why
should
we
want
to
have
a
portrait
of
ignorance
and
ugliness
?
<EOS>
what
we
all
want
be
to
have
thing
quiet
and
orderly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
would
better
have
a
paternal
government
at
once
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
so
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
,
 
"
only
that
what
you
call
a
paternal
government
be
not
always
quiet
and
orderly
.
<EOS>
national
order
I
take
to
be
submission
to
the
law
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
think
it
quiet
and
orderly
if
I
be
send
to
Cayenne
without
be
bring
before
a
jury
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
such
a
man
as
you
would
not
be
send
to
Cayenne
,
"
say
Phineas
,
  
"
<EOS>
My
next
-
door
neighbour
may
be
,
 
which
would
be
almost
as
bad
.
<EOS>
let
him
be
send
to
Cayenne
if
he
deserve
it
,
but
let
a
jury
say
that
he
have
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
My
idea
of
government
be
this
,
 
that
we
want
to
be
govern
by
law
and
not
by
caprice
,
and
that
we
must
have
a
legislature
to
make
our
law
.
<EOS>
if
I
think
that
Parliament
as
at
present
establish
make
the
law
badly
,
I
would
desire
a
change
;
but
I
doubt
whether
we
shall
have
them
better
from
any
change
in
Parliament
which
Reform
will
give
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
not
,
"
say
Mrs.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
but
we
shall
have
a
lot
of
beggar
put
on
horseback
,
and
we
all
know
where
they
ride
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
Phineas
become
aware
that
it
be
not
easy
to
convince
any
man
or
any
woman
on
a
point
of
politic
,
 
not
even
though
he
who
argue
may
have
an
eloquent
letter
from
a
philosophical
Cabinet
Minister
in
his
pocket
to
assist
him
.
   
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
make
<EOS>
Progress
 
February
be
far
advanced
and
the
new
Reform
Bill
have
already
be
bring
forward
,
before
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
come
up
to
town
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
of
course
see
Mr.
Kennedy
and
have
hear
from
him
tiding
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
be
at
Saulsby
with
Lady
Baldock
and
Miss
Boreham
and
Violet
Effingham
,
but
be
to
be
in
London
soon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
as
it
appear
,
do
not
quite
know
when
he
be
to
expect
his
wife
;
and
Phineas
think
that
he
could
perceive
from
the
tone
of
the
husband
's
voice
that
something
be
amiss
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
however
ask
any
question
except
such
as
refer
to
the
expect
arrival
.
<EOS>
be
Miss
Effingham
to
come
to
London
with
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
believe
that
Miss
Effingham
would
be
up
before
Easter
,
but
he
do
not
know
whether
she
would
come
with
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
woman
,
"
he
say
,
"
be
so
fond
of
mystery
that
one
can
never
quite
know
what
they
intend
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
He
correct
himself
at
once
however
,
perceive
that
he
have
seem
to
say
something
against
his
wife
,
and
explain
that
his
general
accusation
against
the
sex
be
not
intend
to
apply
to
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
he
do
so
awkwardly
as
to
strengthen
the
feeling
with
Phineas
that
something
assuredly
be
wrong
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
never
seem
to
know
her
own
mind
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
be
like
other
beautiful
girl
who
be
pet
on
all
side
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
for
her
beauty
,
I
do
not
think
much
of
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
;
"
and
as
for
petting
,
I
do
not
understand
it
in
reference
to
grown
person
.
<EOS>
child
may
be
pet
,
and
dog
,
 
though
that
too
be
bad
;
but
what
you
call
pet
for
grown
person
be
I
think
frivolous
and
almost
indecent
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
could
not
help
think
of
Lord
Chiltern
's
opinion
that
it
would
have
be
wise
to
have
leave
Mr.
Kennedy
in
the
hand
of
the
garrotter
.
  
<EOS>
the
debate
on
the
second
reading
of
the
bill
be
to
be
commence
on
the
1st
of
March
,
and
two
day
before
that
Lady
Laura
arrive
in
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
Phineas
get
a
note
from
her
in
three
word
to
say
that
she
be
at
home
and
would
see
him
if
he
call
on
Sunday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
the
Sunday
to
which
she
allude
be
the
last
day
of
February

<EOS>
Phineas
be
now
more
certain
than
ever
that
something
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
have
there
be
nothing
wrong
between
Lady
Laura
and
her
husband
<EOS>
,
she
would
not
have
rebel
against
him
by
ask
visitor
to
the
house
on
a
Sunday
.
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
,
however
,
and
of
course
he
do
as
he
be
desire
.
<EOS>
He
call
on
the
Sunday
,
and
find
Mrs.
Bonteen
sit
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
just
in
time
for
the
debate
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
when
the
first
greeting
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
intend
to
sit
it
out
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
every
word
of
it
,
 
unless
I
lose
my
seat
.
<EOS>
what
else
be
there
to
be
do
at
present
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
place
they
give
us
be
so
unpleasant
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
bad
place
even
than
the
Ladies
'
Gallery
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
and
perhaps
it
be
as
well
to
make
oneself
use
to
inconvenience
of
all
kind
.
<EOS>
You
will
speak
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
will
.
<EOS>
the
great
speech
will
be
Mr.
Gresham
's
,
Mr.
Daubeny
's
,
and
Mr.
Monk
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Palliser
intend
to
be
very
strong
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
man
can
not
be
strong
or
not
as
he
like
it
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
I
believe
to
be
a
most
useful
man
,
but
he
never
can
become
an
orator
.
<EOS>
He
be
of
the
same
class
as
Mr.
Kennedy
,
 
only
of
course
high
in
the
class
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
look
for
a
great
speech
from
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
slight
idea
whether
he
will
open
his
lip
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
immediately
after
that
Mrs.
Bonteen
take
her
leave
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
that
woman
like
poison
,
"
continue
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
always
play
a
game
,
and
it
be
such
a
small
game
that
she
play
!
<EOS>
and
she
contribute
so
little
to
society
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
witty
nor
well
-
inform
,
 
not
even
sufficiently
ignorant
or
ridiculous
to
be
a
laughing
-
stock
.
<EOS>
one
get
nothing
from
her
,
and
yet
she
have
make
her
foot
good
in
the
world

<EOS>

<EOS>

I

she
be
a
friend
of
yours

<EOS>
"
You
do
not

so
!
<EOS>
You
could
not
have
think
so
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
bring
such
an
accusation
against
me
,
know
me
as
you
do
?
<EOS>
but
never
mind
Mrs.
Bonteen
now
.
<EOS>
on
what
day
shall
you
speak
?

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
on
Tuesday
if
I
can

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I

you
can
arrange
it

<EOS>

I
shall
endeavour

do
so

as
far
as
any
arrangement
can
go

"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
carry
the
second
reading

Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Phineas
;
"
I
think
we
shall

but
by
the
vote
of
man
who
be
determine
so
to
pull
the
bill

in
committee
,
that
its

I
doubt
whether

stand

<EOS>

They
tell
me
that

abandon

Phineas

<EOS>
"
well
;
 
we
shall
see
.
<EOS>
My
own
impression
be
that
nothing
would
save
the
country
so
effectually
at
the
present
moment
as
the
removal
of
Mr.
Turnbull
to
a
high

forbid

Phineas
sit
there
for
half
an
hour

then
get
up
to
go

have
speak
no
word
on
any

subject

that
of
politic

<EOS>
He
long
to

He
long
to
make

inquiry

Lord
Chiltern

and
,
to
tell
the
truth

he
feel
painfully
curious
to
hear
Lady

<EOS>
He
could
not

remember
what
have

"
one

Mr.

hardly
look

do
so

have

yourself

look
in
when
you
can

I
will
not
ask
you

so
frightfully
dull

do
your
good
on
Tuesday

us
see
you
on
Wednesday

<EOS>
good

"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
as
he
walk
across
the
park
towards
his
club
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
forget
the
scene
by
the
waterfall
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
quite
know
what
it
have
mean
,
and
he
would
wipe
it
away
from
his
mind
altogether
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledge
to
himself
that
chivalry
do
demand
of
him
that
he
should
never
allow
himself
to
think
of
Lady
Laura
's
rash
word
to
him
.
<EOS>
that
she
be
not
happy
with
her
husband
<EOS>
be
very
clear
to
him
;
 
but
that
be
altogether
another
affair
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
unhappy
with
her
husband
without
indulge
any
guilty
love
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
think
it
possible
that
she
could
be
happy
live
with
such
a
husband
as
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
all
that
,
however
,
be
now
past
remedy
,
and
she
must
simply
endure
the
mode
of
life
which
she
have
prepare
for
herself
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
man
and
woman
in
London
tie
together
for
well
and
bad
,
in
reference
to
whose
union
their
friend
know
that
there
would
be
no
well
;
 
that
it
must
be
all
bad
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
must
bear
it
,
as
it
be
bear
by
many
another
married
woman
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Monday
morning
Phineas
call
at
Moroni
's
hotel
at
ten
o'clock
,
but
in
spite
of
Lady
Laura
's
assurance
to
the
contrary
,
he
find
that
Lord
Chiltern
be
out
.
<EOS>
He
have
feel
some
palpitation
at
the
heart
as
he
make
his
inquiry
,
know
well
the
fiery
nature
of
the
man
he
expect
to
see
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
there
would
be
some
actual
personal
conflict
between
him
and
this
half
-
mad
lord
before
he
get
back
again
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
what
Lady
Laura
have
say
about
her
brother
do
not
in
the
estimation
of
Phineas
make
this
at
all
the
less
probable
.
<EOS>
the
half
-
mad
lord
be
so
singular
in
his
way
that
it
may
well
be
that
he
should
speak
handsomely
of
a
rival
behind
his
back
and
yet
take
him
by
the
throat
as
soon
as
they
be
together
,
face
to
face
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
as
Phineas
think
,
it
be
necessary
that
he
should
see
the
half
-
mad
lord
.
<EOS>
He
have
write
a
letter
to
which
he
have
receive
no
reply
,
and
he
consider
it
to
be
incumbent
on
him
to
ask
whether
it
have
be
receive
and
whether
any
answer
to
it
be
intend
to
be
give
.
<EOS>
He
go
therefore
to
Lord
Chiltern
at
once
,
 
as
I
have
say
,
with
some
feeling
at
his
heart
that
there
may
be
violence
,
at
any
rate
of
word
,
before
he
should
find
himself
again
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
Chiltern
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
all
that
the
porter
know
be
that
Lord
Chiltern
intend
to
leave
the
house
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
then
Phineas
write
a
note
and
leave
it
with
the
porter
.
  
<EOS>
dear
CHILTERN
,
  
I
particularly
want
to
see
you
with
reference
to
a
letter
I
write
to
you
last
summer
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
in
the
House
to
-
day
from
four
till
the
debate
be
over
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
at
the
Reform
Club
from
two
till
half
-
past
three
,
and
will
come
if
you
will
send
for
me
,
or
I
will
meet
you
anywhere
at
any
hour
to
-
morrow
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
always
,
P.
F.
  
no
message
come
to
him
at
the
Reform
Club
,
and
he
be
in
his
seat
in
the
House
by
four
o'clock
.
<EOS>
during
the
debate
a
note
be
bring
to
him
,
which
run
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
I
have
get
your
letter
this
moment
.
<EOS>
of
course
we
must
meet
.
<EOS>
I
hunt
on
Tuesday
,
and
go
down
by
the
early
train
;
but
I
will
come
to
town
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
We
shall
require
to
be
private
,
and
I
will
therefore
be
at
your
room
at
one
o'clock
on
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
C.
  
Phineas
at
once
perceive
that
the
note
be
a
hostile
note
,
write
in
an
angry
spirit
,
 
write
to
one
whom
the
writer
do
not
at
the
moment
acknowledge
to
be
his
friend
.
<EOS>
this
be
certainly
the
case
,
whatever
Lord
Chiltern
may
have
say
to
his
sister
as
to
his
friendship
for
Phineas
.
<EOS>
Phineas
crush
the
note
into
his
pocket
,
and
of
course
determine
that
he
would
be
in
his
room
at
the
hour
name
.
  
<EOS>
the
debate
be
open
by
a
speech
from
Mr.
Mildmay
,
in
which
that
gentleman
at
great
length
and
with
much
perspicuity
explain
his
notion
of
that
measure
of
Parliamentary
Reform
which
he
think
to
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
be
listen
to
with
the
great
attention
to
the
close
,
 
and
perhaps
,
at
the
end
of
his
speech
,
with
more
attention
than
usual
,
as
there
have
go
abroad
a
rumour
that
the
Prime
Minister
intend
to
declare
that
this
would
be
the
last
effort
of
his
life
in
that
course
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
he
ever
intend
to
utter
such
a
pledge
,
his
heart
misgave
him
when
the
time
come
for
utter
it
.
<EOS>
He
merely
say
that
as
the
management
of
the
bill
in
committee
would
be
an
affair
of
much
labour
,
and
probably
spread
over
many
night
,
he
would
be
assist
in
his
work
by
his
colleague
,
and
especially
by
his
right
honourable
friend
the
Secretary
of
State
for
Foreign
Affairs
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
understand
that
Mr.
Gresham
would
take
the
lead
<EOS>
should
the
bill
go
into
committee
;
 
but
it
be
understand
also
that
no
resignation
of
leadership
have
be
make
by
Mr.
Mildmay
.
  
<EOS>
the
measure
now
propose
to
the
House
be
very
much
the
same
as
that
which
have
be
bring
forward
in
the
last
session
.
<EOS>
the
exist
theory
of
british
representation
be
not
to
be
change
,
but
the
actual
practice
be
to
be
bring
nearer
to
the
ideal
theory
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
manhood
suffrage
,
and
of
electoral
district
,
be
to
be
as
for
ever
remove
from
the
bulwark
of
the
British
Constitution
.
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
county
with
agricultural
constituency
,
purposely
arrange
to
be
purely
agricultural
,
whenever
the
nature
of
the
county
would
admit
of
its
being
so
.
<EOS>
no
artificer
at
Reform
,
let
him
be
conservative
or
Liberal
,
can
make
Middlesex
or
Lancashire
agricultural
;
but
Wiltshire
and
Suffolk
be
to
be
preserve
inviolable
to
the
plough
,
 
and
the
apple
of
Devonshire
be
still
to
have
their
sway
.
<EOS>
every
town
in
the
three
kingdom
with
a
certain
population
be
to
have
two
member
.
<EOS>
but
here
there
be
much
room
for
cavil
,
 
as
all
man
know
would
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
who
shall
say
what
be
a
town
,
or
where
shall
be
its
limit
?
<EOS>
bit
of
county
may
be
borrow
,
so
as
to
lessen
the
Conservatism
of
the
county
without
endanger
the
Liberalism
of
the
borough
.
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
the
borough
with
one
member
,
 
and
then
the
group
of
little
borough
.
<EOS>
in
the
discussion
of
any
such
arrangement
how
easy
be
the
picking
of
hole
;
how
impossible
the
fabrication
of
a
garment
that
shall
be
impervious
to
such
picking
!
<EOS>
then
again
there
be
that
great
question
of
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
on
that
there
be
to
be
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
again
pledge
himself
to
disappear
from
the
Treasury
bench
should
any
motion
,
clause
,
or
resolution
be
carry
by
that
House
in
favour
of
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
He
speak
for
three
hour
,
and
then
leave
the
carcass
of
his
bill
to
be
fight
for
by
the
oppose
army
.
  
<EOS>
no
reader
of
these
page
will
desire
that
the
speech
in
the
debate
should
be
even
indicate
.
<EOS>
It
soon
become
known
that
the
Conservatives
would
not
divide
the
House
against
the
second
reading
of
the
bill
.
<EOS>
They
declare
,
however
,
very
plainly
their
intention
of
so
alter
the
clause
of
the
bill
in
committee
,
 
or
at
least
of
attempt
so
to
do
,
 
as
to
make
the
bill
their
bill
,
rather
than
the
bill
of
their
opponent
.
<EOS>
to
this
Mr.
Palliser
reply
that
as
long
as
nothing
vital
be
touch
,
the
Government
would
only
be
too
happy
to
oblige
their
friend
opposite
.
<EOS>
if
anything
vital
be
touch
,
the
Government
could
only
fall
back
upon
their
friend
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
and
in
this
way
man
be
very
civil
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Turnbull
,
who
open
the
debate
on
the
Tuesday
,
thunder
out
an
assurance
to
god
and
man
that
he
would
divide
the
House
on
the
second
reading
of
the
bill
itself
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
doubt
but
that
there
be
many
good
man
and
true
to
go
with
him
into
the
lobby
,
but
into
the
lobby
he
would
go
if
he
have
no
more
than
a
single
friend
to
support
him
.
<EOS>
and
he
warn
the
Sovereign
,
and
he
warn
the
House
,
and
he
warn
the
people
of
England
,
that
the
measure
of
Reform
now
propose
by
a
so
-
call
liberal
Minister
be
a
measure
prepare
in
concert
with
the
ancient
enemy
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
loud
,
very
angry
,
and
quite
successful
in
halloo
down
sundry
attempt
which
be
make
to
interrupt
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
find
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
there
be
many
member
here
who
do
not
know
me
yet
,
 
young
member
,
probably
,
who
be
green
from
the
waste
land
and
road
-
side
of
private
life
.
<EOS>
They
will
know
me
soon
,
and
then
,
may
be
,
there
will
be
less
of
this
foolish
noise
,
less
of
this
elongation
of
unnecessary
neck
.
<EOS>
Our
Rome
must
be
arouse
to
a
sense
of
its
danger
by
other
voice
than
these
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
call
to
order
,
but
it
be
rule
that
he
have
not
be
out
of
order
,
 
and
he
be
very
triumphant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
answer
him
,
and
it
be
declare
afterwards
that
Mr.
Monk
's
speech
be
one
of
the
fine
piece
of
oratory
that
have
ever
be
utter
in
that
House
.
<EOS>
He
make
one
remark
personal
to
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agree
with
the
right
honourable
gentleman
in
the
chair
,
"
he
say
,
"
when
he
declare
that
the
honourable
member
be
not
out
of
order
just
now
.
<EOS>
We
all
of
us
agree
with
him
always
on
such
point
.
<EOS>
the
rule
of
our
House
have
be
lay
down
with
the
utmost
latitude
,
so
that
the
course
of
our
debate
may
not
be
frivolously
or
too
easily
interrupted
.
<EOS>
but
a
member
may
be
so
in
order
as
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
House
,
and
to
merit
the
reproach
of
his
countryman
.
<EOS>
"
this
little
duel
give
great
life
to
the
debate
;
but
it
be
say
that
those
two
great
Reformers
,
Mr.
Turnbull
and
Mr.
Monk
,
could
never
again
meet
as
friend
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
debate
on
Tuesday
,
Phineas
get
upon
his
leg
.
<EOS>
the
reader
,
I
trust
,
will
remember
that
hitherto
he
have
fail
altogether
as
a
speaker
.
<EOS>
on
one
occasion
he
have
lack
even
the
spirit
to
use
and
deliver
an
oration
which
he
have
prepare
.
<EOS>
on
a
second
occasion
he
have
break
down
,
 
woefully
,
and
past
all
redemption
,
as
say
those
who
be
not
his
friend
,
 
unfortunately
,
but
not
past
redemption
,
as
say
those
who
be
his
true
friend
.
<EOS>
after
that
once
again
he
have
arise
and
say
a
few
word
which
have
call
for
no
remark
,
and
have
be
speak
as
though
he
be
in
the
habit
of
address
the
House
daily
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubt
whether
there
be
half
-
a
-
dozen
man
now
present
who
recognise
the
fact
that
this
man
,
who
be
so
well
known
to
so
many
of
them
,
be
now
about
to
make
another
attempt
at
a
first
speech
.
<EOS>
Phineas
himself
diligently
attempt
to
forget
that
such
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
have
prepare
for
himself
a
few
heading
of
what
he
intend
to
say
,
and
on
one
or
two
point
have
arrange
his
word
.
<EOS>
His
hope
be
that
even
though
he
should
forget
the
word
,
he
may
still
be
able
to
cling
to
the
thread
of
his
discourse
.
<EOS>
when
he
find
himself
again
upon
his
leg
amidst
those
crowd
seat
,
for
a
few
moment
there
come
upon
him
that
old
sensation
of
awe
.
<EOS>
again
thing
grow
dim
before
his
eye
,
and
again
he
hardly
know
at
which
end
of
that
long
chamber
the
Speaker
be
sit
.
<EOS>
but
there
arise
within
him
a
sudden
courage
,
as
soon
as
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
in
that
room
have
make
itself
intimate
to
his
ear
;
and
after
the
first
few
sentence
,
all
fear
,
all
awe
,
be
go
from
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
read
his
speech
in
the
report
afterwards
,
he
find
that
he
have
stray
very
wide
of
his
intend
course
,
but
he
have
stray
without
tumble
into
ditch
,
or
fall
into
sunken
pit
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
much
from
Mr.
Monk
's
letter
,
but
have
have
the
grace
to
acknowledge
whence
have
come
his
inspiration
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
know
,
however
,
whether
he
have
fail
again
or
not
,
till
Barrington
Erle
come
up
to
him
as
they
be
leave
the
House
,
with
his
old
easy
pressing
manner
.
"
<EOS>
so
you
have
get
into
form
at
last
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
think
that
it
would
come
.
<EOS>
I
never
for
a
moment
believe
but
that
it
would
come
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
answer
not
a
word
;
but
he
go
home
and
lie
awake
all
night
triumphant
.
<EOS>
the
verdict
of
Barrington
Erle
suffice
to
assure
him
that
he
have
succeed
.
   
<EOS>
a
rough
encounter
 
Phineas
,
when
he
wake
,
have
two
matter
to
occupy
his
mind
,
 
his
success
of
the
previous
night
,
and
his
coming
interview
with
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
He
stay
at
home
the
whole
morning
,
know
that
nothing
could
be
do
before
the
hour
Lord
Chiltern
have
name
for
his
visit
.
<EOS>
He
read
every
word
of
the
debate
,
studiously
postpone
the
perusal
of
his
own
speech
till
he
should
come
to
it
in
due
order
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
write
to
his
father
,
commence
his
letter
as
though
his
writing
have
no
reference
to
the
affair
of
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
but
he
soon
find
himself
compel
to
break
into
some
mention
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
send
you
a
_
Times
_
,
"
he
say
,
"
in
order
that
you
may
see
that
I
have
have
my
finger
in
the
pie
.
<EOS>
I
have
hitherto
abstain
from
put
myself
forward
in
the
House
,
partly
through
a
base
fear
for
which
I
despise
myself
,
and
partly
through
a
feeling
of
prudence
that
a
man
of
my
age
should
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
gather
laurel
.
<EOS>
this
be
literally
true
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
the
fear
,
and
there
have
be
the
prudence
.
<EOS>
My
wonder
be
,
that
I
have
not
incur
more
contempt
from
other
because
I
have
be
a
coward
.
<EOS>
People
have
be
so
kind
to
me
that
I
must
suppose
them
to
have
judge
me
more
leniently
than
I
have
judge
myself
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
as
he
be
put
up
the
paper
,
he
look
again
at
his
own
speech
,
and
of
course
read
every
word
of
it
once
more
.
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
it
occur
to
him
that
the
reporter
have
be
more
than
courteous
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
have
follow
him
have
be
,
he
think
,
at
any
rate
as
long
-
winded
as
himself
;
but
to
this
orator
less
than
half
a
column
have
be
grant
.
<EOS>
to
him
have
be
grant
ten
line
in
big
type
,
and
after
that
a
whole
column
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
let
Lord
Chiltern
come
and
do
his
bad
!
  
<EOS>
when
it
want
but
twenty
minute
to
one
,
and
he
be
begin
to
think
in
what
way
he
have
better
answer
the
half
-
mad
lord
,
should
the
lord
in
his
wrath
be
very
mad
,
there
come
to
him
a
note
by
the
hand
of
some
messenger
.
<EOS>
He
know
at
once
that
it
be
from
Lady
Laura
,
and
open
it
in
hot
haste
<EOS>
It
be
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
DEAR
MR
.
FINN
,
  
<EOS>
We
be
all
talk
about
your
speech
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
in
the
gallery
and
hear
it
,
 
and
say
that
he
have
to
thank
me
for
send
you
to
Loughton
.
<EOS>
that
make
me
very
happy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
declare
that
you
be
eloquent
,
but
too
short
.
<EOS>
that
come
from
him
be
praise
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
Barrington
,
who
take
pride
to
himself
that
you
be
his
political
child
.
<EOS>
Violet
say
that
it
be
the
only
speech
she
ever
read
.
<EOS>
I
be
there
,
and
be
delighted
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
that
it
be
in
you
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
L.
K.
  
I
suppose
we
shall
see
you
after
the
House
be
up
,
but
I
write
this
as
I
shall
barely
have
an
opportunity
of
speak
to
you
then
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
in
Portman
Square
,
not
at
home
,
from
six
till
seven
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
in
which
Phineas
refolde
this
note
and
put
it
into
his
breast
coat
-
pocket
be
,
I
think
,
the
happy
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
then
,
before
he
have
withdraw
his
hand
from
his
breast
,
he
remember
that
what
be
now
about
to
take
place
between
him
and
Lord
Chiltern
would
probably
be
the
mean
of
separate
him
altogether
from
Lady
Laura
and
her
family
.
<EOS>
nay
,
may
it
not
render
it
necessary
that
he
should
abandon
the
seat
in
Parliament
which
have
be
confer
upon
him
by
the
personal
kindness
of
Lord
Brentford
?
<EOS>
let
that
be
as
it
may
.
<EOS>
one
thing
be
clear
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
abandon
Violet
Effingham
till
he
should
be
desire
to
do
so
in
the
plain
language
by
Violet
Effingham
herself
.
<EOS>
look
at
his
watch
he
see
that
it
be
one
o'clock
,
and
at
that
moment
Lord
Chiltern
be
announce
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
go
forward
immediately
with
his
hand
out
to
meet
his
visitor
.
<EOS>
"
Chiltern
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
be
very
glad
to
see
you
.
"
<EOS>
but
Lord
Chiltern
do
not
take
his
hand
.
<EOS>
pass
on
to
the
table
,
with
his
hat
still
on
his
head
,
and
with
a
dark
scowl
upon
his
brow
,
the
young
lord
stand
for
a
few
moment
perfectly
silent
.
<EOS>
then
he
chuck
a
letter
across
the
table
to
the
spot
at
which
Phineas
be
stand
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
take
up
the
letter
,
perceive
that
it
be
that
which
he
,
in
his
great
attempt
to
be
honest
,
have
write
from
the
inn
at
Loughton
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
own
letter
to
you
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
it
be
your
letter
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
receive
it
oddly
enough
together
with
your
own
note
at
Moroni
's
,
 
on
Monday
morning
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
round
the
world
,
I
suppose
,
and
reach
me
only
then
.
<EOS>
You
must
withdraw
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
withdraw
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
withdraw
it
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
can
learn
,
without
ask
any
question
which
would
have
commit
myself
or
the
young
lady
,
you
have
not
act
upon
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
yet
do
what
you
there
threaten
to
do
.
<EOS>
in
that
you
have
be
very
wise
,
and
there
can
be
no
difficulty
in
your
withdraw
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
shall
not
withdraw
it
,
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
remember
 
<EOS>
what
 
I
once
 
tell
you
,
 
about
myself
and
Miss
Effingham
?
<EOS>
"
this
question
he
ask
very
slowly
,
pause
between
the
word
,
and
look
full
into
the
face
of
his
rival
,
towards
whom
he
have
gradually
come
near
.
<EOS>
and
his
countenance
,
as
he
do
so
,
be
by
no
means
pleasant
.
<EOS>
the
redness
of
his
complexion
have
become
more
ruddy
than
usual
;
he
still
wear
his
hat
as
though
with
studied
insolence
;
his
right
hand
be
clench
;
and
there
be
that
look
of
angry
purpose
in
his
eye
which
no
man
like
to
see
in
the
eye
of
an
antagonist
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
afraid
of
no
violence
,
personal
to
himself
;
but
he
be
afraid
of
,
 
of
what
I
may
,
perhaps
,
good
call
"
a
row
.
"
<EOS>
to
be
tumble
over
the
chair
and
table
with
his
late
friend
and
present
enemy
in
Mrs.
Bunce
's
room
would
be
most
unpleasant
to
him
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
to
be
blow
he
,
too
,
must
strike
;
 
and
he
be
very
averse
to
strike
Lady
Laura
's
brother
,
Lord
Brentford
's
son
,
Violet
Effingham
's
friend
.
<EOS>
if
need
be
,
however
,
he
would
strike
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
remember
what
you
mean
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
declare
that
you
would
quarrel
with
any
man
who
may
presume
to
address
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
be
it
that
to
which
you
allude
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
that
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
what
you
say
very
well
.
<EOS>
if
nothing
else
be
to
deter
me
from
ask
Miss
Effingham
to
be
my
wife
,
you
will
hardly
think
that
that
ought
to
have
any
weight
.
<EOS>
the
threat
have
no
weight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
speak
as
a
threat
,
sir
,
and
that
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
from
a
friend
to
a
friend
,
 
as
I
think
then
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
the
less
true
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
you
can
think
of
faith
and
truth
and
honesty
of
purpose
when
you
take
advantage
of
my
absence
,
 
you
,
whom
I
have
tell
a
thousand
time
that
I
love
her
better
than
my
own
soul
!
<EOS>
You
stand
before
the
world
as
a
rise
man
,
and
I
stand
before
the
world
as
a
man
 
damned
.
<EOS>
You
have
be
choose
by
my
father
to
sit
for
our
family
borough
,
while
I
be
an
outcast
from
his
house
.
<EOS>
You
have
Cabinet
Ministers
for
your
friend
,
while
I
have
hardly
a
decent
associate
leave
to
me
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
say
of
myself
that
I
have
never
do
anything
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
,
while
this
thing
that
you
be
do
be
unworthy
of
the
low
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
nothing
unworthy
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
write
to
you
instantly
when
I
have
resolve
,
 
though
it
be
painful
to
me
to
have
to
tell
such
a
secret
to
any
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
write
!
<EOS>
yes
;
when
I
be
mile
distant
;
week
,
month
away
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
come
here
to
bullyrag
like
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
I
get
your
letter
only
on
Monday
,
and
know
nothing
of
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
be
Miss
Effingham
to
be
 
your
wife

"
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
have
now
come
quite
close
to
Phineas
,
and
Phineas
feel
that
that
clench
fist
may
be
in
his
face
in
half
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
of
course
be
not
engage
to
him
,
but
it
seem
to
him
that
if
he
be
now
so
to
declare
,
such
declaration
would
appear
to
have
be
draw
from
him
by
fear
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
in
what
position
you
now
stand
towards
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
not
a
coward
you
will
tell
me
.

<EOS>
"
whether
I
tell
you

not

you
know
that
I
be
not

Phineas

<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
to
try
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern

<EOS>
"
but
if
you
please
I
will
ask
you
for
an
answer
to
my
question
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
pause
for
a
moment
,
think
what
honesty
of
purpose
and
a
high
spirit
would
,
when
combine
together
,
demand
of
him
,
and
together
with
these
requirement
<EOS>
he
feel
that
he
be
bind
to
join
some
feeling
of
duty
towards
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
be
stand
there
,
fiery
red
,
with
his
hand
still
clench
,
and
his
hat
still
on
,
wait
for
his
answer
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
have
your
question
again
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
and
I
will
answer
it
if
I
find
that
I
can
do
so
without
loss
of
self
-
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
in
what
position
you
stand
towards
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
mind
,
I
do
not
doubt
at
all
,
but
I
choose
to
have
a
reply
from
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
remember
,
of
course
,
that
I
can
only
answer
to
the
good
of
my
belief

"
  
<EOS>
"
answer
to
the
good
of
your
belief

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
regard
me
as
an
intimate
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
say
as
an
indifferent
acquaintance
,
you
would
,
I
think
,
have
be
nearer
the
mark
.
<EOS>
but
we
will
let
that
be
.
<EOS>
I
presume
I
may
understand
that
you
have
give
up
any
idea

change
that
position

<EOS>
"
You
may
understand
nothing
of
the
kind

Lord
Chiltern

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
;
 
what
hope
have
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
another
thing

<EOS>
I
shall
not
speak
of
that
;
 
at
any
rate
not
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
sir
,
 
"
and
now
Lord
Chiltern
advance
another
step
and
raise
his
hand
as
though
he
be
about
to
put
it
with
some
form
of
violence
on
the
person
of
his
rival
.
  
<EOS>
"
stop
,
Chiltern
,
"
say
Phineas
,
step
back
,
so
that
there
be
some
article
of
furniture
between
him
and
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
choose
that
there
should
be
a
riot
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
call
a
riot
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
believe
that
after
all
you
be
a
poltroon
.
<EOS>
what
I
require
of
you
be
that
you
shall
meet
me
.
<EOS>
Will
you
do
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
,
 
to
fight
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
 
to
fight
;
to
fight
;
to
fight
.
<EOS>
for
what
other
purpose
do
you
suppose
that
I
can
wish
to
meet
you
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
feel
at
the
moment
that
the
fighting
of
a
duel
would
be
destructive
to
all
his
political
hope
.
<EOS>
few
englishman
fight
duel
in
these
day
.
<EOS>
They
who
do
so
be
always
reckon
to
be
fool
.
<EOS>
and
a
duel
between
him
and
Lord
Brentford
's
son
must
,
as
he
think
,
separate
him
from
Violet
,
from
Lady
Laura
,
from
Lord
Brentford
,
and
from
his
borough
.
<EOS>
but
yet
how
could
he
refuse
?
<EOS>
"
what
have
you
to
think
of
,
sir
,
when
such
an
offer
as
that
be
make
to
you
?
"
say
the
fiery
-
red
lord
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
think
whether
I
have
courage
enough
to
refuse
to
make
myself
an
ass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
that
you
do
not
wish
to
have
a
riot
.
<EOS>
that
be
your
way
to
escape
what
you
call
 
a
riot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
bully
me
,
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
sir
;
 
I
simply
want
this
,
that
you
should
leave
me
where
you
find
me
,
and
not
interfere
with
that
which
you
have
long
know
<EOS>
I
claim
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
not
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
can
only
fight
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
send
some
friend
to
me
,
and
I
will
name
some
one
,
whom
he
shall
meet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
will
do
that
if
I
have
your
promise
to
meet
me
.
<EOS>
We
can
be
in
Belgium
in
an
hour
or
two
,
and
back
again
in
a
few
more
hour
;
 
that
is
,
any
one
of
us
who
may
chance
to
be
alive
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
select
a
friend
,
and
will
tell
him
everything
,
and
will
then
do
as
he
bid
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
some
old
steady
-
go
buffer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
certainly
not
be
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
I
shall
probably
ask
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
to
manage
for
me
in
such
an
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
will
see
him
at
once
,
then
,
so
that
Colepepper
may
arrange
with
him
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
and
let
me
assure
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
that
there
will
be
a
meeting
between
us
after
some
fashion
,
let
the
idea
of
your
friend
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
be
what
they
may
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lord
Chiltern
purpose
to
go
,
but
turn
again
as
he
be
go
.
"
<EOS>
and
remember
this
,
"
he
say
,
"
my
complaint
be
that
you
have
be
false
to
me
,
 
damnably
false
;
not
that
you
have
fall
in
love
with
this
young
lady
or
with
that
.
"
<EOS>
then
the
fiery
-
red
lord
open
the
door
for
himself
and
take
his
departure
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
soon
as
he
be
alone
,
walk
down
to
the
House
,
at
which
there
be
an
early
sitting
.
<EOS>
as
he
go
there
be
one
great
question
which
he
have
to
settle
with
himself
,
 
<EOS>
be
there
any
justice
in
the
charge
make
against
him
that
he
have
be
false
to
his
friend
?
<EOS>
when
he
have
think
over
the
matter
at
Saulsby
,
after
rush
down
there
that
he
may
throw
himself
at
Violet
's
foot
,
he
have
assure
himself
that
such
a
letter
as
that
which
he
resolve
to
write
to
Lord
Chiltern
,
would
be
even
chivalrous
in
its
absolute
honesty
.
<EOS>
He
would
tell
his
purpose
to
Lord
Chiltern
the
moment
that
his
purpose
be
form
;
 
and
would
afterwards
speak
of
Lord
Chiltern
behind
his
back
as
one
dear
friend
should
speak
of
another
.
<EOS>
have
Miss
Effingham
show
the
slight
intention
of
accept
Lord
Chiltern
's
offer
,
he
would
have
acknowledge
to
himself
that
the
circumstance
of
his
position
make
it
impossible
that
he
should
,
with
honour
,
become
his
friend
's
rival
.
<EOS>
but
be
he
to
be
debar
for
ever
from
get
that
which
he
want
because
Lord
Chiltern
want
it
also
,
 
<EOS>
knowing
,
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
well
,
that
Lord
Chiltern
could
not
get
the
thing
which
he
want
?
<EOS>
all
this
have
be
quite
sufficient
for
him
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
charge
against
him
that
he
have
be
false
to
his
friend
rang
in
his
ear
and
make
him
unhappy
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
be
true
that
Lord
Chiltern
have
not
give
up
his
hope
,
and
that
he
have
speak
probably
more
openly
to
Phineas
respect
them
than
he
have
do
to
any
other
human
being
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
true
that
he
have
be
false
,
then
he
must
comply
with
any
requisition
which
Lord
Chiltern
may
make
,
 
short
of
voluntarily
give
up
the
lady
.
<EOS>
He
must
fight
if
he
be
ask
to
do
so
,
even
though
fighting
be
his
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
when
again
in
the
House
yesterday
's
scene
come
back
upon
him
,
and
more
than
one
man
come
to
him
congratulate
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
take
his
hand
and
speak
a
word
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
old
Premier
nod
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
greet
him
;
and
Plantagenet
Palliser
openly
tell
him
that
he
have
make
a
good
speech
.
<EOS>
how
sweet
would
all
this
have
be
have
there
not
be
ever
at
his
heart
the
remembrance
of
his
terrible
difficulty
,
 
the
consciousness
that
he
be
about
to
be
force
into
an
absurdity
which
would
put
an
end
to
all
this
sweetness
!
<EOS>
why
be
the
world
in
England
so
severe
against
duelling
?
<EOS>
after
all
,
as
he
regard
the
matter
now
,
a
duel
may
be
the
good
way
,
nay
,
the
only
way
out
of
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
if
he
may
only
be
allow
to
go
out
with
Lord
Chiltern
the
whole
thing
may
be
arrange
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
not
shoot
he
may
carry
on
his
suit
with
Miss
Effingham
unfettere
by
any
impediment
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
be
shoot
,
what
matter
be
that
to
any
one
but
himself
?
<EOS>
why
should
the
world
be
so
thin
-
skinned
,
 
so
foolishly
chary
of
human
life
?
  
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
do
not
come
to
the
House
,
and
Phineas
look
for
him
at
both
the
club
which
he
frequent
,
 
leave
a
note
at
each
as
he
do
not
find
him
.
<EOS>
He
also
leave
a
note
for
him
at
his
lodging
in
Duke
Street
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
you
this
evening
.
<EOS>
I
shall
dine
at
the
Reform
Club
,
 
<EOS>
pray
come
there
.
"
<EOS>
after
that
,
Phineas
go
up
to
Portman
Square
,
in
accordance
with
the
instruction
receive
from
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
there
he
see
Violet
Effingham
,
meet
her
for
the
first
time
since
he
have
part
from
her
on
the
great
step
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
speak
to
her
,
and
of
course
she
be
gracious
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
her
graciousness
be
only
a
smile
and
his
speech
be
only
a
word
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
in
the
room
,
but
not
enough
to
make
privacy
possible
,
 
as
it
become
possible
at
a
crowded
evening
meeting
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
be
there
,
and
the
Bonteens
,
and
Barrington
Erle
,
and
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
,
and
Lord
Cantrip
with
his
young
wife
.
<EOS>
It
be
manifestly
a
meeting
of
liberal
,
semi
-
social
and
semi
-
political
;
 
so
arrange
that
lady
may
feel
that
some
interest
in
politic
be
allow
to
them
,
and
perhaps
some
influence
also
.
<EOS>
afterwards
Mr.
Palliser
himself
come
in
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
however
,
be
most
strike
by
find
that
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
be
there
,
and
that
Mr.
Kennedy
be
not
.
<EOS>
in
regard
to
Mr.
Kennedy
,
he
be
quite
sure
that
have
such
a
meeting
take
place
before
Lady
Laura
's
marriage
,
Mr.
Kennedy
would
have
be
present
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
speak
to
you
as
we
go
away
,
"
say
Phineas
,
whisper
a
word
into
Fitzgibbon
's
ear
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
leave
note
for
you
all
about
the
town
.
"
<EOS>
"
not
a
duel
,
I
hope
,
"
say
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
how
pleasant
it
be
,
 
that
meeting
;
or
would
have
be
have
<EOS>
there
not
be
that
nightmare
on
his
breast
!
<EOS>
They
all
talk
as
though
there
be
perfect
accord
between
them
and
perfect
confidence
.
<EOS>
there

daughter
of
some
of
England
's
high
noble

<EOS>
and
Phineas
Finn

throw
back
,
now
and
again
,
a
thought
to
Killaloe
,
find
himself
among
them
as
one
of
themselves
.
<EOS>
how
could
any
Mr.
Low
say
that
he
be
wrong
?
  
<EOS>
on
a
sofa
near
to
him
,
so
that
he
could
almost
touch
her
foot
with
his
,
be
sit
Violet
Effingham
,
and
as
he
lean
over
from
his
chair
discuss
some
point
in
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
with
that
most
inveterate
politician
,
Lady
Glencora
,
<EOS>
Violet
look
into
his
face
and
smile
.
<EOS>
oh
heaven
!
<EOS>
if
Lord
Chiltern
and
he
may
only
toss
up
as
to
which
of
them
should
go
to
Patagonia
and
remain
there
for
the
next
ten
year
,
and
which
should
have
Violet
Effingham
for
a
wife
in
London
!
  
<EOS>
"
come
along
,
Phineas
,
if
you
mean
to
come
,
"
say
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
of
course
bind
to
go
,
though
Lady
Glencora
be
still
talk
Radicalism
,
and
Violet
Effingham
be
still
smile
ineffably
.
     
<EOS>
the
Duel
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
be
a
duel
;
 
bedad
I
do
,
"
say
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
stand
at
the
corner
of
Orchard
Street
and
Oxford
Street
,
when
Phineas
have
half
tell
his
story
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
of
it
from
the
tone
of
your
voice
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
let
it
come
off
,
that
be
all
;
 
not
if
we
can
help
it
.
"
<EOS>
then
Phineas
be
allow
to
proceed
and
finish
his
story
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
any
way
out
of
it
;
I
do
not
,
indeed
,
"
say
Laurence
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
Phineas
have
come
to
think
that
the
duel
be
in
very
truth
the
good
way
out
of
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bad
way
out
,
but
then
it
be
a
way
;
 
and
he
could
not
see
any
other
.
"
<EOS>
as
for
ill
treat
him
,
that
be
nonsense
,
"
say
Laurence
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
girl
to
do
,
if
one
fellow
may
not
come
on
as
soon
as
another
fellow
be
down
?
<EOS>
but
then
,
you
see
,
a
fellow
never
know
when
he
be
down
himself
,
and
therefore
he
think
that
he
be
ill
used
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
now
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
we
could
not
do
it
on
the
sly
,
 
unless
one
of
you
be
stupid
enough
to
hit
the
other
in
an
awkward
place
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
certain
of
your
hand
now
,
the
right
shoulder
be
the
good
spot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
feel
very
certain
that
he
would
not
hit
Lord
Chiltern
in
an
awkward
place
,
although
he
be
by
no
mean
sure
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
let
come
what
may
,
he
would
not
aim
at
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
but
of
this
he
have
think
it
proper
to
say
nothing
to
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
and
the
duel
do
come
off
on
the
sly
.
<EOS>
the
meeting
in
the
drawing
-
room
in
Portman
Square
,
of
which
mention
be
make
in
the
last
chapter
,
take
place
on
a
Wednesday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
on
the
Thursday
,
Friday
,
Monday
,
and
Tuesday
follow
,
the
great
debate
on
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
be
continue
,
and
at
three
on
the
Tuesday
night
the
House
divide
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
majority
in
favour
of
the
Ministers
,
not
large
enough
to
permit
them
to
claim
a
triumph
for
their
party
,
or
even
an
ovation
for
themselves
;
but
still
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
send
their
bill
into
committee
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
and
Mr.
Turnbull
have
again
join
their
force
together
in
opposition
to
the
ministerial
measure
.
<EOS>
on
the
Thursday
Phineas
have
show
himself
in
the
House
,
but
during
the
remainder
of
this
interesting
period
he
be
absent
from
his
place
,
nor
be
he
see
at
the
club
,
nor
do
any
man
know
of
his
whereabouts
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
be
the
first
to
miss
him
with
any
real
sense
of
his
absence
.
<EOS>
She
would
now
go
to
Portman
Square
on
the
afternoon
of
every
Sunday
,
 
at
which
time
her
husband
be
attend
the
second
service
of
his
church
,
 
<EOS>
and
there
she
would
receive
those
whom
she
call
her
father
's
guest
.
<EOS>
but
as
her
father
be
never
there
on
the
Sundays
,
and
as
these
gathering
have
be
create
by
herself
,
the
reader
will
probably
think
that
she
be
obey
her
husband
's
behest
in
regard
to
the
Sabbath
after
a
very
indifferent
fashion
.
<EOS>
the
reader
may
be
quite
sure
,
however
,
that
Mr.
Kennedy
know
well
what
be
be
do
in
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
Lady
Laura
's
fault
,
she
do
not
commit
the
fault
of
disobey
her
husband
in
secret
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
probably
,
a
few
word
on
the
subject
;
but
we
need
not
go
very
closely
into
that
matter
at
the
present
moment
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Sunday
which
afford
some
rest
in
the
middle
of
the
great
Reform
debate
Lady
Laura
ask
for
Mr.
Finn
,
and
no
one
could
answer
her
question
.
<EOS>
and
then
it
be
remember
that
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
be
also
absent
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
know
nothing
of
Phineas
,
 
have
hear
nothing
;
but
be
able
to
say
that
Fitzgibbon
have
be
with
Mr.
Ratler
,
the
patronage
secretary
and
liberal
whip
,
early
on
Thursday
,
express
his
intention
of
absent
himself
for
two
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
have
be
wroth
,
bid
him
remain
at
his
duty
,
and
point
out
to
him
the
great
importance
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
then
Barrington
Erle
quote
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
My
boy
,
"
say
Laurence
to
poor
Ratler
,
"
the
path
of
duty
lead
but
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
all
the
same
;
I
will
be
in
at
the
death
,
Ratler
,
my
boy
,
as
sure
as
the
sun
be
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
"
not
ten
minute
after
the
telling
of
this
little
story
,
Fitzgibbon
enter
the
room
in
Portman
Square
,
and
Lady
Laura
at
once
ask
him
after
Phineas
.
"
<EOS>
Bedad
,
Lady
Laura
,
I
have
be
out
of
town
myself
for
two
day
,
and
I
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Finn
have
not
be
with
you
,
then
?
"
  
"
with
me
!
<EOS>
no
,
 
not
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
job
of
business
of
my
own
which
take
me
over
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
and
have
Phinny
flee
too
?
<EOS>
poor
Ratler
!
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
it
be
not
an
asylum
<EOS>
he
be
in
before
the
session
be
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
certainly
possess
the
rare
accomplishment
of
tell
a
lie
with
a
good
grace
.
<EOS>
have
any
man
call
him
a
liar
he
would
have
consider
himself
to
be
not
only
insult
,
but
injure
also
.
<EOS>
He
believe
himself
to
be
a
man
of
truth
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
in
his
estimation
certain
subject
on
which
a
man
may
depart
as
wide
as
the
pole
be
asunder
from
truth
without
subject
himself
to
any
ignominy
for
falsehood
.
<EOS>
in
deal
with
a
tradesman
as
to
his
debt
,
or
with
a
rival
as
to
a
lady
,
or
with
any
man
or
woman
in
defence
of
a
lady
's
character
,
or
in
any
such
matter
as
that
of
a
duel
,
Laurence
believe
that
a
gentleman
be
bind
to
lie
,
and
that
he
would
be
no
gentleman
if
he
hesitate
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
not
the
slight
prick
of
conscience
disturb
him
when
he
tell
Lady
Laura
that
he
have
be
in
Paris
,
and
that
he
know
nothing
of
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
during
the
last
day
or
two
he
have
be
in
flander
,
and
not
in
Paris
,
and
have
stand
as
second
with
his
friend
Phineas
on
the
sand
at
Blankenberg
,
a
little
fishing
-
town
some
twelve
mile
distant
from
bruge
,
and
have
leave
his
friend
since
that
at
an
hotel
at
Ostend
,
 
with
a
wound
just
under
the
shoulder
,
from
which
a
bullet
have
be
extract
.
  
<EOS>
the
manner
of
the
meeting
have
be
in
this
wise
.
<EOS>
Captain
Colepepper
and
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
have
hold
their
meeting
,
and
at
this
meeting
Laurence
have
take
certain
standing
-
ground
on
behalf
of
his
friend
,
and
in
obedience
to
his
friend
's
positive
instruction
;
 
which
be
this
,
that
his
friend
could
not
abandon
his
right
of
address
the
young
lady
,
should
he
hereafter
ever
think
fit
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
let
that
be
grant
,
and
Laurence
would
do
anything
.
<EOS>
but
then
that
could
not
be
grant
,
and
Laurence
could
only
shrug
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
nor
would
Laurence
admit
that
his
friend
have
be
false
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
question
lie
in
a
nutshell
,
"
say
Laurence
,
with
that
sweet
Connaught
brogue
which
always
come
to
him
when
he
desire
to
be
effective
;
 
"
here
it
be
.
<EOS>
one
gentleman
tell
another
that
he
be
sweet
upon
a
young
lady
,
but
that
the
young
lady
have
refuse
him
,
and
always
will
refuse
him
,
for
ever
and
ever
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
truth
anyhow
.
<EOS>
be
the
second
gentleman
bind
by
that
not
to
address
the
young
lady
?
<EOS>
I
say
he
be
not
bind
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
d
 
d
hard
tratement
,
Captain
Colepepper
,
if
a
man
's
mouth
and
all
the
ardent
affection
of
his
heart
be
to
be
stop
in
that
manner
!
<EOS>
by
jase
,
I
do
not
know
who
'd
like
to
be
the
friend
of
any
man
<EOS>
if
that
be
to
be
the
way
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Colepepper
be
not
very
good
at
an
argument
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
would
better
see
each
other
,
"
say
Colepepper
,
pull
his
thick
grey
moustache
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
choose
to
have
it
so
,
so
be
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
the
hard
thing
in
the
world
;
 
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
then
they
put
their
head
together
in
the
most
friendly
way
,
and
declare
that
the
affair
should
,
if
possible
,
be
keep
private
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Thursday
night
Lord
Chiltern
and
Captain
Colepepper
go
over
by
Calais
and
Lille
to
Bruges
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
with
his
friend
Dr.
O'Shaughnessy
,
cross
by
the
direct
boat
from
Dover
to
Ostend
.
<EOS>
Phineas
go
to
Ostend
by
Dover
and
Calais
,
but
he
take
the
day
route
on
Friday
.
<EOS>
It
have
all
be
arrange
among
them
,
so
that
there
may
be
no
suspicion
as
to
the
job
in
hand
.
<EOS>
even
O'Shaughnessy
and
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
have
leave
London
by
separate
train
.
<EOS>
They
meet
on
the
sand
at
Blankenberg
about
nine
o'clock
on
the
Saturday
morning
,
have
reach
that
village
in
different
vehicle
from
Ostend
and
Bruges
,
and
have
meet
quite
unobserved
amidst
the
sand
-
heap
.
<EOS>
but
one
shot
have
be
exchange
,
and
Phineas
have
be
wound
in
the
right
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
have
propose
to
exchange
another
shot
with
his
left
hand
,
declare
his
capability
of
shoot
quite
as
well
with
the
left
as
with
the
right
;
but
to
this
both
Colepepper
and
Fitzgibbon
have
object
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
have
offer
to
shake
hand
with
his
late
friend
in
a
true
spirit
of
friendship
,
if
only
his
late
friend
would
say
that
he
do
not
intend
to
prosecute
his
suit
with
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
in
all
these
dispute
the
young
lady
's
name
be
never
mention
.
<EOS>
Phineas
indeed
have
not
once
name
Violet
to
Fitzgibbon
,
speak
of
her
always
as
the
lady
in
question
;
and
though
Laurence
correctly
surmise
the
identity
of
the
young
lady
,
he
never
hint
that
he
have
even
guess
her
name
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
Lord
Chiltern
have
be
so
wary
when
alone
with
Captain
Colepepper
;
but
then
Lord
Chiltern
be
,
when
he
speak
at
all
,
a
very
plain
-
spoken
man
.
<EOS>
of
course
his
lordship
's
late
friend
Phineas
would
give
no
such
pledge
,
and
therefore
Lord
Chiltern
move
off
the
ground
and
back
to
Blankenberg
and
Bruges
,
and
into
Brussels
,
in
still
live
enmity
with
our
hero
.
<EOS>
Laurence
and
the
doctor
take
Phineas
back
to
Ostend
,
and
though
the
bullet
be
then
in
his
shoulder
,
Phineas
make
his
way
through
Blankenberg
after
such
a
fashion
that
no
one
there
know
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
not
a
live
soul
,
except
the
five
concerned
,
be
at
that
time
aware
that
a
duel
have
be
fight
among
the
sand
-
hill
.
  
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
make
his
way
to
Dover
by
the
Saturday
night
's
boat
,
and
be
able
to
show
himself
in
Portman
Square
on
the
Sunday
.
"
<EOS>
know
anything
about
Phinny
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
afterwards
to
Barrington
Erle
,
in
answer
to
an
inquiry
from
that
anxious
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
not
a
word
!
<EOS>
I
think
you
would
better
send
the
town
-
cri
round
after
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Barrington
,
however
,
do
not
feel
quite
so
well
assured
of
Fitzgibbon
's
truth
as
Lady
Laura
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
O'Shaughnessy
remain
during
the
Sunday
and
Monday
at
Ostend
with
his
patient
,
and
the
people
at
the
inn
only
know
that
Mr.
Finn
have
sprain
his
shoulder
badly
;
and
on
the
Tuesday
they
come
back
to
London
again
,
via
Calais
and
Dover
.
<EOS>
no
bone
have
be
break
,
and
Phineas
,
though
his
shoulder
be
very
painful
,
bore
the
journey
well
.
<EOS>
O'Shaughnessy
have
receive
a
telegram
on
the
Monday
,
tell
him
that
the
division
would
certainly
take
place
on
the
Tuesday
,
 
and
on
the
Tuesday
,
at
about
ten
in
the
evening
,
Phineas
go
down
to
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
---
,
you
be
here
,
"
say
Ratler
,
take
hold
of
him
with
an
affection
that
be
too
warm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
I
be
here
,
"
say
Phineas
,
wince
in
agony
;
"
but
be
a
little
careful
<EOS>
,
there
be
a
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
down
in

you

Ratler

"
yes
;
 
I
will

I
have
come
up
for
the
purpose

I
hope
it

not
be
very
late

"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
both
Daubeny
and
Gresham
to
speak
yet

and
at

three
other

<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
it
will
be
much
before
three

<EOS>
but
you
be
all
right
now
.
<EOS>
You
can
go
down
and
smoke
if
you
like

"
<EOS>
in
this
way
Phineas
Finn
speak
in
the
debate
,
and
hear
the
end
of
it
,
vote
for
his
party
,
and
fight
his
duel
with
Lord
Chiltern
in
the
middle
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
go
and
sit
on
a
well
-
cushion
bench
in
the
smoking
-
room
,
and
then
be
interrogate
by
many
of
his
friend
as
to
his
mysterious
absence
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
he
say
,
be
down
in
Kent
,
and
have
have
an
accident
with
his
arm
,
by
which
he
have
be
confine
.
<EOS>
when
this
questioner
and
that
perceive
that
there
be
some
little
mystery
in
the
matter
,
the
questioner
do
not
push
their
question
,
but
simply
entertain
their
own
surmise
.
<EOS>
one
indiscreet
questioner
,
however
,
do
trouble
Phineas
sorely
,
declare
that
there
must
have
be
some
affair
in
which
a
woman
have
have
a
part
,
and
ask
after
the
young
lady
of
Kent
.
<EOS>
this
indiscreet
questioner
be
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
who
,
as
Phineas
think
,
carry
his
spirit
of
intrigue
a
little
too
far
.
<EOS>
Phineas
stay
and
vote
,
and
then
he
go
painfully
home
to
his
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
how
singular
would
it
be
if
this
affair
of
the
duel
should
pass
away
,
and
no
one
be
a
bit
the
wise
but
those
four
man
who
have
be
with
him
on
the
sand
at
Blankenberg
!
<EOS>
again
he
wonder
at
his
own
luck
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
himself
that
a
duel
with
Lord
Chiltern
must
create
a
quarrel
between
him
and
Lord
Chiltern
's
relation
,
and
also
between
him
and
Violet
Effingham
;
that
it
must
banish
him
from
his
comfortable
seat
for
Loughton
,
and
ruin
him
in
regard
to
his
political
prospect
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
have
fight
his
duel
,
and
be
back
in
town
,
 
and
the
thing
seem
to
have
be
a
thing
of
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
as
yet
see
Lady
Laura
or
Violet
,
but
he
have
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
they
both
be
as
much
in
the
dark
as
other
people
.
<EOS>
the
day
may
arrive
,
he
think
,
on
which
it
would
be
pleasant
for
him
to
tell
Violet
Effingham
what
have
occur
,
but
that
day
have
not
come
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Whither
Lord
Chiltern
have
go
,
or
what
Lord
Chiltern
intend
to
do
,
he
have
not
any
idea
;
but
he
imagine
that
he
should
soon
hear
something
of
her
brother
from
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
that
Lord
Chiltern
should
say
a
word
to
Lady
Laura
of
what
have
occur
,
 
or
to
any
other
person
in
the
world
,
 
he
do
not
in
the
least
suspect
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
man
more
likely
to
be
reticent
in
such
matter
than
Lord
Chiltern
,
 
or
more
sure
to
be
guide
by
an
almost
exaggerated
sense
of
what
honour
require
of
him
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
doubt
the
discretion
of
his
friend
Fitzgibbon
;
 
if
only
his
friend
may
not
damage
the
secret
by
be
too
discreet
.
<EOS>
of
the
silence
of
the
doctor
and
the
captain
he
be
by
no
means
equally
sure
;
but
even
though
they
should
gossip
,
the
gossip
would
take
so
long
a
time
in
ooze
out
and
become
recognise
information
,
as
to
have
lose
much
of
its
power
for
injure
him
.
<EOS>
be
Lady
Laura
to
hear
at
this
moment
that
he
have
be
over
to
Belgium
,
and
have
fight
a
duel
with
Lord
Chiltern
respect
Violet
<EOS>
,
she
would
probably
feel
herself
oblige
to
quarrel
with
him
;
but
no
such
obligation
would
rest
on
her
,
if
in
the
course
of
six
or
nine
month
she
should
gradually
have
become
aware
that
such
an
encounter
have
take
place
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
during
their
interview
at
the
room
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
have
say
a
word
to
him
about
the
seat
in
Parliament
;
 
have
express
some
opinion
that
as
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
be
interfere
with
the
view
of
the
standish
family
in
regard
to
Miss
Effingham
,
he
ought
not
to
keep
the
standish
seat
,
which
have
be
confer
upon
him
in
ignorance
of
any
such
intend
interference
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
think
of
this
,
could
not
remember
Lord
Chiltern
's
word
,
but
there
be
present
to
him
an
idea
that
such
have
be
their
purport
.
<EOS>
be
he
bind
,
in
circumstance
as
they
now
exist
,
to
give
up
Loughton
?
<EOS>
He
make
up
his
mind
that
he
be
not
so
bind
unless
Lord
Chiltern
should
demand
from
him
that
he
should
do
so
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
be
uneasy
in
his
position
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
true
that
the
seat
now
be
his
for
this
session
by
all
parliamentary
law
,
even
though
the
elector
themselves
may
wish
to
be
rid
of
him
,
and
that
Lord
Brentford
could
not
even
open
his
mouth
upon
the
matter
in
a
tone
more
loud
than
that
of
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
but
Phineas
,
feel
that
he
have
consent
to
accept
the
favour
of
a
corrupt
seat
from
Lord
Brentford
,
feel
also
that
he
be
bind
to
give
up
the
spoil
if
it
be
demand
from
him
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
demand
from
him
,
either
by
the
father
or
the
son
,
it
should
be
give
up
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
he
find
a
lead
article
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
devote
solely
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
during
the
late
debate
,
"
 
so
run
a
passage
in
the
lead
article
,
 
"
Mr.
Finn
,
Lord
Brentford
's
irish
nominee
for
his
pocket
-
borough
at
Loughton
,
do
at
last
manage
to
stand
on
his
leg
and
open
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
not
mistaken
,
this
be
Mr.
Finn
's
third
session
in
Parliament
,
and
hitherto
he
have
be
unable
to
articulate
three
sentence
,
though
he
have
on
more
than
one
occasion
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
for
what
special
merit
this
young
man
have
be
select
for
aristocratic
patronage
we
do
not
know
,
 
but
that
there
must
be
some
merit
recognisable
by
aristocratic
eye
,
we
surmise
.
<EOS>
three
year
ago
he
be
a
raw
young
Irishman
,
live
in
London
as
Irishmen
only
know
how
to
live
,
earn
nothing
,
and
apparently
without
mean
;
and
then
suddenly
he
burst
out
as
a
member
of
Parliament
and
as
the
friend
of
Cabinet
Ministers
.
<EOS>
the
possession
of
one
good
gift
must
be
accede
to
the
honourable
member
for
Loughton
,
 
he
be
a
handsome
young
man
,
and
look
to
be
as
strong
as
a
coal
-
porter
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
that
his
promotion
have
spring
from
this
?
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
we
should
like
to
know
where
he
have
be
during
his
late
mysterious
absence
from
Parliament
,
and
in
what
way
he
come
by
the
wound
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
even
handsome
young
member
of
Parliament
,
fête
by
titled
lady
and
their
rich
lord
,
be
amenable
to
the
law
,
 
to
the
law
of
this
country
,
and
to
the
law
of
any
other
which
it
may
suit
them
to
visit
for
a
while
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
infamous
scoundrel
!
"
say
Phineas
to
himself
,
as
he
read
this
.
<EOS>
"
vile
,
low
,
disreputable
blackguard
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
be
clear
enough
,
however
,
that
Quintus
Slide
have
find
out
something
of
his
secret
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
his
only
hope
would
rest
on
the
fact
that
his
friend
be
not
likely
to
see
the
column
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
be
tell
 
by
the
time
that
Mr.
Mildmay
's
great
bill
be
go
into
committee
Phineas
be
able
to
move
about
London
in
comfort
,
 
with
his
arm
,
however
,
still
in
a
sling
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
nothing
more
about
him
and
his
wound
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
and
he
be
begin
to
hope
that
that
nuisance
would
also
be
allow
to
die
away
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
Lady
Laura
,
 
have
dine
in
Grosvenor
Place
,
where
he
have
be
pet
to
his
heart
's
content
.
<EOS>
His
dinner
have
be
cut
up
for
him
,
and
his
wound
have
be
treat
with
the
tender
sympathy
.
<EOS>
and
,
singular
to
say
,
no
question
be
ask
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
to
Kent
and
have
come
by
an
accident
.
<EOS>
no
more
than
that
be
tell
,
and
his
dear
sympathising
friend
be
content
to
receive
so
much
information
,
and
to
ask
for
no
more
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
as
yet
see
Violet
Effingham
,
and
he
be
begin
to
think
that
this
romance
about
Violet
may
as
well
be
bring
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
,
however
,
as
yet
be
able
to
go
into
crowded
room
,
and
unless
he
go
out
to
large
party
he
could
not
be
sure
that
he
would
meet
Miss
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
resolve
that
he
would
tell
Lady
Laura
the
whole
truth
,
 
not
the
truth
about
the
duel
,
but
the
truth
about
Violet
Effingham
,
and
ask
for
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
when
make
this
resolution
,
I
think
that
he
must
have
forget
much
that
he
have
learn
of
his
friend
's
character
;
and
by
make
it
,
I
think
that
he
show
also
that
he
have
not
learn
as
much
as
his
opportunity
may
have
teach
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
Lady
Laura
's
obstinacy
of
purpose
,
he
know
her
devotion
to
her
brother
,
and
he
know
also
how
desirous
she
have
be
that
her
brother
should
win
Violet
Effingham
for
himself
.
<EOS>
this
knowledge
should
,
I
think
,
have
suffice
to
show
him
how
improbable
it
be
that
Lady
Laura
should
assist
him
in
his
enterprise
.
<EOS>
but
beyond
all
this
be
the
fact
,
 
a
fact
as
to
the
consequence
of
which
Phineas
himself
be
entirely
blind
,
beautifully
ignorant
,
 
that
Lady
Laura
have
once
condescend
to
love
himself
.
<EOS>
Nay
;
 
she
have
go
farther
than
this
,
and
have
venture
to
tell
him
,
even
after
her
marriage
,
that
the
remembrance
of
some
feeling
that
have
once
dwell
in
her
heart
in
regard
to
him
be
still
a
danger
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
warn
him
from
Loughlinter
,
and
then
have
receive
him
in
London
;
 
and
now
he
select
her
as
his
confidante
in
this
love
affair
!
<EOS>
have
he
not
be
beautifully
ignorant
and
most
modestly
blind
,
he
would
surely
have
place
his
confidence
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
ever
confess
to
herself
the
existence
of
a
vicious
passion
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
indeed
,
learn
to
tell
herself
that
she
could
not
love
her
husband
;
and
once
,
in
the
excitement
of
such
silent
announcement
to
herself
,
she
have
ask
herself
whether
her
heart
be
quite
a
blank
,
and
have
answer
herself
by
desire
Phineas
Finn
to
absent
himself
from
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
during
all
the
subsequent
winter
she
have
scourge
herself
inwardly
for
her
own
imprudence
,
her
quite
unnecessary
folly
in
so
do
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
could
not
she
,
Laura
Standish
,
who
from
her
early
year
of
girlish
womanhood
have
resolve
that
she
would
use
the
world
as
man
use
it
,
and
not
as
woman
do
,
 
could
not
she
have
feel
the
slight
shock
of
a
pass
tenderness
for
a
handsome
youth
without
allow
the
feeling
to
be
a
rock
before
her
big
enough
and
sharp
enough
for
the
destruction
of
her
entire
barque
?
<EOS>
Could
not
she
command
,
if
not
her
heart
,
at
any
rate
her
mind
,
so
that
she
may
safely
assure
herself
that
,
whether
this
man
or
any
man
be
here
or
there
,
her
course
would
be
unaltered
?
<EOS>
what
though
Phineas
Finn
have
be
in
the
same
house
with
her
throughout
all
the
winter
,
could
not
she
have
so
live
with
him
on
term
of
friendship
,
that
every
deed
and
word
and
look
of
her
friendship
may
have
be
open
to
her
husband
,
 
or
open
to
all
the
world
?
<EOS>
She
could
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
tell
herself
that
that
be
not
,
 
need
not
have
be
her
great
calamity
.
<EOS>
whether
she
could
endure
the
dull
,
monotonous
control
of
her
slow
but
imperious
lord
,
 
or
whether
she
must
not
rather
tell
him
that
it
be
not
to
be
endure
,
 
that
be
her
trouble
.
<EOS>
so
she
tell
herself
,
and
again
admit
Phineas
to
her
intimacy
in
London
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
Phineas
,
have
he
not
be
beautifully
ignorant
and
most
blind
to
his
own
achievement
,
would
not
have
expect
from
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
assistance
with
Miss
Violet
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
know
when
to
find
Lady
Laura
alone
,
and
he
come
upon
her
one
day
at
the
favourable
hour
.
<EOS>
the
two
first
clause
of
the
bill
have
be
pass
after
twenty
fight
and
endless
division
.
<EOS>
two
point
have
be
settle
,
as
to
which
,
however
,
Mr.
Gresham
have
be
drive
to
give
way
so
far
and
to
yield
so
much
,
that
man
declare
that
such
a
bill
as
the
Government
could
consent
to
call
its
own
could
never
be
pass
by
that
Parliament
in
that
session
.
<EOS>
immediately
on
his
entrance
into
her
room
Lady
Laura
begin
about
the
third
clause
.
<EOS>
Would
the
House
let
Mr.
Gresham
have
his
way
about
the
 
?
<EOS>
Phineas
stop
her
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
have
come
to
you
in
a
private
trouble
,
and
I
want
you
to
drop
politic
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
you
for
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
private
trouble
,
Mr.
Finn
!
<EOS>
be
it
serious
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
serious
,
 
but
it
be
no
trouble
of
the
kind
of
which
you
be

it
be
serious
enough
to
take
up

Can
I
help
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
can

whether
you

I

You
have
be

so
would
Mr.

<EOS>

here

what
be
it
,
Mr.
Finn

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
,
 
in
plain
language
,
I
do
not
know
how
to
put
my
story
into
word
that
shall
fit
it

<EOS>
I
love
Violet
Effingham

<EOS>
Will
you
help
me
to
win
her
to
be
my
wife

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
love
Violet
Effingham
!
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
and
as
she
speak
the
look
of
her
countenance
towards
him
be
so
change
that
he
become
at
once
aware
that
from
her
no
assistance
may
be
expect
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
not
open
in
any
degree
to
the
second
reason
above
give
for
Lady
Laura
's
opposition
to
his
wish
,
but
he
instantly
perceive
that
she
would
still
cling
to
that
destination
of
Violet
's
hand
which
have
for
year
past
<EOS>
be
the
favourite
scheme
of
her
life

have
you
not
always
know

Mr.

what
have
be
our
hope
for
Violet

"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
though
he
have
perceive
his
mistake
,
feel
that
he
must
go
on
with
his
cause
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
must
know
his
wish
sooner
or
later
,
and
it
be
as
well
that
she
should
learn
them
in
this
way
as
in
any
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
 
but
I
have
know
also
,
from
your
brother
's
own
lip
,
 
and
indeed
from
yours
also
,
Lady
Laura
,
 
that
Chiltern
have
be
three
time
refuse
by
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

what
do
that
matter

<EOS>
do
man
never
ask
more
than
three
time

must
I
be
debar
for

hopeless
suit

<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
 
you
of
all
man

"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
so
,
Lady

<EOS>
"
  
"
because
in
this

you
have
be

We
have
tell

everything

trust
to
you

We
have
believe
in

We
have

that
with

we

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
these
word
be
very
bitter
to
Phineas
,
and
yet
when
he
have
write
his
letter
at
Loughton
,
he
have
intend
to
be
so
perfectly
honest
,
chivalrously
honest
!
<EOS>
now
Lady
Laura
speak
to
him
and
look
at
him
as
though
he
have
be
most
basely
false
 
most
untrue
to
that
noble
friendship
which
have
be
lavish
upon
him
by
all
her
family
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
would
become
the
prey
of
her
most
injurious
thought
unless
he
could
fully
explain
his
idea
,
and
he
feel
,
also
,
that
the
circumstance
do
not
admit
of
his
explain
them
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
take
up
the
argument
on
Violet
's
side
,
and
show
how
unfair
it
would
be
to
her
that
she
should
be
debar
from
the
homage
due
to
her
by
any
man
who
really
love
her
,
because
Lord
Chiltern
choose
to
think
that
he
still
have
a
claim
,
 
or
at
any
rate
a
chance
.
<EOS>
and
Phineas
know
well
of
himself

think
that
he
know
well

that
he
would
not
have
interfere

there
be
any
chance
for
Lord
Chiltern

<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
have
himself
tell
him
more
than
once
that
there
be
no
such
chance

<EOS>
how
be
he
to
explain
all
this
to
Lady
Laura

"
<EOS>
Mr.

can
hardly

<EOS>
"
listen
to
me

for
a
moment

"
  
"
certainly
,
I
will
listen

<EOS>
but
that
you
should
come
to
me
for
assistance
!
<EOS>
I
can
not

man
sometimes
become
harder
than

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

that
I
be
hard

"
<EOS>
poor
blind
fool
!
<EOS>
He
be
still
think
only
of
Violet
,
and
of
the
accusation
make
against
him
that
he
be
untrue
to
his
friendship
for
Lord
Chiltern

<EOS>
of
that
other
accusation
which
could
not
be
express
in
open
word
he
understand
nothing
,
 
nothing
at
all
as
yet

<EOS>
"

false

capable
of
receive
no

outside

<EOS>
"
oh
,
Lady

do
not

true
I
be

my

<EOS>
"
and
how
do
you
show
it
?
 
<EOS>
by
come
in
between
Oswald
and
the
only
mean
that
be
open
to
us
of
reconcile
him
to
his
father
;
 
mean
that
have
be
explain
to
you
exactly
as
though
you
have
be
one
of
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Oswald
have
treat
you
as
a
brother
in
the
matter
,
tell
you
everything
,
and
this
be
the
way
you
would
repay
him
for
his
confidence
!

"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
help
it
,
that
I
have
learn
to
love
this
girl
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
 
you
can
help
it

<EOS>
what
if
she
have
be
Oswald
's
wife
;
 
would
you
have
love
her
then
?
<EOS>
do
you
speak
of
love
a
woman
as
if
it
be
an
affair
of
fate
,
over
which
you
have
no
control
?
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
your
passion
be
so
strong
as
that
.
<EOS>
You
have
better
put
aside
your
love
for
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
I
feel
assured
that
it
will
never
hurt
you
.
"
<EOS>
then
some
remembrance
of
what
have
pass
between
him
and
Lady
Laura
Standish
near
the
fall
of
the
Linter
,
when
he
first
visit
Scotland
,
come
across
his
mind
.
"
<EOS>
believe
me
,
"
she
say
with
a
smile
,
"
this
little
wound
in
your
heart
will
soon
be
cure
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stand
silent
before
her
,
look
away
from
her
,
think
over
it
all
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
have
believe
himself
to
be
violently
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
,
and
yet
when
he
have
just
now
enter
her
drawing
-
room
,
he
have
almost
forget
that
there
have
be
such
a
passage
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
believe
that
she
have
forget
it
,
 
even
though
she
have
counsel
him
not
to
come
to
Loughlinter
within
the
last
nine
month
!
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
boy
then
,
and
have
not
know
himself
;
 
but
now
he
be
a
man
,
and
be
proud
of
the
intensity
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
there
come
upon
him
some
pass
throb
of
pain
from
his
shoulder
,
remind
him
of
the
duel
,
and
he
be
proud
also
of
that
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
willing
to
risk
everything
,
 
life
,
prospect
,
and
position
,
 
sooner
than
abandon
the
slight
hope
which
be
his
of
possess
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
be
tell
that
this
wound
in
his
heart
would
soon
be
cure
,
and
be
tell
so
by
a
woman
to
whom
he
have
once
sing
a
song
of
another
passion
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
hard
to
answer
a
woman
in
such
circumstance
,
because
her
womanhood
give
her
so
strong
a
ground
of
vantage
!
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
may
venture
to
throw
in
his
tooth
the
fickleness
of
his
heart
,
but
he
could
not
in
reply
tell
her
that
to
change
a
love
be
well
than
to
marry
without
love
,
 
that
to
be
capable
of
such
a
change
show
no
such
inferiority
of
nature
as
do
the
capacity
for
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
could
hit
him
with
her
argument
;
but
he
could
only
remember
his
,
and
think
how
violent
may
be
the
blow
he
could
inflict
,
 
if
it
be
not
that
she
be
a
woman
,
and
therefore
guard
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
help
me
then
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
when
they
have
both
be
silent
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
help
you
?
<EOS>
how
should
I
help
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
no
other
help
than
this
,
 
that
I
may
have
have
an
opportunity
of
meeting
Violet
here
,
and
of
get
from
her
some
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
have
the
question
then
never
be
ask
already

"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
to
this
Phineas
make
no
immediate
reply
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
why
he
should
show
his
whole
hand
to
an
adversary
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
not
go
to
Lady
Baldock
's
house
?

<EOS>
continue
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
admit
there

<EOS>
You
know
Lady
Baldock

<EOS>
go
and
ask
her
to
stand
your
friend
with
her
niece

<EOS>
see
what
she
will
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
understand
these
matter

that
be
the
fair

honourable
,
open
way

gentleman
be

overture

<EOS>
"
I
would
make
mine
to
none
but
to
herself

"
say
Phineas

<EOS>
"
then
why
have
you
make
it
to
me
,
sir
?
"
demand
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
you
as
I
would
to
my
sister

<EOS>
"
Your
sister

<EOS>
Psha
!

I
be
not
your

be
I
so
<EOS>
,
should
I
fail
to
remember
that
I
have
a
dearer
brother
to
whom
my
faith
be
pledge
.
<EOS>
look
here
.
<EOS>
within
the
last
three
week
Oswald
have
sacrifice
everything
to
his
father
,
because
he
be
determine
that
Mr.
Kennedy
should
have
the
money
which
he
think
be
due
to
my
husband
.
<EOS>
He
have
enable
my
father
to
do
what
he
will
with
Saulsby

<EOS>
Papa
will
never

him

I
know
that

hard
as

be
with
him

he
will
never
hurt
Oswald
's

papa
be
too
proud
to
do
that

<EOS>
Violet
have
hear
what
Oswald
have
do
;
and
now
that
he
have
nothing
of
his
own
to
offer
her
for
the
future
but
his
bare
title
,
now
that
he
have
give
papa
power
to
do
what
he
will
with
the
property
,
I
believe
that
she
would
accept
him
instantly

that
be
her
disposition

<EOS>
Phineas
again
pause
a
moment
before
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
let
him
try

he
say

bide
my

I
confess
that
I

<EOS>
if
there
be
no
chance

my
right
be
as
good
as
that
of
any
other

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
this
which
make
Lady
Laura
feel
that
she
could
not
maintain
her
hostility
against
this
man
on
behalf
of
her
brother
;
 
and
yet
she
could
not
force
herself
to
be
other
than
hostile
to
him
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
sore
,
and
it
be
he
that
have
make
it
sore
.
<EOS>
She
have
lecture
herself
,
school
herself
with
mental
sackcloth
and
ashe
,
rebuke
herself
with
heavy
censure
from
day
to
day
,
because
she
have
find
herself
to
be
in
danger
of
regard
this
man
with
a
perilous
love
;
and
she
have
be
constant
in
this
work
of
penance
till
she
have
be
able
to
assure
herself
that
the
sackcloth
and
ashe
have
do
their
work
,
and
that
the
danger
be
past
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
him
still
and
love
him
well
,
"
she
have
say
to
herself
with
something
almost
of
triumph
,
"
but
I
have
cease
to
think
of
him
as
one
who
may
have
be
my
lover

<EOS>
and
yet
she
be
now
sick
and
sore
,
almost
beside
herself
with
the
agony
of
the
wound
,
because
this
man
whom
she
have
be
able
to
throw
aside
from
her
heart
have
also
be
able
so
to
throw
her
aside
.
<EOS>
and
she
feel
herself
constrain
to
rebuke
him
with
what
bitter
word
she
may
use
.
<EOS>
She
have
feel
it
easy
to
do
this
at
first
,
on
her
brother
's
score
.
<EOS>
She
have
accuse
him
of
treachery
to
his
friendship
,
 
both
as
to
Oswald
and
as
to
herself

<EOS>
on
that
she
could
say
cut
word
without
subject
herself
to
suspicion
even
from
herself

<EOS>
but
now
this
power
be
take
away
from
her
,
and
still
she
wish
to
wound
him

<EOS>
She
desire
to
taunt
him
with
his
old
fickleness

yet
to
subject
herself
to
no
imputation

what
give
you
any

simply
the
right

yet
you
come

understand
it
all
now
as
he
listen
to
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
and
look
into
the
line
of
her
face
.
<EOS>
there
be
write
there
plainly
enough
<EOS>
that
spretæ
injuria
formæ
of
which
she
herself
be
conscious
,
but
only
conscious
.
<EOS>
even
his
eye
,
blind
as
he
have
be
,
be
open
,
 
and
he
know
that
he
have
be
a
fool
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
that
I
come
to
you
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
be
well
that
you
should
not
have
do
so
,
"
she
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
yet
perhaps
it
be
well
that
there
should
be
no
misunderstanding
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
must
tell
my
brother
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
but
for
a
moment
,
and
then
he
answer
her
with
a
sharp
voice
,
"
He
have
be
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
who
tell
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
write
to
him
the
moment
that
I
know
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
I
owe
it
to
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
my
letter
miss
him
,
and
he
only
learn
it
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
see
him
since
?
"
  
"
yes
;
 
I
have
see
him
.
"
  
"
and
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
how
do
he
take
it
?
<EOS>
do
he
bear
it
from
you
quietly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
;
"
and
Phineas
smile
as
he
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
,
Mr.
Finn
;
what
happen
?
<EOS>
what
be
to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
be
to

<EOS>
everything
have
be
do

<EOS>
I
may
as
well
tell
you
all
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
that
for
the
sake
of
me
,
as
well
as
of
your
brother
,
you
will
keep
our
secret

<EOS>
He
require
that
I
should
either
give
up
my
suit
,
or
that
I
should
,
 
fight
him
.
<EOS>
as
I
could
not
comply
with
the
one
request
,
I
find
myself
bind
to
comply
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
there
have
be
a
duel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
there
have
be
a
duel
.
<EOS>
We
go
over
to
Belgium
,
and
it
be
soon
settle
.
<EOS>
He
wound
me
here
in
the
arm
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
you
have
kill
him
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
Lady
Laura
,
would
have
be
a
misfortune
so
terrible
that
I
be
bind
to
prevent
it
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
pause
again
,
regret
what
he
have
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
surprise
me
,
Lady
Laura
,
into
an
answer
that
I
should
not
have
make
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
sure
,
 
may
I
not
,
 
that
my
word
will
not
go
beyond
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
you
may
be
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
this
she
say
plaintively
,
with
a
tone
of
voice
and
demeanour
of
body
altogether
different
from
that
which
she
lately
bear
.
<EOS>
neither
of
them
know
what
be
take
place
between
them
;
but
she
be
,
in
truth
,
gradually
submit
herself
again
to
this
man
's
influence
.
<EOS>
though
she
rebuke
him
at
every
turn
for
what
he
say
,
for
what
he
have
do
,
for
what
he
propose
to
do
,
still
she
could
not
teach
herself
to
despise
him
,
or
even
to
cease
to
love
him
for
any
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
know
it
all
now
,
 
except
that
word
or
two
which
have
pass
between
Violet
and
Phineas
in
the
ride
of
Saulsby
Park
.
<EOS>
but
she
suspect
something
even
of
that
,
feel
sure
that
the
only
matter
on
which
Phineas
would
say
nothing
would
be
that
of
his
own
success
,
 
if
success
there
have
be
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
and
Oswald
have
quarrel
,
and
there
have
be
a
duel
.
<EOS>
that
be
why
you
be
away
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
why
I
be
away

"
  
<EOS>
"
how
wrong
of
you
,
 
how
very
wrong
!

have
he
be
,

kill

could
you

us
in

I

over
now

no

we
do
not
part

friend

have
go
there
to
fight
with
him
,
 
most
unwillingly
,
 
I
could
not
afterwards
promise
him
that
I
would
give
up
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
You
say
she
will
accept
him
now
.
<EOS>
let
him
come
and
try
.
"
<EOS>
She
have
nothing
further
to
say
,
 
no
other
argument
to
use
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
soreness
at
her
heart
still
present
to
her
,
make
her
wretched
,
instigate
her
to
hurt
him
if
she
know
how
to
do
so
,
in
spite
of
her
regard
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
she
feel
that
she
be
weak
and
powerless
.
<EOS>
She
have
shoot
her
arrow
at
him
,
 
all
but
one
,
 
and
if
she
use
that
,
its
poison
point
would
wound
herself
far
more
surely
than
it
would
touch
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
duel
be
very
silly
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
;
certainly
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
at
least
that
I
have
tell
you
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
you
should
be
glad

<EOS>
I
can
not

you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
say
nothing
to
Violet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
everything
that
I
can
say
in
Oswald
's
favour
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
of
the
duel
;
but
beyond
that
you
have
no
right
to
demand
my
secrecy
with
her
.
<EOS>
yes
;
you
have
better
go
,
Mr.
Finn
,
for
I
be
hardly
well
.
<EOS>
and
remember
this
,
 
if
you
can
forget
this
little
episode
about
Miss
Effingham
,
so
will
I
forget
it
also
;
and
so
will
Oswald
.
<EOS>
I
can
promise
for
him
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
smile
and
give
him
her
hand
,
and
he
go
.
  
<EOS>
She
rise
from
her
chair
as
he
leave
the
room
,
and
wait
till
she
hear
the
sound
of
the
great
door
close
behind
him
before
she
again
sit
down
.
<EOS>
then
,
when
he
be
go
,
 
when
she
be
sure
that
he
be
no
longer
there
with
her
in
the
same
house
,
 
she
lay
her
head
down
upon
the
arm
of
the
sofa
,
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
.
<EOS>
She
be
no
longer
angry
with
Phineas
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
further
longing
in
her
heart
for
revenge
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
now
desire
to
injure
him
,
though
she
have
do
so
as
long
as
he
be
with
her
.
<EOS>
nay
,
 
she
resolve
instantly
,
almost
instinctively
,
that
Lord
Brentford
must
know
nothing
of
all
this
,
lest
the
political
prospect
of
the
young
member
for
Loughton
should
be
injure
.
<EOS>
to
have
rebuke
him
,
to
rebuke
him
again
and
again
,
would
be
only
fair
,
 
would
at
least
be
womanly
;
but
she
would
protect
him
from
all
material
injury
as
far
as
her
power
of
protection
may
avail
.
<EOS>
and
why
be
she
weep
now
so
bitterly
?
<EOS>
of
course
she
ask
herself
,
as
she
rub
away
the
tear
with
her
hand
,
 
why
should
she
weep
?
<EOS>
She
be
not
weak
enough
to
tell
herself
that
she
be
weep
for
any
injury
that
have
be
do
to
Oswald
.
<EOS>
She
get
up
suddenly
from
the
sofa
,
and
push
away
her
hair
from
her
face
,
and
push
away
the
tear
from
her
cheek
,
and
then
clench
her
fist
as
she
hold
them
out
at
full
length
from
her
body
,
and
stand
,
look
up
with
her
eye
fix
upon
the
wall
.
"
<EOS>
ass
!
<EOS>
"
she
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
fool
!
<EOS>
Idiot

<EOS>
that
I
should
not

crush
it
into
nothing

have
do
with
it

<EOS>
why
should
he
not
have
her
?
<EOS>
after
all
,
he
be
well
than
Oswald

the
door
of
the
room

be
open

shake
her
head

uncourteous

beg
your
pardon

I
could
not

<EOS>
"
Laura

you
should
help
such
word
to
me

there
be
moment
,
Robert
,
when
even
a
married
woman
must
be
herself
rather
than
her
husband
's
wife

<EOS>
It
be
so
,
though
you
can
not

it

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
do
not
understand
it
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
make
a
woman
subject
to
you

so

may
have
all
the
outside

with

dog

may

secret
in

I

I
have
trouble

who
ruin

I
will
not
talk
about
it
any
more

will
not
speak
to
you
of
him

I
only
want
you
to
understand

there
be
a
subject

must
be
secret
to
myself

on
which
I
may

allow
to
shed

so
weak

I
will
not

you
on

your

"
then
she
leave
him
,
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
depress
by
what
have
occur
,
 
but
not
think
of
it
as
of
a
trouble
which
would
do
more
than
make
him
uncomfortable
for
that
day
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
 
<EOS>
day
after
day
,
and
clause
after
clause
,
the
bill
be
fight
in
committee
,
and
few
man
fight
with
more
constancy
on
the
side
of
the
Ministers
than
do
the
member
for
Loughton
.
<EOS>
troubled
though
he
be
by
his
quarrel
with
Lord
Chiltern
,
by
his
love
for
Violet
Effingham
,
by
the
silence
of
his
friend
Lady
Laura
,
 
for
since
he
have
tell
her
of
the
duel
she
have
become
silent
to
him
,
never
write
to
him
,
and
hardly
speak
to
him
when
she
meet
him
in
society
,
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
Phineas
be
not
so
troubled
but
what
he
could
work
at
his
vocation
.
<EOS>
now
,
when
he
would
find
himself
upon
his
leg
in
the
House
,
he
would
wonder
at
the
hesitation
which
have
lately
trouble
him
so
sorely
.
<EOS>
He
would
sit
sometimes
and
speculate
upon
that
dimness
of
eye
,
upon
that
tendency
of
thing
to
go
round
,
upon
that
obtrusive
palpitation
of
heart
,
which
have
afflict
him
so
seriously
for
so
long
a
time
.
<EOS>
the
House
now
be
no
more
to
him
than
any
other
chamber
,
and
the
member
no
more
than
other
man
.
<EOS>
He
guard
himself
from
oration
,
speak
always
very
shortly
,
 
because
he
believe
that
policy
and
good
judgment
require
that
he
should
be
short
.
<EOS>
but
word
be
very
easy
to
him
,
and
he
would
feel
as
though
he
could
talk
for
ever
.
<EOS>
and
there
quickly
come
to
him
a
reputation
for
practical
usefulness
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
with
strong
opinion
,
who
could
yet
be
submissive
.
<EOS>
and
no
man
seem
to
know
how
his
reputation
have
come
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
one
good
speech
after
two
or
three
failure
.
<EOS>
all
who
know
him
,
his
whole
party
,
have
be
aware
of
his
failure
;
and
his
one
good
speech
have
be
regard
by
many
as
no
very
wonderful
effort
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
man
who
be
pleasant
to
other
man
,
 
not
combative
,
not
self
-
assert
beyond
the
point
at
which
self
-
assertion
cease
to
be
a
necessity
of
manliness
.
<EOS>
nature
have
be
very
good
to
him
,
make
him
comely
inside
and
out
,
 
and
with
this
comeliness
he
have
creep
into
popularity
.
  
<EOS>
the
secret
of
the
duel
be
,
I
think
,
at
this
time
,
know
to
a
great
many
man
and
woman
.
<EOS>
so
Phineas
perceive
;
but
it
be
not
,
he
think
,
know
either
to
Lord
Brentford
or
to
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
and
in
this
he
be
right
.
<EOS>
no
rumour
of
it
have
yet
reach
the
ear
of
either
of
these
person
;
 
and
rumour
,
though
she
fly
so
fast
and
so
far
,
be
often
slow
in
reach
those
ear
which
would
be
most
interested
in
her
tiding
.
<EOS>
some
dim
report
of
the
duel
reach
even
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
he
ask
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
who
tell
you
?
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bonteen
tell
me
that
it
be
certainly
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bonteen
always
know
more
than
anybody
else
about
everything
except
his
own
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
be
not
true
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
pause
,
 
and
then
she
lie
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
be
not
true
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
ask
either
of
them
,
but
to
me
it
seem
to
be
the
most
improbable
thing
in
life
.
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Kennedy
believe
that
there
have
be
no
duel
.
<EOS>
in
his
wife
's
word
he
put
absolute
faith
,
and
he
think
that
she
would
certainly
know
anything
that
her
brother
have
do
.
<EOS>
as
he
be
a
man
give
to
but
little
discourse
,
he
ask
no
further
question
about
the
duel
either
in
the
House
or
at
the
Clubs
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
,
Phineas
have
be
greatly
dismay
when
man
have
ask
him
question
tend
to
elicit
from
him
some
explanation
of
the
mystery
;
 
but
by
degree
<EOS>
he
become
used
to
it
,
and
as
the
tiding
which
have
get
abroad
do
not
seem
to
injure
him
,
and
as
the
questioning
be
not
push
very
closely
,
he
become
indifferent
.
<EOS>
there
come
out
another
article
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
in
which
Lord
C
 
n
and
Mr.
P
 
<EOS>
s
<EOS>
F
 
n
be
speak
of
as
glare
example
of
that
aristocratic
snobility
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
expressive
word
coin
,
evidently
with
great
delight
,
for
the
occasion
,
 
which
the
rotten
state
of
London
society
in
high
quarter
now
produce
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
young
lord
,
infamously
notorious
,
quarrel
with
one
of
his
boon
-
companion
,
whom
he
have
appoint
to
a
private
seat
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
fight
duel
,
break
the
law
,
scandalise
the
public
,
 
and
all
this
be
do
without
punishment
to
the
guilty
!
<EOS>
there
be
old
story
afloat
,
 
so
say
the
article
 
of
what
in
a
former
century
have
be
do
by
Lord
Mohuns
and
Mr.
Bests
;
but
now
,
in
186
 
,
&
c.
&
c.
&
c.
<EOS>
and
so
the
article
go
on
.
<EOS>
any
reader
may
fill
in
without
difficulty
the
conclude
indignation
and
virtuous
appeal
for
reform
in
social
moral
as
well
as
Parliament
.
<EOS>
but
Phineas
have
so
far
progress
that
he
have
almost
come
to
like
this
kind
of
thing
.
  
<EOS>
certainly
I
think
that
the
duel
do
him
no
harm
in
society
.
<EOS>
otherwise
he
would
hardly
have
be
ask
to
a
semi
-
political
dinner
at
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
's
,
even
though
he
may
have
be
invite
to
make
one
of
the
five
hundred
guest
who
be
crowd
into
her
saloon
and
staircase
after
the
dinner
be
over
.
<EOS>
to
have
be
one
of
the
five
hundred
be
nothing
;
but
to
be
one
of
the
sixteen
be
a
great
deal
,
 
be
indeed
so
much
that
Phineas
,
not
understand
as
yet
the
advantage
of
his
own
comeliness
,
be
at
a
loss
to
conceive
why
so
pleasant
an
honour
be
confer
upon
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
man
among
the
eight
man
at
the
dinner
-
party
not
in
Parliament
,
 
and
the
only
other
except
Phineas
not
attach
to
the
Government
<EOS>
be
Mr.
Palliser
's
great
friend
,
John
Grey
,
the
member
for
Silverbridge
.
<EOS>
there
be
four
Cabinet
Ministers
in
the
room
,
 
the
Duke
,
Lord
Cantrip
,
Mr.
Gresham
,
and
the
owner
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
Barrington
Erle
and
young
Lord
Fawn
,
an
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
but
the
wit
and
grace
of
the
lady
present
lend
more
of
character
to
the
party
than
even
the
position
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
herself
be
a
host
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
woman
then
in
London
better
able
to
talk
to
a
dozen
people
on
a
dozen
subject
;
and
then
,
moreover
,
she
be
still
in
the
flush
of
her
beauty
and
the
bloom
of
her
youth
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
be
there
;
 
by
what
mean
divide
from
her
husband
Phineas
could
not
imagine
;
but
Lady
Glencora
be
good
at
such
division
.
<EOS>
Lady
Cantrip
have
be
allow
to
come
with
her
lord
;
 
but
,
as
be
well
understand
,
Lord
Cantrip
be
not
so
manifestly
a
husband
as
be
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
who
can
not
guard
themselves
from
the
assertion
of
marital
right
at
most
inappropriate
moment
.
<EOS>
now
Lord
Cantrip
live
with
his
wife
most
happily
;
yet
you
should
pass
hour
with
him
and
her
together
,
and
hardly
know
that
they
know
each
other
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
Duke
's
daughter
be
there
,
 
but
not
the
Duchess
,
who
be
know
to
be
heavy
;
 
and
there
be
the
beauteous
Marchioness
of
Hartletop
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
be
in
the
room
also
,
 
give
Phineas
a
blow
at
the
heart
as
he
see
her
smile
.
<EOS>
may
it
be
that
he
could
speak
a
word
to
her
on
this
occasion
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
have
also
bring
his
wife
;
 
and
then
there
be
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Phineas
find
that
it
be
his
fortune
to
take
down
to
dinner
,
 
not
Violet
Effingham
,
but
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
and
,
when
he
be
place
at
dinner
,
on
the
other
side
of
him
there
sit
Lady
Hartletop
,
who
address
the
few
word
which
she
speak
exclusively
to
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
in
former
day
matter
difficult
of
arrangement
between
those
two
;
but
I
think
that
those
old
passage
have
now
be
forget
by
them
both
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
,
therefore
,
drive
to
depend
exclusively
on
Madame
Max
Goesler
for
conversation
,
and
he
find
that
he
be
not
call
upon
to
cast
his
seed
into
barren
ground
.
  
<EOS>
up
to
that
moment
he
have
never
hear
of
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
in
introduce
them
,
have
pronounce
the
lady
's
name
so
clearly
that
he
have
catch
it
with
accuracy
,
but
he
could
not
surmise
whence
<EOS>
she
have
come
,
or
why
she
be
there
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
probably
something
over
thirty
year
of
age
.
<EOS>
She
have
thick
black
hair
,
which
she
wear
in
curls
,
 
unlike
anybody
else
in
the
world
,
 
in
curl
which
hang
down
low
beneath
her
face
,
cover
,
and
perhaps
intend
to
cover
,
a
certain
thinness
in
her
cheek
which
would
otherwise
have
take
something
from
the
charm
of
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
large
,
of
a
dark
blue
colour
,
and
very
bright
,
 
and
she
use
them
in
a
manner
which
be
as
yet
hardly
common
with
Englishwomen
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
intend
that
you
should
know
that
she
employ
them
to
conquer
you
,
look
as
a
knight
may
have
look
in
olden
day
who
enter
a
chamber
with
his
sword
draw
from
the
scabbard
and
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
forehead
be
broad
and
somewhat
low
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
be
not
classically
beautiful
,
be
broad
at
the
nostril
than
beauty
require
,
and
,
moreover
,
not
perfectly
straight
in
its
line
.
<EOS>
Her
lip
be
thin
.
<EOS>
Her
tooth
,
which
she
endeavour
to
show
as
little
as
possible
,
be
perfect
in
form
and
colour
.
<EOS>
They
who
criticise
her
severely
say
,
however
,
that
they
be
too
large
.
<EOS>
Her
chin
be
well
form
,
and
divide
by
a
dimple
which
give
to
her
face
a
softness
of
grace
which
would
otherwise
have
be
much
miss
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
her
great
beauty
be
in
the
brilliant
clearness
of
her
dark
complexion
.
<EOS>
You
may
almost
fancy
that
you
could
see
into
it
so
as
to
read
the
different
line
beneath
the
skin
.
<EOS>
She
be
somewhat
tall
,
though
by
no
means
tall
to
a
fault
,
and
be
so
thin
as
to
be
almost
meagre
in
her
proportion
.
<EOS>
She
always
wear
her
dress
close
up
to
her
neck
,
and
never
show
the
bareness
of
her
arm
.
<EOS>
though
she
be
the
only
woman
so
clothe
now
present
in
the
room
,
this
singularity
do
not
specially
strike
one
,
because
in
other
respect
her
apparel
be
so
rich
and
quaint
as
to
make
inattention
to
it
impossible
.
<EOS>
the
observer
who
do
not
observe
very
closely
would
perceive
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
dress
be
unlike
the
dress
of
other
woman
,
but
see
that
it
be
unlike
in
make
,
unlike
in
colour
,
and
<EOS>
unlike
in
material
,
the
ordinary
observer
would
not
see
also
that
it
be
unlike
in
form
for
any
other
purpose
than
that
of
maintain
its
general
peculiarity
of
character
.
<EOS>
in
colour
she
be
abundant
,
and
yet
the
fabric
of
her
garment
be
always
black
.
<EOS>
My
pen
may
not
dare
to
describe
the
tracery
of
yellow
and
ruby
silk
which
go
in
and
out
through
the
black
lace
,
across
her
bosom
,
and
round
her
neck
,
and
over
her
shoulder
,
and
along
her
arm
,
and
down
to
the
very
ground
at
her
foot
,
rob
the
black
stuff
of
all
its
sombre
solemnity
,
and
produce
a
brightness
in
which
there
be
nothing
gaudy
.
<EOS>
She
wear
no
vestige
of
crinoline
,
and
hardly
anything
that
could
be
call
a
train
.
<EOS>
and
the
lace
sleeve
of
her
dress
,
with
their
bright
tracery
of
silk
,
be
fit
close
to
her
arm
;
and
round
her
neck
<EOS>
she
wear
the
small
possible
collar
of
lace
,
above
which
there
be
a
short
chain
of
roman
gold
with
a
ruby
pendant
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
ruby
in
her
ear
,
and
a
ruby
brooch
,
and
ruby
in
the
bracelet
on
her
arm
.
<EOS>
such
,
as
regard
the
outward
woman
,
be
Madame
Max
Goesler
;
and
Phineas
,
as
he
take
his
place
by
her
side
,
think
that
fortune
for
the
nonce
have
do
well
with
him
,
 
only
that
he
should
have
like
it
so
much
well
<EOS>
could
he
have
be
seat
next
to
Violet
Effingham
!
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
in
the
matter
of
conversation
his
morsel
of
seed
be
not
throw
into
barren
ground
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
he
can
truly
be
say
to
have
produce
even
a
morsel
.
<EOS>
the
subject
be
all
moot
by
the
lady
,
and
so
great
be
her
fertility
in
discourse
that
all
conversational
grass
seem
to
grow
with
her
spontaneously
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
say
,
"
what
would
I
not
give
to
be
a
member
of
the
British
Parliament
at
such
a
moment
as
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
at
such
a
moment
as
this
particularly
?
"
  
"
because
there
be
something
to
be
do
,
which
,
let
me
tell
you
,
senator
though
you
be
,
be
not
always
the
case
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
experience
be
short
,
but
it
sometimes
seem
to
me
that
there
be
too
much
to
be
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
too
much
of
nothingness
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
be
not
that
the
case
?
<EOS>
but
now
there
be
a
real
fight
in
the
list
.
<EOS>
the
one
great
drawback
to
the
life
of
woman
be
that
they
can
not
act
in
politic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
which
side
would
you
take
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
here
in
England
?
"
say
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
 
from
which
expression
,
and
from
one
or
two
other
of
a
similar
nature
,
Phineas
be
lead
into
a
doubt
whether
the
lady
be
a
countrywoman
of
his
or
not
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
hard
to
say
.
<EOS>
politically
I
should
want
to
out
-
Turnbull
Mr.
Turnbull
,
to
vote
for
everything
that
could
be
vote
for
,
 
ballot
,
manhood
suffrage
,
womanhood
suffrage
,
unlimited
right
of
striking
,
tenant
right
,
education
of
everybody
,
annual
parliament
,
and
the
abolition
of
at
least
the
bench
of
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
strong
programme
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
strong
,
Mr.
Finn
,
but
that
be
what
I
should
like
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
however
,
that
I
should
be
tempt
to
feel
a
dastard
security
in
the
conviction
that
I
may
advocate
my
view
without
any
danger
of
see
them
carry
out
.
<EOS>
for
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
do
not
at
all
want
to
put
down
lady
and
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
that
they
would
go
with
the
bench
of
bishop
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
anything
to
go
,
 
that
is
,
as
far
as
real
life
be
concern
.
<EOS>
there
be
that
dear
good
Bishop
of
Abingdon
be
the
good
friend
I
have
in
the
world
,
 
and
as
for
the
Bishop
of
Dorchester
,
I
would
walk
from
here
to
there
to
hear
him
preach
.
<EOS>
and
I
would
sooner
hem
apron
for
them
all
myself
than
that
they
should
want
those
pretty
decoration
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
Mr.
Finn
,
there
be
such
a
difference
between
life
and
theory
;
 
be
there
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
it
be
so
comfortable
to
have
theory
that
one
be
not
bind
to
carry
out
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
do
you
live
up
to
your
political
theory
?
<EOS>
"
at
this
moment
Mr.
Palliser
be
sit
perfectly
silent
between
Lady
Hartletop
and
the
Duke
's
daughter
,
and
he
give
a
little
spring
in
his
chair
as
this
sudden
address
be
make
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Your
House
of
Commons
theory
,
I
mean
,
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
be
say
that
it
be
very
well
to
have
far
advanced
idea
,
 
it
do
not
matter
how
far
advanced
,
 
because
one
be
never
call
upon
to
act
upon
them
practically
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
dangerous
doctrine
,
I
think
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
pleasant
,
 
so
at
least
Mr.
Finn
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
be
at
least
very
common
,
"
say
Phineas
,
not
care
to
protect
himself
by
a
contradiction
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
myself
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
gravely
,
"
I
think
I
may
say
that
I
always
be
really
anxious
to
carry
into
practice
all
those
doctrine
of
policy
which
I
advocate
in
theory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
during
this
conversation
Lady
Hartletop
sit
as
though
no
word
of
it
reach
her
ear
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
understand
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
and
by
no
means
love
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
when
he
have
make
his
little
speech
,
turn
to
the
Duke
's
daughter
and
ask
some
question
about
the
conservatory
at
Longroyston
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
call
forth
a
word
of
wisdom
,
"
say
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"

Phineas
,
"
and
teach
a
Cabinet
Minister
to
believe
that
I
be
a
most
unsound
politician
.
<EOS>
You
may
have
ruin
my
prospect
for
life
,
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
hope
not
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
can
understand
the
way
of
thing
in
your
government
,
the
aspirant
to
office
succeed
chiefly
by
make
themselves
uncommonly
unpleasant
to
those
who
be
in
power
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
can
hit
hard
enough
he
be
sure
to
be
take
into
the
elysium
of
the
Treasury
bench
,
 
not
that
he
may
hit
other
,
but
that
he
may
cease
to
hit
those
who
be
there

<EOS>
I
do
not
think
man

choose
because
they
be
useful

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
severe
upon
us
all

"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
one
man
be
as
useful
as
another
.
<EOS>
but
to
put
aside
joking
,
 
they
tell
me
that
you
be
sure
to
become
a
minister
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
feel
that
he
blush
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
people
say
of
him
behind
his
back
that
he
be
a
man
likely
to
rise
high
in
political
position
?
<EOS>
"
Your
informant
be
very
kind
,
"
he
reply
awkwardly
,
"
but
I
do
not
know
who
they
be
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
get
up
in
the
way
you
describe
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
by
abuse
the
man
I
support

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
turn
round
to
Mr.
Grey
,
who
be
sit
on
the
other
side
of
her
,
and
Phineas
be
leave
for
a
moment
in
silence
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
say
a
word
to
Lady
Hartletop
,
but
Lady
Hartletop
only
bow
her
head
gracefully
in
recognition
of
the
truth
of
the
statement
he
make
.
<EOS>
so
he
apply
himself
for
a
while
to
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
Miss
Effingham
?
"
say
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
again
address
him
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
think
about
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
her
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
I
know
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
closely
connected
with
the
Kennedys
,
who
be
friend
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
have
hear
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
that
score
of
man
be
rave
about
her
.
<EOS>
be
you
one
of
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
;
 
I
do
not
mind
be
one
of
sundry
score
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
particular
in
own
to
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
admire
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
do
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
I
see
you
be
joke
.
<EOS>
I
do
amazingly
.
<EOS>
They
say
woman
never
do
admire
woman
,
but
I
most
sincerely
do
admire
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
she
a
friend
of
yours
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
;
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
dare
to
say
so
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
I
be
with
her
last
winter
for
a
week
at
Matching
,
and
of
course
I
meet
her
about
at
people
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
me
to
be
the
most
independent
girl
I
ever
know
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
do
believe
that
nothing
would
make
her
marry
a
man
unless
she
love
him
and
honour
him
,
and
I
think
it
be
so
very
seldom
that
you
can
say
that
of
a
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
also
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
then
he
pause
a
moment
before
he
continue
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
that
I
know
Miss
Effingham
very
intimately
,
but
from
what
I
have
see
of
her
,
I
should
think
it
very
probable
that
she
may
not
marry
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
probably
,
"
say
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
who
then
again
turn
away
to
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
ten
minute
after
this
,
when
the
moment
be
just
at
hand
in
which
the
lady
be
to
retreat
,
Madame
Max
Goesler
again
address
Phineas
,
look
very
full
into
his
face
as
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
the
time
will
ever
come
,
Mr.
Finn
,
in
which
you
will
give
me
an
account
of
that
day
's
journey
to
Blankenberg
?
"
  
"
to
Blankenberg
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
to
Blankenberg
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
ask
for
it
now
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
look
for
it
some
day
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lady
Glencora
rise
from
her
seat
,
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
go
out
with
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
 
<EOS>
what
have
Madame
Max
Goesler
to
do
with
his
journey
to
Blankenberg
?
<EOS>
think
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
sit
for
a
while
in
silence
between
Mr.
Palliser
and
Mr.
Grey
;
and
why
should
she
,
who
be
a
perfect
stranger
to
him
,
have
dare
to
ask
him
such
a
question
?
<EOS>
but
as
the
conversation
round
the
table
,
after
the
lady
have
go
,
soon
drift
into
politic
and
become
general
,
Phineas
,
for
a
while
,
forget
Madame
Max
Goesler
and
the
Blankenberg
journey
,
and
listen
to
the
eager
word
of
Cabinet
Ministers
,
now
and
again
utter
a
word
of
his
own
,
and
show
that
he
,
too
,
be
as
eager
as
other
.
<EOS>
but
the
session
in
Mr.
Palliser
's
dining
-
room
be
not
long
,
and
Phineas
soon
find
himself
make
his
way
amidst
a
throng
of
come
guest
into
the
room
above
.
<EOS>
His
object
be
to
meet
Violet
Effingham
,
but
,
fail
that
,
he
would
not
be
unwilling
to
say
a
few
more
word
to
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
He
first
encounter
Lady
Laura
,
to
whom
he
have
not
speak
as
yet
,
and
,
find
himself
stand
close
to
her
for
a
while
,
he
ask
her
after
his
late
neighbour
.
"
<EOS>
do
tell
me
one
thing
,
Lady
Laura
;
 
who
be
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
and
why
have
I
never
meet
her
before
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
will
be
two
thing
,
Mr.
Finn
;
but
I
will
answer
both
question
as
well
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
meet
her
before
,
because
she
be
in
Germany
last
spring
and
summer
,
and
in
the
year
before
that
you
be
not
about
so
much
as
you
have
be
since
.
<EOS>
still
you
must
have
see
her
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
widow
of
an
austrian
banker
,
and
have
live
the
great
part
of
her
life
at
Vienna
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
rich
,
and
have
a
small
house
in
Park
Lane
,
where
she
receive
people
so
exclusively
that
it
have
come
to
be
think
an
honour
to
be
invite
by
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Her
enemy
say
that
her
father
be
a
german
Jew
,
live
in
England
,
in
the
employment
of
the
viennese
banker
,
and
they
say
also
that
she
have
be
marry
a
second
time
to
an
Austrian
Count
,
to
whom
she
allow
ever
so
much
a
year
to
stay
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
but
of
all
this
,
nobody
,
I
fancy
,
know
anything
.
<EOS>
what
they
do
know
be
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
spend
seven
or
eight
thousand
a
year
,
and
that
she
will
give
no
man
an
opportunity
of
even
ask
her
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
People
use
to
be
shy
of
her
,
but
she
go
almost
everywhere
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
not
be
at
Portman
Square
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
no
<EOS>
;
but
then
Lady
Glencora
be
so
much
more
advanced
than
we
be
!
<EOS>
after
all
,
we
be
but
humdrum
people
,
as
the
world
go
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
Phineas
begin
to
roam
about
the
room
,
strive
to
find
an
opportunity
of
engross
five
minute
of
Miss
Effingham
's
attention
.
<EOS>
during
the
time
that
Lady
Laura
be
give
him
the
history
of
Madame
Max
Goesler
<EOS>
his
eye
have
wander
round
,
and
he
have
perceive
that
Violet
be
stand
in
the
further
corner
of
a
large
lobby
on
to
which
the
stair
open
,
 
so
situated
,
indeed
,
that
she
could
hardly
escape
,
because
of
the
increase
crowd
,
but
on
that
very
account
almost
impossible
to
be
reach
.
<EOS>
He
could
see
,
also
,
that
she
be
talk
to
Lord
Fawn
,
an
unmarried
peer
of
something
over
thirty
year
of
age
,
with
an
unrivalled
pair
of
whisker
,
a
small
estate
,
and
a
rise
political
reputation
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
be
talk
to
Violet
through
the
whole
dinner
,
and
Phineas
be
begin
to
think
that
he
should
like
to
make
another
journey
to
Blankenberg
,
with
the
object
of
meet
his
lordship
on
the
sand
.
<EOS>
when
Lady
Laura
have
do
speak
,
his
eye
be
turn
through
a
large
open
doorway
towards
the
spot
on
which
his
idol
be
stand
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
of
no
use
,
my
friend
,
"
she
say
,
touch
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
make
you
know
that
it
be
of
no
use
,
because
then
I
think
you
would
be
happy
.
<EOS>
"
to
this
Phineas
make
no
answer
,
but
go
and
roam
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
why
should
it
be
of
no
use
?
<EOS>
Would
violet
Effingham
marry
any
man
merely
because
he
be
a
lord
?
  
<EOS>
some
half
-
hour
after
this
he
have
succeed
in
make
his
way
up
to
the
place
in
which
Violet
be
still
stand
,
with
Lord
Fawn
beside
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
make
such
a
struggle
to
get
to
you
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
you
be
here
,
you
will
have
to
stay
,
for
it
be
impossible
to
get
out
,
"
she
answer
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
make
the
attempt
half
-
a
-
dozen
time
,
but
have
fail
grievously
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
quite
contented
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
;
 
"
more
than
contented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
feel
that
he
ought
to
give
some
special
reason
to
Miss
Effingham
to
account
for
his
effort
to
reach
her
,
but
yet
he
have
nothing
special
to
say
.
<EOS>
have
Lord
Fawn
not
be
there
,
he
would
immediately
have
tell
her
that
he
be
wait
for
an
answer
to
the
question
he
have
ask
her
in
Saulsby
Park
,
but
he
could
hardly
do
this
in
presence
of
the
noble
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
She
receive
him
with
her
pleasant
genial
smile
,
look
exactly
as
she
have
look
when
he
have
part
from
her
on
the
morning
after
their
ride
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
show
any
sign
of
anger
,
or
even
of
indifference
at
his
approach
.
<EOS>
but
still
it
be
almost
necessary
that
he
should
account
for
his
search
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
so
long
to
hear
from
you
how
you
get
on
at
Loughlinter
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
 
yes
;
and
I
will
tell
you
something
of
it
some
day
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
not
come
to
Lady
Baldock
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
even
know
that
Lady
Baldock
be
in
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
have
know
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
be
in
town
.
<EOS>
where
do
you
suppose
I
be
live
?
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
be
there
yesterday
,
and
can
tell
you
that
my
aunt
be
quite
bloom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Baldock
be
bloom
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
;
"
certainly
bloom
;
 
that
is
,
if
evergreen
may
be
say
to
bloom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
evergreen
do
bloom
,
as
well
as
spring
plant
,
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
You
come
and
see
her
,
Mr.
Finn
;
 
only
you
must
bring
a
little
money
with
you
for
the
female
Protestant
Unmarried
Women
's
Emigration
Society
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
aunt
's
present
hobby
,
as
Lord
Fawn
know
to
his
cost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
may
never
spend
half
-
a
-
sovereign
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
a
perilous
affair
for
me
,
as
my
aunt
want
me
to
go
out
as
a
sort
of
lead
<EOS>
Protestant
unmarried
female
emigrant
pioneer
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
that
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
with
much
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
will
go
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
,
if
I
be
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
doubt
,
"
say
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
such
a
grand
prospect
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
an
opening
in
life
.
<EOS>
so
much
excitement
,
you
know
;
and
such
a
useful
career
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
if
there
be
not
plenty
of
opening
here
for
Miss
Effingham
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
"
and
plenty
of
excitement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
there
be
?
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
much
more
civil
than
Mr.
Finn
,
I
must
say
.
<EOS>
"
then
Phineas
begin
to
hope
that
he
nee
not
be
afraid
of
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
happy
man
you
be
at
dinner
!
"
continue
Violet
,
address
herself
to
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Lord
Fawn
be
the
happy
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
Madame
Max
Goesler
all
to
yourself
for
nearly
two
hour
,
and
I
suppose
there
be
not
a
creature
in
the
room
who
do
not
envy
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
that
ever
so
much
interest
be
make
with
Lady
Glencora
as
to
take
Madame

down
to
dinner

Lord

,
I
know
,
intrigue

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Effingham
,
really
I
must
 
contradict
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
Barrington
Erle
beg
for
it
as
a
particular
favour
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
,
with
a
sigh
,
own
that
it
be
impossible
,
because
of
his
cumbrous
rank
;
and
Mr.
Gresham
,
when
it
be
offer
to
him
,
declare
that
he
be
fatigue
with
the
business
of
the
House

not
up

I

She

I
take
it

it
be
good
for
nothing
at
all
when
it

find
out

therefore
it
be
that

"
You
do
not

now
that

He
have
not

be
retire
from

discomfit

not
dispirit

Lord

he

be
not

Lady

then
Lady

Violet

certainly
know
what

know
them

smile
on

be
gracious

Would
she
do
so

his
pretension

can
make

Lady

it

dull

do
not

all

<EOS>
Miss
Boreham
could
never
master
her
mother
by
her
own
effort

but
it
be
,
I
think
,
by
a
little
intrigue
on
her
part
that
Lady
Baldock
be
master
,
and
,
indeed
,
altogether
cow
,
in
reference

that
this
victory
be
gain
on
that
very
afternoon

prevent

You

Baldock
at
any
rate
put
so
much
faith
in
her
son
's
story
as
to
make
her
feel
it
to
be
her
duty
to
interrogate
her
niece
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
at
this
period
of
her
life
be
certainly
not
free
from
fear
of
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
in
the
numerous
encounter
which
take
place
between
them
,
the
aunt
seldom
gain
that
amount
of
victory
which
would
have
completely
satisfy
her
spirit
.
<EOS>
She
long
to
be
dominant
over
her
niece
as
she
be
dominant
over
her
daughter
;
and
when
she
find
that
she
miss
such
supremacy
,
she
long
to
tell
Violet
to
depart
from
out
her
border
,
and
be
no
longer
niece
of
hers
.
<EOS>
but
have
she
ever
do
so
<EOS>
,
Violet
would
have
go
at
the
instant
,
and
then
terrible
thing
would
have
follow
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
satisfaction
in
turn
out
of
door
a
nephew
or
niece
who
be
pecuniarily
dependent
,
but
when
the
youthful
relative
be
richly
endow
,
the
satisfaction
be
much
diminish
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
duty
of
a
guardian
,
no
doubt
,
to
look
after
the
ward
;
but
if
this
can
not
be
do
,
the
ward
's
money
should
at
least
be
hold
with
as
close
a
fist
as
possible
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Baldock
,
though
she
know
that
she
would
be
sorely
wound
,
poke
about
on
her
old
body
with
the
sharp
lance
of
disobedience
,
and
strike
with
the
cruel
sword
of
satire
,
if
she
take
upon
herself
to
scold
or
even
to
question
violet
,
nevertheless
would
not
abandon
the
pleasure
of
lecturing
and
teaching
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
duty
,
"
she
would
say
to
herself
,
"
and
though
it
be
take
in
a
bad
spirit
,
I
will
always
perform
my
duty
.
"
<EOS>
so
she
perform
her
duty
,
and
ask
Violet
Effingham
some
few
question
respect
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
<EOS>
,
"
she
say
,
"
do
you
remember
meet
a
Mr.
Finn
at
Saulsby
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
Mr.
Finn
,
aunt
!
<EOS>
why
,
he
be
a
particular
friend
of
mine

<EOS>
of
course
I
do
,
and
he
be
at
Saulsby

<EOS>
I
have
meet
him
there
more
than
once
.
<EOS>

not
you
remember
that
we

ride
about

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
that
he
be
there

certainly
;

I
do
not
know
that
he
be
a
special
 
friend

Most
especial

,
I
may
say
;
 
among
young
man
,
I
mean

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
be
certainly
the
most
indiscreet
of
old
woman
in
such
a
matter
as
this
,
and
violet
the
most
provoking
of
young
lady
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
,
believe
that
there
be
something
to
fear
,
 
as
,
indeed
,
there
be
,
much
to
fear
,
 
should
have
be
content
to
destroy
the
card
,
and
to
keep
the
young
lady
away
from
the
young
gentleman
,
if
such
keeping
away
be
possible
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Effingham
be
certainly
very
wrong
to
speak
of
any
young
man
as
be
a
1
.
<EOS>
fond
as
I
be
of
Miss
Effingham
,
I
can
not
justify
her
,
and
must
acknowledge
that
she
use
the
most
offensive
phrase
she
could
find
,
on
purpose
to
annoy
her
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
"

Lady
Baldock

up

I
never

such
a

<EOS>

not
as

<EOS>
I
think
it
simply

a

do
you
mean

<EOS>

yes

then
he

It

he
nearly
kill
one

take

he

here
be
his
golden
hope

realise

hope
as
to
the
realisation
of

he
have
be
quite
despondent
twelve
month

yet
he
be
uncomfortable

he
be
to

<EOS>
have
the

inferior

not

mind
it

would
have
be
full
of
joy
at

promotion
propose

Laurence
Fitzgibbon
be
such
a
poor
creature

that
the
idea
of
fill
a

distasteful

<EOS>
His
triumph
would
have
be
so
complete
<EOS>
have
Mr.
Mildmay
allow
him
to
go
into
the
high
place
at
one
leap
.
<EOS>
other
man
who
have
make
themselves
useful
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
hour
after
receive
Lord
Brentford
's
letter
,
the
idea
of
become
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
be
almost
displeasing
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
an
idea
that
junior
lordship
of
the
Treasury
be
generally
bestow
on
young
member
whom
it
be
convenient
to
secure
,
but
who
be
not
good
at
do
anything
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
moment
in
which
he
think
that
he
would
refuse
to
be
make
a
junior
lord
.
  
<EOS>
but
during
the
night
cool
reflection
tell
him
that
he
have
be
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
up
politic
with
the
express
desire
of
get
his
foot
upon
a
rung
of
the
ladder
of
promotion
,
and
now
,
in
his
third
session
,
he
be
about
to
be
successful
.
<EOS>
even
as
a
junior
lord
he
would
have
a
thousand
a
year
;
and
how
long
may
he
have
sit
in
chamber
,
and
have
wander
about
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
and
have
loiter
in
the
court
strive
to
look
as
though
he
have
business
,
before
he
would
have
earn
a
thousand
a
year
!
<EOS>
even
as
a
junior
lord
he
could
make
himself
useful
,
and
when
once
he
should
be
know
to
be
a
good
working
man
,
promotion
would
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
no
ladder
can
be
mount
without
labour
;
but
this
ladder
be
now
open
above
his
head
,
and
he
already
have
his
foot
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
half
-
past
eleven
he
be
with
Lord
Brentford
,
who
receive
him
with
the
bland
smile
and
a
pressure
of
the
hand
which
be
quite
cordial
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Finn
,
"
he
say
,
"
this
give
me
the
most
sincere
pleasure
,
 
the
great
pleasure
in
the
world

<EOS>
Our
connection
together
at
Loughton
of
course
make
it
doubly
agreeable
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
be
too
grateful
to
you
,
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
;
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
your
own
doing
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Mildmay
ask
me
whether
I
do
not
think
you
the
most
promising
of
the
young
member
on
our
side
in
your
House
,
I
certainly
do
say
that
I
quite
concur
.
<EOS>
but
I
should
be
take
too
much
on
myself
<EOS>
,
I
should
be
act
dishonestly
,
if
I
be
to
allow
you
to
imagine
that
it
be
my
proposition
.
<EOS>
have
he
ask
me
to
recommend
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
name
you
;
that
I
say
frankly
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
name
you
himself
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
your
friend
Finn
would
join
us
at
the
Treasury
?
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
that
I
do
think
so
.
"
<EOS>
and
do
you
not
think
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
it
would
be
a
useful
appointment
?
<EOS>
"
then
I
venture
to
say
that
I
have
no
doubt
whatever
on
that
point
;
 
that
I
know
you
well
enough
to
feel
confident
that
you
would
lend
a
strength
to
the
Liberal
Government
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
few
word
say
about
your
seat
,
and
I
be
commission
to
write
to
you
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
be
grateful
,
but
not
too
grateful
,
and
bear
himself
very
well
in
the
interview
.
<EOS>
He
explain
to
Lord
Brentford
that
of
course
it
be
his
object
to
serve
the
country
,
 
and
to
be
pay
for
his
service
,
 
and
that
he
consider
himself
to
be
very
fortunate
to
be
select
so
early
in
his
career
for
parliamentary
place
.
<EOS>
He
would
endeavour
to
do
his
duty
,
and
could
safely
say
of
himself
that
he
do
not
wish
to
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
.
<EOS>
as
he
make
this
assertion
,
he
think
of
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
have
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
,
and
yet
he
be
promote
.
<EOS>
but
Phineas
say
nothing
to
Lord
Brentford
about
his
idle
friend
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
make
his
little
speech
he
ask
a
question
about
the
borough
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
venture
to
write
a
letter
to
my
agent
at
Loughton
,
tell
him
that
you
have
accept
office
,
and
that
you
will
be
shortly
there
again
.
<EOS>
He
will
see
Shortribs
and
arrange
it
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
be
you
I
should
write
to
Shortribs
and
to
Grating
,
 
after
I
have
see
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
will
not
mention
my
name
,
"
<EOS>
and
the
Earl
look
very
grave
as
he
utter
this
caution
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
will
not
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
will
find
any
difficulty
about
the
seat
,
"
say
the
peer
.
<EOS>
"
there
never
have
be
any
difficulty
at
Loughton
yet
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
that
for
them
.
<EOS>
and
if
we
can
scrape
through
with
Clause
72
we
shall
be
all
right
;
 
shall
we
not
?
"
<EOS>
this
be
the
clause
as
to
which
so
violent
an
opposition
be
expect
from
Mr.
Turnbull
,
 
a
clause
as
to
which
Phineas
himself
have
feel
that
he
would
hardly
know
how
to
support
the
Government
,
in
the
event
of
the
committee
be
press
to
a
division
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Could
he
,
an
ardent
reformer
,
a
reformer
at
heart
,
 
could
he
say
that
such
a
borough
as
Loughton
should
be
spare
;
 
that
the
arrangement
by
which
Shortribs
and
Grating
have
send
him
to
Parliament
,
in
obedience
to
Lord
Brentford
's
order
,
be
in
due
accord
with
the
theory
of
a
representative
legislature
?
<EOS>
in
what
respect
have
Gatton
and
Old
Sarum
be
bad
than
Loughton
?
<EOS>
be
he
not
himself
false
to
his
principle
in
sit
for
such
a
borough
as
Loughton
?
<EOS>
He
have
speak
to
Mr.
Monk
,
and
Mr.
Monk
have
tell
him
that
Rome
be
not
build
in
a
day
,
 
and
have
tell
him
also
that
good
thing
be
most
value
and
be
more
valuable
when
they
come
by
instalment
.
<EOS>
but
then
Mr.
Monk
himself
enjoy
the
satisfaction
of
sit
for
a
popular
constituency
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
personally
prick
in
the
conscience
by
his
own
parliamentary
position
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
  
now
that
Phineas
have
consent
to
join
the
Government
,
any
such
consideration
as
these
must
be
lay
aside
.
<EOS>
He
could
no
longer
be
a
free
agent
,
or
even
a
free
thinker
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
quite
aware
of
this
,
and
have
teach
himself
to
understand
that
member
of
Parliament
in
the
direct
service
of
the
Government
be
absolve
from
the
necessity
of
free
-
thinking
.
<EOS>
individual
free
-
thinking
be
incompatible
with
the
position
of
a
member
of
the
Government
,
and
unless
such
abnegation
be
practise
,
no
government
would
be
possible
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
course
a
man
's
duty
to
bind
himself
together
with
no
other
man
but
those
with
whom
,
on
matter
of
general
policy
,
he
could
agree
heartily
;
 
but
have
find
that
he
could
so
agree
,
he
know
that
it
would
be
his
duty
as
a
subaltern
to
vote
as
he
be
direct
.
<EOS>
It
would
trouble
his
conscience
less
to
sit
for
Loughton
and
vote
for
an
objectionable
clause
as
a
member
of
the
Government
,
than
it
would
have
do
to
give
such
a
vote
as
an
independent
member
.
<EOS>
in
so
resolve
,
he
think
that
he
be
simply
act
in
accordance
with
the
acknowledge
rule
of
parliamentary
government
.
<EOS>
and
therefore
,
when
Lord
Brentford
speak
of
Clause
72
,
he
could
answer
pleasantly
,
"
I
think
we
shall
carry
it
;
and
,
you
see
,
in
get
it
through
committee
,
if
we
can
carry
it
by
one
,
that
be
as
good
as
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
comfort
of
close
-
fighting
in
committee
.
<EOS>
in
the
open
House
we
be
almost
as
much
beat
by
a
narrow
majority
as
by
a
vote
against
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
so
;
just
so
,
"
say
Lord
Brentford
,
delight
to
see
that
his
young
pupil
,
 
as
he
regard
him
,
 
understand
so
well
the
system
of
parliamentary
management
.
<EOS>
"
by
-
the
-
bye
,
Finn
,
have
you
see
Chiltern
lately
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
quite
lately
,
"
say
Phineas
,
blush
up
to
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
or
hear
from
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
nor
hear
from
him
.
<EOS>
when
last
I
hear
of
him
he
be
in
Brussels
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
 
yes
;
he
be
somewhere
on
the
Rhine
now
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
as
you
be
so
intimate
,
perhaps
you
correspond
with
him
.
<EOS>
have
you
hear
that
we
have
arrange
about
Lady
Laura
's
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
would
return
,
"
say
Lord
Brentford
sadly
,
 
almost
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
that
great
difficulty
be
over
,
I
would
receive
him
willingly
,
and
make
my
house
pleasant
to
him
,
if
I
can
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
be
most
anxious
that
he
should
settle
,
and
marry
.
<EOS>
Could
you
not
write
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
phineas
,
not
daring
to
tell
Lord
Brentford
that
he
have
quarrel
with
Lord
Chiltern
,
 
feel
that
if
he
do
so
everything
would
go
wrong
,
 
say
that
he
would
write
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
go
away
he
feel
that
he
be
bind
to
get
an
answer
from
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
if
it
should
be
necessary
,
he
be
willing
to
break
with
Lord
Brentford
on
that
matter
,
 
even
though
such
breaking
should
lose
him
his
borough
and
his
place
;
 
but
not
on
any
other
matter
.
   
<EOS>
Phineas
and
His
Friends
 
<EOS>
Our
hero
's
friend
be
,
I
think
,
almost
more
elated
by
our
hero
's
promotion
than
be
our
hero
himself
.
<EOS>
He
never
tell
himself
that
it
be
a
great
thing
to
be
a
junior
lord
of
the
Treasury
,
though
he
acknowledge
to
himself
that
to
have
make
a
successful
beginning
be
a
very
great
thing
.
<EOS>
but
his
friend
be
loud
in
their
congratulation
,
 
or
condolement
as
the
case
may
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
his
interview
with
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
,
after
that
,
one
of
his
first
step
be
to
inform
Mrs.
Bunce
that
he
must
change
his
lodging
.
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
Mrs.
Bunce
,
not
that
I
want
anything
well
;
but
that
a
well
position
will
be
advantageous
to
me
,
and
that
I
can
afford
to
pay
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunce
acknowledge
the
truth
of
the
argument
,
with
her
apron
up
to
her
eye
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
to
be
so
fond
of
look
after
you
,
Mr.
Finn
!
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
just
what
you
pay
like
,
because
another
party
will
pay
as
much
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
get
so
used
to
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
 
have
not
we
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunce
be
probably
not
aware
herself
that
the
comeliness
of
her
lodger
have
please
her
feminine
eye
,
and
touch
her
feminine
heart
.
<EOS>
have
anybody
say
that
Mrs.
Bunce
be
in
love
with
Phineas
,
the
scandal
would
have
be
monstrous
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
so
,
 
after
a
fashion
.
<EOS>
and
Bunce
know
it
,
 
after
his
fashion
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
such
an
old
fool
,
"
he
say
,
"
cry
after
him
because
he
be
six
foot
high
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
cry
after
him
because
he
be
six
foot
high
,
"
whine
the
poor
woman
;
 
"
but
one
do
like
old
face
well
than
new
,

a
gentleman
about
one
's
place
be
pleasant
.
"
<EOS>
"
Gentleman
be
d
 
d
,
"
say
Bunce
.
<EOS>
but
his
anger
be
excited
,
not
by
his
wife
's
love
for
Phineas
,
but
by
the
use
of
an
objectionable
word
.
  
<EOS>
bunce
himself
have
be
on
very
friendly
term
with
Phineas
,
and
they
two
have
have
many
discussion
on
matter
of
politic
,
Bunce
take
up
the
cudgel
always
for
Mr.
Turnbull
,
and
generally
slip
away
gradually
into
some
account
of
his
own
martyrdom
.
<EOS>
for
he
have
be
a
martyr
,
have
fail
in
obtain
any
redress
against
the
policeman
who
have
imprison
him
so
wrongfully
.
<EOS>
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
have
fight
for
him
manfully
,
and
therefore
there
be
a
little
disagreement
between
him
and
Phineas
on
the
subject
of
that
great
organ
of
public
opinion
.
<EOS>
and
as
Mr.
Bunce
think
that
his
lodger
be
very
wrong
to
sit
for
Lord
Brentford
's
borough
,
subject
be
sometimes
touch
which
be
a
little
gall
to
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
touch
this
promotion
,
Bunce
have
nothing
but
condolement
to
offer
to
the
new
junior
lord
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
"
say
he
,
in
answer
to
an
argument
from
Phineas
,
"
I
suppose
there
must
be
lord
,
as
you
call
'em
;
though
for
the
matter
of
that
I
can
not
see
as
they
be
of
any
mortal
use

Would
not

I

there
must

Mr.
Bunce
,
I
shall
not
save
my
place
at
the
expense
of
my
conscience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
if
you
know
it
,
you
mean
.
<EOS>
but
the
bad
of
it
be
that
a
man
get
so
thick
into
the
mud
that
he
do
not
know
whether
he
be
dirty
or
clean
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
wote
as
you
be
tell
,
and
of
course
you
will
think
it
be
right
enough
.
<EOS>
be
not
you
be
among
Parliament
gent
long
enough
to
know
that
that
be
the
way
it
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
no
honest
man
can
be
a
member
of
the
Government
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
that
,
but
I
think
honesty
be
a
deal
easy
away
from
'em
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
Mr.
Finn
,
it
be
all
wrong
with
us
yet
,
and
will
be
till
we
get
it
nigher
to
the
great
american
model
.
<EOS>
if
a
poor
man
get
into
Parliament
,
 
<EOS>
you
will
excuse
me
,
Mr.
Finn
,
but
I
call
you
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
 
as
a
member
of
Parliament
I
be
a
very
poor
man
.
"
  
"
just
so
,
 
and
therefore
what
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
You
go
and
lay
yourself
out
for
government
!
<EOS>
I
be
not
say
as
how
you
be
anyways
wrong
.
<EOS>
a
man
have
to
live
.
<EOS>
You
have
win
way
,
and
a
good
physiognomy
of
your
own
,
and
be
as
big
as
a
life
-
guardsman
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
as
he
hear
this
doubtful
praise
laugh
and
blush
.
<EOS>
"
very
well
;
you
make
your
way
with
the
big
wig
,
lord
and
earl
and
them
like
,
and
you
get
return
for
a
rotten
borough
;
 
you
will
excuse
me
,
but
that
be
about
it
,
be
not
it
?
 
<EOS>
and
then
you
go
in
for
government
!
<EOS>
a
man
may
have
a
mission
to
govern
,
such
as
Washington
and
Cromwell
and
the
like
o
'
them
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
hear
of
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
a

governing
,
why
then
I
say
,
 
d

n
it

<EOS>
"
there
must
be
good
and
bad
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
get
to
change
a
deal
yet
,
Mr.
Finn
,
and
we
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
when
a
young
man
as
have
liberal
feeling
get
into
Parliament
,
he
should
not
be
snap
up
and
bring
into
the
govern
business
just
because
he
be
poor
and
want
a
salary
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
do
it
that
way
in
the
States
;
and
they
will
not
do
it
that
way
here
long
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
system
as
I
hate
,
and
not
you
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
well
,
good
-
bye
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
like
the
govern
business

and
find
it
suit
your
health

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
these
condolement
from
Mr.
Bunce
be
not
pleasant
,
but
they
set
him
think
.
<EOS>
He
feel
assured
that
Bunce
and
Quintus
Slide
and
Mr.
Turnbull
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
bunce
be
ignorant
.
<EOS>
Quintus
Slide
be
dishonest
.
<EOS>
Turnbull
be
greedy
of
popularity
.
<EOS>
for
himself
,
he
think
that
as
a
young
man
he
be
fairly
well
informed
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
mean
to
be
true
in
his
vocation
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
quite
sure
that
the
object
near
to
his
heart
in
politic
be
not
self
-
aggrandisement
,
but
the
welfare
of
the
people
in
general
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
could
not
but
agree
with
bunce
that
there
be
something
wrong
.
<EOS>
when
such
man
as
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
be
call
upon
to
act
as
governor
,
be
it
not
to
be
expect
that
the
ignorant
but
still
intelligent
bunce
of
the
population
should
 
"
d
 
n
it
all
"
?
  
<EOS>
on
the
evening
of
that
day
he
go
up
to
Mrs.
Low
's
,
very
sure
that
he
should
receive
some
encouragement
from
her
and
from
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
angry
with
him
because
he
have
put
himself
into
a
position
in
which
money
must
be
spend
and
none
could
be
make
.
<EOS>
the
Lows
,
especially
Mrs.
Low
,
have
refuse
to
believe
that
any
success
be
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
now
that
he
have
succeed
,
now
that
he
be
in
receipt
of
a
salary
on
which
he
could
live
and
save
money
,
he
would
be
sure
of
sympathy
from
his
old
friend
the
Lows
!
  
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Low
be
as
severe
upon
him
as
Mr.
Bunce
have
be
,
and
even
from
Mr.
Low
he
could
extract
no
real
comfort
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
I
congratulate
you

Mr.

coldly

well

you

Mr.

I

you
have
begin
at
the
wrong

<EOS>
I
think
so
before
,
and
I
think
so
still
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
ought
not
to
say
so
to
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury

but
if
you
ask
me
,
what
can
I
do
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
speak
the
truth
out

exactly
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
must
do
.
<EOS>
well
,
the
truth
be
,
Mr.
Finn
,
that
I
do
not
think
it
be
a
very
good
opening
for
a
young
man
to
be
make
what
they
call
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
,
 
unless
he
have
get
a
private
fortune
,
you
know
,
to
support
that
kind
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Phineas
,
a
ministry
be
such
an
uncertain
thing
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
be
uncertain
;
 
but
as
I
do
go
into
the
House
,
it
be
something
to
have
succeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
call
that
success
,
"
say
Mrs.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
intend
to
go
on
with
your
profession
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
tell
them
that
he
have
change
his
mind
,
and
that
he
mean
to
marry
Violet
Effingham
,
who
would
much
prefer
a
parliamentary
life
for
her
husband
to
that
of
a
work
barrister
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
be
all
give
up
now
,
"
continue
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
for
the
present
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
and
for
ever
I
fear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Low
,
"
You
will
never
go
back
to
real
work
after
fritter
away
your
time
as
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
.
<EOS>
what
sort
of
work
must
it
be
when
just
anybody
can
do
it
that
it
suit
them
to
lay
hold
of
?
<EOS>
but
of
course
a
thousand
a
year
be
something
,
though
a
man
may
have
it
for
only
six
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
come
out
in
the
course
of
the
evening
that
Mr.
Low
be
go
to
stand
for
the
borough
vacate
by
Mr.
Mottram
,
at
which
it
be
consider
that
the
Conservatives
may
possibly
prevail
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
after
all
,
Phineas
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
,
"
that
I
be
follow
your
step
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

ah
;
you
be
go
into
the
House
in
the
course
of
your
profession

"
just
so
,
"
say
Mrs.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
take
the
first
step
towards
be
a
Tory
Attorney
-
General
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
as
may
be
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
the
kind
of
thing
a
man
do
after
twenty
year
of
hard
work
.
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
really
do
not
care
much
whether
I
succeed
or
fail

I
should
like
to
live
to
be
a
Vice
-
Chancellor
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
say
as
much
as
that
to
you
.

but
I
be
not
at
all
sure
that
Parliament
be
the
good
way
to
the
Equity
Bench
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
it
be
a
grand
thing
to
get
into
Parliament
when
you
do
it
by
mean
of
your
profession
,
"
say
Mrs.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
that
Phineas
take
his
departure
from
the
house
,
feel
sore
and
unhappy
.
<EOS>
but
on
the
next
morning
he
be
receive
in
Grosvenor
Place
with
an
amount
of
triumph
which
go
far
to
compensate
him
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
write
to
him
to
call
there
,
and
on
his
arrival
he
find
both
Violet
Effingham
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
with
his
friend
.
<EOS>
when
Phineas
enter
the
room
his
first
feeling
be
one
of
intense
joy
at
see
that
Violet
Effingham
be
present
there
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
one
of
surprise
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
should
make
one
of
the
little
party
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
tell
him
at
Mr.
Palliser
's
dinner
-
party
that
they
,
in
Portman
Square
,
have
not
as
yet
advance
far
enough
to
receive
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
 
and
yet
here
be
the
lady
in
Mr.
Kennedy
's
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
now
Phineas
would
have
think
it
more
likely
that
he
should
find
her
in
Portman
Square
than
in
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
that
Madame
Goesler
have
be
bring
by
Miss
Effingham
,
 
with
the
consent
,
indeed
,
of
Lady
Laura
,
but
with
a
consent
give
with
much
of
hesitation
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
"
Violet
have
ask
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
of
nothing
,
"
Lady
Laura
have
answer
;
"
but
one
have
to
choose
one
's
acquaintance
in
accordance
with
rule
which
one
do
not
lay
down
very
strictly
.
"
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
clever
woman
,
"
say
Violet
,
"
and
everybody
like
her
;
but
if
you
think
Mr.
Kennedy
would
object
,
of
course
you
be
right
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lady
Laura
have
consent
,
tell
herself
that
it
be
not
necessary
that
she
should
ask
her
husband
's
approval
as
to
every
new
acquaintance
she
may
form
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
Violet
have
be
tell
that
Phineas
would
be
there
,
and
so
the
party
have
be
make
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
see
the
conquer
hero
come
,
"
say
Violet
in
her
cheery
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
that
Mr.
Finn
have
be
make
a
lord
of
something
,
"
say
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
pleasure
of
a
long
political
discussion
with
him
the
other
night
,
and
I
quite
approve
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
so
much
gratified
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
say
that
it
be
the
good
appointment
they
could
have
make
,
and
papa
be
quite
proud
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
Lord
Brentford
's
member
;
be
you
not
?
"
ask
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
question
which
Phineas
do
not
quite
like
,
and
which
he
be
oblige
to
excuse
by
remember
that
the
questioner
have
live
so
long
out
of
England
as
to
be
probably
ignorant
of
the
myth
,
and
theory
,
and
system
,
and
work
of
the
British
Constitution
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
,
little
as
she
know
of
politic
,
would
never
have
ask
a
question
so
imprudent
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
question
be
turn
off
,
and
Phineas
,
with
an
easy
grace
,
submit
himself
to
be
pet
,
and
congratulate
,
and
purr
over
,
and
almost
caress
by
the
three
lady
,
Their
good
-
natured
enthusiasm
be
at
any
rate
better
than
the
satire
of
Bunce
,
or
the
wisdom
of
Mrs.
Low
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
no
misgiving
as
to
Phineas
be
fit
for
governing
,
and
Violet
Effingham
say
nothing
as
to
the
short
-
live
tenure
of
minister
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
though
she
have
ask
an
indiscreet
question
,
thoroughly
appreciate
the
advantage
of
Government
pay
,
and
the
prestige
of
Government
power
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
lord
now
,
"
she
say
,
speak
,
as
be
customary
with
her
,
with
the
slight
possible
foreign
accent
,
"
and
you
will
be
a
president
soon
,
and
then
perhaps
a
secretary
.
<EOS>
the
order
of
promotion
seem
odd
,
but
I
be
tell
it
be
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
pleasant
to
succeed
,
of
course
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
let
the
success
be
ever
so
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
know
you
would
succeed
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
quite
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
be
we
not
,
Violet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
always
say
so
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
for
myself
I
do
not
venture
to
have
an
opinion
on
such
matter
.
<EOS>
Will
you
always
have
to
go
to
that
big
building
in
the
corner
,
Mr.
Finn
,
and
stay
there
from
ten
till
four
?
<EOS>
will
not
that
be
a
bore
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
a
half
-
holiday
on
Saturday
,
you
know
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
the
Lords
of
the
Treasury
have
to
take
care
of
the
money
?
"
ask
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
their
own
;
and
they
generally
fail
in
do
that
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
He
sit
there
for
a
considerable
time
,
wonder
whether
Mr.
Kennedy
would
come
in
,
and
wonder
also
as
to
what
Mr.
Kennedy
would
say
to
Madame
Max
Goesler
when
he
do
come
in
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
it
be
useless
for
him
to
expect
any
opportunity
,
then
or
there
,
of
be
alone
for
a
moment
with
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
His
only
chance
in
that
direction
would
be
in
some
crowded
room
,
at
some
ball
at
which
he
may
ask
her
to
dance
with
him
;
but
it
seem
that
fate
be
very
unkind
to
him
,
and
that
no
such
chance
come
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
do
not
appear
,
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
with
Violet
go
away
,
leave
Phineas
still
sit
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
each
of
them
say
a
kind
word
to
him
as
they
go
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
I
may
dare
to
expect
that
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
will
come
and
see
me
?
"
say
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
then
Phineas
make
a

not

headed

You
tell
me
that
you

that
you
be
ambitious
for
me

why
be
it
that
you

<EOS>

be
it
not
reasonable

I

also

Phineas

who
be
to

<EOS>
have
a

how

sever

fatally
injure

It
seem
to
me
now
that

be
almost
the
only
man
in
London

have
not

of
this
duel

<EOS>
"

have
half
make
up

"
do
not

Mr.

there
can

day

Oswald

Lady

It
be
out
of
my

<EOS>
"
very
well

<EOS>
the
matter
shall
be
what
you
member
of
Parliament
call
an
open
question
between
us
.
<EOS>
when
papa
ask
you
to
accept
this
place
at

Treasury
,
do
it
ever
occur
to
you
to
refuse
it

It
do
;
 
for
half
an
hour

so

<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
would
,
 
and
yet
I
know
that
I
be
wrong

<EOS>
I
think
that
you
should
count
yourself
to
be
worth
more
than
that
,
and
that
you
should
,
as
it
be
,
assert
yourself
.
<EOS>
but
then
it
be
so
difficult
to
draw
the
line
between
proper
self
-
assertion
and
proper
self
-
denial
;
 
to
know
how
high
to
go
up
the
table

how
low
to
go
down

<EOS>
I
do
not

that
you

be
right

only
make

that
you
have
be
willing
to
be
a
junior
lord

anything
else
for
a
purpose
;

that
the
purpose
be
something
high
than
that
of
fetch

carry
in
Parliament
for
Mr.
Mildmay

Mr.
Palliser

<EOS>

I
hope
in

get
beyond

Phineas

you

Lady

draw
herself
up

speak

Mr.

nothing

honourable

so
early

<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
thank
his
friend

could
not
help
ask
himself
what
his
friend
have
do
to
be
make
a
Cabinet
Minister
.
<EOS>
little
as
he
,
Phineas
,
himself
have
do
in
the
House
in
his
two
session
and
a
half
,
Mr.
Kennedy
have
hardly
do
more
in
his
fifteen
or
twenty
.
<EOS>
but
then
Mr.
Kennedy
be
possess
of
almost
miraculous
wealth
,
and
own
half
a
county
,
whereas
he
,
Phineas
,
own
almost
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
of
course
no
Prime
Minister
would
offer
a
junior
lordship
at
the
Treasury
to
a
man
with
£
30,000
a
year
.
<EOS>
soon
after
this
Phineas
take
his
leave

<EOS>
"
I
think
he
will
do
well

Mr.

to
his

"
I
be
sure
he
will
do
well

Lady
Laura

almost
scornfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
quite
such
a
black
swan
with
me

he
be
with
you

but
still
I
think
he
will
succeed
,
if
he
take
care
of
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonish
how
that
absurd
story
of
his
duel
with
Chiltern
have
get
about

<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
prevent
people
talk

Lady
Laura

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
be
some
quarrel

neither

tell
you

They
say
it
be
about
Miss
Effingham

so
I
have

all
I

accuse
me
personally

really
you
make
such
a
jumble
of
it
all

with
papa

Sunday
afternoon
,
that
I
can
not
follow
what

<EOS>
then
Mr.

stand
for
awhile
,
collect
his
thought
,
so
that
he
may
unravel
the
jumble
,
if
that
be
possible

him

find
that
it
be
not
possible

he
leave
the
room

close
the
door
behind
him

<EOS>
then
Lady
Laura
be
leave
alone
to
consider
the
nature
of
the
accusation
which
her
husband
have
bring
against
her

the
nature
rather
of
the
accusation
which
she
have
choose
to
assert
that
her
husband
have
imply
.

for
in
her
heart
she
know
that
he
have
make
no
such
accusation
,

have
intend
to
make
none
such
.
<EOS>
the
idolatry
of
which
he
have
speak
be
the
idolatry
which
a

may
show
to
her
cat

her
dog
,
her
picture
,
her
china
,
her
furniture

her
carriage

her
pet
maid

servant

<EOS>
such
be
the
idolatry
of
which
Mr.

have
speak
;
 
but
be
there
no
other
worship
in
her
heart
,
bad
,
more
pernicious
than
that
,
in
reference
to
this
young
man

<EOS>
She
have
school
herself
about
him
very
severely

have
come
to
various
resolution

find
out

then
she
have
resolve
to
banish
him
from

have
go
the
length
of
tell
him
so

<EOS>
after
that

have
perceive

have
be

then
,
when
this
could
not
be
do
,
when
something
almost
like
idolatry
grow
upon
her
,
she
determine
that
it
should
be
the
idolatry
of
friendship
,
that
she
would
not
sin
even
in
thought
,
that
there
should
be
nothing
in
her
heart
of
which
she
nee
be
ashamed
;
 
but
that
the
one
great
object
and
purport
of
her
life
should
be
the
promotion
of
this
friend
's
welfare
.
<EOS>
She
have
just
begin
to
love
after
this
fashion
,
have
teach
herself
to
believe
that
she
may
combine
something
of
the
pleasure
of
idolatry
towards
her
friend
with
a
full
complement
of
duty
towards
her
husband
,
when
Phineas
come
to
her
with
his
tale
of
love
for
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
the
lesson
which
she
get
then
be
a
very
rough
one
,
 
so
hard
that
at
first
she
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
Her
anger
at
his
love
for
her
brother
's
wish
-
for
bride
be
lose
in
her
dismay
that
Phineas
should
love
any
one
after
have
once
love
her
.
<EOS>
but
by
sheer
force
of
mind
she
have
conquer
that
dismay
,
that
feeling
of
desolation
at
her
heart
,
and
have
almost
teach
herself
to
hope
that
Phineas
may
succeed
with
Violet
.
<EOS>
He
wish
it
,
 
and
why
should
he
not
have
what
he
wish
,
 
he
,
whom
she
so
fondly
idolise
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
his
fault
that
he
and
she
be
not
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
She
have
choose
to
arrange
it
otherwise
,
and
be
she
not
bind
to
assist
him
now
in
the
present
object
of
his
reasonable
wish
?
<EOS>
She
have
get
over
in
her
heart
that
difficulty
about
her
brother
,
but
she
could
not
quite
conquer
the
other
difficulty
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
plead
his
cause
with
Violet
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
bring
herself
as
yet
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
she
be
accuse
of
idolatry
for
Phineas
by
her
husband
,
 
<EOS>
she
with
"
a
lot
of
other
,
"
in
which
lot
Violet
be
of
course
include
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
well
that
they
two
should
be
bring
together
?
<EOS>
Would
not
her
friend
's
husband
still
be
her
friend
?
<EOS>
Would
she
not
then
forget
to
love
him
?
<EOS>
Would
she
not
then
be
safe
than
she
be
now
?
  
<EOS>
as
she
sit
alone
struggle
with
her
difficulty
,
she
have
not

him

Miss
Effingham
's
Four
Lovers
 
one
morning
early
in
June
Lady
Laura
call
at
Lady
Baldock
's
house
and
ask
for
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
the
servant
be
show
her
into
the
large
drawing
-
room
,
when
she
again
ask
specially
for
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
Miss
Effingham
be
there
,
"
say
the
man
,
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
be
sit
all
alone
,
and
Lady
Laura
perceive
that
she
have
be
catch
in
the
net
which
she
specially
wish
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
now
Lady
Baldock
have
not
actually
or
openly
quarrel
with
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
or
with
Lord
Brentford
,
but
she
have
conceive
a
strong
idea
that
her
niece
Violet
be
countenance
in
all
impropriety
by
the
standish
family
generally
,
and
that
therefore
the
standish
family
be
to
be
regard
as
a
family
of
enemy
.
<EOS>
there
be
doubtless
in
her
mind
considerable
confusion
on
the
subject
,
for
she
do
not
know
whether
Lord
Chiltern
or
Mr.
Finn
be
the
suitor
whom
she
most
fear
,
 
and
she
be
aware
,
after
a
sort
of
muddled
fashion
,
that
the
claim
of
these
two
wicked
young
man
be
antagonistic
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
both
regard
by
her
as
emanation
from
the
same
source
of
iniquity
,
and
,
therefore
,
without
go
deeply
into
the
machination
of
Lady
Laura
,
 
without
resolve
whether
Lady
Laura
be
injure
her
by
press
her
brother
as
a
suitor
upon
Miss
Effingham
,
or
by
press
a
rival
of
her
brother
,
 
still
she
become
aware
that
it
be
her
duty
to
turn
a
cold
shoulder
on
those
two
house
in
Portman
Square
and
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
but
her
difficulty
in
do
this
be
very
great
,
and
it
may
be
say
that
Lady
Baldock
be
place
in
an
unjust
and
cruel
position
.
<EOS>
before
the
end
of
May
she
have
propose
to
leave
London
,
and
to
take
her
daughter
and
violet
down
to
Baddingham
,
 
or
to
Brighton
,
if
they
prefer
it
,
or
to
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
"
Brighton
in
June
!
"
<EOS>
Violet
have
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
Would
not
a

among

<EOS>
Miss
Boreham
have
say

"

not

me
keep
you

Violet
reply
;
"
but
I
do
not
think
I
shall
go
till
other
people
go

<EOS>
I
can
have
a
room
at
Laura
Kennedy
's
house
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lady
Baldock
,
whose
position
be
hard
and
cruel
,
resolve
that
she
would
stay
in
town
.
<EOS>
here
she
have
in
her
hand
a
ward
over
whom
she
have
no
positive
power
,
and
yet
in
respect
to
whom
her
duty
be
imperative
!
<EOS>
Her
duty
be
imperative
,
and
Lady
Baldock
be
not
the
woman
to
neglect
her
duty
;
 
and
yet
she
know
that
the
doing
of
her
duty
would
all
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Violet
would
marry
a
shoe
-
black
out
of
the
street
if
she
be
so
minded
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
that

with
two

two
most
excellent

two

content
Miss

there
be
Lord

a
young

not
very
rich
indeed

still
with
mean
sufficient
for
a

a

man
,

in
every
way
respectable

He

five

and
be

so
at

Lady

frequently
assert

violently
in

<EOS>
why

in

She

sometimes
she
will

out
quite

<EOS>
a

imprudent
old

Lady
Baldock

always
open

to
her
adversary

unable
to

herself
in

either

even

ago
,
 
in
love
with
another
lady
;
and
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
be
not
so
much
in
love
at
this
moment
but
what
he
be
able
to
intrust
his
cause
to
an
ambassador
.
<EOS>
none
short
of
a
royal
suitor
should
ever
do
that
with
success

have
he
never
plead
his
cause
to
you
himself

"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
never
tell
gentleman
's
secret

<EOS>
It
seem
that
if
he
have
,
his
success
be
so
trifling
that
he
have
think
he
have
well
trust
some
one
else
for
the
future

He
have
not
trust
me

He
have
not

me
any
commission

"
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
have
you
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
,
 
I
hardly
know
how
to
tell
his
story
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
thing
about
Oswald
which
make
it
almost
necessary
that
Mr.
Finn
should
explain
himself
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
all
;
 
about
their

foolish
young

I
be
not

all
about

they
so
wrong

<EOS>

I
can
not
answer
that

I
know
them
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
Chiltern
be
the
one
in
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
odd
that
you
should
have
throw
your

<EOS>
"
I
have
not
throw
my
brother
over

Will
you
accept
Oswald

ask

I
want
him
to
succeed

the

such

<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
's
Bill
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
necessary
that
we
should
go
back
in
our
story
for
a
very
short
period
in
order
that
the
reader
may
be
tell
that
Phineas
Finn
be
duly
re
-
elect
at
Loughton
after
his
appointment
at
the
Treasury
Board
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
little
trouble
at
Loughton
,
and
something
more
of
expense
than
he
have
before
encounter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
absolutely
come
down
,
and
be
propose
by
Mr.
Vellum
for
the
borough
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vellum
be
a
gentleman
learn
in
the
law
,
and
hostile
to
the
interest
of
the
noble
owner
of
Saulsby
,
be
able
to
raise
a
little
trouble
against
our
hero
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slide
be
propose
by
Mr.
Vellum
,
and
second
by
Mr.
Vellum
's
clerk
,
 
though
,
as
it
afterwards
appear
,
Mr.
Vellum
's
clerk
be
not
in
truth
an
elector
,
 
and
go
to
the
poll
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
He
receive
three
vote
,
and
at
twelve
o'clock
withdraw
.
<EOS>
this
in
itself
could
hardly
have
afford
compensation
for
the
expense
which
Mr.
Slide
or
his
backer
must
have
encounter
;
 
but
he
have
an
opportunity
of
make
a
speech
,
every
word
of
which
be
report
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
;
and
if
the
speech
be
make
in
the
language
give
in
the
report
,
Mr.
Slide
be
really
possess
of
some
oratorical
power
.
<EOS>
Most
of
those
who
read
the
speech
in
the
column
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
be
probably
not
aware
how
favourable
an
opportunity
of
retouch
his
sentence
in
type
have
be
give
to
Mr.
Slide
by
the
fact
of
his
connection
with
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
the
speech
have
be
very
severe
upon
our
hero
;
and
though
the
speaker
have
be
so
hoot
and
pelt
at
Loughton
as
to
have
be
altogether
inaudible
,
 
so
maltreated
that
in
point
of
fact
he
have
not
be
able
to
speak
above
a
tenth
part
of
his
speech
at
all
,
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
the
speech
do
give
Phineas
a
certain
amount
of
pain
.
<EOS>
why
Phineas
should
have
read
it
who
can
tell
?
<EOS>
but
who
be
there
that
abstain
from
read
that
which
be
print
in
abuse
of
himself
?
  
<EOS>
in
the
speech
as
it
be
print
Mr.
Slide
declare
that
he
have
no
thought
of
be
return
for
the
borough
.
<EOS>
He
know
too
well
how
the
borough
be
manage
,
what
slave
the
elector
be
;
 
how
they
groan
under
a
tyranny
from
which
hitherto
they
have
be
unable
to
release
themselves
.
<EOS>
of
course
the
Earl
's
nominee
,
his
lacquey
,
as
the
honourable
gentleman
may
be
call
,
would
be
return
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
could
order
them
to
return
whichever
of
his
lacquey
he
please
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
peculiarly
pleasing
to
the
democratic
ear
in
the
word
lacquey
!
<EOS>
any
one
serve
a
big
man
,
whatever
the
service
may
be
,
be
the
big
man
's
lacquey
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
.
 
<EOS>
the
speech
throughout
be
very
bitter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
,
who
have
previously
serve
in
Parliament
as
the
lacquey
of
an
irish
earl
,
and
have
be
turn
off
by
him
,
have
now
fall
into
the
service
of
the
English
earl
,
and
be
the
lacquey
choose
for
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
he
,
Quintus
Slide
,
who
boast
himself
to
be
a
man
of
the
people
,
 
he
could
tell
them
that
the
day
of
their
thraldom
be
come
to
an
end
,
and
that
their
enfranchisement
be
near
at
hand
.
<EOS>
that
friend
of
the
people
,
Mr.
Turnbull
,
have
a
clause
in
his
breech
-
pocket
which
he
would
either
force
down
the
unwilling
throat
of
Mr.
Mildmay
,
or
else
drive
the
imbecile
Premier
from
office
by
carry
it
in
his
tooth
.
<EOS>
Loughton
,
as
Loughton
,
must
be
destroy
,
but
it
should
be
bear
again
in
a
well
birth
as
a
part
of
a
real
electoral
district
,
send
a
real
member
,
choose
by
a
real
constituency
,
to
a
real
Parliament
.
<EOS>
in
those
day
,
 
and
they
would
come
soon
,
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
rather
think
that
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
would
be
find
"
nowhere
,
"
and
he
rather
think
also
that
when
he
show
himself
again
,
as
he
certainly
should
do
,
in
the
midst
of
that
democratic
electoral
district
as
the
popular
candidate
for
the
honour
of
represent
it
in
Parliament
,
that
democratic
electoral
district
would
accord
to
him
a
reception
very
different
from
that
which
he
be
now
receive
from
the
Earl
's
lacquey
in
the
parliamentary
village
of
Loughton
.
<EOS>
a
pretty
bit
of
fiction
than
these
sentence
as
compose
a
part
of
any
speech
deliver
,
or
propose
to
be
deliver
,
at
Loughton
,
Phineas
think
he
have
never
see
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
read
at
the
close
of
the
speech
that
though
the
Earl
's
hire
bully
do
their
bad
,
the
remark
of
Mr.
Slide
be
receive
by
the
people
with
reiterate
cheering
,
he
throw
himself
back
in
his
chair
at
the
Treasury
and
roar
.
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
have
be
three
minute
on
his
leg
,
have
receive
three
rotten
egg
,
and
one
dead
dog
,
and
have
retire
.
<EOS>
but
not
the
half
of
the
speech
as
print
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
have
be
quote
.
<EOS>
the
sin
of
Phineas
,
who
in
spite
of
his
inability
to
open
his
mouth
in
public
have
be
make
a
Treasury
hack
by
the
aristocratic
influence
,
 
"
by
aristocratic
influence
not
confine
to
the
male
sex
,
"
 
be
describe
at
great
length
,
and
in
such
language
that
Phineas
for
a
while
be
fool
enough
to
think
that
it
would
be
his
duty
to
belabour
Mr.
Slide
with
a
horsewhip
.
<EOS>
this
notion
,
however
,
do
not
endure
long
with
him
,
and
when
Mr.
Monk
tell
him
that
thing
of
that
kind
come
as
a
matter
of
course
,
he
be
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
find
it
much
more
difficult
to
obtain
comfort
when
he
weigh
the
argument
bring
forward
against
the
abomination
of
such
a
borough
as
that
for
which
he
sit
,
and
reflect
that
if
Mr.
Turnbull
bring
forward
his
clause
,
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
would
be
bind
to
vote
against
the
clause
,
know
the
clause
to
be
right
,
because
he
be
a
servant
of
the
Government
.
<EOS>
the
argument
,
even
though
they
appear
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
be
true
argument
;
and
he
have
on
one
occasion
admit
their
truth
to
his
friend
Lady
Laura
,
 
in
the
presence
of
that
great
Cabinet
Minister
,
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
what
business
have
such
a
man
as
that
down
there
?
<EOS>
be
there
a
single
creature
who
want
him
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
anybody
do
want
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
,
"
Phineas
have
reply
;
"
but
I
be
dispose
to
think
the
elector
should
choose
the
man
they
do
want
,
and
that
at
present
they
have
no
choice
leave
to
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
They
be
quite
satisfied
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
,
Lady
Laura
,
"
continue
Phineas
,
"
that
alone
should
be
sufficient
to
prove
that
their
privilege
of
return
a
member
to
Parliament
be
too
much
for
them
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
defend
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
be
defend
by
tradition
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
and
by
its
great
utility
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
bow
to
the
young
member
who
be
present
,
and
forget
that
very
useless
old
gentleman
,
her
cousin
,
who
have
sit
for
the
borough
for
many
year
.
<EOS>
"
in
this
country
it
do
not
do
to
go
too
fast
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
and
then
the
mixture
of
vulgarity
,
falsehood
,
and
pretence
!
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
shudder
as
her
mind
recur
to
the
fact
that
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
have
contaminate
Loughton
by
his
presence
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
that
they
hardly
let
him
leave
the
place
alive
.
"
  
<EOS>
whatever
Mr.
Kennedy
and
Lady
Laura
may
think
about
Loughton
and
the
general
question
of
small
borough
,
it
be
find
by
the
Government
,
to
their
great
cost
,
that
Mr.
Turnbull
's
clause
be
a
reality
.
<EOS>
after
two
month
of
hard
work
,
all
question
of
franchise
have
be
settle
,
rating
and
renting
,
new
and
newfangled
,
fancy
franchise
and
those
which
no
one
fancy
,
franchise
for
borough
and
franchise
for
county
,
franchise
single
,
dual
,
three
-
cornered
,
and
four
-
sided
,
 
by
various
clause
to
which
the
Committee
of
the
whole
House
have
agree
after
some
score
of
division
,
 
the
matter
of
the
franchise
have
be
settle
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
there
be
the
House
of
Lords
,
and
there
may
yet
be
shipwreck
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
generally
believe
that
the
Lords
would
hardly
look
at
the
bill
,
 
that
they
would
not
even
venture
on
an
amendment
.
<EOS>
the
Lords
would
only
be
too
happy
to
let
the
matter
be
settle
by
the
Commons
themselves
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
after
the
franchise
,
come
redistribution
.
<EOS>
how
sick
of
the
subject
be
all
member
of
the
Government
,
no
one
could
tell
who
do
not
see
their
weary
face
.
<EOS>
the
whole
House
be
sick
,
have
be
whip
into
various
lobby
,
night
after
night
,
during
the
heat
of
the
summer
,
for
week
past
.
<EOS>
redistribution
!
<EOS>
why
should
there
be
any
redistribution
?
<EOS>
They
have
get
,
or
would
get
,
a
beautiful
franchise
.
<EOS>
Could
they
not
see
what
that
would
do
for
them
?
<EOS>
why
redistribute
anything
?
<EOS>
but
,
alas
,
it
be
too
late
to
go
back
to
<EOS>
so
bless
an
idea
as
that
!
<EOS>
redistribution
they
must
have
.
<EOS>
but
there
should
be
as
little
redistribution
as
possible
.
<EOS>
man
be
sick
of
it
all
,
and
would
not
be
exigeant
.
<EOS>
something
should
be
do
for
overgrown
county
;
 
something
for
new
town
which
have
prosper
in
brick
and
mortar
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
easy
to
crush
up
a
peccant
borough
or
two
,
 
a
borough
that
have
be
discover
in
its
sin
.
<EOS>
and
a
few
borough
now
bless
with
two
member
may
consent
to
be
bless
only
with
one
.
<EOS>
fifteen
small
clause
may
settle
the
redistribution
,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Turnbull
,
 
if
only
Mr.
Daubeny
would
be
good
-
natured
.
  
<EOS>
neither
the
weather
,
which
be
very
hot
,
nor
the
tedium
of
the
session
,
which
have
be
very
great
,
nor
the
anxiety
of
Ministers
,
which
be
very
pressing
,
have
any
effect
in
impair
the
energy
of
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
instant
,
as
oratorical
,
as
hostile
,
as
indignant
about

<EOS>
Phineas

who
reply
to
this
,
and
who
tell
Mr.
Turnbull
that
he
himself
could
not
answer
for
any
peer
,
 
but
that
he
think
it
probable
that
most
peer
would
,
by
their
opinion
,
somewhat
influence
the
opinion
of
some
elector
,
 
be
think
to
have
get
out
of
his
difficulty
very
well
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
the
clause
of
Mr.
Turnbull
to
be
deal
with
,
 
a
clause
directly
disfranchise
seven
single
-
wing
borough
,
of
which
Loughton
be
of
course
one
,
 
a
clause
to
which
the
Government
must
either
submit
or
object
.
<EOS>
submission
would
be
certain
defeat
in
one
way
,
and
objection
would
be
as
certain
defeat
in
another
,
 
if
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
be
not
dispose
to
assist
the
minister
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
the
Cabinet
be
divide
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
and
Mr.
Monk
be
for
let
the
seven
borough
go
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
could
not
bring
himself
to
obey
Mr.
Turnbull
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
support
him
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Mildmay
be
tell
that
Mr.
Daubeny
would
certainly
go
into
the
same
lobby
with
Mr.
Turnbull
respect
the
seven
borough
,
he
be
report
to
have
say
that
in
that
case
Mr.
Daubeny
must
be
prepare
with

<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
make
a
beautiful
speech
about
the
seven
borough
;
 
the
seven
sin
,
and
seven
star
,
and
seven
church
,
and
seven
lamp
.
<EOS>
He
would
make
no
party
question
of
this
.
<EOS>
gentleman
who
usually
act
with
him
would
vote
as
their
own
sense
of
right
or
wrong
direct
them
;
 
from
which
expression
of
a
special
sanction
it
be
consider
that
these
gentleman
be
not
accustom
to
exercise
the
privilege
now
accord
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
in
regard
the
question
as
one
of
right
and
wrong
,
and
in
look
at
what
he
believe
to
be
both
the
wish
of
the
country
and
its
interest
,
he
,
Mr.
Daubeny
,
 
he
,
himself
,
be
simply
a
humble
member
of
that
House
,
 
must
support
the
clause
of
the
honourable
gentleman
.
<EOS>
almost
all
those
to
whom
have
be
surrender
the
privilege
of
use
their
own
judgment
for
that
occasion
only
,
use
it
discreetly
,
 
as
their
chief
have
use
it
himself
,
 
and
Mr.
Turnbull
carry
his
clause
by
a
majority
of
fifteen
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
3
a.m.
,
and
Mr.
Gresham
,
rise
after
the
division
,
say
that
his
right
honourable
friend
the
First
Lord
of
the
Treasury
be
too
tired
to
return
to
the
House
,
and
have
request
him
to
state
that
the
Government
would
declare
their
purpose
at
6
p.m.
on
the
follow
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
though
he
have
make
his
little
speech
in
answer
to
Mr.
Turnbull
with
good
-
humoured
flippancy
,
have
record
his
vote
in
favour
of
the
seven
borough
with
a
sore
heart
.
<EOS>
much
as
he
dislike
Mr.
Turnbull
,
he
know
that
Mr.
Turnbull
be
right
in
this
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
to
Mr.
Monk
on
the
subject
,
as
it
be
ask
Mr.
Monk
's
permission
to
throw
up
his
office
,
and
vote
against
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Monk
be
angry
with
him
,
tell
him
that
his
conscience
be
of
that
restless
,
uneasy
sort
which
be
neither
useful
nor
manly
.
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
,
"
and
none
well
than
Mr.
Mildmay
,
that
we
can
not
justify
such
a
borough
as
Loughton
by
the
theory
of
our
parliamentary
representation
,
 
any
more
than
we
can
justify
the
fact
that
Huntingdonshire
should
return
as
many
member
as
the
East
Riding
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
compromise
,
and
you
should
trust
to
other
who
have
study
the
matter
more
thoroughly
than
you
,
to
say
how
far
the
compromise
should
go
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
influence
of
the
peer
,
not
the
paucity
of
the
elector
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
have
no
peer
any
influence
in
a
county
?
<EOS>
Would
you
disfranchise
Westmoreland
?
<EOS>
believe
me
,
Finn
,
if
you
want
to
be
useful
,
you
must
submit
yourself
in
such
matter
to
those
with
whom
you
act
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
have
no
answer
to
make
,
but
he
be
not
happy
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
the
less
happy
,
perhaps
,
because
he
be
very
sure
that
Mr.
Mildmay
would
be
beat
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
in
these
day
harass
him
sorely
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
be
very
keen
against
such
borough
as
Loughton
,
declare
that
Mr.
Daubeny
be
quite
right
to
join
his
standard
to
that
of
Mr.
Turnbull
on
such
an
issue
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
be
the
reformer
now
,
and
Phineas
find
himself
oblige
to
fight
a
lose
battle
on
behalf
of
an
acknowledge
abuse

<EOS>
He
never
go
near
bunce
;
but
,
unfortunately
for
him
,
Bunce
catch
him
once
in
the
street

show
him
no

it

away
at

<EOS>
I
hope
we
may

<EOS>
It
be
well
than
be
member
for
Loughton
,
Mr.
Finn
;
 
you
may
be
sure
of
that
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
Mr.
Bunce
pass
on
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
carry
his
clause
,
and
Loughton
be
doom
.
<EOS>
Loughton
and
the
other
six
deadly
sin
be
anathematize
,
exorcise
,
and
finally
get
rid
of
out
of
the
world
by
the
voice
of
the
gentleman
who
have
be
proclaim
the
beauty
of
such
pleasant
vice
all
their
life
,
and
who
in
their
heart
hate
all
change
that
tend
towards
popular
representation
.
<EOS>
but
not
the
less
be
Mr.
Mildmay
beat
;
and
,
in
accordance
with
the
promise
make
by
his
first
lieutenant
immediately
after
the
vote
be
take
,
the
Prime
Minister
come
forward
on
the
next
evening
and
make
his
statement
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
put
his
resignation
into
the
hand
of
Her
Majesty
,
and
Her
Majesty
have
graciously
accept
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
old
,
and
feel
that
the
time
have
come
in
which
it
behove
him
to
retire
into
that
leisure
which
he
think
he
have
,
perhaps
,
earn
.
<EOS>
He
have
hope
to
carry
this
bill
as
the
last
act
of
his
political
life
;
but
he
be
too
old
,
too
stiff
,
as
he
say
,
in
his
prejudice
,
to
bend
further
than
he
have
bent
already
,
and
he
must
leave
the
completion
of
the
matter
in
other
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
Majesty
have
send
for
Mr.
Gresham
,
and
Mr.
Gresham
have
already
see
Her
Majesty
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
and
his
other
colleague
,
though
they
dissent
from
the
clause
which
have
be
carry
by
the
united
effort
of
gentleman
opposite
to
him
,
and
of
gentleman
below
him
on
his
own
side
of
the
House
,
be
young
man
than
he
,
and
would
,
for
the
country
's
sake
,
 
and
for
the
sake
of
Her
Majesty
,
 
endeavour
to
carry
the
bill
through
.
<EOS>
there
would
then
,
of
course
,
be
a
dissolution
,
and
the
future
Government
would
,
no
doubt
,
depend
on
the
choice
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
from
all
which
it
be
understand
that
Mr.
Gresham
be
to
go
on
with
the
bill
to
a
conclusion
,
whatever
may
be
the
division
carry
against
him
,
and
that
a
new
Secretary
of
State
for
Foreign
Affairs
must
be
choose
.
<EOS>
Phineas
understand
,
also
,
that
he
have
lose
his
seat
at
Loughton
.
<EOS>
for
the
borough
of
Loughton
there
would
never
again
be
an
election
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
be
Mr.
Mildmay
,
I
would
have
throw
the
bill
up
altogether
,
"
Lord
Brentford
say
afterwards
;
"
but
of
course
it
be
not
for
me
to
interfere
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
session
be
protract
for
two
month
after
that
,
 
beyond
the
time
at
which
grouse
should
have
be
shoot
,
 
and
by
the
23rd
of
August
become
the
law
of
the
land

<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
get
over
it

say
Mr.
Ratler
to
Mr.

,
seat
one
terribly
hot
evening
on
a
bench
behind
the
Cabinet
Ministers

"
<EOS>
never
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
such
a
session
for
work
be
ever
know
before
.
<EOS>
think
what
it
be
to
have
to
keep
man
together
in
August
,
with
the
thermometer
at
81
°
,
and
the
river
stinking
like
,
 
like
the
very
mischief
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
,
however
,
do
not
die
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
last
day
of
the
session
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
resign
.
<EOS>
Rumours
reach
the
ear
of
Phineas
as
to
the
cause
of
this
,
but
no
certain
cause
be
tell
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
Lord
Cantrip
have
insist
upon
it
,
Laurence
have
by
mischance
be
call
upon
for
some
official
statement
during
an
unfortunate
period
of
absence
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
a
mystery
about
it
;
 
but
the
mystery
be
not
half
so
wonderful
as
the
triumph
to
Phineas
,
when
Mr.
Gresham
offer
him
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
shall
have
no
seat
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
none
of
us
have
seat
to
-
morrow
,
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
shall
be
at
a
loss
to
find
a
place
to
stand
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
election
will
not
come
on
till
November
,
and
you
must
look
about
you

<EOS>
both
Mr.
Monk
and
Lord
Brentford
seem
to
think
you
will
be
in
the
House

<EOS>
and
so
the
bill
be
carry
,
and
the
session
be
end

<EOS>
"
the

by
the
middle
of
September
there
be

a
large
party
at
Matching
Priory

a
country
mansion

to
Mr.
Plantagenet
Palliser
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
certainly
be
choose
in
reference
to
their
political
feeling
and
position
,
 
for
there
be
not
a
guest
in
the
house
who
have
vote
for
Mr.
Turnbull
's
clause
,
or
the
wife
or
daughter
,
or
sister
of
any
one
who
have
so
vote
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
in
these
day
politic
run
so
high
that
among
politician
all
social
gathering
be
bring
together
with
some
reference
to
the
state
of

<EOS>
Phineas
be
invite
,
and
when
he
arrive
at
Matching
he
find
that
half
the
Cabinet
be
there
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
be
not
there
,
nor
be
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
be
there
,
and
the
Duke
,
 
with
the
Duchess
,
and
Mr.
Gresham
,
and
Lord
Thrift
;
Mrs.
Max
Goesler
be
there
also
,
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
 
Mr.
Bonteen
be
detain
somewhere
out
of
the
way
;
and
Violet
Effingham
be
expect
in
two
day
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
at
the
end
of
the
week
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
take
an
opportunity
of
impart
this
latter
information
to
Phineas
very
soon
after
his
arrival
;
and
Phineas
,
as
he
watch
her
eye
and
her
mouth
while
she
speak
,
be
quite
sure
that
Lady
Glencora
know
the
story
of
the
duel
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
to
see
him
again
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
right
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
there
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grey
,
who
be
great
friend
of
the
Pallisers
,
 
and
on
the
very
day
on
which
Phineas
reach
Matching
,
at
half
an
hour
before
the
time
for
dressing
,
the
Duke
of
Omnium
arrive
.
<EOS>
now
,
Mr.
Palliser
be
the
Duke
's
nephew
and
heir
,
 
and
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
a
very
great
person
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
why
it
should
have
be
so
,
but
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
certainly
a
great
man
in
public
estimation
than
the
other
duke
then
present
,
 
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
be
a
useful
man
,
and
have
be
so
all
his
life
,
sit
in
Cabinets
and
serve
his
country
,
constant
as
any
peer
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
always
ready
to
take
on
his
own
shoulder
any
troublesome
work
require
of
him
,
than
whom
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
Mr.
Mildmay
's
predecessor
at
the
head
of
the
liberal
party
,
have
have
no
more
devoted
adherent

the
Duke
of
Omnium
have
never
yet
do
a
day
's
work
on
behalf
of
his
country
.
<EOS>
They
both
wear
the
Garter
,
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
have
earn
it
by
service
,
the
Duke
of
omnium
have
be
decorate
with
the
blue
ribbon
,
 
because
he
be
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
the
one
be
a
moral
,
good
man
,
a
good
husband
,
a
good
father
,
and
a
good
friend
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
 
do
not
bear
quite
so
high
a
reputation
.
<EOS>
but
man
and
woman
think
but
little
of
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
while
the
other
duke
be
regard
with
an
almost
reverential
awe
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
secret
lie
in
the
simple
fact
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
have
not
be
common
in
the
eye
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
He
have
contrive
to
envelope
himself
in
something
of
the
ancient
mystery
of
wealth
and
rank
.
<EOS>
within
three
minute
of
the
Duke
's
arrival
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
with
an
air
of
great
importance
,
whisper
a
word
to
Phineas
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
come
.
<EOS>
He
arrive
exactly
at
seven
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
have
come
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Duke
of
Omnium
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
almost
reprimand
him
by
her
tone
of
voice
for
his
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
a
great
doubt
whether
or
no
he
would
show
himself
at
last
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
tell
me
that
he
never
will
pledge
himself
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
glad
he
have
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
ever
see
him
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
have
see
him
,
 
a
magnificent
-
looking
man
!
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
so
very
nice
of
Lady
Glencora
get
him
to
meet
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
rarely
that
he
will
join
in
a
great
party
,
but
they
say
Lady
Glencora
can
do
anything
with
him
since
the
heir
be
bear
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
hear
all
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Phineas
;
"
I
have
hear
nothing
of
the
heir
,
but
I
know
that
there
be
three
or
four
baby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
heir
,
you
know
,
for
a
year
and
a
half
,
and
they
be
all
au
désespoir
;
and
the
Duke
be
very
nearly
quarrel
with
his
nephew
;
and
Mr.
Palliser
 
;
you
know
it
have
very
nearly
come
to
a
separation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
anything
at
all
about
it
,
"
say
Phineas
,
who
be
not
very
fond
of
the
lady
who
be
give
him
the
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
,
I
can
assure
you
;
but
since
the
boy
be
bear
Lady
Glencora
can
do
anything
with
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
She
make
him
go
to
Ascot
last
spring
,
and
he
present
her
with
the
favourite
for
one
of
the
race
on
the
very
morning
the
horse
run
.
<EOS>
They
say
he
give
three
thousand
pound
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
Lady
Glencora
win
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
the
horse
lose
;
and
Mr.
Palliser
have
never
know
what
to
do
with
him
since
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
very
pretty
of
the
Duke
;
 
be
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
though
he
have
intend
to
show
to
Mrs.
Bonteen
<EOS>
how
little
he
think
about
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
 
how
small
be
his
respect
for
a
great
peer
who
take
no
part
in
politic
,
 
could
not
protect
himself
from
a
certain
feeling
of
anxiety
as
to
the
aspect
and
gait
and
word
of
the
man
of
whom
people
think
so
much
,
of
whom
he
have
hear
so
often
,
and
of
whom
he
have
see
so
little
.
<EOS>
He
tell
himself
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
should
be
no
more
to
him
than
any
other
man
,
but
yet
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
more
to
him
than
other
man
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
down
into
the
drawing
-
room
he
be
angry
with
himself
,
and
stand
apart
;
 
and
be
then
angry
with
himself
again
because
he
stand
apart
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
make
a
difference
in
his
own
bearing
because
there
be
such
a
man
in
the
company
?
<EOS>
and
yet
he
could
not
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
when
he
enter
the
room
the
Duke
be
stand
in
a
large
bow
-
window
,
and
two
or
three
lady
and
two
or
three
man
be
stand
round
him
.
<EOS>
Phineas
would
not
go
near
the
group
,
tell
himself
that
he
would
not
approach
a
man
<EOS>
so
grand
as
be
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
He
see
Madame
Max
Goesler
among
the
party
,
and
after
a
while
he
see
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
as
she
retreat
,
Phineas
know
that
some
word
from
Madame
Max
Goesler
have
not
be
receive
with
the
graciousness
which
she
have
expect
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
prettiest
smile
in
the
world
on
the
lady
's
face
,
and
she
take
a
corner
on
a
sofa
with
an
air
of
perfect
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
but
yet
Phineas
know
that
she
have
receive
a
wound
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
call
twice
on
you
in
London
,
"
say
Phineas
,
come
up
close
to
her
,
"
but
be
not
fortunate
enough
to
find
you
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
but
you
come
so
late
in
the
season
as
to
make
it
impossible
that
there
should
be
any
arrangement
for
our
meeting
.
<EOS>
what
can
any
woman
do
when
a
gentleman
call
on
her
in
August
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
in
July
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
you
do
;
on
the
31st
.
<EOS>
I
keep
the
most
accurate
record
of
all
such
thing
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
but
let
us
hope
that
we
may
have
well
luck
next
year
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
we
can
only
enjoy
the
good
thing
that
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
socially
,
or
politically
,
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
socially
.
<EOS>
how
can
I
mean
anything
else
when
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
here
?
<EOS>
I
feel
so
much
tall
at
be
in
the
same
house
with
him
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
?
<EOS>
but
you
be
a
spoilt
child
of
fortune
,
and
perhaps
you
have
meet
him
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
once
see
the
back
of
a
hat
in
the
park
,
and
somebody
tell
me
that
the
Duke
's
head
be
inside
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
never
see
him
but
that
once
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
never
but
that
once
,
 
till
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
not
you
feel
elated
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
do
.
<EOS>
for
what
do
you
take
me
,
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
 
immensely
.
<EOS>
I
believe
him
to
be
a
fool
,
and
I
never
hear
of
his
do
a
kind
act
to
anybody
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
when
he
give
the
racehorse
to
Lady
Glencora
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
that
be
true
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
hear
of
such
an
absurdity
?
<EOS>
as
I
be
say
,
I
do
not
think
he
ever
do
anything
for
anybody
;
 
but
then
,
you
know
,
to
be
Duke
of
Omnium
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
necessary
,
 
be
it
,
 
that
a
Duke
of
omnium
should
do
anything
except
be
Duke
of
omnium
?
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
Lady
Glencora
come
up
to
Phineas
,
and
take
him
across
to
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
have
express
a
desire
to
be
introduce
to
him
.
<EOS>
phineas
,
half
-
pleased
and
half
-
disgusted
,
have
no
alternative
,
and
follow
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
shake
hand
with
him
,
and
make
a
little
bow
,
and
say
something
about
the
garrotter
,
which
Phineas
,
in
his
confusion
,
do
not
quite
understand
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
reply
as
he
would
have
reply
to
anybody
else
,
but
the
weight
of
the
Duke
's
majesty
be
too
much
for
him
,
and
he
bungle
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
make
another
little
bow
,
and
in
a
moment
be
speak
a
word
of
condescension
to
some
other
favour
individual
.
<EOS>
Phineas
retreat
altogether
disgust
,
 
hate
the
Duke
,
but
hate
himself
worse
;
but
he
would
not
retreat
in
the
direction
of
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
It
may
suit
that
lady
to
take
an
instant
little
revenge
for
her
discomfiture
,
but
it
do
not
suit
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
question
with
him
would
be
,
whether
in
some
future
part
of
his
career
it
may
not
be
his
duty
to
assist
in
put
down
duke
of
omnium
.
  
<EOS>
at
dinner
Phineas
sit
between
Mrs.
Bonteen
and
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
,
and
do
not
find
himself
very
happy
.
<EOS>
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
the
Duke
,
 
the
great
Duke
,
be
seat
at
Lady
Glencora
's
right
hand
,
and
on
his
other
side
Fortune
have
place
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
the
great
interest
which
Phineas
have
during
the
dinner
be
in
watch
the
operation
,
 
the
triumphantly
successful
operation
of
that
lady
.
<EOS>
before
dinner
she
have
be
wound
by
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
have
not
condescend
to
accord
the
honour
of
his
little
bow
of
graciousness
to
some
little
flattering
morsel
of
wit
which
the
lady
have
utter
on
his
behoof
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
a
sharp
word
or
two
in
her
momentary
anger
to
Phineas
;
but
when
Fortune
be
so
good
to
her
in
that
matter
of
her
place
at
dinner
,
she
be
not
fool
enough
to
throw
away
her
chance
.
<EOS>
throughout
the
soup
and
fish
she
be
very
quiet
.
<EOS>
She
say
a
word
or
two
after
her
first
glass
of
champagne
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
refuse
two
dish
,
one
after
another
,
and
then
she
glide
into
conversation
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
that
he
have
his
roast
mutton
before
him
she
be
in
full
play
,
and
as
she
eat
her
peach
,
the
Duke
be
bend
over
her
with
his
most
gracious
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
think
the
session
be
very
long
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
say
the
Duchess
to
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
long
indeed
,
Duchess
,
"
say
Phineas
,
with
his
attention
still
fix
on
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Duke
find
it
very
troublesome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
he
do
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
that
duke
and
that
duchess
be
no
more
than
any
other
man
and
any
other
man
's
wife
.
<EOS>
the
session
have
not
be
long
to
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
than
to
all
the
public
servant
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
the
great
possible
respect
for
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
but
he
could
not
take
much
interest
in
the
wailing
of
the
Duchess
on
her
husband
's
behalf
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
thing
do
seem
to
be
so
very
uncomfortable
now
,
"
say
the
Duchess
,
 
think
partly
of
the
resignation
of
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
partly
of
the
fact
that
her
own
old
peculiar
maid
who
have
live
with
her
for
thirty
year
have
retire
into
private
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
so
very
bad
,
Duchess
,
I
hope
,
"
say
Phineas
,
observe
that
at
this
moment
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
eye
be
brilliant
with
triumph
.
<EOS>
then
there
come
upon
him
a
sudden
ambition
,
 
that
he
would
like
to
"
cut
out
"
the
Duke
of
Omnium
in
the
estimation
of
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
the
brightness
of
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
eye
have
not
be
throw
away
upon
our
hero
.
  
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
come
at
the
appoint
time
,
and
,
to
the
surprise
of
Phineas
,
be
bring
to
matching
by
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
phinea
at
first
thought
that
it
be
intend
that
the
Earl
and
his
son
should
meet
and
make
up
their
quarrel
at
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
Brentford
stay
only
one
night
,
and
Phineas
on
the
next
morning
hear
the
whole
history
of
his
come
and
go
from
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
almost
be
on
my
knee
to
him
to
stay
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
do
go
on
my
knee
,
 
actually
on
my
knee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
put
his
arm
round
me
and
kiss
me
,
and
,
 
and
,
 
I
can
not
tell
you
all
that
he
say
.
<EOS>
but
it
end
in
this
,
 
that
if
Chiltern
can
be
make
to
go
to
Saulsby
,
fat
calf
without
stint
will
be
kill
.
<EOS>
I
shall
do
all
I
can
to
make
him
go
;
and
so
must
you
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
of
course
that
silly
affair
in
foreign
part
be
not
to
make
any
difference
between
you
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
smile
,
and
say
he
would
do
his
good
,
and
look
up
into
her
face
,
and
be
just
able
to
talk
to
her
as
though
thing
be
go
comfortably
with
him
.
<EOS>
but
his
heart
be
very
cold
.
<EOS>
as
Violet
have
speak
to
him
about
Lord
Chiltern
there
have
come
upon
him
,
for
the
first
time
,
 
for
the
first
time
since
he
have
know
that
Lord
Chiltern
have
be
refuse
,
 
an
idea
,
a
doubt
,
whether
even
yet
Violet
may
not
become
Lord
Chiltern
's
wife
.
<EOS>
His
heart
be
very
sad
,
but
he
struggle
on
,
 
declare
that
it
be
incumbent
on
them
both
to
bring
together
the
father
and
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
believe
that
you
can
do
more
towards
it
than
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
would
think
nothing
of
my
advice
,
 
would
hardly
speak
to
me
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
but
he
respect
you
as
well
as
like
you
,
and
not
the
less
because
of
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
Violet
should
know
aught
of
the
respect
or
like
<EOS>
feel
by
this
reject
suitor
for
that
other
suitor
,
 
who
have
also
be
reject
?
<EOS>
and
how
be
it
that
she
be
thus
able
to
talk
of
one
of
them
to
the
other
,
as
though
neither
of
them
have
ever
come
forward
with
such
a
suit
?
<EOS>
Phineas
feel
his
position
to
be
so
strange
as
to
be
almost
burdensome
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
Violet
,
when
she
have
refuse
him
,
very
plainly
,
that
he
should
come
again
to
her
,
and
ask
once
more
for
the
great
gift
which
he
covet
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
ask
again
now
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
there
be
that
in
her
manner
which
make
him
sure
that
be
he
to
do
so
,
he
would
ask
in
vain
;
and
then
he
feel
that
she
be
place
a
special
confidence
in
him
,
against
which
he
would
commit
a
sin
be
he
to
use
her
present
intimacy
with
him
for
the
purpose
of
make
love
.
<EOS>
They
two
be
to
put
their
shoulder
together
to
help
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
while
do
so
he
could
not
continue
a
suit
which
would
be
feel
by
both
of
them
to
be
hostile
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
opportunity
for
a
chance
word
,
and
if
so
the
chance
word
should
be
speak
;
but
he
could
not
make
a
deliberate
attack
,
such
as
he
have
make
in
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
Violet
also
probably
understand
that
she
have
not
now
be
catch
in
a
mousetrap
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
be
to
spend
four
day
at
Matching
,
and
on
the
third
day
,
 
the
day
before
Lord
Chiltern
be
expect
,
 
he
be
to
be
see
ride
with
Madame
Max
Goesler
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
be
know
as
a
perfect
horsewoman
,
 
one
indeed
who
be
rather
fond
of
go
a
little
fast
on
horseback
,
and
who
ride
well
to
hound
.
<EOS>
but
the
Duke
seldom
move
out
of
a
walk
,
and
on
this
occasion
Madame
Max
be
as
steady
in
her
seat
and
almost
as
slow
as
the
mount
ghost
in
_
Don
Juan
_
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
say
by
some
there
,
especially
by
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
that
the
conversation
between
them
be
not
slow
.
<EOS>
and
on
the
next
morning
the
Duke
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
be
together
again
before
luncheon
,
stand
on
a
terrace
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
look
down
on
a
party
who
be
play
croquet
on
the
lawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
never
play
?
"
say
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
;
 
one
do
everything
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
would
play
well
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
not

now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
I
shall
not
play
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
you
with
your
mallet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
your
grace
can
not
be
gratify
.
<EOS>
I
have
play
croquet
till
I
be
tired
of
it
,
and
have
come
to
think
it
be
only
fit
for
boy
and
girl
.
<EOS>
the
great
thing
be
to
give
them
opportunity
for
flirt
,
and
it
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
do
you
never
flirt
,
Madame
Goesler
?
"
  
"
never
at
croquet
,
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
with
you
be
the
choice
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
depend
on
so
many
thing
,
 
and
so
much
on
the
choose
person
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
recommend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
 
I
be
so
ignorant
.
<EOS>
I
can
recommend
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
to
a
mountain
-
top
at
dawn
on
a
summer
day
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
make
me
shiver
,
"
say
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
or
a
boat
on
a
lake
on
a
summer
evening
,
or
a
good
lead
after
hound
with
nobody
else
within
three
field
,
or
the
bottom
of
a
salt
-
mine
,
or
the
deck
of
an
ocean
steamer
,
or
a
military
hospital
in
time
of
war
,
or
a
railway
journey
from
Paris
to
Marseilles
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
you
have
the
most
uncomfortable
idea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
your
grace
have
try
each
of
them
,
 
successfully
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
,
after
all
,
a
comfortable
chair
over
a
good
fire
,
in
a
pretty
room
,
beat
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
do
,
 
certainly
,
"
say
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
then
he
whisper
something
at
which
Madame
Max
Goesler
blush
and
smile
,
and
immediately
after
that
she
follow
those
who
have
already
go
in
to
lunch
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bonteen
have
be
hover
round
the
spot
on
the
terrace
on
which
the
Duke
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
have
be
stand
,
look
on
with
envious
eye
,
meditate
some
attack
,
some
interruption
,
some
excuse
for
an
interpolation
,
but
her
courage
have
fail
her
<EOS>
and
she
have
not
dare
to
approach
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
have
know
nothing
of
the
hover
propinquity
of
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
but
Madame
Goesler
have
see
and
have
understand
it
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
"
she
say
afterwards
,
"
why
do
you
not
come
and
join
us
?
<EOS>
the
Duke
be
so
pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
two
be
company
,
and
three
be
none

"
say
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
who
in
her
anger
be
hardly
able
to
choose
her
word
quite
as
well
as
she
may
have
do
<EOS>
have
she
be
more
cool
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
Madame
Max
have
make
quite
a
new
conquest
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bonteen
to
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
pleased
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
with
apparently
unaffected
delight
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
such
a
great
thing
to
get
anybody
to
amuse
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
You
see
everybody
can
not
talk
to
him
,
and
he
will
not
talk
to
everybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
talk
enough
to
her
in
all
conscience

say
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
who
be
now
more
angry
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
the
Duellists
Meet
 
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
arrive
,
and
Phineas
be
a
little
nervous
as
to
their
meeting
.
<EOS>
He
come
back
from
shoot
on
the
day
in
question
,
and
be
tell
by
the
servant
that
Lord
Chiltern
be
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Phineas
go
into
the
billiard
-
room
in
his
knickerbocker
,
think
probably
that
he
may
be
there
,
and
then
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
at
last
into
the
library
,
 
but
Lord
Chiltern
be
not
to
be
find
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
come
across
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
see
him
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
he
be
with
me
half
an
hour
since
,
walk
round
the
garden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
be
he
?
<EOS>
come
;
 
tell
me
something
about
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
know
him
to
be
more
pleasant
.
<EOS>
He
would
give
no
promise
about
Saulsby
,
but
he
do
not
say
that
he
would
not
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
know
that
I
be
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
how
much
pleasure
I
should
have
in
see
you
two
together
,
 
as
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
laugh
,
and
say
you
be
the
good
fellow
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
be
oblige
to
be
explicit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
do
he
laugh
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
tell
me
,
but
I
suppose
it
be
because
he
be
think
of
a
little
trip
he
once
take
to
Belgium
,
and
he
perceive
that
I
know
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
who
tell
you
.
<EOS>
but
never
mind
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
ask
any
question
.
<EOS>
as
I
do
not
like
that
our
first
meeting
should
be
before
all
the
people
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
I
will
go
to
him
in
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
,
do
;
 
that
will
be
so
nice
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
send
his
card
up
by
a
servant
,
and
in
a
few
minute
be
stand
with
his
hand
on
the
lock
of
Lord
Chiltern
's
door
.
<EOS>
the
last
time
he
have
see
this
man
,
they
have
meet
with
pistol
in
their
hand
to
shoot
at
each
other
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
have
in
truth
do
his
very
good
to
shoot
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
the
cause
of
quarrel
be
the
same
between
them
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
not
give
up
Violet
,
and
have
no
intention
of
give
her
up
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
receive
no
intimation
whatever
from
his
rival
that
there
be
to
be
a
truce
between
them
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
indeed
write
in
friendship
to
Lord
Chiltern
,
but
he
have
receive
no
answer
;
 
and
nothing
of
certainty
be
to
be
gather
from
the
report
which
Violet
have
just
make
.
<EOS>
It
may
well
be
that
Lord
Chiltern
would
turn
upon
him
now
in
his
wrath
,
and
that
there
would
be
some
scene
which
in
a
strange
house
would
be
obviously
objectionable
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
have
resolve
that
even
that
would
be
well
than
a
chance
encounter
among
stranger
in
a
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
so
the
door
be
open
and
the
two
man
meet
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
old
fellow
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
then
all
doubt
be
over
,
and
in
a
moment
Phineas
be
shake
his
former
,
 
and
present
friend
,
warmly
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
so
we
have
come
to
be
<EOS>
an
Under
-
Secretary
have
we
?
 
<EOS>
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
get
into
harness
,
 
when
the
harness
offer
itself
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
deuce
of
a
bore
,
be
not
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
like
work
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
like
hunt
better
.
<EOS>
You
use
to
ride
as
if
you
do
.
<EOS>
there
be
Bonebreaker
back
again
in
the
stable
for
you
.
<EOS>
that
poor
fool
who
buy
him
could
do
nothing
with
him
,
and
I
let
him
have
his
money
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
why
you
should
have
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
be
the
big
fool
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
do
you
remember
when
that
brute
get
me
down
under
the
bank
in
the
river
?
<EOS>
that
be
about
the
near
touch
I
ever
have
.
<EOS>
Lord
bless
me
;
 
how
he
do
squeeze
me
!
<EOS>
so
here
you
be
;
 
stay
with
the
Pallisers
,
 
one
of
a
Government
party
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
you
go
to
do
for
a
seat
,
my
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
talk
about
that
yet
,
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
sore
subject
,
 
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
I
think
they
have
be
quite
right
,
you
know
,
to
put
Loughton
into
the
melting
-
pot
,
 
though
I
be
sorry
enough
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
right
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
yet
you
vote
against
it
,
old
chap
?
<EOS>
but
,
come
;
I
be
not
go
to
be
down
upon
you
.
<EOS>
so
my
father
have
be
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
he
be
here
for
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Violet
have
just
be
tell
me
.
<EOS>
You
and
he
be
as
good
friend
as
ever
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust
we
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
never
hear
of
that
little
affair
?
"
<EOS>
and
Lord
Chiltern
nod
his
head
,
intend
to
indicate
the
direction
of
Blankenberg
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
have
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
Violet
tell
me
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
know
that
she
have
hear
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
reason
to
suppose
as
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
so
do
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
her
myself
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
deuce
you
do
!
<EOS>
but
I
daresay
it
be
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
you
have
not
proclaim
it
at
Charing
Cross
,
and
then
nobody
would
have
believe
a
word
about
it
.
<EOS>
of
course
my
father
will
hear
it
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
to
Saulsby
,
I
hope
,
Chiltern
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
that
question
be
easy
ask
than
answer
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
true
that
the
great
difficulty
have
be
get
over
.
<EOS>
Laura
have
have
her
money
.
<EOS>
and
if
my
father
will
only
acknowledge
that
he
have
wrong
me
throughout
,
from
begin
to
end
,
I
will
go
to
Saulsby
to
-
morrow
;
 
and
would
cut
you
out
at
Loughton
the
next
day
,
only
that
Loughton
be
not
Loughton
any
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
expect
your
father
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
and
therefore
there
be
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
so
you
have
have
that
awfully
ponderous
Duke
here
.
<EOS>
how
do
you
get
on
with
him
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
admirably
.
<EOS>
He
condescend
to
do
something
which
he
call
shake
hand
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
the
great
old
dust
out
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
,
disrespectfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
he
take
any
notice
of
Violet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
that
I
observe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
ought
not
to
be
allow
into
the
same
room
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
after
that
there
be
a
short
pause
,
and
Phineas
feel
some
hesitation
in
speaking
of
Miss
Effingham
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
and
how
do
you
get

with

"
ask
Lord
Chiltern

<EOS>
here
be
a
question
for
a
man
to
answer
.
<EOS>
the
question
be
so
hard
to
be
answer
,
that
Phineas
do
not
at
first
make
any
attempt
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
exactly
the
ground
that
I

on

Lord
Chiltern

She

me
three

you

more
fortunate

"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
as
he
ask
his
question
,
look
full
into
Finn
's
face
in
a
manner
that
be
irresistible
.
<EOS>
His
look
be
not
one
of
anger
nor
even
of
pride
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
indeed
,
without
a
strong
dash
of
fun
.
<EOS>
but
such
as
it
be
it
show
Phineas
that
Lord
Chiltern
intend
to
have
an
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
he
at
last
,
"
I
have
not
be
more
fortunate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
have
change
your
mind
,
"
say
his
host
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
I
have
not
change
my
mind
,
"
say
Phineas
,
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
stand
it
then
?
<EOS>
come
;
 
let
us
be
honest
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
down
at
Willingford
that
I
would
quarrel
with
any
man
who
attempt
to
cut
me
out
with
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
You
make
up
your
mind
that
you
would
do
so
,
and
therefore
I
quarrel
with
you
.
<EOS>
but
we
can
not
always
be
fight
duel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
may
not
have
to
fight
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
it
would
be
absurd
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
that
what
we
do
be
absurd
.
<EOS>
but
upon
my
life
I
do
not
see
any
other
way
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
that
be
over
.
<EOS>
how
be
it
to
be
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
I
to
say
in
answer
to
that
?
"
ask
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
the
truth
.
<EOS>
You
have
ask
her
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
 
I
have
ask
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
she
have
refuse
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
she
have
refuse
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
mean
to
ask
her
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
;
 
if
I
ever
think
that
there
be
a
chance

<EOS>
indeed
,
Chiltern
,
I
believe
I
shall
whether
I
think
that
I
have
any
chance
or
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
we
start
fairly
,
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
shall
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
once
tell
you
that
I
never
would
;
 
but
<EOS>
that
be
long
before
I
suspect
that
you
would
enter
for
the
same
plate
.
<EOS>
what
a
man
say
on
such
a
matter
when
he
be
down
in
the
mouth
go
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
now
we
understand
each
other
,
and
you
have
better
go
and
dress
.
<EOS>
the
bell
ring
nearly
half
an
hour
ago
,
and
my
fellow
be
hang
about
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
interview
have
in
one
respect
be
very
pleasant
to
Phineas
,
and
in
another
it
have
be
very
bitter
.
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
him
to
know
that
he
and
Lord
Chiltern
be
again
friend
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
delight
to
him
to
feel
that
this
half
-
savage
but
high
-
spirited
young
nobleman
,
who
have
be
so
anxious
to
fight
with
him
and
to
shoot
him
,
be
nevertheless
ready
to
own
that
he
have
behave
well
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
have
in
fact
acknowledge
that
though
he
have
be
anxious
to
blow
out
our
hero
's
brain
,
he
be
aware
all
the
time
that
our
hero
be
a
good
sort
of
fellow
.
<EOS>
Phineas
understand
this
,
and
feel
that
it
be
pleasant
.
<EOS>
but
with
this
understanding
,
and
accompany
this
pleasure
,
there
be
a
conviction
in
his
heart
that
the
distance
between
Lord
Chiltern
and
Violet
would
daily
grow
to
be
less
and
still
less
,
 
and
that
Lord
Chiltern
could
afford
to
be
generous
.
<EOS>
if
Miss
Effingham
could
teach
herself
to
be
fond
of
Lord
Chiltern
<EOS>
,
what
have
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
to
offer
in
opposition
to
the
claim
of
such
a
suitor
?
  
<EOS>
that
evening
Lord
Chiltern
take
Miss
Effingham
out
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
Phineas
tell
himself
that
this
be
of
course
so
arrange
by
Lady
Glencora
,
with
the
express
view
of
serve
the
Saulsby
interest
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
nothing
to
him
at
the
moment
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
be
intrust
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
ambition
respect
Madame
Max
Goesler
;
but
that
for
the
time
be
in
abeyance
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
keep
his
eye
off
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
as
he
well
know
,
his
observation
of
her
must
be
quite
useless
.
<EOS>
He
know
beforehand
,
with
absolute
accuracy
,
the
manner
in
which
she
would
treat
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
kind
,
genial
,
friendly
,
confidential
,
nay
,
affectionate
;
and
yet
her
manner
would
mean
nothing
,
would
give
no
clue
to
her
future
decision
either
for
or
against
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
as
Phineas
think
,
a
peculiarity
with
Violet
Effingham
that
she
could
treat
her
reject
lover
as
dear
familiar
friend
immediately
after
her
rejection
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"

not

enough

I
do
not

<EOS>
It
be
arrange
that
Phineas
and
Lord
Chiltern
be
to
leave
Matching
together

<EOS>
Phineas
be
to
remain
at
his
office
all
October
,
and
in
November
the
general
election
be
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
what
he
have
hitherto
hear
about
a
future
seat
<EOS>
be
most
vague
,
but
he
be
to
meet
Ratler
and
Barrington
Erle
in
London
,
and
it
have
be
understand
that
Barrington
Erle
,
who
be
now
at
Saulsby
,
be
to
make
some
inquiry
as
to
that
group
of
borough
of
which
Loughton
at
this
moment
form
one
.

as
Loughton
be
the
small
of
four
borough
,
and
as
one
of
the
four
have
for
many
year
have
a
representative
of
its
own
,
Phineas
fear
that
no
success
would
be
find
there
.
<EOS>
in
his
present
agony
he
begin
to
think
that
there
may
be
a
strong
plea
make
for
a
few
private
seat
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
that
the
propriety
of
throw
Loughton
into
the
melting
-
pot
be
,
after
all
,
open
to
question
.
<EOS>
He
and
Lord
Chiltern
be
to
return
to
London
together
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
,
accord
to
his
present
scheme
,
be
to
proceed
at
once
to
Willingford
to
look
after
the
cub
-
hunting
.
<EOS>
nothing
that
either
Violet
or
Phineas
could
say
to
him
would
induce
him
to
promise
to
go
to
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
when
Phineas
press
it
,
he
be
tell
by
Lord
Chiltern
that
he
be
a
fool
for
his
pain
,
 
by
which
Phineas
understand
perfectly
well
that
when
Lord
Chiltern
do
go
to
Saulsby
,
he
,
Phineas
,
be
to
take
that
as
strong
evidence
that
everything
be
over

Violet
Effingham

when
Violet
express
her
eagerness

the
visit
should
be
make
,
she
be
stop
with
an
assurance
that
she
could
have
it
do
at

she
please
.
<EOS>
let
him
only
be
enable
to
carry
with
him
the
tiding
of
his
betrothal
,
and
he
would
start
for
his
father
's
house
without
an
hour
's
delay
.
<EOS>
but
this
authority
Violet
would
not
give
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
answer
her
after
this
fashion
she
could
only
tell
him
that
he
be
ungenerous
.
"
<EOS>
at
any
rate
I
be
not
false

what
I

from

pretty
nearly
all
his
history

know
more

affair
than
any
of
those
in

who
have
be
his
most
staunch
friend

"
of

you
will
get
a

as
he
take
his

if

it
at
all
,
they
never
throw
over
an
ally
so
useful
as
you
be

<EOS>
"
but
the
intention
be
that
in
this

nobody
shall
any

have
the
power
of
throw
over

not
throw
over

there
be
thing
one
may
not

here

that
be
taboo
by
a
sort
of
consent

that
without
any
reason

"
<EOS>
She
pause
again
,
and
Phineas
be
at
a
loss
to
think
what
be
the
subject
on
which
she
be
about
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Could
she
mean
 
?
<EOS>
no
;
she
could
not
mean
to
give
him
any
outward
plain
-
speak
sign
that
she
be
attach
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
peculiar
merit
of
this
man
that
he
be
not
vain
,
though
much
be
do
to
him
to
fill
him
with
vanity
;
and
as
the
idea
cross
his
brain
,
he
hate
himself
because
it
have
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
me
you
may
say
anything
,
Madame
Goesler
,
"
he
say
,
 
"
here
in
England
,
as
plainly
as
though
we
be
in
Vienna
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
say
it
in
English
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
then
in
French
,
blush
and
laugh
as
she
speak
,
 
almost
stammer
in
spite
of
her
usual
self
-
confidence
,
 
she
tell
him
that
accident
have
make
her
rich
,
full
of
money
.
<EOS>
money
be
a
drug
with
her
.
<EOS>
money
she
know
be
want
,
even
for
householder
.
<EOS>
Would
he
not
understand
her
,
and
come
to
her
,
and
learn
from
her
how
faithful
a
woman
could
be
?
  
<EOS>
He
still
be
hold
her
by
the
hand
,
and
he
now
raise
it
to
his
lip
and
kiss
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
offer
from
you

as
high

minded
,
as
generous
,
and
as
honourable
as
its
acceptance
by
me
<EOS>
would
be
mean
-
spirited
,
vile
,
and
ignoble
.
<EOS>

whether
I
fail

whether
I
succeed
,
you
shall
see
me
before
the
winter
be
over

"
   
<EOS>
again
successful
 
Phineas
also
say
a
word
of
farewell
to
Violet
before
he
leave
Matching
,
but
there
be
nothing
peculiar
in
her
little
speech
to
him
,
or
in
his
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
we
shall
see
each
other
in
London
.
<EOS>
do
not
talk
of
not

<EOS>
of

you
will
be

"
<EOS>
then
Phineas
have
shake
his
head
and
smile
.
<EOS>
where
be
he
to
find
a
requisite
number
of
householder
prepare
to
return
him
?
<EOS>
but
as
he
go
up
to
London
he
tell
himself
that
the
air
of
the
House
of
Commons
be
now
the
very
breath
of
his
nostril
.
<EOS>
life
to
him
without
it
would
be
no
life
.
<EOS>
to
have
come
within
the
reach
of
the
good
thing
of
political
life
,
to
have
make
his
mark
so
as
to
have
almost
insure
future
success
,
to
have
be
the
pet
young
official
aspirant
of
the
day
,
 
and
then
to
sink
down
into
the
miserable
platitude
of
private
life
,
to
undergo
daily
attendance
in
law
-
court
without
a
brief
,
to
listen
to
man
who
have
come
to
be
much
below
him
in
estimation
and
social
intercourse
,
to
sit
in
a
wretched
chamber
up
three
pair
of
stair
at
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
whereas
he
be
now
at
this
moment
provide
with
a
gorgeous
apartment
look
out
into
the
Park
from
the
Colonial
Office
in
Downing
Street
,
to
be
attend
by
a
mongrel
between
a
clerk
and
an
errand
boy
at
17
.
<EOS>
6d
.
<EOS>
a
week
instead
of
by
a
private
secretary
who
be
the
son
of
an
earl
's
sister
,
and
be
pet
by
countess
'
daughter
innumerable
,
 
all
this
would
surely
break
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
do
it
,
so
he
tell
himself
,
and
could
have
take
glory
in
do
it
,
have
not
these
other
thing
come
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
but
the
other
thing
have
come
.
<EOS>
He
have
run
the
risk
,
and
have
throw
the
dice
.
<EOS>
and
now
when
the
game
be
so
nearly
win
,
must
it
be
that
everything
should
be
lose
at
last
?
  
<EOS>
He
know
that
nothing
be
to
be
gain
by
melancholy
look
at
his
club
,
or
by
show
of
wretchedness
at
his
office
.
<EOS>
London
be
very
empty
;
but
the
approach
election
still
keep
some
there
who
otherwise
would
have
be
look
after
the
first
flush
of
pheasant
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
be
there
,
and
be
not
long
in
ask
Phineas
what
be
his
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
 
that
be
so
hard
to

<EOS>
Ratler
tell
me

look
about

<EOS>
"
Ratler
be
very
well

Barrington

I

you

not
bring
up

<EOS>
"
oh
no

"
say
Phineas

remember
the
glory
of
Trinity

because
there
would
have
be
an
opening

what

you

Essex
borough

<EOS>
"
broadbury

yes

ready
to
spend

you
like

<EOS>
let
me
see
.
<EOS>
Loughton
be
group
with
Smotherem
,
and
Walker
be
a
deal
too
strong
at
Smotherem
to
hear
of
any
other
claim
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
we
could
dare
to
propose
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
Chelsea
hamlet
,
but
it
will
take
a
wack
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
get
a
wack
of
money
,
"
say
Phineas
,
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
devil
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
if
I
be
you
,
I
should
hark
back
upon
some
place
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
Could
not
you
get
Laurence
to
give
you
up
his
seat
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
Fitzgibbon
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
get
into
office
again
.
<EOS>
nothing
on
earth
would
induce
him
to
look
at
a
paper
during
all
those
week
he
be
at
the
Colonial
Office
;
and
when
Cantrip
speak
to
him
,
all
he
say
be
,
"
ah
,
bother
!
"
<EOS>
Cantrip
do
not
like
it
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
that
would
not
make
him
give
up
his
seat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
would
have
to
arrange
it
.
"
<EOS>
by
which
Phineas
understand
Barrington
Erle
to
mean
that
he
,
Phineas
,
be
in
some
way
to
give
to
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
some
adequate
compensation
for
the
surrender
of
his
position
as
a
county
member
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
that
be
out
of
the
question
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
to
go
,
I
should
not
get
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
have
a
chance
at
Loughshane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
think
of
try
it
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
know
that
Morris
be
very
ill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
Mr.
Morris
be
the
brother
of
Lord
Tulla
,
and
be
the
sit
member
of
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
I
think
I
should
try
that
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
where
we
be
to
put
our
hand
on
a
seat
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
listen
to
this
,
could
not
help
think
that
Barrington
Erle
,
though
he
have
certainly
express
a
great
deal
of
solicitude
,
be
not
as
true
a
friend
as
he
use
to
be
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
,
Phineas
,
have
rise
too
fast
,
and
Barrington
Erle
be
begin
to
think
that
he
may
as
well
be
out
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
He
write
to
his
father
,
ask
after
the
borough
,
and
ask
after
the
health
of
Mr.
Morris
.
<EOS>
and
in
his
letter
he
tell
his
own
story
very
plainly
,
 
almost
pathetically
.
<EOS>
He
perhaps
have
be
wrong
to
make
the
attempt
which
he
have
make
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
believe
that
he
have
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
but
at
any
rate
he
have
make
it
so
far
successfully
,
and
failure
now
would
be
doubly
bitter
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
the
party
to
which
he
belong
must
now
remain
in
office
.
<EOS>
It
would
hardly
be
possible
that
a
new
election
would
produce
a
House
of
Commons
favourable
to
a
conservative
ministry
.
<EOS>
and
with
a
liberal
ministry
he
,
Phineas
,
would
be
sure
of
his
place
,
and
sure
of
an
official
income
,
 
if
only
he
could
find
a
seat
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
true
,
and
be
almost
pathetic
.
<EOS>
the
old
doctor
,
who
be
incline
to
be
proud
of
his
son
,
be
not
unwilling
to
make
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
declare
before
her
daughter
that
if
there
be
a
seat
in
all
Ireland
,
Phineas
ought
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
and
Mary
Flood
Jones
stand
by
listen
,
and
wonder
what
Phineas
would
do
if
he
lose
his
seat
.
<EOS>
Would
he
come
back
and
live
in
County
Clare
,
and
be
like
any
other
girl
's
lover
?
<EOS>
Poor
Mary
have
come
to
lose
her
ambition
,
and
to
think
that
girl
whose
lover
stay
at
home
be
the
happy
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
she
would
have
walk
all
the
way
to
Lord
Tulla
's
house
and
back
again
,
may
that
have
avail
to
get
the
seat
for
Phineas
.
<EOS>
then
there
come
an
express
over
from
Castlemorris
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
want
at
once
to
see
Mr.
Morris
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Morris
be
very
bad
with
gout
in
his
stomach
.
<EOS>
accord
to
the
messenger
it
be
suppose
that
Mr.
Morris
be
die
.
<EOS>
before
Dr.
Finn
have
have
an
opportunity
of
answer
his
son
's
letter
,
Mr.
Morris
,
the
late
member
for
Loughshane
,
have
be
gather
to
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Finn
understand
enough
of
election
for
Parliament
,
and
of
the
nature
of
borough
,
to
be
aware
that
a
candidate
's
chance
of
success
be
very
much
improve
by
be
early
in
the
field
;
and
he
be
aware
,
also
,
that
the
death
of
Mr.
Morris
would
probably
create
various
aspirant
for
the
honour
of
represent
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
hardly
address
the
Earl
on
the
subject
while
the
dead
body
of
the
late
member
be
lie
in
the
house
at
Castlemorris
.
<EOS>
the
bill
which
have
pass
in
the
late
session
for
reform
the
constitution
of
the
House
of
Commons
have
not
touch
Ireland
,
a
future
measure
have
be
promise
to
the
Irish
for
their
comfort
;
and
Loughshane
therefore
be
,
as
to
Lord
Tulla
's
influence
,
the
same
as
it
have
ever
be
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
there
the
plenary
power
which
the
other
lord
have
hold
in
his
hand
in
regard
to
Loughton
;
 
but
still
the
Castlemorris
interest
would
go
a
long
way
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
possible
to
stand
against
it
,
but
it
would
be
much
more
desirable
that
the
candidate
should
have
it
at
his
back
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Finn
be
fully
alive
to
this
as
he
sit
opposite
to
the
old
lord
,
say
now
a
word
about
the
old
lord
's
gout
in
his
leg
and
arm
,
and
then
about
the
gout
in
the
stomach
,
which
have
carry
away
to
another
world

lament

member
for
the

<EOS>
"
no

together

the

could
not
understand
why
such
a
man
as
Lord
Tulla
should
admit
a
liberal
candidate
to
succeed
his
brother

<EOS>
no
one
canvass
for
the
young
Under

with
more
persistent
zeal

do
his

who
,
when

speak

have
produce
so
many
good
argument
against

perilous
step

Lord
Tulla

stand
aloof

desolate
with
grief
at

death

<EOS>
at
such
a
moment
of
family
affliction
,
Lord
Tulla
,
he
declare
,
could
not
think
of
such
a
matter
as
the
borough
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
know
that
Lord
Tulla
be
dreadfully
jealous
of
Mr.
Lambert
St.
George
,
whose
property
in
that
part
of
the
county
be
now
nearly
equal
to
his
own

who
see
much
more
company
at

be
ever
entertain
at

.
<EOS>
a
word
from
Lord
Tulla
,
 
so
say
the
Conservatives
of
the
county
,
 
would
have
put
Mr.
St.

into
the
seat
;
but
that
word
be
not
speak
,

the
Conservatives
of
the
neighbourhood
swear
that
Lord
Tulla
be
a
renegade
.
<EOS>
the
contest
be
very
sharp
,
but
our
hero
be
return
by
a
majority
of
seventeen
vote
.
  
<EOS>
again
successful
!
<EOS>
as
he
think
of
it
he
remember
story
of
great
general
who
be
say
to
have
chain
Fortune
to
the
wheel
of
their
chariot
,
but
it
seem
to
him
that
the
goddess
have
never
serve
any
general
with
such
staunch
obedience
as
she
have
display
in
his
cause
.
<EOS>
have
not
everything
go
well
with
him
;
 
so
well
,
as
almost
to
justify
him
in
expect
that
even
yet
Violet
Effingham
would
become
his
wife
?
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
Violet
!
<EOS>
if
he
could
only
achieve
that
,
no
general
,
who
ever
lead
an
army
across
the
Alps
,
would
be
his
equal
either
in
success
or
in
the
reward
of
success
.
<EOS>
then
he
question
himself
as
to
what
he
would
say
to
Miss
Flood
Jones
on
that
very
night
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
meet
dear
little
Mary
Flood
Jones
that
evening
at
a
neighbour
's
house
.
<EOS>
His
sister
Barbara
have
so
tell
him
in
a
tone
of
voice

he
quite
understand
to
imply
a
caution

make
more
than

evening
come

have
enough
of

He
do
not

there
be

perhaps
there
be
no
position
more
perilous

honesty

that
in

Phineas
now
find

know
himself
to

quite
love

love
himself

good

he
would
have
like

he
would
have
like
to
gratify
her
by
swear
that
she
be
dearer
to
him

all

would
have
like

have
an

at

think

may
be
possible

at
Loughlinter
,
that
he
himself
have
give
a
muttered
assent
and
that
Violet
,
 
as
far
as
he
could
remember
,
 
have
make
no
reply
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
one
of
those
thing
which
be
so
often
mention
,
but
not
settle
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
have
be
strictly
right
in
deny
that
it
have
be
"
settle
"
in
his
presence
;
 
but
yet
he
feel
that
he
have
be
wrong
in
contradict
his
wife
so
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
just
man
,
and
he
would
apologise
for
his
fault
;
but
he
be
an
austere
man
,
and
would
take
back
the
value
of
his
apology
in
additional
austerity
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
see
his
wife
for
some
hour
after
the
conversation
which
have
be
narrate
,
but
when
he
do
meet
her
his
mind
be
still
full
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
Laura
"
,
he
say
,
"
I
be
sorry
that
I
contradict
you

"
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
then
he
pause
a
moment
,
but
she
say
not
a
word
,
 
only
smile
and
bow
her
head
again
.
<EOS>
"
I

,
"
that
something

my
presence
to
Miss
Effingham

so

it

have
much
to
do
with

not
these
two
young
people
meet

behave
extremely
well

<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
say
nothing
further
at
the
time
,
and
it
become
an
understanding
that
Violet
Effingham
be
to
be
a
month
at
Loughlinter
,
stay
from
the
20th
of
December
to
the
20th
of
January
,
and
that
Lord
Chiltern
be
to
come
there
for
Christmas
,
 
which
with
him
would
probably
mean
three
day
.
  
<EOS>
before
Christmas
come
,
however
,
there
be
various
other
source
of
uneasiness
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
great
anxiety
as
to
the
election
.
<EOS>
with
Lady
Laura
this
anxiety
have
be
very
strong
,
and
even
Mr.
Kennedy
have
be
warm
with
some
amount
of
fire
as
the
announcement
reach
him
of
the
success
and
of
the
failure
.
<EOS>
the
english
return
come
first
,
 
and
then
the
Scotch
,
which
be
quite
as
interesting
to
Mr.
Kennedy
as
the
English
.
<EOS>
His
own
seat
be
quite
safe
,
 
be
not
contest
;
but
some
neighbouring
seat
be
source
of
great
solicitude
.
<EOS>
then
,
when
this
be
over
,
there
be
the
tiding
from
Ireland
to
be
receive
;
and
respect
one
special
borough
in
Ireland
,
Lady
Laura
evince
more
solicitude
than
her
husband
approve
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
danger
for
the
domestic
bliss
of
the
house
of
Loughlinter
,
when
thing
come
to
such
a
pass
,
and
such
word
be
speak
,
as
the
election
at
Loughshane
produce
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
in
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
open
a
telegram
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
in
?
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
,
with
that
frown
on
his
brow
to
which
his
wife
be
now
well
accustomed
.
<EOS>
though
he
ask
the
question
,
he
know
very
well
who
be
the
hero
to
whom
the
telegram
refer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
Phineas
Finn

"
say
Lady
Laura
,
speak
still
with
an
excited
voice
,
 
with
a
voice
that
be
intend
to
display
excitement
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
to
be
a
battle
on
this
matter
,
there
should
be
a
battle
.
<EOS>
She
would
display
all
her
anxiety
for
her
young
friend
,
and
fle
it
in
her
husband
's
face
if
he
choose
to
take
it
as
an
injury
.
<EOS>
what
,
 
should
she
endure
reproach
from
her
husband
because
she
regard
the
interest
of
the
man
who
have
save
his
life
,
of
the
man
respect
whom
she
have
suffer
so
many
heart
-
struggle
,
and
as
to
whom
she
have
at
last
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
should
ever
be
regard
as
a
second
brother
,
love
equally
with
the
eld
brother
?
<EOS>
She
have
do
her
duty
by
her
husband
,
 
so
at
least
she
have
assure
herself
;
 
and
should
he
dare
to
reproach
her
on
this
subject
,
she
would
be
ready
for
the
battle
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
battle
come
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
this
,
"
she
say
,
with
all
the
eagerness
she
could
throw
into
her
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
,
indeed
,
 
and
so
ought
you
to
be
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
husband
's
brow
grow
blacker
and
blacker
,
but
still
he
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
have
long
be
too
proud
to
be
jealous
,
and
be
now
too
proud
to
express
his
jealousy
,
 
if
only
he
could
keep
the
expression
back
.
<EOS>
but
his
wife
would
not
leave
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
thankful
for
this
,
"
she
say
,
press
the
telegram
between
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
afraid

would
fail

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
over
-
do
your
anxiety
on
such
a
subject

"
at
last
he
say
,
speak
very
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you

how

if

to
him
it

almost
so

I
would
have
walk
from

to
London

get
him

and
as
she
speak
she
hold
up
the
clenched
fist
of
her
left
hand
,
and
shake
it
,
while
she
still

you
will
cease

extravagantly

I

no
further

<EOS>

I
have
hold
no
communication

say
Lady
Laura

advance
a
step
towards
him

<EOS>
but
Mr.
Kennedy
simply
point
to
the
telegram
in
her
hand
,
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
now
in
respect
to
this
telegram
there
have
be
an
unfortunate
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
prepared
to
say
that
there
be
any
reason
why
Phineas
himself
should
not
have
send
the
news
of
his
success
to
Lady
Laura

but
he
have
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
piece
of
paper
which
she
still
hold
crush
in
her
hand
be
in
itself
very
innocent

Hurrah

Finny
have
do
the
trick

<EOS>
such
be
the
word
write
on

slip

they
have
be
send
to
Lady
Laura
by
her
young
cousin

the
clerk
in
the
office
who
act
as
private
secretary
to
the
Under

Secretary
of
State

<EOS>
Lady
Laura
resolve
that
her

never
see
those
innocent

rather
undignified
word

<EOS>
the
occasion
have
become
one
of
importance

such
word
be
unworthy
of
it

<EOS>
besides
,
she
would
not
condescend
to
defend
herself
by
bring
forward
a
telegram
as
evidence
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
so
she
burn
the
morsel
of
paper

<EOS>
Lady

again
till
late

evening

ill

after
dinner

him
a
note

when
the

have
read

he
smile

thank
the
girl
who
have
bring
it

well

no

withdraw
the
accusation

I
will
write
to
both
my
father
and
my
brother
,
and
desire
them
to
take
me
from
your
house
.
<EOS>
if
you
wish
me
to
remain
here
,
you
have
better
be
careful
!
"
<EOS>
as
she
be
make
this
speech
,
her
temper
seem
to
rise
,
and
to
become
hot
,
and
then
hot
,
till
it
glow
with
a
red
heat
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
cool
till
the
word
insult
,
use
by
herself
,
have
convey
back
to
her
a
strong
impression
of
her
own
wrong
,
 
or
<EOS>
perhaps
I
should
rather
say
a
strong
feeling
of
the
necessity
of
become
indignant
.
<EOS>
She
be
stand
as
she
speak
,
and
the
fire
flash
from
her
eye
,
and
he
quail
before
her
.
<EOS>
the
threat
which
she
have
hold
out
to
him
be
very
dreadful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
terribly
in
fear
of
the
world
's
good
opinion
,
who
lack
the
courage
to
go
through
a
great
and
harass
trial
in
order
that
something
well
may
come
afterwards
.
<EOS>
His
married
life
have
be
unhappy
.
<EOS>
His
wife
have
not
submit
either
to
his
will
or
to
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
have
that
great
desire
to
enjoy
his
full
right
,
so
strong
in
the
mind
of
weak
,
ambitious
man
,
and
he
have
tell
himself
that
a
wife
's
obedience
be
one
of
those
right
which
he
could
not
abandon
without
injury
to
his
self
-
esteem
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
about
the
matter
,
slowly
,
as
be
his
will
not
,
and
have
resolve
that
he
would
assert
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
assert
himself
,
and
his
wife
tell
him
to
his
face
that
she
would
go
away
and
leave
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
detain
her
legally
,
but
he
could
not
do
even
that
without
the
fact
of
such
forcible
detention
be
know
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
answer
her
now
at
this
moment
,
so
that
she
may
not
write
to
her
father
,
and
so
that
his
self
-
assertion
may
still
be
maintain
?
  
<EOS>
"
passion
,
Laura
,
can
never
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
you
have
a
woman
submit
to
insult
without
passion
?
<EOS>
I
at
any
rate
be
not
such
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
then
there
be
a
pause
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
nothing
else
to
say
to
me
,
you
have
better
leave
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
far
from
well
,
and
my
head
be
throb
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
come
up
and
take
her
hand
,
but
she
snatch
it
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
Laura
,
"
he
say
,
"
do
not
let
us
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
shall
quarrel
if
such
insinuation
be
repeat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
make
no
insinuation
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
repeat
them
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
cow
and
leave
her
,
have
first
attempt
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
of
his
position
by
make
much
of
her
alleged
illness
,
and
by
offer
to
send
for
Dr.
Macnuthrie
.
<EOS>
She
positively
refuse
to
see
Dr.
Macnuthrie
,
and
at
last
succeed
in
induce
him
to
quit
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
this
have
occur
about
the
end
of
November
,
and
on
the
20th
of
December
Violet
Effingham
reach
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
life
in
Mr.
Kennedy
's
house
have
go
quietly
during
the
intervene
three
week
,
but
not
very
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
Phineas
Finn
have
not
be
mention
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
triumph
;
but
she
have
no
desire
to
acerbate
her
husband
by
any
unpalatable
allusion
to
her
victory
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
quite
willing
to
let
the
subject
die
away
,
if
only
it
would
die
.
<EOS>
on
some
other
matter
he
continue
to
assert
himself
,
take
his
wife
to
church
twice
every
Sunday
,
use
long
family
prayer
than
she
approve
,
read
an
additional
sermon
himself
every
Sunday
evening
,
call
upon
her
for
weekly
attention
to
elaborate
household
account
,
ask
for
her
personal
assistance
in
much
local
visiting
,
initiate
her
into
his
favourite
method
of
family
life
in
the
country
,
till
sometimes
she
almost
long
to
talk
again
about
Phineas
Finn
,
so
that
there
may
be
a
rupture
,
and
she
may
escape
.
<EOS>
but
her
husband
assert
himself
within
bound
,
and
she
submit
,
longing
for
the
coming
of
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
write
to
her
father
and
beg
to
be
take
away
,
because
her
husband
would
read
a
sermon
to
her
on
Sunday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
to
Violet
,
very
shortly
after
her
arrival
,
she
tell
her
whole
story
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
terrible
,
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
make
me
feel
that
I
never
will
be
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
yet
what
can
a
woman
become
if
she
remain
single
?
<EOS>
the
curse
be
to
be
a
woman
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
feel
so
proud
of
the
privilege
of
my
sex
,
"
say
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
have
find
them
,
"
say
the
other
;
"
never
.
<EOS>
I
have
try
to
make
the
good
of
its
weakness
,
and
this
be
what
I
have
come
to
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
ought
to
have
love
some
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
never
love
any
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
do
,
 
not
as
people
mean
when
they
speak
of
love
.
<EOS>
I
have
feel
that
I
would
consent
to
be
cut
in
little
piece
for
my
brother
,
 
because
of
my
regard
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
that
be
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
have
feel
something
of
the
same
thing
for
another
,
 
a
longing
for
his
welfare
,
a
delight
to
hear
him
praise
,
a
charm
in
his
presence
,
 
so
strong
a
feeling
for
his
interest
<EOS>
,
that
be
he
to
go
to
wrack
and
ruin
,
<EOS>
I
too
,
should
,
after
a
fashion
,
be
wrack
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
but
it
have
not
be
love
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
know
whom
you
mean
?
<EOS>
May
I
name
him
?
<EOS>
It
be
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
be
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
he
ever
ask
you
,
 
to
love
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
he
would
do
so
,
and
therefore
accept
Mr.
Kennedy
's
offer
almost
at
the
first
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
quite
understand
your
reasoning
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
refuse
him
nothing
in
my
power
to
give
him
,
but
I
do
not
wish
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
never
ask
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
pause
a
moment
,
think
what
reply
she
should
make
;
 
and
then
she
tell
a
fib
.
"
<EOS>
no
;
he
never
ask
me
.
"
<EOS>
but
Violet
do
not
believe
the
fib
.
<EOS>
Violet
be
quite
sure
that
Phineas
have
ask
Lady
Laura
Standish
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
"
say
Violet
,
"
Madame
Max
Goesler
be
his
present
passion

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
it
in
the

say
Lady
Laura
,
fire
up

<EOS>
"
It
do
not
much
matter

"
say
Violet

<EOS>
"
It
would
matter
very
much
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
you
,
 
you
;
you
know
whom
he
love

I
do
believe
that
sooner

later
you
will
be
his
wife

<EOS>
"
never

"
  
"
yes
,
you
will

<EOS>
have
you
not

him
you
would
never
have
condescend
to
accuse
him
about
that
woman

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
accuse
him
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
not
marry
Madame
Max
Goesler
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
just
the
thing
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
never
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
,
you
be
the
most
capricious
of
woman
.
<EOS>
You
have
two
dear
friend
,
and
you
insist
that
I
shall
marry
them
both
.
<EOS>
which
shall
I
take
first
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
will
be
here
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
you
can
take
him
if
you
like
it
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
will
ask
you
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
think
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
do
not
think
I
shall
.
<EOS>
I
shall
knock
under
to
Mr.
Mill
,
and
go
in
for
woman
's
right
,
and
look
forward
to
stand
for
some
female
borough
.
<EOS>
Matrimony
never
seem
to
me
to
be
very
charming
,
and
upon
my
word
it
do
not
become
more
alluring
by
what
I
find
at
Loughlinter
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
Violet
and
Lady
Laura
discuss
these
matter
together
,
but
Violet
have
never
show
to
her
friend
the
card
in
her
hand
,
as
Lady
Laura
have
show
those
which
she
hold
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
in
fact
tell
almost
everything
that
there
be
to
tell
,
 
have
speak
either
plainly
with
true
word
,
or
equally
plainly
with
word
that
be
not
true
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
have
almost
come
to
love
Phineas
Finn
;
 
<EOS>
but
she
never
tell
her
friend
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
she
have
almost
make
up
her
mind
to
give
herself
and
all
her
wealth
to
this
adventurer
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
well
man
,
she
think
,
than
Lord
Chiltern
;
and
she
have
come
to
persuade
herself
that
it
be
almost
imperative
on
her
to
take
the
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
though
she
could
talk
about
remain
unmarried
,
she
know
that
that
be
practically
impossible
.
<EOS>
all
those
around
her
,
 
those
of
the
Baldock
as
well
as
those
of
the
Brentford
faction
,
 
would
make
such
a
life
impossible
to
her
.
<EOS>
besides
,
in
such
a
case
what
could
she
do
?
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
to
talk
of
disregard
the
world
and
of
set
up
a
house
for
herself
;
 
but
she
be
quite
aware
that
that
project
could
not
be
use
further
than
for
the
purpose
of
scare
her
amiable
aunt
.
<EOS>
and
if
not
that
,
 
then
could
she
content
herself
to
look
forward
to
a
joint
life
with
Lady
Baldock
and
Augusta
Boreham
?
<EOS>
She
may
,
of
course
,
oblige
her
aunt
by
take
Lord
Fawn
,
or
oblige
her
aunt
equally
by
take
Mr.
Appledom
;
but
she
be
strongly
of
opinion
that
either
Lord
Chiltern
or
Phineas
would
be
preferable
to
these
.
<EOS>
think
over
it
always
she
have
come
to
feel
that
it
must
be
either
Lord
Chiltern
or
Phineas
;
but
she
have
never
whisper
her
thought
to
man
or
woman
.
<EOS>
on
her
journey
to
Loughlinter
,
where
she
then
know
that
she
be
to
meet
Lord
Chiltern
,
she
endeavour
to
persuade
herself
that
it
should
be
Phineas
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Laura
have
mar
it
all
by
that
ill
-
tell
fib
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
moment
before
in
which
Violet
have
feel
that
Phineas
have
sacrifice
something
of
that
truth
of
love
for
which
she
give
him
credit
to
the
glance
of
Madame
Goesler
's
eye
;
but
she
have
rebuke
herself
for
the
idea
,
accuse
herself
not
only
of
a
little
jealousy
,
but
of
foolish
vanity
.
<EOS>
be
he
,
whom
she
have
reject
,
not
to
speak
to
another
woman
?
<EOS>
then
come
the
blow
from
Lady
Laura
,
and
Violet
know
that
it
be
a
blow
.
<EOS>
this
gallant
lover
,
this
young
Crichton
,
this
unassuming
but
ardent
lover
,
have
simply
take
up
with
her
as
soon
as
he
have
fail
with
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
have
be
most
enthusiastic
in
her
expression
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
such
platonic
regard
may
be
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
It
be
for
Mr.
Kennedy
to
look
to
that
.
<EOS>
but
,
for
herself
,
she
feel
that
such
expression
be
hardly
compatible
with
her
idea
of
have
her
lover
all
to
herself
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
again
remember
Madame
Goesler
's
bright
blue
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
come
on
Christmas
eve
,
and
be
receive
with
open
arm
by
his
sister
,
and
with
that
painful
,
irritate
affection
which
such
a
girl
as
Violet
can
show
to
such
a
man
as
Lord
Chiltern
,
when
she
will
not
give
him
that
other
affection
for
which
his
heart
be
pant
.
<EOS>
the
two
man
be
civil
to
each
other
,
 
but
very
cold
.
<EOS>
They
call
each
other
Kennedy
and
Chiltern
,
but
even
that
be
not
do
without
an
effort
.
<EOS>
on
the
Christmas
morning
Mr.
Kennedy
ask
his
brother
-
in
-
law
to
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
kind
of
thing
I
never
do
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
give
a
little
start
,
and
look
a
look
of
horror
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
show
that
she
be
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
turn
away
her
face
,
and
smile
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
walk
across
the
park
Violet
take
Lord
Chiltern
's
part
.
"
<EOS>
He
only
mean
that
he
do
not
go
to
church
on
Christmas
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
he
mean
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
need
not
speak
of
it
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
not
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
to
church
with
him
on
Sundays
myself
,
"
say
Violet
,
perhaps
not
reflect
that
the
practice
of
early
year
have
little
to
do
with
the
young
man
's
life
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
Christmas
day
and
the
next
day
pass
without
any
sign
from
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
on
the
day
after
that
he
be
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
to
leave
till
one
or
two
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
have
be
say
between
the
two
woman
,
since
he
have
be
in
the
house
,
on
the
subject
of
which
both
of
them
be
think
.
<EOS>
very
much
have
be
say
of
the
expediency
of
his
go
to
Saulsby
,
but
on
this
matter
he
have
decline
to
make
any
promise
.
<EOS>
sit
in
Lady
Laura
's
room
,
in
the
presence
of
both
of
them
,
he
have
refuse
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
bad
to
drive
,
"
he
say
,
turn
to
Violet
,
"
and
you
have
well
not
try
to
drive
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
not
you
be
drive
as
well
as
another
?

<EOS>
she
answer
,
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
the
First
Blow
 
Lord
Chiltern
,
though
he
have
pass
two
entire
day
in
the
house
with
Violet
without
renew
his
suit
,
have
come
to
Loughlinter
for
the
express
purpose
of
do
so
,
and
have
his
plan
perfectly
fix
in
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
on
that
last
morning
he
be
up
-
stair
with
his
sister
in
her
own
room
,
and
immediately
make
his
request
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Laura
,
"
he
say
,
"
go
down
like
a
good
girl
,
and
make
Violet
come
up
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
stand
a
moment
look
at
him
and
smile
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
mind
,
"
he
continue
,
"
you
be
not
to
come
back
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
Violet
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
suppose
Violet
will
not
come
?
<EOS>
young
lady
do
not
generally
wait
upon
young
man
on
such
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
but
I
rank
her
so
high
among
young
woman
,
that
I
think
she
will
have
common
sense
enough
to
teach
her
that
,
after
what
have
pass
between
us
,
I
have
a
right
to
ask
for
an
interview
,
and
that
it
may
be
more
conveniently
have
here
than
in
the
wilderness
of
the
house
below
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
whatever
may
have
be
the
argument
use
by
her
friend
,
Violet
do
come
.
<EOS>
She
reach
the
door
all
alone
,
and
open
it
bravely
.
<EOS>
She
have
promise
herself
,
as
she
come
along
the
passage
,
that
she
would
not
pause
with
her
hand
on
the
lock
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
have
first
go
to
her
own
room
,
and
as
she
leave
it
<EOS>
she
have
look
into
the
glass
with
a
hurried
glance
,
and
have
then
rest
for
a
moment
,
 
think
that
something
should
be
do
,
that
her
hair
may
be
smooth
,
or
a
ribbon
set
straight
,
or
the
chain
arrange
under
her
brooch
.
<EOS>
a
girl
would
wish
to
look
well
before
her
lover
,
even
when
she
mean
to
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
but
her
pause
be
but
for
an
instant
,
and
then
she
go
on
,
have
touch
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
and
press
her
hand
together
,
and
go
on
quick
and
open
the
door
,
 
almost
with
a
little
start
.
<EOS>
"
violet
,
this
be
very
good
of
you
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
,
stand
with
his
back
to
the
fire

not
move
from
the
spot

<EOS>
"
Laura
have
tell
me

do
it

<EOS>

I
must
have
be
bad
at

too

I

make
you

I

I

spoken

not
talk
,
be
not
muddle

pated

<EOS>
I
have
understand
.
<EOS>
but
while
you
be
single
there
must
be
yet
hope
;

,
indeed
,
you
will
tell
me
that
you
have
already
give
yourself
to
another
man

not

how
can
I
not

Violet

I
would
if
I
could
tell
you
all
my
feeling
plainly

once

twice

thrice
,
I
have
say
to
myself
that
I
would
think
of
you
no

I
have
try

persuade
myself
that
I
be
better
single
than
married

<EOS>
"
but
I
be
not
the
only

to

Oswald

what
do
you
mean

"
  
<EOS>

I

go

some
distant
part

world

where
I
may
be
kill

live
a
life
of
adventure

I
shall
do
so
simply
in
despair

It
will
not

great
should

letter

by
heaven

you
shall

<EOS>
He
have
drop
her
hand
when
she
call
him
violent
;

now
he
take
them
again
,
and
still
she
permit
it
.

I
have
postpone
it
only

speak

no

will
you
love

She
pause
and
look
down
,
have
even
now
not
withdraw
her
hand
from
him

I
do
not

he
know
how
much
he
have
gain
.

use
to
love
me

a
little
,

changed

She
do
not
answer
him
,

he
stand
for
a
moment
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
then
he
rush
at
her
,
and
,
seize
her
in
his
arm
,
kiss
her
all
over
,
 
her
forehead
,
her
lip
,
her
cheek
,
then
both
her
hand
,
and
then
her
lip
again
.
"
<EOS>
by
G
 
,
she
be
my
own
!

<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
then
he
go
back
to
the
rug
before
the
fire
,
and
stand
there
with
his
back
turn
to
her
.
<EOS>
Violet
,
when
she
find
herself
thus
desert
,
retreat
to
a
sofa
,
and
sit
herself
down
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
negative
to
produce
now
in
answer
to
the
violent
assertion
which
he
have
pronounce
as
to
his
own
success
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
.
<EOS>
She
have
doubt
,
and
doubt
,
 
and
still
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
now
she
must
doubt
no
longer
.
<EOS>
of
one
thing
she
be
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
She
could
love
him
.
<EOS>
as
thing
have
now
go
,
she
would
make
him
quite
happy
with
assurance
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
as
to
that
other
question
,
 
that
fearful
question
,
whether
or
not
she
could
trust
him
,
 
on
that
matter
she
have
well
at
present
say
nothing
,
and
think
as
little
,
perhaps
,
as
may
be
.
<EOS>
She
have
take
the
jump
,
and
therefore
why
should
she
not
be
gracious
to
him
?
<EOS>
but
how
be
she
to
be
gracious
to
a
lover
who
stand
there
with
his
back
turn
to
her
?
  
<EOS>
after
the
interval
of
a
minute
or
two
he
remember
himself
,
and
turn
round
.
<EOS>
see
her
seat
,
he
approach
her
,
and
go
down
on
both
knee
close
at
her
foot
.
<EOS>
then
he
take
her
hand
again
,
for
the
third
time
,
and
look
up
into
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
,
you
on
your
knee
!
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
bend
to
a
princess
,
"
he
say
,
"
to
ask
for
half
her
throne
;
but
I
will
kneel
here
all
day
,
if
you
will
let
me
,
in
thank
for
the
gift
of
your
love

<EOS>
I
never

to
beg
for
it

<EOS>
"
this
be
the
man
who
can
not
make
speech

"
  
<EOS>

I

I
could
talk
now
by
the
hour
,
with
you
for
a
listener

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,

I
must
talk
too

<EOS>
"
what
will
you
say
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
while
you
be
kneel
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
natural
that
you
should
kneel
.
<EOS>
You
be
like
Samson
with
his
lock
shorn
,
or
hercule
with
a
distaff
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
well
?

he
say
,
as
he
get
up
and
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
in
earnest

"
<EOS>
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
in

<EOS>
I
hardly
think
that
that
would
be
doubt

you
not

<EOS>
"
I
do

you
will
be
good

<EOS>
"

<EOS>

I
will
say
it
fifty
time
,
 
till
your
ear
be
weary
with
it

;
 
and
she
do
say
it
to
him
,
after
her
own
fashion
,
fifty
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
great
change
,
"
he
say
,
get
up
after
a
while
and
walk
about
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
a
change
for
the
well
;
 
be
it
not
,
Oswald
?
"
  
"
so
much
for
the
well
that
I
hardly
know
myself
in
my
new
joy

<EOS>
but
,
Violet
,
we
will
have
no
delay
,
 
will
we
?
<EOS>
no
shilly
-
shallye
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
wait
now
that
it
be
settle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
none
in
the
least

Lord
Chiltern

<EOS>
let
us
say

this
day
twelvemonth

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
laugh
at
me
,
Violet

<EOS>
"
  
"
remember
,
sir
,
that
the
first
thing
you
have
to
do
be
to
write
to
your
father

<EOS>
He
instantly
go
to
the
writing
-
table
and
take
up
paper
and
pen
.

"
come
along
,
"
he
say

<EOS>
"
You
be
to
dictate
it

<EOS>
but
this
she
refuse
to
do
,
tell
him
that
he
must
write
his
letter
to
his
father
out
of
his
own
head
,
and
out
of
his
own
heart

<EOS>
"
I
can
not
write
it

he
say
,
throw
down
the
pen

<EOS>
"
My
blood
be
in
such
a
tumult
that
I
can
not
steady
my
hand

<EOS>
"
You
must
not
be
so
tumultuous

Oswald

I
shall
have
to
live
in
a
whirlwind

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
shall
shake
down
.
<EOS>
I
shall
become
as
steady
as
an
old
stager

I
will
go
as
quiet
in
harness
by
-
and
-
by
as
though
I
have
be
break
to
it
a
four
-
year

old

<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Laura
could
not
write
this
letter
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
should
write
it
yourself

<EOS>
"
if
you
bid
me
I
will
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

bid
you

you

in

new
trouble
you
be

you
will

in
everything

that
I
shall
be
bind

do
your
bidding

do
it
not

to
be
dreadful

My
wonder
be
that
any
girl

ever
accept
any
man

you
have
accept
me

you

no

you
,
Oswald

I
will
not

no

He

and
then
he
promise
that
there
should

a
party

up
at
Saulsby
before
the
winter
be

<EOS>
His

and
write

thence
.
"
<EOS>
Your

perhaps
,
will
not
be
so
tumultuous
at
Carlisle
,
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
and
go
on
with
his
plan
.
<EOS>
He
would
then
go
on
to
London
and
down
to
Willingford
,
and
there
wait
for
his
father
's
answer
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
reason
why
I
should
lose
more
of
the
hunting
than
necessary
.
"
<EOS>
"
pray
do
not
lose
a
day
for
me
,
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
hear
from

<EOS>
"
You

from
the
beginning

when
I

I
have
know

and
I
could
have
live
without

<EOS>
"
Poor
Phineas

for
instance

We
will
mention

<EOS>
Mr.

perhaps

more
likely

He
have
be
my
most
constant
lover

then
he
would
be
so
safe

<EOS>
Your

dangerous

<EOS>
He
be
like
the
bad

<EOS>
He
have
have
a
pole
stick
upon
him
ever
since
he

a
boy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

give
a

"
  
<EOS>
"
remember
that
I
do
not

him
a
bit
the

the
well

a
sense

danger
do
not

evil
may
be
fatal

<EOS>
I
have
enter
myself
for
my
forlorn
hope

I

to
stick
to
it

<EOS>
now
I
must
go
and

only
think

I

nothing

about
Miss
Effingham
's
first
love

letter

which
be
,
no

,
creditable
to

heart
;
but
there
be
two
other
letter
send

post
from

which
shall

Lady

her
friend
Phineas
Finn

and
the
other
from
Violet
to
her
aunt
,
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
no
letter
be
write
to
Lord
Brentford
,
as
it
be
think
desirable
that
he
should
receive
the
first
intimation
of
what
have
be
do
from
his
son

<EOS>
respect
the
letter
to
Phineas
,
which
shall
be
first
give
,
Lady
Laura
think
it
right
to
say
a
word
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
of
course
tell
of
the
engagement
,
and
have
reply
that
he
could
have
wish
that
the
arrangement
could
have
be
make
elsewhere
than
at
his
house
,
know
as
he
do
that
Lady
Baldock
would
not
approve
of
it
.
<EOS>
to
this
Lady
Laura
have
make
no
reply
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
have
condescend
to
congratulate
the
bride
-
elect
.
<EOS>
when
Lady
Laura
's
letter
to
Phineas
be
complete
she
take
care
to
put
it
into
the
letter
-
box
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
write
to
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
say
,
"
to
tell
him
of
this
marriage

<EOS>
"
why
be
it
necessary
that
he
should
be
tell
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
due
to
him
,
 
from
certain
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
there
be
any
truth
in
what
everybody
be
say
about
their
fighting
a
duel
?
"
ask
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
His
wife
make
no
answer
,
and
then
he
continue
 
<EOS>
"
You
tell
me
of
your
own
knowledge
that
it
be
untrue

<EOS>
"
  
"
not
of
my
own
knowledge

Robert

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
of

then
Mr.
Kennedy
walk
away

be
certain
that
his

have
deceive
him
about
the
duel

<EOS>
there
have
be
a
duel
,
and
she
have
know
it
;
and
yet
she
have
tell
him
that
the
report
be
a
ridiculous
fabrication
.
<EOS>
He
never
forget
anything
.
<EOS>
He
remember
at
this
moment
the
word
of
the
falsehood
,
and
the
look
of
her
face
as
she
tell
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
believe
her
implicitly
,
but
he
would
never
believe
her
again
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
man
who
,
in
spite
of
their
experience
of
the
world
,
of
their
experience
of
their
own
life
,
imagine
that
lip
that

never

<EOS>
my
dear

Violet
Effingham
be
here
,
and
Oswald
have
just
leave
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
possible
that
you
may
see
him
as
he
pass
through
London
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
any
rate
,
I
think
it
best
to
let
you
know
immediately
that
she
have
accept
him
,
 
at
last
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
pang
in
this
to
you
,
be
sure
that
I
will
grieve
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
wish

I

which
be
the

<EOS>
lately

tear

way

<EOS>
You
will
understand
what
I
mean
,
and
I
believe
I
need
say
nothing
more
;
 
except
this
,
that
it
shall
be
among
my
prayer
that
you
may
obtain
all
thing
that
may
tend
to
make
you
happy
,
honourable
,
and
of
high
esteem
.
  
<EOS>
Your
most
sincere
friend
  
LAURA
KENNEDY
.
  
<EOS>
even
though
her
husband
should
read
the
letter
,
there
be
nothing
in
that
of
which
she
nee
be
ashamed
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
simply
speculate
as
to
its
content
,
and
inquire
within
himself
whether
it
would
not
be
for
the
welfare
of
the
world
in
general
,
and
for
the
welfare
of
himself
in
particular
,
that
husband
should
demand
to
read
their
wife
'
letter
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
be
Violet
's
letter
to
her
aunt

my

<EOS>
the
thing
have
come

<EOS>
at

myself
off
your

.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
have
just

here
,
and
I
have
accept
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
you
hardly
think
so
well
of
Lord
Chiltern
as
I
do
;
but
then
,
perhaps
,
you
have
not
know
him
so
long
.
<EOS>
You
do
know
,
however
,
that
there
have
be
some
difference
between
him
and
his
father
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
may
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
now
,
upon
his
engagement
,
this
will
be
settle
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
inexpressible
pleasure
of
feel
sure
that
Lord
Brentford
will
welcome
me

his

of
his
old
bedroom

Killaloe
,
of
his
little
garret
at
Trinity
,
of
the
dingy
chamber
in
Lincoln
's
Inn

he
would
tell
himself
that
it

very
gorgeous

<EOS>
He

It

and
then
discuss
with
his
principal
,
Lord
Cantrip

the
expediency
of
advise
the
Government
to
lend
a
company
five
million
of
money

down
by
his
side
very
gently
,
go
back
to
his
map
as
though
the
thing
would
not
so
trouble
his
mind
as
to
disturb
his
work
.
<EOS>
He
absolutely
write
,
automatically
,
certain
word
of
a
note
about
the
harbour
,
after
he
have
receive
the
information
.
<EOS>
a
horse
will
gallop
for
some
score
of
yard
,
after
his
back
have
be
break
,
before
he
know
of
his
great
ruin
;
 
and
so
it
be
with
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
His
back
be
break
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
gallop
,
for
a
yard
or
two
.
"
<EOS>
close
in
1860
-
61
for
thirteen
day
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
begin
to
be
aware
that
his
back
be
break
,
and
that
the
writing
of
any
more
note
about
the
ice
in
Halifax
harbour
be
for
the
present
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
best
to
let
you
know
immediately
that
she
have
accept
him
.
<EOS>
"
these
be
the
word
which
he
read
the
oftenest
.
<EOS>
then
it
be
all
over
!
<EOS>
the
game
be
play
out
,
and
all
his
victory
be
as
nothing
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
sit
for
an
hour
in
his
gorgeous
room
think
of
it
,
and
various
be
the
answer
which
he
give
during
the
time
to
various
message
;
 
but
he
would
see
nobody
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
colony
,
he
do
not
care
if
they
revolt
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
part
with
every
colony
belong
to
Great
Britain
to
have
get
the
hand
of
Violet
Effingham
for
himself
.
<EOS>
now
,
 
now
at
this
moment
,
he
tell
himself
with
oath
that
he
have
never
love
any
one
but
Violet
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
so
much
to
make
such
a
marriage
desirable
!
<EOS>
I
should
wrong
my
hero
<EOS>
deeply
be
I
to
say
that
the
weight
of
his
sorrow
be
occasion
by
the
fact
that
he
have
lose
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
He
would
never
have
think
of
look
for
Violet
Effingham
<EOS>
have
he
not
first
learn
to
love
her
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
idea
open
itself
out
to
him
,
everything
have
seem
to
be
so
suitable
.
<EOS>
have
Miss
Effingham
become
his
wife
,
the
mouth
of
the
Lows
and
of
the
bunce
would
have
be
stop
altogether
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
would
have
come
to
his
house
as
his
familiar
guest
,
and
he
would
have
be
connect
with
half
a
score
of
peer
.
<EOS>
a
seat
in
Parliament
would
be
simply
his
proper
place
,
and
even
Under
-
Secretaryships
of
State
may
soon
come
to
be
below
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
play
a
great
game
,
but
hitherto
he
have
play
it
with
so
much
success
,
 
with
such
wonderful
luck
!
<EOS>
that
it
have
seem
to
him
that
all
thing
be
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
nothing
more
have
be
want
to
him
than
Violet
's
hand
for
his
own
comfort
,
and
Violet
's
fortune
to
support
his
position
;
and
these
,
too
,
have
almost
seem
to
be
within
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
His
goddess
have
indeed
refuse
him
,
 
but
not
with
disdain
.
<EOS>
even
Lady
Laura
have
talk
of
his
marriage
as
not
improbable
.
<EOS>
all
the
world
,
almost
,
have
hear
of
the
duel
;
and
all
the
world
have
smile
,
and
seem
to
think
that
in
the
real
fight
Phineas
Finn
would
be
the
victor
,
 
that
the
lucky
pistol
be
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
It
have
never
occur
to
any
one
to
suppose
,
 
as
far
as
he
could
see
,
 
that
he
be
presume
at
all
,
or
push
himself
out
of
his
own
sphere
,
in
ask
Violet
Effingham
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
no
;
 
he
would
trust
his
luck
,
would
persevere
,
and
would
succeed
.
<EOS>
such
have
be
his
resolution
on
that
very
morning
,
 
and
now
there
have
come
this
letter
to
dash
him
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
moment
in
which
he
declare
to
himself
that
he
would
not
believe
the
letter
,
 
not
that
there
be
any
moment
in
which
there
be
in
his
mind
the
slight
spark
of
real
hope
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
tell
himself
that
he
would
still
persevere
.
<EOS>
Violet
may
have
be
drive
to
accept
that
violent
man
by
violent
influence
,
 
or
it
may
be
that
she
have
not
in
truth
accept
him
,
that
Chiltern
have
simply
so
assert
.
<EOS>
or
,
even
if
it
be
so
,
do
woman
never
change
their
mind
?
<EOS>
the
manly
thing
would
be
to
persevere
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
have
he
not
before
be
successful
,
when
success
seem
to
be
as
far
from
him
?
<EOS>
but
he
could
buoy
himself
up
with
no
real
hope
.
<EOS>
even
when
these
idea
be
present
to
his
mind
,
he
know
,
 
he
know
well
,
 
at
those
very
moment
,
that
his
back
be
break
.
  
<EOS>
some
one
have
come
in
and
light
the
candle
and
draw
down
the
blind
while
he
be
sit
there
,
and
now
,
as
he
look
at
his
watch
,
he
find
that
it
be
past
five
o'clock
.
<EOS>
He
be
engage
to
dine
with
Madame
Max
Goesler
at
eight
,
and
in
his
agony
he
half
-
resolve
that
he
would
send
an
excuse
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
would
be
full
of
wrath
,
as
she
be
very
particular
about
her
little
dinner
-
party
;
 
but
,
what
do
he
care
now
about
the
wrath
of
Madame
Max
Goesler
?
<EOS>
and
yet
only
this
morning
he
have
be
congratulate
himself
,
among
his
other
success
,
upon
her
favour
,
and
have
laugh
inwardly
at
his
own
falseness
,
 
his
falseness
to
Violet
Effingham
,
 
as
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
something
to
himself
jocosely
about
lover
'
perjury
,
the
remembrance
of
which
be
now
very
bitter
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
take
up
a
sheet
of
note
-
paper
and
scrawl
an
excuse
to
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
news
from
the
country
,
he
say
,
make
it
impossible
that
he
should
go
out
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
send
the
note
.
<EOS>
at
about
half
-
past
five
he
open
the
door
of
his
private
secretary
's
room
and
find
the
young
man
fast
asleep
,
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
.
"
<EOS>
Halloa
,
Charles
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
right
!
"
<EOS>
Charles
Standish
be
a
first
cousin
of
Lady
Laura
's
,
and
,
have
be
in
the
office
before
Phineas
have
join
it
,
and
be
a
great
favourite
with
his
cousin
,
have
of
course
become
the
Under
-
Secretary
's
private
secretary
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
all
here
,
"
say
Charles
Standish
,
get
up
and
shake
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
.
<EOS>
just
tie
up
those
paper
,
 
exactly
as
they
be
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
here
early
to
-
morrow
,
but
I
shall
not
want
you
before
twelve
.
<EOS>
good
night
,
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ta
,
ta
,
"
say
his
private
secretary
,
who
be
very
fond
of
his
master
,
but
not
very
respectful
,
 
unless
upon
express
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
then
Phineas
go
out
and
walk
across
the
park
;
but
as
he
go
he
become
quite
aware
that
his
back
be
break
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
less
broken
because
he
sing
to
himself
little
song
to
prove
to
himself
that
it
be
whole
and
sound
.
<EOS>
It
be
break
,
and
it
seem
to
him
now
that
he
never
could
become
an
Atlas
again
,
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
world
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
what
do
anything
signify
?
<EOS>
all
that
he
have
do
have
be
part
of
a
game
which
he
have
be
play
throughout
,
and
now
he
have
be
beat
in
his
game
.
<EOS>
He
absolutely
ignore
his
old
passion
for
Lady
Laura
as
though
it
have
never
be
,
and
regard
himself
as
a
model
of
constancy
,
 
as
a
man
who
have
love
,
not
wisely
perhaps
,
but
much
too
well
,
 
and
who
must
now
therefore
suffer
a
live
death
.
<EOS>
He
hate
Parliament
.
<EOS>
He
hate
the
Colonial
Office
.
<EOS>
He
hate
his
friend
Mr.
Monk
;
and
he
especially
hate
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
as
to
Lord
Chiltern
,
 
he
believe
that
Lord
Chiltern
have
obtain
his
object
by
violence
.
<EOS>
He
would
see
to
that
!
<EOS>
yes
;
 
let
the
consequence
be
what
they
may
,
he
would
see
to
that
!
  
<EOS>
He
go
up
by
the
Duke
of
York
's
column
,
and
as
he
pass
the
Athenæum
he
see
his
chief
,
Lord
Cantrip
,
stand
under
the
portico
talk
to
a
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
go
on
unnoticed
,
have
it
be
possible
;
but
Lord
Cantrip
come
down
to
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
put
your
name
down
here
,
"
say
his
lordship
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
use
?
"
say
Phineas
,
who
be
profoundly
indifferent
at
this
moment
to
all
the
club
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
do
any
harm
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
will
come
up
in
time
.
<EOS>
and
if
you
should
get
into
the
ministry
,
they
will
let
you
in
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ministry
!
"
ejaculate
Phineas
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
Cantrip
take
the
tone
of
voice
as
simply
suggestive
of
humility
,
and
suspect
nothing
of
that
profound
indifference
to
all
minister
and
ministerial
honour
which
Phineas
have
intend
to
express
.
<EOS>
"
by
-
the
-
bye
,
"
say
Lord
Cantrip
,
put
his
arm
through
that
of
the
Under
-
Secretary
,
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
about
the
guarantee
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
in
the
devil
's
own
mess
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
"
and
so
the
Secretary
of
State
go
on
about
the
Rocky
Mountain
Railroad
,
and
Phineas
strove
hard
to
bear
his
burden
with
his
broken
back
.
<EOS>
He
be
oblige
to
say
something
about
the
guarantee
,
and
the
railway
,
and
the
frozen
harbour
,
 
and
something
especially
about
the
difficulty
which
would
be
find
,
not
in
the
measure
themselves
,
but
in
the
natural
pugnacity
of
the
Opposition
.
<EOS>
in
the
fabrication
of
garment
for
the
national
wear
,
the
great
thing
be
to
produce
garment
that
shall
,
as
far
as
possible
,
defy
hole
-
picking
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
,
and
sometimes
be
,
the
case
,
that
garment
so
fabricated
will
be
good
also
for
wear
.
<EOS>
Lord
Cantrip
,
at
the
present
moment
,
be
very
anxious
and
very
ingenious
in
the
stopping
of
hole
;
and
he
think
that
perhaps
his
Under
-
Secretary
be
too
much
prone
to
the
indulgence
of
large
philanthropical
view
without
sufficient
thought
of
the
hole
-
picker
.
<EOS>
but
on
this
occasion
,
by
the
time
that
he
reach
Brooks
's
,
he
have
be
enable
to
convince
his
Under
-
Secretary
,
and
though
he
have
always
think
well
of
his
Under
-
Secretary
,
he
think
better
of
him
now
than
ever
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
phinea
during
the
whole
time
have
be
meditate
what
he
could
do
to
Lord
Chiltern
when
they
two
should
meet
.
<EOS>
Could
he
take
him
by
the
throat
and
smite
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
happen
to
know
that
Broderick
be
work
as
hard
at
the
matter
as
we
be
,
"
say
Lord
Cantrip
,
stop
opposite
to
the
club
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
move
for
paper
,
you
know
,
at
the
end
of
last
session
.
"
<EOS>
now
Mr.
Broderick
be
a
gentleman
in
the
House
look
for
promotion
in
a
conservative
Government
,
and
of
course
would
oppose
any
measure
that
could
be
bring
forward
by
the
Cantrip
-
Finn
Colonial
Administration
.
<EOS>
then
Lord
Cantrip
slip
into
the
club
,
and
Phineas
go
on
alone
.
  
<EOS>
a
spark
of
his
old
ambition
with
reference
to
Brooks
's
be
the
first
thing
to
make
him
forget
his
misery
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
He
have
ask
Lord
Brentford
to
put
his
name
down
,
and
be
not
sure
whether
it
have
be
do
.
<EOS>
the
threat
of
Mr.
Broderick
's
opposition
have
be
of
no
use
towards
the
strengthening
of
his
break
back
,
but
the
sight
of
Lord
Cantrip
hurry
in
at
the
coveted
door
do
do
something
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
man
can
not
cut
his
throat
or
blow
his
brain
out
,
"
he
say
to
himself
;
"
after
all
,
he
must
go
on
and
do
his
work
.
<EOS>
for
heart
will
break
,
yet
brokenly
live
on
.
<EOS>
"
thereupon
he
go
home
,
and
after
sit
for
an
hour
over
his
own
fire
,
and
look
wistfully
at
a
little
treasure
which
he
have
,
 
a
treasure
obtain
by
some
slight
fraud
at
Saulsby
,
and
which
he
now
chuck
into
the
fire
,
and
then
instantly
again
pull
out
of
it
,
soil
but
unscorche
,
 
<EOS>
he
dress
himself
for
dinner
,
and
go
out
to
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
he
be
glad
that
he
have
not
send
the
note
of
excuse
.
<EOS>
a
man
must
live
,
even
though
his
heart
be
break
,
and
live
he
must
dine
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
be
fond
of
give
little
dinner
at
this
period
of
the
year
,
before
London
be
crowd
,
and
when
her
guest
may
probably
not
be
call
away
by
subsequent
social
arrangement
.
<EOS>
Her
number
seldom
exceed
six
or
eight
,
and
she
always
speak
of
these
entertainment
as
be
of
the
humble
kind
.
<EOS>
She
send
out
no
big
card
.
<EOS>
She
prefer
to
catch
her
people
as
though
by
chance
,
when
that
be
possible
.
"
<EOS>
dear
Mr.
Jones
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Smith
be
come
to
tell
me
about
some
sherry
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
and
tell
me
too
?
<EOS>
I
daresay
you
know
as
much
about
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
a
studious
absence
of
parade
.
<EOS>
the
dish
be
not
very
numerous
.
<EOS>
the
bill
of
fare
be
simply
write
out
once
,
for
the
mistress
,
and
so
circulate
round
the
table
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
about
the
thing
to
be
eat
or
the
thing
to
be
drunk
be
ever
speak
at
the
table
,
 
or
at
least
no
such
word
be
ever
speak
by
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
they
who
know
anything
about
dinner
be
aware
that
Madame
Goesler
give
very
good
dinner
indeed
.
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
be
begin
to
flatter
himself
that
he
know
something
about
dinner
,
and
have
be
hear
to
assert
that
the
soup
at
the
cottage
in
Park
Lane
be
not
to
be
beat
in
London
.
<EOS>
but
he
care
for
no
soup
to
-
day
,
as
he
slowly
make
his
way
up
Madame
Goesler
's
staircase
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
one
difficulty
in
the
way
of
Madame
Goesler
's
dinner
-
party
which
have
require
some
patience
and
great
ingenuity
in
its
management
.
<EOS>
She
must
either
have
lady
,
or
she
must
not
have
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
allurement
in
the
latter
alternative
;
but
she
know
well
that
if
she
give
way
to
it
,
all
prospect
of
general
society
would
for
her
be
close
,
 
and
for
ever
.
<EOS>
this
have
be
in
the
early
day
of
her
widowhood
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
She
care
but
little
for
woman
's
society
;
but
she
know
well
that
the
society
of
gentleman
without
woman
would
not
be
that
which
she
desire
.
<EOS>
She
know
also
that
she
may
as
effectually
crush
herself
and
all
her
aspiration
by
bring
to
her
house
indifferent
woman
,
 
woman
lack
something
either
in
character
,
or
in
position
,
or
in
talent
,
 
as
by
have
none
at
all
.
<EOS>
thus
there
have
be
a
great
difficulty
,
and
sometimes
she
have
think
that
the
thing
could
not
be
do
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
these
English
be
so
stiff
,
so
hard
,
so
heavy
!
"
<EOS>
and
yet
she
would
not
have
care
to
succeed
elsewhere
than
among
the
English
.
<EOS>
by
degree
,
however
,
the
thing
be
do
.
<EOS>
Her
prudence
equal
her
wit
,
and
even
suspicious
people
have
come
to
acknowledge
that
they
could
not
put
their
finger
on
anything
wrong
.
<EOS>
when
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
have
once
dine
at
the
cottage
in
Park
Lane
,
Madame
Max
Goesler
have
tell
herself
that
henceforth
she
do
not
care
what
the
suspicious
people
say
.
<EOS>
since
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
have
almost
promise
that
he
would
come
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
only
entertain
the
Duke
of
Omnium
she
would
have
do
everything
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
Duke
of
omnium
there
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
at
this
time
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
,
of
course
,
not
in
London
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
Fawn
be
there
;
and
our
old
friend
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
who
have
 
resign
his
place
at
the
Colonial
Office
;
and
there
be
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
They
,
with
our
hero
,
make
up
the
party
.
<EOS>
no
one
doubt
for
a
moment
to
what
source
Mr.
Bonteen
owe
his
dinner
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bonteen
be
good
-
look
,
could
talk
,
be
sufficiently
proper
,
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
,
 
and
do
as
well
as
any
other
woman
at
this
time
of
year
to
keep
Madame
Max
Goesler
in
countenance
.
<EOS>
there
be
never
any
sitting
after
dinner
at
the
cottage
;
or
,
I
should
rather
say
,
there
be
never
any
sitting
after
Madame
Goesler
go
;
so
that
the
two
lady
could
not
weary
each
other
by
be
alone
together
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bonteen
understand
quite
well
that
she
be
not
require
there
to
talk
to
her
hostess
,
and
be
as
willing
as
any
woman
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
the
gentleman
she
may
meet
at
Madame
Goesler
's
table
.
<EOS>
and
thus
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
not
unfrequently
dine
in
Park
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
we
have
only
to
wait
for
that
horrible
man
,
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
,
"
say
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
as
she
welcome
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
always
late
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
blow
for
me
!
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
 
you
be
always
in
good
time
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
limit
beyond
which
good
time
end
,
and
be
shamefully
late
at
once
begin
.
<EOS>
but
here
he
be
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
enter
the
room
,
Madame
Goesler
ring
the
bell
for
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
find
himself
place
between
his
hostess
and
Mr.
Bonteen
,
and
Lord
Fawn
be
on
the
other
side
of
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
They
be
hardly
seat
at
the
table
before
some
one
state
it
as
a
fact
that
Lord
Brentford
and
his
son
be
reconcile
.
<EOS>
now
Phineas
know
,
or
think
that
he
know
,
that
this
could
not
as
yet
be
the
case
;
and
indeed
such
be
not
the
case
,
though
the
father
have
already
receive
the
son
's
letter
.
<EOS>
but
Phineas
do
not
choose
to
say
anything
at
present
about
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
odd
it
be
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
;
"
how
often
you
english
father
quarrel
with
your
son
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
often
we
english
son
quarrel
with
our
father
rather
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
who
be
know
for
the
respect
he
have
always
pay
to
the
fifth
commandment
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
all
come
from
entail
and
primogeniture
,
and
old
-
fashioned
english
prejudice
of
that
kind
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
be
a
friend
of
yours
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
both
friend
of
mine
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
yes
;
but
you
,
 
you
,
 
you
and
Lord
Chiltern
once
do
something
odd
together
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
mystery
,
be
there
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
little
of
a
mystery
now
,
"
say
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
about
a
lady
;
 
be
it
not
?
"
say
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
affect
to
whisper
to
her
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
at
liberty
to
say
anything
on
the
subject
,
"
say
Fitzgibbon
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
Phineas
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
this
about
Lord
Brentford
,
"
say
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
I
happen
to
know
that
Chiltern
be
down
at
Loughlinter
three
day
ago
,
and
that
he
pass
through
London
yesterday
on
his
way
to
the
place
where
he
hunt
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
be
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
go
to
Saulsby
if
it
be
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
all
depend
upon
whether
Miss
Effingham
will
accept
him
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
look
over
at
Phineas
as
she
speak
.
  
<EOS>
as
there
be
two
of
Violet
Effingham
's
suitor
at
table
,
the
subject
be
become
disagreeably
personal
;
and
the
more
so
,
as
every
one
of
the
party
know
or
surmise
something
of
the
fact
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
the
cause
of
the
duel
at
Blankenberg
have
become
almost
as
public
as
the
duel
,
and
Lord
Fawn
's
courtship
have
not
be
altogether
hide
from
the
public
eye
.
<EOS>
He
on
the
present
occasion
may
probably
be
able
to
carry
himself
better
than
Phineas
,
even
presume
him
to
be
equally
eager
in
his
love
,
 
for
he
know
nothing
of
the
fatal
truth
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
unable
to
hear
Mrs.
Bonteen
's
statement
with
indifference
,
and
show
his
concern
in
the
matter
by
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
any
lady
will
be
much
to
be
pity
,
"
he
say
,
"
who
do
that
.
<EOS>
Chiltern
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
whom
I
would
wish
to
trust
the
happiness
of
a
woman
for
whom
I
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Chiltern
be
a
very
good
fellow
,
"
say
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
a
little
wild
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
never
have
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
in
his
life
,
"
say
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
regard
him
as
simply
a
madman
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
wish
I
know
him
,
"
say
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
fond
of
madman
,
and
man
who
have
not
shilling
,
and
who
be
a
little
wild
,
Could
you
not
bring
him
here
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
do
not
know
what
to
say
,
or
how
to
open
his
mouth
without
show
his
deep
concern
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
happy
to
ask
him
if
you
wish
it
,
"
he
reply
,
as
though
the
question
have
be
put
to
him
in
earnest
;
"
but
I
do
not
see
so
much
of
Lord
Chiltern
as
I
use
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
believe
that
Violet
Effingham
will
accept
him
?
"
ask
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
He
pause
a
moment
before
he
speak
,
and
then
make
his
answer
in
a
deep
solemn
voice
,
 
with
a
seriousness
which
he
be
unable
to
repress
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
accept
him
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
that
you
know
it
?
"
say
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
mean
that
I
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
have
anybody
tell
him
beforehand
that
he
would
openly
make
this
declaration
at
Madame
Goesler
's
table
,
he
would
have
say
that
of
all
thing
it
be
the
most
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
declare
that
nothing
would
have
induce
him
to
speak
of
Violet
Effingham
in
his
exist
frame
of
mind
,
and
that
he
would
have
have
his
tongue
cut
out
before
he
speak
of
her
as
the
promised
bride
of
his
rival
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
have
declare
the
whole
truth
of
his
own
wretchedness
and
discomfiture
.
<EOS>
He
be
well
aware
that
all
of
them
there
know
why
he
have
fight
the
duel
at
Blankenberg
;
 
<EOS>
all
,
that
is
,
except
perhaps
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
and
he
feel
as
he
make
the
statement
as
to
Lord
Chiltern
that
he
blush
up
to
his
forehead
,
and
that
his
voice
be
strange
,
and
that
he
be
tell
the
tale
of
his
own
disgrace
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
direct
question
have
be
ask
him
he
have
be
unable
to
refrain
from
answer
it
directly
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
of
turn
it
off
with
some
jest
or
affectation
of
drollery
,
but
have
fail
.
<EOS>
at
the
moment
he
have
be
unable
not
to
speak
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
 
who
also
forget
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe
it
,
if
Mr.
Finn
say
so
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
who
rather
like
the
confusion
she
have
cause
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
who
could
have
tell
you
,
Finn
?
"
ask
Mr.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
sister
,
Lady
Laura
,
tell
me
so
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
must
be
true
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
impossible
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
may
say
that
I
know
that
it
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
it
would
be
a
most
shameful
arrangement
.
<EOS>
every
shilling
she
have
in
the
world
would
be
swallow
up
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
Lord
Fawn
in
make
his
proposal
have
be
magnanimous
in
his
offer
as
to
settlement
and
pecuniary
provision
generally
.
  
<EOS>
for
some
minute
after
that
Phineas
do
not
speak
another
word
,
and
the
conversation
generally
be
not
so
brisk
and
bright
as
it
be
expect
to
be
at
Madame
Goesler
's
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
herself
thoroughly
understand
our
hero
's
position
,
and
feel
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
encourage
no
questioning
about
Violet
Effingham
<EOS>
have
she
think
that
they
would
have
lead
to
such
a
result
,
and
now
she
exert
herself
to
turn
the
mind
of
her
guest
to
other
subject
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
succeed
;
and
after
a
while
,
too
,
Phineas
himself
be
able
to
talk
.
<EOS>
He
drink
two
or
three
glass
of
wine
,
and
dash
away
into
politic
,
take
the
early
opportunity
in
his
power
of
contradict
Lord
Fawn
very
plainly
on
one
or
two
matter
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
be
of
course
of
opinion
that
the
ministry
could
not
stay
in
long
.
<EOS>
since
he
have
leave
the
Government
the
minister
have
make
wonderful
mistake
,
and
he
speak
of
them
quite
as
an
enemy
may
speak
.
"
<EOS>
and
yet
,
Fitz
,
"
say
Mr.
Bonteen
,
"
you
use
to
be
so
staunch
a
supporter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
the
error
of
my
way
,
I
can
assure
you
,
"
say
Laurence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
observe
,
"
say
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
"
that
when
any
of
you
gentleman
resign
,
 
which
you
usually
do
on
some
very
trivial
matter
,
 
the
resign
gentleman
become
of
all
foe
the
bitter
.
<EOS>
somebody
go
on
very
well
with
his
friend
,
agree
most
cordially
about
everything
,
till
he
find
that
his
public
virtue
can
not
swallow
some
little
detail
,
and
then
he
resign
.
<EOS>
or
some
one
,
perhaps
,
on
the
other
side
have
attack
him
,
and
in
the
mêlée
he
be
hurt
,
and
so
he
resign
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
resign
,
and
make
his
parting
speech
full
of
love
and
gratitude
,
I
know
well
after
that
where
to
look
for
the
bitter
hostility
to
his
late
friend
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
be
begin
to
understand
the
way
in
which
politic
be
do
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
rather
severe
upon
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
;
but
he
be
a
man
of
the
world
,
and
bore
it
better
than
Phineas
have
bear
his
defeat
.
  
<EOS>
the
dinner
,
take
altogether
,
be
not
a
success
,
and
so
Madame
Goesler
understand
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
after
he
have
be
contradict
by
Phineas
,
hardly
open
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
Phineas
himself
talk
rather
too
much
and
rather
too
loudly
;
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
who
be
well
enough
incline
to
flatter
Lord
Fawn
,
contradict
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
make
a
mistake
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
afterwards
,
"
in
have
four
member
of
Parliament
who
all
of
them
be
or
have
be
in
office

I
never
will
have
two
man
in
office
together
again

this
she
say
to
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Madame
Max
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
"
your
resolution
ought
to
be
that
you
will
never
again
have
two
claimant
for
the
same

<EOS>
in
the
drawing
-
room
up

stair
Madame
Goesler
manage
to
be
alone
for
three
minute
with
Phineas
Finn
.
"
<EOS>
and
it
be
as
you
say
,
my
friend
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
be
plaintive
and
soft
,
and
there
be
a
look
of
real
sympathy
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
Phineas
almost
feel
that
if
they
two
have
be
quite
alone
he
could
have
tell
her
everything
,
and
have
weep
at
her
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
say
,
"
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
doubt
it
when
you
have
declare
it
.
<EOS>
May
I
venture
to
say
that
I
wish
it
have
be
otherwise
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
too
late
now
,
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
a
man
of
course
be
a
fool
to
show
that
he
have
any
feeling
in
such
a
matter
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
I
hear
it
just
before
I
come
here
,
and
have
make
up
my
mind
to
send
you
an
excuse
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
say
that
,
Mr.
Finn
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
make
such
an
ass
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
my
estimation
you
have
do
yourself
honour
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
may
venture
to
give
you
counsel
,
do
not
speak
of
this
affair
again
as
though
you
have
be
personally
concern
in
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
world
now
-
a
-
day
the
only
thing
disgraceful
be
to
admit
a
failure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
have
fail
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
need
not
admit
it
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
ought
not
to
say
as
much
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
rather
,
be
deeply
indebted
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
now
,
Madame
Goesler
,
as
I
do
not
wish
to
leave
the
house
with
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
come
and
see
me
soon
.
"
<EOS>
then
Phineas
promise
that
he
would
come
soon
;
and
feel
as
he
make
the
promise
that
he
would
have
an
opportunity
of
talk
over
his
love
with
his
new
friend
at
any
rate
without
fresh
shame
as
to
his
failure
.
  
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
go
away
with
Phineas
,
and
Mr.
Bonteen
,
have
send
his
wife
away
by
herself
,
walk
off
towards
the
club
with
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
anxious
to
have
a
few
word
with
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
have
evidently
be
annoy
by
Phineas
,
and
Mr.
Bonteen
do
not
at
all
love
the
young
Under
-
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
that
fellow
have
become
the
most
consummate
puppy
I
ever
meet
,
"
say
he
,
as
he
link
himself
on
to
the
lord
,
"
Monk
,
and
one
or
two
other
among
them
,
have
contrive
to
spoil
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
a
word
of
what
he
say
about
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
his
marriage
with
Miss
Effingham
?
"
  
"
It
would
be
such
an
abominable
shame
to
sacrifice
the
girl
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
everything
be
go
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
a
drunkard
,
and
I
do
not
believe
he
be
any
more
reconcile
to
his
father
than
you
be
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
must
have
have
some
object
in
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
perhaps
an
invention
of
Finn
's
altogether
,
"
say
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
those
irish
fellow
be
just
the
man
for
that
kind
of
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
man
,
you
know
,
so
violent
that
nobody
can
hold
him
,
"
say
Lord
Fawn
,
thinking
of
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
so
absurdly
conceited
,
"
say
Mr.
Bonteen
,
thinking
of
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
man
who
have
never
do
anything
,
with
all
his
advantage
in
the
world
,
 
and
never
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
hold
his
place
long
,
"
say
Mr.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
whom
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
be
talk
of
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
I
believe
Finn
to
be
a
very
good
sort
of
a
fellow
,
and
he
be
undoubtedly
clever
.
<EOS>
They
say
Cantrip
like
him
amazingly
.
<EOS>
He
will
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
believe
a
word
of
this
about
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Bonteen
feel
himself
to
be
snub
,
and
soon
afterwards
leave
Lord
Fawn
alone
.
   
<EOS>
consolation
 
<EOS>
on
the
day
follow
Madame
Goesler
's
dinner
party
,
Phineas
,
though
he
be
early
at
his
office
,
be
not
able
to
do
much
work
,
still
feel
that
as
regard
the
reality
of
the
world
,
his
back
be
break
.
<EOS>
He
may
no
doubt
go
on
learning
,
and
,
after
a
time
,
may
be
able
to
exert
himself
in
a
perhaps
useful
,
but
altogether
unintereste
kind
of
way
,
do
his
work
simply
because
it
be
there
to
be
do
,
 
as
the
carter
or
the
tailor
do
his
;
 
and
from
the
same
cause
,
know
that
a
man
must
have
bread
to
live
.
<EOS>
but
as
for
ambition
,
and
the
idea
of
do
good
,
and
the
love
of
work
for
work
's
sake
,
 
as
for
the
elastic
spring
of
delicious
and
beneficent
labour
,
 
all
that
be
over
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
work
from
day
till
night
,
and
from
night
till
day
,
and
from
month
till
month
throughout
the
year
to
have
secure
for
Violet
Effingham
the
assurance
that
her
husband
's
position
be
worthy
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
have
no
motive
for
such
work
as
this
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
he
take
the
public
pay
,
he
would
earn
it
;
and
that
be
all
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
thing
be
a
little
well
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
receive
a
note
in
the
morning
from
Lord
Cantrip
say
that
they
two
be
to
see
the
Prime
Minister
that
evening
,
in
order
that
the
whole
question
of
the
railway
to
the
Rocky
Mountains
may
be
understand
,
and
Phineas
be
drive
to
his
work
.
<EOS>
before
the
time
of
the
meeting
come
he
have
once
more
lose
his
own
identity
in
great
idea
of
colonial
welfare
,
and
have
plan
and
people
a
mighty
region
on
the
Red
River
,
which
should
have
no
sympathy
with
american
democracy
.
<EOS>
when
he
wait
upon
Mr.
Gresham
in
the
afternoon
he
say
nothing
about
the
mighty
region
;
indeed
,
he
leave
it
to
Lord
Cantrip
to
explain
most
of
the
propose
arrangement
,
 
speak
only
a
word
or
two
here
<EOS>
and
there
as
occasion
require
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
aware
that
he
have
so
far
recover
as
to
be
able
to
save
himself
from
lose
ground
during
the
interview
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
about
the
first
Irishman
we
have
have
that
have
be
worth
his
salt
,
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
to
his
colleague
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
other
Irishman
be
a
terrible
fellow
,
"
say
Lord
Cantrip
,
shake
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
fourth
day
after
his
sorrow
have
befall
him
,
Phineas
go
again
to
the
cottage
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
and
in
order
that
he
may
not
be
balk
in
his
search
for
sympathy
he
write
a
line
to
Madame
Goesler
to
ask
if
she
would
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
at
home
from
five
to
six
,
 
and
alone
.
 
<EOS>
M.
M.
G.
"
<EOS>
that
be
the
answer
from
Marie
Max
Goesler
,
and
Phineas
be
of
course
at
the
cottage
a
few
minute
after
five
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
I
think
,
surprise
that
a
man
when
he
want
sympathy
in
such
a
calamity
as
that
which
have
now
befall
Phineas
Finn
,
should
seek
it
from
a
woman
.
<EOS>
woman
sympathise
most
effectually
with
man
,
as
man
do
with
woman
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
,
perhaps
,
a
little
odd
that
a
man
when
he
want
consolation
because
his
heart
have
be
break
,
always
like
to
receive
it
from
a
pretty
woman
.
<EOS>
one
would
be
dispose
to
think
that
at
such
a
moment
he
would
be
profoundly
indifferent
to
such
a
matter
,
that
no
delight
could
come
to
him
from
female
beauty
,
and
that
all
he
would
want
would
be
the
softness
of
a
simply
sympathetic
soul
.
<EOS>
but
he
generally
want
a
soft
hand
as
well
,
and
an
eye
that
can
be
bright
behind
the
mutual
tear
,
and
lip
that
shall
be
young
and
fresh
as
they
express
their
concern
for
his
sorrow
.
<EOS>
all
these
thing
be
add
to
Phineas
when
he
go
to
Madame
Goesler
in
his
grief
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
to
see
you
,
"
say
Madame
Max
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
good
-
natured
to
let
me
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
but
<EOS>
it
be
so
good
of
you
to
trust
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
sure
you
would
come
after
what
take
place
the
other
night
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
you
be
pain
,
and
I
be
so
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
make
such
a
fool
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
that
you
be
right
to
tell
them
when
the
question
have
be
ask
.
<EOS>
if
the
thing
be
not
to
be
keep
a
secret
,
it
be
well
to
speak
it
out
.
<EOS>
You
will
get
over
it
quicker
in
that
way
than
in
any
other
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
the
young
lord
,
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
there
be
nothing
amiss
about
him
.
<EOS>
as
to
what
Lord
Fawn
say
,
the
half
of
it
be
simply
exaggeration
,
and
the
other
half
be
misunderstood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
this
country
it
be
so
much
to
be
a
lord
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
think
a
moment
of
that
matter
before
he
reply
.
<EOS>
all
the
standish
family
have
be
very
good
to
him
,
and
Violet
Effingham
have
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
fault
of
any
of
them
that
he
be
now
wretched
and
back
-
break
.
<EOS>
He
have
meditate
much
on
this
,
and
have
resolve
that
he
would
not
even
think
evil
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
in
my
heart
believe
that
that
have
have
anything
to
do
with
it
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
have
,
my
friend
,
 
always
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
your
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
I
do
not
know
this
violet
that
be
not
yours
.
<EOS>
I
have
meet
her
,
and
do
not
specially
admire
her
.
<EOS>
but
then
the
taste
of
man
and
woman
about
beauty
be
never
the
same
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
she
be
one
that
always
live
with
lord
and
countess
.
<EOS>
a
girl
who
always
live
with
countess
feel
it
to
be
hard
to
settle
down
as
a
plain
Mistress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
have
plenty
of
choice
among
all
sort
of
man
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
title
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
accept
Chiltern
unless
she
have
 
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
use
of
talk
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
know
each
other
long
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
 
as
child
.
<EOS>
and
the
Earl
desire
it
of
all
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
 
then
he
arrange
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
exactly
.
<EOS>
nobody
could
arrange
anything
for
Chiltern
,
 
nor
,
as
far
as
that
go
,
for
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
They
arrange
it
themselves
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
ask
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
twice
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
refuse
him
more
than
twice
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
for
which
to
blame
her
;
but
yet
I
have
think
,
 
I
have
think
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
be
a
jilt
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
I
will
not
let
you
say
that
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
no
jilt
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
she
have
be
strangely
ignorant
of
her
own
mind
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
talk
of
it
,
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
none
;
 
<EOS>
only
sometimes
it
be
well
to
speak
a
word
,
than
to
keep
one
's
sorrow
to
oneself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
it
be
;
 
and
there
be
not
one
in
the
world
to
whom
I
can
speak
such
a
word
,
except
yourself
.
<EOS>
be
not
that
odd
?
<EOS>
I
have
sister
,
but
they
have
never
hear
of
Miss
Effingham
,
and
would
be
quite
indifferent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
they
have
some
other
favourite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
 
well
.
<EOS>
that
do
not
matter
,
and
my
good
friend
here
in
London
be
Lord
Chiltern
's
own
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
know
of
your
attachment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
.
"
  
"
and
she
tell
you
of
Miss
Effingham
's
engagement
.
<EOS>
be
she
glad
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
always
desire
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
think
she
would
have
be
satisfy
have
it
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
but
of
course
her
heart
must
be
with
her
brother
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
have
trouble
myself
to
go
to
Blankenberg
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
for
the
good
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
everybody
say
you
behave
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
but
go
,
as
thing
be
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
if
you
have
 
shoot
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
would
have
be
an
end
of
everything
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
have
see
me
after
that
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
should
have
shoot
myself
next
,
feel
that
there
be
nothing
else
leave
for
me
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
 
you
English
be
so
peculiar
.
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
it
be
good
not
to
shoot
a
man
.
<EOS>
and
,
Mr.
Finn
,
there
be
other
lady
in
the
world
pretty
than
Miss
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
no
;
 
of
course
you
will
not
admit
that
now
.
<EOS>
just
at
this
moment
,
and
for
a
month
or
two
,
she
be
peerless
,
and
you
will
feel
yourself
to
be
of
all
man
the
most
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
the
ball
at
your
foot
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
one
so
young
who
have
get
the
ball
at
his
foot
so
well
.
<EOS>
I
call
it
nothing
to
have
the
ball
at
your
foot
if
you
be
bear
with
it
there
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
easy
to
be
a
lord
if
your
father
be
one
before
you
,
 
and
so
easy
to
marry
a
pretty
girl
if
you
can
make
her
a
countess
.
<EOS>
but
to
make
yourself
a
lord
,
or
to
be
as
good
as
a
lord
,
when
nothing
have
be
bear
to
you
,
 
that
I
call
very
much
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
woman
,
and
pretty
woman
too
,
Mr.
Finn
,
who
have
spirit
enough
to
understand
this
,
and
to
think
that
the
man
,
after
all
,
be
more
important
than
the
lord
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
sing
the
old
well
-
wear
verse
of
the
Scotch
song
with
wonderful
spirit
,
and
with
a
clearness
of
voice
and
knowledge
of
music
for
which
he
have
hitherto
never
give
her
credit
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
prince
can
mak

a

knight

<EOS>

now

then

something
specially
require

I
be
very
fond
of
Scotch
song

<EOS>
I
will
sing
to
you
now

you
like
it

<EOS>
then
she
sing
the
whole
song
,
 
"
a
man

a

say
as
she
finish

though
he
can
not

special
bit
of
paint
Eve

flesh
for
which
his
heart
have
have
a
craving

"
<EOS>
then
she
sing
again
:
    
"
there
be
maiden
in
Scotland
more
lovely
by
far
,
who
would
gladly
be
bride
to
the
young
Lochinvar

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
young
Lochinvar
get
his
bride
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
the
spirit
of
the
line
,
Mr.
Finn
,
which
be
true
;
and
not
the
tale
as
it
be
tell
,
which
be
probably
false
.
<EOS>
I
often
think
that
Jock
of
Hazledean
,
and
young
Lochinvar
too
,
probably
live
to
repent
their
bargain
.
<EOS>
We
will
hope
that
Lord
Chiltern
may
not
do
so
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
never
will

that
be
all
right

and
as
for
you
,
do
you
for
a
while
think
of
your
politic
,
and
your
speech

and
your
colony

rather

of
your
love

You
be
at

there

no
Lord
Chiltern
can
rob
you
of
your
success

if
you
be
down
in

mouth

come
to
me

and
I
will
sing
you
a
Scotch
song

<EOS>
and
,
look
you
,
the
next
time
I
ask
you
to
dinner
I
will
promise
you
that
Mrs.
Bonteen

not

"
<EOS>
She
give
him
her
hand
,
which
be
very
soft
,
and
leave
it
for
a
moment
in
his
,
and
he
be
console
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
,
when
she
be
alone
,
throw
herself
on
to
her
chair
and
begin
to
think
of
thing
.
<EOS>
in
these
day
she
would
often
ask
herself
what
in
truth
be
the
object
of
her
ambition
,
and
the
aim
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
now
at
this
moment
she
have
in
her
hand
a
note
from
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
have
allow
himself
to
say
something
about
a
photograph
,
which
have
justify
her
in
write
to
him
,
 
or
which
she
have
take
for
such
justification
.
<EOS>
and
the
Duke
have
reply
.
<EOS>
"
He
would
not
,
"
he
say
,
"
lose
the
opportunity
of
wait
upon
her
in
person
which
the
presentation
of
the
little
gift
may
afford
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
great
success
to
have
the
Duke
of
Omnium
at
her
house
,
 
but
to
what
would
the
success
reach
?
<EOS>
what
be
her
definite
object
,
 
or
have
she
any
?
<EOS>
in
what
way
could
she
make
herself
happy
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
say
that
she
be
happy
yet
.
<EOS>
the
hour
with
her
be
too
long
and
the
day
too
many
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Omnium
should
come
,
 
if
he
would
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
quite
resolve
as
to
this
,
 
that
if
the
Duke
do
come
she
would
not
be
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
what
would
be
the
feeling
of
such
a
woman
as
her
,
be
the
world
to
greet
her
some
fine
morning
as
Duchess
of
Omnium
!
<EOS>
then
she
make
up
her
mind
very
resolutely
on
one
subject
.
<EOS>
Should
the
Duke
give
her
any
opportunity
she
would
take
a
very
short
time
in
let
him
know
what
be
the
extent
of
her
ambition
.
   
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
at
Saulsby
 
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
do
exactly
as
he
say
he
would
do
.
<EOS>
He
write
to
his
father
as
he
pass
through
Carlisle
,
and
at
once
go
on
to
his
hunting
at
Willingford
.
<EOS>
but
his
letter
be
very
stiff
and
ungainly
,
and
it
may
be
doubt
whether
Miss
Effingham
be
not
wrong
in
refuse
the
offer
which
he
have
make
to
her
as
to
the
dictation
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
begin
his
letter
,
"
My
Lord
,
"
and
do
not
much
improve
the
style
as
he
go
on
with
it
.
<EOS>
the
reader
may
as
well
see
the
whole
letter
;
    
Railway

<EOS>
my
LORD
,
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
on
my
way
from
Loughlinter
to
London
,
and
write
this
letter
to
you
in
compliance
with
a
promise
make
by
me
to
my
sister
and
to
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
I
have
ask
Violet
to
be
my
wife
,
and
she
have
accept
me
,
and
they
think
that
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
this
have
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
,
of
course
,
oblige
,
if
you
will
instruct
Mr.
Edwards
to
let
me
know
what
you
would
propose
to
do
in
regard
to
settlement
.
<EOS>
Laura
think
that
you
will
wish
to
see
both
Violet
and
myself
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
can
only
say
that
,
should
you
desire
me
to
come
,
I
will
do
so
on
receive
your
assurance
that
I
shall
be
treat
neither
with
fat
calf
nor
with
reproach
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
that
I
have
deserve
either
.

I
be

my
lord
,
yours

CHILTERN
.
  
<EOS>
P.S.
 
<EOS>
My
address
will
be
"
the
Bull
,
Willingford
.
"
  
<EOS>
that
last
word
,
in
which
he
half
-
declare
himself
to
be
join
in
affectionate
relation
to
his
father
,
cause
him
a
world
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
find
no
term
for
express
,
without
a
circumlocution
which
be
disagreeable
to
him
,
exactly
that
position
of
feeling
towards
his
father
which
really
belong
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
write
"
your
with
affection
,
"
or
"
yours
with
deadly
enmity
,
"
or
"
yours
with
respect
,
"
or
"
yours
with
most
profound
indifference
,
"
exactly
in
accordance
with
the
state
of
his
father
's
mind
,
if
he
have
only
know
what
be
that
state
.
<EOS>
He
be
afraid
of
go
beyond
his
father
in
any
offer
of
reconciliation
,
and
be
firmly
fix
in
his
resolution
that
he
would
never
be
either
repentant
or
submissive
in
regard
to
the
past
.
<EOS>
if
his
father
have
wish
for
the
future
,
he
would
comply
with
them
if
he
could
do
so
without
unreasonable
inconvenience
,
but
he
would
not
give
way
a
single
point
as
to
thing
do
and
go
.
<EOS>
if
his
father
should
choose
to
make
any
reference
to
them
,
his
father
must
prepare
for
battle
.
  
<EOS>
the
Earl
be
of
course
disgust
by
the
pertinacious
obstinacy
of
his
son
's
letter
,
and
for
an
hour
or
two
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
not
answer
it
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
natural
that
the
father
should
yearn
for
the
son
,
while
the
son
's
feeling
for
the
father
be
of
a
very
much
weak
nature
.
<EOS>
here
,
at
any
rate
,
be
that
engagement
make
which
he
have
ever
desire
.
<EOS>
and
his
son
have
make
a
step
,
though
it
be
so
very
unsatisfactory
a
step
,
towards
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
when
the
old
man
read
the
letter
a
second
time
,
he
skip
that
reference
to
fat
calf
which
have
be
so
peculiarly
distasteful
to
him
,
and
before
the
evening
have
pass
he
have
answer
his
son
as
follow
;
    
Saulsby
,
December
29
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
chiltern

I
have
receive
your
letter
,
and
be
truly
delighted
to
hear
that
dear
Violet
have
accept
you
as
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Her
fortune
will
be
very
material
to
you
,
but
she
herself
be
well
than
any
fortune
.
<EOS>
You
have
long
know
my
opinion
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
proud
to
welcome
her
as
a
daughter
to
my
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
of
course
write
to
her
immediately
,
and
will
endeavour
to
settle
some
early
day
for
her

here
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
do
so
,
I
will
write
to

I
will
endeavour

make
Saulsby
comfortable
to
you

<EOS>
Your

father
,
  
BRENTFORD
.
  
<EOS>
Richards
,
the
groom
,
be
still

<EOS>
You
have
perhaps
better
write
to
him
direct
about
your
horse
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
middle
of
February
arrangement
have
all
be
make
,
and
Violet
meet
her
lover
at
his
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
in
the
meantime
have
be
with
her
aunt
,
and
have
undergo
a
good
deal
of
mild
unceasing
persecution
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
violet
,
"
say
her
aunt
to
her
on
her
arrival
at
Baddingham
,
speak
with
a
solemnity
that
ought
to
have
be
terrible
to
the
young
lady
,
"
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
you

<EOS>
"
I

Lady
Baldock

with
an
increase
of
awe
-
inspire
severity
in
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
say
nothing
about
it
at
all
,
if
you
do
not
like
it

"
say
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
say
nothing
about
it
?
<EOS>
how
can
I
be
silent
?
<EOS>
or
how
be
I
to
congratulate
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
least
say
,
perhaps
,
the
soon

"
and
Violet
smile
as
she
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
well
,
and
if
I
have
no
duty
to
perform
,
I
would
be
silent
.
<EOS>
but
,
Violet
,
you
have
be
leave
in
my
charge
.
<EOS>
if
I
see
you
shipwreck
in
life
,
I
shall
ever
tell
myself
that
the
fault
have
be
partly
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
aunt
,
that
will
be
quite
unnecessary

<EOS>
I
will
always
admit
that
you
do
everything
in
your
power
to
 
to
 
to
 
<EOS>
make
me

I
still
hope
that
I
shall
be
find

You
will
find
that

not
so
black

why
take
anybody

I

<EOS>
the
same
thing
be
repeat
over

over
again
during
the
month
that
Miss

remain
at
Baddingham
,
but
Lady
Baldock
have
no
power
of
interfering
,
and
Violet
bear
her
persecution
bravely
.
<EOS>
Her
future
husband
be
generally
speak
of
as
"
that
violent
young
man
,
"
and
hint
be
throw
out
as
to
the
personal
injury
to
which
his
wife
may
be
possibly
subject
.
<EOS>
but
the
threaten
bride
only
laugh
,
and
speak
of
these
come
danger
as
part
of
the
general
lot
of
married
woman

I

the

be

as
Violet
well
know

that
"
my

have
be
dumb
as
a
sheep
before
the
shearer
in
the
hand
of
his
wife
,
and
have
never
be
know
to
do
anything
improper
by
those
who
have
be
most
intimate
with
him
even
in
his
early
day
.
"
<EOS>
Your
uncle
Baldock
,
miss
,
"
say
the
outraged
aunt
,
"
be
a
nobleman
as
different
in
his
manner
of
life
from
Lord
Chiltern
as
chalk
from
cheese
.
"
<EOS>
"
but
then
come
the
question
,
which
be
the
cheese
?
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
would
not
argue
the
question
any
further
,
but
stalk
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
meet
them
at
Saulsby
,
have
have
something
of
a
battle
with
her
husband
before
she
leave
her
home
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
when
she
tell
him
of
her
desire
to
assist
at
this
reconciliation
between
her
father
and
brother
,
he
reply
by
point
out
that
her
first
duty
be
at
Loughlinter
,
and
before
the
interview
be
end
have
come
to
express
an
opinion
that
that
duty
be
very
much
neglect
.
<EOS>
She
in
the
meantime
have
declare
that
she
would
go
to
Saulsby
,
or
that
she
would
explain
to
her
father
that
she
be
forbid
by
her
husband
to
do
so
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
also
forbid
any
such
communication
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
which
,
Lady
Laura
tell
him
that
there
be
some
marital
command
which
she
should
not
consider
it
to
be
her
duty
to
obey
.
<EOS>
when
matter
have
come
to
this
pass
,
it
may
be
conceive
that
both
Mr.
Kennedy
and
his
wife
be
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
She
have
almost
resolve
that
she
would
take
step
to
enable
her
to
live
apart
from
her
husband
;
and
he
have
begin
to
consider
what
course
he
would
pursue
if
such
step
be
take
.
<EOS>
the
wife
be
subject
to
her
husband
by
the
law
both
of
God
and
man
;
and
Mr.
Kennedy
be
one
who
think
much
of
such
law
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
Lady
Laura
carry
her
point
and
go
to
Saulsby
,
leave
her
husband
to
go
up
to
London
and
begin
the
session
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
and
Violet
be
both
at
Saulsby
before
Lord
Chiltern
arrive
,
and
many
be
the
consultation
which
be
hold
between
them
as
to
the
good
mode
in
which
thing
may
be
arrange
.
<EOS>
Violet
be
of
opinion
that
there
have
better
be
no
arrangement
,
that
Lord
Chiltern
should
be
allow
to
come
in
and
take
his
father
's
hand
,
and
sit
down
to
dinner
,
 
and
that
so
thing
should
fall
into
their
place
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
be
rather
in
favour
of
some
scene
.
<EOS>
but
the
interview
have
take
place
before
either
of
them
be
able
to
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
on
his
arrival
,
have
go
immediately
to
his
father
,
take
the
Earl
very
much
by
surprise
,
and
have
come
off
best
in
the
encounter
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
say
he
,
walk
up
to
his
father
with
his
hand
out
,
"
I
be
very
glad
to
come
back
to
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
write
to
his
sister
to
say
that
he
would
be
at
Saulsby
on
that
day
,
but
have
name
no
hour
.
<EOS>
He
now
appear
between
ten
and
eleven
in
the
morning
,
and
his
father
have
as
yet
make
no
preparation
for
him
,
 
have
arrange
no
appropriate
word
.
<EOS>
He
have
walk
in
at
the
front
door
,
and
have
ask
for
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
be
in
his
own
morning
-
room
,
 
a
gloomy
room
,
full
of
dark
book
and
dark
furniture
,
and
thither
Lord
Chiltern
have
at
once
go
.
<EOS>
the
two
woman
still
be
sit
together
over
the
fire
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
and
know
nothing
of
his
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
!
"
say
his
father
,
"
I
hardly
expect
you
so
early
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
early
.
<EOS>
I
come
across
country
,
and
sleep
at
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Violet
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
she
be
here
,
 
and
Laura
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
so
be
I.
"
<EOS>
and
the
father
take
the
son
's
hand
for
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
,
look
his
father
full
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
very
much
pleased
by
this
engagement
,
"
continue
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
I
must
be
,
then
?
"
say
the
son
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
at
it
,
you
know
,
off
and
on
,
ever
so
many
year
;
and
have
sometimes
think
I
be
quite
a
fool
not
to
get
it
out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
get
it
out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
and
now
she
talk
as
though
it
be
she
who
have
be
in
love
with
me
all
the
time
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
she
be
,
"
say
the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
it
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
a
little
so
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
mean
that
she
always
shall
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
the
bad
husband
in
the
world
,
I
hope
;
and
I
be
quite
sure
I
shall
not
be
the
good
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
see
her
now
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
shall
find
her
somewhere
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
best
to
see
you
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
stop
half
a
moment
,
Oswald
,
"
say
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
and
then
Lord
Brentford
do
make
something
of
a
shambling
speech
,
in
which
he
express
a
hope
that
they
two
may
for
the
future
live
together
on
friendly
term
,
forget
the
past
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
be
prepare
for
the
occasion
,
and
the
speech
be
poor
and
shamble
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
that
it
be
more
useful
than
it
may
have
be
,
have
it
be
utter
roundly
and
with
that
paternal
and
almost
majestic
effect
which
he
would
have
achieve
have
he
be
thoroughly
prepare
.
<EOS>
but
the
roundness
and
the
majesty
would
have
go
against
the
grain
with
his
son
,
and
there
would
have
be
a
danger
of
some
outbreak
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
Lord
Chiltern
smile
,
and
mutter
some
word
about
thing
be
"
all
right
,
"
and
then
make
his
way
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
great
deal
better
than
I
have
hope
,
"
he
say
to
himself
;
"
and
it
have
all
come
from
my
go
in
without
be
announce
.
"
<EOS>
but
there
be
still
a
fear
upon
him
that
his
father
even
yet
may
prepare
a
speech
,
and
speak
it
,
to
the
great
peril
of
their
mutual
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
His
meeting
with
Violet
be
of
course
pleasant
enough
.
<EOS>
now
that
she
have
succumb
,
and
have
tell
herself
and
have
tell
him
that
she
love
him
,
she
do
not
scruple
to
be
as
generous
as
a
maiden
should
be
who
have
acknowledge
herself
to
be
conquer
,
and
have
render
herself
to
the
conqueror
.
<EOS>
She
would
walk
with
him
and
ride
with
him
,
and
take
a
lively
interest
in
the
performance
of
all
his
horse
,
and
listen
to
hunting
story
as
long
as
he
choose
to
tell
them
.
<EOS>
in
all
this
,
she
be
so
good
and
so
loving
that
Lady
Laura
be
more
than
once
tempt
to
throw
in
her
tooth
her
old
,
often
-
repeat
assertion
,
that
she
be
not
prone
to
be
in
love
,
 
that
it
be
not
her
nature
to
feel
any
ardent
affection
for
a
man
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
she
would
probably
remain
unmarried
.
<EOS>
"
You
begrudge
me
my
little
bit
of
pleasure
,
"
Violet
say
,
in
answer
to
one
such
attack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
;
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
so
odd
to
see
you
,
of
all
woman
,
become
so
love
-
lorn
,
<EOS>
"
"
I
be
not
love
-
lorn
,
"
say
Violet
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
like
the
freedom
of
tell
him
everything
and
of
hear
everything
from
him
,
and
of
have
him
for
my
own
good
friend
.
<EOS>
He
may
go
away
for
twelve
month
,
and
I
should
not
be
unhappy
,
believe
,
as
I
do
,
that
he
would
be
true
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
all
of
which
set
Lady
Laura
think
whether
her
friend
have
not
be
wise
than
she
have
be
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
know
anything
of
that
sort
of
friendship
with
her
husband
which
already
seem
to
be
quite
establish
between
these
two
.
  
<EOS>
in
her
misery
one
day
Lady
Laura
tell
the
whole
story
of
her
own
unhappiness
to
her
brother
,
say
nothing
of
Phineas
Finn
,
 
think
nothing
of
him
as
she
tell
her
story
,
but
speak
more
strongly
perhaps
than
she
should
have
do
,
of
the
terrible
dreariness
of
her
life
at
Loughlinter
,
and
of
her
inability
to
induce
her
husband
to
alter
it
for
her
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
that
he
,
 
ill
-
treat
you
?
"
say
the
brother
,
with
a
scowl
on
his
face
which
seem
to
indicate
that
he
would
like
no
task
better
than
that
of
resent
such
ill
-
treatment
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
beat
me
,
if
you
mean
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
cruel
to
you
?
<EOS>
do
he
use
harsh
language
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
never
say
a
word
in
his
life
either
to
me
or
,
as
I
believe
,
to
any
other
human
being
,
that
he
would
think
himself
bind
to
regret

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
simply
choose
to
have
his
own
way
,
and
his
way
can
not
be
my
way
.
<EOS>
He
be
hard
,
and
dry
,
and
just
,
and
dispassionate
,

he
wish
me
to
be
the
same

that
be
all

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
fairly

Laura
,
as
far
as
I
be
concern

I
never
could

antipathetic

if
I
be

to
leave

can
I
make
the

so

stick
by

you
think
well
of
it

I
will
go
off
to
Loughlinter
to

morrow

and
tell
him
that
you
will
never

to
him

and
if
you
be
not
safe
from
him
here
at
Saulsby

you
shall
go
abroad
with
us

I
be
sure
Violet
would
not
object
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
cruel
to
you

"
  
<EOS>
but
in
truth
neither
of
Lady
Laura
's
councillor
be
able
to
give
her
advice
that
could
serve
her
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
could
not
leave
her
husband
without
other
cause
than
now
exist
,
although
she
feel
,
also
,
that
to
go
back
to
him
be
to
go
back
to
utter
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
and
when
she
see
Violet
and
her
brother
together
there
come
to
her
dream
of
what
may
have
be
her
own
happiness
<EOS>
have
she
keep
herself
free
from
those
terrible
bond
in
which
she
be
now
hold
a
prisoner

<EOS>
She
could
not
get
out
of
her
heart
the
remembrance
of
that
young
man
who
would
have
be
her
lover

if
she
would
have
let
him
,
 
of
whose
love
for
herself
she
have
be
aware
before
she
have
hand
herself
over
as
a
bale
of
good
to
her
unloved
,
unloving
husband
.
<EOS>
She
have
marry
Mr.
Kennedy
because
she
be
afraid
that
otherwise
she
may
find
herself
force
to
own
that
she
love
that
other
man
who
be
then
a
nobody
;
 
almost
nobody
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
Mr.
Kennedy
's
money
that
have
buy
her
.
<EOS>
this
woman
in
regard
to
money
have
show
herself
to
be
as
generous
as
the
sun

<EOS>
but
in
marry
Mr.

she
have
maintain
herself
in
her
high
position

among
the
first
of
her
own
people
,
 
among
the
first
socially

among
the
first
politically

<EOS>
but
have
she
marry
Phineas
,
 
have
she
become
Lady
Laura
Finn
<EOS>
,
 
there
would
have
be
a
great
descent
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
entertain
the
lead
man
of
her
party
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
be
on
a
level
with
the
wife
and
daughter
of
Cabinet
Ministers
.
<EOS>
She
may
,
indeed
,
have
remain
unmarried
!
<EOS>
but
she
know
that
have
she
do
so
,
 
have
she
so
resolve
,
 
that
which
she
call
her
fancy
would
have
be
too
strong
for
her

<EOS>
She
would
not

at

fate

you
will
go
up

London

I
suppose
so

I
must
do
as
he
tell
me

course

what
I

I
will
try
it

I

I

know
how

<EOS>
never
be
a
tyrant

Oswald

at

not
a

tyrant

remember
this

there
be
no
tyranny
to
a

like
tell
her

<EOS>
talk

beat

<EOS>
beating

"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
remain
ten
day
at
Saulsby
,
and
at
last
do
not
get
away
without
a
few
unpleasant
word
with
his
father
,
 
or
without
a
few
word
that
be
almost
unpleasant
with
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
on
his
first
arrival
he
have
tell
his
sister
that
he
should
go
on
a
certain
day
,
and
some
intimation
to
this
effect
have
probably
be
convey
to
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
but
when
his
son
tell
him
one
evening
that
the
post
-
chaise
have
be
order
for
seven
o'clock
the
next
morning
,
he
feel
that
his
son
be
ungracious
and
abrupt
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
thing
still
to
be
say
,
and
indeed
there
have
be
no
speech
of
any
account
make
at
all
as
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
sudden
,
"
say
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Laura
have
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
not
tell
me
a
word
lately
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
say
something
before
you
come
here
.
<EOS>
what
be
there
to
hurry
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
ten
day
would
be
as
long
as
you
would
care
to
have
me
here
,
and
as
I
say
that
I
would
be
back
by
the
first
,
I
would
rather
not
change
my
plan
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
to
hunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
shall
hunt
till
the
end
of
March
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
may
have
hunt
here
,
Oswald
.
<EOS>
"
but
the
son
make
no
sign
of
change
his
plan
;
and
the
father
,
see
that
he
would
not
change
them
,
become
solemn
and
severe
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
few
word
which
he
must
say
to
his
son
,
 
something
of
a
speech
that
he
must
make
;
 
so
he
lead
the
way
into
the
room
with
the
dark
book
and
the
dark
furniture
,
and
point
to
a
great
deep
arm
-
chair
for
his
son
's
accommodation
.
<EOS>
but
as
he
do
not
sit
down
himself
,
neither
do
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
understand
very
well
how
great
be
the
advantage
of
a
stand
orator
over
a
sit
recipient
of
his
oratory
,
and
that
advantage
he
would
not
give
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
hope
to
have
an
opportunity
of
say
a
few
word
to
you
about
the
future

the
Earl

<EOS>
"
I
think
we
shall
be
marry
in
July
,

say
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
have
hear
;
 
but
after
that
.
<EOS>
now
I
do
not
want
to
interfere
,
Oswald
,
and
of
course
the
less
so
,
because
Violet
's
money
will
to
a
great
degree
restore
the
inroad
which
have
be
make
upon
the
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
more
than
restore
them
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
if
her
estate
be
settle
on
a
second
son
,
Oswald

I
hear
from
Lady
Baldock
that
that
be
the
wish

She

what

I
do

<EOS>
I
have
not
even
ask
about
it

<EOS>
She
ask
me
,
and
I
tell
her
to
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
should
wish
it
to
go
with
the

<EOS>
of

that
would
be
good

She

it
be
not
about

Oswald

that
I

what

Lord

laugh

do

pleasantly

I
have
always
work

those

you
should
care

you

<EOS>
It
be
your
duty
to
do
so

My
wish

Parliament

I
can

why
not

"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
first
place
,
sir
,
you
have
not
get
a
seat
to
offer
me

<EOS>
You
have
manage
matter
among
you
in
such
a
way
that
poor
little
Loughton
have
be
swallow
up

<EOS>
if
I
be
to
canvass
the
elector

I
do
not

many
would
look
very

the
county

Oswald

whom
be
I
to
turn
out

<EOS>
I
should
spend
four
or
five
thousand
pound
,
and
have
nothing
but
vexation
in
return
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
rather
not
begin
that
game
,
and
indeed
I
be
too
old
for
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
take
it
up
early
enough
to
believe
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
all
this
make
the
Earl
very
angry
,
and
from
these
thing
they
go
on
to
bad
thing
.
<EOS>
when
question
again
as
to
the
future
,
Lord
Chiltern
scowl
,
and
at
last
declare
that
it
be
his
idea
to
live
abroad
in
the
summer
for
his
wife
's
recreation
,
and
somewhere
down
in
the
shire
during
the
winter
for
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
would
admit
of
no
purpose
high
than
recreation
,
and
when
his
father
again
talk
to
him
of
a
nobleman
's
duty
,
he
say
that
he
know
of
no
other
special
duty
than
that
of
not
exceed
his
income
.
<EOS>
then
his
father
make
a
long
speech
than
before
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
Lord
Chiltern
simply
wish
him
good
night
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
get
late
,
and
I
have
promise
to
see
Violet
before
I
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
be
off
,
and
Lord
Brentford
be
leave
there
,
stand
with
his
back
to
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
Lord
Chiltern
have
a
discussion
with
Violet
,
which
last
nearly
half
the
night
;
and
during
the
discussion
she
tell
him
more
than
once
that
he
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
as
I
be
you
must
take
me
,
or
leave
me
,
"
he
say
,
in
anger
.
"
<EOS>
nay
;
there
be
no
choice
now
,
"
she
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
take
you
,
and
I
will
stick
by
you
,
 
whether
you
be
right
or
wrong
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
think
you
wrong
,
I
shall
say
so
.
"
<EOS>
He
swear
to
her
as
he
press
her
to
his
heart
that
she
be
the
fine
,
grand
,
sweetest
woman
that
ever
the
world
have
produce
.
<EOS>
but
still
there
be
present
on
his
palate
,
when
he
leave
her
,
the
bitter
taste
of
her
reprimand
.
   
<EOS>
what
the
People
in
Marylebone
think
 
Phineas
Finn
,
when
the
session
begin
,
be
still
hard
at
work
upon
his
Canada
bill
,
and
in
his
work
find
some
relief
for
his
break
back
.
<EOS>
He
go
into
the
matter
with
all
his
energy
,
and
before
the
debate
come
on
,
know
much
more
about
the
seven
thousand
inhabitant
of
some
hundred
of
thousand
of
square
mile
at
the
back
of
Canada
,
than
he
do
of
the
people
of
London
or
of
County
Clare
.
<EOS>
and
he
find
some
consolation
also
in
the
good
-
nature
of
Madame
Goesler
,
whose
drawing
-
room
be
always
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
talk
freely
now
to
Madame
Goesler
about
Violet
,
and
have
even
venture
to
tell
her
that
once
,
in
old
day
,
he
have
think
of
love
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
speak
of
those
day
as
be
very
old
;
and
then
he
perhaps
say
some
word
to
her
about
dear
little
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
there
be
not
much
in
his
career
of
which
he
do
not
say
something
to
Madame
Goesler
,
and
that
he
receive
from
her
a
good
deal
of
excellent
advice
and
encouragement
in
the
direction
of
his
political
ambition
.
<EOS>
"
a
man
should
work
,
"
she
say
,
 
"
and
you
do
work
.
<EOS>
a
woman
can
only
look
on
,
and
admire
and
long
.
<EOS>
what
be
there
that
I
can
do
?
<EOS>
I
can
learn
to
care
for
these
Canadians
,
just
because
you
care
for
them
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
the
beaver
that
you
tell
me
of
,
I
should
have
to
care
for
the
beaver
.
"
<EOS>
then
Phineas
of
course
tell
her
that
such
sympathy
from
her
be
all
and
all
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
reader
must
not
on
this
account
suppose
that
he
be
untrue
in
his
love
to
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
His
back
be
altogether
break
by
his
fall
,
and
he
be
quite
aware
that
such
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
not
as
yet
,
at
least
,
have
come
to
him
any
remote
idea
that
a
cure
be
possible
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
March
he
hear
that
Lady
Laura
be
up
in
town
,
and
of
course
he
be
bind
to
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
information
be
give
to
him
by
Mr.
Kennedy
himself
,
who
tell
him
that
he
have
be
to
Scotland
to
fetch
her
.
<EOS>
in
these
day
there
be
an
acknowledge
friendship
between
these
two
,
but
there
be
no
intimacy
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mr.
Kennedy
be
a
man
who
be
hardly
intimate
with
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
with
Phineas
<EOS>
he
now
and
then
exchange
a
few
word
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
,
and
when
they
chance
to
meet
each
other
,
they
meet
as
friend
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
have
no
strong
wish
to
see
again
in
his
house
the
man
respect
whom
he
have
venture
to
caution
his
wife
;
but
he
be
thoughtful
;
and
think
over
it
all
,
he
find
it
well
to
ask
him
there
.
<EOS>
no
one
must
know
that
there
be
any
reason
why
Phineas
should
not
come
to
his
house
;
especially
as
all
the
world
know
that
Phineas
have
protect
him
from
the
garrotter
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
be
in
town
now
,
"
he
say
;
"
you
must
go
and
see
her
before
long
.
<EOS>
"
phineas
of
course
promise
that
he
would
go
.
  
<EOS>
in
these
day
Phineas
be
begin
to
be
aware
that
he
have
enemy
,
 
though
he
could
not
understand
why
anybody
should
be
his
enemy
now
that
Violet
Effingham
have
decide
against
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
poor
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
indeed
,
whom
he
have
supersede
at
the
Colonial
Office
,
but
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
to
give
merit
where
merit
be
due
,
feel
no
animosity
against
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
welcome
,
me
boy
;
you
be
welcome
,
 
as
far
as
yourself
go
.
<EOS>
but
as
for
the
party
,
bedad
,
it
be
rotten
to
the
core
,
and
will
not
stand
another
session
.
<EOS>
mind
,
it
be
I
who
tell
you
so
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
poor
idle
Irishman
,
in
so
speak
,
speak
the
truth
as
well
as
he
know
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
Ratlers
and
the
Bonteens
be
Finn
's
bitter
foe
,
and
do
not
scruple
to
let
him
know
that
such
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
have
scruple
on
the
subject
,
and
in
a
certain
mildly
apologetic
way
still
speak
well
of
the
young
man
,
whom
he
have
himself
first
introduce
into
political
life
only
four
year
since
;
 
but
there
be
no
earnestness
or
cordiality
in
Barrington
Erle
's
manner
,
and
Phineas
know
that
his
first
staunch
friend
could
no
longer
be
regard
as
a
pillar
of
support
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
set
of
man
,
quite
as
influential
,
 
<EOS>
so
Phineas
think
,
 
as
the
busy
politician
of
the
club
,
who
be
very
friendly
to
him
.
<EOS>
these
be
man
,
generally
of
high
position
,
of
steady
character
,
 
hard
worker
,
 
who
think
quite
as
much
of
what
a
man
do
in
his
office
as
what
he
say
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
Lords
Cantrip
,
Thrift
,
and
Fawn
be
of
this
class
,
 
and
they
be
all
very
courteous
to
Phineas
.
<EOS>
envious
man
begin
to
say
of
him
that
he
care
little
now
for
any
one
of
the
party
who
have
not
a
handle
to
his
name
,
and
that
he
prefer
to
live
with
lord
and
lordling
.
<EOS>
this
be
hard
upon
him
,
as
the
great
political
ambition
of
his
life
be
to
call
Mr.
Monk
his
friend
;
and
he
would
sooner
have
act
with
Mr.
Monk
than
with
any
other
man
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
but
though
Mr.
Monk
have
not
desert
him
,
there
have
come
to
be
little
of
late
in
common
between
the
two
.
<EOS>
His
life
be
become
that
of
a
parliamentary
official
rather
than
that
of
a
politician
;
 
<EOS>
whereas
,
though
Mr.
Monk
be
in
office
,
his
public
life
be
purely
political
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
have
great
idea
of
his
own
which
he
intend
to
hold
,
whether
by
hold
them
he
may
remain
in
office
or
be
force
out
of
office
;
and
he
be
indifferent
as
to
the
direction
which
thing
in
this
respect
may
take
with
him
.
<EOS>
but
Phineas
,
who
have
achieve
his
declared
object
in
get
into
place
,
feel
that
he
be
almost
constrain
to
adopt
the
view
of
other
,
let
them
be
what
they
may
.
<EOS>
man
speak
to
him
,
as
though
his
parliamentary
career
be
wholly
at
the
disposal
of
the
Government
,
 
as
though
he
be
like
a
proxy
in
Mr.
Gresham
's
pocket
,
 
with
this
difference
,
<EOS>
that
when
direct
to
get
up
and
speak
on
a
subject
he
be
bind
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
this
annoy
him
,
and
he
complain
to
Mr.
Monk
;
but
Mr.
Monk
only
shrug
his
shoulder
and
tell
him
that
he
must
make
his
choice
.
<EOS>
He
soon
discover
Mr.
Monk
's
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
choose
to
make
Parliament
a
profession
,
 
as
you
have
choose
,
 
you
can
have
no
right
even
to
think
of
independence
.
<EOS>
if
the
country
find
you
out
when
you
be
in
Parliament
,
and
then
invite
you
to
office
,
of
course
the
thing
be
different
.
<EOS>
but
the
latter
be
a
slow
career
,
and
probably
would
not
have
suit
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
be
the
meaning
of
what
Mr.
Monk
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
these
official
and
parliamentary
honour
be
great
when
see
at
a
distance
than
he
find
them
to
be
now
that
he
possess
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
work
ten
hour
a
day
,
and
could
rarely
call
a

his
own

but
,
after
all
,
with
all
this
work
,
Mr.
Low
be
less
of
a
slave
,
and
more
independent
,
than

Phineas
Finn

Under

Secretary
of
State
,
the
friend
of
Cabinet
Ministers
,
and
Member
of
Parliament
since
his
twenty
-
fifth
year
!
<EOS>
He
begin
to
dislike
the
House
,
and
to
think
it
a
bore
to
sit
on
the
Treasury
bench
;
 
he
,
who
a
few
year
since
have
regard
Parliament
as
the
British
heaven
on
earth
,
and
who
,
since
he
have
be
in
Parliament
,
have
look
at
that
bench
with
long
envious
eye
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
who
seem
to
have
as
much
to
eat
and
drink
as
ever
,
and
a
bed
also
to
lie
on
,
could
come
and
go
in
the
House
as
he
please
,
since
his
 
resignation
.
  
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
new
trouble
come
.
<EOS>
the
Reform
Bill
for
England
have
pass
;
but
now
there
be
to
be
another
Reform
Bill
for
Ireland
.
<EOS>
let
them
pass
what
bill
they
may
,
this
would
not
render
necessary
a
new
irish
election
till
the
entire
House
should
be
dissolve
.
<EOS>
but
he
fear
that
he
would
be
call
upon
to
vote
for
the
abolition
of
his
own
borough
,
 
and
for
other
point
almost
equally
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
would
not
be
consult
,
 
but
would
be
call
upon
to
vote
,
and
perhaps
to
speak
;
and
be
certain
that
if
he
do
so
,
there
would
be
war
between
him
and
his
constituent
.
<EOS>
Lord
Tulla
have
already
communicate
to
him
his
idea
that
,
for
certain
excellent
reason
,
Loughshane
ought
to
be
spare
.
<EOS>
but
this
evil
be
,
he
hope
,
a
distant
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
generally
think
that
,
as
the
English
Reform
Bill
have
be
pass
last
year
,
and
as
the
irish
bill
,
if
carry
,
could
not
be
immediately
operative
,
the
doing
of
the
thing
may
probably
be
postpone
to
the
next
session
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
first
see
Lady
Laura
he
be
strike
by
the
great
change
in
her
look
and
manner
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
him
to
be
old
and
worn
,
and
he
judge
her
to
be
wretched
,
 
as
she
be
.
<EOS>
She
have
write
to
him
to
say
that
she
would
be
at
her
father
's
house
on
such
and
such
a
morning
,
and
he
have
go
to
her
there
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
of
no
use
your
coming
to
Grosvenor
Place
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
nobody
there
,
and
the
house
be
like
a
prison
.
"
<EOS>
later
in
the
interview
she
tell
him
not
to
come
and
dine
there
,
even
though
Mr.
Kennedy
should
ask
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
not
?
"
he
demand
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
everything
would
be
stiff
,
and
cold
,
and
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
do
not
wish
to
make
your
way
into
a
lady
's
house
if
she
ask
you
not
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
sort
of
smile
on
her
face
as
she
say
this
,
but
he
could
perceive
that
it
be
a
very
bitter
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
easily
excuse
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
can
excuse
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
do
so
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
particularly
anxious
to
dine
with
Mr.
Kennedy
,
you
can
easily
do
so
at
your
club
.
<EOS>
"
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
and
the
word
she
use
,
she
hardly
attempt
to
conceal
her
dislike
of
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
tell
me
about
Miss
Effingham
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
for
me
to
tell

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
there
be

much
to
tell

<EOS>
You
need
not
spare
me

<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
deny
to
you
that
I
have
be
hit
hard
,
 
so
hard
,
that
I
have
be
nearly
knock
down

it
will
not
hurt
me
now
to
hear
of
it
all

do
she
always
love
him
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not

<EOS>
I
think
she
do
after
her
own
fashion

<EOS>
"
I
sometimes
think
woman
would
be
less
cruel

he
say
,

know
how
great
be
the
anguish
they
can
cause

have
she
be
cruel
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
complain
of

if
she
love
Chiltern
,
why
do
she
not
tell
him
so
at
once
?
<EOS>
and
why
 
"
  
"
this
be
complain
,
Mr.
Finn

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not

I
would
not

I

help
it

be
they
to
be
marry
soon

<EOS>

in
July

so
they
now
say

where

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
no

can
tell

<EOS>
I
do
not

that

if

Oswald

with

there
be
a
pause
for
a
moment
,
and
then
Lady
Laura
answer
him
with
a
touch
of
scorn
in
her
voice
,
 
and
with
some
scorn
,
too
,
in
her
eye
:
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
,
Mr.

the
season
will
not
be
over

there
be
some
one
else

"
  
<EOS>
"
there
you
wrong
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
They
tell

<EOS>
"
Madame
Goesler
!

what
matter
who
it
be
as
long
as
she
be
young
and
pretty
,
and
have
the
interest
attach
to
her
of
something
more
than
ordinary
position
?
<EOS>
when
man
tell
me
of
the
cruelty
of
woman
,
I
think
that
no
woman
can
be
really
cruel
because
no
man
be
capable
of
suffer

<EOS>
a
woman
,
if
she
be
throw
aside
,
do
suffer

do
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
then
,
that
I
be
indifferent
to
Miss
Effingham

"
when
he
thus
speak
,
I
wonder
whether
he
have
forget
that
he
have
ever
declare
to
this
very
woman
to
whom
he
be
speak

a
passion
for
herself

Psha

<EOS>

suit
you

Lady

to
be
harsh
to

you
be
not
speak
your

"
  
<EOS>
then
she
lose
all
control
of
herself
,

pour
out
to
him
the
real
truth
that
be
in
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
whose
thought
do
you
speak
when
you
and
I
be
on
the
brae
of
Loughlinter
?
<EOS>
be
I
wrong
in
say
that
change
be
easy
to
you
,
or
have
I
grow
to
be
so
old
that
you
can
talk
to
me
as

those
far
-
away
folly
ought
to

<EOS>
be
it
so
long

talk

may
be
a
dozen
violet
after

you
will
be
none

<EOS>
then
she
walk
away
from
him
to
the
window
,
and
he
stand
still
,
dumb
,
on
the
spot
that
he
have
occupy
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
go
now

"
she

have
pass
between

I
know
that
you
be
a
gentleman

that
you
will
forget
it

<EOS>
"
the
strong
idea
of
his
mind
when
he
hear
all
this
be
the
injustice
of
her
attack
,
 
of
the
attack
as
come
from
her
,
who
have
all
but
openly
acknowledge
that
she
have
marry
a
man
whom
she
have
not
love
because
it
suit
her
to
escape
from
a
man
whom
she
do
love

<EOS>
She
be
reproach
him
now
for
his
fickleness
in
have
venture
to
set
his
heart
upon
another
woman
,
when
she
herself
have
be
so
much
bad
than
fickle
,
 
so
profoundly
false
!
<EOS>
and
yet
he
could
not
defend
himself
by
accuse
her
.
<EOS>
what
would
she
have
have
of
him
?
<EOS>
what
would
she
have
propose
to
him
,
have
he
question
her
as
to
his
future
,
when
they
be
together
on
the
brae
of
Loughlinter

<EOS>
Would
she
not
have
bid
him
to
find
some
one
else
whom
he
could
love
?
<EOS>
Would
she
then
have
suggest
to
him
the
propriety
of
nurse
his
love
for
herself
,
 
for
her
who
be
about
to
become
another
man
's
wife
,
 
for
her
after
she
should
have
become
another
man
's
wife

<EOS>
and
yet
because
he
have
not
do
so
,
and
because
she
have
make
herself
wretched
by
marry
a
man
whom
she
do
not
love
,
she
reproach
him
!
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
tell
her
of
all
this
,
so
he
fall
back
for
his
defence
on
word
which
have
pass
between
them
since
the
day
when
they
have
meet
on
the

<EOS>
You
can
not
but
feel
that
when
I
hear
your
wailing
,
I
must
be
impatient
.
<EOS>
You
have
better
leave
me
now
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
be
we
to
be
no
long
friend
?
"
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
far
as
friendship
can
go
without
intercourse
,
I
shall
always
be
your
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
he
go
,
and
as
he
walk
down
to
his
office
,
<EOS>
so
intent
be
he
on
that
which
have
just
pass
that
he
hardly
see
the
people
as
he
meet
them
,
or
be
aware
of
the
street
through
which
his
way
lead
him
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
something
in
the
later
word
which
Lady
Laura
have
speak
that
have
make
him
feel
almost
unconsciously
that
the
injustice
of
her
reproach
be
not
so
great
as
he
have
at
first
feel
it
to
be
,
and
that
she
have
some
cause
for
her
scorn
.
<EOS>
if
her
case
be
such
as
she
have
so
plainly
describe
it
,
what
be
his
plight
as
compare
with
hers
?
<EOS>
He
have
lose
his
violet
,
and
be
in
pain
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
much
of
suffer
before
him
.
<EOS>
but
though
Violet
be
lose
,
the
world
be
not
all
blank
before
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
tell
himself
,
even
in
his
dreary
moment
,
that
there
be
before
him
"
no
escape
,
no
hope
,
no
prospect
of
relief
,
no
place
of
consolation
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
begin
to
think
whether
this
must
in
truth
be
the
case
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
what
if
Mr.
Kennedy
be
to
die
?
<EOS>
what
in
such
case
as
that
would
he
do
?
<EOS>
in
ten
or
perhaps
in
five
year
time
may
it
not
be
possible
for
him
to
go
through
the
ceremony
of
fall
upon
his
knee
,
with
stiffened
joint
indeed
,
but
still
with
something
leave
of
the
ardour
of
his
old
love
,
of
his
old
love
of
all
?
  
<EOS>
as
he
be
think
of
this
he
be
bring
up
short
in
his
walk
as
he
be
enter
the
Green
Park
beneath
the
Duke
's
figure
,
by
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
not
be
in
your
office
at
such
an
hour
as
this
,
Finn

me
boy

,
at

,
not

the

I

<EOS>
I
have

on
a

Marylebone

to
find
what
the
people
there
think
about
the
Canadas

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
they

about
the
Canadas
in
Marylebone

<EOS>
"
  
"
not
one
man
in
a
thousand

whether
the
Canadians
prosper
or
fail
to
prosper

<EOS>
They
care
that
Canada
should
not
go
to
the
States
,
because
,
 
though
they
do
not
love
the
Canadians
,
they
do
hate
the
Americans

<EOS>
that
be
about
the
feeling
in
Marylebone

it
be
astonishing
how
like
the
Maryleboners
be
to
the

<EOS>

what
a

"
never
mind
who

they
tell

be
true

<EOS>
take
an
old
friend
's
advice
,
and
strike
while
the
iron
's
hot
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
do
not
believe
what
he
have
hear
,
but
though
he
do
not
believe
it
,
still
the
tiding
set
his
heart
beat
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
believe
it
less
perhaps
have
he
know
that
Laurence
have
just
receive
the
news
from
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
   
<EOS>
the
Top
Brick
of
the
Chimney
 
Madame
Max
Goesler
be
a
lady
who
know
that
in
fight
the
battle
which
fall
to
her
lot
,
in
arrange
the
social
difficulty
which
she
find
in
her
way
,
in
do
the
work
of
the
world
which
come
to
her
share
,
very
much
more
care
be
necessary
,
 
and
care
too
about
thing
apparently
trifle
,
 
than
be
demand
by
the
affair
of
people
in
general
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
not
the
case
so
much
on
account
of
any
special
disadvantage
under
which
she
labour
,
as
because
she
be
ambitious
of
do
the
very
uttermost
with
those
advantage
which
she
possess
.
<EOS>
Her
own
birth
have
not
be
high
,
and
that
of
her
husband
,
we
may
perhaps
say
,
have
be
very
low
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
old
when
she
have
marry
him
,
and
she
have
have
little
power
of
make
any
progress
till
he
have
leave
her
a
widow
.
<EOS>
then
she
find
herself
possess
of
money
,
certainly
;
of
wit
,
 
as
she
believe
;
and
of
a
something
in
her
personal
appearance
which
,
as
she
plainly
tell
herself
,
she
may
perhaps
palm
off
upon
the
world
as
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
who
do
not
flatter
herself
,
who
do
not
strongly
believe
in
herself
,
who
could
even
bring
herself
to
wonder
that
man
and
woman
in
high
position
should
condescend
to
notice
such
a
one
as
her
.
<EOS>
with
all
her
ambition
,
there
be
a
something
of
genuine
humility
about
her
;
and
with
all
the
hardness
she
have
learn
there
be
a
touch
of
womanly
softness
which
would
sometimes
obtrude
itself
upon
her
heart
.
<EOS>
when
she
find
a
woman
really
kind
to
her
,
she
would
be
very
kind
in
return
.
<EOS>
and
though
she
prize
wealth
,
and
know
that
her
money
be
her
only
rock
of
strength
,
she
could
be
lavish
with
it
,
as
though
it
be
dirt
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
highly
ambitious
,
and
she
play
her
game
with
great
skill
and
great
caution
.
<EOS>
Her
door
be
not
open
to
all
caller
;
 
be
shut
even
to
some
who
find
but
few
door
close
against
them
;
 
be
shut
occasionally
to
those
whom
she
most
specially
wish
to
see
within
them
.
<EOS>
She
know
how
to
allure
by
deny
,
and
to
make
the
gift
rich
by
delay
it
.
<EOS>
We
be
tell
by
the
latin
proverb
that
he
who
give
quickly
give
twice
;
but
I
say
that
she
who
give
quickly
seldom
give
more
than
half
.
<EOS>
when
in
the
early
spring
the
Duke
of
Omnium
first
knock
at
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
door
,
he
be
inform
that
she
be
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
feel
very
cross
as
he
hand
his
card
out
from
his
dark
green
brougham
,
 
on
the
panel
of
which
there
be
no
blazon
to
tell
the
owner
's
rank
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
cross
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
him
that
she
be
always
at
home
between
four
and
six
on
a
Thursday
.
<EOS>
He
have
condescend
to
remember
the
information
,
and
have
act
upon
it
,
 
and
now
she
be
not
at
home
!
<EOS>
She
be
not
at
home
,
though
he
have
come
on
a
Thursday
at
the
very
hour
she
have
name
to
him
.
<EOS>
any
duke
would
have
be
cross
,
but
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
particularly
cross
.
<EOS>
no
;
 
he
certainly
would
give
himself
no
further
trouble
by
go
to
the
cottage
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
and
yet
Madame
Max
Goesler
have
be
in
her
own
drawing
-
room
,
while
the
Duke
be
hand
out
his
card
from
the
brougham
below
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
there
come
to
him
a
note
from
the
cottage
,
 
such
a
pretty
note
!
 
<EOS>
so
penitent
,
so
full
of
remorse
,
 
and
,
which
be
well
still
,
so
laden
with
disappointment
,
that
he
forgive
her
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
duke
,
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
to
apologise
to
you
,
after
have
tell
you
that
I
be
always
at
home
on
Thursdays
;
and
I
be
at
home
yesterday
when
you
call
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
unwell
,
and
I
have
tell
the
servant
to
deny
me
,
not
think
how
much
I
may
be
lose
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
indeed
,
I
would
not
have
give
way
to
a
silly
headache
,
<EOS>
have
I
think
that
your
grace
would
have
be
here
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
now
I
must
not
even
hope
for
the
photograph
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
penitently
,
  
MARIE
M.
G.
  
<EOS>
the
note
-
paper
be
very
pretty
note
-
paper
,
hardly
scent
,
and
yet
convey
a
sense
of
something
sweet
,
and
the
monogram
be
small
and
new
,
and
fantastic
without
be
grotesque
,
and
the
writing
be
of
that
sort
which
the
Duke
,
have
much
experience
,
have
learn
to
like
,
 
and
there
be
something
in
the
signature
which
please
him
.
<EOS>
so
he
write
a
reply
,
    
DEAR
MADAME
MAX
GOESLER
,
  
I
will
call
again
next
Thursday
,
or
,
<EOS>
if
prevent
,
will
let
you
know
.
  
<EOS>
yours
faithfully
,
  
O.
  
<EOS>
when
the
green
brougham
draw
up
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
on
the
next
Thursday
,
Madame
Goesler
be
at
home
,
and
have
no
headache
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
not
at
all
penitent
now
.
<EOS>
She
have
probably
study
the
subject
,
and
have
resolve
that
penitence
be
more
alluring
in
a
letter
than
when
act
in
person
.
<EOS>
She
receive
her
guest
with
perfect
ease
,
and
apologise
for
the
injury
do
to
him
in
the
precede
week
,
with
much
self
-
complacency
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
sorry
when
I
get
your
card
,
"
she
say
;
"
and
yet
I
be
so
glad
now
that
you
be
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
ill
,
"
say
the
Duke
,
"
it
be
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
horribly
ill
,
to
tell
the
truth
;
 
as
pale
as
a
death
's
head
,
and
without
a
word
to
say
for
myself
.
<EOS>
I
be
fit
to
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
of
course
you
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
flash
upon
me
immediately
that
I
have
name
a
day
,
and
that
you
have
be
kind
enough
to
remember
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
think
you
come
to
London
till
the
March
wind
be
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
March
wind
blow
everywhere
in
this
wretched
island
,
Madame
Goesler
,
and
there
be
no
escape
them
.
<EOS>
youth
may
prevail
against
them
;
but
on
me
they
be
so
potent
that
I
think
they
will
succeed
in
drive
me
out
of
my
country
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
an
old
man
should
ever
live
in
England
if
he
can
help
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
certainly
be
an
old
man
,
if
a
man
turn
of
seventy
be
old
;
 
and
he
be
a
man
too
who
do
not
bear
his
year
with
hearty
strength
.
<EOS>
He
move
slowly
,
and
turn
his
limb
,
when
he
do
turn
them
,
as
though
the
joint
be
stiff
in
their
socket
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
nevertheless
about
him
a
dignity
of
demeanour
,
a
majesty
of
person
,
and
an
upright
carriage
which
do
not
leave
an
idea
of
old
age
as
the
first
impress
on
the
mind
of
those
who
encounter
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
He
be
tall
and
move
without
a
stoop
;
and
though
he
move
slowly
,
he
have
learn
to
seem
so
to
do
because
it
be
the
proper
kind
of
movement
for
one
so
high
up
in
the
world
as
himself
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
his
tailor
do
something
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
long
under
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
eye
before
she
perceive
that
his
tailor
have
do
a
good
deal
for
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
allude
to
his
own
age
and
to
her
youth
,
she
say
some
pleasant
little
word
as
to
the
difference
between
oak
-
tree
and
currant
-
bush
;
and
by
that
time
she
be
seat
comfortably
on
her
sofa
,
and
the
Duke
be
on
a
chair
before
her
,
 
just
as
may
have
be
any
man
who
be
not
a
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
little
time
the
photograph
be
bring
forth
from
his
grace
's
pocket
.
<EOS>
that
bring
out
and
give
of
photograph
,
with
the
demand
for
counter
photograph
,
be
the
most
absurd
practice
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
look
very
nice
,
do
I
?
"
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
 
very
nice
,
but
a
little
too
old
;
and
certainly
you
have
not
get
those
spot
all
over
your
forehead
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
remark
which
on
such
occasion
be
the
most
common
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
say
that
to
give
a
photograph
or
to
take
a
photograph
without
the
utterance
of
some
word
which
would
be
feel
by
a
bystander
to
be
absurd
,
be
almost
an
impossibility
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
there
be
no
bystander
,
and
therefore
the
Duke
and
the
lady
have
no
need
for
caution
.
<EOS>
word
be
speak
that
be
very
absurd
.
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
protest
that
the
Duke
's
photograph
be
more
to
her
than
the
photograph
of
all
the
world
beside
;
and
the
Duke
declare
that
he
would
carry
the
lady
's
picture
next
to
his
heart
,
 
I
be
afraid
he
say
for
ever
and
ever
.
<EOS>
then
he
take
her
hand
and
press
it
,
and
be
conscious
that
for
a
man
over
seventy
year
of
age
he
do
that
kind
of
thing
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
and
dine
with
me
,
Duke
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
when
he
begin
to
talk
of
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
dine
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
the
reason
you
should
dine
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
shall
meet
nobody
you
do
not
wish
to
meet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
so
much
rather
see
you
in
this
way
,
 
I
would
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
do
dine
out
occasionally
,
but
it
be
at
big
formal
party
,
which
I
can
not
escape
without
give
offence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
can
not
escape
my
little
not
formal
party
,
 
without
give
offence
.
<EOS>
"
She
look
into
his
face
as
she
speak
,
and
he
know
that
she
mean
it
.
<EOS>
and
he
look
into
her
,
and
think
that
her
eye
be
bright
than
any
he
be
in
the
habit
of

<EOS>
"
as
she
speak
her
eye
sparkle
more
and
more
,
and
her
colour
go
and
come
,
and
she
shake
her
curl
till
they
emit
through
the
air
the
same
soft
feeling
of
a
perfume
that
her
note
have
produce
.
<EOS>
then
her
foot
peep
out
from
beneath
the
black
and
yellow
drapery
of
her
dress
,
and
the
Duke
see
that
it
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
and
she
put
out
her
finger
and
touch
his
arm
as
she
speak
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
be
very
fair
,
and
her
finger
be
bright
with
rich
gem
.
<EOS>
to
man
such
as
the
Duke
,
a
hand
,
to
be
quite
fair
,
should
be
bright
with
rich
gem
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
come
,
"
she
say
,
 
not
implore
him
now
but
command
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
come
,
"
he
answer
,
and
a
certain
Sunday
be
fix
.
  
<EOS>
the
arranging
of
the
guest
be
a
little
difficulty
,
till
Madame
Goesler
beg
the
Duke
to
bring
with
him
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
,
his
nephew
's
wife
.
<EOS>
this
at
last
he
agree
to
do
.
<EOS>
as
the
wife
of
his
nephew
and
heir
,
Lady
Glencora
be
to
the
Duke
all
that
a
woman
could
be
.
<EOS>
She
be
everything
that
be
proper
as
to
her
own
conduct
,
and
not
obtrusive
as
to
his
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
bore
him
,
and
yet
she
be
attentive
.
<EOS>
although
in
her
husband
's
house
she
be
a
fierce
politician
,
in
his
house
she
be
simply
an
attractive
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
;
she
be
very
clever
,
"
the
Duke
once
say
,
"
she
adapt
herself
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
to
go
from
any
one
place
to
any
other
,
she
would
be
at
home
in
both
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
movement
of
his
Grace
's
hand
as
he
speak
seem
to
indicate
the
wide
possible
sphere
for
travel
and
the
wide
possible
scope
for
adaptation
.
<EOS>
the
dinner
be
arrange
,
and
go
off
very
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
's
eye
be
not
quite
so
bright
as
they
be
during
that
morning
visit
,
nor
do
she
touch
her
guest
's
arm
in
a
manner
so
alluring
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
quiet
,
allow
her
guest
to
do
most
of
the
talking
.
<EOS>
but
the
dinner
and
the
flower
and
the
wine
be
excellent
,
and
the
whole
thing
be
so
quiet
that
the
Duke
like
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
you
must
come
and
dine
with
me
,
"
the
Duke
say
as
he
take
his
leave
.
<EOS>
"
a
command
to
that
effect
will
be
one
which
I
certainly
shall
not
disobey
,
"
whisper
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
he
be
go
to
get
fond
of
that
woman
.
<EOS>
"
these
word
be
speak
early
on
the
following
morning
by
Lady
Glencora

her
husband
,
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
He

of
some
woman
,
and
he
will
to
the
end
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
this
Madame
Max
Goesler
be
very
clever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
they
tell
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
generally
think
that
my
uncle
like
talk
to
a
fool
the
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
every
man
like
a
clever
woman
the
good
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
"
if
the
clever
woman
only
know
how
to
use
her
cleverness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
hope
he
will
be
amuse
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
innocently
.
<EOS>
"
a
little
amusement
be
all
that
he
care
for
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
you
be
tell
some
day
that
he
be
go
 
to
be
marry
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle

!
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
he
as
well
as
another
?
"
  
"
and
to
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
ever
married
it
will
be
to
some
such
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
a
man
in
all
England
who
think
more
of
his
own
position
than
my
uncle
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
somewhat
proudly
,
 
almost
with
a
touch
of
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
,
Plantagenet
,
and
true
enough
in
a
kind
of
way
.
<EOS>
but
a
child
will
sacrifice
all
that
it
have
for
the
top
brick
of
the
chimney
,
and
old
man
sometimes
become
child
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
like
to
be
tell
some
morning
that
there
be
a
little
Lord
Silverbridge
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
now
the
eld
son
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
when
the
Duke
of
Omnium

a

the
Earl
of
Silverbridge
;
and
Mr.
Palliser
,
when
this
question
be

,
become
very
pale

<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
know
well
how
thoroughly
the
cunning
of
the
serpent
be
join
to
the
purity
of
the
dove
in
the
person
of
his
wife
,
and
he
be
sure
that
there
be
cause
for
fear
when
she
hint
at
danger
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
have
better
keep
your
eye
upon
him
,
"
he
say
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
upon
her
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
when
Madame
Goesler
dine
at
the
Duke
's
house
in
St.
James
's
Square
there
be
a
large
party
,
and
Lady
Glencora
know
that
there
be
no
need
for
apprehension
then
.
<EOS>
indeed
Madame
Goesler
be
no
more
than
any
other
guest
,
and
the
Duke
hardly
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
Duchess
there
,
 
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
,
and
old
Lady
Hartletop
,
who
be
a
dowager
marchioness
,
 
an
old
lady
who
pester
the
Duke
very
sorely
,

<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
receive
her
reward
,

know
that
she
be
receive
it
,
in
be
ask
to
meet
these
people

Would
not

include
her
own
,
be
blazon
to
the
world
in
the
column
of
the
next
day
's
_
Morning
Post

?
<EOS>
there
be
no
absolute
danger
here
,
as
Lady
Glencora
know
;
and
Lady
Glencora
,
who
be
tolerant
and
begrudge
nothing
to
Madame
Max
except
the
one
thing
,
be
quite
willing
to
meet
the
lady
at
such
a
grand
affair
as
this
.
<EOS>
but
the
Duke
,
even
should
he
become
ever
so
childish
a
child
in
his
old
age
,
still
would
have
that
plain
green
brougham
at
his
command
,
and
could
go
anywhere
in
that
at
any
hour
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
and
then
Madame
Goesler
be
so
manifestly
a
clever
woman
.
<EOS>
a
duchess
of
omnium
may
be
say
to
fill
,
 
in
the
estimation
,
at
any
rate
,
of
english
people
,
 
the
high
position
in
the
world
short
of
royalty

the
reader
will
remember
that
Lady
Glencora
intend
to
be
a
Duchess
of
omnium
herself
,
 
unless
some
very
unexpected
event
should
intrude
itself

that
her

her
fair

curly

bold

little

should
be
Earl

out

who
have
his

to
bring
forward
that
very
night
,

who
in
truth

more
for
his

he
do
for
his

moment

we
must
prevent
it

Lady

have
not
as
yet
whisper
a
word
of
his
sickness
to
any
live
ear
;
and
he
have
begin
to
pine
for
the
lose
freedom
of
a
seat
below
the
gangway
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
discuss
political
honesty
with
Phineas
,
and
hence
have
come
the
sermon
of
which
I
have
venture
to
reproduce
the
conclude
denunciation
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
be
fond
of
such
discussion
and
fond
of
hold
them
with
Mr.
Monk
,
 
in
this
matter
flutter
like
a
moth
<EOS>
round
a
candle
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
perceive
that
as
he
have
make
up
his
mind
to
be
a
servant
of
the
public
in
Parliament
,
he
must
abandon
all
idea
of
independent
action
;
and
unless
he
do
so
he
could
be
neither
successful
as
regard
himself
,
or
useful
to
the
public
whom
he
serve
.
<EOS>
Could
a
man
be
honest
in
Parliament
,
and
yet
abandon
all
idea
of
independence
?
<EOS>
when
he
put
such
question
to
Mr.
Monk
he
do
not
get
a
direct
answer
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
the
question
be
never
put
directly
.
<EOS>
but
the
teaching
which
he
receive
be
ever
of
a
nature
to
make
him
uneasy
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
to
this
effect
:
"
You
have
take
up
the
trade
now
,
and
seem
to
be
fit
for
success
in
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
better
give
up
think
about
its
special
honesty
.
"
<EOS>
and
yet
Mr.
Monk
would
on
an
occasion
preach
to
him
such
a
sermon
as
that
which
he
have
just
utter
!
<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
no
question
more
difficult
to
a
man
's
mind
than
that
of
the
expediency
or
inexpediency
of
scruple
in
political
life
.
<EOS>
whether
would
a
candidate
for
office
be
more
liable
to
rejection
from
a
leader
because
he
be
know
to
be
scrupulous
,
or
because
he
be
know
to
be
the
reverse
?
  
<EOS>
"
but
put
aside
the
fourth
commandment
and
all
the
theory
,
you
will
come
to
Ireland
?
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
live
in
a
castle
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
everybody
do
live
in
a
castle
in
Ireland
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
They
seem
to
do
when
I
be
there
twenty
year
ago
.
<EOS>
but
for
myself
,
I
prefer
a
cottage
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
trip
to
Ireland
have
be
propose
in
consequence
of
certain
idea
respect
tenant
-
right
which
Mr.
Monk
be
begin
to
adopt
,
and
as
to
which
the
mind
of
politician
be
become
move
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
all
very
well
to
put
down
Fenianism
,
and
Ribandmen
,
and
Repeal
,
 
and
everything
that
have
be
put
down
in
Ireland
in
the
way
of
rebellion
for
the
last
seventy
-
five
year
.
<EOS>
England
and
Ireland
have
be
apparently
join
together
by
law
of
nature
so
fix
,
that
even
politician
liberal
as
be
Mr.
Monk
,
 
liberal
as
be
Mr.
Turnbull
,
 
could
not
trust
themselves
to
think
that
disunion
could
be
for
the
good
of
the
irish
.
<EOS>
They
have
teach
themselves
that
it
certainly
could
not
be
good
for
the
English
.
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
incumbent
on
England
to
force
upon
Ireland
the
maintenance
of
the
Union
for
her
own
sake
,
and
for
England
's
sake
,
because
England
could
not
afford
independence
establish
so
close
against
her
own
rib
,
 
it
be
at
any
rate
necessary
to
England
's
character
that
the
bride
thus
bind
in
a
compulsory
wedlock
should
be
endow
with
all
the
good
privilege
that
a
wife
can
enjoy
.
<EOS>
let
her
at
least
not
be
a
keep
mistress
.
<EOS>
let
it
be
bone
of
my
bone
and
flesh
of
my
flesh
,
if
we
be
to
live
together
in
the
married
state
.
<EOS>
between
husband
and
wife
a
warm
word
now
and
then
matter
but
little
,
if
there
be
a
thoroughly
good
understanding
at
bottom
.
<EOS>
but
let
there
be
that
good
understanding
at
bottom
.
<EOS>
what
about
this
Protestant
Church
;
and
what
about
this
tenant
<EOS>
-
right
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
have
be
ask
himself
these
question
for
some
time
past
.
<EOS>
in
regard
to
the
Church
,
he
have
long
make
up
his
mind
that
the
Establishment
in
Ireland
be
a
cry
sin
.
<EOS>
a
man
have
marry
a
woman
whom
he
know
to
be
of
a
religion
different
from
his
own
,
and
then
insist
that
his
wife
should
say
that
she
believe
those
thing
which
he
know
very
well
that
she
do
not
believe
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
Mr.
Monk
well
know
,
the
subject
of
the
Protestant
Endowments
in
Ireland
be
so
difficult
that
it
would
require
almost
more
than
human
wisdom
to
adjust
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
matter
which
almost
seem
to
require
the
interposition
of
some
high
power
,
 
the
coming
of
some
apparently
chance
event
,
 
to
clear
away
the
evil
;
as
a
fire
come
,
and
pestilential
alley
be
remove
;
as
a
famine
come
,
and
man
be
drive
from
want
and
ignorance
and
dirt
to
seek
new
home
and
new
thought
across
the
broad
water
;
as
a
war
come
,
and
slavery
be
banish
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
but
in
regard
to
tenant
-
right
,
to
some
arrangement
by
which
a
tenant
in
Ireland
may
be
at
least
encourage
to
lay
out
what
little
capital
he
may
have
in
labour
or
money
without
be
at
once
call
upon
to
pay
rent
for
that
outlay
which
be
his
own
,
as
well
as
for
the
land
which
be
not
his
own
,
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
think
that
it
be
possible
that
if
a
man
would
look
hard
enough
he
may
perhaps
be
able
to
see
his
way
as
to
that
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
to
two
of
his
colleague
on
the
subject
,
the
two
man
in
the
Cabinet
whom
he
believe
to
be
the
most
thoroughly
honest
in
their
idea
as
public
servant
,
the
Duke
and
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
to
be
do
;
 
and
then
so
little
be
know
upon
the
subject
!
<EOS>
"
I
will
endeavour
to
study
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
can
see
your
way
,
do
;
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
,
 
"
<EOS>
but
of
course
we
can
not
bind
ourselves
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
glad
to
see
it
name
in
the
Queen
's
speech
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
session
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
long
way
off
as
yet
,
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
who
will
be
in
then
,
and
who
will
be
out
?
"
<EOS>
so
the
matter
be
dispose
of
at
the
time
,
but
Mr.
Monk
do
not
abandon
his
idea
.
<EOS>
He
rather
feel
himself
the
more
bind
to
cling
to
it
because
he
receive
so
little
encouragement
.
<EOS>
what
be
a
seat
in
the
Cabinet
to
him
that
he
should
on
that
account
omit
a
duty
?
<EOS>
He
have
not
take
up
politic
as
a
trade
.
<EOS>
He
have
sit
far
behind
the
Treasury
bench
or
below
the
gangway
for
many
a
year
,
without
owe
any
man
a
shilling
,
 
and
could
afford
to
do
so
again
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
different
with
Phineas
Finn
,
as
Mr.
Monk
himself
understand
;
 
and
,
understand
this
<EOS>
,
he
feel
himself
bind
to
caution
his
young
friend
.
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
a
question
whether
his
caution
do
not
do
more
harm
than
good
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
,
"
he
say
,
"
to
go
over
with
you
in
August
,
but
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
if
I
be
you
,
I
would
take
up
this
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
not
?
<EOS>
You
do
not
want
to
fight
the
battle
singlehande
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
desire
no
such
glory
,
and
would
wish
to
have
no
well
lieutenant
than
you
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
a
subject
of
which
you
be
really
fond
,
which
you
be
begin
to
understand
,
and
in
regard
to
which
you
can
make
yourself
useful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
this
Canada
business
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
 
and
that
will
grow
to
other
matter
as
regard
the
colony
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
so
important
to
a
public
man
as
that
he
should
have
his
own
subject
;
 
the
thing
which
he
understand
,
and
in
respect
of
which
he
can
make
himself
really
useful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
there
come
a
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
and
the
man
who
have
half
learn
how
to
have
a
ship
build
without
waste
be
send
into
opposition
,
and
be
then
bring
back
to
look
after
regiment
,
or
perhaps
have
to
take
up
that
beautiful
subject
,
a
study
of
the
career
of
India
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
if
you
have
a
subject
,
stick
to
it
at
any
rate
as
long
as
it
will
stick
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
if
a
man
take
up
his
own
subject
,
independent
of
the
Government
,
no
man
can
drive
him
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
often
do
he
do
anything
?
<EOS>
look
at
the
annual
motion
which
come
forward
in
the
hand
of
private
man
,
 
Maynooth
and
the
ballot
for
instance
.
<EOS>
It
be
become
more
and
more
apparent
every
day
that
all
legislation
must
be
carry
by
the
Government
,
and
must
be
carry
in
obedience
to
the
express
wish
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
the
true
democracy
that
ever
have
a
chance
of
living
be
that
which
we
be
now
establish
in
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
leave
tenant
-
right
to
the
people
and
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
why
should
you
take
it
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
pause
a
moment
or
two
before
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
choose
to
run
a
-
muck
,
there
be
no
reason
why
you
should
follow
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
old
and
you
be
young
.
<EOS>
I
want
nothing
from
politic
as
a
profession
,
and
you
do
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
you
have
a
congenial
subject
where
you
be
,
and
nee
not
disturb
yourself
.
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
tell
you
,
in
confidence
,
that
I
can
not
speak
so
comfortably
of
my
own
position
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
and
see
,
at
any
rate
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
,
"
we
will
go
and
see
.
<EOS>
"
and
thus
,
in
the
month
of
May
,
it
be
settle
between
them
that
,
as
soon
as
the
session
should
be
over
,
and
the
incidental
work
of
his
office
should
allow
Phineas
to
pack
up
and
be
off
,
they
two
should
start
together
for
Ireland
.
<EOS>
Phineas
feel
rather
proud
as
he
write
to
his
father
and
ask
permission
to
bring
home
with
him
a
Cabinet
Minister
as
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
at
this
time
the
reputation
of
Phineas
at
Killaloe
,
as
well
in
the
mind
of
the
Killaloeians
generally
as
in
those
of
the
inhabitant
of
the
paternal
house
,
stand
very
high
indeed
.
<EOS>
how
could
a
father
think
that
a
son
have
do
badly
when
before
he
be
thirty
year
of
age
he
be
earn
£
2,000
a
year
?
<EOS>
and
how
could
a
father
not
think
well
of
a
son
who
have
absolutely
pay
back
certain
money
into
the
paternal
coffer
?
<EOS>
the
money
so
repay
have
not
be
much
;
but
the
repayment
of
any
such
money
at
Killaloe
have
be
regard
as
little
short
of
miraculous
.
<EOS>
the
news
of
Mr.
Monk
's
come
fly
about
the
town
,
about
the
county
,
about
the
diocese
,
and
all
people
begin
to
say
all
good
thing
about
the
old
doctor
's
only
son
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
have
long
since
be
quite
sure
that
a
real
black
swan
have
be
send
forth
out
of
her
nest
.
<EOS>
and
the
sister
Finn
,
for
some
time
past
,
have
feel
in
all
social
gathering
they
stand
quite
on
a
different
footing
than
formerly
because
of
their
brother
.
<EOS>
They
be
ask
about
in
the
county
,
and
two
of
them
have
be
stay
only
last
Easter
with
the
Molonys
,
 
the
Molonys
of
Poldoodie
!
<EOS>
how
should
a
father
and
a
mother
and
sister
not
be
grateful
to
such
a
son
,
to
such
a
brother
,
to
such
a
veritable
black
swan
out
of
the
nest
!
<EOS>
and
as
for
dear
little
Mary
Flood
Jones
,
her
eye
become
suffused
with
tear
as
in
her
solitude
<EOS>
she
think
how
much
out
of
her
reach
this
swan
be
fly
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
take
joy
in
his
swanhood
,
and
swear
that
she
would
love
him
still
;
 
that
she
would
love
him
always
.
<EOS>
may
he
bring
home
with
him
to
Killaloe
,
Mr.
Monk
,
the
Cabinet
Minister
!
<EOS>
of
course
he
may
.
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Finn
first
hear
of
this
august
arrival
,
she
feel
as
though
she
would
like
to
expend
herself
in
entertain
,
though
but
an
hour
,
the
whole
cabinet
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
during
the
spring
,
have
,
of
course
,
meet
Mr.
Kennedy
frequently
in
and
about
the
House
,
and
have
become
aware
that
Lady
Laura
's
husband
,
from
time
to
time
,
make
little
overture
of
civility
to
him
,
 
take
him
now
and
again
by
the
button
-
hole
,
walk
home
with
him
as
far
as
their
joint
path
allow
,
and
ask
him
once
or
twice
to
come
and
dine
in
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
these
little
advance
towards
a
repetition
of
the
old
friendship
Phineas
would
have
avoid
altogether
,
have
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
the
invitation
to
Mr.
Kennedy
's
house
he
do
refuse
,
feel
himself
positively
bind
to
do
so
by
Lady
Laura
's
command
,
let
the
consequence
be
what
they
may
.
<EOS>
when
he
do
refuse
,
Mr.
Kennedy
would
assume
a
look
of
displeasure
and
leave
him
,
and
Phineas
would
hope
that
the
work
be
do
.
<EOS>
then
there
would
come
another
encounter
,
and
the
invitation
would
be
repeat
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
about
the
middle
of
May
,
there
come
another
note
.
<EOS>
"
Dear
Finn
,
will
you
dine
with
us
on
Wednesday
,
the
28th
?
<EOS>
I
give
you
a
long
notice
,
because
you
seem
to
have
so
many
appointment
.
<EOS>
Yours
always
,
Robert
Kennedy
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
He
must
refuse
,
even
though
double
the
notice
have
be
give
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
think
that
Mr.
Kennedy
be
a
very
obtuse
man
and
one
who
would
not
take
a
hint
,
and
hope
that
he
may
succeed
at
last
.
<EOS>
so
he
write
an
answer
,
not
intend
to
be
conciliatory
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Kennedy
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
that
I
be
engage
on
the
28th
.
<EOS>
yours
always
,
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
at
this
period
he
do
his
good
to
keep
out
of
Mr.
Kennedy
's
way
,
and
would
be
very
cunning
in
his
manoeuvre
that
they
should
not
be
alone
together
.
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
,
as
they
sit
on
the
same
bench
in
the
House
,
and
consequently
see
each
other
almost
every
day
of
their
life
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
think
that
with
a
little
cunning
he
may
prevail
,
especially
as
he
be
not
unwilling
to
give
so
much
of
offence
as
may
assist
his
own
object
.
<EOS>
but
when
Mr.
Kennedy
call
upon
him
at
his
office
the
day
after
he
have
write
the
above
note
,
he
have
no
means
of
escape
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
you
can
not
come
to
us
on
the
28th
,
"
Mr.
Kennedy
say
,
as
soon
as
he
be
seat
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
be
take
so
much
by
surprise
that
all
his
cunning
fail
him
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
yes
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
be
very
sorry
;
 
very
sorry
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me
,
Finn
,
that
you
have
have
some
reason
for
avoid
me
of
late
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
have
do
anything
to
offend
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
nothing
on
earth
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
wrong
,
then
,
in
suppose
that
anything
beyond
mere
chance
have
prevent
you
from
come
to
my
house
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
feel
that
he
be
in
a
terrible
difficulty
,
and
he
feel
also
that
he
be
be
rather
ill
-
use
in
be
thus
cross
-
examined
as
to
his
reason
for
not
go
to
a
gentleman
's
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
a
man
ought
to
be
allow
to
choose
where
he
would
go
and
where
he
would
not
go
,
and
that
question
such
as
these
be
very
uncommon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
be
sit
opposite
to
him
,
look
more
grave
and
more
sour
than
usual
;
 
and
now
his
own
countenance
also
become
a
little
solemn
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
he
should
use
Lady
Laura
's
name
,
and
yet
he
must
,
in
some
way
,
let
his
persecute
friend
know
that
no
further
invitation
would
be
of
any
use
;
 
that
there
be
something
beyond
mere
chance
in
his
not
go
to
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
but
how
be
he
to
do
this
?
<EOS>
the
difficulty
be
so
great
that
he
could
not
see
his
way
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
so
he
sit
silent
with
a
solemn
face
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
then
ask
him
another
question
,
which
make
the
difficulty
ten
time
great
.
"
<EOS>
have
my
wife
ask
you
not
to
come
to
our
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
now
that
he
should
make
a
rush
and
get
out
of
his
trouble
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
"
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
Kennedy
,
I
do
not
think
she
want
to
see
me
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
do
not
answer
my
question
.
<EOS>
have
she
ask
you
not
to
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
say
that
which
leave
on
my
mind
an
impression
that
she
would
sooner
that
I
do
not
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
she
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
answer
such
a
question
as
that
,
Kennedy
?
<EOS>
be
it
fair
to
ask
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
fair
,
 
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
quite
unfair
,
and
I
must
decline
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
what
you
expect
to
gain
by
cross
-
question
me
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
of
course
no
man
like
to
go
to
a
house
if
he
do
not
believe
that
everybody
there
will
make
him
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
and
Lady
Laura
use
to
be
great
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
be
not
enemy
now
.
<EOS>
but
thing
will
occur
that
cause
friendship
to
grow
cool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
quarrel
with
her
father

"
  
"
with
Lord
Brentford
?
 
no

"
  
"
<EOS>
or
with
her
brother

since
the
duel
I
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
upon
my
word
and
honour
I
can
not
stand
this
,
and
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
as
yet
quarrel
with
anybody
;
but
I
must
quarrel
with
you
,
if
you
go
on
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
unusual
that
a
man
should
be
put
through
his
facing
after
such
a
fashion
,
and
I
must
beg
that
there
may
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
must
ask
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
say
what
you
like
to
your
own
wife
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
hinder
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
upon
that
Mr.
Kennedy
formally
shake
hand
with
him
,
in
token
that
there
be
no
positive
breach
between
them
,
 
as
two
nation
may
still
maintain
their
alliance
,
though
they
have
make
up
their
mind
to
hate
each
other
,
and
thwart
each
other
at
every
turn
,
 
and
take
his
leave
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
sit
at
his
window
,
look
out
into
the
park
,
and
thinking
of
what
have
pass
,
could
not
but
reflect
that
,
disagreeable
as
Mr.
Kennedy
have
be
to
him
,
he
would
probably
make
himself
much
more
disagreeable
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
and
,
for
himself
,
he
think
that
he
have
get
out
of
the
scrape
very
well
by
the
exhibition
of
a
little
mock
anger
.
   
<EOS>
the
Earl
's
wrath
 
<EOS>
the
reader
may
remember
that
a
rumour
have
be
convey
to
Phineas
,
 
a
rumour
indeed
which
reach
him
from
a
source
which
he
regard
as
very
untrustworthy
,
 
that
Violet
Effingham
have
quarrel
with
her
lover
.
<EOS>
He
would
probably
have
pay
no
attention
to
the
rumour
,
beyond
that
which
necessarily
attach
itself
to
any
tiding
as
to
a
matter
so
full
of
interest
to
him
,
have
it
not
be
repeat
to
him
in
another
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
a
bird
have
tell
me
that
your
Violet
Effingham
have
break
with
her
lover
,
"
Madame
Goesler
say
to
him
one
day
.
"
<EOS>
what
bird
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
"
ah
,
that
I
can
not
tell
you
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
will
confess
to
you
,
that
these
bird
which
tell
us
news
be
seldom
very
credible
,
 
and
be
often
not
very
creditable
,
You
must
take
a
bird
's
word
for
what
it
may
be
worth
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
they
have
quarrel
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
,
if
the
truth
be
know
,
they
be
bill
and
cooing
in
each
other
's
arm
at
this
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
do
not
like
to
be
tell
of
their
billing
and
cooing
,
 
do
not
like
to
be
tell
even
of
their
quarrelling
.
<EOS>
though
they
be
to
quarrel
,
it
would
do
him
no
good
.
<EOS>
He
would
rather
that
nobody
should
mention
their
name
to
him
;
 
so
that
his
back
,
which
have
be
so
utterly
broken
,
may
in
process
of
time
get
itself
cure
.
<EOS>
from
what
he
know
of
Violet
he
think
it
very
improbable
that
,
even
be
she
to
quarrel
with
one
lover
,
she
would
at
once
throw
herself
into
the
arm
of
another
.
<EOS>
and
he
do
feel
,
too
,
that
there
would
be
some
meanness
in
take
her
,
be
she
willing
to
be
so
take
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
these
rumour
,
come
to
him
in
this
way
from
different
source
,
almost
make
it
incumbent
on
him
to
find
out
the
truth
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
think
that
his
break
back
be
not
cure
;
 
that
perhaps
,
after
all
,
it
be
not
in
the
way
of
be
cure
,
and
be
it
not
possible
that
there
may
be
explanation
?
<EOS>
then
he
go
to
work
and
build
castle
in
the
air
,
so
construct
as
to
admit
of
the
possibility
of
Violet
Effingham
become
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
this
have
be
in
April
,
and
at
that
time
all
that
he
know
of
Violet
be
,
that
she
be
not
yet
in
London
.
<EOS>
and
he
think
that
he
know
the
same
as
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
have
tell
him
that
Chiltern
be
not
in
town
,
nor
expect
in
town
as
yet
;
and
in
say
so
have
seem
to
express
displeasure
against
his
son
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
meet
Lady
Baldock
at
some
house
which
he
frequent
,
and
have
be
quite
surprised
to
find
himself
graciously
receive
by
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
not
a
word
of
Violet
,
but
have
speak
of
Lord
Chiltern
,
 
mention
his
name
in
bitter
wrath
.
"
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
friend
of
mine
,
"
say
Phineas
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
friend
indeed
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
sort
of
a
friend
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
that
you
be
his
friend
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
he
be
not
worthy
of
have
any
friend
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
do
not
quite
understand
from
this
that
Lady
Baldock
be
signify
to
him
that
,
badly
as
she
have
think
of
him
as
a
suitor
for
her
niece
,
she
would
have
prefer
him
,
 
especially
now
when
people
be
begin
to
speak
well
of
him
,
 
to
that
terrible
young
man
,
who
,
from
his
youth
upwards
,
have
be
to
her
a
cause
of
fear
and
tremble
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
desirable
that
Violet
should
marry
an
eld
son
,
and
a
peer
's
heir
.
<EOS>
all
that
kind
of
thing
,
in
Lady
Baldock
's
eye
,
be
most
desirable
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
anything
be
well
than
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
if
Violet
would
not
take
Mr.
Appledom
or
Lord
Fawn
,
in
heaven
's
name
let
her
take
this
young
man
,
who
be
kind
,
worthy
,
and
steady
,
who
be
civilised
in
his
manner
,
and
would
no
doubt
be
amenable
in
regard
to
settlement
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
have
so
far
fall
in
the
world
that
she
would
have
consent
to
make
a
bargain
with
her
niece
,
 
almost
any
bargain
,
so
long
as
Lord
Chiltern
be
exclude
.
<EOS>
Phineas
do
not
quite
understand
all
this
;
but
when
Lady
Baldock
ask
him
to
come
to
Berkeley
Square
,
he
perceive
that
help
be
be
proffer
to
him
where
he
certainly
have
not
look
for
help
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
frequently
with
Lord
Brentford
,
who
talk
to
him
constantly
on
matter
connect
with
his
parliamentary
life
.
<EOS>
after
have
be
the
intimate
friend
of
the
daughter
and
of
the
son
,
it
now
seem
to
be
his
lot
to
be
the
intimate
friend
of
the
father
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
have
constantly
discuss
with
him
his
arrangement
with
his
son
,
and
have
lately
express
himself
as
only
half
satisfied
with
such
reconciliation
as
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
and
Phineas
could
perceive
that
from
day
to
day
the
Earl
be
less
and
less
satisfied
.
<EOS>
He
would
complain
bitterly
of
his
son
,
 
complain
of
his
silence
,
complain
of
his
not
come
to
London
,
complain
of
his
conduct
to
Violet
,
complain
of
his
idle
indifference
to
anything
like
proper
occupation
;
but
he
have
never
as
yet
say
a
word
to
show
that
there
have
be
any
quarrel
between
Violet
and
her
lover
,
and
Phineas
have
feel
that
he
could
not
ask
the
question
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
say
the
Earl
to
him
one
morning
,
as
soon
as
he
enter
the
room
,
"
I
have
just
hear
a
story
which
have
almost
seem
to
me
to
be
incredible
.
<EOS>
"
the
nobleman
's
manner
be
very
stern
,
and
the
fact
that
he
call
his
young
friend
"
Mr.
Finn
"
,
show
at
once
that
something
be
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
you
have
hear
,
my
lord
?
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
you
and
Chiltern
go
over
,
 
last
year
to
,
 
Belgium
,
and
fight
,
 
a
duel
there
!
"
  
<EOS>
now
it
must
have
be
the
case
that
,
in
the
set
among
which
they
all
live
,
 
Lord
Brentford
and
his
son
and
daughter
and
Phineas
Finn
,
 
the
old
lord
be
the
only
man
who
have
not
hear
of
the
duel
before
this
.
<EOS>
It
have
even
penetrate
to
the
dull
ear
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
remind
him
,
as
it
do
so
,
that
his
wife
have
,
 
tell
him
a
lie
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
fact
that
no
rumour
of
the
duel
have
reach
the
Earl
till
this
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
true
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
be
so
much
shocked
in
my
life
;
 
never
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
that
you
have
any
thought
of
aspire
to
the
hand
of
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
lord
's
voice
as
he
say
this
be
very
stern
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
I
aspire
in
vain
,
and
as
Chiltern
have
be
successful
,
that
need
not
now
be
make
a
reproach
against
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
to
think
of
it
,
Mr.
Finn

<EOS>
I
be
so
much
surprised
that
I
hardly
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
must
declare
my
opinion
at
once
,
that
you
behave
,
 
very
badly
.

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
much
you
know

my
lord

how
much
you
do
not

the
circumstance
of
the
little
affair
do
not
permit
me
to
be
explicit
about
them
;
but
,
as
you
have
express
your
opinion
<EOS>
so
openly
you
must
allow
me
to
express
mine
,
and
to
say
that
,
as
far
as
I
can
judge
of
my
own
action
,
I
do
not
behave
badly
at
all

you

duelling

no

if
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
a
duel
be
of
itself
sinful

I
have
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
.
<EOS>
My
defence
of
myself
merely
go
to
the
manner
in
which
this
duel
be
fight
,
and
the
fact
that
I
fight
it
with
your
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
conceive
how
you
can
have
come
to
my
house
as
my
guest
,
and
stand
upon
my
interest
for
my
borough
,
when
you
at
the
time
be
do
your
very
good
to
interpose
yourself
between
Chiltern
and
the
lady
whom
you
so
well
know
I
wish
to
become
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
be
aware
that
the
Earl
must
have
be
very
much
moved
indeed
when
he
thus
permit
himself
to
speak
of
"
his
"
borough
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
now
,
however
,
though
the
Earl
pause
;
 
and
then
the
angry
lord
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
that
there
be
something
,
 
something
almost
approach
to
duplicity
in
such
conduct
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
to
defend
myself
by
evidence
,
Lord
Brentford
,
I
should
have
to
go
back
to
exact
date
,
 
and
date
not
of
fact
which
I
could
verify
,
but
date
as
to
my
feeling
which
could
not
be
verify
,
 
and
that
would
be
useless
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
I
believe
I
know
what
the
honour
and
truth
of
a
gentleman
demand
,
 
even
to
the
verge
of
self
-
sacrifice
,
and
that
I
have
do
nothing
that
ought
to
place
my
character
as
a
gentleman
in
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
ask
your
son
,
I
think
he
will
tell
you
the
same
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
ask
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
he
who
tell
me
of
the
duel

"
  
<EOS>
"
when
do
he
tell
you
,
my
lord
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
now
;
this
morning
.

"
<EOS>
thus
Phineas
learn
that
Lord
Chiltern
be
at
this
moment
in
the
house
,
 
or
at
least
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
he
complain
of
my
conduct
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
complain
of
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
complain
of
it
very
bitterly
.
<EOS>
I
place
the
great
confidence
in
you
,
especially
in
regard
to
my
son
's
affair
,
and
you
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Earl
be
very
angry
,
and
be
more
angry
from
the
fact
that
this
young
man
who
have
offend
him
,
to
whom
he
have
give
such
vital
assistance
when
assistance
be
need
,
have
use
that
assistance
to
its
utmost
before
his
sin
be
find
out
.
<EOS>
have
Phineas
still
be
sit
for
Loughton
,
so
that
the
Earl
could
have
say
to
him
,
"
You
be
now
bind
to
retreat
from
this
borough
because
you
have
offend
me
,
your
patron
,
"
I
think
that
he
would
have
forgive
the
offender
and
allow
him
to
remain
in
his
seat
.
<EOS>
there
would
have
be
a
scene
,
and
the
Earl
would
have
be
pacify
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
offender
be
beyond
his
reach
altogether
,
have
use
the
borough
as
a
most
convenient
stepping
-
stone
over
his
difficulty
,
and
have
so
use
it
just
at
the
time
when
he
be
commit
this
sin
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
fortune
about
Phineas
which
add
greatly
to
the
lord
's
wrath
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
have
not
that
rich
consolation
for
which
Phineas
give
him
credit
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
have
tell
him
that
morning
that
the
engagement
between
him
and
Violet
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
so
preach
to
her
,
my
lord
,
about
my
duty
,
"
the
son
have
say
to
his
father
,
"
that
she
find
herself
oblige
to
give
me
your
sermon
at
second
hand
,
till
I
can
bear
them
no
longer
.
"
<EOS>
but
of
this
Phineas
know
nothing
as
yet
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
,
however
,
be
so
imprudent
in
his
anger
that
before
this
interview
be
over
he
have
tell
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
 
<EOS>
you
deceive
me
,
"
he
continue
;
"
and
I
can
never
trust
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
for
me
,
my
lord
,
to
tell
you
of
that
which
would
have
increase
your
anger
against
your
own
son
?
<EOS>
when
he
want
me
to
fight
be
I
to
come
,
like
a
sneak
at
school
,
and
tell
you
the
story
?
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
would
have
think
of
me
have
I
do
so
.
<EOS>
and
when
it
be
over
be
I
to
come
and
tell
you
then
?
<EOS>
think
what
you
yourself
would
have
do
when
you
be
young
,
and
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
I
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
what
have
I
gain
?
<EOS>
He
have
get
all
that
he
want
;
and
you
have
also
get
all
that
you
want
;
 
and
I
have
help
you
both
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
,
I
can
put
my
hand
on
my
heart
and
say
that
I
have
be
honest
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
nothing
that
I
want
,
"
say
the
Earl
in
his
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Chiltern
and
Miss
Effingham
will
be
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
they
will
not
.
<EOS>
He
have
quarrel
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
obstinate
that
she
will
not
bear
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
it
be
all
true
,
even
though
the
rumour
have
reach
him
through
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
,
my
lord
,
that
have
not
be
my
fault
,
"
he
say
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
be
walk
up
and
down
the
room
,
angry
with
himself
at
his
own
mistake
in
have
tell
the
story
,
and
not
know
what
further
to
say
to
his
visitor
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
the
habit
of
talk
so
freely
to
Phineas
about
his
son
that
he
could
hardly
resist
the
temptation
of
do
so
still
;
and
yet
it
be
impossible
that
he
could
swallow
his
anger
and
continue
in
the
same
strain
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
say
Phineas
,
after
a
while
,
"
I
can
assure
you
that
I
grieve
that
you
should
be
grieve
.
<EOS>
I
have
receive
so
much
undeserved
favour
from
your
family
,
that
I
owe
you
a
debt
which
I
can
never
pay
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
that
you
should
be
angry
with
me
now
;
but
I
hope
that
a
time
may
come
when
you
will
think
less
severely
of
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
about
to
leave
the
room
when
the
Earl
stop
him
.
"
<EOS>
Will
you
give
me
your
word
,
"
say
the
Earl
,
"
that
you
will
think
no
more
of
Miss
Effingham
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
stand
silent
,
consider
how
he
may
answer
this
proposal
,
resolve
that
nothing
should
bring
him
to
such
a
pledge
as
that
suggest
while
there
be
yet
a
ledge
for
hope
to
stand
on
.
"
<EOS>
say
that
,
Mr.
Finn
,
and
I
will
forgive
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
acknowledge
that
I
have
do
anything
to
be
forgive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
say
that
,
"
repeat
the
Earl
,
"
and
everything
shall
be
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
need
be
no
cause
for
alarm
,
my
lord
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
sure
that
Miss
Effingham
will
not
think
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
your
word
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
lord
;
 
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
right
to
ask
it
,
and
the
pursuit
be
open
to
me
as
to
any
other
man
who
may
choose
to
follow
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
a
vestige
of
a
hope
of
success
.
<EOS>
It
be
barely
possible
that
I
should
succeed
.
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
true
that
Miss
Effingham
be
disengage
,
I
shall
endeavour
to
find
an
opportunity
of
urge
my
suit
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
up
everything
that
I
have
,
my
seat
in
Parliament
,
all
the
ambition
of
my
life
,
for
the
bare
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
accept
your
son
,
I
desist
,
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
hear
,
from
more
source
than
one
,
that
she
or
he
or
both
of
them
have
change
their
mind
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
so
,
I
be
free
to
try
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Earl
stand
opposite
to
him
,
scowl
at
him
,
but
say
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
good
morning
,
my
lord

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
morning
,
sir
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
must
be
good
-
bye
,
for
some
long
day
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
morning
,
sir
,
"
and
the
Earl
as
he
speak
rang
the
bell
.
<EOS>
then
Phineas
take
up
his
hat
and
depart
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
walk
away
his
mind
fill
itself
gradually
with
various
idea
,
all
spring
from
the
word
which
Lord
Brentford
have
speak
.
<EOS>
what
account
have
Lord
Chiltern
give
to
his
father
of
the
duel
?
<EOS>
Our
hero
be
a
man
very
sensitive
as
to
the
good
opinion
of
other
,
and
in
spite
of
his
bold
assertion
of
his
own
knowledge
of
what
become
a
gentleman
,
be
beyond
measure
solicitous
that
other
should
acknowledge
his
claim
at
any
rate
to
that
title
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
he
have
be
generous
to
Lord
Chiltern
;
and
as
he
go
back
in
his
memory
over
almost
every
word
that
have
be
speak
in
the
interview
that
have
just
pass
,
he
fancy
that
he
be
able
to
collect
evidence
that
his
antagonist
at
Blankenberg
have
not
speak
ill
of
him
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
charge
of
deceit
which
the
Earl
have
make
against
him
,
he
tell
himself
that
the
Earl
have
make
it
in
anger
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
even
think
hardly
of
the
Earl
who
have
be
so
good
<EOS>
a
friend
to
him
,
<EOS>
but
he
believe
in
his
heart
that
the
Earl
have
make
the
accusation
out
of
his
wrath
and
not
out
of
his
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
can
not
think
that
I
have
be
false
to
him
,
"
Phineas
say
to
himself
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
very
sad
to
him
that
he
should
have
to
quarrel
with
all
the
family
of
the
Standishes
,
as
he
could
not
but
feel
that
it
be
they
who
have
put
him
on
his
foot
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
though
he
be
never
to
see
Lady
Laura
again
except
when
they
chance
to
meet
in
company
,
 
on
which
occasion
he
simply
bow
to
her
.
<EOS>
now
the
Earl
have
almost
turn
him
out
of
his
house
.
<EOS>
and
though
there
have
be
to
a
certain
extent
a
reconciliation
between
him
and
Lord
Chiltern
,
he
in
these
day
never
see
the
friend
who
have
once
put
him
upon
Bonebreaker
;
and
now
,
 
now
that
Violet
Effingham
be
again
free
,
 
how
be
it
possible
to
avoid
some
renewal
of
enmity
between
them
?
<EOS>
He
would
,
however
,
endeavour
to
see
Lord
Chiltern
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
he
think
of
Violet
,
 
of
Violet
again
free
,
of
Violet
as
again
a
possible
wife
for
himself
,
of
Violet
to
whom
he
may
address
himself
at
any
rate
without
any
scruple
as
to
his
own
unworthiness
.
<EOS>
everybody
concern
,
and
many
who
be
not
concerned
at
all
,
be
aware
that
he
have
be
among
her
lover
,
and
he
think
that
he
could
perceive
that
those
who
interest
themselves
on
the
subject
,
have
regard
him
as
the
only
horse
in
the
race
likely
to
run
with
success
against
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
She
herself
have
receive
his
offer
without
scorn
,
and
have
always
treat
him
as
though
he
be
a
favour
friend
,
though
not
favour
as
a
lover
.
<EOS>
and
now
even
Lady
Baldock
be
smile
upon
him
,
and
ask
him
to
her
house
as
though
the
red
-
faced
porter
in
the
hall
in
Berkeley
Square
have
never
be
order
to
refuse
him
a
moment
's
admission
inside
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
very
humble
in
speak
of
his
own
hope
to
the
Earl
,
but
surely
there
may
be
a
chance
.
<EOS>
what
if
after
all
the
little
strain
which
he
have
have
in
his
back
be
to
be
cure
after
such
a
fashion
as
this
!
<EOS>
when
he
get
to
his
lodging
,
he
find
a
card
from
Lady
Baldock
,
inform
him
that
Lady
Baldock
would
be
at
home
on
a
certain
night
,
and
that
there
would
be
music
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
to
Lady
Baldock
's
on
the
night
name
,
as
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
be
in
the
House
;
 
nor
do
he
much
care
to
go
there
,
as
Violet
Effingham
be
not
in
town
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
call
and
explain
,
and
endeavour
to
curry
favour
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
He
at
once
write
a
note
to
Lord
Chiltern
,
which
he
address
to
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
"
as
you
be
in
town
,
can
we
not
meet
?
<EOS>
come
and
dine
with
me
at
the
 
Club
on
Saturday
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
note
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
day
he
receive
the
follow
answer
,
date
from
the
Bull
at
Willingford
.
<EOS>
why
on
earth
should
chiltern
be
stay
at
the
Bull
at
Willingford
in
May
?
  
<EOS>
the
old
shop
at
W
 
,
Friday
.
  
<EOS>
dear
PHINEAS
,
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
dine
with
you
,
because
I
be
down
here
,
look
after
the
cripple
,
and
write
a
sporting
novel
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
I
ought
to
do
something
,
so
I
be
go
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
do
not
think
I
turn
informer
against
you
in
tell
the
Earl
of
our
pleasant
little
meeting
on
the
sand
.
<EOS>
It
have
become
necessary
,
and
you
be
too
much
of
a
man
to
care
much
for
any
truth
be
tell
.
<EOS>
He
be
terribly
angry
both
with
me
and
with
you
;
but
the
fact
be
,
he
be
so
blindly
unreasonable
that
one
can
not
regard
his
anger
.
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
tell
the
story
truly
,
and
,
so
tell
,
it
certainly
should
not
have
injure
you
in
his
estimation
.
<EOS>
but
it
do
.
<EOS>
very
sorry
,
old
fellow
,
and
I
hope
you
will
get
over
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
deal
more
important
to
me
than
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
  
C.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
word
about
Violet
.
<EOS>
but
then
it
be
hardly
to
be
expect
that
there
should
be
word
about
Violet
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
likely
that
a
man
should
write
to
his
rival
of
his
own
failure
.
<EOS>
but
yet
there
be
a
flavour
of
violet
in
the
letter
which
would
not
have
be
there
,
so
Phineas
think
,
if
the
writer
have
be
despondent
.
<EOS>
the
pleasant
little
meeting
on
the
sand
have
be
convene
altogether
in
respect
of
Violet
.
<EOS>
and
the
telling
of
the
story
to
the
Earl
must
have
arise
from
discussion
about
Violet
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
must
have
tell
his
father
that
Phineas
be
his
rival
.
<EOS>
Could
the
reject
suitor
have
write
on
such
a
subject
in
such
a
strain
to
such
a
correspondent
if
he
have
believe
his
own
rejection
to
be
certain
?
<EOS>
but
then
Lord
Chiltern
be
not
like
anybody
else
in
the
world
,
and
it
be
impossible
to
judge
of
him
by
one
's
experience
of
the
motive
of
other
.
  
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
Phineas
do
call
in
Berkeley
Square
,
and
be
show
up
at
once
into
Lady
Baldock
's
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
the
whole
aspect
of
the
porter
's
countenance
be
change
towards
him
,
and
from
this
,
too
,
he
gather
good
augury
<EOS>
this
have
surprise
him
;
but
his
surprise
be
far
great
,
when
,
on
enter
the
room
,
he
find
Violet
Effingham
there
alone
.
<EOS>
a
little
fresh
colour
come
to
her
face
as
she
greet
him
,
though
it
can
not
be
say
that
she
blush
.
<EOS>
She
behave
herself
admirably
,
not
endeavour
to
conceal
some
little
emotion
at
thus
meet
him
,
but
betray
none
that
be
injurious
to
her
composure
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
to
see
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
have
just
leave
me
,
and
will
be
back
directly
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
by
no
means
her
equal
in
his
management
of
himself
on
the
occasion
;
but
perhaps
it
may
be
acknowledge
that
his
position
be
the
more
difficult
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
see
her
since
her
engagement
have
be
proclaim
to
the
world
,
and
now
he
have
hear
from
a
source
which
be
not
to
be
doubt
,
that
it
have
be
break
off
.
<EOS>
of
course
there
be
nothing
to
be
say
on
that
matter
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
congratulate
her
in
the
one
case
,
nor
could
he
either
congratulate
her
or
condole
with
her
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
do
not
know
how
to
speak
to
her
as
though
no
such
event
have
occur
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
you
be
in
town
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
come
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
,
you
know
,
at
Rome
with
the
Effinghams
;
and
since
that
I
have
be
 
;
but
,
indeed
,
I
have
be
such
a
vagrant
that
I
can
not
tell
you
of
all
my
coming
and
going
.
<EOS>
and
you
,
 
you
be
hard
at
work

<EOS>
"
oh
yes
;
 
always

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
right
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
be
something
,
if
it
be
only
a
stick
in
wait
,
or
a
door

keeper

<EOS>
It
be
so
good
to
be
something
.
"
<EOS>
be
it
some
such
teaching
as
this
that
have
jar
against
Lord
Chiltern
's
susceptibility
,
and
have
seem
to
him
to
be
a
repetition
of
his
father
's
sermon
?
  
<EOS>
"
a
man
should
try
to
be
something
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
a
woman
must
be
content
to
be
nothing
,
 
unless
Mr.
Mill
can
pull
us
through
!

now
,
tell
me
,
 
have
you
see
Lady
Laura

not
lately

I
sometimes

I

upon
which
Phineas
smile
and
shake
his
head

"
I
be
very
sorry

<EOS>
"
there
be
no
quarrel

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
use
to
think
that
you
and
he
may
do
so
much
for
each
other
,
 
that
is
,
of
course
,
if
you
could
make
a

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
man
of
whom
it
be
very
hard
to
make
a
friend
,
"
say
Phineas
,
feel
that
he
be
dishonest
to
Mr.
Kennedy
in
say
so
,

think
that
such
dishonesty
be
justify
by
what
he
owe
to
Lady
Laura

<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
he
be
hard
,

what
I
call
ungenial

We
will
not

anything
about
him

will
we
?

have
you
see
much
of
the
Earl

<EOS>
this
she
ask
as

such
a
question
have
no
reference
whatever
to
Lord

Mr.

she
ring
the
bell

now
I
have
tell

about

at

luckily

<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
have
take
up
music
this
season
,
but
all
her
enthusiasm
be
unable
to
shake
the
conscientious
zeal
of
the
young
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
.

at
such
a
gathering
he
would
have
be
unable

<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
's
Politics
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
remember
that
when
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
be
show
into
Madame
Goesler
's
room
,
Madame
Goesler
have
just
explain
somewhat
forcibly
to
the
Duke
of
omnium
her
reason
for
refuse
the
loan
of
his
Grace
's
villa
at
Como
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
the
Duke
in
so
many
word
that
she
do
not
mean
to
give
the
world
an
opportunity
of
malign
her
,
and
it
would
then
have
be
leave
to
the
Duke
to
decide
whether
any
other
arrangement
may
have
be
make
for
take
Madame
Goesler
to
Como
,
have
he
not
be
interrupt
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
very
anxious
to
take
her
<EOS>
be
certain
.
<EOS>
the
green
brougham
have
already
be
often
enough
at
the
door
in
Park
Lane
to
make
his
grace
feel
that
Madame
Goesler
's
company
be
very
desirable
,
 
be
,
perhaps
,
of
all
thing
leave
for
his
enjoyment
,
the
one
thing
the
most
desirable
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
speak
to
her
husband
of
child
cry
for
the
top
brick
of
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
now
it
have
come
to
this
,
that
in
the
eye
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
Marie
Max
Goesler
be
the
top
brick
of
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
She
have
more
wit
for
him
than
other
woman
,
 
more
of
that
sort
of
wit
which
he
be
capable
of
enjoy
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
beauty
which
he
have
learn
to
think
more
alluring
than
other
beauty
.
<EOS>
He
be
sick
of
fair
face
,
and
fat
arm
,
and
free
neck
.
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
's
eye
sparkle
as
other
eye
do
not
sparkle
,
and
there
be
something
of
the
vagueness
of
mystery
in
the
very
blackness
and
gloss
and
abundance
of
her
hair
,
 
as
though
her
beauty
be
the
beauty
of
some
world
which
he
have
not
yet
know
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
quickness
and
yet
a
grace
of
motion
about
her
which
be
quite
new
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
lady
upon
whom
the
Duke
have
of
late
most
often
smile
have
be
somewhat
slow
,
 
perhaps
almost
heavy
,
 
though
,
no
doubt
,
graceful
withal
.
<EOS>
in
his
early
youth
he
remember
to
have
see
,
somewhere
in
Greece
,
such
a
houri
as
be
this
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
the
houri
in
that
case
have
run
off
with
the
captain
of
a
russian
vessel
engage
in
the
tallow
trade
;
but
not
the
less
be
there
leave
on
his
grace
's
mind
some
dreamy
memory
of
charm
which
have
impress
him
very
strongly
when
he
be
simply
a
young
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
have
have
at
his
command
not
so
convenient
a
mode
of
sudden
abduction
as
the
russian
captain
's
tallow
ship
.
<EOS>
press
hard
by
such
circumstance
as
these
,
there
be
no
know
how
the
Duke
may
have
get
out
of
his
difficulty
<EOS>
have
not
Lady
Glencora
appear
upon
the
scene
.
  
<EOS>
since
the
future
little
Lord
Silverbridge
have
be
bear
,
the
Duke
have
be
very
constant
in
his
worship
of
Lady
Glencora
,
and
as
,
from
year
to
year
,
a
little
brother
be
add
,
thus
make
the
family
very
strong
and
stable
,
his
act
of
worship
have
increase
;
but
with
his
worship
there
have
come
of
late
something
almost
of
dread
,
 
something
almost
of
obedience
,
which
have
make
those
who
be
immediately
about
the
Duke
declare
that
his
grace
be
a
good
deal
change
.
<EOS>
for
,
hitherto
,
whatever
may
have
be
the
Duke
's
weakness
,
he
certainly
have
know
no
master
.
<EOS>
His
heir
,
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
have
be
always
subject
to
him
.
<EOS>
His
other
relation
have
be
keep
at
such
a
distance
as
hardly
to
be
more
than
recognise
;
and
though
his
grace
no
doubt
have
have
his
intimacy
,
they
who
have
be
intimate
with
him
have
either
never
try
to
obtain
ascendancy
,
or
have
fail
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
whether
with
or
without
a
struggle
,
have
succeed
,
and
people
about
the
Duke
say
that
the
Duke
be
much
change
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fothergill
,
 
who
be
his
grace
's
man
of
business
,
and
who
be
not
a
favourite
with
Lady
Glencora
,
 
say
that
he
be
very
much
changed
indeed
.
<EOS>
find
his
grace
so
much
change
,
Mr.
Fothergill
have
make
a
little
attempt
at
dictation
himself
,
but
have
recede
with
finger
very
much
scorch
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
possible
that
the
Duke
be
become
in
the
slight
degree
weary
of
Lady
Glencora
's
thraldom
,
and
that
he
think
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
may
be
more
tender
with
him
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
however
,
intend
to
be
tender
only
on
one
condition
.
  
<EOS>
when
Lady
Glencora
enter
the
room
,
Madame
Goesler
receive
her
beautifully
.
<EOS>
"
how
lucky
that
you
should
have
come
just
when
his
grace
be
here
!
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
my
uncle
's
carriage
,
and
of
course
I
know
it
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
the
favour
be
to
him
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
,
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
;
I
be
come
.
<EOS>
if
my
word
be
to
be
doubt
in
that
point
,
I
must
insist
on
have
the
servant
up
;
I
must
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
to
drive
to
this
door
,
as
far
back
as
Grosvenor
Street
.
<EOS>
do
I
not
,
planty
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
planty
be
the
little
Lord
Silverbridge
as
be
to
be
,
if
nothing
unfortunate
intervene
,
who
be
now
sit
on
his
granduncle
's
knee
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dou
say
to
the
little
house
in
Park
Lane
,
"
say
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
 
because
I
forget
the
number
.
"
  
"
and
it
be
the
small
house
in
Park
Lane
,
so
the
evidence
be
complete
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
not
care
much
for
evidence
to
convince
Madame
Goesler
,
but
she
have
not
wish
her
uncle
to
think
that
he
be
watch
and
hunt
down
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
necessary
that
he
should
know
that
he
be
watch
,
but
thing
have
not
come
to
that
as
yet

<EOS>
"
how
be
Plantagenet
?

ask
the
Duke

answer
for

say
Lady
Glencora
to
her
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
be
very
well
,
but
he
almost
never
come
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
work
for
his
country
,
"
say
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
Your
papa
be
a
busy
,
useful
man
,
and
can
not
afford
time
to
play
with
a
little
boy
as
I
can
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
papa
be
not
a
duke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
some
day
,
and
that
probably
before
long
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
a
duke
quite
as
soon
as
he
want
to
be
a
duke
.
<EOS>
He
like
the
House
of
Commons
better
than
the
strawberry
leave
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
man
in
England
less
in
a
hurry
than
he
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
nice
that
be
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
not
in
a
hurry
either
,
 
be
I
,
mamma
?
"
say
the
little
future
Lord
Silverbridge
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
wicked
little
monkey
,
"
say
his
grand
-
uncle
,
kiss
him
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
Lady
Glencora
be
,
no
doubt
,
think
how
necessary
it
be
that
she
should
be
careful
to
see
that
thing
do
turn
out
in
the
manner
propose
,
 
so
that
people
who
have
wait
should
not
be
disappointed
;
and
the
Duke
be
perhaps
think
that
he
be
not
absolutely
bind
to
his
nephew
by
any
law
of
God
or
man
;
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
her
thought
be
injurious
to
the
prospect
of
that
handsome
bold
-
faced
little
boy
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
rise
to
take
her
leave
first
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
her
to
show
any
anxiety
to
force
the
Duke
out
of
the
lady
's
presence
.
<EOS>
if
the
Duke
be
resolve
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
,
nothing
that
she
could
do
would
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
but
she
think
that
this
little
inspection
may
possibly
be
of
service
,
and
that
her
uncle
's
ardour
would
be
cool
by
the
interruption
to
which
he
have
be
subject
.
<EOS>
so
she
go
,
and
immediately
afterwards
the
Duke
follow
her
.
<EOS>
the
interruption
have
,
at
any
rate
,
save
him
on
that
occasion
from
make
the
high
bid
for
the
pleasure
of
Madame
Goesler
's
company
at
Como
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
go
down
with
the
little
boy
in
his
hand
,
so
that
there
be
not
an
opportunity
for
a
single
word
of
interest
between
the
gentleman
and
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
,
when
she
be
alone
,
seat
herself
on
her
sofa
,
tuck
her
foot
up
under
her
as
though
she
be
seat
somewhere
in
the
East
,
push
her
ringlet
back
roughly
from
her
face
,
and
then
place
her
two
hand
to
her
side
so
that
her
thumb
rest
lightly
on
her
girdle
.
<EOS>
when
alone
with
something
weighty
on
her
mind
she
would
sit
in
this
form
for
the
hour
together
,
resolve
,
or
try
to
resolve
<EOS>
,
what
should
be
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
do
few
thing
without
much
thinking
,
and
though
she
walk
very
boldly
,
she
walk
warily
.
<EOS>
She
often
tell
herself
that
such
success
as
she
have
achieve
could
not
have
be
achieve
without
much
caution
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
be
ever
discontent
with
herself
,
tell
herself
that
all
that
she
have
do
be
nothing
,
or
bad
than
nothing
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
all
,
to
have
a
duke
and
to
have
lord
dine
with
her
,
to
dine
with
lord
or
with
a
duke
itself
,
if
life
be
dull
with
her
,
and
the
hour
hang
heavy
!
<EOS>
life
with
her
be
dull
,
and
the
hour
do
hang
heavy
.
<EOS>
and
what
if
she
catch
this
old
man
,
and
become
herself
a
duchess
,
 
catch
him
by
mean
of
his
weakness
,
to
the
inexpressible
dismay
of
all
those
who
be
bind
to
him
by
tie
of
blood
,
 
would
that
make
her
life
happier
,
or
her
hour
less
tedious
?
<EOS>
that
prospect
of
a
life
on
the
italian
lake
with
an
old
man
tie
to
her
side
be
not
so
charming
in
her
eye
as
it
be
in
those
of
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
be
she
to
succeed
,
and
to
be
blazon
forth
to
the
world
as
Duchess
of
Omnium
,
what
would
she
have
gain
?
  
<EOS>
She
perfectly
understand
the
motive
of
Lady
Glencora
's
visit
,
and
think
that
she
would
at
any
rate
gain
something
in
the
very
triumph
of
baffle
the
manoeuvre
of
so
clever
a
woman
.
<EOS>
let
Lady
Glencora
throw
her
ægis
before
the
Duke
,
and
it
would
be
something
to
carry
off
his
grace
from
beneath
the
protection
of
so
thick
a
shield
.
<EOS>
the
very
flavour
of
the
contest
be
pleasing
to
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
victory
gain
,
what
then
would
remain
to
her
?
<EOS>
money
she
have
already
<EOS>
;
position
,
too
,
she
have
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
be
free
as
air
,
and
should
it
suit
her
at
any
time
to
go
off
to
some
lake
of
Como
in
society
that
would
personally
be
more
agreeable
to
her
than
that
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
there
be
nothing
to
hinder
her
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
and
then
come
a
smile
over
her
face
,
 
but
the
sad
smile
,
 
as
she
think
of
one
with
whom
it
may
be
pleasant
to
look
at
the
colour
of
italian
sky
and
feel
the
softness
of
italian
breeze
.
<EOS>
in
feign
to
like
to
do
this
with
an
old
man
,
in
act
the
rapture
of
love
on
behalf
of
a
wear
-
out
duke
who
at
the
good
would
scarce
believe
in
her
acting
,
there
would
not
be
much
delight
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
yet
know
what
it
be
to
have
anything
of
the
pleasure
of
love
.
<EOS>
She
have
grow
,
as
she
often
tell
herself
,
to
be
a
hard
,
cautious
,
selfish
,
successful
woman
,
without
any
interference
or
assistance
from
such
pleasure
.
<EOS>
may
there
not
be
yet
time
leave
for
her
to
try
it
without
selfishness
,
 
with
an
absolute
devotion
of
self
,
 
if
only
she
could
find
the
right
companion
?
<EOS>
there
be
one
who
may
be
such
a
companion
,
but
the
Duke
of
Omnium
certainly
could
not
be
such
a
one
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
be
duchess
of
Omnium
!
<EOS>
after
all
,
success
in
this
world
be
everything
;
 
be
at
any
rate
the
only
thing
the
pleasure
of
which
will
endure
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
name
of
many
a
woman
write
in
a
black
list
within
Madame
Goesler
's
breast
,
 
write
there
because
of
scorn
,
because
of
reject
overture
,
because
of
deep
social
injury
;
and
Madame
Goesler
tell
herself
often
that
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
her
to
use
the
list
,
and
to
be
revenge
on
those
who
have
ill
-
use
and
scornfully
treat
her
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
readily
forgive
those
who
have
injure
her
.
<EOS>
as
Duchess
of
Omnium
she
think
that
probably
she
may
use
that
list
with
efficacy
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
treat
her
well
,
and
she
have
no
such
feeling
against
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
as
Duchess
of
Omnium
she
would
accept
Lady
Glencora
as
her
dear
friend
,
if
Lady
Glencora
would
admit
it
.
<EOS>
but
if
it
should
be
necessary
that
there
should
be
a
little
duel
between
them
,
as
to
which
of
them
should
take
the
Duke
in
hand
,
the
duel
must
of
course
be
fight
.
<EOS>
in
a
matter
so
important
,
one
woman
would
of
course
expect
no
false
sentiment
from
another
.
<EOS>
She
and
Lady
Glencora
would
understand
each
other
;
 
and
no
doubt
,
respect
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
she
would
sit
there
resolve
,
or
try
to
resolve
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
the
world
so
difficult
as
that
task
of
make
up
one
's
mind
.
<EOS>
who
be
there
that
have
not
long
that
the
power
and
privilege
of
selection
among
alternative
should
be
take
away
from
him
in
some
important
crisis
of
his
life
,
and
that
his
conduct
should
be
arrange
for
him
,
either
this
way
or
that
,
by
some
divine
power
if
it
be
possible
,
 
by
some
patriarchal
power
in
the
absence
of
divinity
,
 
or
by
chance
even
,
if
nothing
well
than
chance
could
be
find
to
do
it
?
<EOS>
but
no
one
dare
to
cast
the
die
,
and
to
go
honestly
by
the
hazard
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
the
actual
necessity
of
obey
the
die
,
before
even
the
die
can
be
of
any
use
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
when
Madame
Goesler
have
sit
there
for
an
hour
,
till
her
leg
be
tired
beneath
her
,
she
have
not
resolve
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
as
her
impulse
should
direct
her
when
the
important
moment
come
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
soul
on
earth
to
whom
she
could
go
for
counsel
,
and
when
she
ask
herself
for
counsel
,
the
counsel
would
not
come
.
  
<EOS>
two
day
afterwards
the
Duke
call
again
.
<EOS>
He
would
come
generally
on
a
Thursday
,
 
early
,
so
that
he
may
be
there
before
other
visitor
;
and
he
have
already
quite
learn
that
when
he
be
there
other
visitor
would
probably
be
refuse
admittance
.
<EOS>
how
Lady
Glencora
have
make
her
way
in
,
tell
the
servant
that
her
uncle
be
there
,
he
have
not
understand
.
<EOS>
that
visit
have
be
make
on
the
Thursday
,
but
now
he
come
on
the
Saturday
,
 
have
,
I
regret
to
say
,
send
down
some
early
fruit
from
his
own
hot
-
house
,
 
or
from
Covent
Garden
,
 
with
a
little
note
on
the
previous
day
.
<EOS>
the
grape
may
have
be
pretty
well
,
but
the
note
be
injudicious
.
<EOS>
there
be
three
line
about
the
grape
,
as
to
which
there
be
some
special
history
,
the
vine
have
be
bring
from
the
garden
of
some
villa
in
which
some
ill
-
use
queen
have
live
and
die
;
and
then
there
be
a
postscript
in
one
line
to
say
that
the
Duke
would
call
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
he
have
mean
to
add
this
when
he
begin
his
note
;
but
then
child
,
who
want
the
top
brick
,
want
it
so
badly
,
and
cry
for
it
so
perversely
!
  
<EOS>
of
course
Madame
Goesler
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
but
even
then
she
have
not
make
up
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
have
make
up
her
mind
only
to
this
,
 
that
he
should
be
make
to
speak
plainly
,
and
that
she
would
take
time
for
her
reply
.
<EOS>
not
even
with
such
a
gem
as
the
Duke
's
coronet
before
her
eye
,
would
she
jump
at
it
.
<EOS>
where
there
be
so
much
doubt
,
there
need
at
least
be
no
impatience
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
run
away
the
other
day
,
Duke
,
because
you
could
not
resist
the
charm
of
that
little
boy
,
"
she
say
,
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
dear
little
boy
,
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
that
,
"
he
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
Your
niece
carry
you
off
in
a
whirl
-
wind
.
<EOS>
She
be
come
and
go
,
take
you
with
her
,
in
half
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
disturb
me
when
I
be
think
of
something
,
"
say
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
thing
should
not
be
think
of
,
 
not
so
deeply
as
that
.
"
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
be
play
with
a
bunch
of
his
grape
now
,
eat
one
or
two
from
a
small
china
plate
which
have
stand
upon
the
table
,
and
he
think
that
he
have
never
see
a
woman
so
graceful
and
yet
so
natural
.
"
<EOS>
Will
you
not
eat
your
own
grape
with
me
?
<EOS>
They
be
delicious
;
 
flavour
with
the
poor
queen
's
sorrow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
,
know
that
it
do
not
suit
his
gastric
juice
to
have
to
deal
with
fruit
eat
at
odd
time
.
"
<EOS>
never
think
,
Duke
.
<EOS>
I
be
convinced
that
it
do
no
good
.
<EOS>
It
simply
mean
doubt
,
and
doubt
always
lead
to
error
.
<EOS>
the
safe
way
in
the
world
be
to
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
,
"
say
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
much
the
safe
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
have
not
sufficient
command
over
yourself
to
enable
you
to
sit
in
repose
,
always
quiet
,
never
commit
yourself
to
the
chance
of
any
danger
,
 
then
take
a
leap
in
the
dark
;
or
rather
many
leap
.
<EOS>
a
stumble
horse
regain
his
footing
by
persevere
in
his
onward
course
.
<EOS>
as
for
move
cautiously
,
that
I
detest
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
yet
one
must
think
;
 
for
instance
,
whether
one
will
succeed
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
take
that
for
grant
always
.
<EOS>
remember
,
I
do
not
recommend
motion
at
all
.
<EOS>
repose
be
my
idea
of
life
;
 
repose
and
grape
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
sit
for
a
while
silent
,
take
his
repose
as
far
as
the
outer
man
be
concern
,
look
at
his
top
brick
of
the
chimney
,
as
from
time
to
time
she
eat
one
of
his
grape
.
<EOS>
probably
she
do
not
eat
above
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
them
altogether
,
but
he
think
that
the
grape
must
have
be
make
for
the
woman
,
she
be
so
pretty
in
the
eating
of
them
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
necessary
that
he
should
speak
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
be
think
of
come
to
Como
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
that
I
never
think
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
want
an
answer
to
my
proposition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
answer
your
grace
on
that
question
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
put
down
the
grape
,
and
move
herself
on
her
chair
,
so
that
she
sit
with
her
face
turn
away
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
a
request
to
a
lady
may
be
make
twice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
grateful
,
know
how
far
it
be
from
your
intention
to
do
me
any
harm
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
somewhat
ashamed
of
my
warmth

the
other
day

<EOS>
but
still
there
can
be
but
one
answer
.
<EOS>
there
be
delight
which
a
woman
must
deny
herself
,
let
them
be
ever
so
delightful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
,
 
"
the
Duke
begin
,
and
then
he
stop
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
grace
be
say
that
you

,
 
"
  
"
Marie
,
a
man
at
my
age
do
not
like
to
be
deny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
man
like
to
be
deny
anything
by
a
woman
at
any
age
?
<EOS>
a
woman
who
deny
anything
be
call
cruel
at
once
,
 
even
though
it
be
her
very
soul
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
turn
round
upon
him
now
,
and
be
lean
forward
towards
him
from
her
chair
,
so
that
he
could
touch
her
if
he
put
out
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
hand
and
touch
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Marie
,
"
he
say
,
"
will
you
deny
me
if
I
ask
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
lord
;
how
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
there
be
many
a
trifle
I
would
deny
you

<EOS>
there
be
many
a
great
gift
I
would
give
you
willingly
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
the
great
gift
of
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
if
you
have
anything
to
say
,
you
must
say
it
plainly
.
<EOS>
there
never
be
a
woman
bad
than
I
be
at
the
reading
of
riddle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
you
endure
to
live
in
the
quietude
of
an
italian
lake
with
an
old
man
?
"
now
he
touch
her
again
,
and
have
take
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
lord
;
 
nor
with
a
young
one

for
all
my
day

<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
that
age
would
guide
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
the
Duke
rise
and
make
his
proposition
in
form
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Marie
,
you
know
that
I
love

why

be
that
I
at
my
age

I
can
not

<EOS>
"
  
"
so

"
so
sore

<EOS>
Marie
,
I
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
duke
of
Omnium
,
this
from
you
!
"
  
"
yes

from

<EOS>
My
coronet
be
at
your
foot

<EOS>
if
you
will
allow
me
to
raise
it
,
I
will
place
it
on

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
she
go
away
from
him
,
and
seat
herself
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
after
a
moment
or
two
he
follow
her
,
and
stand
with
his
arm
upon
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
give
me
an
answer

Marie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay

and
your

"
  
<EOS>
"
My

I
may
venture
to
please
myself
in
this
,
 
as

Will
you
not
answer
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
not
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
my
lord

<EOS>
think
how
high
be
the
position
you
offer
me
,
and
how
immense
be
the
change
you
propose
to
me
.
<EOS>
allow
me
two
day
,
and
I
will
answer
you
by
letter
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
fluttered
now
that
I
must
leave
you
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
come
to
her
,
take
her
hand
,
kiss
her
brow
,
and
open
the
door
for
her
.
   
<EOS>
another
Duel
 
<EOS>
It
happen
that
there
be
at
this
time
certain
matter
of
business
to
be
settle
between
the
Duke
of
Omnium
and
his
nephew
Mr.
Palliser
,
respect
which
the
latter
call
upon
his
uncle
on
the
morning
after
the
Duke
have
commit
himself
by
his
offer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
have
come
by
appointment
make
with
Mr.
Fothergill
,
the
Duke
's
man
of
business
,
and
have
expect
to
meet
Mr.
Fothergill
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fothergill
,
however
,
be
not
with
the
Duke
,
and
the
uncle
tell
the
nephew
that
the
business
have
be
postpone
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Palliser
ask
some
question
as
to
the
reason
of
such
postponement
,
not
mean
much
by
his
question
,
 
and
the
Duke
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
answer
him
,
mean
very
much
by
his
answer
.
"
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
Plantagenet
,
that
it
be
possible
that
I
may
marry
,
and
if
so
this
arrangement
would
not
suit
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
to
be
marry
?
"
ask
the
astonished
nephew
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
exactly
that
,
 
but
it
be
possible
that
I
may
do
so
.
<EOS>
since
I
propose
this
matter
to
Fothergill
,
I
have
be
think
over
it
,
and
I
have
change
my
mind
.
<EOS>
It
will
make
but
<EOS>
little
difference
to
you
;
and
after
all
you
be
a
far
rich
man
than
I
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
think
of
money
,
Duke
,
"
say
Plantagenet
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
what
then
be
you
think
?
"
  
"
simply
of
what
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
in
the
least
mean
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
could
not
hear
such
a
statement
from
you
without
some
surprise
.
<EOS>
whatever
you
do
<EOS>
I
hope
will
tend
to
make
you
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
much
pass
between
the
uncle
and
the
nephew
,
and
what
the
uncle
tell
to
the
nephew
,
the
nephew
of
course
tell
to
his
wife
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
with
her
again
,
yesterday
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
"
for
more
than
an
hour
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
be
half
the
morning
dress
himself
before
he
go
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
engage
to
her
,
or
he
would
have
tell
me
,
"
say
Plantagenet
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
would
,
but
there
be
no
knowing
.
<EOS>
at
the
present
moment
I
have
only
one
doubt
,
 
whether
to
act
upon
him
or
upon
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
that
you
can
do
good
by
go
to
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
we
will
see
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
the
woman
I
take
her
to
be
,
I
think
I
could
do
something
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
suppose
her
to
be
a
bad
woman
,
 
never
.
<EOS>
I
will
think
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lady
Glencora
leave
her
husband
,
and
do
not
consult
him
afterwards
as
to
the
course
she
would
pursue
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
budget
to
manage
,
and
his
speech
to
make
.
<EOS>
the
little
affair
of
the
Duke
and
Madame
Goesler
<EOS>
,
she
think
it
best
to
take
into
her
own
hand
without
any
assistance
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
fool
I
be
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
"
to
have
her
down
there
when
the
Duke
be
at
Matching
!
"
  
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
,
when
she
be
leave
alone
,
feel
that
now
indeed
she
must
make
up
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
have
ask
for
two
day
.
<EOS>
the
intervene
day
be
a
Sunday
,
and
on
the
Monday
she
must
send
her
answer
.
<EOS>
She
may
doubt
at
any
rate
for
this
one
night
,
 
the
Saturday
night
,
 
and
sit
playing
,
as
it
be
,
with
the
coronet
of
a
duchess
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
bear
the
daughter
of
a
small
country
attorney
,
and
now
a
duke
have
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
,
 
and
a
duke
who
be
acknowledge
to
stand
above
other
duke
!
<EOS>
nothing
at
any
rate
could
rob
her
of
that
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
whatever
resolution
she
may
form
at
last
,
she
have
by
her
own
resource
reach
a
point
of
success
in
remember
which
there
would
always
be
a
keen
gratification
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
much
to
be
duchess
of
omnium
;
but
it
would
be
something
also
to
have
refuse
to
be
a
Duchess
of
omnium
.
<EOS>
during
that
evening
,
that
night
,
and
the
next
morning
,
she
remain
play
with
the
coronet
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
what
good
could
any
sermon
do
her
while
that
bauble
be
dangle
before
her
eye
?
<EOS>
after
church
-
time
,
about
two
o'clock
,
Phineas
Finn
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
just
at
this
period
Phineas
would
come
to
her
often
;
 
sometimes
full
of
a
new
decision
to
forget
Violet
Effingham
altogether
,
at
other
mind
to
continue
his
siege
<EOS>
let
the
hope
of
success
be
ever
so
small
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
hear
that
Violet
and
Lord
Chiltern
have
in
truth
quarrel
,
and
be
of
course
anxious
to
be
advise
to
continue
the
siege
.
<EOS>
when
he
first
come
in
and
speak
a
word
or
two
,
in
which
there
be
no
reference
to
Violet
Effingham
,
there
come
upon
Madame
Goesler
a
strong
wish
to
decide
at
once
that
she
would
play
no
longer
with
the
coronet
,
that
the
gem
be
not
worth
the
cost
she
would
be
call
upon
to
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
world
better
for
her
than
the
coronet
,
 
if
only
it
may
be
have
.
<EOS>
but
within
ten
minute
he
have
tell
her
the
whole
tale
about
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
how
he
have
see
Violet
at
Lady
Baldock
's
,
 
and
how
there
may
yet
be
hope
for
him
.
<EOS>
what
would
she
advise
him
to
do
?
"
<EOS>
go
home
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
write
a
sonnet
to
her
eyebrow
.
<EOS>
see
if
that
will
have
any
effect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
well
!
<EOS>
It
be
natural
that
you
should
laugh
at
me
;
but
somehow
,
I
do
not
expect
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
what
I
mean
be
that
such
little
thing
seem
to
influence
this
violet
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
they
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
find
that
they
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
she
have
love
Lord
Chiltern
she
would
not
have
quarrel
with
him
for
a
few
word
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
love
you
,
she
would
not
have
accept
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
if
she
love
neither
of
you
,
she
should
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
be
lose
my
respect
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
say
that
,
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
I
respect
her
as
strongly
as
I
love
her
.
"
<EOS>
then
Madame
Goesler
almost
make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
have
the
coronet
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
substance
about
the
coronet
that
would
not
elude
her
grasp
.
  
<EOS>
late
that
afternoon
,
while
she
be
still
hesitate
,
there
come
another
caller
to
the
cottage
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
She
be
still
hesitate
,
feel
that
she
have
as
yet
another
night
before
her
.
<EOS>
Should
she
be
duchess
of
omnium
or
not
?
<EOS>
all
that
she
wish
to
be
,
she
could
not
be
;
 
but
to
be
<EOS>
duchess
of
omnium
be
within
her
reach
.
<EOS>
then
she
begin
to
ask
herself
various
question
.
<EOS>
Would
the
Queen
refuse
to
accept
her
in
her
new
rank
?
<EOS>
refuse
!
<EOS>
how
could
any
Queen
refuse
to
accept
her
?
<EOS>
She
have
not
do
aught
amiss
in
life
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
slur
on
her
name
;
no
stain
on
her
character
.
<EOS>
what
though
her
father
have
be
a
small
attorney
,
and
her
first
husband
a
Jew
banker
!
<EOS>
She
have
break
no
law
of
God
or
man
,
have
be
accuse
of
break
no
law
,
which
break
or
which
accusation
nee
stand
in
the
way
of
her
be
as
good
a
duchess
as
any
other
woman
!
<EOS>
She
be
sit
thinking
of
this
,
almost
angry
with
herself
at
the
awe
with
which
the
propose
rank
inspire
her
,
when
Lady
Glencora
be
announce
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madame
Goesler
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
"
I
be
very
glad
to
find
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
more
than
equally
so
,
to
be
find
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
,
smile
with
all
her
grace
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
have
be
with
you
since
I
see
you
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
;
 
more
than
once
if
I
remember
right
.
<EOS>
He
be
here
yesterday
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
come
often
to
you
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
so
often
as
I
would
wish
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
be
one
of
my
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
a
quick
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
 
a
quick
friendship
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
pause
for
some
moment
which
Madame
Goesler
be
determine
that
she
would
not
break
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
to
her
now
on
what
ground
Lady
Glencora
have
come
to
her
,
and
she
be
fully
minded
that
if
she
could
bear
the
full
light
of
the
god
himself
in
all
his
glory
,
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
scorch
by
any
reflected
heat
come
from
the
god
's
niece
.
<EOS>
She
think
she
could
endure
anything
that
Lady
Glencora
may
say
;
but
she
would
wait
and
hear
what
may
be
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Madame
Goesler
,
that
I
have
better
hurry
on
to
my
subject
at
once
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
almost
hesitating
as
she
speak
,
and
feel
that
the
colour
be
rush
up
to
her
cheek
and
cover
her
brow
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
what
I
have
to
say
will
be
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
shall
offend
you
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
do
not
mean
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
offend
at
nothing
,
Lady
Glencora
,
unless
I
think
that
you
mean
to
offend
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
protest
that
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
You
have
see
my
little
boy

after

have
no

<EOS>
the
letter
that
be
send
to
Brighton
 
Monday
morning
come
and
Madame
Goesler
have
as
yet
write
no
answer
to
the
Duke
of
Omnium

<EOS>
have
not
Lady
Glencora
go
to
Park
Lane
on
the
Sunday
afternoon
<EOS>
,
I
think
the
letter
would
have
be
write
on
that
day
;
but
,
whatever
may
have
be
the
effect
of
Lady
Glencora
's
visit
,
it
so
far
disturb
Madame
Goesler
as
to
keep
her
from
her
writing
-
table
.
<EOS>
there
be
yet
another
night
for
thought
,
and
then
the
letter
should
be
write
on
the
Monday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
when
Lady
Glencora
leave
Madame
Goesler
<EOS>
she
go
at
once
to
the
Duke
's
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
custom
to
see
her
husband
's
uncle
on
a
Sunday
,
and
she
would
most
frequently
find
him
just
at
this
hour
,
 
before
he
go
up
-
stair
to
dress
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
She
usually
take
her
boy
with
her
,
but
on
this
occasion
she
go
alone
.
<EOS>
She
have
try
what
she
could
do
with
Madame
Goesler
,
and
she
find
that
she
have
fail
.
<EOS>
She
must
now
make
her
attempt
upon
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
but
the
Duke
,
perhaps
anticipate
some
attack
of
the
kind
,
have
flee
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
his
grace
,
Barker
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
to
the
porter
.
<EOS>
"
We
do
not
know
,
your
ladyship

<EOS>
His
grace
go
away
yesterday
evening
with
nobody
but
Lapoule
.
<EOS>
"
Lapoule
be
the
Duke
's
french
valet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
could
only
return
home
and
consider
in
her
own
mind
what
battery
may
yet
be
bring
to
bear
upon
the
Duke
,
towards
stop
the
marriage
,
even
after
the
engagement
should
have
be
make
,
 
if
it
be
to
be
make
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
feel
that
such
battery
may
still
be
bring
up
as
would
not
improbably
have
an
effect
on
a
proud
,
weak
old
man
.
<EOS>
if
all
other
resource
fail
,
royalty
in
some
of
its
branch
may
be
induce
to
make
a
request
,
and
every
august
relation
in
the
peerage
should
interfere
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
no
doubt
may
persevere
and
marry
whom
he
please
,
 
if
he
be
strong
enough
.
<EOS>
but
it
require
much
personal
strength
,
 
that
stand
alone
against
the
well
-
arm
battery
of
all
one
's
friend
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
once
try
such
a
battle
on
her
own
behalf
,
and
have
fail
.
<EOS>
She
have
wish
to
be
imprudent
when
she
be
young
;
but
her
friend
have
be
too
strong
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
reduce
,
and
keep
in
order
,
and
make
to
run
in
a
groove
,
 
and
be
now
,
when
she
sit
look
at
her
little
boy
with
his
bold
face
,
almost
inclined
to
think
that
the
world
be
right
,
and
that
groove
be
good
.
<EOS>
but
if
she
have
be
control
when
she
be
young
,
so
ought
the
Duke
to
be
control
now
that
he
be
old
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
for
a
man
or
woman
to
boast
that
he
,
 
or
she
,
 
may
do
what
he
like
with
his
own
,
 
or
with
her
own
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
circumstance
in
which
such
self
-
action
be
ruinous
to
so
many
that
coercion
from
the
outside
become
absolutely
need
.
<EOS>
nobody
have
feel
the
injustice
of
such
coercion
when
apply
to
herself
more
sharply
than
have
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
live
to
acknowledge
that
such
coercion
may
be
proper
,
and
be
now
prepared
to
use
it
in
any
shape
in
which
it
may
be
make
available
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
for
Madame
Goesler
to
laugh
and
exclaim
,
"
Psha
!
"
<EOS>
when
Lady
Glencora
declare
her
real
trouble
.
<EOS>
but
should
it
ever
come
to
pass
that
a
black
-
browe
baby
with
a
yellow
skin
should
be
show
to
the
world
as
Lord
Silverbridge

Lady

She
have
begin
the

desire
one
thing
,
and
have
miss
it

<EOS>
She
have
suffer
much
,
and
have
then
reconcile
herself
to
other
hope
.
<EOS>
if
those
other
hope
be
also
to
be
cut
away
from
her
,
the
world
would
not
be
worth
a
pinch
of
snuff
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
have
flee
,
and
she
could
do
nothing
to
-
day
;
but
to
-
morrow
she
would
begin
with
her
battery
.

and
she
herself
have
do
the
mischief
!
<EOS>
She
have
invite
this
woman
down
to
Matching

<EOS>
Heaven
and
earth
!
 
<EOS>
that
such
a
man
as
the
Duke

be
such
a
fool

the
widow
of

Jew
banker

He

the
Duke

all
honour

all
peace

all
the

if
not
very
noble
in
itself

have
receive
the
praise
of
nobility

to
do
this
for
a
thin

black

browe

yellow
-
visaged
woman
with
ringlet
and
devil
's
eye
,
and
a
beard
on

manner

absolutely
ignorant

who
drink

find
her
way
into
society
by
her
art
and
perseverance
,
 
and
who
do
not
even
pretend
to
have
a
relation
in
the
world

<EOS>
that
such
a
one
should
have
influence
enough
to
intrude
herself
into
the
house
of
Omnium
,
and
blot
the
scutcheon
,
and
,
  
what
be
bad
of
all

perhaps
be
the
mother
of
future
duke

Lady
Glencora

in
her
anger

be
very
unjust

Madame
Goesler

think
all
evil
of
her

accuse
her
in
her
mind
of
every
crime
,
deny
her
all
charm
,
all
beauty

<EOS>
have
the
Duke
forget
himself
and
his
position
for
the
sake
of
some
fair
girl
with
a
pink
complexion
and
grey
eye

and
smooth
hair

and
a
father

have
forgive
it
better

It
may
be
that
Madame
Goesler
would
win
her
way
to
the
coronet

but
when
she
come
to
put
it
on

she
should
find
that
there
be
sharp
thorn
inside
the
lining
of
it

<EOS>
not
a
woman
worth

knowing
in
all
London
should
speak
to
her
;
 
nor
a
man
either
of
those
man
with
whom
a
Duchess
of
omnium
would
wish
to
hold
converse

She
should
find
her
husband
rate
as
a
dote
fool

herself
rate
as
a
scheming
female
adventuress

<EOS>
and
it
should
go
hard
with
Lady
Glencora

if
the
Duke
be
not
separate
from
his
new
Duchess
before
the
end
of
the
first
year

in

anger
Lady

the

<EOS>
Madame

sit
with

reach
.
<EOS>
She
do
do
so
;
and
wake
in
the
morning
with
her
mind
absolutely
in
doubt
.
<EOS>
when
she
walk
down
to
breakfast
,
all
doubt
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
the
time
have
come
when
it
be
necessary
that
she
should
resolve
,
and
while
her
maid
be
brush
her
hair
for
her
she
do
make
her
resolution
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
thing
it
be
to
be
a
great
lady
,
"
say
the
maid
,
who
may
probably
have
reflect
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
do
not
come
here
so
often
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
by
that
,
Lotta
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
woman
I
know
,
madame
,
talk
so
much
of
their
countess
,
and
ladyship
,
and
duchess
.
<EOS>
I
would
never
rest
till
I
have
a
title
in
this
country
,
if
I
be
a
lady
,
 
and
rich
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
can
the
countess
,
and
the
ladyship
,
and
the
duchess
do
as
they
please
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
madame
;
 
I
know
not
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
know
.
<EOS>
that
will
do
,
Lotta
.
<EOS>
now
leave
me
.
"
<EOS>
then
Madame
Goesler
have
make
up
her
mind
;
but
I
do
not
know
whether
that
doubt
as
to
have
her
own
way
have
much
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
as
the
wife
of
an
old
man
she
would
probably
have
have
much
of
her
own
way
.
<EOS>
immediately
after
breakfast
she
write
her
answer
to
the
Duke
,
which
be
as
follow
:
    
Park
Lane
,
Monday
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
duke
of
OMNIUM
,
  
<EOS>
I
find
so
great
a
difficulty
in
express
myself
to
your
grace
in
a
write
letter
,
that
since
you
leave
me
I
have
never
cease
to
wish
that
I
have
be
less
nervous
,
less
doubting
,
and
less
foolish
when
you
be
present
with
me
here
in
my
room
.
<EOS>
I
may
then
have
say
in
one
word
what
will
take
so
many
awkward
word
to
explain
.
  
<EOS>
great
as
be
the
honour
you
propose
to
confer
on
me
,
rich
as
be
the
gift
you
offer
me
,
I
can
not
accept
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
your
grace
's
wife
.
<EOS>
I
may
almost
say
that
I
know
it
be
so
when
you
part
from
me
;
but
the
surprise
of
the
situation
take
away
from
me
a
part
of
my
judgment
,
and
make
me
unable
to
answer
you
as
I
should
have
do
.
<EOS>
My
lord
,
the
truth
be
,
that
I
be
not
fit
to
be
the
wife
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
I
should
injure
you
;
and
though
I
should
raise
myself
in
name
,
I
should
injure
myself
in
character
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
think
,
because
I
say
this
,
that
there
be
any
reason
why
I
should
not
be
an
honest
man
's
wife
.
<EOS>
there
be
none
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
on
my
conscience
which
I
could
not
tell
you
,
 
or
to
another
man
;
nothing
that
I
need
fear
to
tell
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
lord
,
there
be
nothing
to
tell
<EOS>
but
this
,
 
that
I
be
not
fit
by
birth
and
position
to
be
the
wife
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
to
blush
for
me
,
and
that
no
man
shall
ever
have
to
do
on
my
account
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
own
that
I
have
be
ambitious
,
too
ambitious
,
and
have
be
please
to
think
that
one
so
exalted
as
you
be
,
one
whose
high
position
be
so
rife
in
the
eye
of
all
man
,
should
have
take
pleasure
in
my
company
.
<EOS>
I
will
confess
to
a
foolish
woman
's
silly
vanity
in
have
wish
to
be
know
to
be
the
friend
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
I
be
like
the
other
moth
that
flutter
near
the
light
and
have
their
wing
burn
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
wise
than
they
in
this
,
that
have
be
scorch
,
I
know
that
I
must
keep
my
distance
.
<EOS>
You
will
easily
believe
that
a
woman
,
such
as
I
be
,
do
not
refuse
to
ride
in
a
carriage
with
your
grace
's
arm
on
the
panel
without
a
regret
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
philosopher
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
despise
the
rich
thing
of
the
world
,
or
the
high
thing
.
<EOS>
accord
to
my
way
of
think
a
woman
ought
to
wish
to
be
duchess
of
omnium
;
 
but
she
ought
to
wish
also
to
be
able
to
carry
her
coronet
with
a
proper
grace
.
<EOS>
as
Madame
Goesler
I
can
live
,
even
among
my
superior
,
at
my
ease
.
<EOS>
as
your
grace
's
wife
,
I
should
be
easy
no
longer
;
  
nor
would
your
grace
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
think
perhaps
that
what
I
write
be
heartless
,
that
I
speak
altogether
of
your
rank
,
and
not
at
all
of
the
affection
you
have
show
me
,
or
of
that
which
I
may
possibly
bear
towards
you
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
when
the
first
flush
of
passion
be
over
in
early
youth
man
and
woman
should
strive
to
regulate
their
love
,
as
they
do
their
other
desire
,
by
their
reason
.
<EOS>
I
could
love
your
grace
,
fondly
,
as
your
wife
,
if
I
think
it
well
for
your
grace
or
for
myself
that
we
should
be
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
as
I
think
it
would
be
ill
for
both
of
us
,
I
will
restrain
that
feeling
,
and
remember
your
grace
ever
with
the
pure
feeling
of
true
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
close
this
letter
,
I
must
utter
a
word
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
in
the
kind
of
life
which
I
have
lead
as
a
widow
,
a
life
which
have
be
very
isolate
as
regard
true
fellowship
,
it
have
be
my
great
effort
to
obtain
the
good
opinion
of
those
among
whom
I
have
attempt
to
make
my
way
.
<EOS>
I
may
,
perhaps
,
own
to
you
now
that
I
have
have
many
difficulty
.
<EOS>
a
woman
who
be
alone
in
the
world
be
ever
regard
with
suspicion
.
<EOS>
in
this
country
a
woman
with
a
foreign
name
,
with
mean
derive
from
foreign
source
,
with
a
foreign
history
,
be
specially
suspect
.
<EOS>
I
have
strive
to
live
that
down
,
and
I
have
succeed
.
<EOS>
but
in
my
wildest
dream
I
never
dream
of
such
success
as
this
,
 
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
should
think
me
the
worthiest
of
the
worthy
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
that
I
be
not
ungrateful
,
 
that
I
never
will
be
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
and
I
trust
it
will
not
derogate
from
your
opinion
of
my
worth
,
that
I
have
know
what
be
due
to
your
grace
's
highness
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
the
honour
to
be
,
My
Lord
Duke
,
Your
most
obliged
and
faithful
servant
,
  
MARIE
MAX

<EOS>
"
how
many
unmarried
woman
in
England
be
there
would
do
the
same
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
to
herself
,
as
she
fold
the
paper
,
and
put
it
into
an
envelope
,
and
seal
the
cover
.
<EOS>
the
moment
that
the
letter
be
complete
she
send
it
off
,
as
she
be
direct
to
send
it
,
so
that
there
may
be
no
possibility
of
repentance
and
subsequent
hesitation
.
<EOS>
She
have
at
last
make
up
her
mind
,
and
she
would
stand
by
the
making
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
there
would
come
moment
in
which
she
would
deeply
regret
the
opportunity
that
she
have
lose
,
 
the
chance
of
greatness
that
she
have
fling
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
but
so
would
she
have
often
regret
it
,
also
,
have
she
accept
the
greatness
.
<EOS>
Her
position
be
one
in
which
there
must
be
regret
,
let
her
decision
have
be
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
decide
,
and
the
thing
be
do
.
<EOS>
She
would
still
be
free
,
 
Marie
Max
Goesler
,
 
unless
in
abandon
her
freedom
she
would
obtain
something
that
she
may
in
truth
prefer
to
it
.
<EOS>
when
the
letter
be
go
she
sit
disconsolate
,
at
the
window
of
an
up
-
stair
room
in
which
she
have
write
,
think
much
of
the
coronet
,
much
of
the
name
,
much
of
the
rank
,
much
of
that
position
in
society
which
she
have
flatter
herself
she
may
have
win
for
herself
as
Duchess
of
Omnium
by
her
beauty
,
her
grace
,
and
her
wit
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
be
simply
her
ambition
to
be
a
duchess
,
without
further
aim
or
object
.
<EOS>
She
have
fancy
that
she
may
have
be
such
a
duchess
as
there
be
never
another
,
so
that
her
fame
may
have
be
great
throughout
Europe
,
as
a
woman
charm
at
all
point
.
<EOS>
and
she
would
have
have
friend
,
then
,
 
real
friend
,
and
would
not
have
live
alone
as
it
be
now
her
fate
to
do
.
<EOS>
and
she
would
have
love
her
ducal
husband
,
old
though
he
be
,
and
stiff
with
pomp
and
ceremony
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
love
him
,
and
do
her
good
to
add
something
of
brightness
to
his
life
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
true
that
there
be
one
whom
she
love
better
;
but
of
what
avail
be
it
to
love
a
man
who
,
when
he
come
to
her
,
would
speak
to
her
of
nothing
but
of
the
charm
which
he
find
in
another
woman
!
  
<EOS>
She
have
be
sit
thus
at
her
window
,
with
a
book
in
her
hand
,
at
which
she
never
look
,
gaze
over
the
park
which
be
now
beautiful
with
its
May
verdure
,
when
on
a
sudden
a
thought
strike
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
have
come
to
her
,
try
to
enlist
her
sympathy
for
the
little
heir
,
behaving
,
indeed
,
not
very
well
,
as
Madame
Goesler
have
think
,
but
still
with
an
earnest
purpose
which
be
in
itself
good
.
<EOS>
She
would
write
to
Lady
Glencora
and
put
her
out
of
her
misery
.
<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
some
feeling
of
triumph
in
her
mind
as
she
return
to
the
desk
from
which
her
epistle
have
be
send
to
the
Duke
;
 
not
of
that
triumph
which
would
have
find
its
gratification
in
boasting
of
the
offer
that
have
be
make
to
her
,
but
arise
from
a
feeling
that
she
could
now
show
the
proud
mother
of
the
bold
-
face
boy
that
though
she
would
not
pledge
herself
to
any
woman
as
to
what
she
may
do
or
not
do
,
she
be
nevertheless
capable
of
resist
such
a
temptation
as
would
have
be
irresistible
to
many
.
<EOS>
of
the
Duke
's
offer
to
her
she
would
have
speak
to
no
human
being
,
have
not
this
woman
show
that
the
Duke
's
purpose
be
know
at
least
to
her
,
and
now
,
in
her
letter
,
she
would
write
no
plain
word
of
that
offer
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
state
,
in
word
intelligible
to
any
one
who
may
read
,
that
the
Duke
have
offer
her
his
hand
and
his
coronet
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
write
so
that
Lady
Glencora
should
understand
her
.
<EOS>
and
she
would
be
careful
that
there
should
be
no
word
in
the
letter
to
make
Lady
Glencora
think
that
she
suppose
herself
to
be
unfit
for
the
rank
offer
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
very
humble
in
what
she
have
write
to
the
Duke
,
but
she
would
not
be
at
all
humble
in
what
she
be
about
to
write
to
the
mother
of
the
bold
-
face
boy
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
letter
when
it
be
write
:
    
my
dear
lady
glencora
,
  
<EOS>
I
venture
to
send
you
a
line
to
put
you
out
of
your
misery
;
 
for
you
<EOS>
be
very
miserable
when
you
be
so
good
as
to
come
here
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Your
dear
little
boy
be
safe
from
me
;
 
and
,
what
be
more
to
the
purpose
,
so
be
you
and
your
husband
,
 
and
your
uncle
,
whom
,
in
truth
,
I
love
.
<EOS>
You
ask
me
a
downright
question
which
I
do
not
then
choose
to
answer
by
a
downright
answer
.
<EOS>
the
downright
answer
be
not
at
that
time
due
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
have
since
be
give
,
and
as
I
like
you
too
well
to
wish
you
to
be
in
torment
<EOS>
,
I
send
you
a
line
to
say
that
I
shall
never
be
in
the
way
of
you
or
your
boy
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
dear
Lady
Glencora
,
one
word
more
.
<EOS>
Should
it
ever
again
appear
to
you
to
be
necessary
to
use
your
zeal
for
the
protection
of
your
husband
or
your
child
,
do
not
endeavour
to
dissuade
a
woman
by
try
to
make
her
think
that
she
,
by
her
alliance
,
would
bring
degradation
into
any
house
,
or
to
any
man
.
<EOS>
if
there
could
have
be
an
argument
powerful
with
me
,
to
make
me
do
that
which
you
wish
to
prevent
,
it
be
the
argument
which
you
use
.
<EOS>
but
my
own
comfort
,
and
the
happiness
of
another
person
whom
I
value
almost
as
much
as
myself
,
be
too
important
to
be
sacrifice
even
to
a
woman
's
revenge
.
<EOS>
I
take
mine
by
write
to
you
and
tell
you
that
I
be
well
and
more
rational
and
wise
than
you
take
me
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
if
,
after
this
,
you
choose
to
be
on
good
term
with
me
,
I
shall
be
happy
to
be
your
friend
.
<EOS>
I
shall
want
no
further
revenge
.
<EOS>
You
owe
me
some
little
apology
;
but
whether
you
make
it
or
not
,
I
will
be
content
,
and
will
never
do
more
than
ask
whether
your
darling
's
prospect
be
still
safe
.
<EOS>
there
be
more
woman
than
one
in
the
world
,
you
know
,
and
you
must
not
consider
yourself
to
be
out
of
the
wood
because
you
have
escape
from
a
single
danger
.
<EOS>
if
there
arise
another
,
come
to
me
,
and
we
will
consult
together
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
Lady
Glencora

always
sincerely

MARIE

G.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
thing
or
two
besides
which

but
she
refrain

her
letter

on

to
be
annoy
and
angry
,
but
her
anger
be
with
herself
rather
than
with
her
correspondent
.
<EOS>
ever
since
her
last
interview
with
the
woman
whom
she
have
fear
,
she
have
be
conscious
of
have
be
indiscreet
.
<EOS>
all
her
feeling
have
be
too
violent
,
and
it
may
well
have
be
that
she
should
have
drive
this
woman
to
do
the
very
thing
that
she
be
so
anxious
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
"
You
owe
me
some
little
apology
,
"
Madame
Goesler
have
say
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
 
and
she
would
apologise
.
<EOS>
undue
pride
be
not
a
part
of
Lady
Glencora
's
character
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
be
not
enough
of
pride
in
her
composition
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
quite
ready
to
hate
this
woman
,
and
to
fight
her
on
every
point
as
long
as
the
danger
exist
;
but
she
be
equally
willing
to
take
the
woman
to
her
heart
now
that
the
danger
be
over
.
<EOS>
apologise
!
<EOS>
of
course
she
would
apologise
.
<EOS>
and
she
would
make
a
friend
of
the
woman
if
the
woman
wish
it
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
not
have
the
woman
and
the
Duke
at
match
together
again
,
l
,
after
all
,
there
may
be
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
show
Madame
Goesler
's
letter
to
her
husband
,
or
tell
him
anything
of
the
relief
she
have
receive
.
<EOS>
He
have
care
but
little
for
the
danger
,
think
more
of
his
budget
than
of
the
danger
;
and
would
be
sufficiently
at
his
ease
if
he
hear
no
more
rumour
of
his
uncle
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
go
to
Park
Lane
early
on
the
Tuesday
morning
,
but
she
do
not
take
her
boy
with
her

<EOS>
She
understand
that
Madame
Goesler
may
perhaps
indulge
in
a
little
gentle
raillery
at
the
child
's
expense
,
and
the
mother
feel
that
this
may
be
bear
the
more
easily
if
the
child
be
not
present

"

They
part

Lady

be
still
of
opinion
that
if
the
lady
and
the
Duke
be
to
be
bring
together
at
Matching
,
or
elsewhere
,
there
may
still
be
danger

<EOS>
show
how
the
Duke
stand
His
ground
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
<EOS>
the
barrister
,
who
have
give
so
many
lecture
to
our
friend
Phineas
Finn
,
lecture
that
ought
to
have
be
useful
,
be
now
himself
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
have
reach
it
in
the
legitimate
course
of
his
profession
.
<EOS>
at
a
certain
point
of
his
career
,
suppose
his
career
to
have
be
sufficiently
prosperous
,
it
become
natural
to
a
barrister
to
stand
for
some
constituency
,
and
natural
for
him
also
to
form
his
politic
at
that
period
of
his
life
with
a
view
to
his
further
advancement
,
look
,
as
he
do
so
,
carefully
at
the
age
and
standing
of
the
various
candidate
for
high
legal
office
.
<EOS>
when
a
man
have
work
as
Mr.
Low
have
work
,
he
begin
to
regard
the
bench
wistfully
,
and
to
calculate
the
profit
of
a
two
year
'
run
in
the
Attorney
-
Generalship
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
way
of
the
profession
,
and
thus
a
proper
and
sufficient
number
of
real
barrister
find
its
way
into
the
House
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
have
be
angry
with
Phineas
because
he
,
be
a
barrister
,
have
climb
into
it
after
another
fashion
,
have
take
up
politic
,
not
in
the
proper
way
as
an
assistance
to
his
great
profession
,
but
as
a
profession
in
itself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
have
be
quite
sure
that
his
pupil
have
be
wrong
in
this
,
and
that
the
error
would
at
last
show
itself
,
to
his
pupil
's
cost
.
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Low
have
be
more
sure
than
Mr.
Low
,
have
not
unnaturally
be
jealous
that
a
young
whipper
-
snapper
of
a
pupil
,
 
as
she
have
once
call
Phineas
,
 
should
become
a
Parliament
man
before
her
husband
,
who
have
work
his
way
up
gallantly
,
in
the
usual
course
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
give
way
a
jot
even
now
,
 
not
even
when
she
hear
that
Phineas
be
go
to
marry
this
and
that
heiress
.
<EOS>
for
at
this
period
of
his
life
<EOS>
such
rumour
be
afloat
about
him
,
originate
probably
in
his
hope
as
to
Violet
Effingham
and
his
intimacy
with
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
heiress
!
"
say
Mrs.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
in
heiress
'
money
till
I
see
it
.
<EOS>
three
or
four
hundred
a
year
be
a
great
fortune
for
a
woman
,
but
it
do
not
go
far
in
keep
a
house
in
London
.
<EOS>
and
when
a
woman
have
get
a
little
money
she
generally
know
how
to
spend
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
begin
at
the
wrong
end
,
and
they
who
do
that
never
get
themselves
right
at
the
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
time
Phineas
have
become
somewhat
of
a
fine
gentleman
,
which
make
Mrs.
Low
the
more
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
show
himself
willing
enough
to
go
to
Mrs.
Low
's
house
,
but
when
there
he
seem
to
her
to
give
himself
air
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
she
be
unjust
to
him
,
and
that
it
be
natural
that
he
should
not
bear
himself
beneath
her
remark
exactly
as
he
have
do
when
he
be
nobody
.
<EOS>
He
have
certainly
be
very
successful
.
<EOS>
He
be
always
listen
to
in
the
House
,
and
rarely
speak
except
on
subject
which
belong
to
him
,
or
have
be
allot
to
him
as
part
of
his
business
.
<EOS>
He
live
quite
at
his
ease
with
people
of
the
high
rank
,
 
and
those
of
his
own
mode
of
life
who
dislike
him
do
so
simply
because
they
regard
with
envy
his
too
rapid
rise
.
<EOS>
He
ride
upon
a
pretty
horse
in
the
park
,
and
be
careful
in
his
dress
,
and
have
about
him
an
air
of
comfortable
wealth
which
Mrs.
Low
think
he
have
not
earn
.
<EOS>
when
her
husband
tell
her
of
his
sufficient
salary
,
she
would
shake
her
head
and
express
her
opinion
that
a
good
time
be
come
.
<EOS>
by
which
she
perhaps
mean
to
imply
a
belief
that
a
time
be
come
in
which
her
husband
would
have
a
salary
much
better
than
that
now
enjoy
by
Phineas
,
and
much
more
likely
to
be
permanent
.
<EOS>
the
radical
be
not
to
have
office
for
ever
,
and
when
they
be
go
,
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
he
save
a
shilling
,
"
say
Mrs.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
how
can
he
,
keep
a
horse
in
the
park
,
and
hunt
down
in
the
country
,
and
live
with
lord
?
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
he
be
not
find
to
be
over
head
and
ear
in
debt
when
thing
come
to
be
look
into
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Low
be
fond
of
an
assure
prosperity
,
of
money
in
the
fund
,
and
be
proud
to
think
that
her
husband
live
in
a
house
of
his
own

what
we
pay

Mr.
Bunce
,
"
she
once
say
to
that
gallant
Radical
,
"
and
that
come
of
beginning
at
the
right
end
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
have
nothing
when
he
begin
the
world
,
and
I
have
just
what
make
us
decent
the
day
we
marry
.
<EOS>
but
he
begin
at
the
right
end
,
and
let
thing
go
as
they
may
he
can
not
get
a
fall
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunce
and
Mrs.
Low
,
though
they
differ
much
in
politic
,
sympathise
in
reference
to
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
believe
,
madam
,
in
nobody
do
any
good
by
get
a
place
,
"
say
Mr.
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
do
not
mean
judge
and
them
like
,
which
must
be
.
<EOS>
but
when
a
young
man
have
ever
so
much
a
year
for
sit
in
a
big
room
down
at
Whitehall
,
and
read
a
newspaper
with
his
foot
up
on
a
chair
,
I
do
not
think
it
honest
,
whether
he
be
a
Parliament
man
or
whether
he
be
not
.
"
<EOS>
Whence
Mr.
Bunce
have
get
his
notion
as
to
the
way
in
which
official
at
Whitehall
pass
their
time
,
I
can
not
say
;
but
his
notion
be
very
common
notion
.
<EOS>
the
british
world
at
large
be
slow
to
believe
that
the
great
british
housekeeper
keep
no
more
cat
than
what
kill
mouse
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
,
who
be
now
frequently
in
the
habit
of
see
Phineas
at
the
House
,
have
somewhat
change
his
opinion
,
and
be
not
so
eager
in
condemn
Phineas
as
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
have
begin
to
think
that
perhaps
Phineas
have
show
some
knowledge
of
his
own
aptitude
in
the
career
which
he
have
seek
,
and
be
aware
,
at
any
rate
,
that
his
late
pupil
be
somebody
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
a
man
will
almost
always
respect
him
whom
those
around
him
respect
,
and
will
generally
look
up
to
one
who
be
evidently
above
himself
in
his
own
daily
avocation
.
<EOS>
now
Phineas
be
certainly
above
Mr.
Low
in
parliamentary
reputation
.
<EOS>
He
sit
on
a
front
bench
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
leader
of
party
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
home
amidst
the
form
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
He
enjoy
something
of
the
prestige
of
Government
power
.
<EOS>
and
he
walk
about
familiarly
with
the
son
of
duke
and
the
brother
of
earl
in
a
manner
which
have
its
effect
even
on
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
see
these
thing
Mr.
Low
could
not
maintain
his
old
opinion
as
stoutly
as
do
his
wife
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
a
privilege
to
Mr.
Low
to
be
intimate
with
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
how
then
could
he
look
down
upon
him
?
  
<EOS>
He
be
surprised
,
therefore
,
one
day
when
Phineas
discuss
the
matter
with
him
fully
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
ask
him
what
would
be
his
chance
of
success
if
even
now
he
be
to
give
up
politic
and
take
to
the
Bar
as
the

You

uphill
work

as
a
matter
of

Mr.

it
may

I

no

not

nothing

man

<EOS>
You
would
have
to

down

that

the

<EOS>
"
the

be
very
arbitrary

Phineas

<EOS>
"
yes
;

there
would
be
this
against
you
 
that
it
be
so
difficult
for
a
man
to
go
back
to
the
verdure

malleability
of

escape

You

difficult

other
would

yes

why
so

I

well

yes

<EOS>
I
can
understand
that

I

when
I
hear
those
fellow
below

their

just
what

it

me
furious

there
be

He
try
office
for
a
couple

have
break
away

now
,
by
George

there
be
no

they
think
so
much
of
as
they
do
of

the

be
a

he
not

I
suppose
so

of
course
he
be
,
because
he
live

He
never
earn
anything

<EOS>
His

money

My

that
make
all
the

when

can
please
himself

<EOS>
do
you
marry
a

with
money

and
then
you
may
kick
up
your
heel

do
as
you
like
about
the
Colonial
Office

<EOS>
when
a

he
must
fit
himself
to
the
circumstance

a

black
white

tell
him

old
fellow

I
shall
pull
through

I

do
not

tell
your

all
this
,

she
will
be
hard
upon
me
than
ever

she
see
me

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
that
Mr.
Low
begin
to
think
that
his
wife
's
judgment
in
this
matter
have
be
well
than
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
Robson
could
do
as
he
like
because
he
have
marry
a
woman
with
money
.
<EOS>
Phineas
tell
himself
that
that
game
be
also
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
may
marry
money
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
have
money
;
 
quite
enough
to
make
him
independent
be
he
marry
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
Madame
Goesler
have
money
;
 
plenty
of
money
.
<EOS>
and
an
idea
have
begin
to
creep
upon
him
that
Madame
Goesler
would
take
him
be
he
to
offer
himself
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
sooner
go
back
to
the
Bar
as
the
low
pupil
,
sooner
clean
boot
for
barrister
,
 
<EOS>
so
he
tell
himself
,
 
than
marry
a
woman
simply
because
she
have
money
,
than
marry
any
other
woman
as
long
as
there
be
a
chance
that
Violet
may
be
win
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
very
desirable
that
he
should
know
whether
Violet
may
be
win
or
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
July
,
and
everybody
would
be
go
in
another
month
.
<EOS>
before
August
would
be
over
<EOS>
he
be
to
start
for
Ireland
with
Mr.
Monk
,
and
he
know
that
word
would
be
speak
in
Ireland
which
may
make
it
indispensable
for
him
to
be
,
at
any
rate
,
able
to
throw
up
his
office
.
<EOS>
in
these
day
he
become
more
anxious
than
he
use
to
be
about
Miss
Effingham
's
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
never
speak
as
yet
to
Lord
Brentford
since
the
day
on
which
the
Earl
have
quarrel
with
him
,
nor
have
he
ever
be
at
the
house
in
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
he
meet
occasionally
,
and
have
always
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
gracious
to
him
,
but
there
have
be
no
renewal
of
their
intimacy
.
<EOS>
Rumours
have
reach
him
that
thing
be
go
badly
with
her
and
her
husband
;
but
when
man
repeat
such
rumour
in
his
presence
,
he
say
little
or
nothing
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
him
,
at
any
rate
,
to
speak
of
Lady
Laura
's
unhappiness
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
he
have
see
once
or
twice
during
the
last
month
,
and
they
have
meet
cordially
as
friend
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
could
ask
no
question
from
Lord
Chiltern
as
to
Violet
;
but
he
do
learn
that
his
friend
have
again
patch
up
some
reconciliation
with
his
father
.

He
have
quarrel
with
me

you
know

Phineas

<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
,
but
what
could
I
do

<EOS>
as
thing
go
,
I
be
oblige
to
tell
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
suppose
for
a
moment
that
I
be
blame
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
no
doubt
,
much
better
that
he
should
know
it
all
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
it
can
not
make
much
difference
to
you
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
one
do
not
like
to
quarrel
with
those
who
have
be
kind
to
one
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
not
your
doing
.
<EOS>
He
will
come
right
again
after
a
time
.
<EOS>
when
I
can
get
my
own
affair
settle
,
you
may
be
sure
I
will
do
my
good
to
bring
him
round
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
reason
you
never
see
Laura
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
reason
that
everything
go
awry
?
"
say
Phineas
,
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
mention
your
name
to
Kennedy
the
other
day
,
he
look
as
black
as
thunder
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
odd
that
any
one
should
quarrel
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
stand
him
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
I
sometimes
think
that
Laura
will
have
to
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
then
there
will
be
another
mess
in
the
family
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
very
well
as
come
from
Lord
Chiltern
;
but
there
be
no
word
about
Violet
,
and
Phineas
do
not
know
how
to
get
a
word
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
could
have
tell
him
everything
,
but
he
could
not
go
to
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
do
go
to
Lady
Baldock
's
house
as
often
as
he
think
he
could
with
propriety
,
and
occasionally
he
see
Violet
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
do
no
more
than
see
her
,
and
the
day
and
week
be
pass
by
,
and
the
time
be
come
in
which
he
would
have
to
go
away
,
and
be
with
her
no
more
.
<EOS>
the
end
of
the
season
,
which
be
always
to
other
man
,
 
to
other
work
man
such
as
our
hero
,
 
a
period
of
pleasurable
anticipation
,
to
him
be
a
time
of
sadness
,
in
which
he
feel
that
he
be
not
exactly
like
to
,
or
even
equal
to
,
the
man
with
whom
he
live
in
London
.
<EOS>
in
the
old
day
,
in
which
he
be
allow
to
go
to
Loughlinter
or
to
Saulsby
,
when
all
man
and
woman
be
go
to
their
Loughlinters
and
their
saulsbys
,
it
be
very
well
with
him
;
but
there
be
something
melancholy
to
him
in
his
yearly
journey
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
He
love
his
father
and
mother
and
sister
as
well
as
do
other
man
;
but
there
be
a
falling
off
in
the
manner
of
his
life
which
make
him
feel
that
he
have
be
in
some
sort
out
of
his
own
element
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
like
to
have
shoot
grouse
at
Loughlinter
,
or
pheasant
at
Saulsby
,
or
to
have
hunt
down
at
Willingford
,
 
or
well
still
,
to
have
make
love
to
Violet
Effingham
wherever
Violet
Effingham
may
have
place
herself
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
be
closed
to
him
now
;
and
there
would
be
nothing
for
him
but
to
remain
at
Killaloe
,
or
to
return
to
his
work
in
Downing
Street
,
from
August
to
February
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
,
indeed
,
be
go
with
him
for
a
few
week
;
but
even
this
association
do
not
make
up
for
that
sort
of
society
which
he
would
have
prefer
.
  
<EOS>
the
session
go
on
very
quietly
.
<EOS>
the
question
of
the
Irish
Reform
Bill
be
postpone
till
the
next
year
,
which
be
a
great
thing
gain
.
<EOS>
He
carry
his
bill
about
the
Canada
Railway
,
with
sundry
other
small
bill
appertain
to
it
,
through
the
House
in
a
manner
which
redound
infinitely
to
his
credit
.
<EOS>
there
be
just
enough
of
opposition
to
give
a
zest
to
the
work
,
and
to
make
the
affair
conspicuous
among
the
affair
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
as
his
chief
be
in
the
other
house
,
the
work
fall
altogether
into
his
hand
,
so
that
he
come
to
be
conspicuous
among
Under
-
Secretaries
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
he
say
a
word
to
any
leader
of
his
party
about
other
matter
,
 
about
Irish
Tenant
-
right
,
for
instance
,
which
be
begin
to
loom
very
large
,
that
he
find
himself
to
be
snub
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
room
for
action
this
year
in
reference
to
Irish
Tenant
-
right
,
and
therefore
any
deep
consideration
of
that
discomfort
may
be
legitimately
postpone
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
by
chance
open
his
mouth
on
the
subject
to
Mr.
Monk
,
even
Mr.
Monk
discourage
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
early
day
of
July
,
when
the
weather
be
very
hot
,
and
people
be
begin
to
complain
of
the
Thames
,
and
member
be
become
thirsty
after
grouse
,
and
the
remain
day
of
parliamentary
work
be
be
count
up
<EOS>
,
there
come
to
him
news
,
 
news
that
be
soon
know
throughout
the
fashionable
world
,
 
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
go
to
give
a
garden
party
at
a
certain
villa
residence
on
the
bank
of
the
Thames
above
Richmond
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
such
a
garden
party
as
have
never
be
see
before
.
<EOS>
and
it
would
be
the
more
remarkable
because
the
Duke
have
never
be
know
to
do
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
the
villa
be
call
the
Horns
,
and
have
,
indeed
,
be
give
by
the
Duke
to
Lady
Glencora
on
her
marriage
;
but
the
party
be
to
be
the
Duke
's
party
,
and
the
Horns
,
with
all
its
garden
,
conservatory
,
lawn
,
shrubbery
,
paddock
,
boat
-
house
,
and
boat
,
be
to
be
make
bright
and
beautiful
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
score
of
workman
be
about
the
place
through
the
three
first
week
of
July
.
<EOS>
the
world
at
large
do
not
at
all
know
why
the
Duke
be
do
so
unwonted
a
thing
,
 
why
he
should
undertake
so
new
a
trouble
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Glencora
know
,
and
Madame
Goesler
shrewdly
guess
,
the
riddle
.
<EOS>
when
Madame
Goesler
's
unexpected
refusal
have
reach
his
grace
,
he
feel
that
he
must
either
accept
the
lady
's
refusal
,
or
persevere
.
<EOS>
after
a
day
's
consideration
,
he
resolve
that
he
would
accept
it
.
<EOS>
the
top
brick
of
the
chimney
be
very
desirable
;
but
perhaps
it
may
be
well
that
he
should
endeavour
to
live
without
it
.
<EOS>
then
,
accept
this
refusal
,
he
must
either
stand
his
ground
and
bear
the
blow
,
 
or
he
must
run
away
to
that
villa
at
Como
,
or
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
the
running
away
seem
to
him
at
first
to
be
the
well
,
or
at
least
the
more
pleasant
,
course
;
but
at
last
he
determine
that
he
would
stand
his
ground
and
bear
the
blow
.
<EOS>
therefore
he
give
his
garden
party
at
the
Horns
.
  
<EOS>
who
be
to
be
invite
?
<EOS>
before
the
first
week
in
July
be
over
,
many
a
bosom
in
London
be
flutter
with
anxiety
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
,
in
give
his
short
word
of
instruction
to
Lady
Glencora
,
make
her
understand
that
he
would
wish
her
to
be
particular
in
her
invitation
.
<EOS>
Her
Royal
Highness
the
Princess
,
and
his
Royal
Highness
the
Prince
,
have
both
be
so
gracious
as
to
say
that
they
would
honour
his
fête
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
himself
have
make
out
a
short
list
,
with
not
more
than
a
dozen
name
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
employ
to
select
the
real
crowd
,
 
the
five
hundred
out
of
the
ten
thousand
who
be
to
be
bless
.
<EOS>
on
the
Duke
's
own
private
list
be
the
name
of
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
understand
it
all
.
<EOS>
when
Madame
Goesler
get
her
card
,
she
think
that
she
understand
it
too
.
<EOS>
and
she
think
also
that
the
Duke
be
behave
in
a
gallant
way
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
no
doubt
,
much
difficulty
about
the
invitation
,
and
a
considerable
amount
of
ill
-
will
be
create
.
<EOS>
and
they
who
consider
themselves
entitle
to
be
ask
,
and
be
not
ask
,
be
full
of
wrath
against
their
more
fortunate
friend
,
instead
of
be
angry
with
the
Duke
or
with
Lady
Glencora
,
who
have
neglect
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
soon
know
that
Lady
Glencora
be
the
real
dispenser
of
the
favour
,
and
I
fancy
that
her
ladyship
be
tired
of
her
task
before
it
be
complete
.
<EOS>
the
party
be
to
take
place
on
Wednesday
,
the
27th
of
July
,
and
before
the
day
have
come
,
man
and
woman
have
become
so
hardy
in
the
combat
that
personal
application
be
make
with
unflinching
importunity
;
and
letter
be
write
to
Lady
Glencora
put
forward
this
claim
and
that
claim
with
a
piteous
clamour
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
that
be
too
bad
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
to
her
particular
friend
,
Mrs.
Grey
,
when
a
letter
come
from
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
state
all
that
her
husband
have
ever
do
towards
support
Mr.
Palliser
in
Parliament
,
 
and
all
that
he
ever
would
do
.
"
<EOS>
She
shall
not
have
it
,
even
though
she
could
put
Plantagenet
into
a
minority
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bonteen
do
not
get
a
card
;
and
when
she
hear
that
Phineas
Finn
have
receive
one
,
her
wrath
against
Phineas
be
very
great
.
<EOS>
He
be
"
an
irish
adventurer
,
"
and
she
regret
deeply
that
Mr.
Bonteen
have
ever
interest
himself
in
bring
such
an
upstart
forward
in
the
world
of
politic
.
<EOS>
but
as
Mr.
Bonteen
never
have
do
anything
towards
bring
Phineas
forward
,
there
be
not
much
cause
for
regret
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
however
,
get
his
card
,
and
,
of
course
,
accept
the
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
the
ground
be
open
at
four
.
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
an
early
dinner
out
in
tent
at
five
;
and
after
dinner
man
and
woman
be
to
walk
about
,
or
dance
,
or
make
love
 
or
hay
,
as
suit
them
.
<EOS>
the
haycock
,
however
,
be
ready
prepared
,
while
it
be
expect
that
they
should
bring
the
love
with
them
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
know
that
he
should
meet
Violet
Effingham
,
take
a
great
deal
with
him
ready
make
.
  
<EOS>
for
an
hour
and
a
half
Lady
Glencora
keep
her
position
in
a
saloon
through
which
the
guest
pass
to
the
ground
,
and
to
every
comer
she
impart
the
information
that
the
Duke
be
on
the
lawn
;
 
to
every
comer
but
one
.
<EOS>
to
Madame
Goesler
<EOS>
she
say
no
such
word
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
glad
to
see
you
,
my
dear
,
"
she
say
,
as
she
press
her
friend
's
hand
:
"
if
I
be
not
kill
by
this
work
,
I
will
make
you
out
again
by
-
and
-
by
.
"
<EOS>
then
Madame
Goesler
pass
on
,
and
soon
find
herself
amidst
a
throng
of
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
minute
she
see
the
Duke
seat
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
close
to
the
river
-
bank
,
and
she
bravely
go
up
to
him
,
and
thank
him
for
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
"
the
thank
be
due
to
you
for
grace
our
entertainment
,
"
say
the
Duke
,
rise
to
greet
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
dozen
people
stand
round
,
and
so
the
thing
be
do
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
there
come
a
notice
that
their
royal
highness
be
on
the
ground
,
and
the
Duke
,
of
course
,
go
off
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
word
more
speak
between
the
Duke
and
Madame
Goesler
on
that
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
do
not
come
till
late
,
 
till
seven
,
when
the
banquet
be
over
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
right
in
this
,
as
the
banqueting
in
tent
lose
in
comfort
almost
more
than
it
gain
in
romance
.
<EOS>
a
small
picnic
may
be
very
well
,
and
the
distance
previously
travel
may
give
to
a
dinner
on
the
ground
the
seeming
excuse
of
necessity
.
<EOS>
frail
human
nature
must
be
support
,
 
and
human
nature
,
have
go
so
far
in
pursuit
of
the
beautiful
,
be
entitle
to
what
good
support
the
unaccustomed
circumstance
will
allow
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
out
with
the
cold
pie
,
out
with
the
salad
,
and
the
chicken
,
and
the
champagne
.
<EOS>
since
no
well
may
be
,
let
us
recruit
human
nature
sit
upon
this
moss
,
and
forget
our
discomfort
in
the
glory
of
the
verdure
around
us
.
<EOS>
and
dear
Mary
,
see
that
the
cushion
from
the
waggonet
be
small
,
and
not
wish
to
accept
the
too
generous
offer
that
she
should
take
it
all
for
her
own
use
,
will
admit
a
contact
somewhat
closer
than
the
ordinary
chair
of
a
dining
-
room
render
necessary
.
<EOS>
that
in
its
way
be
very
well
;
 
but
I
hold
that
a
banquet
on
narrow
table
in
a
tent
be
displease
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
stroll
into
the
ground
when
the
tent
be
nearly
empty
,
and
when
Lady
Glencora
,
almost
sink
beneath
her
exertion
,
be
take
rest
in
an
inner
room
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
at
this
time
be
dine
with
their
royal
highness
,
and
three
or
four
other
,
specially
select
,
very
comfortably
within
door
.
<EOS>
out
of
door
the
world
have
begin
to
dance
,
 
and
the
world
be
begin
to
say
that
it
would
be
much
nice
to
go
and
dance
upon
the
board
inside
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
for
,
though
of
all
party
a
garden
party
be
the
nice
,
everybody
be
always
anxious
to
get
out
of
the
garden
as
quick
as
may
be
.
<EOS>
a
few
ardent
lover
of
suburban
picturesque
effect
be
sit
beneath
the
haycock
,
and
four
forlorn
damsel
be
vainly
endeavour
to
excite
the
sympathy
of
manly
youth
by
play
croquet
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
,
however
,
that
the
lover
beneath
the
haycock
and
the
player
at
croquet
be
not
actor
hire
by
Lady
Glencora
for
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
have
not
be
long
on
the
lawn
before
he
see
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
She
be
stand
with
another
lady
,
and
Barrington
Erle
be
with
them
.
"
<EOS>
so
you
have
be
successful
?
"
say
Barrington
,
greet
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
successful
in
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
in
what
?
<EOS>
in
get
a
ticket
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
to
promise
three
tide
-
waitership
,
and
to
give
deep
hint
about
a
bishopric
expect
to
be
vacant
,
before
I
get
in
.
<EOS>
but
what
matter
?
<EOS>
success
pay
for
everything
.
<EOS>
My
only
trouble
now
be
how
I
be
to
get
back
to
London
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
shake
hand
with
Phineas
,
and
then
as
he
be
pass
on
,
follow
him
for
a
step
and
whisper
a
word
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
say
,
"
if
you
be
not
go
yet
,
come
back
to
me
presently
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
far
from
the
river
,
and
shall
stay
here
for
about
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
say
that
he
would
,
and
then
go
on
,
not
know
exactly
where
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
He
have
one
desire
,
 
to
find
Violet
Effingham
,
but
when
he
should
find
her
he
could
not
carry
her
off
,
and
sit
with
her
beneath
a
haycock
.
   
<EOS>
the
Horns
 
<EOS>
while
look
for
Violet
Effingham
,
Phineas
encounter
Madame
Goesler
,
among
a
crowd
of
people
who
be
watch
the
adventurous
embarkation
of
certain
daring
spirit
in
a
pleasure
-
boat
.
<EOS>
there
be
waterman
there
in
the
Duke
's
livery
,
ready
to
take
such
spirit
down
to
Richmond
or
up
to
Teddington
lock
,
and
many
daring
spirit
do
take
such
trip
,
 
to
the
great
peril
of
muslin
,
ribbon
,
and
starch
,
to
the
peril
also
of
ornamental
summer
white
garment
,
so
that
when
the
thing
be
over
,
the
boat
be
vote
to
have
be
a
bore
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
to
venture
?
"
say
Phineas
to
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
of
all
thing
if
I
be
not
afraid
for
my
clothe
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
never
good
upon
the
water
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
sea
-
sick
to
a
certainty
.
<EOS>
They
be
go
down
beneath
the
bridge
too
,
and
we
should
be
splash
by
the
steamer
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
my
courage
be
high
enough
.
"
<EOS>
thus
Phineas
excuse
himself
,
be
still
intent
on
prosecute
his
search
for
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
neither
will
I
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
one
dash
from
a
peccant
oar
would
destroy
the
whole
symmetry
of
my
dress
.
<EOS>
look
.
<EOS>
that
green
young
lady
have
already
be
sprinkle
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
the
blue
young
gentleman
have
be
sprinkle
also
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
and
they
will
be
happy
in
a
joint
baptism
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
they
stroll
along
the
river
path
together
,
and
be
soon
alone
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
leave
town
soon
,
Madame
Goesler
?
"
  
"
almost
immediately
.
"
  
"
and
where
do
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
 
to
Vienna
.
<EOS>
I
be
there
for
a
couple
of
month
every
year
,
mind
my
business
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
you
would
know
me
,
if
you
see
me
;
 
sometimes
sit
on
a
stool
in
a
counting
-
house
,
sometimes
go
about
among
old
house
,
settle
what
must
be
do
to
save
them
from
tumble
down
.
<EOS>
I
dress
so
differently
at
such
time
,
and
talk
so
differently
,
and
look
so
much
old
,
that
I
almost
fancy
myself
to
be
another
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
a
great
trouble
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
 
I
rather
like
it
.
<EOS>
It
make
me
feel
that
I
do
something
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
go
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
german
maid
with
me
,
and
never
speak
a
word
to
any
one
else
on
the
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
must
be
very
bad
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
it
be
the
bad
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
then
I
be
so
much
accustomed
to
be
alone
.
<EOS>
You
see
me
in
society
,
and
in
society
only
,
and
therefore
naturally
look
upon
me
as
one
of
a
gregarious
herd
;
but
I
be
in
truth
an
animal
that
feed
alone
and
live
alone
.
<EOS>
take
the
hour
of
the
year
all
through
,
and
I
be
a
solitary
during
four
-
fifth
of
them
.
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
intend
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
go
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
home
to
your
own
people

<EOS>
how
nice
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
people
to
go
to

<EOS>
I
have
one
sister

who
live
with
her
husband
at
Riga
.
<EOS>
She
be
my
only
relation

and
I
never

<EOS>

but
you

thousand
of
friend

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

and
she
turn
and
spread
out
her
hand
towards
the
crowded
lawn
,
which
be
behind
them
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
such
friend
worth

<EOS>
what
would
they
do
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

do
much

Phineas

<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
laugh
also

"
<EOS>
the
Duke

not

bad

she

the

I
will
not

He
may

<EOS>
"
ah
;
 
no

<EOS>
I
have
no
particular
friend

<EOS>
and
be
I
to
wish
to
choose
one

I
should
think
the
Duke
a
little
above
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
 
and
too
stiff
,
and
too
old
,
and
too
pompous

cold

too
make

believe
,

too
gingerbread

"
Mr.

"
  
<EOS>
"
the
Duke
be
all
buckram

you
know

then
why
do
you
come
to
his
house

to

you

be

Mr.
Finn

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
it
be
true
in
its
way

<EOS>
one
go
about
to
meet
those
whom
one
like
,
not
always
for
the
pleasure
of
the
host
's
society
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
be
not
wrong
because
I
go
to
house
at
which
I
like
neither
the
host
nor
the
hostess
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
as
he
say
this
be
think
of
Lady
Baldock
,
to
whom
of
late
he
have
be
exceedingly
civil
,
 
but
he
certainly
do
not
like
Lady
Baldock
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
have
be

Duke
of
Omnium

<EOS>
do
you
know
him
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
personally
?
<EOS>
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
do
you
?
<EOS>
do
anybody
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
be
a
gracious
gentleman
,
"
say
Madame
Goesler
,
"
and
though
I
can
not
boast
of
know
him
well
,
I
do
not
like
to
hear
him
call
buckram
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
he
be
buckram
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
easy
for
a
man
in
his
position
to
live
so
as
to
please
all
people
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
maintain
the
prestige
of
the
high
aristocracy
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
look
at
his
nephew
,
who
will
be
the
next
Duke
,
and
who
work
as
hard
as
any
man
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Will
he
not
maintain
it
better
?
<EOS>
what
good
do
the
present
man
ever
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
believe
only
in
motion
,
Mr.
Finn
;
 
and
not
at
all
in
quiescence
.
<EOS>
an
express
train
at
full
speed
be
grander
to
you
than
a
mountain
with
heap
of
snow
.
<EOS>
I
own
that
to
me
there
be
something
glorious
in
the
dignity
of
a
man
too
high
to
do
anything
,
 
if
only
he
know
how
to
carry
that
dignity
with
a
proper
grace
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
there
should
be
breast
make
to
carry
star
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
star
which
they
have
never
earn
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
 
well
;
we
will
not
fight
about
it
.
<EOS>
go
and
earn
your
star
,
and
I
will
say
that
it
become
you
well
than
any
glitter
on
the
coat
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
"
this
she
say
with
an
earnestness
which
he
could
not
pretend
not
to
notice
or
not
to
understand
.
<EOS>
"
I
too
may
be
able
to
see
that
the
express
train
be
really
great
than
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
though
,
for
your
own
life
,
you
would
prefer
to
sit
and
gaze
upon
the
snowy
peak
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
;
 
that
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
would
prefer
to
be
of
use
somewhere
,
 
to
some
one
,
if
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
I
strive
sometimes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
sure
successfully
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
talk
about
myself

<EOS>
You
and
the
Duke
be
fair
subject
for
conversation
;
you
as
the
express
train
,
who
will
probably
do
your
sixty
mile
an
hour
in
safety
,
but
may
possibly
go
down
a
bank
with
a
crash
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
I
may
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
the
Duke
,
as
the
mountain
,
which
be
fix
in
its
stateliness
,
short
of
the
power
of
some
earthquake
,
which
shall
be
grander
and
more
terrible
than
any
earthquake
yet
know
.
<EOS>
here
we
be
at
the
house
again
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
in
and
sit
down
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

if
I
leave
you

I

I

of

I

it

your

farewell

"
  
<EOS>
then
he
leave
her
.
<EOS>
up
to
this
moment
he
have
not
see
Violet
,
and
yet
he
know
that
she
be
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
She
have
herself
tell
him
that
she
be
to
accompany
Lady
Laura
,
whom
he
have
already
meet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
have
not
be
invite
,
and
have
express
great
animosity
against
the
Duke
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
She
have
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
Duke
be
a
man
at
whose
house
a
young
lady
such
as
her
niece
ought
not
to
be
see

<EOS>
but
Violet
have
laugh
at
this
,
and
declare
her
intention
of
accept
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
"
go
,
"
she
have
say
;
"
of
course
I
shall
go

<EOS>
I
should
have
break
my
heart
if
I
could
not
have
get
there

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
therefore
be
sure
that
she
must
be
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
have
keep
his
eye
ever
on
the
alert
,
and
yet
he
have
not
find
her
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
must
keep
his
appointment
with
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
so
he
go
down
to
the
path
by
the
river
,
and
there
he
find
her
seat
close
by
the
water
's
edge

<EOS>
Her
cousin
Barrington
Erle
be
still
with
her
,

as
soon
as
Phineas
join
them
,
Erle
go
away

<EOS>

I
have
tell
him

Lady
Laura

that
I

you

stay
with

Barrington
a

deal

hope
so

so
much
of
him
as
I
do
when
I
have
less
to
do

<EOS>

He
say
that
you
have
get
into
altogether
a
different
set

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

<EOS>
I
have
go
as
circumstance
have
direct
me

I
have
certainly
not

throw
over
so
old

good
a
friend
as
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
 
he
do
not
blame
you

He
tell
me
that
you

find
your
way
among
what
he
call
the
work
man
of
the
party
,
and
he
think
you
will
do
very
well
,
 
if
you
can
only
be
patient
enough
.
<EOS>
We
all
expect
a
different
line
from
you
,
you
know
,
 
more
of
word
and
less
of
deed
,
if
I
may
say
so
;
 
more
of
liberal
oratory

less
of
government
action
;
but
I
do
not
doubt
that
you
be
right

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
I
have
be
wrong

Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
become
heartily
sick
of
officialitie

<EOS>

that
come
from
the
fickleness
about

papa

fond

Your

may
combine

you

have
you
see
Mr.

lately

<EOS>
She
ask
the
question
abruptly
,
show
that
she
be
anxious
to
get
to
the
matter
respect
which
she
have
summon
him
to
her
side
,
and
that
all
that
she
have
say
hitherto
have
be
utter
as
it
be
in
preparation
of
that
subject

<EOS>
"
see
him
?
<EOS>
yes
;
I
see
him
daily
.
<EOS>
but
we
hardly
do
more
than
speak

"
  
"
why
not
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
stand
for
a
moment
in
silence
,
hesitating
.
<EOS>
"
why
be
it
that
he
and
you
do
not
speak

"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
answer
that
question
,
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
know
any
reason
?
<EOS>
sit
down
,
or
,
if
you
please
,
I
will
get
up
and
walk
with
you

<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
you
have
choose
to
quarrel
with
him
,
and
that
I
have
make
you
do
so

<EOS>
He
say
that
you
have
confess
to
him
that
I
have
ask
you
to
quarrel
with
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
can
hardly
have
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
have
say
it
,
 
in
so
many
word
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
that
I
would
tell
you
such
a
story
falsely

be
he
here
now

no

I
come
alone

"
be
not
Miss
Effingham
with
you

no

she
be
to
come
with
my
father
later

<EOS>
She
be
here
no

,
now

<EOS>
but
answer
my
question
,
Mr.
Finn
;
 
unless
you
find
that
you
can
not
answer
it

what
be
it
that
you
do
say
to
my
husband

"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
to
justify
what

do
you
mean

say
that

have
speak
falsely

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
use
no
harsh
word

I
think
that
Mr.

when
trouble
in
his
spirit
look
at
thing
gloomily
,

put
mean
upon
word
which
they
should
not
bear

what
have
trouble
his

better

He
invite
me
to
his
house

I
would
not
go
,
because
you
have
forbid
me

<EOS>
then
he
ask
me
some
question
about
you

<EOS>
do
I
refuse
because
of
you
,
 
or
of
anything
that
you
have
say
?
<EOS>
if
I
remember
right
,
I
tell
him
that
I
do
fancy
that
you
would
not
be
glad
to
see
me

that
therefore
I
would
rather
stay
away

what
be
I

nothing

be
bad

remember
that

ask
me
the
question
point
-
blank
,

that
no
reply
would
have
be
equal
to
an
affirmation

suggestion

true

I
should

break

no

out

him

story
about

it

express
himself
strongly

he
have
tell
me
since
that

that

again

how
be
it
possible
that
a
woman
should
live
with
such
a
man

why
do
she
come
to
him
with
this
story

him

,
they
be
alone
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
no
alternative
but
to
read
the
letter
,
which
be
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
after
what
you
have
say
to
me
it
be
impossible
that
I
should
return
to
your
house
.
<EOS>
I
shall
meet
my
father
at
the
Duke
of
Omnium
's
,
and
have
already
ask
him
to
give
me
an
asylum
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
wish
to
remain
wherever
he
may
be
,
either
in
town
or
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Should
I
change
my
purpose
in
this
,
and
change
my
residence
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
fail
to
let
you
know
where
I
go
and
what
I
propose
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
I
think
must
have
forget
that
I
be
your
wife
;
but
I
will
never
forget
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
accuse
me
of
have
a
lover
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
have
expect
that
I
should
continue
to
live
with
you
after
such
an
accusation
.
<EOS>
for
myself
I
can
not
understand
how
any
man
can
have
bring
himself
to
bring
such
a
charge
against
his
wife
.
<EOS>
even
have
it
be
true
the
accusation
should
not
have
be
make
by
your
mouth
to
my
ear
.
  
<EOS>
that
it
be
untrue
<EOS>
I
believe
you
must
be
as
well
aware
as
I
be
myself
.
<EOS>
how
intimate
I
be
with
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
and
what
be
the
limit
of
my
intimacy
with
him
you
know
before
I
marry
you
.
<EOS>
after
our
marriage
I
encourage
his
friendship
till
I
find
that
there
be
something
in
it
that
displease
you
,
 
and
,
after
learn
that
,
I
discourage
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
say
that
he
be
my
lover
,
but
you
have
probably
not
define
for
yourself
that
word
very
clearly
.
<EOS>
You
have
feel
yourself
slight
because
his
name
have
be
mention
with
praise
;
 
and
your
jealousy
have
be
wound
because
you
have
think
that
I
have
regard
him
as
in
some
way
superior
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
really
think
that
he
be
my
lover
,
 
that
he
speak
word
to
me
which
other
may
not
hear
,
that
he
claim
from
me
aught
that
a
wife
may
not
give
,
that
he
receive
aught
which
a
friend
should
not
receive
.
<EOS>
the
accusation
have
be
a
coward
's
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
my
father
's
to
-
night
,
and
to
-
morrow
I
will
get
you
to
let
my
servant
bring
to
me
such
thing
as
be
my
own
,
 
my
clothe
,
namely
,
and
desk
,
and
a
few
book
.
<EOS>
She
will
know
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
trust
you
may
be
happy
without
a
wife
,
than
ever
you
have
be
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
feel
almost
daily
since
we
be
married
that
you
be
a
man
who
would
have
be
happy
without
a
wife
than
with
one
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
affectionately
,
  
LAURA
KENNEDY
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
at
any
rate
true
,
"
she
say
,
when
Phineas
have
read
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
true
!
<EOS>
doubtless
it
be
true
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
except
that
I
do
not
suppose
he
be
ever
really
angry
with
me
,
or
jealous
,
or
anything
of
the
sort
,
 
because
I
get
on
well
.
<EOS>
It
seem
absurd
even
to
think
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
too
absurd
for
some
man
.
<EOS>
I
remember
your
tell
me
that
he
be
weak
,
and
poor
,
and
unworthy
.
<EOS>
I
remember
your
saying
so
when
I
first
think
that
he
may
become
my
husband
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
believe
you
when
you
tell
me
so
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
make
such
a
shipwreck
of
myself
as
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
I
have
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
after
what
have
pass
between
us
I
do
not
choose
that
you
should
hear
how
I
be
separate
from
my
husband
from
any
lip
but
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
now
and
find
papa
.
<EOS>
do
not
come
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
be
alone
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
be
leave
stand
by
himself
,
look
down
upon
the
river
as
it
glide
by
.
<EOS>
how
would
it
have
be
with
both
of
them
if
Lady
Laura
have
accept
him
three
year
ago
,
when
she
consent
to
join
her
lot
with
that
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
have
reject
him
?
<EOS>
as
he
stand
he
hear
the
sound
of
music
from
the
house
,
and
remember
that
he
have
come
there
with
the
one
sole
object
of
see
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
He
have
know
that
he
would
meet
Lady
Laura
,
and
it
have
be
in
his
mind
to
break
through
that
law
of
silence
which
she
have
impose
upon
him
,
and
once
more
to
ask
her
to
assist
him
,
 
to
implore
her
for
the
sake
of
their
old
friendship
to
tell
him
whether
there
may
yet
be
for
him
any
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
interview
which
have
just
take
place
it
have
be
impossible
for
him
to
speak
a
word
of
himself
or
of
Violet
.
<EOS>
to
her
,
in
her
great
desolation
,
he
could
address
himself
on
no
other
subject
than
that
of
her
own
misery
.
<EOS>
but
not
the
less
when
she
be
talk
to
him
of
her
own
sorrow
,
of
her
regret
that
she
have
not
listen
to
him
when
in
year
past
he
have
speak
slightingly
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
be
he
think
of
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
have
certainly
mistake
the
sign
of
thing
when
he
have
accuse
his
wife
by
say
that
Phineas
be
her
lover
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
soon
get
over
that
early
feeling
;
and
as
far
as
he
himself
be
concern
have
never
regret
Lady
Laura
's
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
He
remain
down
by
the
water
for
a
few
minute
,
give
Lady
Laura
time
to
escape
,
and
then
he
wander
across
the
ground
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
about
nine
o'clock
,
and
though
there
be
still
many
walk
about
the
ground
,
the
crowd
of
people
be
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
musician
be
range
out
on
a
verandah
,
so
that
their
music
may
have
be
available
for
dance
within
or
without
;
but
the
dancer
have
find
the
board
pleasanter
than
the
lawn
,
and
the
Duke
's
garden
party
be
become
a
mere
ball
,
with
privilege
for
the
dancer
to
stroll
about
the
lawn
between
the
dance
.
<EOS>
and
in
this
respect
the
fun
be
well
than
at
a
ball
,
 
<EOS>
that
let
the
engagement
make
for
partner
be
what
they
may
,
they
could
always
be
break
with
ease
.
<EOS>
no
lady
feel
herself
bind
to
dance
with
a
cavalier
who
be
displease
to
her
;
and
some
gentleman
be
leave
sadly
in
the
lurch
.
<EOS>
Phineas
feel
himself
to
be
very
much
in
the
lurch
,
even
after
he
have
discover
Violet
Effingham
stand
up
to
dance
with
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
He
bide
his
time
patiently
,
and
at
last
he
find
his
opportunity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
she
dance
with
him
?
"
<EOS>
She
declare
that
she
intend
to
dance
no
more
,
and
that
she
have
promise
to
be
ready
to
return
home
with
Lord
Brentford
before
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
pledge
myself
not
to
be
after
ten
,
"
she
say
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
then
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
,
and
they
step
out
upon
the
terrace
together
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
hear
anything
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
ask
him
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
not
dreadful
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
it
be
the
good
thing
she
can
do
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
be
happy
with
him
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
to
be
accuse
after
that
fashion
,
 
by
her
husband
!
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
one
can
hardly
believe
it
in
these
day
.
<EOS>
and
of
all
woman
she
be
the
last
to
deserve
such
accusation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
very
last
,
"
say
Phineas
,
feel
that
the
subject
be
one
upon
which
it
be
not
easy
for
him
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
conceive
to
whom
he
can
have
allude
,
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
then
Phineas
begin
to
understand
that
Violet
have
not
hear
the
whole
story
;
but
the
difficulty
of
speak
be
still
very
great
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
the
result
of
ungovernable
temper
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
a
man
do
not
usually
strive
to
dishonour
himself
because
he
be
in
a
rage
.
<EOS>
and
this
man
be
incapable
of
rage
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
curse
with
one
of
those
dark
gloomy
mind
in
which
love
always
lead
to
jealousy
.
<EOS>
She
will
never
return
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
in
many
respect
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
never
return
to
him
,
"
repeat
Violet
,
 
"
never
.
<EOS>
Would
you
advise
her
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
say
?
<EOS>
if
one
be
call
upon
for
advice
,
one
would
think
so
much
before
one
speak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
,
 
not
for
a
minute
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
to
be
accuse
of
that
!
<EOS>
how
be
a
man
and
woman
to
live
together
after
there
have
be
such
word
between
them
?
<EOS>
poor
Laura
!
<EOS>
what
a
terrible
end
to
all
her
high
hope
!
<EOS>
do
you
not
grieve
for
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
now
at
some
distance
from
the
house
,
and
Phineas
could
not
but
feel
that
chance
have
be
very
good
to
him
in
give
him
his
opportunity
.
<EOS>
She
be
lean
on
his
arm
,
and
they
be
alone
,
and
she
be
speak
to
him
with
all
the
familiarity
of
old
friendship

<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
I
may
change
the
subject
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
ask
you
a
word
about
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
word

<EOS>
she

sharply

simply
this

Miss

you

I
say
that
when
I
hear
it

so

something
of
a

no

I
must
not
call
it
a
hope

something
that
long
to
form
itself
into
hope
return
to
my
breast

and
from
that
hour
to
this
have
be
the
only
subject
on

care
to

He

that
I
love
him

I
do
love
him

I
shall
never

the

confession

that
he
and
I
be
not

there
have
be
thing
which
have
make

that
I
be
perhaps
mistake

in

that
I
would

I
say
so
,
and

myself
to

here

we
will

there
be
Lord

then

quite
alone

Would
it
not
be
well
for
him
to
go
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
and
fle
himself
into
the
quiet
river
,
so
that
there
may
be
an
end
of
him

<EOS>
or
would
it
not

well
still
that
he
should
create
for
himself
some
quiet
river

away
from
London

away
from

away

<EOS>
there
have
frequently
be
in
the
mind
of
this
young

an
idea
that
there
be
something
almost
false
in
his
own
position

that
his
life
be
a
pretence

and
that
he
would
ultimately
be
subject
to
that
ruin
which
always
come

sooner

later
,
on
thing
which
be
false

and
now
as

alone
about
Lady
Glencora

this
feeling
be
very
strong
within
his
bosom

Duke
's
garden
;
and
be
ready
,
in
spite
of
Violet
Effingham
,
to
start
for
Ireland
with
Mr.
Monk
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
in
August
.
<EOS>
the
close
of
that
season
in
London
certainly
be
not
a
happy
period
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
Violet
have
speak
to
him
after
such
a
fashion
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
not
to
believe
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
give
him
no
hint
whether
it
be
likely
or
unlikely
that
she
and
Lord
Chiltern
would
be
reconcile
;
but
she
have
convince
him
that
he
could
not
be
allow
to
take
Lord
Chiltern
's
place
.
<EOS>
"
a
woman
can
not
transfer
her
heart
,
"
she
have
say
.
<EOS>
Phineas
be
well
aware
that
many
woman
do
transfer
their
heart
;
but
he
have
go
to
this
woman
too
soon
after
the
wrench
which
her
love
have
receive
;
he
have
be
too
sudden
with
his
proposal
for
a
transfer
;
and
the
punishment
for
such
ill
judgment
must
be
that
success
would
now
be
impossible
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
yet
how
could
he
have
wait
,
feel
that
Miss
Effingham
,
if
she
be
at
all
like
other
girl
whom
he
have
know
,
may
have
promise
herself
to
some
other
lover
before
she
would
return
within
his
reach
in
the
succeed
spring
?
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
like
some
other
girl
.
<EOS>
ah
;
 
he
know
that
now
,
and
repent
him
of
his
haste
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
ready
for
Mr.
Monk
on
the
7th
of
August
,
and
they
start
together
.
<EOS>
something
less
than
twenty
hour
take
them
from
London
to
Killaloe
,
and
during
four
or
five
of
those
twenty
hour
Mr.
Monk
be
unfitted
for
any
conversation
by
the
uncomfortable
feeling
incidental
to
the
passage
from
Holyhead
to
Kingstown
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
there
be
a
great
deal
of
conversation
between
them
during
the
journey
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
have
almost
make
up
his
mind
to
leave
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
sad
to
me
to
have
to
confess
it
,
"
he
say
,
"
but
the
truth
be
that
my
old
rival
,
Turnbull
,
be
right
.
<EOS>
a
man
who
begin
his
political
life
as
I
begin
mine
,
be
not
the
man
of
whom
a
Minister
should
be
form
.
<EOS>
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
Ministers
of
Government
require
almost
as
much
education
in
their
trade
as
shoemaker
or
tallow
-
chandler
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
you
can
make
a
good
public
servant
of
a
man
simply
because
he
have
get
the
ear
of
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
mean
to
say
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
that
we
be
altogether
wrong
from
begin
to
end
,
in
our
way
of
arrange
these
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
look
at
the
man
who
have
be
lead
statesman
since
our
present
mode
of
government
be
form
,
 
from
the
day
in
which
it
be
form
itself
,
say
from
Walpole
down
,
and
you
will
find
that
all
who
have
be
of
real
use
have
early
training
as
public
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
we
never
to
get
out
of
the
old
groove
?
"
  
"
not
if
the
groove
be
good
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
,
"
those
who
have
be
efficient
as
minister
suck
in
their
efficacy
with
their
mother
's
milk
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brock
do
so
,
and
Lord
de
Terrier
,
and
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
They
seat
themselves
in
office
chair
the
moment
they
leave
college
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
be
in
office
before
he
be
eight
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
be
at
work
as
a
Private
Secretary
when
he
be
three
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
You
,
luckily
for
yourself
,
have
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
regret
it
every
hour
of
my
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
cause
for
regret
,
but
it
be
not
so
with
me
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
man
unfitted
by
his
previous
career
for
office
,
it
be
he
who
have
become
,
or
who
have
endeavour
to
become
,
a
popular
politician
,
 
an
exponent
,
if
I
may
say
so
,
of
public
opinion
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
office
be
offer
to
such
man
with
one
view
only
,
 
that
of
clip
their
wing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
of
obtain
their
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
help
from
Turnbull
would
mean
the
withdrawal
of
all
power
of
opposition
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
give
other
help
for
any
long
term
,
as
the
very
fact
of
his
accept
power
and
patronage
would
take
from
him
his
popular
leadership
.
<EOS>
the
masse
outside
require
to
have
their
minister
as
the
Queen
have
her
;
but
the
same
man
can
not
be
minister
to
both
.
<EOS>
if
the
people
's
minister
choose
to
change
his
master
,
and
to
take
the
Queen
's
shilling
,
something
of
temporary
relief
may
be
gain
by
government
in
the
fact
that
the
other
place
will
for
a
time
be
vacant
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
candidate
enough
for
such
place
,
and
the
vacancy
be
not
a
vacancy
long
.
<EOS>
of
course
the
Crown
have
this
pull
,
that
it
pay
wage
,
and
the
people
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
that
influence
you
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
do
not
influence
me
.
<EOS>
to
you
I
will
make
bold
to
state
so
much
positively
,
though
it
would
be
foolish
,
perhaps
,
to
do
so
to
other
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
go
for
the
shilling
,
though
I
be
so
poor
<EOS>
a
man
that
the
shilling
be
more
to
me
than
it
would
be
to
almost
any
man
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
shilling
,
much
doubt
,
but
guide
in
part
by
this
,
that
I
be
ashamed
of
be
afraid
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
,
 
Mr.
Mildmay
and
the
Duke
,
 
that
I
could
earn
it
to
the
benefit
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
earn
it
,
and
the
country
have
not
be
benefit
,
 
unless
it
be
for
the
good
of
the
country
that
my
voice
in
the
House
should
be
silence
.
<EOS>
if
I
believe
that
,
I
ought
to
hold
my
tongue
without
take
a
salary
for
hold
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
a
mistake
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
such
mistake
make
at
my
time
of
life
can
not
be
wholly
rectify
;
but
,
be
convince
of
my
error
,
I
must
do
the
good
in
my
power
to
put
myself
right
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
bitterness
in
all
this
to
Phineas
himself
of
which
he
could
not
but
make
plaint
to
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
a
man
in
office
must
be
a
slave
,
and
that
slavery
be
distasteful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
I
think
you
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
if
you
mean
that
you
can
not
do
joint
work
with
other
man
altogether
after
your
own
fashion
the
same
may
be
say
of
all
work
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
stick
to
the
Bar
you
must
have
plead
your
cause
in
conformity
with
instruction
from
the
attorney
.

<EOS>

I
should
have
be
guide
by
my
own
light
in
advise
those

I
can
not
see
that
you
suffer
anything
that
ought
to
go
against
the

you

You
be
begin
young

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
day
in
Killaloe
,
that
on
which
Mr.
Monk
arrive
with
Phineas
at
the
doctor
's
house
.
<EOS>
in
London
,
perhaps
,
a
bishop
inspire
more
awe
than
a
Cabinet
Minister
.
<EOS>
in
Killaloe
,
where
a
bishop
may
be
see
walk
about
every
day
,
the
mitred
dignitary
of
the
Church
,
though
much
love
,
be
think
of
,
I
fear
,
but
lightly
;
whereas
a
Cabinet
Minister
come
to
stay
in
the
house
of
a
townsman
be
a
thing
to
be
wonder
at
,
to
be
talk
about
,
to
be
afraid
of
,
to
be
a
fruitful
source
of
conversation
for
a
year
to
come
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
in
Killaloe
,
especially
among
the
eld
lady
,
who
have
shake
their
head
and
express
the
sad
doubt
when
young
Phineas
Finn
have
first
become
a
Parliament
man
.
<EOS>
and
though
by
degree
they
have
be
half
bring
round
,
have
be
drive
to
acknowledge
that
he
have
be
wonderfully
successful
as
a
Parliament
man
,
still
they
have
continue
to
shake
their
head
among
themselves
,
and
to
fear
something
in
the
future
,
 
until
he
appear
at
his
old
home
lead
a
Cabinet
Minister
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
such
assurance
in
this
that
even
old
Mrs.
Callaghan
,
at
the
brewery
,
give
way
,
and
begin
to
say
all
manner
of
good
thing
,
and
to
praise
the
doctor
's
luck
in
that
he
have
a
son
gift
with
part
so
excellent
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
desire
to
see
the
Cabinet
Minister
in
the
flesh
,
to
be
with
him
when
he
eat
and
drank
,
to
watch
the
gait
and
countenance
of
the
man
,
and
to
drink
water
from
this
fountain
of
state
lore
which
have
be
so
wonderfully
bring
among
them
by
their
young
townsman
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
be
aware
that
it
behove
her
to
be
chary
of
her
invitation
,
but
the
lady
from
the
brewery
have
say
such
good
thing
of
Mrs.
Finn
's
black
swan
,
that
she
carry
her
point
,
and
be
invite
to
meet
the
Cabinet
Minister
at
dinner
on
the
day
after
his
arrival

<EOS>
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
and
her
daughter
be
invite
also
to
be
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
when
Phineas
have
be
last
at
Killaloe
,
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
,
as
the
reader
may
remember
,
have
remain
with
her
daughter
at
Floodborough
,
 
feel
it
to
be
her
duty
to
keep
her
daughter
away
from
the
danger
of
an
unrequited
attachment
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
that
her
purpose
be
change
now
,
or
that
she
no
longer
fear
the
danger
,
 
for
both
Mary
and
her
mother
be
now
again
live
in
Killaloe
,
and
Mary
be
at
the
doctor
's
house
as
much
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
before
the
coming
of
the
god
and
the
demigod
to
the
little
town
,
Barbara
Finn
and
her
friend
have
thus
come
to
understand
each
other
as
they
walk
along
the
Shannon
side
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
my
dear
,
that
he
be
engage
to
nobody

Barbara
Finn

"
and
I
be
sure

my
dear
,

say
Mary

"
that
I
do
not
care
whether
he
be

what
do
you
mean

Mary
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
what
I
say

<EOS>
why
should
I
care
?
<EOS>
five
year
ago
I
have
a
foolish
dream
,
and
now
I
be
awake
again
.
<EOS>
think
how
old
I
have
get
to
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
you
be
twenty
-
three
.
<EOS>
what
have
that
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
this
to
do
with
it
;
 
that
I
be
old
enough
to
know
better
.
<EOS>
Mamma
and
I
quite
understand
each
other
.
<EOS>
She
use
to
be
angry
with
him
,
but
she
have
get
over
all
that
foolishness
now
.
<EOS>
It
always
make
me
so
vexed
;
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
be
angry
with
a
man
<EOS>
because
,
 
because
 
!
<EOS>
You
know
one
can
not
talk
about
it
,
it
be
so
foolish
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
not
care
for
him
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
do
you
remember
what
you
use
to
swear
to
me
less
than
two
year
ago
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
all
very
well
,
and
I
remember
what
a
goose
I
be
.
<EOS>
as
for
care
for
him
,
of
course
I
do
,
 
because
he
be
your
brother
,
and
because
I
have
know
him
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
be
go
to
be
marry
to
-
morrow
,
you
would
see
that
it
would
make
no
difference
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Barbara
Finn
walk
on
for
a
couple
of
minute
in
silence
before
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
she
say
at
last
,
"
I
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
;
 
then
all
that
I
shall
ask
of
you
be
,
that
we
may
not
talk
about
him
any
more
.
<EOS>
Mamma
believe
it
,
and
that
be
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
they
do
talk
about
Phineas
during
the
whole
of
that
day
,
and
very
often
talk
about
him
afterwards
,
as
long
as
Mary
remain
at
Killaloe
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
large
dinner
party
at
the
doctor
be
on
the
day
after
Mr.
Monk
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
the
bishop
be
not
there
,
though
he
be
on
term
sufficiently
friendly
with
the
doctor
's
family
to
have
be
invite
on
so
grand
an
occasion
;
but
he
be
not
there
,
because
Mrs.
Finn
be
determine
that
she
would
be
take
out
to
dinner
by
a
Cabinet
Minister
in
the
face
of
all
her
friend
.
<EOS>
She
be
aware
that
have
the
bishop
be
there
,
she
must
have
take
the
bishop
's
arm
.
<EOS>
and
though
there
would
have
be
glory
in
that
,
the
other
glory
be
more
to
her
taste
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
have
ever
see
a
Cabinet
Minister
,
and
I
think
that
she
be
a
little
disappointed
at
find
him
so
like
other
middle
-
aged
gentleman
.
<EOS>
She
have
hope
that
Mr.
Monk
would
have
assume
something
of
the
dignity
of
his
position
;
but
he
assume
nothing
.
<EOS>
now
the
bishop
,
though
he
be
a
very
mild
man
,
do
assume
something
by
the
very
fact
of
his
apron
and
knee
-
breech
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
sir
,
it
be
very
good
of
you
to
come
and
put
up
with
our
humble
way
of
living
,
"
say
Mrs.
Finn
to
her
guest
,
as
they
sit
down
at
table
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
have
resolve
that
she
would
not
make
any
speech
of
the
kind
,
 
that
she
would
condescend
to
no
apology
,
 
that
she
would
bear
herself
as
though
a
Cabinet
Minister
dine
with
her
at
least
once
a
year
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
moment
come
,
she
break
down
,
and
make
this
apology
with
almost
abject
meekness
,
and
then
hate
herself
because
she
have
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
madam
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
,
"
I
live
myself
so
much
like
a
hermit
that
your
house
be
a
palace
of
luxury
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
he
feel
that
he
have
make
a
foolish
speech
,
and
he
also
hate
himself
.
<EOS>
He
find
it
very
difficult
to
talk
to
his
hostess
upon
any
subject
,
until
by
chance
he
mention
his
young
friend
Phineas
.
<EOS>
then
her
tongue
be
unloosed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
son
,
madam
,
"
he
say
,
"
be
go
with
me
to
Limerick
and
back
to
Dublin
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
shame
,
I
know
,
take
him
so
soon
away
from
home
,
but
I
should
not
know
how
to
get
on
without
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Monk
,
it
be
such
a
blessing
for
him
,
and
such
an
honour
for
us
,
that
you
should
be
so
good
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
then
the
mother
speak
out
all
her
past
fear
and
all
her
present
hope
,
and
acknowledge
the
great
glory
which
it
be
to
her
to
have
a
son
sit
in
Parliament
,
hold
an
office
with
a
stately
name
and
a
great
salary
,
and
bless
with
the
friendship
of
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
after
that
Mr.
Monk
get
on
better
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
any
young
man
,
"
say
he
,
"
in
whose
career
I
have
take
so
strong
an
interest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
always
good
,
"
say
Mrs.
Finn
,
with
a
tear
force
itself
into
the
corner
of
each
eye
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
his
mother
,
and
of
course
I
ought
not
to
say
so
,
 
not
in
this
way
;
but
it
be
true
,
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
the
poor
lady
be
oblige
to
raise
her
handkerchief
and
wipe
away
the
drop
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
on
this
occasion
have
take
out
to
dinner
the
mother
of
his
devoted
Mary
,
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
pleasure
it
must
be
to
the
doctor
and
Mrs.
Finn
to
see
you
come
back
in
this
way
,
"
say
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
"
with
all
my
bone
unbroken
?
"
say
he
,
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
with
all
your
bone
unbroken
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
Phineas
,
when
we
first
hear
that
you
be
to
sit
in
Parliament
,
we
be
afraid
that
you
may
break
a
rib
or
two
,
 
since
you
choose
to
talk
about
the
breaking
of
bone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
everybody
think
I
should
come
to
grief
;
but
nobody
feel
so
sure
of
it
as
I
do
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
not
come
to
grief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
out
of
the
wood
yet
,
you
know
,
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
possibility
for
grief
in
my
way
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
far
as
I
can
understand
it
,
you
be
out
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
all
that
your
friend
here
want
to
see
now
be
,
that
you
should
marry
some
nice
english
girl
,
with
a
little
money
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
rumour
have
reach
us
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rumours
always
lie
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
sometimes
they
do
,
of
course
;
and
I
be
not
go
to
ask
any
indiscreet
question
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
what
we
all
hope
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
say
,
only
the
other
day
,
that
if
you
be
once
married
,
we
should
all
feel
quite
safe
about
you
.
<EOS>
and
you
know
we
all
take
the
most
lively
interest
in
your
welfare
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
every
day
that
a
man
from
County
Clare
get
on
as
you
have
do
,
and
therefore
we
be
bind
to
think
of
you
.
"
<EOS>
thus
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
signify
to
Phineas
Finn
that
she
have
forgive
him
the
thoughtlessness
of
his
early
youth
,
 
even
though
there
have
be
something
of
treachery
in
that
thoughtlessness
to
her
own
daughter
;
and
show
him
,
also
,
that
whatever
Mary
's
feeling
may
have
be
once
,
they
be
not
now
of
a
nature
to
trouble
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
you
will
marry
?
"
say
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
very
likely
not
,
"
say
Phineas
,
who
perhaps
look
farther
into
the
mind
of
the
lady
than
the
lady
intend
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
,
"
say
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
every
man
should
marry
as
soon
as
he
can
,
and
especially
a
man
in
your
position
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
the
lady
meet
together
in
the
drawing
-
room
after
dinner
,
it
be
impossible
but
that
they
should
discuss
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
there
be
Mrs.
Callaghan
from
the
brewery
there
,
and
old
Lady
Blood
,
of
Bloodstone
,
 
who
on
ordinary
occasion
would
hardly
admit
that
she
be
on
dining
-
out
term
with
any
one
in
Killaloe
except
the
bishop
,
but
who
have
find
it
impossible
to
decline
to
meet
a
Cabinet
Minister
,
 
and
there
be
Mrs.
Stackpoole
from
Sixmiletown
,
a
far
-
away
cousin
of
the
Finns
,
who
hate
Lady
Blood
with
a
true
provincial
hatred
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
anything
particularly
uncommon
in
him
,
after
all
,
"
say
Lady
Blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
be
very
nice
indeed
,
"
say
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
very
quiet
,
my
dear
,
and
just
like
other
people
,
"
say
Mrs.
Callaghan
,
mean
to
pronounce
a
strong
eulogium
on
the
Cabinet
Minister
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
like
other
people
indeed
,
"
say
Lady
Blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
would
you
expect
,
Lady
Blood
?
"
say
Mrs.
Stackpoole
.
<EOS>
"
man
and
woman
in
London
walk
upon
two
leg
,
just
as
they
do
in
Ennis
.
"
<EOS>
now
Lady
Blood
herself
have
be
bear
and
breed
in
Ennis
,
whereas
Mrs.
Stackpoole
have
come
from
Limerick
,
which
be
a
much
more
considerable
town
,
and
therefore
there
be
a
satire
in
this
allusion
to
the
habit
of
the
man
of
Ennis
which
Lady
Blood
understand
thoroughly
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Stackpoole
,
I
know
how
the
people
walk
in
London
quite
as
well
as
you
do
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Blood
have
once
pass
three
month
in
London
while
Sir
Patrick
have
be
alive
,
whereas
Mrs.
Stackpoole
have
never
do
more
than
visit
the
metropolis
for
a
day
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
doubt
,
"
say
Mrs.
Stackpoole
;
"
but
I
never
can
understand
what
it
be
that
people
expect
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Mr.
Monk
ought
to
have
come
with
his
star
on
the
breast
of
his
coat
,
to
have
please
Lady
Blood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Stackpoole
,
Cabinet
Ministers
do
not
have
star
,
"
say
Lady
Blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
say
they
do
,
"
say
Mrs.
Stackpoole
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
so
nice
and
gentle
to
talk
to
,
"
say
Mrs.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
what
you
will
,
but
man
who
be
high
up
do
very
often
give
themselves
air
.
<EOS>
now
I
must
say
that
this
friend
of
my
son
's
do
not
do
anything
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
the
least
,
"
say
Mrs.
Callaghan
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
quite
the
contrary
,
"
say
Mrs.
Stackpoole
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
be
a
wonderful
man
,
"
say
Lady
Blood
.
<EOS>
"
all
I
say
be
,
that
I
do
not
hear
anything
wonderful
come
out
of
his
mouth
;
and
as
for
people
in
Ennis
walk
on
two
leg
,
I
have
see
donkey
in
Limerick
do
just
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
"
now
it
be
well
know
that
Mrs.
Stackpoole
have
two
son
live
in
Limerick
,
as
to
neither
of
whom
be
it
expect
that
he
would
set
the
Shannon
on
fire
.
<EOS>
after
this
little
speech
there
be
no
further
mention
of
Mr.
Monk
,
as
it
become
necessary
that
all
the
good
-
nature
of
Mrs.
Finn
and
all
the
tact
of
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
and
all
the
energy
of
Mrs.
Callaghan
should
be
use
,
to
prevent
the
raging
of
an
internecine
battle
between
Mrs.
Stackpoole
and
Lady
Blood
.
   
<EOS>
Victrix
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
's
holiday
programme
allow
him
a
week
at
Killaloe
,
and
from
thence
he
be
to
go
to
Limerick
,
and
from
Limerick
to
Dublin
,
in
order
that
,
at
both
place
,
he
may
be
entertain
at
a
public
dinner
and
make
a
speech
about
tenant
-
right
.
<EOS>
foresee
that
Phineas
may
commit
himself
if
he
attend
these
meeting
,
Mr.
Monk
have
counsel
him
to
remain
at
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
but
Phineas
have
refuse
to
subject
himself
to
such
cautious
abstinence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
have
come
to
Ireland
as
his
friend
,
and
he
would
see
him
through
his
travel
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
,
probably
,
be
ask
to
speak
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
and
if
I
be
ask
,
I
need
not
say
more
than
a
few
word
.
<EOS>
and
what
if
I
do
speak
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
find
it
disadvantageous
to
you
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
take
my
chance
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
tie
myself
down
for
ever
and
ever
for
the
sake
of
be
Under
-
Secretary
to
the
Colonies
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
say
very
much
to
him
on
the
subject
,
 
be
constantly
say
very
much
to
him
about
it
;
but
in
spite
of
all
that
Mr.
Monk
say
,
Phineas
do
make
the
journey
to
Limerick
and
Dublin
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
,
since
his
arrival
at
Killaloe
,
be
a
moment
alone
with
Mary
Flood
Jones
till
the
evening
before
he
start
with
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
She
have
keep
out
of
his
way
successfully
,
though
she
have
constantly
be
with
him
in
company
,
and
be
begin
to
plume
herself
on
the
strength
and
valour
of
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
but
her
self
-
praise
have
in
it
nothing
of
joy
,
and
her
glory
be
very
sad
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
would
care
for
him
no
more
,
 
more
especially
as
it
be
so
very
evident
that
he
care
not
at
all
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
the
very
fact
of
her
keep
out
of
his
way
,
make
her
acknowledge
to
herself
that
her
position
be
very
miserable
.
<EOS>
She
have
declare
to
her
mother
that
she
may
certainly
go
to
Killaloe
with
safety
,
 
that
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
put
herself
in
the
way
of
meet
him
as
an
old
friend
,
 
that
the
idea
of
the
necessity
of
shut
herself
up
because
of
his
approach
,
be
the
one
thing
that
give
her
real
pain
.
<EOS>
therefore
her
mother
have
bring
her
to
Killaloe
and
she
have
meet
him
;
but
her
fancied
security
have
desert
her
,
and
she
find
herself
to
be
miserable
,
hope
for
something
she
do
not
know
what
,
still
dream
of
possibility
,
feel
during
every
moment
of
his
presence
with
her
that
some
special
conduct
be
necessary
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
make
further
confession
to
her
mother
and
ask
to
be
carry
back
to
Floodborough
;
but
she
know
that
she
be
very
wretched
at
Killaloe
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Phineas
,
he
have
feel
that
his
old
friend
be
very
cold
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
that
humour
with
reference
to
Violet
Effingham
which
seem
especially
to
require
consolation
.
<EOS>
He
know
now
that
all
hope
be
over
there
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
could
never
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
even
be
she
not
to
marry
Lord
Chiltern
for
the
next
five
year
,
she
would
not
,
during
those
five
year
,
marry
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
such
be
our
hero
's
conviction
;
and
,
suffer
under
this
conviction
,
he
be
in
want
of
the
comfort
of
feminine
sympathy
.
<EOS>
have
Mary
know
all
this
,
and
have
it
suit
her
to
play
such
a
part
<EOS>
,
I
think
she
may
have
have
Phineas
at
her
foot
before
he
have
be
a
week
at
home
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
keep
aloof
from
him
and
have
hear
nothing
of
his
sorrow
.
<EOS>
as
a
natural
consequence
of
this
,
Phineas
be
more
in
love
with
her
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
evening
before
he
start
with
Mr.
Monk
for
Limerick
,
he
manage
to
be
alone
with
her
for
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
Barbara
may
probably
have
assist
in
bring
about
this
arrangement
,
and
have
,
perhaps
,
be
guilty
of
some
treachery
,
 
sister
in
such
circumstance
will
sometimes
be
very
treacherous
to
their
friend
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
,
however
,
that
Mary
herself
be
quite
innocent
of
any
guile
in
the
matter
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
,
"
Phineas
say
to
her
suddenly
,
"
it
seem
to
me
that
you
have
avoid
me
purposely
ever
since
I
have
be
at
home
.
"
<EOS>
She
smile
and
blush
,
and
stammer
and
say
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
have
there
be
any
reason
for
it
,
Mary
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
reason
at
all
that
I
know
of
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
use
to
be
such
great
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
before
you
be
a
great
man
,
Phineas
.
<EOS>
It
must
necessarily
be
different
now
.
<EOS>
You
know
so
many
people
now
,
and
people
of
such
a
different
sort
,
that
of
course
I
fall
a
little
into
the
background
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
talk
in
that
way
,
Mary
,
I
know
that
you
be
laugh
at
me
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
indeed
,
indeed
I
be
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
there
be
no
one
in
the
whole
world
,
"
he
say
,
after
a
pause
,
"
whose
friendship
be
more
to
me
than
yours
be
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
it
so
often
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
say
that
when
we
come
back
it
shall
be
between
us
as
it
use
to
be
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
put
out
his
hand
for
hers
,
and
she
could
not
help
give
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
there
will
be
people
,
"
he
say
,
"
who
talk
nonsense
,
and
one
can
not
help
it
;
but
I
will
not
put
up
with
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
talk
nonsense
,
Phineas
!
"
<EOS>
then
there
come
some
one
across
them
,
and
the
conversation
be
end
;
but
the
sound
of
his
voice
remain
on
her
ear
,
and
she
could
not
help
but
remember
that
he
have
declare
that
her
friendship
be
dearer
to
him
than
the
friendship
of
any
one
else
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
go
with
Mr.
Monk
first
to
Limerick
and
then
to
Dublin
,
and
find
himself
at
both
place
to
be
regard
as
a
hero
only
second
to
the
great
hero
.
<EOS>
at
both
place
the
one
subject
of
debate
be
tenant
-
right
;
 
could
anything
be
do
to
make
it
profitable
for
man
with
capital
to
put
their
capital
into
irish
land
?
<EOS>
the
fertility
of
the
soil
be
question
by
no
one
,
 
nor
the
sufficiency
of
external
circumstance
,
such
as
railroad
and
the
like
;
 
nor
the
abundance
of
labour
;
 
nor
even
security
for
the
wealth
to
be
produce
.
<EOS>
the
only
difficulty
be
in
this
,
that
the
man
who
be
to
produce
the
wealth
have
no
guarantee
that
it
would
be
theirs
when
it
be
create
.
<EOS>
in
England
and
elsewhere
such
guarantee
be
in
existence
.
<EOS>
may
it
not
be
possible
to
introduce
them
into
Ireland
?
<EOS>
that
be
the
question
which
Mr.
Monk
have
in
hand
;
and
in
various
speech
which
he
make
both
before
and
after
the
dinner
give
to
him
,
he
pledge
himself
to
keep
it
well
in
hand
when
Parliament
should
meet
.
<EOS>
of
course
Phineas
speak
also
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
he
should
be
silent
when
his
friend
and
leader
be
pour
out
his
eloquence
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
speak
,
and
of
course
he
pledge
himself
.
<EOS>
something
like
the
old
pleasure
of
the
debate
society
return
to
him
,
as
stand
upon
a
platform
before
a
listening
multitude
,
he
give
full
vent
to
his
word
.
<EOS>
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
of
late
he
have
be
so
cabined
,
crib
,
and
confine
by
office
as
to
have
enjoy
nothing
of
this
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
from
the
commencement
of
his
career
,
he
have
fall
so
thoroughly
into
the
decorum
of
Government
way
,
as
to
have
miss
altogether
the
delight
of
that
wild
irresponsible
oratory
of
which
Mr.
Monk
have
speak
to
him
so
often
.
<EOS>
He
have
envy
man
below
the
gangway
,
who
,
though
support
the
Government
on
main
question
,
could
get
up
on
their
leg
whenever
the
House
be
full
enough
to
make
it
worth
their
while
,
and
say
almost
whatever
they
please
.
<EOS>
there
be
that
Mr.
Robson
,
who
literally
do
say
just
what
come
uppermost
;
and
the
thing
that
come
uppermost
be
often
ill
-
natured
,
often
unbecome
the
gravity
of
the
House
,
be
always
startling
;
but
man
listen
to
him
and
like
him
to
speak
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Robson
have
 
marry
a
woman
with
money
.
<EOS>
oh
,
why
,
 
why
,
have
not
Violet
Effingham
be
kind
to
him
?
<EOS>
He
may
even
yet
,
perhaps
,
marry
a
woman
with
money
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
so
unless
he
love
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
upshot
of
the
Dublin
meeting
be
that
he
also
positively
pledge
himself
to
support
during
the
next
session
of
Parliament
a
bill
advocate
tenant
-
right
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
you
go
so
far
as
that
,
"
Mr.
Monk
say
to
him
almost
as
soon
as
the
meeting
be
over
.
<EOS>
They
be
stand
on
the
pier
at
Kingstown
,
and
Mr.
Monk
be
prepare
to
return
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
not
I
as
far
as
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
have
think
about
it
,
and
I
do
not
think
that
you
have
.
<EOS>
I
be
prepared
to
resign
my
office
to
-
morrow
;
and
directly
that
I
can
see
Mr.
Gresham
and
explain
to
him
what
I
have
do
,
I
shall
offer
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
accept
your
resignation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
accept
it
,
unless
he
be
prepared
to
instruct
the
Irish
Secretary
to
bring
in
such
a
bill
as
I
can
support
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
exactly
in
the
same
boat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
ought
not
to
be
in
the
same
boat
;
 
nor
need
you
.
<EOS>
My
advice
to
you
be
to
say
nothing
about
it
till
you
get
back
to
London
,
and
then
speak
to
Lord
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
tell
him
that
you
will
not
say
anything
on
the
subject
in
the
House
,
but
that
in
the
event
of
there
be
a
division
you
hope
to
be
allow
to
vote
as
on
an
open
question
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
I
shall
get
Gresham
's
assent
,
and
if
so
we
shall
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
,
and
if
they
choose
to
make
it
a
point
with
you
,
you
must
resign
also
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
shall
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
think
they
will
.
<EOS>
You
have
be
too
useful
,
and
they
will
wish
to
avoid
the
weakness
which
come
to
a
ministry
from
change
its
team
.
<EOS>
good
-
bye
,
my
dear
fellow
;
and
remember
this
,
 
my
last
word
of
advice
to
you
be
to
stick
by
the
ship
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
it
be
a
career
which
will
suit
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
begin
it
soon
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
be
rather
melancholy
as
he
return
alone
to
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
to
bid
him
stick
to
the
ship
,
and
he
know
as
well
as
any
one
could
tell
him
how
material
the
ship
be
to
him
;
but
there
be
circumstance
in
which
a
man
can
not
stick
to
his
ship
,
 
can
not
stick
,
at
least
,
to
this
special
Government
ship
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
whither
Mr.
Monk
go
,
in
this
session
,
he
must
follow
.
<EOS>
He
have
considerable
hope
that
when
Mr.
Monk
explain
his
purpose
to
the
Prime
Minister
,
the
Prime
Minister
would
feel
himself
oblige
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
Phineas
would
not
only
be
able
to
keep
his
office
,
but
would
have
such
an
opportunity
of
make
a
speech
in
Parliament
as
circumstance
have
never
yet
give
to
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
again
at
home
he
say
nothing
to
his
father
or
to
the
Killaloeians
as
to
the
danger
of
his
position
.
<EOS>
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
make
his
mother
and
sister
miserable
,
or
to
incur
the
useless
counsel
of
the
doctor
?
<EOS>
They
seem
to
think
his
speech
at
Dublin
very
fine
,
and
be
never
tired
of
talk
of
what
Mr.
Monk
and
Phineas
be
go
to
do
;
but
the
idea
have
not
come
home
to
them
that
if
Mr.
Monk
or
Phineas
choose
to
do
anything
on
their
own
account
,
they
must
give
up
the
place
which
they
hold
under
the
Crown
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
September
when
Phineas
find
himself
back
at
Killaloe
,
and
he
be
due
to
be
at
his
office
in
London
in
November
.
<EOS>
the
excitement
of
Mr.
Monk
's
company
be
now
over
,
and
he
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
receive
pouch
full
of
official
paper
from
the
Colonial
Office
,
and
study
all
the
statistic
which
come
within
his
reach
in
reference
to
the
propose
new
law
for
tenant
-
right
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Mary
be
still
live
with
her
mother
at
Killaloe
,
and
still
keep
herself
somewhat
aloof
from
the
man
she
love
.
<EOS>
how
could
it
be
possible
for
him
not
to
give
way
in
such
circumstance
as
those
?
  
<EOS>
one
day
he
find
himself
talk
to
her
about
himself
,
and
speak
to
her
of
his
own
position
with
more
frankness
than
he
ever
use
with
his
own
family
.
<EOS>
He
have
begin
by
remind
her
of
that
conversation
which
they
have
have
before
he
go
away
with
Mr.
Monk
,
and
by
remind
her
also
that
she
have
promise
to
return
to
her
old
friendly
way
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Phineas
;
there
be
no
promise
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
we
not
to
be
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
say
that
I
make
no
particular
promise
.
<EOS>
of
course
we
be
friend
.
<EOS>
We
have
always
be
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
say
if
you
hear
that
I
have
resign
my
office
and
give
up
my
seat
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
express
her
surprise
,
almost
her
horror
,
at
such
an
idea
,
and
then
he
tell
her
everything
.
<EOS>
It
take
long
in
the
telling
,
because
it
be
necessary
that
he
should
explain
to
her
the
working
of
the
system
which
make
it
impossible
for
him
,
as
a
member
of
the
Government
,
to
entertain
an
opinion
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
mean
that
you
would
lose
your
salary
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
I
should
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
not
that
be
very
dreadful
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
laugh
as
he
acknowledge
that
it
would
be
dreadful
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
dreadful
,
Mary
,
to
have
nothing
to
eat
and
drink
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
a
man
to
do
?
<EOS>
Would
you
recommend
me
to
say
that
black
be
white
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
will
never
do
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Mary
,
it
be
very
nice
to
be
call
by
a
big
name
and
to
have
a
salary
,
and
it
be
very
comfortable
to
be
envy
by
one
's
friend
and
enemy
;
 
but
there
be
drawback
.
<EOS>
there
be
this
especial
drawback
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
pause
for
a
moment
before
he
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
especial
drawback
,
Phineas
?
"
  
"
a
man
can
not
do
what
he
please
with
himself
.
<EOS>
how
can
a
man
marry
,
so
circumstance
as
I
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
hesitate
for
a
moment
,
and
then
she
answer
him
,
 
"
a
man
may
be
very
happy
without
marry
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
also
pause
for
many
moment
before
he
speak
again
,
and
she
then
make
a
faint
attempt
to
escape
from
him
.
<EOS>
but
before
she
succeed
he
have
ask
her
a
question
which
arrest
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
you
would
listen
to
me
if
I
be
to
tell
you
a
history
?
<EOS>
"
of
course
she
listen
,
and
the
history
he
tell
her
be
the
tale
of
his
love
for
Violet
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
she
have
money
of
her
own
?
"
<EOS>
Mary
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
she
be
rich
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
large
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
Mr.
Finn
,
you
must
seek
some
one
else
who
be
equally
bless
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
that
be
untrue
,
 
that
be
ill
-
natured
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
mean
that
.
<EOS>
say
that
you
do
not
mean
it

<EOS>
You
have
not
believe
that
I
love
Miss
Effingham
because
she
be
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
tell
me
that
you
could
love
no
one
who
be
not
rich

<EOS>
"
I
have
say
nothing
of
the
kind

be
involuntary

<EOS>
It
do
not
often
run
in
a
yoke
with
prudence
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
you
my
history
as
far
as
it
be
concerned
with
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
I
do
love
her
very
dearly

"
do
love
her

Mr.

"
yes

there
any
inconstancy

there
inconstancy

in

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

say
Mary
,
to
whom
the
occasion
be
become
so
embarrassing
that
she
no
longer
be
able
to

with
word
that

a
meaning

if
there

I

inconstant

He
pause
,
but
of
course
she
have
not
a
syllable
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
change
my
love

but
I
could
not
speak
of
a
new
passion

I
have
tell
the
story
of
that
which
have
pass
away

<EOS>
You
have
hear
it
all
now
,
Mary

<EOS>
Can
you
try
to
love
me
,
after
that
?
<EOS>
"
It
have
come
at
last
,
 
the
thing
for
which
she
have
be
ever
wish
.
<EOS>
It
have
come
in
spite
of
her
imprudence
,
and
in
spite
of
her
prudence
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
hear
him
to
the
end
she
be
not
a
whit
angry
with
him
,
 
<EOS>
she
be
not

the

aggrieved

because
he
have
be
lose
to
her
in
his
love
for
this
Miss
Effingham

while
she
have
be
so
nearly
lose

her
love

<EOS>
for
woman
such
episode
in
the
life
of
their
lover
have
an
excitement

be
almost
pleasurable

each
man

the
scene

upon

like
the
story

have
think
that
it
have
be
finely
tell
,

be
well
pleased

the
final
catastrophe

she
be
not
prepared

her
reply

have
you
no

Mary
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
,
look
up
into
her
eye
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
that
he
do
not
doubt
what
would
be
her
answer
,
 
as
it
would
be
good
that
all
lover
should
do
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
vouchsafe
me
some
word
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
she
essay
to
speak
she
find
that
she
be
dumb
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
get
her
voice
to
give
her
the
assistance
of
a
single
word
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
cry
,
but
there
be
a
motion
as
of
sob
in
her
throat
which
impede
all
utterance
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
happy
as
earth
,
 
as
heaven
could
make
her
;
but
she
do
not
know
how
to
tell
him
that
she
be
happy
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
long
to
tell
it
,
that
he
may
know
how
thankful
she
be
to
him
for
his
goodness
.
<EOS>
He
still
sit
look
at
her
,
and
now
by
degree
he
have
get
her
hand
in
his
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
,
"
he
say
,
"
will
you
be
my
wife
,
 
my
own
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
when
half
an
hour
have
pass
,
they
be
still
together
,
and
now
she
have
find
the
use
of
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
do
whatever
you
like
good
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
which
you
do
.
<EOS>
if
you
come
to
me
to
-
morrow
and
tell
me
you
have
no
income
,
it
would
make
no
difference

<EOS>
though
to
love
you

to
have
your
love
be
all
the
world
to
me

though
it
make
all
the
difference

I
would
sooner
give
up
that

then
he
take
her
in
his

and
kiss
her

"

<EOS>
Job
's
comforter
 
<EOS>
before
Phineas
have
return
to
London
his
engagement
with
Mary
Flood
Jones
be
know
to
all
his
family
,
be
know
to
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
,
and
be
indeed
know
generally
to
all
Killaloe

<EOS>
that
other
secret

which
have
reference
to
the
probability
of
his
be
oblige
to
throw
up
his
office
,
be
know
only
to
Mary
herself
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
he
have
do
all
that
honour
require
of
him
in
tell
her
of
his
position
before
he
have
propose
;
 
so
that
she
may
on
that
ground
refuse
him
if
she
be
so
minded
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
have
know
very
well
that
such
prudence
on
her
part
be
not
to
be
expect
.
<EOS>
if
she
love
him
,
of
course
she
would
say
so
when
she
be
ask
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
know
that
she
love
him
.
<EOS>
"
there
may
be
delay
,
Mary
,
"
he
say
to
her
as
he
be
go
;
"
nay
,
there
must
be
delay
,
if
I
be
oblige
to
resign
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
a
straw
for
delay
if
you
will
be
true
to
me
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
doubt
my
truth
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
in
the

.
<EOS>
I
will
swear
by
it
as
the
one
thing
that
be
true
in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
,
dearest

<EOS>
and
if
this
should
come
to
pass
I
must
go
to
work
and
put
my
shoulder
to
the
wheel
,
and
earn
an
income
for
you
by
my
old
profession

I
can
make
you
my

with
such
a
motive
before
me
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
shall
earn
an
income

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
thus
they
part
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
though
of
course
she
would
have
prefer
that
her
future
husband
should
remain
in
his
high
office
,
that
he
should
be
a
member
of
Parliament
and
an
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
,
admit
no
doubt
into
her
mind
to
disturb
her
happiness
;
and
Phineas
,
though
he
have
many
misgiving
as
to
the
prudence
of
what
he
have
do
,
be
not
the
less
strong
in
his
resolution
of
constancy
and
endurance
.
<EOS>
He
would
throw
up
his
position
,
resign
his
seat
,
and
go
to
work
at
the
Bar
instantly
,
if
he
find
that
his
independence
as
a
man
require
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
and
,
above
all
,
let
come
what
may
,
he
would
be
true
to
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
December
be
half
over
before
he
see
Lord
Cantrip
.
"
<EOS>
yes
,
 
yes
;
"
say
Lord
Cantrip
,
when
the
Under
-
Secretary
begin
to
tell
his
story
;
"
I
see
what
you
be
about
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
be
at
your
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
know
the
country
as
I
know
it
,
you
would
be
as
eager
about
it
as
I
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
can
only
say
that
I
be
very
glad
that
I
do
not
know
the
country
as
you
know
it
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Finn
,
it
be
my
idea
<EOS>
that
if
a
man
want
to
make
himself
useful
he
should
stick
to
some
special
kind
of
work
.
<EOS>
with
you
it
be
a
thousand
pity
that
you
should
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
,
then
,
I
ought
to
resign
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
anything
about
that
.
<EOS>
as
you
wish
it
,
of
course
I
will
speak
to
Gresham
.
<EOS>
Monk
,
I
believe
,
have
resign
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
write
to
me
,
and
tell
me
so
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
feel
afraid
of
him
for
your
sake
,
Finn
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
be
a
clever
man
,
and
as
honest
a
man
as
any
in
the
House
,
but
I
always
think
that
he
be
a
dangerous
friend
for
you
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
will
see
.
<EOS>
I
will
speak
to
Gresham
after
Christmas
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
hurry
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
Parliament
meet
the
first
great
subject
of
interest
be
the
desertion
of
Mr.
Monk
from
the
Ministry
.
<EOS>
He
at
once
take
his
place
below
the
gangway
,
sit
as
it
happen
exactly
in
front
of
Mr.
Turnbull
,
and
there
he
make
his
explanation
.
<EOS>
some
one
opposite
ask
a
question
whether
a
certain
right
honourable
gentleman
have
not
leave
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Gresham
reply
that
to
his
infinite
regret
his
right
honourable
friend
,
who
lately
preside
at
the
Board
of
Trade
,
have
resign
;
and
he
go
on
to
explain
that
this
resignation
have
,
accord
to
his
idea
,
be
quite
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
His
right
honourable
friend
entertain
certain
idea
about
irish
tenant
-
right
,
as
to
which
he
himself
and
his
right
honourable
friend
the
Secretary
for
Ireland
could
not
exactly
pledge
themselves
to
be
in
unison
with
him
;
but
he
have
think
that
the
motion
may
have
rest
at
any
rate
over
this
session
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Monk
explain
,
make
his
first
great
speech
on
irish
tenant
-
right
.
<EOS>
He
find
himself
oblige
to
advocate
some
immediate
measure
for
give
security
to
the
irish
farmer
;
and
as
he
could
not
do
so
as
a
member
of
the
Cabinet
,
he
be
force
to
resign
the
honour
of
that
position
.
<EOS>
He
say
something
also
as
to
the
great
doubt
which
have
ever
weigh
on
his
own
mind
as
to
the
inexpediency
of
a
man
at
his
time
of
life
submit
himself
for
the
first
time
to
the
trammel
of
office
.
<EOS>
this
call
up
Mr.
Turnbull
,
who
take
the
opportunity
of
say
that
he
now
agree
cordially
with
his
old
friend
for
the
first
time
since
that
old
friend
have
listen
to
the
blandishment
of
the
ministerial
seducer
,
and
that
he
welcome
his
old
friend
back
to
those
independent
bench
with
great
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
the
debate
be
very
exciting
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
say
which
make
it
then
necessary
for
Phineas
to
get
upon
his
leg
or
to
declare
himself
;
but
he
perceive
that
the
time
would
rapidly
come
in
which
he
must
do
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
,
though
he
strove
to
speak
with
gentle
word
,
be
evidently
very
angry
with
the
late
President
of
the
Board
of
Trade
;
and
,
moreover
,
it
be
quite
clear
that
a
bill
would
be
introduce
by
Mr.
Monk
himself
,
which
Mr.
Gresham
be
determine
to
oppose
.
<EOS>
if
all
this
come
to
pass
and
there
should
be
a
close
division
,
Phineas
feel
that
his
fate
would
be
seal
.
<EOS>
when
he
again
speak
to
Lord
Cantrip
on
the
subject
,
the
Secretary
of
State
shrug
his
shoulder
and
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
advise
you
,
"
say
Lord
Cantrip
,
"
to
forget
all
that
take
place
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
do
so
,
nobody
else
will
remember
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
as
if
it
be
possible
to
forget
such
thing
,
"
he
say
in
the
letter
which
he
write
to
Mary
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
shall
go
now
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
not
for
your
sake
,
I
should
not
in
the
least
regret
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
with
Madame
Goesler
frequently
in
the
winter
,
and
have
discuss
with
her
so
often
the
question
of
his
official
position
that
she
have
declare
that
she
be
come
at
last
to
understand
the
mystery
of
an
English
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
quite
right
,
my
friend
,
"
she
say
,
 
"
quite
right
.
<EOS>
what
 
you
be
to
be
in
Parliament
and
say
that
this
black
thing
be
white
,
or
that
this
white
thing
be
black
,
because
you
like
to
take
your
salary
!
<EOS>
that
can
not
be
honest
!
"
<EOS>
then
,
when
he
come
to
talk
to
her
of
money
,
 
that
he
must
give
up
Parliament
itself
,
if
he
give
up
his
place
,
 
she
offer
to
lend
him
money
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
not
treat
me
as
a
friend
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
when
he
point
out
to
her
that
there
would
never
come
a
time
in
which
he
could
pay
such
money
back
,
she
stamp
her
foot
and
tell
him
that
he
have
better
leave
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
high
principle
,
"
she
say
,
"
but
not
principle
sufficiently
high
to
understand
that
this
thing
could
be
do
between
you
and
me
without
disgrace
to
either
of
us
.
"
<EOS>
then
Phineas
assure
her
with
tear
in
his
eye
that
such
an
arrangement
be
impossible
without
disgrace
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
whisper
to
this
new
friend
no
word
of
the
engagement
with
his
dear
Irish
Mary
.
<EOS>
His
irish
life
,
he
would
tell
himself
,
be
a
thing
quite
apart
and
separate
from
his
life
in
England
.
<EOS>
He
say
not
a
word
about
Mary
Flood
Jones
to
any
of
those
with
whom
he
live
in
London
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
,
feel
as
he
do
that
it
would
so
soon
be
necessary
that
he
should
disappear
from
among
them
?
<EOS>
about
Miss
Effingham
he
have
say
much
to
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
She
have
ask
him
whether
he
have
abandon
all
hope
.
<EOS>
"
that
affair
,
then
,
be
over
?
"
she
have
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
it
be
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
she
will
marry
the
red
-
headed
,
violent
lord
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
know
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
will
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
exactly
the
girl
to
remain
unmarried
if
she
take
it
into
her
head
that
the
man
she
like
be
in
any
way
unfitted
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
love
this
lord
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
;
 
there
be
no
doubt
of
that
.
"
<EOS>
and
Phineas
,
as
he
make
this
acknowledgment
,
seem
to
do
so
without
much
inward
agony
of
soul
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
be
last
in
London
he
could
not
speak
of
Violet
and
Lord
Chiltern
together
without
show
that
his
misery
be
almost
too
much
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
time
he
receive
some
counsel
from
two
friend
.
<EOS>
one
be
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
and
the
other
be
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
Laurence
have
always
be
true
to
him
after
a
fashion
,
and
have
never
resent
his
intrusion
at
the
Colonial
Office
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
,
me
boy
,
"
he
say
,
"
if
all
this
be
thrue
,
you
be
about
up
a
tree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
true
that
I
shall
support
Monk
's
motion
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
me
boy
,
you
be
up
a
tree
as
far
as
office
go
.
<EOS>
a
place
like
that
niver
suit
me
,
because
,
you
see
,
that
poker
of
a
young
lord
expect
so
much
of
a
man
;
but
you
do
not
mind
that
kind
of
thing
,
and
I
think
you
be
as
snug
as
snug
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
trouble
will
come
,
you
see
,
Laurence
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Bedad
,
yes
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
throuble
,
I
think
,
sometimes
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
a

the

it

my
belief

she
will
take
you

thry
it
,
Phinny
,
my
boy

that
be
my
advice

<EOS>
"
phinea
so
far
agree
with
his
friend
Laurence
that
he
think
it
possible
that
Madame
Goesler
may
accept
him
be
he
to
propose
marriage
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
of
course
,
that
that
mode
of
escape
from
his
difficulty
be
out
of
the
question
for
him
,
but
he
could
not
explain
this
to
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
hear
that
you
have
take
up
a
bad
cause
,
"
say
Barrington
Erle
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
;
 
be
it
not
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
the
bad
of
it
be
that
you
will
sacrifice
yourself
and
do
no
good
to
the
cause
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
a
man
break
away
in
this
fashion
,
and
not
feel
afterwards
that
he
have
do
it
all
for
nothing

<EOS>

but
what
be
a
man
to
do
,
Barrington
?
<EOS>
He
can
not
smother
his
conviction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
conviction
!
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
on
earth
that
I
be
so
much
afraid
of
in
a
young
member
of
Parliament
as
conviction

<EOS>
there
be
ever
so
many
rock
against
which
man
get
break

<EOS>
one
man
can
not
keep
his
temper

<EOS>
another
can
not
hold
his
tongue

<EOS>
a
third
can
not

a
word
unless
he
have
be
prime
himself
half
a
session

<EOS>
a
fourth
be
always
think
of
himself

want
more
than
he
can
get

a
fifth
be
idle

will
not

<EOS>
a
sixth
be
always
in
the
way

<EOS>
a
seventh
lie
so
that
you
never
can
trust
him

<EOS>
I
have
have
to
do
with
them
all

a
fellow
with
conviction
be
the
bad
of
all

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
how
a

be

himself

Phineas

when
a

begin

meddle

why
can
not
you
grow
into
them
gradually

It
ought
to
be
enough
for
any
man

when
he
begin

to
know

I

look
here
,
Phineas
,
I
do
not
care
two
straw
about
Monk
's
go
.
<EOS>
I
always
think
that
Mildmay
and
the
Duke
be
wrong
when
they
ask
him
to
join
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
go
over
the
trace

unless
,
indeed
,
he
take
his
money

do
nothing
for
it

which
be
the
way
with
some
of

Radicals

along

not
you

such
a
fool
as
to
ruin
yourself
for

It

not

late
yet
for
you

hold
back

<EOS>
to
tell
you
the
truth

Gresham
have
say
a
word
to
me
about
it
already

<EOS>
He
be
most
anxious
that

you

I

<EOS>
Phineas
could
only
thank
his
friend
for
his
advice
,
which
be
at
least
disintereste
,
and
be
good
of
its
kind
,
and
tell
him
that
he
would
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
do
think
of
it
very
much
.
<EOS>
He
almost
think
that
,
be
it
to
do
again
,
he
would
allow
Mr.
Monk
to
go
upon
his
tour
alone
,
and
keep
himself
from
the
utterance
of
anything
that
so
good
a
judge
as
Erle
could
call
stump
balderdash
.
<EOS>
as
he
sit
in
his
arm
-
chair
in
his
room
at
the
Colonial
Office
,
with
despatch
-
box
around
him
,
and
official
paper
spread
before
him
,
 
feel
himself
to
be
one
of
those
who
in
truth
manage
and
govern
the
affair
of
this
great
nation
,
feel
also
that
if
he
relinquish
his
post
now
he
could
never
regain
it
,
 
he
do
wish
that
he
have
be
a
little
less
in
love
with
independence
,
a
little
quieter
in
his
boasting
that
no
official
consideration
should
ever
silence
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
be
too
late
now
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
his
skin
be
not
thick
enough
to
bear
the
arrow
of
those
archer
who
would
bend
their
bow
against
him
if
he
should
now
dare
to
vote
against
Mr.

motion

His

may
be
willing

forgive

there
would

would
read
those
report

would
appear
in

House
with
the
odious
tell

tale
newspaper

he
receive

Dr.

in

be
a
very
excellent
and
well
-
instruct
man

have
be
so
ignorant
of
parliamentary
tactic
,
as
to
have
be
proud
at
his
son
's
success
at
the
irish
meeting
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
that
Phineas
be
carry
on
his
trade
as
a
public
speaker
with
proper
energy
and
continued
success

<EOS>
He
have
care
nothing
himself
for
tenant

right

have
acknowledge
to
Mr.

that
he
could
not
understand
in
what
it
be
that
the
farmer
be
wrong

he
know
that
Mr.

be
a
Cabinet
Minister

he
think
that

earn
his

there
come

undeceive

do

in

must
do

think
about

Mary
also
write
to
him

<EOS>
Mrs.

have
be
talk
to
her
,

Mary
have
teach
herself
to
believe
that
after
the
many
sweet
conversation
she
have
have
with
a
man
so
high
in
office
as
Phineas

she
really
do
understand
something

Mrs.

have
interrogate
Mary

Mary
have
be
oblige
to
own
that

upon
to

why

should
not

all

now

"
<EOS>
then
Mrs.
Finn
begin
to
cry
;
and
Mary
could
only
write
to
her
lover
,
point
out
to
him
how
very
anxious
all
his
friend
be
that

should
do
nothing

what
if

be
do
already

Phineas
in

great
discomfort
go

when

be
there
,
and
only
the

before

when

again
only
the

before

when

<EOS>
phineas
endeavour
to
make
her
understand
that
of
the
four
Prime
Ministers
whom
she
have
name
,
three
be
man
of
the
same
party
as
himself
,
under
whom
it
would
have
suit
him
to
serve
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
serve
under
any
man

I
be
an
english
gentleman
in
Parliament

Madame

<EOS>
"
what
be
a
poor
fellow
to
do

laugh

<EOS>
"
a
poor
fellow
need
not
be
a
poor
fellow

like

say
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
immediately
after
this
Phineas
leave
her
,
and
as
he
go
along
the
street
he
begin
to
question
himself
whether
the
prospect
of
his
own
darling
Mary
be
at
all
endanger
by
his
visit
to
Park
Lane
;
and
to
reflect
what
sort
of
a
blackguard
he
would
be
,
 
a
blackguard
of
how
deep
a
dye
,
 
be
he
to
desert
Mary
and
marry
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
then
he
also
ask
himself
as
to
the
nature
and
quality
of
his
own
political
honesty
if
he
be
to
abandon
Mary
in
order
that
he
may
maintain
his
parliamentary
independence
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
if
it
should
ever
come
to
pass
that
his
biography
should
be
write
,
his
biographer
would
say
very
much
more
about
the
manner
in
which
he
keep
his
seat
in
Parliament
than
of
the
manner
in
which
he
keep
his
engagement
with
Miss
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
half
a
dozen
people
who
know
him
and
her
may
think
ill
of
him
for
his
conduct
to
Mary
,
but
the
world
would
not
condemn
him
!
<EOS>
and
when
he
thunder
forth
his
liberal
eloquence
from
below
the
gangway
as
an
independent
member
,
have
the
fortune
of
his
charming
wife
to
back
him
,
give
excellent
dinner
at
the
same
time
in
Park
Lane
,
would
not
the
world
praise
him
very
loudly
?
  
<EOS>
when
he
get
to
his
office
he
find
a
note
from
Lord
Brentford
invite
him
to
dine
in
Portman
Square
.
   
<EOS>
the
joint
attack
 
<EOS>
the
note
from
Lord
Brentford
surprise
our
hero
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
no
communication
with
the
Earl
since
the
day
on
which
he
have
be
so
savagely
scold
about
the
duel
,
when
the
Earl
have
plainly
tell
him
that
his
conduct
have
be
as
bad
as
it
could
be
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
not
on
that
account
become
at
all
ashamed
of
his
conduct
in
reference
to
the
duel
,
but
he
have
conceive
that
any
reconciliation
between
him
and
the
Earl
have
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
now
there
have
come
a
civilly

word
invitation
,
ask
him
to
dine
with
the
offend
nobleman

<EOS>
the
note
have
be
write
by
Lady
Laura

but
it
have
purport
to
come
from
Lord
Brentford
himself

He
send
back
word
to
say
that
he
should
be
happy

have
the
honour

dining
with

Brentford

this
time

a
month

it
be
already
March

have
hear
nothing

do
not
even
know

he
see
her

do
not
know

Saulsby
.
<EOS>
all
the
world
have
be
talk
of
the
separation
of
Mr.
Kennedy
from
his
wife
,
one
half
of
the
world
declare
that
his
wife
,
if
not
absolutely
false
to
him
,
have
neglect
all
her
duty
;
and
the
other
half
assert
that
Mr.
Kennedy
's
treatment
of
his
wife
have
be
so
bad
that
no
woman
could
possibly
have
live
with
him
.
<EOS>
there
have
even
be
a
rumour
that
Lady
Laura
have
go
off
with
a
lover
from
the
Duke
of
Omnium
's
garden
party
,
and
some
indiscreet
tongue
have
hint
that
a
certain
unmarried
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
be
miss
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
but
Lord
Chiltern
upon
this
have
show
his
tooth
with
so
strong
a
propensity
to
do
some
real
biting
,
that
no
one
have
venture
to
repeat
that
rumour
.
<EOS>
Its
untruth
be
soon
establish
by
the
fact
that
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
be
live
with
her
father
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
Phineas
have
as
yet
see
nothing
since
he
have
be
up
in
town
.
<EOS>
that
gentleman
,
though
a
member
of
the
Cabinet
,
have
not
be
in
London
at
the
opening
of
the
session
,
nor
have
he
attend
the
Cabinet
meeting
during
the
recess
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
state
in
the
newspaper
that
he
be
ill
,
and
state
in
private
that
he
could
not
bear
to
show
himself
since
his
wife
have
leave
him
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
he
come
to
London
,
and
Phineas
see
him
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
then
,
when
the
first
meeting
of
the
Cabinet
be
summon
after
his
return
,
it
become
known
that
he
also
have
resign
his
office
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
say
about
his
resignation
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
He
have
resign
on
the
score
of
ill
-
health
,
and
that
very
worthy
peer
,
Lord
Mount
Thistle
,
formerly
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
,
come
back
to
the
duchy
of
Lancaster
in
his
place
.
<EOS>
a
Prime
Minister
sometimes
find
great
relief
in
the
possession
of
a
serviceable
stick
who
can
be
make
to
go
in
and
out
as
occasion
may
require
;
only
it
generally
happen
that
the
stick
will
expect
some
reward
when
he
be
make
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
Lord
Mount
Thistle
immediately
see
his
way
to
a
viscount
's
coronet
,
when
he
be
once
more
summoned
to
the
august
council
of
the
Ministers
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
this
have
be
arrange
,
in
the
interval
between
Lord
Brentford
's
invitation
and
Lord
Brentford
's
dinner
,
Phineas
encounter
Mr.
Kennedy
so
closely
in
one
of
the
passage
of
the
House
that
it
be
impossible
that
they
should
not
speak
to
each
other
,
unless
they
be
to
avoid
each
other
as
people
do
who
have
palpably
quarrel
.
<EOS>
Phineas
see
that
Mr.
Kennedy
be
hesitate
,
and
therefore
take
the
bull
by
the
horn
.
<EOS>
He
greet
his
former
friend
in
a
friendly
fashion
,
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
and
then
prepare
to
pass
on
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Kennedy
,
though
he
have
hesitate
at
first
,
now
detain
his
brother
member
.
<EOS>
"
Finn
,
"
he
say
,
"
if
you
be
not
engage
I
should
like
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
be
not
engage
,
and
allow
himself
to
be
lead
out
arm
-
in
-
arm
by
the
late
Chancellor
of
the
duchy
into
Westminster
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
know
what
a
terrible
thing
have
happen
to
me
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
have
hear
of
it
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
everybody
have
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
that
be
one
of
the
terrible
cruelty
of
such
a
blow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
those
thing
be
very
bad
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
grieve
,
 
because
you
have
both
be
intimate
friend
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
 
yes
;
we
be
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
see
her
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
since
last
July
,
 
at
the
Duke
's
party
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
;
the
morning
of
that
day
be
the
last
on
which
I
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
she
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
dine
with
Lord
Brentford
to
-
morrow
,
and
I
dare
say
she
will
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
she
be
in
town
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
yesterday
in
her
father
's
carriage
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
she
have
no
cause
to
leave
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
can
not
say
anything
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
have
no
cause
to
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
as
he
hear
this
could
not
but
remember
all
that
Lady
Laura
have
tell
himself
,
and
think
that
no
woman
have
ever
have
a
well
reason
for
leave
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
thing
I
do
not
like
,
and
I
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
be
generally
the
way
,
"
reply
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
surely
a
wife
should
listen
to
a
word
of
caution
from
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
they
never
like
it
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
be
we
all
of
us
to
have
all
that
we
like
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
find
it
so
.
<EOS>
or
would
it
be
good
for
us
if
we
have
?
<EOS>
"
then
he
pause
;
but
as
Phineas
have
no
further
remark
to
make
,
he
continue
speak
after
they
have
walk
about
a
third
of
the
length
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
of
my
own
comfort
I
be
think
now
so
much
as
of
her
name
and
her
future
conduct
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
will
in
every
sense
be
good
for
her
that
she
should
come
back
to
her
husband
's
roof
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
;
yes
;
 
perhaps
it
would
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
she
not
accept
that
lot
for
well
or
for
bad
?
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
,
solemnly
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
incompatibility
of
temper
,
you
know
,
be
always
,
 
always
suppose
 
.
<EOS>
You
understand
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
intention
that
she
should
come
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
to
make
any
legal
demand
;
 
at
any
rate
,
not
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Will
you
consent
to
be
the
bearer
of
a
message
from
me
both
to
herself
and
to
the
Earl
?
"
  
<EOS>
now
it
seem
to
Phineas
that
of
all
the
messenger
whom
Mr.
Kennedy
could
have
choose
<EOS>
he
be
the
most
unsuited
to
be
a
Mercury
in
this
cause
,
 
not
perceive
that
he
have
be
so
select
with
some
craft
,
in
order
that
Lady
Laura
may
understand
that
the
accusation
against
her
be
,
at
any
rate
,
withdraw
,
which
have
name
Phineas
as
her
lover
.
<EOS>
He
pause
again
before
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
should
be
most
willing
to
be
of
service
,
if
it
be
possible

<EOS>
but
I
do
not
see
how
I
can
speak
to
the
Earl
about
it
.
<EOS>
though
I
be
go
to
dine
with
him
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
he
have
ask
me
;
 
for
he
and
I
be
on
very
bad
term
.
<EOS>
He
hear
that
stupid
story
about
the
duel
,
and
have
not
speak
to
me
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
that
,
too
,
"
say
Mr.
Kennedy
,
frown
blackly
as
he
remember
his
wife
's
duplicity
.
  
<EOS>
"
everybody
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
it
have
make
such
a
difference
between
him
and
me
,
that
I
do
not
think
I
can
meddle
.
<EOS>
send
for
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
speak
to
Chiltern
!
<EOS>
never
!
<EOS>
He
would
probably
strike
me
on
the
head
with
his
club
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
call
on
the
Earl
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do

me

I

I
do

answer
me

only
thus
;

indeed
,
indeed
,
it
can
not
be
so

but
it
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
the
law
of
God
require
it
,
and
the
law
of
man
permit
it

<EOS>
I
want
some
one
to
point
out
that
to
them
more
softly
than
I
could
do
if
I
be
simply
to
write
to
that
effect

<EOS>
to
the
Earl

of
course
,
I
can
not
write
again

<EOS>
"
the
conference
end
by
a
promise
from
Phineas
that
he
would
,
if
possible
,
say
a
word
to
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
show
into
Lord
Brentford
's
drawing
-
room
he
find
not
only
Lady
Laura
there
,
but
her
brother

<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
be
not
in
the
room

Barrington
Erle
be
there
,

so
also
be
Lord

Lady
Cantrip

"
be
not
your
father
go
to
be
here
?

say
to
Lady
Laura
,
after
their
first
greeting
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
live
in
that
hope

say
she

do
not

Oswald

<EOS>
"
He
come
in
with
me
half
an
hour
ago

I
suppose
he
do
not
dress
as
quickly
as
I
do
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
;
upon
which
Phineas
immediately
understand
that
the
father
and
the
son
be
reconcile
,
and
he
rush
to
the
conclusion
that
Violet
and
her
lover
would
also
soon
be
reconcile
,
if
such
be
not
already
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
feel
some
remnant
of
a
soreness
that
it
should
be
so
,
as
a
man
feel
where
his
headache
have
be
when
the
real
ache
itself
have
leave
him

then
the
host
come
in
and
make
his
apology

"
<EOS>
Chiltern
keep
me
stand
about
,

he
say
,
"
till
the
east
wind
have
chill
me
through
and
through
.

the
only
charm
I
recognise
in
youth
be
that
it
be
impervious
to
the
east
wind
.
"
<EOS>
Phineas
feel
quite
sure
now
that
Violet
and
her
lover
be
reconcile
,
and
he
have
a
distinct
feeling
of
the
place
where
the
ache
have
be
.
<EOS>
dear
violet
!
<EOS>
but
,
after
all
,
Violet
lack
that
sweet
,
cling
,
feminine
softness
which
make
Mary
Flood
Jones
so
pre
-
eminently
the
most
charming
of
her
sex

<EOS>
the
Earl
,
when
he
have
repeat
his
general
apology
,
especially
to
Lady
Cantrip
,
who
be
the
only
lady
present
except
his
daughter
,
come
up
to
our
hero
and
shake
him
kindly
by
the
hand

<EOS>
He
take
him
up
to
one
of
the
window

then
address
him
in
a
voice
of
mock
solemnity

stick
to

a
good
deal
about
it

I
see
you
,

I
retract
a
part

what
I
say

a
very
foolish

walk
off
with

off
with

down
together

It

"
yes

fashion

long
it
will
last

He

will
not

three

to
go
into
Parliament
,
to
be
an
owner
of
sheep
and
oxen
,
and
to
hunt
in
his
own
county
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
attend
the
first
,
I
should
ruin
myself
with
the
second
,
and
I
should
never
get
a
run
in
the
third
.
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
not
a
word
say
about
his
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
only
seven
who
sit
down
to
dinner
,
and
the
six
be
all
people
with
whom
Phineas
be
or
have
be
on
most
intimate
term

<EOS>
Lord
Cantrip
be
his
official
chief
,
and
,
since
that
connection
have
exist
between
them
,
Lady
Cantrip
have
be
very
gracious
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
quite
understand
the
comfort
which
it
be
to
her
husband
to
have
under
him
,
as
his
representative
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
a
man
whom
he
could
thoroughly
trust
and
like
,
and
therefore
she
have
use
her
woman
's
art
to
bind
Phineas
to
her
lord
in
more
than
mere
official
bondage
.
<EOS>
She
have
try
her
skill
also
upon
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
 
but
altogether
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
have
eat
her
dinner
and
accept
her
courtesy
,
and
have
give
for
them
no
return
whatever
.
<EOS>
but
Phineas
have
possess
a
more
grateful
mind
,
and
have
do
all
that
have
be
require
of
him
;
 
have
do
all
that
have
be
require
of
him
till
there
have
come
that
terrible
absurdity
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
very
well
what
sort
of
thing
would
happen
when
they
bring
such
a
man

Mr.
Monk
into
the
Cabinet

Lady
Cantrip
have
say
to
her

<EOS>
but
though
the
party
be
very
small
,
and
though
the
guest
be
all
his
intimate
friend

Phineas
suspect
nothing
special
till
an
attack
be
make
upon
him
as
soon
as
the
servant
have
leave
the
room

this

no
doubt
,
have
be
preconcerte
.
<EOS>
there
be
Lord
Cantrip
there
,
who
have
already
say
much
to
him
,
and
Barrington
Erle
who
have
say
more
even
than
Lord
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
,
himself
a
member
of
the
Cabinet
,
open
the
attack
by
ask
whether
it
be
actually
true
that
Mr.
Monk
mean
to
go
on
with
his
motion
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
assert
that
Mr.
Monk
positively
would
do
so
.
"
<EOS>
and
Gresham
will
oppose
it
?
"
ask
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
he
will
,
"
say
Barrington
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
will
,
"
say
Lord
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
I
should
think
of
him
if
he
do
not
,
"
say
Lady
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
be
force
into
a
thing
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
then
Phineas
know
pretty
well
what
be
come
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
begin
again
by
ask
how
many
supporter
Mr.
Monk
would
have
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
that
depend
upon
the
amount
of
courage
which
the
Conservatives
may
have
,
"
say
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
if
they
dare
to
vote
for
a
thoroughly
democratic
measure
,
simply
for
the
sake
of
turn
us
out
,
it
be
quite
on
the
card
that
they
may
succeed
.
"
<EOS>
"
but
of
our
own
people
?
"
ask
Lord
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
well
inquire
that
of
Phineas
Finn
,
"
say
Barrington
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
attack
be
make
.
  
<EOS>
Our
hero
have
a
bad
half
hour
of
it
,
though
many
word
be
say
which
must
have
gratify
him
much
.
<EOS>
They
all
want
to
keep
him
,
 
so
Lord
Cantrip
declare
,
"
except
one
or
two
whom
I
could
name
,
and
who
be
particularly
anxious
to
wear
his
shoe
,
"
say
Barrington
,
think
that
certain
reminiscence
of
Phineas
with
regard
to
Mr.
Bonteen
and
other
may
operate
as
strongly
as
any
other
consideration
to
make
him
love
his
place
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
declare
that
he
could
not
understand
it
,
 
that
he
should
find
himself
lose
in
amazement
if
such
a
man
as
his
young
friend
allow
himself
to
be
lead
into
the
outer
wilderness
by
such
an
ignis
-
fatuus
of
light
as
this
.
<EOS>
Lord
Cantrip
lay
down
the
unwritten
traditional
law
of
Government
official
very
plainly
.
<EOS>
a
man
in
office
,
 
in
an
office
which
really
impose
upon
him
as
much
work
as
he
could
possibly
do
with
credit
to
himself
or
his
cause
,
 
be
dispense
from
the
necessity
of
a
conscience
with
reference
to
other
matter
.
<EOS>
It
be
for
Sir
Walter
Morrison
to
have
a
conscience
about
irish
tenant
-
right
,
as
no
doubt
he
have
,
 
just
as
Phineas
Finn
have
a
conscience
about
Canada
,
and
Jamaica
,
and
the
Cape
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
be
very
strong
about
party
in
general
,
and
paint
the
comfort
of
official
position
in
glow
colour
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
that
the
two
lady
be
more
efficacious
than
even
their
male
relative
in
the
argument
which
they
use
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
be
so
happy
to
have
you
among
us
,
"
say
Lady
Cantrip
,
look
at
him
with
beseech
,
almost
love
eye
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
know
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
"
that
since
he
first
come
into
Parliament
I
have
always
believe
in
his
success
,
and
I
have
be
very
proud
to
see
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
shall
weep
over
him
,
as
over
a
fall
angel
,
if
he
leave
us
,
"
say
Lady
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
that
I
will
weep
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
"
but
I
do
not
know
anything
of
the
kind
that
would
so
truly
make
me
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
be
he
to
say
in
answer
to
application
so
flattering
and
so
pressing
?
<EOS>
He
would
have
say
nothing
,
have
that
be
possible
,
but
he
feel
himself
oblige
to
reply
.
<EOS>
He
reply
very
weakly
,
 
of
course
,
not
justify
himself
,
but
declare
that
as
he
have
go
so
far
he
must
go
further
.
<EOS>
He
must
vote
for
the
measure
now
.
<EOS>
both
his
chief
and
Barrington
Erle
prove
,
or
attempt
to
prove
,
that
he
be
wrong
in
this
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
would
not
speak
on
the
measure
,
and
his
vote
for
his
party
would
probably
be
allow
to
pass
without
notice
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
newspaper
may
perhaps
attack
him
;
but
what
public
man
care
for
such
attack
as
those
?
<EOS>
His
whole
party
would
hang
by
him
,
and
in
that
he
would
find
ample
consolation
.
<EOS>
Phineas
could
only
say
that
he
would
think
of
it
;
 
and
this
he
say
in
so
irresolute
a
tone
of
voice
that
all
the
man
then
present
believe
that
he
be
gain
.
<EOS>
the
two
lady
,
however
,
be
of
a
different
opinion
.
"
<EOS>
in
spite
of
anything
that
anybody
may
say
,
he
will
do
what
he
think
right
when
the
time
come
,
"
say
Laura
to
her
father
afterwards
.
<EOS>
but
then
Lady
Laura
have
be
in
love
with
him
,
 
be
perhaps
almost
in
love
with
him
still
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
he
be
a
mule
,
"
say
Lady
Cantrip
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
good
mule
up
a
hill
with
a
load
on
his
back
,
"
say
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
with
a
mule
there
always
come
a
time
when
you
can
not
manage
him
,
"
say
Lady
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Cantrip
have
never
be
in
love
with
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
find
a
moment
,
before
he
leave
Lord
Brentford
's
house
,
to
say
a
word
to
Lady
Laura
as
to
the
commission
that
have
be
give
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
never
be
,
"
say
Lady
Laura
,
shudder
;
 
"
<EOS>
never
,
never
,
never
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
angry
with
me
for
speak
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
 
not
if
he
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
make
me
promise
that
I
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
tell
him
it
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
tell
him
that
if
he
have
any
instruction
to
send
me
as
to
what
he
consider
to
be
my
duty
,
I
will
endeavour
to
comply
,
if
that
duty
can
be
do
apart
.
<EOS>
I
will
recognize
him
so
far
,
because
of
my
vow
.
<EOS>
but
not
even
for
the
sake
of
my
vow
,
will
I
endeavour
to
live
with
him
.
<EOS>
His
presence
would
kill
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
when
Phineas
repeat
this
,
or
as
much
of
this
as
he
judge
to
be
necessary
,
to
Mr.
Kennedy
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
that
gentleman
reply
that
in
such
case
he
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
seek
redress
at
law
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
nothing
to
my
wife
,
"
say
he
,
"
of
which
I
need
be
ashamed
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
sad
,
no
doubt
,
to
have
all
our
affair
bandy
about
in
court
,
and
make
the
subject
of
comment
in
newspaper
,
but
a
man
must
go
through
that
,
or
bad
than
that
,
in
the
vindication
of
his
right
,
and
for
the
performance
of
his
duty
to
his
Maker
.
<EOS>
"
that
very
day
Mr.
Kennedy
go
to
his
lawyer
,
and
desire
that
step
may
be
take
for
the
restitution
to
him
of
his
conjugal
right
.
   
<EOS>
the
Temptress
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
's
bill
be
read
the
first
time
before
Easter
,
and
Phineas
Finn
still
hold
his
office
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
to
the
Prime
Minister
once
on
the
subject
,
and
have
be
surprised
at
that
gentleman
's
courtesy
;
 
for
Mr.
Gresham
have
the
reputation
of
be
unconciliatory
in
his
manner
,
and
very
prone
to
resent
anything
like
desertion
from
that
allegiance
which
be
due
to
himself
as
the
leader
of
his
party
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
stay
where
you
be
and
take
no
step
that
may
be
irretrievable
,
till
you
have
quite
make
up
your
mind
,
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
have
make
up
my
mind
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
can
be
do
till
after
Easter
,
"
reply
the
great
man
,
"
and
there
be
no
know
how
thing
may
go
then
.
<EOS>
I
strongly
recommend
you
to
stay
with
us
.
<EOS>
if
you
can
do
this
it
will
be
only
necessary
that
you
shall
put
your
resignation
in
Lord
Cantrip
's
hand
before
you
speak
or
vote
against
us
.
<EOS>
see
Monk
and
talk
it
over
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
possibly
imagine
that
Mr.
Monk
may
be
move
to
abandon
his
bill
,
when
he
see
what
injury
<EOS>
he
be
about
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
time
Phineas
receive
the
following
letter
from
his
darling
Mary
:
    
Floodborough
,
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
DEAREST
PHINEAS
,
  
<EOS>
We
have
just
get
home
from
Killaloe
,
and
mean
to
remain
here
all
through
the
summer
.
<EOS>
after
leave
your
sister
this
house
seem
so
desolate
;
but
I
shall
have
the
more
time
to
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
read
Tennyson
,
as
you
tell
me
,
and
I
fancy
that
I
could
in
truth
be
a
Mariana
here
,
if
it
be
not
that
I
be
so
quite
certain
that
you
will
come
;
 
and
that
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
in
a
moated
grange
.
<EOS>
last
night
I
sit
at
the
window
and
try
to
realise
what
I
should
feel
if
you
be
to
tell
me
that
you
do
not
want
me
;
and
I
get
myself
into
such
an
ecstatic
state
of
mock
melancholy
that
I
cry
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
but
when
one
have
such
a
real
living
joy
at
the
back
of
one
's
romantic
melancholy
,
tear
be
very
pleasant
;
  
they
water
and
do
not
burn
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
about
them
all
at
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
They
certainly
be
very
unhappy
at
the
idea
of
your
resigning
.
<EOS>
Your
father
say
very
little
,
but
I
make
him
own
that
to
act
as
you
be
act
for
the
sake
of
principle
be
very
grand
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
leave
him
till
he
have
say
so
,
and
he
do
say
it
.
<EOS>
dear
Mrs.
Finn
do
not
understand
it
as
well
,
but
she
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
complain
mostly
for
my
sake
,
and
when
I
tell
her
that
I
will
wait
twenty
year
if
it
be
necessary
,
she
tell
me
I
do
not
know
what
waiting
mean
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
,
 
and
will
be
happy
,
and
will
never
really
think
myself
a
Mariana
.
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
,
<EOS>
dear
Phineas
,
indeed
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
the
girl
be
half
sad
and
half
proud
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
wholly
proud
,
and
know
that
you
be
do
just
what
you
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
shall
think
more
of
you
as
a
man
who
may
have
be
a
Prime
Minister
than
if
you
be
really
sit
in
the
Cabinet
like
Lord
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
as
for
mamma
,
I
can
not
make
her
quite
understand
it
.
<EOS>
She
merely
say
that
no
young
man
who
be
go
to
be
marry
ought
to
resign
anything
.
<EOS>
dear
mamma
;
 
sometimes
she
do
say
such
odd
thing
.
  
<EOS>
You
tell
me
to
tell
you
everything
,
and
so
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
talk
to
some
of
the
people
here
,
and
tell
them
what
they
may
do
if
they
have
tenant
-
right
.
<EOS>
one
old
fellow
,
Mike
Dufferty
,
 
I
do
not
know
whether
you
remember
him
,
 
<EOS>
ask
if
he
would
have
to
pay
the
rent
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
when
I
say
certainly
he
would
,
then
he
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
but
as
you
say
once
,
when
we
want
to
do
good
to
people
one
have
no
right
to
expect
that
they
should
understand
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
baptize
little
infant
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
both
your
note
;
 
<EOS>
seven
word
in
one
,
Mr.
Under
-
Secretary
,
and
nine
in
the
other
!
<EOS>
but
the
one
little
word
at
the
end
be
worth
a
whole
sheet
full
of
common
word
.
<EOS>
how
nice
it
be
to
write
letter
without
pay
postage
,
and
to
send
them
about
the
world
with
a
grand
name
in
the
corner
.
<EOS>
when
Barney
bring
me
one
he
always
look
as
if
he
do
not
know
whether
it
be
a
love
letter
or
an
order
to
go
to
Botany
Bay
.
<EOS>
if
he
see
the
inside
of
them
,
how
short
they
be
,
I
do
not
think
he
would
think
much
of
you
as
a
lover
nor
yet
as
an
Under
-
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
think
ever
so
much
of
you
as
both
;
 
I
do
,
indeed
;
and
I
be
not
scold
you
a
bit
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
I
can
have
two
or
three
dear
,
sweet
,
love
word
,
I
shall
be
as
happy
as
a
queen
.
<EOS>
ah
,
if
you
know
it
all
!
<EOS>
but
you
never
can
know
it
all
.
<EOS>
a
man
have
so
many
other
thing
to
learn
that
he
can
not
understand
it
.
  
<EOS>
good
-
bye
,
dear
,
dear
,
dear
man
.
<EOS>
whatever
you
do
I
shall
be
quite
sure
you
have
do
the
good
.
  
<EOS>
ever
your
own
,
with
all
the
love
of
her
heart
,
  
<EOS>
MARY
F.
JONES
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
nice
.
<EOS>
such
a
man
as
be
Phineas
Finn
always
take
a
delight
which
he
can
not
express
even
to
himself
in
the
receipt
of
such
a
letter
as
this
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
so
flattering
as
the
warm
expression
of
the
confidence
of
a
woman
's
love
,
and
Phineas
think
that
no
woman
ever
express
this
more
completely
than
do
his
Mary
.
<EOS>
Dear
,
dearest
Mary
.
<EOS>
as
for
give
her
up
,
as
for
treachery
to
one
so
trust
,
so
sweet
,
so
well
beloved
,
that
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
but
nevertheless
the
truth
come
home
to
him
more
clearly
day
by
day
,
that
he
of
all
man
be
the
last
who
ought
to
have
give
himself
up
to
such
a
passion
.
<EOS>
for
her
sake

for

he
ought

have

from

aloof
from
Mr.

<EOS>
that
very
day
,
with

letter
in
his
pocket

he
go
to
the
livery
stable
and
explain
that
he
would
not
keep
his
horse
any
longer

<EOS>
there
be
no
difficulty
about
the
horse

<EOS>
Mr.
Howard
Macleod
of
the
Treasury
would
take
him
from
that
very
hour
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
walk
away
,
utter
a
curse
upon
Mr.

Macleod

<EOS>
Mr.
Howard
Macleod
be
just
begin
the
glory
of
his
life
in
London
,

he
,
Phineas
Finn

to
an
end

<EOS>
with
Mary

letter
in

he
go
up
to
Portman
Square

<EOS>
He
have
again
get
into
the
habit
of
see
Lady
Laura
frequently
,
and
be
often
with
her
brother
,
who
now
again
live
at
his
father

<EOS>
a
letter
have
reach
Lord
Brentford
,
through
his
lawyer
,
in
which
a
demand
be
make
by
Mr.
Kennedy
for
the
return
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
determine
that
she
would
never
go
back
to
him
;
and
there
have
come
to
her
a
doubt
whether
it
would
not
be
expedient
that
she
should
live
abroad
so
as
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
persecution
from
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
be
in
great
wrath
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
have
once
or
twice
hint
that
perhaps
he
have
well
"
see
"
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
the
amenity
of
such
an
interview
,
as
this
would
be
,
have
up
to
the
present
day
be
postpone
;
and
,
in
a
certain
way
,
Phineas
have
be
use
as
a
messenger
between
Mr.
Kennedy
and
his
wife
's
family

<EOS>
"
I

it

in
my
go

what

dulness
amount
to
when
one
have
come

such
a

this

<EOS>
when
one
be
in
the
ruck
of
fortune

to
be
dull
be
very
bad
;

when
misfortune
come
,
simple
dulness
be
nothing

It
sound
almost
like
relief

It

away

him

also

it
not
hard

he
too
should
be
drive
away

be
odd
enough
that
we
should
both

go
at
the

you
will
not
go

I

I

I
have
resolve
upon

that
if
I

up
my

I
will
give
up
my

<EOS>
I
go
into
Parliament
with
the
hope

office

how
can
I
remain
there
when
I
shall
have
gain
it
and
then
have
lose
it
?

<EOS>
"

you
will
stay
in
London
,
Mr.

I
think
not

<EOS>
after
all
that
have
come

go
I
should
not

happy
here
,

I
should
make
my
way
easy
and
on
cheap
term
in
Dublin
.
<EOS>
My
present
idea
be
that
I
shall
endeavour
to
make
a
practice
over
in
my
own
country

It
will
be
hard
work
begin
at
the
bottom

it
not

so
unnecessary

on

,
with

have
estrange

I
be
sure

this

that
if

she

It
certainly
be
not

he
hardly

be
wretched

at

still

do
not

feel

move
him

make
him
acknowledge
to
himself

how
great
would
be
the
pity
of
such
a
failure
as
would
be
his

He
be
quite
as
much
alive
as

could
be
to
the
fact
that
work
at

either
in
London

in
Dublin

would
have
no
charm

such
a

very
dreary

have
a
position

too

House

you

comfort
myself
in

it

so

all
that

go

yours

disturb

you
can
advise
me

offer
marriage
to
a
woman

a
woman

I
be
to
seek
merely
because
she
be
rich

yes

I
do
so
advise
you

You
have
have
your

must
now
put
up
with
reality

why
should
I
so
advise
you

for
the

Your

will
do
me
no

<EOS>
I
shall

I
shall
hear

it

banish
out
of
England
hear
a
distant
misunderstood
report

what
be
go
on

I
still

regard
enough

bold

know

it
amiss

first
take
you
in
hand
between
us
,
Barrington
and
I
,
I
have
never
swerve
in
my
anxiety
on
your
behalf
.
<EOS>
when
I
resolve
that
it
would
be
well
for
us
both
that
we
should
be
only
friend
,
I
do
not
swerve
.
<EOS>
when
you
would
talk
to
me
so
cruelly
of
your
love
for
Violet
,
I
do
not
swerve
.
<EOS>
when
I
warn
you
from
Loughlinter
because
I
think
there
be
danger
,
I
do
not
swerve
.
<EOS>
when
I
bade
you
not
to
come
to
me
in
London
because
of
my
husband
,
I
do
not
swerve
.
<EOS>
when
my
father
be
hard
upon
you
,
I
do
not
swerve
then
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
leave
him
till
he
be
soften
.
<EOS>
when
you
try
to
rob
Oswald
of
his
love
,
and
I
think
you
would
succeed
,
 
<EOS>
for
I
do
think
so
,
 
I
do
not
swerve
.
<EOS>
I
have
ever
be
true
to
you
.
<EOS>
and
now
that
I
must
hide
myself
and
go
away
,
and
be
see
no
more
,
I
be
true
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
,
 
dearest
Laura
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
speak
with
no
touch
of
anger
,
but
all
in
sorrow
;
 
<EOS>
"
it
must
not
be
like
that
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
room
for
that
.
<EOS>
nor
do
you
mean
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
so
ill
of
you
.
<EOS>
but
there
may
not
be
even
word
of
affection
between
us
 
<EOS>
only
such
as
I
may
speak
to
make
you
know
that
I
be
your
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
my
friend
,
"
he
say
,
stretch
out
his
hand
to
her
as
he
turn
away
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
my
friend
,
indeed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
do
as
I
would
have
you
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
and
have
the
letter
between
his
finger
with
the
purport
of
show
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
moment
the
thought
occur
to
him
that
be
he
to
do
so
,
then
,
indeed
,
he
would
be
bind
for
ever
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
bind
for
ever
,
 
bind
for
ever
to
his
own
Mary
;
but
he
desire
to
have
the
privilege
of
think
over
such
bondage
once
more
before
he
proclaim
it
even
to
his
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
her
that
she
tempt
him
,
and
she
stand
before
him
now
as
a
temptress
.
<EOS>
but
lest
it
may
be
possible
that
she
should
not
tempt
in
vain
,
 
that
letter
in
his
pocket
must
never
be
show
to
her
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
Lady
Laura
must
never
hear
from
his
lip
the
name
of
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
He
leave
her
without
any
assured
purpose
;
 
without
,
that
is
,
the
assurance
to
her
of
any
fix
purpose
.
<EOS>
there
yet
want
a
week
to
the
day
on
which
Mr.
Monk
's
bill
be
to
be
read
,
 
or
not
to
be
read
,
 
the
second
time
;
and
he
have
still
that
interval
before
he
nee
decide
.
<EOS>
He
go
to
his
club
,
and
before
he
dine
he
strove
to
write
a
line
to
Mary
;
 
but
when
he
have
the
paper
before
him
he
find
that
it
be
impossible
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
though
he
do
not
even
suspect
himself
of
an
intention
to
be
false
,
the
idea
that
be
in
his
mind
make
the
effort
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
paper
away
from
him
and
go
down
and
eat
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
Saturday
,
and
there
be
no
House
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
He
have
remain
in
Portman
Square
with
Lady
Laura
till
near
seven
o'clock
,
and
be
engage
to
go
out
in
the
evening
to
a
gathering
at
Mrs.
Gresham
's
house
.
<EOS>
everybody
in
London
would
be
there
,
and
Phineas
be
resolve
that
as
long
as
he
remain
in
London
he
would
be
see
at
place
where
everybody
be
see
.
<EOS>
He
would
certainly
be
at
Mrs.
Gresham
's
gathering
;
but
there
be
an
hour
or
two
before
he
nee
go
home
to
dress
,
and
as
he
have
nothing
to
do
,
he
go
down
to
the
smoking
-
room
of
his
club
.
<EOS>
the
seat
be
crowd
,
but
there
be
one
vacant
;
and
before
he
have
look
about
him
to
scrutinise
his
neighbourhood
,
he
find
that
he
have
place
himself
with
Bonteen
on
his
right
hand
and
Ratler
on
his
left
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
two
man
in
all
London
whom
he
more
thoroughly
dislike
;
but
it
be
too
late
for
him
to
avoid
them
now
.
  
<EOS>
They
instantly
attack
him
,
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
so
I
be
tell
you
be
go
to
leave
us
,
"
say
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
can
have
be
ill
-
natured
enough
to
whisper
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
"
reply
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
whisper
be
very
loud
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
say
Ratler
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
know
already
pretty
nearly
how
every
man
in
the
House
will
vote
,
and
I
have
not
get
your
name
down
on
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
change
it
for
heaven
's
sake
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
if
you
will
tell
me
seriously
that
I
may
,
"
say
Ratler
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
opinion
be
,
"
say
Bonteen
,
"
that
a
man
should
be
know
either
as
a
friend
or
foe
.
<EOS>
I
respect
a
declare
foe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
know
me
as
a
declared
foe
then
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
and
respect
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
,
"
say
Ratler
,
"
but
it
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
have
a
sort
of
fear
about
you
,
Finn
,
that
you
would
go
over
the
trace
some
day
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
a
very
grand
thing
to
be
independent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
fine
thing
in
the
world
,
"
say
Bonteen
;
"
only
so
d
 
d
useless
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
a
man
should
not
be
independent
and
stick
to
the
ship
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
You
forget
the
trouble
you
cause
,
and
how
you
upset
all
calculation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
think
of
the
calculation
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
Finn
,
"
say
Bonteen
,
"
you
be
make
of
clay
too
fine
for
office
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
find
it
have
be
so
with
man
from
your
country
.
<EOS>
You
be
the
grand
horse
in
the
world
to
look
at
out
on
a
prairie
,
but
you
do
not
like
the
slavery
of
harness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
the
sound
of
a
whip
over
our
shoulder
set
us
kick
;
 
do
it
not
,
Ratler
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
show
the
list
to
Gresham
to
-
morrow
,
"
say
Ratler
,
"
and
of
course
he
can
do
as
he
please
;
but
I
do
not
understand
this
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
you
be
in
a
hurry
,
"
say
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
bet
you
a
sovereign
Finn
vote
with
us
yet
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
like
be
a
little
coy
to
set
off
a
girl
's
charm
.
<EOS>
I
will
bet
you
a
sovereign
,
Ratler
,
that
Finn
go
out
into
the
lobby
with
you
and
me
against
Monk
's
bill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
not
be
able
to
stand
any
more
of
this
most
unpleasant
raillery
,
get
up
and
go
away
.
<EOS>
the
club
be
distasteful
to
him
,
and
he
walk
off
and
saunter
for
a
while
about
the
park
.
<EOS>
He
go
down
by
the
Duke
of
York
's
column
as
though
he
be
go
to
his
office
,
which
of
course
be
close
at
this
hour
,
but
turn
round
when
he
get
beyond
the
new
public
building
,
 
building
which
he
be
never
destine
to
use
in
their
complete
state
,
 
and
enter
the
gate
of
the
enclosure
,
and
wander
on
over
the
bridge
across
the
water
.
<EOS>
as
he
go
his
mind
be
full
of
thought
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
good
for
him
to
give
up
everything
for
a
fair
face
?
<EOS>
He
swear
to
himself
that
of
all
woman
whom
he
have
ever
see
Mary
be
the
sweetest
and
the
dear
and
the
good
.
<EOS>
if
it
could
be
well
to
lose
the
world
for
a
woman
,
it
would
be
well
to
lose
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
Violet
,
with
all
her
skill
,
and
all
her
strength
,
and
all
her
grace
,
could
never
have
write
such
a
letter
as
that
which
he
still
hold
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
the
good
charm
of
a
woman
be
that
she
should
be
soft
,
and
trusting
,
and
generous
;
and
who
ever
have
be
more
soft
,
more
trusting
,
and
more
generous
than
his
Mary
?
<EOS>
of
course
he
would
be
true
to
her
,
though
he
do
lose
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
yield
such
a
triumph
to
the
Ratlers
and
Bonteens
whom
he
leave
behind
him
,
 
to
let
them
have
their
will
over
him
,
 
to
know
that
they
would
rejoice
scurrilously
behind
his
back
over
his
downfall
!
<EOS>
the
feeling
be
terrible
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
last
word
which
Bonteen
have
speak
make
it
impossible
to
him
now
not
to
support
his
old
friend
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
what
Bonteen
have
say
,
but
that
the
word
of
Mr.
Bonteen
so
plainly
indicate
what
would
be
the
word
of
all
the
other
Bonteens
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
weak
in
this
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
have
he
be
strong
,
he
would
have
allow
himself
to
be
guide
,
 
if
not
by
the
firm
decision
of
his
own
spirit
,
 
by
the
counsel
of
such
man
as
Mr.
Gresham
and
Lord
Cantrip
,
and
not
by
the
sarcasm
of
the
Bonteens
and
Ratlers
of
official
life
.
<EOS>
but
man
who
sojourn
amidst
savagery
fear
the
mosquito
more
than
they
do
the
lion
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
think
that
he
should
yield
his
blood
to
such
a
one
as
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
and
he
must
yield
his
blood
,
unless
he
could
vote
for
Mr.
Monk
's
motion
,
and
hold
his
ground
afterwards
among
them
all
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
He
would
at
any
rate
see
the
session
out
,
and
try
a
fall
with
Mr.
Bonteen
when
they
should
be
sit
on
different
bench
,
 
if
ever
fortune
should
give
him
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
meantime
,
what
should
he
do
about
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
what
a
fate
be
his
to
have
the
handsome
woman
in
London
with
thousand
and
thousand
a
year
at
his
disposal
!
<EOS>
for
,
 
so
he
now
swear
to
himself
,
 
Madame
Goesler
be
the
handsome
woman
in
London
,
as
Mary
Flood
Jones
be
the
sweetest
girl
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
arrive
at
any
decision
so
fix
as
to
make
him
comfortable
when
he
go
home
and
dress
for
Mrs.
Gresham
's
party
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
know
,
 
he
think
that
he
know
that
he
would
be
true
to
Mary
Flood
Jones

His

It

Phineas

have
receive

We

Phineas

<EOS>
after
that
he
push
his

still
higher
up

have
no

purpose
in

not
dream
of
any
such
success

that
of
reach

a
point

him

through

descend
the

<EOS>
the
thing
,
he
think
,
be
to
be
do
with
courage

patience
,
and
this
may
,
probably
,
be
the
last
time
in
his

that
he
would
find
himself
in

house
of
a
Prime

<EOS>
just
at
the
turn

at

he
find
Mr.

Mr.

talk
with

very

with

get
upward

like

not

quickly

with

It
do
not

Mr.

have
you

yes

I

"
ah
,
you
have
such
faith
in
a
combination
of
british
colony

properly
back
in
Downing

as
to
think
them
strong
against

in

I
should
hold

you

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
 
yes
,
 
I
be
not
down
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
but
I
confess
to
a
feeling
that
the
world
would
go
on
even
though
we
have
nothing
to
say
to
a
single
province
in
North
America
.
<EOS>

that
be
for
your
private
ear

You
be
not

in

then
there
come
up
somebody
else
,
and
Phineas
go
on
upon
his
slow
course

<EOS>
He
have
long
for
an
opportunity
to
tell
Mr.
Gresham
that
he
could
go
to
Downing
Street
no
more
,
but
such
opportunity
have
not
reach
him
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
long
time
he
find
himself
stick
close
by
the
side
of
Miss
Fitzgibbon
,
 
Miss
Aspasia
Fitzgibbon
,
 
who
have
once
relieve
him
from
terrible
pecuniary
anxiety
by
pay
for
him
a
sum
of
money
which
be
due
by
him
on
her
brother
's
account
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
very
nice
thing
to
be
here
,
but
one
do
get
tired
of
it
,
"
say
Miss
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
tired
,
"
say
Phineas

<EOS>
"
of
course
it
be
a
part
of
your
duty
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
You
be
on
your
promotion

be
bind
to
be
here

<EOS>
when
I
ask
Laurence
to
come
,
he
say
there
be
nothing
to

the
card
be

They

the

some

He
could
not
explain
to
Miss
Fitzgibbon
that
it
would
never
again
be
his
fate
to
hold
a
single
trump
in
his
hand
;
so
he
make
another
fight
,
and
get
on
a
few
step
farther
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
a
word
as
he
go
to
half
a
dozen
friend
,
 
as
friend
go
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
detain
for
five
minute
by
Lady
Baldock
,
who
be
very
gracious
and
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
She
tell
him
that

She
be
somewhere
with

really

Lady

have
hear

really
,
I
do

I
be
tell

"
Mr.

be
not

anything

one
can
not

and
when
I
hear
that
a
woman
be
separate
from
her
husband

I
always
think
that
she
must
have
be
imprudent
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
uncharitable

I
think
it
be
most
safe
so
to
consider

as

as
I
have

It
may
be
so

<EOS>
gentleman
will
always
take
the
lady
's
part
,
 
of
course

I
should
be
very
sorry
to
have
a
daughter
separate
from
her
husband

very
sorry

"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
have
nothing
now
to
gain
from
Lady
Baldock
's
favour
,
leave
her
abruptly
,
and
go
on
again
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
desire
to
see
Lady
Laura
and
Violet
together
,
though
he
could
hardly
tell
himself
why
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
see
Miss
Effingham
since
his
return
from
Ireland
,
and
he
think
that
if
he
meet
her
alone
he
could
hardly
have
talk
to
her
with
comfort
;
but
he
know
that
if
he
meet
her
with
Lady
Laura
,
she
would
greet
him
as
a
friend
,
and
speak
to
him
as
though
there
be
no
cause
for
embarrassment
between
them
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
so
far
disappointed
,
that
he
suddenly
encounter
Violet
alone
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
lean
on
the
arm
of
Lord
Baldock
,
and
Phineas
see
her
cousin
leave
her

but
he
would
not
be
such
a
coward
as
to
avoid
her
,
especially
as
he
know
that
she
have
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

Mr.

there

Phineas
turn
his

with
his

bolt
upright
against

with
his

as
black
as

pray
take
me
to
her

nothing

away

much
about

take
Violet

hand
upon

and
very
slowly
make
his

across

there
they
find

alone

start
off
to

call

celerity

could
use

<EOS>
as
he
go
,
make
his

much
quicker
through
the
crowd
than
he
have
do
when
he
have
no
such
object
for
haste

he
purposely
avoid
the
door
by
which
Mr.
Kennedy
have
stand

<EOS>
It
would
have
be
his
near
way
,
but
his
present
service
,
he
think
,
require
that
he
should
keep
aloof
from
the
man

<EOS>
but
Mr.

pass
through

any
law

You
tell

then
Mr.

fight
his
way
down
the

Phineas

follow
in

<EOS>
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
Phineas
return
to
the
two

tiding
that
the

would
be

as
soon

could
be

and
then
,
in
the
presence

Phineas
give
the
message
.
<EOS>
He
think
it
better
that
it
should
be
give

and
be
he
to
decline
to
deliver
it
now

it
would
never

whether
there

I
will
never
live

though
all
the
judge
of
the
land
should
decide
that
I
must
do
so

<EOS>
Phineas
think
much
of
all
this
as
he
go
to
his
solitary
lodging
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
be
not
the
world
much
better
with
him
than
it
be
with
either
of
those
two
wretched
married
being

<EOS>
and
why
?
<EOS>
He
have
not
,
at
any
rate
as
yet
,
sacrifice
for
money
or
social
gain
any
of
the
instinct
of
his
nature

<EOS>
He
have
be
fickle
,
foolish
,
vain
,
uncertain
,
and
perhaps
covetous
;
 
but
as
yet
he
have
not
be
false

<EOS>
then
he
take
out
Mary

last
letter
and
read
it
again

Notes
 
<EOS>
It
would
,
perhaps
,
be
difficult

between

which
have
be
most
wrong

which
have

the

from

promise

would
use
her
influence
with
her
lover

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
I
think
it
right
that
he
should
do
something
,
"
Violet
have
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
he
will
if
you
bid
him

reply
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
Violet
express
a
great
doubt
as
to
this
willingness
of
obedience
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
promise
to
do
her
good
,
and
she
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
when
she
speak
to
him
,
knit
his
brow
with
an
apparent
ferocity
of
anger
which
his
countenance
frequently
express
without
any
intention
of
ferocity
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
He
be
annoy
,
but
be
not
savagely
disposed
to
Violet
.
<EOS>
as
he
look
at
her
,
however
,
he
seem
to
be
very
savagely
disposed
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
you
would
have
me
do
?
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
you
choose
some
occupation
,
Oswald
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
occupation
?
<EOS>
what
be
it
that
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Ought
I
to
be
a
shoemaker
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
that
by
preference
,
I
should
say
;
but
that
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
when
her
lover
have
frown
at
her
,
Violet
have
resolve
,
 
have
strongly
determine
,
with
inward
assertion
of
her
own
right
,
 
that
she
would
not
be
frighten
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
talk
nonsense

<EOS>
You

<EOS>

You
may
go
into

You

do
anything

<EOS>
You
ought
to
do
something

You
know

<EOS>
You
know
that
your

be
right

what
he
say

<EOS>
"
  
"
that
be
easily
assert
,
Violet
;
but
it
would
,
I
think
,
be
well
that
you
should
take
my
part
than
my
father
's
,
if
it
be
that
you
intend
to

my

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
I
intend

would
you
wish
that
I
should
respect
my
husband

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
will
you
not
do
so
if
you
marry
me

<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
then
Violet
look
into
his
face
and
see
that
the
frown
be
blacker
than
ever
.
<EOS>
the
great
mark
down
his
forehead
be
deep
and
more
like
an
ugly
wound
than
she
have
ever
see
it
;
and
his
eye
sparkle
with
anger
;
and
his
face
be
red
as
with
fiery
wrath
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
with
him
when
she
be
no
more
than
engage
to
him
,
how
would
it
be
when
they
should
be
man
and
wife
?
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
she
would
not
fear
him

not
now
at

.
"
<EOS>
no
,
Oswald
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
resolve
upon

an
idle
man

I
shall
not

<EOS>
It
be
well
that
I
should
tell
you
the

"
  
<EOS>
"
a
great

better

he

Will
be

he
demand
with

<EOS>
"
Oswald

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you

"
  
<EOS>
then
she
again
resolve
that

<EOS>
"
It
will
be
discreditable

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
Violet
,
after
what
you
have
say

we
have
well
part

<EOS>
"
She
be
still
proud
,
still
determined
,
and
they
do
part
.
<EOS>
though
it
nearly
break
her
heart
to
see
him
leave
her
,
she
bid
him
go
.
<EOS>
She
hate
herself
afterwards
for
her
severity
to
him
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
would
not
submit
to
recall
the
word
which
she
have
speak
.
<EOS>
She
have
think
him
to
be
wrong
,
and
,
so
think
,
have
conceive
it
to
be
her
duty
and
her
privilege
to
tell
him
what
she
think
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
no
wish
to
lose
him
;
 
no
wish
not
to
be
his
wife
<EOS>
even
,
though
he
should
be
as
idle
as
the
wind
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
constituted
that
she
have
never
allow
him
or
any
other
man
to
be
master
of
her
heart
,
 
till
she
have
with
a
full
purpose
<EOS>
give
her
heart
away
.
<EOS>
the
day
before
she
have
resolve
to
give
it
to
one
man
,
she
may
,
I
think
,
have
resolve
to
give
it
to
another
.
<EOS>
love
have
not
conquer
her
,
but
have
be
take
into
her
service
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
she
could
not
now
rid
herself
of
her
servant
,
when
she
find
that
his
service
would
stand
her
no
longer
in
good
stead
.
<EOS>
She
part
from
Lord
Chiltern
with
an
assent
,
with
an
assure
brow
,
and
with
much
dignity
in
her
gait
;
but
as
soon
as
she
be
alone
she
be
a
prey
to
remorse
.
<EOS>
She
have
declare
to
the
man
who
be
to
have
be
her
husband
that
his
life
be
discreditable
,
 
and
,
of
course
,
no
man
would
bear
such
language
.
<EOS>
have
Lord
Chiltern
borne
it
,
he
would
not
have
be
worthy
of
her
love
.
  
<EOS>
She
herself
tell
Lady
Laura
and
Lord
Brentford
what
have
occur
,
 
and
have
tell
Lady
Baldock
also
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
have
,
of
course
,
triumph
,
 
and
Violet
seek
her
revenge
by
swear
that
she
would
regret
for
ever
the
loss
of
so
inestimable
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
then
why
have
you
give
him
up
,
my
dear
?
"
demand
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
because
I
find
that
he
be
too
good
for
me
,
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubtful
whether
Lady
Baldock
be
not
justified
,
when
she
declare
that
her
niece
be
to
her
a
care
so
harass
that
no
aunt
know
in
history
have
ever
be
so
troubled
before
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
have
fuss
and
fume
,
and
have
certainly
make
thing
bad
.
<EOS>
He
have
quarrel
with
his
son
,
and
then
make
it
up
,
and
then
quarrel
again
,
 
swear
that
the
fault
must
all
be
attribute
to
Chiltern
's
stubbornness
and
Chiltern
's
temper
.
<EOS>
latterly
,
however
,
by
Lady
Laura
's
intervention
,
Lord
Brentford
and
his
son
have
again
be
reconcile
,
and
the
Earl
endeavour
manfully
to
keep
his
tongue
from
disagreeable
word
,
and
his
face
from
evil
look
,
when
his
son
be
present
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
make
it
up
,
"
Lady
Laura
have
say
,
"
if
you
and
I
do
not
attempt
to
make
it
up
for
them
.
<EOS>
if
we
do
,
they
will
never
come
together
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Earl
be
convince
,
and
do
his
good
.
<EOS>
but
the
task
be
very
difficult
to
him
.
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
keep
his
tongue
off
his
son
while
his
son
be
daily
say
thing
of
which
any
father
,
 
any
such
father
as
Lord
Brentford
,
 
could
not
but
disapprove
?
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
profess
to
disbelieve
even
in
the
wisdom
of
the
House
of
Lords
,
and
on
one
occasion
assert
that
it
must
be
a
great
comfort
to
any
Prime
Minister
to
have
three
or
four
old
woman
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
the
father
,
when
he
hear
this
,
try
to
rebuke
his
son
tenderly
,
strove
even
to
be
jocose
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
one
wish
of
his
heart
that
Violet
Effingham
should
be
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
but
even
with
this
wish
he
find
it
very
hard
to
keep
his
tongue
off
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
when
Lady
Laura
discuss
the
matter
with
Violet
,
Violet
would
always
declare
that
there
be
no
hope
.
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
"
she
say
on
the
morning
of
that
day
on
which
they
both
go
to
Mrs.
Gresham
's
,
"
that
though
we
like
each
other

love
each
other

if
you
choose

so

not

why
not
fit

<EOS>
"
We
be

alike

headstrong

masterful

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
as
the
woman
,
ought
to
give
way

say
Lady
Laura

<EOS>
"
but
we
do
not
always
do
just
what
we
ought

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
difficult
it

me

a

myself

<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
say
that

rather
do
say
it

bring
ourselves
to
what
you
call
a
pass

to
such
a
pass

be
able

live
together

discuss
it
for
the
rest

take
it

I

I
could
be
knit
together
by
some
adhesion
of
fraternal
affection
that
should
be
void
of
offence
to
my
husband
;
and
in
furtherance
of
this
he
be
ask
to
Loughlinter
when
I
go
there
,
just
after
I
have
accept
Robert
.
<EOS>
He
come
down
,
and
I
measure
him
too
,
as
you
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
measure
him
,
and
I
find
that
he
want
nothing
to
come
up
to
the
height
require
by
my
standard
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
know
him
better
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
possibly
;
 
but
why
measure
him
at
all
,
when
such
measurement
be
useless
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
one
help
such
thing
?
<EOS>
He
come
to
me
one
day
as
I
be
sit
up
by
the
Linter
.
<EOS>
You
remember
the
place
,
where
it
make
its
first
leap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
do
I.
Robert
have
show
it
me
as
the
fair
spot
in
all
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
there
this
lover
of
our
sing
his
song
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
he
tell
me
then
;
but
I
know
that
I
tell
him
that
I
be
engage
;
and
I
feel
when
I
tell
him
so
that
my
engagement
be
a
sorrow
to
me
.
<EOS>
and
it
have
be
a
sorrow
from
that
day
to
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
the
hero
,
Phineas
,
 
<EOS>
he
be
still
dear
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
hate
me
,
have
he
become
my
husband
?
<EOS>
and
you
will
hate
Madame
Goesler
when
she
become
his
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
dog
in
the
manger
.
<EOS>
I
have
even
go
so
far
as
almost
to
wish
,
at
certain
moment
,
that
you
should
accept
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
he
have
wish
it
so
heartily
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
one
can
hardly
forgive
a
man
for
such
speedy
change
,
"
say
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
not
to
forgive
him
;
 
I
,
who
have
turn
myself
away
from
him
with
a
fix
purpose
the
moment
that
I
find
that
he
have
make
a
mark
upon
my
heart
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
wipe
off
the
mark
,
and
yet
I
marry
.
<EOS>
be
he
not
to
try
to
wipe
off
his
mark
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
that
he
wipe
it
off
very
quickly
;
 
and
since
that
he
have
wipe
off
another
mark
.
<EOS>
one
do
not
know
how
many
mark
he
have
wipe
off
.
<EOS>
They
be
like
the
inn
-
keeper
's
score
which
he
make
in
chalk
.
<EOS>
a
damp
cloth
bring
them
all
away
,

leave
nothing
behind

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
have
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
should
be
a
little
notch
on
the
stick

to
remember
by

Violet

<EOS>
not
that
I
complain

I

I

myself

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
silly
,
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
in
not
have
allow
myself
to
be
notch
by
this
great
champion
?
"
  
"
a
man
like
Mr.
Finn
have
his
life
to
deal
with
,
 
to
make
the
most
of
it
,
and
to
divide
it
between
work
,
pleasure
,
duty
,
ambition
,
and
the
rest
of
it
as
best
he
may
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
any
softness
of
heart
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
him
that
love
should
bear
a
part
in
all
these
interest

<EOS>
but
a
man
will
be
a
fool
who
will
allow
love
to
be
the
master
of
them
all

<EOS>
He
will
be
one
whose
mind
be
so
ill
-
balance
as
to
allow
him
to
be
the
victim
of
a
single
wish

<EOS>
even
in

passion
such
as
that

evidence

Laura

that
you
be
weak

if
I
be
,
do
that
condemn
him

<EOS>
He
be
a
man
,
if
I
judge
him
rightly
,
who
will
be
constant
as
the
sun
,
when
constancy
can

so

he
have
just
gratify

never

"
  
<EOS>
"
violet
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
seem

even
that

not

thing
finally

do
it
?
"
<EOS>
then
some
one
come
upon
them
,
and
the
conversation
be
bring
to
an
end
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
's
generosity
 
<EOS>
when
Phineas
Finn
leave
Mr.
Gresham
's
house
he
have
quite
resolve
what
he
would
do
.
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
he
would
tell
Lord
Cantrip
that
his
resignation
be
a
necessity
,
and
that
he
would
take
that
nobleman
's
advice
as
to
resign
at
once
,
or
wait
till
the
day
on
which
Mr.
Monk
's
irish
Bill
would
be
read
for
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Finn
,
I
can
only
say
that
I
deeply
regret
it
,
"
say
Lord
Cantrip
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
do
I.
I
regret
to
leave
office
,
which
I
like
,
 
and
which
indeed
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
regret
specially
to
leave
this
office
,
as
it
have
be
a
thorough
pleasure
to
me
;
and
I
regret
,
above
all
,
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
convinced
that
Monk
be
right
,
and
I
find
it
impossible
not
to
support
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
that
Mr.
Monk
be
at
Bath
,
"
say
Lord
Cantrip
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
could
only
smile
,
and
shrug
his
shoulder
,
and
say
that
even
though
Mr.
Monk
be
at
Bath
it
would
not
probably
make
much
difference
.
<EOS>
when
he
tender
his
letter
of
resignation
,
Lord
Cantrip
beg
him
to
withdraw
it
for
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
He
would
,
he
say
,
speak
to
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
the
debate
on
the
second
reading
of
Mr.
Monk
's
bill
would
not
take
place
till
that
day
week
,
and
the
resignation
would
be
in
time
if
it
be
tender
before
Phineas
either
speak
or
vote
against
the
Government
.
<EOS>
so
Phineas
go
back
to
his
room
,
and
endeavour
to
make
himself
useful
in
some
work
appertain
to
his
favourite
Colonies
.
  
<EOS>
that
conversation
have
take
place
on
a
Friday
,
and
on
the
follow
Sunday
,
early
in
the
day
,
he
leave
his
room
after
a
late
breakfast
,
 
a
prolong
breakfast
,
during
which
he
have
be
study
tenant
-
right
statistic
,
prepare
his
own
speech
,
and
endeavour
to
look
forward
into
the
future
which
that
speech
be
to
do
so
much
to
influence
,
 
and
turn
his
face
towards
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
certain
understanding
between
him
and
Madame
Goesler
that
he
be
to
call
in
Park
Lane
on
this
Sunday
morning
,
and
then
declare
to
her
what
be
his
final
resolve
as
to
the
office
which
he
hold
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
simply
to
bid
her
adieu
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
for
I
shall
hardly
see
her
again
.
"
<EOS>
and
yet
,
as
he
take
off
his
morning
easy
coat
,
and
dress
himself
for
the
street
,
and
stand
for
a
moment
before
his
looking
-
glass
,
and
see
that
his
glove
be
fresh
and
that
his
boot
be
properly
polish
,
I
think
there
be
a
care
about
his
person
which
he
would
have
hardly
take
<EOS>
have
he
be
quite
assure
that
he
simply
intend
to
say
good
-
bye
to
the
lady
whom
he
be
about
to
visit
.
<EOS>
but
if
there
be
any
such
conscious
feeling
,
he
administer
to
himself
an
antidote
before
he
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
on
return
to
the
sit
-
room
he
go
to
a
little
desk
from
which
he
take
out
the
letter
from
Mary
which
the
reader
have
see
,
and
carefully
peruse
every
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
be
the
good
of
them
all
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
as
he
refolde
the
letter
and
put
it
back
into
his
desk
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
that
it
be
well
that
a
man
should
have
any
large
number
from
whom
to
select
a
good
;
as
,
in
such
circumstance
,
he
be
so
very
apt
to
change
his
judgment
from
hour
to
hour
.
<EOS>
the
quality
which
be
the
most
attractive
before
dinner
sometimes
become
the
least
so
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
the
morning
be
warm
,
and
he
take
a
cab
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
do
that
he
should
speak
even
his
last
farewell
to
such
a
one
as
Madame
Goesler
with
all
the
heat
and
dust
of
a
long
walk
upon
him
.
<EOS>
have
be
so
careful
about
his
boot
and
glove
he
may
as
well
use
his
care
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
be
a
very
pretty
woman
,
who
spare
herself
no
trouble
in
make
herself
as
pretty
as
Nature
would
allow
,
on
behalf
of
those
whom
she
favour
with
her
smile
;
and
to
such
a
lady
some
special
attention
be
due
by
one
who
have
receive
so
many
of
her
smile
as
have
Phineas
.
<EOS>
and
he
feel
,
too
,
that
there
be
something
special
in
this
very
visit
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
make
by
appointment
,
and
there
have
come
to
be
an
understanding
between
them
that
Phineas
should
tell
her
on
this
occasion
what
be
his
resolution
with
reference
to
his
future
life
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
he
have
be
very
wise
in
fortify
himself
with
a
further
glance
at
our
dear
Mary
's
letter
,
before
he
trust
himself
within
Madame
Goesler
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
yes
;
 
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
open
by
Madame
Goesler
's
own
maid
,
who
,
smile
,
explain
that
the
other
servant
be
all
at
church
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
become
sufficiently
intimate
at
the
cottage
in
Park
Lane
to
be
on
friendly
term
with
Madame
Goesler
's
own
maid
,
and
now
make
some
little
half
-
familiar
remark
as
to
the
propriety
of
his
visit
during
church
time
.
<EOS>
"
Madame
will
not
refuse
to
see
you
,
I
be
think
,
"
say
the
girl
,
who
be
a
German
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
be
alone
?
"
ask
Phineas
.
"
<EOS>
alone
?
<EOS>
yes
;
 
of
course
she
be
alone
.
<EOS>
who
should
be
with
her
now
?
"
<EOS>
then
she
take
him
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
;
but
,
when
there
,
he
find
that
Madame
Goesler
be
absent
.
<EOS>
"
She
shall
be
down
directly
,
"
say
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
tell
her
who
be
here
,
and
she
will
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
pretty
room
.
<EOS>
It
may
almost
be
say
that
there
could
be
no
pretty
room
in
all
London
.
<EOS>
It
look
out
across
certain
small
private
garden
,
 
which
be
as
bright
and
gay
as
money
could
make
them
when
bring
into
competition
with
London
smoke
,
 
right
on
to
the
park
.
<EOS>
outside
and
inside
the
window
,
flower
and
green
thing
be
so
arrange
that
the
room
itself
almost
look
as
though
it
be
a
bower
in
a
garden
.
<EOS>
and
everything
in
that
bower
be
rich
and
rare
;
and
there
be
nothing
there
which
annoy
by
its
rarity
or
be
distasteful
by
its
richness
.
<EOS>
the
seat
,
though
they
be
costly
as
money
could
buy
,
be
mean
for
sit
,
and
be
comfortable
as
seat
.
<EOS>
there
be
book
for
reading
,
and
the
mean
of
read
them
.
<EOS>
two
or
three
gem
of
english
art
be
hang
upon
the
wall
,
and
could
be
see
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
mirror
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
precious
toy
lie
here
and
there
about
the
room
,
 
toy
very
precious
,
but
place
there
not
because
of
their
price
,
but
because
of
their
beauty
.
<EOS>
Phineas
already
know
enough
of
the
art
of
live
to
be
aware
that
the
woman
who
have
make
that
room
what
it
be
,
have
charm
to
add
a
beauty
to
everything
she
touch
.
<EOS>
what
would
such
a
life
as
his
want
,
if
grace
by
such
a
companion
,
 
such
a
life
as
his
may
be
,
if
the
mean
which
be
her
be
at
his
command
?
<EOS>
It
would
want
one
thing
,
he
think
,
 
the
self
-
respect
which
he
would
lose
if
he
be
false
to
the
girl
who
be
trust
him
with
such
sweet
trust
at
home
in
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
very
few
minute
Madame
Goesler
be
with
him
,
and
,
though
he
do
not
think
about
it
,
he
perceive
that
she
be
bright
in
her
apparel
,
that
her
hair
be
as
soft
as
care
could
make
it
,
and
that
every
charm
belong
to
her
have
be
bring
into
use
for
his
gratification
.
<EOS>
He
almost
tell
himself
that
he
be
there
in
order
that
he
may
ask
to
have
all
those
charm
bestow
upon
himself
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
who
have
lately
come
to
Park
Lane
and
be
a
suppliant
for
the
possession
of
those
rich
endowment
;
but
I
wonder
whether
they
would
have
be
more
precious
in
his
eye
<EOS>
have
he
know
that
they
have
so
move
the
heart
of
the
great
Duke
as
to
have
induce
him
to
lay
his
coronet
at
the
lady
's
foot
.
<EOS>
I
think
that

no

so
sweetly

morning

you

yes

a
little
so

I

I
receive
visitor
,

bad
still
,
a
visitor
,
 
at
this
hour
on
this
day

<EOS>
but
then
it
be
so
pleasant
to
feel
oneself
to
be
naughty
!
<EOS>
there
be
a
bohemian
flavour
of
picnic
about
it
which
,
though
it
do
not
come
up
to
the
rich
gusto
of
real
wickedness
,
make
one
fancy
that
one
be
on
the
border
of
that
delightful
region
in
which
there
be
none
of
the
constraint
of
custom
,
 
where
man
and
woman
say
what
they
like
,
and
do
what
they
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
pleasant
enough
to
be
on
the
border
,
"
say
Phineas

<EOS>
"
that
be
just
it

<EOS>
of

propriety

We

well

I

Madame

<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing

Mr.

if
you
do

I
be
sure
you
agree
with
me
that
you
often
envy
the
improper
people

the
Bohemians

the
people

do
not
trouble
themselves
about

any

unpleasant

now
I
should
not

if
I

myself

back
a
year

two

just
because
I
have
allow
you

come

when

I

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
settle

before

indeed

as
I
look
back
at

all
now

I
can
hardly
tell
when
it
be
not

<EOS>
It
be
impossible

have
be
impossible

that
I
should
do
otherwise

<EOS>
I
still
hold
my
place
,
Madame

I
have
declare
that
I
shall
give
it
up
before

debate
come
on

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
fix

"
quite
fix

my

what
next
?

<EOS>
Madame

,
as
she
thus

lean
across

him
from

with
both

<EOS>
We
all
know
that
look
of
true
interest
which
the
countenance
of
a
real
friend
will
bear
when
the
welfare
of
his
friend
be
in
question
.
<EOS>
there
be
doubtless
some
who
can
assume
it
without
feel
,
 
as
there
be
actor
who
can
personate
all
the
passion
.
<EOS>
but
in
ordinary
life
we
think
that
we
can
trust
such
a
face
,
and
that
we
know
the
true
look
when
we
see
it
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he

into
Madame

make

next

she

repeat
her

she

in

<EOS>
She
pause
a
moment
as
though
for
an
answer
,
and
he
feel
that
now
have
come
the
time
in
which
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
tell
her
of
his
engagement
with
his
own
Mary
.
<EOS>
She
have
receive
him
very
playfully
;
but
now
within
the
last
few
minute
there
have
come
upon
her
a
seriousness
of
gesture
,
and
almost
a
solemnity
of
tone
,
which
make
him
conscious
that
he
should
in
no
way
trifle
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
earnest
in
her
friendship
that
he
owe
it
to
her
to
tell
her
everything
.
<EOS>
but
before
he
could
think
of
the
word
in
which
his
tale
should
be
tell
,
she
have
go
on
with
her
quick
question
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
it
solely
about
money
that
you
fear
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
simply
that
I
have
no
income
on
which
to
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
I
not
offer
you
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Madame
Goesler
,
you
who
offer
it
would
yourself
despise
me
if
I
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
I
do
deny
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
she
say
this
,
 
not
loudly
but
with
much
emphasis
,
 
she
come
and
stand
before
him
where
he
be
sit
.
<EOS>
and
as
he
look
at
her
he
could
perceive
that
there
be
a
strength
about
her
of
which
he
have
not
be
aware
.
<EOS>
She
be
strong
,
large
,
more
robust
physically
than
he
have
hitherto
conceive

<EOS>
"
I
do
deny
it
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
money
be
neither

may
pass

no

tempt

or
what

will
declare

have
no
force

<EOS>
the
very
air
of
the
room
in
which
she
dwelt
be
sweet
in
his
nostril

there
hover
around
her
an
halo
of
grace

beauty

greet

She
invite
him

how
would
the
Ratlers
and
the
Bonteens
envy
him
when
they
hear
of
the
prize

have
become
his

<EOS>
the
Cantrips
and
the
Greshams
would
feel
that
he
be
a
friend
doubly
valuable

if
he
could
be
win
back

Mr.

would
greet
him
as
a
fitting
ally

an
ally
strong

strength

he
have
before
want

with
whom
would
he
not

equal

whom
need
he
fear

<EOS>
the
story
of
his
poor
Mary
would
be
know
only

small
village

out
beyond
the
Channel

the
temptation
certainly
be
very
strong

have
not

to
doubt

a
woman
's
hand
?
  
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
call
friend
by
you
no
more
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
call
me
Marie
,
your
own
Marie
,
or
you
must
never
call
me
by
any
name
again
.
<EOS>
which
shall
it
be
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
He
pause
a
moment
,
hold
her
hand
,
and
she
let
it
lie
there
for
an
instant
while
she
listen
.
<EOS>
but
still
she
do
not
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
speak
to
me
!
<EOS>
tell
me
!
<EOS>
which
shall
it
be
?
"
<EOS>
still
he
pause
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
tell
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
as
you
have
hint
to
me
,
"
he
say
at
last
.
<EOS>
His
word
do
not
come
louder
than
a
low
whisper
;
but
they
be
plainly
hear
,
and
instantly
the
hand
be
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
"
can
not
be
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
then
I
have
betray
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
;
I
say
yes
!
<EOS>
if
you
will
allow
me
I
will
leave
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
,
I
know
,
excuse
me
if
I
be
abrupt
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
stride
out
of
the
room
,
and
be
no
more
see
of
the
eye
of
Phineas
Finn
.
  
<EOS>
He
never
afterwards
know
how
he
escape
out
of
that
room
and
find
his
way
into
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
in
after
day
he
have
some
memory
that
he
remain
there
,
he
know
not
how
long
,
stand
on
the
very
spot
on
which
she
have
leave
him
;
and
that
at
last
there
grow
upon
him
almost
a
fear
of
move
,
a
dread
lest
he
should
be
hear
,
an
inordinate
desire
to
escape
without
the
sound
of
a
footfall
,
without
the
clicking
of
a
lock
.
<EOS>
everything
in
that
house
have
be
offer
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
refuse
it
all
,
and
then
feel
that
of
all
human
being
under
the
sun
none
have
so
little
right
to
be
stand
there
as
he
.
<EOS>
His
very
presence
in
that
drawing
-
room
be
an
insult
to
the
woman
whom
he
have
drive
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
length
he
be
in
the
street
,
and
have
find
his
way
across
piccadilly
into
the
Green
Park
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
soon
as
he
could
find
a
spot
apart
from
the
Sunday
world
,
he
throw
himself
upon
the
turf
;
and
try
to
fix
his
thought
upon
the
thing
that
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
His
first
feeling
,
I
think
,
be
one
of
pure
and
unmixed
disappointment
;
 
of
disappointment
so
bitter
,
that
even
the
vision
of
his
own
Mary
do
not
tend
to
comfort
him
.
<EOS>
how
great
may
have
be
his
success
,
and
how
terrible
be
his
failure
!
<EOS>
have
he
take
the
woman
's
hand
and
her
money
,
have
he
clench
his
grasp
on
the
great
prize
offer
to
him
,
his
misery
would
have
be
ten
time
bad
the
first
moment
that
he
would
have
be
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
then
,
indeed
,
 
it
be
so
that
he
be
a
man
with
a
heart
within
his
breast
<EOS>
,
 
there
would
have
be
no
comfort
for
him
,
in
his
outlook
on
any
side
.
<EOS>
but
even
now
,
when
he
have
do
right
,
 
know
well
that
he
have
do
right
,
 
he
find
that
comfort
do
not
come
readily
within
his
reach
.

Amantium
Iræ
 
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
's
life
at
this
time
be
not
the
happy
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Her
line
,
as
she
once
say
to
her
friend
Lady
Laura
,
be
not
lay
for
her
in
pleasant
place
.
<EOS>
Her
residence
be
still
with
her
aunt
,
and
she
have
come
to
find
that
it
be
almost
impossible
any
longer
to
endure
Lady
Baldock
,
and
quite
impossible
to
escape
from
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
in
former
day
she
have
have
a
dream
that
she
may
escape
,
and
live
alone
if
she
choose
to
be
alone
;
that
she
may
be
independent
in
her
life
,
as
a
man
be
independent
,
if
she
choose
to
live
after
that
fashion
;
that
she
may
take
her
own
fortune
in
her
own
hand
,
as
the
law
certainly
allow
her
to
do
,
and
act
with
it
as
she
may
please
.
<EOS>
but
latterly
she
have
learn
to
understand
that
all
this
be
not
possible
for
her
.
<EOS>
though
one
law
allow
it
,
another
law
disallow
it
,
and
the
latter
law
be
at
least
as
powerful
as
the
former
.
<EOS>
and
then
her
present
misery
be
enhance
by
the
fact
that
she
be
now
banish
from
the
second
home
which
she
have
formerly
possess
.
<EOS>
hitherto
<EOS>
she
have
always
be
able
to
escape
from
Lady
Baldock
to
the
house
of
her
friend
,
but
now
such
escape
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
and
Lord
Chiltern
live
in
the
same
house
,
and
Violet
could
not
live
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
understand
all
this
,
and
torture
her
niece
accordingly
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
premeditate
torture
.
<EOS>
the
aunt
do
not
mean
to
make
her
niece
's
life
a
burden
to
her
,
and
,
so
intend
,
systematically
work
upon
a
principle
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
,
no
doubt
,
desire
to
do
her
duty
conscientiously
.
<EOS>
but
the
result
be
torture
to
poor
Violet
,
and
a
strong
conviction
on
the
mind
of
each
of
the
two
lady
that
the
other
be
the
most
unreasonable
be
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
the
aunt
,
in
these
day
,
have
take
it
into
her
head
to
talk
of
poor
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
this
arise
partly
from
a
belief
that
the
quarrel
be
final
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
there
would
be
no
danger
in
aggravate
Violet
by
this
expression
of
pity
,
 
partly
from
a
feeling
that
it
would
be
well
that
her
niece
should
marry
Lord
Chiltern
than
that
she
should
not
marry
at
all
,
 
and
partly
,
perhaps
,
from
the
general
principle
that
,
as
she
think
it
right
to
scold
her
niece
on
all
occasion
,
this
may
be
best
do
by
take
an
opposite
view
of
all
question
to
that
take
by
the
niece
to
be
scold
.
<EOS>
Violet
be
suppose
to
regard
Lord
Chiltern
as
have
sin
against
her
,
and
therefore
Lady
Baldock
talk
of
"
poor
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
to
the
other
lover
,
she
have
begin
to
perceive
that
their
condition
be
hopeless
.
<EOS>
Her
daughter
Augusta
have
explain
to
her
that
there
be
no
chance
remain
either
for
Phineas
,
or
for
Lord
Fawn
,
or
for
Mr.
Appledom
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
will
be
an
old
maid
,
on
purpose
to
bring
me
to
my
grave
,
"
say
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
Lady
Baldock
be
tell
one
day
that
Lord
Chiltern
be
in
the
house
,
and
be
ask
to
see
Miss
Effingham
<EOS>
,
she
do
not
at
once
faint
away
,
and
declare
that
they
would
all
be
murder
,
 
as
she
would
have
do
some
month
since
.
<EOS>
She
be
perplex
by
a
double
duty
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
possible
that
Violet
should
relent
and
be
reconcile
,
then
it
would
be
her
duty
to
save
Violet
from
the
claws
of
the
wild
beast
.
<EOS>
but
if
there
be
no
such
chance
,
then
it
would
be
her
duty
to
poor
Lord
Chiltern
to
see
that
he
be
not
treat
with
contumely
and
ill
-
humour
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
know
that
he
be
here
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
ask
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
yet
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
ought
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
give
him
so
much
encouragement
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
will
do
as
she
please
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Augusta
,
how
can
you
talk
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
be
I
to
have
no
control
in
my
own
house
?
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
however
,
soon
apparent
to
her
that
in
this
matter
she
be
to
have
no
control
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Chiltern
be
down
-
stair
,
"
say
Violet
,
come
into
the
room
abruptly
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
Augusta
tell
me
.
<EOS>
sit
down
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
sit
down
,
aunt
,
 
not
just
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
send
down
to
say
that
I
would
be
with
him
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
most
impatient
soul
alive
,
and
I
must
not
keep
him
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
mean
to
see
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
I
shall
see
him
,
"
say
Violet
,
as
she
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
that
any
woman
should
ever
take
upon
herself
the
charge
of
a
niece
!
"
say
Lady
Baldock
to
her
daughter
in
a
despondent
tone
,
as
she
hold
up
her
hand
in
dismay
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
Violet
have
go
down
-
stair
with
a
quick
step
,
and
have
then
boldly
enter
the
room
in
which
her
lover
be
wait
to
receive
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
thank
you
for
come
to
me
,
Violet
,
"
say
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
there
be
still
in
his
face
something
of
savagery
,
 
an
expression
partly
of
anger
and
partly
of
resolution
to
tame
the
thing
with
which
he
be
angry
.
<EOS>
Violet
do
not
regard
the
anger
half
so
keenly
as
she
do
that
resolution
of
taming
.
<EOS>
an
angry
lord
,
she
think
,
she
could
endure
,
but
she
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
be
tame
by
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
not
come
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
come
when
I
be
tell
that
you
be
here
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
there
need
be
a
quarrel
between
us
,
because
we
have
change
our
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
such
change
make
quarrel
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
not
do
so
with
me
,
unless
you
choose
that
it
shall

say
Violet

<EOS>
"
why
should
we
be
enemy

we
who
have

My

why

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
Ill

<EOS>
"
no

then
why
do
you

I
do

oh

you

so

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
believe

the
harsh

I
do
not

if

I
will
beg
your
pardon

only
let
there
be
an
end

<EOS>
as
we
think
so
differently
about
life
in
general
,
it
be
well
that
we
should
not
be
married
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
settle
,
and
why
should
we
go
back
to
word
that
be
speak
in
haste

which
be
simply
disagreeable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
know
whether
it
be
settle

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
certainly
.
<EOS>
You
settle
it
yourself
,
Oswald
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
I
think
myself
bind
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
use
language
which
I
should
not
have
use
.
<EOS>
then
you
tell
me
that
I
could
not
be
your
wife
;
 
and
I
think
you
be
right
,
quite
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
wrong
,
quite
wrong

"
he
say
impetuously
.
"
<EOS>
so
wrong
,
that
I
can
never
forgive
myself

if
you
do
not
relent

<EOS>
I
be
such
a
fool

that
I
can
not

myself
my
folly

<EOS>
I
have
know
before
that
I
could
not
live
without
you

when
you
be
mine

I
throw
you
away
for
an
angry
word

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
an
angry
word
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
say
it
again
,

let
me
have
another
chance

answer
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
say
that
idleness
be
not

respectable
,
or
something
like
that

take
out
of
a
copy

book
probably
.
<EOS>
but
you
be
a
man
who
do
not
like
rebuke
,
even
out

copy

book

<EOS>
a
man
so
thin

mine

<EOS>
"
I
will
choose

he

still
he
be
savage
in
his
tone

in
his
gesture

I
make
my
choice

you
know
well
enough

I
do
not

I
can
not

<EOS>
Violet

say
that
you
will
be
my

once
more
,
and
I
will
swear
to
work
for
you
like
a
coal

heaver

"
  
<EOS>
"
My
wish
be
that
my

one

<EOS>
"
come
,
Violet

he
say
,

<EOS>
now
the
look
of
savagery
depart
from
him
,
and
there
come
a
smile
over
his
face
,
which
,
however

Oswald

you

her

I
wash
my

of
it

"
<EOS>
that
evening
,
when
she
discuss
the
matter
with
her
daughter
,
Lady
Baldock
speak
of
Violet
and
Lord
Chiltern
,
as
though
their
intend
marriage
be
the
one
thing
in
the
world
which
she
most
deplored
.
   
<EOS>
the
beginning
of
the
end
 
<EOS>
the
day
of
the
debate
have
come
,
and
Phineas
Finn
be
still
sit
in
his
room
at
the
Colonial
Office
.
<EOS>
but
his
resignation
have
be
send
in
and
accept
,
and
he
be
simply
await
the
coming
of
his
successor
.
<EOS>
about
noon
his
successor
come
,
and
he
have
the
gratification
of
resign
his
arm
-
chair
to
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
It
be
generally
understand
that
gentleman
leave
office
give
up
either
seal
or
a
portfolio
.
<EOS>
Phineas
have
be
put
in
possession
of
no
seal
and
no
portfolio
;
but
there
be
in
the
room
which
he
have
occupy
a
special
arm
-
chair
,
and
this
with
much
regret
he
surrender
to
the
use
and
comfort
of
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
glance
of
triumph
in
his
enemy
's
eye
,
and
an
exultation
in
the
tone
of
his
enemy
's
voice
,
which
be
very
bitter
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
so
you
be
really
go
?
"
say
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
;
I
dare
say
it
be
all
very
proper
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
understand
the
thing
myself
,
but
I
have
no
doubt
you
be
right
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
easy
to
understand
;
be
it
?
"
say
Phineas
,
try
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Bonteen
do
not
feel
the
intended
satire
,
and
poor
Phineas
find
it
useless
to
attempt
to
punish
the
man
he
hate
.
<EOS>
He
leave
him
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
and
go
to
say
a
few
word
of
farewell
to
his
late
chief
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
bye
,
Finn
,
"
say
Lord
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
great
trouble
to
me
that
we
should
have
to
part
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
to
me
also
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
could
have
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
have
go
to
Ireland
with
so
dangerous
a
man
as
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
too
late
to
think
of
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
milk
be
spilt
;
be
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
these
terrible
rending
asunder
never
last
very
long
,
"
say
Lord
Cantrip
,
"
unless
a
man
change
his
opinion
altogether
.
<EOS>
how
many
quarrel
and
how
many
reconciliation
we
have
live
to
see
!
<EOS>
I
remember
when
Gresham
go
out
of
office
,
because
he
could
not
sit
in
the
same
room
with
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
yet
they
become
the
fast
of
political
friend
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
time
when
Plinlimmon
and
the
Duke
could
not
stable
their
horse
together
at
all
;
and
do
not
you
remember
when
Palliser
be
oblige
to
give
up
his
hope
of
office
because
he
have
some
bee
in
his
bonnet
?
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
however
,
that
the
bee
in
Mr.
Palliser
's
bonnet
to
which
Lord
Cantrip
be
allude
make
its
buzzing
audible
on
some
subject
that
be
not
exactly
political
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
you
back
again
before
long
,
I
do
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
man
who
can
really
do
their
work
be
too
rare
to
be
leave
long
in
the
comfort
of
the
bench
below
the
gangway
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
kindly
say
,
and
Phineas
be
flatter
and
comfort
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
however
,
make
Lord
Cantrip
understand
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
for
him
the
dream
of
a
life
of
politic
be
over
for
ever
.
<EOS>
He
have
try
it
,
and
have
succeed
beyond
his
utmost
hope
;
but
,
in
spite
of
his
success
,
the
ground
have
crumble
to
piece
beneath
his
foot
,
and
he
know
that
he
could
never
recover
the
niche
in
the
world
's
gallery
which
he
be
now
leave
.
  
<EOS>
that
same
afternoon
he
meet
Mr.
Gresham
in
one
of
the
passage
lead
to
the
House
,
and
the
Prime
Minister
put
his
arm
through
that
of
our
hero
as
they
walk
together
into
the
lobby
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
that
we
be
lose
you
,
"
say
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
sure
that
I
be
sorry
to
be
so
lost
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
these
thing
will
occur
in
political
life
,
"
say
the
leader
;
"
but
I
think
that
they
seldom
leave
rancour
behind
them
when
the
purpose
be
declare
,
and
when
the
subject
of
disagreement
be
mark
and
understand
.
<EOS>
the
defalcation
which
create
angry
feeling
be
that
which
have
to
be
endure
without
previous
warning
,
 
when
a
man
vote
against
his
party
,
 
or
a
set
of
man
,
from
private
pique
or
from
some
cause
which
be
never
clear
.
"
<EOS>
Phineas
,
when
he
hear
this
,
know
well
how
terribly
this
very
man
have
be
harass
,
and
drive
nearly
wild
,
by
defalcation
,
exactly
of
that
nature
which
he
be
attempt
to
describe
.
"
<EOS>
no
doubt
you
and
Mr.
Monk
think
you
be
right
,
"
continue
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
give
strong
evidence
that
we
think
so
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
We
give
up
our
place
,
and
we
be
,
both
of
us
,
very
poor
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
wrong
,
you
know
,
not
so
much
in
your
view
on
the
question
itself
 
which
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
hardly
understand
as
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
endeavour
to
explain
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
will
do
so
very
clearly
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
that
Mr.
Monk
be
wrong
in
desire
,
as
a
member
of
a
Government
,
to
force
a
measure
which
,
whether
good
or
bad
,
the
Government
as
a
body
do
not
desire
to
initiate
,
 
at
any
rate
,
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
therefore
he
resign
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
to
me
that
he
fail
to
comprehend
the
only
way
in
which
a
great
party
can
act
together
,
if
it
be
to
do
any
service
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
do
not
for
a
moment
think
that
I
be
blame
him
or
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
nobody
in
this
matter
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
assure
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
that
we
have
not
regard
you
in
that
light
,
and
I
hope
that
the
time
may
come
when
we
may
be
sit
together
again
on
the
same
bench
.
"
  
<EOS>
neither
on
the
Treasury
bench
nor
on
any
other
in
that
House
be
he
to
sit
again
after
this
fashion
!
<EOS>
that
be
the
trouble
which
be
crush
his
spirit
at
this
moment
,
and
not
the
loss
of
his
office
!
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
could
not
venture
to
think
of
remain
in
London
as
a
member
of
Parliament
with
no
other
income
than
that
which
his
father
could
allow
him
,
even
if
he
could
again
secure
a
seat
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
first
be
return
for
Loughshane
he
have
assure
his
friend
that
his
duty
as
a
member
of
the
House
of
Commons
would
not
be
a
bar
to
his
practice
in
the
Courts
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
be
five
year
a
member
,
and
have
never
once
make
an
attempt
at
do
any
part
of
a
barrister
's
work
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
altogether
into
a
different
line
of
life
,
and
have
be
most
successful
;
 
so
successful
that
man
tell
him
,
and
woman
more
frequently
than
man
,
that
his
career
have
be
a
miracle
of
success
.
<EOS>
but
there
have
be
,
as
he
have
well
know
from
the
first
,
this
drawback
in
the
new
profession
which
he
have
choose
,
that
nothing
in
it
could
be
permanent
.
<EOS>
They
who
succeed
in
it
,
may
probably
succeed
again
;
but
then
the
success
be
intermittent
,
and
there
may
be
year
of
hard
work
in
opposition
,
to
which
,
unfortunately
,
no
pay
be
assign
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
imperative
,
as
he
now
find
,
that
they
who
devote
themselves
to
such
a
profession
should
be
man
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
commence
his
work
,
 
at
the
period
of
his
first
return
for
Loughshane
,
 
he
have
have
no
thought
of
mend
his
deficiency
in
this
respect
by
a
rich
marriage
.
<EOS>
nor
have
it
ever
occur
to
him
that
he
would
seek
a
marriage
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
such
an
idea
would
have
be
thoroughly
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
stain
of
premeditated
mercenary
arrangement
upon
him
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
but
circumstance
have
so
fall
out
with
him
,
that
as
he
win
his
spur
in
Parliament
,
as
he
become
know
,
and
be
place
first
in
one
office
and
then
in
another
,
prospect
of
love
and
money
together
be
open
to
him
,
and
he
venture
on
,
leave
Mr.
Low
and
the
law
behind
him
,
 
because
these
prospect
be
so
alluring
.
<EOS>
then
have
come
Mr.
Monk
and
Mary
Flood
Jones
,
 
and
everything
around
him
have
collapse
.
  
<EOS>
everything
around
him
have
collapse
,
 
with
,
however
,
a
terrible
temptation
to
him
to
inflate
his
sail
again
,
at
the
cost
of
his
truth
and
his
honour
.
<EOS>
the
temptation
would
have
affect
him
not
at
all
,
have
Madame
Goesler
be
ugly
,
stupid
,
or
personally
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
,
he
think
,
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
have
ever
see
,
the
most
witty
,
and
in
many
respect
the
most
charming
.
<EOS>
She
have
offer
to
give
him
everything
that
she
have
,
so
to
place
him
in
the
world
that
opposition
would
be
more
pleasant
to
him
than
office
,
to
supply
every
want
,
and
have
do
so
in
a
manner
that
have
gratify
all
his
vanity
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
refuse
it
all
,
because
he
be
bind
to
the
girl
at
Floodborough
.
<EOS>
My
reader
will
probably
say
that
he
be
not
a
true
man
unless
he
could
do
this
without
a
regret
.
<EOS>
when
Phineas
think
of
it
all
,
there
be
many
regret
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
at
the
same
time
a
resolve
on
his
part
,
that
if
any
man
have
ever
love
the
girl
he
promise
to
love
,
he
would
love
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
time
he
have
tell
himself
that
she
have
not
the
spirit
of
Lady
Laura
,
or
the
bright
wit
of
Violet
Effingham
,
or
the
beauty
of
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
but
Mary
have
charm
of
her
own
that
be
more
valuable
than
them
all
.
<EOS>
be
there
one
among
the
three
who
have
trust
him
as
she
trust
him
,
 
or
love
him
with
the
same
satisfied
devotion
?
<EOS>
there
be
regret
,
regret
that
be
heavy
on
his
heart
;
 
for
London
,
and
Parliament
,
and
the
club
,
and
Downing
Street
,
have
become
dear
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
like
to
think
of
himself
as
he
ride
in
the
park
,
and
be
greet
by
all
those
whose
greeting
be
the
most
worth
have
.
<EOS>
there
be
regret
,
 
sad
regret
.
<EOS>
but
the
girl
whom
he
love
better
than
the
park
and
the
club
,
 
better
even
than
Westminster
and
Downing
Street
,
should
never
know
that
they
have
exist
.
  
<EOS>
these
thought
be
run
through
his
mind
even
while
he
be
listen
to
Mr.
Monk
,
as
he
propound
his
theory
of
do
justice
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
this
may
probably
be
the
last
great
debate
in
which
Phineas
would
be
able
to
take
a
part
,
and
he
be
determine
that
he
would
do
his
good
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
intend
to
speak
on
this
day
,
if
,
as
be
generally
suppose
,
the
House
would
be
adjourn
before
a
division
could
be
obtain
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
remain
on
the
alert
and
see
how
the
thing
go
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
to
understand
the
form
of
the
place
,
and
be
as
well
-
train
a
young
member
of
Parliament
as
any
there
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
quick
at
learn
a
lesson
that
be
not
easily
learn
,
and
know
how
thing
be
go
,
and
what
be
the
proper
moment
for
this
question
or
that
form
of
motion
.
<EOS>
He
could
anticipate
a
count
-
out
,
understand
the
tone
of
man
's
mind
,
and
could
read
the
gesture
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
little
likely
that
the
debate
should
be
over
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
;
and
as
the
present
time
be
the
evening
of
Tuesday
,
he
resolve
at
once
that
he
would
speak
as
early
as
he
could
on
the
follow
Thursday
.
<EOS>
what
a
pity
it
be
,
that
with
one
who
have
learn
so
much
,
all
his
learning
should
be
in
vain
!
  
<EOS>
at
about
two
o'clock
,
he
himself
succeed
in
move
the
adjournment
of
the
debate
.
<EOS>
this
he
do
from
a
seat
below
the
gangway
,
to
which
he
have
remove
himself
from
the
Treasury
bench
.
<EOS>
then
the
House
be
up
,
and
he
walk
home
with
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
,
since
he
have
be
tell
positively
by
Phineas
that
he
have
resolve
upon
resign
his
office
,
have
say
nothing
more
of
his
sorrow
at
his
friend
's
resolve
,
but
have
use
him
as
one
political
friend
use
another
,
tell
him
all
his
thought
and
all
his
hope
as
to
this
new
measure
of
his
,
and
take
counsel
with
him
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
fight
should
be
fight
.
<EOS>
together
they
have
count
over
the
list
of
member
,
mark
these
man
as
supporter
,
those
as
opponent
,
and
another
set
,
now
more
important
than
either
,
as
be
doubtful
.
<EOS>
from
day
to
day
those
who
have
be
write
down
as
doubtful
be
strike
off
that
third
list
,
and
put
in
either
the
one
or
the
other
of
those
who
be
either
supporter
or
opponent
.
<EOS>
and
their
different
mode
of
argument
be
settle
between
these
two
ally
orator
,
<EOS>
how
one
should
take
this
line
and
the
other
that
.
<EOS>
to
Mr.
Monk
this
be
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
assured
now
that
opposition
be
more
congenial
to
his
spirit
,
and
more
fitting
for
him
than
office
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
to
him
as
to
his
future
sit
in
Parliament
,
let
the
result
of
this
contest
be
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
the
work
which
he
be
now
do
,
be
the
work
for
which
he
have
be
train
himself
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
while
he
have
be
force
to
attend
Cabinet
Councils
from
week
to
week
,
he
have
be
depress
.
<EOS>
now
he
be
exultant
.
<EOS>
phinea
see
and
understand
all
this
,
say
<EOS>
but
little
to
his
friend
of
his
own
prospect
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
this
pleasant
battle
be
rage
,
he
could
fight
in
it
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
man
he
love
.
<EOS>
after
that
there
would
be
a
blank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
how
we
be
to
fail
to
have
a
majority
after
Daubeny
's
speech
to
-
night
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
,
as
they
walk
together
down
Parliament
Street
through
the
bright
moonlight
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
expressly
say
that
he
only
speak
for
himself
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
we
know
what
that
mean
.
<EOS>
He
be
bid
for
office
,
and
of
course
those
who
want
office
with
him
will
vote
as
he
vote
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
count
those
who
would
go
into
office
,
but
they
will
not
carry
the
whole
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
carry
enough
of
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
forty
or
fifty
man
on
his
side
of
the
House
,
and
as
many
perhaps
on
ours
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
,
"
who
have
no
idea
of
any
kind
on
any
bill
,
and
who
simply
follow
the
bell
,
whether
into
this
lobby
or
that
.
<EOS>
argument
never
touch
them
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
even
look
to
the
result
of
a
division
on
their
own
interest
,
as
the
making
of
any
calculation
would
be
laborious
to
them
.
<EOS>
Their
party
leader
be
to
them
a
Pope
whom
they
do
not
dream
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
never
can
quite
make
up
my
mind
whether
it
be
good
or
bad
that
there
should
be
such
man
in
Parliament
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
man
who
think
much
want
to
speak
often
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exactly
so
,
 
and
of
speak
member
,
God
know
that
we
have
enough
.
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
that
these
purblind
sheep
do
have
some
occult
weight
that
be
salutary
.
<EOS>
They
enable
a
leader
to
be
a
leader
,
and
even
in
that
way
they
be
useful
.
<EOS>
We
shall
get
a
division
on
Thursday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
that
Gresham
have
consent
to
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
Ratler
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Palliser
be
to
speak
,
and
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
and
they
say
that
Robson
be
go
to
make
an
onslaught
specially
on
me
.
<EOS>
We
shall
get
it
over
by
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
if
we
beat
them
?
"
ask
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
depend
on
the
number
.
<EOS>
everybody
who
have
speak
to
me
about
it
,
seem
to
think
that
they
will
dissolve
if
there
be
a
respectable
majority
against
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
will
dissolve
,
"
say
Phineas
,
speak
of
Mr.
Gresham
;
"
what
else
can
he
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
anxious
to
carry
his
irish
Reform
Bill
first
,
if
he
can
do
so
.
<EOS>
good
-
night
,
Phineas
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
down
to
-
morrow
as
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
come
to
me
on
Thursday
,
and
we
will
go
to
the
House
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
Wednesday
Phineas
be
engage
to
dine
with
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
dinner
party
in
Bedford
Square
,
and
Phineas
meet
half
-
a
-
dozen
barrister
and
their
wife
,
 
man
to
whom
he
have
look
up
as
successful
pundit
in
the
law
some
five
or
six
year
ago
,
but
who
since
that
time
have
almost
learn
to
look
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
now
they
treat
him
with
that
courteousness
of
manner
which
success
in
life
always
beget
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
judge
there
who
be
very
civil
to
him
;
and
the
judge
's
wife
whom
he
have
take
down
to
dinner
be
very
gracious
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
judge
have
get
his
prize
in
life
,
and
be
therefore
personally
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
minister
;
but
the
judge
's
wife
have
a
brother
who
want
a
County
Court
from
Lord
De
Terrier
,
and
it
be
know
that
Phineas
be
give
valuable
assistance
towards
the
attainment
of
this
object
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
that
you
and
Mr.
Monk
be
so
right
,
"
say
the
judge
's
wife
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
understand
how
it
come
to
pass
that
the
judge
's
wife
should
so
cordially
approve
his
conduct
,
could
not
help
think
how
grand
a
thing
it
would
be
for
him
to
have
a
County
Court
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
guest
be
go
he
be
leave
alone
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Low
,
and
remain
awhile
with
them
,
there
have
be
an
understanding
that
they
should
have
a
last
chat
together
over
the
affair
of
our
hero
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
really
mean
that
you
will
not
stand
again
?
"
ask
Mrs.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
mean
it
.
<EOS>
I
may
say
that
I
can
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
hardly
so
well
able
to
help
me
as
he
be
when
I
begin
this
game
,
and
I
certainly
shall
not
ask
him
for
money
to
support
a
canvass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
thousand
pity
,
"
say
Mrs.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
have
begin
to
think
that
you
would
make
it
answer
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
one
way
I
have
make
it
answer
.
<EOS>
for
the
last
three
year
I
have
live
upon
what
I
have
earn
,
and
I
be
not
in
debt
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
must
begin
the
world
again
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
shall
find
the
drudgery
very
hard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
hard
no
doubt
,
"
say
the
barrister
,
who
have
go
through
it
all
,
and
be
now
reap
the
fruit
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
you
have
not
forget
what
you
learn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
can
say
?
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
have
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
mean
the
drudgery
of
learning
,
so
much
as
the
drudgery
of
look
after
work
;
 
of
expect
brief
which
perhaps
will
never
come
.
<EOS>
I
be
thirty
year
old
now
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
indeed
?
"
say
Mrs.
Low
,
 
who
know
his
age
to
a
day
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
the
time
pass
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
hope
you
will
get
on
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
will
,
if
he
put
his
shoulder
to
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
neither
the
lawyer
nor
his
wife
repeat
any
of
those
sententious
admonition
,
which
have
almost
become
rebuke
,
and
which
have
be
so
common
in
their
mouth
.
<EOS>
the
fall
with
which
they
have
threaten
Phineas
Finn
have
come
upon
him
,
and
they
be
too
generous
to
remind
him
of
their
wisdom
and
sagacity
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
when
he
get
up
to
take
his
leave
,
Mrs.
Low
,
who
probably
may
not
see
him
again
for
year
,
be
quite
affectionate
in
her
manner
to
him
,
and
look
as
if
she
be
almost
minded
to
kiss
him
as
she
press
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
come
and
see
you
,
"
she
say
,
"
when
you
be
Master
of
the
Rolls
in
Dublin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
him
before
then
thunder
at
us
poor
Tories
in
the
House
,
"
say
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
back
again
sooner
or
later

<EOS>
and
so
they
part

on
the
Thursday
morning
before
Phineas
go
to
Mr.
Monk
,
a
gentleman
call
upon
him
at
his
lodging
.
<EOS>
Phineas
request
the
servant
to
bring
up
the
gentleman
's
name
,
but
tempt
perhaps
by
a
shill
the
girl
bring
up
the
gentleman
instead
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
from
the
office
of
the

Banner

the
People
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Finn
,
"
say
Quintus
,
with
his
hand
extend
,
"
I
have
come
to
offer
you
the
calumet
of
peace
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
certainly
desire
no
such
calumet
.
<EOS>
but
to
refuse
a
man
's
hand
be
to
declare
active
war
after
a
fashion
which
man
do
not
like
to
adopt
except
on
deliberation
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
care
a
straw
for
the
abuse
which
Mr.
Slide
have
pour
upon
him
,
and
now
he
give
his
hand
to
the
man
of
letter
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
sit
down
,
nor
do
he
offer
a
seat
to
Mr.
Slide
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
as
a
man
of
sense
who
know
the
world
,
you
will
accept
the
calumet
of
peace
,
"
continue
Mr.
Slide
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
be
ask
particularly
to
accept
war
or
peace
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mr.
Finn
,
 
I
do
not
often
quote
the
Bible
;
but
those
who
be
not
for
us
must
be
against
us
.
<EOS>
You
will
agree
to
that
.
<EOS>
now
that
you
have
free
yourself
from
the
iniquity
of
that
sink
of
abomination
in
Downing
Street

I
look
upon
you
as
a

"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
you
be
very
kind

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
a
man

also
a

<EOS>
I
suppose
you
know
that
I
have
get
the

and
now

<EOS>
"
Phineas
be
oblige
to
explain
that
he
have
not
hitherto

make
acquainted
with
this
great
literary
and
political
secret

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

yes
,
altogether
so
.
<EOS>
We
have
get
rid
of
old
Rusty
as
I
use
to
call
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
go
the
pace

and
so
we
strip
him

<EOS>
He

and
he

I
hope
he
will
succeed
,
Mr.
Slide

He
will
earn
his

<EOS>
He

a
man

will
always

but
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
well
,
now
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
will
just
offer
you
one
word
of
apology
for
our
little
severity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pray
do
nothing
of
the
kind

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
shall

<EOS>
Dooty
be
dooty

<EOS>
there
be
some
thing

which
be
a
little
rough

but
if
one
be
not
a
little
rough
there
be
not
no
flavour

<EOS>
of
course
I
write
'em

You
know
my

and
,
I
dare
say

<EOS>

I
only
remember
that
there
be
some
throwing
of
mud
.

<EOS>
just
so
.
<EOS>
but
mud
do
not
break
any
bone

do
it

<EOS>
when
you
turn
against
us
I
have
to
be
down
on
you
,
and
I
be
down
upon
you
;
 
<EOS>
that
be
just
about
all
of
it

<EOS>
now
you
be
come
among
us
again
,
and
so
I
come
to
you
with
a
calumet

I

<EOS>
"
yes
you

Finn

and
bring
Monk
with
you

<EOS>
"
It
be
now
become
very
disagreeable
,
and
Phineas
be
begin
to
perceive
that
it
would
soon
be
his
turn
to
say
something
rough
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
now
I
will
tell
you

<EOS>
if

have
a
cheque

if
that

honester
money

Mr.

We
be
not

I
do
not

thing
to
go
easy

I
believe
you
say
some
thing
of
me
in
your
newspaper
that
be
very
scurrilous

<EOS>

what
of
that

if
you
mind
that
sort
of
thing

"
I
do
not
regard
it
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
You
be
quite
welcome
to
continue
it

<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
you
will
continue
it

<EOS>
but
you
be
not
welcome
to
come
here
afterwards

do
you
mean
to
turn
me
out

just
that

You
print
a
heap

Mr.

I

lie

<EOS>
and
Phineas
walk
over
at
him
as
though
he
be
go
to
pitch
him
instantly
out
of
the
window

<EOS>
"
You
may
go
and
write

many
more

It

your
trade

you
must
do
it

starve

do
not

again

"
then
he
open
the
door

stand
with
it
in

hand

<EOS>
"
very
well
,
sir

<EOS>
I
shall
know
how
to
punish
this
.
<EOS>

"
<EOS>
exactly
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
please
you
will
go
and
do
your
punishment
at
the
office
of
the
_
Banner
_
,
 
unless
you
like
to
try
it
here
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
kick
me
and
spit
at
me
,

you
will
prefer
to
do
it
in
print

<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
say
Quintus
Slide
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
prefer
to
do
it
in
print
,
 
though
I
must
own
that
the
temptation
to
adopt
the
manual
violence
of
a
ruffian
be
great
,
very
great
,
very
great
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
but
he
resist
the
temptation
and
walk
down
the
stair
,
concoct
his
article
as
he
go
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
do
not
so
much
impede
the
business
of
his
day
but
what
Phineas
be
with
Mr.
Monk
by
two
,
and
in
his
place
in
the
House
when
prayer
be
read
at
four
.
<EOS>
as
he
sit
in
his
place
,
conscious
of
the
work
that
be
before
him
,
listen
to
the
presentation
of
petition
,
and
to
the
formal
reading
of
certain
notice
of
motion
,
which
with
the
asking
of
sundry
question
occupy
over
half
an
hour
,
he
look
back
and
remember
accurately
his
own
feeling
on
a
certain
night
on
which
he
have
intend
to
get
up
and
address
the
House
.
<EOS>
the
ordeal
before
him
have
then
be
so
terrible
,
that
it
have
almost
obliterate
for
the
moment
his
sense
of
hearing
and
of
sight
.
<EOS>
He
have
hardly
be
able
to
perceive
what
have
be
go
on
around
him
,
and
have
vainly
endeavour
to
occupy
himself
in
recall
to
his
memory
the
word
which
he
wish
to
pronounce
.
<EOS>
when
the
time
for
pronounce
them
have
come
,
he
have
find
himself
unable
to
stand
upon
his
leg
.
<EOS>
He
smile
as
he
recall
all
this
in
his
memory
,
wait
impatiently
for
the
moment
in
which
he
may
rise
.
<EOS>
His
audience
be
assure
to
him
now
,
and
he
do
not
fear
it
.
<EOS>
His
opportunity
for
utterance
be
his
own
,
and
even
the
Speaker
could
not
deprive
him
of
it
.
<EOS>
during
these
minute
he
think
not
at
all
of
the
word
that
he
be
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
have
prepare
his
matter
but
have
prepare
no
word
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
word
would
come
readily
enough
to
him
,
and
that
he
have
learn
the
task
of
turn
his
thought
quickly
into
language
while
stand
with
a
crowd
of
listener
around
him
,
 
as
a
practised
writer
do
when
seat
in
his
chair
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
violent
beating
at
his
heart
now
,
no
dimness
of
the
eye
,
no
feeling
that
the
ground
be
turn
round
under
his
foot
.
<EOS>
if
only
those
weary
vain
question
would
get
themselves
all
ask
,
so
that
he
may
rise
and
begin
the
work
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
then
there
come
the
last
thought
as
the
House
be
hush
for
his
rising
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
good
of
it
all
,
when
he
would
never
have
an
opportunity
of
speak
there
again
?
  
<EOS>
but
not
on
that
account
would
he
be
slack
in
his
endeavour
now
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
listen
to
once
at
least
,
not
as
a
subaltern
of
the
Government
but
as
the
owner
of
a
voice
prominent
in
opposition
to
the
Government
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
teach
by
Mr.
Monk
that
that
be
the
one
place
in
the
House
in
which
a
man
with
a
power
of
speak
could
really
enjoy
pleasure
without
alloy
.
<EOS>
He
would
make
the
trial
,
 
once
,
if
never
again
.
<EOS>
thing
have
so
go
with
him
that
the
rostrum
be
his
own
,
and
a
House
cram
to
overflow
be
there
to
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
give
up
his
place
in
order
that
he
may
be
able
to
speak
his
mind
,
and
have
become
aware
that
many
intend
to
listen
to
him
while
he
speak
.
<EOS>
He
have
observe
that
the
row
of
stranger
be
thick
in
the
gallery
,
that
peer
be
stand
in
the
passage
,
and
that
over
the
reporter
's
head
,
the
ribbon
of
many
lady
be
to
be
see
through
the
bar
of
their
cage
.
<EOS>
yes
;
 
for
this
once
he
would
have
an
audience
.
  
<EOS>
He
speak
for
about
an
hour
,
and
while
he
be
speak
he
know
nothing
about
himself
,
whether
he
be
do
it
well
or
ill
.
<EOS>
something
of
himself
he
do
say
soon
after
he
have
commence
,
 
not
quite
begin
with
it
,
as
though
his
mind
have
be
laden
with
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
he
say
,
find
himself
compel
to
renounce
his
happy
allegiance
to
the
First
Lord
of
the
Treasury
,
and
to
quit
the
pleasant
company
in
which
,
humble
as
have
be
his
place
,
he
have
be
allow
to
sit
and
act
,
by
his
unfortunate
conviction
in
this
great
subject
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
tell
,
he
say
,
that
it
be
a
misfortune
in
itself
for
one
so
young
as
he
to
have
conviction
.
<EOS>
but
his
irish
birth
and
irish
connection
have
bring
this
misfortune
of
his
country
so
closely
home
to
him
that
he
have
find
the
task
of
extricate
himself
from
it
to
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
of
what
further
he
say
,
speak
on
that
terribly
unintelligible
subject
,
a
tenant
-
right
propose
for
irish
farmer
,
no
english
reader
will
desire
to
know
much
.
<EOS>
irish
subject
in
the
House
of
Commons
be
interesting
or
be
dull
,
be
debate
before
a
crowded
audience
compose
of
all
who
be
leader
in
the
great
world
of
London
,
or
before
empty
bench
,
in
accordance
with
the
importance
of
the
moment
and
the
character
of
the
debate
.
<EOS>
for
us
now
it
be
enough
to
know
that
to
our
hero
be
accord
that
attention
which
orators
love
,
 
which
will
almost
make
an
orator
if
it
can
be
assure
.
<EOS>
a
full
House
with
a
promise
of
big
type
on
the
next
morning
would
wake
to
eloquence
the
propounder
of
a
canadian
grievance
,
or
the
mover
of
an
indian
budget
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
do
not
stir
out
of
the
House
till
the
division
be
over
,
have
agree
with
Mr.
Monk
that
they
two
would
remain
through
it
all
and
hear
everything
that
be
to
be
say
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
have
already
speak
,
and
to
Mr.
Palliser
be
confide
the
task
of
wind
up
the
argument
for
the
Government
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Robson
speak
also
,
greatly
enliven
the
tedium
of
the
evening
,
and
to
Mr.
Monk
be
permit
the
privilege
of
a
final
reply
.
<EOS>
at
two
o'clock
the
division
come
,
and
the
Ministry
be
beat
by
a
majority
of
twenty
-
three
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
,
as
he
again
walk
home
with
Phineas
,
"
the
pity
be
that
we
be
not
a
bit
near
tenant
-
right
than
we
be
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
we
be
nearer
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
one
sense
,
yes
.
<EOS>
such
a
debate
and
such
a
majority
will
make
man
think
.
<EOS>
but
no
;
 
think
be
too
high
a
word
;
as
a
rule
man
do
not
think
.
<EOS>
but
it
will
make
them
believe
that
there
be
something
in
it
.
<EOS>
many
who
before
regard
legislation
on
the
subject
as
chimerical
,
will
now
fancy
that
it
be
only
dangerous
,
or
perhaps
not
more
than
difficult
.
<EOS>
and
so
in
time
it
will
come
to
be
look
on
as
among
the
thing
possible
,
then
among
the
thing
probable
;
 
and
so
at
last
<EOS>
it
will
be
range
in
the
list
of
those
few
measure
which
the
country
require
as
be
absolutely
need
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
way
in
which
public
opinion
be
make
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
loss
of
time
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
to
have
take
the
first
great
step
in
make
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
first
great
step
be
take
long
ago
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
,
 
"
take
by
man
who
be
look
upon
as
revolutionary
demagogue
,
almost
as
traitor
,
because
they
take
it
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
great
thing
to
take
any
step
that
lead
us
onwards
.
"
  
<EOS>
two
day
after
this
Mr.
Gresham
declare
his
intention
of
dissolve
the
House
because
of
the
adverse
division
which
have
be
produce
by
Mr.
Monk
's
motion
,
but
express
a
wish
to
be
allow
to
carry
an
irish
Reform
Bill
through
Parliament
before
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
explain
how
expedient
this
would
be
,
but
declare
at
the
same
time
that
if
any
strong
opposition
be
make
,
he
would
abandon
the
project
.
<EOS>
His
intention
simply
be
to
pass
with
regard
to
Ireland
a
measure
which
must
be
pass
soon
,
and
which
ought
to
be
pass
before
a
new
election
take
place
.
<EOS>
the
bill
be
ready
,
and
should
be
read
for
the
first
time
on
the
next
night
,
if
the
House
be
willing
.
<EOS>
the
House
be
willing
,
though
there
be
very
many
recalcitrant
irish
member
.
<EOS>
the
irish
member
make
loud
opposition
,
and
then
twit
Mr.
Gresham
with
his
promise
that
he
would
not
go
on
with
his
bill
,
if
opposition
be
make
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
do
go
on
,
and
the
measure
be
hurry
through
the
two
Houses
in
a
week
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
who
still
sit
for
Loughshane
,
but
who
be
never
to
sit
for
Loughshane
again
,
give
what
assistance
he
could
to
the
Government
,
and
vote
for
the
measure
which
deprive
Loughshane
for
ever
of
its
parliamentary
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
very
dirty
conduct
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
,
"
say
Lord
Tulla
,
when
he
discuss
the
subject
with
his
agent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
be
put
in
for
the
borough
twice
,
almost
free
of
expense
,
it
be
very
dirty
.
<EOS>
"
It
never
occur
to
Lord
Tulla
that
a
member
of
Parliament
may
feel
himself
oblige
to
vote
on
such
a
subject
in
accordance
with
his
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
this
irish
Reform
Bill
be
scramble
through
the
two
Houses
,
and
then
the
session
be
over
.
<EOS>
the
session
be
over
,
and
they
who
know
anything
of
the
private
concern
of
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
be
aware
that
he
be
about
to
return
to
Ireland
,
and
do
not
intend
to
reappear
on
the
scene
which
have
know
him
so
well
for
the
last
five
year
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
how
sad
it
make
me
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
it
make
me
sad
too
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
try
to
shake
off
the
melancholy
,
and
tell
myself
from
day
to
day
that
it
be
unmanly
.
<EOS>
but
it
get
the
well
of
me
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
quite
certain
that
you
will
come
back
among
us
again
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
everybody
tell
me
so
;
and
yet
I
feel
quite
certain
that
I
shall
never
come
back
<EOS>
,
 
never
come
back
with
a
seat
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
as
my
old
tutor
,
Low
,
have
tell
me
score
of
time
,
I
begin
at
the
wrong
end
.
<EOS>
here
I
be
,
thirty
year
of
age
,
and
I
have
not
a
shilling
in
the
world
,
and
I
do
not
know
how
to
earn
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
for
me
you
would
still
be
receive
ever
so
much
a
year
,
and
all
would
be
pleasant
,
"
say
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
long
would
it
have
last
?
<EOS>
the
first
moment
that
Daubeny
get
the
upper
hand
I
should
have
fall
low
than
I
have
fall
now
.
<EOS>
if
not
this
year
,
it
would
have
be
the
next
.
<EOS>
My
only
comfort
be
in
this
,
 
that
I
have
do
the
thing
myself
,
and
have
not
be
turn
out
.
"
<EOS>
to
the
very
last
,
however
,
Mr.
Monk
continue
to
express
his
opinion
that
Phineas
would
come
back
,
declare
that
he
have
know
no
instance
of
a
young
man
who
have
make
himself
useful
in
Parliament
,
and
then
have
be
allow
to
leave
it
in
early
life
.
  
<EOS>
among
those
of
whom
he
be
bind
to
take
a
special
leave
,
the
member
of
the
family
of
Lord
Brentford
be
,
of
course
,
the
foremost
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
hear
of
the
reconciliation
of
Miss
Effingham
and
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
be
anxious
to
offer
his
congratulation
to
both
of
them
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
essential
to
him
that
he
should
see
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
to
her
he
write
a
line
,
say
how
much
he
hope
that
he
should
be
able
to
bid
her
adieu
,
and
a
time
be
fix
for
his
coming
at
which
she
know
that
she
would
meet
him
alone
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
chance
rule
it
,
he
come
upon
the
two
lover
together
,
and
then
remember
that
he
have
hardly
ever
before
be
in
the
same
room
with
both
of
them
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Finn
,
what
a
beautiful
speech
you
make
.
<EOS>
I
read
every
word
of
it

Violet

<EOS>
"
and
I
do

old
fellow

up

put
his
arm
on

Laura
go
down

hear
it

Violet

I
could
not

I

tie
to
my

You
can
not
conceive
how
dutiful
I
be
during
this
last
month

be
it
to
be
in
a
month

She
say
so
.

She
arrange
everything
,
 
in
concert
with
my
father

<EOS>
when
I
throw
up
the
sponge
,
I
simply
ask
for
a
long
day
.
<EOS>
"
a
long
day
,
my
lord

I
say
.

my

any

him

not

if
I
do
he
would
want
to

me
on
the
coast
of
flander
again

I
do
not

<EOS>
I
have
come

you
both

<EOS>
"
thank
you

Mr.
Finn

Violet

take
his
hand
with
hearty
kindness

<EOS>
"
I
should
not

be
quite
happy
without
one
nice
word
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
try
and
make
the
good
of
it
,
"
say
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
I
say
,
you
will
come
over
and
ride
Bonebreaker
again
.
<EOS>
He
be
down
there
at
the
Bull
,
and
I
have
take
a
little
box
close
by
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
stand
the
governor
's
county
for
hunting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
will
your
wife
go
down
to
Willingford
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
she
will
,
and
ride
to
hound
a
great
deal
closer
than
I
can
ever
do
.
<EOS>
mind
you
come
,
and
if
there
be
anything
in
the
stable
fit
to
carry
you
,
you
shall
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
Phineas
have
to
explain
that
he
have
come
to
bid
them
farewell
,
and
that
it
be
not
at
all
probable
that
he
should
ever
be
able
to
see
Willingford
again
in
the
hunting
season
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
that
I
shall
make
either
of
you
quite
understand
it
,
but
I
have
get
to
begin
again
.
<EOS>
the
chance
be
that
I
shall
never
see
another
foxhound
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
in
Ireland
!
"
exclaim
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
unless
I
should
have
to
examine
one
as
a
witness
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
before
me
but
downright
hard
work
;
and
a
great
deal
of
that
must
be
do
before
I
can
hope
to
earn
a
shilling

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
so
clever
,
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
of

it
will
come
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
be
impatient
about
it
,
nor
yet
unhappy
,

Phineas

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
hunting
will
not
be
much
in
my
line

<EOS>

and
will
you
leave
London
altogether
?
<EOS>
"
Violet
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
Altogether
.
<EOS>
I
shall
stick
to
one
club
,
 
Brooks
's
;
but
I
shall
take
my
name
off
all
the
other

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
deuce
of
a
nuisance
!
"
say
Lord
Chiltern

<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
you
will
be
very
happy
,
"
say
Violet
;

and
you
will
be
a
Lord
Chancellor
in
no
time

you
will
not
go
quite
yet

"
  
"
<EOS>
Next
Sunday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
return
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
here
for
our
wedding
;
 
indeed
you
must
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
marry
unless
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
even
this
,
however
,
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
must
go
on
Sunday
,
and
must
return
no
more
.
<EOS>
then
he
make
his
little
farewell
speech
,
which
he
could
not
deliver
without
some
awkward
stuttering
.
<EOS>
He
would
think
of
her
on
the
day
of
her
marriage
,
and
pray
that
she
may
be
happy
.
<EOS>
and
he
would
send
her
a
little
trifle
before
he
go
,
which
he
hope
she
would
wear
in
remembrance
of
their
old
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
shall
wear
it
,
whatever
it
be
,
or
I
will
know
the
reason
<EOS>
why
,
"
say
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
hold
your
tongue
,
you
rough
bear
!
"
say
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
will
wear
it
.
<EOS>
and
of
course
I
will
think
of
the
giver
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
many
present
,
but
few
that
I
will
think
of
so
much
.
"
<EOS>
then
Phineas
leave
the
room
,
with
his
throat
so
full
that
he
could
not
speak
another
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
still
break
-
hearted
about
you
,
"
say
the
favour
lover
as
soon
as
his
rival
have
leave
the
room

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
that
,
"

Violet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
break
-
hearted
about
everything
.
<EOS>
the
whole
world
be
vanish
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
could
have
make
up
his
mind
to
marry
that
german
woman
with
all
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
understand
,
however
,
that
Phineas
have
never
speak
a
word
to
any
one
as
to
the
offer
which
the
german
woman
have
make
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
morning
of
the
Sunday
on
which
he
be
to
leave
London
that
he
see
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
have
ask
that
it
may
be
so
,
in
order
that
he
may
then
have
nothing
more
upon
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
find
her
quite
alone
,
and
he
could
see
by
her
eye
that
she
have
be
weep
.
<EOS>
as
he
look
at
her
,
remember
that
it
be
not
yet
six
year
since
he
have
first
be
allow
to
enter
that
room
,
he
could
not
but
perceive
how
very
much
she
be
alter
in
appearance
.
<EOS>
then
she
have
be
three
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
have
not
look
to
be
a
day
old
.
<EOS>
now
she
may
have
be
take
to
be
nearly
forty
,
so
much
have
her
trouble
prey
upon
her
spirit
,
and
eat
into
the
vitality
of
her
youth
.
"
<EOS>
so
you
have
come
to
say
good
-
bye
,
"
she
say
,
smile
as
she
rise
to
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Lady
Laura
;
 
to
say
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
not
for
ever
,
I
hope
,
but
probably
for
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
for
ever
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
we
will
not
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
pause
;
but
he
be
silent
,
sit
with
his
hat
dangle
in
his
two
hand
,
and
his
eye
fix
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
continue
,
"
that
sometimes
I
be
very
angry
with
myself
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
must
be
because
you
have
be
too
kind
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
because
I
fear
that
I
have
do
much
to
injure
you
.
<EOS>
from
the
first
day
that
I
know
you
,
 
do
you
remember
,
when
we
be
talk
here
,
in
this
very
room
,
about
the
beginning
of
the
Reform
Bill
;
 
from
that
day
I
wish
that
you
should
come
among
us
and
be
one
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
with
you
,
to
my
infinite
satisfaction
,
 
while
it
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
have
not
last
,
and
now
I
fear
that
it
have
do
you
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
can
say
whether
it
have
be
for
good
or
evil
?
<EOS>
but
of
this
I
be
sure
you
will
be
certain
,
 
that
I
be
very
grateful
to
you
for
all
the
goodness
you
have
show
me
.
"
<EOS>
then
again
he
be
silent
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
what
it
be
that
she
want
,
but
she
do
desire
some
expression
from
his
lip
that
should
be
warm
than
an
expression
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
an
expression
of
love
,
 
of
exist
love
,
 
she
would
have
feel
to
be
an
insult
,
and
would
have
treat
it
as
such
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
know
that
from
him
no
such
insult
could
come
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
in
that
morbid
,
melancholy
state
of
mind
which
require
the
excitement
of
more
than
ordinary
sympathy
,
even
though
that
sympathy
be
all
painful
;
and
I
think
that
she
would
have
be
please
have
he
refer
to
the
passion
for
herself
which
he
have
once
express
.
<EOS>
if
he
would
have
speak
of
his
love
,
and
of
her
mistake
,
and
have
make
some
half
-
suggestion
as
to
what
may
have
be
their
life
have
thing
go
differently
,
 
though
she
would
have
rebuke
him
even
for
that
,
 
still
it
would
have
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
but
at
this
moment
,
though
he
remember
much
that
have
pass
between
them
,
he
be
not
even
think
of
the
Braes
of
Linter
.
<EOS>
all
that
have
take
place
four
year
ago
;
 
and
there
have
be
so
many
other
thing
since
which
have
move
him
even
more
than
that
!
<EOS>
"
You
have
hear
what
I
have
arrange
for
myself
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
at

"
Your
father
have
tell
me
that
you
be
go
to
Dresden
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
 
he
will
accompany
me
,
 
come
home
of
course
for
Parliament
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
break
-
up
,
be
it
not
?
<EOS>
but
the
lawyer
say
that
if
I
remain
here
I
may
be
subject
to
very
disagreeable
attempt
from
Mr.
Kennedy
to
force
me
to
go
back
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
odd
,
be
it
not
,
that
he
should
not
understand
how
impossible
it
be
?
"
  
"
He
mean
to
do
his
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
but
he
become
more
stern
every
day
to
those
who
be
with
him
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
why
should
I
remain
here
?
<EOS>
what
be
there
to
tempt
me
?
<EOS>
as
a
woman
separate
from
her
husband
I
can
not
take
an
interest
in
those
thing
which
use
to
charm
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
be
crush
and
quell
by
my
position
,
even
though
there
be
no
disgrace
in
it
.
"
  
"
no
disgrace
,
certainly
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
nobody
,
 
or
bad
than
nobody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
also
be
go
to
be
a
nobody
,
"
say
Phineas
,
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
you
be
a
man
and
will
get
over
it
,
and
you
have
many
year
before
you
will
begin
to
be
grow
old
.
<EOS>
I
be
grow
old
already
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
feel
it
,
and
know
it
,
and
see
it
.
<EOS>
a
woman
have
a
fine
game
to
play
;
but
then
she
be
so
easily
bowl
out
,
and
the
term
allow
to
her
be
so
short
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
man
's
allowance
of
time
may
be
short
too
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
can
try
his
hand
again
.
<EOS>
"
then
there
be
another
pause
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
,
Mr.
Finn
,
that
you
would
have
marry
,
"
she
say
in
her
very
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
all
my
hope
and
fear
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
you
would
have
marry
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
make
you
think
that
,
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
because
I
see
that
she
like
you
,
and
because
such
a
marriage
would
have
be
so
suitable
.
<EOS>
She
have
all
that
you
want
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
they
say
of
her
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
they
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
offer
to
make
her
his
wife
,
and
that
she
refuse
him
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
that
people
will
not
say
;
 
nothing
on
earth
,
"
say
Phineas
.
<EOS>
then
he
get
up
and
take
his
leave
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
also
want
to
part
from
her
with
some
special
expression
of
affection
,
but
he
do
not
know
how
to
choose
his
word
.
<EOS>
He
have
wish
that
some
allusion
should
be
make
,
not
to
the
Braes
of
Linter
,
but
to
the
close
confidence
which
have
so
long
exist
between
them
;
but
he
find
that
the
language
to
do
this
properly
be
want
to
him
.
<EOS>
have
the
opportunity
arise
he
would
have
tell
her
now
the
whole
story
of
Mary
Flood
Jones
;
but
the
opportunity
do
not
come
,
and
he
leave
her
,
never
have
mention
the
name
of
his
Mary
or
have
hint
at
his
engagement
to
any
one
of
his
friend
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
so
,
"
he
say
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
My
life
in
Ireland
be
to
be
a
new
life
,
and
why
should
I
mix
two
thing
together
that
will
be
so
different
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
to
dine
at
his
lodging
,
and
then
leave
them
for
good
at
eight
o'clock
.
<EOS>
He
have
pack
up
everything
before
he
go
to
Portman
Square
,
and
he
return
home
only
just
in
time
to
sit
down
to
his
solitary
mutton
chop
.
<EOS>
but
as
he
sit
down
he
see
a
small
note
address
to
himself
lie
on
the
table
among
the
crowd
of
book
,
letter
,
and
paper
,
of
which
he
have
still
to
make
disposal
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
small
note
in
an
envelope
of
a
peculiar
tint
of
pink
,
and
he
know
the
handwriting
well
.
<EOS>
the
blood
mount
all
over
his
face
as
he
take
it
up
,
and
he
hesitate
for
a
moment
before
he
open
it
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
that
the
offer
should
be
repeat
to
him
.
<EOS>
slowly
,
hardly
venture
at
first
to
look
at
the
enclosure
,
he
open
it
,
and
the
word
which
it
contain
be
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
I
learn
that
you
be
go
to
-
day
,
and
I
write
a
word
which
you
will
receive
just
as
you
be
depart
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
say
merely
this
,
 
that
when
I
leave
you
the
other
day
I
be
angry
,
not
with
you
,
but
with
myself
.
<EOS>
let
me
wish
you
all
good
wish
and
that
prosperity
which
I
know
you
will
deserve
,
and
which
<EOS>
I
think
you
will
win
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
very
truly
,
  
M.
M.
G.
  
Sunday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Should
he
put
off
his
journey
and
go
to
her
this
very
evening
and
claim
her
as
his
friend
?
<EOS>
the
question
be
ask
and
answer
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
would
not
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
be
he
to
do
<EOS>
so
there
would
be
only
one
possible
word
for
him
to
say
,
and
that
word
should
certainly
never
be
speak
.
<EOS>
but
he
write
to
her
a
reply
,
short
even
than
her
own
short
note
.
  
<EOS>
thank
,
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
but
that
you
and
I
understand
each
other
thoroughly
,
and
that
each
trust
the
other
for
good
wish
and
honest
intention
.
  
<EOS>
always
yours
,
  
<EOS>
P.
F.
  
I
write
these
as
I
be
start
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
write
this
,
he
keep
it
till
the
last
moment
in
his
hand
,
think
that
he
would
not
send
it
.
<EOS>
but
as
he
slip
into
the
cab
,
he
give
the
note
to
his
late
landlady
to
post
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
station
Bunce
come
to
him
to
say
a
word
of
farewell
,
and
Mrs.
Bunce
be
on
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
do
,
Mr.
Finn
,
well
do
,
"
say
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
know
there
be
a
good
drop
in
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
always
tell
me
I
should
ruin
myself
in
Parliament
,
and
so
I
have
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
take
a
deal
to
ruin
a
man
if
he
be
get
the
right
sperrit
.
<EOS>
I
have
well
hope
of
you
now
than
ever
I
have
in
the
old
day
when
you
use
to
be
look
out
for
Government
place
;
 
and
Mr.
Monk
have
try
that
too
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
would
find
the
iron
too
heavy
for
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bunce
with
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
eye
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
one
of
'em
<EOS>
I
ever
have
as
lodger
<EOS>
I
have
care
about
half
as
much
as
I
do
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
then
they
shake
hand
with
him
through
the
window
,
and
the
train
be
off
.
   
<EOS>
conclusion
 
<EOS>
We
be
tell
that
it
be
a
bitter
moment
with
the
Lord
Mayor
when
he
leave
the
Mansion
House
and
become
once
more
Alderman
Jones
,
of
no
.
75
,
Bucklersbury
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chancellors
go
out
of
office
have
a
great
fall
though
they
take
pension
with
them
for
their
consolation
.
<EOS>
and
the
President
of
the
United
States
when
he
leave
the
glory
of
the
White
House
and
once
more
become
a
simple
citizen
<EOS>
must
feel
the
change
severely
.
<EOS>
but
our
hero
,
Phineas
Finn
,
as
he
turn
his
back
upon
the
scene
of
his
many
success
,
and
prepare
himself
for
permanent
residence
in
his
own
country
,
be
,
I
think
,
in
a
bad
plight
than
any
of
the
reduced
divinity
to
whom
I
have
allude
.
<EOS>
They
at
any
rate
have
know
that
their
fall
would
come
.
<EOS>
He
,
like
Icarus
,
have
fly
up
towards
the
sun
,
hope
that
his
wing
of
wax
would
bear
him
steadily
aloft
among
the
god
.
<EOS>
see
that
his
wing
be
wing
of
wax
,
we
must
acknowledge
that
they
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
but
the
celestial
light
have
be
too
strong
for
them
,
and
now
,
have
live
for
five
year
with
lord
and
countess
,
with
Ministers
and
orator
,
with
beautiful
woman
and
man
of
fashion
,
he
must
start
again
in
a
little
lodging
in
Dublin
,
and
hope
that
the
attorney
of
that
litigious
city
may
be
good
to
him
.
<EOS>
on
his
journey
home
he
make
but
one
resolution
.
<EOS>
He
would
make
the
change
,
or
attempt
to
make
it
,
with
manly
strength
.
<EOS>
during
his
last
month
in
London
he
have
allow
himself
to
be
sad
,
depressed
,
and
melancholy
.
<EOS>
there
should
be
an
end
of
all
that
now
.
<EOS>
nobody
at
home
should
see
that
he
be
depressed
.
<EOS>
and
Mary
,
his
own
Mary
,
should
at
any
rate
have
no
cause
to
think
that
her
love
and
his
own
engagement
have
ever
be
the
cause
to
him
of
depression
.
<EOS>
do
he
not
value
her
love
more
than
anything
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
a
thousand
time
he
tell
himself
that
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
there
in
the
old
house
at
Killaloe
to
greet
him
.
<EOS>
Her
engagement
be
an
affair
know
to
all
the
county
,
and
she
have
no
idea
that
it
would
become
her
to
be
coy
in
her
love
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
his
arm
before
he
have
speak
to
his
father
and
mother
,
and
have
make
her
little
speech
to
him
,
 
very
inaudibly
indeed
,
 
while
he
be
cover
her
sweet
face
with
kiss
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Phineas
,
I
be
so
proud
of
you
;
and
I
think
you
be
so
right
,
and
I
be
so
glad
you
have
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
again
he
cover
her
face
with
kiss
.
<EOS>
Could
he
ever
have
have
such
satisfaction
as
this
have
he
allow
Madame
Goesler
's
hand
to
remain
in
his
?
  
<EOS>
on
the
first
night
of
his
arrival
he
sit
for
an
hour
downstairs
with
his
father
talk
over
his
plan
.
<EOS>
He
feel
,
 
he
could
not
but
feel
,
 
that
he
be
not
the
hero
now
that
he
have
be
when
he
be
last
at
Killaloe
,
 
when
he
have
come
thither
with
a
Cabinet
Minister
under
his
wing
.
<EOS>
and
yet
his
father
do
his
good
to
prevent
the
growth
of
any
such
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
old
doctor
be
not
quite
as
well
off
as
he
have
be
when
Phineas
first
start
with
his
high
hope
for
London
.
<EOS>
since
that
day
he
have
abandon
his
profession
and
be
now
live
on
the
fruit
of
his
life
's
labour
.
<EOS>
for
the
last
two
year
he
have
be
absolve
from
the
necessity
of
provide
an
income
for
his
son
,
and
have
probably
allow
himself
to
feel
that
no
such
demand
upon
him
would
again
be
make
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
it
be
necessary
that
he
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
Could
his
son
manage
to
live
on
two
hundred
a
-
year
?
<EOS>
there
would
then
be
four
hundred
a
-
year
leave
for
the
want
of
the
family
at
home
.
<EOS>
Phineas
swear
that
he
could
fight
his
battle
on
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
and
they
end
the
argument
by
split
the
difference
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
pay
exactly
the
same
sum
of
money
for
the
room
he
have
just
leave
in
London
;
but
then
,
while
he
hold
those
room
,
his
income
have
be
two
thousand
a
-
year
.
<EOS>
tenant
-
right
be
a
very
fine
thing
,
but
could
it
be
worth
such
a
fall
as
this
?
  
<EOS>
"
and
about
dear
Mary
?
"
say
the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
may
not
be
very
long
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
speak
to
her
about
it
,
but
your
mother
say
that
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
be
very
averse
to
a
long
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
She
would
not
wish
me
to
marry
her
daughter
with
no
other
income
than
an
allowance
make
by
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
mother
say
that
she
have
some
idea
that
you
and
she
may
live
together
;
 
that
if
they
let
Floodborough
you
may
take
a
small
house
in
Dublin
.
<EOS>
remember
,
Phineas
,
I
be
not
propose
it
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
Phineas
bethink
himself
that
he
be
not
even
yet
so
low
in
the
world
that
he
nee
submit
himself
to
term
dictate
to
him
by
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
that
you
do
not
propose
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
so
,
Phineas
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
should
have
be
oblige
to
oppose
the
plan
even
if
it
have
come
from
you
.
<EOS>
mother
-
in
-
law
be
never
a
comfort
in
a
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
try
it
myself
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
never
will
try
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
that
Mary
do
not
expect
any
such
thing
,
and
that
she
be
willing
to
wait
.
<EOS>
if
I
can
shorten
the
term
of
wait
by
hard
work
,
I
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
the
decision
to
which
Phineas
have
come
on
this
matter
be
probably
make
known
to
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
after
some
mild
fashion
by
old
Mrs.
Finn
.
<EOS>
nothing
more
be
say
to
Phineas
about
a
joint
household
;
but
he
be
quite
able
to
perceive
from
the
manner
of
the
lady
towards
him
that
his
propose
mother
-
in
-
law
wish
him
to
understand
that
he
be
treat
her
daughter
very
badly
.
<EOS>
what
do
it
signify
?
<EOS>
none
of
them
know
the
story
of
Madame
Goesler
,
and
of
course
none
of
them
would
know
it
.
<EOS>
none
of
them
would
ever
hear
how
well
he
have
behave
to
his
little
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mary
do
know
it
all
before
he
leave
her
to
go
up
to
Dublin
.
<EOS>
the
two
lover
allow
themselves
,
 
or
be
allow
by
their
elder
,
one
week
of
exquisite
bliss
together
;
and
during
this
week
,
Phineas
tell
her
,
I
think
,
everything
.
<EOS>
He
tell
her
everything
as
far
as
he
could
do
so
without
seem
to
boast
of
his
own
success
.
<EOS>
how
be
a
man
not
to
tell
such
tale
when
he
have
on
his
arm
,
close
to
him
,
a
girl
who
tell
him
her
little
everything
of
life
,
and
only
ask
for
his
confidence
in
return
?
<EOS>
and
then
his
secret
be
so
precious
to
her
and
so
sacred
,
that
he
feel
as
sure
of
her
fidelity
as
though
she
be
a
very
goddess
of
faith
and
trust
.
<EOS>
and
the
temptation
to
tell
be
so
great
.
<EOS>
for
all
that
he
have
to
tell
she
love
him
the
well
and
still
the
well
.
<EOS>
a
man
desire
to
win
a
virgin
heart
,
and
be
happy
to
know
,
 
or
at
least
to
believe
,
 
that
he
have
win
it
.
<EOS>
with
a
woman
every
former
rival
be
an
add
victim
to
the
wheel
of
the
triumphant
chariot
in
which
she
be
sit
.
<EOS>
"
all
these
have
he
know
and
love
,
cull
sweet
from
each
of
them
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
have
come
to
me
,
and
I
be
the
sweetest
of
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
Mary
be
teach
to
believe
of
Laura
and
of
violet
and
of
Madame
Goesler
,
 
that
though
they
have
have
charm
to
please
,
her
lover
have
never
be
so
charm
as
he
be
now
while
she
be
hang
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
that
she
be
right
in
her
belief
.
<EOS>
during
those
lovely
summer
evening
walk
along
the
shore
of
Lough
Derg
,
Phineas
be
as
happy
as
he
have
ever
be
at
any
moment
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
impatient
,
 
never
,
"
she
say
to
him
on
the
last
evening
.
<EOS>
"
all
I
want
be
that
you
should
write
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
want
more
than
that
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
must
come
down
and
see
me
.
<EOS>
when
you
do
come
they
will
be
happy
,
happy
day
for
me
.
<EOS>
but
of
course
we
can
not
be
marry
for
the
next
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
say
forty
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
anything
that
you
like
;
 
you
will
know
what
I
mean
just
as
well
.
<EOS>
and
,
Phineas
,
I
must
tell
you
one
thing
,
 
though
it
make
me
sad
to
think
of
it
,
and
will
make
me
sad
to
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
have
you
sad
on
our
last
night
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
begin
to
understand
how
much
you
have
give
up
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
give
up
nothing
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
not
be
at
Killaloe
when
Mr.
Monk
be
here
,
and
if
we
have
not
,
 
have
not
,
 
oh
dear
,
if
I
have
not
love
you
so
very
much
,
you
may
have
remain
in
London
,
and
that
lady
would
have
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
never
!
"
say
Phineas
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
she
not
?
<EOS>
She
must
not
be
your
wife
now
,
Phineas
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
pretend
that
I
will
give
you
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
unkind
,
Mary
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
well
;
you
may
say
what
you
please
.
<EOS>
if
that
be
unkind
,
I
be
unkind
.
<EOS>
It
would
kill
me
to
lose
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
have
he
do
right
?
<EOS>
how
could
there
be
a
doubt
about
it
?
<EOS>
how
could
there
be
a
question
about
it
?
<EOS>
which
of
them
have
love
him
,
or
be
capable
of
love
him
as
Mary
love
him
?
<EOS>
what
girl
be
ever
so
sweet
,
so
gracious
,
so
angelic
,
as
his
own
Mary
?
<EOS>
He
swear
to
her
that
he
be
prouder
of
win
her
than
of
anything
he
have
ever
do
in
all
his
life
,
and
that
of
all
the
treasure
that
have
ever
come
in
his
way
<EOS>
she
be
the
most
precious
.
<EOS>
She
go
to
bed
that
night
the
happy
girl
in
all
Connaught
,
although
when
she
part
from
him
she
understand
that
she
be
not
to
see
him
again
till
Christmas
-
Eve
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
do
see
him
again
before
the
summer
be
over
,
and
the
manner
of
their
meeting
be
in
this
wise
.
<EOS>
immediately
after
the
passing
of
that
scramble
Irish
Reform
Bill
,
Parliament
,
as
the
reader
know
,
be
dissolve
.
<EOS>
this
be
in
the
early
day
of
June
,
and
before
the
end
of
July
the
new
member
be
again
assemble
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
this
session
,
late
in
summer
,
be
very
terrible
;
but
it
be
not
very
long
,
and
then
it
be
essentially
necessary
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
of
the
year
's
business
which
must
yet
be
do
,
and
the
country
would
require
to
know
who
be
to
be
the
Ministers
of
the
Government
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
need
that
the
reader
should
be
trouble
any
further
with
the
strategy
of
one
political
leader
or
of
another
,
or
that
more
should
be
say
of
Mr.
Monk
and
his
tenant
-
right
.
<EOS>
the
House
of
Commons
have
offend
Mr.
Gresham
by
vote
in
a
majority
against
him
,
and
Mr.
Gresham
have
punish
the
House
of
Commons
by
subject
it
to
the
expense
and
nuisance
of
a
new
election
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
constitutional
,
and
rational
enough
to
Englishmen
,
though
it
may
be
unintelligible
to
stranger
.
<EOS>
the
upshot
on
the
present
occasion
be
that
the
Ministers
remain
in
their
place
and
that
Mr.
Monk
's
bill
,
though
it
have
receive
the
substantial
honour
of
a
second
reading
,
pass
away
for
the
present
into
the
limbo
of
abortive
legislation
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
would
not
concern
us
at
all
,
nor
our
poor
hero
much
,
be
it
not
that
the
great
man
with
whom
he
have
be
for
two
year
<EOS>
so
pleasant
a
colleague
,
remember
him
with
something
of
affectionate
regret
.
<EOS>
whether
it
begin
with
Mr.
Gresham
or
with
Lord
Cantrip
,
I
will
not
say
;
 
or
whether
Mr.
Monk
,
though
now
a
political
enemy
,
may
have
say
a
word
that
bring
about
the
good
deed
.
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
just
before
the
summer
session
be
bring
to
a
close
Phineas
<EOS>
receive
the
following
letter
from
Lord
Cantrip
:
    
Downing
Street
,
August
4
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
MR
.
<EOS>
FINN
,
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
have
be
talk
to
me
,
and
we
both
think
that
possibly
a
permanent
Government
appointment
may
be
acceptable
to
you
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
doubt
,
that
should
this
be
the
case
,
your
service
would
be
very
valuable
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
vacancy
for
a
poor
-
law
inspector
at
present
in
Ireland
,
whose
residence
I
believe
should
be
in
Cork
.
<EOS>
the
salary
be
a
thousand
a
-
year
.
<EOS>
Should
the
appointment
suit
you
,
Mr.
Gresham
will
be
most
happy
to
nominate
you
to
the
office
.
<EOS>
let
me
have
a
line
at
your
early
convenience
.
  
<EOS>
believe
me
,
  
most
sincerely
yours
,
  
CANTRIP
.
  
<EOS>
He
receive
the
letter
one
morning
in
Dublin
,
and
within
three
hour
he
be
on
his
route
to
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
would
accept
the
appointment
,
but
he
would
not
even
do
that
without
tell
Mary
of
his
new
prospect
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
would
accept
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
though
he
have
be
as
yet
barely
two
month
in
Dublin
,
though
he
have
hardly
be
long
enough
settle
to
his
work
to
have
hope
to
be
able
to
see
in
which
way
there
may
be
a
vista
open
lead
to
success
,
still
he
have
fancy
that
he
have
see
that
success
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
how
to
begin
,
 
and
man
be
afraid
of
him
,
think
that
he
be
unsteady
,
arrogant
,
and
prone
to
failure
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
see
his
way
to
the
possibility
of
a
guinea
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
thousand
a
-
year
!
"
say
Mary
Flood
Jones
,
open
her
eye
wide
with
wonder
at
the
golden
future
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
nothing
very
great
for
a
perpetuity
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Phineas
;
surely
a
thousand
a
-
year
will
be
very
nice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
certain
,
"
say
Phineas
,
"
and
then
we
can
be
marry
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
be
make
up
my
mind
to
wait
ever
so
long
,
"
say
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
your
mind
must
be
unmade
,
"
say
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
nature
of
the
reply
to
Lord
Cantrip
the
reader
may
imagine
,
and
thus
we
will
leave
our
hero
an
Inspector
of
Poor
Houses
in
the
County
of
Cork
.
