introduce
all
the
rest
 
there
once
live
,
in
a
sequestered
part
of
the
county
of
Devonshire
,
one
Mr
Godfrey
Nickleby
:
a
worthy
gentleman
,
who
,
take
it
into
his
head
rather
late
in
life
that
he
must
get
married
,
and
not
be
young
enough
or
rich
enough
to
aspire
to
the
hand
of
a
lady
of
fortune
,
have
wed
an
old
flame
out
of
mere
attachment
,
who
in
her
turn
have
take
him
for
the
same
reason
.
 
<EOS>
thus
two
people
who
can
not
afford
to
play
card
for
money
,
sometimes
sit
down
to
a
quiet
game
for
love
.
   
<EOS>
some
ill
-
condition
person
who
sneer
at
the
life
-
matrimonial
,
may
perhaps
suggest
,
in
this
place
,
that
the
good
couple
would
be
better
liken
to
two
principal
in
a
sparring
match
,
who
,
when
fortune
be
low
and
backer
scarce
,
will
chivalrously
set
to
,
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
the
buffeting
;
and
in
one
respect
indeed
this
comparison
would
hold
good
;
for
,
as
the
adventurous
pair
of
the
Fives
'
Court
will
afterwards
send
round
a
hat
,
and
trust
to
the
bounty
of
the
looker
-
on
for
the
mean
of
regale
themselves
,
so
Mr
Godfrey
Nickleby
and
his
partner
,
the
honeymoon
be
over
,
look
out
wistfully
into
the
world
,
rely
in
no
inconsiderable
degree
upon
chance
for
the
improvement
of
their
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nickleby
's
income
,
at
the
period
of
his
marriage
,
fluctuate
between
sixty
and
eighty
pound
PER
ANNUM
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
people
enough
in
the
world
,
Heaven
know
!
<EOS>
and
even
in
London
(
where
Mr
Nickleby
dwell
in
those
day
)
<EOS>
but
few
complaint
prevail
,
of
the
population
be
scanty
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
extraordinary
how
long
a
man
may
look
among
the
crowd
without
discover
the
face
of
a
friend
,
but
it
be
no
less
true
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nickleby
look
,
and
look
,
till
his
eye
become
sore
as
his
heart
,
but
no
friend
appear
;
and
when
,
grow
tired
of
the
search
,
he
turn
his
eye
homeward
,
he
see
very
little
there
to
relieve
his
weary
vision
.
 
<EOS>
a
painter
who
have
gaze
too
long
upon
some
glare
colour
,
refresh
his
dazzle
sight
by
look
upon
a
dark
and
more
sombre
tint
;
but
everything
that
meet
Mr
Nickleby
's
gaze
wear
so
black
and
gloomy
a
hue
,
that
he
would
have
be
beyond
description
refresh
by
the
very
reverse
of
the
contrast
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
after
five
year
,
when
Mrs
Nickleby
have
present
her
husband
with
a
couple
of
son
,
and
that
embarasse
gentleman
,
impress
with
the
necessity
of
make
some
provision
for
his
family
,
be
seriously
revolve
in
his
mind
a
little
commercial
speculation
of
insure
his
life
next
quarter
-
day
,
and
then
fall
from
the
top
of
the
Monument
by
accident
,
there
come
,
one
morning
,
by
the
general
post
,
a
black
-
bordered
letter
to
inform
him
how
his
uncle
,
Mr
Ralph
Nickleby
,
be
dead
,
and
have
leave
him
the
bulk
of
his
little
property
,
amount
in
all
to
five
thousand
pound
sterling
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
deceased
have
take
no
further
notice
of
his
nephew
in
his
lifetime
,
than
send
to
his
eld
boy
(
who
have
be
christen
after
him
,
on
desperate
speculation
)
a
silver
spoon
in
a
morocco
case
,
which
,
as
he
have
not
too
much
to
eat
with
it
,
seem
a
kind
of
satire
upon
his
have
be
bear
without
that
useful
article
of
plate
in
his
mouth
,
Mr
Godfrey
Nickleby
could
,
at
first
,
scarcely
believe
the
tiding
thus
convey
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
on
examination
,
however
,
they
turn
out
to
be
strictly
correct
.
 
<EOS>
the
amiable
old
gentleman
,
it
seem
,
have
intend
to
leave
the
whole
to
the
Royal
Humane
Society
,
and
have
indeed
execute
a
will
to
that
effect
;
but
the
institution
,
have
be
unfortunate
enough
,
a
few
month
before
,
to
save
the
life
of
a
poor
relation
to
whom
he
pay
a
weekly
allowance
of
three
shilling
and
sixpence
,
he
have
,
in
a
fit
of
very
natural
exasperation
,
revoke
the
bequest
in
a
codicil
,
and
leave
it
all
to
Mr
Godfrey
Nickleby
;
with
a
special
mention
of
his
indignation
,
not
only
against
the
society
for
save
the
poor
relation
's
life
,
but
against
the
poor
relation
also
,
for
allow
himself
to
be
save
.
   
<EOS>
with
a
portion
of
this
property
<EOS>
Mr
Godfrey
Nickleby
purchase
a
small
farm
,
near
Dawlish
in
Devonshire
,
whither
he
retire
with
his
wife
and
two
child
,
to
live
upon
the
good
interest
he
could
get
for
the
rest
of
his
money
,
and
the
little
produce
he
could
raise
from
his
land
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
prosper
so
well
together
that
,
when
he
die
,
some
fifteen
year
after
this
period
,
and
some
five
after
his
wife
,
he
be
enable
to
leave
,
to
his
eld
son
,
Ralph
,
three
thousand
pound
in
cash
,
and
to
his
young
son
,
Nicholas
,
one
thousand
and
the
farm
,
which
be
as
small
a
landed
estate
as
one
would
desire
to
see
.
   
<EOS>
these
two
brother
have
be
bring
up
together
in
a
school
at
Exeter
;
and
,
be
accustom
to
go
home
once
a
week
,
have
often
hear
,
from
their
mother
's
lip
,
long
account
of
their
father
's
suffering
in
his
day
of
poverty
,
and
of
their
deceased
uncle
's
importance
in
his
day
of
affluence
:
which
recital
produce
a
very
different
impression
on
the
two
:
for
,
while
the
young
,
who
be
of
a
timid
and
retire
disposition
,
glean
from
thence
nothing
but
forewarning
to
shun
the
great
world
and
attach
himself
to
the
quiet
routine
of
a
country
life
,
Ralph
,
the
elder
,
deduce
from
the
often
-
repeat
tale
the
two
great
moral
that
rich
be
the
only
true
source
of
happiness
and
power
,
and
that
it
be
lawful
and
just
to
compass
their
acquisition
by
all
mean
short
of
felony
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
"
reason
Ralph
with
himself
,
"
if
no
good
come
of
my
uncle
's
money
when
he
be
alive
,
a
great
deal
of
good
come
of
it
after
he
be
dead
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
my
father
have
get
it
now
,
and
be
save
it
up
for
me
,
which
be
a
highly
virtuous
purpose
;
and
,
go
back
to
the
old
gentleman
,
good
do
come
of
it
to
him
too
,
for
he
have
the
pleasure
of
thinking
of
it
<EOS>
all
his
life
long
,
and
of
be
envy
and
court
by
all
his
family
besides
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
Ralph
always
wind
up
these
mental
soliloquy
by
arrive
at
the
conclusion
,
that
there
be
nothing
like
money
.
   
<EOS>
not
confine
himself
to
theory
,
or
permit
his
faculty
to
rust
,
even
at
that
early
age
,
in
mere
abstract
speculation
,
<EOS>
this
promise
lad
commence
usurer
on
a
limited
scale
at
school
;
put
out
at
good
interest
a
small
capital
of
slate
-
pencil
and
marble
,
and
gradually
extend
his
operation
until
they
aspire
to
the
copper
coinage
of
this
realm
,
in
which
he
speculate
to
considerable
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
he
trouble
his
borrower
with
abstract
calculation
of
figure
,
or
reference
to
ready
-
reckoner
;
his
simple
rule
of
interest
be
all
comprise
in
the
one
golden
sentence
,
"
two
-
pence
for
every
half
-
penny
,
"
which
greatly
simplify
the
account
,
and
which
,
as
a
familiar
precept
,
more
easily
acquire
and
retain
in
the
memory
than
any
know
rule
of
arithmetic
,
can
not
be
too
strongly
recommend
to
the
notice
of
capitalist
,
both
large
and
small
,
and
more
especially
of
money
-
broker
and
bill
-
discounter
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
do
these
gentleman
justice
,
many
of
them
be
to
this
day
in
the
frequent
habit
of
adopt
it
,
with
eminent
success
.
   
<EOS>
in
like
manner
,
do
young
Ralph
Nickleby
avoid
all
those
minute
and
intricate
calculation
of
odd
day
,
which
nobody
who
have
work
sum
in
simple
-
interest
can
fail
to
have
find
most
embarrassing
,
by
establish
the
one
general
rule
that
all
sum
of
principal
and
interest
should
be
pay
on
pocket
-
money
day
,
that
be
to
say
,
on
Saturday
:
and
that
whether
a
loan
be
contract
on
the
Monday
,
or
on
the
Friday
,
the
amount
of
interest
should
be
,
in
both
case
,
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
argue
,
and
with
great
show
of
reason
,
that
it
ought
to
be
rather
more
for
one
day
than
for
five
,
inasmuch
as
the
borrower
may
in
the
former
case
be
very
fairly
presume
to
be
in
great
extremity
,
otherwise
he
would
not
borrow
at
all
with
such
odd
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
fact
be
interesting
,
as
illustrate
the
secret
connection
and
sympathy
which
always
exist
between
great
mind
.
<EOS>
though
Master
Ralph
Nickleby
be
not
at
that
time
aware
of
it
,
the
class
of
gentleman
before
allude
to
,
proceed
on
just
the
same
principle
in
all
their
transaction
.
   
<EOS>
from
what
we
have
say
of
this
young
gentleman
,
and
the
natural
admiration
the
reader
will
immediately
conceive
of
his
character
,
it
may
perhaps
be
infer
that
he
be
to
be
the
hero
of
the
work
which
we
shall
presently
begin
.
 
<EOS>
to
set
this
point
at
rest
,
for
once
and
for
ever
,
we
hasten
to
undeceive
them
,
and
stride
to
its
commencement
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
death
of
his
father
,
Ralph
Nickleby
,
who
have
be
some
time
before
place
in
a
mercantile
house
in
London
,
apply
himself
passionately
to
his
old
pursuit
of
money
-
get
,
in
which
he
speedily
become
so
bury
and
absorb
,
that
he
quite
forget
his
brother
for
many
year
;
and
if
,
at
time
,
a
recollection
of
his
old
playfellow
break
upon
him
through
the
haze
in
which
he
live
---
for
gold
conjure
up
a
mist
about
a
man
,
more
destructive
of
all
his
old
sense
and
lulling
to
his
feeling
than
the
fume
of
charcoal
---
it
bring
along
with
it
<EOS>
a
companion
think
,
that
if
they
be
intimate
he
would
want
to
borrow
money
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
Mr
Ralph
Nickleby
shrug
his
shoulder
,
and
say
thing
be
well
as
they
be
.
   
<EOS>
as
for
Nicholas
,
he
live
a
single
man
on
the
patrimonial
estate
until
he
grow
tired
of
live
alone
,
and
then
he
take
to
wife
the
daughter
of
a

with
a
dower
of
one
thousand

about
him

by
this

so
much

take
at

to

Mr

shake

They

this
fit
of
wander
past

he
solemnly
commend
them
to
one
who
never
desert
the
widow

her
fatherless
child

,
smile
gently
on
them

turn
upon

<EOS>
Mr
Ralph
Nickleby
be
not
,
strictly
speak
,
what
you
would
call
a
merchant
,
neither
be
he
a
banker
,
nor
an
attorney
,
nor
a
special
pleader
,
nor
a
notary
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
not
a
tradesman
,
and
still
less
could
he
lay
any
claim
to
the
title
of
a
professional
gentleman
;
for
it
would
have
be
impossible
to

any
recognise
profession

"
Office

"
it
be
clear
that
Mr
Ralph
Nickleby
do
,
or
pretend
to
do
,
business
of
some
kind
;
and
the
fact
,
if
it
require
any
further
circumstantial
evidence
,
be
abundantly
demonstrate
by
the
diurnal
attendance
,
between
the
hour
of
half
-
past
nine
and
five
,
of
a
sallow

faced
man
in
rusty

who
sit
upon
an
uncommonly
hard
stool
in
a
species
of

pantry
at
the
end
of

and
always

<EOS>
although
a

member
of
the
graver
profession

about
Golden
Square

it

not

It

<EOS>
this
would
not

very
well
adapt
to

but
Mr

have
live
there

for
many
year

utter
no

score

He
know
nobody

about
,
and
nobody
know
him
,
although
he
enjoy
the
reputation
of
be
immensely
rich
.
 
<EOS>
the
tradesman
hold
that
he
be
a
sort
of
lawyer
,
and
the
other
neighbour
opine
that
he
be
a
kind
of
general
agent
;
both
of
which
guess
be
as
correct
and
definite
as
guess
about
other
people

<EOS>
Mr
Ralph
Nickleby
sit
in
his
private
office
one
morning
,
ready
dressed
to
walk
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
a
bottle
-
green
spencer
over
a
blue
coat
;
a
white
waistcoat
,
grey
mixture
pantaloon
,
and
Wellington
boot
draw
over
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
corner
of
a
small
-
plaited
shirt
-
frill
struggle
out
,
as
if
insist
to
show
itself
,
from
between
his
chin
and
the
top
button
of
his
spencer
;
and
the
latter
garment
be
not
make
low
enough
to
conceal
a
long
gold
watch
-
chain
,
compose
of
a
series
of
plain
ring
,
which
have
its
beginning
at
the
handle
of
a
gold
repeater
in
Mr
Nickleby
's
pocket
,
and
its
termination
in
two
little
key
:
one
belong
to
the
watch
itself
,
and
the
other
to
some
patent
padlock
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
a
sprinkling
of
powder
upon
his
head
,
as
if
to
make
himself
look
benevolent
;
but
if
that
be
his
purpose
,
he
would
perhaps
have
do
better
to
powder
his
countenance
also
,
for
there
be
something
in
its
very
wrinkle
,
and
in
his
cold
restless
eye
,
which
seem
to
tell
of
cunne
that
would
announce
itself
in
spite
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
however
this
may
be
,
there
he
be
;
and
as
he
be
all
alone
,
neither
the
powder
,
nor
the
wrinkle
,
nor
the
eye
,
have
the
small
effect
,
good
or
bad
,
upon
anybody
just
then
,
and
be
consequently
no
business
of
ours
just
now

Mr

account

desk
,
and
,
throw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
gaze
with
an
air
of
abstraction
through
the
dirty
window
.
 
<EOS>
some
London
house
have
a
melancholy
little
plot
of
ground
behind
them
,
usually
fence
in
by
four
high
whitewash
wall
,
and
frown
upon
by
stack
of
chimney
:
in
which
there
wither
on
,
from
year
to

,
a
crippled
tree
,
that
make
a
show
of
put
forth
a
few
leave
late
in
autumn
when
other
tree
shed
theirs
,
and
,
droop
in
the
effort
,
linger
on
,
all
crackle
and
smoke
-
dry
,
till
the
follow
season
,
when
it
repeat
the
same
process
,
and
perhaps
,
if
the
weather
be
particularly
genial
,
even
tempt
some
rheumatic
sparrow
to
chirrup
in
its
branch
.
 
<EOS>
People
sometimes
call
these
dark
yard
"
garden
"
;
it
be
not
suppose
that
they
be
ever
plant
,
but
rather
that
they
be
piece
of
unreclaimed
land
,
with
the
withered
vegetation
of
the
original
brick
-
field
.
 
<EOS>
no
man
think
of
walk
in
this
desolate
place
,
or
of
turn
it
to
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
hamper
,
half
-
a

dozen
break
bottle

and
such
-
like
rubbish
,
may
be
throw
there
,
when
the
tenant
first
move
in
,
but
nothing
more
;
and
there
they
remain
until
he
go
away
again
:
<EOS>
the
damp
straw
take
just
as
long
to
moulder
as
it
think
proper
:
and
mingle
with
the
scanty
box
,
and
stunt
everbrown
,
and
break
flower

pot
,
that
be
scatter
mournfully
about

a
prey
to
"

and
dirt
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
into
a
place
of
this
kind
that
Mr
Ralph
Nickleby
gaze
,
as
he
sit
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
look
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
fix
his
eye
upon
a
distort

tree
,
plant
by
some
former
tenant
in
a
tub
that
have
once
be
green
,
and
leave
there
,
year
before
,
to
rot
away
piecemeal
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
very
inviting
in
the
object
,
but
Mr
Nickleby
be
wrapt
in
a
brown
study
,
and
sit
contemplate
it
with
far
great
attention
than
,
in
a
more
conscious
mood
,
he
would
have
deign
to
bestow
upon
the
rare
exotic
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
his
eye
wander
to
a
little
dirty
window
on
the
left
,
through
which
the
face
of
the
clerk
be
dimly
visible
;
that
worthy
chancing
to
look
up
,
he
beckon
him
to
attend
.
   
<EOS>
in
obedience
to
this
summon
the
clerk
get
off
the
high
stool
(
to
which
he
have
communicate
a
high
polish
by
countless
getting
off

He

Noggs
give
a
peculiar
grunt
,
as
be
his
custom
at
the
end
of
all
dispute
with
his
master
,
to
imply
that
he

Noggs
)
triumph
;
and
(
as
he
rarely
speak
to
anybody
unless
somebody
speak
to
him
)
fall
into
a
grim
silence
,
and
rub
his
hand
slowly
over
each
other
:
crack
the
joint
of
his
finger
,
and
squeeze
them
into
all
possible
distortion
.
 
<EOS>
the
incessant
performance
of
this
routine
on
every
occasion
,
and
the
communication
of
a
fix
and
rigid
look
to
his
unaffected
eye
,
so
as
to
make
it
uniform
with
the
other
,
and
to
render
it
impossible
for
anybody
to
determine
where
or
at
what
he
be
look
,
be
two
among
the
numerous
peculiarity
of
Mr

the

that
it
consider
the
Muffin
Boys
,
as
at

constituted
,
wholly
underserve
the
confidence
of
the
public
;
and
that
it
deem
the
whole
Muffin
system
alike
prejudicial
to
the
health
and
moral
of
the
people
,
and
subversive
of
the
good
interest
of

commercial
and
mercantile

<EOS>
the
honourable

speech

lively
emotion
in
every
individual
present
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
visit
the
house
of
the
poor
in
the
various
district
of
London
,
and
have
find
them
destitute
of
the
slight
vestige
of
a
muffin
,
which
there
appear
too
much
reason
to
believe
some
of
these
indigent
person
do
not
taste
from
year
's
end
to
year
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
find
that
among
muffin
-
seller
there
exist
drunkenness
,
debauchery
,
and
profligacy
,
which
he
attribute
to
the
debase
nature
of
their
employment
as
at
present
exercise
;
he
have
find
the
same
vice
among
the
poor
class
of
people
who
ought
to
be
muffin
consumer
;
and
this
he
attribute
to
the
despair
engender
by
their
be
place
beyond
the
reach
of
that
nutritious
article
,
which
drive
them
to
seek
a
false
stimulant
in
intoxicate
liquor

<EOS>
He
would
undertake
to
prove
before
a
committee
of
the
House
of

,
that
there
exist
a
combination
to
keep
up
the
price
of
muffin
,
and
to
give
the
bellman
a
monopoly
;
he
would
prove
it
by
bellman
at
the
bar
of
that
House
;
and
he
would
also
prove
,
that
these
man
correspond
with
each
other
by
secret
word
and
sign
as
"
Snooks

"
"
Walker

Ferguson

and
many
other

<EOS>
It
be
this
melancholy
state
of
thing

propose
to
correct
;
firstly

it
be

it
be
the
supporter
of
this
bill
who
would
confer
undying
brightness

under
the
name
of

<EOS>
this
word
be
much
use

reproach

elderly
gentleman

probably
with

deluding

this
appeal
set
the

upon
think

she
may
have
make
a
more
successful
venture

her
one
thousand

then
she
begin
to
reflect
what
a
comfortable
sum

it
would
have
be
just
then
;
which
dismal
thought
make
her
tear
flow
faster

in
the
excess

these
grief
she
(
be
a
well

mean
woman
enough

weak
withal

fall
first
to
deplore
her
hard
fate
,
and
then
to
remark
,
with
many
sobs
,
that
to
be
sure
she
have
be
a
slave
to
poor
Nicholas
,
and
have
often
tell
him
she
may
have
marry
better
(
as
indeed
<EOS>
she
have
,
very
often
)
,
and
that
she
never
know
in
his
lifetime
how
the
money
go
,
but
that
if
he
have
confide
in
her
they
may
all
have
be
well
off
that
day
;
with
other
bitter
recollection
common
to
most
married
lady

either
during
their
coverture

afterwards

at
both
period

Mrs

conclude
by
lament
that
the

never
deign
to
profit
by
her
advice

save
on
one
occasion

which
be
a
strictly
veracious
statement

Your

It
be
very
little
that
Nicholas
know
of

he
guess
enough
about
its
way
to
think

that
if
he

Miss

one
little
kiss
,
perhaps
she
may
not
be
the
less
kindly
disposed

so

he
give

three

four
with
a
kind
of
jocose
gallantry

Miss

evince
no
great
symptom
of
displeasure

declare
,
as
she
adjust
her
yellow
turban

never

it

satisfactory

Nicholas

by
the
time
he
have
find
a
man

only
seven
o'clock

so
he
walk
slowly
on

a
little

advance
of
the

very
probably
with
not
half
as
light
a

fold
his

well
as

solemn
silence
,
look
carelessly
at
the
familiar
object
which
meet
his
eye
on
every
side
as
the
coach
roll
on
;
the
only
thing
he
seem
to
care
for
,
be
horse
and
drove
of
cattle
,
which
he
scrutinise
with
a
critical
air
as
they
be
pass
upon
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
the

intensely
and
bitterly
cold

back
from
such
excursion
with
a
very
red
nose
,
and
compose
himself
to
sleep
directly
,
there
be
reason
to
suppose
that
he
derive
great
benefit
from
the
process

<EOS>
the
night

<EOS>
there

it

They

by

off
all
effaceable
mark
of

,
the

<EOS>
the
BARON
of
GROGZWIG
   
<EOS>
"
the
Baron
Von
Koeldwethout
,
of
Grogzwig
in
Germany
,
be
as
likely
a
young
baron
as
you
would
wish
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
say
that
he
live
in
a
castle
,
because
that
be
of
course
;
neither
need
<EOS>
I
say
that
he
live
in
an
old
castle
;
for
what
german
baron
ever
live
in
a
new
one
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
strange
circumstance
connect
with
this
venerable
building
,
among
which
,
not
the
least
startling
and
mysterious
be
,
that
when
the
wind
blow
,
it
rumble
in
the
chimney
,
or
even
howl
among
the
tree
in
the
neighbour
forest
;
and
that
when
the
moon
shone
,
she
find
her
way
through
certain
small
loophole
in
the
wall
,
and
actually
make
some
part
of
the
wide
hall
and
gallery
quite
light
,
while
she
leave
other
in
gloomy
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
one
of
the
baron
's
ancestor
,
be
short
of
money
,
have
insert
a
dagger
in
a
gentleman
who
call
one
night
to
ask
his
way
,
and
it
be
suppose
that
these
miraculous
occurrence
take
place
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
hardly
know
how
that
could
have
be
,
either
,
because
the
baron
's
ancestor
,
who
be
an
amiable
man
,
feel
very
sorry
afterwards
for
have
be
so
rash
,
and
lay
violent
hand
upon
a
quantity
of
stone
and
timber
which
belong
to
a
weak
baron
,
build
a
chapel
as
an
apology
,
and
so
take
a
receipt
from
Heaven
,
in
full
of
all
demand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
talk
of
the
baron
's
ancestor
put
me
in
mind
of
the
baron
's
great
claim
to
respect
,
on
the
score
of
his
pedigree
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
to
say
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
how
many
ancestor
the
baron
have
;
but
I
know
that
he
have
a
great
many
more
than
any
other
man
of
his
time
;
and
I
only
wish
that
he
have
live
in
these
latter
day
,
that
he
may
have
have
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
hard
thing
upon
the
great
man
of
past
century
,
that
they
should
have
come
into
the
world
so
soon
,
because
a
man
who
be
bear
three
or
four
hundred
year
ago
,
can
not
reasonably
be
expect
to
have
have
as
many
relation
before
him
,
as
a
man
who
be
bear
now
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
man
,
whoever
he
be
---
and
he
may
be
a
cobbler
or
some
low
vulgar
dog
for
aught
we
know
---
will
have
a
long
pedigree
than
the
great
nobleman
now
alive
;
and
I
contend
that
this
be
not
fair
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
the
Baron
Von
Koeldwethout
of
Grogzwig
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
fine
swarthy
fellow
,
with
dark
hair
and
large
moustachio
,
who
ride
a
-
hunting
in
clothe
of
Lincoln
green
,
with
russet
boot
on
his
foot
,
and
a
bugle
slung
over
his
shoulder
like
the
guard
of
a
long
stage
.
<EOS>
when
he
blow
this
bugle

twenty

inferior
rank

coarser

a
little
thick

turn
out
directly

away
gallop

whole

with
spear
in
their
hand
like
lacquered
area

to
hunt
down
the
boar

perhaps
encounter
a

him
first

his
whisker
with
him
afterwards

this
be
a
merry
life
for
the
Baron
of
Grogzwig

a
merrier
still

the
pleasure

nothing

that

like

use
to
have
;

that

he
be
as
fierce
as
a
lion
,

as
bold
as
brass

he
be
decidedly
snub
and
put
down

by

this

whole
extent

misfortune

about
a
year
after
his
nuptial
,
there
come
into
the
world
a
lusty
young
baron
,
in
whose
honour
a
great
many
firework
be
let
off
,
and
a
great
many
dozen
of
wine
drunk

next
year
there
come
a
young
baroness
,

next
year
another
young
baron
,

so
on
,
every
year
,
either
a
baron
or
baroness
(
and
one
year
both
together

,
until
the

find
himself
the
father
of
a
small
family
of
twelve

<EOS>
upon
every
one
of
these
anniversary
,
the
venerable
Baroness
Von
Swillenhausen
be
nervously
sensitive
for
the
well
-
being
of
her
child
the
Baroness
Von
Koeldwethout
;
and
although
it
be
not
find
that
the
good
lady
ever
do
anything
material
towards
contribute
to
her
child
's
recovery
,
still
she
make
it
a
point
of
duty
to
be
as
nervous
as
possible
at
the
castle
of
Grogzwig
,
and
to
divide
her
time
between
moral
observation
on
the
baron

housekeeping
,

bewail
the
hard
lot
of
her
unhappy
daughter

<EOS>
and
if
the
Baron
of

,
a
little
hurt
and
irritated
at
this
,
take
heart
,

venture
to
suggest
that
his
wife
be
at

no
bad
off
than
the
wife

the

beg

remark

to
be
sure
she
do
cry
a
great
deal
more
than

be

hearted
brute
alive

it
be

Baron
of
Grogzwig

the
poor

bore
it
all

long
as
he
could

it
no

lose

apply
a

if

still
feel
tempt
to
retire

that
they
smoke
a

ever
so
anxious

alarming
colour

and
as
the
lady

humour

consider
to

in
retort
,
Mr
Squeers
laugh
heartily
,
and
seem
to
expect
that
Nicholas
should
do
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
after
some
further
conversation
between
the
master
and
mistress
relative
to
the
success
of
Mr
Squeers
's
trip
and
the
people
who

young
servant
girl

Yorkshire
pie
and
some
cold
beef

coat
pocket

different
boy

other
small
document

which
he

down
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
glance
,
with
an
anxious
and
timid
expression
,
at
the
paper
,
as
if
with
a
sickly
hope
that
one
among
them
may
relate
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
look
be
a
very
painful
one
,
and
go
to
Nicholas
's
heart
at
once
;
for
it
tell
a
long
and
very
sad
history
.
   
<EOS>
It
induce
him
to
consider
the
boy
more
attentively
,
and
he
be
surprised
to
observe
the
extraordinary
mixture
of
garment
which
form
his
dress
.
 
<EOS>
although
he
could
not
have
be
less
than
eighteen
or
nineteen
year
old

be
tall
for
that
age

he
wear
a
skeleton
suit

such
as
be
usually
put
upon
very
little
boy
,
and
which
,
though
most
absurdly
short
in
the
arm
and
leg
,
be
quite
wide
enough
for
his
attenuate
frame
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
that
the
low
part
of
his
leg
may
be
in
perfect
keeping
with
this
singular
dress
,
he
have
a
very
large
pair
of
boot
,
originally
make
for
top
,
which
may
have
be
once
wear
by
some
stout
farmer
,
but
be
now
too
patch
and
tattere
for
a
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
know
how
long
he
have
be
there
,
but
he
still
wear
the
same
linen
which
he
have
first
take
down
;
for
,
round
his
neck
,
be
a
tattere
child
's
frill
,
only
half
conceal
by
a
coarse
,
man
's
neckerchief

<EOS>
He
be
lame
;
and
as
he
feign
to
be
busy
in
arrange
the
table
,
glance
at
the
letter
with
a
look
so
keen
,
and
yet
so
dispirited
and
hopeless
,
that
Nicholas
could
hardly
bear
to
watch
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
bother
about
there
,
Smike

the
nervous
wandering
of
his
finger

towards

<EOS>
It

one

hand
to
his
head

an
effort
to
recollect
something
,
and
then
,
look
vacantly
at
his
questioner

gradually
break
into
a
smile

limp
away

Mrs

as

all
that
Nicholas
could
distinguish
be
,
that
Mr

say
what
Mrs

have
say
,
be
injudicious
,
and
that
Mrs

say
what

<EOS>
a

Smike

push
by

,
and
box
by
Mr

which
course
of
treatment
brighten
his
intellect

enable
him
to
suggest
that
possibly
Mrs
Squeers
may
have
the
spoon
in
her
pocket
,
as
indeed
turn
out
to
be
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
as
Mrs

have
previously
protest
,
however
,
that
she
be
quite
certain
<EOS>
she
have
not
get
it

Smike
receive

<EOS>
Nicholas
sigh
involuntarily
at
the
thought
of
the
agreeable
domestic
prospect
thus
open
to
him
;
but
Squeers
be
,
fortunately
,
too
much
occupy
with
his
own
reflection
to
perceive
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
way

continue

she
be
more
than

ten

more

do
thing

Nickleby

half
the

would
do

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
they
would
not
,
sir

"
answer
Nicholas
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
the
fact
be
,
that
both
Mr
and
Mrs
Squeers
view
the
boy
in
the
light
of
their
proper
and
natural
enemy
;
or
,
in
other
word
,
they
hold
and
consider
that
their
business
and
profession
be
to
get
as
much
from
every
boy
as
could
by
possibility
be
screw
out
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
point
they
be
both
agree
,
and
behave
in
unison
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
difference
between
them
be
,
that
Mrs
Squeers
wage
war
against
the
enemy
openly
and
fearlessly
,
and
that
Squeers
cover
his
rascality
,
even
at
home
,
with
a
spice
of
his
habitual
deceit
;
as
if
he
really
have
a
notion
of
someday
or
other
be
able
to
take
himself
in
,
and
persuade
his
own
mind
that
he
be
a
very
good
fellow
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
come
,
"
say
Squeers
,
interrupt
the
progress
of
some
thought
to
this
effect
in
the
mind
of
his
usher
,
"
let
's
go
to
the
schoolroom
;
and
lend
me
a
hand
with

<EOS>
Nicholas
assist
his
master
to
put
on
an
old
fustian

,
which
he
take
down
from

It

because

state
of
feeling

but
when
he
recollect
that
,
be
there
as
an
assistant
,
he
actually
seem
---
no
matter
what
unhappy
train
of
circumstance
have
bring
him
to
that
pass
---
to
be
the
aider
and
abettor
of
a
system
which
fill
him
with
honest
disgust
and
indignation
,
he
loathe
himself
,
and
feel
,
for
the
moment
,
as
though
the
mere
consciousness
of
his
present
situation
must
,
through
all
time
to
come
,
prevent
his
raise
his
head
again
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
for
the
present
,
his
resolve
be
take
,
and
the
resolution
he
have
form
on
the
precede
night
remain
undisturbed
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
write
to
his
mother
and
sister
,
announce
the
safe
conclusion
of
his
journey
,
and
say
as
little
about
Dotheboys
Hall
,
and
say
that
little
as
cheerfully
,
as
he
possibly
could
.
 
<EOS>
He
hope
that
by
remain
where
he
be
,
he
may
do
some
good
,
even
there
;
at

event
,
other

too
much
on
his
uncle

favour

to
admit
of
his
awaken
his
wrath
just

one
reflection

him
far
more
than
any
selfish

out
of

<EOS>
this
be
the
probable
destination
of
his
sister
Kate

<EOS>
His
uncle
have
deceive
him
,
and
may
he
not
consign
her
to
some
miserable
place
where
her
youth
and
beauty
would
prove
a
far
great
curse
than
ugliness
and
decrepitude
?
 
<EOS>
to
a
caged
man
,
bind

this
be
a
terrible
idea

<EOS>
no

he

<EOS>
have
pretty
good
reason
,
by

to

no
great
difficulty
in

at
this
conclusion
,
and
try
to
persuade
himself
that
the

no
farther
than
between

<EOS>
as
he

<EOS>
if

he

my
opinion

<EOS>
"
Mrs

intend
to
say
"
foundle

but
,
as
she
frequently
remark
when
she
make
any
such
mistake
,
it
would
be
all
the
same
a
hundred
year
hence
;
with
which
axiom
of
philosophy
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
she
be
in
the
constant
habit
of
console
the
boy
when
they
labour
under
more
than
ordinary
ill
-
usage

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
nothing

Squeers

in
answer

for

<EOS>
if

it

we

I

vehemently

return
Squeers
,
"
I
do
not

I
do

<EOS>
Mrs

chuckle
vastly
on
the
receipt
of
these
flattering

and
say
,
she
hope
she
have
tame
a
high
spirit
or
two
in

<EOS>
It
be

due

<EOS>
Miss
Fanny

carefully
treasure
up
this
,

much
more

when
she
question
the

the
outward

to

with
so
many
laudatory

his

that
Miss

be
not

at
the
conclusion
that
the
new
usher
must
be
a
very
remarkable
person
,
or
,
as
she
herself
significantly
phrase
it
,
"
something
quite
out
of

"
 
<EOS>
and
so
Miss

make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
take
a
personal
observation
of
Nicholas
the
very
next
day

<EOS>
in

of
this
design

the
young

the
opportunity

and
go
accidentally
into
the
schoolroom
to
get
a
pen

:
where
,
see
nobody

Nicholas
preside
over
the
boy

she
blush
very
deeply
,
and
exhibit
great
confusion

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
Mr

out

say
Nicholas
,
by
no

overcome
by
the
apparition
,
unexpected
though
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
know

ask
Miss

with
bashful
hesitation

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
say
about
an
hour

reply
Nicholas
---
politely
of
course
,
but
without
any
indication
of
be
stricken
to
the
heart
by
Miss

charm

<EOS>
"
I

very

murmur
Miss
Squeers
,
blush
once
more
,
and
glance
,
from
the
pen
in
her
hand
,
to
Nicholas
at
his
desk
,
and
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
all
you

"
say
Nicholas

point
to
the
pen

and
smile
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
at
the
affected
embarrassment
of
the
schoolmaster

"
perhaps
I
can
supply
his
place

<EOS>
Miss
Squeers
glance
at
the
door
,
as
if
dubious
of
the
propriety
of
advance
any
nearer
to
an
utter
stranger
;
then
round
the
schoolroom
,
as
though
in
some
measure
reassure
by
the
presence
of
forty
boy
;
and
finally
sidle
up
to
Nicholas
and
deliver
the
pen
into
his
hand
,
with
a
most
win
mixture
of
reserve
and
condescension
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
it
be
a
hard
or
a
soft
nib

"
<EOS>
inquire
Nicholas
,
smile
to
prevent
himself
from
laugh
outright

<EOS>
"
He
have
a
beautiful

Miss

<EOS>
with
which
word

Miss

<EOS>
It
may
be
,
to
give
Nicholas
to
understand

upon

<EOS>
to
account
for

Miss

a
vast
number
of
thing
Nicholas
have
not

which
be
all
so
very
complimentary
as

conclusive

the
fearful
hardship

mother
<EOS>
strenuously
oppose

on

this

and
a
banker
's
book
;
all
of
which
image
succeed
each
other
with
such
rapidity
,
that
he
have
no
sooner
finish
speak
,
than
she
nod
her
head
and
say
"
very
true
,
"
with
great
appearance
of
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
your
uncle
say
be
very
true
,
Kate
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
when
your
poor
papa
<EOS>
and
I
come
to
town
after
we
be
marry
,
that
a
young
lady
bring
me
home
a
chip
cottage
-
bonnet
,
with
white
and
green
trimming
,
and
green
persian
lining
,
in
her
own
carriage
,
which
drive
up
to
the
door
full
gallop
;
---
at
least
,
I
be
not
quite
certain
whether
it
be
her
own
carriage
or
a
hackney
chariot
,
but
I
remember
very
well
that
the
horse
drop
down
dead
as
he
be
turn
round
,
and
that
your
poor
papa
say
he
have
not
have
any
corn
for
a
fortnight
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
anecdote
,
so
strikingly
illustrative
of
the
opulence
of
milliner
,
be
not
receive
with
any
great
demonstration
of
feeling
,
inasmuch
as
Kate
hang
down
her
head
while
it
be
relate
,
and
Ralph
manifest
very
intelligible
symptom
of
extreme
impatience
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
lady
's
name
,
"
say
Ralph
,
hastily
strike
in
,
"
be
Mantalini
---
Madame
Mantalini
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
live
near
Cavendish
Square
.
 
<EOS>
if
your
daughter
be
dispose
to
try
after
the
situation
,
I
will
take
her
there
directly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
your
uncle
,
my
love
?
"
inquire
Mrs
Nickleby
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
great
deal
,
"
reply
Kate
;
"
but
not
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
speak
to
him
when
we
be
alone
;
---
it
will
save
his
time
if
I
thank
him
and
say
what
I
wish
to
say
to
him
,
as
we
walk
along
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
these
word
,
Kate
hurry
away
,
to
hide
the
trace
of
emotion
that
be
steal
down
her
face
,
and
to
prepare
herself
for
the
walk
,
while
Mrs
Nickleby
amuse
her
brother
-
in
-
law
by
give
him
,
with
many
tear
,
a
detailed
account
of
the
dimension
of
a
rosewood
cabinet
piano
they
have
possess
in
their
day
of
affluence
,
together
with
a
minute
description
of
eight
drawing
-
room
chair
,
with
turn
leg
and
green
chintz
squab
to
match
the
curtain
,
which
have
cost
two
pound
fifteen
shilling
apiece
,
and
have
go
at
the
sale
for
a
mere
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
these
reminiscence
be
at
length
cut
short
by
Kate
's
return
in
her
walking
dress
,
when
Ralph
,
who
have
be
fret
and
fuming
during
the
whole
time
of
her
absence
,
lose
no
time
,
and
use
very
little
ceremony
,
in
descend
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
he
say
,
take
her
arm
,
"
walk
as
fast
as
you
can
,
and
you
will
get
into
the
step
that
you
will
have
to
walk
to
business
with
,
every
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
lead
Kate
off
,
at
a
good
round
pace
,
towards
Cavendish
Square
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
,
uncle
,
"
say
the
young
lady
,
after
they
have
hurry
on
in
silence
for
some
time
;
"
very
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
say
Ralph
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
do
your
duty
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
please
,
uncle
,
"
reply
Kate
:
"
indeed
I
---
"
   
"
do
not
begin
to
cry
,
"
growl
Ralph
;
"
I
hate
cry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
foolish
,
I
know
,
uncle
,
"
begin
poor
Kate
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
"
reply
Ralph
,
stop
her
short
,
"
and
very
affected
besides
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
no
more
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
perhaps
this
be
not
the
good
way
to
dry
the
tear
of
a
young
and
sensitive
female
,
about
to
make
her
first
entry
on
an
entirely
new
scene
of
life
,
among
cold
and
uninterested
stranger
;
but
it
have
its
effect
notwithstanding
.
 
<EOS>
Kate
colour
deeply
,
breathe
quickly
for
a
few
moment
,
and
then
walk
on
with
a
firm
and
more
determined
step
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
curious
contrast
to
see
how
the
timid
country
girl
shrink
through
the
crowd
that
hurry
up
and
down
the
street
,
give
way
to
the
press
of
people
,
and
cling
closely
to
Ralph
as
though
she
fear
to
lose
him
in
the
throng
;
and
how
the
stern
and
hard
-
featured
man
of
business
go
doggedly
on
,
elbow
the
passenger
aside
,
and
now
and
then
exchange
a
gruff
salutation
with
some
pass
acquaintance
,
who
turn
to
look
back
upon
his
pretty
charge
,
with
look
expressive
of
surprise
,
and
seem
to
wonder
at
the
ill
-
assort
companionship
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
it
would
have
be
a
strange
contrast
still
,
to
have
read
the
heart
that
be
beat
side
by
side
;
to
have
lay
bare
the
gentle
innocence
of
the
one
,
and
the
rugged
villainy
of
the
other
;
to
have
hang
upon
the
guileless
thought
of
the
affectionate
girl
,
and
be
amazed
that
,
among
all
the
wily
plot
and
calculation
of
the
old
man
,
there
should
not
be
one
word
or
figure
denote
thought
of
death
or
of
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
but
so
it
be
;
and
strange
still
---
though
this
be
a
thing
of
every
day
---
the
warm
young
heart
palpitate
with
a
thousand
anxiety
and
apprehension
,
while
that
of
the
old
worldly
man
lie
rust
in
its
cell
,
beat
only
as
a
piece
of
cunne
mechanism
,
and
yield
no
one
throb
of
hope
,
or
fear
,
or
love
,
or
care
,
for
any
live
thing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Uncle
,
"
say
Kate
,
when
she
judge
they
must
be
near
their
destination
,
"
I
must
ask
one
question
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
live
at
home
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
at
home
!
"
reply
Ralph
;
"
where
be
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
with
my
mother
---
the
WIDOW
,
"
say
Kate
emphatically
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
live
,
to
all
intent
and
purpose
,
here
,
"
rejoin
Ralph
;
"
for
here
you
will
take
your
meal
,
and
here
you
will
be
from
morning
till
night
---
occasionally
perhaps
till
morning
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
at
night
,
I
mean
,
"
say
Kate
;
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
leave
her
,
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
some
place
that
I
can
call
a
home
;
it
will
be
wherever
she
be
,
you
know
,
and
may
be
a
very
humble
one

"
   
<EOS>
"
May
be
!
"
<EOS>
say
Ralph
,
walk
faster
,
in
the
impatience
provoke
by
the
remark
;
"
must
be
,
you
mean
.
 
<EOS>
May
be
a
humble
one
!
 
<EOS>
be
the
girl
mad
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
the
word
slip
from
my
lip
,
I
do
not
mean
it
indeed
,
"
urge
Kate
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
say
Ralph
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
my
question
,
uncle
;
you
have
not
answer
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
anticipate
something
of
the
kind
,
"
say
Ralph
;
"
and
---
<EOS>
though
I
object
very
strongly
,
mind
---
have
provide
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
of
you
as
an
out
-
of
-
door
worker
;
so
you
will
go
to
this
home
that
may
be
humble
,
every
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
comfort
in
this
.
 
<EOS>
Kate
pour
forth
many
thank
for
her
uncle
's
consideration
,
which
Ralph
receive
as
if
he
have
deserve
them
all
,
and
they
arrive
without
any
further
conversation
at
the
dressmaker
's
door
,
which

very
large
plate
,
with
Madame

and
be

by
a
handsome
flight
of

<EOS>
there

His

be
originally
Muntle

but
it

by
an
easy
transition

into
Mantalini

serious
injury
to

after
patient
cultivation
by
the
addition
of
a
moustache

<EOS>
Newman
Noggs
induct
Mrs
and
Miss
Nickleby
into
their
New
dwelling
in
the
city
 
Miss
Nickleby
's
reflection
,
as
she
wend
her
way
homeward
,
be
of
that
desponding
nature
which
the
occurrence
of
the
morning
have
be
sufficiently
calculate
to
awaken
.
 
<EOS>
Her
uncle
's
be
not
a
manner
likely
to
dispel
any
doubt
or
apprehension
she
may
have
form
,
in
the
outset
,
neither
be
the
glimpse
she
have
have
of
Madame
Mantalini
's
establishment
by
any
mean
encouraging
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
with
many
gloomy
foreboding
and
misgiving
,
therefore
,
that
she
look
forward
,
with
a
heavy
heart
,
to
the
opening
of
her
new
career
.
   
<EOS>
if
her
mother
's
consolation
could
have
restore
her
to
a
pleasanter
and
more
enviable
state
of
mind
,
there
be
abundance
of
them
to
produce
the
effect
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
time
Kate
reach
home
,
the
good
lady
have
call
to
mind
two
authentic
case
of
milliner
who
have
be
possess
of
considerable
property
,
though
whether
they
have
acquire
it
all
in
business
,
or
have
have
a
capital
to
start
with
,
or
have
be
lucky
and
married
to
advantage
,
she
could
not
exactly
remember
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
she
very
logically
remark
,
there
must
have
be
some
young
person
in
that
way
of
business
who
have
make
a
fortune
without
have
anything
to
begin
with
,
and
that
be
take
for
grant
,
why
should
not
Kate
do
the
same
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
La
Creevy
,
who
be
a
member
of
the
little
council
,
venture
to
insinuate
some
doubt
relative
to
the
probability
of
Miss
Nickleby
's
arriving
at
this
happy
consummation
in
the
compass
of
an
ordinary
lifetime
;
but
the
good
lady
set
that
question
entirely
at
rest
,
by
inform
them
that
she
have
a
presentiment
on
the
subject
---
<EOS>
a
species
of
second
-
sight
with
which
she
have
be
in
the
habit
of
clench
every
argument
with
the
deceased
Mr
Nickleby
,
and
,
in
nine
case
and
three
-
quarter
out
of
every
ten
,
determine
it
the
wrong
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
be
an
unhealthy
occupation
,
"
say
Miss
La
Creevy
.
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
get
three
young
milliner
to
sit
to
me
,
when
I
first
begin
to
paint
,
and
I
remember
that
they
be
all
very
pale
and
sickly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
that
be
not
a
general
rule
by
any
mean

observe
Mrs
Nickleby
;

for
I
remember
,
as
well
as
if
it
be
only
yesterday

employ
one
that
I
be
particularly
recommend
to
,
to
make
me
a
scarlet
cloak
at
the
time
when
scarlet
cloak

fashionable

she

I
do
not

how
that
may
have
be
,
"
return
Mrs
Nickleby
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
know
she
have
a
very
red
face
,
so
your
argument
go
for
nothing

<EOS>
in
this
manner
,

with
like
powerful
reasoning
,
do
the
worthy
matron
meet
every
little
objection
that
present
itself
to
the
new
scheme
of
the
morning

<EOS>
Happy
Mrs
Nickleby

<EOS>
a
project

Mrs

equal
readiness

that
,
on
the
fine
evening
,
it
would
be
a
pleasant
amusement
for
her
to
walk
to
the
West
end
to
fetch
her
daughter
home
;
and
no

characteristically
forget
,
that
there
be
such
thing
as
wet
night
and
bad
weather
to
be
encounter
in
almost
every
week
of
the

"
I

on

make
a
deep
impression

<EOS>
"
You

me
off
,
for

"
reply
Miss
La

,
with
as
much
sprightliness
as
she
could
assume

<EOS>
"
I
shall
see
you
very
often

"
   
<EOS>
Newman
dart
a
meaning
glance
at
Kate

and
reply
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
last
word
of
his
answer
,
that
Mr

well

send
his

It
be
no
very
easy
matter
to
mistake
Newman
Noggs
,
after
have
once
see
him
,
and
as
Kate

attract
by
the
singularity
of
his
manner
(
in
which
on
this
occasion
,
however
,
there
be
something
respectful
and
even
delicate
,
notwithstanding
the
abruptness
of
his
speech

at

more
closely

catch
a

glimpse
of
that
strange
figure

<EOS>
"
excuse
my
curiosity

she
say
,
"
but
do
I
not
see
you
in
the
coachyard
,
on
the
morning

away
to
Yorkshire

<EOS>
Newman
cast
a
wistful
glance
on
Mrs

unblushingly

I

You

"
It

<EOS>
Newman
be
very
,
very
far
from

the
appearance
of
a
gouty
subject

so
Kate
could
not
help
think
;
but
the
conference
be
cut
short
by
Mrs
Nickleby
's
insist
on
have
the
door
shut
,
lest
Mr
Noggs
should
take
cold
,
and
further
persist
in

the

should
bring

another
attack

in
the
course
of

the
yellow

into
violent

(
that
be
to

the
coach

turban

go
away
again
,
with
the
two

and
their
luggage
inside

and
Newman
,
despite
all
Mrs

assurance

it

They

after

the

Newman
Noggs
do
not

that
he
have

up

the

suppose
it

remote

of
Miss
Fanny
Squeer

love

to
ascertain
whether

or
otherwise

<EOS>
It
be
a
fortunate
circumstance
for
Miss
Fanny
Squeers
,
that
when
her
worthy
papa
return
home
on
the
night
of
the
small
tea
-
party
,
he
be
what
the
initiate
term
"
too
far
go
"
to
observe
the
numerous
token
of
extreme
vexation
of
spirit
which
be
plainly
visible
in
her
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
Being
,
however
,
of
a
rather
violent
and
quarrelsome
mood
in
his
cup
,
it
be
not
impossible
that
he
may
have
fall
out
with
her
,
either
on
this
or
some
imaginary
topic
,
if
the
young
lady
have
not
,
with
a
foresight
and
prudence
highly
commendable
,
keep
a
boy
up

on
purpose

brunt
of
the
good
gentleman
's
anger

sufficiently

to
custom

to
curl
her
hair

perform
the
other
little
office
of
her
toilet
,
and
administer
as
much
flattery
as
she
could
get
up
,
for
the
purpose
;
for
Miss
Squeers
be
quite
lazy
enough
(
and
sufficiently
vain
and
frivolous
withal
)
to
have
be
a
fine
lady
;
and
it
be
only
the
arbitrary
distinction

rank

with
most
unfeigned
astonishment
a
look

tender
reproach
from
Miss

shrink
back
a
few
pace
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
the
fair
burden

go
on
to
say
:

I

very

unfortunate

it
be
a
most
awkward
thing

the

mention

I

sixty
thousand

it
would

precisely
the

<EOS>
I
have
not

it

I

this

not

feeling

to
impress
her

with
loathing

disgust

"
   
<EOS>
with
this
particularly
plain
and
straightforward
declaration
,
which
he
make
with
all
the
vehemence
that
his
indignant
and
excited
feeling
could
bring
to
bear
upon
it
,
Nicholas
wait
to
hear
no
more
,
retreat
.
   
<EOS>
but
poor
Miss
Squeers
!
 
<EOS>
Her
anger
,
rage
,
and
vexation
;
the
rapid
succession
of
bitter
and
passionate
feeling
that
whirl
through
her
mind
;
be
not
to
be
describe
.
 
<EOS>
Refused
!
<EOS>
refuse
by
a
teacher
,
pick
up
by
advertisement
,
at
an
annual
salary
of
five
pound
payable
at
indefinite
period
,
and
"
find
"
in
food
and
lodge
like
the
very
boy
themselves
;
and
this
too
in
the
presence
of
a
little
chit
of
a
miller
's
daughter
of
eighteen
,
who
be
go
to
be
marry
,
in
three
week
'
time
,
to
a
man
who
have
go
down
on
his
very
knee
to
ask
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
have
choke
in
right
good
earnest
,
at
the
thought
of
be
so
humble
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
there
be
one
thing
clear
in
the
midst
of
her
mortification
;
and
that
be
,
that
she
hate
and
detest
Nicholas
with
all
the
narrowness
of
mind
and
littleness
of
purpose
worthy
a
descendant
of
the
house
of
Squeers
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
one
comfort
too
;
and
that
be
,
that
every
hour
in
every
day
she
could
wound
his
pride
,
and
goad
him
with
the
infliction
of
some
slight
,
or
insult
,
or
deprivation
,
which
could
not
but
have
some
effect
on
the
most
insensible
person
,
and
must
be
acutely
feel
by
one
so
sensitive
as
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
with
these
two
reflection
uppermost
in
her
mind
,
Miss
Squeers
make
the
good
of
the
matter
to
her
friend
,
by
observe
that
Mr
Nickleby
be
such
an
odd
creature
,
and
of
such
a
violent
temper
,
that
she
fear
she
should
be
oblige
to
give
him
up
;
and
part
from
her
.
   
<EOS>
and
here
it
may
be
remark
,
that
Miss
Squeers
,
have
bestow
her
affection
(
or
whatever
it
may
be
that
,
in
the
absence
of
anything
well
,
represent
them
)
on
Nicholas
Nickleby
,
have
never
once
seriously
contemplate
the
possibility
of
his
being
of
a
different
opinion
from
herself
in
the
business
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Squeers
reason
that
she
be
prepossess
and
beautiful
,
and
that
her
father
be
master
,
and
Nicholas
man
,
and
that
her
father
have
save
money
,
and
Nicholas
have
none
,
all
of
which
seem
to
her
conclusive
argument
why
the
young
man
should
feel
only
too
much
honour
by
her
preference
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
fail
to
recollect
,
either
,
how
much
more
agreeable
she
could
render
his
situation
if
she
be
his
friend
,
and
how
much
more
disagreeable
if
she
be
his
enemy
;
and
,
doubtless
,
many
less
scrupulous
young
gentleman
than
Nicholas
would
have
encourage
her
extravagance
<EOS>
have
it
be
only
for
this
very
obvious
and
intelligible
reason
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
have
think
proper
to
do
otherwise
,
and
Miss
Squeers
be
outrageous
.
   
<EOS>
"
let
him
see
,
"
say
the
irritated
young
lady
,
when
she
have
regain
her
own
room
,
and
ease
her
mind
by
commit
an
assault
on
Phib
,
"
if
I
do
not
set
mother
against
him
a
little
more
when
she
come
back
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
scarcely
necessary
to
do
this
,
but
Miss
Squeers
be
as
good
as
her
word
;
and
poor
Nicholas
,
in
addition
to
bad
food
,
dirty
lodging
,
and
the
be
compel
to
witness
one
dull
unvarying
round
of
squalid
misery
,
be
treat
with
every
special
indignity
that
malice
could
suggest
,
or
the
most
grasp
cupidity
put
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
nor
be
this
all
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
and
deep
system
of
annoyance
which
make
his
heart
sink
,
and
nearly
drive
him
wild
,
by
its
injustice
and
cruelty
.
   
<EOS>
the
wretched
creature
,
Smike
,
since
the
night
Nicholas
have
speak
kindly
to
him
in
the
schoolroom
,
have
follow
him
to
and
fro
,
with
an
ever
-
restless
desire
to
serve
or
help
him
;
anticipate
such
little
want
as
his
humble
ability
could
supply
,
and
content
only
to
be
near
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
sit
beside
him
for
hour
,
look
patiently
into
his
face
;
and
a
word
would
brighten
up
his
care
-
wear
visage
,
and
call
into
it
a
pass
gleam
,
even
of
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
altered
being
;
he
have
an
object
now
;
and
that
object
be
,
to
show
his
attachment
to
the
only
person
---
that
person
a
stranger
---
who
have
treat
him
,
not
to
say
with
kindness
,
but
like
a
human
creature
.
   
<EOS>
upon
this
poor
being
,
all
the
spleen
and
ill
-
humour
that
could
not
be
vent
on
Nicholas
be
unceasingly
bestow
.
 
<EOS>
Drudgery
would
have
be
nothing
---
<EOS>
Smike
be
well
use
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
Buffetings
inflict
without
cause
,
would
have
be
equally
a
matter
of
course
;
for
to
them
also
he
have
serve
a
long
and
weary
apprenticeship
;
but
it
be
no
sooner
observe
that
he
have
become
attach
to
Nicholas
,
than
stripe
and
blow
,
stripe
and
blow
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
be
his
only
portion
.
 
<EOS>
Squeers
be
jealous
of
the
influence
which
his
man
have
so
soon
acquire
,
and
his
family
hate
him
,
and
Smike
pay
for
both
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
see
it
,
and
ground
his
tooth
at
every
repetition
of
the
savage
and
cowardly
attack
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
arrange
a
few
regular
lesson
for
the
boy
;
and
one
night
,
as
he
pace
up
and
down
the
dismal
schoolroom
,
his
swollen
heart
almost
burst
to
think
that
his
protection
and
countenance
should
have
increase
the
misery
of
the
wretched
be
<EOS>
whose
peculiar
destitution
have
awaken
his
pity
,
he
pause
mechanically
in
a
dark
corner
where
sit
the
object
of
his
thought
.
   
<EOS>
the
poor
soul
be
pore
hard
over
a
tattere
book
,
with
the
trace
of
recent
tear
still
upon
his
face
;
vainly
endeavour
to
master
some
task
which
a
child
of
nine
year
old
,
possess
of
ordinary
power
,
could
have
conquer
with
ease
,
but
which
,
to
the
addle
brain
of
the
crushed
boy
of
nineteen
,
be
a
sealed
and
hopeless
mystery
.

yet
there
he
sit

patiently
con
the

again
and
again

stimulate
by
no
boyish
ambition

uncouth

congregate
about

by
the

the
sharp

of
pale
face

over
which
the
sombre
light
shed
the

dull
heavy
colour
;
with

here

there

a
gaunt
arm
thrust
forth
:
its
thinness
hide
by
no

fully
expose
to

in
all
its
shrink
ugliness

<EOS>
there

on

just
visible
in

fantastic

the
uneasy
effort

gain
some
temporary
relief

a

peacefully
on

with
smile
upon
their
face

dream
perhaps
of
home
;
but
ever
and
again
a
deep
and
heavy
sigh
,
break
the
stillness
of
the
room
,
<EOS>
announce
that
some
new

misery

of
night

the

fade
away

with

friendly
darkness

upon
the
sleeper
;
at
first

with
the
air
of
one
who
gaze
upon
a
scene
which
,
though
familiar
to
him
,
have
lose
none
of
its
sorrowful
effect
in
consequence
;
and
,
afterwards
,
with
a
more
intense
and
searching
scrutiny
,
as
a
man
would
who
miss
something
his
eye
be
accustom
to
meet

have
expect
to
rest
upon

Mrs

the
perplex

remember
that

that
it
could
come
to

a
noisy
brawl

he
content
himself
with
dart
a
contemptuous
look
at
the
tyrant

such
bedclothe

sternly
resolve
that
the

spirit
for

which

Nicholas

window

he

so

the
very
first

the
wretched
Smike

so
bedabbled
with

"

out

<EOS>
upon
a
hasty
consideration

the
circumstance

it

be
matter
of
surprise
to
some
person

that
Mr

repossess
themselves
of
an
incumbrance

which
it

will

complain
so
loudly

their
surprise
will
cease
when
they
be
inform
that
the
manifold
service
of
the
drudge
,
if
perform
by
anybody
else
,
would
have
cost
the

some
ten

twelve

severe
example

in

<EOS>
on

however

until
afternoon
;
when
Squeers

have
refresh
himself
with
his
dinner

and
further
strengthen

by
an
extra
libation
or
so

make
his
appearance
(

so
Squeers

along

It

one
small
observer

that
there
be
a
very
curious
and
unusual
expression
in
the
usher

face
;
but
he
take
his
seat
,
without
open
his
lip
in
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Squeers
,
cast
a
triumphant
glance
at
his
assistant
and
a
look
of
most
comprehensive
despotism
on
the
boy
,
leave
the
room
,
and
shortly
afterwards
return
,
drag
Smike
by
the
collar
---
or
rather
by
that
fragment
of
his
jacket
which
be
near
<EOS>
the
place
where
his
collar
would
have
be
<EOS>

such
a
decoration

<EOS>
in
any
other
place

the
appearance
of
the
wretched

jade

spiritless
object
would
have
occasion
a
murmur
of
compassion
and
remonstrance
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
some
effect
,
even
there
;
for
the
looker

on
move
uneasily
in
their
seat
;
and
a
few
of
the
bold
venture

steal
look

expressive
of
indignation

They

throw
all
his
remain
strength
into
half
-
a
-
dozen
finishing
cut
,
and
fling
Squeers
from
him
with
all
the
force
he
could
muster
.
<EOS>
the
violence
of
his
fall
precipitate
Mrs
Squeers
completely
over
an
adjacent
form
;
and
Squeers
strike
his
head
against
it
in
his
descent
,
lie
at
his
full
length
on
the
ground
,
stunned
and
motionless
.
   
<EOS>
have
bring
affair
to
this
happy
termination
,
and
ascertain
,
to
his
thorough
satisfaction
,
that
Squeers
be
only
stunned
,
and
not
dead
(
upon
which
point
he
have
have
some
unpleasant
doubt
at
first
)
,
Nicholas
leave
his
family
to
restore
him
,
and
retire
to
consider
what
course
he
have
better
adopt
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
anxiously
round
for
Smike
,
as
he
leave
the
room
,
but
he
be
nowhere
to
be
see
.
   
<EOS>
after
a
brief
consideration
,
he
pack
up
a
few
clothe
in
a
small
leathern
valise
,
and
,
find
that
nobody
offer
to
oppose
his
progress
,
march
boldly
out
by
the
front
-
door
,
and
shortly
afterwards
,
strike
into
the
road
which
lead
to
Greta
Bridge
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
have
cool
sufficiently
to
be
enable
to
give
his
present
circumstance
some
little
reflection
,
they
do
not
appear
in
a
very
encouraging
light
;
he
have
only
four
shilling
and
a
few
penny
in
his
pocket
,
and
be
something
more
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
mile
from
London
,
whither
he
resolve
to
direct
his
step
,
that
he
may
ascertain
,
among
other
thing
,
what
account
of
the
morning
's
proceeding
<EOS>
Mr
Squeers
transmit
to
his
most
affectionate
uncle
.
   
<EOS>
lift
up
his
eye
,
as
he
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
there
be
no
remedy
for
this
unfortunate
state
of
thing
,
he
behold
a
horseman
come
towards
him
,
whom
,
on
near
approach
,
he
discover
,
to
his
infinite
chagrin
,
to
be
no
other
than
Mr
John
Browdie
,
who
,
clothe
in
cord
and
leather
legging
,
be
urge
his
animal
forward
by
mean
of
a
thick
ash
stick
,
which
seem
to
have
be
recently
cut
from
some
stout
saple
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
no
mood
for
more
noise
and
riot
,
"
think
Nicholas
,
"
and
yet
,
do
what
I
will
,
I
shall
have
an
altercation
with
this
honest
blockhead
,
and
perhaps
a
blow
or
two
from
yonder
staff
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
truth
,
there
appear
some
reason
to
expect
that
such
a
result
would
follow
from
the
encounter
,
for
John
Browdie
<EOS>
no
sooner
see
Nicholas
advance
,
than
he
rein
in
his
horse
by
the
footpath
,
and
wait
until
such
time
as
he
should
come
up
;
look
meanwhile
,
very
sternly
between
the
horse
's
ear
,
at
Nicholas
,
as
he
come
on

<EOS>
John

make
no
verbal
answer
to
this
remark

but
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
pull
out
an
old
purse
of
solid
leather
,
and
insist
that
Nicholas
should
borrow
from
him
whatever
he
require

<EOS>
Nicholas
could
by
no

be
prevail
upon
to
borrow
more
than
a
sovereign
,
with
which
loan
Mr

,
after
many
entreaty
that
he
would
accept
of
more
(
observe

with
a
touch

caution

<EOS>
so
say
,
and
indulge
,
with
more
delicacy
than
may
have
be
expect
from
him
,
in
another
series
of
loud
laugh
,
for
the
purpose

avoid
the
thank
which
Nicholas
pour
forth
,
John
Browdie
set
spur
to
his
horse
,
and
go
off
at
a
smart
canter
:
look
back
,
from
time
to
time
,
as
Nicholas
stand
gaze
after
him
,
and
wave
his
hand
cheerily
,
as
if
to
encourage
him
on
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
watch
the
horse
and
rider
until
they
disappear
over
the
brow
of

distant
hill

then
set
forward
on
his
journey
.
   
<EOS>
He
do
not
travel
far
that
afternoon
,
for
by
this
time
it
be
nearly
dark

and
there
have
be
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
,
which
not
only
render
the
way
toilsome
,
but
the
track
uncertain
and
difficult
to
find

after

He
lie

that
night

at

before

to
Boroughbridge

<EOS>
pass
through
that
town
in

of
some
cheap
resting

place
,
he
stumble
upon
an
empty
barn
within
a
couple
of
hundred
yard
of
the
roadside
;
in
a
warm
corner
of
which
,
he
stretch
his
weary
limb
,
and
soon
fall
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
awake
next
morning
,
and
try
to
recollect
his
dream
,
which
have
be
all

with
his
recent
sojourn
at
Dotheboys
Hall
,
he
sit
up
,
rub
his
eye
and
stare
---
not
with
the
most
compose
countenance
possible
---
at
some
motionless
object
which
seem
to
be
station
within
a
few
yard
in

of
him

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
beautiful

order
them
about

more

admirably
select

<EOS>
there
be
,
first
of
all
,
Mr
Kenwigs
and
Mrs
Kenwigs
,
and
four
olive
Kenwigses
who
sit
up
to
supper
;
firstly
,
because
it
be
but
right
that
they
should
have
a
treat
on
such
a
day
;
and
secondly
,
because
their
go
to
bed
,
in
presence
of
the
company
,
would
have
be
inconvenient
,
not
to
say
improper
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
a
young
lady
who
have
make
Mrs
Kenwigs
's
dress
,
and
who
---
it
be
the
most
convenient
thing
in
the
world
---
live
in
the
two

pair
back
,
give
up
her
bed
to
the
baby
,
and
get
a
little
girl
to
watch
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
to
match
this
young
lady
,
be
a
young
man
,
who
have
know
Mr

when
he
be
a
bachelor
,
and
be
much
esteem
by
the
lady
,
as
bear
the
reputation
of

<EOS>
to
these
be
add
a
newly

marry
couple
,
who
have
visit
Mr
and
Mrs
Kenwigs
in
their
courtship
;
and
a
sister
of
Mrs

who
be
quite
a
beauty
;
besides
whom
,
there
be
another
young
man
,
suppose
to
entertain
honourable
design
upon
the
lady
last
mention
;
and
Mr
Noggs
,
who
be
a
genteel
person
to
ask
,
because
he
have
be
a
gentleman
once
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
also
an
elderly
lady
from
the
back
-
parlour
,
and
one
more
young
lady
,
who
,
next
to
the
collector
,
perhaps
be
the
great
lion
of
the
party
,
be
the
daughter
of
a
theatrical
fireman
,
who
"
go
on
"
in
the
pantomime
,
and
have
the
great
turn
for
the
stage
that
be
ever
know
,
be
able
to
sing
and
recite
in
a
manner
that
bring
the
tear
into
Mrs
Kenwigs
's
eye
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
drawback
upon
the
pleasure
of
see
such
friend
,
and
that
be
,
that
the
lady
in
the
back
-
parlour
,
who
be
very
fat
,
and
turn
of
sixty
,
come
in
a
low
book
-
muslin
dress
and
short
kid
glove
,
which
so
exasperate
Mrs

,
that
that
lady
assure
her
visitor

in
private

that
if
it
have
not
happen
that
the
supper
be
cook
at

she

<EOS>
Newman
's
first
act
be
to
compel
Nicholas
,
with
gentle
force
,
to
swallow
half
of
the
punch
at
a
breath
,
nearly
boil
as
it

his
next
,
to
pour
the
remainder
down

"
   
<EOS>
Newman
do
not
look
the
less
distressed
to
hear
Nicholas
talk
in
this
strain
;
but
,
upon
his
young
friend
grasp
him
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
assure
him
that
nothing
but
implicit
confidence
in
the
sincerity
of
his
profession

kindness
of
feeling
towards
himself
,
would
have
induce
him

on
any
consideration

even
to
have
make
him
acquaint

Mr

brighten
up
again

go
about
make
such
arrangement

be
in
his
power
for
the
comfort
of
his
visitor

with
extreme
alacrity
.
   
<EOS>
these
be
simple
enough
;
poor
Newman
's
mean
halt
at
a
very
considerable
distance
short
of
his
inclination
;
but
,
slight
as
they
be
,
they
be
not
make
without
much
bustling
and
run
about
.
<EOS>
as
Nicholas
have
husband
his
scanty
stock
of
money
,
so
well
that
it
be
not

cold
beef

upon
the
table
;
and
these
viand
be
flank
by
a
bottle
of
spirit
and
a
pot
of
porter
,
there
be
no
ground
for
apprehension
on
the
score
of
hunger
or
thirst
,
at
all
event

<EOS>
such
preparation
as
Newman
have
it
in
his
power
to
make
,
for
the
accommodation
of
his
guest
during
the
night
,
occupy
no
very
great
time
in
complete
;
and
as
he
have
insist
,
as
an
express
preliminary
,
that
Nicholas
should
change
his
clothe
,
and
that
Smike
should
invest
himself
in
his
solitary
coat
(
which
no
entreaty
would
dissuade
him
from
strip
off
for
the
purpose
)
,
the
traveller
partook
of
their
frugal
fare
,
with
more
satisfaction
than
one
of
them
at

have
derive
from
many
a
well
meal

<EOS>
They
then
draw
near
the
fire
,
which
Newman
Noggs
have
make
up
as
well
as
he
could
,
after
the
inroad
of
Crowl
upon
the
fuel
;
and
Nicholas
,
who
have
hitherto
be
restrain
by
the
extreme
anxiety
of
his
friend
that

should
refresh
himself
after

him
with
earnest
question

his
mother
and
sister

<EOS>
"

taciturnity

<EOS>
Newman
open
his

rather
wider

by
a
gasp

the
answer
as
a
favourable
one

several

to

could
make
nothing

Mr

nothing

then
the
whisperer

nod
fiercely
to

give
their

great
alacrity

entreat

extraordinary
politeness

the

nearest
the

retort

with
equal
courtesy

that
they
could
not

of
such
a

on

they
do
it

without

some

dozen

forward

close
up

up

into

very
sitting

room
of
Mr

which
they
be
thus
compel
to
enter
with
most
unseemly
precipitation

without

there

My

Mr

solemn
aspect

<EOS>
"
My
secretary
would
have
to
make
himself
master
of
the
foreign
policy
of
the
world
,
as
it
be
mirror
in
the
newspaper
;
to
run
his
eye
over
all
account
of
public
meeting

all
lead
article
,

account
of
the
proceeding
of
public
body

to
make
note
of
anything
which
it
appear

may
be
make
a
point
of

little
speech

I

I

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
Mr

"
it
would
be
necessary

himself
acquaint

event

I

he
would
have
to

the
question

much

I
remember

the
answer
(
include
a
little
compliment
about
independence

to

a

to
go
through
a

figure

to
pick
out

that
I
may
come
out
pretty
well
on
timber
duty
question

finance
question

so
on

I
should

get
up
a

little
argument

which
one
can
not

to

a
curse
about

inferior
people

well
off

else

<EOS>

I
should
wish
my

to
get
together
a

little
flourishing
speech

of
a
patriotic
cast

for
instance

if
any
preposterous
bill
be
bring
forward

for
give
poor
grubbing
devil
of
author
a
right
to

I
should

that
I
for
one
would
never
consent
to
oppose
an
insurmountable
bar
to
the
diffusion
of
literature
among
the
PEOPLE

---
you
understand

that
the
creation
of
the
pocket
,
be
man
's
,
may
belong
to
one
man
,

one
family
;
but
that
the
creation
of
the
brain
,
be
God
's
,
ought
as
a
matter
of
course
to
belong
to
the
people
at
large
---
and
if
I
be
pleasantly
disposed
,
I
should
like
to
make
a
joke
about
posterity
,
and
say
that
those
who
write
for
posterity
should
be
content
to
be
reward
by
the
approbation
of
posterity
;
it
may
take
with
the
house
,
and
could
never
do
me
any
harm
,
because
posterity
can
not

expect
to
know
anything
about
me

my
joke
either

do
you
see
?

I
see
that
,

You

always
bear
in

you

sit

french

initiatory
lesson

off

here
it
may
be
observe
,
that
Nicholas
be
not
,
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
,
a
young
man
of
high
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
resent
an
affront
to
himself

interpose
to
redress
a
wrong
offer
to
another
,
as
boldly
and
freely
as
any
knight
that
ever
set
lance
in
rest
;
but
he
lack
that
peculiar
excess
of
coolness
and
great
-
minded
selfishness
,
which
invariably
distinguish
gentleman
of
high
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
in
truth
,
for
our
own
part
,
we
be
dispose
to
look
upon
such
gentleman

be
rather
incumbrance

otherwise
in

family

happen
to
be
acquaint
with
several
whose
spirit
prevent
their
settle
down
to
any
grovel
occupation
,
and
only
display
itself
in
a
tendency
to
cultivate
moustachio
,
and
look
fierce
;
and
although
moustachio
and
ferocity
be
both
very
pretty
thing
in
their
way
,
and
very
much
to
be
commend
,
we
confess
to
a
desire
to
see
them
breed
at
the
owner
's
proper
cost
,
rather
than
at
the
expense
of
low
-
spirited
people

<EOS>
Nicholas
,
therefore
,
not
be
a
high
-
spirited
young
man
accord
to
common
parlance

deem
it
a
great
degradation
to
borrow
,
for
the
supply
of
his
necessity
,
from
Newman
Noggs
,
than
to
teach
French
to
the
little

accept

here
Miss

to
take
breath

while
she
pause
it
may
be
observe

not
that
she
be
marvellously
loquacious

marvellously
deferential
to
Madame
Mantalini

since
these
be
fact

that
every

<EOS>
the

some

introduce
the

It

further
remark

that
Miss

there

<EOS>
Kate
may
have
say
,
that
mourning
be
sometimes
the
cold
wear

mortal

assume

that
it
not

chill
the
breast

freeze

"
   
<EOS>
there
have
exist
not

accord

increase
by

the
knowledge
that
it
pain
her

be
sufficient
to
repress
even
this
curiosity

Miss

find
it
hopeless

reluctantly
command
silence

the
meal
over

enjoy
the
additional
relaxation
of
wash
their

the
work
begin
again

again
perform
in
silence

until
the
noise
of
carriage
rattle
through
the
street
,
and
of
loud
double
knock
at
door
,
give
token
that
the
day

work

the
more
fortunate
member

society

proceed
in
its
turn

<EOS>
one
of
these
double
knock
at
Madame
Mantalini
's
door
,
announce
the
equipage
of
some
great
lady
---
or
rather
rich
one
,
for
there
be
occasionally
a
distinction
between
riches
and
greatness
---
who
have
come
with
her
daughter
to
approve
of
some
court

dress
which
have
be
a
long
time
prepare
,
and
upon
whom
Kate
be
depute
to
wait
,
accompany
by
Miss
Knag
,
and
officer
of
course
by
Madame
Mantalini
.
   
<EOS>
Kate
's
part
in
the
pageant
be
humble
enough
,
<EOS>
her
duty
be
limit
to
hold
article
of
costume
until
Miss

be
ready
to
try
them
on

now

then
tie
a
string

fasten
a
hook

eye

<EOS>
She
may
,
not
unreasonably
,
have
suppose
herself
beneath
the
reach
of
any
arrogance
,
or
bad
humour
;
but
it
happen
that
the
lady
and
daughter
be
both
out
of
temper
that
day
,
and
the
poor
girl
come
in
for
her
share
of
their
reviling
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
awkward
<EOS>
---
her
hand
be
cold
---
<EOS>
dirty
---
coarse
<EOS>
---
she
could
do
nothing
right
;
they
wonder
how
Madame
Mantalini
could
have
such
people
about
her
;
request
they
may
see
some
other
young
woman
the
next

they
come

so
forth

<EOS>
so
common
an
occurrence
would
be
hardly
deserve

for
its
effect

<EOS>
Kate
shed
many
bitter
tear
when
these
people
be
go
,
and
feel
,
for
the
first
time

humble
by
her
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
,
it
be
true
,
quail
at
the
prospect
of
drudgery
and
hard
service
;
but
she
have
feel
no
degradation
in
work
for
her
bread
,
until
she
find
herself
expose
to
insolence
and
pride
.
 
<EOS>
Philosophy
would
have
teach
her
that
the
degradation
be
on
the
side
of
those
who
have
sink
so
low
as
to
display
such
passion
habitually
,
and
without
cause
:
but
she
be
too
young
for
such
consolation
,
and
her
honest
feeling
be
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
May
not
the
complaint
<EOS>
,
that
common
people
be
above
their
station
,
often
take
its
rise
in
the
fact
of
UNcommon
people
be
below
theirs

<EOS>
in
such
scene

occupation
<EOS>
the

hasten
from
the
confinement

the
workroom

to
join
her
mother
at
the
street
corner

walk
home

the
more
sadly

from
have

disguise
her
real

feign

participate
in
all
the
sanguine

<EOS>
Miss
Knag
,
after
dote
on
Kate
Nickleby
for
three
whole
day

make
up
her
mind
to
hate
her
for
evermore

<EOS>
the
Causes
which
lead
Miss
Knag
to
form
this
resolution
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
life
of
much
pain
,
hardship
,
and
suffering
,
which
,
have
no
stirring
interest
for
any
but
those
who
lead
them
,
be
disregard
by
person
who
do
not
want
thought
or
feeling
,
but
who
pamper
their
compassion
and
need
high
stimulant
to
rouse
it
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
few
among
the
disciple
of
charity
who
require
,
in
their
vocation
,
scarcely
less
excitement
than
the
votary
of
pleasure
in
theirs
;
and
hence
it
be
that
disease
sympathy
and
compassion
be
every
day
expend
on
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
object
,
when
only
too
many
demand
upon
the
legitimate
exercise
of
the
same
virtue
in
a
healthy
state
,
be
constantly
within
the
sight
and
hearing
of
the
most
unobservant
person
alive

<EOS>
in
short
,
charity
must
have
its
romance
,
as
the
novelist
or
playwright
must
have
his
.
<EOS>
a
thief
in
fustian
be
a
vulgar
character
,
scarcely
to
be
think
of
by
person
of
refinement
;
but
dress
him
in
green
velvet
,
with
a
high
-
crown
hat
,
and
change
the
scene
of
his
operation
,
from
a
thickly
-
people
city
,
to
a
mountain
road
,
and
you
shall
find
in
him
the
very
soul
of
poetry
and
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
so
it
be
with
the
one
great
cardinal
virtue
,
which
,
properly
nourish
and
exercise
,
<EOS>
lead
to
,
if
it
do
not
necessarily
include
,
all
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
have
its
romance
;
and
the
less

real

hard

struggle
work

a

<EOS>
there

unhealthy

make
up
its
sum

it

I

why
really

ordinary
!
"
cry
Miss

with
a
countenance
beam
delight
;

awkward
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
all
I
can
say
be
,
Madame
Mantalini
,
that
I
quite
love
the
poor
girl
;
and
that
if
she
be
twice
as
indifferent
-
look
,
and
twice
as
awkward
as
she
be
,
I
should
be
only
so
much
the
more
her
friend
,
and
that
be
the
truth
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Miss
Knag
have
conceive
an
incipient
affection
for
Kate
Nickleby
,
after
witness
her
failure
that
morning
,
and
this
short
conversation
with
her
superior
increase
the
favourable
prepossession
to
a
most
surprising
extent
;
which
be
the
more
remarkable
,
as
when
she
first
scan
that
young
lady
's
face
and
figure
,
she
have
entertain
certain
inward
misgiving
that
they
would
never
agree
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
now
,
"
say
Miss
Knag
,
glance
at
the
reflection
of
herself
in
a
mirror
at
no
great
distance
,
"
I
love
her
---
<EOS>
I
quite
love
her
---
<EOS>
I
declare
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
of
such
a
highly
disintereste
quality
be
this
devoted
friendship
,
and
so
superior
be
it
to
the
little
weakness
of
flattery
or
ill
-
nature
,
that
the
kind
-
hearted
Miss
Knag
candidly
inform
Kate
Nickleby
,
next
day
,
that
she
see
she
would
never
do
for
the
business
,
but
that
she
nee
not
give
herself
the
slight
uneasiness
on
this
account
,
for
that
she
(
Miss
Knag
)
,
by
increase
exertion
on
her
own
part
,
would
keep
her
as
much
as
possible
in
the
background
,
and
that
all
she
would
have
to
do
,
would
be
to
remain
perfectly
quiet
before
company
,
and
to
shrink
from
attract
notice
by
every
mean
in
her
power
.
 
<EOS>
this
last
suggestion
be
so
much
in
accordance
with
the
timid
girl
's
own
feeling
and
wish
,
that
she
readily
promise
implicit
reliance
on
the
excellent
spinster
's
advice
:
without
question
,
or
indeed
bestow
a
moment
's
reflection
upon
,
the
motive
that
dictate
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
take
quite
a
lively
interest

Miss

a

interest

actually

<EOS>
It
be
the
most
singular
circumstance
I
ever
know

"
   
<EOS>
undoubtedly
it
be
singular
,
that
if
Miss
Knag
do
feel
a
strong
interest
in
Kate
Nickleby
,
it
should
not
rather
have
be
the
interest
of
a
maiden
aunt
or
grandmother
;
that
be
the
conclusion
to
which
the
difference
in
their
respective
age
would
have
naturally
tend
.
 
<EOS>
but
Miss
Knag
wear
clothe
of
a
very
youthful
pattern

and
perhaps
her
feeling
take
the

shape

bestow
a
kiss
upon
Kate

very
awkward
you
have

all

I
fear
your

that

that

any

the
fact
be

that
he
do
find
so
much
in

read

applicable
to
his

misfortune

do
find
himself
in

respect
so
much

of
course
he
be
conscious
of
his
own
superiority

as
we
all
be
,

very
naturally
---
that
he
take
to
scorn
everything

become
a
genius

I
be
quite
sure
that
he
be
,
at

write
another

another

nod

triumph

it

in

his
little
fashionable
description

to
have
the
benefit
of
my

of

few
author
who
write

can
have
such
opportunity

know

I
have

wrap
up

the
least
allusion

business

worldly
matter

like
that
woman
just
now

for
instance

quite
distract
him
;
but
,
as
I
often
say
,
I
think
his
disappointment
a
great
thing
for
him
,
because
if
he
have
not
be
disappoint
he
could
not
have
write
about
blight
hope
and
all
that
;
and
the
fact
be
,
if
it
have
not
happen
as
it
have
,
I
do
not
believe
his
genius
would
ever
have
come
out
at
all

<EOS>
how
much
more
communicative
Miss

may
have
become
under
more
favourable
circumstance

it
be
impossible
to
divine

gloomy

It
be
a
satisfactory
thing
to
hear
that
the
old
gentleman
be
go
to
lead
a
new
life

for
it
be
pretty
evident
that

him
much
longer

<EOS>
the
mere
exertion
of
protract
chuckle
reduce
him
to
a
fearful
ebb

gasping

it

he
could
find
breath
to
remark
that
the

pretty

catch

induce

some
new
voice

the
tone
of
Mr

be
easily
distinguishable
at
first
,
but
by
degree
they
merge
into
the
general
buzz

all
she

ascertain
be
,
that
there
be
several
gentleman
with
no

talk
very
loud

laugh
very
heartily

Kate
would

<EOS>
one
be
the
flippant
contempt
with
which
the

the

insolence

that
the

and
here
Mr

a
young
lady
(
by

may
be

however
unacquainted

the
chance

sense

propriety
of

as
if

possibly
a

<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
not

to
see
,
<EOS>
that
the
majority
of

prey
upon
the
unfortunate
young
lord

who
,
weak
and
silly
as
he
be
,
appear
by
far
the
least
vicious

<EOS>
Sir

be
remarkable
for
his
tact
in
ruin

by
himself

young
gentleman

a
genteel
and
elegant
profession

of

undoubtedly
gain
the
head

<EOS>
with
all
the
boldness
of
an
original
genius
,
he
have
strike
out
an
entirely
new
course
of
treatment
quite
opposed
to
the
usual
method
;
his
custom
being
,
when
he
have
gain
the
ascendancy
over
those
he
take
in
hand
,
rather
to
keep
them
down
than
to
give
them
their
own
way
;
and
to
exercise
his
vivacity
upon
them
openly
,
and
without
reserve
.
<EOS>
thus
,
he
make
them
butts
,
in
a
double
sense

empty
them
with
great
address

cause

<EOS>
the
dinner

as
remarkable
for
the
splendour

its
appointment

be
remarkable
for
do
it
ample
justice

in
which
respect
Messrs

particularly
signalise
themselves
;
these
two
gentleman

perseverance
truly
astonishing

they
break
out
again

as

the
nerve
about

could

although
this

His

that
it

do
you
mean
to
say
that
if
he
have
find
his
way
up
here
instead
of
me

you
would
not
have
be
a
little
more
blind
,

a
little
more
deaf
,

a

less
flourishing
,
than
you

<EOS>
Come
,
Nickleby
,
answer
me
that
.
"
   
<EOS>

I
tell
you
this

Ralph

that
if
I

her
here

business

ay
,
that
be
the
word

interpose
Sir

with
a
laugh

You
be
come
to
yourself
again
now

"
   
<EOS>
"
---
as
a
matter
of
business
,
"
pursue
Ralph
,
speak
slowly
and
firmly
,
as
a
man
who
have
make
up
his
mind
to
say
no
more
,
"
because
I
think
she
may
make
some
impression
on
the
silly
youth
you
have
take
in
hand
and
be
lend
good
help
to
ruin
<EOS>
,
I
know
---
know
him
---
that
it
would
be
long
before
he
outrage
her
girl
's
feeling
,
and
that
unless
he
offend
by
mere
puppyism
and
emptiness
,
he
would
,
with
a
little
management
,
respect
the
sex
and
conduct
even
of
his
usurer
's
niece
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
think
to
draw
him
on
more
gently
by
this
device
,
I
do
not
think
of
subject
the
girl
to
the
licentiousness

brutality
of
so
old
a
hand

you

there
be
nothing

by
it

sneer
Sir

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exactly
so
,
"

Ralph

<EOS>
He
have
turn
away
,

look
over
his
shoulder
to
make
this
last
reply
.
 
<EOS>
the
eye
of
the
two
worthy
meet
,
with
an
expression
as

each
rascal
feel
that
there
be
no

himself
from
the

Sir

Hawk
shrug
his
shoulder

slowly
out

His

close
the

his

remain
in
the
attitude

he
have
leave
her

She
have
fling
herself
heavily
upon

couch

with
her
head
droop
over
the
cushion

her
face
hide
in
her
hand

seem
to
be
still
weep
in
an
agony
of
shame

grief

<EOS>
Ralph
would
have
walk
into
any
poverty
-
stricken
debtor
's
house
,
and
point
him
out
to
a
bailiff
,
though
in
attendance
upon
a
young
child
's
death
-
bed
,
without
the
small
concern
,
because
it
would
have
be
a
matter
quite
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
,
and
the
man
would
have
be
an
offender
against
his
only
code
of
morality
.
<EOS>
but
,
here
be
a
young
girl
,
who
have
do
no
wrong
save
<EOS>
that
of
come
into
the
world
alive

who
have
patiently
yield
to
all
his

who
have
try
hard
to
please
him

above
all

who
do
not

him
money

awkward

nervous

Ralph
take
a
chair
at
some
distance
;
then
,
another
chair
a
little
nearer
;
then
,
move
a
little
nearer
still
;

nearer
again

finally
sit
himself
on

lay
his

on

home

"
well

well

I
will

you
must
get
back
your

frighten

in
the

manner

when

it
prudent
to
allow

depart

her
downstair

after
adjust

most
probably
for

across

the

fire

there
may

some

Nicholas
,
accompany
by
Smike
,
sally
forth
to
seek
his
Fortune
.
<EOS>
He
encounter
Mr
Vincent
Crummles
;
and
who
he
be
,
be
herein
make
manifest
 
<EOS>
the
whole
capital
which
Nicholas
find
himself
entitle
to
,
either
in
possession
,
reversion
,
remainder
,
or
expectancy
,
after
pay
his
rent
and
settle
with
the
broker
from
whom
he
have
hire
his
poor
furniture
,
do
not
exceed
,
by
more
than
a
few
halfpence
,
the
sum
of
twenty
shilling
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
hail
the
morning
on
which
he
have
resolve
to
quit
London
,
with
a
light
heart
,
and
spring
from
his
bed
with
an
elasticity
of
spirit
which
be
happily
the
lot
of
young
person
,
or
the
world
would
never
be
stock
with
old
one
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
cold
,
dry
,
foggy
morning
in
early
spring
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
meagre
shadow
flit
to
and
fro
in
the
misty
street
,
and
occasionally
there
loom
through
the
dull
vapour
,
<EOS>
the
heavy
outline
of
some
hackney
coach
wend
homeward
,
which
,
draw
slowly
nearer
,
roll
jangle
by
,
scatter
the
thin
crust
of
frost
from
its
whitened
roof
,
and
soon
be
lose
again
in
the
cloud
.
 
<EOS>
at
interval
be
hear
the
tread
of
slipshod
foot
,
and
the
chilly
cry
of
the
poor
sweep
as
he
creep
,
shivering
,
to
his
early
toil
;
the
heavy
footfall
of
the
official
watcher
of
the
night
,
pace
slowly
up
and
down
and
curse
the
tardy
hour
that
still
intervene
between
him
and
sleep
;
the
rambling
of
ponderous
cart
and
waggon
;
the
roll
of
the
light
vehicle
which
carry
buyer
and
seller
to
the
different
market
;
the
sound
of
ineffectual
knocking
at
the
door
of
heavy
sleeper
---
all
these
noise
fall
upon
the
ear
from
time
to
time
,
but
all
seem
muffle
by
the
fog
,
and
to
be
render
almost
as
indistinct
to
the
ear
as
be
every
object
to
the
sight
.
 
<EOS>
the
sluggish
darkness
thicken
as
the
day
come
on
;
and
those
who
have
the
courage
to
rise
and
peep
at
the
gloomy
street
from
their
curtain
window
,
creep
back
to
bed
again
,
and
coil
themselves
up
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
before
even
these
indication
of
approach
morning
be
rife
in
busy
London
,
Nicholas
have
make
his
way
alone
to
the
city
,
and
stand
beneath
the
window
of
his
mother
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
dull
and
bare
to
see
,
but
it
have
light
and
life
for
him
;
for
there
be
at
least
one
heart
within
its
old
wall
to
which
insult
or
dishonour
would
bring
the
same
blood
rushing
,
that
flow
in
his
own
vein
.
   
<EOS>
He
cross
the
road
,
and
raise
his
eye
to
the
window
of
the
room
where
he
know
his
sister
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
closed
and
dark
.
 
<EOS>
"
poor
girl
,
"
think
Nicholas
,
"
she
little
think
who
linger
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
look
again
,
and
feel
,
for
the
moment
,
almost
vexed
that
Kate
be
not
there
to
exchange
one
word
at
parting
.
 
<EOS>
"
good
God
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
think
,
suddenly
correct
himself
,
"
what
a
boy
I
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
as
it
be
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
after
he
have
lounge
on
,
a
few
pace
,
and
return
to
the
same
spot
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
I
leave
them
before
,
and
could
have
say
goodbye
a
thousand
time
if
I
have
choose
,
I
spare
them
the
pain
of
leave
-
taking
,
and
why
not
now
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
some
fancied
motion
of
the
curtain
almost
persuade
him
,
for
the
instant
,
that
Kate
be
at
the
window
,
and
by
one
of
those
strange
contradiction
of
feeling
which
be
common
to
us
all
,
he
shrink
involuntarily
into
a
doorway
,
that
she
may
not
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
smile
at
his
own
weakness
;
say
"
God
bless
them
!
"
and
walk
away
with
a
light
step
.
   
<EOS>
Smike
be
anxiously
expect
him
when
he
reach
his
old
lodging
,
and
so
be
Newman
,
who
have
expend
a
day
's
income
in
a
can
of
rum
and
milk
to
prepare
them
for
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
tie
up
the
luggage
,
Smike
shoulder
it
,
and
away
they
go
,
with
Newman
Noggs
in
company
;
for
he
have
insist
on
walk
as
far
as
he
could
with
them
,
overnight
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
which
way
?
"
ask
Newman
,
wistfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
Kingston
first
,
"
reply
Nicholas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
where
afterwards
?
"
ask
Newman
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
will
not
you
tell
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
because
I
scarcely
know
myself
,
good
friend
,
"
rejoin
Nicholas
,
lay
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
;
"
and
if
I
do
,
I
have
neither
plan
nor
prospect
yet
,
and
may
shift
my
quarter
a
hundred
time
before
you
could
possibly
communicate
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
you
have
some
deep
scheme
in
your
head
,
"
say
Newman
,
doubtfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
so
deep
,
"
reply
his
young
friend
,
"
that
even
I
can
not
fathom
it
.
<EOS>
whatever
I
resolve
upon
,
depend
upon
it
I
will
write
you
soon
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
forget
?
"
say
Newman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
very
likely
to
,
"
rejoin
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
so
many
friend
that
I
shall
grow
confused
among
the
number
,
and
forget
my
good
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
occupy
in
such
discourse
,
they
walk
on
for
a
couple
of
hour
,
as
they
may
have
do
for
a
couple
of
day
if
Nicholas
have
not
sit
himself
down
on
a
stone
by
the
wayside
,
and
resolutely
declare
his
intention
of
not
move
another
step
until
Newman
Noggs
turn
back
.
<EOS>
have
plead
ineffectually
first
for
another
half
-
mile
,
and
afterwards
for
another
quarter
,
Newman
be
fain
to
comply
,
and
to
shape
his
course
towards
Golden
Square
,
after
interchange
many
hearty
and
affectionate
farewell
,
and
many
time
turn
back
to
wave
his
hat
to
the
two
wayfarer
when
they
have
become
mere
speck
in
the
distance
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
listen
to
me
,
Smike
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
as
they
trudge
with
stout
heart
onwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
bind
for
Portsmouth
.
"
   
<EOS>
Smike
nod
his
head
and
smile
,
but
express
no
other
emotion
;
for
whether
they
have
be
bind
for
Portsmouth
or
Port
Royal
would
have
be
alike
to
him
,
so
they
have
be
bind
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
much
of
these
matter
,
"
resume
Nicholas
;
"
but
Portsmouth
be
a
seaport
town
,
and
if
no
other
employment
be
to
be
obtain
,
I
should
think
we
may
get
on
board
some
ship
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
young
and
active
,
and
could
be
useful
in
many
way
.
 
<EOS>
so
could
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
reply
Smike
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
I
be
at
that
---
you
know
where
I
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
I
know
,
"

Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
name
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
when
I
be
there
,
"
resume
Smike
;
his
eye
sparkle
at
the
prospect
of
display
his
ability
;
"
I
could
milk
a
cow
,
and
groom
a
horse
,
with
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
ha
!
"
say
Nicholas
,
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
they
do
not
keep
many
animal
of
either
kind
on
board
ship
,
Smike
,
and
even
when
they
have
horse
,
that
they
be
not
very
particular
about
rub
them
down
;
still
you
can
learn
to
do
something
else

you
know

there
be

will

there
be
a
way

I
be

up
again

God
know
you
be
,

rejoin
Nicholas

if
you
fail
,
it
shall
go
hard

I
will
do
enough
for
us
both
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
we
go
all
the
way
today
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Smike
,
after
a
short
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
would
be
too
severe
a
trial
,
even
for
your
willing
leg

Nicholas
,
with
a
good
-
humoured
smile

<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
Godalming
be
some
thirty
and
odd
mile
from
London

as
I
find
from
a
map
I
borrow
---
and
I
purpose
to
rest
there
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
push
on
again
tomorrow
,
for
we
be
not
rich
enough
to
loiter

me
relieve
you

come

up

Nicholas

do
something

day

of
way

you

<EOS>
"
You
be
a
foolish
fellow

it

ask
you
a
question

I

once

all

why
do
you

once

"
<EOS>
ask
Nicholas

turn
quickly
upon
him
as
though
the
answer
in
some
way
help
out
the
purport
of
his
question

<EOS>
"
because
I
could
remember

that

very
,
very
long
ago

at

it
seem
so

<EOS>
I
be
always
confused

giddy
<EOS>
at
that
place
you
take
me
from

what

I

hard

rain
fall
heavily

It

it
more

I
turn
cold

the
youth

with
a
melancholy
look

a
room

I
remember
I
sleep
in
a
room

a
large
lonesome
room
at
the
top
of
a
house

where
there
be
a
trap

door
in
the
ceiling

I
have
cover
my
head

clothe
often

not

it
frighten
me
:
a
young
child
with
no
one
near
at
night

I
use
to
wonder
what
be
on
the
other
side

there
be
a
clock
too

an
old
clock

in

corner

I

thing

but
there
be
the
room
just
as
it
use
to
be
;
that
never
change
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
let
me
take
the
bundle
now
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Nicholas
,
abruptly
change
the
theme
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Smike
,
"
no
.
 
<EOS>
come
,
let
us
walk
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
quicken
his
pace
as
he
say
this
,
apparently
under
the
impression
that
they
have
be
stand
still
during
the
whole
of
the
previous
dialogue
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
mark
him
closely
,
and
every
word
of
this
conversation
remain
upon
his
memory
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
,
by
this
time
,
within
an
hour
of
noon
,
and
although
a
dense
vapour
still
envelop
the
city
they
have
leave
,
as
if
the
very
breath
of
its
busy
people
hang
over
their
scheme
of
gain
and
profit
,
and
find
great
attraction
there
than
in
the
quiet
region
above
,
in
the
open
country
it
be
clear
and
fair
.
 
<EOS>
occasionally
,
in
some
low
spot
they
come
upon
patch
of
mist
which
the
sun
have
not
yet
drive
from
their
stronghold
;
but
these
be
soon
pass
,
and
as
they
labour
up
the
hill
beyond
,
it
be
pleasant
to
look
down
,
and
see
how
the
sluggish
mass
roll
heavily
off
,
before
the
cheer
influence
of
day
.
 
<EOS>
a
broad
,
fine
,
honest
sun
light
up
the
green
pasture
and
dimpled
water
with
the
semblance
of
summer
,
while
it
leave
the
traveller
all
the
invigorate
freshness
of
that
early
time
of
year
.
 
<EOS>
the
ground
seem
elastic
under
their
foot
;
the
sheep
-
bell
be
music
to
their
ear
;
and
exhilarate
by
exercise
,
and
stimulate
by
hope
,
they
push
onward
with
the
strength
of
lion
.
   
<EOS>
the
day
wear
on
,
and
all
these
bright
colour
subside
,
and
assume
a
quieter
tint
,
like
young
hope
soften
down
by
time
,
or
youthful
feature
by
degree
resolve
into
the
calm
and
serenity
of
age
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
scarcely
less
beautiful
in
their
slow
decline
,
than
they
have
be
in
their
prime
;
for
nature
give
to
every
time
and
season
some
beauty
of
its
own
;
and
from
morning
to
night
,
as
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
,
be
but
a
succession
of
change
so
gentle
and
easy
,
that
we
can
scarcely
mark
their
progress
.
   
<EOS>
to
godalme
<EOS>
they
come
at
last
,
and
here
they
bargain
for
two
humble
bed
,
and
sleep
soundly
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
they
be
astir
:
though
not
quite
so
early
as
the
sun
:
and
again
afoot
;
if
not
with
all
the
freshness
of
yesterday
,
still
,
with
enough
of
hope
and
spirit
to
bear
them
cheerily
on
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
hard
day
's
journey
than
yesterday
's
,
for
there
be
long
and
weary
hill
to
climb
;
and
in
journey
,
as
in
life
,
it
be
a
great
deal
easy
to
go
down
hill
than
up
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
they
keep
on
,
with
unabated
perseverance
,
and
the
hill
have
not
yet
lift
its
face
to
heaven
that
perseverance
will
not
gain
the
summit
of
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
They
walk
upon
the
rim
of
the
Devil
's
Punch
Bowl
;
and
Smike
listen
with
greedy
interest
as
Nicholas
read
the
inscription
upon
the
stone
which
,
rear
upon
that
wild
spot
,
tell
of
a
murder
commit
there
by
night
.
 
<EOS>
the
grass
on
which
they
stand
,
have
once
be
dye
with
gore
;
and
the
blood
of
the
murder
man
have
run
down
,
drop
by
drop
,
into
the
hollow
which
give
the
place
its
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
Devil

think
Nicholas
,
as
he
look
into
the
void
,
"
never
hold
fitter
liquor
than
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
Onward
they
keep
,
with
steady
purpose
,
and
enter
at
length
upon
a
wide
and
spacious
tract
of
down
,
with
every
variety
of
little
hill
and
plain
to
change
their
verdant
surface
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
there
shoot
up
,
almost
perpendicularly
,
into
the
sky
,
a
height
<EOS>
so
steep
,
as
to
be
hardly
accessible
to
any
but
the
sheep
and
goat
that
feed
upon
its
side
,
and
there
,
stand
a
mound
of
green
,
slope
and
taper
off
so
delicately
,
and
merge
so
gently
into
the
level
ground
,
that
you
could
scarce
define
its
limit
.
 
<EOS>
Hills
swell
above
each
other
;
and
undulation
shapely
and
uncouth
,
smooth
and
rugged
,
graceful
and
grotesque
,
throw
negligently
side
by
side
,
bound
the
view
in
each
direction
;
while
frequently
,
with
unexpected
noise
,
there
uprose
from
the
ground
a
flight
of
crow
,
who
,
cawing
and
wheeling
round
the
near
hill
,
as
if
uncertain
of
their
course
,
suddenly
poise
themselves
upon
the
wing
and
skim
down
the
long
vista
of
some
open
valley
,
with
the
speed
of
light
itself
.
   
<EOS>
by
degree
,
the
prospect
recede
more
and
more
on
either
hand
,
and
as
they
have
be
shut
out
from
rich
and
extensive
scenery
,
so
they
emerge
once
again
upon
the
open
country
.
 
<EOS>
the
knowledge
that
they
be
draw
near
their
place
of
destination
,
give
them
fresh
courage
to
proceed
;
but
the
way
have
be
difficult
,
and
they
have
loiter
on
the
road
,
and
Smike
be
tired
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
twilight
have
already
close
in
,
when
they
turn
off
the
path
to
the
door
of
a
roadside
inn
,
yet
twelve
mile
short
of
Portsmouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
twelve

Nicholas

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
very

he
pull
up

put
his

into

and
,
take
a
step
or
two
outside
the
door

look
down
the
dark
road

an
assumption
of
great
indifference

<EOS>
a
glance
at
the
toil

of
Smike
determine
Nicholas
,
so
without
any
further
consideration
he
make
up
his
mind
to
stay
where
he
be

<EOS>
the
landlord
lead
them
into
the
kitchen
,
and
as
there
be
a
good
fire
he
remark
that
it
be
very
cold
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
have
happen
to
be
a

he
would
have
observe

very
warm

<EOS>
"
what
can
you
give
us
for
supper
?
<EOS>

be
Nicholas

natural
question

<EOS>
"
why

what
would
you
like
?
<EOS>
"
be
the
landlord
be
no

natural
answer

<EOS>
Nicholas
suggest
cold
meat
,
but
there
be
no
cold
meat
---
poached
egg
,
but
there

mutton
chop

there
be
not

"
then

I

there

there

It

corner

table

who
emphatically

them
to
strike
a
little
more
fire
out

bring

Mr

deference

<EOS>
"
this

the
young
gentleman

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Vincent
Crummles
receive
Nicholas
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
,
something
between
the
courtesy
of
a
roman
emperor
and
the
nod
of
a
pot
companion
;
and
bade
the
landlord
shut
the
door
and
begone
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
picture
,
"
say
Mr
Crummles
,
motion
Nicholas
not
to
advance
and
spoil
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
little
'
un
have
him
;
if
the
big
'
un
do
not
knock
under
,
in
three
second
,
he
be
a
dead
man
.
 
<EOS>
do
that
again
,
boy
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
two
combatant
go
to
work
afresh
,
and
chop
away
until
the
sword
emit
a
shower
of
spark
:
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
Mr
Crummles
,
who
appear
to
consider
this
a
very
great
point
indeed
.
<EOS>
the
engagement
commence
with
about
two
hundred
chop
administer
by
the
short
sailor
and
the
tall
sailor
alternately
,
without
produce
any
particular
result
,
until
the
short
sailor
be
chop
down
on
one
knee
;
but
this
be
nothing
to
him
,
for
he
work
himself
about
on
the
one
knee
with
the
assistance
of
his
left
hand
,
and
fight
most
desperately
until
the
tall
sailor
chop
his
sword
out
of
his
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
the
inference
be
,
that
the
short
sailor
,
reduce
to
this
extremity
,
would
give
in
at
once
and
cry
quarter
,
but
,
instead
of
that
,
he
all
of
a
sudden
draw
a
large
pistol
from
his
belt
and
present
it
at
the
face
of
the
tall
sailor
,
who
be
so
overcome
at
this
(
not
expect
it
)
that
he
let
the
short
sailor
pick
up
his
sword
and
begin
again
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
the
chopping
recommence
,
and
a
variety
of
fancy
chop
be
administer
on
both
side
;
such
as
chop
deal
with
the
left
hand
,
and
under
the
leg
,
and
over
the
right
shoulder
,
and
over
the
left
;
and
when
the
short
sailor
make
a
vigorous
cut
at
the
tall
sailor
's
leg
,
which
would
have
shave
them
clean
off
if
it
have
take
effect
,
the
tall
sailor
jump
over
the
short
sailor
's
sword
,
wherefore
to
balance
the
matter
,
and
make
it
all
fair
,
the
tall
sailor
administer
the
same
cut
,
and
the
short
sailor
jump
over
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
,
there
be
a
good
deal
of
dodge
about
,
and
hitch
up
of
the
inexpressible
in
the
absence
of
brace
,
and
then
the
short
sailor
(
who
be
the
moral
character
evidently
,
for
he
always
have
the
good
of
it
)
make
a
violent
demonstration
and
close
with
the
tall
sailor
,
who
,
after
a
few
unavaile
struggle
,
go
down
,
and
expire
in
great
torture
as
the
short
sailor
put
his
foot
upon
his
breast
,
and
bore
a
hole
in
him
through
and
through
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
will

address
these

the

salute
Nicholas

who
then
observe
that
the
face
of
Mr
Crummles
be
quite
proportionate
in
size
to
his
body
;
that
he
have
a
very
full
under

lip
,
a
hoarse
voice
,
as
though
he
be
in
the
habit
of
shout
very
much
,
and
very
short
black
hair
,
shave
off
nearly
to
the
crown
of
his
head
---
to
admit
(
as
he
afterwards
learn
)
of
his
more
easily
wear
character
wig
of
any
shape

<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think

inquire
Mr

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
good

Nicholas

"
You

such

often

I

Mr
Crummles

Nicholas
assented

observe
that
if
they

a
little
well
match

"
match

cry
Mr
Crummles

<EOS>
"
I
mean

Nicholas

explain
himself

<EOS>
"
size

"
<EOS>
repeat
Mr
Crummles
;
"
why
,
it
be
the
essence
of
the
combat
that
there
should
be
a
foot
or
two
between
them

<EOS>
how
be
you
to
get
up
the
sympathy
of
the
audience
in
a
legitimate
manner
,
if
there
be
not
a
little

your

<EOS>
Nicholas
promise
to
do
so
,
if
he
could
,
and
draw
a
chair
near
the
fire

fall
into
conversation
with
the
manager
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
talkative
and
communicative
,
stimulate
perhaps
,
not
only
by
his
natural
disposition
,
but
by
the
spirit
and
water
he
sip
very
plentifully
,
or
the
snuff
he
take
in
large
quantity
from
a
piece
of
whitey
-
brown
paper
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
open
his
affair
without
the
small
reserve
,
and
descant
at
some
length
upon
the
merit
of
his
company
,
and
the
acquirement
of
his
family
;
of
both
of
which
,
the
two
broad

sword
boy
form
an
honourable
portion
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
a
gathering
,
it
seem
,
of
the
different
lady
and
gentleman
at
Portsmouth
on
the
morrow
,
whither
the
father
and
son
be
proceed
(
not
for
the
regular
season
,
but
in
the
course
of
a
wander
speculation
)
,
after
fulfil
an
engagement
at
Guildford
with
the
great
applause

do
you

the

who
seem

the

degree
of
confidence

<EOS>
Mr
Vincent
Crummles
give
a
short
dry
cough
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
if
you
will
not
be
communicative

you

and
take
so
many
pinche
of

from
the
piece

one

Nicholas

wonder

<EOS>
while

Mr

from

He

asleep

excuse
my

so

the

lean
over
to
Nicholas

sink
his
voice
,
"
but
what
a
capital
countenance
your
friend
have
get
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
say
Nicholas
,
with
a
half
-
smile
,
"
I
wish
it
be
a
little
more
plump

and
less
haggard
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
plump

exclaim
the

quite
horrified
,
"
you
would
spoil
it
for

<EOS>
"
do
you

<EOS>
"
think
so

sir

<EOS>
why
,
as
he
be
now
,
"
say
the
manager
,
strike
his
knee
emphatically
;
"
without
a
pad
upon
his
body
,
and
hardly
a
touch
of
paint
upon
his
face
,
he
would
make
such
an
actor
for
the
starve
business
as
be
never
see
in
this
country
.
 
<EOS>
only
let
him
be
tolerably
well
up
in
the
Apothecary
in
Romeo
and
Juliet
,
with
the
slight
possible
dab
of
red
on
the
tip
of
his
nose
,
and
he
would
be
certain
of
three
round
the
moment
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
practicable
door
in
the
front
groove
O*P.

"
You
view
him
with

professional
eye

Nicholas

laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
well
I
may
,
"
rejoin
the
manager
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
a
young
fellow
so
regularly
cut
out
for
that
line
,
since
I
have

I
play
the
heavy
child

I

eighteen
month
old

"
   
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
beef
-
steak
pudding
,
which
come
in
simultaneously
with
the
junior
Vincent
Crummleses
,
turn
the
conversation
to
other
matter
,
and
indeed
,
for
a
time
,
stop
it
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
these
two
young
gentleman
wield
their
knife
and
fork
with
scarcely
less
address
than
their
broad
-
sword
,
and
as
the
whole
party
be
quite
as
sharp
set
as
either
class
of
weapon
,
there
be
no
time
for
talk
until
the
supper
have
be
dispose
of
.
   
<EOS>
the
Master
Crummleses
have
no
sooner
swallow
the
last
procurable
morsel
of
food
,
than
they
evince
,
by
various
half
-
suppress
yawn
and
stretching
of
their
limb
,
an
obvious
inclination
to
retire
for
the
night
,
which
Smike
have
betray
still
more
strongly
:
<EOS>
he
have
,
in
the
course
of
the
meal
,
fall
asleep
several
time
while
in
the
very
act
of
eating
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
therefore
propose
that
they
should
break
up
at
once
,
but
the
manager
would
by
no
means
hear
of
it
;
vow
that
he
have
promise
himself
the
pleasure
of
invite
his
new
acquaintance
to
share
a
bowl
of
punch
,
and
that
if
he
decline
,
he
should
deem
it
very
unhandsome
behaviour
.
   
<EOS>
"
let
them
go
,
"
say
Mr
Vincent
Crummles
,
"
and
we
will
have
it
snugly
and
cosily
together
by
the
fire
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
be
not
much
dispose
to
sleep
---
be
in
truth
too
anxious
---
so
,
after
a
little
demur
,
he
accept
the
offer
,
and
have
exchange
a
shake
of
the
hand
with
the
young
Crummleses
,
and
the
manager
have
on
his
part
bestow
a
most
affectionate
benediction
on
Smike
,
he
sit
himself
down
opposite
to
that
gentleman
by
the
fireside
to
assist
in
empty
the
bowl
,
which
soon
afterwards
appear
,
steam
in
a
manner
which
be
quite
exhilarating
to
behold
,
and
send
forth
a
most
grateful
and
inviting
fragrance
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
despite
the
punch
and
the
manager
,
who
tell
a
variety
of
story
,
and
smoke
tobacco
from
a
pipe
,
and
inhale
it
in
the
shape
of
snuff
,
with
a
most
astonishing
power
,
Nicholas
be
absent
and
dispirit
.
 
<EOS>
His
thought
be
in
his
old
home
,
and
when
they
revert
to
his
present
condition
,
the
uncertainty
of
the
morrow
cast
a
gloom
upon
him
,
which
his
utmost
effort
be
unable
to
dispel
.
 
<EOS>
His
attention
wander
;
although
he
hear
the
manager
's
voice
,
he
be
deaf
to
what
he
say
;
and
when
Mr
Vincent
Crummles
conclude
the
history
of
some
long
adventure
with
a
loud
laugh
,
and
an
inquiry
what
Nicholas
would
have
do
under
the
same
circumstance
,
he
be
oblige
to
make
the
good
apology
in
his
power
,
and
to
confess
his
entire
ignorance
of
all
he
have
be
talk
about
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
so
I
see
,
"
observe
Mr
Crummles
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
uneasy
in
your
mind

what
be
the
matter

"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
could
not
refrain
from
smile
at
the
abruptness
of
the
question
;
but
,
think
it
scarcely
worth
while
to
parry
it
,
own
that
he
be
under
some
apprehension
lest
he
may
not
succeed
in
the
object
which
have
bring
him
to
that
part
of
the
country

what
be
that
?

ask
the

something
to
do

will
keep
me

it

<EOS>
"
what
be
to

to
do
at
Portsmouth
more

ask
Mr
Vincent
Crummles
,
melt
the
sealing
-
wax
on
the
stem
of
his
pipe
in
the
candle
,
and
roll
it
out
afresh
with
his
little
finger

<EOS>
"
there
be
many

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
I
shall
try
for

it
alight

Nicholas

his

avoid
him
in
six
twirl

down

at

end

the
last
one

point

her
toe

<EOS>
this
seem
to
make
some
impression
upon
the
savage

for
,
after
a
little
more
ferocity

chasing
of
the
maiden
into
corner

he
begin

impulse

hit
himself
severe
thump
in
the
chest

to
exhibit
other
indication

be
desperately
in
love

which
be
rather
a
prosy
proceeding

be
very
likely
the
cause

the

fall
asleep
;
whether
it
be

asleep

she
do
fall
,
sound
as
a
church

on
a
sloping
bank

the
savage
perceive
it
,
leant
his
left
ear
on
his
left
hand
,

nod
sideway
,
to
intimate
to
all
whom
it
may
concern
that

asleep

off

wake
up

rub
her
eye
,
get
off
the
bank

have
a
dance
all
alone
too
---
such
a
dance
that
the
savage
look
on
in
ecstasy
all
the
while
,
and
when
it
be
do
,
pluck
from
a
neighbouring
tree
some
botanical
curiosity
,
resemble
a
small
pickle
cabbage
,
and
offer
it
to
the
maiden
,
who
at
first
would
not
have
it
,
but
on
the
savage
shed
tear
relent
.

then
the
savage
jump
for
joy
;
then
the
maiden
jump
for
rapture
at
the
sweet
smell
of
the
pickle
cabbage

then
the
savage
and
the
maiden
dance
violently
together
,
and
,
finally
,
the
savage
drop
down
on
one
knee
,
and
the
maiden
stand
on
one
leg
upon
his
other
knee
;
thus
conclude
the
ballet
,
and
leave
the
spectator
in
a
state
of
pleasing
uncertainty

whether

Mr

"
it
be
extraordinary

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
;
for
the
infant
phenomenon
,
though
of
short
stature
,
have
a
comparatively
aged
countenance
,
and
have
moreover
be
precisely
the
same
age
---
not
perhaps
to
the
full
extent
of
the
memory
of
the
old
inhabitant
,
but
certainly
for
five
good
year
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
be
keep
up
late
every
night
,
and
put
upon
an
unlimited
allowance
of
gin
-
and
-
water
from
infancy
,
to
prevent
her
grow
tall
,
and
perhaps
this
system
of
training
have
produce
in
the
infant
phenomenon
these
additional
phenomenon

I
tell
you

Nicholas

refrain

possibly
bear
it

be
put
a
stop
to
by
another
jerk

the
bell

which

be
the
signal
to
begin
in

set
the
orchestra
play
a
variety

<EOS>
if
Nicholas
have
be
astonish
at
the
alteration

when

from

he
behold
Miss

the
glory
of

he

scarcely
contain
his
admiration

which
testify
itself
in
great
applause

and
the
close
possible
attention
to
the
business
of
the
scene

<EOS>
the
plot
be
most
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
It
belong
to
no
particular
age
,
people
,
or
country
,
and
be
perhaps
the
more
delightful
on
that
account
,
as
nobody
's
previous
information
could
afford
the
remote
glimmering
of
what
would
ever
come
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
an
outlaw
have
be
very
successful
in
do
something
somewhere
,
and
come
home
,
in
triumph
,
to
the
sound
of
shout
and
fiddle
,
to
greet
his
wife
---
a
lady
of
masculine
mind
,
who
talk
a
good
deal
about
her
father
's
bone
,
which
it
seem
be
unburie
,
though
whether
from
a
peculiar
taste
on
the
part
of
the
old
gentleman
himself
,
or
the
reprehensible
neglect
of
his
relation
,
do
not
appear
.
 
<EOS>
this
outlaw
's
wife
be
,
somehow
or
other
,
mix
up
with
a
patriarch
,
live
in
a
castle
a
long
way
off
,
and
this
patriarch
be
the
father
of
several
of
the
character
,
but
he
do
not
exactly
know
which
,
and
be
uncertain
whether
he
have
bring
up
the
right
one
in
his
castle
,
or
the
wrong
one
;
he
rather
incline
to
the
latter
opinion
,
and
,
be
uneasy
,
relieve
his
mind
with
a
banquet
,
during
which
solemnity
somebody
in
a
cloak
say
"
beware
!
"
<EOS>
which
somebody
be
know
by
nobody
(
except
the
audience
)
to
be
the
outlaw
himself
,
who
have
come
there
,
for
reason
unexplaine
,
but
possibly
with
an
eye
to
the
spoon
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
agreeable
little
surprise
in
the
way
of
certain
love
passage
between
the
desponding
captive
and
Miss
Snevellicci
,
and
the
comic
fighting
-
man
and
Miss
Bravassa
;
besides
which
,
Mr
Lenville
have
several
very
tragic
scene
in
the
dark
,
while
on
throat
-
cut
expedition
,
which
be
all
baffle
by
the
skill
and
bravery
of
the
comic
fighting
-
man
(
who
overhear
whatever
be
say
all
through
the
piece
)
and
the
intrepidity
of
Miss
Snevellicci
,
who
adopt
tight
,
and
therein
repair
to
the
prison
of
her
captive
lover
,
with
a
small
basket
of
refreshment
and
a
dark
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
it
come
out
that
the
patriarch
be
the
man
who
have
treat
the
bone
of
the
outlaw
's
father
-
in
-
law
with
so
much
disrespect
,
for
which
cause
and
reason
the
outlaw
's
wife
repair
to
his
castle
to
kill
him
,
and
so
get
into
a
dark
room
,
where
,
after
a
good
deal
of
grope
in
the
dark
,
everybody
get
hold
of
everybody
else
,
and
take
them
for
somebody
besides
,
which
occasion
a
vast
quantity
of
confusion
,
with
some
pistolling
,
loss
of
life
,
and
torchlight
;
after
which
,
the
patriarch
come
forward
,
and
observe
,
with
a
know
look
,
that
he
know
all
about
his
child
now
,
and
would
tell
them
when
they
get
inside
,
say
that
there
could
not
be
a
more
appropriate
occasion
for
marry
the
young
people
than
that
;
and
therefore
he
join
their
hand
,
with
the
full
consent
of
the
indefatigable
page
,
who
(
be
the
only
other
person
survive
)
point
with
his
cap
into
the
cloud
,
and
his
right
hand
to
the
ground
;
thereby
invoke
a
blessing
and
give
the
cue
for
the
curtain
to
come
down
,
which
it
do
,
amidst
general
applause
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
almost
immediately
afterwards

the
good

to
laugh
violently

<EOS>
Nicholas
leave
them
to
enjoy
their
mirth
together
,
and
walk
to
his
lodging
;
wonder
very
much
what
mystery
connect
with
Miss
Petowker
could
provoke
such
merriment
,
and
ponder
still
more
on
the
extreme
surprise
with
which
that
lady
would
regard
his
sudden
enlistment
in
a
profession
of
which
she
be
such
a
distinguished
and
brilliant
ornament
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
in
this
latter
respect
he
be
mistaken
;
for
---
whether
Mr
Vincent
Crummles
have
pave
the
way
,
or
Miss
Petowker
have
some
special
reason
for
treat
him
with
even
more
than
her
usual
amiability
---
<EOS>
their
meeting
at
the
theatre
next
day
be
more
like
that
of
two
dear
friend
who
have
be
inseparable
from
infancy
,
than
a
recognition
pass
between
a
lady
and
gentleman
who
have
only
meet
some
half
-
dozen
time
,
and
then
by
mere
chance
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
Miss
Petowker
even
whisper
that
she
have
wholly
drop
the
Kenwigses
in
her
conversation
with
the
manager
's
family
,
and
have
represent
herself
as
have
encounter
Mr
Johnson
in
the
very
first
and
most
fashionable
circle
;
and
on
Nicholas
receive
this
intelligence
with
unfeigned
surprise
,
she
add
,
with
a
sweet
glance
,
that
she
have
a
claim
on
his
good
nature
now
,
and
may
tax
it
before
long
.
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
have
the
honour
of
play
in
a
slight
piece
with
Miss
Petowker
that
night
,
and
could
not
but
observe
that
the
warmth
of
her
reception
be
mainly
attributable
to
a
most
persevere
umbrella
in
the
upper
box
;
he
see
,
too
,
that
the
enchanting
actress
cast
many
sweet
look
towards
the
quarter
whence
these
sound
proceeded
;
and
that
every
time
she
do
so
,
the
umbrella
break
out
afresh
.
<EOS>
once
,
he
think
that
a
peculiarly
shape
hat
in
the
same
corner
be
not
wholly
unknown
to
him
;
but
,
be
occupy
with
his
share
of
the
stage
business
,
he
bestow
no
great
attention
upon
this
circumstance
,
and
it
have
quite
vanish
from
his
memory
by
the
time
he
reach
home
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
just
sit
down
to
supper
with
Smike
,
when
one
of
the
people
of
the
house
come
outside
the
door
,
and
announce
that
a
gentleman
below
stair
wish
to
speak
to
Mr
Johnson
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
if
he
do
,
you
must
tell
him
to
come
up
;
that
be
all
I
know
,
"
reply
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
one
of
our
hungry
brother

I
suppose
,
Smike

"
   
<EOS>
His
fellow

lodger
look
at
the
cold
meat
in
silent
calculation
of
the
quantity
that
would
be
leave
for
dinner
next
day

and
put
back
a
slice
he
have
cut
for
himself
,
in
order
that
the
visitor

encroachment
may
be
less
formidable

"
It

Sir

manifest
an
indifference

whether
he

not

that
be
a

mine

so
much

<EOS>
"
confound
it

"
<EOS>
reason
the

,
"
you
be
thick
enough

<EOS>
I
could
hardly
get
in

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
enough

well
enough
for

"
reply
Sir
Mulberry
;
"
but
not
worth
the
trouble
of
be
agreeable
to
again

<EOS>
if
you
seriously
want
to
follow
up
the
niece
,
tell
the
uncle
that
you
must
know
where
she
live

how
she
live
,

with
whom
,

you
be
no

a
customer

his

<EOS>
He
will
tell
you
fast
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
say
this
before
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Lord
Verisopht
,
"
instead
of
let
me
go
on
burn
,
consume
,
drag
out
a
miserable
existence
for
an
a

age
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
it
,
in
the
first
place
,
"
answer
Sir
Mulberry
carelessly
;
"
and
in
the
second
,
I
do
not
believe
you
be
so
very
much
in
earnest
.
"
   
<EOS>
now
,
the
truth
be
,
that
in
the
interval
which
have
elapse
since
the
dinner
at
Ralph
Nickleby
's
,
Sir
Mulberry
Hawk
have
be
furtively
try
by
every
mean
in
his
power
to
discover
whence
Kate
have
so
suddenly
appear
,
and
whither
she
have
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
unassiste
by
Ralph
,
however
,
with
whom
he
have
hold
no
communication
since
their
angry
parting
on
that
occasion
,
all
his
effort
be
wholly
unavaile
,
and
he
have
therefore
arrive
at
the
determination
of
communicate
to
the
young
lord
the
substance
of
the
admission
he
have
glean
from
that
worthy
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
he
be
impel
by
various
consideration
;
among
which
the
certainty
of
know
whatever
the
weak
young
man
know
be
decidedly
not
the
least
,
as
the
desire
of
encounter
the
usurer
's
niece
again
,
and
use
his
utmost
art
to
reduce
her
pride
,
and
revenge
himself
for
her
contempt
,
be
uppermost
in
his
thought
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
politic
course
of
proceeding
,
and
one
which
could
not
fail
to
redound
to
his
advantage
in
every
point
of
view
,
since
the
very
circumstance
of
his
have
extort
from
Ralph
Nickleby
his
real
design
in
introduce
his
niece
to
such
society
,
couple
with
his
extreme
disinterestedness
in
communicate
it
so
freely
to
his
friend
,
could
not
but
advance
his
interest
in
that
quarter
,
and
greatly
facilitate
the
passage
of
coin
(
pretty
frequent
and
speedy
already
)
from
the
pocket
of
Lord
Frederick
Verisopht
to
those
of
Sir
Mulberry
Hawk
.
   
<EOS>
thus
reason
Sir
Mulberry
,
and
in
pursuance
of
this
reasoning
he
and
his
friend
soon
afterwards
repair
to
Ralph
Nickleby
's
,
there
to
execute
a
plan
of
operation
concert
by
Sir
Mulberry
himself
,
avowedly
to
promote
his
friend
's
object
,
and
really
to
attain
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
They
find
Ralph
at
home
,
and
alone
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
lead
them
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
the
recollection
of
the
scene
which
have
take
place
there
seem
to
occur
to
him
,
for
he
cast
a
curious
look
at
Sir
Mulberry
,
who
bestow
upon
it
no
other
acknowledgment
than
a
careless
smile
.
   
<EOS>
They
have
a
short
conference
upon
some
money
matter
then
in
progress
,
which
be
scarcely
dispose
of
when
the
lordly
dupe
(
in
pursuance
of
his
friend
's
instruction
)
request
with
some
embarrassment
to
speak
to
Ralph
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
alone
,
eh
?
"
cry
Sir
Mulberry
,
affect
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
walk
into
the
next
room
here
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
keep
me
long
,
that
be
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
so
say
,
Sir
Mulberry
take
up
his
hat
,
and
hum
a
fragment
of
a
song
disappear
through
the
door
of
communication
between
the
two
drawing
-
room
,
and
close
it
after
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
now

say
Ralph
,
"
what
be
it

throw
himself
along
the
sofa
on
which
he
have
be
previously

so
as
to
bring
his
lip
near
to
the
old
man
's
ear
,
"
what
a
pretty
creature
your
niece
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
she

my
lord

"
reply
Ralph
.
 
<EOS>
"
maybe

I
do
not
trouble
my
head
with
such
matter

<EOS>
"
You

the

not

<EOS>
yes

I
believe

so

Ralph

<EOS>

indeed

I
know
she
be

<EOS>
if
I
do
not

you
be

your
taste

my

undeniable

"
   
<EOS>
nobody
but
the
young
man
to
whom
these
word
be
address
could
have
be
deaf
to
the
sneer
tone
in
which
they
be
speak

blind
to
the
look
of
contempt
by
which
they
be
accompany

but
Lord
Frederick

be
both

take
them
to
be
complimentary

"

well

he

p'raps
you

observe
that
from
what
he
hear
of

they
appear
very
ambitious

distinguish
acquaintance

that

Hackney

up

pen

at

I
think
they
write
them

though
Kate
be
never
quite
certain
about
that
,
because
she
do
not
know
the
handwriting
of
her
again
;
but
anyway
,
I
know
it
be
a
circular
which
they
all
copy
,
and
of
course
it
be
a
very
gratifying
thing
---
very
gratifying

"
   
<EOS>
with
similar
recollection
Mrs
Nickleby
beguile
the
tediousness
of
the
way
,
until
they
reach
the
omnibus
,
which
the
extreme
politeness
of
her
new
friend
would
not
allow
them
to
leave
until
it
actually
start
,
when
they
take
their
hat
,
as
Mrs
Nickleby
solemnly
assure
her
hearer
on
many
subsequent
occasion
,
"
completely
off
,
"
and
kiss
their
straw
-
colour
kid
glove
till
they
be
no
longer
visible
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Nickleby
leant
back
in
the
furth
corner
of
the
conveyance
,
and
,
close
her
eye
,
resign
herself
to
a
host
of
most
pleasing
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
Kate
have
never
say
a
word
about
have
meet
either
of
these
gentleman
;
"
that
,
"
she
think
,
"
argue
that
she
be
strongly
prepossess
in
favour
of
one
of
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
the
question
arise
,
which
one
could
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
lord
be
the
young
,
and
his
title
be
certainly
the
grand
;
still
Kate
be
not
the
girl
to
be
sway
by
such
consideration
as
these
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
put
any
constraint
upon
her
inclination
,
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
to
herself
;
"
but
upon
my
word
I
think
there
be
no
comparison
between
his
lordship
and
Sir
Mulberry
<EOS>
---
Sir
Mulberry
be
such
an
attentive
gentlemanly
creature
,
so
much
manner
,
such
a
fine
man
,
and
have
so
much
to
say
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
be
Sir
Mulberry
<EOS>
---
I
think
it
must
be
Sir
Mulberry
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
her
thought
fly
back
to
her
old
prediction
,
and
the
number
of
time
she
have
say
,
that
Kate
with
no
fortune
would
marry
better
than
other
people
's
daughter
with
thousand
;
and
,
as
she
picture
with
the
brightness
of
a
mother
's
fancy
all
the
beauty
and
grace
of
the
poor
girl
who
have
struggle
so
cheerfully
with
her
new
life
of
hardship
and
trial
,
her
heart
grow
too
full
,

the
tear
trickle
down
her
face

<EOS>
meanwhile

Ralph

<EOS>
still
,
there
have
somehow
steal
upon
him
from
time
to
time
a
thought
of
his
niece
which
be
tinge
with
compassion

pity
;
break
through
the
dull
cloud

indifference
which
darken
man

in

case

the
faint
gleam
of
light

a
most
feeble
and
sickly
ray
at
the
good
of

but
there

be

and
it
show
the
poor

Poor

lively
recollection

poor

act
upon

reject
the

content
herself
with
hold
out
sundry
vague

mysterious

punctual

up

<EOS>
It
be
quite
exhilarating

hear
the
clash

bustle

which
he
bang
the
door

jump
up
behind

Mrs

be
in

perfectly
unconscious

at

with
a

accidentally
stumble

to
the
great
terror

conjecture

fortunately

however

Mr

confine
himself
to
mere
verbal
smifligation

and
they
reach
their
box
with
no
more
serious
interruption
by
the
way
,
than
a
desire
on

part
of
the

widely
different

bring
together
on
the
precede
evening
,
by
the
active
agency
of
Messrs

<EOS>
the
reflection
of
Sir
Mulberry
Hawk
---
if
such
a
term
can
be
apply
to
the
thought
of
the
systematic
and
calculate
man
of
dissipation
,
whose
joy
,
regret
,
pain
,
and
pleasure
,
be
all
of
self
,
and
who
would
seem
to
retain
nothing
of
the
intellectual
faculty
but
the
power
to
debase
himself
,
and
to
degrade
the
very
nature
whose
outward
semblance
he
wear
---
the
reflection
of
Sir
Mulberry
Hawk
turn
upon
Kate
Nickleby
,
and
be
,
in
brief
,
that
she
be
undoubtedly
handsome
;
that
her
coyness
MUST
be
easily
conquerable
by
a
man
of
his
address
and
experience
,
and
that
the
pursuit
be
one
which
could
not
fail
to
redound
to
his
credit
,
and
greatly
to
enhance
his
reputation
with
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
and
lest
this
last
consideration
---
no
mean
or
secondary
one
with
Sir
Mulberry
---
should
sound
strangely
in
the
ear
of
some
,
let
it
be
remember
that
most
man
live
in
a
world
of
their
own
,
and
that
in
that
limited
circle
alone
be
they
ambitious
for
distinction
and
applause
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Mulberry
's
world
be
people
with
profligate
,
and
he
act
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
thus
,
case
of
injustice
,
and
oppression
,
and
tyranny
,
and
the
most
extravagant
bigotry
,
be
in
constant
occurrence
among
us
every
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
custom
to
trumpet
forth
much
wonder
and
astonishment
at
the
chief
actor
therein
set
at
defiance
so
completely
the
opinion
of
the
world
;
but
there
be
no
great
fallacy
;
it
be
precisely
because
they
do
consult
the
opinion
of
their
own
little
world
that
such
thing
take
place
at
all
,
and
strike
the
great
world
dumb
with
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
the
reflection
of
Mrs
Nickleby
be
of
the
proud
and
most
complacent
kind
;
and
under
the
influence
of
her
very
agreeable
delusion
<EOS>
she
straightway
sit
down
and
indite
a
long
letter
to
Kate

in
which
she
express
her
entire
approval
of
the
admirable
choice
she
have
make
,
and
extoll
Sir

to

assert
,
for
the
more
complete
satisfaction
of
her

that

the
individual

have
choose

the
good

with
the
preliminary
observation
that

be
fairly
suppose
not

world
so
long
without
know
its
way
,
communicate
a
great
many
subtle
precept
applicable
to
the
state

confirm
in
their

by
her

above
all

she
commend
a
strict
maidenly

<EOS>
to
judge
from
the
glow
which
suffuse
the
poor

after

Mrs

with
some

how

It
be
to
the
secret
annoyance
of
his
wife
that
Mr
Wititterly
say
all
this
,
for
,
although
she
be
burst
with
pride

arrogance

she
would
have
have
the
illustrious
guest
believe
that

visit

quite
a

that
they
have
lord

see
them
every

Mr

feeling
be
beyond
the
power

<EOS>
"
It

"
 
<EOS>
in
illustration
of
which
remark
,
Mr
Wititterly
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
from
his
box
,
and
jerk
it
lightly
into
the
air
as
an
emblem
of
instability

<EOS>
"
not
that

say
Mr

look
about
him
with
a
serious
countenance

<EOS>
"
Sir
Tumley
Snuffim
would
not
give
that
for

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Wititterly
tell
this
with
a
kind
of
sober
exultation

as
if
it
be
no
trifle
distinction
for
a
man
to
have
a
wife
in
such
a
desperate
state
,
and
Mrs
Wititterly
sigh
and
look
on
,
as
if
she
feel
the
honour

have
determine
to
bear
it
as
meekly

I
believe
I
may
venture
to
say
,
that

the

take
the

"
I

say
Mrs

,
in
a
faint
voice

<EOS>
as
there
appear
to
be
some
doubt
in
the
mind
of
his
patron
how
he
could
best
join
in
this
conversation
,
the
indefatigable
Mr
Pyke
throw
himself
into
the
breach
,
and
,
by
way
of
say
something
to
the
point
,
inquire
---
with
reference
to
the
aforesaid
medicine
---
whether
it
be
nice

<EOS>
"
no

it

not

It

Mr

"
Mrs

with
a
complimentary
bow

reply
her
husband
,
in
a
tone
which
seem
to
say
that
he
be
not

still
must
insist
upon
their
privilege

<EOS>
"
if
anybody

Mr

wheel
round

produce

all
I

that
I
shall
be
glad

that
martyr

male

that

all

my

"
   
<EOS>
Pyke
and
Pluck
promptly
remark
that
certainly
nothing
could
be
fair
than
that
;
and
the
call
have
be
by
this
time
protract
to
a
very
great
length

they
obey
Sir
Mulberry
's
look

and
rise
to
go

this
bring
Sir
Mulberry
himself
and
Lord
Verisopht
on
their
leg
also

many
protestation
of
friendship

and
expression
anticipative
of
the
pleasure
which
must
inevitably
flow
from
so
happy
an
acquaintance

and
the
visitor
depart
,
with
renew
assurance
<EOS>
that
at
all
time
and
season
the
mansion
of
the
Wititterlys
would
be
honour
by
receive
them
beneath
its
roof
.
   
<EOS>
that
they
come
at
all
time
and
season
---
that
they
dine
there
one
day
,
sup
the
next
,
dine
again
on
the
next
,
and
be
constantly
to
and
fro
on
all

that
they
make
party
to
visit
public
place

meet
by
accident
at
lounges

that
upon
all
these
occasion
Miss
Nickleby
be
expose
to
the
constant
and
unremitting
persecution
of
Sir
Mulberry
Hawk
,
who
now
begin
to
feel
his
character
,
even
in
the
estimation
of
his
two
dependant

involve
in
the
successful
reduction
of
her
pride
---
that
she
have
no
interval
of
peace
or
rest
,
except
at
those
hour
when
she
could
sit
in
her
solitary
room
,
and
weep
over
the
trial
of
the
day
<EOS>
---
all
these
be
consequence
naturally
flow
from
the
well
-
lay
plan
of
Sir
Mulberry
,
and
their
able
execution
by
the
auxiliary
,
Pyke
and
Pluck
.
   
<EOS>
and
thus
for
a
fortnight
matter
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
that
any
but
the
weak
and
silly
of
people
could
have
see
in
one
interview
that
Lord
Verisopht
,
though
he
be
a
lord
,
and
Sir
Mulberry
Hawk
,
though
he
be
a
baronet
,
be
not
person
accustom
to
be
the
good
possible
companion
,
and
be
certainly
not
calculate
by
habit
,
manner
,
taste
,
or
conversation
,
to
shine
with
any
very
great
lustre
in
the
society
of
lady
,
need
scarcely
be
remark
.
 
<EOS>
but
with
Mrs
wititterly
the
two
title
be
all
sufficient
;
coarseness
become
humour
,
vulgarity
soften
itself
down
into
the
most
charming
eccentricity
;
insolence
take
the
guise
of
an
easy
absence
of
reserve
,
attainable
only
by
those
who
have
have
the
good
fortune
to
mix
with
high
folk
.
   
<EOS>
if
the
mistress
put
such
a
construction
upon
the
behaviour
of
her
new
friend
,
what
could
the
companion
urge
against
them
?
 
<EOS>
if
they
accustom
themselves
to
very
little
restraint
before
the
lady
of
the
house
,
with
how
much
more
freedom
could
they
address
her
pay
dependent
!
 
<EOS>
nor
be
even
this
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
odious
Sir
Mulberry
Hawk
attach
himself
to
Kate
with
less
and
less
of
disguise
,
Mrs
Wititterly
begin
to
grow
jealous
of
the
superior
attraction
of
Miss
Nickleby
.
 
<EOS>
if
this
feeling
have
lead
to
her
banishment
from
the
drawing
-
room
when
such
company
be
there
,
Kate
would
have
be
only
too
happy
and
willing
that
it
should
have
exist
,
but
unfortunately
for
her
she
possess
that
native
grace
and
true
gentility
of
manner
,
and
those
thousand
nameless
accomplishment
which
give
to
female
society
its
great
charm
;
if
these
be
valuable
anywhere
,
they
be
especially
so
where
the
lady
of
the
house
be
a
mere
animate
doll
.
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
that
Kate
have
the
double
mortification
of
be
an
indispensable
part
of
the
circle
when
Sir
Mulberry
and
his

take
an

if

there

exquisitely
absurd

which
,
at
all
time
more
calculated
to
provoke
mirth

anger

be
especially
so
at

moment

when
with
one
knee
upon

Mr

twirl
his

affect
the

applause
from

go

never

round
at

very
considerate

yes

I
think
it
be
under
the
circumstance

his

be
at
stake

Mr

quite
seriously

his
heart
fail
him

he
cast
about
for
some
other
way
of
annoy
you
,

make
himself
popular
at
the

time

for
that
be
the
point

notoriety

<EOS>
bless
you
,
if
he
have
pink
you
,
"
say
Mr

,
stop
to
make
a
calculation
in
his
mind
<EOS>
,
"
it
would
have
be
worth
---
ah
,
it
would
have
be
worth
eight
or
ten
shilling
a
week
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
town
would
have
come
to
see
the
actor
who
nearly
kill
a
man
by
mistake
;
I
should
not
wonder
if
it
have
get
him
an
engagement
in
London
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
oblige
to
try
some
other
mode
of
get
popular
,
and
this
one
occur
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
clever
idea
,
really
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
show
the
white
feather
,
and
let
him
pull
your
nose
,
he
would
have
get
it
into
the
paper
;
if
you
have
swear
the
peace
against
him
,
it
would
have
be
in
the
paper
too
,
and
he
would
have
be
just
as
much
talk
about
as
you
---
do
not
you
see
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
,
"
rejoin
Nicholas
;
"
but
suppose
I
be
to
turn
the
table
,
and
pull
his
nose
,
<EOS>
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
Would
that
make
his
fortune
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
do
not
think
it
would
,
"
reply
Mr
Folair
,
scratch
his
head
,
"
because
there
would
not
be
any
romance
about
it
,
and
he
would
not
be
favourably
know
.
 
<EOS>
to
tell
you
the
truth
though
,
he
do
not
calculate
much
upon
that
,
for
you
be
always
so
mild
-
spoken
,
and
be
so
popular
among
the
woman
,
that
we
do
not
suspect
you
of
show
fight

<EOS>
if
you
do
,
however
,
he
have
a
way
of
get
out
of
it
easily

depend
upon
that
.

<EOS>
"
have
he
?

rejoin
Nicholas

<EOS>
"
We
will
try

tomorrow
morning

you
can

interview
you
like

good
-
night

<EOS>
as
Mr
Folair
be
pretty
well
known
among
his
fellow
-
actor
for
a
man
who
delight
in
mischief
,
and
be
by
no
means
scrupulous
,
Nicholas
have
not
much
doubt
but
that
he
have
secretly
prompt
the
tragedian
in
the
course
he
have
take
,
and
,
moreover
,
that
he
would
have
carry
his
mission
with
a
very
high
hand
if
he
have
not
be
disconcert
by
the
very
unexpected
demonstration
with
which
it
have
be
receive
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
worth
his
while
to
be
serious
with
him
,
however
,
so
he
dismiss
the
pantomimist
,
with
a
gentle
hint
that
if
he
offend
again
it
would
be
under
the
penalty
of
a
broken
head
;
and
Mr
Folair
,
take
the
caution
in
exceedingly
good
part
,
walk
away
to
confer
with
his
principal
,
and
give
such
an
account
of
his
proceeding
as
he
may
think
best
calculated
to
carry
on
the
joke
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
no
doubt
report
that
Nicholas
be
in
a
state
of
extreme
bodily
fear
;
for
when
that
young
gentleman
walk
with
much
deliberation
down
to
the
theatre
next
morning
at
the
usual
hour
,
he
find
all
the
company
assemble
in
evident
expectation
,
and
Mr
Lenville
,
with
his
severe
stage
face
,
sit
majestically
on
a
table
,
whistle
defiance
.
   
<EOS>
now
the
lady
be
on
the
side
of
Nicholas
,
and
the
gentleman
(
be
jealous
)
be
on
the
side
of
the
disappointed
tragedian
;
so
that
the
latter
form
a
little
group
about
the
redoubtable
Mr
Lenville
,
and
the
former
look
on
at
a
little
distance
in
some
trepidation
and
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
on
Nicholas
stop
to
salute
them
,
Mr
Lenville
laugh
a
scornful
laugh
,
and
make
some
general
remark
touch
the
natural
history
of
puppy
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Nicholas
,
look
quietly
round
,
"
be
you
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
slave
!
<EOS>
"
return
Mr
Lenville
,
flourish
his
right
arm
,
and
approach
Nicholas
with
a
theatrical
stride
.
 
<EOS>
but
somehow
he
appear
just
at
that
moment
a
little
startled
,
as
if
Nicholas
do
not
look
quite
so
frightened
as
he
have
expect
,
and
come
all
at
once
to
an
awkward
halt
,
at
which
the
assemble
lady
burst
into
a
shrill
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
object
of
my
scorn
and
hatred
!
"
say
Mr
Lenville
,
"
I
hold
ye
in
contempt
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
laugh
in
very
unexpected
enjoyment
of
this
performance
;
and
the
lady
,
by
way
of
encouragement
,
laugh
louder
than
before
;
whereat
Mr
Lenville
assume
his
bitter
smile
,
and
express
his
opinion
that
they
be
"
minion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
they
shall
not
protect
ye
!
"
say
the
tragedian
,
take
an
upward
look
at
Nicholas
,
begin
at
his
boot
and
end
at
the
crown
of
his
head
,
and
then
a
downward
one
,
begin
at
the
crown
of
his
head
,
and
end
at
his
boot
---
which
two
look
,
as
everybody
know
,
express
defiance
on
the
stage
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
shall
not
protect
ye
---
boy
!
"
   
<EOS>
thus
speak
,
Mr
Lenville
fold
his
arm
,
and
treat
Nicholas
to
that
expression
of
face
with
which
,
in
melodramatic
performance
,
he
be
in
the
habit
of
regard
the
tyrannical
king
when
they
say
,
"
away
with
him
to
the
deep
dungeon
beneath
the
castle
moat
;
"
and
which
,
accompany
with
a
little
jingling
of
fetter

have
be

Newman
take
upon

He
entreat

there

they

he
think
circumstance
may
occur

be
occur

which
would
render
it
absolutely
necessary
that
Kate
should
have
her
brother

protection

if
so

Newman
say
,
he
would
write
to
him
to
that
effect
,
either
by

one

<EOS>
Nicholas
read
this
passage
very
often

the
more
he
think
of
it
<EOS>
the
more
he
begin
to
fear
some
treachery
upon
the

of
Ralph

<EOS>
once

twice
he
feel
tempt
to
repair
to
London
at
all
hazard
without
an
hour

delay

a
little
reflection
assure
him
that
if
such
a
step
be
necessary

Newman
would
have
speak
out

tell
him
so
at

now
this

not
exactly
the
kind
of
reply
suit
to
Mr

's
importance
as
a
man
and
a
father
,
so
he
pick
out
the
unfortunate
Mrs

,
and
ask
her
what
the
devil
she

talk
to
him

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
"
say
Mr

.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
not
suppose
there
be
anybody
here

"
   
<EOS>
"
nobody

<EOS>
"
nobody
would
if
they
do
want
to
,
"
say
Mr
Snevellicci
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
ashamed
of
myself
,
Snevellicci
be
my
name
;
I
be
to
be
find
in
Broad
Court
,
Bow
Street
,
when
I
be
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
not
at
home
,
let
any
man
ask
for
me
at
the
stage
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
Damme
,
they
know
me
at
the
stage
-
door
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Most
man
have
see
my
portrait
at
the
cigar
shop
round
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
mention
in
the
newspaper
before
now
,
have
not
I
?
 
<EOS>
talk
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
<EOS>
what
;
if
I
find
out
that
any
man
have
be
tamper
with
the
affection
of
my
daughter
,
I
would
not
talk
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
astonish
him
without
talk
;
that
be
my
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
so
say
,
Mr
Snevellicci
strike
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
three
smart
blow
with
his
clenched
fist
;
pull
a
phantom
nose
with
his
right
thumb
and
forefinger
,
and
swallow
another
glassful
at
a
draught
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
way
,
"
repeat
Mr
Snevellicci
.
   
<EOS>
Most
public
character
have
their
failing
;
and
the
truth
be
that
Mr
Snevellicci
be
a
little
addicted
to
drink
;
or
,
if
the
whole
truth
must
be
tell
,
that
he
be
scarcely
ever
sober
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
in
his
cup
three
distinct
stage
of
intoxication
,
---
the
dignified
---
the
quarrelsome
---
the
amorous
.
 
<EOS>
when
professionally
engage
he
never
get
beyond
the
dignified
;
in
private
circle
he
go
through
all
three
,
pass
from
one
to
another
with
a
rapidity
of
transition
often
rather
perplexing
to
those
who
have
not
the
honour
of
his
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
thus
Mr
Snevellicci
have
no
sooner
swallow
another
glassful
than
he
smile
upon
all
present
in
happy
forgetfulness
of
have
exhibit
symptom
of
pugnacity
,
and
propose
"
the
lady
!
 
<EOS>
bless
their
heart
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
a
most
vivacious
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
love
'
em

"
say
Mr
Snevellicci
,
<EOS>
look
round
the
table
,
"
I
love

"
   
<EOS>
"
not

reason
Mr

,
mildly

<EOS>
"
yes

repeat
Mr

<EOS>
"
that
would

say
Mr

.
   
<EOS>
"
I
love
them
too
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr
Snevellicci
.
   
<EOS>
the
collector
look
into
the
surround
face
with
an
aspect
of
grave
astonishment
,
seem
to
say
,
"
this
be
a
nice
man
!
"
and
appear
a
little
surprised
that
Mrs
Lillyvick
's
manner
yield
no
evidence
of
horror
and
indignation
.
   
<EOS>
"
one
good
turn
deserve
another

"
say
Mr
Snevellicci
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
love
them
and
they
love
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
as
if
this
avowal
be
not
make
in
sufficient
disregard
and
defiance
of
all
moral
obligation
,
what
do
Mr
Snevellicci
do
?
 
<EOS>
He
wink
---
wink
openly
and
undisguisedly

upon
Henrietta
Lillyvick

<EOS>
the
collector
fall
back
in
his
chair
in
the
intensity
of
his
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
if
anybody
have
wink
at
her
as
Henrietta
Petowker
,
it
would
have
be
indecorous
in
the
last
degree
;
but
as
Mrs
Lillyvick
!
 
<EOS>
while
he
think
of
it
in
a
cold
perspiration

and
wonder
whether
it
be
possible
that
he
could

Mr
Snevellicci
repeat
the
wink

and

Mrs

Mr

straight
up

with

of
Miss

still
fresh
in

steadily
resist

They

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
They

,
hurry
away
to
tell
Mrs

the
only
term
that
could

<EOS>

<EOS>
everybody

to
know
that
the
London
manager
have
come
down
specially
to
witness
his
or
her
own
performance
,
and
all
be
in
a
flutter
of
anxiety
and
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
those
who
be
not
on
in
the
first
scene
,
hurry
to
the
wing
,
and
there
stretch
their
neck
to
have
a
peep
at

;
other

into

at
the
comic

<EOS>
,
"

this
company
next
Saturday
night

"
   
<EOS>
in
the
same
way
,
everybody
who
be
on
the
stage
beheld
no
audience
but
one
individual
;
everybody
play
to
the
London
manager
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mr
Lenville
in
a
sudden
burst
of
passion
call
the
emperor
a
miscreant
,
and
then
bite
his
glove
,
say
,
"
but
I
must
dissemble
,
"
instead
of
look
gloomily
at
the
board
and
so
wait
for
his
cue
,
as
be
proper
in
such
case
<EOS>
,
he
keep
his
eye
fix
upon
the
London

<EOS>
when
Miss
Bravassa

her
song
at
her
lover
,
who
accord
to
custom
stand
ready
to
shake
hand
with
her
between
the
verse
,
they
look
,
not
at
each
other
,
but
at
the
London
manager
.
<EOS>
Mr
Crummles
die
point
blank
at
him
;
and
when
the
two
guard
come
in
to
take
the
body
off
after
a
very
hard
death
,
it
be
see
to
open
its
eye
and
glance
at
the
London

<EOS>
at
length
the
London

be
asleep
,
and
shortly
after
that
he

whereupon
all
the
company
fall
foul
of
the
unhappy
comic
countryman
,
declare
that
his
buffoonery
be
the
sole
cause
;
and
Mr
Crummles
say
,
that
he
have
put
up
with
it
a
long
time
,
but
that
he
really
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
,
and
therefore
would
feel
oblige
by
his
look
out
for
another
engagement
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
be
the
occasion
of
much
amusement
to
Nicholas

whose
only
feel
upon

one
of
sincere

and
cause
Mr

the
pilot
to
take
his
morning

bedstead
and
be
put
on
their

with
great
rapidity
,
under
the
impression
that
it
be
the
middle
of
the
night
,
and
the
next
house
be
on
fire
.
   
<EOS>
before
he
could

something
about

<EOS>
"

Nicholas

<EOS>
"

last
night
more
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
not

not

"
reply
Nicholas
,
impatiently
.
   
<EOS>
"
will
not
you
stop
to
say
something
to
Mrs
Crummles
?
<EOS>
"
ask
the
manager
,
follow
him
down
to
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
stop
if
it
be
to
prolong
my

a
score
of

<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
accompany
these
word
with
an
impatient
stamp
upon
the
ground
,
he
tear
himself
from
the
manager
's
detain
grasp
,
and
dart
rapidly
down
the
street
be
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
.
   
<EOS>
"
dear

,
dear
me
,
"
say
Mr
Crummles
,
look
wistfully
towards
the
point
at
which
he
have
just
disappear
;
"
if
he
only
act
like
that
,
what
a
deal
of
money
he
would
draw
!
 
<EOS>
He
should
have
keep
upon
this
circuit
;
he
would
have
be
very
useful
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
know
what
be
good
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
impetuous
youth
.
 
<EOS>
young

rash
,
very
rash

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crummles
be
in
a
moralising
mood
,
may
possibly
have
moralise
for
some
minute
longer
if
he
have
not
mechanically
put
his
hand
towards
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
where
he
be
accustomed
to
keep
his
snuff
.
 
<EOS>
the
absence
of
any
pocket
at
all
in
the
usual
direction
,
suddenly
recall
to
his
recollection
the
fact
that
he
have
no
waistcoat
on
;
and
this
lead
him
to
a
contemplation
of
the
extreme
scantiness
of
his
attire
,
he
shut
the
door
abruptly
,
and
retire
upstairs
with
great
precipitation
.
   
<EOS>
Smike
have
make
good
speed
while
Nicholas
be
absent
,
and
with
his
help
everything
be
soon
ready
for
their
departure
.
 
<EOS>
They
scarcely
stop
to
take
a
morsel
of
breakfast
,
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
arrive
at
the
coach
-
office
:
quite
out
of
breath
with
the
haste
they
have
make
to
reach
it
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
yet
a
few
minute
to
spare
,
so

have
secure
the
place
,
Nicholas
hurry
into
a
slopseller
's
hard
by
,
and
buy
Smike
a
great

coat
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
rather
large
for
a
substantial
yeoman
,
but
the
shopman
averring
(
and
with
considerable
truth
)
that
it
be
a
most
uncommon
fit
<EOS>
,
Nicholas
would
have
purchase
it
in
his
impatience
if
it
have
be
twice
the
size

<EOS>
as
they
hurry
up
to
the
coach

which
be
now
in
the
open
street
and
all
ready
for

Nicholas
be
not
a
little
astonished
to
find
himself
suddenly
clutch
in
a
close
and
violent
embrace
,
which
nearly
take
him
off
his
leg
;
nor
be
his
amazement
at
all
lessen
by
hear
the
voice
of
Mr

strain
him
to
his
breast
again
,
exclaim
as
he
do
so
,
"
farewell

my
noble
,
my
lion

"
   
<EOS>
in

have
turn
out
for
the
express

the
high

forth
at
the

time
all
the
most
dismal
form
of
farewell

could
think
of

to
the
interview

take

on
the
previous
day

<EOS>
at
such
interval
,
after
a
few
moment
of
abstraction

Ralph
would
mutter
some
peevish
interjection
,
and
apply
himself
with
renew
steadiness
of
purpose
to
the
ledger
before
him

but
again
and
again
the

come
back
despite
all
his

to
prevent
it
,
confuse
him
in
his
calculation
,
and
utterly
distract
his
attention
from
the

over
which
he
bend

<EOS>
at
length
Ralph
lay
down
his
pen

throw
himself
back
in

with
which
he
sneer
at

something

He
think
of
what

upon

her

again
upon
his

gentle
pressure
of
the
tremble
hand
;
he
strew
his
costly
room
with
the
hundred
silent
token
of
feminine
presence
and
occupation

he
come
back
again
to
the
cold

one
glimpse

nature

<EOS>
gold
,
for
the
instant
,
lose
its
lustre
in
his
eye
,
for
there
be
countless
treasure
of
the
heart
which
it
could
never
purchase
.
   
<EOS>
a
very
slight
circumstance
be
sufficient
to
banish
such
reflection
from
the
mind
of
such
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
as
Ralph
look
vacantly
out
across
the
yard
towards
the
window
of
the
other
office
,
he
become
suddenly
aware
of
the
earnest
observation
of
Newman
Noggs
,
who
,
with
his
red
nose
almost
touch
the
glass
,
feign
to
be
mend
a
pen
with
a
rusty
fragment
of
a
knife
,
but
be
in
reality
stare
at
his
employer
with
a
countenance
of
the
close
and
most
eager
scrutiny
.
   
<EOS>
Ralph
exchange
his
dreamy
posture
for
his
accustomed
business
attitude
:
the
face
of
Newman
disappear
,
and
the
train
of
thought
take
to
flight
,
all
simultaneously
,
and
in
an
instant
.
   
<EOS>
after
a
few
minute
,
Ralph
ring
his
bell
.
 
<EOS>
Newman
answer
the
summon
,
and
Ralph
raise
his
eye
stealthily
to
his
face
,
as
if
he
almost
fear
to
read
there
,
a
knowledge
of
his
recent
thought
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
small
speculation
,
however
,
in
the
countenance
of
Newman
Noggs
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
possible
to
imagine
a
man
,
with
two
eye
in
his
head
,
and
both
wide
open
,
look
in
no
direction
whatever
,
and
see
nothing
,
Newman
appear
to
be
that
man
while
Ralph
Nickleby
regard
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
now
?
"
growl
Ralph
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Newman
,
throw
some
intelligence
into
his
eye
all
at
once
,
and
drop
them
on
his
master
<EOS>
,
"
I
think
you
rang
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
which
laconic
remark
Newman
turn
round
and
hobble
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
stop
!
"

Ralph
.
   
<EOS>
Newman
stop
;
not
at
all
disconcert

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do

then
why
do
you
offer

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
rang
to

you

reply
Newman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
often
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
pry
,
and
peer
,
and
stare
at
me
,

demand
Ralph

<EOS>
"
stare

<EOS>

Newman
,
"
at
you

which
be
all
the
explanation
Newman
deign
to
offer

<EOS>
"
be
careful

Ralph
,
look
steadily
at
him

me
have
no
drunken
fooling
here

do
you
see
this
parcel

"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
big
enough
,
"
rejoin
Newman
.
   
<EOS>
"
carry
it
into
the
city
;
to
Cross
,
in
Broad
Street
,
and
leave
it
there
---
quick
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
hear
?
"
   
<EOS>
Newman
give
a
dog
kind
of
nod
to
express
an
affirmative
reply
,
and
,
leave
the
room
for
a
few
second
,
return
with
his
hat
.
<EOS>
have
make
various
ineffective
attempt
to
fit
the
parcel
(
which
be
some
two
foot
square
)
into
the
crown
thereof
,
Newman
take
it
under
his
arm
,
and
after
put
on
his
fingerless
glove
with
great
precision
and
nicety
,
keep
his
eye
fix
upon
Mr
Ralph
Nickleby
all
the
time
,
he
adjust
his
hat
upon
his
head
with
as
much
care
,
real
or
pretend
,
as
if
it
be
a
bran
-
new
one
of
the
most
expensive
quality
,
and
at
last
depart
on
his
errand
.
   
<EOS>
He
execute
his
commission
with
great
promptitude
and
dispatch
,
only
call
at
one
public
-
house
for
half
a
minute
,
and
even
that
may
be
say
to
be
in
his
way
,
for
he
go
in
at
one
door
and
come
out
at
the
other
;
but
as
he
return
and
have
get
so
far
homeward
as
the
Strand
,
Newman
begin
to
loiter
with
the
uncertain
air
of
a
man
who
have
not
quite
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
halt
or
go
straight
forwards
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
very
short
consideration
,
the
former
inclination
prevail
,
and
make
towards
the
point
he
have
have
in
his
mind
,
Newman
knock
a
modest
double
knock
,
or
rather
a
nervous
single
one
,
at
Miss
La
Creevy
's
door
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
open
by
a
strange
servant
,
on
whom
the
odd
figure
of
the
visitor
do
not
appear
to
make
the
most
favourable
impression
possible
,
inasmuch
as
she
no
sooner
see
him
than
she
very
nearly
close
it
,
and
place
herself
in
the
narrow
gap
,
inquire
what
he
want
.
 
<EOS>
but
Newman
merely
utter
the
monosyllable
"
Noggs
,
"
as
if
it
be
some
cabalistic
word
,
at
sound
of
which
bolt
would
fly
back
and
door
open
,
push
briskly
past
and
gain
the
door
of
Miss
La
Creevy
's
sitting
-
room
,
before
the
astonished
servant
could
offer
any
opposition
.
   
<EOS>
"
walk
in
if
you
please
,
"
say
Miss
La
Creevy
in
reply
to
the
sound
of
Newman
's
knuckle
;
and
in
he
walk
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
bless
us
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Miss
La
Creevy
,
start
as
Newman
bolt
in
;
"
what
do
you
want

sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
forget
me
,
"
say
Newman
,
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
at
that
.
 
<EOS>
that
nobody
should
remember
me
who
know
me
in
other
day

be
natural
enough
;

there
be
few
people
who

see
me
once
,
forget
me
now

"
 
<EOS>
He
glance
,
as
he
speak
,
at
his
shabby
clothe
and
paralytic
limb
,
and
slightly
shake
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
forget
you
,
I
declare
,
"
say
Miss
La
Creevy
,
rise
to
receive
Newman
,
who
meet
her
half
-
way
,
"
and
I
be
ashamed
of
myself
for
do
so
;
for
you
be
a
kind
,
good
creature
,
Mr
Noggs
.
 
<EOS>
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
about
Miss
Nickleby

<EOS>
poor
dear
thing
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
her
for
this
many
a
week

"
   
<EOS>
"
how
be
that
?
"
ask
Newman

<EOS>
"
why

the
truth
be
,
Mr
Noggs

Miss
La

,
"

I

out
on

for
fifteen
year

<EOS>
"
that
be
a
long
time
,
"

Newman
,
sadly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
it
be
a
very
long
time
to
look
back
upon
in
year

or
other

Heaven

,
the
solitary
day
roll
away
peacefully

happily
enough

reply
the
miniature
painter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
brother
,
Mr
Noggs

the
only
relation
I
have

<EOS>
all
that
time
I
never

him
once

not
that
we
ever

he
be
apprentice
down
in

he
get

new
tie

affection
spring
up
about
him

very
reasonable

he
should

you
know

<EOS>
do
not

I

that

I

to
myself

have
a

of
that
very

brother

up
to
London
at
last

never

out

what
do

here

sit
down

quite

this
remarkable
demonstration
;
but
that
do
,
Newman
faithfully
relate
all
that
have
pass
in
the
interview
between
Kate
and
her
uncle
,
preface
his
narrative
with
a
statement
of
his
previous
suspicion
on
the
subject
,
and
his
reason
for
form
them
;
and
conclude
with
a
communication
of
the
step
he
have
take
in
secretly
write
to
Nicholas
.
   
<EOS>
though
little
Miss
La
Creevy
's
indignation
be
not
so
singularly
display
as
Newman
's
,
it
be
scarcely
inferior
in
violence
and
intensity
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
Ralph
Nickleby
have
happen
to
make
his
appearance
in
the
room
at
that
moment
,
there
be
some
doubt
whether
he
would
not
have
find
Miss
La
Creevy
a
more
dangerous
opponent
than
even
Newman
Noggs
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
forgive
me
for
say
so
,
"
say
Miss
La
Creevy
,
as
a
wind
-
up
to
all
her
expression
of
anger
,
"
but
I
really
feel
as
if
I
could
stick
this
into
him
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
very
awful
weapon
that
Miss
La
Creevy
hold
<EOS>
,
it
be
in
fact
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
black
-
lead
pencil
;
but
discover
her
mistake
,
the
little
portrait
painter
exchange
it
for
a
mother
-
of

pearl
fruit
knife
,
wherewith
,
in
proof
of
her
desperate
thought
,
she
make
a
lunge
as
she
speak

which
would
have
scarcely
disturb

She

Newman
leave

his

"
depend

earnestly
,
"
if

out

I
come
to

"

this
be

interrupt
Miss

;
"
that
you

have
be
sure

the

nobody

you
be

guarded

<EOS>
"
what
CAN
I
do

"
cry
Newman
,
scratch
his
head
with
an
air
of
great
vexation
and
perplexity

<EOS>
"
if
he
be
to
talk

I
should

oblige

serve

right

"
<EOS>
"
   
Miss
La
Creevy
could
not
suppress
a
small
shriek
on
hear
this
,
and
instantly
set
about
extort
a
solemn
pledge
from
Newman
that
he
would
use
his
utmost
endeavour
to
pacify
the
wrath
of
Nicholas
;
which
,
after
some
demur
,
be
concede
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
consult
together
on
the
safe
and
sure
mode
of
communicate
to
him
the
circumstance
which
have
render
his
presence
necessary
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
time
to
cool
before
he
can
possibly
do
anything
,
"
say
Miss
La
Creevy
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
of
the
great
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
not
be
tell
until
late
at
night

"
   
<EOS>
"
but
he
will
be
in
town
between
six
and
seven
this
evening
,
"
reply
Newman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
keep
it
from
him
when
he
ask
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
you
must
go
out
,
Mr
Noggs
,
"

Miss

<EOS>
"
You
can
easily
have

keep
away

business

midnight

<EOS>
"
then
he
will
come
straight
here

retort
Newman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
suppose
,
"
observe
Miss
La

;
"
but
he
will
not
find
me
at
home
,
for
I
will
go
straight
to
the

<EOS>
the
instant
you
leave
me
,
make
up
matter
with
Mrs
Nickleby
,

take
her
away
to

so
that

may
not

"
   
<EOS>
upon
further
discussion
,
this
appear
the
safe
and
most
feasible
mode
of
proceeding
that
could
possibly
be
adopt

<EOS>
therefore
it
be
finally
determine
that
matter
should
be
so
arrange
,
and
Newman
,
after
listen
to
many
supplementary
caution
and
entreaty
,
take
his
leave
of
Miss
La

and
trudge
back
to
Golden
Square

ruminate
as
he
go
upon
a
vast
number
of
possibility

crowd
upon

back

observe
the
coachman
,
look
over
his

at
Nicholas

no
very
pleasant
expression

"

ay

he
let
out
his

touch
up
a

He

I

there

however

he
leave

that
I
be
to

you

which
I

"
   
<EOS>
in
proof
of
his
extreme
readiness
to
exert
himself
for
the
general
entertainment
,
Mr
Crowl
draw
a
chair
to
the
table
as
he
speak
,
and
help
himself
plentifully
to
the
cold
meat
,
invite
Nicholas
and
Smike
to
follow
his
example
.
   
<EOS>
disappointed

uneasy

Nicholas
could
touch
no

so
,
after
he
have
see
Smike
comfortably
establish
at

table
<EOS>
,
he
walk
out
(
despite
a
great
many
dissuasion
utter
by
Mr
Crowl
with
his
mouth
full
)
,
and
leave
Smike
to
detain
Newman
in
case
he
return
first
.
   
<EOS>
as
Miss
La
Creevy
have
anticipate
,
Nicholas
betook
himself
straight
to
her
house
.
 
<EOS>
find
her
from
home
,
he
debate
within
himself
for
some
time
whether
he
should
go
to
his
mother
's
residence
,
and
so
compromise
her
with
Ralph
Nickleby
.
 
<EOS>
fully
persuade
,
however
,
that
Newman
would
not
have
solicit
him
to
return
unless
there
be
some
strong
reason
which
require
his
presence
at
home
,
he
resolve
to
go
there
,
and
hasten
eastward
with
all
speed
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Nickleby
would
not
be
at
home
,
the
girl
say
,
until
past
twelve
,
or
later
.
 
<EOS>
She
believe
Miss
Nickleby
be
well
,
but
she
do
not
live
at
home
now
,
nor
do
she
come
home
except
very
seldom
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
say
where
she
be
stop
,
but
it
be
not
at
Madame
Mantalini
's
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
of
that
.
   
<EOS>
with
his
heart
beat
violently
,
and
apprehend
<EOS>
he
know
<EOS>
not
what
disaster
,
Nicholas
return
to
where
he
have
leave
Smike
.
 
<EOS>
Newman
have
not
be
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
be
,
till
twelve
o'clock
;
there
be
no
chance
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
no
possibility
of
send
to
fetch
him
if
it
be
only
for
an
instant
,
or
forward
to
him
one
line
of
writing
to
which
he
may
return
a
verbal
reply
?
 
<EOS>
that
be
quite
impracticable
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
at
Golden
Square
,
and
probably
have
be
send
to
execute
some
commission
at
a
distance
.
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
try
to
remain
quietly
where
he
be
,
but
he
feel
so
nervous
and
excited
that
he
could
not
sit
still
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
lose
time
unless
he
be
move
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
absurd
fancy
,
he
know
,
but
he
be
wholly
unable
to
resist
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
take
up
his
hat
and
ramble
out
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
stroll
westward
this
time
,
pace
the
long
street
with
hurried
footstep
,
and
agitate
by
a
thousand
misgiving
and
apprehension
which
he
could
not
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
He
pass
into
Hyde
Park
,
now
silent
and
desert
,
and
increase
his
rate
of
walk
as
if
in
the
hope
of
leave
his
thought
behind
.
 
<EOS>
They
crowd
upon
him
more
thickly
,
however
,
now
there
be
no
pass
object
to
attract
his
attention
;
and
the
one
idea
be
always
uppermost
,
that
some
stroke
of
ill
-
fortune
must
have
occur
so
calamitous
in
its
nature
that
all
be
fearful
of
disclose
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
question
arise
again
and
again
---
what
could
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
walk
till
he
be
weary
,
but
be
not
one
bit
the
wise
;
and
indeed
he
come
out
of
the
Park
at
last
a
great
deal
more
confused
and
perplex
than
when
he
go
in
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
take
scarcely
anything
to
eat
or
drink
since
early
in
the
morning
,
and
feel
quite
worn
out
and
exhaust
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
return
languidly
towards
the
point
from
which
he
have
start
,
along
one
of
the
thoroughfare
which
lie
between
Park
Lane
and
Bond
Street
,
he
pass
a
handsome
hotel
,
before
which
he
stop
mechanically
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
an
expensive
place
,
I
dare
say
,
"
think
Nicholas
;
"
but
a
pint
of
wine
and
<EOS>
a
biscuit
be
no
great
debauch
wherever
they
be
have
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
do
not
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
walk
on
a
few
step
,
but
look
wistfully
down
the
long
vista
of
gas
-
lamp
before
him
,
and
think
how
long
it
would
take
to
reach
the
end
of
it
and
be
besides
in
that
kind
of
mood
in
which
a
man
be
most
disposed
to
yield
to
his
first
impulse
---
and
be
,
besides
,
strongly
attract
to
the
hotel
,
in
part
by
curiosity
,
and
in
part
by
some
odd
mixture
of
feeling
which
he
would
have
be
trouble
to
define
---
<EOS>
Nicholas
turn
back
again
,
and
walk
into
the
coffee
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
very
handsomely
furnish
.
 
<EOS>
the
wall
be
ornament
with
the
choicest
specimen
of
french
paper
,
enrich
with
a
gilded
cornice
of
elegant
design
.
 
<EOS>
the
floor
be
cover
with
a
rich
carpet
;
and
two
superb
mirror
,
one
above
the
chimneypiece
and
one
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
reach
from
floor
to
ceiling
,
multiply
the
other
beauty
and
add
new
one
of
their
own
to
enhance
the
general
effect
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
rather
noisy
party
of
four
gentleman
in
a
box
by
the
fire
-
place
,
and
only
two
other
person
present
---
both
elderly
gentleman
,
and
both
alone
.
   
<EOS>
observe
all
this
in
the
first
comprehensive
glance
with
which
a
strange
survey
a
place
that
be
new
to
him
,
Nicholas
sit
himself
down
in
the
box
next
to
the
noisy
party
,
with
his
back
towards
them
,
and
postpone
his
order
for
a
pint
of
claret
until
such
time
as
the
waiter
and
one
of
the
elderly
gentleman
should
have
settle
a
dispute
question
relative
to
the
price
of
an
item
in
the
bill
of
fare
,
take
up
a
newspaper
and
begin
to
read
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
not
read
twenty
line
,
and
be
in
truth
himself
doze
,
when
he
be
startle
by
the
mention
of
his
sister
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
Little
Kate
Nickleby
"
be
the
word
that
catch
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
He
raise
his
head
in
amazement
,
and
as
he
do
so
,
see
by
the
reflection
in
the
opposite
glass
,
that
two
of
the
party
behind
him
have
rise
and
be
stand
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
come
from
one
of
them
,
"
think
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
He
wait
to
hear
more
with
a
countenance
of
some
indignation
,
for
the
tone
of
speech
have
be
anything
but
respectful
,
and
the
appearance
of
the
individual
whom
he
presume
to
have
be
the
speaker
be
coarse
and
swagger
.
   
<EOS>
this
person
---
so
Nicholas
observe
in
the
same
glance
at
the
mirror
which
have
enable
him
to
see
his
face
---
be
stand
with
his
back
to
the
fire
converse
with
a
young
man
,
who
stand
with
his
back
to
the
company
,
wear
his
hat
,
and
be
adjust
his
shirt
-
collar
by
the
aid
of
the
glass
.
 
<EOS>
They
speak
in
whisper
,
now
and
then
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
,
but
Nicholas
could
catch
no
repetition
of
the
word
,
nor
anything
sound
at
all
like
the
word
,
which
have
attract
his
attention
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
the
two
resume
their
seat
,
and
more
wine
be
order
,
the
party
grow
loud
in
their
mirth
.
 
<EOS>
still
there
be
no
reference
make
to
anybody
with
whom
he
be
acquaint
,
and
Nicholas
become
persuade
that
his
excited
fancy
have
either
imagine
the
sound
altogether
,
or
convert
some
other
word
into
the
name
which
have
be
so
much
in
his
thought
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
remarkable
too
,
"
think
nichola
:
"
if
it
have
be
"
Kate
"
or
"
Kate
Nickleby

"
I
should
not

<EOS>
the
wine

at
the
moment

his

the
sentence

<EOS>
He
swallow
a
glassful

take
up
the
paper
again
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
instant

"
Little

the
voice
behind
him

<EOS>
"
I
be
right

mutter
Nicholas
as
the

fall
from
his

<EOS>
and
it
be
the
man
I
suppose

"
   
<EOS>
"
as
there
be
a
proper
objection
to

keenly
alive
to
the

this
slight
and
careless
mention
of
his

in
a
public
place

Nicholas

at
once

but
he
keep
himself
quiet
by
a
great
effort

do
not

<EOS>
"

who
sit
opposite

draw
a
toothpick
from

I
denounce

save
him
the
disgrace
of

Sir

look
at

contemptuously

,
address
his

nothing

<EOS>
Sir
Mulberry
's
hand
involuntarily
close
upon
the
decanter
,
and
he
seem
for
an
instant
about
to
launch
it
at
the
head
of
his
challenger
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
only
fill
his
glass
,
and
laugh
in
derision
.
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
sit
himself
down
,
directly
opposite
to
the
party
,
and
,
summon
the
waiter
,
pay
his
bill
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
that
person
's
name
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquire
of
the
man
in
an
audible
voice
;
point
out
Sir
Mulberry
as
he
put
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Mulberry
laugh
again
,
and
the
two
voice
which
have
always
speak
together
,
echo
the
laugh
;
but
rather
feebly
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
gentleman
,
sir
?
"
reply
the
waiter
,
who
,
no
doubt
,
know
his
cue
,
and
answer
with
just
as
little
respect
,
and
just
as
much
impertinence
as
he
could
safely
show
:
"
no
,
sir
,
I
do
not
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
here
,
you
sir

cry
Sir

as
the

"
   
<EOS>
"
name

sir

no

"
   
<EOS>
"
then
you
will
find
it
there
,
"
say
Sir
Mulberry
,
throw
Nicholas
's
card
towards
him
;
"
and
when
you
have
make
yourself
master
of
it
,
put
that
piece
of
pasteboard
in
the
fire
---
do
you
hear
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
man
grin
,
and
,
look
doubtfully
at
Nicholas
,
compromise
the
matter
by
stick
the
card
in
the
chimney
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
have
do
this
,
he
retire
.
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
fold
his
arm
,
and
bite
his
lip
,
sit
perfectly
quiet
;
sufficiently
express
by
his
manner
,
however
,
a
firm
determination
to
carry
his
threat
of
follow
Sir
Mulberry
home
,
into
steady
execution
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
evident
from
the
tone
in
which
the
young
member
of
the
party
appear
to
remonstrate
with
his
friend
,
that
he
object
to
this
course
of
proceeding
,
and
urge
him
to
comply
with
the
request
which
Nicholas
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Mulberry
,
however
,
who
be
not
quite
sober
,
and
who
be
in
a
sullen
and
dogged
state
of
obstinacy
,
soon
silence
the
representation
of
his
weak
young
friend
,
and
further
seem
---
as
if
to
save
himself
from
a
repetition
of
them
---
to
insist
on
be
leave
alone
.
 
<EOS>
however
this
may
have
be
,
the
young
gentleman
and
the
two
who
have
always
speak
together
,
actually
rise
to
go
after
a
short
interval
,
and
presently
retire
,
leave
their
friend
alone
with
Nicholas
.
   
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
readily
suppose
that
to
one
in
the
condition
of
Nicholas
,
the
minute
appear
to
move
with
leaden
wing
indeed
,
and
that
their
progress
do
not
seem
the
more
rapid
from
the
monotonous
ticking
of
a
french
clock
,
or
the
shrill
sound
of
its
little
bell
which
tell
the
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
he
sit
;
and
in
his
old
seat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
recline
Sir
Mulberry
Hawk
,
with

vacantly
at

as

Nicholas

thousand

Nicholas

blind
to

still
maintain

in

these
word

and
Sir
Mulberry
shorten
his
whip
,
apply
it
furiously
to
the
head
and
shoulder
of
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
break
in
the
struggle
;
Nicholas
gain
the
heavy
handle
,
and
with
it
lay
open
one
side
of
his
antagonist
's
face
from
the
eye
to
the
lip
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
the
gash
;
know
that
the

have
dart
off
at
a
wild
mad
gallop
;
a
hundred
light
dance
in
his
eye
,
and
he
feel
himself
fling
violently
upon
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
giddy
and
sick
,
but
stagger
to
his
foot
directly
,
rouse
by
the
loud
shout
of
the
man

be
tear
up
the
street

scream
to
those
ahead
to
clear
the
way

<EOS>
He
be
conscious
of
a
torrent
of
people
rush
quickly
by

look
up
,
could
discern
the
cabriolet
whirl
along
the
foot

pavement
with
frightful
rapidity
---
then
hear
a
loud
cry
,
the
smashing
of
some
heavy
body
,
and
the
breaking
of
glass
---
<EOS>
and
then
the
crowd
close
in
in
the
distance
,
and
he
could
see
or
hear
no

<EOS>
the
general
attention

be
entirely
direct
from
himself
to
the
person
in
the
carriage

and
he

quite
alone

<EOS>
rightly
judge
that
under
such
circumstance
it
would
be
madness
to
follow

he
turn
down
a
bye

street
in
search
of
the
near
coach
-
stand
,
find
after
a
minute
or
two
that
he

reel
like
a
drunken

<EOS>
the
recital
make
a
strong
impression
on
the
warm
imagination
of
Newman

for
when
Nicholas
come
to
the
violent
part
of
the
quarrel
,
he
rub
so
hard
,
as
to
occasion
him
the
most
exquisite
pain
,
which
he
would
not

however

for

it

perfectly
clear
that

for
the
moment

Newman
be
operate
on

this

merely

into

glossy

as

the

the

feverish
agitation

insupportable

Wherefore

still
Newman
betray

so
,
Mr

comfort
himself
by
say
that
he

both
drunk

mad
;
and
,
with
this
parting
observation

he
lead
his
hopeful
son
away

<EOS>
in
exact
proportion
as
Ralph

It
may
be
,
that
to
atone
for
the
weakness
of
incline
to
any
one
person
,
he
hold
it
necessary
to
hate
some
other
more
intensely
than
before
;

such
have
be
the
course
of
his
feeling

<EOS>
and
now

him

to
feel
that
there
be
infection
in
his
touch

in
his
companionship

to
know
all
this

to
know

of
it
all
be
that

boyish
poor

who
have
twit
him
in
their
very
first
interview

work
his
quiet

stealthy
malignity
to
such
a

that
there

gratify
it

after

have
remain

in
a
disconsolate
state

at

Nicholas

I
must
present
the
poor

in
due
form

<EOS>
They
will
be
kind
to
him
for
his

and
if
not
(
on
that
account
solely
)
to
the
full
extent
I
could
wish

they

stretch
a

<EOS>
Nicholas

<EOS>
He

of

be
not
quite
so
certain
that
Smike
would
find
favour
in
the
eye
of
Mrs

<EOS>
"
however
,
"
think
Nicholas
as
he
depart
on
his
benevolent
errand
;
"
she
can
not
fail
to
become
attached
to
him
,
when
she
know
what
a
devoted

he
be

as
she
must
quickly
make
the
discovery

his
probation
will
be
a
short
one

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I

You

I

what
now

<EOS>
ask
Nicholas

look
kindly
in

<EOS>
"
what
now

old

<EOS>
"
I

Smike
,
press
his

;
"
except
one

<EOS>
I
shall
never

and
if
your
hand
place
me
in
the
grave
,
and
I
could
think
,
before
I
die
,
that
you
would
come
and
look
upon
it
sometimes
with
one
of
your
kind
smile
,
and
in
the
summer
weather
,
when
everything
be
alive
---
not
dead
like
me

I
could
go
to
that
home
almost
without
a

"
   
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
talk
thus
,
poor
boy
,
if
your
life
be
a
happy
one
with
me

"
say
Nicholas
.
   
<EOS>
"
because
I
should
change
;
not
those

I

never

reply
Smike

<EOS>
"
in

You

I

you

<EOS>
why

here
be
a
dismal
face
for
lady

company

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
my
pretty

you

so
often

me
about

<EOS>
be
this
your

<EOS>
for

<EOS>
for

"
   
<EOS>
Smike
brighten
up
and
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
I
talk
of
home
,
"
pursue
Nicholas
,
"
I
talk
of
mine
---
which
be
yours
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
define
by
any
particular
four
wall
and
a
roof
,
God
know
I
should
be
sufficiently
puzzle
to
say
whereabout
it
lie
;
but
that
be
not
what
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
speak
of
home
,
I
speak
of
the
place
where
---
in
default
of
a
well
---
those
I
love
be
gather
together
;
and
if
that
place
be
a
gypsy
's
tent
,
or
a
barn
,
I
should
call
it
by
the
same
good
name
notwithstanding
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
for
what
be
my
present
home
,
which
,
however
alarm
your
expectation
may
be
,
will
neither
terrify
you
by
its
extent
nor
its
magnificence
!
"
   
<EOS>
so
say
,
Nicholas
take
his
companion
by
the
arm
,
and
say
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
and
point
out
various
thing
to
amuse
and
interest
him
as
they
go
along
,
lead
the
way
to
Miss
La
Creevy
's
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
this
,
Kate
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
enter
the
room
where
his
sister
sit
alone
,
"
be
the
faithful
friend
and
affectionate
fellow
-
traveller
whom
I
prepare
you
to
receive
.
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Smike
be
bashful
,
and
awkward
,
and
frighten
enough
,
at
first
,
but
Kate
advance
towards
him
so
kindly
,
and
say
,
in
such
a
sweet
voice
,
how
anxious
she
have
be
to
see
him
after
all
her
brother
have
tell
her
,
and
how
much
she
have
to
thank
him
for
have
comfort
Nicholas
so
greatly
in
their
very
trying
reverse
,
that
he
begin
to
be
very
doubtful
whether
he
should
shed
tear
or
not
,
and
become
still
more
flurried
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
manage
to
say
,
in
a
broken
voice
,
that
Nicholas
be
his
only
friend
,
and
that
he
would
lay
down
his
life
to
help
him
;
and
Kate
,
although
she
be
so
kind
and
considerate
,
seem
to
be
so
wholly
unconscious
of
his
distress
and
embarrassment
,
that
he
recover
almost
immediately
and
feel
quite
at
home
.
   
<EOS>
then
,
Miss
La
Creevy
come
in
;
and
to
her
Smike
have
to
be
present
also
.
 
<EOS>
and
Miss
La
Creevy
be
very
kind
too
,
and
wonderfully
talkative
:
not
to
Smike
,
for
that
would
have
make
him
uneasy
at
first
,
but
to
Nicholas
and
his
sister
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
after
a
time
,
she
would
speak
to
Smike
himself
now
and
then
,
ask
him
whether
he
be
a
judge
of
likeness
,
and
whether
he
think
that
picture
in
the
corner
be
like
herself
,
and
whether
he
do
not
think
it
would
have
look
well
if
she
have
make
herself
ten
year
young
,
and
whether
he
do
not
think
,
as
a
matter
of
general
observation
,
that
young
lady
look
well
not
only
in
picture
,
but
out
of
them
too
,
than
old
one
;
with
many
more
small
joke
and
facetious
remark
,
which
be
deliver
with
such
good
-
humour
and
merriment
,
that
Smike
think
,
within
himself
,
she
be
the
nice
lady
he
have
ever
see
;
even
nicer
than
Mrs
Grudden
,
of
Mr
Vincent
Crummles
's
theatre
;
and
she
be
a
nice
lady
too
,
and
talk
,
perhaps
more
,
but
certainly
louder
,
than
Miss
La
Creevy
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
the
door
open
again
,
and
a
lady
in
mourning
come
in
;
and
Nicholas
kiss
the
lady
in
mourn
affectionately
,
and
call
her
his
mother
,
lead
her
towards
the
chair
from
which
Smike
have
rise
when
she
enter
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

always
kind
-
hearted
,
and
anxious

help
the
oppress

my

mother

say
Nicholas
,
"
<EOS>
so
you
will
be
favourably
disposed
towards
him
,
I
know

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
my
dear
Nicholas

"
reply
Mrs
Nickleby
,
look
very
hard
at
her
new
friend
,
and
bend
to
him
with
something
more
of
majesty
than
the
occasion
seem
to
require
:
"
I
be
sure
any
friend
of
yours
have
,
as
indeed
he
naturally
ought
to
have
,
and
must
have
,
of
course
,
you
know
,
a
great
claim
upon
me
,
and
of
course
,
it
be
a
very
great
pleasure
to
me
to
be
introduce
to
anybody
you
take
an
interest
in
.
 
<EOS>
there
can
he
no
doubt
about
that
;
none
at
all
;
not
the
least
in
the
world
,
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
the
same
time
I
must
say
,
Nicholas
,
my
dear
,
as
I
use
to
say
to
your
poor
dear
papa
,
when
he
WOULD
bring
gentleman
home
to
dinner
,
and
there
be
nothing
in
the
house
,
that
if
he
have
come
the
day
before
yesterday
---
no
,
I
do
not
mean
the
day
before
yesterday
now
<EOS>
;
I
should
have
say
,
perhaps
,
the
year
before
last
---
we
should
have
be
better
able
to
entertain
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
which
remark
,
Mrs
Nickleby
turn
to
her
daughter
,
and
inquire
,
in
an
audible
whisper
,
whether
the
gentleman
be
go
to
stop
all
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
because
,
if
he
be

Kate

my

say
Mrs
Nickleby
,
"
I
do
not
see
that
it
be
possible
for
him
to
sleep
anywhere
,
and
that
be
the
truth
.

"
   
<EOS>
Kate
step
gracefully
forward
,
and
without
any
show
of
annoyance
or
irritation
,
breathe
a
few
word
into
her
mother
's
ear

You

the

do
you
suppose

really

I

I
always

twice

year

Hawkinses
at
Taunton
Vale

they
be
much
rich
than
the
Grimbles
,

connect
with

in
marriage

<EOS>
so
you
see
it
be
not
so
very
unlikely
,
after
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
have
put
down
Nicholas
in
this
triumphant
manner
,
Mrs
Nickleby
be
suddenly
seize
with
a
forgetfulness
of
Smike
's
real
name
,
and
an
irresistible
tendency
to
call
him
Mr
Slammons
;
which
circumstance
she
attribute
to
the
remarkable
similarity
of
the
two
name
in
point
of
sound
both
begin
with
an
s

and
moreover
be
spelt
with
an
m.

but
whatever
doubt
there
may
be
on
this
point

there
be
none
as
to
his
be
a
most
excellent
listener
;
which
circumstance
have
considerable
influence
in
place
them
on
the
very
good
term
,
and
induce
Mrs
Nickleby
to
express
the
high
opinion
of
his
general
deportment
and
disposition
.
   
<EOS>
thus
,
the
little
circle
remain
,
on
the
most
amicable
and
agreeable
footing
,
until
the
Monday
morning
,
when
Nicholas
withdraw
himself
from
it
for
a
short
time
,
seriously
to
reflect
upon
the
state
of
his
affair
,
and
to
determine
,
if
he
could
,
upon
some
course
of
life
,
which
would
enable
him
to
support
those
who
be
so
entirely
dependent
upon
his
exertion
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crummles
occur
to
him
more
than
once
;
but
although
Kate
be
acquaint
with
the
whole
history
of
his
connection
with
that
gentleman
,
his
mother
be
not
;
and
he
foresee
a
thousand
fretful
objection
,
on
her
part
,
to
his
seek
a
livelihood
upon
the
stage
.
<EOS>
there
be
graver
reason
,
too
,
against
his
return
to
that
mode
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
independently
of
those
arise
out
of
its
spare
and
precarious
earning
,
and
his
own
internal
conviction
that
he
could
never
hope
to
aspire
to
any
great
distinction
,
even
as
a
provincial
actor
,
how
could
he
carry
his
sister
from
town
to
town
,
and
place
to
place
,
and
debar
her
from
any
other
associate
than
those
with
whom
he
would
be
compel
,
almost
without
distinction
,
to
mingle
?
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
do
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
shake
his
head
;
"
I
must
try
something
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
much
easy
to
make
this
resolution
than
to
carry
it
into
effect
.
 
<EOS>
with
no
great
experience
of
the
world
than
he
have
acquire
for
himself
in
his
short
trial
;
with
a
sufficient
share
of
headlong
rashness
and
precipitation
(
quality
not
altogether
unnatural
at
his
time
of
life
)
;
with
a
very
slend
stock
of
money
,
and
a
still
more
scanty
stock
of
friend
;
what
could
he
do
?
 
<EOS>
"
egad
!
"
say
Nicholas
,
"
I
will
try
that
Register
Office
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
smile
at
himself
as
he
walk
away
with
a
quick
step
;
for
,
an
instant
before
,
he
have
be
internally
blame
his
own
precipitation
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
laugh
himself
out
of
the
intention
,
however
,
for
on
he
go
:
picture
to
himself
,
as
he
approach
the
place
,
all
kind
of
splendid
possibility
,
and
impossibilitie
too
,
for
that
matter
,
and
think
himself
,
perhaps
with
good
reason
,
very
fortunate
to
be
endow
with
so
buoyant
and
sanguine
a
temperament
.
   
<EOS>
the
office
look
just
the
same
as
when
he
have
leave
it
last
,
and
,
indeed
,
with
one
or
two
exception
,
there
seem
to
be
the
very
same
placard
in
the
window
that
he
have
see
before
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
same
unimpeachable
master
and
mistress
in
want
of
virtuous
servant
,
and
the
same
virtuous
servant
in
want
of
unimpeachable
master
and
mistress
,
and
the
same
magnificent
estate
for
the
investment
of
capital
,
and
the
same
enormous
quantity
of
capital
to
be
invest
in
estate
,
and
,
in
short
,
the
same
opportunity
of
all
sort
for
people
who
want
to
make
their
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
and
a
most
extraordinary
proof
<EOS>
it
be
of
the
national
prosperity
,
that
people
have
not
be
find
to
avail
themselves
of
such
advantage
long
ago
.
   
<EOS>
as
Nicholas
stop
to
look
in
at
the
window
,
an
old
gentleman
happen
to
stop
too
;
and
Nicholas
,
carry
his
eye
along
the
window
-
pane
from
leave
to
right
in
search
of
some
capital
-
text
placard
which
should
be
applicable
to
his
own
case
,
catch
sight
of
this
old
gentleman
's
figure
,
and
instinctively
withdraw
his
eye
from
the
window
,
to
observe
the
same
more
closely
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
a
sturdy
old
fellow
in
a
broad
-
skirt
blue
coat
,
make
pretty
large
,
to
fit
easily
,
and
with
no
particular
waist
;
his
bulky
leg
clothe
in
drab
breech
and
high
gaiter
,
and
his
head
protect
by
a
low
-
crown
broad
-
brim
white
hat
,
such
as
a
wealthy
grazier
may
wear
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
his
coat
button
;
and
his
dimple
double
chin
rest
in
the
fold
of
a
white
neckerchief
---
not
one
of
your
stiff
-
starched
apoplectic
cravat
,
but
a
good
,
easy
,
old
-
fashioned
white
neckcloth
that
a
man
may
go
to
bed
in
and
be
none
the
bad
for
.
<EOS>
but
what
principally
attract
the
attention
of
Nicholas
be
the
old
gentleman
's
eye
,
---
never
be
such
a
clear
,
twinkling
,
honest
,
merry
,
happy
eye
,
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
he
stand
,
look
a
little
upward
,
with
one
hand
thrust
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
,
and
the
other
playing
with
his
old
-
fashioned
gold
watch
-
chain
:
his
head
throw
a
little
on
one
side
,
and
his
hat
a
little
more
on
one
side
than
his
head
,
(
but
that
be
evidently
accident
;
not
his
ordinary
way
of
wear
it
,
)
with
such
a
pleasant
smile
play
about
his
mouth
,
and
such
a
comical
expression
of
mingle
slyness
,
simplicity
,
kind
-
heartedness
,
and
good
-
humour
,
light
up
his
jolly
old
face
,
that
Nicholas
would
have
be
content
to
have
stand
there
and
look
at
him
until
evening
,
and
to
have
forget
,
meanwhile
,
that
there
be
such
a
thing
as
a
soured
mind
or
a
crab
countenance
to
be
meet
with
in
the
whole
wide
world
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
even
a
very
remote
approach
to
this
gratification
be
not
to
be
make
,
for
<EOS>
although
he
seem
quite
unconscious
of
have
be
the
subject
of
observation
,
he
look
casually
at
Nicholas
;
and
the
latter
,
fearful
of
give
offence
,
resume
his
scrutiny
of
the
window
instantly
.
   
<EOS>
still
,
the
old
gentleman
stand
there
,
glance
from
placard
to
placard
,
and
Nicholas
could
not
forbear
raise
his
eye
to
his
face
again
.
 
<EOS>
graft
upon
the
quaintness
and
oddity
of
his
appearance
,
be
something
so
indescribably
engage
,
and
bespeak
so
much
worth
,
and
there
be
so
many
little
light
hover
about
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
eye
,
that
it
be
not
a
mere
amusement
,
but
a
positive
pleasure
and
delight
to
look
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
,
it
be
no
wonder
that
the
old
man
catch
Nicholas
in
the
fact
,
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
at
such
time
,
Nicholas
colour
and
look
embarrassed
:
for
the
truth
be
,
that
he
have
begin
to
wonder
whether
the
stranger
could
,
by
any
possibility
,
be
look
for
a
clerk
or
secretary
;
and
think
this
<EOS>
,
he
feel
as
if
the
old
gentleman
must
know
it
.
   
<EOS>
long
as
all
this
take
to
tell
,
it
be
not
more
than
a
couple
of
minute
in
passing
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
stranger
be
move
away
,
Nicholas
catch
his
eye
again
,
and
,
in
the
awkwardness
of
the
moment
,
stammer
out
an
apology
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
offence
.
 
<EOS>
oh
no
offence
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
say
in
such
a
hearty
tone
,
and
the
voice
be
<EOS>
so
exactly
what
it
should
have
be
from
such
a
speaker
,
and
there
be
such
a
cordiality
in
the
manner
,
that
Nicholas
be
embolden
to
speak
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
great
many
opportunity
here
,
sir
,
"
he
say
,
half
smile
as
he
motion
towards
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
great
many
people
willing
and
anxious
to
be
employ
have
seriously
think
so
very
often
,
I
dare
say
,
"
reply
the
old
man
.
"
<EOS>
poor
fellow
,
poor
fellow
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
move
away
as
he
say
this
;
but
see
that
Nicholas
be
about
to
speak
,
good
-
naturedly
slacken
his
pace
,
as
if
he
be
unwilling
to
cut
him
short
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
little
of
that
hesitation
which
may
be
sometimes
observe
between
two
people
in
the
street
who
have
exchange
a
nod
,
and
be
both
uncertain
whether
they
shall
turn
back
and
speak
,
or
not
,
Nicholas
find
himself
at
the
old
man
's
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
about
to
speak
,
young
gentleman
;
what
be
you
go
to
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
merely
that
I
almost
hope

I
mean
to

have
some
object

Nicholas

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
what

return
the
old
man
,
look
slyly
at
Nicholas

<EOS>
"
do
you
think
I
want
a
situation
now

do

Nicholas
shake
his

"

laugh
the
old
gentleman
,
rub
his

wrist
as

them

It
be
sufficient
to
state
,
in
brief
,
that
Mr

punctual
to
his

that

oddity

he
report
strongly

next

he

that
if

<EOS>

for

We

where
be

for

my

"
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
say
something
,
brother
Ned
,
"
suggest
the
other
,
mildly
;

it
would
help
to
preserve
habit
of
frugality

you
know

and
remove
any
painful
sense

overwhelming
obligation

<EOS>
We
may
say
fifteen
pound
,

twenty
pound
,
and
if
it
be
punctually
pay
,
make
it
up
to
them
in
some
other
way

<EOS>
and
I
may
secretly
advance
a
small
loan
towards
a
little
furniture
,
and
you
may
secretly
advance
another
small
loan
,
brother
Ned

if
we
find
them
do
well

as
we
shall
;
there
be
no

no

carefully

now

<EOS>
Brother
Ned
give
his
hand
upon
it
,

not
only
say
it
should
be
do

have
it
do
too

,
in
one
short
week

Nicholas
take
possession

Mrs
Nickleby

Kate
take
possession
of
the
house

all
be

bustle

<EOS>
there
surely
never
be
such
a
week
of
discovery
and
surprise
as
the
first
week
of
that
cottage

<EOS>
every
night
when
Nicholas
come
home

something
new

one
day
it
be
a
grapevine

another

it

another
day
it
be

the
front

parlour
closet
at
the
bottom
of
the
water

butt

so

elegant

such
improvement

as

come
out

stop
a
day

two

perpetually

a
very
small
brown

paper
parcel
of
tin
tack

very
large
hammer
,
and
run
about
with
her
sleeve
tuck
up
at
the
wrist

and
fall
off
pair

hurt
herself
very
much

Mrs

who
talk
incessantly

not

It
may

o'clock

Square

Mr

send
out
for

of
the
cheap
white
kid
glove

those
at
fourteen

penny

door
knocker
therein

<EOS>
have
execute
this
task
with
great
nicety

Mr
Kenwigs
pull
the
door
to
,
after
him

and
just
step
across
the
road
to
try
the
effect
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
satisfied
that
nothing
could
possibly
look
well
in
its
way
,
Mr
Kenwigs
then
step
back
again
,
and
call
through
the
keyhole
to
Morleena
to
open
the
door
,
vanish
into
the
house
,
and
be
see
no
longer
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
consider
as
an
abstract
circumstance
,
there
be
no
more
obvious
cause
or
reason
why
Mr
Kenwigs
should
take
the
trouble
of
muffle
this
particular
knocker
,
than
there
would
have
be
for
his
muffling
the
knocker
of
any
nobleman
or
gentleman
resident
ten
mile
off
;
because
,
for
the
great
convenience
of
the
numerous
lodger
,
the
street
-
door
always
stand
wide
open
,
and
the
knocker
be
never
use
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
first

,
the
second
floor
,
and
the
third

have
each
a
bell
of
its
own
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
attic
,
no
one
ever
call
on
them
;
if
anybody
want
the
parlour
,
they
be
close
at
hand
,
and
all
he
have
to
do
be
to
walk
straight
into
them
;
while
the
kitchen
have
a
separate
entrance
down
the
area
step
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
question
of
mere
necessity
and
usefulness
,
therefore
,
this
muffling
of
the
knocker
be
thoroughly
incomprehensible
.
   
<EOS>
but
knocker
may
be
muffle
for
other
purpose
than
those
of
mere
utilitarianism
,
as
,
in
the
present
instance
,
be
clearly
show
.
<EOS>
there
be
certain
polite
form
and
ceremony
which
must
be
observe
in
civilised
life
,
or
mankind
relapse
into
their
original
barbarism

<EOS>
no
genteel

indeed

no
genteel
confinement
can
possibly

Mr

ponder
upon
the
advisability
of
this
step
,
and
the
sensation
it
be
likely
to
create
in
the
neighbourhood
,
Mr
Kenwigs
betake
himself
to
the
sitting
-
room
,
where
various
extremely
diminutive
article
of
clothing
be
air
on
a
horse
before
the
fire

Mr
Lumbey
,
the
doctor

be
dandle

that
is

the

not
the

"
It

Mr

I
never

such
a

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
pleasant
thing
to
reflect
upon
,
and
furnish
a
complete
answer
to
those
who
contend
for
the
gradual
degeneration
of
the
human
specie
,
that
every

bear
into
the
world
be
a
fine
one

I
ne

such
a

the

"
Morleena

Mr

;
as
if
this
be
rather
an
attack

by
implication

upon
the
family

"
They

he
could
best
charge
the
nursing
in

<EOS>
during

short
conversation

Miss

have
be
hustle

slap
the
three
young
Miss

without
intermission
;
which
considerate

affectionate
conduct
bring
tear
into

that

<EOS>
all
this
time
there
have

a
great
whisking
in

out
of
the
other
room
;
the
door
have
be
open
and
shut
very
softly
about
twenty
time
a
minute
(
for
it
be
necessary
to
keep
Mrs
Kenwigs
quiet
)
;
and
the
baby
have
be
exhibit
to
a
score
or
two
of
deputation
from
a
select
body
of
female
friend

who
have
assemble
in
the
passage

and
about
the
street
-
door
,
to
discuss
the
event
in
all
its
bearing

<EOS>
indeed
,
the
excitement
extend
itself
over
the
whole
street
,
and
group
of
lady
may
be
see
stand
at
the
door
,
(
some
in
the
interesting
condition
in
which
Mrs

have
last
appear
in
public

relate
their
experience
of
similar
occurrence

<EOS>
some
few
acquire
great
credit
from
have
prophesy

the
day
before
yesterday

exactly
when
it
would
come
to
pass
;
other

relate

how
that
they
guess
what
it
be

directly
they
see
Mr

turn
pale

run
up
the
street
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
go

<EOS>
some
say
one
thing
,
and
some
another
;
but
all
talk
together
,
and
all
agree
upon
two
point
:
first
,
that
it
be
very
meritorious
and
highly
praiseworthy
in
Mrs
Kenwigs
to
do
as
she
have
do
:
and
secondly
,
that
there
never
be
such
a
skilful
and
scientific
doctor
as
that
Dr
Lumbey
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
general
hubbub
,
Dr

in
the
first

floor
front
,
as
before
relate
,
nurse

talk
to
Mr

<EOS>
He
be
a
stout
bluff

look
gentleman
,
with
no
shirt
-
collar
to
speak
of
,
and
a
beard
that
have
be
grow
since
yesterday
morning
;
for
Dr
Lumbey
be
popular
,
and
the
neighbourhood
be
prolific
;
and
there
have
be
no
less
than
three
other
knocker
muffle

one
after
the
other
within
the
last
forty

eight

"

with
this

half
as
much
as

,
who
have
just
come
in
from
the
sick
chamber
to
report
progress
,
and
take
a
small
sip
of
brandy

and

water

who
seem
to
consider
it
one
of
the
good
joke

upon

"
They

It

such

leisurely
at

with
a
smile
upon

actually
a
smile

there
be
no
mistake
about
it
;
Mr

often
mention
it
afterwards

Nicholas
dip
his

caution

unable

that
,
exactly
thirty
-
five
year
ago
,
Tim
Linkinwater

suspect
to
have
receive
a
love

letter
,
and
how
that
vague
information
have
be
bring
to
the
counting
-
house
of
his
have
be
see
walk
down
Cheapside
with
an
uncommonly
handsome
spinster
;
at
which
there
be
a
roar
of
laughter
,
and
Tim
Linkinwater
be
charge
with
blush
,
and
call
upon
to
explain
,
deny
that
the
accusation
be
true
;
and
further
,
that
there
would
have
be
any
harm
in
it
if
it
have
be
;
which
last
position
occasion
the
superannuated
bank
clerk
to
laugh
tremendously
,
and
to
declare
that
it
be
the
very
good
thing
he
have
ever
hear
in
his
life
,
and
that
Tim
Linkinwater
may
say
a
great
many
thing
before
he
say
anything
which
would
beat
that
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
one
little
ceremony
peculiar
to
the
day
,
both
the
matter
and
manner
of
which
make
a
very
strong
impression
upon
Nicholas

the

and
the
decanter
send
round
for
the
first
time
,
a
profound
silence
succeed
,
and
in
the
cheerful
face
of
the
brother
there
appear
an
expression
,
not
of
absolute
melancholy
,
but
of
quiet
thoughtfulness
very
unusual
at
a
festive
table
.
 
<EOS>
as
Nicholas
,
strike
by
this
sudden
alteration
,
be
wonder
what
it
could
portend
,
the
brother
rise
together
,
and
the
one
at
the
top
of
the
table
lean
forward
towards
the
other
,
and
speak
in
a
low
voice
as

<EOS>
with
this
singular
contradiction
of
term
,
brother
Ned
give
Tim
Linkinwater
a
slap
on
the
back
,
which
make
him
look
,
for
the
moment
,
almost
as
apoplectic
as
the
butler
:
and
toss
off
the
content
of
his
glass
in
a
twinkling

<EOS>
the
toast
be
scarcely
drunk
with
all
honour
to
Tim

when

sturdy

jolliest

himself
a
little
in

a
very
hot
and
flushed
countenance

pull
a
single
lock

grey
hair
in

forehead
as
a
respectful
salute

deliver
himself
as

rub
the
palm
of
his

very
hard
on
a

cotton
handkerchief

We

pause

"
   
<EOS>
when
the
foregoing
speech
be
over
---
and
it
may
have
be
much
more
elegant
and
much
less
to
the
purpose
---
the
whole
body
of
subordinate
under
command
of
the
apoplectic
butler
give
three
soft
cheer
;
which
,
to
that
gentleman
's
great
indignation
,
be
not
very
regular
,
inasmuch
as
the
woman
persist
in
give
an
immense
number
of
little
shrill
hurrah
among
themselves
,
in
utter
disregard
of
the
time

<EOS>
this
done

they
withdraw

shortly
afterwards

in
reasonable
time
after
that
,
the
sitting
be
break
up
for
tea
and
coffee
,

a
round
game
of
card
.
   
<EOS>
at
half
-
past
ten
---
late
hour
for
the
square
---
there
appear
a
little
tray
of
sandwich
and
a
bowl
of
bishop
,
which
bishop
come
on
the
top
of
the
double
-
diamond
,
and
other
excitement
,
have
such
an
effect
upon
Tim
Linkinwater
,
that
he
draw
Nicholas
aside
,
and
give
him
to
understand
,
confidentially
,
that
it
be
quite
true
about
the
uncommonly
handsome
spinster
,
and
that
she
be
to
the
full
as
good
-
look
as
she
have
be
describe
---
more
so
,
indeed

but
that
she
be
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
change
her
condition
,
and
consequently
,
while
Tim
be
court
her

think
of
change
his

get
marry

somebody
else

"
after
all

I

it
be
the
most
extraordinary
accidental
likeness
you
ever
see

her
very
portrait
,
sir

"
   
<EOS>
by
this
time
it
be
past
eleven
o'clock
;
and
Tim
Linkinwater
's
sister
declare
that
she
ought
to
have
be
at
home
a
full
hour
ago
,
a
coach
be
procure

into
which
she
be
hand
with
great
ceremony
by
brother
Ned
,
while
brother
Charles
impart
the
full
direction
to
the
coachman
,
and
besides
pay
the
man
a
shilling
over
and
above
his
fare
,
in
order
that
he
may
take
the
utmost
care
of
the
lady
,
all
but
choke
him
with
a
glass
of
spirit
of
uncommon
strength
,
and
then
nearly
knock
all
the
breath
out
of
his
body
in
his
energetic
endeavour
to
knock
it
in
again
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
the
coach
rumble
off
,
and
Tim
Linkinwater
's
sister
be
now
fairly
on
her
way
home
,
<EOS>
Nicholas
and
Tim
Linkinwater
's
friend
take
their
leave
together
,
and
leave
old
Tim
and
the
worthy
brother
to
their
repose
.
   
<EOS>
as
Nicholas
have
some
distance
to
walk
,
it
be
considerably
past
midnight
by
the
time
he
reach
home
,
where
he
find
his
mother
and
Smike
sit
up
to
receive
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
long
after
their
usual
hour
of
retiring
,
and
they
have
expect
him
,
at
the
very
late
,
two
hour
ago
;
but
the
time
have
not
hang
heavily
on
their
hand
,
for
Mrs
Nickleby
have
entertain
Smike
with
a
genealogical
account
of
her
family
by
the
mother
's
side
,
comprise
biographical
sketch
of
the
principal
member
,
and
Smike
have
sit
wonder
what
it
be
all
about
,
and
whether
it
be
learn
from
a
book
,
or
say
out
of
Mrs
Nickleby
's
own
head
;
so
that
they
get
on
together
very
pleasantly
.
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
could
not
go
to
bed
without
expatiate
on
the
excellence
and
munificence
of
the
brother
cheeryble
,
and
relate
the
great
success
which
have
attend
his
effort
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
he
have
say
a
dozen
word
,
Mrs
Nickleby
,
with
many
sly
wink
and
nod
,
observe
,
that
she
be
sure
Mr
Smike
must
be
quite
tired
out
,
and
that
she
positively
must
insist
on
his
not
sit
up
a
minute
longer
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
most
biddable
creature
he
be
,
to
be
sure
,
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
,
when
Smike
have
wish
them
good
-
night
and
leave
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
will
excuse
me
,
Nicholas
,
my
dear
,
but
I
do
not
like
to
do
this
before
a
third
person
;
indeed
,
before
a
young
man
it
would
not
be
quite
proper
,
though
really
,
after
all
,
I
do
not
know
what
harm
there
be
in
it
,
except
that
to
be
sure
it
be
not
a
very
becoming
thing
,
though
some
people
say
it
be
very
much
so
,
and
really
I
do
not
know
why
it
should
not
be
,
if
it
be
well
get
up
,
and
the
border
be
small
-
plaited
;
of
course
,
a
good
deal
depend
upon
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
which
preface
,
Mrs
Nickleby
take
her
nightcap
from
between
the
leave
of
a
very
large
prayer
-
book
where
it
have
be
fold
up
small
,
and
proceed
to
tie
it
on
:
talk
away
in
her
usual
discursive
manner
,
all
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
People
may
say
what
they
like
,
"
observe
Mrs
Nickleby
,
"
but
there
be
a
great
deal
of
comfort
in
a
nightcap
,
as
I
be
sure
you
would
confess
,
Nicholas
<EOS>
my
dear
,
if
you
would
only
have
string
to
yours
,
and
wear
it
like
a
Christian
,
instead
of
stick
it
upon
the
very
top
of
your
head
like
a
blue
-
coat
boy
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
not
think
it
an
unmanly
or
quizzical
thing
to
be
particular
about
your
nightcap
,
for
I
have
often
hear
your
poor
dear
papa
,
and
the
Reverend
Mr
What's
-
his
-
name
,
who
use
to
read
prayer
in
that
old
church
with
the
curious
little
steeple
that
the
weathercock
be
blow
off
the
night
week
before
you
be
bear
,
<EOS>
---
I
have
often
hear
them
say
,
that
the
young
man
at
college
be
uncommonly
particular
about
their
nightcap
,
and
that
the
Oxford
nightcap
be
quite
celebrated
for
their
strength
and
goodness
;
so
much
so
,
indeed
,
that
the
young
man
never
dream
of
go
to
bed
without
'em
,
and
I
believe
it
be
admit
on
all
hand
that
they
know
what
be
good
,
and
do
not
coddle
themselves
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
laugh
,
and
enter
no
further
into
the
subject
of
this
lengthen
harangue
,
revert
to
the
pleasant
tone
of
the
little
birthday
party
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
Mrs
Nickleby
instantly
become
very
curious
respect
it
,
and
make
a
great
number
of
inquiry
touch
what
they
have
have
for
dinner
,
and
how
it
be
put
on
table
,
and
whether
it
be
overdone
or
underdone
,
and
who
be
there
,
and
what
"
the
Mr
Cherrybles

say
,
and
what
Nicholas
say
,
and
<EOS>
what
the
Mr

say
when
he
say
that

Nicholas
describe
the
festivity
at
full
length

the
occurrence
of
the
morning

<EOS>
"
late
as
it
be

Nicholas

"
I
be
almost
selfish
enough
to
wish
that
Kate

up

hear
all
this

I
be
all
impatience
,
as
I
come
along

to

<EOS>
"
why
,
Kate

"

Mrs
Nickleby

put
her
foot
upon
the
fender

draw
her
chair
close
to
it

as

settle
herself
for
a
long
talk

<EOS>
"
Kate
have
be
in
bed

oh
!
<EOS>
a
couple
of
hour

<EOS>

I
be
very
glad
,
Nicholas
<EOS>
my
dear
,
that
I
prevail
upon
her
not
to
sit
up
,
for
I
wish
very
much
to
have
an
opportunity
of
say
a
few
word
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
naturally
anxious
about
it
,
and
of
course
it
be
a
very
delightful
and
consoling
thing
to
have
a
grow
-
up
son
that
one
can
put
confidence
in
,
and
advise
with
;
indeed
I
do
not
know
any
use
<EOS>
there
would
be
in
have
son
at
all
,
unless
people
could
put
confidence
in
them

"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
stop
in
the
middle
of
a
sleepy
yawn
,
as
his
mother
begin
to
speak
:
and
look
at
her
with
fix
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
lady
in
our
neighbourhood

Mrs
Nickleby

put
me
in
mind
of
it

a
lady
in

neighbourhood

we
live
near

I
think
her
name
be
Rogers

indeed

sure
it
be

Murphy

be
the
only
doubt
I
have

it
about

Mrs

good
gracious
,
Nicholas

my

how
CAN
you
be
so
ridiculous

but
that
be
always
the
way
with
your
poor

just
his
way

<EOS>
always
wander
,
never
able
to
fix
his

I

I
see
him
now

Mrs
Nickleby
,
wipe
her
eye
,
"
look
at
me
while
I
be
talk
to
him
about
his
affair
,
just
as
if
his
idea
be
in
a
state
of
perfect
conglomeration
!
 
<EOS>
anybody
who
have
come
in
upon
us
suddenly
,
would
have
suppose
I
be
confuse

distract
him
instead

upon
my

they
would

<EOS>
"
I
be
very

that
I

this
unfortunate

Nicholas

kindly

I
will
do
my

late

what
I

<EOS>
this
be
undoubtedly
the
case
,
inasmuch
as
the
deceased
Mr
Nickleby
have
not
arrive
at
the
knowledge

<EOS>
then
he
die

<EOS>
neither
have
Mrs

herself

be
,
in

sort

an
explanation

the
circumstance

"
however

Mrs

dry
her
tear

this
have
nothing

certainly
nothing

<EOS>

I
should
suppose

little
to

return
Nicholas
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
can
be
no
doubt
,
"
say
Mrs

,
"
that
he
be
a
gentleman

have
the
manner
of
a
gentleman

the
appearance
of
a
gentleman

do
wear
small

grey
worst
stocking

that
may

eccentricity

he

the
Prince
Regent
be
proud

so
be
Daniel
Lambert

be
also
a
fat
man

he

proud

no

add
Mrs

correct

herself

I

she
have
only
toe

the
principle

the

"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
look
on
,
quite
amazed
at
the
introduction
of
this
new
theme

<EOS>
which
seem
just
what
Mrs

have
expect

to
be

You
may
well
be
surprised

Nicholas

my

she

,
"
I
be
sure
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
upon
me
like
a
flash
of
fire
,
and
almost
freeze
my
blood
.
 
<EOS>
the
bottom
of
his
garden
join
the
bottom
of
ours
,
and
of
course
I
have
several
time
see
him
sit
among
the
scarlet
-
bean
in
his
little
arbour
,
or
work
at
his
little
hot
-
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
think
he
stare
rather
,
but
I
do
not
take
any
particular
notice
of
that
,
as
we
be
newcomer
,
and
he
may
be
curious
to
see
what
we
be

when

his
cucumber

Nicholas

great
astonishment

yes

Mrs

serious

what
!

Nicholas
,
"
cucumber

fly
at
the
head

walk
in

impertinently

<EOS>
why
,
mother
---
"
   
Nicholas
stop
short
;
for
there
be
an
indescribable
expression
of
placid
triumph
,
mingle
with
a
modest
confusion
,
linger
between
the
border
of
Mrs
Nickleby
's
nightcap
,
which
arrest
his
attention
suddenly
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
a
very
weak
,
and
foolish
,
and
inconsiderate
man
,
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
;
"
blamable
indeed
<EOS>
---
at
least
I
suppose
other
people
would
consider
him
so
;
of
course
I
can
not
be
expect
to
express
any
opinion
on
that
point
,
especially
after
always
defend
your
poor
dear
papa
when
other
people
blame
him
for
make
proposal
to
me
;
and
to
be
sure
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
have
take
a
very
singular
way
of
show
it
.
 
<EOS>
still
at
the

time

his
attention
be

that
is
,
as
far
as
it
go
,

to
a
certain
extent
of
course

a
flattering
sort
of
thing
;

although
I
should
never
dream
of
marry
again
with
a
dear
girl
like
Kate
still
unsettle
in
life

surely

idea

his

peevish
tone

not
that
precisely
what
I
be

me
speak

course
,
I
never

it
a

I
be

astonish
that

capable

all
I

be

what
step
be
the
good
to
take

so

to
reject
these

civilly

delicately

I
be
sure
there
be
a
case
in
the
day
before
yesterday
's
paper
,
<EOS>
extract
from
one
of
the
french
newspaper
,
about
a
journeyman
shoemaker
who
be
jealous
of
a
young
girl
in
an
adjoining
village
,
because
she
would
not
shut
herself
up
in
an
air
-
tight
three
-
pair
-
of
-
stair
,
and
charcoal
herself
to
death
with
him
;
and
who
go
and
hide
himself
in
a
wood
with
a
sharp
-
point
knife
,
and
rush
out
,
as
she
be
pass
by
with
a
few
friend

kill
himself
first
,
and
then
all
the
friend
,
and
then
her
---
<EOS>
no
,
kill
all
the
friend
first
,

then
herself
,
and
then
himself

which
it
be
quite
frightful
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
somehow
or
other
,
"
add
Mrs
Nickleby
,
after
a
momentary
pause
,
"
they
always
are
journeyman
shoemaker

do
these
thing
in
France

accord
to
the
paper

I
do
not

how
it
be

something
in
the
leather

I

<EOS>
"

this
man

mother

what
have
he
say
?

"
inquire
Nicholas
,
fret
almost
beyond
endurance
,
but
look
nearly
as
resigned
and
patient
as
Mrs
Nickleby
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
there
be
no
language
of
vegetable

convert
a

into

formal
declaration

"
   
<EOS>
"
My

Mrs

,
toss
her
head

at

ashe
in

all
sort

be
there
no

Mrs

<EOS>
"
Lord
,
Nicholas

man
be
in

"
every

Mrs

"
he
kiss
one
hand
,
and
lay
the
other
upon
his
heart
<EOS>
---
of
course
it
be
very
foolish
of
him
to
do
so
,
and
I
dare
say
you
will
say
it
be
very
wrong

but
he
do
it
very
respectfully

very
respectfully
indeed

very
tenderly
,
extremely
tenderly
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
,
he
deserve
the
great
credit

there
can
be
no

about
that

<EOS>
then
,
there
be
the
present
which
come
pour
over
the
wall
every
day
,
and
very
fine
they
certainly
be
,
very
fine
;
we
have
one
of
the
cucumber
at
dinner
yesterday
,
and
think
of
pickle
the
rest
for
next
winter

<EOS>
and
last
evening
,
"
add
Mrs
Nickleby
,
with
increase
confusion
,
"
he
call
gently
over
the
wall
,
as
I
be
walk
in
the
garden
,
and
propose
marriage
,
and
an
elopement

<EOS>
His
voice
be
as
clear
as
a
bell
or
a
musical
glass

very
like
a
musical
glass
indeed

<EOS>
but
of
course
I
do
not
listen
to
it

<EOS>
then
,
the
question
be

Nicholas
my

what
be
I
to
do

do
Kate
know

<EOS>
"
I
have
not

a
word
about
it
yet

"
answer
his
mother

<EOS>
"
then
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
"
rejoin
Nicholas
,
rise
,
"
do
not
,
for
it
would
make
her
very
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
and
with
regard
to
what
you
should
do
,
my
dear
mother
,
do
what
your
good
sense
and
feeling
,
and
respect
for
my
father
's
memory
,
would
prompt
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
thousand
way
in
which
you
can
show
your
dislike
of
these
preposterous
and
dote
attention
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
act
as
decidedly
as
you
ought
<EOS>
and
they
be
still
continue
,
and
to
your
annoyance
,
I
can
speedily
put
a
stop
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
I
should
not
interfere
in
a
matter
so
ridiculous
,
and
attach
importance
to
it
,
until
you
have
vindicate
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Most
woman
can
do
that
,
but
especially
one
of
your
age
and
condition
,
in
circumstance
like
these
,
which
be
unworthy
of
a
serious
thought
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
shame
you
by
seem
to
take
them
to
heart
,
or
treat
them
earnestly
for
an
instant

<EOS>
absurd
old
idiot
!

<EOS>
so
say
,
Nicholas
kiss
his
mother
,
and
bade
her
good
-
night
,
and
they
retire
to
their
respective
chamber
.
   
<EOS>
to
do
Mrs
Nickleby
justice
,
her
attachment
to
her
child
would
have
prevent
her
seriously
contemplate
a
second
marriage
,
even
if
she
could
have
so
far
conquer
her
recollection
of
her
late
husband
as
to
have
any
strong
inclination
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
although
there
be
no
evil
and
little
real
selfishness
in
Mrs
Nickleby
's
heart
,
she
have
a
weak
head
and
a
vain
one
;
and
there
be
something
so
flattering
in
be
seek
(
and
vainly
seek
)
in
marriage
at
this
time
of
day
,
that
she
could
not
dismiss
the
passion
of
the
unknown
gentleman
quite
so
summarily
or
lightly
as
Nicholas
appear
to
deem
become
.
   
<EOS>
"

as
to
its

ridiculous

commune
with
herself
in
her
own
room
,
"
I
do
not
see
that
,
at
all

<EOS>
It
be
hopeless
on
his
part

certainly
;
but
why
he
should
be
an
absurd
old
idiot
<EOS>
,
I
confess
I
do
not
see

<EOS>
He
be
not

hopeless

<EOS>
poor
fellow

<EOS>
He
be
to
be

I

have
make

reflection

to
his
House

will
take
no

<EOS>

as

for
he
will
not

N-

no

perhaps
not

exactly
,

say
Miss

,
pause
to
consider

although
he
be
a
worn
and
feeble
creature

have
that

wring

no

<EOS>
"
how
then
?
"
   
"
I
scarcely
know

say
the
miniature
painter

<EOS>

but
I
have
watch
him
,
and
he
have
bring
the
tear
into
my
eye
many
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
very
difficult
matter
to
do
that
,
certainly
,
for
I
be
easily
melted
;
still
I
think
these
come
with
good
cause
and
reason
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
that
since
he
have
be
here
,
he
have
grow
,
from
some
strong
cause
,
more
conscious
of
his
weak
intellect
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
it
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
give
him
great
pain
to
know
that
he
wander
sometimes
,
and
can
not
understand
very
simple
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
watch
him
when
you
have
not
be
by
,
my
dear
,
<EOS>
sit
brooding
by
himself
,
with
such
a
look
of
pain
as
I
could
scarcely
bear
to
see
,
and
then
get
up
and
leave
the
room
:
<EOS>
so
sorrowfully
,
and
in
such
dejection
,
that
I
can
not
tell
you
how
it
have
hurt
me
.
 
<EOS>
not
three
week
ago
,
he
be
a
light
-
hearted
busy
creature
,
overjoy
to
be
in
a
bustle
,
and
as
happy
as
the
day
be
long
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
he
be
another
being
---
the
same
willing
,
harmless
,
faithful
,
love
creature
---
but
the
same
in
nothing
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
surely
this
will
all
pass
off

say
Kate

"
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!

"
   
<EOS>

I
hope

return
her

gravity
very
unusual
in

it
may

<EOS>
I
hope
,
for
the
sake
of
that
poor
lad
,
it
may
.
<EOS>
however
,
"
say
Miss
La
Creevy
,
relapse
into
the
cheerful
,
chatter
tone
,
which
be
habitual
to
her
,
"
I
have
say
my
say
,
and
a
very
long
say
it
be
,
and
a
very
wrong
say
too
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
wonder
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
cheer
him
up
tonight
,
at
all
event
,
for
if
he
be
to
be
my
squire
all
the
way
to
the
Strand
,
I
shall
talk
on
,
and
on
,
and
on
,
and
never
leave
off
,
till
I
have
rouse
him
into
a
laugh
at
something
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
sooner
he
go
,
the
well
for
him
,
and
the
sooner
I
go
,
the
well
for
me
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
or
else
I
shall
have
my
maid
gallivant
with
somebody
who
may
rob
the
house
---
<EOS>
though
what
there
be
to
take
away
,
besides
table
and
chair
,
I
do
not
know
,
except
the
miniature
:
and
he
be
a
clever
thief
who
can
dispose
of
them
to
any
great
advantage
,
for
I
can
not
,
I
know
,
and
that
be
the
honest
truth
.

<EOS>
so
say
,
little
Miss
La
Creevy
hide
her
face
in
a
very
flat
bonnet
,
and
herself
in
a
very
big
shawl

fix
herself
tightly

mean
of
a
large

declare

considerable
time

this
ceremony

of
course

be

by
a
second

Mr

the
monotonous
murmur

their
conversation
with
a
half

smothered
laugh
,
while

sit
beside
his
Mentor

with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth

and
read
to
him

by
the
light
of

such
scrap

Messrs

hear
the
exclamation
,

stop
immediately
:
wink
to
each
other

do
so

fill
their

how
warily

coolly

His
address

the
gentle
consideration

there

take
up

his
threat

almost
as
ferociously

Lord

out
of

room

leave

in
most
unpleasant
astonishment

be
this
your

"
green

bite
his

point
to
the
door

<EOS>
"
leave
him
to
me

<EOS>
Ralph
exchange
a
familiar
look
with
his
old
acquaintance
;
for
they
have
suddenly
grow
confidential
again
in
this
alarming
surprise
;
and
take
his
way
home
,
thoughtfully
and
slowly
.
   
<EOS>
while
these

be
be

long
before

the
omnibus
have
disgorge
Miss
La
Creevy

her
escort

they
have
arrive
at
her
own
door

<EOS>
now
,
the
good

nature
of
the
little
miniature
painter

by
no

allow

back
again

have
be
previously
refresh
with
just
a
sip
of
something
comfortable

so
;
and
Smike
,
entertain
no
objection
either
to
the
sip
of
something
comfortable
,
or
the
mixed
biscuit
,
but
,
consider
on
the
contrary
that
they
would
be
a
very
pleasant
preparation
for
a
walk
to
Bow
,
it
fall
out
that
he
delay
much
longer
than
he
originally
intend
,
and
that
it
be
some
half
-
hour
after
dusk
when
he
set
forth
on
his
journey
home
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
likelihood
of

lose
his

for
it
lie
quite
straight

walk
into
town
with
Nicholas

back
alone

almost
every
day

so

Miss

mutual
confidence

more
kind
remembrance

<EOS>
but
no
threat
or
cuff
could
elicit
from
Smike
one
word
of
reply
to
this
question
;
for
he
have
internally
resolve
that
he
would
rather
perish
in
the
wretched
prison
to
which
he
be
again
about
to
be
consign
,
than
utter
one
syllable
which
could
involve
his
first
and
true
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
already
call
to
mind
the
strict
injunction
of
secrecy
as
to
his
past
life
,
which
Nicholas
have
lay
upon
him
when
they
travel
from
Yorkshire
;
and
a
confused
and
perplex
idea
that
his
benefactor
may
have
commit
some
terrible
crime
in
bring
him
away
,
which
would
render
him
liable
to
heavy
punishment
if
detect
,
have
contribute
,
in
some
degree
,
to
reduce
him
to
his
present
state
of
apathy
and
terror
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
the
thought
---
if
to
vision
<EOS>
so
imperfect
and
undefined
as
those
which
wander
through
his
enfeeble
brain
,
the
term
can
be
apply
---
which
be
present
to
the
mind
of
Smike
,
and
render
him
deaf
alike
to
intimidation
and
persuasion
.
 
<EOS>
find
every
effort
useless
,
Mr
Squeers
conduct
him
to
a
little
back
room
up
-
stair
,
where
he
be
to
pass
the
night
;
and
,
take
the
precaution
of
remove
his
shoe
,
and
coat
and
waistcoat
,
and
also
of
lock
the
door
on
the
outside
,
lest
he
should
muster
up
sufficient
energy
to
make
an
attempt
at
escape
,
that
worthy
gentleman
leave
him
to
his
meditation
.
   
<EOS>
what
those
meditation
be
,
and
how
the
poor
creature
's
heart
sink
within
him
when
he
think
---
when
do
he
,
for
a
moment
,
cease
to
think
?
<EOS>
---
of
his
late
home
,
and
the
dear
friend
and
familiar
face
with
which
it
be
associate
,
can
not
be
tell
.
<EOS>
to
prepare
the
mind
for
such
a
heavy
sleep
,
its
growth
must
be
stop
by
rigour
and
cruelty
in
childhood
;
there
must
be
year
of
misery
and
suffering
,
lighten
by
no
ray
of
hope
;
the
chord
of
the
heart
,
which
beat
a
quick
response
to
the
voice
of
gentleness
and
affection
,
must
have
rust
and
break
in
their
secret
place
,
and
bear
the
linger
echo
of
no
old
word
of
love
or
kindness
.
<EOS>
Gloomy
,
indeed
,
must
have
be
the
short
day
,
and
dull
the
long
,
long
twilight
,
precede
such
a
night
of
intellect
as
his
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
voice
which
would
have
rouse
him
,
even
then
;
but
their
welcome
tone
could
not
penetrate
there
;
and
he
creep
to
bed
the
same
listless
,
hopeless
,
blighted
creature
,
that
Nicholas

first

him
at

John

only
reply
be
another
squeeze
of

an
assurance

they
would

London
till
tomorrow
,
so
that
they
may
be
at
Mr

at
six
o'clock
without
fail

further
conversation

a
very
odd
and
excitable
state

burst
occasionally
into
an
explosion
of
laughter
,
and
then
take
up
his
hat
and
run
into
the
coach

yard
to
have
it
out
by
himself

<EOS>
He

very
restless

in

out
,
and
snap
his
finger
,
and
dance
scrap
of
uncouth
country
dance
,
and
,
in

,
conduct
himself
in
such
a
very
extraordinary
manner

that
Miss

go
mad

her
suspicion

many

<EOS>
Mrs

,
however
,
without
discover
any
great
alarm
,
observe
that
she
have
see
him
<EOS>
so
once
before
,
and
that
although
he
be
almost
sure
to
be
ill
after
it
,
it
would
not
be
anything
very
serious
,
and
therefore
he
be
better
leave
alone
.
   
<EOS>
the
result
prove
her
to
be
perfectly
correct
for
,
while
they

consternation

His
good

to
lie
down
on
Mr
Squeers
's
bed
for
an
hour
or
so
,
and
leave
entirely
to
himself

he
would
be
sure
to
recover
again
almost
as
quickly
as
he
have

Success

in

solitary
Particular
 
once
more
out

it

forth
the

and
exertion
that

be
capable

to
his

<EOS>
without
pause
for
a
moment
to
reflect
upon
the
course
he
be
take
,
or
the
probability
of
its
lead

homeward

he
flee

constancy

bear
upon
such
wing
as
only
fear
can
wear

and
impel
by
imaginary
shout
in

well
remember
voice
of

with
a
host
of
pursuer
,
seem

the
poor

press
hard
upon
his
track
;
now
leave
at
a
great
distance
in

and
now
gain
faster
and
faster
upon
him
,
as
the
alternation
of
hope
and
terror
agitate
him
by
turn
.
 
<EOS>
long
after
he
have
become
assure
that
these
sound
be

the
creation
of
his
excited
brain
,
he
still
hold
on
,
at
a
pace
which
even
weakness
and
exhaustion
could
scarcely
retard
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
the
darkness
and
quiet
of
a
country
road
,
recall
him
to
a
sense
of
external
object
,
and
the
starry
sky
,
above
,
warn
him
of
the
rapid
flight
of
time
,
that
,
cover
with
dust
and
pant
for
breath
,
he
stop
to
listen
and
look
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
all
be
still
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
a
glare
of
light
in
the

,
cast
a
warm
glow
upon
the

where

<EOS>
solitary
field
,
divide
by
hedge

through
many
of

he
have
crash

scramble
in
his
flight

skirt
the
road
,
both
by
the
way
he
have
come
and
upon
the
opposite
side

<EOS>
It
be
late
now
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
scarcely
trace
him
by
such
path
as
he
have
take
,
and
if
he
could
hope
to
regain
his
own
dwelling
,
it
must
surely
be
at
such
a
time
as
that
,
and
under
cover
of
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
by
degree
,
become
pretty
plain
,
even
to
the
mind
of
Smike
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
,
at
first
,
entertain
some
vague
and
childish
idea
of
travel
into
the
country
for
ten
or
a
dozen
mile
,
and
then
return
homeward
by
a
wide
circuit
,
which
should
keep
him
clear
of
London
---
so
great
be
his
apprehension
of
traverse
the
street
alone
,
lest
he
should
again
encounter
his
dread
enemy
---
but
,
yield
to
the
conviction
which
these
thought
inspire
,
he
turn
back
,
and
take
the
open
road
,
though
not
without
many
fear
and
misgiving
,
make
for
London
again
,
with
scarcely
less
speed
of
foot
than
that
with
which
he
have
leave
the
temporary
abode
of
Mr
Squeers
.
   
<EOS>
by
the
time
he
re
-
enter
it
,
at
the
western
extremity
,
the
great
part
of
the
shop
be
close
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
throng
of
people
who
have
be
tempt
abroad
after
the
heat
of
the
day
,
but
few
remain
in
the
street
,
and
they
be
lounge
home
.
 
<EOS>
but
of
these
he
ask
his
way
from
time
to
time
,
and
by
dint
of
repeat
inquiry
,
he
at
length
reach
the
dwelling
of
Newman
Noggs
.
   
<EOS>
all
that
evening
,
Newman
have
be
hunt
and
search
in
byway
and
corner
for
the
very
person
who
now
knock
at
his
door
,
while
Nicholas
have
be
pursue
the
same
inquiry
in
other
direction
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sit
,
with
a
melancholy
air
,
at
his
poor
supper
,
when
Smike
's
timorous
and
uncertain
knock
reach
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
alive
to
every
sound
,
in
his
anxious
and
expectant
state
,
Newman
hurry
downstairs
,
and
,
utter
a
cry
of
joyful
surprise
,
drag
the
welcome
visitor
into
the
passage
and
up
the
stair
,
and
say
not
a
word
until
he
have
him
safe
in
his
own
garret
and
the
door
be
shut
behind
them
,
when
he
mix
a
great
mug
-
full
of
gin
-
and
-
water
,
and
hold
it
to
Smike
's
mouth
,
as
one
may
hold
a
bowl
of
medicine
to
the
lip
of
a
refractory
child
,
command
him
to
drain
it
to
the
last
drop
.
   
<EOS>
Newman
look
uncommonly
blank
when
he
find
that
Smike
do
little
more
than
put
his
lip
to
the
precious
mixture
;
he
be
in
the
act
of
raise
the
mug
to
his
own
mouth
with
a
deep
sigh
of
compassion
for
his
poor
friend
's
weakness
,
when
Smike
,
begin
to
relate
the
adventure
which
have
befall
him
,
arrest
him
half
-
way
,
and
he
stand
listen
,
with
the
mug
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
odd
enough
to
see
the
change
that
come
over
Newman
as
Smike
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
he
stand
,
rub
his
lip
with
the
back
of
his
hand
,
as
a
preparatory
ceremony
towards
compose
himself
for
a
draught
;
then
,
at
the
mention
of
Squeers
,
he
take
the
mug
under
his
arm
,
and
open
his
eye
very
wide
,
look
on
,
in
the
utmost
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
when
Smike
come
to
the
assault
upon
himself
in
the
hackney
coach
,
he
hastily
deposit
the
mug
upon
the
table
,
and
limp
up
and
down
the
room
in
a
state
of
the
great
excitement
,
stop
himself
with
a
jerk
,
every
now
and
then
,
as
if
to
listen
more
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
when
John
Browdie
come
to
be
speak
of
,
he
drop
,
by
slow
and
gradual
degree
,
into
a
chair
,
and
rubbing
,
his
hand
upon
his
knee
---
quick
and
quicker
as
the
story
reach
its
climax
---
burst
,
at
last
,
into
a
laugh
compose
of
one
loud
sonorous
"
<EOS>
ha
!
ha
!
"
have
give
vent
to
which
,
his
countenance
immediately
fall
again
as
he
inquire
,
with
the
utmost
anxiety
,
whether
it
be
probable
that
John
Browdie
and
Squeers
have
come
to
blow
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
I

not

Smike
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

me
till
I

quite
away

"
   
<EOS>
Newman
scratch
his
head
with
a
shout
of
great
disappointment
,
and
once
more
lift
up
the
mug
,
apply
himself
to
the
content
;
smile
meanwhile
,
over
the
rim
,
with
a
grim
and
ghastly
smile
at
Smike
.

"
You

He
be
go
on
,
in
his

when

chance
to

at

he
see
that
he
have
cover
his
face
with
his
hand

a

the

unwonted
fire

and

up
with
an
excitement

make

appear

for

moment

quite
a
different

<EOS>
"

well

mutter
Newman

as
if
he
be
a
little
puzzled

"
It

more

<EOS>
It
be
by
no
means
clear
,
from
the
tone
of
these
broken
reflection
,
that
Newman
Noggs
consider
them
as
explain
,
at
all
satisfactorily
,
the
emotion
which
have
suggest
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
,
in
a
musing
attitude
,
for
some
time
,
regard
Smike
occasionally
with
an
anxious
and
doubtful
glance
,
which
sufficiently
show
that
he
be
not
very
remotely
connected
with
his
thought
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
he
repeat
his
proposition
that
Smike
should
remain
where
he
be
for
that
night
,
and
that
he
(
Noggs
)
should
straightway
repair
to
the
cottage
to
relieve
the
suspense
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
Smike
would
not
hear
of
this
---
plead
his
anxiety
to
see
his
friend
again
---
they
eventually
sally
forth
together
;
and
the
night
being
,
by
this
time
,
far
advanced
,
and
Smike
be
,
besides
,
<EOS>
so
footsore
that
he
could
hardly
crawl
along
,
it
be
within
an
hour
of
sunrise
when
they
reach
their
destination
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
first
sound
of
their
voice
outside
the
house
,
Nicholas
,
who
have
pass
a
sleepless
night
,
devising
scheme
for
the
recovery
of
his
lost
charge
,
start
from
his
bed
,
and
joyfully
admit
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
noisy
conversation
,
and
congratulation
,
and
indignation
,
that
the
remainder
of
the
family
be
soon
awaken
,
and
Smike
receive
a
warm
and
cordial
welcome
,
not
only
from
Kate
,
but
from
Mrs
Nickleby
also
,
who
assure
him
of
her
future
favour
and
regard
,
and
be
so
obliging
as
to
relate
,
for
his
entertainment
and
that
of
the
assemble
circle
,
a
most
remarkable
account
extract
from
some
work
the
name
of
which
she
have
never
know

of
a
miraculous
escape
from
some
prison

what

effect
by
an
officer
whose
name
she
have
forget
,
confine
for
some
crime
which

<EOS>
at
first
Nicholas
be
dispose
to
give
his
uncle
credit
for
some
portion
of
this
bold
attempt
(
which
have
so
nearly
prove
successful
)
to
carry
off
Smike
;
but
on
more
mature
consideration
,
he
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
full
merit
of
it
rest
with
Mr
Squeers
.
<EOS>
determine
to
ascertain
,
if
he
could
,
through
John
Browdie
,
how
the
case
really
stand
,
he
betake
himself
to
his
daily
occupation
:
meditating
,
as
he
go
,
on
a
great
variety
of
scheme
for
the
punishment
of
the
Yorkshire
schoolmaster
,
all
of
which
have
their
foundation
in
the
strict
principle
of
retributive
justice
,
and
have
<EOS>

the
one
drawback

be
wholly
impracticable

all

<EOS>
when
it
be
fine
weather
,
and
he
can
crawl
out

,
he
draw
a
chair
close
to
the
window

sit
there
,
look
at
them
and
arrange
them
,
all
day
long

<EOS>
He
use
to
nod
,
at
first
,
and
then
we
come
to
speak

<EOS>
formerly
,
when
I
call
to
him
of
a
morning

ask
him
how
he
be

he
would
smile
,

say
,
"
well
!

but
now
he
shake
his
head
,
and
only
bend
more
closely
over
his
old
plant
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
dull
to
watch
the
dark
housetop
and
the
fly
cloud
,
for
so
many
month

he
be
very
patient
.

be
there
nobody
in

cheer

"
His
father
live
there

I

Tim

"
and
other
people
too
;
but
no
one
seem
to
care
much
for
the
poor
sickly
cripple

<EOS>
I
have
ask
him
,
very
often
,
if
I
can
do
nothing
for
him
;
his
answer
be
always
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
.

"
 
<EOS>
His
voice
be
grow
weak
of
late
,
but
I
can
see
that
he
make
the
old
reply
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
leave
his
bed
now
,
so
they
have
move
it
close
beside
the
window
,
and
there
he
lie
,
all
day
:
now
look
at
the
sky
,
and
now
at
his
flower
,
which
he
still
make
shift
to
trim
and
water
,
with
his
own
thin
hand
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
,
when
he
see
my
candle
,
he
draw
back
his
curtain
,
and
leave
it
so
,
till
I
be
in
bed

<EOS>
It
seem
such
company
to
him
to
know
that
I
be
there
,
that
I
often
sit
at
my
window
for
an
hour
or
more
,
that
he
may
see
I
be
still
awake
;
and
sometimes
I
get
up
in
the
night
to
look
at
the
dull
melancholy
light
in
his
little
room
,
and
wonder
whether
he
be
awake
or
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
night
will
not
be
long
come

will
sleep

wake
again
on

have
never
so
much
as
shaken
hand
in
all
our
life

yet
I
shall
miss
him
like
an
old
friend

be
there
any
country
flower
that
could
interest
me
like
these

do
you
think
?

do
you
suppose
that
the
withering
of
a
hundred
kind
of
the
choice
flower
that
blow
,
call
by
the
hard
latin
name
that
be
ever
invent
,
would
give
me
one
fraction
of
the
pain
that
I
shall
feel
when
these
old
jug

bottle
be
sweep
away
as
lumber

<EOS>
cry
Tim
,
with
a
contemptuous
emphasis

do
not

such
a

anywhere

<EOS>
with
which
inquiry
<EOS>
,
Tim
turn
his
back
,
and
pretend
to
be
absorb
in
his

take
an
opportunity

hastily
wipe
his
eye

another
way

<EOS>
whether
it
be
that
Tim

whether
it

a
little
disturb

it
so
happen
that
when
Nicholas

from

some
commission

inquire
whether
Mr

alone
in

Tim
promptly
,
and
without
the
small
hesitation
,
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
although
somebody
have
pass
into
the
room
not
ten

before

so
,
Nicholas
open
the
door
and
walk
in
;
and
very
quickly
he
turn
to
walk
out
again
,
when
he
see
,
to
his
great
astonishment
and
discomfiture
,
a
young
lady
upon
her
knee
at
Mr

foot

Mr

from

he
recognise
the

clumsy

between
his
admiration
of
the
young

beauty
,
and
the
confusion

surprise

this
unexpected
recognition

he
stand
stock

in
such

her

Nicholas
hazard
one

two
further
remark

it
be
evident
that
Tim

his

reason
for

that

be
determined
to

no

taciturnity

come
to

save
such
as
be
to
be
infer
from
several
grave
nod
and
shrug
,
which
only
serve
to
whet
that
appetite

intelligence

which

already

unreasonable

in

there

Nicholas
could
not
help
suspect
that
,
for
some
reason
or
other
,
he
be
send
out
of
the
way
on
purpose
,
and
that
the
young
lady
be
there
in
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
transpired
,
however
,
to
confirm
this
suspicion
,
and
Tim
could
not
be
entrap
into
any
confession
or
admission
tend
to
support
it
in
the
small
degree
.
   
<EOS>
mystery
and
disappointment
be
not
absolutely
indispensable
to
the
growth
of
love
,
but
they
be
,
very
often
,
its
powerful
auxiliary
.
<EOS>
"
out
of
sight
,
out
of
mind
,
"
be
well
enough
as
a
proverb
applicable
to
case
of
friendship
,
though
absence
be
not
always
necessary
to
hollowness
of
heart
,
even
between
friend
,
and
truth
and
honesty
,
like
precious
stone
,
be
perhaps
most
easily
imitate
at
a
distance
,
when
the
counterfeit
often
pass
for
real
.
 
<EOS>
Love
,
however
,
be
very
materially
assist
by
a
warm
and
active
imagination
:
which
have
a
long
memory
,
and
will
thrive
,
for
a
considerable
time
,
on
very
slight
and
spare
food
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
be
,
that
it
often
attain
its
most
luxuriant
growth
in
separation
and
under
circumstance
of
the
utmost
difficulty
;
and
thus
it
be
,
that
Nicholas
,
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
unknown
young
lady
,
from
day
to
day
and
from
hour
to
hour
,
begin
,
at
last
,
to
think
that
he
be
very
desperately
in
love
with
her
,
and
that
never
be
such
an
ill
-
use
and
persecute
lover
as
he
.
   
<EOS>
still
,
though
he
love
and
languish
after
the
most
orthodox
model
,
and
be
only
deter
from
make
a
confidante
of
Kate
by
the
slight
consideration
of
have
never
,
in
all
his
life
,
speak
to
the
object
of
his
passion
,
and
have
never
set
eye
upon
her
,
except
on
two
occasion
,
on
both
of
which
she
have
come
and
go
like
a
flash
of
lightning
---
or
,
as
Nicholas
himself
say
,
in
the
numerous
conversation
he
hold
with
himself
,
like
a
vision
of
youth
and
beauty
much
too
bright
to
last
---
his
ardour
and
devotion
remain
without
its
reward
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
lady
appear
no
more
;
so
there
be
a
great
deal
of
love
waste
(
enough
indeed
to
have
set
up
half
-
a
-
dozen
young
gentleman
,
as
time
go
,
with
the
utmost
decency
)
,
and
nobody
be
a
bit
the
wise
for
it
;
not
even
Nicholas
himself
,
who
,
on
the
contrary
,
become
more
dull
,
sentimental
,
and
lackadaisical
,
every
day
.
   
<EOS>
while
matter
be
in
this
state
,
the
failure
of
a
correspondent
of
the
brother
cheeryble
,
in
Germany
,
impose
upon
Tim
Linkinwater
and
Nicholas
<EOS>
the
necessity
of
go
through
some
very
long
and
complicated
account
,
extend
over
a
considerable
space
of
time
.
<EOS>
to
get
through
them
with
the
great
dispatch
,
Tim
Linkinwater
propose
that
they
should
remain
at
the
counting
-
house
,
for
a
week
or
so
,
until
ten
o'clock
at
night
;
to
this
,
as
nothing
damp
the
zeal
of
Nicholas
in
the
service
of
his
kind
patron
---
not
even
romance
,
which
have
seldom
business
habit
---
he
cheerfully
assent
.
<EOS>
on
the
very
first
night
of
these
later
hour
,
at
nine
exactly
,
there
come
:
not
the
young
lady
herself
,
but
her
servant
,
who
,
be
closet
with
brother
Charles
for
some
time
,
go
away
,
and
return
next
night
at
the
same
hour
,
and
on
the
next
,
and
on
the
next
again
.
   
<EOS>
these
repeat
visit
inflame
the
curiosity
of
Nicholas
to
the
very
high
pitch
.
 
<EOS>
tantalised
and
excited
,
beyond
all
bearing
,
and
unable
to
fathom
the
mystery
without
neglect
his
duty
,
he
confide
the
whole
secret
to
Newman
Noggs
,
implore
him
to
be
on
the
watch
next
night
;
to
follow
the
girl
home
;
to
set
on
foot
such
inquiry
relative
to
the
name
,
condition
,
and
history
of
her
mistress
,
as
he
could
,
without
exciting
suspicion
;
and
to
report
the
result
to
him
with
the
least
possible
delay
.
   
<EOS>
beyond
all
measure
proud
of
this
commission
,
Newman
Noggs
take
up
his
post
,
in
the
square
,
on
the
follow
evening
,
a
full
hour
before
the
needful
time
,
and
plant
himself
behind
the
pump
and
pull
his
hat
over
his
eye
,
begin
his
watch
with
an
elaborate
appearance
of
mystery
,
admirably
calculate
to
excite
the
suspicion
of
all
beholder
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
diver
servant
girl
who
come
to
draw
water
,
and
sundry
little
boy
who
stop
to
drink
at
the
ladle

almost
scare
out
of
their
sense
,
by
the
apparition
of
Newman
Noggs
look
<EOS>
stealthily
round
the
pump
,
with
nothing
of
him
visible
but
his
face
,
and
that
wear
the
expression
of
a
meditative
Ogre

<EOS>
punctual
to
her
time
,
the
messenger
come
again
,
and
,
after
an
interview
of
rather
long
duration

do
you

"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Noggs
literally
gasp
for
breath
as
this
flood
of
question
rush
upon
him
,
and
move
spasmodically
in
his
chair
at
every
fresh
inquiry
,
stare
at
Nicholas
meanwhile
with
a
most
ludicrous
expression
of
perplexity
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Newman
,
"
I
do
not
tell
her
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
tell
her
which
?
"
ask
Nicholas
.
   
<EOS>
"
about
the
glimpse
of
the
well
world
,
"
say
Newman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
tell
her
who
you
be
,
either
,
or
where
you
would
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
you
love
her
to
distraction
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
Newman
,
"
reply
Nicholas
,
with
his
characteristic
vehemence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
know
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
too
,
that
you
have
admire
her
for
a
long
time
in
secret
,
"
say
Newman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
she
say
to
that
?
"
ask
Nicholas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Blushed
,
"
say
Newman
.
   
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
she
would
,
"
say
Nicholas
approvingly
.
<EOS>
Newman
then
go
on
to
say
,
that
the
young
lady
be
an
only
child
,
that
her
mother
be
dead
,
that
she
reside
with
her
father
,
and
that
she
have
be
induce
to
allow
her
lover
a
secret
interview
,
at
the
intercession
of
her
servant
,
who
have
great
influence
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
further
relate
how
it
require
much
move
and
great
eloquence
to
bring
the
young
lady
to
this
pass
;
how
it
be
expressly
understand
that
she
merely
afford
Nicholas
an
opportunity
of
declare
his
passion
;
and
how
she
by
no
mean
pledge
herself
to
be
favourably
impressed
with
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
the
mystery
of
her
visit
to
the
brother
Cheeryble
remain
wholly
unexplained
,
for
Newman
have
not
allude
to
them
,
either
in
his
preliminary
conversation
with
the
servant
or
his
subsequent
interview
with
the
mistress
,
merely
remark
that
he
have
be
instruct
to
watch
the
girl
home
and
plead
his
young
friend
's
cause
,
and
not
say
how
far
he
have
follow
her
,
or
from
what
point
.
 
<EOS>
but
Newman
hint
that
from
what
have
fall
from
the
confidante
,
he
have
be
lead
to
suspect
that
the
young
lady
lead
a
very
miserable
and
unhappy
life
,
under
the
strict
control
of
her
only
parent
,
who
be
of
a
violent
and
brutal
temper
;
a
circumstance
which
he
think
may
in
some
degree
account
,
both
for
her
have
seek
the
protection
and
friendship
of
the
brother
,
and
her
suffer
herself
to
be
prevail
upon
to
grant
the
promised
interview
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
he
hold
to
be
a
very
logical
deduction
from
the
premise
,
inasmuch
as
it
be
but
natural
to
suppose
that
a
young
lady
,
whose
present
condition
be
so
unenviable
,
would
be
more
than
commonly
desirous
to
change
it
.
   
<EOS>
It
appear
,
on
further
questioning
---
<EOS>
for
it
be
only
by
a
very
long
and
arduous
process
that
all
this
could
be
get
out
of
Newman
Noggs
---
that
Newman
,
in
explanation
of
his
shabby
appearance
,
have
represent
himself
as
be
,
for
certain
wise
and
indispensable
purpose
connect
with
that
intrigue
,
in
disguise
;
and
,
be
question
how
he
have
come
to
exceed
his
commission
so
far
as
to
procure
an
interview
,
he
respond
,
that
the
lady
appear
willing
to
grant
it
,
he
consider
himself
bind
,
both
in
duty
and
gallantry
,
to
avail
himself
of
such
a
golden
mean
of
enable
Nicholas
to
prosecute
his
address
.
 
<EOS>
after
these
and
all
possible
question
have
be
ask
and
answer
twenty
time
over
,
they
part
,
undertake
to
meet
on
the
following
night
at
half
-
past
ten
,
for
the
purpose
of
fulfil
the
appointment
;
which
be
for
eleven
o'clock
.
   
<EOS>
"
thing
come
about
very
strangely
!
"
<EOS>
think
Nicholas
,
as
he
walk
home
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
contemplate
anything
of
this
kind
;
never
dreamt
of
the
possibility
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
to
know
something
of
the
life
of
one
in
whom
I
feel
such
interest
;
to
see
her
in
the
street
,
to
pass
the
house
in
which
she
live
,
to
meet
her
sometimes
in
her
walk
,
to
hope
that
a
day
may
come
when
I
may
be
in
a
condition
to
tell
her
of
my
love
,
this
be
the
utmost
extent
of
my
thought
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
however
---
but
I
should
be
a
fool
,
indeed
,
to
repine
at
my
own
good
fortune
!
"
   
<EOS>
still
,
Nicholas
be
dissatisfy
;
and
there
be
more
in
the
dissatisfaction
than
mere
revulsion
of
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
angry
with
the
young
lady
for
be
so
easily
win
,
"
because
,
"
reason
Nicholas
,
"
it
be
not
as
if
she
know
it
be
I
,
but
it
may
have
be
anybody
,
"
---
<EOS>
which
be
certainly
not
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
moment
,
he
be
angry
with
himself
for
entertain
such
thought
,
argue
that
nothing
but
goodness
could
dwell
in
such
a
temple
,
and
that
the
behaviour
of
the
brother
sufficiently
show
the
estimation
in
which
they
hold
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
she
be
a
mystery
altogether
,
"
say
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
more
satisfactory
than
his
previous
course
of
reflection
,
and
only
drive
him
out
upon
a
new
sea
of
speculation
and
conjecture
,
where
he
toss
and
tumble
,
in
great
discomfort
of
mind
,
until
the
clock
strike
ten
,
and
the
hour
of
meeting
draw
nigh
.
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
have
dress
himself
with
great
care
,
and
even
Newman
Noggs
have
trim
himself
up
a
little
;
<EOS>
his
coat
present
the
phenomenon
of
two
consecutive
button
,
and
the
supplementary
pin
be
insert
at
tolerably
regular
interval
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
his
hat
,
too
,
in
the
new
taste
,
with
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
in
the
crown
,
and
a
twisted
end
of
it
straggle
out
behind
after
the
fashion
of
a
pigtail
,
though
he
could
scarcely
lay
claim
to
the
ingenuity
of
invent
this
latter
decoration
,
inasmuch
as
he
be
utterly
unconscious
of
it
:
be
in
a
nervous
and
excited
condition
which
render
him
quite
insensible
to
everything
<EOS>
but
the
great
object
of
the
expedition
.
   
<EOS>
They
traverse
the
street
in
profound
silence
;
and
after
walk
at
a
round
pace
for
some
distance
,
arrive
in
one
,
of
a
gloomy
appearance
and
very
little
frequented
,
near
the
Edgeware
Road
.
   
<EOS>
"
number
twelve
,
"
say
Newman
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
reply
Nicholas
,
look
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
good
street
?
"
say
Newman
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
return
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
rather
dull
.
"
   
<EOS>
Newman
make
no
answer
to
this
remark
,
but
,
halt
abruptly
,
plant
Nicholas
with
his
back
to
some
area
railing
,
and
give
him
to
understand
that
he
be
to
wait
there
,
without
move
hand
or
foot
,
until
it
be
satisfactorily
ascertain
that
the
coast
be
clear
.
<EOS>
this
do
,
Noggs
limp
away
with
great
alacrity
;
look
over
his
shoulder
every
instant
,
to
make
quite
certain
that
Nicholas
be
obey
his
direction
;
and
,
ascend
the
step
of
a
house
some
half
-
dozen
door
off
,
be
lose
to
view
.
   
<EOS>
after
a
short
delay
,
he
reappear
,
and
limp
back
again
,
halted
midway
,
and
beckon
Nicholas
to
follow
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
?
"
say
Nicholas
,
advance
towards
him
on
tiptoe
.
   
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
"
reply
Newman
,
in
high
glee
.
 
<EOS>
"
all
ready
;
nobody
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Could
not
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
ha
!
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
with
this
fortify
assurance
,
he
steal
past
a
street
-
door
,
on
which
Nicholas
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
brass
plate
,
with
"
bobster
,
"
in
very
large
letter
;
and
,
stop
at
the
area
-
gate
,
which
be
open
,
sign
to
his
young
friend
to
descend
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
the
devil
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Nicholas
,
draw
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
we
to
sneak
into
the
kitchen
,
as
if
we
come
after
the
fork

"
   
<EOS>
"
hush

Newman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Old
Bobster

ferocious
Turk

<EOS>
cry
Nicholas
,
in
high
wrath
,

you

He
have
no
time
to
sing
the
praise
of
his
mistress
,
<EOS>
just
then
,
for
Newman
give
him
a
gentle
push
which
have
nearly
precipitate
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
area
step
.
 
<EOS>
think
it
good
to
take
the
hint
in
good
part
,
Nicholas
descend
,
without
further
remonstrance
,
but
with
a
countenance
bespeak
anything
rather
than
the
hope
and
rapture
of
a
passionate
lover
.
 
<EOS>
Newman
follow
---
he
would
have
follow
head
first
,
but
for
the
timely
assistance
of
Nicholas
---
and
,
take
his
hand
,
lead
him
through
a
stone
passage
,
profoundly
dark
,
into
a
back
-
kitchen
or
cellar
,
of
the
black
and
most
pitchy
obscurity
,
where
they
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
Nicholas
,
in
a
discontent
whisper
,
"
this
be
not
all
,
I
suppose
,
be
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
no

"
rejoin
Noggs
;
"
they
will
be
here
directly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
it

"
say
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
think
it
,
I
confess

"
   
<EOS>
They
exchange
no
further
word
,
and
there
Nicholas
stand
,
listen
to
the
loud
breathing
of
Newman
Noggs
,
and
imagine
that
his
nose
seem
to
glow
like
a
red
-
hot
coal
,
even
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
which
enshroud
them
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
the
sound
of
cautious
footstep
attract
his
ear
,
and
directly
afterwards
a
female
voice
inquire
if
the
gentleman
be
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
reply
Nicholas
,
turn
towards
the
corner
from
which
the
voice
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
only
me
,
sir
,
"
reply
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
if
you
please

madam

"
   
a
gleam
of
light
shine
into
the
place
,
and
presently
the
servant
girl
appear
,
bear
a
light
,
and
follow
by
her
young
mistress
,
who
seem
to
be
overwhelm
by
modesty
and
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
at
sight
of
the
young
lady
,
Nicholas
start
and
change
colour
;
his
heart
beat
violently
,
and
he
stand
root
to
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
instant
,
and
almost
simultaneously
with
her
arrival
and
that
of
the
candle
,
there
be
hear
a
loud
and
furious
knocking
at
the
street
-
door
,
which
cause
Newman
Noggs
to
jump
up
,
with
great
agility
,
from
a
beer
-
barrel
on
which
he
have
be
seat
astride
,
and
to
exclaim
abruptly
,
and
with
a
face
of
ashy
paleness
,

Lord

<EOS>
the
young
lady
shriek
,
the
attendant
wring
her
hand
,
Nicholas
gaze
from
one
to
the
other
in
apparent
stupefaction
,
and
Newman
hurry
to
and
fro
,
thrust
his
hand
into
all
his
pocket
successively
,
and
draw
out
the
lining
of
every
one
in
the
excess
of
his
irresolution
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
moment
,
but
the
confusion
crowd
into
that
one
moment
no
imagination
can
exaggerate
.

but
Nicholas
may
as
well
have
speak
to
the
wind
,
for
the
young
lady
,
with
distract
look
,
hurry
up
the
stair

<EOS>
He
would
have

Newman

twist
his

in
his

drag
him
towards

by
the

of
Newman

tear
and

and
the
tremendous
knocking

precisely
as

he

make
their

at

some
romantic
Passages
between
Mrs
Nickleby
and
the
Gentleman
in
the
Small

clothe
next
Door
 
ever
since
her
last
momentous
conversation
with
her
son
,
Mrs
Nickleby
have
begin
to
display
unusual
care
in
the
adornment
of
her
person
,
gradually
superadde
to
those
staid
and
matronly
habiliment
,
which
have
,
up
to
that
time
,
form
her
ordinary
attire
,
a
variety
of
embellishment
and
decoration
,
slight
perhaps
in
themselves
,
but
,
take
together
,
and
consider
with
reference
to
the
subject
of
her
disclosure
,
of
no
mean
importance
.
 
<EOS>
even
her
black
dress
assume
something
of
a
deadly
-
lively
air
from
the
jaunty
style
in
which
it

;
and
,
eke
out
as
its
linger
attraction

;
by
a
prudent
disposal

here

there

of
certain
juvenile
ornament
of
little

no

for
that
reason
alone

escape
the
general
wreck
and
be
permit
to
slumber
peacefully
in
odd
corner
of
old
drawer
and
box
where
daylight
seldom
shine

her
mourning
garment

quite
a
new
character

from

the
outward

sorrow

they

convert
into
signal
of
very
slaughterous
and
kill
design
upon
the
living

<EOS>
Mrs
Nickleby
may
have
be
stimulate
to
this
proceeding
by
a
lofty
sense
of
duty
,
and
impulse
of
unquestionable
excellence
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
,
by
this
time
,
have
become
impressed
with
the
sinfulness
of
long
indulgence
in
unavaile
woe
,
or
the
necessity
of
set
a
proper
example
of
neatness
and
decorum
to
her
bloom
daughter

<EOS>
consideration
of
duty
and
responsibility

the
change

its
rise

feeling
of

pure
and
most
disintereste
charity

<EOS>
the
gentleman
next
door
have
be
vilify
by
Nicholas

rudely
stigmatise
as
a
dotard

an
idiot

for
these
attack
upon
his
understanding
,
Mrs
Nickleby
be
,
in
some
sort
,
accountable

<EOS>
She
may
have
feel
that
it
be
the
act
of
a
good
Christian
to
show
by
all
mean
in
her
power
,
that
the
abuse
gentleman
be
neither
the
one
nor
the
other

<EOS>
and
what
well
mean
could
she
adopt
,
towards
so
virtuous
and
laudable
an
end
,
than
prove
to
all
man
,
in
her
own
person
,
that
his
passion
be
the
most
rational
and
reasonable
in
the
world

and
just
the
very
result

of
all
other

which
discreet

thinking
person

from

incautiously
display
her
mature
charm

without

under

very
eye

of
an
ardent

susceptible
man

<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"

Mrs

gravely
shake
her

Nicholas

whether

<EOS>
"
roast
pig
;
let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
day
five
week
after
you
be
christen
,
we
have
a
roast
---
<EOS>
no
,
that
could
not
have
be
a
pig
,
either
,
because
I
recollect
there
be
a
pair
of
them
to
carve
,
and
your
poor
papa
<EOS>
and
I
could
never
have
think
of
sit
down
to
two
pig
<EOS>
---
they
must
have
be
partridge
.
 
<EOS>
roast
pig
!
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
think
we
ever
could
have
have
one
,
now
I
come
to
remember
,
for
your
papa
could
never
bear
the
sight
of
them
in
the
shop
,
and
use
to
say
that
they
always
put
him
in
mind
of
very
little
baby
,
only
the
pig
have
much
fairer
complexion
;
and
he
have
a
horror
of
little
baby
,
to
,
because
he
could
not
very
well
afford
any
increase
to
his
family
,
and
have
a
natural
dislike
to
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
odd
now
<EOS>
,
what
can
have
put
that
in
my
head
!
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
dine
once
at
Mrs
Bevan
's
,
in
that
broad
street
round
the
corner
by
the
coachmaker
's
,
where
the
tipsy
man
fall
through
the
cellar
-
flap
of
an
empty
house
nearly
a
week
before
the
quarter
-
day
,
and
be
not
find
till
the
new
tenant
go
in
---
and
<EOS>
we
have
roast
pig
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
that
,
I
think
,
that
remind
me
of
it
,
especially
as
there
be
a
little
bird
in
the
room
that
would
keep
on
singe
all
the
time
of
dinner
---
at
least
,
not
a
little
bird
,
for
it
be
a
parrot
,
and
he
do
not
sing
exactly
,
for
he
talk
and
swear
dreadfully
:
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
must
be
that
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
sure
it
must
.
 
<EOS>
Should
not
you
say
so
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
there
be
not
a
doubt
about
it
,
mama
,
"
return
Kate
,
with
a
cheerful
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
;
but
<EOS>
do
you
think
so
,
Kate
?
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
,
with
as
much
gravity
as
if
it
be
a
question
of
the
most
imminent
and
thrilling
interest
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
not
,
say
so
at
once
,
you
know
;
because
it
be
just
as
well
to
be
correct
,
particularly
on
a
point
of
this
kind
,
which
be
very
curious
and
worth
settle
while
one
think
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Kate
laughingly
reply
that
she
be
quite
convinced
;
and
as
her
mama
still
appear
undetermined
whether
it
be
not
absolutely
essential
that
the
subject
should
be
renew
,
propose
that
they
should
take
their
work
into
the
summer
-
house
,
and
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Nickleby
readily
assent
,
and
to
the
summer
-
house
they
repair
,
without
further
discussion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
say
,
"
observe
Mrs
Nickleby
,
as
she
take
her
seat
,
"
that
there
never
be
such
a
good
creature
as
Smike
.
 
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
the
pain
he
have
take
in
put
this
little
arbour
to
right
,
and
train
the
sweetest
flower
about
it
,
be
beyond
anything
I
could
have
---
I
wish
he
would
not
put
all
the
gravel
on
your
side
,
Kate
,
my
dear
,
though
,
and
leave
nothing
but
mould
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
dear
mama

"
return
Kate
,
hastily
,
"
take
this
seat

to
oblige
me
,
mama

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
no

indeed

my

<EOS>
I
shall
keep
my

Mrs
Nickleby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

I
declare

<EOS>
Kate
look
up
inquiringly

<EOS>
"
if

Mrs

,
"
and
get
,
from
somewhere

other

root
of

I
say
I
be
so
fond
of

the
other
night

ask

no

I
take

very
kind

attentive

add
Mrs
Nickleby
,
look
narrowly
about
her
,
"
any
of
them
on
my
side

I
suppose
they
grow
best
near
the
gravel

<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
it
they
do
,
Kate
,
and
that
be
the
reason
they
be
all
near
you

put
the
gravel
there

sunny
side

there
for
half
an
hour
before
go

for
I
have
just
come
off
a
journey

prefer
stop
here
tonight
,
to
go
home
at
this
hour
,
where
I
be
not

choose

express
himself

very
disrespectful
,
and
insolently
familiar
term

of
a
young
lady

I
recognise
from
his
description
and
other
circumstance

and
whom
I
have
the
honour
to
know

<EOS>
as
he
speak
loud
enough
to
be
overhear
by
the
other

I
inform
him
most
civilly
that
he
be
mistaken
in
his

be
of

offensive
nature

him
to
forbear

He
do
so
for

but
as
he
choose
to
renew
his
conversation
when
leave

in
a
more
offensive
strain
than
before

I
could
not
refrain
from
make
after
him
,

facilitate
his
departure
by
a
kick

reduce
him

the

<EOS>
of

there
be
certainly
not
one
which
,
in
his

could
have
appear
more
laudable
to
Nicholas

this

<EOS>
there
be
not
many
subject
of
dispute
which
at
that
moment
could
have
come
home
to
his

breast
more
powerfully

have
the
unknown
uppermost
in

it
naturally
occur

him
that
he

have
do
just

gossiper
durst

presume
in

lightly

by

he
espouse
the
young

quarrel
with
great
warmth

protest
that
he
have
do
quite
right
,

that
he
respect
him
for
it
;
which
John
Browdie
(
albeit
not
quite
clear
as

the
merit

immediately
protest

vehemence

to
reflect

<EOS>
"
where
can
I
have

stop
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
yes
,
to
be
sure
---
he
belong
to
a
register
-
office
up
at
the
west
end
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
recollect
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
Tom
,
the
ugly
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
odd
enough
!
"
<EOS>
say
Nicholas
,
ruminate
upon
the
strange
manner
in
which
the
register
-
office
seem
to
start
up
and
stare
him
in
the
face
every
now
and
then
,
and
when
he
least
expect
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
much
oblige
to
you
for
your
kind
advocacy
of
my
cause
when
it
most
need
an
advocate
,
"
say
the
young
man
,
laughing
,
and
draw
a
card
from
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
let
me
know
where
I
can
thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
take
the
card
,
and
glance
at
it
involuntarily
as
he
return
the
compliment
,
evince
very
great
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Frank
Cheeryble
!
"
say
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
surely
not
the
nephew
of
Cheeryble
Brothers
,
who
be
expect
tomorrow
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
usually
call
myself
the
nephew
of
the
firm
,
"
return
Mr
Frank
,
good
-
humouredly
;
"
but
of
the
two
excellent
individual
who
compose
it
,
I
be
proud
to
say
I
am
the
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
,
I
see
,
be
Mr
Nickleby
,
of
whom
I
have
hear
so
much
!
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
most
unexpected
meeting
,
but
not
the
less
welcome
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
respond
to
these
compliment
with
other
of
the
same
kind
,
and
they
shake
hand
warmly
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
introduce
John
Browdie
,
who
have
remain
in
a
state
of
great
admiration
ever
since
the
young
lady
in
the
bar
have
be
so
skilfully
win
over
to
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
then
Mrs
John
Browdie
be
introduce
,
and
finally
they
all
go
upstairs
together
and
spend
the
next
half
-
hour
with
great
satisfaction
and
mutual
entertainment
;
<EOS>
Mrs
John
Browdie
begin
the
conversation
by
declare
that
of
all
the
make
-
up
thing
she
ever
see
,
that
young
woman
below
-
stair
be
the
vain
and
the
plain
.
   
<EOS>
this
Mr
Frank
Cheeryble
,
although
,
to
judge
from
what
have
recently
take
place
,
a
hot
-
head
young
man
(
which
be
not
an
absolute
miracle
and
phenomenon
in
nature
)
,
be
a
sprightly
,
good
-
humoured
,
pleasant
fellow
,
with
much
both
in
his
countenance
and
disposition
that
remind
Nicholas
very
strongly
of
the
kind
-
hearted
brother
.
<EOS>
His
manner
be
as
unaffected
as
theirs
,
and
his
demeanour
full
of
that
heartiness
which
,
to
most
people
who
have
anything
generous
in
their
composition
,
be
peculiarly
prepossess
.
 
<EOS>
add
to
this
,
that
he
be
good
-
looking
and
intelligent
,
have
a
plentiful
share
of
vivacity
,
be
extremely
cheerful
,
and
accommodate
himself
in
five
minute
'
time
to
all
John
Browdie
's
oddity
with
as
much
ease
as
if
he
have
know
him
from
a
boy
;
and
it
will
be
a
source
of
no
great
wonder
that
,
when
they
part
for
the
night
,
he
have
produce
a
most
favourable
impression
,
not
only
upon
the
worthy
Yorkshireman
and
his
wife
,
but
upon
Nicholas
also
,
who
,
revolve
all
these
thing
in
his
mind
as
he
make
the
good
of
his
way
home
,
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
he
have
lay
the
foundation
of
a
most
agreeable
and
desirable
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
a
most
extraordinary
thing
about
that
register
-
office
fellow
!
"
think
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
likely
that
this
nephew
can
know
anything
about
that
beautiful
girl
?
 
<EOS>
when
Tim
Linkinwater
give
me
to
understand
the
other
day
that
he
be
come
to
take
a
share
in
the
business
here
,
he
say
he
have
be
superintend
it
in
Germany
for
four
year
,
and
that
during
the
last
six
month
he
have
be
engage
in
establish
an
agency
in
the
north
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
four
year
and
a
half
---
four
year
and
a
half
.
 
<EOS>
She
can
not
be
more
than
seventeen
---
say
eighteen
at
the
outside
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
quite
a
child
when
he
go
away
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
say
he
know
nothing
about
her
and
have
never
see
her
,
so
he
can
give
me
no
information
.
 
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
"
think
Nicholas
,
come
to
the
real
point
in
his
mind
,
"
there
can
be
no
danger
of
any
prior
occupation
of
her
affection
in
that
quarter
;
that
be
quite
clear
.
"
   
<EOS>
be
selfishness
a
necessary
ingredient
in
the
composition
of
that
passion
call
love
,
or
do
it
deserve
all
the
fine
thing
which
poet
,
in
the
exercise
of
their
undoubted
vocation
,
<EOS>
have
say
of
it
?
<EOS>
there
be
,
no
doubt
,
authenticate
instance
of
gentleman
have
give
up
lady
and
lady
have
give
up
gentleman
to
meritorious
rival
,
under
circumstance
of
great
high
-
mindedness
;
but
be
it
quite
establish
that
the
majority
of
such
lady
and
gentleman
have
not
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
,
and
nobly
resign
what
be
beyond
their
reach
;
as
a
private
soldier
may
register
a
vow
never
to
accept
the
order
of
the
Garter
,
or
a
poor
curate
of
great
piety
and
learning
,
but
of
no
family
---
save
a
very
large
family
of
child
---
may
renounce
a
bishopric
?
   
<EOS>
here
be
Nicholas
Nickleby
,
who
would
have
scorn
the
thought
of
count
how
the
chance
stand
of
his
rise
in
favour
or
fortune
with
the
brother
cheeryble
,
now
that
their
nephew
have
return
,
already
deep
in
calculation
whether
that
same
nephew
be
likely
to
rival
him
in
the
affection
of
the
fair
unknown
---
discuss
the
matter
with
himself
too
,
as
gravely
as
if
,
with
that
one
exception
,
it
be
all
settle
;
and
recur
to
the
subject
again
and
again
,
and
feel
quite
indignant
and
ill
-
use
at
the
notion
of
anybody
else
make
love
to
one
with
whom
he
have
never
exchange
a
word
in
all
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
he
exaggerate
rather
than
depreciate
the
merit
of
his
new
acquaintance
;
but
still
he
take
it
as
a
kind
of
personal
offence
that
he
should
have
any
merit
at
all
---
in
the
eye
of
this
particular
young
lady
,
that
is
;
for
elsewhere
he
be
quite
welcome
to
have
as
many
as
he
please
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
undoubted
selfishness
in
all
this
,
and
yet
Nicholas
be
of
a
most
free
and
generous
nature
,
with
as
few
mean
or
sordid
thought
,
perhaps
<EOS>
,
as
ever
fall
to
the
lot
of
any
man
;
and
there
be
no
reason
to
suppose
that
,
be
in
love
,
he
feel
and
think
differently
from
other
people
in
the
like
sublime
condition
.
   
<EOS>
He
do
not
stop
to
set
on
foot
an
inquiry
into
his
train
of
thought
or
state
of
feeling
,
however
;
but
go
think
on
all
the
way
home
,
and
continue
to
dream
on
in
the
same
strain
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
have
satisfy
himself
that
Frank
Cheeryble
could
have
no
knowledge
of
,
or
acquaintance
with
,
the
mysterious
young
lady
,
it
begin
to
occur
to
him
that
even
he
himself
may
never
see
her
again
;
upon
which
hypothesis
he
build
up
a
very
ingenious
succession
of
torment
idea
which
answer
his
purpose
even
better
than
the
vision
of
Mr
Frank
Cheeryble
,
and
tantalise
and
worry
him
,
wake
and
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
that
have
be
say
and
sing
to
the
contrary
,
there
be
no
well
-
establish
case
of
morning
have
either
defer
or
hasten
its
approach
by
the
term
of
an
hour
or
so
for
the
mere
gratification
of
a
splenetic
feeling
against
some
unoffending
lover
:
<EOS>
the
sun
have
,
in
the
discharge
of
his
public
duty
,
as
the
book
of
precedent
report
,
invariably
rise
accord
to
the
almanacs
,
and
without
suffer
himself
to
be
sway
by
any
private
consideration
.
<EOS>
so
,
morning
come
as
usual
,
and
with
it
business
-
hour
,
and
with
them
Mr
Frank
Cheeryble
,
and
with
him
a
long
train
of
smile
and
welcome
from
the
worthy
brother
,
and
a
more
grave
and
clerk
-
like
,
but
scarcely
less
hearty
reception
from
Mr
Timothy
Linkinwater
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
Mr
Frank
and
Mr
Nickleby
should
have
meet
last
night
,
"
say
Tim
Linkinwater
,
get
slowly
off
his
stool
,
and
look
round
the
counting
-
house
with
his
back
plant
against
the
desk
,
as
be
his
custom
when
he
have
anything
very
particular
to
say
:
"
that
those
two
young
man
should
have
meet
last
night
in
that
manner
be
,
I
say
,
a
coincidence
,
a
remarkable
coincidence
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
do
not
believe
now
,
"
add
Tim
,
take
off
his
spectacle
,
and
smile
as
with
gentle
pride
,
"
that
there
be
such
a
place
in
all
the
world
for
coincidence
as
London
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
about
that
,
"
say
Mr
Frank
;
"
<EOS>
but
---
"
   
"
do
not
know
about
it
,
Mr
Francis
!
"
<EOS>
interrupt
Tim
,
with
an
obstinate
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
let
us
know
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
well
place
for
such
thing

where
be
it
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
in
Europe

<EOS>
no

that
it

not

be
it
in

why

of
course
it

it
in
Africa
?
<EOS>
not
a

it

<EOS>
you
know
better
than

<EOS>
well
,
then
,
"
say
Tim
,
fold
his
arm
resolutely
,
"
where
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
about
to
dispute
the
point
,
Tim
,
"
say
young
Cheeryble
,
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
such
a
heretic
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
be
go
to
say
be
,
that
I
hold
myself
under
an
obligation
to
the
coincidence
,
that
be
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
dispute
it
,
"
say
Tim
,
quite
satisfied
,
"
that
be
another
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
<EOS>
what
though
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
or
anybody
would

<EOS>
I
would
so
put
that
man
down
,
"
say
Tim
,
tap
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
emphatically
with
his
spectacle
,
"
so
put
that
man
down
by
argument
---
"
   
It
be
quite
impossible
to
find
language
to
express
the
degree
of
mental
prostration
to
which
such
an
adventurous
wight
would
be
reduce
in
the
keen
encounter
with
Tim
Linkinwater
,
so
Tim
give
up
the
rest
of
his
declaration
in
pure
lack
of
word
,
and
mount
his
stool
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
may
consider
ourselves
,
brother
Ned
,
"
say
Charles
,
after
he
have
pat
Tim
Linkinwater
approvingly
on
the
back
,
"
very
fortunate
in
have
two
such
young
man
about
us
as
our
nephew
Frank

return
the
other

"
of
Tim

"
add
brother
Ned

"
I
say
nothing
whatever

an
infant

a
nobody

of

take
into
account
at
all

Tim
,
you
villain

what
do
you
say
to
that
,
sir

<EOS>
"
I
be
jealous
of
both
of

mean
to
look
out
for
another
situation
;
so
provide
yourself

gentleman
,
if
you
please

"
   
<EOS>
Tim
think
this
such
an
exquisite
,
unparalleled
,
and
most
extraordinary
joke
,
that
he
lay
his
pen
upon
the
inkstand
,
and
rather
tumble
off
his
stool
than
get
down
with
his
usual
deliberation
,
laugh
till
he
be
quite
faint
,
shake
his
head
all
the
time
so
that
little
particle
of
powder
fly
palpably
about
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
the
brother
at
all
behind
-
hand
,
for
they
laugh
almost
as
heartily
at
the
ludicrous
idea
of
any
voluntary
separation
between
themselves
and
old
Tim
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
and
Mr
Frank
laugh
quite
boisterously
,
perhaps
to
conceal
some
other
emotion
awaken
by
this
little
incident
,
(
and
so
,
indeed
,
do
the
three
old
fellow
after
the
first
burst
,
)
<EOS>
so
perhaps
there
be
as
much
keen
enjoyment
and
relish
in
that
laugh
,
altogether
,
as
the
politest
assembly
ever
derive
from
the
most
poignant
witticism
utter
at
any
one
person

expense

<EOS>
Mr

Charles

call
him
aside

take
him
kindly
by
the
hand

"
I

I

be
anxious

Poor
Mrs

accustomed

give

whatever
come
uppermost
in
her
mind

have
never
conceive
the
possibility
of
her
daughter

dwelling
upon
these

secret

the
more
especially
as
no
hard
trial
or
querulous
reproach
have
ever
draw
them
from

when

all

and
of
their
new

peaceful
life
,
bring
these
recollection
so
strongly
upon
Kate
that
she
could
not
suppress
them
,
Mrs
Nickleby
begin
to
have
a
glimmering
that
she
have
be
rather
thoughtless
now
and
then
,
and
be
conscious
of
something
like
self

reproach
as
she
embrace
her
daughter

and
yield
to
the
emotion
which
such
a
conversation
naturally
awaken

<EOS>
there

mighty

night

hard

cut
up
into
a
number

very
small
one

with
which
Mrs

would
have
garnish
the
little
sitting

in

could
not

attract
anybody

attention

if
Kate
have

spare
her
the
trouble

in
the

neatest
manner

the

Mr

apology

(

cordial

and
the
young

imitate

in
this
respect
so
well

formality
of

<EOS>
at
the

from
the
very
warmth

the
denial

there
must
be
something
in
it

<EOS>
Young
Mr

then
earnestly
entreat
old
Mr

to
confess
that
it

Mr

at

much
in

a
memorable
circumstance

one
worthy
of
remark

young
man
not
be
as
a
class
remarkable
for
modesty

self

denial

especially
when
there
be
a
lady
in
the
case

when
,
if
they
colour

it

rather
their

colour
the

after

Mr

and
Mrs

follow
at
a
short
distance

the
kindness
of
the
good
merchant
,
his
interest

his
admiration
of

so

very
narrow

with
the
old

pride
be
one
of
the
seven
deadly

faith

there

quiet
mirth
about

little
supper

there
be
one
circumstance
in
the
leave

taking
which

smiling

pleasantry

that
be

that
Mr
Frank
Cheeryble
offer
his
hand
to
Kate
twice
over

quite

he
have
bid
her
adieu
already

<EOS>
this

be
a
convincing
proof

the
jest

immense
laughter

in

tranquil
happiness

some
bright
day

many

let

hope

among
a

who
be
that
who
,
in
the
silence
of
his

chamber
,
sink
upon
his
knee
to
pray
as
his
first
friend
have
teach
him
,
and
fold
his
hand
and
stretch
them
wildly
in
the
air
,
fall
upon
his
face
in
a
passion
of
bitter
grief

cherish
every
bad
design
as
it
have
birth
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
scriptural
admonition
that
Ralph
Nickleby
heed
,
in
the
letter
,
be
"
know
thyself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
know
himself
well
,
and
choose
to
imagine
that
all
mankind
be
cast
in
the
same
mould
,
hate
them
;
for
,
though
no
man
hate
himself
,
the
cold
among
us
have
too
much
self
-
love
for
that
,
yet
most
man
unconsciously
judge
the
world
from
themselves
,
and
it
will
be
very
generally
find
that
those
who
sneer
habitually
at
human
nature
,
and
affect
to
despise
it
,
be
among
its
bad
and
least
pleasant
sample
.
   
<EOS>
but
the
present
business
of
these
adventure
be
with
Ralph
himself
,
who
stand
regard
Newman
Noggs
with
a
heavy
frown
,
while
that
worthy
take
off
his
fingerless
glove
,
and
spread
them
carefully
on
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
,
and
flatten
them
with
his
right
to
take
the
crease
out
,
proceed
to
roll
them
up
with
an
absent
air
as
if
he
be
utterly
regardless
of
all
thing
else
,
in
the
deep
interest
of
the
ceremonial
.
   
<EOS>
"
go
out
of
town

<EOS>
say
Ralph
,
slowly
.

"

yours

Ralph

with

.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

Newman
,

<EOS>
but
he
be
go

"
   
<EOS>
the
repetition
of
the
word
"
go
"
seem
to
afford
Newman
Noggs
inexpressible
delight
,
in
proportion
as
it
annoy
Ralph
Nickleby
.
<EOS>
He
utter
the
word
with
a
full
round
emphasis
,
dwell
upon
it
as
long
as
he
decently
could
,
and
when
he
could
hold
out
no
longer
without
attract
observation
,
stand
gasp
it
to
himself
as
if
even
that
be
a
satisfaction
.

where
have
he

away
;

pocket
his

Ralph

"
why

<EOS>
utter
these
word
with
supreme
contempt
and
great
irritation
of
manner
,
Ralph
sign
hastily
to
Newman
to
leave
the
room
;
and
throw
himself
into
his
chair
,
beat
his
foot
impatiently
upon
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
some

what

such
Devil

<EOS>
He
thrust
his
hand
impatiently
into
his
pocket
,
but
notwithstanding
his
previous
reflection
there
be
some
consolation
there
,
for
his
face
relax
a
little
;
and
although
there
be
still
a
deep
frown
upon
the
contract
brow
,
it
be
one
of
calculation
,

not
of
disappointment

<EOS>
"
this
Hawk
will
come
back

Ralph
;
"

<EOS>
Newman
return
no
answer
to
this
compliment
,
but
look
over
Ralph
's
shoulder
for
an
instant
,
(
he
be
adjust
the
collar
of
the
spencer
behind
,
just
then
,
)
as
if
he
be
strongly
disposed
to
tweak
him
by
the
nose
.
 
<EOS>
Meeting
Ralph
's
eye
,
however
,
he
suddenly
recall
his
wander
finger
,
and
rub
his
own
red
nose
with
a
vehemence
quite
astonishing
.
   
<EOS>
bestow
no
further
notice
upon
his
eccentric
follower
than
a
threatening
look
,
and
an
admonition
to
be
careful
and
make
no
mistake
<EOS>
,
Ralph
take
his
hat
and
glove
,
and
walk
out
.
   
<EOS>
He
appear
to
have
a
very
extraordinary
and
miscellaneous
connection
,
and
very
odd
call
he
make
,
some
at
great
rich
house
,
and
some
at
small
poor
one
,
but
all
upon
one
subject
:
money
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
be
a
talisman
to
the
porter
and
servant
of
his
more
dashing
client
,
and
procure
him
ready
admission
,
though
he
trudge
on
foot
,
and
other
,
who
be
deny
,
rattle
to
the
door
in
carriage
.
<EOS>
here
he
be
all
softness
and
cringe
civility
;
his
step
so
light
,
that
it
scarcely
produce
a
sound
upon
the
thick
carpet
;
his
voice
so
soft
that
it
be
not
audible
beyond
the
person
to
whom
it
be
address
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
the
poor
habitation
Ralph
be
another
man
;
his
boot
creak
upon
the
passage
floor
as
he
walk
boldly
in
;
his
voice
be
harsh
and
loud
as
he
demand
the
money
that
be
overdue
;
his
threat
be
coarse
and
angry
.
 
<EOS>
with
another
class
of
customer
,
Ralph
be
again
another
man
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
attorney
of
more
than
doubtful
reputation
,
who
help
him
to
new
business
,
or
raise
fresh
profit
upon
old
.
 
<EOS>
with
them
Ralph
be
familiar
and
jocose
,
humorous
upon
the
topic
of
the
day
,
and
especially
pleasant
upon
bankruptcy
and
pecuniary
difficulty
that
make
good
for
trade
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
would
have
be
difficult
to
have
recognise
the
same
man
under
these
various
aspect
,
but
for
the
bulky
leather
case
full
of
bill
and
note
which
he
draw
from
his
pocket
at
every
house
,
and
the
constant
repetition
of
the
same
complaint
,
(
vary
only
in
tone
and
style
of
delivery
,
)
that
the
world
think
him
rich
,
and
that
perhaps
he
may
be
if
he
have
his
own
;
but
there
be
no
get
money
in
when
it
be
once
out
,
either
principal
or
interest
,
and
it
be
a
hard
matter
to
live
;
even
to
live
from
day
to
day
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
evening
before
a
long
round
of
such
visit
(
interrupt
only
by
a
scanty
dinner
at
an
eat
-
house
)
terminate
at
Pimlico
,
and
Ralph
walk
along
St
James
's
Park
,
on
his
way
home
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
some
deep
scheme
in
his
head
,
as
the
pucker
brow
and
firmly
-
set
mouth
would
have
abundantly
testify
,
even
if
they
have
be
unaccompanied
by
a
complete
indifference
to
,
or
unconsciousness
of
,
the
object
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
complete
be
his
abstraction
,
however
,
that
Ralph
,
usually
as
quick
-
sight
as
any
man
,
do
not
observe
that
he
be
follow
by
a
shambling
figure
,
which
at
one
time
steal
behind
him
with
noiseless
footstep
,
at
another
crept
a
few
pace
before
him
,
and
at
another
glide
along
by
his
side
;
at
all
time
regard
him
with
an
eye
so
keen
,
and
a
look
so
eager
and
attentive
,
that
it
be
more
like
the
expression
of
an
intrusive
face
in
some
powerful
picture
or
strongly
mark
dream
,
than
the
scrutiny
even
of
a
most
interested
and
anxious
observer
.
   
<EOS>
the
sky
have
be
lower
and
dark
for
some
time
,
and
the
commencement
of
a
violent
storm
of
rain
drive
Ralph
for
shelter
to
a
tree
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
lean
against
it
with
fold
arm
,
still
bury
in
thought
,
when
,
happen
to
raise
his
eye
,
he
suddenly
meet
those
of
a
man
who
,
creep
round
the
trunk
,
peer
into
his
face
with
a
searching
look
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
usurer
's
expression
at
the
moment
,
which
the
man
appear
to
remember
well
,
for
it
decide
him
;
and
step
close
up
to
Ralph
,
he
pronounce
his
name
.
   
<EOS>
astonish
for
the
moment
,
Ralph
fall
back
a
couple
of
pace
and
survey
him
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
a
spare
,
dark
,
withered
man
,
of
about
his
own
age
,
with
a
stoop
body
,
and
a
very
sinister
face
render
more
ill
-
favour
by
hollow
and
hungry
cheek
,
deeply
sunburnt
,
and
thick
black
eyebrow
,
blacker
in
contrast
with
the
perfect
whiteness
of
his
hair
;
roughly
clothe
in
shabby
garment
,
of
a
strange
and
uncouth
make
;
and
have
about
him
an
indefinable
manner
of
depression
and
degradation
---
<EOS>
this
,
for
a
moment
,
be
all
he
see
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
look
again
,
and
the
face
and
person
seem
gradually
to
grow
less
strange
;
to
change
as
he
look
,
to
subside
and
soften
into
lineament
that
be
familiar
,
until
at
last
they
resolve
themselves
,
as
if
by
some
strange
optical
illusion
,
into
those
of
one
whom
he
have
know
for
many
year
,
and
forget
and
lose
sight
of
for
nearly
as
many
more
.
   
<EOS>
the
man
see
that
the
recognition
be
mutual
,
and
beckon
to
Ralph
to
take
his
former
place
under
the
tree
,
and
not
to
stand
in
the
fall
rain
,
of
which
,
in
his
first
surprise
,
he
have
be
quite
regardless
,
address
him
in
a
hoarse
,
faint
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
hardly
have
know
me
from
my
voice

suppose

Mr
Nickleby

no

Ralph

bend
a
severe
look
upon

remember
now

there

observe
the

Ralph

you
feel
no

need
express
none

<EOS>
"
Mr

say
the
man
,
bluntly
,
after
a
brief
pause
,
during
which
he
have
seem
to
struggle
with
an
inclination
to
answer
him
by
some
reproach
,

will
you
hear
a

word

advice

I

He

Ralph
quickly
reach
the
private
sitting
-
room
,
when
he
be
rather
amazed
by
the
confused
and
inexplicable
scene
in
which
he
suddenly
find
himself
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
all
the
young
-
lady
worker
,
some
with
bonnet
and
some
without
,
in
various
attitude
expressive
of
alarm
and
consternation
;
some
gather
round
Madame
Mantalini
,
who
be
in
tear
upon
one
chair
;
and
other
round
Miss
Knag
,
who
be
in
opposition
tear
upon
another
;
and
other
round
Mr
Mantalini
,
who
be
perhaps
the
most
striking
figure
in
the
whole
group
,
for
Mr
Mantalini
's
leg
be
extend
at
full
length
upon
the
floor
,
and
his
head
and
shoulder
be
support
by
a
very
tall
footman
,
who
do
not
seem
to
know
what
to
do
with
them
,
and
Mr
Mantalini
's
eye
be
closed
,
and
his
face
be
pale
and
his
hair
be
comparatively
straight
,
and
his
whisker
and
moustache
be
limp
,
and
his
tooth
be
clench
,
and
he
have
a
little
bottle
in
his
right
hand
,
and
a
little
tea
-
spoon
in
his
left
;
and
his
hand
,
arm
,
leg
,
and
shoulder
,
be
all
stiff
and
powerless
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
Madame
Mantalini
be
not
weep
upon
the
body
,
but
be
scold
violently
upon
her
chair
;
and
all
this
amidst
a
clamour
of
tongue
perfectly
deafen
,
and
which
really
appear
to
have
drive
the
unfortunate
footman
to
the
utmost
verge
of
distraction
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
here
?
"
say
Ralph
,
press
forward
.
   
<EOS>
at
this
inquiry
,
the
clamour
be
increase
twenty
-
fold
,
and
an
astounding
string
of
such
shrill
contradiction
as
"
He
be
poison
himself
"
---
"
<EOS>
He
have
not
"
---
"
send
for
a
doctor
"

"
He
be
die
"

"
He
be
not
,
he
be
only

---
with
various
other
cry
,
pour
forth
with
bewilder
volubility
,
until
Madame
Mantalini
be
see
to
address
herself
to
Ralph
,
when
female
curiosity
to
know
what
she
would
say
,
prevail
,
and
,
as
if
by
general
consent
,
a
dead
silence
,
unbroken
by
a
single
whisper
,
instantaneously
succeed
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Nickleby
,
"
say
Madame
Mantalini
;
"
by
what
chance
you
come
here
,
I
do
not
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
here
a
gurgle
voice
be
hear
to
ejaculate
,
as
part
of
the
wandering
of
a
sick
man
,
the
word
"
demnition
sweetness
!
"
<EOS>
but
nobody
heed
them
except
the
footman
,
who
,
be
startle
to
hear
such
awful
tone
proceed
,
as
it
be
,
from
between
his
very
finger
,
drop
his
master
's
head
upon
the
floor
with
a
pretty
loud
crash
,
and
then
,
without
an
effort
to
lift
it
up
,
gaze
upon
the
bystander
,
as
if
he
have
do
something
rather
clever
than
otherwise
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
however
,
"
continue
Madame
Mantalini
,
dry
her
eye
,
and
speak
with
great
indignation
,
"
say
before
you
,
and
before
everybody
here
,
for
the
first
time
,
and
once
for
all
,
that
I
never
will
supply
that
man
's
extravagance
and
viciousness
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
dupe
and
a
fool
to
him
long
enough
.
 
<EOS>
in
future
,
he
shall
support
himself
if
he
can
,
and
then
he
may
spend
what
money
he
please
,
upon
whom
and
how
he
please
;
but
it
shall
not
be
mine
,
and
therefore
you
have
well
pause
before
you
trust
him
further
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thereupon
Madame
Mantalini
,
quite
unmoved
by
some
most
pathetic
lamentation
on
the
part
of
her
husband
,
that
the
apothecary
have
not
mix
the
prussic
acid
strong
enough
,
and
that
he
must
take
another
bottle
or
two
to
finish
the
work
he
have
in
hand
,
enter
into
a
catalogue
of
that
amiable
gentleman
's
gallantry
,
deception
,
extravagance
,
and
infidelity
(
especially
the
last
)
,
wind
up
with
a
protest
against
be
suppose
to
entertain
the
small
remnant
of
regard
for
him
;
and
adduce
,
in
proof
of
the
altered
state
of
her
affection
,
the
circumstance
of
his
have
poison
himself
in
private
no
less
than
six
time
within
the
last
fortnight
,
and
her
not

to
save
his
life

I

will

"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Knag
,
who
be
unquestionably
the
old
girl
in
company
,
say
with
great
solemnity
,
that
it
would
be
a
warning
to

and
so
do
the
young
lady
generally
,
with
the
exception

one

two

appear
to
entertain
some
doubt
whether
such

our
next
merry
meeting
!
"
   
<EOS>
so
say
John
Browdie
,
rub
his
hand
with
great
joyousness
,
and
look
round
him
with
a
ruddy
shine
face
,
quite
in
keeping
with
the
declaration
.
   
<EOS>
the
time
at
which
John
find
himself
in
this
enviable
condition
be
the
same
evening
to
which
the
last
chapter
bore
reference
;
the
place
be
the
cottage
;
and
the
assemble
company
be
Nicholas
,
Mrs
Nickleby
,
Mrs
Browdie
,
Kate
Nickleby
,
and
Smike
.
   
<EOS>
a
very
merry
party
they
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Nickleby
,
know
of
her
son
's
obligation
to
the
honest
Yorkshireman
,
have
,
after
some
demur
,
yield
her
consent
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Browdie
be
invite
out
to
tea
;
in
the
way
of
which
arrangement
,
there
be
at
first
sundry
difficulty
and
obstacle
,
arise
out
of
her
not
have
have
an
opportunity
of
"
call
"
upon
Mrs
Browdie
first
;
for
although
Mrs
Nickleby
very
often
observe
with
much
complacency
(
as
most
punctilious
people
do
)
,
that
she
have
not
an
atom
of
pride
or
formality
about
her
,
still
she
be
a
great
stickler
for
dignity
and
ceremony
;
and
as
it
be
manifest
that
,
until
a
call
have
be
make
,
she
could
not
be
(
politely
speak
,
and
accord
to
the
law
of
society
)
even
cognisant
of
the
fact
of
Mrs
Browdie
's
existence
,
she
feel
her
situation
to
be
one
of
peculiar
delicacy
and
difficulty
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
call
MUST
originate
with
me
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
,
"
that
be
indispensable
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
my
dear
,
that
it
be
necessary
there
should
be
a
sort
of
condescension
on
my
part
,
and
that
I
should
show
this
young
person
that
I
be
willing
to
take
notice
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
respectable
-
look
young
man
,
"
add
Mrs
Nickleby
,
after
a
short
consideration
,
"
who
be
conductor
to
one
of
the
omnibus
that
go
by
here
,
and
who
wear
a
glazed
hat
---
<EOS>
your
sister
and
I
have
notice
him
very
often
---
he
have
a
wart
upon
his
nose
,
Kate
,
you
know
,
exactly
like
a
gentleman
's
servant
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
have
all
gentleman
's
servant
wart
upon
their
nose
,
mother
?
"
ask
Nicholas
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nicholas
,
my
dear
,
how
very
absurd
you
be
,
"
return
his
mother
;
"
of
course
I
mean
that
his
glazed
hat
look
like
a
gentleman
's
servant
,
and
not
the
wart
upon
his
nose
;
though
even
that
be
not
so
ridiculous
as
it
may
seem
to
you
,
for
we
have
a
footboy
once
,
who
have
not
only
a
wart
,
but
a
wen
also
,
and
a
very
large
wen
too
,
and
he
demand
to
have
his
wage
raise
in
consequence
,
because
he
find
it
come
very
expensive
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
,
what
be
I
---
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
the
good
way
that
I
can
think
of
would
be
to
send
a
card
,
and
my
compliment
,
(
I
have
no
doubt
he
would
take
'em
for
a
pot
of
porter
,
)
by
this
young
man
,
to
the
Saracen
with
two
Necks
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
waiter
take
him
for
a
gentleman
's
servant
,
so
much
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
then
all
Mrs
Browdie
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
send
her
card
back
by
the
carrier
<EOS>
(
he
could
easily
come
with
a
double
knock
)
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
mother
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
"
I
do
not
suppose
such
unsophisticated
people
as
these
ever
have
a
card
of
their
own
,
or
ever
will
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
that
,
indeed
,
Nicholas
,
my
dear
,
"
return
Mrs
Nickleby
,
"
that
be
another
thing
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
put
it
upon
that
ground
,
why
,
of
course
,
I
have
no
more
to
say
,
than
that
I
have
no
doubt
they
be
very
good
sort
of
person
,
and
that
I
have
no
kind
of
objection
to
their
come
here
to
tea
if
they
like
,
and
shall
make
a
point
of
be
very
civil
to
them
if
they
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
point
be
thus
effectually
set
at
rest
,
and
Mrs
Nickleby
duly
place
in
the
patronising
and
mildly
-
condescend
position
which
become
her
rank
and
matrimonial
year
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Browdie
be
invite
and
come
;
and
as
they
be
very
deferential
to
Mrs
Nickleby
,
and
seem
to
have
a
become
appreciation
of
her
greatness
,
and
be
very
much
pleased
with
everything
,
the
good
lady
have
more
than
once
give
Kate
to
understand
,
in
a
whisper
,
that
she
think
they
be
the
very
good
-
mean
people
she
have
ever
see
,
and
perfectly
well
behave
.
   
<EOS>
and
thus
it
come
to
pass
,
that
John
Browdie
declare
,
in
the
parlour
after
supper
,
to
wit
,
and
twenty
minute
before
eleven
o'clock
p.m.
,
that
he
have
never
be
so
happy
in
all
his
day
.
   
<EOS>
nor
be
Mrs
Browdie
much
behind
her
husband
in
this
respect
,
for
that
young
matron
,
whose
rustic
beauty
contrast
very
prettily
with
the
more
delicate
loveliness
of
Kate
,
and
without
suffer
by
the
contrast
either
<EOS>
,
for
each
serve
as
it
be
to
set
off
and
decorate
the
other
,
could
not
sufficiently
admire
the
gentle
and
win
manner
of
the
young
lady
,
or
the
engage
affability
of
the
eld
one
.
 
<EOS>
then
Kate
have
the
art
of
turn
the
conversation
to
subject
upon
which
the
country
girl
,
bashful
at
first
in
strange
company
,
could
feel
herself
at
home
;
and
if
Mrs
Nickleby
be
not
quite
so
felicitous
at
time
in
the
selection
of
topic
of
discourse
,
or
if
she
do
seem
,
as
Mrs
Browdie
express
it
,
"
rather
high
in
her
notion
,
"
still
nothing
could
be
kind
,
and
that
she
take
considerable
interest
in
the
young
couple
be
manifest
from
the
very
long
lecture
on
housewifery
with
which
she
be
so
obliging
as
to
entertain
Mrs
Browdie
's
private
ear
,
which
be
illustrate
by
various
reference
to
the
domestic
economy
of
the
cottage
,
in
which
(
those
duty
fall
exclusively
upon
Kate
)
the
good
lady
have
about
as
much
share
,
either
in
theory
or
practice
,
as
any
one
of
the
statue
of
the
twelve
Apostles
which
embellish
the
exterior
of
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Browdie
,
"
say
Kate
,
address
his
young
wife
,
"
be
the
best
-
humour
,
the
kind
and
heartiest
creature
I
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
oppress
with
I
do
not
know
how
many
care
,
it
would
make
me
happy
only
to
look
at
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
do
seem
indeed
,
upon
my
word
,
a
most
excellent
creature
,
Kate
,
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
;
"
most
excellent
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
that
at
all
time
it
will
give
me
pleasure
<EOS>
---
really
pleasure
now
---
to
have
you
,
Mrs
Browdie
,
to
see
me
in
this
plain
and
homely
manner
.
 
<EOS>
We
make
no
display
,
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
,
with
an
air
which
seem
to
insinuate
that
they
could
make
a
vast
deal
if
they
be
so
disposed
;
"
no
fuss
,
no
preparation
;
I
would
not
allow
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
Kate
,
my
dear
,
you
will
only
make
Mrs
Browdie
feel
uncomfortable
,
and
how
very
foolish
and
inconsiderate
that
would
be
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
,
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
madam
,
"
return
Mrs
Browdie
,
gratefully
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
nearly
eleven
o'clock
,
John
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
we
be
keep
you
up
very
late
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
late
!
"
cry
Mrs
Nickleby
,
with
a
sharp
thin
laugh
,
and
one
little
cough
at
the
end
,
like
a
note
of
admiration
express
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
quite
early
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
use
to
keep
such
hour
!
 
<EOS>
twelve
,
one
,
two
,
three
o'clock
be
nothing
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
Balls
,
dinner
,
card
-
party
!
<EOS>
never
be
such
rake
as
the
people
about
where
we
use
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
think
now
,
I
be
sure
,
that
how
we
ever
could
go
through
with
<EOS>
it
be
quite
astonishing
,
and
that
be
just
the
evil
of
have
a
large
connection
and
be
a
great
deal
seek
after
,
which
I
would
recommend
all
young
married
people
steadily
to
resist
;
though
of
course
,
and
it
be
perfectly
clear
,
and
a
very
happy
thing
too
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
that
very
few
young
married
people
can
be
expose
to
such
temptation
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
family
in
particular
,
that
use
to
live
about
a
mile
from
us
---
not
straight
down
the
road
,
but
turn
sharp
off
to
the
left
by
the
turnpike
where
the
Plymouth
mail
run
over
the
donkey
---
that
be
quite
extraordinary
people
for
give
the
most
extravagant
party
,
with
artificial
flower
and
champagne
,
and
variegate
lamp
,
and
,
in
short
,
every
delicacy
of
eating
and
drink
that
the
most
singular
epicure
could
possibly
require
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
there
ever
be
such
people
as
those
peltiroguse
.
<EOS>
You
remember
the
Peltiroguses
,
Kate
?
"
   
<EOS>
Kate
see
that
for
the
ease
and
comfort
of
the
visitor
it
be
high
time
to
stay
this
flood
of
recollection
,
so
answer
that
she
entertain
of
the
Peltiroguses
a
most
vivid
and
distinct
remembrance
;
and
then
say
that
Mr
Browdie
have
half
promise
,
early
in
the
evening
,
that
he
would
sing
a
Yorkshire
song
,
and
that
she
be
most
impatient
that
he
should
redeem
his
promise
,
because
she
be
sure
it
would
afford
her
mama
more
amusement
and
pleasure
than
it
be
possible
to
express
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Nickleby
confirm
her
daughter
with
the
good
possible
grace
---
for
there
be
patronage
in
that
too
,
and
a
kind
of
implication
that
she
have
a
discerning
taste
in
such
matter
,
and
be
something
of
a
critic
---
John
Browdie
proceed
to
consider
the
word
of
some
north
-
country
ditty
,
and
to
take
his
wife
's
recollection
respect
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
this
done
,
he
make
diver
ungainly
movement
in
his
chair
,
and
single
out
one
particular
fly
on
the
ceiling
from
the
other
fly
there
asleep
,
fix
his
eye
upon
him
,
and
begin
to
roar
a
meek
sentiment
(
suppose
to
be
utter
by
a
gentle
swain
fast
pine
away
with
love
and
despair
)
in
a
voice
of
thunder
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
first
verse
,
as
though
some
person
without
have
wait
until
then
to
make
himself
audible
,
be
hear
a
loud
and
violent
knocking
at
the
street
-
door
;
so
loud
and
so
violent
,
indeed
,
that
the
lady
start
as
by
one
accord
,
and
John
Browdie
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
some
mistake
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
know
nobody
who
would
come
here
at
this
hour
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Nickleby
surmise
,
however
,
that
perhaps
the
counting
-
house
be
burn
down
,
or
perhaps
"
the
Mr
Cheerybles
"
have
send
to
take
Nicholas
into
partnership
(
which
certainly
appear
highly
probable
at
that
time
of
night
)
,
or
perhaps
Mr
Linkinwater
have
run
away
with
the
property
,
or
perhaps
Miss
La
Creevy
be
take
in
,
or
perhaps
---
   
<EOS>
but
a
hasty
exclamation
from
Kate
stop
her
abruptly
in
her
conjecture
,
and
Ralph
Nickleby
walk
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
stay

"
say
Ralph
,
as
Nicholas
rise
,
and
Kate

make
her
way
towards
him

herself
upon

bite
his
lip

his

in
a
threatening
manner

appear
for
the
moment
unable
to
articulate
a
syllable

Kate
cling
closer
to
his

<EOS>
whose
first
act
be
to
signify
his
intention

put
an
end

his
short
term

happiness

of
consign
him
to
his
old
fate

him
from
the
only
friend
he
have
ever
have

which

yourself

if
Nature
,
in
such
a

one
secret
prompting

him

for
help
this
young
lady
in
the
most
delicate
and
considerate
way
,
and
so
that
her
father
should
not
suspect
the
source
whence
the
aid
be
derive
;
and
how
they
have
at
last
come
to
the
conclusion
,
that
the
good
course
would
be
to
make
a
feint
of
purchase
her
little
drawing
and
ornamental
work
at
a
high
price
,
and
keep
up
a
constant
demand
for
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
furtherance
of
which
end
and
object
it
be
necessary
that
somebody
should
represent
the
dealer
in
such
commodity
,
and
after
great
deliberation
they
have
pitch
upon
Nicholas
to
support
this
character
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
know
me
,
"
say
brother
Charles
,
"
and
he
know
my
brother
Ned
.
<EOS>
neither
of
us
would
do
.
 
<EOS>
Frank
be
a
very
good
fellow
---
a
very
fine
fellow
---
but
we
be
afraid
that
he
may
be
a
little
flighty
and
thoughtless
in
such
a
delicate
matter
,
and
that
he
may
,
perhaps
---
that
he
may
,
in
short
,
be
too
susceptible
(
for
she
be
a
beautiful
creature
,
sir
;
just
what
her
poor
mother
be
)
,
and
fall
in
love
with
her
before
he
know
well
his
own
mind
,
carry
pain
and
sorrow
into
that
innocent
breast
,
which
we
would
be
the
humble
instrument
of
gradually
make
happy
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
an
extraordinary
interest
in
her
fortune
when
he
first
happen
to
encounter
her
;
and
we
gather
from
the
inquiry
we
have
make
of
him
,
that
it
be
she
in
whose
behalf
he
make
that
turmoil
which
lead
to
your
first
acquaintance
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
stammer
out
that
he
have
before
suspect
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
;
and
in
explanation
of
its
have
occur
to
him
,
describe
when
and
where
he
have
see
the
young
lady
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
;
then
you
see
,
"
continued
brother
Charles
,
"
that
he
would
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
Tim
Linkinwater
be
out
of
the
question
;
for
Tim
,
sir
,
be
such
a
tremendous
fellow
,
that
he
could
never
contain
himself
,
but
would
go
to
loggerhead
with
the
father
before
he
have
be
in
the
place
five
minute
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
what
Tim
be
,
sir
,
when
he
be
arouse
by
anything
that
appeal
to
his
feeling
very
strongly
;
then
he
be
terrific
,
sir
,
be
Tim
Linkinwater
,
absolutely
terrific
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
in
you
we
can
repose
the
strict
confidence
;
in
you
we
have
see
---
or
at
least
I
have
see
,
and
that
be
the
same
thing
,
for
there
be
no
difference
between
me
and
my
brother
Ned
,
except
that
he
be
the
fine
creature
that
ever
live
,
and
that
there
be
not
,
and
never
will
be
,
anybody
like
him
in
all
the
world
---
in
you
we
have
see
domestic
virtue
and
affection
,
and
delicacy
of
feeling
,
which
exactly
qualify
you
for
such
an
office

you
be
the
man

"
   
<EOS>
"
the
young

say
Nicholas
,
who
feel
so
embarrassed
that
he

no

anything

"
yes

yes

return
Mr
Cheeryble

"
at

she

that

of
these
little

perhaps
,
if
you

it
very
well
(
that
is

very
well
indeed
)
,
perhaps
she
may
be
bring

that
we
make
a
profit
of
them

<EOS>
eh
?
 
<EOS>
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
in
this
guileless
and
most
kind
simplicity
,
brother
Charles
be
so
happy
,
and
in
this
possibility
of
the
young
lady
be
lead
to
think
that
she
be
under
no
obligation
to
him
,
he
evidently
feel
so
sanguine
and
have
so
much
delight
,
that
Nicholas
would
not
breathe
a
doubt
upon
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
however
,
there
hover
upon
the
tip
of
his
tongue
a
confession
that
the
very
same
objection
which
Mr
Cheeryble
have
state
to
the
employment
of
his
nephew
in
this
commission
apply
with
at
least
equal
force
and
validity
to
himself
,
and
a
hundred
time
<EOS>
have
he
be
upon
the
point
of
avow
the
real
state
of
his
feeling
,
and
entreat
to
be
release
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
often
,
tread
upon
the
heel
of
this
impulse
,
come
another
which
urge
him
to
refrain
,
and
to
keep
his
secret
to
his
own
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
,
"
think
Nicholas
,
"
why
should
I
throw
difficulty
in
the
way
of
this
benevolent
and
high
-
minded
design
?
 
<EOS>
what
<EOS>
if
I
do
love
and
reverence
this
good
and
lovely
creature
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
not
appear
a
most
arrogant
and
shallow
coxcomb
if
I
gravely
represent
that
there
be
any
danger
of
her
fall
in
love
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
besides
,
have
I
no
confidence
in
myself
?
 
<EOS>
be
I
not
now
bind
in
honour
to
repress
these
thought
?
 
<EOS>
have
not
this
excellent
man
a
right
to
my
good
and
heartiest
service
,
and
should
any
consideration
of
self
deter
me
from
render
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
ask
himself
such
question
as
these
,
Nicholas
mentally
answer
with
great
emphasis
"
no
!
"
and
persuade
himself
that
he
be
a
most
conscientious
and
glorious
martyr
,
nobly
resolve
to
do
what
,
if
he
have
examine
his
own
heart
a
little
more
carefully
,
he
would
have
find
he
could
not
resist
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
sleight
of
hand
by
which
we
juggle
with
ourselves
,
and
change
our
very
weakness
into
stanch
and
most
magnanimous
virtue
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cheeryble
,
be
of
course
wholly
unsuspicious
that
such
reflection
be
present
themselves
to
his
young
friend
,
proceed
to
give
him
the
needful
credential
and
direction
for
his
first
visit
,
which
be
to
be
make
next
morning
;
and
all
preliminary
be
arrange
,
and
the
strict
secrecy
enjoin
,
Nicholas
walk
home
for
the
night
very
thoughtfully
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
the
place
to
which
Mr
Cheeryble
have
direct
him
be
a
row
of
mean
and
not
over
-
cleanly
house
,
situate
within
"
the
rule
"
of
the
King
's
Bench
Prison
,
and
not
many
hundred
pace
distant
from
the
obelisk
in
St
George
's
Fields
.
 
<EOS>
the
Rules
be
a
certain
liberty
adjoin
the
prison
,
and
comprise
some
dozen
street
in
which
debtor
who
can
raise
money
to
pay
large
fee
,
from
which
their
creditor
do
not
derive
any
benefit

be
permit
to
reside
by
the
wise
provision

the

enlightened
law
which
leave
the
debtor
who
can
raise
no

starve
in
jail

without

which

provide
for
felon

the
most
atrocious
crime
that
can
disgrace
humanity
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
pleasant
fiction
of
the
law
in
constant
operation
,
but
there
be
not
one
so
pleasant
or
practically
humorous
as
that
which
suppose
every
man
to
be
of
equal
value
in
its
impartial
eye
,
and
the
benefit
of
all
law
to
be
equally
attainable
by
all
man
,
without
the
small
reference
to
the
furniture
of

<EOS>
to

him
by
Mr
Charles
Cheeryble

Nicholas
direct
his
step
,
without
much
trouble
his
head
with
such
matter
as
these
;
and
at
this
row
of
house

after
traverse
a
very
dirty

dusty
suburb

<EOS>

he
at
length
arrive
with
a
palpitate
heart

<EOS>
there
be
small
garden
in
front
which
,
be
wholly
neglect
in
all
other
respect

serve
as
little
pen
for
the
dust

it
down
the
road

open
the
rickety
gate

dangle
on
its
broken
hinge
before
one
of
these

half
admitted

half
repulse
the
visitor
,
Nicholas
knock
at
the
street
door
with
a
faltering
hand
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
truth
a
shabby
house
outside
,
with
very
dim
parlour
window
and
very
small
show
of
blind
,
and
very
dirty
muslin
curtain
dangle
across
the
low
pane
on
very
loose
and
limp
string

<EOS>
neither
,
when
the
door
be
open
,
do
the
inside
appear
to
belie
the
outward
promise
,
as
there
be
fade
carpeting
on
the
stair
and
fade
oil
-
cloth
in
the
passage
;
in
addition
to
which
discomfort
a
gentleman

be
smoke
hard
in
the
front
parlour
(
though
it
be
not
yet
noon

,
while
the
lady

busily
engage
in
turpentine
the
disjoint
fragment
of
a
tent
-
bedstead
at
the
door
of
the
back
parlour
,
as
if
in
preparation
for
the
reception
of
some
new
lodger
who
have
be
fortunate
enough
to
engage
it
.
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
have
ample
time
to
make
these
observation
while
the
little
boy
,
who
go
on
errand
for
the
lodger
,
clatter
down
the
kitchen
stair
and
be
hear
to
scream
,
as
in
some
remote
cellar
,
for
Miss
Bray
's
servant
,
who
,
presently
appear
and
request
him
to
follow
her
,
cause
him
to
evince
great
symptom
of
nervousness
and
disorder
than
so
natural
a
consequence
of
his
have
inquire
for
that
young
lady
would
seem
calculate
to
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
Upstairs
<EOS>
he
go
,
however
,
and
into
a
front
room
he
be
show

there

seat
at
a
little
table
by
the
window

on
which

sit
the
beautiful
girl
who
have
so
engross
his

and
who

surround
by
all
the
new
and
strong
interest
which
Nicholas
attach
to
her
story
,
seem
now
,
in
his
eye
,
a
thousand
time
more
beautiful
than
he
have
ever
yet
suppose
her
.
   
<EOS>
but
how
the
grace
and
elegancie
which
she
have
disperse
about
the
poorly

furnished
room
go
to
the
heart
of
Nicholas

<EOS>
flower

bird
,
the

,
the
old
piano
whose
note
have
sound
so
much
sweet
in
bygone
time
<EOS>
;
how
many
struggle
have
it
cost
her
to
keep
these
two
last
link
of
that
broken
chain
which
bind
her
yet
to
home
!
 
<EOS>
with
every
slender
ornament

the
occupation

her
leisure
hour
,
replete
with
that
graceful

which
linger
in
every

work
of
woman
's
hand
,
how
much
patient
endurance
and
how
many
gentle
affection
be
entwine
!
 
<EOS>
He
feel
as
though
the
smile
of
Heaven
be
on
the
little
chamber
;
as
though
the
beautiful
devotion
of
so
young
and
weak
a
creature
have
shed
a
ray
of
its
own
on
the
inanimate
thing
around
,
and
make
them
beautiful
as
itself

as

the

old

a
sinless

<EOS>
and
yet
Nicholas
be
in
the
Rules
of
the
King

Bench
Prison
!
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
in
Italy
indeed
,
and
the
time
have
be
sunset
,
and
the
scene
a
stately
terrace
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
there
be
one
broad
sky
over
all
the
world
,
and
whether
it
be
blue
or
cloudy
,
the
same
heaven
beyond
it
;
so
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
he
have
no
need
of
compunction
for
thinking
as
he
do
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
he
take
in
everything
at
one
glance
,
for
he
have
as
yet
be
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
a
sick
man
prop
up
with
pillow
in
an
easy
-
chair
,
who
,
move
restlessly
and
impatiently
in
his
seat
,
attract
his
attention
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
scarce
fifty
,
perhaps
,
but
so
emaciated
as
to
appear
much
old
.
 
<EOS>
His
feature
present
the
remain
of
a
handsome
countenance
,
but
one
in
which
the
ember
of
strong
and
impetuous
passion
be
easy
to
be
trace
than
any
expression
which
would
have
render
a
far
plainer
face
much
more
prepossessing
.
 
<EOS>
His
look
be
very
haggard
,
and
his
limb
and
body
literally
wear
to
the
bone
,
but
there
be
something
of
the
old
fire
in
the
large
sunken
eye
notwithstanding
,
and
it
seem
to
kindle
afresh
as
he
strike
a
thick
stick
,
with
which
he
seem
to
have
support
himself
in
his
seat

impatiently
on
the

Newman
Noggs

listen
to
the
chime
of
some
neighbouring
church

and
my
dinner
time
's
two
.
<EOS>
He
do
it
on
purpose

<EOS>
He
make
a
point
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
just
like
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
his
own
little
den
of
an
office
and
on
the
top
of
his
official
stool
that
Newman
thus
soliloquise
;
and
the
soliloquy
refer
,
as
Newman
's
grumble
soliloquy
usually
do
,
to
Ralph
Nickleby
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
he
ever
have
an
appetite
,
"
say
Newman
,
"
except
for
pound
,
shilling
,
and
penny
,
and
with
them
he
be
as
greedy
as
a
wolf
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
have
him
compel
to
swallow
one
of
every
english
coin
.
 
<EOS>
the
penny
would
be
an
awkward
morsel

but
the
crown
---
ha
!
ha
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
good
-
humour
being
in
some
degree
restore
by
the
vision
of
Ralph
Nickleby
swallow
,
perforce
,
a
five
-
shill
piece
,
Newman
slowly
bring
forth
from
his
desk
one
of
those
portable
bottle
,
currently
know
as
pocket
-
pistol
,
and
shake
the
same
close
to
his
ear
so
as
to
produce
a
rippling
sound
very
cool
and
pleasant
to
listen
to
,
suffer
his
feature
to
relax
,
and
take
a
gurgling
drink
,
which
relax
them
still
more
.
 
<EOS>
replace
the
cork
,
he
smack
his
lip
twice
or
thrice
with
an
air
of
great
relish
,
and
,
the
taste
of
the
liquor
have
by
this
time
evaporate
,
recur
to
his
grievance
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
five
minute
to
three

growl
Newman
;
"
it
can
not
want
more
by
this
time

I
have
my
breakfast
at
eight
o'clock

a
breakfast

my

dinner

do
not

<EOS>
these
word
,
though
utter
in
a
very
loud
key
,
be
address
to
nothing
but
empty
air
.
 
<EOS>
the
recital
of
his
wrong
,
however
,
seem
to
have
the
effect
of
make
Newman
Noggs
desperate
;
for
he
flatten
his
old
hat
upon
his
head
,
and
draw
on
the
everlasting
glove
,
declare
with
great
vehemence
,
that
come
what
may
,
he
would
go
to
dinner
that
very
minute
.
   
<EOS>
carry
this
resolution
into
instant
effect
,
he
have
advance
as
far
as
the
passage
,
when
the
sound
of
the
latch
-
key
in
the
street
door
cause
him
to
make
a
precipitate
retreat
into
his
own
office
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
here
he
be
,

growl
Newman
,

with
him

now

will

slip
into

open

up

the
parson
who
make
this
reply

little
old
man

of
about
seventy

seventy
-
five
year
of
age

of
a
very
lean
figure

much
bent

slightly
twist

He

a
grey
coat
with
a
very
narrow
collar

an
old

fashioned
waistcoat
of
rib
black
silk

and
such
scanty
trouser
as
display
his
shrink
spindle
-
shank
in
their
full
ugliness

<EOS>
the
only
article
of
display
or
ornament
in
his
dress
be
a
steel
watch
-
chain
to
which

attach
some
large
gold
seal

and
a
black
ribbon
into

an
old

the
colour
of
a
dry
winter
apple

and
where
his
beard
have
be

there
linger
yet
a
few
grey
tuft
which
seem
,
like
the
ragged
eyebrow
,
to
denote
the
badness
of
the
soil
from
which
they
spring

<EOS>
the
whole
air
and
attitude
of
the
form

stealthy
cat

like
obsequiousness

the
whole
expression
of
the

speak

oh
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
his

it

"
   
<EOS>
naturally
as
this
be
say
,
it
be
not
say
so
naturally
but
that
a
kindred
spirit
like
old
Arthur
Gride
may
have
discern
a
design
upon
the
part
of
Ralph
to
lead
him
on
to
much
more
explicit
statement
and
explanation
than
he
would
have
volunteer
,
or
that
Ralph
could
in
all
likelihood
have
obtain
by
any
other
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Arthur
,
however
,
be
so
intent
upon
his
own
design
,
that
he
suffer
himself
to
be
overreach
,
and
have
no
suspicion
<EOS>
but
that
his
good
friend
be
in
earnest

<EOS>
"
I
know
you
could
not

him

when
you
come

moment

he
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
"
answer
Ralph
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
old
Arthur
Gride
and
matrimony
be
a
most
anomalous
conjunction
of
word
;
old
Arthur
Gride
and
dark
eye
and
eyelash
,
and
lip
that
to
look
at
be
to
long
to
kiss
,
and
cluster
hair
that
he
want
to
play
with
,
and
waist
that
he
want
to
span
,
and
little
foot
that
do
not
tread
upon
anything
---
<EOS>
old
Arthur
Gride
and
such
thing
as
these
be
more
monstrous
still
;
but
old
Arthur
Gride
marry
the
daughter
of
a
ruin
"
dashing
man
"
in
the
Rules
of
the
Bench
,
be
the
most
monstrous
and
incredible
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
plainly
,
friend
Arthur
Gride
,
if
you
want
any
help
from
me
in
this
business
(
which
of
course
you
do
,
or
you
would
not
be
here
)
,
speak
out
,
and
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
above
all
,
do
not
talk
to
me
of
its
turning
to
my
advantage
,
<EOS>
for
I
know
it
must
turn
to
yours
also
,
and
to
a
good
round
tune
too
,
or
you
would
have
no
finger
in
such
a
pie
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
enough
acerbity
and
sarcasm
not
only
in
the
matter
of
Ralph
's
speech
,
but
in
the
tone
of
voice
in
which
he
utter
it
,
and
the
look
with
which
he
eke
it
out
,
to
have
fire
even
the
ancient
usurer
's
cold
blood
and
flush
even
his
withered
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
give
vent
to
no
demonstration
of
anger
,
content
himself
with
exclaim
as
before
,
"
what
a
man
it
be
!
"
and
roll
his
head
from
side
to
side
,
as
if
in
unrestrained
enjoyment
of
his
freedom
and
drollery
.
 
<EOS>
clearly
observe
,
however
,
from
the
expression
in
Ralph
's
feature
,
that
he
have
best
come
to
the
point
as
speedily
as
may
be
,
he
compose
himself
for
more
serious
business
,
and
enter
upon
the
pith
and
marrow
of
his
negotiation
.
   
<EOS>
first
,
he
dwell
upon
the
fact
that
Madeline
Bray
be
devoted
to
the
support
and
maintenance
,
and
be
a
slave
to
every
wish
,
of
her
only
parent
,
who
have
no
other
friend
on
earth
;
to
which
Ralph
rejoin
that
he
have
hear
something
of
the
kind
before
,
and
that
if
she
have
know
a
little
more
of
the
world
,
she
would
not
have
be
such
a
fool
.
   
<EOS>
secondly
,
he
enlarge
upon
the
character
of
her
father
,
argue
,
that
even
take
it
for
grant
that
he
love
her
in
return
with
the
utmost
affection
of
which
he
be
capable
,
yet
he
love
himself
a
great
deal
better
;
which
Ralph
say
it
be
quite
unnecessary
to
say
anything
more
about
,
as
that
be
very
natural
,
and
probable
enough
.
   
<EOS>
and
,
thirdly
,
old
Arthur
premise
that
the
girl
be
a
delicate
and
beautiful
creature
,
and
that
he
have
really
a
hankering
to
have
her
for
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
Ralph
deign
no
other
rejoinder
than
a
harsh
smile
,
and
a
glance
at
the
shrivel
old
creature
before
him
,
which
be
,
however
,
sufficiently
expressive
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
Gride
,
"
for
the
little
plan
I
have
in
my
mind
to
bring
this
about
;
because
,
I
have
not
offer
myself
even
to
the
father
yet
,
I
should
have

look
thoughtfully

they
proceed

sufficient
cogitation

break
silence

it
certainly
could
not

he
use
any
needless
circumlocution

speak
directly

the
purpose

if
you
marry

must
pay
my
debt

full

degree
near

quiet
abstraction

such
result

consent
with

heavy
heart

the
propose
treaty

spot

up
the
bond

exact
the
condition
that
Mr

should
accompany
him
to
Bray
's
lodging
that
very
hour

the
negotiation
at
once

circumstance
appear
auspicious

favourable

I

there

anything

do
you

Hint
a

perhaps
you

me
in

I

about

compliment
to
Nicholas
's
well
nature
,
and
one
which
he
be
very
far
from
deserve
,
to
insinuate
that
the
solution
,
and
such
a
solution
,
of
the
mystery
which
have
seem
to
surround
Madeline
Bray
,
when
he
be
ignorant
even
of
her
name
,
have
damp
his
ardour
or
cool
the
fervour
of
his
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
regard
her
before
,
with
such
a
passion
as
young
man
attract
by
mere
beauty
and
elegance
may
entertain
,
he
be
now
conscious
of
much
deep
and
strong
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
reverence
for
the
truth
and
purity
of
her
heart
,
respect
for
the
helplessness
and
loneliness
of
her
situation
,
sympathy
with
the
trial
of
one
so
young
and
fair
and
admiration
of
her
great
and
noble
spirit
,
all
seem
to
raise
her
far
above
his
reach
,
and
,
while
they
impart
new
depth
and
dignity
to
his
love
,
to
whisper
that
it
be
hopeless
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
keep
my
word
,
as
I
have
pledge
it
to
her
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
manfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
no
common
trust
that
I
have
to
discharge
,
and
I
will
perform
the
double
duty
that
be
impose
upon
me
most
scrupulously
and
strictly
.
 
<EOS>
My
secret
feeling
deserve
no
consideration
in
such
a
case
as
this
,
and
they
shall
have
none
.
"
   
<EOS>
still
,
there
be
the
secret
feeling
in
existence
just
the
same
,
and
in
secret
Nicholas
rather
encourage
them
than
otherwise
;
reasoning
(
if
he
reason
at
all
)
that
there
they
could
do
no
harm
to
anybody
but
himself
,
and
that
if
he
keep
them
to
himself
from
a
sense
of
duty
,
he
have
an
additional
right
to
entertain
himself
with
them
as
a
reward
for
his
heroism
.
   
<EOS>
all
these
thought
,
couple
with
what
he
have
see
that
morning
and
the
anticipation
of
his
next
visit
,
render
him
a
very
dull
and
abstract
companion
;
so
much
so
,
indeed
,
that
Tim
Linkinwater
suspect
he
must
have
make
the
mistake
of
a
figure
somewhere
,
which
be
prey
upon
his
mind
,
and
seriously
conjure
him
,
if
such
be
the
case
,
to
make
a
clean
breast
and
scratch
it
out
,
rather
than
have
his
whole
life
embitter
by
the
torture
of
remorse
.
   
<EOS>
but
in
reply
to
these
considerate
representation
,
and
many
other
both
from
Tim
and
Mr
Frank
,
Nicholas
could
only
be
bring
to
state
that
he
be
never
merry
in
his
life
;
and
so
go
on
all
day
,
and
so
go
towards
home
at
night
,
still
turn
over
and
over
again
the
same
subject
,
think
over
and
over
again
the
same
thing
,
and
arrive
over
and
over
again
at
the
same
conclusion
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
pensive
,
wayward
,
and
uncertain
state
,
people
be
apt
to
lounge
and
loiter
without
know
why
,
to
read
placard
on
the
wall
with
great
attention
and
without
the
small
idea
of
one
word
of
their
content
,
and
to
stare
most
earnestly
through
shop
-
window
at
thing
which
they
do
not
see
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
Nicholas
find
himself
pore
with
the
utmost
interest
over
a
large
play
-
bill
hang
outside
a
Minor
Theatre
which
he
have
to
pass
on
his
way
home
,
and
read
a
list
of
the
actor
and
actress
who
have
promise
to
do
honour
to
some
approach
benefit
,
with
as
much
gravity
as
if
it
have
be
a
catalogue
of
the
name
of
those
lady
and
gentleman
who
stand
highest
upon
the
Book
of
Fate
,
and
he
have
be
look
anxiously
for
his
own

<EOS>
He
glance
at
the
top
of
the
bill
,
with
a
smile
at
his
own
dulness
,
as
he
prepare
to
resume
his
walk
,
and
there
see
announce
,
in
large
letter
with
a
large
space
between

We

whether

return
Crummles

scratch
the
side

I

still
keep
his

on
Nicholas

Mr

shake
his

twice

thrice

profound
gravity

remarking

fold
up

return
Mr

,
solemnly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
such
a
child
as
the
Phenomenon

have
be
a
close

it

<EOS>
"
why

it
be
pretty
sure

something
uncommon

rejoin
Mr

<EOS>
"
the
talent
of
the
other

serious
pantomime

<EOS>
I
should
like
this
one
to
have
a
turn
for
juvenile
tragedy
<EOS>
;
I
understand
they
want
something
of
that
sort
in
America
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
we
must
take
it
as
it
come
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
may
have
a
genius
for
the
tight
-
rope
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
any
sort
of
genius
,
in
short
,
if
it
take
after
its
mother
,
Johnson
,
for
she
be
an
universal
genius
;
but
,
whatever
its
genius
be
,
that
genius
shall
be
develop

himself
after
these
term

Mr
Crummles
put
on
his

from
the
proceed
of
a
tolerably
good
engagement
which
he
have
be
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
,
and
as
he
and
Mrs

scarcely
hope
to
act
for
ever

immortal

in
the
breath
of
Fame

in
a
figurative

he
have
make
up
his

in
the
hope

acquire
some
land

support

that

the

Mr

down

his

He

take
him
a
little
longer
to
wash
himself

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
a
very
unpleasant
line

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

reply
Mr

"
it
come
off
easily
enough

there

only
the

<EOS>
We

once

,

Mr

Timberry
now
appear

in

arm
with
the
African
Swallower

,
be
introduce
to
Nicholas
,
raise
his
hat
half
a
foot
,
and
say
he
be
proud
to
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
Swallower
say
the
same
,
and
look
and
speak
remarkably
like
an
Irishman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
by
the
bill
that
you
have
be
ill
,
sir

"

Nicholas
to
Mr

<EOS>
"
I
hope
you

<EOS>
Mr
Timberry
,
in
reply
,
shake
his
head
with
a
gloomy
air
,
tap
his
chest
several
time
with
great
significancy
,
and
draw
his
cloak
more
closely
about
him
,
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
no

,
no
matter

<EOS>
come

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
observable
that
when
people
upon
the
stage
be
in
any
strait
involve
the
very
last
extremity
of
weakness
and
exhaustion
,
they
invariably
perform
feat
of
strength
require
great
ingenuity
and
muscular
power
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
a
wound
prince
or
bandit
chief
,
who
be
bleed
to
death
and
too
faint
to
move
,
except
to
the
soft
music
(
and
then
only
upon
his
hand
and
knee
)
,
shall
be
see
to
approach
a
cottage
door
for
aid
in
such
a
series
of
writhing
and
twisting
,
and
with
such
curling
up
of
the
leg
,
and
such
rolling
over
and
over
,
and
such
getting
up
and
tumbling
down
again
,
as
could
never
be
achieve
save
by
a
very
strong
man
skilled
in
posture
-
making
.
<EOS>
and
so
natural
do
this
sort
of
performance
come
to
Mr
Snittle
Timberry
,
that
on
their
way
out
of
the
theatre
and
towards
the
tavern
where
the
supper
be
to
be
holden
,
he
testify
the
severity
of
his
recent
indisposition
and
its
waste
effect
upon
the
nervous
system
,
by
a
series
of
gymnastic
performance
which
be
the
admiration
of
all
witness
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
this
be
indeed
a
joy
I
have
not

Mrs

when

be
present

<EOS>
"

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
It
be
by

great

myself
of

"
here
be
one

Mrs

"
Digby

Nicholas

forget
at
the

that
this
have

<EOS>
"
how

"
exclaim
Mrs
Crummles
,
with
a
tragic
recoil
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
shake
his
head
,
and
make
an
attempt
to
smile
,
"
that
your
well

half

be
more

with
him
now
than
ever

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
mean
you

"
rejoin
Mrs
Crummles
,
in
her
most
popular
manner

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whence
come
this
alter
tone

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
a
dastardly
enemy

mine

strike
at
me
through
him

to
torture
me

he
inflict
on

such
agony

terror

suspense

You
will
excuse
me

I
be
sure

Nicholas

check
himself

<EOS>
"
I
should
never
speak
of
this

never

for
a
moment
I
forget
myself

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
with
this
hasty
apology
Nicholas
stoop
down
to
salute
the
Phenomenon
,
and
change
the
subject
;
inwardly
curse
his
precipitation
,
and
very
much
wonder
what
Mrs
Crummles
must
think
of
so
sudden
an
explosion
.
   
<EOS>
that
lady
seem
to
think
very
little
about
it
,
for
the
supper
be
by
this
time
on

she
give
her
hand
to
Nicholas
and
repair
with
a
stately
step
to
the
left

of
Mr

Timberry

<EOS>
Nicholas
have
the
honour
to
support
her
,
and
Mr
Crummles
be
place
upon
the
chairman
's
right
;
the
Phenomenon

the
Master
Crummleses

the
vice

the

<EOS>
It
be
upon

cluster
on

occasion
<EOS>
round
<EOS>
Mr

Timberry
,
there
be
a
literary
gentleman
present
who
have
dramatise
in
his

two
hundred

forty

seven

fast

some

them
faster

<EOS>
this
gentleman
sit

to
whom
he
be
introduce
by
his
friend
the
African
Swallower
,
from
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
with
a
high
eulogium
upon
his
fame
and
reputation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
happy
to
know
a
gentleman
of
such
great
distinction

Nicholas

politely

<EOS>
"
Sir

"
reply
the

"
<EOS>
you
be
very
welcome

do
you

<EOS>

I

Nicholas

with

"
what

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
that

so
Richard

I

<EOS>
"
I
be
about

rejoin
Nicholas

"
that
Shakespeare
derive
some
of
his

it
seem

me
,
that
some
of
the
gentleman
of
your
craft

at
the
present
day

have
shoot
very
far
beyond

"
You
be
quite
right

interrupt
the
literary
gentleman

lean
back
in

<EOS>
"
shot
beyond
him
,
I
mean
,
"
resume
Nicholas
,
"
in
quite
another
respect
,
for
,
whereas
he
bring
within
the
magic
circle
of
his
genius
,
tradition
peculiarly
adapt
for
his
purpose
,
and
turn
familiar
thing
into
constellation
which
should
enlighten
the
world
for
age
<EOS>
,
you
drag
within
the
magic
circle
of
your
dulness
,
subject
not
at
all
adapt
to
the
purpose
of
the
stage
,
and
debase
as
he
exalt
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
you
take
the
uncompleted
book
of
living
author
,
fresh
from
their
hand
,
wet
from
the
press
,
cut
,
hack
,
and
carve
them
to
the
power
and
capacity
of
your
actor
,
and
the
capability
of
your
theatre
,
finish
unfinished
work
,
hastily
and
crudely
vamp
up
idea
not
yet
work
out
by
their
original
projector
,
but
which
have
doubtless
cost
him
many
thoughtful
day
and
sleepless
night
;
by
a
comparison
of
incident
and
dialogue
,
down
to
the
very
last
word
he
may
have
write
a
fortnight
before
,
do
your
utmost
to
anticipate
his
plot
---
all
this
without
his
permission
,
and
against
his
will
;
and
then
,
to
crown
the
whole
proceeding
,
publish
in
some
mean
pamphlet
,
an
unmeaning
farrago
of
garbled
extract
from
his
work
,
to
which
your
name
as
author
,
with
the
honourable
distinction
annex
,
of
have
perpetrate
a
hundred
other
outrage
of
the
same
description
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
show
me
the
distinction
between
such
pilfering
as
this
,
and
pick
a
man

pocket
in
the
street
:
unless

indeed

it
be
,
that
the

a

handkerchiefs

leave

themselves

man

his
shoulder

that
would
be
an
equally
fair
plea

Nicholas

but
if
you
put
it
upon
that
ground

I
have
nothing
more
to

,
that
if
I
be

I
would
rather
pay
your

score

six
month

throw
carelessly
over

then
lift

he
could
not

mark
the
difference
between
their

their
parting
at
Portsmouth

an
air

have

<EOS>
Nicholas

about

a
cheerful

when
he
be
greatly

by
the
sudden

much

apprehension

uncertainty
as
sometimes
to

both

Nicholas
considerable
uneasiness

It

himself
that
thus
disturb

ever

there

bright

the

flush

the

too
thick

heavy
in

,
the

too
feeble

to

<EOS>
there
be
a

which
so
prepare

as

familiar

<EOS>
unearthly

the

so

that
day

,
and
grain

,
the
mortal

waste
and
wither
away
,
so
that
the

grow
light
and
sanguine
with
its
lighten
load
,
and
,
feel
immortality
at
hand
,
deem
it
but
a
new
term
of
mortal
life
;
a
disease
in
which
death
and
life
be
so
strangely
blend
,
that
death
take
the
glow
and
hue
of
life
,
and
life
the
gaunt
and
grisly
form
of
death
;
a
disease
which
medicine
never

,
wealth
never

off

could
boast

<EOS>
It
be
with
some
faint
reference
in
his
own
mind
to
this
disorder
,
though
he
would
by
no
mean
admit
it
,
even
to
himself
,
that
Nicholas
have
already
carry
his
faithful
companion
to
a
physician
of
great
repute
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
cause
for
immediate
alarm
,
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
present
symptom
which
could
be
deem
conclusive
.
 
<EOS>
the
constitution
have
be
greatly
try
and
injure
in
childhood
,
but
still
it
may
not
be
---
and
that
be
all
.
   
<EOS>
but
he
seem
to
grow
no
bad
,
and
,
as
it
be
not
difficult
to
find
a
reason
for
these
symptom
of
illness
in
the
shock
and
agitation
he
have
recently
undergo
,
Nicholas
comfort
himself
with
the
hope
that
his
poor
friend
would
soon
recover
.
 
<EOS>
this
hope
his
mother
and
sister
share
with
him
;
and
as
the
object
of
their
joint
solicitude
seem
to
have
no
uneasiness
or
despondency
for
himself
,
but
each
day
answer
with
a
quiet
smile
that
he
feel
well
than
he
have
upon
the
day
before

their
fear
abate

and
the
general

be
by
degree
restore
.
   
<EOS>
many
and
many
a
time
in
after
year
do
Nicholas
look
back
to
this
period
of
his
life

and
tread
again
the
humble
quiet
homely
scene
that
rise
up
as
of
old
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
many
and
many
a
time
,
in
the
twilight
of
a
summer
evening
,
or
beside
the
flicker
winter
's
fire
---
but
not
so
often
or
so
sadly
then
---
would
his
thought
wander
back
to
these
old
day
,
and
dwell
with
a
pleasant
sorrow
upon
every
slight
remembrance
which
they
bring
crowd
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
room
in
which
they
have
so
often
sit
long
after
it
be
dark
,
figure
such
happy
future
;
Kate
's
cheerful
voice
and
merry
laugh
;
how
,
if
she
be
from
home
,
they
use
to
sit
and
watch
for
her
return
scarcely
break
silence
but
to
say
how
dull
it
seem
without
her
;
the
glee
with
which
poor
Smike
would
start
from
the
darkened
corner
where
he
use
to
sit
,
and
hurry
to
admit
her
,
and
the
tear
they
often
see
upon
his
face
,
half
wonder
to
see
them
too
,
and
he
so
pleased
and
happy
;
every
little
incident
,
and
even
slight
word
and
look
of
those
old
day
little
heeded
then
,
but
well
remember
when
busy
care
and
trial
be
quite
forget
,
come
fresh
and
thick
before
him
many
and
many
a
time
,
and
,
rustle
above
the
dusty
growth
of
year
,
come
back
green
bough
of
yesterday

<EOS>
but
there
be
other
person

with
these
recollection

many
change

before

<EOS>
a
necessary
reflection
for
the
purpose
of
these
adventure
,
which
at
once
subside
into
their
accustomed
train

and
shun
all
flighty
anticipation
or
wayward
wandering
,
pursue
their
steady
and
decorous
course

<EOS>
if
the

as
they
find
Nicholas
worthy
of
trust
and
confidence
,
bestow
upon
him
every
day
some
new
and
substantial
mark
of
kindness
,
they

strongly
disposed
to
be
argumentative
on
the
previous
question

forget
all
about
it
in
a
gush
of
suppose
about
the
coach
she

come
by

suppose
that
the
man
who
drive
must
have
be
either
the
man
in

the
man
with

that

that
no

they

stop
a

House

come
down
;

that
perhaps
be
full
,
they
have
come
straight
on

lastly

that
they

must
have
pass
Nicholas

little
woman
,
look
about
,
after
have
glance
slyly
at
Kate
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
not
be
run
away
with
again
,
have
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
where
be
Mr
Smike
?
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
;
"
he
be
here
this
instant
.
"
   
<EOS>
upon
further
inquiry
,
it
turn
out
,
to
the
good
lady
's
unbounded
astonishment
,
that
Smike
have
,
that
moment
,
go
upstairs
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
now
,
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
,
"
he
be
the
strange
creature
!
 
<EOS>
last
Tuesday
---
be
it
Tuesday
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
to
be
sure
it
be
;
you
recollect
,
Kate
,
my
dear
,
the
very
last
time
<EOS>
young
Mr
Cheeryble
be
here
---
<EOS>
last
Tuesday
night
he
go
off
in
just
the
same
strange
way
,
at
the
very
moment
the
knock
come
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
that
he
do
not
like
company
,
because
he
be
always
fond
of
people
who
be
fond
of
Nicholas
,
and
I
be
sure
young
Mr
Cheeryble
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
strange
thing
be
,
that
he
do
not
go
to
bed
;
therefore
it
can
not
be
because
he
be
tired
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
do
not
go
to
bed
,
because
my
room
be
the
next
one
,
and
when
I
go
upstairs
last
Tuesday
,
hour
after
him
,
I
find
that
he
have
not
even
take
his
shoe
off
;
and
he
have
no
candle
,
so
he
must
have
sit
mope
in
the
dark
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
upon
my
word
,
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
,
"
when
I
come
to
think
of
it
,
that
be
very
extraordinary
!
"
   
<EOS>
as
the
hearer
do
not
echo
this
sentiment
,
but
remain
profoundly
silent
,
either
as
not
know
what
to
say
,
or
as
be
unwilling
to
interrupt
,
Mrs
Nickleby
pursue
the
thread
of
her
discourse
after
her
own
fashion
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
say
that
lady
,
"
that
this
unaccountable
conduct
may
not
be
the
beginning
of
his
taking
to
his
bed
and
live
there
<EOS>
all
his
life
,
like
the
Thirsty
Woman

Tutbury

the
Cock

Ghost

some
of
those
extraordinary
creature
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
have
some
connection
with
our
family

<EOS>
I
forget
,
without
look
back
to
some
old
letter
I
have
upstair
,
whether
it
be
my
great

grandfather
who
go
to
school
with
the
Cock

the
Thirsty

<EOS>
Miss
La

,
you
know

of
course

<EOS>
which
be
it
that
do
not

what
the

the

<EOS>
"
the
Cock

Ghost
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
I
have
no

"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
,
"
that
it
be
with
him

my
great
-
grandfather
go
to
school

for
I
know
the
master

his
school
be
a
dissenter

that
would
,
in
a
great
measure

account
for
the

behaving

such
an
improper

up

ah
!
 
<EOS>
train
up
a
ghost

child

I

"
   
any
further
reflection
on
this
fruitful
theme
be
abruptly
cut
short
by
the
arrival
of
Tim
Linkinwater
and
Mr
Frank
Cheeryble
;
in
the
hurry
of
receive
whom

Mrs

speedily
lose
sight

everything

"
I
be
so
sorry
Nicholas

Mrs

"
Kate

you

both

if
I

oppose
all

then
at

she

press
you
to

return
Mrs

<EOS>
"
Mr
Linkinwater
say
ten
minute
,
but
I
can
not
let
you
go
so
soon
<EOS>
;
Nicholas
would
be
very
much
vexed
,
I
be
sure
.

Kate

my

"
   
<EOS>
in
obedience
to
a
great
number
of
nod
,
and
winks
,
and
frown
of
extra
significance
,
Kate
add
her
entreaty
that
the
visitor
would
remain
;
but
it
be
observable
that
she
address
them
exclusively
to
Tim
Linkinwater
;
and
there
be
,
besides
,
a
certain
embarrassment
in
her
manner
,
which
,
although
it
be
as
far
from
impair
its
graceful
character
as
the
tinge
it
communicate
to
her
cheek
be
from
diminish
her
beauty
,
be
obvious
at
a
glance
even
to
Mrs
Nickleby
.
 
<EOS>
not
be
of
a
very
speculative
character
,
however
,
save
under
circumstance
when
her
speculation
could
be
put
into
word
and
utter
aloud
,
that
discreet
matron
attribute
the
emotion
to
the
circumstance
of
her
daughter
's
not
happen
to
have
her
good
frock
on
:
"
though
I
never
see
her
look
well
,
certainly
,
"
she
reflect
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
have
settle
the
question
in
this
way
,
and
be
most
complacently
satisfied
that
in
this
,
and
in
all
other
instance
,
her
conjecture
could
not
fail
to
be
the
right
one
,
Mrs
Nickleby
dismiss
it
from
her
thought
,
and
inwardly
congratulate
herself
on
be
so
shrewd
and
know
.
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
do
not
come
home
nor
do
Smike
reappear
;
but
neither
circumstance
,
to
say
the
truth
,
have
any
great
effect
upon
the
little
party
,
who
be
all
in
the
good
humour
possible
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
spring
up
quite
a
flirtation
between
Miss
La
Creevy
and
Tim
Linkinwater
,
who
say
a
thousand
jocose
and
facetious
thing
,
and
become
,
by
degree
,
quite
gallant
,
not
to
say
tender
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Miss
La
Creevy
,
on
her
part
,
be
in
high
spirit
,
and
rally
Tim
on
have
remain
a
bachelor
all
his
life
with
so
much
success
,
that
Tim
be
actually
induce
to
declare
,
that
if
he
could
get
anybody
to
have
him
,
he
do
not
know
but
what
he
may
change
his
condition
even
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
La
Creevy
earnestly
recommend
a
lady
she
know
,
who
would
exactly
suit
Mr
Linkinwater
,
and
have
a
very
comfortable
property
of
her
own
;
but
this
latter
qualification
have
very
little
effect
upon
Tim
,
who
manfully
protest
that
fortune
would
be
no
object
with
him
,
but
that
true
worth
and
cheerfulness
of
disposition
be
what
a
man
should
look
for
in
a
wife
,
and
that
if
he
have
these
,
he
could
find
money
enough
for
the
moderate
want
of
both
.
 
<EOS>
this
avowal
be
consider
so
honourable
to
Tim
,
that
neither
Mrs
Nickleby
nor
Miss
La
Creevy
could
sufficiently
extol
it
;
and
stimulate
by
their
praise
,
Tim
launch
out
into
several
other
declaration
also
manifest
the
disinterestedness
of
his
heart
,
and
a
great
devotion
to
the
fair
sex
:
which
be
receive
with
no
less
approbation
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
do
and
say
with
a
comical
mixture
of
jest
and
earnest
,
and
,
lead
to
a
great
amount
of
laughter
,
make
them
very
merry
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
Kate
be
commonly
the
life
and
soul
of
the
conversation
at
home
;
but
she
be
more
silent
than
usual
upon
this
occasion
<EOS>
(
perhaps
because
Tim
and
Miss
La
Creevy
engross
so
much
of
it
)
,
and
,
keep
aloof
from
the
talker
,
sit
at
the
window
watch
the
shadow
as
the
evening
close
in
,
and
enjoy
the
quiet
beauty
of
the
night
,
which
seem
to
have
scarcely
less
attraction
to
Frank
,
who
first
linger
near
,
and
then
sit
down
beside
,
her
.
 
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
there
be
a
great
many
thing
to
be
say
appropriate
to
a
summer
evening
,
and
no
doubt
they
be
good
say
in
a
low
voice
,
as
be
most
suitable
to
the
peace
and
serenity
of
the
hour
;
long
pause
,
too
,
at
time
,
and
then
an
earnest
word
or
so
,
and
then
another
interval
of
silence
which
,
somehow
,
do
not
seem
like
silence
either
,
and
perhaps
now
and
then
a
hasty
turn
away
of
the
head
,
or
drooping
of
the
eye
towards
the
ground
,
all
these
minor
circumstance
,
with
a
disinclination
to
have
candle
introduce
and
a
tendency
to
confuse
hour
with
minute
,
be
doubtless
mere
influence
of
the
time
,
as
many
lovely
lip
can
clearly
testify
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be
there
the
slight
reason
why
Mrs
Nickleby
should
have
express
surprise
when
,
candle
be
at
length
bring
in
,
Kate
's
bright
eye
be
unable
to
bear
the
light
which
oblige
her
to
avert
her
face
,
and
even
to
leave
the
room
for
some
short
time
;
because
,
when
one
have
sit
in
the
dark
so
long
,
candle
are
dazzling
,
and
nothing
can
be
more
strictly
natural
than
that
such
result
should
be
produce
,
as
all
well
-
inform
young
people
know
.
 
<EOS>
for
that
matter
,
old
people
know
it
too
,
or
do
know
it
once
,
but
they
forget
these
thing
sometimes
,
and
more
be
the
pity
.
   
<EOS>
the
good
lady
's
surprise
,
however
,
do
not
end
here
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
greatly
increase
when
it
be
discover
that
Kate
have
not
the
least
appetite
for
supper
:
<EOS>
a
discovery
so
alarming
that
there
be
no
knowing
in
what
unaccountable
effort
of
oratory
Mrs
Nickleby
's
apprehension
may
have
be
vent
,
if
the
general
attention
have
not
be
attract
,
at
the
moment
,
by
a
very
strange
and
uncommon
noise
,
proceeding
,
as
the
pale
and
tremble
servant
girl
affirm
,
and
as
everybody
's
sense
of
hearing
seem
to
affirm
also
,
"
right
down
"
the
chimney
of
the
adjoining
room
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
quite
plain
to
the
comprehension
of
all
present
that
,
however
extraordinary
and
improbable
<EOS>
it
may
appear
,
the
noise
do
nevertheless
proceed
from
the
chimney
in
question
;
and
the
noise
(
which
be
a
strange
compound
of
various
shuffling
,
slide
,
rumble
,
and
struggle
sound
,
all
muffle
by
the
chimney
)
still
continue
,
Frank
Cheeryble
catch
up
a
candle
,
and
Tim
Linkinwater
the
tong
,
and
they
would
have
very
quickly
ascertain
the
cause
of
this
disturbance
if
Mrs
Nickleby
have
not
be
take
very
faint
,
and
decline
be
leave
behind
,
on
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
this
produce
a
short
remonstrance
,
which
terminate
in
their
all
proceeding
to
the
troubled
chamber
in
a
body
,
except
only
Miss
La
Creevy
,
who
,
as
the
servant
girl
volunteer
a
confession
of
have
be
subject
to
fit
in
her
infancy

remain
with
her
to
give
the
alarm
and
apply
restorative
,
in
case
of
extremity
.
   
<EOS>
advance
to
the
door
of
the
mysterious
apartment

they
be
not
a
little
surprised
to
hear
a
human
voice
,
chant
with
a
highly
elaborate
expression
of
melancholy
,
and
in
tone
of
suffocation
which
a
human
voice
may
have
produce
from
under
five

six
feather

of
the
good
quality

popular
air

her
truth

beautiful
maid
I
adore

<EOS>
nor
,
on
burst
into
the
room
without
demand
a
parley
,
be
their
astonishment
lessen
by
the
discovery
that
these
romantic
sound
certainly
proceed
from
the
throat
of
some
man
up
the
chimney
,
of
whom
nothing
be
visible
but
a
pair
of
leg

which

dangle
above
the
grate

apparently
feel
,
with
extreme
anxiety
,
for
the
top
bar
whereon

effect
a
landing

<EOS>
a
sight
so
unusual

unbusiness

like
as
this

completely
paralyse
Tim

who

after
one
or
two
gentle
pinche
at
the
stranger

ankle

this

with
great
indignation

he
raise
the
candle
to
obtain
a
well
view
of
the
leg

and
be
dart
forward
to
pull
them
down
with
very
little
ceremony

when
Mrs
Nickleby

clasp
her
hand
,
utter
a
sharp
sound

something
between
a
scream

an
exclamation

whether
the
mysterious
limb

small

down

desperate

you

exceedingly
respectful

It

a
very
hard
case

hard

anything

be
ever
expose
to
,
before
I
marry
your
poor
dear
papa

though
I
suffer
a
good
deal
of
annoyance
then

but
that
,
of
course

I
expect

make
up
my

<EOS>
when
I

there

Frank

in
irrepressible
astonishment

<EOS>
first
at

then
at
Kate

feel
that
some
explanation

who

her
terror
at
the
apparition

her
fear

her
anxiety

ridiculous

It

so
easy
to

a

of

Mrs

foot
up

violently

a
change

his

twenty

thirty
time

subside
into
an
ecstatic
contemplation
of
Miss

charm

this
afford
Mrs

a
favourable
opportunity

explanation

go
about

straight

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure

with
a
prefatory
cough

that
it
be
a
great
relief
,
under
such
try
circumstance
as
these

to
have
anybody
else
mistake
for
me

a
very
great
relief

it
be
a
circumstance
that
never

I
have
several
time
be
mistaken
for
my
daughter

I
have
no
doubt
the
people
be
very
foolish

perhaps
ought
to
have
know
better

still
they
do
take
me
for
her
,

of
course
that
be
no
fault

mine

it
would
be
very
hard
indeed

I
be
to
be
make
responsible
for
it

<EOS>
however
,
in
this
instance

of
course

I
must
feel
that
I
should
do
exceedingly
wrong

suffer
anybody

especially
anybody

I
be
under
great
obligation

to
be
make
uncomfortable

yawn

leisurely
turn
back

there
be
not
a
little
tact

knowledge

young
lord

disposition
in
this
mode
of
treat
him

Sir
Mulberry
clearly
see
that
if
his
dominion
be
to
last
,
it
must
be
establish
now

<EOS>
He
know
that
the
moment
he
become
violent
,
the
young
man
would
become
violent
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
,
many
time
,
be
enable
to
strengthen
his
influence
,
when
any
circumstance
have
occur
to
weaken
it
,
by
adopt
this
cool
and
laconic
style
;
and
he
trust
to
it
now
,
with
very
little
doubt
of
its
entire
success
.
   
<EOS>
but
while
he
do
this
,
and
wear
the
most
careless
and
indifferent
deportment
that
his
practised
art
enable
him
to
assume
,
he
inwardly
resolve
,
not
only
to
visit
all
the
mortification
of
be
compel
to
suppress
his
feeling
,
with
additional
severity
upon
Nicholas

also
to
make
the
young

pay
dearly
for
it
,
one
day
,
in
some
shape

other

<EOS>
so
long
as
he
have
be
a
passive
instrument
in
his
hand

Sir

have
regard
him
with
no
other
feeling
than
contempt
;
but
,
now
that
he
presume
to
avow
opinion
in
opposition
to
his
,
and
even
to
turn
upon
him
with
a
lofty
tone
and
an
air
of
superiority

begin
to
hate
him

<EOS>
conscious
that
,
in
the
vile

most
worthless
sense
of
the
term

he
be
dependent

weak
young
lord
,
Sir
Mulberry
could
the
less
brook
humiliation
at
his
hand
;
and
when
he
begin
to
dislike
him
he
measure
his
dislike
---
as
man
often
do
---
by
the
extent
of
the
injury
he
have
inflict
upon
its
object
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
remember
that
Sir
Mulberry
Hawk
have
plunder
,
dupe
,
deceive
,
and
fool
his
pupil
in
every
possible
way
,
it
will
not
be
wonder
at
,
that
,
begin
to
hate
him
,
he
begin
to
hate
him
cordially
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
young
lord
have
think
---
which
he
very
seldom
do
about
anything
---
and
seriously
too
,
upon
the
affair
with
Nicholas
,
and
the
circumstance
which
lead
to
it
,
have
arrive
at
a
manly
and
honest
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Mulberry
's
coarse
and
insult
behaviour
on
the
occasion
in
question
have
produce
a
deep
impression
on
his
mind
;
a
strong
suspicion
of
his
have
lead
him
on
to
pursue
Miss
Nickleby
for
purpose
of
his
own
,
have
be
lurk
there
for
some
time
;
he
be
really
ashamed
of
his
share
in
the
transaction
,
and
deeply
mortify
by
the
misgiving
that
he
have
be
gull
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
have
sufficient
leisure
to
reflect
upon
these
thing
,
during
their
late
retirement
;
and
,
at
time
,
when
his
careless
and
indolent
nature
would
permit
,
have
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
slight
circumstance
,
too
,
have
occur
to
increase
his
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
It
want
but
<EOS>
a
very
slight
circumstance
to
kindle
his
wrath
against
Sir
Mulberry
.
 
<EOS>
this
his
disdainful
and
insolent
tone
in
their
recent
conversation
<EOS>
(
the
only
one
they
have
hold
upon
the
subject
since
the
period
to
which
Sir
Mulberry
refer
)
,
effect
.
   
<EOS>
thus
they
rejoin
their
friend
:
each
with
cause
of
dislike
against
the
other
rankling
in
his
breast
:
and
the
young
man
haunt
,
besides
,
with
thought
of
the
vindictive
retaliation
which
be
threaten
against
Nicholas
,
and
the
determination
to
prevent
it
by
some
strong
step
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Mulberry
,
conceive
that
he
have
silence
him
effectually
,
could
not
suppress
his
triumph
,
or
forbear
from
follow
up
what
he
conceive
to
be
his
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pyke
be
there
,
and
Mr
Pluck
be
there
,
and
Colonel
Chowser
,
and
other
gentleman
of
the
same
caste
,
and
it
be
a
great
point
for
Sir
Mulberry
to
show
them
that
he
have
not
lose
his
influence
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
the
young
lord
content
himself
with
a
silent
determination
to
take
measure
for
withdraw
himself
from
the
connection
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
,
he
grow
more
angry
,
and
be
exasperate
by
jest
and
familiarity
which
,
a
few
hour
before
,
would
have
be
a
source
of
amusement
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
do
not
serve
him
;
for
,
at
such
bantering
or
retort
as
suit
the
company
,
he
be
no
match
for
Sir
Mulberry
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
no
violent
rupture
take
place
.
<EOS>
They
return
to
town
;
Messrs
Pyke
and
Pluck
and
other
gentleman
frequently
protest
,
on
the
way
thither
,
that
Sir
Mulberry
have
never
be
in
such
tiptop
spirit
in
all
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
They
dine
together
,
sumptuously
.
 
<EOS>
the
wine
flow
freely
,
as
indeed
it
have
do
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Mulberry
drink
to
recompense
himself
for
his
recent
abstinence
;
the
young
lord
,
to
drown
his
indignation
;
and
the
remainder
of
the
party
,
because
the
wine
be
of
the
good
and
they
have
nothing
to
pay
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
midnight
when
they
rush
out
,
wild
,
burn
with
wine
,
their
blood
boiling
,
and
their
brain
on
fire
,
to
the
gaming
-
table
.
   
<EOS>
here
,
they
encounter
another
party
,
mad
like
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
the
excitement
of
play
,
hot
room
,
and
glaring
light
be
not
calculate
to
allay
the
fever
of
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
giddy
whirl
of
noise
and
confusion
,
the
man
be
delirious
.
 
<EOS>
who
think
of
money
,
ruin
,
or
the
morrow
,
in
the
savage
intoxication
of
the
moment
?
 
<EOS>
More
wine
be
call
for
,
glass
after
glass
be
drain
,
their
parch
and
scald
mouth
be
crack
with
thirst
.
 
<EOS>
down
pour
the
wine
like
oil
on
blaze
fire
.
 
<EOS>
and
still
the
riot
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
the
debauchery
gain
its
height
;
glass
be
dash
upon
the
floor
by
hand
that
could
not
carry
them
to
lip
;
oath
be
shout
out
by
lip
which
could
scarcely
form
the
word
to
vent
them
in
;
drunken
loser
curse
and
roar
;
some
mount
on
the
table
,
wave
bottle
above
their
head
and
bid
defiance
to
the
rest
;
some
dance
,
some
sing
,
<EOS>
some
tear
the
card
and
rave
.
 
<EOS>
Tumult
and
frenzy
reign
supreme
;
when
a
noise
arise
that
drown
all
other
,
and
two
man
,
seize
each
other
by
the
throat
,
struggle
into
the
middle
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
a
dozen
voice
,
until
now
unheard
,
call
aloud
to
part
them
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
have
keep
themselves
cool
,
to
win
,
and
who
earn
their
living
in
such
scene
,
throw
themselves
upon
the
combatant
,
and
,
force
them
asunder
,
drag
them
some
space
apart
.
   
<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
cry
Sir
Mulberry
,
in
a
thick
hoarse
voice
;
"

<EOS>
I

"
I

one
of
those

<EOS>
"
tomorrow

the

<EOS>
"
It

"
<EOS>
cry
Sir
Mulberry
.
 
<EOS>
"
tonight

at

"
 
<EOS>
His
passion
be
so
great
,
that
he
could
not
articulate
,
but
stand
clench
his
fist
,
tear
his
hair
,
and
stamp
upon
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
this
,
my
lord
?
"
say
one
of
those
who
surround
him

I

be

<EOS>
Captain
Adams
,
"
say
the
young
lord
,
look
hurriedly
about
him
,
and
address
one
of
those
who
have
interpose
,
"
let
me
speak
with
you
,
I
beg
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
person
address
step
forward
,
and
take
the
young
man
's
arm
,
they
retire
together
,
follow
shortly
afterwards
by
Sir
Mulberry
and
his
friend
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
profligate
haunt
of
the
bad
repute
,
and
not
a
place
in
which
such
an
affair
be
likely
to
awaken
any
sympathy
for
either
party
,
or
to
call
forth
any
further
remonstrance
or
interposition
.
<EOS>
elsewhere
,
its
further
progress
would
have
be
instantly
prevent
,
and
time
allow
for
sober
and
cool
reflection
;
but
not
there
.
<EOS>
disturb
in
their
orgy
,
the
party
break
up
;
some
reel
away
with
look
of
tipsy
gravity
;
other
withdraw
noisily
discuss
what
have
just
occur
;
the
gentleman
of
honour
who
live
upon
their
winning
remark
to
each
other
,
as
they
go
out
,
that
Hawk
be
a
good
shot
;
and
those
who
have
be
most
noisy
,
fall
fast
asleep
upon
the
sofa
,
and
think
no
more
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
two
second
,
as
they
may
be
call
now
,
after
a
long
conference
,
each
with
his
principal
,
meet
together
in
another
room
.
<EOS>
both
utterly
heartless
,
both
man
upon
town
,
both
thoroughly
initiate
in
its
bad
vice
,
both
deeply
in
debt
,
<EOS>
both
fall
from
some
high
estate
,
both
addict
to
every
depravity
for
which
society
can
find
some
genteel
name
and
plead
its
most
depraving
conventionality
as
an
excuse
,
they
be
naturally
gentleman
of
most
unblemished
honour
themselves
,
and
of
great
nicety
concern
the
honour
of
other
people
.
   
<EOS>
these
two
gentleman
be
unusually
cheerful
just
now
;
for
the
affair
be
pretty
certain
to
make
some
noise
,
and
could
scarcely
fail
to
enhance
their
reputation
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
an
awkward
affair
,
Adams
,
"
say
Mr
Westwood
,
draw
himself
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
very
,
"
return
the
captain
;
"
a
blow
have
be
strike
,
and
there
be
but
one
course
,
of
course
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
apology
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
Mr
Westwood
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
a
syllable
,
sir
,
from
my
man
,
if
we
talk
till
doomsday
,
"
return
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
original
cause
of
dispute
<EOS>
,
I
understand
,
be
some
girl
or
other
,
to
whom
your
principal
apply
certain
term
,
which
Lord
Frederick
,
defend
the
girl
,
repel
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
lead
to
a
long
recrimination
upon
a
great
many
sore
subject
,
charge
,
and
counter
-
charge
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Mulberry
be
sarcastic
;
Lord
Frederick
be
excited
,
and
strike
him
in
the
heat
of
provocation
,
and
under
circumstance
of
great
aggravation
.
 
<EOS>
that
blow
,
unless
there
be
a
full
retraction
on
the
part
of
Sir
Mulberry
,
Lord
Frederick
be
ready
to
justify
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
more
to
be
say
,
"
return
the
other
,
"
but
to
settle
the
hour
and
the
place
of
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
responsibility
;
but
there
be
a
strong
feeling
to
have
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
object
to
say
at
sunrise
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
sharp
work
,
"
reply
the
captain
,
refer
to
his
watch
;
"
however
,
as
this
seem
to
have
be
a
long
time
breeding
,
and
negotiation
be
only
a
waste
of
word
,
no
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
something
may
possibly
be
say
,
out
of
door
,
after
what
pass
in
the
other
room
,
which
render
it
desirable
that
we
should
be
off
without
delay
,
and
quite
clear
of
town
,
"
say
Mr
Westwood
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
to
one
of
the
meadow
opposite
Twickenham
,
by
the
river
-
side
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
captain
see
no
objection
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
join
company
in
the
avenue
of
tree
which
lead
from
Petersham
to
Ham
House

settle
the
exact
spot
when
we
arrive
there

say
Mr
Westwood
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
the
captain
also
assent
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
few
other
preliminary
,
equally
brief
,
and
have
settle
the
road
each
party
should
take
to
avoid
suspicion

separate

<EOS>
"
We
shall
just
have
comfortable
time
,
my
lord

the
captain
,
when
he
have
communicate
the
arrangement
,
"
to
call
at
my
room
for
a
case
of
pistol

jog
coolly
down
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
allow
me
to
dismiss
your
servant

we
will
take
my
cab
;
for
yours

perhaps
,
may
be
recognise

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
what
a
contrast
,
when
they
reach
the
street
,
to
the
scene
they
have
just
leave
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
already
daybreak
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
flare
yellow
light
within
,
be
substitute
the
clear

bright

glorious
morning

for
a
hot

close
atmosphere

taint
with
the
smell
of
expire
lamp
,
and
reek
with
the
steam
of
riot
and
dissipation
,
the
free
,
fresh
,
wholesome
air
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
the
fevered
head
on
which
that
cool
air
blow
,
it
seem
to
come
laden
with
remorse
for
time
misspent
and
countless
opportunity
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
with
throb
vein
and
burn
skin
,
eye
wild
and
heavy
,
thought
hurry
and
disorder
,
he
feel
as
though
the
light
be
a
reproach
,
and
shrink
involuntarily
from
the
day
as
if
he
be
some
foul
and
hideous
thing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shivering
?
"

the
captain

<EOS>
"
You

so
,
so
;
now
we
be
off

"
   
<EOS>
They
rattle
through
the
quiet
street
,
make
their
call
at
the
captain
's
lodging
,
clear
the
town
,
and
emerge
upon
the
open
road
,
without
hindrance
or
molestation
.
   
<EOS>
field
,
tree
,
garden
,
hedge
,
everything
look
very
beautiful
;
the
young
man
scarcely
seem
to
have
notice
them
before
,
though
he
have
pass
the
same
object
a
thousand
time
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
peace
and
serenity
upon
them
all
,
strangely
at
variance
with
the
bewilderment
and
confusion
of
his
own
half
-
sober
thought
,
and
yet
impressive
and
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
fear
upon
his
mind
;
but
,
as
he
look
about
him
,
he
have
less
anger
;
and
though
all
old
delusion
,
relative
to
his
worthless
late
companion
,
be
now
clear
away
,
he
rather
wish
he
have
never
know
him
than
thought
of
its
have
come
to
this
.
   
<EOS>
the
past
night
,
the
day
before
,
and
many
other
day
and
night
beside
,
all
mingle
themselves
up
in
one
unintelligible
and
senseless
whirl
;
he
could
not
separate
the
transaction
of
one
time
from
those
of
another
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
the
noise
of
the
wheel
resolve
itself
into
some
wild
tune
in
which
he
could
recognise
scrap
of
air
he
know
;
now
,
there
be
nothing
in
his
ear
but
a
stunning
and
bewildering
sound
,
like
rush
water
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
companion
rally
him
on
be
so
silent
,
and
they
talk
and
laugh
boisterously
.
<EOS>
when
they
stop
,
he
be
a
little
surprised
to
find
himself
in
the
act
of
smoking
;
but
,
on
reflection
,
he
remember
when
and
where
he
have
take
the
cigar
.

<EOS>
Nicholas
need
encouragement

<EOS>
the
suddenness
with
which
intelligence
of
the
two
usurer

plan
have
come
upon
him
,
the
little
time
which
remain
for

the
probability

almost
amount
to

itself

that
a
few

would
place
Madeline

beyond
his

consign
her
to
unspeakable
misery

and
perhaps
to
an
untimely
death

all
this
quite
stunned

overwhelm
him

<EOS>
every
hope
connect
with
her
that
he
have
suffer
himself
to
form
,
or
have
entertain
unconsciously

seem

every

dart
off

It
be
with
a
very
melancholy
laugh

Newman
Noggs
conclude
this
soliloquy
;

it
be
with
a
very
melancholy
shake
of
the
head

a
very
rueful
countenance

that
he
turn
about

go
plod
on

<EOS>
this
,
under
ordinary
circumstance

would
have
be
to
some
small
tavern

dram
-
shop
;
that
be
his
way
,
in
more
sense
than
one
.
<EOS>
but
,
Newman
be
too
much
interested
,
and
too
anxious
,
to
betake
himself
even
to
this
resource
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
with
many
desponding
and
dismal
reflection
,
go
straight
home

<EOS>
It
have
come
to
pass
,
that
afternoon

that
Miss
Morleena
Kenwigs
have
receive
an
invitation
to
repair
next
day
,
per
steamer
from
Westminster
Bridge

unto

pie
island
at

:
there
to

convey
thither
for
the
purpose

:
the
steamer
be

a

master
of
extensive
connection
for
the
accommodation

his
numerous
pupil

and
the
pupil
display
their
appreciation
of
the

induce
their

<EOS>
of
these
light

blue
ticket
,
one
have
be
present
by
an
ambitious
neighbour
to
Miss
Morleena
Kenwigs
,
with
an
invitation
to
join
her
daughter
;
and
Mrs
Kenwigs
,
rightly
deem
that
the
honour

the
family
be

in
Miss
Morleena

make
the
most
splendid
appearance
possible
on
so
short
a

be
still
hard
at
work
when
Newman
Noggs
come
home

<EOS>
now
,
between
the
italian

ironing
of
frill
,
the
flouncing
of
trouser
,
the
trimming
of
frock
,
the
fainting
and
the
coming

to

,
incidental
to
the
occasion
,
Mrs
Kenwigs
have
be
so
entirely
occupy
,
that
she
have
not
observe
,
until
within
half
an
hour
before
,
that
the
flaxen
tail
of
Miss
Morleena
's
hair
be
,
in
a
manner
,
run
to
seed
;
and
that
,
unless
she
be
put
under
the
hand
of
a
skilful
hairdresser
<EOS>
,
she
never
could
achieve
that
signal
triumph
over
the
daughter

all
other
people

anything
less
than
which
would
be
tantamount
to
defeat

<EOS>
this
discovery
drive
Mrs
Kenwigs
to
despair
;
for
the
hairdresser
live
three
street
and
eight
dangerous
crossing
off
;
Morleena
could
not
be
trust
to
go
there
alone
,
even
if
such
a
proceeding
be
strictly
proper
:
of
which
Mrs
Kenwigs
have
her
doubt
;
Mr
Kenwigs
have
not
return
from
business
;
and
there
be
nobody
to
take
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
Mrs
Kenwigs
first
slap
Miss
Kenwigs
for
be
the
cause
of
her
vexation
,
and
then
shed
tear
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

"
I
can

Morleena

also
in

"
my

<EOS>
"
do

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
deplore
the
evil

of
her

daughter
in
these

Mrs

distil
fresh
drop
of
vexation
from
her
eye

and
declare
that
she
do
believe
there
never

try
as

<EOS>
Thereupon
,
Morleena
Kenwigs
weep
afresh

they
bemoan
themselves
together

<EOS>
matter
be
at
this
point
,
as
Newman
Noggs
be
hear
to
limp
past
the
door
on
his
way
upstairs
;
when
Mrs
Kenwigs
,
gain
new
hope
from
the
sound
of
his
footstep
,
hastily
remove
from
her
countenance
as
many
trace
of
her
late
emotion
as
be
effaceable
on
so
short
a
notice
:
and
present
herself
before
him
,
and
represent
their
dilemma
,
entreat
that
he
would
escort
Morleena
to
the
hairdresser

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
I

I
think
there

lowness

"
   
<EOS>
Newman
be
too
good
-
natured
not
to
have
consent
,
even
without
this
avowal
of
confidence
on
the
part
of
Mrs
Kenwigs
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
a
very
few
minute
have
elapse
,
when
he
and
Miss
Morleena
be
on
their
way
to
the
hairdresser
's
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
exactly
a
hairdresser
's
;
that
be
to
say
,
people
of
a
coarse
and
vulgar
turn
of
mind
may
have
call
it
a
barber
's
;
for
they
not
only
cut
and
curled
lady
elegantly
,
and
child
carefully
,
but
shave
gentleman
easily
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
it
be
a
highly
genteel
establishment
---
quite
first
-
rate
in
fact

and
there
be
display
in
the
window
,
besides
other
elegancie
,
waxen
bust
of
a
light
lady
and
a
dark
gentleman
which
be
the
admiration
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
some
lady
have
go
so
far
as
to
assert
,
that
the
dark
gentleman
be
actually
a
portrait
of
the
spirt
young
proprietor
;
and
the
great
similarity
between
their
head
-
dress
---
both
wear
very
glossy
hair
,
with
a
narrow
walk
straight
down
the
middle
,
and
a
profusion
of
flat
circular
curl
on
both
side
---
encourage
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
the
better
inform
among
the
sex
,
however
,
make
light
of
this
assertion
,
for
however
willing
they
be
(
and
they
be
very
willing
)
to
do
full
justice
to
the
handsome
face
and
figure
of
the
proprietor
,
they
hold
the
countenance
of
the
dark
gentleman
in
the
window
to
be
an
exquisite
and
abstract
idea
of
masculine
beauty
,
realise
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
among
angel
and
military
man
,
but
very
rarely
embody
to
gladden
the
eye
of
mortal

<EOS>
It
be
to
this
establishment
that
Newman
Noggs
lead
Miss

in
safety

the
proprietor

that
Miss

three

each
with
two
flaxen
tail

and
all
good
for
sixpence
apiece
,
once
a
month
at

,
promptly
desert
an
old
gentleman
whom
he
have
just
lather
for
shaving
,
and
hand
him
over
to
the
journeyman
,
(
who
be
not
very
popular
among
the
lady
,
by
reason
of
his
obesity
and
middle
age

wait
on
the
young

just
as
this

the

the
style

which
Newman
attribute
to
Mr

recent
association
with
theatrical
character
---
not

quite
explanatory
,
Newman
look
as
if

be
about

ask
another
question

when
Mr

prevent

shake

<EOS>
"
be

demand
the

<EOS>
"
It
be

"
return
Newman
,
rather
embarrassed
by
the
question

<EOS>
"
Susan

use
to
say
,
"
observe
the

"
that
if
ever

she
hope
it

be
like

<EOS>
be
this
one
like
me
,
Mr
Noggs
?
"
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
puzzling
inquiry
;
but
Newman
evade
it
,
by
reply
to
Mr
Lillyvick
,
that
he
think
the
baby
may
possibly
come
like
him
in
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
glad
to
have
somebody
like

somehow

"
say
Mr

,
"
before
I
die

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
to
do
that
,
yet
awhile

"
say
Newman
.
   
<EOS>
unto
which
Mr
Lillyvick
reply
in
a
solemn
voice
,
"
let
me
be
shave
!
"
and
again
consign
himself
to
the
hand
of
the
journeyman
,
say
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
remarkable
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
so
remarkable
do
it
seem
to
Miss
Morleena
,
that
that
young
lady
,
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
have
her
ear
slice
off
,
have
not
be
able
to
forbear
look
round
,
some
score
of
time
,
during
the
foregoing
colloquy
.
 
<EOS>
of
her
,
however
,
Mr
Lillyvick
take
no
notice
:
rather
strive
(
so
,
at
least
,
it
seem
to
Newman
Noggs
)
to
evade
her
observation
,
and
to
shrink
into
himself
whenever
he
attract
her
regard
.
 
<EOS>
Newman
wonder
very
much
what
could
have
occasion
this
alter
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
collector
;
but
,
philosophically
reflect
that
he
would
most
likely
know
,
sooner
or
later
,
and
that
he
could
perfectly
afford
to
wait
,
he
be
very
little
disturb
by
the
singularity
of
the
old
gentleman
's
deportment
.
   
<EOS>
the
cutting
and
curl
being
at
last
conclude
,
the
old
gentleman
,
who
have
be
some
time
wait
,
rise
to
go
,
and
,
walk
out
with
Newman
and
his
charge
,
take
Newman
's
arm
,
and
proceed
for
some
time
without
make
any
observation
.
 
<EOS>
Newman
,
who
in
power
of
taciturnity
be
excel
by
few
people
,
make
no
attempt
to
break
silence
;
and
so
they
go
on
,
until
they
have
very
nearly
reach
Miss
Morleena
's
home
,
when
Mr
Lillyvick
say
:
   
"

the
kenwigse
very
much
overpower

"
suggest
Newman
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah

<EOS>
"
reply
Mr
Lillyvick
,
with
another
groan
;
this
time
not
even
disguise
by
a
wheeze
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
make
ma
cry
when
she
know
it

"
interpose
Miss

<EOS>
"
Would

the

with
some
hesitation

<EOS>

catch
Miss

up
in

this
time
at

meekly

this
be
touch
the

Mrs

instantly
burst

<EOS>
and
now
when
I
look
at
him
;
a
precious

unconscious

helpless
infant

with
no
use
in
his
little

to
tear
his
little
cap

no

to

I

cooing

Mrs

herself
upon
the

bitterly
reproach
herself
for
her
late
harshness

exclaim
,
if
she
have

what
must
his
suffering
have
be

<EOS>
Mr

grasp
his

eternal

<EOS>
Mrs

stricken

serpent

<EOS>
Mr

argue

she
must
have
be
bad
indeed
not
to
have
improve
by
so
long
a

of
Mrs

<EOS>
Mrs

remember
that
Mr

have
often
say
that
he
be
not
quite
satisfied
of
the
propriety
of
Miss
Petowker
's
conduct
,
and
wonder
how
it
be
that
she
could
have
be
blind
by
such
a
wretch
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Kenwigs
remember
that
he
have
have
his
suspicion
,
but
do
not
wonder
why
Mrs

have
not
have
her

as
she

purity

Henrietta

both
say
,
with
strong
feeling

tear
of

that
everything

conjure
the

consolation
in

the

shed
a

tear

they
get
him
into
the
elbow

prevail
upon
him

order
by
Mr

when
,
with
the

a
situation

he
softly
leave

feel
as
though

be
to
lose
most
precious
time

to
be
up

stirring
be
in

way

promote
the
end
he
have

look

everything
appear

yield
him
some

for
despondency

<EOS>
last
night

the
sacrifice
of
a
young
,
affectionate
,
and
beautiful
creature
,
to
such
a
wretch
,
and
in
such
a
cause
,
have
seem
a
thing
too
monstrous
to
succeed
;
and
the
warm
he
grow
,
the
more
confident
he
feel
that
some
interposition
must
save
her
from
his
clutch
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
when
he
think
how
regularly
thing
go
on
,
from
day
to
day
,
in
the
same
unvarying
round
;
how
youth
and
beauty
die
,
and
ugly
gripe
age
live
totter
on
;
how
crafty
avarice
grow
rich
,
and
manly
honest
heart
be
poor
and
sad
;
how
few
they
be
who
tenant
the
stately
house
,
and
how
many
of
those
who
lie
in
noisome
pen
,

rise
each

lay
them
down
each

live

die

father

son

mother

race
upon
race

generation
upon
generation
,
without
a
home
to
shelter
them
or
the
energy
of
one
single
man
direct
to
their
aid
;
how
,
in
seek
,
not
a
luxurious
and
splendid
life
,
but
the
bare
mean
of
a
most
wretched
and
inadequate
subsistence

there
be
woman

child
in
that
one
town

divide

class

number

regularly

the
noble
family

folk

great
degree

and
rear
from
infancy
to
drive
most
criminal

dreadful
trade

how
ignorance

never

;
how
jail

door
gape
,
and
gallow
loom
,
for
thousand
urge
towards
them
by
circumstance
darkly
curtain
their
very
cradle
'
head
,
and
but
for
which
they
may
have
earn
their
honest
bread
and
live
in
peace
;
how
many
die
in
soul

have
no
chance
of
life

how
many
who
could
scarcely
go
astray
,
be
they
vicious
as
they
would

turn
haughtily
from
the
crushed
and
stricken
wretch

would
have
be
a
great
wonder
<EOS>
have
he
or
she
do
well

than
even
they
have
they
do
ill
;
how
much
injustice

misery
,
and
wrong

there
be
,
and
yet
how
the
world
roll
on
,
from
year
to
year
,
alike
careless
and
indifferent
,
and
no
man
seek
to
remedy
or
redress
it
;
when
he
think
of
all
this
,
and
select
from
the
mass
the
one
slight
case
on
which
his
thought
be
bent
,
he
feel
,
indeed
,
that
there
be
little
ground
for
hope
,
and
little
reason
why
it
should
not
form
an
atom
in
the
huge
aggregate
of
distress
and
sorrow
,
and
add
one
small
and
unimportant
unit
to
swell
the
great
amount
.
   
<EOS>
but
youth
be
not
prone
to
contemplate
the
dark
side
of
a
picture
it
can
shift
at
will

<EOS>
by
dint
of
reflect
on
what
he
have
to
do

and
revive
the
train
of
thought
which
night
have
interrupt
,
Nicholas
gradually
summon
up
his
utmost
energy
,
and
when
the
morning
be
sufficiently
advanced
for
his
purpose
,
have
no
thought
but
that
of
use
it
to
the
good
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
a
hasty
breakfast
take
,
and
such
affair
of
business
as
require
prompt
attention
dispose
of
,
he
direct
his
step
to
the
residence
of
Madeline
Bray
:
whither
<EOS>
he
lose
no
time
in
arrive

<EOS>
It
have
occur
to
him
that
,
very
possibly
,
the
young
lady
may
be
deny
,
although
to
him
she
never
have
be
;
and
he
be
still
ponder
upon
the
sure
method
of
obtain
access
to
her
in
that
case
,
when
,
come
to
the
door
of
the
house
,
he
find
it
have
be
leave
ajar
---
probably
by
the
last
person
who
have
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
the
occasion
be
not
one
upon
which
to
observe
the
nice
ceremony
;
therefore
,
avail
himself
of
this
advantage
,
Nicholas
walk
gently
upstairs
and
knock
at
the
door
of
the
room
into
which
he
have
be
accustom
to
be
show
.
 
<EOS>
receive
permission

enter

person
on

side

in

and
his
daughter
be
sit
there
alone

<EOS>
It
be
nearly
three
week
since
he
have
see
her
last
,
but
there
be
a
change
in
the
lovely
girl
before
him
which
tell
Nicholas
,
in
startling
term
,
how
much
mental
suffering
have
be
compress
into
that
short
time
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
word
which
can
express
,
nothing
with
which
can
be
compare
,
the
perfect
pallor
,
the
clear
transparent
whiteness
,
of
the
beautiful
face
which
turn
towards
him
when
he
enter
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hair
be
a
rich
deep
brown
,
but
shade
that
face
,
and
stray
upon
a
neck
that
rival
it
in
whiteness
<EOS>
,
it
seem
by
the
strong
contrast
raven
black
.
 
<EOS>
something
of
wildness
and
restlessness
there
be
in
the
dark
eye
,
but
there
be
the
same
patient
look
,
the
same
expression
of
gentle
mournfulness
which
he
well
remember
,
and
no
trace
of
a
single
tear
.
 
<EOS>
most
beautiful
---
more
beautiful
,
perhaps
,
than
ever
---
there
be
something
in
her
face
which
quite
unman
him
,
and
appear
far
more
touching
than
the
wildest
agony
of
grief
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
merely
calm
and
composed
,
but
fixed
and
rigid
,
as
though
the
violent
effort
which
have
summon
that
composure
beneath
her
father
's
eye
,
while
it
master
all
other
thought
,
<EOS>
have
prevent
even
the
momentary
expression
they
have
communicate
to
the
feature
from
subside
,
and
have
fasten
it
there
,
as
an
evidence
of
its
triumph
.
   
<EOS>
the
father
sit
opposite
to
her
;
not
look
directly
in
her
face
,
but
glance
at
her
,
as
he
talk
with
a
gay
air
which
ill
disguise
the
anxiety
of
his
thought
.
 
<EOS>
the
drawing
material
be
not
on
their
accustomed
table
,
nor
be
any
of
the
other
token
of
her
usual
occupation
to
be
see

<EOS>
the
little
vase

Nicholas

always
see
fill

fresh
flower

young

through

ORDERS

have
you
any
fresh

"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
understand
the
tone
of
triumph
in
which
this
interrogatory
be
put
;
but
remember
the
necessity
of
support
his
assumed
character
,
produce
a
scrap
of
paper
purporting
to
contain
a
list
of
some
subject
for
drawing
which
his
employer
desire
to
have
execute
;
and
with
which
he
have
prepare
himself
in
case
of
any
such
contingency

<EOS>
"
oh
!
"

Mr

<EOS>
"
these
be

<EOS>
"
since
you
insist
upon
the

yes

reply
Nicholas

<EOS>
"
then
you
may
tell
your
master

Bray

toss
the
paper
back
again

with
an
exulting
smile
,
"
that
my

Miss
Madeline
Bray

condescend
to
employ
herself
no
longer

such
labour
as
these

that
she
be
not

call
,
as
he
suppose
her
to
be
;
that
we
do
not
live
upon
his
money
,
as
he
flatter
himself
we
do
;
that
he
may
give
whatever
he
owe
us

to
the
first
beggar
that
pass
his
shop

add
it
to
his

them

that
he

that
be
my
acknowledgment

important

the

<EOS>
the
allusion

so
convulsed

the
absence

to

Mrs

only
reply

she
durst

she
be
very
stupid

indeed
she
have
no

she
be
,
for
her
own
child
almost
as
much
as
tell
her
so

every

to

she
be

she

to
all
Kate

ensue

HER

it

uplifting

,
Mrs

remain
until
Nicholas

the

when

have
by
this

assert
her
own
importance

become
besides

the
trial
of
one
so
young

beautiful
,
she
not
only
display
the
utmost
zeal
and
solicitude
,
but
take
great
credit
to
herself
for
recommend
the
course
of
procedure
which
her
son
have
adopt
:
frequently
declare
,
with
an
expressive
look

that
it
be
very
fortunate
thing
be
as
they
be
:
and
hint
,
that
but
<EOS>
for
great
encouragement

wisdom
on

they
never

bring
to

pass

<EOS>
not
to
strain
the
question
whether
Mrs

have
or
have
not
any
great
hand
in
bring
matter
about

it
be
unquestionable
that
she
have
strong
ground
for
exultation

<EOS>
the
brother
,
on
their
return
,
bestow
such
commendation
on

for
the
part
he
have
take

evince
so
much
joy
at
the
altered
state
of
event

the
recovery

trial
so
great

danger
so
threatening

more

consider

Mr

Cheeryble
,
indeed

Mrs

positively
assert

have

in

first
transport

surprise

delight
,
"
as
good
as
"
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
without
precisely
explain
what
this
qualification
mean
,
she
subside
,
whenever
she
mention
the
subject
,
into
such
a
mysterious
and
important
state
,
and
have
such
vision
of
wealth
and
dignity
in
perspective
,
that
(
vague
and
clouded
though
they
be
)
<EOS>
she
be
,
at
such
time
,
almost
as
happy
as
if
she
have
really
be
permanently
provide
for
,
on
a
scale
of
great
splendour
.
   
<EOS>
the
sudden
and
terrible
shock
she
have
receive
,
combine
with
the
great
affliction
and
anxiety
of
mind
which
she
have
,
for
a
long
time
,
endure
,
prove
too
much
for
Madeline
's
strength
.
 
<EOS>
recover
from
the
state
of
stupefaction
into
which
the
sudden
death
of
her
father
happily
plunge
her
,
she
only
exchange
that
condition
for
one
of
dangerous
and
active
illness
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
delicate
physical
power
which
have
be
sustain
by
an
unnatural
strain
upon
the
mental
energy
and
a
resolute
determination
not
to
yield
,
at
last
give
way
,
their
degree
of
prostration
be
usually
proportionate
to
the
strength
of
the
effort
which
have
previously
uphold
them
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
be
that
the
illness
which
fall
on
Madeline
be
of
no
slight
or
temporary
nature
,
but
one
which
,
for
a
time
,
threaten
her
reason
,
and
---
scarcely
worse
---
her
life
itself
.
   
<EOS>
who
,
slowly
recover
from
a
disorder
so
severe
and
dangerous
,
could
be
insensible
to
the
unremitting
attention
of
such
a
nurse
as
gentle

tender

on

the
quiet

cheerful

noiseless
discharge

those
thousand
little

on
whom
could
they
make
so
deep
an
impression
as
on
a
young
heart
store
with
every
pure
and
true
affection
that
woman
cherish
;
almost
a
stranger
to
the
endearment
and
devotion
of
its
own
sex
,
save
as
it
learn
them
from
itself
;
and
render
,
by
calamity
and
suffering
,
keenly
susceptible
of
the
sympathy
so
long
unknown
and
so
long
seek
in
vain
?
 
<EOS>
what
wonder
that
day
become
as
year
in
knit
them
together
!
 
<EOS>
what
wonder
,
if
with
every
hour
of
return
health
,
there
come
some
strong
and
sweet
recognition
of
the
praise
<EOS>
which
Kate
,
when
they
recall
old
scene
<EOS>
---
they
seem
old
now
,
and
to
have
be
act
year
ago
---
would
lavish
on
her
brother
!
 
<EOS>
where
would
have
be
the
wonder
,
even
,
if
those
praise
have
find
a
quick
response
in
the
breast
of
Madeline
,
and
if
,
with
the
image
of
Nicholas
so
constantly
recur
in
the
feature
of
his
sister
that
she
could
scarcely
separate
the
two
,
she
have
sometimes
find
it
equally
difficult
to
assign
to
each
the
feeling
they
have
first
inspire
,
and
have
imperceptibly
mingle
with
her
gratitude
to
Nicholas
,
some
of
that
warm
feeling
which
she
have
assign
to
Kate
?
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
Mrs
Nickleby
would
say
,
come
into
the
room
with
an
elaborate
caution
,
calculate
to
discompose
the
nerve
of
an
invalid
rather
more
than
the
entry
of
a
horse
-
soldier
at
full
gallop
;
"
how
do
you
find
yourself
tonight
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
be
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
almost
well
,
mama
,
"
Kate
would
reply
,
lay
down
her
work
,
and
take
Madeline
's
hand
in
hers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Kate
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Nickleby
would
say
,
reprovingly
,
"
do
not
talk
so
loud
"
(
the
worthy
lady
herself
talk
in
a
whisper
that
would
have
make
the
blood
of
the
stout
man
run
cold
in
his
vein
)
.
   
<EOS>
Kate
would
take
this
reproof
very
quietly
,
and
Mrs
Nickleby
,
make
every
board
creak
and
every
thread
rustle
as
she
move
stealthily
about
,
would
add
:
   
"
<EOS>
My
son
Nicholas
have
just
come
home
,
and
I
have
come
,
accord
to
custom
,
my
dear
,
to
know
,
from
your
own
lip
,
exactly
how
you
be
<EOS>
;
for
he
will
not
take
my
account
,
and
never
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
late
than
usual
to
-
night
,
"
perhaps
Madeline
would
reply
.
"
<EOS>
nearly
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
never
see
such
people
in
all
my
life
as
you
be
,
for
time
,
up
here
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Nickleby
would
exclaim
in
great
astonishment
;
"
I
declare
I
never
do
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
idea
that
Nicholas
be
after
his
time
,
not
the
small
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Nickleby
use
to
say
---
your
poor
papa
,
I
be
speak
of
,
Kate
my
dear
---
use
to
say
,
<EOS>
that
appetite
be
the
good
clock
in
the
world
,
but
you
have
no
appetite
,
my
dear
Miss
Bray
<EOS>
,
I
wish
you
have
,
and
upon
my
word
I
really
think
you
ought
to
take
something
that
would
give
you
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
,
but
I
have
hear
that
two
or
three
dozen
native
lobster
give
an
appetite
,
though
that
come
to
the
same
thing
after
all
,
for
I
suppose
you
must
have
an
appetite
before
you
can
take
'em
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
say
lobster
,
I
mean
oyster
,
but
of
course
it
be
all
the
same
,
though
really
how
you
come
to
know
about
Nicholas
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
happen
to
be
just
talk
about
him
,
mama
;
that
be
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
never
seem
to
me
to
be
talk
about
anything
else
,
Kate
,
and
upon
my
word
I
be
quite
surprised
at
your
be
so
very
thoughtless
.
<EOS>
You
can
find
subject
enough
to
talk
about
sometimes
,
and
when
you
know
how
important
it
be
to
keep
up
Miss
Bray
's
spirit
,
and
interest
her
,
and
all
that
,
it
really
be
quite
extraordinary
to
me
what
can
induce
you
to
keep
on
prose
,
prose
,
prose
,
din
,
din
,
din
,
everlastingly
,
upon
the
same
theme
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
a
very
kind
nurse
,
Kate
,
and
a
very
good
one
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
you
mean
very
well
;
but
I
will
say
this
---
that
if
it
be
not
for
me
,
I
really
do
not
know
what
would
become
of
Miss
Bray
's
spirit
,
and
so
I
tell
the
doctor
every
day
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
wonder
how
I
sustain
my
own
,
and
I
be
sure
I
very
often
wonder
myself
how
I
can
contrive
to
keep
up
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
an
exertion
,
but
still
,
when
I
know
how
much
depend
upon
me
in
this
house
,
I
be
oblige
to
make
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
praiseworthy
in
that
,
but
it
be
necessary
,
and
I
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
that
,
Mrs
Nickleby
would
draw
up
a
chair
,
and
for
some
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
run
through
a
great
variety
of
distract
topic
in
the
most
distracting
manner
possible
;
tear
herself
away
,
at
length
,
on
the
plea
that
she
must
now
go
and
amuse
Nicholas
while
he
take
his
supper
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
preliminary
raising
of
his
spirit
with
the
information
that
she
consider
the
patient
decidedly
bad
,
she
would
further
cheer
him
up
by
relate
how
dull
,
listless
,
and
low
-
spirited
Miss
Bray
be
,
because
Kate
foolishly
talk
about
nothing
else
but
him
and
family
matter
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
make
Nicholas
thoroughly
comfortable
with
these
and
other
inspirit
remark
,
she
would
discourse
at
length
on
the
arduous
duty
she
have
perform
that
day
;
and
,
sometimes
,
be
move
to
tear
in
wonder
how
,
if
anything
be
to
happen
to
herself
,
the
family
would
ever
get
on
without
her
.
   
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
when
Nicholas
come
home
at
night
,
he
would
be
accompany
by
Mr
Frank
Cheeryble
,
who
be
commission
by
the
brother
to
inquire
how
Madeline
be
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
on
such
occasion
(
and
they
be
of
very
frequent
occurrence
)
,
Mrs
Nickleby
deem
it
of
particular
importance
that
she
should
have
her
wit
about
her
;
for
,
from
certain
sign
and
token
which
have
attract
her
attention
,
she
shrewdly
suspect
that
Mr
Frank
,
interested
as
his
uncle
be
in
Madeline
,
come
quite
as
much
to
see
Kate
as
to
inquire
after
her
;
the
more
especially
as
the
brother
be
in
constant
communication
with
the
medical
man
,
come
backwards
and
forwards
very
frequently
themselves
,
and
receive
a
full
report
from
Nicholas
every
morning
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
proud
time
for
Mrs
Nickleby
;
never
be
anybody
half
so
discreet
and
sage
as
she
,
or
half
so
mysterious
withal
;
and
never
be
there
such
cunning
generalship
,
and
such
unfathomable
design
,
as
she
bring
to
bear
upon
Mr
Frank
,
with
the
view
of
ascertain
whether
her
suspicion
be
well
found
:
and
if
so
,
of
tantalise
him
into
take
her
into
his
confidence
and
throw
himself
upon
her
merciful
consideration
.
<EOS>
Extensive
be
the
artillery
,
heavy
and
light
,
which
Mrs
Nickleby
bring
into
play
for
the
furtherance
of
these
great
scheme
;
various
and
opposite
the
mean
which
she
employ
to
bring
about
the
end
she
have
in
view
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
time
,
she
be
all
cordiality
and
ease
;
at
another
,
all
stiffness
and
frigidity
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
she
would
seem
to
open
her
whole
heart
to
her
unhappy
victim
;
the
next
time
they
meet
,
she
would
receive
him
with
the
most
distant
and
studious
reserve
,
as
if
a
new
light
have
break
in
upon
her
,
and
,
guess
his
intention
,
she
have
resolve
to
check
them
in
the
bud
;
as
if
she
feel
it
her
bounden
duty
to
act
with
spartan
firmness
,
and
at
once
and
for
ever
to
discourage
hope
which
never
could
be
realise
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
when
Nicholas
be
not
there
to
overhear
,
and
Kate
be
upstairs
busily
tend
her
sick
friend
,
the
worthy
lady
would
throw
out
dark
hint
of
an
intention
to
send
her
daughter
to
France
for
three
or
four
year
,
or
to
Scotland
for
the
improvement
of
her
health
impair
by
her
late
fatigue
,
or
to
America
on
a
visit
,
or
anywhere
that
threaten
a
long
and
tedious
separation
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
she
even
go
so
far
as
to
hint
,
obscurely
,
at
an
attachment
entertain
for
her
daughter
by
the
son
of
an
old
neighbour
of
theirs
,
one
Horatio
Peltirogus
(
a
young
gentleman
who
may
have
be
,
at
that
time
,
four
year
old
,
or
thereabout
)
,
and
to
represent
it
,
indeed
,
as
almost
a
settle
thing
between
the
family
---
only
wait
for
her
daughter
's
final
decision
,
to
come
off
with
the
sanction
of
the
church
,
and
to
the
unspeakable
happiness
and
content
of
all
party
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
full
pride
and
glory
of
have
spring
this
last
mine
one
night
with
extraordinary
success
,
that
Mrs
Nickleby
take
the
opportunity
of
be
leave
alone
with
her
son
before
retire
to
rest
,
to
sound
him
on
the
subject
which
so
occupy
her
thought
:
not
doubt
that
they
could
have
but
one
opinion
respect
it
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
end
,
she
approach
the
question
with
diver
laudatory
and
appropriate
remark
touch
the
general
amiability
of
Mr
Frank
Cheeryble
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

I

do
you

<EOS>
"

well
as
I
remember
,
I
should
call
it
a
kind
of
composite

mixed
nose

but
I
have
no
very
strong
recollection
on
the
subject

<EOS>
if
it

any

I

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
I
do

highly

<EOS>
elate
by
a
look
of
curiosity
from
her
son

the
consciousness
of
possess
a

all
to
herself

Mrs

go
on
with
great
animation

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
my

Nicholas

how
you
can
have
fail
to
notice
it

be
,
to
me
,
quite
extraordinary
;
though
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
say
that

either
,
because
,
of
course
,
as
far
as
it
go
,
and
to
a
certain
extent
,
there
be
a
great
deal
in
this
sort

especially
in
this
early
stage

which
,
however
clear
it
may
be
to
female

can
scarcely

expect
to
be
so
evident

<EOS>
I
do
not

that
I
have
any
particular
penetration

<EOS>
I
may
have
;
those
about
me
should
know
good
about
that

and
perhaps
do
know

<EOS>
upon
that
point
I
shall
express
no
opinion

it
would
not
become
me
to
do
so

it

out

quite

the

put
his

in
his
pocket

lean
back
in

patient
suffering

melancholy
resignation

"
I

it
my
duty

Nicholas

my

resume
his
mother

"
to
tell
you
what
I
know

not
only
because
you
have
a
right
to
know
it
too
,
and
to
know
everything
that
happen
in
this
family

but
because
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
promote
and
assist
the
thing
very
much
;

there
be
no
doubt
that
the
sooner
one
can
come

it
be
always
well

every

<EOS>
there
be
a
great
many
thing
you
may
do
;
such
as
take
a
walk
in
the
garden
sometimes
,

sit
upstairs
in
your
own
room
for
a
little
while

make
believe
to
fall
asleep
occasionally
,
or
pretend
that
you
recollect
some
business
,

go
out
for
an
hour

so
,
and
take
Mr

with
you

<EOS>
these
seem
very
slight

I
dare

you
will

amuse

deal
more
depend
upon
these
little
thing
than
you
would
suppose
possible
.
 
<EOS>
if
your
poor
papa
be
alive
,
he
would
tell
you
how
much
depend
on
the
party

leave
alone

<EOS>
of
course
,
you
be
not
to
go
out
of
the
room
as
if
you
mean
it
and
do
it
on
purpose
,

as
if
it
be
quite
an
accident
,

to
come
back
again
in
the
same
way
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
cough
in
the
passage
before
you
open
the
door

whistle
carelessly
,

hum
a
tune
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
to
let
them
know
you
be
come
,
it
be
always
well
;
because
,
of
course
,
though
it
be
not
only
natural
but
perfectly
correct
and
proper
under
the
circumstance
,
still
it
be
very
confusing
if
you
interrupt
young
people
when
they
be
---
when
they
be
sit
on
the
sofa
,
and
---
and
all
that
sort
of
thing

which
be
very
nonsensical
,
perhaps
,

still
they
will
do
it

<EOS>
the
profound
astonishment
with
which
her
son
regard
her
during
this
long
address
,
gradually
increase
as
it
approach
its
climax
in
no
way
discompose
Mrs
Nickleby
,
but
rather
exalt
her
opinion
of
her
own
cleverness
;
therefore
,
merely
stop
to
remark
,
with
much
complacency
,
that
she
have
fully
expect
him
to
be
surprised
,
she
enter
on
a
vast
quantity
of
circumstantial
evidence
of
a
particularly
incoherent
and
perplexing
kind
;
the
upshot
of
which
be
,
to
establish
,
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
,
that
Mr
Frank
Cheeryble
have
fall
desperately
in

very
good

Mrs

,
with
great
confidence

<EOS>
"
wait

"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
have
never
,
until
that
moment
,
bestow
a
thought
upon
the
remote
possibility
of
such
an
occurrence
as
that
which
be
now
communicate
to
him
;
for
,
besides
that
he
have
be
much
from
home
of
late
and
closely
occupy
with
other
matter
,
his
own
jealous
fear
have
prompt
the
suspicion
that
some
secret
interest
in
Madeline
,
akin
to
that
which
he
feel
himself
,
occasion
those
visit
of
Frank
Cheeryble
which
have
recently
become
so
frequent
.
 
<EOS>
even
now
,
although
he
know
that
the
observation
of
an
anxious
mother
be
much
more
likely
to
be
correct
in
such
a
case
than
his
own
,
and
although
she
remind
him
of
many
little
circumstance
which
,
take
together
,
be
certainly
susceptible
of
the
construction
she
triumphantly
put
upon
them
,
he
be
not
quite
convinced
but
that
they
arise
from
mere
good
-
natured
thoughtless
gallantry
,
which
would
have
dictate
the
same
conduct
towards
any
other
girl
who
be
young
and
pleasing
.
 
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
he
hope
so
,
and
therefore
try
to
believe
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
much
disturb
by
what
you
tell
me
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
after
a
little
reflection
,
"
though
I
yet
hope
you
may
be
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
why
you
should
hope
so
,
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
,
"
I
confess
;
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
I
be
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
of
Kate
?
"
inquire
Nicholas
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
that
,
my
dear
,
"
return
Mrs
Nickleby
,
"
be
just
the
point
upon
which
I
be
not
yet
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
during
this
sickness
,
she
have
be
constantly
at
Madeline
's
bedside
---
never
be
two
people
so
fond
of
each
other
as
they
have
grow
---
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
Nicholas
,
I
have
rather
keep
her
away
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
because
I
think
it
be
a
good
plan
,
and
urge
a
young
man
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
get
too
sure
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
say
this
with
such
a
mingling
of
high
delight
and
self
-
congratulation
,
that
it
be
inexpressibly
painful
to
Nicholas
to
dash
her
hope
;
but
he
feel
that
there
be
only
one
honourable
course
before
him
,
and
that
he
be
bind
to
take
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
dear
mother
,
"
he
say
kindly
,
"
do
not
you
see
that
if
there
be
really
any
serious
inclination
on
the
part
of
Mr
Frank
towards
Kate
,
and
we
suffer
ourselves
for
a
moment
to
encourage
it
,
we
should
be
act
a
most
dishonourable
and
ungrateful
part
?
 
<EOS>
I
ask
you
if
you
do
not
see
it
,
but
I
need
not
say
that
I
know
you
do
not
,
or
you
would
have
be
more
strictly
on
your
guard
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
explain
my
meaning
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
remember
how
poor
we
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Nickleby
shake
her
head
,
and
say
,
through
her
tear
,
that
poverty
be
not
a
crime
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
"
and
for
that
reason
poverty
should
engender
an
honest
pride
,
that
it
may
not
lead
and
tempt
us
to
unworthy
action
,
and
that
we
may
preserve
the
self
-
respect
which
a
hewer
of
wood
and
drawer
of
water
may
maintain
,
and
do
better
in
maintain
than
a
monarch
in
preserve
his
.
 
<EOS>
think
what
we
owe
to
these
two
brother
<EOS>
:
remember
what
they
have
do
,
and
what
they
do
every
day
for
us
with
a
generosity
and
delicacy
for
which
the
devotion
of
our
whole
life
would
be
a
most
imperfect
and
inadequate
return
.
 
<EOS>
what
kind
of
return
would
that
be
which
would
be
comprise
in
our
permit
their
nephew
,
<EOS>
their
only
relative
,
whom
they
regard
as
a
son
,
and
for
whom
it
would
be
mere
childishness
to
suppose
they
have
not
form
plan
suitably
adapt
to
the
education
he
have
have
,
and
the
fortune
he
will
inherit
---
in
our
permit
him
to
marry
a
portionless
girl
:
so
closely
connected
with
us
,
that
the
irresistible
inference
must
be
,
that
he
be
entrap
by
a
plot
;
that
it
be
a
deliberate
scheme
,
and
a
speculation
amongst
us
three
?
<EOS>
bring
the
matter
clearly
before
yourself
,
mother
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
how
would
you
feel
,
if
they
be
married
,
and
<EOS>
the
brother
,
come
here
on
one
of
those
kind
errand
which
bring
them
here
so
often
,
you
have
to
break
out
to
them
the
truth
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
be
at
ease
,
and
feel
that
you
have
play
an
open
part
?
"
   
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs
Nickleby
,
cry
more
and
more
,
murmur
that
of
course
Mr
Frank
would
ask
the
consent
of
his
uncle
first
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
to
be
sure
,
that
would
place
him
in
a
well
situation
with
them
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
"
but
we
should
still
be
open
to
the
same
suspicion
;
the
distance
between
us
would
still
be
as
great
;
the
advantage
to
be
gain
would
still
be
as
manifest
as
now
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
be
reckon
without
our
host
in
all
this
,
"
he
add
more
cheerfully
,
"
and
I
trust
,
and
almost
believe
we
be
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
otherwise
,
I
have
that
confidence
in
Kate
that
I
know
she
will
feel
as
I
do
---
and
in
you
,
dear
mother
,
to
be
assure
that
after
a
little
consideration
you
will
do
the
same
.
"
   
<EOS>
after
many
more
representation
and
entreaty
,
Nicholas
obtain
a
promise
from
Mrs
Nickleby
that
she
would
try
all
she
could
to
think
as
he
do
;
and
that
if
Mr
Frank
persevere
in
his
attention
she
would
endeavour
to
discourage
them
,
or
,
at
the
least
,
would
render
him
no
countenance
or
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
He
determine
to
forbear
mention
the
subject
to
Kate
until
he
be
quite
convinced
that
there
exist
a
real
necessity
for
his
do
so
;
and
resolve
to
assure
himself
,
as
well
as
he
could
by
close
personal
observation
,
of
the
exact
position
of
affair
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
wise
resolution
,
but
he
be
prevent
from
put
it
in
practice
by
a
new
source
of
anxiety
and
uneasiness
.
   
<EOS>
Smike
become
alarmingly
ill
;
so
reduce
and
exhausted
that
he
could
scarcely
move
from
room
to
room
without
assistance
;
and
so
worn
and
emaciate
,
that
it
be
painful
to
look
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
be
warn
,
by
the
same
medical
authority
to
whom
he
have
at
first
appeal
,
that
the
last
chance
and
hope
of
his
life
depend
on
his
be
instantly
remove
from
London

<EOS>
that
part
of
Devonshire
in
which
Nicholas
have
be
himself
breed

name
as
the
most
favourable
spot
;
but
this
advice
be
cautiously
couple
with
the
information
,
that
whoever
accompany
him
thither
must
be
prepare
for
the
bad
;

point

attain
previously
to

when
Ralph

for
some
minute

in
the
attitude

he

his
nephew

breathe
heavily

as
rigid

motionless
in
other
respect

have
be
a
brazen
statue

by
slow
degree

as
a
man

himself
from
heavy
slumber

for
a
moment
he
shake
his
clasped

towards
the
door
by
which
Nicholas

thrust
it
into
his
breast

as
if

repress
by
force

this
show
of

turn
round

hardy

shield
his

there

unnatural
in

with

the
expression

give

every

some
new

frightful
aspect

there
be
something
so
unnatural

ghastly
in
the
contrast

harsh
,
slow
,
steady
voice

only
alter
by
a
certain
halting
of
the
breath
which
make
him
pause
between
almost
every

bent

plainly

these
evidence
of

most
intense

violent
passion

struggle

over

smile
,
Ralph
bid
him
be
silent
,
and
thankful
that
he
be
so
well
off
;
and
then
,
fix
his
eye
steadily
upon
him
,
proceed
to
say
:
   
<EOS>
first
,
that
Nicholas
have
thwart
him
in
a
plan
he
have
form
for
the
disposal
in
marriage
of
a
certain
young
lady
,
and
have
,
in
the
confusion
attendant
on
her
father
's
sudden
death
,
secure
that
lady
himself
,
and
borne
her
off
in
triumph
.
   
<EOS>
secondly
,
that
by
some
will
or
settlement
---
certainly
by
some
instrument
in
writing
,
which
must
contain
the
young
lady
's
name
,
and
could
be
,
therefore
,
easily
select
from
other
,
if
access
to
the
place
where
it
be
deposit
be
once
secure
---
she
be
entitle
to
property
which
,
if
the
existence
of
this
deed
ever
become
known
to
her
,
would
make
her
husband
(
and
Ralph
represent
that
Nicholas
be
certain
to
marry
her
)
a
rich
and
prosperous
man
,
and
most
formidable
enemy
.
   
<EOS>
thirdly
,
that
this
deed
have
be
,
with
other
,
steal
from
one
who
have
himself
obtain
or
conceal
it
fraudulently
,
and
who
fear
to
take
any
step
for
its
recovery
;
and
that
he
(
Ralph
)
know
the
thief
.
   
<EOS>
to
all
this
Mr
Squeers
listen
,
with
greedy
ear
that
devour
every
syllable
,
and
with
his
one
eye
and
his
mouth
wide
open
:
<EOS>
marvel
for
what
special
reason
he
be
honour
with
so
much
of
Ralph
's
confidence
,
and
to
what
it
all
tend
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
Ralph
,
lean
forward
,
and
place
his
hand
on
Squeers
's
arm
,
"
hear
the
design
which
I
have
conceive
,
and
which
I
must
---
I
say
,
<EOS>
must
,
if
I
can
ripen
it
---
have
carry
into
execution
.
<EOS>
no
advantage
can
be
reap
from
this
deed
,
whatever
it
be
,
save
by
the
girl
herself
,
or
her
husband
;
and
the
possession
of
this
deed
by
one
or
other
of
them
be
indispensable
to
any
advantage
be
gain
.
<EOS>
that
<EOS>
I
have
discover
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
that
deed
bring
here
,
that
I
may
give
the
man
who
bring
it
fifty
pound
in
gold
,
and
burn
it
to
ashe
before
his
face
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Squeers
,
after
follow
with
his
eye
the
action
of
Ralph
's
hand
towards
the
fire
-
place
as
if
he
be
at
that
moment
consume
the
paper
,
draw
a
long
breath
,
and
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
who
be
to
bring
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
nobody
,
perhaps
,
for
much
be
to
be
do
before
it
can
be
get
at
,
"
say
Ralph
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
if
anybody
---
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Squeers
's
first
token
of
consternation
,
and
his
flat
relinquishment
of
the
task
,
would
have
stagger
most
man
,
if
they
have
not
immediately
occasion
an
utter
abandonment
of
the
proposition
.
 
<EOS>
on
Ralph
they
produce
not
the
slight
effect
.
<EOS>
resume
,
when
the
schoolmaster
have
quite
talk
himself
out
of
breath
,
as
coolly
as
if
he
have
never
be
interrupt
,
Ralph
proceed
to
expatiate
on
such
feature
of
the
case
as
he
deem
it
most
advisable
to
lay
the
great
stress
on
.
   
<EOS>
these
be
,
the
age
,
decrepitude
,
and
weakness
of
Mrs
Sliderskew
;
the
great
improbability
of
her
have
any
accomplice
or
even
acquaintance
:
take
into
account
her
secluded
habit
,
and
her
long
residence
in
such
a
house
as
Gride
's
;
the
strong
reason
there
be
to
suppose
that
the
robbery
be
not
the
result
of
a
concerted
plan
:
otherwise
she
would
have
watch
an
opportunity
of
carry
off
a
sum
of
money
;
the
difficulty
she
would
be
place
in
when
she
begin
to
think
on
what
she
have
do
,
and
find
herself
encumber
with
document
of
whose
nature
she
be
utterly
ignorant
;
and
the
comparative
ease
with
which
somebody
,
with
a
full
knowledge
of
her
position
,
obtain
access
to
her
,
and
work
on
her
fear
,
if
necessary
,
may
worm
himself
into
her
confidence
and
obtain
,
under
one
pretence
or
another
,
free
possession
of
the
deed
.
 
<EOS>
to
these
be
add
such
consideration
as
the
constant
residence
of
Mr
Squeers
at
a
long
distance
from
London
,
which
render
his
association
with
Mrs
Sliderskew
a
mere
masquerading
frolic
,
in
which
nobody
be
likely
to
recognise
him
,
either
at
the
time
or
afterwards
;
the
impossibility
of
Ralph
's
undertaking
the
task
himself
,
he
be
already
know
to
her
by
sight
;
and
various
comment
on
the
uncommon
tact
and
experience
of
Mr
Squeers
:
which
would
make
his
overreach
one
old
woman
a
mere
matter
of
child
's
play
and
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
in
addition
to
these
influence
and
persuasion
,
Ralph
draw
,
with
his
utmost
skill
and
power
,
a
vivid
picture
of
the
defeat
which
Nicholas
would
sustain
,
should
they
succeed
,
in
link
himself
to
a
beggar
,
where
he
expect
to
we
would
<EOS>
an
heiress
---
glance
at
the
immeasurable
importance
<EOS>
it
must
be
to
a
man
situate
as
Squeers
,
to
preserve
such
a
friend
as
himself
---
dwell
on
a
long
train
of
benefit
,
confer
since
their
first
acquaintance
,
when
he
have
report
favourably
of
his
treatment
of
a
sickly
boy
who
have
die
under
his
hand
(
and
whose
death
be
very
convenient
to
Ralph
and
his
client
,
but
this
he
do
not
say
)
,
and
finally
hint
that
the
fifty
pound
may
be
increase
to
seventy
-
five
,
or
,
in
the
event
of
very
great
success
,
even
to
a
hundred
.
   
<EOS>
these
argument
at
length
conclude
,
Mr
Squeers
cross
his
leg
,
uncross
them
,
scratch
his
head
,
rub
his
eye
,
examine
the
palm
of
his

,
and
bite
his
nail
,
and
after
exhibit
many
other
sign
of
restlessness
and
indecision
,
ask
"
whether
one
hundred
pound
be
the
high
that
Mr
Nickleby
could
go

"
 
<EOS>
be
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
he
become
restless
again
,
and
,
after
some
thought
,
and
an
unsuccessful
inquiry
"
whether
he
could
not
go
another
fifty

"
say
he
suppose
he
must
try

do
the
most
he
could
for
a
friend

which
be
always
his
maxim
,
and
therefore
he
undertake
the
job
.

how

you
to
get
at
the

I

how

go
about

how

with
it
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
dark
,
wet
,
gloomy
night
in
autumn
,
when
in
an
upper
room
of
a
mean
house
situate
in
an
obscure
street
,
or
rather
court
,
near
Lambeth

there

all
alone

one

grotesquely

either
for

for

in
a
loose
greatcoat

with

half
as
long
again

with

without

old
and
greasy

of
which
it

<EOS>
so
attired
,
and
in
a
place
so
far
removed
from
his
usual
haunt
and
occupation
,
and
so
very
poor
and
wretched
in
its
character
,
perhaps
Mrs
Squeers
herself
would
have
have
some
difficulty
in
recognise
her
lord
:
quicken
though
her
natural
sagacity
doubtless
would
have
be
by
the
affectionate
yearning
and
impulse
of
a
tender
wife

<EOS>
but
Mrs

lord
it
be
;
and
in
a
tolerably
disconsolate
mood
Mrs

appear
to

as

himself
from

black

present
no

dull
glimmering
of
poor

the
pattering
of
the
rain

and
occasionally
the
heavy
closing

creaking

Mr

continue
to

disconsolately
about

to
listen
to
these

in
profound
silence

break
only
by
the
rustling
of

<EOS>
Mrs

do
not

"

what
it

the

it

be
that

Philosophy
's
the

say
I

gravely

"
why

<EOS>
naturally
,
the

go
away

equally

here
they
take
up
their
rest
.
   
<EOS>
at
first
,
Smike
be
strong
enough
to
walk
about
,
for
short
distance
at
a
time
,
with
no
other
support
or
aid
than
that
which
Nicholas
could
afford
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
time
,
nothing
appear
to
interest
him
so
much
as
visit
those
place
which
have
be
most
familiar
to
his
friend
in
bygone
day
.
 
<EOS>
yield
to
this
fancy
,
and
please
to
find
that
its
indulgence
beguile
the
sick
boy
of
many
tedious
hour
,
and
never
fail
to
afford
him
matter
for
thought
and
conversation
afterwards
<EOS>
,
Nicholas
make
such
spot
the
scene
of
their
daily
ramble
:
drive
him
from
place
to
place
in
a
little
pony
-
chair
,
and
support
him
on
his
arm
while
they
walk
slowly
among
these
old
haunt
,
or
linger
in
the
sunlight
to
take
long
parting
look
of
those
which
be
most
quiet
and
beautiful
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
on
such
occasion
as
these
,
that
Nicholas
,
yield
almost
unconsciously
to
the
interest
of
old
association
,
would
point
out
some
tree
that
he
have
climb
,
a
hundred
time
,
to
peep
at
the
young
bird
in
their
nest
;
and
the
branch
from
which
he
use
to
shout
to
little
Kate
,
who
stand
below
terrified
at
the
height
he
have
gain
,
and
yet
urge
him
higher
still
by
the
intensity
of
her
admiration
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
old
house
too
,
which
they
would
pass
every
day
,
look
up
at
the
tiny
window
through
which
the
sun
use
to
stream
in
and
wake
him
on
the
summer
morning
---
they
be
all
summer
morning
then
---
and
climb
up
the
garden
-
wall
and
look
over
,
Nicholas
could
see
the
very
rose
-
bush
which
have
come
,
a
present
to
Kate
,
from
some
little
lover
,
and
she
have
plant
with
her
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
hedgerow
where
the
brother
and
sister
have
so
often
gather
wild
flower
together
,
and
the
green
field
and
shady
path
where
they
have
so
often
stray
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
lane
,
or
brook
,
or
copse
,
or
cottage
near
,
with
which
some
childish
event
be
not
entwine
,
and
back
it
come
upon
the
mind
---
as
event
of
childhood
do
---
<EOS>
nothing
in
itself
:
perhaps
a
word
,
a
laugh
,
a
look
,
some
slight
distress
,
a
pass
thought
or
fear
:
and
yet
more
strongly
and
distinctly
mark
,
and
better
remember
,
than
the
hard
trial
or
severest
sorrow
of
a
year
ago
.
   
<EOS>
one
of
these
expedition
lead
them
through
the
churchyard
where
be
his
father
's
grave
.
 
<EOS>
"
even
here
,
"
say
Nicholas
softly
,
"
we
use
to
loiter
before
we
know
what
death
be
,
and
when
we
little
think
whose
ashe
would
rest
beneath
;
and
,
wonder
at
the
silence
,
sit
down
to
rest
and
speak
below
our
breath
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
Kate
be
lose
,
and
after
an
hour
of
fruitless
search
,
they
find
her
,
fast
asleep
,
under
that
tree
which
shade
my
father
's
grave
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
fond
of
her
,
and
say
when
he
take
her
up
in
his
arm
,
still
sleep
,
that
whenever
he
die
he
would
wish
to
be
bury
where
his
dear
little
child
have
lay
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
his
wish
be
not
forget
.
"
   
<EOS>
nothing
more
pass
at
the
time
,
but
that
night
,
as
Nicholas
sit
beside
his
bed
,
Smike
start
from
what
have
seem
to
be
a
slumber
,
and
lay
his
hand
in
his
,
pray
,
as
the
tear
course
down
his
face
,
that
he
would
make
him
one
solemn
promise
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
say
Nicholas
,
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
can
redeem
it
,
or
hope
to
do
so
,
you
know
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
will
,
"
be
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
promise
me
that
when
I
die
,
I
shall
be
bury
near
---
as
near
as
they
can
make
my
grave
---
to
the
tree
we
see
today
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
give
the
promise
;
he
have
few
word
to
give
it
in
,
but
they
be
solemn
and
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
His
poor
friend
keep
his
hand
in
his
,
and
turn
as
if
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
stifle
sobs
;
and
the
hand
be
press
more
than
once
,
or
twice
,
or
thrice
,
before
he
sink
to
rest
,
and
slowly
loose
his
hold
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
fortnight
's
time
,
he
become
too
ill
to
move
about
.
 
<EOS>
once
or
twice
,
Nicholas
drive
him
out
,
prop
up
with
pillow
;
but
the
motion
of
the
chaise
be
painful
to
him
,
and
bring
on
fit
of
fainting
,
which
,
in
his
weakened
state
,
be
dangerous
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
couch
in
the
house
,
which
be
his
favourite
resting
-
place
by
day
;
and
when
the
sun
shine
,
and
the
weather
be
warm
,
Nicholas
have
this
wheel
into
a
little
orchard
which
be
close
at
hand
,
and
his
charge
be
well
wrap
up
and
carry
out
to
it
<EOS>
,
they
use
to
sit
there
sometimes
for
hour
together
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
on
one
of
these
occasion
that
a
circumstance
take
place
,
which
Nicholas
,
at
the
time
,
thoroughly
believe
to
be
the
mere
delusion
of
an
imagination
affect
by
disease
;
but
which
he
have
,
afterwards
,
<EOS>
too
good
reason
to
know
be
of
real
and
actual
occurrence
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
bring
Smike
out
in
his
arm
---
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
a
child
may
have
carry
him
then
---
to
see
the
sunset
,
and
,
have
arrange
his
couch
,
have
take
his
seat
beside
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
watch
the
whole
of
the
night
before
,
and
be
greatly
fatigue
both
in
mind
and
body
,
gradually
fall
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
close
his
eye
five
minute
,
when
he
be
awaken
by
a
scream
,
and
start
up
in
that
kind
of
terror
which
affect
a
person
suddenly
rouse
,
see
,
to
his
great
astonishment
,
that
his
charge
have
struggle
into
a
sit
posture
,
and
with
eye
almost
start
from
their
socket
,
cold
dew
stand
on
his
forehead
,
and
in
a
fit
of
tremble
which
quite
convulse
his
frame
,
be
call
to
him
for
help
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
,
what
be
this
?
"
say
Nicholas
,
bend
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
calm
;
you
have
be
dream

"
   
<EOS>
"
no

no

no

cry
Smike

cling

"
hold
me
tight

<EOS>
do
not

me
go

there

behind
the
tree

"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
follow
his
eye
,
which
be
direct
to
some
distance
behind
the
chair
from
which
he
himself
have
just
rise
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
there
be
nothing
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
nothing
but
your
fancy
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
strove
to
compose
him
;
"
nothing
else
,
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
as
plain
as
I
see
now
,

be
the
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
say
you
will
keep
me
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
swear
you
will
not
leave
me
for
an

!
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
I
ever
leave
you
?
"
return
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
lie
down
again
---
there
!
<EOS>
You
see
I
be
here
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
tell
me
;
what
be
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
remember
,
"
say
Smike
,
in
a
low
voice
,
and
glance
fearfully
round
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
remember
my
tell
you
of
the
man
who
first
take
me
to
the
school
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
surely
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
raise
my
eye
,
just
now
,
towards
that
tree
---
that
one
with
the
thick
trunk
---
and
there
,
with
his
eye
fix
on
me
,
he
stand
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
only
reflect
for
one
moment
,
"
say
Nicholas
;
"
grant
,
for
an
instant
,
that
it
be
likely
he
be
alive
and
wander
about
a
lonely
place
like
this
,
so
far
remove
from
the
public
road
,
do
you
think
that
at
this
distance
of
time
you
could
possibly
know
that
man
again
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
anywhere
---
in
any
dress
,
"
return
Smike
;
"
but
,
just
now
,
he
stand
lean
upon
his
stick
and
look
at
me
,
exactly
as
I
tell
you
I
remember
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
dusty
with
walking
,
and
poorly
dressed
<EOS>
---
I
think
his
clothe
be
ragged
---
but
directly
I
see
him
,
the
wet
night
,
his
face
when
he
leave
me
,
the
parlour
I
be
leave
in
,
and
the
people
that
be
there
,
all
seem
to
come
back
together
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
know
I
see
him
,
he
look
frightened
;
for
he
start
,
and
shrink
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
think
of
him
by
day
,
and
dreamt
of
him
by
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
in
my
sleep
,
when
I
be
quite
a
little
child
,
and
have
look
in
my
sleep
ever
since
,
as
he
do
just
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
endeavour
,
by
every
persuasion
and
argument
he
could
think
of
,
to
convince
the
terrified
creature
that
his
imagination
have
deceive
him
,
and
that
this
close
resemblance
between
the
creation
of
his
dream
and
the
man
he
suppose
he
have
see
be
but
a
proof
of
it
;
but
all
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
could
persuade
him
to
remain
,
for
a
few
moment
,
in
the
care
of
the
people
to
whom
the
house
belong
,
he
institute
a
strict
inquiry
whether
any
stranger
have
be
see
,
and
search
himself
behind
the
tree
,
and
through
the
orchard
,
and
upon
the
land
immediately
adjoin
,
and
in
every
place
near
,
where
it
be
possible
for
a
man
to
lie
conceal
;
but
all
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
satisfied
that
he
be
right
in
his
original
conjecture
,
he
apply
himself
to
calm
the
fear
of
Smike
,
which
,
after
some
time
,
he
partially
succeed
in
do
,
though
not
in
remove
the
impression
upon
his
mind
;
for
he
still
declare
,
again
and
again
,
in
the
most
solemn
and
fervid
manner
,
that
he
have
positively
see
what
he
have
describe
,
and
that
nothing
could
ever
remove
his
conviction
of
its
reality
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
,
Nicholas
begin
to
see
that
hope
be
go
,
and
that
,
upon
the
partner
of
his
poverty
,
and
the
sharer
of
his
well
fortune
,
the
world
be
close
fast
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
little
pain
,
little
uneasiness
,
but
there
be
no
rallying
,
no
effort
,
no
struggle
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
wear
and
waste
to
the
last
degree
;
his
voice
have
sink
so
low
,
that
he
could
scarce
be
hear
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Nature
be
thoroughly
exhausted
,
and
he
have
lain
him
down
to
die
.
   
<EOS>
on
a
fine
,
mild
autumn
day
,
when
all
be
tranquil
and
at
peace
:
when
the
soft
sweet
air
creep
in
at
the
open
window
of
the
quiet
room
,
and
not
a
sound
be
hear
but
the
gentle
rustling
of
the
leave
:
Nicholas
sit
in
his
old
place
by
the
bedside
,
and
know
that
the
time
be
nearly
come
.
 
<EOS>
so
very
still
it
be
,
that
,
every
now
and
then
,
he
bend
down
his
ear
to
listen
for
the
breathing
of
him
who
lie
asleep
,
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
life
be
still
there
,
and
that
he
have
not
fall
into
that
deep
slumber
from
which
on
earth
there
be
no
waking
.
   
<EOS>
while
he
be
thus
employ
,
the
close
eye
open
,
and
on
the
pale
face
there
come
a
placid
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
well
!
"
say
Nicholas
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
sleep
have
do
you
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
such
pleasant
dream
,

be
the
answer

<EOS>
"
such
pleasant
,
happy
dream
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
of
what
?
"
say
Nicholas
.
   
<EOS>
the
die
boy
turn
towards
him
,
and
,
put
his
arm
about
his
neck
,
make
answer
,
"
I
shall
soon
be
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
after
a
short
silence
,
he
speak
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
afraid
to
die
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
contented
.
 
<EOS>
I
almost
think
that
if
I
could
rise
from
this
bed
quite
well
I
would
not
wish
to
do
so
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
so
often
tell
me
we
shall
meet
again
---
so
very
often
lately
,
and
now
I
feel
the
truth
of
that
so
strongly
---
that
I
can
even
bear
to
part
from
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
tremble
voice
and
tearful
eye
,
and
the
close
grasp
of
the
arm
which
accompany
these
latter
word
,
show
how
they
fill
the
speaker
's
heart
;
nor
be
there
want
indication
of
how
deeply
they
have
touch
the
heart
of
him
to
whom
they

"
You

well

"
return
Nicholas
at
length
,
"
and
comfort
me
very
much

dear
fellow

me
hear
you

you
be
happy

if
you
can

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
tell
you
something

first

I
should
not

a

from
you

will

the

for

He

of
her
hair
,
which
hang
at
his
breast
,
fold
in
one

two
slight

<EOS>
He
pray
that

when

dead

Nicholas
would
take
it
off

so
that
no

about
to

earth
,
he
would
hang
it
round
his
neck
again
,
that
it
may
rest
with
him
in
the
grave

<EOS>
upon
his
knee
Nicholas
give
him
this
pledge
,

promise
again
that
he
should
rest

out

They
embrace

kiss
each

"
now

murmur
,
"
I

happy

He
fall
into
a
light
slumber
,

as
before
;
then
,
speak
of
beautiful
garden

stretch
out

fill
with
figure

Ralph

alone

in

solitary
room
where

to
take
his

to
sit
of
night
when
no

him
abroad

be
an
untasted
breakfast

It
be
long
past
the
time
at
which
,
for
many
year
,
he
have
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
go
with
measured
step
downstairs
to
the
business
of
the
day
,
but
he
take
as
little
heed
of
its
monotonous
warning
,
as
of
the
meat
and
drink
before
him
,
and
remain
with
his

rest
on

his

fix
moodily
on

,
in

so
regular
and
unvarye
in
all
that
appertain
to

daily
pursuit
of

would
almost
of

mental

of

to
affect

man
like
him
<EOS>
,
be
sufficiently

by
his
haggard
face
,
jade
air
,
and
hollow
languid
eye
:
which
he
raise
at
last
with
a
start
and
a
hasty
glance
around
him
,
as
one
who
suddenly
awake
from

he
enter
Newman

confront
Mr

of
all
man
alive

this
be
one
of
the
last
he
would
have
wish
to
meet
at

but
,
now
that
he
recognise
in
him
only
the
patron

protector
of
Nicholas

he
would
rather
have
see
a
spectre

one
beneficial
effect

however
,
the
encounter
have
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
instantly
rouse
all
his
dormant
energy
;
rekindle
in
his
breast
the
passion
that
,
for
many
year
,
have
find
an
improve
home
there
;
call
up
all
his
wrath
,
hatred
,
and
malice
;
restore
the
sneer
to
his
lip
,
and
the
scowl
to
his
brow
;
and
make
him
again
,
in
all
outward
appearance
,
the
same
Ralph
Nickleby
whom
so
many
have
bitter
cause
to
remember
.

"
Humph
!

You

<EOS>
"
plainly

interrupt

I
wish
this
conference
to
be
a
short
one
,

to
end
where
it
begin
.
 
<EOS>
I
guess
the
subject
upon
which
you
be
about
to
speak

I
will
not
hear
you

You
like
plainness

there
it

Our
way
lie
in
very
different
direction

take
yours

I
beg
of
you

me
to
pursue
mine
in
quiet

repeat
brother

mildly

look
at

more
of
pity

reproach

"
to
pursue
his
way
in
quiet
!

<EOS>
"
You
will
scarcely
remain
in
my
house
,
I
presume
,
sir
,
against
my
will
,
"
say
Ralph
;
"
or
you
can
scarcely
hope
to
make
an
impression
upon
a
man
who
close
his
ear
to
all
that
you
can
say
,
and
be
firmly
and
resolutely
determined
not
to
hear
you

<EOS>
"
Mr
Nickleby
,
sir
,
"
return
brother
Charles
:
no
less
mildly
than
before
,
but
firmly
too
:
<EOS>
"
I
come
here
against
my
will
,
sorely
and
grievously
against
my
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
be
in
this
house
before
;
and
,
to
speak
my
mind
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
do
not
feel
at
home
or
easy
in
it
,
and
have
no
wish
ever
to
be
here
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
guess
the
subject
on
which
I
come
to
speak
to
you
;
you
do
not
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
of
that
,
or
your
manner
would
be
a
very
different
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ralph
glance
keenly
at
him
,
but
the
clear
eye
and
open
countenance
of
the
honest
old
merchant
undergo
no
change
of
expression
,
and
meet
his
look
without
reserve
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
on
?
"
say
Mr
Cheeryble
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

all

drily

here
be

most
attentive

certain
not

you

<EOS>
go
on

I
beg
;
make
my
house
your

perhaps
by
the
time
I
return
from
my
walk

you
will
have
finish
what
you
have
to
say
,

will
yield
me
up
possession
again

<EOS>
so
say
,
he
button
his
coat
,

turn
into
the
passage
,
take
down
his
hat

<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
follow

be
about
to
speak

when
Ralph
wave
him
off
impatiently

:

not

return
brother
Charles

shake
his

an
err

ask
none

no

with
these
word

utter
with
great
emphasis

emotion

brother
Charles
put
on
his
broad

Ralph

nimbly
into

Ralph
look
after

some
time

break
what
almost

silence

scornful
laugh

<EOS>
for
an
instant
Ralph
have
his
hand
raise
,
as
though
he
be
about
to
strike
her
;

,
check
himself
,
and
nod
his
head

muttering
as
though
to
assure
her
he
would
not
forget
this
,
walk
away
.
   
<EOS>
Thence
,
he
go
straight
to
the
inn
which
Mr
Squeers
frequent
,
and
inquire
when
he
have
be
there
last
;
in
the
vague
hope
that
,
successful
or
unsuccessful
,
he
may
,
by
this
time
,
have
return
from
his
mission
and
be
able
to
assure
him
that
all
be
safe
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
Squeers
have
not
be
there
for
ten
day
,
and
all
that
the
people
could
tell
about
him
be
,
that
he
have
leave
his
luggage
and
his
bill
.
   
<EOS>
disturb
by
a
thousand
fear
and
surmise
,
and
bent
upon
ascertain
whether
Squeers
have
any
suspicion
of
Snawley
,
or
be
,
in
any
way
,
a
party
to
this
alter
behaviour
,
Ralph
determine
to
hazard
the
extreme
step
of
inquire
for
him
at
the
Lambeth
lodging
,
and
have
an
interview
with
him
even
there
.
 
<EOS>
bent
upon
this
purpose
,
and
in
that
mood
in
which
delay
be
insupportable
,
he
repair
at
once
to
the
place
;
and
be
,
by
description
,
perfectly
acquaint
with
the
situation
of
his
room
,
creep
upstairs
and
knock
gently
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
not
one
,
nor
two
,
nor
three
,
nor
yet
a
dozen
knock
,
serve
to
convince
Ralph
,
against
his
wish
,
that
there
be
nobody
inside
.
 
<EOS>
He
reason
that
he
may
be
asleep
;
and
,
listening
,
almost
persuade
himself
that
he
could
hear
him
breathe
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
he
be
satisfied
that
he
could
not
be
there
,
he
sit
patiently
on
a
broken
stair
and
wait
;
argue
,
that
he
have
go
out
upon
some
slight
errand
,
and
must
soon
return
.
   
<EOS>
many
foot
come
up
the
creaking
stair
;
and
the
step
of
some
seem
to
his
listening
ear
so
like
that
of
the
man
for
whom
he
wait
,
that
Ralph
often
stand
up
to
be
ready
to
address
him
when
he
reach
the
top
;
but
,
one
by
one
,
each
person
turn
off
into
some
room
short
of
the
place
where
he
be
station
:
and
at
every
such
disappointment
he
feel
quite
chill
and
lonely
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
he
feel
it
be
hopeless
to
remain
,
and
go
downstairs
again
,
inquire
of
one
of
the
lodger
if
he
know
anything
of
Mr
Squeers
's
movement
---
mention
that
worthy
by
an
assumed
name
which
have
be
agree
upon
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
lodger
he
be
refer
to
another
,
and
by
him
to
someone
else
,
from
whom
he
learn
,
that
,
late
on
the
previous
night
,
he
have
go
out
hastily
with
two
man
,
who
have
shortly
afterwards
return
for
the
old
woman
who
live
on
the
same
floor
;
and
that
,
although
the
circumstance
have
attract
the
attention
of
the
informant
,
he
have
not
speak
to
them
at
the
time
,
nor
make
any
inquiry
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
this
possess
him
with
the
idea
that
,
perhaps
,
Peg
Sliderskew
have
be
apprehend
for
the
robbery
,
and
that
Mr
Squeers
,
be
with
her
at
the
time
,
have
be
apprehend
also
,
on
suspicion
of
be
a
confederate
.
 
<EOS>
if
this
be
so
,
the
fact
must
be
know
to
Gride
;
and
to
Gride
's
house
he
direct
his
step
;
now
thoroughly
alarm
,
and
fearful
that
there
be
indeed
plot
afoot
,
tend
to
his
discomfiture
and
ruin
.
   
<EOS>
arrive
at
the
usurer
's
house
,
he
find
the
window
close
shut
,
the
dingy
blind
draw
down
;
all
be
silent
,
melancholy
,
and
desert
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
its
usual
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
He
knock
---
gently
at
first
---
then
loud
and
vigorously
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
come
.

so
cautiously
that
no

of
the
old

body

<EOS>
the
sharp
feature
and
white
hair
appear
alone

above

inflexibility

go
on
to
say
,
that
to
show
him
how
much
they

it

Tim
Linkinwater

Newman
Noggs
,
all
three
at
once
;
who
,
after
a
vast
deal
of
talk
together
,
and
a
scene
of
great
confusion
,
lay
before
Ralph
,
in
distinct
term
,
the
follow
statement
.
   
<EOS>
that
,
Newman
,
have
be
solemnly
assure
by
one
not
then
producible
that
Smike
be
not
the
son
of
Snawley
,
and
this
person
have
offer
to
make
oath
to
that
effect
,
if
necessary
,
they
have
by
this
communication
be
first
lead
to
doubt
the
claim
set
up
,
which
they
would
otherwise
have
see
no
reason
to
dispute
,
support
as
it
be
by
evidence
which
they
have
no
power
of
disproving
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
once
suspect
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
,
they
have
no
difficulty
in
trace
back
its
origin
to
the
malice
of
Ralph
,
and
the
vindictiveness
and
avarice
of
Squeers
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
suspicion
and
proof
be
two
very
different
thing
,
they
have
be
advise
by
a
lawyer
,
eminent
for
his
sagacity
and
acuteness
in
such
practice
,
to
resist
the
proceeding
take
on
the
other
side
for
the
recovery
of
the
youth
as
slowly
and
artfully
as
possible
,
and
meanwhile
to
beset
Snawley
(
with
whom
it
be
clear
the
main
falsehood
must
rest
)
;
to
lead
him
,
if
possible
,
into
contradictory
and
conflicting
statement
;
to
harass
him
by
all
available
mean
;
and
so
to
practise
on
his
fear
,
and
regard
for
his
own
safety
,
as
to
induce
him
to
divulge
the
whole
scheme
,
and
to
give
up
his
employer
and
whomsoever
else
he
could
implicate
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
all
this
have
be
skilfully
do
;
but
that
Snawley
,
who
be
well
practise
in
the
art
of
low
cunning
and
intrigue
,
have
successfully
baffle
all
their
attempt
,
until
an
unexpected
circumstance
have
bring
him
,
last
night
,
upon
his
knee

<EOS>
It
thus
arise
.
 
<EOS>
when
Newman
Noggs
report
that
Squeers
be
again
in
town
,
and
that
an
interview
of
such
secrecy
have
take
place
between
him
and
Ralph
that
he
have
be
send
out
of
the
house

plainly
lest

should
overhear
a
word
,
a
watch
be
set
upon
the
schoolmaster
,
in
the
hope
that
something
may
be
discover
which
would
throw
some
light
upon
the
suspect
plot
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
find
,
however
,
that
he
hold
no
further
communication
with
Ralph
,
nor
any
with
Snawley
,
and
live
quite
alone
,
they
be
completely
at
fault
;
the
watch
be
withdraw
,
and
they
would
have
observe
his
motion
no
longer
,
if
it
have
not
happen
that
,
one
night
,
Newman
stumble
unobserved
on
him
and
Ralph
in
the
street
together
.
 
<EOS>
follow
them
,
he
discover
,
to
his
surprise
,
that
they
repair
to
various
low
lodging
-
house
,
and
tavern
keep
by
broken
gambler
,
to
more
than
one
of
whom
Ralph
be
know
,
and
that
they
be
in
pursuit
<EOS>
---
so
he
find
by
inquiry
when
they
have
leave
---
of
an
old
woman
,
whose
description
exactly
tally
with
that
of
deaf
Mrs
Sliderskew
.
 
<EOS>
Affairs
now
appear
to
assume
a
more
serious
complexion
,
the
watch
be
renew
with
increase
vigilance
;
an
officer
be
procure
,
who
take
up
his
abode
in
the
same
tavern
with
Squeers
:
and
by
him
and
Frank
Cheeryble
the
footstep
of
the
unconscious
schoolmaster
be
dog
,
until
he
be
safely
house
in
the
lodging
at
Lambeth
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Squeers
have
shift
his
lodging
,
the
officer
shift
his
,
and
lie
conceal
in
the
same
street
,
and
,
indeed
,
in
the
opposite
house
,
soon
find
that
Mr
Squeers
and
Mrs
Sliderskew
be
in
constant
communication
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
thing
,
Arthur
Gride
be
appeal
to
.
 
<EOS>
the
robbery
,
partly
owing
to
the
inquisitiveness
of
the
neighbour
,
and
partly
to
his
own
grief
and
rage
,
have
,
long
ago
,
become
known
;
but
he
positively
refuse
to
give
his
sanction
or
yield
any
assistance
to
the
old
woman
's
capture
,
and
be
seize
with
such
a
panic
at
the
idea
of
be
call
upon
to
give
evidence
against
her
,
that
he
shut
himself
up
close
in
his
house
,
and
refuse
to
hold
communication
with
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
pursuer
take
counsel
together
,
and
,
come
so
near
the
truth
as
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
Gride
and
Ralph
,
with
Squeers
for
their
instrument
,
be
negotiate
for
the
recovery
of
some
of
the
steal
paper
which
would
not
bear
the
light
,
and
may
possibly
explain
the
hint
relative
to
Madeline
which
Newman
have
overhear
,
resolve
that
Mrs
Sliderskew
should
be
take
into
custody
before
she
have
part
with
them
:
and
Squeers
too
,
if
anything
suspicious
could
be
attach
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
a
search
-
warrant
being
procure
,
and
all
prepared
,
Mr
Squeers
's
window
be
watch
,
until
his
light
be
put
out
,
and
the
time
arrive
when
,
as
have
be
previously
ascertain
,
he
usually
visit
Mrs
Sliderskew
.
 
<EOS>
this
do
,
Frank
Cheeryble

Newman
steal
upstairs
to
listen

It

stare
ruefully
at

his

find
a
vent
in

pithy
sentence
:

His

have
afford
Ralph
an
opportunity

recover
his
presence

which
at

suggest
to
him
the
necessity
of
removing

as
far
as
possible
,
the

misgiving

lead
him
to
believe
that
his

send

which

then
,
he
sit
down
by
the
light
of
a
single
candle
,
and
begin
to
think
,
for
the
first
time

on
all
that

that
day

<EOS>
He
have
neither

undergo

have
be
travel
about

from

place
almost
incessantly

for
many
hour

He
feel
sick

exhausted

could
taste
nothing
save
a
glass
of
water
,
and
continue
to
sit
with
his
head
upon
his
hand
;
not
rest
nor
think
,

laboriously
try
to
do
both
,

feel
that
every
sense

one
of
weariness
and
desolation
,
be
for
the
time

<EOS>
It
be
nearly
ten
o'clock
when
he
hear
a
knocking
at
the
door
,
and
still
sit
quiet
as
before
,
as
if
he
could
not
even
bring
his
thought
to
bear
upon
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
often

several
time
,
hear

a
light
in

window

(
meaning

very
dreadful

Ralph
look
at
him
more
closely
.

see
that
he
be
indeed
greatly
excited
,
he
falter
,
and
could
not
tell
what
to
say
or
think
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
hear
this
now

than
at

it
may
have
some
influence
with
you

Heaven

<EOS>
perhaps
,
at
,
another
time
,
Ralph
's
obstinacy
and
dislike
would
have
be
proof
against
any
appeal
from
such
a
quarter
,
however
emphatically
urge
;
but
now
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
he
go
into
the
hall
for
his
hat
,
and
return
,
get
into
the
coach
without
speak
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
Tim
well
remember
afterwards
,
and
often
say
,
that
as
Ralph
Nickleby
go
into
the
house
for
this
purpose
,
he
see
him
,
by
the
light
of
the
candle
which
he
have
set
down
upon
a
chair
,
reel
and
stagger
like
a
drunken
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
well
remember
,
too
,
that
when
he
have
place
his
foot
upon
the
coach
-
step
,
he
turn
round
and
look
upon
him
with
a
face
so
ashy
pale
and
so
very
wild
and
vacant
that
it
make
him
shudder
,
and
for
the
moment
almost
afraid
to
follow
.
<EOS>
People
be
fond
of
say
that
he
have
some
dark
presentiment
upon
him
then
,
but
his
emotion
may
,
perhaps
,
with
great
show
of
reason
,
be
refer
to
what
he
have
undergo
that
day
.
   
<EOS>
a
profound
silence

during
the
ride

<EOS>
arrive
at
their
place
of
destination
,
Ralph
follow
his
conductor
into
the
house
,
and
into
a
room
where
the
two
brother
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
astounded
,
not
to
say
awed
,
by
something
of
a
mute
compassion
for
himself
which
be
visible
in
their
manner
and
in
that
of
the
old
clerk
,
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
.
   
<EOS>
have
take
a
seat
,
however
,
he
contrive
to
say
,
though
in
broken
word
,
"
what
---
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
---
more
than

already

"
   
<EOS>
the
room
be
old
and
large
,
very
imperfectly
light
,
and
terminate
in
a
bay
window
,
about
which
hang
some
heavy
drapery
.
 
<EOS>
cast
his
eye
in
this
direction
as
he
speak
,
he
think
he
make
out
the
dusky
figure
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
confirm
in
this
impression
by
see
that
the
object
move
,
as
if
uneasy
under
his
scrutiny

"

<EOS>
in
turn
his
face
towards
the
brother
he
be

to
avert
it
from
the
window
;
but
,
before
either
of
them
could
speak
,
he
have
look
round
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
he
be
render
restless
and
uncomfortable
by
the
presence
of
the
unseen
person
;
for
he
repeat
this
action
several
time

at
length

as

so

as
an
excuse

apart
for
a
short
time

that
they
be

Ralph
glance
at
them
twice
or
thrice

and
ultimately

,
with
a
great
effort
to
recover
his
self

possession
,
"

upon
a

Brother
Charles

,
and

He
stop
,
as
if
to
recollect

and
look
away
from
Ralph

address
himself
to
the
brother

proceed
in
a
subdued
and
humble
tone
:
   
"
<EOS>
among
those
who
once
have
dealing
with
this
man
,
gentleman
---
that
be
from
twenty
to
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
ago
---
there
be
one
:
a
rough
fox
-
hunting
,
hard
-
drink
gentleman
,
who
have
run
through
his
own
fortune
,
and
want
to
squander
away
that
of
his
sister
:
they
be
both
orphan
,
and
she
live
with
him
and
manage
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
,
originally
,
to
back
his
influence
and
try
to
over
-
persuade
the
young
woman
or
not
,
but
he
,
"
point
,
to
Ralph
,
"
use
to
go
down
to
the
house
in
Leicestershire
pretty
often
,
and
stop
there
many
day
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
have
a
great
many
dealing
together
,
and
he
may
have
go
on
some
of
those
,
or
to
patch
up
his
client
's
affair
,
which
be
in
a
ruinous
state
;
of
course
he
go
for
profit
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentlewoman
be
not
a
girl
,
but
she
be
,
I
have
hear
say
,
handsome
,
and
entitle
to
a
pretty
large
property
.
 
<EOS>
in
course
of
time
,
he
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
same
love
of
gain
which
lead
him
to
contract
this
marriage
,
lead
to
its
being
keep
strictly
private
;
for
a
clause
in
her
father
's
will
declare
that
if
she
marry
without
her
brother
's
consent
,
the
property
,
in
which
she
have
only
some
life
interest
while
she
remain
single
,
should
pass
away
altogether
to
another
branch
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
the
brother
would
give
no
consent
that
the
sister
do
not
buy
,
and
pay
for
handsomely
;
Mr
Nickleby
would
consent
to
no
such
sacrifice
;
and
so
they
go
on
,
keep
their
marriage
secret
,
and
wait
for
him
to
break
his
neck
or
die
of
a
fever
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
neither
,
and
meanwhile
the
result
of
this
private
marriage
be
a
son
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
be
put
out
to
nurse
,
a
long
way
off
;
his
mother
never
see
him
but
once
or
twice
,
and
then
by
stealth
;
and
his
father
---
so
eagerly
do
he
thirst
after
the
money
which
seem
to
come
almost
within
his
grasp
now
,
for
his
brother
-
in
-
law
be
very
ill
,
and
break
more
and
more
every
day
---
never
go
near
him
,
to
avoid
raise
any
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
the
brother
linger
on
;
Mr
Nickleby
's
wife
constantly
urge
him
to
avow
their
marriage
;
he
peremptorily
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
She
remain
alone
in
a
dull
country
house
:
see
little
or
no
company
but
riotous
,
drunken
sportsman
.
<EOS>
He
live
in
London
and
cling
to
his
business
.
 
<EOS>
angry
quarrel
and
recrimination
take
place
,
and
when
they
have
be
marry
nearly
seven
year
,
and
be
within
a
few
week
of
the
time
when
the
brother
's
death
would
have
adjust
all
,
she
elope
with
a
young
man
,
and
leave
him
.

<EOS>
here
he
pause
,
but
Ralph
do
not
stir
,
and
the
brother
sign
to
him
to
proceed
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
then
that
I
become
acquainted
with
these
circumstance
from
his
own
lip
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
no
secret
then
;
for
the
brother
,
and
other
,
know
them
;
but
they
be
communicate
to
me
,
not
on
this
account
,
but
because
I
be
want
.
 
<EOS>
He
follow
the
fugitive
.
 
<EOS>
some
say
to
make
money
of
his
wife
's
shame
,
but
,
I
believe
,
to
take
some
violent
revenge
,
for
that
be
as
much
his
character
as
the
other
;
perhaps
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
find
them
,
and
she
die
not
long
after
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
he
begin
to
think
he
may
like
the
child
,
or
whether
he
wish
to
make
sure
that
it
should
never
fall
into
its
mother
's
hand
;
but
,
before
he
go
,
he
intrust
me
with
the
charge
of
bring
it
home
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
go
on
,
from
this
point
,
in
a
still
more
humble
tone
,
and
speak
in
a
very
low
voice
;
point
to
Ralph
as
he
resume
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
have
use
me
ill
---
cruelly
---
I
remind
him
in
what
,
not
long
ago
when
I
meet
him
in
the
street
---
and
I
hate
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
bring
the
child
home
to
his
own
house
,
and
lodge
him
in
the
front
garret
.
 
<EOS>
Neglect
have
make
him
very
sickly
,
and
I
be
oblige
to
call
in
a
doctor
,
who
say
he
must
be
remove
for
change
of
air
,
or
he
would
die
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
first
put
it
in
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
it
then
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
go
six
week
,
and
when
he
come
back
,
I
tell
him
---
with
every
circumstance
well
plan
and
prove
;
nobody
could
have
suspect
me
---
that
the
child
be
dead
and
bury
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
have
be
disappoint
in
some
intention
he
have
form
,
or
he
may
have
have
some
natural
affection
,
but
he
be
grieve
at
that
,
and
I
be
confirm
in
my
design
of
opening
up
the
secret
one
day
,
and
make
it
a
means
of
get
money
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
,
like
most
other
man
,
of
Yorkshire
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
the
child
to
one
keep
by
a
man
name
Squeers
,
and
leave
it
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
the
name
of
Smike
.
 
<EOS>
year
by
year
,
I
pay
twenty
pound
a
-
year
for
him
for
six
year
;
never
breathe
the
secret
all
the
time
;
for
I
have
leave
his
father
's
service
after
more
hard
usage
,
and
quarrel
with
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
send
away
from
this
country
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
away
nearly
eight
year
.
<EOS>
directly
I
come
home
again
,
I
travel
down
into
Yorkshire
,
and
,
skulk
in
the
village
of
an
evening
-
time
,
make
inquiry
about
the
boy
at
the
school
,
and
find
that
this
one
,
whom
I
have
place
there
,
have
run
away
with
a
young
man
bear
the
name
of
his
own
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
seek
his
father
out
in
London
,
and
hint
at
what
I
could
tell
him
,
try
for
a
little
money
to
support
life
;
but
he
repulse
me
with
threat
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
find
out
his
clerk
,
and
,
go
on
from
little
to
little
,
and
show
him
that
there
be
good
reason
for
communicate
with
me
,
learn
what
be
go
on
;
and
it
be
I
who
tell
him
that
the
boy
be
no
son
of
the
man
who
claim
to
be
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
I
have
never
see
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
I
hear
from
this
same
source
that
he
be
very
ill
,
and
where
he
be
.
<EOS>
I
travel
down
there
,
that
I
may
recall
myself
,
if
possible
,
to
his
recollection
and
confirm
my
story
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
upon
him
unexpectedly
;
but
before
I
could
speak
<EOS>
he
know
me
<EOS>
---
he
have
good
cause
to
remember
me
,
poor
lad
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
I
would
have
swear
to
him
if
I
have
meet
him
in
the
Indies
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
piteous
face
I
have
see
in
the
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
few
day
'
indecision
,
I
apply
to
the
young
gentleman
in
whose
care
he
be
,
and
I
find
that
he
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
how
quickly
he
recognise
me
again
,
how
often
he
have
describe
me
and
<EOS>
my
leave
him
at
the
school
,
and
how
he
tell
him
of
a
garret
he
recollect
:
which
be
the
one
I
have
speak
of
,
and
in
his
father
's
house
to
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
my
story
.
 
<EOS>
I
demand
to
be
bring
face
to
face
with
the
schoolmaster
,
and
put
to
any
possible
proof
of
any
part
of
it
,
and
I
will
show
that
it
be
too
true
,
and
that
I
have
this
guilt
upon
my
soul
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
unhappy
man
!
"
say
the
brother
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
reparation
can
you
make
for
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
none
,
gentleman
,
none
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
none
to
make
,
and
nothing
to
hope
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
old
in
year
,
and
old
still
in
misery
and
care
.
 
<EOS>
this
confession
can
bring
nothing
upon
me
but
new
suffering
and
punishment
;
but
I
make
it
,
and
will
abide
by
it
whatever
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
make
the
instrument
of
work
out
this
dreadful
retribution
upon
the
head
of
a
man
who
,
in
the
hot
pursuit
of
his
bad
end
,
have
persecute
and
hunt
down
his
own
child
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
descend
upon
me
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
must
fall
.
 
<EOS>
My
reparation
come
too
late
;
and
,
neither
in
this
world
nor
in
the
next
,
can
I
have
hope
again
!

hardly

lamp

which
stand
upon
the
table
close
to
where
Ralph

to

there
be
some
trifle
confusion
in
obtain
another
light

the
interval
be
a
mere
nothing

when
the
light
appear
,
Ralph

be
go

<EOS>
the
good
brother
and
Tim
Linkinwater
occupy
some
time
in
discuss
the
probability
of
his
return

,
when
it
become
apparent
that
he
would
not
come
back
,
they
hesitate
whether
or
no
to
send
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
remember
how
strangely
and
silently
he
have
sit
in
one
immovable
position
during
the
interview
,
and
think
he
may
possibly
be
ill
,
they
determine
,
although
it
be
now
very
late
,
to
send
to
his
house
on
some
pretence
.
 
<EOS>
find
an
excuse
in
the
presence
of
Brooker
,
whom
they
know
not
how
to
dispose
of
without
consult
his
wish
,
they
conclude
to
act
upon
this
resolution
before
go

mourn

the

you

be
sorry
for
it
presently

Nay

Nicholas
gently

what

reward
could
I
have

than
the
knowledge
that

peaceful

the
recollection
that

Miss

very
true

I

impious

wicked
little
fool

know

with
that

good

to

afresh

herself

laugh

the
laugh

the
cry

meet
each
other
thus
abruptly

a
struggle
for
the
mastery

the
result

,
that
it

draw
battle

into
hysteric

honestly
tell
her
this
;

it
be
so
far
off

in

distant
perspective

many
year
must
elapse

I

first
intrust

they
repose
unbounded
confidence

believe
that
I

if
the

teach

reflect

awaken

rich

what

yesterday

it

seem

tomorrow

look
back

look
back

of

recollect
with
a
melancholy
pleasure

the
time
be

could
move
us

perhaps
then
,
when

be
quaint
old

talk

the
time

light

our
hair
not
grey

we
may
be
even
thankful
for
the
trial
that
so
endear
us

turn
our

into
that
current

down

calmly

young

be
now

may
come
to
us
for
sympathy

pour
distress
which
hope

inexperience

scarcely
feel
enough

into
the
compassionate
ear

the
old
bachelor
brother

his
maiden
sister

Kate
smile
through
her
tear

this
picture

silence

quite

It
be
no

ten
thousand

would

in
his
generous
affection

cheek

downcast
eye

have
bestow
its
utmost
farthing
,
in
perfect
forgetfulness
of
himself

to
secure
her
happiness

all
he
could
do
be
to
comfort
and
console
her
by
kind
word
;

<EOS>
word
they
be
of
such
love
and
kindness
,
and
cheerful
encouragement

poor
Kate
throw
her
arm
about
his
neck

declare
she
would
weep
no
more

Nicholas
proudly
,

on
his
way

soon
afterwards

would
not

sufficiently
reward

fortune

that

light

heavy

money

where
would
it
buy
him
such
a

in
unequal

the
rich

be
always
suppose
to
make
a
great
sacrifice

the
other
to
get
a
good
bargain

him
no

great

I
find

in

I

I
implore

remove
this
young

be
now
your
ward

the
object
of
your
peculiar

my
love

must
appear
the
height
of
rashness

presumption

I

who
can

that

again

"
   
<EOS>
upon
this
head
,
Nicholas
request
permission
to
add
a
few
word
.
<EOS>
He
venture
to
hope
that
nothing
he
have
say
would
lead
to
the
estrangement
of
Kate
and
Madeline
,
who
have
form
an
attachment
for
each
other
,
any
interruption
of
which
would
,
he
know
,
be
attend
with
great
pain
to
them
,
and
,
most
of
all
,
with
remorse
and
pain
to
him
,
as
its
unhappy
cause
.
 
<EOS>
when
these
thing
be
all
forget
,
he
hope
that
Frank
and
he
may
still
be
warm
friend
,
and
that
no
word
or
thought
of
his
humble
home
,
or
of
her
who
be
well
contented
to
remain
there
and
share
his
quiet
fortune
,
would
ever
again
disturb
the
harmony
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
recount
,
as
nearly
as
he
could
,
what
have
pass
between
himself
and
Kate
that
morning
:
<EOS>
speak
of
her
with
such
warmth
of
pride
and
affection
,
and
dwell
so
cheerfully
upon
the
confidence
they
have
of
overcome
any
selfish
regret
and
live
contented
and
happy
in
each
other
's
love
,
that
few
could
have
hear
him
unmoved
.
 
<EOS>
More
move
himself
than
he
have
be
yet
,
he
express
in
a
few
hurried
word
---
as
expressive
,
perhaps
,
as
the
most
eloquent
phrase
---
his
devotion
to
the
brother
,
and
his
hope
that
he
may
live
and
die
in
their
service
.
   
<EOS>
to
all
this
,
brother
Charles
listen
in
profound
silence
,
and
with
his
chair
so
turn
from
Nicholas
that
his
face
could
not
be
see

<EOS>
He
have
not
speak
either
,
in
his
accustomed
manner
,
but
with
a
certain
stiffness
and
embarrassment
very
foreign
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
fear
he
have
offend
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
no
,
no
,
he
have
do
quite
right
,

but
that
be
all

<EOS>
"
Frank

a
heedless
,
foolish
fellow

he
say
,
after
Nicholas
have
pause
for
some
time
;
"
a
very
heedless

foolish
fellow

<EOS>
I
will
take
care

be
bring
to

close
without

<EOS>
let
us
say
no
more
upon

painful

half
an
hour

have
strange

appoint
this
afternoon
for
your
waiting
upon

<EOS>

cry
Nicholas

<EOS>
"
ay

"
reply
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
return
to
me
in
half
an
hour

and
I
will
tell
you
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
wait
upon
him
at
the
time
mention
,
and
then
learn
all
that
have
take
place
on
the
previous
day
,
and
all
that
be
know
of
the
appointment
Ralph
have
make
with
the
brother
;
which
be
for
that
night
;
and
for
the
well
understanding
of
which
it
will
be
requisite
to
return
and
follow
his
own
footstep
from
the
house
of
the
twin
brother
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
we
leave
Nicholas
somewhat
reassure
by
the
restore
kindness
of
their
manner
towards
him
,
and
yet
sensible
that
it
be
different
from
what
it
have
be
(
though
he
scarcely
know
in
what
respect
)
<EOS>
:
so
he
be
full
of
uneasiness
,
uncertainty
,
and
disquiet

Ralph
make
one
last
Appointment
---
and
keep
it
 
creep
from
the
house

and
slink
off
like
a
thief
;
grope
with
his
hand
,
when
first
he
get
into
the
street
,
as
if
he
be
a
blind
man
;

look
often
over
his

while
he
hurry
away
,
as

he
be
follow
in
imagination
or
reality
by
someone
anxious
to
question

detain
him

leave
the
city
behind

road

furiously

fast

before

there
be
one
black
,
gloomy
mass

seem
to
follow
him

not
hurry
in
the
wild
chase
with
the
other
,
but
linger
sullenly
behind
,
and
glide
darkly
and
stealthily
on

often
look
back
at
this
,
and
,
more
than
once
,
stop
to
let
it
pass
over
;
but
,
somehow
,
when
he
go
forward
again
,
it
be
still
behind
him
,
come
mournfully
and
slowly
up
,
like
a
shadowy
funeral
train
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
to
pass
a
poor
,
mean
burial
-
ground
---
a
dismal
place
,
raise
a
few
foot
above
the
level
of
the
street
,
and
part
from
it
by
a
low
parapet
-
wall
and
an
iron
railing
;
a
rank
,
unwholesome
,
rotten
spot
,
where
the
very
grass
and
weed
seem
,
in
their
frouzy
growth
,
to
tell
that
they
have
spring
from
pauper
'
body
,
and
have
strike
their
root
in
the
grave
of
man
,
sodden
,
while
alive
,
in
steam
court
and
drunken
hungry
den
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
,
in
truth
,
they
lie
,
part
from
the
living
by
a
little
earth
and
a
board
or
two
---
lay
thick
and
close
---
corrupt
in
body
as
they
have
in
mind
---
a
dense
and
squalid
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
here
they
lay
,
cheek
by
jowl
with
life
:
<EOS>
no
deep
down
than
the
foot
of
the
throng
that
pass
there
every
day
,
and
pile
high
as
their
throat
.
 
<EOS>
here
they
lay
,
a
grisly
family
,
all
these
dear
depart
brother
and
sister
of
the
ruddy
clergyman
who
do
his
task
so
speedily
when
they
be
hide
in
the
ground
!
   
<EOS>
as
he
pass
here
,
Ralph
call
to
mind
that
he
have
be
one
of
a
jury
,
long
before
,
on
the
body
of
a
man
who
have
cut
his
throat
;
and
that
he
be
bury
in
this
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
tell
how
he
come
to
recollect
it
now
,
when
he
have
so
often
pass
and
never
think
about
him
,
or
how
it
be
that
he
feel
an
interest
in
the
circumstance
;
but
he
do
both
;
and
stop
,
and
clasp
the
iron
railing
with
his
hand
,
look
eagerly
in
,
wonder
which
may
be
his
grave
.
   
<EOS>
while
he
be
thus
engage
,
there
come
towards
him
,
with
noise
of
shout
and
singing
,
some
fellow
full
of
drink
,
follow
by
other
,
who
be
remonstrate
with
them
and
urge
them
to
go
home
in
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
in
high
good
-
humour
;
and
one
of
them
,
a
little
,
weazen
,
hump
-
backed
man
,
begin
to
dance
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
grotesque
,
fantastic
figure
,
and
the
few
bystander
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
Ralph
himself
be
move
to
mirth
,
and
echo
the
laugh
of
one
who
stand
near
and
who
look
round
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
have
pass
on
,
and
he
be
leave
alone
again
,
he
resume
his
speculation
with
a
new
kind
of
interest
;
for
he
recollect
that
the
last
person
who
have
see
the
suicide
alive
,
have
leave
him
very
merry
,
and
he
remember
how
strange
he
and
the
other
juror
have
think
that
at
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
He
could
not
fix
upon
the
spot
among
such
a
heap
of
grave
,
but
he
conjure
up
a
strong
and
vivid
idea
of
the
man
himself
,
and
how
he
look
,
and
what
have
lead
him
to
do
it
;
all
of
which
he
recall
with
ease
.
 
<EOS>
by
dint
of
dwell
upon
this
theme
,
he
carry
the
impression
with
him
when
he
go
away
;
as
he
remember
,
when
a
child
,
to
have
have
frequently
before
him
the
figure
of
some
goblin
he
have
once
see
chalk
upon
a
door
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
draw
nearer
and
near
home
he
forget
it
again
,
and
begin
to
think
how
very
dull
and
solitary
the
house
would
be
inside
.
   
<EOS>
this
feeling
become
so
strong
at
last
,
that
when
he
reach
his
own
door
,
he
could
hardly
make
up
his
mind
to
turn
the
key
and
open
it
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
that
,
and
go
into
the
passage
,
he
feel
as
though
to
shut
it
again
would
be
to
shut
out
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
let
it
go
,
and
it
close
with
a
loud
noise
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
light
.
 
<EOS>
how
very
dreary
,
cold
,
and
still
it
be
!
   
<EOS>
shiver
from
head
to
foot
,
he
make
his
way
upstairs
into
the
room
where
he
have
be
last
disturb
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
make
a
kind
of
compact
with
himself
that
he
would
not
think
of
what
have
happen
until
he
get
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
at
home
now
,
and
suffer
himself
to
consider
it
.
   
<EOS>
His
own
child
,
his
own
child
!
 
<EOS>
He
never
doubt
the
tale
;
he
feel
it
be
true
;
know
it
as
well
,
now
,
as
if
he
have
be
privy
to
it
all
along
.
 
<EOS>
His
own
child
!
 
<EOS>
and
dead
too
.
 
<EOS>
die
beside
Nicholas
,
love
him
,
and
look
upon
him
as
something
like
an
angel
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
bad
!
   
<EOS>
They
have
all
turn
from
him
and
desert
him
in
his
very
first
need
.
 
<EOS>
even
money
could
not
buy
them
now
;
everything
must
come
out
,
and
everybody
must
know
all
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
the
young
lord
dead
,
<EOS>
his
companion
abroad
and
beyond
his
reach
,
ten
thousand
pound
go
at
one
blow
,
his
plot
with
Gride
overset
at
the
very
moment
of
triumph
,
his
after
-
scheme
discover
,
himself
in
danger
,
the
object
of
his
persecution
and
Nicholas
's
love
,
his
own
wretched
boy
;
everything
crumble
and
fall
upon
him
,
and
he
beat
down
beneath
the
ruin
and
grovel
in
the
dust
.
   
<EOS>
if
he
have
know
his
child
to
be
alive
;
if
no
deceit
have
be
ever
practise
,
and
he
have
grow
up
beneath
his
eye
;
he
may
have
be
a
careless
,
indifferent
,
rough
,
harsh
father
---
like
enough
---
he
feel
that
;
but
the
thought
would
come
that
he
may
have
be
otherwise
,
and
that
his
son
may
have
be
a
comfort
to
him
,
and
they
two
happy
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
to
think
now
,
that
his
suppose
death
and
his
wife
's
flight
have
have
some
share
in
make
him
the
morose
,
hard
man
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
remember
a
time
when
he
be
not
quite
so
rough
and
obdurate
;
and
almost
think
that
he
have
first
hate
Nicholas
because
he
be
young
and
gallant
,
and
perhaps
like
the
stripling
who
have
bring
dishonour
and
loss
of
fortune
on
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
but
one
tender
think
,
or
one
of
natural
regret
,
in
his
whirlwind
of
passion
and
remorse
,
be
as
a
drop
of
calm
water
in
a
stormy
madden
sea
.
 
<EOS>
His
hatred
of
Nicholas
have
be
feed
upon
his
own
defeat
,
nourish
on
his
interference
with
his
scheme
,
fatten
upon
his
old
defiance
and
success
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
reason
for
its
increase
;
it
have
grow
and
strengthen
gradually
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
attain
a
height
which
be
sheer
wild
lunacy
.
 
<EOS>
that
his
,
of
all
other
,
should
have
be
the
hand
to
rescue
his
miserable
child
;
that
he
should
have
be
his
protector
and
faithful
friend
;
that
he
should
have
show
him
that
love
and
tenderness
which
,
from
the
wretched
moment
of
his
birth
,
he
have
never
know
;
that
he
should
have
teach
him
to
hate
his
own
parent
and
execrate
his
very
name
;
that
he
should
now
know
and
feel
all
this
,
and
triumph
in
the
recollection
;
be
gall
and
madness
to
the
usurer
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
the
dead
boy
's
love
for
Nicholas
,
and
the
attachment
of
Nicholas
to
him
,
be
insupportable
agony
.
 
<EOS>
the
picture
of
his
deathbed
,
with
Nicholas
at
his
side
,
tend
and
support
him
,
and
he
breathe
out
his
thank
,
and
expire
in
his
arm
,
when
he
would
have
have
them
mortal
enemy
and
hate
each
other
to
the
last
,
drive
him
frantic
.
 
<EOS>
He
gnash
his
tooth
and
smote
the
air
,
and
look
wildly
round
,
with
eye
which
gleam
through
the
darkness
,
cry
aloud
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
trample
down
and
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
the
wretch
tell
me
true
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
have
come
!
 
<EOS>
be
there
no
way
to
rob
them
of
further
triumph
,
and
spurn
their
mercy
and
compassion
?
 
<EOS>
be
there
no
devil
to
help
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
swiftly
,
there
glide
again
into
his
brain
the
figure
he
have
raise
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
lie
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
head
be
cover
now
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
when
he
first
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
rigid
,
upturned
,
marble
foot
too
<EOS>
,
he
remember
well
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
before
him
the
pale
and
tremble
relative
who
have
tell
their
tale
upon
the
inquest
---
the
shriek
of
woman
---
<EOS>
the
silent
dread
of
man
---
the
consternation
and
disquiet
---
the
victory
achieve
by
that
heap
of
clay
,
which
,
with
one
motion
of
its
hand
,
have
let
out
the
life
and
make
this
stir
among
them
---
   
<EOS>
He
speak
no
more
;
but
,
after
a
pause
,
softly
grope
his
way
out
of
the
room
,
and
up
the
echoing
stair
---
up
to
the
top
---
to
the
front
garret
---
where
he
close
the
door
behind
him
,
and
remain
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
mere
lumber
-
room
now
,
but
it
yet
contain
an
old
dismantle
bedstead
;
the
one
on
which
his
son
have
sleep
;
for
no
other
have
ever
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
avoid
it
hastily
,
and
sit
down
as
far
from
it
as
he
could
.
   
<EOS>
the
weakened
glare
of
the
light
in
the
street
below
,
shine
through
the
window
which
have
no
blind
or
curtain
to
intercept
it
,
be
enough
to
show
the
character
of
the
room
,
though
not
sufficient
fully
to
reveal
the
various
article
of
lumber
,
old
corded
trunk
and
broken
furniture
,
which
be
scatter
about
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
a
shelving
roof
;
high
in
one
part
,
and
at
another
descending
almost
to
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
towards
the
high
part
that
Ralph
direct
his
eye
;
and
upon
it
he
keep
them
fix
steadily
for
some
minute
,
when
he
rise
,
and
drag
thither
an
old
chest
upon
which
he
have
be
seat
,
mount
on
it
,
and
feel
along
the
wall
above
his
head
with
both
hand
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
they
touch
a
large
iron
hook
,
firmly
drive
into
one
of
the
beam
.
   
<EOS>
at
that
moment
,
he
be
interrupt
by
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
below
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
little
hesitation
he
open
the
window
,
and
demand
who
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
Mr
Nickleby
,
"
reply
a
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
with
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
Mr
Nickleby
's
voice
,
surely
?
"
be
the
rejoinder
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
like
it
;
but
it
be
Ralph
who
speak
,
and
so
he
say
.
   
<EOS>
the
voice
make
answer
that
the
twin
brother
wish
to
know
whether
the
man
whom
he
have
see
that
night
be
to
be
detain
;
and
that
although
it
be
now
midnight
they
have
send
,
in
their
anxiety
to
do
right
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
cry
Ralph
,
"
detain
him
till
tomorrow
;
then
let
them
bring
him
here
---
him
and
my
nephew
---
and
come
themselves
,
and
be
sure
that
I
will
be
ready
to
receive
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
at
what
hour
?
"
ask
the
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
at
any
hour
,
"
reply
Ralph
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
the
afternoon
,
tell
them
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
hour
,
at
any
minute
.
 
<EOS>
all
time
will
be
alike
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
listen
to
the
man
's
retreat
footstep
until
the
sound
have
pass
,
and
then
,
gaze
up
into
the
sky
,
see
,
or
think
he
see
,
the
same
black
cloud
that
have
seem
to
follow
him
home
,
and
which
now
appear
to
hover
directly
above
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
its
meaning
now
,
"
he
mutter
,
"
and
the
restless
night
,
the
dream
,
and
why
I
have
quail
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
all
point
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
man
by
sell
their
own
soul
could
ride
rampant
for
a
term
,
for
how
short
a
term
would
I
barter
mine
tonight
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
sound
of
a
deep
bell
come
along
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
one
.
   
<EOS>
"

the

re
merrily

and
re
chime
for
the
come
in
of
every

<EOS>
no

me
!
 
<EOS>
throw
me
on
a
dunghill
,
and
let
me
rot
there
,
to
infect
the
air
!
"
   
<EOS>
with
a
wild
look
around
,
in
which
frenzy
,
hatred
,
and
despair
be
horribly
mingle
,
he
shake
his
clenched
hand
at
the
sky
above
him
,
which
be
still
dark
and
threatening
,
and
close
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
the
rain
and
hail
patter
against
the
glass
;
the
chimney
quake
and
rock
;
the
crazy
casement
rattle
with
the
wind
,
as
though
an
impatient
hand
inside
be
strive
to
burst
it
open
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
hand
be
there
,
and
it
open
no

<EOS>
"
how

"
cry
one

<EOS>
"
the

another

for
he

somebody
out

window
upstairs

They
be
a
little
knot
of
man
,
and
,
the
window
be
mention
,
go
out
into
the
road
to
look
up
at

this
occasion
their

close
shut

as
the

she

round
to
the

,
and
so
enter
by
a
window
,
while
the
other
remain
outside
,
in
impatient
expectation
.
   
<EOS>
They
look
into
all
the
room
below
:
open
the
shutter
as
they
go
,
to
admit
the
fading
light
:
and
still
find
nobody
,
and
everything
quiet
and
in
its
place
,
doubt
whether
they
should
go
farther
.
 
<EOS>
one
man
,
however
,
remark
that
they
have
not
yet
be
into
the
garret
,
and
that
it
be
there
he
have
be
last
see
,
they
agree
to
look
there
too
,
and
go
up
softly
;
for
the
mystery
and
silence
make
them
timid
.
   
<EOS>
after
they
have
stand
for
an
instant
,
on
the
landing
,
eye
each
other
,
he
who
have
propose
their

the
search
so
far
,
turn
the
handle
of
the
door
,
and
,
push
it
open
,
look
through
the
chink
,
and
fall
back
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
odd
,
"
he
whisper
,
"
he
be
hide
behind
the
door
!
 
<EOS>
look
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
press
forward
to
see
;
but
one
among
them
thrust
the
other
aside
with
a
loud
exclamation
,
draw
a
clasp
-
knife
from
his
pocket
,
and
dash
into
the
room
,
cut
down
the
body
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
tear
a
rope
from
one
of
the
old
trunk
,
and
hang
himself
on
an
iron
hook
immediately
below
the
trap
-
door
in
the
ceiling
---
in
the
very
place
to
which
the
eye
of
his
son
,
a
lonely
,
desolate
,
little
creature
,
have
so
often
be
direct
in
childish
terror
,

to
this

when
there
come
one
evening
,
per
favour
of
Mr
Linkinwater
,
an
invitation
from
the
brother
to
dinner
on
the
next
day

one
:
comprehending
,
not

Mrs

now

Mrs

when
they
have
render
become
honour
to
the
bidding

and
<EOS>
Tim
have
take
his
departure

"
what

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
what

ask
Nicholas

<EOS>
"
I

my

rejoin
that

with
a
face
of
unfathomable
mystery

this
invitation
to
dinner
mean
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
its
intention
and
object
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
conclude
it
mean
,
that
on
such
a
day
we
be
to
eat
and
drink
in
their
house
,
and
that
its
intent
and
object
be
to
confer
pleasure
upon
us

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
that
be
all
you

I
have
not

deep

<EOS>
"
then
I
will
just
tell
you
one
thing
,
"
say
Mrs
Nickleby
,
you
will
find
yourself
a
little
surprised
;
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
it
that
this
mean
something
besides
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
tea
and
supper
,
perhaps
,
"
suggest
Nicholas
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
be
absurd
,
my
dear
,
if
I
be
you
,
"
reply
Mrs
Nickleby
,
in
a
lofty
manner
,
"
because
it
be
not
by
any
mean
become
,
and
do
not
suit
you
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
mean
to
say
be
,
that
the
Mr
Cheerybles
do
not
ask
us
to
dinner
with
all
this
ceremony
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
never
mind
;
wait
and
see
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
believe
anything
I
say
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
much
well
to
wait
;
a
great
deal
better
;
it
be
satisfactory
to
all
party
,
and
there
can
be
no
disputing
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
say
be
,
remember
what
I
say
now
,
and
when
I
say
I
say
so
,
do
not
say
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
with
this
stipulation
,
Mrs
Nickleby
,
who
be
trouble
,
night
and
day
,
with
a
vision
of
a
hot
messenger
tear
up
to
the
door
to
announce
that
Nicholas
have
be
take
into
partnership
,
quit
that
branch
of
the
subject
,
and
enter
upon
a
new
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
very
extraordinary
thing
,
"
she
say
,
"
a
most
extraordinary
thing
,
that
they
should
have
invite
Miss
La
Creevy
.
 
<EOS>
It
quite
astonish
me
,
upon
my
word
it
do
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
very
pleasant
that
she
should
be
invite
,
very
pleasant
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
she
will
conduct
herself
extremely
well
;
she
always
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
gratifying
to
think
that
we
should
have
be
the
mean
of
introduce
her
into
such
society
,
and
I
be
quite
glad
of
it
---
quite
rejoice
<EOS>
---
for
she
certainly
be
an
exceedingly
well
-
behave
and
good
-
natured
little
person
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
wish
that
some
friend
would
mention
to
her
how
very
badly
she
have
her
cap
trim
,
and
what
very
preposterous
bow
those
be
,
but
of
course
that
be
impossible
,
and
if
she
like
to
make
a
fright
of
herself
,
no
doubt
she
have
a
perfect
right
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
see
ourselves
---
never
do
,
and
never
do
---
and
I
suppose
we
never
shall
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
moral
reflection
remind
her
of
the
necessity
of
be
peculiarly
smart
on
the
occasion
,
so
as
to
counterbalance
Miss
La
Creevy
,
and
be
herself
an
effectual
set
-
off
and
atonement
,
lead
Mrs
Nickleby
into
a
consultation
with
her
daughter
relative
to
certain
ribbon
,
glove
,
and
trimming
:
which
,
be
a
complicated
question
,
and
one
of
paramount
importance
,
soon
route
the
previous
one
,
and
put
it
to
flight

the
great
day
arrive

the
good
lady
put
herself
under
Kate

hand
an
hour
or
so
after
breakfast

and
,
dress
by
easy
stage
,
complete
her
toilette
in
sufficient
time
to
allow
of
her
daughter
's
make
her
,
which
be
very
simple
,
and
not
very
long
,
though
so
satisfactory
that
she

never

charming

look
more
lovely

come
home
to
fetch
them

away
in

by
the

for
the
purpose

Mrs

wonder
very
much
what
they
would
have
for
dinner

cross
-
examine
Nicholas
as
to
the
extent
of
his
discovery
in
the
morning
;
whether
he
have
smell
anything
cook
at
all
like
turtle

if
not

what
he
have
smell
;
and
diversify
the
conversation
with
reminiscence
of
dinner
to
which
she
have
go
some
twenty
year
ago
,
concern
which
she
particularise
not
only
the
dish
but
the
guest
,
in
whom
her
hearer
do
not
feel
a
very
absorbing
interest

into
the
drawing

room

kindness

<EOS>
Tim
be
a
wild
young
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
He
want
gravity
and
steadiness
;
he
must
sow
his
wild
oat
,
and
then
perhaps
he
will
become
in
time
a
respectable
member
of
society
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
stand
joke
between
the
old
fellow
and
Tim
,
they
all
three
laugh
very
heartily
,
and
may
have
laugh
much
longer
,
but
that
the
brother
,
see
that
Mrs
Nickleby
be
labour
to
express
her
feeling
,
and
be
really
overwhelm
by
the
happiness
of
the
time
,
take
her
between
them
,
and
lead
her
from
the
room
under
pretence
of
have
to
consult
her
on
some
most
important
arrangement
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
Tim
and
Miss
La
Creevy
have
meet
very
often
,
and
have
always
be
very
chatty
and
pleasant
together
---
have
always
be
great
friend
---
and
consequently
it
be
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
Tim
,
find
that
she
still
sob
,
should
endeavour
to
console
her
.
<EOS>
as
Miss
La
Creevy
sit
on
a
large
old
-
fashioned
window
-
seat
,
where
there
be
ample
room
for
two
,
it
be
also
natural
that
Tim
should
sit
down
beside
her
;
and
as
to
Tim
's
be
unusually
spruce
and
particular
in
his
attire
that
day
,
why
it
be
a
high
festival
and
a
great
occasion
,
and
that
be
the
most
natural
thing
of
all
.
   
<EOS>
Tim
sit
down
beside
Miss
La
Creevy
,
and
,
cross
one
leg
over
the
other
so
that
his
foot
---
he
have
very
comely
foot
and
happen
to
be
wear
the
neat
shoe
and
black
silk
stocking
possible
---
should
come
easily
within
the
range
of
her
eye
,
say
in
a
soothing
way
:
   
"
do
not
cry
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
,
"
rejoin

<EOS>
"
no

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
happy
!
"
<EOS>
sob
the
little
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
laugh
,
"
say
Tim
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
laugh
.
"
   
<EOS>
what
in
the
world
<EOS>
Tim
be
do
with
his
arm
,
it
be
impossible
to
conjecture
,
but
he
knock
his
elbow
against
that
part
of
the
window
which
be
quite
on
the
other
side
of
Miss
La
Creevy
;
and
it
be
clear
that
it
could
have
no
business
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
laugh
,
"
say
Tim
,
"
or
I
will
cry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
cry
?
"
ask
Miss
La

,
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
because
I
be
happy
too
,
"
say
Tim
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
both
happy
,
and
I
should
like
to
do
as
you
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
surely
,
there
never
be
a
man
who
fidget
as
Tim
must
have
do
then
;
for
he
knock
the
window
again
---
almost
in
the
same
place
---
and
Miss
La
Creevy
say
she
be
sure
he
would
break
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
say
Tim
,
"
that
you
would
be
pleased
with
this
scene
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
thoughtful
and
kind
to
remember
me
,
"
return
Miss
La
Creevy
.
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
could
have
delight
me
half
so
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
why
on
earth
should
Miss
La
Creevy
and
Tim
Linkinwater
have
say
all
this
in
a
whisper
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
secret
.
 
<EOS>
and
why
should
Tim
Linkinwater
have
look
so
hard
at
Miss
La
Creevy
,
and
why
should
miss
La
Creevy
have
look
so
hard
at
the
ground
?
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pleasant
thing
,
"
say
Tim
,
"
to
people
like
us
,
who
have
pass
all
our
life
in
the
world
alone

to
see
young

quite
solitary

now
do
not
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
La
Creevy
say
she
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
and
why
should
she
say
she
do
not
know
?
 
<EOS>
because
she
must
have
know
whether
it
do
or
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
almost
enough
to
make
us
get
marry
after
all
,
be
not
it
?
"
say
Tim
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh

<EOS>
"
We

"
   
<EOS>
"
not
a
bit

"
say
Tim
;
"
we
be
too
old
to
be
single

<EOS>
why
should
not
we
both
be
married
,
instead
of
sit
through
the
long
winter
evening
by
our
solitary
fireside
?
 
<EOS>
why
should
not
we
make
one
fireside
of
it

<EOS>
"
oh

"
I

yearn
towards
plain
John
Browdie

<EOS>
He
remember
their
first
meeting
with
a
smile
,
and
their
second
with
a
tear
;
see
poor
Smike
once
again
with
the
bundle
on
his
shoulder
trudge
patiently
by
his
side
;
and
hear
the
honest
Yorkshireman

rough
word
of
encouragement
as
he
leave
them
on
their
road
to
London
.
   
<EOS>
Madeline
<EOS>
and
he
sit
down
,
very
many
time

jointly
to
produce
a
letter
which
should
acquaint
John

full
length
with
his
altered
fortune

assure
him
of
his
friendship

<EOS>
It
so
happen
,
however
,
that
the
letter
could
never
be
write

<EOS>
although
they
apply
themselves
to
it
with
the
good
intention
in

it
chance
that
they
always
fall
to
talk
about
something
else

when
Nicholas
try
it
by

,
he
find
it
impossible
to
write
one

half
of
what
he
wish
to

to
pen
anything
,
indeed
,
which
on

do
not

unsatisfactory
compare

at
last

after
go

him

to
make
a
hasty
trip
into
Yorkshire

present
himself
before
Mr

They

,
as
it
be
a
fine

they

both
be

happy

then
to

he
could
find
no

and
be
fain
to
turn
back
again

Mr

turn
round

catch

,
without

leapt
at
one
bind
into
a
bed

the

look

first
at

then
at
Mr

as

uncertain
on
whom
to
visit
this
extraordinary
behaviour
;

Mr

happen
by
ill

luck
to
thrust
his
nose
from

she
suddenly

with
a
dexterity

be
acquire
by

fling
a

heavy

at

good
an

Nicholas
hurry
Kate
off
,
and
leave
the
unfortunate
subject
of
this
unexpected
recognition
to
explain
his
conduct
as
he
best
could
.
   
<EOS>
the
next
morning
he
begin
his
journey
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
cold
,
winter
weather
:
forcibly
recall
to
his
mind
under
what
circumstance
he
have
first
travel
that
road
,
and
how
many
vicissitude
and
change
he
have
since
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
alone
inside
the
great
part
of
the
way
,
and
sometimes
,
when
he
have
fall
into
a
doze
,
and
,
rouse
himself
,
look
out
of
the
window
,
and
recognise
some
place
which
he
well
remember
as
have
pass
,
either
on
his
journey
down
,
or
in
the
long
walk
back
with
poor
Smike
,
he
could
hardly
believe
but
that
all
which
have
since
happen
have
be
a
dream
,
and
that
they
be
still
plod
wearily
on
towards
London
,
with
the
world
before
them
.
   
<EOS>
to
render
these
recollection
the
more
vivid
,
it
come
on
to
snow
as
night
set
in
;
and
,
pass
through
Stamford
and
Grantham
,
and
by
the
little
alehouse
where
he
have
hear
the
story
of
the
bold
Baron
of
Grogzwig
,
everything
look
as
if
he
have
see
it
but
<EOS>
yesterday
,
and
not
even
a
flake
of
the
white
crust
on
the
roof
have
melt
away
.
<EOS>
encourage
the
train
of
idea
which
flock
upon
him
,
he
could
almost
persuade
himself
that
he
sit
again
outside
the
coach
,
with
Squeers
and
the
boy
;
that
he
hear
their
voice
in
the
air
;
and
that
he
feel
again
,
but
with
a
mingle
sensation
of
pain
and
pleasure
now
,
that
old
sinking
of
the
heart
,
and
longing
after
home
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
yet
yield
himself
up
to
these
fancy
he
fall
asleep
,
and
,
dream
of
Madeline
,
forget
them
.

at
the
